sw4845A-ms98-a-0005 17.929375 45.752375 [silence]
sw4845A-ms98-a-0006 45.752375 50.628125 yeah i i[t]- it is it is to some degree inconvenient i'd have to say that
sw4845A-ms98-a-0007 50.628125 60.775125 uh around here they've given us mine already got run over um i[t]- it [vocalized-noise] looks sort of like a milk crate a little blue mil[k]- milk crate and i have two kids
sw4845A-ms98-a-0008 60.775125 71.338250 and it's not big [laughter-enough] it's it's kind of it's kind of silly and what you do is you put out paper like paper bags and newspaper and cardboard
sw4845A-ms98-a-0009 71.338250 83.097625 and that you put separately and you also put out in this little ridiculous container any cans or bottles you have you know like your Campbell soup cans and your milk cartons and that kind of stuff
sw4845A-ms98-a-0010 83.097625 87.366750 and then the rest you can ju[st]- you throw out and the town picks it up
sw4845A-ms98-a-0011 87.366750 99.508750 i've heard of communities where you have to separate your garbage and then put what's left in a clear plastic [ga/bag] bag so they can kind of look and see if you're throwing out what [laughter-you] [laughter-shouldn't] i thought that was [laughter-pretty] [laughter-amusing]
sw4845A-ms98-a-0012 99.508750 102.557000 i imagine i don't know
sw4845A-ms98-a-0013 102.557000 118.588875 [silence]
sw4845A-ms98-a-0014 118.588875 131.178875 well you know it's funny we just got back from a trip to California visiting some friends uh near San Francisco and San Jose and we'd see these signs on the road that said garbage pickup two exits down or something
sw4845A-ms98-a-0015 131.178875 141.648125 the apar[tment]- for the apartment dwellers they didn't make it easy to recycle at all what they did was um you would bring it to this garbage place that they designated
sw4845A-ms98-a-0016 141.648125 151.738125 and the Lions Club or you know some community organization would do you the favor of picking it up from there you really had to go out of your way to recycle
sw4845A-ms98-a-0017 151.738125 170.518375 [silence]
sw4845A-ms98-a-0018 170.518375 181.264750 well around here i it's not too bad because on Tuesdays you put out your paper and your cans and and plastic things and they go away so that i mean that's not too tough to put that at the end of your driveway
sw4845A-ms98-a-0019 181.264750 193.476625 uh my friends in California have this special garbage fill where they collect all their soda cans and they kind of leave it near the dumpster knowing that the neighborhood kids will grab them because they can sell them_1 or something for recycling
sw4845A-ms98-a-0020 193.476625 197.042250 so they just leave it out for the [laughter-vultures] [laughter-to] [laughter-take]
sw4845A-ms98-a-0021 197.042250 201.943500 [silence]
sw4845A-ms98-a-0022 201.943500 205.324625 oh well the soda cans where i live are good for a nickel a piece
sw4845A-ms98-a-0023 205.324625 218.553500 so if you bring them_1 to the local supermarket they have these can crushers and you know you throw all the cans in one at a time it takes ti[me]- a lot of time and uh you push a button and you get a nickel for every can because_1 some[one]- you had to pay a deposit on it when you bought it 
sw4845A-ms98-a-0024 218.553500 233.407625 and you find these old old men and these bag people collecting all these things and hauling them in in big garbage bags and they just like take up one of these machines to to get you know couple of mo[ney]- uh bucks for beer or [laughter-something]
sw4845A-ms98-a-0025 233.407625 239.167875 yeah it's a state well New York state does it and i know Vermont a lot of the eastern states do it
sw4845A-ms98-a-0026 239.167875 249.750750 so you get a lot of old people one old fellow had crates of beer he made friends with a barten[der]- a bartender at some bar and he gets all the beer bottles because_1 the guy can't be bothered with it
sw4845A-ms98-a-0027 249.750750 259.751875 and he said he bought himself i said that's pretty heavy for you isn't it and he says well i just bought myself an old station wagon to cart you know this is a real business for [laughter-him] he's making big [laughter-bucks]
sw4845A-ms98-a-0028 259.751875 261.779750 [silence]
sw4845A-ms98-a-0029 261.779750 270.664625 [laughter] well i guess at a nickel a shot if these people are retired and they've got nothing better to do i mean they can come away with ten fifteen dollars at a haul i guess 
sw4845A-ms98-a-0030 270.664625 274.827750 [silence]
sw4845A-ms98-a-0031 274.827750 284.748375 well you you do find people picking through the garbage pails at the beach you know my own kids have been guilty of that till they found that the bees were attracted to the Coke cans [laughter-and] [laughter-that] [laughter-was] [laughter-the] [laughter-end] [laughter-of] [laughter-that]
sw4845A-ms98-a-0032 284.748375 289.810750 [laughter] i think it's a fair you know for an eight year old to get three dollars it's like wow [laughter]
