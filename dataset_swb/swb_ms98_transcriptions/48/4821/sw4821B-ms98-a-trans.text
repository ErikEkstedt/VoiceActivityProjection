sw4821B-ms98-a-0004 29.487625 31.931000 [silence]
sw4821B-ms98-a-0005 31.931000 42.926125 uh-huh well i- i get a weekend paper as well and uh in addition to that i get a local weekly i- i live in suburb of Milwaukee and they get they
sw4821B-ms98-a-0006 42.926125 52.929875 have community newspapers around here so the local their extremely local [laughter] stuff uh is in the local paper that comes out once a week and then i get the Sunday 
sw4821B-ms98-a-0007 52.929875 65.669625 uh Milwaukee Journal because i don't have time to read a paper uh mostly that's my difficulty i uh i get my news pretty much from the same source as you do although i do listen to NPR
sw4821B-ms98-a-0008 65.669625 79.494500 which has very good and that's National Public Radio which has very good uh coverage of the national and international news i feel and does a pretty good job of analysis as well usually
sw4821B-ms98-a-0009 79.494500 87.335625 no i'm not actually uh but i can run my radio in my office i- i i teach at the university and when i'm not
sw4821B-ms98-a-0010 87.335625 92.443375 teaching if i choose to have the radio on i can listen to that station so
sw4821B-ms98-a-0011 92.443375 94.335125 [silence]
sw4821B-ms98-a-0012 94.335125 102.041750 ho[w]- how are you are you satisfied with the Twenty Twenty and Forty Eight Hours and the things that you do watch
sw4821B-ms98-a-0013 102.041750 105.951000 [silence]
sw4821B-ms98-a-0014 105.951000 107.209250 uh-huh
sw4821B-ms98-a-0015 107.209250 117.207000 [silence]
sw4821B-ms98-a-0016 117.207000 118.528750 um-hum
sw4821B-ms98-a-0017 118.528750 128.767125 [silence]
sw4821B-ms98-a-0018 128.767125 140.144500 is that the aspect of the news that you're most interested in is is the timely you no[ting]- noting of the events as they happen is that what you feel good about in the news coverage
sw4821B-ms98-a-0019 140.144500 149.483375 [silence]
sw4821B-ms98-a-0020 149.483375 151.005625 uh-huh
sw4821B-ms98-a-0021 151.005625 158.090125 well i- i myself uh the the reason why i listen to NPR and the reason why i watch MacNeil Lehrer rather than the
sw4821B-ms98-a-0022 158.090125 169.648625 than the network sh[ows]- news shows at night although i do o[ften]- watch a local ten o'clock in the evening news which sh[ows]- sh[ows]- you know carries over a lot of the national news stories uh is that
sw4821B-ms98-a-0023 169.648625 175.908875 quite often it seems to me that [noise] the national doesn't do a very good job of analysis
sw4821B-ms98-a-0024 175.908875 183.410750 the local doesn't either but i feel that MacNeil Lehrer get a little more deeply into some some of the issues that are really current
sw4821B-ms98-a-0025 183.410750 194.362625 and perhaps newspapers do that but as i said i don't have time to sit down and read a newspaper and frankly when i have [laughter-read] a newspaper i haven't noticed that kind of analysis either
sw4821B-ms98-a-0026 194.362625 196.975375 so um
sw4821B-ms98-a-0027 196.975375 203.627250 there's there is some danger to that of course too because if the analysis is inaccurate or biased or whatever then
sw4821B-ms98-a-0028 203.627250 206.345500 you know how good is it but
sw4821B-ms98-a-0029 206.345500 215.750500 uh i like a little more indepth coverage and i think that's what you're maybe appealing to you too on something like Twenty Twenty or Forty Eight Hours
sw4821B-ms98-a-0030 215.750500 218.336125 [silence]
sw4821B-ms98-a-0031 218.336125 219.640375 um-hum
sw4821B-ms98-a-0032 219.640375 220.733500 yeah
sw4821B-ms98-a-0033 220.733500 222.359250 [silence]
sw4821B-ms98-a-0034 222.359250 228.768125 i'm more interested in trying to understand what's going on in the world rather than simply being aware that
sw4821B-ms98-a-0035 228.768125 232.434750 you know there that an event has [laughter-occurred]
sw4821B-ms98-a-0036 232.434750 239.233625 i i like to stand back and get a slightly bigger picture maybe because i'm easily confused by detail i don't know
sw4821B-ms98-a-0037 239.233625 241.503500 [laughter]
sw4821B-ms98-a-0038 241.503500 242.914875 so
sw4821B-ms98-a-0039 242.914875 256.669000 [silence]
sw4821B-ms98-a-0040 256.669000 259.318750 when you have young children right
sw4821B-ms98-a-0041 259.318750 269.612625 so those evening shows are probably also at a time when you're at liberty to take some time off and be in front of the TV set for awhile without interruption
sw4821B-ms98-a-0042 269.612625 270.782750 [silence]
sw4821B-ms98-a-0043 270.782750 273.098875 oh you do uh-huh
sw4821B-ms98-a-0044 273.098875 277.116625 uh-huh when is your good watching time
sw4821B-ms98-a-0045 277.116625 278.798250 [silence]
sw4821B-ms98-a-0046 278.798250 280.645000 uh-huh yes
sw4821B-ms98-a-0047 280.645000 282.383375 yeah that's what wh[at]-
sw4821B-ms98-a-0048 282.383375 285.006250 [silence]
sw4821B-ms98-a-0049 285.006250 291.512875 i have older children and getting dinner on the table i come from the east coast and i was
sw4821B-ms98-a-0050 291.512875 299.074000 [laughter] it amazed me when i got out here to the midwest and found out that even though they're an hour earlier in time they still watch the news when New Y[ork]-
