sw4830A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.414625 you wanna go first
sw4830A-ms98-a-0002 1.414625 6.154875 okay um one of the things they talked about was uh
sw4830A-ms98-a-0003 6.154875 13.564000 did we di[d]- wha[t]- do what do we think about a judge making the decision and i really don't agree with that
sw4830A-ms98-a-0004 13.564000 17.776500 i think that the trial by jury is better
sw4830A-ms98-a-0005 17.776500 25.720250 uh you know than e[ven]- having a unanimous decision rather than to have one person be responsible
sw4830A-ms98-a-0006 25.720250 31.165500 i don't think that they could be objective in every case every time
sw4830A-ms98-a-0007 31.165500 32.894750 y[ou]- you know what i mean
sw4830A-ms98-a-0008 32.894750 35.448250 [silence]
sw4830A-ms98-a-0009 35.448250 36.745125 yeah
sw4830A-ms98-a-0010 36.745125 41.635625 [silence]
sw4830A-ms98-a-0011 41.635625 42.997000 right
sw4830A-ms98-a-0012 42.997000 48.206875 [silence]
sw4830A-ms98-a-0013 48.206875 49.715500 that's it
sw4830A-ms98-a-0014 49.715500 55.595375 [silence]
sw4830A-ms98-a-0015 55.595375 64.775000 well i- i feel the other thing too uh they were saying uh you know what new ways could you could it you you know change the system
sw4830A-ms98-a-0016 64.775000 76.627000 i- i really think that um we spend a lot of time uh going through appeal after appeal after appeal after appeal i mean i[f]- if you go to a trial by jury
sw4830A-ms98-a-0017 76.627000 89.679125 and especially if a person has confessed if they have been caught you know point blank in the crime there's uh no question it's beyond a reasonable doubt
sw4830A-ms98-a-0018 89.679125 93.912125 you all these things i mean you know we've gone through this uh over and over again
sw4830A-ms98-a-0019 93.912125 101.716125 and it can go on for ten twenty years i- i think this is a little ridiculous
sw4830A-ms98-a-0020 101.716125 106.068500 i think the only people who benefit from that are the lawyers
sw4830A-ms98-a-0021 106.068500 107.388250 [silence]
sw4830A-ms98-a-0022 107.388250 117.313125 i i'm serious and i think that the lawyers have caused a lot of the problems tha[t]- ha[ppen]- that exist in the in the criminal system today with plea bargaining
sw4830A-ms98-a-0023 117.313125 119.604125 you know if someone is [vocalized-noise]
sw4830A-ms98-a-0024 119.604125 121.031125 [silence]
sw4830A-ms98-a-0025 121.031125 122.327875 well
sw4830A-ms98-a-0026 122.327875 125.477750 [silence]
sw4830A-ms98-a-0027 125.477750 132.625250 well i know tha[t's]- that's what i'm saying but i think a lot of all of the whole criminal system is messed up
sw4830A-ms98-a-0028 132.625250 147.475250 in in that regard i mean you know people who commit uh crimes that they i don't know how it works exactly but you know they get lesser sentences and i understand that the jails are full of people you know uh
sw4830A-ms98-a-0029 147.475250 155.588125 and that they have to do something but i think that the reason they are full is because they know that they can get away with it
sw4830A-ms98-a-0030 155.588125 162.328500 you you know what i'm saying tha[t]- we we don't have um well a lot of states don't have capital punishment
sw4830A-ms98-a-0031 162.328500 164.256125 and um
sw4830A-ms98-a-0032 164.256125 176.920000 i- i think they should i and i think if a person is guilty of taking someone's life and like you say it's it's there's no doubt whatsoever like drunk drivers that kill people and um
sw4830A-ms98-a-0033 176.920000 186.309375 you know all they they're caught dead to rights i- i just think that that's they've they've taken a life and if they should pay for it with their life

sw4830A-ms98-a-0051 241.440500 254.312250 imagine the guilt that person would have i mean it burned out is there's no possible way that you could um you know feel good about yourself if you had to do something like that day after day
sw4830A-ms98-a-0052 254.312250 256.922750 no rea[lly]- not really
sw4830A-ms98-a-0053 256.922750 264.879750 [silence]

sw4830A-ms98-a-0055 269.822125 273.771875 [silence]
sw4830A-ms98-a-0056 273.771875 279.971125 i mean supposing i come up to you and i just point blank kill you
sw4830A-ms98-a-0057 279.971125 287.154125 in other words you're saying that we you have to find out whether it's premeditated or what the circumstances were
sw4830A-ms98-a-0058 287.154125 289.113250 [silence]
sw4830A-ms98-a-0059 289.113250 290.439750 yeah
