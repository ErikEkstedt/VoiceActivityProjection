sw4818A-ms98-a-0006 11.357250 13.812875 uh yeah i do have a car
sw4818A-ms98-a-0007 13.812875 23.447000 uh right now i have sort of a sporty car it's a Subaru that i[s]- it's called an XT6 i don't think they make them anymore i think i have the last year
sw4818A-ms98-a-0008 23.447000 30.762625 and it's one of these Japanese cars that run without needing many repairs um
sw4818A-ms98-a-0009 30.762625 43.806375 my advice about cars is uh get a good engine get something that goes not because i'm a speed freak uh something because if you want to get on a highway you don't want to step on the gas and and say come on come [laughter-on]
sw4818A-ms98-a-0010 43.806375 51.758000 i do you know [noise] they make jokes about women picking out the color but i really do like to have a decent [laughter-sized] [laughter-engine] in my car
sw4818A-ms98-a-0011 51.758000 57.863500 and i have a six cylinder and it does go when i tell it to and and i just like the looks of a kind of sporty car
sw4818A-ms98-a-0012 57.863500 65.789500 uh i think my car needs are going to change i had very small children and i was saddled with a station wagon that i never wanted
sw4818A-ms98-a-0013 65.789500 72.559750 um i was told that you know it'll hold groceries and all this stuff well the grocery bags fell over in a station wagon
sw4818A-ms98-a-0014 72.559750 84.695625 you know a[nd]- and you know and i wasn't that thrilled to put a bike in it or a dog in it and i didn't so when i got a new car i got a sporty little car and my kids were still small enough but they weren't in baby seats anymore and they sat in the back
sw4818A-ms98-a-0015 84.695625 91.071750 and now my son is fourteen and a half and he's taller than i am and every time i go over a bump he crashes his head because
sw4818A-ms98-a-0016 91.071750 95.774000 you know these cars have they're backseats but they're kind of toy [laughter-backseats]
sw4818A-ms98-a-0017 95.774000 102.255625 [laughter] so i think should i get another car uh much to my chagrin it'll have to be something more boxy
sw4818A-ms98-a-0018 102.255625 113.480750 and you know practical again so this i g[uess]- i guess this is my reprieve and i guess my suggestion to you is to get something you really enjoy because at some later date you'll have to get something more [laughter-practical]
sw4818A-ms98-a-0019 113.480750 114.890375 [silence]
sw4818A-ms98-a-0020 114.890375 116.814375 [laughter]

sw4818A-ms98-a-0025 146.083500 158.004375 yeah i think so it's you know Toyotas and all those they['re]- they're nice cars but you know surely there's an American car i i'd love to check out the Saturn which is supposed to be a new newly made American car
sw4818A-ms98-a-0026 158.004375 181.694000 [silence]

sw4818A-ms98-a-0040 232.155750 236.403250 is it because_1 they're so cute the Geo Storm is adorable 
sw4818A-ms98-a-0041 236.403250 239.163375 [silence]
sw4818A-ms98-a-0042 239.163375 248.471625 no no i don't in fact i i sat in one a long time ago and slammed the car door and it felt a little tinny you know it wa[s]- it's a smaller lighter car
sw4818A-ms98-a-0043 248.471625 259.191875 but you know that was years ago that was about four years ago when i bought mine so it may have changed i know on looks i think the Storm is just adorable little car for a single person
sw4818A-ms98-a-0044 259.191875 260.706000 [silence]
sw4818A-ms98-a-0045 260.706000 263.909375 hm are are you working yet

sw4818A-ms98-a-0047 266.480000 268.088875 uh-huh
sw4818A-ms98-a-0048 268.088875 270.940125 yeah because_1 i was wondering if you're are you going to finance it
sw4818A-ms98-a-0049 270.940125 272.138250 [silence]
sw4818A-ms98-a-0050 272.138250 273.193875 right
sw4818A-ms98-a-0051 273.193875 274.262375 [silence]
sw4818A-ms98-a-0052 274.262375 282.416875 uh well i have been fortunate enough to be able to just pay for it and i i like to do that but there are people who can pay for it who prefer to finance it
sw4818A-ms98-a-0053 282.416875 291.677750 yeah i[t]- it seems to me as you're paying interest you're bound to be end up paying more i guess now you have to think about uh if the money in the bank will get more interest
sw4818A-ms98-a-0054 291.677750 299.938000 uh then then you'll want to finance it but if now the banks are giving so little interest i imagine you might as well just pay for it if you could
