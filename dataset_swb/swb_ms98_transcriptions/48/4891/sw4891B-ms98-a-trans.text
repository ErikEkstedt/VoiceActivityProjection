sw4891B-ms98-a-0009 30.415000 37.536500 as far as sitting down and putting a formal budget paper and pen you know and following it no we don't do that

sw4891B-ms98-a-0021 97.529000 108.925500 that's right well it's very difficult my husband is i[n]- is self-employed he's in uh financial planning and and so all of his income is commissions
sw4891B-ms98-a-0022 108.925500 119.432625 it's very hard to sit down and budget because you don't know what he's going to make uh you know we kind of think you know he usually brings home at least this much and i can base you know base it from there
sw4891B-ms98-a-0023 119.432625 133.308500 but there's months that he brings home uh you know three times that much and there's some months he doesn't bring home anything it just depends on where the commissions fall and so you kind of have to you know i ha[ve]- in in my mind i know the basics i know what we've got to meet each month
sw4891B-ms98-a-0024 133.308500 138.802000 you know and and my salary helps towards that because mine's set you know but um
sw4891B-ms98-a-0025 138.802000 148.749250 i think that we could probably save a little better or afford to do more things for fun that we'd like to do if i did follow a [noise] you know pencil and paper budget but
sw4891B-ms98-a-0026 148.749250 150.079125 [silence]

sw4891B-ms98-a-0041 241.059500 249.871500 and i'm glad he ha[s]- i mean it's his release it's his time each week where he's not dad and he's not husband and he's not employee and he you know what i'm saying it's just a release
sw4891B-ms98-a-0042 249.871500 258.979875 and no dad [laughter] dad [laughter] not dead [laughter] i'll have to work on that uh
sw4891B-ms98-a-0043 258.979875 266.612625 and and i'm glad he has that i'm glad he enjoys it but i used to resent it because i felt like all of our spare money went to his golf [noise]
sw4891B-ms98-a-0044 266.612625 272.686750 i don't particularly have anything i like to do from week to week or day to day or or anything like that and that's fine
sw4891B-ms98-a-0045 272.686750 280.768875 um and so what i started doing and he's never said you know if i wanted something i'd look in the checkbook because i'm to practical and say nah i'd better not spend the money
sw4891B-ms98-a-0046 280.768875 285.248625 well he's never held me back you know he's always said if you want something go get it
sw4891B-ms98-a-0047 285.248625 296.316375 but i didn't feel comfortable so now when he goes and golfs i take you know if he takes out ten bucks or fifteen bucks or twenty bucks i take the same amount and i stick it in a savings account that i have at the credit union at work
sw4891B-ms98-a-0048 296.316375 298.466000 and i save for something i want becau[se]-
