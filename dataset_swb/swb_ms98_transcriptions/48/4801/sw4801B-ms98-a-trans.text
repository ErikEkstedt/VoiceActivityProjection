sw4801B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.905750 [noise]
sw4801B-ms98-a-0002 1.905750 6.042625 well i'm kind of in favor of it for certain crimes
sw4801B-ms98-a-0003 6.042625 7.578750 [silence]
sw4801B-ms98-a-0004 7.578750 9.044750 well
sw4801B-ms98-a-0005 9.044750 12.836125 i think first degree murder um
sw4801B-ms98-a-0006 12.836125 15.464375 probably warrants it
sw4801B-ms98-a-0007 15.464375 19.548875 [silence]
sw4801B-ms98-a-0008 19.548875 20.949750 right
sw4801B-ms98-a-0009 20.949750 22.276875 [silence]
sw4801B-ms98-a-0010 22.276875 27.929125 exactly recurrent crimes like serial rapists or serial murderers or whatever
sw4801B-ms98-a-0011 27.929125 33.350625 i come from a state that has well i originally come from a state that has uh
sw4801B-ms98-a-0012 33.350625 43.672500 the death penalty i come from Florida and uh they're pretty liberal on it they tend to like fry people left and right which go ahead
sw4801B-ms98-a-0013 43.672500 50.487375 [silence]
sw4801B-ms98-a-0014 50.487375 51.788125 yeah
sw4801B-ms98-a-0015 51.788125 56.474875 [silence]
sw4801B-ms98-a-0016 56.474875 60.356750 yeah okay i think Florida still uses electric chair
sw4801B-ms98-a-0017 60.356750 65.693625 um i don't i don't know in some ways i don't like it because it's like you're playing God
sw4801B-ms98-a-0018 65.693625 74.179875 and that's not you know i don't think that's right but on the other hand there's a lot of advantages to it i think crime rates deterred a little bit by using it
sw4801B-ms98-a-0019 74.179875 80.591625 and of course you have some savings in terms of taxpayer money keeping people in jail or not
sw4801B-ms98-a-0020 80.591625 87.202625 um with Florida that's a big problem because there's so many people in jail that they have to let them_1 out every year they
sw4801B-ms98-a-0021 87.202625 92.965750 [silence]
sw4801B-ms98-a-0022 92.965750 94.297875 um-hum
sw4801B-ms98-a-0023 94.297875 99.840125 [silence]
sw4801B-ms98-a-0024 99.840125 108.374375 sure and it's like you know that's a big problem but there's not a whole lot you can do about it because there's only so many jails you can build
sw4801B-ms98-a-0025 108.374375 113.237875 and it's really you know it's it gets to be a a rea[lly]- a big problem
sw4801B-ms98-a-0026 113.237875 115.187250 um go ahead
sw4801B-ms98-a-0027 115.187250 121.628500 [silence]
sw4801B-ms98-a-0028 121.628500 122.938000 right
sw4801B-ms98-a-0029 122.938000 125.607875 [silence]
sw4801B-ms98-a-0030 125.607875 131.500125 um-hum yeah because_1 a lot of these guys you know they get in and they they get off for good behavior
sw4801B-ms98-a-0031 131.500125 141.035125 and i don't know i mean up in Minnesota where i am now they don't have the death penalty and you can almost sense that people are just laughing at the system
sw4801B-ms98-a-0032 141.035125 149.134125 you know because they figure well you know sure i- i get thirty or forty years for maybe rape or something um
sw4801B-ms98-a-0033 149.134125 154.922875 but then for if i if i elicit good behavior i'm out in maybe five or ten
sw4801B-ms98-a-0034 154.922875 165.445375 oh sure you know i mean just because like we said before they don't have enough room in the jails um you know there's a lot of incentive for them to be let out early
sw4801B-ms98-a-0035 165.445375 170.040250 but if you've got the death penalty hanging over your head um
sw4801B-ms98-a-0036 170.040250 174.211500 i don't know i think that may solve a lot of that maybe not solve it but
sw4801B-ms98-a-0037 174.211500 177.262625 i don't know maybe even help a little bit
sw4801B-ms98-a-0038 177.262625 181.732125 [silence]

sw4801B-ms98-a-0049 207.269250 215.219500 i don't know it's it's an interesting issue there's like you say in Texas there's been quite a few and and in Florida in the last few years
sw4801B-ms98-a-0050 215.219500 221.402250 i think there's been a lot i can't i [vocalized-noise] i mean i can't give you figures but um
