sw4801A-ms98-a-0025 86.096875 96.018000 yeah that's what's happening here there is like um that's in fact a big gubernatorial issue is the the turn over rates of
sw4801A-ms98-a-0026 96.018000 102.179250 um re[peat]- uh repeat offenders being let out and doing it again

sw4801A-ms98-a-0031 113.850250 126.535250 i wish if th[ey]- if they were gonna do it they would be a little more consistent in dealing with who gets lethal injection and who doesn't be a little more you know not being able to put it off for fifteen years
sw4801A-ms98-a-0032 126.535250 154.397625 [silence]

sw4801A-ms98-a-0042 174.870375 184.429500 i yeah i tend to think the repeal system for the death penalty is a little little too lenient um kind of takes away
sw4801A-ms98-a-0043 184.429500 187.881500 from the significance of the death penalty
sw4801A-ms98-a-0044 187.881500 189.263625 [silence]
sw4801A-ms98-a-0045 189.263625 193.806625 i'm a graduate student at the University of Texas in Dallas
sw4801A-ms98-a-0046 193.806625 196.610875 um Audiology

sw4801A-ms98-a-0053 219.535875 220.919625 yeah
sw4801A-ms98-a-0054 220.919625 226.283375 i just an[d]- this was in conjunction with a guy that was put in the gas chamber [noise]
sw4801A-ms98-a-0055 226.283375 234.327250 in California so i- i think it the forty sixth in last twenty five years i think it's what they gave a run down that Texas
sw4801A-ms98-a-0056 234.327250 239.701875 Texas tends to be a little more robust and disciplined area then
sw4801A-ms98-a-0057 239.701875 243.027125 [silence]
sw4801A-ms98-a-0058 243.027125 248.441875 yeah um they they don't get repealed as easily as they do
sw4801A-ms98-a-0059 248.441875 260.434250 like i[n]- the guy in California got thir[d]- you know twice before he went to the gas chamber and then they said okay no you don't have to go and then they took him back i mean it just seems
sw4801A-ms98-a-0060 260.434250 266.676625 yeah it just seemed a little inconsistent and then you had like who you have
sw4801A-ms98-a-0061 266.676625 273.543750 these people who are serial killers that didn't even get the death sentence back whenever you know
sw4801A-ms98-a-0062 273.543750 284.054250 [silence]
sw4801A-ms98-a-0063 284.054250 290.626000 no i don['t]- i don't think um the military doesn't execute anymore so
sw4801A-ms98-a-0064 290.626000 293.985625 or death before the firing squad or whatever
sw4801A-ms98-a-0065 293.985625 297.197750 so i think about the only one is um
sw4801A-ms98-a-0066 297.197750 298.562000 rape
