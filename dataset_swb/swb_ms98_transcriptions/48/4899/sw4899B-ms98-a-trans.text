sw4899B-ms98-a-0002 1.009250 5.681750 [silence]
sw4899B-ms98-a-0003 5.681750 8.283875 [laughter]
sw4899B-ms98-a-0004 8.283875 36.304625 [silence]
sw4899B-ms98-a-0005 36.304625 38.320000 yeah well
sw4899B-ms98-a-0006 38.320000 48.724875 i oh i'll say this first i'm certainly for conversion to the metric system unfortunately i'm not sure how well grounded my uh feelings for that are maybe it's 
sw4899B-ms98-a-0007 48.724875 57.808125 just because it's a highly regular system and you don't have to worry about whether something is five thousand two hundred and eighty units or or
sw4899B-ms98-a-0008 57.808125 64.996375 i'm just going to walk over here and stop my cats from doing what they're doing um and the metric system is you know
sw4899B-ms98-a-0009 64.996375 78.993000 you it has so many different prefixes like autometer and femtometer and stuff like that you don't need them just use the you know the meter the kilometer you know whatever it's i don't know that that's i think that's its primary uh 
sw4899B-ms98-a-0010 78.993000 79.996625 [silence]
sw4899B-ms98-a-0011 79.996625 82.421750 primary uh use is that
sw4899B-ms98-a-0012 82.421750 95.996750 and of course in scientific uses uh things like the like a mile uh or i'm not s[ure]- a pound uh have have some use whenever you try to uh combine them into formula then you have to
sw4899B-ms98-a-0013 95.996750 103.494250 uh have conversion constants and things like that so most most of the formulas although they are are some that uh don't obey this rule 
sw4899B-ms98-a-0014 103.494250 111.687500 most scientific formulas can be adapted with the metric system because of the way things are interrelated that you'll need those extra conversion constants
sw4899B-ms98-a-0015 111.687500 119.498750 like a cubic let's see what is it a cubic centimeter of water is also a gram of water at standard temperature and pressure
sw4899B-ms98-a-0016 119.498750 132.009375 [silence]
sw4899B-ms98-a-0017 132.009375 133.732500 um-hum
sw4899B-ms98-a-0018 133.732500 140.472125 [silence]
sw4899B-ms98-a-0019 140.472125 141.976250 right
sw4899B-ms98-a-0020 141.976250 161.028875 [silence]
sw4899B-ms98-a-0021 161.028875 162.775000 right
sw4899B-ms98-a-0022 162.775000 167.477000 [silence]
sw4899B-ms98-a-0023 167.477000 169.972250 yeah that's true
sw4899B-ms98-a-0024 169.972250 179.989500 [silence]
sw4899B-ms98-a-0025 179.989500 181.776375 [laughter]
sw4899B-ms98-a-0026 181.776375 183.994875 [silence]
sw4899B-ms98-a-0027 183.994875 193.103375 well it it happens first well it i guess it happens first in either of the two places i guess either in the school or just products
sw4899B-ms98-a-0028 193.103375 200.233375 uh one thing about uh a lot of US products i'm just looking at something here shaving cream that is not in this case
sw4899B-ms98-a-0029 200.233375 209.282375 uh list both what they are in the English or British Imperial System whatever it's called units uh and the metric system units so this just says seven ounces
sw4899B-ms98-a-0030 209.282375 219.620250 uh i- i think i've heard that in Canada what they did was primarily they didn't change the size the sizes that various products came in they just changed the way they were annotated
sw4899B-ms98-a-0031 219.620250 229.182000 so something before was you know w[as]- and see you have things in odd measurements that's even true like for film and like you know sixteen millimeter and thirty five millimeter film 
sw4899B-ms98-a-0032 229.182000 236.499500 those odd things come about i'm not sure exactly what they are because it's like a half inch or whatever they just 
sw4899B-ms98-a-0033 236.499500 240.168500 you know they say okay milli[meter]- this is a European thing too
sw4899B-ms98-a-0034 240.168500 252.795625 so uh we'll just used to keep using the standard size but we'll just call it something else so you have odd things like sixteen millimeter and thirty five millimeter where originated in the metric system it'll probably be something regular but i guess that's that's not too [noise]
sw4899B-ms98-a-0035 252.795625 262.781375 not too important but i think uh at least in northern or northeastern schools uh they people are relatively uh well inducted into the metric system
sw4899B-ms98-a-0036 262.781375 269.982500 anyone who takes you know chemistry physics anything like that in school i think in most cases it's done in in metric system it was for me
sw4899B-ms98-a-0037 269.982500 283.990250 [silence]
sw4899B-ms98-a-0038 283.990250 288.700625 [laughter-yeah] when you tell somebody liters bottles of Coke yeah 
sw4899B-ms98-a-0039 288.700625 291.484125 that's true that is and oddity
sw4899B-ms98-a-0040 291.484125 298.850000 [silence]
