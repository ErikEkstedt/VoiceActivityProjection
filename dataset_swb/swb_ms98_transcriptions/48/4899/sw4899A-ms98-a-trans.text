sw4899A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 7.372125 [noise] -[o]pinion on whether we need to change to the metric system is that i don't think that i have an opinion one way or the other 
sw4899A-ms98-a-0002 7.372125 21.283875 i kind of feel that there are more important issues to be dealt with than worrying about the metric system and i think the reason it failed last time is that most people really just didn't see any real benefit in changing
sw4899A-ms98-a-0003 21.283875 25.214875 so i guess if we were to go about making the change
sw4899A-ms98-a-0004 25.214875 37.488500 you would have to really demonstrate to people that there is some legitimate reason to make the change that would directly benefit them otherwise we're never going to really see any change
sw4899A-ms98-a-0005 37.488500 43.256250 [silence]
sw4899A-ms98-a-0006 43.256250 44.746375 um-hum
sw4899A-ms98-a-0007 44.746375 56.043625 [silence]
sw4899A-ms98-a-0008 56.043625 57.731250 yeah
sw4899A-ms98-a-0009 57.731250 60.229625 [silence]
sw4899A-ms98-a-0010 60.229625 61.491250 hum
sw4899A-ms98-a-0011 61.491250 74.215750 [silence]
sw4899A-ms98-a-0012 74.215750 75.492875 yeah

sw4899A-ms98-a-0016 116.705000 118.197250 um-hum
sw4899A-ms98-a-0017 118.197250 126.255000 well whenever the Canadians changed we're since we're very close to the Canadian border here we kind of observed things when they made their change
sw4899A-ms98-a-0018 126.255000 133.924250 and they were able to convert a little more readily although most people up there still would talk in terms of fahrenheit instead of Celsius
sw4899A-ms98-a-0019 133.924250 141.376250 uh even though they try to get you to use the Celsius system it it went a little easier because Canada is so influenced by Britain
sw4899A-ms98-a-0020 141.376250 151.488375 and a lot of the products and services that they were either dealing with or receiving on their end were really equipped for the metric system
sw4899A-ms98-a-0021 151.488375 162.026625 and uh it was a easier change and they saw some direct benefit because they didn't have to pour the extra income in to making special products just for the [noise] older system 
sw4899A-ms98-a-0022 162.026625 168.785000 but um you know in in this country you have really stubborn people [laughter]
sw4899A-ms98-a-0023 168.785000 177.756750 who i don't think are going to especially you know they may do it in the more in the big city centers or in certain round uh manufacturing industries
sw4899A-ms98-a-0024 177.756750 185.988125 but the average person in Raleigh Missouri i don't think [laughter-is] going to what was this celsius stuff you know i don't

sw4899A-ms98-a-0039 268.986000 277.558375 i learned metrics you know in high school and and before that so i'm familiar with the system i'm still using inches and pounds and the like
sw4899A-ms98-a-0040 277.558375 287.195750 i the only thing we as Americans have become accustomed to as far as the metric system is now we buy two liter bottles of Coke you [laughter-know] [laughter] 
sw4899A-ms98-a-0041 287.195750 290.221375 [laughter]
sw4899A-ms98-a-0042 290.221375 298.850000 i mean it sounds you know a gallon sounds like that's too much but two liters and and you know doesn't sound as bad as three quarts or [laughter]
