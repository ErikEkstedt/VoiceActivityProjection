sw4832B-ms98-a-0035 174.385875 184.414875 company i work for is bi[g]- big enough that they can that that they've got clout but i you know feel guilty and resent a little bit the fact that that [noise] 
sw4832B-ms98-a-0036 184.414875 197.969875 for instance y[ou]- people like your father that just leaves them worse off cause the the health care providers end up making up w[hat]- what uh my employer doesn't pay them_1 uh by charging more for uh
sw4832B-ms98-a-0037 197.969875 204.734000 other people you know so that that that doesn't seem to me to be a fair thing either and uh from

sw4832B-ms98-a-0039 205.745875 212.914750 from what i hear Canada has a -[h]as a really a a pretty good system in terms of of universal government health
sw4832B-ms98-a-0040 212.914750 224.330250 uh insurance depending on who you listen to why there may or may not be longer waits than here for some elective surgeries but but uh
sw4832B-ms98-a-0041 224.330250 233.404875 in terms of the per person health care that they spend it's it's on the order of half as much uh
sw4832B-ms98-a-0042 233.404875 246.548500 as the as the per capita average in the United States i think and and very nearly comparable service and i you know [vocalized-noise] i'm i'm willing to accept some [vocalized-noise] some limits in terms of [noise]
sw4832B-ms98-a-0043 246.548500 259.238875 [noise] i think it's Oregon that just gone through a uh passed a state uh health insurance scheme where they had a commission draw up a very uh
sw4832B-ms98-a-0044 259.238875 271.332250 you know very detailed and stringent priority list of what uh of of the uh different procedures and the and their costs
sw4832B-ms98-a-0045 271.332250 284.349000 and prioritized in terms of the of the cost effectiveness and then just went down the list and said okay here's the cutoff point uh if if you're below this point then it the the odds of it doing you 
sw4832B-ms98-a-0046 284.349000 297.858000 any good versus the costs are just not enough to be um effective and we'll uh we won't pay for those things and uh you know i'm i'm not
