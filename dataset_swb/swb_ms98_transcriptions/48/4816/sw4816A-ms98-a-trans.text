sw4816A-ms98-a-0004 5.399125 17.987500 [noise] i'll tell you i am uh uh impressed with the uh uh amount of spending that's occurred so far as as far as AIDS research and i think that uh proportionately 
sw4816A-ms98-a-0005 17.987500 23.402625 maybe uh so far it's been enough it seems like it seems like uh
sw4816A-ms98-a-0006 23.402625 31.710875 but there's not [noise] uh been any money taken away from uh other necessary medical research uh

sw4816A-ms98-a-0008 35.154750 46.366375 you know and and allocated towards the AIDS research i think that AIDS research has been a a a lot of the funding has not been done by the government a lot of it has been done by private endowment
sw4816A-ms98-a-0009 46.366375 50.426875 uh but i think the government is doing a good job so far
sw4816A-ms98-a-0010 50.426875 53.899000 of keeping the uh their portion of the funding up

sw4816A-ms98-a-0029 172.504125 178.252375 you know who suggested that maybe maybe we [vocalized-noise] you know maybe that is a a possible and and uh
sw4816A-ms98-a-0030 178.252375 190.137875 uh likely most effective solution is you know abstinence and and yet the a large portion of the community said well that's stupid you know that just shows that you have no interest in in in spending any money on the on the problem and i thought
