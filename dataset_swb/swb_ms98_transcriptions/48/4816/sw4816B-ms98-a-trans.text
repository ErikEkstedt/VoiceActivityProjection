sw4816B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.415250 [noise]
sw4816B-ms98-a-0002 1.415250 5.140000 well you called here [laughter-so]
sw4816B-ms98-a-0003 5.140000 52.579500 [silence]
sw4816B-ms98-a-0004 52.579500 60.642750 well i um i agree to an extent um i think the problem is is that
sw4816B-ms98-a-0005 60.642750 69.717375 we're spending money and one of the things that the government likes to do when they're under public pressure is to throw money at the problem
sw4816B-ms98-a-0006 69.717375 83.675125 in an attempt to try and solve it as quickly as possible and they did that with the Pentagon in the eighties [laughter] and when you have a lot of money in your budget and you don't wanna have it cut back you spend it even if it means throwing it away
sw4816B-ms98-a-0007 83.675125 97.510000 and i think that while we need to spend more effort and money on things like education and maybe even alternative treatments and alternative ex[periments]- things to keep those afflicted alive at this point
sw4816B-ms98-a-0008 97.510000 104.987500 i think that any money that is given must be given carefully just to something that is a proven point not just thrown at it
sw4816B-ms98-a-0009 104.987500 111.665500 um i- i don't see that the money is being removed from any other causes um
sw4816B-ms98-a-0010 111.665500 115.650500 AIDS has been a problem though especially in the eighties
sw4816B-ms98-a-0011 115.650500 121.087750 when there wasn't a lot of private dollars around because of the stigma of the disease
sw4816B-ms98-a-0012 121.087750 127.543875 and that people really didn't groups didn't wanna be associated with it because it was a morals issue
sw4816B-ms98-a-0013 127.543875 135.647750 i think we're finally getting over that i thought that was ridiculous reading and hearing about that kind of moral dilemma stuff but [noise]
sw4816B-ms98-a-0014 135.647750 142.798500 i think that it we need to spend a lot more on education and try and get over this thing that we have about
sw4816B-ms98-a-0015 142.798500 151.896125 not confronting this head on with some factual advertising for items of condoms and things like that that
sw4816B-ms98-a-0016 151.896125 161.977000 will help prevent the uh disease as well as instilling the notion that the best way not to get it is not to involve yourselves in unsafe practices in the first place [laughter]
sw4816B-ms98-a-0017 161.977000 191.869750 [silence]
sw4816B-ms98-a-0018 191.869750 198.460500 well the the problem is that with this administration at least when they say abstinence
sw4816B-ms98-a-0019 198.460500 204.210250 they often couch that in other things that turn into one of these morals issues
sw4816B-ms98-a-0020 204.210250 214.948375 which uh makes it turn into a political issue now you see the problem is you have people in the National Institutes of Health in Atlanta and the like the Centers for Disease Control which
sw4816B-ms98-a-0021 214.948375 220.380375 have fundamentalists in charge of the thing who won't even let you say condom in a meeting
sw4816B-ms98-a-0022 220.380375 228.151375 and these things have been spread around and i[mmediately]- immediately people think well abstinence okay here we have these religious zealots telling us
sw4816B-ms98-a-0023 228.151375 238.964000 where they're trying to ignore the problem blah blah blah and of course they overreact when you say that the fact that it's just good medical safe practice you know don't expose yourself in the first place
sw4816B-ms98-a-0024 238.964000 253.414000 but the it's because th[e]- th[e]- the you know this administration was around when Reagan when the disease first was discovered here and all the social you know implications of the Reagan administration ignoring it when it first became an issue and 
sw4816B-ms98-a-0025 253.414000 255.408375 see that's all carrying over now
sw4816B-ms98-a-0026 255.408375 257.954750 and that's why you're seeing that
sw4816B-ms98-a-0027 257.954750 259.871000 [noise]
sw4816B-ms98-a-0028 259.871000 268.875750 [silence]
sw4816B-ms98-a-0029 268.875750 274.632875 yeah there is because what happened is a lot of these people and staff members are political appointees
sw4816B-ms98-a-0030 274.632875 280.632500 from the south especially who come along with a variety of different religious beliefs
sw4816B-ms98-a-0031 280.632500 283.241125 some of which held very fervent beliefs
sw4816B-ms98-a-0032 283.241125 294.265750 and will take their beliefs into the workplace in and in this case a lot of people consider that to be standing in the way of science and medicine to try and solve this thing
sw4816B-ms98-a-0033 294.265750 298.178000 but i i don't like throwing money at the problem uh bec[ause]-
