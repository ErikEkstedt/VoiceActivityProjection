sw4814A-ms98-a-0011 46.038750 54.074125 yeah i think mainly because i haven't been watching what's politically going on um in that a[t]- you know
sw4814A-ms98-a-0012 54.074125 68.041125 in that aspect uh as far as like now the new health bill that went through Minnesota uh being that it is their neighboring state and that i lived in Minnesota and more familiar with the politics that involved with that and that being passed
sw4814A-ms98-a-0013 68.041125 73.609125 but um as far as politics in the grander uh
sw4814A-ms98-a-0014 73.609125 81.995625 part of it as if you want to look at uh election type things i'm not quite sure even if i'm going to vote uh
sw4814A-ms98-a-0015 81.995625 90.810875 i[t]- it gets harder and harder each time an election comes up like that to make the decision on who would be the best to run um
sw4814A-ms98-a-0016 90.810875 94.382375 [silence]
sw4814A-ms98-a-0017 94.382375 95.697375 um-hum
sw4814A-ms98-a-0018 95.697375 97.654875 [silence]
sw4814A-ms98-a-0019 97.654875 98.962500 sure
sw4814A-ms98-a-0020 98.962500 103.915500 [silence]
sw4814A-ms98-a-0021 103.915500 105.604375 exactly
sw4814A-ms98-a-0022 105.604375 110.651625 [silence]
sw4814A-ms98-a-0023 110.651625 111.974250 um-hum
sw4814A-ms98-a-0024 111.974250 118.146250 [silence]

sw4814A-ms98-a-0026 119.348375 130.283875 [silence]
sw4814A-ms98-a-0027 130.283875 132.278750 um-hum sure
sw4814A-ms98-a-0028 132.278750 148.562125 [silence]
sw4814A-ms98-a-0029 148.562125 156.766375 he might be a a one of those sure uh it it's kind of when you think back of the old politics where a dirt farmer
sw4814A-ms98-a-0030 156.766375 167.547500 uh when you think of some of the best presidents we've had in the past have been people that have struggled to get to the top i mean they were not rich in in any means
sw4814A-ms98-a-0031 167.547500 179.328250 and it has been kind of in the past uh i don't know maybe fifty years that in order for a person to get i[nvolved]- involved with politics they've had to have money
sw4814A-ms98-a-0032 179.328250 186.803500 and you had to have the views of the people that were going to be paying your way um
sw4814A-ms98-a-0033 186.803500 198.927250 so it makes the common person uh not to say that a common person couldn't run for government and do a a fabulous job because he's got people that are quite intelligent and
sw4814A-ms98-a-0034 198.927250 207.499625 i don't know if we'll ever see that you know where a common person could ever get in there that has good moral standings and uh has
sw4814A-ms98-a-0035 207.499625 218.038875 um you know you think of Abraham [linking/Lincoln] Lincoln and you know just th[e]- the background of Abraham Lincoln you know teaching himself to read he didn't go to college he didn't
sw4814A-ms98-a-0036 218.038875 230.306000 you know do all the other things that um you know you would think that was real popular to do and to get po[litically]- politically involved and and have money he didn't come from money um
sw4814A-ms98-a-0037 230.306000 232.078125 and now it it
sw4814A-ms98-a-0038 232.078125 238.695500 [silence]
sw4814A-ms98-a-0039 238.695500 240.440000 um-hum sure

sw4814A-ms98-a-0045 257.621875 260.405375 so you really know a lot of his background
sw4814A-ms98-a-0046 260.405375 263.434125 [silence]
sw4814A-ms98-a-0047 263.434125 275.191500 it was the big one it's the one that everybody wants yeah whether or not uh you know you look at all these candidates that want to become President i really have to ask them why you know um
sw4814A-ms98-a-0048 275.191500 288.714875 it's the toughest job in the world to do and not only that you don't have that much freedom to make choices i mean you have to go through so many different you got to go through the House the Congress and all of the a other things to get a bill passed
sw4814A-ms98-a-0049 288.714875 299.394000 and sure you can veto uh veto it at the last minute but then it's not like you have all that power and i think along time ago Presidents did have a lot of power and i think we're
