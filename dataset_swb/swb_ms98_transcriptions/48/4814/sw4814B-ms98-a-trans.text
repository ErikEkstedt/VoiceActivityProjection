sw4814B-ms98-a-0002 0.688625 4.167750 so interesting political trends or events huh
sw4814B-ms98-a-0003 4.167750 14.396250 [laughter-well] i guess the uh most interesting one that's uh going on right now from my perspective is this uh phenomena of um [noise] uh Ross Perot
sw4814B-ms98-a-0004 14.396250 26.799000 uh caught his interview last night with David Frost and it was the the first time i had you know heard um you know his views expressed by himself i had heard other people talk about what they thought he believed in
sw4814B-ms98-a-0005 26.799000 36.436875 but the whole phenomena of him coming out of uh literally no where no party um at least no apparent party support on either side
sw4814B-ms98-a-0006 36.436875 38.417000 [noise] is pretty interesting
sw4814B-ms98-a-0007 38.417000 41.670875 [silence]
sw4814B-ms98-a-0008 41.670875 43.058375 um-hum
sw4814B-ms98-a-0009 43.058375 44.990125 [silence]
sw4814B-ms98-a-0010 44.990125 47.067375 like out of nowhere yeah
sw4814B-ms98-a-0011 47.067375 50.986500 [silence]
sw4814B-ms98-a-0012 50.986500 52.444000 um-hum

sw4814B-ms98-a-0016 80.570375 82.819875 [laughter-um-hum] yeah
sw4814B-ms98-a-0017 82.819875 89.526250 [silence]
sw4814B-ms98-a-0018 89.526250 90.976000 um-hum
sw4814B-ms98-a-0019 90.976000 104.518750 [noise] well it seems that the decisions so far has been filtered by uh you know party politics so much that when the candidates finally get party approval party support and therefore get presented to the public
sw4814B-ms98-a-0020 104.518750 111.240500 the the candidates are already beyond what uh most public uh feels is acceptable behavior
sw4814B-ms98-a-0021 111.240500 123.909375 you know the one of the common criticisms of Clinton is uh gee he'll say or do anything in order to get to the White House and and up unto the point of uh Perot being a serious candidate it seems like that
sw4814B-ms98-a-0022 123.909375 130.860750 that was a requirement of being a a contender within the party is is to have done all those things
sw4814B-ms98-a-0023 130.860750 139.836625 i mean here's a here's a guy who for twenty years has been working toward you know getting the party nomination and and preparing himself for the presidency
sw4814B-ms98-a-0024 139.836625 148.134250 and now it seems like both he and the incumbent President are you know pretty seriously threatened by somebody who comes out of
sw4814B-ms98-a-0025 148.134250 151.093250 a whole nonpolitical arena
sw4814B-ms98-a-0026 151.093250 165.580875 [silence]

sw4814B-ms98-a-0036 230.245000 243.756000 a[nd]- and yet even he was a a consummate politician in the sense that uh not only did he f[ail]- uh fail in business twice with bankruptcy and and failure but he lost some eighteen elections before he finally won one
sw4814B-ms98-a-0037 243.756000 249.213875 and the first e[lection]- first and only election he won was um the presidency
sw4814B-ms98-a-0038 249.213875 258.972750 [laughter] [laughter-he] [laughter-he] [laughter-had] lost every other office that he had you know he was appointed a couple of times to uh like uh [noise] uh state legislator
sw4814B-ms98-a-0039 258.972750 266.077250 [laughter-yeah] then when then when he finally you know did win an election uh you know was the presidency yeah
