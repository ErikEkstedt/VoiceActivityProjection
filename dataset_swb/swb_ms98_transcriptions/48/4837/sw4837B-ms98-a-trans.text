sw4837B-ms98-a-0002 2.254625 8.950875 um well i think uh there's been significant change over the last couple of decades uh
sw4837B-ms98-a-0003 8.950875 15.051000 i guess i would say that one of the most um important changes seems to be
sw4837B-ms98-a-0004 15.051000 16.270125 um
sw4837B-ms98-a-0005 16.270125 21.353875 that the family the definition of family is changing a lot
sw4837B-ms98-a-0006 21.353875 26.244875 [silence]
sw4837B-ms98-a-0007 26.244875 27.372250 right
sw4837B-ms98-a-0008 27.372250 34.027750 [silence]
sw4837B-ms98-a-0009 34.027750 35.065750 right
sw4837B-ms98-a-0010 35.065750 44.958125 [silence]
sw4837B-ms98-a-0011 44.958125 45.901125 right
sw4837B-ms98-a-0012 45.901125 51.151875 [silence]
sw4837B-ms98-a-0013 51.151875 52.702375 yeah exactly
sw4837B-ms98-a-0014 52.702375 56.038375 [silence]
sw4837B-ms98-a-0015 56.038375 68.168500 it seems to me it seems to me like um like everyone is lamenting you know the loss of the nuclear family and saying that it's going to be the downfall of America but to me um
sw4837B-ms98-a-0016 68.168500 78.655375 i don't know i guess that that's that's probably a pretty [laughter-liberal] view but i mean to me the the old um traditional nuclear family um
sw4837B-ms98-a-0017 78.655375 91.095000 seems to only wo[rk]- seems to work real well uh you know when uh husband is in charge of the family when he's working when mom's home taking care of the kids
sw4837B-ms98-a-0018 91.095000 96.813125 and you know as soon as mom gets equal rights and she can work too
sw4837B-ms98-a-0019 96.813125 104.107875 then all of the sudden you know there's all these constraints on the family i mean face it it's basically
sw4837B-ms98-a-0020 104.107875 111.402625 an old um you know religious construction so um it's it's
sw4837B-ms98-a-0021 111.402625 112.765750 [silence]
sw4837B-ms98-a-0022 112.765750 119.447125 no i- i actually i actually think um it's it's better the way it's working out i- i think
sw4837B-ms98-a-0023 119.447125 128.411875 i think that when each person is is working that uh it makes for mo[re]- it makes for like two dependent people
sw4837B-ms98-a-0024 128.411875 137.961750 and two independent people who are sharing their lives rather than one person dependent on another person seems to me uh
sw4837B-ms98-a-0025 137.961750 149.779500 [silence]
sw4837B-ms98-a-0026 149.779500 150.754375 uh-huh

sw4837B-ms98-a-0030 165.169500 167.239750 yeah it just seems that way
sw4837B-ms98-a-0031 167.239750 178.988250 [silence]
sw4837B-ms98-a-0032 178.988250 180.276125 exactly
sw4837B-ms98-a-0033 180.276125 183.149250 [silence]
sw4837B-ms98-a-0034 183.149250 186.347000 see i came from um a pretty conservative family too
sw4837B-ms98-a-0035 186.347000 195.005875 but the uh thing is that it didn't work out and my parent's split up so maybe that's what [laughter] yeah maybe that's what um influenced my view
sw4837B-ms98-a-0036 195.005875 196.878750 [silence]
sw4837B-ms98-a-0037 196.878750 197.725250 right

sw4837B-ms98-a-0044 219.998750 228.518000 of course of course when both um parents are working the big question is you know who how how do the kids get raised
sw4837B-ms98-a-0045 228.518000 236.872375 [silence]

sw4837B-ms98-a-0050 248.803000 254.195625 one system that um is interesting that that w[e]- we may take in
sw4837B-ms98-a-0051 254.195625 262.054375 that we might be good might be good for us to take into consideration is um in Israel they have this [vocalized-noise] you heard of that
sw4837B-ms98-a-0052 262.054375 264.544125 [noise] where the kids are
sw4837B-ms98-a-0053 264.544125 270.829000 it's kind of like of like uh a community school i guess where you know all the kids um
sw4837B-ms98-a-0054 270.829000 277.613000 it's kind of like a boarding school i guess and they're but they're raised by adults who sort of act as
sw4837B-ms98-a-0055 277.613000 281.050625 their parents you know because i guess in Israel
sw4837B-ms98-a-0056 281.050625 287.999000 um you know that happens a lot too that the women are working and or in the army or something like that well um
sw4837B-ms98-a-0057 287.999000 290.498000 um i don't know it seems
sw4837B-ms98-a-0058 290.498000 298.178000 seems to work really well and they somehow they um do it in such a way you know that they they pass on morals pretty well
