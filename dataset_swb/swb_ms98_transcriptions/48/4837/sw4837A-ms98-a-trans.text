sw4837A-ms98-a-0033 142.514750 150.253875 i don't know i've got mixed views i come from a very very conservative family where there are you know it's like you me[ntioned]- you m[entioned]- it's like you described the first time
sw4837A-ms98-a-0034 150.253875 156.425750 um where the the husband's in control the wife stays home raises the family things like that however
sw4837A-ms98-a-0035 156.425750 165.667125 i don't think that's a realistic approach anymore especially with the the rising cost of living and things like that there's there's almost no way you can make it with a one income family anymore
sw4837A-ms98-a-0036 165.667125 167.085000 um
sw4837A-ms98-a-0037 167.085000 173.069375 you know regardless of the of the social impact or the the familial impact you got to think about
sw4837A-ms98-a-0038 173.069375 179.170000 just the pragmatic side of it in terms of how can you afford to raise however many kids one or nine
sw4837A-ms98-a-0039 179.170000 184.110125 um with one income and it's never going to work i don't think um

sw4837A-ms98-a-0046 202.121125 209.671625 i know i know what you mean because there's there's a lot of stress in that kind of an environment where the husband's gone all day
sw4837A-ms98-a-0047 209.671625 214.803750 and comes home at night and like the wife is like the first thing she hits him with is all these problems
