sw4863A-ms98-a-0002 1.107625 7.187750 [silence]
sw4863A-ms98-a-0003 7.187750 17.088250 right i think it's kind of a loaded question i don't think anybody would say we should pay more [laughter-i] [laughter-think] i think most of us feel that we do pay enough
sw4863A-ms98-a-0004 17.088250 30.833625 [silence]
sw4863A-ms98-a-0005 30.833625 32.356625 um-hum
sw4863A-ms98-a-0006 32.356625 35.502875 [silence]
sw4863A-ms98-a-0007 35.502875 36.849000 right
sw4863A-ms98-a-0008 36.849000 42.727875 [silence]
sw4863A-ms98-a-0009 42.727875 55.370000 [noise] well i- i think what's happened is a lot of these state and city jobs people feel that once they get them they're entitled to them for life and they can kind of take it easy because they're protected by their unions etcetera
sw4863A-ms98-a-0010 55.370000 65.274875 uh during my college years my mom worked for the state and she got me a summer job and when i came in i'm i was just a little eager beaver and i went through whatever work they gave me
sw4863A-ms98-a-0011 65.274875 68.619875 and i found people sitting around me polishing their nails and
sw4863A-ms98-a-0012 68.619875 81.467000 they were downright disgusted with me because i was going to come and go but they were going to live there and they didn't like me you know showing them up and finishing stuff so what they did was give me worse and worse and ugly and uglier things to do
sw4863A-ms98-a-0013 81.467000 95.731875 so i would just back off bu[t]- and you know that's what it seemed like from the inside um it's not that no one works i think what happens is it's a personality thing and those who just like to do a job well done get to do the work for three or four freeloaders
sw4863A-ms98-a-0014 95.731875 103.936500 who don't do it i th[ink]- i- i you know i think it's a cross section of humanity it's not so much all state workers i mean it's hard to generalize like that
sw4863A-ms98-a-0015 103.936500 176.647000 [silence]
sw4863A-ms98-a-0016 176.647000 178.810250 oh
sw4863A-ms98-a-0017 178.810250 189.959500 [silence]
sw4863A-ms98-a-0018 189.959500 198.737500 apparently there's been a uh movement where i am i'm on Long Island which is a suburb of N[ew]- New York City
sw4863A-ms98-a-0019 198.737500 210.509625 and um there's been a movement by home owners to try get their their home taxes reduced they feel their too high and there's all kind of review boards that if you feel strongly about it you can challenge your tax
sw4863A-ms98-a-0020 210.509625 221.278125 uh the newspapers now running an article on state universities which you know everyone kind of ass[ume]- at least i did assume that you can get a good education and pay so much less than a private University
sw4863A-ms98-a-0021 221.278125 234.185375 and it seems to be more of an expose than anything i mean you hearing ghastly stories about kids who are taking four and fi[ve]- like five years to graduate because when they try to sign up for a class they're so over crowded they can't get in the class
sw4863A-ms98-a-0022 234.185375 241.125125 so in order to finish all the uh requisites they have to just stay longer until they can finally get a hold of the class
sw4863A-ms98-a-0023 241.125125 249.238875 that th[is]- this i thought was totally outrageous that they have teaching assistants well that's that's an old thing you know having graduate students teach undergrads
sw4863A-ms98-a-0024 249.238875 260.926125 but some of these people are you know from India and Asia and they don't speak English well enough for the students to understand now how could they possibly have someone teaching a class who is not fluent 
sw4863A-ms98-a-0025 260.926125 266.301500 and and i heard that that's true i mean that's i find that incredible that's a [vocalized-noise]
sw4863A-ms98-a-0026 266.301500 267.341250 [silence]
sw4863A-ms98-a-0027 267.341250 272.176500 uh yeah well i guess i have a a private um
sw4863A-ms98-a-0028 272.176500 287.091500 ar[gument]- argument with them i'm a substitute teacher who you know have have has raised a family my kids are older now and i'd like to work full-time and they're firing teachers left and right and the classes are getting bigger our school budgets are really down
sw4863A-ms98-a-0029 287.091500 291.603750 maybe it's not handled real efficiently you know that's that's very likely
sw4863A-ms98-a-0030 291.603750 299.458000 my you know my husband's in the computer business and the schools just you know they're updating computers are the hot new thing and my husband was
