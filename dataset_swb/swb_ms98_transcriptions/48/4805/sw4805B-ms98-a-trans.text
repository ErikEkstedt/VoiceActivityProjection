sw4805B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.143375 [noise]
sw4805B-ms98-a-0002 1.143375 13.318125 [silence]
sw4805B-ms98-a-0003 13.318125 16.842125 i had to run close the door so i didn't hear the whole thing
sw4805B-ms98-a-0004 16.842125 25.319000 [silence]
sw4805B-ms98-a-0005 25.319000 30.731250 [noise] well i think it's uh the way it is is probably uh
sw4805B-ms98-a-0006 30.731250 38.276500 pretty good as far as the uh you know some of them_1 are i believe you uh the defendant has a
sw4805B-ms98-a-0007 38.276500 43.092250 chance to request trial by jury if they want
sw4805B-ms98-a-0008 43.092250 45.674125 and i guess uh
sw4805B-ms98-a-0009 45.674125 49.247875 and there are some cases that go to the judge
sw4805B-ms98-a-0010 49.247875 63.889375 [silence]
sw4805B-ms98-a-0011 63.889375 67.115500 well i uh again i think it's uh
sw4805B-ms98-a-0012 67.115500 76.127875 i think the defendant should have a choice there if he wants a trial by jury and then uh with the option of letting you know allowing the judge to try it
sw4805B-ms98-a-0013 76.127875 77.142750 [silence]
sw4805B-ms98-a-0014 77.142750 79.006875 some cases it
sw4805B-ms98-a-0015 79.006875 80.550750 you know
sw4805B-ms98-a-0016 80.550750 84.392375 probably doesn't require a full jury
sw4805B-ms98-a-0017 84.392375 89.067250 [silence]
sw4805B-ms98-a-0018 89.067250 91.350125 yeah exactly that
sw4805B-ms98-a-0019 91.350125 106.389375 [silence]
sw4805B-ms98-a-0020 106.389375 110.719000 you think it uh it always comes out the best with a jury
sw4805B-ms98-a-0021 110.719000 112.492000 um-hum
sw4805B-ms98-a-0022 112.492000 113.847375 [silence]
sw4805B-ms98-a-0023 113.847375 120.710500 what about the fact that uh a jury may be six people in some cases but um
sw4805B-ms98-a-0024 120.710500 124.628500 uh maybe they're not you know
sw4805B-ms98-a-0025 124.628500 127.204500 one reason or another just
sw4805B-ms98-a-0026 127.204500 128.419250 [silence]
sw4805B-ms98-a-0027 128.419250 132.010125 maybe you get a bad bunch or [laughter-what] [laughter-ever] and they uh
sw4805B-ms98-a-0028 132.010125 143.706250 [silence]
sw4805B-ms98-a-0029 143.706250 145.109750 um-hum
sw4805B-ms98-a-0030 145.109750 148.539500 [silence]
sw4805B-ms98-a-0031 148.539500 149.783125 yeah
sw4805B-ms98-a-0032 149.783125 155.998875 [silence]
sw4805B-ms98-a-0033 155.998875 158.399250 i tell you what the [laughter-to[pic]-]
sw4805B-ms98-a-0034 158.399250 163.253500 al[ong]- along those lines a little more exciting topic is what the uh
sw4805B-ms98-a-0035 163.253500 170.583125 the uh criminal uh punishment panel is uh reviewing in Austin right now
sw4805B-ms98-a-0036 170.583125 173.429000 now which is uh
sw4805B-ms98-a-0037 173.429000 181.278375 reducing a rape case without a firearm or without a weapon to uh just practically a misdemeanor
sw4805B-ms98-a-0038 181.278375 183.118500 yeah
sw4805B-ms98-a-0039 183.118500 185.189750 actually they call it a fi[fth]-
sw4805B-ms98-a-0040 185.189750 186.538625 [silence]
sw4805B-ms98-a-0041 186.538625 190.327250 fifth fourth or fifth degree felony which is [laughter]
sw4805B-ms98-a-0042 190.327250 193.641375 can't ev[en]- you know be no jail time
sw4805B-ms98-a-0043 193.641375 201.511125 and uh [noise] and of course the hottest topic of the day along jurisprudence lines is the uh 
sw4805B-ms98-a-0044 201.511125 205.524500 the early release of prisoners at least down here in Houston it is
sw4805B-ms98-a-0045 205.524500 218.184375 [silence]
sw4805B-ms98-a-0046 218.184375 219.622500 um-hum
sw4805B-ms98-a-0047 219.622500 231.345750 [silence]
sw4805B-ms98-a-0048 231.345750 232.661500 [laughter]
sw4805B-ms98-a-0049 232.661500 234.959375 [silence]
sw4805B-ms98-a-0050 234.959375 238.669875 well i uh [noise] they sure need to do something
sw4805B-ms98-a-0051 238.669875 240.499500 with uh
sw4805B-ms98-a-0052 240.499500 243.752000 you know early release there's a uh
sw4805B-ms98-a-0053 243.752000 246.428000 as far as letting them_1 out
sw4805B-ms98-a-0054 246.428000 258.922375 when you have five percent of your capacity is still available i think they're uh they're just they're just con[cerned]- too concerned with prisoners rights and not enough concern for victim's rights you know
sw4805B-ms98-a-0055 258.922375 260.844500 i mean uh
sw4805B-ms98-a-0056 260.844500 264.445750 [silence]
sw4805B-ms98-a-0057 264.445750 265.651375 yeah
sw4805B-ms98-a-0058 265.651375 275.614875 [silence]
sw4805B-ms98-a-0059 275.614875 280.260750 well there's a there's a bill been passed last year that uh
sw4805B-ms98-a-0060 280.260750 282.162125 would allow
sw4805B-ms98-a-0061 282.162125 289.842250 i don't know exactly where these beds are but there's some i guess they tap in like hospital beds and all and
sw4805B-ms98-a-0062 289.842250 299.074000 what the uh intent is to is lump them in with the actual prison beds they have and and that way thereby increasing the uh capacity immediately
