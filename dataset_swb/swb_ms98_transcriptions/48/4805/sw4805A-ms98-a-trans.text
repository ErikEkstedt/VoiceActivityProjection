sw4805A-ms98-a-0002 0.504250 2.133250 um
sw4805A-ms98-a-0003 2.133250 13.453500 i'm i'm not to familiar with the topic because uh i haven't been in that [laughter-situation] i guess [laughter] but i watch a lot of the documentaries on TV and that kind of thing it always kind of interests me
sw4805A-ms98-a-0004 13.453500 14.749375 and
sw4805A-ms98-a-0005 14.749375 16.113250 [silence]
sw4805A-ms98-a-0006 16.113250 18.776000 oh okay about um
sw4805A-ms98-a-0007 18.776000 27.049375 penalty and trials and that kind of thing if it should be left up to the judge or trial by jury or to the people that kind of thing
sw4805A-ms98-a-0008 27.049375 42.663750 [silence]
sw4805A-ms98-a-0009 42.663750 43.992000 yeah
sw4805A-ms98-a-0010 43.992000 49.396500 [silence]
sw4805A-ms98-a-0011 49.396500 52.504000 um and i think the topic was
sw4805A-ms98-a-0012 52.504000 57.472250 like um should it be that way or should it be
sw4805A-ms98-a-0013 57.472250 59.140375 um
sw4805A-ms98-a-0014 59.140375 62.093125 up to the people or
sw4805A-ms98-a-0015 62.093125 63.701250 um
sw4805A-ms98-a-0016 63.701250 65.115875 i think
sw4805A-ms98-a-0017 65.115875 67.198000 [silence]
sw4805A-ms98-a-0018 67.198000 68.189250 that's
sw4805A-ms98-a-0019 68.189250 76.740625 [silence]
sw4805A-ms98-a-0020 76.740625 77.820000 yeah
sw4805A-ms98-a-0021 77.820000 84.306250 [silence]
sw4805A-ms98-a-0022 84.306250 95.563250 i would assume it would take more of the taxpayers' money for it to go through trial by jury but sometimes it seems like it comes out the outcome comes out the best 
sw4805A-ms98-a-0023 95.563250 107.196375 some[times]- in in most cases it comes out the best when it's trial by jury but i i could see where it could take up a lot of um the community's money that way rather than just leaving it up to the judge
sw4805A-ms98-a-0024 107.196375 109.573375 [silence]
sw4805A-ms98-a-0025 109.573375 115.122625 i'd say for the most part not you know it's it's it's hard it really is but i
sw4805A-ms98-a-0026 115.122625 130.440625 [silence]
sw4805A-ms98-a-0027 130.440625 133.668125 yeah you can you can
sw4805A-ms98-a-0028 133.668125 140.314500 but it seems like when i[t's]- when it's trial by jury it's a little more detailed it's a little more slower and um
sw4805A-ms98-a-0029 140.314500 144.343875 i don't know you it's uh it it requires a little bit more thinking
sw4805A-ms98-a-0030 144.343875 157.552625 um -[re]quires a little more research that kind of thing so that's why i say it probably mo[st]- in most cases i would think it would co[me]- the outcome would be better in most cases not always but uh
sw4805A-ms98-a-0031 157.552625 169.713250 [silence]
sw4805A-ms98-a-0032 169.713250 171.091000 uh-huh

sw4805A-ms98-a-0041 208.542625 219.235750 yeah that's that's real scary you know i i i just think things are there's a lot of changes right now that are going on and it's getting to be where it's really it's just real scary
sw4805A-ms98-a-0042 219.235750 225.562375 um i don't know but then again i guess it takes up a lot of your taxpayers money and time
sw4805A-ms98-a-0043 225.562375 230.112000 and um i don't know it's just it's
