sw4877B-ms98-a-0025 129.975750 131.459125 well
sw4877B-ms98-a-0026 131.459125 138.635125 when when uh the first uh ten years see first ten or twelve years i stayed home
sw4877B-ms98-a-0027 138.635125 147.088500 and um and then after that i i went to work and um uh uh a couple times i just uh
sw4877B-ms98-a-0028 147.088500 155.940500 um you know th[en]- then i had one job and then that job ran out because_1 it's kind of a government seeded type job and then and then like about la[ter]- later i
sw4877B-ms98-a-0029 155.940500 169.100500 i tried to get the baby to a babysitter -[sup]posed to be good uh recommended person from the church and i knew her personally she have two kids of her own and everything but i quit my job because i couldn't stand how she was taking care of my child
sw4877B-ms98-a-0030 169.100500 178.363375 i mean first of all uh you know her children were sick all the time so when my son stayed over there he got sick same thing same thing that the her kids had right
sw4877B-ms98-a-0031 178.363375 185.833125 and so um we didn't take her over there until like about eleven o'clock then he she'd take my son and her daughter over t[o]- to kindergarten
sw4877B-ms98-a-0032 185.833125 193.586125 but sh[e]- uh that day um i was saying now he he's sick and she goes well because_1 he has the same thing that all my kids have that's what he got
sw4877B-ms98-a-0033 193.586125 206.398125 you know i goes well okay so it's not like he's gonna infect her kids but then what happened was is i said uh he just threw up and kindergarten starts at eleven thirty so she said well she'll keep him home and he'll probably just sleep anyway
sw4877B-ms98-a-0034 206.398125 211.050375 well you know what that woman sent her sent him to kindergarten
sw4877B-ms98-a-0035 211.050375 220.022625 she sent him to kindergarten as soon as he went there the teacher took one look at him and he threw up again and they put him in the nursery i mean they put him in the nurse's office
sw4877B-ms98-a-0036 220.022625 227.458250 and then what happened was is you know they gave her a call because they knew that she was my babysitter called her and they said um
sw4877B-ms98-a-0037 227.458250 230.099625 that he's sick well she wasn't home
sw4877B-ms98-a-0038 230.099625 241.315375 i mean her all her kids are sick but she wasn't home right and her and her her daughter that was in kindergarten with him also did not go to school because she was sick
sw4877B-ms98-a-0039 241.315375 250.535250 now why didn't he why didn't she keep him home with her no she didn't do that so it got to the point where he he's -[sup]posed to get out of uh kindergarten like about two thirty
sw4877B-ms98-a-0040 250.535250 257.662125 and i had to leave work it was it was five o'clock in the evening and i found out he was still there at school
sw4877B-ms98-a-0041 257.662125 263.222750 and they were calling me and they says somebody's got to pick him up and i kept thinking that she was gonna get picked up
sw4877B-ms98-a-0042 263.222750 272.527875 she was gonna pick him up because_1 she only lives in you know like two blocks away from the school i was trying to get my husband to come and pick him up and all that kind of stuff and he had a hundred and four fever they couldn't
sw4877B-ms98-a-0043 272.527875 285.755250 uh to give him anything because they're not allowed to at school and everything i was so furious i i quit that job and i stayed home for a while longer then i went and got a um a job in real estate where i can kind of adjust my time a little bit better
sw4877B-ms98-a-0044 285.755250 291.325125 yeah but uh i haven't had any good really very good experience with child care
sw4877B-ms98-a-0045 291.325125 299.042000 [silence]
