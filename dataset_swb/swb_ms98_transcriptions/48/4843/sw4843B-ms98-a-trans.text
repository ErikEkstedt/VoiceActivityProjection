sw4843B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.030250 [noise]
sw4843B-ms98-a-0002 1.030250 48.285125 [silence]
sw4843B-ms98-a-0003 48.285125 53.134750 well i have to i have to say that i would be very in favor
sw4843B-ms98-a-0004 53.134750 54.825000 of
sw4843B-ms98-a-0005 54.825000 65.019250 a situation where the revenue generation activities of the government such as the IRS
sw4843B-ms98-a-0006 65.019250 68.249375 are monitored and
sw4843B-ms98-a-0007 68.249375 71.874625 spending for year
sw4843B-ms98-a-0008 71.874625 74.006375 X plus one
sw4843B-ms98-a-0009 74.006375 80.342750 can go no higher than the revenues brought in during year X 
sw4843B-ms98-a-0010 80.342750 86.233375 so that uh forget about this balanced budget this would immediately force them
sw4843B-ms98-a-0011 86.233375 95.438250 to say well geez um you know last year was a bad year and we've only got you know we only took in two hundred million dollars uh
sw4843B-ms98-a-0012 95.438250 105.286250 i realize that i'm off by a factor of about five but [laughter] we only took in two hundred million even though this year is going better we can still only spend two hundred million
sw4843B-ms98-a-0013 105.286250 128.251750 [silence]
sw4843B-ms98-a-0014 128.251750 130.561375 it's going to affect your kids
sw4843B-ms98-a-0015 130.561375 132.897625 [noise] [vocalized-noise]
sw4843B-ms98-a-0016 132.897625 134.350125 [silence]
sw4843B-ms98-a-0017 134.350125 139.871250 well i- i think this has always been the case with the American public in that
sw4843B-ms98-a-0018 139.871250 148.957875 it's made up of a bunch of special interest groups it's only recently that special interest groups have started to exert more power
sw4843B-ms98-a-0019 148.957875 158.164250 uh for instance retirees they've started to up social security benefits it used to be so social security was just the final safety net
sw4843B-ms98-a-0020 158.164250 162.446750 but it's not that way anymore uh now you've got people who have
sw4843B-ms98-a-0021 162.446750 172.986625 uh sixty thousand in tax free income because they invested wisely during their working years and they're still collecting social security and all of that money is tax free 
sw4843B-ms98-a-0022 172.986625 180.722750 i'm sorry i think that um all of the investment income regardless of how you invested should be taxable
sw4843B-ms98-a-0023 180.722750 187.192000 and the thing is that you should loose social security benefits based on how much income you have
sw4843B-ms98-a-0024 187.192000 200.710125 [silence]
sw4843B-ms98-a-0025 200.710125 209.829375 uh yeah i- i- i- i agree i think that social security ought to be done away with and put into the uh [vocalized-noise] tax
sw4843B-ms98-a-0026 209.829375 214.619000 and that's what it is so go ahead and put it in there and uh
sw4843B-ms98-a-0027 214.619000 223.911500 uh you know i mean they're treating it as a tax they're treating the money as tax revenue it's not something that they're putting aside for later use it goes into the general fund whether or not
sw4843B-ms98-a-0028 223.911500 229.683000 it wants to to go there that's that's were it goes and it's being used so i mean um
sw4843B-ms98-a-0029 229.683000 240.106375 uh my personal opinion out here in California we just instituted term limits on the uh Senate and House for the state legislature
sw4843B-ms98-a-0030 240.106375 243.734375 and i don't know whether it's going to have
sw4843B-ms98-a-0031 243.734375 252.808875 uh the affect that of course all the the career politicos here say oh my God you know you're going to have a bunch of amateurs running the state legislature
sw4843B-ms98-a-0032 252.808875 258.082000 well well so what [laughter] they can't do any worse than the guys that are in there now and [vocalized-noise]
sw4843B-ms98-a-0033 258.082000 259.978625 [silence]
sw4843B-ms98-a-0034 259.978625 262.026250 [laughter]
sw4843B-ms98-a-0035 262.026250 270.372250 [silence]
sw4843B-ms98-a-0036 270.372250 271.734875 yeah
sw4843B-ms98-a-0037 271.734875 275.678000 [silence]
sw4843B-ms98-a-0038 275.678000 282.456750 well i think that what we may end up with with the term limits is you get more people involved in government 
sw4843B-ms98-a-0039 282.456750 290.171625 you get more people seeing how it should work and i think what that will do is that will allow people to say well wait a minute
sw4843B-ms98-a-0040 290.171625 299.522000 we've got to compromise we've got to work on something we need more of a vision and less of uh God i'll grab my money and do everything i can
