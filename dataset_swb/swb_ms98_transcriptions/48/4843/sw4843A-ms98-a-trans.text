sw4843A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 7.217500 well my basic idea on dealing with the US budget as unrealistic and [laughter] as it may be
sw4843A-ms98-a-0002 7.217500 16.125875 is to first of all put an end to these kinds of uh hidden user fees and uh
sw4843A-ms98-a-0003 16.125875 20.653625 um other types of uh tricks that have been used
sw4843A-ms98-a-0004 20.653625 34.307500 to help mask the size of this thing let's get a hold of what the real true sized of it is and then let's deal with it immediately and as quickly as possible even if it means some short term higher taxes
sw4843A-ms98-a-0005 34.307500 43.570375 to get it down and uh then let's try to make some reforms with the the congressional community ha ha [laughter]
sw4843A-ms98-a-0006 43.570375 48.330875 try and make it so that we don't have this problem in the future

sw4843A-ms98-a-0012 105.123750 115.600000 i- i just keep seeing unfortunately the p[roblem]- a lot of the problem why we have this deficits balloon especially during the eighties is just because the American people
sw4843A-ms98-a-0013 115.600000 123.617250 bought into this notion that well we can just uh we don't need a higher taxes certainly not they get enough of our money already and
sw4843A-ms98-a-0014 123.617250 129.367500 the deficit doesn't seem to affect me in my daily life and routine so so what 
sw4843A-ms98-a-0015 129.367500 135.830750 yeah i know but you notice these people are only now starting to think ahead

sw4843A-ms98-a-0033 261.911375 271.039500 the legislatures are opposing parties are controlled by opposing parties which means basically every year we have a scream and terrified over the budget
sw4843A-ms98-a-0034 271.039500 276.480875 in this state which is delayed eternally and then they want to kill each other you know [laughter]
