sw4825A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 2.628500 have you had to return anything lately 
sw4825A-ms98-a-0002 2.628500 15.877125 [silence]
sw4825A-ms98-a-0003 15.877125 17.131625 uh
sw4825A-ms98-a-0004 17.131625 25.904000 [silence]
sw4825A-ms98-a-0005 25.904000 30.205125 did you think it was uh the mechanic's problem or uh well with the bolt 
sw4825A-ms98-a-0006 30.205125 46.741625 [silence]
sw4825A-ms98-a-0007 46.741625 48.772000 um did you have to pay this fellow 
sw4825A-ms98-a-0008 48.772000 49.977625 [silence]
sw4825A-ms98-a-0009 49.977625 53.032625 [laughter] i wouldn't image you'd want [laughter-to]
sw4825A-ms98-a-0010 53.032625 58.388125 [silence]
sw4825A-ms98-a-0011 58.388125 59.629625 um
sw4825A-ms98-a-0012 59.629625 64.172500 no i was doing some thinking about products and have they really changed 
sw4825A-ms98-a-0013 64.172500 68.482000 i- i think it's hard to say cross the board that you're not getting what you're getting what you pay for anymore
sw4825A-ms98-a-0014 68.482000 74.979250 i um just recently had an experience with uh Sears uh do you have that down in Florida 
sw4825A-ms98-a-0015 74.979250 80.471500 well Sears is kind of famous for taking back almost anything they're very good about it
sw4825A-ms98-a-0016 80.471500 85.317500 i had bought a leather jacket almost about twelve years ago for my ex-husband
sw4825A-ms98-a-0017 85.317500 98.606375 he is still wearing the darn thing and you know after some time i was fortunate enough to get remarried to a really nice fellow and i happen to like this leather [vocalized-noise] jackets and i bought him one and his lasted about a year and a half and i said that you know there's no 
sw4825A-ms98-a-0018 98.606375 102.360750 uh this makes no sense the good guy didn't get the good [laughter-jacket]
sw4825A-ms98-a-0019 102.360750 109.243250 and i called them up and i said i would expect a winter coat you know we do have in winters in New York and y[ou]- i guess you use it four months out of the year 
sw4825A-ms98-a-0020 109.243250 115.278500 um this guy didn't get eight months out of a winter coat all the stitches were coming out it's a real mess
sw4825A-ms98-a-0021 115.278500 123.554875 you know i really expect you to do something about this and i hadn't really hang on to receipts or anything and it it took much song and dance 
sw4825A-ms98-a-0022 123.554875 128.081750 uh to get it done but i just picked up a brand new leather jacket today
sw4825A-ms98-a-0023 128.081750 135.107375 so i['m]- i'm pretty pleased about that the thing is it only cost about a hundred dollars which for a leather jacket is quite reasonable
sw4825A-ms98-a-0024 135.107375 139.788375 but the repair i was going to just bring it in and have it repair the repair would've been about seventy
sw4825A-ms98-a-0025 139.788375 143.301250 and i was darned if i was going to do it and i hated to throw it out 
sw4825A-ms98-a-0026 143.301250 148.891875 so i- i think if you make enough noise you can get your problems taken care of in most cases
sw4825A-ms98-a-0027 148.891875 150.651125 [silence]
sw4825A-ms98-a-0028 150.651125 158.038250 uh yeah i- i had to bring it in i had to talk to people in Roanoke Virginia i guess that's Sears central [laughter]
sw4825A-ms98-a-0029 158.038250 167.974375 but they were really good about it you know they i- i wasn't nasty i didn't attack them i said i'm so used to your stuff being wonderful i'm so shocked [laughter] and alarmed [laughter-that] this should happen 
sw4825A-ms98-a-0030 167.974375 174.319375 and i think it's how you conduct yourself as well if if you're kind of mean and nasty you get treated [laughter-mean] [laughter-and] [laughter-nasty] 
sw4825A-ms98-a-0031 174.319375 180.351500 but um i was very please and and it is true i uh you know generally they back up what they have and 
sw4825A-ms98-a-0032 180.351500 189.120625 it worked out nicely fortunately and it's you know it's like you know when someone else hits your car it's not your fault and you don't pay for it but you're majorly inconvenienced
sw4825A-ms98-a-0033 189.120625 198.669750 and i had to carry this jacket around to repair shops and make dozens of phone [vocalized-noise] phone calls to get it fixed you know it's not like it didn't cost me anything in time and effort 
sw4825A-ms98-a-0034 198.669750 200.646875 but um
sw4825A-ms98-a-0035 200.646875 202.083750 [vocalized-noise]
sw4825A-ms98-a-0036 202.083750 204.393500 [silence]
sw4825A-ms98-a-0037 204.393500 205.436250 [vocalized-noise]
sw4825A-ms98-a-0038 205.436250 207.126625 [silence]
sw4825A-ms98-a-0039 207.126625 213.758250 right well you you were talking about boats it made me think about cars i had a Ford station wagon that one day just died
sw4825A-ms98-a-0040 213.758250 222.565125 and i called up the repair shop apparently this some kind of uh box in the uh Ford car that just dies and they know it dies
sw4825A-ms98-a-0041 222.565125 228.155750 and in every car you're going to have that's a Ford car it's going to die and i guess after so many miles
sw4825A-ms98-a-0042 228.155750 231.968625 and he told me over the phone before he even saw my car that's probably what it was 
sw4825A-ms98-a-0043 231.968625 237.695625 and it is and and they build this these little time bombs in so [laughter] [laughter-you] [laughter-know] [laughter-so] you got to bring it back 
sw4825A-ms98-a-0044 237.695625 239.469875 [vocalized-noise]
sw4825A-ms98-a-0045 239.469875 240.926000 huh
sw4825A-ms98-a-0046 240.926000 242.847625 [silence]
sw4825A-ms98-a-0047 242.847625 251.468375 [laughter-well] [laughter] it was some kind of part where you can't even an electrical spark off the engine anymore it just the whole thing just dies when you this thing goes 
sw4825A-ms98-a-0048 251.468375 256.670000 and you really don't know when it's going to happen you just know that you're going to be stranded if you get [laughter-another] [laughter-Ford] 
sw4825A-ms98-a-0049 256.670000 257.979875 and
sw4825A-ms98-a-0050 257.979875 259.079375 [silence]
sw4825A-ms98-a-0051 259.079375 261.350250 it's kind of upsetting
sw4825A-ms98-a-0052 261.350250 265.514500 a[t]- at the time i knew what it did and what it was called but i don't remember that now
sw4825A-ms98-a-0053 265.514500 270.911000 have you found that uh clothes and shoes and things you bought [vocalized-noise] shoddy than they have in the past
sw4825A-ms98-a-0054 270.911000 276.479375 [silence]
sw4825A-ms98-a-0055 276.479375 277.896750 um
sw4825A-ms98-a-0056 277.896750 293.284875 [silence]
sw4825A-ms98-a-0057 293.284875 294.479750 um
sw4825A-ms98-a-0058 294.479750 299.042000 [silence]
