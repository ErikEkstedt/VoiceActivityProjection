sw4847A-ms98-a-0008 20.673375 24.871625 [silence]

sw4847A-ms98-a-0010 26.288750 27.772875 [silence]
sw4847A-ms98-a-0011 27.772875 29.311625 well that's cool
sw4847A-ms98-a-0012 29.311625 35.675375 i used to do quite a bit when i was a little kid but um recently i haven't done much at all i- i did
sw4847A-ms98-a-0013 35.675375 44.066875 uh i a while back i started refurbishing a piano we've had in our in our family for a long time it's an old antique upright
sw4847A-ms98-a-0014 44.066875 49.181375 and uh kind of started to do some work with and stuff [vocalized-noise]
sw4847A-ms98-a-0015 49.181375 52.752875 uh yeah it is and i really haven't had time to do much with it
sw4847A-ms98-a-0016 52.752875 60.230500 um it's a nice piano but it's just uh it's like uh like the intro said if you had more time and [laughter-more] tools you know
sw4847A-ms98-a-0017 60.230500 69.368375 but uh other than that i- i haven't done a whole lot i did kind of make a coffee table out of a piano bench which was interesting
sw4847A-ms98-a-0018 69.368375 77.372375 um and that worked out pretty well i actually gave that to a friend of mine since i really didn't have much use for it but uh
sw4847A-ms98-a-0019 77.372375 81.015500 so y[ou]- you got your house then [vocalized-noise] work out
sw4847A-ms98-a-0020 81.015500 82.864125 [silence]
sw4847A-ms98-a-0021 82.864125 84.161000 [vocalized-noise]
sw4847A-ms98-a-0022 84.161000 88.341125 [silence]
sw4847A-ms98-a-0023 88.341125 92.686750 sure is that what you consider a hobby then for you
sw4847A-ms98-a-0024 92.686750 95.475000 would that would you consider that a hobby then
sw4847A-ms98-a-0025 95.475000 101.189500 [silence]
sw4847A-ms98-a-0026 101.189500 104.531875 yeah yeah for me i don't know it's
sw4847A-ms98-a-0027 104.531875 110.011750 my brother is a is a contractor and he actually does quite a bit of carpentry and wood work
sw4847A-ms98-a-0028 110.011750 120.380500 so i don't see him very often but last time i did we did some stuff he uh he had a job where he's putting in tongue and grooves slaps for a a ceiling actually
sw4847A-ms98-a-0029 120.380500 124.355250 and so i- i helped him do some of that and uh
sw4847A-ms98-a-0030 124.355250 129.044625 and like that but aside from that i'm a i'm a student at the University of Central Florida
sw4847A-ms98-a-0031 129.044625 132.764125 [vocalized-noise] aside from my classes i don't do a lot of uh
sw4847A-ms98-a-0032 132.764125 138.387250 of woodworking per say i've got a lot of other hobbies but not necessarily that so
sw4847A-ms98-a-0033 138.387250 147.995000 [silence]
sw4847A-ms98-a-0034 147.995000 149.226000 right
sw4847A-ms98-a-0035 149.226000 150.262625 [silence]
sw4847A-ms98-a-0036 150.262625 159.255625 i actually would like to do more of it though i kind of get into it it's it's fun to get started on something you know and and actually have a project that you're working on you know
sw4847A-ms98-a-0037 159.255625 163.347375 [silence]
sw4847A-ms98-a-0038 163.347375 167.361375 right you you've actually created something and had input into it
sw4847A-ms98-a-0039 167.361375 175.140375 and also it's it i don't know i don't know about you but it's kind of neat to see something that you can create out wood you know it's like woe [laughter]
sw4847A-ms98-a-0040 175.140375 177.145625 [laughter] didn't know you could do that
sw4847A-ms98-a-0041 177.145625 187.602625 but uh and also some of the the little tools and and techniques that that carpenters use um my girlfriend's father is also is also a contractor in terms of carpentry and stuff
sw4847A-ms98-a-0042 187.602625 197.729500 and he'd made her bed and i was actually taking a look at it and some of the stuff uh you could see the techniques that he used to reinforce uh the braces and things like that
sw4847A-ms98-a-0043 197.729500 200.114625 they're really pretty ingenious and [vocalized-noise]
sw4847A-ms98-a-0044 200.114625 208.869500 i hadn't seen them anywhere else there were some some um timing Bruce slots there and some things some particular methods that he'd used
sw4847A-ms98-a-0045 208.869500 217.197625 um which were kind of neat and he's Vietnamese so i'm wondering if if maybe the cultural difference made a made a difference in the way he worked at
sw4847A-ms98-a-0046 217.197625 220.367750 um i didn't ask him about it but i
sw4847A-ms98-a-0047 220.367750 227.974250 [silence]
sw4847A-ms98-a-0048 227.974250 229.583125 right
sw4847A-ms98-a-0049 229.583125 235.332750 yeah they had to kind of use some uh some different renovative kind of techniques to do that with
sw4847A-ms98-a-0050 235.332750 238.576375 where do you where do you live again
sw4847A-ms98-a-0051 238.576375 244.105125 okay so i'm thinking that's primarily pine trees for the most part in that area
sw4847A-ms98-a-0052 244.105125 248.209875 [silence]
sw4847A-ms98-a-0053 248.209875 252.775125 i'm thinking if you were to do something what kind of wood would you most likely use over there
sw4847A-ms98-a-0054 252.775125 261.220250 and i guess uh really you can get any any wood that's available but i'm thinking in terms of cost pine pine would probably be cheapest there
sw4847A-ms98-a-0055 261.220250 263.077500 [silence]
sw4847A-ms98-a-0056 263.077500 265.678000 yeah oak is a lot better i think
sw4847A-ms98-a-0057 265.678000 268.771750 [silence]
sw4847A-ms98-a-0058 268.771750 273.845125 it's real soft and and kind of pliable and that's that's not real good but uh
sw4847A-ms98-a-0059 273.845125 276.180125 [silence]
sw4847A-ms98-a-0060 276.180125 283.464750 yeah i used to live in a before i moved up to Minneapolis i- i lived in a a duplex in Orlando
sw4847A-ms98-a-0061 283.464750 294.134375 and uh that had some work that had to be done with it some of the the door frames and things and uh i did a little bit of that and that was kind of interesting too kind of fun
sw4847A-ms98-a-0062 294.134375 299.074000 but uh for the most part down there it's it's once again it's pine or oak
