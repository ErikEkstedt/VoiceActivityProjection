sw4895B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 4.667750 [noise]
sw4895B-ms98-a-0002 4.667750 30.982250 [silence]
sw4895B-ms98-a-0003 30.982250 32.498125 uh-huh
sw4895B-ms98-a-0004 32.498125 48.695750 [silence]
sw4895B-ms98-a-0005 48.695750 52.451625 uh i guess it's not totally
sw4895B-ms98-a-0006 52.451625 63.463000 not understandable [laughter] you know i'm i'm sure that if you're looking at whether or not you're going to get elected and have enough money to run that they've got to uh got to take that into consideration
sw4895B-ms98-a-0007 63.463000 94.917500 [silence]
sw4895B-ms98-a-0008 94.917500 101.976875 it's uh well it it's it's such a complicated thing and let me just relate to you uh 
sw4895B-ms98-a-0009 101.976875 112.998625 an experience that i had with politics at a lower level uh and i think what it boils down to is that if you can't find compromise that you're not going to be successful 
sw4895B-ms98-a-0010 112.998625 120.497750 um [noise] in eighty six i was president of of an association called the DPMA Data Processing Management Association 
sw4895B-ms98-a-0011 120.497750 127.228125 uh which was actually at the time we were the third largest chapter in the world we had five hundred plus members
sw4895B-ms98-a-0012 127.228125 136.999875 and it was just i mean an absolute uh un[forseen]- un[forseen]- unforeseen thing that a woman should become president in this good ole boy city okay
sw4895B-ms98-a-0013 136.999875 138.376000 [laughter]
sw4895B-ms98-a-0014 138.376000 151.730125 don't misunderstand me now but it it all came down to the fact that you had to be able to deal i mean we had uh our board our officers and our b[oard]- board of directors of about twenty people now this is a good size group of people to manage
sw4895B-ms98-a-0015 151.730125 155.993250 and to come to one voice on on certain things you understand
sw4895B-ms98-a-0016 155.993250 166.991875 and in my year we did perfectly fine and the the gentlemen that came behind me was a uh wonderful intelligent smooth really good looking successful young black man
sw4895B-ms98-a-0017 166.991875 175.492250 but he had his own agenda and he wouldn't compromise with people he thought that because he was president he could drive through whatever he chose 
sw4895B-ms98-a-0018 175.492250 178.974375 and it was a terrible a terrible situation
sw4895B-ms98-a-0019 178.974375 181.993250 i mean the whole thing almost fell apart
sw4895B-ms98-a-0020 181.993250 183.492125 [silence]
sw4895B-ms98-a-0021 183.492125 194.533750 and i think what you have to do i mean y[ou]- i think it's important that you have an agenda but you also have to be able to to compromise on it because if the majority are against you 
sw4895B-ms98-a-0022 194.533750 201.987750 and you lose more than two or three times you know you lose it it been a a terrible situation for you and for your reputation 
sw4895B-ms98-a-0023 201.987750 213.735875 and i think what happens is in order to get anything passed in the big political system in Washington you have to you know compromise with other people and vote for something maybe you don't really believe in 
sw4895B-ms98-a-0024 213.735875 217.481625 but so that they will vote for something that you're asking for
sw4895B-ms98-a-0025 217.481625 239.469750 [silence]
sw4895B-ms98-a-0026 239.469750 242.990500 and they really want to vote for it [laughter]
sw4895B-ms98-a-0027 242.990500 244.231875 [silence]
sw4895B-ms98-a-0028 244.231875 248.135875 yeah uh-huh
sw4895B-ms98-a-0029 248.135875 261.704250 [silence]
sw4895B-ms98-a-0030 261.704250 263.695625 yes it would
sw4895B-ms98-a-0031 263.695625 278.992125 [silence]
sw4895B-ms98-a-0032 278.992125 291.484250 and you know there's probably about ten percent or maybe less than that five percent of the people who can vote their own conscience and still be successful but all the rest fall by the wayside
sw4895B-ms98-a-0033 291.484250 297.487000 [silence]
sw4895B-ms98-a-0034 297.487000 300.610000 right right i am
