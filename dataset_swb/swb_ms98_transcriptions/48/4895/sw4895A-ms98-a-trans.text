sw4895A-ms98-a-0003 1.767250 7.733875 uh dealings in government are that i'm one of these three million dish owners in this country
sw4895A-ms98-a-0004 7.733875 18.966500 and we've been fighting since about nineteen eighty six to try and get some legislation enacted against some of these cable companies and how they've been stumping on their competition and what little there is
sw4895A-ms98-a-0005 18.966500 31.995500 and it's a very pro consumer type of legislation but we're constantly running into trouble trying to get it passed because we're up against huge pack money donations from the cable TV industry
sw4895A-ms98-a-0006 31.995500 40.291250 in this country and i've come to learn that a lot of these politicians unless you can mobilize enough consumers
sw4895A-ms98-a-0007 40.291250 47.998750 or voters to make a stink about an issue if there's a big pack check involved they'll take the check every single time
sw4895A-ms98-a-0008 47.998750 62.469625 [silence]
sw4895A-ms98-a-0009 62.469625 73.464375 oh sure but i think it goes i you know a little of it obviously is they're getting themselves prepared for when they're out of office when they become consultants or high-powered lobbyists themselves
sw4895A-ms98-a-0010 73.464375 84.981875 and uh i- i think that although some of the people that we have in elected office are upstanding honest people i think that as they're in the system from longer and longer
sw4895A-ms98-a-0011 84.981875 95.533750 they get corrupted by it basically by losing touch with the people that they're supposed to be serving and i think they forget who it is they're supposed to be representing

sw4895A-ms98-a-0025 216.461625 222.269250 yeah that's that kind of um you know i in a in it's gotten very pervasive
sw4895A-ms98-a-0026 222.269250 231.983875 when it comes to expectations on the part of members of each of the party that you try not to cross party lines on certain votes especially these days
sw4895A-ms98-a-0027 231.983875 241.246125 and the problem comes about when you have somebody who wants to vote for something the other party advocates strongly and
sw4895A-ms98-a-0028 241.246125 251.772875 yeah well in some cases they do they vote their conscience and then of course you know they may be punished for not doing the appropriate thing that that came down with the cable issue
sw4895A-ms98-a-0029 251.772875 262.763750 because_1 we had a Republican Senator uh John Danforth who is strongly in support of it but then you had the White House strongly against it because it would reregulate to an extent
sw4895A-ms98-a-0030 262.763750 269.995875 and they just wouldn't hear of it at all so we had trouble but he stood his ground
sw4895A-ms98-a-0031 269.995875 279.994000 and carried with him a lot of in[fluence]- you know people underneath him who are Republicans but at the same point it causes a lot of strife and then people dig their heels in and

sw4895A-ms98-a-0035 290.486750 298.817875 yeah you have to be a real old timer and powerful to be able to do that especially when it's committee assignment handout time and
sw4895A-ms98-a-0036 298.817875 300.610000 things like that
