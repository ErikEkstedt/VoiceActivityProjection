sw4826B-ms98-a-0006 23.012625 27.054625 and uh there's a lot of things that i see
sw4826B-ms98-a-0007 27.054625 30.380250 that are so obviously wrong
sw4826B-ms98-a-0008 30.380250 37.708375 that you would think it'd be easy to correct but the system doesn't allow [laughter-for] the corrections

sw4826B-ms98-a-0021 81.128375 84.917500 [silence]
sw4826B-ms98-a-0022 84.917500 86.273250 um-hum
sw4826B-ms98-a-0023 86.273250 92.077375 [silence]
sw4826B-ms98-a-0024 92.077375 102.611375 well i feel that we're way behind uh i have a son that is in the fourth grade and uh they have just now taken up division
sw4826B-ms98-a-0025 102.611375 114.112250 uh yeah [laughter-and] and you know i [vocalized-noise] my husband and i go to the store and we buy these math books and and fractions and multiplication division things and
sw4826B-ms98-a-0026 114.112250 116.261125 i feel like uh
sw4826B-ms98-a-0027 116.261125 122.423750 there are several areas that we're just really really slow in and uh
sw4826B-ms98-a-0028 122.423750 128.080750 i don't blame the teachers as much as i blame the system it is
sw4826B-ms98-a-0029 128.080750 141.706750 well well for one thing there's not enough money in the school system and the money they do have they're not they do not use it wisely uh she my son's teacher has twenty seven students
sw4826B-ms98-a-0030 141.706750 145.697625 and that's certainly is a lot of students for one person
sw4826B-ms98-a-0031 145.697625 148.942375 to deal with on an [laughter-every] [laughter-day] [laughter-basis]
sw4826B-ms98-a-0032 148.942375 150.215125 uh
sw4826B-ms98-a-0033 150.215125 158.349625 but more than that i don't think that they have the authority to command the attention of the children
sw4826B-ms98-a-0034 158.349625 166.750750 and when you have two kids in that class that constantly keep the [ca/class] class in an uproar and you're not at liberty
sw4826B-ms98-a-0035 166.750750 167.981625 [silence]
sw4826B-ms98-a-0036 167.981625 175.292500 to do something about it other than give them_1 on campus isolation or send them to the principal's office and i[t]-
sw4826B-ms98-a-0037 175.292500 181.242500 it you know it can you it can really be bad uh also i think
sw4826B-ms98-a-0038 181.242500 184.107500 we have a lot of uh
sw4826B-ms98-a-0039 184.107500 186.124875 Hispanics
sw4826B-ms98-a-0040 186.124875 193.928500 and we have a lot of uh uh the county i am i'm in uh the minorities are mostly Hispanic
sw4826B-ms98-a-0041 193.928500 194.974625 [silence]
sw4826B-ms98-a-0042 194.974625 207.375000 no [laughter] we're from a county and uh we're from the county they marched [laughter-in] we're in Forsyth county yes and we and there's very very few blacks uh so uh so that's um
sw4826B-ms98-a-0043 207.375000 214.644000 i i hate to say [vocalized-noise] it's not a problem uh because i hate to feel like they are a problem although they are

sw4826B-ms98-a-0045 218.844000 221.619125 but it is a [laughter-problem]
sw4826B-ms98-a-0046 221.619125 225.414875 uh especially in the inner schools inner city
sw4826B-ms98-a-0047 225.414875 235.782875 [silence]
sw4826B-ms98-a-0048 235.782875 245.446250 well and [vocalized-noise] you can't put all the children in special education uh and if the parents do not care enough to take an interest in whether the homework is done
sw4826B-ms98-a-0049 245.446250 246.834000 you know
sw4826B-ms98-a-0050 246.834000 248.541875 [silence]
sw4826B-ms98-a-0051 248.541875 249.912875 um-hum

sw4826B-ms98-a-0062 285.290000 295.441000 um well it it really is a concern of mine because if we could afford it my son would be in private school we just cannot afford it
sw4826B-ms98-a-0063 295.441000 297.412250 [silence]
sw4826B-ms98-a-0064 297.412250 298.626000 um if
