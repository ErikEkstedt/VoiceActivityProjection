sw4831A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 8.386000 [noise] see wh[en]- whe[n]- when you're with a big company or a big organization a lot of times uh you know the benefits are good and and you know the pay's regular
sw4831A-ms98-a-0002 8.386000 23.144875 but uh we[ll]- you know sometimes you don't get tuned in to what's going on and i- i- i think the biggest benefit or the biggest benefit other than wages that that uh that uh anybody could get in uh in dealing in a with a large company
sw4831A-ms98-a-0003 23.144875 32.130875 is to be in a situation where you you get to know what's going on and maybe that's that's probably the toughest thing in the whole world to to do
sw4831A-ms98-a-0004 32.130875 37.729625 what's what's your feeling about benefits what sort of benefits would you like to get from a big compa[ny]-

sw4831A-ms98-a-0006 59.251500 60.613250 um-hum
sw4831A-ms98-a-0007 60.613250 64.239750 [silence]
sw4831A-ms98-a-0008 64.239750 65.587250 um-hum
sw4831A-ms98-a-0009 65.587250 102.338875 [silence]
sw4831A-ms98-a-0010 102.338875 104.034875 well th[at]- i
sw4831A-ms98-a-0011 104.034875 109.746500 i well i- i work for the government and uh actually i work for the FBI
sw4831A-ms98-a-0012 109.746500 115.796875 and uh and so well you know we we don't there's lots of things that we don't get told for good reason
sw4831A-ms98-a-0013 115.796875 123.375625 but uh but basically uh there's lots of things that that we should know about projects i'm an engineer
sw4831A-ms98-a-0014 123.375625 136.466750 you know i'm i'm a COTR and sometime[s]- and i worked in the same lab with a guy and we didn't really know that much about each other's projects for two years and we should've you know we're we're now collaborating 
sw4831A-ms98-a-0015 136.466750 141.948750 [laughter] and it did[n't]- for two years we didn't and wh[ich]- which was uh kind of stupid
sw4831A-ms98-a-0016 141.948750 154.210125 but uh but uh our organization is doing something else t[omorrow]- on Monday uh we're having a for all unclassified programs we're we're having little tables put out in front of you know lab in the hallways
sw4831A-ms98-a-0017 154.210125 158.819250 and everyb[ody]- all the other employees are going to come around and see what sort of things we do
sw4831A-ms98-a-0018 158.819250 161.390875 which i thought was kind of interesting
sw4831A-ms98-a-0019 161.390875 162.575875 and bu[t]-
sw4831A-ms98-a-0020 162.575875 170.435375 but uh but that sort sort of thing but but i[f]- but ju[st]- i think you can tolerate a lot of problems if you understand what's going on
sw4831A-ms98-a-0021 170.435375 178.487625 and and but of course most time most the time management has a hard time distributing or getting the word out to the people who must know
sw4831A-ms98-a-0022 178.487625 192.049125 and you know if you don't really count if you're not part of the program you might not get told for months or you might you know if it doesn't impact you directly or if your management doesn't think that
sw4831A-ms98-a-0023 192.049125 202.382125 but but regard to benefits you know most companies have most big organizations have decent you know benefits like retirement and that sort of thing
sw4831A-ms98-a-0024 202.382125 212.445500 in the private sector i would think that one of the major uh situations especially when you reach you know the the mid fifties wa[s]- is
sw4831A-ms98-a-0025 212.445500 215.292500 keeping a job until you retire
sw4831A-ms98-a-0026 215.292500 224.340625 uh and engineers are uh [noise] are baggage to most uh uh as they get older to to most companies
sw4831A-ms98-a-0027 224.340625 239.079500 and uh it's very much like the military it windows out you know you you think well boy i'm getting more money and i'm getting more responsibility i'm doing this but as you climb up that tree pretty soon you're the the the branches get smaller on the top of the tree
sw4831A-ms98-a-0028 239.079500 244.679625 and pretty soon somebody falls off i['ve]- i've fallen off twice in my private sector
sw4831A-ms98-a-0029 244.679625 247.925875 and uh [laughter] an[d]- and you know i can get up
sw4831A-ms98-a-0030 247.925875 277.264875 [silence]
sw4831A-ms98-a-0031 277.264875 279.190250 um-hum yeah
sw4831A-ms98-a-0032 279.190250 290.110625 [silence]
sw4831A-ms98-a-0033 290.110625 291.484500 um-hum
sw4831A-ms98-a-0034 291.484500 298.543750 [silence]
sw4831A-ms98-a-0035 298.543750 300.290000 yeah he may be retired
