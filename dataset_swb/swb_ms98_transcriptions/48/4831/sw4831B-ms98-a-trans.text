sw4831B-ms98-a-0003 36.367125 48.222250 well since i'm kind of on the the older side you know i- i- i just feel like uh when i start talking about benefits i talk about i'm concerned about medical benefits [noise]
sw4831B-ms98-a-0004 48.222250 49.823875 um
sw4831B-ms98-a-0005 49.823875 59.984250 my um my husband works for McDonald Douglas and so m[y]- his benefits his medical benefits are so excellent you know that's really great
sw4831B-ms98-a-0006 59.984250 65.058375 you know i work for um Wes[tern]- a bank Western Financial
sw4831B-ms98-a-0007 65.058375 70.999125 and uh they don't let me know really about anything that's going on
sw4831B-ms98-a-0008 70.999125 83.672625 even some of the immediate things that i need to know i don't know it until the next hour and then all of a sudden we know we've gotten changes made we're changing departments we're changing policies we're changing doing other kinds of things which to me is is disturbing
sw4831B-ms98-a-0009 83.672625 94.698500 i mean i feel like if i- i don't necessarily need to uh be involved since i'm pretty much on a low level you are you are right there you know i'm pretty much on a low level as far as uh
sw4831B-ms98-a-0010 94.698500 105.784750 uh the company is concerned but i i do kind of like to know what's going on and what's happening and i think i can be a better and more effective employee if if i had a little bit more information along that line
sw4831B-ms98-a-0011 105.784750 108.870875 [silence]

sw4831B-ms98-a-0029 246.431875 251.456250 i know it it seem to be kind of kind of scary you know because you think of um
sw4831B-ms98-a-0030 251.456250 257.673750 see my son's eighteen right now and he he's uh he wants to go into engineering
sw4831B-ms98-a-0031 257.673750 266.397625 and the the the branches of engineering that he wants to go into is now is kind of open and he's interested in basically three different areas but
sw4831B-ms98-a-0032 266.397625 277.817375 uh it's difficult for me to [noise] to try to give him any kind of advice or to advise him or anything like that he needs to do his own course investigation and and see what he can do because who knows what's going to happen in another thirty years
sw4831B-ms98-a-0033 277.817375 290.608125 and in thirty years it becomes pretty critical i mean my um brother-in-law is like um i mean he's sixty he's not ready to retire but his company is is c[losing]- is um is uh closing up
sw4831B-ms98-a-0034 290.608125 300.290000 and because of the defense cutbacks and all that kind of stuff and all the nuclear and stuff which is what he what he was working on he's getting cut back and he's not ready to reti[re]-
