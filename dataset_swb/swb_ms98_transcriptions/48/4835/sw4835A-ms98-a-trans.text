sw4835A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.578875 [noise]
sw4835A-ms98-a-0002 0.578875 3.173000 well what's your opinion on capital punishment
sw4835A-ms98-a-0003 3.173000 18.806125 [silence]
sw4835A-ms98-a-0004 18.806125 27.426750 ri[ght]- i agree with that too i uh th[is]- this is probably going to be not a big debate or anything [laughter] uh 
sw4835A-ms98-a-0005 27.426750 37.423375 i am for capital [cu/punishment] punishment only for murder i mean you know i think they asked in the recording uh w[hat]- i[n]- in what crimes but only 
sw4835A-ms98-a-0006 37.423375 49.335500 if someone has murdered someone you know that's about the only thing but uh how is Georgia for uh capital punishment are they executing people or 
sw4835A-ms98-a-0007 49.335500 57.908375 [silence]
sw4835A-ms98-a-0008 57.908375 59.164875 what
sw4835A-ms98-a-0009 59.164875 63.430250 well needless to say Texas is uh probably the leader
sw4835A-ms98-a-0010 63.430250 73.673500 uh i we may have started you know capital punishment back up again and uh i think we've probably executed more people than any other state
sw4835A-ms98-a-0011 73.673500 75.605375 but uh
sw4835A-ms98-a-0012 75.605375 85.636000 a case out in California what was it a week or so ago was rather interesting in how that uh they prolonged the guy that was supposed to be executed
sw4835A-ms98-a-0013 85.636000 93.363500 and i just i can't see any real value in just letting these people live out their sentences
sw4835A-ms98-a-0014 93.363500 107.527750 [silence]
sw4835A-ms98-a-0015 107.527750 110.061250 um-hum and 
sw4835A-ms98-a-0016 110.061250 111.729375 [silence]
sw4835A-ms98-a-0017 111.729375 114.265625 how do you feel about insanity pleas
sw4835A-ms98-a-0018 114.265625 157.088875 [silence]
sw4835A-ms98-a-0019 157.088875 158.427875 um-hum 
sw4835A-ms98-a-0020 158.427875 164.534250 [silence]
sw4835A-ms98-a-0021 164.534250 173.918500 well i had heard of a case out in California of someone who had murdered his parents or some sort of thing and they put him away uh
sw4835A-ms98-a-0022 173.918500 184.004250 in an insane asylum you know because he pleaded insanity and after he was in maybe twelve years or so they let him out he went out and he killed five more people 
sw4835A-ms98-a-0023 184.004250 185.385125 so
sw4835A-ms98-a-0024 185.385125 189.983000 [silence]
sw4835A-ms98-a-0025 189.983000 200.158750 well i guess it's sounds rather heartless but i guess if they're that bad if they're that badly off mentally then perhaps it's just as well to to end their life
sw4835A-ms98-a-0026 200.158750 203.055750 aren't we cruel people [laughter]
sw4835A-ms98-a-0027 203.055750 206.468375 [laughter] 
sw4835A-ms98-a-0028 206.468375 217.317000 [silence]
sw4835A-ms98-a-0029 217.317000 221.351500 [laughter]
sw4835A-ms98-a-0030 221.351500 225.449000 [silence]
sw4835A-ms98-a-0031 225.449000 230.542625 well i s[ay]- they may say it's not a deterrent and perhaps it isn't but i guess 
sw4835A-ms98-a-0032 230.542625 240.513750 i just feel if nothing else it's justice i know that if someone murdered a member of my family i'd want justice done and i'd want to see them punished for their crime
sw4835A-ms98-a-0033 240.513750 241.721500 so
sw4835A-ms98-a-0034 241.721500 243.737375 [silence]
sw4835A-ms98-a-0035 243.737375 252.561500 uh perhaps the people in the Middle East have kind of a good idea you know if you steal something they cut off your hand and and the punishment fits the crime 
sw4835A-ms98-a-0036 252.561500 254.211250 but uh [laughter] 
sw4835A-ms98-a-0037 254.211250 256.339125 [silence]
sw4835A-ms98-a-0038 256.339125 259.974375 [laughter]
sw4835A-ms98-a-0039 259.974375 268.392500 [silence]
sw4835A-ms98-a-0040 268.392500 271.540625 well this is very [laughter-true] 
sw4835A-ms98-a-0041 271.540625 273.485375 [silence]
sw4835A-ms98-a-0042 273.485375 275.659375 [laughter]
sw4835A-ms98-a-0043 275.659375 278.271500 use someone as an example and see how it worked
sw4835A-ms98-a-0044 278.271500 278.899125 [laughter] 
sw4835A-ms98-a-0045 278.899125 281.761125 [silence]
sw4835A-ms98-a-0046 281.761125 288.280625 well i i was a little concerned i was going to get someone on the phone that was totally against capital punishment and
sw4835A-ms98-a-0047 288.280625 299.714000 in any conversation that i've had through this TI thing you know i've never met anybody that i got into a screaming argument with or even really disagreed with heavily but i thought this could be one you know it could be a very [noise]
