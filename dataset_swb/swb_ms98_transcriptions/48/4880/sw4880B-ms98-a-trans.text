sw4880B-ms98-a-0004 34.020000 46.246875 uh i had an ex-employer that uh the previous job i used to have uh they've after i- i guess a few years after i'd started with them they made it a condition of employment that you pass a drug test
sw4880B-ms98-a-0005 46.246875 57.275625 uh i- i don't know my feeling is that uh certain jobs that when there's uh immediate threat to life and limb um if should somebody be under the influence of drugs
