sw4880A-ms98-a-0003 14.764125 17.159500 yeah 
sw4880A-ms98-a-0004 17.159500 23.207375 which haven't changed all that much from my first reactions from from when they when they announced it but uh

sw4880A-ms98-a-0017 95.232125 99.172375 that's that's mine it it you know i- i go back it to me i[t]-
sw4880A-ms98-a-0018 99.172375 108.886875 it no matter how much the [vocalized-noise] yeah our company claims that it's not a constitutional issue that because this is uh between uh a company and an employee it is not 
sw4880A-ms98-a-0019 108.886875 112.748375 it's not a government it's not the Constitution doesn't apply but it
sw4880A-ms98-a-0020 112.748375 121.919250 [noise] it's it seems to me that it's still should i o[ur]- our company's doing it because they're a uh government contractor 
sw4880A-ms98-a-0021 121.919250 130.294250 [laughter] uh and so it's it's required for certain some form some form of 
sw4880A-ms98-a-0022 130.294250 135.559250 drug program is required to get the government contracts and i'd i'd
sw4880A-ms98-a-0023 135.559250 144.838375 i[t]- i[t]- it yes okay an[d]- and our company has taken that and gone all the way say okay uh first off
sw4880A-ms98-a-0024 144.838375 148.815250 we don't we don't have enough courage to uh
sw4880A-ms98-a-0025 148.815250 154.721375 pick out the people that that have some sort of indication of possible drug usage
sw4880A-ms98-a-0026 154.721375 162.316875 uh because_1 that would offend them uh if they if they weren't so we'll just accuse everybody of using drugs and make it all even
sw4880A-ms98-a-0027 162.316875 165.572000 uh [laughter-and] and uh
sw4880A-ms98-a-0028 165.572000 180.128875 the[n]- then uh but and they've so it's a a complete random testing we[ll]- well it's random in the sense that you don't know when it is not random in the sense that they have said that within three years everyone in the company will be tested
sw4880A-ms98-a-0029 180.128875 188.636750 um and uh you know i i sit at a terminal and and write software all day it it uh
sw4880A-ms98-a-0030 188.636750 193.353500 certainly [laughter-ha[s]-] has no life threatening uh capabilities uh
sw4880A-ms98-a-0031 193.353500 199.853500 you know in in my job and and uh yes i i agree that there are there are um
sw4880A-ms98-a-0032 199.853500 208.785875 [vocalized-noise] jobs that are definitely life threatening and and and th[ere]- there needs to be a line drawn somewhere at [wea[sonable]-/reasonable] reasonable and proper it you know 
sw4880A-ms98-a-0033 208.785875 221.245250 [silence]
sw4880A-ms98-a-0034 221.245250 222.810375 well
sw4880A-ms98-a-0035 222.810375 229.587250 yeah i that that i that i will give credit to to our our company for in that that
sw4880A-ms98-a-0036 229.587250 236.127500 [vocalized-noise] i think there's there's a a couple of levels of tests in terms of of uh
sw4880A-ms98-a-0037 236.127500 247.297625 of drugs and [vocalized-noise] essentially the first thing is tha[t]- is on the order of you dunk litmus paper in the in the urine and and or some you know it's not quite that simple but it's fairly simple
sw4880A-ms98-a-0038 247.297625 251.509750 ye[ah]- o[f]- coarse kind of test and then there's a a much more um
sw4880A-ms98-a-0039 251.509750 254.281750 uh refined test uh
sw4880A-ms98-a-0040 254.281750 265.853875 uh spectrography or wh[at]- whatever it's called they chromato[graphy]- chromatography uh to determine exactly what the what the things are and uh
sw4880A-ms98-a-0041 265.853875 271.313375 [silence]
sw4880A-ms98-a-0042 271.313375 277.410125 no i i've been with this company for uh for sixteen years now and uh

sw4880A-ms98-a-0045 288.106625 298.722000 at that time i could justify it in terms of someone new coming in you don't you don't know but on the other hand uh someone new coming in that knows they're gonna have a test that's that's
