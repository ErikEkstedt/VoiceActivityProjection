sw4823B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.085625 [noise]
sw4823B-ms98-a-0002 1.085625 24.707500 [silence]
sw4823B-ms98-a-0003 24.707500 30.757125 yeah well i think we may have the know[ledge]- knowledge of the history but certainly not any understanding of the history
sw4823B-ms98-a-0004 30.757125 31.816125 uh
sw4823B-ms98-a-0005 31.816125 37.795000 we seem to be you know doing the same we've done in many other cases which is sticking our noses in where it doesn't belong
sw4823B-ms98-a-0006 37.795000 40.137125 and i think it's you know motivated
sw4823B-ms98-a-0007 40.137125 45.055750 you know clearly by the fact of the resources that are controlled by the region which is
sw4823B-ms98-a-0008 45.055750 46.134625 [silence]
sw4823B-ms98-a-0009 46.134625 52.554875 of the you know used up in the next twenty to fifty years there won't any o[il]- any oil left i'm sure
sw4823B-ms98-a-0010 52.554875 67.790750 [silence]
sw4823B-ms98-a-0011 67.790750 68.868750 um
sw4823B-ms98-a-0012 68.868750 84.294250 [silence]
sw4823B-ms98-a-0013 84.294250 85.314750 yeah
sw4823B-ms98-a-0014 85.314750 96.485875 [silence]
sw4823B-ms98-a-0015 96.485875 99.568125 yeah well [vocalized-noise] probably from there is that the
sw4823B-ms98-a-0016 99.568125 104.235500 same problem as anywhere else anytime you take something away from somebody and give it to somebody else
sw4823B-ms98-a-0017 104.235500 110.078500 that you [vocalized-noise] didn't own in the first place there's you know going to be problems i mean that's basically what's happened i mean
sw4823B-ms98-a-0018 110.078500 116.011375 basically a handful of nations took away from Palestinians what was their homeland and gave it to the Isra[elis]- you know to the Israelis
sw4823B-ms98-a-0019 116.011375 119.719250 and you know it's not the way to go about any kind of uh
sw4823B-ms98-a-0020 119.719250 125.228375 solution that's ever going to be workable you know i mean y[ou]- neither party was consulted [laughter-up] front
sw4823B-ms98-a-0021 125.228375 141.696375 [silence]
sw4823B-ms98-a-0022 141.696375 142.724000 hum
sw4823B-ms98-a-0023 142.724000 160.282875 [silence]
sw4823B-ms98-a-0024 160.282875 161.634625 yeah
sw4823B-ms98-a-0025 161.634625 168.102625 well it's pretty scary anybody if you think about i mean an[y]- any time you get fundamentalists you know whatever nature
sw4823B-ms98-a-0026 168.102625 174.764500 and in power anywhere i mean th[ey're]- they're pure fanatics and there's that you know fundamentally no way to deal with a fanatic
sw4823B-ms98-a-0027 174.764500 178.566750 and you can't argue with them on any sort of logical or emotional basis
sw4823B-ms98-a-0028 178.566750 183.200625 a fanatic will believe in X Y Z and you're never going to change that
sw4823B-ms98-a-0029 183.200625 185.040375 you know so you might as well not even try
sw4823B-ms98-a-0030 185.040375 192.495000 [silence]
sw4823B-ms98-a-0031 192.495000 193.808500 um-hum
sw4823B-ms98-a-0032 193.808500 224.558625 [silence]
sw4823B-ms98-a-0033 224.558625 226.175000 um-hum
sw4823B-ms98-a-0034 226.175000 235.837125 [silence]
sw4823B-ms98-a-0035 235.837125 237.250000 yeah
sw4823B-ms98-a-0036 237.250000 251.216000 [silence]
sw4823B-ms98-a-0037 251.216000 254.572750 yeah i think a lot of it is is just rejection of the current
sw4823B-ms98-a-0038 254.572750 264.123500 you know power structure and that power structure happens to be religiously aligned and aligned with uh you know a religious based monarchy in a lot of those countries
sw4823B-ms98-a-0039 264.123500 272.884500 and that they're basically rejecting that power structure in favor of another which is you know return to a fundamentalist thing i mean it's not to unlike what happened in the United States
sw4823B-ms98-a-0040 272.884500 278.634375 over the last ten years i mean basically people rejected you know there's [vocalized-noise] fundamentalist you know movement
sw4823B-ms98-a-0041 278.634375 283.033750 wasn't quite as severe or as you know fanatically radical i mean because the
sw4823B-ms98-a-0042 283.033750 284.148250 uh
sw4823B-ms98-a-0043 284.148250 287.422125 the class structure is is you know less
sw4823B-ms98-a-0044 287.422125 291.566750 prolific here or less you know regionally defined here and uh
sw4823B-ms98-a-0045 291.566750 299.298000 the uh the differences aren't so so strong as in say talking about like Saudi we're you've got you know uh basically a ruling
