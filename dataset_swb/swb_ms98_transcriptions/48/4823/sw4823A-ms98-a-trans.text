sw4823A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 7.861500 i think that the middle east is of all the uh regions of the world the most volatile that we seem to be getting ourselves involved in
sw4823A-ms98-a-0002 7.861500 9.876250 and uh
sw4823A-ms98-a-0003 9.876250 13.555750 i'm not sure we're doing so with
sw4823A-ms98-a-0004 13.555750 25.377250 sufficient knowledge about the history of the area and um with what uh the people there expect i think we're just getting ourselves into a barrel of trouble [laughter]
sw4823A-ms98-a-0005 25.377250 30.117625 [silence]
sw4823A-ms98-a-0006 30.117625 31.456000 [noise]

sw4823A-ms98-a-0010 44.711625 47.536250 oh clearly yes and um
sw4823A-ms98-a-0011 47.536250 49.315750 [silence]
sw4823A-ms98-a-0012 49.315750 50.129250 hum

sw4823A-ms98-a-0014 52.817125 53.274750 [noise]
sw4823A-ms98-a-0015 53.274750 63.661625 well i feel that as far as US policy's been concerned while i understand um a position in allied um friendship with Israel
sw4823A-ms98-a-0016 63.661625 75.779750 i think that we've applied a lot of double standards in the legion uh in the past as far as dealing with the Arabs versus dealing with the Israelis and the expectations that we put on the
sw4823A-ms98-a-0017 75.779750 84.838375 uh Arab nations uh while basically succumbing to a very powerful Israeli lobby in this country
sw4823A-ms98-a-0018 84.838375 92.070625 and i- i think that the Palestinian question is a key to a lot of problems in the region
sw4823A-ms98-a-0019 92.070625 96.097125 and i don't think that this country's handled that well at all
sw4823A-ms98-a-0020 96.097125 103.774625 [silence]
sw4823A-ms98-a-0021 103.774625 105.078375 um-hum
sw4823A-ms98-a-0022 105.078375 107.671125 [silence]
sw4823A-ms98-a-0023 107.671125 109.143750 yeah

sw4823A-ms98-a-0028 123.795250 125.507375 [vocalized-noise]
sw4823A-ms98-a-0029 125.507375 136.743625 yeah i kind of anticipate that because you know we set the stage and how we've dealt with that issue in such a poor manner by basically you know
sw4823A-ms98-a-0030 136.743625 141.767250 paying lip service to the Palestinians in the past
sw4823A-ms98-a-0031 141.767250 151.860625 uh i think that's up the stage for the end effect to for this uh uh revolution of Islamic fundamentalism what seems to be sweeping
sw4823A-ms98-a-0032 151.860625 160.881000 definitely through North Africa and uh within parts of the Middle East as well something which terrifies the moderate Arab states [laughter]
sw4823A-ms98-a-0033 160.881000 162.480125 uh
sw4823A-ms98-a-0034 162.480125 167.491500 [silence]

sw4823A-ms98-a-0041 182.476375 183.565500 yeah
sw4823A-ms98-a-0042 183.565500 184.585625 [silence]
sw4823A-ms98-a-0043 184.585625 192.911750 i suspect that we'll probably in uh with the demise of the Soviet Union formation of Russia whatever ends up coming out of that
sw4823A-ms98-a-0044 192.911750 199.221500 that probably the biggest problems we're going to have in foreign policy are going to have Middle East in the future
sw4823A-ms98-a-0045 199.221500 209.018125 i think that we're going to continue to see a lot more fundamentalist influence in the area it's been spawning for a long time
sw4823A-ms98-a-0046 209.018125 218.795375 the more moderate states uh even including Saudi Arabia which is a very religious country Islamic wise it's not allowed the fundamentalist to gain control
sw4823A-ms98-a-0047 218.795375 224.965125 but uh i you know Tunisia and uh now we have problems with Sudan
sw4823A-ms98-a-0048 224.965125 236.533625 and uh these places i think that you know we're just in the beginning here of uh what will probably sweep through i mean Egypt's suffering the same kinds of problems with fundamentalism right now
sw4823A-ms98-a-0049 236.533625 246.652625 the more nations that join with this kind of uh thinking in government the more stronger uh difficulty we're going to have
sw4823A-ms98-a-0050 246.652625 251.629375 as a nation in dealing with the region because of our past experiences with the Palestinians
