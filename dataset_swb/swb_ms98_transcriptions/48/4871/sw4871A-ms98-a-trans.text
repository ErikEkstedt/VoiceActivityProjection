sw4871A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 6.090250 [noise] opinion on uh domestic or our policy towards uh Latin America is that
sw4871A-ms98-a-0002 6.090250 9.957375 especially during the Reagan now Bush administrations
sw4871A-ms98-a-0003 9.957375 18.768250 we seem to have a double standard in place over um how we treat them countries down there for example
sw4871A-ms98-a-0004 18.768250 29.124875 a left wing regime or communist regime is God awful and uh basically uh you know Satan incarnate
sw4871A-ms98-a-0005 29.124875 37.275875 while nations like for a long time uh El Salvador and uh uh Guatemala
sw4871A-ms98-a-0006 37.275875 46.647000 w[ith]- with right wing regimes we kind of just winked at things like death squads and alike yeah we found Nicaragua to be the most horrible thing in the earth
sw4871A-ms98-a-0007 46.647000 55.444625 and i just felt and it's the same thing with Cuba that we we really seem to have this kind of double standard down there
sw4871A-ms98-a-0008 55.444625 61.328375 whereas if your regime doesn't want to bother us a reason of threat to us we'll kind of ignore you
sw4871A-ms98-a-0009 61.328375 66.457625 you can do whatever you want but if you invite the commies in you know look out
sw4871A-ms98-a-0010 66.457625 103.499375 [silence]
sw4871A-ms98-a-0011 103.499375 104.834125 um-hum
sw4871A-ms98-a-0012 104.834125 135.159750 [silence]
sw4871A-ms98-a-0013 135.159750 137.154625 you wouldn't want them_1 in
sw4871A-ms98-a-0014 137.154625 145.509375 yeah yeah it's like Guate[mala]- how many Guatemalan and El Salvador refugees have we seen and heard about in the last ten years
sw4871A-ms98-a-0015 145.509375 152.413875 yet Nicaraguan refugees for the longest time were welcome with open arms as escapees and
sw4871A-ms98-a-0016 152.413875 158.797125 and and any communist type of regime down there i mean the whole the whole farce in Granada
sw4871A-ms98-a-0017 158.797125 160.892250 [laughter-right] was it just
sw4871A-ms98-a-0018 160.892250 170.626000 [laughter] i mean it was the most ridiculous thing and this is the kind of policy that we have down there i mean then we have this fake drug war [laughter]
sw4871A-ms98-a-0019 170.626000 178.481750 down there and that seems to be well we'll give you aid but oh no not to feed your people no we want you to clean up
sw4871A-ms98-a-0020 178.481750 184.519625 uh our drug problem for us here's some money go shoot people with it you know [laughter]
sw4871A-ms98-a-0021 184.519625 187.941125 [silence]
sw4871A-ms98-a-0022 187.941125 190.136500 [vocalized-noise]
sw4871A-ms98-a-0023 190.136500 199.659625 [silence]
sw4871A-ms98-a-0024 199.659625 200.712000 [laughter]
sw4871A-ms98-a-0025 200.712000 207.031875 [silence]
sw4871A-ms98-a-0026 207.031875 211.901500 well it's the same thing that happened with Iraq for years and years
sw4871A-ms98-a-0027 211.901500 221.163375 here we are sending money over here playing these people off of each other it's was same thing in Iraq playing Saddam Hussein o[ff]- off you know off of Iran
sw4871A-ms98-a-0028 221.163375 229.685250 in this case Panama off of Nicaragua and uh Cuba and any of the other left wing regimes down there
sw4871A-ms98-a-0029 229.685250 239.867750 here we are giving them all this money and they're crooks and then when they don't do something that's suitable to our particular policy we have to go and invade them [laughter]
sw4871A-ms98-a-0030 239.867750 244.180000 and for what what does it leave us with absolutely nothing
sw4871A-ms98-a-0031 244.180000 246.891750 i mean it wouldn't surprise me
sw4871A-ms98-a-0032 246.891750 257.972875 it wouldn't have surprised me if uh Noriega got off on all of the charges that you know instead of being [laughter-found] guilty and then let him go just isn't we're an embarrassment you know [laughter]
sw4871A-ms98-a-0033 257.972875 268.656375 and and i just think you know we have this kind of short term we are not interested in developing the region unless there's big business involved and wants to get involved down there
sw4871A-ms98-a-0034 268.656375 274.585625 we we tend to treat them as sort of like a backyard and you know i'm just [vocalized-noise] just like Mexico
sw4871A-ms98-a-0035 274.585625 292.382250 [silence]
sw4871A-ms98-a-0036 292.382250 293.695500 yep
