sw4859B-ms98-a-0018 99.060125 106.721625 yeah a lot of my information comes from several sources probably pretty high up on the list is National Public Radio
sw4859B-ms98-a-0019 106.721625 119.837500 um which i like um i i think it's fairly objective and i always like the letters that they read which tend to accuse them of being too liberal and too conservative
sw4859B-ms98-a-0020 119.837500 126.587375 and while there's an inherent um filtering process going on just by the letters they choose to read
sw4859B-ms98-a-0021 126.587375 139.141500 um i always figure it's a good thing when any given group is being accused by each side of um favoring the other side that's that's potential indication of balance and generally i really do believe they are pretty balanced um
sw4859B-ms98-a-0022 139.141500 145.084000 i also read Time magazine and we get one of the daily newspapers uh around here where
sw4859B-ms98-a-0023 145.084000 152.843875 we go through various sections of the uh various uh of the articles and the the front section and uh

sw4859B-ms98-a-0029 166.812375 177.629375 yeah we we get the Mercury which i generally think is actually a pretty good newspaper a[nd]- the newspaper i've really been impressed with when i've read it at times i[s]- at well the Los Angeles Times
sw4859B-ms98-a-0030 177.629375 186.137500 which i've found to be a [noise] a r[eally]- a very good quality um newspaper and i like a lot of the articles there th[e]- the other thing when you said [vocalized-noise] we don't have cable TV
sw4859B-ms98-a-0031 186.137500 193.908375 so but the other thing that you referred to that always sounds really interesting to me is is it called C-SPAN

sw4859B-ms98-a-0049 277.760375 285.794625 i i have seen that and uh a[side]- aside from the level of wit which is much higher than generally in American politics um
sw4859B-ms98-a-0050 285.794625 300.066000 which i really enjoy i really like the fact that they have a chance to ask hard real questions i think and it's unlike the fairly controlled uh press conferences that Presidents of the United States have here where they they always seem
