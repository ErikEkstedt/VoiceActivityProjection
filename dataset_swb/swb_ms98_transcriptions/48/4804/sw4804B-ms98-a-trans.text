sw4804B-ms98-a-0013 49.207250 51.430500 the budget i stuck on the most
sw4804B-ms98-a-0014 51.430500 57.415625 was the the budget i was on the most was what was called the ten twenty seventy budget
sw4804B-ms98-a-0015 57.415625 61.414625 and basically ten percent of your income goes to uh
sw4804B-ms98-a-0016 61.414625 64.086875 uh long-term savings
sw4804B-ms98-a-0017 64.086875 66.229375 twenty percent goes toward
sw4804B-ms98-a-0018 66.229375 70.449250 uh basically short-term you know doing going out to dinner
sw4804B-ms98-a-0019 70.449250 79.252750 like going to the movies uh maybe you know saving that part up toward like going on you know so[mething]- something a l[ittle]- little more short-term than like the long-term budget
sw4804B-ms98-a-0020 79.252750 89.377500 and then the o[ther]- and then seventy percent goes toward uh uh you know paying debts and and and that kind of stuff with the whole idea being that you pay yourself first you're more likely to stick with it
sw4804B-ms98-a-0021 89.377500 98.350750 [silence]
sw4804B-ms98-a-0022 98.350750 99.433750 hm

sw4804B-ms98-a-0024 110.076000 111.463500 sure
sw4804B-ms98-a-0025 111.463500 117.970000 [silence]
sw4804B-ms98-a-0026 117.970000 121.454375 uh i will be a week from next Monday
sw4804B-ms98-a-0027 121.454375 123.937125 [silence]
sw4804B-ms98-a-0028 123.937125 125.467875 no not really
sw4804B-ms98-a-0029 125.467875 127.372250 [silence]
sw4804B-ms98-a-0030 127.372250 133.051500 yeah yeah so far for now i think uh i mean for now we've still got our own money really
sw4804B-ms98-a-0031 133.051500 134.438875 uh
sw4804B-ms98-a-0032 134.438875 140.612375 and that'll probably it'll probably be that way till uh you know we like buy our own house together or something
sw4804B-ms98-a-0033 140.612375 144.519500 in which case you know it's very convenient to once again throw everything together
sw4804B-ms98-a-0034 144.519500 146.081250 uh
sw4804B-ms98-a-0035 146.081250 155.623375 [silence]
sw4804B-ms98-a-0036 155.623375 157.876250 right right
sw4804B-ms98-a-0037 157.876250 160.903125 [silence]
sw4804B-ms98-a-0038 160.903125 166.138750 yeah a[nd]- and right now in my case it's more situation that uh that she uh
sw4804B-ms98-a-0039 166.138750 168.858500 uh has still got a lot of debt
sw4804B-ms98-a-0040 168.858500 171.785625 and it's easier for me to kind of like just shoulder
sw4804B-ms98-a-0041 171.785625 173.425375 the normal stuff
sw4804B-ms98-a-0042 173.425375 175.882250 and let her concentrate on getting herself out of debt
sw4804B-ms98-a-0043 175.882250 178.541875 [silence]
sw4804B-ms98-a-0044 178.541875 180.240875 [laughter]
sw4804B-ms98-a-0045 180.240875 187.666625 well i was the year before and that was the last time i really got on a budget was to really fight being in debt because_1 i didn't like it
sw4804B-ms98-a-0046 187.666625 189.416625 [silence]
sw4804B-ms98-a-0047 189.416625 190.466375 so
sw4804B-ms98-a-0048 190.466375 191.439500 [laughter]
sw4804B-ms98-a-0049 191.439500 193.237250 i think it's people in general
sw4804B-ms98-a-0050 193.237250 196.987375 yeah you have a tendenc[y]- that's a tendency to do it when you can
sw4804B-ms98-a-0051 196.987375 198.446625 uh
sw4804B-ms98-a-0052 198.446625 204.085375 one of the ways i insure my long-term savings is the fact that you know i've got a 401K plan so i've got
sw4804B-ms98-a-0053 204.085375 209.180250 uh five percent of my income going into that uh that's actually five percent before taxes
sw4804B-ms98-a-0054 209.180250 213.564000 uh that cou[ld]- you know so that's even more and then i've also uh
sw4804B-ms98-a-0055 213.564000 217.509875 uh you know got a few other miscellaneous automatic deductions
sw4804B-ms98-a-0056 217.509875 218.497125 yeah
sw4804B-ms98-a-0057 218.497125 224.996000 [silence]

sw4804B-ms98-a-0060 232.926625 240.484750 right well i've i've even got a uh fifty dollar a month uh uh mutual fund automatic transfer on the twentieth of every month
sw4804B-ms98-a-0061 240.484750 244.101625 you know once again you know you know it's there you know it's going to happen
sw4804B-ms98-a-0062 244.101625 245.586625 it's a uh
sw4804B-ms98-a-0063 245.586625 247.622000 an easier way to uh
sw4804B-ms98-a-0064 247.622000 248.800625 to save
sw4804B-ms98-a-0065 248.800625 257.481375 [silence]
sw4804B-ms98-a-0066 257.481375 259.471125 no she has no saying [laughter]

sw4804B-ms98-a-0070 264.901625 271.517750 well sure you know you know like you said for right now we really kind of each have our own money which is maybe a weird way to do your budgeting but
sw4804B-ms98-a-0071 271.517750 279.083625 i i think until you know we're we're both growing [vocalized-noise] because you know of that i think it'll probably stay away for awhile
