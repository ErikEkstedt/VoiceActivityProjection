sw4804A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 3.414625 [noise] he uh well do you use a budget
sw4804A-ms98-a-0002 3.414625 8.979500 [silence]
sw4804A-ms98-a-0003 8.979500 13.942875 any particular reason uh that you get off of it or does it seem to work for you
sw4804A-ms98-a-0004 13.942875 22.938000 [silence]
sw4804A-ms98-a-0005 22.938000 24.507625 yeah
sw4804A-ms98-a-0006 24.507625 29.267250 [silence]
sw4804A-ms98-a-0007 29.267250 31.831625 and you do stick by it when you do it huh
sw4804A-ms98-a-0008 31.831625 33.018000 [laughter]
sw4804A-ms98-a-0009 33.018000 44.443375 well i tend to have a monthly budget and basically what it is i list all my income coming in and the expenses and whatever's left over i spend
sw4804A-ms98-a-0010 44.443375 46.711625 you know i just [laughter]
sw4804A-ms98-a-0011 46.711625 49.311250 that just kind of seems to be the way it works
sw4804A-ms98-a-0012 49.311250 51.168500 [silence]
sw4804A-ms98-a-0013 51.168500 52.698250 pardon me
sw4804A-ms98-a-0014 52.698250 56.934000 [silence]
sw4804A-ms98-a-0015 56.934000 58.488125 and
sw4804A-ms98-a-0016 58.488125 63.355875 [silence]
sw4804A-ms98-a-0017 63.355875 64.819000 um-hum
sw4804A-ms98-a-0018 64.819000 89.269875 [silence]
sw4804A-ms98-a-0019 89.269875 98.986375 yes and i know th[at]- that theory unfortunately neither i'm marr[ied]- married and neither my husband or myself have the greatest amount of self-control in the world
sw4804A-ms98-a-0020 98.986375 110.577125 and uh so that makes it pretty easy not to stick with the budget at times you know instead of thinking oh we'll save it this month we'll think well oh gee we'll buy this lamp or this whatever you know
sw4804A-ms98-a-0021 110.577125 116.522125 so uh our s[avings]- our savings plan sometimes goes down the drain
sw4804A-ms98-a-0022 116.522125 118.613875 but are you married
sw4804A-ms98-a-0023 118.613875 120.651750 [silence]
sw4804A-ms98-a-0024 120.651750 124.570750 oh do you think this is going to change the way you budget your money in any way
sw4804A-ms98-a-0025 124.570750 128.047000 have you kind of discussed this already with your fiancee
sw4804A-ms98-a-0026 128.047000 139.890625 [silence]
sw4804A-ms98-a-0027 139.890625 141.142125 uh-huh
sw4804A-ms98-a-0028 141.142125 144.882750 [silence]
sw4804A-ms98-a-0029 144.882750 148.352875 well i agree it's uh
sw4804A-ms98-a-0030 148.352875 157.436875 maybe for us anyway it's easier just to to put it all in one big pot and not worry about who makes what or who you know who donates what to it
sw4804A-ms98-a-0031 157.436875 161.883500 but uh but we just kind of started out that way and
sw4804A-ms98-a-0032 161.883500 169.105125 [silence]
sw4804A-ms98-a-0033 169.105125 170.158875 oh
sw4804A-ms98-a-0034 170.158875 172.837875 [silence]
sw4804A-ms98-a-0035 172.837875 174.094875 uh-huh
sw4804A-ms98-a-0036 174.094875 175.146375 [silence]
sw4804A-ms98-a-0037 175.146375 181.589375 well that's a good idea do you think this is true of all women i seem to have been in debt when my husband and i got married [laughter-too]
sw4804A-ms98-a-0038 181.589375 187.987625 [silence]
sw4804A-ms98-a-0039 187.987625 189.956625 uh no it's not a whole lot of fun
sw4804A-ms98-a-0040 189.956625 205.841375 [silence]
sw4804A-ms98-a-0041 205.841375 207.191375 um-hum
sw4804A-ms98-a-0042 207.191375 208.473625 [silence]
sw4804A-ms98-a-0043 208.473625 209.743000 um-hum
sw4804A-ms98-a-0044 209.743000 217.156375 [silence]
sw4804A-ms98-a-0045 217.156375 225.114750 which i think is really the easiest way to save because once you have the money in your hand in the check you'll think oh well i just won't put anything
sw4804A-ms98-a-0046 225.114750 233.587875 or you know even if it's of course most of us are direct deposit anymore anyway i'm sure but once it goes into the checking account it's awfully hard to transfer it over
sw4804A-ms98-a-0047 233.587875 239.387500 [silence]
sw4804A-ms98-a-0048 239.387500 241.234750 that's a good idea
sw4804A-ms98-a-0049 241.234750 248.852875 [silence]
sw4804A-ms98-a-0050 248.852875 249.999125 um-hum
sw4804A-ms98-a-0051 249.999125 258.378375 and uh your fiancee i[s]- she'll she goes along with the savings part too even though uh she's managed to get herself into debt
sw4804A-ms98-a-0052 258.378375 262.242875 [laughter]
sw4804A-ms98-a-0053 262.242875 264.994250 [laughter] but you're going to manage to make her stick to your plan right 
sw4804A-ms98-a-0054 264.994250 266.874125 [laughter]
sw4804A-ms98-a-0055 266.874125 268.331875 [silence]
sw4804A-ms98-a-0056 268.331875 269.607375 um-hum
sw4804A-ms98-a-0057 269.607375 278.607375 [silence]
sw4804A-ms98-a-0058 278.607375 290.379625 well actually i know some people a a girlfriend of mine who was married probably about three three or four years ago and they still have separate checking accounts that's the way they prefer it uh
sw4804A-ms98-a-0059 290.379625 298.402000 you know uh she doesn't go into detail as to why they prefer it that way or anything but it's everybody as long as i think uh your
