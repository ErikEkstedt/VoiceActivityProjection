sw4834B-ms98-a-0034 234.182375 246.295750 um if the purchase was m[ade]- made mail order they should have a record of where it was shipped to and since it wasn't shipped to her address she could prove you know that it wasn't her um
sw4834B-ms98-a-0035 246.295750 258.454625 if it was so[me]- you know coming into the store and stuff then she would of ha[d]- whoever made the purchase would have ha[d]- sign some kind of um you know document and uh wh[o]-
sw4834B-ms98-a-0036 258.454625 270.220500 the signature um they should be able to provide you a copy with that signature and if they can't provide a signature uh you know they'll they have to eat the [laughter-charge]
sw4834B-ms98-a-0037 270.220500 278.902750 but if the pers[on]- has had their social se[curity]- her social security number i'd be real concerned that they uh
sw4834B-ms98-a-0038 278.902750 286.657375 that she's not uh blacklist on uh Tel[ecredit]- what is it it's [Telecreder/Telecredit] something um 
sw4834B-ms98-a-0039 286.657375 297.164000 because_1 she won't be able to cash checks because_1 most places verify through there she probably won't be ab[le]- able to open a checking account or anything without a lot of hassle
