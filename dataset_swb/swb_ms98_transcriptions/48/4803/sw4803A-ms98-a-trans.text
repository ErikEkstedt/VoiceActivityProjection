sw4803A-ms98-a-0003 10.578000 18.082625 uh i don't know why the post people post office people pay one third out of their paycheck for the same insurance that we're getting 
sw4803A-ms98-a-0004 18.082625 23.205250 uh right now i'm in we're physicians health plan and that costs about thirty five bucks a paycheck 
sw4803A-ms98-a-0005 23.205250 26.807250 but yet the postal people will only pay less than ten dollars a paycheck 
sw4803A-ms98-a-0006 26.807250 27.814125 [silence]

sw4803A-ms98-a-0016 132.423750 142.828750 i agree there because_1 i you know Saturday afternoon you're playing baseball and you break your arm you don't know what it's going to cost you for the x-rays and everything else like that if you don't have some type of health plan that you can afford 
sw4803A-ms98-a-0017 142.828750 151.208875 and i'm sure there's a lot of people that live paycheck to paycheck to where they cannot [vocalized-noise] and afford fifty bucks every paycheck for a health insurance plan 
sw4803A-ms98-a-0018 151.208875 161.468000 and i know i and when i was in Germany i was in the service but at the same time there was an agreement that if you went to a hospital there in Germany that they knew they could bill uncle Sam for that hospital care 
sw4803A-ms98-a-0019 161.468000 165.416875 so they didn't give us any hassle [vocalized-noise] medical care there
