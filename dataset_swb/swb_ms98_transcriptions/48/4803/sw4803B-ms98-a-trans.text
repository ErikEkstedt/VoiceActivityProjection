sw4803B-ms98-a-0009 34.889750 35.621625 well 
sw4803B-ms98-a-0010 35.621625 36.645000 [silence] 
sw4803B-ms98-a-0011 36.645000 44.535875 i am all for universal health insurance um being up here in New York um 
sw4803B-ms98-a-0012 44.535875 49.589750 our local Blue Cross Blue Shield people have 
sw4803B-ms98-a-0013 49.589750 57.496250 i'm i'm now paying every month because i'm self-employed one hundred and three dollars a month 
sw4803B-ms98-a-0014 57.496250 60.096250 for basic health care coverage 
sw4803B-ms98-a-0015 60.096250 64.848500 um actually i'm sorry it's more than th[at]- well it's four hundred dollars a quarter 
sw4803B-ms98-a-0016 64.848500 65.205875 [noise] 
sw4803B-ms98-a-0017 65.205875 67.915375 so it's probably a little more than that 
sw4803B-ms98-a-0018 67.915375 69.403125 and 
sw4803B-ms98-a-0019 69.403125 69.824750 [noise] 
sw4803B-ms98-a-0020 69.824750 81.324500 frankly i don't i think that if we can take what's been done in Canada and given every body a choice as far as who they want for their health care 
sw4803B-ms98-a-0021 81.324500 88.516375 frankly i think that the reason that we're in so much trouble and and and it's such an {anticompetitive} um 
sw4803B-ms98-a-0022 88.516375 101.204125 uh stance right now as far as doing battle with these other companies is that we are really burdening our American corporations with health care costs which they have to build in to the price of their product 
sw4803B-ms98-a-0023 101.204125 107.577375 whereas if you go to so[me]- one of these overseas countries Japan for example where the government pays all of that 
sw4803B-ms98-a-0024 107.577375 115.008250 the you don't have to build that in to the cost of the product um they usually nail the pr[oduct]- you know you pay as as an individual 
sw4803B-ms98-a-0025 115.008250 122.497125 versus um having a company dragged down by these insane health care costs 
sw4803B-ms98-a-0026 122.497125 132.137500 and i think that we should have a health care system in this country that everybody can get access to and uh have it universal

sw4803B-ms98-a-0032 175.849000 186.123625 yeah yeah i you know i- i wouldn't even mind so much if they had a um corporation that is financed 
sw4803B-ms98-a-0033 186.123625 198.378500 through the government or have some sort of there can be competition as long as there is a universal plan i don't opp[ose]- i do not i'm not for eliminating all private health insurance whatsoever 
sw4803B-ms98-a-0034 198.378500 203.153500 but um you know but if if you have the ability to pay 
sw4803B-ms98-a-0035 203.153500 208.198000 for that you can pay based on your income as a percentage 
sw4803B-ms98-a-0036 208.198000 214.113000 and uh more fairly and equitably distribute the cost across a wide spectrum right now 
sw4803B-ms98-a-0037 214.113000 221.422750 you know the people working this country is half the problem right there and we're seeing that's not a lot of it is private sector too 
sw4803B-ms98-a-0038 221.422750 228.086250 um i you know it's the government is always attacked for not being able to do anything properly 
sw4803B-ms98-a-0039 228.086250 232.387875 this is one example i don't think the private sector's doing much better though 
sw4803B-ms98-a-0040 232.387875 237.296750 [silence] 
sw4803B-ms98-a-0041 237.296750 244.478750 i get a credit this year and last year because the government specifically said i could get a credit 
sw4803B-ms98-a-0042 244.478750 254.343750 but the uh but it is it's going to expire which means i'm paying uh i get a sum a sum uh sum of the money back 
sw4803B-ms98-a-0043 254.343750 257.726000 but um not all of it of course um 
sw4803B-ms98-a-0044 257.726000 265.338125 i'm in a worst off position than someone who is employed who gets their health health care taken care of by their employer 
sw4803B-ms98-a-0045 265.338125 272.807500 um because i have to also obtain my insurance from is a third party middle man type deal 
sw4803B-ms98-a-0046 272.807500 278.851625 i have to go to go the small business service bureau and pay eighty dollars a year just for the right to buy health insurance 
sw4803B-ms98-a-0047 278.851625 280.107000 [laughter] 
sw4803B-ms98-a-0048 280.107000 282.774125 works well for them but it's horrible for me 
sw4803B-ms98-a-0049 282.774125 287.266000 [silence] 
sw4803B-ms98-a-0050 287.266000 288.714000 yeah i- i- i- i 
sw4803B-ms98-a-0051 288.714000 289.725125 [silence] 
sw4803B-ms98-a-0052 289.725125 295.521625 you just can't it's just it's sky rocketing i mean we're seeing increases every year ten to fifteen percent 
sw4803B-ms98-a-0053 295.521625 299.522000 and you know it's it's gotten way out of hand and the[n]- and then you have these [vocalized-noise]
