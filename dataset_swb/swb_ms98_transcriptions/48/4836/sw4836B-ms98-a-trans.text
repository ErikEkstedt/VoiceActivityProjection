sw4836B-ms98-a-0027 154.440250 160.269250 we're supposed to be getting a fifteen hundred minicomputer pretty soon
sw4836B-ms98-a-0028 160.269250 163.034750 replace our 990 huh
sw4836B-ms98-a-0029 163.034750 169.888500 uh no it's a TI made 1500 it's a a minicomputer
sw4836B-ms98-a-0030 169.888500 175.902750 uh it's a newer version of the nine ninety which is one they had
sw4836B-ms98-a-0031 175.902750 181.036375 it uses uh Unix as one of the operating systems

sw4836B-ms98-a-0033 182.465250 183.773000 but uh

sw4836B-ms98-a-0045 239.037750 248.986125 [silence]
sw4836B-ms98-a-0046 248.986125 258.494000 that's like i learned uh DFM and PFM you know Professional File Manager which is can be used as a word processor it doesn't
sw4836B-ms98-a-0047 258.494000 263.688875 it does everything i need moves splits you know all that but uh
sw4836B-ms98-a-0048 263.688875 270.109000 doesn't have some of the little fancy stuff like underline caps bol[d]- i mean bold and all that so
sw4836B-ms98-a-0049 270.109000 276.370750 uh that's other than that it's you know perfectly suitable for most things i do
sw4836B-ms98-a-0050 276.370750 286.479250 [silence]
