sw4836A-ms98-a-0002 2.610500 12.445625 okay [noise] personal interests in computers basically nowadays it seems like you can't get by without one everywhere i go it's got some kind of computer interface like pressing on keyboards
sw4836A-ms98-a-0003 12.445625 20.214625 uh pressing in personal identification numbers all the ATM machines things like that i personally don't own one because i can't afford one
sw4836A-ms98-a-0004 20.214625 31.516375 uh every time you look in a friend's houses and they show you their computers and all the knickknacks they have it seems like they go from their basic computer to all these peripheral devices like uh modems and
sw4836A-ms98-a-0005 31.516375 43.435625 fancy printers or [lazy/laser] printers and fax machines and games that they like to play course i i was impressed by some of the games they have like flight [simular/simulator] game simulator for the different aircraft

sw4836A-ms98-a-0007 51.915000 54.251250 very close to it i understand
sw4836A-ms98-a-0008 54.251250 57.035500 except for the bouncing around it
sw4836A-ms98-a-0009 57.035500 66.830750 [silence]
sw4836A-ms98-a-0010 66.830750 72.730250 [noise] you using it mostly for spreadsheets or do you use it for like word processing

sw4836A-ms98-a-0012 116.363875 122.601250 yeah i use a Z248 286 at work but it's basically to tie into the communications network
sw4836A-ms98-a-0013 122.601250 127.354250 then through our communications network we go to our mainframe on the base there
sw4836A-ms98-a-0014 127.354250 130.686750 and use the Unix operating systems
sw4836A-ms98-a-0015 130.686750 135.386500 use their VI editor and we use um read on line news through it
sw4836A-ms98-a-0016 135.386500 140.200625 and we also have terminal emulations through IBM thirty two seventy eight
sw4836A-ms98-a-0017 140.200625 147.985250 and [noise] i don't know i just don't i don't even use the hard disk drive to to copy any floppy disks or anything like that i just basically use it for a
sw4836A-ms98-a-0018 147.985250 151.419750 a window into there to the Unix world
sw4836A-ms98-a-0019 151.419750 159.822875 [silence]
sw4836A-ms98-a-0020 159.822875 163.992000 uh is that IBM or is that an IBM type

sw4836A-ms98-a-0022 185.467250 195.448375 i'm familiar with Unix commands like um copying files and compressing them_1 things like that i just have a fun time using their mainframe at the base but
sw4836A-ms98-a-0023 195.448375 203.305500 [silence]
sw4836A-ms98-a-0024 203.305500 208.257125 [laughter] it's like a different language all right

sw4836A-ms98-a-0026 215.265500 221.241500 [noise] yeah we can use System Five or we can use um C shell
sw4836A-ms98-a-0027 221.241500 224.933375 you know i like um i favor C shell over the other
sw4836A-ms98-a-0028 224.933375 231.000000 i think i think most of our users like Bourne shell because_1 they were trained in it and they just don't wanna learn something different
sw4836A-ms98-a-0029 231.000000 233.317750 [silence]
sw4836A-ms98-a-0030 233.317750 234.931375 pardon

sw4836A-ms98-a-0032 238.250625 243.596500 oh yeah plus everybody in your office knows it and as the new people come in they kind of help each other out
sw4836A-ms98-a-0033 243.596500 250.603125 but you have different people with different backgrounds and they have a hard time sharing information [noise]

sw4836A-ms98-a-0035 275.032250 287.189750 [noise] yeah the dis[advantage]- disadvantage of VI editor you can't see all those fancy things [noise] i have another thing called Q-Office from Quadratron back in California that people like to use but it's a very slow system
sw4836A-ms98-a-0036 287.189750 291.128125 and i understand it's only on like we use a Gold 9050
sw4836A-ms98-a-0037 291.128125 297.922000 and that's basically their format they use for word processing and they're trying to push people into using either WordP[erfect]-
