sw4829B-ms98-a-0006 35.240125 45.837625 [silence]
sw4829B-ms98-a-0007 45.837625 50.141125 how do you uh how uh is recycling done in your community is
sw4829B-ms98-a-0008 50.141125 51.586500 [silence]
sw4829B-ms98-a-0009 51.586500 52.805250 uh-huh
sw4829B-ms98-a-0010 52.805250 60.263250 [silence]
sw4829B-ms98-a-0011 60.263250 61.552250 uh-huh
sw4829B-ms98-a-0012 61.552250 62.589500 [silence]
sw4829B-ms98-a-0013 62.589500 63.840000 right
sw4829B-ms98-a-0014 63.840000 76.761500 [silence]
sw4829B-ms98-a-0015 76.761500 78.266125 oh
sw4829B-ms98-a-0016 78.266125 88.424500 right over here they um have several private companies that you can take uh recycled materials to
sw4829B-ms98-a-0017 88.424500 100.389375 but um if you want to take them all to one place they have uh the first Saturday of every month they have certain places that you can drop them_1 off that's what i do um 
sw4829B-ms98-a-0018 100.389375 105.077375 and i i recycle aluminum glass
sw4829B-ms98-a-0019 105.077375 107.012125 um
sw4829B-ms98-a-0020 107.012125 109.871750 newspapers
sw4829B-ms98-a-0021 109.871750 118.341375 so it's nice to have you know one place that you can take them all to instead of driving the glass to one place and
sw4829B-ms98-a-0022 118.341375 120.252875 right
sw4829B-ms98-a-0023 120.252875 132.295750 right so it's so that's nice it would be it would be really nice if they uh came to the house to pick it up and they just were talking about a bill in Tucson about that but uh
sw4829B-ms98-a-0024 132.295750 134.931375 uh it didn't go through
sw4829B-ms98-a-0025 134.931375 136.525625 so
sw4829B-ms98-a-0026 136.525625 145.033250 [silence]
sw4829B-ms98-a-0027 145.033250 149.374000 right i guess what they what they were talking about here was um
sw4829B-ms98-a-0028 149.374000 157.174250 was reducing the garbage collection in order to make that up or something you know um
sw4829B-ms98-a-0029 157.174250 159.686375 so i guess that's one option
sw4829B-ms98-a-0030 159.686375 161.477750 [silence]
sw4829B-ms98-a-0031 161.477750 166.401250 i guess one thing they're working on now is recycling plastics too like um
sw4829B-ms98-a-0032 166.401250 174.397125 have you noticed that on the bottom of plastic goods they have this little number now that tells what kind of plastic it is
sw4829B-ms98-a-0033 174.397125 183.667375 yeah i guess the problem with plastic is there's so many different kinds that you can't recycle you can't just throw all plastic into one recycler
sw4829B-ms98-a-0034 183.667375 193.829000 yeah so now they're like marking um they're i don't know there's six seven eight different kind of plastics and they they mark on the bottom what kind it is
sw4829B-ms98-a-0035 193.829000 197.231625 so i guess that makes it easy to recycle and then they're
sw4829B-ms98-a-0036 197.231625 209.041250 they're um trying to make plastic goods that don't have a bunch of different plastics in them you know that are that are only made out of one kind of plastic so that that makes it easier i guess
sw4829B-ms98-a-0037 209.041250 218.829250 [silence]
sw4829B-ms98-a-0038 218.829250 220.112750 right
sw4829B-ms98-a-0039 220.112750 225.390000 [silence]
sw4829B-ms98-a-0040 225.390000 228.046000 where does your friend go to recycle
sw4829B-ms98-a-0041 228.046000 237.035750 [silence]
sw4829B-ms98-a-0042 237.035750 238.301125 uh-huh
sw4829B-ms98-a-0043 238.301125 241.730000 [silence]
sw4829B-ms98-a-0044 241.730000 243.024500 yeah

sw4829B-ms98-a-0047 250.443875 251.956375 [silence]
sw4829B-ms98-a-0048 251.956375 258.626750 i guess that's how it gets passed on you know when one person you hear it from another person and then uh
sw4829B-ms98-a-0049 258.626750 265.519500 and then you and then you pass it on so it seems to be catching on uh
sw4829B-ms98-a-0050 265.519500 268.404625 slowly but surely i guess [laughter]
sw4829B-ms98-a-0051 268.404625 277.996000 [silence]
sw4829B-ms98-a-0052 277.996000 279.280250 uh-huh
