sw4829A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 8.982750 [noise] okay um [noise] let me see unfortunately we are not much recycling [laughter] we don't we don't do enough i know we don't so
sw4829A-ms98-a-0002 8.982750 15.840625 uh although uh lately i've been uh a friend of mine that i spend a lot of time with 
sw4829A-ms98-a-0003 15.840625 27.072625 does recycle quite a bit and it's it it's uh [laughter-interesting] to watch some of the things that she does and then she's almost had an impact on me um 
sw4829A-ms98-a-0004 27.072625 37.836375 where [noise] she doesn't say anything to me when she comes to my house but i- i can kind of tell it bothers her so uh just unconsciously i've i've stopped buying a lot of um
sw4829A-ms98-a-0005 37.836375 46.357625 um paper plates and paper cups and i don't do that anymore i don't know why i just [laughter-don't] [laughter-i] [laughter-just] from just from socializing with her so

sw4829A-ms98-a-0007 49.517375 57.443250 it really it there's not a whole lot there really isn't uh i know in my mother's neighborhood in San Antonio each
sw4829A-ms98-a-0008 57.443250 62.957375 each house ha[s]- they're they're given three baskets and they put them_1 out on a certain day of the week
sw4829A-ms98-a-0009 62.957375 73.324250 and each uh home does participate but we really don't have anything uh close in this area that that do anything and and some of the communities that do
sw4829A-ms98-a-0010 73.324250 79.226500 the residents are having to pay to participate in it which really doesn't make sense
