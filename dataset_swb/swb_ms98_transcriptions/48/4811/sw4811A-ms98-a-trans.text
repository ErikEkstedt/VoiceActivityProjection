sw4811A-ms98-a-0019 64.457375 73.787875 [silence]
sw4811A-ms98-a-0020 73.787875 75.529625 that's true

sw4811A-ms98-a-0022 82.385625 87.968000 isn't there some sort of deal where you can continue your benefits for eighteen months
sw4811A-ms98-a-0023 87.968000 93.012500 [silence]

sw4811A-ms98-a-0031 125.033875 127.986875 [silence]
sw4811A-ms98-a-0032 127.986875 134.490000 i think that well i think the whole thing with this health insurance being so high is because people are
sw4811A-ms98-a-0033 134.490000 138.454875 suing left and right and just driving these costs up
sw4811A-ms98-a-0034 138.454875 143.572000 [silence]
sw4811A-ms98-a-0035 143.572000 147.937250 well i- i have my own beef about health insurance i uh
sw4811A-ms98-a-0036 147.937250 154.143375 i'm not a spring chicken [laughter-myself] quite frankly um i raised a family and
sw4811A-ms98-a-0037 154.143375 163.767375 now i'd like to get back into my field which is teaching and it's at a time where school budgets are so far down that they're firing experienced people
sw4811A-ms98-a-0038 163.767375 171.426625 and also you know i'm i'm a art teacher which is a very small field out of a whole school there's two or three
sw4811A-ms98-a-0039 171.426625 181.407875 and you know there are two hundred [apliplations/applications] for one one job uh you send in a resume and th[ey]- they don't even write a letter to you to say no thanks which
sw4811A-ms98-a-0040 181.407875 193.723625 yeah i suppose and um i do substitute teach and my biggest complaint is schools get a discount insurance school districts because they have so many people
sw4811A-ms98-a-0041 193.723625 204.771750 why can't they allow their substitutes to buy into it to pay ourselves just to get the lower rate that a group would have and they won't let us
sw4811A-ms98-a-0042 204.771750 207.954625 yeah they don't let you do it
sw4811A-ms98-a-0043 207.954625 212.535500 uh um i don't know i don't know
sw4811A-ms98-a-0044 212.535500 215.438875 i just i just know it's not allowed 
sw4811A-ms98-a-0045 215.438875 219.652875 yeah uh no not th[ey]- they didn't get that far 
sw4811A-ms98-a-0046 219.652875 222.817000 no because we we do we don't do this 
sw4811A-ms98-a-0047 222.817000 236.695500 we don't do this and everybody thinks it's sort of a crying shame i have been divorced and i knew that uh when i was divorced i was allowed that eighteen months of insurance on my ex-husband's plan and i was allowed to pay for myself
sw4811A-ms98-a-0048 236.695500 244.404125 at their lower rate and i don't see what the school district would have to lose by letting us pay for ourselves but
sw4811A-ms98-a-0049 244.404125 246.551125 [silence]
sw4811A-ms98-a-0050 246.551125 251.115250 well i they're paying all the premium for their full-time teachers
sw4811A-ms98-a-0051 251.115250 254.423750 yeah yeah that's part of their salary
sw4811A-ms98-a-0052 254.423750 256.062250 [silence]
sw4811A-ms98-a-0053 256.062250 257.737500 yeah
sw4811A-ms98-a-0054 257.737500 261.190875 no no it's just not policy
sw4811A-ms98-a-0055 261.190875 263.955000 yeah that just doesn't seem to make any sense
sw4811A-ms98-a-0056 263.955000 272.032125 well i am remarried now and my husband um quit his job to try some consulting he's an engineer
sw4811A-ms98-a-0057 272.032125 285.390625 and what he did was he j[oined]- you know if you join a group sometimes it's a little less he joined the Engineer's Society or some group like that and what he did which was actually very clever most people want to have
sw4811A-ms98-a-0058 285.390625 293.121125 the lowest deductible and then get eighty percent of their money back and all of this my husband said why don't we take a five hundred dollar deductible
sw4811A-ms98-a-0059 293.121125 298.082000 if we have a little you know annual checkup here or there we can pay that that's not the prob[lem]-
