sw4811B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 2.878375 [silence]
sw4811B-ms98-a-0002 2.878375 7.755125 i do but uh they're pretty slanted i want you to know [laughter]
sw4811B-ms98-a-0003 7.755125 11.722500 [laughter] uh my company was bought by another company
sw4811B-ms98-a-0004 11.722500 14.482500 and the majority of us were laid off
sw4811B-ms98-a-0005 14.482500 15.939375 [silence]
sw4811B-ms98-a-0006 15.939375 19.299000 uh-huh so you know uh what i would like to see
sw4811B-ms98-a-0007 19.299000 23.425250 well uh the really sad part of this is that i'm fifty five years old 
sw4811B-ms98-a-0008 23.425250 24.507125 and
sw4811B-ms98-a-0009 24.507125 26.384000 beg your pardon
sw4811B-ms98-a-0010 26.384000 30.372375 oh my chances of getting another job are just really slim
sw4811B-ms98-a-0011 30.372375 33.633000 i was a systems analyst for an oil company
sw4811B-ms98-a-0012 33.633000 42.686500 and you know they just i mean Sprint had uh two thousand jobs open i mean i'm sorry two hundred jobs open they had two thousand applications
sw4811B-ms98-a-0013 42.686500 51.478875 for this type of work you know it's just uh and i guess that's that's pretty far-fetched as benefits go
sw4811B-ms98-a-0014 51.478875 57.891625 but gosh you know i saw it i was fixed for life [laughter] so uh
sw4811B-ms98-a-0015 57.891625 63.080875 [silence]
sw4811B-ms98-a-0016 63.080875 65.762750 it really is it really is
sw4811B-ms98-a-0017 65.762750 74.244000 but uh i- i think uh i guess my feelings on this are that the one of the most important benefits we currently have is our health insurance
sw4811B-ms98-a-0018 74.244000 78.763000 and that if there were some way to get that to follow you from job to job
sw4811B-ms98-a-0019 78.763000 82.914000 or so that you would not lose it if you have to leave a company
sw4811B-ms98-a-0020 82.914000 86.859375 [silence]
sw4811B-ms98-a-0021 86.859375 93.488750 there is uh-huh and and that's fine but you know i'm still unemployed after about fourteen months okay
sw4811B-ms98-a-0022 93.488750 99.206125 and when you switch yeah when you switch over the the premiums are really quite high
sw4811B-ms98-a-0023 99.206125 101.662875 and additionally i've had a heart attack
sw4811B-ms98-a-0024 101.662875 112.852250 so it's going to be really tough for me to do this so you know uh in in my very personal way i feel that insurance is just one of the most important benefits we have now
sw4811B-ms98-a-0025 112.852250 117.697875 now with the poli[tical]- political situation the way it is i think that's going to change
sw4811B-ms98-a-0026 117.697875 119.014250 [silence]
sw4811B-ms98-a-0027 119.014250 120.469625 because
sw4811B-ms98-a-0028 120.469625 123.703375 i think we're going to have to have something of that sort
sw4811B-ms98-a-0029 123.703375 128.138125 so that will cease to be as important a benefit
sw4811B-ms98-a-0030 128.138125 131.099125 what are your feelings what what do you feel 
sw4811B-ms98-a-0031 131.099125 137.883000 [silence]
sw4811B-ms98-a-0032 137.883000 143.964500 well i agree with you but do you know that's that's what makes this such a tremendous benefit if you can possible get group rates
sw4811B-ms98-a-0033 143.964500 149.247000 [silence]
sw4811B-ms98-a-0034 149.247000 151.026125 [laughter]
