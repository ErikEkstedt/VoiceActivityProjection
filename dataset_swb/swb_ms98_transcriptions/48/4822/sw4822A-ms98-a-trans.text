sw4822A-ms98-a-0013 42.523625 44.545500 um-hum sure
sw4822A-ms98-a-0014 44.545500 46.520125 [silence]
sw4822A-ms98-a-0015 46.520125 47.982250 well that's good
sw4822A-ms98-a-0016 47.982250 56.171000 because_1 sometimes i wonder you know being a uh lay person out there of not uh knowing ex[actly]- exactly what's going on in space
sw4822A-ms98-a-0017 56.171000 67.625625 whether you know they're going ahead and doing things and whether or not we're spending too much money on the programs and not spending enough money on the earth that we have here being you know
sw4822A-ms98-a-0018 67.625625 76.377250 to me th[e]- all this uh space exploration that we've done thus far has told us that there's no other place like earth
sw4822A-ms98-a-0019 76.377250 90.710625 that uh we can't live on Mars we can't live here we can't live there i mean this is the the place that we have to live i mean there's uh no other resource for us to to look at other than here so it's kind of like
sw4822A-ms98-a-0020 90.710625 97.879250 to me i would like to see a lot more money being put toward taking care of the environment that we have here
sw4822A-ms98-a-0021 97.879250 106.396000 and not so much emphasis put on what's going out in space and what i[t]- you know not that i want everything to halt and
sw4822A-ms98-a-0022 106.396000 114.189750 let's forget about the space program or whatever because we're always curious and we always need to know more things but um
sw4822A-ms98-a-0023 114.189750 124.886750 it to me it's kind of like let's try and clean up the air that we have here let's try to take care of the lakes that are getting polluted and the other things that are going on here
sw4822A-ms98-a-0024 124.886750 132.761500 mainly because uh the space program has taught us that there is no other place for [noise] us i mean this is it i mean if we would've
sw4822A-ms98-a-0025 132.761500 140.881250 uh if we would have went into space and found Mars a livable pl[anet]- uh planet we probably would have inhabited it and uh
sw4822A-ms98-a-0026 140.881250 148.656125 you know who would have cared about earth it would have been another planet to kind of take over and uh continue on so you know and that
sw4822A-ms98-a-0027 148.656125 156.863500 when i look at the space program itself i think of it you know as being in terms of it's it's interesting to learn but it's also
sw4822A-ms98-a-0028 156.863500 163.461625 it's it brings down the fact that this earth is it it's it for us you know what i mean
sw4822A-ms98-a-0029 163.461625 169.256125 um unless technology makes the decision that we all are going to live in space or whatever but
sw4822A-ms98-a-0030 169.256125 176.286750 i would love to um go into the space shuttle some day and uh just see um
sw4822A-ms98-a-0031 176.286750 186.338250 you know the earth and the different planets and things like that i i think it would be very interesting to do but whether it'd be feasible to do i don't know
sw4822A-ms98-a-0032 186.338250 194.412875 [silence]
sw4822A-ms98-a-0033 194.412875 195.868000 um-hum

sw4822A-ms98-a-0041 212.681250 214.266250 um-hum
sw4822A-ms98-a-0042 214.266250 216.961750 exactly yeah that's true
sw4822A-ms98-a-0043 216.961750 226.649750 you know and uh i think of uh i i'm sure you probably have heard of the Genesis program that's going on currently out in the Arizona desert uh
sw4822A-ms98-a-0044 226.649750 231.891375 there's uh you know they're trying to look at how things effect everything in trying to create
sw4822A-ms98-a-0045 231.891375 245.809000 you know an environment where they have an ocean and they have the lakes and then they have the desert part of it and then they have an area that's more um you know full of uh vegetation tropicals that kind of thing to kind of uh
sw4822A-ms98-a-0046 245.809000 257.084750 look at things and say you know the environment wise this is where we're living but what what effects it and how can we improve it and things like that and i i think in space um
sw4822A-ms98-a-0047 257.084750 262.713000 i don't know how many people could live up in space uh for any [laughter-length] [laughter-of] [laughter-time] i mean i
sw4822A-ms98-a-0048 262.713000 270.020125 just the way that we're affected by when it's cloudy out and it's cloudy for days and we don't see the sun
sw4822A-ms98-a-0049 270.020125 283.206000 and the people their moods are extreme you know it's like God if i don't get to see the sun i'm gonna be in this bad mood all this entire time i mean this is how i see people reacting you know when is the sun gonna come out
sw4822A-ms98-a-0050 283.206000 289.593375 so i wonder how you know somebody living up in space is going to be able to tolerate never seeing the [laughter-sun]
sw4822A-ms98-a-0051 289.593375 298.562000 you know in the aspect that we see it uh and never seeing uh you know light bright days you know and uh brea[thing]-
