sw4840B-ms98-a-0002 1.034875 6.387875 [silence]
sw4840B-ms98-a-0003 6.387875 13.136625 well let's see um i haven't gotten mine yet because my parents are getting all that stuff at um at home in the Bay area
sw4840B-ms98-a-0004 13.136625 19.932625 so i'm not sure how much i'm getting back but i'm pretty sure should get back a little bit since i'm still a student so not too much
sw4840B-ms98-a-0005 19.932625 21.625750 not too bad though
sw4840B-ms98-a-0006 21.625750 34.715250 [silence]
sw4840B-ms98-a-0007 34.715250 42.130875 yeah it it's one of [noise] those necessities of life that we all have to you know pay taxes but uh although it is kind of a pain sometimes though
sw4840B-ms98-a-0008 42.130875 47.509250 [silence]
sw4840B-ms98-a-0009 47.509250 48.826250 um-hum
sw4840B-ms98-a-0010 48.826250 50.299000 [silence]
sw4840B-ms98-a-0011 50.299000 51.562750 uh-huh
sw4840B-ms98-a-0012 51.562750 59.737125 [silence]
sw4840B-ms98-a-0013 59.737125 73.820375 yeah and and like as as time goes on you know things get more expensive and because we're [vocalized-noise] we're increasingly complex society that day by day things get more um things get more expensive as well as more complex
sw4840B-ms98-a-0014 73.820375 79.810375 and you know taxes are one of the ways that help pay for a lot of the things that are needed in this society
sw4840B-ms98-a-0015 79.810375 94.251500 i mean everything from you know from Medicare to um to Social Security to um to feeding the ho[meless]- to um to you know feeding the homeless to uh maintaining prisons to maintaining polices or fire departments and things like that
sw4840B-ms98-a-0016 94.251500 99.217125 and it's now there's more and more things that need attending to and that sort of thing and
sw4840B-ms98-a-0017 99.217125 105.546875 you know it's it's becoming a a large responsibility but s[omeone]- someone has to pay for it and that's us
sw4840B-ms98-a-0018 105.546875 133.386625 [silence]
sw4840B-ms98-a-0019 133.386625 134.479125 um-hum
sw4840B-ms98-a-0020 134.479125 137.783000 [silence]
sw4840B-ms98-a-0021 137.783000 150.575250 yeah and and even even today it's like you know there's still a considerable amount of taxes that you know we're paying for but you'd think that we're still in thi[s]- this this uh deficit state that we're still not able to pay off things just because
sw4840B-ms98-a-0022 150.575250 153.408500 the budget's not big enough as it is
sw4840B-ms98-a-0023 153.408500 161.169375 and makes you wonder when there's [vocalized-noise] you know uh countries out there that have you know tax rates also like close to fifty percent or higher 
sw4840B-ms98-a-0024 161.169375 169.363125 you know it's like fifty percent of everything you make is already gone before you can get it and that that's kind of a scary thought and i hope it doesn't come down to that
sw4840B-ms98-a-0025 169.363125 171.006750 [silence]
sw4840B-ms98-a-0026 171.006750 181.751000 but on the other hand they also whi[le]- while those countries that have high taxes also have things like um like socialized medicine and things like that too which are nice fringe benefits of it
sw4840B-ms98-a-0027 181.751000 192.558000 so everyone has everyone has the access to medical facilities as well as the doctors that sort of thing and it's good but it's it's the price they pay [laughter]
sw4840B-ms98-a-0028 192.558000 205.081000 i mean it it can be argued one way or another whether the economically it's actually good for the country or good for any given country to have that because tho[se]- those countries tend to be um as far as cash flow a a lot
sw4840B-ms98-a-0029 205.081000 211.591500 um have a be tend to have a much slower cash flow and don't try and generate a larger um
sw4840B-ms98-a-0030 211.591500 218.802125 a large amount of revenue because there's so little um currency flow through out the economic system
sw4840B-ms98-a-0031 218.802125 223.275000 [silence]
sw4840B-ms98-a-0032 223.275000 226.143375 uh just keeping up with the times that's all
sw4840B-ms98-a-0033 226.143375 235.292375 as i[t]- as it turns out you know it's one of those one of those interests that you know i kind of like to keep up on because_1 well it's nice to know that when i'm actually you know i do start working that
sw4840B-ms98-a-0034 235.292375 243.002625 i'll like to know like where my tax dollars are going too [vocalized-noise] i work hard to to get you know i like to know where it's going to 
sw4840B-ms98-a-0035 243.002625 246.070875 [silence]
sw4840B-ms98-a-0036 246.070875 247.316875 um-hum
sw4840B-ms98-a-0037 247.316875 253.015750 [silence]
sw4840B-ms98-a-0038 253.015750 265.565375 i think in a in a way it's good in a way it's not um but i think in general it's probably good i mean a lot of things like tobacco and alcohol and things like that have been have been in the past
sw4840B-ms98-a-0039 265.565375 274.145500 um have been not taxed because there's been such a large lobby against them against the taxes for them you know sponsored by alcohol and tobacco companies
sw4840B-ms98-a-0040 274.145500 283.191000 and it's things like tobacco are um they're they're a proven health hazard to smokers as well as nonsmokers
sw4840B-ms98-a-0041 283.191000 292.608500 and it's as far as a safety thing in like in San Luis Obispo for example there's an ordinance which states that um there's no smoking in any public areas
sw4840B-ms98-a-0042 292.608500 297.640875 and so if you walk into any restaurant or any hotel there's no smoking allowed anywhere
sw4840B-ms98-a-0043 297.640875 298.850000 um-hum
