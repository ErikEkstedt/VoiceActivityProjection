sw4812A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 2.566000 so how do you feel about it
sw4812A-ms98-a-0002 2.566000 6.317875 [silence]
sw4812A-ms98-a-0003 6.317875 13.154250 yeah i- i myself almost um am in favor of it uh
sw4812A-ms98-a-0004 13.154250 22.271875 i work at Honeywell and i went through a a pretty i don't know i went through a standard drug testing thing before i i was brought on
sw4812A-ms98-a-0005 22.271875 28.651250 i think that's pretty standard at least at Honeywell it is um i think it's important to insure the quality and
sw4812A-ms98-a-0006 28.651250 30.884125 and uh
sw4812A-ms98-a-0007 30.884125 37.097625 i don't know almost the goodness of character you know and that kind of thing where do you work
sw4812A-ms98-a-0008 37.097625 39.437125 [silence]
sw4812A-ms98-a-0009 39.437125 42.214750 oh okay oh okay
sw4812A-ms98-a-0010 42.214750 43.702750 [silence]
sw4812A-ms98-a-0011 43.702750 44.878625 hm
sw4812A-ms98-a-0012 44.878625 45.882625 [silence]
sw4812A-ms98-a-0013 45.882625 47.460750 oh great
sw4812A-ms98-a-0014 47.460750 55.108875 [silence]
sw4812A-ms98-a-0015 55.108875 56.365000 right
sw4812A-ms98-a-0016 56.365000 68.755500 [silence]
sw4812A-ms98-a-0017 68.755500 70.251875 um-hum
sw4812A-ms98-a-0018 70.251875 71.715000 yeah
sw4812A-ms98-a-0019 71.715000 72.784250 [silence]
sw4812A-ms98-a-0020 72.784250 80.489000 yeah and that that definitely happens you know i mean those the drug tests assure u[s]- they're accurate but there's always that margin of error
sw4812A-ms98-a-0021 80.489000 83.657750 and that's that's something to be aware of
sw4812A-ms98-a-0022 83.657750 94.496875 another thing is a lot of times you know they aren't that accurate or they aren't that sensitive like if you're on a prescription drug of some kind you know what are they gonna do about that [laughter]
sw4812A-ms98-a-0023 94.496875 100.864625 you know i was on a couple of different prescription drugs when i was tested for Honeywell and uh
sw4812A-ms98-a-0024 100.864625 104.852625 uh you know i know they didn't catch that or else they would have said something
sw4812A-ms98-a-0025 104.852625 115.908125 um i'm sure they screen for just a particular few types although the literature they give with you says yeah we do this and then they list about five thousand drugs they try to test for
sw4812A-ms98-a-0026 115.908125 120.205500 um i don't know what what program are you in over at Carnegie Mellon
sw4812A-ms98-a-0027 120.205500 123.451500 oh okay great um
sw4812A-ms98-a-0028 123.451500 131.528250 yeah i'm a graduate student at UCF in Florida University of Central Florida and this is actually a [laughter] an internship up here
sw4812A-ms98-a-0029 131.528250 133.185375 but um
sw4812A-ms98-a-0030 133.185375 140.811125 they uh even for interns they they do the whole random drug or the whole drug testing thing so
sw4812A-ms98-a-0031 140.811125 144.134000 [silence]
sw4812A-ms98-a-0032 144.134000 145.503375 right
sw4812A-ms98-a-0033 145.503375 153.154500 um they essentially <b_aside> no i sure don't <e_aside> um they essentially um
sw4812A-ms98-a-0034 153.154500 158.821250 they essentially uh made me the offer and then and then uh
sw4812A-ms98-a-0035 158.821250 161.721250 did the drug testing thing after that
sw4812A-ms98-a-0036 161.721250 170.985875 so uh it was one of those things where you go through the the general battery of all their tests and and then they essentially give you the offer
sw4812A-ms98-a-0037 170.985875 176.262000 and then at that point they'll they'll ask you to go to a drug testing and things like that
sw4812A-ms98-a-0038 176.262000 181.417625 so uh there's some noise on this end i'm actually in a mall calling so
sw4812A-ms98-a-0039 181.417625 183.699000 [laughter] you probably wondered huh
sw4812A-ms98-a-0040 183.699000 185.134750 but so
sw4812A-ms98-a-0041 185.134750 190.032250 [silence]
sw4812A-ms98-a-0042 190.032250 201.982625 yeah that's a good question i believe from what i remember of the literature they gave uh if you fail i believe they give you one more chance they probably give you a chance to explain yourself
sw4812A-ms98-a-0043 201.982625 205.024625 and then maybe give you another chance to go through it
sw4812A-ms98-a-0044 205.024625 217.257000 but uh you know once again those things are not that accurate so there's undoubtedly a proportion of people who do fail you know but um wha[t]- are you working right now anywhere or
sw4812A-ms98-a-0045 217.257000 218.711500 okay
sw4812A-ms98-a-0046 218.711500 220.229500 [silence]
sw4812A-ms98-a-0047 220.229500 222.029875 oh okay great
sw4812A-ms98-a-0048 222.029875 223.263000 [silence]
sw4812A-ms98-a-0049 223.263000 235.554500 yeah that was the first time i'd ever gotten any kind of drug screening you know was was going to Honeywell a friend of mine is also a doctoral student down there and he's doing an internship with IBM
sw4812A-ms98-a-0050 235.554500 237.379125 and uh
sw4812A-ms98-a-0051 237.379125 252.024250 they basically uh did the same exact thing um we both got our internships at the same time and we both had to go through drug [tresting/testing] at the same time so one of those things where we went through a kind of an identical process but uh 
sw4812A-ms98-a-0052 252.024250 253.521750 [silence]
sw4812A-ms98-a-0053 253.521750 264.664625 no no that's one thing they don't do is is drug testing while you're on the job uh i think i think the unwritten rule is yeah expect it but they don't do it
sw4812A-ms98-a-0054 264.664625 266.350375 you know so
sw4812A-ms98-a-0055 266.350375 269.357750 that's good i guess i don't know i mean
sw4812A-ms98-a-0056 269.357750 270.843875 [silence]
sw4812A-ms98-a-0057 270.843875 272.524625 i uh
sw4812A-ms98-a-0058 272.524625 281.371250 i have gone to a couple of parties since since that time and while i don't do any drugs myself i've seen some people who work there um
sw4812A-ms98-a-0059 281.371250 285.480375 you know smoking a joint or whatever and uh
sw4812A-ms98-a-0060 285.480375 288.683375 you know that's the kind of thing that would definitely come up
sw4812A-ms98-a-0061 288.683375 290.252125 you know but
sw4812A-ms98-a-0062 290.252125 292.977000 no they don't they don't really do that
sw4812A-ms98-a-0063 292.977000 297.666875 [silence]
sw4812A-ms98-a-0064 297.666875 298.562000 yeah
