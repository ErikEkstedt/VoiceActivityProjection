sw4874B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.070125 [noise]
sw4874B-ms98-a-0002 1.070125 17.917500 [silence]
sw4874B-ms98-a-0003 17.917500 28.331375 yeah i my main concern right now is first of all at this point with the current government and situation i don't see them as any threat
sw4874B-ms98-a-0004 28.331375 41.165375 to us at the moment however with the current state of the central government being as um tenuous as it is it wouldn't take much to uh cause a kind of fascist revival
sw4874B-ms98-a-0005 41.165375 50.784750 within uh Russia or any of the republics and then we do have a real clear foreign policy and a a problem and a threat
sw4874B-ms98-a-0006 50.784750 58.114500 because of the number of nuclear weapons that are there we seem to have lost the ability to control what's going on in the country
sw4874B-ms98-a-0007 58.114500 65.742375 and any country which has as many nuclear weapons as they do is certainly is a threat but perhaps not at this second
sw4874B-ms98-a-0008 65.742375 81.550625 [silence]
sw4874B-ms98-a-0009 81.550625 90.459750 well i work in international radio um and uh one of the groups that we're working with has been Radio Eurovan which is in Armenia
sw4874B-ms98-a-0010 90.459750 101.631375 and i you know in a sense you'd think being a you know an American or a westerner it would make sense that w[e]- there is no real great threat that these people aren't nuts
sw4874B-ms98-a-0011 101.631375 110.828000 but you listen to the what the Armenians have to say about their neighbors the Azerbaijanis and they launch in a second if they had an access to those weapons
sw4874B-ms98-a-0012 110.828000 119.332750 there is a great deal of religious hatred in that part of the world and this is stuff that goes back to the days of Christ [laughter-i] [laughter-mean]
sw4874B-ms98-a-0013 119.332750 127.736875 this is not a two hundred year or or a fifty year uh problem this goes back centuries and the amount of hatred
sw4874B-ms98-a-0014 127.736875 133.390625 i mean there's accusations of using chemical weapons now bo[th]- on both sides and
sw4874B-ms98-a-0015 133.390625 140.884875 it into a republican strife amongst these various um former parts of the Soviet Union
sw4874B-ms98-a-0016 140.884875 147.205625 i think you could have a regional use of nuclear weapons but i don't think that they see us as a threat anymore 
sw4874B-ms98-a-0017 147.205625 148.767000 [silence]
sw4874B-ms98-a-0018 148.767000 149.794875 [noise]
sw4874B-ms98-a-0019 149.794875 159.840375 um the other concern is as time goes on they could become an economic threat um but i think what will happen is they will go through an Asian
sw4874B-ms98-a-0020 159.840375 171.038125 type of uh introduction into the business world where beginning there'll be cheap labor and uh y[ou]- you know then we will have an i'd say thirty years if things stay the way things are now
sw4874B-ms98-a-0021 171.038125 179.972500 they could become another Korea or Malaysia or Thailand type of [vocalized-noise] source for cheap labor where American products could be built
sw4874B-ms98-a-0022 179.972500 182.733125 and uh i think that's where they are headed
sw4874B-ms98-a-0023 182.733125 191.521000 [silence]
sw4874B-ms98-a-0024 191.521000 192.844500 um-hum
sw4874B-ms98-a-0025 192.844500 208.529625 [silence]
sw4874B-ms98-a-0026 208.529625 215.299000 well they do have a huge oil reserve the problem is that they don't have the ability to exploit it at this point
sw4874B-ms98-a-0027 215.299000 219.841125 they could become a major source for oil for us as well as timber
sw4874B-ms98-a-0028 219.841125 228.688125 and um other products agriculture could become very important for them using modern farming techniques in the Ukraine
sw4874B-ms98-a-0029 228.688125 236.322000 and i suspect they will form some sort of economic union when all is said and done [vocalized-noise] i don't thi[nk]- i don't think
sw4874B-ms98-a-0030 236.322000 254.823000 [silence]
sw4874B-ms98-a-0031 254.823000 266.581000 [noise] well i certainly hope that we will i- i wish we would incorporate some sort of marshall plan over there because i think one of the problems that this country has in dealing with them is we aren't doing enough right now
sw4874B-ms98-a-0032 266.581000 273.846625 and the chances for things getting out of control and another fascist type of regime rising are quite good
sw4874B-ms98-a-0033 273.846625 284.664500 um anyone at this point who can give them food security and make them you know feel some pride again could become a major threat especially some of these republics
sw4874B-ms98-a-0034 284.664500 290.280875 which are striving to become independent from central Moscow and that kind of administration
sw4874B-ms98-a-0035 290.280875 298.850000 um and if we don't get our tushes in there and spend more effort and money and funds trying to get things back on the ground there i think we're in
