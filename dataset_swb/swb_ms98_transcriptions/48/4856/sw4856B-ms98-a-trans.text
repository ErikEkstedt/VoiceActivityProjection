sw4856B-ms98-a-0002 1.049375 26.968500 [silence]
sw4856B-ms98-a-0003 26.968500 34.176125 well i don't know how much publicity it's gotten outside of the state but California we just put somebody to death
sw4856B-ms98-a-0004 34.176125 42.074250 um for i think it was a double murder uh to be honest i didn't pay that much attention uh to the details of it um
sw4856B-ms98-a-0005 42.074250 42.577750 [noise]
sw4856B-ms98-a-0006 42.577750 51.592750 but it had a lot of controversy out here uh basically because in California people like to protest about everything um
sw4856B-ms98-a-0007 51.592750 57.619250 but i agree i believe that that there are a number of crimes that capital punishment is the best way to go um
sw4856B-ms98-a-0008 57.619250 61.087125 the big disagreement i have is that
sw4856B-ms98-a-0009 61.087125 68.160625 in California the appeals process uh is so extensive and takes so long
sw4856B-ms98-a-0010 68.160625 80.201625 that you end up spending a huge amount of money in like ten to fifteen years before you can actually you know put somebody to death for for a crime
sw4856B-ms98-a-0011 80.201625 82.054125 [silence]
sw4856B-ms98-a-0012 82.054125 93.504000 and i mean that's that's ridiculous i mean if you can you know y[ou]- y[ou]- the trial is supposed to prove you know within a reasonable doubt that the person is guilty
sw4856B-ms98-a-0013 93.504000 104.703875 and then they have appeals well that's fine but it shouldn't take more than a few years i mean i should think two or three years maximum you should be able to know and you should be able to either put the guy to death
sw4856B-ms98-a-0014 104.703875 111.795000 or he's innocent i mean it's if he's guilty for for you know multiple murders or whatever the case may be you know
sw4856B-ms98-a-0015 111.795000 114.655750 [silence]
sw4856B-ms98-a-0016 114.655750 115.862125 yeah
sw4856B-ms98-a-0017 115.862125 132.155250 [silence]
sw4856B-ms98-a-0018 132.155250 146.476250 yeah he was like um the the the defense the defense they're were giving given was that uh like his mother had had been an alcoholic when when she was pregnant with him and so he he wasn't you know mentally competent or anything else
sw4856B-ms98-a-0019 146.476250 156.240875 which is ridiculous and and the court found him competent um and he knew what he was doing and everything else i mean you know it was it was the best defense they could come up with
sw4856B-ms98-a-0020 156.240875 159.403375 [silence]
sw4856B-ms98-a-0021 159.403375 163.090750 i forget i think it was something like twelve years or something
sw4856B-ms98-a-0022 163.090750 164.116375 [silence]
sw4856B-ms98-a-0023 164.116375 166.854000 it was it was something really outrageous
sw4856B-ms98-a-0024 166.854000 176.438375 [silence]
sw4856B-ms98-a-0025 176.438375 177.675625 yeah
sw4856B-ms98-a-0026 177.675625 184.241000 [silence]
sw4856B-ms98-a-0027 184.241000 187.249875 i think in general uh
sw4856B-ms98-a-0028 187.249875 195.367625 punishment in the United States is a lot weaker than it should be i mean it needs to be you know it's kind of like
sw4856B-ms98-a-0029 195.367625 205.000000 the the the justice system in the United States is kind of like the dog poops on the carpet and you wait three months and then you put his nose in it and spank him for it
sw4856B-ms98-a-0030 205.000000 209.565250 you know i mean there's there's no connection between the two
sw4856B-ms98-a-0031 209.565250 211.597375 [silence]
sw4856B-ms98-a-0032 211.597375 222.886375 i mean you take these you know most of the people who are committing violent crimes most of them_1 not all by any means but you know a large percentage are the kind of people who are living very much day to day in the first place
sw4856B-ms98-a-0033 222.886375 234.155500 um they don't really see past next week much less next year and to say you know well if i kill somebody then a decade from now i might face the punishment
sw4856B-ms98-a-0034 234.155500 237.672375 that's not real it doesn't have any real impact on them
sw4856B-ms98-a-0035 237.672375 242.480250 [silence]
sw4856B-ms98-a-0036 242.480250 245.745125 [noise] um-hum
sw4856B-ms98-a-0037 245.745125 261.531875 [silence]
sw4856B-ms98-a-0038 261.531875 266.094375 um y[ou]- you mean would he be put to death for that
sw4856B-ms98-a-0039 266.094375 270.944375 um largely depends on the circumstances and generally
sw4856B-ms98-a-0040 270.944375 278.210500 you know from what i understand it's it's only the most brutal types of things usually where it's multiple you know
sw4856B-ms98-a-0041 278.210500 285.848250 if if they can say things like you know well he was just you know temporarily insane because of some domestic squabble then
sw4856B-ms98-a-0042 285.848250 293.100500 you know they'll they'll give him you know twenty years with with parole in in twelve or something like that
sw4856B-ms98-a-0043 293.100500 300.162000 [silence]
