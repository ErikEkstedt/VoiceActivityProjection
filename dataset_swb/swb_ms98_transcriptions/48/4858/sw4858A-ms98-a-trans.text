sw4858A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 3.423125 [noise] uh i'm of the age that could have gone although i didn't and uh
sw4858A-ms98-a-0002 3.423125 8.376250 i guess um looking back on it i tend to think it was pretty uh
sw4858A-ms98-a-0003 8.376250 10.123750 mostly a mistake
sw4858A-ms98-a-0004 10.123750 11.883125 on the other hand
sw4858A-ms98-a-0005 11.883125 15.552625 um the more i learn about the history the more i see it was
sw4858A-ms98-a-0006 15.552625 20.597750 incremental uh decisions anyone of which was sort of understandable at the time
sw4858A-ms98-a-0007 20.597750 26.001875 and uh but on the whole i think it uh probably was the wrong thing to do
sw4858A-ms98-a-0008 26.001875 27.453125 how about you
sw4858A-ms98-a-0009 27.453125 35.579875 [silence]
sw4858A-ms98-a-0010 35.579875 36.828250 um-hum
sw4858A-ms98-a-0011 36.828250 39.849000 [silence]
sw4858A-ms98-a-0012 39.849000 41.247125 yeah
sw4858A-ms98-a-0013 41.247125 42.247250 [silence]
sw4858A-ms98-a-0014 42.247250 43.528500 right
sw4858A-ms98-a-0015 43.528500 53.167000 [silence]
sw4858A-ms98-a-0016 53.167000 54.970375 yeah
sw4858A-ms98-a-0017 54.970375 76.672625 [silence]
sw4858A-ms98-a-0018 76.672625 78.338875 yeah
sw4858A-ms98-a-0019 78.338875 79.703875 [silence]
sw4858A-ms98-a-0020 79.703875 80.922500 yes

sw4858A-ms98-a-0022 86.999875 88.236250 [noise]
sw4858A-ms98-a-0023 88.236250 90.969500 yeah it's funny tonight i was um
sw4858A-ms98-a-0024 90.969500 94.495750 helping my kid with an essay on uh Stalin
sw4858A-ms98-a-0025 94.495750 96.244625 and i was thinking
sw4858A-ms98-a-0026 96.244625 98.815250 in the course of talking to him about it how uh
sw4858A-ms98-a-0027 98.815250 102.793875 in World War Two the personalties of Stalin Hitler and Churchill
sw4858A-ms98-a-0028 102.793875 108.066750 more or less defined the war and actually when you think back on the big events of the war it was uh
sw4858A-ms98-a-0029 108.066750 117.005750 it was almost a personal struggle among these three uh i guess you'd have to call them great men in some sense [noise] um
sw4858A-ms98-a-0030 117.005750 124.972875 they're certainly all leaders and um and uh with their nations pretty pretty solidly behind each one of them
sw4858A-ms98-a-0031 124.972875 136.752625 and i got a feeling that some of that was involved in the uh early decisions in the Vietnam war that the uh [noise] people saw the cold war as uh you had to draw a line and and defend it
sw4858A-ms98-a-0032 136.752625 140.060000 otherwise there'd be uh they'd get you someplace else
sw4858A-ms98-a-0033 140.060000 149.121250 [noise] looking back it seems like that was only partly true that uh there might have been a better place to draw the line um
sw4858A-ms98-a-0034 149.121250 151.054500 i guess you can
sw4858A-ms98-a-0035 151.054500 157.144750 i guess you can say that a a certain amount of resolve and willingness to fight um
sw4858A-ms98-a-0036 157.144750 164.914750 brought the cold war to an end but i don't think you can just fight anywhere just just in order to um call the bully out and beat him
sw4858A-ms98-a-0037 164.914750 177.051750 and i have a feeling that that's part of what was involved in the Vietnamese war they felt like this was a place where we could draw a line beat them and they wouldn't come forward and uh we were wrong [laughter]
sw4858A-ms98-a-0038 177.051750 180.165250 but i um
sw4858A-ms98-a-0039 180.165250 183.278750 you know the like how they said the more i hear about it
sw4858A-ms98-a-0040 183.278750 193.066000 the more i can see each decision that was made as being understandable but the cumulative effect was to really get into a a hopeless situation
sw4858A-ms98-a-0041 193.066000 205.300000 where and as you say uh going halfway was probably worse than um committing um committing to a completely and um winning it whatever that would mean
sw4858A-ms98-a-0042 205.300000 216.530750 [silence]
sw4858A-ms98-a-0043 216.530750 222.098750 yeah [noise] huh yeah

sw4858A-ms98-a-0045 225.553750 226.785500 yeah

sw4858A-ms98-a-0049 243.246125 245.009250 it's ambivalent yeah
sw4858A-ms98-a-0050 245.009250 258.817875 [silence]
sw4858A-ms98-a-0051 258.817875 265.137125 what a[bout]- what about the domestic effects like [vocalized-noise] i was thinking that maybe the most important effect it had was to make it
sw4858A-ms98-a-0052 265.137125 277.597250 uh possible and even popular to um [noise] criticize the government and they that pendulum started to swing um may[be]- maybe even too far uh to the point where um
sw4858A-ms98-a-0053 277.597250 289.561250 um supporting a government decision in foreign policy was sort of optional [laughter] from the Vietnam war on and that tradition is still i mean it's dying now but it's still alive as opposed to
sw4858A-ms98-a-0054 289.561250 298.178000 this Desert Storm stuff may have uh killed it but i think that was one of the biggest that you know the uh this domestic unrest that it
