sw4858B-ms98-a-0011 69.086250 77.526500 but that they just kind of lived out in the woods and every now and then they'd go and shoot their rifles and then they'd come back and you know
sw4858B-ms98-a-0012 77.526500 89.004750 but that they weren't really allowed to do anything i uh to me it seems like we only went halfway if even halfway

sw4858B-ms98-a-0028 228.465375 238.063125 the traditional battle of kind of good versus evil if you you know whichever way it is but in in in the Vietnam war it seems like it was
sw4858B-ms98-a-0029 238.063125 243.949125 [noise] the sides and the lines that were drawn were all confused as to who's good and who's bad and
