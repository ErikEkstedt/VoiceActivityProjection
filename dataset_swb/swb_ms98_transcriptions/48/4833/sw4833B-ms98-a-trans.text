sw4833B-ms98-a-0006 39.711250 43.197625 [silence]
sw4833B-ms98-a-0007 43.197625 52.404875 well i'd have to take a slightly different thing uh viewpoint uh i'm uh thirty five uh and um
sw4833B-ms98-a-0008 52.404875 62.102250 uh uh to me it's something a little more subtle it it's just a prevalence of computer technology and uh everyday life i mean 
sw4833B-ms98-a-0009 62.102250 69.333625 i can remember when everything was still done by by han[d]- by paper by hand [laughter] as opposed to computer generated paper now [laughter]
sw4833B-ms98-a-0010 69.333625 79.448375 um you know uh befo[re]- you know when uh clerks in grocery stores uh actually had to be able to add things up and in their head and check it 
sw4833B-ms98-a-0011 79.448375 84.975000 [laughter] which is [vocalized-noise] plusses and minuses there i guess [vocalized-noise]

sw4833B-ms98-a-0015 93.523375 103.209500 and it was actually quite and art form to see some of the you know older or or more experienced cashiers go you know fly through that is like those Japanese hippies see what the abacus is still
sw4833B-ms98-a-0016 103.209500 109.904625 uh so uh maybe that's just a different viewpoint uh but uh i just
sw4833B-ms98-a-0017 109.904625 116.228750 remember everything well just writing a letter fo[r]- for work you know i mean in word processor you know we can [vocalized-noise]
sw4833B-ms98-a-0018 116.228750 125.175500 to me i can't even image now how they even produced books or letters before word processors you know then we'd have to through fifty iterations at least the way i write letters and things
