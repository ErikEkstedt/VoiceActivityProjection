sw4809A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.937250 [noise] i guess what
sw4809A-ms98-a-0002 0.937250 7.835000 this brings to mind is uh um my chief complaint is then uh
sw4809A-ms98-a-0003 7.835000 10.380625 the priority that's given to kids
sw4809A-ms98-a-0004 10.380625 11.233500 [laughter]
sw4809A-ms98-a-0005 11.233500 12.797750 that's what comes to mind anyway
sw4809A-ms98-a-0006 12.797750 13.974250 [laughter]
sw4809A-ms98-a-0007 13.974250 21.897750 well i don't know i guess uh i think one of the biggest changes that's taken place over the last twenty five years anyway is um uh
sw4809A-ms98-a-0008 21.897750 25.199250 uh both parents working and the
sw4809A-ms98-a-0009 25.199250 31.067750 the uh mechanisms haven't really been in place to get to give kids all the attention they need
sw4809A-ms98-a-0010 31.067750 34.644000 so i think that uh and i think we're sort of reaping the 
sw4809A-ms98-a-0011 34.644000 37.224000 um results of that in uh
sw4809A-ms98-a-0012 37.224000 44.907125 a lot of problems yeah i mean i don't blame people for um both going to work um both parents going to work
sw4809A-ms98-a-0013 44.907125 47.189750 [noise] it's tough not to for a lot of people
sw4809A-ms98-a-0014 47.189750 50.224375 [noise] but it's been i think that may be the single
sw4809A-ms98-a-0015 50.224375 55.244500 biggest social change in the middle class anyway that's uh that has uh
sw4809A-ms98-a-0016 55.244500 59.067500 uh had a lot more repercussion that people every thought
sw4809A-ms98-a-0017 59.067500 60.315250 um
sw4809A-ms98-a-0018 60.315250 76.949875 [silence]

sw4809A-ms98-a-0027 105.192875 108.762250 our situation is very much very similar um
sw4809A-ms98-a-0028 108.762250 113.658625 Mary [vocalized-noise] we're both professionals and [vocalized-noise] used to working
sw4809A-ms98-a-0029 113.658625 120.393875 and we decided that when we had kids that we would uh have somebody home until they were uh well into school
sw4809A-ms98-a-0030 120.393875 123.942875 it's difficult espec[ially]- it's not so much
sw4809A-ms98-a-0031 123.942875 128.093625 difficult financially i don't think as it is uh culturally
sw4809A-ms98-a-0032 128.093625 130.477250 in that it's um
sw4809A-ms98-a-0033 130.477250 137.481000 uh kind of expected i thi[nk]- i think it's difficult on my wife not to be um
sw4809A-ms98-a-0034 137.481000 140.491000 professionally identified and that sort of thing
sw4809A-ms98-a-0035 140.491000 148.693500 but i really feel like it's been worth it for the kids and when i look around i think uh i'm i'm pretty glad we made the decision we did

sw4809A-ms98-a-0037 171.811375 174.081750 and then all of the sudden the kids come [laughter-along]

sw4809A-ms98-a-0041 198.975000 202.067875 yeah i- i think uh
sw4809A-ms98-a-0042 202.067875 203.666375 you have to be
sw4809A-ms98-a-0043 203.666375 212.605250 um i don't want to make it uh melodramatic but you have to be kind of cultural really if you want to put your family first and uh
sw4809A-ms98-a-0044 212.605250 218.867625 um to sort of uh put a cap on things that you can really have and enjoy and just go ahead and uh
sw4809A-ms98-a-0045 218.867625 222.304500 um do what's right by your by your family
sw4809A-ms98-a-0046 222.304500 225.755875 [noise] and i don't i- i don't see a lot of support out there i see
sw4809A-ms98-a-0047 225.755875 227.693125 a lot of people um
sw4809A-ms98-a-0048 227.693125 231.514500 voting down school taxes and um
sw4809A-ms98-a-0049 231.514500 238.416875 uh well a degree of the eighties was i think uh maybe the most disappointing social phenomena that i witnessed
sw4809A-ms98-a-0050 238.416875 244.317500 because_1 i really did see i[t]- living in Dallas you [laughter-see] [laughter-it] you see it in um magnified about twenty times
