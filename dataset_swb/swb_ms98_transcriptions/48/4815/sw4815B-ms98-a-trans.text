sw4815B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.062500 [noise]
sw4815B-ms98-a-0002 1.062500 11.544000 [silence]
sw4815B-ms98-a-0003 11.544000 23.541625 i do have actually as a matter of fact uh and i'm i'm not sure how it would relate to the big city but there are certainly ways and humane and and nice ways of handling care for our elderly
sw4815B-ms98-a-0004 23.541625 33.335000 i come from a very small community in northern Iowa and the churches have banded together and built and staffed a retirement home
sw4815B-ms98-a-0005 33.335000 38.446000 [noise] and the care of course is is wonderful because these are all people who care
sw4815B-ms98-a-0006 38.446000 47.937250 and every week the churches a different uh groups of the churches volunteer and come in and maybe have bingo day or special celebration day or help someone with their birthday or whatever
sw4815B-ms98-a-0007 47.937250 58.919000 and it makes the care very personalized of course but since it is a small community everybody knows everybody and so there there would be n[o]- absolutely zero chance of any abuse
sw4815B-ms98-a-0008 58.919000 90.428250 [silence]
sw4815B-ms98-a-0009 90.428250 100.731875 yeah it's it's a real problem um it is a real problem and i know that everybody hates the idea of going to one of these but i also think that
sw4815B-ms98-a-0010 100.731875 111.516875 it is a choice that we have all made in our lives as we have drawn back and internalized ourselves as opposed to being a part of the community
sw4815B-ms98-a-0011 111.516875 117.827375 uh it used to be that neighbors looked out for you the churches looked out for you but many of us don't belong to churches any more 
sw4815B-ms98-a-0012 117.827375 122.300625 and so therefore we don't have this broadened community of caring people
sw4815B-ms98-a-0013 122.300625 124.415500 [silence]
sw4815B-ms98-a-0014 124.415500 125.666250 no
sw4815B-ms98-a-0015 125.666250 133.426125 no absolutely not you know i presume when when the time comes for something to happen to me that i will probably go back to Iowa to be in that community
sw4815B-ms98-a-0016 133.426125 134.830500 but uh
sw4815B-ms98-a-0017 134.830500 143.245500 [silence]
sw4815B-ms98-a-0018 143.245500 151.025125 but it's the type of thing where i think we should look at some things that are working and try to use them in the cities also 
sw4815B-ms98-a-0019 151.025125 156.488625 i mean is there some reason why some of the churches here could not band together and do a similar situation
sw4815B-ms98-a-0020 156.488625 162.809000 [silence]
sw4815B-ms98-a-0021 162.809000 164.417500 yes
sw4815B-ms98-a-0022 164.417500 169.363125 and actually a great deal more money [laughter]
sw4815B-ms98-a-0023 169.363125 197.825750 [silence]
sw4815B-ms98-a-0024 197.825750 211.041375 right but you know if my f[amily]- if all of my kids still live here and i go back to Iowa course there is no convenience so probably it would behoove me [laughter] to try to start something of this sort here in Dallas 
sw4815B-ms98-a-0025 211.041375 213.390875 [noise] but uh
sw4815B-ms98-a-0026 213.390875 216.248125 that's a big job you know uh
sw4815B-ms98-a-0027 216.248125 224.243375 so many needs are crying the homeless the abused children the the beaten wives you know there's so many things going on that that how do we all of this
sw4815B-ms98-a-0028 224.243375 228.251375 and maybe that's a part of it maybe maybe what we can do is uh
sw4815B-ms98-a-0029 228.251375 237.199875 [noise] of course this is kind of a far flung situation but uh you know they're talking about work fare now in uh Wisconsin i believe it is
sw4815B-ms98-a-0030 237.199875 242.982375 but is there some reason i wonder why we couldn't have some of these people involved in nursing homes
sw4815B-ms98-a-0031 242.982375 244.502000 [silence]
sw4815B-ms98-a-0032 244.502000 255.827875 so that they didn't have to be so expensive you know if y[ou]- if you've got somebody who is drawing welfare then perhaps that can be quote part of their their payment for their welfare payments
sw4815B-ms98-a-0033 255.827875 265.573500 [silence]
sw4815B-ms98-a-0034 265.573500 271.406625 yeah because part of the problem now is that [noise] it costs so much money to get into a convalescent home
sw4815B-ms98-a-0035 271.406625 273.419375 or or an aged home
sw4815B-ms98-a-0036 273.419375 281.852000 you know it's almost prohibited for many persons and uh you know so what do you do does someone go on welfare in order to get in one of those homes
sw4815B-ms98-a-0037 281.852000 293.886750 or does somebody in the family quit their job so that they can be at home a[nd]- and but of course that's not always wonderful either because somebody with Alzheimers needs twenty four hour watching and nobody can do that
sw4815B-ms98-a-0038 293.886750 295.660500 nobody can do that
sw4815B-ms98-a-0039 295.660500 299.458000 [silence]
