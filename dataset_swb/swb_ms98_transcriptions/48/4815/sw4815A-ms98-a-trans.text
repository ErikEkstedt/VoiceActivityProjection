sw4815A-ms98-a-0013 62.498625 71.799375 you know i think that is probably a persons greatest fear and i'm not faced with this yet but my mother is seventy three she's in good health and living by herself but um
sw4815A-ms98-a-0014 71.799375 80.539875 i'll probably be faced with this you know sometime in the next few years as to what to do when mom gets to the point that she can't take care of herself
sw4815A-ms98-a-0015 80.539875 81.988500 um
sw4815A-ms98-a-0016 81.988500 90.931625 unfortunately having her come live with us you know if she needs constant care is not going to be an option and what do you do you know

sw4815A-ms98-a-0024 133.441750 144.202875 [noise] well it's good that you know that you have that option available um th[at]- because i don't think that too many communities have something like that set up

sw4815A-ms98-a-0028 156.160250 158.051250 probably not
sw4815A-ms98-a-0029 158.051250 165.556000 um and it might even be easier here in that there are so many more churches available more people to draw from
sw4815A-ms98-a-0030 165.556000 178.897000 well yes that's for certain my my mom lives in a small town also and i know you know the funds just aren't available uh to do something in a small town that you have that you can do in a larger town

sw4815A-ms98-a-0032 179.931125 192.957750 but um uh you know other than care conditions you know i don't know really what else a person looks for uh convenience for the family would be a a wonderful thing
sw4815A-ms98-a-0033 192.957750 195.783500 uh but th[at's]-
sw4815A-ms98-a-0034 195.783500 198.890750 that's you know that's not always an option either
