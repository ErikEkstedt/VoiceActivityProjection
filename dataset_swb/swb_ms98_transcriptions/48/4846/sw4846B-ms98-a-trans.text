sw4846B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.499000 [noise]
sw4846B-ms98-a-0002 0.499000 2.957875 [silence]
sw4846B-ms98-a-0003 2.957875 4.245875 well
sw4846B-ms98-a-0004 4.245875 14.955125 most of my reading tends to be professional reading so [vocalized-noise] uh scanning headlines in the paper or reading over my wife's shoulder tends to be about the only newspaper stuff i do
sw4846B-ms98-a-0005 14.955125 26.664500 uh and the newspaper is pretty much for local news anyway uh when it comes to national or statewide things uh i keep uh the National Public Radio station uh
sw4846B-ms98-a-0006 26.664500 29.908375 that's available here uh on all day
sw4846B-ms98-a-0007 29.908375 42.151500 and uh that's pretty much where i get my uh both uh statewide and and national news coverage together with uh a little bit of TV news in the uh in the evenings
sw4846B-ms98-a-0008 42.151500 48.906875 but primarily from from radio uh which is you know that's a dosage of about uh
sw4846B-ms98-a-0009 48.906875 52.453875 about two two and a half hours of news a day
sw4846B-ms98-a-0010 52.453875 54.011375 [silence]
sw4846B-ms98-a-0011 54.011375 65.371000 w[ell]- well i it's on in my office and i can i can hear it as i'm working when i'm here [vocalized-noise] my commute is is about fifteen minutes uh so uh uh 
sw4846B-ms98-a-0012 65.371000 70.473000 you know that's not an issue but that's primarily you know where i end up getting it from
sw4846B-ms98-a-0013 70.473000 82.746000 and and that f[or]- for me is as much a a a choice because i find it to be a good way to do it as it is a response to limited time for doing reading and stuff
sw4846B-ms98-a-0014 82.746000 89.367875 it's probably more because i just enjoy the coverage than it is because i don't have time to read the paper you know
sw4846B-ms98-a-0015 89.367875 95.335000 [silence]
sw4846B-ms98-a-0016 95.335000 104.910125 well they do to some extent i- i hear some some repeats between uh uh The Morning Edition and the All Things Considered in the afternoon uh
sw4846B-ms98-a-0017 104.910125 113.348625 i we do also have a re[peated]- an intentionally repeated coverage they start at five thirty in the morning and uh uh
sw4846B-ms98-a-0018 113.348625 126.772000 they play the first you know hour again over at the tail end of the broadcast so that people who weren't up that early still get to hear it so some of it is intentionally repeated and and so once in a while i'll hear the same story twice
sw4846B-ms98-a-0019 126.772000 138.065875 or in the afternoon i'll hear the same report from the same correspondent in Yugoslavia uh that they played in the morning so there is to some extent some repetition uh like that
sw4846B-ms98-a-0020 138.065875 149.634125 uh but uh for me it's better than trying to read uh Time or Newsweek or or US News each week i tried that once and
sw4846B-ms98-a-0021 149.634125 153.107750 uh w[hen]- if i have something to read i feel obligated to read it
sw4846B-ms98-a-0022 153.107750 157.753125 and uh then i felt guilty because i never had time to read everything that was in them
sw4846B-ms98-a-0023 157.753125 160.531250 [silence]
sw4846B-ms98-a-0024 160.531250 170.980125 yeah that was that was about it you know uh so now i'm saving trees and and uh by by not pub[lishing]- subscribing to the magazines anymore but uh uh
sw4846B-ms98-a-0025 170.980125 173.032000 well how do you do it
sw4846B-ms98-a-0026 173.032000 207.784750 [silence]
sw4846B-ms98-a-0027 207.784750 217.450375 uh see [vocalized-noise] here we're in in mountain standard time and uh we[ll]- the few times when i've run into shows like Good Morning America uh
sw4846B-ms98-a-0028 217.450375 228.340250 they've really been at the wrong time for me they seem to start very late for us and i got to be at work you know i'm leaving the house at like seven fifteen and so uh uh
sw4846B-ms98-a-0029 228.340250 240.879750 the some of them_1 [vocalized-noise] seem to be you know like they don't come on until seven or something and and so there's not enough time an[d]- uh to to watch it but they have so many other things that are thrown in
sw4846B-ms98-a-0030 240.879750 251.211500 that you know i really don't care about you know how to make baked potatoes or or whatever uh or or or weather men with funny ha[ts]- uh wigs you know
sw4846B-ms98-a-0031 251.211500 256.881375 you well yeah but the[y]- they all the morning ones have a tendency to do a little bit of that
sw4846B-ms98-a-0032 256.881375 258.176000 and
sw4846B-ms98-a-0033 258.176000 269.357000 uh you know it's mostly just the timing they seem to be on so late in the morning that i- i started wondering to myself you know so who is it that watches these things but i think it's because of our particular time zone
sw4846B-ms98-a-0034 269.357000 279.126875 uh it we don't go on daylight savings time and so everything gets shifted by an hour that may have been when i you know i looked in on it uh one time [vocalized-noise] it's just 
sw4846B-ms98-a-0035 279.126875 288.510875 uh you know for me a lot of what i look for in news is as much analysis kinds of things or uh
sw4846B-ms98-a-0036 288.510875 298.722000 sometimes human interest kinds of things that are a reflection of the news rather than just here's the events that happened uh i'm a real history nut and so
