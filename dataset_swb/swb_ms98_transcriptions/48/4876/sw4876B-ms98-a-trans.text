sw4876B-ms98-a-0005 26.079125 27.368375 uh-huh
sw4876B-ms98-a-0006 27.368375 47.418250 [silence]
sw4876B-ms98-a-0007 47.418250 48.729750 uh-huh

sw4876B-ms98-a-0009 58.547625 59.821000 uh-huh
sw4876B-ms98-a-0010 59.821000 74.582625 well i am a working mother [laughter] i have three children and my children since i um since they were very young i've had va[rious]- various um different alternatives child care arrangements and
sw4876B-ms98-a-0011 74.582625 85.077750 like most working [laughter-mothers] [laughter-i] i'm really not defensive about it i personally feel um in our particular situation i'm a much better mother when i work out of the home and
sw4876B-ms98-a-0012 85.077750 95.589250 my kids i think are very very secure well raised children my comment on this is that we paid an absolute fortune [laughter] over the years for a variety of opportunities
sw4876B-ms98-a-0013 95.589250 108.712125 so i i i uh you know it is a problem and but as you pointed out i th[ink]- i think the real problem is the low pay child care facilities and that is sometimes what some women who have to work that is all they can afford
sw4876B-ms98-a-0014 108.712125 121.429500 when our children were very young we had a pay a live in paid babysitter that was wonderful and then as they got older they went to uh i preferred to call them schools and they really were all day preschools and they were wonderful 
sw4876B-ms98-a-0015 121.429500 124.903250 and i think they got exposed to a lot of neat things
sw4876B-ms98-a-0016 124.903250 129.600000 but we did we really truly did pay a fortune i mean we were paying
sw4876B-ms98-a-0017 129.600000 131.671000 at one point
sw4876B-ms98-a-0018 131.671000 137.308625 well about about c[lose]- uh close to about five hundred dollars a week for two children
sw4876B-ms98-a-0019 137.308625 138.633375 so
sw4876B-ms98-a-0020 138.633375 142.157125 [silence]
sw4876B-ms98-a-0021 142.157125 151.712000 [laughter] well i'm a phys[ician]- i'm a physician uh and as is my husband and i and i felt very uh very good about working i'm a pediatrician actually
sw4876B-ms98-a-0022 151.712000 162.110250 so uh but i think there are some wonderful child care opportunities out there for children but and we all know the kind of things that you're supposed to look for i think
sw4876B-ms98-a-0023 162.110250 163.141500 [silence]
sw4876B-ms98-a-0024 163.141500 165.196875 [laughter]
sw4876B-ms98-a-0025 165.196875 166.708375 oh
sw4876B-ms98-a-0026 166.708375 178.320125 well i think it's real important that you have a place that first of all parents have a lot of input into and that they're always welcome and that they have a lot of activities where parents come in during the day and that at any time you can drop in
sw4876B-ms98-a-0027 178.320125 186.957875 and we had a really wonderful arrangement um i'm with the university actually and they had a wonderful uh program that started at age three
sw4876B-ms98-a-0028 186.957875 194.752000 and it was about a block away from the hospital where i work and so many times at lunchtime i would go over and visit the children and eat with them and
sw4876B-ms98-a-0029 194.752000 207.698250 see what they were doing and they had wonderful they had things like gardens and lots of pets and just they had a four to one uh teacher student ratio so that that sort of and a[ll]- most of the teachers had degrees um
sw4876B-ms98-a-0030 207.698250 209.389750 [silence]
sw4876B-ms98-a-0031 209.389750 223.560750 [laughter] yeah it was incredible actually [laughter] but it was good i mean it was it w[as]- at that time there were two children and they were in special programs and each one was a little over two hundred a week and then in addition i paid a little bit extra
sw4876B-ms98-a-0032 223.560750 233.163500 but the kids were i mean they really had some great opportunities but tha[t]- what you were alluding to earlier is you know women who work for minimal wage and
sw4876B-ms98-a-0033 233.163500 241.695500 and and really have t[o]- feel they have to put their children sometimes they do put them_1 in uh fairly low paying sit[uations]- situa[tions]-
sw4876B-ms98-a-0034 241.695500 243.494875 [silence]
sw4876B-ms98-a-0035 243.494875 245.254625 uh-huh
sw4876B-ms98-a-0036 245.254625 246.987500 um-hum
sw4876B-ms98-a-0037 246.987500 249.003000 [silence]
sw4876B-ms98-a-0038 249.003000 250.726625 no even that
sw4876B-ms98-a-0039 250.726625 265.183000 that really i think i don't it's been awhile since i've looked at my youngest child is eight so it's been a little while since i've looked into actually day care centers but they are you know the good ones do cost maybe sixty dollars a week si[nce]- and so
sw4876B-ms98-a-0040 265.183000 267.465625 um-hum
sw4876B-ms98-a-0041 267.465625 269.195875 [silence]
sw4876B-ms98-a-0042 269.195875 270.577875 um-hum
sw4876B-ms98-a-0043 270.577875 273.418125 [silence]
sw4876B-ms98-a-0044 273.418125 275.497125 [laughter] something like
sw4876B-ms98-a-0045 275.497125 275.886625 [noise]
sw4876B-ms98-a-0046 275.886625 286.058375 well you know but you made the comment earlier why would someone be interested in children i mean it has been a real um th[ere]- there have been some good [laughter-entrepreneurial] type experiences and i think
sw4876B-ms98-a-0047 286.058375 299.842000 i think they have captured a certain market again bu[t]- but then there are babysitting groups as a pediatrician one of the things we've been real concerned about is the infections as you start putting lots of little kids together the infection rates that go around and
