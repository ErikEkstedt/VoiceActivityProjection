sw4886B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 6.999250 [noise] uh no i'm not in the middle of anything i've just about the last thing i did about maybe
sw4886B-ms98-a-0002 6.999250 13.232750 oh close to a year ago now i guess i'd i helped my dad add on another bedroom on to his house
sw4886B-ms98-a-0003 13.232750 26.309500 so i guess that was yeah that was that was fairly large undertaking a a it's it's a bedroom and a walk-in closet and a bathroom all on one side of the house 
sw4886B-ms98-a-0004 26.309500 36.494125 oh we did it all except for the {sheetrocking} that was the only thing we didn't you know putting the ceiling up and things like that we don't we we weren't sure how to do that [vocalized-noise]
sw4886B-ms98-a-0005 36.494125 42.743875 [silence]
sw4886B-ms98-a-0006 42.743875 48.463000 [laughter] yeah that's the exact opposite we did all put the roof up and did all the roofing and the
sw4886B-ms98-a-0007 48.463000 57.456750 put all the interior walls up we just didn't do any of the Sheetrock wall work and that's it because_1 you have you know get those joints to go together and
sw4886B-ms98-a-0008 57.456750 66.716250 and whatever you have to put in there to get the Shee[trock]- to take the gaps out between the sheets and on the ceiling and all that i didn't we didn't know a thing about any of that and so
sw4886B-ms98-a-0009 66.716250 68.272250 [laughter]
sw4886B-ms98-a-0010 68.272250 77.576500 it's it looked very hard to do so we figured well just i don't think we could do it and make it look professional so we left it left it to somebody who does it for a living but
sw4886B-ms98-a-0011 77.576500 79.576000 [silence]
sw4886B-ms98-a-0012 79.576000 86.717500 probably so and i'd we'd never done it so we just left it alone but that's i guess so i'm only twenty one so
sw4886B-ms98-a-0013 86.717500 97.050500 i my my vast experience of of home home owner's knowledge is not very much so it's just what i have to do more or less around the house you know for my parents so
sw4886B-ms98-a-0014 97.050500 101.946875 [silence]
sw4886B-ms98-a-0015 101.946875 109.233125 it was brand new we started with th[e]- the backyard and turned it into part of the house so it was
sw4886B-ms98-a-0016 109.233125 112.839625 um well my dad knew how to do most of it you know he
sw4886B-ms98-a-0017 112.839625 127.173250 he had we'd gotten a couple of books and then he just started doing it i don't know he well he did all the flooring himself he put the whole the whole floor in and then i just started with the walls and the roof and started there and then we were put us like a
sw4886B-ms98-a-0018 127.173250 139.068250 not not necessarily a garage but just like a off the side of that after we had the house part made we just decided we'd carry the roof out a little bit farther and put a carport more or less it's not you know it's not enclosed it's just
sw4886B-ms98-a-0019 139.068250 143.783500 somewhere to drive another car to to park and it's
sw4886B-ms98-a-0020 143.783500 146.565125 uh it's off the ground

sw4886B-ms98-a-0043 251.119375 252.476875 [silence]
sw4886B-ms98-a-0044 252.476875 254.760750 it's probably more there
