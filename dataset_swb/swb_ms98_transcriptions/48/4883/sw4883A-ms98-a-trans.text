sw4883A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 9.288250 [noise] i know uh product quality first of all i have had to return products uh generally those products that i bought mail order recently
sw4883A-ms98-a-0002 9.288250 18.291125 well i think that you know brand name products that we've become familiar with have in most cases you know gotten better
sw4883A-ms98-a-0003 18.291125 25.473750 i think that we have a problem in this country with consumer protection laws and the lack thereof
sw4883A-ms98-a-0004 25.473750 32.455250 f[or]- for a lot of things there's some real junky mail order places out there um that we've ordered from
sw4883A-ms98-a-0005 32.455250 43.998625 in the past and ended up with not what we expected and having an absolute nightmare especially in dealing with a mail order in trying to return a product and get satisfaction
sw4883A-ms98-a-0006 43.998625 55.204250 i it it seems like every time i turn around i have to write one of my world famous complaint letters to try and resolve these situations with these kinds of mail order places
sw4883A-ms98-a-0007 55.204250 63.494750 uh but you know generally speaking i think products in most cases have gotten better than they were in the in the past
sw4883A-ms98-a-0008 63.494750 80.461375 [silence]
sw4883A-ms98-a-0009 80.461375 82.488750 yeah
sw4883A-ms98-a-0010 82.488750 86.708125 [silence]
sw4883A-ms98-a-0011 86.708125 94.998500 oh yeah i'm not happy at all with Silo i [vocalized-noise] we have every time you look around and there there's a price that's better somewhere else
sw4883A-ms98-a-0012 94.998500 109.225875 i there's a lot of rip-offs out there uh even in [vocalized-noise] parts of the retail uh community as far as uh you know they there seems to be this real lack of ability in dealing well with customer service 
sw4883A-ms98-a-0013 109.225875 119.768125 with and product support for a lot of these products i remembered when i you know certain product names where you'd get the product and immediately there's a problem with it and it needs to be upgraded and
sw4883A-ms98-a-0014 119.768125 126.236500 suddenly it's your responsibility to pay all of this money to have it done when it was their fault to begin with
sw4883A-ms98-a-0015 126.236500 140.972125 that that really irks me and i you know i'm not use to that and with technology you know i've had some answering machines here die very quickly yet other brand names you know Panasonic and that that little that i can drop on the floor and they still work
sw4883A-ms98-a-0016 140.972125 148.453000 it you you really these days because we don't everything's been deregulated we don't seem to care as much about consumer protection
sw4883A-ms98-a-0017 148.453000 156.438875 if you aren't {ultrawise} uh in shopping and looking for products you're in real trouble
sw4883A-ms98-a-0018 156.438875 169.652125 [vocalized-noise] i mean you have to have your consumer reports you got to have um you know David Horowitz and and all these things it's just to buy something i mean the the amount of money you have to spend on some of this high technology 
sw4883A-ms98-a-0019 169.652125 177.834500 today and then you have these brand names that attempt to mimic the the these brand names that we know
sw4883A-ms98-a-0020 177.834500 182.993000 and then you're you're if you're not informed as a consumer you end up with absolute junk
