sw4861B-ms98-a-0002 2.229875 17.672375 [silence]
sw4861B-ms98-a-0003 17.672375 18.947500 um-hum
sw4861B-ms98-a-0004 18.947500 20.791750 [silence]
sw4861B-ms98-a-0005 20.791750 22.010500 right
sw4861B-ms98-a-0006 22.010500 27.657625 [silence]
sw4861B-ms98-a-0007 27.657625 28.950250 sure
sw4861B-ms98-a-0008 28.950250 29.966500 [silence]
sw4861B-ms98-a-0009 29.966500 33.617250 right i think i- i agree with that to a certain degree
sw4861B-ms98-a-0010 33.617250 40.518625 um certainly on an absolute scale it should be i- i think it should be funded more
sw4861B-ms98-a-0011 40.518625 47.209250 on a relative scale um looking at it in comparison with other
sw4861B-ms98-a-0012 47.209250 50.909500 problems and no it's not a big environment
sw4861B-ms98-a-0013 50.909500 53.436375 i'm not so sure about that however
sw4861B-ms98-a-0014 53.436375 67.663750 um yeah you're right definitely there's there's a definite um stigma out there that yeah it's it's it's limited exclusive to intravenous drugs users and homosexuals and um blacks or whatever
sw4861B-ms98-a-0015 67.663750 74.541125 and that's not that's not the case anymore it may have started out that way even though there's there's still no proof of that
sw4861B-ms98-a-0016 74.541125 76.573625 actually the most recent
sw4861B-ms98-a-0017 76.573625 81.983875 um the that i've gotten is they're starting to look at um
sw4861B-ms98-a-0018 81.983875 85.704250 well it started over in Africa they're starting to look at
sw4861B-ms98-a-0019 85.704250 87.344625 i believe
sw4861B-ms98-a-0020 87.344625 88.384625 [silence]
sw4861B-ms98-a-0021 88.384625 90.861500 but believe it of monkey
sw4861B-ms98-a-0022 90.861500 92.214875 [vocalized-noise]
sw4861B-ms98-a-0023 92.214875 95.214250 yeah there was some kind of research going on
sw4861B-ms98-a-0024 95.214250 105.114250 and i can't remember what the exact uh gist of it was but something they hadn't considered before and it's like they now they're trying to go way back to the original
sw4861B-ms98-a-0025 105.114250 110.265250 first outbreaks of it to see if they can uh nail down what [vocalized-noise] exactly it was
sw4861B-ms98-a-0026 110.265250 111.736375 but uh
sw4861B-ms98-a-0027 111.736375 116.742750 [silence]
sw4861B-ms98-a-0028 116.742750 117.983250 um-hum
sw4861B-ms98-a-0029 117.983250 122.198125 [silence]
sw4861B-ms98-a-0030 122.198125 123.733500 oh sure
sw4861B-ms98-a-0031 123.733500 125.127625 yeah
sw4861B-ms98-a-0032 125.127625 150.384000 [silence]
sw4861B-ms98-a-0033 150.384000 153.056500 yeah um-hum well i- i agree with that
sw4861B-ms98-a-0034 153.056500 161.612750 um the point i- i wanted to make was just strictly the environment like right now they say we've lost forty percent of the ozone layer just last year
sw4861B-ms98-a-0035 161.612750 170.090375 in in se[lected]- in selected spots and that's really becoming a really big problem but that's not to down play the importance of AIDS research you know
sw4861B-ms98-a-0036 170.090375 174.607125 um when you think about that importance you also have to consider that uh
sw4861B-ms98-a-0037 174.607125 181.344875 not only is AIDS good in and of it's own but it also uh has a lot to deal with
sw4861B-ms98-a-0038 181.344875 192.812500 um cancer and with mononucleosis and all the all the various diseases that affect the T cell from a and the and the when the white cells of the immune system because all fairly interrelated
sw4861B-ms98-a-0039 192.812500 196.558250 so i think research on AIDS would benefit all that stuff
sw4861B-ms98-a-0040 196.558250 197.836500 yeah
sw4861B-ms98-a-0041 197.836500 201.249750 [silence]
sw4861B-ms98-a-0042 201.249750 203.977750 oh yeah [laughter]
sw4861B-ms98-a-0043 203.977750 205.144625 [silence]
sw4861B-ms98-a-0044 205.144625 206.365875 um-hum
sw4861B-ms98-a-0045 206.365875 207.693125 [silence]
sw4861B-ms98-a-0046 207.693125 211.401750 but it seems a lot like they're almost covering it up at this point [vocalized-noise]
sw4861B-ms98-a-0047 211.401750 215.739875 you you you really don't see a lot out there
sw4861B-ms98-a-0048 215.739875 218.053625 yeah [laughter]
sw4861B-ms98-a-0049 218.053625 222.722625 [silence]
sw4861B-ms98-a-0050 222.722625 228.638375 right you know that's that's for sure i- i like i said i go to school at UCF in Florida
sw4861B-ms98-a-0051 228.638375 235.200750 and actually that kind of hits home because that Kimberly Begajah that had AIDS
sw4861B-ms98-a-0052 235.200750 240.915375 uh and died from it she went to a dentist in Stewart Florida that's where she got it
sw4861B-ms98-a-0053 240.915375 244.916125 and Stewart's like three hours away from where i go to school
sw4861B-ms98-a-0054 244.916125 246.864500 [silence]
sw4861B-ms98-a-0055 246.864500 250.733000 uh more than that i had a couple of friends who went to that dentist
sw4861B-ms98-a-0056 250.733000 259.637750 yeah and they were definitely sweating bullets there for a while um and found out that they they were negative you know they didn't have any problems but um
sw4861B-ms98-a-0057 259.637750 263.503500 you know boy talk about making you think twice before you go to the dentist
sw4861B-ms98-a-0058 263.503500 266.676500 or any health care practitioner at this point
sw4861B-ms98-a-0059 266.676500 273.725500 yeah because_1 they really the last article i read on that they still hadn't figured out how she could've gotten it from him
sw4861B-ms98-a-0060 273.725500 281.701000 because he he as far as they could tell he sterilized the equipment he used gloves he did all the the proper precautions
sw4861B-ms98-a-0061 281.701000 285.389750 um asides from telling his patients that he had AIDS
sw4861B-ms98-a-0062 285.389750 292.598375 um but still that didn't make any difference they still got it so they they're not real sure how that how that worked
sw4861B-ms98-a-0063 292.598375 294.200500 but uh
sw4861B-ms98-a-0064 294.200500 298.082000 yeah i'm i'm a lot more cautious of that but
