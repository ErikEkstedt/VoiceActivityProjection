sw2615B-ms98-a-0004 32.127125 46.465500 oh most of the cars i buy i try to buy as simple a car as possible so you know changing the oil changing the spark plugs and most of them now you know you don't go through the ignition stuff anymore because that's all solid state or
sw2615B-ms98-a-0005 46.465500 53.885625 or fuel injected so there goes the carburetor and if the fuel injection system breaks down there's no way in the world you're going to work on that

sw2615B-ms98-a-0018 100.494250 108.134750 i had to change the water pump in that here about a year ago and it was really fairly easy take the grill out and the radiator out and you can just stand there and work on it

sw2615B-ms98-a-0020 112.922125 121.976375 well that's true [laughter] that you're right you know by the time you've finally got down to it i was hoping i could remember where all those other things went
sw2615B-ms98-a-0021 121.976375 128.555500 [silence]
sw2615B-ms98-a-0022 128.555500 142.881250 a few years ago i had an Oldsmobile diesel and uh the uh it after about a hundred thousand miles the injector pump went out on it and uh i bought it when we were living in Lubbock when i came back here i brought the car back here and uh
sw2615B-ms98-a-0023 142.881250 153.781125 i don't know diesels got pretty unpopular and you couldn't sell the thing i mean though for what you could get for one you might as well drive it over a cliff and uh the injector pump went bad so i
sw2615B-ms98-a-0024 153.781125 163.084500 found an outfit down here to rebuild it and uh i- reinstalled that and that was probably one of the most miserable things i had gotten into in a long time
sw2615B-ms98-a-0025 163.084500 164.387375 [silence]
sw2615B-ms98-a-0026 164.387375 170.157125 uh well if you know [vocalized-noise] diesels don't require mechanics they require plumbers

sw2615B-ms98-a-0032 193.453750 202.555375 thumb and the yeah you can get to them and the ones in in the diesel cars were little tiny things and just almost impossible to do anything with
sw2615B-ms98-a-0033 202.555375 214.020125 i've had a lot of good service out of that car but uh uh i finally gave it to my son and he drove it literally into the ground [laughter-you] [laughter-know] [laughter] he was out at Tech and he he finished it off

sw2615B-ms98-a-0040 244.812125 253.627500 needed and it was the van that i needed then to buying the you know traded it in on the Chevy van but uh i sure enjoyed it
