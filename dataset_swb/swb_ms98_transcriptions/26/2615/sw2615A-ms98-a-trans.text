sw2615A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.536375 [silence]
sw2615A-ms98-a-0002 0.536375 9.824875 i don't know what the the last thing i've done far as car repairs go is is change oil and filter an and that kind of stuff i haven't gotten really involved in anything
sw2615A-ms98-a-0003 9.824875 18.428250 uh extensive in car repairs in oh oh probably a year or so i think the last thing i did of any significance was change the water pump on an Oldsmobile
sw2615A-ms98-a-0004 18.428250 36.269500 [silence]
sw2615A-ms98-a-0005 36.269500 37.699375 yeah i know what you mean
sw2615A-ms98-a-0006 37.699375 44.724750 [silence]
sw2615A-ms98-a-0007 44.724750 45.890000 yeah
sw2615A-ms98-a-0008 45.890000 48.307375 they're fuel injected and so there's
sw2615A-ms98-a-0009 48.307375 52.804625 yeah
sw2615A-ms98-a-0010 52.804625 66.683750 no there's no way somebody once said uh i had a car that said fuel injection on the side of it and a woman asked me what that meant and i said that means that i can't work on it you know they've gotten so complicated or so high tech that uh
sw2615A-ms98-a-0011 66.683750 73.918875 the guys average guys can't really go out in the in the garage and do a whole lot of repairs uh
sw2615A-ms98-a-0012 73.918875 78.473375 [silence]
sw2615A-ms98-a-0013 78.473375 79.662875 yeah
sw2615A-ms98-a-0014 79.662875 81.151375 [silence]
sw2615A-ms98-a-0015 81.151375 82.721625 absolutely
sw2615A-ms98-a-0016 82.721625 88.181625 [silence]
sw2615A-ms98-a-0017 88.181625 90.218625 yeah i used to have uh
sw2615A-ms98-a-0018 90.218625 94.157125 Chevy van it was a short van that had the the three fifty in it
sw2615A-ms98-a-0019 94.157125 100.667375 and basically it it was a motor and you didn't have all the other junk around it and you could get to it to work on it
sw2615A-ms98-a-0020 100.667375 107.647750 [silence]
sw2615A-ms98-a-0021 107.647750 113.762500 yeah the hardest part about uh water pump changes is getting all the junk off before you can get too it
sw2615A-ms98-a-0022 113.762500 121.073500 [silence]
sw2615A-ms98-a-0023 121.073500 128.795625 well that's kind of the way i was i tried to remember as i took stuff off where it went and i don't think i had too many nuts and bolts left over when i got it all put back together
sw2615A-ms98-a-0024 128.795625 146.675875 [silence]
sw2615A-ms98-a-0025 146.675875 148.433125 oh yeah
sw2615A-ms98-a-0026 148.433125 155.923250 [silence]
sw2615A-ms98-a-0027 155.923250 156.801250 yeah
sw2615A-ms98-a-0028 156.801250 162.610000 [silence]
sw2615A-ms98-a-0029 162.610000 165.027250 i don't think i'd know where to start with a diesel
sw2615A-ms98-a-0030 165.027250 168.874500 [silence]
sw2615A-ms98-a-0031 168.874500 170.481250 well that's true
sw2615A-ms98-a-0032 170.481250 172.257000 [silence]
sw2615A-ms98-a-0033 172.257000 182.954125 i think the onl[y]- closest thing i've come to to a diesel is i've worked for a tractor repair shop uh when i was in high school and uh we used to overhaul farm tractors basically
sw2615A-ms98-a-0034 182.954125 188.569125 and they were nearly all all diesel but as far as cars i've never never been involved with them
sw2615A-ms98-a-0035 188.569125 193.491125 [silence]
sw2615A-ms98-a-0036 193.491125 196.689000 well ye[ah]- yeah and you ca[n]- you can get to them
sw2615A-ms98-a-0037 196.689000 202.453625 [silence]
sw2615A-ms98-a-0038 202.453625 204.079500 well i
sw2615A-ms98-a-0039 204.079500 209.821125 [silence]
sw2615A-ms98-a-0040 209.821125 210.985625 yeah
sw2615A-ms98-a-0041 210.985625 212.534250 i'm
sw2615A-ms98-a-0042 212.534250 225.145125 i guess you're right the the diesel has almost fallen into unpopular status i don't know exactly why One of the reasons is i i'm beginning to wonder is where do you get gas at i su[re]- i don't know if it's still
sw2615A-ms98-a-0043 225.145125 230.610375 uh limited like it was i don't notice it probably because i don't huh
sw2615A-ms98-a-0044 230.610375 234.399500 yeah i don't i don't notice but maybe because i'm not looking for it yeah
sw2615A-ms98-a-0045 234.399500 244.135625 [silence]
sw2615A-ms98-a-0046 244.135625 245.236875 yeah
sw2615A-ms98-a-0047 245.236875 250.579750 [silence]
sw2615A-ms98-a-0048 250.579750 253.902750 but you you got the you got the three fifty in the van
sw2615A-ms98-a-0049 253.902750 256.043500 [silence]
sw2615A-ms98-a-0050 256.043500 259.910625 yeah that's what i like because they've got plenty of power and uh
sw2615A-ms98-a-0051 259.910625 274.907125 if you treat them right they're not the gas guzzlers i think that they've got the reputation to be i'm convinced that uh Detroit or whoever it is made a major mistake years ago when they stopped putting the small V eights in and went to the fours and some of the sixes
sw2615A-ms98-a-0052 274.907125 282.126250 i'm convinced that the small V eight like the the Mustang's original two eighty nine or some of the Chevy two eighty threes
sw2615A-ms98-a-0053 282.126250 290.305250 were good little V eight engines that were not gas guzzlers but they had enough power to pull all this weight And the four cylinders just don't have it
sw2615A-ms98-a-0054 290.305250 295.176625 [silence]
sw2615A-ms98-a-0055 295.176625 296.380000 yeah
sw2615A-ms98-a-0056 296.380000 317.257500 [silence]
sw2615A-ms98-a-0057 317.257500 322.774625 i think those g[uys]- those little V eights could have been made to be pretty powerful little engines if they would have gone with it but
sw2615A-ms98-a-0058 322.774625 325.523125 [silence]
sw2615A-ms98-a-0059 325.523125 326.751250 oh yeah
sw2615A-ms98-a-0060 326.751250 338.159500 [silence]
sw2615A-ms98-a-0061 338.159500 339.613500 yeah
sw2615A-ms98-a-0062 339.613500 342.064750 yeah that's kind of like
sw2615A-ms98-a-0063 342.064750 356.704250 the the first well my first car was a fifty six Mustang and uh over the years uh all i had a uh Dodge pickup several years ago and uh i can't remember the size of the engine it was a three O seven or something like that
sw2615A-ms98-a-0064 356.704250 370.472875 but uh i remember working on those cars you'd open the hood and there was basically nothing in there but an engine and a few things Now you open the hood and it's scary like you say it takes a plumber to figure out where all this stuff goes
sw2615A-ms98-a-0065 370.472875 380.835875 yeah 
sw2615A-ms98-a-0066 380.835875 382.283375 yeah
sw2615A-ms98-a-0067 382.283375 385.204750 well if you had to you could climb up in there and do what you needed to
sw2615A-ms98-a-0068 385.204750 386.274875 [silence]
sw2615A-ms98-a-0069 386.274875 396.851000 my dad's got a new um i guess it's an eighty nine or ninety uh Chrysler something or other it's one those transverse mounted V sixes front wheel drive
sw2615A-ms98-a-0070 396.851000 404.898125 and uh he was showing it to me and we're looking under the hood and everything's nice and clean and you know you can see the three spark plugs there in the front And i said well where are the other three [laughter]
sw2615A-ms98-a-0071 404.898125 413.001625 and he had never really thought about it And he says well hopefully i won't have to change them before i trade it off Yeah it's going to be a problem getting back there because it was shoved right up against the fire wall
sw2615A-ms98-a-0072 413.001625 417.723500 so they just about complicated the things so much that shade tree mechanics can't do much with them
sw2615A-ms98-a-0073 417.723500 444.519250 [silence]
sw2615A-ms98-a-0074 444.519250 445.682125 right
sw2615A-ms98-a-0075 445.682125 447.533750 [silence]
sw2615A-ms98-a-0076 447.533750 449.665750 yeah the {antismog} pumps
sw2615A-ms98-a-0077 449.665750 454.008500 [silence]
sw2615A-ms98-a-0078 454.008500 457.756000 [noise] and all that stuff loads the motor down
sw2615A-ms98-a-0079 457.756000 460.031250 so it's trying to push the weight plus
sw2615A-ms98-a-0080 460.031250 462.764125 have all this drain on it from all sorts of
sw2615A-ms98-a-0081 462.764125 464.127125 belts and things
sw2615A-ms98-a-0082 464.127125 468.335375 but that's one good thing i've got a uh eight ninety uh
sw2615A-ms98-a-0083 468.335375 473.282125 Chevy Blazer now and it's got one uh belt on it a serpentine belt
sw2615A-ms98-a-0084 473.282125 475.705375 [silence]
sw2615A-ms98-a-0085 475.705375 477.269000 yeah
sw2615A-ms98-a-0086 477.269000 490.470125 i haven't had to replace the thing yet it looks like it would be uh better than having i've got an an Olds Tornado that i think's got six belts on the sucker And i had to get all those off you know when i was replace that uh water pump and uh
sw2615A-ms98-a-0087 490.470125 494.031750 i had to struggle with that for a while to figure which belt goes where
sw2615A-ms98-a-0088 494.031750 496.811500 [silence]
sw2615A-ms98-a-0089 496.811500 498.635750 oh man
sw2615A-ms98-a-0090 498.635750 502.342250 [silence]
sw2615A-ms98-a-0091 502.342250 508.275000 you bet everything else's got to come off first well it's a pleasure meeting you
sw2615A-ms98-a-0092 508.275000 511.424875 [silence]
sw2615A-ms98-a-0093 511.424875 519.684125 uh i've got uh five stickers here from TI so i guess i've done probably uh i'd say seven or eight of them
sw2615A-ms98-a-0094 519.684125 524.122625 [silence]
sw2615A-ms98-a-0095 524.122625 538.308500 yeah i haven't gotten any calls in two weeks so i don't know if if it's tapering off or or what is i had a difficult time the past couple of times of getting uh answers so it sounds it's taken them ten fifteen minutes at a time so
sw2615A-ms98-a-0096 538.308500 545.000000 people or either not or maybe they're burned out or they're through with it anyway let you go thanks for talking bye
sw2615A-ms98-a-0097 545.000000 546.777750 [noise]
