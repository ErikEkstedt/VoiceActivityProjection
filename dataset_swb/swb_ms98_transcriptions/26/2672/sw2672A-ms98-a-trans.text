sw2672A-ms98-a-0018 77.321875 88.771375 well that's good well Rowlett had sent sent out a survey not too long ago um in terms in how many people were interested in having a a pick up
sw2672A-ms98-a-0019 88.771375 101.163375 i guess on the days they do trash or something like that And apparently a lot of people responded to it favor[ably]- favorably because they're going to do it i don't know how how soon they're going to do it or
sw2672A-ms98-a-0020 101.163375 109.225125 how organized it's going to be but they're they're supposed to initiate that some sometime in the next couple of months
sw2672A-ms98-a-0021 109.225125 116.534625 [silence]
sw2672A-ms98-a-0022 116.534625 130.687000 um i've never noticed that we don't have a a whole lot because we're in a hospital setting so most of the things we have are through our cafeteria um
sw2672A-ms98-a-0023 130.687000 135.105000 [silence]
sw2672A-ms98-a-0024 135.105000 147.527625 um no there's there's only one pop machine and it's not accessible to the cafeteria now so uh mainly what they serve in there is juice and coffee and tea

sw2672A-ms98-a-0040 203.478875 208.508500 yeah i i guess Rowlett's done a lot for the size town it is [vocalized-noise] 
sw2672A-ms98-a-0041 208.508500 223.160250 and i think they're trying to to make some changes i i noticed at the library or someplace this past uh month month and a half ago they were having a speaker um talk about
sw2672A-ms98-a-0042 223.160250 232.114625 doing lawn work and h[ow]- how important it is to to cut your lawn without a bag 
sw2672A-ms98-a-0043 232.114625 243.541375 just kind of mulch it rather than bag it up because of a[ll]- all the the grass that's being bagged and being hauled away by the garbage trucks and stuff
sw2672A-ms98-a-0044 243.541375 250.457125 and it's uh i guess a lot more e[cological]- ecological to just mow the grass and 
sw2672A-ms98-a-0045 250.457125 251.679500 [silence]
sw2672A-ms98-a-0046 251.679500 255.046125 let it work it's way back into the soil

sw2672A-ms98-a-0048 259.643375 261.898875 i saw part of that

sw2672A-ms98-a-0059 310.826750 324.842000 yeah well there are a lot of things that aren't i'm that's uh one of the things i wonder about uh one of the questions was do you think more should be done or something else i i wonder about some of the prod[ucts]- products that they don't take like some of the plastics and things that they don't take
sw2672A-ms98-a-0060 324.842000 328.984750 uh why why they couldn't do more recycling with those
sw2672A-ms98-a-0061 328.984750 340.653500 [silence]
sw2672A-ms98-a-0062 340.653500 341.888375 hum

sw2672A-ms98-a-0066 358.428625 367.183250 true yeah i noticed that about things like i s[een]- i seen a lot of adds recently for organic fertilizers and 
sw2672A-ms98-a-0067 367.183250 382.055625 and lawn additives and that type of thing but the cost is is like double or sometimes triple what the regular things you fertilizers and things you buy so in in terms of that it's you know
sw2672A-ms98-a-0068 382.055625 387.537750 for the environment it its there is good reason to do it the cost is kind of prohibited

sw2672A-ms98-a-0082 437.880625 443.411750 i i'd heard something stranger talk about bottles the other day on uh
sw2672A-ms98-a-0083 443.411750 454.121750 on the radio station i think it's K L T Y they were talking about the i think it's in Canada they're using oh recyclable milk jugs plastic milk jugs
sw2672A-ms98-a-0084 454.121750 460.029500 as a a reinforcement for roads for road repairs
sw2672A-ms98-a-0085 460.029500 465.503125 and apparently they they don't break down very easily and
sw2672A-ms98-a-0086 465.503125 473.571250 they don't expand or or contract when the weather changes and [laughter] this is kind of an unusual use for
sw2672A-ms98-a-0087 473.571250 475.596875 that type of thing

sw2672A-ms98-a-0101 550.377500 564.964000 well i think the the more people are aware of it the the more they'll do i think that's just the biggest problem is keeping it in in front of the public so they understand how serious the problem is and how important it is to do that
