sw2672B-ms98-a-0035 262.818125 275.653250 the only thing i g[uess]- thought um that i haven't been trying is when i you know go to take a shower to save the water and to put it on my plants which i had never thought about before
sw2672B-ms98-a-0036 275.653250 288.245625 but i've already gone to oh i started years ago i guess not years ago but yeah i would say five years ago turning off my fountain i mean my water faucet in the sink when i brush my teeth
sw2672B-ms98-a-0037 288.245625 292.876000 but i didn't realize that was the biggest waste of water that was surprising to me
sw2672B-ms98-a-0038 292.876000 304.039375 i missed that question totally i mean really bad i'm trying to think i didn't miss too many i can't remember what my score was but i did exceeding well i was surprised
sw2672B-ms98-a-0039 304.039375 310.501125 but i didn't realize that our garbage isn't being decomposed that was a shocker to me
sw2672B-ms98-a-0040 310.501125 329.464750 [silence]
sw2672B-ms98-a-0041 329.464750 339.315000 well i was in uh Bizmart the other day and what i don't understand is there is recycled paper in there and it cost more 
sw2672B-ms98-a-0042 339.315000 342.025000 than regular paper
sw2672B-ms98-a-0043 342.025000 347.694375 and it was only i think uh forty cents more you know fifty cents more but
sw2672B-ms98-a-0044 347.694375 359.540375 it {upseted} me to realize that hey the recycling that they're going through the expense of recycling but people aren't buying it so the cost of it is higher
sw2672B-ms98-a-0045 359.540375 374.155750 [silence]
sw2672B-ms98-a-0046 374.155750 375.633125 uh-huh

sw2672B-ms98-a-0049 391.190250 403.048750 you know companies that do at least go into it i'd like to see subsidy by the government or something or {taxwise} or something heavily enough to where they could get their prices lower than regular
sw2672B-ms98-a-0050 403.048750 406.993500 so that people would use this stuff re[use]- over again
sw2672B-ms98-a-0051 406.993500 418.866000 it's like when he was saying uh which one was recyclable which was reusable and the recycle ones are better to use but lots of times you don't even see the signs on the bottles
sw2672B-ms98-a-0052 418.866000 419.876250 [silence]
sw2672B-ms98-a-0053 419.876250 424.572750 and if we're going to really do something they ought to put that stuff out bigger for people to see it
sw2672B-ms98-a-0054 424.572750 427.475000 i had to put my bifocals on [laughter-to] [laughter-see] [laughter-it]
sw2672B-ms98-a-0055 427.475000 439.772125 that's hard when you're in a grocery store and you're short anyway [laughter] you have to get enough nerve to ask somebody to take something off the top shelf you haven't got enough nerve to say well put it back it's not recyclable
sw2672B-ms98-a-0056 439.772125 453.269875 [silence]
sw2672B-ms98-a-0057 453.269875 454.407750 uh-huh

sw2672B-ms98-a-0063 474.813500 480.294375 well you know they're along that same line they said they were using um
sw2672B-ms98-a-0064 480.294375 491.424250 what is oh i know it was toilets you know the old ones smashing them up because they're that stuff there is great for in road work 
sw2672B-ms98-a-0065 491.424250 501.179875 and i thought well that's good and then i saw recycling on tires between uh well hoses were being used
sw2672B-ms98-a-0066 501.179875 510.178125 and uh uh soaker hoses made out of old tires what else something else was made out of old tires i was trying to remember what it was
sw2672B-ms98-a-0067 510.178125 511.485625 [silence]
sw2672B-ms98-a-0068 511.485625 513.787875 oh i can't think of it now
sw2672B-ms98-a-0069 513.787875 523.677500 but i was i was trying to get my uh kids you know to see different things that we could come up with for recycling purposes
sw2672B-ms98-a-0070 523.677500 536.161250 and just anything to you know recycle rather than keep throwing it away but my biggest problem is i take the bags out of the store buy the bags to bring the[m]- back and then i forget to bring them in the store
sw2672B-ms98-a-0071 536.161250 550.471375 i'm forever going back out to my car to pick up my bags to bring them and take my garbage back out i wish they'd really push this recycling bit because i never realized i really didn't realize how much stuff i actually throw away
sw2672B-ms98-a-0072 550.471375 564.987125 [silence]
sw2672B-ms98-a-0073 564.987125 573.226125 you know what i'd like to see a little more i don't have any little tiny kids but if they get the little tiny kids saving it now
sw2672B-ms98-a-0074 573.226125 577.746125 in five years when they get bigger it'll work a little bit more too
sw2672B-ms98-a-0075 577.746125 582.276500 because it's we've all got to do it right now i just
sw2672B-ms98-a-0076 582.276500 592.461625 i really amazed to find out that what is it eighty per cent are filled now in in garbage fills in five years we're supposed to be at max
sw2672B-ms98-a-0077 592.461625 595.593500 i don't think i can keep my own garbage
sw2672B-ms98-a-0078 595.593500 598.612500 i mean i might not have that much
sw2672B-ms98-a-0079 598.612500 599.542375 but i would
