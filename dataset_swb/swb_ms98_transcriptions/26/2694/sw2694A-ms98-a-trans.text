sw2694A-ms98-a-0025 89.137125 102.991125 i had the uh brakes changed on my car and what went in what i went in for i thought was rather a routine um not real expensive but you know maybe expensive but it turned out to be a four hundred dollar brake job
sw2694A-ms98-a-0026 102.991125 111.984250 and they they work okay but the noise is so loud there's such a whirring noise and they tell me that that should have gone away in two hundred miles but i
