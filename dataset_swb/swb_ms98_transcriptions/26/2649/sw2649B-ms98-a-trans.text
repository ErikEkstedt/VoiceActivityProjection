sw2649B-ms98-a-0008 75.737375 79.532625 well i've seen you know i've seen examples of uh communities where they
sw2649B-ms98-a-0009 79.532625 84.817375 they take the other other approach you know you you have to do it or you're fined
sw2649B-ms98-a-0010 84.817375 89.710375 and you know i'm actually all for that i don't i'm probably not the b[est]-
sw2649B-ms98-a-0011 89.710375 93.872250 best person for recycling but i'll be damned if you know if they they didn't uh
sw2649B-ms98-a-0012 93.872250 98.772750 charge me an extra ten bucks for garbage collection every month i'd be sure and recycle
sw2649B-ms98-a-0013 98.772750 101.207750 i mean it's not that much trouble
sw2649B-ms98-a-0014 101.207750 107.493125 it's just different different communities that pass the laws that say you have to have to recycle
sw2649B-ms98-a-0015 107.493125 112.432125 you have to you have to you know on Mondays they pick up glass and on Tuesdays it's
sw2649B-ms98-a-0016 112.432125 116.036750 you know plastics or whatever and if if you don't uh
sw2649B-ms98-a-0017 116.036750 120.799750 if your garbage is just out there in a bag and it's not sorted you know they mark you down and
sw2649B-ms98-a-0018 120.799750 123.547625 fine you for it sh[it]- it's kind of like
sw2649B-ms98-a-0019 123.547625 128.168000 it's the same principal when there's a drought they fine you for using water you know they just
sw2649B-ms98-a-0020 128.168000 130.630875 you don't do what they say and you
sw2649B-ms98-a-0021 130.630875 136.395500 not that i promote over government or anything but you know the the world's in a bad enough state that

sw2649B-ms98-a-0023 137.946250 139.256250 [silence]
sw2649B-ms98-a-0024 139.256250 142.408500 people being the way they are you kind of need some incentive

sw2649B-ms98-a-0037 185.697125 188.283625 and they were talking about you know a lot of the plastic bottles
sw2649B-ms98-a-0038 188.283625 191.445125 you can't just throw all plastics together
sw2649B-ms98-a-0039 191.445125 199.063125 and they were talking about you know you need legislation to uh identify what kind of plastic it this is so you know you know you know 
sw2649B-ms98-a-0040 199.063125 201.411625 what can be recycled as what
sw2649B-ms98-a-0041 201.411625 208.305625 because you know say shampoo bottles i think was the example they gave there's no they don't even give you any indication of what kind of plastic that is
sw2649B-ms98-a-0042 208.305625 210.516250 you just can't throw that in with your
sw2649B-ms98-a-0043 210.516250 212.906250 two liter Coke bottles or whatever
sw2649B-ms98-a-0044 212.906250 214.312000 [silence]

sw2649B-ms98-a-0046 218.409125 221.149875 [silence]
sw2649B-ms98-a-0047 221.149875 230.655250 yeah they yeah that or you know things need might be identified and there needs to be a means a convenient means for people to to recycle i know for me now i've got to drive
sw2649B-ms98-a-0048 230.655250 237.298625 a few miles down the road to do it if i want to do it and a lot of times it's the difference between doing it or not doing it
sw2649B-ms98-a-0049 237.298625 238.986500 you know is
sw2649B-ms98-a-0050 238.986500 242.496750 whether you can like take it out the back like stick it out in the back
sw2649B-ms98-a-0051 242.496750 247.134125 [noise] back alley for the guys to pick up when they do or
sw2649B-ms98-a-0052 247.134125 249.860875 having to throw it in the back of your car
sw2649B-ms98-a-0053 249.860875 266.605125 [silence]
sw2649B-ms98-a-0054 266.605125 268.416875 right right
sw2649B-ms98-a-0055 268.416875 275.762000 [silence]
sw2649B-ms98-a-0056 275.762000 284.898750 [laughter-yeah] way too much well i know just as an individual you know i know how many times i haul out a bag of trash and it's like incredible if you multiply that times everybody
sw2649B-ms98-a-0057 284.898750 288.411625 you know [laughter-on] my block in this city it's crazy
sw2649B-ms98-a-0058 288.411625 294.724625 [silence]
sw2649B-ms98-a-0059 294.724625 295.897125 right
sw2649B-ms98-a-0060 295.897125 297.089375 [silence]
sw2649B-ms98-a-0061 297.089375 299.389250 yeah you're TI right
sw2649B-ms98-a-0062 299.389250 300.499500 yeah so am i
sw2649B-ms98-a-0063 300.499500 308.940500 [silence]
sw2649B-ms98-a-0064 308.940500 310.649250 yeah it is
sw2649B-ms98-a-0065 310.649250 319.911000 i guess there's the other side of the issue that uh there need to be facilities for processing all this stuff and a market for recyclable goods
sw2649B-ms98-a-0066 319.911000 323.798000 and that was something they brought up on the show i listened to was uh
sw2649B-ms98-a-0067 323.798000 329.834750 you know there's all kinds of you know recycled paper but you know nobody's wanting to use it
sw2649B-ms98-a-0068 329.834750 334.508125 you know how many people are using how many people do you know that use recycled paper in the office
sw2649B-ms98-a-0069 334.508125 343.949000 you know you can you can buy your your Moore's computer forms for your computer paper or whatever you can buy it with regular paper or recycled and
sw2649B-ms98-a-0070 343.949000 348.610000 i'll guarantee you in my building i haven't seen recycled paper yet
sw2649B-ms98-a-0071 348.610000 356.422000 so at the same time we're we're doing all this effort to throw it a way and recycle it we ought to be working on the other end and
sw2649B-ms98-a-0072 356.422000 360.365375 and paying the extra dime on on a dollar for that recycled stuff
sw2649B-ms98-a-0073 360.365375 370.471750 [silence]
sw2649B-ms98-a-0074 370.471750 376.208250 well i think they actually do some of that but again it's the cost the cost of processing that it just
sw2649B-ms98-a-0075 376.208250 379.923875 it intimidates people you know it's easier to buy something that's
sw2649B-ms98-a-0076 379.923875 383.189875 you know the the the cost of building is already
sw2649B-ms98-a-0077 383.189875 385.090125 [silence]
sw2649B-ms98-a-0078 385.090125 386.579250 yeah
sw2649B-ms98-a-0079 386.579250 390.052125 for it it's easy to say but for a lot of people
sw2649B-ms98-a-0080 390.052125 397.520125 to do you know if you were building a house and you were going to spend you know fifty thousand versus twenty thousand on materials because your
sw2649B-ms98-a-0081 397.520125 401.754875 you're going to you're going to pay for uh technology that's not mature yet
