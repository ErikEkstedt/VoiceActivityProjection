sw2649A-ms98-a-0002 0.559875 8.065875 okay now uh the town i live in uh they started a recycling program
sw2649A-ms98-a-0003 8.065875 13.212875 uh in the certain small part of town a little couple neighb[orhoods]- neighborhoods
sw2649A-ms98-a-0004 13.212875 24.276625 and they said that they were disappointed in the response that people they tried to promote it and everything but i don't think the city necessarily supported what the they were doing uh
sw2649A-ms98-a-0005 24.276625 33.774625 yeah i don't think they really uh encouraged it i don't think they really uh made it well-known how to do it uh that's my perception
sw2649A-ms98-a-0006 33.774625 35.160375 but

sw2649A-ms98-a-0010 56.836250 68.643125 that has been taken away it's not there anymore i mean that thing was always full because people really brought stuff to it all the time and uh then they took it away for no real reason that i can understand or i ever heard about
sw2649A-ms98-a-0011 68.643125 76.000250 and it's not there anymore and the only place to take things to recycle them is like clear off on the other side of town and who's going to do that very few people

sw2649A-ms98-a-0024 149.181500 163.067000 uh newspapers or whatever i mean they used to be that if you well like grocery stores you buy uh pop and and you had a deposit on the bottle you bring the bottle back you get a nickel per bottle back or whatever you know that encourages you not to throw it away you'd take it back and and
sw2649A-ms98-a-0025 163.067000 166.957125 and get your money back or at least exchange it for another bottle that's full you know
