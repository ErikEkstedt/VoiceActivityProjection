sw2633A-ms98-a-0023 170.802375 175.832375 yeah i think that would take care of any questions about competency for people running the show
sw2633A-ms98-a-0024 175.832375 185.419875 uh if say if you were in the [vocalized-noise] in a situation having to locate a uh child care center how old you go about determining whether somebody was competent or not take care of your kids

sw2633A-ms98-a-0035 290.727250 299.562750 that are very expensive uh for uh typically subsidized by uh large companies for some of their uh uh important employees
sw2633A-ms98-a-0036 299.562750 313.010375 where if they can't get there regular uh sitter or a child care service to take there kids if they reserve slots with these other um companies um very expensive rates but they can drop their kid off uh at uh one of these places for
sw2633A-ms98-a-0037 313.010375 326.466375 so it i don't know what it cost but it's extremely expensive and the companies uh have to uh reserve X number of slots uh per year they can't send anymore it's it's pretty much for for their
sw2633A-ms98-a-0038 326.466375 337.749375 for their uh uh some some of their employees uh lawyers do that a lot um i've heard about this type of service in uh places like New York City where people are uh real busy but if uh
sw2633A-ms98-a-0039 337.749375 346.641375 if they can't find the regular sitter the[y]- they i[f]- if the company has uh slots available in this uh service uh these employees can drop their kids off there

sw2633A-ms98-a-0049 430.145000 441.425625 i guess you have to weigh the financial benefit of having somebody else take care of your kids if uh the working wife can uh make uh more than enough to handle that expense i guess it's worthwhile [laughter]
