sw2633B-ms98-a-0003 3.489375 15.438250 well about the only thing i know is uh one of my um friends at work uh has um one little boy and she's about to have a second baby and i hear some of her um
sw2633B-ms98-a-0004 15.438250 29.223375 tales about trying to get uh child care now she doesn't like to use some of the places like um Kinder Care La Petite Academy she likes to just find individuals you know who take children into their home
sw2633B-ms98-a-0005 29.223375 37.919500 and uh you know sometimes they have found somebody by word of mouth other times she has to go through the newspaper and see what she can find
sw2633B-ms98-a-0006 37.919500 46.340125 there are some um like um oh Chamber of Commerce you can kind of call there are some places like that that will give you some referrals at least
sw2633B-ms98-a-0007 46.340125 53.581375 but she just kind of goes and uh meets people that she sees advertise and and interviews with them and ask them their
sw2633B-ms98-a-0008 53.581375 54.988125 ways
sw2633B-ms98-a-0009 54.988125 57.437750 [silence]
sw2633B-ms98-a-0010 57.437750 58.659625 oh
sw2633B-ms98-a-0011 58.659625 62.333625 [silence]
sw2633B-ms98-a-0012 62.333625 63.683750 ah
sw2633B-ms98-a-0013 63.683750 69.848625 [silence]
sw2633B-ms98-a-0014 69.848625 78.010750 yeah there's been a few people that have kind of used the same person kind of like word of mouth one person in the department had them and
sw2633B-ms98-a-0015 78.010750 86.581250 then um you know other people had followed and had the same one as their child grows like some people only want little infants you know and when they get to two years old
sw2633B-ms98-a-0016 86.581250 97.166125 they don't want you know a whole lot of two years old because they're a little more active so they you know a lot people in the department seem to have used like the same couple of woman as their their children uh grow but
sw2633B-ms98-a-0017 97.166125 111.132000 i really keep thinking that T I ought to come up with something like through Texins to have you know some kind of facilities there at work because it really is uh a lot of extra pressure on our working parents
sw2633B-ms98-a-0018 111.132000 113.178000 [silence]
sw2633B-ms98-a-0019 113.178000 118.380375 no i think it should be done through Texans i mean i understand that
sw2633B-ms98-a-0020 118.380375 128.048250 that that TI wouldn't want to have liability for that and i can understand that i work in the legal department i don't want anymore lawsuits than what we got [laughter]
sw2633B-ms98-a-0021 128.048250 134.697000 but but you know i think that they could work out something with Texans something that would be close to work
sw2633B-ms98-a-0022 134.697000 142.968250 because i think that would help ease things too if you've got your child somewhere close because i see these people you know dashing out the door
sw2633B-ms98-a-0023 142.968250 154.330875 um have to be out by a certain time because they have to go pick up their child if they don't pick up the child by a certain time then they run extra money you know [noise] to uh have late charges
sw2633B-ms98-a-0024 154.330875 159.283500 and uh you know Texins is is not uh well i don't think it's
sw2633B-ms98-a-0025 159.283500 171.329125 really directly supported by TI i think it has it's own kind of funding but something like that that you know you would have to be a TI or a Texins kind of um does it
sw2633B-ms98-a-0026 171.329125 188.114500 [silence]
sw2633B-ms98-a-0027 188.114500 190.250375 well how would i do that
sw2633B-ms98-a-0028 190.250375 202.123125 [silence]
sw2633B-ms98-a-0029 202.123125 208.033125 well uh again i know from the person who um you know is a friend ever mine at work
sw2633B-ms98-a-0030 208.033125 222.478000 she and i i've talked to her after she's interviewed some people just really sound i mean bizarre i mean you can't imagine that these people are putting in for um you know minding others' children um like if you could go to the house and
sw2633B-ms98-a-0031 222.478000 232.873750 it seems to be in a disarray and the woman really isn't even dressed and it's afternoon and and you ask her about you know previous children and she won't talk about it [laughter]
sw2633B-ms98-a-0032 232.873750 235.782500 kind of go okay um
sw2633B-ms98-a-0033 235.782500 249.441625 others if they have some way of handling like i kind of wonder about these women who take in children there are times that you're going to have to do you know for the women they're going to have to do some personal things themselves i mean
sw2633B-ms98-a-0034 249.441625 259.373750 every single day they may have you know every once in a while they may have some kind of um personal doctor appointment or got to get the car fixed or something like that how do they do that
sw2633B-ms98-a-0035 259.373750 273.807625 so you ask them do you have a fall back you know for those times are you going to put me in a bind or do you have somebody else who can take care of the kids or do those things for you on the times that you need to you know have personal time off and do those items
sw2633B-ms98-a-0036 273.807625 288.408750 and ask them you know who else uh have they you know uh baby sat for in the past and can you talk to them look at the facilities and ask them what kind of things they do to you know during the day with the child that kind of thing i guess
sw2633B-ms98-a-0037 288.408750 295.926625 [silence]
sw2633B-ms98-a-0038 295.926625 297.116125 uh-huh
sw2633B-ms98-a-0039 297.116125 316.296250 [silence]

sw2633B-ms98-a-0046 346.655500 355.548500 hm oh do you know one time i um we just got married a couple of years ago and there was people that were coming you know into town with uh children
sw2633B-ms98-a-0047 355.548500 370.037500 and i wanted you know babysitters for uh the service and and available to them if they didn't want to bring their children or you know get away and stuff and i just called in the from the Yellow Pages you know uh babysitter uh outfits that are
sw2633B-ms98-a-0048 370.037500 377.324000 um again must have some kind of licensing or whatnot and uh just had them i mean
sw2633B-ms98-a-0049 377.324000 391.233125 what i did was i had a babysitter during the service you know and and um anybody who had children could just you know take the child to the nursery and i had somebody there everybody i knew was going to be at the wedding [laughter-so] [laughter-i] [laughter-knew] [laughter-i] [laughter-had] [laughter-to] [laughter-find] [laughter-somebody] [laughter-i] [laughter-didn't] know to do that
sw2633B-ms98-a-0050 391.233125 402.413750 um and it worked out okay i didn't know that there were services that you just called the Yellow Pages and uh there's [laughter-a] babysitters are us or [laughter-something] [laughter-and] [laughter-you] say please i need one you know oh yeah no problem we'll send you out one 
sw2633B-ms98-a-0051 402.413750 403.772375 [laughter]
sw2633B-ms98-a-0052 403.772375 408.578750 [silence]
sw2633B-ms98-a-0053 408.578750 411.298375 uh i
sw2633B-ms98-a-0054 411.298375 415.356875 thought i checked into it one time just pre planning
sw2633B-ms98-a-0055 415.356875 429.946500 and it can run like a hundred dollars a week i think my friend who now has a uh a two and a half year old she spends about fifty to sixty dollars per week for him so i think it's anywhere from like fifty to a hundred depending on the place you take
sw2633B-ms98-a-0056 429.946500 440.469125 [silence]
sw2633B-ms98-a-0057 440.469125 448.113000 yeah yeah it gets to be kind of expensive and i think you know some of the woman do uh weigh that um
sw2633B-ms98-a-0058 448.113000 460.573375 we've had some that have had their children and not come back so it just depends i think uh well we have one now who um is is part time she works uh half days [vocalized-noise] actually we have two one paralegal and one secretary
sw2633B-ms98-a-0059 460.573375 469.642500 and one attorney each have very young children and now they are part timing it is kind of like a test to see how this will work to have these people work part time
sw2633B-ms98-a-0060 469.642500 482.210000 uh depending on the responsibilities that we're giving them and to see how that will workout because they all want to you know still have a little income to help out financially but they want to spend time with their children so they're part timers
sw2633B-ms98-a-0061 482.210000 492.387375 and it for the one that's working with me it's working uh very well i don't have any problem with that i have one that's um helping me out at um for the litigation we're doing
sw2633B-ms98-a-0062 492.387375 500.562750 and she's there uh three days a week and this that seems to be fine i can handle that very well with her being there only half time
sw2633B-ms98-a-0063 500.562750 504.862375 [silence]
sw2633B-ms98-a-0064 504.862375 509.266375 [laughter-next] [laughter-week]
sw2633B-ms98-a-0065 509.266375 518.049125 [silence]
sw2633B-ms98-a-0066 518.049125 519.310125 [laughter]
sw2633B-ms98-a-0067 519.310125 520.332250 [silence]
sw2633B-ms98-a-0068 520.332250 521.593250 oh
sw2633B-ms98-a-0069 521.593250 524.753625 [silence]
sw2633B-ms98-a-0070 524.753625 532.579000 yeah well it's whatever they feel comfortable with you know basically whatever they feel best and there's probably some women who
sw2633B-ms98-a-0071 532.579000 541.356625 may not do their child any good being there all the time because you know they they they can't uh quite see themselves you know dedicated that much
sw2633B-ms98-a-0072 541.356625 550.994250 maybe they want to work a little bit whatever it is maybe they should think about do you really want a child or not [laughter]
sw2633B-ms98-a-0073 550.994250 559.429875 and maybe again you know their their you know their ideas change once the baby is there they go oh well you know now i like this a lot more than i thought i would
sw2633B-ms98-a-0074 559.429875 569.650375 but uh Cathlene the part timer she says you know she just doesn't she she's always one of these workaholic kind of people and she just really can't sit still enough
sw2633B-ms98-a-0075 569.650375 575.751750 to just be home with the baby she has to have you know something else she's always been one who's put in
sw2633B-ms98-a-0076 575.751750 588.643500 you know like the fifty to sixty hour work week and after she had the baby she was coming back in to check her office and to check her in box you know like ten days later she was back in and we were like Cathlene you got two months off you know you don't have to be back in there she's just
sw2633B-ms98-a-0077 588.643500 599.521125 always back in there and she's a she she just finds it very hard to um you know tone that down even though she's a part timer she still will put in time on Saturday
