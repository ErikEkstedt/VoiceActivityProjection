sw2658A-ms98-a-0005 19.711500 20.803500 [silence]
sw2658A-ms98-a-0006 20.803500 30.146250 yeah well we could talk about that and then we could talk a bit about um just quality of products in general if you they're better or worse like if they last longer or something like that

sw2658A-ms98-a-0017 56.994125 58.493375 there you go
sw2658A-ms98-a-0018 58.493375 59.495625 [silence]
sw2658A-ms98-a-0019 59.495625 60.765750 okay
sw2658A-ms98-a-0020 60.765750 61.995125 yeah
sw2658A-ms98-a-0021 61.995125 63.495000 right
sw2658A-ms98-a-0022 63.495000 71.270750 [silence]
sw2658A-ms98-a-0023 71.270750 76.753000 well we bought a computer because_1 my husband needed to use it to do some
sw2658A-ms98-a-0024 76.753000 86.656750 work for a consulting project and we called up the company and asked them details on it we bought it sort of your not a name brand because the clones are so much cheaper
sw2658A-ms98-a-0025 86.656750 99.999875 and we called up the company that somebody else we knew had dealt with and they were very happy with the system and they felt they've gotten a good price and we went in we explained what we needed and yes we had to go across the George Washington Bridge to New Jersey [laughter] to get
sw2658A-ms98-a-0026 99.999875 101.618625 to meet these people
sw2658A-ms98-a-0027 101.618625 105.497500 and so we went there we told them about the stuff and the guy said
sw2658A-ms98-a-0028 105.497500 117.170375 uh that the computer would fit our needs and we [laughter] these things won't make any sense to you probably but he told us there were we need user positions to put our own equipment in the computer
sw2658A-ms98-a-0029 117.170375 121.369125 and it's called a user boards or slots is what it's called
sw2658A-ms98-a-0030 121.369125 134.996000 and he told us there's two sixteen bit slots and two eight bit sorry two six[teen]- s[ixteen]- four sixteen bit slots and two eight bit slots available for the user and we can put full size cards in there and so we said great you know we'll buy it and we put in our order
sw2658A-ms98-a-0031 134.996000 144.050750 and a week later we went back and picked up the computer and then we got it home and tried to put our own board in it and there's only one slot we could put it in
sw2658A-ms98-a-0032 144.050750 153.757875 and at this point we only have one board so it wasn't so bad so we used it a bit but we tried to figure out whether we could put three in because_1 we really need to be able to put at least three in
sw2658A-ms98-a-0033 153.757875 155.262875 and
sw2658A-ms98-a-0034 155.262875 156.780625 [silence]
sw2658A-ms98-a-0035 156.780625 162.662250 well it has them but the problem is that you can't put the type of card that we need to put in it in it
sw2658A-ms98-a-0036 162.662250 170.184375 and even though they told us in advance that you could they told us there'd be no problem because_1 you know the salesman just doesn't really know
sw2658A-ms98-a-0037 170.184375 172.691500 [silence]
sw2658A-ms98-a-0038 172.691500 179.498500 right that's completely it the salesman didn't know so we went back in and we struck an agreement with the people they'd change
sw2658A-ms98-a-0039 179.498500 184.499000 the casing it comes in so that we could put in extra boards
sw2658A-ms98-a-0040 184.499000 197.497500 okay so they did that and we said are you sure that this will work we don't want you to go through the work and then find out that this doesn't really work anyway and etcetera and they're and they were doing it at their own costs and so we said fine
sw2658A-ms98-a-0041 197.497500 204.244750 and we went back and we talked to the technical person a second time and things like that and then we come
sw2658A-ms98-a-0042 204.244750 216.247625 we get the computer home my husband goes to pick it up last week and we couldn't go get it sooner because_1 i just had the baby and [laughter] you know life's just a little bit complicated and uh he goes and gets it brings it home first of all they're missing
sw2658A-ms98-a-0043 216.247625 225.890625 components of it like cables so you can't really test it out and then second thing we still can't put the boards in because they have other things blocking where we need to do it
sw2658A-ms98-a-0044 225.890625 238.188625 and see now we're dealing with having to bring it back again and they say they can you know do something different and change some connectors and we hope so but it's a hassle you kn[ow]- you know it's just this problem with sales people just not knowing
sw2658A-ms98-a-0045 238.188625 240.265125 what goes on
sw2658A-ms98-a-0046 240.265125 242.792000 [silence]
sw2658A-ms98-a-0047 242.792000 244.304875 right
sw2658A-ms98-a-0048 244.304875 245.478875 [silence]
sw2658A-ms98-a-0049 245.478875 255.990375 so well actually some things are pretty good with that because i put it on a gold credit card and i just called the credit card company and explained to them the situation and they said well you don't have to pay for it yet
sw2658A-ms98-a-0050 255.990375 257.798875 y[es]- yes
sw2658A-ms98-a-0051 257.798875 262.992500 [silence]
sw2658A-ms98-a-0052 262.992500 264.276250 yeah
sw2658A-ms98-a-0053 264.276250 265.791625 [silence]
sw2658A-ms98-a-0054 265.791625 268.193375 right and so you know
sw2658A-ms98-a-0055 268.193375 278.672750 well because_1 these guys if they um give us a hard time we're going to say you look you know if y[ou]- if you can't fix this to our satisfaction we're just returning the computer
sw2658A-ms98-a-0056 278.672750 289.979375 and if we do that i just tell the credit card company don't pay the charge even though they've already paid it but they'll just you know undo the credit that they did to them
sw2658A-ms98-a-0057 289.979375 291.488750 yeah
sw2658A-ms98-a-0058 291.488750 292.782625 [silence]
sw2658A-ms98-a-0059 292.782625 294.256250 right [laughter]

sw2658A-ms98-a-0071 371.783750 374.684500 what brand is it do you know
sw2658A-ms98-a-0072 374.684500 377.994750 [silence]
sw2658A-ms98-a-0073 377.994750 385.732375 but i was wondering like you know in our case we we knew we were buying a copy we weren't buying an IBM PC and i was wondering if you
sw2658A-ms98-a-0074 385.732375 389.406125 [silence]
sw2658A-ms98-a-0075 389.406125 391.174375 [noise]

sw2658A-ms98-a-0079 407.496625 412.442125 [laughter-Highlands] [laughter-because] [laughter-it's] [laughter-obviously] a chain down there that i don't know up here nope
sw2658A-ms98-a-0080 412.442125 415.708625 [silence]
sw2658A-ms98-a-0081 415.708625 417.153750 uh-huh
sw2658A-ms98-a-0082 417.153750 428.540000 [silence]
sw2658A-ms98-a-0083 428.540000 430.997750 i think a lot of things are not made as well
sw2658A-ms98-a-0084 430.997750 432.292875 [silence]
sw2658A-ms98-a-0085 432.292875 435.279625 um oh we[ll]- [noise]
sw2658A-ms98-a-0086 435.279625 440.994875 gosh it's hard to think of an exact example but i think that um
sw2658A-ms98-a-0087 440.994875 443.321250 [silence]
sw2658A-ms98-a-0088 443.321250 452.745875 i ju[st]- yeah i just have uh well i like electronic stuff you know for one thing i know their work you know cars i think are not made as well as they could be 
sw2658A-ms98-a-0089 452.745875 457.771500 um because i they want people to replace it after a couple of years
sw2658A-ms98-a-0090 457.771500 471.253875 [silence]
sw2658A-ms98-a-0091 471.253875 472.971625 um-hum

sw2658A-ms98-a-0095 487.977875 489.251125 good
sw2658A-ms98-a-0096 489.251125 490.818500 [silence]
sw2658A-ms98-a-0097 490.818500 492.156500 yeah
sw2658A-ms98-a-0098 492.156500 497.301250 [silence]
sw2658A-ms98-a-0099 497.301250 507.988750 well i i think part of the problem comes in sort of shoddy workmanship the people just don't care about what they're doing you know the whole nobody cares no[body's]- nobody's really paying
sw2658A-ms98-a-0100 507.988750 511.481250 [silence]
sw2658A-ms98-a-0101 511.481250 514.634875 right give me my paycheck so i can go home
sw2658A-ms98-a-0102 514.634875 525.159250 [silence]
sw2658A-ms98-a-0103 525.159250 526.634750 yeah

sw2658A-ms98-a-0105 533.795375 542.495125 yeah and also i think well i do research and so i'm used to sort of being underpaid for wh[atever]- whatever work
sw2658A-ms98-a-0106 542.495125 545.170000 gets done but
sw2658A-ms98-a-0107 545.170000 548.498000 and you get satisfaction out of it and
sw2658A-ms98-a-0108 548.498000 553.020000 [silence]
sw2658A-ms98-a-0109 553.020000 556.490500 but i think a lot of it you know i think things come both from the
sw2658A-ms98-a-0110 556.490500 562.166250 uh individual side and also from the company side because the companies that let
sw2658A-ms98-a-0111 562.166250 576.921500 give the attitude that well you know you're the last one hired so you'll be the first one fired and we just want you to do your days work and we don't really care about you as an individual when you've got that type of attitude on the people don't care about their work and so
sw2658A-ms98-a-0112 576.921500 593.972875 [silence]
sw2658A-ms98-a-0113 593.972875 596.671875 little value just in whatever you do
sw2658A-ms98-a-0114 596.671875 598.701875 doing a good job of it
