sw2658B-ms98-a-0032 157.501125 161.288125 [silence]
sw2658B-ms98-a-0033 161.288125 163.230875 oh i see

sw2658B-ms98-a-0035 167.485625 168.992750 oh i see
sw2658B-ms98-a-0036 168.992750 173.725750 in some ways it has more to do with the people who sold it they probably didn't know what they were talking about
sw2658B-ms98-a-0037 173.725750 174.824250 [silence]
sw2658B-ms98-a-0038 174.824250 176.309250 right

sw2658B-ms98-a-0049 233.678250 235.994500 yeah it really is
sw2658B-ms98-a-0050 235.994500 239.236125 [silence]
sw2658B-ms98-a-0051 239.236125 246.970250 right and t[ime]- and so much time goes past before you finally get any kind of satisfaction i think that's the worst part uh i
sw2658B-ms98-a-0052 246.970250 254.702000 [silence]
sw2658B-ms98-a-0053 254.702000 265.969125 now that's an advantage isn't it it really is i think uh uh there's a lot not to be said for credit but that's one thing to be said for credit it how it gets you some muscle where you need it
sw2658B-ms98-a-0054 265.969125 268.966125 and i think that's r[eally]- really important
sw2658B-ms98-a-0055 268.966125 276.490250 [silence]
sw2658B-ms98-a-0056 276.490250 277.815125 yeah
sw2658B-ms98-a-0057 277.815125 280.283875 that's right that's right
sw2658B-ms98-a-0058 280.283875 283.489500 [silence]
sw2658B-ms98-a-0059 283.489500 286.498000 that's right no
sw2658B-ms98-a-0060 286.498000 288.577500 yeah they will
sw2658B-ms98-a-0061 288.577500 300.256125 that's right they will they will put the kind of clout on them_1 that you can't really do yeah we Hal bought me uh uh small uh well uh uh
sw2658B-ms98-a-0062 300.256125 301.255875 [silence]
sw2658B-ms98-a-0063 301.255875 315.940000 little jam box kind of thing so i'd my i have my ninety three year old mother living with us and so i uh she doesn't remember anything but to keep her entertained music and some of these things do help and i thought well if i had uh a ni[ce]- a nice little uh
sw2658B-ms98-a-0064 315.940000 327.494250 tape recorder you know so that i could put some good music on in there for her every once in a while and then also so that i can uh uh copy uh
sw2658B-ms98-a-0065 327.494250 339.994500 parts off i i do some musicals and things like this and if i can copy sections off that i can use someplace so i figured well this'll be good well the first uh uh the first time i turned it on
sw2658B-ms98-a-0066 339.994500 347.032625 uh i was recording and the next thing i knew the tape was chewed up in the thing
sw2658B-ms98-a-0067 347.032625 354.945375 okay so after that then you couldn't get a [noise] you couldn't get a tape to play at the right speed in that side
sw2658B-ms98-a-0068 354.945375 368.558125 and then on the other side when i when i uh i loa[ned]- loaned it to my daughter the other day to take it over to a to a videotaping they were doing and uh she says it's wrong too because the little thing pokes out too far and so you can't
sw2658B-ms98-a-0069 368.558125 379.726375 y[ou]- you can't get it to run the right the right way either so uh yeah so i [laughter-i] wish i could tell you i really don't know which brand it is uh
sw2658B-ms98-a-0070 379.726375 382.669375 [silence]
sw2658B-ms98-a-0071 382.669375 397.474250 yeah no i think this is a i think this is maybe a name brand and i suspect that it's probably just a fluke you know i have the papers and everything and we're going to get just take it back but uh
sw2658B-ms98-a-0072 397.474250 405.420375 yeah i think just uh just uh one of the ma[jor]- major i think it was a you know i don't i think it was uh
sw2658B-ms98-a-0073 405.420375 408.484250 you know like a Highlands or something like this
sw2658B-ms98-a-0074 408.484250 409.700750 [silence]
sw2658B-ms98-a-0075 409.700750 411.691250 do they have Highlands up there
sw2658B-ms98-a-0076 411.691250 422.686375 don't they well this is it was a regular uh electronics s[tore]- store you know so i don't think i don't think there'll be too much problem but i i guess i'm not sure whether i think
sw2658B-ms98-a-0077 422.686375 427.928000 things are not made as well i think they deliberately sometimes
sw2658B-ms98-a-0078 427.928000 429.263500 um
sw2658B-ms98-a-0079 429.263500 430.311875 [silence]
sw2658B-ms98-a-0080 430.311875 433.486875 don't you what what for instance what are you
sw2658B-ms98-a-0081 433.486875 436.999750 [silence]
sw2658B-ms98-a-0082 436.999750 438.297250 yeah
sw2658B-ms98-a-0083 438.297250 440.711000 [silence]
sw2658B-ms98-a-0084 440.711000 444.489750 they just get they're getting a kind of a attitude of not
sw2658B-ms98-a-0085 444.489750 446.506750 [silence]
sw2658B-ms98-a-0086 446.506750 447.738250 yeah
sw2658B-ms98-a-0087 447.738250 450.262500 [silence]
sw2658B-ms98-a-0088 450.262500 451.995625 well c[ars]-
sw2658B-ms98-a-0089 451.995625 455.772000 yeah yeah i think that's right the fact that
sw2658B-ms98-a-0090 455.772000 464.693375 right the fact that they that they ha[ve]- have competition with the Japanese and whatnot sometimes uh dwells on a fact that
sw2658B-ms98-a-0091 464.693375 477.281875 you know uh i've had i've known people who have had Toyotas for years that have had almost no repair work to do on them_1 well they may cost a little more but they don't have to take them_1 to the shop every other day
sw2658B-ms98-a-0092 477.281875 478.498250 yeah
sw2658B-ms98-a-0093 478.498250 486.788750 yeah it does the they do a good job so part of it is that we need to develop more of a of a pride in
sw2658B-ms98-a-0094 486.788750 491.498875 in uh the kinds of things we do so we make them_1 better
sw2658B-ms98-a-0095 491.498875 499.250625 and it kind of has to start from the top a[nd]- and go clea[r]- or from the bottom maybe and go clear up people
sw2658B-ms98-a-0096 499.250625 501.993750 [silence]
sw2658B-ms98-a-0097 501.993750 504.506250 no no
sw2658B-ms98-a-0098 504.506250 505.999625 [silence]
sw2658B-ms98-a-0099 505.999625 507.499750 yeah
sw2658B-ms98-a-0100 507.499750 518.996125 attitude is is just get me my dollar so i can go do what i want to do and [vocalized-noise] on what i'm doing right i think that's too bad and it's a shame too because um
sw2658B-ms98-a-0101 518.996125 527.941500 when you get right down to it most things there isn't any if you do a good job nobody can pay you enough [laughter] there isn't any way to get paid enough
sw2658B-ms98-a-0102 527.941500 534.716750 but i[f]- if you do a good job you feel enough satisfaction so whatever you're paid is enough
sw2658B-ms98-a-0103 534.716750 543.205125 [silence]
sw2658B-ms98-a-0104 543.205125 544.695250 uh-huh
sw2658B-ms98-a-0105 544.695250 546.755000 [silence]
sw2658B-ms98-a-0106 546.755000 553.723000 that's right i think they underestimate how much how much value the satisfaction is
sw2658B-ms98-a-0107 553.723000 566.437500 [silence]
sw2658B-ms98-a-0108 566.437500 567.968125 no
sw2658B-ms98-a-0109 567.968125 568.974000 [silence]
sw2658B-ms98-a-0110 568.974000 570.995875 yeah yeah
sw2658B-ms98-a-0111 570.995875 573.986875 [silence]
sw2658B-ms98-a-0112 573.986875 582.997375 yeah it probab[ly]- it probably basically goes right back into the h[ome]- home though unfortunately starts with the one person that
sw2658B-ms98-a-0113 582.997375 589.468625 you know and so you need to really work hard at helping your kids to understand that
sw2658B-ms98-a-0114 589.468625 592.696625 there is value just in work for itself
sw2658B-ms98-a-0115 592.696625 595.806625 without any pay you know
sw2658B-ms98-a-0116 595.806625 599.903625 yeah the the the that the value is in doing it well and
