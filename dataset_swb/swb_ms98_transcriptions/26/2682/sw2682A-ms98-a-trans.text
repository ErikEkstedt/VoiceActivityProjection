sw2682A-ms98-a-0078 310.978875 325.466125 applications for them all the time i think uh once a week i have an application and the first thing i check for is if there's an annual fee if there's an annual fee i ditch it because i don't use them that often so it wouldn't even pay me to get it even if it was you know
sw2682A-ms98-a-0079 325.466125 332.279250 and uh my Discover card i have no annual fee and my mom like i started using mine and i told my mom about it
sw2682A-ms98-a-0080 332.279250 347.248875 and now she buys everything with her Dis[cover]- Discover card and she works it the way you do with your card she writes it down like she would a check and then you know and that way she's getting the interest on it too because_1 then a[t]- at the end of the year they give her back her interest
sw2682A-ms98-a-0081 347.248875 350.996250 and i think she got back like fifty some dollars last year
