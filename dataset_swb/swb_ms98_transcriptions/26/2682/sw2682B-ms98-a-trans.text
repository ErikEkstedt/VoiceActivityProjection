sw2682B-ms98-a-0016 36.976875 41.994625 well i use um a credit card that's given out by US Air
sw2682B-ms98-a-0017 41.994625 53.236875 well not given out i mean there's an annual fee um and the neat thing about the credit card is for every dollar that you charge you get one frequent flyer mile
sw2682B-ms98-a-0018 53.236875 58.896750 and um [vocalized-noise] my husband and i tend to charge a lot
sw2682B-ms98-a-0019 58.896750 73.752125 and even things that we wouldn't normally charge now we charge because we've racked up seriously close in the past couple years close to five or six thousand dollars just by charging 
sw2682B-ms98-a-0020 73.752125 81.817000 and um it's really great because you can get some good discounts um on US Air you know using frequent flyer mileage and all that
sw2682B-ms98-a-0021 81.817000 86.989625 um and the annual fee isn't bad i think it's maybe thirty five dollars a year
sw2682B-ms98-a-0022 86.989625 95.220000 um and here in Rochester maybe in in Pennsylvania also but you can charge your groceries
sw2682B-ms98-a-0023 95.220000 96.807375 can you do that there
sw2682B-ms98-a-0024 96.807375 98.488125 which is great

sw2682B-ms98-a-0029 111.784625 113.999250 um-hum yeah
sw2682B-ms98-a-0030 113.999250 125.693875 well i love it and now um actually our our mortgage company is uh starting i think June first or something is going to start allowing people to charge their mortgage 
sw2682B-ms98-a-0031 125.693875 128.497875 and that's going to be great
sw2682B-ms98-a-0032 128.497875 135.262375 um and in the beginning we were having a problem because we would charge everything and then get this enormous bill
sw2682B-ms98-a-0033 135.262375 140.253375 and just be totally wiped out because one thing i hate is paying interest 
sw2682B-ms98-a-0034 140.253375 145.269375 i refuse to pay interest if i'm going to do that i'm not going to use a credit card
sw2682B-ms98-a-0035 145.269375 152.280500 so what i do now is i- i work it like a checkbook and every time i charge something i write it [rout/out] i write it out
sw2682B-ms98-a-0036 152.280500 155.981000 so i'm not fooling myself into thinking i have that money
sw2682B-ms98-a-0037 155.981000 160.286125 you know i write it out and then it's it's as if i paid in cash
sw2682B-ms98-a-0038 160.286125 163.983625 so you're somebody that will pay off your bills right away

sw2682B-ms98-a-0067 235.705000 236.988000 seem
sw2682B-ms98-a-0068 236.988000 245.498375 um-hum it's definitely worth it if you pay off your bills in full then credit cards are a real good idea 
sw2682B-ms98-a-0069 245.498375 254.786625 because you don't have to carry a whole lot of cash and you get the interest you know if you charge at the beginning of the month then you're getting a month's worth of interest
sw2682B-ms98-a-0070 254.786625 256.266750 in your account
sw2682B-ms98-a-0071 256.266750 268.728875 um but the second you let it go even one month um they had made an error on our statement where they they never posted the payment yet i had the canceled check i had everything 
sw2682B-ms98-a-0072 268.728875 274.470000 and um i mean for that amount it was like a thirty dollar interest charge
sw2682B-ms98-a-0073 274.470000 279.255000 that's like another purchase for me it buying something
sw2682B-ms98-a-0074 279.255000 293.898125 yeah but um you know one thing one of the reasons because_1 i have some of those cards that you mentioned and i think about it and and a lot of reason i have those cards is because J C Penney offered you know a free gift if you buy it 
sw2682B-ms98-a-0075 293.898125 299.467750 yeah or five dollars off this purchase if you you know sign up and
sw2682B-ms98-a-0076 299.467750 304.133000 and uh as long as it because_1 i don't J C Penney doesn't cost you anything i don't think

sw2682B-ms98-a-0078 305.154000 308.280500 right and so as long as it doesn't cost you anything then

sw2682B-ms98-a-0105 372.995000 378.290125 how you can borrow money off a credit card i still haven't quite figured that out 
sw2682B-ms98-a-0106 378.290125 379.335875 [silence]
sw2682B-ms98-a-0107 379.335875 388.993875 i know i don't trust it either and um i know you can do it with a Visa card but it just seems like too simple and i know that there's some hidden

sw2682B-ms98-a-0114 398.508625 401.231125 oh just yeah the machine
sw2682B-ms98-a-0115 401.231125 407.480000 one thing that um that does scare me a little bit about my credit card is when i am giving it over the phone
sw2682B-ms98-a-0116 407.480000 417.772250 or you know if i- i- i tend to buy a lot of things from TV like not not the shopper's thing but sometimes they'll be something good that they're selling a record or something like that and um
sw2682B-ms98-a-0117 417.772250 421.498000 and after i do it i think God who did i give my number to
sw2682B-ms98-a-0118 421.498000 426.628000 and um you know what are they going to do with it how can i trust them or whatever
sw2682B-ms98-a-0119 426.628000 427.732875 [silence]
sw2682B-ms98-a-0120 427.732875 435.980375 but um the credit card company i did have a charge on there once that i had no receipt for i had no recollection i didn't even know the the store
sw2682B-ms98-a-0121 435.980375 446.749250 and they took it right off no questions i just said this isn't my charge if you can prove that it is then great if you can't then um you know just take it off

sw2682B-ms98-a-0128 460.986500 463.980000 yeah they would pursue it definitely

sw2682B-ms98-a-0136 485.222000 494.234125 right yeah that's true before you could at least deduct if you did pay any interest you could at least deduct that from your taxes
sw2682B-ms98-a-0137 494.234125 497.668500 but now you can't do it and i know people that have racked up
sw2682B-ms98-a-0138 497.668500 502.688875 they k[eep]- they keep getting their limit extended because they keep exceeding it 
sw2682B-ms98-a-0139 502.688875 508.231000 and then and all they can do is is pay the minimum balance or not that you know

sw2682B-ms98-a-0150 541.987000 550.681000 oh yeah some people are they really are i mean if if they have if they know they have m[ore]- more on their limit

sw2682B-ms98-a-0152 559.994000 567.839625 he can't because_1 to him it's like money to him it's like a a loan almost in a sense and he can't bear to
