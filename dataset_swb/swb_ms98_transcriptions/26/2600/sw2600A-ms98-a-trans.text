sw2600A-ms98-a-0114 432.030000 439.143750 well it's sort of like North Carolina North Carolina has an interesting thing on their income tax uh they create
sw2600A-ms98-a-0115 439.143750 440.311250 money
sw2600A-ms98-a-0116 440.311250 443.421625 to tax you with or to tax you on
sw2600A-ms98-a-0117 443.421625 446.802875 there's a neat little formula on the back that you have to complete
sw2600A-ms98-a-0118 446.802875 459.389625 and assuming you're you're you're at poverty line where you're uh deduction or you take the standard deduction of thirty two fifty uh that will work out to an additional three hundred dollars
sw2600A-ms98-a-0119 459.389625 462.584625 tacked on to your taxable income
sw2600A-ms98-a-0120 462.584625 467.274875 yeah and of course it goes higher and higher the more money you make
sw2600A-ms98-a-0121 467.274875 476.685125 but the very least that anybody filing income tax form will have to pay on is three hundred dollars and they create money out of thin air
sw2600A-ms98-a-0122 476.685125 484.474750 i wr[ote]- i- i attached a little note to my my return when i sent it in saying gee i didn't know i had this extra three hundred dollars i wonder where it went

sw2600A-ms98-a-0127 509.346375 515.252625 and i always thought well this is pretty nifty you taxed me when i made the money the feds
sw2600A-ms98-a-0128 515.252625 527.537500 yeah the feds took it out and now they're giving it back to me and now you're going to tax it again i s[eem]- i seem to rec[all]- recall something about revolutions and wars about double and triple taxation and stuff
sw2600A-ms98-a-0129 527.537500 533.106125 course uh course it it's the by word now i mean let let's tax everything three or four times
