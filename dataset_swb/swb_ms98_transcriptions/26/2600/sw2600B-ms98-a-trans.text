sw2600B-ms98-a-0047 157.098750 160.437125 yeah well on the other side of the fence
sw2600B-ms98-a-0048 160.437125 164.065125 [noise] the way it works is that uh
sw2600B-ms98-a-0049 164.065125 167.029625 some employers
sw2600B-ms98-a-0050 167.029625 171.981000 although they have a qualified pension plan they don't have a
sw2600B-ms98-a-0051 171.981000 174.180500 viable pension plan
sw2600B-ms98-a-0052 174.180500 175.616875 [silence]

sw2600B-ms98-a-0068 214.251375 215.833500 well we have
sw2600B-ms98-a-0069 215.833500 218.112250 [silence]
sw2600B-ms98-a-0070 218.112250 224.877500 we have had some medical reti[re]- i mean some military retirees work up here for us 
sw2600B-ms98-a-0071 224.877500 226.930125 or a bunch really and
sw2600B-ms98-a-0072 226.930125 230.500375 they did use the heck out of the medical
sw2600B-ms98-a-0073 230.500375 232.266500 military medical
sw2600B-ms98-a-0074 232.266500 235.403000 now the military dental was poor
sw2600B-ms98-a-0075 235.403000 237.257625 at best
sw2600B-ms98-a-0076 237.257625 240.358625 but the medical seemed
sw2600B-ms98-a-0077 240.358625 241.649750 [silence]
sw2600B-ms98-a-0078 241.649750 243.177125 somewhat adequate
sw2600B-ms98-a-0079 243.177125 271.137625 [silence]
sw2600B-ms98-a-0080 271.137625 272.508250 yeah yeah
sw2600B-ms98-a-0081 272.508250 274.000625 [silence]
sw2600B-ms98-a-0082 274.000625 277.676250 yeah uh i'm a member of an HMO
sw2600B-ms98-a-0083 277.676250 284.691625 and uh from all indications it's quite similar to the military
sw2600B-ms98-a-0084 284.691625 287.655500 [silence]
sw2600B-ms98-a-0085 287.655500 289.114250 yeah exactly and

sw2600B-ms98-a-0087 296.185500 297.667125 and
sw2600B-ms98-a-0088 297.667125 299.445375 so
sw2600B-ms98-a-0089 299.445375 305.888125 the single benefits that i consider among the most important are medical insurance
sw2600B-ms98-a-0090 305.888125 309.455125 because without it you can be
sw2600B-ms98-a-0091 309.455125 312.095625 broke for the rest of your life
sw2600B-ms98-a-0092 312.095625 322.900500 [silence]

sw2600B-ms98-a-0094 324.474375 328.087250 yes and the funny thing is that uh
sw2600B-ms98-a-0095 328.087250 332.237750 private medical insurance is grossly expensive
sw2600B-ms98-a-0096 332.237750 333.900000 if you are not a member of a group
sw2600B-ms98-a-0097 333.900000 340.082125 [silence]
sw2600B-ms98-a-0098 340.082125 341.023250 uh-huh

sw2600B-ms98-a-0102 349.985625 352.085375 well you get what you pay for don't you
sw2600B-ms98-a-0103 352.085375 361.238625 [silence]
sw2600B-ms98-a-0104 361.238625 363.278625 doesn't cover doctors

sw2600B-ms98-a-0106 378.634750 382.402250 are you covered yes are you covered really no

sw2600B-ms98-a-0108 387.003250 387.812375 so

sw2600B-ms98-a-0110 392.162625 394.251000 yes it

sw2600B-ms98-a-0114 403.965125 412.764875 in our state currently when in Colorado whenever you fill out uh your state income tax
sw2600B-ms98-a-0115 412.764875 417.935125 they ask you if you have medical insurance if you do
sw2600B-ms98-a-0116 417.935125 422.682750 you have to pay for those that don't have medical insurance
sw2600B-ms98-a-0117 422.682750 423.980500 [silence]
sw2600B-ms98-a-0118 423.980500 429.475250 i think it's two or four dollars a person i don't remember something along those lines but it
sw2600B-ms98-a-0119 429.475250 431.888625 still the idea irks me so that
sw2600B-ms98-a-0120 431.888625 454.948750 [silence]
sw2600B-ms98-a-0121 454.948750 456.016500 right

sw2600B-ms98-a-0127 487.143625 491.099750 uh Colorado is a nifty thing if you
sw2600B-ms98-a-0128 491.099750 494.589500 or they did until last year
sw2600B-ms98-a-0129 494.589500 499.884625 in times past if you got a federal tax
sw2600B-ms98-a-0130 499.884625 501.239875 refund
sw2600B-ms98-a-0131 501.239875 503.258750 [silence]
sw2600B-ms98-a-0132 503.258750 507.092375 you paid state income tax on it the next year
sw2600B-ms98-a-0133 507.092375 514.465625 [silence]
sw2600B-ms98-a-0134 514.465625 517.229250 and now you're taxing me again on it

sw2600B-ms98-a-0150 576.078000 580.592375 [noise] i think they are [noise] sorely mistaken
