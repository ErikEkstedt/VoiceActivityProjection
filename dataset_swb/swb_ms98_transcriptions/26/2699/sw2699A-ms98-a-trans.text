sw2699A-ms98-a-0019 60.445750 74.362250 i've always heard that the foreign cars are are the you know foreign cars or the Toyota and Nissan they have good mileage it's better and they last and last my mother has a Toyota and she's she's going on about a hundred and fifty thousand miles
sw2699A-ms98-a-0020 74.362250 78.359375 on it and it's still trucking so i [laughter] she's sticking with it
sw2699A-ms98-a-0021 78.359375 85.939750 um i think i probably want uh a kind of a sportier car the one i have now is gray and i like black
sw2699A-ms98-a-0022 85.939750 94.325750 and probably like tinted windows and a nice stereo system tape player i don't have a tape player in mine which is really killing me

sw2699A-ms98-a-0031 109.323250 122.811625 right the problem with that in Waco is there's not many stations and so you pretty much depend on tapes [laughter] and CDs etcetera and so on because there's not a whole lot of stations to listen to um
sw2699A-ms98-a-0032 122.811625 124.323500 what

sw2699A-ms98-a-0034 130.509750 139.583250 um my personal car i usually just drive to work and back or to the mall or something but not a whole lot i do drive back and forth to Dallas a lot in that car
sw2699A-ms98-a-0035 139.583250 142.400500 and that's probably wearing it down quite a bit

sw2699A-ms98-a-0097 328.641750 341.374000 and it completely shut down it wouldn't it just started going it went in drive and just kept driving i would put it in rear it kept going straight so i just drove it to the Nissan place and they said that it looked like i'd bumped something underneath the car
sw2699A-ms98-a-0098 341.374000 352.803625 and i knew i hadn't bumped anything but i had taken it to Sears for an oil change a couple of days before and i'm thinking they did took a screw out or bumped something or something and
