sw2641B-ms98-a-0033 119.072000 121.456125 yeah i house sat some cats
sw2641B-ms98-a-0034 121.456125 133.533875 for a friend of mine which she was finishing up her thesis and what we used to do was just put um newspaper on the bottom and then put cat litter and then i would just take the whole thing to the garbage can and dump the whole thing
sw2641B-ms98-a-0035 133.533875 147.583750 then i would do it you know everyday or two days so i would clean that pan very very rarely and so it wasn't so bad well she had two cats and just as easy it just never started smelling i would put just a little bit of cat litter there
sw2641B-ms98-a-0036 147.583750 159.392500 because if i put a lot one of the [laughter-cats] would had [laughter-been] all of her animals that she ever had were adopted is that true yeah she's even got she's got one dog now and the two cats and her
sw2641B-ms98-a-0037 159.392500 173.435375 dog there is is basically a reject somebody had bought him and wanted him it was her ex boyfriend and you know just was not mature enough to keep the dog didn't realize how much work it was and now she's stuck with it and she's just so kindhearted that she just takes all the animals
sw2641B-ms98-a-0038 173.435375 182.483875 but i think that for me well my husband just has completely nixed the idea of having a dog or a [laughter-cat] [laughter-because] that's all there is to it so you know
sw2641B-ms98-a-0039 182.483875 184.447250 no we don't have anything right now
sw2641B-ms98-a-0040 184.447250 190.827625 oh right [laughter] now we have a kid but he was no completely against having a dog or cat he said they're much

sw2641B-ms98-a-0049 221.639750 231.848000 and if they go away they have they hire a pet sitter to come in twice a day and pet them and things like that and their cats you know their so use to the attention that if they don't get it they get really upset
sw2641B-ms98-a-0050 231.848000 236.077750 and you know they sort of cause trouble around the house and things like that

sw2641B-ms98-a-0059 268.389375 270.391875 gosh what do you call it fish tank
sw2641B-ms98-a-0060 270.391875 284.951500 and [laughter-fried] itself [laughter] on the radiator behind the dresser i'll never forget that because i remember my brother he came home and he counted the fish and one of the fish was missing and they couldn't find it anyplace they couldn't figure out what had happened and then they found it fried on [laughter-the] [laughter-radiator] [laughter-behind]
sw2641B-ms98-a-0061 284.951500 293.705625 [vocalized-noise] well it was not gross i didn't see it but um [vocalized-noise] he got them trying to remember we had a dog for a while 
sw2641B-ms98-a-0062 293.705625 307.626125 and i don't know if we got rid of the dog because_1 my brother was allergic to it my brother had asthma and some allergies which i think he's outgrown now but because of that we didn't have very many pets afterwards and then he had fish
sw2641B-ms98-a-0063 307.626125 312.717250 and you they're like you say they're not the most exciting pet to have
sw2641B-ms98-a-0064 312.717250 322.185750 [silence]
sw2641B-ms98-a-0065 322.185750 325.394000 well a friend of mine had um an eel
sw2641B-ms98-a-0066 325.394000 338.011000 and then he had a um i forget what type of fish it was it was one of these fish that i- it would eat it ate a big other fish and things like that there would be sort of moby fish in a tank
sw2641B-ms98-a-0067 338.011000 341.260875 yeah and it
sw2641B-ms98-a-0068 341.260875 349.542250 i i couldn't see having fish like that i could see sort of having maybe some of the tropical fish that are really really pretty but

sw2641B-ms98-a-0074 361.664250 370.568250 yeah no that would be what did they do everyone come around and watch them i mean i guess that's fine if you have a mouse problem at your frat house and you just destroyed the mice
sw2641B-ms98-a-0075 370.568250 371.935875 but
sw2641B-ms98-a-0076 371.935875 376.081875 let's see i had a pet rat [laughter] for a while
sw2641B-ms98-a-0077 376.081875 378.747750 and it was a live rat and
sw2641B-ms98-a-0078 378.747750 386.736875 um this woman just offered it to me while i was in in graduate school and she was actually a very fun pet

sw2641B-ms98-a-0083 399.793125 412.269750 how did this work a male rat had been bought and the people in the lab one day called in my friend and said you know this rat is acting really strange i think he's sick and she said i don't think he's sick i think she's [laughter-pregnant]
sw2641B-ms98-a-0084 412.269750 425.415875 and they had misclass[ified]- the sex of the [laughter-the] [laughter-uh] rat there and so um she asked me if i want to one of those babies and i took the baby and i got her when she was you know just this tiniest little thing like half the size of a mouse
sw2641B-ms98-a-0085 425.415875 437.317250 and then she grew to be you know i had pictures of her when she would sit on my hand and then she grew to be pretty big you know like a pound or something i don't know how much and i had her for over two years and she was very affectionate she would you know
sw2641B-ms98-a-0086 437.317250 443.575875 crawl on me and she would sit like on my neck or my shoulder while i was working and things like that yeah much more than you would think

sw2641B-ms98-a-0099 482.491125 489.202000 it's not fair to a pet to have a pet here or certainly certainly not a dog i mean people do
