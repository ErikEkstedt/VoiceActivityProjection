sw2689B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.703875 [noise]
sw2689B-ms98-a-0002 0.703875 2.107250 okay_1
sw2689B-ms98-a-0003 2.107250 14.746875 what can we do about crime i don't know the one thing that keeps coming to mind to me is that they're they don't have enough space in the prisons to put people and they keep letting out people that have you know these horrible records
sw2689B-ms98-a-0004 14.746875 16.985250 so maybe we need to have more
sw2689B-ms98-a-0005 16.985250 24.173250 prisons or use the old army bases and make them_1 into prisons or something that's one thing i guess i could think of
sw2689B-ms98-a-0006 24.173250 39.163875 uh it's definitely a big concern i mean every day it's you know all are e[ven]- we live in a little small town and there's just rapes and murders and burglaries and everything all the time and you just can't get away from it no matter where you live
sw2689B-ms98-a-0007 39.163875 41.400000 so it's pretty scary
sw2689B-ms98-a-0008 41.400000 44.704000 [silence]
sw2689B-ms98-a-0009 44.704000 46.459750 um-hum
sw2689B-ms98-a-0010 46.459750 49.292250 [silence]
sw2689B-ms98-a-0011 49.292250 50.488125 yeah
sw2689B-ms98-a-0012 50.488125 54.812875 [silence]
sw2689B-ms98-a-0013 54.812875 57.318250 yeah it's rough because_1
sw2689B-ms98-a-0014 57.318250 65.117750 [silence]
sw2689B-ms98-a-0015 65.117750 66.619375 yeah
sw2689B-ms98-a-0016 66.619375 76.880375 yeah well even some of the sentences just seem ridiculous i mean you hear about people you know six and seven times have committed burglaries and they're still you know only serving six months in prison
sw2689B-ms98-a-0017 76.880375 86.041375 so that's definitely something they could have a more automatic sentence instead of having the judge having the choice of like you know from one month to ten years or something
sw2689B-ms98-a-0018 86.041375 96.353000 that would be one thing that you know i think could help is having the laws be changed so that they were more stiff penalties and more automatic penalties you know for certain crimes
sw2689B-ms98-a-0019 96.353000 98.016500 yeah
sw2689B-ms98-a-0020 98.016500 102.805375 [silence]
sw2689B-ms98-a-0021 102.805375 108.807875 yeah and one things that they're saying now are you going are you a student or are you in the work force or
sw2689B-ms98-a-0022 108.807875 110.678875 [silence]
sw2689B-ms98-a-0023 110.678875 119.735250 oh okay because one of the things that i've heard so much about l[ately]- um lately is the situations on campus where crime has gone up so much and apparently many of the
sw2689B-ms98-a-0024 119.735250 129.688625 especially like in date rape many of the um you know perpetrators seem to be getting off because the universities kind of cover up and they don't really
sw2689B-ms98-a-0025 129.688625 130.838875 [silence]
sw2689B-ms98-a-0026 130.838875 133.681625 oh yeah
sw2689B-ms98-a-0027 133.681625 135.658000 yeah yeah
sw2689B-ms98-a-0028 135.658000 141.183125 [silence]
sw2689B-ms98-a-0029 141.183125 142.265750 yeah
sw2689B-ms98-a-0030 142.265750 144.637125 [silence]
sw2689B-ms98-a-0031 144.637125 148.153875 yeah they say like only one in ten are reported i believe it
sw2689B-ms98-a-0032 148.153875 160.548125 that's it's awful so one thing they could do is probably support people more reporting it i know some police agencies try to have women police officers that the women can report to and this kind of thing but
sw2689B-ms98-a-0033 160.548125 167.362500 i'm sure it's still terribly traumatizing you know for people to report it so that's probably something else they could do
sw2689B-ms98-a-0034 167.362500 180.891375 i don't know it seems like something else in terms of crime is certainly involved with drugs you know and that's like as long as i[t]- it almost makes me feel in a way like making drugs legalized just to get all the money out of it and not have you know because_1 these kids are saying why should i go
sw2689B-ms98-a-0035 180.891375 189.006625 to high school and so i can go out and work at Burger King you know for four dollars an hour or whatever when i can make uh four hundred dollars a day selling drugs
sw2689B-ms98-a-0036 189.006625 197.204000 so that's certainly a big problem i don't know what the solution to that is having more drug treatment centers available jeez i don't know
sw2689B-ms98-a-0037 197.204000 203.498000 [silence]
sw2689B-ms98-a-0038 203.498000 205.079250 yeah
sw2689B-ms98-a-0039 205.079250 214.196625 [silence]
sw2689B-ms98-a-0040 214.196625 221.894250 yeah because it ends up even if it's just kind of like this social drug use you're still ending up supporting these big drug pin you know
sw2689B-ms98-a-0041 221.894250 229.500000 huge amounts thousand and millions and millions of dollars are getting spent you know on higher and higher up on drugs and it's definitely
sw2689B-ms98-a-0042 229.500000 243.364625 got to do with crime you know you hear about people selling their babies you know to get some crack i mean just oh gosh horrible stuff like that one of the things they're doing is is they're prosecuting the women who are having these kids that are addicted to crack
sw2689B-ms98-a-0043 243.364625 253.213250 they said um some of the statis[tics]- statistics show like one out of every ten babies being born in these public hospitals are addicted to crack and their moms are crack users
sw2689B-ms98-a-0044 253.213250 259.924125 so that's you know another way of looking at it as as the woman is being a criminal you know for doing that to her child
sw2689B-ms98-a-0045 259.924125 267.038625 so i don't know who's the victim there i mean the kids are the victim it seems like a lot of times the women are victims because_1 they're addicted and [noise]
sw2689B-ms98-a-0046 267.038625 273.460125 it's a very complicated problem i don't envy the government trying to cope with it gosh
sw2689B-ms98-a-0047 273.460125 275.019625 yeah
sw2689B-ms98-a-0048 275.019625 279.332250 well i guess that's about all i have to say is there anything else you would want to
sw2689B-ms98-a-0049 279.332250 281.064250 okay
sw2689B-ms98-a-0050 281.064250 286.336875 [silence]
sw2689B-ms98-a-0051 286.336875 288.160125 yeah
sw2689B-ms98-a-0052 288.160125 292.291250 yeah yeah it's frustrating
sw2689B-ms98-a-0053 292.291250 293.397000 [silence]
sw2689B-ms98-a-0054 293.397000 297.253500 okay well thanks for talking have a good day bye bye
sw2689B-ms98-a-0055 297.253500 299.853625 [noise]
