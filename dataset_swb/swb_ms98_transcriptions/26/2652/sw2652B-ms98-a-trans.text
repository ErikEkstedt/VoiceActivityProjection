sw2652B-ms98-a-0007 23.742875 36.056500 but occasionally i [laughter-have] [laughter-to] [laughter-get] [laughter-dressed] up and wear panty hose and a dress and high heel shoes and i feel really uncomfortable doing that and in the plant so uh it's it's a problem for me 
sw2652B-ms98-a-0008 36.056500 42.429625 but normally i just wear blue jeans and a T-shirt very very comfortable i like that so much better than having to wear dress clothes

sw2652B-ms98-a-0018 82.366750 91.548125 but now that i you know work in the manufacturing plant then it's just it's so much more difficult for me to to actually get dressed up to come in to work like that
sw2652B-ms98-a-0019 91.548125 101.056625 um but occasionally i have to because uh part of my job is teaching and training and uh so you have to look just a little bit nicer than your normal [laughter-i] [laughter-know] 
sw2652B-ms98-a-0020 101.056625 105.834875 than your normal garb but i'm like you too uh i moved from Ohio down to here
sw2652B-ms98-a-0021 105.834875 118.413125 and i had mostly polyesters and wools and winter clothes and buying all these cotton clothes and then of course you have to iron them all the time that's really that's been a problem for me

sw2652B-ms98-a-0034 147.407750 153.844500 and because it's a wool skirt and there's just not that many opportunities to wear it and i have five or six wool skirts
sw2652B-ms98-a-0035 153.844500 157.201375 so i was thinking well maybe you know i need to think about getting rid of them but
sw2652B-ms98-a-0036 157.201375 160.498500 no i folded it up neatly and put it [laughter-away] maybe next year
