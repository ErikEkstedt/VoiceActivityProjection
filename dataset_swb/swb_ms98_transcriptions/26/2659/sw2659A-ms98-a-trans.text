sw2659A-ms98-a-0010 25.284500 34.805500 um okay uh my favorite i have a lot of favorites i like to try a lot of different things uh
sw2659A-ms98-a-0011 34.805500 48.511500 there's very few foods that i don't like i don't like asparagus and beets and anything else i can pretty much eat uh recently i went to a French restaurant and i had something called uh spinach fettucini and crawfish
sw2659A-ms98-a-0012 48.511500 62.786125 and it was so delicious i've been talking about it it's my birthday and i've been talking about it [laughter-ever] [laughter-since] it's been about a week now i've been talking about this plate of food and uh the real important part of it for me in a restaurant is the service
sw2659A-ms98-a-0013 62.786125 73.328000 uh in this particular French restaurant was our problem to be going back again and again uh they there were three waiters that waited on the entire restaurant they just all kept an eye on all the tables
sw2659A-ms98-a-0014 73.328000 77.544375 and something that really impressed me was that i asked one waiter for butter
sw2659A-ms98-a-0015 77.544375 89.720375 and then the next second anoth[er]- a [vocalized-noise] different waiter brought the butter out as and and they hadn't even talked or anything and it was it was really [laughter-amazing] [laughter] and so that really impresses me the service in a restaurant
sw2659A-ms98-a-0016 89.720375 97.911500 [silence]

sw2659A-ms98-a-0026 132.903000 134.085500 [silence]
sw2659A-ms98-a-0027 134.085500 146.097250 i find that most most family owned restaurant or or single restaurant you get the best service simply because that restaurant belongs to somebody it it it has the family name on it
sw2659A-ms98-a-0028 146.097250 158.970250 and so whoever's in there is going to take care of you as opposed to going into a chain restaurant where they're just hiring you know people out of that really don't probably don't care too much about the establishment so they're not going to worry about taking care of you
sw2659A-ms98-a-0029 158.970250 171.256500 whereas someone that actually is there that owns it that you know has been working there for twenty years or so they want they want you to be happy so you get the service and you know of course with that will come the good food

sw2659A-ms98-a-0040 193.104000 204.671000 exactly the guy that took me out to this French restaurant he works in a hotel nearby and he just happened to mention to the waiter that he sends a lot of the people from the hotel over to the guy's restaurant
sw2659A-ms98-a-0041 204.671000 213.281500 and and at the end of our meal you know we're ready to go and we're full and this guy sends us a platter of each dessert
sw2659A-ms98-a-0042 213.281500 224.714750 that the restaurant has so it was like ten desserts on one plate and he just [laughter-gave] [laughter-it] [laughter-to] [laughter-us] [laughter-to] [laughter-eat] of course we couldn't eat it but you know he just did this and so the next time when we come in he'll probably remember us
sw2659A-ms98-a-0043 224.714750 230.661250 just because we looked so weird at the [laughter-dessert] [vocalized-noise] you know but that that was
