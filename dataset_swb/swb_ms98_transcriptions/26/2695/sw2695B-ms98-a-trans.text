sw2695B-ms98-a-0011 46.496875 54.736000 uh there was a bunch of people that were uh they first of all they they [vocalized-noise] thought they had Parkin[son]- Parkinson's disease 
sw2695B-ms98-a-0012 54.736000 61.806375 they would tr[emble]- first start trembling real bad but then they would just g[o]- almost go into a coma
sw2695B-ms98-a-0013 61.806375 63.702000 and uh
sw2695B-ms98-a-0014 63.702000 68.998500 they they could tell that they were res[ponding]- that they could hear you
sw2695B-ms98-a-0015 68.998500 74.247625 but it was just a blank stare you got and they were just almost frozen

sw2695B-ms98-a-0136 501.615375 502.996250 [laughter]
sw2695B-ms98-a-0137 502.996250 511.518500 but uh i remember when i was a kid kid and you'd go to the movies and you got to see a movie and usually a double feature
sw2695B-ms98-a-0138 511.518500 514.968625 you got to see a newsreel
sw2695B-ms98-a-0139 514.968625 515.993000 [silence]
sw2695B-ms98-a-0140 515.993000 524.989125 and usually a serial like Flash Gordon or or uh Zorro or something like that line
sw2695B-ms98-a-0141 524.989125 526.995250 and then a cartoon
sw2695B-ms98-a-0142 526.995250 528.002250 [silence]
sw2695B-ms98-a-0143 528.002250 531.280625 at least one cartoon sometimes two cartoons
