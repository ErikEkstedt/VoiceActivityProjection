sw2679A-ms98-a-0019 90.866750 94.439750 uh where i guess i'm thinking of the easy thing to do
sw2679A-ms98-a-0020 94.439750 97.073250 for for having uh
sw2679A-ms98-a-0021 97.073250 98.559125 uh a dinner
sw2679A-ms98-a-0022 98.559125 107.077250 i do cook but not i'm mostly the easy cooker you know the breakfasts and and the steaks uh although i would like to experiment with uh
sw2679A-ms98-a-0023 107.077250 113.361500 the meals my mother made you know so to speak and i haven't gotten around to that yet uh

sw2679A-ms98-a-0026 118.115000 127.416500 she would make very economical [vocalized-noise] meals we were very poor different rice and ham and things that uh she would throw things together
sw2679A-ms98-a-0027 127.416500 133.600500 and {galunkies} and all that and uh i would like to try that one day and she would make
sw2679A-ms98-a-0028 133.600500 141.693250 spaghetti with pork chops and and special meat balls and everything and my wife of course thinks i'm crazy which i may be too but uh [laughter]

sw2679A-ms98-a-0039 165.267500 172.318375 just because it only takes a few minutes to cook you know you get it ready you have to do a lot of work beforehand i agree and buy special stuff but uh
sw2679A-ms98-a-0040 172.318375 181.892875 so far as getting out there and and putting it on it only takes a litt[le]- a few minutes uh but anyway i'm i'm thinking of the easy way rather than my guests i guess but uh

sw2679A-ms98-a-0057 251.433125 260.657875 the recipes are really interesting you know we're probably going to lose them we'll probably forget all about them you know since we're trying to make everything so sim[ple]- here i am talk about trying to make everything easy you know
sw2679A-ms98-a-0058 260.657875 273.990125 i uh you talked about Thanksgiving there are interesting meals at different times uh something s[ee]- my wife's from Texas so uh remember we were first married and we were living in New Jersey and uh we were going over to my mother's house for

sw2679A-ms98-a-0060 288.828750 299.480875 i said yeah i said no turkey is only for Thanksgiving and because she had turkey a lot you know and uh that was surprising in the in the east uh we always had ham you know
sw2679A-ms98-a-0061 299.480875 303.597125 a[nd]- and and that's one thing als[o]- that's another recipe i guess we could talk about
sw2679A-ms98-a-0062 303.597125 315.346375 now the hams just kind of you know go take it out of a can or or uh a package sliced uh the cans were cooked for hours and hours and and were just wonderful you know i i'd like to try that too

sw2679A-ms98-a-0089 425.437375 435.982750 we've never done that you know and i remember that when i was a kid uh to have the ham cooking uh rather than that we just ham is just something you have for breakfast occasionally you know and that's it you know
sw2679A-ms98-a-0090 435.982750 440.765625 in the old days we had hams were the meal and i don't i don't think we really have it as a main meal

sw2679A-ms98-a-0105 501.527000 509.353000 i uh my my wife's mother is the only grandparent left and uh she has high cholesterol of course i ha[ve]- i have too but not like hers
sw2679A-ms98-a-0106 509.353000 519.718000 and i always get after her about salt and everything else and she just will i mean she's going to eat the same way she ate you know her whole life and she just tells more or less tells me to shut up you know
sw2679A-ms98-a-0107 519.718000 524.884125 and uh i like to tr[y]- i'm trying to do something about my cholesterol in the same way uh 
sw2679A-ms98-a-0108 524.884125 534.423125 uh it's it's not the [vocalized-noise] i listen to uh Larry Newarth on the weekend he's a fitness expert and uh he talks about you know the chicken and the rice and everything else and
sw2679A-ms98-a-0109 534.423125 546.200000 and uh throwing away peanut butter and all the [laughter-things] [laughter-things] [laughter-not] [laughter-to] [laughter-eat] [laughter-you] [laughter-know] ever i think the peanut butter and mayonnaise he would throw away forever and then he's got me into making eggs without the yolk
sw2679A-ms98-a-0110 546.200000 553.231625 you know try that sometime [vocalized-noise] my wife says she can't stand it but uh when i make scrambled eggs now talking about a recipe 
sw2679A-ms98-a-0111 553.231625 560.115375 i say if i have four eggs not not for me but if i'm making four eggs uh even for my daughter and i i'll take out all the yolks but one
sw2679A-ms98-a-0112 560.115375 565.150000 and it's fine you you don't miss it uh in fact when i when i make eggs for myself
sw2679A-ms98-a-0113 565.150000 568.244750 if i if i fry them throw them in there i will
sw2679A-ms98-a-0114 568.244750 570.200125 almost hard fry them
sw2679A-ms98-a-0115 570.200125 572.985000 so i can take not eat the yolk at all
sw2679A-ms98-a-0116 572.985000 576.691375 and you don't really miss it you get the flavor of the yolk
sw2679A-ms98-a-0117 576.691375 582.670000 but uh you don't eat it at all you know you don't or hardly you get like uh a bite at at th[e]- the most
sw2679A-ms98-a-0118 582.670000 588.789125 and so uh for cholesterol i mean i'm trying that and it has worked my cholesterol gone down twenty points uh although
sw2679A-ms98-a-0119 588.789125 599.943375 i haven't gotten on the which whether was it butter or cholest[erol]- not cholesterol margarine and all that i don't know know whether any of that is true you know whether the margarines are butter
