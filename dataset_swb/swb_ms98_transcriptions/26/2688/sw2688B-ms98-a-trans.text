sw2688B-ms98-a-0049 269.360000 270.780000 [silence]
sw2688B-ms98-a-0050 270.780000 275.542000 she admits it she's tired of it so she works down here she's a nurse she's qualified
sw2688B-ms98-a-0051 275.542000 287.580000 but she's fifty oh she's in her fif[ties]- early fifties somewhere and working down here at the nursing home keeps her hand in there she gets good money for it and she enjoys the old people
