sw2688A-ms98-a-0033 149.323875 161.728750 that's true that's that's what i would be afraid of i would rather personally i would rather be in a community of other people with
sw2688A-ms98-a-0034 161.728750 165.021625 a greater chance of having similar interest with them
sw2688A-ms98-a-0035 165.021625 176.920500 rather than being stuck in a home where i mean if you if you couldn't drive i guess i mean if you're no longer have the the freedom of driving
sw2688A-ms98-a-0036 176.920500 189.652375 then it [vocalized-noise] it changes it so drastically because you can't go someplace to do something when you want to you ha[ve]- you are totally dependent on someone else to provide all your entertainment for you and that would 
sw2688A-ms98-a-0037 189.652375 192.943000 i don't think i would like that i think i would rather
sw2688A-ms98-a-0038 192.943000 198.667625 if i were in that situation i think i would rather live in a in a nursing home situation

sw2688A-ms98-a-0073 326.252500 338.268375 uh-huh my great grandmother was and she was she was terrified that some day someone might try to put her in a nursing home she even wrote a song about it she used to sing [noise] but 
sw2688A-ms98-a-0074 338.268375 344.724750 i mean she she died when she was ninety six and uh
sw2688A-ms98-a-0075 344.724750 354.790750 from a fall [laughter-i] [laughter-mean] [laughter-she] didn't even [laughter-die] of natural causes she died from a fall she uh you know had she been younger it would not she would not have died from the fall but 
sw2688A-ms98-a-0076 354.790750 360.220875 she uh you know and she was still [noise]
sw2688A-ms98-a-0077 360.220875 372.730625 she was still [vocalized-noise] household independent she was independent in the household you know in the home and she couldn't drive but heck but she'd never learned to drive to begin with so i mean it wasn't um
sw2688A-ms98-a-0078 372.730625 386.878875 her age that had prevented her but she was she was very afraid that someone would try to put her in a nursing home and she lived with her daughter my grandmother until she died and uh my grandmother still at seventy
sw2688A-ms98-a-0079 386.878875 393.187250 uh she's seventy nine this year uh is living independently
sw2688A-ms98-a-0080 393.187250 405.513750 and she drives [laughter] just to church and back [laughter-and] [laughter-to] and to the store you know all there right in just a block or two but she's still real independent so
sw2688A-ms98-a-0081 405.513750 418.773375 i think that for so many people that uh the nursing home represent obviously different uh different things and depending on the level of function
sw2688A-ms98-a-0082 418.773375 431.959125 whereas my you know my grandmother doesn't n[eed]- need any extra uh camaraderie or anything like that because she gets it from her church or from her friends that come by but uh
sw2688A-ms98-a-0083 431.959125 442.567375 i've seen a lot of people that don't live near their family or don't have you know significant roots in this in their little community they've been uprooted for some reason or another
sw2688A-ms98-a-0084 442.567375 450.110250 and they i i think that it would be good for them to be into a situation that
sw2688A-ms98-a-0085 450.110250 456.188000 would offer them uh oh activities to maintain an active mind
sw2688A-ms98-a-0086 456.188000 464.580625 because like you say if you just put them in the house and keep them there all day long and they they become they vegetate [noise] and that's

sw2688A-ms98-a-0101 542.979125 557.212875 oh no i mean look at the uh Orientals [laughter] they protect respect uh they conserve their elderly
sw2688A-ms98-a-0102 557.212875 570.150125 for for what they are they're a true natural resource and they cherish them and uh yet i mean we as Americans are such a throw away society
sw2688A-ms98-a-0103 570.150125 579.643750 that we've basically done that with generations of people that have so called outlived their usefulness
sw2688A-ms98-a-0104 579.643750 592.984000 you know i- i think that's uh an atrocity and i'm fortunate enough that i've had uh my relatives have lived very long full lives and uh
sw2688A-ms98-a-0105 592.984000 599.349750 or most of them have and as a result i have uh i've been you know [vocalized-noise]
