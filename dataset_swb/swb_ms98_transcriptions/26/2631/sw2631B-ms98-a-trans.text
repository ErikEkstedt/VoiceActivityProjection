sw2631B-ms98-a-0003 2.834000 13.584625 i have two children and they're older now but um i found it very difficult to find good child care when i was looking for a place to for stay while i taught school
sw2631B-ms98-a-0004 13.584625 15.046000 and um
sw2631B-ms98-a-0005 15.046000 29.176125 i wanted when they were very young when they were babies say till they were about two years old i preferred that they had an individual take care of them in a home and that's what i looked for and i was lucky enough to find one right across from my school and that worked
sw2631B-ms98-a-0006 29.176125 43.996375 yeah that worked out real well but when they got older i wanted them to be in a school type situation three i think they were both three when they started where they could learn to interact with kids and and be around kids their own age because i think that's
sw2631B-ms98-a-0007 43.996375 51.652500 that that would prepare them for school also it's real important that they do that um that they get that preparation for school
sw2631B-ms98-a-0008 51.652500 64.812375 so but i had i have switched schools several times because i di[d]- i really didn't care for what was going on at that the school i wanted them to learn to play i didn't academics forced on them at an early age

sw2631B-ms98-a-0045 255.894500 269.914000 because i'm a single parent and i uh you know my husband and i ex-husband and i got a divorce um when the children were small and so i uh was a teacher i uh still am teacher and it was really difficult to find affordable child care that was that was
sw2631B-ms98-a-0046 269.914000 277.710500 that was what i wanted where i could have piece of mind and when i taught school and i knew my kids were being taken care of yeah and plus i
sw2631B-ms98-a-0047 277.710500 284.346375 i uh wanted them to get something out of it i just didn't want it to be a day where they went and slept and ate cookies and
sw2631B-ms98-a-0048 284.346375 285.837875 that's it
sw2631B-ms98-a-0049 285.837875 296.301625 [silence]
sw2631B-ms98-a-0050 296.301625 297.697750 right
sw2631B-ms98-a-0051 297.697750 317.387125 [silence]
sw2631B-ms98-a-0052 317.387125 320.045125 i agree with that
sw2631B-ms98-a-0053 320.045125 333.841625 well the thing is i teach fifth grade and i i can see very readily the kids that didn't never learn socially how to get along with other children and they're the ones that are having problems not only getting along with the other kids but academically because
sw2631B-ms98-a-0054 333.841625 342.572125 they were not they're should be there's to many things in their way and so i want my i wanted my children and they did learn to get to get along with other people
sw2631B-ms98-a-0055 342.572125 344.372375 [silence]
sw2631B-ms98-a-0056 344.372375 351.111750 yeah and i mean i feel a lot of maladjusted adults and i bet if we trace back to their early childhood we could see some
sw2631B-ms98-a-0057 351.111750 356.532375 you know times they didn't get to play or be with other kids their own age really learn how do get along with people
sw2631B-ms98-a-0058 356.532375 370.345375 [silence]
sw2631B-ms98-a-0059 370.345375 372.006000 uh-huh

sw2631B-ms98-a-0061 387.236750 396.681125 i bet you could too because it you know kids have to learn how to get along with other people and if they don't they just don't turn out to be really you know good adults or
sw2631B-ms98-a-0062 396.681125 399.417875 successful adults i should say you know really
sw2631B-ms98-a-0063 399.417875 406.922625 but uh it is a big problem and you know i have lot of friends right now that uh have young children and they
sw2631B-ms98-a-0064 406.922625 413.299125 daily have problems with with whoever is taking care of the child or they switch a lot which is not good for the child either
sw2631B-ms98-a-0065 413.299125 414.659750 [silence]
sw2631B-ms98-a-0066 414.659750 428.884875 so you need because_1 you need that consistency when they're young like that and it would be ideal like you you hope when you have children your wife gets to stay home i would have have given anything if i would have been able to stay home with my children yeah you are
