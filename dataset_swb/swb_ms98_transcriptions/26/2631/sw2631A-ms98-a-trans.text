sw2631A-ms98-a-0013 64.238375 69.940875 yeah i um that that's oh oh you mean you switched schools for the kids uh-huh
sw2631A-ms98-a-0014 69.940875 78.138875 we[ll]- well i'm just recently married so i don't have any children though we plan on having them soon but i think um
sw2631A-ms98-a-0015 78.138875 84.728500 i think um that i that that's probably one of the biggest difficulties uh i think um i'm lucky though that um
sw2631A-ms98-a-0016 84.728500 98.491875 my wife will probably not have to work while our children are under four or five yeah be[cause]- be[cause]- i'm a college professor so and that's also and it's nice for me because um [noise]
sw2631A-ms98-a-0017 98.491875 113.454750 most of the time you have so much flexible hours so that i could probably work two or three days a week and then one or two evenings so that if my wife does um does go back to work part time um [noise]
sw2631A-ms98-a-0018 113.454750 120.004375 there probably will be a possibility that i could stay home two days that she would go to work and that i would have to teach at night
sw2631A-ms98-a-0019 120.004375 127.758125 yeah so it will probably workout real nice for us uh i think we're very lucky because just my job sort of builds in flexible schedules
sw2631A-ms98-a-0020 127.758125 139.451375 i can even teach on Saturdays and and things like that [noise] yeah um i do know that my brother and his wife have a terrible time finding uh child care and one of the things they made in um uh real
sw2631A-ms98-a-0021 139.451375 147.867875 they're number one priority was that um they're children didn't have to leave their home so they um um my sister-in-law is a uh
sw2631A-ms98-a-0022 147.867875 156.811125 um a clinical speech pathologist so she is als[o]- i guess her most recent position after she returned back to work
sw2631A-ms98-a-0023 156.811125 166.655125 she applied for a director's position an[d]- and got it so i guess she's very well qualified for her field i guess and even though she took off two years for um
sw2631A-ms98-a-0024 166.655125 175.360125 i guess four years all together it would be three years how old's Kayla three yeah i guess she took off three years all together um
sw2631A-ms98-a-0025 175.360125 185.935000 for because_1 i guess they have a four year old and yeah and my nephew's two almost two so i guess she took off three all together and then when she decided to go back to work um
sw2631A-ms98-a-0026 185.935000 191.082625 she was able to find good position and pay for somebody to come into their home
sw2631A-ms98-a-0027 191.082625 200.874875 yeah i think they were really lucky there but i think they've lost this woman she wi[ll]- she will not continue and and she won't do it in the summer because her kids are home from school
sw2631A-ms98-a-0028 200.874875 203.260625 so i don't know what they are going to do
sw2631A-ms98-a-0029 203.260625 204.835000 [silence]
sw2631A-ms98-a-0030 204.835000 206.432500 um-hum
sw2631A-ms98-a-0031 206.432500 213.925500 yeah i think i think they they're both they were both professionals unlike me they're um they'll my they were married
sw2631A-ms98-a-0032 213.925500 226.824625 my brother's five years younger then she is so she was probably twenty seven when they were married so she already had had gotten bachelors and masters and established herself in a profess[ion]- in a practice almost um
sw2631A-ms98-a-0033 226.824625 238.477125 um where you know he then they waited a couple years and and he got himself pretty far along i guess they didn't have kids until he was about twenty sev[en]- twenty six so by that time she was so well
sw2631A-ms98-a-0034 238.477125 247.021250 established you know i guess it made it a lot easier but uh i think the longer you wait the easier the easier it is if you have that
sw2631A-ms98-a-0035 247.021250 250.854500 that professional occupation where you can change
sw2631A-ms98-a-0036 250.854500 252.610125 yeah
sw2631A-ms98-a-0037 252.610125 257.114625 n[o]- yeah that's right that's true yeah

sw2631A-ms98-a-0049 287.140000 288.390750 i i guess
sw2631A-ms98-a-0050 288.390750 299.095250 it's so funny now with schools you know they don't take kid into kindergarten and when i guess when they're five and sometimes they flunk kindergarten now and they don't let them into kindergarten unless they can
sw2631A-ms98-a-0051 299.095250 303.892000 count to ten and they know their ABCs and i think that's so funny because um
sw2631A-ms98-a-0052 303.892000 316.950875 i don't i don't know if i want school's very important i'm an educator myself and my wife teaches and i it's a very important part of your life and i hope to read with my kids but i don't know if i want my kids to go to school at four
sw2631A-ms98-a-0053 316.950875 321.033375 or three you know i can see tha[t]- that when you make that point
sw2631A-ms98-a-0054 321.033375 322.302250 yeah

sw2631A-ms98-a-0063 341.758000 344.924875 uh-huh that's a really important point

sw2631A-ms98-a-0068 355.614875 364.970250 i think that's really that's important i i've seen the same thing i i think you're exactly right because you know i've gone ou[t]- or before i was married i went out with a girl and you [laughter-know] um
sw2631A-ms98-a-0069 364.970250 379.158875 boy after you know after about two months i realize this girl really has some deep set emotional problems and i bet and they could be traced back to just not being uh you know being moved between
sw2631A-ms98-a-0070 379.158875 388.718250 day care centers when she was one and two and three years old and never always being a bit snippy and spiteful i bet you could trace all the way back [laughter]

sw2631A-ms98-a-0083 425.307875 433.810750 yeah i i think i'm i'm very lucky um because of having you know flexible higher education provides a flexible schedule
sw2631A-ms98-a-0084 433.810750 446.735000 especiall[y]- i teach a computer classes so it's it's one of things where i'm paid a little bit better then a History or an English professor and i'm also um you know they have vocational type courses on weekends
sw2631A-ms98-a-0085 446.735000 458.390125 almost everywhere and you know you can take you can teach two three hours classes on a Saturday which means that you know whole week's worth of courses so that lets you be available three days during the week
sw2631A-ms98-a-0086 458.390125 471.508625 you know so you be will home with your kids i you know it's really funny is that i [laughter] i picked this career when i was in college because uh i think with my commitment to family and um wanting to spend more time with my children
sw2631A-ms98-a-0087 471.508625 482.235375 you know because my dad had very um nine to five type job with uh forty five minute commute into the city and a forty five commute home so by the time he got home he was so tired and
sw2631A-ms98-a-0088 482.235375 493.750375 he was all rung out from the day and i think he he missed a lot of um our up bringing you know my mother i i came from a family tha[t]- that my mother stayed home until we started school um
sw2631A-ms98-a-0089 493.750375 500.815375 um and i i don't uh it's funny i don't think she had to work until we started school i think teenagers become much more expensive [laughter]
sw2631A-ms98-a-0090 500.815375 502.406250 for it
sw2631A-ms98-a-0091 502.406250 504.745000 it's probably costing you a fortune
sw2631A-ms98-a-0092 504.745000 506.185875 [laughter]
sw2631A-ms98-a-0093 506.185875 512.276750 my goodness if if you want them to be able to drive the car the insurance bill th[e]- um

sw2631A-ms98-a-0105 554.265500 558.556875 it [laughter] it lasts a long time
