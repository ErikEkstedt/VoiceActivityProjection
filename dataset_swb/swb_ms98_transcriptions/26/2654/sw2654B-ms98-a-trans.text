sw2654B-ms98-a-0003 6.726875 12.248875 right um right my i'm from originally from Palestine over in east Texas
sw2654B-ms98-a-0004 12.248875 14.415750 [silence]
sw2654B-ms98-a-0005 14.415750 25.303750 yeah and uh the crime in in you know in east Texas is uh i- i think it's just about as bad the burglaries and uh the drugs and stuff seem to have moved out into that area 
sw2654B-ms98-a-0006 25.303750 27.145125 uh
sw2654B-ms98-a-0007 27.145125 29.202375 [silence]

sw2654B-ms98-a-0012 35.012375 36.204625 yeah
sw2654B-ms98-a-0013 36.204625 47.539500 right uh i guess uh it is really scary but the uh recognizing or i think recognizing that a lot of the crime in these smaller cities is really geared toward
sw2654B-ms98-a-0014 47.539500 60.956750 the the major cities anyway because i think that you know the people that are involved in the drug scene out in the rural areas are really out there to provide for the little you know the center cities
sw2654B-ms98-a-0015 60.956750 65.950875 but uh right but uh i guess the question is what do you do
sw2654B-ms98-a-0016 65.950875 78.884500 uh you know i think that uh from my own observation that that a lot of it probably stems around the school system i- i don't want to blame the school system on everything because it's
sw2654B-ms98-a-0017 78.884500 84.459875 it's not what they're doing it's not that they're doing so much wrong as that they can't not cannot do
sw2654B-ms98-a-0018 84.459875 94.517875 a lot of the things that need to be done uh right well even e[ven]- not just education but uh even discipline and and things like that
sw2654B-ms98-a-0019 94.517875 106.916000 that the schools are not allowed to do anymore that uh the students you know are just they have so much control over the schools themselves that that everything seems to turn around that
sw2654B-ms98-a-0020 106.916000 108.684125 um
sw2654B-ms98-a-0021 108.684125 111.063750 [silence]
sw2654B-ms98-a-0022 111.063750 112.482875 um-hum

sw2654B-ms98-a-0025 116.103250 119.454500 right yeah
sw2654B-ms98-a-0026 119.454500 121.420250 right 
sw2654B-ms98-a-0027 121.420250 133.214875 i do uh i travel a little bit in my in my job with i've got some clients in California and i was in California when the police out there beat you know beat up on that
sw2654B-ms98-a-0028 133.214875 147.968000 traffic deal yeah it's a real yeah really was and of and of course everybody's reaction to that was you know anger and disgust and shock and all of that but then when you turn around and look at at what's going on
sw2654B-ms98-a-0029 147.968000 157.180375 from the criminal element th[at]- th[at]- probably that does not even compare you know to what goes on {crimewise}
sw2654B-ms98-a-0030 157.180375 159.331750 and uh
sw2654B-ms98-a-0031 159.331750 168.182000 [silence]
sw2654B-ms98-a-0032 168.182000 169.423500 yeah

sw2654B-ms98-a-0034 175.812625 176.842625 yeah
sw2654B-ms98-a-0035 176.842625 182.986875 but uh you know i- i- i really don't i don't know what the answer is but i think that if we don't find an answer
sw2654B-ms98-a-0036 182.986875 187.875375 soon that it's we're really going to be in a lot worse trouble than we are now [vocalized-noise] 
sw2654B-ms98-a-0037 187.875375 202.233750 i think uh perhaps the Supreme Court has taken a couple of steps in the right direction recently uh i understand that they lightened up a little bit on some of the the restrictions on you know crime investigation and stuff so
sw2654B-ms98-a-0038 202.233750 205.271750 and you know yeah 
sw2654B-ms98-a-0039 205.271750 208.662750 [silence]
sw2654B-ms98-a-0040 208.662750 211.634625 right And say if you don't don't appeal
sw2654B-ms98-a-0041 211.634625 214.937750 to start with then you don't have the right to appeal
sw2654B-ms98-a-0042 214.937750 216.983125 and uh you know i think the
sw2654B-ms98-a-0043 216.983125 227.987000 [silence]
sw2654B-ms98-a-0044 227.987000 229.535625 uh-huh
sw2654B-ms98-a-0045 229.535625 231.461000 uh and it's
sw2654B-ms98-a-0046 231.461000 234.965000 that's uh that's a fact you you can
sw2654B-ms98-a-0047 234.965000 241.016125 look forward to a just a few days in jail sometime for you know for what would seem to be a major crime uh 
sw2654B-ms98-a-0048 241.016125 250.688125 with uh appeals and all that and getting time credit for spending time in jail and i think they even give credit sometimes for the the time they're out of jail between
sw2654B-ms98-a-0049 250.688125 256.373375 between uh the time they're indicted and the time they're tried and stuff like that that still counts toward their sentence
sw2654B-ms98-a-0050 256.373375 261.937875 [silence]
sw2654B-ms98-a-0051 261.937875 263.330875 yeah

sw2654B-ms98-a-0053 264.472375 267.474875 yeah That uh i guess uh
sw2654B-ms98-a-0054 267.474875 281.585000 the uh the number of of beds available in a jails uh you know [vocalized-noise] we've got to have it to increase because the number of criminals are increasing but we've got we really need to work on the other side you know to to 
sw2654B-ms98-a-0055 281.585000 286.656125 right but uh i don't know what
sw2654B-ms98-a-0056 286.656125 291.493625 [silence]
sw2654B-ms98-a-0057 291.493625 292.803375 yeah
sw2654B-ms98-a-0058 292.803375 305.392750 well i think uh uh you know back to uh back to uh the the school situation the parents are the ones that that that demand all the rights for these students for the children
sw2654B-ms98-a-0059 305.392750 312.864125 they they want to put so much restrictions on and and and you know then they don't take on the responsibility themselves
sw2654B-ms98-a-0060 312.864125 314.262250 and uh
sw2654B-ms98-a-0061 314.262250 317.303625 so it's it kind of perpetuates itself eh 
sw2654B-ms98-a-0062 317.303625 323.921375 [silence]
sw2654B-ms98-a-0063 323.921375 332.908625 yeah well i've i've got two that are they're still at home but they they think they're adults they're both out of you know out of high school one of them_1 go to college
sw2654B-ms98-a-0064 332.908625 339.378750 and uh i we really were nervous about our son uh the second one
sw2654B-ms98-a-0065 339.378750 344.295125 uh going to school and you know Richardson schools are some of the best around
sw2654B-ms98-a-0066 344.295125 351.758625 and even at that it's you know it was a real touchy situation as to what you know as to
sw2654B-ms98-a-0067 351.758625 355.402250 who the associates were there are students in every school system
sw2654B-ms98-a-0068 355.402250 359.154125 that uh you don't want your kids associating with if you can help it
sw2654B-ms98-a-0069 359.154125 360.188000 [silence]
sw2654B-ms98-a-0070 360.188000 364.651625 and uh you don't you know you don't have any control over it yourself
sw2654B-ms98-a-0071 364.651625 366.087250 yeah
sw2654B-ms98-a-0072 366.087250 367.794500 right
sw2654B-ms98-a-0073 367.794500 369.730375 so
sw2654B-ms98-a-0074 369.730375 380.082750 um-hum yeah it's uh we said you know that we'd have been a lot better off our children would have been a l[ot]- a lot better off being raised in a smaller smaller area
sw2654B-ms98-a-0075 380.082750 382.318375 smaller town smaller school
sw2654B-ms98-a-0076 382.318375 386.285875 or at least we thought perhaps at the time but you know
sw2654B-ms98-a-0077 386.285875 393.223500 not so sure anymore we did have some friends that moved uh out into well out in rural Collin County
sw2654B-ms98-a-0078 393.223500 400.115375 thinking that that would have been a you know a better place for their kids and before their kids got out of school the drug scene had moved in out there
sw2654B-ms98-a-0079 400.115375 404.993125 and you know so they you notice that it's not not a whole lot different there than it is 
sw2654B-ms98-a-0080 404.993125 407.165750 in you know in town
sw2654B-ms98-a-0081 407.165750 408.999750 yeah
sw2654B-ms98-a-0082 408.999750 410.543875 yeah
sw2654B-ms98-a-0083 410.543875 412.088000 so

sw2654B-ms98-a-0085 413.566625 416.458500 but well it's
sw2654B-ms98-a-0086 416.458500 418.980000 [silence]
sw2654B-ms98-a-0087 418.980000 429.143250 yeah i'm glad that they're not expecting us to come up with all the answers on these phone [laughter-conversations] right yeah yeah they you'd think that what
sw2654B-ms98-a-0088 429.143250 443.044875 well everybody's concerned but you know we give uh Congress and we give the state legislators the you know all these powers and authorities and everything and th[ey]- they spend a lot of time on it and they can't come up with the answers so right
sw2654B-ms98-a-0089 443.044875 446.319500 so but uh it's
sw2654B-ms98-a-0090 446.319500 449.533500 yeah maybe we maybe it's uh it's time for
sw2654B-ms98-a-0091 449.533500 454.204375 there to be more people involved i guess in in trying to find the answer but
sw2654B-ms98-a-0092 454.204375 456.965125 and since you know
sw2654B-ms98-a-0093 456.965125 460.024500 [silence]
