sw2627B-ms98-a-0042 152.493500 159.250625 no no i'm from New England so we we had um a lot of seafood before we moved down here
sw2627B-ms98-a-0043 159.250625 169.959000 and uh that sounds delicious [laughter-to] [laughter-me] that sounds great i think we're just thinking of having a uh dinner party we went to this dinner party the other night that
sw2627B-ms98-a-0044 169.959000 178.740000 was kind of like a game they had uh a murder mystery and you came dressed as one of the characters and you had to solve the mystery during the dinner
sw2627B-ms98-a-0045 178.740000 190.954000 and it was really fun and so we we were thinking we wanted to do you know we were going to try doing it ourselves but we're trying to decide what can we serve because at this one the hostess was pretty busy running around
sw2627B-ms98-a-0046 190.954000 196.018125 trying to get stuff ready for the table and that kind of interrupted the game so
sw2627B-ms98-a-0047 196.018125 205.374000 so i was thinking there's this beef bourguignonne recipe that i've tried before that's pretty good and then you can make that ahead and you can just leave it in the pot on a stove until you're ready
sw2627B-ms98-a-0048 205.374000 207.223750 so that's uh
sw2627B-ms98-a-0049 207.223750 209.046625 [silence]
sw2627B-ms98-a-0050 209.046625 210.309125 yeah

sw2627B-ms98-a-0065 251.247500 262.027500 yeah we didn't my family didn't but when i got into the vegetarian cooking we got kind of used to that but my husband always did it kind of grudgingly he never there was dishes that he really enjoyed
sw2627B-ms98-a-0066 262.027500 272.894625 eating there there were several things that he liked but it never was really something that he would have chosen it's just that i cooked so he had to [laughter-put] [laughter-up] [laughter-with] [laughter-it]
sw2627B-ms98-a-0067 272.894625 285.350625 so but there was one thing that he couldn't stand and that was soybeans i tried it like once or twice and he just could not eat it so i never i had i was limited i had to make vegetarian meals without using soybeans but
sw2627B-ms98-a-0068 285.350625 289.760375 yeah yeah that's true

sw2627B-ms98-a-0071 301.629250 316.214375 and we had little kids at the time you know when i was home with them and it it was just so much cooking i couldn't i don't like to cook and i'm not really that great at it so it just turned out to be too much of a too much [noise] too much cooking
sw2627B-ms98-a-0072 316.214375 323.505625 so well i guess i'll let you get back to feeding your little one there
sw2627B-ms98-a-0073 323.505625 326.946250 he's set oh okay okay

sw2627B-ms98-a-0083 368.790250 383.668125 um i don't do it anymore because_1 it's just too fattening we had the same kind of problem if you make homemade bread i mean for[get]- it's supposed to save you money but you eat like three times the amount of bread that you [laughter-usually] eat [laughter] it tastes so good 
sw2627B-ms98-a-0084 383.668125 386.678625 [silence]
sw2627B-ms98-a-0085 386.678625 391.231625 oh uh yeah
