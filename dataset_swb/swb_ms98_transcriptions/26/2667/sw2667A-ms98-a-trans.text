sw2667A-ms98-a-0020 62.701000 67.602500 it's always easy to find an excuse not to exercise i know what you mean [laughter]

sw2667A-ms98-a-0022 71.084625 84.537125 um well i try to um i started at the beginning of this year i decided all right i'm going to start exercising again i'm going to be real good and i went through the TI fitness center and registered for the uh aerobics classes there
sw2667A-ms98-a-0023 84.537125 94.835000 and they run for two months at a time and you have to you do have to pay to take them and i took i signed up for one that was three nights a week an hour and a half so that was four and a half hours a week
sw2667A-ms98-a-0024 94.835000 105.998750 and it cost sixty dollars and i thought okay that's not cheap that'll encourage me to always go since i spent that much money and i had a friend of mine going so i was real good i only missed it about three times
sw2667A-ms98-a-0025 105.998750 118.474500 and then oh March came around and i signed up again and i got uh caught up with a class i was taking at TI and then i was having to work some real late hours to get caught with my work after i got out of class and
sw2667A-ms98-a-0026 118.474500 128.178875 then i went to Colorado Springs the next week to do some training at the TI up there and so that was two weeks i had missed and boy i tell you what i've been terrible ever since then

sw2667A-ms98-a-0036 154.560750 165.542500 oh yeah i think i've been two maybe three times the month of April and this session is about to run out now i signed up for a different one now that's only two nights a week because i am getting kind of
sw2667A-ms98-a-0037 165.542500 176.408625 into a real a busy schedule as far as teaching a lot of training classes and some of them require me to go out of town and and uh that just kind of throws my whole schedule off when am doing that so
sw2667A-ms98-a-0038 176.408625 189.325375 and i've lately yeah there's been nights that i could have gone and i've found excuses uh [laughter] things like i- i had the flu last week but i'm fine this week i could have gone Monday i could have gone tonight and i didn't so i'm kind of
sw2667A-ms98-a-0039 189.325375 201.843375 kind of finding excuses and now it's kind of like well this is the last week i'll just start fresh next week but i better [laughter-do] better do it and i think another thing is that my friend that was taking with me the first two months
sw2667A-ms98-a-0040 201.843375 213.457125 wasn't the second two months she started taking tennis lessons and so i haven't had that extra motivation of of us forcing each other or not forcing each other but encouraging each other to go so

sw2667A-ms98-a-0058 268.391250 272.649375 [silence]
sw2667A-ms98-a-0059 272.649375 280.310375 right yeah walking is kind of boring i do have a few friends that live in my apartment complex in this neighborhood and we try to
sw2667A-ms98-a-0060 280.310375 289.024000 we used to try to get together and i think now that the weather's getting nicer we're going to start doing it again and occasionally go walking there's a real nice residential area right behind our apartment complex
sw2667A-ms98-a-0061 289.024000 292.865750 and it's not as boring if you get several people and you can kind of talk and
sw2667A-ms98-a-0062 292.865750 298.920125 and it it makes it pass pretty quickly and the aerobics isn't too boring i kind of enjoy it when i'm doing it
sw2667A-ms98-a-0063 298.920125 310.463875 um it's it's a lot more fun than some other things i could do i guess but uh i do i do have to make myself go and of course while i'm doing it i feel pretty good and after i get finished i feel great
sw2667A-ms98-a-0064 310.463875 322.908500 i mean i can go in there i can be like a Friday afternoon when i'm tired it's the end of the week and i just want to go home and i'll make myself go and i'll have headache and everything and i get out i don't have a headache any more i feel great and i'm just
sw2667A-ms98-a-0065 322.908500 334.295750 it's amazing how much better i feel and then just in general i sleep a lot better and i just feel much better i mean i've been kind of dragging the last few weeks and i know if i would just get around to exercising
sw2667A-ms98-a-0066 334.295750 344.960875 i'd fee[l]- feel better but my {dragginess} is my excuse for not exercising well i'm too tired or i have a headache or well i just got over the flu and i'm still kind of draggy so i better not go [laughter]
sw2667A-ms98-a-0067 344.960875 347.157875 yeah it really is
sw2667A-ms98-a-0068 347.157875 365.502375 [silence]
sw2667A-ms98-a-0069 365.502375 366.870500 right
sw2667A-ms98-a-0070 366.870500 373.116000 [silence]
sw2667A-ms98-a-0071 373.116000 374.637375 right
sw2667A-ms98-a-0072 374.637375 377.174750 [silence]
sw2667A-ms98-a-0073 377.174750 391.883375 it's just hard to make yourself go and i i think one thing i don't like about aerobics is that after i'm finished it's kind of late at night and i've been sweaty and and it you know i don't really feel like going in the grocery store all sweaty or running errands so it kind of kills the
sw2667A-ms98-a-0074 391.883375 403.915625 the evening for doing errands so i think a Tuesday Thursday might be a little bit better of course i feel like once i've done it if i'm sweaty i might as well do an extra thirty [laughter-more] [laughter-minutes] because you've already kind of shot your night but
sw2667A-ms98-a-0075 403.915625 414.705000 but um so i'm kind of glad they have a longer class on Tuesday Thursday now that i can just kill two nights and and uh get a reasonable amount of workout in so
sw2667A-ms98-a-0076 414.705000 415.723125 [silence]
sw2667A-ms98-a-0077 415.723125 425.613125 no it's less expensive this one was only forty five dollars but i'm glad it's not too totally cheap because if it was too cheap i would talk myself out of going more probably
sw2667A-ms98-a-0078 425.613125 430.692750 since it's more expensive i think okay you spent that much money you'd better go [laughter]
sw2667A-ms98-a-0079 430.692750 432.409750 so hopefully
sw2667A-ms98-a-0080 432.409750 434.044375 [silence]
sw2667A-ms98-a-0081 434.044375 441.756000 yeah yeah it's right there and it's they have a really nice facility at the TI they've got two different aerobics rooms they have the mirrors of course
sw2667A-ms98-a-0082 441.756000 449.667000 sometimes you don't like to see the mirrors [laughter-on] [laughter-the] [laughter-wall] you don't like to see how you work but i guess sometimes it kind of motivates you to really get going but
sw2667A-ms98-a-0083 449.667000 450.805875 [silence]
sw2667A-ms98-a-0084 450.805875 452.021250 uh-huh
sw2667A-ms98-a-0085 452.021250 463.219000 and they have ceiling fans in the rooms and it's it's a pretty nice setup um and of course it's real convenient because_1 it is right there at work i think if i had to come home and then go somewhere i'd never make it
sw2667A-ms98-a-0086 463.219000 469.410250 and just the fact that i can just go straight from my desk over to the the recreation center and do it helps a lot
sw2667A-ms98-a-0087 469.410250 474.140375 [silence]
sw2667A-ms98-a-0088 474.140375 475.824500 oh yeah [laughter]
sw2667A-ms98-a-0089 475.824500 478.514375 [silence]
sw2667A-ms98-a-0090 478.514375 492.162000 quite a few do they have probably ooh i'd say fifteen different fifteen to twenty different aerobics classes each session that are running and they have them anywhere from six in the morning uh they have some during
sw2667A-ms98-a-0091 492.162000 506.572875 during lunch hour that are shorter and i guess guys can take advantage of that for me i wouldn't have time to do an hour hour of aerobics and then take a shower [laughter-and] [laughter-get] get dressed again but there's a lot more guys that do that one and um
sw2667A-ms98-a-0092 506.572875 516.067000 they have them you know in the in the evenings they even have some late night ones for people that work second shift and things like that so they have big variety they even have some uh 
sw2667A-ms98-a-0093 516.067000 521.995250 aerobic uh water aerobics when the weather gets nice out in the pool i've never done that one before but
sw2667A-ms98-a-0094 521.995250 523.643500 uh-huh
sw2667A-ms98-a-0095 523.643500 530.136375 they've got an olympic pool and and basketball courts and sand volleyball they've got the full weight room and
sw2667A-ms98-a-0096 530.136375 541.202500 uh the locker rooms with uh a jacuzzi and sauna and the shower facilities and hair dryers and all the you know everything you'd need just about
sw2667A-ms98-a-0097 541.202500 552.368750 it's a real it is a real nice facility it's also got a full inside inside basketball court and i think they're working on building a jogging track and some other things but it's it is very nice
sw2667A-ms98-a-0098 552.368750 559.533625 i just don't take as much advantage of it as i should i mean i'm just now finally starting to do the aerobics thing but
sw2667A-ms98-a-0099 559.533625 565.680375 [silence]
sw2667A-ms98-a-0100 565.680375 572.477750 yeah well you can get a fitness membership that allows you to use the facilities and it's about eight dollars a month
sw2667A-ms98-a-0101 572.477750 575.977875 no not at [laughter-all] [laughter] pretty cheap
sw2667A-ms98-a-0102 575.977875 580.361250 so and then the aerobics cost extra even if you have the fitness membership but
sw2667A-ms98-a-0103 580.361250 584.958625 i think the aerobics classes are even pretty reasonably priced from what i've heard
sw2667A-ms98-a-0104 584.958625 591.006375 [silence]
sw2667A-ms98-a-0105 591.006375 592.134500 hm
sw2667A-ms98-a-0106 592.134500 593.324500 [silence]
sw2667A-ms98-a-0107 593.324500 599.167375 oh yeah in fact uh the T TIer's families can can come in on these things
