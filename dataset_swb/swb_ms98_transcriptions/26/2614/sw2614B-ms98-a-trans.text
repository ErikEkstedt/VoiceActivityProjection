sw2614B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 9.241500 [silence]
sw2614B-ms98-a-0002 9.241500 15.704875 uh-huh yeah well sometimes i'm home and sometimes i'm not but if i am it's always fun to talk
sw2614B-ms98-a-0003 15.704875 17.325000 [silence]
sw2614B-ms98-a-0004 17.325000 20.924500 i am as a matter of fact i'm at uh North Carolina State
sw2614B-ms98-a-0005 20.924500 31.609875 [silence]
sw2614B-ms98-a-0006 31.609875 35.129375 yeah i think i was the one who did that actually
sw2614B-ms98-a-0007 35.129375 39.866000 yeah i had a uh i teach a course in Voice I O Systems
sw2614B-ms98-a-0008 39.866000 40.899375 [silence]
sw2614B-ms98-a-0009 40.899375 50.981125 so i know uh you know i know about this project so i got my students to sign up and uh apparently a number of them have been participating
sw2614B-ms98-a-0010 50.981125 59.845875 [silence]
sw2614B-ms98-a-0011 59.845875 61.079375 uh-huh
sw2614B-ms98-a-0012 61.079375 69.062000 [silence]
sw2614B-ms98-a-0013 69.062000 70.413000 yeah
sw2614B-ms98-a-0014 70.413000 71.720750 [silence]
sw2614B-ms98-a-0015 71.720750 75.826875 uh let's see the subject is Latin America
sw2614B-ms98-a-0016 75.826875 85.021625 i don't know whether i have any real profound thoughts about that i actually wa[s]- was planning a trip to Latin America and i got warned off by
sw2614B-ms98-a-0017 85.021625 93.669250 some people they say Peru can't be traveled to and the crime rate in Brazil makes it not a pleasant place to go and so on and so forth
sw2614B-ms98-a-0018 93.669250 134.572125 [silence]
sw2614B-ms98-a-0019 134.572125 136.334125 yeah
sw2614B-ms98-a-0020 136.334125 160.206750 [silence]
sw2614B-ms98-a-0021 160.206750 165.563875 yeah i i don't understand it either although i i think a lot of South Americans
sw2614B-ms98-a-0022 165.563875 172.487875 regard the United States as as bullying and uh that's certainly from a historical point of view
sw2614B-ms98-a-0023 172.487875 183.336875 would be true i mean certainly we took far more from Mexico than Saddam Hussein ever dreamed of taking in in his wildest dreams from his neighbors
sw2614B-ms98-a-0024 183.336875 211.065000 [silence]
sw2614B-ms98-a-0025 211.065000 220.271875 yeah well i think they're going to have that's a tough row for them to to hoe because i think most of the world is going to regard
sw2614B-ms98-a-0026 220.271875 232.640875 uh citizens of the United States as Americans and citizens of Mexico as Mexicans and they can stand on their heads if they want too but i don't think that they're going they're going to change that and
sw2614B-ms98-a-0027 232.640875 246.263625 and and really i mean North Americans i think are when you say that even i think i mean i tend to think of Americans and Canadians i just don't think of Mexicans as being North Americans although i guess strictly speaking they are
sw2614B-ms98-a-0028 246.263625 252.130875 [silence]
sw2614B-ms98-a-0029 252.130875 254.607750 oh i see
sw2614B-ms98-a-0030 254.607750 257.998250 [silence]
sw2614B-ms98-a-0031 257.998250 259.601250 i don't know
sw2614B-ms98-a-0032 259.601250 261.431750 [silence]
sw2614B-ms98-a-0033 261.431750 267.957125 yeah well it's it's so interesting i ju[st]- i just don't think Mexico's problems are going to be cured by semantics
sw2614B-ms98-a-0034 267.957125 329.220625 [silence]
sw2614B-ms98-a-0035 329.220625 331.750000 yeah
sw2614B-ms98-a-0036 331.750000 343.513625 [silence]
sw2614B-ms98-a-0037 343.513625 345.010750 yeah
sw2614B-ms98-a-0038 345.010750 349.814125 [silence]
sw2614B-ms98-a-0039 349.814125 352.829000 well i grew up in Los Angeles
sw2614B-ms98-a-0040 352.829000 358.699375 and uh in fact i drove a cab when i was a graduate student so i i knew uh
sw2614B-ms98-a-0041 358.699375 362.044500 the Hispanic part of LA pretty well
sw2614B-ms98-a-0042 362.044500 373.275625 and certainly you know knew that problem knew you know knew about apartment houses that would have eight or ten or twelve people living in them sleeping in the same bed in shifts and all that
sw2614B-ms98-a-0043 373.275625 374.747500 and uh
sw2614B-ms98-a-0044 374.747500 376.516250 it was
sw2614B-ms98-a-0045 376.516250 378.478250 it was pretty wild
sw2614B-ms98-a-0046 378.478250 431.920625 [silence]
sw2614B-ms98-a-0047 431.920625 433.489750 yeah
sw2614B-ms98-a-0048 433.489750 452.484750 [silence]
sw2614B-ms98-a-0049 452.484750 454.214875 yeah
sw2614B-ms98-a-0050 454.214875 466.635000 [silence]
sw2614B-ms98-a-0051 466.635000 468.246625 yeah
sw2614B-ms98-a-0052 468.246625 470.361500 i'm sorry
sw2614B-ms98-a-0053 470.361500 473.032625 well i am actually
sw2614B-ms98-a-0054 473.032625 474.970000 yeah i'm the
sw2614B-ms98-a-0055 474.970000 478.415125 i'm the teacher i give [laughter]
sw2614B-ms98-a-0056 478.415125 479.713500 as it were
sw2614B-ms98-a-0057 479.713500 482.016000 [silence]
sw2614B-ms98-a-0058 482.016000 484.535250 yeah i'm in Computer Science
sw2614B-ms98-a-0059 484.535250 492.949000 and uh very interested in voice systems and in speech recognition but of course this project is really one to collect a data base of
sw2614B-ms98-a-0060 492.949000 501.505250 of uh of casual speech uh in an attempt to get some kind of a model of what speech is like
sw2614B-ms98-a-0061 501.505250 527.846625 [silence]
sw2614B-ms98-a-0062 527.846625 537.541875 yeah well they record these and then somebody transcribes them so that they they have uh they have a speech signal and what and what is said
sw2614B-ms98-a-0063 537.541875 548.492375 and they have a they're able to average it over a number of different occasions because peoples voices change a lot even from morning to evening and that's uh a big problem in speech recognition
sw2614B-ms98-a-0064 548.492375 560.043250 [silence]
sw2614B-ms98-a-0065 560.043250 561.897125 yeah
sw2614B-ms98-a-0066 561.897125 568.917125 [silence]
