sw2614A-ms98-a-0007 20.401375 32.078000 uh the reason i said that because i've had about uh three calls and my daughter had one too from different students out of North Carolina i guess they pass the names amongst your computer students or whatever
sw2614A-ms98-a-0008 32.078000 34.241875 [silence]
sw2614A-ms98-a-0009 34.241875 36.197000 oh is that ri[ght]- great great

sw2614A-ms98-a-0012 41.369000 50.321500 [silence]
sw2614A-ms98-a-0013 50.321500 60.533375 oh yeah i talked to one we're not on the subject of course i talked to one i think he had a whole bunch of calls he had a roommate that had calls and everything he had way more twice as many calls as as i've made uh
sw2614A-ms98-a-0014 60.533375 69.418250 and i i'm of course we at TI just hoping it works out that the new products that they come out will uh uh sell like gang books bu[sters]- busters really 
sw2614A-ms98-a-0015 69.418250 74.163875 okay you first on the subject wha[t]- what do you think about Latin America
sw2614A-ms98-a-0016 74.163875 76.103375 Latin America yeah
sw2614A-ms98-a-0017 76.103375 91.744000 [silence]
sw2614A-ms98-a-0018 91.744000 93.298000 oh really
sw2614A-ms98-a-0019 93.298000 106.111250 TI had a place i'm not to sure i don't think they do anymore down i think it was Campinas i'm not sure and uh i guess we were selling parts to the automotive industry or whatever and they had quite a few
sw2614A-ms98-a-0020 106.111250 116.446375 locations not quite a few several in Latin America i think the one in Mexico is closed and i think the one in in Brazil is closed but i 
sw2614A-ms98-a-0021 116.446375 122.779625 i don't know why that is a problem down there and i guess the crime rate is terrible up here too and uh
sw2614A-ms98-a-0022 122.779625 135.862250 and some people say go to New York but i don't i don't have an answer to the crime rate it's sad that is a sad situation i i'd like to go down to Mexico you know and i keep hearing that you know the government and and the crime rates pretty high too that that is sad
sw2614A-ms98-a-0023 135.862250 149.912875 uh not that we can uh sell any great program we have with crime but uh i think uh i'm kind of like you i don't have any strong opinions on it i guess maybe that's our biggest problem we have with our our neighbors down there is that we don't have any we have more
sw2614A-ms98-a-0024 149.912875 159.888000 i guess ties we in the United States have more ties to Europe and everything and we don't really aren't that close to everyone in South America i don't really know why though
sw2614A-ms98-a-0025 159.888000 172.542750 [silence]
sw2614A-ms98-a-0026 172.542750 173.754625 right
sw2614A-ms98-a-0027 173.754625 182.528750 [silence]
sw2614A-ms98-a-0028 182.528750 192.726750 right yeah i know that i saw in a book i was reading a Spanish book uh not that i read Spanish you know i just you know reading some Spanish words and there was a comment in there about
sw2614A-ms98-a-0029 192.726750 201.672875 the Mexicans don't really want us to say we're Americans they would like to say that we're North Americans because they're Americans too you know and i guess that's true we don't think of
sw2614A-ms98-a-0030 201.672875 212.416625 any one else but oursel[ves]- i guess we're kind of uh the smart asses in the world i suppose uh or of America anyway we think of ourselves as the only Americans when they're Americans too
sw2614A-ms98-a-0031 212.416625 224.768875 [silence]
sw2614A-ms98-a-0032 224.768875 227.486625 as Mexicans yes that that
sw2614A-ms98-a-0033 227.486625 229.506000 [laughter]
sw2614A-ms98-a-0034 229.506000 231.995125 [silence]
sw2614A-ms98-a-0035 231.995125 234.005250 no no i know
sw2614A-ms98-a-0036 234.005250 245.777625 [silence]
sw2614A-ms98-a-0037 245.777625 258.802375 yeah no i mean they were saying that of us that we're the North Americans and they're Americans they they we always say we're Americans and they they want us to say we're the North Americans we're not Americans we're North Americans and they're South Americans yeah
sw2614A-ms98-a-0038 258.802375 263.393500 whatever i i don't want to make i read it somewhere though it's not my point i guess [laughter]
sw2614A-ms98-a-0039 263.393500 268.171750 [silence]
sw2614A-ms98-a-0040 268.171750 278.756625 no no they they were lucky enough to have some oil what ten years ago an and they they blew all that and borrowed enou[gh]- more money than they can pay back now and uh
sw2614A-ms98-a-0041 278.756625 290.831750 uh so they're not exactly business men i do think we should deal more with them i don't i do have a lot of sympathy in that we're here in Texas uh for the language you know is very foolish
sw2614A-ms98-a-0042 290.831750 305.487000 i'm relative relatively familiar with Texas school system and we should teach Spanish at least in uh grammar school you know four or five grades of it so that we can speak Spanish i think that helps
sw2614A-ms98-a-0043 305.487000 317.159500 when you certainly can speak their language uh and there are problems with you know the wet back problem you know for everyone knows what we're talking about when say wet back problem and then we should somehow
sw2614A-ms98-a-0044 317.159500 332.005625 uh and i think the governments are working on that to try to have some uh businesses uh at the borders of both sides so that you can you don't have this problem of them trying to come up here and to to get the jobs you know there there may be some organized way to do this
sw2614A-ms98-a-0045 332.005625 344.820500 i i do feel for them uh they are very envious of us or they wouldn't be coming up here you know risking a lot not that they're risking their lives of course but risking a lot uh getting thrown back i guess is all that uh happens
sw2614A-ms98-a-0046 344.820500 352.668750 you probably don't see that where we see it you know once a month i'm sure in San Antonio they see it more often than that [vocalized-noise] 
sw2614A-ms98-a-0047 352.668750 354.975625 okay well you see it saw it out there then too
sw2614A-ms98-a-0048 354.975625 362.199500 [silence]
sw2614A-ms98-a-0049 362.199500 363.257750 uh-huh
sw2614A-ms98-a-0050 363.257750 373.657375 [silence]
sw2614A-ms98-a-0051 373.657375 374.898500 yeah
sw2614A-ms98-a-0052 374.898500 379.004875 [silence]
sw2614A-ms98-a-0053 379.004875 391.498500 i think a a common factor to a lot of problems both whether it be crime if if you want to jump on that is mostly uh poverty uh and i think a lot of their problems is poverty if we could
sw2614A-ms98-a-0054 391.498500 405.716250 uh uh the problems we have you know in this country is is a lot of it's poverty whether it's the people aren't trying hard enough to get out of poverty i that's another story but uh uh it is sad there there's so much down in all of South America
sw2614A-ms98-a-0055 405.716250 419.140625 uh so much potential you know we're TI of course is is really pushing world markets in their products and they're they're mostly in in Europe now and in in in the Orient Japan and Singapore now just announced
sw2614A-ms98-a-0056 419.140625 434.103125 building a plant in Singapore uh they're in Taiwan and Japan and they're they haven't had what that much luck in South America and there's got to be a lot of potential for business down there for the products certainly that we make and everything
sw2614A-ms98-a-0057 434.103125 449.092250 there's got to be trade i guess that's some of the answer i guess is business uh uh and i try to be an optimist and say well that that's one way is to help any problem whether it be crime or certainly poverty obviously is to is to get some business going between each other 
sw2614A-ms98-a-0058 449.092250 455.103750 and we need we need to do more of that uh somehow and encourage more business between us
sw2614A-ms98-a-0059 455.103750 466.680250 they've got to have a lot of resources i would think an enormous amount of of well potential that way a lot of it of course is hot and jungle and all that but uh there's got to be a lot of potential down there
sw2614A-ms98-a-0060 466.680250 467.835250 [silence]
sw2614A-ms98-a-0061 467.835250 470.376625 what are what are you taking in school i didn't ask you that
sw2614A-ms98-a-0062 470.376625 472.287375 what are you taking in school
sw2614A-ms98-a-0063 472.287375 474.895500 oh you you're an instructor yeah you're an instructor yeah you said
sw2614A-ms98-a-0064 474.895500 479.064750 [silence]
sw2614A-ms98-a-0065 479.064750 480.732875 that's great 
sw2614A-ms98-a-0066 480.732875 484.670125 are you teaching Computer Science wha[t]- you said what were you saying you were teaching there 
sw2614A-ms98-a-0067 484.670125 486.666375 great great
sw2614A-ms98-a-0068 486.666375 500.814500 [silence]
sw2614A-ms98-a-0069 500.814500 502.776750 right
sw2614A-ms98-a-0070 502.776750 514.214375 i of course i work at TI and i'm a little puzzled as to why when they get my voice one time why that isn't enough i mean i'm i'm i'm getting a kick out of the whole program but uh
sw2614A-ms98-a-0071 514.214375 524.039000 there's going to be i guess thousands i don't know how many thousands or tens of thousands of these recordings and i wonder how they're going to analyze them whether it would be
sw2614A-ms98-a-0072 524.039000 529.888625 listening to them or analyzing i g[uess]- they've got to be analyzing with a a voice recorder some how
sw2614A-ms98-a-0073 529.888625 532.864750 [silence]
sw2614A-ms98-a-0074 532.864750 534.039250 uh-huh
sw2614A-ms98-a-0075 534.039250 538.471500 [silence]
sw2614A-ms98-a-0076 538.471500 539.509875 right
sw2614A-ms98-a-0077 539.509875 549.466875 [silence]
sw2614A-ms98-a-0078 549.466875 563.483125 oh yes i know they change with age i know mine changes uh has changed uh although you you never found your your voice echoes in your own head which is makes it different than what it really sounds to other people uh 
sw2614A-ms98-a-0079 563.483125 570.754375 i'm sure singers and professional people know that and you always hear your own voice in recordings and say my God that's that's not obviously that's not me you know 
sw2614A-ms98-a-0080 570.754375 574.965000 but uh i know your voice in your own head resonates a different way
sw2614A-ms98-a-0081 574.965000 576.926375 uh 
sw2614A-ms98-a-0082 576.926375 589.712125 go ahead you you comment on it yeah i'm glad that you're in the business that i know TI's gotten it with their Speak and Spell and everything i've told my wife that one of the reasons they're doing it is because eventually you'll be able to talk to your computer you wouldn't have to have a keyboard 
sw2614A-ms98-a-0083 589.712125 598.682000 you'll be able to just give it commands and i'm sure they have some of that now and not not in computers but a lot of potential of course for handicapped people
