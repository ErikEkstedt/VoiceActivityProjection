sw2644A-ms98-a-0012 37.497250 40.254875 uh North Carolina State University
sw2644A-ms98-a-0013 40.254875 41.516375 yeah
sw2644A-ms98-a-0014 41.516375 49.220375 [silence]
sw2644A-ms98-a-0015 49.220375 60.499875 yeah i think it's it's when you're looking for a college that you want to go i think you really should know exactly what you want to be so you can pick the best quality
sw2644A-ms98-a-0016 60.499875 61.996250 [silence]
sw2644A-ms98-a-0017 61.996250 70.360000 i chose it basically that way uh North Carolina State has a reputation for being uh good agricultural school
sw2644A-ms98-a-0018 70.360000 72.496250 in the area
sw2644A-ms98-a-0019 72.496250 81.970250 exactly and um they have a good extension service for agriculture and uh i wanted to go into agriculture so i came here
sw2644A-ms98-a-0020 81.970250 96.459250 and since since i was in you know in-state i pay re[sident]- i pay resident tuition so it was also a it was also good for me because you know being a good school plus in-state tuition saved me a lot of money
sw2644A-ms98-a-0021 96.459250 107.488875 [silence]
sw2644A-ms98-a-0022 107.488875 119.495875 right well for example yeah yeah i- i think that's very true because for example uh i'm going to graduate school after i finish here and uh i'm going to go to California
sw2644A-ms98-a-0023 119.495875 135.230875 [silence]
sw2644A-ms98-a-0024 135.230875 136.991250 that's true
sw2644A-ms98-a-0025 136.991250 140.489375 yeah i mean they would like for you to stay so that you know
sw2644A-ms98-a-0026 140.489375 147.991250 they they could keep getting your money but one you know an employer likes to see different schools i think
sw2644A-ms98-a-0027 147.991250 173.464875 [silence]
sw2644A-ms98-a-0028 173.464875 175.490125 right
sw2644A-ms98-a-0029 175.490125 181.987000 [silence]
sw2644A-ms98-a-0030 181.987000 190.206250 right they have in California they have a lot of heavy metal problems also and a lot of salts because of the valleys v[ery]- very salty
sw2644A-ms98-a-0031 190.206250 196.249625 that's what i- i was interested when i went over there i- i uh talked to some people in the university
sw2644A-ms98-a-0032 196.249625 205.471625 i think also you know um dialogue between university professors helps a lot in decisions because i think that's what really turned me
sw2644A-ms98-a-0033 205.471625 218.956875 towards that you know the the school that i'm going to is i went and talked to the people in the school and they gave me information which i could not have gotten otherwise and that that really finalized my decision
sw2644A-ms98-a-0034 218.956875 219.961000 [silence]
sw2644A-ms98-a-0035 219.961000 231.278750 well i'm graduating with just a soil science degree here in North Carolina but i hopefully will go to California to receive a PhD in uh
sw2644A-ms98-a-0036 231.278750 236.714875 soil science with a specialization in environmental [vocalized-noise] environmental quality
sw2644A-ms98-a-0037 236.714875 251.279875 which will deal with uh eco-toxicology heavy metals and soils and things like that so away from the production agriculture end of it and more into the soils and you know contaminants
sw2644A-ms98-a-0038 251.279875 252.291125 [silence]
sw2644A-ms98-a-0039 252.291125 262.728500 so i'm kind of branching off into a pretty specific region which i think is going to be a hot topic in the future with you know all these lands and and things that are being spoiled
sw2644A-ms98-a-0040 262.728500 266.008000 and how to how to remediate them and all
sw2644A-ms98-a-0041 266.008000 275.983125 [silence]
