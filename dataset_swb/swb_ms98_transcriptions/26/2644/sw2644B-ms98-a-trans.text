sw2644B-ms98-a-0014 51.470250 59.983250 [silence]

sw2644B-ms98-a-0016 62.741500 69.759000 [silence]
sw2644B-ms98-a-0017 69.759000 73.179375 um-hum it's a land grant university right

sw2644B-ms98-a-0021 83.494875 95.420875 [silence]
sw2644B-ms98-a-0022 95.420875 107.659750 oh yes it certainly does and familiarity with the area there's sometimes advantages to moving way off and going to a unknown area but uh there's as many
sw2644B-ms98-a-0023 107.659750 108.677375 [silence]
sw2644B-ms98-a-0024 108.677375 110.770750 to stay in the same area
sw2644B-ms98-a-0025 110.770750 118.714000 [silence]
sw2644B-ms98-a-0026 118.714000 124.955875 yeah uh two reasons for that i think if they even recommend in advanced degrees to
sw2644B-ms98-a-0027 124.955875 135.499625 uh try a different set of teachers get a different perspective as far as the the advanced degrees they'd like for you to change rather than stay in the same institution
sw2644B-ms98-a-0028 135.499625 136.517000 [silence]
sw2644B-ms98-a-0029 136.517000 137.707750 yeah

sw2644B-ms98-a-0032 143.662500 146.458250 [silence]
sw2644B-ms98-a-0033 146.458250 156.489250 um-hum and i and i think a very good advisor would uh tell you that it's best for you anyway to get a different uh
sw2644B-ms98-a-0034 156.489250 165.219500 different set of instructors on it and a little different outlook and plus there are regional differences i think too California may have a different
sw2644B-ms98-a-0035 165.219500 179.495625 type of emphasis now agriculture changes by region as far as it's emphasis is concerned middle of the country would be wheat land here it's tobacco and uh California it may be
sw2644B-ms98-a-0036 179.495625 183.982375 uh more of the grapes and and uh other types of
sw2644B-ms98-a-0037 183.982375 185.968375 [silence]
sw2644B-ms98-a-0038 185.968375 187.955625 oh yes

sw2644B-ms98-a-0049 262.696750 264.358375 no question
sw2644B-ms98-a-0050 264.358375 265.519500 [silence]
sw2644B-ms98-a-0051 265.519500 271.009750 no question you i'm sure you you and your classmates have been following the uh
sw2644B-ms98-a-0052 271.009750 277.749750 waste situation in North Carolina and the the absence or facility to handle
sw2644B-ms98-a-0053 277.749750 283.657875 right and it's it's a universal problem you know
sw2644B-ms98-a-0054 283.657875 293.457750 if you look at uh some countries you expect them to have problems Latin America now with cholera and and a bunch of other problems associated with
sw2644B-ms98-a-0055 293.457750 295.488500 waste management
sw2644B-ms98-a-0056 295.488500 305.939500 the United States you can expect more out of but we still have the same very deep problem of how to take care of our waste we create a bunch now now what do we do with it
sw2644B-ms98-a-0057 305.939500 312.944750 [silence]
sw2644B-ms98-a-0058 312.944750 320.732250 yeah and then i think there's a a big mistrust public mistrust as there is with nuclear energy
sw2644B-ms98-a-0059 320.732250 328.245500 uh they were talking about Chernobyl again this this week because it's an anniversary but i think there's a big mistrust of uh
sw2644B-ms98-a-0060 328.245500 334.955000 some of the waste management companies in terms of how well they do take care of their product
sw2644B-ms98-a-0061 334.955000 339.997625 and that's got to be solved i think there has to be public trust in it before you can
sw2644B-ms98-a-0062 339.997625 342.275625 find a good sight
sw2644B-ms98-a-0063 342.275625 343.327750 [silence]
