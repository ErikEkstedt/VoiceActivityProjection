sw2666A-ms98-a-0002 0.960000 12.677500 well i guess uh the topic uh being favorite TV shows i uh i guess i could start by saying i'm just looking forward to uh watching the astronomers on PBS
sw2666A-ms98-a-0003 12.677500 25.366875 and uh unfortunately they're having a [vocalized-noise] like but they're having the uh a uh not telethon but a uh auction on on PBS here and

sw2666A-ms98-a-0007 31.201125 40.912125 well the first uh episode started out pretty [laughter-slow] but after that it uh obviously has been preempted by the auction the last week or so so it uh i guess i'll never know
sw2666A-ms98-a-0008 40.912125 42.710875 but uh and you
sw2666A-ms98-a-0009 42.710875 47.715000 [silence]

sw2666A-ms98-a-0022 72.449875 86.197375 i would imagine about the only time i usually preempt for i think like Monday night we usually uh watch a lot of TV because that's when Murphy Brown and uh and Designing Women a lot of those shows are on we tend to wa[tch]- always catch those
sw2666A-ms98-a-0023 86.197375 88.169875 and
sw2666A-ms98-a-0024 88.169875 89.834750 In the Heat of the Night
sw2666A-ms98-a-0025 89.834750 92.621750 that's uh th[at]- i[s]- Carroll O'Connor yeah

sw2666A-ms98-a-0031 103.229375 112.446250 yeah well i guess i guess now that they've uh got rid of Dallas which we uh we tend to watch religiously here at uh [vocalized-noise] a[t]- at least we're getting ready for the big final episode 
sw2666A-ms98-a-0032 112.446250 115.412375 [silence]
sw2666A-ms98-a-0033 115.412375 116.784250 yeah i

sw2666A-ms98-a-0035 119.234625 125.369125 it's it's funny how they're uh now that the show's over they're kind of trying to complete all of these uh stories
sw2666A-ms98-a-0036 125.369125 130.289500 in a very short period of time so it's like you turn on about eighty seven things happen in an episode now
sw2666A-ms98-a-0037 130.289500 131.990750 and uh
sw2666A-ms98-a-0038 131.990750 133.691875 [silence]
sw2666A-ms98-a-0039 133.691875 142.630000 um-hum i guess uh the only rumor i've heard that they had in the papers so far is that uh the last episode is supposed to be like uh it's a wonderful life for JR
sw2666A-ms98-a-0040 142.630000 150.432000 so it's uh what what would life had been like if he w[ould]- had not been born there something like that so uh it's 
sw2666A-ms98-a-0041 150.432000 153.157500 it's going to be funny i [laughter-bet]
sw2666A-ms98-a-0042 153.157500 157.250000 so[mething]- something tells me Larry Hagman's going to milk this role that uh all it's worth
sw2666A-ms98-a-0043 157.250000 158.615125 but uh
sw2666A-ms98-a-0044 158.615125 162.571500 [silence]
sw2666A-ms98-a-0045 162.571500 166.839000 no no not at all not at all that's uh that's true
sw2666A-ms98-a-0046 166.839000 167.879125 but
sw2666A-ms98-a-0047 167.879125 168.919125 [silence]
sw2666A-ms98-a-0048 168.919125 177.958875 oh do y[ou]- i i very rarely unfortunately it it comes on a little early here and i some[times]- i'm usually at work but they moved it to Thursdays and i guess that's what uh
sw2666A-ms98-a-0049 177.958875 183.430000 but uh yeah the the few times that i've been able to see it it's uh at first i didn't think so
sw2666A-ms98-a-0050 183.430000 192.354750 and when i first saw it i i haven't been able to see it very often but when i first saw it i said well well this looks like it's it's going to you know go over like a lead balloon it uh doesn't look like it's going to be good at all
sw2666A-ms98-a-0051 192.354750 196.030000 but the few times i've seen it i guess it's something that grows on you
sw2666A-ms98-a-0052 196.030000 198.004875 yeah
sw2666A-ms98-a-0053 198.004875 200.953750 [silence]

sw2666A-ms98-a-0057 207.798500 213.501125 the the big thing i always hear about is i guess at the beginning they always open it a little differently where they all run to the sofa
sw2666A-ms98-a-0058 213.501125 217.718750 [silence]
sw2666A-ms98-a-0059 217.718750 227.706625 yeah that's it and then sometimes you know the [vocalized-noise] like one episode i guess the sofa wasn't even there and they all just stood there and looked at each other and and stuff like that so so i hear a lot about that 
sw2666A-ms98-a-0060 227.706625 234.599625 and uh it's a[lmost]- it's almost up there with uh Saturday Night Live i guess is the big now with that is the the guy with uh
sw2666A-ms98-a-0061 234.599625 245.835875 you know like Steve uh Steve Meister and and it's like wherever i go anymore i've uh i get got a chance not only to to visit a few companies and all that around here and uh
sw2666A-ms98-a-0062 245.835875 252.329500 it's like you walk into a lobbies of those places it's like you know Ralph Ralph Meister Ralphster and uh it's uh 
sw2666A-ms98-a-0063 252.329500 256.690125 yep so it's like that's something that's really really taken off but uh
sw2666A-ms98-a-0064 256.690125 260.349750 [silence]
sw2666A-ms98-a-0065 260.349750 261.762750 um-hum

sw2666A-ms98-a-0067 264.193125 269.830000 right right because_1 uh isn't that special i guess is the last one with uh with the church lady but uh
sw2666A-ms98-a-0068 269.830000 273.675500 [silence]
sw2666A-ms98-a-0069 273.675500 275.774625 oh uh
sw2666A-ms98-a-0070 275.774625 279.069875 uh it's al[ways]- not it's always something but uh
sw2666A-ms98-a-0071 279.069875 280.186125 when she
sw2666A-ms98-a-0072 280.186125 281.302250 [silence]

sw2666A-ms98-a-0096 375.133250 384.880000 yeah y[eah]- matter of fact uh i guess that's going to be the s[ame]- same uh what Dallas and uh LA Law and a lot of these are really uh i guess are really going for a lot of cliffhangers this year 
sw2666A-ms98-a-0097 384.880000 386.268625 and they keep uh

sw2666A-ms98-a-0105 403.310875 416.399750 it it's pretty obvious though like Corbin Benson is probably not going to be there long because_1 he's been starring in these uh miniseries and and his part's gotten smaller and smaller and they're bringing on the uh like the British uh lawyer who uh
sw2666A-ms98-a-0106 416.399750 425.698000 i guess her and and the blonde uh district attorney or [vocalized-noise] went went to teach that seminar to the Russian uh Russian lawyers at the uh 
sw2666A-ms98-a-0107 425.698000 437.670000 at the swimming pool there in Palm Springs and uh you can see they're really starting to build up their characters and they've they've kind of really down played like uh Corbin Benson and uh few of those uh the top ones Harry Hamlin a lot of them_1
