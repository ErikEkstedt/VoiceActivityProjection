sw2622B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.041625 [silence]
sw2622B-ms98-a-0002 1.041625 3.088375 so uh what do you think [laughter]
sw2622B-ms98-a-0003 3.088375 5.384500 [silence]
sw2622B-ms98-a-0004 5.384500 6.866500 yeah
sw2622B-ms98-a-0005 6.866500 24.503000 [silence]
sw2622B-ms98-a-0006 24.503000 27.730375 oh really so they have n[o]- i didn't realize they had no state tax in Texas
sw2622B-ms98-a-0007 27.730375 28.880500 [silence]
sw2622B-ms98-a-0008 28.880500 32.373625 oh that's great because they don't have it in Florida in New York they have it
sw2622B-ms98-a-0009 32.373625 36.403125 i mean you know like i say i'm in New York and we have a state tax as well
sw2622B-ms98-a-0010 36.403125 38.299500 so that just cuts even more
sw2622B-ms98-a-0011 38.299500 42.682625 [silence]
sw2622B-ms98-a-0012 42.682625 51.870500 right i i think that i i mean i wouldn't be so upset about the amount of taxes paid if it weren't for the fact that they don't they don't go to any place
sw2622B-ms98-a-0013 51.870500 55.549375 you know y[ou]- you don't see it going to any place where it belongs
sw2622B-ms98-a-0014 55.549375 57.742250 i think if it were to be uh
sw2622B-ms98-a-0015 57.742250 59.424750 if it were to be um
sw2622B-ms98-a-0016 59.424750 63.002250 if it were to be hold hold on a second please someone just walked in the door
sw2622B-ms98-a-0017 63.002250 65.886250 [noise]
sw2622B-ms98-a-0018 65.886250 75.615875 if if it were to be spent in the right way i think i wouldn't be so upset about it but given that it that it's not spent properly i think it's a major problem 
sw2622B-ms98-a-0019 75.615875 90.069875 [silence]
sw2622B-ms98-a-0020 90.069875 94.681750 well that's certainly true well what is it they were just talking about um
sw2622B-ms98-a-0021 94.681750 105.696000 sort of middle income you know how how middle income people what winds up happening is for instance having kids you know they wind up having kids as a deduction and after
sw2622B-ms98-a-0022 105.696000 112.188250 but the deduction is so little for kids that they wind up having to pay more in taxes than it costs to raise a kid for the year or something
sw2622B-ms98-a-0023 112.188250 118.846500 i think tha[t]- so they want to you know try an[d]- i think they're trying i think tha[t]- i think that most of the politicians understand this
sw2622B-ms98-a-0024 118.846500 123.714500 they just don't they're just not very good at doing what they're supposed to be doing
sw2622B-ms98-a-0025 123.714500 131.354500 [silence]
sw2622B-ms98-a-0026 131.354500 132.729250 right
sw2622B-ms98-a-0027 132.729250 144.743250 [silence]
sw2622B-ms98-a-0028 144.743250 146.344875 uh-huh
sw2622B-ms98-a-0029 146.344875 149.996125 [silence]
sw2622B-ms98-a-0030 149.996125 151.496500 i agree
sw2622B-ms98-a-0031 151.496500 152.722625 i agree
sw2622B-ms98-a-0032 152.722625 165.766625 [silence]
sw2622B-ms98-a-0033 165.766625 168.942000 right exactly and then and then uh
sw2622B-ms98-a-0034 168.942000 180.557000 uh i'm i'm just not sure if i see you know if i see it going like i say to the right places i mean it'd be it'd be one thing if it were taking a bite out of your savings and then you were getting it all back when you got older
sw2622B-ms98-a-0035 180.557000 185.449125 you know but i'm not convinced that's a that that Social Security is doing as well as it should and
sw2622B-ms98-a-0036 185.449125 197.474500 you know and and and uh and and that you know those people who need it for welfare and so forth who really need it for welfare not the eighty five to ninety percent of them who don't need it but i mean the real people who really need it
sw2622B-ms98-a-0037 197.474500 201.048125 you know should be getting it but instead i think it's going to the wrong places
sw2622B-ms98-a-0038 201.048125 205.149625 [silence]
sw2622B-ms98-a-0039 205.149625 206.677000 you think so
sw2622B-ms98-a-0040 206.677000 211.693125 [silence]
sw2622B-ms98-a-0041 211.693125 214.998625 i know and that scares the hell out of me
sw2622B-ms98-a-0042 214.998625 224.632000 [silence]
sw2622B-ms98-a-0043 224.632000 225.489625 yeah
sw2622B-ms98-a-0044 225.489625 228.175125 [silence]
sw2622B-ms98-a-0045 228.175125 241.775500 yeah i don't i don't well becau[se]- because they're the ones who make the laws [laughter] so who's going to yell at them you know it'd be nice if we sort of as one band together and and uh and an performed a citizens arrest i guess
sw2622B-ms98-a-0046 241.775500 247.676125 to see if we could sort of clean them up and you know but i don't know if we can do that or not
sw2622B-ms98-a-0047 247.676125 265.839875 [silence]
sw2622B-ms98-a-0048 265.839875 275.290000 i agree i agree but um yeah like like you said i wonder you know if if it's certainly not going to be a slow change process and i wonder if it'll ever be a change process
sw2622B-ms98-a-0049 275.290000 280.236750 i sort of i sort of get discouraged when i think about all the things that i think are wrong
sw2622B-ms98-a-0050 280.236750 283.387000 you know all those things that really could be changed that
sw2622B-ms98-a-0051 283.387000 289.160250 aren't you know that that that aren't and taxes is one of those things that just sort of sits way up there on the list 
sw2622B-ms98-a-0052 289.160250 290.926750 [silence]
sw2622B-ms98-a-0053 290.926750 294.080375 so i don't know i i i have no idea what to do about it
sw2622B-ms98-a-0054 294.080375 326.830750 [silence]
sw2622B-ms98-a-0055 326.830750 327.891250 yeah
sw2622B-ms98-a-0056 327.891250 330.601125 [silence]
sw2622B-ms98-a-0057 330.601125 337.073625 right we don't i mean the only say so we have is supposedly by electing people who we think are going to vote one way of another
sw2622B-ms98-a-0058 337.073625 342.776875 [silence]
sw2622B-ms98-a-0059 342.776875 344.010875 right
sw2622B-ms98-a-0060 344.010875 350.000375 i've never quite understood that i've never uh you know even though um um i i've never been 
sw2622B-ms98-a-0061 350.000375 354.515000 uh sort of politically minded but it's never been clear to me as to sort of
sw2622B-ms98-a-0062 354.515000 355.534875 um
sw2622B-ms98-a-0063 355.534875 362.968375 you know how Congressmen an can can just sort of go ahead and vote their own conscience as their own ideas
sw2622B-ms98-a-0064 362.968375 367.006250 when clearly their constituency doe[s]- doesn't back them up on anything you know
sw2622B-ms98-a-0065 367.006250 369.224625 and often times that will happen
sw2622B-ms98-a-0066 369.224625 372.095375 [silence]
sw2622B-ms98-a-0067 372.095375 372.948250 right
sw2622B-ms98-a-0068 372.948250 385.567000 [silence]
sw2622B-ms98-a-0069 385.567000 387.029875 right
sw2622B-ms98-a-0070 387.029875 389.394500 [silence]
sw2622B-ms98-a-0071 389.394500 403.280500 they do forget it's true coul[d]- because everybody think of what happens is whenever the politic[ian]- whenever th[e]- the one who made that supposed mistake turns around and uh his his or her opponent can say well look they did this and they can turn around and say well my opponent did this
sw2622B-ms98-a-0072 403.280500 405.106750 so it becomes uh
sw2622B-ms98-a-0073 405.106750 407.214250 a general battle of
sw2622B-ms98-a-0074 407.214250 411.232750 the w[ho]- um the uh sort of election of the lesser of two evils 
sw2622B-ms98-a-0075 411.232750 412.414000 i think so
sw2622B-ms98-a-0076 412.414000 413.934125 i don't know
sw2622B-ms98-a-0077 413.934125 420.950375 i just uh i'm unhappy with it but and well i'm i'm sort of semi fortunate right now i'm a graduate student
sw2622B-ms98-a-0078 420.950375 427.244125 so i don't make that much and what i make isn't taxed very highly because i'm still in school 
sw2622B-ms98-a-0079 427.244125 428.250000 but
sw2622B-ms98-a-0080 428.250000 429.390000 it's
sw2622B-ms98-a-0081 429.390000 439.412625 my my my my wife has a real job and you know when i get her job um you know we we look at her paycheck i'm just floored when i see how little of it we're actually allowed to keep 
sw2622B-ms98-a-0082 439.412625 441.309500 [silence]
sw2622B-ms98-a-0083 441.309500 443.686625 especially around bonus time
sw2622B-ms98-a-0084 443.686625 446.917750 bonus she no my my wife does
sw2622B-ms98-a-0085 446.917750 451.715875 my wi[fe]- i don['t]- no graduate students don't get bonuses we're lucky to get paychecks the way i figure
sw2622B-ms98-a-0086 451.715875 453.140875 [silence]
sw2622B-ms98-a-0087 453.140875 456.683875 my my wife is taxed on her bonus as well and that's a
sw2622B-ms98-a-0088 456.683875 465.067250 that's usually a big chunk of her bonus check actually i mean her bonus isn't that much but they tax it as i i guess they tax it as if
sw2622B-ms98-a-0089 465.067250 468.466750 that were her weekly check or something
sw2622B-ms98-a-0090 468.466750 471.205875 so she gets destroyed on her bonus check
sw2622B-ms98-a-0091 471.205875 474.761500 so she works with in in in sales
sw2622B-ms98-a-0092 474.761500 480.125875 so a good portion of her you know her salary is is quarterly bonuses
sw2622B-ms98-a-0093 480.125875 485.309000 [silence]
sw2622B-ms98-a-0094 485.309000 493.849000 yes well yeah she's not entirely sales so it isn't it isn't as lucrative as one would hope but it it keeps us supported temporarily
sw2622B-ms98-a-0095 493.849000 497.000375 until i can get a real salary and then get taxed more
sw2622B-ms98-a-0096 497.000375 502.997250 so i don't know i d[on't]- i guess i guess at this point in time we're just sort of going to have to live with it
sw2622B-ms98-a-0097 502.997250 504.983250 and hope that it gets better
sw2622B-ms98-a-0098 504.983250 512.814625 [silence]
sw2622B-ms98-a-0099 512.814625 515.159375 same here tough topic so
sw2622B-ms98-a-0100 515.159375 518.287375 [silence]
