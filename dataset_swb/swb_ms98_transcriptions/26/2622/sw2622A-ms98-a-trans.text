sw2622A-ms98-a-0004 11.472500 16.262750 uh most all government entities are just trying to give us a state
sw2622A-ms98-a-0005 16.262750 24.939375 income tax for those who don't have it that is i mean we don't have one yet but eventually they may try to push it through
sw2622A-ms98-a-0006 24.939375 27.623250 [silence]

sw2622A-ms98-a-0018 76.506125 81.698875 really overburdened from federal state and local
sw2622A-ms98-a-0019 81.698875 86.040250 that it takes such a size out of your paycheck that
sw2622A-ms98-a-0020 86.040250 87.456750 [silence]
sw2622A-ms98-a-0021 87.456750 90.627875 there's not a whole lot you can always do with your paycheck

sw2622A-ms98-a-0025 122.957000 127.677000 well they're kind of put into a trap of being
sw2622A-ms98-a-0026 127.677000 132.567625 out there to please the special interest groups as well
sw2622A-ms98-a-0027 132.567625 140.815375 and uh i think the only way that can be changed for us to get a a better tax revenue
sw2622A-ms98-a-0028 140.815375 144.730250 that's fairness and all is for us to limit their terms
sw2622A-ms98-a-0029 144.730250 146.072500 [silence]
sw2622A-ms98-a-0030 146.072500 149.657500 and by doing so they're not obligated to anybody

sw2622A-ms98-a-0034 153.840000 160.665750 uh i don't know how we're going to do that right away though but what what in general though that taxes are doing to us is 
sw2622A-ms98-a-0035 160.665750 161.911125 [silence]
sw2622A-ms98-a-0036 161.911125 165.739125 it's just taking uh [noise] a bite out of our savings

sw2622A-ms98-a-0044 214.394750 221.844375 and i bet that's illegal see if uh most company uh CEOs were to do that
sw2622A-ms98-a-0045 221.844375 224.632125 within their private company they'd be in jail
sw2622A-ms98-a-0046 224.632125 228.701625 [laughter] so how are we letting them get away with it
