sw2673B-ms98-a-0004 15.974750 23.487750 well i thought the second part of the question you know how do you perceive life in the United States differently
sw2673B-ms98-a-0005 23.487750 27.498000 you know as opposed to ten to fifteen years ago um
sw2673B-ms98-a-0006 27.498000 32.975750 you know that one [laughter] my oldest children are
sw2673B-ms98-a-0007 32.975750 34.979625 are fifteen
sw2673B-ms98-a-0008 34.979625 36.303750 so
sw2673B-ms98-a-0009 36.303750 42.004250 that's huh you know that that was immediately what clicked in my head what do i see now
sw2673B-ms98-a-0010 42.004250 45.975000 different than i do you know when they were born
sw2673B-ms98-a-0011 45.975000 53.749750 you know um i have my oldest are two girls they are fifteen and fourteen
sw2673B-ms98-a-0012 53.749750 58.299000 so not quite fourteen the um
sw2673B-ms98-a-0013 58.299000 71.188500 i think we're seeing lots and lots of [laughter] of changes as regarding families you know at that point i felt like i was one of the few people that truly wanted t[o]- children
sw2673B-ms98-a-0014 71.188500 75.988750 and now i think you're seeing that a little bit more it's coming back again
sw2673B-ms98-a-0015 75.988750 77.705875 and
sw2673B-ms98-a-0016 77.705875 81.994875 but people are certainly having their children their families later
sw2673B-ms98-a-0017 81.994875 83.684125 you know it's not
sw2673B-ms98-a-0018 83.684125 85.995000 [silence]
sw2673B-ms98-a-0019 85.995000 94.032750 and the ones that are having them earlier they're having them a lot earlier [laughter] like eleven [laughter] or ten [laughter]
sw2673B-ms98-a-0020 94.032750 98.984875 [silence]
sw2673B-ms98-a-0021 98.984875 100.720750 um-hum
sw2673B-ms98-a-0022 100.720750 109.794625 [silence]
sw2673B-ms98-a-0023 109.794625 112.182750 uh-huh uh-huh
sw2673B-ms98-a-0024 112.182750 114.480250 so that uh
sw2673B-ms98-a-0025 114.480250 121.991125 definitely it makes a difference my husband was quite a bit older when we married and 
sw2673B-ms98-a-0026 121.991125 125.493375 we decided to you know we wanted to
sw2673B-ms98-a-0027 125.493375 129.262250 to get get our family pretty quick you know and 
sw2673B-ms98-a-0028 129.262250 130.500625 um
sw2673B-ms98-a-0029 130.500625 136.693125 that was you know really a a definitely uh identifying factor you know we began 
sw2673B-ms98-a-0030 136.693125 138.279000 in having a
sw2673B-ms98-a-0031 138.279000 140.463000 [silence]
sw2673B-ms98-a-0032 140.463000 146.030000 well i know that uh here in Dallas we have the unfortunate um
sw2673B-ms98-a-0033 146.030000 147.471875 [silence]
sw2673B-ms98-a-0034 147.471875 152.217625 reputation as being i think it's the fifth
sw2673B-ms98-a-0035 152.217625 157.263750 largest of uh i'm trying to think how that was fifth on the list
sw2673B-ms98-a-0036 157.263750 158.300625 [silence]
sw2673B-ms98-a-0037 158.300625 162.183125 of teenage mothers in the United States
sw2673B-ms98-a-0038 162.183125 170.494000 oh yeah we have i think in nineteen it seems like the statistic was for nineteen eighty eight
sw2673B-ms98-a-0039 170.494000 171.679250 [silence]
sw2673B-ms98-a-0040 171.679250 176.271500 [noise] in Dallas County there were
sw2673B-ms98-a-0041 176.271500 177.483875 [silence]
sw2673B-ms98-a-0042 177.483875 183.439500 i want to say three hundred and fifteen gosh that seems like an awful lot
sw2673B-ms98-a-0043 183.439500 187.738875 of children born to mothers under the age of thirteen
sw2673B-ms98-a-0044 187.738875 199.800250 [silence]
sw2673B-ms98-a-0045 199.800250 209.271625 it can't be education because you know there's more and more family related issues being raised at school
sw2673B-ms98-a-0046 209.271625 211.229125 um
sw2673B-ms98-a-0047 211.229125 221.433875 you know they're lot more progressive more pointed sex education programs all over the country
sw2673B-ms98-a-0048 221.433875 233.460875 [silence]
sw2673B-ms98-a-0049 233.460875 241.480750 one thing that i really see a difference and i guess you know overall uh you know that it's a negative
sw2673B-ms98-a-0050 241.480750 242.472000 [silence]
sw2673B-ms98-a-0051 242.472000 243.771750 is that
sw2673B-ms98-a-0052 243.771750 244.784375 [silence]
sw2673B-ms98-a-0053 244.784375 248.813750 you know these kids and we live in su[burban]- a suburban area
sw2673B-ms98-a-0054 248.813750 250.490125 of Dallas
sw2673B-ms98-a-0055 250.490125 251.495500 [silence]
sw2673B-ms98-a-0056 251.495500 256.778750 these kids do not have the aunts and uncles
sw2673B-ms98-a-0057 256.778750 258.290875 the cousins
sw2673B-ms98-a-0058 258.290875 262.760750 you know that built-in kind of security
sw2673B-ms98-a-0059 262.760750 264.490750 you know
sw2673B-ms98-a-0060 264.490750 265.992000 [silence]
sw2673B-ms98-a-0061 265.992000 268.497125 yeah i think so
sw2673B-ms98-a-0062 268.497125 270.508125 [silence]
sw2673B-ms98-a-0063 270.508125 274.483000 you know of course you have lots and lots of moms working
sw2673B-ms98-a-0064 274.483000 283.994375 [silence]
sw2673B-ms98-a-0065 283.994375 285.279750 that's right
sw2673B-ms98-a-0066 285.279750 290.994750 [silence]
sw2673B-ms98-a-0067 290.994750 292.353250 uh-huh
sw2673B-ms98-a-0068 292.353250 293.316750 [silence]
sw2673B-ms98-a-0069 293.316750 296.489250 so there's kind of a nucleus of cohesion there
sw2673B-ms98-a-0070 296.489250 299.979500 that you could rely on you know if you were ready to just
sw2673B-ms98-a-0071 299.979500 301.271750 you know
sw2673B-ms98-a-0072 301.271750 302.281750 [silence]
sw2673B-ms98-a-0073 302.281750 304.985375 strangle your parents you kind of had
sw2673B-ms98-a-0074 304.985375 313.732125 course there's just a different uh just different feeling as to who who's in control i don't think we ever talked about children's rights
sw2673B-ms98-a-0075 313.732125 320.691875 you know we didn't talk about women's rights [laughter] you know we sure didn't talk about kids' rights [laughter]
sw2673B-ms98-a-0076 320.691875 329.521500 [silence]
sw2673B-ms98-a-0077 329.521500 331.238875 oh yeah
sw2673B-ms98-a-0078 331.238875 339.246375 [silence]
sw2673B-ms98-a-0079 339.246375 343.759125 well you know i can remember as a teenager
sw2673B-ms98-a-0080 343.759125 345.483125 you know we would
sw2673B-ms98-a-0081 345.483125 356.196750 get things fashion wise you know we always c[onsider]- considered Dallas the third coast you know i mean you know feel very uh um
sw2673B-ms98-a-0082 356.196750 365.454375 always felt like we were on the edge of of new trends and you know i had a lot of uh friends and in
sw2673B-ms98-a-0083 365.454375 369.687125 Wyoming and Utah and Colorado because_1 that's where my parents were from
sw2673B-ms98-a-0084 369.687125 380.522125 and we would go there they were always seeing movies that had been here six months before and they were wearing clothes and saying lin[go]- using new lingo that
sw2673B-ms98-a-0085 380.522125 388.468000 we heard way before and so we always felt you know a little you know kind of thumb your nose and
sw2673B-ms98-a-0086 388.468000 398.983375 but now that's not so you know if th[ose]- th[ose]- those parts of the country aren't behind you know they're getting the movies if not you know
sw2673B-ms98-a-0087 398.983375 405.997375 right at the same time they're getting them_1 you know six weeks later it's not you know not so
sw2673B-ms98-a-0088 405.997375 411.248250 and yet i think i think we're really evolving right now i
sw2673B-ms98-a-0089 411.248250 424.289125 you know the seventies and eighties were so uh get all you can cause you may not be here tomorrow and money hungry [laughter] i think we're seeing some comeback to family um
sw2673B-ms98-a-0090 424.289125 427.297375 [silence]
sw2673B-ms98-a-0091 427.297375 430.725375 it's it's a different family unit though
sw2673B-ms98-a-0092 430.725375 435.463500 you know it's not the same that we [laughter] traditionally thought of
sw2673B-ms98-a-0093 435.463500 453.494000 [silence]
sw2673B-ms98-a-0094 453.494000 455.482125 uh-huh uh-huh
sw2673B-ms98-a-0095 455.482125 464.478500 [silence]
sw2673B-ms98-a-0096 464.478500 474.730375 when we uh moved to this particular town this a suburb of Dallas ten years ago there was still a lot
sw2673B-ms98-a-0097 474.730375 485.996250 lot of agri[culture]- of of land that was used for agricultural purposes and that is just you know every year just a little bit more a little bit more slips away
sw2673B-ms98-a-0098 485.996250 494.709000 [silence]
sw2673B-ms98-a-0099 494.709000 497.711000 i don't know um
sw2673B-ms98-a-0100 497.711000 500.697125 [silence]
sw2673B-ms98-a-0101 500.697125 506.988750 i think probably m[ain]- a lot of it was you know contract labor um
sw2673B-ms98-a-0102 506.988750 510.983750 [silence]
sw2673B-ms98-a-0103 510.983750 522.697875 yeah the kids want something more there's a great deal of respect in this area for agriculture and for the foundation that it has given this particular community
sw2673B-ms98-a-0104 522.697875 537.247625 and we still have a couple of very viable families who are you know make large contributions time money you know emotionally to the community and pre[servation]- preservation of its heritage but we don't uh
sw2673B-ms98-a-0105 537.247625 543.985000 you know but but even their concerns are becoming more diversified
sw2673B-ms98-a-0106 543.985000 554.998000 but you know one thing that and this is just totally off the wall but it's another uh another element as we see the encroachment of
sw2673B-ms98-a-0107 554.998000 558.995875 of progress on
sw2673B-ms98-a-0108 558.995875 569.469625 just the ec[osystem]- ecosystem when we moved here and the the fields were mowed every summer we would have this massive influx of crickets
sw2673B-ms98-a-0109 569.469625 577.302500 from the fields into our homes you know just [laughter] i mean crickets so thick you couldn't walk without stepping on them
sw2673B-ms98-a-0110 577.302500 589.436750 and course that then brought different birds that didn't normally come to our area and i don't know what all other effects on the ecosystem because_1 that's not my bailiwick but see we don't have that anymore
sw2673B-ms98-a-0111 589.436750 592.319500 so you wonder what other little
sw2673B-ms98-a-0112 592.319500 595.284125 uh-huh i was reading in uh
sw2673B-ms98-a-0113 595.284125 599.722750 i think it was the Reader's Digest just earlier in the week about
