sw2673A-ms98-a-0041 220.488125 226.743750 right right i grew up in kind of uh there was a rural area and there was nothing but farms and
sw2673A-ms98-a-0042 226.743750 227.747125 [silence]
sw2673A-ms98-a-0043 227.747125 233.756125 mostly mostly dairy and orchards apple orchards and you know peach orchards uh
sw2673A-ms98-a-0044 233.756125 249.930000 [silence]
sw2673A-ms98-a-0045 249.930000 251.446750 yeah

sw2673A-ms98-a-0047 263.729000 267.253625 why because we're a more mobile society
sw2673A-ms98-a-0048 267.253625 271.489000 uh people are just moving out getting jobs and our families on
sw2673A-ms98-a-0049 271.489000 273.490375 [silence]
sw2673A-ms98-a-0050 273.490375 286.294500 that's that's a big problem because at least i- i see that up here when when i was growing up and going to school uh people never locked their doors and uh you know you had family that was
sw2673A-ms98-a-0051 286.294500 291.988625 generally in the area most people kind of stayed put you know very few moved away
sw2673A-ms98-a-0052 291.988625 293.265000 um
sw2673A-ms98-a-0053 293.265000 295.994875 [noise]

sw2673A-ms98-a-0056 299.987750 303.970750 yeah and i think the whole country back then was naive 
sw2673A-ms98-a-0057 303.970750 305.248375 [silence]
sw2673A-ms98-a-0058 305.248375 306.488000 yeah

sw2673A-ms98-a-0060 315.740000 318.812625 yeah right and and
sw2673A-ms98-a-0061 318.812625 332.971250 right children have children have responsibility but i think the the biggest thing now is that uh information is is passed on a lot quicker with with TV and radio and uh
sw2673A-ms98-a-0062 332.971250 339.784500 uh children are under a lot more pressure because from their peers than than it used to be
sw2673A-ms98-a-0063 339.784500 341.484250 um
sw2673A-ms98-a-0064 341.484250 352.482625 [silence]

sw2673A-ms98-a-0082 419.304750 421.785125 yeah i think i
sw2673A-ms98-a-0083 421.785125 424.283250 yeah it's uh
sw2673A-ms98-a-0084 424.283250 426.859250 a family unit yes um

sw2673A-ms98-a-0089 446.494875 454.542625 at least in the east you know my father my grandfather and his father before him always worked at this place so then i would work at this place
sw2673A-ms98-a-0090 454.542625 459.753125 um out in the rural areas we were always farmers or was always going to be farmers
sw2673A-ms98-a-0091 459.753125 464.995750 so you had a lot of children they kind of money didn't seem to be important back then
sw2673A-ms98-a-0092 464.995750 478.976250 [silence]
sw2673A-ms98-a-0093 478.976250 480.752875 so
