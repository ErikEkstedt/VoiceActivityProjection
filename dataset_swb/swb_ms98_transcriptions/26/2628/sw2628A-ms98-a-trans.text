sw2628A-ms98-a-0002 0.499750 3.238625 okay what do you think about it
sw2628A-ms98-a-0003 3.238625 5.849125 [silence]
sw2628A-ms98-a-0004 5.849125 7.476250 oh yeah

sw2628A-ms98-a-0006 13.720125 24.309375 uh-huh yeah i do too i think it's going to in like in the future i think all women are going to work i mean they may let you off for a day or two to have your baby
sw2628A-ms98-a-0007 24.309375 36.947375 but that will be it or either they'll have a computer at home and in the hospital where you can just you know just continue right on with your work i mean i[t]- it really is coming to that because most women
sw2628A-ms98-a-0008 36.947375 47.945750 now days cannot afford the time that they could take off unless the company pays them they can't even afford to take off you know to have children it seems like
sw2628A-ms98-a-0009 47.945750 56.998125 [silence]
sw2628A-ms98-a-0010 56.998125 58.484625 yeah
sw2628A-ms98-a-0011 58.484625 64.253625 [silence]
sw2628A-ms98-a-0012 64.253625 65.751125 right
sw2628A-ms98-a-0013 65.751125 68.211500 [silence]
sw2628A-ms98-a-0014 68.211500 76.996000 now i was real lucky because my husband had a good enough job where when my kids were you know when i had them and when they were small
sw2628A-ms98-a-0015 76.996000 84.496875 until they got in junior high school my youngest one got in junior high i didn't have to work i mean i didn't work i i needed to but i didn't
sw2628A-ms98-a-0016 84.496875 96.457000 [silence]
sw2628A-ms98-a-0017 96.457000 102.489750 [laughter] let me tell you you go without a lot of things that you wou[ld]- you know
sw2628A-ms98-a-0018 102.489750 107.794875 [silence]
sw2628A-ms98-a-0019 107.794875 109.771750 oh yeah
sw2628A-ms98-a-0020 109.771750 118.983750 [silence]
sw2628A-ms98-a-0021 118.983750 129.627125 right right well it's getting where you can't hardly afford if you're going to give your kids any kind of education and stuff you can't hardly afford to have over two
sw2628A-ms98-a-0022 129.627125 142.155750 and i mean it's hard with two now we uh my youngest one i have two i have a son and a daughter and my youngest one is going to be graduating from college soon but if i had a third one
sw2628A-ms98-a-0023 142.155750 144.975500 i just don't know where it would come from
sw2628A-ms98-a-0024 144.975500 153.484625 because i work now i work full time and uh you know it when you put them through college it just takes just about everything you got
sw2628A-ms98-a-0025 153.484625 159.731000 they get loans and grants and scholarships and stuff like that that helps out but still it cost a lot
sw2628A-ms98-a-0026 159.731000 163.997875 [silence]
sw2628A-ms98-a-0027 163.997875 165.490375 right
sw2628A-ms98-a-0028 165.490375 169.785625 and cars and all their books and the books are outrageous
sw2628A-ms98-a-0029 169.785625 173.498000 i mean absolutely outrageous and they're getting worse
sw2628A-ms98-a-0030 173.498000 176.498625 uh my daughter brought home a book the other day
sw2628A-ms98-a-0031 176.498625 191.001625 that she was going to have to have for her one of her next classes and it was like ninety six dollars and this book is a little bitty skinny book i said my goodness what is it lined in gold you know uh but it is it's getting worse and
sw2628A-ms98-a-0032 191.001625 197.705625 if i'd of probably had three or four children i don't see how we could have made it you know without me working
sw2628A-ms98-a-0033 197.705625 207.691875 [silence]
sw2628A-ms98-a-0034 207.691875 221.300125 right but i think i would have had to work if i'd of had that many i'd of had to work in order for my kids to you know even though he brings in a real good living and everything in order for me to keep up i would have had to work
sw2628A-ms98-a-0035 221.300125 230.995125 but i think it's getting more and more like when you have one child now that's it you know then you go to work and you work because
sw2628A-ms98-a-0036 230.995125 243.985250 if you have two or three kids by the [vocalized-noise] way the inflation's going i think a woman's always going to have to work and it's just going to be an accepted thing there isn't going to be any of this you know very few people will ever stay home
sw2628A-ms98-a-0037 243.985250 246.997875 [silence]
sw2628A-ms98-a-0038 246.997875 248.782125 yeah
sw2628A-ms98-a-0039 248.782125 255.985500 [silence]
sw2628A-ms98-a-0040 255.985500 268.623000 well you know i can't imagine how i did because now i work all the time and um well i work all week and um i can't imagine how i stayed home you know i think to myself what did i do
sw2628A-ms98-a-0041 268.623000 276.210750 and i think it just it revolutionized an where a woman thinks that a way you know just like now my daughter
sw2628A-ms98-a-0042 276.210750 289.183375 there's no way that she can imagine herself married at the age that she's at now [noise] to her everything is you've got to go through college you've got to get a job you know and then when everything's set up then you look for
sw2628A-ms98-a-0043 289.183375 301.132500 somebody that you want to spend the rest of your life with but i mean it is so far down the road where now when i graduated high school the thing uh-huh and then you got married and then you had a family
sw2628A-ms98-a-0044 301.132500 308.649375 i mean that's just the way it was you know and uh that's like when my mo[m]- i know when my mother's age it was
sw2628A-ms98-a-0045 308.649375 315.978250 always the kids and the family and everything had to come first and the woman stayed home and took care of them an 
sw2628A-ms98-a-0046 315.978250 317.983875 [silence]
sw2628A-ms98-a-0047 317.983875 319.924250 yeah
sw2628A-ms98-a-0048 319.924250 332.993375 [silence]
sw2628A-ms98-a-0049 332.993375 334.972875 uh-huh
sw2628A-ms98-a-0050 334.972875 354.967625 [silence]
sw2628A-ms98-a-0051 354.967625 356.986375 right
sw2628A-ms98-a-0052 356.986375 360.986625 [silence]
sw2628A-ms98-a-0053 360.986625 367.958000 yeah but you know that now even whenever i was coming up and everything and
sw2628A-ms98-a-0054 367.958000 376.497125 we got married right out of high school well a year after i got out of high school and uh i didn't have kids for four and a half years
sw2628A-ms98-a-0055 376.497125 386.960125 but that was because i wanted to work and i wasn't ready for kids and everybody thought oh my gosh what is the matter with her [laughter-you] [laughter-know]
sw2628A-ms98-a-0056 386.960125 398.298250 right i mean they thought that it was terrible you know and then when i'd tell them you know well i'm just not ready for children yet oh but that you know you better you better just get ready now well you don't just get ready
sw2628A-ms98-a-0057 398.298250 412.672875 but i was kind of odd because as a general rule the people that married during my time they had kids within a year and i just was not ready for kids i wanted to get out and work a little bit and
sw2628A-ms98-a-0058 412.672875 424.999000 i wanted to travel and stuff like that which we did and uh kids didn't fit in right then but it's getting more and more like that where there's more and more couples and really
sw2628A-ms98-a-0059 424.999000 434.498000 if you don't want the kids then it's not the time to have it i don't care what anybody tells you and i think that more and more the attitude's getting that a way
sw2628A-ms98-a-0060 434.498000 440.502500 because that's like my daughter now she says that you know maybe when she's thirty she might want a child then
sw2628A-ms98-a-0061 440.502500 445.491750 and uh even though i'd like to have grandchildren i can see her point
sw2628A-ms98-a-0062 445.491750 452.975375 [silence]
sw2628A-ms98-a-0063 452.975375 454.685875 right
sw2628A-ms98-a-0064 454.685875 460.987125 [silence]
sw2628A-ms98-a-0065 460.987125 463.036625 uh-huh
sw2628A-ms98-a-0066 463.036625 482.690375 [silence]
sw2628A-ms98-a-0067 482.690375 485.246375 um
sw2628A-ms98-a-0068 485.246375 487.247250 yeah
sw2628A-ms98-a-0069 487.247250 492.228250 [silence]
sw2628A-ms98-a-0070 492.228250 497.202625 yeah and it really is i know it [vocalized-noise] just like now you know there's
sw2628A-ms98-a-0071 497.202625 510.997500 there's so much more now all my income goes for things like luxuries i mean it really does except for what we give to my daughter to you know put her through college and stuff but the rest of it we just buy things like
sw2628A-ms98-a-0072 510.997500 515.481625 boats or we go on trips or you know just
sw2628A-ms98-a-0073 515.481625 519.497500 the more or less like entertainment stuff but
sw2628A-ms98-a-0074 519.497500 527.019375 yeah i feel like i have you know because well we're to the age now i'm not old but i'm older
sw2628A-ms98-a-0075 527.019375 540.467875 and uh i got to stay home with my kids which i really wanted to do but now i could not go back and do it i really couldn't i don't think i could stay home all the time and do nothing and i mean i did stuff but
sw2628A-ms98-a-0076 540.467875 547.998000 to me it [laughter] [laughter-feels] [laughter-like] [laughter-i] [laughter-must] have done nothing and i think it's just the new way that people are thinking
sw2628A-ms98-a-0077 547.998000 549.973125 but uh
sw2628A-ms98-a-0078 549.973125 561.725000 [silence]
sw2628A-ms98-a-0079 561.725000 574.437125 well you know more and more of them are i don't know if it is up there where you are but where i am the just like all the hospitals they're getting day care but the reason they had to do this was because so many people
sw2628A-ms98-a-0080 574.437125 582.268000 you know so many women could not afford like you said if you had four kids or even if you had two kids you would be paying
sw2628A-ms98-a-0081 582.268000 594.243375 all your salary to pay for those two kids to go so uh more and more of our hospitals especially over here are getting them and then some of the bigger companies but it's mainly the hospitals
sw2628A-ms98-a-0082 594.243375 595.989750 i don['t]-
sw2628A-ms98-a-0083 595.989750 598.241000 [silence]
sw2628A-ms98-a-0084 598.241000 600.044500 oh really um
