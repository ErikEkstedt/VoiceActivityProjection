sw2636A-ms98-a-0019 79.812375 88.466375 i- i guess the biggest thing that i returned recently was a a a car sea[t]- a baby seat car seat
sw2636A-ms98-a-0020 88.466375 99.701750 that we got um at a store and it was missing a piece there's a a clip that goes with them that uh i guess
sw2636A-ms98-a-0021 99.701750 107.982000 yeah for some seat belts or something you can't connect it without the clip [noise] and it didn't have it so i
sw2636A-ms98-a-0022 107.982000 118.255750 i bought it at one place and i took it back to a different store and and they took it without any problem gave me another one and i opened it up there [laughter] [laughter-to] [laughter-make] [laughter-sure] it was in there before i
sw2636A-ms98-a-0023 118.255750 120.704250 before i took it away
sw2636A-ms98-a-0024 120.704250 125.773875 [silence]
sw2636A-ms98-a-0025 125.773875 131.028250 s[ame]- same type yeah same type of store it was just uh different location
sw2636A-ms98-a-0026 131.028250 135.280625 [silence]
sw2636A-ms98-a-0027 135.280625 136.792375 no
sw2636A-ms98-a-0028 136.792375 141.254875 yeah in fact the way he acted it happened all the time and uh
sw2636A-ms98-a-0029 141.254875 149.293250 my wife was reading in Consumer Reports i think the week later about the car seats and apparently that's a pretty st[andard]- standard practice
sw2636A-ms98-a-0030 149.293250 155.697125 that they only put those clips in in about a third of the boxes because not everybody needs them_1 with the seat belts that they've got
sw2636A-ms98-a-0031 155.697125 159.262750 so they just don't bother to put them_1 in in all of them_1 [laughter]
sw2636A-ms98-a-0032 159.262750 160.512750 [silence]
sw2636A-ms98-a-0033 160.512750 163.225125 so they probably get a lot of that you know

sw2636A-ms98-a-0035 181.244125 187.277750 yeah pr[obably]- yeah i think you're right it's probably hurting hurting that brand not to do that uh

sw2636A-ms98-a-0054 288.472750 300.979125 i- i guess it depends on what you're talking about [laughter] i- i think it de[pends]- and it depends on the company too how seriously they take their their quality control and and
sw2636A-ms98-a-0055 300.979125 310.200625 just customer relations i think companies that think it's important to to have a good product and take care of the customer do a good job on both
sw2636A-ms98-a-0056 310.200625 317.485750 ends you know if there's a complaint they take care of it right away because_1 they don't want any bad PR and they do want return business

sw2636A-ms98-a-0065 374.261375 385.331875 yeah i think probably they're having to change some of their strategies due to survival in a lot of situations uh i think the car industry is a good example of that
