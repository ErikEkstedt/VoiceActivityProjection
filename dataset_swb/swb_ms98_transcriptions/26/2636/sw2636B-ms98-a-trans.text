sw2636B-ms98-a-0002 1.996250 14.737500 well i personally have had something i had to return recently a couple of things um and i didn't have a receipt so i was a little apprehensive heading into it i really was um
sw2636B-ms98-a-0003 14.737500 17.996750 i had a pair of shoes that my daughter had
sw2636B-ms98-a-0004 17.996750 22.805125 you know tried on in the store and she got home and wore them_1 around and [noise]
sw2636B-ms98-a-0005 22.805125 29.237000 she said these just aren't comfortable they hurt [laughter-i] [laughter-said] [laughter-why] [laughter-didn't] [laughter-they] [laughter-hurt] [laughter-in] [laughter-the] [laughter-store]
sw2636B-ms98-a-0006 29.237000 38.203250 [laughter] and thank goodness she hadn't worn them out anywhere you know she hadn't taken them_1 to school or outside and so i took them_1 back and
sw2636B-ms98-a-0007 38.203250 48.959000 they were they were very pleasant about it they c[ould]- you know it was a chain store i don't know if it's appropriate to say a name but you know it wasn't uh department store it was just uh you know
sw2636B-ms98-a-0008 48.959000 55.726875 lower class end of the thing and and they were they were real decent about it but i got the real impression that uh
sw2636B-ms98-a-0009 55.726875 64.469875 if i'd gotten another employee [laughter] i could see her looking over you know if i'd gotten that gal hum-um she would not have
sw2636B-ms98-a-0010 64.469875 68.952500 not have been nearly as polite about me not having a receipt
sw2636B-ms98-a-0011 68.952500 70.014000 [silence]
sw2636B-ms98-a-0012 70.014000 72.705125 but that was a low ticket item
sw2636B-ms98-a-0013 72.705125 77.796875 i i don't think i've ever had to return a higher ticket item
sw2636B-ms98-a-0014 77.796875 80.261750 for a for a long time
sw2636B-ms98-a-0015 80.261750 86.459875 [silence]
sw2636B-ms98-a-0016 86.459875 88.732500 um-hum um-hum
sw2636B-ms98-a-0017 88.732500 97.977125 [silence]
sw2636B-ms98-a-0018 97.977125 101.688000 very important to the safety of the whole thing i'm sure
sw2636B-ms98-a-0019 101.688000 116.730250 [silence]
sw2636B-ms98-a-0020 116.730250 118.790125 uh-huh uh-huh
sw2636B-ms98-a-0021 118.790125 120.226875 [silence]
sw2636B-ms98-a-0022 120.226875 127.781125 now when you say you -[re]tu[rned]- returned it to a different store did you take it just to a different location of the same store or just another
sw2636B-ms98-a-0023 127.781125 129.747750 [silence]
sw2636B-ms98-a-0024 129.747750 137.479500 uh-huh uh-huh but it didn't they didn't say well gee this was only good at did you have your receipt
sw2636B-ms98-a-0025 137.479500 155.624250 [silence]
sw2636B-ms98-a-0026 155.624250 157.034375 so
sw2636B-ms98-a-0027 157.034375 158.444500 [silence]
sw2636B-ms98-a-0028 158.444500 162.277375 huh that's interesting
sw2636B-ms98-a-0029 162.277375 167.313125 well n[ow]- i suppose they you know they save pennies i guess but 
sw2636B-ms98-a-0030 167.313125 175.413250 you know now the question is would you again go buy that same brand would you recommend that brand 
sw2636B-ms98-a-0031 175.413250 181.681000 to somebody or because of the experience would you just say uh don't fool with that brand it 
sw2636B-ms98-a-0032 181.681000 185.438375 [silence] 
sw2636B-ms98-a-0033 185.438375 199.486125 and it probably you know isn't well i think one thing that's kind of a change that i've noticed in the last few years i think the r[eps]- uh manufacturer reps are a lot more on site
sw2636B-ms98-a-0034 199.486125 201.778000 than they used to be
sw2636B-ms98-a-0035 201.778000 203.160375 [silence]
sw2636B-ms98-a-0036 203.160375 214.282500 i think we went through a few you know that was the way it used to be in the old days and then we went through the days when you know maybe only uh one buyer for a whole chain saw
sw2636B-ms98-a-0037 214.282500 225.699000 um a manufacturer's rep and if something was broken or returned to the store or damaged merchandise the store had to eat it more
sw2636B-ms98-a-0038 225.699000 234.272250 and then w[e've]- now we've come you know now it seems like they just send it back you know they have a lot more resources
sw2636B-ms98-a-0039 234.272250 242.700750 you know your your larger stores to re[gain]- regain their money if it comes back you know because_1 sometimes i'll say well
sw2636B-ms98-a-0040 242.700750 256.058500 you know uh this is damaged you know and but it was fixable you know what i'm saying it's something you could bring home and repair and you'd be willing to do that repair if you got price off if you got mark down
sw2636B-ms98-a-0041 256.058500 264.952750 i[tem]- item so that you could afford to go buy the glue or the special thread it was going to take or the patch or whatever you know
sw2636B-ms98-a-0042 264.952750 270.784750 and and say well mark it down and i'll b[uy]- i'll buy it as it is even if it is damaged because it's repairable
sw2636B-ms98-a-0043 270.784750 275.978250 and they won't do it no i can turn this back in and get full credit you know from the you know the rep
sw2636B-ms98-a-0044 275.978250 277.983250 i you know i hear that
sw2636B-ms98-a-0045 277.983250 279.999625 you know where you didn't use to hear that
sw2636B-ms98-a-0046 279.999625 281.001000 [silence]
sw2636B-ms98-a-0047 281.001000 286.775500 but well do you think that overall the uh goods are improving or
sw2636B-ms98-a-0048 286.775500 289.952000 or decreasing in quality
sw2636B-ms98-a-0049 289.952000 297.085125 [silence]
sw2636B-ms98-a-0050 297.085125 298.910250 um-hum um-hum
sw2636B-ms98-a-0051 298.910250 316.478375 [silence]
sw2636B-ms98-a-0052 316.478375 320.988875 i think that American manufacturers are getting a lot more
sw2636B-ms98-a-0053 320.988875 322.497500 um
sw2636B-ms98-a-0054 322.497500 331.489750 pressure to compete in quality than maybe we saw you know ten or twelve fifteen years ago
sw2636B-ms98-a-0055 331.489750 343.523500 that they're they're feeling the heat you know you see a lot of you know now uh you know the ads that come out they'll say you know ninety percent of our products you know made in the USA
sw2636B-ms98-a-0056 343.523500 350.184875 you know that kind of thing we buy we buy American so you can too you know kind of slogans
sw2636B-ms98-a-0057 350.184875 356.483875 but uh so it must be a heightened you know awareness that way the uh
sw2636B-ms98-a-0058 356.483875 358.468250 um
sw2636B-ms98-a-0059 358.468250 362.199750 one thing i've uh well i jus[t]-
sw2636B-ms98-a-0060 362.199750 363.985000 [silence]
sw2636B-ms98-a-0061 363.985000 371.955875 i don't know how to say that [laughter-cohesively] [laughter-so] [laughter-i'll] [laughter-pass] [laughter-on] [laughter-that] [laughter-thought] [laughter-until] [laughter-it] [laughter-comes] [laughter-back] in my head clearer
sw2636B-ms98-a-0062 371.955875 378.489000 [silence]
sw2636B-ms98-a-0063 378.489000 380.985500 um-hum um-hum
sw2636B-ms98-a-0064 380.985500 384.710375 [silence]
sw2636B-ms98-a-0065 384.710375 387.484875 oh certainly
sw2636B-ms98-a-0066 387.484875 394.691875 you know they uh Lee Iacocca [laughter-you] [laughter-know] made a major [laughter] uh
sw2636B-ms98-a-0067 394.691875 403.942625 plea you know i mean his just his advertising strategy with Chrysler you know has i think really made a lot of people rethink
sw2636B-ms98-a-0068 403.942625 408.999375 are we being patriotic if we don't buy
sw2636B-ms98-a-0069 408.999375 422.699500 we uh uh i have a Girl Scout troop not now but we did in the couple of years ago we uh we did an international kind of merit badge activity and one of the things we did is we
sw2636B-ms98-a-0070 422.699500 433.734875 had everybody bring from home at least five things from that had been purchased or you know not purchased but made in other countries
sw2636B-ms98-a-0071 433.734875 447.747125 i was surprised i thought these girls you know won't be able to come up with that many different things we had so many countries represented it just it was really an eye opener for me far more probably [laughter-than] [laughter-it] [laughter-was] [laughter-for] [laughter-them] but
sw2636B-ms98-a-0072 447.747125 451.996625 it really uh really surprised me just to see the
sw2636B-ms98-a-0073 451.996625 453.993125 the difference
sw2636B-ms98-a-0074 453.993125 460.995875 you know and just a wide variety wide wide variety and i thought we might be seeing things that
sw2636B-ms98-a-0075 460.995875 474.945625 oh you know had come down from their family or grandfather and grandma went on a safari or [noise] you know went to Europe or something like that but it wasn't it was just everyday kinds of things that you go to Skaggs or Target and buy you know that came from
sw2636B-ms98-a-0076 474.945625 477.332375 you know Poland or China
sw2636B-ms98-a-0077 477.332375 491.970125 you know Finland or you know just really you know Kenya lots of different everyday kinds of you know items useful items lots of different foods showed up that we commonly purchase and don't even think about you know that they aren't
sw2636B-ms98-a-0078 491.970125 493.976500 stateside grown
sw2636B-ms98-a-0079 493.976500 497.983375 [silence]
sw2636B-ms98-a-0080 497.983375 501.177000 yeah [laughter] yeah bet you um-hum
sw2636B-ms98-a-0081 501.177000 503.969375 yeah exactly
sw2636B-ms98-a-0082 503.969375 509.983875 i think uh one thing that's kind of uh uh th[inking]- thinking about quality
sw2636B-ms98-a-0083 509.983875 518.967000 that we see differences now like are in the new homes you know homes that are being built they have so many more amenities
sw2636B-ms98-a-0084 518.967000 528.489750 offered that our forefathers wouldn't have even crossed their brains to have expected you know a dishwasher or a disposal or uh uh
sw2636B-ms98-a-0085 528.489750 536.779000 track lighting or garage door opener you know those ki[nds]- the fancy bathrooms and stuff and yet the sturdiness of them_1
sw2636B-ms98-a-0086 536.779000 541.764875 doesn't a[lways]- al[ways]- doesn't always
sw2636B-ms98-a-0087 541.764875 543.707875 measure up
sw2636B-ms98-a-0088 543.707875 547.488125 [silence]
sw2636B-ms98-a-0089 547.488125 551.721125 and yet they have to put those things in because they're expected
sw2636B-ms98-a-0090 551.721125 557.253625 you know even young couples buying a home they've lived in apartments that
sw2636B-ms98-a-0091 557.253625 560.961500 provide those things so they just assume they'll be in a home
sw2636B-ms98-a-0092 560.961500 563.453875 all they expect to
sw2636B-ms98-a-0093 563.453875 565.663125 you know to be able to
sw2636B-ms98-a-0094 565.663125 567.485625 [silence]
sw2636B-ms98-a-0095 567.485625 575.256625 i[t]- it just wouldn't dawn on them to not have a microwave built [laughter-in] [laughter-in] [laughter-a] [laughter-new] [laughter-home] and that kind of thing and yet we probably
sw2636B-ms98-a-0096 575.256625 580.499250 you know we pay for it in other ways by not you know basic structure
sw2636B-ms98-a-0097 580.499250 588.959000 and yet technology is still keeping up with the times too well i think i think we're probably going to see a lot of changes in the next
sw2636B-ms98-a-0098 588.959000 595.263750 five years or so i think there's technology out there right now that's just
sw2636B-ms98-a-0099 595.263750 599.979750 on the v[ery]- on the very very edge
