sw2638A-ms98-a-0003 6.640875 7.906750 i mean basically
sw2638A-ms98-a-0004 7.906750 10.082375 okay

sw2638A-ms98-a-0013 46.393750 50.792750 right as a matter of fact i want to think they took the top managers first isn't that a fact
sw2638A-ms98-a-0014 50.792750 58.851500 i've been retired from TI about a year but the program you know was still fairly new i guess it had been going on maybe almost a year
sw2638A-ms98-a-0015 58.851500 68.847750 before i retired so i was not uh ever called upon to do a drug test i certainly wouldn't object to it and i think random is probably you know the only really fair way to do it

sw2638A-ms98-a-0024 105.621000 111.887875 especially if they have anything do with you know government contracts or anything as matter of fact i want to believe that the uh
sw2638A-ms98-a-0025 111.887875 125.094375 defense department more or less mandated that people you know who work on defense contracts you know s[ome]- do some sort of you know drug testing i think that's really what maybe prompted TI to do it i was in the uh
sw2638A-ms98-a-0026 125.094375 136.784625 Defense Electronic Division when i retired i know it was a you know it was a real hot hot item there i think i want to think maybe they you know really got some nudging from you know D O D to do this sort of thing

sw2638A-ms98-a-0033 171.319250 178.149500 it's to m[uch]- as far as i know it's you know seems to be a fairly accurate program as far as uh you know the testing goes
