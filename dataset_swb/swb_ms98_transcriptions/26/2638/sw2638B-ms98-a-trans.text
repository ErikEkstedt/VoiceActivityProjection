sw2638B-ms98-a-0006 13.154875 20.163500 yeah i i uh uh the policy that TI has i think is uh uh very fair
sw2638B-ms98-a-0007 20.163500 22.866500 um i
sw2638B-ms98-a-0008 22.866500 35.758750 they first had a policy where they uh would test new employees and then since i've been with them the last four years uh there's been in the last year year and a half um they're doing random testing of all employees
sw2638B-ms98-a-0009 35.758750 38.404125 [silence]
sw2638B-ms98-a-0010 38.404125 39.486375 yes

sw2638B-ms98-a-0012 42.493375 47.196500 and it is it and fr[om]- from what i understand it is Jerry Junkins all the way down
sw2638B-ms98-a-0013 47.196500 53.121000 [silence]
sw2638B-ms98-a-0014 53.121000 54.343375 uh-huh

sw2638B-ms98-a-0018 68.570500 78.371625 yeah um i like it because um you know i i i grew up in the sixties i mean i graduated high school in sixty eight and
sw2638B-ms98-a-0019 78.371625 91.758875 and uh you know i i saw you know i know my friends who were you know druggies and friends who weren't and and uh you know it's i think it's a real problem
sw2638B-ms98-a-0020 91.758875 97.112750 and i think it and i think it's causing us a lot of trouble and and a lot of problems
sw2638B-ms98-a-0021 97.112750 103.026500 and so i'm hoping that uh a lot of other companies will will follow the same path
sw2638B-ms98-a-0022 103.026500 104.424125 [silence]
sw2638B-ms98-a-0023 104.424125 106.275625 um probably not

sw2638B-ms98-a-0027 136.592000 139.229250 yeah i used to be in DSEG myself
sw2638B-ms98-a-0028 139.229250 141.676375 um A P D as a matter of fact
sw2638B-ms98-a-0029 141.676375 142.828500 [silence]
sw2638B-ms98-a-0030 142.828500 143.932875 yep
sw2638B-ms98-a-0031 143.932875 157.966125 very aware of it but i i'd i'd i really like the idea uh in fact i would like to see uh a lot more uh people uh adopt it uh like you know school systems and that kind of thing
sw2638B-ms98-a-0032 157.966125 163.523750 i mean i'd like i'd like to know that my child's being taught by a teacher who's not on drugs or
sw2638B-ms98-a-0033 163.523750 167.248250 or uh who might be at a point where they're trying to sell my kid drugs
sw2638B-ms98-a-0034 167.248250 171.062125 [silence]
sw2638B-ms98-a-0035 171.062125 172.155375 yeah
sw2638B-ms98-a-0036 172.155375 179.092250 [silence]
sw2638B-ms98-a-0037 179.092250 189.600000 and i like the idea that they have a uh system where they allow you to uh be retested if for some reason there may have been a problem or something did show up
sw2638B-ms98-a-0038 189.600000 191.674250 [silence]
sw2638B-ms98-a-0039 191.674250 193.537625 yeah yeah
sw2638B-ms98-a-0040 193.537625 195.913875 yeah rather than just uh
sw2638B-ms98-a-0041 195.913875 198.898625 put you out on the street and let you fend for yourself
sw2638B-ms98-a-0042 198.898625 204.752875 that's not going to help anybody get over the problem i believe it is a a a medical problem
sw2638B-ms98-a-0043 204.752875 209.948625 um of course i also think smoking is the most addictive thing in the world too [laughter]
sw2638B-ms98-a-0044 209.948625 211.816625 [silence]
sw2638B-ms98-a-0045 211.816625 214.119625 yeah so i mean there's a lot of things out there and
sw2638B-ms98-a-0046 214.119625 215.765125 things that uh
sw2638B-ms98-a-0047 215.765125 225.941125 i'm just glad that they uh decided not to uh tax drugs otherwise they'd be legal and they'd be getting tax money off it the same way they are the alcohol and [laughter-tobacco] [laughter]
sw2638B-ms98-a-0048 225.941125 230.849750 [silence]
sw2638B-ms98-a-0049 230.849750 231.918750 yeah
sw2638B-ms98-a-0050 231.918750 246.706625 i have friends that work in other companies that are just now adopting the policy and and stuff and i uh uh i moved to a TI facility that um had never had uh random drug sampling before
sw2638B-ms98-a-0051 246.706625 257.835125 because they were outside of the military sector it was uh an industrial company and uh you know that TI purchased and so the people here a lot of them are real opposed to it 
sw2638B-ms98-a-0052 257.835125 266.117125 uh they were really opposed to it and you know there was a few of them that obviously were doing drugs and that's why they were opposed to it
sw2638B-ms98-a-0053 266.117125 269.628250 and uh it resulted in in a few people leaving
sw2638B-ms98-a-0054 269.628250 272.697125 you know because they just flat out weren't going to put up with the policy
sw2638B-ms98-a-0055 272.697125 275.261875 you know they had a lifestyle and they weren't going to change it
sw2638B-ms98-a-0056 275.261875 276.563375 and it's
sw2638B-ms98-a-0057 276.563375 292.732625 [silence]
sw2638B-ms98-a-0058 292.732625 293.832625 yeah
sw2638B-ms98-a-0059 293.832625 306.211875 i mean uh you should have no objection to it it's like uh going down to get your license and checking your eyes i mean you know why do i need my eyes checked well we want to make sure you can see [laughter] 
sw2638B-ms98-a-0060 306.211875 309.709625 why are we doing this well so you don't kill people on the road
sw2638B-ms98-a-0061 309.709625 313.410375 uh it's a ba[sic]- [laughter] i mean it's the basic premise with you know drug testing
sw2638B-ms98-a-0062 313.410375 315.606125 especially some of the jobs um
sw2638B-ms98-a-0063 315.606125 329.230250 luckily i've always been in the engineering sector and it's very little that anyone could do in the engineering sector as far as uh you know hurting someone i mean it's hard to imagine somebody misusing a computer and somebody dying from it
sw2638B-ms98-a-0064 329.230250 335.481500 but uh in the manufacturing sectors and over in semiconductor and down in some of those labs and stuff
sw2638B-ms98-a-0065 335.481500 343.370500 yeah i darn if i'd want somebody down there that i'm working with side by side you know that could kill me
sw2638B-ms98-a-0066 343.370500 346.799125 by doing something incorrectly because they were
sw2638B-ms98-a-0067 346.799125 350.283875 not exactly all there because they were on drugs
sw2638B-ms98-a-0068 350.283875 358.601125 so there's a there's a lot of sectors where i think that would would help out and i think in the long run we all benefit
sw2638B-ms98-a-0069 358.601125 361.394375 i mean if you have uh
sw2638B-ms98-a-0070 361.394375 372.011375 you know if you're not working with someone on drugs well then you're going to have less accidents and you have less accidents and you spend less money on medical and you spend less money on medical then the company's more profitable
sw2638B-ms98-a-0071 372.011375 379.580125 well then the company's more profitable then maybe they can pay you more if they can pay you more you can buy more and then and it and it goes around you know to everywhere
sw2638B-ms98-a-0072 379.580125 381.518000 yep all over
sw2638B-ms98-a-0073 381.518000 383.197500 and uh
sw2638B-ms98-a-0074 383.197500 385.318375 it certainly does and
sw2638B-ms98-a-0075 385.318375 391.648625 i i just hope that uh more and more companies uh get on the ball and and start it up
sw2638B-ms98-a-0076 391.648625 398.608250 [silence]
sw2638B-ms98-a-0077 398.608250 406.594875 well a lot of companies are are coming down in price and i think that the insurance companies are starting to give uh benefits
sw2638B-ms98-a-0078 406.594875 410.875750 you know re[duction]- reduction in in medical costs if you know they
sw2638B-ms98-a-0079 410.875750 416.236875 yeah so i think everybody will will benefit from the program
sw2638B-ms98-a-0080 416.236875 421.759000 and i think if if a lot more insurance companies get on the bandwagon and say well if you impose uh
sw2638B-ms98-a-0081 421.759000 432.697500 mandatory drug testing we'll reduce your insurance costs by you know twenty per cent and of course you know the company's not going to reduce the employee's cost of insurance twenty per cent they're going to reduce their own
sw2638B-ms98-a-0082 432.697500 437.684250 yeah and that'll cover it and maybe some insurance companies might start offering it as a uh
sw2638B-ms98-a-0083 437.684250 440.092000 as part of the package
sw2638B-ms98-a-0084 440.092000 443.922250 [silence]
sw2638B-ms98-a-0085 443.922250 446.413625 yeah so it i i think
sw2638B-ms98-a-0086 446.413625 450.240875 i think all around it it's going to help out a lot course
sw2638B-ms98-a-0087 450.240875 452.265750 [silence]
sw2638B-ms98-a-0088 452.265750 453.494000 yeah
sw2638B-ms98-a-0089 453.494000 454.895500 [silence]
sw2638B-ms98-a-0090 454.895500 456.598125 it was great talking with you
sw2638B-ms98-a-0091 456.598125 457.983750 you do the same
sw2638B-ms98-a-0092 457.983750 459.050375 bye-bye
