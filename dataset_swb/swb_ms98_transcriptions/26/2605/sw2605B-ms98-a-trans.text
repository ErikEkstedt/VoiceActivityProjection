sw2605B-ms98-a-0019 64.069250 68.523250 [silence]
sw2605B-ms98-a-0020 68.523250 69.359750 sure
sw2605B-ms98-a-0021 69.359750 77.694875 [silence]
sw2605B-ms98-a-0022 77.694875 79.108375 yeah yeah
sw2605B-ms98-a-0023 79.108375 83.784125 [silence]

sw2605B-ms98-a-0025 85.146250 88.412250 [silence]
sw2605B-ms98-a-0026 88.412250 98.255125 yeah the last the last big camping trip i was on was uh probably a few years after that but it was in the Pagosa Springs area in Colorado a bunch of us uh from here went up there and uh
sw2605B-ms98-a-0027 98.255125 106.483125 now i got hit by the same thing because we thought we were going to be real mountain men and uh we got up there and we had the little pills you're supposed to put in the water and make sure that it's potable
sw2605B-ms98-a-0028 106.483125 117.017625 and of course we're up you know up above you know fourteen thousand feet or whatever and we said we[ll]- well how dirty could the water be right you nev[er]- never think about bacteria or amoeba or anything like that
sw2605B-ms98-a-0029 117.017625 123.141375 you think well nobody's using the bathroom farther up stream so it's got to be all right so we were doing things like uh
sw2605B-ms98-a-0030 123.141375 135.875625 you know we all had our little collapsible cups and we were going up to where the water was coming over rocks and all that and we'd just kind of stick our cups in there and drink and then we were there for five or six days and an[d]- it was neat you know we saw deer and uh
sw2605B-ms98-a-0031 135.875625 146.200000 had to put our uh food up in the in the trees and all that i was the unlucky guy that got up every morning and said well i guess i might as well {putz} around here while everyone else is sleeping so i was usually the guy who had to get it out of the tree and all that
sw2605B-ms98-a-0032 146.200000 150.662375 [silence]
sw2605B-ms98-a-0033 150.662375 152.597250 yeah
sw2605B-ms98-a-0034 152.597250 160.335250 [silence]
sw2605B-ms98-a-0035 160.335250 161.714750 right
sw2605B-ms98-a-0036 161.714750 164.664125 [silence]
sw2605B-ms98-a-0037 164.664125 166.139500 that's [laughter-right]
sw2605B-ms98-a-0038 166.139500 167.739500 [silence]
sw2605B-ms98-a-0039 167.739500 174.787500 that's that's right you don't want to be the first one up and have to put the fire on and have to ta[ke]- take care of everything while everyone else is sacked out
sw2605B-ms98-a-0040 174.787500 182.374000 and then if they wake up and you haven't done everything it's like why haven't you done that but uh well we were drinking you know back to that uh water thing and of course i got sick
sw2605B-ms98-a-0041 182.374000 187.870750 about the second or third -[un]til the end of the day i'm i'm uproariously sick and i'm in the tent sweating it out
sw2605B-ms98-a-0042 187.870750 195.849750 and the two guys i was with they were like well this you're a wimp you know because we've been drinking out of the water and we're okay so they went out fly fishing and they're having a great time
sw2605B-ms98-a-0043 195.849750 205.376750 and and just all the way back to Dallas i'm just uproariously sick and uh we get back here and of course the first day back at work i go to work and where are these guys
sw2605B-ms98-a-0044 205.376750 216.248500 and they were off both off a week sick because they were just it's just like it took them a little longer to hit it hit and it hit them and they were just like calling into work going oh i'm miserable i'm i'm just
sw2605B-ms98-a-0045 216.248500 221.471875 i can't keep anything down i'm and i just cramps and i'm just going hey tell me about it right
sw2605B-ms98-a-0046 221.471875 230.300625 and uh but uh that was probably the last big camp that's probably the last big camping trip i've i've gone on i haven't gone in a few years on anything real big
sw2605B-ms98-a-0047 230.300625 235.257500 uh no no but i know somebody who does and that's how i got into this so but uh
sw2605B-ms98-a-0048 235.257500 245.030625 but in fact it's funny that's this was the topic because i was just reading Outside Magazine here this morning and uh and that some big issue on the only way to camp about about canoe camping
sw2605B-ms98-a-0049 245.030625 254.219375 and uh and i've i've done a lot of canoeing but never have camped out over night and and they makes a lot make a lot of good points about at least with a canoe you don't have to carry everything
sw2605B-ms98-a-0050 254.219375 262.976875 you can throw big tents and food and and stoves and everything in and all you have to do is just you don't even have to if you go downstream you hardly even have to paddle and it's uh
sw2605B-ms98-a-0051 262.976875 274.327250 well that's true too as long as you're not going to going to hit any white water or you know if you're just doing a nice calm river it's uh it it's it uh you don't have to put very much effort into it 
sw2605B-ms98-a-0052 274.327250 278.655625 and uh boys i guess as i get older that'll get more and [laughter-more] appetizing
sw2605B-ms98-a-0053 278.655625 280.376625 the truck and
sw2605B-ms98-a-0054 280.376625 281.831375 [silence]
sw2605B-ms98-a-0055 281.831375 283.918750 that's that's right
sw2605B-ms98-a-0056 283.918750 293.331125 and uh and if we're lucky we'll talk somebody into taking the car downstream and we'll just throw the canoe in there and uh and uh tell you what we'll just we'll just float downstream and uh that's that's
sw2605B-ms98-a-0057 293.331125 296.455750 that's about as tough as nope that's
sw2605B-ms98-a-0058 296.455750 302.689000 just keep us off a rock and we'll just let the let the stream take us down river and all that but uh
sw2605B-ms98-a-0059 302.689000 310.360250 but uh but uh well you over there in Ca[rolina]- North Carolina you probably get a lot of chance to you've got a lot of rivers and a lot of uh white white water over there i think
sw2605B-ms98-a-0060 310.360250 312.378875 [silence]
sw2605B-ms98-a-0061 312.378875 313.565625 uh-huh
sw2605B-ms98-a-0062 313.565625 315.217375 [silence]
sw2605B-ms98-a-0063 315.217375 315.996875 yeah
sw2605B-ms98-a-0064 315.996875 320.443375 [silence]
sw2605B-ms98-a-0065 320.443375 321.458625 uh-huh
sw2605B-ms98-a-0066 321.458625 324.508875 [silence]
sw2605B-ms98-a-0067 324.508875 328.712875 yeah yeah that's probably true because uh that's
sw2605B-ms98-a-0068 328.712875 336.773250 that's true you can't even uh because i know uh even i and my wife would probably uh have a hard time sitting in sitting out in the woods for a couple of days
sw2605B-ms98-a-0069 336.773250 346.209500 and uh you've really got to be careful who you go out there with and that they're out they're out for what they're doing and you're out for what you want to do and then you all get get to do what you want to do i guess while you're out there but uh
sw2605B-ms98-a-0070 346.209500 350.857125 well well all right bye-bye
sw2605B-ms98-a-0071 350.857125 352.061875 [noise]
