sw2650A-ms98-a-0002 0.488000 3.739875 okay this is really ironic that this would
sw2650A-ms98-a-0003 3.739875 9.333500 i would get this subject today because just yesterday our [laughter-dog] ran away [laughter] and it's just
sw2650A-ms98-a-0004 9.333500 19.331875 been tearing me up all [laughter-day] [laughter] because_1 we have just been looking all over for him we've been to the pound we've been to the humane society we've been to the adoption
sw2650A-ms98-a-0005 19.331875 27.462875 center we've just been all over the neighborhood we've been calling [laughter-neighbors] so this is just really strange [laughter] that
sw2650A-ms98-a-0006 27.462875 41.988875 no this is the first time um he's gotten out before but he's always stayed right here you know he's never gone away and so this is just really strange you know because um
sw2650A-ms98-a-0007 41.988875 53.692375 he's part golden lab and part uh let's see Alaskan no not Alaskan i always forget [laughter] uh Australian shepherd
sw2650A-ms98-a-0008 53.692375 60.288125 and yeah he's pretty big that's why i[t]- it really surprises me you know that
sw2650A-ms98-a-0009 60.288125 67.278625 he hasn't come back because like i said he's never gone away like this before and
sw2650A-ms98-a-0010 67.278625 78.773250 i would think you know he might i mean he might could get hurt by a car or something i don't know that he could really get killed that easily because_1 he is so big you know but i don't know [laughter]
sw2650A-ms98-a-0011 78.773250 82.315625 thanks i do too [laughter] [vocalized-noise]
sw2650A-ms98-a-0012 82.315625 90.525750 oh about two years so he's yeah it's really gosh [laughter] [vocalized-noise]
sw2650A-ms98-a-0013 90.525750 95.487875 that isn't that funny how we do i mean we just really
sw2650A-ms98-a-0014 95.487875 96.987375 [silence]

sw2650A-ms98-a-0023 149.985375 160.038250 oh yeah that's what are so neat about animals i mean they are you know like i said they're they're really companions you know and they're friends you know i mean they
sw2650A-ms98-a-0024 160.038250 170.231750 you can love them_1 all you want and they love you right back and they [laughter-don't] yeah no [laughter] i know it's just so neat you know it's
sw2650A-ms98-a-0025 170.231750 181.671875 that's i don't know [laughter] this is just so hard [laughter] [vocalized-noise] it's just like i said we've had him for two years and he's never i mean he's he's gotten out
sw2650A-ms98-a-0026 181.671875 193.451875 but he's always been right there he's never been gone from at all you know he's just always been right there when he gets out you know it's the first time he's ever been gone like [laughter-this]
sw2650A-ms98-a-0027 193.451875 201.195625 uh i i just knew today uh you know we looked at the pound and
sw2650A-ms98-a-0028 201.195625 210.394875 and that we just went all over the place and i knew we were going to find him you know and when we didn't it was like oh no [laughter] so i don't know
sw2650A-ms98-a-0029 210.394875 212.982500 [silence]
sw2650A-ms98-a-0030 212.982500 222.495000 yeah we keep you know they they told us like at the Humane Society and the adoption center you know don't give up hope you know and then
sw2650A-ms98-a-0031 222.495000 231.229625 well not yet we were talking about that tonight since you know he we just he just got out yesterday we were just talking about that whether we
sw2650A-ms98-a-0032 231.229625 235.678000 we were trying to find some pictures of him recently we've got so many when he was a puppy
sw2650A-ms98-a-0033 235.678000 247.997000 you [laughter-know] but we just don't have a whole lot we have him on film you know on the video camera [laughter] you [laughter-know] but you can't put that on the [laughter] you know [laughter-so]
sw2650A-ms98-a-0034 247.997000 254.492625 so i don't know i we will probably will put some things up some posters and stuff up
sw2650A-ms98-a-0035 254.492625 264.499500 and hopefully that will help you know and maybe around the neighborhood but we know a lot of people that live in this neighborhood so that helps too you know if they can keep yeah
sw2650A-ms98-a-0036 264.499500 277.997250 so i think that if somebody else picks him up i think that uh if he gets out he'll come back you know i really do because he knows exactly where he lives so
sw2650A-ms98-a-0037 277.997250 281.455750 nope
sw2650A-ms98-a-0038 281.455750 294.772750 [noise] i know it's just like i said it's just so ironic that this would happen [laughter-you] [laughter-know] and i would get [laughter-this] this kind of a call [laughter] yeah it just i know it's really strange but
sw2650A-ms98-a-0039 294.772750 309.203000 [silence]
sw2650A-ms98-a-0040 309.203000 323.705250 well that's good that's one thing about cats though they're so small and you know they can get hurt a lot easier you know and then so that would make you really tend to [laughter-worry] about [laughter-them_1] you know if they're not right there
sw2650A-ms98-a-0041 323.705250 328.214625 [silence]
sw2650A-ms98-a-0042 328.214625 330.182500 is that right
sw2650A-ms98-a-0043 330.182500 353.712375 [silence]
sw2650A-ms98-a-0044 353.712375 367.700250 huh that's really i i guess i really don't know cats that well because my mother never liked them so i never had them_1 growing up so you know i never really had them_1 around me you know so i've never owned one [laughter] you know but
sw2650A-ms98-a-0045 367.700250 378.955875 [silence]

sw2650A-ms98-a-0050 397.502500 402.620875 yeah that's [laughter-true] i i like the way they come up and they'll
sw2650A-ms98-a-0051 402.620875 414.948125 they'll put their head underneath your hand [laughter-you] [laughter-know] [laughter-it's] that uh and most dogs do that i mean i don't know any that really don't i mean you know they know exactly how to get that attention you know they just
sw2650A-ms98-a-0052 414.948125 423.491625 you know come up and they put your you know [laughter] or they'll rub their their head against you you [laughter-know] [laughter-and] [laughter-it's] it's
sw2650A-ms98-a-0053 423.491625 430.681250 well no well well he's outside during the day and then when we get home at night we do bring him in
sw2650A-ms98-a-0054 430.681250 441.471625 ye[ah]- uh-huh yeah the backyard it's real big too for him to run in and stuff that's why we couldn't understand why he would want to get out [laughter] [laughter-you] [laughter-know] because_1 he got all this room to run in and
sw2650A-ms98-a-0055 441.471625 442.719875 but
sw2650A-ms98-a-0056 442.719875 452.961625 he dug a hole under the fence well see he did he did it a couple weeks ago dug a hole and you know we we filled it back up
sw2650A-ms98-a-0057 452.961625 464.413750 put him back in there he did it again [laughter] so we chained him up you know but we really didn't want to keep him chained up because_1 you know we feel like that's just too restricting for him so um
sw2650A-ms98-a-0058 464.413750 470.171625 we got we we put dirt in the hole and then put some chicken wire around it
sw2650A-ms98-a-0059 470.171625 477.986250 you know so that he couldn't get out well he kind of ripped through the chicken [laughter-wire] so i can't i i i just have not
sw2650A-ms98-a-0060 477.986250 490.803750 i don't understand you know because_1 it's like uh he's got a good home you know he's got i mean we have two kids you know that just love him a lot you [laughter-know] it's like we can't understand why he kept wanting to get out you know we just couldn't
sw2650A-ms98-a-0061 490.803750 493.753250 [silence]
sw2650A-ms98-a-0062 493.753250 508.194000 yeah i guess that's yeah i guess that's probably true i don't think it's anything we did [laughter] least i would hope [laughter-not] no i i know i mean he's always you know he really does have a good home i think that's what really
sw2650A-ms98-a-0063 508.194000 511.986250 bothers me the most [laughter-about] [laughter-it] you know it's like
sw2650A-ms98-a-0064 511.986250 513.805125 well
sw2650A-ms98-a-0065 513.805125 522.430375 i don't know if it's really quite hit him hit them [laughter] uh i have two girls and they they just been real um
sw2650A-ms98-a-0066 522.430375 527.715875 i don't know at first you know they seemed to be upset but now it's like um
sw2650A-ms98-a-0067 527.715875 535.499625 well if he doesn't come home can we get another [laughter-dog] it's like wait a [laughter-minute] you [laughter-know]
