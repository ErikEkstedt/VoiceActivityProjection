sw2623B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 3.739125 [noise]
sw2623B-ms98-a-0002 3.739125 7.485875 [noise] okay i uh i have five children all together 
sw2623B-ms98-a-0003 7.485875 16.979625 uh my oldest two are already out and about in the world and i uh have a set of twins that are fourteen and uh my youngest is twelve
sw2623B-ms98-a-0004 16.979625 18.698750 [silence]
sw2623B-ms98-a-0005 18.698750 23.019625 uh yeah if you like doing everything twice
sw2623B-ms98-a-0006 23.019625 25.498500 uh at any rate um
sw2623B-ms98-a-0007 25.498500 28.493000 my first two children uh
sw2623B-ms98-a-0008 28.493000 31.241000 i didn't spend a whole lot of time with them
sw2623B-ms98-a-0009 31.241000 45.739500 um and you know was a a problem with having five children needing to work a uh full-time job that was more than a full-time job i worked about fifty one hours a week because i worked every worked eleven hours every Sunday
sw2623B-ms98-a-0010 45.739500 53.487125 and uh so i didn't get to spend as much time with them as i as i should have as i really wanted to
sw2623B-ms98-a-0011 53.487125 61.492000 yeah the yeah the f[amily]- well it was with all of them but it was uh more an impact i think on the oldest two
sw2623B-ms98-a-0012 61.492000 63.496125 because um
sw2623B-ms98-a-0013 63.496125 66.284125 oh about the time i got out of working
sw2623B-ms98-a-0014 66.284125 74.319500 that long hours was when the uh when the twins were about three years old and uh they never you know i don't think they
sw2623B-ms98-a-0015 74.319500 82.449750 noticed i wasn't around that much you know with all the children around the house it's kind of hard to notice that dad isn't around very much [noise] um 
sw2623B-ms98-a-0016 82.449750 86.464625 so what i've tried to do uh now
sw2623B-ms98-a-0017 86.464625 93.013500 that i've uh fi[nally]- went back to school and got my degree when i was thirty years old and uh so
sw2623B-ms98-a-0018 93.013500 106.976500 then i came out and was making as much money forty hours a week as i did fifty one hours a week so i've tried to spend more time with uh the children since then um what i'm currently doing is uh taking a lot of time um
sw2623B-ms98-a-0019 106.976500 119.522500 helping the kids more with their homework in the evenings um we just started a thing where every other week we go to uh movies there's a movie theater that offers dollar movies on Wednesday nights
sw2623B-ms98-a-0020 119.522500 124.754000 and so every couple of weeks we will go to the movies because that's how often they change the movies and
sw2623B-ms98-a-0021 124.754000 137.491750 it's working out pretty well um we're spending more time together i feel like i'm a lot closer to the three that are still living at home than i ever was to the two that were living there before um
sw2623B-ms98-a-0022 137.491750 149.726375 and in fact i found that i'm a lot closer with uh i have one son who's gone and i don't even know where he's at um he's taken off for parts unknown but uh yeah a[nd]- and uh my
sw2623B-ms98-a-0023 149.726375 152.214875 daughter is um
sw2623B-ms98-a-0024 152.214875 158.997500 has moved out of the house her and i get along a lot better now that she's [laughter-moved] [laughter-out] [laughter-of] [laughter-the] [laughter-house] [laughter] 
sw2623B-ms98-a-0025 158.997500 160.740250 [laughter]
sw2623B-ms98-a-0026 160.740250 163.972000 and uh so it's it's it's
sw2623B-ms98-a-0027 163.972000 175.810875 it's been difficult to try to find the time and i think it's important that we do because um i notice that uh when i had spent two years down in Dallas down there they all have a uh
sw2623B-ms98-a-0028 175.810875 177.674500 a me kind of attitude
sw2623B-ms98-a-0029 177.674500 187.688000 and i noticed parents not spending time with their children and and going out and doing things and you know i knew like the kids next door were all into cocaine and
sw2623B-ms98-a-0030 187.688000 192.692250 you know it just you know i saw the family falling apart down there
sw2623B-ms98-a-0031 192.692250 198.252250 [silence]
sw2623B-ms98-a-0032 198.252250 210.224375 yeah and so i think it's kind of important that i that i you know nurture the relationship i have with my children now and i'm doing my best to keep that up
sw2623B-ms98-a-0033 210.224375 211.268500 [silence]
sw2623B-ms98-a-0034 211.268500 213.491500 yeah what's your been your experience

sw2623B-ms98-a-0038 223.994875 236.239375 she just recently started working uh she worked a job until we moved to our new house and uh she quit that job because it was too inconvenient and uh she starts a new job tomorrow which should take her out of the house about four days a week
sw2623B-ms98-a-0039 236.239375 243.998750 [silence]

sw2623B-ms98-a-0054 332.997375 340.991500 yeah that sounds great i've i've noticed uh another thing um [noise] oh when i was younger my father was always working and 
sw2623B-ms98-a-0055 340.991500 351.725500 yeah and uh you know he uh he worked a full-time job and a part-time job and i never saw him so i didn't have much of a role model to go by
sw2623B-ms98-a-0056 351.725500 355.300750 you know to learn how to be a a father and a parent
sw2623B-ms98-a-0057 355.300750 362.249750 and that kind of thing because i i can't ever remember playing ball with my dad or catch with my dad or doing anything with my dad
sw2623B-ms98-a-0058 362.249750 363.485375 [silence]
sw2623B-ms98-a-0059 363.485375 375.222625 yeah and it if you don't have i don't i it's my feeling that if you don't have a role model to follow then it's kind of tough you know everybody's not Father Knows Best
sw2623B-ms98-a-0060 375.222625 376.665125 yeah but
sw2623B-ms98-a-0061 376.665125 377.860375 [silence]

sw2623B-ms98-a-0066 385.379000 396.980000 yeah i mean the the the capability to uh create children doesn't necessarily mean you have the uh the mental capacity to raise them [laughter] and

sw2623B-ms98-a-0072 461.493000 466.173375 even if even if someone's home all the time there's still a lot of things that have to be done

sw2623B-ms98-a-0082 500.994125 502.491000 [silence]
sw2623B-ms98-a-0083 502.491000 516.306500 yes i i felt that it certainly was i mean i was smarter than most of the people that i was working for and uh you know every time something new came up i was explaining it to them and uh i had
sw2623B-ms98-a-0084 516.306500 519.474875 [laughter] yeah i uh
