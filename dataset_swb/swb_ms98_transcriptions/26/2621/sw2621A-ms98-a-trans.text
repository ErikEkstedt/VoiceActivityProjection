sw2621A-ms98-a-0002 1.286375 5.493875 but a lot of women are are knowl[edge]- as knowledgeable about pro football as i am 
sw2621A-ms98-a-0003 5.493875 12.788625 can i guess your favorite team if you had one might be the Steelers well i can understand that i you know i kind of like the Cowboys too
sw2621A-ms98-a-0004 12.788625 15.996875 they've had some great games in the past
sw2621A-ms98-a-0005 15.996875 19.986000 [silence]
sw2621A-ms98-a-0006 19.986000 22.042125 uh-huh me too
sw2621A-ms98-a-0007 22.042125 28.825750 it wasn't nearly as much fun when Bradshaw was playing for you guys i'll tell [laughter-you] he lives in the Dallas area now as a matter of fact
sw2621A-ms98-a-0008 28.825750 37.495375 well actually it's probably closer to Fort Worth but it's it's in the same area he bought uh bought a big horse farm out in a little town called Roanoke Texas
sw2621A-ms98-a-0009 37.495375 47.714875 but he pops up on the Dallas scene quite often as a matter of fact there was some talk about trying to get him involved with the team management in some sort of a coaching job
sw2621A-ms98-a-0010 47.714875 58.793750 i don't know he'd be good at it he's such a motivator he he primarily you know with the quarterbacks that would be his specialty i wished i wished they could work something i really like him i really do
sw2621A-ms98-a-0011 58.793750 60.484875 [silence]
sw2621A-ms98-a-0012 60.484875 65.488500 yeah okay i'd love to see Dallas and Houston play in a Super Bowl that would be really great
sw2621A-ms98-a-0013 65.488500 74.205750 that may not ever happen i don't know uh Houston has had some wonderful talent you know down through the years and in the earlier years they really had some super teams
sw2621A-ms98-a-0014 74.205750 75.481125 that's right
sw2621A-ms98-a-0015 75.481125 76.494625 [silence]
sw2621A-ms98-a-0016 76.494625 78.639750 he certainly is he's very good
sw2621A-ms98-a-0017 78.639750 80.304000 he's very good
sw2621A-ms98-a-0018 80.304000 82.477500 [silence]
sw2621A-ms98-a-0019 82.477500 89.248000 that's right Randall Cunningham was with Philadelphia i guess last year but he's no longer with the team
sw2621A-ms98-a-0020 89.248000 97.261375 so you're right there are very few black quarterbacks or at least that are starting anyway how do you think the Steelers are going to do this year you have any idea
sw2621A-ms98-a-0021 97.261375 102.242500 [silence]

sw2621A-ms98-a-0028 117.498625 122.493750 well that's a tough it would be tough to do it really would they have such a super team for years
sw2621A-ms98-a-0029 122.493750 125.241875 that won what four Super Bowls
sw2621A-ms98-a-0030 125.241875 129.499625 four in a row i don't know if that could ever be duplicated again or not

sw2621A-ms98-a-0040 148.591875 150.763125 they had such a super team

sw2621A-ms98-a-0044 158.737250 169.275500 there's quite a bit of activity now of course they had so many you know nice uh choices [laughter-because] their record was so lousy the last few years they picked up you know quiet a few
sw2621A-ms98-a-0045 169.275500 180.960000 of the of course you never know the guys they pick you know m[ay]- may never play a game you jus[t]- never know it's it's a gamble it really is they may get hurt or not be able to participate at that level if you know
sw2621A-ms98-a-0046 180.960000 184.724000 [silence]
sw2621A-ms98-a-0047 184.724000 186.387375 ever been
sw2621A-ms98-a-0048 186.387375 195.736750 probably an old guy that played probably before you were born [laughter] his name was Sam Huff he used to play for the New York Giants
sw2621A-ms98-a-0049 195.736750 209.285375 that was one of the toughest guys that i've ever seen in my life as far as you know dedication he just went all out every single play of course there have been some other great ones too Dick Butkis and Bradshaw you know there's been so many
sw2621A-ms98-a-0050 209.285375 212.747125 but if i had to pick one i would probably pick Sam Huff as a matter of fact

sw2621A-ms98-a-0078 290.484750 294.482125 yeah well they make mistakes too i guess [laughter]
sw2621A-ms98-a-0079 294.482125 296.765250 absolutely
sw2621A-ms98-a-0080 296.765250 298.488375 absolutely

sw2621A-ms98-a-0085 306.491625 314.974750 absolutely i don't know how they do it it's it must just take a hundred percent concentration i guess because they know they're going to get hit it's just a matter of how hard you know or where
sw2621A-ms98-a-0086 314.974750 317.285875 [silence]
sw2621A-ms98-a-0087 317.285875 326.733875 oh absolutely they look like sometimes they're just broken in two like a match stem gosh what a beating they really do take a beating they really do
sw2621A-ms98-a-0088 326.733875 331.762375 [silence]
sw2621A-ms98-a-0089 331.762375 338.671375 i think he was just probably a passing phenomena i [laughter-think] i don't know i i'm
sw2621A-ms98-a-0090 338.671375 353.159375 knowing what you know of course Mike Ditka was in Dallas for years and years as coach is knowing his or you know knowing of his temperament i'm just surprised he ever you know kept the guy around i really am he's such a he's about a half hot head anyway such a temper
sw2621A-ms98-a-0091 353.159375 354.974875 [silence]
sw2621A-ms98-a-0092 354.974875 357.243875 uh-huh
sw2621A-ms98-a-0093 357.243875 370.222625 that's right yeah absolutely there's just so much mass there i guess they just can't i don't know you know i probably the guy is you know is probably physically strong i you know obviously not very fast but i guess it's just
sw2621A-ms98-a-0094 370.222625 379.541500 like you say a mass that nobody can seem t[o]- to get out of the way as far as him scoring touch downs you know i think that was kind of weird [laughter] i don't know
sw2621A-ms98-a-0095 379.541500 388.996000 Dallas has a guy uh his name is Nate Newton now he has a real weight problem too he fights it every single year but he manages to still keep playing but
sw2621A-ms98-a-0096 388.996000 391.978000 he has a terrible weight problem
sw2621A-ms98-a-0097 391.978000 400.310625 they wa[tch]- the coaches watch him all year long they they weigh him several times a year just to make sure he's not you know completely out of control
sw2621A-ms98-a-0098 400.310625 404.994750 but i guess most every team has so[me]- has someone like that i don't know
sw2621A-ms98-a-0099 404.994750 406.234625 [silence]
sw2621A-ms98-a-0100 406.234625 411.763375 absolutely they get bigger and bigger it seems every year i guess you have to to
sw2621A-ms98-a-0101 411.763375 415.468125 you know [vocalized-noise] to stay in the game i guess yeah
sw2621A-ms98-a-0102 415.468125 426.495750 [silence]
sw2621A-ms98-a-0103 426.495750 434.491875 oh yeah sure well you'd have to uh or i would have to say you know someone like Montana i guess who's done so well for so many years
sw2621A-ms98-a-0104 434.491875 435.991125 [silence]
sw2621A-ms98-a-0105 435.991125 439.302875 yeah his age is about to catch up with him though
sw2621A-ms98-a-0106 439.302875 449.515500 he's no Spring chicken anymore and like you say Warren Moon's an excellent Warren Moon's an excellent but he's very exciting to watch uh-huh sure uh-huh absolutely
sw2621A-ms98-a-0107 449.515500 451.702625 [silence]
sw2621A-ms98-a-0108 451.702625 458.984625 uh i'm obviously he's a very good quarterback i'd i never was you know too a whole lot of a big fan you know [vocalized-noise]
sw2621A-ms98-a-0109 458.984625 460.998875 yeah he may uh-huh
sw2621A-ms98-a-0110 460.998875 462.759875 [silence]
sw2621A-ms98-a-0111 462.759875 466.978375 yes he was i believe that's right at one point in time ye[ah]- but he's a very young fellow yeah
sw2621A-ms98-a-0112 466.978375 481.442000 of course a quarterback can look so good if he's got a lot of you know if he's got a good supporting cast you know [laughter] if not he gets beat to death like poor old Troy Aikman has the last couple of years anyway you know we[ll]- Dallas did better last year hopefully they'll do better this year
sw2621A-ms98-a-0113 481.442000 492.514750 [silence]
sw2621A-ms98-a-0114 492.514750 494.206000 uh-huh
sw2621A-ms98-a-0115 494.206000 496.328000 [silence]
sw2621A-ms98-a-0116 496.328000 500.513750 that's right that's right yeah Miami's had some down years too
sw2621A-ms98-a-0117 500.513750 505.689000 but they all do i guess it's it's cyclical i guess as the players get older
sw2621A-ms98-a-0118 505.689000 507.641000 get slower
sw2621A-ms98-a-0119 507.641000 508.846125 [laughter]
sw2621A-ms98-a-0120 508.846125 509.994125 yeah
sw2621A-ms98-a-0121 509.994125 511.830750 oh yeah
sw2621A-ms98-a-0122 511.830750 520.976000 oh yes very much so hip injuries and things like that yeah yeah that that forces a lot of the guys to get out of the game
sw2621A-ms98-a-0123 520.976000 528.955125 that's right uh-huh yeah i read some time well not too long ago that the average
sw2621A-ms98-a-0124 528.955125 537.477125 uh professional career only lasts seven years so that's when you think about it that's really not a very long time of course
sw2621A-ms98-a-0125 537.477125 544.265250 yeah but if the average is seven years that means a lot of guys don't make it seven years you know
sw2621A-ms98-a-0126 544.265250 547.978000 that's right yeah that's right yeah
sw2621A-ms98-a-0127 547.978000 552.753000 that's that's a pretty short career on average
sw2621A-ms98-a-0128 552.753000 560.750250 of course they play their you know cards right and do some good investments they'll you know they'll do all right but a lot of them don't unfortunately
sw2621A-ms98-a-0129 560.750250 566.738000 [silence]
sw2621A-ms98-a-0130 566.738000 573.752000 yeah they they're always branded you know as a bunch of outlaws [laughter] if their if their
sw2621A-ms98-a-0131 573.752000 582.329750 you know arrest record won't let able won't let them play anywhere else they seem to go to [laughter-they] [laughter-seem] to go to the Raiders but that just may be you know perceived
sw2621A-ms98-a-0132 582.329750 590.260125 you know perception i don't know Al Davis is he's a kind of strange character strange strange looking guy apparently he's
sw2621A-ms98-a-0133 590.260125 599.861250 kind of a wild guy i don't really know for sure they've had some excellent teams though obviously they i'm not sure they've yet decided where they want to play they keeping talk about you know going
