sw2647B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 42.951375 [silence]
sw2647B-ms98-a-0002 42.951375 53.998625 that's interesting i went to a smaller school [noise] of probably three thousand thirty five hundred and i i- i thought that was the best experience in that
sw2647B-ms98-a-0003 53.998625 62.978125 we had more one-on-one [vocalized-noise] since we seemed to know everyone on campus and we had a broad spectrum of languages and cultures and 
sw2647B-ms98-a-0004 62.978125 71.987875 and backgrounds and so forth so i thought it was wonderful to be a bigger fish and not so much a number um
sw2647B-ms98-a-0005 71.987875 83.899375 one of fifty thousand i was one of three thousand and and you know different perspectives i uh but it sounds like we were both kind of looking at the same sort of sort of thing
sw2647B-ms98-a-0006 83.899375 92.979625 [silence]
sw2647B-ms98-a-0007 92.979625 94.663875 yeah
sw2647B-ms98-a-0008 94.663875 118.715625 [silence]
sw2647B-ms98-a-0009 118.715625 120.993500 uh-huh yeah
sw2647B-ms98-a-0010 120.993500 122.492625 [silence]
sw2647B-ms98-a-0011 122.492625 125.976750 that's one thing to definitely consider
sw2647B-ms98-a-0012 125.976750 155.969125 [silence]
sw2647B-ms98-a-0013 155.969125 157.974875 uh-huh
sw2647B-ms98-a-0014 157.974875 165.167375 [silence]
sw2647B-ms98-a-0015 165.167375 166.743375 yeah
sw2647B-ms98-a-0016 166.743375 170.794750 [silence]
sw2647B-ms98-a-0017 170.794750 178.688625 i think that's probably key to me is not so much the size of the school but what what are the particular needs of
sw2647B-ms98-a-0018 178.688625 192.272750 the students and whereas some would immediately feel very comfortable in this um larger university setting some of the students um when i was when i was teaching school
sw2647B-ms98-a-0019 192.272750 197.490875 would not have been comfortable with that they needed uh a[t]- at least at first
sw2647B-ms98-a-0020 197.490875 207.960625 they needed a smaller setting that that was more like family where they could get one-on-one from from teachers professors and so forth and then after a year or two move on to
sw2647B-ms98-a-0021 207.960625 217.918125 a little bit bigger pond where where when they had a little more self-confidence built up oh yes i can do this oh i've done this before it's just in a bigger setting and so maybe to me
sw2647B-ms98-a-0022 217.918125 231.054125 the key would be wh[at]- what are what are the chi[ld's]- the the student's needs and what what school or schools can best meet those those needs besides education y[ou]- y[ou]- you can expect
sw2647B-ms98-a-0023 231.054125 238.301375 all of them with uh uh accredita[tion]- accreditation to give the education 
sw2647B-ms98-a-0024 238.301375 247.480125 but it's these other things that you and i are are keying off on that that are really more of an education that but they're the things that don't show up in
sw2647B-ms98-a-0025 247.480125 249.988125 that's right that's right
sw2647B-ms98-a-0026 249.988125 263.470000 [silence]
sw2647B-ms98-a-0027 263.470000 265.194500 right
sw2647B-ms98-a-0028 265.194500 282.496125 [silence]
sw2647B-ms98-a-0029 282.496125 285.980000 um
sw2647B-ms98-a-0030 285.980000 289.469000 [silence]
sw2647B-ms98-a-0031 289.469000 290.984625 yeah
sw2647B-ms98-a-0032 290.984625 300.701625 [silence]
sw2647B-ms98-a-0033 300.701625 302.993500 um-hum
sw2647B-ms98-a-0034 302.993500 304.706250 yeah
sw2647B-ms98-a-0035 304.706250 312.693500 [silence]
sw2647B-ms98-a-0036 312.693500 326.258875 i guess i guess now i've been out for i i'm i'm older than you i've been out for twenty one years and i was looking at an annual last night uh something had s[parked]- it sparked a question and i went to a
sw2647B-ms98-a-0037 326.258875 334.836625 small private school um and it was church related [laughter-and] [laughter-i] got to looking at my class of sixty nine
sw2647B-ms98-a-0038 334.836625 343.616625 and i realized that even though that school's two hundred miles from here and i've lived in other states and done other things for the past twenty years
sw2647B-ms98-a-0039 343.616625 356.496000 where i go to church now there are five other people that went to school at the same time in the same class as i and it it's neat to know that we have that contact that goes back that some of the same
sw2647B-ms98-a-0040 356.496000 360.482375 memories if not the same
sw2647B-ms98-a-0041 360.482375 373.252875 e[ducation]- education in uh you know w[e]- we weren't all out to be teachers or or whatever so we didn't have the same classes but we had a common thread something that still ties us together twenty odd years later 
sw2647B-ms98-a-0042 373.252875 378.791125 and it's it's it's kind of neat just knowing that those kinds of things
sw2647B-ms98-a-0043 378.791125 385.489000 those are what i carry beyond just that piece of paper that allows me to be an exempt at TI
sw2647B-ms98-a-0044 385.489000 388.981250 i have something more important to me than that
sw2647B-ms98-a-0045 388.981250 398.000375 [silence]
sw2647B-ms98-a-0046 398.000375 399.999250 uh-huh
sw2647B-ms98-a-0047 399.999250 408.935750 [silence]
sw2647B-ms98-a-0048 408.935750 411.199125 uh-huh
sw2647B-ms98-a-0049 411.199125 417.671750 [silence]
sw2647B-ms98-a-0050 417.671750 419.459625 uh-huh
sw2647B-ms98-a-0051 419.459625 435.972875 [silence]
sw2647B-ms98-a-0052 435.972875 438.979750 uh-huh
sw2647B-ms98-a-0053 438.979750 441.251250 [silence]
sw2647B-ms98-a-0054 441.251250 445.733000 i was going to ask who won [laughter]
sw2647B-ms98-a-0055 445.733000 449.833625 [silence]
sw2647B-ms98-a-0056 449.833625 464.725500 in in that case uh regardless of what you or your father pushed for it sounds like she was going for what she needed and finding a school that that met her specific requirements and and made the best fit for her
sw2647B-ms98-a-0057 464.725500 471.970250 [silence]
sw2647B-ms98-a-0058 471.970250 473.683000 yeah
sw2647B-ms98-a-0059 473.683000 478.991750 [silence]
sw2647B-ms98-a-0060 478.991750 493.036500 i think it helps uh uh now my grandfather was going to pay if i went to uh what's now UT Arlington because it was there in my hometown i could live at home but i chose to go to another school
sw2647B-ms98-a-0061 493.036500 507.443000 and even though he was pleased that it was a church related school he was not willing to pay any at all even the same amount of money a[nd]- and i think i value my my education more because i had to work for it
sw2647B-ms98-a-0062 507.443000 516.268250 and because i knew all along that's what i wanted ev[en]- even though i had to buck the family in order to to do what i needed to do
sw2647B-ms98-a-0063 516.268250 528.494875 so um i- i guess i guess it was it was my mother's support that got me through it that and ten years of of uh loans [laughter] [laughter-after] i got [laughter-out] [laughter]
sw2647B-ms98-a-0064 528.494875 529.503500 [silence]
sw2647B-ms98-a-0065 529.503500 533.994500 sounds familiar huh your it's very fresh in your memory
sw2647B-ms98-a-0066 533.994500 534.994875 w[ell]-
sw2647B-ms98-a-0067 534.994875 536.999875 uh yeah
sw2647B-ms98-a-0068 536.999875 541.490250 yes well sorry about that Tanya [laughter]
sw2647B-ms98-a-0069 541.490250 544.488875 i'm sure it was worth it though 
sw2647B-ms98-a-0070 544.488875 550.693625 if if nothing else because_1 i work in training at TI now if nothing else just
sw2647B-ms98-a-0071 550.693625 560.983875 those experiences beyond and and including your educational classes that help give you the self-esteem to do and achieve whatever you set your mind on
sw2647B-ms98-a-0072 560.983875 571.972500 and the you you made the right choice in going to a school that met all of your needs to make [vocalized-noise] to give you the the potential to do whatever you wanted 
sw2647B-ms98-a-0073 571.972500 588.741875 [silence]
sw2647B-ms98-a-0074 588.741875 594.993500 young lady you have gotten your education then that's that's right
sw2647B-ms98-a-0075 594.993500 596.741500 [silence]
