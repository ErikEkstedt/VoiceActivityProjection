sw2647A-ms98-a-0003 3.260000 11.757500 i guess i'll start um [noise] one uh big thing that the advise that i would give to a parent to give to his or her child is 
sw2647A-ms98-a-0004 11.757500 15.499250 to let their let their child experience college
sw2647A-ms98-a-0005 15.499250 26.624875 in a kind of general sense i like large colleges because i went to University of Texas at Austin they have fifty thousand students there and i feel like that now if i went
sw2647A-ms98-a-0006 26.624875 35.975375 if i had gone to a small college that only had a couple of thousand that i wouldn't have have gotten as much exposure to different people and different uh
sw2647A-ms98-a-0007 35.975375 42.988250 i don't know different languages different cultures and things like that just by being around those fifty thousand students

sw2647A-ms98-a-0023 80.997500 95.726750 y[eah]- yeah i i could see i could see that point i could see how it would be i'm sure your classes were a lot smaller um because_1 like we would have biology classes that did main courses that everyone has to take i mean hundreds of students in this class so actually yes you were a number
sw2647A-ms98-a-0024 95.726750 100.249750 but um i i just i don't know i'm thinking in a sense of uh
sw2647A-ms98-a-0025 100.249750 103.469375 just being exposed to more
sw2647A-ms98-a-0026 103.469375 115.482625 it just seems like in a larger college you i don't know you're exposed to so many more people from all over the world and i'm sure a lot of people come to you know small colleges also but just that they're more
sw2647A-ms98-a-0027 115.482625 124.265750 of of the different cultures there not that it not that it's better but i'm just saying that i think that [vocalized-noise] big 
sw2647A-ms98-a-0028 124.265750 135.997125 uh-huh uh-huh i think uh a lot of a lot of students now would probably be afraid of a smaller college a lot of the students that i talked to even here in Waco they go to Baylor um
sw2647A-ms98-a-0029 135.997125 142.399500 they or [vocalized-noise] they're considering going to Baylor they're also considering going to UT Austin but one of the big 
sw2647A-ms98-a-0030 142.399500 153.313875 no no is because of the fifty thousand students and i have to tell them that just like W[aco]- just like i live in Waco it's a large city i can still function in my own kind of 
sw2647A-ms98-a-0031 153.313875 162.174625 area in my own group i have a job i have my friends and i'm really not as as concerned about the entire city so when you go to a big
sw2647A-ms98-a-0032 162.174625 171.802000 a big university you're not as concerned about the entire university but your group of friends your classes your interests your clubs and things like that

sw2647A-ms98-a-0054 246.760875 258.752250 on paper um-hum exactly that's that's one important thing that i think about school i'm i'm not a kind a person that i didn't i i was kind of a B student i guess you'd say and i didn't really
sw2647A-ms98-a-0055 258.752250 267.297500 i was [vocalized-noise] i s[trived]- strived to be an A student but it wasn't like a real priority to my my priority was just
sw2647A-ms98-a-0056 267.297500 281.195500 being as worldly as i could possibly [laughter-be] getting into as many organizations as i c[ould]- possibly could and and one other point i was going to make was that i can un[derstand]- i can see that probably if i had gone to a smaller school i would probably have 
sw2647A-ms98-a-0057 281.195500 282.988375 more friends
sw2647A-ms98-a-0058 282.988375 286.985500 because you like you said you know
sw2647A-ms98-a-0059 286.985500 295.969875 you know everybody knows everybody and so you probably come out of it knowing and by friends i mean like contacts for when you get out of school
sw2647A-ms98-a-0060 295.969875 307.650875 um you know you just you may walk into a company and see someone you went to school with more so at a small college then a large college you may have gone to school with them but you wouldn't you wouldn't know them_1 uh
sw2647A-ms98-a-0061 307.650875 312.807750 i guess let me think of another important thing to look at when you look into college

sw2647A-ms98-a-0088 387.996875 400.254000 that's great that's great yeah that's what i that's basically what i and when i first i've been out of college only two years [laughter-now] so it's still pretty fresh on my memory um 
sw2647A-ms98-a-0089 400.254000 404.968750 but now that i'm out when i went into school my parents told
sw2647A-ms98-a-0090 404.968750 414.997000 well my f[ather]- okay let me let me go back to my my sister now is is in college and my father was really interested in getting her in a school that
sw2647A-ms98-a-0091 414.997000 423.238375 would look good on her on her uh diploma etcetera and so forth and and i kept pushing her towards
sw2647A-ms98-a-0092 423.238375 428.303625 just kind of U UT or a larger school 
sw2647A-ms98-a-0093 428.303625 435.713750 and it was just a big conflict between us because my father wanted the academics and i wanted her to get
sw2647A-ms98-a-0094 435.713750 446.494000 the life experience out of it and so it was you know she went the academic way because she's a straight A student which is y[eah]- yeah yeah so she you know that's probably
sw2647A-ms98-a-0095 446.494000 451.469750 you know what she what she wants anyway but that was the big deal and
sw2647A-ms98-a-0096 451.469750 456.783250 [silence]
sw2647A-ms98-a-0097 456.783250 458.483500 right

sw2647A-ms98-a-0101 463.997875 469.251625 and that that's another point is that the a parent should tell their child to be
sw2647A-ms98-a-0102 469.251625 481.290750 or or to give their child the leeway to choose their school not so much choose the school for them but you know kind of guide them along but let them more or less choose what they need and what they're going to do
