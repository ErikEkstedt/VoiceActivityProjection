sw2606A-ms98-a-0012 22.832250 26.982750 [silence]
sw2606A-ms98-a-0013 26.982750 28.086125 oh okay
sw2606A-ms98-a-0014 28.086125 30.045750 [silence]

sw2606A-ms98-a-0016 31.139125 31.631250 [silence]

sw2606A-ms98-a-0018 33.101375 36.427625 [silence]
sw2606A-ms98-a-0019 36.427625 38.419500 well i imagine they're just starting
sw2606A-ms98-a-0020 38.419500 39.623625 [silence]
sw2606A-ms98-a-0021 39.623625 51.579375 do you you know what's exciting about wa[tching]- i never watched minor league teams until i came to Texas because i was raised one near Boston following the Red Sox and then i went to graduate school in Pittsburgh so i became a Pirate fan
sw2606A-ms98-a-0022 51.579375 62.785500 and i was never in a minor league city until i came Dall[as]- we were a minor league city when i came here in fifty nine and i immediately bought season tickets uh to the class triple A uh uh Dallas Rangers
sw2606A-ms98-a-0023 62.785500 69.326750 and then the class uh double A Dallas Fort Worth Spurs we later uh they went to the Texas league
sw2606A-ms98-a-0024 69.326750 79.390000 and uh i just really enjoy it i guess i enjoy watching guys when they were very first starting out playing here and then seeing them a year or two later as as stars in the majors
sw2606A-ms98-a-0025 79.390000 90.431375 uh and i- i think that's probably the fun of watching minor league baseball and the other thing is watching guys on the other end uh guys that i had seen play for both the Red Sox and Pittsburgh
sw2606A-ms98-a-0026 90.431375 103.029750 uh they get to the other end of their career and now they come up and talk to you between [laughter-innings] of [laughter-games] i- i think that was exciting too uh have you seen any minor leaguers come through uh any guys come through Raleigh that are now in the big time
sw2606A-ms98-a-0027 103.029750 104.885750 [silence]
sw2606A-ms98-a-0028 104.885750 109.635250 not yet okay well of course you're at the class A level you're a few years away from that
sw2606A-ms98-a-0029 109.635250 110.982125 [silence]
sw2606A-ms98-a-0030 110.982125 113.137875 uh hang on a second Rick i got to see who that is
sw2606A-ms98-a-0031 113.137875 126.650250 [silence]

sw2606A-ms98-a-0033 127.587500 127.950625 [silence]
sw2606A-ms98-a-0034 127.950625 131.928875 yeah uh uh do you follow any major league teams at all
sw2606A-ms98-a-0035 131.928875 132.930000 uh which ones
sw2606A-ms98-a-0036 132.930000 134.761750 [silence]
sw2606A-ms98-a-0037 134.761750 138.053000 oh okay okay well how do you think they're going to do this year
sw2606A-ms98-a-0038 138.053000 140.200625 [silence]
sw2606A-ms98-a-0039 140.200625 142.960375 fair huh
sw2606A-ms98-a-0040 142.960375 144.651000 yeah yeah
sw2606A-ms98-a-0041 144.651000 145.153500 [silence]
sw2606A-ms98-a-0042 145.153500 149.095125 well i think the Phillies picked up some good players in the free agent market didn't they
sw2606A-ms98-a-0043 149.095125 149.808750 [silence]
sw2606A-ms98-a-0044 149.808750 156.425250 and and the Dodgers i guess what surprised me most about the Dodgers was letting uh Valenzuela go
sw2606A-ms98-a-0045 156.425250 159.858125 [silence]
sw2606A-ms98-a-0046 159.858125 167.677250 yeah i think they probably did he prob[ably]- i was reading the other day that what may have happened to him is he pitched too many innings too young
sw2606A-ms98-a-0047 167.677250 176.324625 they say that if a guy's pitching that that his arm is still developing until he's twenty five and if he pitches a whole lot of innings before that it may take its toll later in life
sw2606A-ms98-a-0048 176.324625 182.800000 of course i've been watching Nolan Ryan this afternoon and uh [laughter] it doesn't seem to bother him
sw2606A-ms98-a-0049 182.800000 188.380875 uh he he has to be an outstanding physical specimen to to do what he's done
sw2606A-ms98-a-0050 188.380875 191.288125 uh well Palmer tried a comeback
sw2606A-ms98-a-0051 191.288125 203.767500 and uh got sore arm early and they uh the Rangers are playing Baltimore this game that i'm watching and just the last inning they put the camera over on he and Brooks Robinson they are the broadcast team for the Orioles now
sw2606A-ms98-a-0052 203.767500 214.281625 and app[arently]- apparently his uh his come back just didn't make it and that he got he got hurt early in the uh in the uh uh in the spring training uh
sw2606A-ms98-a-0053 214.281625 220.199125 oh the the Dodgers the Dodgers have got an interesting thing they've got this uh rookie pitcher what's it Martinez his name
sw2606A-ms98-a-0054 220.199125 233.276750 that uh that pitched a bunch of innings last year as a nineteen or twenty year o[ld]- year old and they were using what happened to Valenzuela as an example that they should be careful and not over work him this early of course i was really uh
sw2606A-ms98-a-0055 233.276750 242.703875 uh a Dodger fan a couple of years ago when they won the Wor[ld]- World Series and Hershiser won all those games in the World Series that was that was really a
sw2606A-ms98-a-0056 242.703875 249.928375 uh yeah the year they beat the As i was really and boy i can still remember that Kirk Gibson home run
sw2606A-ms98-a-0057 249.928375 263.755250 yeah they were because everybody thought the As were the greatest things in the world and uh we've got we're the only ones around here that got cable and that particular game was some reason or another was on a cable channel and uh my son's in high school and all his friends were here
sw2606A-ms98-a-0058 263.755250 276.471750 we're all sitting around we must have had ten people in our living room watching it gosh gosh everybody just erupted when that happened and uh that was uh uh strictly an outstanding game uh the uh
sw2606A-ms98-a-0059 276.471750 288.975625 uh the Dodgers the Phillies i'm not uh you know the National League we have an American League team here so i don't get that much into the National League stuff here i see them on the game of the week occasionally and i haven't seen the the Phillies
sw2606A-ms98-a-0060 288.975625 296.842000 that much i know that Mike Smith retiring a couple of years ago left a big hole offensively who do the Phillies look to to drive in a lot of runs
sw2606A-ms98-a-0061 296.842000 301.628000 [silence]
sw2606A-ms98-a-0062 301.628000 302.927250 well who do they
sw2606A-ms98-a-0063 302.927250 306.676750 of course you know Mike Marshall was the big guy the year that uh
sw2606A-ms98-a-0064 306.676750 312.223625 uh they won the World Series and Kirk Gibson Who who are are the Dodgers big RBI guys now
sw2606A-ms98-a-0065 312.223625 317.007250 [silence]
sw2606A-ms98-a-0066 317.007250 320.719375 yeah well i'm a i'm a Texas Ranger fan
sw2606A-ms98-a-0067 320.719375 329.287625 and uh you you know they are O and four but i think they're going to be one and four at the end of today they're sitting here with two out in the ninth with a uh fifteen to three lead
sw2606A-ms98-a-0068 329.287625 342.589500 that looks that that was fairly comfortable yeah and it was why and Nolan Ryan pitched the first seven innings today and he gave up three runs in the first inning and i said oh my God here we go again you know you know with two outs walk walk home run bang we're down three to nothing
sw2606A-ms98-a-0069 342.589500 346.050625 but they got four in their half of the first and then Nolan was invincible
sw2606A-ms98-a-0070 346.050625 359.965125 he went out after the seventh and had he had only give up those uh that one hit in the first inning and another hit so he went out after the seventh inning with a uh at the time he had a uh i think uh a nine to three ten to three lead and uh
sw2606A-ms98-a-0071 359.965125 371.505625 uh he had only given up two hits and uh two walks and nine strike outs so he's he's back in the groove and a a guy his age this this afternoon here it's about seventy nine degrees
sw2606A-ms98-a-0072 371.505625 374.484500 a little bit humid clear blue sky and the sunshine
sw2606A-ms98-a-0073 374.484500 378.500875 and the Rangers don't play many afternoon games because of the heat we have here in the summer
sw2606A-ms98-a-0074 378.500875 382.706250 but uh they try to play Sunday afternoons in April May and in September
sw2606A-ms98-a-0075 382.706250 391.682500 and uh uh with the bright sky like this where you've got a real bright day when he's out there throwing ninety four ninety five miles an hour he's almost invincible
sw2606A-ms98-a-0076 391.682500 398.110000 and uh that's just a exciting uh is really exciting sitting here watching him on TV this afternoon
sw2606A-ms98-a-0077 398.110000 400.685125 and
sw2606A-ms98-a-0078 400.685125 403.874250 uh well it different times different years bec[ause]-
sw2606A-ms98-a-0079 403.874250 404.989125 because
sw2606A-ms98-a-0080 404.989125 407.544500 [silence]
sw2606A-ms98-a-0081 407.544500 409.404125 because my uh
sw2606A-ms98-a-0082 409.404125 420.756125 uh my job takes me out of the country a lot and it always seems to be during the summer uh last year we got to go out maybe about a dozen times which is the most we've ever gone out and we had about uh the Rangers
sw2606A-ms98-a-0083 420.756125 431.962875 won uh eighty three games last year which was just four more than they lost but we had an exciting time and that at one time in about the June July and August period we went to about eight straight wins
sw2606A-ms98-a-0084 431.962875 444.163500 and we happen to go out there on win night [laughter-and] uh uh they and they got hot then and i'm not sure they put the prices up a dollar a ticket this year we may have to go less but
sw2606A-ms98-a-0085 444.163500 453.068500 what we like to do the uh the stands have got three tiers to them and we like to be in the third tier behind home plate about the second row
sw2606A-ms98-a-0086 453.068500 463.127625 and uh the the park holds about forty thousand people and uh i never go on a night when they think there's going to be forty thousand there's just too big crowds i i pick the games where they don't
sw2606A-ms98-a-0087 463.127625 471.270500 expect to have a high attendance and uh what what about your your ball park in in Raleigh uh the minor league ball in Durham
sw2606A-ms98-a-0088 471.270500 472.446375 [silence]
sw2606A-ms98-a-0089 472.446375 473.113125 yeah
sw2606A-ms98-a-0090 473.113125 476.159375 [silence]
sw2606A-ms98-a-0091 476.159375 476.908875 four thousand
sw2606A-ms98-a-0092 476.908875 478.281125 [silence]
sw2606A-ms98-a-0093 478.281125 482.431375 oh that is great when i got here in the class triple A Rangers we used to
sw2606A-ms98-a-0094 482.431375 485.794750 pay two and if you bought a season ticket it was only one dollar a game
sw2606A-ms98-a-0095 485.794750 492.369750 and uh uh that is fine and not only that but you probably get some pretty good seats too
sw2606A-ms98-a-0096 492.369750 493.907750 [silence]
sw2606A-ms98-a-0097 493.907750 502.769000 yeah yeah what do they do they have times of the year where they have promotions and you get gigantic crowds like maybe four thousand where they actually sell the place out
sw2606A-ms98-a-0098 502.769000 506.300000 [silence]
sw2606A-ms98-a-0099 506.300000 507.162000 yes
sw2606A-ms98-a-0100 507.162000 508.358125 [silence]
sw2606A-ms98-a-0101 508.358125 509.539750 yeah
sw2606A-ms98-a-0102 509.539750 510.988000 [silence]
sw2606A-ms98-a-0103 510.988000 512.065000 oh yeah
sw2606A-ms98-a-0104 512.065000 524.018375 yeah i love that movie i absolutely love that and i guess the players uh you know the class A salaries are are really uh not anything a guy can live on too much so i guess they've got to go out and find rooming houses and
sw2606A-ms98-a-0105 524.018375 528.791125 things like the guy in Bull Durham did With fairly economical accommodations
sw2606A-ms98-a-0106 528.791125 542.546875 yeah and uh uh the other thing is that that's really hard but of course you recognize the minor league team exists for the purpose of the major league team and the problem we always had in triple A is you want to see the guys go good but then when they go good you know you're going to lose them_1
sw2606A-ms98-a-0107 542.546875 543.673250 you know during the season
sw2606A-ms98-a-0108 543.673250 558.299250 and i guess at at your level uh you lose them to the next level if if they decide to recall the the parent team the Braves decide to call to recall a guy from triple A then a double A guy goes up to replace him and a single A [laughter-guy] goes up to replace him
sw2606A-ms98-a-0109 558.299250 573.223000 and and and you've immediately uh now you got a your you go out to the ball park and your favorite player is not there anymore and you say you've got you've got to learn his his replacement but do you get any local uh do do they broadcast the games locally or televise them_1 locally
sw2606A-ms98-a-0110 573.223000 576.865500 no so you've you've got to uh
sw2606A-ms98-a-0111 576.865500 578.543500 [silence]
sw2606A-ms98-a-0112 578.543500 579.859750 yeah okay so
sw2606A-ms98-a-0113 579.859750 584.645000 so you you got you've got a pretty much go to the ball park uh uh to figure out but 
sw2606A-ms98-a-0114 584.645000 588.014375 [silence]
sw2606A-ms98-a-0115 588.014375 597.156500 yeah but yeah yeah uh uh there's probably that's pretty neat because i don't imagine Raleigh's so big that you have big traffic jams going one way or the other
