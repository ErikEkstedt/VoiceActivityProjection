sw2618A-ms98-a-0020 65.056625 77.485125 and uh running after them or going biking with them or just exploring you know on a little explor[ation]- exploration hike you know through the neighborhood it's amazing you know how many earthworms you can find and
sw2618A-ms98-a-0021 77.485125 86.345250 and to a five year old they're they never get old you know an earthworm every single time she finds one it's uh it's a brand new exciting activity for her

sw2618A-ms98-a-0033 146.959625 150.697375 um you know the earth is is part of him
sw2618A-ms98-a-0034 150.697375 159.574500 and he is part of it and i think that's a real important thing and we we enjoy going camping we haven't yet had them sleeping on the ground primarily because
sw2618A-ms98-a-0035 159.574500 171.253500 to them uh or to the five year old the two year old would freak out about it but she wouldn't quite get totally unnerved but the five year old still has a fear of spiders
sw2618A-ms98-a-0036 171.253500 182.824625 and i'm afraid that if she woke up one with her we would have to pack up and come home [laughter] so we've primarily done our camping by cabin up at Turner Falls up in Oklahoma
sw2618A-ms98-a-0037 182.824625 184.594625 [silence]

sw2618A-ms98-a-0040 187.838125 196.167125 well it was up there actually that she got her fear of spiders because we sat and watched a tarantula for a long time we we you know we'd never seen one
sw2618A-ms98-a-0041 196.167125 207.844375 or she had never seen one we my husband and i had but sh[e]- we'd never seen one as a family and so we just sat and watched it for the longest time [vocalized-noise] it was you know removed from us by probably five or six feet 
sw2618A-ms98-a-0042 207.844375 216.742250 so we weren't concerned about it and we just sat and watched it and we explained you know how it did well that night she had a nightmare and she has been terrified of spiders since
sw2618A-ms98-a-0043 216.742250 220.775750 but we still go up there and we still have a [laughter-great] [laughter-time]

sw2618A-ms98-a-0048 248.243625 261.085250 we uh that's [vocalized-noise] you know that's our favorite form of exercise is is life and we do our own yard [laughter-you] [laughter-know] we uh we we enjoy the activities that provide exercise 
sw2618A-ms98-a-0049 261.085250 273.290000 both of us would love to exercise on a routine basis but our life doesn't um really have that much time in it so we just enjoy what we can along with our family you know

sw2618A-ms98-a-0056 300.725000 312.118250 uh the [vocalized-noise] you know the girls can learn things in school about everything that is temporary but as far as really knowing the earth there's no other way to really learn it but to experience it 
sw2618A-ms98-a-0057 312.118250 315.966250 and we really have a great time with it i'm sure that's the way that you felt with your boys
