sw2618B-ms98-a-0027 97.027625 102.000375 when they were just uh pre teenagers we um
sw2618B-ms98-a-0028 102.000375 105.891000 we decided the only way we could afford vacations is to go camping

sw2618B-ms98-a-0030 107.119750 113.683125 and we thoroughly enjoyed it i mean we went whole hog we had the tents and everything else and and pretty much roughed it
sw2618B-ms98-a-0031 113.683125 116.314875 sleeping on the ground and all
sw2618B-ms98-a-0032 116.314875 123.212000 and uh i like to think that my children my sons learned a lot about uh the outdoors uh uh
sw2618B-ms98-a-0033 123.212000 125.563625 uh being self-sustaining
sw2618B-ms98-a-0034 125.563625 132.965125 uh uh i would have no doubt what so ever that any one of them could be dropped in the middle of no where and they'd uh they'd ex[ist]- 
sw2618B-ms98-a-0035 132.965125 134.867375 exist somehow

sw2618B-ms98-a-0047 224.913500 232.410250 uh do the same thing again introduce her to a to a spider at a reasonable distance where she isn't frightened
sw2618B-ms98-a-0048 232.410250 237.630375 and uh and that that that the the nightmare i'm sure was just a a freak
sw2618B-ms98-a-0049 237.630375 239.659875 i'll bet it wouldn't happen again
sw2618B-ms98-a-0050 239.659875 243.481625 [silence]

sw2618B-ms98-a-0062 315.654125 319.793125 oh definitely definitely it was a learning experience uh
sw2618B-ms98-a-0063 319.793125 325.289125 now we i guess we camped just about every public campground in the state of Florida
sw2618B-ms98-a-0064 325.289125 328.386875 [silence]
sw2618B-ms98-a-0065 328.386875 332.190875 oh yes yes yell they used to be but now they're trying to really

sw2618B-ms98-a-0068 335.874250 339.209375 visitors i think they're doing a very stupid thing
sw2618B-ms98-a-0069 339.209375 341.058125 [silence]
sw2618B-ms98-a-0070 341.058125 353.260250 well they charge extra now they there was a time here a few years ago when they put an extra tax on all the campgrounds and the uh motels and hotels 
sw2618B-ms98-a-0071 353.260250 366.886250 so they are are uh you know really putting it to the visitors and people got a little fed up with it and they sudd[enly]- and suddenly the the foundling fathers of uh of Florida found out that they were losing beaucoup bucks
sw2618B-ms98-a-0072 366.886250 370.463000 people were going elsewhere for uh their vacations
sw2618B-ms98-a-0073 370.463000 372.175750 [silence]
sw2618B-ms98-a-0074 372.175750 375.708000 exactly so they got rid of that tax in a hurry
