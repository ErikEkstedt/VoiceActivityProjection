sw2642B-ms98-a-0062 401.339625 406.711375 yeah i think it's it's somewhat a um symptom of our
sw2642B-ms98-a-0063 406.711375 413.712750 me generation and that we think we need all these things and i think my parents always
sw2642B-ms98-a-0064 413.712750 423.152500 you know did without or saved up to you know buy things and we consider that so many of these things we just have to have
sw2642B-ms98-a-0065 423.152500 429.315625 you know like when i first got my apartment and i was setting it up i did try to economize some but
sw2642B-ms98-a-0066 429.315625 438.495000 you know i was just like well i have to have it all furnished and i have to have all of my kitchen setup and you don't you know do without too much and
sw2642B-ms98-a-0067 438.495000 445.719750 you know that's how i got started kind of with setting up a household all up you know it kind of like in the short amount of time
sw2642B-ms98-a-0068 445.719750 454.978625 you know you just have to have these things just you know have them_1 at home have to have them_1 at my own place and that's you know a big expenditure to start um
sw2642B-ms98-a-0069 454.978625 468.990750 buying all these things that you think or or have to have and actually they're kind of luxuries or you should save up slowly and keep buying them_1 and not just rush out and furnish the whole place you know going in one big swoop save up and then buy it
sw2642B-ms98-a-0070 468.990750 472.942125 but we're not into that we're into like have to have it all now
sw2642B-ms98-a-0071 472.942125 494.305125 [silence]
sw2642B-ms98-a-0072 494.305125 501.003000 well we're geared to that we're like okay like i want a living room set and instead of sitting back and and
sw2642B-ms98-a-0073 501.003000 511.194000 going okay well it's going to cost maybe a thousand dollars two thousand dollars and i'll save for two years people go oh well i'll just go buy it put it on credit and i'll pay it off
sw2642B-ms98-a-0074 511.194000 522.937250 people aren't tuned in to like saving for it and then buying it they just put it on a charge card put it on account and then pay off the bill because_1 they want it now it's always have to have it now
sw2642B-ms98-a-0075 522.937250 527.985125 [silence]
sw2642B-ms98-a-0076 527.985125 536.486375 [laughter] no no but i have had some times when i've had some pretty good balances on there and uh you know i finally
sw2642B-ms98-a-0077 536.486375 548.433875 you know paid them_1 all off and thought this is you know kind of nonsense so we don't uh have big balances on them_1 at all now we're we're you know we i use it occasionally but i pay it right off we're
sw2642B-ms98-a-0078 548.433875 556.263250 yeah you learn the you know the hard way you hate paying all that interest and i've never been one to itemize on my income tax and never had
sw2642B-ms98-a-0079 556.263250 565.494500 enough to itemize and so it's just a big chunk of money and you realize that you're not buying anything on sale your paying so much more for that item
sw2642B-ms98-a-0080 565.494500 573.721375 because you've got finance charge and the cost of having that card every year which is what forty dollars sometimes just to have the card
sw2642B-ms98-a-0081 573.721375 577.480375 that's a lot of money that you went to buy this item
sw2642B-ms98-a-0082 577.480375 585.316750 and then you never feel like you've got anything to to put into savings or anything you're always just paying bills paying bills
sw2642B-ms98-a-0083 585.316750 599.719500 you know you don't feel that you have any extra to save and i hate i hate living paycheck to paycheck i like to have a little there you know that i can save so i can feel that you know if something comes up i've got the money to pay for it
