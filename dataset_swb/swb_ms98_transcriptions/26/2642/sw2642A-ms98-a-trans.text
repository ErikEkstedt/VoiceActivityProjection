sw2642A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.148000 [noise] 
sw2642A-ms98-a-0002 0.148000 1.499875 okay 
sw2642A-ms98-a-0003 1.499875 3.273875 how do you feel about them_1
sw2642A-ms98-a-0004 3.273875 31.680625 [silence]
sw2642A-ms98-a-0005 31.680625 33.485125 yeah
sw2642A-ms98-a-0006 33.485125 38.719375 well we have this philosophy we use it when we go off somewhere
sw2642A-ms98-a-0007 38.719375 47.490750 but we pay for it as soon as we come back you know as soon as we get our bills we pay it off and we only have one we tore all the rest of them_1 up
sw2642A-ms98-a-0008 47.490750 58.956875 because i don't like credit cards for one thing you know i mean they're okay i guess if you're on a trip or something you don't have to take a whole bunch of you know cash with you but i don't like using
sw2642A-ms98-a-0009 58.956875 72.533375 because i've seen too many people that used them_1 and ended up bankrupt or on chapter thirteen and stuff like that because they have this weird opinion that if you use that card you don't have to pay for it
sw2642A-ms98-a-0010 72.533375 83.239875 [silence]
sw2642A-ms98-a-0011 83.239875 96.532750 yeah yeah and it gives you a sense um a false sense of security or something it seems like because you say oh well i don't have to pay for it now but you're going to have to pay for it and it seems like
sw2642A-ms98-a-0012 96.532750 98.993875 [silence]
sw2642A-ms98-a-0013 98.993875 100.492250 uh-huh
sw2642A-ms98-a-0014 100.492250 103.351500 [silence]
sw2642A-ms98-a-0015 103.351500 106.472500 right are you married
sw2642A-ms98-a-0016 106.472500 113.265750 oh okay well i know that a lot of young people you know i it took me a long time to
sw2642A-ms98-a-0017 113.265750 125.438125 get it through my child's head i mean that was her goal you know uh got to have a credit card but now that she has one she's only used it one time but she wanted to establish some credit
sw2642A-ms98-a-0018 125.438125 132.694875 but i think it finally sunk in you know because_1 she saw some of the other people and just like she heard them_1 say you know well i used a credit card
sw2642A-ms98-a-0019 132.694875 142.023000 and my husband's sister is the world's worst at oh well i'll just use the credit cards and she has all of her credit cards up to the limit
sw2642A-ms98-a-0020 142.023000 150.021625 you know and i'm i'm thinking woman [laughter] wake up and smell the roses before they come and get you but
sw2642A-ms98-a-0021 150.021625 153.725000 [silence]
sw2642A-ms98-a-0022 153.725000 156.281375 right and people don't see that either
sw2642A-ms98-a-0023 156.281375 166.686625 [silence]
sw2642A-ms98-a-0024 166.686625 172.429250 right the only one that we we have that we kept was the Discover card
sw2642A-ms98-a-0025 172.429250 186.987500 and it pays you to use it i mean if you pay your bill off right away if you don't ever have to pay any interest on it because they give you a certain amount every time that you use it
sw2642A-ms98-a-0026 186.987500 200.492250 and you make that money as long as you don't ever have to pay them_1 any uh interest now it's and people say well you know i'm making money by using this credit card but they don't realize that if they
sw2642A-ms98-a-0027 200.492250 208.177875 i mean it only takes one time for you to use it and not pay the interest i mean you have to pay the interest not pay it right off
sw2642A-ms98-a-0028 208.177875 210.977250 that's going to take up what you would have made
sw2642A-ms98-a-0029 210.977250 216.993625 so that's the only reason that we kept that we debated for a long time plus they don't have that um
sw2642A-ms98-a-0030 216.993625 222.988250 charge on it you know like yeah right they don't have one of those
sw2642A-ms98-a-0031 222.988250 233.984625 so it we decided that was it you know and i mean everybody calls us and wants to give us a credit card we have we could have credit cards running out our ears
sw2642A-ms98-a-0032 233.984625 247.472500 yes yes and then i['ll]- i'll have just like uh department stores they'll call me up you know and i'll say look i don't want the credit card well we're just going to send it to you you know you don't have to ever use it if you don't want to they'll send me any credit card i tear it up
sw2642A-ms98-a-0033 247.472500 249.459000 i just can't see it
sw2642A-ms98-a-0034 249.459000 252.737125 [silence]
sw2642A-ms98-a-0035 252.737125 254.241000 uh-huh
sw2642A-ms98-a-0036 254.241000 256.727625 [silence]
sw2642A-ms98-a-0037 256.727625 258.487375 yeah
sw2642A-ms98-a-0038 258.487375 268.684625 [silence]
sw2642A-ms98-a-0039 268.684625 272.221500 i know it and you know what
sw2642A-ms98-a-0040 272.221500 282.742125 what's really bad about those though is just like young people if they don't you know we take the time to you know help my daughter she's in college
sw2642A-ms98-a-0041 282.742125 289.764250 but it this is her first credit card thing well when she got her first one she was so excited it was unreal look at this they sent me this money you know
sw2642A-ms98-a-0042 289.764250 299.035125 so then when i explained to her look you have to pay this back and they are going to charge you interest and stuff of course she [ter/tore] tore it up but a lot of parents would not take the time
sw2642A-ms98-a-0043 299.035125 305.456625 you know and they wouldn't even think of it or their kids may not be as close as my daughter and i are
sw2642A-ms98-a-0044 305.456625 316.290875 and um you know they may not even discuss it they go out and cash that check thinking that you know they've got something maybe they've won something you know somebody sent them_1 something free and go out and spend it
sw2642A-ms98-a-0045 316.290875 326.956875 and um it's just unreal i mean i don't like credit cards i wish that they would come up with some other way to you know the only way you could use them_1 is if you were
sw2642A-ms98-a-0046 326.956875 339.485125 like on vacation they would let you use it maybe once a year you know i mean of course i guess some people go out and spend their whole entire limit on it like that at that time but um
sw2642A-ms98-a-0047 339.485125 345.179500 i have seen so many people and i have a friend right now she just got off of thirteen
sw2642A-ms98-a-0048 345.179500 358.711125 she got uh i can't remember what she called it it's some kind of maybe it's sure or something like that it's something it's some weird name of a credit card and she is charging out of her mind already and i'm going you just got off
sw2642A-ms98-a-0049 358.711125 371.183250 that's how you got on to it to start with you know what is the matter with this person [laughter] but um it seems like people just you know they just think well i can just have anything i want
sw2642A-ms98-a-0050 371.183250 383.464750 and i just don't see it like that of course i always see pay the bills first and whatever's leftover that's what you have but um maybe a lot of people don't see it like that but i can't stand owing
sw2642A-ms98-a-0051 383.464750 390.455000 i mean i cannot hardly tolerate to owe something like you know i guess it's just because i've been brought up like that
sw2642A-ms98-a-0052 390.455000 400.780125 but um i could not charge to the limit and knowing that i was going to have to pay this thing out for ever and maybe suffer from having to pay out
sw2642A-ms98-a-0053 400.780125 404.488500 but that's just the way i feel about it
sw2642A-ms98-a-0054 404.488500 464.804375 [silence]
sw2642A-ms98-a-0055 464.804375 466.689000 right

sw2642A-ms98-a-0058 470.449875 471.954625 [silence]
sw2642A-ms98-a-0059 471.954625 479.259625 oh yeah i guess it is like that though because it seems like more and more people are like that
sw2642A-ms98-a-0060 479.259625 490.718000 but um i guess it's because i'm older i mean i'm not real old but i am older and um you know i didn't feel like that i didn't feel like i had to have everything i guess it was because
sw2642A-ms98-a-0061 490.718000 495.480750 well i had everything when i was at home but i i don't know why i didn't [laughter]

sw2642A-ms98-a-0069 522.051625 529.242125 yeah um well it didn't hurt you did it to i mean you didn't go out and charge a whole bunch and lose everything did you
sw2642A-ms98-a-0070 529.242125 546.331875 [silence]
sw2642A-ms98-a-0071 546.331875 550.247375 yeah well you learned then right
