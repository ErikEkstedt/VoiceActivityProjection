sw2637B-ms98-a-0033 217.634875 226.699875 the recipe i've used is you marinate it in a can of beer and a bottle of Italian dressing and then you can either gr[ill]- uh-huh
sw2637B-ms98-a-0034 226.699875 229.921625 and then you can either grill it or you can um
sw2637B-ms98-a-0035 229.921625 242.727500 broil it we usually grill it outside and then you cut it into real small real thin pieces and serve it on flour tortillas with like grated cheese and sour cream and guacamole and that type of thing

sw2637B-ms98-a-0040 268.464500 272.474125 [silence]
sw2637B-ms98-a-0041 272.474125 275.745000 it it's kind of a thin steak
sw2637B-ms98-a-0042 275.745000 279.208250 and so it doesn't take very long to to grill
sw2637B-ms98-a-0043 279.208250 284.995375 [silence]

sw2637B-ms98-a-0049 322.280250 329.496375 maybe i usually cover it with Saran wrap or something and then [noise] or start it in the morning and it's ready in the evening to cook

sw2637B-ms98-a-0062 369.282250 379.997500 in fact as a wedding gift we got a tortilla warmer but i don't think very many people have [laughter-those] and it doesn't hold very many tortillas so we don't use that often
