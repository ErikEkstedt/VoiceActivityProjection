sw2637A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 3.698250 [noise] do you have a recipe that you would like to share
sw2637A-ms98-a-0002 3.698250 5.774875 [noise]
sw2637A-ms98-a-0003 5.774875 18.387500 okay uh [laughter] we i find that the nicest party for dinner uh uh group for a dinner party is eight people uh they set at my dining room table easily
sw2637A-ms98-a-0004 18.387500 30.809500 and it just seems like you can decorate a table and and you can serve easily with eight people uh particularly if you're wanting to do the soup to nuts thing which uh with my
sw2637A-ms98-a-0005 30.809500 45.047750 dishes i have a really pretty soup tureen so i like to start out with you know some kind of soup that nobody's had lately like sauerkraut soup or minestrone depending upon what the menu theme is
sw2637A-ms98-a-0006 45.047750 49.336500 but one thing that i like to do um
sw2637A-ms98-a-0007 49.336500 62.364625 of course i always want to make it easy on the cook and uh the lady who is the manager of the country club gave me a really good recipe for ham loaf that it's something you can make up ahead and then stick in the oven you know
sw2637A-ms98-a-0008 62.364625 66.711000 aft[er]- after your guests are here and you've started cocktails really
sw2637A-ms98-a-0009 66.711000 78.188625 uh us[ually]- course you have to have some kind of entertainment too and and we do play bridge my husband plays when i make him [laughter] and uh [laughter]
sw2637A-ms98-a-0010 78.188625 84.684500 w[ell]- usually our friends the women are the bridge players and the men are there because it's an excuse to get together
sw2637A-ms98-a-0011 84.684500 90.893750 but i do find that i[n]- in order to have your party last beyond
sw2637A-ms98-a-0012 90.893750 102.746250 the dinner table there h[ave]- there does have to be something to go on to or you just kind of sit around and everybody goes to sleep and gets bored you know there's got to be a a silly game or a
sw2637A-ms98-a-0013 102.746250 105.485375 something fun to do afterwards
sw2637A-ms98-a-0014 105.485375 114.489875 [silence]
sw2637A-ms98-a-0015 114.489875 115.984000 um-hum
sw2637A-ms98-a-0016 115.984000 117.756750 [silence]
sw2637A-ms98-a-0017 117.756750 120.760750 you have more summer than we do though
sw2637A-ms98-a-0018 120.760750 121.829375 [silence]
sw2637A-ms98-a-0019 121.829375 131.377250 yeah we can do that well starting the end of this well starting now we can do that through October
sw2637A-ms98-a-0020 131.377250 145.218625 but that's about it for us and then we're basically inside you know even if it's really warm during the day at night it's going to cool off and by the time you would get ready to eat you're going to want to be in
sw2637A-ms98-a-0021 145.218625 153.989750 so our climate is not as conducive to the outdoor entertaining as yours are although it's certainly a lot more casual and a lot more fun
sw2637A-ms98-a-0022 153.989750 155.489375 yeah
sw2637A-ms98-a-0023 155.489375 156.814375 [silence]
sw2637A-ms98-a-0024 156.814375 160.498125 right [laughter] i
sw2637A-ms98-a-0025 160.498125 164.483750 [silence]
sw2637A-ms98-a-0026 164.483750 179.466125 yeah and i think outside you can just kind of kick back and and visit after dinner but is seems like when you're inside the first thing you know someone has turned on a TV and that kind of is the end of your party i think
sw2637A-ms98-a-0027 179.466125 186.471375 what do you do uh for a barbecue when you cook out what's your favorite thing
sw2637A-ms98-a-0028 186.471375 190.497500 [silence]
sw2637A-ms98-a-0029 190.497500 192.495125 yeah
sw2637A-ms98-a-0030 192.495125 204.499875 [silence]
