sw2670B-ms98-a-0003 2.674875 8.026250 i liked it i really did actually i saw it twice my room[mate]- ex-roommate and i were
sw2670B-ms98-a-0004 8.026250 14.519750 real into psychological things we we think people with mind problems are really [laughter-interesting] [laughter-so]
sw2670B-ms98-a-0005 14.519750 25.077875 i mean you know real psychotic people so we were dying to see it so we went and saw it and i had to see it the second time to get it all because i kept my eyes closed through so much of the first part
sw2670B-ms98-a-0006 25.077875 31.335000 well it's it's not that it's that scary it's that it's so graphic
sw2670B-ms98-a-0007 31.335000 35.490125 because uh how well are you going to see it i don't want to tell you how it ends [laughter]

sw2670B-ms98-a-0011 44.924250 45.896375 [silence]
sw2670B-ms98-a-0012 45.896375 53.483875 [laughter-okay] well it's uh what is so weird about it is that it it's a real it's based on real people
sw2670B-ms98-a-0013 53.483875 63.188000 and i read the story in People magazine about where they got the characters in the movie and they're a combination of a lot of different serial killers in real life
sw2670B-ms98-a-0014 63.188000 69.467625 and so a lot of things that happen in the movie the only thing really scary about it is that it could happen to you
sw2670B-ms98-a-0015 69.467625 75.868000 it really does happen in real life you know nor[mally]- normally in movies you can look at it and say well it's a movie
sw2670B-ms98-a-0016 75.868000 77.105625 [silence]
sw2670B-ms98-a-0017 77.105625 78.245750 right
sw2670B-ms98-a-0018 78.245750 83.464250 right but in this you're going i i would have done that i can see where that would [laughter-happen]
sw2670B-ms98-a-0019 83.464250 92.550750 and it's it gets really scary but it's it's a real interesting movie very thought provoking there are so many things to discuss when the movie's over
sw2670B-ms98-a-0020 92.550750 96.882250 if you're one of those people that likes to discuss things and and think about why it happened
sw2670B-ms98-a-0021 96.882250 108.925250 i i still talk about it with [vocalized-noise] we'll call each other every now and then and go remember when in the movie this happened well i was just reading [laughter-today] and and things just keep relating back to it i thought it was fascinating
sw2670B-ms98-a-0022 108.925250 112.694000 [silence]
sw2670B-ms98-a-0023 112.694000 116.247875 i don't know if you [laughter-want] [laughter-to] [laughter-go] [laughter-to] [laughter-dinner] [laughter]

sw2670B-ms98-a-0029 132.665125 140.439125 i didn't think i'd like it i don't normally like the uh the old West type movies things like that the
sw2670B-ms98-a-0030 140.439125 148.878625 they don't normally interest me but that one i really really liked because_1 it it i didn't know so much about the Indians and all that
sw2670B-ms98-a-0031 148.878625 151.598500 that happened in that part of the war
sw2670B-ms98-a-0032 151.598500 159.112000 i had never heard anything really about that before and this was a whole new idea to me anyway i thought it was real good

sw2670B-ms98-a-0059 238.458500 251.018375 it makes you realize how really ignorant some white people are people who have no ethnic background no heritage anything other than just typical Americans a little bit of everything and they don't really know
sw2670B-ms98-a-0060 251.018375 256.791125 they don't know anything about the Indian people they don't know anything about the Europeans that came over
sw2670B-ms98-a-0061 256.791125 263.139500 you know it it really made it seem like we are so in the dark on so many things

sw2670B-ms98-a-0070 302.712875 314.065625 i mean they we wanted the land and we didn't want them to have it so just screw everything they're going to think and teach us and tell us and and we could just like wipe out an entire
sw2670B-ms98-a-0071 314.065625 316.084625 people like that

sw2670B-ms98-a-0091 381.229875 386.458875 that's really sad that things like that can still happen today after all this time

sw2670B-ms98-a-0100 407.205750 413.697500 [laughter] i really did like Silence of the Lambs though that was really an interesting movie i
sw2670B-ms98-a-0101 413.697500 425.539125 i liked Dances with Wolves but it was a m[ore]- an emotional like you get real involved and you cried and you feel real sorry for the people you know and all this but in Silence of the Lambs it was kind of that Fatal Attraction did you see that
sw2670B-ms98-a-0102 425.539125 431.834250 it was kind of that feeling through the whole thing on the edge of your seat wanting to tell the people what to do next
sw2670B-ms98-a-0103 431.834250 439.754750 you know you're like no don't go in there don't give him your [laughter-name] [laughter] you you ju[st]- you start [laughter-acting] it out for them [laughter]

sw2670B-ms98-a-0105 443.680375 454.623625 no believe it or not the whole theatre got involved i mean yes in fact i'm trying to i can't remember which scene it was but at one point everyone in the theatre clapped
sw2670B-ms98-a-0106 454.623625 461.292250 they were so happy it was it w[as]- and i thought i was just there and i heard other people crying when i was crying
sw2670B-ms98-a-0107 461.292250 470.617500 there were certain parts in there that were real sad and you hear people when you know the the actors are doing things that you know are about to reap some bad thing and
sw2670B-ms98-a-0108 470.617500 477.698000 everyone in the theatre will go [noise] and you know everybody does it it's like the whole theatre you get this big [noise] [laughter-sound] [laughter-and]
sw2670B-ms98-a-0109 477.698000 482.045875 it w[as]- i i think everybody felt that way through it it was ve[ry]- real involved
sw2670B-ms98-a-0110 482.045875 489.340250 and all the girls were crying when they walked out and all the guys were just kind of staring straight ahead like that didn't bother me and you know it [laughter-did]
sw2670B-ms98-a-0111 489.340250 491.246750 [laughter] i
sw2670B-ms98-a-0112 491.246750 496.502625 [laughter-right] i remember the first time i saw it was with my boyfriend
sw2670B-ms98-a-0113 496.502625 501.773375 and he was joking with me about how i wasn't going to watch half of it i was going to close my eyes
sw2670B-ms98-a-0114 501.773375 508.893250 and there were quite a few scenes where i did but this one scene i knew something bad was coming i could tell so i ducked my head
sw2670B-ms98-a-0115 508.893250 513.531375 and about that time i heard the audience go [noise] and my boyfriend jumped
sw2670B-ms98-a-0116 513.531375 517.800125 he literally jumped and he swears he didn't do it and i felt him jump
sw2670B-ms98-a-0117 517.800125 519.645500 [laughter-and]
sw2670B-ms98-a-0118 519.645500 526.753125 it really was to this day i tell him he was scared and he says no no you you just didn't watch it you should have watched it it wasn't that bad
sw2670B-ms98-a-0119 526.753125 528.949125 i'm like yeah right that's why you jumped
sw2670B-ms98-a-0120 528.949125 531.638000 [laughter]
sw2670B-ms98-a-0121 531.638000 533.249125 [silence]
sw2670B-ms98-a-0122 533.249125 536.843000 yeah really it is a great movie you got to see it
sw2670B-ms98-a-0123 536.843000 541.989625 it's so fascinating to think that there are people that are so
sw2670B-ms98-a-0124 541.989625 550.729000 so smart they're such geniuses that they've cross that line and they're they're psychotic and it's amazing
sw2670B-ms98-a-0125 550.729000 556.549000 it really is i mean to think that it could be anybody we know i mean you could be
sw2670B-ms98-a-0126 556.549000 563.722125 walking right next to one of them_1 and not even know it because they look perfectly normal i mean this man was a doctor
sw2670B-ms98-a-0127 563.722125 571.809875 and he had patients in fact they were the people he killed you know and you think right now your doctor could be wacko
sw2670B-ms98-a-0128 571.809875 575.630625 he could be some psychotic killer and no one would ever know
sw2670B-ms98-a-0129 575.630625 581.368625 it's just strange but that that was what was that was what made the movie because it's so real
sw2670B-ms98-a-0130 581.368625 585.066000 i like movies that are based on on things that are real
sw2670B-ms98-a-0131 585.066000 594.947375 [silence]
