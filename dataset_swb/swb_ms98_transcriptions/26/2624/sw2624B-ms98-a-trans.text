sw2624B-ms98-a-0078 281.476875 294.980000 but i'm a little bit unsympathetic with the families right here in our own small town of five thousand who have not limited their family we have three children and that happens to be what we could afford but
sw2624B-ms98-a-0079 294.980000 308.847750 i don't really feel like i ought to help even if they're people from Indiana support ten children that's not fair i didn't get a say whether they had them or not so i don't think i ought to have to help raise them maybe i'm um

sw2624B-ms98-a-0088 342.722375 354.530125 claimed to have her se[lf]- her act together and she was given back to her birth mother who she had never seen i mean it was just one of those awful things where the Child Protection Service completely broke down
sw2624B-ms98-a-0089 354.530125 363.358750 and now two years later the court ordered that she be given back to the foster people i it's just awful it's just awful the whole thing
sw2624B-ms98-a-0090 363.358750 369.133250 it's just awful i i as i say i'm isolationist i think we need to
sw2624B-ms98-a-0091 369.133250 380.987875 to close our doors to some of the immigration and now they're talking about how we're bound to have an influx of immigrants from the latest war from Iraq Iran
sw2624B-ms98-a-0092 380.987875 394.296125 Saudi Arabia so on and so forth and uh i'm i'm really sorry that i feel the way i do but i just think that we need to not take people as we have over the man[y]- last many many years

sw2624B-ms98-a-0115 480.991750 490.667000 well she's a director at a care center close to here in fact my mother's a resident there anyhow w[as]- uh she got us involved in the Christian Children's Fund
sw2624B-ms98-a-0116 490.667000 504.887625 and we were sponsoring a young boy in Chattanooga Tennessee in a home then and that went on for oh four or five years and finally we had a letter from the Christian Children's Fund that they were no longer going to
sw2624B-ms98-a-0117 504.887625 514.085250 uh sponsor children within the continental United States that all of the money would be going to children overseas because
sw2624B-ms98-a-0118 514.085250 523.638375 for however much money we were sending a month they could buy so much more milk and bread and rice and so on and so forth for children overseas well at
sw2624B-ms98-a-0119 523.638375 533.947625 yeah well at that point we said no we're not doing this any more we wanted to help somebody here within the continental United States it wasn't our choice to
sw2624B-ms98-a-0120 533.947625 547.692250 to send and then too i think that money gets watered down in administrative costs when it all goes overseas and i always wonder if people who need it actually get it

sw2624B-ms98-a-0129 572.503750 579.563750 we were on a cruise ship one time and some people from the Methodist Church were talking about how their
sw2624B-ms98-a-0130 579.563750 588.678000 church diocese had poured thousands of dollars into Haiti and it had been used for Papa Doc's daughter's wedding
sw2624B-ms98-a-0131 588.678000 595.156625 which [laughter] i'm sure that's not what they had in mind when they were pouring that money in the
