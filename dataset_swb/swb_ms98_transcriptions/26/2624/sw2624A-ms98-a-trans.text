sw2624A-ms98-a-0002 0.476250 3.701625 the subject is how we feel about immigration
sw2624A-ms98-a-0003 3.701625 7.157250 would you like to get started or would you like me to
sw2624A-ms98-a-0004 7.157250 19.701500 [silence]
sw2624A-ms98-a-0005 19.701500 21.023875 um-hum
sw2624A-ms98-a-0006 21.023875 26.421125 [silence]
sw2624A-ms98-a-0007 26.421125 28.007125 yes
sw2624A-ms98-a-0008 28.007125 30.207250 that's happened to me too
sw2624A-ms98-a-0009 30.207250 46.932000 [silence]
sw2624A-ms98-a-0010 46.932000 48.900750 oh my
sw2624A-ms98-a-0011 48.900750 72.116750 [silence]
sw2624A-ms98-a-0012 72.116750 82.478250 well i have i'm really torn on the subject i'm not a good candidate for this one i see what you see and i agree with you
sw2624A-ms98-a-0013 82.478250 85.731125 well the other side i see
sw2624A-ms98-a-0014 85.731125 91.126500 because we have Mexico as a neighbor
sw2624A-ms98-a-0015 91.126500 94.641000 and i can tell you right now
sw2624A-ms98-a-0016 94.641000 99.107625 that if i were living in Mexico
sw2624A-ms98-a-0017 99.107625 106.052625 and trying to raise several children and i could see across the border where the good life would be for my children
sw2624A-ms98-a-0018 106.052625 116.349375 would i swim that river every night twice if that's what it took you know i don't care whatever it would take i have real sympathy for those people i really do and you can
sw2624A-ms98-a-0019 116.349375 120.150375 [silence]
sw2624A-ms98-a-0020 120.150375 123.292625 probably they don't have birth control
sw2624A-ms98-a-0021 123.292625 127.130250 they have no concept of it it's against their church
sw2624A-ms98-a-0022 127.130250 131.314250 [silence]
sw2624A-ms98-a-0023 131.314250 139.577625 well but they don't have if you know if i had to put myself in their shoes i have to do it one hundred percent
sw2624A-ms98-a-0024 139.577625 144.590125 their church doesn't teach birth control they preach against it
sw2624A-ms98-a-0025 144.590125 148.521750 i understand what you're saying but i'm saying
sw2624A-ms98-a-0026 148.521750 149.785750 [silence]
sw2624A-ms98-a-0027 149.785750 160.011875 i feel real sympathy for them so i really and and and by the way i feel the same way when i i just got back from Florida
sw2624A-ms98-a-0028 160.011875 168.140625 and boy i tell you ha[ppily]- happily i can i can understand just a little bit of Cuban English
sw2624A-ms98-a-0029 168.140625 169.782875 just a little bit
sw2624A-ms98-a-0030 169.782875 172.683750 which was about all i wanted to understand
sw2624A-ms98-a-0031 172.683750 176.705500 uh but i it's amazing because they're they're bilingual
sw2624A-ms98-a-0032 176.705500 183.273875 everything is is Spanish English in Florida and i didn't particularly enjoy it quite frankly
sw2624A-ms98-a-0033 183.273875 201.729375 [silence]
sw2624A-ms98-a-0034 201.729375 202.774625 yes
sw2624A-ms98-a-0035 202.774625 206.408875 [silence]
sw2624A-ms98-a-0036 206.408875 210.439375 that's right and i'm sorry that business
sw2624A-ms98-a-0037 210.439375 215.063875 of making it mandatory i don't like mandatory anything 
sw2624A-ms98-a-0038 215.063875 228.142875 because it just doesn't work all the time it doesn't fit there are circumstances that are different but i do think if you come to America and you're going to live here and you're going to go to our schools and do all of this speak our language
sw2624A-ms98-a-0039 228.142875 240.600125 i really do and it's only fair to the children i think making giving the children an out that they don't have to speak English is just encouraging them to drop out later on because they'll never make it through high school
sw2624A-ms98-a-0040 240.600125 244.846875 and if they do it won't make any difference because there's not a job for them
sw2624A-ms98-a-0041 244.846875 247.164000 [silence]
sw2624A-ms98-a-0042 247.164000 250.590750 that's exactly right and that is the wrong message
sw2624A-ms98-a-0043 250.590750 252.313250 i just
sw2624A-ms98-a-0044 252.313250 255.554625 i don't know i feel so sorry for them but at the same time
sw2624A-ms98-a-0045 255.554625 262.899500 [silence]
sw2624A-ms98-a-0046 262.899500 270.551500 well i would if it were if they were my kids i would so i have to sympathize with the people that come over here and work and send money back 
sw2624A-ms98-a-0047 270.551500 275.375000 you know it's it's right on the survival level and we do what we do to survive
sw2624A-ms98-a-0048 275.375000 314.794250 [silence]
sw2624A-ms98-a-0049 314.794250 319.405125 oh i'm i'm that's that's one on me too i mean
sw2624A-ms98-a-0050 319.405125 326.387250 there are too many children that are just conceived and produced and dropped on society
sw2624A-ms98-a-0051 326.387250 330.443375 without a thought these crack babies
sw2624A-ms98-a-0052 330.443375 331.692250 [silence]
sw2624A-ms98-a-0053 331.692250 333.582000 are so sad
sw2624A-ms98-a-0054 333.582000 360.257750 [silence]
sw2624A-ms98-a-0055 360.257750 362.427250 doesn't make any sense
sw2624A-ms98-a-0056 362.427250 394.002250 [silence]
sw2624A-ms98-a-0057 394.002250 396.633000 well we had
sw2624A-ms98-a-0058 396.633000 403.352750 there there's a little background here but it it builds up to what we're talking about our church had a long
sw2624A-ms98-a-0059 403.352750 404.714500 long
sw2624A-ms98-a-0060 404.714500 408.872125 discussion group and basically the question started out
sw2624A-ms98-a-0061 408.872125 410.219875 [silence]
sw2624A-ms98-a-0062 410.219875 415.759250 that as at the time when there were starving people in India i believe
sw2624A-ms98-a-0063 415.759250 419.307375 and the question was should we save these people
sw2624A-ms98-a-0064 419.307375 422.466500 and our bottom line answer was no
sw2624A-ms98-a-0065 422.466500 425.760375 because we cannot save the world
sw2624A-ms98-a-0066 425.760375 429.960875 we cannot feed the world and we should not please the world 
sw2624A-ms98-a-0067 429.960875 437.115500 [silence]
sw2624A-ms98-a-0068 437.115500 438.399250 this
sw2624A-ms98-a-0069 438.399250 441.115375 and the other thing
sw2624A-ms98-a-0070 441.115375 455.631625 is we can feed them today but they'll be hungry tomorrow what'll we do with them tomorrow do we feed them again tomorrow well how long how long can we continue to feed the world we can't do it are they starving to death yes and that's very sad
sw2624A-ms98-a-0071 455.631625 461.607750 but we cannot save them w[e]- you know okay we can save one 
sw2624A-ms98-a-0072 461.607750 465.272125 and that's good but what's you know
sw2624A-ms98-a-0073 465.272125 472.114125 -[th]at's just back to what you're saying if you want to save somebody there's plenty in the United States that need it to 
sw2624A-ms98-a-0074 472.114125 522.487750 [silence]
sw2624A-ms98-a-0075 522.487750 525.214375 so they're taking the world viewpoint
sw2624A-ms98-a-0076 525.214375 539.781125 [silence]
sw2624A-ms98-a-0077 539.781125 542.096625 um-hum
sw2624A-ms98-a-0078 542.096625 547.349625 [silence]
sw2624A-ms98-a-0079 547.349625 549.547375 but by profession
sw2624A-ms98-a-0080 549.547375 553.423000 i negotiate for Texas Instruments a lot
sw2624A-ms98-a-0081 553.423000 556.738250 and i'm somewhat cynical
sw2624A-ms98-a-0082 556.738250 559.776125 about humans and their behavior
sw2624A-ms98-a-0083 559.776125 561.887375 because i have had
sw2624A-ms98-a-0084 561.887375 565.610625 many interesting examples of human behavior
sw2624A-ms98-a-0085 565.610625 571.564000 when you're talking about money you'd be surprised how human we all get very quickly
sw2624A-ms98-a-0086 571.564000 574.647750 uh-huh um
sw2624A-ms98-a-0087 574.647750 588.322625 [silence]
sw2624A-ms98-a-0088 588.322625 591.586375 uh-huh there you go
sw2624A-ms98-a-0089 591.586375 594.633625 [silence]
sw2624A-ms98-a-0090 594.633625 599.258000 but see that's what happens And the other sad thing i heard about the Kurds
