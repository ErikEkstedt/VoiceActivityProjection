sw2680B-ms98-a-0005 6.458250 11.344125 and i uh made a mistake i went ahead and punched one so we're on

sw2680B-ms98-a-0007 14.427625 19.118125 uh my thinking on the uh uh
sw2680B-ms98-a-0008 19.118125 21.509750 unanimous decision
sw2680B-ms98-a-0009 21.509750 26.763000 i think they should only i think they ought to change that to only in death penalties
sw2680B-ms98-a-0010 26.763000 31.661000 that it be a unan[imous]- unanimous i think in the others they ought to have
sw2680B-ms98-a-0011 31.661000 36.386500 not a majority but say three fourths or something like that
sw2680B-ms98-a-0012 36.386500 39.445750 because too many times they get hung up
sw2680B-ms98-a-0013 39.445750 40.959000 [silence]
sw2680B-ms98-a-0014 40.959000 42.660000 and there's a mistrial

sw2680B-ms98-a-0023 96.386125 99.984875 and uh i'm not so sure that well
sw2680B-ms98-a-0024 99.984875 103.705875 a it would cost a lot more but i'm not so sure that
sw2680B-ms98-a-0025 103.705875 111.117750 life in life without parole is not the stiffer pen[alty]- penalty than the death penalty
sw2680B-ms98-a-0026 111.117750 112.383625 [silence]
sw2680B-ms98-a-0027 112.383625 113.408375 but

sw2680B-ms98-a-0029 118.490375 123.578500 yeah yeah plus it uh it would cost the taxpayers quite a bit more money

sw2680B-ms98-a-0041 202.927750 207.666250 yeah i that's the problem i have with judge giving sentence
sw2680B-ms98-a-0042 207.666250 209.961875 is that there's not consistency
sw2680B-ms98-a-0043 209.961875 210.614625 [silence]
sw2680B-ms98-a-0044 210.614625 212.128125 uh
sw2680B-ms98-a-0045 212.128125 216.811500 it varies even from state to state and even within state
sw2680B-ms98-a-0046 216.811500 221.990375 because i remember i was watching uh i think it was either Hard Copy

sw2680B-ms98-a-0050 240.953375 250.695250 and they prosecuted this guy and fined him like two hundred and fifty thousand dollars or something like that for disturbing water lands
sw2680B-ms98-a-0051 250.695250 254.959500 and he cleaned it up it was even cleaner than when he bought it

sw2680B-ms98-a-0094 405.750750 417.709125 yeah the only one i i got uh not selected but as a as a uh perspective jury member was uh a uh rear end collision
sw2680B-ms98-a-0095 417.709125 424.716500 and of course i guess there was probably thirty people or forty people there and they called them down
sw2680B-ms98-a-0096 424.716500 430.492000 and they asked if anybody had been ever rear ended to hold their hand up and i had
sw2680B-ms98-a-0097 430.492000 432.985750 and uh i think they
