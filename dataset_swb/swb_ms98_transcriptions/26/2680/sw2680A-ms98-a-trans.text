sw2680A-ms98-a-0004 4.697875 5.796375 [silence]
sw2680A-ms98-a-0005 5.796375 7.104375 nice to meet you
sw2680A-ms98-a-0006 7.104375 9.693375 [silence]
sw2680A-ms98-a-0007 9.693375 12.021875 oh okay all righty
sw2680A-ms98-a-0008 12.021875 13.646625 [silence]
sw2680A-ms98-a-0009 13.646625 14.785875 yes
sw2680A-ms98-a-0010 14.785875 27.477875 [silence]
sw2680A-ms98-a-0011 27.477875 28.938625 um-hum

sw2680A-ms98-a-0013 34.806125 36.929250 uh-huh uh-huh
sw2680A-ms98-a-0014 36.929250 38.692875 [silence]
sw2680A-ms98-a-0015 38.692875 41.925500 yes and then there's a mistrial right
sw2680A-ms98-a-0016 41.925500 43.298625 uh-huh
sw2680A-ms98-a-0017 43.298625 49.282250 yeah i agree with that i really do i you know there're two ki[nd]- sides to everything an[d]- and i
sw2680A-ms98-a-0018 49.282250 55.548125 you know i was i've never been on a jury i've been interviewed a couple of times but never got picked and um
sw2680A-ms98-a-0019 55.548125 67.215000 i just really have mixed feelings about it because you know i i'm not sure that i'm for the death penalty and yet when i think if something happened to one of the members of my family if somebody you know killed them or [noise]
sw2680A-ms98-a-0020 67.215000 74.287125 brutally beat them or whatever i uh and killed them i i don't know that i would c[ould]- be be able to say that 
sw2680A-ms98-a-0021 74.287125 83.186000 so you know it's i have mixed feelings so if if i were to ever serve on a jury i would have to be honest about that i'm not sure that i could give somebody the death penalty
sw2680A-ms98-a-0022 83.186000 88.722750 and and so i'm not you know i agree with you i think that uh that um
sw2680A-ms98-a-0023 88.722750 95.669500 a majority for uh you know a less severe case would be okay but i think for a death penalty it would be have to be everybody
sw2680A-ms98-a-0024 95.669500 108.428250 [silence]
sw2680A-ms98-a-0025 108.428250 109.830625 i agree
sw2680A-ms98-a-0026 109.830625 111.226500 [silence]
sw2680A-ms98-a-0027 111.226500 112.429250 uh-huh
sw2680A-ms98-a-0028 112.429250 119.446000 i've always said that i you know i i think that would be the stiffer penalty but we have such a problem with over crowding right now that
sw2680A-ms98-a-0029 119.446000 122.048500 [silence]
sw2680A-ms98-a-0030 122.048500 123.410625 exactly
sw2680A-ms98-a-0031 123.410625 129.363500 exactly and and yet on the other hand you i feel so badly when i see people
sw2680A-ms98-a-0032 129.363500 140.135000 when i read about people in the paper that have gotten out when they've raped somebody or beat somebody or aggravated assault or whatever and they're out in you know a few weeks or a month or
sw2680A-ms98-a-0033 140.135000 147.606125 i think that's criminal because mo[st]- most chances are they'll do it again but they have to let them out in order to make room for other people
sw2680A-ms98-a-0034 147.606125 152.746875 and if you they also mentioned about a judge you know doing the verdict well
sw2680A-ms98-a-0035 152.746875 160.257250 i had an experience with that because my i have a brother-in-law that was um di[d]- made a mistake and he uh
sw2680A-ms98-a-0036 160.257250 173.199500 was working as a financial pla[nner]- planner and they the the company he was working for did a few things that was against the law and the Internal Revenue found you know found out and prosecuted them and he ended up going to jail
sw2680A-ms98-a-0037 173.199500 178.883625 and he's a wonderful man and the bottom line was that he was greedy he money and all that stuff but
sw2680A-ms98-a-0038 178.883625 185.604125 when when he went to jail i saw the the side that i had never seen before because we would go and visit him
sw2680A-ms98-a-0039 185.604125 196.069875 and the judge was the one that was not lenient with him he really throw threw the book at him even though he w[as]- he had so many character witnesses and so many people that that came forth for him and
sw2680A-ms98-a-0040 196.069875 203.322000 he was tough and so sometimes probably the judge might be a little bit more sev[ere]- severe than the jury would
sw2680A-ms98-a-0041 203.322000 205.040125 because don't
sw2680A-ms98-a-0042 205.040125 209.354750 [silence]
sw2680A-ms98-a-0043 209.354750 210.910750 exactly

sw2680A-ms98-a-0051 247.526750 248.827375 oh
sw2680A-ms98-a-0052 248.827375 250.479750 [silence]
sw2680A-ms98-a-0053 250.479750 252.040875 oh my word
sw2680A-ms98-a-0054 252.040875 253.172750 [silence]
sw2680A-ms98-a-0055 253.172750 253.716250 [noise]
sw2680A-ms98-a-0056 253.716250 255.026500 [silence]
sw2680A-ms98-a-0057 255.026500 256.587875 isn't that awful
sw2680A-ms98-a-0058 256.587875 258.999500 [silence]
sw2680A-ms98-a-0059 258.999500 264.994375 yeah and you know i also feel like if a judge has has the last say
sw2680A-ms98-a-0060 264.994375 270.170000 i- i don't care what job you're in you know what social service type job i'm a teacher
sw2680A-ms98-a-0061 270.170000 280.948125 after a while unless you really watch it you begin become hardened to people's problems and they don't quite mean as much to you you detached yourself from them and i think that might happen with judges too
sw2680A-ms98-a-0062 280.948125 293.767250 i think that they they wouldn't be too lenient with certain people because they're they're so hardened to the fact that you know there's a reason why all this happened and they don't want to hear the story anymore they just want them to you know go to jail or be punished
sw2680A-ms98-a-0063 293.767250 298.742125 so i agree with you i'm not too sure i would like to have a judge be the sole
sw2680A-ms98-a-0064 298.742125 302.467375 you know delegate of uh of a a sentence
sw2680A-ms98-a-0065 302.467375 317.954500 [silence]
sw2680A-ms98-a-0066 317.954500 324.700000 yeah and especially and i hate to say this but especially if he's a minority or she's a minority
sw2680A-ms98-a-0067 324.700000 333.264875 uh people have a tendency to automatically sentence people that are Black or or Mexican or any kind of an immigrant before they've even heard
sw2680A-ms98-a-0068 333.264875 335.047375 and that's sad that [laughter]
sw2680A-ms98-a-0069 335.047375 338.864500 oh sad commentary on our times but it happens
sw2680A-ms98-a-0070 338.864500 347.020250 [silence]
sw2680A-ms98-a-0071 347.020250 348.325875 right
sw2680A-ms98-a-0072 348.325875 352.032250 [silence]
sw2680A-ms98-a-0073 352.032250 355.804250 exactly and and the rich people get off the hook [noise]
sw2680A-ms98-a-0074 355.804250 357.986875 it's really is sad
sw2680A-ms98-a-0075 357.986875 362.106375 but have you ever served on a tr[ial]- on a jury
sw2680A-ms98-a-0076 362.106375 364.803000 have you ever served on a jury
sw2680A-ms98-a-0077 364.803000 369.643250 [silence]
sw2680A-ms98-a-0078 369.643250 373.178125 yeah but didn't get selected
sw2680A-ms98-a-0079 373.178125 377.347875 um-hum well i always thought that it would be real interesting but
sw2680A-ms98-a-0080 377.347875 382.800375 one the one one of the ones that i was came down for was had to do with um
sw2680A-ms98-a-0081 382.800375 385.276750 drunken driving and um
sw2680A-ms98-a-0082 385.276750 393.513125 you know i don't think i could be partial in a case like that i ju[st]- i just uh feel like that that you just shouldn't drink and drive and and i
sw2680A-ms98-a-0083 393.513125 397.886625 i could not be lenient at all and they asked me a couple of questions and i think
sw2680A-ms98-a-0084 397.886625 406.421750 you know they came to the conclusion i couldn't you know i would i'd probably throw the book at a person that that harmed somebody drinking and driving so
sw2680A-ms98-a-0085 406.421750 417.344000 [silence]
sw2680A-ms98-a-0086 417.344000 419.011625 row uh-huh
sw2680A-ms98-a-0087 419.011625 424.008375 [noise]
sw2680A-ms98-a-0088 424.008375 425.252500 uh-huh
sw2680A-ms98-a-0089 425.252500 432.262750 [noise]
sw2680A-ms98-a-0090 432.262750 433.877125 right away they
sw2680A-ms98-a-0091 433.877125 436.802500 [silence]
sw2680A-ms98-a-0092 436.802500 437.992250 yeah
sw2680A-ms98-a-0093 437.992250 439.958625 [silence]
sw2680A-ms98-a-0094 439.958625 443.225250 yeah i'm sure that's true i'm sure that's true
sw2680A-ms98-a-0095 443.225250 453.738750 well and it's the law is is very tricky and and we all come from different backgrounds and we come from different experiences and so we bring to that jury
sw2680A-ms98-a-0096 453.738750 460.308375 different perspectives which in a way is good because if we all thought the same way a person that was uh
sw2680A-ms98-a-0097 460.308375 465.295625 possibly innocent or possibly not as guilty as you know as
sw2680A-ms98-a-0098 465.295625 472.123625 as uh you might think would you know get the book thrown at them or whatever because we're all we all feel the same way but
sw2680A-ms98-a-0099 472.123625 477.864500 i know th[at]- i have some friends that have been on juries that have been deadlocked and it's no fun i mean because
sw2680A-ms98-a-0100 477.864500 479.423875 [silence]
sw2680A-ms98-a-0101 479.423875 480.675375 no
sw2680A-ms98-a-0102 480.675375 484.797000 [silence]
sw2680A-ms98-a-0103 484.797000 496.503000 that's right and especially hard on the people that are not along going along with the majority because the [laughter-the] the other jurors get so angry because they want to go on with their life they want to get out of there 
sw2680A-ms98-a-0104 496.503000 502.232625 and if you don't truly believe what you think and stick to your guns it can be awful uncomfortable
sw2680A-ms98-a-0105 502.232625 503.473000 so
sw2680A-ms98-a-0106 503.473000 512.094875 [silence]

sw2680A-ms98-a-0109 518.283875 520.545375 so which is g[reat]- is great
sw2680A-ms98-a-0110 520.545375 530.588750 [silence]
sw2680A-ms98-a-0111 530.588750 534.551875 oh wouldn't that be awful yeah that would be terrible
sw2680A-ms98-a-0112 534.551875 542.915875 [silence]
sw2680A-ms98-a-0113 542.915875 545.258125 exactly yeah
sw2680A-ms98-a-0114 545.258125 548.738500 you're right you're right and we just kind of have to
sw2680A-ms98-a-0115 548.738500 559.104125 to go along with it and do the best job we can if we're called it is a duty a lot of people i know try to get out of jury duty when they're [vocalized-noise] you know and i would never do that because i feel like hey we live in a country
sw2680A-ms98-a-0116 559.104125 568.672875 where we have this you know privilege and i would never that's my duty to be as a citizen of the United States and if i got called i'd do it but some people don't feel that way
sw2680A-ms98-a-0117 568.672875 578.020250 [silence]
sw2680A-ms98-a-0118 578.020250 585.817500 oh gosh isn't that awf[ul]- that'd be awful um yeah we're lucky to live in the United States there's no doubt about it
sw2680A-ms98-a-0119 585.817500 587.097000 [silence]
sw2680A-ms98-a-0120 587.097000 590.659000 but let's see i really don't have anything else to say about jury and
sw2680A-ms98-a-0121 590.659000 592.500500 [silence]
sw2680A-ms98-a-0122 592.500500 596.586500 okay well it was good to talk to you all right
