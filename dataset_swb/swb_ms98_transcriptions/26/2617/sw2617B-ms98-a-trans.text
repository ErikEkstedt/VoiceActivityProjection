sw2617B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.845500 [noise]
sw2617B-ms98-a-0002 0.845500 7.367750 uh i have uh i guess a lot of thoughts about the Vietnam War um
sw2617B-ms98-a-0003 7.367750 16.997125 i i guess i feel like i was pretty young while it was going on and so there's probably a lot of things i remember and a lot of things that i really didn't have a clue as to what was happening
sw2617B-ms98-a-0004 16.997125 29.063875 um looking back like maybe some of the things that i know now i i'm not sure i do believe it was worth the cost in dollars and lives that was one of the questions that she asked us to think about because i
sw2617B-ms98-a-0005 29.063875 36.014625 because we never went to war i don't think we were committed to winning it and getting out and i i feel like it went on and on
sw2617B-ms98-a-0006 36.014625 46.424125 and i i guess i see such a contrast like as opposed to the Middle East War we just had where President Bush went out and got worldwide support for for what was happening
sw2617B-ms98-a-0007 46.424125 51.767250 you know i just feel like maybe we went in to be policeman and i'm not sure that's our role
sw2617B-ms98-a-0008 51.767250 52.898250 but
sw2617B-ms98-a-0009 52.898250 77.259625 [silence]
sw2617B-ms98-a-0010 77.259625 87.934625 don't you think that maybe that's why we had it this time i mean i do think that i- i- it's been too long in coming but i feel like maybe the American people and
sw2617B-ms98-a-0011 87.934625 93.183625 and and the government are aware of the things that we did wrong that we didn't support that
sw2617B-ms98-a-0012 93.183625 102.502125 that those so many people were opposed to the war what it translated into was they were opposed to the folks that were there fighting it and those guys were there doing their duty
sw2617B-ms98-a-0013 102.502125 103.853250 [silence]
sw2617B-ms98-a-0014 103.853250 115.823250 yeah and i i think that we learned from that and i think it it's one of those things that you learn the hard way it was a tragic mistake the way that they have been treated over the years and i believe that's just now 
sw2617B-ms98-a-0015 115.823250 125.667000 turning around Just now you know trying to be rectified and i'm and i'm not sure you can undo the damage that was done emotionally on so many of the people
sw2617B-ms98-a-0016 125.667000 147.915500 [silence]
sw2617B-ms98-a-0017 147.915500 149.565375 no they're not
sw2617B-ms98-a-0018 149.565375 153.246125 [silence]
sw2617B-ms98-a-0019 153.246125 154.635875 yeah
sw2617B-ms98-a-0020 154.635875 157.697250 [silence]
sw2617B-ms98-a-0021 157.697250 164.438500 well i i appreciate the fee[l]- i feel like President Bush is in a hard spot he went over there to get them out of Kuwait
sw2617B-ms98-a-0022 164.438500 165.994125 which he did
sw2617B-ms98-a-0023 165.994125 179.757000 and then he has backed out he has pulled out and i realize they're still saying well here you're encouraging us to get rid of Saddam Hussein so why aren't you helping us and you see i think him going in and doing that would be putting us in another Vietnam situation
sw2617B-ms98-a-0024 179.757000 186.279625 and i don't think the US will stand for it i don't think he would do that uh i think we learned too much
sw2617B-ms98-a-0025 186.279625 191.763125 of the effects uh you know whether it was justified or not i know
sw2617B-ms98-a-0026 191.763125 202.611625 that they probably felt like we were going in for a good cause i i feel like maybe they felt like we were doing the right thing to try and help maintain the democracy over there and and beat the communism but
sw2617B-ms98-a-0027 202.611625 209.961500 but i think somewhere that got lost you know in the long term effects of the of the war and
sw2617B-ms98-a-0028 209.961500 218.489000 [silence]
sw2617B-ms98-a-0029 218.489000 219.565125 [noise]
sw2617B-ms98-a-0030 219.565125 220.783375 yeah
sw2617B-ms98-a-0031 220.783375 228.451250 [silence]
sw2617B-ms98-a-0032 228.451250 229.716625 yeah
sw2617B-ms98-a-0033 229.716625 238.596375 [silence]
sw2617B-ms98-a-0034 238.596375 240.431875 that we don't get fixed
sw2617B-ms98-a-0035 240.431875 242.123000 i know
sw2617B-ms98-a-0036 242.123000 244.225125 [silence]
sw2617B-ms98-a-0037 244.225125 252.658125 and i i believe that we have to have a military and i believe that we have to have a defense to keep anybody else from walking in and doing it to us
sw2617B-ms98-a-0038 252.658125 256.205375 but i also believe that we need to turn so much of that inward
sw2617B-ms98-a-0039 256.205375 267.678125 [silence]
sw2617B-ms98-a-0040 267.678125 268.743250 [noise]
sw2617B-ms98-a-0041 268.743250 275.083000 [silence]
sw2617B-ms98-a-0042 275.083000 287.154500 i know i do think that in the Middle East war um i think that maybe a lot of the Arab countries that were so hateful towards the United States have come away with uh kind of a different attitude
sw2617B-ms98-a-0043 287.154500 290.554625 uh i think that maybe we're not their big bad enemy any more
sw2617B-ms98-a-0044 290.554625 293.880625 and uh and i think that's good you know i think that's a good
sw2617B-ms98-a-0045 293.880625 295.246750 [silence]
sw2617B-ms98-a-0046 295.246750 296.943375 i think so too
sw2617B-ms98-a-0047 296.943375 310.411375 [silence]
sw2617B-ms98-a-0048 310.411375 316.003125 and perhaps the reason that good came out of the Mid East war is because we had the experience of Vietnam
sw2617B-ms98-a-0049 316.003125 318.981875 so i i i do think that
sw2617B-ms98-a-0050 318.981875 320.715375 we've learned from it
sw2617B-ms98-a-0051 320.715375 323.922000 you know i i i wish there weren't war [laughter]
sw2617B-ms98-a-0052 323.922000 326.897625 but uh i do think we learned
sw2617B-ms98-a-0053 326.897625 330.875125 [silence]
sw2617B-ms98-a-0054 330.875125 331.891875 yes
sw2617B-ms98-a-0055 331.891875 337.931375 [silence]
sw2617B-ms98-a-0056 337.931375 342.355000 no there was no feeling of accomplishment no goal no
sw2617B-ms98-a-0057 342.355000 347.867750 we went in but what did we do we lost lives and and what were we trying to do who knows
sw2617B-ms98-a-0058 347.867750 351.337250 and i i think you're right uh
sw2617B-ms98-a-0059 351.337250 353.175000 i think you're right there
sw2617B-ms98-a-0060 353.175000 357.739750 um i do remember when it was over i remember when they were coming home
sw2617B-ms98-a-0061 357.739750 359.385625 uh
sw2617B-ms98-a-0062 359.385625 360.778375 but
sw2617B-ms98-a-0063 360.778375 361.934500 [silence]
sw2617B-ms98-a-0064 361.934500 368.091750 i remember the feeling back then you know like i feel like right now i feel like this country has been behind this war
sw2617B-ms98-a-0065 368.091750 372.197750 uh yeah there's a lot of people that aren't for war i'm not for war
sw2617B-ms98-a-0066 372.197750 379.247500 but i believe that the way that it was done and the way that was handled were right i don't remember that feeling back in Vietnam
sw2617B-ms98-a-0067 379.247500 387.234125 i just remember oh yeah our guys are over there and it's sad and we shouldn't be fighting a war but there was no let's support them you know
sw2617B-ms98-a-0068 387.234125 391.371000 [silence]

sw2617B-ms98-a-0075 413.733125 414.968625 that's right
sw2617B-ms98-a-0076 414.968625 416.538125 [silence]
sw2617B-ms98-a-0077 416.538125 419.688625 they don't see it as supporting the folks the people
sw2617B-ms98-a-0078 419.688625 422.761625 [silence]
sw2617B-ms98-a-0079 422.761625 425.248000 i would agree with you there [laughter]
sw2617B-ms98-a-0080 425.248000 426.677375 i i agree
sw2617B-ms98-a-0081 426.677375 440.300375 um and i and i recall when President Bush said that you know he said look he said i you know i'm sorry that you're opposed to the war there's a lot of us that are opposed to war but uh you're not helping the people that are over there by what you're doing and i remember a lot of it kind of stopped after that 
sw2617B-ms98-a-0082 440.300375 441.325125 but
sw2617B-ms98-a-0083 441.325125 442.778500 [silence]

sw2617B-ms98-a-0090 452.042500 452.700500 [noise]
sw2617B-ms98-a-0091 452.700500 459.819750 but well i just i i'm glad we've learned i'm sorry we had the experience of Vietnam
sw2617B-ms98-a-0092 459.819750 468.159625 and uh and i'm i'm i'm especially sorry for the people that are you know have spent all these years trying to deal with it emotionally because
sw2617B-ms98-a-0093 468.159625 473.734000 you know until the la[st]- past four or five years nobody ever really worried about that for them
sw2617B-ms98-a-0094 473.734000 479.713125 and and i think that's where we as American people really failed you know failed them
sw2617B-ms98-a-0095 479.713125 481.055250 so
sw2617B-ms98-a-0096 481.055250 482.784250 i don't know
