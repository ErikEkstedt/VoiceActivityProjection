sw2617A-ms98-a-0009 52.009125 59.344875 i i agree with that i was i was fairly young at the time too i i really don't have very many memories about it at all 
sw2617A-ms98-a-0010 59.344875 69.186000 in fact and uh my husband is a Vietnam veteran and i- you know he in looking at the Persian Gulf war that just went on he 
sw2617A-ms98-a-0011 69.186000 77.629500 i- it frustrates him because of the support that they have and the support that the Vietnam vets did not have from the people or the administration either one

sw2617A-ms98-a-0020 124.981125 138.200250 no i don't think you can and i i agree with you that i i think that the the time difference between the two wars has allowed a lot of people to see the mistakes that were made in in in every aspect of it
sw2617A-ms98-a-0021 138.200250 148.664500 and i i agree with you also that i feel like it was not worth the money spent or the lives lost to fight that war i mean they're still not settled over there
sw2617A-ms98-a-0022 148.664500 153.812375 and i have a feeling that the Persian Gulf crisis is going to be the same way
sw2617A-ms98-a-0023 153.812375 158.027125 i think we're going to end up back there in a few years or if if not sooner

sw2617A-ms98-a-0035 210.126250 222.463500 well you have to i- you know you have to give Bush a lot of credit for he he said that's what we were going there to do and he did what what he said and he did pull out before it got any further than that where where it would have turned into more of a police action
sw2617A-ms98-a-0036 222.463500 230.353250 uh or more of a political action i guess you getting into their governmental affairs which you really can't do as as another country
sw2617A-ms98-a-0037 230.353250 231.513625 i mean th[at]-
sw2617A-ms98-a-0038 231.513625 239.578625 my my biggest problem with all of these wars is we spend all of that money on all these other countries and we have so many problems here at home that we don't address
sw2617A-ms98-a-0039 239.578625 244.100625 that's right and and tha[t's]- that's what frustrates me more than anything

sw2617A-ms98-a-0043 256.027875 264.332875 i think there's a lot of waste and and they don't i- if they could just cut out all the fat and and get it lean
sw2617A-ms98-a-0044 264.332875 275.862875 and start addressing some of the other issues i think we could take care of everything and quit taking care of all these other countries all across the world you know who just end up using things against us later on anyway

sw2617A-ms98-a-0050 293.318625 296.261375 yeah a lot of good has come from this one
sw2617A-ms98-a-0051 296.261375 311.140875 and i think i guess in in uh ironic way a lot of good came from the Vietnam war toward this war because like we we said earlier that you know the a lot of eyes were opened after years and years of of that war and and
