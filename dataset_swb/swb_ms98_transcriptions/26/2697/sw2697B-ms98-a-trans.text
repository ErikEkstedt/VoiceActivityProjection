sw2697B-ms98-a-0003 1.996750 3.004625 [silence]
sw2697B-ms98-a-0004 3.004625 5.493875 well um
sw2697B-ms98-a-0005 5.493875 14.784375 we we do but not an official one i mean basically we know we have i- i think i'm a little crazy in that we keep so many different savings accounts
sw2697B-ms98-a-0006 14.784375 19.236375 we'll have our checking account that's just the the money that we use and spend
sw2697B-ms98-a-0007 19.236375 30.965500 and then we have a savings account which is money where we work our credit cards in such a way that we charge everything and then we write it out like it was a check
sw2697B-ms98-a-0008 30.965500 41.634875 so we're nev[er]- we pay off our bills in full we're not paying any interest but it's not a big surprise if we get a large bill because we have it all written out already
sw2697B-ms98-a-0009 41.634875 49.996000 and then we have another checking acc[ount]- another savings account which is like for heavy duty savings you know that's just taken out of our paychecks every week
sw2697B-ms98-a-0010 49.996000 57.498875 and then we have a a fourth sort of CD type arrangement um where you know it's in a CD and we can't get to it
sw2697B-ms98-a-0011 57.498875 71.996750 so i guess our budget is just what's in our checkbook we don't say we have x amount for entertainment x amount for gas it's just we know some weeks we might be able to go out for dinner two times some weeks one time some weeks three times
sw2697B-ms98-a-0012 71.996750 77.182500 um so there's nothing really that we have written down for a budget
sw2697B-ms98-a-0013 77.182500 86.739875 but i'm a saver i would rather if i had twenty extra dollars i would rather save it than spend it and that's my philosophy and um
sw2697B-ms98-a-0014 86.739875 97.221000 sometimes i- i you know i think that that's not necessarily the best way to live but i- i always think that you're going to need it for a rainy day you know how about_1 you

sw2697B-ms98-a-0035 159.484000 162.441625 um-hum yeah that's wonderful
sw2697B-ms98-a-0036 162.441625 163.504500 [silence]
sw2697B-ms98-a-0037 163.504500 169.614125 one nice thing that my company does um and i know this is going on all over the country but
sw2697B-ms98-a-0038 169.614125 173.840500 they allow you to put into um a certain fund
sw2697B-ms98-a-0039 173.840500 185.470375 whatever you think some of your major medical expenses are going to be for the year such as any prescriptions um if you wear glasses or contacts any expenses you might have for that
sw2697B-ms98-a-0040 185.470375 198.670625 any dental expenses you anticipate if you have kids day care that sort of thing um outside of a major medical hospitalization problem anything that that might be medically related
sw2697B-ms98-a-0041 198.670625 203.976125 and so you claim that amount at the beginning of the year let's say you determine that's five hundred dollars
sw2697B-ms98-a-0042 203.976125 213.004750 they'll withhold five hundred dollars from your paycheck um broken up into fifty two weeks so whatever that is divided by fifty two
sw2697B-ms98-a-0043 213.004750 219.320000 and w[hat]- what in in a sense happens is you end up paying those bills in pretax dollars
sw2697B-ms98-a-0044 219.320000 221.255250 do you have something like that
sw2697B-ms98-a-0045 221.255250 224.334125 [silence]
sw2697B-ms98-a-0046 224.334125 230.997625 it's really wonderful in our case we don't have that many medical expenses thank God and so i only claim two hundred dollars
sw2697B-ms98-a-0047 230.997625 235.797875 so i my salary in a sense was lowered by two hundred dollars
sw2697B-ms98-a-0048 235.797875 244.313500 and they break that up into three dollars and eighty five cents a week that's taken out automatically and then if i go and get my teeth cleaned for thirty dollars
sw2697B-ms98-a-0049 244.313500 257.373625 i pay the thirty dollars and then i send it in to the it's Blue Choice i send it in to them and then they send me a check back for thirty dollars but the nice thing is that that thirty dollars i wasn't taxed on
sw2697B-ms98-a-0050 257.373625 266.751750 initially because_1 it it almost looked like i never made that thirty dollars and it's really wonderful if i this is the first year we did it and uh next year
sw2697B-ms98-a-0051 266.751750 276.444250 i i'm just going to claim a lot more if you don't spend it all then you do lose it but i feel we could have benefitted from even two hundred dollars more from it
sw2697B-ms98-a-0052 276.444250 289.992500 but uh it's a nice little savings account and then they they tell you if you'd like you can put the money that you save by not paying taxes into a savings account and they'll do like what you mentioned about matching it and that sort of thing
sw2697B-ms98-a-0053 289.992500 291.490125 but um
sw2697B-ms98-a-0054 291.490125 293.500750 [silence]
sw2697B-ms98-a-0055 293.500750 302.038875 yes if you don't lose it so if you decided to claim or or put aside five hundred dollars and you only spent four fifty
sw2697B-ms98-a-0056 302.038875 312.740125 they let you know each quarter and they'll let you know you have three hundred dollars left two hundred dollars left but if it gets to be the end of the year and you haven't spent that fifty then you do lose it
sw2697B-ms98-a-0057 312.740125 314.284250 [silence]
sw2697B-ms98-a-0058 314.284250 320.043625 yeah right [laughter] or just buy a new set of glasses or [laughter] or whatever
sw2697B-ms98-a-0059 320.043625 327.497500 but i- i don't know how people can really live on a budget our i mean a budget that's really written out
sw2697B-ms98-a-0060 327.497500 339.722750 um you know this amount of dollars because you your life just fluctuates so much and i mean each week is so different some weeks you're just going to go over that and some weeks you're going to go under and so to me it's just easier to
sw2697B-ms98-a-0061 339.722750 341.244250 i don't know
sw2697B-ms98-a-0062 341.244250 343.713250 [silence]
sw2697B-ms98-a-0063 343.713250 346.491000 yeah that's true that's true

sw2697B-ms98-a-0072 361.983375 370.469000 well you you know some people look at their their credit card limit as a loan in a sense and they um
sw2697B-ms98-a-0073 370.469000 377.788500 you know if their limit is twenty five hundred dollars if they have a hundred left they'll spend that because they think they have it
sw2697B-ms98-a-0074 377.788500 382.991000 and then will just end up paying interest for the rest of their lives practically
sw2697B-ms98-a-0075 382.991000 384.011375 [silence]
sw2697B-ms98-a-0076 384.011375 385.995750 yeah it really is

sw2697B-ms98-a-0083 396.804625 405.726500 and you know they send these applications out to college kids and college kid gets an application that says you've been approved for this amount of credit
sw2697B-ms98-a-0084 405.726500 408.797250 [vocalized-noise] automatic approval
sw2697B-ms98-a-0085 408.797250 412.765875 and they get them and then these kids start charging and
sw2697B-ms98-a-0086 412.765875 421.745000 and they get themselves into some deep trouble before they [laughter-even] start making money they're already in debt [laughter-you] [laughter-know] let alone loans and stuff 
sw2697B-ms98-a-0087 421.745000 423.724000 but
sw2697B-ms98-a-0088 423.724000 431.463875 [silence]
sw2697B-ms98-a-0089 431.463875 437.147000 well it'll be a long time before that's something we can retire on but um
sw2697B-ms98-a-0090 437.147000 448.211125 it's yeah it's just uh something that's automatically taken out of our paychecks each week and uh it goes for an emergency we had a disastrous storm here about seven weeks ago and
sw2697B-ms98-a-0091 448.211125 456.191000 Rochester was in a state of emergency for three weeks and everyone lost their power and we had to pay over five hundred dollars to have a tree removed
sw2697B-ms98-a-0092 456.191000 468.274500 and it wasn't covered by insurance so that's something where y[ou]- you don't plan on it's not something that you can you know you're not saving for a trip or whatever it's boom here it is
sw2697B-ms98-a-0093 468.274500 477.031000 and you just have to pay for it so it's an emergency fund but when we got married we you know obviously got some money and that that's what's put in the CD
sw2697B-ms98-a-0094 477.031000 484.685875 and to me i- i try and forget that we even have that because i don't want to think about that um
sw2697B-ms98-a-0095 484.685875 497.998375 but it would be nice to just not always think about saving like have a have a twenty dollar bill and think oh maybe we'll just go out and buy something with this and it'll come
sw2697B-ms98-a-0096 497.998375 499.995625 [silence]
