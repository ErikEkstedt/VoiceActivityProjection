sw2697A-ms98-a-0021 96.775125 101.733500 well we're very very similar we i have worked
sw2697A-ms98-a-0022 101.733500 105.202625 for a goal of saving three months' salary
sw2697A-ms98-a-0023 105.202625 109.464875 and and we put that uh in a account
sw2697A-ms98-a-0024 109.464875 120.996375 and we just leave it there that's our emergency account if the car breaks down i mean we can take money out of that but you know then our goal after the next month is to rebuild it up to three months' salary
sw2697A-ms98-a-0025 120.996375 125.151750 now we've only we've recently done that so now we have extra money
sw2697A-ms98-a-0026 125.151750 136.796250 we don't have to slap in that account so we're looking into mutual funds or uh just uh common stock you know anything like that that we can get a higher return on our money
sw2697A-ms98-a-0027 136.796250 150.764500 uh see we do have the checking account we have Carla works for TI so she has a CODA plan you know where she puts in if they put in a dollar sh[e]- she puts in a dollar you know TI pays fifty cents
sw2697A-ms98-a-0028 150.764500 158.482000 it's sort of like a matching fund then she gets like eight percent interest on top of that so that's been uh
sw2697A-ms98-a-0029 158.482000 161.715500 pretty juicy for last couple of years

sw2697A-ms98-a-0067 339.705125 351.214375 well there again we both have the natural tendency to save and like so if we have the extra money we're going to slap it away as opposed to someone else who goes out and blows it
sw2697A-ms98-a-0068 351.214375 359.737500 so for those people that are in debt like you said you pay your credit card off at the end of the month and so do we because_1 i hate interest
sw2697A-ms98-a-0069 359.737500 362.994250 so i mean but some people don't care about interest

sw2697A-ms98-a-0076 385.265125 388.742750 yeah credit cards are good if you use them correctly
sw2697A-ms98-a-0077 388.742750 391.705500 but they can be very dangerous if you don't
