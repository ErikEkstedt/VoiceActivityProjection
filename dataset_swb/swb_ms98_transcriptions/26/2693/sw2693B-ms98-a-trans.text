sw2693B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 2.590750 [noise]
sw2693B-ms98-a-0002 2.590750 12.429125 well it'll be real easy for us because we're both my husband and i are vegetarians so yeah so that's the first thing we look for is if we can eat there or not
sw2693B-ms98-a-0003 12.429125 14.107625 [silence]
sw2693B-ms98-a-0004 14.107625 27.616375 we're not vegan vegetarians we do we're {ovolacto} we do eat uh eggs and and milk products i used to be a complete vegan vegetarian where i didn't eat any animal products at all
sw2693B-ms98-a-0005 27.616375 39.162500 but um it was it's really difficult in the area if you don't have you know the products that you can get and if you go out to dinner there's virtually you know there's not a whole lot of things you can get
sw2693B-ms98-a-0006 39.162500 42.197125 [silence]
sw2693B-ms98-a-0007 42.197125 56.022000 yeah i think maybe if you were somewhere like California where they have a lot more vegetarian restaurants and stuff but here basically you go to an Italian restaurant or you go to a Mexican restaurant you know where you can get foods that
sw2693B-ms98-a-0008 56.022000 63.185125 you know where you have a little bit more variety as far as the pastas or the the corn meal you know or something
sw2693B-ms98-a-0009 63.185125 64.020375 but
sw2693B-ms98-a-0010 64.020375 65.199125 [silence]
sw2693B-ms98-a-0011 65.199125 77.688125 yeah yeah you have to watch that too all you know some of the restaurants here they will you know like you can ask them and they'll tell you whether or not they use like lard or you know animal fat to cook with
sw2693B-ms98-a-0012 77.688125 89.588125 so but so that's that we don't really eat out too much we we tend to eat at home and actually you know i think we we we get a ha[ve]- we have a healthier diet than the average person
sw2693B-ms98-a-0013 89.588125 91.138375 [silence]
sw2693B-ms98-a-0014 91.138375 104.435625 um i've been a vegetarian for uh two years now my husband has been one for oh just over a year now and uh so
sw2693B-ms98-a-0015 104.435625 105.895875 [silence]
sw2693B-ms98-a-0016 105.895875 114.066000 definitely and it it makes you more aware of what you're eating because you you have to be i mean you you [vocalized-noise] i think you
sw2693B-ms98-a-0017 114.066000 126.832375 you you balance the foods uh you know you're more aware of what nutrient you know value each thing has and minerals and you're just more aware of food for energy for energy sake
sw2693B-ms98-a-0018 126.832375 129.749375 [silence]
sw2693B-ms98-a-0019 129.749375 144.534250 well that's just it you you do have to figure it out and and you know to get proteins and things and when i was a vegan it's you know you have to consider calcium and iron and things like that you you're not even getting through your milk products your egg products
sw2693B-ms98-a-0020 144.534250 146.271375 [silence]
sw2693B-ms98-a-0021 146.271375 154.981500 if you don't eat any of those but actually you can get everything you need through vegetables i mean there are [vocalized-noise] there are there are you actually you can get more calcium through
sw2693B-ms98-a-0022 154.981500 163.635000 leafy green vegetables than you can get through milk products a lot of people don't know that well the thing is that milk products our bodies don't uh
sw2693B-ms98-a-0023 163.635000 176.226125 don't uh the the lactose that kind of milk it doesn't our we we tend to uh what's it called we don't synthesize the the calcium the same way 
sw2693B-ms98-a-0024 176.226125 182.516625 yeah we we slough some of it we we send we send some of it out because it our body doesn't accept some of it
sw2693B-ms98-a-0025 182.516625 190.786000 so we're not utilizing we're when it when it gets rid of some of that um that we can't use it get rids it gets rid of some of the calcium
sw2693B-ms98-a-0026 190.786000 198.497625 whereas we eat say broccoli you utilize all of it you utili[ze]- your your body accepts all of the broccoli
sw2693B-ms98-a-0027 198.497625 207.049250 so it's like it's like say a person using vitamins as opposed to uh vitamin supplements as opposed to eating regular food
sw2693B-ms98-a-0028 207.049250 211.967125 your body just doesn't accept vitamins and the minerals in the the vitamins in
sw2693B-ms98-a-0029 211.967125 224.351500 uh supplements that it does in regular food you know so but we both we both feel much healthier much healthier and i couldn't consider going back to eating
sw2693B-ms98-a-0030 224.351500 225.468125 [vocalized-noise]
sw2693B-ms98-a-0031 225.468125 230.070750 yeah well now i changed for ethical reasons and my husband
sw2693B-ms98-a-0032 230.070750 234.528625 has changed he feels more ethically about it but he
sw2693B-ms98-a-0033 234.528625 237.660750 he in the beginning began for health reasons
sw2693B-ms98-a-0034 237.660750 239.193000 but um
sw2693B-ms98-a-0035 239.193000 242.501250 now he he feels like i do that
sw2693B-ms98-a-0036 242.501250 249.301125 he looks at the things that he eats and he realizes [laughter-what] [laughter-they] [laughter-are] before he eats them and he you know
sw2693B-ms98-a-0037 249.301125 250.330250 [silence]
sw2693B-ms98-a-0038 250.330250 256.406875 yeah plus he eats we both think more about i thought more of about it as far as what it was i was eating
sw2693B-ms98-a-0039 256.406875 268.462875 you know as far as a living creature and now we both think a lot of well what is it we're eating in relation to what it's going to give to our bodies too so
sw2693B-ms98-a-0040 268.462875 271.481500 um-hum yeah

sw2693B-ms98-a-0046 287.393625 299.089500 that's the way i and i believe you me it wasn't easy to [laughter-give] [laughter-up] to give up a hamburger that that was one of my favorite foods was was a was a good steak or a hamburger but
sw2693B-ms98-a-0047 299.089500 302.758125 you know i suppose if you really believe in something it's
sw2693B-ms98-a-0048 302.758125 310.717625 you you adjust your life because your mind you your you inside yourself you just it's not right
sw2693B-ms98-a-0049 310.717625 314.004375 so but um
sw2693B-ms98-a-0050 314.004375 315.709375 [silence]

sw2693B-ms98-a-0064 371.625125 375.039000 as opposed to like a cafeteria kind of
sw2693B-ms98-a-0065 375.039000 376.407250 situation yeah
sw2693B-ms98-a-0066 376.407250 380.691375 [silence]
sw2693B-ms98-a-0067 380.691375 392.977500 well no i don't think so i think it's just your because i i prefer to be waited on too i just if you're going to go out to eat why not have the whole service you know why why not get the whole
sw2693B-ms98-a-0068 392.977500 397.292375 i guess because we don't go out that much i feel like it's a treat
sw2693B-ms98-a-0069 397.292375 398.597250 yeah
sw2693B-ms98-a-0070 398.597250 403.200375 [silence]

sw2693B-ms98-a-0077 433.234250 439.295125 you order a meal you order their dinner meal and it's like they're trying to find out how much you can eat or or
sw2693B-ms98-a-0078 439.295125 440.956125 [laughter]
sw2693B-ms98-a-0079 440.956125 452.175125 or or like evidently people go in there and they're not satisfied that they'd been given enough and they complain and maybe they're afraid that people are going to complain or something i

sw2693B-ms98-a-0083 486.245500 493.989125 nobody's going to restrain what you [laughter-eat] [laughter-the] [laughter-amount] [laughter-that] [laughter-you] [laughter-eat] and i think that peo[ple]- that we just tend to eat overeat yeah

sw2693B-ms98-a-0107 575.495625 583.776250 yeah that's one thing that i wish we had more of uh because where we're from it's it's pretty limited and it's most of the restaurants are
sw2693B-ms98-a-0108 583.776250 591.170750 oh they tend to be you know American style food and we don't have too many wh[ere]- you have to go all the way to Dallas
sw2693B-ms98-a-0109 591.170750 600.068750 and so really is a treat because uh you know we don't make a trip sixty five eighty you know sixty five to eighty miles depending how far in Dallas it is
