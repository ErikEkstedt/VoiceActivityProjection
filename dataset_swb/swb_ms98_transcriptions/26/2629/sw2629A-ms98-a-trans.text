sw2629A-ms98-a-0148 457.454500 465.249625 oh she's my best friend and when when i lived in Orlando she uh got paralyzed from her waist down and uh waist
sw2629A-ms98-a-0149 465.249625 467.153125 and i thought it was uh
sw2629A-ms98-a-0150 467.153125 475.239500 uh we almost had to put her to sleep and i just cried for two days but i think what i- i- i ironically what happened was she g[ot]- had fleas
sw2629A-ms98-a-0151 475.239500 480.116625 and i think it was the stuff i was ha[ving]- putting on her that that paralyzed her but
sw2629A-ms98-a-0152 480.116625 489.581000 the fleas i think's what brought her back is she had to scratch so bad that she started using her paraly[zed]- the the doctor was just amazed at a that she came back because
sw2629A-ms98-a-0153 489.581000 499.509875 he really was going to was going to do surgery for fifteen hundred dollars or put her to sleep and i was going to have to opt to have to put her to sleep even as mu[ch]- much as i loved her i wasn't going to spend fifteen hundred dollars on an experiment
sw2629A-ms98-a-0154 499.509875 502.049375 [silence]
sw2629A-ms98-a-0155 502.049375 514.377750 no but it was just uh that spot that they put on the back of a dog uh they used to use it on cattle and uh so i started using it on her and i'd take to her to the vet once a month and get that spot put on her
sw2629A-ms98-a-0156 514.377750 519.427000 and she wouldn't have any fleas never had any fleas hadn't never any then all of a sudden uh i took her
sw2629A-ms98-a-0157 519.427000 526.598625 i was living in Orlando and i p[ut]- i put her in the vet f[or]- while i came home to Dallas for a while and i took and when i picked her up she had fleas again
sw2629A-ms98-a-0158 526.598625 533.932875 and so my daughter came down and visited m[e]- me from Dallas and and while she was there the dog got paralyzed
sw2629A-ms98-a-0159 533.932875 536.221625 and so i took her back up to the doctor and
sw2629A-ms98-a-0160 536.221625 539.796875 anyway he he said it wasn't that but
sw2629A-ms98-a-0161 539.796875 548.798125 another doctor told me that there had been uh people the pet owners had been getting permanently paralyzed from petting the dogs that had that spot on them_1
sw2629A-ms98-a-0162 548.798125 555.535875 so i thought well a[nd]- so i can't find a vet that'll do that for me anymore put the spot on her anymore and i don't want it anymore anyway
sw2629A-ms98-a-0163 555.535875 558.542500 but i do fight fleas oh gosh
