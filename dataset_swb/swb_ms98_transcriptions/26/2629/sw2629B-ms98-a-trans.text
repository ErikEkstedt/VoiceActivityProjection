sw2629B-ms98-a-0002 0.667250 5.916500 what i was doing a[t]- at home in fact i work at nights here so that's another long story we'll talk about
sw2629B-ms98-a-0003 5.916500 7.869375 it's funny that i got you though
sw2629B-ms98-a-0004 7.869375 9.386000 uh
sw2629B-ms98-a-0005 9.386000 17.382000 i asked my wife to hand me the other phone because_1 i was just i was busy and uh i had just gotten a call and i couldn't answer it and i said well i'll punch it on this one
sw2629B-ms98-a-0006 17.382000 24.874625 and uh it's a walk around phone but it's not a uh it's not the other kind you know
sw2629B-ms98-a-0007 24.874625 26.417125 so it didn't work
sw2629B-ms98-a-0008 26.417125 27.564250 [silence]
sw2629B-ms98-a-0009 27.564250 29.006000 okay
sw2629B-ms98-a-0010 29.006000 32.687875 no i'm using a regular phone now uh
sw2629B-ms98-a-0011 32.687875 38.517125 if if it's a what kind of phone do they ta[lk]- it['s]- not a dial but if it's a touchtone it's okay
sw2629B-ms98-a-0012 38.517125 43.680125 i realized that once i used i should have i was going to go in the kitchen and and punch one on the touchtone
sw2629B-ms98-a-0013 43.680125 46.500250 and i realized that i had screwed it up so it was my fault
sw2629B-ms98-a-0014 46.500250 48.437500 that's funny that we had gotten it
sw2629B-ms98-a-0015 48.437500 53.190125 uh [vocalized-noise] i guess they want us to talk about dogs but dogs or cats
sw2629B-ms98-a-0016 53.190125 54.518500 [silence]
sw2629B-ms98-a-0017 54.518500 60.068250 i'll switch over to birds you know we we don't really have birds as pets but we sure because we have cats
sw2629B-ms98-a-0018 60.068250 65.530375 we always wind up with i haven't yet uh
sw2629B-ms98-a-0019 65.530375 73.229750 a bird or two in the Summer because the cat will catch one and usually we'll catch the cat because_1 the cat doesn't seem to kill the bird right away
sw2629B-ms98-a-0020 73.229750 76.384250 we wound up with a lot of birds over the years and
sw2629B-ms98-a-0021 76.384250 84.000000 there are organizations we drop ours off at Fort Worth if they're still alive and you keep it alive which is hard to do for a couple of weeks
sw2629B-ms98-a-0022 84.000000 95.978250 if you take it to an agency they'll send it back in the wild somehow and so we we wound up because of our cats with with many birds over the years uh again they're not pets exactly but uh
sw2629B-ms98-a-0023 95.978250 102.350875 [silence]
sw2629B-ms98-a-0024 102.350875 103.448000 yeah
sw2629B-ms98-a-0025 103.448000 107.977750 [silence]
sw2629B-ms98-a-0026 107.977750 111.350000 the lady next door a[cross]- f[rom]- across the street from us just lost
sw2629B-ms98-a-0027 111.350000 114.147250 is it a cockatoo what's that one that's white
sw2629B-ms98-a-0028 114.147250 119.391000 it got loose and i've forgotten what how she did it and she had it in a cage of some sort
sw2629B-ms98-a-0029 119.391000 127.561000 and what they were doing i don't know but it flew away you know and they called it and everything and r[ode]- drove around the neighborhood looking for it but uh
sw2629B-ms98-a-0030 127.561000 130.018125 yeah it's free [laughter-yeah]
sw2629B-ms98-a-0031 130.018125 137.947500 i'm surprised that a bird uh i guess they can find their way back but i wonder exactly where a tame bird would go
sw2629B-ms98-a-0032 137.947500 138.962500 [silence]
sw2629B-ms98-a-0033 138.962500 148.405125 no no she never got it back i've heard stories like this before with parrots and all this uh because_1 people let them_1 out out in their house you know and fly around
sw2629B-ms98-a-0034 148.405125 149.594375 and
sw2629B-ms98-a-0035 149.594375 151.495125 [silence]
sw2629B-ms98-a-0036 151.495125 154.057375 no i know uh
sw2629B-ms98-a-0037 154.057375 165.319750 but uh i've forgotten she had it outside somehow and somehow they they mixed signals or something and uh it got loose of course a[gain]- again the animals are so much faster than we are in one way or the other
sw2629B-ms98-a-0038 165.319750 173.935500 uh you know i was telling you the story about fencing i do like dogs i i would i've always had dogs my whole life as a kid
sw2629B-ms98-a-0039 173.935500 174.949750 [silence]
sw2629B-ms98-a-0040 174.949750 176.697125 uh
sw2629B-ms98-a-0041 176.697125 179.330875 well yeah i do i
sw2629B-ms98-a-0042 179.330875 186.388125 yeah i do i think that all the animals have personality i'm not the cat person i my sister had cats when we were little
sw2629B-ms98-a-0043 186.388125 191.320250 we always seem to have a cat and a dog together which again when you bring them_1 up i do notice that
sw2629B-ms98-a-0044 191.320250 193.134250 they get along
sw2629B-ms98-a-0045 193.134250 201.050750 and my wife was the cat lover and w[hen]- when we started out as a y[oung]- young married couple we just had an apartment so y[ou]- it's kind of easier to have a cat
sw2629B-ms98-a-0046 201.050750 206.617125 and then she just never wanted a dog and then we got here to Texas uh she's from Texas again and uh
sw2629B-ms98-a-0047 206.617125 210.618625 sh[e]- she had this thing with the fence and i i guess i have so many
sw2629B-ms98-a-0048 210.618625 215.487375 interests i don't really quite have the time with with two daughters and everything
sw2629B-ms98-a-0049 215.487375 224.596875 and all the activities to personally train a dog but i would i would i guess i'll have to wait -[un]til both of my kids are out of college before i get another dog [laughter-again] [laughter-i] [laughter-guess] [laughter-i'm] [laughter] 
sw2629B-ms98-a-0050 224.596875 229.338625 i- i i certainly saw your point with the Greyhound that there's there is a limit
sw2629B-ms98-a-0051 229.338625 232.280875 uh to a pet um
sw2629B-ms98-a-0052 232.280875 235.207250 [silence]
sw2629B-ms98-a-0053 235.207250 236.686875 um-hum
sw2629B-ms98-a-0054 236.686875 268.222500 [silence]
sw2629B-ms98-a-0055 268.222500 269.505875 yeah

sw2629B-ms98-a-0058 283.180500 286.988250 [silence]
sw2629B-ms98-a-0059 286.988250 296.324375 yeah no i think so too uh my wife just she keeps convincing me because_1 my my parents uh my parents are dead now but my parents and my brothers and sisters always had dogs
sw2629B-ms98-a-0060 296.324375 301.714750 and when we would visit them she said you can smell dog over the house i said well you're really right
sw2629B-ms98-a-0061 301.714750 307.300375 and so i never she always had a good argument why not to get a dog and we haven't since we've been married
sw2629B-ms98-a-0062 307.300375 314.540875 [silence]
sw2629B-ms98-a-0063 314.540875 316.992875 y[eah]- oh yeah yeah
sw2629B-ms98-a-0064 316.992875 319.239750 [silence]
sw2629B-ms98-a-0065 319.239750 326.851000 uh no y[eah]- i think you're right uh people are surprisingly are allergic to cats too we do have some friends on and off that will
sw2629B-ms98-a-0066 326.851000 335.568875 i guess it's the hai[r]- the cat the short fur on the cat is uh one of the allergic reaction things like uh
sw2629B-ms98-a-0067 335.568875 343.664250 cedar trees and all of the other stuff i guess the cat has a real fine not the that the real short hair dandruff or whatever they have that people do get allergic to cats uh
sw2629B-ms98-a-0068 343.664250 348.840375 in their eyes you know they just walk in the house even though we lock up the cats and they're crying
sw2629B-ms98-a-0069 348.840375 352.821875 and so some people unfortunately of course i wouldn't have an animal if i was allergic to it either
sw2629B-ms98-a-0070 352.821875 356.567875 uh my wife at one time said she was allergic to them_1 uh
sw2629B-ms98-a-0071 356.567875 358.373250 i was going to say a stor[y]-
sw2629B-ms98-a-0072 358.373250 363.924250 [silence]
sw2629B-ms98-a-0073 363.924250 369.177875 well i think the animal's good for you just because uh it gets you out and everything i uh
sw2629B-ms98-a-0074 369.177875 372.728500 [silence]
sw2629B-ms98-a-0075 372.728500 374.089625 oh yeah

sw2629B-ms98-a-0081 391.028500 395.522500 i have some friends uh uh that have horses you know
sw2629B-ms98-a-0082 395.522500 401.917625 and when my daughters were a little younger you know i thought well maybe that's a good maybe i'll get them_1 uh you know this is Texas and i'll get them_1 a horse
sw2629B-ms98-a-0083 401.917625 406.715500 well we went over and we rode their horses and everything but and and just listened to the stories and the money
sw2629B-ms98-a-0084 406.715500 409.135750 the horse was sick all the time
sw2629B-ms98-a-0085 409.135750 416.403250 y[ou]- i don't know if you if you have any friends with horses but they get all kinds of eating disorders if they don't if they don't eat the right grain or if you
sw2629B-ms98-a-0086 416.403250 423.946250 if you give him an orange or something you nearly kill it i mean it the the stories he would tell it must have cost him a couple hundred dollars a month
sw2629B-ms98-a-0087 423.946250 432.802000 of course he had several horses for shots and different things i thought my God and i just saw something interesting Consumer Reports they talked they had a a[nimals]- animals and they compared 
sw2629B-ms98-a-0088 432.802000 438.437250 you know whether you should have a bird and and the pricing and it had a comment around a horse something to the effect of
sw2629B-ms98-a-0089 438.437250 444.234500 you don't even want to know what it cost to keep a horse [laughter-you] [laughter-know] [laughter] and i
sw2629B-ms98-a-0090 444.234500 448.209875 right i think the best thing in the world is to rent them i think that uh
sw2629B-ms98-a-0091 448.209875 454.515500 tha[t]- that and boats are probably the same way i'd love to have a boat too but i think uh i'm not too sure i i would get that much use out of it you know
