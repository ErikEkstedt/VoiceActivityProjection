sw2619A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.448125 [noise]
sw2619A-ms98-a-0002 1.448125 9.080500 well um what [laughter] what do you think about the metric system uh do you uh find it usable have you tried much with it
sw2619A-ms98-a-0003 9.080500 10.683125 [silence]
sw2619A-ms98-a-0004 10.683125 12.062875 yeah
sw2619A-ms98-a-0005 12.062875 13.271625 [silence]
sw2619A-ms98-a-0006 13.271625 17.088125 um-hum to use you mean uh-huh
sw2619A-ms98-a-0007 17.088125 21.081625 [silence]
sw2619A-ms98-a-0008 21.081625 22.474500 yes
sw2619A-ms98-a-0009 22.474500 26.402250 [silence]
sw2619A-ms98-a-0010 26.402250 27.598125 yes
sw2619A-ms98-a-0011 27.598125 30.261625 [silence]
sw2619A-ms98-a-0012 30.261625 34.785125 um-hum um-hum well i've i've lived
sw2619A-ms98-a-0013 34.785125 47.014000 both in the United States and and in a country where they do use the metric system and uh so i've i've lived with pounds and inches and found it really quite easy to convert over um
sw2619A-ms98-a-0014 47.014000 55.491750 the secret seeming to me is to be to not bother ever converting inches to centimeters and pounds to kilom[eters]-
sw2619A-ms98-a-0015 55.491750 64.909000 uh kilograms and i think that's what hung people up the most is they went now wait a minute an inch is two point fifty four centimeters how on earth am i every going to do the math
sw2619A-ms98-a-0016 64.909000 76.403875 and the problem is that we tried to convert everything from inches to centimeters preserving basically the inches but expressing them as centimeters rather than saying no a centimeter is about the width of your thumbnail or whatever and
sw2619A-ms98-a-0017 76.403875 78.681375 you know [laughter] and leaving it at that
sw2619A-ms98-a-0018 78.681375 89.743500 and uh you know a kilogram weighs about this much and get used to it from scratch cause i still can't convert back and forth from inches to centimeters but i'm perfectly comfortable using either
sw2619A-ms98-a-0019 89.743500 102.528375 and i think the real problem with this this weird conversion you see signs that say fifty five miles per hour and you know whatever it would be one hundred six kilometers per hour you know people you know it's hard to take it seriously
sw2619A-ms98-a-0020 102.528375 112.468125 and as long as both were given you basically just don't read the kilometers per hour you just say well look read the miles per hour one the other one must be for someone else
sw2619A-ms98-a-0021 112.468125 118.918125 uh i don't know i mean even Britain has converted over and we inherited this mess from them and uh
sw2619A-ms98-a-0022 118.918125 124.700375 [laughter] well i mean it's more our fault than theirs at this point because they they saw the light
sw2619A-ms98-a-0023 124.700375 133.798125 um i don't know why they we[re]- um were more able than we were except i think that they probably just said well we're just going to start using the things now
sw2619A-ms98-a-0024 133.798125 137.962125 and you sort of have to force people to change since they don't want to
sw2619A-ms98-a-0025 137.962125 138.575375 [noise]
sw2619A-ms98-a-0026 138.575375 147.165000 [silence]
sw2619A-ms98-a-0027 147.165000 158.409750 that's true that's that's probably true and America does have a long history of sort of doing things our own way [laughter] rather than adopting you know some other model
sw2619A-ms98-a-0028 158.409750 160.379375 [silence]
sw2619A-ms98-a-0029 160.379375 168.659625 [laughter] i've never heard that one that's very nice [laughter]
sw2619A-ms98-a-0030 168.659625 181.625000 oh so i'm all for the metric system and converting over and i think i guess my feeling is the way to do it is is to just start giving weights you know have a very brief transition period and then just start giving weights and kilometers
sw2619A-ms98-a-0031 181.625000 186.858875 or just as in kilometers and weights and kilograms and everything like that and uh
sw2619A-ms98-a-0032 186.858875 194.330000 just have people start using it rather than having people constantly trying to convert remember me getting a package of something that said one pound
sw2619A-ms98-a-0033 194.330000 206.901000 is a package of dates mind you it's was presumably something you weigh fairly precisely it said one pound [noise] and then in parenthesis it said four hundred and fifty four point six grams [laughter] 
sw2619A-ms98-a-0034 206.901000 219.781250 [laughter] and as near as i could tell seeing that was basically {antimetric} propaganda cause anyone who would say well look i can either buy a pound of something at four hundred sixty four point six grams which of course they couldn't weigh it out accurately anyway um
sw2619A-ms98-a-0035 219.781250 224.737375 every time i see something like that i think well that's that's an {antimetric} argument
sw2619A-ms98-a-0036 224.737375 229.346500 [silence]
sw2619A-ms98-a-0037 229.346500 230.673625 you don't
sw2619A-ms98-a-0038 230.673625 234.950250 [silence]
sw2619A-ms98-a-0039 234.950250 236.822500 um-hum um-hum
sw2619A-ms98-a-0040 236.822500 240.621875 [silence]
sw2619A-ms98-a-0041 240.621875 251.959000 yeah oh oh that's what i was thinking by quick transition i didn't mean you know i didn't mean like Sweden going over to right hand drive or anything you know [laughter] at midnight tonight we all switch over or anything
sw2619A-ms98-a-0042 251.959000 259.283500 uh i believe so yeah and i think they did it overnight cause you know you can't do it gradually [laughter] that's an example of something you can't do gradually
sw2619A-ms98-a-0043 259.283500 265.218875 yes it does [laughter] a quantum leap from left to right hand drive [laughter]
sw2619A-ms98-a-0044 265.218875 277.367375 [laughter] and they but you know that must have taken uh that was something that had to be done quickly you know because of external circumstances but they decided to do it to make themselves in sync with the rest of Europe or the rest of continental Europe and
sw2619A-ms98-a-0045 277.367375 283.099250 you know but that must have been tremendously difficult to orchestrate um
sw2619A-ms98-a-0046 283.099250 290.962375 so i- i- i- i- i think it's essential that it's done and i think the real trick is to avoid the [noise]
sw2619A-ms98-a-0047 290.962375 301.587000 you know a little more attention to human psychology and whereas people want round numbers and after all the whole reason to go over to metric is to have round numbers so they don't deal with thirty seconds of an inch and so what the exact
sw2619A-ms98-a-0048 301.587000 308.422000 the thing that was best about metric was the thing that was most poorly represented really i think
sw2619A-ms98-a-0049 308.422000 309.667125 [silence]
sw2619A-ms98-a-0050 309.667125 316.255250 uh-huh i saw that i saw that the other day i don['t]- don't drink soda pop but i saw a two liter soda pop bottle so yeah things like that
sw2619A-ms98-a-0051 316.255250 322.125375 are a good start and if you start expressing one liters and one kilograms and then the
sw2619A-ms98-a-0052 322.125375 331.314375 pounds come in the the you know the odd numbers you know [laughter] two point two pounds or something i think people will start getting a sense of gee the metric is the sensible one
sw2619A-ms98-a-0053 331.314375 333.187250 [silence]
sw2619A-ms98-a-0054 333.187250 339.720750 yes well get back to what you're doing and i'll do the same i enjoyed talking with you too [laughter] okay bye-bye
