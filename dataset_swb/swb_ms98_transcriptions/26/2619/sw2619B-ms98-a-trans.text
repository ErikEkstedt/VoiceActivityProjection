sw2619B-ms98-a-0002 8.208125 14.027875 well wi[th]- with an engineering degree it's of course it's a whole lot easier
sw2619B-ms98-a-0003 14.027875 15.587375 because uh
sw2619B-ms98-a-0004 15.587375 22.200375 yeah if if somebody ha[d]- is totally unfamiliar with it uh human nature being what it is we don't like to change
sw2619B-ms98-a-0005 22.200375 26.992250 uh it just m[akes]- absolutely makes perfectly good sense to me because it's all decimal
sw2619B-ms98-a-0006 26.992250 30.989875 and it's so easy to convert from one set of units to another
sw2619B-ms98-a-0007 30.989875 53.413375 [silence]
sw2619B-ms98-a-0008 53.413375 54.925750 right
sw2619B-ms98-a-0009 54.925750 56.104375 [silence]
sw2619B-ms98-a-0010 56.104375 57.501750 that's right
sw2619B-ms98-a-0011 57.501750 62.501625 [silence]
sw2619B-ms98-a-0012 62.501625 65.313500 right right
sw2619B-ms98-a-0013 65.313500 88.945750 [silence]
sw2619B-ms98-a-0014 88.945750 90.333625 uh-huh
sw2619B-ms98-a-0015 90.333625 101.245750 [silence]
sw2619B-ms98-a-0016 101.245750 102.634625 oh yeah
sw2619B-ms98-a-0017 102.634625 111.129375 [silence]
sw2619B-ms98-a-0018 111.129375 112.610750 that's right
sw2619B-ms98-a-0019 112.610750 117.219750 [silence]
sw2619B-ms98-a-0020 117.219750 119.436625 that's right it's all their fault
sw2619B-ms98-a-0021 119.436625 136.992000 [silence]
sw2619B-ms98-a-0022 136.992000 147.711625 of course being part of the European community if everybody else did it they they were probably much more is much more necessary for them than for us
sw2619B-ms98-a-0023 147.711625 154.102375 [silence]
sw2619B-ms98-a-0024 154.102375 155.642000 w[ell]-
sw2619B-ms98-a-0025 155.642000 161.536250 uh there's an expression for that with eyes on the past backing confidently into the future
sw2619B-ms98-a-0026 161.536250 205.666250 [silence]
sw2619B-ms98-a-0027 205.666250 208.404125 right right
sw2619B-ms98-a-0028 208.404125 224.391125 [silence]
sw2619B-ms98-a-0029 224.391125 230.047250 yep well i- i don't think it'll it could ever happen with with a quick transition
sw2619B-ms98-a-0030 230.047250 235.753125 no i- i think that would be the easiest way but human nature being such as it is
sw2619B-ms98-a-0031 235.753125 241.840500 i would think it would take probably two or three years before people cou[ld]- could completely cut the cord
sw2619B-ms98-a-0032 241.840500 250.510250 [silence]
sw2619B-ms98-a-0033 250.510250 252.297875 did they switch
sw2619B-ms98-a-0034 252.297875 256.730500 [silence]
sw2619B-ms98-a-0035 256.730500 260.224625 well that's true it it has to be kind of a discreet transaction
sw2619B-ms98-a-0036 260.224625 265.949500 [laughter]
sw2619B-ms98-a-0037 265.949500 266.963250 interesting
