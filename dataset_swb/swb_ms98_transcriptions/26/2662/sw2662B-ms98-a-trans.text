sw2662B-ms98-a-0011 60.007875 66.012000 um let's see well [laughter] um this is almost sort of funny i was just at um
sw2662B-ms98-a-0012 66.012000 71.029750 friend and i went to see Out for Justice which is uh Steven Seagal
sw2662B-ms98-a-0013 71.029750 77.486000 [noise] because uh we're both big karate fans so we wanted to see what this is like and uh wasn't very impressed with actually
sw2662B-ms98-a-0014 77.486000 85.527250 yeah i wasn't i mean i['ve]- i've seen his other movies and he i- i just think he's pretty good but uh this movie it's just i'm convinced now he can't act so
sw2662B-ms98-a-0015 85.527250 96.564750 oh his hi[s]- hi[s]- his karate's been pretty good i think in this one it wasn't so good i generally um movies like that scare me though i'd i'd be just fine without them because you know kids come running out wanting to beat each other up and y[ou]-
sw2662B-ms98-a-0016 96.564750 97.842750 fighting

sw2662B-ms98-a-0020 105.477250 106.845875 right
sw2662B-ms98-a-0021 106.845875 110.115875 [silence]
sw2662B-ms98-a-0022 110.115875 114.934125 yeah yeah well that that was number one for the week actually too so
sw2662B-ms98-a-0023 114.934125 117.700625 so it was a little bit uh i was thinking wow people must be
sw2662B-ms98-a-0024 117.700625 117.738000 [silence] 
sw2662B-ms98-a-0025 117.738000 119.341875 into crime movies again
sw2662B-ms98-a-0026 119.341875 126.931125 but but in the middle of that conversation we sort of picked an um an an interesting point last year's number one movie for the year was Ghost
sw2662B-ms98-a-0027 126.931125 128.659375 i don't know if you saw Ghost or not
sw2662B-ms98-a-0028 128.659375 135.953500 except yeah and and and that was that that helped us sort of feel good about you know about ourselves and about that everyone around us in that
sw2662B-ms98-a-0029 135.953500 144.909750 in that um at least at least if everyone['s]- if if if everyone's running around seeing karate movies and stuff like that at least they're still going to see the real good movies you know
sw2662B-ms98-a-0030 144.909750 148.917875 [silence]
sw2662B-ms98-a-0031 148.917875 150.183625 yeah

sw2662B-ms98-a-0033 151.327250 154.833500 yeah it was it was i was absolutely enthralled by it
sw2662B-ms98-a-0034 154.833500 157.357125 [silence]
sw2662B-ms98-a-0035 157.357125 159.263125 oh Patrick Swayze
sw2662B-ms98-a-0036 159.263125 160.890500 [silence]
sw2662B-ms98-a-0037 160.890500 163.042875 yeah he['s]- he's very good
sw2662B-ms98-a-0038 163.042875 168.827625 [silence]
sw2662B-ms98-a-0039 168.827625 174.563125 really i'm trying to think what else i've seen recently <b_aside> what else have we seen recently <e_aside> oh you know what's pretty cute actually
sw2662B-ms98-a-0040 174.563125 176.306125 um Defending Your Life
sw2662B-ms98-a-0041 176.306125 178.365000 have you have you heard of this
sw2662B-ms98-a-0042 178.365000 185.274625 yeah um i actually hadn't heard anything about it and some friends called up and said do you want to go see this movie
sw2662B-ms98-a-0043 185.274625 195.032625 and and they said it starred um Meryl Streep and Mel Brooks at first they told me and i thought what a strange combination Mel Brooks and Meryl Streep [vocalized-noise]
sw2662B-ms98-a-0044 195.032625 197.921750 well actually it starred out that it that it's actually Albert Brooks
sw2662B-ms98-a-0045 197.921750 208.370375 so [laughter] so it's lot better um M[el]- Mel Brooks you you probably know is uh you know so i[t]- it was a strange combination but it turned out to be a very cute movie i mean the whole premise is that they go out and they they die
sw2662B-ms98-a-0046 208.370375 210.693875 and and they have to
sw2662B-ms98-a-0047 210.693875 222.050125 right both of them are dead and they happen to meet in this this town um this this sort of city where you're set up such that you know they go and they decide if you can move up to the next level
sw2662B-ms98-a-0048 222.050125 236.145500 i don't know if you've ever read Jonathan Livingston Seagull but it's something like that it's something like that they sort of move up to levels and and they have to decide whether or not they're good enough and as it turns out you know it's uh they meet there and fall in love and stuff like that
sw2662B-ms98-a-0049 236.145500 243.596625 so you can guess the rest of the plot it actually it's it's really funny because they run through you know they do it they have them do is sit down and see scenes of their lives
sw2662B-ms98-a-0050 243.596625 246.014875 and that's pretty good actually
sw2662B-ms98-a-0051 246.014875 256.246500 yeah and it oh that's that's what you do you actually have to go up there and you have a they have an attorney for you know attorney for you and attorney a a a defense and a prosecution and they have the
sw2662B-ms98-a-0052 256.246500 265.204375 you know the prosecutor's job is to make sure you don't move up a level and the defense's job is to make sure that you you do you know and it's uh it's a neat little story actually
sw2662B-ms98-a-0053 265.204375 272.565750 i was i wa[s]- i was i i w[ent]- i went in thinking it'll be okay not great and then i actually came away thinking it was really pretty good so
sw2662B-ms98-a-0054 272.565750 280.709375 [silence]
sw2662B-ms98-a-0055 280.709375 282.005750 yeah

sw2662B-ms98-a-0061 308.404500 317.617875 well i'm i'm i'm sure because_1 it seems like it certainly would w[ould]- would explain the preoccupation with it lately i mean but i suspect there's always been a preoccupation with that sort of thing in movies
sw2662B-ms98-a-0062 317.617875 324.966375 [silence]
sw2662B-ms98-a-0063 324.966375 326.583875 right well

sw2662B-ms98-a-0068 333.485750 336.849625 that that's probably one of those ones that you know
sw2662B-ms98-a-0069 336.849625 349.964625 i[t's]- it's on video now i think and it's probably probably worth seeing on video um actually we really enjoyed it but it was it was it was also right along the same lines i mean they they would go ahead and kill themselves for a few three or four minutes to see what happens and
sw2662B-ms98-a-0070 349.964625 356.520625 [silence]
sw2662B-ms98-a-0071 356.520625 361.480875 almost yeah i i i[t's]- i[t's]- it's a little far fetched to find a bunch of medical students doing it but
sw2662B-ms98-a-0072 361.480875 371.115500 but it was um it was it was odd enough you know and th[e]- and they didn't just sort of make it silly it was you know it was done fairly well i think so actu[ally]- i actually enjoyed that as well
sw2662B-ms98-a-0073 371.115500 372.483875 okay_1
sw2662B-ms98-a-0074 372.483875 380.324500 [silence]
