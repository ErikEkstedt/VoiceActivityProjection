sw2662A-ms98-a-0034 164.541875 170.935625 other than that Dances with Wolves seems like to be the the only thing i've seen in the past several months to have any uh

sw2662A-ms98-a-0062 279.302625 289.911375 uh after life i guess and it kind of makes you wonder i'm a also besides working at TI i'm a graduate student at here North Texas and working on a master's in communication
sw2662A-ms98-a-0063 289.911375 297.437375 it's the behavioral science part of [communercation/communication] and i i i think about these things and and people trying to define their own world view
sw2662A-ms98-a-0064 297.437375 305.032375 and uh wh[at]- what exactly do we you know do we see about this world or why are we so fascinated with the other world is it just supposed to be better
