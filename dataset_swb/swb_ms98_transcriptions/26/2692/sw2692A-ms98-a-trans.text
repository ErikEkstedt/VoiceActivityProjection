sw2692A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.682750 are you a TIer
sw2692A-ms98-a-0002 1.682750 2.979250 oh good
sw2692A-ms98-a-0003 2.979250 10.337250 yeah uh she had a hard time getting a few folks uh i thought well every all these TIers have gone home uh at one o'clock on Friday
sw2692A-ms98-a-0004 10.337250 12.273875 [laughter]
sw2692A-ms98-a-0005 12.273875 17.531750 [silence]
sw2692A-ms98-a-0006 17.531750 23.051875 i i i do it a lot i have i kind of worked my way through college as a mechanic as a kid
sw2692A-ms98-a-0007 23.051875 24.515875 uh
sw2692A-ms98-a-0008 24.515875 34.158500 so and my father and brother were in it and and my brother's still in it and i had periods when i didn't do anything but in the last ten years i've
sw2692A-ms98-a-0009 34.158500 49.123250 uh my car doesn't go to a shop you know it it i just do it all do i uh there's hardly anything that other than putting tires on that i'll do i did take it to a transmission place to put in a new transmission but i change the oil and transmission and
sw2692A-ms98-a-0010 49.123250 54.127625 uh uh i just essentially do it all i don't know uh
sw2692A-ms98-a-0011 54.127625 64.568125 uh if there's anything specific in fact i could advise people uh i happen to be a M E besides but i do it for fun really and to save money and i guess that's diversion uh
sw2692A-ms98-a-0012 64.568125 77.327375 i i've i've tried a few groups uh you know where you i can recommend it for people to take their cars Like i think Sears is probably the best place because i've heard when i used to go there
sw2692A-ms98-a-0013 77.327375 84.989500 and when i i just overheard what they did for me very little because i didn't take it that much but what i heard them tell other people was always right
sw2692A-ms98-a-0014 84.989500 88.650000 you know when i sat there i you know i dropped my car off for tires or something like that
sw2692A-ms98-a-0015 88.650000 92.935125 and so i respect they seem to actually have mechanics there
sw2692A-ms98-a-0016 92.935125 96.045875 i was pretty impressed with Western Auto
sw2692A-ms98-a-0017 96.045875 107.451000 but they didn't do a great job of changing my transmission uh oil last time and when when i did it the next time i realized the filter was loose and everything and i didn't like it So i'm just doing it all myself i i
sw2692A-ms98-a-0018 107.451000 114.600875 [silence]
sw2692A-ms98-a-0019 114.600875 116.683000 you had to do it yeah right

sw2692A-ms98-a-0038 186.006000 198.123500 yeah i wonder always wonder when you have little things like that happen why even here at TI why we don't inspect i'm in facilities why we don't inspect areas and and guarantee it so to speak uh
sw2692A-ms98-a-0039 198.123500 207.135250 we always fix things and [vocalized-noise] put things in and walk away we there needs to be a time of inspection and check out and and some thing like that with a car there ought to be someone there
sw2692A-ms98-a-0040 207.135250 221.095500 that inspects it before it's turned there ought to be an insp[ector]- inspector or quality insurance guy after after an oil change you know just in case uh they didn't put the oil in or whatever you know i i always wonder about that when when someone does repairs or little things like that uh 
sw2692A-ms98-a-0041 221.095500 232.991250 [silence]

sw2692A-ms98-a-0048 257.062500 268.794250 you need to really uh i i do uh a lot of the simple things i i think i do most of the things better than the average person you you have Fords and i i uh i have three Chevys which
sw2692A-ms98-a-0049 268.794250 280.567625 i worked my way into having the same engine i don't know how long i'm i like a V8 and i'm i'm s[old]- sold on small block Chevy V8s and i i bought one car new and i almost accidentally
sw2692A-ms98-a-0050 280.567625 285.139250 got the next car although i was kind of looking for it when i got a u[sed]- a used car with the same engine
sw2692A-ms98-a-0051 285.139250 297.277125 well then the nex[t]- the truck i got next i definitely looked for the same engine so i buy filters you know three or four at a time and essentially the engines are different you the cars are different years but the same Chevy V8
sw2692A-ms98-a-0052 297.277125 310.081875 and the part the carburetors is the same almost everything is the same the the course is two are eighties and one eighty six you know so you can learn a lot that way i there's no way i could i could fix every car in the world you know

sw2692A-ms98-a-0088 426.687750 437.405625 did you get it inside or outside i i took one off my little Buick i had and i pretty much took it loose on the inside but it came out from the you know underneath the hood it came from yeah
sw2692A-ms98-a-0089 437.405625 441.568125 [silence]
sw2692A-ms98-a-0090 441.568125 445.814750 maybe you're right maybe you're right i it's been a long time since i took one out

sw2692A-ms98-a-0092 447.684375 448.769125 course
sw2692A-ms98-a-0093 448.769125 454.295250 i broke mine you know so i'm always very careful when i change hoses on it i don't know whether you did yours
sw2692A-ms98-a-0094 454.295250 458.133250 not to really pull on those i when i take those hoses i cut them off
sw2692A-ms98-a-0095 458.133250 468.040375 very gingerly because if you you know pull on that and i've always done that as a kid you know just yanked on it and they must have been stronger and heavier copper at the time
sw2692A-ms98-a-0096 468.040375 475.299500 but i broke one on my on my Buick and i always remembered it was my own fault and i thought well i'm going to to going to carefully take those hoses off
sw2692A-ms98-a-0097 475.299500 482.464625 [silence]
sw2692A-ms98-a-0098 482.464625 484.153750 oh really yeah

sw2692A-ms98-a-0106 506.849500 510.533500 sometimes if you're a tinkerer you luck out My wife's
sw2692A-ms98-a-0107 510.533500 518.382125 uh Chevy uh it was a Caprice air conditioning stopped i i just heard it i realized that the air conditioning wasn't cutting in
sw2692A-ms98-a-0108 518.382125 530.913125 and i went out there for five minutes and i just pushed on the wires And sure enough just pure dumb luck that the connection over by it's not the evaporator the big filter on one side
sw2692A-ms98-a-0109 530.913125 533.605250 i just pushed that in and i heard it click
sw2692A-ms98-a-0110 533.605250 545.318625 and so sometimes you have dumb luck i i was you know you could have taken something like that and thought well the compressor's not working or it would have taken me all day probably if i didn't do that but sometimes you have some dumb luck If you have a little curiosity
sw2692A-ms98-a-0111 545.318625 558.571625 and you have enough knowledge to check things out i know i feel bad for people who just when anything goes wrong a fuse you know they just have to take it And i know that's tough if you don't uh at least give it a shot i've got girls daughters and
sw2692A-ms98-a-0112 558.571625 572.243250 i've always said i'd teach them And my my one daughter was fairly interested And i really haven't gotten around to i learned because i i just uh learned you know and i feel bad about not at least showing them some of the things And i'm going to do that i i told my daughters in college this year
sw2692A-ms98-a-0113 572.243250 575.481000 i said This summer we're definitely going to spend a little more time on the car i said
sw2692A-ms98-a-0114 575.481000 577.741625 so you can learn the basics you know

sw2692A-ms98-a-0120 593.243875 597.170250 i have the there's one expression i don't like uh
sw2692A-ms98-a-0121 597.170250 599.959125 the country expression you know if it ain't if it ain't broke don't fix it
