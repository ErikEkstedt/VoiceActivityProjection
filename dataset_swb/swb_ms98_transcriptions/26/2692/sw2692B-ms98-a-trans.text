sw2692B-ms98-a-0028 118.719500 129.845250 i've done various things i've got an i've got an eighty three T Bird and i've i've changed out uh heater core and uh oh timing belts and things like that um
sw2692B-ms98-a-0029 129.845250 131.925625 i guess the last thing i took 
sw2692B-ms98-a-0030 131.925625 144.715875 to anybody to have done was on my wife's car um when we went in for inspection it didn't it didn't quite pass so we had to have uh that's uh that's a Mustang with a two barrel carburetor on it
sw2692B-ms98-a-0031 144.715875 154.957500 they had to do some adjustments on that and of course it had never been adjusted so they had to pull it off and pull all the plugs out to get to it and uh
sw2692B-ms98-a-0032 154.957500 169.076000 yeah yeah i've uh i'm kind of stuck on them right now i guess but [laughter] you know that's it's partially because i can work on them that's uh that's that's that's a big part of my decision but uh yeah we ran into some problems with uh
sw2692B-ms98-a-0033 169.076000 175.283750 having them to work on that carburetor i mean they get they got everything tuned up right you know but they we got i got it home and uh
sw2692B-ms98-a-0034 175.283750 186.899500 and they had left the uh oil f[ilter]- uh cap off and it was rubbing on a belt and it rubbed a notch in that li[ttle]- little things like that that really start to aggravate you that that's a lot of the reason i do my own stuff

sw2692B-ms98-a-0045 223.371625 238.054125 gets to be an an assembly line type operation you're you're always risking that if there's too many people that get their hands on one little project you know that things they're you get y[ou]- you miss that overlap sometimes and and and they miss things yeah i've i've had a hard time 
sw2692B-ms98-a-0046 238.054125 241.071000 finding anybody i can trust like like you say it
sw2692B-ms98-a-0047 241.071000 245.479000 my old transmissions things like that i'm obviously i'm not going to i'm not going to tear apart a
sw2692B-ms98-a-0048 245.479000 247.795750 automatic transmission try rebuild it
sw2692B-ms98-a-0049 247.795750 257.081875 but uh it it's it's real stressful to try to find anybody that i think's going to do me right and and uh you know have an idea of what's going on

sw2692B-ms98-a-0068 309.040875 317.859375 well yeah that that the biggest you know that's the three biggest things to me you know i- i number one you've got to have the tools around if you don't have the the special tools or
sw2692B-ms98-a-0069 317.859375 326.377750 well any more the the testers that you know [laughter] i i don't have a forty thousand dollar diagnostic tester sitting in my garage you know so obviously if it starts
sw2692B-ms98-a-0070 326.377750 338.713875 my car start missing or something like that th[at]- it's almost impossible to track that down any more without a diagnostics but at the tools and the space to do it that that can be a big problem if it's if it's under carriage or something like that but
sw2692B-ms98-a-0071 338.713875 347.278750 then it's experience you know you can you can look through a a Chilton's book or something like that and get an idea of how to go about it but 
sw2692B-ms98-a-0072 347.278750 351.618750 you better figure on multiplying that time out about by at least by five or so
sw2692B-ms98-a-0073 351.618750 358.082625 ju[st]- just just by not knowing you know how to get to that that one bolt or that one screw or whatever to get things apart
sw2692B-ms98-a-0074 358.082625 362.911125 that was that was the biggest thing when i did uh the heater core in my T Bird
sw2692B-ms98-a-0075 362.911125 369.727375 that is got to be the worst location for it and and the only reason i did it i [vocalized-noise]
sw2692B-ms98-a-0076 369.727375 380.890250 yeah yeah the the only ones i've ever heard good good things about are are the old Lincolns and Cadillacs where they had the little door underneath the hood You just open the door and pop it out yeah but but uh
sw2692B-ms98-a-0077 380.890250 386.661000 i- i had i had taken this in to have it done originally and uh
sw2692B-ms98-a-0078 386.661000 393.509750 oh it it was it was tremend[ous]- well it was about seven hours labor so it it was going to run about four hundred dollars or so
sw2692B-ms98-a-0079 393.509750 397.526750 and they looked it over and they they
sw2692B-ms98-a-0080 397.526750 401.210000 they thought they could patch it up a little bit you know and what not so they
sw2692B-ms98-a-0081 401.210000 403.356750 [silence]
sw2692B-ms98-a-0082 403.356750 410.891250 yeah ye[ah]- yeah and it was it was leaking inside the car in the condenser unit so uh they they did a little patch on it
sw2692B-ms98-a-0083 410.891250 422.389750 and it l[ast]- it held for about four to six months and i finally went back in and started looking at it myself and i[t]- it's a matter tearing all the dash out and all that kind of stuff but hey it was not
sw2692B-ms98-a-0084 422.389750 428.674750 uh it was not a seven hour labor job for me it was about a week before i finally got through 
sw2692B-ms98-a-0085 428.674750 434.994625 [silence]
sw2692B-ms98-a-0086 434.994625 443.174250 yeah oh really no this this was the only thing that sticks in inside the engine compartment on this are the two uh hose fittings
sw2692B-ms98-a-0087 443.174250 444.961250 [silence]
sw2692B-ms98-a-0088 444.961250 448.535875 yeah it it's i i've never heard a [laughter-good] story about uh

sw2692B-ms98-a-0101 474.477500 480.833875 you bet well that that's what ended up being the real problem on this was the uh it the the pipe wasn't busted
sw2692B-ms98-a-0102 480.833875 486.063000 but the it wasn't soldered in good enough and it had it had broken loose enough to where
sw2692B-ms98-a-0103 486.063000 487.639000 if it got hot
sw2692B-ms98-a-0104 487.639000 495.675875 and and n[ot]- just normal driving didn't do it but if if if it was an especially hot day the pressure would get high enough and it would start blowing the water out inside
sw2692B-ms98-a-0105 495.675875 498.742875 it was real aggravating but uh i i couldn't
sw2692B-ms98-a-0106 498.742875 507.330250 eve[n]- even a week's a week's time is i[s]- is worth [laughter-a] whole lot less than four than four hundred dollars to me you know than to have somebody else do it
