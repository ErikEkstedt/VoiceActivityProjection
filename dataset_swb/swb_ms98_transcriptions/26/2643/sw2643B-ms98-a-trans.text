sw2643B-ms98-a-0007 15.262000 21.719125 [silence]
sw2643B-ms98-a-0008 21.719125 28.540875 uh i guess a typical home here is without a uh uh basement i guess that's the classical uh
sw2643B-ms98-a-0009 28.540875 42.146375 yeah uh we have something here we have something here you may not have up there which is a well we we were phasing them out is the wood shingle roof i don't know if you had it when i first got here
sw2643B-ms98-a-0010 42.146375 43.626000 [silence]
sw2643B-ms98-a-0011 43.626000 45.468625 from New Jersey

sw2643B-ms98-a-0013 47.359000 52.290375 right no i i'm my accent's gone i've practiced a long time to get rid of it uh
sw2643B-ms98-a-0014 52.290375 59.336625 the the wood shingle roofs are phasing out here they're very they're good for air-conditioning you know they they
sw2643B-ms98-a-0015 59.336625 64.115125 it's you it's very shocking when you look inside the attic and on a dry day
sw2643B-ms98-a-0016 64.115125 69.630875 and see a hundred little or thousands of little light wholes you know
sw2643B-ms98-a-0017 69.630875 73.833125 it it's very strange and then when of course when it rains then it then it then it stretches
sw2643B-ms98-a-0018 73.833125 78.558125 and does a pretty good job but uh the the fire hazard has is
sw2643B-ms98-a-0019 78.558125 81.422250 phasing that kind of construction out it it's so
sw2643B-ms98-a-0020 81.422250 82.423875 [silence]
sw2643B-ms98-a-0021 82.423875 84.996375 oh it's a rent it's a multistorey

sw2643B-ms98-a-0040 130.050500 135.006250 yeah that that i heard i know those words from the east when i was there but that they don't use that word here
sw2643B-ms98-a-0041 135.006250 140.252250 [silence]
sw2643B-ms98-a-0042 140.252250 142.050000 do you have a basement
sw2643B-ms98-a-0043 142.050000 144.402875 oh yeah that's typical up there to you know
sw2643B-ms98-a-0044 144.402875 156.085500 [silence]
sw2643B-ms98-a-0045 156.085500 158.599625 oh yeah no the land is much cheaper here
sw2643B-ms98-a-0046 158.599625 173.183750 [silence]
sw2643B-ms98-a-0047 173.183750 174.454125 yeah

sw2643B-ms98-a-0051 188.891125 193.771250 yeah the lots aren't very big here either in the Dallas uh Fort Worth area
sw2643B-ms98-a-0052 193.771250 200.434250 uh but the basement there just aren't any basements i don't know of anyone ever even thought of putting a basement in here
sw2643B-ms98-a-0053 200.434250 202.139625 [silence]
sw2643B-ms98-a-0054 202.139625 213.431750 uh it used to be a pier and beam where they would drill piers and and the first you would have a crawl space underneath your house but that's phased out in the last twenty five years where it's all slab
sw2643B-ms98-a-0055 213.431750 215.611750 [silence]
sw2643B-ms98-a-0056 215.611750 216.694500 yeah
sw2643B-ms98-a-0057 216.694500 226.348500 and uh th[ey]- they say that the the reason they don't put pier i think it's cheaper like you say but uh the soil does move a lot here and they say that you just couldn't uh
sw2643B-ms98-a-0058 226.348500 233.639000 put a basement in the soil but i'd think they just to me i don't know really know why it wouldn't work i think you can put a basement in anywhere it's just not not popular
sw2643B-ms98-a-0059 233.639000 235.176375 [silence]
sw2643B-ms98-a-0060 235.176375 236.532625 yeah really

sw2643B-ms98-a-0062 237.547625 240.699250 no no it's not very high some of the water here
sw2643B-ms98-a-0063 240.699250 243.916500 yeah this is Dallas there the water's down two thousand feet
sw2643B-ms98-a-0064 243.916500 247.545125 [silence]
sw2643B-ms98-a-0065 247.545125 262.467125 yeah i guess it's the style i really don't have an answer here because of the tornado i always thought tornados uh i thought people would build a lot of storm cellars you know or shelters you know but even that is not uh popular at all i don't know i don't know of anyone doing that uh
sw2643B-ms98-a-0066 262.467125 269.390750 uh i don't even see it in the newspaper where people advertise that they have uh storm cellars or anything they just don't have them period 
sw2643B-ms98-a-0067 269.390750 273.184125 [silence]
sw2643B-ms98-a-0068 273.184125 278.132000 yeah it's it's multilevel yeah like my garage i have uh uh a bedroom over
sw2643B-ms98-a-0069 278.132000 279.510875 split level yeah

sw2643B-ms98-a-0080 318.481125 321.795000 what's your typical heating up there in Maryland gas or
sw2643B-ms98-a-0081 321.795000 328.339750 [silence]
sw2643B-ms98-a-0082 328.339750 329.403500 uh-huh

sw2643B-ms98-a-0086 345.807250 347.210375 oh really
sw2643B-ms98-a-0087 347.210375 349.424000 well heat pumps nice up there it would probably work pretty well
sw2643B-ms98-a-0088 349.424000 353.125750 [silence]
sw2643B-ms98-a-0089 353.125750 354.441750 yeah that's true
sw2643B-ms98-a-0090 354.441750 359.027875 [silence]
sw2643B-ms98-a-0091 359.027875 370.066750 well they should yeah because it's warmer in the winter or you have less of a winter down here of course it's a short winter but it does get down to five degrees uh occasionally
sw2643B-ms98-a-0092 370.066750 377.609875 but uh i don't really know if heat pumps are that popular yet i guess uh i don't i haven't been that close to it in the newer homes
sw2643B-ms98-a-0093 377.609875 378.911875 [silence]
sw2643B-ms98-a-0094 378.911875 388.622375 yeah we we have heat uh some have air-conditioning units i i i have an all electric house but uh it's fifty fifty there's a lot of gas houses here uh because it's so popular
sw2643B-ms98-a-0095 388.622375 390.049000 [silence]
sw2643B-ms98-a-0096 390.049000 391.501875 oh yeah
sw2643B-ms98-a-0097 391.501875 396.037000 people i think probably prefer natural gas for for heating
sw2643B-ms98-a-0098 396.037000 398.002875 [silence]
sw2643B-ms98-a-0099 398.002875 405.958875 i don't i'm an engineer and i don't like the danger of it i've seen too many houses here blowup and i think yeah and i just think
sw2643B-ms98-a-0100 405.958875 409.606000 when i ha[d]- i had uh a gas uh
sw2643B-ms98-a-0101 409.606000 424.594500 uh fireplace you know i had and i saw the way it was construct[ed]- yeah it went over my daughter's bedrooms you know over the garage i thought and there's there's just too many fittings in this thing to leak and so i just disconnect[ed]- i never did hook that sucker up so i just took it out completely
sw2643B-ms98-a-0102 424.594500 430.747250 although people love gas here but i i'm ultraconservative on safety and i just don't don't want it
sw2643B-ms98-a-0103 430.747250 438.935125 [silence]
sw2643B-ms98-a-0104 438.935125 441.042250 yeah well i've heard peop[le]-
