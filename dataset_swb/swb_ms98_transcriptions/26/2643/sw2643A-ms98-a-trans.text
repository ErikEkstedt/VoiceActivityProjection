sw2643A-ms98-a-0036 106.051250 107.892625 oh you work at TI
sw2643A-ms98-a-0037 107.892625 110.188375 so that's how you got hooked up to this
sw2643A-ms98-a-0038 110.188375 116.655750 you know you know you can converse with the person for a while and get to know them before you punch the one you don't have to get started on the conversation right away
sw2643A-ms98-a-0039 116.655750 119.962500 well anyway um well uh
sw2643A-ms98-a-0040 119.962500 120.956375 [silence]
sw2643A-ms98-a-0041 120.956375 124.069250 oh i don't know several eleven twelve thirteen i guess
sw2643A-ms98-a-0042 124.069250 130.300875 well i haven't made the calls mostly i've just uh i answered them i live in a two story type colonial here in Maryland
sw2643A-ms98-a-0043 130.300875 132.639500 [silence]
sw2643A-ms98-a-0044 132.639500 141.303750 yeah well most the homes here are two story because uh they stack them up since the property is so expensive at least in the Maryland area where i am
sw2643A-ms98-a-0045 141.303750 142.414375 yeah
sw2643A-ms98-a-0046 142.414375 143.551625 [silence]
sw2643A-ms98-a-0047 143.551625 156.428750 yeah well like i say the land here and depending on where you are and how crowded it is the land bays go up and here a little old measly quarter of an acre goes from anywhere from four to five thousand to a hundred and some odd thousand depending on where it is
sw2643A-ms98-a-0048 156.428750 157.766250 [silence]
sw2643A-ms98-a-0049 157.766250 163.050000 and if you're in a fairly decent subdivision which i guess maybe i'm in a fairly middle-class subdivision then
sw2643A-ms98-a-0050 163.050000 170.501750 the general trend is to put as much house as you can on a quarter acre it took me a long time to get used to it coming from down south up here
sw2643A-ms98-a-0051 170.501750 173.813625 big big houses on little bitty postage stamp lots
sw2643A-ms98-a-0052 173.813625 176.400375 but uh that's the general way they uh
sw2643A-ms98-a-0053 176.400375 183.386875 they build them here so you get about a twenty two hundred to three thousand square foot home depending on whether you include the basement or not
sw2643A-ms98-a-0054 183.386875 189.260500 uh on about a quarter of an acre or less about ten thousand square feet
sw2643A-ms98-a-0055 189.260500 192.943750 [silence]
sw2643A-ms98-a-0056 192.943750 194.582000 uh-huh uh-huh
sw2643A-ms98-a-0057 194.582000 198.259500 [silence]
sw2643A-ms98-a-0058 198.259500 199.283125 huh
sw2643A-ms98-a-0059 199.283125 203.452375 well they use slab foundations or do they use block foundations or the little
sw2643A-ms98-a-0060 203.452375 204.810750 crawl space
sw2643A-ms98-a-0061 204.810750 213.134875 [silence]
sw2643A-ms98-a-0062 213.134875 216.787625 okay slabs are easier and quicker to pour and lay i guess
sw2643A-ms98-a-0063 216.787625 225.333250 [silence]
sw2643A-ms98-a-0064 225.333250 226.737125 uh uh-huh
sw2643A-ms98-a-0065 226.737125 233.516500 [silence]
sw2643A-ms98-a-0066 233.516500 235.496000 i see what to dig out for it
sw2643A-ms98-a-0067 235.496000 237.495125 do you have high water tables
sw2643A-ms98-a-0068 237.495125 239.292500 [silence]
sw2643A-ms98-a-0069 239.292500 241.347625 so it's just a matter they just don't do it
sw2643A-ms98-a-0070 241.347625 242.458875 uh-huh
sw2643A-ms98-a-0071 242.458875 248.150250 well of course down there you probably don't have land as quite as much a premium so you can sprawl a big rancher out
sw2643A-ms98-a-0072 248.150250 257.071250 [silence]
sw2643A-ms98-a-0073 257.071250 258.758250 yeah yeah
sw2643A-ms98-a-0074 258.758250 262.145125 [silence]
sw2643A-ms98-a-0075 262.145125 263.228875 uh-huh

sw2643A-ms98-a-0077 267.784125 269.180875 uh-huh
sw2643A-ms98-a-0078 269.180875 273.656375 i understand well uh you say you live in a ranch style house yourself
sw2643A-ms98-a-0079 273.656375 275.058875 [silence]
sw2643A-ms98-a-0080 275.058875 276.461250 well now
sw2643A-ms98-a-0081 276.461250 278.806500 is it like a split level
sw2643A-ms98-a-0082 278.806500 291.613500 in other words you've got some bedrooms above say a garage area and then the living room dining room area is halfway between both you go down steps to your garage and maybe a family room down there and you go up the steps to your bedroom
sw2643A-ms98-a-0083 291.613500 297.524500 okay that's what they call a split level up here and a split foyer is where all the steps are at the entrance way
sw2643A-ms98-a-0084 297.524500 299.242375 if you know what i mean
sw2643A-ms98-a-0085 299.242375 308.715250 that's a split foyer type and then uh a colonial is where they stack it on top of each other and you pretty well have most of your living space on the first floor like uh
sw2643A-ms98-a-0086 308.715250 319.534250 a family room or uh you know something like that and the dining room area and a living room and maybe a a kitchen with a possible little eat in area or something like that
sw2643A-ms98-a-0087 319.534250 320.693750 [silence]
sw2643A-ms98-a-0088 320.693750 333.023500 well uh y[ou]- [laughter] i've been through two or three different things of them first house i came up here had gas heat with electric stove then the second house i owned had gas heat and gas stove and uh
sw2643A-ms98-a-0089 333.023500 341.889500 um even gas water heater whereas my previous home it had electric water heater anyway and then the house i'm in now is all
sw2643A-ms98-a-0090 341.889500 346.311250 uh electric it even has a heat pump
sw2643A-ms98-a-0091 346.311250 348.761000 yeah and uh
sw2643A-ms98-a-0092 348.761000 353.721250 well heat pumps do work pretty well up here it's taking them a few years to get the bugs out of them but uh
sw2643A-ms98-a-0093 353.721250 361.483375 they they finally seem to work quite well and i would imagine down where you all live heat pumps will work quite well or maybe down there all you need is just air-conditioning that's all
sw2643A-ms98-a-0094 361.483375 364.199375 [silence]
sw2643A-ms98-a-0095 364.199375 365.820500 uh-huh uh-huh

sw2643A-ms98-a-0099 375.972125 379.268875 well i would imagine all you need is just air-conditioning
sw2643A-ms98-a-0100 379.268875 383.277625 [silence]
sw2643A-ms98-a-0101 383.277625 384.482500 uh-huh

sw2643A-ms98-a-0103 386.699000 391.956500 oh that's right you're you're in the oil state so i would imagine there's plenty of gas around so that's the way to go for heat
sw2643A-ms98-a-0104 391.956500 393.202500 yeah
sw2643A-ms98-a-0105 393.202500 395.224750 [silence]
sw2643A-ms98-a-0106 395.224750 399.226875 uh-huh i would too because me i like gas heat i love it
sw2643A-ms98-a-0107 399.226875 403.156750 [silence]
sw2643A-ms98-a-0108 403.156750 404.425250 oh really

sw2643A-ms98-a-0110 411.118500 413.244375 uh-huh gas logs

sw2643A-ms98-a-0118 430.487375 439.627625 well i don't mind electric heating and and the like it's okay i mean i i like gas heat because it's so nice and warm but when it comes to cooking i c[ook]- i just absolute think a gas stove's the best that money can buy
sw2643A-ms98-a-0119 439.627625 442.446500 you just can't beat cooking on gas
sw2643A-ms98-a-0120 442.446500 457.445375 that flame man is hard to beat because you can regulate it and i mean you you want to turn the flame down on the stove you turn it down right now you don't have to wait for a cool down time which you have to rely on with uh conventional stove or or a warm-up time i mean it's instantly there
sw2643A-ms98-a-0121 457.445375 461.666750 and that kind of response is quite uh quite effective i think for cooking
sw2643A-ms98-a-0122 461.666750 466.150750 [silence]
sw2643A-ms98-a-0123 466.150750 467.234375 uh-huh
