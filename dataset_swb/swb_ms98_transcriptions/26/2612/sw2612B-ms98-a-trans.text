sw2612B-ms98-a-0002 4.519750 11.330250 well there there's been some interesting stuff going on locally but i suppose nationally the big thing is probably uh the
sw2612B-ms98-a-0003 11.330250 13.853000 reaction to the war in the Gulf
sw2612B-ms98-a-0004 13.853000 15.268750 [silence]

sw2612B-ms98-a-0011 37.776500 48.523500 yeah that's true there there's a lot of talk over there tha[t]- i don't think anyone imagined that it could possibly be as as successful and and painless as it had been
sw2612B-ms98-a-0012 48.523500 53.214625 so they figured a little bit of opposition was safe but it didn't turn out that way

sw2612B-ms98-a-0014 60.313500 63.622500 well that's why that's why being strangers is safe we can

sw2612B-ms98-a-0022 101.752125 112.575250 well that's true but i suppose it's hard to judge from the eighties because um Reagan was just so overwhelming to them i think they're seeing some of that unraveling these days but
sw2612B-ms98-a-0023 112.575250 119.893875 [silence]
sw2612B-ms98-a-0024 119.893875 123.322750 well they've already got uh oh jeez
sw2612B-ms98-a-0025 123.322750 132.906375 there['s]- there['s]- there's already one candidate that i know of on the Democratic end and i keep thinking there's a second one uh Paul Tsongas
sw2612B-ms98-a-0026 132.906375 136.398750 yeah uh out of Massachusetts i think

sw2612B-ms98-a-0034 163.997375 170.224250 that that would be interesting i i must admit i haven't been really enthusiastic about the Democratic entrants
sw2612B-ms98-a-0035 170.224250 173.303250 in the last couple of run throughs

sw2612B-ms98-a-0041 199.815000 208.348125 true it's it's probably th[eir]- their their troubles probably stem from the fact that they're such a diverse party
sw2612B-ms98-a-0042 208.348125 213.666750 and the nominating rules these days are so um pseudo democratic i guess
sw2612B-ms98-a-0043 213.666750 218.697875 you can't have the people in the back rooms deciding well who could we really get elected instead there's so much

sw2612B-ms98-a-0052 262.767250 270.285875 i i must admit i'm i'm s[till]- i i still find him a little uninspiring he he seems like a reasonably competent
sw2612B-ms98-a-0053 270.285875 271.939375 person to sort of
sw2612B-ms98-a-0054 271.939375 274.424750 do do some caretaking to um

sw2612B-ms98-a-0058 286.307750 294.365875 sort of set the agenda and and let let people do the work it's it's unfortunate how how little domestic agenda he
sw2612B-ms98-a-0059 294.365875 295.884125 h[e]- he worries about

sw2612B-ms98-a-0061 305.021000 310.906000 true but uh so many of his [compi/campaign] campaign promises were on the the domestic promises

sw2612B-ms98-a-0063 312.862500 313.660000 true
sw2612B-ms98-a-0064 313.660000 320.625250 that that's that's what just amazes me though is that that so many people do uh take the campaign promises seriously

sw2612B-ms98-a-0066 322.178125 328.097875 well the the one thing that just amazed me in in Texas here there were a series of um ads
sw2612B-ms98-a-0067 328.097875 335.457625 saying don't vote for Dukakis he's going to take away your right to own a gun he's going to close down defense plants he's going to do this he's going to do that
sw2612B-ms98-a-0068 335.457625 338.384250 half of which is coming true
sw2612B-ms98-a-0069 338.384250 344.938250 and i ju[st]- here's my chance to giggle boy it's a good thing we didn't elect that Dukakis [laughter-guy] because i mea[n]-

sw2612B-ms98-a-0089 451.335000 459.917375 i i find him such an [laughter-embarrassment] and uh i mean the th[e]- the idea of Collin Powell well he's so powerfu[l]- or he's so popular now
sw2612B-ms98-a-0090 459.917375 466.292125 i i i don't know if he's the the right one to replace him he'd probably be a perfectly [laughter-competent] replacement but

sw2612B-ms98-a-0094 479.518250 485.725875 i ge[t]- i i i would probably find him an order of magnitude more capable than Quayle

sw2612B-ms98-a-0096 487.124250 490.453625 it's it's interesting to hear that Bush has
