sw2612A-ms98-a-0039 163.796250 170.905000 [silence]
sw2612A-ms98-a-0040 170.905000 175.010500 well i'll tell you if they if they do it like they did uh
sw2612A-ms98-a-0041 175.010500 178.575000 the last time around [laughter-it's] [laughter-not] going to be very exciting
sw2612A-ms98-a-0042 178.575000 183.249875 you know um i mean let's face Dukakis and B[entsen]- and Bentsen
sw2612A-ms98-a-0043 183.249875 193.782250 good grief surely they could have done better than that course they they had a they had themselves between a rock and a hard place they had on the one hand they had Jesse Jackson with all that support
sw2612A-ms98-a-0044 193.782250 196.500000 and on the other they knew ver[y]-
sw2612A-ms98-a-0045 196.500000 200.613500 oh sure and and they could not give him the nomination
sw2612A-ms98-a-0046 200.613500 201.652250 uh i
sw2612A-ms98-a-0047 201.652250 207.521750 [silence]
sw2612A-ms98-a-0048 207.521750 208.833750 yeah

sw2612A-ms98-a-0053 217.816125 224.768375 i mean i mean they were really stuck because_1 here they were everybody was expecting Je[sse]- Jesse to get at least the VP nomination
sw2612A-ms98-a-0054 224.768375 229.859500 uh certainly not presidential but but quite possibly VP
sw2612A-ms98-a-0055 229.859500 235.354625 and here they are they they know very well they can't do it because if they do it's going to split the party
sw2612A-ms98-a-0056 235.354625 239.119625 and if they do it they're going to alienate a whole bunch of others
sw2612A-ms98-a-0057 239.119625 244.953250 so i mean they were stuck one way or the other yeah it was an interesting thing i was laughing through the whole thing uh
sw2612A-ms98-a-0058 244.953250 246.464500 [silence]
sw2612A-ms98-a-0059 246.464500 257.123500 yeah i it it it wa[s]- it was it was comical i i sat there and watched the just watched CNN and just giggle all night you know uh oh this is great George Bush is [laughter-in]
sw2612A-ms98-a-0060 257.123500 258.746875 [silence]
sw2612A-ms98-a-0061 258.746875 263.331500 and i think Bush has turned out to be a lot better President than people gave him credit for
sw2612A-ms98-a-0062 263.331500 267.396125 [silence]
sw2612A-ms98-a-0063 267.396125 269.337000 yeah he is he
sw2612A-ms98-a-0064 269.337000 271.330000 yeah he he is
sw2612A-ms98-a-0065 271.330000 273.520625 [silence]
sw2612A-ms98-a-0066 273.520625 282.891875 yeah a[nd]- and i i wonder th[e]- you know if if that's i mean tha[t]- that real[ly]- that really should be all we need in a president someone who is capable of managing
sw2612A-ms98-a-0067 282.891875 286.318500 and that's all a president is anyway just a manager
sw2612A-ms98-a-0068 286.318500 287.689375 uh
sw2612A-ms98-a-0069 287.689375 289.932500 and set the agenda and
sw2612A-ms98-a-0070 289.932500 293.493875 [silence]
sw2612A-ms98-a-0071 293.493875 305.200750 yeah well you know the Re[publicans]- Republicans have always been weak on on the domestic side they're they're very big on international stuff but domestically they they just say well it'll take care of itself
sw2612A-ms98-a-0072 305.200750 306.713125 but it's
sw2612A-ms98-a-0073 306.713125 308.120000 [silence]
sw2612A-ms98-a-0074 308.120000 309.717125 yeah
sw2612A-ms98-a-0075 309.717125 314.753750 well you know same old you know take it with a grain of salt stuff you know he he
sw2612A-ms98-a-0076 314.753750 319.984000 [silence]
sw2612A-ms98-a-0077 319.984000 323.266375 yeah yeah and they still do [laughter] he
sw2612A-ms98-a-0078 323.266375 333.556000 [silence]
sw2612A-ms98-a-0079 333.556000 334.713750 um-hum
sw2612A-ms98-a-0080 334.713750 335.946375 um-hum
sw2612A-ms98-a-0081 335.946375 337.760875 [silence]
sw2612A-ms98-a-0082 337.760875 339.147750 yeah
sw2612A-ms98-a-0083 339.147750 343.459625 [silence]
sw2612A-ms98-a-0084 343.459625 350.023125 yeah well you know the interesting thing about i don't know if you've been watching Massachusetts lately um
sw2612A-ms98-a-0085 350.023125 352.556500 [silence]
sw2612A-ms98-a-0086 352.556500 362.462750 oh it's a disaster it's a disaster and the thing was it was all quick fixes finger in the dike sort of thing to make him look good for the upcoming race
sw2612A-ms98-a-0087 362.462750 363.562875 [silence]
sw2612A-ms98-a-0088 363.562875 371.779500 well i mean that that's what you can infer from it because it it's amazing that it started about two years before the the the run
sw2612A-ms98-a-0089 371.779500 378.746250 and then you know it took a few years to crap out but i mean it was dying last year i lived up in Boston
sw2612A-ms98-a-0090 378.746250 383.063875 and i mean it was terrible it was absolutely terrible
sw2612A-ms98-a-0091 383.063875 386.063875 u[p]- prices are just unbelievable up there
sw2612A-ms98-a-0092 386.063875 390.833625 and the services are getting terrible everything's going down the tubes
sw2612A-ms98-a-0093 390.833625 395.391625 said he was going to clean up Boston Harbor and it's dirtier than it ever was
sw2612A-ms98-a-0094 395.391625 396.764625 nev[er]-
sw2612A-ms98-a-0095 396.764625 404.242875 yeah and then on the other hand too while he was out busy running for the presidential thing the legislature was having their own way
sw2612A-ms98-a-0096 404.242875 409.238250 and uh you know it was ju[st]- it was a pure disaster because_1 the way it was set up
sw2612A-ms98-a-0097 409.238250 415.229000 he's the one that that put it together and he's the only one who knew how it worked or supposedly worked
sw2612A-ms98-a-0098 415.229000 417.169125 and he wasn't there to run it
sw2612A-ms98-a-0099 417.169125 422.472250 and so here's a bunch of legislatures with their own agenda uh legislators with their own agenda
sw2612A-ms98-a-0100 422.472250 427.697250 and of course the thing just fell a[part]- fell to pieces and he couldn't do anything with it
sw2612A-ms98-a-0101 427.697250 433.107125 it was amazing they had a poll last year about i guess it was around July
sw2612A-ms98-a-0102 433.107125 434.568125 uh
sw2612A-ms98-a-0103 434.568125 436.980625 they showed the picture of Dukakis
sw2612A-ms98-a-0104 436.980625 441.642875 to people in Massachusetts only twenty three percent could recognize him as governor
sw2612A-ms98-a-0105 441.642875 444.787250 [laughter] it it wa[s]-
sw2612A-ms98-a-0106 444.787250 448.025125 [silence]
sw2612A-ms98-a-0107 448.025125 449.503125 [laughter]
sw2612A-ms98-a-0108 449.503125 451.854125 i wish they would

sw2612A-ms98-a-0114 462.466500 463.800125 boy i tell you
sw2612A-ms98-a-0115 463.800125 464.803250 [silence]
sw2612A-ms98-a-0116 464.803250 469.569125 he i'll tell you what you know when i was in the Air Force i met i met Collin Powell
sw2612A-ms98-a-0117 469.569125 475.738875 yeah i was i had a pretty neat job i got to meet all the big wigs used to fly with the president and all that stuff
sw2612A-ms98-a-0118 475.738875 480.300500 um Collin Powell is one capable guy
sw2612A-ms98-a-0119 480.300500 481.796250 he
sw2612A-ms98-a-0120 481.796250 484.503375 [silence]
sw2612A-ms98-a-0121 484.503375 488.159625 oh yes absolutely i i mean the

sw2612A-ms98-a-0123 489.955375 500.211000 [silence]
sw2612A-ms98-a-0124 500.211000 502.860500 i know i and i i'll tell you you know it
sw2612A-ms98-a-0125 502.860500 506.910625 i i m[y]- my degree was in political science because i enjoyed it
sw2612A-ms98-a-0126 506.910625 514.632500 and i had a good time during that during that election but it floored me when he came up with Quayle
sw2612A-ms98-a-0127 514.632500 518.950625 because there are so many other capable Republicans
sw2612A-ms98-a-0128 518.950625 520.174000 i mean
sw2612A-ms98-a-0129 520.174000 524.165875 [silence]
sw2612A-ms98-a-0130 524.165875 532.574875 yeah a[nd]- i mean certainly he wasn't going to take Bob Dole on and not that Bob Dole would even take the position i mean he'd be giving up more than he'd gain
sw2612A-ms98-a-0131 532.574875 537.087500 but there are several people who are who are just super capable
sw2612A-ms98-a-0132 537.087500 541.600000 but to get this nobody with the kind of baggage that he's carrying
sw2612A-ms98-a-0133 541.600000 548.708500 i uh it just astounded me i mean he must have been so sure of winning that it didn't make any difference
sw2612A-ms98-a-0134 548.708500 557.247250 [silence]
sw2612A-ms98-a-0135 557.247250 559.347500 yeah i well
sw2612A-ms98-a-0136 559.347500 566.409500 [silence]
sw2612A-ms98-a-0137 566.409500 578.338625 yeah i yeah about that time i think it was neck and neck and i the only the only reason at the time that i could think of was that he was young and and sort of charismatic in uh in uh handsome sort of way
sw2612A-ms98-a-0138 578.338625 582.904000 and hoping to bring in maybe a little bit of like Kennedy charisma or something
sw2612A-ms98-a-0139 582.904000 585.480125 but the guy is so uncharismatic
sw2612A-ms98-a-0140 585.480125 586.656500 i mean [laughter]
sw2612A-ms98-a-0141 586.656500 593.502375 [laughter] i mean Bush talks about he doesn't like broccoli well that's h[ow]- how i think of Dan Quayle as broccoli you know [laughter]
