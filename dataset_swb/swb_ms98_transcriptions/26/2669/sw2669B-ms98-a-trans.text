sw2669B-ms98-a-0003 6.543000 11.287750 how should they do it why didn't it work last time
sw2669B-ms98-a-0004 11.287750 12.612875 well
sw2669B-ms98-a-0005 12.612875 15.228875 i'm all for it

sw2669B-ms98-a-0009 36.174000 37.949125 yeah they tried to

sw2669B-ms98-a-0011 48.006250 51.428250 yeah yeah direct conversion

sw2669B-ms98-a-0013 54.556125 67.100750 i think they just ought to you know start uh just go all all the way you know new products introduced or whatever you know start your packaging go to liters instead of quarts and you know people if they have to are going to learn to think that way
sw2669B-ms98-a-0014 67.100750 68.639125 but if you s[tart]-
sw2669B-ms98-a-0015 68.639125 74.264625 [silence]
sw2669B-ms98-a-0016 74.264625 86.224250 they do but things are generally packaged in the English sized packages you know you buy a quart of milk and sure it has has the metric equivalent written on there but it still a quart so if they started putting it in liters liter of oil and
sw2669B-ms98-a-0017 86.224250 95.114875 you know liters of gasoline people are going to learn to think in metric as long as you can still buy a product in the English units that's how you're going to think of it
sw2669B-ms98-a-0018 95.114875 105.540000 [silence]
sw2669B-ms98-a-0019 105.540000 107.325375 figures

sw2669B-ms98-a-0023 125.755250 128.176625 yeah that's that's the problem
sw2669B-ms98-a-0024 128.176625 134.182000 [silence]
sw2669B-ms98-a-0025 134.182000 146.174875 right it's kind of hard for me to believe that this this day and age i don't know when i was growing up we were taught the metric system in school i mean not not at first but by the time i was in fifth or sixth grade anyway
sw2669B-ms98-a-0026 146.174875 150.333000 it's i would expect people with any kind of
sw2669B-ms98-a-0027 150.333000 157.140125 buying power over the age o[f]- or you know under the age of thirty or so to have some idea what it is anyway a liter's about a quart

sw2669B-ms98-a-0029 170.182000 171.408125 yeah

sw2669B-ms98-a-0033 189.293875 191.483500 well thing is it's a global
sw2669B-ms98-a-0034 191.483500 198.044875 global market place these days and you know we're one of like what two backwards [clo/countries] countries in the world as far as
sw2669B-ms98-a-0035 198.044875 199.462250 uh
sw2669B-ms98-a-0036 199.462250 202.443375 something i don't remember what the other one is but
sw2669B-ms98-a-0037 202.443375 203.522125 [silence]
sw2669B-ms98-a-0038 203.522125 210.427750 it's it's just time i think for for us to go over because_1 all you end up doing is if you're in business or you're in any kind of international
sw2669B-ms98-a-0039 210.427750 211.715750 [silence]
sw2669B-ms98-a-0040 211.715750 217.805625 i don't you know i don't know i uh i work for TI we're all around the world you have to perform this conversion anyway
sw2669B-ms98-a-0041 217.805625 219.801500 and
sw2669B-ms98-a-0042 219.801500 225.108250 [silence]
sw2669B-ms98-a-0043 225.108250 227.204500 right {mils} and microns

sw2669B-ms98-a-0051 242.071000 249.579375 yeah i remember how big stink came around in the design area a few years back when it was all overseas designs were in microns and ours were in {mils}
sw2669B-ms98-a-0052 249.579375 254.041750 and it got to you know somewhere down the line they went standardized they went microns but uh
sw2669B-ms98-a-0053 254.041750 257.478125 you just you know you end up with all kinds of problems with converting your designs
sw2669B-ms98-a-0054 257.478125 258.645500 and
sw2669B-ms98-a-0055 258.645500 259.929750 so
sw2669B-ms98-a-0056 259.929750 265.987375 [silence]
sw2669B-ms98-a-0057 265.987375 267.046875 no

sw2669B-ms98-a-0063 303.556125 304.558250 [silence]
sw2669B-ms98-a-0064 304.558250 306.944375 about a half a liter or something
sw2669B-ms98-a-0065 306.944375 308.182125 yeah
sw2669B-ms98-a-0066 308.182125 323.269000 [silence]
sw2669B-ms98-a-0067 323.269000 324.977250 yeah
sw2669B-ms98-a-0068 324.977250 327.093875 i would have more problem wi[th]-
sw2669B-ms98-a-0069 327.093875 330.957250 more problem with the temperature except that you know working in engineering
sw2669B-ms98-a-0070 330.957250 333.512125 we do everything in Centigrade or Celsius
sw2669B-ms98-a-0071 333.512125 338.646250 [silence]
sw2669B-ms98-a-0072 338.646250 339.976250 yeah
sw2669B-ms98-a-0073 339.976250 341.306250 [silence]
sw2669B-ms98-a-0074 341.306250 344.094375 getting warm right
sw2669B-ms98-a-0075 344.094375 362.973000 [silence]
sw2669B-ms98-a-0076 362.973000 365.519250 yeah well it's about
sw2669B-ms98-a-0077 365.519250 371.572500 [silence]
sw2669B-ms98-a-0078 371.572500 375.060750 yeah it's about twice as much yeah what it works out to
sw2669B-ms98-a-0079 375.060750 378.393375 one point one point eight times as many
sw2669B-ms98-a-0080 378.393375 380.364250 points yeah so
sw2669B-ms98-a-0081 380.364250 385.140000 i don't know i think as long as people have a choice they're going to stick with the American way
sw2669B-ms98-a-0082 385.140000 389.519375 and until we have to have to learn to think that way we we won't
sw2669B-ms98-a-0083 389.519375 394.603375 [silence]
sw2669B-ms98-a-0084 394.603375 396.716750 yeah for the most part i think so
sw2669B-ms98-a-0085 396.716750 409.820875 [silence]
sw2669B-ms98-a-0086 409.820875 411.571375 right

sw2669B-ms98-a-0088 427.469625 428.991625 right
sw2669B-ms98-a-0089 428.991625 445.440625 [silence]
sw2669B-ms98-a-0090 445.440625 448.361000 he just get one more [vocalized-noise]
sw2669B-ms98-a-0091 448.361000 456.362750 [silence]
sw2669B-ms98-a-0092 456.362750 459.260375 oh that would be a mess
sw2669B-ms98-a-0093 459.260375 486.969875 [silence]
sw2669B-ms98-a-0094 486.969875 499.436250 well i guess it just gets bad down to you got to you got to have one and not mix them_1 up because you're never going to get to one one system if you s[till]- still got a got a mix
sw2669B-ms98-a-0095 499.436250 507.682750 and of course here that that would involve changing road signs all across the country you know miles per hour to kilometers per hour and the whole whole nine yards
sw2669B-ms98-a-0096 507.682750 510.381000 it's kind of hard to do gradually
sw2669B-ms98-a-0097 510.381000 515.592750 [silence]
sw2669B-ms98-a-0098 515.592750 516.651250 yeah
sw2669B-ms98-a-0099 516.651250 523.498750 [silence]
sw2669B-ms98-a-0100 523.498750 526.370750 oh hell you'd have people doing a hundred miles an hour
sw2669B-ms98-a-0101 526.370750 531.151625 [silence]
sw2669B-ms98-a-0102 531.151625 532.493500 yeah

sw2669B-ms98-a-0104 545.016250 549.529250 yeah but they'd need they'd seem to be ticking off faster too
sw2669B-ms98-a-0105 549.529250 552.918875 every road sign you come to is like well i didn't know i went that far
sw2669B-ms98-a-0106 552.918875 554.415625 i don't know
sw2669B-ms98-a-0107 554.415625 558.761000 [silence]
sw2669B-ms98-a-0108 558.761000 562.675500 yeah i think they you got the problem with all your cars are still
sw2669B-ms98-a-0109 562.675500 565.583500 yeah you still got cars on the road that don't have both
sw2669B-ms98-a-0110 565.583500 567.689000 at that time anyway the
sw2669B-ms98-a-0111 567.689000 571.894125 that was still when things were the metric system was still not
sw2669B-ms98-a-0112 571.894125 574.457000 yeah you know now cars they have both
sw2669B-ms98-a-0113 574.457000 581.702250 sooner or later they'll start putting the miles on the inside and the kilometers in big numbers so people start thinking that way
sw2669B-ms98-a-0114 581.702250 595.424000 [silence]
sw2669B-ms98-a-0115 595.424000 596.799500 yeah
