sw2669A-ms98-a-0002 0.450375 9.587250 okay the topic was uh should the United States adopt the metric system and if so should uh oh
sw2669A-ms98-a-0003 9.587250 16.864750 and why didn't it work last time [laughter] well yeah well i'm
sw2669A-ms98-a-0004 16.864750 30.363250 i i am too i wish uh it had started a long time ago is the the problem because we're so wound up in the in the system that we've got that you know trying to convert over
sw2669A-ms98-a-0005 30.363250 42.569250 and i guess [noise] what'd they try they tried what'd the call it soft conversion and hard conversion one of them_1 is where you just take whatever's already standard and you give it some sort of a weird
sw2669A-ms98-a-0006 42.569250 49.214125 metric number like uh [laughter] six point two eight seven instead of six millimeter something like that

sw2669A-ms98-a-0008 50.860875 52.814625 yeah and uh

sw2669A-ms98-a-0013 66.611000 71.780000 well don't most of them_1 doesn't just about everything now have uh both
sw2669A-ms98-a-0014 71.780000 74.594000 uh metric and English
sw2669A-ms98-a-0015 74.594000 80.975000 [silence]

sw2669A-ms98-a-0022 94.898500 106.171750 i kind of remember back when gas prices started up uh you know pretty dramatically when they started getting toward a dollar a gallon range somebody had uh i believe it was Exxon
sw2669A-ms98-a-0023 106.171750 108.465750 we we were living in uh
sw2669A-ms98-a-0024 108.465750 120.538875 Lubbock at the time they started marketing it in in liters and it was only like [laughter] [laughter-you] [laughter-know] twenty nine and thirty cents a liter so they could put this sign out front that said you know
sw2669A-ms98-a-0025 120.538875 125.723375 thirty nine cents a liter and nobody had any idea what a liter was so
sw2669A-ms98-a-0026 125.723375 127.357625 uh
sw2669A-ms98-a-0027 127.357625 135.566000 when you finally figured out that liters what [laughter-about] a quart there's about four liters in a gallon you know so you can figure out what you're actually paying for it
sw2669A-ms98-a-0028 135.566000 140.393500 [silence]

sw2669A-ms98-a-0033 154.545375 157.291750 yeah i yeah
sw2669A-ms98-a-0034 157.291750 167.971875 the uh i think maybe there's where the the problem came in you know we uh tried to instead of learning it's kind of like learning a language you know when you learn one from the other
sw2669A-ms98-a-0035 167.971875 180.634500 yeah you always end up in this conversion thing all the time so i[t's]- you it's almost like uh course this country isn't a dictatorship but you know it's like somebody said okay as of such and such a date
sw2669A-ms98-a-0036 180.634500 190.501625 you know anybody caught talking in the English m[etric]- you know in the will be shot or something like that you know but uh [laughter] uh

sw2669A-ms98-a-0038 197.303375 200.310500 yeah i read that what Uganda and uh

sw2669A-ms98-a-0040 201.491875 203.477750 there's one or two others that just

sw2669A-ms98-a-0046 216.887250 229.063250 yeah i i do too and uh one of the things that we've r[un]- run into a a problem of course you're familiar with the TI drawing well with any drawing system you end up with uh you end up with things in inches
sw2669A-ms98-a-0047 229.063250 234.818875 in parts of inches you know f[ourth]- half fourth you know this sort of thing and then you end up with a decimal
sw2669A-ms98-a-0048 234.818875 242.307125 where you start getting into {mils} and that sort of thing and then some of them are are done in uh you know purely metric
sw2669A-ms98-a-0049 242.307125 244.539750 and it
sw2669A-ms98-a-0050 244.539750 248.820000 [silence]
sw2669A-ms98-a-0051 248.820000 250.714500 um-hum um-hum

sw2669A-ms98-a-0053 256.757375 259.587375 yeah oh i can imagine
sw2669A-ms98-a-0054 259.587375 262.803750 the uh the one that uh
sw2669A-ms98-a-0055 262.803750 266.122000 uh have you ever lived in a country where they use metric
sw2669A-ms98-a-0056 266.122000 266.977750 or
sw2669A-ms98-a-0057 266.977750 270.796375 i was with TI in in El Salvador for a while
sw2669A-ms98-a-0058 270.796375 276.070875 and uh i had to get used to you know purely metric system down there
sw2669A-ms98-a-0059 276.070875 282.882625 a[nd]- because_1 they they didn't understand anything else you know if you start talking about miles they'd look at you like what you know
sw2669A-ms98-a-0060 282.882625 284.077500 so
sw2669A-ms98-a-0061 284.077500 295.367875 uh i had a little bit of experience with it and also i noticed in Canada they uh you drop a a quarter fifty cents whatever in a
sw2669A-ms98-a-0062 295.367875 300.055375 Coke machine up there and you get this funny looking Coke you know it's in a can that's uh
sw2669A-ms98-a-0063 300.055375 304.774125 that's taller but not as big around you know i guess that's some
sw2669A-ms98-a-0064 304.774125 309.848750 it's not it's not a liter it's like a half a liter or something like that it's a strange looking can
sw2669A-ms98-a-0065 309.848750 314.989750 but my daughter-in-law's from Panama and she has [vocalized-noise] they have uh
sw2669A-ms98-a-0066 314.989750 327.563875 had Americans down there for so long you know that they're they're kind of into both systems but uh she gets real confused on distances and temperature is the big thing is the the Centigrade for which she says Celsius
sw2669A-ms98-a-0067 327.563875 333.443750 [silence]
sw2669A-ms98-a-0068 333.443750 346.036125 well i had kind of gotten used to uh centigrade temperature you know if it's between zero and ten it's cold and if it's between ten and twenty it's not too bad if it's between twenty and thirty it's pretty warm and if it's more than thirty it's just hotter than all get out so
sw2669A-ms98-a-0069 346.036125 350.600000 but uh the big problem is not having the uh uh
sw2669A-ms98-a-0070 350.600000 363.112000 the resolution between temperature you know between a hundred and if you're talking about a hundred degrees or what thirty zero you know thirty four degrees whatever that is you know y[ou]- you don't get all the little
sw2669A-ms98-a-0071 363.112000 374.365000 the differences you know the differences between seventy and seventy two or seventy five degrees isn't much but the difference between thirty and thirty five degrees is is quite a bit yeah
sw2669A-ms98-a-0072 374.365000 377.175500 yeah five [vocalized-noise] [laughter-well] i
sw2669A-ms98-a-0073 377.175500 379.348625 yeah something like that yeah
sw2669A-ms98-a-0074 379.348625 380.571875 [silence]
sw2669A-ms98-a-0075 380.571875 382.610875 i

sw2669A-ms98-a-0079 389.211375 394.949375 yeah i know we keep calling it the English system but i'm i'm not sure what they do in England now they're they're on metric aren't they
sw2669A-ms98-a-0080 394.949375 396.170000 [silence]
sw2669A-ms98-a-0081 396.170000 404.591625 yeah except they've got a now okay there we ran into some problems once i remember uh they've got a a nut and bolts system called Wentworth
sw2669A-ms98-a-0082 404.591625 411.452625 and uh this thing was was even different than you know SAE standards and stuff so
sw2669A-ms98-a-0083 411.452625 412.804000 uh uh
sw2669A-ms98-a-0084 412.804000 420.326000 this this ca[me]- okay my my dad bought uh one of these little Nash Metropolitans here a few years ba[ck]- you know quite a few years back
sw2669A-ms98-a-0085 420.326000 427.901500 and the thing had uh uh an Austin Heeley type uh engine you know it was Austin motors engine and running gear
sw2669A-ms98-a-0086 427.901500 436.772375 and the body was built by Nash or who you know American it wasn't that was even before American Motors but Nash essentially in the US somewhere
sw2669A-ms98-a-0087 436.772375 449.188875 and that thing had the darndest combination of metric and Wentworth and uh SAE he ended up with about three sets of tools [laughter] in order to work on that fool thing because uh
sw2669A-ms98-a-0088 449.188875 455.502875 i think the Wentworth and the SAE bolt sizes were the same but the threads were different
sw2669A-ms98-a-0089 455.502875 460.526125 and uh [laughter-it] was it wa[s]- it was a it was a total me[ss]-
sw2669A-ms98-a-0090 460.526125 466.347375 and i know on my Chevy van that's a couple of years old uh part of it's built in Canada
sw2669A-ms98-a-0091 466.347375 477.535875 matter of fact the thing is i always say it's built off shore [laughter-you] [laughter-know] [laughter-because_1] it was assembled in Canada the only thing that was in it was built in the US was the uh differential and it was built in Buffalo New York
sw2669A-ms98-a-0092 477.535875 482.086000 but it's got the darndest combination of uh of metric and
sw2669A-ms98-a-0093 482.086000 487.670625 most of the body parts seem to be metric and most of the engine parts seem to be SAE so it's
sw2669A-ms98-a-0094 487.670625 489.399500 it's just crazy
sw2669A-ms98-a-0095 489.399500 492.943000 [silence]
sw2669A-ms98-a-0096 492.943000 494.023625 yeah

sw2669A-ms98-a-0103 508.051625 510.233125 [silence]
sw2669A-ms98-a-0104 510.233125 518.419375 i thought maybe they would convert to uh metric back when they went to the fifty five mile an hour speed limit because_1 what is it fifty six or fifty seven's a hundred
sw2669A-ms98-a-0105 518.419375 532.054750 uh uh [vocalized-noise] or a hundred kilometers and uh you know a hu[ndred]- a hundred yeah you'd have a hundreds on the sign looks lot better than fifty five but you'd have people going you're right a hundred miles an hour yeah
sw2669A-ms98-a-0106 532.054750 538.237250 and so i don't know i'd kind of and the other thing too is you know between here and
sw2669A-ms98-a-0107 538.237250 545.117250 El Paso's what five hundred miles but it's it's almost eight hundred kilometers you know that'd sure seems like a long way
sw2669A-ms98-a-0108 545.117250 546.630500 [laughter]
sw2669A-ms98-a-0109 546.630500 548.143875 [silence]
sw2669A-ms98-a-0110 548.143875 550.016125 yeah i guess that's it
sw2669A-ms98-a-0111 550.016125 552.972750 [silence]
sw2669A-ms98-a-0112 552.972750 559.097250 well they converted all the road signs to fifty five miles an hour you know they could of converted it to metric just about as easy
sw2669A-ms98-a-0113 559.097250 564.818750 [silence]

sw2669A-ms98-a-0125 581.674125 588.969375 i know the only other place that i was ever at where they really had it mixed was was in Panama where's a lot of the road signs and everything are in uh
sw2669A-ms98-a-0126 588.969375 590.890750 in miles per hour
sw2669A-ms98-a-0127 590.890750 593.054375 and some are in uh
sw2669A-ms98-a-0128 593.054375 599.919625 in kilometers and you you got to know where you are because anything that was the old canal zone is going to be miles per hour but any
