sw2678A-ms98-a-0021 66.856625 78.185250 yeah i'm pretty much the same way you know people always say wow th[e]- the meanings of those words and i'm always meaning there's wor[ds]- well you know i just thought they just all sort of rhymed you know [noise]
sw2678A-ms98-a-0022 78.185250 80.317125 [silence]
sw2678A-ms98-a-0023 80.317125 83.060250 right yeah tha[t]- whenever they say it two or three times
sw2678A-ms98-a-0024 83.060250 94.248000 [laughter] i'm the same way [laughter] yeah it's funny um [noise] depending on where you live i i i commute back and forth between Baltimore and a rural town called Salisbury which is
sw2678A-ms98-a-0025 94.248000 107.355125 two and a half hours away and the difference in the radio with popular music is totally different you know when yeah because_1 Baltimore'll play more um what might be considered mo[re]- little bit more progressive
sw2678A-ms98-a-0026 107.355125 121.060000 and as soon as you go down to Salisbury this town that's you know uh two and a half hours away in the suburbs or whatever uh in the real rural Balti[more]- uh Maryland they it turns into [vocalized-noise] basically classic rock
sw2678A-ms98-a-0027 121.060000 132.541125 and they don't you know yeah mostly oldies but classic rock you know wi[th]- if you know like when the Doors movie came out you know Doors was really on the radio there
sw2678A-ms98-a-0028 132.541125 145.578250 you know where you know you'd hear what's one or two of their more famous songs maybe top forty in Baltimore but in Salisbury you wou[ld]- that's all you would hear was this is the Doors you know so was sort of a funny thing
sw2678A-ms98-a-0029 145.578250 147.620500 [silence]
sw2678A-ms98-a-0030 147.620500 148.761500 [noise] you
sw2678A-ms98-a-0031 148.761500 149.634625 [vocalized-noise] you
sw2678A-ms98-a-0032 149.634625 154.227125 yes that's i'm starting to realize that i never really thought about that much but there is
sw2678A-ms98-a-0033 154.227125 155.692000 yeah i never
sw2678A-ms98-a-0034 155.692000 162.171375 i never i didn't i i lived in Pittsburgh before Baltimore and i didn't i never really noticed the difference when i moved to this area
sw2678A-ms98-a-0035 162.171375 170.030625 i really didn't notice at all it just seemed the same but when i went more rural you know that it really changed so
sw2678A-ms98-a-0036 170.030625 171.278500 [silence]
sw2678A-ms98-a-0037 171.278500 173.686250 oh does it yeah
sw2678A-ms98-a-0038 173.686250 177.933750 [silence]
sw2678A-ms98-a-0039 177.933750 179.441750 yeah
sw2678A-ms98-a-0040 179.441750 183.947125 [silence]

sw2678A-ms98-a-0042 185.234000 189.403000 [silence]
sw2678A-ms98-a-0043 189.403000 196.155625 right yeah boy that would really be beneficial because_1 you never hear the you never hear the news basically on the radio i never get it
sw2678A-ms98-a-0044 196.155625 200.808375 you know and if you don't if you don't read the paper you sort of fall behind if you're in the car all the time
sw2678A-ms98-a-0045 200.808375 202.589625 yeah that's pretty good
sw2678A-ms98-a-0046 202.589625 205.888125 [silence]
sw2678A-ms98-a-0047 205.888125 207.160250 um-hum

sw2678A-ms98-a-0051 212.323125 214.477125 yeah yeah in fact
sw2678A-ms98-a-0052 214.477125 224.036250 m[y]- my uh my grandmother does that a lot because_1 she's blind or wha[t]- she's losing her sight or whatever but yeah that of in i can imagine you know if you're driving cross country
sw2678A-ms98-a-0053 224.036250 229.564750 you know uh listening to a story [vocalized-noise] lot of the classics are really on tape yeah
sw2678A-ms98-a-0054 229.564750 231.819000 yeah that that would be good
sw2678A-ms98-a-0055 231.819000 240.431500 well we strayed a lot from music but i but i guess music comes into that whole aspect of listening so as long as you're listening so
sw2678A-ms98-a-0056 240.431500 243.862750 [noise] but if you do if you do have to go something i guess we can just cut off
