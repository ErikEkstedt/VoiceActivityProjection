sw2635A-ms98-a-0004 4.036375 10.197875 well i think the idea of public uh health services is a good one i think that we all
sw2635A-ms98-a-0005 10.197875 21.819750 um perhaps have a civic duty but i don't know as though it should be uh and i don't know if this uh was my interpretation was that perhaps it should be uh like a forced thing
sw2635A-ms98-a-0006 21.819750 35.256500 um i think it should all be voluntary as it is now but um i do agree that i think it is a good thing because i don't know how else a lot of these um things could happen if they didn't have the volunteers to do it

sw2635A-ms98-a-0018 106.951500 115.756375 well that's true and of course there was the need there and they didn't have any other resource and and uh i guess it it served it's purpose
sw2635A-ms98-a-0019 115.756375 125.930000 right is that what it was meant to do but as you say they were paid and i'm not all that familiar with the Peace Corps although i have friends who have family members that are in it and um
sw2635A-ms98-a-0020 125.930000 136.570875 um they generally go abroad and and uh serve but they don't get a salary and they give up uh X number of years of their lives to do this

sw2635A-ms98-a-0023 139.805375 154.408625 i know some people that just came back from South America and uh they they are degreed and once they got their degrees they're a married couple and they went off they got uh s[ome]- they got some compensation but it wasn't a whole lot

sw2635A-ms98-a-0025 155.589875 167.269250 yeah more like a sabbatical i would imagine and uh i guess a lot of it was a learning experience for them i- i imagine it takes just different kinds of people
sw2635A-ms98-a-0026 167.269250 173.407250 and now they're uh back in school so maybe they're people in the beginning that just want to

sw2635A-ms98-a-0028 174.624750 178.265875 be in a constant learning environment i- i don't know

sw2635A-ms98-a-0031 181.110750 190.036625 yes i- i agree i so mu[ch]- so many of our things are going outside the country to benefit other nations and okay that's fine but what about here
sw2635A-ms98-a-0032 190.036625 191.114625 you know

sw2635A-ms98-a-0042 254.962250 265.002875 you know maybe we've um got a turn around here maybe in the beginning we thought it wasn't such a good idea but perhaps if we instrumented it here in the US
sw2635A-ms98-a-0043 265.002875 274.943625 rather than taking all that manpower out of the US and providing a service for people to join here and do some good we could come up with some of those things

sw2635A-ms98-a-0051 307.123250 317.599125 that's uh that's a good thought now see i hadn't thought about it that way my first uh thought was when they mentioned that was to people who go abroad and do service abroad
sw2635A-ms98-a-0052 317.599125 322.634875 and perhaps there might be as you say more of an effort here needed

sw2635A-ms98-a-0054 333.196375 335.034000 yes that's true

sw2635A-ms98-a-0060 372.839375 383.936500 i agree it doesn't always work that way the way it was intended and then the people change in this country too and not and are not able to see it through our administration changes also
sw2635A-ms98-a-0061 383.936500 385.281625 so

sw2635A-ms98-a-0071 436.164125 439.632125 but it's been interesting it's been an interesting soapbox
sw2635A-ms98-a-0072 439.632125 440.850625 so

sw2635A-ms98-a-0076 452.382000 466.755875 now i thought that was just a sign of the times we're all stressed out that's what they're trying to tell us that that we now get upset because we have to wait in line or wait in traffic but in in reality there's so much more traffic and so many more lines and
sw2635A-ms98-a-0077 466.755875 469.765000 really like you say something needs to be done about that too

sw2635A-ms98-a-0083 485.605000 497.377000 apparently uh if we could get like we were discussing some people involved in this country like they want to be involved in other countries maybe we could do some some real good here
sw2635A-ms98-a-0084 497.377000 500.267000 you know and not take so long to do it
sw2635A-ms98-a-0085 500.267000 502.196625 i think it could happen
