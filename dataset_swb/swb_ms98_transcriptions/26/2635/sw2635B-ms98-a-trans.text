sw2635B-ms98-a-0002 1.593500 5.021875 okay Janet could you tell me what your thoughts are
sw2635B-ms98-a-0003 5.021875 35.171625 [silence]
sw2635B-ms98-a-0004 35.171625 37.367125 yeah they uh
sw2635B-ms98-a-0005 37.367125 41.192125 um the example they gave was like the Peace Corps
sw2635B-ms98-a-0006 41.192125 42.754500 uh
sw2635B-ms98-a-0007 42.754500 45.756625 i'm not so sure if i- i agree with that
sw2635B-ms98-a-0008 45.756625 47.637000 see uh
sw2635B-ms98-a-0009 47.637000 50.209375 [silence]
sw2635B-ms98-a-0010 50.209375 54.089250 back in Roosevelt's administration they had the CCC camps
sw2635B-ms98-a-0011 54.089250 55.059375 [silence]
sw2635B-ms98-a-0012 55.059375 57.807625 and i don't know about down in your area but
sw2635B-ms98-a-0013 57.807625 67.680000 like up here they built bridges and they built uh uh waterways leading from reservoirs to reservoirs to get to the city
sw2635B-ms98-a-0014 67.680000 77.487500 in fact in my area it's it's kind of a rural area and it's and the waterways are still in place you know they're uh they're beautiful they're all stone walled
sw2635B-ms98-a-0015 77.487500 79.288875 and
sw2635B-ms98-a-0016 79.288875 88.569875 it it just leads from the reservoirs way up in the hills and it just leads down into other reservoirs some of the bridges are still standing too i mean some of them need repair now
sw2635B-ms98-a-0017 88.569875 91.265750 but because of
sw2635B-ms98-a-0018 91.265750 92.830500 [silence]
sw2635B-ms98-a-0019 92.830500 96.759875 the recession back then or the depression whatever you want to call it
sw2635B-ms98-a-0020 96.759875 104.216875 uh there was a lot of people out of work so the government brought them in i mean they they performed a a public service
sw2635B-ms98-a-0021 104.216875 105.237875 [silence]
sw2635B-ms98-a-0022 105.237875 107.084000 but yet they were paid for it too
sw2635B-ms98-a-0023 107.084000 111.652875 [silence]
sw2635B-ms98-a-0024 111.652875 113.000875 right
sw2635B-ms98-a-0025 113.000875 128.493125 [silence]
sw2635B-ms98-a-0026 128.493125 129.662375 right
sw2635B-ms98-a-0027 129.662375 136.196375 [silence]
sw2635B-ms98-a-0028 136.196375 138.903500 yeah but they must get some compensation somewhere
sw2635B-ms98-a-0029 138.903500 153.741375 [silence]
sw2635B-ms98-a-0030 153.741375 156.151625 uh wa[s]- was it like a sabbatical
sw2635B-ms98-a-0031 156.151625 162.751625 [silence]
sw2635B-ms98-a-0032 162.751625 163.853250 yeah
sw2635B-ms98-a-0033 163.853250 174.809375 [silence]
sw2635B-ms98-a-0034 174.809375 177.033250 uh yeah like yeah
sw2635B-ms98-a-0035 177.033250 178.765500 [silence]
sw2635B-ms98-a-0036 178.765500 181.253500 yeah i think i think we need it in this country 
sw2635B-ms98-a-0037 181.253500 189.534500 [silence]
sw2635B-ms98-a-0038 189.534500 191.569875 right we're uh
sw2635B-ms98-a-0039 191.569875 198.531625 you know we're supposedly on the leading edge of technology which uh that can be disputed i guess by a number of other countries
sw2635B-ms98-a-0040 198.531625 207.991375 um i do now that our rapid transit system uh is in terrible shape i mean most areas of the country we don't have anything
sw2635B-ms98-a-0041 207.991375 215.185375 where overseas uh they do their rail lines their their uh
sw2635B-ms98-a-0042 215.185375 219.091750 [vocalized-noise] their subways are in much better condition than ours
sw2635B-ms98-a-0043 219.091750 220.718125 if we put
sw2635B-ms98-a-0044 220.718125 224.444375 if we put a force to work in this country building
sw2635B-ms98-a-0045 224.444375 236.549875 a network of rapid transit systems you know just from say outlying districts of downtown especially California where the i saw a program on uh PBS last night they're saying the average
sw2635B-ms98-a-0046 236.549875 244.264000 the average speed on the California freeways now in southern California is thirty six miles an hour and it's roughly
sw2635B-ms98-a-0047 244.264000 248.800000 uh a two hour wait to get from the outskirts of downtown
sw2635B-ms98-a-0048 248.800000 252.717625 and they figure by five years the average speed is going to be eleven miles an hour
sw2635B-ms98-a-0049 252.717625 255.447500 that's that's atrocious
sw2635B-ms98-a-0050 255.447500 274.400000 [silence]
sw2635B-ms98-a-0051 274.400000 286.274750 we have we have a lot of people that are in college and we have a lot of people that [noise] for one reason or another that that can't get into college either they can't afford it or or perhaps they don't have the abilities
sw2635B-ms98-a-0052 286.274750 287.460250 [silence]
sw2635B-ms98-a-0053 287.460250 296.457250 that's all more manpower and and one of the ways where we're we were coping with that was they were going into the military and they were getting [noise] a semblance of an education
sw2635B-ms98-a-0054 296.457250 299.104375 now the military's laying off
sw2635B-ms98-a-0055 299.104375 307.681000 uh i think there should be mandatory that people that are not in school should at least get into some kind of a career program i mean they can help build the United States back up
sw2635B-ms98-a-0056 307.681000 317.924625 [silence]
sw2635B-ms98-a-0057 317.924625 319.001250 yeah
sw2635B-ms98-a-0058 319.001250 319.756375 [noise]
sw2635B-ms98-a-0059 319.756375 322.512750 [silence]
sw2635B-ms98-a-0060 322.512750 324.125125 and we've done
sw2635B-ms98-a-0061 324.125125 325.408750 we've sent
sw2635B-ms98-a-0062 325.408750 329.976125 people abroad and the people that do go abroad are are usually
sw2635B-ms98-a-0063 329.976125 331.035375 um
sw2635B-ms98-a-0064 331.035375 332.094500 [silence]
sw2635B-ms98-a-0065 332.094500 333.512250 college educated
sw2635B-ms98-a-0066 333.512250 340.870000 they're taking the knowledge that we have and bringing it with them which is which is fine because
sw2635B-ms98-a-0067 340.870000 348.000250 in the long run if we educate those people and we build up their economy they're going to want to buy products that we make
sw2635B-ms98-a-0068 348.000250 358.408500 s[o]- but i don't know if that if that is really taken place like the Philippines with the the massive corruption in there i mean a few people got it and the rest of didn't
sw2635B-ms98-a-0069 358.408500 370.081500 the Middle East same thing a few people got it and and the rest of them don't so in theory if you build up their economies and help these people yes it can work
sw2635B-ms98-a-0070 370.081500 373.511125 but the corruption at the top i think limits that
sw2635B-ms98-a-0071 373.511125 381.140250 [silence]
sw2635B-ms98-a-0072 381.140250 382.412125 yeah
sw2635B-ms98-a-0073 382.412125 384.163125 [silence]
sw2635B-ms98-a-0074 384.163125 388.485125 yeah i'm kind of uh a dreamer i guess i st[ill]- i still believe in
sw2635B-ms98-a-0075 388.485125 396.713500 we could put this country back to work we could bring the steel mills back in we could we could build our own rails we could we could create all kinds of jobs
sw2635B-ms98-a-0076 396.713500 398.785750 if we just had the incentive like 
sw2635B-ms98-a-0077 398.785750 400.528750 um 
sw2635B-ms98-a-0078 400.528750 403.033250 i'm not sure who started the national
sw2635B-ms98-a-0079 403.033250 405.976750 highway system you know the the freeways
sw2635B-ms98-a-0080 405.976750 407.302250 [silence]
sw2635B-ms98-a-0081 407.302250 417.535000 i don't know if it was if it was if it was Johnson or Kennedy or sometime before them the way they decided that yes we're going to have uh [vocalized-noise] i guess we've got some of the best roads in the world
sw2635B-ms98-a-0082 417.535000 422.357500 we could do that too i mean we could we could get a national program
sw2635B-ms98-a-0083 422.357500 427.098500 Kennedy had a national program to land uh a man on the moon
sw2635B-ms98-a-0084 427.098500 428.878250 and we did it
sw2635B-ms98-a-0085 428.878250 436.939375 s[o]- i- i think if we if we put our minds to it we can do just about anything we want yeah sounds like i'm on a soapbox [laughter]
sw2635B-ms98-a-0086 436.939375 439.815875 [silence]
sw2635B-ms98-a-0087 439.815875 445.474125 yeah there's i jus[t]- i just remember how it used to be and it seems like that
sw2635B-ms98-a-0088 445.474125 452.384875 everything's just deteriorating you know yo[u]- you can't go anywhere without waiting in line you can't um
sw2635B-ms98-a-0089 452.384875 469.361625 [silence]
sw2635B-ms98-a-0090 469.361625 471.579625 yeah it just seems to be a waste of time
sw2635B-ms98-a-0091 471.579625 475.579375 i mean it takes it takes longer and longer to get back and forth to work
sw2635B-ms98-a-0092 475.579375 485.956250 we're adding to the pollution in the in the world whether that's creating the greenhouse effect or not whether it is or not uh it's still being debated
sw2635B-ms98-a-0093 485.956250 499.869875 [silence]
sw2635B-ms98-a-0094 499.869875 500.968125 yeah
sw2635B-ms98-a-0095 500.968125 502.336625 [silence]
sw2635B-ms98-a-0096 502.336625 505.464625 it could the the main thing is um
sw2635B-ms98-a-0097 505.464625 506.971375 [silence]
sw2635B-ms98-a-0098 506.971375 509.713500 like you said earlier in the conversation
sw2635B-ms98-a-0099 509.713500 515.462125 if we make it a mandate and say you have to do it then we're going to create all kinds of problems
sw2635B-ms98-a-0100 515.462125 521.344375 but i don't see why we can't say that i don't see why we can't you know you contribute well
sw2635B-ms98-a-0101 521.344375 524.923500 you don't go to school well spend two years doing something
sw2635B-ms98-a-0102 524.923500 527.647125 [silence]
sw2635B-ms98-a-0103 527.647125 529.864750 we have a welfare system that
sw2635B-ms98-a-0104 529.864750 530.421875 [noise]
sw2635B-ms98-a-0105 530.421875 534.845875 is defeating itself because they get more money from welfare than they can working at
sw2635B-ms98-a-0106 534.845875 537.017125 ordinary jobs
sw2635B-ms98-a-0107 537.017125 539.985000 so what's the incentive for them to go to work
sw2635B-ms98-a-0108 539.985000 541.212750 [silence]
sw2635B-ms98-a-0109 541.212750 546.878625 the prison population right that's there's i don't know how many millions of people now are incarcerated
sw2635B-ms98-a-0110 546.878625 548.417625 [silence]
sw2635B-ms98-a-0111 548.417625 551.910125 which is uh which is a huge drain on society
sw2635B-ms98-a-0112 551.910125 553.953250 what do you do with those people
sw2635B-ms98-a-0113 553.953250 560.540000 [silence]
sw2635B-ms98-a-0114 560.540000 564.731375 yeah but are we really doing that educating i- i suppose some
sw2635B-ms98-a-0115 564.731375 574.477250 [silence]
sw2635B-ms98-a-0116 574.477250 576.147125 no
sw2635B-ms98-a-0117 576.147125 584.067375 [noise] that's right and as much as you say yes you know i've paid my debt to society and all that it's still there
sw2635B-ms98-a-0118 584.067375 588.844375 and they're going to be apprehensive and if you had to choose between one or the other
sw2635B-ms98-a-0119 588.844375 589.962500 [silence]
sw2635B-ms98-a-0120 589.962500 592.490500 you know you wou[ldn't]- you just wouldn't look at those people
sw2635B-ms98-a-0121 592.490500 598.793375 [silence]
