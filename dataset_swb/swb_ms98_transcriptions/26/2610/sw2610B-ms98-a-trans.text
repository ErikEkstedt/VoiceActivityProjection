sw2610B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.592375 [noise]
sw2610B-ms98-a-0002 0.592375 1.734750 [silence]
sw2610B-ms98-a-0003 1.734750 14.455000 oh i like it i i i have a foreign actually i have more than one foreign automobile and i i i find the uh i find the the nondecimal system with all the halves and quarters i was trying to build a shed
sw2610B-ms98-a-0004 14.455000 19.189625 and they give you these measurements like forty two and three eighths inches
sw2610B-ms98-a-0005 19.189625 24.081625 and we had to go a little less and trying to figure what's less than three eighths uh
sw2610B-ms98-a-0006 24.081625 30.483000 [silence]
sw2610B-ms98-a-0007 30.483000 39.673000 well no what we did was wind up using and you just go you just go down and and you get out the the so many inches and and we just marked a little bit less than that
sw2610B-ms98-a-0008 39.673000 53.374125 uh which is somewhat awkward but had it been millimeters you could have done i think what's interesting the way engineering people do is they they in essence have gotten around it by by listing uh decimal inches
sw2610B-ms98-a-0009 53.374125 54.424375 [silence]
sw2610B-ms98-a-0010 54.424375 58.542500 do you are you involved in any engineering drawing stuff that
sw2610B-ms98-a-0011 58.542500 76.548125 [silence]
sw2610B-ms98-a-0012 76.548125 81.956625 well have have you do you are you involved in any other uh metric type things like
sw2610B-ms98-a-0013 81.956625 94.390750 [silence]
sw2610B-ms98-a-0014 94.390750 104.584250 i think it's interesting you we[nt]- you know when you you go out there and you're looking for a wrench and you want the next size larger i've got i inherited some some stuff like fifteen thirty seconds
sw2610B-ms98-a-0015 104.584250 117.505000 well now that one's fairly easy because that's probably slightly under half an inch but some of them like like twenty seven and and there are some thirty seconds and some of the things that that uh don't translate
sw2610B-ms98-a-0016 117.505000 124.651000 [silence]
sw2610B-ms98-a-0017 124.651000 130.966875 yeah and and you've got to go over there and try it and i suppose you know i need a larger one i need a smaller one i mean obviously you can look at it and say well
sw2610B-ms98-a-0018 130.966875 139.889250 anyway i think the other thing that's interesting is that a lot of our stuff is already changed that we haven't i don't know do you do you drink adult beverages
sw2610B-ms98-a-0019 139.889250 144.937875 we[ll]- th[at]- have you noticed that um that a lot of the um a lot of
sw2610B-ms98-a-0020 144.937875 146.183250 yes
sw2610B-ms98-a-0021 146.183250 152.419250 [silence]
sw2610B-ms98-a-0022 152.419250 156.999875 it's like a fifth like fifths of whiskey i thought was always kind of strange
sw2610B-ms98-a-0023 156.999875 158.970000 what's a fifth of whiskey
sw2610B-ms98-a-0024 158.970000 160.886625 [laughter]
sw2610B-ms98-a-0025 160.886625 163.059000 it was a marketing ploy
sw2610B-ms98-a-0026 163.059000 164.854250 [silence]
sw2610B-ms98-a-0027 164.854250 172.505875 yeah but the idea was is that by with five fifths um they could uh they could uh they could sell five and and
sw2610B-ms98-a-0028 172.505875 177.130125 um it was [laughter] simply a ploy to to get people you know
sw2610B-ms98-a-0029 177.130125 185.166500 to buy to buy more for it's uh i find that interesting but it's like you know the the the the soda and this kind of things coming in
sw2610B-ms98-a-0030 185.166500 192.854750 one one liter bottles and um i i think it's kind of generational although i must admit that that i am not
sw2610B-ms98-a-0031 192.854750 199.069250 i ca[n]- i'm not conversant in saying you know that's three centimeters away i mean or or or
sw2610B-ms98-a-0032 199.069250 204.310500 [silence]
sw2610B-ms98-a-0033 204.310500 206.676875 yeah an[d]-
sw2610B-ms98-a-0034 206.676875 209.421375 it it it's hard to think though
sw2610B-ms98-a-0035 209.421375 213.185000 [silence]
sw2610B-ms98-a-0036 213.185000 222.521625 it's like a mill you know we we do uh um well we use a one mill bond wire or one point five mill con[ductive]- bond wire on on semiconductor devices
sw2610B-ms98-a-0037 222.521625 225.581625 and well what's a mill and [laughter]
sw2610B-ms98-a-0038 225.581625 241.041000 [silence]
sw2610B-ms98-a-0039 241.041000 242.195000 yeah
sw2610B-ms98-a-0040 242.195000 251.274500 [silence]
sw2610B-ms98-a-0041 251.274500 262.478625 don't you find that interesting uh that they that that they're doing that uh in any field for ho[w]- why why why pieces could you could you get any connection on which was metric and which wasn't
sw2610B-ms98-a-0042 262.478625 270.393750 [silence]
sw2610B-ms98-a-0043 270.393750 271.892750 oh okay
sw2610B-ms98-a-0044 271.892750 279.240625 [silence]
sw2610B-ms98-a-0045 279.240625 283.000750 the bolts were were Eng[lish]- were were English then
sw2610B-ms98-a-0046 283.000750 295.228125 [silence]
sw2610B-ms98-a-0047 295.228125 297.168500 now that's strange
sw2610B-ms98-a-0048 297.168500 314.607250 [silence]
sw2610B-ms98-a-0049 314.607250 316.616000 yeah uh-huh
sw2610B-ms98-a-0050 316.616000 319.704375 [silence]
sw2610B-ms98-a-0051 319.704375 321.079375 yeah
sw2610B-ms98-a-0052 321.079375 331.772125 essentially they do that though because if if you look at General Motors the size and and and of course Ford and Chrysler if they all went if they all went metric but in a sense um
sw2610B-ms98-a-0053 331.772125 339.437000 you know it's like when you a measurement though when when you put uh you know one point four three two inches whe[n]- when you're milling something
sw2610B-ms98-a-0054 339.437000 348.743875 uh you simply set your uh equipment or or you measu[re]- or you got your calipers there and and you measure you know you [vocalized-noise] it to see if it's accurate and
sw2610B-ms98-a-0055 348.743875 350.090000 and
sw2610B-ms98-a-0056 350.090000 351.503000 no
sw2610B-ms98-a-0057 351.503000 354.995500 [silence]
sw2610B-ms98-a-0058 354.995500 356.283125 yeah
sw2610B-ms98-a-0059 356.283125 360.284000 [silence]
sw2610B-ms98-a-0060 360.284000 361.565875 yeah
sw2610B-ms98-a-0061 361.565875 365.549500 [silence]
sw2610B-ms98-a-0062 365.549500 370.997250 you get you a pair of metric pliers right [laughter] and you beat on it and a metric hammer [laughter]
sw2610B-ms98-a-0063 370.997250 379.608125 [silence]
sw2610B-ms98-a-0064 379.608125 394.212500 oh i think i don't think so i i think that th[at]- uh i think they've now just taken the attitude that well if it happens if it because it there a lot of things that that uh um like sports you know it's a hundred meter
sw2610B-ms98-a-0065 394.212500 402.065000 and uh uh but automobile races if it i don't think they'd ever it's still going to be the Indianapolis Five Hundred they're not going to
sw2610B-ms98-a-0066 402.065000 404.341500 [silence]
sw2610B-ms98-a-0067 404.341500 416.470875 yeah and and it i i don't think it i don't you know i don't think i don't think it's particularly bothersome because in reality uh you it's like troy ounces in ounces of gold how many ounces of gold
sw2610B-ms98-a-0068 416.470875 423.659625 you know i was trying i was trying to figure up gold content on something it had has uh gold plated uh header
sw2610B-ms98-a-0069 423.659625 426.952250 and and they're trying to think of what's a Troy ounce
sw2610B-ms98-a-0070 426.952250 428.708500 [silence]
sw2610B-ms98-a-0071 428.708500 431.130625 yeah now that makes you know
sw2610B-ms98-a-0072 431.130625 434.069250 [silence]
sw2610B-ms98-a-0073 434.069250 439.358250 well i mean and and then there's a metric ton and then there's a ton but what's a metric ton
sw2610B-ms98-a-0074 439.358250 441.301000 i don't know [laughter]
sw2610B-ms98-a-0075 441.301000 448.223875 [silence]
sw2610B-ms98-a-0076 448.223875 456.014250 yeah and and then but then the medicine and and some of these other things and and the chemistry in those kinds of areas milliliter
sw2610B-ms98-a-0077 456.014250 464.080250 yeah and and so um but but when you go to order a drink um you know well you say they they i don't know it's uh
sw2610B-ms98-a-0078 464.080250 466.311125 [silence]
sw2610B-ms98-a-0079 466.311125 480.999875 i don't know and and but you know when you go to the store and and you're trying to figure you know well this box is is uh is is twelve ounces and and this one's uh uh three pounds um and you
sw2610B-ms98-a-0080 480.999875 482.432875 yeah
sw2610B-ms98-a-0081 482.432875 485.217875 [silence]
sw2610B-ms98-a-0082 485.217875 486.535000 that's right
sw2610B-ms98-a-0083 486.535000 487.891125 and and [laughter]
sw2610B-ms98-a-0084 487.891125 495.528875 i don't know i i think that i i think i think the Federal government is going to more or less leave it alone i think they've got i think there are more pressing problems
sw2610B-ms98-a-0085 495.528875 496.802875 [silence]
sw2610B-ms98-a-0086 496.802875 498.162750 yes
sw2610B-ms98-a-0087 498.162750 508.831750 [silence]
sw2610B-ms98-a-0088 508.831750 515.886125 yeah but but are are the tools that uh if you're cutting are you talking about cutting equipment or tools for tha[t]- for set up
sw2610B-ms98-a-0089 515.886125 530.811125 [silence]
sw2610B-ms98-a-0090 530.811125 531.815625 huh
sw2610B-ms98-a-0091 531.815625 557.690500 [silence]
sw2610B-ms98-a-0092 557.690500 562.935375 so you've got thousands of dollars or so i mean you get a thousand dollars worth of tools
sw2610B-ms98-a-0093 562.935375 564.284000 yes
sw2610B-ms98-a-0094 564.284000 567.514625 [silence]
sw2610B-ms98-a-0095 567.514625 572.882000 but i was thinking about though that that when you actually get to the milling equipment though when it starts turning
sw2610B-ms98-a-0096 572.882000 580.412625 [silence]
sw2610B-ms98-a-0097 580.412625 581.996625 yeah
sw2610B-ms98-a-0098 581.996625 587.969875 but whe[n]- you when you when you simply drilling a hole i mean a real simple thing like gee i need a hole there
sw2610B-ms98-a-0099 587.969875 589.463125 yeah
sw2610B-ms98-a-0100 589.463125 590.870625 yeah
sw2610B-ms98-a-0101 590.870625 593.845250 [silence]
sw2610B-ms98-a-0102 593.845250 599.900875 yeah and and what but the thing is then you've got to with screws and that's the other issue uh the pitch and
