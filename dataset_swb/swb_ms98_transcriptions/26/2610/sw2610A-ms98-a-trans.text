sw2610A-ms98-a-0048 233.785625 241.773625 we have a eighty nine Chevy Blazer and before that we had a Horizon uh you know Plymouth Horizon
sw2610A-ms98-a-0049 241.773625 242.954375 and
sw2610A-ms98-a-0050 242.954375 244.793625 both of

sw2610A-ms98-a-0053 249.817750 251.897625 American and metric

sw2610A-ms98-a-0055 261.961250 267.353875 uh okay the engine itself was mostly metric
sw2610A-ms98-a-0056 267.353875 268.856000 [silence]
sw2610A-ms98-a-0057 268.856000 270.899875 because it came from Canada

sw2610A-ms98-a-0063 283.858500 292.352750 it was it was annoying one one half of the starter wa[s]- you know three bolts on the starter and two of them were
sw2610A-ms98-a-0064 292.352750 296.115625 American and one of them was metric
sw2610A-ms98-a-0065 296.115625 298.071875 and uh
sw2610A-ms98-a-0066 298.071875 302.257000 you go from the uh water pump up to the
sw2610A-ms98-a-0067 302.257000 305.049375 radiator and on the
sw2610A-ms98-a-0068 305.049375 306.455625 water pump

sw2610A-ms98-a-0078 348.303250 355.849000 right it's it's not a problem either way like i said my only complaint is where they mixed them on the same car
sw2610A-ms98-a-0079 355.849000 361.571875 and you go to look at it and you don't know which set to reach in American or metric
sw2610A-ms98-a-0080 361.571875 362.771500 and
sw2610A-ms98-a-0081 362.771500 365.968875 and you're never quite sure well is that a metric bolt
