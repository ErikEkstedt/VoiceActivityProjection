sw2656B-ms98-a-0002 3.341000 16.582500 well pretty much uh the thing i'm into mostly is new age uh like Yanni um oh uh Peter Barden uh
sw2656B-ms98-a-0003 16.582500 18.271125 [silence]
sw2656B-ms98-a-0004 18.271125 32.201750 gosh there's just so many of them i can't even can't even name them all Enya i just got a catalog just now as a matter of fact uh actually my husband got it uh Lady Slipper Catalog and it's it has music from a lot of women
sw2656B-ms98-a-0005 32.201750 37.037250 and it's got uh Enya in it and Carol Nessin have you ever heard of her
sw2656B-ms98-a-0006 37.037250 45.196000 [silence]
sw2656B-ms98-a-0007 45.196000 51.054375 well actually most of the music that i listen to there's no theme it's it's instrumental
sw2656B-ms98-a-0008 51.054375 64.323875 um and i tend to like instrumental better because there isn't that underlying theme there's no message to be get to be gotten there um it's just enjoying the melody
sw2656B-ms98-a-0009 64.323875 66.548750 that's that's what i like about music
sw2656B-ms98-a-0010 66.548750 71.857125 [silence]
sw2656B-ms98-a-0011 71.857125 80.646375 well um i guess you could tend to categorize some of the stuff like i like in into jazz uh Jean Luc Ponty
sw2656B-ms98-a-0012 80.646375 90.485500 is he's kinds of a he's he's jazz but he's kind of more of a contemporary type jazz he's got the um the electric violin
sw2656B-ms98-a-0013 90.485500 92.278750 um
sw2656B-ms98-a-0014 92.278750 93.336250 [silence]
sw2656B-ms98-a-0015 93.336250 102.427125 um my husband just said [laughter] before i switched to this other phone he said so you like the Dixie Dregs and that's is another one of my favorite groups
sw2656B-ms98-a-0016 102.427125 107.203625 but it's they're kind of in a group by themselves really
sw2656B-ms98-a-0017 107.203625 109.658000 they're more they're more like progressive
sw2656B-ms98-a-0018 109.658000 115.977250 [silence]
sw2656B-ms98-a-0019 115.977250 127.012875 um no progressive music is more like they have real complex um uh rhythms and key uh key changes
sw2656B-ms98-a-0020 127.012875 128.761500 um
sw2656B-ms98-a-0021 128.761500 141.211125 it's it's a more complex it's it's not your your typical top forty type that has um it'll it'll be in a particular key or whatever and i[t]- it doesn't change
sw2656B-ms98-a-0022 141.211125 145.472125 um progressive has a lot of different um
sw2656B-ms98-a-0023 145.472125 148.700250 i don't know it's it's a lot more complex
sw2656B-ms98-a-0024 148.700250 155.995125 [silence]
sw2656B-ms98-a-0025 155.995125 159.610875 no no uh that's really
sw2656B-ms98-a-0026 159.610875 170.476875 a lot of groups don't like to be called new age because it's kind of a a label that it it kind of kind of connotates the out of body experience like the
sw2656B-ms98-a-0027 170.476875 175.152500 um Shirley MacLaine type thing and that's not it at all
sw2656B-ms98-a-0028 175.152500 176.780250 it's it's just
sw2656B-ms98-a-0029 176.780250 179.766125 a different type of music and i guess
sw2656B-ms98-a-0030 179.766125 183.349375 um i guess you would really call it contemporary jazz
sw2656B-ms98-a-0031 183.349375 189.009125 [silence]
sw2656B-ms98-a-0032 189.009125 192.221625 i think so um do you ever listen to one oh six
sw2656B-ms98-a-0033 192.221625 193.232750 [silence]
sw2656B-ms98-a-0034 193.232750 194.588500 um
sw2656B-ms98-a-0035 194.588500 205.437625 um they play some of the stuff that i like although they've gotten th[em]- they've gotten to a lot more into the saxophone stuff and i don't really care a whole lot for saxophone like um Kenny G
sw2656B-ms98-a-0036 205.437625 216.805750 he's okay but um i like more of a variety and it seems like they are playing all of this saxophone type music that enough is enough [laughter] you can only handle so much of it
sw2656B-ms98-a-0037 216.805750 218.950625 [silence]
sw2656B-ms98-a-0038 218.950625 222.102125 well yeah he's kind of a new age
sw2656B-ms98-a-0039 222.102125 224.264875 kind of a jazz new age
sw2656B-ms98-a-0040 224.264875 226.861500 it kind of kind of depends on how you look at it
sw2656B-ms98-a-0041 226.861500 230.059250 [silence]

sw2656B-ms98-a-0059 295.878625 304.581250 like his first two albums were really good they're real real you know nitty gritty down to the i mean real roots of rock and roll and i really liked that
sw2656B-ms98-a-0060 304.581250 313.900625 when he got to [vocalized-noise] doing his um um didn't he do a he did an album with who was it Stevie Nicks i think
