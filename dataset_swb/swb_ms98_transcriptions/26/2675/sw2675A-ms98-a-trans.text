sw2675A-ms98-a-0011 58.701250 64.342250 i do you think a lot of people when they are listening to a trial put themselves
sw2675A-ms98-a-0012 64.342250 75.250000 in a position like that and say i would never do something like that and it's hard for them to believe that somebody else could do the things that have been done

sw2675A-ms98-a-0022 104.995000 110.490250 uh-huh uh do they have such a thing now as a six man jury
sw2675A-ms98-a-0023 110.490250 118.983750 somebody told me the other day that there is wha[t]- what they call a six man jury and i had never heard of such thing and i wondered if it was true

sw2675A-ms98-a-0025 121.219000 132.981375 i never had either but i just wondered uh another question was uh should a criminal case uh should the jury be unanimous on their decision
sw2675A-ms98-a-0026 132.981375 138.493875 and that i wasn't sure on either whether it should be unanimous or not

sw2675A-ms98-a-0028 148.970000 153.238875 that would mean they all would have to decide

sw2675A-ms98-a-0040 189.479000 198.494750 uh apparently there are i i i since my husband worked as a policeman i can't believe there are very many
sw2675A-ms98-a-0041 198.494750 208.107875 people that come to trial that have are not guilty of something some part of whatever they're accused of i have i still have a little bit of a problem with that
sw2675A-ms98-a-0042 208.107875 218.587750 uh but i would suppose there are circumstances you're in the wrong place at the right time or know the per[son]- wrong person at the right time

sw2675A-ms98-a-0063 289.776625 301.257500 no huh-uh yeah i guess that's where a lot of the problem lies we're we tr[y]- bend over backwards protecting the guilty people the one's that are on trial
sw2675A-ms98-a-0064 301.257500 303.860000 and yeah
sw2675A-ms98-a-0065 303.860000 308.776375 and we often forget about the one that the injustice has been done to
sw2675A-ms98-a-0066 308.776375 314.474000 because i bet they still say our system is the best in the world

sw2675A-ms98-a-0094 428.997750 434.993875 [silence]
sw2675A-ms98-a-0095 434.993875 442.493375 make a recommendation do they sometimes make a recommendation that's what i was thinking they they sometimes do

sw2675A-ms98-a-0099 451.446750 460.504875 and they recommend some yeah and then the judge has the final decision on what does really happen

sw2675A-ms98-a-0104 471.259000 485.993125 well i think that's where a lot of people think boy they're getting put away for a long time but actually their chance course when a lot of times when they come up for a parole they're denied it depends on you know what they're what they'd been guilty of and
sw2675A-ms98-a-0105 485.993125 489.132000 and a lot of different things i guess
sw2675A-ms98-a-0106 489.132000 491.774625 [silence]
sw2675A-ms98-a-0107 491.774625 501.982875 um-hum a lot slip through the the protective whatever they have to do and and there are bad ones that do slip back out and
sw2675A-ms98-a-0108 501.982875 505.259250 end up hurting somebody again

sw2675A-ms98-a-0112 514.743875 523.722500 um-hum i always thought there was it was wrong it seems sometimes that like somebody who is stealing a loaf of bread to feed his family 
sw2675A-ms98-a-0113 523.722500 535.498125 got more jail sentence than somebody maybe that killed somebody it seemed like there sometimes there's not a good the balance isn't right it doesn't make sense
