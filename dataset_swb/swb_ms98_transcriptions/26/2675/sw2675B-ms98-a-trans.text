sw2675B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.296500 [noise]
sw2675B-ms98-a-0002 0.296500 1.696500 there you go
sw2675B-ms98-a-0003 1.696500 9.499375 w[ell]- well Jean the subject is uh jury trials and should the jury recommend
sw2675B-ms98-a-0004 9.499375 11.712500 uh sentencing
sw2675B-ms98-a-0005 11.712500 14.478750 uh
sw2675B-ms98-a-0006 14.478750 21.203875 now my personal opinion uh i don't know uh uh here lately it seems
sw2675B-ms98-a-0007 21.203875 30.958250 well up until a few years ago i guess there there w[as]- uh there just too many liberals about and permitting too many
sw2675B-ms98-a-0008 30.958250 39.947375 oh they just broaden the the human rights in [vocalized-noise] to to cover just about e[verybody]- everybody and i don't think uh 
sw2675B-ms98-a-0009 39.947375 52.995250 those guilty of committing capital crimes should be uh permitted to go spend a few years in jail and be turned loose on parole it's just not right
sw2675B-ms98-a-0010 52.995250 54.746250 [silence]
sw2675B-ms98-a-0011 54.746250 59.474500 and therefore i think juries should be able to recommend sentencing
sw2675B-ms98-a-0012 59.474500 74.302000 [silence]
sw2675B-ms98-a-0013 74.302000 86.866250 uh yes very possibly so many of us have l[ed]- led sheltered lives that uh when we go into a sit in on a a a jury i've never done it myself
sw2675B-ms98-a-0014 86.866250 90.309125 unfortunately i wish i could have
sw2675B-ms98-a-0015 90.309125 93.999375 i've just never been called up
sw2675B-ms98-a-0016 93.999375 97.724875 [silence]
sw2675B-ms98-a-0017 97.724875 100.266125 well now that's possible
sw2675B-ms98-a-0018 100.266125 106.020500 but uh i was called up as an an alternate once but i never made it to the jury
sw2675B-ms98-a-0019 106.020500 109.719750 [silence]
sw2675B-ms98-a-0020 109.719750 111.830375 not that i know of
sw2675B-ms98-a-0021 111.830375 118.100625 [silence]
sw2675B-ms98-a-0022 118.100625 119.987000 uh-huh
sw2675B-ms98-a-0023 119.987000 122.985250 uh i've never heard of it
sw2675B-ms98-a-0024 122.985250 137.459250 [silence]
sw2675B-ms98-a-0025 137.459250 145.240875 [noise] uh well there again uh
sw2675B-ms98-a-0026 145.240875 146.763375 [silence]
sw2675B-ms98-a-0027 146.763375 149.268000 i suppose it should be
sw2675B-ms98-a-0028 149.268000 152.723375 [silence]
sw2675B-ms98-a-0029 152.723375 154.278375 e[xactly]- exactly
sw2675B-ms98-a-0030 154.278375 163.996750 is it guilt or innocence but then again so many times uh you get one or two holdouts and and it permits the criminals to get a retrial
sw2675B-ms98-a-0031 163.996750 165.025500 [silence]
sw2675B-ms98-a-0032 165.025500 172.722750 and now tha[t]- that's not too bad in this sense because you might get someone in their that's a victim of circumstances i mean that's happened
sw2675B-ms98-a-0033 172.722750 173.768250 [silence]
sw2675B-ms98-a-0034 173.768250 182.482000 and uh giving them ano[ther]- a[nother]- another trial might give them additional time to uh prove their innocence
sw2675B-ms98-a-0035 182.482000 190.497000 yes uh we can't overlook the fact that there are innocent people that do get involved in jury trials
sw2675B-ms98-a-0036 190.497000 201.984625 [silence]
sw2675B-ms98-a-0037 201.984625 203.985875 hum

sw2675B-ms98-a-0040 215.477250 219.994500 oh that's it and you just might resemble somebody
sw2675B-ms98-a-0041 219.994500 222.276125 uh
sw2675B-ms98-a-0042 222.276125 225.778500 out here in Texas we had a a a a a 
sw2675B-ms98-a-0043 225.778500 232.487625 great miscarriage of justice here it was finally after nine years it was finally uh
sw2675B-ms98-a-0044 232.487625 246.998625 uh uh taken care of we had a a a black man was accused simply because he resembled uh someone who stuck who who held up a uh a a 7-Eleven i think it was
sw2675B-ms98-a-0045 246.998625 248.236750 [silence]
sw2675B-ms98-a-0046 248.236750 258.697875 and even though he had witnesses that said that uh he was at work and he had all sorts of of a uh character witnesses and whatnot
sw2675B-ms98-a-0047 258.697875 260.462000 th[ey]-
sw2675B-ms98-a-0048 260.462000 262.699250 they found him guilty
sw2675B-ms98-a-0049 262.699250 263.704875 [silence]
sw2675B-ms98-a-0050 263.704875 272.999250 well they said it w[as]- that this happened during lunch time and he could have disapp[eared]- uh gotten away at lunch time and uh committed the robbery
sw2675B-ms98-a-0051 272.999250 284.998625 but after nine years well as a matter of fact they made a TV show about it after nine years they finally uh came up with evidence and prove[d]- to prove that he was innocent
sw2675B-ms98-a-0052 284.998625 287.483000 [silence]
sw2675B-ms98-a-0053 287.483000 291.994125 exactly now that just was not fair
sw2675B-ms98-a-0054 291.994125 293.696250 so

sw2675B-ms98-a-0056 299.997750 304.493500 yes unfortunately that's what happens

sw2675B-ms98-a-0058 314.489250 321.486625 well it's not the uh uh i[t's]- i[t's]- it's not the best system but it's the best one in the world
sw2675B-ms98-a-0059 321.486625 322.653125 [silence]

sw2675B-ms98-a-0091 446.826750 455.493250 but uh i know i'm always hearing that uh well the jury came in with a g[uilty]- guilty verdict and they recommended uh twenty years or something
sw2675B-ms98-a-0092 455.493250 456.994250 [silence]
sw2675B-ms98-a-0093 456.994250 458.490500 yes

sw2675B-ms98-a-0095 460.735750 472.499625 of course uh now the jury may not be completely aware of all the ramifications of a sentence uh they may not know that if you give him twenty years he can get out in five
sw2675B-ms98-a-0096 472.499625 481.993875 [silence]

sw2675B-ms98-a-0101 503.497375 507.287250 yes they just go out and repeat their crimes
sw2675B-ms98-a-0102 507.287250 516.400625 well there well they say a[fter]- after three offenses why it's automatically life in prison but i think they ought to make it two offenses
