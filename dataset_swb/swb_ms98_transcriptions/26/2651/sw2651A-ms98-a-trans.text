sw2651A-ms98-a-0027 103.624000 109.455125 it's uh it's a salt box that's a it's a New England 
sw2651A-ms98-a-0028 109.455125 110.620000 type
sw2651A-ms98-a-0029 110.620000 116.744125 uh i was born and brought up in the area that that i lived in and it was very rural and there was nothing there but uh
sw2651A-ms98-a-0030 116.744125 117.276625 [noise]
sw2651A-ms98-a-0031 117.276625 119.704500 uh farms
sw2651A-ms98-a-0032 119.704500 128.057875 uh or orchards one or the other you know there was a lot of apple orchards so when we decided to build we built
sw2651A-ms98-a-0033 128.057875 137.490625 uh about thirteen years ago uh we looked for a home and the things that we were seeing were 
sw2651A-ms98-a-0034 137.490625 145.207125 uh not up to my standards they were still building homes back then like they have for
sw2651A-ms98-a-0035 145.207125 152.340250 a hundred and fifty years you know the very little insulation in the walls and very little insulation in the ceiling so
sw2651A-ms98-a-0036 152.340250 155.795625 yeah and it was uh
sw2651A-ms98-a-0037 155.795625 156.909625 [silence]
sw2651A-ms98-a-0038 156.909625 164.965375 it wasn't what we wanted so we did some research and i knew the land there's a lot of ledge up here so you have to be careful
sw2651A-ms98-a-0039 164.965375 170.954625 uh their septic systems when there's no uh uh public sewer system
sw2651A-ms98-a-0040 170.954625 181.060250 there is water however so we picked out a piece of land that we liked and we bought it and then we decided to build so we we did a lot of research like i said and we 
sw2651A-ms98-a-0041 181.060250 187.947375 and we built a typical New England salt box in the area and when we built we were the first home there there was like about
sw2651A-ms98-a-0042 187.947375 191.032625 ten acres of oak forest around us
sw2651A-ms98-a-0043 191.032625 199.930000 and it was absolutely gorgeous uh since then however they've torn it all down and we're surrounded by homes you know that's a that's another long story but 
sw2651A-ms98-a-0044 199.930000 211.744625 we're the only typical New England home in the area there's a lot of there's an English Tudor right next to us and there's uh there's a colonial our street's on just a short street there's only like six homes on it 
sw2651A-ms98-a-0045 211.744625 221.450250 and there's a uh an English colonial down on the corner and the rest are raised ranches and you know the typical uh home
sw2651A-ms98-a-0046 221.450250 229.464750 but we built ours um [noise] we made uh we did it ourselves uh i sent uh uh
sw2651A-ms98-a-0047 229.464750 241.777625 some rough plans out to an architect to have him draw it up and then i subbed out the things that i couldn't do like i had a crew come in and frame it and i did the rest i did the inside the wiring the plumbing and uh you know
sw2651A-ms98-a-0048 241.777625 242.837250 [silence]
sw2651A-ms98-a-0049 242.837250 246.561625 so we built the walls huh
sw2651A-ms98-a-0050 246.561625 253.309125 uh my dad had built a couple when we were growing up so kind of got used to it and we did a lot of research
sw2651A-ms98-a-0051 253.309125 258.424375 [silence]
sw2651A-ms98-a-0052 258.424375 260.151250 uh
sw2651A-ms98-a-0053 260.151250 261.452375 [noise]
sw2651A-ms98-a-0054 261.452375 269.570625 we made the kitchen a working kitchen i think i would've made the kitchen uh a lot bigger because both of us like to cook
sw2651A-ms98-a-0055 269.570625 273.430125 and right now a working kitchen is very efficient but
sw2651A-ms98-a-0056 273.430125 284.014250 two people kind of get in each other's way yeah it's similar to a galley kitchen yeah and then we have uh a like a little dining area off that we have a formal dining room
sw2651A-ms98-a-0057 284.014250 293.140250 um i've since added onto the house we've got like uh uh looks like an old rustic uh log cabin on the inside
sw2651A-ms98-a-0058 293.140250 300.645125 uh it's all natural wood the ceiling's pine the walls are pine you know it's uh one of those type kick around rooms
sw2651A-ms98-a-0059 300.645125 306.087750 and we put a greenhouse on it it was uh designed to be heated by the sun
sw2651A-ms98-a-0060 306.087750 307.676875 [silence]
sw2651A-ms98-a-0061 307.676875 312.151125 um it works fine as long as you don't put any plants in it
sw2651A-ms98-a-0062 312.151125 314.369500 yes
sw2651A-ms98-a-0063 314.369500 316.246875 oh are you
sw2651A-ms98-a-0064 316.246875 317.882250 oh
sw2651A-ms98-a-0065 317.882250 319.690000 we raise orchids
sw2651A-ms98-a-0066 319.690000 320.797375 [silence]
sw2651A-ms98-a-0067 320.797375 328.751750 which is a little bit tough to do up here in the north but it's a solar greenhouse we put up you know like the walls are six inches thick
sw2651A-ms98-a-0068 328.751750 330.031000 [silence]
sw2651A-ms98-a-0069 330.031000 337.539125 no no we we we used uh fiberglass uh we're face[d]- the the greenhouse faces solar south 
sw2651A-ms98-a-0070 337.539125 343.273000 and it's it's double glazed fiberglass with a one inch airspace in between it
sw2651A-ms98-a-0071 343.273000 354.763000 so it's kind of opaque we don't use shading on it um [noise] but we do have to uh have air a lot of air movement even in the wintertime it can get uh brutally hot in there
sw2651A-ms98-a-0072 354.763000 357.892625 so the way it was designed was to uh
sw2651A-ms98-a-0073 357.892625 364.345375 uh i put a four foot foundation under it and put in twenty two ton of rock with with uh hot air piped through it
sw2651A-ms98-a-0074 364.345375 369.905375 and all day long it just heats up and then at night it just gives it back into the house
sw2651A-ms98-a-0075 369.905375 375.014750 so it's it's not bad it's it's uh [noise]
sw2651A-ms98-a-0076 375.014750 384.076500 i'd like a little bit warm land i'd like to go up further north and i'd like to instead of having a salt box i'd like to have it all on on one floor
sw2651A-ms98-a-0077 384.076500 392.060250 [silence]
sw2651A-ms98-a-0078 392.060250 397.790625 that's right [vocalized-noise] you guys must yeah because the actually the winter hasn't been really bad
sw2651A-ms98-a-0079 397.790625 401.656500 [silence]
sw2651A-ms98-a-0080 401.656500 404.171625 so you got your garden planted
sw2651A-ms98-a-0081 404.171625 408.593000 yeah sir [laughter]
sw2651A-ms98-a-0082 408.593000 414.771250 it's it's probably gotten just a little bit too warm now we have trouble up here with uh uh
sw2651A-ms98-a-0083 414.771250 421.601125 [silence]
sw2651A-ms98-a-0084 421.601125 425.924375 yeah no i uh i put down black plastic
sw2651A-ms98-a-0085 425.924375 434.745875 [noise] to help heat it up you know put it on the radishes and spinach but spinach kind of bolts quick on us so we put it Swiss chard instead yeah
sw2651A-ms98-a-0086 434.745875 442.633625 so anyhow that's what we've done for our house we've left it all natural so there's no upkeep you know it's white cedar shingle
sw2651A-ms98-a-0087 442.633625 446.858500 and the trim is stained so i don't have to go out and scrape and paint
sw2651A-ms98-a-0088 446.858500 447.889375 [silence]
sw2651A-ms98-a-0089 447.889375 452.447875 because i figured when i got old and retire i don't want to be working i don't be a slave to the home
sw2651A-ms98-a-0090 452.447875 454.713250 [silence]
sw2651A-ms98-a-0091 454.713250 464.342875 um right right because that peek is twenty eight feet high and you come off twenty eight feet and it hurts so
sw2651A-ms98-a-0092 464.342875 466.955250 [silence]
sw2651A-ms98-a-0093 466.955250 468.767250 yes you too
sw2651A-ms98-a-0094 468.767250 470.897500 [silence]
