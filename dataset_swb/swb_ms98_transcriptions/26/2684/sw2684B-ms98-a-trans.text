sw2684B-ms98-a-0007 30.755500 34.587625 and i can see that point but i also have this you know i
sw2684B-ms98-a-0008 34.587625 39.323875 i question i guess i can look at it both ways and just to play devil's advocate
sw2684B-ms98-a-0009 39.323875 46.418000 it never seems right to me that uh we take in people that are criminals and people that are you know
sw2684B-ms98-a-0010 46.418000 52.400000 low income or even middle income that are struggling to provide for their families
sw2684B-ms98-a-0011 52.400000 56.317250 our taxes are paying to feed and shelter those people and it just
sw2684B-ms98-a-0012 56.317250 59.949375 that that i find very difficult to swallow sometimes

sw2684B-ms98-a-0025 96.786875 102.145375 and then when you think of the thousands and thousands of dollars that get burned in court costs
sw2684B-ms98-a-0026 102.145375 106.464750 you know we could be pay[ing]- feeding poor people and helping you know
sw2684B-ms98-a-0027 106.464750 112.711625 helping the environment i mean prison is such a waste of

sw2684B-ms98-a-0029 113.766500 121.476500 a human being it doesn't do anyone any good yes people need to be punished and i do agree with your statement
sw2684B-ms98-a-0030 121.476500 124.719750 that to take a human life is wrong
sw2684B-ms98-a-0031 124.719750 129.869375 um but you know locking someone up and not getting
sw2684B-ms98-a-0032 129.869375 135.124500 you know any benefit from that for the person or for society to me is wrong too

sw2684B-ms98-a-0044 185.149625 189.576625 we want a safe environment for ourselves and we want to remove them
sw2684B-ms98-a-0045 189.576625 196.513875 but but i think that the whole crux of the problem is no one has come up with a solution
sw2684B-ms98-a-0046 196.513875 200.368875 that is acceptable that does you know
sw2684B-ms98-a-0047 200.368875 205.673625 basically you know i i think you know that the whole idea of
sw2684B-ms98-a-0048 205.673625 212.439000 uh a a death penalty was invented for two reasons it remo[ves]- -[re]moves them from society
sw2684B-ms98-a-0049 212.439000 217.904750 and number two it's it's kind of uh it's the punishment it's the ultimate punishment
sw2684B-ms98-a-0050 217.904750 220.980125 because you know they've harmed someone and and
sw2684B-ms98-a-0051 220.980125 222.923375 you know you want to
sw2684B-ms98-a-0052 222.923375 226.337750 appease the people that have suffered
sw2684B-ms98-a-0053 226.337750 227.392625 but it
sw2684B-ms98-a-0054 227.392625 230.034250 it really doesn't take their pain away

sw2684B-ms98-a-0060 255.808125 265.889750 exactly but that the [pob/problem] the problem is so incredibly complex i have a friend who works on the pardon and [patr/parole] paro[le]- paroles and she interviews
sw2684B-ms98-a-0061 265.889750 272.419875 inmates all the time that are coming up for parole and she says it is just really frightening
sw2684B-ms98-a-0062 272.419875 279.198000 how easy it is to you know have the prisons release people because they're overcrowded
sw2684B-ms98-a-0063 279.198000 281.396250 and these people have not
sw2684B-ms98-a-0064 281.396250 284.365250 benefited from the stay there she says
sw2684B-ms98-a-0065 284.365250 292.051375 just their emotional state and their way of thinking is so incredibly wrong
sw2684B-ms98-a-0066 292.051375 297.728750 and there's not anything she can do to keep them in you know if they meet certain guidelines
sw2684B-ms98-a-0067 297.728750 303.825250 you know and those guidelines keep getting lessened and lessened because they have to do it to make the system work
sw2684B-ms98-a-0068 303.825250 304.900875 so it's
