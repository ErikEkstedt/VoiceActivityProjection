sw2684A-ms98-a-0003 3.090500 8.965250 uh my first thoughts on capital punishment i[s]- i the first thing i want to say i[s]- is no
sw2684A-ms98-a-0004 8.965250 15.270125 just simply because we as human beings don't have the right to take another human being's life
sw2684A-ms98-a-0005 15.270125 16.498250 uh
sw2684A-ms98-a-0006 16.498250 20.468750 we are punishing someone for taking someone's life
sw2684A-ms98-a-0007 20.468750 28.041875 or in some cases we are punishing s[omeone]- -[some]one a person for taking someone's life and so in effect we're committing that same crime

sw2684A-ms98-a-0022 71.507500 79.933375 right okay and there are thousands upon thousands of people on death row and i'm not saying that
sw2684A-ms98-a-0023 79.933375 85.604250 well i guess i am kind of saying what what are we doing i mean i guess that's the same thing you were saying
sw2684A-ms98-a-0024 85.604250 87.580500 what what are we doing with these people
sw2684A-ms98-a-0025 87.580500 92.011000 they're they're there we should either take some kind of action

sw2684A-ms98-a-0043 141.258625 148.462625 i also agree that i mean if there's somebody out there that's crazy and cruel enough
sw2684A-ms98-a-0044 148.462625 158.556125 to kill somebody or in some cases kill several people at one time uh there was a case in Dallas well i'm sure they haven't gone to court yet but
sw2684A-ms98-a-0045 158.556125 167.216375 uh apparently two teenage boys held up a Taco Bell they put four people in a freezer and shot them_1 all
sw2684A-ms98-a-0046 167.216375 170.464875 now to me that is inhumane
sw2684A-ms98-a-0047 170.464875 171.912750 and
sw2684A-ms98-a-0048 171.912750 178.118500 for two people to be out in the world like that i don't i don't want them in my world

sw2684A-ms98-a-0050 180.825125 183.289375 i mean i'm not for killing anyone
sw2684A-ms98-a-0051 183.289375 186.743750 but i don't want these people around at the same time
