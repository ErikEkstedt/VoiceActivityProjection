sw2668A-ms98-a-0019 86.358500 88.819000 what what state are you from Carla
sw2668A-ms98-a-0020 88.819000 95.595125 Indiana you had a state income tax there are you able to credit that against your federal income tax
sw2668A-ms98-a-0021 95.595125 103.410000 [silence]
sw2668A-ms98-a-0022 103.410000 106.705000 oh okay so you do get some credit but not the whole thing
sw2668A-ms98-a-0023 106.705000 108.122625 okay because_1
sw2668A-ms98-a-0024 108.122625 116.158250 [silence]
sw2668A-ms98-a-0025 116.158250 117.779250 oh i see
sw2668A-ms98-a-0026 117.779250 122.370875 okay what uh uh what generally what percent of your income is it
sw2668A-ms98-a-0027 122.370875 125.336000 [silence]
sw2668A-ms98-a-0028 125.336000 128.030000 oh okay okay
sw2668A-ms98-a-0029 128.030000 137.178875 and because as as you know where uh there's there's uh a ugly rumors on the horizon out there that we may be faced with that here in Texas 
sw2668A-ms98-a-0030 137.178875 138.210250 yeah
sw2668A-ms98-a-0031 138.210250 140.447250 [silence]
sw2668A-ms98-a-0032 140.447250 155.268000 uh i have no idea i- i i uh i'm i'm originally from Massachusetts but they didn't have a state income tax when i worked when i lived there so i have uh no and i know they have one now uh and i have no idea i have no idea what it is
sw2668A-ms98-a-0033 155.268000 169.498375 but you know getting back to the [vocalized-noise] getting back to the Federal income tax i remember during the Reagan administration i think it was the Tax Reform Act of nineteen eighty six or something like that when the taxes were reduced and it was made simpler and all that kind of stuff 
sw2668A-ms98-a-0034 169.498375 173.802375 uh i don't believe it it's worse [laughter] 
sw2668A-ms98-a-0035 173.802375 184.504500 oh sure and i seem to have more of that every year and uh yeah the only thing that's left deductible is uh is mortgage uh interest basically 
sw2668A-ms98-a-0036 184.504500 192.515250 and would then and and that's significant and every once in a while they make noises like they're going to take that out and that would just kill the housing industry if they did
sw2668A-ms98-a-0037 192.515250 194.723875 and and uh
sw2668A-ms98-a-0038 194.723875 203.763125 one other things that i only found out this year and uh uh i thought at one time i worked in in Malaysia for TI 
sw2668A-ms98-a-0039 203.763125 214.534250 and and had more money than i knew what to do with so i started making accelerated house payments and i said gee you know this would be great because i'll i'll have a lot of equity in my house
sw2668A-ms98-a-0040 214.534250 225.494750 then when my children are old enough to go to college i'll get a equity loan which will increase my mortgage so i'll be able to get money to send them to college and then get the mortgage interest deduction part
sw2668A-ms98-a-0041 225.494750 226.767875 guess what
sw2668A-ms98-a-0042 226.767875 232.212375 that that's not legal in Texas it's the only state in the country that it's not legal everybody else can do it but in Texas
sw2668A-ms98-a-0043 232.212375 239.005375 and and so i- i got this i got this three thousand foot five bedroom house that i've got almost paid off 
sw2668A-ms98-a-0044 239.005375 247.260500 and have all kinds of equity in it and don't have [laughter] and you know [laughter-struggling] to keep i've got two children in college and i'm going to have three by September [laughter]
sw2668A-ms98-a-0045 247.260500 253.414000 but but uh it it was just my fault not checking it up because i've heard of people doing it so i thought it was pretty good deal
sw2668A-ms98-a-0046 253.414000 262.483250 so but the uh uh i i it just seems to me that the that the income tax is getting a bigger and bigger hunk of us every year
sw2668A-ms98-a-0047 262.483250 277.175500 and and i'm not exactly sure wh[at]- what we get in return i was listening to a talk show i don't know we ever get any talk shows from Dallas up there but i listened to David Gold this afternoon on KLIF and he was saying that in nineteen fifty four
sw2668A-ms98-a-0048 277.175500 281.955750 Americans paid about one cent on the dollar in taxes
sw2668A-ms98-a-0049 281.955750 293.509375 and now we're paying something like a little over fifty fifty cents when you consider federal income tax FICA tax sales tax and all the other things we get hit with
sw2668A-ms98-a-0050 293.509375 297.643500 an[d]- it is it is absolutely incredible and
sw2668A-ms98-a-0051 297.643500 308.248375 and and the mentality that you cure ills by throwing money at it and you throw and you raise the money to throw at it by raising taxes is just absolutely terrible
sw2668A-ms98-a-0052 308.248375 310.939750 uh is you know do you have children in school
sw2668A-ms98-a-0053 310.939750 312.426750 [silence]
sw2668A-ms98-a-0054 312.426750 318.043625 oh you know you just got married okay well you one of the worst things in Tex[as]- how long you been in Texas
sw2668A-ms98-a-0055 318.043625 329.442750 oh okay well you'll find out one of these days because you probably came from a state that's got a very decent public school system and you'll find out that in Texas we've got uh i think we rank fiftieth out of fifty states
sw2668A-ms98-a-0056 329.442750 335.204500 and and the way they keep proposing fixing that is to raise [laughter-taxes] spend more [laughter-money]
sw2668A-ms98-a-0057 335.204500 341.797625 [silence]
sw2668A-ms98-a-0058 341.797625 355.792250 yeah well that plus that fact that you look into the we've got some very good private schools here and more and more people are sending their children private schools and what you look in the private schools is they've got a higher proportion of people on the payroll that are teaching
sw2668A-ms98-a-0059 355.792250 364.001250 than they do in the public schools and and my my son goes to a uh uh high school here in the Richardson school district which is one of the better ones in Texas 
sw2668A-ms98-a-0060 364.001250 370.050750 uh and and and uh however my goodness they got an assistant principal for everything
sw2668A-ms98-a-0061 370.050750 377.745250 and and and they've got uh i don't know what the ratio is but they've got a tremendously high ratio of administrative people to people that are actually out there teaching
sw2668A-ms98-a-0062 377.745250 380.199250 and it is sort of like we do at TI
sw2668A-ms98-a-0063 380.199250 395.007000 [laughter] yeah yeah we get we get fat in [laughter-those] [laughter-areas] and yeah and and and and we got they they got a lot of overhead in those schools and rather than throw more money at it they got to figure out how to get get the most out of the people that they got
sw2668A-ms98-a-0064 395.007000 397.631125 uh and and get them in the classroom plus
sw2668A-ms98-a-0065 397.631125 410.064500 uh i don't know it seems to me that that more so than when i went to school there are a lot of courses that aren't going allow f[irst]- first of all they're not college prep courses and i don't think they're going [vocalized-noise]
sw2668A-ms98-a-0066 410.064500 415.669750 help a person make a living they're just sort of things to get the kids their twenty one credits so they can graduate
sw2668A-ms98-a-0067 415.669750 429.839875 and [laughter] and and all that and uh so i'm i'm not i'm not overly pleased with that either but the uh uh the tax thing and i think our sales tax is uh uh somewhere around eight percent now isn't it 
sw2668A-ms98-a-0068 429.839875 430.940250 and
sw2668A-ms98-a-0069 430.940250 432.870375 [silence]
sw2668A-ms98-a-0070 432.870375 446.711500 yeah i i think right here in Dallas we're paying about eight percent and you know uh i say i was initially from Massachusetts i've been here thirty two years but they used to call it {Taxachusetts} and uh i was there on business this last weekend 
sw2668A-ms98-a-0071 446.711500 453.018875 and i i made a few purchases and i realized that as bad as their reputation is their sales tax only about five percent
sw2668A-ms98-a-0072 453.018875 464.507625 i know there were several things that i bought that were something in the order of a dollar and i noticed it was about five cents added onto it plus it doesn't cut it as early you know you buy a ten cent candy in seven eleven here and you pay eleven cents 
sw2668A-ms98-a-0073 464.507625 469.454000 fo[r]- it [laughter-and] and i notice theirs doesn't cut in much below fifty cents i think
sw2668A-ms98-a-0074 469.454000 473.199000 so so the little items you pay what the price tag says
sw2668A-ms98-a-0075 473.199000 480.150000 [silence]
sw2668A-ms98-a-0076 480.150000 489.622000 i don't know i- i don't i bet they're not i- i'll absolutely bet they're not it it's interesting i wish i knew this question was coming up because i've only heard of it in bits and pieces
sw2668A-ms98-a-0077 489.622000 500.603250 but apparently there was a bill before the federal legislature today to uh lower social security tax but the other end of it they were going to raise income taxes
sw2668A-ms98-a-0078 500.603250 501.622750 [silence]
sw2668A-ms98-a-0079 501.622750 514.297000 [laughter] [laughter-they] [laughter-were] [laughter-going] [laughter-to] they were going to give with one hand and take away with the other and i- i just heard bits and pieces on the radio today and i- i hadn't uh uh i haven't heard that i haven't heard that much about it
sw2668A-ms98-a-0080 514.297000 518.333500 uh what what kind of a sales tax was in In[diana]- Indiana
sw2668A-ms98-a-0081 518.333500 524.669500 uh-huh okay yeah did you go to school there in Indiana [vocalized-noise] Indiana University
