sw2653B-ms98-a-0081 345.658500 350.486250 i it's my responsibility to see that equipment is sent off to be calibrated
sw2653B-ms98-a-0082 350.486250 353.054000 uh see i'm with the QRA lab
sw2653B-ms98-a-0083 353.054000 362.197625 qualification and evaluation so naturally our equipment has to be in in top condition and is constantly calibrated and they're dated
sw2653B-ms98-a-0084 362.197625 368.130375 so i have to keep up with them_1 uh and it's very handy doing it on the computer
sw2653B-ms98-a-0085 368.130375 377.009500 i just run a printout every week and and it puts me right up-to-date what i'm what i have to do what i have to ship what i should be expecting to be returned

sw2653B-ms98-a-0087 380.080000 385.747500 and i must admit that up until i did start using one uh it was
sw2653B-ms98-a-0088 385.747500 388.628625 i had very little interest in computers
sw2653B-ms98-a-0089 388.628625 389.798000 [silence]
