sw2653A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.637250 [silence]
sw2653A-ms98-a-0002 0.637250 4.619375 so i own uh a PCAT at my home 
sw2653A-ms98-a-0003 4.619375 18.133125 [silence]
sw2653A-ms98-a-0004 18.133125 27.659375 well that's actually a good question my wife works out of the home uh our home she has an office and it si[ts]- actually sits in the office and she uses it to compose and print out letters
sw2653A-ms98-a-0005 27.659375 32.364000 [vocalized-noise] so that's a a very regular use of it that she has
sw2653A-ms98-a-0006 32.364000 36.747375 and then in addition to that i tinker around with it i'm a computer scientist
sw2653A-ms98-a-0007 36.747375 46.510500 and so i write programs to do little things i'm actually working on a data base at home just just to keep track of things nothing special and also
sw2653A-ms98-a-0008 46.510500 55.699000 i'm interested in writing some programs that will you know kind of like remind me of things uh like remind me that Wednesdays is trash day and the like
sw2653A-ms98-a-0009 55.699000 57.000750 although
sw2653A-ms98-a-0010 57.000750 66.326000 [silence]
sw2653A-ms98-a-0011 66.326000 67.363375 hum-um
sw2653A-ms98-a-0012 67.363375 69.410875 [silence]
sw2653A-ms98-a-0013 69.410875 71.483375 um-hum um-hum
sw2653A-ms98-a-0014 71.483375 76.312250 [silence]
sw2653A-ms98-a-0015 76.312250 86.621250 oh that's a key thing well actually there['s]- that's a there's really two issues to that that there's so many pa[ckages]- software packages available today that just require no programming
sw2653A-ms98-a-0016 86.621250 97.172875 so that y[ou]- you in other words when someone built that software package they had to use the programming but if they were careful they could uh make the use of it totally without understanding how the computer works
sw2653A-ms98-a-0017 97.172875 107.898375 but i think y[ou]- you you really hit the nail on the head for the average person is exactly what he can use it for and if your wife isn't working out of the home and sending out letters or if you don't
sw2653A-ms98-a-0018 107.898375 114.791375 want to build a data base to keep track of the nuts and bolts in your garage or whatever there your issue is then there really is
sw2653A-ms98-a-0019 114.791375 116.732500 [silence]
sw2653A-ms98-a-0020 116.732500 118.434375 oh i see wow
sw2653A-ms98-a-0021 118.434375 119.447625 [silence]
sw2653A-ms98-a-0022 119.447625 122.124875 i see well [laughter-congratulations] on [laughter-that]
sw2653A-ms98-a-0023 122.124875 123.585625 [silence]
sw2653A-ms98-a-0024 123.585625 130.103125 yeah well actually uh one other thing i might ought to mention is that they are actually getting quite cheap that
sw2653A-ms98-a-0025 130.103125 131.916625 [silence]
sw2653A-ms98-a-0026 131.916625 132.975500 um-hum
sw2653A-ms98-a-0027 132.975500 136.055125 [silence]
sw2653A-ms98-a-0028 136.055125 138.240000 right oh the calculators you mean
sw2653A-ms98-a-0029 138.240000 139.809125 yeah uh-huh
sw2653A-ms98-a-0030 139.809125 141.180500 yeah they sure do
sw2653A-ms98-a-0031 141.180500 155.148500 yeah i actually was thinking about upgrading mine very recently and kind of look at the whole spectrum you can actually buy a wh[ole]- a whole brand new computer with a not not a uh necessarily a slow one or or inadequate one but a pretty good one
sw2653A-ms98-a-0032 155.148500 157.281375 for six hundred dollars
sw2653A-ms98-a-0033 157.281375 159.601125 no hm th[at]-
sw2653A-ms98-a-0034 159.601125 166.516500 well a[ctually]- actually i wasn't including a printer but y[ou]- you can buy a printer now for a hundred dollars so make it seven hundred
sw2653A-ms98-a-0035 166.516500 167.694750 yeah
sw2653A-ms98-a-0036 167.694750 169.139250 [silence]
sw2653A-ms98-a-0037 169.139250 171.773625 yes uh-huh um-hum
sw2653A-ms98-a-0038 171.773625 176.161250 [silence]
sw2653A-ms98-a-0039 176.161250 188.815625 yeah the prices have plummeted you can buy the computer the guts just the guts with the power supply the box and the mother board of a a type of computer called an 8088 for about two hundred dollars
sw2653A-ms98-a-0040 188.815625 197.974875 and then the keyboard is another fifty the monitor with the card that drives it is another hundred and then the disk drive is two fifty and
sw2653A-ms98-a-0041 197.974875 199.801250 [silence]
sw2653A-ms98-a-0042 199.801250 211.389375 well that's the that's the deal is you're not buying brands now you're buying these knock offs so there's uh probably the way to do it if you really wanted to buy one there's there's a magazine called Computer Shopper
sw2653A-ms98-a-0043 211.389375 225.306500 it's a it's a big magazine i mean it's it's twelve inches acro[ss]- uh narrow the narrow side and and fif[teen]- fi[fteen]- seventeen inches the tall side and it's probably an inch thick a thousand pages but the book is the magazine is full
sw2653A-ms98-a-0044 225.306500 234.832000 of these mail order computer mail order houses and they're all competing with each so you just flip through there until you find a 8088 computer
sw2653A-ms98-a-0045 234.832000 241.543625 that['s]- that's called that's the original PC so it's be called a TI P[C]- i'm sorry an IBM PC compatible
sw2653A-ms98-a-0046 241.543625 250.456375 and you'll find all these things and you'll find the monitors for forty dollars and the card that drives the monitor that goes in the back of the b[oard]- board for twenty five dollars which is amazing to me
sw2653A-ms98-a-0047 250.456375 254.251750 and just you mix and match and then you do it by mail order
sw2653A-ms98-a-0048 254.251750 262.920750 but there's no real brands there's probably a half a dozen companies around the world that are making those mother boards the main computer the circuit board
sw2653A-ms98-a-0049 262.920750 264.875125 [silence]
sw2653A-ms98-a-0050 264.875125 269.152500 they're available in you know the B Daltons that that type of thing
sw2653A-ms98-a-0051 269.152500 275.849125 you'll notice it in that it's it's a it's a v[ery]- it's although it's a magazine it's large and like i said it's about an inch thick
sw2653A-ms98-a-0052 275.849125 283.495750 [silence]

sw2653A-ms98-a-0066 315.360875 324.240875 w[ell]- wh[at]- i did for years and then i was was a scientist over in central research labs and just recently i've changed my job to actually do some of the marketing
sw2653A-ms98-a-0067 324.240875 328.403000 so i now i i type that one but i don't use it anymore
sw2653A-ms98-a-0068 328.403000 329.548125 i don't
