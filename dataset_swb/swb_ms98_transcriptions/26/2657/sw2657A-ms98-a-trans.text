sw2657A-ms98-a-0002 0.336500 1.723250 huh okay
sw2657A-ms98-a-0003 1.723250 2.980250 [silence]
sw2657A-ms98-a-0004 2.980250 12.552875 well i don't know if i know anything or not but i've i've got some opinions on it see those type of people that that have the most opinions ones at don't know anything
sw2657A-ms98-a-0005 12.552875 13.698000 [laughter] 
sw2657A-ms98-a-0006 13.698000 27.487250 well uh i've had teenagers and i now have grandchildren that are teenagers and i don't know that it might do them a little bit of good to see the world from a different perspective
sw2657A-ms98-a-0007 27.487250 35.748875 uh i think this me generation has gone far too far and the young people are overly impressed
sw2657A-ms98-a-0008 35.748875 43.747875 and i think it wouldn't hurt them to step back from themselves just slightly and see things from a m[ore]- far more disadvantaged viewpoint
sw2657A-ms98-a-0009 43.747875 46.248375 [silence]
sw2657A-ms98-a-0010 46.248375 47.493250 uh
sw2657A-ms98-a-0011 47.493250 48.814000 [silence]
sw2657A-ms98-a-0012 48.814000 52.245875 i personally know nothing about the Peace Corps though
sw2657A-ms98-a-0013 52.245875 59.302250 [silence]
sw2657A-ms98-a-0014 59.302250 62.495250 but they have i read somewhere
sw2657A-ms98-a-0015 62.495250 63.322375 [silence]
sw2657A-ms98-a-0016 63.322375 69.998500 and i'm i'm out on a limb here some type of college uh
sw2657A-ms98-a-0017 69.998500 79.211875 volunteer work for teachers that they are straight out of college and they do one year of volunteer work teaching in the uh
sw2657A-ms98-a-0018 79.211875 83.717625 lower income brackets of the United States have you ever heard about that one
sw2657A-ms98-a-0019 83.717625 101.299125 [silence]
sw2657A-ms98-a-0020 101.299125 103.468000 oh really
sw2657A-ms98-a-0021 103.468000 114.470000 [silence]
sw2657A-ms98-a-0022 114.470000 118.995500 and this is money that she's borrowed t[o]- for her college education
sw2657A-ms98-a-0023 118.995500 120.271500 [silence]
sw2657A-ms98-a-0024 120.271500 122.267625 but she got credits for it
sw2657A-ms98-a-0025 122.267625 124.223875 that's very interesting
sw2657A-ms98-a-0026 124.223875 142.702000 [silence]
sw2657A-ms98-a-0027 142.702000 144.450000 hum
sw2657A-ms98-a-0028 144.450000 158.713750 [silence]
sw2657A-ms98-a-0029 158.713750 168.747375 yeah i think that is an excellent program i really do i like that and it's it's beneficial to the small towns too because they really really
sw2657A-ms98-a-0030 168.747375 174.701250 have have a disadvantage that we don't understand because we're in the Metroplex
sw2657A-ms98-a-0031 174.701250 176.991625 [silence]
sw2657A-ms98-a-0032 176.991625 187.299500 right you know if if we had some really major health problem that required a specialist we could find one it wouldn't be convenient
sw2657A-ms98-a-0033 187.299500 194.473375 but we could find one we wouldn't have to drive and spend the night someplace or something like that
sw2657A-ms98-a-0034 194.473375 197.987250 so i- i can see the advantage to that one
sw2657A-ms98-a-0035 197.987250 203.476250 the Peace Corps itself is really uh uh dying out isn't it
sw2657A-ms98-a-0036 203.476250 210.496250 [silence]
sw2657A-ms98-a-0037 210.496250 212.978750 it's still in existence
sw2657A-ms98-a-0038 212.978750 215.269875 [silence]
sw2657A-ms98-a-0039 215.269875 221.709250 i want to believe they go into other countries and teach them how to do things like farm
sw2657A-ms98-a-0040 221.709250 226.493125 uh dig their own wells set up their schools
sw2657A-ms98-a-0041 226.493125 227.759250 [silence]
sw2657A-ms98-a-0042 227.759250 229.984375 yes they it's not
sw2657A-ms98-a-0043 229.984375 235.966375 a program to teach them to use the American money it's a program to teach them to be more self-reliant
sw2657A-ms98-a-0044 235.966375 245.480500 and yes you're right i think it's a sixties program i think it was one of Kennedy's hot points that he that was his big deal
sw2657A-ms98-a-0045 245.480500 259.452125 [silence]
sw2657A-ms98-a-0046 259.452125 263.485875 right right um
sw2657A-ms98-a-0047 263.485875 265.324000 [silence]
sw2657A-ms98-a-0048 265.324000 267.993375 i think i- i- i i've
sw2657A-ms98-a-0049 267.993375 272.075250 singled out my grandchildren and but actually they're they're pretty good
sw2657A-ms98-a-0050 272.075250 283.295875 along those lines as compared to what i have seen from other people's children and grandchildren mine aren't really that bad but at the same time i think it would do them a world of good
sw2657A-ms98-a-0051 283.295875 285.474625 but there's a
sw2657A-ms98-a-0052 285.474625 287.752750 [silence]
sw2657A-ms98-a-0053 287.752750 291.984125 mandatory just like like the draft no
sw2657A-ms98-a-0054 291.984125 293.991875 [silence]
sw2657A-ms98-a-0055 293.991875 295.674750 every time you ha[ve]-
sw2657A-ms98-a-0056 295.674750 298.993125 [silence]
sw2657A-ms98-a-0057 298.993125 301.228500 they could buy their way out
sw2657A-ms98-a-0058 301.228500 303.495625 [silence]
sw2657A-ms98-a-0059 303.495625 309.273625 right you know they they'd figure a way around that one in a heartbeat but
sw2657A-ms98-a-0060 309.273625 311.604375 [silence]
sw2657A-ms98-a-0061 311.604375 318.302250 i'm wondering if there's another issue here and maybe this is why this has died out
sw2657A-ms98-a-0062 318.302250 327.763750 can you go into and this wasn't the question but it's it may be the more of the issue versus should young adults
sw2657A-ms98-a-0063 327.763750 331.303750 can they go in there and can anyone
sw2657A-ms98-a-0064 331.303750 333.976250 go into
sw2657A-ms98-a-0065 333.976250 342.486250 well out of the Kurdish community is a little bit of extreme at this time but say i think Bangladesh would have been a good example
sw2657A-ms98-a-0066 342.486250 349.709125 or some some really desperate situation and teach them_1 to farm and teach them_1 and doesn't do any good
sw2657A-ms98-a-0067 349.709125 351.995375 i don't know that it does
sw2657A-ms98-a-0068 351.995375 354.981375 i- i i don't know that um
sw2657A-ms98-a-0069 354.981375 359.497250 if you step back from the current issue and look at it
sw2657A-ms98-a-0070 359.497250 361.490500 more intellectually
sw2657A-ms98-a-0071 361.490500 368.519000 there are forever over as long as we know there are races of people that are dropping out
sw2657A-ms98-a-0072 368.519000 373.977500 you know we're losing certain races of people there are people now
sw2657A-ms98-a-0073 373.977500 381.967500 that are obsolete point and fact just just like endangered species of animals so there are quote tribes of people
sw2657A-ms98-a-0074 381.967500 385.327625 that are endangered or obsolete
sw2657A-ms98-a-0075 385.327625 396.269125 and i'm just wondering if you're fighting a natural process there of being winnowed out there's a German word for it that's elegant but i never can remember what it was uh
sw2657A-ms98-a-0076 396.269125 403.475750 but but they're they're being winnowed because they're where they are they're not adapted to their environment
sw2657A-ms98-a-0077 403.475750 405.309000 essentially
sw2657A-ms98-a-0078 405.309000 407.487750 um and
sw2657A-ms98-a-0079 407.487750 410.995125 uh one of the quick examples is the aborigines
sw2657A-ms98-a-0080 410.995125 412.045500 [silence]
sw2657A-ms98-a-0081 412.045500 415.181000 uh when we were in Australia
sw2657A-ms98-a-0082 415.181000 416.465000 [silence]
sw2657A-ms98-a-0083 416.465000 419.308750 uh sad little things
sw2657A-ms98-a-0084 419.308750 421.737625 uh i felt sorry for them_1
sw2657A-ms98-a-0085 421.737625 433.209000 because their society isn't there anymore and their belief system and a[ll]- all their structured of theirs all the structures of their society are gone
sw2657A-ms98-a-0086 433.209000 435.263750 essentially
sw2657A-ms98-a-0087 435.263750 437.360875 and they're just kind of
sw2657A-ms98-a-0088 437.360875 448.770875 more like a side show than anything else and that's sad but i don't think there's any way you could go uh the Peace Corps could go in and rescue those people and i th[at]- don't think you could have done it fifty or a hundred years ago either
sw2657A-ms98-a-0089 448.770875 452.773375 so i i'm wondering if the Peace Corps is really an effective tool
sw2657A-ms98-a-0090 452.773375 459.490375 [silence]
sw2657A-ms98-a-0091 459.490375 465.999750 good point we've got enough without lea[ve]- without a passport there's plenty
sw2657A-ms98-a-0092 465.999750 469.943250 yes i think we ought to worry about our own species
sw2657A-ms98-a-0093 469.943250 487.976500 [silence]
sw2657A-ms98-a-0094 487.976500 495.195375 i wonder now in and i've been out of school too long to answer this but i wonder if there aren't some sociology courses
sw2657A-ms98-a-0095 495.195375 516.276000 [silence]
sw2657A-ms98-a-0096 516.276000 519.179500 that's the last thing you want to do
sw2657A-ms98-a-0097 519.179500 535.696750 [silence]
sw2657A-ms98-a-0098 535.696750 537.756500 yeah that's exactly it
sw2657A-ms98-a-0099 537.756500 546.699000 they're not going to take that money you give them and go try to figure out a way to dry out with it now come [laughter-on] let's be realistic that's just not realistic
sw2657A-ms98-a-0100 546.699000 548.880500 [silence]
sw2657A-ms98-a-0101 548.880500 550.178625 right 
sw2657A-ms98-a-0102 550.178625 551.485750 [silence]
sw2657A-ms98-a-0103 551.485750 557.747000 no we're not i don't think i think that's more realistic than going making them_1 go in the Peace Corps
sw2657A-ms98-a-0104 557.747000 560.167875 i think that's a lot more realistic
sw2657A-ms98-a-0105 560.167875 561.987250 uh
sw2657A-ms98-a-0106 561.987250 570.503750 i i think that we should be spending more time and and again i don't think the the Peace Corps is is as successful now simply because
sw2657A-ms98-a-0107 570.503750 572.271750 it's not
sw2657A-ms98-a-0108 572.271750 575.260000 it doesn't fit the circumstance anymore
sw2657A-ms98-a-0109 575.260000 576.466250 [silence]
sw2657A-ms98-a-0110 576.466250 578.241000 uh we've got plenty
sw2657A-ms98-a-0111 578.241000 580.976625 in fact we've got far too many
sw2657A-ms98-a-0112 580.976625 584.240625 you're in uh what [vocalized-noise] Flower Mou[nd]-
sw2657A-ms98-a-0113 584.240625 593.973875 [silence]
sw2657A-ms98-a-0114 593.973875 599.953750 i was that's exactly what i was going to ask you have you ever have have you been downtown recent[ly]-
