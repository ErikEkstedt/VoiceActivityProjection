sw2657B-ms98-a-0015 83.010000 95.351375 no i haven't i know that uh my sister i have a twin sister and when she graduated she went to teach in a small town down in south Texas and i know that like if you have college notes if you teach in
sw2657B-ms98-a-0016 95.351375 102.035750 a lower income bracket where they don't pay as much and they cancel part of your you know your college note or whatever
sw2657B-ms98-a-0017 102.035750 103.496250 um-hum
sw2657B-ms98-a-0018 103.496250 115.260250 if it's like you know really a you know a lower paying job you know where in a small town you don't obviously you don't need as much as far as to you know to live
sw2657B-ms98-a-0019 115.260250 118.226000 [silence]
sw2657B-ms98-a-0020 118.226000 120.582625 yeah she only taught there one year but i

sw2657B-ms98-a-0024 123.995125 132.966375 and um i think it would be i know that also one of my cousins who uh he is in like the therapy type thing and and he was um
sw2657B-ms98-a-0025 132.966375 140.492625 some group paid part of his college income but then he was required to go back and work for a certain number of years in this town at uh
sw2657B-ms98-a-0026 140.492625 154.261250 uh i mean it's a nursing home or something like that so you know if if i think that that's a good way for people to you know maybe get people to come back to these small towns to work by helping
sw2657B-ms98-a-0027 154.261250 159.335250 people that normally might not be able to go to college and get the type of degree they want

sw2657B-ms98-a-0047 244.802625 247.205375 but it definitely would give
sw2657B-ms98-a-0048 247.205375 252.975000 a lot of the kids now that have everything given to them_1 that they want to see
sw2657B-ms98-a-0049 252.975000 260.225375 what it's like if you don't have all the money and can't have what you want when you want it

sw2657B-ms98-a-0054 283.740375 295.996375 i don't i don't know that you could require everyone to to do that for yeah to do it for a whole year or two years or something like that i don't know that that would work if if somebody's
sw2657B-ms98-a-0055 295.996375 298.927000 was didn't really want to be there and
sw2657B-ms98-a-0056 298.927000 305.900000 didn't have yeah i mean there'd be loopholes just like there is in anything [laughter-else]

sw2657B-ms98-a-0077 451.995000 461.487000 and here with the Peace Corps we're talking about all these people that aren't even in our own country when there's enough people here that i think probably need help and could be helped
sw2657B-ms98-a-0078 461.487000 464.990625 [silence]

sw2657B-ms98-a-0081 469.786875 483.253375 and maybe rather than just require somebody to join like the Peace Corps for a year maybe like um during college you know maybe have some kind of course where they'd be required to do some kind of community service type work and
sw2657B-ms98-a-0082 483.253375 487.691125 help people in that area or people in the United States

sw2657B-ms98-a-0084 494.208625 504.733625 there probably are you know for but i'm sure that's probably like people that do that are s[ocial]- are the people that are going to go into social work and stuff but i think that it wouldn't really be
sw2657B-ms98-a-0085 504.733625 510.676750 half bad for everybody not to do something you know and realize that it's everybody's responsibility
sw2657B-ms98-a-0086 510.676750 522.997500 to um help these people you know and no[t]- i'm not saying just give them_1 money but i mean because_1 they have to be taught to be yeah [laughter] i mean i know that's what my father-in-law was talking about you know when you give these people
sw2657B-ms98-a-0087 522.997500 524.700125 money or
sw2657B-ms98-a-0088 524.700125 530.642625 what was it they were bringing up points asking as far as whether they need to give um
sw2657B-ms98-a-0089 530.642625 538.494875 more money to these people i mean and that's not really the answer i mean because_1 if they're alcoholics they'll just go out and spend it on you know booze or something like that but

sw2657B-ms98-a-0092 545.497750 549.494000 or you know to find a job where they can learn how to support themselves i mean
sw2657B-ms98-a-0093 549.494000 554.487875 i guess we're getting kind of off the [laughter-subject] here but yeah i mean it's

sw2657B-ms98-a-0102 587.217250 594.828250 fa[rther]- you know farther removed from like Dallas and some of the areas where they probably have more of the homeless and that type of thing
