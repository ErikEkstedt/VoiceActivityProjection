sw2685B-ms98-a-0006 13.618625 27.283500 yeah i'm well i'm on i'm taking some vacation this week so it didn't bother me uh i'm a distance runner by hobby and uh i might say it was a little humid running out there tonight i was probably wetter than i have been in some time
sw2685B-ms98-a-0007 27.283500 34.845875 but uh for for a guy that likes to be outside as much as i do and run like i do this Texas is almost ideal
sw2685B-ms98-a-0008 34.845875 45.992875 because uh i would say probably i run three hundred days out of the three hundred and sixty five and there's probably not more than thirty of those days that i can't wear shorts and tee shirt
sw2685B-ms98-a-0009 45.992875 53.274375 i mean i have to wear long sleeves and maybe some long pants and that's fine with me if i can wear shorts and tee shirt i'm perfectly happy

sw2685B-ms98-a-0019 75.161125 82.080125 [laughter] well what what what we like to do is to get enough rain so not to have to water the lawn
sw2685B-ms98-a-0020 82.080125 93.852875 and it's been i've watered once in March and not any time in April because i figure we figure if we go five days without rain we need to water and just about every fifth day we're getting rain right now
sw2685B-ms98-a-0021 93.852875 99.336250 so everything is pretty and green here and we're not really uh and not having to pay money to water
sw2685B-ms98-a-0022 99.336250 113.840875 and uh of course of course summers summers uh i i guess uh once you get {climatized} and i am i mean i kind of look forward to the hundred degrees days ex[cept]- except for the air conditioning bills i i could i could do without the three hundred dollar electric bills

sw2685B-ms98-a-0046 210.421750 215.723250 but this year of course we got uh we had a very mild winter this year with very little freeze
sw2685B-ms98-a-0047 215.723250 225.426250 uh so we didn't have any problem uh uh with the uh uh with the grass greening up quickly you know last year it was well into May before all the bare spots got covered
sw2685B-ms98-a-0048 225.426250 232.280000 uh because of the of the severe winter that we had around Christmas of eighty nine but this year it uh
sw2685B-ms98-a-0049 232.280000 241.257125 we did have some cold days but not down in the single digits or anything like that so when things started greening up in March they greened up and everybody's grass is is
sw2685B-ms98-a-0050 241.257125 251.954500 is perfectly green do your homes you say you moved into a new home are homes norma[lly]- built there with central air conditioning is that part of the uh the standard for a home
sw2685B-ms98-a-0051 251.954500 262.915125 oh okay i i didn't know whether you were far enough south for that of course i'm i'm from New England my parents are there and it's it's unheard of there i guess anybody that wants air conditioning goes out and puts a window unit in [laughter]

sw2685B-ms98-a-0070 319.443250 329.270625 yeah yeah we we had zero snow here in fact we haven't had any measurable accumulation now in six or seven years uh
sw2685B-ms98-a-0071 329.270625 331.473250 [silence]
sw2685B-ms98-a-0072 331.473250 337.812750 yeah that was a nice one too that was an ice storm there and uh uh i remember one year
sw2685B-ms98-a-0073 337.812750 352.238750 i can't tell you the exact year it was probably about uh eighty seventy nine or eighty that we had such a severe ice storm that it uh knocked tree limbs down on the wires and there were some uh four hundred thousand homes out of electricity
sw2685B-ms98-a-0074 352.238750 363.686375 and i know it was after seventy eight because we built our home here in seventy eight and it was a new development that didn't have any trees yet so we had electricity and we had fifteen people camped out on our floor in sleeping bags
sw2685B-ms98-a-0075 363.686375 376.229125 and and unfortunately when it thawed then most everybody's houses got filled with water too [laughter] and uh but we we were fortunate that year and even at that this development was built in seventy eight and even now a[ll]- all the utilities run under ground
sw2685B-ms98-a-0076 376.229125 387.458625 so there's still no big trees in the development but the uh uh all all the utilities so we we wouldn't have to look forward to that but we had a uh we had a mild winter as i say the previous year
sw2685B-ms98-a-0077 387.458625 396.141125 we had three or four days uh i[t]- it wasn't much it was only about a week and i think it was the week just prior to Christmas when the temperature got down into the single digits
sw2685B-ms98-a-0078 396.141125 410.050250 and as a result a lot of the the trees and uh the grass and shrubbery was killed uh was killed out and at this time last year nothing looked very good but it it does right now uh at this time last year
sw2685B-ms98-a-0079 410.050250 422.682875 we were under water most of Texas was under water uh if you remember uh uh uh downtown Dallas you could go down and look up in the Reunion Tower and look over toward the Trinity River and it looked like lakes not a river
sw2685B-ms98-a-0080 422.682875 427.611250 and uh Lake Texoma was up uh twenty feet over flood level
sw2685B-ms98-a-0081 427.611250 441.436375 uh at at this time last year it was it was uh it was pretty bad but uh i'm i'm hoping you know you you don't want anything to flood but you want to get normal rain and uh we're probably some where near normal right now 
sw2685B-ms98-a-0082 441.436375 453.229000 [silence]

sw2685B-ms98-a-0098 494.992625 506.727250 uh in in Dallas it's across LBJ from the main TI site it's three glass buildings and that for someone that's been at TI thirty two years this is kind of {unTI} like too [laughter]

sw2685B-ms98-a-0102 520.234750 533.945750 yeah i'm in i'm in center one the big thing that i think other than the fact that we've all got double the size offices we've ever had anywhere else an[d]- it's so quiet that you can hear a pin drop to me the big advantage and i didn't realize it when we came over here is the covered parking
sw2685B-ms98-a-0103 533.945750 540.145625 it is amazing in the middle of the summer when it's a hundred and ten out to go out and be able to get into your car and touch the steering wheel
sw2685B-ms98-a-0104 540.145625 550.533625 which we could never do parked outside of the SC Building or the South Building or various other places that i've i worked and and you notice the finish on your car lasts longer when you wash it it stays clean longer
sw2685B-ms98-a-0105 550.533625 560.967250 uh it is is uh uh to me to me that's that's probably one of the biggest advantages that we've got over there plus i'm in center one and the credit union is down on the first floor
sw2685B-ms98-a-0106 560.967250 573.556250 and it seems that i'm alw[ays]- always there i've got a daughter away from coll[ege]- away at college that's always out of money so [laughter-it's] [laughter-easy] [laughter-i] [laughter-can] [laughter-get] [laughter-down] [laughter-to] [laughter-the] [laughter-credit] [laughter-union] quite often and uh are you looking forward to a hot summer there now
