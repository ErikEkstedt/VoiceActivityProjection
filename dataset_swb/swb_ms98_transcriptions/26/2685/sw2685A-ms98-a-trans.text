sw2685A-ms98-a-0022 113.258000 115.359250 yeah i remember those
sw2685A-ms98-a-0023 115.359250 119.872875 yeah well we've moved into a new house uh at the end of February
sw2685A-ms98-a-0024 119.872875 128.455750 and of course it's a new development and there's only one house in the whole thirty houses that are here that has grass
sw2685A-ms98-a-0025 128.455750 132.548875 so everything everything else is mud
sw2685A-ms98-a-0026 132.548875 133.749500 [silence]
sw2685A-ms98-a-0027 133.749500 143.331125 there's mud in the road there's mud on the sidewalk there's mud in the house i mean you just can't get away from it and of course it's been you know ideal weather for grass to grow
sw2685A-ms98-a-0028 143.331125 152.778500 and unfortunately they haven't gotten around to put they you know they were waiting until they got i think the other two houses on the cul-de-sac on one done before they're going to plant all the grass at one time
sw2685A-ms98-a-0029 152.778500 158.115625 [silence]

sw2685A-ms98-a-0032 161.055875 172.845250 you can put in any number of grasses up here uh a lot people like the red fescue they like to mix red fescue in with uh Kentucky Blue um the uh
sw2685A-ms98-a-0033 172.845250 180.511125 my favorite is uh a zoysia grass uh when i lived in Laura which is about sixty miles south of where i'm living now
sw2685A-ms98-a-0034 180.511125 195.285500 uh that my neighbor had it and i was forever trying to get you know decent grass to grow in my yard and he talked me into trying to some plugs of the zoysia and i just loved it because the zoysia you can uh you can quite literally just plug it around the yard
sw2685A-ms98-a-0035 195.285500 209.282125 and it just spreads and it chokes out the weeds and the weeds can't get in there and so you don't have to weed and feed and do all that other crazy stuff you just you know the only bad part about it is during the winter the grass is brown but i mean you know
sw2685A-ms98-a-0036 209.282125 210.905750 yeah
sw2685A-ms98-a-0037 210.905750 224.622000 [silence]

sw2685A-ms98-a-0044 279.638125 292.978250 you would go [vocalized-noise] from having fifty sixty degree days right into the eighty eighty five degree days which you know in Texas it's not bad because the humidity is real low but here when the temperature is eighty degrees the humidity is eighty
sw2685A-ms98-a-0045 292.978250 304.155250 and eighty per cent and and and worse i mean i've seen days here when the humidity is like ninety three a hundred per cent and it's just absolutely the worst feeling in the whole world
