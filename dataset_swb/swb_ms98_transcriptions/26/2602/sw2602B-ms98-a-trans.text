sw2602B-ms98-a-0003 2.094875 10.532875 okay do i still can['t]- still can feel that the Soviet Union as such is still a threat to the civilized western world absolutely
sw2602B-ms98-a-0004 10.532875 12.562625 [silence]
sw2602B-ms98-a-0005 12.562625 20.776500 and my reasons are based upon not only from what i read in the newspapers what i see on the newspapers but up against some of the
sw2602B-ms98-a-0006 20.776500 27.131875 fun and exciting things i ran into during my six years as a soldier in the Fifth Special Forces Group
sw2602B-ms98-a-0007 27.131875 37.744000 [silence]
sw2602B-ms98-a-0008 37.744000 40.440125 well that's what makes it a powder keg
sw2602B-ms98-a-0009 40.440125 42.254375 the um
sw2602B-ms98-a-0010 42.254375 43.826625 [silence]
sw2602B-ms98-a-0011 43.826625 47.526125 i'll go back in time a little bit to about eighty one
sw2602B-ms98-a-0012 47.526125 51.282375 when my first real involvement with the military started
sw2602B-ms98-a-0013 51.282375 52.735750 um
sw2602B-ms98-a-0014 52.735750 56.281750 [silence]
sw2602B-ms98-a-0015 56.281750 64.800750 naturally we were at the time the Soviet Union was considered to be the big military power and the big threat so we got lots quite a bit of
sw2602B-ms98-a-0016 64.800750 69.326750 information as well as indoctrination on Soviet tactics and weapons
sw2602B-ms98-a-0017 69.326750 70.376750 [silence]
sw2602B-ms98-a-0018 70.376750 76.047125 i went to Lebanon in eighty three before the marines ever got there with the UN Peace Keeping Force
sw2602B-ms98-a-0019 76.047125 78.782250 [silence]
sw2602B-ms98-a-0020 78.782250 84.920875 and with the training i received prior to going there with captured weapons we kept running up against
sw2602B-ms98-a-0021 84.920875 92.451375 these weren't these weren't Chinese made copies these were Soviet made top of the line fresh out of the box AK-47s
sw2602B-ms98-a-0022 92.451375 95.922875 as well as a lot of the explosives we were running into
sw2602B-ms98-a-0023 95.922875 97.527375 [silence]
sw2602B-ms98-a-0024 97.527375 102.230375 in Granada in October twenty fifth eighty three we invaded the place
sw2602B-ms98-a-0025 102.230375 107.617250 sure there were Cuban soldiers there but there was also a bunch of Russian advisors that were damn good shots
sw2602B-ms98-a-0026 107.617250 108.769000 [silence]
sw2602B-ms98-a-0027 108.769000 114.068375 the team i was with we jumped in on the western tip of of the island down on Point Salinas
sw2602B-ms98-a-0028 114.068375 115.640125 [silence]
sw2602B-ms98-a-0029 115.640125 120.230625 and for every Cuban there was at least five Russian advisors
sw2602B-ms98-a-0030 120.230625 124.689250 and they were all shooting state of the art Soviet weapons
sw2602B-ms98-a-0031 124.689250 126.482375 [silence]
sw2602B-ms98-a-0032 126.482375 128.316500 in eighty four
sw2602B-ms98-a-0033 128.316500 132.531250 i was down in Central America as an advisor to the Honduran army
sw2602B-ms98-a-0034 132.531250 138.056250 again we were running up against Cubans quite a bit plus Soviet advisors
sw2602B-ms98-a-0035 138.056250 145.767500 and the equipment we were capturing and taking from the Nicaraguans was brand new out of the crate Soviet made material
sw2602B-ms98-a-0036 145.767500 148.774375 do i consider them a threat absolutely
sw2602B-ms98-a-0037 148.774375 153.128750 they have a university in Moscow called the Patrice de Lamumba University
sw2602B-ms98-a-0038 153.128750 154.131375 [silence]
sw2602B-ms98-a-0039 154.131375 158.783750 about like A and M or UT where they're teachings subjects like that they're teaching terrorism
sw2602B-ms98-a-0040 158.783750 159.853500 [silence]
sw2602B-ms98-a-0041 159.853500 166.455500 some of the people we went up against in Lebanon were graduates from that place and let me tell you they are nothing nice to go up against
sw2602B-ms98-a-0042 166.455500 170.616125 i'm surprised during this Iraqi crisis we didn't have more
sw2602B-ms98-a-0043 170.616125 173.378625 incidents than they did
sw2602B-ms98-a-0044 173.378625 176.277625 these guys are top of the line
sw2602B-ms98-a-0045 176.277625 178.930500 when they when they graduate from there
sw2602B-ms98-a-0046 178.930500 182.995250 they can pull terrorist actions anywhere in the free world
sw2602B-ms98-a-0047 182.995250 184.855625 [silence]
sw2602B-ms98-a-0048 184.855625 187.505875 and they are very very good at what they do
sw2602B-ms98-a-0049 187.505875 190.699500 [silence]
sw2602B-ms98-a-0050 190.699500 193.777000 so until i see the entire
sw2602B-ms98-a-0051 193.777000 196.596875 quote old guard
sw2602B-ms98-a-0052 196.596875 201.914250 of the Soviet military of the Soviet government
sw2602B-ms98-a-0053 201.914250 202.924875 [silence]
sw2602B-ms98-a-0054 202.924875 207.370000 completely roll over and disappear preferably buried
sw2602B-ms98-a-0055 207.370000 209.755375 i still consider them a threat
sw2602B-ms98-a-0056 209.755375 211.461250 [silence]
sw2602B-ms98-a-0057 211.461250 218.298375 their military is different from ours to where there are extremist gen[erals]- generals that actually control tens and thousands
sw2602B-ms98-a-0058 218.298375 219.961875 of troops
sw2602B-ms98-a-0059 219.961875 224.674000 that irregardless of what Soviet policy is they're going to do what the general tells them
sw2602B-ms98-a-0060 224.674000 236.229875 [silence]
sw2602B-ms98-a-0061 236.229875 242.928000 well it's in[teresting]- interesting watching the different Soviet states Albania Lithuania
sw2602B-ms98-a-0062 242.928000 246.384375 doing their little revolts down there
sw2602B-ms98-a-0063 246.384375 250.799000 each one of those sectors has got a Soviet general over the troops that are there
sw2602B-ms98-a-0064 250.799000 254.478000 so far they hadn't run into the real psychos yet 
sw2602B-ms98-a-0065 254.478000 262.986000 there's probably five or six which would be an equivalent of our joint chiefs of staffs that are in positions over some of these Soviet states
sw2602B-ms98-a-0066 262.986000 266.391375 if uprisings ha[ppen]- happen in their sectors
sw2602B-ms98-a-0067 266.391375 267.490875 [silence]
sw2602B-ms98-a-0068 267.490875 270.410000 it is it's going to be a total blood bath
sw2602B-ms98-a-0069 270.410000 274.534625 [silence]
sw2602B-ms98-a-0070 274.534625 277.964500 actually they're showing remarkable restraint
sw2602B-ms98-a-0071 277.964500 279.847750 [silence]
sw2602B-ms98-a-0072 279.847750 284.071000 they get real nasty the Hyundee helicopters come out and they
sw2602B-ms98-a-0073 284.071000 286.651750 would level entire areas
sw2602B-ms98-a-0074 286.651750 287.961750 [silence]
sw2602B-ms98-a-0075 287.961750 290.552500 okay you're from the Dallas area right
sw2602B-ms98-a-0076 290.552500 295.723250 okay you know basically the size of uh the area around Richardson
sw2602B-ms98-a-0077 295.723250 296.724250 [silence]
sw2602B-ms98-a-0078 296.724250 303.195500 you put five Soviet Hyundee helicopters in the air they can level the entire area and there won't be anything left alive
sw2602B-ms98-a-0079 303.195500 306.149250 and they can do that in about four minutes
sw2602B-ms98-a-0080 306.149250 307.456000 [silence]
sw2602B-ms98-a-0081 307.456000 310.852625 and they've got entire squadrons of those just standing by
sw2602B-ms98-a-0082 310.852625 313.506125 [silence]
sw2602B-ms98-a-0083 313.506125 319.597375 they used them in Afghanistan did re[markably]- remarkably well considering the terrain they were flying in
sw2602B-ms98-a-0084 319.597375 323.613875 [silence]
sw2602B-ms98-a-0085 323.613875 328.451500 but on a highly populated area like some of the Soviet cities would be
sw2602B-ms98-a-0086 328.451500 332.312500 [silence]
sw2602B-ms98-a-0087 332.312500 337.254750 with the weaponry that's attached on those things there is no place to hide
sw2602B-ms98-a-0088 337.254750 343.617250 if the bombs don't get you if the bullets don't get you then the then the nerve gas definitely will get you
sw2602B-ms98-a-0089 343.617250 346.474125 [silence]
sw2602B-ms98-a-0090 346.474125 351.163000 the only drawback on that little piece of machinery is they only got five minutes of air time
sw2602B-ms98-a-0091 351.163000 352.294125 [silence]
sw2602B-ms98-a-0092 352.294125 354.335750 they drink that much fuel
sw2602B-ms98-a-0093 354.335750 360.632625 [silence]
sw2602B-ms98-a-0094 360.632625 364.767750 were you have you i take it you haven't spent any time in the military
sw2602B-ms98-a-0095 364.767750 365.835250 [silence]
sw2602B-ms98-a-0096 365.835250 371.565375 as a civilian that's never been attached to any form of the military
sw2602B-ms98-a-0097 371.565375 372.616375 [silence]
sw2602B-ms98-a-0098 372.616375 378.829125 i know a lot of this stuff that i was involved in never did make the newspapers but
sw2602B-ms98-a-0099 378.829125 380.036750 [silence]
sw2602B-ms98-a-0100 380.036750 385.069500 during that same time frame didn't you get some feeling that i mean they're getting all these weapons and stuff
sw2602B-ms98-a-0101 385.069500 386.179750 didn't it
sw2602B-ms98-a-0102 386.179750 389.925250 it bug you a little bit why they kept coming up with all this stuff
sw2602B-ms98-a-0103 389.925250 396.406625 [silence]
sw2602B-ms98-a-0104 396.406625 398.993875 in any of them since eighty one
sw2602B-ms98-a-0105 398.993875 421.308875 [silence]
sw2602B-ms98-a-0106 421.308875 427.752125 it all boils down to whether it's our side their side it's a matter of money to a certain extent
sw2602B-ms98-a-0107 427.752125 431.111000 the deal the Iraqi's have with the Russians was for oil
sw2602B-ms98-a-0108 431.111000 441.170625 [silence]
sw2602B-ms98-a-0109 441.170625 445.348250 uh the ones to the south are more regional conflict
sw2602B-ms98-a-0110 445.348250 449.476000 they're not really that worried about
sw2602B-ms98-a-0111 449.476000 452.364125 invading north
sw2602B-ms98-a-0112 452.364125 457.298375 they're more interested in they've got a screwed up situation i'll give them that
sw2602B-ms98-a-0113 457.298375 458.902125 [silence]
sw2602B-ms98-a-0114 458.902125 465.954750 from Mexico all the way down into Cen[tral]- Central and South America the situation down there is weird and it's very screwed up
sw2602B-ms98-a-0115 465.954750 470.732875 inflation is out of this world and the governments which
sw2602B-ms98-a-0116 470.732875 477.074625 our government has technically supported for years are corrupt as all get out
sw2602B-ms98-a-0117 477.074625 484.000625 and generally the people are getting screwed and they're tired of it and they're willing to try anything to get out from under it even if that means going to communism
sw2602B-ms98-a-0118 484.000625 499.675875 [silence]
sw2602B-ms98-a-0119 499.675875 503.744625 unfortunately Yeltsin's got too many connections with the old guard
sw2602B-ms98-a-0120 503.744625 506.774500 [silence]
sw2602B-ms98-a-0121 506.774500 516.209750 that's the only drawback that i see with the entire thing Gorbachev has made his attempt and he's had his problems with some of the old guard himself
sw2602B-ms98-a-0122 516.209750 519.063625 Yeltsin's in tight with the old guard
sw2602B-ms98-a-0123 519.063625 521.951250 [silence]
sw2602B-ms98-a-0124 521.951250 526.124875 so it may be trying to choose between the lesser of two evils at this point
sw2602B-ms98-a-0125 526.124875 539.661625 [silence]
sw2602B-ms98-a-0126 539.661625 543.574500 you mean i understand when they pulled the troops out of uh
sw2602B-ms98-a-0127 543.574500 549.293625 or they reduced the number of troops in Europe after the Berlin Wall went down i thought that was great
sw2602B-ms98-a-0128 549.293625 551.550875 [silence]
sw2602B-ms98-a-0129 551.550875 553.885875 but by no means do i
sw2602B-ms98-a-0130 553.885875 557.123750 endorse or approve pulling everybody out
sw2602B-ms98-a-0131 557.123750 558.656500 [silence]
sw2602B-ms98-a-0132 558.656500 560.826125 it may be
sw2602B-ms98-a-0133 560.826125 564.553375 a much reduced force than what we used to have over there
sw2602B-ms98-a-0134 564.553375 566.214375 [silence]
sw2602B-ms98-a-0135 566.214375 572.841500 but you still better have the key players in place if something does go down even if it's a regional conflict
sw2602B-ms98-a-0136 572.841500 577.140250 [silence]
sw2602B-ms98-a-0137 577.140250 578.351625 if
sw2602B-ms98-a-0138 578.351625 582.582375 United States is going to flex its muscle and be the super power that it is
sw2602B-ms98-a-0139 582.582375 590.257250 not only does it it can talk the talk but it's got to be able to walk the walk it's got to have the stuff to back it back up what it's saying
sw2602B-ms98-a-0140 590.257250 595.401875 if you've only got a token force there you can't hold your ground
