sw2626B-ms98-a-0066 317.563750 318.644250 [silence]
sw2626B-ms98-a-0067 318.644250 325.558000 and of course they're not going to tell the other side of the story and they're not going to tell it accurately

sw2626B-ms98-a-0075 363.188500 368.779125 and it seemed as though during the Gulf Crisis it might have been [vocalized-noise] under pressure from 
sw2626B-ms98-a-0076 368.779125 370.249750 [silence]
sw2626B-ms98-a-0077 370.249750 372.527625 the incorrect side
sw2626B-ms98-a-0078 372.527625 374.063750 [silence]
sw2626B-ms98-a-0079 374.063750 376.868500 i i'm not sure how to phrase that

sw2626B-ms98-a-0085 403.318000 405.760875 i kept watching that
sw2626B-ms98-a-0086 405.760875 415.116125 be it CNN in a bar or or or or local news at home or federal news at home or or see uh
sw2626B-ms98-a-0087 415.116125 421.031750 we don't subscribe to our Colorado Springs paper we [vocalized-noise] subscribe to the Denver paper 
sw2626B-ms98-a-0088 421.031750 428.142125 and uh but on occasion more than occasionally we'll buy the local paper
sw2626B-ms98-a-0089 428.142125 429.821375 and
sw2626B-ms98-a-0090 429.821375 430.916750 [silence]
sw2626B-ms98-a-0091 430.916750 439.010500 that warm fuzzy that we're talking about i never could get that warm fuzzy feeling in the pit of my stomach about
sw2626B-ms98-a-0092 439.010500 444.573750 are these people really telling me the truth or more importantly all the truth
sw2626B-ms98-a-0093 444.573750 452.994750 [silence]
sw2626B-ms98-a-0094 452.994750 459.089750 well i'd suspect that to be true but you couldn't prove it to me
sw2626B-ms98-a-0095 459.089750 460.075000 [silence]
sw2626B-ms98-a-0096 460.075000 462.420500 and and
sw2626B-ms98-a-0097 462.420500 465.719875 most importantly i
sw2626B-ms98-a-0098 465.719875 467.695125 [silence]
sw2626B-ms98-a-0099 467.695125 470.140375 couldn't believe any of those people
sw2626B-ms98-a-0100 470.140375 472.056500 they didn't
sw2626B-ms98-a-0101 472.056500 474.235500 seem believable
sw2626B-ms98-a-0102 474.235500 476.094625 [silence]
sw2626B-ms98-a-0103 476.094625 486.632750 oh all four um well we have the independent here and we've got the three majors and PBS and we watched
sw2626B-ms98-a-0104 486.632750 494.235125 all four of those and on more than occasionally i went to a bar that had CNN running around the clock
sw2626B-ms98-a-0105 494.235125 497.030375 and
sw2626B-ms98-a-0106 497.030375 501.353000 still i got this feeling as though
sw2626B-ms98-a-0107 501.353000 509.594625 from these six or eight news sources i had that something was missing
sw2626B-ms98-a-0108 509.594625 516.229375 [silence]
sw2626B-ms98-a-0109 516.229375 517.054375 and

sw2626B-ms98-a-0115 544.388125 547.892000 but i had the feeling
sw2626B-ms98-a-0116 547.892000 549.133750 [silence]
sw2626B-ms98-a-0117 549.133750 557.771375 that no matter who i listened to it wasn't that they weren't telling me the truth i felt that someone was lying to me
sw2626B-ms98-a-0118 557.771375 559.677000 and
sw2626B-ms98-a-0119 559.677000 567.548500 there's nothing there still at this state that i can put my finger on and say oh here's where they lied to me
sw2626B-ms98-a-0120 567.548500 568.666500 [silence]
sw2626B-ms98-a-0121 568.666500 570.327250 just a feeling
sw2626B-ms98-a-0122 570.327250 573.470125 [silence]
sw2626B-ms98-a-0123 573.470125 578.704250 yes [laughter] wouldn't it be wonderful if there were no more wars

sw2626B-ms98-a-0125 587.038875 589.005000 and more importantly
sw2626B-ms98-a-0126 589.005000 593.800875 wouldn't it be nice in this land of the free and home of the brave
sw2626B-ms98-a-0127 593.800875 598.596625 if there were never again be any misinformation
