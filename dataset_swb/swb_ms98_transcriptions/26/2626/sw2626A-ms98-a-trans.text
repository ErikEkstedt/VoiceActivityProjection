sw2626A-ms98-a-0015 51.829000 64.460625 oh i think uh during the Middle East Crisis there was a problem in terms of too quick to try to get a scoop and not checking facts out and i think that's probably a a good relevant 
sw2626A-ms98-a-0016 64.460625 73.810375 uh fear of all of it yeah i didn't see a movie a long time ago but it was about the news team that um
sw2626A-ms98-a-0017 73.810375 86.593875 tried to influence the world and i i have a feeling that they're much more into themselves sometimes than they are into what the world um is ready to hear they create news
sw2626A-ms98-a-0018 86.593875 90.594000 [silence]

sw2626A-ms98-a-0022 110.266625 123.301250 and i had already seen on the news about an hour before that that accident victim had died but the radio news report was that he was still in intensive care so it's one of those um
sw2626A-ms98-a-0023 123.301250 129.608625 it the most immediate is TV The others are catch up and fill in
sw2626A-ms98-a-0024 129.608625 137.805750 [silence]

sw2626A-ms98-a-0034 175.668375 187.602375 uh i think about other topics too i i'd like to go to a city and sort of look at the front page and find out what is going on in that city but it's always the national information that you have to flip through to find out
sw2626A-ms98-a-0035 187.602375 191.114500 anything special about the city and i think that's uh
sw2626A-ms98-a-0036 191.114500 192.873875 [silence]

sw2626A-ms98-a-0053 295.433250 307.462500 i wonder sometimes where they get those topics you know the some of the topics are very very good and others are like uh who who who dreamed this subject up you know [vocalized-noise] 
sw2626A-ms98-a-0054 307.462500 311.922500 and as far as affecting a national audience i wonder sometimes

sw2626A-ms98-a-0061 337.943875 343.006125 okay it's it's a good addition because i think they're
sw2626A-ms98-a-0062 343.006125 349.464625 they have a lot of news obviously all the time and there's not the pressure then

sw2626A-ms98-a-0074 382.309375 392.002250 it's been it's been a big factor for many many years but this is the first uh first time we have seen it so quickly and so close up
sw2626A-ms98-a-0075 392.002250 393.187500 it

sw2626A-ms98-a-0085 443.246250 454.759875 yeah i think all the truth is is the big issue they obviously had to be telling a lot of truth because they were there reporting firsthand but in terms of
sw2626A-ms98-a-0086 454.759875 457.754375 [silence]

sw2626A-ms98-a-0093 510.193000 523.090500 uh i think they they withhold when it's advantageous both sides both sides and i think when uh Norman announced afterwards on the Barbara Walters Show 
sw2626A-ms98-a-0094 523.090500 531.539750 yes that um he knew you know what to expect out of S[addam]- Saddam Hussein

sw2626A-ms98-a-0102 575.937625 585.690000 [noise] oh that would be nice i hope we never never get to but i'm afraid um human nature is such that somewhere there'll be a fanatic that will start something
