sw2640A-ms98-a-0002 4.960000 19.588500 i had never really thought of what they said before about allowing the the sentencing to uh to go to the judge instead of the jury and allowing him to do that i've been kind of sitting here thinking about that a little bit while we was waiting for them_1 to find somebody and [noise] i don't know that that's not a good idea
sw2640A-ms98-a-0003 19.588500 28.526375 [silence]
sw2640A-ms98-a-0004 28.526375 30.110500 i agree

sw2640A-ms98-a-0009 43.267125 48.377625 [silence]
sw2640A-ms98-a-0010 48.377625 54.071625 i don't like that no i don't like that at all i know my husband served on a on a jury
sw2640A-ms98-a-0011 54.071625 66.550125 a few months ago up here in Denton that uh was a guy it was uh it was a drug conviction and i don't remember he had some cocaine and i[t]- it was accused of selling it and i don't remember exactly how much he had but uh actually not selling it there's a differ[ence]- cour[iering]- 
sw2640A-ms98-a-0012 66.550125 73.992375 couriering it is what a[nd]- and there's supposedly a difference from selling then being a courier if he was a courier [noise] and um
sw2640A-ms98-a-0013 73.992375 79.797500 [noise] th[ey]- they he he sat on that jury and they found him guilty and they went through the sentencing phase and everything [noise] 
sw2640A-ms98-a-0014 79.797500 93.999625 and uh you know they were told that you know during the trial that this is this guy's first offense and he's got this clean record and and they ended up the jury you know decided hey it's time to crackdown here you know and it's time to to do this drug thing and let's crackdown and let's really and they sentenced
sw2640A-ms98-a-0015 93.999625 107.523625 him to fifteen years you know which they thought first offense okay this is they thought that that was uh that was a good thing [noise] and they sentenced him to fifteen years and um after it was all over uh the ju[dge]- they sit down with the judge and with the other two lawyers 
sw2640A-ms98-a-0016 107.523625 109.995500 <b_aside> let me come over in just a second okay <e_aside>
sw2640A-ms98-a-0017 109.995500 116.234375 and sat down with the judge and with the other two lawyers and they were told that uh he would probably serve three
sw2640A-ms98-a-0018 116.234375 122.357250 of the fifteen [noise] and that he had three previous convictions
sw2640A-ms98-a-0019 122.357250 128.588250 however they could not tell the ju[dge]- the jury that during the trial because all three of them were in appeal
sw2640A-ms98-a-0020 128.588250 132.345750 so the jury didn't know about it so here they based their sentencing
sw2640A-ms98-a-0021 132.345750 138.372250 thinking that this was this guy's first offense and so you know we'll give him fifteen which'll teach him a lesson but it's not just
sw2640A-ms98-a-0022 138.372250 149.971375 [noise] you know horrible since it was first offense and he'd been convicted three times before you know and and the jury was very upset and my husband came home at home very upset i mean he felt like that that they had been tricked you know and so
sw2640A-ms98-a-0023 149.971375 154.805125 something i wonder if a judge didn't have control of that if some of that would change you know
sw2640A-ms98-a-0024 154.805125 158.817500 [silence]
sw2640A-ms98-a-0025 158.817500 163.446625 that's true that's very true yeah [noise]
sw2640A-ms98-a-0026 163.446625 168.078750 yeah obviously what we're doing is not working you know no
sw2640A-ms98-a-0027 168.078750 169.217375 [silence]
sw2640A-ms98-a-0028 169.217375 180.897625 yeah and there's you know there's people in our prisons that are not being rehabilitated in any way shape or form and either they're in there forever or when they get out they're you know it's a matter of a few months and they're gonna be right back for the same thing so the syst[em]-
sw2640A-ms98-a-0029 180.897625 184.955125 [silence]

sw2640A-ms98-a-0031 194.736000 198.858875 to and and th[e]- and the people in those countries rely on our money to survive [noise] 
sw2640A-ms98-a-0032 198.858875 212.139125 but i really believe that we need to take care of ourselves i mean we and and it w[ould]- i know people say oh it would be cruel to you know pull our aid from these other countries and and maybe so so tell them you've got five years
sw2640A-ms98-a-0033 212.139125 214.847375 to work out a plan to make it on your own
sw2640A-ms98-a-0034 214.847375 224.888875 and we will continue funding you for the next two years after two years we're cut it down seven[ty]- to seventy fi[ve]- you know seventy five percent [noise] and after another year we'll cut it fifty percent and in five years
sw2640A-ms98-a-0035 224.888875 229.406500 it sh[ould]- by then you should all should have a plan worked where you can make it on your own without our help
sw2640A-ms98-a-0036 229.406500 233.671250 and then we'll have all we'll ha[ve]- we will have the money if we would do that
sw2640A-ms98-a-0037 233.671250 239.620125 to to work on our own system because we've got some serious problems here and we're trying to heal the world [laughter-you] know it's just not
sw2640A-ms98-a-0038 239.620125 241.281750 it's just not working
sw2640A-ms98-a-0039 241.281750 250.568000 [noise] i look at the i look at what you know this what were the aid we're sending to the Kurds and i- i feel sorry for them_1 and i know they're suffering and i know they're dying every day but we've got 
sw2640A-ms98-a-0040 250.568000 255.671375 you know kids here in the United States that are dying every day too you know and being
sw2640A-ms98-a-0041 255.671375 259.606750 abused and neglected and you know i don't know i just have this problem with
sw2640A-ms98-a-0042 259.606750 263.460750 [vocalized-noise] trying to heal the world when you're so sick yourself you know so

sw2640A-ms98-a-0046 269.724000 274.804250 i think we should try it like you say if it doesn't work we can always come back but i think it would be a good idea to try it
