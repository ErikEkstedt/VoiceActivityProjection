sw2613A-ms98-a-0004 8.176125 11.096625 um for the worst i would assume

sw2613A-ms98-a-0010 35.229875 39.797250 you're probably lucky to see the end of the runway by [laughter-now] [laughter]

sw2613A-ms98-a-0014 52.157875 62.148250 well i'll tell you i don't know i i don't know whether i i i count the stink as part of air pollution and it stinks down here

sw2613A-ms98-a-0018 71.337500 74.563375 it depends on where you are now if you're over
sw2613A-ms98-a-0019 74.563375 75.574500 [silence]
sw2613A-ms98-a-0020 75.574500 82.820250 yeah if you if you're over by Asheville you're you're pretty good because you're up there in the mountains and you've got some nice ozone and all that 
sw2613A-ms98-a-0021 82.820250 88.132750 over here in Raleigh it's kind of flat and stagnant and
sw2613A-ms98-a-0022 88.132750 90.118125 just yucky
sw2613A-ms98-a-0023 90.118125 95.916000 it's fine over on the coast because you've got the you've got the breezes off the off the water there
sw2613A-ms98-a-0024 95.916000 100.883125 but uh seems like it's just dull and uninspiring here
sw2613A-ms98-a-0025 100.883125 108.262750 [silence]
sw2613A-ms98-a-0026 108.262750 113.527250 no i don't know they're they keep doing things and it doesn't seem to be doing any good
sw2613A-ms98-a-0027 113.527250 120.828125 i was i was really amazed because i never would have expected you know this problem somewhere like in Atlanta
sw2613A-ms98-a-0028 120.828125 128.421625 and i drove through Atlanta uh couple of weeks ago and it was unseasonably warm
sw2613A-ms98-a-0029 128.421625 133.971125 and you could see the smog just sitting on top of the city
sw2613A-ms98-a-0030 133.971125 140.588625 and when i drove through i was it was terrible i had to keep the windows up 
sw2613A-ms98-a-0031 140.588625 143.722125 it was just so thick and uh
sw2613A-ms98-a-0032 143.722125 145.021250 heavy
sw2613A-ms98-a-0033 145.021250 156.615625 uh i couldn't believe it i because i me[an]- i used to live in Atlanta years ago and it was always fairly clean i mean you you always you didn't have problem with stagnant air like like LA does
sw2613A-ms98-a-0034 156.615625 159.717625 but boy it was really bad that day
sw2613A-ms98-a-0035 159.717625 161.123125 and it
sw2613A-ms98-a-0036 161.123125 166.427875 [silence]
sw2613A-ms98-a-0037 166.427875 167.693125 yeah
sw2613A-ms98-a-0038 167.693125 173.027500 [silence]
sw2613A-ms98-a-0039 173.027500 174.998625 yeah right
sw2613A-ms98-a-0040 174.998625 180.921625 [silence]
sw2613A-ms98-a-0041 180.921625 185.146250 but you see all these all these trucks belching out this black smoke
sw2613A-ms98-a-0042 185.146250 186.816750 [silence]
sw2613A-ms98-a-0043 186.816750 189.310750 yeah i know it's
sw2613A-ms98-a-0044 189.310750 198.305750 i i i i don't understand where the priority is it's uh like in Atlanta they have um they have mandatory catalytic converter inspections 
sw2613A-ms98-a-0045 198.305750 201.858750 there's only three places in Georgia that requires that
sw2613A-ms98-a-0046 201.858750 205.757250 and uh even with that it hasn't done any good
sw2613A-ms98-a-0047 205.757250 208.324500 i mean obviously it's gotten a lot worse
sw2613A-ms98-a-0048 208.324500 219.012250 but you know just like you say you go through there and you watch all these trucks and they're just coughing out all kinds of stuff some of them spitting it out so thick you can't even see past it
sw2613A-ms98-a-0049 219.012250 221.001500 you know i don't know
sw2613A-ms98-a-0050 221.001500 229.618375 [silence]
sw2613A-ms98-a-0051 229.618375 233.059375 uh-huh yeah because of the stuff settles on it
sw2613A-ms98-a-0052 233.059375 235.311500 [silence]
sw2613A-ms98-a-0053 235.311500 237.041625 yeah
sw2613A-ms98-a-0054 237.041625 238.763375 yeah
sw2613A-ms98-a-0055 238.763375 239.228500 [noise]
sw2613A-ms98-a-0056 239.228500 246.131125 i don't know things like you know well like acid rain and all these sulphur dioxides being dumped out there
sw2613A-ms98-a-0057 246.131125 250.242000 i i'm more worried about that than i am just about anything else
sw2613A-ms98-a-0058 250.242000 251.825500 because uh
sw2613A-ms98-a-0059 251.825500 262.316625 uh it's it's all i mean it's just li[ke]- it's just like a big avalanche you know you start putting sulphur dioxide in the atmosphere and you end up with acid rain acid rain kills trees 
sw2613A-ms98-a-0060 262.316625 266.638875 the trees don't scrub the air and there you are 
sw2613A-ms98-a-0061 266.638875 271.487875 and then of course you've got all these folks cutting down on the rain forest as quick as they can
sw2613A-ms98-a-0062 271.487875 274.532750 [silence]
sw2613A-ms98-a-0063 274.532750 279.396125 i wonder too you know they keep talking about ozone depletion and all this
sw2613A-ms98-a-0064 279.396125 286.131125 it it seems funny that it's coming around at the time when we're losing the most most of the forests
sw2613A-ms98-a-0065 286.131125 291.577625 because i i i think that a lot of the pollutants and stuff are being taken out of the air
sw2613A-ms98-a-0066 291.577625 292.856375 uh
sw2613A-ms98-a-0067 292.856375 300.313750 you know by the plants and the trees and all that good stuff and here we are losing it and now the now it doesn't have any where to go
sw2613A-ms98-a-0068 300.313750 302.088375 but ozo[ne]-
sw2613A-ms98-a-0069 302.088375 309.495875 [silence]
sw2613A-ms98-a-0070 309.495875 319.302375 uh-huh yeah well it's like our winter here i mean it was the winter that wasn't you know we were having having hot days in December and January
sw2613A-ms98-a-0071 319.302375 320.692000 and got in
sw2613A-ms98-a-0072 320.692000 322.596000 [silence]
sw2613A-ms98-a-0073 322.596000 324.042875 uh-huh

sw2613A-ms98-a-0076 328.298625 329.734500 uh-huh
sw2613A-ms98-a-0077 329.734500 330.835000 [silence]
sw2613A-ms98-a-0078 330.835000 336.755375 yeah you mi[ght]- you might as well sell it for scrap or something because you probably never will use it
sw2613A-ms98-a-0079 336.755375 341.604125 it's a shame too because i miss all the cold weather i i enjoy winter
sw2613A-ms98-a-0080 341.604125 347.955250 [silence]
sw2613A-ms98-a-0081 347.955250 349.240250 yeah

sw2613A-ms98-a-0083 350.250000 358.742625 yeah we[ll]- it was an interesting day the other day uh i think it was um yeah it was last not not this past Friday but Friday a week ago
sw2613A-ms98-a-0084 358.742625 364.416125 we ha[d]- i don't know i think you had some bad weather up there too we had tornadoes and everything down here
sw2613A-ms98-a-0085 364.416125 372.590625 um that was the most historic weather day in recorded history for severe weather in the country
sw2613A-ms98-a-0086 372.590625 377.903250 on that one day i mean you know of course you always have severe weather somewhere
sw2613A-ms98-a-0087 377.903250 387.435000 but there was more of it on that one day than ever recorded before over four hundred reports of tornadoes hail and heavy winds
sw2613A-ms98-a-0088 387.435000 389.303375 amazing
sw2613A-ms98-a-0089 389.303375 391.180500 it's a little bit scary
sw2613A-ms98-a-0090 391.180500 395.503250 [silence]
sw2613A-ms98-a-0091 395.503250 396.827375 yeah

sw2613A-ms98-a-0093 405.170875 406.727125 um
sw2613A-ms98-a-0094 406.727125 415.410750 i read an article a couple weeks ago they were talking about uh uh talking again about the ozone layer they said that the uh 
sw2613A-ms98-a-0095 415.410750 425.686750 the ozone deterioration is greater than they had originally thought over some of the major metropolitan areas that's a little bit scary to think about 
sw2613A-ms98-a-0096 425.686750 429.716500 because that's certainly not going to improve things around there 
sw2613A-ms98-a-0097 429.716500 434.994625 [silence]
sw2613A-ms98-a-0098 434.994625 436.394875 yeah
sw2613A-ms98-a-0099 436.394875 449.579250 well that's that's yeah that had that had been the thing that had always i mean i i i have always thought about the ozone layer as sort of like a layer and it would move around i didn't know that the hole just stayed there
sw2613A-ms98-a-0100 449.579250 453.619750 you know i guess i i don['t]- i'm not that much of a meteorologist
sw2613A-ms98-a-0101 453.619750 459.982250 but uh yeah i was a little surprised at that too because up to that point all i'd heard about was the one over the pole
sw2613A-ms98-a-0102 459.982250 467.031125 and i said well i'm not too awfully concerned about that if it's going to start melting the ice cap it's not going to be for a long time yet
sw2613A-ms98-a-0103 467.031125 473.942000 but opening opening up over major metropolitan areas now that's [vocalized-noise] that's 
sw2613A-ms98-a-0104 473.942000 481.613500 [silence]
sw2613A-ms98-a-0105 481.613500 483.673375 yeah yeah
sw2613A-ms98-a-0106 483.673375 492.223750 [silence]
sw2613A-ms98-a-0107 492.223750 495.595750 yeah course the ozone is up there so
sw2613A-ms98-a-0108 495.595750 496.766875 [silence]
sw2613A-ms98-a-0109 496.766875 504.057125 yeah i m[ean]- i mean di[dn't]- i don't even know i don't even know if the ozone layer does move i mean apparently it doesn't but 
sw2613A-ms98-a-0110 504.057125 509.714625 of course it it might be just a couple of scientists trying to get their name in the paper sort of like cold fusion [laughter]
sw2613A-ms98-a-0111 509.714625 511.821500 [laughter]
sw2613A-ms98-a-0112 511.821500 512.827125 [silence]
sw2613A-ms98-a-0113 512.827125 519.333500 yeah i'll tell you i i was real excited when i first heard that i said hot dog they finally did it you know
sw2613A-ms98-a-0114 519.333500 524.178375 [silence]
sw2613A-ms98-a-0115 524.178375 526.080125 um i t[oo]-

sw2613A-ms98-a-0118 529.336750 538.156625 yeah i mean i'm an old science fiction buff from way back when i was a little boy and this is the kind of stuff that science fiction was made out of
sw2613A-ms98-a-0119 538.156625 542.904375 and it's the days that i keep looking for [laughter-that] aren't going to happen in my lifetime 
sw2613A-ms98-a-0120 542.904375 544.325875 but [laughter]
sw2613A-ms98-a-0121 544.325875 548.418750 you know we're supposed to have moon colonies by now
sw2613A-ms98-a-0122 548.418750 552.755000 but uh yeah cold fusion would have been great
sw2613A-ms98-a-0123 552.755000 557.474125 could have gone might have started making a little inroads on air pollution with that
sw2613A-ms98-a-0124 557.474125 558.474375 [silence]
sw2613A-ms98-a-0125 558.474375 560.632125 but who knows

sw2613A-ms98-a-0127 563.977625 565.574875 yeah
sw2613A-ms98-a-0128 565.574875 569.691500 yeah there's alway[s]- there's always a drawback to everything i mean 
sw2613A-ms98-a-0129 569.691500 571.800500 i don't know
sw2613A-ms98-a-0130 571.800500 573.588000 well
