sw2613B-ms98-a-0004 3.164625 8.882125 uh i've noticed some changes over the past uh thirty years
sw2613B-ms98-a-0005 8.882125 10.327500 that uh 
sw2613B-ms98-a-0006 10.327500 12.148250 that it's gotten worse
sw2613B-ms98-a-0007 12.148250 17.526000 i can remember uh back in the early sixties when i first started flying a light plane
sw2613B-ms98-a-0008 17.526000 27.998250 it was quite common for me to take off from uh local airport here and see the uh Appalachian mountains and the Chesapeake Bay at the same time
sw2613B-ms98-a-0009 27.998250 36.840250 and in the you know fifteen years later it was a rare occasion that i could see both at the same time
sw2613B-ms98-a-0010 36.840250 38.052750 [silence]
sw2613B-ms98-a-0011 38.052750 47.554000 yeah i know uh lot of times when i was coming back home i would uh file instrument flight plan just to get into the Washington area
sw2613B-ms98-a-0012 47.554000 48.573125 [silence]
sw2613B-ms98-a-0013 48.573125 52.355000 but i counted on North Carolina having some good weather for me
sw2613B-ms98-a-0014 52.355000 61.574250 [silence]
sw2613B-ms98-a-0015 61.574250 62.912750 [laughter]
sw2613B-ms98-a-0016 62.912750 72.159500 well down there you get uh uh some more aromatic aromas like the uh the smell of the pine forest and uh
sw2613B-ms98-a-0017 72.159500 73.167000 [silence]
sw2613B-ms98-a-0018 73.167000 76.424625 then you get down wind of a paper mill once in a while
sw2613B-ms98-a-0019 76.424625 89.832125 [silence]
sw2613B-ms98-a-0020 89.832125 91.097125 um

sw2613B-ms98-a-0024 103.665000 108.881500 well i'm not sure that we're going to be able to uh solve much of the problem
sw2613B-ms98-a-0025 108.881500 113.583625 [silence]
sw2613B-ms98-a-0026 113.583625 114.653250 [noise]

sw2613B-ms98-a-0035 157.376375 159.931625 [silence]
sw2613B-ms98-a-0036 159.931625 167.390375 well one of the reactions i have is that uh they put so much emphasis on the private automobile
sw2613B-ms98-a-0037 167.390375 174.009625 uh as being a major source of pollution and they've uh ignored the trucks entirely
sw2613B-ms98-a-0038 174.009625 181.473125 so i i get to going down the expressway in the morning and uh i don't see very many cars smoking
sw2613B-ms98-a-0039 181.473125 182.738125 but
sw2613B-ms98-a-0040 182.738125 188.352750 then i i get surrounded by twenty or forty trucks and they're just laying out a pall of black smoke 
sw2613B-ms98-a-0041 188.352750 192.286500 [silence]
sw2613B-ms98-a-0042 192.286500 193.546125 yeah

sw2613B-ms98-a-0050 220.740000 225.943125 yeah i know along route sixty six the uh people who have residences there
sw2613B-ms98-a-0051 225.943125 230.657000 uh they can't paint their houses without cleaning them first
sw2613B-ms98-a-0052 230.657000 232.359750 uh
sw2613B-ms98-a-0053 232.359750 238.315500 if they're within a block of a major expressway the houses get coated with oil
sw2613B-ms98-a-0054 238.315500 249.751250 [silence]
sw2613B-ms98-a-0055 249.751250 251.025375 yeah

sw2613B-ms98-a-0059 271.640125 275.664875 yeah i'm not sure that we're not seeing some of the effects of that already
sw2613B-ms98-a-0060 275.664875 285.629750 [silence]
sw2613B-ms98-a-0061 285.629750 286.969250 uh-huh
sw2613B-ms98-a-0062 286.969250 299.529500 [silence]
sw2613B-ms98-a-0063 299.529500 300.877375 yeah
sw2613B-ms98-a-0064 300.877375 312.193250 well we've sort of been seeing a little climatic shift here on the East Coast or at least it seems that way that uh the winters have been milder for the last five years and uh
sw2613B-ms98-a-0065 312.193250 313.628875 [silence]
sw2613B-ms98-a-0066 313.628875 314.934000 yeah
sw2613B-ms98-a-0067 314.934000 319.541375 [silence]
sw2613B-ms98-a-0068 319.541375 329.470125 yeah the first the first winter i moved out here i had a big snow plow on the tractor and i had to use it we had three uh fourteen inch uh snows
sw2613B-ms98-a-0069 329.470125 331.984750 and i haven't used it since
sw2613B-ms98-a-0070 331.984750 341.502625 [silence]
sw2613B-ms98-a-0071 341.502625 351.473500 and at the same time i i see some colder winters in the Midwest i think they've gotten more snow in the past five years than we're having here on the East Coast
sw2613B-ms98-a-0072 351.473500 358.453250 [silence]
sw2613B-ms98-a-0073 358.453250 359.724000 yeah
sw2613B-ms98-a-0074 359.724000 364.009750 [silence]
sw2613B-ms98-a-0075 364.009750 365.334125 uh-huh
sw2613B-ms98-a-0076 365.334125 372.514750 [silence]
sw2613B-ms98-a-0077 372.514750 374.370500 oh i didn't know that
sw2613B-ms98-a-0078 374.370500 386.741250 [silence]
sw2613B-ms98-a-0079 386.741250 387.995375 huh
sw2613B-ms98-a-0080 387.995375 391.082125 [silence]
sw2613B-ms98-a-0081 391.082125 396.242125 well it may have been uh the fact we had this early season warm spell
sw2613B-ms98-a-0082 396.242125 406.058125 that did that because i know that the the pre[ceding]- the preceding day Thursday i got my first sunburn for the season out on uh Ocean City Beach
sw2613B-ms98-a-0083 406.058125 425.861750 [silence]
sw2613B-ms98-a-0084 425.861750 427.203125 yes
sw2613B-ms98-a-0085 427.203125 429.920000 [silence]
sw2613B-ms98-a-0086 429.920000 438.806750 i didn't notice that uh know that they'd discovered any thinness or over me[tro]- metro areas i'd only heard about the uh North and South Pole
sw2613B-ms98-a-0087 438.806750 459.732000 [silence]
sw2613B-ms98-a-0088 459.732000 461.000125 yeah
sw2613B-ms98-a-0089 461.000125 472.175250 [silence]
sw2613B-ms98-a-0090 472.175250 483.310250 yeah that that doesn't uh fit my picture of uh of uh meteorology i can understand the Poles because they're uh a permanent high pressure area
sw2613B-ms98-a-0091 483.310250 486.701250 and uh you know there isn't that much uh circulation
sw2613B-ms98-a-0092 486.701250 493.442625 but uh the temperate zone is uh a constant moving uh wind system
sw2613B-ms98-a-0093 493.442625 497.853500 and it's i'm surprised that the ozone doesn't have it's own wind pattern
sw2613B-ms98-a-0094 497.853500 507.599250 [silence]
sw2613B-ms98-a-0095 507.599250 509.072250 yeah
sw2613B-ms98-a-0096 509.072250 511.297875 cold fusion right
sw2613B-ms98-a-0097 511.297875 513.942625 the same thought flashed in my mind
sw2613B-ms98-a-0098 513.942625 518.368625 [silence]
sw2613B-ms98-a-0099 518.368625 520.575875 yeah i uh
sw2613B-ms98-a-0100 520.575875 525.117500 i may have put out an exclamation here at home when i heard that news
sw2613B-ms98-a-0101 525.117500 530.987000 and uh everybody wanted to know why i was so excited and i tried to explain to them
sw2613B-ms98-a-0102 530.987000 534.462875 [silence]
sw2613B-ms98-a-0103 534.462875 535.721500 yeah

sw2613B-ms98-a-0111 557.274875 558.947750 i think so
sw2613B-ms98-a-0112 558.947750 560.397875 [silence]
sw2613B-ms98-a-0113 560.397875 565.047375 except we might have uh bad case of paladium poisoning now
sw2613B-ms98-a-0114 565.047375 566.226250 [laughter]
sw2613B-ms98-a-0115 566.226250 573.117375 [silence]
sw2613B-ms98-a-0116 573.117375 577.590875 i know there was uh a pipeline going in up in uh
sw2613B-ms98-a-0117 577.590875 579.657750 southern Pennsylvania
sw2613B-ms98-a-0118 579.657750 581.733750 and there was a group
sw2613B-ms98-a-0119 581.733750 585.021250 in uh Bucks county that was fighting it
sw2613B-ms98-a-0120 585.021250 596.786375 and uh one of the women that was leading the group said well they say they're going to pump uh oil through there but before long they'll be pumping radioactivity through it
sw2613B-ms98-a-0121 596.786375 597.841625 [laughter]
