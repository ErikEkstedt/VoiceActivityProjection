sw2646A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 4.794000 dining out seems to be a uh uh something we do off and on
sw2646A-ms98-a-0002 4.794000 12.535875 through our lives i guess as economics and as kids come and go and uh situations change uh we used to do
sw2646A-ms98-a-0003 12.535875 21.755625 quite a bit of dining out before the children and then as they came along and uh additional expenses sitting came into every dinner out um
sw2646A-ms98-a-0004 21.755625 31.419500 that that halted a lot of it as well as just the the uh oh i guess the lifestyle changes a little bit slows down a little bit and
sw2646A-ms98-a-0005 31.419500 38.918375 now even the atmosphere that that we would seek uh when we go out is often more quiet and uh
sw2646A-ms98-a-0006 38.918375 47.496750 a little bit more uh subdued uh not smoke filled or or bar uh dance floor type yeah so
sw2646A-ms98-a-0007 47.496750 59.998250 that uh those type of qualities have uh moved into the picture and then there's there's some economic concern but usually it's if if it's going to be a night out it's going to be a a decent meal and
sw2646A-ms98-a-0008 59.998250 69.715750 and uh fortunately for us there's not a whole lot of places in the immediate area that's totally really expensive you have to go a ways to get to a really
sw2646A-ms98-a-0009 69.715750 81.186500 high dollar uh hundred and fifty dollar dinner type deal which they're forty to fifty miles away and they're they're all around but they're just a ways so we can do a good um
sw2646A-ms98-a-0010 81.186500 87.215500 twenty twenty five dollar night out and have a decent steak and it comes out okay
sw2646A-ms98-a-0011 87.215500 93.968125 uh we look for i guess uh service uh you know i'm not i'm not in
sw2646A-ms98-a-0012 93.968125 103.990500 eating at McDonald's long enough the fastest the speed of it doesn't bother me you know i'm not looking for fast food at that night so the fact that it took them_1 twenty thirty minutes to get it there that's that's okay i'm
sw2646A-ms98-a-0013 103.990500 112.466125 that's twenty minutes away from the kids or however long you know you're out for the evening or it doesn't really matter that they not get it there right away but um
sw2646A-ms98-a-0014 112.466125 125.046375 have a little chime little hard time finding a place that'll cook the steak just right i have to remember how to ask for it for this given restaurant to get it just the way i like it without too much pink in there and uh get it cooked good
sw2646A-ms98-a-0015 125.046375 129.467375 [silence]

sw2646A-ms98-a-0020 144.755500 152.497750 yeah they do oddly enough even being ne[ar]- near the gulf uh they tend to advertise the the main 
sw2646A-ms98-a-0021 152.497750 162.956625 the whole east coast uh seafood for some reason it tends to be a draw i don't know particularly why i mean to me it tastes pretty much the same once you do to it whatever you're going to do to it you know like
sw2646A-ms98-a-0022 162.956625 164.479250 [silence]

sw2646A-ms98-a-0040 371.423875 374.983625 there's a uh one place that
sw2646A-ms98-a-0041 374.983625 388.291000 really not sure if the marketing concept is is carried throughout it's chain but in this particular town um i live about two suburbs north of Dallas actually and in this particular town we're about two miles from this uh
sw2646A-ms98-a-0042 388.291000 392.278125 this steak house that has a
sw2646A-ms98-a-0043 392.278125 403.484500 oh i don't know a motif to the entire uh shopping center it's the anchor for this entire strip shopping center i guess and they'll the entire place is
sw2646A-ms98-a-0044 403.484500 410.494125 um has covered walkways all around to all the little shops that are they're not
sw2646A-ms98-a-0045 410.494125 423.956000 they're not even individual shops in some cases some cases are just kind of you they they put it all out in a little store shed out on to an area and then they put it all away at night um then there are there's one two whole rows actually of
sw2646A-ms98-a-0046 423.956000 435.287000 of just what we would call a stall of flat concrete place with little posts and they're all marked off with little lines and so if you want to rent this little spot though the farmers bring their stuff down and have a farmers market type
sw2646A-ms98-a-0047 435.287000 447.299500 so we went to this steak house once uh well several times but the most particular time that we were away from the kids and and had a a good length of time and it was on a Friday night and we knew the place would be really busy but we
sw2646A-ms98-a-0048 447.299500 456.080500 we got there about uh six or six thirty and put our names on the list of of the waiting list and then we walked around the uh the place that has
sw2646A-ms98-a-0049 456.080500 467.751375 there were still some farmers there at the time there was a lot of hand uh craft type stuff being sold uh there was a blacksmith and he's showing off his little traits and things that he could sell as well as uh
sw2646A-ms98-a-0050 467.751375 477.741375 uh the hallways between the places that were of of business the hallways were decorated with uh old pictures and history of the of the town as it were
sw2646A-ms98-a-0051 477.741375 488.717125 we killed about a an hour or so doing that because it was about an hour and a half wait to get into the restaurant and uh then about thirty minutes worth of a meal or so thirty or forty five minutes there and then
sw2646A-ms98-a-0052 488.717125 499.430625 uh came back out and walked around a little bit more and went home so it it's quite an interesting uh deal they don't even take reservations because they're so booked like that that uh
