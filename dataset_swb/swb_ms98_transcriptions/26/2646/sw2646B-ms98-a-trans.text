sw2646B-ms98-a-0025 123.741250 130.271750 i imagine uh in in Texas there would be uh a lot of steak restaurants is that right
sw2646B-ms98-a-0026 130.271750 131.719125 yes
sw2646B-ms98-a-0027 131.719125 141.588875 um-hum and now on this area of course here in Maryland you're close to the Chesapeake there seems to there is some there are some steak restaurants but they lean more towards seafood here
sw2646B-ms98-a-0028 141.588875 144.988000 uh you probably have seafood a lot also
sw2646B-ms98-a-0029 144.988000 155.977125 [silence]
sw2646B-ms98-a-0030 155.977125 159.259250 oh is that right [laughter]
sw2646B-ms98-a-0031 159.259250 160.752000 [silence]
sw2646B-ms98-a-0032 160.752000 165.288375 right well do you have crabs and lobster in that area that's
sw2646B-ms98-a-0033 165.288375 167.322500 yeah that's that's
sw2646B-ms98-a-0034 167.322500 170.494500 hum that's funny that they would [laughter]
sw2646B-ms98-a-0035 170.494500 172.000500 [silence]
sw2646B-ms98-a-0036 172.000500 176.499500 right right right and you probably have craw[fish]- would you have crawfish
sw2646B-ms98-a-0037 176.499500 178.218500 [silence]
sw2646B-ms98-a-0038 178.218500 179.735750 yeah
sw2646B-ms98-a-0039 179.735750 180.755375 [silence]
sw2646B-ms98-a-0040 180.755375 181.984875 yeah
sw2646B-ms98-a-0041 181.984875 188.978625 well a lot of what you said uh sounds similar to us i remember that uh bef[ore]- before we had children we have
sw2646B-ms98-a-0042 188.978625 195.225875 two boys that are like nine and six and actually the oldest one is just starting to
sw2646B-ms98-a-0043 195.225875 200.628500 learn to behave [laughter-in] [laughter-a] [laughter-restaurant] so before we had kids we would
sw2646B-ms98-a-0044 200.628500 206.976625 definitely dine out more frequently probably several times a week and it didn't have to be
sw2646B-ms98-a-0045 206.976625 215.974375 necessarily anything fancy but it was more uh a matter of before children say we were both working we didn't feel like cooking we just went out
sw2646B-ms98-a-0046 215.974375 227.187875 and now you know as you said once you've children that's not always an option uh i worked off and on um you know because they were little and
sw2646B-ms98-a-0047 227.187875 232.205750 and and also you know once you're home and you have them um
sw2646B-ms98-a-0048 232.205750 238.288500 [noise] places that you went before spur of the moment that might be nice but casual um
sw2646B-ms98-a-0049 238.288500 248.173250 sometimes it's not [laughter-worth] [laughter-it] to go through the trouble of digging the sitters and everything just to go and so what i have found now that um
sw2646B-ms98-a-0050 248.173250 256.769750 when we do go out uh as you said you out on the t[own]- now when we go out it's it's you want it to be more special [laughter]
sw2646B-ms98-a-0051 256.769750 271.206625 you don't want to just uh necessarily run out for you know a one hour and come back i noticed with us it's more when we do go out then we do try to make it something nice maybe a dinner theater or nice restaurant with friends
sw2646B-ms98-a-0052 271.206625 276.303000 um sometimes lunches when we can do that that's okay too but
sw2646B-ms98-a-0053 276.303000 286.723875 um it definitely you know it definitely changes is changed we maybe eat in somewhat nicer places now but that's because when we do [laughter-go]
sw2646B-ms98-a-0054 286.723875 292.541000 there's so there's li[ke]- a special quality to that because it is a few hours [laughter-away] [laughter-from] [laughter-the] [laughter-kids]
sw2646B-ms98-a-0055 292.541000 296.323625 and um but not as often we don't do it as often
sw2646B-ms98-a-0056 296.323625 304.128125 um and what i'm finding now is they're finally getting to the age where we're venturing into going again with them
sw2646B-ms98-a-0057 304.128125 313.294875 and of course when you take them though you're going to go to something like a McDonald's level or maybe a little bit of a family style restaurant
sw2646B-ms98-a-0058 313.294875 314.478125 uh
sw2646B-ms98-a-0059 314.478125 323.958000 but in this area there there are quite a few decent restaurants that are not too expensive and uh
sw2646B-ms98-a-0060 323.958000 327.749625 i- i- i tend to agree with you too we look for more um 
sw2646B-ms98-a-0061 327.749625 342.474750 uh quiet ty[pe]- more of a subdued atmosphere now and i think part of that is after you have kids you're you're not as interested in going to uh Georgetown type places where you know you go in every place and there's a lot of uh noise [laughter]
sw2646B-ms98-a-0062 342.474750 350.430000 yelling and uh you know you look for different things and that crowd seems to change and you know you're not as much part of it
sw2646B-ms98-a-0063 350.430000 364.301375 um and you don't there are more decent restaurants moving out to the suburbs you know and that type of thing uh you don't necessarily have to go downtown DC to to find decent restaurants and uh
sw2646B-ms98-a-0064 364.301375 372.431375 there's a lot that are moderately priced also whether you're in the suburbs or go downtown so there's there's quite a selection in this area
sw2646B-ms98-a-0065 372.431375 383.979625 [silence]
sw2646B-ms98-a-0066 383.979625 385.526250 um-hum

sw2646B-ms98-a-0073 435.949125 459.966625 [silence]
sw2646B-ms98-a-0074 459.966625 462.428375 yeah that's nice
sw2646B-ms98-a-0075 462.428375 475.174250 [silence]
sw2646B-ms98-a-0076 475.174250 476.781875 um-hum
sw2646B-ms98-a-0077 476.781875 481.963250 [silence]
sw2646B-ms98-a-0078 481.963250 484.270750 wow [laughter]
sw2646B-ms98-a-0079 484.270750 497.256625 [silence]
sw2646B-ms98-a-0080 497.256625 507.999250 wow jeez well if i'm here also there's been such a growth in in housing uh not in the last year but before that it was just
sw2646B-ms98-a-0081 507.999250 522.029750 i don't know if you've been in this area in the last few years but it's just been incredible and and has it's gone crazy i mean where we are was basically a farm ten years ago and it's houses are stacked and what has happened really is that
sw2646B-ms98-a-0082 522.029750 524.788125 um some of the commercial um
sw2646B-ms98-a-0083 524.788125 538.472875 uh places have not caught up with the population here and so we do have a problem of the the half decent restaurants when you go on a Friday or Saturday night you're looking for quite a long wait
sw2646B-ms98-a-0084 538.472875 548.487375 and um not all of them do take reservations either [laughter-so] so you sometimes have to allot yourself uh enough time
sw2646B-ms98-a-0085 548.487375 555.195375 um you know to go out uh you can't figure on going out and being back in two hours [laughter-you] [laughter-know]
sw2646B-ms98-a-0086 555.195375 568.692000 um the other thing that's changing here is because of the um the age set here uh a lot mostly people in they're i'd say late twenties to early forties in these neighborhoods that
sw2646B-ms98-a-0087 568.692000 578.768125 uh we haven't done it because i don't think it will work well with us having two boys but um some of the more expensive restaurants now i understand are catering
sw2646B-ms98-a-0088 578.768125 588.489125 um to children and making half price menus for them whereas before um they would be totally discouraged from bringing children in
sw2646B-ms98-a-0089 588.489125 600.445000 and they're doing this basically because they're so many working parents in this area and that they were [laughter-losing] the business because once all these younger people were having children they weren't going to the restaurants
