sw2604B-ms98-a-0003 8.822000 11.112000 right uh [noise]
sw2604B-ms98-a-0004 11.112000 13.908500 who wants to start this one
sw2604B-ms98-a-0005 13.908500 26.861875 [silence]
sw2604B-ms98-a-0006 26.861875 28.503250 right right
sw2604B-ms98-a-0007 28.503250 40.322375 [silence]
sw2604B-ms98-a-0008 40.322375 47.494375 i'm not sure i want an eighteen year old to make that kind of decision uh i mean uh that that doesn't sound right
sw2604B-ms98-a-0009 47.494375 53.050125 um i guess i see overall beneficial if we're if we're just going from that point of view 
sw2604B-ms98-a-0010 53.050125 64.422750 um i- you know in the past i don't know i don't know how old you are but when i was uh in high school was uh beginning of Vietnam and so forth and many of my peers were being drafted
sw2604B-ms98-a-0011 64.422750 70.916875 and i could see that many of them had conscientious objections to war or whatever
sw2604B-ms98-a-0012 70.916875 81.004250 but i i felt strongly then that even if they didn't feel like they could kill someone or go into a military situation that that they could help the country in other ways 
sw2604B-ms98-a-0013 81.004250 89.887625 be it cleaning out uh lots in in their neighborhood or whatever kind of community or public service might be available
sw2604B-ms98-a-0014 89.887625 98.271500 and i guess i see that as as not so much a a demand but but a privilege it's it's kind of uh uh
sw2604B-ms98-a-0015 98.271500 99.286875 [silence]
sw2604B-ms98-a-0016 99.286875 112.387125 it's something i[t's]- it's since since we live here and we all benefit rich poor or in between uh there are benefits even for those who have it the hardest i just see that as maybe a good idea i wouldn't mind doing it at forty four 
sw2604B-ms98-a-0017 112.387125 122.846250 uh and i find ways to to turn some of that back to to others uh and i i guess i i can't see that as being something to really object to
sw2604B-ms98-a-0018 122.846250 141.013500 [silence]
sw2604B-ms98-a-0019 141.013500 150.824000 i could see a a full a run a gamut of different kinds of opportunities things that need to be done that wou[ld]- that could be done in an hour or two
sw2604B-ms98-a-0020 150.824000 157.286625 uh a day or several hours of the week like a half of a day on Saturday or something like that in addition to what one does
sw2604B-ms98-a-0021 157.286625 162.581375 uh besides that i i can't imagine what kind of uh
sw2604B-ms98-a-0022 162.581375 171.597750 uh bureaucracies we'd get into and expense having it be full time oh you're going to go to this camp and you're going to you know like um
sw2604B-ms98-a-0023 171.597750 182.037625 back in the Depression the CCC the the construction corps that went out and did things that was great it was needed it gave folks some jobs and we got some great public works out of it but
sw2604B-ms98-a-0024 182.037625 188.715625 um i don't see that as being necessary now i can see it being done uh on a regular schedule
sw2604B-ms98-a-0025 188.715625 195.597875 uh everybody has to put in so many hours of uh public service in a given time perhaps
sw2604B-ms98-a-0026 195.597875 200.848375 uh i i guess i see all of us benefiting and i i don't see it just relegated to the young
sw2604B-ms98-a-0027 200.848375 210.871125 but i see i i see so much going on that that's bad and this would give them a chance to have some positive self esteem something that they turn back
sw2604B-ms98-a-0028 210.871125 215.351750 [silence]
sw2604B-ms98-a-0029 215.351750 224.186250 that's right you take pride in that and and get some some positive feedback from those who benefit besides yourself
sw2604B-ms98-a-0030 224.186250 234.005375 and i i see it being most beneficial if it's in the neighborhood where or or at least the area where the person lives it may not be the same neighborhood but the same city or county
sw2604B-ms98-a-0031 234.005375 244.704000 because then you're you're coming in contact with it it's not as meaningful for me to go to Minnesota and do something up there that i'll never be able to see again unless i happen to go on vacation up there
sw2604B-ms98-a-0032 244.704000 247.936375 it's so it almost needs to be something that has more
sw2604B-ms98-a-0033 247.936375 251.297000 impact for the individual on going
sw2604B-ms98-a-0034 251.297000 252.509750 [silence]
sw2604B-ms98-a-0035 252.509750 261.890000 but as far as putting that into work i don't want to [laughter] i don't want to deal with the with the heartache of first of all getting it started and figuring out how to do the logistics
sw2604B-ms98-a-0036 261.890000 267.364750 [silence]
sw2604B-ms98-a-0037 267.364750 268.487625 yeah
sw2604B-ms98-a-0038 268.487625 270.042375 [silence]
sw2604B-ms98-a-0039 270.042375 274.922875 i i see a lot of things like uh scouting uh
sw2604B-ms98-a-0040 274.922875 286.163125 Boys Clubs Girls Clubs things like that that kind of get into that citizenship uh the uh looking after the environment sort of thing and and i guess i don't see
sw2604B-ms98-a-0041 286.163125 289.448500 uh this being that different
sw2604B-ms98-a-0042 289.448500 296.175875 but even more beneficial because it would be something that everybody participated in and would take a turn in
sw2604B-ms98-a-0043 296.175875 299.359875 [silence]
sw2604B-ms98-a-0044 299.359875 301.071250 do you have kids
sw2604B-ms98-a-0045 301.071250 303.801375 [silence]
sw2604B-ms98-a-0046 303.801375 312.023500 oh well good good you have a little time think about that i guess i- i have uh when i was teaching school i saw many ki[ds]- so many kids that were at loose ends
sw2604B-ms98-a-0047 312.023500 318.549000 and that didn't really have a purpose and i can see you know some some really significant things coming out of it
sw2604B-ms98-a-0048 318.549000 323.708375 i know you've got to get past that that grudge attitude that many have but that's uh
sw2604B-ms98-a-0049 323.708375 337.757875 tha[t]- that would be a part of selling it to the community to the adults ahead of them that probably would never serve and and to each succeeding generation there'd definitely have to be a major PR campaign in each community each county
sw2604B-ms98-a-0050 337.757875 342.071750 uh parish or however the state was divided up
sw2604B-ms98-a-0051 342.071750 349.178125 hum i may well i don't know around here we have a number of community projects that folks just volunteer for
sw2604B-ms98-a-0052 349.178125 359.836375 Boy Scout troops or church groups or civic clubs will uh police a uh a couple of miles of the highway and kee[p]- and i i've seen it in other states too i don't know
sw2604B-ms98-a-0053 359.836375 361.396750 um
sw2604B-ms98-a-0054 361.396750 368.675875 [silence]
sw2604B-ms98-a-0055 368.675875 371.892500 [laughter]
sw2604B-ms98-a-0056 371.892500 372.987750 [laughter]
sw2604B-ms98-a-0057 372.987750 375.922000 and there were those that said no you can't do that i'm sure
sw2604B-ms98-a-0058 375.922000 378.992500 [silence]
sw2604B-ms98-a-0059 378.992500 380.103000 yeah
sw2604B-ms98-a-0060 380.103000 385.150500 [silence]
sw2604B-ms98-a-0061 385.150500 392.907750 oh and i hadn't even thought about that uh the oth[er]- the other end of that that that's an interesting uh situation i hadn't thought of that
sw2604B-ms98-a-0062 392.907750 403.715875 we had visited relatives in Virginia not too long ago and i thought i had seen when we were traveling around the state some similar signs up that indicated that certain sections were being policed and cleaned up and
sw2604B-ms98-a-0063 403.715875 416.134000 [silence]
sw2604B-ms98-a-0064 416.134000 426.439125 and i don't know about your part of the country but uh down here in the last y[ear]- oh year plus i it was las[t]- beginning with last year's Earth Day
sw2604B-ms98-a-0065 426.439125 436.308625 there's just been more of a turn toward uh environmental concerns and e[ven]- i work for Texas Instruments and they they've started some recycling campaigns that
sw2604B-ms98-a-0066 436.308625 441.573625 a year before that had been turned down because_1 they said well it's not feasible it's not a good idea
sw2604B-ms98-a-0067 441.573625 444.170250 and i see that as being
sw2604B-ms98-a-0068 444.170250 452.233000 i i see that as being a a a change um it for the positive kind of along the same line as as as the mandatory thing it's just thing
sw2604B-ms98-a-0069 452.233000 454.762375 a part of everyone's consciousness
sw2604B-ms98-a-0070 454.762375 460.794625 [silence]
sw2604B-ms98-a-0071 460.794625 462.051000 yeah
sw2604B-ms98-a-0072 462.051000 479.042250 [silence]
sw2604B-ms98-a-0073 479.042250 485.532500 i'm sure the pendulum will swing the other way uh there have been too many other things that it's done that for just in my life
sw2604B-ms98-a-0074 485.532500 494.768125 and if you look at history at all you see that you know uh we go from one side to the other on just about any subject that you one might care to bring up but
sw2604B-ms98-a-0075 494.768125 505.911000 it is comforting to me to see uh more concern about some of these things that that cost us money especially when we have dwindling uh resources such as oil that's
sw2604B-ms98-a-0076 505.911000 513.704250 burning out of control in [laughter-in] the Persian Gulf and and so forth just just every little bit does
sw2604B-ms98-a-0077 513.704250 521.995000 it makes me feel better it it makes me feel like well there may be something left for my children my nieces and nephews and so forth
sw2604B-ms98-a-0078 521.995000 532.900250 [silence]
sw2604B-ms98-a-0079 532.900250 535.407375 that's that's right because
sw2604B-ms98-a-0080 535.407375 537.868250 [silence]
sw2604B-ms98-a-0081 537.868250 541.677250 uh no [laughter] no because if
sw2604B-ms98-a-0082 541.677250 542.570500 [laughter]
sw2604B-ms98-a-0083 542.570500 553.900375 we what was it in seventy four when we had the the last last oil crisis an[d]- and uh we started getting smart and and we were looking all these alternative sources of energy and so forth
sw2604B-ms98-a-0084 553.900375 561.986125 and as soon as the oil prices came back down we the pendulum swung the other way and we need those reminders
sw2604B-ms98-a-0085 561.986125 570.222125 uh or we'll suddenly be in the dark and say oh my goodness now we don't have the ability to go on to some new technology
sw2604B-ms98-a-0086 570.222125 572.259500 [silence]
sw2604B-ms98-a-0087 572.259500 574.111125 ah
sw2604B-ms98-a-0088 574.111125 576.712625 [silence]
sw2604B-ms98-a-0089 576.712625 578.578250 i'm sure you are

sw2604B-ms98-a-0091 581.297500 583.612750 [silence]
sw2604B-ms98-a-0092 583.612750 591.922625 well i thi[s]- you know just about anybody you could name whether i voted for them or not uh makes um uh
sw2604B-ms98-a-0093 591.922625 600.214625 decisions that i just can't go along with but uh that's why they're there and not me i don't want the i don't want the [laughter-stress] and the strain
