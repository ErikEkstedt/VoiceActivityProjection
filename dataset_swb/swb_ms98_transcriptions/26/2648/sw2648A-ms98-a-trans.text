sw2648A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.727250 [noise]
sw2648A-ms98-a-0002 0.727250 6.025750 so well this is an appropriate topic the day after Earth Day [laughter-i] [laughter-thought] 
sw2648A-ms98-a-0003 6.025750 7.137500 [silence]
sw2648A-ms98-a-0004 7.137500 12.965375 um [noise] well what do you think is uh the pollutants the main pollutants in the air
sw2648A-ms98-a-0005 12.965375 21.881625 [silence]
sw2648A-ms98-a-0006 21.881625 27.888625 yeah that's me too after um on channel thirteen uh they had some
sw2648A-ms98-a-0007 27.888625 37.499125 some programs the day before and i'm not sure that about yesterday we didn't really watch it too much yesterday but the day before they had a lot of programs about the environment and
sw2648A-ms98-a-0008 37.499125 48.714125 you know how we're affecting the Earth and things by what we do as the people and and they mentioned sulfur and carbon dioxide a lot and that actually um
sw2648A-ms98-a-0009 48.714125 59.670500 as our population increases and you know our of course our our cars you know our number of cars increase per the population that's the problem but also like you said
sw2648A-ms98-a-0010 59.670500 66.342625 the industry pollution and you know they're reg[ulation]- they're regulation that's placed on them is
sw2648A-ms98-a-0011 66.342625 78.542750 i mean it's better than it used to be but it's incredible that they still don't have you know they don't they're not made to regulate the amount of pollutants that they put into the air
sw2648A-ms98-a-0012 78.542750 82.487750 you know i i just i can't stand that and i know for a fact
sw2648A-ms98-a-0013 82.487750 92.739500 that they get away with a lot that you know they're supposed to be regulated because we have a we have a plant i don't know about TI but we have a plant uh a Pillsbury plant
sw2648A-ms98-a-0014 92.739500 100.253875 in in a town adjacent to ours and i know people that work there that of course you wouldn't think Pillsbury would put out certain chemicals
sw2648A-ms98-a-0015 100.253875 105.285250 but they put out toxic chemicals there just in some of the um
sw2648A-ms98-a-0016 105.285250 110.476625 what they do uh to uh make their dough and st[uff]- to
sw2648A-ms98-a-0017 110.476625 115.904375 clean out the flour and stuff like that yeah i mean it's incredible and um
sw2648A-ms98-a-0018 115.904375 124.763625 they said that they're you know they have a little creek that runs by them and some of the people that work there have told me that when they have inspectors coming
sw2648A-ms98-a-0019 124.763625 132.110000 they you know shut down everything and they clean up their act but on a normal basis that they're that they're dumping things
sw2648A-ms98-a-0020 132.110000 136.511000 that they're not supposed to be dumping and i'm like if they're getting away with it
sw2648A-ms98-a-0021 136.511000 141.700000 can you imagine that's a that's a Pillsbury plant i can't imagine plants
sw2648A-ms98-a-0022 141.700000 145.653875 [silence]
sw2648A-ms98-a-0023 145.653875 160.554375 yeah they have chemicals that they use to refine their flours with and stuff you know to to break the flours down and then they they also do testing there and i don't you know wh[en]- when you consider you know it's probably not radioactive but toxic can be
sw2648A-ms98-a-0024 160.554375 165.660500 can be anything that's [vocalized-noise] uh classified that can damage the Earth
sw2648A-ms98-a-0025 165.660500 174.867875 so there could be a lot of things that they could put you know that {chemicalwise} that they use to uh that they are testing with
sw2648A-ms98-a-0026 174.867875 176.752375 that they're dumping
sw2648A-ms98-a-0027 176.752375 179.514750 yeah
sw2648A-ms98-a-0028 179.514750 191.843875 yeah i don't think they do the packaging at this plant but they do they do a lot of research and they do um they do do a lot of the refining up there or i'm not really what's it called when you do flour i'm not
sw2648A-ms98-a-0029 191.843875 194.630125 [silence]
sw2648A-ms98-a-0030 194.630125 195.716875 yeah
sw2648A-ms98-a-0031 195.716875 196.749750 [silence]
sw2648A-ms98-a-0032 196.749750 198.753500 yeah but
sw2648A-ms98-a-0033 198.753500 207.311625 [silence]
sw2648A-ms98-a-0034 207.311625 208.713500 uh-huh
sw2648A-ms98-a-0035 208.713500 215.262750 [silence]
sw2648A-ms98-a-0036 215.262750 216.297125 yeah
sw2648A-ms98-a-0037 216.297125 217.304250 [silence]
sw2648A-ms98-a-0038 217.304250 225.968500 but i mean you think about it it you know it's probably a lot easier to detect things that go into the ground than it is
sw2648A-ms98-a-0039 225.968500 239.423625 maybe to just i'm not really sure but i would think it would be easier to detect those things because you could detect them down [strean/stream] or stream or such or you can you can you know do uh testing on the ground itself at that point
sw2648A-ms98-a-0040 239.423625 247.157000 but when they pollute into the air and you've got you know and you've got movement through the air it's going to move a lot of that off so i don't see
sw2648A-ms98-a-0041 247.157000 261.033875 you know how they can do some of the te[sts]- unless it just hangs there like in places where it's a lot of pollution you know like in Los Angeles or or the bigger cities where it it tends to get stuck there you know that you have a lot more particles in the air
sw2648A-ms98-a-0042 261.033875 267.594375 you know per per uh per particles in the surrounding community because it's not moved away
sw2648A-ms98-a-0043 267.594375 268.941750 but um
sw2648A-ms98-a-0044 268.941750 273.835375 [silence]
sw2648A-ms98-a-0045 273.835375 275.097875 uh-huh
sw2648A-ms98-a-0046 275.097875 281.332000 [silence]
sw2648A-ms98-a-0047 281.332000 285.941875 yeah well i know out in some i'm not sure
sw2648A-ms98-a-0048 285.941875 291.682625 i can't remember the name of the county it's it's where Stillwater is or
sw2648A-ms98-a-0049 291.682625 302.141000 Sweet no i'm not sure i know it i think it's uh i know we have a piece property there it's called Dublin it's in Dublin Texas i'm not really sure what the county it's Stephen no Stephenville
sw2648A-ms98-a-0050 302.141000 309.148000 okay where Stephenville's at they've had a lot of problems because they've um introduced a lot of dairies there
sw2648A-ms98-a-0051 309.148000 315.910250 so they have a lot of cattle in the area i mean they've got like per per ya[rd]- uh per lot
sw2648A-ms98-a-0052 315.910250 318.430750 you know they've got like a lot of head of cattle
sw2648A-ms98-a-0053 318.430750 331.473500 because_1 dairies they don't th[e]- th[e]- it's not like it was a big ranch where they let the cow roam around free they've got to have them there to be able to milk them and they and i read in this article i couldn't believe it where you know like one cow produces like
sw2648A-ms98-a-0054 331.473500 336.171000 a day produces like a hundred or so pounds of manure
sw2648A-ms98-a-0055 336.171000 350.607250 one cow i was like my God and they and this thing says that that you know i[f]- people think well cow manure is good for fertilizer but when you get that much manure it says it becomes a real problem because it's not it's not
sw2648A-ms98-a-0056 350.607250 358.048875 when you know you buy cow manure at the store they've added stuff to it and they've added humus and stuff that breaks it down and and this
sw2648A-ms98-a-0057 358.048875 372.528250 and this article said that they've got a real problem that um you've got toxins and and uh bacteria in the manure that is what it's doing is it's going through uh they don't have a very deep um oh
sw2648A-ms98-a-0058 372.528250 374.454625 you know they're water
sw2648A-ms98-a-0059 374.454625 376.903125 they're natural water uh
sw2648A-ms98-a-0060 376.903125 383.561125 i forget what that's called with you know it's like a spring spring water but it's below the surface it's not very far down
sw2648A-ms98-a-0061 383.561125 390.948625 and all this stuff is seeping through to the water and they're like they're afraid that you know within a certain amount of years
sw2648A-ms98-a-0062 390.948625 399.214500 that it's they're wa[ter]- they're water in that town will be totally polluted and they won't be able to have any drinking water because they will have um polluted
sw2648A-ms98-a-0063 399.214500 407.566750 completely polluted so that they're you know there's too many toxins and bacterial growth and i'm like my God you know
sw2648A-ms98-a-0064 407.566750 413.385625 just from that one you know just from them introducing dairy farms in that one county
sw2648A-ms98-a-0065 413.385625 416.335375 [silence]
sw2648A-ms98-a-0066 416.335375 422.761125 no not when you figure i didn't realize a cow one cow produces that much manure and they were talking like
sw2648A-ms98-a-0067 422.761125 429.517625 thousands of cows you know they were talking thousands cows in one little tiny area you
sw2648A-ms98-a-0068 429.517625 431.967875 [silence]
sw2648A-ms98-a-0069 431.967875 439.080000 well they are evidently but um i mean ev[en]- evidently a normal cow produces that much too
sw2648A-ms98-a-0070 439.080000 443.871250 but they're just so spread out on ranches and stuff that it's not you know a problem
sw2648A-ms98-a-0071 443.871250 456.944000 but when they get them in these tiny little areas you know and they've got a real big problem and they they said that that what they were doing was scraping it with bulldozers and stuff and taking it to uh these
sw2648A-ms98-a-0072 456.944000 468.127000 like ponds that they had to filter it with but the ponds because they've had so much rain in the past few years they just overflow and they overflow into the the creeks and stuff in the area
sw2648A-ms98-a-0073 468.127000 482.989500 so that just creates you know there there's and oh it was just disgusting it said the creeks will foam people people stand outside their houses and their watch the creeks foam brown and all and i'm just like oh my gosh and the smell is really bad they say
sw2648A-ms98-a-0074 482.989500 487.669625 [silence]
sw2648A-ms98-a-0075 487.669625 492.671875 yeah but i i don't know it really frightens me though as far as the
sw2648A-ms98-a-0076 492.671875 500.197125 when you think about the you know thinking of just air pollution itself and then and channel thirteen they're really um
sw2648A-ms98-a-0077 500.197125 513.219500 emphasizing the problem with acid rain you know if we if we keep putting that stuff into the air and and you know if we keep creating the problem and not doing anything about it that it's really going to be a problem for um
sw2648A-ms98-a-0078 513.219500 521.174125 just the the Earth you know what the Earth is receiving back you know because how can you tell where it's going to come down at
sw2648A-ms98-a-0079 521.174125 524.796125 [silence]
sw2648A-ms98-a-0080 524.796125 526.195125 yeah
sw2648A-ms98-a-0081 526.195125 528.274875 the rain forest and all
sw2648A-ms98-a-0082 528.274875 544.421125 [silence]
sw2648A-ms98-a-0083 544.421125 545.831375 yeah
sw2648A-ms98-a-0084 545.831375 547.752750 [silence]
sw2648A-ms98-a-0085 547.752750 556.023375 well they do because what is it carbon dioxide they use that where we can't synthesize it and they're synthesizing it for us
sw2648A-ms98-a-0086 556.023375 557.542000 [silence]
sw2648A-ms98-a-0087 557.542000 558.641250 yeah
sw2648A-ms98-a-0088 558.641250 564.228125 [silence]
sw2648A-ms98-a-0089 564.228125 571.597625 yeah i think we just have to i don't know personally you know i suppose you know if you just make sure your car is
sw2648A-ms98-a-0090 571.597625 577.157500 is working properly and you you know they're suppose nowadays they have the emission controls on them but
sw2648A-ms98-a-0091 577.157500 582.804250 uh i think the only the main thing is just keep on the legis[lators']- your legislators' back
sw2648A-ms98-a-0092 582.804250 584.283000 you know as far as
sw2648A-ms98-a-0093 584.283000 598.059875 seems like they've only just really started as far as the environment saying okay we're really going to get involved it it's really becoming a problem by the year two thousand there will what what are we going to have what kind of results are we going to have for the environment and
sw2648A-ms98-a-0094 598.059875 598.939875 and what will we
