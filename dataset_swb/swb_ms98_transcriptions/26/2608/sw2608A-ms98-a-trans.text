sw2608A-ms98-a-0012 26.946875 36.001250 yes and what's really neat about it is the shrimp is cooked in your uh like your rice steamer your rice cooker
sw2608A-ms98-a-0013 36.001250 40.336250 and um you place the shrimp in the
sw2608A-ms98-a-0014 40.336250 46.374375 in the rice steamer and you put a bay leaf and put some uh red pepper over it
sw2608A-ms98-a-0015 46.374375 54.024250 now you can either use you know the kind that comes in the little can or you can just get some you know regular red peppers

sw2608A-ms98-a-0017 56.824125 61.013250 and you put a little bit of that over it now if you use the dried kind
sw2608A-ms98-a-0018 61.013250 67.341875 then you would only use two of them and you put that in there and then you pour two bottles of beer over it
sw2608A-ms98-a-0019 67.341875 68.393875 [silence]
sw2608A-ms98-a-0020 68.393875 69.776250 two pounds
sw2608A-ms98-a-0021 69.776250 74.747125 that's the jumbo shrimp in the shells leave the shells on them so they won't just roll up
sw2608A-ms98-a-0022 74.747125 81.057750 and you pour the beer over the top of it and you cover it and you only cook it until the mixture begins to boil
sw2608A-ms98-a-0023 81.057750 88.451250 and the shrimp turn pink then you remove it and you put it on a platter and then you serve it with melted butter and uh
sw2608A-ms98-a-0024 88.451250 91.183625 i usually put garlic powder in mine
sw2608A-ms98-a-0025 91.183625 95.353875 and they can just dip it and they shell it as they eat it
sw2608A-ms98-a-0026 95.353875 105.376500 but uh then the mi[crowave]- uh the cauliflower you cook that in the microwave and what you do is you just uh wash it and you core it
sw2608A-ms98-a-0027 105.376500 113.704375 and in a like a oh what do you call it like Pyrex or something like that kind of bowl that would go in the microwave
sw2608A-ms98-a-0028 113.704375 117.712000 uh-huh but it's got to have one that has a cover on it
sw2608A-ms98-a-0029 117.712000 126.638625 and you uh put about two tablespoons of uh water into this bowl and about an eighth a teaspoon of salt
sw2608A-ms98-a-0030 126.638625 132.587250 and then you just set your cauliflower in there and then you cook it for seven minutes on high and you rotate it one time

sw2608A-ms98-a-0032 134.235750 139.568750 uh-huh y[ou]- uh when you core it you be real careful so you won't knock your flowers off
sw2608A-ms98-a-0033 139.568750 149.540500 and uh you just set it in there and you microwave it on high for seven minutes and you turn it one time and while that's cooking i take mayonnaise about a cup of mayonnaise
sw2608A-ms98-a-0034 149.540500 157.221000 and a teaspoon of mustard and some garlic powder and i mix it all together and i shred up some just regular white cheese
sw2608A-ms98-a-0035 157.221000 167.664250 and after that's cooked you take it out and pour this on top of it and then you sprinkle the cheese on top of that and you cook it for another three minutes on high
sw2608A-ms98-a-0036 167.664250 172.987625 you know just mainly to melt the cheese and everything and let all the seasoning melt into it and it's done
