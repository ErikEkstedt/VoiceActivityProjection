sw2630B-ms98-a-0005 13.684375 18.269750 [silence]
sw2630B-ms98-a-0006 18.269750 23.539625 no but that's one of the reasons why he chose Williams that it has solid liberal arts

sw2630B-ms98-a-0008 24.579500 26.580375 about two thousand

sw2630B-ms98-a-0017 59.677250 67.025625 well i i one of the the advises we've given our children is that you can always learn a job
sw2630B-ms98-a-0018 67.025625 68.361500 [vocalized-noise]
sw2630B-ms98-a-0019 68.361500 74.141750 uh but what you can't learn uh on a job is
sw2630B-ms98-a-0020 74.141750 77.917625 a good solid well r[ounded]- well rounded education
sw2630B-ms98-a-0021 77.917625 87.177250 that's right you know the Renaissance man and uh and if you get that you can and if you do well you can you can learn a job

sw2630B-ms98-a-0025 92.739875 101.656125 that's right so the advice we gave to them was number one visit the colleges that you're thinking about describe first of all
sw2630B-ms98-a-0026 101.656125 104.501500 the size school that you might be interested in
sw2630B-ms98-a-0027 104.501500 107.879250 do you want to go away how far from home do you want to be
sw2630B-ms98-a-0028 107.879250 113.355125 what do you want in a college now my son is a national level competitive swimmer
sw2630B-ms98-a-0029 113.355125 118.125875 so he wanted to swim in school but he did not want to be in a swim factory

sw2630B-ms98-a-0031 121.540625 127.618125 that's right that's the University of Texas at Austin or Stanford or something like that so he didn't even consider those
sw2630B-ms98-a-0032 127.618125 132.245500 [silence]
sw2630B-ms98-a-0033 132.245500 133.469000 uh-huh

sw2630B-ms98-a-0037 142.478250 156.931125 he is very very strong academically yeah so we've just but you know he had to look to see what kind of environment he liked and yet he he did wind up having to make a choice he did apply to a large you know large group
sw2630B-ms98-a-0038 156.931125 158.134750 [silence]
sw2630B-ms98-a-0039 158.134750 161.419125 it's got about nine thousand undergraduate

sw2630B-ms98-a-0043 167.115250 178.637250 uh yes and it but it does have the under you know that's total undergraduate with five hundred graduate school so that the uh the college of arts and sciences is you know i guess about four thousand
sw2630B-ms98-a-0044 178.637250 180.743375 at Pennsylvania
sw2630B-ms98-a-0045 180.743375 186.404500 Williams is an undergraduate school only um and it's a total of two thousand
sw2630B-ms98-a-0046 186.404500 199.232875 yeah so he knew the feeling because my other son is at Amherst which is fifteen hundred and he had visited his brother at Amherst and knew that he liked the environment but he did go on college visits and he liked
sw2630B-ms98-a-0047 199.232875 203.058375 [silence]

sw2630B-ms98-a-0052 219.214000 221.389375 oh it's so you

sw2630B-ms98-a-0060 236.769625 245.834000 oh it's it whatever we went and he was you know impressed by the clean air and he he met the students at both schools and he liked them
sw2630B-ms98-a-0061 245.834000 252.674500 [silence]

sw2630B-ms98-a-0064 258.470875 272.404250 that's ok[ay]- the the thing is if if a person really knows very early on that they want to go in a technical field than you're not then it's probably good to go to you know to apply to a school with a strong technical program
sw2630B-ms98-a-0065 272.404250 279.777375 but uh for if you're going into if you know engineering is the thing if then you've got to at least take engineering
sw2630B-ms98-a-0066 279.777375 282.178875 that's right
sw2630B-ms98-a-0067 282.178875 286.534875 [silence]
sw2630B-ms98-a-0068 286.534875 294.377875 uh-huh no he didn't apply to any school further the furthest away was Bowdoin in Maine which is about twelve hours
sw2630B-ms98-a-0069 294.377875 296.429250 [silence]
sw2630B-ms98-a-0070 296.429250 303.433375 yeah that was the furthest and then Kenyon in Ohio which was about six and a half hours and Williams is about seven
sw2630B-ms98-a-0071 303.433375 305.220875 [silence]
sw2630B-ms98-a-0072 305.220875 316.181125 yeah so well i mean he so it wasn't he you know then the University of Pennsylvania is like two hours from here by train and then Bucknell in mid state Pennsylvania [vocalized-noise]
sw2630B-ms98-a-0073 316.181125 325.212125 yeah and he knew and [vocalized-noise] he came down i mean uh h[e]- he came he's been talking to them and and he came down and one of the things that
sw2630B-ms98-a-0074 325.212125 331.420375 he said is he went to Pennsylvania this weekend and he had an absolutely marvelous time he had a great time
sw2630B-ms98-a-0075 331.420375 337.429625 but then he said you know it was such a good time that i almost got the feeling that their emphasis is on having fun
sw2630B-ms98-a-0076 337.429625 341.039250 and he said it almost back[fired]- i think it backfired
sw2630B-ms98-a-0077 341.039250 344.219250 [silence]
sw2630B-ms98-a-0078 344.219250 345.468125 so

sw2630B-ms98-a-0080 358.963750 360.142625 um-hum

sw2630B-ms98-a-0083 364.653625 366.729750 [silence]
sw2630B-ms98-a-0084 366.729750 374.099125 of course that period too was probably difficult to for you but i did uh my advice to him and my hus[band's]- was that
sw2630B-ms98-a-0085 374.099125 385.913250 uh he had to really decide what he wanted out of college he had to look at himself uh in a larger school he had to realize that if he was going to screw around it he could probably slip
sw2630B-ms98-a-0086 385.913250 397.454000 and it wouldn't be caught up until it was too late where in a smaller school where especially in a Kenyon or a Williams where you see the professors around town all the time you skip class in the morning and they see you
sw2630B-ms98-a-0087 397.454000 399.015250 [silence]
sw2630B-ms98-a-0088 399.015250 407.916250 that's yeah yeah and a swim coach is going to be right on top of you uh so that and he will know the professors in a small
sw2630B-ms98-a-0089 407.916250 414.304125 [silence]
sw2630B-ms98-a-0090 414.304125 415.336500 uh-huh

sw2630B-ms98-a-0092 418.842500 420.398000 yeah yeah
sw2630B-ms98-a-0093 420.398000 424.597625 [silence]
sw2630B-ms98-a-0094 424.597625 431.293375 that's right that's right and um and it's just the personal contact where if you need help
sw2630B-ms98-a-0095 431.293375 444.971250 he has i told him to look to yourself are you the kind of person that will go into a large college and if the professor says i've got office hours but you really don't feel that you know him because you're in a class of a hundred that you're really going to look him up but if it's a class of fifteen
sw2630B-ms98-a-0096 444.971250 451.255125 and you need help you know that it's much easier to do it and especially in the large schools they have lectures
sw2630B-ms98-a-0097 451.255125 456.476625 and even though they may break it up into smaller groups uh Penn is known for having
sw2630B-ms98-a-0098 456.476625 461.366375 graduate assistants teaching they have graduate assistants to teach the smaller groups
sw2630B-ms98-a-0099 461.366375 465.466500 [silence]
sw2630B-ms98-a-0100 465.466500 471.485000 just a he made the decision uh i'd say about uh an hour and a half ago
sw2630B-ms98-a-0101 471.485000 482.393250 [noise] yeah i mean that's so funny i mean and and in fact he had just an hour before that two uh recent graduates from Kenyon spent close to two hours talking with him
sw2630B-ms98-a-0102 482.393250 492.606250 and uh i mean and he they were really nice and but he said is that they didn't tell him anything that he didn't know but they helped confirm his decision that a smaller school was better
sw2630B-ms98-a-0103 492.606250 493.882875 [silence]
sw2630B-ms98-a-0104 493.882875 495.718625 yeah yeah

sw2630B-ms98-a-0106 500.107500 502.018625 right now yeah
sw2630B-ms98-a-0107 502.018625 512.780250 my other son is just as happy as a bed bug he the moment he knew he he decided early on that Amherst was the school he's a classical guitarist
sw2630B-ms98-a-0108 512.780250 520.644000 and he decided he also got into the Yale graduate school of music as an undergraduate for classical guitar but he decided he was going to go to the um
sw2630B-ms98-a-0109 520.644000 524.165375 the smaller now and then graduate school later
sw2630B-ms98-a-0110 524.165375 526.784250 [silence]
sw2630B-ms98-a-0111 526.784250 531.343625 well he's really my older boy's real happy and he's minoring in English
sw2630B-ms98-a-0112 531.343625 536.774000 and he had thought about economics and he took a couple of courses in economics and decided that wasn't
sw2630B-ms98-a-0113 536.774000 542.525625 he's um he's gonna be a junior he'll be he's finishing his sophomore year so he's double majoring

sw2630B-ms98-a-0115 544.497125 556.924625 well you know see the advice we give is to not limit yourself especially this you know go to a school where you're not forced to make too many irrevocable decisions your first year or two
sw2630B-ms98-a-0116 556.924625 565.824125 [silence]

sw2630B-ms98-a-0119 569.904000 579.447375 well one of the things we said is that they should pick the college this was our advice too irrespective of the cost that somehow we would manage
sw2630B-ms98-a-0120 579.447375 584.207625 well we place a real high priority on education in our family
sw2630B-ms98-a-0121 584.207625 587.430000 [silence]
