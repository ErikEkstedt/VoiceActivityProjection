sw2630A-ms98-a-0045 138.981125 142.788750 sounds like your son has academically the standing to get into that type of school
sw2630A-ms98-a-0046 142.788750 148.486500 [silence]

sw2630A-ms98-a-0064 211.947125 224.875250 yeah that is too much and i mean i um i can only say it's strange your son picked those kinds of college because i spent a year at Bennington in Vermont um and that was this was twenty years [laughter-ago] showing my age um
sw2630A-ms98-a-0065 224.875250 225.958625 [silence]

sw2630A-ms98-a-0070 245.249000 260.144000 well you know um my husband's an engineer and a strong liber[al]- a strong liberal arts background with uh a graduate degree in a technical field will get him much further than say like a a strong um business administration degree than with another MBA on top of it

sw2630A-ms98-a-0075 269.449000 271.476500 yeah but they usually don't

sw2630A-ms98-a-0077 278.776875 287.894250 right but they no but who does i mean i think i think all i think the majority of people just don't know no he looked at criteria such as location size of school yeah
sw2630A-ms98-a-0078 287.894250 293.756000 [silence]
sw2630A-ms98-a-0079 293.756000 297.334750 that's still pretty far though i mean a lot of kids just don't even want to go
sw2630A-ms98-a-0080 297.334750 303.619375 [silence]
sw2630A-ms98-a-0081 303.619375 305.939000 oh that's not too bad
sw2630A-ms98-a-0082 305.939000 313.189375 [silence]
sw2630A-ms98-a-0083 313.189375 318.787375 [vocalized-noise] yeah he will enjoy Williams i think and that's the truth is it's a good academic
sw2630A-ms98-a-0084 318.787375 322.885375 [silence]
sw2630A-ms98-a-0085 322.885375 324.695375 [laughter]

sw2630A-ms98-a-0089 336.662625 340.111500 that could very well be i mean
sw2630A-ms98-a-0090 340.111500 353.469500 so he's developing his his uh internal instincts right now that's good because i mean i'm sure what he said was true that uh you well actually that's one of the reasons i went to uh Kenyon he we[nt]- he made a good choice i went i
sw2630A-ms98-a-0091 353.469500 364.029875 well i sh[ould]- we're not supposed to but i spent a year in Vermont my freshman year it was just too far away it was too different uh the level of income of lot of the students and their attitudes was just um beyond my 
sw2630A-ms98-a-0092 364.029875 367.610500 um in terms of drugs et cetera which i thought was shocking
sw2630A-ms98-a-0093 367.610500 370.791125 right yeah you're right but then i went to
sw2630A-ms98-a-0094 370.791125 371.664625 [silence]
sw2630A-ms98-a-0095 371.664625 372.772625 yeah

sw2630A-ms98-a-0099 396.910000 400.912125 and you're going to get a little bit more input [laughter] than discipline yeah
sw2630A-ms98-a-0100 400.912125 406.465250 [silence]
sw2630A-ms98-a-0101 406.465250 419.664125 well i don't know how to put this either in this way and then it doesn't sound like your sons would need this but i just think the other thing is with the way a lot of the youth is today i think the refinement that they get i don't mean specifically etiquette or culture but just what you're saying just a solid background
sw2630A-ms98-a-0102 419.664125 425.484750 because i just don't think at that age i just don't think that young people know what they want to do
sw2630A-ms98-a-0103 425.484750 427.212625 you know and um
sw2630A-ms98-a-0104 427.212625 430.797750 [silence]

sw2630A-ms98-a-0113 459.681250 460.960000 [silence]
sw2630A-ms98-a-0114 460.960000 466.788000 this is true and i mean that is very ironic too that your son just made the did he just make the decision today
sw2630A-ms98-a-0115 466.788000 470.500500 [silence]
sw2630A-ms98-a-0116 470.500500 472.422000 how funny [laughter]
sw2630A-ms98-a-0117 472.422000 473.660875 well he'll
sw2630A-ms98-a-0118 473.660875 481.674875 [silence]
sw2630A-ms98-a-0119 481.674875 483.872875 that's funny
sw2630A-ms98-a-0120 483.872875 491.227500 [silence]
sw2630A-ms98-a-0121 491.227500 504.566375 it was easy for him to rule out he knew what he didn't want that's exactly yeah now is your other i mean we're talking a lot about what you think but obviously you're experiencing it uh did your other son um
sw2630A-ms98-a-0122 504.566375 506.375000 a clam
sw2630A-ms98-a-0123 506.375000 512.316250 [silence]
sw2630A-ms98-a-0124 512.316250 513.558875 oh wonderful
sw2630A-ms98-a-0125 513.558875 517.230000 [silence]
sw2630A-ms98-a-0126 517.230000 518.168000 uh-huh

sw2630A-ms98-a-0130 523.506000 528.190000 and they'll do fine in their studies and i'm sure they'll go on to graduate school and
sw2630A-ms98-a-0131 528.190000 535.110375 [silence]
sw2630A-ms98-a-0132 535.110375 538.284875 and now he's a sen[ior]- he's a senior or is this early admissions
sw2630A-ms98-a-0133 538.284875 540.756500 [silence]
sw2630A-ms98-a-0134 540.756500 541.915750 so he's
sw2630A-ms98-a-0135 541.915750 544.924000 so he's yeah well sounds like you have two talented sons
sw2630A-ms98-a-0136 544.924000 555.813125 [silence]
sw2630A-ms98-a-0137 555.813125 566.178250 i think and a lot of people talk about and it's not the economics i'm solely zeroed in on but i think a lot of people think a lot of people think about the tuition level and what exactly are you getting in return
sw2630A-ms98-a-0138 566.178250 572.384125 and i think that a lot of people shy away from the smaller coll[eges]- colleges because of that and i i think it's rather sad 
sw2630A-ms98-a-0139 572.384125 578.133500 [silence]
sw2630A-ms98-a-0140 578.133500 582.425375 you are wonderful parents [laughter]
sw2630A-ms98-a-0141 582.425375 590.357125 no and i agree i mean my husband and i in fact i'm taking my LSATs um i'm thirty something and taking my LSATs on June tenth
sw2630A-ms98-a-0142 590.357125 597.140375 um the point being and your sons will learn this from you i'm sure that uh no matter what age you are you can learn
sw2630A-ms98-a-0143 597.140375 599.550750 and it sounds like they're going to you know they're just
