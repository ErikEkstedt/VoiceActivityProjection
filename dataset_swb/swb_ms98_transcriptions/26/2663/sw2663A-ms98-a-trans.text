sw2663A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.670250 i just pressed my uh
sw2663A-ms98-a-0002 1.670250 3.956500 [silence]
sw2663A-ms98-a-0003 3.956500 11.202250 i got one that's interesting not too c[ontroversial]- not too controversial i you know not doesn't matter whether you're Democrat or Republican i- i do get somewhat of a kick out of
sw2663A-ms98-a-0004 11.202250 25.173500 because Schwartzkopf or the other generals who i admire how everyone wants to make get them in politics i think that's kind of an interesting recent thing that that i could think of recently that uh i was wondering what you thought about that making the generals uh
sw2663A-ms98-a-0005 25.173500 27.446625 getting a general into politics
sw2663A-ms98-a-0006 27.446625 30.554375 [silence]
sw2663A-ms98-a-0007 30.554375 43.302375 right although i've i've been thinking about it and i uh i kind of get a kick out of they always want the hero those we're looking for a hero although Time magazine was saying that uh in essence the the general's staff
sw2663A-ms98-a-0008 43.302375 52.579875 was comparing to corporate presidents and they said that in general generals are more familiar with training that they believe in training more
sw2663A-ms98-a-0009 52.579875 66.156250 they are much more educated than the average corporate president and so the really were very positive on a general's staff person having a a very much better education than the average uh corporate president so i thought well maybe
sw2663A-ms98-a-0010 66.156250 67.900500 [silence]
sw2663A-ms98-a-0011 67.900500 78.893500 well that too that too and uh you know they talk about the Army and because of the war and why did we win and all that and they talked about how the training was so important and that's so important in industry so
sw2663A-ms98-a-0012 78.893500 88.710875 you know they're liable to be right that that generals generals in the service and Schwartzkopf uh you know might make a good uh politician whether it be Governor or whatever you know
sw2663A-ms98-a-0013 88.710875 106.901750 [silence]
sw2663A-ms98-a-0014 106.901750 114.069500 yeah it's interesting how they say that when they're usually the top dogs you know that the everyone has a boss of course uh
sw2663A-ms98-a-0015 114.069500 117.506250 [silence]
sw2663A-ms98-a-0016 117.506250 118.901250 yeah
sw2663A-ms98-a-0017 118.901250 124.649625 [silence]
sw2663A-ms98-a-0018 124.649625 126.969875 no that's true that's true
sw2663A-ms98-a-0019 126.969875 134.166250 uh you you you pick one i- i- just i just thought of that one when when they brought up about politics that was uh pretty easy
sw2663A-ms98-a-0020 134.166250 138.600250 uh you don't have to pick Democratic or Republican you can pick anything you want go ahead
sw2663A-ms98-a-0021 138.600250 161.120250 [silence]
sw2663A-ms98-a-0022 161.120250 164.213375 well i have an easy answer for that oh i wish they would do it is that limit it you know to uh eight or ten years max you know whether that's two two uh five year terms or whatever 
sw2663A-ms98-a-0023 164.213375 170.573125 [silence]
sw2663A-ms98-a-0024 170.573125 172.432750 oh you know you're not

sw2663A-ms98-a-0031 211.726125 213.177125 [silence]
sw2663A-ms98-a-0032 213.177125 219.387625 yeah i don't know i do like the the limitation of the President and uh i think there is a needed change i
sw2663A-ms98-a-0033 219.387625 228.669625 i- i think the same thing should happen for Congress uh i'd like you know that would be my answer of an easy way to to get these guys out of there for twenty years my God it's ridiculous you know
sw2663A-ms98-a-0034 228.669625 236.255750 [silence]
sw2663A-ms98-a-0035 236.255750 237.627500 we had
sw2663A-ms98-a-0036 237.627500 243.067875 [silence]
sw2663A-ms98-a-0037 243.067875 257.175625 i think voting is a prob[lem]- i think i had one of the subject about voting and uh voting apathy or something like that and i think that uh the voting rules need to be changed where you have a little more time i- i can't believe that a country our big
sw2663A-ms98-a-0038 257.175625 269.302875 votes for a President from seven o'clock in the morning till seven o'clock at night you know of course they have absentee which is getting to be more a lot easier and i- i vote as often on absentee as i can because it's so easy now but
sw2663A-ms98-a-0039 269.302875 278.227875 i think gee whiz you could make it a couple days uh it's just uh if you really want the majority of the people to vote then give them_1 a couple of days
sw2663A-ms98-a-0040 278.227875 285.533375 [silence]

sw2663A-ms98-a-0051 337.163500 345.350875 it's so awful that uh politicians always spent consulting money that we put them_1 in office and then they go out and spend a couple hundreds of thousands of dollars
sw2663A-ms98-a-0052 345.350875 352.930500 to buy consultants and then they don't even do that recommendation you know i mean it's amazing the money that they spend once they get in

sw2663A-ms98-a-0056 369.698625 374.522000 yeah it is uh uh hopefully people will get more involved uh
sw2663A-ms98-a-0057 374.522000 376.656375 [silence]
sw2663A-ms98-a-0058 376.656375 382.489000 oh yeah but but those are the ones that are complaining i- i think a lot i see it here at TI

sw2663A-ms98-a-0065 399.109375 403.146875 i think they could do more about uh voting
sw2663A-ms98-a-0066 403.146875 411.796750 what are the issues i i'm a Democrat i want to just say that i'm so sad that there isn't a strong Democrat i don't even know i could i could go out and
sw2663A-ms98-a-0067 411.796750 420.175875 and debate George Bush better than i see any Democrat doing it you know i mean at least i'd like to see compe[tition]- because i like competition you know
sw2663A-ms98-a-0068 420.175875 427.055125 and i think rolling over and put your belly up and play dead i'm so disgusted with the Democratic party i can not believe it you know

sw2663A-ms98-a-0072 439.807625 447.199875 i don't know whether they're recent events i guess they we[re]- on this uh speech thing they want us to use a variety of words you know
