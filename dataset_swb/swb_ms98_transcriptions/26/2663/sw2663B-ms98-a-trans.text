sw2663B-ms98-a-0007 24.399500 27.039250 um-hum
sw2663B-ms98-a-0008 27.039250 30.971625 they want him because he's popular not because he can do the job
sw2663B-ms98-a-0009 30.971625 35.953625 [silence]
sw2663B-ms98-a-0010 35.953625 37.373125 yeah

sw2663B-ms98-a-0015 61.416000 64.163500 [silence]
sw2663B-ms98-a-0016 64.163500 68.511125 i- i think they probably have a better education than the average congressman
sw2663B-ms98-a-0017 68.511125 78.892375 [silence]
sw2663B-ms98-a-0018 78.892375 79.979000 um-hum

sw2663B-ms98-a-0020 86.340000 87.688000 yeah
sw2663B-ms98-a-0021 87.688000 97.169375 he he you know we know he's a good leader we know he's a good organizer the question is you know can he be the man who's ultimately responsible you know like what he said is
sw2663B-ms98-a-0022 97.169375 109.237250 you know a lot of times in his interviews he was talking about you know people asking why are you doing this why are you doing that he says i'm following the orders of my President i'm not the one who writes the orders i'm just the one who follows them
sw2663B-ms98-a-0023 109.237250 112.852375 um-hum
sw2663B-ms98-a-0024 112.852375 118.096000 well you know Schwartzkopf was ordered to get Iraq out of Kuwait
sw2663B-ms98-a-0025 118.096000 125.761000 and so he went to the President and said okay here's how i want to do it but uh he wasn't the one that decided that Iraq needed to get out of Kuwait
sw2663B-ms98-a-0026 125.761000 127.240750 uh-huh
sw2663B-ms98-a-0027 127.240750 133.415125 [laughter]
sw2663B-ms98-a-0028 133.415125 134.700875 yeah
sw2663B-ms98-a-0029 134.700875 137.880625 [silence]
sw2663B-ms98-a-0030 137.880625 149.240500 well the the thing that i'm wondering about is how we get a new congress how do we get some of these guys that have been in there for so long how do we get them_1
sw2663B-ms98-a-0031 149.240500 152.434500 to not get reelected over and over again
sw2663B-ms98-a-0032 152.434500 158.698375 [silence]
sw2663B-ms98-a-0033 158.698375 159.758250 yeah
sw2663B-ms98-a-0034 159.758250 161.435625 [silence]
sw2663B-ms98-a-0035 161.435625 162.426625 i th[ink]-
sw2663B-ms98-a-0036 162.426625 163.631000 yeah
sw2663B-ms98-a-0037 163.631000 167.034750 that may be our only answer but i don't really like it
sw2663B-ms98-a-0038 167.034750 170.941500 i don't like the fact that the President is limited in the number of terms he can serve
sw2663B-ms98-a-0039 170.941500 177.642000 because i think if the President be him Republican or Democrat i think if the President can prove
sw2663B-ms98-a-0040 177.642000 190.288375 that he's popular you know that he can do the job then the people should be allowed to elect him as often as they want i think the reason why we've got these guys in congress is because of the fund-raising rules i mean
sw2663B-ms98-a-0041 190.288375 201.815500 how many of these big campaign contributions that they're running on this year did they get after they were elected just you know just after they were elected two years ago
sw2663B-ms98-a-0042 201.815500 213.694500 basically the people as soon as they get elected the people dump all kinds of money on them_1 and say yeah yeah you're my friend you're my friend and two years later he remembers that so what they've done is bought this congressman for two years
sw2663B-ms98-a-0043 213.694500 223.436750 [silence]
sw2663B-ms98-a-0044 223.436750 224.855375 yeah well
sw2663B-ms98-a-0045 224.855375 227.573625 um-hum
sw2663B-ms98-a-0046 227.573625 236.500875 that's that's the easy way i think the harder way out would be to make the uh the guys that are in there and the guys who are trying to get in there run on more level ground
sw2663B-ms98-a-0047 236.500875 243.484250 and that's that's what the financing rules and the uh the mailing rules and the size of the office staff and all that stuff
sw2663B-ms98-a-0048 243.484250 261.007500 [silence]
sw2663B-ms98-a-0049 261.007500 262.091375 yeah

sw2663B-ms98-a-0054 276.662000 278.079875 [silence]
sw2663B-ms98-a-0055 278.079875 282.496500 well i think a lot more people could vote if
sw2663B-ms98-a-0056 282.496500 286.913000 they were somehow persuaded that it's something worth caring about
sw2663B-ms98-a-0057 286.913000 296.144875 you know like you know the the recent uh election about how the Dallas City Council should be made up that election last December
sw2663B-ms98-a-0058 296.144875 298.474250 i'm in yeah i'm in Dallas city limit
sw2663B-ms98-a-0059 298.474250 301.029375 um-hum
sw2663B-ms98-a-0060 301.029375 302.363375 yes
sw2663B-ms98-a-0061 302.363375 304.226500 it's an ugly mess
sw2663B-ms98-a-0062 304.226500 306.163875 um-hum
sw2663B-ms98-a-0063 306.163875 306.939250 [silence]

sw2663B-ms98-a-0065 308.072375 315.067750 [silence]
sw2663B-ms98-a-0066 315.067750 316.425500 the manager
sw2663B-ms98-a-0067 316.425500 317.969250 yeah
sw2663B-ms98-a-0068 317.969250 326.455625 i don't yeah well what get's me you know this thing it went down to defeat last December by how many votes by just a few hundred votes
sw2663B-ms98-a-0069 326.455625 338.025125 and if if it had passed if these people had gotten out the vote it would have passed and there'd be no more argument but they're still fighting about it because of the way that election went last December
sw2663B-ms98-a-0070 338.025125 340.951000 [silence]
sw2663B-ms98-a-0071 340.951000 342.641375 um-hum
sw2663B-ms98-a-0072 342.641375 345.432750 [silence]
sw2663B-ms98-a-0073 345.432750 346.799125 yeah
sw2663B-ms98-a-0074 346.799125 347.823875 [silence]
sw2663B-ms98-a-0075 347.823875 349.003875 um-hum
sw2663B-ms98-a-0076 349.003875 351.608125 um-hum yeah
sw2663B-ms98-a-0077 351.608125 361.396875 but but this was for supposedly to benefit the minorities and all the minorities had to do was go out and get a couple more hundred people to vote and they would have had their way
sw2663B-ms98-a-0078 361.396875 368.580625 [silence]
sw2663B-ms98-a-0079 368.580625 370.804375 yeah it's pretty sad
sw2663B-ms98-a-0080 370.804375 373.206625 um-hum
sw2663B-ms98-a-0081 373.206625 378.402375 uh my my position is people who don't vote don't have any right to complain about the way the government's going
sw2663B-ms98-a-0082 378.402375 379.248750 [silence]
sw2663B-ms98-a-0083 379.248750 380.412500 yeah

sw2663B-ms98-a-0086 387.626125 392.625125 and and you ask them_1 why they don't vote they say well they don't want their name on the uh jury duty list
sw2663B-ms98-a-0087 392.625125 393.731500 [silence]
sw2663B-ms98-a-0088 393.731500 398.359000 they that that's where they get the jury duty list is from the voter registration list
sw2663B-ms98-a-0089 398.359000 402.399000 [vocalized-noise]
sw2663B-ms98-a-0090 402.399000 403.905250 i think they could

sw2663B-ms98-a-0096 425.095250 431.689375 in Presidential races that's about what they've done but they've got a pretty good lock on Congress and a lot of local things
