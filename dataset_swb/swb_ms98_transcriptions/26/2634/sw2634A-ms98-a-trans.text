sw2634A-ms98-a-0002 1.273125 9.236375 well um i'm uh pretty pro gun control over all i am
sw2634A-ms98-a-0003 9.236375 15.970750 [noise] have had a lot of arguments with people about the issue of gun control and uh
sw2634A-ms98-a-0004 15.970750 26.725125 i must say that there are a couple of arguments against uh strong gun control which i find very compelling although most of the people who argue gun control with me i find um
sw2634A-ms98-a-0005 26.725125 32.997250 use sort of canned arguments you know sort of the NRA slogan arguments and um
sw2634A-ms98-a-0006 32.997250 37.476750 uh so i've been very frustrated when i do debate with people about it
sw2634A-ms98-a-0007 37.476750 42.300125 um i guess on a o[ne]- a [laughter-scale] of one to ten i'm probably around a two [laughter] 
sw2634A-ms98-a-0008 42.300125 52.986000 in terms of fair restricting guns and i have to admit most of that is uh strong personal distaste i don't like the idea of people being able to kill me with very very little effort
sw2634A-ms98-a-0009 52.986000 58.699250 um and uh guns are very symbolic of them having that power over me

sw2634A-ms98-a-0052 288.415500 296.472875 well that makes a lot of since to me i mean i certainly feel that if if we may disagree on when someone should own a fire arm but uh
sw2634A-ms98-a-0053 296.472875 305.713625 i certainly agree that if someone owns a fire arm they have as much responsibility to know how to do use it safely as someone learns how to drive if not more so

sw2634A-ms98-a-0056 317.765500 326.189250 well i'm still i'm still puzzled though what is the argument how does the argument work if uh if the bad guys are going to have guns anyway
sw2634A-ms98-a-0057 326.189250 339.453500 what's the point of putting a restriction basically the restrictions are just to penalize the good guys because_1 the bad guys are going to get the guns anyway they're not going to take those courses is it uh is it a way of raising the prices of illegal guns
sw2634A-ms98-a-0058 339.453500 342.278500 [silence]
sw2634A-ms98-a-0059 342.278500 348.705500 if it's not going to cut the supply of illegal guns it must going to at least raise the prices is that uh main advantage

sw2634A-ms98-a-0082 448.283750 456.221875 um i'm quite concerned that if you let everyone who hasn't yet used a gun in a f[elony]- uh haven't hasn't yet committed a felony
sw2634A-ms98-a-0083 456.221875 467.707125 if you let them all walk around carrying guns in this sort of wild west scenario you're going to get an awful lot of people shooting guns pretty quickly just given human nature you're going to start getting a lot of gunfire
sw2634A-ms98-a-0084 467.707125 478.457000 it's it's hard for me to imagine that a a situation of you know take it to it's logical extreme if everyone walking around carrying guns you're not going to have an increase in gunfire
