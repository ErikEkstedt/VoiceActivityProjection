sw2674B-ms98-a-0003 16.679000 17.741625 that's true
sw2674B-ms98-a-0004 17.741625 33.171375 [silence]
sw2674B-ms98-a-0005 33.171375 35.622500 do they have a law on the books up there
sw2674B-ms98-a-0006 35.622500 48.653125 [silence]
sw2674B-ms98-a-0007 48.653125 49.752375 right 
sw2674B-ms98-a-0008 49.752375 54.369125 [silence]
sw2674B-ms98-a-0009 54.369125 56.729500 [noise] so what's your uh opinion on capital punishment
sw2674B-ms98-a-0010 56.729500 60.220125 [silence]
sw2674B-ms98-a-0011 60.220125 61.589875 yes uh
sw2674B-ms98-a-0012 61.589875 62.409375 [noise]
sw2674B-ms98-a-0013 62.409375 63.618375 there's
sw2674B-ms98-a-0014 63.618375 66.703125 you know there are some things just that just are inexcusable
sw2674B-ms98-a-0015 66.703125 67.797625 [silence]
sw2674B-ms98-a-0016 67.797625 69.181375 brutal crimes
sw2674B-ms98-a-0017 69.181375 72.394625 ser[ial]- ser[ial]- serial crimes things like that
sw2674B-ms98-a-0018 72.394625 73.782625 [silence]
sw2674B-ms98-a-0019 73.782625 76.924125 um you know to me the punishment
sw2674B-ms98-a-0020 76.924125 80.284250 doesn't even fit the crime but you can't get any worse
sw2674B-ms98-a-0021 80.284250 121.755875 [silence]
sw2674B-ms98-a-0022 121.755875 129.503000 right i think in a way it's unfortunate they've come up with with nice ways to
sw2674B-ms98-a-0023 129.503000 135.185750 um execute people i guess to me if if i was a uh
sw2674B-ms98-a-0024 135.185750 145.635875 potential serial killer or something it wouldn't stop me to be uh to die of lethal injection i mean it's as painless as you can go
sw2674B-ms98-a-0025 145.635875 146.173500 [silence]
sw2674B-ms98-a-0026 146.173500 155.263500 i mean i think if i was in a bad accident and they gave me the option i might say yeah you know give me an injection but uh
sw2674B-ms98-a-0027 155.263500 167.397250 [laughter] i don't know about that um but uh you know the electric chair on the other hand is probably a pretty painful way to go i don't know
sw2674B-ms98-a-0028 167.397250 170.750250 i don't know personally i'll never be in that position
sw2674B-ms98-a-0029 170.750250 173.526500 [silence]
sw2674B-ms98-a-0030 173.526500 177.588625 so but i don't i think it should be something that is
sw2674B-ms98-a-0031 177.588625 180.558500 that is a deterrent that's something that that
sw2674B-ms98-a-0032 180.558500 182.030125 [silence]
sw2674B-ms98-a-0033 182.030125 183.238500 that's
sw2674B-ms98-a-0034 183.238500 188.700750 scary and it's something that's going to make you make you be afraid to uh afraid of the consequences
sw2674B-ms98-a-0035 188.700750 205.171625 [silence]
sw2674B-ms98-a-0036 205.171625 208.624750 depends on the nature of the abuse and i really don't uh
sw2674B-ms98-a-0037 208.624750 215.722375 you know that that's it's something that's got to be evaluated on an individual case you know because
sw2674B-ms98-a-0038 215.722375 219.483625 there's there's really no excuse for abuse but then
sw2674B-ms98-a-0039 219.483625 222.275375 there are other options there are ways to get out
sw2674B-ms98-a-0040 222.275375 223.860000 [silence]
sw2674B-ms98-a-0041 223.860000 227.090000 yeah i mean there
sw2674B-ms98-a-0042 227.090000 230.296375 you would hope but i guess it's really a
sw2674B-ms98-a-0043 230.296375 235.456250 it's easy to say but uh you'd hope that someone in that situation would
sw2674B-ms98-a-0044 235.456250 238.337250 you know get out there are enough support groups enough
sw2674B-ms98-a-0045 238.337250 239.344000 [silence]
sw2674B-ms98-a-0046 239.344000 243.717875 you know over the c[entury]- over the last decade or so anyway there's been
sw2674B-ms98-a-0047 243.717875 247.520750 you know you don't have to kill your uh kill your husband because he's
sw2674B-ms98-a-0048 247.520750 248.675375 [silence]
sw2674B-ms98-a-0049 248.675375 254.100125 beating you up all the time you can can leave and have support it's not like you'd be stuck on the streets
sw2674B-ms98-a-0050 254.100125 294.017000 [silence]
sw2674B-ms98-a-0051 294.017000 296.212625 this is almost as much of a crime and i guess
sw2674B-ms98-a-0052 296.212625 298.559250 and i guess
sw2674B-ms98-a-0053 298.559250 300.453375 [silence]
sw2674B-ms98-a-0054 300.453375 303.980000 i don't know it's to me it's almost as much of a crime to just let it go
sw2674B-ms98-a-0055 303.980000 306.515875 [silence]
sw2674B-ms98-a-0056 306.515875 318.259625 and i think i guess it gets back to if if if a woman kills her husband because he's been brutalizing her or her children there's maybe more of a reason and it's not an irrational
sw2674B-ms98-a-0057 318.259625 321.041125 you know just a brutal crime for the sake of
sw2674B-ms98-a-0058 321.041125 323.312125 [silence]
sw2674B-ms98-a-0059 323.312125 326.836000 just i don't know without a conscience or something like like some of these
sw2674B-ms98-a-0060 326.836000 327.820000 [silence]
sw2674B-ms98-a-0061 327.820000 331.519375 that's kind of what i think what capital punishment should be for is you know somebody that's just
sw2674B-ms98-a-0062 331.519375 332.713000 [silence]
sw2674B-ms98-a-0063 332.713000 336.145875 you know missing something upstairs or just goes out and
sw2674B-ms98-a-0064 336.145875 339.086875 you know rapes and brutalizes a woman and
sw2674B-ms98-a-0065 339.086875 341.041500 turns around and does it again 
sw2674B-ms98-a-0066 341.041500 341.870750 [silence]
sw2674B-ms98-a-0067 341.870750 344.176625 and it's like there's just no excuse you
sw2674B-ms98-a-0068 344.176625 348.961000 there's no reason i should pay for this person to spend the rest of his life in in prison
sw2674B-ms98-a-0069 348.961000 353.267250 [silence]
sw2674B-ms98-a-0070 353.267250 364.200000 no but i don't think uh i don't think it's right for somebody to uh for me to to uh pay for something i mean the w[ay]- the way it is right now the prisons are overcrowded
sw2674B-ms98-a-0071 364.200000 364.832500 [silence]
sw2674B-ms98-a-0072 364.832500 368.859750 and we're giving people that aren't going to change
sw2674B-ms98-a-0073 368.859750 371.160625 we're just we're just housing them until they die
sw2674B-ms98-a-0074 371.160625 372.040000 [silence]
sw2674B-ms98-a-0075 372.040000 382.280000 and if they've you know caused as much pain and suffering as they have for for no reason and they're going to do it again if they get the chance
sw2674B-ms98-a-0076 382.280000 383.954500 [silence]
sw2674B-ms98-a-0077 383.954500 386.273000 it j[ust]- just doesn't seem uh
sw2674B-ms98-a-0078 386.273000 425.701625 [silence]
sw2674B-ms98-a-0079 425.701625 426.386375 right 
sw2674B-ms98-a-0080 426.386375 452.623500 [silence]
sw2674B-ms98-a-0081 452.623500 457.149250 uh it's just like uh back in California the Charles Manson thing
sw2674B-ms98-a-0082 457.149250 457.940000 [silence]
sw2674B-ms98-a-0083 457.940000 462.458750 and of course he'll never i don't think he'll ever get out on parole just because it was so well publicized
sw2674B-ms98-a-0084 462.458750 463.096375 [silence] 
sw2674B-ms98-a-0085 463.096375 465.840000 but uh you know he comes up every so often
sw2674B-ms98-a-0086 465.840000 469.019500 [silence]
sw2674B-ms98-a-0087 469.019500 469.987000 right

sw2674B-ms98-a-0089 475.044125 478.582250 maybe they ought to have an island out in the middle of the ocean we can drop them all off
sw2674B-ms98-a-0090 478.582250 481.340000 [silence]
sw2674B-ms98-a-0091 481.340000 483.800500 yeah [laughter] Australia might not care for that these days
sw2674B-ms98-a-0092 483.800500 487.270000 [silence]
sw2674B-ms98-a-0093 487.270000 490.353875 on an island so far away there's no chance they can ever get off
sw2674B-ms98-a-0094 490.353875 493.017375 [silence]
sw2674B-ms98-a-0095 493.017375 493.631375 yes
