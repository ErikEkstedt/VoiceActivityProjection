sw2609A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.430250 [noise]
sw2609A-ms98-a-0002 1.430250 15.339875 well do you think uh i mean i wonder the assumption is that it is a problem uh and i've never actually had too many people explain to me why it's a problem though i have the same instinctual feeling that it's a problem
sw2609A-ms98-a-0003 15.339875 19.379250 and uh but it's not clear to me that it is
sw2609A-ms98-a-0004 19.379250 32.815875 um it's a problem if those voting don't represent the population demographically or in terms of their opinions but if those who don't vote if you made them vote and it those who don't vote would have voted exactly the same way
sw2609A-ms98-a-0005 32.815875 41.614875 you know in other words if forty percent had voted for that person and sixty percent for the other just like everyone who did vote it's not clear to me that it is really a problem
sw2609A-ms98-a-0006 41.614875 49.375250 [silence]
sw2609A-ms98-a-0007 49.375250 50.560125 um-hum
sw2609A-ms98-a-0008 50.560125 53.534500 [silence]
sw2609A-ms98-a-0009 53.534500 64.400625 i mean i i assume that those who don't vote i mean if you look at the break down of those who don't vote they tend to be you know poor blacks for example vote very little and things like that and i assume that they would vote differently
sw2609A-ms98-a-0010 64.400625 72.046500 if they were voting than your average voter but i don't know if that's the case in fact i've heard of studies that suggest that that isn't
sw2609A-ms98-a-0011 72.046500 75.000625 [vocalized-noise]
sw2609A-ms98-a-0012 75.000625 85.690125 uh i guess not i'm i'm i vote religiously i really do [laughter] um i guess i guess i'm a fan of democracy and uh [noise] wish i could vote on more things frankly
sw2609A-ms98-a-0013 85.690125 88.429500 [silence]
sw2609A-ms98-a-0014 88.429500 99.396375 but it's funny because here in California things are getting uh increasingly democratically oriented in in the sense of people being able to vote for things i mean we have these initiatives state initiatives now
sw2609A-ms98-a-0015 99.396375 108.668125 the first really popular you know wide spread one was uh Proposition Thirteen which was a uh tax revolt against property taxes uh
sw2609A-ms98-a-0016 108.668125 117.205375 and you know now we're and that was whatever ten years ago and now we're up to Proposition Hundred and fifty or something like that i mean we've [laughter-just] 
sw2609A-ms98-a-0017 117.205375 123.471500 there were apparently voters who just threw up their hands after the last voters pamphlet because they were asked being asked to make decisions
sw2609A-ms98-a-0018 123.471500 126.500625 on topics that would have three different competing
sw2609A-ms98-a-0019 126.500625 134.452250 proposals and you had to vote for you know yes or no on each of them and no one could make heads or tails out of some of them and it was incredibly complicated and difficult
sw2609A-ms98-a-0020 134.452250 144.026000 and a lot of people revolted against that they said we don't want to have to decide all these things yeah that's that's that's why we hire people who uh you know to to make these decisions for us
sw2609A-ms98-a-0021 144.026000 145.530375 [silence]
sw2609A-ms98-a-0022 145.530375 146.590625 yeah
sw2609A-ms98-a-0023 146.590625 149.387375 [silence]
sw2609A-ms98-a-0024 149.387375 150.540750 i do too
sw2609A-ms98-a-0025 150.540750 154.793500 [silence]
sw2609A-ms98-a-0026 154.793500 165.443000 uh-huh uh-huh yeah i wouldn't mind having oh more votes than i get to have frankly [laughter] anyone who doesn't vote it's fine with me as long as i can have their [laughter-vote]
sw2609A-ms98-a-0027 165.443000 173.043000 [laughter] that would make me happy though maybe not in a in a deep philosophical sense but in a selfish sense it probably would
sw2609A-ms98-a-0028 173.043000 181.394375 i don't know it's interesting uh some countries voting is obligatory uh it is in Australia for example yeah
sw2609A-ms98-a-0029 181.394375 182.443625 yeah
sw2609A-ms98-a-0030 182.443625 184.401375 [silence]
sw2609A-ms98-a-0031 184.401375 187.271875 i don't know how i feel about that [laughter]
sw2609A-ms98-a-0032 187.271875 189.856875 [silence]
sw2609A-ms98-a-0033 189.856875 203.886125 well Australia considers itself every bit as much a democracy as the United States and it's not for me to say that they're not um they they feel i mean here you have the right to vote and they simply define it as a duty there
sw2609A-ms98-a-0034 203.886125 207.340125 you know we have just as we have a r[ight]- a duty to pay taxes
sw2609A-ms98-a-0035 207.340125 218.199625 you know is that democratic i mean we don't have the right to pay taxes in this country we have the duty to pay taxes and in that country it's a duty to pay taxes and it's a duty to vote on how those taxes are spent
sw2609A-ms98-a-0036 218.199625 222.617625 and it's not clear to me that that's so much less democratic
sw2609A-ms98-a-0037 222.617625 223.907125 um
sw2609A-ms98-a-0038 223.907125 228.206500 i don't know but part of me rebels against that but then i'm an American [laughter]
sw2609A-ms98-a-0039 228.206500 229.805250 [laughter]
sw2609A-ms98-a-0040 229.805250 230.682125 yeah
sw2609A-ms98-a-0041 230.682125 240.677625 yeah and some people don't vote i mean there is like three or four percent of Australians don't vote and i think they're el[igible]- eligible for a fine i don't know if they actually are fined or or what happens
sw2609A-ms98-a-0042 240.677625 243.582000 but you're eligible for some sort of fine if you don't vote
sw2609A-ms98-a-0043 243.582000 248.263625 [silence]
sw2609A-ms98-a-0044 248.263625 249.328625 uh-huh
sw2609A-ms98-a-0045 249.328625 255.234125 [silence]
sw2609A-ms98-a-0046 255.234125 256.989375 yeah i sort of see uh
sw2609A-ms98-a-0047 256.989375 265.973125 well i that's how i feel i mean if you if you vote and your guy looses well you leas[t]- you least tried and you can say something but if you don't vote i sort of feel like
sw2609A-ms98-a-0048 265.973125 278.663875 part of me and it's kind of a nasty part of me feels like well if you didn't vote you get what's coming to you you know and certainly that's true in the overall i mean no one individual that's true for but for the population as a whole i sort of feel that way
sw2609A-ms98-a-0049 278.663875 283.630500 when they especially when someone they [noise] they don't vote for someone because
sw2609A-ms98-a-0050 283.630500 292.838625 they don't like any of them and then the person gets in and they don't like him and he turns out to have been worse than her that they might have voted for or something like that and you know i say well
sw2609A-ms98-a-0051 292.838625 295.719500 you know voting for the lesser of two evils is still important
sw2609A-ms98-a-0052 295.719500 297.752000 [noise]
sw2609A-ms98-a-0053 297.752000 300.697000 [silence]
sw2609A-ms98-a-0054 300.697000 302.765125 yeah yeah i mean you [laughter]
sw2609A-ms98-a-0055 302.765125 310.328250 i mean it's it's funny because technically you do i mean you have the right to do a write in candidate but of course that's that's not really a vote
sw2609A-ms98-a-0056 310.328250 312.063375 um
sw2609A-ms98-a-0057 312.063375 315.432625 yes it rea[lly]- really doesn't and
sw2609A-ms98-a-0058 315.432625 320.626000 so it's it's a complicated situation but i would like to see i don't know i i
sw2609A-ms98-a-0059 320.626000 333.935625 i'm i'm thinking of actually moving to Australia and and perha[ps]- perhaps i'll call you back and let you know what how the Australian system works i mean not because of the vo[te]- i mean i'm not thinking of moving there because of the voting but just because of a job opportunity and uh i
sw2609A-ms98-a-0060 333.935625 335.858375 i
sw2609A-ms98-a-0061 335.858375 337.272875 no i'm not
sw2609A-ms98-a-0062 337.272875 338.500750 [silence]
sw2609A-ms98-a-0063 338.500750 353.215125 and uh so i'm i'm really quite quite curious how that would work to have both i mean you know and i believe in the in a certain uh Soviet block countries you are are obliged to vote too in fact it was even pretty much spelled out who you did vote for up until fairly recently
sw2609A-ms98-a-0064 353.215125 354.304000 and
sw2609A-ms98-a-0065 354.304000 363.789625 that's what i think of when i think of you're obliged to vote but when you actually really are given as much choice as you are in this country with its two party system um
sw2609A-ms98-a-0066 363.789625 370.931750 i don't know i kind of part of me is wary and part of me likes the idea of having it be more of a duty
sw2609A-ms98-a-0067 370.931750 372.561250 um
sw2609A-ms98-a-0068 372.561250 381.800375 [silence]
sw2609A-ms98-a-0069 381.800375 384.001250 um-hum um-hum [noise]
sw2609A-ms98-a-0070 384.001250 385.262250 um-hum
sw2609A-ms98-a-0071 385.262250 388.846375 [silence]
sw2609A-ms98-a-0072 388.846375 391.530750 uh-huh uh-huh well that's a thought
sw2609A-ms98-a-0073 391.530750 399.627500 or certain privileges come from voting which aren't that important but are nice to have i don't know [laughter] the right to write your
sw2609A-ms98-a-0074 399.627500 402.189375 [noise]
sw2609A-ms98-a-0075 402.189375 407.784875 yeah that's see that's an example of a right not a uh not a actually that's considered a privilege not a right
sw2609A-ms98-a-0076 407.784875 416.010500 yeah but technically people most people technically it's a privilege but most people think of it as a right i mean in other words if the government denies you
sw2609A-ms98-a-0077 416.010500 422.815625 driving denies you a drivers license people get very upset but actually it's a privilege which is allowed to be revoked
sw2609A-ms98-a-0078 422.815625 425.806500 and fortunately voting isn't that
sw2609A-ms98-a-0079 425.806500 435.177250 except well except if you're a felon if you're a felon it is taken away from you i mean [vocalized-noise] they will take away your right to vote under certain circumstances
sw2609A-ms98-a-0080 435.177250 436.551250 uh
sw2609A-ms98-a-0081 436.551250 443.036375 so gosh so we don't have a great solution yet do we [laughter]
sw2609A-ms98-a-0082 443.036375 447.141875 [silence]
sw2609A-ms98-a-0083 447.141875 450.769125 [laughter]
sw2609A-ms98-a-0084 450.769125 460.003375 but i i also i- i also [vocalized-noise] i don't know if you've uh read any of the um oh what do they call those the uh the early republican
sw2609A-ms98-a-0085 460.003375 473.117750 uh republic documents uh when they were arguing through constitutional law written by Hamilton and all those people um oh Hamilt[on]- i think it was Hamilton who wrote number ten or something where he was arguing for a republican
sw2609A-ms98-a-0086 473.117750 483.030000 not in the sense of the Republican party now versus a democratic uh government and arguing successfully why the United States should be a republic not a democracy
sw2609A-ms98-a-0087 483.030000 486.032000 which indeed it really is a republic not a democracy
sw2609A-ms98-a-0088 486.032000 495.442125 where he defines dem[ocracy]- democracy as everyone votes for the issues and a republic is people vote for someone who then in turn votes for the issues so as you vote for representatives
sw2609A-ms98-a-0089 495.442125 499.000250 and the whole idea was um
sw2609A-ms98-a-0090 499.000250 510.742875 presumably those who get voted in would be wiser than the average person and and a specialist and able to make more informed decisions and can protect against the tyranny of democracy
sw2609A-ms98-a-0091 510.742875 519.625250 because just as you can have a tyranny of a single um you know bad ruler or something you can have a tyranny of the majority
sw2609A-ms98-a-0092 519.625250 530.051750 and uh he makes a very uh passionate good argument for why you don't want some things decided by democratic process because anytime you have a majority
sw2609A-ms98-a-0093 530.051750 537.820625 um they can change the law in a democ[ratic]- a fully democratic process and there are cases when you don't want that to be the case um
sw2609A-ms98-a-0094 537.820625 551.424750 [noise] oh you know a candi[date]- if there's some minority that people don't like because of you know racial hatred or something like that the majority can just simply vote again vote against them and cases like that he argues need to be constrained and and actually i agree
sw2609A-ms98-a-0095 551.424750 556.628625 except that i don't trust the people who are appointed to vote [laughter]
sw2609A-ms98-a-0096 556.628625 557.856125 [silence]
sw2609A-ms98-a-0097 557.856125 559.658125 [noise]
sw2609A-ms98-a-0098 559.658125 561.009625 [silence]
sw2609A-ms98-a-0099 561.009625 563.745375 yeah well i i mean i feel that
sw2609A-ms98-a-0100 563.745375 565.392875 my you know
sw2609A-ms98-a-0101 565.392875 569.743000 [silence]
sw2609A-ms98-a-0102 569.743000 576.231875 yeah well their job is to be reelected by in large and so they work on that job
sw2609A-ms98-a-0103 576.231875 588.585750 and there's also an {antigovernment} mood in the country you know where government is misspending your dollars and and they're all fools and you know throw throw the bastards out that kind of thing and there's a notion that somehow
sw2609A-ms98-a-0104 588.585750 599.662000 if someone isn't as much as a government person they're less corrupt and they're more likely to be good which is really strange because i mean if i'm hiring a plumber i want a real plumber i want someone trained in in it i'm very like
