sw2625A-ms98-a-0014 113.947625 119.578750 i don't know i've i l[ike]- tend to like a lot of the old uh
sw2625A-ms98-a-0015 119.578750 127.658625 older TV shows like uh for instance there there's i love watching old Twilight Zones and uh th[ey've]-
sw2625A-ms98-a-0016 127.658625 137.707000 they've been there's a s[tation]- station here that runs mostly syndicated things and that's one thing i like to catch on late at night is the old Twilight Zones but uh
sw2625A-ms98-a-0017 137.707000 145.998750 for TV that's out right now i i the shows i like to see for one reason or another that i've been
sw2625A-ms98-a-0018 145.998750 156.744125 catching um Matlock and Tuesday nights for s[ome]- some are i guess are my TV night and i like to see uh Matlock and then In the Heat of the Night uh
sw2625A-ms98-a-0019 156.744125 171.251375 are two shows that that i like to see after seeing the the television show In the Heat of the Night i wanted i haven't never seen the movie but uh i think i'd like to check out that movie sometime it's uh
sw2625A-ms98-a-0020 171.251375 179.906125 i don't know it's just kind of interesting they have great characters in that uh TV show and it's interesting from i just saw the pilot to it
sw2625A-ms98-a-0021 179.906125 187.622875 oh a week or two ago and it was a special two hour thing but it was the first li[ke]- like i said a pilot and uh
sw2625A-ms98-a-0022 187.622875 200.153875 the characters in it were the white police officers when the b[lack]- the black guy from Philadelphia went down there were much more bigoted and more the villains
sw2625A-ms98-a-0023 200.153875 211.338250 in that episode and now over the time in the television show they're all very much uh uh
sw2625A-ms98-a-0024 211.338250 222.437500 n[ot]- not big[oted]- or very m[ore]- m[ore]- you know more in the twentieth century [laughter-now] let's say or or very [vocalized-noise] {unbigoted} and they even have added uh this uh other
sw2625A-ms98-a-0025 222.437500 232.566375 black police officer to the cast so it's interesting how they kind of got away from the or[iginal]- i guess the premise of the movie as well was the problems that that uh
sw2625A-ms98-a-0026 232.566375 244.792875 he had with the police officers and now it's more concentrated on the problems they have in the small town in the south and it it's kind of interesting because it's supposed to be this little tiny town in down in
sw2625A-ms98-a-0027 244.792875 257.860750 uh down south but uh i live in this little teeny town up here in upstate New York and it's not too much different so people got a lot to learn everywhere
