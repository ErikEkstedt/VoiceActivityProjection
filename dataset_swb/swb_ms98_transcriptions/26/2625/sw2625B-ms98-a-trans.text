sw2625B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 7.483500 some of the TV shows that uh i- i like are usually something that shows me something about a profession that i don't
sw2625B-ms98-a-0002 7.483500 18.058750 necessarily know how it operates and one of the earliest shows that uh taught me something was the old Bewitched shows when i was growing up
sw2625B-ms98-a-0003 18.058750 32.528875 i remember thinking so that's how the advertising game is played that's how they developed these things that's where commercials come from and i really didn't uh before that i think that was the very first show that i ever realized that on and then
sw2625B-ms98-a-0004 32.528875 42.855750 oh a little bit later i don't particularly like LA Law as a series but i do like some of the insights not so much into the legal profession but into the
sw2625B-ms98-a-0005 42.855750 53.381125 the fact that some of the well for instance some of the deals that are made by the DA you know you read about some of these things and it sounds really bad well you don't know what's gone on before
sw2625B-ms98-a-0006 53.381125 63.723000 um they had one case where uh the DA had been injured she had been hurt and you know was a little bit fearful of of making frie[nds]- uh any enemies at the moment
sw2625B-ms98-a-0007 63.723000 73.390000 so uh just little things like that makes well there's a human behind this little story you know that that -[wa]s was written up in the paper that DA cuts a bad deal
sw2625B-ms98-a-0008 73.390000 79.629000 as well as some of the the arguments on you know a guy gets arrested for DWI well depending upon
sw2625B-ms98-a-0009 79.629000 88.220750 what the guy says he's going to say in court regardless of the truth what the guy says he's going to say is you know is fifteen minutes later before they gave me the test and
sw2625B-ms98-a-0010 88.220750 94.850625 all these kinds of things and you could probably get away you know get off on it so they just plea bargained it out and is just done with it
sw2625B-ms98-a-0011 94.850625 104.940750 oh i- i those little things i guess i have to be reminded that there're there're so many details that just don't get out that you can't uh can't take the reported word
sw2625B-ms98-a-0012 104.940750 114.775375 for some of these things so i guess i like shows that that show me something some insights into other parts of of living that i don't always get exposed to how about yourself

sw2625B-ms98-a-0027 254.684125 263.033000 huh that's interesting yeah yeah i i've seen Heat of the Night through off and on through out it's uh
sw2625B-ms98-a-0028 263.033000 270.398375 television career as it were and i i wonder if uh if they did that intentionally or if they just had uh
sw2625B-ms98-a-0029 270.398375 283.565875 whether they decided to do away with the the racial problem as the main thrust of it or whether they were going to show that eventually that would die down somewhat that um
sw2625B-ms98-a-0030 283.565875 292.032875 quite possible that they wanted it to become more of the subtle problems that it is today as opposed to the the hitting over the head type problems that it was then
sw2625B-ms98-a-0031 292.032875 296.804625 and uh they they have uh uh pretty good
sw2625B-ms98-a-0032 296.804625 309.839250 bunch of actors and well acted parts i mean you can take a good actor and put him in a bad part and [laughter-it] [laughter-doesn't] do any good but uh they they found a good combination of roles and and actors and actresses on that show and it's a pretty good one
sw2625B-ms98-a-0033 309.839250 313.998250 [silence]
sw2625B-ms98-a-0034 313.998250 317.045500 yeah that's true that's true
sw2625B-ms98-a-0035 317.045500 318.088625 didn't get the

sw2625B-ms98-a-0039 322.570125 329.527875 yeah there're there're just starting to rerun those uh All in the Family down here on a particular on a major station and it's
sw2625B-ms98-a-0040 329.527875 338.740875 uh i never did like it particularly and i've watched a couple of them_1 off and on uh just to get a feel for what what was being said then but it
sw2625B-ms98-a-0041 338.740875 347.880000 uh the i i don't know i[t's]- it's it's a pretty simplistic deal and i mean they they pound whatever message they're going to say over and over and that's about the end of it so
sw2625B-ms98-a-0042 347.880000 354.057625 i don't know if i would have liked it when it was current and and being discussed maybe it would have been a little better but uh

sw2625B-ms98-a-0044 355.060000 359.014375 no the uh the All in the Family reruns that are sh[owing]- showing now
sw2625B-ms98-a-0045 359.014375 372.241375 they they really take whatever point they're wanting to make they they reiterate it over and over you know it's as if the the intelligence level of the people that watch this or something other they handle over a wide you know range of
sw2625B-ms98-a-0046 372.241375 379.496625 of uh topics but uh the uh i don't know maybe it would have been better the first time through when it was more
sw2625B-ms98-a-0047 379.496625 391.218000 uh when the public was talking about it you know sit around the table and talk about the this that and the other but some of the issues seemed a little out dated but of course that's what reruns are for and
