sw2690B-ms98-a-0007 27.222625 33.574250 and uh i was uh greatly disappointed uh when i did move down to Plano to uh
sw2690B-ms98-a-0008 33.574250 36.996375 find out that the uh the uh great
sw2690B-ms98-a-0009 36.996375 40.229250 South Fork Ranch was really only a one bedroom house [laughter]

sw2690B-ms98-a-0032 112.153875 117.710625 well they i think when they open the show up they give you two different views of Dallas one from the east and one from the west
sw2690B-ms98-a-0033 117.710625 119.362250 and that's why
sw2690B-ms98-a-0034 119.362250 123.594375 uh it kind of confuses people but uh uh
sw2690B-ms98-a-0035 123.594375 127.702250 i enjoy a a a lot of different comedies um
sw2690B-ms98-a-0036 127.702250 130.448500 i think it's mainly for an escape
sw2690B-ms98-a-0037 130.448500 139.921250 um you know you uh my job is not the most thrilling in the world and uh i enjoy laughing and uh some of the shows that
sw2690B-ms98-a-0038 139.921250 145.592250 uh are on the air some are just purely you know brain drainers
sw2690B-ms98-a-0039 145.592250 156.203375 and then there's other ones that uh deal with uh in a funny manner uh socially relevant things and uh one show that comes to mind is like Designing Women
sw2690B-ms98-a-0040 156.203375 157.246750 um

sw2690B-ms98-a-0052 183.084125 190.938000 yes it uh it has been very entertaining and and also uh the the issues they deal with uh really tends to open
sw2690B-ms98-a-0053 190.938000 198.459000 open your eyes as well as your mind to some of the problems and uh i've i've really enjoyed that one since it came on
sw2690B-ms98-a-0054 198.459000 210.693500 um don't like the politics surrounding the program though but i mean other than that you know there seems to be a little f[ighting]- in fighting going on between the producers and one of the actresses but uh
sw2690B-ms98-a-0055 210.693500 217.810000 and then uh i've kind of gotten hooked on PBS stuff uh public uh TV
sw2690B-ms98-a-0056 217.810000 227.803125 uh i like things like Nova and uh some of the the special programs they come up with on nature and stuff i just enjoy watching that stuff

sw2690B-ms98-a-0072 294.778625 303.696750 for a while i i i watched some football but i've just got too many more important things in my life now than to sit around and and watch a baseball game

sw2690B-ms98-a-0077 340.019500 347.634125 i uh i personally i i came from the Washington area and so i was a big Washington Redskins fa[n]-
sw2690B-ms98-a-0078 347.634125 354.731250 [laughter] and uh when i came down to Dallas it was uh you know i found myself rooting for the home team
sw2690B-ms98-a-0079 354.731250 360.919000 i uh in fact i have a uh a baseball hat that was signed by Tony Dorsett and Hershel Walker

sw2690B-ms98-a-0100 418.915125 421.036875 yeah that's probably true
sw2690B-ms98-a-0101 421.036875 423.577750 yeah we don't either i uh
sw2690B-ms98-a-0102 423.577750 432.235500 i couldn't rationalize paying you know it's like if i pay for a movie channel then i have to watch what movies they want me to watch when they want me to watch them_1
sw2690B-ms98-a-0103 432.235500 434.201625 and if i
sw2690B-ms98-a-0104 434.201625 438.816750 you know if i didn't use cable for anything else other than the basic well i can get that for free
sw2690B-ms98-a-0105 438.816750 447.662500 and well i d[on't]- really don't need CNN i see enough bad news all the time [laughter-i] [laughter-don't] [laughter-need] to see more of it so i i've kind of uh
sw2690B-ms98-a-0106 447.662500 453.319375 rationalized that it's it's probably a lot more economical for us to just go rent the movies we want to see
sw2690B-ms98-a-0107 453.319375 461.420375 and of course when we were living in Texas it was real convenient with Tom Thumb you know having movies uh back then it was ninety nine cents i mean go
sw2690B-ms98-a-0108 461.420375 462.712000 yeah

sw2690B-ms98-a-0110 465.343000 470.266125 and you can see them_1 a lot sooner than you can see them_1 on any of the stations like HBO or Cinemax

sw2690B-ms98-a-0118 490.098625 495.330125 yeah and i i've been trying to get my wife to go with me to go see it she
sw2690B-ms98-a-0119 495.330125 498.366625 she doesn't like going to movie theaters because usually they're dirty
sw2690B-ms98-a-0120 498.366625 499.318375 [laughter]
sw2690B-ms98-a-0121 499.318375 512.470750 and uh you know she just doesn't like them and um she doesn't think that she could sit still for three hours and watch the movie and i've told her you know everybody i know that has seen it has said that the three hours go really quick
sw2690B-ms98-a-0122 512.470750 518.110125 and uh so i'm i'm hoping i can get her talked into it soon

sw2690B-ms98-a-0127 536.961000 542.120250 yeah but as as far as uh regular TV shows i mean i've got some
sw2690B-ms98-a-0128 542.120250 547.328000 some shows that i that that i would be afraid to admit to you that i've actually sat down and watched [laughter]
sw2690B-ms98-a-0129 547.328000 548.902375 [laughter]
sw2690B-ms98-a-0130 548.902375 560.933375 and then there's there's others that uh uh i i wish i had time to see it's like i enjoy watching Cheers it's very funny some of the things in it are mindless but i i just don't have time to watch it
sw2690B-ms98-a-0131 560.933375 567.781875 um i think about the only night that i really sit in front of the TV set all night long probably is on Monday nights and because
sw2690B-ms98-a-0132 567.781875 574.876750 um i work so hard over the weekend doing other things with the kids and stuff and going to work on Monday Monday night i'm just worn out
sw2690B-ms98-a-0133 574.876750 583.087750 so i kind of use it as the time to catch up on correspondence and and look over things and i can sit in front of the TV set and look at you know
sw2690B-ms98-a-0134 583.087750 587.096375 do go through my mail and and watch TV at the same time
