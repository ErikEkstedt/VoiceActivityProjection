sw2690A-ms98-a-0013 66.567875 76.469125 and that's that's the two things they associate with Dallas Texas so i and i they asked me s[everal]- several times they ask me why are there two bridges
sw2690A-ms98-a-0014 76.469125 81.439875 and i didn't know what they were talking about it took me a long time they're talking about the viaducts
sw2690A-ms98-a-0015 81.439875 84.157000 is that that is right isn't it
sw2690A-ms98-a-0016 84.157000 88.161000 because they ask me why are there two bridges going into Dallas
sw2690A-ms98-a-0017 88.161000 89.196000 [silence]
sw2690A-ms98-a-0018 89.196000 93.681750 darned if i know [laughter] i was blank looking you know i felt really dumb
sw2690A-ms98-a-0019 93.681750 104.402625 [silence]

sw2690A-ms98-a-0021 108.991375 114.994000 [silence]
sw2690A-ms98-a-0022 114.994000 116.650250 oh do they
sw2690A-ms98-a-0023 116.650250 118.534250 oh

sw2690A-ms98-a-0026 144.787500 146.209125 uh-huh
sw2690A-ms98-a-0027 146.209125 156.159375 [silence]
sw2690A-ms98-a-0028 156.159375 164.869375 i think that is just a hoot that's one of those few that i do watch and the television is on my husband likes to watch TV it's on
sw2690A-ms98-a-0029 164.869375 167.878875 i usually read and watch TV
sw2690A-ms98-a-0030 167.878875 175.618875 and usually i can handle both at the same time you know because i am pretty sure where the TV plot's going
sw2690A-ms98-a-0031 175.618875 181.234000 but that's one of the few that i just actually watch because_1 it's funny
sw2690A-ms98-a-0032 181.234000 183.453375 i really enjoy that one
sw2690A-ms98-a-0033 183.453375 227.002000 [silence]
sw2690A-ms98-a-0034 227.002000 233.396750 now we watch a lot of those uh and the ones that sometimes will hook me
sw2690A-ms98-a-0035 233.396750 240.904625 to put down my book will be the one there was one uh recently about the Gettysburg Address
sw2690A-ms98-a-0036 240.904625 244.339125 and they wrapped a fictional story around it
sw2690A-ms98-a-0037 244.339125 246.941750 and i thought that was well done
sw2690A-ms98-a-0038 246.941750 251.146375 and and it it caught my attention i wound up watching the whole thing
sw2690A-ms98-a-0039 251.146375 252.532750 um
sw2690A-ms98-a-0040 252.532750 253.545375 [silence]
sw2690A-ms98-a-0041 253.545375 259.699125 i guess the awards ceremonies and there seems to be dozens of them per year
sw2690A-ms98-a-0042 259.699125 265.693125 maybe i've spent two minutes watching to see what they have on and if they make a fool of themselves or not
sw2690A-ms98-a-0043 265.693125 266.811375 [laughter]
sw2690A-ms98-a-0044 266.811375 272.313625 but uh they could take that whole collection and it would disappear and i'd never miss it for a minute
sw2690A-ms98-a-0045 272.313625 279.387375 particularly the beauty pageants i i particularly take issue with those i i really dislike those
sw2690A-ms98-a-0046 279.387375 303.001375 [silence]
sw2690A-ms98-a-0047 303.001375 309.482625 you know my husband used to just be riveted to the Dallas Cowboys and now
sw2690A-ms98-a-0048 309.482625 317.303875 we're out running around and if they're if they're playing he'll turn it on while we're in the car to see what the score is and he'll listen
sw2690A-ms98-a-0049 317.303875 326.954375 but even i've said hey look you're fascinated with this you sit and listen to the Cowboys let me run in here and i'll do some things and i'll come back and you don't have to miss he'll say nah nah nah
sw2690A-ms98-a-0050 326.954375 331.112375 and he doesn't he doesn't watch it he li[sten]- like i say if it's convenient he'll listen to it
sw2690A-ms98-a-0051 331.112375 334.219500 but he just doesn't watch them_1 on TV like he used to
sw2690A-ms98-a-0052 334.219500 344.672875 [silence]
sw2690A-ms98-a-0053 344.672875 346.153500 oh
sw2690A-ms98-a-0054 346.153500 348.869875 oh those people [laughter-yeah]
sw2690A-ms98-a-0055 348.869875 359.984625 [silence]
sw2690A-ms98-a-0056 359.984625 361.778875 oh how neat
sw2690A-ms98-a-0057 361.778875 364.021625 [silence]
sw2690A-ms98-a-0058 364.021625 369.515625 well i actually got to go see them win in the Super Bowl when they went down to New Orleans
sw2690A-ms98-a-0059 369.515625 379.486750 and i i i made the trip and did the whole New Orleans before the game and the game and everything and uh that was
sw2690A-ms98-a-0060 379.486750 383.707250 that was a lot of fun but
sw2690A-ms98-a-0061 383.707250 393.660000 i don't know i haven't been as i'll tell you what i love to watch and this is not this is rarely on television but what is a lot of fun to go attend is this arena football
sw2690A-ms98-a-0062 393.660000 397.606000 yeah i like it's so much better than straight football
sw2690A-ms98-a-0063 397.606000 399.815750 [silence]
sw2690A-ms98-a-0064 399.815750 405.115750 it it doesn't it has a lot of different rules the field is half the size
sw2690A-ms98-a-0065 405.115750 407.878875 and there's no
sw2690A-ms98-a-0066 407.878875 412.309000 they can't call time and things like that it moves a lot faster
sw2690A-ms98-a-0067 412.309000 415.445875 [silence]
sw2690A-ms98-a-0068 415.445875 421.266000 uh again i think it may be on cable more than anything else we don't have cable
sw2690A-ms98-a-0069 421.266000 453.137375 [silence]
sw2690A-ms98-a-0070 453.137375 454.504000 well
sw2690A-ms98-a-0071 454.504000 457.461375 [silence]
sw2690A-ms98-a-0072 457.461375 458.737375 oh
sw2690A-ms98-a-0073 458.737375 460.099625 [silence]
sw2690A-ms98-a-0074 460.099625 465.597750 they're everywhere they're on every corner everything you've ever wanted to see
sw2690A-ms98-a-0075 465.597750 469.056625 [silence]
sw2690A-ms98-a-0076 469.056625 476.318125 well and i like to rent tapes because you can put the thing on hold if you get a telephone call or something like that
sw2690A-ms98-a-0077 476.318125 483.995875 or it becomes snack time for various reasons you can put you know the only thing this Dance with Wolves i want to see it in a theater
sw2690A-ms98-a-0078 483.995875 485.407875 [silence]
sw2690A-ms98-a-0079 485.407875 490.881750 because i understand that that your you'll lose fifty percent of it if you don't
sw2690A-ms98-a-0080 490.881750 511.245125 [silence]
sw2690A-ms98-a-0081 511.245125 513.421375 that's what i hear too
sw2690A-ms98-a-0082 513.421375 517.497500 [silence]
sw2690A-ms98-a-0083 517.497500 524.140375 well my husband smokes he's one of the dinosaurs that still smokes and you can't smoke in movie theaters
sw2690A-ms98-a-0084 524.140375 527.780625 and that has really slowed down the forward progress of going to movies
sw2690A-ms98-a-0085 527.780625 534.990000 but i haven't really cared up until this point but i we are this weekend going to go see Dance with Wolves it's that's it we will do it
sw2690A-ms98-a-0086 534.990000 537.606875 so yeah finally
sw2690A-ms98-a-0087 537.606875 546.025250 [silence]
sw2690A-ms98-a-0088 546.025250 549.694500 [laughter]
sw2690A-ms98-a-0089 549.694500 586.685625 [silence]
sw2690A-ms98-a-0090 586.685625 591.813750 well i tend my job tends to be very demanding
sw2690A-ms98-a-0091 591.813750 600.452000 and to sit down and to mindlessly either read or just mindlessly stare in absolute comfort isn't as bad as it used to
