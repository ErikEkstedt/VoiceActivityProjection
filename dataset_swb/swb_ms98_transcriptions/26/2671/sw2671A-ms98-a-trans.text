sw2671A-ms98-a-0032 135.943375 144.038125 it seems so odd to me that David Bowie is showing up in People magazine it's just like wait a minute [laughter] i mean you know it's like oh

sw2671A-ms98-a-0034 153.953500 163.396000 i mean i'm not i'm not a huge Bowie fan but i like his music actually the the coolest Bowie thing that o[ne]- o[ne]- o[ne]- one of the coolest things i have happens to be a Bowie item it's a um
sw2671A-ms98-a-0035 163.396000 164.425875 um
sw2671A-ms98-a-0036 164.425875 177.298000 it's a picture disk with uh of him and Bing Crosby doing Peace on Earth uh Little Drummer Boy and you know you can get this as a forty five but this is like a twelve inch with um the um the label is
sw2671A-ms98-a-0037 177.298000 183.563500 instead of being a real label is a picture of him and Bing from the uh from the Christmas special that it was from
sw2671A-ms98-a-0038 183.563500 186.312875 it's it's a trip um
sw2671A-ms98-a-0039 186.312875 195.423000 yeah you can get uh you know if you can ge[t]- actually buy the forty five it's usually out around [laughter-Christmas] [laughter-time] because it's it's it's a really neat song actually and they d[o]- they do a good duet
sw2671A-ms98-a-0040 195.423000 206.401250 um but it's it's always the thing that's like oh you know you know when i got people over and we're trying to you know you know uh you know weirding people out on music that one usually gets [laughter-them_1]

sw2671A-ms98-a-0048 234.580125 241.803250 um-hum well i know the feeling when i've gone um and just knocked myself out um i'm a big Who fan
sw2671A-ms98-a-0049 241.803250 255.744250 and i've gone and knocked myself out sometimes finding old Who forty fives with like these B sides that never got put on an album you know and i was knocking mys[elf]- you know i found these a bunch of them_1 you know didn't spend a whole lot of money on them_1 um
sw2671A-ms98-a-0050 255.744250 262.523250 yeah i've yeah it was a big thing well i got i have a friend who's like the forty five king of the world he has
sw2671A-ms98-a-0051 262.523250 268.370750 something along the lines of fifteen thousand forty fives he has every top forty single
sw2671A-ms98-a-0052 268.370750 278.108375 since he was born nineteen you know like nineteen sixty four and i think every top twenty single going back to around fifty five i think he's cut it out lately because_1 m[ost]- most of the stuff
sw2671A-ms98-a-0053 278.108375 289.302250 you know he can only get as cassette single and he you know we both despise cassette [laughter-singles] um but he's found some of the Who stuff for me and you know we went you know all all this trouble to find this and then
sw2671A-ms98-a-0054 289.302250 295.031000 they released a couple Who rarity albums that had like half the [laughter-stuff] on it it's like great
sw2671A-ms98-a-0055 295.031000 300.606250 you know and then the one other i think the one other Who thing he located for me was um
sw2671A-ms98-a-0056 300.606250 303.881250 uh i don't know if you're familiar with the Who they they have a song called Substitute
sw2671A-ms98-a-0057 303.881250 304.946375 [silence]
sw2671A-ms98-a-0058 304.946375 306.390625 doesn't ring a bell
sw2671A-ms98-a-0059 306.390625 307.911250 oh okay
sw2671A-ms98-a-0060 307.911250 309.470750 [silence]
sw2671A-ms98-a-0061 309.470750 313.032500 okay anyway um there was a
sw2671A-ms98-a-0062 313.032500 316.384125 um a single of Substitute out and
sw2671A-ms98-a-0063 316.384125 328.902500 okay now you know what i'm talking about yeah um anyway it came out in the mid sixties in in this country on a weird re[cord]- on a record label that they aren't normally on so it was cool they find it for that but the B side was something called Waltz for a Pig which
sw2671A-ms98-a-0064 328.902500 341.568625 wasn't on any record and it wasn't on the rarity records so this was a big deal and then um you know once once Steve found it for me and everything i i happened to go a[nd]- and look back at some like Who biographies i have and uh i discovered that
sw2671A-ms98-a-0065 341.568625 352.144125 the B side isn't actually by the Who it's by what's called the Who Orchestra because there was some like legal thing that said the Who couldn't record and so it was actually by the by a band called the Grand Bond [laughter-Organization]
sw2671A-ms98-a-0066 352.144125 357.079125 so it's like gee all this trouble and it's not even the Who oh well it's a fun thing to have [laughter-anyway]
sw2671A-ms98-a-0067 357.079125 358.675500 [silence]
sw2671A-ms98-a-0068 358.675500 362.925125 but it turns out that um
sw2671A-ms98-a-0069 362.925125 368.320375 uh you know listening to the the version of Substitute on the single it's actually different than
sw2671A-ms98-a-0070 368.320375 372.380875 than um the one that was normally in the US because um
sw2671A-ms98-a-0071 372.380875 379.523500 uh there was some lyrics they found objectionable i think the one uh i look all white but my dad was black
sw2671A-ms98-a-0072 379.523500 387.916500 um the American record companies said nah [laughter] you know you can't release this so they it has a different lyric on it so that's kind of neat
sw2671A-ms98-a-0073 387.916500 389.630875 but
sw2671A-ms98-a-0074 389.630875 391.421125 yeah
sw2671A-ms98-a-0075 391.421125 402.968125 well yeah um you know i have um you know like you were saying you know i've got i have a lot a lot of bootlegs and stuff by the Who and uh by Pete Townsend and uh some of the really fun stuff with Townsend is um
sw2671A-ms98-a-0076 402.968125 407.331750 o[ne]- one of the demos i have is called Obscure and Oblique and it's it's a bunch of demos
sw2671A-ms98-a-0077 407.331750 421.533250 and i [laughter] you know i'm really curious actually how they got their hands on this stuff but um it's really cool listening to the stuff because_1 um you hear things that are different than the way the Who actually recorded the song or or he recorded the song solo
sw2671A-ms98-a-0078 421.533250 427.099000 and it's just kind of interesting to see his um you know
sw2671A-ms98-a-0079 427.099000 441.260375 yeah there's um he's also put out a couple albums called Scoop Scoop and Another Scoop which um are collections of demos so i have like three collections of demos of his and there's a couple songs in the collections that are
sw2671A-ms98-a-0080 441.260375 447.820875 the sa[me]- almost the same as songs the Who did on their last album but aren't [laughter]
sw2671A-ms98-a-0081 447.820875 456.582750 so that's that's really cool i mean there's this one song called Popular that became the song It's Hard with um a different verse [laughter]
sw2671A-ms98-a-0082 456.582750 457.673000 so
sw2671A-ms98-a-0083 457.673000 458.543125 [noise]

sw2671A-ms98-a-0096 494.393375 498.441875 [silence]
sw2671A-ms98-a-0097 498.441875 502.881250 yeah i'm like that a lot with the Who i've got
sw2671A-ms98-a-0098 502.881250 513.776250 i i counted it up sometime and i have like twelve versions of Pinball Wizard by you know either by the Who or it's a demo or it's a live version by the Who and then there's like the Elton John version and then um
sw2671A-ms98-a-0099 513.776250 526.480625 i guess the the the weirdest ones i have are ones by the New Seekers you know the guys that did I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing and uh the other one is uh Rod Stewart of all people R[od]-
sw2671A-ms98-a-0100 526.480625 533.448625 [silence]

sw2671A-ms98-a-0104 570.828125 579.452250 [silence]
sw2671A-ms98-a-0105 579.452250 585.487875 well the the problem with the problem with Pinball Wizard is that
sw2671A-ms98-a-0106 585.487875 590.456125 it's you you hear it on the radio and it's completely out of context with
sw2671A-ms98-a-0107 590.456125 593.331250 because it it it's part of a larger work
sw2671A-ms98-a-0108 593.331250 599.769375 and um so i don't know i mean i don['t]- i don't want to disagree with you i i
