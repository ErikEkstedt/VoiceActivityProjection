sw2616A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.747125 [noise]
sw2616A-ms98-a-0002 0.747125 11.862750 okay so i think i think what we should talk about is the the war um the war that just went on see i don't agree with it first of all i don't believe in war
sw2616A-ms98-a-0003 11.862750 17.427125 and then the United States has this attitude by saying you know thank you for
sw2616A-ms98-a-0004 17.427125 28.943250 keeping us our freedom and stuff like that and i think it's all independent because it's it has nothing to do with the United States you didn't gain anything from it
sw2616A-ms98-a-0005 28.943250 34.176625 and it wasn't our freedom that you were saving it was just
sw2616A-ms98-a-0006 34.176625 46.346250 the thing the thing that that uh that i saw was okay Iraq wants to raise oil prices Kuwait wants to take Iraq out of the whole system by leaving them independent
sw2616A-ms98-a-0007 46.346250 52.284125 and so when Iraq you know saw this they said let's take over the country which is a good idea
sw2616A-ms98-a-0008 52.284125 65.204000 right then the United States says okay our our oil prices are going to go up and like for example see okay like Li[thuania]- Lithuania right they declared themselves uh an independent country with a president right
sw2616A-ms98-a-0009 65.204000 71.631875 Russia goes in there well the main government in Moscow goes in there and they kick everybody's ass
sw2616A-ms98-a-0010 71.631875 82.162625 and the United States doesn't go in there and say listen they were uh you know named an independent you know state with a president and everything but we're not going to go into your country 
sw2616A-ms98-a-0011 82.162625 89.489875 but these countries here which you know are you know like in nineteen eighty four have you ever read that book
sw2616A-ms98-a-0012 89.489875 103.648750 okay nineteen eighty four there are like three big continents and uh there's just this area like around Egypt and stuff that everybody's fighting over now the problem is is that nobody's going to invade anybody else's boundaries
sw2616A-ms98-a-0013 103.648750 117.386375 right like their immediate boundaries like you're not going to go you know it's like the Army's not going to go straight into Russia because there you're you're invading their border right but all the other countries you can fight about
sw2616A-ms98-a-0014 117.386375 129.995750 and so the thing is is that you're wasting so much money to send you know it's like how much money did the US spend when they could have paid so much money for each barrel of oil that was being
sw2616A-ms98-a-0015 129.995750 132.143875 [silence]
sw2616A-ms98-a-0016 132.143875 145.470500 and you know it's it was uh basically all based on oil because nobody actually like for example if uh let's say if uh you know Brazil took over you know Surinam i don't think anybody would care
sw2616A-ms98-a-0017 145.470500 147.752375 you know and uh
sw2616A-ms98-a-0018 147.752375 157.498250 that's something that that has been you know very because see the thing is is like every time that i see a war i see myself on the front line
sw2616A-ms98-a-0019 157.498250 171.364875 and on the other side i see myself again and i got to shoot myself you know [noise] i got to shoot somebody tha[t's]- -[tha]t's got the same family that i do you know the same relationships that i do and just because i was born here i've got to shoot them_1 down
sw2616A-ms98-a-0020 171.364875 173.434750 [silence]
sw2616A-ms98-a-0021 173.434750 185.453750 and uh but at least it was it was over quick and there weren't that many deaths [noise] now the only problem is is the aftermath that you're having so many deaths in the border with uh Turkey
sw2616A-ms98-a-0022 185.453750 186.671875 [silence]
sw2616A-ms98-a-0023 186.671875 187.888500 and uh
sw2616A-ms98-a-0024 187.888500 191.922625 [silence]
sw2616A-ms98-a-0025 191.922625 192.983750 well
sw2616A-ms98-a-0026 192.983750 199.097250 the[re's]- there's something that that the US did right which is say say you know okay let's kick him out of Kuwait
sw2616A-ms98-a-0027 199.097250 201.194500 which was our basic goal
sw2616A-ms98-a-0028 201.194500 205.823875 and uh now indirectly let's try to overthrow him
sw2616A-ms98-a-0029 205.823875 209.738750 you know and they're not going to do that directly
sw2616A-ms98-a-0030 209.738750 224.142125 but the thing is is that they they didn't go into into Iraq and say you know because they have the force to go in there and say get out of the country you know you can seek [vocalized-noise] seek asylum here and you can go there but no way are you going to rule ever again 
sw2616A-ms98-a-0031 224.142125 230.957750 [silence]
sw2616A-ms98-a-0032 230.957750 235.925125 well the thing is is that first of all they got to they go[t]- they have to get him
sw2616A-ms98-a-0033 235.925125 237.000125 [silence]
sw2616A-ms98-a-0034 237.000125 240.510875 and and there's no way that you can get him unless it's by force
sw2616A-ms98-a-0035 240.510875 243.375375 you know and then you can put him on trial
sw2616A-ms98-a-0036 243.375375 244.548125 [silence]
sw2616A-ms98-a-0037 244.548125 258.546125 no no i think i think he'd rather commit suicide than turn himself in because there's i mean there's like it's like there's no hope you know like what Hitler did you know like if you were going to put on trial you get to live the rest of your life but where
sw2616A-ms98-a-0038 258.546125 267.398125 you know and so um the thing is is that [noise] once you've done something wrong which is natio[nally]- you know internationally recognized
sw2616A-ms98-a-0039 267.398125 277.009000 then you're going to try to get out of it and the there's no way you know and especially since he's got inside Iraq for using you know chemical weapons and stuff
sw2616A-ms98-a-0040 277.009000 283.754625 and you know like he sent planes over to to shoot the people down that were on the border with uh tha[t]- [vocalized-noise] that were on their way to Turkey 
sw2616A-ms98-a-0041 283.754625 286.297000 he had a couple of them bombarded
sw2616A-ms98-a-0042 286.297000 289.430000 [silence]
sw2616A-ms98-a-0043 289.430000 290.802250 um-hum
sw2616A-ms98-a-0044 290.802250 292.815125 but uh
sw2616A-ms98-a-0045 292.815125 294.670750 you know he's got uh
sw2616A-ms98-a-0046 294.670750 296.526375 millions of dollars like
sw2616A-ms98-a-0047 296.526375 303.827500 fi[fty]- i think it was like i don't know if it was fifty billion or fifty million which is really doesn't make any difference [laughter]
sw2616A-ms98-a-0048 303.827500 305.306500 yeah
sw2616A-ms98-a-0049 305.306500 306.508875 and
sw2616A-ms98-a-0050 306.508875 308.943000 [silence]
sw2616A-ms98-a-0051 308.943000 321.405125 but it's just it's just that uh you know i[t]- you know like the we just put our goals in different you know levels is like saying you know it's like yeah sure we need oil you know and we need it desperately
sw2616A-ms98-a-0052 321.405125 335.778125 but the other countries that you know that have oil but not as big you know like they say you know like when the prices went up and then they went down when they took that big dip it was because they discovered another big oil well somewhere in Saudi Arabia or something
sw2616A-ms98-a-0053 335.778125 340.002500 [silence]
sw2616A-ms98-a-0054 340.002500 347.354875 well th[e]- it it's an advantage you know it's like you're saying okay i can bring my prices up to a dollar fifty a gallon
sw2616A-ms98-a-0055 347.354875 354.140750 and i'm not going to bring them_1 back down to you know ninety nine cents why because people are willing to pay a dollar fifty a gallon
sw2616A-ms98-a-0056 354.140750 357.493250 so if i te[n]- leave it at a dollar ten people are still going to pay
sw2616A-ms98-a-0057 357.493250 361.455250 you know i went down forty cents but i went up ten cents
sw2616A-ms98-a-0058 361.455250 362.495500 you know
sw2616A-ms98-a-0059 362.495500 368.779000 [silence]
sw2616A-ms98-a-0060 368.779000 370.297000 ninety eight
sw2616A-ms98-a-0061 370.297000 371.432750 [silence]
sw2616A-ms98-a-0062 371.432750 372.837000 oh God
sw2616A-ms98-a-0063 372.837000 377.457375 here it's like it's like a dollar five yeah
sw2616A-ms98-a-0064 377.457375 384.292000 [silence]
sw2616A-ms98-a-0065 384.292000 393.370375 but still the i mean have you ever checked like uh the most money makers in uh in nineteen uh ninety
sw2616A-ms98-a-0066 393.370375 405.878750 uh you can see that uh Exxon and Amaco and uh other companies oh God i forgot their names but uh Exxon was the number one money maker and that was just because o[f]- of the last quarter
sw2616A-ms98-a-0067 405.878750 407.449000 [silence]
sw2616A-ms98-a-0068 407.449000 408.923375 yeah
sw2616A-ms98-a-0069 408.923375 411.113125 [silence]
sw2616A-ms98-a-0070 411.113125 418.293625 and uh that was i mean and one of the companies uh went up four hundred and some percent
sw2616A-ms98-a-0071 418.293625 425.639500 and that's practically impossible to do now a days for a company to to shoot up in that way and uh
sw2616A-ms98-a-0072 425.639500 427.720250 it's just that you know people
sw2616A-ms98-a-0073 427.720250 437.007750 people take a[dvantage]- take advantage of that you know like the the companies were saying we're trying not to raise our prices but when you know when we get a barrel coming in at more than what we're selling it for we've got to raise our prices
sw2616A-ms98-a-0074 437.007750 442.911250 you know but still if you realize that uh one barrel has like how much was it like uh
sw2616A-ms98-a-0075 442.911250 444.348125 forty gallons
sw2616A-ms98-a-0076 444.348125 448.062750 something it's got forty gallons and they're selling you know
sw2616A-ms98-a-0077 448.062750 458.399875 y[ou]- you know y[ou]- you got to pay forty dollars at least and you know for uh for one gallon and it's it was selling like at twenty five or something
sw2616A-ms98-a-0078 458.399875 463.261625 so you're making uh you know fifteen dollars profit easily
sw2616A-ms98-a-0079 463.261625 477.928125 and uh everything i mean and and the expenses you know of the war you know it's like uh you know it's like who's gaining on this okay because uh i uh does does the US government own any gas companies like like you know like gas stations and stuff 
sw2616A-ms98-a-0080 477.928125 481.052375 i because see like for example
sw2616A-ms98-a-0081 481.052375 486.144500 i don't know if the British government owns Shell i'm not sure about that
sw2616A-ms98-a-0082 486.144500 489.511500 but the thing is like the US government got nothing out of it
sw2616A-ms98-a-0083 489.511500 495.810500 because well you know it's like oth[er]- the other independent companies the gas stations you know and they did 
sw2616A-ms98-a-0084 495.810500 500.407125 and uh then the taxes go up and then everybody else loses
sw2616A-ms98-a-0085 500.407125 503.428500 but um you know they're just
sw2616A-ms98-a-0086 503.428500 507.283250 they're just some things that might not be worth it
sw2616A-ms98-a-0087 507.283250 516.623125 you know and and uh first of all how many how many people had to had to die before the war [laughter] you know it's like transporting stuff and
sw2616A-ms98-a-0088 516.623125 531.305875 things like that before you know it's like yeah sure you know like to to a couple people that died there their families don't feel it was necessary to do that yeah yeah you you could never you could never bring them_1 back so oh well
sw2616A-ms98-a-0089 531.305875 533.803625 [silence]
sw2616A-ms98-a-0090 533.803625 536.973500 yeah so okay nice talking to you
sw2616A-ms98-a-0091 536.973500 538.541875 bye-bye
sw2616A-ms98-a-0092 538.541875 540.719875 [noise]
