sw4169B-ms98-a-0023 112.457625 118.872875 so they go into all sorts of neat little off the wall kind of topics that you normally wouldn't get
sw4169B-ms98-a-0024 118.872875 130.533375 in uh in uh [noise] in a conventional news broadcast or even on CNN it's sort of like socketed little special interest kinds of things and it's really fascinating to see you know they're out there covering it
sw4169B-ms98-a-0025 130.533375 139.591625 um one thing i wanted to ask you about was the you're you said you're in Dallas the quality of your local papers do you do you see

sw4169B-ms98-a-0041 209.113750 217.311500 and just to give you an idea of what i meant by pandering it's like sometimes they their news for the news for the incredible stupid or comatose
