sw4153B-ms98-a-0042 149.323250 155.813750 it sounds like to me your [noise] your concern would be to make sure that they are loving people
sw4153B-ms98-a-0043 155.813750 162.344375 [laughter] affectionate people that they're they're kind of par[ents]- [noise] maybe parents themselves or something

sw4153B-ms98-a-0050 190.482875 195.795375 yeah i- i- i think that's probably a really important thing because you can have
sw4153B-ms98-a-0051 195.795375 201.411000 doctorates and PhD's and all that kind of thing and you know know all the technical stuff
sw4153B-ms98-a-0052 201.411000 205.866000 but if they don't reach out and touch the kids then that doesn't do any good

sw4153B-ms98-a-0058 219.512875 220.908125 an[d]-
sw4153B-ms98-a-0059 220.908125 231.236750 the other the other group that we had was kind of interesting the other one we went to the it was a husband and wife team and we knew them from other associations but
sw4153B-ms98-a-0060 231.236750 242.636500 uh it was kind of interesting because she was kind of the strict one and i think you know she would she'd put her arm around the kids and talk to them_1 and stuff you know but he was actually the more
sw4153B-ms98-a-0061 242.636500 244.307125 um
sw4153B-ms98-a-0062 244.307125 252.283750 the more uh what demonstrative type the more loving he would you know laugh with the kids and play with the kids and
sw4153B-ms98-a-0063 252.283750 257.499875 and it it it was kind of interesting to see that that that it was actually the man in the group that
sw4153B-ms98-a-0064 257.499875 260.828250 that did that side of it an[d]-
sw4153B-ms98-a-0065 260.828250 267.388000 yeah so they had a really nice balance we liked that one in fact it was called Humpty Dumpty Play School or something but they also did
sw4153B-ms98-a-0066 267.388000 273.381750 they also did some of the teaching things and then they had um
sw4153B-ms98-a-0067 273.381750 277.191000 you know obedience obedience was important
sw4153B-ms98-a-0068 277.191000 281.158125 and you know so they u[sed]- you know they used uh
sw4153B-ms98-a-0069 281.158125 287.702250 oh i think they used the you probably heard where you know where you stand in front of the clock and get your power back to control yourself
sw4153B-ms98-a-0070 287.702250 297.309500 and it's it's it's one uh i can't remember what they call it exactly but y[ou]- you just stand them_1 in front of the clock and you know it has a second hand that goes around 
sw4153B-ms98-a-0071 297.309500 298.466000 and they have to stand there
