sw4196B-ms98-a-0003 2.490750 16.017375 well Frank um generally i keep on up oh listening to radio news uh listening to some television news uh the rest of it i guess what everybody's talking about um
sw4196B-ms98-a-0004 16.017375 29.498000 i guess if part of me says if it's that important i'll find out if i don't find out it's not that important into the way that it affects my life right now um
sw4196B-ms98-a-0005 29.498000 35.998750 [noise] that's i guess that's primarily why um we do go through periods where we uh
sw4196B-ms98-a-0006 35.998750 47.788250 do get the local newspaper um you know and for for a city of a hundred and eighty thousand people the newspaper is still very slanted and uh you know 
sw4196B-ms98-a-0007 47.788250 52.226125 you end up and you say well yeah okay and you
sw4196B-ms98-a-0008 52.226125 53.283625 [silence]
sw4196B-ms98-a-0009 53.283625 55.275125 uh
sw4196B-ms98-a-0010 55.275125 56.705375 [silence]
sw4196B-ms98-a-0011 56.705375 58.963875 oh i would say maybe it's
sw4196B-ms98-a-0012 58.963875 69.996125 a little morbid to the right now you know here we kind of talk more liberal and conservative rather than left right but uh it's a fairly liberal minded um
sw4196B-ms98-a-0013 69.996125 71.000000 [silence]
sw4196B-ms98-a-0014 71.000000 77.987250 but you know it's uh you tend to only get the one side you don't get kind of uh
sw4196B-ms98-a-0015 77.987250 82.521500 a broad coverage of of the reality of what happened
sw4196B-ms98-a-0016 82.521500 118.982125 [silence]
sw4196B-ms98-a-0017 118.982125 132.285375 right yeah i- i guess i would think that you have a bit of an advantage in that you do have a an option for something that is more local and then something that is more statewide
sw4196B-ms98-a-0018 132.285375 136.252500 um here i guess really we're dealing with uh
sw4196B-ms98-a-0019 136.252500 137.259875 [silence]
sw4196B-ms98-a-0020 137.259875 139.499875 the regions being
sw4196B-ms98-a-0021 139.499875 140.497375 [silence]
sw4196B-ms98-a-0022 140.497375 146.727375 i- i hesitate to say sparsely populated but really you know we'll get to one region that's uh
sw4196B-ms98-a-0023 146.727375 152.182375 several hundreds miles square and we've only got a few million people involved
sw4196B-ms98-a-0024 152.182375 164.471625 and uh you know so regional coverage uh is pretty sparse and so we our next step from local tends to be virtually national or international
sw4196B-ms98-a-0025 164.471625 171.989250 and and i suppose you might compare it to you don't hear very much North Dakota news
sw4196B-ms98-a-0026 171.989250 174.283750 um you know so
sw4196B-ms98-a-0027 174.283750 175.493125 [silence]
sw4196B-ms98-a-0028 175.493125 182.185500 uh w[e]- we can at times you know being you know being right on the north edge of North Dakota we
sw4196B-ms98-a-0029 182.185500 191.710875 uh we actually uh some of the current events are more an aspect of uh some uh sports interaction between North Dakota and Saskatchewan
sw4196B-ms98-a-0030 191.710875 201.487875 and uh it's not hardly an current event as such but um Minot does a lot of advertising to uh bring tourist industry down
sw4196B-ms98-a-0031 201.487875 213.995500 um so you know we kind of get stuck with uh you get your local news or you get your news that's based nationally and uh so then it has
sw4196B-ms98-a-0032 213.995500 226.000000 anything that intends to be local interest uh is quite localized Toronto Montreal Ottawa Vancouver that kind of thing you know so you're getting uh
sw4196B-ms98-a-0033 226.000000 236.975625 [silence]
sw4196B-ms98-a-0034 236.975625 238.516000 um-hum
sw4196B-ms98-a-0035 238.516000 247.484500 [silence]
sw4196B-ms98-a-0036 247.484500 248.754000 oh yeah
sw4196B-ms98-a-0037 248.754000 249.801000 [silence]
sw4196B-ms98-a-0038 249.801000 250.992500 um-hum
sw4196B-ms98-a-0039 250.992500 254.492250 [silence]
sw4196B-ms98-a-0040 254.492250 255.990250 yeah
sw4196B-ms98-a-0041 255.990250 268.997750 it's uh yeah and you know i suppose of our television we with our cable system we get uh three Detroit stations and we've got three Saskatchewan stations with
sw4196B-ms98-a-0042 268.997750 273.283875 uh yes we do we also have CNN which
sw4196B-ms98-a-0043 273.283875 284.481375 yes uh yeah i- i actually i really enjoy their format and so it is it can be quite informative on an international basis uh
sw4196B-ms98-a-0044 284.481375 292.489500 so um i guess that would probably be my primary source for international news but uh not on a
sw4196B-ms98-a-0045 292.489500 299.458000 regular prescribed basis tend to uh or i happen to be there and i'm and uh
