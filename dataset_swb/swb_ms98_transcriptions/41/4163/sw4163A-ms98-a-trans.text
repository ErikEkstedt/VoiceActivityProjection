sw4163A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.339000 [noise]
sw4163A-ms98-a-0002 0.339000 6.846875 it seems to me that the the benefits of working for a big company tend to be the the same things that that are to their determent
sw4163A-ms98-a-0003 6.846875 14.200000 um they aren't as as responsive both to like bad economic times you don't have to worry about your job all of a sudden disappearing
sw4163A-ms98-a-0004 14.200000 21.991500 but when you see a job when you see a a job that needs to be done sometimes you have to fill out the five forms in triplicate in order to to get it done you know what i mean
sw4163A-ms98-a-0005 21.991500 26.151250 [silence]
sw4163A-ms98-a-0006 26.151250 27.675000 oh wow
sw4163A-ms98-a-0007 27.675000 42.096000 [silence]
sw4163A-ms98-a-0008 42.096000 43.478625 right
sw4163A-ms98-a-0009 43.478625 51.366125 [silence]
sw4163A-ms98-a-0010 51.366125 64.396625 there is that i mean well and then i guess again i- i gue[ss]- like i said when i when i started off that the advantages tend to be the same things that the disadvantages i mean if i don't show up for for work there's probably somebody else that could fill my spot but
sw4163A-ms98-a-0011 64.396625 70.505375 um i imagine and and that's nice but uh it's w[ould]- it's also nice to be able to uh
sw4163A-ms98-a-0012 70.505375 77.927500 know that that you are the person that that makes things get done you know if if you're not there it doesn't happen
sw4163A-ms98-a-0013 77.927500 81.949375 [silence]
sw4163A-ms98-a-0014 81.949375 83.216125 yeah
sw4163A-ms98-a-0015 83.216125 88.657250 [silence]
sw4163A-ms98-a-0016 88.657250 92.449375 oh wow oh wow

sw4163A-ms98-a-0018 96.664500 98.300000 um-hum
sw4163A-ms98-a-0019 98.300000 107.497625 you know one other benefit that tha[t]- just occurred to me i didn't take it as much advantage of it at least not yet in [noise] sometimes big companies will pay for like education
sw4163A-ms98-a-0020 107.497625 118.348375 i had some friends of mine uh get sent up to Stanford for a year for uh college or for like for grad school and i guess getting stuck in California for the summer is is not such a bad thing
sw4163A-ms98-a-0021 118.348375 120.097000 you know but uh
sw4163A-ms98-a-0022 120.097000 121.766750 [silence]
sw4163A-ms98-a-0023 121.766750 123.079500 uh-huh
sw4163A-ms98-a-0024 123.079500 131.341000 [silence]
sw4163A-ms98-a-0025 131.341000 132.688000 uh-huh
sw4163A-ms98-a-0026 132.688000 134.085000 [silence]
sw4163A-ms98-a-0027 134.085000 135.572875 yeah
sw4163A-ms98-a-0028 135.572875 136.990625 [silence]
sw4163A-ms98-a-0029 136.990625 139.418000 [laughter]
sw4163A-ms98-a-0030 139.418000 140.262750 yeah
sw4163A-ms98-a-0031 140.262750 151.383875 yeah but i would think that a a smaller company you would have a i mean if if if a small company hits some niche in the some niche market that that it is uniquely qualified to
sw4163A-ms98-a-0032 151.383875 155.626875 um take care of it has a chance to to grow really fast
sw4163A-ms98-a-0033 155.626875 165.860000 and if you can get on top of it before before it goes up i mean you know if all of a sudden the company expanded to like you know three thousand people you would probably be one of the top people
sw4163A-ms98-a-0034 165.860000 173.336875 of course i guess if there's only the two of you you'll i mean i guess y[ou're]- you're one of the top two people but you are also in the bottom half so
sw4163A-ms98-a-0035 173.336875 180.516250 so uh um the only other thing i can think of is uh uh stuff for 
sw4163A-ms98-a-0036 180.516250 181.689000 [silence]
sw4163A-ms98-a-0037 181.689000 187.560500 things like uh like if if there's some kind of child care if if someone were married and had kids
sw4163A-ms98-a-0038 187.560500 190.007500 [noise] bigger companies might have something like that
sw4163A-ms98-a-0039 190.007500 191.022500 [silence]
sw4163A-ms98-a-0040 191.022500 200.175375 and uh um [noise] like like it's their i guess another advantage might be that uh if th[ey]- if it's big a big enough company and it has multiple sites
sw4163A-ms98-a-0041 200.175375 206.946625 um if you wanted to you could stay with the same company and decide you wanted to live in another part of the country

sw4163A-ms98-a-0045 231.910500 239.900375 [vocalized-noise] which i guess i being with a small company you wouldn't get forced to move but do you think uh do you think it was good to to move around or not
sw4163A-ms98-a-0046 239.900375 255.619875 [silence]
sw4163A-ms98-a-0047 255.619875 258.063625 oh you had family in San Antonio

sw4163A-ms98-a-0052 270.986000 278.331750 [noise] see i'm trying to decide my dad was in the military which is i guess if you figure companies the military would be a pretty big company
sw4163A-ms98-a-0053 278.331750 283.438250 [laughter] a number of people but uh although it's getting smaller every every day um
sw4163A-ms98-a-0054 283.438250 289.555000 and we moved like oh man we used to move like every every three years at least
sw4163A-ms98-a-0055 289.555000 291.363750 and like i don't know
sw4163A-ms98-a-0056 291.363750 297.379250 i mean there's well there's i i've kept in touch with some people from college but but i don't i mean i don't really know
