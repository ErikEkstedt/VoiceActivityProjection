sw4151A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 5.026875 [noise] do you ever think that there's a crime that's just so heinous and so bad that the person
sw4151A-ms98-a-0002 5.026875 8.548625 who commits this crime just doesn't deserve to live anymore

sw4151A-ms98-a-0005 43.506875 52.557125 [silence]
sw4151A-ms98-a-0006 52.557125 64.198500 of the statements made by people against the the death penalty um i I like the statement made by uh Cuomo Cuomo i I believe is um he's he's governor of New York but uh he's
sw4151A-ms98-a-0007 64.198500 66.342125 against the death penalty
sw4151A-ms98-a-0008 66.342125 78.489250 but um he said that he would he would want to to seriously hurt or if not kill someone if if they did something to his wife and that's but but even even in that circum[stance]- in that uh
sw4151A-ms98-a-0009 78.489250 84.651625 uh situation he would be he would hope that there would be people around him who would uh
sw4151A-ms98-a-0010 84.651625 87.662500 keep him from [laughter] doing the doing tho[se]- things
sw4151A-ms98-a-0011 87.662500 98.012375 [silence]
sw4151A-ms98-a-0012 98.012375 99.796000 right exactly

sw4151A-ms98-a-0016 155.667625 156.996000 yeah
sw4151A-ms98-a-0017 156.996000 164.440625 [silence]
sw4151A-ms98-a-0018 164.440625 175.147750 see i don't think a decision's ever gonna be made on dea[th]- on the death penalty until we decide what our prison system is intended to do are they reformatories where we're trying to take people who
sw4151A-ms98-a-0019 175.147750 183.666750 can't survive or or that that aren't conforming enough to society so that that we work well together or are they is it a penal
sw4151A-ms98-a-0020 183.666750 192.082875 institution is it de[signed]- is it designed for punishment um the death penalty surely fits in well with uh in a penal situation where you're trying to punish
sw4151A-ms98-a-0021 192.082875 201.958625 um perhaps not in the manner that we do it but but it it in in theory it fits in in reform[atory]- system in a reformatory
sw4151A-ms98-a-0022 201.958625 207.512375 i mean [laughter] if you if you put someone to death y[ou]- you obviously can't reform [laughter-them] 
sw4151A-ms98-a-0023 207.512375 208.962125 yeah
sw4151A-ms98-a-0024 208.962125 240.734000 [silence]

sw4151A-ms98-a-0027 244.185875 256.147625 i don't think it's done i don't think we run it as a deterrent i mean people say that but i mean if it was really a deterrent i mean i think like horse thieves in the old west you know they saw other horse thieves
sw4151A-ms98-a-0028 256.147625 260.980625 hanging by their necks every once in a while and
sw4151A-ms98-a-0029 260.980625 267.376625 if we really wa[nt]- if it was really seriously gonna be a de[terrent]- deterrent i would think that it would be public i mean i don't think it would be
sw4151A-ms98-a-0030 267.376625 275.913000 this private thing because nobody ever nobody ever sees it if someone ever if you know like say some young kids or something like that that that might be inclined more towards the life of crime
sw4151A-ms98-a-0031 275.913000 286.246875 had to sit and watch and and see a guy burn or or you know something or shot by firing squad or something like that i would think you'd make a bigger impact on their life rather than
sw4151A-ms98-a-0032 286.246875 289.578500 you know telling them that there's there's protestors out here
sw4151A-ms98-a-0033 289.578500 291.469375 at the you know
