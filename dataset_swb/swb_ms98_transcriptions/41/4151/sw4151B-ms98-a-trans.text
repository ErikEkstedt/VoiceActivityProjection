sw4151B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.553875 [noise]
sw4151B-ms98-a-0002 0.553875 9.031625 [silence]
sw4151B-ms98-a-0003 9.031625 16.031125 that's a good question uh [noise] there would be a point there was a point where i would have said
sw4151B-ms98-a-0004 16.031125 26.681125 know that no one would deserve to die for for a crime that he committed but uh since i've become a parent and since i've
sw4151B-ms98-a-0005 26.681125 31.670000 seen uh things like Jeffrey Dahlmer i really have to question that
sw4151B-ms98-a-0006 31.670000 36.252625 i really uh i i can't conceive of
sw4151B-ms98-a-0007 36.252625 38.360500 someone being that
sw4151B-ms98-a-0008 38.360500 42.781000 brutal to that many other people
sw4151B-ms98-a-0009 42.781000 44.439500 and uh
sw4151B-ms98-a-0010 44.439500 45.629625 [silence]
sw4151B-ms98-a-0011 45.629625 49.929625 try and figure out what would be a suitable punishment
sw4151B-ms98-a-0012 49.929625 51.629250 uh
sw4151B-ms98-a-0013 51.629250 87.847500 [silence]
sw4151B-ms98-a-0014 87.847500 98.568500 oh it's a uh it's a question of your your gut reactions to something like that versus an intelligent reason response
sw4151B-ms98-a-0015 98.568500 108.518875 uh a[nd]- and that was the thing that uh killed Dukakis back uh four years ago when someone asked him a similar question and he
sw4151B-ms98-a-0016 108.518875 118.757000 he thought for a second and gave a thoughtful well reasoned reply when uh people wanted to see if he was going to go for an emotion
sw4151B-ms98-a-0017 118.757000 127.919500 a a gut level reaction and i think that the people who are strongly in favor of the death penalty
sw4151B-ms98-a-0018 127.919500 131.909375 are really working from that gut level
sw4151B-ms98-a-0019 131.909375 142.091500 uh you know whether it be a biblical force uh you know the eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth a life for a knife life type logic
sw4151B-ms98-a-0020 142.091500 147.208875 or just uh uh some sort of anger at
sw4151B-ms98-a-0021 147.208875 156.107125 putting peo[ple]- putting uh murderers up in federal pens for the rest of their life uh while we foot the bill
sw4151B-ms98-a-0022 156.107125 164.623125 i think people are are working at that from more of a uh a gut reaction than a a reasoned humane one
sw4151B-ms98-a-0023 164.623125 204.905625 [silence]
sw4151B-ms98-a-0024 204.905625 206.688375 [laughter]
sw4151B-ms98-a-0025 206.688375 208.751375 that's true
sw4151B-ms98-a-0026 208.751375 215.832375 uh the the other argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent
sw4151B-ms98-a-0027 215.832375 228.562125 and i really don't uh agree with that i don't think anyone who would commit a uh a crime that would get them the death penalty
sw4151B-ms98-a-0028 228.562125 232.308875 would stop at the moment and say
sw4151B-ms98-a-0029 232.308875 244.561750 well i was about to kill and dismember this person but ooh if they catch me they're going to kill me so i better not do it i i just don't think that uh that it works that way
sw4151B-ms98-a-0030 244.561750 257.006000 [silence]
sw4151B-ms98-a-0031 257.006000 258.333500 um-hum
sw4151B-ms98-a-0032 258.333500 290.519750 [silence]
sw4151B-ms98-a-0033 290.519750 299.042000 well i I don't know if that would really work that way or not uh there's a lot of violence
