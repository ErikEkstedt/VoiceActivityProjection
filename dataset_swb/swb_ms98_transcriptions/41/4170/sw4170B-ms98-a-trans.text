sw4170B-ms98-a-0003 7.238250 12.687500 i agree i'm particularly worried about Social Security since i'm at the
sw4170B-ms98-a-0004 12.687500 17.894125 end of the baby boomer generation and there's not gonna be any money left when i get through
sw4170B-ms98-a-0005 17.894125 30.006375 so i kind of feel like i'm supporting a lot of people and that it's just gonna go into a hole [laughter] i don't think that i'm gonna get anything out of it when the time comes from
sw4170B-ms98-a-0006 30.006375 31.846375 [noise] it
sw4170B-ms98-a-0007 31.846375 34.147000 other than that yeah

sw4170B-ms98-a-0011 46.086125 54.284375 right everybody there's not gonna be enough people to support us when we get our age [noise] up that way but
sw4170B-ms98-a-0012 54.284375 56.297875 we'll be supporting
sw4170B-ms98-a-0013 56.297875 66.451625 we're they're we're a lot of people right now supporting a few people and then when the time comes and it's a few people supporting a lot of people it's not gonna even out very fairly
sw4170B-ms98-a-0014 66.451625 74.353875 that way i don't have to i don't worry about the other i don't have state taxes really because_1 i'm from Texas so
sw4170B-ms98-a-0015 74.353875 84.138500 i'm happy with that [laughter] i'm worried about it though because_1 every year they sit there and try to put more taxes in you know
sw4170B-ms98-a-0016 84.138500 89.954875 and they're trying to get property tax in our county [laughter] but
sw4170B-ms98-a-0017 89.954875 102.878125 [silence]
sw4170B-ms98-a-0018 102.878125 104.782625 [noise] yeah
sw4170B-ms98-a-0019 104.782625 110.359250 there's so much administration and nothing [noise] when it when it comes right down to it
sw4170B-ms98-a-0020 110.359250 116.465625 the overhead is it g[et]- everything gets eaten up in overhead and doesn't actually [noise] d[o]- do much
sw4170B-ms98-a-0021 116.465625 126.112500 [silence]
sw4170B-ms98-a-0022 126.112500 135.919500 yeah i was thinking the other day you know it was like no taxation without representation and so long ago and now we're just eaten alive by
sw4170B-ms98-a-0023 135.919500 144.189375 all this government that can't pay for itself and goes into debt more and more and more and more and we don't have much say about it
sw4170B-ms98-a-0024 144.189375 149.828625 and the government doesn't seem to do a [noise] be doing a whole lot of things i like either
sw4170B-ms98-a-0025 149.828625 151.333250 they're going
sw4170B-ms98-a-0026 151.333250 166.033125 [silence]
sw4170B-ms98-a-0027 166.033125 176.127375 [noise] yeah and then this National Endowment for the Arts thing where they they put pornography up in the in the name of art you know
sw4170B-ms98-a-0028 176.127375 178.812500 and make me pay for it [laughter]
sw4170B-ms98-a-0029 178.812500 191.387125 my you know i- i don't exactly appreciate that either i really get frustrated when government starts to do things that are immoral and then expect me to support them on it
sw4170B-ms98-a-0030 191.387125 201.712500 first you get to the point where it's like you feel like protesting by not paying just to make [noise] them understand that they can't do this just because_1 you know it's our money they're using
sw4170B-ms98-a-0031 201.712500 206.514875 for it they can't just think well it's ours now we got it we can do what we want with it
sw4170B-ms98-a-0032 206.514875 214.687375 it says that i'm standing it it says i approve if i sit there and pay it and i get kind of upset about that
sw4170B-ms98-a-0033 214.687375 241.163125 [silence]
sw4170B-ms98-a-0034 241.163125 243.139875 well that's good
sw4170B-ms98-a-0035 243.139875 246.478750 [noise] yeah you start to feel real powerless
sw4170B-ms98-a-0036 246.478750 255.946125 but on the other hand at least we're [noise] we're powerless in a lot of ways but then there's so many other countries that i'm glad i'm not in 
sw4170B-ms98-a-0037 255.946125 270.049750 [noise] you know it seems to me like the minute you starting putting in any radical changes in anything you end up with something like um Liberia or [laughter] uh Czechoslovakia you know i mean it seems like
sw4170B-ms98-a-0038 270.049750 275.952375 i'd rather try to work from inside the system to change something than to throw away what we've got now
sw4170B-ms98-a-0039 275.952375 281.140750 it would be pretty frightening the other way around it's kind of scary now seeing the way
sw4170B-ms98-a-0040 281.140750 283.449625 they're going over there
sw4170B-ms98-a-0041 283.449625 297.762000 [silence]
