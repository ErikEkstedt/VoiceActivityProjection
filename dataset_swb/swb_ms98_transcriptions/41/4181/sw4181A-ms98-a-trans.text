sw4181A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.241375 [noise]
sw4181A-ms98-a-0002 0.241375 2.048625 i don't think anybody pays too little
sw4181A-ms98-a-0003 2.048625 8.542375 [silence]
sw4181A-ms98-a-0004 8.542375 11.007875 do you get hit up for local taxes there
sw4181A-ms98-a-0005 11.007875 20.956250 [silence]
sw4181A-ms98-a-0006 20.956250 23.498375 oh so y[ou]- y[ou]- you get the whole smorgasbord
sw4181A-ms98-a-0007 23.498375 26.187625 well i- i actually live in New Hampshire
sw4181A-ms98-a-0008 26.187625 28.721875 tax free or die uh-huh
sw4181A-ms98-a-0009 28.721875 31.951250 [silence]
sw4181A-ms98-a-0010 31.951250 34.960000 no actually there's no sales tax in New Hampshire either
sw4181A-ms98-a-0011 34.960000 39.336375 no what there is is very high property taxes because that's how they fund schools and everything
sw4181A-ms98-a-0012 39.336375 44.814875 the only problem is i work in Massachusetts so they they hit me up for the five percent there
sw4181A-ms98-a-0013 44.814875 51.683625 yep but it well you know we i[t's]- it's only a state taxes no local we've got a five percent sales tax
sw4181A-ms98-a-0014 51.683625 59.549750 but um the problem is that so i'm paying state tax even though i don't live here but at least on things like stock options and things like that they don't tax me
sw4181A-ms98-a-0015 59.549750 61.517625 so that's not too bad
sw4181A-ms98-a-0016 61.517625 88.945750 [silence]
sw4181A-ms98-a-0017 88.945750 99.789000 yeah oh i- i- i mean i- i'd consider twenty percent lucky because just on i mean you know when you figure out just on feds you know i actually hit the thirty one bracket this year which was no fun [vocalized-noise]
sw4181A-ms98-a-0018 99.789000 103.942875 right and also you know then you figure out seven or eight percent for FICA
sw4181A-ms98-a-0019 103.942875 114.805125 which is taxes where you [vocalized-noise] most people forget about them_1 because you've g[ot]- you know you can't always get your FICA back at the end of the year but so you know and then you know like a five percent FICA i'm paying forty percent tax
sw4181A-ms98-a-0020 114.805125 122.025875 [silence]
sw4181A-ms98-a-0021 122.025875 127.408000 yeah well i- i mean i think there's some people there y[ou]- there clearly are some things where you need infrastructure and you need
sw4181A-ms98-a-0022 127.408000 131.945500 you kn[ow]- you know there are things government does better you know i think government does a better space program
sw4181A-ms98-a-0023 131.945500 134.254500 than you're gonna get out of private individuals but
sw4181A-ms98-a-0024 134.254500 142.330875 you know i think you know you look at things like you know tax subsidies to tobacco farmers because Jesse Helms wants it that way or
sw4181A-ms98-a-0025 142.330875 149.154125 you know and and just tremendous amounts of you know so much of it is now just going to service debt or you know is going in
sw4181A-ms98-a-0026 149.154125 160.408250 into into programs that you know yeah they are they are fat you know i think the military is really fat i think that a lot of the the HEW services although they're providing necessary services have too much fat in them_1
sw4181A-ms98-a-0027 160.408250 168.576875 [silence]
sw4181A-ms98-a-0028 168.576875 169.996250 you know like we we
sw4181A-ms98-a-0029 169.996250 171.211875 um
sw4181A-ms98-a-0030 171.211875 174.607375 yeah i mean we we spend a fortune for things like VA hospitals
sw4181A-ms98-a-0031 174.607375 181.993625 and you know then you look at how well they're managed you know i don't think we're getting our money's work out worth out of there i think it's all going into into bureaucrats
sw4181A-ms98-a-0032 181.993625 191.441875 [silence]
sw4181A-ms98-a-0033 191.441875 192.653125 [vocalized-noise]
sw4181A-ms98-a-0034 192.653125 212.335875 [silence]
sw4181A-ms98-a-0035 212.335875 215.538375 well be[tween]- between between him and Reagan yeah
sw4181A-ms98-a-0036 215.538375 217.512375 the great communicator
sw4181A-ms98-a-0037 217.512375 224.089375 [silence]
sw4181A-ms98-a-0038 224.089375 226.413625 oh oh yeah they think
sw4181A-ms98-a-0039 226.413625 230.636500 oh yeah and then they go and say and that Con[gress]- Congress they're the fault for it 
sw4181A-ms98-a-0040 230.636500 240.766625 but you know the other thing is it's tricky though because like in New Hampshire they say oh all right let's cut the military budget well yeah then you lose half your jobs in New Hampshire you lose Grotten Connecticut goes so you know it's like
sw4181A-ms98-a-0041 240.766625 249.487625 you know it's very tricky to balance that stuff off because then you hurt you know if the if those if people lose their jobs then they become a load and they're not contributing taxes 
sw4181A-ms98-a-0042 249.487625 253.995625 so you know it's it's very hard to say you know this is what we should cut
sw4181A-ms98-a-0043 253.995625 259.006750 [silence]
sw4181A-ms98-a-0044 259.006750 260.113750 yes
sw4181A-ms98-a-0045 260.113750 266.988500 [silence]
sw4181A-ms98-a-0046 266.988500 269.121875 who who aren't contributing right yeah
sw4181A-ms98-a-0047 269.121875 270.873500 [silence]
sw4181A-ms98-a-0048 270.873500 272.621375 and uh in our
sw4181A-ms98-a-0049 272.621375 273.639000 [silence]
sw4181A-ms98-a-0050 273.639000 274.457000 right
sw4181A-ms98-a-0051 274.457000 275.101625 [noise]
sw4181A-ms98-a-0052 275.101625 277.383250 but what's very funny is in our town meeting
sw4181A-ms98-a-0053 277.383250 290.198500 they were vo[ting]- th[is]- this this guy had both for our school district meeting and our town meeting had this proposal which unfortunately violates New Hampshire constitution [noise] for our local town to do it to uh have you have people line item their taxes
sw4181A-ms98-a-0054 290.198500 292.971125 they say i want to pay for this and this and this and this and this
sw4181A-ms98-a-0055 292.971125 297.198125 course the only problem with that is then nobody pays for the necessary services that they don't use
sw4181A-ms98-a-0056 297.198125 298.207000 [silence]
sw4181A-ms98-a-0057 298.207000 298.626000 yeah
