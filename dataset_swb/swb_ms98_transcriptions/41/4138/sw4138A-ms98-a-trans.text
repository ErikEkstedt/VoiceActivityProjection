sw4138A-ms98-a-0003 1.923875 11.696750 [silence]
sw4138A-ms98-a-0004 11.696750 13.470500 you spend what you have and
sw4138A-ms98-a-0005 13.470500 15.511500 [silence]
sw4138A-ms98-a-0006 15.511500 17.401000 yeah i think that
sw4138A-ms98-a-0007 17.401000 20.889500 the general idea is to s[pend]- you know spend uh
sw4138A-ms98-a-0008 20.889500 28.568750 during a time of recession that you know for the deficit spending to help pick up the economy but they're running under the assump[tion]- you know
sw4138A-ms98-a-0009 28.568750 41.287625 the way they're running it now they're h[ave]- you know running it under a deficit spending you know while we're not under a recession so there's never any surplus coming in to counter the deficit that we're running so
sw4138A-ms98-a-0010 41.287625 49.880250 that's kind of a basic thing of economics i guess keep spending keep going into debt you're not going to payoff what you owe
sw4138A-ms98-a-0011 49.880250 58.062750 so i guess the the question was more like uh do you get what you pay f[or]- you know get what you pay for
sw4138A-ms98-a-0012 58.062750 72.156500 [silence]
