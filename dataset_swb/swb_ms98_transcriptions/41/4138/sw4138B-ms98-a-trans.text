sw4138B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 2.151625 [noise]
sw4138B-ms98-a-0002 2.151625 12.523875 well i think they're a necessary evil uh i wish the government would operate on the same premise that uh businesses operate on and that is uh
sw4138B-ms98-a-0003 12.523875 17.366125 you you don't spend more than you than you bring in
sw4138B-ms98-a-0004 17.366125 58.403750 [silence]
sw4138B-ms98-a-0005 58.403750 72.561125 well i it just depends uh uh roads are very expensive uh commodity and so is uh utilities they supply and police and fire department uh you know they need to make a living
sw4138B-ms98-a-0006 72.561125 83.285875 [laughter-so] i think for for for many years uh we've paid teachers and police officers and firemen who are uh to a great extent public servants
sw4138B-ms98-a-0007 83.285875 88.450125 uh we have not paid them really what they're worth in what they contribute to society
sw4138B-ms98-a-0008 88.450125 96.106375 but uh then again uh it's the hard to justify with all the wastefulness of money that
sw4138B-ms98-a-0009 96.106375 105.013250 the government spends on all levels of of uh government including municipalities as well as state and federal governments
sw4138B-ms98-a-0010 105.013250 148.632250 [silence]
sw4138B-ms98-a-0011 148.632250 157.746250 uh you're very fortunate [laughter] we just try not to pay any more in than we have to uh we pay in a substantial amount uh
sw4138B-ms98-a-0012 157.746250 168.825500 we don't regret paying taxes we do think that uh sometimes uh we have a reverse of a regressive tax a progressive tax
sw4138B-ms98-a-0013 168.825500 178.205750 and progressive tax i think uh does not give people incentive to make more money [noise] and what i mean by that the more income you make the more tax you pay
sw4138B-ms98-a-0014 178.205750 184.655750 it should be i think a flat percentage and uh that percentage ought to be an equitable amount
sw4138B-ms98-a-0015 184.655750 188.968875 uh last year when they passed the tax laws for the
sw4138B-ms98-a-0016 188.968875 193.841375 nineteen ninety ninety one whatever nineteen ninety one
sw4138B-ms98-a-0017 193.841375 204.279000 uh i added up all the taxes that we were going to pay on all these different specific luxury items and travel expenses and everything else
sw4138B-ms98-a-0018 204.279000 210.715750 and i totaled them all up and basically uh we were going to be paying seventy or eighty percent tax
sw4138B-ms98-a-0019 210.715750 215.235500 now that was the assumption that you spent that same dollar for every
sw4138B-ms98-a-0020 215.235500 217.438125 for every item on there
sw4138B-ms98-a-0021 217.438125 220.501375 even though there's uh taxes on different things
sw4138B-ms98-a-0022 220.501375 228.754125 but you know there's f[ederal]- there's a lot of taxes you pay that you're not even aware of that you're paying uh like when you buy a tire you pay a federal excise tax
sw4138B-ms98-a-0023 228.754125 230.901875 [silence]
sw4138B-ms98-a-0024 230.901875 235.519250 you pay gasoline taxes every time you pump something into your your tank
sw4138B-ms98-a-0025 235.519250 242.592125 [silence]
sw4138B-ms98-a-0026 242.592125 246.200125 but you probably pay more percentage wise in other taxes
sw4138B-ms98-a-0027 246.200125 259.025250 [silence]
sw4138B-ms98-a-0028 259.025250 267.710125 if you impl[emented]- implemented a flat percentage it would encourage people uh to make more money and the what
sw4138B-ms98-a-0029 267.710125 279.571625 people need to understand in my opinion now this is just my opinion okay uh is that businesses create jobs and jobs create income and income pays taxes
sw4138B-ms98-a-0030 279.571625 289.412000 and so if they penalize businesses business people are smart enough to say here's my break point i'm not going to work any harder and make any more or create any more jobs
sw4138B-ms98-a-0031 289.412000 294.456750 and so based on that who do you think you're talking to you're talking to an employer
sw4138B-ms98-a-0032 294.456750 299.458000 [laughter]
