sw4129B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.504250 [noise]
sw4129B-ms98-a-0002 0.504250 2.859000 [silence]
sw4129B-ms98-a-0003 2.859000 10.614875 i have ambivalent feelings because i don't think it serves as a kind of deterrent we would like to think it is
sw4129B-ms98-a-0004 10.614875 18.677375 but on the other hand it is very very expensive to maintain you know Texas has one of the biggest criminal justice systems in the country
sw4129B-ms98-a-0005 18.677375 21.703125 and it's eating us alive budget wise
sw4129B-ms98-a-0006 21.703125 23.748250 and um
sw4129B-ms98-a-0007 23.748250 25.390375 [silence]
sw4129B-ms98-a-0008 25.390375 38.194125 yes we do practice capital punishment but the nature of the uh courts and the appeals and the stays and all that means that it's a very long haul before anybody's ever executed
sw4129B-ms98-a-0009 38.194125 39.958125 [silence]
sw4129B-ms98-a-0010 39.958125 51.228125 yeah and then i was reading in the paper just this morning it's interesting because_1 i had forgotten i guess that i wrote this little topic down that it costs more to execute somebody tha[n]- than it does to keep them_1
sw4129B-ms98-a-0011 51.228125 54.981000 because of all the costs of the appeals and all that you know
sw4129B-ms98-a-0012 54.981000 60.994625 [silence]
sw4129B-ms98-a-0013 60.994625 63.895250 well i think capital punishment is supposed to be
sw4129B-ms98-a-0014 63.895250 67.334125 primarily a deterrent to other people
sw4129B-ms98-a-0015 67.334125 68.336750 [silence]
sw4129B-ms98-a-0016 68.336750 69.812250 you know who would see it
sw4129B-ms98-a-0017 69.812250 71.003125 [silence]
sw4129B-ms98-a-0018 71.003125 73.847750 yeah but i'm not sure
sw4129B-ms98-a-0019 73.847750 75.775000 how successful that is
sw4129B-ms98-a-0020 75.775000 81.113625 [silence]
sw4129B-ms98-a-0021 81.113625 83.107250 quicker maybe yeah
sw4129B-ms98-a-0022 83.107250 84.927250 [silence]
sw4129B-ms98-a-0023 84.927250 86.317750 um-hum
sw4129B-ms98-a-0024 86.317750 88.663500 [silence]
sw4129B-ms98-a-0025 88.663500 90.586500 what what kind of work do you do
sw4129B-ms98-a-0026 90.586500 94.203000 [silence]
sw4129B-ms98-a-0027 94.203000 97.227375 hum well see i'm a school principal
sw4129B-ms98-a-0028 97.227375 99.115625 elementary school
sw4129B-ms98-a-0029 99.115625 105.768250 and in a very poor section of town with pr[edominantly]- predominantly Anglo kids
sw4129B-ms98-a-0030 105.768250 111.458625 and i see kids already that are gonna be criminals
sw4129B-ms98-a-0031 111.458625 114.256625 in spite of everything we can do
sw4129B-ms98-a-0032 114.256625 120.447875 and see i'm afraid i think if we would take the equivalent amount of money and invest it in young people
sw4129B-ms98-a-0033 120.447875 121.479750 [silence]
sw4129B-ms98-a-0034 121.479750 125.744125 that i mean course you couldn't do that because_1 you got to do something with the ones that are already there
sw4129B-ms98-a-0035 125.744125 129.970625 but i think if we would make a bigger investment in kids
sw4129B-ms98-a-0036 129.970625 133.925875 we'd have fewer decisions to make
sw4129B-ms98-a-0037 133.925875 135.513000 [silence]
sw4129B-ms98-a-0038 135.513000 137.390500 down the road you know
sw4129B-ms98-a-0039 137.390500 138.995375 oh yeah
sw4129B-ms98-a-0040 138.995375 140.277250 [silence]
sw4129B-ms98-a-0041 140.277250 143.612500 well i'm not talking about_1 just in the school system
sw4129B-ms98-a-0042 143.612500 146.238625 see i'm talking about_1 like in in uh
sw4129B-ms98-a-0043 146.238625 150.560125 i'm afraid i think that there are kids who just ought to be taken out of their homes
sw4129B-ms98-a-0044 150.560125 151.930250 and
sw4129B-ms98-a-0045 151.930250 153.331125 reared
sw4129B-ms98-a-0046 153.331125 164.235500 uh i know institutions don't work that well but it's a bad day [laughter-because_1] [laughter-because_1] i have all these kids through my office i have a school of five hundred and thirty seven kids
sw4129B-ms98-a-0047 164.235500 169.867000 five hundred of them_1 are good solid kids and i have the same thirty seven in my office every day
sw4129B-ms98-a-0048 169.867000 172.844750 and a lot of their parents are totally irresponsible
sw4129B-ms98-a-0049 172.844750 174.068375 [silence]
sw4129B-ms98-a-0050 174.068375 176.003125 some of them_1 in the penal system
sw4129B-ms98-a-0051 176.003125 177.423625 [silence]
sw4129B-ms98-a-0052 177.423625 185.913875 and you know you just see those kids going down the road now not all of them_1 will commit offenses that have to do with capital punishment but some of them_1 have already been in youth centers
sw4129B-ms98-a-0053 185.913875 186.953750 [silence]
sw4129B-ms98-a-0054 186.953750 192.913750 and that kind of thing and if we had something to do before they get to be full blown adult criminals
sw4129B-ms98-a-0055 192.913750 193.957375 [silence]
sw4129B-ms98-a-0056 193.957375 200.381500 and i'm not talking about_1 necessarily in the school system i'm not sure that the school system should be the agent of all the social action
sw4129B-ms98-a-0057 200.381500 203.663875 i think that's one reason we have problems in school sys[tems]-
sw4129B-ms98-a-0058 203.663875 209.538125 uh and some of them_1 are our problems but a lot of it's because everything society wants we're supposed to do
sw4129B-ms98-a-0059 209.538125 211.381750 [silence]
sw4129B-ms98-a-0060 211.381750 213.637125 but that's another subject but
sw4129B-ms98-a-0061 213.637125 217.310000 anyway i dealt with two or three kids today that are gonna end up
sw4129B-ms98-a-0062 217.310000 219.968125 where somebody has to make a decision what to do with them_1
sw4129B-ms98-a-0063 219.968125 224.452625 [silence]
sw4129B-ms98-a-0064 224.452625 227.988625 um-hum i don't i don't know that there is an easy solution but
sw4129B-ms98-a-0065 227.988625 229.055500 [silence]
sw4129B-ms98-a-0066 229.055500 233.226500 if you could find a way to prevent some of it and i'm not sure what it would be
sw4129B-ms98-a-0067 233.226500 234.234875 [silence]
sw4129B-ms98-a-0068 234.234875 236.364875 it would be money better spent
sw4129B-ms98-a-0069 236.364875 242.523750 than do you know it costs more to keep an inmate on death row than it does to send a kid to Harvard
sw4129B-ms98-a-0070 242.523750 244.540875 that's true
sw4129B-ms98-a-0071 244.540875 246.891000 statistically that's true
sw4129B-ms98-a-0072 246.891000 249.412625 [silence]
sw4129B-ms98-a-0073 249.412625 250.620250 um-hum
sw4129B-ms98-a-0074 250.620250 251.623375 [silence]
sw4129B-ms98-a-0075 251.623375 253.077625 are you for it
sw4129B-ms98-a-0076 253.077625 254.180125 [silence]
sw4129B-ms98-a-0077 254.180125 257.629750 i'm for it in in some cases yeah
sw4129B-ms98-a-0078 257.629750 260.731500 what kind of crimes would you do use it for
sw4129B-ms98-a-0079 260.731500 262.234000 [silence]
sw4129B-ms98-a-0080 262.234000 263.597625 um-hum

sw4129B-ms98-a-0082 269.838500 274.997000 i- i would consider it for sexual abuse of children
sw4129B-ms98-a-0083 274.997000 276.797500 on going
sw4129B-ms98-a-0084 276.797500 280.627000 you know not one instance but perpetual abusers of children
sw4129B-ms98-a-0085 280.627000 285.191625 [silence]
sw4129B-ms98-a-0086 285.191625 287.899750 well you know somebody elected that recently

sw4129B-ms98-a-0088 290.465500 294.190750 and all the civil rights people are up in arms about it you know

sw4129B-ms98-a-0090 295.362125 296.839500 but uh
