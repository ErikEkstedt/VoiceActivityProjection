sw4146B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 2.984375 [noise] you want to start or should i start
sw4146B-ms98-a-0002 2.984375 15.496500 okay let's see uh i think that uh i- i think that trials by jury are a good idea i just think the concept of multiple attempts
sw4146B-ms98-a-0003 15.496500 25.330000 uh [laughter-at] trial is wh[en]- uh with when they're always saying oh well uh uh i want to appeal i want to appeal i want to appeal i
sw4146B-ms98-a-0004 25.330000 34.277250 i think multiple appeal is what our real problem is it's not the not the the twelve man jury trials uh
sw4146B-ms98-a-0005 34.277250 40.345375 think that that i- i would not be totally adverse to the concept of of uh
sw4146B-ms98-a-0006 40.345375 53.850375 of uh i guess uh uh judge trials either uh i think our our we have a real big problem with litigation we we spend too much of our time litigation in our legal system and

sw4146B-ms98-a-0011 132.287250 145.397750 um-hum uh trial well one thing is we do not have a trial by peers anymore uh that's that that is g[one]- go[ne]- gone out gone out the door for one thing
sw4146B-ms98-a-0012 145.397750 149.461750 the very first thing a lawyer attempts to do is get an ignorant jury
sw4146B-ms98-a-0013 149.461750 155.996875 [laughter] as part of in fact as part of the process they're not supposed to know anything whatsoever about the trial
sw4146B-ms98-a-0014 155.996875 164.776375 so particular so particularly for famous trials what that indicates is that the only people who are really at that jury are idiots [laughter]
sw4146B-ms98-a-0015 164.776375 165.988500 [silence]
sw4146B-ms98-a-0016 165.988500 174.498000 right only ignorant people and that means low IQ generally [laughter] wherein that's not that's not trial by jury
sw4146B-ms98-a-0017 174.498000 184.719375 now i guess that's that that's become less so i've noted that um uh the last couple times that i've had to go by jury they've actually selected intelligent jurors
sw4146B-ms98-a-0018 184.719375 195.513375 now i- i i'm not so sure that would be true if it were a trial of uh of uh some notor[ious]- no[toriety]- no[toriety]- notoriety
sw4146B-ms98-a-0019 195.513375 208.995125 uh but in the case of the normal trials it's much much harder than it used to be t[o]- than to get out of it so they do try not to let uh excuses get you out of uh trials now
sw4146B-ms98-a-0020 208.995125 212.498875 you can delay it but you can't get out [laughter]
