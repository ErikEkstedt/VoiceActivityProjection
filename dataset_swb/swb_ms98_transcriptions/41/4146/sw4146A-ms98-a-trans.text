sw4146A-ms98-a-0003 1.498250 4.051500 uh yeah you go ahead
sw4146A-ms98-a-0004 4.051500 52.465250 [silence]
sw4146A-ms98-a-0005 52.465250 57.037375 oh yeah it's it's just in[credibly]- incredibly complex uh
sw4146A-ms98-a-0006 57.037375 67.997500 uh i- i don't have any problem with the idea of having the jurors although it is a bit disappointing to see the attorneys manipulate the process by
sw4146A-ms98-a-0007 67.997500 75.999125 uh raising so many objections to jurors so that they can try and get for their client um a jury slanted one way
sw4146A-ms98-a-0008 75.999125 89.242750 or the other i mean you can sit there and dismiss people for for trivial reasons and and that takes up a good deal of time too um the the thing i find sort of disappointing about uh a lot of this is that
sw4146A-ms98-a-0009 89.242750 103.589250 often a judge uh and and you hope you get one that's that's really rational and and looks at uh each case separately you'd like to be able to give them some flexibility to be able to sentence
sw4146A-ms98-a-0010 103.589250 114.987875 uh if it's a really awful crime to really put the person away for a long time uh or if there's a lot of intent there and it's obvious put them away on the other hand
sw4146A-ms98-a-0011 114.987875 119.003625 you know maybe to to change the sentencing slightly uh
sw4146A-ms98-a-0012 119.003625 133.044250 that you'd like be able to see them give a different kind of punishment uh not necessary community service that's getting a little bit overworked but but but rather some of other sort of of restitution rather than simply putting them_1 away behind bars
sw4146A-ms98-a-0013 133.044250 155.452625 [silence]
sw4146A-ms98-a-0014 155.452625 156.999250 oh yeah
sw4146A-ms98-a-0015 156.999250 163.499750 [silence]
sw4146A-ms98-a-0016 163.499750 164.786625 [laughter]
sw4146A-ms98-a-0017 164.786625 168.493500 people that have been on the moon [laughter]
sw4146A-ms98-a-0018 168.493500 207.999500 [silence]
sw4146A-ms98-a-0019 207.999500 210.754125 oh yes my my
sw4146A-ms98-a-0020 210.754125 221.462000 oh that's that and and that's actually pretty good my my mother recently uh uh had jury duty uh down in in Texas and uh
sw4146A-ms98-a-0021 221.462000 225.599875 the the judge would not hear any excuses i mean from anybody
sw4146A-ms98-a-0022 225.599875 236.827625 uh he didn't care if they had doctor's appointments or anything he said you're you're here in the pool and you're going to serve but when it came time for and and it turned out it was a rape trial
sw4146A-ms98-a-0023 236.827625 248.578875 uh and the uh uh the attorney asked my mother well uh how do you feel about this and she told him quite frankly that she thought that the punishment should be extremely severe for rapist and then
sw4146A-ms98-a-0024 248.578875 257.812000 the guy began to ask um what does your husband do for a living well he's retired Air Force ah was he retired law enforcement Air Force
sw4146A-ms98-a-0025 257.812000 268.048500 they they dismissed her on the grounds that they didn't want her that her husband could have been seen as being in law enforcement even though he was a programmer [laughter] in the Air Force
sw4146A-ms98-a-0026 268.048500 277.496750 they wanted to stay away from anybody that might even have a smidgen of law enforcement so even though she was there to do her duty to serve
sw4146A-ms98-a-0027 277.496750 284.491375 she was dismissed on the grounds that she might possibly remotely have some prejudice and that's
sw4146A-ms98-a-0028 284.491375 298.850000 my mother's fairly well read she didn't actually know about this local case it was of rather small import uh but i would agree with you that that not necessarily does somebody have to be ignorant not to know but they'd have to have met
