sw4105A-ms98-a-0003 30.955375 43.533625 that's true unless it's a large corporation that has a lot of different branches uh it was important for me to pick a job uh to choose a job that
sw4105A-ms98-a-0004 43.533625 49.903500 was in the northeast uh because i like the region and my family is here
sw4105A-ms98-a-0005 49.903500 58.807375 at one point i'd interviewed for a company that wanted to send me to Boise Idaho and that really seemed like a negative benefit to me

sw4105A-ms98-a-0012 137.888000 147.659250 that uh it it will benefit both the employee and the company i work for a firm that does have a very flexible schedule
sw4105A-ms98-a-0013 147.659250 153.173750 and i can't remember the last time that i just worked forty hours a week
