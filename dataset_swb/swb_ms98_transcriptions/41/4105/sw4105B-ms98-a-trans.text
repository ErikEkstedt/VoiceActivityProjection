sw4105B-ms98-a-0003 15.113125 19.413250 a a job benefit at least it had a lot to do with what i chose is
sw4105B-ms98-a-0004 19.413250 28.024375 i[n]- in my job an[d]- an[d]- an[d]- besides uh you know uh i guess uh uh salary and uh the work
sw4105B-ms98-a-0005 28.024375 32.481250 but see those are the things that they can't really do much about [laughter]
sw4105B-ms98-a-0006 32.481250 55.020625 [silence]
sw4105B-ms98-a-0007 55.020625 56.281000 um-hum
sw4105B-ms98-a-0008 56.281000 58.346875 [silence]

sw4105B-ms98-a-0010 61.586000 73.111625 i actually was from the midwest but i uh i always liked the uh concept of going to a warmer [client/climate] climate uh so
sw4105B-ms98-a-0011 73.111625 77.684125 uh i generally leaned towards the sun belt uh 
sw4105B-ms98-a-0012 77.684125 82.400875 i've worked in uh San Diego and i've worked in Atlanta so you can see that i've moved 
sw4105B-ms98-a-0013 82.400875 89.438500 moved father south since then [laughter] uh i used to live in Ohio when i when i was going to school
sw4105B-ms98-a-0014 89.438500 100.466125 and uh it's still it it becomes a very strong benefit i uh i interviewed with uh companies in uh Baltimore and uh Boston
sw4105B-ms98-a-0015 100.466125 107.632125 and uh just the the amount of time that it shuts down that that winter shuts you down for activity
sw4105B-ms98-a-0016 107.632125 111.782500 always used to bother me because_1 i really never got into the winter sports
sw4105B-ms98-a-0017 111.782500 117.434250 but i like to be very much into the active intramural sports that was important to me
sw4105B-ms98-a-0018 117.434250 126.910875 uh other job benefited jo[b]- job benefits uh uh i like the idea of uh companies being flexible 
sw4105B-ms98-a-0019 126.910875 134.890125 uh uh with uh time schedules as much as possible i mean i you can't do too much and i understand that

sw4105B-ms98-a-0022 192.458000 202.477625 but what they [vocalized-noise] uh if they respect you as a professional you treat them like a professional at that i- i- i take it then that you are also a professional 
sw4105B-ms98-a-0023 202.477625 205.553125 [laughter] a salaried employee [laughter]
sw4105B-ms98-a-0024 205.553125 209.536625 [laughter] uh it
sw4105B-ms98-a-0025 209.536625 218.406500 usually they end up getting a lot more hours than i- i- i uh than the classic forty hours a week sometimes i hate to think about it if i would actually add up the hours and 
sw4105B-ms98-a-0026 218.406500 222.129250 i figure if i were getting time and a half what i was really making per hour
sw4105B-ms98-a-0027 222.129250 232.462875 oops [laughter] bu[t]- uh well let's see what other i i've always liked i've always liked some vacation i i've i've been fortunate i actually had a

sw4105B-ms98-a-0031 242.844625 247.205500 now that was a real nice benefit it gave me a lot of flexibility
sw4105B-ms98-a-0032 247.205500 254.914750 uh but of course now i've gone to zero amount of years in the company so now i'm back to the
sw4105B-ms98-a-0033 254.914750 260.661000 to the uh original two weeks [laughter] that was a tough benefit to give up
sw4105B-ms98-a-0034 260.661000 265.391875 [silence]
sw4105B-ms98-a-0035 265.391875 268.016000 yeah that is a good benefit
sw4105B-ms98-a-0036 268.016000 275.855125 [silence]
sw4105B-ms98-a-0037 275.855125 280.666500 right because of the amount of amount of work that you had to be done
sw4105B-ms98-a-0038 280.666500 298.946000 [silence]
