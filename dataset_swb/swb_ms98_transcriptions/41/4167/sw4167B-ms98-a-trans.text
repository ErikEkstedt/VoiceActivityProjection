sw4167B-ms98-a-0002 1.551250 14.968000 [silence]
sw4167B-ms98-a-0003 14.968000 16.552375 right yeah
sw4167B-ms98-a-0004 16.552375 23.664125 [silence]
sw4167B-ms98-a-0005 23.664125 24.562750 yeah
sw4167B-ms98-a-0006 24.562750 30.929125 i- i think i'd agree o[f]- o[f]- of a similar method of getting the news with me too it's uh
sw4167B-ms98-a-0007 30.929125 39.326250 uh CNN has been a welcome addition to [laughter] the T V scene here in the last uh number of years uh
sw4167B-ms98-a-0008 39.326250 45.798500 pr[ior]- prior to cable you know you didn't get much news off of normal uh television broadcasts
sw4167B-ms98-a-0009 45.798500 54.275375 uh just usually pretty local in in nature and and i like uh CNN because you get some world world events too
sw4167B-ms98-a-0010 54.275375 59.932500 uh which is not too common on on the other format newspapers and so forth
sw4167B-ms98-a-0011 59.932500 73.228500 [silence]
sw4167B-ms98-a-0012 73.228500 84.372750 that that's true you know you hardly ever see uh headline articles about the uh either the economics or or other wor[ld]- news events going on in either of those countries
sw4167B-ms98-a-0013 84.372750 97.321750 uh whereas if you pick up a a European paper you know uh it all the surrounding countries Soviet Union and everything has uh major news uh articles in them
sw4167B-ms98-a-0014 97.321750 112.997000 [silence]
sw4167B-ms98-a-0015 112.997000 114.546875 yeah
sw4167B-ms98-a-0016 114.546875 122.908625 w[ell]- i'm i'm currently living in Dallas and it it wo[n't]- it won't even give it the back [laughter-section] you just never see you just never see anything about it uh
sw4167B-ms98-a-0017 122.908625 131.827750 which is a shame because_1 you go to other countries uh and and they carry quite a bit about the US on the other hand and if you go up to uh
sw4167B-ms98-a-0018 131.827750 138.871375 Canada those people are usually pretty uh familiar with the politics going on and and the news events in the US and
sw4167B-ms98-a-0019 138.871375 146.155875 and we're pretty uh limited in our understanding of of leaders up in Canada or Mexico
sw4167B-ms98-a-0020 146.155875 149.079625 you just you just don't know what's going on
sw4167B-ms98-a-0021 149.079625 156.372375 i'd i every once in a while i have to travel overseas and then lately i've taken the taken a little shortwave radio uh
sw4167B-ms98-a-0022 156.372375 168.145875 around and picking up the BBC and it's sort of like uh a CNN too you you can tune into some stations and you get some like thirty minute summaries of of news events uh
sw4167B-ms98-a-0023 168.145875 175.342500 i occasionally get into some of the middle eastern uh area and that's the only way you can [laughter-tell] what's going on at all [laughter]
sw4167B-ms98-a-0024 175.342500 178.840000 there's not [laughter-much] in the way of television in some of those places
sw4167B-ms98-a-0025 178.840000 187.297875 um but that's a good point about about the neighboring countries i hadn't really thought about it but i guess you don't think about it because_1 you don't hear it [laughter]
sw4167B-ms98-a-0026 187.297875 205.627250 [silence]
sw4167B-ms98-a-0027 205.627250 206.761500 yeah
sw4167B-ms98-a-0028 206.761500 209.174000 [silence]
sw4167B-ms98-a-0029 209.174000 210.780875 yeah
sw4167B-ms98-a-0030 210.780875 217.804500 yeah you know there was a a what is it called is it Meech Lake Accord or or yeah that's just something uh
sw4167B-ms98-a-0031 217.804500 227.310875 i'd say ninety percent of the people here would never have heard of and i think that i heard of it about the first time when i was up in Calgary a couple of years ago and
sw4167B-ms98-a-0032 227.310875 238.272125 you know picked up a a paper and started reading a little bit more detail about it and and ca[me]- came and it was a big thing going on there and i came back here and nothing in the papers
sw4167B-ms98-a-0033 238.272125 240.203250 and just didn't see a thing about it
sw4167B-ms98-a-0034 240.203250 241.312125 [silence]
sw4167B-ms98-a-0035 241.312125 250.938875 so it's uh we've got a long ways to go i guess it's improved and like i say with CNN and and uh the cable news even even there's a uh
sw4167B-ms98-a-0036 250.938875 255.824125 it's sor[t]- it's semireligious in some respects but what is it it's uh
sw4167B-ms98-a-0037 255.824125 263.621000 i mean its news is not not that way uh oh i'm trying to think of the channel the Chr[istian]- the Christian Science Monitor
sw4167B-ms98-a-0038 263.621000 272.403125 uh i[t]- it surprised me i've caught it a few times and they they do some pretty good news uh seemingly unbiased news broadcasts uh
sw4167B-ms98-a-0039 272.403125 280.212625 uh the the title of the network is sort of surprising you'd think it would carry mostly religious but it it doesn't seem to so i'll flip through and
sw4167B-ms98-a-0040 280.212625 286.472000 [noise] listen to it once in awhile too uh and catch something maybe a little different than than CNN might be covering
sw4167B-ms98-a-0041 286.472000 294.735125 uh some more in[terest]- interest type topics in in other countries but it's kind of world world uh network too
sw4167B-ms98-a-0042 294.735125 299.138000 [silence]
