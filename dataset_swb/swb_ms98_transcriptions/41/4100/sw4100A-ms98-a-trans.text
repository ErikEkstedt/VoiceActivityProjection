sw4100A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.180000 [noise]
sw4100A-ms98-a-0002 0.180000 6.221625 uh actually it turns out to be an interesting topic because i'm now in the middle of a job search graduating here
sw4100A-ms98-a-0003 6.221625 13.963625 and realizing that one of the things that's not really well represented in benefits often is flexibility because my wife will
sw4100A-ms98-a-0004 13.963625 25.461750 have some set of benefits where ever she's working and the ability to mix and match in a useful way particularly with things like medical and dental it's something that i've been uh looking for
sw4100A-ms98-a-0005 25.461750 40.700000 [silence]
sw4100A-ms98-a-0006 40.700000 42.046750 [noise]
sw4100A-ms98-a-0007 42.046750 52.241875 [silence]
sw4100A-ms98-a-0008 52.241875 53.261250 [noise]
sw4100A-ms98-a-0009 53.261250 56.685625 [silence]
sw4100A-ms98-a-0010 56.685625 59.456625 that's amusing [laughter] yeah
sw4100A-ms98-a-0011 59.456625 62.310750 [silence]
sw4100A-ms98-a-0012 62.310750 74.805375 yeah i think we have a similar thing in California and i think that at the moment you can't issue health insurance that doesn't have coverage for substance abuse and certain other mental health issues and
sw4100A-ms98-a-0013 74.805375 79.670500 and the result is a lot of people won't provide it at all or over charge
sw4100A-ms98-a-0014 79.670500 83.581000 [noise]
sw4100A-ms98-a-0015 83.581000 84.998625 yeah
sw4100A-ms98-a-0016 84.998625 105.934875 [silence]
sw4100A-ms98-a-0017 105.934875 107.245375 yeah
sw4100A-ms98-a-0018 107.245375 113.864875 [silence]
sw4100A-ms98-a-0019 113.864875 125.685750 the other things they do seem to be willing to spend money in strange ways for instance i know where my wife works she can get for something like five or ten dollars a month sole health insurance but 
sw4100A-ms98-a-0020 125.685750 134.345375 it would cost her an additional sixty or seventy a month to include me on that policy well assuming that we both work at places that feel this way
sw4100A-ms98-a-0021 134.345375 139.075250 we may very well miss out on the convenience of going to the same place
sw4100A-ms98-a-0022 139.075250 148.831250 because those two places will never get together and agree okay one of them_1 will pay for all of the uh the dental and optical and the other one'll pay for the medical
sw4100A-ms98-a-0023 148.831250 153.197500 instead it's it's very much designed towards self only insurance
sw4100A-ms98-a-0024 153.197500 157.124250 i don't know if all employers are that way but a lot of them i have seen are
sw4100A-ms98-a-0025 157.124250 173.107375 [silence]
sw4100A-ms98-a-0026 173.107375 173.939500 [laughter]
sw4100A-ms98-a-0027 173.939500 174.942250 yeah
sw4100A-ms98-a-0028 174.942250 189.060125 [silence]
sw4100A-ms98-a-0029 189.060125 190.816375 well that's pretty good
sw4100A-ms98-a-0030 190.816375 192.744000 [silence]
sw4100A-ms98-a-0031 192.744000 194.004250 [laughter]
sw4100A-ms98-a-0032 194.004250 226.884500 [silence]
sw4100A-ms98-a-0033 226.884500 235.343625 that's something this university at at least the graduate student negotiated plan was very bad about this idea of low cost alternatives
sw4100A-ms98-a-0034 235.343625 243.735000 i know in one case there were doctors around who were affiliated with the university who you can go see and all your lab work is covered under their research
sw4100A-ms98-a-0035 243.735000 250.858250 so in fact you're saving them you know hundreds of dollars in in billings by going to a research uh
sw4100A-ms98-a-0036 250.858250 260.132000 physician yet at the same time they will only pay based on eighty percent of the customary reasonable charges for the physicians visits
sw4100A-ms98-a-0037 260.132000 269.574250 and won't take into account the fact that by seeing that doctor you're saving them you know a couple of hundred dollars over going to somebody else and a lot of things like that
sw4100A-ms98-a-0038 269.574250 270.581625 [silence]
sw4100A-ms98-a-0039 270.581625 282.225250 um one thing i was wondering is something i've noticed that that they don't publicize much but a lot of companies in particularly organizations school and government organizations have is legal uh services of some sort
sw4100A-ms98-a-0040 282.225250 283.169000 hm
sw4100A-ms98-a-0041 283.169000 291.010875 [silence]
sw4100A-ms98-a-0042 291.010875 292.259875 yeah
sw4100A-ms98-a-0043 292.259875 298.850000 [silence]
