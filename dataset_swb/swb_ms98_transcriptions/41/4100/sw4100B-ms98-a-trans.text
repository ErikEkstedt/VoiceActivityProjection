sw4100B-ms98-a-0002 25.136375 36.540250 that's true one of the really disturbing things for me is uh is the way that the government mandates that all insurance policies include particular benefits
sw4100B-ms98-a-0003 36.540250 46.369125 uh even though you could you might never have any need for them_1 uh here in Georgia they just passed a law for example that every health insurance policy
sw4100B-ms98-a-0004 46.369125 56.171125 must include coverage for mammograms and pap smears doesn't matter that you're single and male you still have coverage for mammograms and pap smears
sw4100B-ms98-a-0005 56.171125 63.043375 and uh [laughter] it's that kind of thing that uh uh that bothers me
sw4100B-ms98-a-0006 63.043375 72.110375 [silence]
sw4100B-ms98-a-0007 72.110375 77.981625 uh drug treat[ment]- yeah drug treatment and alcohol and yeah that's the same thing here even if you're
sw4100B-ms98-a-0008 77.981625 84.429625 even if you're a Mormon you still have to have uh coverage for smoking recovery you [laughter-know]
sw4100B-ms98-a-0009 84.429625 91.523250 uh but but in general your idea about flexibility i think is a very good one because uh
sw4100B-ms98-a-0010 91.523250 96.222500 uh if y[ou]- if you have a a full gamut of
sw4100B-ms98-a-0011 96.222500 108.887125 of coverages um uh uh there might there might be a lot of things that the company [vocalized-noise] is wi[lling]- willing to pay for but that you're simply not interested in and what you ra[ther]- prefer to do is say
sw4100B-ms98-a-0012 108.887125 114.734250 don't get some of those programs but shuffle the money over to another place to lower your deductibles or something

sw4100B-ms98-a-0018 156.661750 161.924000 yeah i think that uh a a lot of them_1 are that way they uh th[ey]-
sw4100B-ms98-a-0019 161.924000 171.095750 they dea[l]- they deal with coordination of benefits and and no no particular illness who's the primary [carrer/carrier] and who's the secondary carrier but um
sw4100B-ms98-a-0020 171.095750 179.584625 uh everyone tries to be the secondary carrier and it's very difficult to to get it worked out uh i know at at Hayes uh
sw4100B-ms98-a-0021 179.584625 189.680500 the coverage for the employee is is completely paid by the company and to get your entire family covered is thirty eight dollars a month

sw4100B-ms98-a-0023 201.954625 215.158375 there's a lot of particular things in the medical package that are covered from the first dollar particularly if you chose low cost alternatives like out patient treatment rather than inpatient and uh things like that
sw4100B-ms98-a-0024 215.158375 228.093375 um they have good educational benefits if you want to uh try to improve your uh you know g[o]- work further on a degree or or get a master's degree of something uh uh course
