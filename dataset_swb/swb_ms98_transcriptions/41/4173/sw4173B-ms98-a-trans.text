sw4173B-ms98-a-0003 5.795750 13.401375 well [noise] uh the the one we bought most recently and and i think that's a good guard because uh
sw4173B-ms98-a-0004 13.401375 24.485500 we uh we had r[equirements]- our requirements change we we now have two kids and so we need a little bit more room um the the one that we bought in in eighty eight
sw4173B-ms98-a-0005 24.485500 31.664500 uh was a response to the the first child being born and and for that we wanted something really dependable
sw4173B-ms98-a-0006 31.664500 38.863250 something with an excellent repair record uh something that we were not going have it in the shop a lot
sw4173B-ms98-a-0007 38.863250 49.990125 and of all the things that of all the ones that we looked at uh we looked in Consumer Reports and and asked around friends and and looked at our own experiences we went with a a Toyota
sw4173B-ms98-a-0008 49.990125 58.831250 uh we got a Toyota Corolla one of the the wagon kind so it's not as big as the the nineteen fifties uh suburban tank
sw4173B-ms98-a-0009 58.831250 69.412500 but it's it's spacious enough for for now w[e]- now we have two kids uh we've got to put two you know [vocalized-noise] you got enough room for two car seats and and that sort of thing um
sw4173B-ms98-a-0010 69.412500 75.034625 and the repair record has been really terrific um it's been very very nice
sw4173B-ms98-a-0011 75.034625 83.088375 so i think that um based on our own experience and how satisfied and and we know what sort of driving um
sw4173B-ms98-a-0012 83.088375 88.068000 requirements we have we we probably would go with that again it the repair record is
sw4173B-ms98-a-0013 88.068000 98.535625 is for us repair record and the g[as]- and the gas mileage is what drives it for us uh not whether it has a moon roof or uh how many CD players you can stack in it but
sw4173B-ms98-a-0014 98.535625 102.474500 but the the repair record is is the thing for us
