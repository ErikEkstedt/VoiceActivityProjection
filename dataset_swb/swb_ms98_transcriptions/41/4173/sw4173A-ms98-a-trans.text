sw4173A-ms98-a-0017 102.018750 110.058375 well i- i have a Nissan that's what i bought and i- i guess i originally bought it because of first of all because of the price
sw4173A-ms98-a-0018 110.058375 116.515250 because when i bought it i want you know i wanted something mo[re]- you know m[ost]- enough as much bang for the buck
sw4173A-ms98-a-0019 116.515250 124.199500 and i bought the car and i bought the car used and i had almost sixty there's almost sixty thousand miles on it
sw4173A-ms98-a-0020 124.199500 127.676875 and i have almost a hundred and ten thousand right now
sw4173A-ms98-a-0021 127.676875 141.103000 and since i've had the car i've bought a new battery i've i had a [noise] a fan belt pulley go out and the universals in the drive shaft
sw4173A-ms98-a-0022 141.103000 149.618750 but other than that i haven't had any problems with it i when i bought it i went down to Sears and had them_1 put four Sears Road Handlers on it
sw4173A-ms98-a-0023 149.618750 155.144000 and they've been on there for i guess almost forty seven thousand miles
sw4173A-ms98-a-0024 155.144000 157.948125 and they look visually they look
sw4173A-ms98-a-0025 157.948125 171.547750 brand new and it was i guess two months ago [noise] well i- i changed my the main thing is is the maintenance as you say and i do that i keep the oil changed with the high RPM motors little you know [noise] and
sw4173A-ms98-a-0026 171.547750 174.156250 i get took it to get it tuned up
sw4173A-ms98-a-0027 174.156250 185.367625 and when i first got it i took it i wanted the valves adjusted and i the guy went in and i had to pay for it the guy says you don't need them adjusted they're fine and so i waited another forty thousand miles and
sw4173A-ms98-a-0028 185.367625 196.493875 they just adjusted them but they really weren't [laughter-out] [laughter-of] adjustment he they looked at it and he goes it looks like a brand new motor it's because i keep the oil changed and i says well i- i wanted brakes changed and he said
sw4173A-ms98-a-0029 196.493875 197.537500 [silence]
sw4173A-ms98-a-0030 197.537500 199.187250 he looked at them_1
sw4173A-ms98-a-0031 199.187250 206.899500 and he says in the back you have three fourths of your pads and in the front they're three fourths you don't need them_1
sw4173A-ms98-a-0032 206.899500 215.487375 and i so i've been driving all these miles and i didn't need them_1 but i i changed the front i had the brakes done in the front anyway just because_1 i wanted the front wheels you know packed
sw4173A-ms98-a-0033 215.487375 222.644625 the the bearings packed and things and it worked out so i mean i i'm just amazed at the performance and i

sw4173A-ms98-a-0035 223.661500 236.160125 the Japanese cars it just seems that as far as the well i just going interject real quick as a my next purchase i want something with a little more safety features i want the air bags and the antilock brakes that's that's something that i want 
sw4173A-ms98-a-0036 236.160125 239.676125 but um i was going to inter[ject]- say is that
sw4173A-ms98-a-0037 239.676125 249.027250 [noise] when General Motors they sell their car and there's too much of a i- i believe there's just too much of a profit margin
