sw4123B-ms98-a-0015 56.688250 62.854750 uh overall i- i the quality of the news you get o[ff]- off of most uh
sw4123B-ms98-a-0016 62.854750 71.305000 sources i would say is pretty low it's usually you get pretty incomplete coverage and that's one of the reasons where i why i try and get
sw4123B-ms98-a-0017 71.305000 85.282125 as many sources as possible because if you hear the same story from three different sources then you get a much clearer picture of of what is going on you would hope it's still you know hard to say that what you've heard is what really is
sw4123B-ms98-a-0018 85.282125 88.001625 [silence]
sw4123B-ms98-a-0019 88.001625 97.992750 well i read uh the local newspaper and i also try and read one of the uh major dailies like the Chicago Tribune or the New York Times or something like that

sw4123B-ms98-a-0032 157.983875 165.651250 right yeah i miss NPR a lot also i really like them because they give uh instead of being as your newspaper or your
sw4123B-ms98-a-0033 165.651250 174.854500 TV news where you get a five minute blurb or a [vocalized-noise] ten paragraph blurb they go really in depth on topics which i think is good and they also 
sw4123B-ms98-a-0034 174.854500 182.246250 their editorial stand point seems to be a lot better than say your major network news and that kind of thing
sw4123B-ms98-a-0035 182.246250 185.569750 [silence]
sw4123B-ms98-a-0036 185.569750 186.895500 uh-huh

sw4123B-ms98-a-0053 253.498125 261.116125 if if you don't watch it there then you're going to hear somebody else's canned uh report somebody else's view about it and that's what you're supposed you're supposed to
sw4123B-ms98-a-0054 261.116125 274.797375 if you watch the news you're going your opinion is going to be formed about on what somebody else thought about it as opposed to actually watching it yourself and forming your own -[o]pinion opinion which i haven't would be much more in favor of forming my own opinion as opposed to following someone else's
