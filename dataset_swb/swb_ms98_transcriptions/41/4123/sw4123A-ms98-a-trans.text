sw4123A-ms98-a-0018 111.981250 121.815500 the want help wanted ads and so often they they tr[y]- the newspapers are trying to compete with a lot of other sources of newspap[er]- of news
sw4123A-ms98-a-0019 121.815500 134.431625 and i do[n't]- know New York Times is okay but um i do[n't]- know when you read a lot of this stuff the the quality of the writing is definitely gone down in the last ten years or so but
sw4123A-ms98-a-0020 134.431625 142.414625 uh i mean they they say it's like the sixth grade reading level but i swear it's at least second or third grade sometimes
sw4123A-ms98-a-0021 142.414625 149.228000 [noise] but i don't know um i think i[f]- if you listen to like NPR or something like

sw4123A-ms98-a-0023 159.186000 172.497875 [silence]
