sw4128B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.490875 [noise]
sw4128B-ms98-a-0002 0.490875 10.954500 okay uh let's see when it comes to to uh sentencing i i'm a little confused because the the only things that i read about sentencing
sw4128B-ms98-a-0003 10.954500 18.782125 and juries well the only things i know are the things that i read and the things that i read are are either how should i say it they're
sw4128B-ms98-a-0004 18.782125 30.190625 they're written by people that that have an axe to grind so if somebody thinks that the judge is judges are too lenient why i read all kinds of let's throw them all in jail and then if i i've
sw4128B-ms98-a-0005 30.190625 36.474500 you know i've i've read other things that i i wish i could see a uh an informed
sw4128B-ms98-a-0006 36.474500 40.497125 uh discussion as opposed to just
sw4128B-ms98-a-0007 40.497125 44.215000 what i see these days as one side you know some one side's mad
sw4128B-ms98-a-0008 44.215000 45.303250 [silence]
sw4128B-ms98-a-0009 45.303250 46.954125 and uh
sw4128B-ms98-a-0010 46.954125 48.987125 so i uh
sw4128B-ms98-a-0011 48.987125 55.996000 i i guess what i'm trying to say is uh i have mixed feelings because sometimes i think that the judges um
sw4128B-ms98-a-0012 55.996000 70.003000 are overstepping their bounds and they shouldn't be the the juries should be the only ones that uh have a say in it and other times i think well no the juries are out of hand the judges need to step in
sw4128B-ms98-a-0013 70.003000 98.497250 [noise]
sw4128B-ms98-a-0014 98.497250 109.971125 on the case i've remember reading a a discussion about a jury that that uh heard a case and they and they awarded
sw4128B-ms98-a-0015 109.971125 111.495500 uh
sw4128B-ms98-a-0016 111.495500 122.495625 uh how should i say it they agreed that the one person was guilty and they and they agreed that the fine should be so much and then the judge came along and set aside the judgement which
sw4128B-ms98-a-0017 122.495625 126.999375 [vocalized-noise] the way the article was written was a terrible injustice
sw4128B-ms98-a-0018 126.999375 131.025000 uh but like i say i uh
sw4128B-ms98-a-0019 131.025000 143.843000 there's i rarely see uh both sides of that i just hear about it from one side i don't hear the other side the the one thing that i am kind of upset about is the fact that juries are selected
sw4128B-ms98-a-0020 143.843000 153.729000 uh to be the lowest uh how should i say this they have any opinions at all they're weeded out been one or the other of the uh of the lawyers
sw4128B-ms98-a-0021 153.729000 155.484125 and so
sw4128B-ms98-a-0022 155.484125 156.518750 [silence]
sw4128B-ms98-a-0023 156.518750 159.483500 to be honest with you i've i've uh
sw4128B-ms98-a-0024 159.483500 160.489875 [silence]
sw4128B-ms98-a-0025 160.489875 165.655000 i don't think that's right and if i ever am called to be a a juror
sw4128B-ms98-a-0026 165.655000 169.314500 and they ask me if i have strong opinions i'm i'm just
sw4128B-ms98-a-0027 169.314500 170.994250 i'm not
sw4128B-ms98-a-0028 170.994250 172.495875 [laughter]
sw4128B-ms98-a-0029 172.495875 184.220250 well i- i i if i answer honestly if i answer honestly i'll be weeded out if i if i just like looked at him and say uh no i don't have strong opinions because i feel like you know i want to be part of the process
sw4128B-ms98-a-0030 184.220250 188.749500 and uh like i say it bothers me that that th[e]-
sw4128B-ms98-a-0031 188.749500 191.197875 that the
sw4128B-ms98-a-0032 191.197875 192.745125 lawyers
sw4128B-ms98-a-0033 192.745125 194.498375 can
sw4128B-ms98-a-0034 194.498375 199.280875 weed anybody with a college education or anybody uh
sw4128B-ms98-a-0035 199.280875 210.262500 [noise] oh let's say with a with any college educa[tions]- you know much schooling or certain [vocalized-noise] uh uh backgrounds like for instance if you're a
sw4128B-ms98-a-0036 210.262500 222.249500 if you've go to church once a a a month or something like that why they don't want you on the jury or you know things like that it it bothers me that that that we're judging people on the basis of 
sw4128B-ms98-a-0037 222.249500 225.982375 of uh what do you call it uh
sw4128B-ms98-a-0038 225.982375 228.497875 [silence]
sw4128B-ms98-a-0039 228.497875 242.987000 no well what i'm trying to say is the jury jurors are selected to basically be from what i've been told milk toasts if they have any opinions if they could understand anything an engineer could never be uh a juror for instance because he's
sw4128B-ms98-a-0040 242.987000 244.487000 he's uh
sw4128B-ms98-a-0041 244.487000 253.991000 he's not easily uh persuaded or or or how shall i say this th[is]- it's easy to hoodwink or it's it's hard to hoodwink him that kind of thing
sw4128B-ms98-a-0042 253.991000 256.012000 so that's what i'm kind of worried about
sw4128B-ms98-a-0043 256.012000 272.971625 [silence]
sw4128B-ms98-a-0044 272.971625 281.034875 right uh that's what you want but on the other hand if the lawyer thinks no i don't want a bunch of people in here who are going to be able to weed their way through
sw4128B-ms98-a-0045 281.034875 291.983000 uh you know to weed the good from the bad they will absolutely go for people who uh how should i say it the s[crub]- the scrub women and the the janitors i'm i'm
sw4128B-ms98-a-0046 291.983000 298.402000 trying not to be prejudiced against them but you know any any education will disqualify you in in many cases i've been
