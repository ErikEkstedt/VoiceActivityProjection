sw4159B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.575250 [noise]
sw4159B-ms98-a-0002 0.575250 4.380125 [silence]
sw4159B-ms98-a-0003 4.380125 13.321875 well i work for an insurance company so i see a lot of uh verdicts that are pretty crazily decided um
sw4159B-ms98-a-0004 13.321875 20.855625 by juries particularly and i know in England the judges set all of the awards you know juries will decide the guilt or innocence
sw4159B-ms98-a-0005 20.855625 22.919500 but then they leave the
sw4159B-ms98-a-0006 22.919500 32.198500 awards up to more learned people and i think maybe that avoids some of these totally ridiculous you know like millions and millions of dollars [laughter]
sw4159B-ms98-a-0007 32.198500 41.391375 [silence]
sw4159B-ms98-a-0008 41.391375 47.291625 oh exactly [noise] each individual jury really doesn't have any perception of what um
sw4159B-ms98-a-0009 47.291625 48.433625 [silence]
sw4159B-ms98-a-0010 48.433625 56.305500 the going you know if you will the going uh award should be for a certain type of case you know within some kind of range
sw4159B-ms98-a-0011 56.305500 58.912125 when you get one way out like that
sw4159B-ms98-a-0012 58.912125 70.040125 that then really doesn't penali[ze]- wind up penalizing the person that they went after who it really penalizes is their insurance company which then translates into higher rates for all of us 
sw4159B-ms98-a-0013 70.040125 76.600500 if they get some of those mega awards against them you know they're not going to sit there and lose money if they're losing money then they're going to raise rates
sw4159B-ms98-a-0014 76.600500 82.244750 so it all comes filtering down to us all i[ndividually]- i[ndividually]- individually
sw4159B-ms98-a-0015 82.244750 87.137375 and uh granted some people need to be compensated if they have really been wronged
sw4159B-ms98-a-0016 87.137375 88.417375 you know
sw4159B-ms98-a-0017 88.417375 102.659750 [silence]
sw4159B-ms98-a-0018 102.659750 107.685625 i don't know you know some of the health insurance is written that way you know that uh
sw4159B-ms98-a-0019 107.685625 121.005125 if you buy an accident and death or dismemberment policy you know it s[pecifies]- pre specifies in the policy uh so much but i don't know that you can necessarily put a [noise] a value on somebody's limb
sw4159B-ms98-a-0020 121.005125 126.895625 uh arbitrarily that is always going to fit in all cases i think maybe
sw4159B-ms98-a-0021 126.895625 137.096000 you look at uh the age of the person and their station in life and and uh how much longer they have of work years that they would have to put up you know with
sw4159B-ms98-a-0022 137.096000 142.717625 with that i mean maybe you don't award an eighty five year old guy the same thing that you'd award a twenty one year old
sw4159B-ms98-a-0023 142.717625 149.751125 i- i think it has to be some kind of common sense applied there and that may be where the judiciary is a little more
sw4159B-ms98-a-0024 149.751125 163.435500 learned about that s[tuff]- type of thing because they can be schooled in that kind of thing and it could be part of continuing education maybe for judges [laughter] i don't know you know to get into the economics of things uh
sw4159B-ms98-a-0025 163.435500 175.697500 because_1 if they wheel somebody into a courtroom and the jury's heart goes out to that person and they do one of these mega awards it really you know ultimately is not penalizing the person that they're trying to get anyway
sw4159B-ms98-a-0026 175.697500 184.444875 if it's a company you know that they're insured unless the award is so staggering that it goes all beyond their layers of insurance
sw4159B-ms98-a-0027 184.444875 190.632375 which is another pet peeve of mine when they do award punitive damages i think those should be uninsurable
sw4159B-ms98-a-0028 190.632375 196.948625 i think those should have to be paid by the corporation itself that that did the damage
sw4159B-ms98-a-0029 196.948625 198.967000 [silence]
sw4159B-ms98-a-0030 198.967000 200.376750 yeah
sw4159B-ms98-a-0031 200.376750 201.505500 yeah
sw4159B-ms98-a-0032 201.505500 211.119750 for for honest mistakes where they've done something and and something happens one of their employees causes damage or something sure that's what they buy insurance for but
sw4159B-ms98-a-0033 211.119750 214.216375 [silence]
sw4159B-ms98-a-0034 214.216375 216.769125 well i was just talking about any company
sw4159B-ms98-a-0035 216.769125 231.424625 uh let's just say a lumber manufacturing company and uh somebody is on the premises and one of the employees actually is driving by with a forklift and he pushes the wrong button and he drops a load of lumber on somebody and it injures them_1 sure insurance should pay for that
sw4159B-ms98-a-0036 231.424625 236.478500 [silence]
sw4159B-ms98-a-0037 236.478500 250.623250 well i'm not talking about any loss i was talking about only losses that are judged for a punitive damage which is another category of the juries are awarding damages these days based on the person's actual injuries and what they're due
sw4159B-ms98-a-0038 250.623250 264.705875 and then they're awarding a second amount as punishment to the company which is a l[ot]- usually a lot less but it's uh an amount their designed to sting them_1 a little for their negligence for gross wanton negligence in a claim
sw4159B-ms98-a-0039 264.705875 271.765250 and unfortunately the j[ury]- the lately the courts have been deciding that those could be paid for by insurance too
sw4159B-ms98-a-0040 271.765250 278.898000 so again it never really penalizes the company doing the wrong they can go right on doing the same old thing they always used to
sw4159B-ms98-a-0041 278.898000 286.305875 and if they if they know some practice is wrong you know i'm not talking about your isolated occurrences i'm talking more about the
sw4159B-ms98-a-0042 286.305875 296.824250 you know the thing that they know maybe they're willfully manufacturing something that they know is hurting people out there and they continue to do it even after they become aware of that
sw4159B-ms98-a-0043 296.824250 299.842000 then i think they ought to have to pay something out of their own pocket
