sw4113B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.443125 [noise]
sw4113B-ms98-a-0002 0.443125 4.415625 [silence]
sw4113B-ms98-a-0003 4.415625 18.792875 generally i don't think they are uh my my personal opinion is that uh the politicians are out for their own good because they they're entrenched they don't ever have to go out and get a real job they just stay in their current job you know what i mean
sw4113B-ms98-a-0004 18.792875 26.774125 [silence]
sw4113B-ms98-a-0005 26.774125 37.902750 i think by putting term limitations on you could you could slow down some of the problems uh but it has to be not just at the national level but at the you know the state and the local level too
sw4113B-ms98-a-0006 37.902750 44.498125 i know some senators and i don't know which ones but they've been in office since the the nineteen forties and
sw4113B-ms98-a-0007 44.498125 55.534125 i they they've never had a job i mean they've never gone out in the real world and and paid normal taxes i know they pay taxes but they don't you know they they get paid a hundred and twenty five grand a year
sw4113B-ms98-a-0008 55.534125 65.101125 which is more than twice my salary by quite a bit and you know i'm going like i i don't understand how they're supposed to be my servants and yet they're paid more than i am and they work less
sw4113B-ms98-a-0009 65.101125 67.047250 you know less than i do [laughter]
sw4113B-ms98-a-0010 67.047250 98.004000 [silence]
sw4113B-ms98-a-0011 98.004000 104.664750 i think i think that's true however i think that's always been true
sw4113B-ms98-a-0012 104.664750 110.882125 i mean that's true of the presidency too and we seem to be able to get along with the President turnover every eight years or four years 
sw4113B-ms98-a-0013 110.882125 119.807375 and uh they i mean there is a lot to learn but maybe it will keep them on their toes and a little bit more active in trying to catch up i think two years is too short
sw4113B-ms98-a-0014 119.807375 132.233625 i think it has to be extended uh you know a term limitation for Congress would be like three terms or even four terms or you would increase the length of the of each term of a Congressman
sw4113B-ms98-a-0015 132.233625 146.961375 uh but maybe standardizing on on a a four year term for Congress Senate and the the presidency and then uh staggering them so that you don't you we aren't having a massive ballot every four years 
sw4113B-ms98-a-0016 146.961375 185.694625 [silence]
sw4113B-ms98-a-0017 185.694625 200.213625 uh-huh i think i think that that's true but then you have you have the same abuse of power on the flip side of that coin uh the C i A is moving out to West Virginia which is a really stupid location for
sw4113B-ms98-a-0018 200.213625 210.320625 a large agency like that and for almost any agency i mean the action isn't in West Virginia i hate to tell the s[enator]- the senator from West Virginia this information but
sw4113B-ms98-a-0019 210.320625 224.040625 it really doesn't [vocalized-noise] uh the world does not revolve around West Virginia uh as far as this country is concerned the world does revolve around D C you know as far as the politics in this country are concerned the national politics and 
sw4113B-ms98-a-0020 224.040625 237.768625 the C I A is a a very large very high profile agency and to have it located out in West Virginia yeah you know it might only be two hour drive from here but that's a two hour drive
sw4113B-ms98-a-0021 237.768625 247.540875 and uh you know it it's a i think it's a mistake to move large agencies like that or is it the F B I i don't remember but i think there's
sw4113B-ms98-a-0022 247.540875 255.203125 [silence]
sw4113B-ms98-a-0023 255.203125 257.158875 yeah that's officially
sw4113B-ms98-a-0024 257.158875 268.599250 i mean we all know that that's not necessarily true but i i think that there are there are advantages to having seniority and uh
sw4113B-ms98-a-0025 268.599250 279.640000 turn[over]- or not having a complete turnover every some small number of years i think there are i mean there's an institutional memory that you need to maintain
sw4113B-ms98-a-0026 279.640000 288.109125 but i think that uh all with all the perks that we've given them i mean i heard on the radio back a a few weeks ago
sw4113B-ms98-a-0027 288.109125 299.618000 uh during the incidents where they were you know like they aren't paying their their restaurant bills and they're bouncing checks all over the place uh one of the radio stations over here listed off every single one of the perks
