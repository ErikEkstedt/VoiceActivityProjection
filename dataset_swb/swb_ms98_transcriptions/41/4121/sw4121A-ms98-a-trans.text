sw4121A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.540000 [noise]
sw4121A-ms98-a-0002 0.540000 4.839250 well what kind of uh programs do y'all have up there for recycling
sw4121A-ms98-a-0003 4.839250 13.444500 [silence]
sw4121A-ms98-a-0004 13.444500 14.663000 um-hum
sw4121A-ms98-a-0005 14.663000 20.044125 [silence]
sw4121A-ms98-a-0006 20.044125 25.492000 is there a curbside service or do you have to take it to a distribution or a collection center
sw4121A-ms98-a-0007 25.492000 32.593625 [silence]
sw4121A-ms98-a-0008 32.593625 34.416000 oh okay
sw4121A-ms98-a-0009 34.416000 38.933625 [silence]
sw4121A-ms98-a-0010 38.933625 50.143500 right well we have it once a week they just started it not too long ago and we have newspaper and glass and then like a very select group of [laughter] plastics
sw4121A-ms98-a-0011 50.143500 56.650875 um but it's not real convenient like you said for lots of other things um and
sw4121A-ms98-a-0012 56.650875 63.878250 it it is kind of nice though because you can put everything in together and you don't have to sort it out which is nice
sw4121A-ms98-a-0013 63.878250 65.090875 [silence]
sw4121A-ms98-a-0014 65.090875 66.844250 no
sw4121A-ms98-a-0015 66.844250 80.505750 uh you just they gave us a little bin and you put everything in it there's a little separate top basket thing for the newspaper which is convenient but if you want to recycle anything other than their list you know good luck [laughter]
sw4121A-ms98-a-0016 80.505750 94.155125 um we have a couple of collection places around but they're pretty inconvenient to get to and and those you do have to sort and and most people don't have room you know in their house for ten or twenty different bins
sw4121A-ms98-a-0017 94.155125 96.974000 for all the different sorting things you have to do
sw4121A-ms98-a-0018 96.974000 113.020750 [silence]
sw4121A-ms98-a-0019 113.020750 114.306000 right
sw4121A-ms98-a-0020 114.306000 118.000625 [silence]
sw4121A-ms98-a-0021 118.000625 123.114250 well what's kind of interesting is here when the program started they
sw4121A-ms98-a-0022 123.114250 136.356375 made a big deal about it but they only gave it to like five thousand houses which in Atlanta is nothing you know and it was interesting because_1 it was the only reason we got it is because_1 we're sort of on the outskirts of this
sw4121A-ms98-a-0023 136.356375 148.588125 rather plush area so [laughter] you can tell where they put the recycling uh program in place so Atlanta really hasn't spread it out very much at all yet i don't think um i guess
sw4121A-ms98-a-0024 148.588125 150.880250 budgetary restraints
sw4121A-ms98-a-0025 150.880250 153.043625 [silence]
sw4121A-ms98-a-0026 153.043625 155.849500 um no i live off campus
sw4121A-ms98-a-0027 155.849500 157.868625 yeah pretty far off
sw4121A-ms98-a-0028 157.868625 158.930375 [silence]
sw4121A-ms98-a-0029 158.930375 168.824125 right no it's it's the city the s[chool]- Georgia Tech has it's own well has been trying to get it's own recycling program uh uh operated through the student government
sw4121A-ms98-a-0030 168.824125 182.695375 but there they've tried and tried to get an area allotted to them for a collection center and the school keeps saying no because uh there's a lot of people in in town homeless people who collect cans
sw4121A-ms98-a-0031 182.695375 190.919500 for a living and they're afraid that that's going to attract crime onto campus having a ready supply of cans
sw4121A-ms98-a-0032 190.919500 193.115625 [silence]
sw4121A-ms98-a-0033 193.115625 199.858625 [laughter] no well i don't know wh[at]- wh[at]- you know what their their philosophy was on that
sw4121A-ms98-a-0034 199.858625 209.161625 but uh th[at]- so they it's kind of a crime that we have all these students wanting to do this and n[o]- no cooperation to to get that program going
sw4121A-ms98-a-0035 209.161625 210.498750 but
sw4121A-ms98-a-0036 210.498750 220.678750 a a friend of mine and i had also thought a while back about doing some recycling on our own to make some money and i think it was interesting i found out that glass
sw4121A-ms98-a-0037 220.678750 224.156500 is only worth like a penny a pound
sw4121A-ms98-a-0038 224.156500 234.675500 and when you start figuring how much glass you need to make you know if you figure you can fill a big trash can with glass and get a hundred pounds well that's great but that's a dollar [laughter]
sw4121A-ms98-a-0039 234.675500 239.405500 so it's not a real profitable thing for for people to do
sw4121A-ms98-a-0040 239.405500 245.547375 [silence]
sw4121A-ms98-a-0041 245.547375 246.832500 uh-huh
sw4121A-ms98-a-0042 246.832500 253.219125 [silence]
sw4121A-ms98-a-0043 253.219125 254.482875 right
sw4121A-ms98-a-0044 254.482875 257.629125 [silence]
sw4121A-ms98-a-0045 257.629125 258.944375 wow
sw4121A-ms98-a-0046 258.944375 261.958500 [silence]
sw4121A-ms98-a-0047 261.958500 268.385000 yeah well now i know that i know that the same thing applies for aluminum it's much more profitable than glass
sw4121A-ms98-a-0048 268.385000 279.455000 um but i just thought you know we had thought wow this would be a nice little sideline because there's ev[ery]- we'd been going out to the bars around here and we'd asked at three different places and nobody recycles
sw4121A-ms98-a-0049 279.455000 283.404250 so we thought well you got this ready market you know the 
sw4121A-ms98-a-0050 283.404250 290.030125 these bars with all this glass and beer bottles and yet there's there's almost no way you could make money at it
sw4121A-ms98-a-0051 290.030125 298.562000 because the labor and the cost of gas would eat up any profit you'd make because glass is you know but i'm sure that as far as aluminum
