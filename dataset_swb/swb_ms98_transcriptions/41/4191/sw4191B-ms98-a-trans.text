sw4191B-ms98-a-0003 3.153875 15.622875 well it's hard to say there is certainly uh some discussion about that with the uh people trying to come in from Haiti and uh the government wanting to send them back if there is no clear evidence
sw4191B-ms98-a-0004 15.622875 18.023500 of uh political
sw4191B-ms98-a-0005 18.023500 20.290875 uh repression
sw4191B-ms98-a-0006 20.290875 21.851500 uh
sw4191B-ms98-a-0007 21.851500 28.707250 the country has set itself for so long as the uh the haven for people
sw4191B-ms98-a-0008 28.707250 37.092000 from other places uh giving them an opportunity for a new start but [vocalized-noise] uh was back in the days when there was a lot of 
sw4191B-ms98-a-0009 37.092000 44.447500 a lot of land and a lot of opportunities that uh just don't seem to be available now

sw4191B-ms98-a-0011 52.136750 53.650125 that's true

sw4191B-ms98-a-0013 64.360375 70.721875 [laughter] that uh that's true the uh
sw4191B-ms98-a-0014 70.721875 81.779000 i- i think the fact though that there is not a standard uh or or an equitable policy in place is causing a lot of trouble
sw4191B-ms98-a-0015 81.779000 88.465375 uh there was a e[ssentially]- essentially an immigration lottery a few months back
sw4191B-ms98-a-0016 88.465375 91.745250 [silence]
sw4191B-ms98-a-0017 91.745250 92.662125 it

sw4191B-ms98-a-0021 101.610875 103.021250 right
sw4191B-ms98-a-0022 103.021250 114.341000 and one of the things that uh that everyone was up and arms about was that uh there was a certain preference given to uh to people coming over from Ireland
sw4191B-ms98-a-0023 114.341000 116.233875 and how
sw4191B-ms98-a-0024 116.233875 121.866375 how a decision like that is made uh oh we don't have enough Irish in this country
sw4191B-ms98-a-0025 121.866375 135.462500 just just seems to be be fairly strange uh uh either you know oh if we feel that we've been wrong in in keeping the Irish out or whatever it is i- i don't understand
sw4191B-ms98-a-0026 135.462500 140.292250 how this is all working and i'm not sure the people who are running it understand it either

sw4191B-ms98-a-0030 148.039625 153.447375 that's that's the hard question that that always seems to be the hard question
sw4191B-ms98-a-0031 153.447375 157.230250 i don't know that there's
sw4191B-ms98-a-0032 157.230250 162.132625 there's a lot we can do short of either
sw4191B-ms98-a-0033 162.132625 172.862125 uh not allowing any immigration whatsoever or opening the flood gates i think that any middle ground is going to uh have its
sw4191B-ms98-a-0034 172.862125 179.414750 i[t]- i[t]- it's going to have uh people complaining about discrimination and uh
sw4191B-ms98-a-0035 179.414750 182.453250 and other problems like that
sw4191B-ms98-a-0036 182.453250 183.473125 uh
sw4191B-ms98-a-0037 183.473125 184.918875 [silence]
sw4191B-ms98-a-0038 184.918875 190.423125 it's interesting to me to see the uh the current administration
sw4191B-ms98-a-0039 190.423125 204.970000 welcome people from one country and then people who are who are battling to get here from Haiti uh are are rounded up thrown on a military base and shipped back at the earliest possible moment
sw4191B-ms98-a-0040 204.970000 206.357625 uh
sw4191B-ms98-a-0041 206.357625 213.108125 given the fact that uh a democracy was overthrown in Haiti it it's uh
sw4191B-ms98-a-0042 213.108125 224.274625 contradictory to the the policy of supporting democracy throughout the world that now we want to turn around and send them back because they don't like the uh
sw4191B-ms98-a-0043 224.274625 228.389750 the government the current government that overthrew the democracy

sw4191B-ms98-a-0054 249.351125 258.125500 and i- i think that maybe that selectivity is is a bigger problem than just the problem of immigration
sw4191B-ms98-a-0055 258.125500 271.615750 is that when it is selective like that is fairly visible and people realize that uh oh yes we'll let these people in because uh w[e]- we don't like their government
sw4191B-ms98-a-0056 271.615750 272.972750 uh
sw4191B-ms98-a-0057 272.972750 276.234375 i[t]- i[t]- it's an odd situation
sw4191B-ms98-a-0058 276.234375 287.374125 of course we haven't touched on at all what happens when these people with no visible means of support come to this country without any contacts or any uh
