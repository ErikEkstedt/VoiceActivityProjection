sw4154A-ms98-a-0050 146.945875 154.965250 well to begin with you know i pretty much question our what what what the US's motives were in uh in in in actually the original involvement 
sw4154A-ms98-a-0051 154.965250 156.952500 um [noise] i've 
sw4154A-ms98-a-0052 156.952500 160.981500 the cynical side of me says that you know who it was more for
sw4154A-ms98-a-0053 160.981500 162.793625 uh um
sw4154A-ms98-a-0054 162.793625 166.966625 the the domestic political situation than for anything else
sw4154A-ms98-a-0055 166.966625 171.127125 you know and that you know and for portraying Bush as a strong president
sw4154A-ms98-a-0056 171.127125 174.327125 um i mean i really i really think that that
sw4154A-ms98-a-0057 174.327125 175.622250 [silence]
sw4154A-ms98-a-0058 175.622250 181.011625 my gut feeling is that that that you know he pretty much picked picked a fight with um
sw4154A-ms98-a-0059 181.011625 187.190000 with um Hussein i mean i'm not not saying at all that Hussein wasn't quite willing to ge[t]- enter that fight
sw4154A-ms98-a-0060 187.190000 189.075000 but i- i think i think that
sw4154A-ms98-a-0061 189.075000 190.565250 [silence]
sw4154A-ms98-a-0062 190.565250 192.202000 that um

sw4154A-ms98-a-0073 217.623375 224.007625 i think i think it was it was there were there were a lot more demographic related interests involved than
sw4154A-ms98-a-0074 224.007625 226.887125 true foreign policy interests
sw4154A-ms98-a-0075 226.887125 228.480125 um
