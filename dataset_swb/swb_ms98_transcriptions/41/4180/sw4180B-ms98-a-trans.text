sw4180B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.102750 [noise]
sw4180B-ms98-a-0002 1.102750 5.563750 [silence]
sw4180B-ms98-a-0003 5.563750 11.364125 well it it it's the type of thing of what exactly am i getting out of the taxes and
sw4180B-ms98-a-0004 11.364125 14.326500 to some extent there is definitely
sw4180B-ms98-a-0005 14.326500 27.248125 you know you can say all right i'm paying this money for this and this is what i'm getting back in terms of roads and highways and you know i guess quote unquote retirement if it's actually there when we actually end up retiring
sw4180B-ms98-a-0006 27.248125 33.535250 there there seems to be some prob[lem]- you know some question on whether there will be actually money there or not
sw4180B-ms98-a-0007 33.535250 39.372125 what i don't like about the taxes is i was looking through the IRS forms like uh the other day 
sw4180B-ms98-a-0008 39.372125 48.743250 i noticed that fourteen percent of the amount of money that we pay in for taxes each year is just going to pay the national debt
sw4180B-ms98-a-0009 48.743250 51.382250 [silence]
sw4180B-ms98-a-0010 51.382250 54.155750 that that is the interest on the debt
sw4180B-ms98-a-0011 54.155750 60.812250 [silence]
sw4180B-ms98-a-0012 60.812250 62.067250 ourselves
sw4180B-ms98-a-0013 62.067250 63.270375 [silence]
sw4180B-ms98-a-0014 63.270375 76.571500 um to a large extent i mean one of the i think i'm not sure if it's the largest but i know a large segment of the national debt is um you know things like savings bonds and other government obligations
sw4180B-ms98-a-0015 76.571500 82.572000 [silence]
sw4180B-ms98-a-0016 82.572000 92.060125 well not not just private but there's you know lot of public institutions that are holding money as well as a lot of um foreign companies and foreign persons
sw4180B-ms98-a-0017 92.060125 94.940250 that are holding that but
sw4180B-ms98-a-0018 94.940250 97.677750 yeah nongovernmental
sw4180B-ms98-a-0019 97.677750 102.436000 yeah you know Treasury Certificates and US Savings Bonds and whatever
sw4180B-ms98-a-0020 102.436000 117.407625 [silence]
sw4180B-ms98-a-0021 117.407625 130.914000 right well it's actually uh you also looking at the same form they had that we are borr[owing]- the US is borrowing eighteen percent of the amount of of h[ow]- how of whatever it's spending every year 
sw4180B-ms98-a-0022 130.914000 134.990375 [silence]
sw4180B-ms98-a-0023 134.990375 146.802625 yeah so we're borrowing eighteen percent and fourteen percent of what we're paying out is going to pay the eight[een]- the uh debt so to some extent we're borrowing money to pay
sw4180B-ms98-a-0024 146.802625 152.854625 you know fourteen percent that we're borrowing goes directly paying out to the debt
sw4180B-ms98-a-0025 152.854625 166.567500 yeah so we're you know net we're doing a net borrowing of four percent each year and then we're doing a borrowing on top of that of fourteen percent that just goes to pay interest on the debt
sw4180B-ms98-a-0026 166.567500 172.768000 [silence]
sw4180B-ms98-a-0027 172.768000 184.463250 that i don't know i don't know if uh other countries work as a deficit or not i from what i can understand it's only recent within maybe the last fifty years or so
sw4180B-ms98-a-0028 184.463250 189.650000 you know except for wartimes that the U S has had a peacetime debt
sw4180B-ms98-a-0029 189.650000 194.934375 [silence]
sw4180B-ms98-a-0030 194.934375 196.103250 yeah
sw4180B-ms98-a-0031 196.103250 198.903375 [silence]
sw4180B-ms98-a-0032 198.903375 209.782625 yeah i- i think if you look at some of the uh government spending curves um you know the the curve always went up around wartime and then dropped back down
sw4180B-ms98-a-0033 209.782625 217.641250 after World War Two it never dropped back down or it was [vocalized-noise] World War Two or uh Korea i think it never dropped back down 
sw4180B-ms98-a-0034 217.641250 225.993125 [silence]
sw4180B-ms98-a-0035 225.993125 231.821125 well you know definitely one thing is to say hey we have to have a year to year balanced budget 
sw4180B-ms98-a-0036 231.821125 237.252250 [silence]
sw4180B-ms98-a-0037 237.252250 246.424125 yeah so you know you know maybe raise taxes for a few years until that debt gets paid off and then say you know unless there is a
sw4180B-ms98-a-0038 246.424125 254.014250 tremendously bad circumstances like a war or something we should not be running a deficit economy
sw4180B-ms98-a-0039 254.014250 265.761375 you know that's i mean if you look on the individual level if i were to borrow eighteen percent of what i was spending every year year after year i very quickly get in trouble with creditors 
sw4180B-ms98-a-0040 265.761375 272.282125 [silence]
sw4180B-ms98-a-0041 272.282125 282.261000 um yeah well that's you know the post wartime Germany they just kept printing up money and you know it became worthless so that's one danger
sw4180B-ms98-a-0042 282.261000 286.269875 but you know it's that that's a very large chunk of
sw4180B-ms98-a-0043 286.269875 289.162750 the money we pay in for taxes each year
sw4180B-ms98-a-0044 289.162750 298.082000 [silence]
