sw4180A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 5.433250 [noise] so uh how do you feel about the taxes you pay do you feel you pay uh too much or
sw4180A-ms98-a-0002 5.433250 7.458750 about right or
sw4180A-ms98-a-0003 7.458750 9.715500 [silence]
sw4180A-ms98-a-0004 9.715500 11.127250 yeah
sw4180A-ms98-a-0005 11.127250 25.230500 [silence]
sw4180A-ms98-a-0006 25.230500 27.718375 [laughter] [laughter-yeah] it's hard to tell 
sw4180A-ms98-a-0007 27.718375 31.985125 [silence]
sw4180A-ms98-a-0008 31.985125 33.321500 uh-huh
sw4180A-ms98-a-0009 33.321500 38.579875 [silence]
sw4180A-ms98-a-0010 38.579875 39.915625 uh-huh
sw4180A-ms98-a-0011 39.915625 45.857875 [silence]
sw4180A-ms98-a-0012 45.857875 47.234375 um-hum
sw4180A-ms98-a-0013 47.234375 49.054125 [silence]
sw4180A-ms98-a-0014 49.054125 53.117125 now is that the debt [vocalized-noise] or is that just the interest on the debt 
sw4180A-ms98-a-0015 53.117125 61.690500 yes [vocalized-noise] you know i really don't understand this completely i've always been a little mystified who who are we paying it to 
sw4180A-ms98-a-0016 61.690500 63.592375 okay
sw4180A-ms98-a-0017 63.592375 76.139375 [silence]
sw4180A-ms98-a-0018 76.139375 83.282625 okay so it's to private individuals who own government instruments of some sort
sw4180A-ms98-a-0019 83.282625 91.017750 [silence]
sw4180A-ms98-a-0020 91.017750 92.900625 uh-huh
sw4180A-ms98-a-0021 92.900625 96.118875 okay so but these are nongovernmental entities
sw4180A-ms98-a-0022 96.118875 99.100500 okay who are holding bonds and whatever
sw4180A-ms98-a-0023 99.100500 101.578625 [silence]
sw4180A-ms98-a-0024 101.578625 103.078875 okay
sw4180A-ms98-a-0025 103.078875 107.117125 yeah that is uh i mean well what what can they i mean
sw4180A-ms98-a-0026 107.117125 118.277625 what's to be done at this point increase that amount for sometime so it will eventually go down or i mean i imagine if you're just servicing the debt you're not really making any progress right
sw4180A-ms98-a-0027 118.277625 130.324875 [silence]
sw4180A-ms98-a-0028 130.324875 135.891625 so we're increasing the debt by an amount equal to eighteen percent of the annual budget
sw4180A-ms98-a-0029 135.891625 143.440250 [silence]
sw4180A-ms98-a-0030 143.440250 145.036000 so
sw4180A-ms98-a-0031 145.036000 151.817750 [silence]
sw4180A-ms98-a-0032 151.817750 153.796500 which is only increasing
sw4180A-ms98-a-0033 153.796500 165.776250 [silence]
sw4180A-ms98-a-0034 165.776250 168.174000 right and uh
sw4180A-ms98-a-0035 168.174000 173.525750 then the question i mean do other countries do this or is this a distinctly American phenomenon 
sw4180A-ms98-a-0036 173.525750 178.608375 [silence]
sw4180A-ms98-a-0037 178.608375 180.033125 uh-huh
sw4180A-ms98-a-0038 180.033125 186.458500 [silence]
sw4180A-ms98-a-0039 186.458500 187.739750 uh-huh
sw4180A-ms98-a-0040 187.739750 189.440875 [silence]
sw4180A-ms98-a-0041 189.440875 195.447000 well and i guess fifty years would pretty much jive with the last big wartime debt
sw4180A-ms98-a-0042 195.447000 199.790875 and they just seemed like it's a good idea why stop [laughter]
sw4180A-ms98-a-0043 199.790875 209.154000 [silence]
sw4180A-ms98-a-0044 209.154000 210.422125 uh-huh
sw4180A-ms98-a-0045 210.422125 215.105375 [silence]
sw4180A-ms98-a-0046 215.105375 216.711250 uh-huh
sw4180A-ms98-a-0047 216.711250 219.322250 so what do you think is the uh
sw4180A-ms98-a-0048 219.322250 222.482750 you know if you were in charge what would you
sw4180A-ms98-a-0049 222.482750 226.101625 what parts would you change to fix this problem
sw4180A-ms98-a-0050 226.101625 231.273250 [silence]
sw4180A-ms98-a-0051 231.273250 235.492250 so at least we wouldn't have that additional uh
sw4180A-ms98-a-0052 235.492250 239.054000 what was it eighteen percent or yeah
sw4180A-ms98-a-0053 239.054000 242.149250 [silence]
sw4180A-ms98-a-0054 242.149250 243.458625 uh-huh
sw4180A-ms98-a-0055 243.458625 254.651250 [silence]

sw4180A-ms98-a-0059 262.927375 264.607750 [silence]
sw4180A-ms98-a-0060 264.607750 272.137250 well it does seem like the uh the quality of the bonds that United States sell would eventually be downgraded doesn't it
sw4180A-ms98-a-0061 272.137250 276.261750 [silence]
sw4180A-ms98-a-0062 276.261750 277.587625 uh-huh
sw4180A-ms98-a-0063 277.587625 279.043750 [silence]

sw4180A-ms98-a-0067 288.839875 293.477125 it is shocking but apparently no one's willing to
sw4180A-ms98-a-0068 293.477125 298.082000 oh i'm not no one but by the time it all ends up in Congress seems
