sw4193B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.486875 [noise]
sw4193B-ms98-a-0002 0.486875 3.708125 so um i pretty much read the paper
sw4193B-ms98-a-0003 3.708125 9.695500 yeah r[ead]- i catch the news sometimes uh but we're so busy usually i just grab the paper at work
sw4193B-ms98-a-0004 9.695500 15.964375 uh we we and we get the really local papers here so can find out what the school board's doing and things like that
sw4193B-ms98-a-0005 15.964375 17.028125 [silence]
sw4193B-ms98-a-0006 17.028125 17.984250 [noise]
sw4193B-ms98-a-0007 17.984250 25.964625 [silence]
sw4193B-ms98-a-0008 25.964625 31.982000 yeah i- i like grab the paper like to see how my stock is doing and things like that because_1 i don't always call my broker and things
sw4193B-ms98-a-0009 31.982000 38.741500 but actually now that i think of it the thing the place where i get most of my information is i have an hour commute in the morning and in the afternoon
sw4193B-ms98-a-0010 38.741500 46.983375 uh so we listen to NPR a lot and we hear we listen to Morning Edition in the morning and Fresh Air and All Things Considered in the afternoon
sw4193B-ms98-a-0011 46.983375 54.453500 so uh and even if we're not listening to the feature stories we certainly tune in at the top of the hour because you got about six minutes of good news and
sw4193B-ms98-a-0012 54.453500 62.463500 [silence]
sw4193B-ms98-a-0013 62.463500 74.025125 yeah i- i'd like to get you know things little s[traight]- a little more from the horse's mouth although i dislike the way that the media for instance distorting the the campaigns like oh big surprise Clinton won in the South you know 
sw4193B-ms98-a-0014 74.025125 79.000875 you know this must mean he's the frontrunner now why because you know all of his region votes on one day
sw4193B-ms98-a-0015 79.000875 80.492375 um
sw4193B-ms98-a-0016 80.492375 86.695500 but you know i- i find especially NPR is fairly unbiased you know i use to watch CNN a lot when i got cable
sw4193B-ms98-a-0017 86.695500 92.779125 because_1 uh they also seem to not lean one way or the other in their reporting
sw4193B-ms98-a-0018 92.779125 104.456750 uh our local papers like the Boston Globe you know where you we have you know you've got the Boston Globe which is extreme in one way and the Manchester Union Leader which like supports Buchanan and things
sw4193B-ms98-a-0019 104.456750 117.012125 so between the [laughter-two] [laughter-of] [laughter-them] you know it's not a lot of and then you've got the Boston Phoenix Weekly with the nine hundred ads in the back you know but other than that there just isn't a lot of you know unbiased local print reporting
sw4193B-ms98-a-0020 117.012125 128.748625 [silence]
sw4193B-ms98-a-0021 128.748625 143.448500 yeah and and i- i don't even bother with local news because it's it's like you know um i'm a pilot so i'm aware of how how they misrepresent you know it's like a guy would do a gears up landing and it'd be there was a crash landing today and our camera crew was there
sw4193B-ms98-a-0022 143.448500 154.974375 uh you know they they or and then of course on sweeps it's how you can get cancer from eating common foods but we're not going to tell you during the thirty second spot you know tune in for a twenty seven part report over the next three weeks
sw4193B-ms98-a-0023 154.974375 155.979000 um
sw4193B-ms98-a-0024 155.979000 158.493000 i really think that um
sw4193B-ms98-a-0025 158.493000 171.003875 you know you have to go to some uh place like NPR that doesn't have a vested interest in you know they don't really care about you know getting two hundred thousand people to watch their shows because_1 they're funded by people who do want to hear this kind of news
sw4193B-ms98-a-0026 171.003875 176.981125 and the other nice thing about my local uh NPR station is they also got monitor radio and the BBC
sw4193B-ms98-a-0027 176.981125 181.696375 through yeah they do [vocalized-noise] this this is basically our all news AM station 10A
sw4193B-ms98-a-0028 181.696375 193.677750 so what you get is you get uh they they've kind of picked up so you get like five AM they give BBC then you've got [vocalized-noise] uh you've got Morning Edition from like six till nine then they pick up again with the BBC
sw4193B-ms98-a-0029 193.677750 205.264875 then in the afternoon you get uh the NPR's talk show and then you've got uh Fresh Air at four All Things Considered till seven then you get Market Place then they give you BBC again
sw4193B-ms98-a-0030 205.264875 214.022625 so it's really you know f[or]- they they've got a bunch of classical music in the afternoon but other than that it's just straight news reporting from about four different sources
sw4193B-ms98-a-0031 214.022625 222.711625 and you know it's kind of neat to see how the BBC reports things differently you know th[ey]- they've got a much different view like reporting South Africa and the Middle East
sw4193B-ms98-a-0032 222.711625 230.796250 um i find that NPR and the BBC has a much more global view than like ABC or one of the US ones
sw4193B-ms98-a-0033 230.796250 232.008625 [silence]
sw4193B-ms98-a-0034 232.008625 241.491625 but you know because_1 you know i find that um a the the American uh electronic media is so uh ethnocentric
sw4193B-ms98-a-0035 241.491625 242.999750 where
sw4193B-ms98-a-0036 242.999750 250.753250 you know they they they don't realize for instance that there's a recession happening in the rest of the world too it's not not just us lucky people
sw4193B-ms98-a-0037 250.753250 251.993875 um
sw4193B-ms98-a-0038 251.993875 253.009250 [silence]
sw4193B-ms98-a-0039 253.009250 267.468750 so you know that's pretty much where i get my information from uh and you know i'll i'll glance through the Boston Globe to get the local news there and i'll glance through the uh like the Milford Cabinet uh the National Telegraph to get the really local news
sw4193B-ms98-a-0040 267.468750 272.987375 yeah it's like the Globe gives you like regional news uh and Boston news
sw4193B-ms98-a-0041 272.987375 276.474250 like my fiance is telling me the Globe sucks uh 
sw4193B-ms98-a-0042 276.474250 290.984125 and and then you get like uh you know the uh the Telegraph and the Cabinet is giving you like how your high school football team did and what's being voted on and you know we got our picture in the T[elegraph]- in the in the Cabinet because_1 we went to the school board meeting
sw4193B-ms98-a-0043 290.984125 299.458000 so you know that that's the kind of level of stuff you get there so you get a real diversity of coverage
