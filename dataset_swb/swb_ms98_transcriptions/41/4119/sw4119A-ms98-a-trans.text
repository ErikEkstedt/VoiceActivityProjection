sw4119A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 13.120125 [noise] so you don't oh uh random drug testing is kind of tough because it it involves this kind of uh trading off of of our individual civil rights for some kind of concept of uh furthering a common good almost
sw4119A-ms98-a-0002 13.120125 17.006250 you know there there's a there's a there's a trade off of our civil rights
sw4119A-ms98-a-0003 17.006250 22.773000 against i guess our employer's right to to having a good job or something

sw4119A-ms98-a-0005 31.038375 32.879125 um-hum
sw4119A-ms98-a-0006 32.879125 86.010250 [silence]
sw4119A-ms98-a-0007 86.010250 95.988125 yeah uh well tha[t's]- that's a good point the only uh the only thing i really disagree with is and and this isn't this isn't exactly disagreement wi[th]-
sw4119A-ms98-a-0008 95.988125 101.170375 i'm not sure that drug testing is strictly aimed to catch people
sw4119A-ms98-a-0009 101.170375 113.474000 but i would think that it also acts as a deterrent if someone if someone knows that there's a threat that that they might get caught it might be that much more of an impetus to to stay away from from whatever the drug is they're they're on
sw4119A-ms98-a-0010 113.474000 120.890500 [silence]
sw4119A-ms98-a-0011 120.890500 131.838375 well i mean i would think that uh if someone knows that there's there's an even greater chance that they['re]- they're going to get caught um having drugs that
sw4119A-ms98-a-0012 131.838375 145.174500 that tha[t]- that would act to discourage them that it would um you know if you know dad's in the other room perhaps you're going to be less likely to steal the the cookies out of the cookie jar because_1 he might be coming in any minute you know
sw4119A-ms98-a-0013 145.174500 167.667625 [silence]

sw4119A-ms98-a-0015 169.515250 199.056000 [silence]
sw4119A-ms98-a-0016 199.056000 207.854875 well the the uh the mayor of Baltimore is a Rhodes Scholar and i i forget his name but one thing that he suggested doing was
sw4119A-ms98-a-0017 207.854875 220.826500 taking the money taking all the money that he gets for uh uh fighting the war on drugs and use it for like drug education to to open up the methadone programs to get the people off drugs that that wanna be off drugs um
sw4119A-ms98-a-0018 220.826500 232.692375 in thinking that that it's we're not doing a good job at fighting the war you know in in trying to crack down on people that are using drugs maybe legalizing them and and trying to help those that you know having the resources there to help someone
sw4119A-ms98-a-0019 232.692375 243.551375 um would be a better idea but and and i agreed with him somewhat i could see his point but uh Switzerland opened up a um uh a park 
sw4119A-ms98-a-0020 243.551375 253.800375 and and for years it just kept getting worse more and more people kept coming to the park and it just kept getting worse and worse and worse until finally the Swiss have they decided to close it down

sw4119A-ms98-a-0022 254.917625 262.313250 so uh i don't know it mean it sounds like it sounds like there aren't going to that there isn't a perfect solution
sw4119A-ms98-a-0023 262.313250 276.963750 [silence]
sw4119A-ms98-a-0024 276.963750 285.240750 that's a good point that's a good point and although although alcohol consumption did jump right after prohibition it did come back down
sw4119A-ms98-a-0025 285.240750 293.126250 [silence]
sw4119A-ms98-a-0026 293.126250 296.365875 yes we do we do
