sw4119B-ms98-a-0003 22.384250 34.361875 uh i don't don't really see the employers as having a whole lot to do with it i've already it the um privilege of being a victim of random drug testing i spent four years in the Marine Corps and had to pee in a bottle on command
sw4119B-ms98-a-0004 34.361875 46.421375 and it was really a really aggravating and time wasting thing to do um the thing that i really hated most about it was the total waste behind it all they would get maybe
sw4119B-ms98-a-0005 46.421375 49.819625 between fifty and two hundred and fifty of us together and it would
sw4119B-ms98-a-0006 49.819625 62.292250 you know we'd lose the whole morning what is that that's a thousand man hours uh to go go through this and in the end they would just be shooting for trying to catch a few specific people it really aggravated me
sw4119B-ms98-a-0007 62.292250 75.260125 i wasn't happy with it at all in fact after i got out i made the decision that i would not work for a company that did that um it just doesn't seem right that a company would do something like that i can appreciate
sw4119B-ms98-a-0008 75.260125 85.870875 um concern over somebody being under the influence while they're at work but they could easily be under the influence of alcohol or any number of other things as well
sw4119B-ms98-a-0009 85.870875 112.095125 [silence]
sw4119B-ms98-a-0010 112.095125 121.881375 now that's implying that um as a punitive kind of a thing as well you definitely want to discourage that is that kind of what you're saying
sw4119B-ms98-a-0011 121.881375 143.685250 [silence]
sw4119B-ms98-a-0012 143.685250 156.768000 yeah well i guess that's a good policy then if uh you're definitely for eradicating drugs from society i'm not so certain that that's a a worthwhile goal right now
sw4119B-ms98-a-0013 156.768000 170.288375 it looks like there's a lot of problems with um you know keeping drugs illegal things that are really scary a lot of people are dying and there's a lot of bloodshed and that that disturbs me i live downtown and uh man
sw4119B-ms98-a-0014 170.288375 181.296000 right diagonal across from campus is uh Teakwood Homes it's the oldest housing project in the country Roosevelt opened it and man there's shootings in there nightly and if it wasn't for the uh
sw4119B-ms98-a-0015 181.296000 193.555375 you know the the high profit margin i don't think it would be going on i don't think that uh we'd have the crime over there that we do and man it really spills over into the neighborhood here as well there's at least one nasty bloody
sw4119B-ms98-a-0016 193.555375 198.929375 violent crime per year um over here where one of the students is a victim
sw4119B-ms98-a-0017 198.929375 219.046500 [silence]
sw4119B-ms98-a-0018 219.046500 220.368625 uh-huh
sw4119B-ms98-a-0019 220.368625 242.092875 [silence]

sw4119B-ms98-a-0021 244.094250 252.995250 [silence]
sw4119B-ms98-a-0022 252.995250 255.871500 [noise] yeah i just saw that in the news here recently
sw4119B-ms98-a-0023 255.871500 262.056875 [silence]
sw4119B-ms98-a-0024 262.056875 267.341375 yeah it really is a dirty mess very difficult to come to conclusions
sw4119B-ms98-a-0025 267.341375 276.697750 i guess one uh one other data point is the old um prohibition here in the US the consequences of that and it's ultimate uh repealment
sw4119B-ms98-a-0026 276.697750 284.669625 [silence]
sw4119B-ms98-a-0027 284.669625 285.882750 yeah
sw4119B-ms98-a-0028 285.882750 293.206375 and it's funny how today in movies and all we really glorify those gangsters and that lifestyle it's kind of spooky
sw4119B-ms98-a-0029 293.206375 294.785750 [silence]
sw4119B-ms98-a-0030 294.785750 298.626000 i gue[ss]- i guess even today in today's movies a lot
