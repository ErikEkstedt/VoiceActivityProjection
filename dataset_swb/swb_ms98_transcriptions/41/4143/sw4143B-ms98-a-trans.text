sw4143B-ms98-a-0007 34.433875 36.318625 oh that sounds great
sw4143B-ms98-a-0008 36.318625 37.687750 [silence]
sw4143B-ms98-a-0009 37.687750 41.604375 well [noise] it's sort of a mixed bag up here uh
sw4143B-ms98-a-0010 41.604375 53.018000 some of the communities have started off with volunteer recycling uh one of the towns near here Cambridge uh had a couple years worth of volunteer recycling i never saw it but
sw4143B-ms98-a-0011 53.018000 66.158375 i know a fellow who was involved in the effort who said that it was amazing just hundreds or you know maybe even more than a thousand cars coming in on the one recycling day a month and they had dozens of volunteers sorting things
sw4143B-ms98-a-0012 66.158375 73.550625 and when the volume reached a certain level the city's Department of Public Works finally decided to do a curbside program
sw4143B-ms98-a-0013 73.550625 76.279000 uh my town Arlington
sw4143B-ms98-a-0014 76.279000 86.582125 has had a uh a similar volunteer program and they just got the Department of Public Works to do a uh
sw4143B-ms98-a-0015 86.582125 92.632375 a daily drop off at their yard where you know people can bring in glass and
sw4143B-ms98-a-0016 92.632375 105.838125 and uh paper and and whatnot and aluminum and tin and some of the other towns around here fact just about all the towns that border Arlington where i live have gone to the curbside recycling and
sw4143B-ms98-a-0017 105.838125 117.214250 i really wish we'd do it here it's just so much easier for people and i think it's it probably results in a larger volume of stuff being recycled if all you have to do is put it out by your curb once a week
sw4143B-ms98-a-0018 117.214250 129.562250 as it is here i sort of resent the effort to you know collect everything until i have a chance to get down to the DPW yard and drop it off you know it's not a huge inconvenience but it's just one more thing to do
sw4143B-ms98-a-0019 129.562250 139.953500 [silence]
sw4143B-ms98-a-0020 139.953500 140.941625 um-hum

sw4143B-ms98-a-0029 182.777500 187.798000 [silence]
sw4143B-ms98-a-0030 187.798000 191.171250 [laughter] boy that's [laughter-a] [laughter-real] problem tha[t]-
sw4143B-ms98-a-0031 191.171250 199.685625 really hate to hear that just regarding the newspapers the one curbside thing we do have in my town actually is every other week they'll pick up newspapers
sw4143B-ms98-a-0032 199.685625 208.713000 which is nice and the rule is that anything that comes in the newspaper even the slick uh ad inserts they'll pick up and that's great
sw4143B-ms98-a-0033 208.713000 209.946500 yeah
sw4143B-ms98-a-0034 209.946500 217.094625 [silence]
sw4143B-ms98-a-0035 217.094625 225.182500 yeah i- i guess it depends on the facility it's going to the thing that i guess the flip side of that and
sw4143B-ms98-a-0036 225.182500 235.483500 in our town anyway is that they won't pick up plastics now and even when they were here and in other towns around here they won't take the so called injection molded things which
sw4143B-ms98-a-0037 235.483500 242.081125 i guess basically are containers that are bigger at the top than at the bottom like yogurt containers typically
sw4143B-ms98-a-0038 242.081125 255.394875 and uh you know i don't know about Dallas but [laughter-i] [laughter-think] people around Boston eat a lot of yogurt so there's just a lot of lot of containers that uh that wind up getting tossed you know without being recycled
sw4143B-ms98-a-0039 255.394875 263.514250 and i don't know what's going on with in terms of capacity it's my impression although i haven't really read anything about it that
sw4143B-ms98-a-0040 263.514250 270.569500 so many towns and cities have started recycling with there might not be enough firms out there
sw4143B-ms98-a-0041 270.569500 275.260000 that are willing to take the uh or you know that'll pay decent money to take the materials
sw4143B-ms98-a-0042 275.260000 281.948625 [silence]
sw4143B-ms98-a-0043 281.948625 283.008875 uh-huh
