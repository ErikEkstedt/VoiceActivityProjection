sw4143A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.652125 [noise] okay
sw4143A-ms98-a-0002 0.652125 8.690125 well um i know so[me]- in some of the one of the smaller towns around Dallas they started curbside recycling
sw4143A-ms98-a-0003 8.690125 16.896000 and that's going really well uh because they i think what ha[ppened]- what what goes on is they get like dis[counts]- 
sw4143A-ms98-a-0004 16.896000 28.135000 they get charged not by the amount of trash they do well they get charged by for the pick up of the trash and not for the recyclables
sw4143A-ms98-a-0005 28.135000 34.827625 so it's so you get p[ay]- you pay less to have your trash picked up becau[se]- if you presort all out all your tra[sh]- all your recyclables
sw4143A-ms98-a-0006 34.827625 36.255125 [silence]

sw4143A-ms98-a-0018 140.242875 142.240250 but no place will take them_1
sw4143A-ms98-a-0019 142.240250 148.969500 and you know i mean they're real specific you know you can do your newspapers but you have to take all the slick stuff out
