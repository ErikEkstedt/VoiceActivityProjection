sw4177A-ms98-a-0002 0.198750 5.326500 hi so do you think you get good coverage from the sources that you have
sw4177A-ms98-a-0003 5.326500 15.431375 [silence]
sw4177A-ms98-a-0004 15.431375 18.372000 do you watch a lot of TV to get the news then
sw4177A-ms98-a-0005 18.372000 23.577250 [silence]
sw4177A-ms98-a-0006 23.577250 24.540625 um
sw4177A-ms98-a-0007 24.540625 26.022375 [silence]
sw4177A-ms98-a-0008 26.022375 33.916375 well i read um i get a bunch of different things i get a newspaper every day and i try to a[t]- at least have a few minutes to look through that
sw4177A-ms98-a-0009 33.916375 35.534875 and i look through uh
sw4177A-ms98-a-0010 35.534875 40.326000 i get a Newsweek every week which i- i pretty much read that cover to cover [noise]
sw4177A-ms98-a-0011 40.326000 44.960625 and i as far as you know that satisfies most of the short term news i get
sw4177A-ms98-a-0012 44.960625 48.429625 uh don't watch much TV don't have enough time
sw4177A-ms98-a-0013 48.429625 59.078250 and uh don't listen to the radio too much especially the news channels or anything like that you know they might give you a little blurbs like this happened or that happened and that's about all i ever hear of it
sw4177A-ms98-a-0014 59.078250 60.028750 uh
sw4177A-ms98-a-0015 60.028750 65.059875 but most of my news probably comes from Newsweek and for the longer term i- i read
sw4177A-ms98-a-0016 65.059875 65.885625 um
sw4177A-ms98-a-0017 65.885625 71.181000 like Scientific American and and uh Reader's Digest and some of those other types of magazines 
sw4177A-ms98-a-0018 71.181000 79.321625 that come out which they the news isn't like immediate what you'd generally think of as news but it's recent material
sw4177A-ms98-a-0019 79.321625 87.669000 yeah it's it's more in depth less broad well actually it's probably isn't less broad but it's just more in depth and uh
sw4177A-ms98-a-0020 87.669000 94.978875 it's it's more sig[nificant]- it's more just significant information you know it's the big events not the little events
sw4177A-ms98-a-0021 94.978875 100.019125 not the fact that there was a big auto accident down at the corner of Broad and Main you know
sw4177A-ms98-a-0022 100.019125 101.027250 [silence]
sw4177A-ms98-a-0023 101.027250 106.135625 yes or they're making making time because they have to fill in an hour's worth of news
sw4177A-ms98-a-0024 106.135625 112.004875 um i get kind of bored watching TV actually when i watch the news on TV because
sw4177A-ms98-a-0025 112.004875 117.485250 it goes so slow and then there's nothing that you know really is like oh so exciting
sw4177A-ms98-a-0026 117.485250 124.487875 [silence]
sw4177A-ms98-a-0027 124.487875 130.955625 [noise] yeah that that's about what it ends up being listen to the news to hear the traffic report or something [laughter]
sw4177A-ms98-a-0028 130.955625 138.975250 [silence]
sw4177A-ms98-a-0029 138.975250 147.152000 yeah i think they're about the same i you know they they certainly have a very similar uh charter at least in my mind
sw4177A-ms98-a-0030 147.152000 148.390500 and uh
sw4177A-ms98-a-0031 148.390500 150.810875 uh what what kind of um
sw4177A-ms98-a-0032 150.810875 156.853500 what kind of news normally interests you i mean what do you what what do you find interesting versus what do you find boring
sw4177A-ms98-a-0033 156.853500 168.011500 [silence]
sw4177A-ms98-a-0034 168.011500 169.265375 um-hum
sw4177A-ms98-a-0035 169.265375 171.493875 [silence]
sw4177A-ms98-a-0036 171.493875 174.060875 i think it will um
sw4177A-ms98-a-0037 174.060875 177.390375 they they keep claiming it's going to have a big influence but
sw4177A-ms98-a-0038 177.390375 178.802750 we've yet to see it
sw4177A-ms98-a-0039 178.802750 182.081000 [vocalized-noise] it's real short term yet though i mean it's only been
sw4177A-ms98-a-0040 182.081000 185.297750 three months or something like that since that happened so
sw4177A-ms98-a-0041 185.297750 189.579625 but they like to tell us that it's going to be important [laughter]
sw4177A-ms98-a-0042 189.579625 191.822500 i think it is too
sw4177A-ms98-a-0043 191.822500 201.334875 [silence]
sw4177A-ms98-a-0044 201.334875 204.998375 yeah i- i think that's a possibility um
sw4177A-ms98-a-0045 204.998375 210.083250 it we might also be helped though because it it'll be easier to do business over there too
sw4177A-ms98-a-0046 210.083250 213.414875 for the companies that already have a presence over there
sw4177A-ms98-a-0047 213.414875 216.972500 and uh i know of at least one company that
sw4177A-ms98-a-0048 216.972500 223.484500 specifically went over there and established a presence before nineteen ninety two so that they would have it when it came time
sw4177A-ms98-a-0049 223.484500 230.556250 yep because once you're in there then you can easily expand but getting in after nineteen ninety two is more difficult
sw4177A-ms98-a-0050 230.556250 234.557125 [silence]
sw4177A-ms98-a-0051 234.557125 236.153625 [noise] yes
sw4177A-ms98-a-0052 236.153625 243.188500 and there's already a lot of evidence that they are being very protectionist even amongst themselves they're being somewhat protectionist you know
sw4177A-ms98-a-0053 243.188500 246.075500 like England doesn't want to do one thing and
sw4177A-ms98-a-0054 246.075500 252.988125 and Sweden doesn't want to do other thing and they're they've all got their own reasons which have to be resolved yet
sw4177A-ms98-a-0055 252.988125 258.118750 and some of it i mean is i'm sure within those people's minds it's quite justified
sw4177A-ms98-a-0056 258.118750 262.491000 [silence]
sw4177A-ms98-a-0057 262.491000 263.806375 um-hum
sw4177A-ms98-a-0058 263.806375 264.880125 [silence]
sw4177A-ms98-a-0059 264.880125 267.744875 before they open up their borders to everyone
sw4177A-ms98-a-0060 267.744875 273.852500 [noise] um what is the um do you watch anything like with sports or anything like that
sw4177A-ms98-a-0061 273.852500 278.090750 [silence]
sw4177A-ms98-a-0062 278.090750 280.000000 [laughter]
sw4177A-ms98-a-0063 280.000000 281.977375 against your will
sw4177A-ms98-a-0064 281.977375 284.688125 [silence]
sw4177A-ms98-a-0065 284.688125 286.482375 [laughter]
sw4177A-ms98-a-0066 286.482375 289.470500 yeah at least you guys have a remote control
sw4177A-ms98-a-0067 289.470500 290.563500 [silence]
sw4177A-ms98-a-0068 290.563500 295.242125 it's sometimes better to not have one of those course you can always mislocate it
sw4177A-ms98-a-0069 295.242125 298.626000 or misplace it i mean not mislocate it but misplace it and
