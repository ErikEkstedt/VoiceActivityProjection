sw4172B-ms98-a-0012 68.769250 71.634125 you know i didn't really have to
sw4172B-ms98-a-0013 71.634125 79.209000 think about an exercise routine because i was always doing something that more or less required exercise
sw4172B-ms98-a-0014 79.209000 87.670125 but um i've been in a job lately where i've been working some really long hours and some nights and weekends and
sw4172B-ms98-a-0015 87.670125 98.795125 it makes you you lose every bit of [vocalized-noise] muscle tone you ever thought about having and then to try to work your way back from that is [laughter] is why i can't really get
