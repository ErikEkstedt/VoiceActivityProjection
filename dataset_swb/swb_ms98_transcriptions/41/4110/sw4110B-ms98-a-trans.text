sw4110B-ms98-a-0009 40.509125 46.740125 uh there's a lake called Lake Lanier here in Georgia that we went to and we camped out on the island and we kind of

sw4110B-ms98-a-0013 61.237250 71.788125 i haven't been [vocalized-noise] lately i have i've i've wanted to lately but there's a i'd like to i need to get some equipment first and i don't really have the money for it now i've i've been looking into like buying uh
sw4110B-ms98-a-0014 71.788125 76.374500 uh a tent of some sort but they're really expensive like the good ones
sw4110B-ms98-a-0015 76.374500 88.210875 so that's kind of put a cramp in my camping style so late lately i've just kind of for outdoorsy type stuff i've pretty much been you know one day trips where i'll i'll maybe drive up to Alabama somewhere like in a
sw4110B-ms98-a-0016 88.210875 97.674000 northern Alabama i'm into rock climbing a little bit so so if one of my roommates has some r[opes]- ropes and stuff and sometimes we go up there and
sw4110B-ms98-a-0017 97.674000 107.076375 climb around on the rocks and stuff but usually it's a one day affair it's not a [overnighter/overnight] type thing but i'd like to i'd like to really get into that kind of thing

sw4110B-ms98-a-0032 148.463250 160.846750 and uh someone one of us had a tent but not all of us had sleeping bags and it was kind of a it was late summer but it get it go[t]- it got really cold at night a lot colder than we thought it would so the sleeping bag was just big enough to
sw4110B-ms98-a-0033 160.846750 168.390000 was just small enough so that it didn't act[ually]- cover everyone so it was kind of uh a wrestling match for the [laughter] for uh
sw4110B-ms98-a-0034 168.390000 175.210125 you know warmth so we we we we roughed it until about four in the morning and we were all just freezing so we got up and
