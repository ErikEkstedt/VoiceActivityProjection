sw4192B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.989875 [noise]
sw4192B-ms98-a-0002 0.989875 10.781625 well uh i think air pollution is a pretty big problem right now and it's i mean i think it's a real bad problem i don't think that a lot is really being done about it at this point
sw4192B-ms98-a-0003 10.781625 23.681500 and there's just things like uh for a i think that cars especially here in the United States are just a major source of the pollution when you consider that most people have at least one automobile and people drive around all the time
sw4192B-ms98-a-0004 23.681500 34.210500 and i think you know if you just totaled up i don't know any of the exact figures but all the millions of cars that are driving around spewing out carbon monoxide all the time i think you're going to end up with a pretty big uh number
sw4192B-ms98-a-0005 34.210500 35.492500 [silence]
sw4192B-ms98-a-0006 35.492500 42.985500 um and if you look at other countries like in the third world and stuff where people ride bikes and all that i'm sure that their uh
sw4192B-ms98-a-0007 42.985500 54.724125 air quality is much better than ours just as a result of their lack of having cars like if you look at Los Angeles i mean they've they said that the major reason that it's so smoggy there is because_1 they all sit and drive down the freeway everyday
sw4192B-ms98-a-0008 54.724125 64.258000 [silence]
sw4192B-ms98-a-0009 64.258000 65.773500 uh-huh
sw4192B-ms98-a-0010 65.773500 67.299250 [silence]
sw4192B-ms98-a-0011 67.299250 68.712000 right
sw4192B-ms98-a-0012 68.712000 75.722750 [silence]
sw4192B-ms98-a-0013 75.722750 77.485250 uh-huh
sw4192B-ms98-a-0014 77.485250 84.194375 [silence]

sw4192B-ms98-a-0017 88.744000 92.997375 right and there was j[ust]- i just saw today that uh
sw4192B-ms98-a-0018 92.997375 102.497500 President Bush they were had new a new regulation out that was going to put a canister to collect some of the exhaust fumes on most new cars and he uh
sw4192B-ms98-a-0019 102.497500 110.497375 is not going to let that regulation pass through because he says that well it's going to cost too much money and take too many jobs away from the people up in Michigan
sw4192B-ms98-a-0020 110.497375 121.478875 and i just think that's ridiculous that i mean if they've developed the technology to remove some of the harmful pollutants that come out of people's exhaust pipe and and not implementing it is just seems kind of ludicrous to me 
sw4192B-ms98-a-0021 121.478875 123.516125 [silence]
sw4192B-ms98-a-0022 123.516125 125.003125 uh-huh

sw4192B-ms98-a-0032 148.977875 153.977250 [silence]
sw4192B-ms98-a-0033 153.977250 161.746000 right exactly uh the another thing i don't know here in the Midwest in Indiana at least we produce most of our energy burning coal
sw4192B-ms98-a-0034 161.746000 172.455500 and if you just look at some of these there's a coal burning electricity plant here in town and you can just sit there and watch the the smoke stacks and the amount of pollution that just pours out of there
sw4192B-ms98-a-0035 172.455500 186.703125 i use to live right next to this plant and every single day you would go out and your car would just have you know it's not like three inches of dust or anything but you can see the dust that had come out of this smoke stack and just fallen right down on your car
sw4192B-ms98-a-0036 186.703125 195.235375 and you know they say that the the coal we burn here in Indiana is responsible for a large part of the acid rain that they have up in New York state and in Canada and all that
sw4192B-ms98-a-0037 195.235375 202.497000 and it's just you know it's ridiculous when we could be spending the money to develop the technology to you know clean up some of these uh 
sw4192B-ms98-a-0038 202.497000 212.762750 sources of pollution like the smoke stacks but then the big businesses say well we can't do it because it's going to cost us too much money and it's like well we kind of got to think a little bit more forward instead of
sw4192B-ms98-a-0039 212.762750 218.277500 you know we're not going to make as much money this year because we're trying to clean things up i just it kind of
sw4192B-ms98-a-0040 218.277500 219.989375 bothers me [laughter]
sw4192B-ms98-a-0041 219.989375 222.997500 [silence]

sw4192B-ms98-a-0057 271.964125 272.996250 [silence]
sw4192B-ms98-a-0058 272.996250 285.178000 yeah all and all i think that we really i mean al[most]- if you look at almost any industry it's it's producing so much pollution i mean they're spewing out just tons of this atmospheric garbage every single year
sw4192B-ms98-a-0059 285.178000 298.626000 and something really ought to be done because it it's basically we don't see the problem right now and like you said e[ven]- the pollution that we're putting out now is not really going to affect anybody for twenty thirty years so i don't think it's got i mean the the p[ast]-
