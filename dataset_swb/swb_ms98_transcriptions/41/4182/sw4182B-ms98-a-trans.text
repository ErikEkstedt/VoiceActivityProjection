sw4182B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 6.031500 [noise] okay um so we're talking about drug testing on and how we feel about it in in in the work place
sw4182B-ms98-a-0002 6.031500 7.580125 [silence]
sw4182B-ms98-a-0003 7.580125 12.179625 yeah yeah my my gut feeling is to
sw4182B-ms98-a-0004 12.179625 22.340750 probably side uh on the the Bill of Rights side of this and say that this it's an unfair [vocalized-noise] invasion of privacy i- i um 
sw4182B-ms98-a-0005 22.340750 25.136625 it i have to say that i
sw4182B-ms98-a-0006 25.136625 27.496375 m[y]- from my political point of view
sw4182B-ms98-a-0007 27.496375 38.973625 i tend to be i tend to sort of fall in the liberal side of a lot of issues but at the same time uh part of my own picture of the way [vocalized-noise] politics should work in this country is there also should be 
sw4182B-ms98-a-0008 38.973625 51.455875 uh regulatory controls on things and i think that when you have situations where uh an uh a working individual uh could do damage for instance a an airline pilot 
sw4182B-ms98-a-0009 51.455875 60.553000 uh you know or or somebody who's driving a public carrier like like truck drivers and stuff like that i think that there is a uh far more substantial issue 
sw4182B-ms98-a-0010 60.553000 75.330250 uh at hand but i think there other ways um other than than doing things like drug testing to monitor the way um people behave um i think a g[ood]- for instance a good manager should be able to tell that somebody's got a personal problem um 
sw4182B-ms98-a-0011 75.330250 87.002625 in in like a clerical environment or a a work environment like i'm a i'm a computer programmer so [noise] if i were indulging in activities like that or one of my colleagues were um 
sw4182B-ms98-a-0012 87.002625 91.654125 it would seem to me pretty easy to to tell if their performance was suffering for it
sw4182B-ms98-a-0013 91.654125 93.984875 i don't know how do you feel about these things 
sw4182B-ms98-a-0014 93.984875 119.556000 [silence]
sw4182B-ms98-a-0015 119.556000 121.012375 um-hum
sw4182B-ms98-a-0016 121.012375 122.495000 um-hum
sw4182B-ms98-a-0017 122.495000 129.544000 [silence]
sw4182B-ms98-a-0018 129.544000 133.511625 sure sure and that could ruin somebody's life
sw4182B-ms98-a-0019 133.511625 135.839250 even if they were vindicated
sw4182B-ms98-a-0020 135.839250 161.081000 [silence]
sw4182B-ms98-a-0021 161.081000 162.378500 sure
sw4182B-ms98-a-0022 162.378500 165.666875 [silence]
sw4182B-ms98-a-0023 165.666875 166.917000 um-hum
sw4182B-ms98-a-0024 166.917000 167.929250 [silence]
sw4182B-ms98-a-0025 167.929250 180.716000 well i have to say i'm i'm a child of the sixties and uh it it you know i grew up and when i was young i flirted around with some of that stuff like a lot of my friends did and i saw a lot of my friends ruin their lives or not not really 
sw4182B-ms98-a-0026 180.716000 188.436125 i don't know i guess i saw a couple of friends ruin their lives an[d]- that sort of thing but i didn't see most of them ruin their lives with it in fact most of them went through it like a phase like 
sw4182B-ms98-a-0027 188.436125 196.476250 you know most teenagers will drink for a little while and then when they you know have to start you know working and that sort of thing they tend to cut it back to drinking on the weekends or whatever
sw4182B-ms98-a-0028 196.476250 198.741125 and and they become adults about it
sw4182B-ms98-a-0029 198.741125 205.580000 and uh i[n]- in fact my attitudes about the kinds of drug problems that we have in this country
sw4182B-ms98-a-0030 205.580000 213.532250 uh are are that i think that the government should ad[ministrate]- administrate it in a com[pletely]- you know in a completely different manner i think it would be a
sw4182B-ms98-a-0031 213.532250 225.881500 a good source of revenue i think there's some some evidence about the way this stuff has been handled in Europe that shows that it can be controlled in different ways but that's sort of moving off the topic at hand here and i you know the the 
sw4182B-ms98-a-0032 225.881500 229.685500 fact of the matter is is i think that issues like this really
sw4182B-ms98-a-0033 229.685500 240.477500 really are i mean to a certain extent they involve the whole question of liberty and a person's right to privacy and that sort of thing because uh uh you know i mean 
sw4182B-ms98-a-0034 240.477500 250.412125 yeah and and uh it it i you know the fact of the matter is is i think that that an adult responsible worker doesn't want to
sw4182B-ms98-a-0035 250.412125 260.507875 have this kind of thing in his life if it's going to im[pact]- uh have an impact upon his ability to make a a a living and and you know and and keep his livelihood coming in 
sw4182B-ms98-a-0036 260.507875 268.640000 [silence]
sw4182B-ms98-a-0037 268.640000 278.323250 sure an[d]- and and uh and and so you know it's uh i so anyway i guess that we're we're largely in agreement in that uh
sw4182B-ms98-a-0038 278.323250 288.011000 case and uh and in fact i think that uh because you know i mean i it's it's literally i you know i'm in my late thirties now and it's easily been um almost 
sw4182B-ms98-a-0039 288.011000 298.850000 jeez man maybe twenty years almost since i last had any of that that sort of stuff uh around me but at the same time i don't think that that necessarily gives me a right to s[ay]-
