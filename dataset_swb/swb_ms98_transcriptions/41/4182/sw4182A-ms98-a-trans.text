sw4182A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.554250 [noise]
sw4182A-ms98-a-0002 0.554250 5.257250 [silence]
sw4182A-ms98-a-0003 5.257250 8.956000 correct i- i assume this is involuntary drug testing from employers
sw4182A-ms98-a-0004 8.956000 91.854875 [silence]
sw4182A-ms98-a-0005 91.854875 93.253375 right 
sw4182A-ms98-a-0006 93.253375 107.127875 well i- i- i- i tend to look at it like uh right i mean without without uh you know a suspicion of of you know reasonable suspicion of of something going on i- i would have to probably tend to uh 
sw4182A-ms98-a-0007 107.127875 120.251500 uh agree that at least in most cases it should not be done i- i also my my big question of course is you know this is a pretty steep thing for uh something the last i heard was not a hundred percent effective 
sw4182A-ms98-a-0008 120.251500 130.377000 or you know accurate uh with it not being a hundred percent accurate that that leaves open you know quite a bit of room for you know false positive
sw4182A-ms98-a-0009 130.377000 131.959500 uh
sw4182A-ms98-a-0010 131.959500 134.592625 absolutely you know that that
sw4182A-ms98-a-0011 134.592625 135.604125 [silence]
sw4182A-ms98-a-0012 135.604125 140.193125 sure sure because i mean it's like uh someone goes on trial for something
sw4182A-ms98-a-0013 140.193125 144.411875 the press lets everybody know so no matter how many times you're acquitted
sw4182A-ms98-a-0014 144.411875 153.415000 but uh so there is that i mean but also you know as as someone who does not use any controlled substances i 
sw4182A-ms98-a-0015 153.415000 161.842500 you know part of me says well as long as it's accurate i don't care if they test and if someone is using it they should be you know caught for it as long as it's illegal 
sw4182A-ms98-a-0016 161.842500 166.479625 uh so th[at]- you know that that is a tough things to juggle between the two
sw4182A-ms98-a-0017 166.479625 167.869500 uh
sw4182A-ms98-a-0018 167.869500 238.427875 [silence]
sw4182A-ms98-a-0019 238.427875 241.118000 [vocalized-noise] it also involves due process
sw4182A-ms98-a-0020 241.118000 259.823250 [silence]
sw4182A-ms98-a-0021 259.823250 267.083625 and and that does bring up a good point in that if it's not having an impact then what right does the uh employer have to 
sw4182A-ms98-a-0022 267.083625 269.345125 you know to get information about that
sw4182A-ms98-a-0023 269.345125 289.190750 [silence]
sw4182A-ms98-a-0024 289.190750 291.470000 [laughter]
sw4182A-ms98-a-0025 291.470000 293.377000 [laughter]
