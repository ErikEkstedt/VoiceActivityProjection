sw4114A-ms98-a-0003 2.393750 13.710250 [silence]
sw4114A-ms98-a-0004 13.710250 19.330625 right i guess uh i don't know what part of New Jersey you're in but i guess it's uh fairly industrial
sw4114A-ms98-a-0005 19.330625 22.822375 [silence]
sw4114A-ms98-a-0006 22.822375 24.486250 right uh-huh

sw4114A-ms98-a-0014 39.496750 40.800000 right
sw4114A-ms98-a-0015 40.800000 53.686625 well i don't know about you but i've always considered automobiles to be probably the the prime contributor i mean there's a lot of contributors but it seems that automobiles would probably do more than their fair share of that
sw4114A-ms98-a-0016 53.686625 55.116750 yeah
sw4114A-ms98-a-0017 55.116750 62.630625 [silence]
sw4114A-ms98-a-0018 62.630625 75.626500 that's yeah that's that's a big issue is you know a lot of states don't have a uh inspection law so you get you get a lot of people out there without ETR emission control systems on their cars and things like that
sw4114A-ms98-a-0019 75.626500 78.361750 [silence]
sw4114A-ms98-a-0020 78.361750 80.547125 yeah and it's like
sw4114A-ms98-a-0021 80.547125 81.583875 [silence]
sw4114A-ms98-a-0022 81.583875 82.891250 sure
sw4114A-ms98-a-0023 82.891250 85.612250 [silence]
sw4114A-ms98-a-0024 85.612250 95.484625 right i guess from what i hear though uh next year Ford is coming out with their electric cars they're actually coming out with the first prototypes in California
sw4114A-ms98-a-0025 95.484625 99.688875 [silence]
sw4114A-ms98-a-0026 99.688875 100.951500 yeah
sw4114A-ms98-a-0027 100.951500 103.568125 [silence]
sw4114A-ms98-a-0028 103.568125 106.920500 right i hope i i'm hoping that comes along quick
sw4114A-ms98-a-0029 106.920500 107.424625 [laughter]
sw4114A-ms98-a-0030 107.424625 119.574500 uh i was reading a an article in Time the other day about the ozone layer and how fast that's going and i guess it's it's really disappearing a lot quicker than people realize and i know that's not due to uh
sw4114A-ms98-a-0031 119.574500 125.910000 it's not due to to gasoline or to you know carbon monoxide so much as the CFC's but
sw4114A-ms98-a-0032 125.910000 127.058875 [silence]
sw4114A-ms98-a-0033 127.058875 129.554000 uh yeah i think that's a that's a contributor definitely
sw4114A-ms98-a-0034 129.554000 131.357000 [silence]
sw4114A-ms98-a-0035 131.357000 132.523625 right
sw4114A-ms98-a-0036 132.523625 136.108500 [silence]
sw4114A-ms98-a-0037 136.108500 137.028750 right
sw4114A-ms98-a-0038 137.028750 139.913500 [silence]
sw4114A-ms98-a-0039 139.913500 144.868250 yeah i guess right now what they're what they're primarily worried about is third world countries
sw4114A-ms98-a-0040 144.868250 152.169125 because i guess United States and and Russia have kind of taken the lead in terms of eliminating CFC production but
sw4114A-ms98-a-0041 152.169125 153.154375 it
sw4114A-ms98-a-0042 153.154375 154.139500 go ahead
sw4114A-ms98-a-0043 154.139500 160.952000 [silence]
sw4114A-ms98-a-0044 160.952000 162.279625 um-hum
sw4114A-ms98-a-0045 162.279625 172.028750 [silence]
sw4114A-ms98-a-0046 172.028750 179.916000 right and that's one of the arguments that the Third World countries have been using is that basically they don't want to have to pay for our mistakes
sw4114A-ms98-a-0047 179.916000 180.750125 [laughter]
sw4114A-ms98-a-0048 180.750125 184.277625 if if that makes any sense uh in terms of
sw4114A-ms98-a-0049 184.277625 187.144875 [silence]
sw4114A-ms98-a-0050 187.144875 193.491250 exactly exactly uh those of kind of yeah those are joining arguments but uh
sw4114A-ms98-a-0051 193.491250 198.776375 i don't know that's that's kind of an interesting situation there uh what they don't realize
sw4114A-ms98-a-0052 198.776375 206.773625 those third world countries what they don't realize is how quickly the ozone is depleting i guess the latest figures are up to fifty percent at the poles
sw4114A-ms98-a-0053 206.773625 213.927750 and it's it's increasing even as far near the Equator as like Florida and Cuba and those places
sw4114A-ms98-a-0054 213.927750 216.437875 so it's kind of an interesting situation it's not
sw4114A-ms98-a-0055 216.437875 216.696625 [laughter]
sw4114A-ms98-a-0056 216.696625 219.034250 not a real good one actually but
sw4114A-ms98-a-0057 219.034250 222.910625 [silence]
sw4114A-ms98-a-0058 222.910625 223.626750 yeah
sw4114A-ms98-a-0059 223.626750 226.007250 [silence]
sw4114A-ms98-a-0060 226.007250 227.247000 uh-huh
sw4114A-ms98-a-0061 227.247000 228.489750 yeah
sw4114A-ms98-a-0062 228.489750 234.983125 yeah you don't get that that source of cleansing anymore are have you been in big cities a long time
sw4114A-ms98-a-0063 234.983125 240.343750 [silence]
sw4114A-ms98-a-0064 240.343750 245.994625 okay so you've got yeah those are actually areas that are hit pretty hard i would think
sw4114A-ms98-a-0065 245.994625 252.520750 [silence]
sw4114A-ms98-a-0066 252.520750 255.501125 yeah Denver's definitely yeah that's one of the worst
sw4114A-ms98-a-0067 255.501125 258.009875 [silence]
sw4114A-ms98-a-0068 258.009875 259.332375 sure
sw4114A-ms98-a-0069 259.332375 264.490375 yeah Denver's that that real good uh that real good uh example of sitting in a valley
sw4114A-ms98-a-0070 264.490375 270.885500 kind of like Mexico City does i guess Mexico City is historically been one of the worst in the in in the world for that 
sw4114A-ms98-a-0071 270.885500 280.827375 but i've been pretty lucky i've lived in cities that really haven't had that much of a problem although uh i'm really kind of based in Orlando Florida and
sw4114A-ms98-a-0072 280.827375 290.042625 there you can tell that it's getting worse i mean it it definitely it's not at a level comparable to Los Angeles or Denver but you can
sw4114A-ms98-a-0073 290.042625 291.466375 [silence]
sw4114A-ms98-a-0074 291.466375 293.044875 exactly
sw4114A-ms98-a-0075 293.044875 299.522000 yeah and there's not that much in terms of of public transportation down there there is but it's kind of it's
