sw4114B-ms98-a-0002 0.596625 2.750750 [silence]
sw4114B-ms98-a-0003 2.750750 5.240125 uh it's pretty good you know you get uh
sw4114B-ms98-a-0004 5.240125 14.482125 closer to the uh coast here and you do get a good bit of uh smog and stuff especially from all the uh fuel cracking towers and chemical plants
sw4114B-ms98-a-0005 14.482125 18.910500 [silence]
sw4114B-ms98-a-0006 18.910500 23.651500 [noise] yeah it's when you get further east towards New York City it gets very industrial
sw4114B-ms98-a-0007 23.651500 33.881000 but i'm i'm about uh thirty miles west of there so you have uh actually green trees and such that you don't notice that that other part of New Jersey exists actually very
sw4114B-ms98-a-0008 33.881000 40.204875 yeah you you go even a few wi[de]- miles out and you got uh farms and everything so you relatively clear air
sw4114B-ms98-a-0009 40.204875 41.648375 but uh
sw4114B-ms98-a-0010 41.648375 52.896750 [silence]
sw4114B-ms98-a-0011 52.896750 59.007125 oh de[finitely]- definitely it's uh you know there are a large number of them on the road they're all
sw4114B-ms98-a-0012 59.007125 63.543875 yeah going and a lot of them are in relatively poor repair
sw4114B-ms98-a-0013 63.543875 74.888375 [silence]
sw4114B-ms98-a-0014 74.888375 79.003625 oh e[ven]- even where you do have the inspections you know the inspection is once a year
sw4114B-ms98-a-0015 79.003625 85.985375 you get the car that's in the accident and muffler falls off or something and guy keeps driving along for long period of time after that
sw4114B-ms98-a-0016 85.985375 94.868375 [silence]
sw4114B-ms98-a-0017 94.868375 100.302750 yeah that and i think also some of the uh car companies are coming out with uh gas powered fleets
sw4114B-ms98-a-0018 100.302750 104.484375 so you natural gas powered rather than uh gasoline
sw4114B-ms98-a-0019 104.484375 124.974250 [silence]
sw4114B-ms98-a-0020 124.974250 127.262875 it it is coming from cars though
sw4114B-ms98-a-0021 127.262875 129.429375 [silence]
sw4114B-ms98-a-0022 129.429375 140.439625 i mean the uh car air conditioners is one of the major leaking sources of uh the uh freon which is one of the major fluor[ocarbons]- [chlorofar/chlorofluorocarbons] -[chloro]fluorocarbons
sw4114B-ms98-a-0023 140.439625 151.242125 [silence]
sw4114B-ms98-a-0024 151.242125 153.475375 well it it
sw4114B-ms98-a-0025 153.475375 161.704750 no it's the type of thing there that uh you know the Third World countries are less industrial and they want to become industrial
sw4114B-ms98-a-0026 161.704750 168.202250 so they're on the different part of the cycle of the US the US used you know all the air pollution stuff
sw4114B-ms98-a-0027 168.202250 173.007750 and air polluting technologies to get where it is today
sw4114B-ms98-a-0028 173.007750 183.044375 [silence]
sw4114B-ms98-a-0029 183.044375 188.750250 or or they want the right to make the same mistakes themselves to bootstrap them up to the way where we got to
sw4114B-ms98-a-0030 188.750250 213.525000 [silence]
sw4114B-ms98-a-0031 213.525000 214.475500 yeah
sw4114B-ms98-a-0032 214.475500 217.476000 [silence]
sw4114B-ms98-a-0033 217.476000 223.011875 no well you also have the very close related thing of the uh rain forest destruction
sw4114B-ms98-a-0034 223.011875 227.119875 which is the main source of what's clearing out the atmosphere and
sw4114B-ms98-a-0035 227.119875 229.184875 replacing some of the pollutants
sw4114B-ms98-a-0036 229.184875 234.994250 [silence]
sw4114B-ms98-a-0037 234.994250 240.990375 mostly i've mostly been in the east coast so that's going between Atlanta Washington DC area
sw4114B-ms98-a-0038 240.990375 241.961875 [vocalized-noise]
sw4114B-ms98-a-0039 241.961875 245.514625 [silence]
sw4114B-ms98-a-0040 245.514625 259.083000 well not not as hard as some places out west because you don't get the uh major pollution sources as you do out in Denver with the with the inversion and Los Angeles and a[ll]- rest of California which is just terrible it sounds
sw4114B-ms98-a-0041 259.083000 265.980250 [silence]
sw4114B-ms98-a-0042 265.980250 267.032750 uh-huh

sw4114B-ms98-a-0044 269.608875 270.953125 yeah
sw4114B-ms98-a-0045 270.953125 288.801250 [silence]
sw4114B-ms98-a-0046 288.801250 294.573125 yeah there it's almost all automobiles because there's not that much in the way of uh heavy industry you know that would be causing it 
sw4114B-ms98-a-0047 294.573125 297.543000 [silence]
sw4114B-ms98-a-0048 297.543000 298.515750 um-hum
