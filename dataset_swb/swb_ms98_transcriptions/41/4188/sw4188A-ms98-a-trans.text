sw4188A-ms98-a-0003 1.854500 15.743000 sure uh recycling in this community has uh been a problem for the past two years i moved down here two years ago from a community that ha[d]- had recycling
sw4188A-ms98-a-0004 15.743000 28.159875 band this particular town uh does not offer municipal trash services so we are all uh under obligation to get our own trash hauled away
sw4188A-ms98-a-0005 28.159875 41.251500 and when i talk to the local trash haulers about recycling they said that uh they could haul it to the recycling site but it would be about twenty dollars a month more
sw4188A-ms98-a-0006 41.251500 47.690750 so it was uh fairly amazing to me that this thing that they are trying to mandate throughout the state
sw4188A-ms98-a-0007 47.690750 52.221375 uh was being snubbed in this particular town
sw4188A-ms98-a-0008 52.221375 57.352750 [silence]
sw4188A-ms98-a-0009 57.352750 58.658875 no
sw4188A-ms98-a-0010 58.658875 60.904125 no we don't uh
sw4188A-ms98-a-0011 60.904125 62.519500 [silence]
sw4188A-ms98-a-0012 62.519500 68.706250 as i said we we are responsible for finding our own trash pick up
sw4188A-ms98-a-0013 68.706250 76.107375 and all the uh trash haulers in this area will take the uh the sorted trash and
sw4188A-ms98-a-0014 76.107375 85.511000 bring the recyclables to a uh a recycling center but they charge about twenty dollars or more a month for that particular service 
sw4188A-ms98-a-0015 85.511000 97.302500 [silence]
sw4188A-ms98-a-0016 97.302500 98.449000 um-hum
sw4188A-ms98-a-0017 98.449000 100.239500 [silence]
sw4188A-ms98-a-0018 100.239500 101.415625 right
sw4188A-ms98-a-0019 101.415625 105.159375 [silence]
sw4188A-ms98-a-0020 105.159375 106.309750 right
sw4188A-ms98-a-0021 106.309750 108.322375 [silence]
sw4188A-ms98-a-0022 108.322375 116.627750 well uh i[t]- it's interesting because this uh the town i live in is a a coastal town that uh
sw4188A-ms98-a-0023 116.627750 129.320125 [vocalized-noise] during the summer really is a uh a tourist resort type town and uh the population really drops off in the winter so they uh
sw4188A-ms98-a-0024 129.320125 132.541625 i guess they figure that they wouldn't uh
sw4188A-ms98-a-0025 132.541625 135.767750 they wouldn't provide that particular service
sw4188A-ms98-a-0026 135.767750 149.070750 uh when i when i lived back up uh closer to the city it we had the municipal trash pick up and we sorted the the bottles and the the paper and all of that and uh 
sw4188A-ms98-a-0027 149.070750 162.408625 you know i'd had about a year or so to get used to that whole system and i moved down and i said well this is a great idea you know i like doing this it's not that much of a pain um it sounds good to me 
sw4188A-ms98-a-0028 162.408625 168.847500 what do i do to keep doing this and the answer was you can if you want but it's going to cost you
sw4188A-ms98-a-0029 168.847500 171.347000 so i- i was fairly surprised
sw4188A-ms98-a-0030 171.347000 173.607875 [silence]
sw4188A-ms98-a-0031 173.607875 174.685250 yes
sw4188A-ms98-a-0032 174.685250 176.498125 [silence]
sw4188A-ms98-a-0033 176.498125 180.209000 well i really do like it here uh i
sw4188A-ms98-a-0034 180.209000 181.308000 [silence]
sw4188A-ms98-a-0035 181.308000 182.523250 um-hum
sw4188A-ms98-a-0036 182.523250 187.340500 [silence]
sw4188A-ms98-a-0037 187.340500 191.130125 right i'm a[bout]- i'm about uh maybe uh
sw4188A-ms98-a-0038 191.130125 194.572875 quarter of a mile to a half a mile away
sw4188A-ms98-a-0039 194.572875 195.929125 [silence]
sw4188A-ms98-a-0040 195.929125 206.711250 but uh the the other thing about recycling that had uh that i've noticed is i've seen a few articles in the paper now that uh
sw4188A-ms98-a-0041 206.711250 212.355375 there's more recycled material than people know what to do with
sw4188A-ms98-a-0042 212.355375 224.171750 uh apparently the uh manufacturers the uh glass people the plastics people the paper people aren't using enough of the recyclables 
sw4188A-ms98-a-0043 224.171750 225.654000 to uh
sw4188A-ms98-a-0044 225.654000 236.194875 to keep the chain going so there's a a back log of of material that was put in for recycling that no one knows what to do with and it's actually
sw4188A-ms98-a-0045 236.194875 238.595250 [silence]
sw4188A-ms98-a-0046 238.595250 245.401000 i don't know i i've seen it a couple of times and i'm i'm i couldn't cite the source [vocalized-noise] right now
sw4188A-ms98-a-0047 245.401000 250.291625 [silence]

sw4188A-ms98-a-0054 265.304875 279.080875 w[ell]- it's true we uh in this state don't have a bottle bill and every time it's raised there is uh that lobby that keeps it down and i it's
sw4188A-ms98-a-0055 279.080875 292.460250 i- i really can't see why people would get that upset about it because once it's in place it doesn't seem all that uh that difficult to manage
