sw4164A-ms98-a-0009 31.030500 39.854500 the uh it's kind of fun because i had picked the same topic uh last time i dialed in and uh you know which i didn't know it would do um
sw4164A-ms98-a-0010 39.854500 43.465625 you know one of the uh things they're trying to think of is ways
sw4164A-ms98-a-0011 43.465625 52.663250 you could create or maybe create is wrong but advocate a societal imperative that would have the same goal how could you make it uh
sw4164A-ms98-a-0012 52.663250 58.771625 more desired and respected in society for people to voluntarily uh engage in public service

sw4164A-ms98-a-0020 79.082250 85.333250 not sure how you would do that outside of a government sector though um and uh 
sw4164A-ms98-a-0021 85.333250 93.998750 you know i- i kind of hope against reality sadly that uh that government sector will get smaller with time but every indication is that it won't
sw4164A-ms98-a-0022 93.998750 96.314375 [laughter] you know uh

sw4164A-ms98-a-0025 118.187375 125.917750 [vocalized-noise] my uh my interpretation of history is is is that uh [noise] 
sw4164A-ms98-a-0026 125.917750 137.813875 when there's a real need there's usually no shortage of volunteers you know you look at what happened uh in California with the earthquake there were plenty of people volunteering you know you look at World War Two there were plenty of volunteers 
sw4164A-ms98-a-0027 137.813875 142.029625 uh you look at from the war in Vietnam all of a sudden there weren't a whole lot of volunteers
sw4164A-ms98-a-0028 142.029625 144.027125 and uh
sw4164A-ms98-a-0029 144.027125 152.568500 you know the question of when do you quote need unquoted on um say for example a draft uh maybe it should be the other way around maybe 
sw4164A-ms98-a-0030 152.568500 157.127375 the willingness of people to volunteer should be determining whether you need it or not
sw4164A-ms98-a-0031 157.127375 159.489375 [silence]
sw4164A-ms98-a-0032 159.489375 170.441125 yeah cause uh you know if all you got to do is uh print up a few million draft cards to start a war you know [laughter] you it may be a powerful in[centive]- you know what do you call it um
sw4164A-ms98-a-0033 170.441125 179.517875 [vocalized-noise] by volunteer may be a powerful incentive for keeping people out of uh you know keep keeping us out of may make it a little more difficult to get into war you know there are times you need to
sw4164A-ms98-a-0034 179.517875 182.416750 i don't perceive myself as a pacifist by any means
sw4164A-ms98-a-0035 182.416750 183.935625 but um
sw4164A-ms98-a-0036 183.935625 188.604375 you know there are probably there are places we've been over the years that perhaps we shouldn't have
sw4164A-ms98-a-0037 188.604375 196.462625 ah i don't think every time we uh wandered into some place it was honest just in itself i think we've screwed up a few times just like everybody else
