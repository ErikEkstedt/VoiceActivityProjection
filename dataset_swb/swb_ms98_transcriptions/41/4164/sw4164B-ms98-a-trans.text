sw4164B-ms98-a-0005 4.494875 12.487250 okay well i you know i think that uh i think it's fine to do that but i don't think it should be mandatory i'm not
sw4164B-ms98-a-0006 12.487250 16.014125 i'm not for having the equivalent of a draft
sw4164B-ms98-a-0007 16.014125 26.522125 [silence]
sw4164B-ms98-a-0008 26.522125 28.432500 that's right it's uh

sw4164B-ms98-a-0015 59.522375 69.191000 well i'd say as far as government jobs uh they could uh have some incentive for instance veterans get a preference when they're applying for a government job and i'd say people at
sw4164B-ms98-a-0016 69.191000 73.728375 had voluntarily served in such a thing as the Peace Corps or or something
sw4164B-ms98-a-0017 73.728375 75.407000 could also get that
sw4164B-ms98-a-0018 75.407000 82.478375 [silence]
sw4164B-ms98-a-0019 82.478375 84.218625 i don't know either
sw4164B-ms98-a-0020 84.218625 85.230250 [silence]
sw4164B-ms98-a-0021 85.230250 87.364750 and i'm not sure we'd we'd want it [vocalized-noise]

sw4164B-ms98-a-0024 93.326750 94.855750 right
sw4164B-ms98-a-0025 94.855750 96.850750 i feel the same way
sw4164B-ms98-a-0026 96.850750 104.351375 uh i think that uh i have nothing against the draft when you know when when the nation needs it
sw4164B-ms98-a-0027 104.351375 111.823625 uh but obviously when you don't need it you don't have a draft and i feel the same thing with universal service if there was a need for it
sw4164B-ms98-a-0028 111.823625 119.226250 then i'd say uh possibly i mean but it would to be an emergency type thing and i and i don't see that ever happening uh

sw4164B-ms98-a-0048 196.705375 200.349750 i think about on on public service too i think it has some
sw4164B-ms98-a-0049 200.349750 212.977500 some thought has to be given to what do we want these people to do in public service and and that would have a bearing on what training should they have because if you wanted to have people you know as an incentive you can have people go in after high school
sw4164B-ms98-a-0050 212.977500 227.449250 and then offer them assistance with their college and that way you'd be getting people who really didn't have any expertise in any particular but uh any particular field but they'd be willing hands so so to speak on public service projects

sw4164B-ms98-a-0057 243.276875 247.661000 are you familiar with the Civilian Conservation Corps back in the thirties
sw4164B-ms98-a-0058 247.661000 256.639375 okay well i mean it's before my time too but i- i read about it but you know in the height of the depression the government employed people to go work on public service projects
sw4164B-ms98-a-0059 256.639375 266.216500 that's right like WPA it was the same thing and there were many uh a lot of the national parks were built up by the Civilian Conservation Corps and a lot of WPA projects are still
sw4164B-ms98-a-0060 266.216500 268.353125 serving the the nation
sw4164B-ms98-a-0061 268.353125 275.185375 so uh someth[ing]- you know uh unskilled people could could do things like that as long as they had a positive attitude
