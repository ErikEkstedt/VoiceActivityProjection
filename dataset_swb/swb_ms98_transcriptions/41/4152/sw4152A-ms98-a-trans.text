sw4152A-ms98-a-0007 19.222125 24.871125 talking about the subject to[night]- tonight which is some i guess criminal courts the
sw4152A-ms98-a-0008 24.871125 31.997125 yeah the [vocalized-noise] the one of which was uh [vocalized-noise]
sw4152A-ms98-a-0009 31.997125 43.439750 something something that's been going on because of the Rodney King trial here in town and that is uh and that is the exclusion of jurors because of or in spite of their race
sw4152A-ms98-a-0010 43.439750 48.525625 uh ye[ah]- yeah well the the uh the the people that
sw4152A-ms98-a-0011 48.525625 58.547000 [vocalized-noise] the the the uh the jury that's trying uh the officers in that case is is an all white panel and there's been a lot made in the local papers of that fact
sw4152A-ms98-a-0012 58.547000 62.083000 [silence]
sw4152A-ms98-a-0013 62.083000 66.120000 they have they have they moved it up to the county north of here
sw4152A-ms98-a-0014 66.120000 78.029250 um it's in Ventura and there's there's still quite a bit of publicity obviously and it's kind of it's kind of debatable whether you could get a fair trial almost anywhere because that uh that
sw4152A-ms98-a-0015 78.029250 79.539750 [silence]
sw4152A-ms98-a-0016 79.539750 81.379500 yeah it was everywhere
sw4152A-ms98-a-0017 81.379500 90.091375 so you know and i- i think it would be very difficult to find someone uh find a panel that would be not have seen it and and known of what was going on
sw4152A-ms98-a-0018 90.091375 106.621000 [silence]
sw4152A-ms98-a-0019 106.621000 110.503625 exactly you know um the
sw4152A-ms98-a-0020 110.503625 120.181250 [noise] you know i i'm kind of torn on this issue it's like they're saying well on the one hand they're not he's not getting a jury of his peers which is in some ways i think true
sw4152A-ms98-a-0021 120.181250 128.958000 but on the other hand is it's also saying that white jurors are not going to are not going to convict
sw4152A-ms98-a-0022 128.958000 142.274500 uh you know they're not going to do their job which is the whole the whole point of being on a jury is to convict or or or uh let go based on whether or not the person whether or not the evidence says that there's enough
sw4152A-ms98-a-0023 142.274500 152.083875 [silence]
