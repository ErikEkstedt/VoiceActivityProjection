sw4124A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 2.470500 [noise] okay supposedly we're recording right now
sw4124A-ms98-a-0002 2.470500 16.022250 uh it's kind of interesting because_1 nearly thirty minutes ago i was reading an advertisement for the new Infinity i forget what model number it was but one of the features they were touting was a freon free air conditioning system
sw4124A-ms98-a-0003 16.022250 36.724500 [silence]
sw4124A-ms98-a-0004 36.724500 42.449375 yeah this is the first i'd seen of it too um actually i was kind of i'm su[rprised]- kind of surprised that that
sw4124A-ms98-a-0005 42.449375 52.400875 has become as much of an issue as it has because you know we know these things are designed to be closed systems either whether the problem's due to leaks or due to failures i would think that um
sw4124A-ms98-a-0006 52.400875 62.046250 yeah if it was designed with reasonable prudence stuff wouldn't get loose and um i mean you don't want it to it's not cheap and the thing fails when it does
sw4124A-ms98-a-0007 62.046250 66.232750 so i'm kind of surprised it became as much of an issue as it has
sw4124A-ms98-a-0008 66.232750 87.498500 [silence]
sw4124A-ms98-a-0009 87.498500 88.443750 um
sw4124A-ms98-a-0010 88.443750 93.770125 [silence]
sw4124A-ms98-a-0011 93.770125 95.179500 um-hum
sw4124A-ms98-a-0012 95.179500 97.009250 yeah
sw4124A-ms98-a-0013 97.009250 104.060750 so what what do you what do you see as the other biggies being in that realm you know what else could be something that is a bad thing
sw4124A-ms98-a-0014 104.060750 120.982000 [silence]
sw4124A-ms98-a-0015 120.982000 129.919750 yeah yeah i um traded cars recently and went from a car that got seventeen miles per gallon
sw4124A-ms98-a-0016 129.919750 135.268500 of worth of o[n]- on premium and didn't really wasn't happy with premium wasn't high enough
sw4124A-ms98-a-0017 135.268500 140.486750 to a car that gets about twenty four miles per gallon on uh the cheapest garbage you can put in it
sw4124A-ms98-a-0018 140.486750 149.408375 so i probably contributed my share there and um kind of interesting course um there is talk about legislation that would ban 
sw4124A-ms98-a-0019 149.408375 156.858625 the manufacture of an engine that required leaded fuel at some point and um
sw4124A-ms98-a-0020 156.858625 164.790625 this i believe has i read has put the general aviation uh world going nuts because
sw4124A-ms98-a-0021 164.790625 173.893625 a general aviation engine can cost in the neighborhood of thirteen to fourteen thousand dollars to overhaul and if it flies a hundred hours a year
sw4124A-ms98-a-0022 173.893625 182.166125 that's moderately high so the amount of dollars spent per unit of pollution saved
sw4124A-ms98-a-0023 182.166125 189.439250 um are very very tiny as compared to a car where it's a relatively inexpensive engine and it's running for a lot longer per year
sw4124A-ms98-a-0024 189.439250 195.859375 um so it's a question of um now apparently uh the EPA thought about this again and decided that
sw4124A-ms98-a-0025 195.859375 199.112000 these that that general aviation engines won't count
sw4124A-ms98-a-0026 199.112000 206.586625 and they'll allow them to continue to burn leaded fuels but there's some concern over if this is the only market is anybody gonna wanna bother making leaded fuels
sw4124A-ms98-a-0027 206.586625 238.029375 [silence]
sw4124A-ms98-a-0028 238.029375 241.766750 it's an old joke about the uh finest Congressman money can buy
sw4124A-ms98-a-0029 241.766750 244.502125 [silence]
sw4124A-ms98-a-0030 244.502125 247.553125 sounds like another issue um
sw4124A-ms98-a-0031 247.553125 256.045250 you know i've always viewed it as um the pollution issue as a property rights issue if um somebody dumped their garbage in your front lawn
sw4124A-ms98-a-0032 256.045250 258.311125 um regularly
sw4124A-ms98-a-0033 258.311125 263.521750 you'd have legal recourse but if he dumps it into the air surrounding your house you really don't have any
sw4124A-ms98-a-0034 263.521750 270.242875 and um i think therein lies a big part of the problem is that it's it's viewed a little differently from physical pollution
sw4124A-ms98-a-0035 270.242875 298.562000 [silence]
