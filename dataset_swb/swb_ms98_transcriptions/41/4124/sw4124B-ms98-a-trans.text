sw4124B-ms98-a-0005 16.578000 23.971250 that's interesting i hadn't seen that i know there was a lot of talk about freon contributing to the
sw4124B-ms98-a-0006 23.971250 30.161125 the uh hole in the ozone layer and other various pollution but uh other than
sw4124B-ms98-a-0007 30.161125 37.382000 uh making the air conditioning systems tighter i didn't know that there was any work on uh alternate coolants

sw4124B-ms98-a-0011 66.471625 73.105125 the uh the the times that i've seen any sort of of loss is uh
sw4124B-ms98-a-0012 73.105125 80.752250 at a time when maybe i'd have uh the the uh freon checked in the air conditioner or maybe topped off
sw4124B-ms98-a-0013 80.752250 92.704000 and it seemed to me that they'd practically waste almost as much as uh they'd put in the car but i've noticed in the past few years that uh the controls on that are
sw4124B-ms98-a-0014 92.704000 97.900750 tighter uh people are a lot more concerned about that
sw4124B-ms98-a-0015 97.900750 101.681000 [silence]
sw4124B-ms98-a-0016 101.681000 108.167000 well obviously cars uh and trucks contribute quite a bit
sw4124B-ms98-a-0017 108.167000 118.188000 and personally i'll uh i carpool uh most of the time with someone i work with but my schedule doesn't uh
sw4124B-ms98-a-0018 118.188000 122.429750 doesn't make for a consistent carpool

sw4124B-ms98-a-0026 208.027125 220.285750 that's a that's a good question uh the leaded fuels have obviously been out of the automotive industry for quite some time and there's always talk about uh
sw4124B-ms98-a-0027 220.285750 230.383500 [noise] about regulating the emissions that a a car engine can produce and tightening down on that and of course the uh
sw4124B-ms98-a-0028 230.383500 238.549250 the large auto makers in this country spend untold millions to lobby to keep business just the same as usual

sw4124B-ms98-a-0032 270.848750 284.496750 there's a big issue in Rhode Island right now uh there's a company that wants to build a coal fired uh energy plant very close to to downtown Providence
sw4124B-ms98-a-0033 284.496750 297.152250 and they are pulling all sorts of tricks to maneuver around various controls and inspections and regulations apparently the
