sw4144A-ms98-a-0017 64.378000 70.708875 well they went over it in the trial but they didn't give the stuff to the jury afterward it was really bizarre uh
sw4144A-ms98-a-0018 70.708875 75.543875 [silence]
sw4144A-ms98-a-0019 75.543875 89.463875 yeah but they have to ask for it and then the the bailiff brings it and they can look at it then the bailiff takes it away again it's not like they can just spread it out in their jury room and then you know get out a bunch of calculators and pocket computers and add it all up it was
sw4144A-ms98-a-0020 89.463875 93.964875 [silence]

sw4144A-ms98-a-0029 124.622250 128.355000 for sentencing i don't know does that make any sense i mean
sw4144A-ms98-a-0030 128.355000 135.872500 it depends on wh[at]- i- i don't know what the offense is i guess that's why we have juries is to take each case on a case by case basis and that's fine
sw4144A-ms98-a-0031 135.872500 138.224250 anyway um
sw4144A-ms98-a-0032 138.224250 165.729875 [silence]
sw4144A-ms98-a-0033 165.729875 170.318375 yeah or if it's an organizational problem you know where where you know the
sw4144A-ms98-a-0034 170.318375 176.626125 you know it's possible to imagine a corrupt judicial system where you know all the judges are are
sw4144A-ms98-a-0035 176.626125 180.255125 part of the system i guess that happened in Chicago once huh

sw4144A-ms98-a-0039 193.461250 199.900750 the only trouble with the jury system i see is it's really da[rned]- darned expensive and and you know time consuming and
sw4144A-ms98-a-0040 199.900750 203.581125 you know and and all these systems of where you can like
sw4144A-ms98-a-0041 203.581125 208.286000 ask a jury ask each juror what they think about something then kick them_1 out and
sw4144A-ms98-a-0042 208.286000 210.859500 you know i guess they can manipulate it a little
