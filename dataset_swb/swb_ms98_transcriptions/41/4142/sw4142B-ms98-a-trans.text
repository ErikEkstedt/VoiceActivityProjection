sw4142B-ms98-a-0002 0.531625 2.637875 [silence]
sw4142B-ms98-a-0003 2.637875 3.586750 [noise]
sw4142B-ms98-a-0004 3.586750 15.141250 yeah actu[ally]- actually uh mine's real straightforward um basically uh you know i take my standard deductions um on my house which i have a mortgage on
sw4142B-ms98-a-0005 15.141250 22.282500 and uh that's usually the big the big payoff part of the year for me because_1 i get a couple thousand dollars back usually
sw4142B-ms98-a-0006 22.282500 29.435250 but uh actually i uh i don't really begrudge uh the uh the government their due
sw4142B-ms98-a-0007 29.435250 37.899375 i d[o]- i do think that uh probably just like just almost anybody else that you know there's a lot of inefficiency in how they distribute taxes
sw4142B-ms98-a-0008 37.899375 45.807125 and i don't think that they uh they do a very good job of distributing them_1 to the people [laughter-who] really need them [laughter] but uh
sw4142B-ms98-a-0009 45.807125 51.982250 generally i think they're pretty necessary and life would probably be a lot worse if they didn't have taxation [laughter-so]
sw4142B-ms98-a-0010 51.982250 67.705125 [silence]
sw4142B-ms98-a-0011 67.705125 74.627750 yeah we actu[ally]- we actually had a situation here where uh our house was appraised you know every year by the county
sw4142B-ms98-a-0012 74.627750 78.872250 and we have to uh pay taxes on the basis of what that appraisal was
sw4142B-ms98-a-0013 78.872250 87.941500 and first year we owned the house um that appraisal was something like twenty five thousand dollars higher than we had just bought the house for [laughter]
sw4142B-ms98-a-0014 87.941500 97.841250 and so uh despite you know a lot of kibitzing by our neighbors and stuff i decided to go in to uh talk to the Board of Equalization
sw4142B-ms98-a-0015 97.841250 103.648000 uh in Prince William County and make sure that you know a mistake hadn't been made and all that kind of stuff 
sw4142B-ms98-a-0016 103.648000 113.098875 and so i just sort of made my case on the basis of um you know analogy to other to other houses around us that were similar in terms of
sw4142B-ms98-a-0017 113.098875 125.657375 square footage you know and size all and and you know general property size and things like that and ju[st]- just showed that you know our obvi[ous]- for some reason our property had been valued much higher
sw4142B-ms98-a-0018 125.657375 131.177500 and uh they bought it they actually reduced the uh reduced the a[ppraisal]-
sw4142B-ms98-a-0019 131.177500 132.402375 [silence]
sw4142B-ms98-a-0020 132.402375 140.632750 uh they didn't raise my neighbors' [laughter-yeah] they actually reduced mine to be in line with uh a more reasonable appraisal
sw4142B-ms98-a-0021 140.632750 149.276875 so i y[ou]- you know i I realized well the you know few instances you can fight city hall on things like property taxes but uh 
sw4142B-ms98-a-0022 149.276875 159.846375 yeah it was it was an interesting experience because the guy before me went in and he had a really kind of poorly organized discussion you know i mean he was sort of
sw4142B-ms98-a-0023 159.846375 168.004750 mad at the world and [laughter-uh] [laughter-he] he had sort of tha[t]- that mad at the world attitude right off the bat which you could you know see a mile away
sw4142B-ms98-a-0024 168.004750 180.000250 and then he uh then he started talking about all the things that were wrong with this property you know like you know the leaves hadn't been cleaned out in two years and the gutters are falling off and you know a lot of really minor stuff
sw4142B-ms98-a-0025 180.000250 184.721125 that just didn't impress these guys at all and they sort of gave him a hard time
sw4142B-ms98-a-0026 184.721125 195.251875 but uh you know when i pointed out that that our house was appraised at this and all these similar houses in the subdivision were appraised at you know twenty five thousand dollars less i mean
sw4142B-ms98-a-0027 195.251875 196.906875 [silence]
sw4142B-ms98-a-0028 196.906875 205.185500 yeah so it it it worked it was actually pretty uh pretty sa[tisfying]- satisfying [laughter] experience [laughter]
sw4142B-ms98-a-0029 205.185500 214.428750 but it wa[s]- it was kind of like going up to the Pope though you know i mean they they uh were sitting in these you know at these giant judges tables you know like 
sw4142B-ms98-a-0030 214.428750 215.943000 [silence]
sw4142B-ms98-a-0031 215.943000 219.878500 it was like a judge's chambers that that y[ou]- 
sw4142B-ms98-a-0032 219.878500 221.268750 [silence]
sw4142B-ms98-a-0033 221.268750 233.389000 it was the it was the county but it wasn't the council they have different people on this Board of Equalization i don't know i don't even know how they get on it you know i i'm just guessing they're appointed
sw4142B-ms98-a-0034 233.389000 242.812750 uh one of the guys is actually a kind of a well known realtor around here [laughter-so] you know i I figured if anybody gave me a hard time it'd be him [laughter-you]
sw4142B-ms98-a-0035 242.812750 244.335250 [noise]
sw4142B-ms98-a-0036 244.335250 245.551625 [silence]
sw4142B-ms98-a-0037 245.551625 246.755875 yeah
sw4142B-ms98-a-0038 246.755875 248.223125 [silence]
sw4142B-ms98-a-0039 248.223125 260.748000 but other than that uh i haven't had too much too much problem with taxes actually when i was in grad school i lived in Virginia also i went to school down at uh Charlottesville and uh
sw4142B-ms98-a-0040 260.748000 264.500250 uh i had a you know one of these graduate fellowships
sw4142B-ms98-a-0041 264.500250 269.128500 and fortunately it was not taxable at that time
sw4142B-ms98-a-0042 269.128500 272.202375 bu[t]- they actua[lly]- they actually hassled me over it though
sw4142B-ms98-a-0043 272.202375 283.031875 and i had to i had to go to some length you know i actually got one of these letters that that said you know you got to show up at the local you know IRS office and explain
sw4142B-ms98-a-0044 283.031875 286.825750 yeah and actually explain you know what was going on and
sw4142B-ms98-a-0045 286.825750 297.255000 you know [laughter] i just i said hey i mean it's tax free i mean that's my understanding of things so anyway eventually they they accepted that that it was but actually w[ork]- i work with a guy now who's
sw4142B-ms98-a-0046 297.255000 298.850000 i I i guess he was righ[t]-
