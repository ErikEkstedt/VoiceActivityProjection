sw4147B-ms98-a-0003 6.748625 18.117875 well we call it the S P C A it's the uh an[imal]- from an animal shelter uh he'd come in there as a stray uh he's a Pomeranian and Sheltie cross uh
sw4147B-ms98-a-0004 18.117875 24.022125 well he was very well trained when we got him uh he's
sw4147B-ms98-a-0005 24.022125 32.732250 no uh we suspect that he was hurt in an accident you know got away from somebody traveling through and hurt in an accident because [noise]
sw4147B-ms98-a-0006 32.732250 40.039625 a dog that looks as good as he does and is trained as well is someone that has lost him and not have been able to locate him
sw4147B-ms98-a-0007 40.039625 44.479250 and uh if they were local people they would have been able to find him
sw4147B-ms98-a-0008 44.479250 52.154500 [silence]
sw4147B-ms98-a-0009 52.154500 53.439500 uh-huh

sw4147B-ms98-a-0014 71.653250 72.747500 [silence]
sw4147B-ms98-a-0015 72.747500 73.985250 uh-huh
sw4147B-ms98-a-0016 73.985250 92.719500 [silence]
sw4147B-ms98-a-0017 92.719500 94.772250 [noise] oh i think so
sw4147B-ms98-a-0018 94.772250 104.137500 [silence]
sw4147B-ms98-a-0019 104.137500 105.577250 uh-huh
sw4147B-ms98-a-0020 105.577250 112.506625 [silence]
sw4147B-ms98-a-0021 112.506625 113.815000 yeah
sw4147B-ms98-a-0022 113.815000 117.122875 [silence]
sw4147B-ms98-a-0023 117.122875 123.905500 well i- i guess in one sense we felt that it it's nice to have a dog
sw4147B-ms98-a-0024 123.905500 134.376125 even though there are you know complications come with it and then with our children uh at the time they were oh grade five and and grade eight so
sw4147B-ms98-a-0025 134.376125 143.749125 it was an age where it was uh we thought it would be good for them to have the discipline that goes with with having a pet uh
sw4147B-ms98-a-0026 143.749125 145.728875 [silence]
sw4147B-ms98-a-0027 145.728875 146.872125 yeah
sw4147B-ms98-a-0028 146.872125 147.888875 right
sw4147B-ms98-a-0029 147.888875 148.432500 [noise]
sw4147B-ms98-a-0030 148.432500 154.932125 uh well that's the idea i think the reality of it is that they perhaps uh
sw4147B-ms98-a-0031 154.932125 158.913625 it depends on the on everyone's discipline
sw4147B-ms98-a-0032 158.913625 169.702500 and uh from that aspect i'm short on the discipline because i don't uh enforce that the kids look after the dog and uh we've had him about four years now 
sw4147B-ms98-a-0033 169.702500 170.974500 [noise] uh
sw4147B-ms98-a-0034 170.974500 180.735500 [noise] but i think it does it it you know it's necessary that individuals have the discipline to look after the animal properly uh
sw4147B-ms98-a-0035 180.735500 181.948250 yeah
sw4147B-ms98-a-0036 181.948250 186.130625 [silence]
sw4147B-ms98-a-0037 186.130625 194.465625 uh actually no we live in a in an area that's oh probably about two and a half miles from the university
sw4147B-ms98-a-0038 194.465625 200.464375 uh we live right might say we live right in uh in the middle of a residential area
sw4147B-ms98-a-0039 200.464375 202.508500 and uh
sw4147B-ms98-a-0040 202.508500 212.700250 [noise] so that is not as good uh [noise] you know this dog being a small dog it's uh more you more acceptable but again
sw4147B-ms98-a-0041 212.700250 216.607625 [silence]
sw4147B-ms98-a-0042 216.607625 217.818625 yeah

sw4147B-ms98-a-0046 250.533750 255.549375 [noise] yeah it's uh that's one of the biggest concerns it's like
sw4147B-ms98-a-0047 255.549375 260.820625 uh there's a lot to be gained from a relationship with an animal but the same time
sw4147B-ms98-a-0048 260.820625 267.250000 one has to recognize the reality of physical requirements of of the animal
sw4147B-ms98-a-0049 267.250000 270.613250 and the larger they are the more room they need to exercise
sw4147B-ms98-a-0050 270.613250 272.487000 [silence]
