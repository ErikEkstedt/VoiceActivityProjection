sw4147A-ms98-a-0018 70.776125 79.857625 kind of looks like a Dal[matian]- a Dalmatian and we trained it from a pup and basically it right now it it's fully trained and it can do
sw4147A-ms98-a-0019 79.857625 85.714250 a lot of things it will get beer for you out of the fridge and it will get the newspaper and do all kinds of stuff
sw4147A-ms98-a-0020 85.714250 93.298125 so it's really [noise] it's it's kind of a show piece [laughter-anymore] and whenever anybody comes over we always have to show him Domino [laughter-you] [laughter-know]
sw4147A-ms98-a-0021 93.298125 94.381625 [silence]

sw4147A-ms98-a-0030 141.988250 149.903750 sure sure learn a bit learn a little bit of discipline and how to care for it and things like that that's good that kind of builds some character a little bit
sw4147A-ms98-a-0031 149.903750 158.661250 [silence]
sw4147A-ms98-a-0032 158.661250 160.032875 um-hum

sw4147A-ms98-a-0036 178.906250 181.640500 yeah that's something that's important for sure
sw4147A-ms98-a-0037 181.640500 188.133000 i think uh do you live in a in a in a fairly rural part of the uh [vocalized-noise] or
sw4147A-ms98-a-0038 188.133000 193.928875 [silence]
sw4147A-ms98-a-0039 193.928875 195.465000 oh i see

sw4147A-ms98-a-0044 208.443875 211.233625 [silence]
sw4147A-ms98-a-0045 211.233625 217.269250 yeah it's not that big of a problem With Domino she was full grown i would estimate seventy pounds
sw4147A-ms98-a-0046 217.269250 223.808625 and you know w[e]- we lived in Oviedo which is a small town it's a suburb of Orlando
sw4147A-ms98-a-0047 223.808625 229.736000 but [noise] there's not there wasn't a lot of room for her to run around and she was a dog that loved to run
sw4147A-ms98-a-0048 229.736000 242.700250 so that was the biggest problem i saw and i think that's one of the uh the issues people need to think about before they get a dog is you know do you have the room for this dog to run around or c[an]- you know i guess you can't really say for cats
sw4147A-ms98-a-0049 242.700250 251.382500 me and cats don't get along too well uh [laughter] but you know that whole space issue i think is real important
sw4147A-ms98-a-0050 251.382500 265.939500 [silence]
sw4147A-ms98-a-0051 265.939500 268.712625 right yeah that that
sw4147A-ms98-a-0052 268.712625 269.717375 [silence]
sw4147A-ms98-a-0053 269.717375 278.620125 sure and that's all part of y[our]- of keeping your part of the relationship you know showing the maturity and responsibility to recognize those uh those issues
sw4147A-ms98-a-0054 278.620125 287.914750 you know and also the whole the whole thing with noise my mother oh she freaks out because she's got neighbors that have dogs that don't train them
sw4147A-ms98-a-0055 287.914750 299.170000 and you know we h[ad]- we had a neighbor in Nebraska when we lived there that had uh Brittany Spaniels and they're very high strung animals to begin with but uh
