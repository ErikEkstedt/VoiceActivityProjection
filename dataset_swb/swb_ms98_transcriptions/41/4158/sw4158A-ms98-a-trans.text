sw4158A-ms98-a-0025 90.080875 94.686250 [silence]
sw4158A-ms98-a-0026 94.686250 103.691875 uh they do that i think if you're uh research title staff here then i know of some of the people that have gotten their masters and i think that
sw4158A-ms98-a-0027 103.691875 117.030625 um they might you know pay for that pay for the classes and stuff but i know they let you they'll let you decrease how many hours you work by any kind of percentage you know they'll let you work halftime if you want to if you wanna finish you wanna
sw4158A-ms98-a-0028 117.030625 128.941000 yeah if they'll let you work decrease your number of hours by any percentage just just about so if if you wanna get your masters and then i think of course you get like a with your extra degrees you get a pay raise due so
sw4158A-ms98-a-0029 128.941000 131.248125 that'll probably help out but
sw4158A-ms98-a-0030 131.248125 141.780375 [silence]
sw4158A-ms98-a-0031 141.780375 144.447875 do you get any kind of health care type stuff

sw4158A-ms98-a-0037 157.348875 160.848000 yeah i think i mean that's pretty i[mportant]- that's a pretty important uh
sw4158A-ms98-a-0038 160.848000 166.767500 part of it there because_1 that that can be really expensive if you ever have any health problems my dad i think my i'm still covered on
sw4158A-ms98-a-0039 166.767500 170.685625 with my dad's uh health plan at his where he works but
sw4158A-ms98-a-0040 170.685625 174.163625 it definitely be something to look into i guess once i get my own 
sw4158A-ms98-a-0041 174.163625 186.960125 [silence]
sw4158A-ms98-a-0042 186.960125 188.277625 uh-huh

sw4158A-ms98-a-0046 199.040125 205.809500 the only i think the i guess the only real um benefit i guess you could say working for me working here besides i mean
sw4158A-ms98-a-0047 205.809500 209.326875 i'm learning and stuff because i'm at you know in school but
sw4158A-ms98-a-0048 209.326875 212.133625 there's there's some weird law where um
sw4158A-ms98-a-0049 212.133625 217.320375 um student employees working for the government don't have to pay Social Security tax
sw4158A-ms98-a-0050 217.320375 218.683875 though
sw4158A-ms98-a-0051 218.683875 222.350875 that's about five percent right there so
sw4158A-ms98-a-0052 222.350875 224.993000 that's about the only real bonus
sw4158A-ms98-a-0053 224.993000 232.327000 i have so i have to take that into consideration when i evaluate like how much i get paid rela[tive]- you know because_1 if i was working somewhere else i'd have to
sw4158A-ms98-a-0054 232.327000 235.222500 you know pay an extra five percent or so
sw4158A-ms98-a-0055 235.222500 245.008750 [silence]
sw4158A-ms98-a-0056 245.008750 246.220000 hm
