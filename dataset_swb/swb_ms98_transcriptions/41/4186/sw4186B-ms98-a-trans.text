sw4186B-ms98-a-0033 101.770500 103.341375 i've had uh
sw4186B-ms98-a-0034 103.341375 108.840125 and the Siberian was basically there for the taking if i wanted it as a puppy
sw4186B-ms98-a-0035 108.840125 113.299625 so i brought the Siberian home and she's just been just great with kids
sw4186B-ms98-a-0036 113.299625 114.821000 a[nd]-
sw4186B-ms98-a-0037 114.821000 119.309375 and then my wife wanted a had a cocker when she was younger and
sw4186B-ms98-a-0038 119.309375 125.180500 when she was a kid and she wanted to have a another spaniel type dog
sw4186B-ms98-a-0039 125.180500 126.594125 and
sw4186B-ms98-a-0040 126.594125 134.010750 so we wanted a bigger spaniel because_1 we didn't want a cock[er]- as small as a cocker for the husky to beat up
sw4186B-ms98-a-0041 134.010750 136.552625 but the what
sw4186B-ms98-a-0042 136.552625 138.183375 tooth and nail

sw4186B-ms98-a-0048 149.448000 150.865125 yeah right
sw4186B-ms98-a-0049 150.865125 162.273875 dogs don't normally fight serious very long because_1 normally one as big as a Siberian or as small as a spaniel the spaniel knows its place pretty quickly and that takes care of that
sw4186B-ms98-a-0050 162.273875 163.749625 [silence]
sw4186B-ms98-a-0051 163.749625 169.731625 you know it's normally they're at each other just you know snarling and snapping and rolling and thumbing
sw4186B-ms98-a-0052 169.731625 179.410125 and then when they're but when the Siberian's decided that she she's had all that she wants of that hyper spaniel it's it's very clearly stated
sw4186B-ms98-a-0053 179.410125 180.855250 [silence]
sw4186B-ms98-a-0054 180.855250 188.186375 you know there are very clear words spoken in dog and that's the end and the span[iel]- and the and the springer goes [laughter-away]
