sw4197B-ms98-a-0005 24.472875 31.744375 yeah i- i agree i don't think it's uh effectively used um as far as the amount um
sw4197B-ms98-a-0006 31.744375 35.235375 i'm never really sure about the amount because there's so much that
sw4197B-ms98-a-0007 35.235375 44.495500 needs to happen in this country that isn't happening and that not that the government necessarily should be the agent through which it's accomplished but
sw4197B-ms98-a-0008 44.495500 54.463500 there's a lot of things that are crying out for somebody to do something with and the last fifty years everybody looked to the government for that sort of thing primarily
sw4197B-ms98-a-0009 54.463500 59.256500 and uh i- i agree with you that things are just not used effectively
sw4197B-ms98-a-0010 59.256500 69.482000 and we you know people don't want to live within their means we've got huge deficits that doesn't appear to you know nobody's talking about the deficit at all on the current campaigns at all

sw4197B-ms98-a-0039 181.495125 195.497875 right if if yeah it sounds sounds very good and i but i wonder about_1 states like Mississippi and Louisiana that always tend to have and Ar[kansas]- and Arkansas significantly with Clinton running but it
sw4197B-ms98-a-0040 195.497875 207.485250 states that always seem to have really poor educational systems um and just generally a very very poor economy i mean Louisiana was picking up for a while with the energy boom in the seventies but
sw4197B-ms98-a-0041 207.485250 211.479875 still their economy never really got off the ground and
sw4197B-ms98-a-0042 211.479875 223.488625 you know it it i don't know i don't live in Louisiana or any of those states and i don't ever think that i will but so it's really none of my business but it's like something you know i- i it's
sw4197B-ms98-a-0043 223.488625 236.033375 i don't know it seems like somehow not enough is being done to educate people there and things like that to to be able to participate with yeah the rest of us in the in the world it's just pre elitist but
sw4197B-ms98-a-0044 236.033375 239.745625 you know the the rest of us in the country at least
sw4197B-ms98-a-0045 239.745625 250.990750 and then i yeah i know there's plenty of people in California here who don't have enough education either i mean you know that's always the a major political football problem in any state the education system

sw4197B-ms98-a-0053 265.191875 274.403125 yeah well i don't think it really matters anyway because_1 it you know they'll what they want is natural conversations and i think the topic just to kind of give us a boost in that direction
sw4197B-ms98-a-0054 274.403125 282.465750 but getting back to taxes um currently i think the the current system we got isn't really
sw4197B-ms98-a-0055 282.465750 288.726250 it it isn't taxing the rich enough essentially um it i think that
sw4197B-ms98-a-0056 288.726250 299.682000 [vocalized-noise] people people don't have an idea that the whole we're all in this together and in the eighties that wasn't the common theme the common theme was you know get rich quick for a lot of
