sw4197A-ms98-a-0002 0.487250 11.997500 all right um [laughter] well basically i think we uh probably pay more out in taxes than we should uh we don't see the sort of feedback that we need from it
sw4197A-ms98-a-0003 11.997500 24.491500 um i think the government waste a lot of the money um and spends it on purposes that that the government really shouldn't be spending it on um i don't think that it's effectively used
sw4197A-ms98-a-0004 24.491500 25.989750 so
sw4197A-ms98-a-0005 25.989750 52.488250 [silence]

sw4197A-ms98-a-0008 58.442500 61.474375 yeah i think i think 
sw4197A-ms98-a-0009 61.474375 62.753125 [silence]
sw4197A-ms98-a-0010 62.753125 64.491875 um-hum

sw4197A-ms98-a-0017 81.497250 92.997500 exactly exactly i mean it they keep on thinking that you know it's okay to borrow against the future indefinitely um and they don't realize that once they create these programs
sw4197A-ms98-a-0018 92.997500 101.430375 y[ou]- well they have such a hard time killing off a program yeah once once it starts receiving funding it its like uh yanking wisdom teeth to try and get it uh 
sw4197A-ms98-a-0019 101.430375 101.964875 [laughter]
sw4197A-ms98-a-0020 101.964875 110.495875 killed you know even when and you know i don't know a lot of the things i think the federal government does uh it does very poorly um
sw4197A-ms98-a-0021 110.495875 121.795375 i'm kind of a state's right person and i think that a lot of of what the federal government could do could be handled uh more efficiently uh on a state level
sw4197A-ms98-a-0022 121.795375 130.488625 uh you know state to state because the states i think have a better idea of where where they need to spend the money for the kind of population that they have um
sw4197A-ms98-a-0023 130.488625 135.999250 and i think the federal government is just too far removed from the the specific situation
sw4197A-ms98-a-0024 135.999250 148.684750 um you know i mean there there are some things that our taxes need to be spent on um at a federal level like national uh defense and uh you know common rule making and things like that um 
sw4197A-ms98-a-0025 148.684750 158.003125 but i think a lot of it could be handed over to the states you know especially things like welfare and and you know food stamps that kind of programs um so
sw4197A-ms98-a-0026 158.003125 160.461625 [silence]
sw4197A-ms98-a-0027 160.461625 173.974250 um yes and no um a lot of it you know the states get like matching funds or you know they they get a certain amount of funds that they get to do with as they please but um
sw4197A-ms98-a-0028 173.974250 182.479750 why you know why doesn't the state take in the revenue directly then you know uh kind of eliminating some of those bureaucracy that goes on
