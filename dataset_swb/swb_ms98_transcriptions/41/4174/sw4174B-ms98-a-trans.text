sw4174B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.941000 [noise]
sw4174B-ms98-a-0002 0.941000 11.663375 okay well Mark our situation is that we do have a daughter that is uh in the situation of choosing college she's actually at Bible College for this current year
sw4174B-ms98-a-0003 11.663375 13.472625 and uh
sw4174B-ms98-a-0004 13.472625 14.944875 [silence]
sw4174B-ms98-a-0005 14.944875 22.194375 i guess uh first and foremost it really it's a question of
sw4174B-ms98-a-0006 22.194375 23.506375 what
sw4174B-ms98-a-0007 23.506375 29.309625 the student wants to have in the way of a career and then uh
sw4174B-ms98-a-0008 29.309625 34.683875 uh which colleges or universities can best offer that program
sw4174B-ms98-a-0009 34.683875 46.921375 and then it comes down to the dollar you have to uh it's whether or not you're a resident for that jurisdiction or you know it does it comes down to uh trying to come with a trade off of the costs
sw4174B-ms98-a-0010 46.921375 50.386375 uh what do you feel about some of the things that need to
sw4174B-ms98-a-0011 50.386375 86.773875 [silence]
sw4174B-ms98-a-0012 86.773875 100.023250 no y[ou]- the the college uh their the catalogs are sales material it doesn't matter whether [noise] you know they're they're selling school and uh and true it uh really is helpful if a
sw4174B-ms98-a-0013 100.023250 103.156000 parent and the student can get there and see
sw4174B-ms98-a-0014 103.156000 109.319625 the real character of the school and the real life experiences of the school
sw4174B-ms98-a-0015 109.319625 113.469500 uh i guess there's a difference in here th[e]- the
sw4174B-ms98-a-0016 113.469500 122.906000 [noise] at least the university here in Saskatoon is primarily uh off campus resident students like they just live in the community
sw4174B-ms98-a-0017 122.906000 124.014250 uh
sw4174B-ms98-a-0018 124.014250 130.510500 you know i know that there are a lot of colleges and universities particularly as they get to be a little bit on the
sw4174B-ms98-a-0019 130.510500 141.402125 smaller side where dormitory life is uh is right on campus as well and that you know that changes the character of it quite a bit
sw4174B-ms98-a-0020 141.402125 145.967125 [silence]
sw4174B-ms98-a-0021 145.967125 147.170750 um-hum
sw4174B-ms98-a-0022 147.170750 162.014875 [silence]
sw4174B-ms98-a-0023 162.014875 172.025750 yeah uh i guess we're here this is the university that has for years had the the car that uh will travel the farthest on uh
sw4174B-ms98-a-0024 172.025750 175.521000 on a small quantity of gas our engineering students
sw4174B-ms98-a-0025 175.521000 183.860125 uh in competitions and that's the kind of thing that also you see uh if you can see the kinds of
sw4174B-ms98-a-0026 183.860125 184.970500 [silence]
sw4174B-ms98-a-0027 184.970500 198.840250 achievements that have been made by students as well as graduates can give you an idea of the character of the school uh whether you you know in one sense whether you've got a spirit of innovation and excellence or whether you've got a
sw4174B-ms98-a-0028 198.840250 201.124250 a spirit of
sw4174B-ms98-a-0029 201.124250 207.697500 somewhat unkind but producing graduates um you know as sort of
sw4174B-ms98-a-0030 207.697500 215.945125 some development and some training uh like it's easy enough to crank out graduates but to really challenge them
sw4174B-ms98-a-0031 215.945125 220.801125 and uh and that can vary between colleges and faculties even
sw4174B-ms98-a-0032 220.801125 224.773625 as to how you know what the attitude
sw4174B-ms98-a-0033 224.773625 226.828875 towards achievement is
sw4174B-ms98-a-0034 226.828875 227.847250 [silence]
sw4174B-ms98-a-0035 227.847250 229.066000 uh
sw4174B-ms98-a-0036 229.066000 230.120250 [silence]
sw4174B-ms98-a-0037 230.120250 231.870625 do you uh
sw4174B-ms98-a-0038 231.870625 235.454250 have anyone that you're seriously needing to uh
sw4174B-ms98-a-0039 235.454250 241.702625 feed information to i suppose if you're actually a[t]- at Georgia Tech as a student you're a ways away from that
sw4174B-ms98-a-0040 241.702625 252.416500 [silence]
sw4174B-ms98-a-0041 252.416500 253.948875 [laughter]
sw4174B-ms98-a-0042 253.948875 263.486000 [silence]
sw4174B-ms98-a-0043 263.486000 264.845375 right
sw4174B-ms98-a-0044 264.845375 271.229375 well that's that's one of the really a valid point that people need to consider as well
sw4174B-ms98-a-0045 271.229375 277.544750 uh you know to going to college university is going to take four to eight years depending on
sw4174B-ms98-a-0046 277.544750 285.520625 the pro[grams]- pro[grams]- programs person's involved in and after that you have to be out in the real world and have to be able to support yourself
sw4174B-ms98-a-0047 285.520625 291.785750 and if you go in an area that there is just not much of a job market [noise] jeez the best
sw4174B-ms98-a-0048 291.785750 296.828125 right best training in the world is not going to f[eed]- put food on your table
sw4174B-ms98-a-0049 296.828125 298.530000 and uh
