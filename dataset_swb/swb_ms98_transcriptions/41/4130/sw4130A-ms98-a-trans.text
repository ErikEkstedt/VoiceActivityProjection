sw4130A-ms98-a-0002 2.499625 5.535625 [silence]
sw4130A-ms98-a-0003 5.535625 11.587875 i'd agree too but i mean it seems like it just makes economic sense in that you know
sw4130A-ms98-a-0004 11.587875 17.855375 um you know it would have made even better economic sense to to to have had a lot more research done a lo[nger]- lo[nger]- longer ago
sw4130A-ms98-a-0005 17.855375 19.084500 you know because
sw4130A-ms98-a-0006 19.084500 24.035500 you know because um the country's gonna wind up paying for the treatment of patients
sw4130A-ms98-a-0007 24.035500 25.481875 um-hum
sw4130A-ms98-a-0008 25.481875 33.075000 [silence]
sw4130A-ms98-a-0009 33.075000 42.847000 i think they cover AIDS but what they do is um if you know you apply for for to get a a insurance policy they'll um check to see if you're HIV positive
sw4130A-ms98-a-0010 42.847000 54.282125 and if you are not only will they not give you um a policy but they'll um they have like there's like you know a database of people that have tested positive so you'll never be able to get insurance ever again

sw4130A-ms98-a-0015 69.690375 77.278625 you know becau[se]- because of of the audi[ence]- you know because because the majority of the high risk groups were in people that no one really cared about
