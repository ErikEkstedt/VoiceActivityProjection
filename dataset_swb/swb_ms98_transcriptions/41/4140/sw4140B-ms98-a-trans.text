sw4140B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 38.513625 [noise]
sw4140B-ms98-a-0002 38.513625 47.695750 well i pretty much agree with you uh i wouldn't say that i'm a ten because i do think that there are some types of weapons that
sw4140B-ms98-a-0003 47.695750 57.795750 should be restricted because of their extreme potential to uh [noise] uh to produce collateral damage if you know what i mean
sw4140B-ms98-a-0004 57.795750 67.148250 i don't think that people should have nuclear weapons in their homes or or biological weapons but i'm probably uh on a scale of ten i'm a i'm a nine
sw4140B-ms98-a-0005 67.148250 73.374750 in that i think that any any arm that can easily be carried by hand
sw4140B-ms98-a-0006 73.374750 86.601875 should certainly be uh protected for individuals to own and uh to use uh in particular i'll express my opinion on this uh this there's there's some people that think that
sw4140B-ms98-a-0007 86.601875 95.765375 the second amendment is you know only a collective right that it applies to the militia i don't believe that i think it it applies to individuals
sw4140B-ms98-a-0008 95.765375 107.975625 uh also uh i don't think that the our founding fathers had anything in mind anything to do with hunting or even defense against criminals or
sw4140B-ms98-a-0009 107.975625 118.734250 or target shooting what they had in mind was that people need to be armed in order to protect themselves from the government becoming too strong and taking away our liberties
sw4140B-ms98-a-0010 118.734250 142.397875 [silence]
sw4140B-ms98-a-0011 142.397875 154.213375 well the thing [vocalized-noise] with the police is that they're only good to pick up the pieces after the crime has happened we have to to take precautions to defend ourselves 
sw4140B-ms98-a-0012 154.213375 164.799375 uh if someone comes after you with a gun there's no way that the police are going to stop them uh even if you have an opportunity to call the police uh because someone has threatened you 
sw4140B-ms98-a-0013 164.799375 171.257875 they won't come out and protect you all they can do is investigate a crime after it's been committed it's very rare that they prevent one
sw4140B-ms98-a-0014 171.257875 179.448750 so it's important that we each as individuals have the means to protect ourselves and in this day and age that means having guns
sw4140B-ms98-a-0015 179.448750 208.347875 [silence]
sw4140B-ms98-a-0016 208.347875 221.571375 i- i agree with you i think that uh [noise] although to to a large degree what the the politicians are doing is just responding or reflecting
sw4140B-ms98-a-0017 221.571375 233.448125 what the electorate seems to be telling them the problem is of course is that the majority of the people in this country have no idea what the right to keep and bear arms means or what it's for
sw4140B-ms98-a-0018 233.448125 242.780125 and all they see is rampant crime in the streets and they think that banning guns is going to stop that but that's that's simply not the case uh
sw4140B-ms98-a-0019 242.780125 252.118875 you take away the guns uh from law-abiding people and uh i mean it it seems like a trite phrase but
sw4140B-ms98-a-0020 252.118875 265.312500 i[f]- if guns are outlawed only outlaws will have guns they're not going to stop the drug dealers and the criminals from from getting uh guns of any sort and what they really need to do is attack the root causes of of crime
sw4140B-ms98-a-0021 265.312500 299.458000 [silence]
