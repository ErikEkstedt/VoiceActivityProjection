sw4140A-ms98-a-0002 1.382375 8.160125 from this from the scale of one to ten i- i lean more towards no restriction 
sw4140A-ms98-a-0003 8.160125 14.834500 we by the constitution we have the the right to bear arms and
sw4140A-ms98-a-0004 14.834500 21.829375 i believe our freedoms are being constantly eroded all the time and
sw4140A-ms98-a-0005 21.829375 28.656250 President Bush just signed a law that that banned
sw4140A-ms98-a-0006 28.656250 34.568625 lot of automatic weapons and and such where they wouldn't do any more damage than 
sw4140A-ms98-a-0007 34.568625 39.002250 some Winchester rifles or things like that what do you think about that
sw4140A-ms98-a-0008 39.002250 118.477375 [silence]

sw4140A-ms98-a-0010 130.797750 142.399375 and the main the main purpose say for the police is to keep the have nots from taking from the haves and that is the purposes o[f]- of the gun control
sw4140A-ms98-a-0011 142.399375 179.415125 [silence]
sw4140A-ms98-a-0012 179.415125 192.498625 oh i- i- i agree i my point was that the police want to get rid rid of the people of of guns and what's happening is that i see i- i- i view this country as as as we have
sw4140A-ms98-a-0013 192.498625 199.811875 peoples and societies and cultures and things that are be o[ppressed]- that are oppressed and so that to
sw4140A-ms98-a-0014 199.811875 209.276500 to take the way the those weapons so they can protect themselves is that's what the means and that's what they're they're trying to do and by enacting all this legislation 
sw4140A-ms98-a-0015 209.276500 254.505375 [silence]

sw4140A-ms98-a-0019 272.856125 286.696250 they haven't been except for the immigrants have come to this country they're not cognizant of war and and chaos and terrorism like Lebanon or countries that have been invaded
sw4140A-ms98-a-0020 286.696250 299.458000 and if our country needs if our country's invaded we need the people to to rise i mean the the military and the police isn't going to do it all for us and i[f]- and if we don't have the the g[overment]-
