sw4131A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.838375 [noise] personally
sw4131A-ms98-a-0002 0.838375 9.120000 prefer sports cars and responsive cars i like to uh to drive kind of fast i guess but i'm finding that as i get older
sw4131A-ms98-a-0003 9.120000 18.548750 i'm thinking that it would also be nice to have kind of a a nicer bigger maybe more luxu[rious]- luxurious car to have in addition to the one i already have
sw4131A-ms98-a-0004 18.548750 20.255500 [silence]
sw4131A-ms98-a-0005 20.255500 31.974625 it's a uh Dodge Daytona it's a Shelby Z they only made them for for one year it's really just a variation on the other Daytonas that they have out but i'm real happy with it
sw4131A-ms98-a-0006 31.974625 40.889125 it's uh an eighty seven and it's the first turbo charge car i ever owned and i was a little little reluctant about that because i heard things about
sw4131A-ms98-a-0007 40.889125 50.764750 uh other people that owned turbo charge cars that the turbo would break quite often be very expensive to fix but i haven't had any problems with it
sw4131A-ms98-a-0008 50.764750 58.957625 [silence]
sw4131A-ms98-a-0009 58.957625 60.331000 oh really
sw4131A-ms98-a-0010 60.331000 63.845125 [silence]
sw4131A-ms98-a-0011 63.845125 64.882625 uh
sw4131A-ms98-a-0012 64.882625 66.193250 [silence]
sw4131A-ms98-a-0013 66.193250 69.582375 uh-huh how old is uh how old is the truck
sw4131A-ms98-a-0014 69.582375 72.823750 [silence]
sw4131A-ms98-a-0015 72.823750 73.941625 uh-huh
sw4131A-ms98-a-0016 73.941625 86.232000 [silence]
sw4131A-ms98-a-0017 86.232000 87.582375 um-hum
sw4131A-ms98-a-0018 87.582375 95.888000 [silence]
sw4131A-ms98-a-0019 95.888000 97.247125 uh-huh
sw4131A-ms98-a-0020 97.247125 102.706125 [silence]
sw4131A-ms98-a-0021 102.706125 104.044375 oh
sw4131A-ms98-a-0022 104.044375 108.086875 [silence]
sw4131A-ms98-a-0023 108.086875 114.114375 oh sure yeah we just recently bought a second car and we ended up getting a Jeep Wrangler
sw4131A-ms98-a-0024 114.114375 120.588125 and uh it's funny though because it's this is actually my wife's car the Jeep and uh
sw4131A-ms98-a-0025 120.588125 127.911125 but it's fun having four wheel drive capability and a rugged suspension like that to go out and do things
sw4131A-ms98-a-0026 127.911125 132.017750 but we're still finding that when we end up driving other people places that
sw4131A-ms98-a-0027 132.017750 139.139500 it would be nice to have something where something roomier where people didn't have to duck their heads or scrunch their knees up and
sw4131A-ms98-a-0028 139.139500 144.340500 something that would ride a little more smoothly especially when when you travel
sw4131A-ms98-a-0029 144.340500 147.836625 which we do a a fair bit of traveling
sw4131A-ms98-a-0030 147.836625 153.201125 [silence]
sw4131A-ms98-a-0031 153.201125 154.640125 oh yeah
sw4131A-ms98-a-0032 154.640125 161.953000 [silence]
sw4131A-ms98-a-0033 161.953000 163.705375 yeah sure
sw4131A-ms98-a-0034 163.705375 165.210250 it's uh
sw4131A-ms98-a-0035 165.210250 173.862750 i don't know when you're when you're used to one thing i guess something different always seems like it would be fun to have or nice to have
sw4131A-ms98-a-0036 173.862750 174.991125 but
sw4131A-ms98-a-0037 174.991125 179.128625 [silence]
sw4131A-ms98-a-0038 179.128625 187.561250 yeah we haven't had it for very long we got it in September right around uh Labor Day i guess it was and so it doesn't have a whole lot of miles on it yet
sw4131A-ms98-a-0039 187.561250 197.504125 but uh up here in Rochester New York it's nice to have a four wheel drive capability especially on days like [laughter-today] [laughter-where] [laughter-we] [laughter-have] about six inches of snow coming down out there
sw4131A-ms98-a-0040 197.504125 200.140625 [silence]
sw4131A-ms98-a-0041 200.140625 214.712750 yeah i was a little uh surprised to find i i'm not the sort of person that's going to go out and shop for exclusively for an American built car but i am the sort of person that feels good knowing that the car they like the best [laughter-is] [laughter-American]
sw4131A-ms98-a-0042 214.712750 218.774250 made and American built but i was reading in the paper the other day that uh
sw4131A-ms98-a-0043 218.774250 230.386125 surprisingly enough a lot of cars that you think are American aren't always and in fact they listed the Jeep Wrangler as being almost exclusively made in either Mexico or Canada
sw4131A-ms98-a-0044 230.386125 240.137875 which isn't that far away but i it surprised me i always thought Jeep was about as American as you could get as far as manufacturing goes at least
sw4131A-ms98-a-0045 240.137875 242.460000 [silence]
sw4131A-ms98-a-0046 242.460000 243.590125 really

sw4131A-ms98-a-0050 258.693875 260.831750 no yeah
sw4131A-ms98-a-0051 260.831750 268.051875 yeah i guess you never know in fact they had a whole system uh decoding the vehicle identification number
sw4131A-ms98-a-0052 268.051875 274.647500 so [laughter-you] could figure out even right down to where the factory was which state the factory was in where it built
sw4131A-ms98-a-0053 274.647500 276.058000 yeah
sw4131A-ms98-a-0054 276.058000 276.587375 but
sw4131A-ms98-a-0055 276.587375 277.221250 [silence] 
sw4131A-ms98-a-0056 277.221250 278.256125 it was interesting
sw4131A-ms98-a-0057 278.256125 283.267875 [silence]
sw4131A-ms98-a-0058 283.267875 284.744125 oh really

sw4131A-ms98-a-0060 285.931125 287.607375 oh no [laughter]
sw4131A-ms98-a-0061 287.607375 291.322250 [silence]
sw4131A-ms98-a-0062 291.322250 294.377250 oh really what sorts of problems did you have with it
sw4131A-ms98-a-0063 294.377250 299.842000 [silence]
