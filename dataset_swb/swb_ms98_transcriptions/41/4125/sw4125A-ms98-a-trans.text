sw4125A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 3.652625 well Toby have you ever served on a jury in a criminal trial
sw4125A-ms98-a-0002 3.652625 8.855125 [silence]
sw4125A-ms98-a-0003 8.855125 16.020125 well i'm not sure whether you're the lucky one or i am [laughter] because i have done it and uh
sw4125A-ms98-a-0004 16.020125 17.762125 uh
sw4125A-ms98-a-0005 17.762125 27.929000 well we had a hung jury so i i came away really disappointed in the process or the least the people involved i was very frustrated about that
sw4125A-ms98-a-0006 27.929000 29.406875 [silence]
sw4125A-ms98-a-0007 29.406875 36.624125 i i think it was something like oh ten to three ten to two or nine to three or something like that
sw4125A-ms98-a-0008 36.624125 41.817500 which really means that if if we hadn't of had to have unanimous decision
sw4125A-ms98-a-0009 41.817500 43.737000 we would uh
sw4125A-ms98-a-0010 43.737000 47.010875 would have completed our mission if you will 
sw4125A-ms98-a-0011 47.010875 70.244000 [silence]

sw4125A-ms98-a-0017 100.319750 103.323500 [silence]
sw4125A-ms98-a-0018 103.323500 112.414000 well the the crazy thing about this trial was that the guy said yes i did this i did this armed robbery but he wanted a jury to decide his sentence
sw4125A-ms98-a-0019 112.414000 115.452625 and we couldn't even agree on a sentence
sw4125A-ms98-a-0020 115.452625 117.774500 [laughter]
sw4125A-ms98-a-0021 117.774500 126.837500 i i mean i was ready to put the guy guy away forever but i was dealing with people who said well if it were my son i'd want him to have another chance
sw4125A-ms98-a-0022 126.837500 129.054000 [laughter] i [laughter-know]
sw4125A-ms98-a-0023 129.054000 136.202750 [silence]
sw4125A-ms98-a-0024 136.202750 139.082750 oh is that right otherwise the judge does it
sw4125A-ms98-a-0025 139.082750 142.875000 [silence]
sw4125A-ms98-a-0026 142.875000 145.943000 do you think that's appropriate or should it be changed
sw4125A-ms98-a-0027 145.943000 183.651000 [silence]
sw4125A-ms98-a-0028 183.651000 184.456125 yeah
sw4125A-ms98-a-0029 184.456125 195.057750 well and i do not know if it is this way it all states or not but in Texas there are severe limitations on what the jury can kn[ow]- know about the the prior history of the alleged criminal
sw4125A-ms98-a-0030 195.057750 204.361250 and also what they can be told about the effects of sentencing Like if you give somebody fifteen years they'll be out in three weeks or something like that
sw4125A-ms98-a-0031 204.361250 211.041625 i maybe it's not quite that radical but but those things are not those are things are kept from the jury
sw4125A-ms98-a-0032 211.041625 223.933375 [silence]
sw4125A-ms98-a-0033 223.933375 226.132000 yeah why [laughter]
