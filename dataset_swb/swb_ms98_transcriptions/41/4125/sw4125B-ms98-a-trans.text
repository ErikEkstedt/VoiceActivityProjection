sw4125B-ms98-a-0005 12.037750 13.722750 [laughter]
sw4125B-ms98-a-0006 13.722750 16.496875 [silence]
sw4125B-ms98-a-0007 16.496875 18.364000 what did you think of the process
sw4125B-ms98-a-0008 18.364000 27.369500 [silence]
sw4125B-ms98-a-0009 27.369500 29.955500 how hung was it i mean what was the vote
sw4125B-ms98-a-0010 29.955500 34.163750 [silence]
sw4125B-ms98-a-0011 34.163750 35.335000 uh-huh
sw4125B-ms98-a-0012 35.335000 45.899000 [silence]
sw4125B-ms98-a-0013 45.899000 50.326625 yeah yeah but it's [noise]
sw4125B-ms98-a-0014 50.326625 59.456750 i don't know i i've always thought that the f[act]- th[e]- the fact that it has to be unanimous means that there wasn't any doubt in people's minds
sw4125B-ms98-a-0015 59.456750 68.930250 and if it uh if in like in your case if there's two people who who weren't convinced that the fellow was guilty
sw4125B-ms98-a-0016 68.930250 72.680125 then or innocent i you didn't say which way it went
sw4125B-ms98-a-0017 72.680125 74.050000 [laughter]
sw4125B-ms98-a-0018 74.050000 79.023000 it can go either way if there's two people that aren't convinced one way or the other then that's
sw4125B-ms98-a-0019 79.023000 89.771000 um you know i don't i think one one change that might be worthwhile would be to say that you need unanimous verdict to find somebody guilty
sw4125B-ms98-a-0020 89.771000 95.019875 but but if you don't get a unanimous guilty verdict then they're innocent
sw4125B-ms98-a-0021 95.019875 99.519000 because the prosecution didn't prove their case to all twelve people
sw4125B-ms98-a-0022 99.519000 100.760000 [silence]
sw4125B-ms98-a-0023 100.760000 101.795000 um
sw4125B-ms98-a-0024 101.795000 115.112000 [silence]
sw4125B-ms98-a-0025 115.112000 116.515750 huh
sw4125B-ms98-a-0026 116.515750 117.964875 huh
sw4125B-ms98-a-0027 117.964875 126.948375 [silence]
sw4125B-ms98-a-0028 126.948375 128.278250 that's ridiculous
sw4125B-ms98-a-0029 128.278250 136.681375 [vocalized-noise] um here in Georgia the only time that the jury gets involved in sentencing at all is in capital punishment cases
sw4125B-ms98-a-0030 136.681375 138.249750 [silence]
sw4125B-ms98-a-0031 138.249750 143.244625 the judge does all sentencing for everything except capital cases here
sw4125B-ms98-a-0032 143.244625 145.650000 [silence]
sw4125B-ms98-a-0033 145.650000 149.050750 i think it is appropriate i think that the judge
sw4125B-ms98-a-0034 149.050750 163.045125 probably has a much better uh feel for uh what sentences other people who have committed comparable p[unishment]- crimes have received and what the guidelines are and uh
sw4125B-ms98-a-0035 163.045125 172.014500 i- i think that by the time you get to that point all the facts have been settled the person's been convicted and the punishment should be
sw4125B-ms98-a-0036 172.014500 184.121375 well a fairly objective uh thing uh i don't know if there really needs to be all that much discretion in sentencing once you've determined what crime the person is guilty of
sw4125B-ms98-a-0037 184.121375 194.519375 [silence]
sw4125B-ms98-a-0038 194.519375 195.571250 um-hum
sw4125B-ms98-a-0039 195.571250 210.385000 [silence]
sw4125B-ms98-a-0040 210.385000 224.571500 yeah here in Georgia when they have the jury involved in sentencing like in a capital case the prosecution is not allowed to say that if you if you give them life he'll be out in seven years that's against the rules
sw4125B-ms98-a-0041 224.571500 229.892750 uh but in with the judge making all the other sentences
sw4125B-ms98-a-0042 229.892750 237.200875 uh course the judge has open to him all of the previous criminal history uh
sw4125B-ms98-a-0043 237.200875 246.415875 uh and uh obviously the judge knows what all the guidelines uh or what all the effects can be of parole and things like that
sw4125B-ms98-a-0044 246.415875 249.678625 um well i think the
sw4125B-ms98-a-0045 249.678625 255.284750 th[e]- the reform of the jury process that i would like most to see
sw4125B-ms98-a-0046 255.284750 266.160125 is for juries to be required to be informed of their right to judge not only the facts of the case but also the law itself
sw4125B-ms98-a-0047 266.160125 270.214250 uh juries and lot of people are not aware of this but it is
sw4125B-ms98-a-0048 270.214250 281.313125 it's part of the common law and it th[ey]- really is in Georgia it is part of the state Constitution and it is in the Constitution of a lot of states that if the jury
sw4125B-ms98-a-0049 281.313125 292.411875 uh believes that the law that someone is being tried on is unjust the law itself is unjust the jury can refuse to convict the person
sw4125B-ms98-a-0050 292.411875 299.170000 uh and this is sort of the people's uh last line of defense against govern[ments]-
