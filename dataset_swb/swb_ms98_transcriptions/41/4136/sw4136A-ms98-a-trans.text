sw4136A-ms98-a-0028 103.987500 117.985125 tried to listen to that every evening for the news and every morning and when i when i was doing that and reading the paper i really i really felt informed uh especially having the two different viewpoints uh slightly different anyway uh
sw4136A-ms98-a-0029 117.985125 121.031500 now i listen to the radio

sw4136A-ms98-a-0052 202.763625 206.742250 [silence]
sw4136A-ms98-a-0053 206.742250 210.668000 yeah yeah there's so much to know it is amazing
sw4136A-ms98-a-0054 210.668000 211.982500 um
sw4136A-ms98-a-0055 211.982500 225.338625 well uh one thing that was interesting during that whole thing was i would listen to the radio quite a bit and uh you know i started bringing a radio to work and i would listen a little bit at work and listen on the way home and on the way the way there and uh
sw4136A-ms98-a-0056 225.338625 237.207000 i really felt like i was keeping up pretty well and then i would watch CNN for you know fifteen minutes or a half hour and see a bunch of pictures and realize i hadn't really learned anything
sw4136A-ms98-a-0057 237.207000 241.251375 you know they sort of show planes taking off and uh
sw4136A-ms98-a-0058 241.251375 245.006500 like i i got more visual information but less
sw4136A-ms98-a-0059 245.006500 247.483125 real information in a way
sw4136A-ms98-a-0060 247.483125 250.996750 [silence]
sw4136A-ms98-a-0061 250.996750 252.242125 uh-huh
sw4136A-ms98-a-0062 252.242125 254.496250 [silence]
sw4136A-ms98-a-0063 254.496250 256.761500 yeah and it's almost as though
sw4136A-ms98-a-0064 256.761500 260.714875 that was stuff was more available to TV so they used it
sw4136A-ms98-a-0065 260.714875 274.015750 you know they have to show something and that's all they could show on TV they could i mean on the radio they would bring in all sorts of you know experts from God knows where and interview them and talk to them about it and speculate
sw4136A-ms98-a-0066 274.015750 277.990875 uh i think [vocalized-noise] in part at least because they had to
sw4136A-ms98-a-0067 277.990875 288.045500 uh which is kind of interesting so i just found that they the information per hour was much higher on the radio although the TV was a little more compelling
sw4136A-ms98-a-0068 288.045500 292.992875 [silence]
sw4136A-ms98-a-0069 292.992875 297.245125 ri[ght]- it's it's an interesting question about
sw4136A-ms98-a-0070 297.245125 299.298000 you know the bandwidth of the telev[ision]-
