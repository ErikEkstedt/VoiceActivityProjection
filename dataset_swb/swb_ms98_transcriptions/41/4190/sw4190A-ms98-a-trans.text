sw4190A-ms98-a-0019 73.165625 74.278625 and
sw4190A-ms98-a-0020 74.278625 78.608000 i had to have to have a tooth extracted and i had to pay cash for it
sw4190A-ms98-a-0021 78.608000 90.980375 and i asked the dentist how come you know the price is so high i sai[d]- i said i- i thought because you know the prices of medication you know like it costs them ten cents to to make a pill and they charge you two dollars an[d]-
sw4190A-ms98-a-0022 90.980375 101.988875 he said one of the reasons is the litigation for um claims against the doctors so they lawyers have got their their fi[ngers]- fingers in the pie too

sw4190A-ms98-a-0055 229.952500 238.121625 well what they would do is they would just cancel everybody's insurance and say we're not going to cover you and then the employees are out uh health insurance
