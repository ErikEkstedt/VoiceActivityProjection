sw4107B-ms98-a-0014 112.104875 118.986250 so you wouldn't walk around for a long time with a can in your hand because you couldn't found a uh a bin for it
sw4107B-ms98-a-0015 118.986250 120.005625 [noise]

sw4107B-ms98-a-0024 202.325750 203.343125 [silence]

sw4107B-ms98-a-0029 231.499875 238.768125 [silence]
sw4107B-ms98-a-0030 238.768125 250.328875 n[ow]- now that's really tough because_1 you read stuff and you can't tell whether a styrofoam plate is actually more or less wasteful than a paper one or some other plastic
sw4107B-ms98-a-0031 250.328875 253.980125 [silence]
