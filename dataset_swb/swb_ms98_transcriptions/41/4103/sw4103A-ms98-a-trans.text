sw4103A-ms98-a-0002 0.380500 9.998375 um the question was kind of interesting to me because i was just trying to put together a uh long term financial plan and a monthly budget the only thing i do now is
sw4103A-ms98-a-0003 9.998375 13.987250 uh put the data into Quicken i don't know if you're familiar with that

sw4103A-ms98-a-0008 33.052375 41.779000 i i've found that it's the only reliable way to keep a check book balanced actually because_1 what -[w]ill happen is my wife or i'll write a few checks and then we'll uh

sw4103A-ms98-a-0011 43.734375 45.410375 not bother to total it
sw4103A-ms98-a-0012 45.410375 49.872125 and then it it comes comes in just to do all the arithmetic so it [vocalized-noise] helps with that

sw4103A-ms98-a-0017 85.788125 89.509750 a daughter who's eighteen months and another one on the way so
sw4103A-ms98-a-0018 89.509750 92.634625 we need to start doing more of that just for uh
sw4103A-ms98-a-0019 92.634625 95.208875 you know saving for college and things like that
sw4103A-ms98-a-0020 95.208875 99.275750 we tried a way try to put away between two and four thousand a year just for that for

sw4103A-ms98-a-0030 133.650625 137.367625 yeah i guess we're we're just at the point m[y]- uh
sw4103A-ms98-a-0031 137.367625 144.513000 my wife worked until we had a family and then you know now we're just going on the one income so it's lot more interesting trying to 
sw4103A-ms98-a-0032 144.513000 148.577750 find some extra i think payroll deductions probably the only way we'll be able to
sw4103A-ms98-a-0033 148.577750 149.503125 um
sw4103A-ms98-a-0034 149.503125 151.973125 do it just you know kind of enforce the savings

sw4103A-ms98-a-0036 153.138250 155.963625 but uh it'll be interesting to see

sw4103A-ms98-a-0046 186.766250 190.466750 uh i was just curious what uh part of the country
sw4103A-ms98-a-0047 190.466750 191.604375 oh
sw4103A-ms98-a-0048 191.604375 192.896875 okay
sw4103A-ms98-a-0049 192.896875 195.190000 um Cincinnati actually
sw4103A-ms98-a-0050 195.190000 201.000000 i was kind of wondering if they'd be collecting people with uh the western accents or something like that i don't know how many people
sw4103A-ms98-a-0051 201.000000 202.000000 [silence]
sw4103A-ms98-a-0052 202.000000 204.567875 are uh going to be involved in this but

sw4103A-ms98-a-0054 205.841750 208.368250 well that's interesting i'm uh

sw4103A-ms98-a-0057 210.376125 218.911875 uh um actually uh i was kind of interested if you found out about the study by uh reading Telecom Digest or was there another
sw4103A-ms98-a-0058 218.911875 229.086875 [silence]
sw4103A-ms98-a-0059 229.086875 232.974250 oh okay yeah that's how i got it as well but uh

sw4103A-ms98-a-0061 240.606375 241.993875 um-hum
sw4103A-ms98-a-0062 241.993875 245.009625 yeah it'll be interesting to see what they [vocalized-noise]
sw4103A-ms98-a-0063 245.009625 246.020875 [silence]
sw4103A-ms98-a-0064 246.020875 251.189375 it'd be interesting to see how the data base [vocalized-noise] well i guess we're talking about the experiment and
sw4103A-ms98-a-0065 251.189375 253.321250 probably try to get back on the
sw4103A-ms98-a-0066 253.321250 258.549125 topic but uh it's hard to talk about finances without without
sw4103A-ms98-a-0067 258.549125 261.770000 getting to uh dollar figures i guess
sw4103A-ms98-a-0068 261.770000 264.562250 you know we could talk about some of the long range goals
sw4103A-ms98-a-0069 264.562250 265.617750 [silence]
sw4103A-ms98-a-0070 265.617750 266.758125 yeah

sw4103A-ms98-a-0073 270.245125 275.461625 well i think either my wife or i would like to pursue advanced degrees at some point
sw4103A-ms98-a-0074 275.461625 276.759625 uh
sw4103A-ms98-a-0075 276.759625 278.312250 i guess we'll have to
sw4103A-ms98-a-0076 278.312250 287.955000 factor that in if we['re]- if we're not working for employers that happen to fund that it seems like every year my employer scales back you know a little bit of their tuition reimbursement
sw4103A-ms98-a-0077 287.955000 291.687875 i mean they use to reimburse it a hundred percent and now it's uh
sw4103A-ms98-a-0078 291.687875 299.394000 now it's reimbursement depending on the grade you get in class and uh it's it's a real shift from what we had before uh because_1 we're
