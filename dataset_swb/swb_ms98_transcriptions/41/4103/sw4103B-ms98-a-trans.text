sw4103B-ms98-a-0003 13.474250 18.083375 yeah i've uh have some friends of mine who use Quicken and uh
sw4103B-ms98-a-0004 18.083375 32.366750 i considered using it once myself but i decided that the amount of information that would have to go in would be a lot of time keeping that up to date so i i kind of gave up on the idea of using Quicken at least for now

sw4103B-ms98-a-0012 64.837625 72.954625 it doesn't really seem to be too too tight if we r[emember]- just remember to keep everything up up to date and balanced
sw4103B-ms98-a-0013 72.954625 74.116500 [silence]

sw4103B-ms98-a-0020 109.984500 119.658000 we're to the point now where our financial income is enough that we can consider putting some away for college so
sw4103B-ms98-a-0021 119.658000 128.351750 we're gonna be starting a regular payroll deduction in the fall and then the money that i'll be making this summer we'll be
