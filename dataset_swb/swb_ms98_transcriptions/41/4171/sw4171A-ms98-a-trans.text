sw4171A-ms98-a-0020 64.071125 65.507500 yeah
sw4171A-ms98-a-0021 65.507500 71.283250 huh well i guess what we have is like a f[lex]- what they call a flex benefits plan where you
sw4171A-ms98-a-0022 71.283250 81.052750 you get like a certain amount of dollars and then you spend it on a cafeteria of whatever you want or need otherwise you can uh [noise]
sw4171A-ms98-a-0023 81.052750 84.961000 guess you can put also put money hold money back and then
sw4171A-ms98-a-0024 84.961000 90.564625 either use it or lose it and that doesn't get taxed or you can just have that money
sw4171A-ms98-a-0025 90.564625 92.843000 you know put in your paycheck
sw4171A-ms98-a-0026 92.843000 114.942000 [silence]
sw4171A-ms98-a-0027 114.942000 124.092625 yeah well it depends on which company you work for i know that like the the the one plan that everyone seems to be in in my place is uh
sw4171A-ms98-a-0028 124.092625 131.963000 you know you uh think you call it plan D [laughter] deductibles are really high it's like fifteen hundred dollars
sw4171A-ms98-a-0029 131.963000 142.816625 but if you go for the other ones you're paying too much money for them because it's unlikely if you're f[airly]- relatively uh healthy then it's really unlikely that you're gonna use that mu[ch]- amount of money you know
sw4171A-ms98-a-0030 142.816625 155.075250 so the it you know someone did start a cost benefit analysis and ends up the best is they take a high deductible and and take a loss what[ever]- whatever happens a be if you happen to be a healthy individual [laughter]
