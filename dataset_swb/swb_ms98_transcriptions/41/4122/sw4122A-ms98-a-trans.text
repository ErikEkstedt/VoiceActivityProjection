sw4122A-ms98-a-0027 78.567750 82.460875 oh okay so that's real simple yeah here uh
sw4122A-ms98-a-0028 82.460875 89.024500 it's just for the individual and if you want to cover your family you pay a little extra but not much
sw4122A-ms98-a-0029 89.024500 90.351000 uh
sw4122A-ms98-a-0030 90.351000 91.626375 [silence]
sw4122A-ms98-a-0031 91.626375 96.285250 yeah i think it's pretty significant benefit uh really uh
sw4122A-ms98-a-0032 96.285250 99.792625 makes you wanna stick around [laughter]
sw4122A-ms98-a-0033 99.792625 101.951750 [silence]
sw4122A-ms98-a-0034 101.951750 110.009000 [laughter-yeah] that's just what you want to hear about uh people who are individually insured you know once you get sick you can be booted right out 
sw4122A-ms98-a-0035 110.009000 112.298125 uh which seems kind of unfair
sw4122A-ms98-a-0036 112.298125 113.719250 uh
sw4122A-ms98-a-0037 113.719250 115.489500 [silence]
sw4122A-ms98-a-0038 115.489500 119.500125 yeah yeah we have we can choose uh
sw4122A-ms98-a-0039 119.500125 125.897875 a couple different plans they made they try to make it real flexible where if you don't use much you actually get cash back
sw4122A-ms98-a-0040 125.897875 135.761375 um so you can choose all these different plans some of which pay you know like everything and some of which pay very little uh you can also choose an HMO
sw4122A-ms98-a-0041 135.761375 148.069625 uh well i used to have that when i was single and i wa[s]- i found it very convenient uh and we have some optical and dental coverage that's i guess it's optional bu[t]- i think we can get one pair of glasses a year
sw4122A-ms98-a-0042 148.069625 155.367000 that's so yeah it's pretty good actually uh i think a anything under a hundred dollars we can get one pair of glasses a year
sw4122A-ms98-a-0043 155.367000 158.032250 but if you want something really fancy you pay the difference
sw4122A-ms98-a-0044 158.032250 162.084500 [silence]
sw4122A-ms98-a-0045 162.084500 163.444500 uh-huh

sw4122A-ms98-a-0049 172.858625 181.357625 yeah it can uh at least it's not like medical where it can really go through the roof you know at least somewhat limited um
sw4122A-ms98-a-0050 181.357625 183.915000 let's s[ee]- you have any kind of uh
sw4122A-ms98-a-0051 183.915000 186.598250 child care benefits or
sw4122A-ms98-a-0052 186.598250 187.853625 anything in

sw4122A-ms98-a-0057 200.904375 208.436500 that's a problem sometimes i understand when the baby's not sick but you know you have these periodic appointments and
sw4122A-ms98-a-0058 208.436500 214.524875 yeah the doctors end up having to come up with some ailment to cover the uh
sw4122A-ms98-a-0059 214.524875 216.951000 the appointment even though there's not really one
sw4122A-ms98-a-0060 216.951000 219.377000 yeah some seems more honest
sw4122A-ms98-a-0061 219.377000 226.422000 [silence]
sw4122A-ms98-a-0062 226.422000 235.905875 uh-huh well that's good that's good and d[o]- is there any kind of interesting uh wh[at]- i mean what happens after the baby's born is there some uh some maternity leave policy
sw4122A-ms98-a-0063 235.905875 241.065500 [silence]

sw4122A-ms98-a-0072 272.461000 277.185125 right and you pay a little more or certain things aren't as well covered but at least you have that option
sw4122A-ms98-a-0073 277.185125 281.440875 that's nice because_1 once in a while you find someone who deals specifically with
sw4122A-ms98-a-0074 281.440875 286.151750 you know what you have or or so[mebody]- just somebody you've dealt with already a
