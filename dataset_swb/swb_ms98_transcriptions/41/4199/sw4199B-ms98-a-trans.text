sw4199B-ms98-a-0043 148.983375 159.965875 well [laughter] actually terrible they built that Joe Robbie Stadium there in uh in Miami and it's not a covered dome and when it when it does rain down here in south Florida it just it just comes down in buckets
sw4199B-ms98-a-0044 159.965875 165.978500 and that particular Sunday it poured like it had never poured before and that place was like a giant funnel
sw4199B-ms98-a-0045 165.978500 176.999875 all the water goes down to the bottom of the field and the field just started filling up with water and in my seats up there they've got little drains but they don't they don't drain fast enough so we have water up to our knees
sw4199B-ms98-a-0046 176.999875 181.997750 and you know warm rains tropical rains are okay but after a while you get the shivers you get cold
sw4199B-ms98-a-0047 181.997750 192.013375 and it was just terrible interrupted the whole game and we went to the rest room for a while and uh there was guys emptying out the trash cans emptying out the plastic bags and cutting holes in them_1 and putting them_1 over their heads and stuff
sw4199B-ms98-a-0048 192.013375 201.455250 but the but the that that game they played the Pittsburgh Steelers and Miami was beating them_1 at first then they finally wound up losing at the end of the game so it was kind of a bomber game
