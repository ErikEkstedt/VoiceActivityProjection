sw4160A-ms98-a-0004 12.464125 21.583125 that's a good way to do it what what we usually do my wife and i fortunately she likes to keep the numbers and i- i don't um
sw4160A-ms98-a-0005 21.583125 31.667875 so what what happens is uh i make the money and she spends it but she spends it carefully and then at the end of the month she just tallies it up and uh
sw4160A-ms98-a-0006 31.667875 45.995000 we have basically categories spend this much in this area this much in that area and uh although i don't keep that in mind as we spend we do um kind of get to the end of the month and see how we did
sw4160A-ms98-a-0007 45.995000 55.987875 and uh you know at the beginning of the month too we also take out some some savings and put them aside so we we know we don't have that to spend that appears to work pretty well
sw4160A-ms98-a-0008 55.987875 101.802375 [silence]
sw4160A-ms98-a-0009 101.802375 103.496250 um-hum

sw4160A-ms98-a-0011 104.811625 110.721625 [noise] do you have a uh specialized program or do you or do you just use something like a spreadsheet

sw4160A-ms98-a-0015 117.493250 123.994375 we've got uh a couple of those but uh i've been trying to ge[t]- get my wife sold on a spreadsheet
sw4160A-ms98-a-0016 123.994375 130.475625 and have her uh doing it that way and she prefers still just to do it by hand um
sw4160A-ms98-a-0017 130.475625 144.214500 she says as long as she's dealing with the numbers and it's just adding them up and then subtracting from the the target totals she says it's just as quick to do that way as to to uh enter it on the computer and have it check the arithmetic
sw4160A-ms98-a-0018 144.214500 145.460375 so
sw4160A-ms98-a-0019 145.460375 159.008625 [silence]
sw4160A-ms98-a-0020 159.008625 167.238500 w[ell]- that's kind of the way i feel and uh i use spreadsheets a lot and a lot more than she does so i feel like she's
sw4160A-ms98-a-0021 167.238500 174.004250 you know if if she did do it for a couple months she'd probably like it but she was just that
sw4160A-ms98-a-0022 174.004250 184.999250 [silence]
sw4160A-ms98-a-0023 184.999250 199.276250 um our as far as our family budget goes yeah what we do is we kind of know what what we're making and we've been doing keeping track long enough that we know what we need to spend and pretty much all the difference
sw4160A-ms98-a-0024 199.276250 200.998125 goes
sw4160A-ms98-a-0025 200.998125 209.210875 uh well it goes into two or three different places what have what we call an education account where we put aside some money for each of our children every month
sw4160A-ms98-a-0026 209.210875 214.536125 [laughter] with the desperate fear that by the time they are old enough to use it it's not going to be enough anyway
sw4160A-ms98-a-0027 214.536125 227.993875 and uh then we have kind of just a savings account and and right now all we've been doing is taking that and and putting it away in a money market account we haven't been investing or anything like that uh
sw4160A-ms98-a-0028 227.993875 238.999000 yet we just moved last year into a home just last week bought a car and so we have some kind of substantial other commitments to take care of right now but
sw4160A-ms98-a-0029 238.999000 243.685375 we uh you know we even with all that we're still able to put some aside
sw4160A-ms98-a-0030 243.685375 245.986375 how about you
sw4160A-ms98-a-0031 245.986375 278.977750 [silence]
sw4160A-ms98-a-0032 278.977750 290.266875 well it's it's nice to have something you know people say that if you're if you're not saving money you're spending more than you earn and uh that's probably the case
sw4160A-ms98-a-0033 290.266875 295.714375 you know you never can live down to the last dime so you're either coming out ahead or coming out behind
