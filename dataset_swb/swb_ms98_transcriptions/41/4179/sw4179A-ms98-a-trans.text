sw4179A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 2.605875 [noise] a uh Golden Retriever
sw4179A-ms98-a-0002 2.605875 4.161750 yeah
sw4179A-ms98-a-0003 4.161750 6.246375 is it really
sw4179A-ms98-a-0004 6.246375 11.268500 we've had him for let's see he just had his fourth birthday
sw4179A-ms98-a-0005 11.268500 14.212125 yeah and we got him when he was about eight weeks old
sw4179A-ms98-a-0006 14.212125 16.505625 and uh
sw4179A-ms98-a-0007 16.505625 19.419375 he's pretty okay we like him
sw4179A-ms98-a-0008 19.419375 26.022500 he does that's the one thing we don't like about him in fact we threaten him in the summertime that we might just shave all of his hair off
sw4179A-ms98-a-0009 26.022500 28.888500 he'd probably look pretty funny if we did that
sw4179A-ms98-a-0010 28.888500 36.696500 he actually he just went to the vet yesterday to get his shots and everything and they put him on the scale and he's up to ninety four now
sw4179A-ms98-a-0011 36.696500 44.225125 but he's not a real he's not a real tall uh dog for a Golden Retriever he's kind of stocky shorter and stockier
sw4179A-ms98-a-0012 44.225125 46.701875 [silence]
sw4179A-ms98-a-0013 46.701875 58.920750 he is it's uh just me and my wife and uh he's kind of our temporary substitute for having kids i gue[ss]- we treat him like our kid right now so he's spoiled rotten
sw4179A-ms98-a-0014 58.920750 67.148000 because_1 i you can get away with that a little bit more with pets than you can with kids [laughter] how about you
sw4179A-ms98-a-0015 67.148000 69.331500 [silence]
sw4179A-ms98-a-0016 69.331500 70.643500 uh
sw4179A-ms98-a-0017 70.643500 73.432125 [silence]
sw4179A-ms98-a-0018 73.432125 75.336500 uh-huh
sw4179A-ms98-a-0019 75.336500 77.097875 yeah
sw4179A-ms98-a-0020 77.097875 84.489625 [silence]
sw4179A-ms98-a-0021 84.489625 89.329625 that's probably a good idea they're good though uh have you ever had a Retriever before
sw4179A-ms98-a-0022 89.329625 91.181875 [silence]
sw4179A-ms98-a-0023 91.181875 100.593750 because_1 i i find that they're good around other animals like cats and other dogs they don't tend to get real jealous or territorial they like to play
sw4179A-ms98-a-0024 100.593750 105.026000 and especially_1 with kids they love to play with kids in
sw4179A-ms98-a-0025 105.026000 106.304500 [silence]
sw4179A-ms98-a-0026 106.304500 109.470375 no he's pretty much an inside dog
sw4179A-ms98-a-0027 109.470375 121.094500 he stays in we we're kind of in a not a real busy neighborhood but more so than i'd want him to be out too much and he doesn't like it if we tie him outside he's he's really a wimp
sw4179A-ms98-a-0028 121.094500 131.251500 and when it comes to being alone uh now if you give him the freedom to walk around and go wherever he wants he likes that but he does not like to be tied outside he'll he'll just bark and bark and bark
sw4179A-ms98-a-0029 131.251500 135.220625 [silence]
sw4179A-ms98-a-0030 135.220625 144.922750 no he's uh taken to the training pretty well and uh he knows where our yard is and we have a pretty small yard but he seems to know the boundaries
sw4179A-ms98-a-0031 144.922750 154.755500 and he usually is good about staying within them although our next door neighbors have a dog too and uh she she is good friends with my dog
sw4179A-ms98-a-0032 154.755500 157.145750 and so he often gets
sw4179A-ms98-a-0033 157.145750 167.593750 to smelling her scent and will go over there to sniff around and stuff but he's pretty goo[d]- he stays out of the street and uh if i catch him i call him and he comes back
sw4179A-ms98-a-0034 167.593750 173.075250 so he he's pretty good about taking to commands and things 
sw4179A-ms98-a-0035 173.075250 174.698500 [silence]
sw4179A-ms98-a-0036 174.698500 177.223500 no we never did
sw4179A-ms98-a-0037 177.223500 184.463750 i i trained him on my own and uh this is the first dog i've had all my own as an adult
sw4179A-ms98-a-0038 184.463750 193.802875 we've had kid[s]- or we've had dogs when i was a kid but this this is the first one that i uh took in so i wasn't sure if i'd be able to get it all right the first time
sw4179A-ms98-a-0039 193.802875 201.857875 but uh he he seems to have picked it up pretty well i never really had to hit him or anything just you know firm tone of voice
sw4179A-ms98-a-0040 201.857875 212.840000 and those sorts of things i i see other people out there and they hit their dogs and try to and and those horrible collars that they put on them_1 with invinci[ble]- invisible fencing least i think i[t]-
sw4179A-ms98-a-0041 212.840000 215.488500 invisible fencing have you heard of that
sw4179A-ms98-a-0042 215.488500 229.914125 it's uh it's a system you can put in your yard where you bury these little uh transducers or emitters in your yard at the perimeter and then they wear a collar with a special little attachment on it
sw4179A-ms98-a-0043 229.914125 235.684375 and if they get too close to that perimeter it it zaps them_1 yeah [laughter-yeah]
sw4179A-ms98-a-0044 235.684375 236.786375 [silence]
sw4179A-ms98-a-0045 236.786375 248.293625 yeah well a friend of mine at work here said that he tried it with his dog and he wanted to see what he was subjecting his dog to so he held on to the collar and he walked out to the perimeter he said it was a good jolt
sw4179A-ms98-a-0046 248.293625 258.708500 yeah so i i don't take too well to to those sorts of training techniques i don't think they're always necessary if you put enough patience into uh
sw4179A-ms98-a-0047 258.708500 260.796625 um-hum
sw4179A-ms98-a-0048 260.796625 265.311750 it's uh is your cat an indoor cat or an outdoor cat
sw4179A-ms98-a-0049 265.311750 271.204375 [silence]
sw4179A-ms98-a-0050 271.204375 274.542250 somebody just told me that because of the leukemia
sw4179A-ms98-a-0051 274.542250 283.208625 [silence]
sw4179A-ms98-a-0052 283.208625 289.043375 wow quite a difference what uh what kind of climate do you have
sw4179A-ms98-a-0053 289.043375 292.877000 [silence]
sw4179A-ms98-a-0054 292.877000 293.935125 [vocalized-noise]
sw4179A-ms98-a-0055 293.935125 296.738375 [silence]
