sw4194B-ms98-a-0007 44.730250 52.999125 and the problem that i always got into was the hassle of keeping track of all the data and then deciding basically what we was going to do about it
sw4194B-ms98-a-0008 52.999125 62.230500 because_1 to me the need for a budget is especially when money's tight and i'm happy to say that money's not too tight we just kind of drift along
sw4194B-ms98-a-0009 62.230500 72.718250 uh we've gotten into troubles recently while the last couple of years we're all of a sudden uh it's IRS time and we look and say ooh we owe a lot of money 
sw4194B-ms98-a-0010 72.718250 77.783000 but we've even recovered from that and so i guess our budget is mostly in our head

sw4194B-ms98-a-0022 136.464875 148.997875 and so i guess my thought there is uh not to uh not to look at it and say oh my goodness i'm not allowed to do this on the other hand uh i think i'm ready to elect you to Congress uh
sw4194B-ms98-a-0023 148.997875 151.499500 uh in terms of actually considering a budget
sw4194B-ms98-a-0024 151.499500 152.248375 [laughter]

sw4194B-ms98-a-0033 168.489750 173.292250 and so i think we as a society tend to have

sw4194B-ms98-a-0035 178.994000 188.686000 and so i guess i'm kind of midway between the the party party party side and the uh uh oh my goodness we got to look at every last cent
sw4194B-ms98-a-0036 188.686000 202.993375 actually your story reminds me of uh when back in college uh i had overspent my budget which was kind of haphazardly kept but it became very obvious when i had something like twenty eight dollars left for the month of February
sw4194B-ms98-a-0037 202.993375 209.195750 uh and it got very obvious as to what i was going to do uh and some of that included eating

sw4194B-ms98-a-0042 226.221375 239.255500 you bet you bet i think the reason why they did it was they were afraid that somebody else was going to win the pool on whether i was going to die of berry berry or some sort of [laughter] disease like that
