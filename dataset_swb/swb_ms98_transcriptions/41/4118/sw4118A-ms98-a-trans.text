sw4118A-ms98-a-0007 44.443500 54.850375 yeah [vocalized-noise] up here like New Hampshire doesn't uh well where i am uh we don't have any recycling we don't even have a bottle bill or anything like that and that's 
sw4118A-ms98-a-0008 54.850375 56.110500 that's not real
sw4118A-ms98-a-0009 56.110500 60.110750 that's not real popular with the states around us because
sw4118A-ms98-a-0010 60.110750 71.267750 the the extra nickel or what is it extra thirty cents for a for a for six bottles ev[erybody]- everybody comes across the border [laughter] to buy the cheaper the the cheaper drinks
sw4118A-ms98-a-0011 71.267750 72.282375 but
sw4118A-ms98-a-0012 72.282375 84.922625 i- i i i think that well i do some recycling like i save my my bottles and things like that but i don't think i do as as much i think i could do more
sw4118A-ms98-a-0013 84.922625 86.481125 and i
sw4118A-ms98-a-0014 86.481125 89.535250 there's a big problem here with like landfills
sw4118A-ms98-a-0015 89.535250 91.106875 uh like
sw4118A-ms98-a-0016 91.106875 95.676500 they the the landfills are j[ust]- are just like filling up with stuff
sw4118A-ms98-a-0017 95.676500 106.830875 and i think that if if they were to recycle if i were to i guess if if there was like some kind of a program i would do it becau[se]- just so that we could save the space in those things
sw4118A-ms98-a-0018 106.830875 138.947125 [silence]
sw4118A-ms98-a-0019 138.947125 141.332750 yeah [laughter]
sw4118A-ms98-a-0020 141.332750 144.458250 [silence]
sw4118A-ms98-a-0021 144.458250 145.841375 i i was
sw4118A-ms98-a-0022 145.841375 155.479000 i- i don't know when i was in when i- i was [vocalized-noise] last year i went to a class and and uh we would we they they brought it this guy that uh that made 
sw4118A-ms98-a-0023 155.479000 168.501750 let's see he made he made a lot of money working be[cause]- because like in in the states like Massachusetts and Vermont and all the states around New Hampshire they put in this bottle bill do you have a bottle bill down there
sw4118A-ms98-a-0024 168.501750 169.553500 [silence]
sw4118A-ms98-a-0025 169.553500 176.198625 that's where it's like every ev[ery]- every every can is stamped with like a a nickel return on it
sw4118A-ms98-a-0026 176.198625 183.778875 and it's like you you have to like if you can turn the can in to to any store and they have to pay you a nickel for it
sw4118A-ms98-a-0027 183.778875 192.889125 but what happens is that then all these cans come running you know some stores get more cans than they sell and they have a big problem with that but
sw4118A-ms98-a-0028 192.889125 195.817125 the law says that if they sell they have to collect
sw4118A-ms98-a-0029 195.817125 203.843500 but anyway this guy like all the like the beer distributors were having like the biggest problem and uh
sw4118A-ms98-a-0030 203.843500 205.033875 he
sw4118A-ms98-a-0031 205.033875 210.762625 he he actually like made a business that just went around from like distributor to distributor
sw4118A-ms98-a-0032 210.762625 216.327750 collecting like all the cans and he said like some things like the aluminum cans
sw4118A-ms98-a-0033 216.327750 222.672625 they they could make money on because aluminum can be they can just throw that back into the pot
sw4118A-ms98-a-0034 222.672625 228.991875 and that just gets melted back up and that's not a problem but um like the plastic ones you s[aid]- like you were saying
sw4118A-ms98-a-0035 228.991875 241.637375 they they lost like big money on because they can't rec[ycle]- they can't reuse the some plastics can be reused but most plastics can't be [remelded/remolded] remolded or mel[ted]- melted into into other things
sw4118A-ms98-a-0036 241.637375 245.440000 and it just becomes more of a pain than it's worth
sw4118A-ms98-a-0037 245.440000 248.871250 but i don't know i i wonder you know shou[ld]-
sw4118A-ms98-a-0038 248.871250 252.813250 should they be making things that like just can't be reused
sw4118A-ms98-a-0039 252.813250 254.254875 uh
sw4118A-ms98-a-0040 254.254875 257.414250 it kind of i- i don't i don't and well
sw4118A-ms98-a-0041 257.414250 260.573625 should i be buying things that can't be reused
sw4118A-ms98-a-0042 260.573625 275.266250 [silence]
sw4118A-ms98-a-0043 275.266250 276.110375 i
sw4118A-ms98-a-0044 276.110375 281.432500 [silence]
sw4118A-ms98-a-0045 281.432500 282.072125 yeah well you know [noise] i- i can't something i can't figure out is it 
sw4118A-ms98-a-0046 282.072125 289.069625 do you ev[ery]- d[o]- you ev[ery]- did you ever see those big old Coke bottles you know the glass ones that were like they were kind of green
sw4118A-ms98-a-0047 289.069625 292.488000 at at what point in time did it get to be
sw4118A-ms98-a-0048 292.488000 298.562000 at what you know i didn't i thought they were great but at what point in time did it get to be worse
