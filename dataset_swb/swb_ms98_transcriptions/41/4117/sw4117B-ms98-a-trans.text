sw4117B-ms98-a-0007 47.642250 58.278500 [laughter-well] that's probably a pretty good objection um yeah actually i'm i'm in favor of it um [laughter-well] this ought to be an interesting discussion uh [laughter] um
sw4117B-ms98-a-0008 58.278500 71.474875 i my basic reason is that uh if someone uh willfully takes a life of another individual um i think that they have in most cases forfeited um their
sw4117B-ms98-a-0009 71.474875 81.970000 convention by which they agree to abide to when when they enter into society um you know they have there's a a convention that you know you shall not kill other individuals
sw4117B-ms98-a-0010 81.970000 92.027625 um and if you can kill with impunity um then that kind of makes you king of the hill in a society that that can't control you
sw4117B-ms98-a-0011 92.027625 100.518000 uh and if you've shown that that you have such an utter disregard for other individuals that that you kill uh cold-bloodedly or whatever
sw4117B-ms98-a-0012 100.518000 106.875375 then uh it's probably uh a good thing to remove remove you from that society
sw4117B-ms98-a-0013 106.875375 115.720500 um and one probably one of the more effective ways of of doing that is through the death penalty uh because_1 it's a highly visible sort of action um
sw4117B-ms98-a-0014 115.720500 124.753500 and it also sends a message that you know this this sort of behavior is not tolerable within the society and you will forfeit all your rights
sw4117B-ms98-a-0015 124.753500 128.990500 uh if you engage in such activity
sw4117B-ms98-a-0016 128.990500 130.329875 so
sw4117B-ms98-a-0017 130.329875 132.716375 [silence]
sw4117B-ms98-a-0018 132.716375 144.796000 well um yeah in a sense that you know that individual is removed from direct contact with society but that individual then becomes a burden to society a non productive burden
sw4117B-ms98-a-0019 144.796000 159.786375 uh because_1 they'd sit there and i mean their quality of life is horrible uh because_1 they're rotting away in a jail uh and the taxpayers are paying you know for them to sit there and twiddle away and and make license plates or something [laughter]
