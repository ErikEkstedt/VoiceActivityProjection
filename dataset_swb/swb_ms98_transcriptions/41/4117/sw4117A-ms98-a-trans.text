sw4117A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 10.027125 [noise] oh let's see um crimes and circumstances actually i'm i'm against capital punishment um probably not for the reasons that a lot of people are i'm against it because
sw4117A-ms98-a-0002 10.027125 19.090500 i really don't think that uh there are any crimes that warrant executing a person and the reason i think that is because i really don't have the
sw4117A-ms98-a-0003 19.090500 28.804125 belief that uh any particular person's life is worth so much that you ought to take this other guy's life for it i think you can either you know put him in jail for you know for some
sw4117A-ms98-a-0004 28.804125 36.384000 very long period of time or if they're really you know mentally ill then i don't think they can really be held accountable for their actions anyway
sw4117A-ms98-a-0005 36.384000 40.420875 so uh i just i i'm just basically against it
sw4117A-ms98-a-0006 40.420875 48.680500 uh [laughter] i also i also don't have enough faith in our [noise] our criminal justice system to to avoid getting the bloopers in there once in a while
sw4117A-ms98-a-0007 48.680500 55.112500 [silence]
sw4117A-ms98-a-0008 55.112500 56.494750 [laughter]
sw4117A-ms98-a-0009 56.494750 128.508125 [silence]
sw4117A-ms98-a-0010 128.508125 132.490875 uh-huh well is isn't locking somebody up i mean equivalent to that
sw4117A-ms98-a-0011 132.490875 144.457875 [silence]
sw4117A-ms98-a-0012 144.457875 146.491625 yeah do you i
sw4117A-ms98-a-0013 146.491625 148.167375 [silence]
sw4117A-ms98-a-0014 148.167375 149.411750 yeah
sw4117A-ms98-a-0015 149.411750 158.558625 [silence]
sw4117A-ms98-a-0016 158.558625 171.329125 yeah actually see i'm i'm sort of uh there are there are some other things i'm a[gainst]- i'm against also i thi[nk]- i think that jailing people for a really long period of time is is tantamount to sort of cruel and unusual punishment which i'm also against
sw4117A-ms98-a-0017 171.329125 178.042250 so and so so i'm sort of in this quandary you know i mean either you have [laughter] ei[ther]- either you execute them_1
sw4117A-ms98-a-0018 178.042250 184.639875 and uh you're done with it or you know you throw them_1 you throw them_1 in jail for some incredibly long period of time
sw4117A-ms98-a-0019 184.639875 194.646875 and then i think well i wouldn't you know you you don't want to be cruel to these guys and they say by throwing them_1 in a jail where they're you know they're constantly abused or what other other brother or uh o[ther]- other cell mates you know
sw4117A-ms98-a-0020 194.646875 198.212000 so so you kind of get into this hotel phenomenon you know where you
sw4117A-ms98-a-0021 198.212000 201.668625 got to set up you know some incredibly safe rubber room but
sw4117A-ms98-a-0022 201.668625 212.027250 you know then when you set up the rubber room you know it's so uh [laughter] it's so antiseptic that it's almost drives the person crazy if he isn't crazy already and so isn't that cruel and unusual punishment
sw4117A-ms98-a-0023 212.027250 225.103500 um on on the other hand i think there a lot of individuals who probably haven't really signed up to the idea of you know our co[ncept]- i mean most western people's concept of civilization you know
sw4117A-ms98-a-0024 225.103500 230.839000 and i i mean western in the sense of just you know western philosophy i guess um
sw4117A-ms98-a-0025 230.839000 238.573000 but [noise] you know i i kind of don't buy into the idea that uh that to have a society you necessarily have to
sw4117A-ms98-a-0026 238.573000 246.636750 to you know terminate somebody if they have stepped across that line because_1 i think there are probably a lot of instances where um
sw4117A-ms98-a-0027 246.636750 254.684000 you get into a situation where somebody hasn't really signed up to being in that society and i mean they kind of consider it almost they're protecting themselves or something
sw4117A-ms98-a-0028 254.684000 262.328125 and if society well for instance if society sort of forces themselves on somebody you know you hear it once in a while you hear about these incidences where uh
sw4117A-ms98-a-0029 262.328125 269.817000 some guy is you know off there in the wilderness or something you know [laughter] and and and he just doesn't wanna be part of society
sw4117A-ms98-a-0030 269.817000 282.110875 and society kind of invades his turf you know makes him wanna or you know makes him makes him sort of abide by their rules when he really wasn't even known to society before and he winds up you know shooting somebody or
sw4117A-ms98-a-0031 282.110875 288.444750 you know killing a cop who's trying to get him to you know come in to pay his [vocalized-noise] there's a million there's a million things 
sw4117A-ms98-a-0032 288.444750 298.946000 you know that i can ima[gine]- million scenarios that i can imagine where the guy would be sort of like hey i don't wanna be in this society you know leave me alone you know and he'd fight back and if he killed somebody you know he'd get the death penalty you know
