sw4133B-ms98-a-0002 0.943875 16.517375 [silence]
sw4133B-ms98-a-0003 16.517375 23.614625 right i think i've seen some statistics that say that uh it's more expensive to kill somebody than to keep them in prison for life
sw4133B-ms98-a-0004 23.614625 26.309125 [silence]
sw4133B-ms98-a-0005 26.309125 27.491750 right
sw4133B-ms98-a-0006 27.491750 42.093000 [silence]
sw4133B-ms98-a-0007 42.093000 48.924625 well that's committing them mostly is you know either crimes of passion or at the moment or they think they're not going to get caught or
sw4133B-ms98-a-0008 48.924625 53.252875 [silence]
sw4133B-ms98-a-0009 53.252875 54.474750 yeah but
sw4133B-ms98-a-0010 54.474750 55.979500 [silence]
sw4133B-ms98-a-0011 55.979500 63.055250 yeah but you also have to think whether it's worthwhile on the individual basis for example someone like uh Jeffrey Dahmer
sw4133B-ms98-a-0012 63.055250 64.199500 do you want
sw4133B-ms98-a-0013 64.199500 69.760375 by putting him in prison for life there is still a possibility that he will get out again
sw4133B-ms98-a-0014 69.760375 74.051750 whereas if you kill him [noise] there is not that possibility
sw4133B-ms98-a-0015 74.051750 81.947875 [silence]
sw4133B-ms98-a-0016 81.947875 87.100875 yeah i don't think he could ever redeem himself but in some cases yes
sw4133B-ms98-a-0017 87.100875 96.911750 [silence]
sw4133B-ms98-a-0018 96.911750 98.034875 yeah

sw4133B-ms98-a-0020 107.020000 112.736125 yeah it's it's yeah once you've made a decision that way it's a little difficult to go back on it
sw4133B-ms98-a-0021 112.736125 128.286875 [silence]
sw4133B-ms98-a-0022 128.286875 137.505500 oh yeah yeah it's a[ll]- the benefit of the doubt to the last iota is uh based on the uh person who is accused
sw4133B-ms98-a-0023 137.505500 151.122875 [silence]
sw4133B-ms98-a-0024 151.122875 152.379875 right

sw4133B-ms98-a-0026 155.969500 161.793625 yeah that there there they see that the profit margin of drug dealers the profit margin's so high
sw4133B-ms98-a-0027 161.793625 164.738375 that yeah the the risk is almost not there
sw4133B-ms98-a-0028 164.738375 174.349375 [silence]
sw4133B-ms98-a-0029 174.349375 175.428000 yeah
sw4133B-ms98-a-0030 175.428000 188.882250 [silence]
sw4133B-ms98-a-0031 188.882250 196.803875 yeah well it's also i used to live in Georgia and you know the the big thing down there was all right we have capital punishment
sw4133B-ms98-a-0032 196.803875 202.649500 but if you look at who gets accused and who are the ones who actually get executed
sw4133B-ms98-a-0033 202.649500 207.407250 it's very racially related and ethnically related
sw4133B-ms98-a-0034 207.407250 215.393500 [silence]
sw4133B-ms98-a-0035 215.393500 216.589625 right

sw4133B-ms98-a-0039 249.590125 257.423125 right and that and you know also by keeping them in prison you do have the possibility though we don't currently do this of making restitution
sw4133B-ms98-a-0040 257.423125 262.722625 you you will work your prison job and any money you earn will go to the victim's family
