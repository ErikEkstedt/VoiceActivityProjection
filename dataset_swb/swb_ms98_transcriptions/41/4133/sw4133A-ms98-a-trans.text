sw4133A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.758000 [noise] so um
sw4133A-ms98-a-0002 1.758000 4.701250 you know my feeling is that uh
sw4133A-ms98-a-0003 4.701250 16.687250 it's really being used today it it you know it it really isn't doing any real good purpose for anything because it's not cost effective because of the amount of time the people end up waiting on appeal
sw4133A-ms98-a-0004 16.687250 18.131000 [vocalized-noise]
sw4133A-ms98-a-0005 18.131000 22.095625 [silence]
sw4133A-ms98-a-0006 22.095625 26.984125 right because y[ou]- you you've got all all the prison expenses plus all the legal expenses
sw4133A-ms98-a-0007 26.984125 31.350000 um and you know it certainly doesn't seem to be a deterrent
sw4133A-ms98-a-0008 31.350000 42.499500 um for one thing because it's used so infrequently and for another thing because i honestly don't think the people that are committing the c[rimes]- crimes that would be eligible you know really care
sw4133A-ms98-a-0009 42.499500 48.122000 [silence]
sw4133A-ms98-a-0010 48.122000 53.208750 right i mean it's kind of like the AIDS phenomenon you know i'm invulnerable i don't need to care about this
sw4133A-ms98-a-0011 53.208750 55.977375 you know i- i- i'm never gonna get caught
sw4133A-ms98-a-0012 55.977375 69.529625 [silence]
sw4133A-ms98-a-0013 69.529625 71.452375 yeah one one way or another
sw4133A-ms98-a-0014 71.452375 72.587625 [silence]
sw4133A-ms98-a-0015 72.587625 77.740250 yeah but but the other side to that is if you put him in prison for life there's a chance that he might
sw4133A-ms98-a-0016 77.740250 82.673875 do things in prison or you know and somehow redeem himself
sw4133A-ms98-a-0017 82.673875 84.855500 [silence]
sw4133A-ms98-a-0018 84.855500 86.430750 well
sw4133A-ms98-a-0019 86.430750 90.258750 y[ou]- you know so that you know the the question is
sw4133A-ms98-a-0020 90.258750 100.918125 you know the other que[stion]- problem with capital punishment you run into is what are you gonna do about people who are [laughter-later] found to have been innocent you know there are cases where [vocalized-noise] you know twenty thirty years after the fact they're getting evidence
sw4133A-ms98-a-0021 100.918125 107.369500 especially as new technology comes along that might prove their innocence and then oops i'm sorry i guess we killed the wrong guy
sw4133A-ms98-a-0022 107.369500 109.807750 [silence]
sw4133A-ms98-a-0023 109.807750 111.994875 [noise]
sw4133A-ms98-a-0024 111.994875 124.354625 [laughter-right] you you can apologize nicely but you know you know i think you know the the price you know it i've heard quotes you know it's better that a thousand people go free than one person be unjustly imprisoned
sw4133A-ms98-a-0025 124.354625 129.340875 i think it is really the the philosophy of the way our legal system works
sw4133A-ms98-a-0026 129.340875 137.351125 [silence]
sw4133A-ms98-a-0027 137.351125 139.075500 yeah and you know
sw4133A-ms98-a-0028 139.075500 151.499125 the i i think that you know and the way it's being used now it's like you listen to Bush's you know well where are we gonna impose dr[ug]- you know it's like for drug dealers is the new big thing like in Tsongas is also saying you know capital make it a capital crime to be a major drug dealer
sw4133A-ms98-a-0029 151.499125 154.944000 and again i don't think these people care they risk their lives everyday
sw4133A-ms98-a-0030 154.944000 156.179500 [silence]
sw4133A-ms98-a-0031 156.179500 157.262625 [vocalized-noise]
sw4133A-ms98-a-0032 157.262625 164.153875 [silence]
sw4133A-ms98-a-0033 164.153875 166.644375 yeah and and you know [noise]
sw4133A-ms98-a-0034 166.644375 174.855625 uh especially you know i live in in Massachusetts you know w[e're]- w[e're]- we're gonna get capital punishment here probably after the second coming or something
sw4133A-ms98-a-0035 174.855625 186.277625 so you know but you look at our our crime rates and things like that and you compare them to to like Texas or someplace that does you know it it it's impossible to make a case that it's it's affecting it in any way
sw4133A-ms98-a-0036 186.277625 189.543625 i think it's mainly people like they get the vengeance of it
sw4133A-ms98-a-0037 189.543625 191.077500 because_1 you know
sw4133A-ms98-a-0038 191.077500 193.423875 [silence]
sw4133A-ms98-a-0039 193.423875 197.014375 [noise]
sw4133A-ms98-a-0040 197.014375 204.936500 [silence]
sw4133A-ms98-a-0041 204.936500 209.142250 oh yeah it's mainl[y]- lot of blacks also a lot of young people
sw4133A-ms98-a-0042 209.142250 213.508500 you know your a a [vocalized-noise] a sixty two year old guy is less likely to be
sw4133A-ms98-a-0043 213.508500 216.507500 put on death row from what i've seen
sw4133A-ms98-a-0044 216.507500 223.336500 and you know i- i think when you listen to like the uh the the victims' families and things
sw4133A-ms98-a-0045 223.336500 230.907875 they're always talking about you know uh feeling justified or feeling you know like they've gotten something out of it i mean
sw4133A-ms98-a-0046 230.907875 238.456375 [vocalized-noise] my thought has been once the guy has been imprisoned if he goes to jail forever or whatever or if he gets killed it shouldn't make any difference to the uh
sw4133A-ms98-a-0047 238.456375 245.186250 to the victim's family the only thing that should really i mean obviously if someone of mine who was close died i'd probably feel differently but
sw4133A-ms98-a-0048 245.186250 250.139375 you know th[e]- you know what the important thing is that they be caught and not be a danger to society
sw4133A-ms98-a-0049 250.139375 256.989250 [silence]
sw4133A-ms98-a-0050 256.989250 258.648875 right i mean the
sw4133A-ms98-a-0051 258.648875 261.898125 [silence]
sw4133A-ms98-a-0052 261.898125 266.413375 right and the the other thing is that you know i was reading through a book on uh
sw4133A-ms98-a-0053 266.413375 270.815000 genome human genome research and now more and more things like schizophrenia
sw4133A-ms98-a-0054 270.815000 283.118125 and what if it just turned out to be genetic or biochemical in origin so if someday we can go to Jeff Dahmer and say well the problem is you you've got an endorphin imbalance and you know if you take this regularly you'll be a sane and productive member of society
sw4133A-ms98-a-0055 283.118125 288.952125 you know you really get back to the question of you know is someone responsible for their actions
sw4133A-ms98-a-0056 288.952125 293.932125 [silence]
sw4133A-ms98-a-0057 293.932125 296.420250 society made me do it yeah
sw4133A-ms98-a-0058 296.420250 298.466000 [silence]
