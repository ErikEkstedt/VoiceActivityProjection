sw4106A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 6.299625 [noise] so it says how do you keep up on news um i suppose i had longer to think about it so i'll just uh answer the question i
sw4106A-ms98-a-0002 6.299625 20.003125 i get almost all well the majority of my news from radio and news letters which is kind of unusual but it's a pretty cost effect[ive]- or time effective way to do it because on TV you have to t[o]- put up with all the happy talk and the commercials
sw4106A-ms98-a-0003 20.003125 33.721375 and um then on uh like newspapers well they just take too long to read i use to read news papers very faithfully but i just ran out of time so i tape record Na[tional]- All Things Considered from National Public Radio
sw4106A-ms98-a-0004 33.721375 47.842875 and i- i when i ride the bike m[y]- ride my bike to campus i i [laughter-have] it on on my walkman and that gives me one side of the news and to get the other side i get a bunch of news letters from organizations which are mostly on the right
sw4106A-ms98-a-0005 47.842875 49.475750 and how about_1 you
sw4106A-ms98-a-0006 49.475750 54.476750 [silence]
sw4106A-ms98-a-0007 54.476750 55.499750 um-hum
sw4106A-ms98-a-0008 55.499750 56.475000 um-hum
sw4106A-ms98-a-0009 56.475000 64.486750 [silence]
sw4106A-ms98-a-0010 64.486750 65.562750 hm
sw4106A-ms98-a-0011 65.562750 69.688500 all the all the AIDS cases in Miami for example
sw4106A-ms98-a-0012 69.688500 74.982000 yeah that's right well i mean the the only thing about them is that they the the their news uh
sw4106A-ms98-a-0013 74.982000 86.242875 most of the time s[lanted]- tends to be pretty slanted to the left and you just can't tell really what's happening for i mean take for example the economy where they've not not not them alone but
sw4106A-ms98-a-0014 86.242875 92.296625 most of the news media but probably they [laughter-more] more uh strongly than a lot of the others
sw4106A-ms98-a-0015 92.296625 103.028625 have all these programs about bad economic news and as soon as the news gets good it just disappears you know ju[st]- just don't report it to the same extent that they do about the bad news
sw4106A-ms98-a-0016 103.028625 108.995750 [silence]
sw4106A-ms98-a-0017 108.995750 113.716875 hm i don't know but i think that for example after the uh
sw4106A-ms98-a-0018 113.716875 124.747125 after the uh Iran Iraq War when uh oil oil prices came way down i think it would have been news that oil company profits decreased as i'm sure they did you just didn't hear about it
sw4106A-ms98-a-0019 124.747125 136.910625 so um i- i get pretty upset with them actually a lot but the only thing is there's no other game in town except for monitor which is y[ou]- you know about um about the Christian Science monitor program
sw4106A-ms98-a-0020 136.910625 138.191250 uh
sw4106A-ms98-a-0021 138.191250 141.558625 no no on on radio they have an hour a day news program
sw4106A-ms98-a-0022 141.558625 142.767375 but that's
sw4106A-ms98-a-0023 142.767375 143.775500 [silence]
sw4106A-ms98-a-0024 143.775500 144.949500 i'm sorry
sw4106A-ms98-a-0025 144.949500 152.621125 [silence]
sw4106A-ms98-a-0026 152.621125 162.762000 right yeah that it i- i don't think they well i mean i know they don't broadcast it here at all and the only way that i can ever listen to that is when i'm in another part of the country so
sw4106A-ms98-a-0027 162.762000 170.469250 uh you know i mean they're they're really the only game in town and if you want to get different news for an hour or a little bit more than an hour that's
sw4106A-ms98-a-0028 170.469250 178.736625 that's about the only way to do it which i find kind of unfortunate now there is the McNeil Leh[rer]- Lehrer news hour but that's on TV and then you've got to be sitting there
sw4106A-ms98-a-0029 178.736625 193.215000 [silence]
sw4106A-ms98-a-0030 193.215000 194.494625 yeah
sw4106A-ms98-a-0031 194.494625 199.622500 [silence]
sw4106A-ms98-a-0032 199.622500 200.883625 um-hum
sw4106A-ms98-a-0033 200.883625 203.795625 [silence]
sw4106A-ms98-a-0034 203.795625 208.368625 yeah well at least it's not the same slant is is All Things Considered huh
sw4106A-ms98-a-0035 208.368625 220.063625 so that's that's true yeah bu[t]- now i like the Wall Street Journal if i subscribed well let's see if i subscribed to a newspaper i probably would get it it's it'd be that or USA Today but um
sw4106A-ms98-a-0036 220.063625 233.475875 they they have good in depth articles mostly on things that have to do with you know credit cards or other things relating to to financial things or or financial planning but they also have some good in depth articles beginning on page one
sw4106A-ms98-a-0037 233.475875 240.712125 [silence]
sw4106A-ms98-a-0038 240.712125 242.002875 um-hum
sw4106A-ms98-a-0039 242.002875 243.151125 [silence]
sw4106A-ms98-a-0040 243.151125 244.351750 right
sw4106A-ms98-a-0041 244.351750 257.668625 i was discussing actually one of those stories with i just happen to i don't know how i acquired a Wall Street Journal it just happened uh last month there was a story on recycling uh i think actually that was a column one story though
sw4106A-ms98-a-0042 257.668625 270.478500 but uh that talked about the way that uh some communities are trying to recycle so much that [laughter-they] [laughter-don't] have anybody to buy the stuff from them_1 to reprocess and in one locality i think it was Portland ended up burning
sw4106A-ms98-a-0043 270.478500 274.993125 the stuff some of [laughter-it] some of it because there's [laughter-nothing] else they could do with it
sw4106A-ms98-a-0044 274.993125 276.089625 [silence]
sw4106A-ms98-a-0045 276.089625 277.894500 yeah
sw4106A-ms98-a-0046 277.894500 286.438500 so it was it was you know good to find out a little bit more than than you would in certainly in any story on network news i mean not just
sw4106A-ms98-a-0047 286.438500 292.555125 that was the only thing but it was it was good uh discussion of the markets for various recycled products
sw4106A-ms98-a-0048 292.555125 299.138000 [silence]
