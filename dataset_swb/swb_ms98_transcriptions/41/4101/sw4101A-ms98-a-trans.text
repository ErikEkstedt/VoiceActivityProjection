sw4101A-ms98-a-0007 41.611375 47.269000 handicapped societies type of places where they uh [noise]
sw4101A-ms98-a-0008 47.269000 56.662000 one they do as just a recycling operation and then others they uh collect the paper and ship it to other retailers so uh we're able to uh [noise] 
sw4101A-ms98-a-0009 56.662000 62.864875 have drop off bins for news papers and cardboard and that kind of thing and then there are

sw4101A-ms98-a-0011 75.735375 86.895500 rehabilitation centers and then they recycle the containers [vocalized-noise] they refund the deposit which is anywhere from five to fifteen cents a container and then

sw4101A-ms98-a-0015 103.748375 110.156500 o[ne]- one of the scrap metal dealers that will accept tin and aluminum [noise] cans as well
sw4101A-ms98-a-0016 110.156500 121.559125 [noise] and and actually the recycler there is a deposit on aluminum pop cans and beer cans and so the recycler uh with the handicapped group will also accept those so [noise]
sw4101A-ms98-a-0017 121.559125 132.411500 uh it's fairly fairly extensive but again it's uh it's the initiative of the individual person because there is no coordinated pick up by the city
sw4101A-ms98-a-0018 132.411500 142.162125 [silence]
sw4101A-ms98-a-0019 142.162125 144.587875 well actually there's
sw4101A-ms98-a-0020 144.587875 146.928250 there's the opportunity for both
sw4101A-ms98-a-0021 146.928250 149.268625 [noise] generally the uh
sw4101A-ms98-a-0022 149.268625 160.819625 the handicapped group takes care of the things that actually the government has placed a deposit which is the inducement to re[cycle]- recycle the bottle so that you get your money back
sw4101A-ms98-a-0023 160.819625 169.106250 [noise] and then the recycler run by the handicapped society pays back the cost of that deposit
sw4101A-ms98-a-0024 169.106250 179.127875 and then i have a then then they in turn will get [noise] some money from the bottlers and from the the people that do the canning of the pop and the beer as as well [noise] 
sw4101A-ms98-a-0025 179.127875 212.515750 [silence]
sw4101A-ms98-a-0026 212.515750 221.355250 um yeah [noise] um i guess partly because of our climate here in Saskatoon at least the majority of

sw4101A-ms98-a-0030 231.500250 243.644000 we don't have much of a situation where we might call them homeless people we certainly have a fair number of people that are on [welfor/welfare] welfare and unemployment insurance that kind of thing [noise] um
sw4101A-ms98-a-0031 243.644000 247.077625 there's psychological pressure against
sw4101A-ms98-a-0032 247.077625 252.026500 employing people to do that kind of thing although um
sw4101A-ms98-a-0033 252.026500 253.844625 scouts and
sw4101A-ms98-a-0034 253.844625 266.045250 hockey teams and ball teams those kinds um regularly do bottle drives where they go around in various neighborhoods and collecting the bottles at individual homes
