sw4198B-ms98-a-0003 16.469000 17.763625 okay
sw4198B-ms98-a-0004 17.763625 20.992500 [silence]
sw4198B-ms98-a-0005 20.992500 26.036625 well it seems like its a tremendous pressure to
sw4198B-ms98-a-0006 26.036625 33.807000 uh reduce taxes and reduce government spending but that uh somehow it just seems to go up and up
sw4198B-ms98-a-0007 33.807000 43.175500 and [noise] seems like taxes go up and and benefits go down i don't quite understand it all i think it must be a result of centralization 
sw4198B-ms98-a-0008 43.175500 44.223125 [noise]
sw4198B-ms98-a-0009 44.223125 54.050875 centralization is suppose to um improve efficiency but i somehow i have a feeling it it uh reduces efficiency

sw4198B-ms98-a-0011 70.984000 72.805750 [noise]
sw4198B-ms98-a-0012 72.805750 81.498625 well i think one of the problem is again isn't really the centralization but uh the further removed uh you get from cause and effect
sw4198B-ms98-a-0013 81.498625 84.744625 further removed cause and effect get the the uh
sw4198B-ms98-a-0014 84.744625 88.154500 more problems you have i remember an incident um
sw4198B-ms98-a-0015 88.154500 89.180250 [noise]
sw4198B-ms98-a-0016 89.180250 92.291500 back when i was in Dallas
sw4198B-ms98-a-0017 92.291500 93.312500 [silence]
sw4198B-ms98-a-0018 93.312500 99.998000 where there were there was a push to to put in some regional airports and uh
sw4198B-ms98-a-0019 99.998000 101.288875 [noise]
sw4198B-ms98-a-0020 101.288875 107.484375 i don't remember exactly what it was but one of the reason for putting these in was that
sw4198B-ms98-a-0021 107.484375 117.499000 that they they wouldn't really have to pay for them i think they'd have to just ten percent or maybe it was twenty percent or something and they could get federal funds to do the rest
sw4198B-ms98-a-0022 117.499000 124.981625 and it seemed to me that that was a crazy reason that it basically if it was not uh beneficial enough to
sw4198B-ms98-a-0023 124.981625 138.488250 uh the local uh economy and the local residence to have uh regional airports around the Dallas area then why the hell would it be uh important to the federal government
sw4198B-ms98-a-0024 138.488250 150.782375 and to use uh the fact that you could leverage this and really only pay for a small fraction of it by virtue of having federal funds seems to me to be a good example of why
sw4198B-ms98-a-0025 150.782375 151.993875 um
sw4198B-ms98-a-0026 151.993875 153.763125 [silence]
sw4198B-ms98-a-0027 153.763125 160.476625 centralization or federal funding is a bad idea and why it causes us to have
sw4198B-ms98-a-0028 160.476625 164.998250 um increased tax rates and yet not much to show for it
sw4198B-ms98-a-0029 164.998250 193.995625 [silence]
sw4198B-ms98-a-0030 193.995625 195.539000 hum
sw4198B-ms98-a-0031 195.539000 255.970250 [silence]
sw4198B-ms98-a-0032 255.970250 270.544750 well i think it's easy to you know once you get in the position of power it's easy to just sort of relax and uh abuse that power just naturally without hardly trying
sw4198B-ms98-a-0033 270.544750 273.484250 [silence]
sw4198B-ms98-a-0034 273.484250 278.024750 it's hard to be ethical i think
sw4198B-ms98-a-0035 278.024750 280.493625 that must be why we see so many
sw4198B-ms98-a-0036 280.493625 285.491875 that i mean it's hard to be ethical when you are a powerful person is what i meant to say
sw4198B-ms98-a-0037 285.491875 289.754000 that may be why we see so many corrupt officials
sw4198B-ms98-a-0038 289.754000 293.984500 [silence]
sw4198B-ms98-a-0039 293.984500 298.562000 uh no i just think it's because power corrupt absolute[ly]-
