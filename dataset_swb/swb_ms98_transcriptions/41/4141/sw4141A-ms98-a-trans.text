sw4141A-ms98-a-0010 32.274000 34.788500 yeah i have a dog and a cat
sw4141A-ms98-a-0011 34.788500 48.732125 so oh yeah they it was uh a very hairy two weeks there at the beginning uh the dog was a little under a year and the cat was about six weeks old and it it was a hefty break in [laughter]
sw4141A-ms98-a-0012 48.732125 51.994375 [silence]
sw4141A-ms98-a-0013 51.994375 64.969125 well it was very it was interesting because it it's just you know part of their makeup they're psyche i mean they just hate each other automatically but after a while they they got to be good friends and uh
sw4141A-ms98-a-0014 64.969125 78.990500 luckily it's sort of a big cat i mean it's about twelve pounds and uh so he can hold his own against the dog and uh but they they i basically got the cat to keep the dog company and uh they they do that [laughter]
sw4141A-ms98-a-0015 78.990500 82.487250 [silence]

sw4141A-ms98-a-0022 98.809625 104.716500 well i'll tell you one thing i found with with pets um i- i think cats
sw4141A-ms98-a-0023 104.716500 116.497000 are easier to take care of especially when on a situation like you go off on a trip uh you know it's a real pain with a dog because you have to have someone come over and walk them and let them out and that kind of thing
sw4141A-ms98-a-0024 116.497000 122.493250 and sometimes i think wow if i had two cats i'd just you know get a feeder [laughter] and
sw4141A-ms98-a-0025 122.493250 127.965000 [silence]

sw4141A-ms98-a-0035 154.207875 155.236250 [silence]
sw4141A-ms98-a-0036 155.236250 157.996000 [laughter]
sw4141A-ms98-a-0037 157.996000 162.746625 that is interesting i hadn't ever heard anything like that but uh
sw4141A-ms98-a-0038 162.746625 173.208000 yeah we've been uh we've been pretty lucky too the uh reason we first got the dog to begin with was i lived i'm in school still and i lived uh closer to campus
sw4141A-ms98-a-0039 173.208000 177.999125 and uh as usual the neighborhoods right near campus aren't that nice
sw4141A-ms98-a-0040 177.999125 189.452000 and uh so we got the dog as protection and i guess it worked because we were never broken into and th[e]- but the people on either side of us were [laughter] so yeah uh
sw4141A-ms98-a-0041 189.452000 194.999625 [silence]
sw4141A-ms98-a-0042 194.999625 196.479375 [laughter]

sw4141A-ms98-a-0046 201.809875 204.488625 [laughter]
sw4141A-ms98-a-0047 204.488625 205.507250 [silence]
sw4141A-ms98-a-0048 205.507250 206.990250 yeah yeah
sw4141A-ms98-a-0049 206.990250 208.999500 [laughter]
sw4141A-ms98-a-0050 208.999500 215.760250 uh she's uh around fifty pounds she's a a very very skinny shepherd [laughter]
sw4141A-ms98-a-0051 215.760250 219.555875 uh well she's not pure and
sw4141A-ms98-a-0052 219.555875 230.255750 w[e]- we tried to figure out what she was crossed with we know the mother was a shepherd but uh she looks like she's crossed with like Greyhound because she is just thin as a rail and uh 
sw4141A-ms98-a-0053 230.255750 239.204875 [silence]
sw4141A-ms98-a-0054 239.204875 246.498375 [noise] yeah definitely and they're also prone to more diseases and uh skin problems and
sw4141A-ms98-a-0055 246.498375 259.522000 my sister has a a pure bred gold uh yellow Lab and that dog has every [laughter-problem] you could imagine you know it's allergic to fleas it's uh got another skin condition and just
sw4141A-ms98-a-0056 259.522000 262.775250 yeah yeah [laughter]
sw4141A-ms98-a-0057 262.775250 274.098375 so w[e]- we haven't really had much problems with her she's uh just extremely hyper and uh i guess that accounts for her her physique and she runs like a gazelle so
sw4141A-ms98-a-0058 274.098375 277.871625 it's fun to take her to the park and watch her run rings around all the other dogs
sw4141A-ms98-a-0059 277.871625 278.925500 [laughter]
sw4141A-ms98-a-0060 278.925500 282.987750 trying to play with them and they look at her like you're crazy you think i'm going to catch you
sw4141A-ms98-a-0061 282.987750 284.009625 [silence]
sw4141A-ms98-a-0062 284.009625 286.991375 so yeah yeah either
sw4141A-ms98-a-0063 286.991375 295.484375 [silence]
sw4141A-ms98-a-0064 295.484375 296.930000 right
