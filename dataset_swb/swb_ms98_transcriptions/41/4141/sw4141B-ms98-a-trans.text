sw4141B-ms98-a-0021 77.749875 83.194500 yeah that's that's actually why we got our second cat i we thought our cat needed a pet
sw4141B-ms98-a-0022 83.194500 95.023250 uh you know you tend to personify these things but our our cat thinks our oldest cat thinks that it it should be a person and our youngest cat actually thinks it's a cat
sw4141B-ms98-a-0023 95.023250 98.993875 so it works out pretty well um
sw4141B-ms98-a-0024 98.993875 108.474625 [silence]

sw4141B-ms98-a-0031 120.001875 129.093000 uh yeah you know an interesting story is i- i- i have a friend who has um a cat that actually knows how to open Tender Vittles bags
sw4141B-ms98-a-0032 129.093000 136.973500 so if they [laughter-go] on a trip they just leave the bags on the kitchen floor and the cat'll go and open one when it wants to eat
sw4141B-ms98-a-0033 136.973500 149.789875 i'm i swear to God it's like you know the i guess uh it earlier uh earlier time it would have to figure out how to use a can opener but you know now it it's pretty self sufficient i just think
sw4141B-ms98-a-0034 149.789875 158.459875 y[ou]- they say you own a dog and you feed a cat and i think that that's pretty much pretty much true
