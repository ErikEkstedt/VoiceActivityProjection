sw4135B-ms98-a-0003 4.497750 18.671250 well first of all i think they understated the turnout it's i don't i don't think that in a national election it's ever been under fifty three percent well it's it's it's almost half but it's been you know it's somewhere in the fifties for sure so it it u[nderstates]- it understates it a little bit 
sw4135B-ms98-a-0004 18.671250 27.499875 why do people not vote um well it's [laughter] the analysts usually say they don't think it will effect anything they're certainly wrong about that
sw4135B-ms98-a-0005 27.499875 39.449750 um i think that that it's easy if you if if you think things are going bad enough to just turn off to the news and just not pay any attention It's the less you pay attention the less you know about what's going to effect you
sw4135B-ms98-a-0006 39.449750 46.702500 [silence]

sw4135B-ms98-a-0014 68.338875 69.346000 [silence]
sw4135B-ms98-a-0015 69.346000 80.437125 that's right yeah and i i i agree uh i have made calls to various organizations the night before elections well one thing i d[o]- [laughter] i usually do is go to the library and study for an election [laughter] before it
sw4135B-ms98-a-0016 80.437125 85.493250 yeah and and try to get voter guides from newspapers and things and that helps a little bit
sw4135B-ms98-a-0017 85.493250 93.088375 they don't ask their they don't ask enough questions they ask on one or two issues and and m[any]- people can respond with platitudes
sw4135B-ms98-a-0018 93.088375 106.753000 what you really need to do [noise] excuse me is find interest groups that that you know who's inter[est]- whose issues you are interested in and then find how the if they have done a candidate survey and lots of times they have and then you have something to base it on
sw4135B-ms98-a-0019 106.753000 113.857125 there was a back when i was living in Pittsburgh there was a group called the association for public justice i don't know if you've ever heard of them per[haps]-
sw4135B-ms98-a-0020 113.857125 123.853250 perhaps not i- it's it's it th[ey]- they they really didn't you know it it sounds like they're some kind of liberal group well they were a little bit liberal on some things but they were a little bit conservative on some things too 
sw4135B-ms98-a-0021 123.853250 131.605000 and they put out this this [vocalized-noise] uh survey of candidates where they asked them like uh eight questions uh all the candidates for all the offices
sw4135B-ms98-a-0022 131.605000 142.093375 now it wasn't that great in that they didn't tailor the the the question for you know for the particular office so they asked people on the local level things that only come up at the national level and vice versa 
sw4135B-ms98-a-0023 142.093375 148.999625 but uh other than that it was a very good way to to see who you sympathized with and you could vote on the basis of that

sw4135B-ms98-a-0053 246.491875 258.952750 yeah that's right that's that's one point that was made that that you know uh i i read one article saying even if you don't think that abortion makes any difference at uh you know at a at a really local level like City Council or something like that 
sw4135B-ms98-a-0054 258.952750 267.265750 these people will in the end they might get elected to something bigger and the way that they get known is by getting elected these li[ttle]- to these to little offices
sw4135B-ms98-a-0055 267.265750 280.486625 so you got to look at their views and and that was a point that i hadn't considered the reason i ask about the organization is i just got uh started working last year in an organization called Christian Coalition which does just what you were suggesting and i was wondering if it was
sw4135B-ms98-a-0056 280.486625 282.765125 if it was theirs yeah
