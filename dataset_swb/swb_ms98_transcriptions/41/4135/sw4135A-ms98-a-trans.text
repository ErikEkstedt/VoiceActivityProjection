sw4135A-ms98-a-0010 58.499250 70.036500 h[alf]- half the people you know you really have to hunt to get information on them and you know as far as the local things go and if you know if you don't know them_1 then

sw4135A-ms98-a-0025 147.995375 160.465250 yeah i that's um i don't know what it was that we had that i had yesterday got it from someone in our church that uh it it asked uh
sw4135A-ms98-a-0026 160.465250 167.990500 it went all the way dow[n]- well it went to some of our constables but mainly it was in the Dallas area not in the Plano area
sw4135A-ms98-a-0027 167.990500 177.744875 but um it asked it had all sorts of questions about uh economics uh education and and uh
sw4135A-ms98-a-0028 177.744875 179.214500 uh
sw4135A-ms98-a-0029 179.214500 181.958625 family and
sw4135A-ms98-a-0030 181.958625 182.994000 [silence]
sw4135A-ms98-a-0031 182.994000 190.750500 yeah yeah but it had other things like um do you would you support um
sw4135A-ms98-a-0032 190.750500 198.000000 i know one that kind of stuck out in my mind was was would you support um a a two thousand dollar uh 
sw4135A-ms98-a-0033 198.000000 206.092875 tax credit for women that stay you know at home and and so it had kind of a variety of of um
sw4135A-ms98-a-0034 206.092875 210.339000 of questions and it wa[s]- it probably had twenty or thirty questions on it 
sw4135A-ms98-a-0035 210.339000 220.998500 it was really you know that was really good and helpful and it you know it had them you know supp[ort]- if they could support opp[ose]- oppose or or you know be undecided about it
sw4135A-ms98-a-0036 220.998500 235.033625 yeah it was it was it was uh i thought it was really good but you know it course it doesn't go through all the candidates and some of them_1 you know you think well this guy's this guy won't have any won't have any um
sw4135A-ms98-a-0037 235.033625 247.540750 say so about any of this anyway but it's kind of good to know their opinions anyway they you know run for a different kind of office so i think once you're in politics you probably stay in politics i would think 
sw4135A-ms98-a-0038 247.540750 266.447750 [silence]
