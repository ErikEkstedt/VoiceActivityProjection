sw4185B-ms98-a-0034 153.399750 161.817625 yeah i'm a Christian and i know that that God is supposed to be your priority but your family's priority above church work
sw4185B-ms98-a-0035 161.817625 166.998000 is is what i've always believed my dad was chairman of the deacons in our church
sw4185B-ms98-a-0036 166.998000 177.230250 and he put time with the ch[urch]- church uh uh the church burned by accident um uh uh the you know when i was real young and we were in the process of building another house
sw4185B-ms98-a-0037 177.230250 185.215625 and my dad put working on the church building uh before working with my mother on the house kind of left it to her
sw4185B-ms98-a-0038 185.215625 194.917875 and really left the family completely behind to work on the church and to be you know what everybody would consider to be a good leader of the church
sw4185B-ms98-a-0039 194.917875 205.126500 right right and and he had more of a desire to be with with the rest of the church members than he did with us and so that that was definitely a problem
sw4185B-ms98-a-0040 205.126500 218.167500 and uh when when my parents divorced i- i think my mother has had trouble staying in church because um she's just she just knows that there's a lot of hypocrites and um
sw4185B-ms98-a-0041 218.167500 222.004125 that yo[u]- you just have to put that part behind you
sw4185B-ms98-a-0042 222.004125 225.255000 oh sure sure and
sw4185B-ms98-a-0043 225.255000 238.209625 oh sure and not everybody is going to get [laughter-along] but uh yeah that that was definitely a a a problem in our in the marriage and they didn't communicate well at all so
sw4185B-ms98-a-0044 238.209625 248.524250 since they weren't spending time with each other hardly at all you know my dad would come home late from work because_1 he'd visit everyone in the community before he'd come home um
