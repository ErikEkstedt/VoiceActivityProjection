sw4157B-ms98-a-0003 2.262500 14.008500 um i li[ved]- i lived in Sweden for two years and in Sweden they have socialized medicine and so i saw some of the good [noise] and also i saw some of the bad that results from such a program
sw4157B-ms98-a-0004 14.008500 18.971125 uh some of the some of the good obviously that nobody has to worry about health care
sw4157B-ms98-a-0005 18.971125 29.466875 so it's a very it's a very uh comfortable i mean our people are very comfortable in the sense that you know there's no medical emergency that's going to make you destitute for life
sw4157B-ms98-a-0006 29.466875 42.971000 um the bad was more apparent i think at least for me because i think it affected people's lives on in a way that you could see one one thing that i noticed is it's very very convenient to be alcoholic in Sweden
sw4157B-ms98-a-0007 42.971000 48.771750 because it's treated as a disease now i don't know if that necessarily has to be part of socialized medicine but
sw4157B-ms98-a-0008 48.771750 60.484875 uh if you're [noise] if you're alcoholic then you're treated as if you're on disability long-term disability and so there was very little incentive for people to get out of that
sw4157B-ms98-a-0009 60.484875 67.999375 also um another thing that that i noticed that was very strange i was uh i would go down all these uh
sw4157B-ms98-a-0010 67.999375 79.030375 i remember this one row of houses and they were uh row houses or townhouses all connected together so it was like lower middle-class housing well it'd be lower middle-class housing here it's probably
sw4157B-ms98-a-0011 79.030375 90.246125 middle-class housing there um and there was a taxi driver that lived in one of these and there was a doctor that lived in one of these the one guy was a doctor and one was a taxi driver and so
sw4157B-ms98-a-0012 90.246125 93.032125 their their incomes were about the same
sw4157B-ms98-a-0013 93.032125 100.674000 whereas here there's a great incentive to be a doctor because there's a great financial reward and that that didn't exist in Sweden
sw4157B-ms98-a-0014 100.674000 109.227750 and uh overall i gue[ss]- their their health care suffered a fair amount from just the fact that the doctor salaries were lower and it was it was
sw4157B-ms98-a-0015 109.227750 116.489375 less professional and it was treated more like a like a taxi driver [laughter-type] job then a then a doctor type job
sw4157B-ms98-a-0016 116.489375 199.288250 [silence]
sw4157B-ms98-a-0017 199.288250 200.499625 right
sw4157B-ms98-a-0018 200.499625 211.732000 [silence]
sw4157B-ms98-a-0019 211.732000 213.978375 you don't think it's abnormal
sw4157B-ms98-a-0020 213.978375 216.322250 [silence]
sw4157B-ms98-a-0021 216.322250 219.782000 oh i see you're not saying it's right you're just saying it's common
sw4157B-ms98-a-0022 219.782000 288.491750 [silence]
sw4157B-ms98-a-0023 288.491750 290.242375 yes
