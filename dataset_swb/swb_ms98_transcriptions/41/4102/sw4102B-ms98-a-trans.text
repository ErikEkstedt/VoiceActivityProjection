sw4102B-ms98-a-0003 3.624000 9.229625 well i think um the elderly is a really neat population to care for
sw4102B-ms98-a-0004 9.229625 11.308875 they've got a lot of special needs
sw4102B-ms98-a-0005 11.308875 14.070125 and at the same time
sw4102B-ms98-a-0006 14.070125 15.133500 um
sw4102B-ms98-a-0007 15.133500 17.688750 majority of them don't want to give up
sw4102B-ms98-a-0008 17.688750 19.897875 the independence that they have
sw4102B-ms98-a-0009 19.897875 21.142000 [noise]
sw4102B-ms98-a-0010 21.142000 24.455625 and so you've got a real balance to make there
sw4102B-ms98-a-0011 24.455625 25.917875 what about you
sw4102B-ms98-a-0012 25.917875 37.450875 [silence]

sw4102B-ms98-a-0020 81.293125 82.562750 oh really
sw4102B-ms98-a-0021 82.562750 86.203875 [silence]
sw4102B-ms98-a-0022 86.203875 87.872750 oh okay
sw4102B-ms98-a-0023 87.872750 95.600625 [silence]
sw4102B-ms98-a-0024 95.600625 100.108500 yeah but it gets hard my my grandmother is in her mid eighties
sw4102B-ms98-a-0025 100.108500 107.092875 and she's uh suffering from a low uh well uh progressive Alzheimer's disease
sw4102B-ms98-a-0026 107.092875 110.338500 so she doesn't remember anybody
sw4102B-ms98-a-0027 110.338500 111.564375 and
sw4102B-ms98-a-0028 111.564375 116.402625 uh she remembers things but they are things back whenever she was real young
sw4102B-ms98-a-0029 116.402625 123.847375 and so with she was living by herself but my uh uncle has moved in with her to take care of her
sw4102B-ms98-a-0030 123.847375 126.946000 and it's creating a lot of problems
sw4102B-ms98-a-0031 126.946000 128.224250 [silence]
sw4102B-ms98-a-0032 128.224250 130.226875 oh yes yes
sw4102B-ms98-a-0033 130.226875 142.350625 [silence]
sw4102B-ms98-a-0034 142.350625 150.265875 in Dallas um yeah i've he[ard]- i've heard of several things and they are really neat programs to be able to do if you can link up with them
sw4102B-ms98-a-0035 150.265875 160.656375 but sometimes it's hard to either find the connections to get them in or uh to be able to get them there [vocalized-noise] for the day program and pick them up
sw4102B-ms98-a-0036 160.656375 162.155250 [silence]
sw4102B-ms98-a-0037 162.155250 163.439250 right
sw4102B-ms98-a-0038 163.439250 181.196500 [silence]
sw4102B-ms98-a-0039 181.196500 182.607625 oh really
sw4102B-ms98-a-0040 182.607625 186.055125 [silence]
sw4102B-ms98-a-0041 186.055125 187.060625 um-hum
sw4102B-ms98-a-0042 187.060625 195.206125 [silence]
sw4102B-ms98-a-0043 195.206125 196.286625 um-hum
sw4102B-ms98-a-0044 196.286625 197.367125 um-hum
sw4102B-ms98-a-0045 197.367125 206.137500 well it's it's it's a really day care programs are really neat you know and if the peop[le]- if the people are able
sw4102B-ms98-a-0046 206.137500 217.316875 and and can get up and move and everything like that that is one of the best things to do but i think the hardest thing to do is whenever you've got a person who's mentally very alert and active
sw4102B-ms98-a-0047 217.316875 219.663250 and their body just hasn't kept up with them
sw4102B-ms98-a-0048 219.663250 220.823750 [silence]
sw4102B-ms98-a-0049 220.823750 228.436625 and i think that's in a way somewhere some an area where some of the day care uh programs have left off
sw4102B-ms98-a-0050 228.436625 232.374000 because you really kind of have to be a little bit mobile to be able to do those
sw4102B-ms98-a-0051 232.374000 237.566375 [silence]
sw4102B-ms98-a-0052 237.566375 238.888250 right
sw4102B-ms98-a-0053 238.888250 247.203000 cause i know there's one not too far from from me here in Dallas uh and they have ceramics and pottery and needle work
sw4102B-ms98-a-0054 247.203000 248.834750 and sports
sw4102B-ms98-a-0055 248.834750 251.215375 but if your vision is gone
sw4102B-ms98-a-0056 251.215375 253.550750 and you have arthritis real badly
sw4102B-ms98-a-0057 253.550750 254.949250 [silence]
sw4102B-ms98-a-0058 254.949250 256.674000 yeah you can't do it
sw4102B-ms98-a-0059 256.674000 258.631000 [silence]
sw4102B-ms98-a-0060 258.631000 260.072250 well that's true
sw4102B-ms98-a-0061 260.072250 264.389875 [silence]

sw4102B-ms98-a-0065 278.017125 284.207500 and they love to recollect i mean they just you know and they will just go on and on with these stories and they have such a memory
sw4102B-ms98-a-0066 284.207500 286.900875 [silence]
sw4102B-ms98-a-0067 286.900875 294.244625 my grandmother doesn't [laughter] she wou[ld]- she wants to te[ll]- to tell you about her story over again so
sw4102B-ms98-a-0068 294.244625 296.966875 which is fine you know so
