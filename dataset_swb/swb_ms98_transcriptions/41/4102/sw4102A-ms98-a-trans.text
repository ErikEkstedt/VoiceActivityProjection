sw4102A-ms98-a-0009 25.438625 37.913250 well i'm thinking about it more in terms of my parents that are starting to get old They aren't really that old but they are sort of wearing out My mamma is a dialysis patient

sw4102A-ms98-a-0011 46.460750 53.488000 and so she's phasing out and but she's also a very very very independent person
sw4102A-ms98-a-0012 53.488000 57.546625 and doesn't like having having people
sw4102A-ms98-a-0013 57.546625 61.530000 uh not being able to do things for herself when she wants to
sw4102A-ms98-a-0014 61.530000 63.101000 uh
sw4102A-ms98-a-0015 63.101000 72.003750 i know they certainly don't want to be in a nursing home but my daddy keeps talking about it i don't i couldn't possibly couldn't never see him in a nursing home
