sw4166B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.590375 [noise]
sw4166B-ms98-a-0002 0.590375 38.608250 [silence]
sw4166B-ms98-a-0003 38.608250 40.510250 well that sounds good
sw4166B-ms98-a-0004 40.510250 53.497750 [silence]
sw4166B-ms98-a-0005 53.497750 56.369875 i've heard the name and that's about all it goes
sw4166B-ms98-a-0006 56.369875 70.040000 [silence]
sw4166B-ms98-a-0007 70.040000 77.436250 yeah that's one problem with the the nursing home environment it the elderly even out of the nursing home are very open to abuse
sw4166B-ms98-a-0008 77.436250 85.737750 um you know they don't always have their full wits about them they're not completely up on what should be going on or what's not going on
sw4166B-ms98-a-0009 85.737750 88.256000 and it can be pretty sad i've
sw4166B-ms98-a-0010 88.256000 96.659250 got a had a grandmother who had a stroke and she was in a nursing home for four or five years before she died
sw4166B-ms98-a-0011 96.659250 102.405000 and you know it's the the type of thing that she was living down in Florida my families was up in Maryland 
sw4166B-ms98-a-0012 102.405000 106.352125 and the other part of her family was up in uh New York state
sw4166B-ms98-a-0013 106.352125 111.965000 and you know it was very difficult for either of them or my grandfather to take care of her since she was
sw4166B-ms98-a-0014 111.965000 116.187750 um you know could not do very much for herself after the stroke
sw4166B-ms98-a-0015 116.187750 118.912875 and you know the nursing home was the
sw4166B-ms98-a-0016 118.912875 121.574500 you know best facility to put her in
sw4166B-ms98-a-0017 121.574500 129.228375 you know besides moving her up which is not a practical solution since both my parents work and both my uh aunts and uncle work
sw4166B-ms98-a-0018 129.228375 136.257375 which means it's you know very difficult for some[one]- you essentially need to have someone taking care of the person full time
sw4166B-ms98-a-0019 136.257375 144.008625 and you know there's also a lot of medical problems that can't always be completely handled in home
sw4166B-ms98-a-0020 144.008625 147.783125 which makes it you know it's it's a necessary evil i think
sw4166B-ms98-a-0021 147.783125 153.866750 [silence]
sw4166B-ms98-a-0022 153.866750 154.833375 yeah
sw4166B-ms98-a-0023 154.833375 159.103500 [silence]
sw4166B-ms98-a-0024 159.103500 169.377375 yeah and you know even there you have to watch out for you know you get one person who's a little bit dishonest working in there and you know the elderly sometimes have a lot of jewelry
sw4166B-ms98-a-0025 169.377375 174.297625 and other stuff that just very easily tends to disappear in the nursing homes
sw4166B-ms98-a-0026 174.297625 192.579500 [silence]
sw4166B-ms98-a-0027 192.579500 193.487875 uh-huh
sw4166B-ms98-a-0028 193.487875 198.274125 [silence]
sw4166B-ms98-a-0029 198.274125 199.110375 yeah
sw4166B-ms98-a-0030 199.110375 201.906125 [silence]
sw4166B-ms98-a-0031 201.906125 203.053250 uh-huh
sw4166B-ms98-a-0032 203.053250 218.411875 [silence]
sw4166B-ms98-a-0033 218.411875 224.670625 either that or they're just so understaffed that they uh can't afford to put in the uh care that they need
sw4166B-ms98-a-0034 224.670625 227.749875 because_1 it's you know an elderly person can
sw4166B-ms98-a-0035 227.749875 231.688500 you know it's like a newborn baby you need to have twenty four hour care
sw4166B-ms98-a-0036 231.688500 235.640000 uh answering all the needs because_1 they can't do much for themselves at certain points
sw4166B-ms98-a-0037 235.640000 237.943000 [silence]
sw4166B-ms98-a-0038 237.943000 239.435375 uh-huh
sw4166B-ms98-a-0039 239.435375 245.851000 and you know there's a lot of number of the elderly are very you know complaining because they remember the way that things used to be
sw4166B-ms98-a-0040 245.851000 250.331875 and remember being able to do things for themselves which you know they no longer can
sw4166B-ms98-a-0041 250.331875 253.387000 and it very very hard for them to accept that
sw4166B-ms98-a-0042 253.387000 255.345750 [silence]
sw4166B-ms98-a-0043 255.345750 259.317250 we just uh moved my grandfather into
sw4166B-ms98-a-0044 259.317250 263.167500 not a nursing home but you know a transitional type facility
sw4166B-ms98-a-0045 263.167500 264.477875 [silence]
sw4166B-ms98-a-0046 264.477875 271.460500 more of a retirement home he's got his own efficiency apartment and they provide one meal a day
sw4166B-ms98-a-0047 271.460500 279.970375 and you know the rest of the housekeeping and other meals a day are up to him but they do have you know group activities going on
sw4166B-ms98-a-0048 279.970375 281.168625 [silence]
sw4166B-ms98-a-0049 281.168625 285.344625 uh he'd much rather be living alone in his apartment down in Florida
sw4166B-ms98-a-0050 285.344625 290.049125 uh you know to move into that facility we moved him from Florida up to Maryland and
sw4166B-ms98-a-0051 290.049125 294.346625 it's it's a bit of a shock to the system {weatherwise} if nothing else
sw4166B-ms98-a-0052 294.346625 296.935625 [silence]
sw4166B-ms98-a-0053 296.935625 299.609375 well there was stuff like that in Florida but
sw4166B-ms98-a-0054 299.609375 300.002000 [silence]
