sw4109A-ms98-a-0004 9.867375 11.152875 okay
sw4109A-ms98-a-0005 11.152875 12.415625 [silence]
sw4109A-ms98-a-0006 12.415625 17.372000 [noise] okay [noise] so i just press one then right okay ready
sw4109A-ms98-a-0007 17.372000 18.077875 okay
sw4109A-ms98-a-0008 18.077875 18.990250 [noise]
sw4109A-ms98-a-0009 18.990250 27.289000 [silence]
sw4109A-ms98-a-0010 27.289000 36.623250 well right now i'm i'm just a student i only work part time but i i've work in the job force before and
sw4109A-ms98-a-0011 36.623250 43.452250 forty hours is just too long you just don't have any time to do anything it it seems like S[aturday]-
sw4109A-ms98-a-0012 43.452250 47.861500 Saturday you you get off but Sunday you're getting ready for Monday
sw4109A-ms98-a-0013 47.861500 56.198375 and if we could have us if we could have a thirty two hour work week well that'd happen is that for every four people we'd give another job
sw4109A-ms98-a-0014 56.198375 66.627250 and then that way that everybody would have a three day holiday okay and that way that more that that would make a a bigger market we'd have uh
sw4109A-ms98-a-0015 66.627250 77.997125 more recreation people would have time to do it there'd be less of a stress level we'd have le[ss]- we'd have less crime we'd have to we'd have to build less prisons we'd nee[d]- you know less police force 
sw4109A-ms98-a-0016 77.997125 85.951250 [silence]
sw4109A-ms98-a-0017 85.951250 95.237500 it it that's that's that's a that's a possibility one o[f]- one of the problems they're facing now a lot of people now is that the health insurance
sw4109A-ms98-a-0018 95.237500 101.028875 is that the small businesses can't a[fford]- can't offer us health insurance
sw4109A-ms98-a-0019 101.028875 109.518250 and it it it's too costly and then what i[s]- what is happening is that they're on um
sw4109A-ms98-a-0020 109.518250 123.106125 a policy where they have s[o]- X amount of of users in it okay and so they get a specific rate well what happens is that if if people start becoming having chronic illness and
sw4109A-ms98-a-0021 123.106125 125.043500 and and things like that
sw4109A-ms98-a-0022 125.043500 134.305750 what happen[s]- and they where they have to spend out a lot of money for one particular it's called a a group well what'll what happens then is that 
sw4109A-ms98-a-0023 134.305750 138.611000 they cancel because they just can't cancel the [indivigal/individual]
sw4109A-ms98-a-0024 138.611000 143.363625 so that they have to cancel is just like life insurance they have to cancel everything
sw4109A-ms98-a-0025 143.363625 149.530500 so what they do is is that they they cancel the insurance and then all the people don't have any insurance coverage
sw4109A-ms98-a-0026 149.530500 153.302000 [silence]
sw4109A-ms98-a-0027 153.302000 161.136375 but i'm i'm you know i'm i'm satisfied with my job i'm i'm an engineering student and i work for my instructor and i'm
sw4109A-ms98-a-0028 161.136375 168.828375 i'm not a typical student i'm i'm older i'm i'm in my thirties okay and so i have a lot of job experience and
sw4109A-ms98-a-0029 168.828375 181.157500 my instructor thrives on that because he can just tell me what he wants and he can give me access and tell me what to do and just turn me loose but in the in the same token
sw4109A-ms98-a-0030 181.157500 187.765000 it's a really really enjoyable for me because_1 i don't have to have you know nobody breathing down my back and
sw4109A-ms98-a-0031 187.765000 194.286125 one of the things that i- i really hate about jobs i don't i don't like bosses that that you know wanna
sw4109A-ms98-a-0032 194.286125 195.569250 [silence]
sw4109A-ms98-a-0033 195.569250 202.649750 yell at you and you know and are are down your back and all this and that i- i just really can't deal with that so
sw4109A-ms98-a-0034 202.649750 206.000000 what kind of what kind of jobs have you done
sw4109A-ms98-a-0035 206.000000 210.170375 [silence]
sw4109A-ms98-a-0036 210.170375 211.793625 uh-huh
sw4109A-ms98-a-0037 211.793625 243.895125 [silence]
sw4109A-ms98-a-0038 243.895125 250.981125 yeah that's great you have what you might call knowledge power you know whe[n]- when you work at a company
sw4109A-ms98-a-0039 250.981125 264.867500 whether you know it or not is that you're categorized some people can be let go and replaced like uh say uh a a typist uh somebody who does data entry or answers the telephone a receptionist
sw4109A-ms98-a-0040 264.867500 278.229875 but if you're a person that's doing computer type things and you have the you have the knowledge you know what the system you've revised and revamped the system well then you're you're vital to the company and you get more of the benefits so
sw4109A-ms98-a-0041 278.229875 286.355500 that's where i'm tha[t]- i'm i like i'm into computers too and that's one of the things that i've found in in any o[ne]- one of these jobs and anything i've done 
sw4109A-ms98-a-0042 286.355500 294.996125 is that to have knowledge when you have the knowledge you're you're not gonna um you know be let go you know be one of the last ones to let go anyway
sw4109A-ms98-a-0043 294.996125 296.985875 [silence]
sw4109A-ms98-a-0044 296.985875 298.156125 but what i
