sw4104B-ms98-a-0017 64.565875 69.361125 so far we are in the clear credit wise but uh the other side of it is
sw4104B-ms98-a-0018 69.361125 70.563875 so
sw4104B-ms98-a-0019 70.563875 77.164625 not much on that side of it [laughter] to add to it we're trying to think of how to put away some savings
sw4104B-ms98-a-0020 77.164625 79.380250 and stuff like that but
sw4104B-ms98-a-0021 79.380250 80.934250 [silence]
sw4104B-ms98-a-0022 80.934250 84.638500 yeah we'd like to do that some day we have this dream
sw4104B-ms98-a-0023 84.638500 88.791125 but we don't know how long it will be a dream
sw4104B-ms98-a-0024 88.791125 93.345250 we we're kind of real we're really happy that we don't have any debt
sw4104B-ms98-a-0025 93.345250 98.508500 but we're at the same time we're real scared about incurring it in this um
sw4104B-ms98-a-0026 98.508500 99.537250 [silence]
sw4104B-ms98-a-0027 99.537250 110.013000 economy right now so we're stepping real careful and trying to see what's the best way to save what the little bit that we do get you know on top of expenses every month
sw4104B-ms98-a-0028 110.013000 111.913250 [silence]
sw4104B-ms98-a-0029 111.913250 115.388125 we're missionaries actually yeah uh-huh
sw4104B-ms98-a-0030 115.388125 123.693625 and um it will be easier once we get overseas cause we have uh like uh uh support quota
sw4104B-ms98-a-0031 123.693625 127.005625 and it's cheaper to live overseas than it is to live here
sw4104B-ms98-a-0032 127.005625 131.500625 and it doesn't get switched very easily once you come home
sw4104B-ms98-a-0033 131.500625 132.996500 so

sw4104B-ms98-a-0047 181.523875 189.229500 came home and got married and we will go ba[ck]- back as translators cause we want to raise a family and it is easier to raise a family
sw4104B-ms98-a-0048 189.229500 193.056125 as translators well i always wanted to do translation
sw4104B-ms98-a-0049 193.056125 200.487000 but as long as i was single and footloose so to speak it's easier you know they really need surveyors cause you could
sw4104B-ms98-a-0050 200.487000 204.648625 you're free to travel anywhere you don't have kids hanging around you and stuff

sw4104B-ms98-a-0052 210.546750 221.044750 well i have a smattering of about ten different ones but there's i'm not bilingual in any of them because i kept switching from one area to the other you know since i did
sw4104B-ms98-a-0053 221.044750 226.054000 you know complete a survey in one area i'd switch to the other so i know the greetings in about ten
sw4104B-ms98-a-0054 226.054000 229.630875 and how to do market stuff but in about
sw4104B-ms98-a-0055 229.630875 241.566875 um about five i guess i can do better in it and my French is pretty good but it's uh Senegalese French so uh i'm terrified to speak it in um 
sw4104B-ms98-a-0056 241.566875 248.017125 in France yeah because they're real snobby about their language and Senegalese French is street French and
sw4104B-ms98-a-0057 248.017125 257.635125 i just picked it up off the street and i knew what i was i knew what i was communicating but i didn't know what i was saying i never sat there and got a direct translation and
sw4104B-ms98-a-0058 257.635125 264.917750 said something here when i came home and French to somebody and he paled and said i'm not going to tell you what you said so
sw4104B-ms98-a-0059 264.917750 271.648000 since then i have refrained from speaking any French [laughter] except in Senegal [laughter]
sw4104B-ms98-a-0060 271.648000 275.581875 i don't know what i said to him but uh i didn't ask him either
