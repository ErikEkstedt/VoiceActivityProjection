sw4108A-ms98-a-0051 185.891750 191.537250 and she really liked the idea of of moving there she's not ill yet
sw4108A-ms98-a-0052 191.537250 196.991250 but um she worked there as a volunteer for about ten years
sw4108A-ms98-a-0053 196.991250 205.581750 and then she decided that um she's eighty five years old that eventually you know she she doesn't want her family taking care of her
sw4108A-ms98-a-0054 205.581750 207.990250 and being a burden she's very independent
sw4108A-ms98-a-0055 207.990250 211.117750 so she's in this nursing home it's out in the country
sw4108A-ms98-a-0056 211.117750 215.531750 and um she really enjoys it right now
sw4108A-ms98-a-0057 215.531750 219.743500 [noise] because she doesn't have to wash dishes or [laughter-cook]

sw4108A-ms98-a-0061 229.987375 231.379500 and
sw4108A-ms98-a-0062 231.379500 237.054250 what i like about it and i think she likes about it is that she knows everybody there now
sw4108A-ms98-a-0063 237.054250 240.195875 and then so if she ever does become ill
sw4108A-ms98-a-0064 240.195875 243.233375 um it'll be like family around her
sw4108A-ms98-a-0065 243.233375 244.527250 yeah
