sw4108B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.235000 [noise] okay
sw4108B-ms98-a-0002 1.235000 7.029375 [silence]
sw4108B-ms98-a-0003 7.029375 11.425125 well i think that it it varies on on the individual basis
sw4108B-ms98-a-0004 11.425125 19.339375 uh sometimes it is there's no alternative uh you do not have uh
sw4108B-ms98-a-0005 19.339375 26.918625 uh family available or family that's uh you may not even have family that is uh [noise]
sw4108B-ms98-a-0006 26.918625 29.692250 in and who around
sw4108B-ms98-a-0007 29.692250 42.542125 so sometimes it's not an alternative and i think uh but i think also sometimes it can be uh a benefit if it's for a short time sometimes in a nursing home
sw4108B-ms98-a-0008 42.542125 51.050625 um especially after if it's after an acute illness to get over a uh or to rehab after uh an illness
sw4108B-ms98-a-0009 51.050625 58.830625 sometimes you know it sometimes the nursing homes are good for uh just short periods of time
sw4108B-ms98-a-0010 58.830625 60.144625 [silence]
sw4108B-ms98-a-0011 60.144625 69.480625 um-hum because too often the acute hospitals will are sending them_1 out much faster than what they're really able to
sw4108B-ms98-a-0012 69.480625 80.354625 but so so there is some good to it uh sometimes too it's used as a dumb job you know the fam[ilies]- well the families do not necessarily
sw4108B-ms98-a-0013 80.354625 86.476000 uh know what to do with them_1 and they don't wanna take the responsibility so they will put them_1 in a nursing home
sw4108B-ms98-a-0014 86.476000 91.938125 so you see uh there's both sides to it too what do you think
sw4108B-ms98-a-0015 91.938125 99.299375 [silence]
sw4108B-ms98-a-0016 99.299375 100.427125 yeah
sw4108B-ms98-a-0017 100.427125 111.375125 [silence]
sw4108B-ms98-a-0018 111.375125 112.982125 that's true
sw4108B-ms98-a-0019 112.982125 119.010375 [silence]
sw4108B-ms98-a-0020 119.010375 128.393000 well i think that's also where you're gonna to have a lot of people who are going to it's there's not a choice it's because_1 there it's not economically feasible even to put them_1 in a nursing home 
sw4108B-ms98-a-0021 128.393000 135.135000 [noise] so that that option sometimes is not available if they do not have the uh either Medicare or insurance to cover it
sw4108B-ms98-a-0022 135.135000 136.678250 so
sw4108B-ms98-a-0023 136.678250 143.218750 [silence]
sw4108B-ms98-a-0024 143.218750 147.808375 yeah and then there's also some that are set up for specialties uh
sw4108B-ms98-a-0025 147.808375 153.691750 [noise] i know some el[derly]- unfortunately some elderly have to go to or [noise] have
sw4108B-ms98-a-0026 153.691750 158.542875 i guess it's Alzheimer's or where they wander or or um
sw4108B-ms98-a-0027 158.542875 159.631875 [silence]
sw4108B-ms98-a-0028 159.631875 162.422500 confused or have some mental problems
sw4108B-ms98-a-0029 162.422500 172.496500 and you need a special nursing home for that you need one that has a unit that's locked where they are not able to get out and roam around and you need people who are trained for that type of problem
sw4108B-ms98-a-0030 172.496500 177.156000 yeah so so there's different types of nursing homes i think
sw4108B-ms98-a-0031 177.156000 190.939250 [silence]
sw4108B-ms98-a-0032 190.939250 192.167250 um-hum
sw4108B-ms98-a-0033 192.167250 218.784875 [silence]
sw4108B-ms98-a-0034 218.784875 224.511500 gives her a little bit of her own independence but she still has uh a security there
sw4108B-ms98-a-0035 224.511500 242.603375 [silence]
sw4108B-ms98-a-0036 242.603375 250.529375 that's right and i i've seen some of them like that too and also they have a lot of uh activities going on for the ones who are more active
sw4108B-ms98-a-0037 250.529375 254.625000 so it's not sort of like uh uh a sick place [noise]
sw4108B-ms98-a-0038 254.625000 268.136000 [silence]
sw4108B-ms98-a-0039 268.136000 272.146500 yeah i think i think of the um
sw4108B-ms98-a-0040 272.146500 283.199250 i think the the decision that needs to be made though on nursing home has to be a joint one between the the uh elderly uh person who's going in
sw4108B-ms98-a-0041 283.199250 288.271125 and the family that's going to be uh effec[ted]- effected by it [noise]
sw4108B-ms98-a-0042 288.271125 298.306000 [noise] and uh you know sometimes it can those choi[ces]- those choices can be made in advance and sometimes the choices uh because of the nature of the illness when they're
