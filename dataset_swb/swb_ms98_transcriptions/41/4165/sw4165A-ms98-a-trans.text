sw4165A-ms98-a-0012 42.473000 48.646875 [silence]
sw4165A-ms98-a-0013 48.646875 54.572875 uh-huh well uh we're kind of lucky i i'm uh
sw4165A-ms98-a-0014 54.572875 68.537625 i'm working my wife isn't working and she is taking care of the kids also and and so we haven't had to look for child care either which has been very nice but i do have like you mentioned a lot of friends a lot of uh coworkers and associates that are looking
sw4165A-ms98-a-0015 68.537625 79.184375 for child care and some of the things that they're very critical about is the number of kids that are in the child care uh what kind of you know
sw4165A-ms98-a-0016 79.184375 84.189750 uh guidance counselor to student or you know
sw4165A-ms98-a-0017 84.189750 90.916250 uh adult to child relationship how many you know you don't want to have thirty or [laughter-forty] kids and only one adult 
sw4165A-ms98-a-0018 90.916250 98.148750 then uh something happens and the adult wouldn't be able to uh accommodate or take care of the kids very well and uh
sw4165A-ms98-a-0019 98.148750 108.314750 they also want to make sure that the kids are being taught not just playing around all the time so you know depends also upon the the level of the child we uh 
sw4165A-ms98-a-0020 108.314750 119.316125 we uh take a very close look at finding a a preschool a good preschool for our kid and i kind of relate that to that in in making sure that the
sw4165A-ms98-a-0021 119.316125 131.131000 the uh teachers are very well educated themselves they have a good curriculum and that they're willing to teach the kids and have a fun time with them and it's very important i feel 
sw4165A-ms98-a-0022 131.131000 142.494500 uh that the kids interact with other children also it's a it's a good way to develop yeah relationships with other kids their age and uh get to know and work with kids 
sw4165A-ms98-a-0023 142.494500 150.421500 so i don't know i i guess we're kind of in the same boat we haven't had to look very carefully for child care
sw4165A-ms98-a-0024 150.421500 160.501375 [silence]

sw4165A-ms98-a-0037 223.000125 230.729125 i think it's uh important like you mentioned that's a good idea on the uh parent co-op because uh
sw4165A-ms98-a-0038 230.729125 239.390750 [noise] i'm very concerned about the welfare of my kids and i don't want to just take them to somebody i pick out of the yellow pages or out of some ad somewhere i want to trust the people
sw4165A-ms98-a-0039 239.390750 248.307875 [noise] and uh you know you hear in the newspa[per]- you hear on the T V and you read the newspaper quite often of of people that you know
sw4165A-ms98-a-0040 248.307875 254.502875 don't treat or take care of your kids the way you think they ought to be taken care of so and
sw4165A-ms98-a-0041 254.502875 265.913875 hope to never get into that situation where we have to have to find somebody and we have to trust someone with the welfare of our children and hope that we can stay in this [laughter-situation] for awhile so
