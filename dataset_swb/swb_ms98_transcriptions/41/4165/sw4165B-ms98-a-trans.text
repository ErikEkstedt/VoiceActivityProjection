sw4165B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 8.965250 [noise]
sw4165B-ms98-a-0002 8.965250 22.255875 well ourselves we have i guess never had to look for child care our kids are now fourteen and eighteen but uh [noise] and so you know you go back
sw4165B-ms98-a-0003 22.255875 33.944625 those many years and uh we didn't do it very much and we i guess we were in a situation where we didn't need to be looking at uh two family income at the time 
sw4165B-ms98-a-0004 33.944625 41.998000 and our kids were older but i've had to deal with uh you know friends of ours that have used child care and that kind of thing
sw4165B-ms98-a-0005 41.998000 50.652875 uh so it my involvement hasn't been direct but still have been you know certainly exposed to criteria people are using how about yourself
sw4165B-ms98-a-0006 50.652875 85.889250 [silence]
sw4165B-ms98-a-0007 85.889250 87.548750 right
sw4165B-ms98-a-0008 87.548750 90.722125 [silence]
sw4165B-ms98-a-0009 90.722125 91.978000 right
sw4165B-ms98-a-0010 91.978000 96.853000 [silence]
sw4165B-ms98-a-0011 96.853000 98.122125 well
sw4165B-ms98-a-0012 98.122125 114.337750 [silence]
sw4165B-ms98-a-0013 114.337750 115.875000 uh-huh
sw4165B-ms98-a-0014 115.875000 148.813000 [silence]
sw4165B-ms98-a-0015 148.813000 153.465000 yeah i [noise] i kind of think that uh
sw4165B-ms98-a-0016 153.465000 164.666875 you know some of our friends or even our own children will be in a situation where they may need to look for child care but even you know here i guess we have
sw4165B-ms98-a-0017 164.666875 171.756875 in [vocalized-noise] one sense two forms of uh child care there's where individuals will 
sw4165B-ms98-a-0018 171.756875 181.287250 [noise] in one [vocalized-noise] primarily babysit children in their own home and that will be groups of anywhere from one or two to maybe seven or eight children 
sw4165B-ms98-a-0019 181.287250 193.192250 and then otherwise there will be [noise] the majority are cooperative day cares uh people form a co-op and uh parents will work in the co-op and put a fair number of hours
sw4165B-ms98-a-0020 193.192250 198.765250 frequently they will hire staff to be at the day care and
sw4165B-ms98-a-0021 198.765250 211.719750 [noise] the emphasis is primarily uh someplace for the children to be but at the same time there's some [vocalized-noise] fairly good training programs 
sw4165B-ms98-a-0022 211.719750 215.512000 and and some of them formal two year programs
sw4165B-ms98-a-0023 215.512000 223.309125 uh so that you know there is some definite uh creative play good social interaction that kind of thing
sw4165B-ms98-a-0024 223.309125 238.696125 [silence]
sw4165B-ms98-a-0025 238.696125 240.184500 [noise] yeah
sw4165B-ms98-a-0026 240.184500 264.849500 [silence]
sw4165B-ms98-a-0027 264.849500 273.081250 yeah [noise] you know we've even had some of those kinds of situations publicized here and [noise] i guess
sw4165B-ms98-a-0028 273.081250 280.353375 you know it are it's uh typically uh whether it's been child care in a home
sw4165B-ms98-a-0029 280.353375 289.800000 [noise] or in a larger situation where actually it's more of an institution and you've actually got children that most people would consider problem children and it's not
sw4165B-ms98-a-0030 289.800000 298.226250 and it's more of a group home rather than actually day care [vocalized-noise] type of facility uh 
sw4165B-ms98-a-0031 298.226250 299.330000 so
