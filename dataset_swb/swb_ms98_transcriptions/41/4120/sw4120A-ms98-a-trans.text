sw4120A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.902250 ever um
sw4120A-ms98-a-0002 1.902250 3.557875 hello
sw4120A-ms98-a-0003 3.557875 8.155750 yeah okay so we're started i guess i'll p[ress]- press one again [noise]
sw4120A-ms98-a-0004 8.155750 9.529500 there
sw4120A-ms98-a-0005 9.529500 14.121125 uh i'm surprised it's not telling us that that uh
sw4120A-ms98-a-0006 14.121125 22.582000 we're going but at any rate um had do you have such a program uh where you work
sw4120A-ms98-a-0007 22.582000 35.415375 [silence]
sw4120A-ms98-a-0008 35.415375 43.042500 well i'll tell you the truth when it uh when it was introduced to Texas Instruments it was a lot of hard feeling now my initial reaction was
sw4120A-ms98-a-0009 43.042500 50.297625 benign i uh really didn't feel as a matter of fact i was sort of sympathetic in the sense that uh
sw4120A-ms98-a-0010 50.297625 55.450000 uh you know we we want to stamp out um drug use
sw4120A-ms98-a-0011 55.450000 60.940625 uh and uh the it's certainly no good for the company to have employees who are on drugs
sw4120A-ms98-a-0012 60.940625 62.624625 um
sw4120A-ms98-a-0013 62.624625 72.598250 and i don't really consider it uh an invasion of privacy uh in the se[nse]- because uh drug use is
sw4120A-ms98-a-0014 72.598250 79.989375 uh a dangerous influence on other people in society
sw4120A-ms98-a-0015 79.989375 87.691875 um there wa[s]- i was in with a group of fuzzy heads however who um
sw4120A-ms98-a-0016 87.691875 93.789125 were rabidly opposed to it and i i gradually became 
sw4120A-ms98-a-0017 93.789125 105.051250 proselytized uh by this group and the to me the big sensitive thing is well there there're couple things one is the is the insult of it
sw4120A-ms98-a-0018 105.051250 107.678250 perhaps as a um
sw4120A-ms98-a-0019 107.678250 113.807125 preemployment test is one thing but to come in post facto and say to
sw4120A-ms98-a-0020 113.807125 122.258125 uh employees who are tried and proven uh that they've been asked to do they're gonna have to submit to drug test is sort of a slap in the face
sw4120A-ms98-a-0021 122.258125 151.950625 [silence]
sw4120A-ms98-a-0022 151.950625 155.662625 and of course there're problems with doing that you realize because
sw4120A-ms98-a-0023 155.662625 166.724375 uh this requires a very strong minded management and uh uh a supervisory it requires the supervisor to be brass balled i[n]- in a sense
sw4120A-ms98-a-0024 166.724375 176.004500 to go to a an employee who appears to possibly be under the influence of drugs and say [noise] you've got to take a drug test
sw4120A-ms98-a-0025 176.004500 177.766125 [silence]
sw4120A-ms98-a-0026 177.766125 181.489000 uh as opposed to just randomly requiring it of everyone 
sw4120A-ms98-a-0027 181.489000 209.121500 [silence]
sw4120A-ms98-a-0028 209.121500 210.368375 um-hum
sw4120A-ms98-a-0029 210.368375 211.586875 [silence]
sw4120A-ms98-a-0030 211.586875 212.867750 right
sw4120A-ms98-a-0031 212.867750 224.350375 [silence]
sw4120A-ms98-a-0032 224.350375 227.996250 was that on a nee[d]- on a need basis or [laughter]
sw4120A-ms98-a-0033 227.996250 230.085750 [silence]
sw4120A-ms98-a-0034 230.085750 231.990750 oh i see all right
sw4120A-ms98-a-0035 231.990750 249.671250 [silence]
sw4120A-ms98-a-0036 249.671250 259.266375 uh right um i guess the other objection that i was exposed to at Texas Instruments was the um
sw4120A-ms98-a-0037 259.266375 260.657250 [silence]
sw4120A-ms98-a-0038 260.657250 264.944875 u[nproductive]- unproductive nature of it that basically uh
sw4120A-ms98-a-0039 264.944875 275.557875 drugs is not a problem at Texas Instruments and the corporation i think are going through this exercise mainly to remain in the good graces of their customer the government
sw4120A-ms98-a-0040 275.557875 285.942750 uh rather than to improve their productivity by stamping out drug use because the the likelihood of finding drug users in the TI population is very very low
sw4120A-ms98-a-0041 285.942750 286.999750 [silence]
sw4120A-ms98-a-0042 286.999750 290.352625 and um and so
sw4120A-ms98-a-0043 290.352625 299.074000 uh people saw it as actually sort of a passing on of the the testing uh requirement from the government
