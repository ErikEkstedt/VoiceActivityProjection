sw4112B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.465750 [noise] right now i'm at um
sw4112B-ms98-a-0002 1.465750 4.528875 University of Pennsylvania i'm a graduate student
sw4112B-ms98-a-0003 4.528875 9.068500 and the benefits that i get are very minimal
sw4112B-ms98-a-0004 9.068500 16.606000 but i do get my health insurance paid for but i don't have any kind of disability insurance or um
sw4112B-ms98-a-0005 16.606000 23.407375 let's see no disability insurance no va[cation]- well i ge[t]- in a way i get vacation pay because i get to se[t]- totally set my own schedule
sw4112B-ms98-a-0006 23.407375 25.044875 but
sw4112B-ms98-a-0007 25.044875 29.990625 not any real significant benefits my health insurance is very minimal
sw4112B-ms98-a-0008 29.990625 33.808000 [silence]
sw4112B-ms98-a-0009 33.808000 35.098125 uh-huh
sw4112B-ms98-a-0010 35.098125 41.504500 [silence]
sw4112B-ms98-a-0011 41.504500 44.634125 you're undergraduate student or graduate student
sw4112B-ms98-a-0012 44.634125 46.293500 undergrad yeah
sw4112B-ms98-a-0013 46.293500 49.496375 yeah here they for the grad students at least
sw4112B-ms98-a-0014 49.496375 59.979500 in physiology department which my de[gree]- degree granting department is bio[logical]- engineering but physiology and the biomedical departments at least pay the health insurance engineering doesn't even do that
sw4112B-ms98-a-0015 59.979500 69.846250 but i don't know i think that it would be great if instead of having health insurance and all those things tied to a job the way they are now
sw4112B-ms98-a-0016 69.846250 80.101750 so that some people can get them and some people can't and it's like having two classes of income some that is taxed and some that is not it'd be great if they had
sw4112B-ms98-a-0017 80.101750 83.749750 everybody responsible for their own health insurance
sw4112B-ms98-a-0018 83.749750 86.888375 and either that or wh[at]-
sw4112B-ms98-a-0019 86.888375 93.309500 they could be responsible for their own health insurance but if they did take the company benefit then that would be taxed like other income
sw4112B-ms98-a-0020 93.309500 105.249625 so then that would everybody would know what their real income was and that their benefit that they were getting from the company was costing them something and that they might want to look around to get something better somewhere else
sw4112B-ms98-a-0021 105.249625 108.568375 [silence]
sw4112B-ms98-a-0022 108.568375 110.563000 so
sw4112B-ms98-a-0023 110.563000 111.710500 i guess
sw4112B-ms98-a-0024 111.710500 114.936250 i would like to see something like that and then
sw4112B-ms98-a-0025 114.936250 120.587750 i guess the going beyond just the idea of benefits having
sw4112B-ms98-a-0026 120.587750 125.085125 instead of um a national health insurance system having
sw4112B-ms98-a-0027 125.085125 136.260000 a sort of like an FDIC for health insurers so if if you're health insurance company goes out of business you don't lose everything if you get sick
sw4112B-ms98-a-0028 136.260000 141.564875 [silence]
sw4112B-ms98-a-0029 141.564875 147.573875 but on the other hand i[n]- in the curr[ent]- state of the current system i'll
sw4112B-ms98-a-0030 147.573875 151.192750 whenever i get out of here i'll look for
sw4112B-ms98-a-0031 151.192750 154.267000 a job probably an academic job that would
sw4112B-ms98-a-0032 154.267000 156.398375 [silence]
sw4112B-ms98-a-0033 156.398375 164.292500 you know benefits i don't know how important that'll be usually academic jobs you get TIAA for your retirement plan
sw4112B-ms98-a-0034 164.292500 172.264125 which is a it's a mutual fund that allows you to transfer your benefits with you with whatever job you go to
sw4112B-ms98-a-0035 172.264125 174.403000 and
sw4112B-ms98-a-0036 174.403000 176.051750 [silence]
sw4112B-ms98-a-0037 176.051750 186.172125 a lot of an academic jobs give you that but on the other hand state retirement if you work for a state university can be very secure in taking [noise] good care of you
sw4112B-ms98-a-0038 186.172125 189.225250 i know my daddy worked for the federal government
sw4112B-ms98-a-0039 189.225250 200.062875 and he was in the soil conservation service and then after he retired from that he w[ent]- taught school for a while and he had taught school early in his career so he got the
sw4112B-ms98-a-0040 200.062875 211.542250 federal retiree benefits and the state retiree benefits and the most important for him has been the health insurance because my mama isn't particularly well
sw4112B-ms98-a-0041 211.542250 217.057250 she has um she's a kidney patient on dialysis and he was saying that
sw4112B-ms98-a-0042 217.057250 226.385500 now that her kidneys have totally failed they've taken her off one of the drugs Lasix which is a diuretic it it changes how the kidneys absorb moisture
sw4112B-ms98-a-0043 226.385500 231.508250 and her drug bill is now down to two hundred dollars a month [laughter]
sw4112B-ms98-a-0044 231.508250 241.447750 so and that's the lowest it's been in quite some time and so health insurance can be a real big important thing to get
sw4112B-ms98-a-0045 241.447750 242.495250 [silence]
sw4112B-ms98-a-0046 242.495250 245.955625 what kind of job are you thinking about getting when you get out
