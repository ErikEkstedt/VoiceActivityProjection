sw4127A-ms98-a-0022 93.040125 94.641875 straightforward
sw4127A-ms98-a-0023 94.641875 99.198250 it's almo[st]- i can't imagine having to go into real complicated stuff and making
sw4127A-ms98-a-0024 99.198250 105.695875 you know fancy budgets it seems like if you're getting to that level y[ou're]- you're not in real good control

sw4127A-ms98-a-0030 122.642250 130.291500 because that way it's a record of everything and i don't have to worry about keeping [laughter-records] of anything else because they come in at the end of the month

sw4127A-ms98-a-0051 206.570250 211.505500 it seems like it's absurd the number of people who had to having to pay somebody to do it

sw4127A-ms98-a-0065 251.895250 261.248375 on top of the numbers and understand what's going on i know too many people who use a calculator if they make a mistake they find out two months later because they weren't paying attention
