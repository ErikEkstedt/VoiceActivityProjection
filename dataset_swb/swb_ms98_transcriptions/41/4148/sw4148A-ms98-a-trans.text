sw4148A-ms98-a-0002 0.319000 1.373375 [silence]
sw4148A-ms98-a-0003 1.373375 4.722750 okay so um 
sw4148A-ms98-a-0004 4.722750 16.602250 with the issue of trial by jury um i actually found the whole question about whether you need a a unan[imous]- a unanimous verdict in a criminal case to be somewhat interesting 
sw4148A-ms98-a-0005 16.602250 30.409500 [silence]
sw4148A-ms98-a-0006 30.409500 43.843625 i don't know if it's even true that it's always unanimous because_1 i thought there were cases where uh i don't know if it's the difference between felonies and misdemeanors but where it was okay for a state to have it like eleven out of twelve 
sw4148A-ms98-a-0007 43.843625 47.388875 [silence]
sw4148A-ms98-a-0008 47.388875 48.334875 yeah
sw4148A-ms98-a-0009 48.334875 70.422750 [silence]
sw4148A-ms98-a-0010 70.422750 77.295750 well i'd be curious as to what the um requirement for a an acquittal is 
sw4148A-ms98-a-0011 77.295750 91.863375 i mean i- i don't think it would be wrong to say that eleven out of twelve can convict if there were something corresponding saying that if you know six or seven voted not guilty then instead of it being a hung jury that was an acquittal 
sw4148A-ms98-a-0012 91.863375 97.513750 but i don't know whether you need an [anani[mous]-/unanimous] a unanimous uh vote of not guilty to acquit 
sw4148A-ms98-a-0013 97.513750 133.605000 [silence]
sw4148A-ms98-a-0014 133.605000 136.612375 [noise]
sw4148A-ms98-a-0015 136.612375 144.613125 yeah i'd agree with that but i've never had the the opportunity to serve on a jury although i've been out here and registered for i guess about five years 
sw4148A-ms98-a-0016 144.613125 145.678625 but
sw4148A-ms98-a-0017 145.678625 157.586500 [silence]
sw4148A-ms98-a-0018 157.586500 158.735500 oh
sw4148A-ms98-a-0019 158.735500 167.734000 [silence]
sw4148A-ms98-a-0020 167.734000 172.255125 well the people i know who've served have said that usually what ends up happening 
sw4148A-ms98-a-0021 172.255125 176.834250 is that you know after initially finding out where people stand
sw4148A-ms98-a-0022 176.834250 190.678375 that the whole deliberation usually results if there is a you know something like a nine three or or more severe and and the people in the majority trying to convince the minority that they're right 
sw4148A-ms98-a-0023 190.678375 194.750125 and in fact i'm not sure that that's anymore 
sw4148A-ms98-a-0024 194.750125 199.267625 uh liable to get rid of the reasonable doubt 
sw4148A-ms98-a-0025 199.267625 201.578500 than than anything else 
sw4148A-ms98-a-0026 201.578500 214.880000 [silence]
sw4148A-ms98-a-0027 214.880000 215.990000 um-hum 
sw4148A-ms98-a-0028 215.990000 229.858625 [silence]
sw4148A-ms98-a-0029 229.858625 238.148000 yeah i'd read one book i think it was called Trial by Jury of [laughter-all] [laughter-things] that uh went through and interviewed a bunch of jurors in some of the big cases 
sw4148A-ms98-a-0030 238.148000 251.009250 and in many cases looking at what had ha[ppened]- at the evidence afterwards as to whether the decision was right went back to the jurors uh based on the deliberations some of them did say that you know when they were the only one left opposing 
sw4148A-ms98-a-0031 251.009250 253.150375 the verdict uh
sw4148A-ms98-a-0032 253.150375 257.890500 you know everyone was getting on them so so heavily that eventually they just gave in 
sw4148A-ms98-a-0033 257.890500 265.109125 knowing that nothing they could do could stop it from either being the verdict everyone else was trying for or a hung jury
sw4148A-ms98-a-0034 265.109125 270.153000 because the one vote doesn't mean anything except the ability to not have a verdict
sw4148A-ms98-a-0035 270.153000 284.620125 [silence]
sw4148A-ms98-a-0036 284.620125 285.919625 um-hum 
sw4148A-ms98-a-0037 285.919625 287.490375 yeah once
sw4148A-ms98-a-0038 287.490375 299.714000 [silence]
