sw4148B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.070000 [noise] hi
sw4148B-ms98-a-0002 1.070000 16.502500 [silence]
sw4148B-ms98-a-0003 16.502500 30.877250 yeah actually i a[gree]- i agree that [noise] that's an interesting thing i i believe that's a for for civil suits it's not unanimous right but for for criminal suits it's unanimous by federal law 
sw4148B-ms98-a-0004 30.877250 43.758750 [silence]
sw4148B-ms98-a-0005 43.758750 53.179500 yeah i actually thought i'd read that too and that's why i phrased it that way i wonder the difference yeah the difference could be that for um state 
sw4148B-ms98-a-0006 53.179500 64.015250 if there is such a thing state felonies versus federal felonies that federal things that are under federal jurisdiction require the unanimous vote and things that are under state jurisdiction even criminal don't require 
sw4148B-ms98-a-0007 64.015250 71.041125 but i don't know what the the laws do you think that that's an unreasonable um requirement that they be unanimous 
sw4148B-ms98-a-0008 71.041125 97.782750 [silence]
sw4148B-ms98-a-0009 97.782750 109.541375 yeah that that would be an interesting change it would also allow i[dea]- the um idea that if you had one person who was um very disagreeable 
sw4148B-ms98-a-0010 109.541375 116.265000 that i mean i[t]- it fundamentally changes the way the processing occurs because um 
sw4148B-ms98-a-0011 116.265000 127.410375 the fact that it's [noise] well the the principle is that the fact that it's unanimous insures the beyond a reasonable doubt um criterion that it um 
sw4148B-ms98-a-0012 127.410375 136.589125 increases the the likelihood of getting the proper judgment so i i think if anything it would have to be a very close to unanimous decision 
sw4148B-ms98-a-0013 136.589125 144.153000 [silence]
sw4148B-ms98-a-0014 144.153000 158.094000 yeah actually i- i thought that that would be very interesting thing to do i would like to do that i've been out here twenty some years and i've been called um three different times but i've never actually even made it into the the jury box 
sw4148B-ms98-a-0015 158.094000 164.378500 and because_1 there have always been a number of people and and i've never gotten up there to answer any of the questions 
sw4148B-ms98-a-0016 164.378500 168.500625 um i yeah i also think that would be really good uh 
sw4148B-ms98-a-0017 168.500625 190.451750 [silence]
sw4148B-ms98-a-0018 190.451750 191.674250 um-hum 
sw4148B-ms98-a-0019 191.674250 201.676375 [silence]
sw4148B-ms98-a-0020 201.676375 205.836250 well the o[ne]- the one thing that i know does seem to happen i[s]- 
sw4148B-ms98-a-0021 205.836250 215.223375 from people i've talked to on this is that in the situation you just said where it's nine to three or some such number that there's an effect starts being that there's a lot of peer pressure 
sw4148B-ms98-a-0022 215.223375 229.832000 going on and that that um peer pressure and in some cases if it's a long trial the desire of people to get out of there and not be stuck in there for a very long time that people are changing their minds for the wrong reasons 
sw4148B-ms98-a-0023 229.832000 231.163375 um 
sw4148B-ms98-a-0024 231.163375 233.192250 [silence]
sw4148B-ms98-a-0025 233.192250 234.259625 um-hum 
sw4148B-ms98-a-0026 234.259625 269.733625 [silence]
sw4148B-ms98-a-0027 269.733625 277.347625 yeah i i understand you you would hope that if you were in that situation that you'd have the moral fortitude um 
sw4148B-ms98-a-0028 277.347625 286.409750 to hold out if you believed that that was really the proper response i think of the movie um Twelve Angry Men you ever seen that movie 
sw4148B-ms98-a-0029 286.409750 299.714000 uh yeah it's it's it's exactly that situation where uh it's Henry Fonda and it's eleven to one and he's the one i- i believe he was opposed to the conviction and uh and he held on and
