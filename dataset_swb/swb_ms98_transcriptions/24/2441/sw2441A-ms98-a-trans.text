sw2441A-ms98-a-0031 130.635125 141.826750 absolutely all these all the all this money that we're throwing away to pay people to go out and do things when we're paying all these welfare recipients and if they're able-bodied people
sw2441A-ms98-a-0032 141.826750 152.679875 i don't see any problem at all having them_1 go out there and and if nothing else get a group of them_1 together and take them_1 around to old folks places and let them_1 cut the yards and paint the houses 
sw2441A-ms98-a-0033 152.679875 157.457500 sure sure so[me]- i mean get something out of that money
sw2441A-ms98-a-0034 157.457500 169.434625 yeah i- i- i my next door neighbor when i was growing up worked for the unemployment division and his sole job was just tracking down people who were getting benefits and able-bodied and
sw2441A-ms98-a-0035 169.434625 173.062250 yeah and he he had all kinds of horror stories
sw2441A-ms98-a-0036 173.062250 186.811875 you know these guys go down there and get their unemployment checks and back back in those days they also used to give you a uh booklets good for uh clothing and gas and things like this and they'd get all this stuff together and sit down and have poker games
sw2441A-ms98-a-0037 186.811875 192.174625 you know and i'm i [laughter-ju[st]-] i have a hard time dealing with that
sw2441A-ms98-a-0038 192.174625 208.515125 [silence]
sw2441A-ms98-a-0039 208.515125 210.668625 um-hum
sw2441A-ms98-a-0040 210.668625 218.323750 yeah no i know i i[t]- you you you think about you think about the layer of bureaucracy between the money and the recipient
sw2441A-ms98-a-0041 218.323750 225.378500 and and there's there's probably there's easily probably six or seven times that amount being spent on the bureaucracy
sw2441A-ms98-a-0042 225.378500 235.064125 you know it's it's it's totally ridiculous i mean i i uh i uh started out when i first got in graduate school i was going into uh public administration
sw2441A-ms98-a-0043 235.064125 243.826250 and [laughter-i] quite honestly i just got so fed up with it i just couldn't stand it any[more]- yeah i mean this is the kind of thing you look at
sw2441A-ms98-a-0044 243.826250 256.278500 uh you sit there and when you're writing up budgets you wonder okay how much money do we need well you need X number dollars for the recipients but you need X number dollars to administer the program i'm going this is ridiculous
sw2441A-ms98-a-0045 256.278500 270.184625 this is ridiculous it is it's pathetic i mean there's got to be a different way there's got to be a better way but it'll never happen i mean these these people out here getting that money are are big voting blocks
sw2441A-ms98-a-0046 270.184625 277.516875 [silence]
sw2441A-ms98-a-0047 277.516875 288.884250 i think i think there ought to be some kind of assistance as far as uh and i would limit it strictly to something like t[uition]- uh tuition assistance uh give an incentive
sw2441A-ms98-a-0048 288.884250 293.633500 yeah someth[ing]- something that's gonna help them along the way

sw2441A-ms98-a-0052 304.461250 314.110625 or adults that is can't even read and and we've got the lowest rates of civilized countries in science and math
sw2441A-ms98-a-0053 314.110625 318.216625 i mean what are we what are we becoming we're becoming a service country
sw2441A-ms98-a-0054 318.216625 319.524125 [silence]
sw2441A-ms98-a-0055 319.524125 326.336875 yeah we were an industrial giant and now we're not we're not gonna do it because everybody is is beating us at the game
sw2441A-ms98-a-0056 326.336875 330.156625 we taught them how to do it and they they did it better than we do
sw2441A-ms98-a-0057 330.156625 333.990875 simple as that yeah it's simple as that
sw2441A-ms98-a-0058 333.990875 335.892125 [silence]
sw2441A-ms98-a-0059 335.892125 338.411875 yeah it's terrible for us

sw2441A-ms98-a-0064 354.911375 356.489000 you know
sw2441A-ms98-a-0065 356.489000 359.507625 [silence]
sw2441A-ms98-a-0066 359.507625 364.024375 yeah i know i know a[nd]-
sw2441A-ms98-a-0067 364.024375 368.590375 well you know you know you know why they do it is so they can get them_1 out of the house
sw2441A-ms98-a-0068 368.590375 373.013500 yeah th[at]- that that's my other complaint parents aren't parents anymore
sw2441A-ms98-a-0069 373.013500 374.716250 [silence]
sw2441A-ms98-a-0070 374.716250 379.658500 yeah one of the other subjects is do you think the public school systems are in trouble
sw2441A-ms98-a-0071 379.658500 384.406000 well as a substitute teacher for a year i can i can say yes [laughter]
sw2441A-ms98-a-0072 384.406000 396.492000 [silence]

sw2441A-ms98-a-0075 405.733125 407.891250 yeah
sw2441A-ms98-a-0076 407.891250 409.425250 hm um-hum
sw2441A-ms98-a-0077 409.425250 415.239750 [silence]

sw2441A-ms98-a-0079 416.807500 417.848500 [silence]
sw2441A-ms98-a-0080 417.848500 419.569375 exactly
sw2441A-ms98-a-0081 419.569375 422.529375 [silence]
sw2441A-ms98-a-0082 422.529375 427.020875 well in a way it is but y[ou]- but you have to look out for yourself
sw2441A-ms98-a-0083 427.020875 431.593000 you know i mean that's someth[ing]- b[ut]- and and when we pay garbage men more than we pay teachers
sw2441A-ms98-a-0084 431.593000 434.424625 [laughter-yeah] gosh i mean
sw2441A-ms98-a-0085 434.424625 436.053375 [silence]
sw2441A-ms98-a-0086 436.053375 444.949250 no i mean uh yeah they uh they do an absolutely necessary job i mean i i ad[mire]- i have a great deal of admiration for these people who can go out there and do that
sw2441A-ms98-a-0087 444.949250 455.785125 um but uh i mean there there's a there's a sense of priorities here too you know we need t[o]- what's more important picking up the garbage or educating our kids
sw2441A-ms98-a-0088 455.785125 458.251250 yeah they [vocalized-noise] sure
sw2441A-ms98-a-0089 458.251250 459.523375 [silence]
sw2441A-ms98-a-0090 459.523375 466.217125 i mean one's import[ant]- i mean on the other hand i mean you take a garbage man in New York City starts out at twenty six thousand dollars
sw2441A-ms98-a-0091 466.217125 472.324500 well i'll bet you there're a whole bunch of homeless people up there who would take that job for thirteen thousand dollars a year
sw2441A-ms98-a-0092 472.324500 477.964875 yeah um i mean that my other pet peeve is unions
sw2441A-ms98-a-0093 477.964875 485.261000 you know i[t's]- it's just it's it's ridiculous the way unions have gone i mean there w[as]- there was a time when unions were needed
sw2441A-ms98-a-0094 485.261000 497.521500 and they served a good function but but there are enough laws on the books now that unions are outdated and they're only there to perpetuate their own their own power structure
sw2441A-ms98-a-0095 497.521500 518.443625 [silence]
sw2441A-ms98-a-0096 518.443625 520.092625 yeah
sw2441A-ms98-a-0097 520.092625 525.962625 sure and tha[t]- and tha[t]- and and that's that's really what happened to the steel industry in this country
sw2441A-ms98-a-0098 525.962625 535.749500 [noise] so many times i mean you had the uh the coal miners and steel workers going out at the same time and uh well that took care of that industry
sw2441A-ms98-a-0099 535.749500 542.775375 now and then and and i'll tell you Detroit worked awfully hard on on stopping car manufacturing in this country
sw2441A-ms98-a-0100 542.775375 543.889750 [silence]
sw2441A-ms98-a-0101 543.889750 548.662500 yeah i mean you know w[e've]- we've never caught up and i don't think we ever will
sw2441A-ms98-a-0102 548.662500 556.062500 um yeah i mean here it is i mean we've got to we've got to go into partnership with the Japanese to build cars
sw2441A-ms98-a-0103 556.062500 564.668125 [laughter-yeah] and they only did it because they i guess they're embarrassed [laughter] tha[t]- that they're so good at it [laughter]
sw2441A-ms98-a-0104 564.668125 575.216250 [laughter] gosh yeah well i'm back to the original subject yeah i i think i think youngsters ought to go out and do some public service i i don't care what kind it is
sw2441A-ms98-a-0105 575.216250 576.906250 [silence]
sw2441A-ms98-a-0106 576.906250 580.154375 yeah and pride in themselves too they
sw2441A-ms98-a-0107 580.154375 589.940625 they can they can uh i mean you could organize something just within your community yeah sa[me]- same old thing i mean if sure um-hum
sw2441A-ms98-a-0108 589.940625 599.102125 i i think they ought to take them_1 and uh and i don't know just have sort of like a uh a a manpower pool and say okay look we need somebody
