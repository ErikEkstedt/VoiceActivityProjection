sw2416A-ms98-a-0055 217.988875 227.470125 as soon as i as soon as i can find me an ankle a good uh a good ankle brace i'm going to start playing some racquetball again but i'm not going out there with an unsupported ankle anymore

sw2416A-ms98-a-0061 253.461125 257.150250 trouble is i can't get them tight enough
sw2416A-ms98-a-0062 257.150250 265.872625 to to really give me what i feel is support um so i'm i- i- i think probably just an ace bandage would work
sw2416A-ms98-a-0063 265.872625 269.982750 but i want to get one of those um padded ankle
sw2416A-ms98-a-0064 269.982750 272.023125 what you call its

sw2416A-ms98-a-0068 288.915625 293.272375 yeah i think i'll probably just have to go with one of those splint braces or something
