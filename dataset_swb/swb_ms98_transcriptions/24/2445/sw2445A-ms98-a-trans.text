sw2445A-ms98-a-0013 82.238375 84.123375 two nights is good
sw2445A-ms98-a-0014 84.123375 87.849000 um especially there was a little store close by
sw2445A-ms98-a-0015 87.849000 90.243000 so it was pretty nice
sw2445A-ms98-a-0016 90.243000 104.879000 [silence]
sw2445A-ms98-a-0017 104.879000 107.400750 oh really oh
sw2445A-ms98-a-0018 107.400750 109.231125 [silence]
sw2445A-ms98-a-0019 109.231125 118.564875 um yeah up here you got to wait till Au[gust]- August till the water warms [laughter-up] well it's not that bad but it's still pretty chilly
sw2445A-ms98-a-0020 118.564875 130.785500 um i don't know i was i have a tent and i slept out in it in the backyard and stuff but the th[ing]- thing about camping that bothers me is you've got to pack everything
sw2445A-ms98-a-0021 130.785500 138.882750 and another thing is the thing seems to get it's [laughter-dirty] you know so you can't keep the dirt out of the tent and 
sw2445A-ms98-a-0022 138.882750 144.009625 i don't know we have a seven year old it's pretty funny like stay out
sw2445A-ms98-a-0023 144.009625 146.180875 [silence]
sw2445A-ms98-a-0024 146.180875 151.886750 [laughter-yeah] boy he he doesn't go in and out of the tent a hundred times [laughter]
sw2445A-ms98-a-0025 151.886750 155.379375 and use it as a play uh they they like to play in them_1
sw2445A-ms98-a-0026 155.379375 160.152125 [silence]
sw2445A-ms98-a-0027 160.152125 161.812000 yeah i don't know [laughter]
sw2445A-ms98-a-0028 161.812000 171.375125 [silence]
sw2445A-ms98-a-0029 171.375125 177.348375 yeah well w[hat]- what we were doing we were just going to say we're just going to sleep in the tent and hang out at night
sw2445A-ms98-a-0030 177.348375 189.887000 so you know no going in and out and or what what he wants to do we had brought his friend along was play in the tent it was like no this is not [laughter-working] you can't do that you get tent all dirty 
sw2445A-ms98-a-0031 189.887000 193.855000 plus you get it all wet because_1 we were at a beach site too
sw2445A-ms98-a-0032 193.855000 202.528000 [silence]
sw2445A-ms98-a-0033 202.528000 214.445500 n[o]- no but you know i was just thinking of getting one those for the yard because_1 th[ey]- they are really nice and um up here we have uh we have quite a few mosquitoes at nighttime
sw2445A-ms98-a-0034 214.445500 232.107500 [silence]
sw2445A-ms98-a-0035 232.107500 238.661000 yeah they're terrible [laughter] they're really terrible uh but there is this one campsite
sw2445A-ms98-a-0036 238.661000 251.218500 that it that some of them_1 are known that there is one that's out in this big lake and it's it's it's mosquitoes are terrible and then this uh there's this other one that's more up in the mountains but it surrounds a man-made reservoir
sw2445A-ms98-a-0037 251.218500 256.938750 and there's no bugs that's the whole thing that everyone told me oh i'm i was going to go to Little Little River State Park
sw2445A-ms98-a-0038 256.938750 267.188000 they go oh that place is great there's no bugs [laughter] but oh okay because uh we were having a b[ig]- a really big problem up here in certain areas we were really affected that bad
sw2445A-ms98-a-0039 267.188000 281.195375 but really bad it um almost destroyed the [vocalized-noise] the tourism in one town because of the mosquitoes they're so bad yeah that was it's a really nice area i've been there before and it's
sw2445A-ms98-a-0040 281.195375 290.671625 i i couldn't imagine ge[t]- living just sixty miles north of them but they were plagued they were plagued with them with mosquitoes
sw2445A-ms98-a-0041 290.671625 291.741125 [silence]
sw2445A-ms98-a-0042 291.741125 300.262500 and you can go out outside in the daytime all right but the minute the sun went down [noise] that's when it seems like the minute the sun sets the mosquitoes come out
sw2445A-ms98-a-0043 300.262500 306.409375 i mean just the very second it's really strange they uh they must uh
sw2445A-ms98-a-0044 306.409375 309.325625 work on that you know the
sw2445A-ms98-a-0045 309.325625 313.690875 the it gets cooler when the sun sets and then they all come out
sw2445A-ms98-a-0046 313.690875 321.853250 [silence]
sw2445A-ms98-a-0047 321.853250 326.268625 oh oh yeah yeah i never really noticed how effective they were
sw2445A-ms98-a-0048 326.268625 336.632625 but um because that wasn't really i- i bought them_1 and i didn't really get to use them_1 like oh there's mosquitoes let's turn them on we just sort of lit them 
sw2445A-ms98-a-0049 336.632625 343.581625 and um we weren't bothered that much by mosquitoes so we didn't really contribute it to that but
sw2445A-ms98-a-0050 343.581625 354.412750 um i think in an area that's really thick with mosquitoes i can't see all this little uh smoke buckets i call [laughter-them_1] how they work but they they're suppose to work really well
sw2445A-ms98-a-0051 354.412750 355.558250 [silence]
sw2445A-ms98-a-0052 355.558250 362.679000 oh i'm in my paperwork here that's what i do when i wait for a phone call i get in my paperwork [laughter]
sw2445A-ms98-a-0053 362.679000 365.789875 [laughter] oh
sw2445A-ms98-a-0054 365.789875 368.512125 to find my most important parts
sw2445A-ms98-a-0055 368.512125 371.786500 but i don't know i don't know if i'm going to go
sw2445A-ms98-a-0056 371.786500 379.756875 g[o]- i wish i was an avid camper and i could really talk about like gardening or something i can talk about that a lot but um 
sw2445A-ms98-a-0057 379.756875 389.482125 i do want to go again we just moved to a new hou[se]- into a house so i don't see camping maybe in the backyard but i don't see going on a camping trip probably till next summer
sw2445A-ms98-a-0058 389.482125 400.074375 [silence]
sw2445A-ms98-a-0059 400.074375 403.060375 so it's easy for you to go

sw2445A-ms98-a-0069 428.318000 429.370500 [silence]
sw2445A-ms98-a-0070 429.370500 435.909625 tha[t]- that is the best way to do it is to have a a nice vehicle where you can have everything in it plus your tent
sw2445A-ms98-a-0071 435.909625 439.632875 [silence]
sw2445A-ms98-a-0072 439.632875 440.832875 yep

sw2445A-ms98-a-0076 452.969875 460.863875 well those they're kind of nice but they're also um flimsy when you really look at them_1 but then when you get inside they're really nice you know
sw2445A-ms98-a-0077 460.863875 472.218750 everything's really [vocalized-noise] but then when you look underneath it it's just got these little wheels and this just this uh little axle it's like oh my and then a big windstorm it would pick you up 
sw2445A-ms98-a-0078 472.218750 492.788500 [silence]
sw2445A-ms98-a-0079 492.788500 500.416500 oh jeez yeah what do you what do you do when you get a i mean like a really violent storm like a tornado just stay in your truck
sw2445A-ms98-a-0080 500.416500 502.826125 i i mean i wouldn't stay in the um

sw2445A-ms98-a-0098 575.721375 586.788625 it's like a little house except the whole face is open and the one time that we went we got one it was overlooking the water but it was a big embankment i wanted to get one right on the water
sw2445A-ms98-a-0099 586.788625 598.641625 that was then when we had uh an electrical storm too and it was really it was neat sitting there watching it i mean it was raining when we called in home everybody said oh we were worried about you in that storm
