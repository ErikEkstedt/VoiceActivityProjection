sw2443B-ms98-a-0051 185.123375 191.293250 and may[be]- and i knew i wanted to be in engineering so i was looking for a good engineering school so i ended up going to Tech in Lubbock
sw2443B-ms98-a-0052 191.293250 202.219625 so i was there i was you know two hours away from home so any weekend i wanted to come home i got in the car hopped you know i was home in a couple of hours and so that worked out real well and

sw2443B-ms98-a-0085 340.655625 350.335500 these uh name schools and and of course they would get out but they got they ended up getting more or less the same job i did and then they but they're thirty thousand in debt from student loans

sw2443B-ms98-a-0100 409.100250 412.867875 yeah and they're all going to have to pay it back they're going to be in debt for the rest of their lives
sw2443B-ms98-a-0101 412.867875 416.116750 [silence]
sw2443B-ms98-a-0102 416.116750 428.892000 i guess the the main thing if i was recommending to someone like you said y[ou've]- you've got you've got do something you can afford but then to go to a school that also is is somewhat well known at least in the state for what you want to do
sw2443B-ms98-a-0103 428.892000 434.481125 because_1 like Tech is known to be a good engineering school and A and M maybe is known more for computers
sw2443B-ms98-a-0104 434.481125 441.454500 and that kind of thing i w[ould]- i would if if you know what you're going to do i think that would be important to deal with too because
sw2443B-ms98-a-0105 441.454500 453.302625 when you then when you do try and get your foot in the door at the various compa[nies]- the companies that you would possibly want to work for tend to interview more heavily at those locations because they know that that particular school had a good department
sw2443B-ms98-a-0106 453.302625 458.268750 you know in in computer science or in engineering or in business or or whatever
sw2443B-ms98-a-0107 458.268750 481.014125 [silence]
sw2443B-ms98-a-0108 481.014125 482.315250 um-hum

sw2443B-ms98-a-0110 486.704625 489.245000 will transfer so that's good yeah

sw2443B-ms98-a-0116 511.615125 515.830250 i i think to some extent you're right most people have a general idea
sw2443B-ms98-a-0117 515.830250 522.358625 and then there's there's probably that probably fifty percent have a general idea and the other fifty percent are waiting to see what hits them_1 when they get there

sw2443B-ms98-a-0126 573.960375 580.343625 i had yeah i was in public school i was in all honors classes i was also a a National Merit Scholar
sw2443B-ms98-a-0127 580.343625 586.206625 and i had the i think the other thing that a lot of kids would benefit from in high school is taking an aptitude test
sw2443B-ms98-a-0128 586.206625 599.457125 because there are some good ones out there and i know in in our high school at least they offered several different ones where you went through and you know you answer all these questions back and forth and things it it ended up being things that you liked versus things that you had an aptitude
