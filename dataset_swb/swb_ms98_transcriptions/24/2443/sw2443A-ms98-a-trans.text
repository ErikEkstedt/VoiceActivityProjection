sw2443A-ms98-a-0035 112.185875 114.707625 [silence]
sw2443A-ms98-a-0036 114.707625 123.937750 well it['s]- it's interesting because it sort of fits their it sort of fits their personality uh my oldest who's a senior at UTD now
sw2443A-ms98-a-0037 123.937750 130.608750 she uh uh always our house borders Richland College i mean you walk out our back door and you're on the campus
sw2443A-ms98-a-0038 130.608750 141.821750 and she uh has always uh never really wanted to leave home and uh it turns out that when she came time to go to college well we're in the Philippines in fact she stayed out there with us for a year
sw2443A-ms98-a-0039 141.821750 148.536625 then uh uh we brought her back and set her up in an apartment she went to Richland and then moved back in the house when we got back
sw2443A-ms98-a-0040 148.536625 160.515625 but she just kind of went t[o]- from Richland to UTD and it's too bad she's never lived on a campus and she has a younger sister who's a freshman at Saint Edwards in Austin who is living on a campus
sw2443A-ms98-a-0041 160.515625 165.378000 and she sees what what she's missed out of college now wishes that she'd done something like that
sw2443A-ms98-a-0042 165.378000 172.396375 but at at eighteen you know uh uh i i wa[nted]- i wanted her to go away but she was just too much of a home kid
sw2443A-ms98-a-0043 172.396375 176.062125 [silence]
sw2443A-ms98-a-0044 176.062125 177.131000 uh-huh

sw2443A-ms98-a-0048 190.920000 192.261500 oh okay
sw2443A-ms98-a-0049 192.261500 197.303625 [silence]
sw2443A-ms98-a-0050 197.303625 198.381500 yeah
sw2443A-ms98-a-0051 198.381500 203.951000 oh yeah that that yeah yeah that's not a bad deal well my my middle daughter who's a freshman
sw2443A-ms98-a-0052 203.951000 214.802250 she has always wanted to live on campus and she'd been kind of a home body i mean this is the kid who who uh when she was little and went to stay over at somebody's house at night i'd always know i'd get a call at ten o'clock to come get her
sw2443A-ms98-a-0053 214.802250 220.045500 uh [laughter-i] [laughter-mean] because_1 i[t]- when it came bedtime she wanted to be in her own bed but uh she uh
sw2443A-ms98-a-0054 220.045500 233.177500 uh i was raised in New England and went to school in New England and she always thought she wanted to go to school in New England she and i took an interview trip last year and she was accepted by several of the of the good schools there but when it came down time to make a decision she said dad
sw2443A-ms98-a-0055 233.177500 236.513000 i don't think i want to go that far [laughter-away] i've never been away before
sw2443A-ms98-a-0056 236.513000 249.518375 so uh uh she wanted to go to a small school so uh U[T]- like a place like UT was out of the question because she needed to be in a more of a small smaller school environment so uh we went down one uh uh i took a day off from work and
sw2443A-ms98-a-0057 249.518375 262.129625 and we went down uh to Saint Edwards and interviewed and i[t]- it just kind of met her her criteria it's a school of about twenty five hundred undergraduates on a gigantic big campus and it's in Austin's a nice city
sw2443A-ms98-a-0058 262.129625 272.013500 uh and it's and she's pretty happy i mean she's here she's finishing up her freshman year and she's pretty happy and likes Austin and i got a son though who is a senior at Berkner
sw2443A-ms98-a-0059 272.013500 281.070750 he is not academically inclined at all he's very uh kind of unacademically inclined he wants badly to go to Tech because that's where all all his friends in the neighborhood are going
sw2443A-ms98-a-0060 281.070750 294.880625 and he uh i don't think he didn't apply i don't think he'd get admitted there but he's starting to get enough motivated he wants to go there that i think he'll go to Richland and take what he needs to have to take to qualify in Tech and then try to go to Tech the next year
sw2443A-ms98-a-0061 294.880625 295.969625 yeah
sw2443A-ms98-a-0062 295.969625 297.064750 [silence]
sw2443A-ms98-a-0063 297.064750 298.730500 oh sure
sw2443A-ms98-a-0064 298.730500 309.962250 y[eah]- right and and he went out there and spent a weekend with some friends here back a month or two and and what i like is that when he saw it i think he's now motivated to to to go to work
sw2443A-ms98-a-0065 309.962250 311.998500 yeah yeah
sw2443A-ms98-a-0066 311.998500 326.254000 yeah and the uh uh i[n]- i[n]- you know one thing you know in in terms of how how i i would advise people is of course you got to look at what you can afford too and the state school system in Texas uh is probably one of the least expensive in the world
sw2443A-ms98-a-0067 326.254000 334.479000 uh again i mean people think it's expensive but you my goodness state schools in Massachusetts and the other New England states cost more than private schools do here
sw2443A-ms98-a-0068 334.479000 347.074750 [silence]
sw2443A-ms98-a-0069 347.074750 348.475000 yeah they end up yeah
sw2443A-ms98-a-0070 348.475000 349.575500 [silence]
sw2443A-ms98-a-0071 349.575500 354.812625 yeah you end up getting the same degree and it's it's uh uh
sw2443A-ms98-a-0072 354.812625 361.840250 now i i think that that what happens is the prestige you you can't you you can't sell that too much
sw2443A-ms98-a-0073 361.840250 365.503875 uh because after all the degree just gets you in the door
sw2443A-ms98-a-0074 365.503875 372.619750 i[t's]- it's what you do after that that that that that uh i[t]- that really judges how far you're going to go with a degree
sw2443A-ms98-a-0075 372.619750 379.781125 and i think that uh it's getting so darned expensive now i went to a school in Maine Bowden College in Brunswick Maine
sw2443A-ms98-a-0076 379.781125 391.662000 and uh it's a a small at that time all male school there are more uh uh males uh men's schools than women's schools in those days they're all all the old New England traditional schools are now coed
sw2443A-ms98-a-0077 391.662000 400.692375 but uh and you know i'm i'm talking about the early nineteen fifties and you know tuition was six hundred dollars a year my goodness it's eighteen thousand now
sw2443A-ms98-a-0078 400.692375 409.785500 and i don't know how and uh i mean they always have a waiting list a mile long for students and the only thing i did notice is about seventy percent of the students are on some kind of financial aid
sw2443A-ms98-a-0079 409.785500 410.787375 and
sw2443A-ms98-a-0080 410.787375 411.511125 [silence]
sw2443A-ms98-a-0081 411.511125 415.950125 and they're going to be i[n]- they're going to be in debt for the rest of their lives yeah uh
sw2443A-ms98-a-0082 415.950125 417.215750 uh
sw2443A-ms98-a-0083 417.215750 421.357250 [silence]
sw2443A-ms98-a-0084 421.357250 422.625000 yeah
sw2443A-ms98-a-0085 422.625000 428.250125 [silence]
sw2443A-ms98-a-0086 428.250125 429.489125 yeah
sw2443A-ms98-a-0087 429.489125 434.122250 [silence]
sw2443A-ms98-a-0088 434.122250 435.248000 right
sw2443A-ms98-a-0089 435.248000 457.418500 [silence]
sw2443A-ms98-a-0090 457.418500 464.722500 yeah i i i i think that's exactly right and you know a lot of girls that go into engineering know what they want to do
sw2443A-ms98-a-0091 464.722500 478.823625 uh you know i've got two daughters that started off g[oing]- well w[ell]- well my oldest thought she wanted to major in psychology and she's carried through on that uh uh Tracy is what in April of her freshman year and she's gone from political science to international studies
sw2443A-ms98-a-0092 478.823625 487.481000 to bilingual education to elementary education and fortunately as a as a freshman everything she's taken has has been uh is applicable
sw2443A-ms98-a-0093 487.481000 494.194250 yeah i[t's]- i[t's]- it's applicable to those degrees and and and those are strong degrees all of them_1 in in the school that she's going
sw2443A-ms98-a-0094 494.194250 504.834375 and and i i think you made a very good point though that somebody that is really has some direction and knows what they want to do uh then they need to go go to a school that's got a good reputation in that field
sw2443A-ms98-a-0095 504.834375 511.683125 and uh uh but i would guess a very very small percent of college freshmen know what they want to do
sw2443A-ms98-a-0096 511.683125 513.431250 [silence]
sw2443A-ms98-a-0097 513.431250 514.564000 yeah
sw2443A-ms98-a-0098 514.564000 515.396125 [silence]
sw2443A-ms98-a-0099 515.396125 516.874250 yeah i

sw2443A-ms98-a-0101 518.951375 519.965750 yeah
sw2443A-ms98-a-0102 519.965750 521.662000 [silence]
sw2443A-ms98-a-0103 521.662000 533.321750 yeah i i w[ent]- i went off to school wanting to either be a high school algebra teacher or high school French teacher because my two favorite people in the in high school were my algebra teacher and French teacher and uh
sw2443A-ms98-a-0104 533.321750 543.657750 and i was going to do that until the end of our sophomore year when we wanted uh we came time to sign up for majors and i had taken chemistry for the first time that year and surprised myself i did well in it
sw2443A-ms98-a-0105 543.657750 553.496250 and and sort of made a decision as we were walk[ing]- me and a friend of mine were walking over to campus uh to to sign up for our majors it was just sort of an off the wall decision
sw2443A-ms98-a-0106 553.496250 559.820375 and uh uh but i had no earthly i didn't do well in chemistry in high school and had no earthly idea that i'd get my degree in chemistry
sw2443A-ms98-a-0107 559.820375 574.353750 on on the way in so it's uh but i i think uh a person who has some idea like you did is is is well uh y[ou]- you know that that helps a lot were you uh well prepared for Tech in in your school did you go to public school in Midland
sw2443A-ms98-a-0108 574.353750 579.844750 [silence]
sw2443A-ms98-a-0109 579.844750 582.329125 oh okay well y[ou]- you you had a lot of things going
