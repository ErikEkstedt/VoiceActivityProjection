sw2484B-ms98-a-0010 18.815500 21.608875 [silence]
sw2484B-ms98-a-0011 21.608875 35.669125 uh if if i understood correctly it was what what changes we might uh suggest or whatever for the justice system is that [laughter] perhaps above my head
sw2484B-ms98-a-0012 35.669125 41.850125 [silence]
sw2484B-ms98-a-0013 41.850125 47.613875 sentencing and would all the jurors have to agree on okay that'd be a good place to start
sw2484B-ms98-a-0014 47.613875 48.819500 [silence]
sw2484B-ms98-a-0015 48.819500 49.955750 all right

sw2484B-ms98-a-0018 54.543250 60.347750 [silence]
sw2484B-ms98-a-0019 60.347750 62.858625 was it was it a criminal
sw2484B-ms98-a-0020 62.858625 63.905625 okay
sw2484B-ms98-a-0021 63.905625 65.745500 [silence]
sw2484B-ms98-a-0022 65.745500 67.594750 oh oh [laughter]

sw2484B-ms98-a-0024 77.919375 79.546250 oh my
sw2484B-ms98-a-0025 79.546250 85.120250 [silence]
sw2484B-ms98-a-0026 85.120250 86.012125 huh
sw2484B-ms98-a-0027 86.012125 90.675875 [silence]
sw2484B-ms98-a-0028 90.675875 91.965875 uh
sw2484B-ms98-a-0029 91.965875 96.052000 [silence]
sw2484B-ms98-a-0030 96.052000 99.536250 it really does sound like it was a self defense kind of thing
sw2484B-ms98-a-0031 99.536250 108.791375 [silence]
sw2484B-ms98-a-0032 108.791375 119.678750 no i served on on both a criminal and a a civil um jury and in my criminal trial he pled guilty
sw2484B-ms98-a-0033 119.678750 131.781000 um to the first to to kidnapping and so we went through the the second part of the trial because_1 in Texas there are two parts first of all to find if they are guilty or innocent 
sw2484B-ms98-a-0034 131.781000 139.197000 he already said he's guilty so then then we go through the trial to determine what uh punishment should be meted out
sw2484B-ms98-a-0035 139.197000 151.593375 so we still went through three days of of uh testimony and so forth and and witnesses saying oh he's an upstanding young man just weak and was led by another guy and so forth
sw2484B-ms98-a-0036 151.593375 159.542250 so we were the ones that that came up with the sentence and the judge gave us some parameters and said you know
sw2484B-ms98-a-0037 159.542250 170.510875 according to the law it can be no more or no le[ss]- uh no more or less than and he gave th[e]- the number of years and he said it would also include a a possible fine
sw2484B-ms98-a-0038 170.510875 177.368375 up to ten thousand dollars and and we had that's that took us six hours just to agree
sw2484B-ms98-a-0039 177.368375 181.371875 on what we thought was appropriate for this young man
sw2484B-ms98-a-0040 181.371875 184.349875 [silence]
sw2484B-ms98-a-0041 184.349875 185.510625 um
sw2484B-ms98-a-0042 185.510625 186.532500 [silence]
sw2484B-ms98-a-0043 186.532500 197.896125 it wasn't the easiest thing i've done but nor nor was it hard to to us the young man had kind of taken care of it when he said he was guilty so we did not 
sw2484B-ms98-a-0044 197.896125 212.693375 we didn't have to struggle at all with that it was now what's fitting and and we'd gone through you know all that so i- i don't know i thought that was easier than than trying to decide his guilt or innocence yeah
sw2484B-ms98-a-0045 212.693375 220.474375 i- i probably would not mind letting the judge do the sentencing
sw2484B-ms98-a-0046 220.474375 232.102500 as long as the jury of of peers were determining guilt or innocence for one thing we didn't know that the others involved in the trial had uh
sw2484B-ms98-a-0047 232.102500 243.120000 or i- or i mean had [vocalized-noise] involved in the crime had already come up for trial we couldn't know what had come of their uh sentencing 
sw2484B-ms98-a-0048 243.120000 250.245125 and and we couldn't know that until after we'd made our findings so it turned out we had done about what the other juries had done
sw2484B-ms98-a-0049 250.245125 260.131625 and so it you know we felt a little better but i think if that could be in the hands of of someone who knew the law and could be privy to that information seems like it would be fairer
sw2484B-ms98-a-0050 260.131625 261.621000 [silence]
sw2484B-ms98-a-0051 261.621000 265.532750 since it's state uh laws yes
sw2484B-ms98-a-0052 265.532750 276.376875 [silence]
sw2484B-ms98-a-0053 276.376875 279.729125 it n[ow]- now it may be on some
sw2484B-ms98-a-0054 279.729125 284.124000 Federal Laws you know i[t]- it this was a
sw2484B-ms98-a-0055 284.124000 286.466875 [silence]
sw2484B-ms98-a-0056 286.466875 298.433500 [laughter-we] were dealing with uh with the state laws not necessarily [vocalized-noise] not necessarily federal that may have something to do with it and it may be too that if it were um a capital crime
sw2484B-ms98-a-0057 298.433500 303.301750 uh capital murder or something like that that that it may be different 
sw2484B-ms98-a-0058 303.301750 306.525625 [silence]
sw2484B-ms98-a-0059 306.525625 307.765625 yes it would
sw2484B-ms98-a-0060 307.765625 317.475750 [silence]
sw2484B-ms98-a-0061 317.475750 322.843375 w[ell]- i had a friend who sat in on a or who was on a jury recently for a murder
sw2484B-ms98-a-0062 322.843375 330.508875 but the man was not being tried for capital murder and so that was not even an option
sw2484B-ms98-a-0063 330.508875 334.214625 uh the death penalty was not an option
sw2484B-ms98-a-0064 334.214625 344.187375 so and in in this case everyone on the jury felt that it should have [laughter-been] and they were very convinced the man had no redeeming 
sw2484B-ms98-a-0065 344.187375 355.018125 uh qualities and couldn't be rehabilitated and they were they were really upset that he was getting off so lightly for the heinous crime that he had been involved in
sw2484B-ms98-a-0066 355.018125 356.566625 [silence]
sw2484B-ms98-a-0067 356.566625 361.292500 i'm real glad that i don't i [laughter] i [laughter-don't] work in that kind of a 
sw2484B-ms98-a-0068 361.292500 363.061500 uh a back[ground]-
sw2484B-ms98-a-0069 363.061500 366.042750 background i'll take my job any day
sw2484B-ms98-a-0070 366.042750 366.653000 [noise]
sw2484B-ms98-a-0071 366.653000 368.132125 you know [laughter]
sw2484B-ms98-a-0072 368.132125 377.342750 i don't work with perfect people anymore than anybody else does but i can handle the imperfections that i'm around i- i could not work in the in
sw2484B-ms98-a-0073 377.342750 385.438750 the uh criminal area for very long as a as a police officer as uh someone who works for the court system or whatever
sw2484B-ms98-a-0074 385.438750 391.758375 so anyway back to the original question i really think i if if we were still allowed to choose guilt or innocence
sw2484B-ms98-a-0075 391.758375 396.906250 i'd be more than happy to let the judge determine the uh the sentencing
sw2484B-ms98-a-0076 396.906250 403.716500 [silence]
sw2484B-ms98-a-0077 403.716500 404.834750 [laughter]

sw2484B-ms98-a-0089 438.523500 443.774750 it probably is which is about what it costs you to park your car right
sw2484B-ms98-a-0090 443.774750 445.732125 oh do they
sw2484B-ms98-a-0091 445.732125 447.357500 oh okay

sw2484B-ms98-a-0097 463.787375 466.497875 y[eah]- i- i can see how that would be difficult
sw2484B-ms98-a-0098 466.497875 469.623375 [silence]
sw2484B-ms98-a-0099 469.623375 476.157000 [laughter] before you go oh that would be tough
sw2484B-ms98-a-0100 476.157000 477.802125 um
sw2484B-ms98-a-0101 477.802125 481.422250 [silence]
sw2484B-ms98-a-0102 481.422250 490.448000 what about the other suggestion that they had that uh about the ju[ry]- all the jury agreeing on the senten[cing]- do you feel that that is a requirement
sw2484B-ms98-a-0103 490.448000 495.293250 [silence]
sw2484B-ms98-a-0104 495.293250 498.427250 that the[re]- there should be a[greement]- agreement
sw2484B-ms98-a-0105 498.427250 500.849875 i think i do too
sw2484B-ms98-a-0106 500.849875 506.837000 [silence]
sw2484B-ms98-a-0107 506.837000 507.853000 um-hum

sw2484B-ms98-a-0109 510.057500 521.943750 it's it's it's so easy anyway for everybody to just kind of become a yes man and get carried up along with the emotions and so if there's somebody who's strong enough to stand up with a specific doubt
sw2484B-ms98-a-0110 521.943750 532.581250 i would a whole lot rather go through the expense of another trial because of a hung jury than that a justice not be meted out correctly
sw2484B-ms98-a-0111 532.581250 534.292125 [noise] so
sw2484B-ms98-a-0112 534.292125 540.929125 [noise] i agree with boy it's really easy [laughter] to discuss something when you both agree [laughter]
sw2484B-ms98-a-0113 540.929125 558.620000 [silence]
sw2484B-ms98-a-0114 558.620000 561.736750 well it took us six hours to reach agreement yeah
sw2484B-ms98-a-0115 561.736750 585.600000 [silence]
sw2484B-ms98-a-0116 585.600000 586.772625 yeah
