sw2486A-ms98-a-0002 2.497875 12.717750 well uh i am basically retired now i was a member i was in education and in administration so basically i wore
sw2486A-ms98-a-0003 12.717750 27.008875 dresses and uh heels and i was never one uh because my work often took me into court uh never was one that got uh accustomed to wearing pants suits and pants to work
sw2486A-ms98-a-0004 27.008875 40.104000 but that was just me i know many people are co[mfortable]- very comfortable in the classroom and what have you wearing pants uh it i guess i was just old enough not to uh be very comfortable in it how about_1 you
sw2486A-ms98-a-0005 40.104000 60.027000 [silence]
sw2486A-ms98-a-0006 60.027000 61.033375 oh
sw2486A-ms98-a-0007 61.033375 63.401750 [silence]
sw2486A-ms98-a-0008 63.401750 64.956250 um-hum
sw2486A-ms98-a-0009 64.956250 72.127250 [silence]
sw2486A-ms98-a-0010 72.127250 74.110125 [laughter]
sw2486A-ms98-a-0011 74.110125 77.133750 [silence]
sw2486A-ms98-a-0012 77.133750 78.900000 um-hum
sw2486A-ms98-a-0013 78.900000 88.196500 [silence]
sw2486A-ms98-a-0014 88.196500 89.655125 yes
sw2486A-ms98-a-0015 89.655125 90.777125 [silence]
sw2486A-ms98-a-0016 90.777125 105.247625 and i think that does make a difference because when you do have to be in front of people uh i think you the the tendency there is to wear dresses and suits and and uh more classical style of clothing 
sw2486A-ms98-a-0017 105.247625 107.271875 what about the miniskirt
sw2486A-ms98-a-0018 107.271875 132.947625 [silence]
sw2486A-ms98-a-0019 132.947625 136.053625 [laughter]

sw2486A-ms98-a-0022 144.881125 147.647625 [silence]
sw2486A-ms98-a-0023 147.647625 161.403750 well there are miniskirts and there are miniskirts there are some that are really short and then there are some that may be will come like four inches or five inches above the knee and again it depends upon the size the shape of the person
sw2486A-ms98-a-0024 161.403750 165.242625 as well as the shape of the person's legs
sw2486A-ms98-a-0025 165.242625 174.096750 now i also uh even though i retired from education i uh i do modeling and i teach at a modeling agency here
sw2486A-ms98-a-0026 174.096750 187.692000 and uh so when we are doing {wardrobing} and we have uh two two hour classes in wardrobe we do discuss a great deal the miniskirt and the types of clothes to wear on the job
sw2486A-ms98-a-0027 187.692000 193.083875 uh even though i may have them from sixth grade on up through uh grandmothers
sw2486A-ms98-a-0028 193.083875 204.203250 in my class and uh [vocalized-noise] way i always try to emphasize the clothes that you wear should not necessarily be the greatest fad 
sw2486A-ms98-a-0029 204.203250 213.256375 because maybe they those are not the clothes that are the most uh appealing to you or the most um complimentary to you
sw2486A-ms98-a-0030 213.256375 218.627375 but uh the miniskirt many times will evoke comments you don't really want
sw2486A-ms98-a-0031 218.627375 219.791625 [silence]
sw2486A-ms98-a-0032 219.791625 224.409500 and and then uh then you're in the situation where you're very unhappy
sw2486A-ms98-a-0033 224.409500 231.795750 [silence]
sw2486A-ms98-a-0034 231.795750 233.703500 that's right
sw2486A-ms98-a-0035 233.703500 237.113125 [silence]
sw2486A-ms98-a-0036 237.113125 244.935250 well i- i uh i have to agree with that even when they was very very popular in the early sixties uh i uh
sw2486A-ms98-a-0037 244.935250 259.323625 uh again maybe because i was at the school there were still many teachers who wore miniskirts uh we had no regulation against it and a lot of the kids did of course and it could be very embarrassing for the men teachers
sw2486A-ms98-a-0038 259.323625 264.672125 because they were not that careful in how they handled themselves in those miniskirts
sw2486A-ms98-a-0039 264.672125 274.872375 and so i think uh uh of course now i go the other extreme i do not like to see in the corporate areas uh all the women dressed like men
sw2486A-ms98-a-0040 274.872375 282.487875 with the suits and uh white shirts and ties and what have you so that they all look exactly the same
sw2486A-ms98-a-0041 282.487875 287.428000 uh i don't like that i don't i think there should be individuality in dressing
sw2486A-ms98-a-0042 287.428000 296.050000 [silence]
sw2486A-ms98-a-0043 296.050000 297.333750 yes
sw2486A-ms98-a-0044 297.333750 300.952125 [silence]
sw2486A-ms98-a-0045 300.952125 302.445500 right
sw2486A-ms98-a-0046 302.445500 303.439500 [silence]
sw2486A-ms98-a-0047 303.439500 310.178500 well i and i don't think that you have to be manish and extremely tailored to to look professional
sw2486A-ms98-a-0048 310.178500 324.524000 i think that you you make of that what you wish and you can go the opposite direction and uh overdo all the frills and laces and flounces and what have you which don't belong in the uh at least in my opinion
sw2486A-ms98-a-0049 324.524000 339.501250 in the workplace uh but that that you can have a classical look without a lot of a great deal of adornment and what have you and still be very feminine because that was one thing i always fought against i started out as a physical education teacher
sw2486A-ms98-a-0050 339.501250 351.928500 so i was always fighting against the idea of looking tailored or mannish uh and people would never ever guess that i was phys ed and um and that pleased me
sw2486A-ms98-a-0051 351.928500 360.721500 uh and uh so then i of course just continued what i considered the best style of clothing for me at work
sw2486A-ms98-a-0052 360.721500 366.915250 and uh and i find even [vocalized-noise] even at home here now i- i will wear blue jeans or i'll wear shorts
sw2486A-ms98-a-0053 366.915250 377.272375 and what have you uh and be very comfortable but when i go out somewhere then uh unless i have a pair of dress slacks i don't usually wear a lot of blue jeans
sw2486A-ms98-a-0054 377.272375 390.036125 i have difficulty getting them to fit me comfortably any how and so uh uh i just feel that uh you know each person has to dress to their own liking and for their own comfort
sw2486A-ms98-a-0055 390.036125 398.124625 but uh there are certain norms that companies should be able to uh put out as guidelines for their employees
sw2486A-ms98-a-0056 398.124625 407.931250 [silence]
sw2486A-ms98-a-0057 407.931250 410.690500 [laughter]

sw2486A-ms98-a-0066 429.208875 430.757250 that's good

sw2486A-ms98-a-0068 434.623625 437.032250 yeah um-hum

sw2486A-ms98-a-0074 470.297500 472.332500 right right
sw2486A-ms98-a-0075 472.332500 482.549500 [silence]
sw2486A-ms98-a-0076 482.549500 484.004750 yeah
sw2486A-ms98-a-0077 484.004750 486.640750 [silence]
sw2486A-ms98-a-0078 486.640750 494.926000 yeah well i don't either unfortunately i don't have to work in those companies [laughter] but uh i- i uh
sw2486A-ms98-a-0079 494.926000 507.363250 did have a group come over from one of the banks over the children's hospital where i was volunteering and uh they were doing a presentation and every one of the young execs coming up
sw2486A-ms98-a-0080 507.363250 510.670750 were dressed exactly alike men and women
sw2486A-ms98-a-0081 510.670750 523.042250 they all had on the gray jackets and the gray trousers or sla[cks]- or skirts and the white blouses and the same color tie i mean you could hardly tell the women from the men except for the lengths of the pants
sw2486A-ms98-a-0082 523.042250 530.542625 and one was a skirt and one was a pant and uh and i think that's sad because that doesn't allow for any individuality
sw2486A-ms98-a-0083 530.542625 533.760500 that's uh can stifle creativity
sw2486A-ms98-a-0084 533.760500 535.531250 [silence]
sw2486A-ms98-a-0085 535.531250 536.629750 so
sw2486A-ms98-a-0086 536.629750 537.860375 [silence]
sw2486A-ms98-a-0087 537.860375 541.555000 i guess so well it's been nice talking with you
sw2486A-ms98-a-0088 541.555000 543.947500 uh-huh bye-bye
