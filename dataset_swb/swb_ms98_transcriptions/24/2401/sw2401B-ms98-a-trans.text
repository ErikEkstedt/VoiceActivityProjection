sw2401B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 4.349500 okay the car if i buy a car it'd probably be an American made car
sw2401B-ms98-a-0002 4.349500 14.147875 [laughter] that's what's with me wrong because i feel of the economy i would probably buy an American made car even though sometimes the foreign cars are better but we're losing a lot of money
sw2401B-ms98-a-0003 14.147875 19.059125 [laughter] buying foreign cars and people getting out of jobs as it is
sw2401B-ms98-a-0004 19.059125 22.432375 so i'd probably buy i've always own American car

sw2401B-ms98-a-0040 157.462000 162.116000 and there is no problem with the car see the i think
sw2401B-ms98-a-0041 162.116000 168.547500 huh-uh huh-uh my air conditioner went out but i mean [noise] ten years [laughter]
sw2401B-ms98-a-0042 168.547500 173.970125 but uh i mean as far as major there's nothing major with the car
sw2401B-ms98-a-0043 173.970125 176.081500 but
sw2401B-ms98-a-0044 176.081500 186.819250 it i think what it is the American public had made good cars at one time and then they started more or less trying to hurry stuff
sw2401B-ms98-a-0045 186.819250 200.204875 the first car i think now that they have that's uh that's [vocalized-noise] made it on the what do you call it the mechanic's list or the the why they check the how they judge cars what is it list where they come out with the consumer list
sw2401B-ms98-a-0046 200.204875 203.562375 yeah is a is a is a Taurus
sw2401B-ms98-a-0047 203.562375 207.287625 yeah that's the first one that's made it
sw2401B-ms98-a-0048 207.287625 217.358125 and uh its a you know it's a four door it's a nice car now for me to buy a Taurus i would have to buy top of the line Taurus and that's Taurus Show
sw2401B-ms98-a-0049 217.358125 223.859750 it's it's it's it has a four speed i like that stick shift [laughter]
sw2401B-ms98-a-0050 223.859750 228.159000 but see that's top of the line that costs twenty whereas a Taurus would cost about
sw2401B-ms98-a-0051 228.159000 231.671750 a regular Taurus i think is twelve or thirteen
sw2401B-ms98-a-0052 231.671750 233.168000 [silence]
sw2401B-ms98-a-0053 233.168000 240.922500 huh-uh the the yeah see the Taurus Show has the spoiler kit and the and the big engine and the and stuff like that
sw2401B-ms98-a-0054 240.922500 243.247750 [silence]
sw2401B-ms98-a-0055 243.247750 248.135875 it has the well yeah i think it has the it has that engine like the Mustang
sw2401B-ms98-a-0056 248.135875 254.401875 yeah and it's a four it's i think it's you know the speed uh uh manual transmission 
sw2401B-ms98-a-0057 254.401875 256.145500 so
sw2401B-ms98-a-0058 256.145500 262.910000 but yes i would definitely buy one of those before if i had to between that and Lincoln i'd probably buy the Show
sw2401B-ms98-a-0059 262.910000 272.932375 [silence]

sw2401B-ms98-a-0073 307.871875 312.154625 why you can't still go fast so what's the difference that's what i don't understand
sw2401B-ms98-a-0074 312.154625 321.472750 you know they're making it so that they're talking about the wind current and how how efficient it is but if you can't go fast you can't go fast i don't care how sleek they make it
sw2401B-ms98-a-0075 321.472750 325.155875 it just makes sense to me It's like they're making a
sw2401B-ms98-a-0076 325.155875 329.168250 a model of a speed car when you can't go fast
sw2401B-ms98-a-0077 329.168250 334.005375 you know the in in Germany it would probably be alright if you put it on that autobahn
sw2401B-ms98-a-0078 334.005375 335.512875 [laughter]
sw2401B-ms98-a-0079 335.512875 339.952750 but over here nobody should be going that fast to be worried about wind
