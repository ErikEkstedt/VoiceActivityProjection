sw2470B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 9.046375 personal computers are are nice i guess if you can afford them the the problem if you happen to use one at work is you tend to get spoiled with the uh
sw2470B-ms98-a-0002 9.046375 18.408125 maybe a higher grade one maybe the the economics and the payback of having one at a business is a little bit better than having one at home and i've read a few articles that uh
sw2470B-ms98-a-0003 18.408125 30.765375 where people have nice uh three eighty six machines and nice graphics and the nice software packages and then when they come home they they just can't stand to come down to the X T level and and don't like the
sw2470B-ms98-a-0004 30.765375 43.715375 the slowness or the in some cases not even having a hard drive and that's pretty much where i fall into i use a a relatively nice array of machines at work for scientific purposes and i have
sw2470B-ms98-a-0005 43.715375 50.795875 a variety of of uh speeds and complexity of machines depending upon the instrument that it's controlling
sw2470B-ms98-a-0006 50.795875 59.628500 and then i have one that i do just general purpose work on and then for the house i don't have anything uh not that i wouldn't want one but i
sw2470B-ms98-a-0007 59.628500 68.451250 would probably not be satisfied with anything less than a really nice one and that's that's a quite an expense and then all the software tends to be uh
sw2470B-ms98-a-0008 68.451250 75.720500 commercial grade it's all where i guess you know to get something like WordPerfect you're looking at uh five hundred dollars worth or so
sw2470B-ms98-a-0009 75.720500 86.019375 and some of the accounting packages or the the nicer spreadsheets are somewhat expensive and i don't know it's it's quite a a
sw2470B-ms98-a-0010 86.019375 93.823375 expense or a luxury for the house i guess and there's not a whole lot i would do other than some word processing i i got a
sw2470B-ms98-a-0011 93.823375 108.012625 a number of things that i could could be doing on a PC instead of here instead of doing them at the h[ome]- at work they're for the house but i do them on occasion at work and it's nice to uh it would be nice to have one i guess what do you think

sw2470B-ms98-a-0040 372.616000 381.108125 well i tend to that's one thing i notice the speed difference in when i have a [darc/document] document that's maybe twenty or thirty pages long and i i want to 
sw2470B-ms98-a-0041 381.108125 391.737875 search through it for the spelling it takes forever on an old uh X T at at four point seven seven megahertz you know the the old old ones and we're looking at uh
sw2470B-ms98-a-0042 391.737875 402.541625 several minutes worth of time for it to go through and check everything as opposed to a three eighty six where i can just you know it flashes through there and then even just file copying i i do some of that every once in awhile and
sw2470B-ms98-a-0043 402.541625 412.095250 you know if you had thirty or forty files to copy from one place to another and you're maybe reorganizing some places on the hard drive [noise] i have an X T at work [noise] oh excuse me
sw2470B-ms98-a-0044 412.095250 420.398125 [noise] i have an X T at work that takes forever to copy and then i have a three eighty six that just you know they're they're gone they're just over there right away
sw2470B-ms98-a-0045 420.398125 431.707375 and little things like that i i've noticed the speed difference in and i do some graphics uh i haven't done any well i've done a little bit for the for the house at work but uh if i were to bring it home
sw2470B-ms98-a-0046 431.707375 444.006625 uh or have a machine at home i would like to be able to put together small uh brochure type things with the the front page being a little little bit of graphics and the inside being printed in a 
sw2470B-ms98-a-0047 444.006625 458.246875 uh what i would call a booklet form there are some editors that will produce uh the you know print it sideways and and collate it in such a way that this page comes out right so that you can fold all these eight and a half by elevens and make a little booklet and 
sw2470B-ms98-a-0048 458.246875 466.798875 my i've done that on occasion at at work and my wife does some uh teaching you know little bitty weekend type teaching for some women in the area and
sw2470B-ms98-a-0049 466.798875 479.647375 and she likes to work up little outlines and things in this format and so i do all the work for her at work and it would really be nice to be able to do it here and say is this what you want you know instead of going back and forth every day it takes us a little while to get it right
sw2470B-ms98-a-0050 479.647375 485.519875 but uh i don't know maybe someday we'll uh get around to getting something decent uh
sw2470B-ms98-a-0051 485.519875 486.987250 to bring home
