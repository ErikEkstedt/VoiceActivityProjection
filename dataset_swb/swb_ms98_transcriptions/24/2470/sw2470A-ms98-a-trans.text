sw2470A-ms98-a-0004 108.187875 123.061000 i share your your uh sense when you change job to work or job to home uh the way your your image of the machine changes i tend to do slightly different things at home than i do at work um
sw2470A-ms98-a-0005 123.061000 132.400250 i use One Two Three a lot the Lotus product as a spreadsheet and i have i use a uh
sw2470A-ms98-a-0006 132.400250 143.845500 what you see is what you get editor for almost all of my word processing so i have not although i have access at home to things like Works and WordPerfect uh
sw2470A-ms98-a-0007 143.845500 158.082375 but i i do no[t]- obviously notice it i i think the thing that surprises me most when i change work to home environment is the cursor speed and after i if initially get over the uh the cursor speed in the sense of moving linearly across the screen
sw2470A-ms98-a-0008 158.082375 160.173625 uh as opposed to tabbing
sw2470A-ms98-a-0009 160.173625 165.509500 uh i'm a touch typer and i haven't ever really noticed
sw2470A-ms98-a-0010 165.509500 175.042000 uh differences uh the machine tends to react as fast as i can i use an eight[y]- as a matter of fact use an eighty eighty eight at at home uh which is really old iron
sw2470A-ms98-a-0011 175.042000 181.991250 uh probably ten years or so and and at the office uh i am indeed using a three eighty six um
sw2470A-ms98-a-0012 181.991250 192.139750 i use a PC for a great deal of things in in private life uh i'm a church treasurer
sw2470A-ms98-a-0013 192.139750 205.227250 and i use the machine a lot on a uh uh data base and financial package that that operates at the church office i do some uh volunteer work at home using uh
sw2470A-ms98-a-0014 205.227250 217.595750 a buttons PC file program that uh is a very simplistic relational data base for labels and things so i guess i would have to say on a home setting i'm probably on
sw2470A-ms98-a-0015 217.595750 221.649625 the personal computer as much as an hour a day on average at home
sw2470A-ms98-a-0016 221.649625 225.935500 um ex[cept]- i don't have
sw2470A-ms98-a-0017 225.935500 236.019500 a concern too much about the speed however because most of the applications i find are as fast as i am if not more so and i tend to notice it more when it
sw2470A-ms98-a-0018 236.019500 248.412250 comes down to an issue of peripherals uh at work i'm used to various batch printing capabilities and uh pretty high-speed output either laser printer uh
sw2470A-ms98-a-0019 248.412250 253.472125 or uh machines like uh IBM thirty eight twenty high speed
sw2470A-ms98-a-0020 253.472125 266.588250 uh APA printers and so i get frustrated uh watching things slowly come out upon my matrix printer more so than i do over over access speed um
sw2470A-ms98-a-0021 266.588250 268.429750 i
sw2470A-ms98-a-0022 268.429750 270.416000 [silence]
sw2470A-ms98-a-0023 270.416000 275.872750 guess that i have gotten to the point where if if i didn't have the personal computer
sw2470A-ms98-a-0024 275.872750 286.502250 i would be impacted a great deal on the things that i do in my life i'm i'm sure i would probably find ways to return to what i was doing in nineteen eighty one when i
sw2470A-ms98-a-0025 286.502250 292.871250 got my first home computer but i[t]- it would be i think a d[ramatic]- a dramatic sense of loss on on some items
sw2470A-ms98-a-0026 292.871250 299.200875 [silence]
sw2470A-ms98-a-0027 299.200875 306.317375 uh no i have access to uh spell correction uh material i s[eldom]-
sw2470A-ms98-a-0028 306.317375 319.454250 i seldom use it although when i'm at the office and i'm producing work correspondence uh i i run about ninety per cent of my office work on a mainframe
sw2470A-ms98-a-0029 319.454250 328.457250 uh i i execute on a three eighty six machine that is attached to the mainframe as a s[erver]- as a intelligent work station but i use it
sw2470A-ms98-a-0030 328.457250 337.263000 frequently as a dumbhead to get to the mainframe and and there i tend on almost all of my editing and stuff to to be using some fairly powerful
sw2470A-ms98-a-0031 337.263000 348.055750 editors and word processors and and wordproof but surprisingly at home and i seldom ever bother uh or worry about it too much uh
sw2470A-ms98-a-0032 348.055750 356.785750 i guess ultimately i'm not a a horribly bad speller although i have a tendency to lisp when i type so to speak uh 
sw2470A-ms98-a-0033 356.785750 366.771000 nothing that that's particularly horrible and i think most of the work word processing i do since it's somewhat of a personal nature i've probably don't have a sense of vulnerability 
sw2470A-ms98-a-0034 366.771000 373.191500 in this i[n]- in the even that i were to s[end]- to to send a a misspelled word out the way one might have at the office place
sw2470A-ms98-a-0035 373.191500 379.634500 [silence]
sw2470A-ms98-a-0036 379.634500 381.137750 uh

sw2470A-ms98-a-0038 419.069875 420.972500 okay
sw2470A-ms98-a-0039 420.972500 450.522625 [silence]
sw2470A-ms98-a-0040 450.522625 451.912000 right
sw2470A-ms98-a-0041 451.912000 481.465125 [silence]
sw2470A-ms98-a-0042 481.465125 482.984250 that's
sw2470A-ms98-a-0043 482.984250 485.496625 [silence]
sw2470A-ms98-a-0044 485.496625 491.186625 that's an interesting point i think a the more i as i've thought about
sw2470A-ms98-a-0045 491.186625 505.953000 our conversation i realize that one of the things that perhaps causes me not to get a jarring difference between the two locations is that at the office i'm doing work things that in some ways are dissimilar from what i do at home
sw2470A-ms98-a-0046 505.953000 510.799250 uh and as a result i don't get the comparative feel
sw2470A-ms98-a-0047 510.799250 525.538750 uh i suspect if i were coming home and trying to do some of the projects i do at the office i would go crazy on my on my machine uh i haven't tended to play the games and and uh do the applications at work that i do at home so i probably have never been in
sw2470A-ms98-a-0048 525.538750 535.971625 noticed how wonderful it might be uh i suspect Lotus One Two Three and spreadsheet application might be the one common thread
sw2470A-ms98-a-0049 535.971625 542.741625 um and there i think that even though i'm on an eighty eighty eight at home
sw2470A-ms98-a-0050 542.741625 555.100875 that the speed is really quite adequate uh and and i consequently don't even really notice uh the the difference between the the fast machine and and the eighty eighty eight
sw2470A-ms98-a-0051 555.100875 556.599500 [silence]
sw2470A-ms98-a-0052 556.599500 570.290125 right right i i do have some uh retirement modeling that i've done at home that uh tends to crawl uh which on which i've just turned the calculation off in between and a couple of models that i've
sw2470A-ms98-a-0053 570.290125 582.442500 built uh f[or]- for school purposes that i start in the evening and then go to bed and get them the next morning but they would have run an hour and a half even on a thirty three eighty six machine i imagine so
sw2470A-ms98-a-0054 582.442500 593.608625 i suspect that what happens is that uh you get to the point where it's so long that uh from a human being perspective there's not much difference between six hours and an hour and a half
sw2470A-ms98-a-0055 593.608625 595.021000 um
sw2470A-ms98-a-0056 595.021000 599.721750 [silence]
