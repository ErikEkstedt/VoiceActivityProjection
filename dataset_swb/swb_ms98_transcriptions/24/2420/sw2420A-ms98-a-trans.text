sw2420A-ms98-a-0016 71.700750 79.549875 the Kurdish in the northern part of Iraq unfortunately when the the uh Mid Eastern countries were
sw2420A-ms98-a-0017 79.549875 92.510000 when the boundaries were adjusted and changed and all the Kurdish were basically forgotten because there's a group of Kurdish in Northern Iraq there's some in uh Western Iran and there's some in Southern Turkey
sw2420A-ms98-a-0018 92.510000 94.613750 and uh

sw2420A-ms98-a-0022 104.458875 110.361500 yeah it it's just unfortunate that the Kurdish people didn't get their own uh
sw2420A-ms98-a-0023 110.361500 114.555500 [vocalized-noise] well their their own government or their own
sw2420A-ms98-a-0024 114.555500 117.134750 something originally

sw2420A-ms98-a-0028 132.088000 136.652125 yeah they've they've got plenty of problems without the Iraqi problem
sw2420A-ms98-a-0029 136.652125 140.559125 [silence]
sw2420A-ms98-a-0030 140.559125 146.399125 the the Iranian borders are still open uh from what i under[stand]- understand um
sw2420A-ms98-a-0031 146.399125 159.751125 the Iraqis the Kurdish are going into Ira[n]- to Iran and into Syria i know that the S[audi]- the uh that Saudi Arabia has some pretty strict
sw2420A-ms98-a-0032 159.751125 161.215000 uh
sw2420A-ms98-a-0033 161.215000 163.649625 [silence]
sw2420A-ms98-a-0034 163.649625 164.985750 yeah
sw2420A-ms98-a-0035 164.985750 168.407750 and i doubt that they're letting too many Iraqis in
sw2420A-ms98-a-0036 168.407750 173.402625 unless the people have proof that they're leaving that they're not going to stay
sw2420A-ms98-a-0037 173.402625 187.028750 [silence]
sw2420A-ms98-a-0038 187.028750 189.405000 then the Saudi Arabians will just shoot them_1
sw2420A-ms98-a-0039 189.405000 197.464625 [silence]
sw2420A-ms98-a-0040 197.464625 201.674750 well they it's a it's all the countries over there are very wealthy
sw2420A-ms98-a-0041 201.674750 211.895375 and so most of the people are wealthy and and they don't have some most of their basic needs for for food and shelter and clothing are met so they don't have any
sw2420A-ms98-a-0042 211.895375 218.960500 uh any need that's going to drive them to to petty theft or or to that type of crime
sw2420A-ms98-a-0043 218.960500 222.891250 [silence]
sw2420A-ms98-a-0044 222.891250 231.034375 yeah but those uh those countries are so extremely wealthy but from what i understand though that it's pri[vate]-
sw2420A-ms98-a-0045 231.034375 236.495625 it's the same type of wealth distribution where you have a the very few are very wealthy
sw2420A-ms98-a-0046 236.495625 237.544500 [silence]
sw2420A-ms98-a-0047 237.544500 242.908625 but since there's so much more to go around that that leaves the the lower classes with more
sw2420A-ms98-a-0048 242.908625 247.330750 [silence]
sw2420A-ms98-a-0049 247.330750 248.549000 yeah
sw2420A-ms98-a-0050 248.549000 251.769625 [silence]
sw2420A-ms98-a-0051 251.769625 259.469875 so you think that that George Bush's foreign policy is poor because of because of what's happening to the Kurdish people
sw2420A-ms98-a-0052 259.469875 277.737625 [silence]
sw2420A-ms98-a-0053 277.737625 284.076250 something else done here that would would solve the problems in the Mid East or or
sw2420A-ms98-a-0054 284.076250 292.751000 [silence]
sw2420A-ms98-a-0055 292.751000 298.503250 no other than than reestablishing the dominance of the United States in the in the world e[conomy]-
sw2420A-ms98-a-0056 298.503250 303.961875 [silence]
sw2420A-ms98-a-0057 303.961875 317.018375 another thing that was good if you're looking at the balance of the super powers between the United States and the Soviet Union you know the United States went in and led the battle and and solved the problem and the Soviet Union is is a whimpering
sw2420A-ms98-a-0058 317.018375 322.413750 is a whimpering country right now because they they've got so many problems that they can't even
sw2420A-ms98-a-0059 322.413750 323.418875 [silence]
sw2420A-ms98-a-0060 323.418875 325.372125 yeah yeah

sw2420A-ms98-a-0062 331.451750 336.411500 a lot of their their civil problems where they've got their uh Baltic states
sw2420A-ms98-a-0063 336.411500 341.782750 rising against the the uh the leadership in in the Russian state
sw2420A-ms98-a-0064 341.782750 348.551625 uh is the same type of deal as what occurred with the Kurdish people it's the same type of situation where
sw2420A-ms98-a-0065 348.551625 361.936750 where where ethnic groups were split up and and our and don't necessarily have the same uh social structure or value systems as the government
sw2420A-ms98-a-0066 361.936750 364.193500 [silence]
sw2420A-ms98-a-0067 364.193500 372.697500 it's i it's it's kind of fortunate that that the United States was founded in the way that it did because it's such a mixture of people
sw2420A-ms98-a-0068 372.697500 376.655750 with with for the most part with the same ideals

sw2420A-ms98-a-0074 391.219625 395.992375 and and when the when the United States was founded the people
sw2420A-ms98-a-0075 395.992375 407.714500 the people who founded the country all had the same value systems and beliefs and so immigrants coming in understood that and and it wasn't as if it was forced upon them_1 they chose to come to this country
sw2420A-ms98-a-0076 407.714500 413.389250 it wasn't as if a a new government was established when they were already here
sw2420A-ms98-a-0077 413.389250 414.912500 [silence]
sw2420A-ms98-a-0078 414.912500 416.161000 so
