sw2453B-ms98-a-0002 1.009250 4.233375 well how do you think women's roles have changed
sw2453B-ms98-a-0003 4.233375 21.578875 [silence]
sw2453B-ms98-a-0004 21.578875 24.465375 uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh
sw2453B-ms98-a-0005 24.465375 38.506125 [silence]
sw2453B-ms98-a-0006 38.506125 49.586625 well i i uh just in my lifetime i know that the role of women has changed drastically also my mother when she began having her family she quit her job and stayed home until
sw2453B-ms98-a-0007 49.586625 56.595250 i'm the youngest in my family until i was uh in junior high school old enough to care for myself when i got home first from school
sw2453B-ms98-a-0008 56.595250 69.507000 but i think that uh the changes in the next twenty years will probably be just as drastic you you'll see more women CEOs and more more women holding public offices
sw2453B-ms98-a-0009 69.507000 76.115750 [silence]
sw2453B-ms98-a-0010 76.115750 78.235625 oh i agree [laughter]
sw2453B-ms98-a-0011 78.235625 80.604875 [silence]
sw2453B-ms98-a-0012 80.604875 81.697750 yeah
sw2453B-ms98-a-0013 81.697750 89.464750 [silence]
sw2453B-ms98-a-0014 89.464750 93.055125 it it's probably all it it's
sw2453B-ms98-a-0015 93.055125 103.716000 the role of women is is in an evolutionary stage so we i'm sure it will eventually evolve to where it is equal it just hasn't reached that point yet because women uh haven't
sw2453B-ms98-a-0016 103.716000 111.023375 uh been in positions similar to men for that many years relative to how long men have had those types of positions
sw2453B-ms98-a-0017 111.023375 135.362125 [silence]
sw2453B-ms98-a-0018 135.362125 137.351375 no it's not fair

sw2453B-ms98-a-0020 138.982125 145.463750 [laughter] well there's not much you can do except for yourself individually and and stand up for
sw2453B-ms98-a-0021 145.463750 153.408250 your salary i mean for what you want in your own job and if if it's not going to work out go find some place that will do what you want to do
sw2453B-ms98-a-0022 153.408250 202.995625 [silence]
sw2453B-ms98-a-0023 202.995625 204.158375 uh-huh

sw2453B-ms98-a-0025 206.317750 213.212125 well i think it [noise] during this in this evolutionary theory that i have here that men will eventually
sw2453B-ms98-a-0026 213.212125 226.941875 evolve around to where they participate more in the home because when it gets to the point to where tha[t]- the house is dirty and the kids are dirty and and mom's not home she's at work men are going to gradually learn how to do those kinds of things
sw2453B-ms98-a-0027 226.941875 230.874750 [silence]
sw2453B-ms98-a-0028 230.874750 238.246625 well at i the the the generations that are being raised now by working mothers i i are are a little more in touch with
sw2453B-ms98-a-0029 238.246625 251.535000 the household chores and duties and what has to be done so i think over a couple of generations time it will all change because it's really been uh my generation i'm twenty five and and my generation
sw2453B-ms98-a-0030 251.535000 261.188000 grew up for the most part with mothers in the home but again my generation plan of women plans on working and not being at home
sw2453B-ms98-a-0031 261.188000 269.968625 so it will be my children who really make big changes i think because that they will probably the majority of children
sw2453B-ms98-a-0032 269.968625 277.983500 now are at home without their mothers well or or in some type of a day care or something because so many women work now

sw2453B-ms98-a-0039 306.673000 315.736500 we[ll]- how do you feel about women in public office do you think that that's going to grow and and a[nd]- how far do you think that's going to go in the next ten years or so
sw2453B-ms98-a-0040 315.736500 324.414125 [silence]
sw2453B-ms98-a-0041 324.414125 325.482875 uh-huh

sw2453B-ms98-a-0045 351.986500 361.155125 i don't know any statistics either but it's it's probably going to be the same type of situation that that uh the black people have gone through it took them
sw2453B-ms98-a-0046 361.155125 371.986500 [vocalized-noise] well black men [noise] a long time to to get up to the pay scales of the white man and now i think it it's feasible for a black man to be president
sw2453B-ms98-a-0047 371.986500 375.931125 [silence]
sw2453B-ms98-a-0048 375.931125 388.610375 uh-huh and si[nce]- since this evolution or this this progression of black male salaries and all that was all before women were heavy in the work place i women will probably go through the same
sw2453B-ms98-a-0049 388.610375 392.005250 type of deal it's just further down the road
sw2453B-ms98-a-0050 392.005250 397.335375 [silence]

sw2453B-ms98-a-0085 519.350750 532.379125 i uh i just i don't think a woman president is anywhere in the near future if not just for the just for American prejudice but
sw2453B-ms98-a-0086 532.379125 543.333250 the world several major countries in the world that we deal with all the time don't respect women as business people so a woman president would be
sw2453B-ms98-a-0087 543.333250 548.029125 laughed at by other countries because they wouldn't respect her as a business person
sw2453B-ms98-a-0088 548.029125 548.754875 [noise]

sw2453B-ms98-a-0090 554.100625 560.201000 she was but i don't think that England deals as heavily with with
sw2453B-ms98-a-0091 560.201000 571.013625 like for instance the Arab countries um i don't know all the details of it but i i know that for instance in Saudi Arabia women are just 
sw2453B-ms98-a-0092 571.013625 581.143625 and in uh my mother has done business in Germany and it was very difficult for her going over there because they just don't have very many business women
sw2453B-ms98-a-0093 581.143625 595.647375 and and the men basically see a business woman and ask them to go get coffee or something it's just it's very difficult to be well respected and and Margaret Margaret Thatcher had been in office it was probably very difficult for her at first but
sw2453B-ms98-a-0094 595.647375 599.925000 well she comes from a a country where the mo[del]-
