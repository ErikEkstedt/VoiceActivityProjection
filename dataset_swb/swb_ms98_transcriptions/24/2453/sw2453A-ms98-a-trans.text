sw2453A-ms98-a-0003 3.603250 12.309500 well that kind of caught me by surprise it's kind i think i think that they have changed drastically i mean i think about people like my mother who
sw2453A-ms98-a-0004 12.309500 17.066375 you know gave up their careers and stayed home to raise kids and um
sw2453A-ms98-a-0005 17.066375 23.394375 you know played a really subservient role in the family and i just don't see that anymore at all
sw2453A-ms98-a-0006 23.394375 36.885625 even women who do stay home to raise families i think that they are still thought of as equals in in the r[ole]- you know as far as the role in the family and society goes
sw2453A-ms98-a-0007 36.885625 48.169750 [silence]
sw2453A-ms98-a-0008 48.169750 49.733875 uh-huh

sw2453A-ms98-a-0010 54.348250 55.594500 um

sw2453A-ms98-a-0012 62.354375 64.014250 yeah
sw2453A-ms98-a-0013 64.014250 65.503000 [silence]
sw2453A-ms98-a-0014 65.503000 67.350500 definitely
sw2453A-ms98-a-0015 67.350500 69.304500 [silence]
sw2453A-ms98-a-0016 69.304500 77.249250 i think the biggest problem uh the biggest change that needs to be made is the way that women are paid
sw2453A-ms98-a-0017 77.249250 90.654750 i mean you know it's just the statistics are just staggering you know that when they make like you know sixty cents on the dollar for what men make for the same jobs and tha[t]- i mean i can get really angry about that
sw2453A-ms98-a-0018 90.654750 100.398000 [silence]
sw2453A-ms98-a-0019 100.398000 101.728875 yeah
sw2453A-ms98-a-0020 101.728875 107.870875 [silence]
sw2453A-ms98-a-0021 107.870875 109.519000 well
sw2453A-ms98-a-0022 109.519000 111.538000 that's true
sw2453A-ms98-a-0023 111.538000 125.318500 but you know i'm a single parent trying to raise a child and it really upsets me not to be paid you know the same for my job now i don't see that so much in my job but i know in other professions
sw2453A-ms98-a-0024 125.318500 131.004875 um i know that it's true i know you know friends of mine that are affected by that
sw2453A-ms98-a-0025 131.004875 135.961000 and uh just you know it's just not [laughter-fair]
sw2453A-ms98-a-0026 135.961000 137.498750 [silence]
sw2453A-ms98-a-0027 137.498750 139.993000 i don't know what to do about it
sw2453A-ms98-a-0028 139.993000 150.894375 [silence]
sw2453A-ms98-a-0029 150.894375 154.150375 yeah yeah
sw2453A-ms98-a-0030 154.150375 156.596750 and then too i think that
sw2453A-ms98-a-0031 156.596750 166.661750 you know i think a lot of women who have been forced into the workplace unwittingly just because it you know to raise a family nowadays it it takes two incomes
sw2453A-ms98-a-0032 166.661750 176.292375 they have to work and then i think the majority of the time they get still get stuck with most of the you know running the house type chores
sw2453A-ms98-a-0033 176.292375 182.266625 you know taking care of the kids and you know arranging their schedules and
sw2453A-ms98-a-0034 182.266625 195.380500 being responsible for those types of of things i know that i do know some men that that participate quite actively um you know in in things but i know a lot that don't so
sw2453A-ms98-a-0035 195.380500 205.755625 it's just a real shame you know i think when you look at the changing role of women you have to look at the changing role of men too because they're directly related
sw2453A-ms98-a-0036 205.755625 215.629500 [silence]
sw2453A-ms98-a-0037 215.629500 217.136000 yeah

sw2453A-ms98-a-0041 225.174375 231.525625 well they may yeah i think eventually but some men don't see some men just don't care
sw2453A-ms98-a-0042 231.525625 235.345500 [silence]

sw2453A-ms98-a-0053 278.527500 289.843375 yeah i agree i uh you know it's fu[n]- being single it's like i almost have to work right now i'm at home because i am recovering from surgery but uh
sw2453A-ms98-a-0054 289.843375 296.118875 you know i really resent that in that i don't have that choice to be able to stay home with my child
sw2453A-ms98-a-0055 296.118875 298.111625 [silence]
sw2453A-ms98-a-0056 298.111625 305.640125 but uh i guess as long as you are single you [laughter-have] [laughter-to] support yourself nobody else is going to do it for you
sw2453A-ms98-a-0057 305.640125 307.892250 so
sw2453A-ms98-a-0058 307.892250 314.445250 [silence]
sw2453A-ms98-a-0059 314.445250 329.254875 well i think that that there's more you know there is definitely more women in public office uh i think it's going to be a long time before we see a woman president uh i don't think that's going to happen in the next ten years i don't
sw2453A-ms98-a-0060 329.254875 338.324125 think that's going to happen in the [laughter-next] twenty years but uh you know i think that there's progress
sw2453A-ms98-a-0061 338.324125 351.522500 and i'm not very political so i don't really know you know any i don't know any statistics on you know how many women run for public office and how often they're defeated
sw2453A-ms98-a-0062 351.522500 362.679500 [silence]
sw2453A-ms98-a-0063 362.679500 364.160875 yeah

sw2453A-ms98-a-0065 370.818625 377.527750 yeah i think we will see a black a black man as president before we see a woman president
sw2453A-ms98-a-0066 377.527750 383.709000 [silence]
sw2453A-ms98-a-0067 383.709000 385.141875 uh-huh

sw2453A-ms98-a-0069 388.384500 391.404750 same type of battle yeah
sw2453A-ms98-a-0070 391.404750 404.005375 yeah uh i don't know i think a lot of um states are uh do you live in Texas you know because we have now we have a woman governor and of course Dallas i do you live in Dallas
sw2453A-ms98-a-0071 404.005375 406.618250 in San Antonio well
sw2453A-ms98-a-0072 406.618250 418.108500 do yeah yeah you do now [laughter] and uh we have a woman mayor now too in Dallas and Houston has had a woman mayor for a long time because i used to live there too

sw2453A-ms98-a-0074 419.825750 421.589875 oh did they
sw2453A-ms98-a-0075 421.589875 423.756375 oh i didn't know that
sw2453A-ms98-a-0076 423.756375 424.975625 huh
sw2453A-ms98-a-0077 424.975625 426.206375 [silence]
sw2453A-ms98-a-0078 426.206375 430.167750 was she elected or was it something that

sw2453A-ms98-a-0085 447.385000 458.769500 yeah that's ri[ght]- why i asked if she was elected or if it if it was something that was passed passed down to her through through the ways that the laws work
sw2453A-ms98-a-0086 458.769500 460.484625 but
sw2453A-ms98-a-0087 460.484625 470.552125 uh i'm surprised i really am surprised you know that major cities you know especially in a state like Texas would elect a woman governor
sw2453A-ms98-a-0088 470.552125 479.202250 and uh like i said i really have no [laughter-interest] in politics it's just not my field but uh
sw2453A-ms98-a-0089 479.202250 485.293000 [noise] you know being a woman i don't know even that i would vote
sw2453A-ms98-a-0090 485.293000 488.528750 for a woman in the high office
sw2453A-ms98-a-0091 488.528750 492.707375 [silence]
sw2453A-ms98-a-0092 492.707375 503.729000 i certainly i wouldn't have voted for [laughter-Ann] [laughter-Richards] for [laughter-governor] and uh i can't say that i would vote for a woman president now
sw2453A-ms98-a-0093 503.729000 518.289500 we might see a woman vice president that wouldn't surprise me and then of course if something happened to be uh [vocalized-noise] if something happened she would be president but it would not be something that she were elected to
sw2453A-ms98-a-0094 518.289500 531.120250 [silence]
