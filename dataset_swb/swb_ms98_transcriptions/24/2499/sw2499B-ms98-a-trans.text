sw2499B-ms98-a-0054 206.650625 216.386500 like cutesy it's just uh it's just so realistic everything they do you wonder how in the world they ever got them to do some of these things and it was
sw2499B-ms98-a-0055 216.386500 228.816375 a real dog and cat and all the other animals they initially start out in the barnyard kind of setting where they're raised and then the cat gets um on this treacherous journey he climbs into a box and ends up floating down this river and he winds up
sw2499B-ms98-a-0056 228.816375 234.001625 all over creation i don't know where in the world it is somewhere in China somewhere i think that it was filmed
