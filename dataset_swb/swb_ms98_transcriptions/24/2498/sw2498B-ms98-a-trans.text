sw2498B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 3.183000 [silence]
sw2498B-ms98-a-0002 3.183000 12.174125 well um the budget's an interesting issue uh particularly since i'm pretty much a libertarian and an {anachro} libertarian at that
sw2498B-ms98-a-0003 12.174125 24.251125 uh so i would basically say the way to fix the budget is to uh cut and eliminate taxes charge user fees for things that uh are absolutely necessary and to be allocated fairly that way
sw2498B-ms98-a-0004 24.251125 28.513875 and um i'd say ninety percent of the budget has no business being there
sw2498B-ms98-a-0005 28.513875 39.390750 [silence]
sw2498B-ms98-a-0006 39.390750 40.743375 uh-huh
sw2498B-ms98-a-0007 40.743375 46.520000 yeah i th[ink]- i think a lot of people fail to realize but you know the government doesn't generate money
sw2498B-ms98-a-0008 46.520000 54.687250 you know they may print it but that's not really the way money is made it's it's made from people working and doing things that are productive and government's the net cost
sw2498B-ms98-a-0009 54.687250 56.886875 [silence]
sw2498B-ms98-a-0010 56.886875 58.477000 that's right
sw2498B-ms98-a-0011 58.477000 62.277500 so uh a dollar tax isn't isn't a dollar that can be
sw2498B-ms98-a-0012 62.277500 67.730625 you know that that makes more bread or anything else it's uh it's lost
sw2498B-ms98-a-0013 67.730625 76.557500 [silence]
sw2498B-ms98-a-0014 76.557500 78.020000 uh-huh
sw2498B-ms98-a-0015 78.020000 81.139625 [silence]
sw2498B-ms98-a-0016 81.139625 82.396625 uh-huh
sw2498B-ms98-a-0017 82.396625 85.172125 [silence]
sw2498B-ms98-a-0018 85.172125 86.676500 absolutely
sw2498B-ms98-a-0019 86.676500 93.389000 yeah i mean it's it's real easy when you go home and and you think gee you know i'd like to have a mansion and a yacht isn't it nice i can make my neighbors pay for it
sw2498B-ms98-a-0020 93.389000 94.733000 [laughter]
sw2498B-ms98-a-0021 94.733000 102.133500 but but uh you know i mean the real world doesn't work like that or at least it shouldn't but it seems to in government
sw2498B-ms98-a-0022 102.133500 135.185750 [silence]
sw2498B-ms98-a-0023 135.185750 137.684000 hum oh that's right
sw2498B-ms98-a-0024 137.684000 139.286125 that's right
sw2498B-ms98-a-0025 139.286125 152.700750 [silence]
sw2498B-ms98-a-0026 152.700750 161.045625 uh-huh well even just the general funding for the arts uh in humanities and then you know they get into these censorship issues and everything else i mean
sw2498B-ms98-a-0027 161.045625 163.664750 the art's in humanity should be privately funded
sw2498B-ms98-a-0028 163.664750 174.084500 um a lot of these social welfare programs i mean that's why they're things like United Way is when you and i think that those are important but we give our dollars to them and it shouldn't be a government responsibility
sw2498B-ms98-a-0029 174.084500 179.985250 but the government i think is supposed to be doing is is defending our rights
sw2498B-ms98-a-0030 179.985250 182.343250 no more and no less
sw2498B-ms98-a-0031 182.343250 186.118125 [silence]

sw2498B-ms98-a-0039 210.093500 214.376500 but Congress never really had the right to give it to them is the is the real argument
sw2498B-ms98-a-0040 214.376500 220.409500 um yeah it's it's so i don't know i mean so it i mean getting back to the budget it's
sw2498B-ms98-a-0041 220.409500 221.599875 [silence]
sw2498B-ms98-a-0042 221.599875 225.699250 i guess the the fundamental thing is to
sw2498B-ms98-a-0043 225.699250 235.812500 give people a concrete get people to agree on a concrete idea of just exactly what government is supposed to be doing for them no more no less and cut government back down to that size
