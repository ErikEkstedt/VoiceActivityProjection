sw2421B-ms98-a-0002 2.667125 13.090500 well um i guess i i'm more concerned about public safety than i am about the um the concern for [vocalized-noise]
sw2421B-ms98-a-0003 13.090500 23.481375 the private uh the idea of preserving privacy for the individual um because i can't really see why anyone
sw2421B-ms98-a-0004 23.481375 27.537500 um who has nothing to hide would object
sw2421B-ms98-a-0005 27.537500 34.947375 [silence]
sw2421B-ms98-a-0006 34.947375 38.127125 that's of course that is certainly true yeah

sw2421B-ms98-a-0012 52.887125 54.096000 uh-huh

sw2421B-ms98-a-0016 59.167000 61.224625 if you had to have a drug test yeah
sw2421B-ms98-a-0017 61.224625 62.505000 [silence]
sw2421B-ms98-a-0018 62.505000 64.017375 um-hum

sw2421B-ms98-a-0021 78.999750 79.956750 [noise]
sw2421B-ms98-a-0022 79.956750 91.241125 checked out or whatever i but it seems to me that there are ways to accommodate that um i agree that that some innocent person might be victimized by a false test 
sw2421B-ms98-a-0023 91.241125 100.243125 but i would think that um that some guidelines could be set up to avoid that for example that one uh positive
sw2421B-ms98-a-0024 100.243125 105.030625 would not be uh accepted as an automatic um
sw2421B-ms98-a-0025 105.030625 111.666500 reason for whatever they might be going to do if they found a positive uh dismissal or treatment or whatever 
sw2421B-ms98-a-0026 111.666500 120.135125 but that that what it would do is it would trigger perhaps uh one or two more stages where further tests could be ta[ken]- uh done
sw2421B-ms98-a-0027 120.135125 132.691500 because um there are there must be people like you or in other circumstances that could come up with with uh false positives for certain kind of drugs on the other hand um
sw2421B-ms98-a-0028 132.691500 136.971125 i think there's certainly some professions that ought to be tested
sw2421B-ms98-a-0029 136.971125 150.218500 because of the of their responsibility for the public welfare and certainly people in uh industries well the transportation industry for spe[cifically]- uh you know specifically but um in many many cases
sw2421B-ms98-a-0030 150.218500 159.365500 whether or not an individual has a problem with drugs it's not even going to effect anybody but his uh you know himself and his own family perhaps um
sw2421B-ms98-a-0031 159.365500 165.296875 depending on the kind of drug he might be on but um and eventually that's going to show up anyway
sw2421B-ms98-a-0032 165.296875 170.078875 in the way he works and so on but there's so many things that it would make a difference i guess i
sw2421B-ms98-a-0033 170.078875 182.810625 i uh i would not want to have anyone in my family uh victimized by someone who you know a a bus driver or a train engineer or something like that who um [vocalized-noise] you know hadn't been tested 
sw2421B-ms98-a-0034 182.810625 188.092000 [silence]
sw2421B-ms98-a-0035 188.092000 189.816125 yeah

sw2421B-ms98-a-0045 217.891625 220.016625 make it difficult enough

sw2421B-ms98-a-0049 226.081000 237.432500 yeah according to what you you hear the people who um have serious problems i mean we have um really i guess we're kind of lucky we really only know of one um
sw2421B-ms98-a-0050 237.432500 244.381125 young man who uh who's a fam[ily]- they go to our church and it's the son and so on and he was friends with my children
sw2421B-ms98-a-0051 244.381125 252.816375 um and he's really the only one that i know of personally who got himself really messed up um ha[ving]- having been involved with drugs but
sw2421B-ms98-a-0052 252.816375 265.178750 i know of a number of other people who have you know gotten all messed up most of these are young people i work in the education system and so i have a little more contact with that but um
sw2421B-ms98-a-0053 265.178750 274.003125 the effect that it's had on this young man's life is so dramatic that it's heartbreaking and he may never really be
sw2421B-ms98-a-0054 274.003125 281.504375 a productive member of society But sadder than that he may never be able to have a normal happy life
sw2421B-ms98-a-0055 281.504375 291.532875 because it has strung him out so that he has anxieties now that are are almost uncontrollable i mean he he puts himself in the hospital
sw2421B-ms98-a-0056 291.532875 297.554750 fairly [laughter-regularly] thinking that you know he he's not sure if he's going try to commit suicide or not
sw2421B-ms98-a-0057 297.554750 299.686875 i mean he's you know he's so messed up
sw2421B-ms98-a-0058 299.686875 310.330000 and um this was a nice sweet young man who teenager you know and he's now a young man about twenty i guess who um just got
sw2421B-ms98-a-0059 310.330000 319.090750 really down the wrong path and uh you know i don't know that that his problem would ever have been detected by drug testing
sw2421B-ms98-a-0060 319.090750 327.401625 but seeing what drugs did to him makes me see makes me realize what it could do to people you know in the work force as well
sw2421B-ms98-a-0061 327.401625 329.510625 um it's horrible
sw2421B-ms98-a-0062 329.510625 334.512375 [silence]
sw2421B-ms98-a-0063 334.512375 343.140875 well the limits uh uh would i think have to do with what i'd alluded to before that there needs to be a further um
sw2421B-ms98-a-0064 343.140875 346.826250 that that one positive on a drug test would not
sw2421B-ms98-a-0065 346.826250 353.309250 constitute uh dismissal or grounds for whatever the company or agency might
sw2421B-ms98-a-0066 353.309250 359.850375 uh have set up for those who genuinely have a problem in other words there needs to be um more than
sw2421B-ms98-a-0067 359.850375 365.604500 pard[on]- yes right there needs to be more than one test and there needs to be some
sw2421B-ms98-a-0068 365.604500 375.521625 some measure of uh certainty before anything drastic happens there are lots of things that are involved there um such as perhaps insurance
sw2421B-ms98-a-0069 375.521625 384.154500 uh you know denial of insurance for someone um and undoubtedly there are people who would be victimized by this um
sw2421B-ms98-a-0070 384.154500 390.552500 that would that you know it would be unfair and people who are on medication for example or um
sw2421B-ms98-a-0071 390.552500 399.612250 e[ven]- even people who might be of the gay community and i'm not an advocate for that particular [laughter] segment of society but um i think that
sw2421B-ms98-a-0072 399.612250 405.822000 there doesn't need to be fuel to the fire for discrimination because it makes a bigger problem
sw2421B-ms98-a-0073 405.822000 414.134625 um so it seems to me that that um there needs to be some ground you know some rules that protect
sw2421B-ms98-a-0074 414.134625 424.327750 i'm not sure though when we talk about what rules if any that we should say well certain segments should not have to be tested i really don't see why
sw2421B-ms98-a-0075 424.327750 425.937250 [silence]
sw2421B-ms98-a-0076 425.937250 427.197750 and

sw2421B-ms98-a-0078 428.370125 429.381375 [silence]
sw2421B-ms98-a-0079 429.381375 433.899875 yeah i don't i don't know why it would be you know um
sw2421B-ms98-a-0080 433.899875 442.537375 bad to test just every[one]- and it may be you know it's not feasible to do everyone but certainly random testing the fact that people know that that they
sw2421B-ms98-a-0081 442.537375 451.110625 yeah would be some measure of protection but the bottom line is that that if if you're going to [laughter-stay] [laughter-clean] [laughter-and] [laughter-straight] then um
sw2421B-ms98-a-0082 451.110625 454.908375 you're you're going to do that because you want to really
sw2421B-ms98-a-0083 454.908375 464.032125 [silence]
sw2421B-ms98-a-0084 464.032125 465.598625 yeah

sw2421B-ms98-a-0086 467.229750 469.119625 no that's very true

sw2421B-ms98-a-0088 470.134125 471.769750 well it sounds like we agree anyway

sw2421B-ms98-a-0092 476.390625 479.796125 i guess if that's all we've done and i guess we've talked long enough
sw2421B-ms98-a-0093 479.796125 481.770500 it was nice talking to you
sw2421B-ms98-a-0094 481.770500 483.593500 okay bye-bye
