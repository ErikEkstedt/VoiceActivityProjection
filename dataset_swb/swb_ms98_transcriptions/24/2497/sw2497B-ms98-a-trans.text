sw2497B-ms98-a-0055 274.003000 281.217125 yeah and and even changing the things i mean first off [vocalized-noise] i i mean you you need to address do you even need to change the signs
sw2497B-ms98-a-0056 281.217125 290.443875 because for so long people are going are going to be able to equate miles to kilometers i mean when you drive around Europe you do the same thing
sw2497B-ms98-a-0057 290.443875 295.625500 [silence]
sw2497B-ms98-a-0058 295.625500 305.787375 yeah most of them do they have the uh yeah they have the the kilometer inside and the and of course the miles per hour great big so you can see it um
sw2497B-ms98-a-0059 305.787375 316.686250 yeah i i i it's silly i don't i don't think that we ought to be any different it causes a lot of problems a lot of times between uh different countries in their manufacturing stuff and
sw2497B-ms98-a-0060 316.686250 326.882750 [silence]
sw2497B-ms98-a-0061 326.882750 337.896875 well you know even even uh interstate signs and stuff you you can reprint the number of kilometers on the on that reflective uh stick on tape stuff that they use to uh
sw2497B-ms98-a-0062 337.896875 346.016125 uh stick on those things and they can ju[st]- all that's all they have to do i mean that wouldn't cost a great deal of money and uh
sw2497B-ms98-a-0063 346.016125 352.050375 i i i just don't see any problems with it i think it's just uh obstinate Americanism
sw2497B-ms98-a-0064 352.050375 356.539625 [silence]
sw2497B-ms98-a-0065 356.539625 357.979000 uh-huh

sw2497B-ms98-a-0069 374.473500 377.598250 exactly right i mean i mean
sw2497B-ms98-a-0070 377.598250 386.232750 [vocalized-noise] i- i can think of one for instance you take a you take a textile industry and they're selling stuff by the by the yard
sw2497B-ms98-a-0071 386.232750 392.056000 you know now now there's a big difference between a yard and a meter when you're talking about fabric
sw2497B-ms98-a-0072 392.056000 394.125125 [laughter] i don't
sw2497B-ms98-a-0073 394.125125 399.935875 [silence]
sw2497B-ms98-a-0074 399.935875 407.839125 no i mean look at all the all the food containers are labeled uh with both systems i mean that that's no problem
sw2497B-ms98-a-0075 407.839125 416.162875 [silence]
sw2497B-ms98-a-0076 416.162875 418.511125 yeah well

sw2497B-ms98-a-0078 422.037125 428.489250 yeah i i i just i just chock it up to this obstinate Americanism because
sw2497B-ms98-a-0079 428.489250 442.610375 they sit there and and they just don't want to learn a new system you know it's just like they they won't learn foreign languages they go some you know they expect everybody to speak English yeah

sw2497B-ms98-a-0086 460.545375 474.198125 sure i mean you you look around at all these other countries i mean i mean you look at Japan not only do they learn the metric system they also learn the our system you know and and they also take three languages
sw2497B-ms98-a-0087 474.198125 483.524250 i mean yeah i mean it's no wonder that we're getting beat out on everything in the world because those people those other people out there are working
sw2497B-ms98-a-0088 483.524250 492.423750 yeah i mean look who's taking the the engineering jobs and the and the math jobs and the science jobs you know they're all Orientals
sw2497B-ms98-a-0089 492.423750 501.298125 i mean we've got loads of uh Asians here in school just like we do at every other school around this country there [vocalized-noise]

sw2497B-ms98-a-0095 533.948875 548.409875 uh i i don't hold out much hope for anything coming out of this Master's i i'm taking it more or less just because i'm interested in it but i'm i'm also taking a uh paralegal course and i i really want to
sw2497B-ms98-a-0096 548.409875 552.747875 do that more than anything else i i went to law school for a year and a half
sw2497B-ms98-a-0097 552.747875 562.574000 and uh decided well i don't really want to be a lawyer i mean i knew that going in i just wanted a law degree because it would open all kinds of doors but
sw2497B-ms98-a-0098 562.574000 573.228625 it's just too much work for a uh a degree you're going to hang on the wall and never use so i said well maybe i ought to save some money [laughter-here]
sw2497B-ms98-a-0099 573.228625 584.926125 so i got out of that and got back into the Master's and then decided well paralegal is really the nuts and bolts of the law and that's what i really like yeah
