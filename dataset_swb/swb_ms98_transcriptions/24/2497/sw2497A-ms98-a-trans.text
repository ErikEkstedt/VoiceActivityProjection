sw2497A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 4.494500 i think my daughter talked to somebody in Carolina what is that is it a school up there that uh
sw2497A-ms98-a-0002 4.494500 7.849750 oh great great that's wonderful yeah
sw2497A-ms98-a-0003 7.849750 13.430000 [silence]
sw2497A-ms98-a-0004 13.430000 22.737375 is that right yeah w[e]- we uh we thought the opposite we thought well it's going to be TI people and i think they went to customers you know people that use TI computers and everything which is fine
sw2497A-ms98-a-0005 22.737375 26.298250 [silence]
sw2497A-ms98-a-0006 26.298250 27.376875 uh-huh
sw2497A-ms98-a-0007 27.376875 28.631125 [silence]
sw2497A-ms98-a-0008 28.631125 43.411000 actually they don't talk about much uh of what it's for but my wife keeps keeps ask asking me and i'm saying well your computer is eventually going to just answer your voice you know they're they're of course it's uh very obvious for people with handicaps but in general i guess it would be faster
sw2497A-ms98-a-0009 43.411000 45.348375 than typing and everything so
sw2497A-ms98-a-0010 45.348375 48.526875 oh yeah it's it's uh around the corner
sw2497A-ms98-a-0011 48.526875 51.733500 [silence]
sw2497A-ms98-a-0012 51.733500 65.996500 right well i mean it's so uh TI's uh been the pioneer on a little advertising for TI not that i know that much about the uh voice synthesis but they've been working on it for years and years you know they have the Speak and Spell and all of that of course but they're
sw2497A-ms98-a-0013 65.996500 71.912875 they're going to take it much further and i guess in aircraft and all that a lot of it is going to be like you talk to the computer like
sw2497A-ms98-a-0014 71.912875 76.178000 two thousand one or two thousand t[en]- ten when you talk to the computer and ye[ah]-
sw2497A-ms98-a-0015 76.178000 77.785000 Hal right
sw2497A-ms98-a-0016 77.785000 82.523250 that was great well what do you think about the metric system you well what do you do uh out there are you a professor you say
sw2497A-ms98-a-0017 82.523250 83.716125 okay
sw2497A-ms98-a-0018 83.716125 100.373125 [silence]
sw2497A-ms98-a-0019 100.373125 110.447375 yeah well we're not going to have much to fight over because i do too uh being an engineer most General Motors have pretty much and i'm not too sure about the rest of the cars i'm sure all the Japanese cars
sw2497A-ms98-a-0020 110.447375 115.032000 i'm somewhat of a car buff [vocalized-noise] almost all of it is metric
sw2497A-ms98-a-0021 115.032000 122.692750 [silence]
sw2497A-ms98-a-0022 122.692750 123.813625 uh-huh

sw2497A-ms98-a-0024 128.271500 130.111000 right
sw2497A-ms98-a-0025 130.111000 138.129875 right well i i work on GM cars only and i haven't noticed that that much usually the metrics will fit they're so close there's an overlap
sw2497A-ms98-a-0026 138.129875 147.004875 uh you know there's something funny that i haven't really resolved with metric i've got to really go to the store and see if it's true i can't remember the size i think it's
sw2497A-ms98-a-0027 147.004875 158.916750 uh eighteen or something like that i have a set of metric and and the old wrenches too and i think that's an exact size of the three-quarters and they don't make it in metric they just skip over it and it
sw2497A-ms98-a-0028 158.916750 168.140750 right and i was thinking i've got to get an eighteen because i don't i don't like i'm so used to when i'm grabbing tools for my car to grab for the number you know
sw2497A-ms98-a-0029 168.140750 173.812375 because i don't even bother with the unless i'm working on a bumper or something but the engine parts and all are all metric you know
sw2497A-ms98-a-0030 173.812375 180.280000 [silence]
sw2497A-ms98-a-0031 180.280000 182.900375 i haven't noticed it mostly being
sw2497A-ms98-a-0032 182.900375 195.136375 yeah i mean well on General Motors cars it was all metric i use my metrics essentially when i work on the cars i don't well i guess uh in changing the oil i guess that's uh i don't even know a nine sixteenths some like that don't remember
sw2497A-ms98-a-0033 195.136375 196.912500 uh
sw2497A-ms98-a-0034 196.912500 201.666625 but i was thinking i just had a cheap set of metrics in fact uh
sw2497A-ms98-a-0035 201.666625 214.833250 i thought well i guess either i lost the eighteen and then i i started to see it in stores and i noticed that the the cheaper sets again i'm calling it cheaper sets minus the eighteen i thought well i've got to go to an expensive place so they go to Sears and get Craftsman tools there
sw2497A-ms98-a-0036 214.833250 217.563500 and see if i can't get that eighteen i want a full set you know
sw2497A-ms98-a-0037 217.563500 221.595375 i still haven't checked out to see if they do make the eighteen i'm i'm sure they do
sw2497A-ms98-a-0038 221.595375 224.417750 well i guess they do i don't know why they wouldn't you know
sw2497A-ms98-a-0039 224.417750 226.240500 oh you haven't really
sw2497A-ms98-a-0040 226.240500 230.035875 i just thought it was my set so i just didn't have a a good quality set you know
sw2497A-ms98-a-0041 230.035875 233.687875 [silence]
sw2497A-ms98-a-0042 233.687875 235.535000 uh
sw2497A-ms98-a-0043 235.535000 242.296125 i think it's what number did i just say eighteen something that is the same as a three-quarter and it that i i'd rather have it all metric
sw2497A-ms98-a-0044 242.296125 246.885750 [silence]
sw2497A-ms98-a-0045 246.885750 248.366250 right

sw2497A-ms98-a-0047 250.756000 260.969625 [vocalized-noise] uh Texas Instruments makes equipment for the semiconductor business you know we make not a lot of but we make we were making a lot of our own manufacturing equipment
sw2497A-ms98-a-0048 260.969625 274.892875 and i bet they have a lot of metrics there i think that uh the only emotional part might be in miles you know mile signs but that that's that could be last anyway maybe pick a year two thousand say okay we'll slowly change but i think
sw2497A-ms98-a-0049 274.892875 281.605875 [silence]

sw2497A-ms98-a-0054 290.770500 297.791875 well i think the speedometers [vocalized-noise] don't the cars have them both now am i not mistaken i i i look at mine i don't even know i read it
sw2497A-ms98-a-0055 297.791875 299.987875 upper and lower yeah

sw2497A-ms98-a-0061 317.251000 329.006625 i don't even know how many businesses are actually doing it without an order i'm not too sure that the government needs to order it although i guess they would have to in again mileage signs but uh it

sw2497A-ms98-a-0068 352.851750 367.316375 oh yeah i think that i i guess it was uh five years ago or more than when they it failed and i guess people just got tired of talking about it i'm not too sure i guess there was no one really pushing it and no one saying that it was going to mean business to us i think nowadays
sw2497A-ms98-a-0069 367.316375 371.976375 we all would say who are in industry and everything we'd say hey this means business we ought to
sw2497A-ms98-a-0070 371.976375 376.558625 uh make everything metric and i just and i see no problem with it at all
sw2497A-ms98-a-0071 376.558625 377.878250 uh

sw2497A-ms98-a-0076 393.647625 402.253000 well i i i'm ready to convert i i we probably all thought it was strange you know again five years ago but i don't think there's that many people with reservations anymore i don't know if uh

sw2497A-ms98-a-0080 408.446250 417.882375 in fact they said it failed and then i guess it has failed but i in uh in general there was still a lot of people that i i i'm not sure it's a total failure because so much has converted you know
sw2497A-ms98-a-0081 417.882375 423.622250 and i'm not too sure that it's actually not a success more than a failure you know i don't know what percent has actually converted

sw2497A-ms98-a-0117 595.506875 598.834000 if you're good at whatever you are you know and there's employment
