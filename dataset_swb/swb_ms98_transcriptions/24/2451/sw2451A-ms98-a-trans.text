sw2451A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.366375 [noise]
sw2451A-ms98-a-0002 1.366375 11.703250 okay this topic is is Russia a threat to our security i think they're more of a threat to their own people
sw2451A-ms98-a-0003 11.703250 16.716875 at this day and time how do you feel about it
sw2451A-ms98-a-0004 16.716875 44.665125 [silence]
sw2451A-ms98-a-0005 44.665125 56.404500 i believe Communism is very much waning it's uh pretty much on the way out of the door in so far as the strong hold that they used to have
sw2451A-ms98-a-0006 56.404500 69.000875 and the Russian people are all realizing that the Communist system does not work to their satisfaction or their way of surviving in this world
sw2451A-ms98-a-0007 69.000875 73.033000 and their rebellions right now
sw2451A-ms98-a-0008 73.033000 88.002375 is the result of that i[f]- if they can get the army or the military to sway to their side i think that uh it will be on the way out eventually
sw2451A-ms98-a-0009 88.002375 94.813000 it's just a matter of time because in the Baltic States they've already massacred
sw2451A-ms98-a-0010 94.813000 103.294875 so many people who protested and that hasn't set too well with their diplomacy
sw2451A-ms98-a-0011 103.294875 105.780625 for the
sw2451A-ms98-a-0012 105.780625 110.656625 regarding the uh outcome of their
sw2451A-ms98-a-0013 110.656625 112.527375 affairs
sw2451A-ms98-a-0014 112.527375 114.984625 [silence]
sw2451A-ms98-a-0015 114.984625 117.272875 what's your synopsis
sw2451A-ms98-a-0016 117.272875 184.827500 [silence]
sw2451A-ms98-a-0017 184.827500 188.685125 uh-huh i think that it went up a thousand percent on most
sw2451A-ms98-a-0018 188.685125 200.601250 [silence]
sw2451A-ms98-a-0019 200.601250 203.159125 um-hum
sw2451A-ms98-a-0020 203.159125 208.448750 but Gorbachev has still not fully convinced everyone that
sw2451A-ms98-a-0021 208.448750 213.562250 he's moving towards a two to three party system
sw2451A-ms98-a-0022 213.562250 223.880500 of government that nor eliminating or diminishing the Communist power [noise] and i guess that's where Yeltsin steps in
sw2451A-ms98-a-0023 223.880500 232.810625 so far as his politics of government goes uh but i don't know how convinced the people are of him yet myself
sw2451A-ms98-a-0024 232.810625 235.834125 [silence]
sw2451A-ms98-a-0025 235.834125 237.418750 uh-huh
sw2451A-ms98-a-0026 237.418750 242.927000 [silence]
sw2451A-ms98-a-0027 242.927000 244.021375 [vocalized-noise]
sw2451A-ms98-a-0028 244.021375 260.465000 [silence]
sw2451A-ms98-a-0029 260.465000 262.193125 um-hum
sw2451A-ms98-a-0030 262.193125 272.456750 [silence]
sw2451A-ms98-a-0031 272.456750 275.431250 yeah uh i understand it
sw2451A-ms98-a-0032 275.431250 297.636500 [silence]
sw2451A-ms98-a-0033 297.636500 299.027750 uh-huh
sw2451A-ms98-a-0034 299.027750 317.096875 [silence]
sw2451A-ms98-a-0035 317.096875 329.914000 i agree what's bad for the Soviet system is that they have the resources to grow and produce their food but somehow it just does not get out
sw2451A-ms98-a-0036 329.914000 333.027250 to the market the way it should
sw2451A-ms98-a-0037 333.027250 348.204375 [silence]
sw2451A-ms98-a-0038 348.204375 352.827500 yeah that's probably more true
sw2451A-ms98-a-0039 352.827500 355.300625 than a lot of people realize
sw2451A-ms98-a-0040 355.300625 363.819625 [silence]
sw2451A-ms98-a-0041 363.819625 365.658000 uh-huh
sw2451A-ms98-a-0042 365.658000 372.925875 [silence]
sw2451A-ms98-a-0043 372.925875 376.049250 it seems to be headed in that direction too
sw2451A-ms98-a-0044 376.049250 384.361750 [silence]
sw2451A-ms98-a-0045 384.361750 385.921125 uh-huh
sw2451A-ms98-a-0046 385.921125 391.902125 [silence]
sw2451A-ms98-a-0047 391.902125 397.581500 well their knowledge with uh better communication processes
sw2451A-ms98-a-0048 397.581500 406.509750 in this world now that's reached them is more [vocalized-noise] educated than to the uh ways of the western world
sw2451A-ms98-a-0049 406.509750 418.736375 and um i think that was a big stepping stone for them to initiate all their righteous ways
sw2451A-ms98-a-0050 418.736375 422.629625 of changing things
sw2451A-ms98-a-0051 422.629625 424.795625 to
sw2451A-ms98-a-0052 424.795625 432.903500 [silence]
sw2451A-ms98-a-0053 432.903500 440.369750 they probably not enough but i'm sure i lot of it's filtered down enough to the common folks
sw2451A-ms98-a-0054 440.369750 444.068375 that they have gotten wind
sw2451A-ms98-a-0055 444.068375 446.827000 of what they're missing out on
sw2451A-ms98-a-0056 446.827000 469.773000 [silence]
sw2451A-ms98-a-0057 469.773000 477.890625 [noise] yeah i'm sure a lot of them are missing those household items [laughter]
sw2451A-ms98-a-0058 477.890625 479.687375 [silence]
sw2451A-ms98-a-0059 479.687375 482.647125 yeah what we consider just
sw2451A-ms98-a-0060 482.647125 484.240875 [silence]
sw2451A-ms98-a-0061 484.240875 486.176625 i don't [laughter-know]
sw2451A-ms98-a-0062 486.176625 490.575125 normal everyday things to them is real luxury
sw2451A-ms98-a-0063 490.575125 494.312875 which is unfortunate for them
sw2451A-ms98-a-0064 494.312875 500.055625 and of course most of us we don't really appreciate what we've got
sw2451A-ms98-a-0065 500.055625 502.694875 because we've been so used to it
sw2451A-ms98-a-0066 502.694875 524.679375 [silence]
sw2451A-ms98-a-0067 524.679375 526.634000 [noise] yeah i agree
sw2451A-ms98-a-0068 526.634000 533.437750 [silence]
sw2451A-ms98-a-0069 533.437750 535.225750 yeah
sw2451A-ms98-a-0070 535.225750 536.917000 [silence]
sw2451A-ms98-a-0071 536.917000 548.340500 yeah i can go with that answer too the only yes i could go to is if uh a renegade crew decides to launch an attack
sw2451A-ms98-a-0072 548.340500 561.416250 or an accidental launching of something to that effect to for to a nuclear exchange but i don't even see that occurring uh because their
sw2451A-ms98-a-0073 561.416250 568.024375 internal strifes are more important right now than
sw2451A-ms98-a-0074 568.024375 574.715500 concentrating on any kind of outside affairs that they used to be
sw2451A-ms98-a-0075 574.715500 577.458875 [adamnet/adapted] to i guess
sw2451A-ms98-a-0076 577.458875 591.499750 [silence]
sw2451A-ms98-a-0077 591.499750 593.001250 uh-huh
