sw2451B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 16.551625 [silence]
sw2451B-ms98-a-0002 16.551625 23.745125 well they do have uh a major internal problem [laughter] everybody wants to defect and i can understand why um
sw2451B-ms98-a-0003 23.745125 34.763875 i think their biggest problem is just you know obtaining food to live so when you have the basic needs uh being unmet i don't think you think globally as far as you know
sw2451B-ms98-a-0004 34.763875 45.024250 being a threat to other people in the world so as soon as they get their their own home country taken care of then they'll consider [noise] what they can do with the rest of the world
sw2451B-ms98-a-0005 45.024250 116.045500 [silence]
sw2451B-ms98-a-0006 116.045500 125.707625 well i do i do realize that um uh the Bush Administration isn't too happy with with how they're handling their internal
sw2451B-ms98-a-0007 125.707625 140.031750 um strife you know as far as diplomacy is concerned i think it's been a good a good uh positive direction for um the Soviets as far as Yeltsin is concerned you know he was um 
sw2451B-ms98-a-0008 140.031750 151.589875 allowed to what wh[at]- in his in the in the Congress they they gave him more power as far as his republic in Russia is concerned which is gives him more power overall which i think is a good sign
sw2451B-ms98-a-0009 151.589875 165.062500 that there'll be some you know politically speaking you know he's going to have more power and i think it's a step in the right direction i think Gorbachev realizes that he's got a a major uh
sw2451B-ms98-a-0010 165.062500 176.821000 uh power figure you know competing against him and i think it's gonna be pretty close to his demise if he doesn't follow suit with Yeltsin as far as uh realizing
sw2451B-ms98-a-0011 176.821000 186.581375 well he does realize it you know with the fact that they reduced the uh or they increased the prices on their food food and goods uh
sw2451B-ms98-a-0012 186.581375 188.467000 [silence]
sw2451B-ms98-a-0013 188.467000 201.193625 it yeah tha[t's]- that's incredible but they had to um go in the direction of a market driven economy and and they had to bite the bullet for that so that's a good move on on Gorbachev's part in doing that
sw2451B-ms98-a-0014 201.193625 202.404250 [silence]
sw2451B-ms98-a-0015 202.404250 203.485375 so
sw2451B-ms98-a-0016 203.485375 231.813875 [silence]
sw2451B-ms98-a-0017 231.813875 242.989125 well that's all they got right now that's their ray of hope so you know they'll go with you know w[ho]- whoever comes through for them i it it's just that
sw2451B-ms98-a-0018 242.989125 253.385750 w[hat]- the weird thing is is that Gorbachev is the one that opened the floodgates as far as with glasnost and [poistroi[ka]-/perestroika] perestroika and stuff and i think he's caught between the Old Guard and and
sw2451B-ms98-a-0019 253.385750 267.746750 the new uh glasnost um i think it's kind of uh escalate to a point where it's out of control and i think he had to pull in the reins the only way he knew how in order to keep the peace on peace on both sides 
sw2451B-ms98-a-0020 267.746750 273.314125 so i think that's where you know kind of where he's stuck you know what i'm saying
sw2451B-ms98-a-0021 273.314125 285.959125 and that's the that's the situation that he finds himself in and you know he's a tough guy i mean he's been through it [laughter] so i have no doubt that he'll i mean y[ou]-
sw2451B-ms98-a-0022 285.959125 298.320000 i i think overall he's been a a good ah figure for the the Soviet Union i mean i think his intentions and his ideals are are uh well intentioned
sw2451B-ms98-a-0023 298.320000 303.232625 and in the long-term but i just think that because of
sw2451B-ms98-a-0024 303.232625 310.291125 the basic needs that the people don't have i think that that makes the problem most severe
sw2451B-ms98-a-0025 310.291125 315.866875 and makes him look [vocalized-noise] look worse that what his um what his ideals are
sw2451B-ms98-a-0026 315.866875 317.518125 personally
sw2451B-ms98-a-0027 317.518125 332.804375 [silence]
sw2451B-ms98-a-0028 332.804375 335.694250 i think it's i think it's a lot of uh
sw2451B-ms98-a-0029 335.694250 337.037375 [silence]
sw2451B-ms98-a-0030 337.037375 346.423125 oh how do you put it bureaucracy and and and uh one thing and then all the corruption i think there's a a a large amount of corruption
sw2451B-ms98-a-0031 346.423125 348.732875 on the the have and the have nots
sw2451B-ms98-a-0032 348.732875 352.803000 [silence]
sw2451B-ms98-a-0033 352.803000 354.848875 you know i
sw2451B-ms98-a-0034 354.848875 364.825875 i know you're going to have that with every society at least we're more blatant about it but it's very secret and it's been going on for years i mean you can't change things overnight
sw2451B-ms98-a-0035 364.825875 372.497750 and but if it gets to a point where people can't survive i mean there's revolution you know and that's
sw2451B-ms98-a-0036 372.497750 374.634250 [silence]
sw2451B-ms98-a-0037 374.634250 385.680250 [laughter-yeah] big time [laughter] major but you know that's that's what happens when you know the cork blows and you can't handle it anymore i mean that's
sw2451B-ms98-a-0038 385.680250 388.567125 that's the way the world uh
sw2451B-ms98-a-0039 388.567125 390.813375 you know revolves that way
sw2451B-ms98-a-0040 390.813375 425.641125 [silence]
sw2451B-ms98-a-0041 425.641125 430.753875 [noise] i really question though how much technology the average Soviet
sw2451B-ms98-a-0042 430.753875 432.968375 is exposed to
sw2451B-ms98-a-0043 432.968375 447.271625 [silence]
sw2451B-ms98-a-0044 447.271625 455.973875 yeah i think they're starting to realize but i i just don't think they have the resources if you were to compare uh
sw2451B-ms98-a-0045 455.973875 470.099375 the Americans to the Soviets as far as home computers are concerned or fact machines fax machines and cellular phones and state of the art equipment that we are so used to i don't think they even realize what's out there and to what extent
sw2451B-ms98-a-0046 470.099375 476.968250 [silence]
sw2451B-ms98-a-0047 476.968250 480.924750 yeah all the major conveniences of life [laughter]
sw2451B-ms98-a-0048 480.924750 490.221500 [silence]

sw2451B-ms98-a-0051 502.059125 510.869000 this is true this is very true and we it's human it's human nature though to take things for granted and it kind of
sw2451B-ms98-a-0052 510.869000 520.743000 you know when you've lost something or or uh uh don't have what other people have that's when you tend to realize you know
sw2451B-ms98-a-0053 520.743000 524.684625 what's out there and what you know what you have and what you don't have
sw2451B-ms98-a-0054 524.684625 526.905875 [silence]
sw2451B-ms98-a-0055 526.905875 533.478500 [noise] so the original question do we think they're a threat to our you know a s[ecurity]- s[ecurity]- security threat

sw2451B-ms98-a-0061 581.709125 586.594375 um we painted them back in the fifties and sixties as as
sw2451B-ms98-a-0062 586.594375 598.338250 {nonfeeling} machine type people and they're people just like us i mean you know they get up everyday and they put their pants on the same way and they have to eat and everything else and i just don't feel
