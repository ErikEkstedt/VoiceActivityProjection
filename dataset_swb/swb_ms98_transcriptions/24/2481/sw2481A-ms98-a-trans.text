sw2481A-ms98-a-0005 5.597625 12.893125 let me see uh interesting subject i was i was a law student for a year and a half so i've got uh slight bit of expertise in that area
sw2481A-ms98-a-0006 12.893125 14.590500 not much
sw2481A-ms98-a-0007 14.590500 15.629125 i
sw2481A-ms98-a-0008 15.629125 16.993000 okay

sw2481A-ms98-a-0012 22.582750 35.911500 uh okay it depends on the kind of action it is and also depends on the state um you don't have to have a jury of twelve and that's true in just about all states um
sw2481A-ms98-a-0013 35.911500 50.715750 it just depends on which ever state statue governs on the uh selection of juries now the the term petit usually a[pplies]- applies to grand juries you have a uh a grand jury and a petit grand jury
sw2481A-ms98-a-0014 50.715750 61.384500 um sometimes in some states they also call a uh less than twelve member jury a petit jury uh did that sufficiently confuse you

sw2481A-ms98-a-0016 65.446375 67.379250 um
sw2481A-ms98-a-0017 67.379250 70.619125 uh whe[n]- when do you have what a jury
sw2481A-ms98-a-0018 70.619125 76.210000 [silence]

sw2481A-ms98-a-0023 89.894000 93.389875 uh okay i- i st[ill]- i still don't get it both what

sw2481A-ms98-a-0027 99.289500 100.677000 oh okay yeah
sw2481A-ms98-a-0028 100.677000 113.749125 okay uh we[ll]- well what they do is on a criminal indictment first they go to the grand jury okay the grand jury will either indite or not once a person is indicted then they generally have an evidentiary hearing
sw2481A-ms98-a-0029 113.749125 115.539500 um
sw2481A-ms98-a-0030 115.539500 126.569250 and it's s[trange]- strange that there would have been a jury there because evidentiary hearings are u[sually]- are just before the judge now it's possible they had another trial
sw2481A-ms98-a-0031 126.569250 128.955250 in which
sw2481A-ms98-a-0032 128.955250 135.569250 now i- i- i don't know enough about it to to really to really say uh uh

sw2481A-ms98-a-0034 136.765125 139.371625 how long did the other trial go do you know

sw2481A-ms98-a-0036 143.930250 147.483875 y[eah]- yeah ye[ah]- uh the thing is
sw2481A-ms98-a-0037 147.483875 156.627500 in almo[st]- almost every case when there's a question about uh the evidence against the the person there's there's what's called an evidentiary hearing
sw2481A-ms98-a-0038 156.627500 162.776750 and the both sides get up there and the judge decides whether or not the evidence is good
sw2481A-ms98-a-0039 162.776750 170.638000 and if the evidence is good then they go ahead and go to trial so you were proba[bly]- probably being tapped for the jury for the trial

sw2481A-ms98-a-0067 249.176000 256.180750 well as long as they didn't question you too closely i mean the thing is uh the easiest way to get out of one of these things is uh
sw2481A-ms98-a-0068 256.180750 269.424375 uh uh they'll ask you questions like do you know the defendant have you heard anything about the case do you have any uh specially if it's a murder case they may be asking for uh for a capital uh
sw2481A-ms98-a-0069 269.424375 271.824500 a capital's capital punishment
sw2481A-ms98-a-0070 271.824500 276.560875 uh you can always say that you object to that and they'll let you off there

sw2481A-ms98-a-0072 285.936125 287.439500 yeah uh tha[t]-

sw2481A-ms98-a-0075 291.161375 294.482375 th[at]- you you have to be you have to be dead set against it
sw2481A-ms98-a-0076 294.482375 304.477750 the fact that you're willing the fact that you believe in it doesn't uh doesn't matter of course they're going to ask you ca[n]- do you think you could impose it in this case
sw2481A-ms98-a-0077 304.477750 311.249375 and you know i that that to me that's always been a stupid question i- i mean i don't know i haven't heard the evidence yet [laughter]

sw2481A-ms98-a-0102 415.716000 420.644625 nothing like taking your vaca[tion]- what you ought to do is reschedule your vacation real quick
sw2481A-ms98-a-0103 420.644625 423.435375 oh
sw2481A-ms98-a-0104 423.435375 426.670625 yeah um gosh
sw2481A-ms98-a-0105 426.670625 429.530375 what a way to spend your your vacation
sw2481A-ms98-a-0106 429.530375 436.072500 [silence]
sw2481A-ms98-a-0107 436.072500 438.323250 yeah that that's
sw2481A-ms98-a-0108 438.323250 444.704250 well it may because it it's something that could have influenced your your your uh
sw2481A-ms98-a-0109 444.704250 447.749500 uh your uh your bias
sw2481A-ms98-a-0110 447.749500 455.401750 so we[ll]- there's a good chance if they if they ask you about it you know i w[ould]- i wouldn't just come out and say i think the guys guilty
sw2481A-ms98-a-0111 455.401750 463.046000 but i- i would say that i've heard enough about this that i- i really have a preconceived notion
sw2481A-ms98-a-0112 463.046000 465.589875 of of what the guy did
sw2481A-ms98-a-0113 465.589875 467.664250 and i think that you know
sw2481A-ms98-a-0114 467.664250 471.748000 in in other words if you if you can just show that you're not going to be
sw2481A-ms98-a-0115 471.748000 476.351500 that you can't be uh unbiased that's going to be enough
sw2481A-ms98-a-0116 476.351500 481.559875 [silence]
sw2481A-ms98-a-0117 481.559875 493.230250 well there's been all kinds of talk about it but quite honestly i don't think there's anything else that we could put in place that would work as well i mean i- i realize it's cumbersome and uh
sw2481A-ms98-a-0118 493.230250 504.900625 uh it's time consuming and at times even ridiculous but it th[e]- tha[t]- nobody's come up with any better solution
sw2481A-ms98-a-0119 504.900625 513.651625 [silence]
sw2481A-ms98-a-0120 513.651625 516.741875 well that that is that's a
sw2481A-ms98-a-0121 516.741875 526.193750 that's one of those things i think's sor[t]- sort of a preconceived notion on the part of the public they you can have a whole bunch of money and you can have the best lawyers but
sw2481A-ms98-a-0122 526.193750 534.677500 y[ou]- you know if you've got if you've got a reasonable jury who will look at the evidence i mean you see that's what it all comes down to it's the jury
sw2481A-ms98-a-0123 534.677500 537.884250 uh if they are
sw2481A-ms98-a-0124 537.884250 539.315250 [silence]
sw2481A-ms98-a-0125 539.315250 547.759625 i mean there's no doubt that y[ou]- you can pick a jury okay in some in some respects you can get the kind of jury you want
sw2481A-ms98-a-0126 547.759625 559.296500 but short of that i mean if people are reasonable and they'll look at the evidence and decide on that basis then then you know supposedly money doesn't count
sw2481A-ms98-a-0127 559.296500 563.575000 but on the other hand what can you do about it i me[an]- what what solution is there
sw2481A-ms98-a-0128 563.575000 571.628875 [silence]
sw2481A-ms98-a-0129 571.628875 572.658250 uh

sw2481A-ms98-a-0131 575.690000 578.025250 oh you mean a court appointed lawyer
sw2481A-ms98-a-0132 578.025250 587.762250 yeah there's there's little doubt that i mean obviously a court appointed lawyer doesn't have the time or the resources to do as much
sw2481A-ms98-a-0133 587.762250 593.342125 but on the other hand i mean again what what can be done about it you know
sw2481A-ms98-a-0134 593.342125 599.971125 it's it's one of those i- i think unsolvable sort of things i mean we we make the motions of
