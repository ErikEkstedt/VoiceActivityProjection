sw2456A-ms98-a-0002 1.538000 6.811250 okay well our involve[ment]- in our involvement in the Middle East
sw2456A-ms98-a-0003 6.811250 8.604625 well
sw2456A-ms98-a-0004 8.604625 14.035250 i don't know how you feel about uh Iraq but i think we did the right thing there
sw2456A-ms98-a-0005 14.035250 17.189750 i think they stopped too soon though
sw2456A-ms98-a-0006 17.189750 18.948500 [silence]
sw2456A-ms98-a-0007 18.948500 22.675125 i think they should have just kept right on going into Baghdad
sw2456A-ms98-a-0008 22.675125 26.785875 uh probably could have struck a deal with the Saudi's and just let them_1 have Iraq
sw2456A-ms98-a-0009 26.785875 30.497000 [silence]
sw2456A-ms98-a-0010 30.497000 32.022750 um yeah
sw2456A-ms98-a-0011 32.022750 34.894000 [silence]
sw2456A-ms98-a-0012 34.894000 40.773125 well i don't either and it's certainly foreseeable the Kurds have always been
sw2456A-ms98-a-0013 40.773125 48.137625 that way and every time they try something they they get the pardon my French they get the crap kicked out of them_1
sw2456A-ms98-a-0014 48.137625 50.545625 and
sw2456A-ms98-a-0015 50.545625 56.570875 yeah yeah they're scattered all over really you got them_1 in Iran and Turkey and
sw2456A-ms98-a-0016 56.570875 63.653250 they sort of just meander around but they they hold true that Northern Iraq is theirs
sw2456A-ms98-a-0017 63.653250 75.434750 and uh i don't know it it was certainly foreseeable right after the war i mean it should have been obvious if it it was obvious to me it should have been obvious to the people in Washington there should have been some plans to
sw2456A-ms98-a-0018 75.434750 81.086000 try to give them_1 some aid i mean we helped the Afghanistanis there's know reason why we shouldn't have helped the Kurds
sw2456A-ms98-a-0019 81.086000 86.737250 didn't have to involve troops could have just given them_1 uh you know supplies
sw2456A-ms98-a-0020 86.737250 89.017000 [silence]
sw2456A-ms98-a-0021 89.017000 98.203250 no yeah i mean Lord there's things that we probably never will hear about that he's doing of course he's been doing it all along [laughter-anyway]
sw2456A-ms98-a-0022 98.203250 103.539625 [silence]
sw2456A-ms98-a-0023 103.539625 114.870500 yeah i can't say i mean it's it's easy to understand why he's still there i mean those people over there have nothing i mean you can't you can't drag this guy down with nothing
sw2456A-ms98-a-0024 114.870500 120.633125 and the only thing that surprised me i really i really expect the army guys to get him out
sw2456A-ms98-a-0025 120.633125 123.108250 i really expected to have a
sw2456A-ms98-a-0026 123.108250 127.134375 yeah i expected some of his generals and stuff to
sw2456A-ms98-a-0027 127.134375 129.308250 quietly do away with him
sw2456A-ms98-a-0028 129.308250 130.197500 [silence]
sw2456A-ms98-a-0029 130.197500 136.448625 but uh it's amazing that they could stand around and watch their forces get decimated that way and
sw2456A-ms98-a-0030 136.448625 137.668875 not
sw2456A-ms98-a-0031 137.668875 139.497125 do anything about it
sw2456A-ms98-a-0032 139.497125 143.069125 [silence]
sw2456A-ms98-a-0033 143.069125 147.886375 yeah it's either that or he's well entrenched and they couldn't get to him or something
sw2456A-ms98-a-0034 147.886375 149.513500 [silence]
sw2456A-ms98-a-0035 149.513500 151.080500 he's still running things
sw2456A-ms98-a-0036 151.080500 152.727375 [silence]
sw2456A-ms98-a-0037 152.727375 155.716625 and apparently still has a great deal of control
sw2456A-ms98-a-0038 155.716625 156.756375 [silence]
sw2456A-ms98-a-0039 156.756375 161.765250 i don't either it's it's tough to understand those Middle Eastern types anyway
sw2456A-ms98-a-0040 161.765250 166.360250 they they think completely differently the way we from the way we do
sw2456A-ms98-a-0041 166.360250 167.608625 [silence]
sw2456A-ms98-a-0042 167.608625 175.358125 i've got several Middle Middle Eastern friends uh my my father was stationed in Iran many years ago and i was a little boy there

sw2456A-ms98-a-0057 213.655000 226.038875 uh Tehran was a beautiful place i still remember the house we lived in great big old it was almost like something out of Ali Baba and the forty thieves you know
sw2456A-ms98-a-0058 226.038875 228.343625 yeah it was it was really nice
sw2456A-ms98-a-0059 228.343625 230.566750 we've got some nice uh
sw2456A-ms98-a-0060 230.566750 234.096875 uh Persian carpets that we still have

sw2456A-ms98-a-0063 238.436250 241.872625 well you ca[n]- you can but they're expensive
sw2456A-ms98-a-0064 241.872625 250.283625 i went matter of fact i went to a uh Persian carpet auction about three weeks ago and i'm just amazed at some of the prices they're getting
sw2456A-ms98-a-0065 250.283625 255.562500 [silence]
sw2456A-ms98-a-0066 255.562500 262.487750 no not out of there but of course these things are made in uh Pakistan and India and Afghanistan
sw2456A-ms98-a-0067 262.487750 271.381000 and all the Iranian ones are yo[u]- you know we we don't take them_1 anymore but there was loads and loads of them_1 sent over before the embargoes
sw2456A-ms98-a-0068 271.381000 273.851625 and so they're still floating ar[ound]-
sw2456A-ms98-a-0069 273.851625 276.156500 yeah there's a lot uh there's a lot of them_1
sw2456A-ms98-a-0070 276.156500 283.175625 the Afghanis[tan]- the uh Afghani uh carpets are are nice too i mean you can't tell the difference if you're not an expert
sw2456A-ms98-a-0071 283.175625 284.932375 they are all nice i mean
sw2456A-ms98-a-0072 284.932375 286.995750 they make nice carpet
sw2456A-ms98-a-0073 286.995750 289.029500 [silence]
sw2456A-ms98-a-0074 289.029500 290.717125 yeah they do
sw2456A-ms98-a-0075 290.717125 294.424625 the good ones are you can tell the machine made ones
sw2456A-ms98-a-0076 294.424625 299.375875 but the the handmade ones are very easy to spot because you have the same
sw2456A-ms98-a-0077 299.375875 304.718875 um you have a uh oh i forgot what they call it it's the the
sw2456A-ms98-a-0078 304.718875 318.830375 um [laughter] what am i trying to say not the picture it's the uh the way it's [woved/woven] you know [weived/woven] woven yeah woven how it's woven into the fabric and you know they have patterns pattern that's the word good grief it's been along day 
sw2456A-ms98-a-0079 318.830375 331.990250 [laughter] uh-huh um and when you turn it over you'll see that very same pattern uh it will be fainter of course but it will be that same way and the machine made ones they they do[n't]- they don't look like that
sw2456A-ms98-a-0080 331.990250 337.310000 it looks like our carpet where you just have a flat backing and then the thing is knitted into this backing
sw2456A-ms98-a-0081 337.310000 339.012500 [silence]
sw2456A-ms98-a-0082 339.012500 341.842625 they're nice though i- i like them i'm

sw2456A-ms98-a-0093 393.103500 406.026125 yeah i- i- i think it is too there's too many factions running around uh when i was in England uh a lot of uh a lot of Brit's work over in the Middle East um
sw2456A-ms98-a-0094 406.026125 414.505250 lots and lots of them_1 and it it it's a it's a real financial boom for them because the the the wages are tremendously high
sw2456A-ms98-a-0095 414.505250 421.331125 i mean they got all that money and they don't have anybody to pay it to um and it's tax free
sw2456A-ms98-a-0096 421.331125 433.763625 and they get free trips home twice a year things like that so they the Brit's loved it but i i'm not so sure i would want to go over there that's a little being an American you're still

sw2456A-ms98-a-0116 507.252250 513.436000 um the thing that surprises me really is that Israel's sitting there in the middle of all this
sw2456A-ms98-a-0117 513.436000 515.616625 uh i mean [laughter]
sw2456A-ms98-a-0118 515.616625 521.754250 i- i have some bones to pick with the Israeli's but you've got to admire their tenacity
sw2456A-ms98-a-0119 521.754250 528.539375 to be sitting there surrounded by hostile Arabs and to maintain this is our homeland you [laughter-know]
sw2456A-ms98-a-0120 528.539375 530.743375 they're pretty brave

sw2456A-ms98-a-0131 561.978500 572.087625 something the the Jews didn't really want to happen you know they're they're stuck with the fact that you've got to take in your fa[mily]- your brother Jew but
sw2456A-ms98-a-0132 572.087625 576.909500 they're also stuck with the fact they don't want to diversify their population that much
sw2456A-ms98-a-0133 576.909500 581.772750 the[y]- i mean they got a big problem with the Palestinians they don't need any other [laughter-problems]
