sw2436B-ms98-a-0026 90.981750 105.696875 it was just a just happened that we were exhausted and they wanted to watch and we said okay well we'll sit down and we'll you know look at what you want to see let's just turn it on and see what's on we could not find anything that had any kind of redeeming value in it
sw2436B-ms98-a-0027 105.696875 120.324625 and so we you know and it was prime time it was what seven thirty eight o'clock on a week night and n[o]- we have cable and there wasn't anything on any channel and and the stuff that was on the prime the networks you know ABC NBC CBS
sw2436B-ms98-a-0028 120.324625 125.116375 was it was just um dribble
sw2436B-ms98-a-0029 125.116375 137.800375 do you know i mean it wasn't even funny it wasn't creative it it was the worst i've seen i mean i have not watched prime time week night TV i guess in a real long time [laughter] because i was shocked i- i just

sw2436B-ms98-a-0055 198.214375 210.928375 it's just it's just an [noise] like a necessary evil i mean when we when our children were younger when they were like four years old three years old five years old we we just had Sesame Street and that was about it you know 
sw2436B-ms98-a-0056 210.928375 224.574750 but now in order to seem you know humane and normal we do allow them to watch cartoons and stuff but it's just one of those things you know you have to shut your eyes or not listen or something because those drive you crazy if you're
sw2436B-ms98-a-0057 224.574750 237.646250 if you're in the room so but it's such a shame because it could be so good i- i don't understand why first of all why the public puts up with it and second of all why the networks think that
sw2436B-ms98-a-0058 237.646250 247.209625 you know we [laughter-enjoy] that kind of stuff i ca[n't]- it's hard to believe that nobody can be any more creative than that that can't be the problem it must be the marketing pressures and
sw2436B-ms98-a-0059 247.209625 254.999750 you know their demographic studies that they do that show you know that everybody's IQ has dropped dramatically [laughter] or something
sw2436B-ms98-a-0060 254.999750 258.973250 [laughter]
sw2436B-ms98-a-0061 258.973250 263.963250 [silence]
sw2436B-ms98-a-0062 263.963250 268.488250 [laughter] i know why do you do this
sw2436B-ms98-a-0063 268.488250 279.032625 i know [vocalized-noise] i'm trying to think if there's anything i do you know i do like i like um stuff that's on Great Performances and i we used to watch mystery quite quite a bit and enjoyed that 
sw2436B-ms98-a-0064 279.032625 293.558875 stuff i guess that's mostly public on public TV stuff as a matter of fact you know when i was a kid [noise] excuse me my parents used to have we had this rule in our house for every hour of regular TV that we watched we had to watch an hour of public TV [laughter] 
sw2436B-ms98-a-0065 293.558875 307.294875 [laughter] that was just the rule and if they saw us watching something they'd say all right what did you see on What's New or there was some other the children's program i think at the time was called What's New so we had to give a little oral report before we could
sw2436B-ms98-a-0066 307.294875 314.508250 watch our program but do you watch do you watch sports on TV are you a sports fan

sw2436B-ms98-a-0087 374.649875 389.551000 you know trying to pass the time to wait till the next comedian comes up you know what i did [vocalized-noise] there was a time there where i could um tape things and then i'd fast forward through the [laughter] commercials saved a lot of time that way 
sw2436B-ms98-a-0088 389.551000 392.769875 [vocalized-noise] but that takes too much planning
