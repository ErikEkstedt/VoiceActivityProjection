sw2436A-ms98-a-0029 151.116875 160.759250 numb uh nothing surprised me any more seeing it on the TV you know and then all of a sudden i started paying paying attention to um
sw2436A-ms98-a-0030 160.759250 173.989125 to network TV again once in a while right now we don't have cable and it's surprising how much it's changed the you know the the the whole moral situation everything is just just gone one whole complete direction different 
sw2436A-ms98-a-0031 173.989125 181.146625 and uh w[e]- we don't have any kids yet but uh i i[t]- i- i feel the same way it's really tough to find something 
sw2436A-ms98-a-0032 181.146625 190.594750 that's that's uh that's going to be good and interesting for the kids even even cartoons um y[ou]- you know you [laughter] you watch uh you watch some of the cartoons and
sw2436A-ms98-a-0033 190.594750 198.449875 kids kids aren't even going to understand half the humor that's in there it none of it's probably damaging lot of times but uh
