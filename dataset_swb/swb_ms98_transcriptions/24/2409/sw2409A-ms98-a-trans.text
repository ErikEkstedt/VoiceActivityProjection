sw2409A-ms98-a-0043 130.963125 136.482125 of course charged those puppies up and it's oh boy when those bills start coming in
sw2409A-ms98-a-0044 136.482125 139.506375 they want a lot of money when you start getting them up there
sw2409A-ms98-a-0045 139.506375 142.359000 [silence]
sw2409A-ms98-a-0046 142.359000 144.162875 uh-huh uh-huh

sw2409A-ms98-a-0049 151.448500 152.368000 [silence]
sw2409A-ms98-a-0050 152.368000 153.608500 uh-huh

sw2409A-ms98-a-0054 158.377125 163.345125 i've noticed on the like the department stores they sure do hate it when you pay double payments
sw2409A-ms98-a-0055 163.345125 165.359250 you know it's like whoa [laughter]
sw2409A-ms98-a-0056 165.359250 166.864125 wait a minute
sw2409A-ms98-a-0057 166.864125 176.172500 don't pay us too much you know and they drop it your balance uh they drop your monthly payment down low because they want that interest to build up
sw2409A-ms98-a-0058 176.172500 181.027000 so that's what i normally try to do if it's pretty low i try to make a couple payments at a time
sw2409A-ms98-a-0059 181.027000 182.909250 and get it down quicker
sw2409A-ms98-a-0060 182.909250 184.998625 but they're easy to use
sw2409A-ms98-a-0061 184.998625 190.142875 [silence]

sw2409A-ms98-a-0088 257.725000 261.023250 [silence]
sw2409A-ms98-a-0089 261.023250 263.438000 ri[ght]- that's true that's true
sw2409A-ms98-a-0090 263.438000 265.005375 well we uh
sw2409A-ms98-a-0091 265.005375 269.498875 my husband always usually always pays with cash but i never seem to have cash
sw2409A-ms98-a-0092 269.498875 282.956625 or at least not enough you know to fill a tank up so i always almost always use my credit card on that on that and then it's nice you do tend to pay more for gas but other than that it's it's a good deal i think
sw2409A-ms98-a-0093 282.956625 289.565625 [silence]
sw2409A-ms98-a-0094 289.565625 291.311250 yeah i saw that

sw2409A-ms98-a-0097 298.795750 302.495750 but they won't they won't charge i saw that advertised too that's a good deal
sw2409A-ms98-a-0098 302.495750 307.078375 but it's real c[onvenient]- it's real convenient for me i re[ally]- i just like being able to go in and do that
sw2409A-ms98-a-0099 307.078375 310.564500 and and it's like American Express you have to pay it off at the end of the month so
sw2409A-ms98-a-0100 310.564500 311.643750 [silence]
sw2409A-ms98-a-0101 311.643750 313.506000 it's not going to go up too high
sw2409A-ms98-a-0102 313.506000 315.533125 so it's good for emergencies

sw2409A-ms98-a-0105 319.773000 328.094500 that's true we always use especially on trips you know we just charge all our gas that saves us spending it or shelling out the cash right then
