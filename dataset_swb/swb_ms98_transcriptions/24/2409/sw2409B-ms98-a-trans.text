sw2409B-ms98-a-0030 83.311375 92.288750 the uh yeah it's it's uh it is convenient to have that you know and it and if you can do a the a lot more with the American Express when we do when we go traveling
sw2409B-ms98-a-0031 92.288750 98.991875 uh the American Express works a lot better for some things because you can charge you know airline tickets
sw2409B-ms98-a-0032 98.991875 102.019875 and and get some benefits from that i think too
sw2409B-ms98-a-0033 102.019875 102.952625 you know
sw2409B-ms98-a-0034 102.952625 103.902250 [silence]
sw2409B-ms98-a-0035 103.902250 110.320500 but it's i tell you it's it's really uh it's tough to uh to deal with when you let your your balances build up
sw2409B-ms98-a-0036 110.320500 112.387875 you know so that it it's
sw2409B-ms98-a-0037 112.387875 118.081750 you've we did it uh intentionally i did it intentionally i was running some business expenses
sw2409B-ms98-a-0038 118.081750 120.154000 through the Visa card
sw2409B-ms98-a-0039 120.154000 124.375875 so i knew that i was running a balance up but it sure is hard to get it
sw2409B-ms98-a-0040 124.375875 126.232750 paid back down
sw2409B-ms98-a-0041 126.232750 127.577125 it uh

sw2409B-ms98-a-0046 138.595125 144.558125 but uh you know you find it's uh that the uh the interest rates vary so much on those that uh
sw2409B-ms98-a-0047 144.558125 153.114125 that we've been paying real close attention to that so we're using the ones that uh have the lower rate as a matter of fact the uh the uh credit union
sw2409B-ms98-a-0048 153.114125 158.896250 credit card i think has the lowest about the lowest interest rate of any of the ones that we use
sw2409B-ms98-a-0049 158.896250 161.568250 [silence]
sw2409B-ms98-a-0050 161.568250 162.882125 uh-huh

sw2409B-ms98-a-0060 184.375625 189.972000 so you haven't been tempted uh to to call any of these nine hundred numbers trying to get a credit card then
sw2409B-ms98-a-0061 189.972000 191.179875 [silence]
sw2409B-ms98-a-0062 191.179875 195.067375 i have been tempted i ju[st]- i saw one of those ads on TV last night that
sw2409B-ms98-a-0063 195.067375 196.451000 you know somebody
sw2409B-ms98-a-0064 196.451000 202.052625 call in right now you know and you can get your gold Visa card or gold MasterCard but uh
sw2409B-ms98-a-0065 202.052625 208.706000 and uh of course it's a nine hundred number which that means they're going to charge you you know fifteen or twenty dollars just to make the phone call
sw2409B-ms98-a-0066 208.706000 210.503875 [silence]
sw2409B-ms98-a-0067 210.503875 217.897750 well the thing is th[e]- that a lot of those are like they're set up through a bank or a savings and loan type thing
sw2409B-ms98-a-0068 217.897750 226.552375 and you have to have a deposit in that you know that deal of you know if you want a five hundred dollar credit line then you have to keep a five hundred dollar balance in there
sw2409B-ms98-a-0069 226.552375 229.600375 well then they sure they won't turn you down because they've got your money
