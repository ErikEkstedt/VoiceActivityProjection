sw2447B-ms98-a-0022 110.986125 123.184250 yeah i like them_1 [noise] too with with us we've got insurance of course but due to my husband's work but by the time like two weeks ago we all got sick all four us and one kid had to go to the doctor twice
sw2447B-ms98-a-0023 123.184250 137.314375 and then all the other th[e]- the rest of us did and he was like six hundred dollars [laughter-yeah] and it was we were we all had it was a viral pneumonia it was really bad and and we were just horribly sick but i mean six hundred dollars i can't come up with
sw2447B-ms98-a-0024 137.314375 149.075500 yeah all the doctors here will take a Visa so that and you know and go to KMart and use the pharmacy to pay for the uh medicines and then turn it all into the insurance company and wait for it to come back
sw2447B-ms98-a-0025 149.075500 158.473375 you know and so our part of it was still twenty percent but twenty percent i can payoff in one month [laughter-whereas] you know then i got to wait for the re[st]- the rest of it to come back from Aetna but it basically floats
sw2447B-ms98-a-0026 158.473375 168.182000 you know during the the time because_1 we've got a thirty day grace period on the credit card as long as you pay it you know within that time and that's usually enough time for the insurance to get back
sw2447B-ms98-a-0027 168.182000 182.175375 i try to make that our biggest use of credit cards i know people who are so in debt people who have five Visa cards i can't belie[ve]- you know it's like why did you go get they charged up one so then they but they were still paying their minimum so their credit rating was still good
sw2447B-ms98-a-0028 182.175375 188.605750 and and you would you know they get this in the mail say oh well we can't use that one anymore we'll just get another one and that's like who you

sw2447B-ms98-a-0048 291.710375 297.845250 but we've gone back the other way to some extent beca[use]- because just because there are times when you just can't pay it all
sw2447B-ms98-a-0049 297.845250 299.835625 because_1 there are just too many bills
