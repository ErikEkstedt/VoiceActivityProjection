sw2447A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.990625 [noise]
sw2447A-ms98-a-0002 1.990625 12.488375 probably uh the lifestyles and the size of the area we live in and an age can make a very difference in how credit cards are used um
sw2447A-ms98-a-0003 12.488375 20.493625 at this point in life i do not carry a credit card that i have to pay a service charge on
sw2447A-ms98-a-0004 20.493625 25.480875 right uh we used to have American Express and uh
sw2447A-ms98-a-0005 25.480875 29.779750 Visa that of course there's a yearly fee on
sw2447A-ms98-a-0006 29.779750 37.360375 and we got rid of those we now have Discover we have a Visa that does not have a yearly fee and then
sw2447A-ms98-a-0007 37.360375 49.971500 we have a card that our bank put out on a promotion this year that uh of the first year there is no yearly fee and of course we don't plan on keeping it the second year
sw2447A-ms98-a-0008 49.971500 54.244250 because_1 i'm pretty frugal about things like that
sw2447A-ms98-a-0009 54.244250 64.485625 [silence]
sw2447A-ms98-a-0010 64.485625 66.232500 uh-huh
sw2447A-ms98-a-0011 66.232500 77.195625 [noise]
sw2447A-ms98-a-0012 77.195625 91.999500 we find it especially useful because my husband retired over a year ago and we travel quite a bit and we we like to leave a credit card when we check into a motel in case we want to make a phone call or
sw2447A-ms98-a-0013 91.999500 106.373125 whatever which we do pretty often and and uh fact in a lot of motels we noticed from our most recent trip they that you do not even get the telephone turned on in your room unless you've left a credit card at the desk
sw2447A-ms98-a-0014 106.373125 111.652125 so i suppose for that reason we will always have a credit card of some kind but

sw2447A-ms98-a-0050 259.648375 263.457250 which meant i was taking about eight dollars a month off
sw2447A-ms98-a-0051 263.457250 275.993625 the balance b[y]- the time they got their interest out of it and it took forever to pay it off and at that point i promised myself i would never pay interest on a credit card again so that's kind of been my motto

sw2447A-ms98-a-0089 419.220500 425.496375 for one twelve dollar check it's never quite made sense to me but then uh
sw2447A-ms98-a-0090 425.496375 436.784875 when my husband was in business he had one customer who said that he had to use credit cards because he spent more than he made every month and he was perfectly serious about it
sw2447A-ms98-a-0091 436.784875 444.750000 so [noise] i don't know why he you know didn't go ahead and project to the fact that eventually that was going to catch up with him but 
sw2447A-ms98-a-0092 444.750000 446.485000 uh-huh
sw2447A-ms98-a-0093 446.485000 460.716250 i was very glad my husband retired and got away from that kind of thing [laughter] so we've we have a little problem with our gas card we're uh we've always used a Mobile card because he was affiliated with Mobile Oil and uh
sw2447A-ms98-a-0094 460.716250 471.474125 we it's very difficult to find their stations so i guess that's one reason why we use uh we've used Discover and Visa quite a bit for fuel even
sw2447A-ms98-a-0095 471.474125 488.667875 [silence]
sw2447A-ms98-a-0096 488.667875 490.490125 uh-huh

sw2447A-ms98-a-0098 492.801125 495.245500 i thought that was illegal
sw2447A-ms98-a-0099 495.245500 496.494750 [silence]
sw2447A-ms98-a-0100 496.494750 500.980625 no no no to uh put a surcharge on a credit card
sw2447A-ms98-a-0101 500.980625 502.207625 of
sw2447A-ms98-a-0102 502.207625 504.989375 [silence]
sw2447A-ms98-a-0103 504.989375 513.993750 oh so what they're doing they're discounting for cash is the way they're because i think it is illegal to add a surcharge so
sw2447A-ms98-a-0104 513.993750 520.723750 that's that they're looking at it differently it amounts to that you have to pay extra if you use your credit card but
sw2447A-ms98-a-0105 520.723750 531.967000 [silence]
sw2447A-ms98-a-0106 531.967000 533.280625 yeah
sw2447A-ms98-a-0107 533.280625 543.480500 um-hum so what we're saying is that we use a credit card when it uh is convenient but if it's going to cost us money we don't though [laughter] 
sw2447A-ms98-a-0108 543.480500 546.218625 [laughter-probably]
sw2447A-ms98-a-0109 546.218625 547.990375 [laughter]
sw2447A-ms98-a-0110 547.990375 552.284625 and leave us [laughter]
