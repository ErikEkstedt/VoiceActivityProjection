sw2404A-ms98-a-0052 237.269250 247.689625 they do or my cat does to me like she doesn't like anybody but me in fact no one would know i had her because if anyone comes over she immediately goes into [laughter-hiding]
sw2404A-ms98-a-0053 247.689625 249.789125 [laughter] but um
sw2404A-ms98-a-0054 249.789125 259.703875 i i had a dog for a while before i had my son and i grew up we grew up having dogs and i'd like to have a dog but
sw2404A-ms98-a-0055 259.703875 268.930250 kind of like for the same reasons as you i just the care that goes into them and you know if i you know decide to take off for a week or so
sw2404A-ms98-a-0056 268.930250 273.049375 you know i can't leave a dog like i can leave a cat
sw2404A-ms98-a-0057 273.049375 277.084625 and plus they require a lot in the way of training and
sw2404A-ms98-a-0058 277.084625 283.245000 which now that i'm home would probably be a good time to do it if i were going to do it but
sw2404A-ms98-a-0059 283.245000 290.484375 you know i just don't you know there i don't know why but with dogs it seems you have to have a lot more vet bills [noise]
sw2404A-ms98-a-0060 290.484375 292.832500 plus they're more expensive to get
sw2404A-ms98-a-0061 292.832500 296.701375 now my cat i've had her for eight or nine years
sw2404A-ms98-a-0062 296.701375 302.837875 i had her spayed and i had her declawed which you know was an initial expense but
sw2404A-ms98-a-0063 302.837875 310.233125 then she has not been sick one day i have never had her to the vet other than just her you know her maintenance stuff
sw2404A-ms98-a-0064 310.233125 318.707875 and it seems like whenever i've had a dog you know something always you know they're always getting sick or you know breaking a leg or [laughter] 
sw2404A-ms98-a-0065 318.707875 320.273500 something
sw2404A-ms98-a-0066 320.273500 325.603500 and i just i don't need that expense right now plus they eat more and
sw2404A-ms98-a-0067 325.603500 331.502500 [silence]
sw2404A-ms98-a-0068 331.502500 336.276875 yeah that yeah i don't know if that's such a big problem here in Dallas
sw2404A-ms98-a-0069 336.276875 347.094375 um my cat stays inside because she's declawed so i don't really have a problem with that but yeah if you had a dog you know they need exercise and you have to walk them

sw2404A-ms98-a-0077 374.113625 383.227750 [vocalized-noise] they make you feel special you know i live alone with my five year old and my cat and i mean she really does she makes me feel like she cares about me and 
sw2404A-ms98-a-0078 383.227750 390.493375 you know it it gives you some strokes there that you may not get otherwise because i'm cooped up in the house all day
sw2404A-ms98-a-0079 390.493375 392.678250 and um [noise]
sw2404A-ms98-a-0080 392.678250 398.392625 i would like to have what i would really like to have is an aquarium and have some really nice fish
sw2404A-ms98-a-0081 398.392625 407.880250 but until i get in a place where i feel like that's where i'm going to be for [laughter] a long time they're just their so hard to move

sw2404A-ms98-a-0084 412.674125 417.331750 yeah and now i have some friends who have aquariums and i enjoy 
sw2404A-ms98-a-0085 417.331750 429.023000 watching the fish and looking in at them you know but that's something that you really i feel that you need to learn about and read about you know you need to learn how to take care of them and you need to learn 
sw2404A-ms98-a-0086 429.023000 443.625625 what fish are compatible you know and what ones you can put together and what ones you can't you know how to feed them and how to you know to clean them you know the thought of cleaning an aquarium is not very [laughter] pleasing but
sw2404A-ms98-a-0087 443.625625 449.949750 with filters and all that stuff that they have now i mean they're almost maintenance free
