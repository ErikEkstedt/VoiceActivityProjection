sw2404B-ms98-a-0040 162.846375 166.950750 it's not something that um i had to like learn to
sw2404B-ms98-a-0041 166.950750 174.160000 something that's going to be running around your house that if you're unaccustomed to that you wouldn't like such a big change and

sw2404B-ms98-a-0053 208.229875 210.711000 let the kids have a pet because
sw2404B-ms98-a-0054 210.711000 217.594375 i wanted them to have practice in caring for someone else and you know not being so selfish

sw2404B-ms98-a-0059 229.987000 233.821875 everything i know that a lot of pets a lot of people have pets
sw2404B-ms98-a-0060 233.821875 236.465625 because they make good companions and

sw2404B-ms98-a-0081 325.103250 328.546000 expensive to maintain and
sw2404B-ms98-a-0082 328.546000 332.891750 keep the flea powder and the flea dip and [laughter]

sw2404B-ms98-a-0090 346.649750 351.562875 that's true they are a lot i guess that's the number one reason why i'm
sw2404B-ms98-a-0091 351.562875 361.259250 i'm not really ready to have a pet too much [laughter] i kind of consider these gerbils just kind of something you look at
sw2404B-ms98-a-0092 361.259250 362.392000 yeah they are not
sw2404B-ms98-a-0093 362.392000 374.150250 because they don't really acknowledge that they know you you know it's not like a pet pe[t]- a pet is someone that comes up to you and is happy to see you and that kind of thing
sw2404B-ms98-a-0094 374.150250 375.310500 but

sw2404B-ms98-a-0104 407.144250 412.991875 yes and they they take up a lot of you know good space like kind of like a bookcase 
sw2404B-ms98-a-0105 412.991875 424.369125 [silence]
sw2404B-ms98-a-0106 424.369125 426.617125 uh-huh huh

sw2404B-ms98-a-0110 450.146750 460.288875 yes and i noticed um that's kind of what i was attracted to these gerbils for is that they they have a certain area that they use like their bathroom
sw2404B-ms98-a-0111 460.288875 468.030750 and you can just um you know rinse that out it's kind off to the side it unscrews and
sw2404B-ms98-a-0112 468.030750 471.658625 and so you can just take it out with a garden hose rinse it out
sw2404B-ms98-a-0113 471.658625 481.010750 and you don't [vocalized-noise] supposedly you don't have to change all of the the bedding and everything except every three weeks which is not very often

sw2404B-ms98-a-0122 503.483000 508.885000 well i'm hoping that it'll be a little bit of diversion for the kids and a little bit of a
sw2404B-ms98-a-0123 508.885000 510.026250 [silence]
sw2404B-ms98-a-0124 510.026250 513.454625 they do and they're anxious for us to be able to hold it but i
sw2404B-ms98-a-0125 513.454625 518.418125 these just aren't going to be as tame as the book i got a book first
sw2404B-ms98-a-0126 518.418125 523.362500 [noise] they just don't seem like um well i guess we've have them about a week now and they're just not kind of

sw2404B-ms98-a-0130 528.327125 534.053875 well we hope that we got two females so that they're supposed to get along better
sw2404B-ms98-a-0131 534.053875 536.657250 and um and they won't have any babies 
sw2404B-ms98-a-0132 536.657250 538.252875 [silence]
sw2404B-ms98-a-0133 538.252875 543.720125 i guess we won't know unless they never have any babies [laughter]
sw2404B-ms98-a-0134 543.720125 546.070125 [silence]
sw2404B-ms98-a-0135 546.070125 547.789000 [laughter]
sw2404B-ms98-a-0136 547.789000 554.911125 well but you know the people that sold them go well it's hard to tell but we think and we're going oh great

sw2404B-ms98-a-0138 556.828500 561.311250 so if they have babies then we'll have to get rid of one of them

sw2404B-ms98-a-0140 570.556375 579.586500 yeah that's what i hear so i'm hoping i think they they have a really quick reproduction cycle of only like thirty days or something 
sw2404B-ms98-a-0141 579.586500 584.104000 so within a month i guess or two we'll know
sw2404B-ms98-a-0142 584.104000 585.128625 [silence]
sw2404B-ms98-a-0143 585.128625 587.244875 well i guess i better run go
