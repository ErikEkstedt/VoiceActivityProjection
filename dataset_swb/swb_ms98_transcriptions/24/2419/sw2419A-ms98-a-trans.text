sw2419A-ms98-a-0002 0.697875 2.263750 hey Dick who's your favorite team
sw2419A-ms98-a-0003 2.263750 4.714875 [silence]
sw2419A-ms98-a-0004 4.714875 6.179250 oh how come
sw2419A-ms98-a-0005 6.179250 7.461875 [silence]
sw2419A-ms98-a-0006 7.461875 8.908625 oh yeah
sw2419A-ms98-a-0007 8.908625 13.125750 [silence]
sw2419A-ms98-a-0008 13.125750 14.386625 yeah
sw2419A-ms98-a-0009 14.386625 20.300625 [silence]
sw2419A-ms98-a-0010 20.300625 28.790250 yeah they really uh uh they found out that all the guys that were backing up uh McMahon when they got to be the first guys weren't all that good after all
sw2419A-ms98-a-0011 28.790250 35.324125 [silence]
sw2419A-ms98-a-0012 35.324125 36.594125 yeah
sw2419A-ms98-a-0013 36.594125 37.601125 [silence]
sw2419A-ms98-a-0014 37.601125 42.818375 yeah and or they found that Tomczak really wasn't a he was a good backup quarterback was what he was
sw2419A-ms98-a-0015 42.818375 46.511500 yeah yeah he wasn't the guy to take them take them to the championship
sw2419A-ms98-a-0016 46.511500 49.095625 [silence]
sw2419A-ms98-a-0017 49.095625 55.553625 yeah i don't i don't know what's out there for quarterbacks and they've got a what about a mid a mid first round choice i think
sw2419A-ms98-a-0018 55.553625 56.976375 yeah
sw2419A-ms98-a-0019 56.976375 58.685250 [silence]
sw2419A-ms98-a-0020 58.685250 59.524125 yeah
sw2419A-ms98-a-0021 59.524125 63.810875 [silence]
sw2419A-ms98-a-0022 63.810875 66.349125 yeah yeah yeah Steve Walsh
sw2419A-ms98-a-0023 66.349125 71.300250 yeah he had had had sort of mixed success with them uh when he was there but
sw2419A-ms98-a-0024 71.300250 78.458625 well i i think once he goes into training camp with them and gets a full year at uh to do it it it'll work out okay for him i
sw2419A-ms98-a-0025 78.458625 88.356875 uh you know i uh he didn't have a chance here in Dallas because my gosh Aikman was the number one choice number one draft choice uh and with a long term six year contract
sw2419A-ms98-a-0026 88.356875 90.671750 and they were paying him a lot of money so Walsh
sw2419A-ms98-a-0027 90.671750 94.661000 yeah Walsh didn't have that much uh well as you probably guessed i'm a Cowboy fan
sw2419A-ms98-a-0028 94.661000 96.327500 uh more or less [laughter]
sw2419A-ms98-a-0029 96.327500 99.622875 and well it's hard uh because
sw2419A-ms98-a-0030 99.622875 113.083250 yeah uh i was here in nineteen sixty well i got to go back that i moved down from Pittsburgh in in fifty nine and uh in fifty eight i really became a pro football fan went to all the Steelers home games
sw2419A-ms98-a-0031 113.083250 120.204125 and they finished second that year i guess and it was Bobby Lane's first it was the year that Bobby Lane got traded to them two games into the season
sw2419A-ms98-a-0032 120.204125 129.801375 uh so that's where i started cutting my teeth on the NFL and then i got to Dallas and we didn't have any NFL in fifty nine so i sat and watched uh watched it on television
sw2419A-ms98-a-0033 129.801375 137.907500 then at the end of the fifty nine season when they announced we're gonna get a team in sixty i went out and bought two season tickets and i was in the first twelve season ticket holders
sw2419A-ms98-a-0034 137.907500 139.534000 for the Cowboys
sw2419A-ms98-a-0035 139.534000 141.862125 uh yeah except i don't use them
sw2419A-ms98-a-0036 141.862125 147.485375 uh [laughter] then what happened so we go a little bit further than that uh
sw2419A-ms98-a-0037 147.485375 158.189375 and i uh uh i was single then later i got married and i had my two season tickets and they were in the Cotton Bowl in the first row in the upper deck on the fifty yard line
sw2419A-ms98-a-0038 158.189375 160.264375 uh which was really nice [laughter]
sw2419A-ms98-a-0039 160.264375 167.519125 and uh in the early days uh you know ten twelve fourteen thousand people i'm talking about sixty through about sixty four
sw2419A-ms98-a-0040 167.519125 174.758750 uh was what we got i also bought season tickets to the Dallas Texans football team which is now the Kansas City Chiefs
sw2419A-ms98-a-0041 174.758750 183.297125 and i and i may have been the only one that did both because the mentality in Dallas was that you couldn't like both you had to like one and hate the other
sw2419A-ms98-a-0042 183.297125 193.229250 and and it was interesting because the AFL uh when when the Chiefs when the Texans were playing they would give the scores of the Cowboy games and the NFL games
sw2419A-ms98-a-0043 193.229250 198.617000 but the NFL refused to admit they existed so when the Cowboys were playing you never got the scores of their games
sw2419A-ms98-a-0044 198.617000 202.864000 and it you know it was the Lamar Hunt crowd versus the Clint Murchison crowd
sw2419A-ms98-a-0045 202.864000 212.793375 and uh and the the popular joke around Dallas was that after the sixty two season uh in fact i went down to Houston in sixty two and watched them win the AFL championship
sw2419A-ms98-a-0046 212.793375 218.103250 uh after the sixty two season Murchison and Hunt got together and flipped a coin and the loser had to [laughter-stay]
sw2419A-ms98-a-0047 218.103250 227.579500 and uh then in uh uh sixty uh uh let's see sixty nine when they decided to build the new stadium in Irving
sw2419A-ms98-a-0048 227.579500 233.127250 uh they let the uh uh they let the fans build it i mean it wasn't built with any tax payer money
sw2419A-ms98-a-0049 233.127250 238.331750 uh they floated bonds that the that the season ticket holders had to buy to maintain their status as season ticket holders
sw2419A-ms98-a-0050 238.331750 245.172750 so what was neat is you got to choose the tickets based on your seniority as a season ticket holder
sw2419A-ms98-a-0051 245.172750 247.969250 and uh so i had a first choice
sw2419A-ms98-a-0052 247.969250 257.448375 and uh i got in the upper tier uh well actually there was two types of seats there were two hundred and fifty dollar bonds and thousand dollar bonds that you had to [laughter-buy]
sw2419A-ms98-a-0053 257.448375 264.404000 and so i got the first choice of the two hundred and fifty dollar bonds so i was in the upper deck in the twelfth row on the fifty yard line
sw2419A-ms98-a-0054 264.404000 268.038750 i wonder if that guy that's in the eleventh row see he bought thousand dollar [laughter-bonds]
sw2419A-ms98-a-0055 268.038750 272.550250 that guy so uh that happened then uh
sw2419A-ms98-a-0056 272.550250 278.719750 ultimately i had uh i got transferred overseas by T[I]- i'm with TI and i got transferred overseas
sw2419A-ms98-a-0057 278.719750 289.914375 uh through most of the eighties so i ea[ch]- each year i just sold my t[ickets]- i had some people take custody of my tickets for me i served uh three year[s]- four years in Malaysia and three in the Philippines
sw2419A-ms98-a-0058 289.914375 300.418875 and uh now i got back i got kids in college and gosh i can't afford that price so i still keep them in my name but the guy who takes them calls me every year and says can i have the tickets one more year i say yeah fine take them
sw2419A-ms98-a-0059 300.418875 302.991500 so i still hold them but i don't go
sw2419A-ms98-a-0060 302.991500 310.766250 but uh the the funny thing about the Cowboys is is that everybody is really enthused because we've got all these umpteen jillion draft choices
sw2419A-ms98-a-0061 310.766250 320.741250 and uh but when you look back on the team uh uh except for probably Emmett Smith nobody that's been drafted in the last twelve years is a starter
sw2419A-ms98-a-0062 320.741250 327.479125 [silence]
sw2419A-ms98-a-0063 327.479125 333.941500 well if you don't make smart selections it doesn't do any good or if you make smart selections and they and you can't sign them
sw2419A-ms98-a-0064 333.941500 336.141250 [silence]
sw2419A-ms98-a-0065 336.141250 342.695000 yeah well i heard Jerry Jones say something interesting and i and i it must border on legality or ethnicity
sw2419A-ms98-a-0066 342.695000 348.061625 on draft day he's got about thirty people that are going out to their potential players
sw2419A-ms98-a-0067 348.061625 356.277000 and when it comes their time to choose they get thirty minutes or so these people will negotiate with the players and get them to sign a contract and if they won't sign a contract they won't draft them
sw2419A-ms98-a-0068 356.277000 357.299125 [silence]
sw2419A-ms98-a-0069 357.299125 361.422250 and and they will take the time allotted to make their choices to do that
sw2419A-ms98-a-0070 361.422250 363.076000 [silence]
sw2419A-ms98-a-0071 363.076000 364.785750 and uh uh
sw2419A-ms98-a-0072 364.785750 375.871875 yeah because see last year their first two draft choices were uh Alex uh Emmett Smith and Alexander Wright and they didn't get either of them until half way through the season and they didn't get to go through training camp with them
sw2419A-ms98-a-0073 375.871875 377.490250 [silence]
sw2419A-ms98-a-0074 377.490250 382.086000 yeah Smith came on pretty good Wright is is still in the in the potential category
sw2419A-ms98-a-0075 382.086000 384.982375 everybody likes his speed but he can't catch the ball
sw2419A-ms98-a-0076 384.982375 387.251375 [silence]
sw2419A-ms98-a-0077 387.251375 392.147125 no no no but but you know that's where Bob Hayes was in his early days too
sw2419A-ms98-a-0078 392.147125 393.314000 so
sw2419A-ms98-a-0079 393.314000 397.003125 [silence]
sw2419A-ms98-a-0080 397.003125 398.160500 hum
sw2419A-ms98-a-0081 398.160500 404.153125 [silence]
sw2419A-ms98-a-0082 404.153125 405.808000 oh yeah
sw2419A-ms98-a-0083 405.808000 410.286500 yeah well those were the glory years the seventies were absolutely
sw2419A-ms98-a-0084 410.286500 415.795625 [silence]
sw2419A-ms98-a-0085 415.795625 416.998750 yeah
sw2419A-ms98-a-0086 416.998750 418.001625 [silence]
sw2419A-ms98-a-0087 418.001625 428.925500 [laughter-yeah] and and and and and the seventies were really a it it saw the team's emergence as a super power coincided with the movement to Texas Stadium
sw2419A-ms98-a-0088 428.925500 437.711375 uh and the movement to Texas Stadium came along about the fifth game of uh of the seventy one season and that was the year they went to the Super Bowl and beat Miami
sw2419A-ms98-a-0089 437.711375 448.155875 in the Super Bowl the previous year that they'd finished in the Cotton Bowl they did go to the Super Bowl and got beat by Baltimore in in the in the last second or two but uh i mean in the seventies it was play-offs every year
sw2419A-ms98-a-0090 448.155875 459.321750 [silence]
sw2419A-ms98-a-0091 459.321750 462.148875 oh yeah there's so many people do that
sw2419A-ms98-a-0092 462.148875 466.741625 [silence]
sw2419A-ms98-a-0093 466.741625 467.913625 yeah
sw2419A-ms98-a-0094 467.913625 468.916625 [silence]
sw2419A-ms98-a-0095 468.916625 470.088625 yeah
sw2419A-ms98-a-0096 470.088625 473.088250 [silence]
sw2419A-ms98-a-0097 473.088250 474.331875 yeah
sw2419A-ms98-a-0098 474.331875 486.559000 [silence]
sw2419A-ms98-a-0099 486.559000 497.435750 [laughter] well i own four tick[ets]- i might i told you i had two i actually own four and in seventy one the year they moved into the stadium i bought two more because i had uh two children and they were very little
sw2419A-ms98-a-0100 497.435750 508.109500 and we just ended up taking the neighbors kids who were teenagers because our i thought that ultimately my own would want to go and the way the stadium was selling out in season tickets it might be totally sold out which it never did
sw2419A-ms98-a-0101 508.109500 517.035125 but uh uh at twenty nine dollars a pop now let's see six four's is uh-huh [vocalized-noise] that's a hundred and sixteen dollars
sw2419A-ms98-a-0102 517.035125 527.667375 and another five for parking so that's a hundred and twenty one dollars and with two kids in college and the potential of having three there next September uh i you know i'm going to watch them on television for a few years
sw2419A-ms98-a-0103 527.667375 530.753500 [silence]
sw2419A-ms98-a-0104 530.753500 533.810875 uh boy they don't have one uh
sw2419A-ms98-a-0105 533.810875 538.753500 yeah they they sure they sure found out in a hurry that Babe Wassenberg wasn't it didn't they
sw2419A-ms98-a-0106 538.753500 541.545000 [silence]
sw2419A-ms98-a-0107 541.545000 556.091000 yeah but you know it's it's interesting because old uh uh you know everybody said when they signed Steve Wal boy they're going to have to trade him they're going to have to trade him but you cannot seriously contend uh in the league without two front line quarterbacks
sw2419A-ms98-a-0108 556.091000 557.130875 [silence]
sw2419A-ms98-a-0109 557.130875 560.825250 and and and you know the years that we were good we had Staubach and Morton
sw2419A-ms98-a-0110 560.825250 574.290375 now the one that wasn't playing the one that wasn't playing was pissed off most of the time but nevertheless in in over three or four seasons both those guys went down with with severe injuries and the other guy stepped in and they didn't never lost a lick
sw2419A-ms98-a-0111 574.290375 576.530125 [silence]
sw2419A-ms98-a-0112 576.530125 577.738125 yeah
sw2419A-ms98-a-0113 577.738125 580.042125 [silence]
sw2419A-ms98-a-0114 580.042125 581.259500 yeah
sw2419A-ms98-a-0115 581.259500 585.934750 [silence]
sw2419A-ms98-a-0116 585.934750 587.041875 huh
sw2419A-ms98-a-0117 587.041875 591.772750 [silence]
sw2419A-ms98-a-0118 591.772750 600.129250 yeah yeah and uh that last championship they won in the Super Bowl Craig Martin was the only guy in the entire squad that did not get in the game but he got his winner's share
