sw2419B-ms98-a-0092 467.240125 469.578375 Cowboys there they had like four tickets
sw2419B-ms98-a-0093 469.578375 473.312375 they they they had four tickets because their kids were there of course their kids came and went
sw2419B-ms98-a-0094 473.312375 484.335125 but uh every time the kids didn't go we'd go and we'd go out there and just you know at at like ten o'clock in the morning and set up and there would be all these people gathered around that you know all the tailgaters and stuff
sw2419B-ms98-a-0095 484.335125 487.937250 and then everybody would wander into the stadium you know
