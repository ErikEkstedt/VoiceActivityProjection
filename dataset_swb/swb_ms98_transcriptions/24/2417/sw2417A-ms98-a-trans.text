sw2417A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.616625 [noise]
sw2417A-ms98-a-0002 0.616625 9.095875 well i don't know but uh i'm twenty two years old and i think it would be uh it's not a good choice to do that i mean you have uh
sw2417A-ms98-a-0003 9.095875 16.645250 everything here you know like uh the Army and everything else is a[ll]- all voluntary and that's the way you're going to dedicate yourself
sw2417A-ms98-a-0004 16.645250 28.526250 to to that you know to your job if it's voluntary i mean if you don't like it i mean if you're like in other places where they have a you know like mandatory you know uh services yeah 
sw2417A-ms98-a-0005 28.526250 42.287750 [silence]
sw2417A-ms98-a-0006 42.287750 51.638625 because i mean the thing is is that whenever you i mean you seen like for example you know like the war that just went on you saw you saw that
sw2417A-ms98-a-0007 51.638625 62.408125 some people were not going you know people that that had all the benefits that were sitting around for years you know maybe three four years getting paid uh by the government or you know
sw2417A-ms98-a-0008 62.408125 71.452000 they just when the when the time came they said no way you know when they when that was their job they joined it because they wanted to or well you know some people didn't
sw2417A-ms98-a-0009 71.452000 81.428875 didn't have the you know the money they said it's a good way of uh i[n]- coming in but those are public service i mean you i mean you would be getting paid very little you know or anything at all
sw2417A-ms98-a-0010 81.428875 86.644750 and uh you would just hate it so much that whatever you had to do
sw2417A-ms98-a-0011 86.644750 89.845500 would be just you know it's like you know
sw2417A-ms98-a-0012 89.845500 99.571750 yeah i mean you wouldn't you wouldn't do it i mean [vocalized-noise] the the the thing would be that it would throw you you know totally the wrong way you would be there because you had to be there
sw2417A-ms98-a-0013 99.571750 105.769250 but yet you would still respond to everything in a very you know negative way you know it's like do this why you know
sw2417A-ms98-a-0014 105.769250 114.447000 i i have a i d[on't]- i don't have to do anything you know it's like what am i going to do if i sit here if i sit here for a whole year they'll let me go and then i can get back to my life
sw2417A-ms98-a-0015 114.447000 124.979375 [silence]
sw2417A-ms98-a-0016 124.979375 126.418125 yeah
sw2417A-ms98-a-0017 126.418125 136.717375 [silence]
sw2417A-ms98-a-0018 136.717375 149.111625 well there i don't think there's any way it can you know like they say this proposal would any[where]- would get anywhere because of the i mean first of all i've never heard of it until this this phone call you know
sw2417A-ms98-a-0019 149.111625 155.353375 and uh if it is actually proposed and taken you know to the government or something
sw2417A-ms98-a-0020 155.353375 157.232250 yeah
sw2417A-ms98-a-0021 157.232250 163.907375 to to actually support it you know it would be just like saying that you know what a[re]- what are you crazy i mean there
sw2417A-ms98-a-0022 163.907375 172.206375 i mean y[ou]- i mean you know we had enough with the abortion issue that's still going around that you guys want to bring you know the next [laughter] you know
sw2417A-ms98-a-0023 172.206375 173.979000 [laughter-yeah]
sw2417A-ms98-a-0024 173.979000 197.453000 [silence]
sw2417A-ms98-a-0025 197.453000 201.389375 but see but you're going there and you know what you're getting into
sw2417A-ms98-a-0026 201.389375 203.568375 [silence]
sw2417A-ms98-a-0027 203.568375 204.922875 yeah
sw2417A-ms98-a-0028 204.922875 217.330375 [silence]
sw2417A-ms98-a-0029 217.330375 223.678000 yeah but it's it's not like saying like i'm born and then when i reached a certain age i'm going to have to do something you know
sw2417A-ms98-a-0030 223.678000 234.090250 it's uh it's not by choice it's like every[thing]- everything else you know it's like if i want to do it i'll do it but you know it's like you know and uh you know i have a background i'm from Argentina
sw2417A-ms98-a-0031 234.090250 240.544625 and uh everybody everybody that is unlucky enough has to do the military service
sw2417A-ms98-a-0032 240.544625 253.275125 and but you go into this whole big lottery every year and you know each uh your last three digits of your document you know like your social security number you're matched up with other numbers right
sw2417A-ms98-a-0033 253.275125 257.276625 from uh from uh one to a thousand
sw2417A-ms98-a-0034 257.276625 261.861500 and so if your number is below four hundred you're not going to have to do it
sw2417A-ms98-a-0035 261.861500 270.541125 say it's between four hundred and six hundred you might have to do it depending how many people are in your class and you know like you the they right
sw2417A-ms98-a-0036 270.541125 276.423000 and if it's above six hundred you're going to have to do it and i got one thirty one
sw2417A-ms98-a-0037 276.423000 289.332125 and so yeah i i didn't have to do it but the thing was that you have you know the whole the whole nation's watching you know like i[f]- if it's your class everybody that's your same age is l[istening]- listening to the radio
sw2417A-ms98-a-0038 289.332125 291.957125 waiting for them to announce the number you know
sw2417A-ms98-a-0039 291.957125 305.035375 and it's like and then you know you have people you know going you know it's like everywhere you know you have some people that are glad some people that are saying shit and the other people that are going oh my God i'm somewhere in the middle you know it's like [laughter-wow] am i going to have to do it
sw2417A-ms98-a-0040 305.035375 310.973750 yeah and you know but it's [vocalized-noise] my brother goes everybody in my family had to do it and they go
sw2417A-ms98-a-0041 310.973750 319.414000 you know it's just a year and a half of your life that's that's totally wasted you don't do anything else there's no time and you don't do anything
sw2417A-ms98-a-0042 319.414000 325.464750 you know you go there you train you get treated like shit and then you you i mean then you get out
sw2417A-ms98-a-0043 325.464750 328.673500 [silence]
sw2417A-ms98-a-0044 328.673500 330.244125 right
sw2417A-ms98-a-0045 330.244125 333.363875 and so i mean but you know it's like
sw2417A-ms98-a-0046 333.363875 344.786875 the thing is is that you know you just get treated i mean o[ne]- one of the guys that was doing it was uh like uh a waiter at one of the restaurants that kn[ow]- you know like the military had
sw2417A-ms98-a-0047 344.786875 350.803125 and that was his job you know he got he got you know like three months of uh you know physical training
sw2417A-ms98-a-0048 350.803125 353.497750 and then he got to serve all these people [laughter]
sw2417A-ms98-a-0049 353.497750 367.392250 you know but that's what they do i mean that's a year and a half of your life that's that you don't do anything that you have to be there you know maybe five times you know five times a week and that you know that you have a i guess a round robin schedule or something
sw2417A-ms98-a-0050 367.392250 368.986625 and uh
sw2417A-ms98-a-0051 368.986625 370.729125 [silence]
sw2417A-ms98-a-0052 370.729125 379.795000 no oh there i don't i don't think i don't think there is any pay wait i'm not sure because what happens is you get to like to ride buses for free
sw2417A-ms98-a-0053 379.795000 385.856375 well you do i guess you do get paid but the thing is is that you know people are what if they see you in the uniform
sw2417A-ms98-a-0054 385.856375 396.714625 right like for example y[ou]- you know like when they go around the train asking for tickets like short distant trains they won't ask you if you if you're wearing your military uniform for a ticket they'll just skip you
sw2417A-ms98-a-0055 396.714625 406.698750 and uh you know it's like they they consider that but it would be the same way here you know it's like i[f]- if you had to do it you know you have a big sign i'm sorry i don't get paid you [laughter-know]
sw2417A-ms98-a-0056 406.698750 416.049625 it's like please let me ride for free you know it's like i'm i'm living off dad for these wonderful two years which i have to do you know it's like
sw2417A-ms98-a-0057 416.049625 422.902625 and then the other thing is when i get out of college at twenty eight with my [laughter-BS] you know it's like by the time
sw2417A-ms98-a-0058 422.902625 424.894125 yeah
sw2417A-ms98-a-0059 424.894125 426.267500 [silence]
sw2417A-ms98-a-0060 426.267500 431.541125 and so that would be that would be see there're too many things that go against it that would be ridiculous
sw2417A-ms98-a-0061 431.541125 436.207625 so oh well it's been seven minutes
sw2417A-ms98-a-0062 436.207625 445.917000 i don't i d[on't]- well i don't i don't think they'll ever pass this i i i'm just going to laugh if i ever see it in the newspapers i i mean i don't read the newspaper that much but i never heard anything about it so
sw2417A-ms98-a-0063 445.917000 447.698125 [laughter] so
sw2417A-ms98-a-0064 447.698125 449.860250 [silence]
sw2417A-ms98-a-0065 449.860250 459.402125 and but then you won't have to do it just imagine sometimes your kids you'll be saying well it's your job go do it you know [laughter] but i[t]- [laughter] 
sw2417A-ms98-a-0066 459.402125 469.002500 yeah really then you'll have to say see in my age i didn't have to do it [laughter] oh really dad yeah [laughter] oh well okay
