sw2454A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.716500 [noise]
sw2454A-ms98-a-0002 0.716500 4.248750 i'm not sure i even know where to begin on this mess
sw2454A-ms98-a-0003 4.248750 5.774625 [silence]
sw2454A-ms98-a-0004 5.774625 19.990000 i do believe though a lot of specula[tive]- speculative buying and investment on speculation uh too many large deals with too much risk uh
sw2454A-ms98-a-0005 19.990000 28.666750 and and associates of friends and on it goes over a long period of time and i think
sw2454A-ms98-a-0006 28.666750 39.465125 it i think it's a a type of situation where okay the first investment didn't work but if we throw a little bit more money in on it maybe this one may you know and try to get our money back
sw2454A-ms98-a-0007 39.465125 40.817625 [silence]
sw2454A-ms98-a-0008 40.817625 42.693625 e[xactly]- exactly
sw2454A-ms98-a-0009 42.693625 44.272000 [silence]
sw2454A-ms98-a-0010 44.272000 53.479250 that's that is that is some of what some of what i had read is that's part of cause of it now as to the question of what to do about it
sw2454A-ms98-a-0011 53.479250 54.483125 [silence]
sw2454A-ms98-a-0012 54.483125 58.016625 uh it has to be government regulation
sw2454A-ms98-a-0013 58.016625 65.994125 [silence]
sw2454A-ms98-a-0014 65.994125 68.453125 i don't either
sw2454A-ms98-a-0015 68.453125 71.968000 [silence]
sw2454A-ms98-a-0016 71.968000 78.989250 but the other thing this Dickson that they convicted he only got five years
sw2454A-ms98-a-0017 78.989250 83.262375 so that's going to leave a message to other people that yeah
sw2454A-ms98-a-0018 83.262375 84.483625 [silence]
sw2454A-ms98-a-0019 84.483625 92.998000 well yes but he's in very poor health so you know twenty months may mean a lot longer for him but still
sw2454A-ms98-a-0020 92.998000 95.495125 [silence]
sw2454A-ms98-a-0021 95.495125 98.989500 it's our money it's our taxes that have to pay for this mess
sw2454A-ms98-a-0022 98.989500 106.974000 [silence]
sw2454A-ms98-a-0023 106.974000 110.493625 this is true this is very true
sw2454A-ms98-a-0024 110.493625 125.997500 [silence]
sw2454A-ms98-a-0025 125.997500 131.474750 and that's probably another cause of the problem we are looking at right now
sw2454A-ms98-a-0026 131.474750 136.801875 [silence]
sw2454A-ms98-a-0027 136.801875 140.740875 this is a very true thing i didn't think about that part of it
sw2454A-ms98-a-0028 140.740875 151.214875 [silence]
sw2454A-ms98-a-0029 151.214875 152.490875 uh-huh
sw2454A-ms98-a-0030 152.490875 154.249875 [silence]
sw2454A-ms98-a-0031 154.249875 157.012500 oh really that's interesting
sw2454A-ms98-a-0032 157.012500 160.765375 [silence]
sw2454A-ms98-a-0033 160.765375 163.998375 oh yes yes this is true
sw2454A-ms98-a-0034 163.998375 166.757375 [silence]
sw2454A-ms98-a-0035 166.757375 168.998750 oh how funny
sw2454A-ms98-a-0036 168.998750 173.350000 [silence]
sw2454A-ms98-a-0037 173.350000 175.335500 how much that cost us
sw2454A-ms98-a-0038 175.335500 182.498375 [silence]
sw2454A-ms98-a-0039 182.498375 186.025750 that is scary i didn't think about that
sw2454A-ms98-a-0040 186.025750 199.035750 [silence]
sw2454A-ms98-a-0041 199.035750 205.697125 they must be getting some on the national level i think i've read various things but i just no names come to mind
sw2454A-ms98-a-0042 205.697125 212.269125 [silence]
sw2454A-ms98-a-0043 212.269125 218.959625 yeah because that's a drop in the bucket to the taxes we're going to have to pay to to make up for this
sw2454A-ms98-a-0044 218.959625 232.457125 [silence]
sw2454A-ms98-a-0045 232.457125 235.970000 you know you've got a good point there
sw2454A-ms98-a-0046 235.970000 250.237000 [silence]
sw2454A-ms98-a-0047 250.237000 251.996750 and the
sw2454A-ms98-a-0048 251.996750 253.978375 [silence]
sw2454A-ms98-a-0049 253.978375 268.468750 and the other thing is they said the insur[ance]- the uh insurance agents the insurance industry is beginning to resemble the savings and loan industry so they they say the next big crisis could well be our insurance
sw2454A-ms98-a-0050 268.468750 271.312875 as another uh
sw2454A-ms98-a-0051 271.312875 273.784000 [silence]
sw2454A-ms98-a-0052 273.784000 280.743500 my car insurance is frightening right now i cannot believe how much money i pay
sw2454A-ms98-a-0053 280.743500 284.497125 [silence]
sw2454A-ms98-a-0054 284.497125 288.780750 well and i just carry the absolute minimum required by law
sw2454A-ms98-a-0055 288.780750 296.228250 and i'm paying i mean every quarter i'm paying like five hundred dollars a year and that
sw2454A-ms98-a-0056 296.228250 298.746625 [silence]
sw2454A-ms98-a-0057 298.746625 301.018375 oh my
sw2454A-ms98-a-0058 301.018375 317.216500 [silence]
sw2454A-ms98-a-0059 317.216500 322.615625 well i you know the problem is who is they and you get they is the government
sw2454A-ms98-a-0060 322.615625 323.772250 [silence]
sw2454A-ms98-a-0061 323.772250 331.011375 but you get you get into when you start getting them to do things you get into a lot of special interest groups again
sw2454A-ms98-a-0062 331.011375 333.169000 and you know
sw2454A-ms98-a-0063 333.169000 341.493250 and and would that make it worse or would that make it better or would that offer new opportunities for other people
sw2454A-ms98-a-0064 341.493250 351.967750 that's what scares me when you get into that type of situation you know if you are going to change it watch out for the person that's changing it they may put another loophole in that
sw2454A-ms98-a-0065 351.967750 354.763625 wasn't even there to begin with
sw2454A-ms98-a-0066 354.763625 361.962625 [silence]
sw2454A-ms98-a-0067 361.962625 374.481250 and i think reading the newspaper for that type of thing is a waste of time because they're there to sell newspapers that's the problem with the news both the on television and the paper
sw2454A-ms98-a-0068 374.481250 384.255875 well all they're there to sell you know or to entertain even worse and uh not to transmit information
sw2454A-ms98-a-0069 384.255875 390.313375 so what we get is so garbled that who knows if we even have the ability to decide anything
sw2454A-ms98-a-0070 390.313375 398.271625 [silence]
sw2454A-ms98-a-0071 398.271625 402.211250 and whose best interests they represent us or someone else
sw2454A-ms98-a-0072 402.211250 403.290625 [silence]
sw2454A-ms98-a-0073 403.290625 411.494625 in in a savings and loan [laughter] or own a or has a brother that owns yeah
sw2454A-ms98-a-0074 411.494625 412.983375 [silence]
sw2454A-ms98-a-0075 412.983375 416.204500 it's really a scary scary thing
sw2454A-ms98-a-0076 416.204500 435.698000 [silence]
sw2454A-ms98-a-0077 435.698000 443.637750 well now there was an article in the paper this morning in the business section how tough it was to get a loan approved anymore
sw2454A-ms98-a-0078 443.637750 453.951000 yeah whe[n]- when you know when you're trying to buy a house how incredibly hard it is to get get a loan approved simply because they're they are tightening down so much
sw2454A-ms98-a-0079 453.951000 479.997625 [silence]
sw2454A-ms98-a-0080 479.997625 483.428500 uh-huh oh yes
sw2454A-ms98-a-0081 483.428500 487.491250 [silence]
sw2454A-ms98-a-0082 487.491250 489.465750 smart move
sw2454A-ms98-a-0083 489.465750 495.488375 [silence]
sw2454A-ms98-a-0084 495.488375 497.481500 oh did they
sw2454A-ms98-a-0085 497.481500 498.492625 [silence]
sw2454A-ms98-a-0086 498.492625 500.489125 oh
sw2454A-ms98-a-0087 500.489125 502.642625 that's not
sw2454A-ms98-a-0088 502.642625 510.789375 [silence]
sw2454A-ms98-a-0089 510.789375 512.484625 well
sw2454A-ms98-a-0090 512.484625 513.716375 [silence]
sw2454A-ms98-a-0091 513.716375 516.733000 but they are hurting their own credit that way
sw2454A-ms98-a-0092 516.733000 534.680625 [silence]
sw2454A-ms98-a-0093 534.680625 536.985250 oh absolutely
sw2454A-ms98-a-0094 536.985250 538.991875 [silence]
sw2454A-ms98-a-0095 538.991875 545.479750 yeah because they can you know they write all that and people that write things off as bad debt
sw2454A-ms98-a-0096 545.479750 555.670375 that lowers their threshold of income of what they have to pay taxes on which automat[ically]- automatically makes our taxes go up because there is so much that has to be paid
sw2454A-ms98-a-0097 555.670375 564.206875 and if this guy is exempt from paying it we have to pay more that's exactly right so it's just
sw2454A-ms98-a-0098 564.206875 574.220625 [silence]
sw2454A-ms98-a-0099 574.220625 578.033125 yeah that is really sad
sw2454A-ms98-a-0100 578.033125 587.983125 [silence]
sw2454A-ms98-a-0101 587.983125 589.703500 yes
sw2454A-ms98-a-0102 589.703500 596.734500 [silence]
sw2454A-ms98-a-0103 596.734500 599.293750 and and the unoccupied
