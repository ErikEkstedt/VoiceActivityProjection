sw2477B-ms98-a-0012 38.260125 42.108625 had a really good team was the year that Danny Aines was there
sw2477B-ms98-a-0013 42.108625 45.271625 that's about five six years ago by now
sw2477B-ms98-a-0014 45.271625 48.064625 so they made it to the [noise]
sw2477B-ms98-a-0015 48.064625 53.009000 sweet sixteen once or twice in their history and that's
sw2477B-ms98-a-0016 53.009000 57.919000 and they usually lose in the first round what they get [vocalized-noise] [laughter]
sw2477B-ms98-a-0017 57.919000 59.454750 how about you

sw2477B-ms98-a-0034 130.636125 134.021500 yeah that i i watched that game
sw2477B-ms98-a-0035 134.021500 140.319000 and uh it was a good game it was a very close game and hard fought game
sw2477B-ms98-a-0036 140.319000 152.337000 and it just i don't know it looked like UNLV may have had more uh talent but as far as playing together as a team that day it didn't Duke seemed to have them off balance
sw2477B-ms98-a-0037 152.337000 153.762625 and that uh
sw2477B-ms98-a-0038 153.762625 158.145500 they didn't just couldn't a[ren't]- aren't they more of a running gun team [vocalized-noise]

sw2477B-ms98-a-0040 160.040375 163.758875 right fast breaks and things and
sw2477B-ms98-a-0041 163.758875 167.336750 they shut all that down and made them_1 pay half court it seemed and
sw2477B-ms98-a-0042 167.336750 168.885375 and
sw2477B-ms98-a-0043 168.885375 170.150875 what

sw2477B-ms98-a-0047 181.209375 187.582125 right right they didn't have they didn't have to go through some tough games during the year and that and that
sw2477B-ms98-a-0048 187.582125 193.780500 and so that's the you know it's a terrible time to have to deal with one right in it when when it counts so much
sw2477B-ms98-a-0049 193.780500 198.954375 [silence]

sw2477B-ms98-a-0052 201.330000 209.578125 i think i think that that probably was the difference in that game because_1 it really could have gone an[y]- either way down to the end you know
sw2477B-ms98-a-0053 209.578125 212.606375 [silence]
sw2477B-ms98-a-0054 212.606375 213.976875 well

sw2477B-ms98-a-0058 219.773000 222.033375 since Kareem's retired
sw2477B-ms98-a-0059 222.033375 224.002625 they haven't had a center
sw2477B-ms98-a-0060 224.002625 226.174250 and uh they've got Perkins
sw2477B-ms98-a-0061 226.174250 229.142625 but i don't think he's really been a super star for them
sw2477B-ms98-a-0062 229.142625 230.345125 and
sw2477B-ms98-a-0063 230.345125 231.926750 [silence]

sw2477B-ms98-a-0066 235.599875 237.020750 so
sw2477B-ms98-a-0067 237.020750 246.156000 i uh they'll make it you know i it's it's it's going to be a war between uh between Chicago and uh and uh and uh
sw2477B-ms98-a-0068 246.156000 248.125125 Boston Celtics
sw2477B-ms98-a-0069 248.125125 251.738250 that's going to be a war it's going to be a great series

sw2477B-ms98-a-0080 275.976375 277.540000 [silence]
sw2477B-ms98-a-0081 277.540000 278.895000 uh-huh
sw2477B-ms98-a-0082 278.895000 284.992000 yeah they have the they have the play-off experience well so doe[s]- so does Detroit i mean so does Chicago
sw2477B-ms98-a-0083 284.992000 290.737875 so do they all three of them do with Larry Bird back uh you can never count the Celtics out when Larry Bird's
sw2477B-ms98-a-0084 290.737875 296.579250 uh starting to click on all cylinders they say he's starting to do starting to play

sw2477B-ms98-a-0090 307.105125 310.677375 last i've heard is that he's starting to peak right now
sw2477B-ms98-a-0091 310.677375 315.008500 and he's starting to be more consistent you know right at the right time of the year
sw2477B-ms98-a-0092 315.008500 318.792125 oh a[ny]- any dark horses i you know
sw2477B-ms98-a-0093 318.792125 323.263125 San Antonio San Antonio the dark horse that could could
sw2477B-ms98-a-0094 323.263125 326.891625 really flip in there i think somewhere
sw2477B-ms98-a-0095 326.891625 328.357625 yeah
sw2477B-ms98-a-0096 328.357625 337.782000 he's got to be pretty much you know i use to say Akeem Olajuwon was the dominant player you know when [vocalized-noise] against any team he would dominate but
sw2477B-ms98-a-0097 337.782000 340.125000 Robinson's getting up there [laughter-where]
sw2477B-ms98-a-0098 340.125000 346.960250 every game he's just i mean it looks like he's going in for a dunk and they kind of just scoot out of his way or take a step back you know nobody's
sw2477B-ms98-a-0099 346.960250 352.113125 got enough beef i guess to challenge him when he's when he's driving hard to the hoop
sw2477B-ms98-a-0100 352.113125 354.228000 he's uh he
sw2477B-ms98-a-0101 354.228000 356.832375 too bad the Mavericks couldn't get him [laughter]
sw2477B-ms98-a-0102 356.832375 359.862375 [laughter] with Roy Tarpley they're in big trouble

sw2477B-ms98-a-0109 375.713625 378.639625 um if they did they'd still have to pay his [laughter-contract]
sw2477B-ms98-a-0110 378.639625 380.098000 they may have done it
sw2477B-ms98-a-0111 380.098000 385.639375 it was a lot of money he was making like i heard on the radio it was sixty three thousand and change a month
sw2477B-ms98-a-0112 385.639375 387.468375 that's what [laughter-he] [laughter-was] being paid

sw2477B-ms98-a-0114 389.380875 391.925250 oh boy what a good job he had
sw2477B-ms98-a-0115 391.925250 394.586000 he ru[ined]- ruined his sweet position
sw2477B-ms98-a-0116 394.586000 395.788125 [laughter]
sw2477B-ms98-a-0117 395.788125 399.521500 yeah i'm looking forward to the the pro play-off uh
sw2477B-ms98-a-0118 399.521500 402.424000 LA yeah San Antonio
sw2477B-ms98-a-0119 402.424000 413.811750 who's the other one that's doing so well this year Por[tland]- is that Portland Portland i haven't seen them on much TV at a[ll]- much at all but all i you do is hear about boy they have the scene the you know what do they have Walter Davis and

sw2477B-ms98-a-0126 428.427875 433.931625 yeah yeah i don't i don't think there's any clear pick that you know
sw2477B-ms98-a-0127 433.931625 441.631250 i guess i guess the two teams that i just you know think you can't count out are the are the Celtics and the w[ell]- because_1 of Bird and and
sw2477B-ms98-a-0128 441.631250 449.943625 Lakers because of Magic Johnson they they're two guys that seem to find a way when there's when there's when it's on the line they seem to find a way
sw2477B-ms98-a-0129 449.943625 453.246375 you know uh so
sw2477B-ms98-a-0130 453.246375 456.037625 those are what m[akes]- makes a champion i guess
