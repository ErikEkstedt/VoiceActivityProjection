sw2464B-ms98-a-0042 187.468125 200.617125 yeah it was a mandatory and then you had to take a test that showed you had a certain knowledge of state government and state service and they did offer actually certain types of public service internships that i think is a very good idea that that's mandatory

sw2464B-ms98-a-0081 384.139625 398.178375 yeah that's we're in a yeah that's we're in a near next to a town called Plano Texas and it's very um it's like Falls Church Alex[ander]- i mean Montgomery County i'm familiar with where you're at um and they really that's a good way to put it i know
sw2464B-ms98-a-0082 398.178375 405.302250 i went to high school in the city of Chicago at an inner city school although i lived in a different area near a place called Evanston Illinois
sw2464B-ms98-a-0083 405.302250 413.585625 and the reason that i stayed at the school i did was because at Evanston township which back then was like one of the three larger schools in the country
sw2464B-ms98-a-0084 413.585625 424.524500 everybody was already doing the um driving the beamers and you know with nothing to think that um they didn't have five hundred dollar wardrobes you know every week that kind of thing
sw2464B-ms98-a-0085 424.524500 431.548750 i i just i just think the one thing they do so strongly about is what your saying that i don't think kids have a sense of civic responsibility
sw2464B-ms98-a-0086 431.548750 436.829625 i think then that's a step away from even duty i don't think they even have a sense of the responsibility

sw2464B-ms98-a-0104 538.186750 543.263875 anything any else we can [laughter] we can talk about
