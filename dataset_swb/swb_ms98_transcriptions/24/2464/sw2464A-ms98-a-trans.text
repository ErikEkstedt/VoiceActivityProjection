sw2464A-ms98-a-0024 103.828750 108.387125 [silence]

sw2464A-ms98-a-0029 117.954125 119.482375 yes
sw2464A-ms98-a-0030 119.482375 120.875375 [silence]
sw2464A-ms98-a-0031 120.875375 133.246375 and and how do how do you think that they would propose to do is far as if uh a person is coming out of high school and going to college how could you know i wonder how they could possibly
sw2464A-ms98-a-0032 133.246375 137.051375 uh if this would be a voluntary thing or a mandatory
sw2464A-ms98-a-0033 137.051375 140.765125 [silence]
sw2464A-ms98-a-0034 140.765125 143.557750 yes it did yeah
sw2464A-ms98-a-0035 143.557750 146.614375 [silence]
sw2464A-ms98-a-0036 146.614375 158.151000 well i think i would also and i think it it really uh would be very difficult in terms of uh you know people i'm thinking mainly people going to college i don't see how
sw2464A-ms98-a-0037 158.151000 167.253875 how with uh the work load kids have nowadays and what often most college students i'm like maybe when we went to school i don't know how long ago you went but
sw2464A-ms98-a-0038 167.253875 178.312750 yeah [laughter] me too and and uh you know i think it it's it's most of them now carry part-time jobs on top of having fifteen or sixteen credits
sw2464A-ms98-a-0039 178.312750 187.058500 [silence]
sw2464A-ms98-a-0040 187.058500 188.839875 ye[ah]- oh really
sw2464A-ms98-a-0041 188.839875 193.602250 [silence]
sw2464A-ms98-a-0042 193.602250 194.831000 yeah
sw2464A-ms98-a-0043 194.831000 197.035625 [silence]
sw2464A-ms98-a-0044 197.035625 198.580875 i see
sw2464A-ms98-a-0045 198.580875 200.126625 [silence]
sw2464A-ms98-a-0046 200.126625 201.571500 yeah
sw2464A-ms98-a-0047 201.571500 203.945750 [silence]
sw2464A-ms98-a-0048 203.945750 210.077250 yeah the other thing i think that they could do possibly is with um
sw2464A-ms98-a-0049 210.077250 221.816375 i don't know when i went to school we had um in our social studies we had it divided into for every report card period like there were five or six six week sessions and we could pick what we wanted
sw2464A-ms98-a-0050 221.816375 238.546000 to take you know whether you wanted to study American Indians or this or that maybe as one of those six week sessions instead of having a class um or have the class but as part of that or part of the credit would be to do something like that on a voluntary basis
sw2464A-ms98-a-0051 238.546000 240.014125 [silence]
sw2464A-ms98-a-0052 240.014125 249.384875 yeah yeah i i uh i really i'm bewildered as far as how they could even work something like this in if they try to make it mandatory
sw2464A-ms98-a-0053 249.384875 257.090750 [silence]
sw2464A-ms98-a-0054 257.090750 258.444750 right
sw2464A-ms98-a-0055 258.444750 262.535750 [silence]
sw2464A-ms98-a-0056 262.535750 270.850125 right and in this area there's so much going on volunteer wise like for home life uh i you know i know it's for
sw2464A-ms98-a-0057 270.850125 283.784500 yeah yeah there there are many organizations uh feed the hungry all these there's a lot of drives in school for this type of thing already you know not necc[essarily]- sometimes um
sw2464A-ms98-a-0058 283.784500 296.709125 they might even have i know uh with a niece and nephew of mine they're school was uh like uh church school and they even had things where they would have them go to shelters downtown and help for a day
sw2464A-ms98-a-0059 296.709125 311.045125 or um what a lot of kids do here is um they have things to school where they have actual they have a holiday game night but every your uh your uh fee if you want to call it or the way you get admitted to going to this show is to
sw2464A-ms98-a-0060 311.045125 314.065250 bring a can or two for the hungry
sw2464A-ms98-a-0061 314.065250 319.618625 [silence]
sw2464A-ms98-a-0062 319.618625 320.878250 uh-huh
sw2464A-ms98-a-0063 320.878250 323.442500 [silence]
sw2464A-ms98-a-0064 323.442500 327.360625 oh yeah [laughter] that's quite different from up here i guess yes
sw2464A-ms98-a-0065 327.360625 328.994375 [silence]
sw2464A-ms98-a-0066 328.994375 330.491500 [laughter]
sw2464A-ms98-a-0067 330.491500 332.841875 [silence]
sw2464A-ms98-a-0068 332.841875 337.395125 yeah that is this yeah that is pretty wild that is pretty wild yeah
sw2464A-ms98-a-0069 337.395125 344.574500 [silence]
sw2464A-ms98-a-0070 344.574500 351.094250 right right or yeah i think they can integrate maybe a short period of time
sw2464A-ms98-a-0071 351.094250 360.730125 in with high school students and get them to be aware that you know they're not uh especially teenagers they're not the only ones around and what maybe their
sw2464A-ms98-a-0072 360.730125 372.239375 you know their parents are going through especia[lly]- i know in an area like this it's uh fairly affluent and and kids here are really out of touch with reality i always call it Disneyland here
sw2464A-ms98-a-0073 372.239375 379.955125 uh we're in no we're in uh where they call it now north Potomac it's it's a [vocalized-noise] town but it's close to Potomac
sw2464A-ms98-a-0074 379.955125 387.734875 and um you know you see sixteen year olds driving around in brand new BMWs and it's just unbelievable you know
sw2464A-ms98-a-0075 387.734875 392.483875 [silence]
sw2464A-ms98-a-0076 392.483875 394.481875 right
sw2464A-ms98-a-0077 394.481875 396.411250 yeah
sw2464A-ms98-a-0078 396.411250 400.943500 [silence]
sw2464A-ms98-a-0079 400.943500 402.421750 uh-huh
sw2464A-ms98-a-0080 402.421750 404.844125 [silence]
sw2464A-ms98-a-0081 404.844125 406.115875 uh-huh
sw2464A-ms98-a-0082 406.115875 412.941875 [silence]
sw2464A-ms98-a-0083 412.941875 414.498750 yes
sw2464A-ms98-a-0084 414.498750 422.013375 [silence]
sw2464A-ms98-a-0085 422.013375 423.543500 yeah
sw2464A-ms98-a-0086 423.543500 425.492000 yeah yeah
sw2464A-ms98-a-0087 425.492000 431.147500 [silence]
sw2464A-ms98-a-0088 431.147500 432.965625 no they don't
sw2464A-ms98-a-0089 432.965625 435.944875 [silence]
sw2464A-ms98-a-0090 435.944875 450.145875 right and i think one other area here is that um this is typically what we call in this area yuppie area and people aren't my kids you know other than you know occasionally they're not even aware that there are people over fifty that
sw2464A-ms98-a-0091 450.145875 462.452875 exist [laughter] [laughter-you] [laughter-know] and and i think it might be another good public service might be to have them help out in geriatric homes or you know this type of thing they are around uh
sw2464A-ms98-a-0092 462.452875 465.218875 [silence]
sw2464A-ms98-a-0093 465.218875 466.835000 uh-huh

sw2464A-ms98-a-0096 474.207000 475.842375 yeah
sw2464A-ms98-a-0097 475.842375 479.890625 [silence]
sw2464A-ms98-a-0098 479.890625 492.261250 right and i i in general i feel that um i don't know what this still proposes far as what age or or how they would do this but i feel that reaching
sw2464A-ms98-a-0099 492.261250 500.012375 the kids when they're younger is better though i think once they're out of high school they're so into their own thing that i think it would be very difficult maybe by that
sw2464A-ms98-a-0100 500.012375 511.044625 time they're too uh calloused to what is even going on you know where as younger children it's the it's the grade school children when there say no to drugs and that type of thing in school
sw2464A-ms98-a-0101 511.044625 515.916500 they're the ones that'll come home and tell you you know you shouldn't smoke it's bad for you shouldn't drink it's bad for you
sw2464A-ms98-a-0102 515.916500 527.065625 and i think it's the younger it's the younger uh kids that it reaches more and so if they want to start this type of thing it should be integrated maybe from a young age and and
sw2464A-ms98-a-0103 527.065625 528.819000 yes
sw2464A-ms98-a-0104 528.819000 534.629125 [silence]
sw2464A-ms98-a-0105 534.629125 536.709625 right right
sw2464A-ms98-a-0106 536.709625 539.691125 yeah i think so uh
sw2464A-ms98-a-0107 539.691125 545.357500 i don't [laughter-know] i guess that's [laughter-it] say hi to Pittsburgh if you're [laughter]
