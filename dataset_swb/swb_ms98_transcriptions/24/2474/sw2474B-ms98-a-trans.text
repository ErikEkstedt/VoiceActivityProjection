sw2474B-ms98-a-0002 2.075750 14.070000 [laughter] well let's see it's been cloudy today [laughter] and no not very much we had a little bit of sprinkle but for the most part it's um it's pretty
sw2474B-ms98-a-0003 14.070000 19.973875 dry out there we didn't have a whole lot we just had a little bit lot of dew this morning
sw2474B-ms98-a-0004 19.973875 21.474250 [silence]
sw2474B-ms98-a-0005 21.474250 23.180500 okay
sw2474B-ms98-a-0006 23.180500 28.746125 [silence]
sw2474B-ms98-a-0007 28.746125 40.902750 yeah yeah definitely is warmer i know there's a lot of difference between the Plano weather and the uh Dallas weather um-hum yeah there's there's like a five degree difference between
sw2474B-ms98-a-0008 40.902750 52.415500 like if you leave TI the Central Expressway site and you go north at about the Richardson Plano border there's a distinct change in the it's usually about five degrees cooler
sw2474B-ms98-a-0009 52.415500 53.532125 [silence]
sw2474B-ms98-a-0010 53.532125 60.616125 uh-huh about five degrees usually most of the time you can definitely tell a pronounced difference so
sw2474B-ms98-a-0011 60.616125 61.755125 [silence]
sw2474B-ms98-a-0012 61.755125 73.964750 no the only thing i figure is that maybe it's because there is more concrete that absorbs heat and things like that and down there there's a lot more um
sw2474B-ms98-a-0013 73.964750 77.701375 natural stuff like you know trees and parks and things like that up here
sw2474B-ms98-a-0014 77.701375 91.488500 and everything but there is a difference uh when i used to drive a convertible all the time i'd have the top down and maybe it was sixty in Dallas and then i'd drive up into Plano and be like go[sh]- i'm cold you [laughter-know] turn the heat on [laughter-or] [laughter-something] 
sw2474B-ms98-a-0015 91.488500 92.598125 [silence]

sw2474B-ms98-a-0020 109.210000 117.696500 right right probably more rain and everything because_1 i think you get you would get hit more by it was more like west right of Dallas
sw2474B-ms98-a-0021 117.696500 118.934125 [silence]
sw2474B-ms98-a-0022 118.934125 120.923375 just straight north

sw2474B-ms98-a-0024 124.746625 138.063875 oh okay north north okay yeah there i know most the stuff seems to kind of petered out before it really gets into Dallas and a lot of it just kind of phases away you know a lot of times you'll hear it's real bad over in uh Fort Worth too
sw2474B-ms98-a-0025 138.063875 139.467000 [silence]

sw2474B-ms98-a-0039 179.946000 185.167875 oh yeah well we planted something like thirty of them_1 [laughter] this year [laughter]
sw2474B-ms98-a-0040 185.167875 186.210000 [silence]
sw2474B-ms98-a-0041 186.210000 197.285500 no no well um they're all growing and i've got buds on quite a few of them so i'm hoping that in about another week or two i'll have lots of blooms and everything
sw2474B-ms98-a-0042 197.285500 198.163250 [silence]
sw2474B-ms98-a-0043 198.163250 205.906000 i'm gonna i'm gonna put some of them_1 in the house but i'm going to bring a lot of them_1 into work because_1 you you spend a lot of time at work and so that's the place really you kind of look at them_1 but
sw2474B-ms98-a-0044 205.906000 212.709625 oh yeah i love them_1 and then just i'm on a test a rose test panel this year for a national company
sw2474B-ms98-a-0045 212.709625 225.792875 and uh they send you roses that only have numbers no names they're brand new hybrids and they send them_1 to you and you you know it's like you know what do you think of the rose you know do you like the leaves do you like this and
sw2474B-ms98-a-0046 225.792875 226.981000 [silence]
sw2474B-ms98-a-0047 226.981000 241.067875 well i go through um i get a lot of s[tuff]- a lot of advertising and stuff from Jackson and Perkins Roses that's who does this and um i go ahead and and they send me some well this the first year they sent me the test panel thing
sw2474B-ms98-a-0048 241.067875 243.597875 because i always get a lot of roses from them_1
sw2474B-ms98-a-0049 243.597875 251.172375 and so they sent it to me and and i said oh yeah that'll be cool and one of them there's four that they send
sw2474B-ms98-a-0050 251.172375 259.801625 and i've got one that's going to be pink one that's going to be white no i take it back one is going to be yellow uh one that's going to be red and white
sw2474B-ms98-a-0051 259.801625 273.588875 and one that's going to be pink and white so i'm anxious to see what they look like because_1 that's all they tell you they just say well they're supposed to be these colors they don't tell you which ones supposed to be which so i've got these things planted out there that have numbers and i've
sw2474B-ms98-a-0052 273.588875 277.986000 got the little form i'm supposed to fill out and write all my opinions and stuff on and
sw2474B-ms98-a-0053 277.986000 286.271625 and so it's it's just this is before they even are named like you know you can suggest names for them_1 because of what you think and things like that
sw2474B-ms98-a-0054 286.271625 294.553375 and then they um you know then they let you know you write in and they let you know later on what the r[esults]- general results were throughout the United States
sw2474B-ms98-a-0055 294.553375 298.107000 [silence]
sw2474B-ms98-a-0056 298.107000 302.566625 no we have a tiny yard [laughter]
sw2474B-ms98-a-0057 302.566625 315.196125 oh it's going to be re[ally]- it's going to be really neat it really is and so i'm real excited about it because it's we have the bed for them we dug up the soil i mean we took the soil up and like two feet by two feet down
sw2474B-ms98-a-0058 315.196125 322.049125 and you know the bed's pretty big you know especially the long ones has that has all the regular roses in it it's real big
sw2474B-ms98-a-0059 322.049125 333.882000 it spans about forty feet on one side of of our fence but we have the perfect yard for it because the sun comes up in the morning and strikes the back yard all morning until you know about
sw2474B-ms98-a-0060 333.882000 336.668500 about two o'clock in the afternoon
sw2474B-ms98-a-0061 336.668500 338.320625 so we get
sw2474B-ms98-a-0062 338.320625 339.931250 um-hum
sw2474B-ms98-a-0063 339.931250 341.974125 oh really
sw2474B-ms98-a-0064 341.974125 344.297000 [silence]
sw2474B-ms98-a-0065 344.297000 345.842000 um-hum
sw2474B-ms98-a-0066 345.842000 348.544125 [silence]
sw2474B-ms98-a-0067 348.544125 351.196500 right bakes the front [laughter-yard]
sw2474B-ms98-a-0068 351.196500 352.425625 [silence]
sw2474B-ms98-a-0069 352.425625 360.427500 so is your is um so is your front like facing kind of north too like northwest sort of
sw2474B-ms98-a-0070 360.427500 373.002625 just due west because_1 see we get the afternoon sun but the front of our house also gets hit blasted by the north wind so the front o[f]- so the front of our house is kind of angled kind of strange i mean we're facing
sw2474B-ms98-a-0071 373.002625 383.530000 kind of like north northwest and so the back is is like southeast and so we get we get really horrendous weather in the front of our house
sw2474B-ms98-a-0072 383.530000 390.201625 you know because_1 we get we got to have something out there that can protect itself from the north because_1 the cold hits us
sw2474B-ms98-a-0073 390.201625 404.057375 and then it bakes [laughter-during] the summer and the backyard is great because we get all the southerly winds back there and so they're not blowing as hard and uh then we get the eastern sun so the backyard's great for growing stuff
sw2474B-ms98-a-0074 404.057375 411.139125 [silence]
sw2474B-ms98-a-0075 411.139125 412.469125 um-hum
sw2474B-ms98-a-0076 412.469125 415.622625 [silence]
sw2474B-ms98-a-0077 415.622625 417.249125 um-hum
sw2474B-ms98-a-0078 417.249125 421.426500 [silence]
sw2474B-ms98-a-0079 421.426500 422.849250 oh yeah
sw2474B-ms98-a-0080 422.849250 425.438500 [silence]
sw2474B-ms98-a-0081 425.438500 426.558375 yeah
sw2474B-ms98-a-0082 426.558375 429.020375 [silence]
sw2474B-ms98-a-0083 429.020375 430.881250 um-hum
sw2474B-ms98-a-0084 430.881250 431.994250 [silence]
sw2474B-ms98-a-0085 431.994250 444.684125 well they can take they can take a lot of heat and a lot of sun the red ones don't tend to do as well the blooms out like in extreme heat because_1 they tend to turn black around the edges and stuff
sw2474B-ms98-a-0086 444.684125 451.808375 so if if you're looking you know plant some of your uh your pinks and your yellows tend to do really good in extreme
sw2474B-ms98-a-0087 451.808375 461.018125 sunlight whereas your whites and your reds tend to do better like say with an eastern exposure so they don't bake as much
sw2474B-ms98-a-0088 461.018125 472.261625 so it was something i i've been doing a l[ot]- a lot of research and a lot of reading because_1 i i like to grow i like to grow the roses outside and then i grow African Violets inside so
sw2474B-ms98-a-0089 472.261625 473.623250 [silence]
sw2474B-ms98-a-0090 473.623250 475.395625 oh really
sw2474B-ms98-a-0091 475.395625 477.046000 um-hum
sw2474B-ms98-a-0092 477.046000 481.714500 [silence]
sw2474B-ms98-a-0093 481.714500 483.362000 hum
sw2474B-ms98-a-0094 483.362000 488.960000 [silence]
sw2474B-ms98-a-0095 488.960000 491.141875 um-hum
sw2474B-ms98-a-0096 491.141875 504.355375 well that's all i all i do is i water mine once a week and they're kind of like succulents so if you kind of forget to water them_1 a little bit sometime[s]- they'll be okay but the problem i think most people have with African Violets is that they water too much
sw2474B-ms98-a-0097 504.355375 514.963000 and uh they are susceptible to rotting and so when there's too much water they die and that's that's what really kills them is the too much water
sw2474B-ms98-a-0098 514.963000 528.874875 yeah [vocalized-noise] well when the leaves get sort of when they're not real stiff anymore then they really need water i mean they're like you know i've used up all my water give me some type of thing but um yeah that's something you know i have lots of lots of babies
sw2474B-ms98-a-0099 528.874875 539.829000 lot of little baby African Violets and stuff because i break off a leaf and i start them_1 off of leaves and stuff oh yeah yeah they're and they're they're you just stick them_1 in some soil
sw2474B-ms98-a-0100 539.829000 543.584375 and you kind of cover it up with a plastic bag or something with little holes in it
sw2474B-ms98-a-0101 543.584375 556.996500 but i[t]- because_1 it creates a kind of a little greenhouse when you do that and it keeps the humidity high and after about three or four weeks it's already established a root system and you can take the little baggy thing off and then just keep watering it and after about_1 about eight weeks
sw2474B-ms98-a-0102 556.996500 561.457250 after you take off the plastic bag you'll see leaves coming out
sw2474B-ms98-a-0103 561.457250 570.252125 and uh it'll it'll grow leaves and you've got sometimes you've got more than one plant you'll have several plants that will form off of that one leaf
sw2474B-ms98-a-0104 570.252125 572.014750 [silence]
sw2474B-ms98-a-0105 572.014750 581.162000 yeah it works great you know i've got and my problem [laughter-is] i've [laughter-got] [laughter-more] [laughter-than] [laughter-i] [laughter-know] what to do [laughter-with] [laughter-i've] [laughter-got] so many different varieties and stuff but i mean i've got
sw2474B-ms98-a-0106 581.162000 588.518500 i've got them_1 all in my eastern and i have one western window that i use and i use that for my babies
sw2474B-ms98-a-0107 588.518500 599.083250 and they do okay there but if i take a plant that's already established and i stick it in that western window it it causes a lot of problems with it but the babies do fine
