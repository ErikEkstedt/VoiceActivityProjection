sw2457A-ms98-a-0079 368.993875 373.441000 but it is like you say coming a little bit further up north
sw2457A-ms98-a-0080 373.441000 383.807250 it's a little bit nicer to have a Spring and a Fall season where you have some pleasant weather everyday where you can feel like you just want to open your windows and
