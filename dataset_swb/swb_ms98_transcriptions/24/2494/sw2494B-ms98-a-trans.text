sw2494B-ms98-a-0014 50.944375 56.006375 um-hum but that's what i do i always i vote in the national elections
sw2494B-ms98-a-0015 56.006375 67.393375 and i vote pretty much i i've been pretty good about voting in um most of um for like the for for mayor and for governor and and things like that and try to try to
sw2494B-ms98-a-0016 67.393375 78.756250 you know go through and figure out because_1 most of the people you don't a lot of them you don't have any knowledge of and just go in and just arbitrarily voting all Republican or all Democrat i try to i try to find out a little bit about them
sw2494B-ms98-a-0017 78.756250 83.722750 but i understand why i- i know one problem is uh
sw2494B-ms98-a-0018 83.722750 92.147250 why people don't don't register to vote i- i know some personally because in the past and i think that's been changed that
sw2494B-ms98-a-0019 92.147250 100.125750 that's how they get the jury uh rolls from from voter registration but i think that's going to be changed
sw2494B-ms98-a-0020 100.125750 113.209875 so i don't know if with that changing if uh you know if the voting will pick up but i think it's just like you say when you're if you're if you don't have an interest in something and you don't really care you may not go and vote
sw2494B-ms98-a-0021 113.209875 115.208625 but uh
sw2494B-ms98-a-0022 115.208625 118.734750 but uh wha[t]- what is it what was the percentage for national elections
sw2494B-ms98-a-0023 118.734750 121.359875 less than half
sw2494B-ms98-a-0024 121.359875 123.995125 that that surprises me too
sw2494B-ms98-a-0025 123.995125 125.054625 [silence]
sw2494B-ms98-a-0026 125.054625 126.186625 hm

sw2494B-ms98-a-0032 152.288250 158.542875 so uh the campaign that you worked when he was running for governor and that and he was elected that time
sw2494B-ms98-a-0033 158.542875 159.598875 [silence]
sw2494B-ms98-a-0034 159.598875 172.598625 yeah it's i- i would imagine it would be pretty i have uh a friend of mine whose her son-in-law is a judge and i've gone to a a few things with her
sw2494B-ms98-a-0035 172.598625 182.592250 and uh it's it's just like a different different world getting involved with those kinds with those with those people in politics so it is in[teresting]- very interesting

sw2494B-ms98-a-0040 191.727875 197.117125 what so do you think there's any what what could be done to improve the
sw2494B-ms98-a-0041 197.117125 199.623375 percent of voters
sw2494B-ms98-a-0042 199.623375 210.277875 [silence]

sw2494B-ms98-a-0047 229.089625 235.257500 i don't know well i know f[or]- for you know my son who is of voting age and 
sw2494B-ms98-a-0048 235.257500 244.351125 um he didn't want to he did he said he couldn't afford to be off from work because_1 they did not pay pay them for being off from work and that's why he didn't register but
sw2494B-ms98-a-0049 244.351125 255.879750 i- i wonder if that was really you know the real reason and then i know my daughter uh well she's twenty now but i got her a Voter Registration and gave it to her
sw2494B-ms98-a-0050 255.879750 260.969125 and i really don't think she ever turned it in but you know
sw2494B-ms98-a-0051 260.969125 267.908750 i just don't think it's important to to some people and maybe thing you know circumstances may change and
sw2494B-ms98-a-0052 267.908750 271.018250 but to get them interested in doing it i don't know
sw2494B-ms98-a-0053 271.018250 276.703375 [silence]
sw2494B-ms98-a-0054 276.703375 283.988875 maybe maybe a real campaign and you know just go vote [laughter-instead] of uh [vocalized-noise]
sw2494B-ms98-a-0055 283.988875 294.139250 [vocalized-noise] that maybe it you know just just to really really encourage people to to do it so maybe that's may[be]- that would help i'm sure
sw2494B-ms98-a-0056 294.139250 295.156750 [silence]
sw2494B-ms98-a-0057 295.156750 301.378625 unless a lot of the people who who who are eligible to vote have no transportation and and and
sw2494B-ms98-a-0058 301.378625 309.574500 you know not able to get there or or for whatever reason so uh i don't know
