sw2495A-ms98-a-0009 39.951750 49.349125 [silence]
sw2495A-ms98-a-0010 49.349125 56.662750 isn't that amazing it it looks so easy just slapping paint on i had an addition put on
sw2495A-ms98-a-0011 56.662750 64.548125 and um we and i decided because my inner room looked so dingy because i put these beautiful French doors in
sw2495A-ms98-a-0012 64.548125 74.975500 and so i decided okay i'll just you know have them paint this little room you know a little ten by ten dining area it took four days
sw2495A-ms98-a-0013 74.975500 80.812375 [laughter] and even the painter couldn't give me a good estimate he said well i'll be done this afternoon you know
sw2495A-ms98-a-0014 80.812375 93.587250 and pretty soon before you know it you know he's run into so many problems and it's just there's nothing there to be a problem i thought but um it just took him so much longer and
sw2495A-ms98-a-0015 93.587250 97.048750 and he was there to paint the French doors also
sw2495A-ms98-a-0016 97.048750 103.035875 um and if you've ever painted French doors which my husband just finally said he wasn't going to do [laughter]
sw2495A-ms98-a-0017 103.035875 107.857000 because it looked so formidable um then then just
sw2495A-ms98-a-0018 107.857000 108.308875 [laughter]
sw2495A-ms98-a-0019 108.308875 117.270375 we we got this painter and i just called him because i got a little ad out of the you know the {adcose} or whatever in the mail and uh
sw2495A-ms98-a-0020 117.270375 126.098625 you know just got this painter person over here and he said yeah i can finish it in a day oh right [laughter] so the whole project basically took a week [laughter]
sw2495A-ms98-a-0021 126.098625 127.250125 [laughter]
sw2495A-ms98-a-0022 127.250125 131.070500 funny and i go what makes you a professional [laughter-you] know
sw2495A-ms98-a-0023 131.070500 144.269500 how much you know more do you know than i know about this whole situation but he just kept painting on those French doors you know and each little um paint stroke you know the paint wasn't going on right is what it was
sw2495A-ms98-a-0024 144.269500 152.931250 so he had to redo them like three times before i was happy with them before he was happy you know that they even looked halfway decent and
sw2495A-ms98-a-0025 152.931250 159.472500 so it's just been painting yeah i mean hire a professional but that doesn't guarantee [laughter-anything] 
sw2495A-ms98-a-0026 159.472500 174.102000 [silence]
sw2495A-ms98-a-0027 174.102000 175.595625 right

sw2495A-ms98-a-0033 204.012625 207.791750 oh and that can make a difference too i mean
sw2495A-ms98-a-0034 207.791750 215.358500 and they bring the uh you know little samples and you've got like maybe five hundred well that's an exaggeration
sw2495A-ms98-a-0035 215.358500 224.171000 but there are just so many tints upon tints upon tints and you don't know what you to want to put up there and by the time it's on
sw2495A-ms98-a-0036 224.171000 233.296125 i i selected a what i thought was white and it was like you said you know it was blue blue cast to it and it looked awful on [laughter]
sw2495A-ms98-a-0037 233.296125 237.473625 so that was the next problem he had to redo that too i [laughter]
sw2495A-ms98-a-0038 237.473625 243.947875 this was a and it was a major project getting the money [laughter-together] to do it too by the end of the whole project but 
sw2495A-ms98-a-0039 243.947875 257.247625 you know we worked something out because he was kind of apologetic that it took so long he really came over here to paint i think because he kept offering to paint the outside of my house i don't think he did the interiors [laughter-very] [laughter-well] [laughter] 
sw2495A-ms98-a-0040 257.247625 258.939625 and yeah
