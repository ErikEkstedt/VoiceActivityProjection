sw2476B-ms98-a-0006 12.752750 17.753625 right and i have i mean i've seen some change like i know um
sw2476B-ms98-a-0007 17.753625 25.440500 when i was young most mothers pretty much were housewives and stayed at home with the kids and to me it seems like
sw2476B-ms98-a-0008 25.440500 35.479500 it's almost the opposite now where the the woman is working and and they you know take the children to child care or maybe they work part-time or something
sw2476B-ms98-a-0009 35.479500 37.743375 so that seems to be a pretty big change

sw2476B-ms98-a-0026 105.018500 106.419875 right
sw2476B-ms98-a-0027 106.419875 117.630750 well i know the choice to either work or to be a mother is probably pretty difficult because i think women just naturally tend to have those instincts that you you know you protected the children and you
sw2476B-ms98-a-0028 117.630750 130.472750 you want to be with the children yet there's so many material things to be had out there that a lot of people think oh but if we both work we can get a really big house and we can get two really nice cars we can take a vacation we can do this and
sw2476B-ms98-a-0029 130.472750 144.095750 and it's kind of almost expected of you anyway people kind of look down on on a you know the role of a woman as a housewife it's kind of like oh well you know she didn't go to college and she's just a housewife and that's all she does right
sw2476B-ms98-a-0030 144.095750 150.829875 right even though there's probably women with MBA's maybe even [laughter-PhD's] that are staying at home with the children um

sw2476B-ms98-a-0053 231.955875 238.383750 there's some TV show on now and i i i think i've seen it once i don't get to watch much TV but uh
sw2476B-ms98-a-0054 238.383750 247.326375 there's a TV show where the man is the one raising the kids and the wife is and i maybe they based it on that Mister Mom movie but uh
sw2476B-ms98-a-0055 247.326375 248.394500 [silence]
sw2476B-ms98-a-0056 248.394500 257.277500 but uh there there is a TV show out there i guess they're trying to gain you know more public acceptance of things like that because i know there are cases where that happens and

sw2476B-ms98-a-0062 264.199125 268.035375 right it's probably getting more and more accepted today in fact it seems like
sw2476B-ms98-a-0063 268.035375 277.341750 it's kind of almost like anything goes now you you're not too surprised on much of anything when you know the husband's the one at home raising the children the mother works that's not real surprising and

sw2476B-ms98-a-0067 284.903625 294.481750 yeah in fact i'm pretty sure TI has something like that because uh one of the area supervisors uh in my area as a matter of fact took off um
sw2476B-ms98-a-0068 294.481750 307.152000 for a couple of weeks when his wife had their baby now it might have been just to take care of her and the baby instead of having you know a a nurse or someone come in or whatever midwife or whatever you call it that they have for the first couple of weeks but
sw2476B-ms98-a-0069 307.152000 318.726625 but i don't know if he took that out of his vacation or if they really do have a pater[nity]- he put paternity leave up there but it might have just been him describing the fact that he was taking vacation [laughter-days] to go be a father for a little while i don't know
sw2476B-ms98-a-0070 318.726625 319.910500 but
sw2476B-ms98-a-0071 319.910500 321.985000 i'm not real sure how that goes

sw2476B-ms98-a-0077 344.656500 356.666125 right well people they in general are just getting married a lot later i'm still single so i'm sure i'll be one of those parents that's you know one of those women in her thirties when when i get around to to ever getting married and then having kids [laughter-so]
sw2476B-ms98-a-0078 356.666125 360.821250 that's uh i th[ink]- i think that's getting a little more common too

sw2476B-ms98-a-0085 380.719625 394.955000 i agree i think it also gives a woman a chance to if she does have a job and a career it gives the man and the wife both a chance to both be working and maybe save up some money and then it gives her a little more option if she wants to stay home with the children while they're young
sw2476B-ms98-a-0086 394.955000 408.434750 and be a mother for awhile and then once they've gotten to school age maybe she could go back to work so she's kind of got that option if if they wait till later they've saved up some money that it's not as difficult for her to stay at home with the kids and live off one income or something

sw2476B-ms98-a-0096 428.820750 432.030375 i seem to see more women in uh
sw2476B-ms98-a-0097 432.030375 437.419750 in leadership type roles and management positions in politics and
sw2476B-ms98-a-0098 437.419750 439.139500 yeah
sw2476B-ms98-a-0099 439.139500 448.145625 like the Mayor of Dallas is a woman and i'm sure that twenty years ago that never would have [laughter-happened] but yeah she's i think she's in her second term now so
sw2476B-ms98-a-0100 448.145625 454.785250 she's she's yeah this is her second term i think she's going to going to uh not going to run again after this but
sw2476B-ms98-a-0101 454.785250 466.478375 but uh we do and we have several council women that are women but you just start hearing more and more in fact oh the the Governor of Texas is a woman too [laughter] can't forget that one so Ann Richards
