sw2476A-ms98-a-0002 1.694375 8.773750 well what what do you think is the uh the main change in uh wha[t]- what generation are you i'm i'm thirty years old
sw2476A-ms98-a-0003 8.773750 13.715500 you're twenty nine okay so we're we're we're both uh children of the very early sixties

sw2476A-ms98-a-0014 37.301250 48.819250 yeah the family structure in general is being really restructured from one income to two incomes which means from one parent to two part-time parents if you're lucky [laughter] um
sw2476A-ms98-a-0015 48.819250 58.820000 i uh it's it's funny because_1 both of u[s]- both of us then were really just adolescents when when i think most of the major changes for adult women were going on
sw2476A-ms98-a-0016 58.820000 63.690625 in America i don't think changes are are still progressing but it seems to me that the uh
sw2476A-ms98-a-0017 63.690625 76.375125 really the seventies the early seventies was a period of the most change and if i had to be somewhat abstract about it it seems to be the major change has been that woman have acquired more choice
sw2476A-ms98-a-0018 76.375125 78.050000 uh
sw2476A-ms98-a-0019 78.050000 85.738625 i mean that's sort of the overall the meta the meta change as it were uh where that woman really have more of a choice now about what they do
sw2476A-ms98-a-0020 85.738625 87.022750 um
sw2476A-ms98-a-0021 87.022750 100.839625 of course they find that the choice creates its own hardships in a way because life is not quite as simple even if it is for your you know you can choose something you really want which is a wonderful thing but it does seem like an awful lot of my uh
sw2476A-ms98-a-0022 100.839625 106.808250 my adult women friends are anguishing over over some of these choices um

sw2476A-ms98-a-0030 140.118500 141.301750 right
sw2476A-ms98-a-0031 141.301750 144.201500 she just settled for that yeah
sw2476A-ms98-a-0032 144.201500 150.436000 [silence]
sw2476A-ms98-a-0033 150.436000 162.892375 well i only know i have my friends who have had children uh i only know one woman who's decided to go the quote unquote traditional route and i have a lot of respect for her because she made it as a real choice
sw2476A-ms98-a-0034 162.892375 170.827500 she really knew that she didn't have to do that but she decided that was what she wanted to do in her life and she wanted that role she's a she's a marvelous parent and
sw2476A-ms98-a-0035 170.827500 185.523000 and i you know i say all power to her because she's an example to me of someone who really does have the choice i feel that a lot of uh women don't well i i said they have the choice but they don't necessarily feel that they do because they no longer [vocalized-noise] feel like if they were to just be a parent
sw2476A-ms98-a-0036 185.523000 196.979625 rather than uh you know the sort of super woman success in the business world as well they would somehow be perceived as a failure in their own eyes or in others and and then you s[ee]- then it's not a choice anymore
sw2476A-ms98-a-0037 196.979625 198.097500 um
sw2476A-ms98-a-0038 198.097500 205.035625 and and frankly it's the way that men are um men don't have this choice you know they don't feel this choice um uh
sw2476A-ms98-a-0039 205.035625 216.404250 in most subcultures in America that that i've been exposed to if the man were to say uh no i've decided not to work i want to stay home and do the child rearing my wife has a good job and i want her to keep that
sw2476A-ms98-a-0040 216.404250 224.768875 and i'm going to i'm going to be the primary caretaker and you know and then then take care of the children because_1 we don't want to put them in day care and this and that i think most
sw2476A-ms98-a-0041 224.768875 231.051250 Americans would feel funny about that and maybe sort of feel like he isn't that success that he could have been
sw2476A-ms98-a-0042 231.051250 232.968250 so it's um

sw2476A-ms98-a-0050 256.864125 265.329500 oh yeah i've i knew people who did it years ago but they they were very apologetic about it because_1 you could tell they were used to people kind of going what are you doing that for you know

sw2476A-ms98-a-0053 276.862875 285.433000 i've seen more and more companies that have um parental leave not just maternity leave they can grant paternity leave as well as maternity leave

sw2476A-ms98-a-0066 321.805500 327.430750 yeah the other big change i see in in in woman's lives is um
sw2476A-ms98-a-0067 327.430750 328.654750 [laughter]
sw2476A-ms98-a-0068 328.654750 334.086375 to remain biological they uh women a[re]- because they have choice are having children much later in life
sw2476A-ms98-a-0069 334.086375 337.964500 uh i mean my friends who are having children are having them at age thirty
sw2476A-ms98-a-0070 337.964500 342.552750 and uh if i'd been a couple of generations ago they would have
sw2476A-ms98-a-0071 342.552750 345.681875 had kids running around by then
sw2476A-ms98-a-0072 345.681875 354.865875 [silence]
sw2476A-ms98-a-0073 354.865875 357.099500 yeah yeah [laughter]

sw2476A-ms98-a-0075 360.234250 374.836125 yeah i actually think i i'm i'm somewhat encouraged by that trend because after all people live longer lives now so it's not like you c[an]- you know it's not like you're going to uh you know pass away before your child is an adult i mean barring un[forseen]- you know unforeseen circumstances
sw2476A-ms98-a-0076 374.836125 381.504625 and i think most people make better parents when they're a little bit more mature i really do
sw2476A-ms98-a-0077 381.504625 394.535375 [silence]
sw2476A-ms98-a-0078 394.535375 395.798500 um-hum

sw2476A-ms98-a-0082 407.517125 409.732125 yeah yeah that's true
sw2476A-ms98-a-0083 409.732125 422.678750 so i guess i oh i'm pretty encouraged [laughter] i really am but then i'm a product of my generation i don't know i if i'd been born a hundred years ago and were looking at this time i might not like it but it sure seems nice to me
sw2476A-ms98-a-0084 422.678750 429.182375 uh i mean i have other things to complain about but in terms of uh woman's roles um things really seem a lot more flexible

sw2476A-ms98-a-0086 433.676625 440.840500 yeah i mean it's still still admittedly a a a small minority but but it's an improvement it really is
sw2476A-ms98-a-0087 440.840500 442.489375 oh really

sw2476A-ms98-a-0097 466.002125 471.928125 no it we don't get much Texas politics out in California to be honest [laughter]

sw2476A-ms98-a-0101 482.456250 483.923375 that's right
sw2476A-ms98-a-0102 483.923375 490.336875 although during during during the uh Presidential debates there was some really nasty patronizing
sw2476A-ms98-a-0103 490.336875 498.403125 stuff toward i mean i don't know if if you saw those but i thought she was treated badly a[t]- for being a woman frankly i really did by by uh [noise]
sw2476A-ms98-a-0104 498.403125 506.512875 [laughter] the then vice presidential candidates uh who really sort of i thought had a very demeaning attitude towards her
sw2476A-ms98-a-0105 506.512875 517.818375 and [laughter] it was sort of it was acceptable to say certain types of things to her that she couldn't say back that kind of thing which i i i i found myself getting really quite enraged about

sw2476A-ms98-a-0107 519.344125 527.575500 but really that's a previous generation i don't like it's harder to imagine people of our age doing that and not feeling really stupid
