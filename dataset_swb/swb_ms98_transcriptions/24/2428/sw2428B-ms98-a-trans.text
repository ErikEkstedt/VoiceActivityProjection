sw2428B-ms98-a-0002 1.786500 12.449750 i sure do i have an Amiga it's an old one thousand model but it's still compatible to the uh late model Amiga personal computers the three thousand and the two thousand even the five hundreds out now and i love it
sw2428B-ms98-a-0003 12.449750 14.595000 yeah how about_1 you you got one

sw2428B-ms98-a-0013 34.950000 42.631500 well you sure made a savings there i have never heard anything to beat that that's just terrific d[oes]- does is it IBM compatible type

sw2428B-ms98-a-0019 52.411250 58.264500 well if you ever decide to get a newer later model think about an Amiga because it's the slickest machine you've ever seen
sw2428B-ms98-a-0020 58.264500 72.430500 it's got four thousand ninety six color graphics it's got real-time animation capability there's a [vocalized-noise] world of games for it if you're into that but it can do word processing you can import pictures into your documents and uh it just does everything a PC can do but it does it better
sw2428B-ms98-a-0021 72.430500 76.045500 [silence]

sw2428B-ms98-a-0025 81.659000 88.012875 you did well i i venture to say your you and your kids if you have any would enjoy the Amiga better

sw2428B-ms98-a-0031 104.015625 105.693500 oh really
sw2428B-ms98-a-0032 105.693500 117.721875 i'll tell her [laughter] we're sure not staying with the PC su[bject]- subject too well are we [laughter] well how how how much memory you got have you got on your machine
sw2428B-ms98-a-0033 117.721875 123.342000 [vocalized-noise]
sw2428B-ms98-a-0034 123.342000 126.655625 oh yeah uh-huh

sw2428B-ms98-a-0043 152.336125 154.072125 well that's neat
sw2428B-ms98-a-0044 154.072125 165.027625 yeah i'd like to have a piece of software like that for my machine now on my machine i've got a microphone hooked up to it and i can digitize me and the wife and kids all talking and all that but i can hook a VCR up to it and take our picture
sw2428B-ms98-a-0045 165.027625 177.311500 and then then then if my parents had the same kind of computer which they don't they don't have a computer but if they did then they i could send them [vocalized-noise] all that on a floppy disk and it would play out for them right there on the computer and they could click it to see each next scene 
sw2428B-ms98-a-0046 177.311500 183.629000 but that's all possible to do on the Amiga and frankly my VCR camera cost more than my computer did
sw2428B-ms98-a-0047 183.629000 186.552500 but you can do all those sorts of things on the Amiga
sw2428B-ms98-a-0048 186.552500 187.865625 [silence]
sw2428B-ms98-a-0049 187.865625 197.681875 yeah well lot of people don't know about Amiga it's put out by Commodore they made the sixty four but this is a machine that they bought from a company that got started up in California
sw2428B-ms98-a-0050 197.681875 209.785375 yeah well they make the Amiga and uh not only that but the Amiga is Unix compatible so if anybody around there is using Unix and they want a cheap Unix work station that cost under about four to five hundred dollars then the Amiga runs Unix
sw2428B-ms98-a-0051 209.785375 213.713125 and uh besides uh being able to do all the other things i was telling you about
sw2428B-ms98-a-0052 213.713125 222.510625 it's a fantastic machine if you've got to have IBM compatibility they've got a card you can plug in and you can run IBM software but the machine is so powerful i don't need it
sw2428B-ms98-a-0053 222.510625 234.494750 uh i use a Sun work station at work but i'm i'm in the process of purchasing Amiga to use it as my desktop computer but research work though i use a Sun Sparc station
sw2428B-ms98-a-0054 234.494750 237.540000 [silence]
sw2428B-ms98-a-0055 237.540000 238.723125 are you
sw2428B-ms98-a-0056 238.723125 245.149625 [silence]
sw2428B-ms98-a-0057 245.149625 246.889250 uh-huh
sw2428B-ms98-a-0058 246.889250 254.447750 i know well see uh the the Sparc stations run about twelve thousand dollars in color and an Amiga runs only forty seven hundred in color
sw2428B-ms98-a-0059 254.447750 265.130875 so it makes a real nice cheap Unix compatible desktop work station and see i've got one at home and everything i run at work i can run at home by you know same sort of stuff and uh
sw2428B-ms98-a-0060 265.130875 275.886250 uh it really makes it quite nice it definitely does i have four and a half megabytes on my machine here at the house and uh sixty five megabyte Seagate hard disk and it rips
sw2428B-ms98-a-0061 275.886250 278.734125 [silence]
sw2428B-ms98-a-0062 278.734125 280.333000 the Amiga
sw2428B-ms98-a-0063 280.333000 290.526750 well because it's made by Commodore and uh most people all they know about is IBM compatible because_1 no most people in this country that know anything about computers don't know much but they do know about IBM
sw2428B-ms98-a-0064 290.526750 300.302000 so when the PC came on the market and then it was the first one on the market earlier than the Amiga was but when it came on the market people just naturally assumed that well if IBM makes it it should be the computer of my choice
sw2428B-ms98-a-0065 300.302000 306.412375 and they intend to look around very much so as a result Macintoshes and and uh Amigas didn't get a fair break
sw2428B-ms98-a-0066 306.412375 321.278500 where but honestly an Amiga is far and away a much better PC than the PC will ever be it has a full multitasking operating system during the Christmas holidays while my kids played games with my machines i backed up my hard disk because i used my Commodore sixty four as a terminal to it like a main frame
sw2428B-ms98-a-0067 321.278500 335.261000 so i was copying files off my hard disk to floppies and they were playing a game using the uh joy sticks and they never even knew i was there except i was sitting there and i was pushing another floppy into this little slot uh while they were doing their thing to keep copying files out
sw2428B-ms98-a-0068 335.261000 338.511875 you can't do it on any machine a Mac or anything made
sw2428B-ms98-a-0069 338.511875 347.143875 yeah it's kind of neat not to mention the fact that it's got four thousand ninety six colors and you can't get more than two fifty six out of a PC or a Mac either one
sw2428B-ms98-a-0070 347.143875 348.539125 [silence]
sw2428B-ms98-a-0071 348.539125 361.469875 yeah that's right i can do that exactly [laughter] you sure can you can network them together and everything it's a fantastic machine needless to say so i'm very uh high on it but you said you have comp[uters]- Suns at work right what other machines do you all have at work
sw2428B-ms98-a-0072 361.469875 363.476000 [silence]
sw2428B-ms98-a-0073 363.476000 365.063250 uh-huh
sw2428B-ms98-a-0074 365.063250 366.970500 [silence]
sw2428B-ms98-a-0075 366.970500 380.366000 i see well tell them to look at the Amiga a lot of people think it's a toy and a game machine but it is a most powerful work station all the way around multitasking and i mean a real-time multitasking operating system and computer made
sw2428B-ms98-a-0076 380.366000 384.684250 [silence]
sw2428B-ms98-a-0077 384.684250 385.946500 uh-huh
sw2428B-ms98-a-0078 385.946500 386.954500 [silence]
sw2428B-ms98-a-0079 386.954500 392.247250 not only that but this machine can be hooked up to a regular TV set and you can do video presentations with it
sw2428B-ms98-a-0080 392.247250 401.019500 it has all kinds of software you can use that Commodore makes called Amiga Vision so that you can take pictures in and then you can make up your own video presenta[tion]- Hewlett Packard uses it
sw2428B-ms98-a-0081 401.019500 412.903500 Hewlett Packards makes PC's and they use the Amiga to do video presentations and um uh campaigns educational type uh presentations for the engineers in[cidentally]- incidentally Bausch and Lomb uses it too
sw2428B-ms98-a-0082 412.903500 414.262500 sure
sw2428B-ms98-a-0083 414.262500 418.089750 [silence]
sw2428B-ms98-a-0084 418.089750 419.555250 uh-huh
sw2428B-ms98-a-0085 419.555250 426.352500 [silence]
sw2428B-ms98-a-0086 426.352500 436.816875 well what you would do in the case of the Amiga is you'd use NTSC output that you can get on the machine put it right out to a uh vi[deo]- video tape and just cut you a video tape by uh by running it
sw2428B-ms98-a-0087 436.816875 445.407625 to the video tape because all the sound and graphics that it produces can be put right out of the back of the machine to a common VCR and recorded on a VHS tape
sw2428B-ms98-a-0088 445.407625 451.499750 [silence]
sw2428B-ms98-a-0089 451.499750 458.901250 yeah if you wanted to you could uh but you could do the whole presentation and slick it up and edit it and make all kinds of changes and modification till you had it down pat
sw2428B-ms98-a-0090 458.901250 469.860875 on the Amiga once you had done that i mean including hooking up a camera to take pictures of things like maybe you want to do a a a a presentation on how to run some piece of gear well you want to take pictures of it you might want to take pictures of it running
sw2428B-ms98-a-0091 469.860875 472.582000 because you can put more than one frame into the machine
sw2428B-ms98-a-0092 472.582000 486.782250 and then you can describe what's going on you can record it via {microphoning} machine then there's a way to link all that together and once you got it satisfied satisfactory done you can then take it and play it back out of the machine right out the NTSC port in the back to a VCR and record it
sw2428B-ms98-a-0093 486.782250 499.634500 after that you can put it all on floppy disk it might take several and between on how big a space you're talking about and uh carry it to another facility if they happen to own an Amiga well you slap it on there put it on their hard disk and away you go
sw2428B-ms98-a-0094 499.634500 501.347000 [silence]
sw2428B-ms98-a-0095 501.347000 511.630125 for what to do it well the parts or the machines depending on wha[t]- well you can get a two thousand which is uh a bare essential machine to do this with for about twenty three hundred dollars
sw2428B-ms98-a-0096 511.630125 519.878750 and uh then you would uh with some add on options and things you'd have to have probably the outside price at the max would be about thirty five thirty six hundred dollars
sw2428B-ms98-a-0097 519.878750 528.734625 if unless you want to use a video [vocalized-noise] to to do all kind of weird things like wipes and and fades and things like that which the uh TV people use 
sw2428B-ms98-a-0098 528.734625 534.723250 okay well if you don't need that which is really fancy and that has twenty four bit or sixteen million colors
sw2428B-ms98-a-0099 534.723250 548.601125 if you don't need that that's another fifteen hundred dollars and that's made by a commercial company just for the Amiga IBM and Mac both tried to get them to make it for their machines but they can't because the Amiga's the only PC on the market that has special graphics and sound
sw2428B-ms98-a-0100 548.601125 562.351625 and peripheral handling chips inside and that's why it can be a multitask operating system and not and handle num[erous]- multiple jobs at once because it has three co-processor chips in there that help out the main CPU and off load it from doing the graphics
sw2428B-ms98-a-0101 562.351625 570.386500 see the CPU in my machine is a little old sixty eight thousand and it loafs because there's three co-processors chips in my machine to handle the graphics
sw2428B-ms98-a-0102 570.386500 582.349125 uh the color graphics one co-processor chips handles all the sounds and it can make it has four channels of sound two of them come right out the back as stereo ports i have mine hooked up to my stereo down stairs has excellent stereo
sw2428B-ms98-a-0103 582.349125 590.245000 dynamic range and it has a third chip in it that has all your peripherals so that if i were to copy a file from my hard disk to the floppy
sw2428B-ms98-a-0104 590.245000 599.978250 then the CPU just goes out and tells Paula that's the chip that does peripheral handling copy this file from the hard disk to the floppy and the CPU goes off and does something else because
