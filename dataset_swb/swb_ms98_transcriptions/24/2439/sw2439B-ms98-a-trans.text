sw2439B-ms98-a-0002 3.995750 16.268375 well we've uh we've we've test driven the Oldsmobile Delta eighty eight and a a Cutlass Supreme and a used Cadillac about three or four years old
sw2439B-ms98-a-0003 16.268375 18.173500 because_1 uh
sw2439B-ms98-a-0004 18.173500 26.225625 i get married in a couple of weeks and i have two kids and my fiancee has two kids so we need we need a car that's big enough for six
sw2439B-ms98-a-0005 26.225625 28.488625 [silence]
sw2439B-ms98-a-0006 28.488625 37.518625 and so tha[t]- we went i guess it was two weekends ago we went uh car shopping and looked around uh
sw2439B-ms98-a-0007 37.518625 42.993000 [noise] we found something interesting at Crest Oldsmobile Cadillac up there on Central Expressway
sw2439B-ms98-a-0008 42.993000 44.988375 that uh
sw2439B-ms98-a-0009 44.988375 45.995625 [silence]
sw2439B-ms98-a-0010 45.995625 53.984750 in addition to to getting a new car there they can get you a car that's new but it's been uh a demonstrator model
sw2439B-ms98-a-0011 53.984750 59.279625 for uh two or three thousand dollars even cheaper than the best deal they can give you
sw2439B-ms98-a-0012 59.279625 60.987625 for a new car
sw2439B-ms98-a-0013 60.987625 66.000000 so they call this program cars and they come with a new car warranty
sw2439B-ms98-a-0014 66.000000 71.720750 and it just seems to make sense to me to get the most car for your money to get something like that
sw2439B-ms98-a-0015 71.720750 79.744375 [silence]
sw2439B-ms98-a-0016 79.744375 81.239875 uh-huh
sw2439B-ms98-a-0017 81.239875 82.995000 [silence]
sw2439B-ms98-a-0018 82.995000 84.493750 okay
sw2439B-ms98-a-0019 84.493750 86.227125 yeah
sw2439B-ms98-a-0020 86.227125 87.490625 uh-huh
sw2439B-ms98-a-0021 87.490625 89.185125 [silence]
sw2439B-ms98-a-0022 89.185125 90.610000 sure
sw2439B-ms98-a-0023 90.610000 93.499875 [silence]
sw2439B-ms98-a-0024 93.499875 94.848250 oh yeah
sw2439B-ms98-a-0025 94.848250 96.622625 [silence]
sw2439B-ms98-a-0026 96.622625 98.565375 yeah i think so too
sw2439B-ms98-a-0027 98.565375 102.981875 [silence]
sw2439B-ms98-a-0028 102.981875 112.965000 well the the ones that we were test driving were the uh were the new ones there um-hum well now um
sw2439B-ms98-a-0029 112.965000 118.966375 now they may be the demonstrator models but that the sales reps drive around in
sw2439B-ms98-a-0030 118.966375 124.481000 [silence]
sw2439B-ms98-a-0031 124.481000 131.982625 yeah it was in eighty eight the guy said it'd been on the lot about thirty minutes he says it'll probably be gone in a day and it's probably gone by now
sw2439B-ms98-a-0032 131.982625 133.643000 those things go fast
sw2439B-ms98-a-0033 133.643000 134.764875 [silence]
sw2439B-ms98-a-0034 134.764875 136.137500 um
sw2439B-ms98-a-0035 136.137500 147.740375 of course we['re]- we're not we can't consider getting a brand new Cadillac because_1 those are twenty twenty five to thirty thousand dollars but when they're three years old they're the price already drops in half
sw2439B-ms98-a-0036 147.740375 151.969500 so then it becomes uh more realistic
sw2439B-ms98-a-0037 151.969500 157.693125 [silence]
sw2439B-ms98-a-0038 157.693125 158.990375 uh-huh

sw2439B-ms98-a-0042 173.489000 176.926250 that's right that's right
sw2439B-ms98-a-0043 176.926250 178.467375 [silence]
sw2439B-ms98-a-0044 178.467375 190.144000 well you can reduce that risk by uh having the car checked out i mean you know y[ou]- y[ou]- if you're going to look at fifty different cars you don't want to do this but if you've narrowed it down to one or two
sw2439B-ms98-a-0045 190.144000 204.495000 you can have the car uh uh checked at uh an independent service station and have them go through it from top to bottom and tell you if they can find anything wrong because they don't have any financial interest in it
sw2439B-ms98-a-0046 204.495000 207.997125 and then you'll have a realistic assessment of what you're getting
sw2439B-ms98-a-0047 207.997125 210.490875 [silence]
sw2439B-ms98-a-0048 210.490875 214.501000 oh i'm thinking around twenty or twenty five dollars
sw2439B-ms98-a-0049 214.501000 216.495500 no huh-uh
sw2439B-ms98-a-0050 216.495500 218.223000 [silence]
sw2439B-ms98-a-0051 218.223000 220.735000 i- i would i would think so

sw2439B-ms98-a-0053 227.482250 229.483000 isn't that a good feeling

sw2439B-ms98-a-0057 246.988875 255.464625 well what you can do is take your car payment and put it in the bank for for three or four years and when you're ready to get another car just pay cash for it
sw2439B-ms98-a-0058 255.464625 256.980250 yeah

sw2439B-ms98-a-0075 314.480875 317.799375 that's right that's right
sw2439B-ms98-a-0076 317.799375 320.150000 [silence]
sw2439B-ms98-a-0077 320.150000 321.783125 eventually
sw2439B-ms98-a-0078 321.783125 333.978125 yeah the first two cars i ever bought um well uh i've i've bought three cars and i've i've always bought them new the first car i kept for thirteen and a half years and got a hundred and sixty one thousand out of it
sw2439B-ms98-a-0079 333.978125 342.717500 the second car i ever bought i drive to work now that just turned ten years old and i've got a hundred and twenty two thousand miles on that
sw2439B-ms98-a-0080 342.717500 348.997750 so that that's kind of been the way i've done things is to get things that are new and then keep them forever
sw2439B-ms98-a-0081 348.997750 350.710750 [silence]
sw2439B-ms98-a-0082 350.710750 352.724250 but uh
sw2439B-ms98-a-0083 352.724250 357.008875 my car is is using two quarts of oil a week now
sw2439B-ms98-a-0084 357.008875 359.988125 about about a quart every hundred miles
sw2439B-ms98-a-0085 359.988125 370.822875 so uh but uh but i mean it runs fine all you have it's just very thirsty if i just keep the oil in it seems to be okay but you know that's that's a sign that i'm going to have to do something sooner or later
sw2439B-ms98-a-0086 370.822875 372.480500 [silence]
sw2439B-ms98-a-0087 372.480500 374.987875 it's a a Buick Century
sw2439B-ms98-a-0088 374.987875 377.674625 [silence]
sw2439B-ms98-a-0089 377.674625 386.729125 uh no my fiance is selling uh a nineteen seventy eight Cutlass Supreme that she has it's actually in better condition than my car

sw2439B-ms98-a-0091 388.497375 396.499000 and so she's going to get some money for that and take some money from the bank and then try to make as much down payment as possible to keep the monthly payment low
sw2439B-ms98-a-0092 396.499000 398.992375 [silence]
sw2439B-ms98-a-0093 398.992375 404.494500 yeah um y[ou]- you lose four to six hundred dollars a trade in
