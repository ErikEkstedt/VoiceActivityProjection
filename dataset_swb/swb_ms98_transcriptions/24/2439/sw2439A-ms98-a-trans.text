sw2439A-ms98-a-0020 70.757500 76.786625 right that's a real good deal in fact my dad recently got a um
sw2439A-ms98-a-0021 76.786625 80.961500 [noise] a Pontiac uh believe six thousand
sw2439A-ms98-a-0022 80.961500 90.216250 and he got a a demo and it's been a real good car and it's it's like new and it only had had very very low mileage on it
sw2439A-ms98-a-0023 90.216250 96.935250 and so he i think he got a real good deal of course they're fully loaded usually and so it's a i think it's a pretty good option
sw2439A-ms98-a-0024 96.935250 97.996125 [silence]
sw2439A-ms98-a-0025 97.996125 103.991750 are the uh Oldsmobiles that you're looking at are they the demos or they used are they new [laughter]

sw2439A-ms98-a-0040 150.988250 164.957250 right that's what i'm thinking about on my next car is do i want to get another brand new car because_1 my last two cars are brand new or do i want to look for a used car that's maybe two three years old that's in you know low mileage and in good shape
sw2439A-ms98-a-0041 164.957250 178.997125 but i just i kind of worry about getting a car that's that new with low mileage on it because you wonder why did the person that owned it want to get rid of it is it a lemon [laughter-or] is something wrong with it but i guess that's a risk you have to take
sw2439A-ms98-a-0042 178.997125 187.308750 [silence]

sw2439A-ms98-a-0052 213.504750 215.704750 yeah that's not bad
sw2439A-ms98-a-0053 215.704750 221.458875 it'd be well worth it if you're considering buying a car [laughter] to find out yeah
sw2439A-ms98-a-0054 221.458875 235.287625 yeah well it's kind of hard for me to talk about buying cars because i just got mine paid off about a month ago and i yes i don't want to think about buying a car for a while i just want to enjoy not having any car payments for a while and
sw2439A-ms98-a-0055 235.287625 247.822625 and enjoy watching my savings account get larger and uh you know hang on to the one i've got for a few years because it's it's it's almost four years old but it's still in great shape i have a Mazda RX7

sw2439A-ms98-a-0059 254.241875 268.999750 yeah i just about could really because i think my car if i continue taking good care of it it's going to hold a pretty good resale value and uh that if i consider going the used car route and save up some money i shouldn't have too much trouble at all
sw2439A-ms98-a-0060 268.999750 271.306250 [silence]
sw2439A-ms98-a-0061 271.306250 274.486000 could you hold on for just a moment okay [noise]
sw2439A-ms98-a-0062 274.486000 287.494750 [noise] okay i'm on a cordless phone and i was picking up uh some background noise so i just switched the channel up on it i didn't want to interfere with whatever they're trying to record so [laughter] anyway
sw2439A-ms98-a-0063 287.494750 289.202375 [silence]
sw2439A-ms98-a-0064 289.202375 301.472375 but uh i really i really enjoy the car i have now and i do want to hold onto it and and uh you know enjoy it while it's it's not having any mechanical problems whatso[ever]- in fact it never has and uh
sw2439A-ms98-a-0065 301.472375 307.727625 it's been kind of nice and i surprisingly enough after four years i'm not tired of the car at all and um
sw2439A-ms98-a-0066 307.727625 317.238000 i'll just hang on to it while it's still being a good car and while i'm not tired of it and while i'm single and can handle a two seater for now [laughter] and get that out of my system
sw2439A-ms98-a-0067 317.238000 322.742875 because one of these days i'll be getting a six seater probably too so [laughter] um

sw2439A-ms98-a-0083 370.218250 372.997875 right what kind of car is it
sw2439A-ms98-a-0084 372.997875 374.146750 [silence]
sw2439A-ms98-a-0085 374.146750 377.989375 um-hum are you going to trade it in on this new one or
sw2439A-ms98-a-0086 377.989375 383.703125 [silence]
sw2439A-ms98-a-0087 383.703125 385.673500 okay
sw2439A-ms98-a-0088 385.673500 387.154500 uh-huh

sw2439A-ms98-a-0090 394.249875 395.994125 um-hum
sw2439A-ms98-a-0091 395.994125 401.991625 so she's going to sell it rather than trade it in that's probably the best thing
sw2439A-ms98-a-0092 401.991625 403.996750 [silence]
sw2439A-ms98-a-0093 403.996750 418.195500 or maybe more than that as i've [laughter-learned] yeah when i bought my RX7 i uh best offer i got for my other car was twenty five hundred well i turned around and sold it myself for forty two hundred so
sw2439A-ms98-a-0094 418.195500 432.499500 you can do much better i'm glad you're you're taking care of it yourself i- i think trading it in they they just use that as additional they may give you supposedly a better deal on your new car you're buying but they just are going to give you that much less for your trade in 
sw2439A-ms98-a-0095 432.499500 434.682875 that's what i think so
sw2439A-ms98-a-0096 434.682875 435.974625 [silence]
sw2439A-ms98-a-0097 435.974625 446.704125 but strangely enough the best off[er]- i mean the best bargaining i had made with a dealer on my car was also the same place i got the best price
sw2439A-ms98-a-0098 446.704125 458.483375 trade in but it's a place in Arlington and i think maybe [vocalized-noise] as you get outside the Dallas area i kind of i bet you it's kind of what i decided well maybe because it's outside of Dallas they are giving a little bit better
sw2439A-ms98-a-0099 458.483375 464.474875 prices plus i was going through the that TI fleet discount program
sw2439A-ms98-a-0100 464.474875 467.316625 [silence]
sw2439A-ms98-a-0101 467.316625 469.982250 um well it's before they had that
sw2439A-ms98-a-0102 469.982250 479.998625 i had gone over to Texins and they had a little file where they said which dealers participated in the in the fleet program and and what you could expect they said you know a five percent
sw2439A-ms98-a-0103 479.998625 485.763000 over cost and then options at cost and everything so i figured out a price based on that
sw2439A-ms98-a-0104 485.763000 495.407125 but i- i guess i got a pretty good deal because i went back to the Town North Mazda right off central and offered them the same price as what i knew i was gonna be able to get it for in Arlington
sw2439A-ms98-a-0105 495.407125 506.837500 and they said there is no way you can get this car for that price especially if we add on the equalizer and the and the cruise control he said you're going to get a car that's got flood damage or hail damage and they just laughed at me
sw2439A-ms98-a-0106 506.837500 518.766500 and i went the next morning to Arlington and they gave it to me for that price and what's so funny is they took the car they i knew they were gonna pull it from Town North because that's where the white one was and they had already told me we located one at Town North so it was that same car
sw2439A-ms98-a-0107 518.766500 525.996000 and i said like yeah well unless you're selling car with hail damage and flood damage [laughter] i got the car off your lot for that price [laughter]
sw2439A-ms98-a-0108 525.996000 530.977125 oh i did and i laughed real hard when i took it in for the two thousand mile checkup and uh
sw2439A-ms98-a-0109 530.977125 545.446125 that they required you to do and i took it to Town North and sure enough i saw that guy and he recognized me he s[aid]- he said oh hi Dana and he kind of looked down and saw that car and i- and i'm sure he probably knew what was going on the very next day of course when when the place in Arlington
sw2439A-ms98-a-0110 545.446125 552.295375 went and took the car because i told him there's a place in Arlington that's gonna give it to me for that price he said no they're not and the next day they
sw2439A-ms98-a-0111 552.295375 559.743125 pulled the white car and took it to Arlington so i'm sure he knew [laughter] so i loved it i sat there and i just had the biggest grin on my face
sw2439A-ms98-a-0112 559.743125 561.682250 is kind of nice but
sw2439A-ms98-a-0113 561.682250 563.501875 [silence]
