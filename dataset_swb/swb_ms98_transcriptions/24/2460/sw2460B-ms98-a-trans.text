sw2460B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 8.021625 [silence]
sw2460B-ms98-a-0002 8.021625 9.994125 well what are the others
sw2460B-ms98-a-0003 9.994125 20.416125 [silence]
sw2460B-ms98-a-0004 20.416125 22.397125 well it's helpful
sw2460B-ms98-a-0005 22.397125 31.610250 [silence]
sw2460B-ms98-a-0006 31.610250 35.160875 well do you keep up with the statistical stuff
sw2460B-ms98-a-0007 35.160875 45.723875 [silence]
sw2460B-ms98-a-0008 45.723875 60.021625 well there's there's a guy on that was on Norm Hisken's show that i listen to going to work in the morning who does uh uh it's essentially trivial statistics but they've got a st[atistic]- it's a statistic that has to do with winning
sw2460B-ms98-a-0009 60.021625 63.243500 and losing one run games
sw2460B-ms98-a-0010 63.243500 69.454250 and apparently the Rangers last year won a lot of one run games
sw2460B-ms98-a-0011 69.454250 70.875125 [silence]
sw2460B-ms98-a-0012 70.875125 75.445250 well it it it is but it's the it's it's a reverse indicator
sw2460B-ms98-a-0013 75.445250 80.284875 [silence]
sw2460B-ms98-a-0014 80.284875 93.607125 well what the what the argument is and it it it it's one of these statistical gee how can you draw a conclusion from it but they find that tha[t]- tha[t]- there's a connection between that and how they do in Spring training the following year
sw2460B-ms98-a-0015 93.607125 100.518250 and uh it's strangely enough it's almost like the law of averages catches you on the following year
sw2460B-ms98-a-0016 100.518250 105.874125 which means that if you have a good year winning one ru[n]- one run games that the following year
sw2460B-ms98-a-0017 105.874125 111.257250 you'll have a bad year and they they've got um they've looked at i think twenty three teams
sw2460B-ms98-a-0018 111.257250 122.541250 uh and and the uh the statistics are something like twenty one out of twenty three it was which means that the Rangers are going to have a terrible year i th[ink]-
sw2460B-ms98-a-0019 122.541250 129.389875 well i mean and it's uh i don't know what do you what do you think of Incaviglia's uh loss
sw2460B-ms98-a-0020 129.389875 158.637875 [silence]
sw2460B-ms98-a-0021 158.637875 168.839000 well it it's an interesting concept though when you look at uh of of how baseball how apparently i was reading in the paper tonight that the Detroit Tigers are going to sign him
sw2460B-ms98-a-0022 168.839000 176.263500 and uh and the point of of i- i guess i don't understand the the strategy of how baseball works but it seems that
sw2460B-ms98-a-0023 176.263500 188.649625 you know they can sign him tomorrow and he could go in the team the next day and and and they put him in the lineup and he hits a home run and all of a sudden he becomes a hero and and all he has to do is hit the ball i mean it's not 
sw2460B-ms98-a-0024 188.649625 200.016500 a[nd]- and all he has to do is one you know hit it once it doesn't he can he can stri[ke]- he can swing a couple times if he if he fouls it up he can swing as much as he can it's an interesting uh
sw2460B-ms98-a-0025 200.016500 206.056250 an interesting concept of of how they do that but i agree with you i think that i think that's part of what
sw2460B-ms98-a-0026 206.056250 217.177000 uh baseball needs more of i uh i i guess what bothers me is is that when you go um you wait and wait and wait and finally a guy gets up there and blast a home run
sw2460B-ms98-a-0027 217.177000 221.236875 and that's all the game is i'd rather see the ball hit around and
sw2460B-ms98-a-0028 221.236875 223.014375 have the people
sw2460B-ms98-a-0029 223.014375 236.581750 [silence]
sw2460B-ms98-a-0030 236.581750 238.013250 yes
sw2460B-ms98-a-0031 238.013250 250.539000 [silence]
sw2460B-ms98-a-0032 250.539000 253.885250 yeah well how do you think the Royals are going to do
sw2460B-ms98-a-0033 253.885250 274.144125 [silence]
sw2460B-ms98-a-0034 274.144125 277.186875 well are they going to beat are they going to beat Oakland
sw2460B-ms98-a-0035 277.186875 289.504000 [silence]
sw2460B-ms98-a-0036 289.504000 291.060125 yeah
sw2460B-ms98-a-0037 291.060125 293.583500 [silence]
sw2460B-ms98-a-0038 293.583500 303.039250 well i go to Saint Louis from time to time and i watch i i watch their sports up there and they're uh they're they're certainly intense about the Cardinals they
sw2460B-ms98-a-0039 303.039250 305.021500 [silence]
sw2460B-ms98-a-0040 305.021500 307.597375 y[ou]- did you actually live in Saint Louis
sw2460B-ms98-a-0041 307.597375 308.986500 [silence]
sw2460B-ms98-a-0042 308.986500 311.068750 ye[ah]- everybody does right
sw2460B-ms98-a-0043 311.068750 313.759125 [silence]
sw2460B-ms98-a-0044 313.759125 322.503000 i had a friend from college that lives in uh yeah it's well i should say on the west side i mean everything's on the west side Manchester
sw2460B-ms98-a-0045 322.503000 329.218500 uh out that way and uh went and visited him but anyway it is interesting well how are the Cardinals do you still keep up with them or something
sw2460B-ms98-a-0046 329.218500 341.116500 [silence]
sw2460B-ms98-a-0047 341.116500 343.257375 well is that a good indicator
sw2460B-ms98-a-0048 343.257375 373.861000 [silence]
sw2460B-ms98-a-0049 373.861000 386.139375 you know what i think's remarkable is uh it seems that what you really need to do to win though is to have a team that has reasonable talent and has some people that have have have really breakthrough years
sw2460B-ms98-a-0050 386.139375 393.716000 and and the question is how do you forecast that if you had to you know if you had to bet on who would be in the World Series i mean it'd be really tough
sw2460B-ms98-a-0051 393.716000 407.434500 [silence]
sw2460B-ms98-a-0052 407.434500 408.930250 yeah
sw2460B-ms98-a-0053 408.930250 418.389750 [silence]
sw2460B-ms98-a-0054 418.389750 419.633375 yeah
sw2460B-ms98-a-0055 419.633375 420.991250 [silence]
sw2460B-ms98-a-0056 420.991250 424.013500 well well when are the Rangers going to come through with it
sw2460B-ms98-a-0057 424.013500 439.868375 [silence]
sw2460B-ms98-a-0058 439.868375 449.616000 well is there enough money that's part of it i oh oh that was part of Skip Bayless argument i don't know if you read Skip Bayless but a a a local commentary and
sw2460B-ms98-a-0059 449.616000 459.064375 his argument is that uh the ownership is not inclined to lose big money long enough to to bring in the big dollars
sw2460B-ms98-a-0060 459.064375 461.682625 would you would you agree with that
sw2460B-ms98-a-0061 461.682625 476.094875 [silence]
sw2460B-ms98-a-0062 476.094875 477.349625 uh
sw2460B-ms98-a-0063 477.349625 481.323125 [silence]
sw2460B-ms98-a-0064 481.323125 482.801750 yeah
sw2460B-ms98-a-0065 482.801750 485.388000 [silence]
sw2460B-ms98-a-0066 485.388000 490.740750 well didn't Kansas City put up quite a bit of money for their pitching staff
sw2460B-ms98-a-0067 490.740750 499.995375 [silence]
sw2460B-ms98-a-0068 499.995375 501.427875 yeah
sw2460B-ms98-a-0069 501.427875 515.504000 well and that i think that's maybe part of it that that the um and it you know if i owned the team i think you'd like them_1 to do well but the question of losing big big money that what didn't didn't did Steinbrenner actually make money on the
sw2460B-ms98-a-0070 515.504000 526.722375 [silence]
sw2460B-ms98-a-0071 526.722375 534.889750 well it it it yeah it's it's a little bit like any other sport you know when it starts costing you fifty to a hundred dollars to go to a game
sw2460B-ms98-a-0072 534.889750 548.148125 and uh you know i mean i i guess as we get older if you're probably going if if you if you compare to go to a a sport a a say you go to a rock concert or or even a performance uh
sw2460B-ms98-a-0073 548.148125 561.197750 an opera or the symphony or something uh if you know i[t]- but how how often do you do that and i i would i would think baseball probably feeds on a number of people that can go out there you know several times a
sw2460B-ms98-a-0074 561.197750 564.997875 [silence]
sw2460B-ms98-a-0075 564.997875 566.348375 yeah
sw2460B-ms98-a-0076 566.348375 586.209000 [silence]
sw2460B-ms98-a-0077 586.209000 599.029875 yeah but don't you think there's a the the there're older fans there i d[on't]- i don't mean older um you know the fact that that it's it's a better established and that the the city is is is more of a of a
