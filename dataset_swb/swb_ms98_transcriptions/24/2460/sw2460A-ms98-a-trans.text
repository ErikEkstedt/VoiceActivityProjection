sw2460A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 9.368625 [noise] all right well i have a lot of different teams that i like to to keep in touch with of course Texas Rangers being one of them_1 i mean uh you know you can't live in Dallas without you know
sw2460A-ms98-a-0002 9.368625 14.634500 well uh i originally came from Saint Louis so uh the Saint Louis Cardinals are one
sw2460A-ms98-a-0003 14.634500 28.839375 um i moved to Kansas City see i have i have a tendency to a[dopt]- adopt teams when i went go to a tea[m]- uh go to a town yeah so uh i lived in Kansas City for a couple years and i adopted the Royals i lived in Houston for two and a half years so i adopted the uh
sw2460A-ms98-a-0004 28.839375 32.470250 uh the Houston Astros so i mean you know i've got quite a few
sw2460A-ms98-a-0005 32.470250 34.338000 [silence]
sw2460A-ms98-a-0006 34.338000 47.936125 no i don't i don't get into that too much ev[ery]- every once in a while i will keep in in touch with maybe like who's in the top five of hitting or something like that but i don't get into you know how many errors somebody has or things like that
sw2460A-ms98-a-0007 47.936125 50.132250 [silence]

sw2460A-ms98-a-0012 61.870875 64.234000 i've heard of that one
sw2460A-ms98-a-0013 64.234000 68.419125 [silence]
sw2460A-ms98-a-0014 68.419125 72.450125 well i didn't know that that's supposed to be a real good statistic uh
sw2460A-ms98-a-0015 72.450125 74.253875 [silence]
sw2460A-ms98-a-0016 74.253875 81.447625 well that's true they don't have the offense to uh to get out or to have the the more runs so
sw2460A-ms98-a-0017 81.447625 92.579000 [silence]
sw2460A-ms98-a-0018 92.579000 93.851000 um-hum

sw2460A-ms98-a-0022 120.065375 124.142125 which i was kind of leaning toward anyway to tell you the truth
sw2460A-ms98-a-0023 124.142125 128.140000 [silence]
sw2460A-ms98-a-0024 128.140000 134.654875 i kind of think it was necessary i mean i i- i- i don't i'm not a a big um
sw2460A-ms98-a-0025 134.654875 145.310000 pure power hitter anyway i mean i don't like these guys that get up there and swing for the downs every time i mean uh i think that uh that a player ought to hit a home run if he's got the pitch to do it
sw2460A-ms98-a-0026 145.310000 160.068875 but when you get two strikes on you you have a tend[ency]- you know you should you know shorten your swing a little bit you know if it's a perfect shot go for it but i mean you know the strike outs were a big problem for him and uh plus supposedly what i heard he was not much of a team player anyway so
sw2460A-ms98-a-0027 160.068875 177.870125 [silence]
sw2460A-ms98-a-0028 177.870125 179.079875 um-hum

sw2460A-ms98-a-0030 184.907250 186.717750 yeah well that's true
sw2460A-ms98-a-0031 186.717750 191.288875 [silence]
sw2460A-ms98-a-0032 191.288875 192.575375 um-hum

sw2460A-ms98-a-0034 196.900875 198.265875 right
sw2460A-ms98-a-0035 198.265875 222.594000 [silence]
sw2460A-ms98-a-0036 222.594000 232.559625 yeah well there's there's another point to that too they said that um that he was horrible at uh at batting with with men on base now
sw2460A-ms98-a-0037 232.559625 247.005000 having somebody get up and hit a solo home run does you you know gives you one run obviously but i mean if you can't do it with men on base there's something definitely wrong um you know you you've got to be able to get the two and three run home runs you know to to be able to
sw2460A-ms98-a-0038 247.005000 252.438125 uh score enough runs to be able win in these uh in this day and age so
sw2460A-ms98-a-0039 252.438125 255.789500 i think the Royals will
sw2460A-ms98-a-0040 255.789500 261.225500 do okay they have they have several pitchers that had badly years last year and they are they're these
sw2460A-ms98-a-0041 261.225500 275.398625 uh cycle pitchers they they pitch one year bad one year good one beer bad one year good Saberhagen has won uh supposedly the Cy i think he won Cy year uh two out of three years and uh you know so he's very much due for a good year
sw2460A-ms98-a-0042 275.398625 276.985625 [silence]
sw2460A-ms98-a-0043 276.985625 285.045000 well now see that's a good question i that's i don't know how Oakland's going to react to being uh swept in the World Series last year they could very easily
sw2460A-ms98-a-0044 285.045000 294.604500 uh take that as a challenge which is the way most teams nat[urally]- you know naturally do uh and and just go out and and not give anybody a chance to beat them_1 so
sw2460A-ms98-a-0045 294.604500 298.046875 [silence]
sw2460A-ms98-a-0046 298.046875 299.315375 um-hum

sw2460A-ms98-a-0048 301.559000 305.886750 oh yeah baseball is there is there life up there like football is down here i think
sw2460A-ms98-a-0049 305.886750 306.942750 [silence]
sw2460A-ms98-a-0050 306.942750 310.052750 i lived in the suburbs of Saint Louis yeah
sw2460A-ms98-a-0051 310.052750 314.791750 [laughter-yeah] [laughter-that's] [laughter-true] [laughter-too] [laughter] i think that's all that they have
sw2460A-ms98-a-0052 314.791750 321.693375 [silence]
sw2460A-ms98-a-0053 321.693375 323.462125 um-hum

sw2460A-ms98-a-0055 324.713250 328.217125 [silence]
sw2460A-ms98-a-0056 328.217125 342.626625 yeah oh yeah i i definitely do in fact i've got family that still lives up there um from what i hear from everybody up there they're not going to have a good year because_1 they let too many people go but i've been following Spring training and they're like one of the best teams in spring training so far so
sw2460A-ms98-a-0057 342.626625 347.690625 that well it can be it it really kind of depends on on um
sw2460A-ms98-a-0058 347.690625 355.744375 what they were you know what they were looking for in other words if if in Spring [crain/training] training they were looking at all their kids like a lot of them_1 do
sw2460A-ms98-a-0059 355.744375 368.063875 um then it really doesn't give you any indication but if they were uh playing the people that they're going to play then that might be pretty good indication so you know it's it's it's not a great indication because there have been teams that have just
sw2460A-ms98-a-0060 368.063875 375.461000 you know come out and just won all kinds of games in Spring [craning/training] training and then gone on a you know fourteen game losing streak in the first of the season so
sw2460A-ms98-a-0061 375.461000 385.256625 [silence]
sw2460A-ms98-a-0062 385.256625 387.989750 exactly yeah
sw2460A-ms98-a-0063 387.989750 389.512125 you can't
sw2460A-ms98-a-0064 389.512125 392.751500 [silence]
sw2460A-ms98-a-0065 392.751500 399.392750 right th[e]- i think the best thing that you can do is go with um the players that are
sw2460A-ms98-a-0066 399.392750 405.075500 that have the talent to do the best years and um that they hadn't had these
sw2460A-ms98-a-0067 405.075500 419.026500 uh gigantic uh career years yet and and just kind of assume that you know s[omeone]- one of them_1 is going to break through eventually so and i i think they said the Reds um this last year i'm not sure that they said that they had that many people having career years
sw2460A-ms98-a-0068 419.026500 422.030875 you know and and so they may be even be[tter]- better this year
sw2460A-ms98-a-0069 422.030875 423.700000 [silence]
sw2460A-ms98-a-0070 423.700000 428.513000 uh that's a good question i the Rangers have a have a pitching problem
sw2460A-ms98-a-0071 428.513000 440.960250 and whether or not they can fix that or not is going to be an interesting question they're doing the right thing though uh they are going with their farm system they're letting their farm system uh build up and stuff like that and
sw2460A-ms98-a-0072 440.960250 444.070500 [silence]
sw2460A-ms98-a-0073 444.070500 445.452750 um-hum
sw2460A-ms98-a-0074 445.452750 446.794000 no
sw2460A-ms98-a-0075 446.794000 448.323875 [silence]
sw2460A-ms98-a-0076 448.323875 449.570750 um-hum
sw2460A-ms98-a-0077 449.570750 458.484875 [silence]
sw2460A-ms98-a-0078 458.484875 472.282625 um that's probably true well considering what i've seen in the last uh you know two seasons i'm beginning to agree with that yeah but i mean you don't have to spend the big money as far as i'm concerned to uh
sw2460A-ms98-a-0079 472.282625 486.228250 to win you just have to spend it if it's necessary in other words if you've got a player on your team who's helping your team then keep him there don't let him go away you know and i think that's really what's been hurting uh uh the uh Rangers
sw2460A-ms98-a-0080 486.228250 488.023625 [silence]
sw2460A-ms98-a-0081 488.023625 499.613375 oh yeah they they spent more money last year than any other team in the in the league and they were you know toward the bottom of the league uh so it's like i said spending money doesn't guarantee you uh winning a pennant
sw2460A-ms98-a-0082 499.613375 502.071375 it really doesn't so
sw2460A-ms98-a-0083 502.071375 515.310000 [silence]
sw2460A-ms98-a-0084 515.310000 528.213125 uh you got me i you know i think that there's coming to a point real soon when ticket prices are going to be to the point where the average fan can't go and once you do that you lose everything i mean
sw2460A-ms98-a-0085 528.213125 533.767750 [silence]
sw2460A-ms98-a-0086 533.767750 535.160250 um-hum

sw2460A-ms98-a-0092 560.241625 567.656125 that that's the whole point there're so many games in in a year that they've got to have repeat customers they can't afford not to and
sw2460A-ms98-a-0093 567.656125 577.939375 you know that's one of the things that i think Saint Louis has done um i mean their you know their ticket prices are you know kin[d]- i guess as high as anybody else's but what somehow or another they attract
sw2460A-ms98-a-0094 577.939375 587.401625 uh so many people from some i mean they're a s[ome]- it's a small market and yet they attract as many if not more than most uh uh most other cities so
