sw2490B-ms98-a-0002 1.460750 5.234250 well i'm kind of leaning towards
sw2490B-ms98-a-0003 5.234250 18.890000 i don't know i'm thinking about what from one to ten what my number would be it'd probably be somewhere closer to uh less control because_1 i don't see i'm not a member of the NRA although my father is but
sw2490B-ms98-a-0004 18.890000 28.978000 i i guess i believe i i think the NRA has gone overboard the wrong way you know they're sitting there on number ten sa[ying]- they're saying absolutely no gun control we don't even want to think about it and
sw2490B-ms98-a-0005 28.978000 42.744250 and i think that's a dumb situation because there has got to be some kind of background check to see that the people who are buying a gun are buying it for a useful purpose you know if if if you're going to hunt with it if you're going to do sport shooting you can wait a week
sw2490B-ms98-a-0006 42.744250 54.087125 it's not a big deal for them to go if they can check your drivers license every time you get a ticket you know i mean they should be able to go back and find out if you've had any kind of psychiatric record armed you know felony record you know
sw2490B-ms98-a-0007 54.087125 58.442250 any of that kind of stuff and it seems to me right now that there's not
sw2490B-ms98-a-0008 58.442250 64.464125 there's not that much of a check i i'm not really sure what Texas law i think there's a check for f[elonies]-
sw2490B-ms98-a-0009 64.464125 70.597500 for felonies on your record if the gun shop owner does it you know but
sw2490B-ms98-a-0010 70.597500 71.632500 [silence]
sw2490B-ms98-a-0011 71.632500 75.193125 yeah if y[ou]- and if it's a private sale of course then there's nothing
sw2490B-ms98-a-0012 75.193125 89.203875 [silence]
sw2490B-ms98-a-0013 89.203875 90.652250 um-hum

sw2490B-ms98-a-0015 98.030875 103.150750 yes but but maybe well prevent a few John Hinkleys
sw2490B-ms98-a-0016 103.150750 114.440000 you know i i that's that's the kind of people i like i say i don't think the guy who's going to rob a 7-Eleven is going to rob a 7-Eleven whether he has a gun or a knife baseball bat or you know whatever
sw2490B-ms98-a-0017 114.440000 115.850125 but
sw2490B-ms98-a-0018 115.850125 117.186125 you know
sw2490B-ms98-a-0019 117.186125 119.031875 [silence]
sw2490B-ms98-a-0020 119.031875 123.281875 yeah and and the people who want it it's not that big a deal like i said to wait
sw2490B-ms98-a-0021 123.281875 125.732125 [silence]
sw2490B-ms98-a-0022 125.732125 131.446125 [laughter-yeah] yeah it makes you wonder what they need it for all of a sudden here hum
sw2490B-ms98-a-0023 131.446125 134.770000 [silence]
sw2490B-ms98-a-0024 134.770000 143.757500 [laughter-yeah] i ima[gine]- i imagine his his opinion is a little bit towards the one there on the scale of one to ten he needs some more gosh if i was a cop i'd be
sw2490B-ms98-a-0025 143.757500 145.609500 [silence]
sw2490B-ms98-a-0026 145.609500 149.498125 too many people have too many too much access
sw2490B-ms98-a-0027 149.498125 157.568625 and i i guess i think the other thing that we ought to control to some extent is there should be some law against the types of gu[n]- i mean
sw2490B-ms98-a-0028 157.568625 167.090875 some of these Saturday night specials that these companies put out that are a piece of i mean they're they're basically it says here buy me and go rob a 7-Eleven that's
sw2490B-ms98-a-0029 167.090875 171.652000 [silence]
sw2490B-ms98-a-0030 171.652000 175.610250 yes they that's really gotten bad
sw2490B-ms98-a-0031 175.610250 179.099125 [silence]
sw2490B-ms98-a-0032 179.099125 186.888125 or your child accidently if your child is old enough t[o]- i mean there're a lot of kids who when they're ten look like they're twelve or fourteen or
sw2490B-ms98-a-0033 186.888125 198.523500 and and especially some of the minority children whether you know a racist or not that's the truth and and if some of them are doing something that they shouldn't be and then they have one of those toy guns in their hands and a cop comes up
sw2490B-ms98-a-0034 198.523500 202.997625 you can't jeez [noise] jeez and you can't take the chances the
sw2490B-ms98-a-0035 202.997625 209.868000 because_1 there's been kids that age who have killed people and you know you know there was a law in
sw2490B-ms98-a-0036 209.868000 222.637250 i think it's in Oregon where they've now made all toy gun[s]- they're they're making them_1 like neon colors you know yeah and the kids don't care my kid doesn't care he picks up a stick and goes bang so it [laughter-doesn't] make any difference to him
sw2490B-ms98-a-0037 222.637250 224.312250 yeah
sw2490B-ms98-a-0038 224.312250 225.649000 [silence]
sw2490B-ms98-a-0039 225.649000 236.612375 yeah so you ought to do i think they ought to do that with toy guns they ought to make them_1 very reasonably do something outrageous to them_1 you know so that they're not so that they're very distinguishable from a real gun
sw2490B-ms98-a-0040 236.612375 238.493500 yes
sw2490B-ms98-a-0041 238.493500 248.169125 [silence]

sw2490B-ms98-a-0050 285.150125 294.088000 that's kind of an odd thing i don't know i have a gun and i mean my folks have always had i learned to shoot when i was real little i think that's a lot of it too is that people
sw2490B-ms98-a-0051 294.088000 301.197375 need to teach their kids what not to what to do and what not to do because_1 i started shooting my dad
sw2490B-ms98-a-0052 301.197375 306.788375 started letting me shoot like a little air BB gun when i was probably five or six years old but
sw2490B-ms98-a-0053 306.788375 319.808750 you know it was this is how you hold it this is the only place that you do it which was you know out far and away and you don't ever touch it unless i'm here and you don't point it a[t]- at people and then they had then i went to the Texas
sw2490B-ms98-a-0054 319.808750 330.361625 Parks and Recreation i guess but anyway the s[afety]- hunter safety program that you have to do now i think it started in about nineteen seventy if you want if you want to go deer hunting and your birthday's after
sw2490B-ms98-a-0055 330.361625 338.622750 nineteen something fifty five or something then you have to g[o]- attend one of these hunter safety courses or you can't get a deer license
sw2490B-ms98-a-0056 338.622750 350.103500 and it and it's basic stuff it's like it's don't you know when you're climbing over a barbed wire fence don't point you don't lean your gun against it you know and you and then you crawl over it and have it shoot yourself and uh it
sw2490B-ms98-a-0057 350.103500 357.955500 those things happen i[t]- it it is always incredible to me the number of times those kind of stupid accidents happen to people
sw2490B-ms98-a-0058 357.955500 361.181250 [silence]
sw2490B-ms98-a-0059 361.181250 373.786375 yeah put the safety on the gun don't assume always assume it's loaded that's that's got to be the most common thing that people yeah it's oh it's empty it's empty boom you know [noise]
sw2490B-ms98-a-0060 373.786375 379.098000 yeah and i forgot about the one in the chamber [laughter] oh

sw2490B-ms98-a-0072 416.814375 428.516375 curi[ous]- yeah not something to be curious about and not something to be totally scared of if it if it's just one more piece of something but but they've got to understand like you said never touch it but yeah
sw2490B-ms98-a-0073 428.516375 432.203750 ours is a we have a shotgun and it's up in the closet
sw2490B-ms98-a-0074 432.203750 440.473000 and then the shells are in another part and i[t's]- sometimes i think about it a[nd]- and i got it because my husband used to travel and be out of he was out of country one time for three months
sw2490B-ms98-a-0075 440.473000 447.723000 and i was like uh you know we're in a nice neighborhood but still and you and then i've got it so far sometimes i think i i wonder if i
sw2490B-ms98-a-0076 447.723000 450.385000 i'm not about to load it because i [vocalized-noise]
sw2490B-ms98-a-0077 450.385000 465.316250 you know i assume that the kids are not going to ever get up there and it's in a case and it's you know it's put up and it's away and all that but i don't want to take the chance and i think if somebody ever does break in it's going to take me a year to find the shells and then get it [laughter] don't come in the
sw2490B-ms98-a-0078 465.316250 466.602875 hum

sw2490B-ms98-a-0080 479.568750 489.322625 i know i i used to think about th[at]- it was a lot easier when i was when i was when i was single it was one thing and when i was m[arried]- just married with no kids when it was just me
sw2490B-ms98-a-0081 489.322625 491.261750 it was an easy decision
sw2490B-ms98-a-0082 491.261750 504.411875 it was like you you come after me you're going to get it [laughter] [laughter-you] [laughter-know] and now there's so many other things where are the kids what are they doing you know where is this person coming in from uh you've got a[nd]- and i[f]- if you if you manage to get it out
sw2490B-ms98-a-0083 504.411875 513.902625 and then you know what h[ow]- how can you even afford to to think about what what you're going to do with it because_1 you don't know where your kids are at the same time ugh
sw2490B-ms98-a-0084 513.902625 520.576875 yeah we do too [laughter-yeah] i figure they'll make enough noise but

sw2490B-ms98-a-0087 534.608375 539.412250 yeah anything that the well any any advantage they can take
