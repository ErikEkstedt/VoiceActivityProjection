sw2452B-ms98-a-0053 230.768875 237.322000 didn't back down and uh and uh uh Saddam Hussein miscalculated all along
sw2452B-ms98-a-0054 237.322000 243.418875 thinking that it he wouldn't commit US lives and and forces and and monies
sw2452B-ms98-a-0055 243.418875 246.837750 to just to liberate a little country
sw2452B-ms98-a-0056 246.837750 248.780125 and uh
sw2452B-ms98-a-0057 248.780125 253.222875 and uh then then he u[nderestimated]- underestimated his ability to uh to uh
sw2452B-ms98-a-0058 253.222875 260.154500 wage a war with us i mean uh it's one thing when we all came over there and said okay here we are get out
sw2452B-ms98-a-0059 260.154500 264.759000 and he said no i'm i i can i can win a war with you guys
sw2452B-ms98-a-0060 264.759000 268.891750 and that and that was a a horrible miscalculation i mean
