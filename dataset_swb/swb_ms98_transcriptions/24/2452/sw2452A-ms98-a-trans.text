sw2452A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.658500 [noise]
sw2452A-ms98-a-0002 0.658500 3.219875 okay um
sw2452A-ms98-a-0003 3.219875 5.813000 [silence]
sw2452A-ms98-a-0004 5.813000 8.758000 the US involvement in [vocalized-noise]
sw2452A-ms98-a-0005 8.758000 11.389875 [noise] i guess even though
sw2452A-ms98-a-0006 11.389875 12.539375 [silence]
sw2452A-ms98-a-0007 12.539375 23.952500 well it is over but i don't think we're out of there by any means and uh and i wonder are we going to set up uh you know peace keeping type forces for long term and
sw2452A-ms98-a-0008 23.952500 27.291375 you know is that something we should do or shouldn't do i don't know
sw2452A-ms98-a-0009 27.291375 52.068625 [silence]
sw2452A-ms98-a-0010 52.068625 56.168000 i think that's true because i think they saw the support that came through
sw2452A-ms98-a-0011 56.168000 65.645750 the other thing that i think is good for like American businesses are to be involved is the the reports that i hear back and of course on the news i i try to
sw2452A-ms98-a-0012 65.645750 69.850125 listen and and also read between the lines [laughter-you] [laughter-know]
sw2452A-ms98-a-0013 69.850125 73.524750 but uh they said that because the Americans
sw2452A-ms98-a-0014 73.524750 87.208625 you know took such a proactive stance i[nvolvement]- involvement in the war that like so much of the buil[ding]- business and rebuilding Kuwait and things like that will go to American businesses where as before they may be dealt with Japanese firms or other people they said even though the Japanese
sw2452A-ms98-a-0015 87.208625 97.253500 were involved monetarily uh they fill like the first first priority ought to go to American businesses which i guess will be good you know which will be good for our economy
sw2452A-ms98-a-0016 97.253500 99.621875 but i you know when
sw2452A-ms98-a-0017 99.621875 100.870625 [silence]
sw2452A-ms98-a-0018 100.870625 106.424000 [laughter] boy don't you know i mean we don't seem to slow down even when there's a crisis [laughter]
sw2452A-ms98-a-0019 106.424000 107.339250 but i
sw2452A-ms98-a-0020 107.339250 109.782375 [silence]

sw2452A-ms98-a-0023 117.724125 125.834750 i imagine your oil companies they may see a probably the first big rise in business they've seen in years [laughter]

sw2452A-ms98-a-0027 133.495125 139.375500 [silence]
sw2452A-ms98-a-0028 139.375500 146.762250 yeah but look at their war that was his whole war is is i'm not satisfied with what Iraq has i want what everybody has
sw2452A-ms98-a-0029 146.762250 152.716375 and and you're right it's like y[ou]- y[ou]- you see two little pre school kids fighting over a toy you know [laughter]
sw2452A-ms98-a-0030 152.716375 162.655375 so i i'm a little concerned about you know i know they're putting President Bush right now in uh awkward position concerning the the
sw2452A-ms98-a-0031 162.655375 163.881875 [silence]
sw2452A-ms98-a-0032 163.881875 167.582750 the treaty over there right now you know what the what am i trying to say
sw2452A-ms98-a-0033 167.582750 173.071250 [silence]
sw2452A-ms98-a-0034 173.071250 176.084125 well supporting the Kurds but um
sw2452A-ms98-a-0035 176.084125 181.840250 you know where the the cease fire i'm [laughter-trying] [laughter-i] [laughter-forgot] [vocalized-noise] yeah you know because he
sw2452A-ms98-a-0036 181.840250 193.068000 he w[ants]- he wants them to uh uphold their end of the deal as far as the cease fire but at the same time he's not wanting to go in and say okay i'm gonna fight your war for you which which i think is is right
sw2452A-ms98-a-0037 193.068000 199.316750 you know if it's an internal thing i don't think we can walk in and say gee i think you're right you're wrong you know we're not the judge and jury
sw2452A-ms98-a-0038 199.316750 213.024375 uh but i know that that's causing him a little bit of unpopularity with the people over there because they feel like geez y[ou]- you told us to stand up against him but you're not helping and so i think he's in a pretty awkward position now and i i i think we ought to help
sw2452A-ms98-a-0039 213.024375 214.142750 you know
sw2452A-ms98-a-0040 214.142750 215.235125 [silence]
sw2452A-ms98-a-0041 215.235125 222.289125 yeah supply arms support them_1 if they need help but i don't think we ought to be over there fighting it for them_1 and and so i think he's done good on that stance
sw2452A-ms98-a-0042 222.289125 230.104500 [silence]
sw2452A-ms98-a-0043 230.104500 231.573875 yeah

sw2452A-ms98-a-0045 236.447000 238.206625 boy i would say
sw2452A-ms98-a-0046 238.206625 246.546375 [silence]
sw2452A-ms98-a-0047 246.546375 248.151375 that's right

sw2452A-ms98-a-0050 265.330000 268.418250 [silence]
sw2452A-ms98-a-0051 268.418250 279.876625 i agree you know they had advertised and and said news that he had the fifth largest army well he may have but you have t[o]- well not anymore but you have to have loyalty you have to have people who believe in your cause
sw2452A-ms98-a-0052 279.876625 294.179375 you know if i- i- i- i know they tried to turn it into a holy war because to them that is what's honorable you know to to if you die in in a holy cause but but i think they're smart enough see there was nothing holy about it we just wanted their land and took it you know [laughter] um
sw2452A-ms98-a-0053 294.179375 297.813500 [silence]
sw2452A-ms98-a-0054 297.813500 299.367125 sure
sw2452A-ms98-a-0055 299.367125 300.905625 [silence]
sw2452A-ms98-a-0056 300.905625 302.380875 sure
sw2452A-ms98-a-0057 302.380875 309.275000 [silence]
sw2452A-ms98-a-0058 309.275000 311.166250 uh
sw2452A-ms98-a-0059 311.166250 318.130375 [silence]
sw2452A-ms98-a-0060 318.130375 320.955750 well i hope that's true [laughter]
sw2452A-ms98-a-0061 320.955750 331.707375 i would think so i would think that you know i[t]- i guess in the back of my mind i think like maybe the I[sraeli]- Israeli Massad probably has ideas of going in and [laughter] you know basically i i thought they uh
sw2452A-ms98-a-0062 331.707375 342.172750 showed a a tremendous restraint in their reactions towards everything and but i don't believe for a minute that that means that they don't have ideas and plans of their [laughter-own]
sw2452A-ms98-a-0063 342.172750 354.806375 uh but i do agree with you i think President Bush handled it all politically very smart you know getting the support of of the other Arabs and other nations in the world and and i think that's how you have to go into something like that
sw2452A-ms98-a-0064 354.806375 384.775375 [silence]
sw2452A-ms98-a-0065 384.775375 386.795250 well and don't you feel

sw2452A-ms98-a-0067 388.159750 389.810000 that's right
sw2452A-ms98-a-0068 389.810000 397.768250 [silence]
sw2452A-ms98-a-0069 397.768250 406.440625 and don't you think that long term that's been a big boost for the United Nations i mean the United Nations has been there for years but all of a sudden uh
sw2452A-ms98-a-0070 406.440625 412.956000 yeah there're some teeth behind it and some fact that when they have sanctions and and we support things like this it means something
sw2452A-ms98-a-0071 412.956000 416.853000 and i think that's good for the strength of the United Nations
sw2452A-ms98-a-0072 416.853000 420.522625 [silence]
sw2452A-ms98-a-0073 420.522625 421.913875 yeah

sw2452A-ms98-a-0075 425.938875 428.204875 and rebuild from nothing

sw2452A-ms98-a-0077 429.361000 430.868000 yes

sw2452A-ms98-a-0081 436.321750 437.937375 that's true
sw2452A-ms98-a-0082 437.937375 450.400000 [silence]
sw2452A-ms98-a-0083 450.400000 452.694750 right they supported it
sw2452A-ms98-a-0084 452.694750 453.714625 [silence]
sw2452A-ms98-a-0085 453.714625 455.297375 um-hum
sw2452A-ms98-a-0086 455.297375 459.041625 [silence]
sw2452A-ms98-a-0087 459.041625 465.528500 that's right yeah they did ask that they build up uh Israel and Kuwait and i think they should have to
sw2452A-ms98-a-0088 465.528500 468.184500 they lost [laughter]
sw2452A-ms98-a-0089 468.184500 478.040375 [silence]
sw2452A-ms98-a-0090 478.040375 479.879375 well that's true
sw2452A-ms98-a-0091 479.879375 485.476000 [silence]
sw2452A-ms98-a-0092 485.476000 489.728000 well i don't think Iran's under the same type of madman type leadership
sw2452A-ms98-a-0093 489.728000 492.820000 but there's always the possibility i [laughter-guess]
sw2452A-ms98-a-0094 492.820000 497.924750 [silence]
sw2452A-ms98-a-0095 497.924750 499.362500 i think so
sw2452A-ms98-a-0096 499.362500 501.887125 [silence]
sw2452A-ms98-a-0097 501.887125 509.579625 i think i think the person who really maybe at this time has a hard road to tow is uh Jordan's King Hussein because he really
sw2452A-ms98-a-0098 509.579625 518.154375 kind of tried to straddle the fence you know he he wasn't necessarily for Iraq at the same time he didn't feel like everybody else ought to be going against Iraq
sw2452A-ms98-a-0099 518.154375 522.282625 [silence]
sw2452A-ms98-a-0100 522.282625 523.612375 yeah
sw2452A-ms98-a-0101 523.612375 527.345000 [silence]
sw2452A-ms98-a-0102 527.345000 528.671750 right
sw2452A-ms98-a-0103 528.671750 533.636375 [silence]
sw2452A-ms98-a-0104 533.636375 535.076125 none
sw2452A-ms98-a-0105 535.076125 547.355250 [silence]
sw2452A-ms98-a-0106 547.355250 556.819125 i know and isn't that amazing the way that they'll find their cause and a[nd]- and no matter what situation they see they're going to find their cause whether it's truly exists or not [laughter]
sw2452A-ms98-a-0107 556.819125 558.029375 yeah
sw2452A-ms98-a-0108 558.029375 564.595625 [silence]
sw2452A-ms98-a-0109 564.595625 566.108375 i know
sw2452A-ms98-a-0110 566.108375 578.470875 [silence]
sw2452A-ms98-a-0111 578.470875 580.156000 that's true
sw2452A-ms98-a-0112 580.156000 583.118125 [silence]
sw2452A-ms98-a-0113 583.118125 595.588000 but see you're also getting back to the the ages old problem of Arab Israel conflict as far as personalties and who's the selected one of God and i[t]- theirs ties in so much to their religion and
sw2452A-ms98-a-0114 595.588000 598.218125 so it's very different things than what we face
sw2452A-ms98-a-0115 598.218125 598.969000 [silence]
