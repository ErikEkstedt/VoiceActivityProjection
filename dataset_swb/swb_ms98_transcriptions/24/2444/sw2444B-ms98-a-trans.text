sw2444B-ms98-a-0020 120.994875 132.139500 uh went to get his uh sticker renewed and had a couple of little things like the clip that holds the uh oh the muffler pipes
sw2444B-ms98-a-0021 132.139500 139.109250 u[p]- up had broken or sheared or whatever and they measured the tread and i didn't know they did that to the tires

sw2444B-ms98-a-0031 207.975125 220.010375 that's that's a common feeling i- i- i empathize because um i well i'm real glad my husband knows something about cars but when i go in i feel really at a loss
sw2444B-ms98-a-0032 220.010375 232.789875 and and if we take my car in to be fixed he'll he'll tell them_1 what he wants and then he'll say well well call my wife if there's anything else that needs to be done [laughter] and then they call me at work because_1 he he doesn't work near uh uh uh doesn't
sw2444B-ms98-a-0033 232.789875 244.997750 have uh office yeah a phone and and so they'll call me and say well Mrs Parker we've got some good news and we've got some bad news the problem we thought about this morning is not a problem but the real problem is is uh
sw2444B-ms98-a-0034 244.997750 256.412875 and so the only way that i the only thing i know to do in in is if if it sounds plausible i'll say go ahead and do it but save me the parts or something so i can have him look at it 
sw2444B-ms98-a-0035 256.412875 261.211125 and that's the only thing that saved us is is his background there

sw2444B-ms98-a-0045 315.497625 323.080000 that's the t[ruth]- that's the truth i always wanted to know a little bit more but i think it was more to show off
sw2444B-ms98-a-0046 323.080000 333.889250 when i was growing up and i be[fore]- before i was married i was teaching school and teaching down in Corpus Christi and i wanted to be able to at least change a flat tire
sw2444B-ms98-a-0047 333.889250 347.202250 between Arlington where my family lived and down there and so i i ha[d]- one day i had s[aid]- told my brother i said now i know everybody's suppose to change tire know how but i said i can't do that will you help me will you show me
sw2444B-ms98-a-0048 347.202250 358.550625 and so i had him out there and he was helping and mother came to the door and said Larry you've got a phone call so he went in to talk to one of his many friends and i i'm i'm down i'm there with this tire off
sw2444B-ms98-a-0049 358.550625 369.140625 [laughter] so i thought i have better things to do i can do this myself and so oh i guess i was getting ready to start that was it it wasn't even off so i started
sw2444B-ms98-a-0050 369.140625 377.556000 jacking it up and and and so forth and somehow or other the the jack slipped it's one of those that has the ratchet kind of thing
sw2444B-ms98-a-0051 377.556000 385.178625 [laughter] and i reached out to grab it and it caught the the webbing between my thumb and my my forefinger
sw2444B-ms98-a-0052 385.178625 395.953250 it caught the and i couldn't do anything i fortunately it was loose it was no longer under the car and i i i could not get my my i could just see me through the rest of my life with this
sw2444B-ms98-a-0053 395.953250 404.323625 jack [laughter-attached] to my hand and i i couldn't see anybody on the street no other kids all over so i went to the to the door
sw2444B-ms98-a-0054 404.323625 417.585250 and it was summertime the air conditioner was on the door was closed and i couldn't knock because i had to hold the jack with the other [laughter-hand] i finally with my elbow rang the doorbell and mother came to the door
sw2444B-ms98-a-0055 417.585250 427.023000 and i wouldn't let her touch me [laughter-i] i wanted my brother to [laughter-help] me with this that was a sh[ock]- the he put the phone down pretty quickly and it didn't take him long to extricate
sw2444B-ms98-a-0056 427.023000 439.533375 my hand but oh i was scared to death i i i could see him cutting out m[y]- my whole palm just to get this little flap of [laughter-skin] [laughter-out] so that's that's how mechanical i am [laughter]
sw2444B-ms98-a-0057 439.533375 449.423250 and that was oh that was twenty five years ago so i i've not tried it since oh plus plus before this i had put all the lugs back in place
sw2444B-ms98-a-0058 449.423250 453.945375 but i had the wrong side out i didn't know there was a right and wrong side the thread worked
sw2444B-ms98-a-0059 453.945375 459.280125 and so i was so proud after he got me extricated he looked at went out there to check it over
sw2444B-ms98-a-0060 459.280125 464.451750 and he just laughed he said Sissy i'm sorry [laughter] but we're going to redo this
