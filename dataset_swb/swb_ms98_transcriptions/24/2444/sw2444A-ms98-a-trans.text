sw2444A-ms98-a-0010 21.598250 28.282500 um well i- i- i guess the last thing that we had done uh
sw2444A-ms98-a-0011 28.282500 38.676125 was prob[ably]- we had to have new tires put on it and uh it's sort of a long story we had to get our car inspected uh for the state inspection sticker and
sw2444A-ms98-a-0012 38.676125 53.097625 uh the the gas station i didn't know this but the gas station if they reject your car uh they put an x on your inspection sticker and and uh you have to go back to that same station to get it inspected
sw2444A-ms98-a-0013 53.097625 60.948250 you can't go to a different one and they didn't pass our ti[res]- our tires on uh on my car
sw2444A-ms98-a-0014 60.948250 73.910500 so uh what they didn't pass the uh the back tires the two back tires so what i did i went down and bought two new uh tires had them put on the front and then my front tires were just rotated to the back
sw2444A-ms98-a-0015 73.910500 80.987125 and uh so i went back to the gas station and uh the guy said well your back tires still don't pass
sw2444A-ms98-a-0016 80.987125 88.525125 and i said no you've got to be kidding because_1 i i just moved them_1 and i told him what i did and he got his little gauge out and said well these don't pass
sw2444A-ms98-a-0017 88.525125 96.769750 so then i had to go back and buy two more oh Lord i was so frustrated with that but uh
sw2444A-ms98-a-0018 96.769750 104.909250 besides routine oil changes i guess that was about the uh the last last major thing that we've had done to the car

sw2444A-ms98-a-0030 155.923750 164.847375 you know the guy is pretty lenient on the inspection stickers so uh he's definitely going to get my business i tell you but uh
