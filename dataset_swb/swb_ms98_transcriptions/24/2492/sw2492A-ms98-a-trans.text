sw2492A-ms98-a-0033 133.132125 144.278375 my husband basically does most of it and he does the you know edging and all that kind of thing and we're renting and so we don't really put a lot of money into the
sw2492A-ms98-a-0034 144.278375 156.779875 uh you know th[is]- like this lawn could probably stand a couple of loads of dirt and some Saint Augustine we just we have winter rye out back and we have i don't even know what it [laughter-is] out front
sw2492A-ms98-a-0035 156.779875 163.657125 but um we this is the first house we've ever lived in and we're just not real into the lawn probably because_1 we rent i guess huh

sw2492A-ms98-a-0048 200.040000 207.977500 really well i'll have to remember that because_1 uh hopefully we won't have them_1 this year but we have a cat that comes in and out
sw2492A-ms98-a-0049 207.977500 221.366625 and the cat was getting um fleas and stuff and bringing them_1 in the house so we had a real problem last year with fleas and it was uh quite a drag because um we got them_1 in our house and
sw2492A-ms98-a-0050 221.366625 233.706875 [laughter] we're Christians and we prayed that we could get rid of these fleas and we got rid of them_1 believe it or not with smoke bombs which is just about impossible to do but we did and so we don't want them_1 back this year you [laughter-know]
sw2492A-ms98-a-0051 233.706875 237.828250 so i'll remember that if we see it's a problem in the yard we almost
sw2492A-ms98-a-0052 237.828250 247.496500 they were so bad last year even ticks it i don't know we've had ticks before a lot and we've had to get out and treat our lawn for that i think we used Dursban
sw2492A-ms98-a-0053 247.496500 253.216375 [vocalized-noise] we used Dursban and Diazinon and get out there and do what you do [laughter]
sw2492A-ms98-a-0054 253.216375 259.859625 with that thing you know and spread it all out everywhere but that's about the extent of our lawn care
sw2492A-ms98-a-0055 259.859625 263.002500 so i don't know do you enjoy doing it

sw2492A-ms98-a-0060 291.668750 305.642500 you know i'm kind of like you and he's kind of like your wife and you know in that he doesn't really enjoy it but i would like to have a garden though that's my thing but right now where we're living we have the trees where the uh roots are at the top of the ground everywhere all over the ground
sw2492A-ms98-a-0061 305.642500 312.032875 i don't know what kind of trees they are but you can't have a gar[den]- you can't till it or it'll it'll tear up a nice tiller
sw2492A-ms98-a-0062 312.032875 323.322500 so we're going to wait until we move we don't have a lot of sun either because_1 it big trees back there so we're going to wait and when we move that's one of our priorities is to get a house where we can have a um garden
sw2492A-ms98-a-0063 323.322500 327.987375 and so i'd like to do that i have a feeling i'll be out there all the time [laughter]
