sw2491A-ms98-a-0046 228.667625 235.884875 well it's a little bit surprising because uh the older we get my husband retired a little over a year ago and
sw2491A-ms98-a-0047 235.884875 245.048000 we still of course are maintaining our home and he keeps up the painting and and all of this and we did remodel we have a large uh
sw2491A-ms98-a-0048 245.048000 251.534250 den i suppose it is kitchen den combination [vocalized-noise] and we did remodel that after
sw2491A-ms98-a-0049 251.534250 262.770750 after uh he retired but as far as doing anything uh major to it we at this point would rather travel and i uh

sw2491A-ms98-a-0064 292.002375 299.157000 somehow we don't think of a gift as being quite as dear to us as something that we've had to work for i mean

sw2491A-ms98-a-0066 300.491750 311.730875 we i- i i look at our home though and i think well gosh you know if we don't do this then the next person who owns this home for instance is going to probably remodel the kitchen put in new cabi[nets]-
sw2491A-ms98-a-0067 311.730875 323.504625 it's that kind of thing you know after oh twenty six years uh things get a little scuffed up and it's not something that i'm not interested in the mess anymore
sw2491A-ms98-a-0068 323.504625 326.496250 uh the style of our neighborhood uh
sw2491A-ms98-a-0069 326.496250 335.367375 we're certainly not the smallest home and we're not the largest home but it has maintained itself in that the homes that were built afterwards
sw2491A-ms98-a-0070 335.367375 337.355000 uh have come up
sw2491A-ms98-a-0071 337.355000 343.295750 some of them are a little smaller because at one point they wanted to put some two thirty five housing in

sw2491A-ms98-a-0073 345.133750 346.763250 well
sw2491A-ms98-a-0074 346.763250 357.252750 i[t]- it i[t's]- it's a law it was quite some time ago when the neighborhood was very new and we had some v[ery]- very restrictive covenants uh in the subdivision
sw2491A-ms98-a-0075 357.252750 364.804875 and they were attempting to put seven houses in an area that was originally set aside for five
sw2491A-ms98-a-0076 364.804875 373.571375 and i think the two thirty five came because they could people could get into them_1 for a down payment of something like two hundred and thirty five dollars
sw2491A-ms98-a-0077 373.571375 387.686750 and of course we were involved with an attorney and were able to stop that before it got off the ground and so the some of the homes on that side of the street are a little bit smaller but they were

sw2491A-ms98-a-0098 451.946500 466.466375 no we do not have a basement because we would had to have built up instead of down because uh there's the rock is so close to the surface here that it's difficult to to do basements so we didn't do that but um
sw2491A-ms98-a-0099 466.466375 469.374000 we have an attached two car garage and
