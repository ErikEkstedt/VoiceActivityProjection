sw2491B-ms98-a-0004 29.007000 33.880875 [noise] oh that's pretty nice i did mine i built my own home in nineteen sixty one
sw2491B-ms98-a-0005 33.880875 40.371875 that's pretty much about the same time and uh i- i built on two acres of land in a town called Cumberland Rhode Island
sw2491B-ms98-a-0006 40.371875 47.367750 and it was it's uh it's just a private uh piece of property i mean there's no you know there's no other
sw2491B-ms98-a-0007 47.367750 53.101500 well there's other houses in the area but at that time there were just individual homes scattered throughout
sw2491B-ms98-a-0008 53.101500 54.630750 uh the town
sw2491B-ms98-a-0009 54.630750 58.652875 and i guess the town of Cumberland's probably got thirty five thousand people in it or so
sw2491B-ms98-a-0010 58.652875 67.000000 which is right on on the Massachusetts Rhode Island state line that's that's why i work in Massachusetts it's only it's only a twenty minute ride
sw2491B-ms98-a-0011 67.000000 68.518750 and uh
sw2491B-ms98-a-0012 68.518750 80.598375 i did the whole house myself as a matter of fact i had the foundation [vocalized-noise] poured the concrete poured and the rest of all the building i did entirely on my own which was quite a project uh i [laughter-don't]
sw2491B-ms98-a-0013 80.598375 84.158125 no [noise] no i- i- i don't think so

sw2491B-ms98-a-0015 86.640000 92.912750 uh i- i would i would probably i would act as a contractor and subcontract everything out i think
sw2491B-ms98-a-0016 92.912750 107.349000 i but i would not physically do the work because i worked every night after after working all day in the in the plant and then weekends all your weekends were tied up and it took me about oh a little over seven months to finish it which i thought was pretty good
sw2491B-ms98-a-0017 107.349000 110.906250 yes i- i completely finished the house
sw2491B-ms98-a-0018 110.906250 114.595375 [silence]

sw2491B-ms98-a-0025 128.220000 138.315625 [noise] i had uh when i moved in i did not have my garage built and my breezeway and the concrete s[tairs]- upstairs the stairs were
sw2491B-ms98-a-0026 138.315625 141.931125 were made out of wood and the reason i did that it was getting
sw2491B-ms98-a-0027 141.931125 144.702375 late in November and the winter was coming
sw2491B-ms98-a-0028 144.702375 158.354875 and i just i ran out of time really and i- i waited until the house was completely finished in the interior and the e[xterior]- exterior of the house short of the breezeway and the and the attached garage
sw2491B-ms98-a-0029 158.354875 168.838125 and i did that and the driveway the following spring which uh i needed a break from the work and i- and i needed a break to get a little more money ahead stuff like that so i waited
sw2491B-ms98-a-0030 168.838125 180.000750 oh probably November December until March or April i guess around April and then i went ahead and built the breezeway and the garage because_1 i thought it was too cold to be pouring concrete outside in the winter time

sw2491B-ms98-a-0036 199.000375 202.674125 real proud of their homes and they've managed to take care of them
sw2491B-ms98-a-0037 202.674125 204.907500 but i noticed
sw2491B-ms98-a-0038 204.907500 206.431500 now
sw2491B-ms98-a-0039 206.431500 208.178625 that
sw2491B-ms98-a-0040 208.178625 213.156875 several of the homes where the elderly folks that live there
sw2491B-ms98-a-0041 213.156875 217.647000 have either gone on or or moved or whatever
sw2491B-ms98-a-0042 217.647000 221.520500 and their children are now living there okay
sw2491B-ms98-a-0043 221.520500 229.638125 and they -[ju]st don't team seem to tend as much to them as their parents did does that make sense

sw2491B-ms98-a-0049 261.085875 272.044125 i've done the s[ame]- i did the same thing but i'm what i'm saying is that some of the people that i know they have moved on to Florida or retired you know similar to your [vocalized-noise] your uh situation 
sw2491B-ms98-a-0050 272.044125 286.225250 but their homes have passed on to their [vocalized-noise] their children or or to younger younger families and they don't seem to maintain it as well as the original people did uh i or or like you would or i would and perhaps its just because it's
sw2491B-ms98-a-0051 286.225250 292.655375 you know some of them homes were given to them and some of them the young people had to buy and perhaps they don't have the money to spend on them
