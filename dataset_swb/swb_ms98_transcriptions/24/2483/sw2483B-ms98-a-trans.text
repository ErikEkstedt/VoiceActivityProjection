sw2483B-ms98-a-0002 1.415500 2.795125 no i'm not
sw2483B-ms98-a-0003 2.795125 9.750000 [silence]
sw2483B-ms98-a-0004 9.750000 17.643750 and i think a great number of students who got word of it and participators in general and voice who heard about the program
sw2483B-ms98-a-0005 17.643750 29.062750 [silence]
sw2483B-ms98-a-0006 29.062750 31.642500 i rely primarily on
sw2483B-ms98-a-0007 31.642500 35.120375 on newspaper combined with television
sw2483B-ms98-a-0008 35.120375 57.186000 [silence]
sw2483B-ms98-a-0009 57.186000 58.709125 uh
sw2483B-ms98-a-0010 58.709125 60.529500 [silence]
sw2483B-ms98-a-0011 60.529500 61.993000 okay
sw2483B-ms98-a-0012 61.993000 93.835000 [silence]
sw2483B-ms98-a-0013 93.835000 95.922000 that's rather interesting
sw2483B-ms98-a-0014 95.922000 107.909750 [silence]
sw2483B-ms98-a-0015 107.909750 109.556250 [laughter]
sw2483B-ms98-a-0016 109.556250 118.934500 [silence]
sw2483B-ms98-a-0017 118.934500 121.729750 i'd i'd have to say i haven't either
sw2483B-ms98-a-0018 121.729750 154.419625 [silence]
sw2483B-ms98-a-0019 154.419625 167.218000 i listen to the radio f[ive]- uh probably g[et]- five or six hours a week but almost inevitably to a station that is a classical uh station here that based on research primal for music purposes
sw2483B-ms98-a-0020 167.218000 174.148375 we don't use the radio as a wake up we have our a uh television connected to a uh
sw2483B-ms98-a-0021 174.148375 185.133125 uh electronic alarm uh system that kicks in and it comes on with CNN in the morning so we we wake up to television news and uh
sw2483B-ms98-a-0022 185.133125 192.436750 uh shower and dress and whatever to that and then because of the fact that my wife and i ride to work together uh in a car
sw2483B-ms98-a-0023 192.436750 196.867375 we we chat at each other rather than than something else
sw2483B-ms98-a-0024 196.867375 204.259250 uh and occasionally what we'll each do depending on who's driving is have the newspaper sort of on our lap on the way in in the car so
sw2483B-ms98-a-0025 204.259250 212.983375 we have the advantage of being able to uh read and drive although there seems to be from what i've seen on the freeway recently that a fair number of people are reading and driving [laughter]
sw2483B-ms98-a-0026 212.983375 216.632500 [silence]
sw2483B-ms98-a-0027 216.632500 224.091500 [laughter] so we we rely pretty pretty heavily i think on a combination of the of the two i also uh use
sw2483B-ms98-a-0028 224.091500 236.064500 uh Newsweek magazine uh we tend to alternate between Newsweek and Time and whatever happens to be the the uh news magazine of the year for us and uh i read
sw2483B-ms98-a-0029 236.064500 240.845250 sporadically of commentary and a couple of other
sw2483B-ms98-a-0030 240.845250 246.897875 you know trade magazines and uh uh such as that uh where i i might read
sw2483B-ms98-a-0031 246.897875 256.553875 the there there're occasional social and even current event commentaries and and everything as diverse as ACM to uh uh some of the the other tabloids i get so
sw2483B-ms98-a-0032 256.553875 263.873250 uh i guess i use eighty percent written is probably my input and and twenty percent uh television i
sw2483B-ms98-a-0033 263.873250 275.502750 i think i respect the from a journalistic perspective current events i've always said that it it's really not interesting unless it's three weeks old and and found its way into a a news weekly headline
sw2483B-ms98-a-0034 275.502750 285.858625 uh other than that it was a [vocalized-noise] at best uh we're probably not thrilled with our only newspaper that we have in Raleigh there there are other uh
sw2483B-ms98-a-0035 285.858625 300.800000 i'm not sure what you would call them they com[peting]- the the small uh competing independent sort of newspapers little small weekly things but there's only one daily uh it's called the News and Observer fondly referred to here by some as the uh uh
sw2483B-ms98-a-0036 300.800000 308.717375 sometimes the noise and observer uh it depends it it's it has decent national coverage but has an extremely
sw2483B-ms98-a-0037 308.717375 322.737500 focused political coverage probably steeped in the southern history and the fact that that this is a Democratic State and uh consequently everything is filtered through that Repu[blic]- uh Republican Democratic sort of
sw2483B-ms98-a-0038 322.737500 327.229750 glass uh almost unnecessarily f[or]- so uh
sw2483B-ms98-a-0039 327.229750 335.086250 [silence]
sw2483B-ms98-a-0040 335.086250 346.838625 yeah we we have that is uh as a matter of fact they update it once a week with a special section and and we pay it sort of glancing nod we uh have a very good friend who is
sw2483B-ms98-a-0041 346.838625 353.821000 uh tapped into the city planning structure uh a developer architect friend and
sw2483B-ms98-a-0042 353.821000 368.522375 right so i think we find out what's happening in the city uh on a fairly frequent basis over a over a gin and tonic sort of thing uh and that probably gives us a better insight as to the city of Raleigh than than the paper would have anyway
sw2483B-ms98-a-0043 368.522375 395.881750 [silence]

sw2483B-ms98-a-0048 409.513875 414.739250 is that right i i heard that there was some stuff on the on the radio that was equivalent to CNN
sw2483B-ms98-a-0049 414.739250 416.122500 [silence]
sw2483B-ms98-a-0050 416.122500 417.433500 okay

sw2483B-ms98-a-0057 446.618250 450.395375 [silence]
sw2483B-ms98-a-0058 450.395375 451.675250 um-hum
sw2483B-ms98-a-0059 451.675250 471.703500 [silence]
sw2483B-ms98-a-0060 471.703500 479.813375 um we probably were listening to CNN fairly heavily before the war broadcast began
sw2483B-ms98-a-0061 479.813375 486.716125 uh we almost lived and and breathed it for because during the war itself to the point where we began to
sw2483B-ms98-a-0062 486.716125 491.022875 sort of have household pact of let's turn the war off and and get something done
sw2483B-ms98-a-0063 491.022875 503.689750 uh almost an addiction uh and and we could equate or relate well to some of the newspaper and television articles about the fact that people where having this problem in in unhooking uncoupling from the events
sw2483B-ms98-a-0064 503.689750 510.308250 and going on with their lives uh instead of being watching the missiles and being glued to the to the tube and whatever
sw2483B-ms98-a-0065 510.308250 520.263000 uh and because of that we began towards the middle o[f]- end of the war i guess about two and a half three weeks in we began to restrict our news almost deliberately where we would
sw2483B-ms98-a-0066 520.263000 528.690250 uh watch uh fifteen minutes before fifteen minutes after six our time which would be national news or our local news
sw2483B-ms98-a-0067 528.690250 541.402125 we would watch CNN until six thirty then we would watch uh a rotating network news of either uh ABC CBS or NBC and we we sort of just rotated around the dial each night a different one
sw2483B-ms98-a-0068 541.402125 552.279375 and we would watch the first fifteen minutes and then turn the television off and and we were sort of uh limiting or dieting ourself on on news that way and then we would do a similar thing
sw2483B-ms98-a-0069 552.279375 562.165375 uh at uh ten forty five because uh CNN would be wrapping their hourly coverage up and then we would get the local coverage uh
sw2483B-ms98-a-0070 562.165375 575.298000 and then i think the local coverage we would tend to watch the same station that would would have better state coverage rather than local coverage uh three of the networks here on their local news uh that
sw2483B-ms98-a-0071 575.298000 585.209000 i[f]- if you wish to listen at eleven o'clock you can find out who raped who murdered who or stole what from whom and that was the sort of thing that i would say is the best in [vocalized-noise] and not news
sw2483B-ms98-a-0072 585.209000 595.660625 unless it's there's some trend or or something that says gee this this neighborhood has been hit forty seven times or whatever uh that's that's sort of more of a of a pattern news
