sw2483A-ms98-a-0004 29.444500 34.282625 [silence]
sw2483A-ms98-a-0005 34.282625 38.737125 huh uh y[ou're]- you're the opposite of me i drive
sw2483A-ms98-a-0006 38.737125 50.152375 an hour each way to work and so if i just use time and not in say one which quality is the best i g[uess]- that would be two hours roughly of talk shows and news on radio
sw2483A-ms98-a-0007 50.152375 61.342750 and then newspapers and TV would be tied after that because uh maybe i'll catch the the evening news like ten o'clock on TV and i [vocalized-noise] so that's a half an hour roughly the same with newspaper
sw2483A-ms98-a-0008 61.342750 69.685125 i really of course you would of you're in a different part of the country i i really listen to a lot of the talk shows i don't mean the gossip ones but there's a lot of

sw2483A-ms98-a-0051 355.152625 361.858375 [silence]
sw2483A-ms98-a-0052 361.858375 363.973500 yeah you're right
sw2483A-ms98-a-0053 363.973500 368.538000 [silence]
sw2483A-ms98-a-0054 368.538000 382.967000 my wife i you know it mentioned the the question was uh do you get it from people too and i i can say the same thing you do that uh my wife is uh she reads the paper from front to back and so she'll tell me some stuff and she'll always get mad and she'll say you didn't read the uh
sw2483A-ms98-a-0055 382.967000 386.607500 well i always read the sports uh what am i thinking of the
sw2483A-ms98-a-0056 386.607500 389.592875 the commentaries i can't even think of what it is offhand
sw2483A-ms98-a-0057 389.592875 398.092250 she's always reading something and she says why haven't you read that and i say i never have time to read it like you do but which i always get a lot of my information from the newspaper through her
sw2483A-ms98-a-0058 398.092250 412.190625 uh so i guess we do get it from people too oh you mentioned [CNNN/CNN] of course i r[adio]- mentioned radio and the CNN TV news you know it's the same thing that's on the radio word for word yeah i[t]-
sw2483A-ms98-a-0059 412.190625 414.632750 [silence]
sw2483A-ms98-a-0060 414.632750 420.781625 y[eah]- well it is CNN exactly uh because_1 uh and it because uh
sw2483A-ms98-a-0061 420.781625 425.491125 we have it here at work a matter of fact at TI they have it in the break area CNN
sw2483A-ms98-a-0062 425.491125 435.832375 and but the reason i say that because on the radio they'll say and look at this you know and then when i first heard CNN it only started about uh since the war you know or right before that
sw2483A-ms98-a-0063 435.832375 445.966750 and then they would always say and look at this and there'd be pause you know and and you'd hear music and stuff and i realized it's the exact commentary that's you have on on the news yeah
sw2483A-ms98-a-0064 445.966750 457.059125 but it's still good it's still uh uh you know it's you don't really miss anything but i d[o]- i do enjoy uh since the the Gulf War uh listen to CNN radio too
sw2483A-ms98-a-0065 457.059125 467.056375 as well as watching CNN and uh TV here at work i don't have CNN at home me turn this mic[rophone]- radio off i'm i'm actually at work right now believe it or not [noise]
