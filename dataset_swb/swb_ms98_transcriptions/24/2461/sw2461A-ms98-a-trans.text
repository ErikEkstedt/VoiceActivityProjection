sw2461A-ms98-a-0006 27.131875 37.500375 uh when i was in college i l[ike]- i enjoyed teaching because_1 i did some teaching part-time and i really enjoyed that but i wouldn't wanna go teach high school or junior high it just you know too many problems
sw2461A-ms98-a-0007 37.500375 41.253625 [silence]
sw2461A-ms98-a-0008 41.253625 50.702250 yeah they're putting in fifty sixty hours a week i'm sure because_1 they got to grade papers and get class stuff ready and you know and they're being paid probably half what most people being paid

sw2461A-ms98-a-0017 109.626250 113.356250 because_1 uh i guess we don't trust the school systems which is really sad
sw2461A-ms98-a-0018 113.356250 117.846500 um but [vocalized-noise] but it if it doesn't start at home it's not gonna go anywhere
sw2461A-ms98-a-0019 117.846500 121.360625 uh and we're gonna try to teach him good values because_1
sw2461A-ms98-a-0020 121.360625 133.863750 you know wh[en]- when when when they get to upper level school and they start teaching well hey if you can play football or basketball that's what's important not if you can read or write or do or u[nderstand]- understand some science you know i mean give me a break that's that's that's bogus
sw2461A-ms98-a-0021 133.863750 140.312750 [silence]
sw2461A-ms98-a-0022 140.312750 142.128125 yeah
sw2461A-ms98-a-0023 142.128125 153.551125 [silence]
sw2461A-ms98-a-0024 153.551125 160.470500 and Dallas uh school district just recently got an advised status because_1 of their low quality schooling i couldn't believe that
sw2461A-ms98-a-0025 160.470500 168.209625 [silence]
sw2461A-ms98-a-0026 168.209625 169.736250 yes
sw2461A-ms98-a-0027 169.736250 177.528125 [silence]
sw2461A-ms98-a-0028 177.528125 185.161000 yeah we talked you talked about before about the the school funding i think there's only gonna be one solution to school funding which i- i don't think will be necessarily
sw2461A-ms98-a-0029 185.161000 196.960000 the best way but i think wh[at's]- what's gonna have to happen is there's gonna have to be tuition for grade school and junior high and high school kids that's the only way they're gonna fund it because_1 they start raising taxes for property and people are gonna throw a fit
sw2461A-ms98-a-0030 196.960000 201.132750 [silence]
sw2461A-ms98-a-0031 201.132750 202.809750 oh yeah
sw2461A-ms98-a-0032 202.809750 204.021375 [silence]
sw2461A-ms98-a-0033 204.021375 208.143875 yeah and the only thing they they wou[ld]- would think of would be tuition
sw2461A-ms98-a-0034 208.143875 216.527500 you know if it works at colleges it'll work down below and you know that's gonna that's gonna affect the people that are having kids in school of course which is probably the only fair thing to do
sw2461A-ms98-a-0035 216.527500 221.530125 but it'll be hard for those that people ha[ve]- ha[ve]- have in school because_1 they have to pay out even more
sw2461A-ms98-a-0036 221.530125 226.529000 [silence]
sw2461A-ms98-a-0037 226.529000 228.082625 oh yeah

sw2461A-ms98-a-0041 240.102250 245.019250 i can't believe that i mean when i was in junior high and high school that never happened you never heard about that
sw2461A-ms98-a-0042 245.019250 246.460500 [silence]
sw2461A-ms98-a-0043 246.460500 255.164125 no and now you know what we have now you know got kids that Rusty because_1 he like you know a a a Magnum gun in school like good grief
sw2461A-ms98-a-0044 255.164125 263.879625 i mean i wou[ld]- i'd be afraid to be in school i mean b[e]- teaching or even a being a student and think what's what's it gonna be like for my my youngest and my oldest son when he goes to school
sw2461A-ms98-a-0045 263.879625 269.054250 wh[at]- what's gonna happen i mean i i'm afraid for him to go but on the other hand you can't hold them_1 back
sw2461A-ms98-a-0046 269.054250 281.917000 [silence]
sw2461A-ms98-a-0047 281.917000 290.301125 yeah a lot tougher from it was when i was going to school and that was when i was i graduated high school in nineteen seventy nine so that was what twelve years ago i guess
sw2461A-ms98-a-0048 290.301125 296.174375 so you know it's a lot different now and what's it gonna be like in another twelve years when my uh oldest son's in high school
sw2461A-ms98-a-0049 296.174375 298.701125 i'm afraid to i'm afraid to even think about it

sw2461A-ms98-a-0053 311.877375 324.697250 that's all you can do you got to you got to be your child's best friend i guess even when they're a teenager and they you know are kind of standoffish still you got to be their best friend because_1 when they got problems who they gonna go to their friends that are dealing drugs or or there parents
sw2461A-ms98-a-0054 324.697250 328.711375 you know and and if they go to their friends dealing drugs they're gonna be in even worse shape
sw2461A-ms98-a-0055 328.711375 332.099250 and and the schools don't don't really encourage
sw2461A-ms98-a-0056 332.099250 346.805500 to stay away from that you know the schools are there teach history and that we fought the civil war etcetera etcetera they don't teach them_1 good values like drugs are bad i don't maybe i'm wrong may[be]- because_1 i haven't you know been in that kind of environment for a long time but it just is amazing you know need to teach them_1 good values
