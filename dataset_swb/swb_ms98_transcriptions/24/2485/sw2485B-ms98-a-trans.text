sw2485B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.761250 [noise]
sw2485B-ms98-a-0002 0.761250 2.147250 okay
sw2485B-ms98-a-0003 2.147250 4.929125 [silence]
sw2485B-ms98-a-0004 4.929125 17.972625 yes and uh let me tell you this is really neat thing to do too that they did i didn't do it some of the other people the older people organized it and what they did was they had uh a book made up
sw2485B-ms98-a-0005 17.972625 22.464500 and it was like when our ancestors first came over
sw2485B-ms98-a-0006 22.464500 27.348750 and then what they did was they asked every family to write something about their family
sw2485B-ms98-a-0007 27.348750 31.451250 and like how many kids you had and who you had married and
sw2485B-ms98-a-0008 31.451250 44.677375 you know it went through like and it showed who my uh well who my husband's parents were you know and who he married and then how many children we had and then like his brothers and sisters and it went through the whole family and stuff
sw2485B-ms98-a-0009 44.677375 46.986750 and it was so good
sw2485B-ms98-a-0010 46.986750 48.021375 [silence]
sw2485B-ms98-a-0011 48.021375 54.558000 yeah but it it really did you know and p[lus]- plus it got a lot more people interested in it because you got to participate sort of
sw2485B-ms98-a-0012 54.558000 57.780375 [silence]
sw2485B-ms98-a-0013 57.780375 60.277500 right um-hum
sw2485B-ms98-a-0014 60.277500 70.325375 right and everybody got a book that came to the reunion and it told like uh you know where the first Connally's came over and um
sw2485B-ms98-a-0015 70.325375 76.660625 it told what happened when they got there and how many kids they had and it just kept coming on up through the generations
sw2485B-ms98-a-0016 76.660625 80.862875 so it was really that was really neat and
sw2485B-ms98-a-0017 80.862875 90.379750 well he does [laughter] he does i don't but uh he has enough relatives to make up for me not having any [laughter]
sw2485B-ms98-a-0018 90.379750 94.910000 [silence]
sw2485B-ms98-a-0019 94.910000 96.297125 uh-huh
sw2485B-ms98-a-0020 96.297125 101.200125 [silence]
sw2485B-ms98-a-0021 101.200125 114.245875 yeah that's what that's what happened when i when i first uh met my husband i said this can't be you know nobody can have this many relatives because_1 a lot of them_1 lived in like a group you know down one highway
sw2485B-ms98-a-0022 114.245875 117.911875 and there was a lake and they all lived down there by it
sw2485B-ms98-a-0023 117.911875 125.093250 and so we were going down the highway you know and he kept saying this is where my uncle and this is where my aunt lives and my uncle you know and we and i kept thinking
sw2485B-ms98-a-0024 125.093250 135.700750 this guy is putting me on nobody has this many [laughter-relatives] you know [laughter] so but they really were all there and another thing that's real good about um
sw2485B-ms98-a-0025 135.700750 145.802125 family reunion is having everybody just cook whatever is their specialty and bring it at because nobody it seemed like liked the same thing
sw2485B-ms98-a-0026 145.802125 157.866500 but you had a choice and then you got to taste a lot of new dishes and stuff too and got get a lot of good recipes where if you set a certain thing and say okay we're g[oing]- all going to have fried fish or we're all going to have fried chicken
sw2485B-ms98-a-0027 157.866500 160.175500 everybody might not like that
sw2485B-ms98-a-0028 160.175500 163.388500 [silence]
sw2485B-ms98-a-0029 163.388500 166.128250 oh yeah yeah they came from all over
sw2485B-ms98-a-0030 166.128250 168.936625 [silence]
sw2485B-ms98-a-0031 168.936625 183.443500 um they just stayed with different ones of them_1 they just came down and like say okay this aunt and uncle Kip uh all their kids and their grand kids and everything and then they had it it it gotten so big that they had it at the church
sw2485B-ms98-a-0032 183.443500 187.399375 and they had a church service ahead of it you know and then they had uh
sw2485B-ms98-a-0033 187.399375 189.970625 then they ate out on the ground
sw2485B-ms98-a-0034 189.970625 192.030000 um-hum [noise] um-hum
sw2485B-ms98-a-0035 192.030000 193.618875 [silence]
sw2485B-ms98-a-0036 193.618875 195.530500 yeah um-hum
sw2485B-ms98-a-0037 195.530500 221.645625 [silence]
sw2485B-ms98-a-0038 221.645625 233.348125 but you know what you can do at a lot of these lakes and things if you could find a centrally located like uh say it's about the same distance for all of y'all to come they have these places where you can rent them_1
sw2485B-ms98-a-0039 233.348125 246.274750 and it you know like on a lake and it's like uh it's a big place i mean you know it got and it got little rooms that separate off of it and stuff and it's not very expensive that a way
sw2485B-ms98-a-0040 246.274750 259.672250 right it's like a they have like a a convention type thing and then it has little rooms off of it where you know you'd go and sleep at night time but then it has like a kitchenette and things like that but y[ou]-
sw2485B-ms98-a-0041 259.672250 262.110000 [silence]
sw2485B-ms98-a-0042 262.110000 264.617250 right
sw2485B-ms98-a-0043 264.617250 266.401250 and ano[ther]-
sw2485B-ms98-a-0044 266.401250 272.036000 [silence]
sw2485B-ms98-a-0045 272.036000 275.124625 yeah but they had that was you know that
sw2485B-ms98-a-0046 275.124625 285.592250 what you can do is you can uh write different places the Chamber of Commerce and tell them_1 what you're interested in and ask them what they have you know at area lakes and all
sw2485B-ms98-a-0047 285.592250 297.517250 if they have something like that because now every time we plan anything just about we write to the Chamber of Commerce of where we're going because you can find out so much easier that a way than try to locate it you know
sw2485B-ms98-a-0048 297.517250 310.253125 calling different places can real[ly]- really run you up a bill but uh if you can find a centrally located place where everybody would have to come about the same distance i mean you can't get it exact you know usually
sw2485B-ms98-a-0049 310.253125 315.067750 but uh and then everybody goes that place and me it's not bad at all
sw2485B-ms98-a-0050 315.067750 326.072000 but they have lot of times they'll have like uh little cabins and three or four or five families can stay in those cabins because_1 they have you know just the single bunk beds and stuff
sw2485B-ms98-a-0051 326.072000 334.512000 and they can all stay in those cabins and then you know you can have cookouts and stuff like that that doesn't cost you as much
sw2485B-ms98-a-0052 334.512000 336.120000 [silence]
sw2485B-ms98-a-0053 336.120000 344.194000 yeah but that's uh you know that's the best way i found because whenever you have something where you go and now we had one
sw2485B-ms98-a-0054 344.194000 354.449000 this was before i lost a lot more of my family but it wasn't any of my immediate family anyway because_1 i didn't have any of them left but um they had uh uh
sw2485B-ms98-a-0055 354.449000 355.583375 [silence]
sw2485B-ms98-a-0056 355.583375 359.374125 thing where you could everybody could come and meet and go out to eat
sw2485B-ms98-a-0057 359.374125 371.002000 but i didn't think that was as good because it was like you know you couldn't really talk and stuff like you could when you was at the lake or somewhere you know where you were out this was like everybody came into town and went to this restaurant
sw2485B-ms98-a-0058 371.002000 372.199500 [silence]
sw2485B-ms98-a-0059 372.199500 375.511000 yeah and it just i didn't like that one as well
sw2485B-ms98-a-0060 375.511000 383.705500 [silence]
sw2485B-ms98-a-0061 383.705500 385.013625 no
sw2485B-ms98-a-0062 385.013625 386.044750 [silence]
sw2485B-ms98-a-0063 386.044750 394.014750 what they did was well see what they did was okay they uh wro[te]- they wrote to all the initial people you know the the oldest ones
sw2485B-ms98-a-0064 394.014750 403.255000 okay then those in turn got a hold of these other ones and they had like i think there was four or five different people that would call
sw2485B-ms98-a-0065 403.255000 415.134625 you know some of them_1 if they didn't have their addresses and all on and you know they told them_1 that what we had to do was when we sent back in our information we had to tell them_1 how many people were going to be coming
sw2485B-ms98-a-0066 415.134625 428.916000 you know and then when they when they talked to us or when they sent us the letter it uh [noise] you know to get the information and all it asked you know will you be willing to bring and you had to check off what all you would be willing to bring
sw2485B-ms98-a-0067 428.916000 436.691875 and so really there wasn't any problem with that's the reason it ended up in a church because i mean there was just so many of them_1
sw2485B-ms98-a-0068 436.691875 444.320500 but it turned out so much better like that because everybody knew they knew ahead of time how many people to expect
sw2485B-ms98-a-0069 444.320500 449.208875 now if there was a sickness or something like that i mean you know you're not going to lose that many
sw2485B-ms98-a-0070 449.208875 450.477750 [silence]
sw2485B-ms98-a-0071 450.477750 452.037125 right
sw2485B-ms98-a-0072 452.037125 455.448375 [silence]
sw2485B-ms98-a-0073 455.448375 456.831875 okay well
sw2485B-ms98-a-0074 456.831875 460.403125 [silence]
sw2485B-ms98-a-0075 460.403125 473.038875 well see then okay if you wanted them_1 both to come then you would put you would have put that down on the list and you would have sent you would have been the one that sent their invitation to them and ask for their information
sw2485B-ms98-a-0076 473.038875 475.449000 to send back to those other people
sw2485B-ms98-a-0077 475.449000 487.089125 right because once it went to the the oldest people and then they knew who they wanted to invite then they sent their little things to us okay it was up to me
sw2485B-ms98-a-0078 487.089125 493.608500 who i was going to you know whether i wanted my kids and you know my any of my family to come
sw2485B-ms98-a-0079 493.608500 495.062875 so
sw2485B-ms98-a-0080 495.062875 502.575125 and then you know it never did like if i didn't want somebody to come then i just wouldn't send them one of the questionnaires
sw2485B-ms98-a-0081 502.575125 505.539375 so there really wasn't a problem that a way
sw2485B-ms98-a-0082 505.539375 506.926750 [silence]
sw2485B-ms98-a-0083 506.926750 514.954000 well but i tell you what that's the neatest book we've got course we've got well you know we've still got it and they charged us i think it was like
sw2485B-ms98-a-0084 514.954000 525.031125 it was like five or six dollars i can't remember exactly you know that we paid for the book to be printed and it's not uh it's not a hard back book it's just a
sw2485B-ms98-a-0085 525.031125 534.837500 oh like a you know folder type thing but it has the entire you know it has everybody that you could ever imagine and some you couldn't [laughter]
sw2485B-ms98-a-0086 534.837500 539.174875 and it'll be something my kids will have you know just like
sw2485B-ms98-a-0087 539.174875 550.072375 yeah because if you stop and think i don't know if you're like me but i know very little about before my grandparents i mean very very little about it
sw2485B-ms98-a-0088 550.072375 572.027625 [silence]
sw2485B-ms98-a-0089 572.027625 573.216125 yeah
sw2485B-ms98-a-0090 573.216125 581.460375 [silence]
sw2485B-ms98-a-0091 581.460375 593.429375 maybe what you could do if you couldn't get into a full family reunion and you wanted to go back some but then usually when you find out some information from like your parents
sw2485B-ms98-a-0092 593.429375 599.002000 then you can find out from you know you can find somebody else that can tell you something else about the[se]-
