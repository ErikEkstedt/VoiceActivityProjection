sw2435A-ms98-a-0034 168.668875 170.697125 what was the last comedy you saw
sw2435A-ms98-a-0035 170.697125 176.071750 [silence]

sw2435A-ms98-a-0038 188.782375 202.096375 the last uh in fact i guess this was the last movie i saw i said that wrong um the last movie i saw was The Hard Way with uh Michael J Fox well that really wasn't too bad it
sw2435A-ms98-a-0039 202.096375 215.836625 there were you know he's supposed you know he's this actor right and he's he's playing a a cop well he's he's he's hanging around with a cop trying to pick up the the stuff i think he did an excellent job in not being too much of a cop
sw2435A-ms98-a-0040 215.836625 225.297250 you know what i mean there there were times when he was like you know he'd be running with a gun or whatever he didn't look like a cop when he did it and i was so impressed with that because
sw2435A-ms98-a-0041 225.297250 238.368125 you know you y[ou]- oh yeah because i mean yeah because_1 i everybody grows up looking at these cop movies and trying to you know to imitate them or whatever and and uh you know i thought he did such an excellent job of not
sw2435A-ms98-a-0042 238.368125 250.482250 going that far now you know at the by the end he was looking more like a cop but at the beginning of the movie and all through the middle part you know he was he was trying to you know trying to get it but he wasn't there yet but you could tell
sw2435A-ms98-a-0043 250.482250 263.432875 like i said i thought was a real good acting and writing job both you know because i think or directing job i think they did a real good job of that and um James Woods i think is who it was did an excellent job as the cop i mean you know he just yeah
sw2435A-ms98-a-0044 263.432875 271.046125 yeah and there were there were some definite um [noise] uh should i say tense moments with him in there so
sw2435A-ms98-a-0045 271.046125 273.610625 [silence]
sw2435A-ms98-a-0046 273.610625 285.581625 yes i i i had seen it before Christmas but i took a uh a date to it uh about a month ago so i i i've seen it the second time not too long ago so
sw2435A-ms98-a-0047 285.581625 289.323250 i really enjoyed it of course the bad thing about it was uh
sw2435A-ms98-a-0048 289.323250 302.867500 uh the the second time i saw it i didn't really enjoy it as much and i was kind of surprised at that i thought that would be one of those that i would love to watch over and over again but before i- maybe it's just the idea of my reaction the first time i laughed so hard i was hoarse
sw2435A-ms98-a-0049 302.867500 315.120250 i mean you know i really was i was hoarse getting out of there and maybe i just laughed so hard the first time that i didn't have it i mean it just wasn't as funny the second time because i had just gone overboard the first time i don't know but
sw2435A-ms98-a-0050 315.120250 320.014500 yeah i mean it was it was a great movie though i loved the movie [noise]
sw2435A-ms98-a-0051 320.014500 322.268875 [silence]
sw2435A-ms98-a-0052 322.268875 327.341500 [laughter] i love those movies
sw2435A-ms98-a-0053 327.341500 328.650000 [silence]
sw2435A-ms98-a-0054 328.650000 329.910875 oh yeah
sw2435A-ms98-a-0055 329.910875 331.907125 [silence]
sw2435A-ms98-a-0056 331.907125 337.774625 well you have to see them more than that i mean you know i- i still catch things in Airplane that i didn't catch i mean
sw2435A-ms98-a-0057 337.774625 341.619750 it's its amazing i love those movies i really do
sw2435A-ms98-a-0058 341.619750 343.795125 yeah
sw2435A-ms98-a-0059 343.795125 346.510125 [laughter] oh yeah
sw2435A-ms98-a-0060 346.510125 351.549500 [silence]
sw2435A-ms98-a-0061 351.549500 353.365125 uh-huh
sw2435A-ms98-a-0062 353.365125 357.606375 oh isn't it though you know but that's at least the good thing about
sw2435A-ms98-a-0063 357.606375 371.141250 you know the Texas organization letting you buy the tickets cheaper but [vocalized-noise] yeah that's exactly what i was going to say i keep i keep not doing it until after i'm there and then all of a sudden i'm saying i wish i'd bought these things 
sw2435A-ms98-a-0064 371.141250 380.163125 easily yeah yeah and that's and then you know if you want popcorn and stuff it's just i mean uh it's incredible
sw2435A-ms98-a-0065 380.163125 385.728500 [silence]
sw2435A-ms98-a-0066 385.728500 389.788625 no no it's nowhere near that expensive
sw2435A-ms98-a-0067 389.788625 391.494500 [silence]
sw2435A-ms98-a-0068 391.494500 400.892250 [vocalized-noise] and it it's just the idea that these uh these actors you know live in such lavish style i mean it's as simple as that
sw2435A-ms98-a-0069 400.892250 411.760000 yeah and as long as we keep paying the money for it they are going to keep paying them you know yes oh yeah oh that was that was an excellent movie
sw2435A-ms98-a-0070 411.760000 413.819125 [silence]
sw2435A-ms98-a-0071 413.819125 422.255625 [laughter] no don't don't that needs the big screen it really and truly does because to get the feeling
sw2435A-ms98-a-0072 422.255625 431.731875 of like when the buffaloes are when they're chasing the buffaloes and everything you've got to be where you feel it you really truly do i would i mean
sw2435A-ms98-a-0073 431.731875 441.448000 you know [vocalized-noise] i guess my first instinct was to wait for the video too but i'm glad i didn't i really and truly am i mean it that mov[ie]- that was one movie i came out impressed
sw2435A-ms98-a-0074 441.448000 453.889500 i really and truly did i mean i have absolutely no problems with them winning seven Oscars none at all i mean i'm normally i'm one of these people that i don't like one one movie taking all the honors i i wanted him to win best
sw2435A-ms98-a-0075 453.889500 466.742875 best actor on top of it i mean it was just he was like i said he was now i wouldn't have i wouldn't given the supporting actress or actresses either one but the uh you know even though they were okay the girl in it
sw2435A-ms98-a-0076 466.742875 479.319625 uh they uh somebody made an interesting observation now that i think back on it i'd say yeah i can't believe that either she was the only indian to have her hair done at all times you know what i mean you know
sw2435A-ms98-a-0077 479.319625 488.135875 it was just too perfect at all times that was a mistake that they made they shouldn't have done it now the best the supporting actor he was good
sw2435A-ms98-a-0078 488.135875 495.915875 but from what i heard the guy who got it was better so i you know i can see that but oh
sw2435A-ms98-a-0079 495.915875 502.478125 oh well there are there is one spot that was just a little bit on the gory side but um it's it's
sw2435A-ms98-a-0080 502.478125 503.580500 [silence]
sw2435A-ms98-a-0081 503.580500 516.257375 okay no problems it it's just the idea that there is this one spot where the white man has come by and killed a bunch a buffalo and just stripped its hide the hides so there's you know there's
sw2435A-ms98-a-0082 516.257375 518.971750 [silence]
sw2435A-ms98-a-0083 518.971750 522.465375 yeah but well
sw2435A-ms98-a-0084 522.465375 526.905250 and and of course and well yeah that and plus i mean
sw2435A-ms98-a-0085 526.905250 539.399750 part of it is the idea that he goes with them on a buffalo hunt so i mean they are killing buffaloes in it but they don't stress that very much they really don't and i think it's an excellent movie for if if she enjoys
sw2435A-ms98-a-0086 539.399750 543.549000 movies i think it'll work pretty good yeah
sw2435A-ms98-a-0087 543.549000 546.449500 it's it's it's a long movie
sw2435A-ms98-a-0088 546.449500 547.986375 [silence]
sw2435A-ms98-a-0089 547.986375 549.874875 oh yeah
sw2435A-ms98-a-0090 549.874875 555.749875 i may have to see the video i hadn't even thought of that
sw2435A-ms98-a-0091 555.749875 557.301750 [silence]
sw2435A-ms98-a-0092 557.301750 560.029000 uh-huh uh-huh
sw2435A-ms98-a-0093 560.029000 562.189250 [silence]
sw2435A-ms98-a-0094 562.189250 563.136375 yeah
sw2435A-ms98-a-0095 563.136375 565.303375 [silence]
sw2435A-ms98-a-0096 565.303375 576.543500 well yeah i kind of like it when they do that because the video like i said there are certain things you can't do with a video and the idea that they may put a little extra in it i think is a good idea
sw2435A-ms98-a-0097 576.543500 588.086625 because_1 i mean when you rent a video videos of course are not cheaper either and um and so the idea of getting a little extra with it i think is a good idea because they they make bundles of money off those things
sw2435A-ms98-a-0098 588.086625 589.656375 [silence]
sw2435A-ms98-a-0099 589.656375 591.798125 oh i do too
sw2435A-ms98-a-0100 591.798125 600.269125 yeah but not enough yeah i'm getting to the point where you know i watch well i watch Nick at Nite
