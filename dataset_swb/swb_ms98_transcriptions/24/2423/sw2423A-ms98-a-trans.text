sw2423A-ms98-a-0049 236.522500 238.132125 [laughter]
sw2423A-ms98-a-0050 238.132125 239.861000 [silence]
sw2423A-ms98-a-0051 239.861000 247.859500 yeah it's it's it's like a fad thing i- i don't know it's i've never heard of it in the last five years i've used so much of it that
sw2423A-ms98-a-0052 247.859500 249.173125 i hate to
sw2423A-ms98-a-0053 249.173125 250.922125 [silence]
sw2423A-ms98-a-0054 250.922125 253.329250 yeah it is
sw2423A-ms98-a-0055 253.329250 254.999250 [laughter]
sw2423A-ms98-a-0056 254.999250 256.005875 [silence]
sw2423A-ms98-a-0057 256.005875 260.457500 yeah it it looks really po[tent]- potent stuff
sw2423A-ms98-a-0058 260.457500 270.439750 but uh it's yeah i think it's the greatest stuff in the world though it's jeez they i make all kinds of things with it we make all kinds of things just with dried flowers
sw2423A-ms98-a-0059 270.439750 278.795375 i- i almost want to start a business doing it but i don't i i'm so uh timid when it comes to starting a business
sw2423A-ms98-a-0060 278.795375 286.457500 yeah it is especially with the being in on the creative as[pect]- aspect on the crafty end
sw2423A-ms98-a-0061 286.457500 292.978375 you know after a while you make some stuff then you start looking at it go boy this this is kind of ugly [laughter]
sw2423A-ms98-a-0062 292.978375 303.912375 but i know someone who does a lot of woodworking for a hobby um he does it believe it or not i wouldn't imagine why but to get out of the house away from his wife
sw2423A-ms98-a-0063 303.912375 317.613125 because_1 he's a seasonal worker he works in the construction and up here it's almost a pattern i mean you see your fathers do it then their sons do it what they do is they work construction then they get laid off for like twelve weeks in the winter
sw2423A-ms98-a-0064 317.613125 329.704625 and uh this guy was going nuts and his uh son built him a garage and got him some uh oh i don't know what the equipment's called but planes and things
sw2423A-ms98-a-0065 329.704625 340.913375 and s[et]- set him up and h[e]- he makes all kinds of furniture for um his kids and he makes uh uh like little kids' furniture
sw2423A-ms98-a-0066 340.913375 343.760000 he gets right into it and uh
sw2423A-ms98-a-0067 343.760000 345.225625 [noise]
sw2423A-ms98-a-0068 345.225625 371.972750 [silence]
sw2423A-ms98-a-0069 371.972750 374.837625 yeah it's a it's a really good thing
sw2423A-ms98-a-0070 374.837625 386.073875 yeah because_1 it's keeping him sane and plus it's keeping his [laughter-marriage] so and and plus he's getting on in his years now he's he's not that old but he's getting
sw2423A-ms98-a-0071 386.073875 400.191250 to the point where he needed an extra boost to to do something like that and uh it's really it's it's uh hard work i couldn't imagine taking lumber raw lumber and trying to make something out of it he d[owels]-
sw2423A-ms98-a-0072 400.191250 409.839250 he dowels everything and it's all got to line up [laughter] and uh i don't think he goofs too much i don't to see too much scrap around
sw2423A-ms98-a-0073 409.839250 416.447250 [silence]
sw2423A-ms98-a-0074 416.447250 419.415375 God i'm envious [laughter]
sw2423A-ms98-a-0075 419.415375 431.139625 [silence]

sw2423A-ms98-a-0077 432.752000 441.619625 is it going to be really dry it are you pl[ant]- are no i always plant trees in the fall i don't know why so the the cold weather can kill them_1
sw2423A-ms98-a-0078 441.619625 443.385000 but i guess
sw2423A-ms98-a-0079 443.385000 460.355750 [silence]
sw2423A-ms98-a-0080 460.355750 466.215125 oh that's good i guess they they say you can plant them_1 in the spring or the fall um
