sw2471A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 14.545250 well we haven't really heard that much in the news lately about uh US involvement in Latin America since uh all this Middle East crisis began so i haven't really paid that much attention like since [noise]
sw2471A-ms98-a-0002 14.545250 19.327375 back in August when all of the news and all of the media began to focus
sw2471A-ms98-a-0003 19.327375 28.734875 in on um Iraq and the so the last thing that i remember hearing that much about is the Iran-Contra
sw2471A-ms98-a-0004 28.734875 34.467625 scandal that happened in the Reagan presidency can you think of anything else that's [laughter-happened] recently

sw2471A-ms98-a-0006 48.260250 49.829875 um-hum
sw2471A-ms98-a-0007 49.829875 69.206750 [silence]
sw2471A-ms98-a-0008 69.206750 76.025000 [noise] well the only uh references that i have seen lately has been uh [noise] in part of the
sw2471A-ms98-a-0009 76.025000 84.812000 {overmilitarization} of Iraq was due to companies selling them arms and things and and they made references to in the past
sw2471A-ms98-a-0010 84.812000 89.669875 [noise] how we have given arms to uh
sw2471A-ms98-a-0011 89.669875 103.770125 Nicaragua and to other places in Latin America and that those might turn around and haunt us [laughter-someday] i mean not not to this large scale as Iraq but that whenever we give arms to people
sw2471A-ms98-a-0012 103.770125 114.304375 a[s]- as we did and as we sold arms to [noise] pardon me to Iraq when we wanted them to fight Iran and then uh and then it turned around and
sw2471A-ms98-a-0013 114.304375 130.832500 [silence]
sw2471A-ms98-a-0014 130.832500 143.660000 um-hum [noise] and i know when i spent the time that i've studied in Mexico uh since Spanish was one of my majors in college [noise] that uh there was a kind of a lot of resentment there towards America
sw2471A-ms98-a-0015 143.660000 148.735000 about uh like you say using them you our interest there is
sw2471A-ms98-a-0016 148.735000 162.668750 you know what profit we could make off of any kind of relationship with them and that we weren't normally very interested in them and they have in other in most Latin American countries they
sw2471A-ms98-a-0017 162.668750 166.905000 there are a lot of the kind of problems that we've
sw2471A-ms98-a-0018 166.905000 173.350750 fought for in other countries you know that they have corruption and and they don't have um
sw2471A-ms98-a-0019 173.350750 178.627375 [noise] i mean there's just very few really modern cities
sw2471A-ms98-a-0020 178.627375 182.271375 [silence]
sw2471A-ms98-a-0021 182.271375 183.999750 um-hum
sw2471A-ms98-a-0022 183.999750 209.987250 [silence]
sw2471A-ms98-a-0023 209.987250 222.354750 well that's right because that's just so much of the way that they make their money and so many communities have uh have to have that for farming [laughter] and they don't look at it so much as you know
sw2471A-ms98-a-0024 222.354750 224.480500 [silence]
sw2471A-ms98-a-0025 224.480500 227.666750 um-hum that's right
sw2471A-ms98-a-0026 227.666750 231.474625 [silence]
sw2471A-ms98-a-0027 231.474625 236.731875 and i think it's really very sad that north of the border
sw2471A-ms98-a-0028 236.731875 248.707125 you know the United States and Canada is so different from the S[outh]- from South America and Central America there's really a disparity between the um
sw2471A-ms98-a-0029 248.707125 253.269125 [noise] what y[ou]- i would call civilization of the countries you know
sw2471A-ms98-a-0030 253.269125 254.419750 [silence]

sw2471A-ms98-a-0033 263.899375 274.477375 yes it's really kind of sad and that we would go all the way to Iraq and that we would be very concerned with the situation between Jerusalem and
sw2471A-ms98-a-0034 274.477375 284.319000 uh Israel and the Middle East Arab countries and and when we have when we have a lot of problems r[ight]- right in our own back door
sw2471A-ms98-a-0035 284.319000 287.194125 [silence]
sw2471A-ms98-a-0036 287.194125 293.210000 hm [noise] so i guess we've kind of neglected Latin America
sw2471A-ms98-a-0037 293.210000 297.092250 [silence]
sw2471A-ms98-a-0038 297.092250 303.819250 righ[t]- [laughter-recently] yeah fairly recently well that's really sad i hadn't thought about that in a long time
sw2471A-ms98-a-0039 303.819250 309.410125 well i guess then i will go but i made me stop and think a minute about
sw2471A-ms98-a-0040 309.410125 320.611125 not worrying so much about the Middle East crisis i know that it's not settled but [noise] there are other areas that we could focus our attention on well thank you you have a good day bye-bye [noise]
sw2471A-ms98-a-0041 320.611125 323.201250 [noise]
