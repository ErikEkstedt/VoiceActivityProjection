sw2493B-ms98-a-0047 204.971250 219.345250 it's getting pretty you know it's kind of like a Dallas type thing you know but it's more of it it takes place in LA and it's this law office and all the cases they take and the and the uh interoffice uh
sw2493B-ms98-a-0048 219.345250 226.278625 uh politics and so forth people trying to maneuver and get power and back stabbing and
sw2493B-ms98-a-0049 226.278625 241.002000 also helping each other and you know if you know all the love interoffice love affairs and uh all that all that kind of stuff and you know power struggles to see who's going to be the next uh uh oh
sw2493B-ms98-a-0050 241.002000 251.258000 president of the law firm or whatever and that kind of thing and uh and then of course they always have a lot of court cases and they show where they actually have courtroom drama
sw2493B-ms98-a-0051 251.258000 253.954750 type thing where they're trying to
sw2493B-ms98-a-0052 253.954750 266.746375 you know you're always sitting there trying to guess at the end of the show you know and they always have the verdicts you know and you're always trying to out guess is he going to be guilty or innocent or whatever and they always put you know twists and turns twists
sw2493B-ms98-a-0053 266.746375 274.239125 yeah they throw a lot of twists and turns in like like one of the recent shows there was this really uh
sw2493B-ms98-a-0054 274.239125 278.978250 a young woman who uh was accused of killing her
sw2493B-ms98-a-0055 278.978250 293.802250 millionaire husband who was you know much older than she was like you know in her early twenties and he was in his sixties and he was she was accused of killing him for his money and she said no she wasn't and the and this law firm took on the case and got her off
sw2493B-ms98-a-0056 293.802250 302.690125 um and uh and you know you think she's innocent all along you know and just you know because_1 because_1 of her circumstances
sw2493B-ms98-a-0057 302.690125 310.198125 that you know that's why people thought she had done it you know because it just looked so obvious that she had done it and that's why everybody assumed she had
sw2493B-ms98-a-0058 310.198125 321.475125 and so they get her off and at the very end of the case after it's over he's talking with her and he figures out that she really did do it after all a uh after after he got after he got her off
sw2493B-ms98-a-0059 321.475125 332.684625 well that's how the show that's how the show ended it just left you hanging there like you know like you set me up you fed me all this in[formation]- information you know that made it look like this other person was guilty you know and
sw2493B-ms98-a-0060 332.684625 344.461125 and that's how he basically got her off by by casting a shadow of doubt saying well this other his daughter did it you know and because_1 this other will was had her name on it you know and all this kind of stuff but actually
sw2493B-ms98-a-0061 344.461125 352.330125 she had done it after all and he figured it out after he made her innocent and then that was right before he was going out to the big news conference you know to
sw2493B-ms98-a-0062 352.330125 367.219500 to talk to the reporters and stuff you know and how does it feel be you know to get her off the hook and this and that and they he went out there knowing that she was really guilty [laughter] so that kind of thing so it's a fun show then i like comedies also like uh
sw2493B-ms98-a-0063 367.219500 376.572625 there's a show ca[ll]- i watch Roseanne once in a while uh you you've heard of her probably yeah yeah
