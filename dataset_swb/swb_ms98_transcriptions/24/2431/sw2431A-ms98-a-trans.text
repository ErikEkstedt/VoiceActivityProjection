sw2431A-ms98-a-0021 51.234000 57.543625 yeah it sure does i really would like to have something like that and i'm hoping that by you know
sw2431A-ms98-a-0022 57.543625 62.553375 that's like right now my husband would like for me to buy another vehicle right now
sw2431A-ms98-a-0023 62.553375 67.886875 but i keep saying lets put it off lets put it off because i'm hoping they'll get so many better features
sw2431A-ms98-a-0024 67.886875 76.484750 well just like that air bag i think that thing is fantastic cause i've seen some of the you know like the head on collision type things where they had it
sw2431A-ms98-a-0025 76.484750 87.661875 and people walk away from it we had one here i guess it was about three weeks ago and the people walked away from the wreck with no scratches nothing you know a few bruises
sw2431A-ms98-a-0026 87.661875 92.816250 [silence]

sw2431A-ms98-a-0031 98.649000 105.431000 i tell you what i would not i would not buy a car that had the seat belt where it was hooked under the door
sw2431A-ms98-a-0032 105.431000 119.451500 [silence]
sw2431A-ms98-a-0033 119.451500 123.330875 well you know what the average person would you ever have thought of that
sw2431A-ms98-a-0034 123.330875 124.532000 [silence]
sw2431A-ms98-a-0035 124.532000 126.302625 i mean now i[t]-
sw2431A-ms98-a-0036 126.302625 127.908500 you probably would not
sw2431A-ms98-a-0037 127.908500 144.989125 [silence]
sw2431A-ms98-a-0038 144.989125 146.331625 right
sw2431A-ms98-a-0039 146.331625 151.132375 because you always think i mean i don't know maybe you don't but just like me
sw2431A-ms98-a-0040 151.132375 163.673875 i always think well you know these things must be safe but that's just like i don't know if you've heard about it a few years ago they said you know before they had the like the shoulder strap thing where it was just like a seat belt that goes across your waist
sw2431A-ms98-a-0041 163.673875 178.402375 all these people were a[nd]- and it was on one of those kind of shows like 20/20 these people were like paralyzed and because it threw them forward but they were hooked at the waist and so it like you know did something to their spinal cord
sw2431A-ms98-a-0042 178.402375 180.703375 then they were like paraplegics
sw2431A-ms98-a-0043 180.703375 199.765500 [silence]
sw2431A-ms98-a-0044 199.765500 201.123250 right

sw2431A-ms98-a-0054 241.276750 248.754625 huh the reason that we're thinking about something like that we took a trip in my brother in law and sister in laws to Florida
sw2431A-ms98-a-0055 248.754625 256.004125 and like i said i mean we're not that old but my husband works for the state and after a certain amount of years you can retire
sw2431A-ms98-a-0056 256.004125 264.832375 and when he retires i'm retiring well as soon as i get my quarters in i'm retiring period that's it you know no more [laughter] and so
sw2431A-ms98-a-0057 264.832375 272.422250 uh-huh and we wanted to travel well that was really nice traveling but you know i like to know more
sw2431A-ms98-a-0058 272.422250 281.795500 i mean hear about more people that have things like that you know and see what they think of them the different kinds because i've only ridden in the one that's it
sw2431A-ms98-a-0059 281.795500 285.322000 uh shoot i can't even think of the name of it now
sw2431A-ms98-a-0060 285.322000 289.799625 [silence]
sw2431A-ms98-a-0061 289.799625 291.090000 uh-huh
sw2431A-ms98-a-0062 291.090000 301.832750 [silence]
sw2431A-ms98-a-0063 301.832750 302.889000 yeah
sw2431A-ms98-a-0064 302.889000 318.310375 [silence]
sw2431A-ms98-a-0065 318.310375 319.461125 yeah
sw2431A-ms98-a-0066 319.461125 327.410875 [silence]
sw2431A-ms98-a-0067 327.410875 328.328875 uh-huh
sw2431A-ms98-a-0068 328.328875 331.779500 [silence]
sw2431A-ms98-a-0069 331.779500 338.538500 yeah well now this one that we went in it did baby what kind of van was that that we went to Florida in
sw2431A-ms98-a-0070 338.538500 339.904875 a what
sw2431A-ms98-a-0071 339.904875 342.570500 a Ford Ford what you remember
sw2431A-ms98-a-0072 342.570500 343.962500 [silence]
sw2431A-ms98-a-0073 343.962500 346.616750 he was trying to think of what the name of it was
sw2431A-ms98-a-0074 346.616750 360.903000 this was a big one i mean it was a big one it had the it had the front and the back and you know it has the uh backseat let down into a double i mean a queen size bed and then it had the two swivels in the middle and then
sw2431A-ms98-a-0075 360.903000 363.155375 the two swivel chairs on the front
sw2431A-ms98-a-0076 363.155375 368.088875 and i mean it was fantastic and it got good gas mileage but
sw2431A-ms98-a-0077 368.088875 369.667250 i don't know i don't really
sw2431A-ms98-a-0078 369.667250 375.726750 i don't i want something i can drive too you know and i was scared to drive that big van
sw2431A-ms98-a-0079 375.726750 387.921625 [silence]
sw2431A-ms98-a-0080 387.921625 399.837500 well do you does yours have that this one had it where you know you would see something coming in the rear view mirror i mean not the rear those little side mirror things and it would look like it was further back than it was
sw2431A-ms98-a-0081 399.837500 405.063250 [silence]
sw2431A-ms98-a-0082 405.063250 409.867000 yeah does yours do that too oh i was wondering if all vans did that
sw2431A-ms98-a-0083 409.867000 420.477000 [silence]
sw2431A-ms98-a-0084 420.477000 421.914125 uh-huh
sw2431A-ms98-a-0085 421.914125 427.923125 [silence]
sw2431A-ms98-a-0086 427.923125 441.472375 yeah well see that's the reason that we couldn't make really make them at first we were going to get a pick up truck with a camper on the back of it but then that gas mileage was just atrocious i mean it's unreal it's
sw2431A-ms98-a-0087 441.472375 443.681125 you just practically don't get any
sw2431A-ms98-a-0088 443.681125 447.878625 [silence]
sw2431A-ms98-a-0089 447.878625 456.482000 yeah and then uh he talked about a van and i said well you know i don't know i don't know how the gas is on most of these
sw2431A-ms98-a-0090 456.482000 466.108375 and another thing was that's the reason i said you know there was such a big difference you know in a little economy car but i said maybe we might have to get us an economy car to pull along
sw2431A-ms98-a-0091 466.108375 475.583250 when we went somewhere but really and truly the safety features but i wouldn't get one that if it had the seat belts on the door now i wouldn't get it period
sw2431A-ms98-a-0092 475.583250 480.536500 [silence]
sw2431A-ms98-a-0093 480.536500 482.423750 oh that would be good
sw2431A-ms98-a-0094 482.423750 499.870000 [silence]
sw2431A-ms98-a-0095 499.870000 510.599750 oh i think so too i don't think they should do away with the seat belts now i'm but i think you need the shoulder thing i think you need the thing around your waist but i think you need that bag to pop out too
sw2431A-ms98-a-0096 510.599750 514.135375 you know because i know so many people
sw2431A-ms98-a-0097 514.135375 522.610000 here that have been killed in head on collisions where maybe if they had they had that that air bag they may still be walking around
sw2431A-ms98-a-0098 522.610000 530.315750 but uh i think it's fantastic i wish they required it in everything every new car that came out i wish they would require it in it
sw2431A-ms98-a-0099 530.315750 544.264000 [silence]
sw2431A-ms98-a-0100 544.264000 546.101250 yeah
sw2431A-ms98-a-0101 546.101250 559.753375 well no because what they would do is that's what they're going to plan on you know they would have to do it the insurance company would have to do the same thing they're given like a ten year time limit
sw2431A-ms98-a-0102 559.753375 568.282500 where okay these cars i guess they figure all the old cars will be off the roads or something by the in ten years
sw2431A-ms98-a-0103 568.282500 575.353250 and then you know if you didn't have a car that had one in it then your insurance would go up enormously
sw2431A-ms98-a-0104 575.353250 578.803500 [silence]
sw2431A-ms98-a-0105 578.803500 580.507625 oh that's okay
sw2431A-ms98-a-0106 580.507625 582.597000 [silence]
sw2431A-ms98-a-0107 582.597000 583.818875 okay
sw2431A-ms98-a-0108 583.818875 585.402000 well you you too
sw2431A-ms98-a-0109 585.402000 586.428125 [noise] all right bye bye
