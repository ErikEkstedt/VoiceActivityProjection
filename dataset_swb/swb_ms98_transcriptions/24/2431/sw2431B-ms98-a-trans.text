sw2431B-ms98-a-0013 50.023750 52.203375 does that make a difference to you
sw2431B-ms98-a-0014 52.203375 66.805000 [silence]
sw2431B-ms98-a-0015 66.805000 68.515500 yeah like what

sw2431B-ms98-a-0019 84.110000 85.818000 that's nice
sw2431B-ms98-a-0020 85.818000 86.997375 did
sw2431B-ms98-a-0021 86.997375 93.648000 did you see the uh i don't know if it was 20/20 last Thursday or Friday night on on seat belts
sw2431B-ms98-a-0022 93.648000 97.624125 did that scare you a little bit with the lady being thrown out
sw2431B-ms98-a-0023 97.624125 99.248375 and run over
sw2431B-ms98-a-0024 99.248375 105.479250 [silence]
sw2431B-ms98-a-0025 105.479250 112.383375 that really sc[ared]- i guess i that that a little more than scared me that irritated me uh that because it
sw2431B-ms98-a-0026 112.383375 115.991625 if if it it surely didn't come as a surprise that
sw2431B-ms98-a-0027 115.991625 120.409500 that if the door came open the lady would fall out i mean and
sw2431B-ms98-a-0028 120.409500 123.515750 [silence]
sw2431B-ms98-a-0029 123.515750 130.832375 um no probably well i'm not [vocalized-noise] the problem is i'm i'm really into cars and so it's not a uh
sw2431B-ms98-a-0030 130.832375 136.960375 um for me it's it's a real it's a real consideration um
sw2431B-ms98-a-0031 136.960375 147.044875 uh and and uh the but no i probably wouldn't have even though i'm really quite into cars it's it's probably my main hobby
sw2431B-ms98-a-0032 147.044875 162.588625 [silence]
sw2431B-ms98-a-0033 162.588625 163.748500 yeah
sw2431B-ms98-a-0034 163.748500 166.824250 [silence]
sw2431B-ms98-a-0035 166.824250 167.736375 uh-huh

sw2431B-ms98-a-0037 177.358125 178.783125 yeah
sw2431B-ms98-a-0038 178.783125 180.352750 [silence]
sw2431B-ms98-a-0039 180.352750 190.654875 yeah you know Road and Track had a had some articles on and particularly with with backseat uh with some where kids were were sitting in the backseat with seat belts on and they were thrown forward
sw2431B-ms98-a-0040 190.654875 202.811000 into the front seat and there was enough stretching the combination of stretching the spine to uh par[alyze]- i mean to serious injury even though they were they were still locked in the the forced to go so really if your sitting in the backseat
sw2431B-ms98-a-0041 202.811000 210.591000 you're better off not to have your seatbelt on if it's just a seatbelt we have a van that uh just has seat belts in the back doesn't have a shoulder harness
sw2431B-ms98-a-0042 210.591000 212.873500 [silence]
sw2431B-ms98-a-0043 212.873500 223.197750 i have an Arrow Star van we really do uh it's it's a mini van we've had it goodness in May will be five years and uh they replace the engine at sixty thousand under extended warranty
sw2431B-ms98-a-0044 223.197750 227.672250 and the transmission was replaced but they really are nifty um
sw2431B-ms98-a-0045 227.672250 233.819750 the mini van it's actually we had a station wagon before and it's a foot or two shorter than a we had a regular size station wagon
sw2431B-ms98-a-0046 233.819750 236.203000 and it really um
sw2431B-ms98-a-0047 236.203000 241.090125 we like it it the [vocalized-noise] interestingly enough one of the features we like are the electric locks
sw2431B-ms98-a-0048 241.090125 247.569000 [silence]
sw2431B-ms98-a-0049 247.569000 248.930000 uh-huh
sw2431B-ms98-a-0050 248.930000 259.316125 [silence]
sw2431B-ms98-a-0051 259.316125 260.585500 uh-huh
sw2431B-ms98-a-0052 260.585500 261.958625 yeah
sw2431B-ms98-a-0053 261.958625 265.607375 well but the did you did you go to Florida in a van
sw2431B-ms98-a-0054 265.607375 275.395625 [silence]
sw2431B-ms98-a-0055 275.395625 276.738125 yeah

sw2431B-ms98-a-0057 278.796625 280.373000 yeah
sw2431B-ms98-a-0058 280.373000 282.549250 which what kind was it
sw2431B-ms98-a-0059 282.549250 285.164500 [silence]
sw2431B-ms98-a-0060 285.164500 290.368750 what what was remarkable this van even with the we have two kids and we went to Disney World
sw2431B-ms98-a-0061 290.368750 302.490875 uh actually i grew up in Alabama and i went to see my mother and then went on down to Disney World and it got better than i think twenty two twenty three miles a gallon and this was with the air conditioner on and and you know
sw2431B-ms98-a-0062 302.490875 312.825750 four people with with luggage and uh course this grant it that's you know it's been four years ago but it's remarkable that the that the bigger vans uh they're
sw2431B-ms98-a-0063 312.825750 318.647250 uh my boss just bought a a pick up truck and uh he only gets seventeen miles a gallon
sw2431B-ms98-a-0064 318.647250 327.792375 but it it has a big engine and it it pulls a boat and stuff but it's and it it's got the seats that and the other thing that is interesting is it has uh rear air conditioning
sw2431B-ms98-a-0065 327.792375 332.206750 and that that makes a lot of difference in those of us that live in warm climates
sw2431B-ms98-a-0066 332.206750 345.149125 [silence]
sw2431B-ms98-a-0067 345.149125 348.239875 well the big you know the big vans are all real nice
sw2431B-ms98-a-0068 348.239875 349.507875 yeah
sw2431B-ms98-a-0069 349.507875 350.870875 oh those are
sw2431B-ms98-a-0070 350.870875 352.258500 [silence]
sw2431B-ms98-a-0071 352.258500 353.355250 yeah

sw2431B-ms98-a-0075 362.242125 363.817875 all right
sw2431B-ms98-a-0076 363.817875 365.220375 [silence]
sw2431B-ms98-a-0077 365.220375 366.692750 they uh
sw2431B-ms98-a-0078 366.692750 373.049875 [silence]
sw2431B-ms98-a-0079 373.049875 373.659625 well
sw2431B-ms98-a-0080 373.659625 375.154125 [silence]
sw2431B-ms98-a-0081 375.154125 388.334000 well the mini the you'd be surprised if if you drive a one of the the mini vans uh fact there all more or less alike the the uh Chevrolet and uh well of course Oldsmobile has got one and Chryslers got one but they drive remarkably like cars
sw2431B-ms98-a-0082 388.334000 396.475125 [silence]
sw2431B-ms98-a-0083 396.475125 397.521250 yeah

sw2431B-ms98-a-0085 399.303875 405.760500 yeah but the little thing etched in it say objects are are closer than they appear or [laughter-something]
sw2431B-ms98-a-0086 405.760500 407.439875 yeah
sw2431B-ms98-a-0087 407.439875 409.197625 [silence]
sw2431B-ms98-a-0088 409.197625 420.821625 well you you can you can uh install those mirrors we've got the big side mirrors which are really nice i don't know if you've well if you've driven a pick up truck you know these are these uh mirrors are must be six inches across not nearly a foot high 
sw2431B-ms98-a-0089 420.821625 428.475125 and they really nice uh i'm on both sides actually they they fold so when you get in tight situations you can fold them back
sw2431B-ms98-a-0090 428.475125 429.817750 but there
sw2431B-ms98-a-0091 429.817750 435.530000 [silence]
sw2431B-ms98-a-0092 435.530000 436.848750 uh-huh

sw2431B-ms98-a-0094 439.655375 440.854125 um-hum
sw2431B-ms98-a-0095 440.854125 442.660875 uh
sw2431B-ms98-a-0096 442.660875 448.879000 well they have got some of the newer ones they you know with the aerodynamic features you can get pretty pretty decent gas mileage
sw2431B-ms98-a-0097 448.879000 462.243625 [silence]
sw2431B-ms98-a-0098 462.243625 462.884000 oh

sw2431B-ms98-a-0103 473.298000 481.105500 yeah interesting enough Ford announced that i think in ninety two they're going to put uh air bags in their in their vans
sw2431B-ms98-a-0104 481.105500 493.317625 so uh and i think i i believe safety i i i i really do believe in this stuff uh and i i think it's important [vocalized-noise] i'm not the air bags are a good deal but um
sw2431B-ms98-a-0105 493.317625 500.826000 surprisingly uh they're uh you really need to do you need a combination of both the air bags and the uh
sw2431B-ms98-a-0106 500.826000 502.459750 and your seatbelt so
sw2431B-ms98-a-0107 502.459750 505.382625 [silence]
sw2431B-ms98-a-0108 505.382625 506.434500 yeah

sw2431B-ms98-a-0116 530.767250 533.699125 it would be interesting to see what that'd do to our insurance rates
sw2431B-ms98-a-0117 533.699125 543.167625 you know if if uh if the insurance companies says it says we're not going to pay you know a claim if if the car doesn't have air bags
sw2431B-ms98-a-0118 543.167625 547.491500 would be interesting wouldn't it uh that wouldn't be fair but uh
sw2431B-ms98-a-0119 547.491500 559.041625 [silence]
sw2431B-ms98-a-0120 559.041625 560.357500 yeah

sw2431B-ms98-a-0126 585.978750 589.027750 [noise]
