sw2473B-ms98-a-0049 148.072625 159.165250 oh yeah yeah well we don't have a boat we usually fish off the shore or off the dock and my i've got a son that's a senior in high school and he just loves he loves fishing i- i don't have the patience that he does
sw2473B-ms98-a-0050 159.165250 172.529750 uh you know it's it's sitting there on the dock and you go a hour and nothing's happened he says no dad i know they're down there let's not go i know they're down there [laughter-and] [laughter-they're] [laughter-and] [laughter-they're] they're [laughter-gonna] bite [laughter-anytime] and uh 
sw2473B-ms98-a-0051 172.529750 173.574875 uh
sw2473B-ms98-a-0052 173.574875 181.493000 uh he got into a place where uh we were in there where there was a bunch of sand bass schooling and my goodness
sw2473B-ms98-a-0053 181.493000 194.098500 he was throwing this was one day last summer and he every as often as he could throw that hook out there he'd get one but we don't deplete the fish population because we pull them_1 up and look at them_1 admire them_1 and take them_1 off and throw them_1 back
sw2473B-ms98-a-0054 194.098500 198.321375 although he went somewhere with some friends last week and fished for catfish
sw2473B-ms98-a-0055 198.321375 208.676000 and got them_1 and i think it's the first time that he's ever that he's actually prepared and ate what they caught he and some friends of his the first time they've ever done anything but throw them_1 back
sw2473B-ms98-a-0056 208.676000 223.653375 but uh we w[e]- you know we we started with just rudimentary things like [laughter-worms] [laughter-and] night crawlers and uh and uh uh gone to uh minnows and can catch just a lot of sandies or even catfish with minnows 
sw2473B-ms98-a-0057 223.653375 227.397750 uh and we ta[ke]- we fish at Lake Texoma
sw2473B-ms98-a-0058 227.397750 235.274875 a[nd]- and then and then just kind of stop there on the way by and get the uh and and get the and get minnows and uh
sw2473B-ms98-a-0059 235.274875 242.652000 it's it's pretty lot of fun except i say you got to have a lot of patience because some days it doesn't seem like anything's down there at all
sw2473B-ms98-a-0060 242.652000 245.448500 and then o[ther]- other days uh
sw2473B-ms98-a-0061 245.448500 255.310500 uh you you can pull them_1 in with some degree of regularity it seems as the summer comes when it gets warm and you have calm days without a lot of wind they seem to be uh far more prevalent

sw2473B-ms98-a-0072 273.810000 282.377250 but you know at at Texoma it's such a big lake and we don't have a boat but we're on the dock and people come in there's a lot of sandy islands out in the middle of Texoma
sw2473B-ms98-a-0073 282.377250 291.471750 and they go out and fish around there and people come in with these ice chests just full of of you know twelve fourteen sixteen eighteen inch long fish
sw2473B-ms98-a-0074 291.471750 298.630250 it's the darndest thing i've ever seen and i don't know we we're probably going to have to get us a boat one of these days soon and go out and see go out and see what's really out there [laughter]

sw2473B-ms98-a-0076 300.149375 305.112750 oh yeah i know they are i used to have one that we used to ski ski behind
sw2473B-ms98-a-0077 305.112750 317.313625 and and before our our children came along my wife and i used to ski all the time then when the and we kept it on it was an eighteen footer it was kind of big to haul over the road so we kept it at a lake tied up
sw2473B-ms98-a-0078 317.313625 328.972750 and then when your children are very little you can't go out and do things like that and it got so the insurance and the and the uh and the tie up fee uh was [vocalized-noise]
sw2473B-ms98-a-0079 328.972750 332.099875 gigantic compared to what use we were getting out of it
sw2473B-ms98-a-0080 332.099875 342.506375 so i went and sold it and never bought again and it's too bad now the kids are teenagers they want they'd love to get out there and learn to [laughter-ski] and do the boating and and fishing again so we['ll]- probably do something like that 
sw2473B-ms98-a-0081 342.506375 344.544500 do you do you camp at the lake a lot
sw2473B-ms98-a-0082 344.544500 348.802875 [silence]

sw2473B-ms98-a-0130 519.771750 526.047750 what would it take about thirty hours or something like that thirty two thirty six
sw2473B-ms98-a-0131 526.047750 529.567875 okay so that would be two long semesters and a summer maybe huh

sw2473B-ms98-a-0134 532.593750 542.495625 oh sure sure we[ll]- i think i think uh uh the best thing to do is i- i got two Masters degrees but they both came years after my Bachelor's degree
sw2473B-ms98-a-0135 542.495625 546.335750 and if i had to do it all over again i would do what you're planning to do like continue 
sw2473B-ms98-a-0136 546.335750 548.618250 you need to get it while you're still hot [laughter]
sw2473B-ms98-a-0137 548.618250 551.962250 [laughter]
sw2473B-ms98-a-0138 551.962250 555.213500 i[t]- it is it is very hard to go back and
sw2473B-ms98-a-0139 555.213500 567.996375 and actually the academic part isn't bad when your when you resume because it seems that things come easier because you're more mature and you've got all your life experiences and i thought the academic part would be harder but it really isn't
sw2473B-ms98-a-0140 567.996375 576.641000 uh be[cause]- uh it because uh uh i don't know i think the maturity factor uh uh overcomes the fact that you've had a gap
sw2473B-ms98-a-0141 576.641000 585.798500 but nevertheless it's it's so much it's so hard to get back to it and it's it's so much easier while you've got your academic juices flowing
