sw2458B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 61.885125 [silence]
sw2458B-ms98-a-0002 61.885125 68.572750 well you know i- i think fireplaces are great but you know you really don't have to have wood
sw2458B-ms98-a-0003 68.572750 81.747500 you know i mean fireplaces their great but you can get you know one hundred percent clean burning natural gas in your fireplaces and i mean you know most of the fireplaces are for ambience anyway they're not that efficient
sw2458B-ms98-a-0004 81.747500 89.540375 there they they really are but but uh i live in a place where cars 
sw2458B-ms98-a-0005 89.540375 98.944000 are are i mean [vocalized-noise] you see a picture of the freeway here in the Bay area and you know at anyone given time you'll see you know 
sw2458B-ms98-a-0006 98.944000 104.868625 maybe four out of a hundred will have more than one person in the car
sw2458B-ms98-a-0007 104.868625 116.047000 so i'm i'm a real proponent for mass transit there's there's just uh uh you know there's just no reason on a regular basis for someone having
sw2458B-ms98-a-0008 116.047000 124.617500 you know to uh i[f]- if if we just did our mass transit better and longer and more complete you know
sw2458B-ms98-a-0009 124.617500 132.749375 around the Bay area here we got uh uh system here called i don't know if you've ever been to the Bay area uh it's called uh
sw2458B-ms98-a-0010 132.749375 139.040750 BART Bay Area Rapid Transit and they uh um
sw2458B-ms98-a-0011 139.040750 145.617375 uh connect Berkeley with San Francisco with Oakland and and
sw2458B-ms98-a-0012 145.617375 159.362875 a couple of other cities but if it were to go to co[mplete]- completely around the Bay and when you ever you get on BART BART's just absolutely wonderful because it's fast it's clean it's really efficient and it's it's actually fun to ride
sw2458B-ms98-a-0013 159.362875 169.128875 but uh it's just you you know [vocalized-noise] its its been half assed and uh they need to completely uh you know 
sw2458B-ms98-a-0014 169.128875 177.264125 make the system so it goes completely throughout the the Bay area a lot of people w[ould]- ride BART but a lot more would
sw2458B-ms98-a-0015 177.264125 189.212750 if uh and i think you know that alone that alone would just cut down so immensely on that we've we've also i mean the fact of the matter is is that you know they've just got to find other fuels 
sw2458B-ms98-a-0016 189.212750 198.059375 and and and and go other routes our our our i think basically our air pollution is one of the one of the 
sw2458B-ms98-a-0017 198.059375 199.832625 uh
sw2458B-ms98-a-0018 199.832625 201.826875 oh
sw2458B-ms98-a-0019 201.826875 214.858000 one of main side effects uh or or or or you know one of those visible symptoms of the US energy policy period and our energy policy is just nil just is nonexistent
sw2458B-ms98-a-0020 214.858000 217.081250 and uh if we had one
sw2458B-ms98-a-0021 217.081250 231.129375 uh you know striving to meet certain standards and certain goals and really to push it and uh let the corporations and the yeah you know the the automobile manufactures and stuff it it it just keeps sliding 
sw2458B-ms98-a-0022 231.129375 238.207500 i- i think it would make a big big difference it's just it you know it just hasn't hit people yet that we may have crossed the line
sw2458B-ms98-a-0023 238.207500 252.640375 and that line being of of uh you know a a a a planet that's going to be able to continue to live or it's gradually already dying and it will not be renewable i mean we may have crossed that line
sw2458B-ms98-a-0024 252.640375 258.137000 and it will be up to our kids and maybe their kids to you know
sw2458B-ms98-a-0025 258.137000 259.826125 to find out
sw2458B-ms98-a-0026 259.826125 264.478750 and things will live on this planet but humans may not be able to anymore
sw2458B-ms98-a-0027 264.478750 271.725500 [silence]
sw2458B-ms98-a-0028 271.725500 273.121000 uh

sw2458B-ms98-a-0030 319.309375 323.144750 oh that that that's terrible i mean that really is you know
sw2458B-ms98-a-0031 323.144750 324.696875 [silence]
sw2458B-ms98-a-0032 324.696875 326.274875 yeah
sw2458B-ms98-a-0033 326.274875 333.848625 [silence]
sw2458B-ms98-a-0034 333.848625 335.123750 yeah

sw2458B-ms98-a-0036 338.372875 339.946000 sure
sw2458B-ms98-a-0037 339.946000 348.609750 [silence]
sw2458B-ms98-a-0038 348.609750 349.859750 yep
sw2458B-ms98-a-0039 349.859750 367.934125 [silence]
sw2458B-ms98-a-0040 367.934125 382.480250 well i mean it it it is a fact uh the the CFC's do act like i mean it it it's it's like a billiard ball you get a CFC up there high enough you know it's a it's in the ozone layer
sw2458B-ms98-a-0041 382.480250 397.200375 it doesn't just breakdown one it's not a one to one reaction it's it's a catalytic thing and it it actually just rumbles around and around and and breaks up every C O you know O O O three molecule it hits
sw2458B-ms98-a-0042 397.200375 399.990125 and uh i mean
sw2458B-ms98-a-0043 399.990125 412.423125 whether whether it is the main contributor or not it's uh you know i- i think that no one can doubt the fact that it is 
sw2458B-ms98-a-0044 412.423125 415.622125 you know i mean i[t's]- it's a bad thing
sw2458B-ms98-a-0045 415.622125 429.714750 it's a real bad thing and it's just you know i think it's so many of these bad things and some little really don't contribute that much and some just insignificantly but uh you know i- i heard something the other night that absolutely floored me 
sw2458B-ms98-a-0046 429.714750 443.999875 i'm a i'm a i'm a space enthusiast and just absolutely uh am absolutely crazy about the s[olar]- you know and think that we ought to put as much money as we can possibly get into the to the space program and i found out the other night
sw2458B-ms98-a-0047 443.999875 450.753125 from an Australian scientist one of the most respected uh scientist in Australia
sw2458B-ms98-a-0048 450.753125 453.019500 that every time
sw2458B-ms98-a-0049 453.019500 456.316500 i the US shuttle goes up
sw2458B-ms98-a-0050 456.316500 469.907000 it dumps more than what is it a hundred tons of these fluorocarbons into the ozone layer it is probably responsible our US shuttle
sw2458B-ms98-a-0051 469.907000 475.227875 breaking down the ozone layer each flight could bring it down as much as one tenth
sw2458B-ms98-a-0052 475.227875 476.388375 [silence]
sw2458B-ms98-a-0053 476.388375 479.507750 and it's the solid rocket propellants
sw2458B-ms98-a-0054 479.507750 481.477750 parts of the system
sw2458B-ms98-a-0055 481.477750 486.802625 if if it were to be jettisoned lower you know before it got up that high
sw2458B-ms98-a-0056 486.802625 500.398625 uh it it it it it really wouldn't have that great of effect but what happens is it goes all the way up through into the ozone layer and then it keeps firing and dumping and i just blew me away
sw2458B-ms98-a-0057 500.398625 502.138250 [silence]
sw2458B-ms98-a-0058 502.138250 513.840125 yeah uh and it's frightening and and and a couple of these scientist down there have been screaming about this for some time now and of course uh Australia is the one that's going to
sw2458B-ms98-a-0059 513.840125 519.996625 you know suffer the most because uh that main whole that's over
sw2458B-ms98-a-0060 519.996625 530.426250 the uh Antarctica conti[nent]- continent you know uh it it expands out over Australia and at certain times of the year
sw2458B-ms98-a-0061 530.426250 543.001375 you know there's absolutely no ozone protection whatsoever in Australia in the last in the years of the shuttle the uh uh the skin cancer and and other you know uh
sw2458B-ms98-a-0062 543.001375 549.156625 cancers in Australia have gone up you know something like like six thousand percent
sw2458B-ms98-a-0063 549.156625 554.447500 [silence]
sw2458B-ms98-a-0064 554.447500 561.222125 yeah they're they're they're so they're they're a little bit cross with the US and we could remodel that system you know
sw2458B-ms98-a-0065 561.222125 575.245000 we don't have to use those as a matter of fact it wasn't designed that way initially at all the solid uh propellant rockets were a uh you know were time saving money saving afterthought
sw2458B-ms98-a-0066 575.245000 581.793500 uh and uh i just you know i think it's just been uh uh uh
sw2458B-ms98-a-0067 581.793500 590.113000 terrible anyway anyway but that th[at]- th[at]- th[at]- th[at]- th[at]- as an aside but there's another one of those things you know it's like so many of these little things
sw2458B-ms98-a-0068 590.113000 597.059625 th[at]- th[at]- that add to it that i- i just think this country not only this country but the world has kind of started thinking
sw2458B-ms98-a-0069 597.059625 599.782625 that uh if we don't get it together here
