sw2458A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 4.678375 hell air pollution tends to be a a topic that uh
sw2458A-ms98-a-0002 4.678375 16.023625 some people have a lot to say on and some don't care much for it at all but uh i found that there's there seems to be quite a bit that the individual can do as far as air pollution and one thing
sw2458A-ms98-a-0003 16.023625 28.911375 it kind of hits the old pocketbook a little bit but if you can just keep the automotives vehicles going properly instead of uh letting them_1 rundown and use a quart a oil a mile like some of these smoke cars do
sw2458A-ms98-a-0004 28.911375 39.960750 that would uh make quite a difference we all seem to have one or more of those things and then we have a variety of people at least in this part of country that uh love their fireplaces
sw2458A-ms98-a-0005 39.960750 45.625625 and we burn off an awful lot of uh acreage of wood and put it up in smoke and on a
sw2458A-ms98-a-0006 45.625625 56.210375 proper day as far as the temperature goes you can have a cloud of smoke hovering other a neighborhood that's just sickening really i mean it may be pleasant inside but it stinks outside
sw2458A-ms98-a-0007 56.210375 62.995500 so uh little things like that uh an individual can do what what else do you think they can do

sw2458A-ms98-a-0037 263.005125 273.851000 [laughter-right] it may not be us yeah we have a um they happen to use about the same abbreviation for the Dallas area they use Dallas Area Rapid Transit for DART and uh
sw2458A-ms98-a-0038 273.851000 284.188750 DART's problem he[re]- the you know the Metroplex itself suburbs and all i[t]- it's a pretty hefty uh distance from one suburb to the southern suburb so they they run uh
sw2458A-ms98-a-0039 284.188750 294.284750 they gather the monies from the other counties and the other suburbs and and run the DART system throughout the suburbs to downtown Dallas as it were and it's a good
sw2458A-ms98-a-0040 294.284750 305.932500 forty or so miles in each direction just about and they also try to run city to city with you know around locally the only problem is for me to go to work i live um
sw2458A-ms98-a-0041 305.932500 307.184625 [silence]
sw2458A-ms98-a-0042 307.184625 314.620875 less than ten miles from the front door of my my uh place of work and for me to get there
sw2458A-ms98-a-0043 314.620875 325.033000 it would take me an hour and a half of three different bus transfers and that's just ridiculous can't get there from here [laughter] and it's a large place i mean we're talking about
sw2458A-ms98-a-0044 325.033000 334.402250 Texas Instruments thirty thousand people in the whole area right and then my building inside it's fairly large and there's no reason for me to have to go from point A to point B in an hour and a half
sw2458A-ms98-a-0045 334.402250 338.740875 when i can roll that old beast of mine down there for a lot less than that
sw2458A-ms98-a-0046 338.740875 344.899500 plus it would cost me oh i think the last time i looked at it was about had a dollar fifty one way
sw2458A-ms98-a-0047 344.899500 349.557250 and i said no i'm not going to do that fast isn't that bad yet
sw2458A-ms98-a-0048 349.557250 357.950000 so that part's one problem i- i wonder about the whole CFC issue i've i've read some papers from some
sw2458A-ms98-a-0049 357.950000 369.159000 some scientist that don't get published that well because of their opposition to that saying that they're really not sure that the CFC's are the main problem yes we have a ozone problem but is it
