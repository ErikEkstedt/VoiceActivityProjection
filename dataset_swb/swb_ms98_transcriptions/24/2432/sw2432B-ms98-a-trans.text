sw2432B-ms98-a-0035 135.035625 143.574875 so a little different and i wanted to do this thing that you can get through Target to recycle i had my school do it
sw2432B-ms98-a-0036 143.574875 153.463000 but my principal said since we're doing this thing called Operation Desert Shield we're sending letters to all these servicemen and making video tapes and all [laughter-this]

sw2432B-ms98-a-0110 434.821750 442.486375 oh definitely there's no wh[at]- let's see we've had the funding we've run out of money we've frozen the money
sw2432B-ms98-a-0111 442.486375 456.133875 right and they had until the fifteenth of April to come up some formula that would be more equitable to dis[tricts]- different districts according to finances because_1 the poor districts were getting less money so
sw2432B-ms98-a-0112 456.133875 459.024000 not as good an education right
sw2432B-ms98-a-0113 459.024000 468.112000 and now they're trying to take some money away from the richer districts like the one that i'm in in Dallas and make us pay our money to the smaller ones and make it more equitable
sw2432B-ms98-a-0114 468.112000 473.698500 and if they can't come up with something by the fifteenth then the state's supposed to decide the courts

sw2432B-ms98-a-0125 503.339875 505.320875 we have too many administrators
sw2432B-ms98-a-0126 505.320875 511.314250 in some of these big districts but other than that well can you think of anything else we need to talk about
