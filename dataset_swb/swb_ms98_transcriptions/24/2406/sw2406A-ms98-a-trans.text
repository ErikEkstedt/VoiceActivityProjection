sw2406A-ms98-a-0008 71.807500 75.999625 even better than Roger Rabbit insofar as animation
sw2406A-ms98-a-0009 75.999625 77.814875 [silence]

sw2406A-ms98-a-0012 85.784875 89.582250 yeah that was made in a few i don't know several years back i guess
sw2406A-ms98-a-0013 89.582250 93.320750 latest latest one i've saw which was a
sw2406A-ms98-a-0014 93.320750 98.211000 mistake to go see was Lionheart had Claude Van Damme
sw2406A-ms98-a-0015 98.211000 105.323500 he was he's of course uh i guess he's trained in this uh martial arts of some sort but
sw2406A-ms98-a-0016 105.323500 112.525875 the plot was bland the acting was bland It was just mostly centered upon his abilities to
sw2406A-ms98-a-0017 112.525875 115.696500 yeah chop them up exactly and
sw2406A-ms98-a-0018 115.696500 120.395625 [silence]
sw2406A-ms98-a-0019 120.395625 122.026125 yeah

sw2406A-ms98-a-0021 123.312000 131.332250 or he's singular i guess you know you know how they can make any of any single one of them in a movie to be a super
sw2406A-ms98-a-0022 131.332250 132.373500 [silence]
sw2406A-ms98-a-0023 132.373500 138.311250 superstar of any sort you know but Chuck Norris of course could be just about equal if not more
sw2406A-ms98-a-0024 138.311250 140.599250 and all of them i guess could be in that fashion
sw2406A-ms98-a-0025 140.599250 142.138125 or category
sw2406A-ms98-a-0026 142.138125 144.213625 [silence]
sw2406A-ms98-a-0027 144.213625 146.450375 it was about uh
sw2406A-ms98-a-0028 146.450375 149.060750 a French Foreign Legion fellow
sw2406A-ms98-a-0029 149.060750 154.075750 who deserts to go help his brother's wife
sw2406A-ms98-a-0030 154.075750 158.349875 who got who became a widow because he was selling drugs
sw2406A-ms98-a-0031 158.349875 160.103375 [laughter]
sw2406A-ms98-a-0032 160.103375 161.755875 and he got killed
sw2406A-ms98-a-0033 161.755875 163.559875 [silence]
sw2406A-ms98-a-0034 163.559875 168.554375 so he deserts and goes to New York and he starts out by fighting to make money
sw2406A-ms98-a-0035 168.554375 171.992000 and then he moves on to L A to where that where she is
sw2406A-ms98-a-0036 171.992000 173.860500 to just help him out
sw2406A-ms98-a-0037 173.860500 174.957375 [silence]
sw2406A-ms98-a-0038 174.957375 180.939000 it was really i mean the Hollywood really must think there's some real dummies out there or something i don't know
sw2406A-ms98-a-0039 180.939000 182.006250 [laughter]
sw2406A-ms98-a-0040 182.006250 190.316000 [silence]

sw2406A-ms98-a-0047 214.864375 219.563000 i i absorbed all of that movie in one sitting uh
sw2406A-ms98-a-0048 219.563000 224.287125 i guess what made it so good was the cinema[tography]- cinematography
sw2406A-ms98-a-0049 224.287125 225.728125 [silence]
sw2406A-ms98-a-0050 225.728125 232.301500 yeah and the music and uh well it had an excellent story line Everything about it was good
sw2406A-ms98-a-0051 232.301500 236.444750 um i thought an excellent one too was misery
sw2406A-ms98-a-0052 236.444750 242.557625 with Kathy Bates and James Caan i'm not a James Caan fan but
sw2406A-ms98-a-0053 242.557625 247.076750 that was a well directed and acted movie
sw2406A-ms98-a-0054 247.076750 250.694375 i'd recommend it It's a little on the violent side
sw2406A-ms98-a-0055 250.694375 253.182000 but then what movie isn't anymore
sw2406A-ms98-a-0056 253.182000 265.957500 [silence]
