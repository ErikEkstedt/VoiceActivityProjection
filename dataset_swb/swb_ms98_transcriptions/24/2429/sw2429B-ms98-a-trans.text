sw2429B-ms98-a-0057 283.371500 297.478125 ethnic food or um sometimes it would be um oh oh i don't know maybe an outdoor theme or uh uh elegant theme or you know [laughter] it was a lot of fun

sw2429B-ms98-a-0062 308.782375 319.521875 make us dinner one time uh just to even it out since we seemed to be unfairly doing all the cooking and they were doing all the enjoying i'm

sw2429B-ms98-a-0079 401.110875 412.634875 yeah it's um it's in the other room i don't know if we have enough time for it it's real easy one of the unique things in this [vocalized-noise] like a pound of ground beef some bread crumbs um an egg um
sw2429B-ms98-a-0080 412.634875 419.001875 um what ever seasoning usually just light seasonings like salt and pepper um and chopped up water chestnuts [noise]
sw2429B-ms98-a-0081 419.001875 427.923750 which is something different um makes them a little bit crunchy you need to chop them_1 up real fine but um it makes them crunchy and that adds something new to it
sw2429B-ms98-a-0082 427.923750 440.106125 and then the sauce is just made with um bouillon cubes water burgundy wine and um cornstarch instead of flour
sw2429B-ms98-a-0083 440.106125 451.654875 so it's not a it's not a thick rich type of a sauce it's more of a when you use corn starch in in gravy like you know when you have um Chinese food
sw2429B-ms98-a-0084 451.654875 462.837625 the kind of a gravy or a sauce that comes with a lot of that they use corn starch instead of flour in all of their sauces and gravies and it gives it a bit of a different consistency
sw2429B-ms98-a-0085 462.837625 465.433375 [silence]
sw2429B-ms98-a-0086 465.433375 472.158000 the meatballs you just um after you form them fry them in a pan until they're
sw2429B-ms98-a-0087 472.158000 481.971875 uh browned on all all sides and then drain off all the grease uh then what i usually do is i freeze them and then when you're ready to serve them
sw2429B-ms98-a-0088 481.971875 489.406875 then you cook the sauce and then put the meatballs into the sauce and heat it probably you have to heat it up for a good
sw2429B-ms98-a-0089 489.406875 499.393875 oh if they're frozen you know it may take a half hour for them to thaw out but then heat them thoroughly in the sauce itself let them simmer in the sauce itself
