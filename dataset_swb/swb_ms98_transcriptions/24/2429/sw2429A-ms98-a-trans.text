sw2429A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.265750 [silence]
sw2429A-ms98-a-0002 1.265750 3.918750 well what would you have at a dinner party
sw2429A-ms98-a-0003 3.918750 9.605125 [silence]
sw2429A-ms98-a-0004 9.605125 11.435250 uh-huh [noise]
sw2429A-ms98-a-0005 11.435250 24.273500 [silence]
sw2429A-ms98-a-0006 24.273500 27.991375 oh gosh that sounds great
sw2429A-ms98-a-0007 27.991375 32.966375 [silence]
sw2429A-ms98-a-0008 32.966375 34.847625 uh-huh
sw2429A-ms98-a-0009 34.847625 36.095750 [silence]
sw2429A-ms98-a-0010 36.095750 45.907250 well um i think it would probably depend on whether this was a formal or informal dinner party but if it was informal my first choice would be crawfish
sw2429A-ms98-a-0011 45.907250 48.877125 [silence]
sw2429A-ms98-a-0012 48.877125 56.459875 because i mean crawfish everybody over here likes crawfish but you know i i wouldn't have to worry about satisfying my
sw2429A-ms98-a-0013 56.459875 66.087000 guest but if it was a formal uh dinner party i would probably think of something else like um [shrip/shrimp] shrimp fettucini is real easy
sw2429A-ms98-a-0014 66.087000 74.460500 to um make and everything and it's usually well liked by people i guess i'm just a seafood fan so i think on the lines
sw2429A-ms98-a-0015 74.460500 86.169625 [silence]
sw2429A-ms98-a-0016 86.169625 90.439000 oh yeah um you're not supposed to i mean you're not supposed to eat them_1
sw2429A-ms98-a-0017 90.439000 105.420625 dead i mean well you eat them_1 dead but [laughter] right because_1 if if they're dead for too long you can always tell whenever they're cooked if they've been dead for a long time because_1 their tail straightens out and you're not supposed to eat those because_1 they're the bad for you
sw2429A-ms98-a-0018 105.420625 119.816375 yeah so if you ever go in a restaurant and order crawfish i mean every once in a while you'll see o[ne]- i mean it doesn't happen very often because it's just an accident but if the tail is straight on it then yeah don't eat it but um you just put some cajun well
sw2429A-ms98-a-0019 119.816375 133.543250 lots of pepper and you just boil them and they're absolutely wonderful but there's uh they're a pain to peel for some people once you get used to it they're real easy but um you know if you have nails or anything you can
sw2429A-ms98-a-0020 133.543250 135.387500 plan on those being shot
sw2429A-ms98-a-0021 135.387500 140.654750 [silence]
sw2429A-ms98-a-0022 140.654750 146.560375 i think for a dinner party i i don't know it depends like if like
sw2429A-ms98-a-0023 146.560375 159.647375 my age if there was a bunch of college kids coming over for a dinner party no i they would shell their own you know we'd just have crawfish and beer or something but um if it was more formal like if i was you know working environment then i would probably um sh[ell]-
sw2429A-ms98-a-0024 159.647375 170.154125 shell them_1 or at least disconnect them from the head but there's a there's a big thing over here that everybody sucks the head so um
sw2429A-ms98-a-0025 170.154125 177.095125 it it would just depend that's the best part of the crawfish sucking the head but um
sw2429A-ms98-a-0026 177.095125 185.799875 i don't know it just i[t]- it just depended on what type it was i guess but you can buy uh the crawfish tails already peeled an[d]- everything and
sw2429A-ms98-a-0027 185.799875 192.525375 usually you use those like for frying or to put in salads or to um
sw2429A-ms98-a-0028 192.525375 200.798125 you know make a sauce with or something like that but you can go ahead and buy them_1 cooked and shelled and they're more expensive of course but
sw2429A-ms98-a-0029 200.798125 206.848500 um [noise] yeah it really does i like shrimp better
sw2429A-ms98-a-0030 206.848500 216.742125 just um but crawfish i mean it just has a taste of its own it also depends on who's cooking it and how much seasoning they use and stuff like that but um
sw2429A-ms98-a-0031 216.742125 227.936125 i think that and also to get totally off c[rawfish]- the subject of crawfish lots of vegetables and hors d'oeuvres and stuff like that for a dinner party i think that that really helps
sw2429A-ms98-a-0032 227.936125 233.644250 [silence]
sw2429A-ms98-a-0033 233.644250 240.131625 [laughter] that's what i need [laughter]
