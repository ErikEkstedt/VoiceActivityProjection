sw2438A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 9.107250 exercise tends to be a a topic that i guess i've never developed any will power to maintain any regular program i uh
sw2438A-ms98-a-0002 9.107250 10.113375 [silence]
sw2438A-ms98-a-0003 10.113375 21.794000 oh i guess all the factors that drive one to do that are appearance or general health or some some uh need for reduction of weight or whatever
sw2438A-ms98-a-0004 21.794000 27.189875 and i haven't uh been cursed or blessed with either depending on the way you look at it
sw2438A-ms98-a-0005 27.189875 34.550000 um i've always been a physique that can stay skinny no matter what i eat or how much i eat or if i
sw2438A-ms98-a-0006 34.550000 39.923250 uh exercise or not and they tell me that's going to catch up with me someday uh
sw2438A-ms98-a-0007 39.923250 46.164750 [silence]
sw2438A-ms98-a-0008 46.164750 52.776375 well maybe that'll maybe that'll allow me to to outweigh some of the things i have to pick up on occasion [laughter]
sw2438A-ms98-a-0009 52.776375 62.166500 when uh i got married i was working a summer in college in construction and lost lot of what little weight i had
sw2438A-ms98-a-0010 62.166500 70.255500 i got married at a hundred and thirty pounds and twenty years old and i was just this little toothpick up there had to buy a new suit for it just to fit in there
sw2438A-ms98-a-0011 70.255500 80.652375 and it took me a good ten years to put on some weight and any exercise even when summer would come and i'd mow the lawn i'd lose five to seven pounds just just as soon as the heat kicked in
sw2438A-ms98-a-0012 80.652375 89.370375 and finally at around age thirty i i managed to keep some weight and not lose so much during the summer and i hover at a hundred fifty and i'm six one so
sw2438A-ms98-a-0013 89.370375 99.022375 it's not too bad i[t]- it it's unfortunate though i guess because i probably should uh do a little less of the hardening of the arteries with the salt and a little less of the sugar here and there but
sw2438A-ms98-a-0014 99.022375 100.759875 [noise]
sw2438A-ms98-a-0015 100.759875 103.646500 [silence]
sw2438A-ms98-a-0016 103.646500 110.191750 yeah a lot a lot of people uh my brother in laws are all everybody is bigger than me for the most part
sw2438A-ms98-a-0017 110.191750 119.876500 but uh it's kind of nice it's uh i- i've noticed a little bit uh of uh love handles here and there and my face has filled out a little bit from the pictures but uh
sw2438A-ms98-a-0018 119.876500 123.268125 all that is is ever so slowly so
sw2438A-ms98-a-0019 123.268125 134.908250 but then my father's uh sixty five years old and he's he doesn't show any signs of having to cut back either so there's hope for me maybe [laughter-i'll] maybe i'll maintain that

sw2438A-ms98-a-0040 309.233000 311.801375 yeah well i've i've managed to
sw2438A-ms98-a-0041 311.801375 320.122375 i guess the work i do gives me a little bit of well a lot of walking and a little bit of uh lifting on occasion
sw2438A-ms98-a-0042 320.122375 323.499000 it's not all sitting behind a desk so that's kind of nice it uh
sw2438A-ms98-a-0043 323.499000 330.326000 [noise] i could sure tell the difference though after the first year or so of being there uh prior to
sw2438A-ms98-a-0044 330.326000 344.016625 to uh working a steady you know eight hour job as it were i had been working for a camp and had had rela[tively]- real long hour you know a sixteen years old and could handle getting up at five and not getting to bed until ten or eleven and
sw2438A-ms98-a-0045 344.016625 348.003500 virtually working or or playing myself to death all day
sw2438A-ms98-a-0046 348.003500 357.907375 and uh boy after a few years of sitting down and then going to that that camp as a camper this time i couldn't even do what i used to do [laughter]
sw2438A-ms98-a-0047 357.907375 366.378125 and it was really a a an eye opener for me to see that uh even sitting down for a little while sure changes the old body's uh capacity or
sw2438A-ms98-a-0048 366.378125 388.664750 [silence]
sw2438A-ms98-a-0049 388.664750 389.526750 um

sw2438A-ms98-a-0056 428.492125 433.250375 yeah my kids and i like to bicycle i tend to be rather sore the next day or two
sw2438A-ms98-a-0057 433.250375 437.935125 those uh ten speeds and their unforgiving seat that i sit on
sw2438A-ms98-a-0058 437.935125 447.964250 but uh they tend to like the parking lot up at the uh Springcreek Plant the upper limit of it's terraced and its usually unoccupied and
sw2438A-ms98-a-0059 447.964250 453.615250 boy you can just you go down hill down hill down hill then turn around and work your way back up and uh
sw2438A-ms98-a-0060 453.615250 459.208875 it's fun for them we take the long route go up Alma and across the back way come in the parking lot and
sw2438A-ms98-a-0061 459.208875 461.509750 it takes a couple of hours off the day
sw2438A-ms98-a-0062 461.509750 473.204625 but uh after all that and i usually end up having to by the end of the day they're usually tired enough where one of them or the other needs a little push along the way and i'm sitting here trying to go my bike and push them too and
sw2438A-ms98-a-0063 473.204625 477.617250 and uh it gets to the old leg muscles but
sw2438A-ms98-a-0064 477.617250 480.806000 can't do too much of that or i'll waste away
sw2438A-ms98-a-0065 480.806000 482.417125 [silence]
sw2438A-ms98-a-0066 482.417125 491.063000 i sat down to uh one of the the nurses did the um [vocalized-noise] oh they do that blood deal oh 
sw2438A-ms98-a-0067 491.063000 495.757375 no it was just one of the what is that pulse no not the pulse they put on
sw2438A-ms98-a-0068 495.757375 499.729875 blood pressure yeah they sit there in the cafeteria sometimes and take that on your way out
sw2438A-ms98-a-0069 499.729875 509.078750 and after having sat for twenty or thirty minutes and i get up and walk over to that and sat down and they they took it it was pretty low like it usually is it it stays real
sw2438A-ms98-a-0070 509.078750 514.593750 i guess all the arteries are open and it doesn't have any trouble pumping it all through but uh
sw2438A-ms98-a-0071 514.593750 522.792375 the lady looked up at me and said oh you must be a jogger and i said oh if you only knew [laughter] couch potato with remote control
sw2438A-ms98-a-0072 522.792375 529.884625 uh so fortunately i don't know what the cholesterol level is but at least it hasn't clogged up yet
