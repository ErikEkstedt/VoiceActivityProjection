sw2496B-ms98-a-0085 367.941125 379.554750 uh yeah yeah there's one favorite place that we have called August Moon that's that's pretty good and uh i've got one thing on the menu that i really love but um we don't
sw2496B-ms98-a-0086 379.554750 389.081500 do that probably as often we used to do a a quick take out kind of place that wasn't real great Chinese but we used to do we just liked vegetable fried rice quite a bit
sw2496B-ms98-a-0087 389.081500 400.586875 just you know as a quick kind of dinner thing that's you know it's not real filling but you know get some veggies and rice and stuff every once in a while we go out to a little bit nicer Chinese place

sw2496B-ms98-a-0094 433.805875 446.042875 well recently we've both been trying to do some diet so we haven't gone out because when they tell you about how much fat is in all that food you know it really kind of crimps your style there but um
sw2496B-ms98-a-0095 446.042875 458.675250 we probably you know maybe go out like once a week on the weekend usually with friends or something we kind of go out um not always you know sometimes we cook the meal at home and have people in
sw2496B-ms98-a-0096 458.675250 466.906625 but i haven't really thought about you know the economy all that much and and eating out we we never really did it a lot but
sw2496B-ms98-a-0097 466.906625 472.120000 you know we do maybe go out a couple of times a month at least to eat out

sw2496B-ms98-a-0113 524.265125 534.548125 well though you know TI has laid off quite a few in this area and then General Dynamics has its woes too so that it seems like there's been
sw2496B-ms98-a-0114 534.548125 541.184500 a lot of people recently you know when big companies uh change their programs and and such that
sw2496B-ms98-a-0115 541.184500 549.844625 there's been an influx of some unemployed but probably when you spread it out over everybody in Dallas it maybe has not changed the percentage all that much
sw2496B-ms98-a-0116 549.844625 553.895875 you know maybe one or two percent possibly it's hard to say
sw2496B-ms98-a-0117 553.895875 567.056500 it just seems like a lot when you hear about companies that keep continually advertising or stating that they're you know you know cutting out so many thousands of employees it sounds like big numbers of people out there

sw2496B-ms98-a-0121 580.336250 591.583125 i think the people down here must shop for entertainment because we have more shopping malls within close proximity [laughter-i] [laughter-mean] it's like we could have shopping malls even across the road from each other 
sw2496B-ms98-a-0122 591.583125 600.549000 there must be a lot of people with a lot of money who just like to go out and shop because we have plentitude of shopping malls within like a five mile radius i
