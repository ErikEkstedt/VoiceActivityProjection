sw2496A-ms98-a-0005 34.590000 40.260000 is that that's because you're you're natives there and that's what you're used to you you've grown up that way
sw2496A-ms98-a-0006 40.260000 66.046500 [silence]
sw2496A-ms98-a-0007 66.046500 68.317500 yeah right
sw2496A-ms98-a-0008 68.317500 71.267375 yeah we've got a place down at Providence that's
sw2496A-ms98-a-0009 71.267375 73.144875 that's called Federal Hill and 
sw2496A-ms98-a-0010 73.144875 75.850125 it's all the old old Italians 
sw2496A-ms98-a-0011 75.850125 77.210875 and
sw2496A-ms98-a-0012 77.210875 81.695375 they've got some real nice restaurants down there but what
sw2496A-ms98-a-0013 81.695375 85.464750 we usually like to do is is go out and
sw2496A-ms98-a-0014 85.464750 88.493500 and have something that we normally don't have at home
sw2496A-ms98-a-0015 88.493500 95.510875 like you can have uh naturally we've got a lot of fish up here you know and shellfish and because we live right on the coast
sw2496A-ms98-a-0016 95.510875 102.436750 but that's readily available and we can usually have that at home or we usually throw a steak on our on the grill or something
sw2496A-ms98-a-0017 102.436750 111.550875 but when we go out to to eat we like to go to uh a better restaurant i like i like jacket and tie um 
sw2496A-ms98-a-0018 111.550875 115.136375 you know when you go out to dine it's we we kind of make a night of it 
sw2496A-ms98-a-0019 115.136375 117.589000 but we try to order something that
sw2496A-ms98-a-0020 117.589000 120.081250 [vocalized-noise] we don't usually 
sw2496A-ms98-a-0021 120.081250 122.477500 have around the house
sw2496A-ms98-a-0022 122.477500 125.108750 and as far as um
sw2496A-ms98-a-0023 125.108750 131.096500 Mexican type we've got the only thing up here that we have anywhere close to that is Taco Bell
sw2496A-ms98-a-0024 131.096500 133.547125 [laughter]
sw2496A-ms98-a-0025 133.547125 138.527125 [laughter] yeah that's what i say because uh i i just 
sw2496A-ms98-a-0026 138.527125 141.129250 last month i spent a week in Dallas
sw2496A-ms98-a-0027 141.129250 142.341500 yeah

sw2496A-ms98-a-0030 150.168875 155.234625 guys down there they they took me out to all of these places you know and it's it's really uh
sw2496A-ms98-a-0031 155.234625 164.943750 it's unique i think i don't know if it's psychological or not but i think the beef down there is out out of this world we j[ust]- we just don't get the quality up here like like you have 
sw2496A-ms98-a-0032 164.943750 168.402625 [silence]
sw2496A-ms98-a-0033 168.402625 172.668250 no we went to uh uh
sw2496A-ms98-a-0034 172.668250 175.910000 uh i s[tayed]- we stayed at the Park 
sw2496A-ms98-a-0035 175.910000 178.196625 Park Plaza Park Suites
sw2496A-ms98-a-0036 178.196625 179.225375 yeah

sw2496A-ms98-a-0038 185.926000 189.385625 [silence]
sw2496A-ms98-a-0039 189.385625 190.976750 can't really 
sw2496A-ms98-a-0040 190.976750 193.512250 tell you what part of the what part of
sw2496A-ms98-a-0041 193.512250 198.585125 the town it was in but it was it's supposedly known it was up by one of the colleges anyhow
sw2496A-ms98-a-0042 198.585125 199.858875 and
sw2496A-ms98-a-0043 199.858875 204.030750 that was in the middle of the week and it was it was you had to wait in line to get in
sw2496A-ms98-a-0044 204.030750 207.822750 like i said it was it was noted for you know it's food 
sw2496A-ms98-a-0045 207.822750 209.324375 [silence]
sw2496A-ms98-a-0046 209.324375 210.381125 Picci's
sw2496A-ms98-a-0047 210.381125 212.474500 [silence]
sw2496A-ms98-a-0048 212.474500 219.335625 and then uh oh no let's see i went someplace i can't remember the name of it some other place we went 
sw2496A-ms98-a-0049 219.335625 221.231500 [silence]
sw2496A-ms98-a-0050 221.231500 223.123250 but we went to one
sw2496A-ms98-a-0051 223.123250 226.401375 and they serve you i mean the hamburger was a pound of meat
sw2496A-ms98-a-0052 226.401375 231.399875 and the hamburger i know it was it was a huge loaf of bread i couldn't believe it
sw2496A-ms98-a-0053 231.399875 236.560125 [laughter] i thought if this is the size of a hamburger down here I'll order hamburger
sw2496A-ms98-a-0054 236.560125 244.385750 and then we went to some fast food places that you know during during lunch we went out to some of those and it was good it was um
sw2496A-ms98-a-0055 244.385750 250.931875 i like Mexican food i like the burritos and all that but i don't like the sp[ice]- the hot 
sw2496A-ms98-a-0056 250.931875 255.346125 i like it spicy but i don't like it i don't like it hot you know where you your
sw2496A-ms98-a-0057 255.346125 257.343500 roof of your head's blown off
sw2496A-ms98-a-0058 257.343500 269.453375 [silence]
sw2496A-ms98-a-0059 269.453375 271.319375 [laughter]
sw2496A-ms98-a-0060 271.319375 275.553375 [silence]
sw2496A-ms98-a-0061 275.553375 283.913625 right and and it doesn't make any difference either if you if you eat some of that stuff and you can drink a gallon and it doesn't seem to put out the fire but
sw2496A-ms98-a-0062 283.913625 285.160000 [silence]
sw2496A-ms98-a-0063 285.160000 287.211500 and some people like that
sw2496A-ms98-a-0064 287.211500 292.529125 me it it seems like i don't know how about you do you like the extremely hot
sw2496A-ms98-a-0065 292.529125 312.360750 [silence]
sw2496A-ms98-a-0066 312.360750 313.413625 uh
sw2496A-ms98-a-0067 313.413625 316.927000 [silence]
sw2496A-ms98-a-0068 316.927000 321.853375 yeah yeah that's incredible that and um
sw2496A-ms98-a-0069 321.853375 324.953750 i'm afraid to take the chance when i go down there
sw2496A-ms98-a-0070 324.953750 327.359500 to eat a meal like that
sw2496A-ms98-a-0071 327.359500 331.840875 because once you get it what are you going to do with it if if it if it's too hot 
sw2496A-ms98-a-0072 331.840875 333.817000 and i'm not sure if
sw2496A-ms98-a-0073 333.817000 335.002125 you know if
sw2496A-ms98-a-0074 335.002125 339.830250 when they cook down there if they automatically just do that they throw a couple of red peppers in it and
sw2496A-ms98-a-0075 339.830250 341.762125 you know in the sauce 
sw2496A-ms98-a-0076 341.762125 344.093625 because that's what they're used to
sw2496A-ms98-a-0077 344.093625 350.643250 and up here we're not really well some people are i guess up here i mean they'll eat fire
sw2496A-ms98-a-0078 350.643250 356.320000 but i'm just not i'm not i don't mind the spices i love garlic and all the rest of that but
sw2496A-ms98-a-0079 356.320000 358.750500 the hot stuff oh
sw2496A-ms98-a-0080 358.750500 360.377375 [silence]
sw2496A-ms98-a-0081 360.377375 365.907625 and that's all you mainly do then right Italians how about uh Chinese
sw2496A-ms98-a-0082 365.907625 369.011125 yeah you go out for Chinese at all
sw2496A-ms98-a-0083 369.011125 388.532000 [silence]
sw2496A-ms98-a-0084 388.532000 390.328875 oh yeah yeah
sw2496A-ms98-a-0085 390.328875 396.510125 [silence]
sw2496A-ms98-a-0086 396.510125 397.564625 yeah
sw2496A-ms98-a-0087 397.564625 401.008375 [silence]
sw2496A-ms98-a-0088 401.008375 406.900500 that's what we'll do we'll take some we'll take take out like sometimes on the weekend um like snacks
sw2496A-ms98-a-0089 406.900500 413.923625 you know like uh beef teriyaki or or chicken fingers or that type of thing uh egg rolls
sw2496A-ms98-a-0090 413.923625 417.704750 or fried rice because it's easier to get out than to make it
sw2496A-ms98-a-0091 417.704750 423.376750 uh we'll do that occasionally um do you go out as much now
sw2496A-ms98-a-0092 423.376750 424.861125 as uh
sw2496A-ms98-a-0093 424.861125 426.597500 because the economy being
sw2496A-ms98-a-0094 426.597500 428.026250 such has that
sw2496A-ms98-a-0095 428.026250 431.772875 put a damper on you or does it make any difference
sw2496A-ms98-a-0096 431.772875 437.921250 [silence]
sw2496A-ms98-a-0097 437.921250 440.012250 [laughter]
sw2496A-ms98-a-0098 440.012250 458.435375 [silence]
sw2496A-ms98-a-0099 458.435375 460.127500 oh yeah
sw2496A-ms98-a-0100 460.127500 470.938125 [silence]
sw2496A-ms98-a-0101 470.938125 475.534875 yeah you know up here it's it's the restaurant business has fallen off
sw2496A-ms98-a-0102 475.534875 479.763750 uh pretty substantially because the the unemployment rate is pretty high
sw2496A-ms98-a-0103 479.763750 481.226875 it's uh
sw2496A-ms98-a-0104 481.226875 484.286000 in Massachusetts it's almost ten percent now
sw2496A-ms98-a-0105 484.286000 485.422000 [silence]
sw2496A-ms98-a-0106 485.422000 492.733500 so people don't have the discretionary incomes that they had you know overtime has been cut back a lot in certain areas
sw2496A-ms98-a-0107 492.733500 500.778625 but us i mean we still we live more or less like you and our kids are grown up and they're gone so it's just the two of us and uh
sw2496A-ms98-a-0108 500.778625 510.447125 we tend to go out maybe once a week maybe once every other week something like that but we'll we'll go out for uh
sw2496A-ms98-a-0109 510.447125 512.243750 uh take out
sw2496A-ms98-a-0110 512.243750 514.103625 and bring it home
sw2496A-ms98-a-0111 514.103625 518.593125 um but it hasn't it hasn't it uh it hasn't stopped us yet
sw2496A-ms98-a-0112 518.593125 524.364000 and i was just wondering down there it hasn't done anything to you either so your economy is a little bit better though i think down there now
sw2496A-ms98-a-0113 524.364000 525.583875 well
sw2496A-ms98-a-0114 525.583875 533.034125 [silence]
sw2496A-ms98-a-0115 533.034125 535.395375 oh okay so there's
sw2496A-ms98-a-0116 535.395375 550.736875 [silence]
sw2496A-ms98-a-0117 550.736875 551.898000 yeah
sw2496A-ms98-a-0118 551.898000 553.710000 [silence]
sw2496A-ms98-a-0119 553.710000 554.783125 yeah
sw2496A-ms98-a-0120 554.783125 564.776000 [silence]
sw2496A-ms98-a-0121 564.776000 565.975125 right
sw2496A-ms98-a-0122 565.975125 567.613750 [silence]
sw2496A-ms98-a-0123 567.613750 568.573000 yeah
sw2496A-ms98-a-0124 568.573000 569.650125 [silence]
sw2496A-ms98-a-0125 569.650125 573.475500 and it depends on life styles too down there i'm not sure if if 
sw2496A-ms98-a-0126 573.475500 574.479500 [silence]
sw2496A-ms98-a-0127 574.479500 580.089750 you all tend to go out more down there than we do up here or or if we tend to go out more
sw2496A-ms98-a-0128 580.089750 600.549000 [silence]
