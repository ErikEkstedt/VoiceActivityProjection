sw2448A-ms98-a-0002 0.514250 7.929500 okay Charles uh gun control what are you uh for in favor or no comment
sw2448A-ms98-a-0003 7.929500 9.388625 [silence]
sw2448A-ms98-a-0004 9.388625 10.989000 oh you are
sw2448A-ms98-a-0005 10.989000 14.104500 well this should be very interesting because_1 i'm against it
sw2448A-ms98-a-0006 14.104500 21.224750 [silence]
sw2448A-ms98-a-0007 21.224750 29.976000 well you know uh now he[re]- here's something that uh first occurred to me when they started having all these problems with these automatic uh weapons 
sw2448A-ms98-a-0008 29.976000 37.229250 uh now there always has been a federal law against fully automatic weapons
sw2448A-ms98-a-0009 37.229250 47.466500 [noise] and yet their uh the gun control enthusiasts are are uh preaching about the gun control and how they should be ha[ve]- we should have stronger laws and what not
sw2448A-ms98-a-0010 47.466500 52.993000 i don't understand why we don't enforce the laws we have
sw2448A-ms98-a-0011 52.993000 54.702250 [silence]
sw2448A-ms98-a-0012 54.702250 60.631750 now this is not just a state law this is a federal law controlled by the Treasury Department
sw2448A-ms98-a-0013 60.631750 68.102750 uh for fully automatic weapons and uh all right now for instance in California where they passed the uh [noise]
sw2448A-ms98-a-0014 68.102750 73.561250 uh semi automatic or or uh now what was it they called them 
sw2448A-ms98-a-0015 73.561250 77.774875 the military version attack weapons or something
sw2448A-ms98-a-0016 77.774875 79.344500 uh
sw2448A-ms98-a-0017 79.344500 87.971500 h[ow]- how is that going to affect the uh sports weapons i mean rifles that are automatic or semi automatic 
sw2448A-ms98-a-0018 87.971500 99.544250 [silence]
sw2448A-ms98-a-0019 99.544250 105.045000 uh-huh well now uh i've got to admit i'm inclined to agree with you there
sw2448A-ms98-a-0020 105.045000 116.377875 uh even though i am a member of the NRA and they are again[st]- they their reason being that well if you let one little law get through pretty soon one's going to stack up on top of another and so forth and so on
sw2448A-ms98-a-0021 116.377875 121.226250 and you've got to admit that Congress does kind of look at things that way
sw2448A-ms98-a-0022 121.226250 131.978625 [silence]
sw2448A-ms98-a-0023 131.978625 139.206750 uh that that's true uh now did you hear about the the control that they have up in Virginia
sw2448A-ms98-a-0024 139.206750 140.217000 [silence]
sw2448A-ms98-a-0025 140.217000 144.507875 uh it it's it's a little hard to believe but they can uh
sw2448A-ms98-a-0026 144.507875 153.770375 of course like just like just about every other state in the union they have a felony law anyone ever convicted of a a felony is cannot purchase a weapon
sw2448A-ms98-a-0027 153.770375 157.749500 and they don't have a waiting period
sw2448A-ms98-a-0028 157.749500 162.354375 because they have access to computer records
sw2448A-ms98-a-0029 162.354375 170.730375 concerning all these felons and the uh when you go in and buy a weapon or a handgun in uh uh Virginia
sw2448A-ms98-a-0030 170.730375 177.836750 the salesman just calls some number and uh punches in your name
sw2448A-ms98-a-0031 177.836750 183.944875 and if it comes up negative okay fine and you get your gu[n]- your gun right then and there
sw2448A-ms98-a-0032 183.944875 187.133625 uh but they are the only state that does it
sw2448A-ms98-a-0033 187.133625 188.444125 [silence]
sw2448A-ms98-a-0034 188.444125 193.317125 and uh according to Virginia it didn't cost all that much
sw2448A-ms98-a-0035 193.317125 202.078625 and frankly i- i don't understand why a state doesn't have those records available anyway uh uh at least
sw2448A-ms98-a-0036 202.078625 209.476250 uh records of of uh known felons [noise] which are available to local police departments
sw2448A-ms98-a-0037 209.476250 212.119375 [silence]
sw2448A-ms98-a-0038 212.119375 218.062000 uh uh uh certainly those those records are available and all they would have to do is expand it
sw2448A-ms98-a-0039 218.062000 222.001000 to uh uh well connect them into a modem somehow
sw2448A-ms98-a-0040 222.001000 225.910000 [silence]
sw2448A-ms98-a-0041 225.910000 231.844500 well Virginia is not a particularly rich state and they managed to fi[nd]- squeak out a few bucks to do it
sw2448A-ms98-a-0042 231.844500 232.992750 [silence]
sw2448A-ms98-a-0043 232.992750 237.476375 and uh it's uh uh one hundred percent successful 
sw2448A-ms98-a-0044 237.476375 238.835375 [silence]
sw2448A-ms98-a-0045 238.835375 244.699125 yeah i just heard about this last week uh they were bragging about it with uh uh
sw2448A-ms98-a-0046 244.699125 249.653250 they should have have pride in this because_1 it's it's a good system and it's working well
sw2448A-ms98-a-0047 249.653250 252.747875 and they don't need that seven day waiting period 
sw2448A-ms98-a-0048 252.747875 258.887625 because_1 the whole idea of that waiting period was so that uh it uh the police could check up on you
sw2448A-ms98-a-0049 258.887625 264.057250 well you know what's going to happen there those files are going to back up on somebody's desk
sw2448A-ms98-a-0050 264.057250 267.180875 just a that typical bureaucratic work
sw2448A-ms98-a-0051 267.180875 270.195500 [laughter] that's another
sw2448A-ms98-a-0052 270.195500 274.253000 uh uh thorn in my side bureaucratics
sw2448A-ms98-a-0053 274.253000 276.113750 politicians
sw2448A-ms98-a-0054 276.113750 277.828625 [silence]
sw2448A-ms98-a-0055 277.828625 282.048500 so anyway well we seem to be one in favor and one against
sw2448A-ms98-a-0056 282.048500 287.501000 although neither one of us are are uh really uh uh dyed in the wool
sw2448A-ms98-a-0057 287.501000 289.527500 uh we but we both
sw2448A-ms98-a-0058 289.527500 295.336250 [silence]
sw2448A-ms98-a-0059 295.336250 302.286375 well there should be some way of checking now here in in Texas uh all you need is a driver's license
sw2448A-ms98-a-0060 302.286375 306.839875 and uh even felons can still get a driver's license
sw2448A-ms98-a-0061 306.839875 310.670125 so i- i don't think they are too
sw2448A-ms98-a-0062 310.670125 314.019875 well they're not rigid enough here in Texas
sw2448A-ms98-a-0063 314.019875 316.835000 but don't tell the NRA i said that
sw2448A-ms98-a-0064 316.835000 319.312625 they're liable to tear up my membership
sw2448A-ms98-a-0065 319.312625 321.903125 [laughter]
sw2448A-ms98-a-0066 321.903125 324.325750 you say you retired a year ago

sw2448A-ms98-a-0070 331.751125 341.054500 [silence]

sw2448A-ms98-a-0072 351.965000 353.420250 [silence]

sw2448A-ms98-a-0074 361.438000 363.484625 [silence]
sw2448A-ms98-a-0075 363.484625 366.595375 well Charles good luck to you on your
