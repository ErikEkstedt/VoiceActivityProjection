sw2437A-ms98-a-0006 8.939000 10.037250 [silence]
sw2437A-ms98-a-0007 10.037250 16.432500 oh yeah yeah i[n]- i[n]- in fact with me uh this is uh it's not much to talk about i i'm so
sw2437A-ms98-a-0008 16.432500 24.824375 much for it i don't really have much to comment about it uh there's been some interesting subjects that they've ca[lled]- how many times have you called or have you been participating in this uh
sw2437A-ms98-a-0009 24.824375 26.640625 [silence]
sw2437A-ms98-a-0010 26.640625 30.489625 oh you got ten well you you've passed me up this is about six times
sw2437A-ms98-a-0011 30.489625 33.859625 [silence]
sw2437A-ms98-a-0012 33.859625 35.240875 yeah
sw2437A-ms98-a-0013 35.240875 38.290500 [silence]
sw2437A-ms98-a-0014 38.290500 45.111125 no i think it's good in fact uh i don't know what the statistics were but i think that they were very surprised to find it
sw2437A-ms98-a-0015 45.111125 52.777000 so low i think they were expecting it to find uh like the national average at TI and i think it was tremendously down
sw2437A-ms98-a-0016 52.777000 54.611750 i think
sw2437A-ms98-a-0017 54.611750 67.059375 yeah a[s]- as far as the number of people that they actually found that were drug use[rs]- but i think that uh i was well you ha[d]- when i was at TI of course we had all the information before they started
sw2437A-ms98-a-0018 67.059375 80.071500 and they said that a certain number of people that the heavy drug users would either quit or go in [rela/rehabilitation] rehabilitation programs and i think that's what helps you know that that you know warning when you have a drug program
sw2437A-ms98-a-0019 80.071500 93.220750 uh you know the people that are worried about it or are taking drugs actually go and then uh usually a lot of them uh partake in uh some of the benefits o[f]- of rehabilitation and everything so
sw2437A-ms98-a-0020 93.220750 95.589500 [silence]
sw2437A-ms98-a-0021 95.589500 98.885125 yeah our our numbers have been way down i don't know what they were
sw2437A-ms98-a-0022 98.885125 106.684375 [silence]
sw2437A-ms98-a-0023 106.684375 108.450875 yeah
sw2437A-ms98-a-0024 108.450875 122.143250 [silence]
sw2437A-ms98-a-0025 122.143250 123.881125 oh really
sw2437A-ms98-a-0026 123.881125 127.012125 [silence]
sw2437A-ms98-a-0027 127.012125 135.778375 oh yeah you're that's a good point but at TI they before they had the testing i've forgotten i[t]- s[eems]- seems like it's a year ago September something like that
sw2437A-ms98-a-0028 135.778375 142.322875 they told us that the agency that did it was the one that did it for the government and and that of course that's critical just as the point that you're brought up that
sw2437A-ms98-a-0029 142.322875 152.480625 whoever does your testing -[ha]s got to be you know have a lot of quality control that they keep track of everything they don't make mistakes that would be terribly embarrassing
sw2437A-ms98-a-0030 152.480625 158.348625 for someone to really come back positive and they were not and i haven't heard of any now i'm not in personnel or anything
sw2437A-ms98-a-0031 158.348625 170.156500 but uh they say that there it's almost down to zero where people come back and say they are positive and and they're not you know in other words there's very few mistakes and that of course has got to be critical it's got to be
sw2437A-ms98-a-0032 170.156500 181.905000 if you have a drug testing program it's got to be with a very very good agency you don't just have you know some local uh group do it it's got to be a a a highly qualified agency
sw2437A-ms98-a-0033 181.905000 183.496500 [silence]
sw2437A-ms98-a-0034 183.496500 193.664375 no you don't want to do that it's got to be you know a laboratory that do quality control and and double check and i think that TI has has latched themselves up with an established group
sw2437A-ms98-a-0035 193.664375 199.344750 a[nd]- and that would be true for any company that does it and and not to have a just a very casual thing it's got to be with a
sw2437A-ms98-a-0036 199.344750 210.170125 you know first class totally independent agency not local of course ours i think well i think it was in in the south somewhere but it wasn't even in Dallas you know the one that did us yeah
sw2437A-ms98-a-0037 210.170125 215.654500 [silence]
sw2437A-ms98-a-0038 215.654500 229.948375 oh no no they're not fired they there are they have one chance to then go in a program if you come back positive you have one chance to go in and go into they have a lot of uh rehabilitation both for alcohol and for drug use uh
sw2437A-ms98-a-0039 229.948375 237.801250 and they have uh a lot of uh th[ey]- they have an agency where you can go for personal problems financial or whatever
sw2437A-ms98-a-0040 237.801250 245.739125 and so they they they they don't no it's not firing first it's uh definitely try to encourage people to rehabilitate in fact they
sw2437A-ms98-a-0041 245.739125 254.583125 again before you go you know tha[t's]- that's why i said when they first started it they had a rehabilitation program in effect that said if you worried about this and if you may have taken drugs
sw2437A-ms98-a-0042 254.583125 259.978500 go ahead and and get rehabilitated first and and and they won't even say anything about it you know 
sw2437A-ms98-a-0043 259.978500 261.291625 [silence]
sw2437A-ms98-a-0044 261.291625 262.604875 oh sure
sw2437A-ms98-a-0045 262.604875 263.921375 [silence]
sw2437A-ms98-a-0046 263.921375 276.437625 oh yeah no that that's not right it's really uh an illness or whatever you want to say that it is you know it's a weakness and all and wh[o]- who all of us have weaknesses of one kind or another and i think that uh
sw2437A-ms98-a-0047 276.437625 287.578500 those people that have that and and however they got into it i have children i always worry about the the classical thing that you see on TV where the drug uh pushers
sw2437A-ms98-a-0048 287.578500 301.839250 give it to the kids for free you know and get them_1 sucked in and then they sell it to them_1 you know the classical thing is to give it away or i always worry about my teenage daughters going to some party and they slip it to them_1 i i don't know i don't even have that much knowledge to know
sw2437A-ms98-a-0049 301.839250 308.009625 whether that would uh get them_1 addicted or not you know tha[t]- that's a real worry
sw2437A-ms98-a-0050 308.009625 314.210625 [silence]
sw2437A-ms98-a-0051 314.210625 316.682875 oh you know a lot about it then yeah
sw2437A-ms98-a-0052 316.682875 318.720000 no
sw2437A-ms98-a-0053 318.720000 322.971000 [noise] 
sw2437A-ms98-a-0054 322.971000 324.191875 yeah
sw2437A-ms98-a-0055 324.191875 326.041875 [silence]
sw2437A-ms98-a-0056 326.041875 340.861375 yeah i know i i'm glad of that and i have uh knock wood had uh pretty good luck with or very good luck with my daughters so far [vocalized-noise] [noise] know they're not on it that's my [vocalized-noise] phone i i i have one daughter still at home one's at UT and one's at home gets dozens of calls a night 
sw2437A-ms98-a-0057 340.861375 348.223250 uh no no no no no i i i don't care about that tha[t]- tha[t]- she she'll be on the phone all night yeah
sw2437A-ms98-a-0058 348.223250 353.551750 [silence]
sw2437A-ms98-a-0059 353.551750 355.427625 right
sw2437A-ms98-a-0060 355.427625 357.127000 do you have children
sw2437A-ms98-a-0061 357.127000 358.544125 [silence]
sw2437A-ms98-a-0062 358.544125 371.852750 oh well great oh fan[tastic]- fantastic experience i've got two as i said i've got one in at UT now in Austin [noise] and one at home and uh i always say that i've learned so much more from them than i than ever taught them 
sw2437A-ms98-a-0063 371.852750 375.412625 it's a uh fantastic experi[ence]- you ca[n't]-
sw2437A-ms98-a-0064 375.412625 376.959875 oh yeah y[ou]-
sw2437A-ms98-a-0065 376.959875 385.530000 [silence]
sw2437A-ms98-a-0066 385.530000 386.867375 yeah
sw2437A-ms98-a-0067 386.867375 389.928000 [noise] 
sw2437A-ms98-a-0068 389.928000 399.091625 the the key thing that i think uh we try to do is that bring all the friends over here have our house as a place where they can come at any time
sw2437A-ms98-a-0069 399.091625 412.018625 so that you always see their friends rather than make them not welcome and they're always over in someone else's house so our we've been lucky that uh our house is usually the place where the kids could come you know and
sw2437A-ms98-a-0070 412.018625 425.622750 and then you can kind of keep an [noise] you can make judgments and make comments or whatever you want but at least you see what's going on and uh you always have your house welcome then then your children'll think that uh you know you're cool parents and all that you know 
sw2437A-ms98-a-0071 425.622750 438.274875 we[ll]- well good luck with your your expected uh baby there uh my wife was yelling in my e[ar]- was talking in my ear she said uh reminded me to say that uh they're very cheap until they get get to start driving
sw2437A-ms98-a-0072 438.274875 450.050875 and we have one of course i say in college driving and and one going to drive this summer so uh kids are cost you practically nothing because_1 you always get so many things from your relatives and everything but
sw2437A-ms98-a-0073 450.050875 457.506625 you wait until they go and get a car [noise] insurance and you and that's when they get expensive as they get older you know uh i[t]- i[t]- 
sw2437A-ms98-a-0074 457.506625 466.155125 th[ey]- they cost you practically nothing from one to five and then slowly but surely starts to creep up when they start to take lessons [noise] [noise] but uh it's well worth it and everything 
sw2437A-ms98-a-0075 466.155125 470.160500 [silence]
sw2437A-ms98-a-0076 470.160500 477.227375 be great it's a great experience really you still there okay i thought that was cut off there but
sw2437A-ms98-a-0077 477.227375 481.178125 well good you know i don't have much to say about drug testing uh
