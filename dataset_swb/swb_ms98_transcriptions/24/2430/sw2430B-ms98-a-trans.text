sw2430B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 5.513000 [silence]
sw2430B-ms98-a-0002 5.513000 14.270375 i do all my own maintenance matter of fact i just finished putting a timing chain in my wife's Toyota [laughter] i do i do all of that myself
sw2430B-ms98-a-0003 14.270375 21.950750 [silence]
sw2430B-ms98-a-0004 21.950750 24.366250 oh sure sure
sw2430B-ms98-a-0005 24.366250 32.405750 [silence]
sw2430B-ms98-a-0006 32.405750 37.620000 well there's two things that drive that up here one is we is the lack of
sw2430B-ms98-a-0007 37.620000 39.426625 good service people
sw2430B-ms98-a-0008 39.426625 44.122000 because there just aren't are not any left hardly around up in this area
sw2430B-ms98-a-0009 44.122000 48.831125 and the other thing is the cost it's almost prohibitive to bring it to a dealer
sw2430B-ms98-a-0010 48.831125 54.388750 [silence]
sw2430B-ms98-a-0011 54.388750 59.139750 oh sure sure the the price is astronomical but what i do is
sw2430B-ms98-a-0012 59.139750 65.124500 i like to do this okay and i and i i like to play with mechanics and that's i really i've done that all my life so
sw2430B-ms98-a-0013 65.124500 66.280250 [silence]
sw2430B-ms98-a-0014 66.280250 67.753375 and the
sw2430B-ms98-a-0015 67.753375 76.599375 the little the little Toyota is a nineteen eighty three so [laughter] i really don't have too much to lose if i mess it up too bad [laughter-you] [laughter-know]
sw2430B-ms98-a-0016 76.599375 79.996000 the timing chain well the camshaft timing chain
sw2430B-ms98-a-0017 79.996000 82.049000 [silence]
sw2430B-ms98-a-0018 82.049000 87.094625 okay it's in the front of the engine uh say like directly behind the radiator or the water pump
sw2430B-ms98-a-0019 87.094625 95.291625 and it it drives from the crankshaft it drives uh a chain that drives the camshaft which is an overhead cam in those foreign cars
sw2430B-ms98-a-0020 95.291625 102.259125 and uh i[t]- it was getting kind of worn the car has a hundred and one thousand miles on it and it was getting a little noisy so
sw2430B-ms98-a-0021 102.259125 111.757000 not so much for the noise but if it were to jump a tooth or something of that nature i would be in serious problems on the freeway and i didn't want to chance Irene driving the car like that so
sw2430B-ms98-a-0022 111.757000 112.470000 i
sw2430B-ms98-a-0023 112.470000 113.182875 [silence]
sw2430B-ms98-a-0024 113.182875 121.159500 oh three nights i worked on it three nights and about four hours on last Saturday and i just put it in the garage and worked on i[t]- i ha[ve]- i have a new Oldsmobile [laughter-so] [laughter-i] [laughter-really]
sw2430B-ms98-a-0025 121.159500 131.233875 uh i[t's]- it's it's just a little hobby and if it's not too cold outside and the weather's starting to get pretty nice so if it's not too too cold out i can go out work on it don't have heat in the garage or anything but
sw2430B-ms98-a-0026 131.233875 132.535875 uh
sw2430B-ms98-a-0027 132.535875 139.977375 well i figured if i had it done in the garage at the Toyota dealer i would be looking at probably three or four hundred dollars
sw2430B-ms98-a-0028 139.977375 146.082500 between the gasket kit and the new distributor cap i put on and the new uh chain and the labor
sw2430B-ms98-a-0029 146.082500 147.490875 [silence]
sw2430B-ms98-a-0030 147.490875 151.684500 well the parts to to me i spent twenty two dollars on the parts
sw2430B-ms98-a-0031 151.684500 153.526500 [laughter-yeah]
sw2430B-ms98-a-0032 153.526500 162.483750 so i really i really don't have heart burn at all with doing it myself over four nights tie i tied the car up if four days but we're fortunate we didn't need it
sw2430B-ms98-a-0033 162.483750 164.923375 [silence]
sw2430B-ms98-a-0034 164.923375 177.602250 no i know but you know you you save the markup on the parts and of course you buy them whole sale from the parts store and and you can save a little bit there and you can save an awful lot on the labor which is high today like all the rest of us we expect top dollar for what we do and
sw2430B-ms98-a-0035 177.602250 183.481125 i d[on't]- i don't blame the garage people it's just that it's very very hard to find anybody here that's willing to do that type of work
sw2430B-ms98-a-0036 183.481125 195.853500 all of our so called garages are now a convenience stores that sell gasoline and they really don't do any repairs anymore so you know you're you're you['re]- you're almost tied to the dealer to go back to them and
sw2430B-ms98-a-0037 195.853500 198.887250 well it seems like they're just swamped with work so
sw2430B-ms98-a-0038 198.887250 207.916375 [silence]
sw2430B-ms98-a-0039 207.916375 209.348250 sure
sw2430B-ms98-a-0040 209.348250 210.564000 sure
sw2430B-ms98-a-0041 210.564000 213.414125 [silence]
sw2430B-ms98-a-0042 213.414125 214.497375 uh-huh
sw2430B-ms98-a-0043 214.497375 217.998500 [silence]
sw2430B-ms98-a-0044 217.998500 223.587250 sure and that['s]- that's held in by two bolts and a bracket and a plug of wire in the bottom of it no
sw2430B-ms98-a-0045 223.587250 227.935500 [silence]
sw2430B-ms98-a-0046 227.935500 229.574875 i'm sure you could of
sw2430B-ms98-a-0047 229.574875 233.006250 [silence]
sw2430B-ms98-a-0048 233.006250 233.979250 uh-huh
sw2430B-ms98-a-0049 233.979250 237.028625 [silence]
sw2430B-ms98-a-0050 237.028625 238.198000 uh-huh
sw2430B-ms98-a-0051 238.198000 250.359125 [silence]
sw2430B-ms98-a-0052 250.359125 255.807000 okay yeah that's one of those that sits up at an angle back there yeah ok[ay]- yeah yeah
sw2430B-ms98-a-0053 255.807000 264.121375 well that's that's another problem you know and if you don't have all these special tools of course like i said we're very fortunate with the older cars we can work on them what
sw2430B-ms98-a-0054 264.121375 273.053500 um if you don't have all the special tools and the technology i i'd i would hate to buy a brand new car today with the electronics that are in them_1
sw2430B-ms98-a-0055 273.053500 276.812750 i imagine that would be a bear to work on you know uh
sw2430B-ms98-a-0056 276.812750 280.140500 [silence]
sw2430B-ms98-a-0057 280.140500 281.650375 sure
sw2430B-ms98-a-0058 281.650375 285.082375 uh-huh ye[s]- that's absolutely true [noise]
sw2430B-ms98-a-0059 285.082375 291.269250 uh have you done have you done much repair work yourself o[ther]- other than just routine maintenance like oil changes and stuff
sw2430B-ms98-a-0060 291.269250 292.980000 [silence]
sw2430B-ms98-a-0061 292.980000 293.979125 yeah
sw2430B-ms98-a-0062 293.979125 305.737375 [silence]
sw2430B-ms98-a-0063 305.737375 307.302375 sure
sw2430B-ms98-a-0064 307.302375 312.575250 [silence]
sw2430B-ms98-a-0065 312.575250 321.296375 that rotary engine always fascinated me i wa[s]- i was always enthralled by the rotary engine i think that's a neat idea and i'm surprised we haven't gone that way more and and
sw2430B-ms98-a-0066 321.296375 323.696875 yep yep
sw2430B-ms98-a-0067 323.696875 325.716375 [silence]
sw2430B-ms98-a-0068 325.716375 334.750500 it's a smooth running quiet car i i just i don't know why well perhaps the the retooling cost were probably prohibitive to most companies you know
sw2430B-ms98-a-0069 334.750500 337.829250 [silence]
sw2430B-ms98-a-0070 337.829250 349.653625 the uh the automotive industry is in dire needs of something in this in this country and it's too bad uh the Toyota we bought i i bought second hand i did not buy it new uh
sw2430B-ms98-a-0071 349.653625 363.612750 but if you look at what's in that little car and as opposed to what's in some of the American cars you can see where we're probably a half a step behind and i think i think we're trying to do something to correct that but i think we got away from us a little bit so
sw2430B-ms98-a-0072 363.612750 370.004000 but i- i i i just like i say to work on it myself i one i like to do that
sw2430B-ms98-a-0073 370.004000 382.053250 uh i i think i would do all of the maintenance i change my own oil and i change of course spark plugs and stuff like that that's routine that i i would call routine maintenance once a year i do that every fall i get ready for the winter
sw2430B-ms98-a-0074 382.053250 393.358625 and i even lubricate the car myself because i have a i have means of of running it up on on jack stands and and you know i have a creeper and i crawl around underneath it so it's not a big deal
sw2430B-ms98-a-0075 393.358625 394.600500 [silence]
sw2430B-ms98-a-0076 394.600500 406.279875 but even today like with your waste oil when you drain the oil and change the oil now i have to bring it to a disposal center i c[an]- i no longer can put it in in the trash you know or in a container yeah we have
sw2430B-ms98-a-0077 406.279875 410.821750 we're we're really on an ecology kick up here i guess like all the rest of the country and
sw2430B-ms98-a-0078 410.821750 422.660625 a[nd]- and they really really they come down and pound you real hard if they catch you dumping oil on the ground because it does go in and it effects the lakes and streams and it eventually winds up on the ocean here and it really makes a mess around around New England
sw2430B-ms98-a-0079 422.660625 430.773000 so we have to take the oil to uh a uh a disposal center that's an EPA you know authorized disposal center
sw2430B-ms98-a-0080 430.773000 439.715125 and they gladly take it but they only take it like for two hours on a Saturday morning you know and it's it gets to be a pain sometime to go through that but i think it's still worth it in the long run
sw2430B-ms98-a-0081 439.715125 446.905625 because oil you can buy for eighty five cents a quart but if you buy that same oil at a dealer it's going to cost you probably two dollars a quart
sw2430B-ms98-a-0082 446.905625 449.476625 and uh and now the labor to put it in
sw2430B-ms98-a-0083 449.476625 458.966250 and uh i i again i like to do that i i would do all the maintenance on my car if i could uh
sw2430B-ms98-a-0084 458.966250 471.925500 you know e[ven]- even into major things just to keep our car longer because i don't think we get the money that we put into them out of them_1 in two years or three years and of course i was never in a [laughter-position] where i could trade my car off every two years
sw2430B-ms98-a-0085 471.925500 475.423750 [silence]
sw2430B-ms98-a-0086 475.423750 489.284875 uh well i i like i said i've done mechanics all my life and i do that with the company so uh i'm a senior engineer for them so [laughter-i] [laughter-am] mechanics and i i just uh i enjoy it i really it's like a diversion for me i i think if i had to do it
sw2430B-ms98-a-0087 489.284875 503.555875 if i had to do automotive repair or or anything i love to do woodwork and too and it's a diversion because i know i'd really don't have to do [laughter-this] [laughter-okay] so i think i like that because i know i don't have to do this but if if i were forced to do it that may be a different situation 
sw2430B-ms98-a-0088 503.555875 504.595250 [silence]
sw2430B-ms98-a-0089 504.595250 513.581250 uh it sure has i really appreciate your call and uh [laughter] it's nice to talk with you folks from from down in the in the main office area and
sw2430B-ms98-a-0090 513.581250 516.682625 yeah sure how's your weather it's pretty good
sw2430B-ms98-a-0091 516.682625 530.875375 yeah we're just starting to get some nice little warm weather up here in New England it got up to seventy today that's a good sign [laughter-we] we we've been running around twenty in the morning and getting real cold and it's too cold to work on automobiles outside generally but we had the last few days been pretty nice
sw2430B-ms98-a-0092 530.875375 537.590000 i appreciate your call and you enjoy yourself if you're ever up this way look me up in Attenborough okay sir thank you again
