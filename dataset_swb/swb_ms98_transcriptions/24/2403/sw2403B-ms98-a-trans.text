sw2403B-ms98-a-0010 37.353875 47.512750 was behind completely but getting into their countries' uh civil wars no i don't think that that we should have to take that responsibility um i think that they should be totally
sw2403B-ms98-a-0011 47.512750 56.274875 uh able to handle it themselves i mean if we went and policed just like you say every country when they had squabbles uh

sw2403B-ms98-a-0013 58.335500 68.751500 well that's true and we've done it before because of i think more that that we are afraid Russia was going to get in on it and it's going to be a battle for you know but uh no i

sw2403B-ms98-a-0017 88.454625 101.885000 i think that now instead of coming to the US for help in their civil wars and things they should go to the UN and if they need help it should be handled through the UN and not through the Uni[ted]- uh not the United States
sw2403B-ms98-a-0018 101.885000 103.040625 [silence]

sw2403B-ms98-a-0033 180.723625 194.841875 i th[ink]- really think we should let the UN take care of [laughter-things] instead of uh us being responsible because you know you hear all this about government spending and about the budget and [vocalized-noise] and all this other and uh
