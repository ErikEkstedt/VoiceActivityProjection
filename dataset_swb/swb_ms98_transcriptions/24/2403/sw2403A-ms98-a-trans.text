sw2403A-ms98-a-0038 250.295000 253.654500 and we're not smart enough to know who's right and wrong either
sw2403A-ms98-a-0039 253.654500 258.765375 maybe the you know there's no telling what the Kurds did at some point in time
sw2403A-ms98-a-0040 258.765375 265.567750 you know we just we're not smart enough to be objective with all these situations and say okay these are the ones this is the side we should be on
sw2403A-ms98-a-0041 265.567750 295.044875 [silence]
sw2403A-ms98-a-0042 295.044875 297.930375 and we have so many internal problems

sw2403A-ms98-a-0054 358.871750 360.586000 i th[ink]- i think we're
sw2403A-ms98-a-0055 360.586000 368.743250 i think that we have a s[ocial]- a social disease called poverty i think people get into the syndrome of poverty
sw2403A-ms98-a-0056 368.743250 371.630625 and they don't know how to get back out again
sw2403A-ms98-a-0057 371.630625 376.594125 they're they're following what their parents did and their parents did

sw2403A-ms98-a-0059 387.229875 399.551875 but the money they get is just i mean it's borderline survival i couldn't live on two hundred and thirty dollars a month i can't go to the grocery store twice for that kind of money

sw2403A-ms98-a-0065 439.326875 449.628000 and hopefully things are more merciful where you are but we actually had some ho[meless]- uh street people picked up last week in Dallas for picking up tin cans

sw2403A-ms98-a-0079 523.153875 536.626875 well they may have come into their own because for so many years they were just a a lame duck organization that really didn't have anything and maybe they have at last achieved the status or the need for a
sw2403A-ms98-a-0080 536.626875 543.565875 organization such as that that they will achieve the status they should have had all along
sw2403A-ms98-a-0081 543.565875 552.625000 [silence]
sw2403A-ms98-a-0082 552.625000 563.732000 well the other way is to say no and to refer it to the U[N]- and just say i'm sorry you know we're not yes yes it's sad you're losing people but why should we lose people because you you know
sw2403A-ms98-a-0083 563.732000 570.720875 well that's not the answer though the answer is yes you're losing people and we're sorry but we're not the people to to make these decisions
