sw2424B-ms98-a-0031 145.200250 149.160625 so uh i mean you you can't believe what you what you hear
sw2424B-ms98-a-0032 149.160625 173.055500 [silence]
sw2424B-ms98-a-0033 173.055500 174.302750 oh

sw2424B-ms98-a-0035 175.604375 177.382125 uh yes
sw2424B-ms98-a-0036 177.382125 180.142250 [silence]
sw2424B-ms98-a-0037 180.142250 183.332000 [vocalized-noise] i agree and and uh
sw2424B-ms98-a-0038 183.332000 189.041250 uh i also think we extend too much help to other uh countries we need
sw2424B-ms98-a-0039 189.041250 191.572625 enough help here in this country
sw2424B-ms98-a-0040 191.572625 195.830125 they're still people starving people here why should we help starving people somewhere else
sw2424B-ms98-a-0041 195.830125 206.219500 [silence]
sw2424B-ms98-a-0042 206.219500 207.670625 abs[olutely]- absolutely
sw2424B-ms98-a-0043 207.670625 213.885125 now i can't wait for uh i- i could just picture wha[t's]- what's going to happen here in the not to distant future
sw2424B-ms98-a-0044 213.885125 219.414875 we keep hearing well we're going to receive uh eight billion dollars from Japan for the uh
sw2424B-ms98-a-0045 219.414875 221.382875 uh uh the
sw2424B-ms98-a-0046 221.382875 222.407625 [silence]
sw2424B-ms98-a-0047 222.407625 225.713875 uh uh the the the big war over there in the Mideast
sw2424B-ms98-a-0048 225.713875 230.487500 and uh so many billions of dollars here and there and everything and uh
sw2424B-ms98-a-0049 230.487500 235.263500 the next thing you know we'll be t[urning]- turning around just like we did to Poland and say well just forget it
sw2424B-ms98-a-0050 235.263500 240.013750 [silence]
sw2424B-ms98-a-0051 240.013750 241.378750 [noise] oh definitely
sw2424B-ms98-a-0052 241.378750 246.589500 [silence]
sw2424B-ms98-a-0053 246.589500 249.303250 well another thing now they they keep the
sw2424B-ms98-a-0054 249.303250 258.912000 decontrolling different things first it was the airlines then it was banks and and uh um savings association and what not
sw2424B-ms98-a-0055 258.912000 264.673125 exactly and the same with the airlines back in the days when they were uh controlled
sw2424B-ms98-a-0056 264.673125 270.117250 and and uh uh transcontinental or u[m]- u[m]- u[m]- u[m]- interstate
sw2424B-ms98-a-0057 270.117250 271.567125 uh trucking
sw2424B-ms98-a-0058 271.567125 272.617125 [silence]
sw2424B-ms98-a-0059 272.617125 279.759625 i mean as soon as the uh the federal government gave up control on all that they just went to hell in a hand basket
sw2424B-ms98-a-0060 279.759625 283.685250 uh prices went uh sky high
sw2424B-ms98-a-0061 283.685250 292.636250 you know in the in the case of airlines of course they became highly competitive and they cut each others throats until they're they're reach the point where they're cutting their own throat
sw2424B-ms98-a-0062 292.636250 294.186250 [silence]
sw2424B-ms98-a-0063 294.186250 298.978375 and uh well of course that's getting away from taxes isn't it th[at]- that's government controlled
sw2424B-ms98-a-0064 298.978375 299.990875 [silence]
sw2424B-ms98-a-0065 299.990875 301.061000 but um
sw2424B-ms98-a-0066 301.061000 340.375250 [silence]
sw2424B-ms98-a-0067 340.375250 342.792000 oh by the time you get through with the uh
sw2424B-ms98-a-0068 342.792000 344.615125 [silence]
sw2424B-ms98-a-0069 344.615125 345.918625 the penalties
sw2424B-ms98-a-0070 345.918625 353.042750 [silence]
sw2424B-ms98-a-0071 353.042750 357.806625 uh i agree i think the IRS is uh just too powerful
sw2424B-ms98-a-0072 357.806625 360.790875 there should be some sort of a control on it
sw2424B-ms98-a-0073 360.790875 363.363125 and they should be a little more humane
sw2424B-ms98-a-0074 363.363125 364.989375 [silence]
sw2424B-ms98-a-0075 364.989375 369.619375 uh the um well typical bureaucratic i guess
sw2424B-ms98-a-0076 369.619375 372.207750 uh that's that's one of my pet peeves
sw2424B-ms98-a-0077 372.207750 376.970625 [noise] i came up with a brilliant idea how we could reduce the uh the budget
sw2424B-ms98-a-0078 376.970625 385.363625 very simple give uh uh uh government employees the average number of of uh holidays as the uh
sw2424B-ms98-a-0079 385.363625 387.949000 uh the private industry
sw2424B-ms98-a-0080 387.949000 392.589750 i mean you think about it now they they get about sixteen holidays a year
sw2424B-ms98-a-0081 392.589750 393.634875 [silence]
sw2424B-ms98-a-0082 393.634875 397.826125 it sure is and i think here at TI we get what is it nine or ten
sw2424B-ms98-a-0083 397.826125 402.780125 [silence]
sw2424B-ms98-a-0084 402.780125 409.541625 well i remember uh thinking i think it was the last time i did hear that we get about the average maybe even a little more
sw2424B-ms98-a-0085 409.541625 412.274125 a day or so more than the average
sw2424B-ms98-a-0086 412.274125 416.065500 but uh government is ridiculous
sw2424B-ms98-a-0087 416.065500 418.530875 just think of the money they could save
sw2424B-ms98-a-0088 418.530875 421.460500 i mean they're they're paying out this money anyway
sw2424B-ms98-a-0089 421.460500 423.513500 why not get the work out of the people
sw2424B-ms98-a-0090 423.513500 425.507875 [silence]
sw2424B-ms98-a-0091 425.507875 430.010375 and well anyway that would of course eventually come back to taxes
sw2424B-ms98-a-0092 430.010375 431.321750 [silence]
sw2424B-ms98-a-0093 431.321750 436.476500 but uh as far as income tax is concerned i can't complain too much about it um
sw2424B-ms98-a-0094 436.476500 439.773625 i'm single i have no
sw2424B-ms98-a-0095 439.773625 443.732125 uh dependents or anything my children are all grown
sw2424B-ms98-a-0096 443.732125 447.408000 and they're out worrying about their own income taxes
sw2424B-ms98-a-0097 447.408000 479.075625 [silence]
sw2424B-ms98-a-0098 479.075625 481.825375 um very true that's
sw2424B-ms98-a-0099 481.825375 482.931625 [silence]
sw2424B-ms98-a-0100 482.931625 488.455250 and then they tell you to uh well invest it in uh is it IRA's or something and and w[hen]-
sw2424B-ms98-a-0101 488.455250 489.948875 when you turn
sw2424B-ms98-a-0102 489.948875 490.991000 [silence]
sw2424B-ms98-a-0103 490.991000 494.765375 when you turn sixty five why then you pay the tax on it
sw2424B-ms98-a-0104 494.765375 497.317875 and the tax is a lot less
sw2424B-ms98-a-0105 497.317875 498.561250 [silence]
sw2424B-ms98-a-0106 498.561250 501.341250 but in the mean time you u[sed]- used them
sw2424B-ms98-a-0107 501.341250 503.777125 you've got your money tide up
sw2424B-ms98-a-0108 503.777125 507.280250 in a low relatively low interest
sw2424B-ms98-a-0109 507.280250 510.652125 uh bearing investment
sw2424B-ms98-a-0110 510.652125 515.878500 i mean it's not making ten fifteen percent like a business is today
sw2424B-ms98-a-0111 515.878500 517.507750 [silence]
sw2424B-ms98-a-0112 517.507750 520.987625 um me i'm a firm believer in that if you got it spend it
sw2424B-ms98-a-0113 520.987625 526.440000 [silence]
sw2424B-ms98-a-0114 526.440000 528.115625 [laughter] well you
