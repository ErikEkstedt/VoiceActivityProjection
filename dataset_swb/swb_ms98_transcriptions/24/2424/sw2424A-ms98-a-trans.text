sw2424A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 2.355125 okay
sw2424A-ms98-a-0002 2.355125 7.471875 well uh what do you think about taxes do you think we're paying too much
sw2424A-ms98-a-0003 7.471875 14.881750 [silence]
sw2424A-ms98-a-0004 14.881750 16.245125 um-hum

sw2424A-ms98-a-0006 41.264125 42.587500 yeah
sw2424A-ms98-a-0007 42.587500 54.781250 [silence]
sw2424A-ms98-a-0008 54.781250 56.198000 yeah
sw2424A-ms98-a-0009 56.198000 61.104500 [silence]
sw2424A-ms98-a-0010 61.104500 62.557625 how true
sw2424A-ms98-a-0011 62.557625 65.124750 [silence]
sw2424A-ms98-a-0012 65.124750 71.055875 yeah well gasoline especially in this part of the country we all use it all the time you know it's
sw2424A-ms98-a-0013 71.055875 73.995875 that's not what i would consider a luxury
sw2424A-ms98-a-0014 73.995875 92.210625 [silence]
sw2424A-ms98-a-0015 92.210625 93.508625 yeah
sw2424A-ms98-a-0016 93.508625 100.672500 [silence]
sw2424A-ms98-a-0017 100.672500 109.615375 well um i- i think that we probably are paying a little too much tax considering what we're getting for it and
sw2424A-ms98-a-0018 109.615375 117.249750 how it's being managed and so forth i mean i- i think there could be a better system and we would get more for our money
sw2424A-ms98-a-0019 117.249750 127.026750 it's totally out of our hands so we don't we can't really do a whole lot about how that money is spent and where it goes and and
sw2424A-ms98-a-0020 127.026750 132.980875 [silence]
sw2424A-ms98-a-0021 132.980875 134.661625 but not really
sw2424A-ms98-a-0022 134.661625 141.667125 [laughter]
sw2424A-ms98-a-0023 141.667125 143.235500 [silence]
sw2424A-ms98-a-0024 143.235500 144.544250 yeah
sw2424A-ms98-a-0025 144.544250 149.921875 [silence]
sw2424A-ms98-a-0026 149.921875 160.070500 well i think too one of the things that rubs me the wrong way the most is those programs that are funded by Congress and
sw2424A-ms98-a-0027 160.070500 161.731375 that
sw2424A-ms98-a-0028 161.731375 167.406000 don't seem to have any validity at all i mean they're always far out and
sw2424A-ms98-a-0029 167.406000 169.917375 uh you know they're studying some
sw2424A-ms98-a-0030 169.917375 171.549500 obscure
sw2424A-ms98-a-0031 171.549500 180.001250 uh bug [laughter-you] [laughter-know] [laughter-in] [laughter-some] [laughter-other] [laughter-part] [laughter-of] [laughter-the] [laughter-world] or some such thing and and our tax money pays for those things and i think that's wrong
sw2424A-ms98-a-0032 180.001250 181.086875 i
sw2424A-ms98-a-0033 181.086875 190.542750 [silence]
sw2424A-ms98-a-0034 190.542750 191.994375 that's right
sw2424A-ms98-a-0035 191.994375 196.128375 [silence]
sw2424A-ms98-a-0036 196.128375 198.992875 yeah and i think here lately they've
sw2424A-ms98-a-0037 198.992875 206.378625 been saying quite often and maybe somebody's coming to realize that we're the nation in trouble 
sw2424A-ms98-a-0038 206.378625 223.242500 [silence]
sw2424A-ms98-a-0039 223.242500 224.980000 the war
sw2424A-ms98-a-0040 224.980000 226.221125 um-hum
sw2424A-ms98-a-0041 226.221125 234.791000 [silence]
sw2424A-ms98-a-0042 234.791000 236.197125 yeah
sw2424A-ms98-a-0043 236.197125 239.639500 and i think that's a mistake
sw2424A-ms98-a-0044 239.639500 245.689625 somewhere somewhere you know we have to realize that we can't just keep giving it away
sw2424A-ms98-a-0045 245.689625 257.798250 [silence]
sw2424A-ms98-a-0046 257.798250 260.235625 we know what trouble they got into [laughter]
sw2424A-ms98-a-0047 260.235625 278.772125 [silence]
sw2424A-ms98-a-0048 278.772125 280.133250 yeah

sw2424A-ms98-a-0050 301.323750 308.322125 well i- i think another thing too that um i've had a little contacted with
sw2424A-ms98-a-0051 308.322125 316.764250 uh in regard to taxes let's say that um you have something that the IRS
sw2424A-ms98-a-0052 316.764250 326.641625 disagrees with or you know says hey we're not going to allow that well i think they're very unfair in the amount of
sw2424A-ms98-a-0053 326.641625 331.575375 penalties and interest that they can attach to that
sw2424A-ms98-a-0054 331.575375 339.070000 because you you will not only pay back that that you wrote off but you will at least double
sw2424A-ms98-a-0055 339.070000 341.665375 that amount and
sw2424A-ms98-a-0056 341.665375 345.654375 yes and that's to me there's something wrong there you know
sw2424A-ms98-a-0057 345.654375 353.480125 yeah i mean i can see paying the interest and some small penalty but they really stick it to you big time
sw2424A-ms98-a-0058 353.480125 362.895875 [silence]
sw2424A-ms98-a-0059 362.895875 365.357250 um-hum absolutely

sw2424A-ms98-a-0068 397.005500 399.158750 well i haven't counted
sw2424A-ms98-a-0069 399.158750 403.396375 i- i would have guessed eight even but you might be right i don't have any idea
sw2424A-ms98-a-0070 403.396375 411.368500 [silence]

sw2424A-ms98-a-0079 446.990000 448.270750 yeah
sw2424A-ms98-a-0080 448.270750 453.296250 well i- i have another thing that i thought about too um
sw2424A-ms98-a-0081 453.296250 459.871250 for instance when you try to save money and you earn interest on whatever your investment is
sw2424A-ms98-a-0082 459.871250 464.981250 and you know we're not typically talking about big dollars but
sw2424A-ms98-a-0083 464.981250 472.440000 here you feel like you've you've done something good you've you've earned your interest and then you have to go back and pay taxes on it
sw2424A-ms98-a-0084 472.440000 480.146625 so the real amount of your savings on that is is not much
sw2424A-ms98-a-0085 480.146625 483.127750 you know it's kind of a vicious circle there
sw2424A-ms98-a-0086 483.127750 488.264000 [silence]
sw2424A-ms98-a-0087 488.264000 490.815750 and then they took that away as far as
sw2424A-ms98-a-0088 490.815750 491.902250 being
sw2424A-ms98-a-0089 491.902250 496.979375 [silence]
sw2424A-ms98-a-0090 496.979375 498.070000 yeah

sw2424A-ms98-a-0104 543.865250 547.627875 [noise] well i guess we probably talked just about long enough
