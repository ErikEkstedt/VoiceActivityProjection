sw2459A-ms98-a-0003 3.924625 18.096500 well uh i'm i'm for it to be honest with you i think uh that um uh honestly if you feel you have something to hide that would tend to make you be against it but if you don't really have anything to hide even though i know it is sorted of an invasion in one's privacy
sw2459A-ms98-a-0004 18.096500 29.235750 uh i think as a protection for me and people who do know that we're drug clean if you will that uh it's one way to uh try to uh
sw2459A-ms98-a-0005 29.235750 37.726250 catch those who might not be and and k[inds]- and the kinds of problems that they can cause in the work environment or even outside the work environment i hate to think about
sw2459A-ms98-a-0006 37.726250 48.650125 uh the fact that uh i might have someone on the job who takes drugs and could maybe on the way home harm somebody uh if you know um running over them_1 or something like that
sw2459A-ms98-a-0007 48.650125 50.454625 [silence]
sw2459A-ms98-a-0008 50.454625 63.347875 oh yeah well that that's right i i i i haven't quite thought of that uh uh that's a very good point now limitations i i d[o]- i do think there needs to be some sort of limitations to the way you test because my wife who is a nurse
sw2459A-ms98-a-0009 63.347875 74.964125 tells me that there are a lot of drugs prescription drugs like that the uh medical profession can put people on and which could cause a test to show positive one point in fact uh that was not necessarily the case
sw2459A-ms98-a-0010 74.964125 89.849500 so it seems to me that uh even though i i personally think it's a good idea that there does need to be some some uh thought given to it some serious thought about how you can do it how you can exempt people at least the s[erious]- periods of time short or long periods of time uh
sw2459A-ms98-a-0011 89.849500 91.163125 um
sw2459A-ms98-a-0012 91.163125 96.487250 who are on prescription drugs or maybe come up with some other way of being able to test them
sw2459A-ms98-a-0013 96.487250 102.709125 i i don't know i i'm not in the medical profession so i wouldn't have any idea but what do you think about that

sw2459A-ms98-a-0023 129.851875 131.404250 oh yeah
sw2459A-ms98-a-0024 131.404250 133.001250 it's horrible

sw2459A-ms98-a-0026 144.042500 147.257750 right now they test athletes for uh
sw2459A-ms98-a-0027 147.257750 153.834125 yes steroids right yeah and the Olympics that's always that became a common practice several years ago
sw2459A-ms98-a-0028 153.834125 165.164250 and so it seems to me the idea of having random and i agree with the idea of random because that way nobody ever knows for sure when it might be their time i i uh agree that uh random checks uh
sw2459A-ms98-a-0029 165.164250 172.320125 of uh people be it in schooling systems or on the job uh i think the text the uh the topic was suppose to be on the job
sw2459A-ms98-a-0030 172.320125 186.745625 uh uh but i i think that uh that is uh w[ell]- i[n]- in this day and age if the problem ever got under control where it became no longer a problem then maybe you know you could let the rules relax somewhat but

sw2459A-ms98-a-0041 226.707375 240.352625 who are uh just as guilty of something that we want pre[vent]- prevent the student body from taking part in it d[oesn't]- doesn't set a good example there's also the matter of the same kinds of problems you get into in terms of handling ki[ds]- uh kids
sw2459A-ms98-a-0042 240.352625 247.429000 uh uh teaching kids uh it can cause erratic behavior it can cause all kinds of major problems

sw2459A-ms98-a-0088 414.238375 420.470500 oh yeah yeah well don't you think the government really in this case should set a good example by maybe doing it first

sw2459A-ms98-a-0090 423.323375 427.019000 well i agree i i concur a hundred percent i really do
sw2459A-ms98-a-0091 427.019000 438.767125 and uh it's not the sort of issue the people go and petition the legislatures to do uh uh unfortunately it seems to be the sort of thing that somehow or another legislatures do to pressure from the private sector who maybe having trouble
sw2459A-ms98-a-0092 438.767125 453.268125 have to eventually bring to the legislatures to get them to enact and then it final comes to government and i've always been a little disappointed that we the government sometimes don't initiate certain things like that i mean we we did back in the Kennedy time try to initiate the Civil Rights issue
sw2459A-ms98-a-0093 453.268125 460.205375 but o[n]- on on just hu[ndreds]- hundreds of other issues it seems like we sort of sit back and react rather than act

sw2459A-ms98-a-0101 494.671875 501.872750 oh yeah right well testing has several things that that uh come along with it it it it enables you to
sw2459A-ms98-a-0102 501.872750 510.086500 uh uh if you do find someone then it enables you do two things one it enables you to help them not necessarily to fire them
sw2459A-ms98-a-0103 510.086500 520.230125 but but it should be given in a positive light so that you can try to help them and at the same time you can find out where they're getting the substances from it puts pressure on those who would try to push things illegal like that
sw2459A-ms98-a-0104 520.230125 531.957750 because they know the people that they're pushing it to if they're in a work place where they can be randomly checked when it happens then they stand a chance of being turned in and you got ways now of cutting the whole drug traffic trade
sw2459A-ms98-a-0105 531.957750 535.359250 because of the fact that you've got that kind of pressure
