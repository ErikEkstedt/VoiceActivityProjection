sw2407B-ms98-a-0006 14.761500 19.326625 so you haven't really uh dealt with that in a sense

sw2407B-ms98-a-0012 30.675750 34.974250 uh mine are both out of school and uh
sw2407B-ms98-a-0013 34.974250 37.135125 you know i i've
sw2407B-ms98-a-0014 37.135125 48.367250 in hindsight seen some things that i wished that you know i had done something about that was you know within my power or uh
sw2407B-ms98-a-0015 48.367250 54.262000 you know wish that in some ways we as parents had more control over
sw2407B-ms98-a-0016 54.262000 59.327125 what's happening up there [laughter-you] [laughter-know] type thing um well
sw2407B-ms98-a-0017 59.327125 71.920250 just over the years there were situations that um uh came up that i didn't think were fair or handled correctly or the teachers didn't seem to be
sw2407B-ms98-a-0018 71.920250 76.527250 teaching anything of course it's a little hard to tell from
sw2407B-ms98-a-0019 76.527250 86.548625 the the information that you get from your child you know they they bring things home and i was never one to believe everything my kids said you [laughter-know] [laughter-about] something
sw2407B-ms98-a-0020 86.548625 99.282375 but uh still i i question the ability of some of the teachers to uh really do a bang-up job and yet others i know are just wonderful
sw2407B-ms98-a-0021 99.282375 120.993250 [silence]
sw2407B-ms98-a-0022 120.993250 122.265125 hum

sw2407B-ms98-a-0026 143.417375 145.757125 that's pretty interesting because just
sw2407B-ms98-a-0027 145.757125 149.516500 just because you know a subject matter doesn't mean you can teach it
sw2407B-ms98-a-0028 149.516500 157.220375 [silence]
sw2407B-ms98-a-0029 157.220375 162.033000 oh yeah in fact i think that's that's one of the big problems today is
sw2407B-ms98-a-0030 162.033000 173.404500 the the way the kids behave or act and and the way they are sometimes disinterested in what's going on in the class and disruptive
sw2407B-ms98-a-0031 173.404500 181.090125 [silence]

sw2407B-ms98-a-0040 229.748125 235.092000 yes some of those certainly have a lot of dis[abilities]- difficulties you know with uh
sw2407B-ms98-a-0041 235.092000 241.730875 all sorts of things and i would imagine their learning disabilities are quite large in some cases
sw2407B-ms98-a-0042 241.730875 257.695375 [silence]
sw2407B-ms98-a-0043 257.695375 260.141875 oh wow [laughter]
sw2407B-ms98-a-0044 260.141875 261.957500 that's encouraging [laughter]
sw2407B-ms98-a-0045 261.957500 286.468750 [silence]
sw2407B-ms98-a-0046 286.468750 294.910625 yeah well that's you know that's an idea maybe there need to be some radical changes made do some things that are
sw2407B-ms98-a-0047 294.910625 297.289375 totally different and unheard of
sw2407B-ms98-a-0048 297.289375 305.825375 [silence]

sw2407B-ms98-a-0057 341.334000 342.535500 [noise]
sw2407B-ms98-a-0058 342.535500 346.868125 nope and i would never have said so either uh
sw2407B-ms98-a-0059 346.868125 352.217250 but uh they managed to get through although not always
sw2407B-ms98-a-0060 352.217250 355.003375 with flying colors uh
sw2407B-ms98-a-0061 355.003375 368.205500 in fact one of the incidents i was thinking of that my son had um he was struggling with senior English and i had a meeting with the uh vice principal and the English instructor and
sw2407B-ms98-a-0062 368.205500 376.163500 uh she showed me a paper that he had just handed in and she told me what she had requested
sw2407B-ms98-a-0063 376.163500 386.568000 and i read it and while it had you know a few little grammatical problems it wasn't very long and so forth i thought it had some nice well thought out
sw2407B-ms98-a-0064 386.568000 398.144750 uh parts to it she gave him an F on that paper and i thought well now here you have a student who is trying to pass who is struggling with your subject and you give them an F
sw2407B-ms98-a-0065 398.144750 403.201875 on something that doesn't seem that bad to me what are you telling that student
sw2407B-ms98-a-0066 403.201875 408.087250 you're telling them that w[ell]- hey you might as well forget it you know

sw2407B-ms98-a-0070 471.305625 484.146500 yeah uh it's pretty sad to think uh about those who e[ven]- e[ven]- even today are graduating from school and they are telling that they don't know how to read you know

sw2407B-ms98-a-0082 533.617750 540.078875 that's interesting that the military saw that and did something about it you would have expected them to be the last ones to
