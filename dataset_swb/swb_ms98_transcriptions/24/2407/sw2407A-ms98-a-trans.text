sw2407A-ms98-a-0006 18.765750 31.490500 no but uh being one of these late in life mothers i've listened to everybody else's you know complaints as to wha[t's]- what what's the matter with either their kids or the school system so i've been surprised do are do you have school age kids
sw2407A-ms98-a-0007 31.490500 32.925125 [silence]

sw2407A-ms98-a-0016 98.658875 108.098125 well i heard a a frightening thing a[ctually]- actually i didn't hear it it was told to me or suggested to me uh that to work as a teacher
sw2407A-ms98-a-0017 108.098125 121.691000 in the public school systems in the state of Texas and i think it's similar in in many other states if you have a degree in a technical field you do not need a teaching certificate because there is such a shortage
sw2407A-ms98-a-0018 121.691000 129.482125 of uh people to teach math and sciences and somebody said well you know you could go in and and substitute teach
sw2407A-ms98-a-0019 129.482125 143.260875 at seventy five dollars a day and there's always going to be you know uh somebody having a need for a math or science teacher i thought Christ they're letting me in to you know this would be this would be frightening i don't know anything about it
sw2407A-ms98-a-0020 143.260875 147.572625 [silence]
sw2407A-ms98-a-0021 147.572625 148.997125 right
sw2407A-ms98-a-0022 148.997125 157.533625 right and even if i knew how to teach the subject matter i don't know if i'd know how to handle that kind of a a group of kids
sw2407A-ms98-a-0023 157.533625 170.513125 [silence]
sw2407A-ms98-a-0024 170.513125 181.937250 i tell you what i'm finding frightening and this comes from you know the the aging hippie near forty mother so i went through this period of supposedly you know cosmic social enlightenment
sw2407A-ms98-a-0025 181.937250 193.700000 i'm on i'm in the Plano school system and living in Richardson and there is a real dichotomy in terms of educational and economic background of the kids that are going to be attending this school
sw2407A-ms98-a-0026 193.700000 198.408375 and i used to think well that's wonderful you know they can get a real life experience
sw2407A-ms98-a-0027 198.408375 209.489375 what i'm seeing now uh in terms of kindergarten preparedness just from i[n]- in in different preschools it's like day and night and i wonder how do they handle
sw2407A-ms98-a-0028 209.489375 217.000000 a child who is obviously very ready and another child who doesn't even speak English let alone know her colors
sw2407A-ms98-a-0029 217.000000 222.802250 and they're in the same classrooms and i guess also you're going to see the first of the uh crack kids
sw2407A-ms98-a-0030 222.802250 227.619250 starting kindergarten my God i think it'd be next year is what i'd read
sw2407A-ms98-a-0031 227.619250 230.601250 i thought h[ow]- well how do you how do you weed those out
sw2407A-ms98-a-0032 230.601250 241.785125 [silence]
sw2407A-ms98-a-0033 241.785125 249.375625 and i was listening to NPR the National Public Radio and they've quoted statistics that i just about my throat just about fell into my toes
sw2407A-ms98-a-0034 249.375625 258.289125 they said at the bottom of the SAT scores of graduating college seniors are usually those people that go into education
sw2407A-ms98-a-0035 258.289125 259.500125 [silence]
sw2407A-ms98-a-0036 259.500125 261.065875 yes
sw2407A-ms98-a-0037 261.065875 266.501625 yes and i and i i got to thinking back when i was teaching college chemistry
sw2407A-ms98-a-0038 266.501625 275.968125 the people that t[ook]- took you know the lower level courses i sometimes wondered you know are they really even educatable or trainable and it my God you know
sw2407A-ms98-a-0039 275.968125 288.335875 uh are the rest of us who went for the big bucks you know staying out of you know wh[ere]- where maybe we should be kind of socially obligated to spend some time teaching or something with these kids i don't know
sw2407A-ms98-a-0040 288.335875 298.090500 [silence]
sw2407A-ms98-a-0041 298.090500 303.515250 well y[ou]- you know you you sit here and you think about that at the same time you think
sw2407A-ms98-a-0042 303.515250 314.706875 God i just hope i don't sound like a stage mother because i[f]- right now if you ask my friends tw[enty]- put twenty mothers in a room and ask them_1 how many have gifted children you're going to have twenty hands you know up there
sw2407A-ms98-a-0043 314.706875 319.307625 oh no nobody has nobody has a non gifted child
sw2407A-ms98-a-0044 319.307625 328.086125 and i keep thinking you know uh gifted is is Einstein or you know uh musical prodigies it's it's not a kid who's you know precocious
sw2407A-ms98-a-0045 328.086125 335.226875 you know what has you know ha[s]- has the educational system been watered down to that anybody who's above average is now gifted
sw2407A-ms98-a-0046 335.226875 336.959375 i don't know
sw2407A-ms98-a-0047 336.959375 341.553750 [silence]
sw2407A-ms98-a-0048 341.553750 343.771875 oh don't say that
sw2407A-ms98-a-0049 343.771875 387.767625 [silence]
sw2407A-ms98-a-0050 387.767625 389.049125 um-hum
sw2407A-ms98-a-0051 389.049125 400.783750 [silence]
sw2407A-ms98-a-0052 400.783750 401.958500 um-hum
sw2407A-ms98-a-0053 401.958500 406.751000 [silence]
sw2407A-ms98-a-0054 406.751000 419.995750 well you see i think that that just harks right back to the elementary and junior high years because_1 i have a stepson now who's twenty five and uh i was just absolutely shocked
sw2407A-ms98-a-0055 419.995750 433.276625 uh the first time that i saw his schoolwork uh i remember being you know taught and i think you know i[t]- you have to teach how to write an answer and you know how to construct a thought process
sw2407A-ms98-a-0056 433.276625 434.702625 and
sw2407A-ms98-a-0057 434.702625 445.272375 you know they can get a th[ey]- they can grasp the points can they convey the data verbally or in writing and that's what's you know really scary to me um
sw2407A-ms98-a-0058 445.272375 452.410375 i would really you know there's such a a p[ush]- push a[mong]- among young mothers these days to make sure their child is computer literate
sw2407A-ms98-a-0059 452.410375 457.731375 i would really think that they should be stressing more can the kid write a thought
sw2407A-ms98-a-0060 457.731375 469.206875 and at an early age and if they can't i mean if they have missed that training then somebody you know before you're you you start penalizing them_1 with bad grades for not being able to communicate what they're thinking
sw2407A-ms98-a-0061 469.206875 471.860750 teach them these basic skills
sw2407A-ms98-a-0062 471.860750 482.757000 [silence]
sw2407A-ms98-a-0063 482.757000 486.617250 well [vocalized-noise] my stepson you know i
sw2407A-ms98-a-0064 486.617250 496.540250 he went into the Navy or Air Force i just really get my military i married into a military family and i don't know i re[ally]- address them_1 all as generals so i don't offend anybody
sw2407A-ms98-a-0065 496.540250 502.842625 but uh you know fortunately for him he wasn't dumb but boy he sure had trouble you know putting things on on paper
sw2407A-ms98-a-0066 502.842625 512.687625 and one of the things that that they did for him they tested him and they said that he's you know great in electronics but he you know he's really does need the basic skills and they put him through six months
sw2407A-ms98-a-0067 512.687625 522.985250 of composition writing in addition to all his electronic training and at that point he has now graduated from warfare electronics school with honors
sw2407A-ms98-a-0068 522.985250 528.366500 this is the kid who who really y[ou]- you know barely made it through high school
sw2407A-ms98-a-0069 528.366500 534.802875 and i keep thinking you know it's not it's really not too late at any point to do you know some
sw2407A-ms98-a-0070 534.802875 537.255000 [silence]
sw2407A-ms98-a-0071 537.255000 538.966375 yes
sw2407A-ms98-a-0072 538.966375 544.084000 but yes and i kind of have always pooh-poohed military educations
sw2407A-ms98-a-0073 544.084000 552.816500 but i think that for this kid it's going to be you know his lifesaver otherwise he might have been driving trucks or framing houses you know from here to eternity
sw2407A-ms98-a-0074 552.816500 555.948875 so i don't know you know it does make me nervous
sw2407A-ms98-a-0075 555.948875 561.958125 [silence]
sw2407A-ms98-a-0076 561.958125 570.838875 [laughter] there is a whole lot of stuff going on out there and and part of me says i just would like to you know shut my eyes and pretend it doesn't you know go on
sw2407A-ms98-a-0077 570.838875 583.179375 or send them_1 to private schools and then the you know the old social conscience says you know i'm not working i don't need to work maybe i should volunteer to you know teach what i know
sw2407A-ms98-a-0078 583.179375 595.378625 maybe adult literacy maybe you know composition writing maybe you know uh volunteering you know on a tutor line or though the even through the elementary schools for help with homework or
sw2407A-ms98-a-0079 595.378625 598.943250 the other part of me says is God i've had enough kids [laughter] do i real[ly]-
