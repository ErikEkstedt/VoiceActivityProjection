sw2488B-ms98-a-0042 146.766625 161.319000 my gosh the only thing about the death penalty and an[d]- i know that that they try to be careful and they try to be sure but these people are on death row for like twenty years you know an[d]- you know if if
sw2488B-ms98-a-0043 161.319000 169.780500 you know i- i think to be you know c[onvicted]- being convicted is one thing you know and that's and that's great if they're con[victed]- if they're sentenced to death
sw2488B-ms98-a-0044 169.780500 176.469875 to me you could not sentence them_1 to death unless the case was for sure i mean it ha[d]-
sw2488B-ms98-a-0045 176.469875 182.436500 right right an[d]- and by the time it gets there and they've been convicted and then they've been sentenced to death
sw2488B-ms98-a-0046 182.436500 194.713750 they're sure i mean there's no doubt i mean i there can be no shadow of a doubt in my mind there has to be no shadow of a doubt to get that penalty so once they've gotten the penalty and there is no doubt do it
sw2488B-ms98-a-0047 194.713750 196.101375 you know just
sw2488B-ms98-a-0048 196.101375 204.636625 i don['t]- i guess i mean that's may sound that sounds cold but gosh you know we're keeping you know we're we're keeping these men in prison for fifteen or twenty years on death row
sw2488B-ms98-a-0049 204.636625 210.095125 and not doing anything with them and it's costing us a heck of a lot of money and that's terrible to look at it that way but

sw2488B-ms98-a-0091 401.669500 411.836000 and she didn't act like it bothered her at all oh this happens all the time and we walked through the fence out the alleys or come to the back of the house you know and walked and i looked down both directions of the alley and i saw neither one of them and uh
sw2488B-ms98-a-0092 411.836000 424.352375 and oh and she was like oh God he does this all the time you know where are you you know screaming J D and you know my heart was in my throat you know and uh he Brian was two houses down

sw2488B-ms98-a-0098 452.050125 462.901125 there's two gates that go into the back yard and we've got one of those big eight foot privacy fences and one of the gates has a padlock on it and then the other gate just has one of those slide bar things but it's on the inside it's
sw2488B-ms98-a-0099 462.901125 476.927125 you know you'd have to cli[mb]- like come over they'd have to come over the fence they could not open a gate you know and i still feel a little uneasy about him playing back there you know i mean if i don't hear him playing i mean i- i get up and come out and look out the window real often you know so
sw2488B-ms98-a-0100 476.927125 482.975125 it's really scary that you have to be that scared about your kids but i mean you do better safe than sorry

sw2488B-ms98-a-0102 485.192625 493.604750 he could fry yes to put it very bluntly he could fry yes yes because sometimes there are crimes worse than murder
sw2488B-ms98-a-0103 493.604750 499.167500 you know i and i believe that and this is one of them because_1 these little girls will never be the same
sw2488B-ms98-a-0104 499.167500 505.769000 never be the same so [noise] i don't know it's [noise] it's really scary and i don't know what to
sw2488B-ms98-a-0105 505.769000 516.972750 and i don't know what needs to be done you know it seems like there's no room in jails to put them_1 in jail and when they do put them_1 in there you know we[re]- i'm taking a business law class at night and the guy that teaches it is a practicing criminal attorney and
sw2488B-ms98-a-0106 516.972750 530.468125 so he comes in and tell us all these bizarre cases you know [noise] and he said you can pretty much you know if you ever get on a jury you know you're not told this but if you ever get on a jury you can pretty much guess whatever you sentence them to they're going to serve about a quarter
sw2488B-ms98-a-0107 530.468125 543.024125 the[y]- they'll serve they'll serve a quarter of it so if you want them to stay in prison for fifteen years don't sentence them to fifteen years sentence them to a hundred you know because then they'll serve fifteen or twenty so which is really i don't know
sw2488B-ms98-a-0108 543.024125 544.522875 [silence]

sw2488B-ms98-a-0115 556.496625 561.778125 that's the thing and you know we're just going to have to adopt a [vocalized-noise] a completely different attitude
sw2488B-ms98-a-0116 561.778125 570.100625 and we're going to have to say if you commit this crime and if we're sure you commit this crime you are going to be sentenced to death period
sw2488B-ms98-a-0117 570.100625 584.042750 period and do it you know and if you commit this crime you will be in prison for the rest of your life we're not going to say we're going to put you there for the rest of your life and let you out in fifteen years we're really going to do it you know it's just the system has just
sw2488B-ms98-a-0118 584.042750 594.014125 an[d]- and i understand they're doing it because the prisons are full but somewhere we've got to come up with some money to build to build more you know and keep these people in them_1 you know
sw2488B-ms98-a-0119 594.014125 600.199000 they were i was watching a show about this the other night and you know they were like in i think it was on Forty Eight Hours or Mor[ning]-
