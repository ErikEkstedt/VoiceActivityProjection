sw2413B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 4.713000 [silence]
sw2413B-ms98-a-0002 4.713000 18.856000 well the one i think is interesting is the California Los Angeles police chief who says he wants to -[re]sign and did you hear yesterday that Mayor Bradley said that uh he should
sw2413B-ms98-a-0003 18.856000 28.739250 think it i think what's interesting is that uh uh the political activists Jesse Jackson and a lot of other people went out there and are demonstrating
sw2413B-ms98-a-0004 28.739250 37.055750 i find it interesting that uh outsiders would bother to go in how do how do you feel about people like Jesse Jackson getting involved
sw2413B-ms98-a-0005 37.055750 46.601125 [silence]
sw2413B-ms98-a-0006 46.601125 48.095750 [vocalized-noise]
sw2413B-ms98-a-0007 48.095750 55.392875 [silence]
sw2413B-ms98-a-0008 55.392875 57.803875 wha[t]- do you think Gates should resign
sw2413B-ms98-a-0009 57.803875 66.060625 [silence]
sw2413B-ms98-a-0010 66.060625 71.546500 w[ell]- w[ell]- speaking of that kind of issue have you kept up with John Wiley Price
sw2413B-ms98-a-0011 71.546500 73.292000 what do you think of him
sw2413B-ms98-a-0012 73.292000 82.244500 [silence]
sw2413B-ms98-a-0013 82.244500 87.544375 [vocalized-noise] he's an interesting person i was talking to someone who said that uh for all his
sw2413B-ms98-a-0014 87.544375 99.938375 obvious uh attention to efforts to get media attention that he actually is a worker on the uh i guess he's on the County uh
sw2413B-ms98-a-0015 99.938375 110.987875 oh Board of Supervisors or i think [vocalized-noise] and that that that uh at those meetings he really comes quite well prepared and is well informed and is a hard worker
sw2413B-ms98-a-0016 110.987875 116.684375 and is really quite agreeable uh uh and that the stuff we see in the
sw2413B-ms98-a-0017 116.684375 121.932875 you know in the media is uh well he's really just trying to make a political statement i
sw2413B-ms98-a-0018 121.932875 129.683750 i find that an interesting element of politics that we don't that that most people would not know that John Wiley Price apparently is a is a
sw2413B-ms98-a-0019 129.683750 137.795500 you know course he's got in this this deal over racism and uh you know name calling and all this but apparently he's a a worker
sw2413B-ms98-a-0020 137.795500 145.303750 uh you may disagree with him but i i i find this whole what do you think of this uh fourteen one and ten four one in Dallas
sw2413B-ms98-a-0021 145.303750 153.767250 [silence]
sw2413B-ms98-a-0022 153.767250 161.024750 i -[a]gree with you but did you see the map they drew up on uh on how they were gonna divide up the districts
sw2413B-ms98-a-0023 161.024750 172.039000 it was it was the strangest i'm i'm not sure it was gerrymandered but the way they drew these little patterns and stuff i i i guess i'm a little cynical of the of the power base
sw2413B-ms98-a-0024 172.039000 177.520500 i- i- i- and i don't quite understand why the power base uh doesn't uh
sw2413B-ms98-a-0025 177.520500 179.907750 why they don't go with fourteen one i-
sw2413B-ms98-a-0026 179.907750 181.463750 you know i-
sw2413B-ms98-a-0027 181.463750 192.297125 and you know the it seems to me that what happened in the in the election that a lot of the people they said particularly the the uh i think it's Hispanics don't vote because they don't think
sw2413B-ms98-a-0028 192.297125 201.005250 that they have any affect and it's i i guess i am disappointed with Dallas in that uh the fourteen one it
sw2413B-ms98-a-0029 201.005250 207.908250 i don't know you can you can disagree with Al Lipscomb and uh what's what's the lady's name
sw2413B-ms98-a-0030 207.908250 215.189125 yeah you can disagree with uh what they're doing and what they're saying but in reality i think they're
sw2413B-ms98-a-0031 215.189125 218.091500 they're trying to represent their constituents
sw2413B-ms98-a-0032 218.091500 223.984375 [noise] and i think Dallas is doing itself a disservice i think they ought to get on with something important
sw2413B-ms98-a-0033 223.984375 229.145500 [silence]
sw2413B-ms98-a-0034 229.145500 238.948750 yeah and i but i think even i even those people are it's like Pauken and Box and these people i think it's i find it interesting that everybody's so busy politicking that
sw2413B-ms98-a-0035 238.948750 245.048125 the question is did we get anything good done it's like this whole school issue a[re]- are you involved in the schools at all public school
sw2413B-ms98-a-0036 245.048125 249.284750 this whole thing down there where they're they're trying to um
sw2413B-ms98-a-0037 249.284750 258.666250 uh you know devote all our money and raise our taxes and better schools and and it all seems you know everybody's trying to one-upmanship on everybody else so
sw2413B-ms98-a-0038 258.666250 266.716625 i i have got to run to a meeting it's good talking to you i don't think we've gone our our ten minutes but i think we've we've talked long enough so
sw2413B-ms98-a-0039 266.716625 269.660125 [laughter-okay] good night [noise]
