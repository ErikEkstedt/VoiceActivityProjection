sw2478A-ms98-a-0013 24.629750 36.365000 [laughter] well i uh to answer that one before we get to our subject you know i always get a kick out of Republicans who take credit for all the military hardware that
sw2478A-ms98-a-0014 36.365000 50.583625 was bought for the war and how successful it was though when it comes to the budget they say well the Democrats control all the money and they're the ones wasting all the money and i always wondered how they can play the money either way they want you know i get a kick out of that but anyway the subject go ahead you first
sw2478A-ms98-a-0015 50.583625 58.459625 [silence]
sw2478A-ms98-a-0016 58.459625 67.136625 yeah i uh i don't think it's over i think that uh so many other things have taken over uh in the media
sw2478A-ms98-a-0017 67.136625 75.719750 but i think it was just plain greed and i think it was deregulation really when they said do anything you want banks go ahead loan your money out you know
sw2478A-ms98-a-0018 75.719750 84.504500 [silence]
sw2478A-ms98-a-0019 84.504500 95.894875 yeah i was talking to someone i can't remember who it was but he was a small businessman and he said that the banks were calling he borrowed some money and the banks were calling and just looking for people to give their money away
sw2478A-ms98-a-0020 95.894875 106.679625 they just got totally carried away with buying property and reselling the same property and uh yeah there there there should be thousands of people in jail as far as i'm concerned 
sw2478A-ms98-a-0021 106.679625 108.023750 not just a couple

sw2478A-ms98-a-0029 134.770000 147.575375 it may have started with HUD too i noticed that HUD was in terrible shape and that was property and uh they lost a lot of money there and then some of these big these rich people started to even uh
sw2478A-ms98-a-0030 147.575375 155.179500 Murchison here who owned the Cowboys had a lot of property down in Florida this was several years ago and he lost you know all all of his money before he died
sw2478A-ms98-a-0031 155.179500 166.672000 not all of it i don't know how much he lost but uh they were just buying property and buying all kinds of real estate and thinking that there was a bottomless pit and it always would [vocalized-noise] it always would increase you know it always would uh 
sw2478A-ms98-a-0032 166.672000 173.085375 uh be more than what you paid for it and they just never even got conservative with our money at all

sw2478A-ms98-a-0038 204.500000 216.387000 well now the reason that i said that is because i was going to blame all uh {Reaganomics} for you know you spend your way to prosperity and when you opened up the bank deregulation without any controls i thought well
sw2478A-ms98-a-0039 216.387000 224.408500 that was the philosophy you know just keep spending until taxes are lower and i thought that's not going to work you know and i knew that it wasn't going to work originally
sw2478A-ms98-a-0040 224.408500 226.421375 and it hasn't worked now you know

sw2478A-ms98-a-0067 330.415125 335.774250 spend their time here rather than produce you know and they think that well i'm paid anyway so it doesn't matter you know

sw2478A-ms98-a-0094 426.485000 440.070125 weekends and nights now i'm i'm one of the manager reps there's three of us to cover in Dallas facilities and just we're essentially standby and problems uh all all nights and weekends that's my i only get one weekend off a month right now
sw2478A-ms98-a-0095 440.070125 442.144750 i call it my recession job
sw2478A-ms98-a-0096 442.144750 451.925500 uh being [vocalized-noise] basically an engineer and liking uh doing installation work well there's not any i mean there literally is no installation work going on

sw2478A-ms98-a-0106 479.938500 492.438875 i think that not not only TI but a lot of it when they talk about uh there was one point i was going to make i think the last i heard and i i have to admit i'm not as informed uh that much but there's something like eighty six billion that they admit well i always double that i figure well 
sw2478A-ms98-a-0107 492.438875 504.632375 if they claim that it's going to cost us eighty six billion it's got to be twice as much because no one admits their mistakes and so if that's true it may mean that two hundred billion dollar category that was that went down the tube somewhere

sw2478A-ms98-a-0116 533.271500 543.444250 well we're in the metroplex here you know and uh it it i die every time companies like General Dynamics they they lost several contracts and and i don't know if you noticed yesterday
sw2478A-ms98-a-0117 543.444250 553.712750 you probably don't pay attention to the Bell Helicopter you know they were going to have this big uh award and Secorski got it which was Boeing Secorski this which is up in the north somewhere you know 
sw2478A-ms98-a-0118 553.712750 557.125750 and i don't know how Bell didn't get it

sw2478A-ms98-a-0120 559.948750 571.990500 well i i don't i they were advertising here that it was Bell TI TI was getting the uh electronics with Bell and so it was a double one that Bell is in the Metroplex and two that TI was doing the electronics for them 
sw2478A-ms98-a-0121 571.990500 581.262250 and they they uh advertised that that it was TI Bell TI Bell and then all of a sudden Secorski got it yeah Secorski Boeing Boeing doesn't need the money 
sw2478A-ms98-a-0122 581.262250 587.950250 something i almost think there's some politics around here because the metroplex here in the Dallas Fort Worth area the uh
sw2478A-ms98-a-0123 587.950250 598.107875 with TI i don't know if TI has lost as much as everybody else but General Dynamics and LTV and Bell have lost project after project you know
