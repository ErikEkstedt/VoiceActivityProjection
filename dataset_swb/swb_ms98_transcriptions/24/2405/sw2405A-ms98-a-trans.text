sw2405A-ms98-a-0014 39.614250 40.698625 [silence]

sw2405A-ms98-a-0023 64.656250 74.731750 i was amazed when i took our taxes to our tax person and she works out of her home also and the uh software that does the taxes is just incredible you know i mean she just
sw2405A-ms98-a-0024 74.731750 84.044000 you know i expected to go and you know drop the stuff off and go back two weeks later and you know she had it done and out in twenty minutes on her little PC it was great [laughter-you] [laughter-know] 
sw2405A-ms98-a-0025 84.044000 91.495375 that's wonderful i have often thought that that having one at home would be neat i just don't know if we would really use it that much you know
sw2405A-ms98-a-0026 91.495375 94.899375 [silence]
sw2405A-ms98-a-0027 94.899375 96.308875 uh-huh

sw2405A-ms98-a-0031 104.462000 112.812250 oh definitely definitely i know my stepfather bought my mother a little personal computer oh i guess probably three years ago for Christmas and
sw2405A-ms98-a-0032 112.812250 121.395250 and [vocalized-noise] you know it's got some stuff on it it's got a nice little word processing software on it you know and some budgeting type things and stuff and i don't think she's ever touched it 
sw2405A-ms98-a-0033 121.395250 132.596500 you know it just it just seems like a lot of trouble for something at home you know she always seems to have better things to do than to try to sit down and figure out how to use her computer [laughter-you] [laughter-know] so 
sw2405A-ms98-a-0034 132.596500 133.613625 [silence]
sw2405A-ms98-a-0035 133.613625 135.418000 yeah just as quickly
sw2405A-ms98-a-0036 135.418000 150.312125 now i know my boss has bought the software um that he can that hi[s]- his checkbook is on on on on on a disk and he goes in and prin[ts]- and types his checks on the screen and then hits print and they print out on the checks and 
sw2405A-ms98-a-0037 150.312125 154.240000 and he's ordered envelopes with the windows in the right places and you know 
sw2405A-ms98-a-0038 154.240000 157.231000 and he just whips out you know i saw him yesterday morning over there and
sw2405A-ms98-a-0039 157.231000 169.385250 and he paid his monthly bills and he just you know wrote all the checks on the screen and hit print and it printed out like ten checks and he just you know they're perforated and he just ripped them off they go through just a continuous thing on the printer and
sw2405A-ms98-a-0040 169.385250 177.878500 he ripped them off and stuck them in the envelopes and there they went you know and he said you know i can balance my checkbook in seconds you know because it's all in the computer you know so
sw2405A-ms98-a-0041 177.878500 178.894875 [silence]
sw2405A-ms98-a-0042 178.894875 187.141375 that's exactly right he said you know he said used to be i said i always sat looking for those you know he said this way there isn't any you know it does it for you so 
sw2405A-ms98-a-0043 187.141375 197.800250 this you know there are some definitely some some advantages to it it's just a matter of like you say are the advantages does it justify the cost if you're using it strictly for personal business so
sw2405A-ms98-a-0044 197.800250 202.848875 [silence]

sw2405A-ms98-a-0058 249.390000 260.742375 and so i'm up here you know nights and weekends you know working on the little P[C]- on the PC up here you know typing stuff so i can see where it would be a great advantage to have one at home you know if you were if you were going to school 
sw2405A-ms98-a-0059 260.742375 266.192625 [silence]
sw2405A-ms98-a-0060 266.192625 279.884750 well you i don't know i can't no no and that's they probably used to have it i just finished a a major research paper a couple of weeks ago and i couldn't imagine not having that thing on a disk where i could go back in and move stuff around and change it i 
sw2405A-ms98-a-0061 279.884750 282.739375 i don't know what they used to do [laughter] before they

sw2405A-ms98-a-0068 299.149750 300.737625 [silence]
sw2405A-ms98-a-0069 300.737625 302.897625 oh gosh
sw2405A-ms98-a-0070 302.897625 306.429375 oh cut your time in half at least
sw2405A-ms98-a-0071 306.429375 308.089250 at least
sw2405A-ms98-a-0072 308.089250 310.655875 [silence]
sw2405A-ms98-a-0073 310.655875 311.989625 yeah

sw2405A-ms98-a-0077 317.865500 319.798625 you do the whole thing over
sw2405A-ms98-a-0078 319.798625 329.143625 that's right you know i remember when i was working in high school you know i was working in an office and r[ight]- right after i got out of high school i continued working there for probably another year 
sw2405A-ms98-a-0079 329.143625 337.655500 and we did everything on a typewriter you know everything but it's amazing you know then when where you know someone would have you type a letter
sw2405A-ms98-a-0080 337.655500 348.889125 they did it right they did it right i mean they [vocalized-noise] they yeah they sit there and they go is this really what i want to say and you typed it and that was it and now you know people just send it back over and over and over and over 
sw2405A-ms98-a-0081 348.889125 353.845500 [silence]
sw2405A-ms98-a-0082 353.845500 358.288125 well we'll try this out and see what it looks like yeah yeah so 
sw2405A-ms98-a-0083 358.288125 359.987125 [silence]
sw2405A-ms98-a-0084 359.987125 373.133625 yeah instead of knowing what they want to say before they ever they just you know play with it and which in a way is nice to be able to do but you know it it gets a little out of hand sometimes i've seen it get out of hand up here you know where
sw2405A-ms98-a-0085 373.133625 383.479625 you know we've got a secretary that sits over here that's keeping metrics right now and keeping up you know of all the letters i type how many cha[nges]- how many of them do i make changes on
sw2405A-ms98-a-0086 383.479625 391.475125 and on each letter what types of changes are they typos are they because i couldn't read it or people just change a like one word because they think it sounds better or whatever
sw2405A-ms98-a-0087 391.475125 402.046125 and you know she's also keeping a percentage you know [vocalized-noise] what percentage of letters am i retyping for whatever reason and there's like one week she she did retypes on ninety percent of what she typed 
sw2405A-ms98-a-0088 402.046125 413.388375 you know and it's like you know it's ridiculous and [vocalized-noise] and that was that was the high week but it's running about seventy which is still ridiculous to have to make changes to seventy percent of everything that she types you know that's 
sw2405A-ms98-a-0089 413.388375 414.395500 [silence]
sw2405A-ms98-a-0090 414.395500 429.215500 well that's exactly right you know she keeps you know keeps several weeks' worth of data and then in addition is keeping copies of all the changes to show you know look this didn't really need to be changed you know this is this is ridiculous and you know changing the w[ord]- you know at this time to now 
sw2405A-ms98-a-0091 429.215500 438.910375 you know i mean that that's the kind of things that you know p[eople]- that she's keeping and showing you know that th[is]- this this was a big waste of time it was a waste of paper it was a waste you know to change something like that so 
sw2405A-ms98-a-0092 438.910375 450.029250 anyway maybe you know maybe it'll it'll help in some way but i don't know there there there definitely even with the few disadvantages like that are far better than the alternative
sw2405A-ms98-a-0093 450.029250 452.759375 you [laughter-know] without a doubt without a doubt
sw2405A-ms98-a-0094 452.759375 467.570625 well i would like to get one at home some day we've got a two year old son and so you know some day i would like to get even just like the video tell or something like that you know just to to be able to pull in so[urces]- sources from outside would be wonderful you know so
sw2405A-ms98-a-0095 467.570625 469.875750 [silence]
sw2405A-ms98-a-0096 469.875750 480.841875 oh i do too i do too the the on line um encyclopedia just sounds wonderful you know th[at]- that sounds like such a great idea you know it'd be nice to kind of fun to be to be able to play with it 
sw2405A-ms98-a-0097 480.841875 492.944375 so i know my father had a PC and and when we were in high school it was always fun we could um link in and i don't even remember now what it was called but you could link in and talk to other peo[ple]- talk to people all over the country you know
sw2405A-ms98-a-0098 492.944375 504.569000 and like you have your own little code name you know and you'd type in [vocalized-noise] hi how are you [vocalized-noise] and they'd type back [vocalized-noise] everything everybody and you'd have five or six or seven people talking to each other at the same time and everything everybody said 
sw2405A-ms98-a-0099 504.569000 508.595625 prints out on your screen as they're typing it and it was just great fun you know
sw2405A-ms98-a-0100 508.595625 520.277625 it was very expensive because the whole time you were on there you were on long distance you know it was like a long distance phone call so we were each limi[ted]- limited to like twenty minutes a day you know so [laughter]
sw2405A-ms98-a-0101 520.277625 533.697000 it's oh it added up big well you know we [vocalized-noise] my parents were divorced and so the time we were like visiting our father in the summer time you know so he felt like he could splurge and let us do it you know i'm sure we would not have been allowed to do that under normal situations you know 
sw2405A-ms98-a-0102 533.697000 541.719125 but when you're doing the guilty father complex you know [laughter-because] he's not there to watch us grow you can kind of you can kind of get all kinds of stuff [laughter-you] [laughter-know] 
sw2405A-ms98-a-0103 541.719125 542.894875 [silence]
sw2405A-ms98-a-0104 542.894875 545.878875 that's sad well it was nice to talk to you
sw2405A-ms98-a-0105 545.878875 547.828375 have a nice you too
