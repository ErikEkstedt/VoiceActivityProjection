sw2468A-ms98-a-0033 149.351375 156.982375 so few people voting in them_1 you know uh maybe uh fifty percent or less of the electorate have you ever thought much about it
sw2468A-ms98-a-0034 156.982375 177.910625 [silence]

sw2468A-ms98-a-0044 247.495375 257.412125 right i'm going to inject a little side anecdote for you back to the to the uh uh the main topic here because it it you might be interested in this uh you know i've i've
sw2468A-ms98-a-0045 257.412125 264.335500 uh as i mentioned i've [vocalized-noise] had seven years of ex[patriate]- expatriate service with TI and uh you vote in the embassy
sw2468A-ms98-a-0046 264.335500 269.100750 uh uh from whatever country you're in you go to the United States Embassy and vote there
sw2468A-ms98-a-0047 269.100750 280.998375 and uh i was in the Phi[llipines]- uh in Portugal not stationed there but i was i was there on business and visiting a family uh that i knew very well in fact the guy had been my boss when we were in Malaysia
sw2468A-ms98-a-0048 280.998375 295.242000 and uh it was with with TI and i went to his house for dinner and they had a young son who was probably about in the seventh grade and was attending a British school in uh uh in Portugal and this was in
sw2468A-ms98-a-0049 295.242000 308.299625 uh this was just nineteen eighty four just uh prior maybe in the summer prior to the eighty four election and i went home uh [vocalized-noise] for dinner to dinner with this fellow and they were they were Texans and uh they lived there in Portugal
sw2468A-ms98-a-0050 308.299625 317.705125 and his wife said gee the darndest thing happened today she said i'm so embarrassed she said i was over at Reed's school and Margaret Thatcher came and spoke to the
sw2468A-ms98-a-0051 317.705125 329.837500 to the uh the parents it was a British school so she was there visiting in Portugal and she visited this British school and spoke to parents and after it was over she said i went up to her and i said Mrs Thatcher i'm a great admirer of yours
sw2468A-ms98-a-0052 329.837500 335.816250 and she said what i wanted to uh uh i've always wanted to meet you and i've enjoyed this opportunity to meet you
sw2468A-ms98-a-0053 335.816250 346.999625 and uh Margaret Thatcher said oh you're you're an American yes she said well something i want to ask you about she said when you're American and away from home in an election year like this how do you vote
sw2468A-ms98-a-0054 346.999625 351.539000 and and my friend said oh if nothing changes i'll vote for Reagan
sw2468A-ms98-a-0055 351.539000 357.695375 and she said oh my goodness no i didn't mean that and poor Janet realized immediately she didn't mean that she meant what was the process of voting
sw2468A-ms98-a-0056 357.695375 367.291500 and Margaret Thatcher was embarrassed that Janet would think that she was going to ask her [laughter-how] [laughter-she] [laughter-was] [laughter-going] [laughter-to] [laughter-vote] [laughter-and] [laughter-it] [laughter-was] [laughter-so] [laughter-funny] and her husband kept looking at her and said i can't believe you could be so dumb [laughter]
sw2468A-ms98-a-0057 367.291500 376.109250 but uh i it's it's interesting though people that do we've had noticed we had been uh uh in Malaysia during one election year and the Philippines in another
sw2468A-ms98-a-0058 376.109250 389.700500 that there seems to be a higher percent of the expatriate population i mean well over fifty percent that do bother to to register with the embassy and go vote you'd almost think that you think you're more important when you're out of the country and you're exposed to some things
sw2468A-ms98-a-0059 389.700500 394.486500 [silence]
sw2468A-ms98-a-0060 394.486500 395.742250 um-hum
sw2468A-ms98-a-0061 395.742250 398.487125 [silence]
sw2468A-ms98-a-0062 398.487125 399.991375 yeah
sw2468A-ms98-a-0063 399.991375 409.490000 [silence]
sw2468A-ms98-a-0064 409.490000 411.955000 true
sw2468A-ms98-a-0065 411.955000 454.453250 [silence]
sw2468A-ms98-a-0066 454.453250 460.577125 that's exactly right and they don't realize that that it's all {onesies} and the {onesies} all add up
sw2468A-ms98-a-0067 460.577125 473.629500 you know the thing that that i [vocalized-noise] surprised me even more you know if we got a good contest going uh we do manage to get fifty percent out in national elections and uh but what's even worse is the off year congressional elections
sw2468A-ms98-a-0068 473.629500 487.491250 uh when there's not a presidential election uh and the local election and it bothers me and i- i think that's even more important to vote in those because uh oh sure and
sw2468A-ms98-a-0069 487.491250 502.321500 yeah and it's it's like a school board election you know those of us with children in school are very concerned about what goes on uh in the school system yet uh school board members are elected with sometimes ten to fifteen percent of the electorate turning out
sw2468A-ms98-a-0070 502.321500 515.901250 an[d]- yeah and and you know the one of the things that i can still remember a college professor standing up pointing his pipe at a class one day while he was lecturing and he said the problem of the vote is that the American
sw2468A-ms98-a-0071 515.901250 524.816250 uh public is sometimes asked to go to the polls too often and to make too many and too difficult decisions and i think of that every time i go find one of these ballots
sw2468A-ms98-a-0072 524.816250 533.991250 and you not only get it in the presidential year uh where where you go down through eight or nine judgeships [laughter] and uh uh
sw2468A-ms98-a-0073 533.991250 535.275625 [silence]
sw2468A-ms98-a-0074 535.275625 536.493875 what
sw2468A-ms98-a-0075 536.493875 540.751875 oh yeah it it still is your responsibility
sw2468A-ms98-a-0076 540.751875 551.997875 [silence]
sw2468A-ms98-a-0077 551.997875 553.477625 right
sw2468A-ms98-a-0078 553.477625 571.711500 [silence]
sw2468A-ms98-a-0079 571.711500 577.483375 yeah i yeah i- i- i think you're right there and i'm glad you mentioned the League of Women Voters i've
sw2468A-ms98-a-0080 577.483375 584.326875 [vocalized-noise] i don't know how long they've been around maybe a long time but it's only in my more mature years that i have become aware of them
sw2468A-ms98-a-0081 584.326875 590.307750 and and i make a real effort to go out and read all and particularly read their things about
sw2468A-ms98-a-0082 590.307750 599.434375 the candidates for lesser offices that you don't you can't read their view in the paper uh and i- i think that is tremendously important and
