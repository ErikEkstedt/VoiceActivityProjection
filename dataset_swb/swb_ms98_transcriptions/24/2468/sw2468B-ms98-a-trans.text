sw2468B-ms98-a-0053 387.262625 394.791250 i think i think sometimes that you um you pick you become more aware of what you have
sw2468B-ms98-a-0054 394.791250 409.717375 and how important it is to you you become more [vocalized-noise] loyal so to speak to to the things that you don't have at that time and you realize hey my you know we really have a good thing there so i think you hold more dear the things like democracy and your rights
sw2468B-ms98-a-0055 409.717375 417.277375 you know as a an American citizen but i think uh the people that i've talked to as far as voting because_1 i've worked you know in in
sw2468B-ms98-a-0056 417.277375 428.998000 trying to get people to vote when i was in the military i was a uh represented you know i represented [vocalized-noise] people as far as voting and um from what i spoke [vocalized-noise] speaking with people it was
sw2468B-ms98-a-0057 428.998000 436.997500 mainly that um they felt frustrated that their one vote wasn't going to do any good you know that um
sw2468B-ms98-a-0058 436.997500 449.277875 and and it was really hard to get across to them that it didn't matter you know it's a matter of that's your right you should go and do it you know and that your one vote can count when you get a whole lot of peop[le]-
sw2468B-ms98-a-0059 449.277875 456.977375 if everybody says oh well my vote doesn't count you know then then what do you have you know
