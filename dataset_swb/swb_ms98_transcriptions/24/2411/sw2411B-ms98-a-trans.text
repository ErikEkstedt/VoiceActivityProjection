sw2411B-ms98-a-0132 357.759375 362.096125 i've watched them twice and they look like bumbling idiots out there at times
sw2411B-ms98-a-0133 362.096125 365.138750 uh they don't look like they know what they're doing
sw2411B-ms98-a-0134 365.138750 367.231125 and i know they do
sw2411B-ms98-a-0135 367.231125 369.363625 they've got to know
sw2411B-ms98-a-0136 369.363625 374.953250 but i watched them when they was playing that team over there in New England i think is where it was and uh
sw2411B-ms98-a-0137 374.953250 376.967750 last week i watched them play
sw2411B-ms98-a-0138 376.967750 379.571500 and they just they looked terrible
sw2411B-ms98-a-0139 379.571500 380.573000 [silence]
sw2411B-ms98-a-0140 380.573000 384.237125 but they got the the NFL backing them so they might make it

sw2411B-ms98-a-0144 390.611500 396.603125 yeah well well uh that's how i got to liking Doug Flutie he was playing for the Generals
sw2411B-ms98-a-0145 396.603125 399.973125 on uh the uh USFL
sw2411B-ms98-a-0146 399.973125 404.438500 and down in Memphis they had a uh team called the Showboats
sw2411B-ms98-a-0147 404.438500 409.679125 and uh you know i didn't care for the Showboats much but i did like a couple of their players
sw2411B-ms98-a-0148 409.679125 414.509125 uh and a couple of them even went to the uh NFL i just don't remember their names
sw2411B-ms98-a-0149 414.509125 418.540125 uh Doug Flutie's the only one that sticks out in my head for some reason
sw2411B-ms98-a-0150 418.540125 423.716625 uh i think that's because of what Ditka done to him that just put it in my head and kept it there

sw2411B-ms98-a-0154 433.554250 438.009500 yeah well i that the London Knights i think is who it is
sw2411B-ms98-a-0155 438.009500 440.884875 uh they were a fairly decent looking team
sw2411B-ms98-a-0156 440.884875 443.365375 they take the football serious
sw2411B-ms98-a-0157 443.365375 447.296875 uh shoot i don't remember remember what the score
