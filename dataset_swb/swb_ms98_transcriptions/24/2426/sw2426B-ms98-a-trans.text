sw2426B-ms98-a-0005 8.588875 22.753750 [silence]
sw2426B-ms98-a-0006 22.753750 28.376125 uh well [noise] uh just really the last couple of days since this uh the UN
sw2426B-ms98-a-0007 28.376125 31.330125 debate or whatever you want to call it that uh
sw2426B-ms98-a-0008 31.330125 34.891000 voted on whether there was going to be a cease fire i guess
sw2426B-ms98-a-0009 34.891000 38.442875 you know the thing really isn't over they uh
sw2426B-ms98-a-0010 38.442875 44.223625 they had uh kind of uh i don't know if you call it stand down or whatever but anyway they stopped
sw2426B-ms98-a-0011 44.223625 49.295000 and wait to see if Iraq would accept a a permanent cease fire situation though
sw2426B-ms98-a-0012 49.295000 55.001500 as i understand it from the Iraqi point of view this current cease fire thing that the UN uh
sw2426B-ms98-a-0013 55.001500 62.260000 uh had uh set up you know the Iraqis are probably not going to go for at all unless they're just absolutely forced to
sw2426B-ms98-a-0014 62.260000 65.614875 so i guess from what i understand the thing could just
sw2426B-ms98-a-0015 65.614875 69.279375 they could just t[ake]- they could take off at any moment without uh
sw2426B-ms98-a-0016 69.279375 70.634125 you know any
sw2426B-ms98-a-0017 70.634125 73.966875 uh-huh you know any local um
sw2426B-ms98-a-0018 73.966875 78.251875 you know congressional effort or anything else because you know it's not really settled yet
sw2426B-ms98-a-0019 78.251875 79.933625 [silence]
sw2426B-ms98-a-0020 79.933625 82.449500 not yet not yet at all
sw2426B-ms98-a-0021 82.449500 96.577000 [silence]
sw2426B-ms98-a-0022 96.577000 97.850375 uh-huh
sw2426B-ms98-a-0023 97.850375 103.922625 [silence]
sw2426B-ms98-a-0024 103.922625 105.828500 no
sw2426B-ms98-a-0025 105.828500 109.507250 yeah i don't know why they expect it's going to start this week you know
sw2426B-ms98-a-0026 109.507250 110.199750 [laughter]
sw2426B-ms98-a-0027 110.199750 117.979250 [silence]
sw2426B-ms98-a-0028 117.979250 119.423625 uh-huh
sw2426B-ms98-a-0029 119.423625 124.622625 [silence]
sw2426B-ms98-a-0030 124.622625 130.644625 yeah the uh the thing that's kind of interesting uh about this my sons in the Air Force
sw2426B-ms98-a-0031 130.644625 138.934125 and uh he came within about a quarter of an inch of going uh to Saudi he ended up in Korea instead and because of the way they split a transportation group out in Lubbock
sw2426B-ms98-a-0032 138.934125 142.502875 so he ended up going to Korea but his buddies ended up going to Saudi
sw2426B-ms98-a-0033 142.502875 150.044750 well he's still in Korea and his buddies are home now [laughter] he he almost wishes that that he could have gone home
sw2426B-ms98-a-0034 150.044750 151.110000 [silence]
sw2426B-ms98-a-0035 151.110000 152.395250 yeah
sw2426B-ms98-a-0036 152.395250 159.164250 [silence]
sw2426B-ms98-a-0037 159.164250 160.525250 uh-huh
sw2426B-ms98-a-0038 160.525250 163.462000 [silence]
sw2426B-ms98-a-0039 163.462000 171.288750 yeah the thing uh the other thing too when this all started if you you know if you did much reading on the thing you know Kuwait
sw2426B-ms98-a-0040 171.288750 175.124750 the country of Kuwait was just you know somebody's
sw2426B-ms98-a-0041 175.124750 179.887875 uh you know you go back to World War i when the uh Ottoman empire broke up
sw2426B-ms98-a-0042 179.887875 184.230750 and the British and the French and the Eng[lish]- yeah the British and the French mostly
sw2426B-ms98-a-0043 184.230750 195.388500 decided to carve up that part of the world and call part of it Persia and part of it uh Iraq and part of it something else you know and they they split things along um
sw2426B-ms98-a-0044 195.388500 199.682125 geographical lines but they didn't take any kind of consideration into uh
sw2426B-ms98-a-0045 199.682125 201.401625 social or cultural
sw2426B-ms98-a-0046 201.401625 207.968000 things at all so the country of uh of Kuwait really doesn't make just a whole lot of sense
sw2426B-ms98-a-0047 207.968000 210.918500 except that it is an accepted
sw2426B-ms98-a-0048 210.918500 214.874875 place you know it's like any other country you know for whatever reason it's
sw2426B-ms98-a-0049 214.874875 220.499750 it's actually there well Iraq has had uh designs on that place since nineteen twenty two
sw2426B-ms98-a-0050 220.499750 224.018625 so you know it wasn't like something that just suddenly popped up
sw2426B-ms98-a-0051 224.018625 226.743000 and it's just that this was an excuse
sw2426B-ms98-a-0052 226.743000 235.208375 you know to to make some noise now something that i read in the paper the other day that i thought was kind of interesting was that the Arab
sw2426B-ms98-a-0053 235.208375 236.675250 uh
sw2426B-ms98-a-0054 236.675250 250.259375 uh their version or vision or whatever the United States now is somewhat changed in that we won you know now now we are a uh you know a legitimate player in the game over there you know the
sw2426B-ms98-a-0055 250.259375 256.492125 we i don't think we can really understand their attitude because their culture's just so much different but uh
sw2426B-ms98-a-0056 256.492125 260.891250 uh we are now a legitimate player in the
sw2426B-ms98-a-0057 260.891250 265.745625 in the in the game because we came in with a certain amount of force and we
sw2426B-ms98-a-0058 265.745625 267.518125 you know we defeated
sw2426B-ms98-a-0059 267.518125 274.816750 you know Iran couldn't do it in seven years and we went in and did in in seven days what Iran couldn't do in seven years you know so
sw2426B-ms98-a-0060 274.816750 279.754875 that kind of ups our stock in there just a little bit it makes us more legitimate
sw2426B-ms98-a-0061 279.754875 290.340750 so now what they're saying is that well since we won whatever we say goes because it's a a kind of a a might makes right sort of attitude about it and you know we've got the power
sw2426B-ms98-a-0062 290.340750 291.700625 yeah
sw2426B-ms98-a-0063 291.700625 299.963250 which is why for centuries you know hundreds of years the British and the the French had so much influence in there because they'd go in and they'd win something
sw2426B-ms98-a-0064 299.963250 302.999500 and then and then they could call the shots for the next
sw2426B-ms98-a-0065 302.999500 307.040250 you know period of time until the next strong man came up and you know and
sw2426B-ms98-a-0066 307.040250 308.820500 caused problems so
sw2426B-ms98-a-0067 308.820500 315.314000 [silence]
sw2426B-ms98-a-0068 315.314000 316.983500 yeah yeah
sw2426B-ms98-a-0069 316.983500 323.470000 [silence]
sw2426B-ms98-a-0070 323.470000 324.712125 uh-huh
sw2426B-ms98-a-0071 324.712125 335.313250 [silence]
sw2426B-ms98-a-0072 335.313250 336.594875 yeah
sw2426B-ms98-a-0073 336.594875 345.366500 [silence]
sw2426B-ms98-a-0074 345.366500 346.626500 yeah
sw2426B-ms98-a-0075 346.626500 349.001000 [silence]
sw2426B-ms98-a-0076 349.001000 351.341125 yeah that's that's the uh
sw2426B-ms98-a-0077 351.341125 355.068625 that's that's the big thing you know we still got a little bit of the old
sw2426B-ms98-a-0078 355.068625 358.302750 you know Vietnam um
sw2426B-ms98-a-0079 358.302750 364.464375 problem in you know in the back of our minds we we got this we're we're used to wars where you can get in do the job and get out
sw2426B-ms98-a-0080 364.464375 369.825625 Vietnam we never did get out you know never did get the job done because they were too ham strung
sw2426B-ms98-a-0081 369.825625 375.167875 uh this thing they they gave the guys uh the power and the material and the
sw2426B-ms98-a-0082 375.167875 384.828625 told them to go do it and they did it you know got in and got out i'm not sure the the big fuss that we're going to see now for the next few weeks i would think
sw2426B-ms98-a-0083 384.828625 396.921000 is uh you know the uh the business with the uh the Shiites of all people you know in the southern part of the country and also the Kurds because these people evidently are you know being killed off by the thousands
sw2426B-ms98-a-0084 396.921000 406.037875 and whether the the United Nations i don't think the US will do it on their own but whether the United Nations comes around and says hey wait a minute we know this thing isn't
sw2426B-ms98-a-0085 406.037875 413.515500 uh all that much over we've got to go back in there and and be sure that this large population isn't just wiped out
sw2426B-ms98-a-0086 413.515500 417.199000 which is seems to be exactly what's happening right at the moment
sw2426B-ms98-a-0087 417.199000 420.347875 but uh you know
sw2426B-ms98-a-0088 420.347875 422.820625 [silence]
sw2426B-ms98-a-0089 422.820625 433.363125 oh well no no there there never will be i mean uh uh the only way that you're going to have peace over there if if we determine that we want to go in and wipe out every last one of them
sw2426B-ms98-a-0090 433.363125 438.965250 you know until we make a decision to do that there won't be peace but i don't think we want to make that decision either
sw2426B-ms98-a-0091 438.965250 444.029500 so that's that's a little rough you know we're not we're not quite up to that sort of thing
sw2426B-ms98-a-0092 444.029500 445.725125 so
sw2426B-ms98-a-0093 445.725125 449.065875 yeah
sw2426B-ms98-a-0094 449.065875 451.004250 oh [laughter]
sw2426B-ms98-a-0095 451.004250 453.749375 oh well that's that's fun 
sw2426B-ms98-a-0096 453.749375 455.415500 [silence]
sw2426B-ms98-a-0097 455.415500 457.281625 you too bye bye
