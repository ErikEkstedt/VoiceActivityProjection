sw2469B-ms98-a-0036 161.023750 166.074000 yeah the first proj[ect]- project i started out one was a big one it was uh
sw2469B-ms98-a-0037 166.074000 170.425500 it was of a lady and she was kneeling and it was about
sw2469B-ms98-a-0038 170.425500 172.784250 fifteen by twenty maybe
sw2469B-ms98-a-0039 172.784250 186.100625 and i it was just too much to start with and i still haven't finished it because i s[topped]- i stopped and i thought well i better do some simple things and work up to [laughter-this] because_1 it was just so difficult to to get it done and there were so many different shadings and colors and
sw2469B-ms98-a-0040 186.100625 192.854875 and uh i[t]- it was just too much to begin with and i think that kind of discouraged me from doing much more [laughter-with] it
sw2469B-ms98-a-0041 192.854875 197.607500 [laughter] and i've done some of the crewel and the um
sw2469B-ms98-a-0042 197.607500 207.745500 something similar to that but it doesn't have the specific stitches anyway it's a little bit more loose and not uh quite as structured and i like that a little bit better the variety of stitches and stuff in that
sw2469B-ms98-a-0043 207.745500 210.170625 more like embroidery or something

sw2469B-ms98-a-0081 381.200375 389.315875 i think it would be nice to just go out and pick some tomatoes off the porch we get lots of sunlight here and the porch is screened in and it's pretty large
sw2469B-ms98-a-0082 389.315875 390.992875 so um

sw2469B-ms98-a-0106 486.820625 491.024375 something small that she can watch but won't take too much care
