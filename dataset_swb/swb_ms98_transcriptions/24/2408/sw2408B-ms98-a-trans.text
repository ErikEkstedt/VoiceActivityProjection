sw2408B-ms98-a-0051 266.224750 270.499625 i'm just uh it irritates me the way people
sw2408B-ms98-a-0052 270.499625 279.672000 mistreat animals and and they don't do it intentionally they just they're just doing it they go out and they think oh wouldn't it be cute to get a kitty 
sw2408B-ms98-a-0053 279.672000 287.478375 and they go out and they don't have it fixed or anything and it has kittens and they can't support it and they take them down there and they end up getting
sw2408B-ms98-a-0054 287.478375 301.952875 or move off and leave them_1 and they they end i don't know where this o[ne]- th[e]- my next door neighbor had a had a dead cat next to his front porch yeah i'd seen the cat around here before i thought it belonged to somebody but i have no idea what killed it

sw2408B-ms98-a-0056 303.006625 315.242500 it might have been might have gotten hold of something bad or i[t]- we had a cold snap here not too long ago it may have frozen out there i i sort of doubt it cats know how to take care of themselves
sw2408B-ms98-a-0057 315.242500 324.466000 yeah well this this one was definitely outdoor cat because_1 i saw him all the time and i suspect somebody had just had him and moved off
sw2408B-ms98-a-0058 324.466000 329.447875 i[t's]- it's sad i mean and they do it to dogs
sw2408B-ms98-a-0059 329.447875 343.755250 the last dog i got i think was that way because_1 he was uh he was in fairly good shape but apparently just didn't have a home or couldn't find his way home and i don't believe it because he was one smart dog strange mixture he was uh
sw2408B-ms98-a-0060 343.755250 349.240625 the best i can figure he was part Lab because he had a Lab head
sw2408B-ms98-a-0061 349.240625 359.805750 uh and definitely part Gray[hound]- uh bloodhound because_1 he had these h[ead]- big old jowls had the bloodhound mouth but he had the soft bite of a Lab
sw2408B-ms98-a-0062 359.805750 367.477875 and he was the smartest dog i've ever seen he just i could talk to him and he knew what i was saying

sw2408B-ms98-a-0068 399.965000 406.977750 yeah oh i ended up getting her a six foot two by four and let and she had the best time with it
sw2408B-ms98-a-0069 406.977750 416.484750 she'd grab that thing in the middle and it was just about as heavy as she was and she'd drag that thing around the yard [laughter] she was a sight to behold
