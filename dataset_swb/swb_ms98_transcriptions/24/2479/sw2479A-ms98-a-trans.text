sw2479A-ms98-a-0052 138.972375 148.930750 or she's i guess yeah it's was about ten years so i yeah i was real[ly]- i was really happy that i was able to do that but i that's what i wanted to because i uh 
sw2479A-ms98-a-0053 148.930750 163.578000 you know i just couldn't wait to have kids and so if i was i was so anxious to have them and i couldn't wait to have them it would be kind of silly you know to go back to work as soon as i had them so so it it it it was really great by the end of the ten years i was really ready [laughter]
sw2479A-ms98-a-0054 163.578000 172.405000 to go back to work and my youngest was only uh two and a half i mean she was already two and a half so it wasn't you know she wasn't an infant
sw2479A-ms98-a-0055 172.405000 183.721750 yeah yeah so i felt real good about that but uh boy i tell you with summer coming up i'm just pulling my hair out in terms of what i'm going to do i i i guess i went back to work about a year and a half ago 
sw2479A-ms98-a-0056 183.721750 198.192125 and uh i worked full time all last year and now i'm going to school part time and uh graduate school and i'm working part time and so i'm still yeah i'm still going full time but i only have half time salary
sw2479A-ms98-a-0057 198.192125 205.909875 and uh when school lets out i just don't i haven't i have no idea what i'm going to do because i certainly can't afford what we did last year
sw2479A-ms98-a-0058 205.909875 207.536500 which was
sw2479A-ms98-a-0059 207.536500 215.528500 well we did we tried we had all different things we sent them to camp one first month in June they went to summer school then the second month they
sw2479A-ms98-a-0060 215.528500 223.158500 uh one my daughter went home to visit my Mom for a while and my son uh went to camp and there we had uh i don't know some
sw2479A-ms98-a-0061 223.158500 228.263625 forget what else we did but it was all uh really [laughter-expensive] 
sw2479A-ms98-a-0062 228.263625 236.897000 so now they're a year older and i my daughter's eleven going to be eleven this summer and my son will be nine and a half
sw2479A-ms98-a-0063 236.897000 246.422750 and so i'm not i think i can leave them home for a if i can work part of the day you know i'm going to leave them home right
sw2479A-ms98-a-0064 246.422750 253.526250 right yes [vocalized-noise] in fact [vocalized-noise] i'm doing that right now with their afternoons when they get home before i do 
sw2479A-ms98-a-0065 253.526250 261.836250 you know that's okay but the four year old now i have i have had her since i went back to work or before i went back to work really in a home day care
sw2479A-ms98-a-0066 261.836250 270.368750 situation and uh we've just been really thrilled with it too we were luck[y]- actually we it took us two or three different people to find 
sw2479A-ms98-a-0067 270.368750 283.849125 yeah right but i wasn't embarrassed to shop around you know so the the the person we found it through the there's an association here in town of professional home care providers or something like that in Plano 
sw2479A-ms98-a-0068 283.849125 294.280125 yeah and they have a number you can call and all these people are registered with their association and you know go like our our uh
sw2479A-ms98-a-0069 294.280125 297.570000 i don't want to call her a baby sitter she's doesn't [laughter-like] [laughter-to] [laughter-be] [laughter-called] [laughter-that] 
sw2479A-ms98-a-0070 297.570000 299.145625 care provider
sw2479A-ms98-a-0071 299.145625 310.745250 right she goes to seminars and uh she gets home visitations by this s[tate]- uh uh i don't know state boards i guess some of them and then some by the association and they 
sw2479A-ms98-a-0072 310.745250 315.995125 have weekly meetings and everything and so it's just really really well regulated
sw2479A-ms98-a-0073 315.995125 320.421500 and she's just great in fact uh she's all upset because Galen is going to go to
sw2479A-ms98-a-0074 320.421500 333.239250 kindergarten next fall and she says this is it you know i'm not going to have her anymore and i said oh no don't count on that [laughter] after noon classes she's going to be here because she's going to morning kindergarten so
sw2479A-ms98-a-0075 333.239250 341.985250 but we've we've tried we've tried everything and one year [vocalized-noise] i guess last year when i went back to work i had my son was 
sw2479A-ms98-a-0076 341.985250 348.739375 eight at the time just barely eight and uh we put him in Amrein's Day Care after
sw2479A-ms98-a-0077 348.739375 349.952875 afterward 
sw2479A-ms98-a-0078 349.952875 358.658375 well that's why we picked it because they were were supposed to be real great and you know i think they were fine but the the thing is he was in school all day 
sw2479A-ms98-a-0079 358.658375 366.343875 in second grade in in Plano it's open classroom situation where they don't have walls so there is like a hundred and twenty second graders [laughter]
sw2479A-ms98-a-0080 366.343875 370.173750 in the same area with no walls and uh
sw2479A-ms98-a-0081 370.173750 373.644375 and then he'd get on the Amrein's Bus to go to Amrein's
sw2479A-ms98-a-0082 373.644375 386.810125 and then there would be a whole ton of other kids all in the same room you know and i[ts]- you know what having fun they had with these computer games and then they'd go outside for awhile they had snacks and story time and everything but it was just like going to school until five thirty at night 
sw2479A-ms98-a-0083 386.810125 397.994000 instead of being able to get home at two thirty yeah because he was around with a crowd of kids and he just really missed being able to be by himself and having some [noise] peace and quiet or you know 
sw2479A-ms98-a-0084 397.994000 399.324125 yes
