sw2433A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 6.957625 well ironically enough i'm sitting here with a cast on my leg because i resumed an aerobics class the night before [laughter-last]
sw2433A-ms98-a-0002 6.957625 9.797875 i ripped the ligaments in my right ankle
sw2433A-ms98-a-0003 9.797875 12.031875 yeah so
sw2433A-ms98-a-0004 12.031875 16.489125 that's what the nurses kept saying as they laughed all the way you know down the hallway
sw2433A-ms98-a-0005 16.489125 19.901000 [laughter] do you do anything on a regular basis
sw2433A-ms98-a-0006 19.901000 27.184375 [silence]
sw2433A-ms98-a-0007 27.184375 31.618875 yeah that's a good yeah my husband's a TIer in the house unit here
sw2433A-ms98-a-0008 31.618875 36.690375 [silence]
sw2433A-ms98-a-0009 36.690375 42.043000 do you when you go to the Texans i have to ask you and if this is getting to [vocalized-noise] we're not supposed to get too particular but i'm just curious
sw2433A-ms98-a-0010 42.043000 52.411125 when you go over there does it bother you in terms of how things are arranged either at the Dallas location or the Spring Creek in terms of there's so much it's so much of a weight orientation weight lifting et cetera
sw2433A-ms98-a-0011 52.411125 56.929500 [silence]
sw2433A-ms98-a-0012 56.929500 58.105000 uh-huh
sw2433A-ms98-a-0013 58.105000 60.509750 [silence]
sw2433A-ms98-a-0014 60.509750 71.636875 yeah it['s]- well it's not that great and i go to the Spring Creek one on and off but my husband's working over there and he just goes to the Dallas one but i just don't i mean i just it's so much weight lifting even the Spring Creek one has a lot of weights in it
sw2433A-ms98-a-0015 71.636875 73.806500 or is that what your into or
sw2433A-ms98-a-0016 73.806500 76.457000 [silence]
sw2433A-ms98-a-0017 76.457000 77.532875 uh-huh
sw2433A-ms98-a-0018 77.532875 80.702250 [silence]
sw2433A-ms98-a-0019 80.702250 81.868625 yeah
sw2433A-ms98-a-0020 81.868625 83.616750 [silence]
sw2433A-ms98-a-0021 83.616750 87.486875 i like the tread mill and the stair master myself over there
sw2433A-ms98-a-0022 87.486875 89.351250 and the pool when it gets warmer
sw2433A-ms98-a-0023 89.351250 94.387500 yeah [laughter] i know well what i did was i went to a {jazzercise} class
sw2433A-ms98-a-0024 94.387500 98.990750 in a a new location in Richardson near where we live in North Dallas and
sw2433A-ms98-a-0025 98.990750 110.140875 long story short i hadn't this is really a stupid thing that happened but they have like the gymnasium flooring and then like they had like about three feet of linoleum around the perimeter in the back where i usually stand
sw2433A-ms98-a-0026 110.140875 114.185875 in any class like that i go to instead of having that level you know
sw2433A-ms98-a-0027 114.185875 122.248875 they had a chrome strip that wasn't level and it was about four inches deep and then about a oh a seventy degree angle
sw2433A-ms98-a-0028 122.248875 126.797250 and as we were jumping around or doing something i just jumped up and came right down on it
sw2433A-ms98-a-0029 126.797250 133.462625 [vocalized-noise] the orthopedist called it a uh basketball injury where the ankle just rolls under you and it snapped [laughter]
sw2433A-ms98-a-0030 133.462625 141.825625 i know we went to uh HDA we[ll]- well whatever HDA Plano and the emergency room was like a bad comedy [laughter-show]
sw2433A-ms98-a-0031 141.825625 156.250625 [laughter] and the doctor said you didn't do anything there's only a one in five hundred chance that the radiologist will call you that was Tuesday night and Wednesday night the radiologist called me at work and uh i was on crutches and he said i think you better call an orthopedist
sw2433A-ms98-a-0032 156.250625 160.531125 so we went to one and he just put a big old cast on it
sw2433A-ms98-a-0033 160.531125 162.769875 yeah for about four weeks
sw2433A-ms98-a-0034 162.769875 164.471250 [silence]
sw2433A-ms98-a-0035 164.471250 166.912125 so i mean i like aerobics but i'm not so sure [vocalized-noise]
sw2433A-ms98-a-0036 166.912125 167.932875 [silence]
sw2433A-ms98-a-0037 167.932875 176.265250 no i've never i was off for about six months too just for some other surgery i'd had but i've never i'd you know i was pretty much in shape walking and
sw2433A-ms98-a-0038 176.265250 184.169375 and you know this is one of those things like this orthopedist said he said you'd be surprised how many basket[ball]- how many people come in here with things like that because they are active
sw2433A-ms98-a-0039 184.169375 189.004125 you know i was real embarrassed but i felt kind of [laughter-stupid]
sw2433A-ms98-a-0040 189.004125 195.826500 yeah they do i mean i guess i'm glad you know that um nobody really noticed i guess you could [laughter-say] 
sw2433A-ms98-a-0041 195.826500 198.049750 because i got up and started jumping on it again
sw2433A-ms98-a-0042 198.049750 199.249000 [silence]
sw2433A-ms98-a-0043 199.249000 205.541250 yeah really so i enjoy aerobics and i do it because i like it i mean i like the music and
sw2433A-ms98-a-0044 205.541250 207.080750 that kind of stuff
sw2433A-ms98-a-0045 207.080750 212.714875 [silence]
sw2433A-ms98-a-0046 212.714875 214.000500 oh
sw2433A-ms98-a-0047 214.000500 217.422625 that makes my foot how'd you do that in aerobics
sw2433A-ms98-a-0048 217.422625 221.539000 [silence]
sw2433A-ms98-a-0049 221.539000 223.221500 oh goodness
sw2433A-ms98-a-0050 223.221500 224.268000 uh-huh
sw2433A-ms98-a-0051 224.268000 228.149125 [silence]
sw2433A-ms98-a-0052 228.149125 230.998625 what'd they do for that did they have to cast it an[d]-
sw2433A-ms98-a-0053 230.998625 233.416500 [silence]
sw2433A-ms98-a-0054 233.416500 236.758500 oh so the aerobics the impact would not be good
sw2433A-ms98-a-0055 236.758500 242.190875 [silence]
sw2433A-ms98-a-0056 242.190875 243.372125 oh goodness
sw2433A-ms98-a-0057 243.372125 244.414875 [silence]
sw2433A-ms98-a-0058 244.414875 245.407000 uh-huh
sw2433A-ms98-a-0059 245.407000 247.569500 [silence]
sw2433A-ms98-a-0060 247.569500 255.783625 oh that makes sense so i mean are you in terms of other things like like like not running but playing te[nnis]- little bit of tennis or can you not do stuff like that at all
sw2433A-ms98-a-0061 255.783625 261.776125 [silence]
sw2433A-ms98-a-0062 261.776125 263.404500 yeah it's been [vocalized-noise]
sw2433A-ms98-a-0063 263.404500 264.905500 [silence]
sw2433A-ms98-a-0064 264.905500 271.071375 that's probably the safer way because i notice in aerobics um lot of the women that that don't look like they shouldn't be doing certain things
sw2433A-ms98-a-0065 271.071375 273.990000 i'm always afraid they're going to fall over and have a coro[nary]- coronary
sw2433A-ms98-a-0066 273.990000 277.411375 and there was my ego when i went ahead and i went oh i can do that and
sw2433A-ms98-a-0067 277.411375 287.798375 half the time though i don't um jump half as much as i mean i'm like i'm real tall and you know i'm i'm not heavy but when you go easy a hundred seventy at my height um i'm five eleven
sw2433A-ms98-a-0068 287.798375 293.331125 you know you just take it easy um but when i see some wo[men]- i mean so[me]- and i just don't think it's healthy all that pounding all the time
sw2433A-ms98-a-0069 293.331125 294.902375 [silence]
sw2433A-ms98-a-0070 294.902375 297.653750 so yeah that's the other reason and
sw2433A-ms98-a-0071 297.653750 302.716375 i don't know this was just i guess something freak that happened to me because i wasn't fa[miliar]- familiar with the um
sw2433A-ms98-a-0072 302.716375 315.939875 oh it was completely i mean it literally the two dissimilar floor lev[el]- floor coverings were not level and at first after it happened i thought maybe that's a handicap access and then i said no [laughter] that's just the way it's constructed
sw2433A-ms98-a-0073 315.939875 322.286625 and my husband being a TI engineer i said i said a few things to him when i got home i said who has engineered that
sw2433A-ms98-a-0074 322.286625 324.023375 [laughter]
sw2433A-ms98-a-0075 324.023375 327.851250 but i uh sounds like you like one thing that i like like swimming you like that a lot
sw2433A-ms98-a-0076 327.851250 329.030000 [silence]
sw2433A-ms98-a-0077 329.030000 333.764625 do you like that what'd that voice say do you like to exercise because_1 you want to or because_1 you have to
sw2433A-ms98-a-0078 333.764625 337.670000 [silence]
sw2433A-ms98-a-0079 337.670000 339.861250 that's how i am yeah
sw2433A-ms98-a-0080 339.861250 342.885875 if i don't do it i just feel like i don't have as much energy
sw2433A-ms98-a-0081 342.885875 349.306625 [silence]
sw2433A-ms98-a-0082 349.306625 352.962000 right it curbs the appetite and helps with the calories and all that stuff
sw2433A-ms98-a-0083 352.962000 355.492625 [laughter] yeah but
sw2433A-ms98-a-0084 355.492625 359.131250 that gravity factor i know [laughter]
sw2433A-ms98-a-0085 359.131250 371.481375 like that orthopedist said to me he said don't worry Diane he says he said uh you're at thirty something but you're on the upper side he said that uh don't worry he says even if you weren't doing anything your body would start that would start to happen to you
sw2433A-ms98-a-0086 371.481375 377.599000 yeah because_1 i was saying to him i said i'm not that heavy i'm not heavy you know maybe ten to fifteen pounds like any other human being
sw2433A-ms98-a-0087 377.599000 383.247250 i said uh why do i feel like i need to start pushing myself more and he goes human nature [laughter]
sw2433A-ms98-a-0088 383.247250 384.570500 [silence]
sw2433A-ms98-a-0089 384.570500 390.622750 and then you know you see these little girls in these little bitty things and they're all like twenty one years of [laughter-age]
sw2433A-ms98-a-0090 390.622750 393.980875 but luckily at Texans there's a little more diver[se]- diverse clientele
sw2433A-ms98-a-0091 393.980875 395.065625 [silence]
sw2433A-ms98-a-0092 395.065625 397.587125 except for the guys that lift the weights they do intimidate
sw2433A-ms98-a-0093 397.587125 400.678125 there's
sw2433A-ms98-a-0094 400.678125 407.103375 yeah there some things i'd like to try but you know sometime when i ask i just feel like boy am i stupid or what
sw2433A-ms98-a-0095 407.103375 415.923625 [silence]
sw2433A-ms98-a-0096 415.923625 416.963500 uh-huh
sw2433A-ms98-a-0097 416.963500 418.631500 [silence]
sw2433A-ms98-a-0098 418.631500 429.791875 i don't think i've ever i think i've that there was some girl there i've been there like maybe a dozen times but i actually like that site better than the other one just because of the type people that go to
sw2433A-ms98-a-0099 429.791875 436.176500 it's terrible it's i don't know if the Dallas location it just seems that um sometimes i feel like i'm in a singles bar
sw2433A-ms98-a-0100 436.176500 440.325125 [silence]
sw2433A-ms98-a-0101 440.325125 448.721625 no i haven't either and i just uh it's not that far of a drive and i'm glad they did that um you're not missing anything at the Dallas renovated site it's not
sw2433A-ms98-a-0102 448.721625 452.046625 at all anything worth talking about
sw2433A-ms98-a-0103 452.046625 454.210125 [silence]
sw2433A-ms98-a-0104 454.210125 456.668250 yeah but if you don't live near there that's not worth
sw2433A-ms98-a-0105 456.668250 457.221625 we
sw2433A-ms98-a-0106 457.221625 460.753250 [silence]
sw2433A-ms98-a-0107 460.753250 470.274875 yeah that's that's actually where this happened to me out in i say Plano but it's all the same to me Richardson over on Campbell and Park Hill there's a uh new recreation center
sw2433A-ms98-a-0108 470.274875 481.766000 and uh as we were doing it too everybody noticed that there were all these big guys of assorted [laughter-nationalities] [laughter] to play basketball waiting ar[ound]- for us and as we walked out i was limping and i'm like oh great i have purple tights on you know
sw2433A-ms98-a-0109 481.766000 489.861125 and they're going yes but in general i like to exer[cise]- i i like dance a lot so i mean i aerobics is something i'd hate to give up but
sw2433A-ms98-a-0110 489.861125 496.373500 he he kind of said something to me about probably not as bad as your foot but he just said to me maybe you ought to try bicycling or
sw2433A-ms98-a-0111 496.373500 499.987000 [silence]
sw2433A-ms98-a-0112 499.987000 507.310125 [vocalized-noise] he told me eight to twelve weeks not anything you know i said but you're only going to put the cast on for a couple of weeks he said yeah but
sw2433A-ms98-a-0113 507.310125 518.769375 that's just [vocalized-noise] they tried to put me in some kind of um immobilized walker because he doesn't like to put casts on when it's warm but i just the more they tried to get my foot in the more i screamed i couldn't you know
sw2433A-ms98-a-0114 518.769375 523.102250 adjust that well you you know more about this stuff than i do obviously then
sw2433A-ms98-a-0115 523.102250 526.299250 no well you're walking okay now obviously and you can
sw2433A-ms98-a-0116 526.299250 530.474375 [silence]
sw2433A-ms98-a-0117 530.474375 533.236625 [laughter] so you're still able to walk yeah
sw2433A-ms98-a-0118 533.236625 536.476750 well is there anything else about exercise we can talk about
sw2433A-ms98-a-0119 536.476750 538.320125 [silence]
sw2433A-ms98-a-0120 538.320125 542.586750 yeah me too me too i need to go actually get something to eat here [laughter]
sw2433A-ms98-a-0121 542.586750 543.631500 [silence]
