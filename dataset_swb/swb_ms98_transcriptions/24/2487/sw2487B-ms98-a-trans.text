sw2487B-ms98-a-0044 165.452000 168.682875 and i would look at
sw2487B-ms98-a-0045 168.682875 171.748250 what i could afford uh
sw2487B-ms98-a-0046 171.748250 180.775625 i definitely would chose a car on on what appeals to me as far as looks but it'd have to be dependable uh
sw2487B-ms98-a-0047 180.775625 188.710000 it'd h[ave]- 
sw2487B-ms98-a-0048 188.710000 190.220375 it it'd have to be
sw2487B-ms98-a-0049 190.220375 193.277875 [silence]
sw2487B-ms98-a-0050 193.277875 203.175500 exactly and there there's such a range of prices prices in the car market that if you don't start by narrowing it down by that factor i mean
sw2487B-ms98-a-0051 203.175500 212.415750 that really gets you into just one little slot and then there are many many options to go to go to from there uh
sw2487B-ms98-a-0052 212.415750 219.233375 i'd one thing that always interests me is whether or not to buy an American car or a foreign car
sw2487B-ms98-a-0053 219.233375 227.925375 um-hum

sw2487B-ms98-a-0063 258.738875 268.155875 oh we[ll]- absolutely and uh it's it's a nineteen eighty four car and it has eighteen thousand miles on it actual miles
sw2487B-ms98-a-0064 268.155875 272.061375 so it's kind of thing like i'm going to drive this car until it dies
sw2487B-ms98-a-0065 272.061375 282.229750 [laughter] you know [laughter-i] [laughter-mean] it's just too good to and then maybe when i go out and look in in the car market i'll be able to get what i really want and

sw2487B-ms98-a-0077 336.110875 341.675125 exactly and once you once they sense that you really like something
sw2487B-ms98-a-0078 341.675125 343.789000 then you're really in trouble
