sw2487A-ms98-a-0031 119.899125 120.975250 [silence]
sw2487A-ms98-a-0032 120.975250 124.098500 not the new cars but uh ones that are more affordable
sw2487A-ms98-a-0033 124.098500 136.383250 they tend to be very reliable and uh people that uh own them uh typically have them serviced on a regular maintenance schedule i think they're kept in uh better condition than uh most other cars
sw2487A-ms98-a-0034 136.383250 148.392875 [silence]
sw2487A-ms98-a-0035 148.392875 151.834250 uh-huh yeah they don't change style very often i like that

sw2487A-ms98-a-0042 182.808625 189.647875 i find that price is always the governing govern[ing]- governing factor uh regardless of what else you're looking at so
sw2487A-ms98-a-0043 189.647875 194.069250 it's difficult to buy something that's out of your price range something that you can't afford
sw2487A-ms98-a-0044 194.069250 219.197000 [silence]
sw2487A-ms98-a-0045 219.197000 229.737375 uh-huh well i ye[ah]- i drive a Pontiac right now and i've had very good luck with it uh no problems i'm just changing my preference for what type of car i'd like to drive in the future

sw2487A-ms98-a-0057 287.858000 296.646625 [silence]
sw2487A-ms98-a-0058 296.646625 300.374000 right but don't you feel intimidated by talking to a car salesman
sw2487A-ms98-a-0059 300.374000 312.858000 [silence]
sw2487A-ms98-a-0060 312.858000 316.869625 okay well that's great if they can make you feel at ease that's pretty good
sw2487A-ms98-a-0061 316.869625 326.357500 [silence]

sw2487A-ms98-a-0065 337.510250 343.279875 [silence]
sw2487A-ms98-a-0066 343.279875 352.787875 yeah if they sense that you're really interested and that's the car for you they're whe[n]- [laughter] they're negotiating position is that they're going to get as much money out of you as they can 
sw2487A-ms98-a-0067 352.787875 355.284500 with as many options piled on
sw2487A-ms98-a-0068 355.284500 384.635750 [silence]
sw2487A-ms98-a-0069 384.635750 385.869875 sure
sw2487A-ms98-a-0070 385.869875 393.823500 well you tend to do a lot better on selling a used car as an individual placing an ad in the paper as opposed to trading it in at a dealership
sw2487A-ms98-a-0071 393.823500 403.279625 [silence]
sw2487A-ms98-a-0072 403.279625 406.997875 sure well i've found that any car that runs is basically in demand
sw2487A-ms98-a-0073 406.997875 414.468875 and uh you can go pretty much by the blue book value or by uh comparison uh listings
sw2487A-ms98-a-0074 414.468875 421.195125 [silence]
sw2487A-ms98-a-0075 421.195125 422.484250 yeah um-hum

sw2487A-ms98-a-0078 433.269125 434.972625 [silence]
sw2487A-ms98-a-0079 434.972625 441.813500 well i'm not sure i'm i'm just uh kind of thinking about it and haven't really made any uh decisions or commitments on it
sw2487A-ms98-a-0080 441.813500 443.556875 [silence]
sw2487A-ms98-a-0081 443.556875 453.551375 well i drive a black car right now and i've always liked black but uh i maybe uh interested in other colors uh i'm not really interested in yellow or white
sw2487A-ms98-a-0082 453.551375 456.570500 but i've always had a preference for red
sw2487A-ms98-a-0083 456.570500 458.512000 and black
sw2487A-ms98-a-0084 458.512000 466.324375 and uh well it's just something i'd have to think about depended on it depends on which uh what cars are available
sw2487A-ms98-a-0085 466.324375 468.444125 [silence]
sw2487A-ms98-a-0086 468.444125 475.034250 oh no i would uh go to the want ads in the paper and uh find one that would meet my uh needs
sw2487A-ms98-a-0087 475.034250 476.837250 [silence]
sw2487A-ms98-a-0088 476.837250 477.842625 [laughter]

sw2487A-ms98-a-0090 481.508500 488.540000 well may[be]- maybe sometime soon i don't know probably not this year i think i need to concentrate more on getting a paint job for the car that i have right now
sw2487A-ms98-a-0091 488.540000 491.483000 and just keeping it in uh good operating condition
sw2487A-ms98-a-0092 491.483000 500.760000 [silence]
sw2487A-ms98-a-0093 500.760000 509.013875 yeah well that's the point it isn't costing me any money right now it's running uh very well and i haven't had car payments for seven years i enjoy that immensely
sw2487A-ms98-a-0094 509.013875 511.119250 [silence]
sw2487A-ms98-a-0095 511.119250 513.607000 i'm driving a nineteen eighty Trans AM
sw2487A-ms98-a-0096 513.607000 516.296750 the only trouble i have with it is with insurance companies
sw2487A-ms98-a-0097 516.296750 517.467875 [silence]
sw2487A-ms98-a-0098 517.467875 519.159750 they don't want to insure it
sw2487A-ms98-a-0099 519.159750 521.160375 [silence]
sw2487A-ms98-a-0100 521.160375 523.753000 just because it's a sporty model
sw2487A-ms98-a-0101 523.753000 532.412875 has nothing to do with driving record i have no accidents or tickets and uh [laughter] they're very reluctant uh yet even to insure that car
sw2487A-ms98-a-0102 532.412875 540.153500 [silence]
sw2487A-ms98-a-0103 540.153500 550.031750 yeah well my insurance agent told me that uh when when i uh bought a new car or whe[n]- when i more specifically when i bought my Honda [laughter] to give him a call
sw2487A-ms98-a-0104 550.031750 553.563500 because then he wou[ld]- he would make me a good deal on an insurance policy
sw2487A-ms98-a-0105 553.563500 554.731000 [silence]
sw2487A-ms98-a-0106 554.731000 557.436125 but i haven't really no intention of buying a Honda
sw2487A-ms98-a-0107 557.436125 560.002125 [silence]
sw2487A-ms98-a-0108 560.002125 563.958500 it uh well it's it's more like an economy car
sw2487A-ms98-a-0109 563.958500 570.025375 and uh i'd be looking more of uh more for a luxury sedan something with a little more status
sw2487A-ms98-a-0110 570.025375 575.263500 [silence]
sw2487A-ms98-a-0111 575.263500 587.635250 i really don't consider it to be a status symbol uh it's just uh i'm interested i know people who have cars of that nature and uh they tend to hold their quality 
sw2487A-ms98-a-0112 587.635250 589.702625 and hold their value
sw2487A-ms98-a-0113 589.702625 594.242000 uh and they're just very attractive automobiles as far as i'm concerned
sw2487A-ms98-a-0114 594.242000 599.904875 [silence]
