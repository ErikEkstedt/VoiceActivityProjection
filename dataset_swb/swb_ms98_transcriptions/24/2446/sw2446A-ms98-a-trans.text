sw2446A-ms98-a-0044 385.940750 388.018625 yeah i was in Peru
sw2446A-ms98-a-0045 388.018625 390.486000 but um
sw2446A-ms98-a-0046 390.486000 404.415625 i there weren't as i recall or at least i wasn't aware of that many Americans there except for a very heavy concentration of Peace Corps volunteers this was when the Peace Corps first are started and it was one of the big targets
sw2446A-ms98-a-0047 404.415625 410.607250 and um i don't i don't think at that time at least Peace Corps was
sw2446A-ms98-a-0048 410.607250 412.462750 uh
sw2446A-ms98-a-0049 412.462750 427.256000 an obnoxious group in the sense that that we were very controlled regarding number of days off and and you couldn't just take up [vocalized-noise] take off and leave your group and go explore and and things like that
sw2446A-ms98-a-0050 427.256000 436.994250 but and i was working actually in the savings and loan program so that was quite specialized although i was living in the slums i was really working with the middle class
sw2446A-ms98-a-0051 436.994250 438.969250 [silence]
sw2446A-ms98-a-0052 438.969250 441.508500 i was up in Arequipa

sw2446A-ms98-a-0057 447.467375 451.078000 [silence]
sw2446A-ms98-a-0058 451.078000 460.736625 i don't have any idea um probably not i mean there were thir[teen]- i was uh Per[u]- Peru thirteen which meant there were twelve groups before mine
sw2446A-ms98-a-0059 460.736625 474.911375 that had gone in and and some of them were quite big in the sense they were community development and they were building schools and doing coops and things like that health um inoculation and and things
sw2446A-ms98-a-0060 474.911375 487.626875 [silence]
sw2446A-ms98-a-0061 487.626875 496.940625 no no i believe they did because um some of some of the the Peace Corps uh that i knew of did marry Peruvians
sw2446A-ms98-a-0062 496.940625 507.131125 and have been back and every now and then some news filters in that they went to see some of the old things and of course the savings and loan program um
sw2446A-ms98-a-0063 507.131125 521.788125 that was that you know that that just continued to grow in fact after my group i mean we were just a very small specialized group too to get that going and spread and then of course Peace Corps bowed out of that because that's uh uh
sw2446A-ms98-a-0064 521.788125 526.903125 something that nationalized very quickly and the same with the coops
sw2446A-ms98-a-0065 526.903125 531.650750 [silence]
sw2446A-ms98-a-0066 531.650750 533.126875 right

sw2446A-ms98-a-0069 547.667250 555.824750 yeah i've you know some of the programs i would have concern about like um the language teaching you know i mean
sw2446A-ms98-a-0070 555.824750 567.679500 why should we push English and a lot of people were down there teaching English and when they talked about Hungary or someplace one of the eastern law countries requesting Peace Corps to teach
sw2446A-ms98-a-0071 567.679500 581.393250 language you know to me that's a little bit marginal i did teach economics at the university one night a week and the textbook was in English but basically i taught it in Spanish because i mean
sw2446A-ms98-a-0072 581.393250 586.800375 i really didn't see the point in their knowing stuff rotely and writing it on a test
sw2446A-ms98-a-0073 586.800375 599.837875 [silence]
