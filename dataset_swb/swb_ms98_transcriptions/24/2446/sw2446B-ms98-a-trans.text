sw2446B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.050250 [noise]
sw2446B-ms98-a-0002 1.050250 3.637000 good morning
sw2446B-ms98-a-0003 3.637000 17.205000 uh okay go ahead [laughter] yeah i understand the topic this morning is uh our policy in Latin America and you know what we've been doing down there so uh
sw2446B-ms98-a-0004 17.205000 27.089750 as you indicated you don't have too much input into the area it it just so happens that uh our daughter-in-law is Panamanian
sw2446B-ms98-a-0005 27.089750 32.608750 and uh we have been in Panama and i have worked in El Salvador and
sw2446B-ms98-a-0006 32.608750 41.119250 we visit Mexico occasionally so [laughter] yeah we we do have a little information on it here but uh
sw2446B-ms98-a-0007 41.119250 47.247750 [silence]
sw2446B-ms98-a-0008 47.247750 48.794250 oh uh-huh
sw2446B-ms98-a-0009 48.794250 52.296750 [silence]
sw2446B-ms98-a-0010 52.296750 53.889875 yeah
sw2446B-ms98-a-0011 53.889875 59.252875 it does seem to have quieted down there just a little bit that's that's for sure
sw2446B-ms98-a-0012 59.252875 71.057625 no i the US policy uh towards Central America as far as uh well i kind of go back to to the El Salvador thing because Texas Instruments had a
sw2446B-ms98-a-0013 71.057625 82.843500 a plant down there for a while and i worked in there for a little while and at that particular time let's let's see that was seventy three seventy four kind of before the the uh the
sw2446B-ms98-a-0014 82.843500 97.703500 the uh the Civil War really picked up down there and US policy at that particular time there was of course military assistance to uh to the government itself you know anything that's
sw2446B-ms98-a-0015 97.703500 110.633625 that's {anticommunist} you know we kind of had a tendency to be pro [laughter] it don't matter what their excesses were and i believe at the time that i was down there that uh the
sw2446B-ms98-a-0016 110.633625 123.435875 government uh the Salvadorian government [vocalized-noise] you know really gotten out of hand yet the uh right wing death squad type situation i believe that that was beginning to form but i don't
sw2446B-ms98-a-0017 123.435875 136.594125 i i wasn't really aware of it's being you know terribly uh you know rapid at the time that that i was down there i think that really kind of developed a little bit later on
sw2446B-ms98-a-0018 136.594125 143.146375 but uh our policies seem to be pretty much one of uh you know trying to setup businesses
sw2446B-ms98-a-0019 143.146375 155.433250 down there and use the one resource anyway that Salvador had [noise] plenty of and that was people we didn't seem to be going in and taking anything out of the country other than just it's it's labor
sw2446B-ms98-a-0020 155.433250 166.095000 because everything that TI did anyway we we shipped in and it was worked on down there assembled and then sent back here so i didn't feel that we really ex[ploiting]- exploiting them any
sw2446B-ms98-a-0021 166.095000 174.210625 [silence]
sw2446B-ms98-a-0022 174.210625 183.951375 no uh in the particular incidence that i was aware of now TI wasn't the only ones in there Playtex was in there was uh several other companies and uh
sw2446B-ms98-a-0023 183.951375 197.337750 of course we kind of concentrate [vocalized-noise] there wasn't much to take out of the country [vocalized-noise] felt like we're going in and taken all their um their gold or oil or bananas or coffee or anything like that because uh it just
sw2446B-ms98-a-0024 197.337750 203.248750 the only thing that they had a great abundance of was uh you know human beings [laughter]
sw2446B-ms98-a-0025 203.248750 218.516250 [silence]
sw2446B-ms98-a-0026 218.516250 219.846750 [vocalized-noise]
sw2446B-ms98-a-0027 219.846750 223.623875 yeah i understand what you say there was a uh [noise]
sw2446B-ms98-a-0028 223.623875 236.350750 the time that i was down there i stayed quite a a bit at the uh uh one of the big hotels San Salvador and at the time i thought there ought to be a law against American tourists
sw2446B-ms98-a-0029 236.350750 241.614250 because they for the most part tend to be the most obnoxious
sw2446B-ms98-a-0030 241.614250 251.374625 as a as a group and i saw this in Panama also uh oh you know it's it's the uh the almost stereotype
sw2446B-ms98-a-0031 251.374625 262.511125 you know flowery shirt shorts camera hanging around their neck you know demanding this that and the other thing you know we're we're here and we want this and we want that and that sort of thing that's
sw2446B-ms98-a-0032 262.511125 266.863125 that's the stereotype that's very strong down there you know that uh
sw2446B-ms98-a-0033 266.863125 270.028625 the you know that sort of [vocalized-noise]
sw2446B-ms98-a-0034 270.028625 275.269000 i i i believe those of us who were working down there got a little bit more appreciation for
sw2446B-ms98-a-0035 275.269000 277.465000 you know the local
sw2446B-ms98-a-0036 277.465000 282.394250 uh culture [vocalized-noise] i really don't believe that we were
sw2446B-ms98-a-0037 282.394250 288.922375 quite that bad but yet they were having to deal directly with uh you know with the uh the local people
sw2446B-ms98-a-0038 288.922375 290.260750 and uh
sw2446B-ms98-a-0039 290.260750 298.280000 but boy there is a there is a bad uh uh you know the old brash ugly American type
sw2446B-ms98-a-0040 298.280000 308.569875 situation and i saw incidences in the hotel where i just wanted to go over and crawl in the corner and say oh my God those are those are not Americans [laughter] they can't be but they are
sw2446B-ms98-a-0041 308.569875 319.750625 and uh of course now i i do have to i remember one case where we had some Canadians in there who were every bit as bad but i mean it i think it's just kind of the North American
sw2446B-ms98-a-0042 319.750625 325.482875 situation uh in in Panama they've been used to Americans down there for so darn long
sw2446B-ms98-a-0043 325.482875 339.618500 but i didn't see quite as much of that sort of thing as Panamanians are just about as as uh as jaded as Americans as far as uh creature comforts you know they're uh they're they're every bit uh
sw2446B-ms98-a-0044 339.618500 351.337500 i i know when my my son was in the Air Force and he was stationed in Panama and he married a Panamanian girl and when she came up here uh you know she's
sw2446B-ms98-a-0045 351.337500 360.552000 y[ou]- kn[ow]- except for the language situation some of the cultures she's just about an American you know is as far as TV and
sw2446B-ms98-a-0046 360.552000 375.519375 and you know the the moneymaking part of it and all that matter of fact if anything she's worse [laughter] but uh uh [vocalized-noise] it just there's little enclaves down there where you know Americans have a lot of influence
sw2446B-ms98-a-0047 375.519375 378.065875 and the local population kind of
sw2446B-ms98-a-0048 378.065875 379.309875 [silence]
sw2446B-ms98-a-0049 379.309875 383.688500 um you know sort of accepts that but i've also seen the other side of it too
sw2446B-ms98-a-0050 383.688500 384.758250 [silence]
sw2446B-ms98-a-0051 384.758250 386.499500 well you were in Peru
sw2446B-ms98-a-0052 386.499500 399.947750 [silence]
