sw4926A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 6.161000 [noise] i kind of think the probably the biggest political topic that i can think of at this point
sw4926A-ms98-a-0002 6.161000 18.823500 is probably the Ross Perot uh candidacy uh i think that that has some interesting uh effects to it at this point with the uh
sw4926A-ms98-a-0003 18.823500 20.863000 level of um
sw4926A-ms98-a-0004 20.863000 30.161750 uh ou[trage]- outrage that the public seems to have the voting public seems to have with the existing candidates out there and i think that uh
sw4926A-ms98-a-0005 30.161750 34.553375 that is certainly something that we haven't seen to this level before
sw4926A-ms98-a-0006 34.553375 56.401375 [silence]
sw4926A-ms98-a-0007 56.401375 59.203000 [noise] what's your view on
sw4926A-ms98-a-0008 59.203000 61.813875 big political issues
sw4926A-ms98-a-0009 61.813875 83.381250 [silence]
sw4926A-ms98-a-0010 83.381250 84.742250 um-hum
sw4926A-ms98-a-0011 84.742250 105.406875 [silence]
sw4926A-ms98-a-0012 105.406875 106.723625 yeah
sw4926A-ms98-a-0013 106.723625 128.340125 [silence]
sw4926A-ms98-a-0014 128.340125 129.603750 [laughter]

sw4926A-ms98-a-0018 165.621500 179.188625 [noise] it['s]- it's going to be interesting to see if he uh actually you know we hear the complaints about uh voter apathy and and the whole the whole shebang about throw the bums out
sw4926A-ms98-a-0019 179.188625 188.234000 it and i[t]- it usually you know it's a big deal until election day comes around and then it you know it fizzles out and we end up with the same people
sw4926A-ms98-a-0020 188.234000 196.794500 and uh you have to wonder whether is this going to be something that uh is really going to result in
sw4926A-ms98-a-0021 196.794500 207.591125 um a mass turnout of the current people that we have in there or whether this is just going to be another of the same old well throw the bums out but not my bum you know [laughter]
sw4926A-ms98-a-0022 207.591125 222.630125 [silence]
sw4926A-ms98-a-0023 222.630125 231.233375 well the m[edia]- media keeps saying that he's supposed to drain it away from the Democrats but i know that there's a lot of Democrats that don't like Bill Clinton
sw4926A-ms98-a-0024 231.233375 236.414500 i'm one of them [laughter-i'm] [laughter-not] happy with Bill Clinton at all uh but
sw4926A-ms98-a-0025 236.414500 248.050375 i you know i'm c[oncerned]- more concerned about Democrats saying they're unhappy with Bill Clinton and then they go and vote for Ross Perot and then we basically split any protest vote
sw4926A-ms98-a-0026 248.050375 261.933875 ag[ainst]- against Bush more or less in half you know i mean you're dividing it too far and then he squeaks by for four more years and you know for me that's not a going to be a wonderful uh feeling
sw4926A-ms98-a-0027 261.933875 263.974625 but uh
sw4926A-ms98-a-0028 263.974625 274.161625 i think it'll be interesting to see um whether it turns out he gets more than twenty percent of the vote if that um i
sw4926A-ms98-a-0029 274.161625 294.261875 [silence]
sw4926A-ms98-a-0030 294.261875 299.714000 yeah but i you know it'll be interesting i i don't i agree that i don't think that
