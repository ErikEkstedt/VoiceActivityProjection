sw4926B-ms98-a-0006 39.194500 51.686875 as a[s]- as popular as he seems to be and i mean it seems to be um doesn't really matter who who it is it's just that fact that he's not in either party
sw4926B-ms98-a-0007 51.686875 55.683625 that uh seems to be why he's so popular i guess
sw4926B-ms98-a-0008 55.683625 61.090750 [silence]

sw4926B-ms98-a-0013 70.396250 83.790750 i would just say that you know it's it's interesting that it doesn't really seem to matter what um what his views are you know i mean he seems to have some views which are pretty conservative and which are pretty liberal
sw4926B-ms98-a-0014 83.790750 85.095125 um
sw4926B-ms98-a-0015 85.095125 93.383500 but i[t]- it seems like people are more interested in just the fact that he's an alternative you know than to um
sw4926B-ms98-a-0016 93.383500 106.000000 to what what you know i[t]- i- i guess he hasn't really outlined a platform yet you know and people keep asking him you know what what do you feel uh is the b[est]- a plan to deal with the budget or blah blah blah
sw4926B-ms98-a-0017 106.000000 117.920125 and um he really doesn't have any answers i guess but that doesn't stop his popularity from swelling you know people are just sick and tired of um everyone else i guess 
sw4926B-ms98-a-0018 117.920125 123.397125 it seems to be i don't know it's kind of like um people always

sw4926B-ms98-a-0021 140.290000 145.917250 they're always they're always trying to find third third alternatives like um

sw4926B-ms98-a-0023 151.567750 160.150750 but you know all they have to do is vote him out of office you know it's almost like they want to be forced to vote the way that they
