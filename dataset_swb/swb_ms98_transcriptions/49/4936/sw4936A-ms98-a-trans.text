sw4936A-ms98-a-0008 44.203000 50.360375 i guess tha[t]- we've been fairly successful with those that's uh that's a kind of low risk sort of project isn't it i guess
sw4936A-ms98-a-0009 50.360375 62.637750 um i have a a um really nice desk a nicer desk than i could afford [laughter-which] i got because my sister who worked in a hospital uh liberated it after a fire and uh
sw4936A-ms98-a-0010 62.637750 69.062250 we stripped it all the way down and refinished it it turned out to be really nice uh pretty nice desk maple top i think or

sw4936A-ms98-a-0018 81.633125 86.099875 yeah [noise] i've i do do things uh that
sw4936A-ms98-a-0019 86.099875 89.953000 might be too crude to be called woodworking i've built my own deck and
sw4936A-ms98-a-0020 89.953000 92.430750 um [noise] things like that [vocalized-noise]
sw4936A-ms98-a-0021 92.430750 95.195250 [silence]
sw4936A-ms98-a-0022 95.195250 96.784625 and i [noise]
sw4936A-ms98-a-0023 96.784625 101.266250 i definitely have begun to accumulate tools too my i uh
sw4936A-ms98-a-0024 101.266250 114.942000 i picked up a bunch of Craftsman tools from the forties that my wife's father owned when he was alive and so i do have a band saw and a router and um things like that out in the garage but i can't say i use them_1 very often
sw4936A-ms98-a-0025 114.942000 118.711125 [noise]
sw4936A-ms98-a-0026 118.711125 129.421875 they're handy uh they they come in handy at the most unusual times putting doors in is the time when i'm uh i bought myself a um
sw4936A-ms98-a-0027 129.421875 134.461375 template for making mortices and doors and that's a whole lot easier than doing it with a chisel
sw4936A-ms98-a-0028 134.461375 141.578750 [laughter] but i've also i've also used them for building drawers where you uh for rabbeting and uh
sw4936A-ms98-a-0029 141.578750 147.726750 because uh rabbeting on my table on my uh radial arm saw is a little bit uncertain [laughter]
sw4936A-ms98-a-0030 147.726750 157.501500 so i got one for Christmas a few years ago and used it quite a bit for the first eight months i had it and now i- i use it twice a year maybe

sw4936A-ms98-a-0037 173.313250 175.614625 [noise] the ones that what

sw4936A-ms98-a-0039 177.092625 185.519500 uh i have never even s[een]- i've never even looked at one closely and the the little use that i've gotten from my router i would say
sw4936A-ms98-a-0040 185.519500 187.983000 uh i would spend my money on the bits [laughter]
sw4936A-ms98-a-0041 187.983000 195.689375 um i have a i'd guess you'd call a medium quality Craftsman router and the um
sw4936A-ms98-a-0042 195.689375 196.897250 [noise]
sw4936A-ms98-a-0043 196.897250 202.993625 it's strong enough for any job where you don't try to take more than say three eighths of an inch at a time
sw4936A-ms98-a-0044 202.993625 212.890625 but the problem is that the uh as with any any time you buy um a a tool with a[s]- a[s]- as a as a package the bits that they give you are low end
sw4936A-ms98-a-0045 212.890625 225.054250 [noise] so [vocalized-noise] the price of a good set of uh carbide steel uh bits is probably um i mean a a good set of bits is probably gonna run you a hundred dollars and uh um
sw4936A-ms98-a-0046 225.054250 233.334875 if you're gonna use it for a lifetime i suppose it's worth it because_1 [vocalized-noise] um imagine if i go and sharpen them_1 myself uh it won't last
sw4936A-ms98-a-0047 233.334875 236.174375 [noise] and i've never had the bits sharpened
sw4936A-ms98-a-0048 236.174375 239.370750 so that's a thing to consider is to
sw4936A-ms98-a-0049 239.370750 249.104250 yeah and they they dull after a while especially i did some cabinets in um ash and oak and uh that that wears a bit down
sw4936A-ms98-a-0050 249.104250 258.017625 we remodeled and saved a bunch of really nice ash cabinets uh which had been in the original remodeling of our kitchen
sw4936A-ms98-a-0051 258.017625 266.398250 [noise] and i saved them and built an oven cabinet out of one and another cabinet out of another by using the faces and so forth [noise] and
sw4936A-ms98-a-0052 266.398250 272.088750 uh routing hardwood will um take the edge off a cheap bit pretty fast so
sw4936A-ms98-a-0053 272.088750 276.372500 [silence]
sw4936A-ms98-a-0054 276.372500 278.111875 right that's uh
sw4936A-ms98-a-0055 278.111875 281.651250 and then you take the blade to the to get sharpened right [laughter]
sw4936A-ms98-a-0056 281.651250 283.008250 [noise]

sw4936A-ms98-a-0060 287.274875 288.922125 yeah
sw4936A-ms98-a-0061 288.922125 293.964875 [noise] well i've used mine on treated wood and now all my blades need sharpening
sw4936A-ms98-a-0062 293.964875 297.207375 because uh the treated wood will also chew them_1 up
