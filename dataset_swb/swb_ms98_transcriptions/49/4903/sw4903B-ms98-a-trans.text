sw4903B-ms98-a-0002 0.487000 24.669875 [silence]
sw4903B-ms98-a-0003 24.669875 26.303625 huh-uh
sw4903B-ms98-a-0004 26.303625 38.455750 [silence]
sw4903B-ms98-a-0005 38.455750 45.334125 well there not i mean there really is no Soviet Union now unfortunately they still do have a lot of uh nuclear weapons
sw4903B-ms98-a-0006 45.334125 53.306875 and uh the one thing that worries me is is question of stability and control
sw4903B-ms98-a-0007 53.306875 61.261375 and uh i think it's too early to say you know whether they're going to develop some stable societies there in one form or another
sw4903B-ms98-a-0008 61.261375 65.239250 or whether this uh [vocalized-noise] old uh Russian tendency to 
sw4903B-ms98-a-0009 65.239250 70.738250 turn their fate over to some insane ruler is going to surface again
sw4903B-ms98-a-0010 70.738250 72.734375 [vocalized-noise]
sw4903B-ms98-a-0011 72.734375 75.262500 [silence]
sw4903B-ms98-a-0012 75.262500 82.999375 no they really didn't uh now you know they never really have had democracy there in any sense so
sw4903B-ms98-a-0013 82.999375 84.270875 um
sw4903B-ms98-a-0014 84.270875 92.497250 it's going to take both democracy and economic progress and uh resolution of their nationalist institutes i guess
sw4903B-ms98-a-0015 92.497250 99.998625 all of that is going to have to happen and if any one of them turn sour they could still be uh dangerous simply because they might not
sw4903B-ms98-a-0016 99.998625 103.994250 you know they just might sort of lose track of what they're doing
sw4903B-ms98-a-0017 103.994250 141.918500 [silence]
sw4903B-ms98-a-0018 141.918500 152.496125 but that's really part of the danger because they still have uh you know i think there still uh missile uh bases or silos in uh
sw4903B-ms98-a-0019 152.496125 156.490375 in uh Kazakhstan probably in Ukraine
sw4903B-ms98-a-0020 156.490375 164.144625 as well as in Russia uh those in Russia may be some of them in areas that uh may have uh
sw4903B-ms98-a-0021 164.144625 171.810875 strong local national sentiments because_1 they aren't all Russians you know they're a lot of enclaves they have other nationalities
sw4903B-ms98-a-0022 171.810875 174.484750 and if even one uh
sw4903B-ms98-a-0023 174.484750 180.233875 missile silo got in the hands of someone who is uh determined to
sw4903B-ms98-a-0024 180.233875 185.499375 cause trouble for some for some reason they might launch a missile on someone
sw4903B-ms98-a-0025 185.499375 199.493125 [silence]
sw4903B-ms98-a-0026 199.493125 204.246875 governments and militaries and it's not always clear which one of them is in charge
sw4903B-ms98-a-0027 204.246875 210.463500 well that's maybe the uh the uh extreme pessimistic view
sw4903B-ms98-a-0028 210.463500 219.744000 um think if uh Yeltsin has a chance and if they can follow his lead in the other republics or whatever they want to call themselves now
sw4903B-ms98-a-0029 219.744000 223.519250 um they'll probably come out of it okay
sw4903B-ms98-a-0030 223.519250 242.468000 [silence]
sw4903B-ms98-a-0031 242.468000 245.984625 what in the former Soviet Union
sw4903B-ms98-a-0032 245.984625 251.781625 um not much i don't think i think that uh
sw4903B-ms98-a-0033 251.781625 258.994000 probably or uh or uh image there is pretty good most places as i understand it
sw4903B-ms98-a-0034 258.994000 277.976500 [silence]
sw4903B-ms98-a-0035 277.976500 284.982750 what might make them angry at us may make the people angry at us or the governments or both or
sw4903B-ms98-a-0036 284.982750 286.713625 [silence]
sw4903B-ms98-a-0037 286.713625 288.256125 well
sw4903B-ms98-a-0038 288.256125 289.477125 [silence]
sw4903B-ms98-a-0039 289.477125 291.490000 i think if they uh
sw4903B-ms98-a-0040 291.490000 299.522000 thought that we were taking advantage of their uh current preoccupations with internal matters or with
