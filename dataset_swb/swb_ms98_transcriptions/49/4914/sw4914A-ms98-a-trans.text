sw4914A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.740000 [noise] why don't you start this time
sw4914A-ms98-a-0002 1.740000 20.264000 [silence]
sw4914A-ms98-a-0003 20.264000 31.932000 yeah i'm in the same position i started on a Commodore in nineteen eighty six um and moved up in eighty eight to an IBM system and i'm running on an IBM clone right now
sw4914A-ms98-a-0004 31.932000 37.437000 under windows which basically is the same thing i [laughter-think] [laughter] 
sw4914A-ms98-a-0005 37.437000 47.509250 and uh i've used it also i do tremendous amounts of word processing i work in radio but i'm required to do a lot of you know journalistic writing and that
sw4914A-ms98-a-0006 47.509250 59.937875 uh so i do almost everything now in Word or in some other you know word processing system and uh use it to gather news and information and put it all together for something that's usable
sw4914A-ms98-a-0007 59.937875 68.540000 so i've had my computer i've i i've found what's happened is that i can't write anymore on paper you [laughter-know]
sw4914A-ms98-a-0008 68.540000 76.032125 because i type so fast now that any it's distracting to try and write by hand because it takes too long
sw4914A-ms98-a-0009 76.032125 83.373750 [silence]
sw4914A-ms98-a-0010 83.373750 85.016125 oh yeah
sw4914A-ms98-a-0011 85.016125 88.515375 [silence]
sw4914A-ms98-a-0012 88.515375 90.130375 [noise]
sw4914A-ms98-a-0013 90.130375 96.995875 [vocalized-noise] and of course you know i also run a bulletin board from here and i'm involved in FidoNet 
sw4914A-ms98-a-0014 96.995875 101.939125 uh i'm the i'm the net coordinator up here for western and central New York
sw4914A-ms98-a-0015 101.939125 107.626500 uh part of Net 260 here it's got we have eighty nodes in this city alone
sw4914A-ms98-a-0016 107.626500 115.614625 so we t[ry]- we try and get everybody together and that way it you know you can exchange mail between them and you don't have to call them
sw4914A-ms98-a-0017 115.614625 117.226000 [laughter]
sw4914A-ms98-a-0018 117.226000 124.005875 and i just got into the w[e]- FidoNet's now has a thing where we can get in with the internet so i found out
sw4914A-ms98-a-0019 124.005875 126.890250 [silence]
sw4914A-ms98-a-0020 126.890250 130.713500 yeah i it's where i found out about this through Comp DCom Telecom
sw4914A-ms98-a-0021 130.713500 137.812750 uh and i submit some messages on there i it's made things s[o]- so much easier it's amazing though that
sw4914A-ms98-a-0022 137.812750 142.500875 [vocalized-noise] in nineteen eighty six we were all doing like three hundred bawd
sw4914A-ms98-a-0023 142.500875 149.950750 and of course you know now that's like ancient history and you think my God it was only like five six years ago [laughter]
sw4914A-ms98-a-0024 149.950750 150.496125 [noise]
sw4914A-ms98-a-0025 150.496125 157.827000 [laughter-and] [laughter-then] here's what we have now i mean what's in five years from now it's just unimaginable what we're going to be able to do with these things
sw4914A-ms98-a-0026 157.827000 162.774000 [silence]
sw4914A-ms98-a-0027 162.774000 163.984000 hm
sw4914A-ms98-a-0028 163.984000 165.483625 [silence]
sw4914A-ms98-a-0029 165.483625 167.974625 well that's good Gore's working on
sw4914A-ms98-a-0030 167.974625 174.799125 [silence]
sw4914A-ms98-a-0031 174.799125 176.078750 yeah
sw4914A-ms98-a-0032 176.078750 179.469000 [silence]
sw4914A-ms98-a-0033 179.469000 189.517125 well i see the phone companies are working on getting into information services so we're going to have a glut of things everyone i think we're going to see another revolution in
sw4914A-ms98-a-0034 189.517125 199.310625 computers but i think the reason why it didn't work the first time is that they assumed that everybody would need a computer to do all these things
sw4914A-ms98-a-0035 199.310625 208.027250 uh when in fact at the time you know back in the early eighties uh and mid eighties you know people didn't the technology wasn't to the point where
sw4914A-ms98-a-0036 208.027250 217.723375 it was something that could be easily learned for everyone but now we have the things like the Mac and Windows and other things where all you got to do is point at something and push a button
sw4914A-ms98-a-0037 217.723375 229.950625 and i think that the technology's catching up to the point where we're going to be able to do things and make it a lot easier t[o]- for people to understand how to do these things
sw4914A-ms98-a-0038 229.950625 236.980500 so i'm hoping that we will see another type of revolution but one that will be a little more friendly to the end user
sw4914A-ms98-a-0039 236.980500 245.996250 [silence]
sw4914A-ms98-a-0040 245.996250 247.563875 um-hum
sw4914A-ms98-a-0041 247.563875 261.485625 [silence]
sw4914A-ms98-a-0042 261.485625 269.169875 well they're working on that i'm a satellite dish owner and we've been fighting like mad to have these suckers re-regulated you know
sw4914A-ms98-a-0043 269.169875 272.991875 [laughter-because] of the uh because they've stomped on us
sw4914A-ms98-a-0044 272.991875 280.861875 and so now what's happening is the phone companies want to get into cable and introduce all these kinds of computer services over fiber optics
sw4914A-ms98-a-0045 280.861875 286.852000 and the cable industry now wants to get into the telephone industry through these personal communication things
sw4914A-ms98-a-0046 286.852000 299.170000 but i think everyone's working now i i mean i'm seeing this we're going to see a lot more in the way of keyboards with electronic program guides and and everything else and ordering systems they have this thing called TV [vocalized-noise]
