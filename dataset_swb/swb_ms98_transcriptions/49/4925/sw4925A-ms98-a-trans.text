sw4925A-ms98-a-0004 11.232875 16.050500 yeah i haven't given much thought to it i'm kind of busy raising my kids
sw4925A-ms98-a-0005 16.050500 20.902875 the only way i can relate to it is i think of my mother taking care of her parents
sw4925A-ms98-a-0006 20.902875 25.083500 and i remember her running over there every morning to make sure they got
sw4925A-ms98-a-0007 25.083500 28.553250 dressed and an[d]- and [noise] fed and cleaned
sw4925A-ms98-a-0008 28.553250 40.916750 and uh i remember her saying to me i hope don't ever let me do that to you put me in a home because it's it's hellish on the person who has to give the care to a person like that
sw4925A-ms98-a-0009 40.916750 42.282000 you know these
sw4925A-ms98-a-0010 42.282000 46.303000 [silence]

sw4925A-ms98-a-0015 57.406625 69.515125 we[ll]- i don't think yeah i don't think the problem is i mean those condos are like elderly people just living in their own apartments i think the trouble begins when they have more physical problems
sw4925A-ms98-a-0016 69.515125 75.719750 i mean it's got to be humiliating to have a stranger a nurse or somebody lift you in and out of a bathtub
sw4925A-ms98-a-0017 75.719750 90.465500 you know because_1 i mean i'm i'm not aged but i'm i'm forty one now and i still feel twenty something and i realize that my body is kind of traitorous and and and changing on me even though i'm not feeling terribly old
sw4925A-ms98-a-0018 90.465500 101.640500 so i can imagine you [vocalized-noise] you know being eighty and somebody has to dress you and you're probably sitting there thinking my God this is so [laughter-degrading] but your body just won't do it

sw4925A-ms98-a-0033 168.039500 181.639500 well i you know [vocalized-noise] my thought is if your mind goes at the same rate your body goes then nobody cares right you know it's like animals when they're stupid what the hell do they know [laughter] i think if one goes before the other is when you run [laughter-into] trouble
sw4925A-ms98-a-0034 181.639500 188.908000 [silence]

sw4925A-ms98-a-0046 231.907750 237.549250 talking about [vocalized-noise] what would you look for if you had to put someone in a home i guess
sw4925A-ms98-a-0047 237.549250 239.012625 uh
sw4925A-ms98-a-0048 239.012625 245.792000 i don't know i guess a place that has the most activities you know keeping your mind alive even if you couldn't do very much
