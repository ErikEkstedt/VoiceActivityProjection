sw4902B-ms98-a-0005 10.114625 12.964750 as far as immigration as a whole goes
sw4902B-ms98-a-0006 12.964750 17.284500 i think that uh we simply must start
sw4902B-ms98-a-0007 17.284500 19.634000 accepting everybody in the world
sw4902B-ms98-a-0008 19.634000 24.622250 uh i there just is not gonna be room for all of us we don't have jobs now
sw4902B-ms98-a-0009 24.622250 31.152500 i i think uh i think when we come to a time of recession that it's particularly important that we shut our doors at that time
sw4902B-ms98-a-0010 31.152500 34.359375 um [noise] hope you're one of the employed right now
sw4902B-ms98-a-0011 34.359375 36.904125 i am one of the unemployed right now
sw4902B-ms98-a-0012 36.904125 40.620875 i was a systems analyst and programmer for an oil company
sw4902B-ms98-a-0013 40.620875 42.575125 and uh
sw4902B-ms98-a-0014 42.575125 49.830500 i applied for one set of jobs with a company here in Dallas that they had two hundred openings but they had two thousand applications
sw4902B-ms98-a-0015 49.830500 56.701625 and i know that there are a lot of foreigners uh here y[ou]- you know doing my line of work
sw4902B-ms98-a-0016 56.701625 60.591375 and of course i'm not perfectly happy about not having a job
sw4902B-ms98-a-0017 60.591375 62.555750 so how do you feel
sw4902B-ms98-a-0018 62.555750 112.590125 [silence]
sw4902B-ms98-a-0019 112.590125 114.355375 right
sw4902B-ms98-a-0020 114.355375 143.028500 [silence]
sw4902B-ms98-a-0021 143.028500 145.656750 okay and i think you're right in both cases
sw4902B-ms98-a-0022 145.656750 169.505000 [silence]
sw4902B-ms98-a-0023 169.505000 174.243000 and i think probably it's pretty important right there how do you feel about Haitian immigration
sw4902B-ms98-a-0024 174.243000 206.130000 [silence]
sw4902B-ms98-a-0025 206.130000 207.923875 actually
sw4902B-ms98-a-0026 207.923875 212.993875 actually i feel [noise] that if we accepted these people
sw4902B-ms98-a-0027 212.993875 216.917000 that we would eventually have almost the total population here
sw4902B-ms98-a-0028 216.917000 223.717750 and it would have nothing to do with political situations it would have to do with poverty
sw4902B-ms98-a-0029 223.717750 230.297500 [silence]
sw4902B-ms98-a-0030 230.297500 234.310000 oh my gosh have you been to have you been to Southern Florida

sw4902B-ms98-a-0032 239.862375 246.539375 well i mean and the two of them_1 together i mean we can it's just as well [laughter] you know it's hardly America anymore
sw4902B-ms98-a-0033 246.539375 263.270125 [silence]
sw4902B-ms98-a-0034 263.270125 267.246750 but there's some differences in the immigrants
sw4902B-ms98-a-0035 267.246750 273.328750 that that we're getting now well in i particularly have a problem with the illegal immigration
sw4902B-ms98-a-0036 273.328750 277.688750 i think probably y[our]- your a great deal of what you say is true about the legals
sw4902B-ms98-a-0037 277.688750 285.274875 but uh the majority of the illegal immigration we're getting now they do not come here to blend into America
sw4902B-ms98-a-0038 285.274875 289.123375 uh they they don't bother to learn our language
sw4902B-ms98-a-0039 289.123375 298.562000 and uh [noise] first of all th[ey've]- they've i'm sorry this i really feel strongly about this we send a lot of money to Mexico
