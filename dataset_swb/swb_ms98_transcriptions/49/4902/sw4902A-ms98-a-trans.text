sw4902A-ms98-a-0013 55.914750 57.180125 uh-huh
sw4902A-ms98-a-0014 57.180125 59.720625 [silence]
sw4902A-ms98-a-0015 59.720625 61.006875 right
sw4902A-ms98-a-0016 61.006875 63.302625 [silence]
sw4902A-ms98-a-0017 63.302625 67.652750 well i'm a little bit ambivalent the problem with uh
sw4902A-ms98-a-0018 67.652750 76.865125 and i think one of the problems with immigration policy is like any other political problem is that people are not willing to discuss it uh in
sw4902A-ms98-a-0019 76.865125 87.872875 in terms of what uh really is driving it they're not willing to tell the truth the same way with um uh issues of uh race and things like that
sw4902A-ms98-a-0020 87.872875 90.578125 [noise] i mean right now
sw4902A-ms98-a-0021 90.578125 100.052625 um i believe there are two policies that uh that the government uses to modulate immigration three actually
sw4902A-ms98-a-0022 100.052625 106.727125 one is at the high end uh they always wanna be able to um do some brain draining
sw4902A-ms98-a-0023 106.727125 120.309125 they'd always like to be able to attract the uh Einsteins or the Professor Chou or you know they'd like to be able to get the top people in any field and so they can almost always find room for someone like that
sw4902A-ms98-a-0024 120.309125 122.247500 at the bottom end
sw4902A-ms98-a-0025 122.247500 124.087375 they um
sw4902A-ms98-a-0026 124.087375 135.783125 are always willing to um let in cheap labor [noise] if it lowers the cost of doing business in some particular area and has strong support from the powerful people in that area
sw4902A-ms98-a-0027 135.783125 142.509625 those are two [noise] things that i think are going on although they i- i i don't think the politicians would tell you that 
sw4902A-ms98-a-0028 142.509625 144.738375 [silence]
sw4902A-ms98-a-0029 144.738375 152.681500 and then the third thing [noise] is uh the political aspect of uh uh letting steam come out from under the lid in Mexico
sw4902A-ms98-a-0030 152.681500 153.697875 [noise]
sw4902A-ms98-a-0031 153.697875 160.458875 they cannot close off the Mexican border not because it's physically impossible but because the explosion that would take place in Mexico would be uh
sw4902A-ms98-a-0032 160.458875 167.994625 uh would spill over to this country so they keep allowing um the pressure cooker to um
sw4902A-ms98-a-0033 167.994625 169.446125 let off steam
sw4902A-ms98-a-0034 169.446125 174.371500 [silence]
sw4902A-ms98-a-0035 174.371500 180.390875 uh [noise] that's one of the few things i [laughter-guess] i found myself in agreement with Pat Buchanan
sw4902A-ms98-a-0036 180.390875 181.570000 [noise]
sw4902A-ms98-a-0037 181.570000 192.509500 i think they're very difficult group to integrate into uh society they're very difficult um group to find jobs and uh and uh places for
sw4902A-ms98-a-0038 192.509500 201.136375 and so um um i don't deny that we may have been involved in causing the problem that uh in that they're pretty miserable where they are
sw4902A-ms98-a-0039 201.136375 203.890750 but i'm not to sympathetic about um
sw4902A-ms98-a-0040 203.890750 206.385625 letting large numbers of Haitians in
sw4902A-ms98-a-0041 206.385625 216.840750 [silence]
sw4902A-ms98-a-0042 216.840750 218.061625 yeah
sw4902A-ms98-a-0043 218.061625 223.094500 [silence]
sw4902A-ms98-a-0044 223.094500 224.515250 right
sw4902A-ms98-a-0045 224.515250 233.592375 but if you let them_1 yeah if you let them_1 in a million at a time it wouldn't make that you know it wouldn't make that big a bulge in the population but po[litically]- politically and economically
sw4902A-ms98-a-0046 233.592375 241.502875 yeah well i know about it uh i mean it's it is now with Haitians the way it was with Cubans uh twenty years ago
sw4902A-ms98-a-0047 241.502875 246.018125 [silence]
sw4902A-ms98-a-0048 246.018125 250.960125 on the other hand you know i[t]- the ironic thing about this is that there's
sw4902A-ms98-a-0049 250.960125 257.291875 nobody more full of the [laughter-entrepreneurial] [laughter-American] spirit than a first generation [laughter-immigrant] [laughter]
sw4902A-ms98-a-0050 257.291875 264.127000 so there's uh uh there's a lot to be said for having a steady stream of people who know how it is someplace else coming in
sw4902A-ms98-a-0051 264.127000 269.347625 [silence]
sw4902A-ms98-a-0052 269.347625 270.558125 right
