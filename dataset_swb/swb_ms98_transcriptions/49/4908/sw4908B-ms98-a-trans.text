sw4908B-ms98-a-0002 1.042750 28.152250 [silence]
sw4908B-ms98-a-0003 28.152250 29.750375 that sounds
sw4908B-ms98-a-0004 29.750375 34.431750 [silence]
sw4908B-ms98-a-0005 34.431750 38.522500 but i gather you do not separate uh the bottles and cans
sw4908B-ms98-a-0006 38.522500 39.625500 [silence]
sw4908B-ms98-a-0007 39.625500 41.002125 uh-huh
sw4908B-ms98-a-0008 41.002125 60.093000 [silence]
sw4908B-ms98-a-0009 60.093000 61.824875 yes
sw4908B-ms98-a-0010 61.824875 68.465750 yes i know not only have i come to Washington but um i find it very amusing that uh the
sw4908B-ms98-a-0011 68.465750 81.145000 thing that was just instituted here is very similar that is we also have blue bins we also separate newspapers from all of the other stuff which goes into the bin and gets separated in the truck
sw4908B-ms98-a-0012 81.145000 95.890625 and uh land fill space is indeed the driving factor here and in fact uh despite all of our open space out here land fill space is still um very hard to come by
sw4908B-ms98-a-0013 95.890625 98.424000 [silence]
sw4908B-ms98-a-0014 98.424000 100.174625 uh
sw4908B-ms98-a-0015 100.174625 106.827250 [silence]
sw4908B-ms98-a-0016 106.827250 110.588000 ah but if somebody can make a regulation about it they will
sw4908B-ms98-a-0017 110.588000 117.599500 [silence]
sw4908B-ms98-a-0018 117.599500 120.318125 [noise] well um
sw4908B-ms98-a-0019 120.318125 130.644125 [laughter-yes] other than nuking it um in fact Los Alamos uh has uh done a fair amount of research uh in recycling things in general
sw4908B-ms98-a-0020 130.644125 145.560750 um it it involves for instance um creating biological organisms which can remove heavy elements like Selenium and barium and uh other things from
sw4908B-ms98-a-0021 145.560750 155.614125 uh waste material in general and um and purify the waste of specific uh uh nasty elements
sw4908B-ms98-a-0022 155.614125 163.106375 [silence]
sw4908B-ms98-a-0023 163.106375 164.969000 [vocalized-noise]
sw4908B-ms98-a-0024 164.969000 172.512750 and the other thing that just was in the local news bulletin was somebody has uh
sw4908B-ms98-a-0025 172.512750 184.150375 [vocalized-noise] made some special um polymers that have the ability to uh make certain Actinide elements adhere to them um
sw4908B-ms98-a-0026 184.150375 196.648250 uh they've uh looked at uh Plutonium and uranium and uh some other similar things to try to remove those from radio active waste
sw4908B-ms98-a-0027 196.648250 209.411375 and again this is driven by all of the documentation and uh E S and H uh uh considerations that uh people are uh worrying about i think much more than they should
sw4908B-ms98-a-0028 209.411375 221.839375 actually i've been involved in recycling for long before it became fashionable back when i was in graduate school i did all of the recycling of the um paper from the computer center
sw4908B-ms98-a-0029 221.839375 229.857250 and uh in fact i think i was the first person in our department to have my thesis published on recyclable pa[per]- recycled paper
sw4908B-ms98-a-0030 229.857250 231.817750 [laughter]
sw4908B-ms98-a-0031 231.817750 248.681000 [silence]
sw4908B-ms98-a-0032 248.681000 250.979375 i think that's a wonderful idea
sw4908B-ms98-a-0033 250.979375 255.815375 [silence]
sw4908B-ms98-a-0034 255.815375 265.926750 [noise] the only alternative i would see is uh and this would actually be a little more workable since weighing everybody's garbage would be a real pain
sw4908B-ms98-a-0035 265.926750 276.613625 uh if you did it by volume rather than by weight it would uh speak more directly to the space need than the land fill
sw4908B-ms98-a-0036 276.613625 290.787375 and it would also cause people to compact their garbage more uh and uh and limiting the volume is probably a little bit closer to the real problem than limiting the weight
sw4908B-ms98-a-0037 290.787375 299.170000 [silence]
