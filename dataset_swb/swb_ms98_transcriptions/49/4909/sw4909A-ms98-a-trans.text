sw4909A-ms98-a-0002 0.279375 1.993125 it looks like um
sw4909A-ms98-a-0003 1.993125 5.017750 we're going to have um a um
sw4909A-ms98-a-0004 5.017750 8.495250 sort of a third party movement on our hands in the fall
sw4909A-ms98-a-0005 8.495250 9.973500 and uh
sw4909A-ms98-a-0006 9.973500 12.993125 i guess the last time that happen was uh
sw4909A-ms98-a-0007 12.993125 17.668000 well i guess it was Anderson in seventy two and then there was Wallace in sixty
sw4909A-ms98-a-0008 17.668000 19.227000 eighty or whenever it was
sw4909A-ms98-a-0009 19.227000 24.989250 [noise]
sw4909A-ms98-a-0010 24.989250 26.666375 i guess the
sw4909A-ms98-a-0011 26.666375 34.980250 what i see behind it this this this uh maybe it's always true of third party movements but this one seems to be almost entirely negative
sw4909A-ms98-a-0012 34.980250 38.995250 almost completely a reaction to uh um
sw4909A-ms98-a-0013 38.995250 44.992125 uh failure of the other two parties rather than anything positive that's uh represented
sw4909A-ms98-a-0014 44.992125 64.978875 [silence]
sw4909A-ms98-a-0015 64.978875 74.004375 yeah i think there's absolutely no political philosophy the only thing that uh Perot um seems to has to offer is that uh he's a doer
sw4909A-ms98-a-0016 74.004375 74.778625 [noise]
sw4909A-ms98-a-0017 74.778625 81.292000 and since most people agree on what needs to be done but nobody can figure out how to do it he's just going to say uh
sw4909A-ms98-a-0018 81.292000 85.150375 i'm a CEO i know how to tell people to do things and get them_1 done
sw4909A-ms98-a-0019 85.150375 91.979125 which is uh pretty attractive and when uh Congress can't seem to be able to get anything done
sw4909A-ms98-a-0020 91.979125 108.978375 [silence]
sw4909A-ms98-a-0021 108.978375 110.785000 uh-huh

sw4909A-ms98-a-0025 129.718625 131.302125 yeah
sw4909A-ms98-a-0026 131.302125 133.732000 well i think um
sw4909A-ms98-a-0027 133.732000 147.949125 it's it's a reaction to what's what's happened over the last ten or fifteen years where um the parties really just seem to be intent on blocking the other party from getting any further the the uh
sw4909A-ms98-a-0028 147.949125 160.999625 the Democrats want to get the Republicans out of the White House and Republicans want to try to get control of Congress but they don't seem to have any really big ideas or sweeping um vision of where things should go
sw4909A-ms98-a-0029 160.999625 163.743125 and now things are are so stalled 
sw4909A-ms98-a-0030 163.743125 165.499250 that uh
sw4909A-ms98-a-0031 165.499250 169.760000 out of uh pure frustration comes along with uh
sw4909A-ms98-a-0032 169.760000 172.491375 uh a guy who says he can get things done
sw4909A-ms98-a-0033 172.491375 177.470000 so maybe he is part of a um a more general
sw4909A-ms98-a-0034 177.470000 180.530250 trend in politics over the last twenty years
sw4909A-ms98-a-0035 180.530250 181.741000 [noise]
sw4909A-ms98-a-0036 181.741000 182.997125 the um

sw4909A-ms98-a-0038 184.488375 188.987500 i don't know those of us who weren't too happy with the Reagan years saw that as a
sw4909A-ms98-a-0039 188.987500 195.269125 as just a um [vocalized-noise] of selfishness and um
sw4909A-ms98-a-0040 195.269125 201.471500 government just got out of the way there wasn't no prevailing philosophy except do what you can to get you something for yourself

sw4909A-ms98-a-0054 269.697250 276.517625 yeah what i see is all tactics and no strategy um that and uh
sw4909A-ms98-a-0055 276.517625 282.155875 it's i mean it's fun to watch on a day by day basis but it doesn't get anything done in the long run

sw4909A-ms98-a-0057 282.818875 288.830125 if all you're interested in is making the other guy look bad and making yourself look good you don't really accomplish anything
sw4909A-ms98-a-0058 288.830125 295.994875 in the long run the infrastructure deteriorates and people kind of lose their uh sense of a of purpose
