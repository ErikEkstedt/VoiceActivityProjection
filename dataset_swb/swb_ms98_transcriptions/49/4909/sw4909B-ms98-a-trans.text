sw4909B-ms98-a-0009 43.985125 54.734875 yeah i [vocalized-noise] that's a pretty good point i hadn't thought about it like that but yeah it's i guess it's not really um a start up with uh
sw4909B-ms98-a-0010 54.734875 65.993000 necessarily new ideas and you know this is my positive outlook but rather uh saying well uh i'm just not very happy with uh with the other two parties seem to be going type of thing
sw4909B-ms98-a-0011 65.993000 73.498500 [silence]

sw4909B-ms98-a-0016 90.985750 105.485375 yeah i guess read a political cartoon uh must be probably about a week ago now or maybe you saw it i don't know how widespread this was but it showed uh Perot like revealing his
sw4909B-ms98-a-0017 105.485375 116.668750 you know what he stood for or whatever it's kind of like he had showed him open up his overcoat and [vocalized-noise] open he open they [drawed/drew] him um they drew him [laughter] opening up his overcoat and inside was another overcoat
sw4909B-ms98-a-0018 116.668750 130.495875 so it's like you know his he hasn't really he hasn't really said very much of what he stands for or what you know he's kind of pretty much [vocalized-noise] vowed to saying you know i'll get i'll get this done and get that done you know but what is this and that type of thing
sw4909B-ms98-a-0019 130.495875 131.996000 but

sw4909B-ms98-a-0029 200.711250 213.995500 yeah it it it seems it seems as though that that's definitely definitely a point of the two parties pretty much trying to block each other and there's been a definite i'd say definite loss in actual
sw4909B-ms98-a-0030 213.995500 221.051125 you know ideals and there's just there's too much each side you know where there's Republican or Democrat both of them like trying to
sw4909B-ms98-a-0031 221.051125 230.234250 you know either play to the hands of like what the dominant philosophy is uh not not not not dominant but like old style philosophy of each each
sw4909B-ms98-a-0032 230.234250 242.496250 in each party and not really coming up with a new ideas or the or maybe i mean it it you know it's time for maybe a definite new vision and and what's going on which may be you know a blend of both
sw4909B-ms98-a-0033 242.496250 256.492375 you know maybe both parties or you know a little bit of this a little bit of that which may not fall into the lines of either party but you know just doesn't seem as though either party wants to do very much that rocks the boat or maybe maybe says oh its time for a little bit of you know
sw4909B-ms98-a-0034 256.492375 271.269750 things aren't going very well oh in the big picture maybe right now Congress getting better or it's maybe it's getting worse or who knows but you know it's just like a little ripple in the ocean it's [vocalized-noise] know some some somebody got to look down the road a ways and say well what's going to go on
