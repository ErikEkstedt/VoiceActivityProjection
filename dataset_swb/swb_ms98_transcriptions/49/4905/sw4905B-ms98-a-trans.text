sw4905B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.147000 [noise]
sw4905B-ms98-a-0002 1.147000 7.454375 [silence]
sw4905B-ms98-a-0003 7.454375 11.538375 [laughter] [laughter-right]
sw4905B-ms98-a-0004 11.538375 25.242250 [silence]
sw4905B-ms98-a-0005 25.242250 27.463875 yeah yeah definitely
sw4905B-ms98-a-0006 27.463875 37.554125 [silence]
sw4905B-ms98-a-0007 37.554125 51.378625 yeah yes i've had a variety of different jobs with of various types um in the computer field and so seen a variety of different types of benefits um i've worked for for [vocalized-noise] for awhile and
sw4905B-ms98-a-0008 51.378625 61.261500 they are you know really um an academic type of place and then i've worked with regular you know industry type places and then with others that are kind of half way between and stuff so i've seen a wide range of
sw4905B-ms98-a-0009 61.261500 68.170125 both you know {nonsalary} type benefits and other stuff you know like health care that's either fully or partially paid and
sw4905B-ms98-a-0010 68.170125 75.782250 you know some have like bonuses and others have had lots of vacation time but not much o[f]- other types of benefits and
sw4905B-ms98-a-0011 75.782250 80.505000 so yeah i would i'd say health care is way up there especially for anybody with kids um
sw4905B-ms98-a-0012 80.505000 86.346625 and that's one of the big things that we always look at you know when we when i think about tak[ing]- changing jobs is you know
sw4905B-ms98-a-0013 86.346625 93.095250 you know what kind of health care they have and does the company pay for it you know all or partially or how does that work
sw4905B-ms98-a-0014 93.095250 98.110375 and um also um vacation time too is a is a big one for me
sw4905B-ms98-a-0015 98.110375 104.943125 um and i guess support for whatever whatever other you know kinds of professional activities you have at you know work
sw4905B-ms98-a-0016 104.943125 109.352250 um because_1 i've been at places which offer a lot of support and others that don't offer any
sw4905B-ms98-a-0017 109.352250 120.356375 and some that sometimes that's coincided with a place that offers more vacation time though so that's not so bad um you know it's kind of a give and take kind of thing i think
sw4905B-ms98-a-0018 120.356375 134.510000 um i say that uh health care is probably definitely number one though uh you can wind up just l[osing]- you know l[osing]- all your salary can't [laughter-can't] [laughter-even] begin to pay for what you can wind up losing you know with a major illness or something
sw4905B-ms98-a-0019 134.510000 135.779375 um
sw4905B-ms98-a-0020 135.779375 143.838250 [silence]
sw4905B-ms98-a-0021 143.838250 145.435750 yeah
sw4905B-ms98-a-0022 145.435750 153.114625 [silence]
sw4905B-ms98-a-0023 153.114625 154.691750 uh-huh
sw4905B-ms98-a-0024 154.691750 156.599125 ye[ah]-
sw4905B-ms98-a-0025 156.599125 163.918750 yeah flexible hours are are pretty important to me as well um because_1 that makes a big difference my wife works part time
sw4905B-ms98-a-0026 163.918750 170.771125 and she works um as a assistant manager in a fabric store and so she works a lot of evenings and weekends
sw4905B-ms98-a-0027 170.771125 179.513750 and so two days a week i um manage to get home early enough to meet the kids from the bus [noise] because_1 she wor[ks]- you know goes in early those days and works like you know noon till close
sw4905B-ms98-a-0028 179.513750 182.112750 um so we have [vocalized-noise] [noise]
sw4905B-ms98-a-0029 182.112750 186.643250 yeah and being on a you know rigid schedule wouldn't there wouldn't be anyway to do that at all
sw4905B-ms98-a-0030 186.643250 201.394875 and i think it's kind of neat to be able to spend the afternoons with the kids occasionally too because_1 i mean usually you know you go to work before they're awake or as they're getting up for school and you get home and it's already dark unless it's summer time you know and even if it's summer sometimes you get home so late that there's you know you can't do anything with them_1
sw4905B-ms98-a-0031 201.394875 208.022375 and especially in the winter i mean you ge[t]- get up in the dark and come home in the [laughter-dark] [laughter-you] [laughter-know] it's like it's like a vampire [laughter-sometimes]
sw4905B-ms98-a-0032 208.022375 219.075875 [silence]
sw4905B-ms98-a-0033 219.075875 220.300875 yeah
sw4905B-ms98-a-0034 220.300875 224.085125 [silence]
sw4905B-ms98-a-0035 224.085125 226.344500 um a lot of it to i guess is
sw4905B-ms98-a-0036 226.344500 227.407375 [silence]
sw4905B-ms98-a-0037 227.407375 230.455375 yeah i think some it is how the uh
sw4905B-ms98-a-0038 230.455375 236.447625 you know i guess it's not really a direct benefit but how you um performance is rated and stuff like that at work
sw4905B-ms98-a-0039 236.447625 241.826500 because_1 i've been uh especially in large corporations you can really you know wind up getting
sw4905B-ms98-a-0040 241.826500 249.911875 having you know real problems i've found out i've worked for a few you know several thousand plus [noise] you know type companies
sw4905B-ms98-a-0041 249.911875 254.312375 and it especially if you're doing like professional work where th[ere]- you know it's kind of
sw4905B-ms98-a-0042 254.312375 260.829750 [noise] ethereal as to what you're doing you know if you're like i've i work with uh computer systems a lot
sw4905B-ms98-a-0043 260.829750 265.183375 so it's kind of hard to say you know if you're a you know brick layer somebody can
sw4905B-ms98-a-0044 265.183375 273.009000 look and see you know well yeah you laid you know fifteen thousand bricks today and they were all straight and your building didn't fall down [noise] you know yeah you did a great job
sw4905B-ms98-a-0045 273.009000 283.243125 if you build computer systems like well you know what does that computer program really do you know or if especially if you write like papers you know or do design studies or something it's real hard to rate something like that
sw4905B-ms98-a-0046 283.243125 292.490375 it's like being a painter or you know or something an artist it's like well jeez how do you really rate you know Michelangelo you know [noise] how would you tell if he was you know really good or [noise] so-so or whatever
