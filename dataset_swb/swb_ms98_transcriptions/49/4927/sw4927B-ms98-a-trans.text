sw4927B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 4.966875 [noise] okay uh mandatory service yeah i don't think it's a good idea
sw4927B-ms98-a-0002 4.966875 13.761375 uh because we'd have to change the Constitution to [vocalized-noise] to uh allow uh involuntary servitude uh in service to the government
sw4927B-ms98-a-0003 13.761375 20.898250 and i'm not sure that we could do that in such a way that we could avoid winding up a slave state
sw4927B-ms98-a-0004 20.898250 23.838625 it's i like the idea
sw4927B-ms98-a-0005 23.838625 37.275125 well [noise] i like the idea of volun[tary]- voluntary support i mean they might be able to ah say that anyone who does that uh gets certain benefits that [noise] would not be available to someone who didn't do it
sw4927B-ms98-a-0006 37.275125 50.531500 but to use force um really sets us a a it it essentially says that your body there's a title to your body and that title belongs to the government and you are not a free American citizen
sw4927B-ms98-a-0007 50.531500 53.172375 the idea itself of service is good
sw4927B-ms98-a-0008 53.172375 66.735125 and when someone is say out of high school and not sure about college or out of college and not ready to go into a career and they're not committed to huge amounts of debt that's the best time to be able to do work that doesn't pay very well
sw4927B-ms98-a-0009 66.735125 70.743375 [silence]
sw4927B-ms98-a-0010 70.743375 74.035000 yeah unless it were tied directly
sw4927B-ms98-a-0011 74.035000 86.047000 you know if someone were studying something uh let's say take something obscure somebody was studying economics the State Department could offer to send them to the Soviet Union for two years to teach them_1 how to run their country
sw4927B-ms98-a-0012 86.047000 89.644625 [laughter] as an extreme example right
sw4927B-ms98-a-0013 89.644625 90.714875 [silence]
sw4927B-ms98-a-0014 90.714875 100.227500 but in reality i think what you would wind up with is a political football where they would see all these body counts that they can use to for their own will and i just don't think it would work
sw4927B-ms98-a-0015 100.227500 107.365500 [silence]
sw4927B-ms98-a-0016 107.365500 121.147750 well they're not it's been suggested and it's sort of a topic of debate every time it comes up it gets voted down the uh people who are pro-military oppose it because they don't want people to have the right to opt out of the military into something else
sw4927B-ms98-a-0017 121.147750 131.606125 and the people who are pro-constitution oppose it on the grounds that the government shouldn't even have the right to enforce you to join the military unless the United States is actually under attack
sw4927B-ms98-a-0018 131.606125 141.494250 [noise] so mostly it's just kind of one of those things that goes away [noise] ah they've got a noisy line
sw4927B-ms98-a-0019 141.494250 144.939000 [laughter-yeah] well it's somewhere between here and there
sw4927B-ms98-a-0020 144.939000 147.342125 [silence]
sw4927B-ms98-a-0021 147.342125 159.040125 uh oh eighteen the draft age yeah [noise] wait a min[ute]- yeah [noise] let me see if i can get on a cleaner line if it's my line um [noise] 
sw4927B-ms98-a-0022 159.040125 162.578375 [noise] yeah it is my line i was on a radio phone
sw4927B-ms98-a-0023 162.578375 173.456375 all right that's better yeah no there they they figure that they can draft you at eighteen age they usually do draft you at nineteen and that's the age they're looking at
sw4927B-ms98-a-0024 173.456375 184.607750 and of course they're this one the women would be equally grabbed and they're almost on the verge of saying that you if you're gonna draft men you're gonna have to draft women and you're gonna have to put them_1 in front of the guns just the same
sw4927B-ms98-a-0025 184.607750 190.269875 so uh if you're near that age or you know somebody who is uh you know be aware of that
sw4927B-ms98-a-0026 190.269875 192.835625 [silence]
sw4927B-ms98-a-0027 192.835625 194.523375 [laughter-yeah]
sw4927B-ms98-a-0028 194.523375 196.233375 [silence]
sw4927B-ms98-a-0029 196.233375 198.166125 oh okay
sw4927B-ms98-a-0030 198.166125 205.830375 yep and you don't want them sent off to the Middle East to help defend Bush from Saddam after Bush gets done arming him
sw4927B-ms98-a-0031 205.830375 209.827125 [laughter-you] [laughter-know] we only find out about that a year after the fact
sw4927B-ms98-a-0032 209.827125 217.147375 so it's another thing when in doubt don't trust the government at all [laughter-it's] really reached that point
sw4927B-ms98-a-0033 217.147375 223.464500 hey you're in Perot country i'm really thinking that this guy might be good for us
sw4927B-ms98-a-0034 223.464500 231.654625 i've been it it seemed dangerous i thought is the guy a closet fascist and then i find out that he helped rid the United States of the Gablers
sw4927B-ms98-a-0035 231.654625 236.530500 [silence]
sw4927B-ms98-a-0036 236.530500 237.948625 yeah
sw4927B-ms98-a-0037 237.948625 239.785250 [silence]
sw4927B-ms98-a-0038 239.785250 253.509750 [vocalized-noise] well i'm in the computer biz too so i know he's well known in the industry they uh i- i have high hopes for him and i think that you [laughter-know] if he could get people interested and encouraged and to believe that the government was actually for us then i'm for him
sw4927B-ms98-a-0039 253.509750 262.682875 i mean in the Democratic primary i'm gonna vote for Brown just because_1 i kind of like Brown and his attitude but when uh when it really comes down in the fall i think i know where it's gonna go
sw4927B-ms98-a-0040 262.682875 268.404875 [silence]
sw4927B-ms98-a-0041 268.404875 269.663250 um-hum
sw4927B-ms98-a-0042 269.663250 271.821500 [silence]
sw4927B-ms98-a-0043 271.821500 273.322500 [laughter-yeah]
sw4927B-ms98-a-0044 273.322500 274.733250 you know this
sw4927B-ms98-a-0045 274.733250 277.576750 [silence]

sw4927B-ms98-a-0047 286.622125 289.922375 [silence]
sw4927B-ms98-a-0048 289.922375 291.262750 uh-huh
sw4927B-ms98-a-0049 291.262750 293.731250 [silence]
