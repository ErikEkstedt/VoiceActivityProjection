sw3379B-ms98-a-0003 4.328250 7.551250 do you know i don't know what to think i i [vocalized-noise]
sw3379B-ms98-a-0004 7.551250 22.125500 the person i am i want to believe that it's an honest effort i want to believe that that they really are trying to change that that maybe they are headed for a more democratic society and i i want to believe it's all okay
sw3379B-ms98-a-0005 22.125500 28.915750 but then there's that side of me that says [noise] yeah but they've put on faces before
sw3379B-ms98-a-0006 28.915750 41.643000 and never to this extent though you know so so it's like there is a struggle within me going do do i be open minded and give them_1 the benefit of the doubt which is kind of my basic personality you know i i trust people i'll do that
sw3379B-ms98-a-0007 41.643000 45.890250 or do i keep on going well we'll wait and see [laughter]
sw3379B-ms98-a-0008 45.890250 69.660875 [silence]
sw3379B-ms98-a-0009 69.660875 75.347125 yeah that it's not just Amer[ican]- uh or western society telling you i[t]- it's it doesn't work 
sw3379B-ms98-a-0010 75.347125 84.289750 you know [vocalized-noise] they've always said you know the the Soviet people were united we believe this and maybe they're seeing that no no hey we don't believe this you know
sw3379B-ms98-a-0011 84.289750 89.137875 but it's still you know i guess i keep that one part of me that's like well
sw3379B-ms98-a-0012 89.137875 96.898250 i don't know i want to trust them and i it's like i can't and maybe it's because you know we've had our own propaganda over the years i don't know
sw3379B-ms98-a-0013 96.898250 107.543000 [silence]
sw3379B-ms98-a-0014 107.543000 110.128250 and they probably do the same things
sw3379B-ms98-a-0015 110.128250 113.842750 you think the CIA doesn't spy i'm sure they do
sw3379B-ms98-a-0016 113.842750 123.682750 now the difference is we don't i do[n't]- i don't think we take people and kill them_1 just because they don't believe what we believe you know i think to that extent we don't go as far but i'm sure they lie 
sw3379B-ms98-a-0017 123.682750 125.696625 you [laughter-know]
sw3379B-ms98-a-0018 125.696625 127.612125 so

sw3379B-ms98-a-0026 158.400625 161.082375 yeah that's true
sw3379B-ms98-a-0027 161.082375 174.818125 [silence]
sw3379B-ms98-a-0028 174.818125 186.903000 [noise] and i'm not against them being concerned but i feel like we ought to be spending maybe the same time and effort and and energy into trying to solve our own or resolve our own
sw3379B-ms98-a-0029 186.903000 198.466500 you know i mean you know any any country that wants to be democratic i'm all for helping them_1 you know because i i understand that you know you're looking at United States as the biggest and longest supporter of that type of government
sw3379B-ms98-a-0030 198.466500 207.792125 but at the same time [vocalized-noise] i agree i don't think we can do it a[nd]- and just you know turn our backs or or be ignorant per se to the things that are happening here
sw3379B-ms98-a-0031 207.792125 256.750000 [silence]
sw3379B-ms98-a-0032 256.750000 262.640625 yeah we we we believe in what he's doing abroad but but like you said there's issues here too
sw3379B-ms98-a-0033 262.640625 274.006875 and [noise] but i i am encouraged by what's happening in the Soviet Union i'm encouraged by what's happened in you know the the iron curtain countries you know in in that block and
sw3379B-ms98-a-0034 274.006875 283.176500 and i think it's moved in the right direction i now i think sometimes people expect it to happen overnight you know it's not going to it didn't happen here overnight and it didn't happen here without a struggle
sw3379B-ms98-a-0035 283.176500 284.405125 you know
sw3379B-ms98-a-0036 284.405125 287.525875 and i- i think sometimes we forget that
sw3379B-ms98-a-0037 287.525875 293.293000 but i i i'd i have to say yes i'm you know i'm encouraged by the way it's going
sw3379B-ms98-a-0038 293.293000 294.761375 uh
