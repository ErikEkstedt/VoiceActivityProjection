sw3395A-ms98-a-0032 227.692250 231.509625 to me it isn't that interesting because it's
sw3395A-ms98-a-0033 231.509625 240.622250 generally not too much human interest stuff it's more the you know somebody died here or we had a fire here

sw3395A-ms98-a-0035 249.980875 262.999000 where the local news meant something to me because i could relate to the area or to the town or to the people but you know in in when you have a a Dallas Fort Worth market
