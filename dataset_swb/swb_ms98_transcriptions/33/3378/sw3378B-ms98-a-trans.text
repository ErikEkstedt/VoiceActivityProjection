sw3378B-ms98-a-0003 2.191875 11.616125 oh the last thing i had done or did let's see um [laughter] [laughter-was] getting a an old seventy eight Jeep Cherokee ready to trade in
sw3378B-ms98-a-0004 11.616125 13.176125 and uh
sw3378B-ms98-a-0005 13.176125 26.832000 so i was basically just going around and doing what i could do fixing door locks and checking the transfer case fluid and things like that i'm kind of a motor head myself so this topic's [laughter-actually] pretty good for me
sw3378B-ms98-a-0006 26.832000 36.604875 um i got a seventy Chevelle that i'm restoring too so it's uh there's constant work going on to that car 
sw3378B-ms98-a-0007 36.604875 38.864000 yeah yeah
sw3378B-ms98-a-0008 38.864000 47.451250 [silence]

sw3378B-ms98-a-0013 67.286750 68.898875 oh wow
sw3378B-ms98-a-0014 68.898875 73.286625 [silence]
sw3378B-ms98-a-0015 73.286625 74.607000 uh-huh
sw3378B-ms98-a-0016 74.607000 76.306875 [silence]
sw3378B-ms98-a-0017 76.306875 85.810875 right i mean that's some that's some serious work not only uh i mean you have to have a yeah i mean you have to have a knowledge of quite a few of the the systems there to to do that what i mean that
sw3378B-ms98-a-0018 85.810875 87.264750 bet you can
sw3378B-ms98-a-0019 87.264750 98.831125 [silence]
sw3378B-ms98-a-0020 98.831125 100.257000 yeah
sw3378B-ms98-a-0021 100.257000 104.501250 have you tried any like the Chilton's uh manuals
sw3378B-ms98-a-0022 104.501250 116.869750 oh i- i rec[ommend]- recommend them_1 i've uh use[d]- i uh i have a Chilton's manual on my Chevelle and every anytime i undertake anything it i s[tart]- start with that that book
sw3378B-ms98-a-0023 116.869750 129.662250 yeah yeah yeah they're they're pretty good um the only problem i've noticed with them_1 is that when i started working on cars i um [noise]
sw3378B-ms98-a-0024 129.662250 135.322000 uh didn't really have much knowledge of them_1 at all and and you know it's hard
sw3378B-ms98-a-0025 135.322000 144.995750 the language of mo[tor]- automotive mechanics is a language all it's own and just the names of some of the parts you know they tell you to put the wrench on something and
sw3378B-ms98-a-0026 144.995750 146.648000 you know
sw3378B-ms98-a-0027 146.648000 153.244625 yeah you know and it took a while before you figure out what everything is and uh
sw3378B-ms98-a-0028 153.244625 161.056625 and what you are supposed to be doing with it but i- i think it's a lot better than than starting from starting cold and that's for sure
sw3378B-ms98-a-0029 161.056625 162.424500 no
sw3378B-ms98-a-0030 162.424500 164.293875 [silence]
sw3378B-ms98-a-0031 164.293875 165.802875 yeah

sw3378B-ms98-a-0035 180.505500 182.501750 oh i know brake job
sw3378B-ms98-a-0036 182.501750 189.881125 [silence]
sw3378B-ms98-a-0037 189.881125 191.279375 right
sw3378B-ms98-a-0038 191.279375 198.121000 well i- i don't know i've get i've gotten the Chevelle i've did done the brakes all the way around it myself and uh 
sw3378B-ms98-a-0039 198.121000 207.629125 well th[is]- this one's got drum brakes though drum bra[kes]- drum brakes are a little bit tougher than disc brakes but um but still it's not anything that that
sw3378B-ms98-a-0040 207.629125 214.333750 you know it's just a matter of putting the parts in the right place and there isn't really anything you can do wrong to it um
sw3378B-ms98-a-0041 214.333750 227.745000 and those ones did have to have the lines bled though but but bleeding the lines is just a matter of uh you know just having somebody on the uh pumping the ped[al]- the brake pedal for you and when it's
sw3378B-ms98-a-0042 227.745000 229.285750 [silence]
sw3378B-ms98-a-0043 229.285750 232.105000 yeah yeah exactly [noise]
sw3378B-ms98-a-0044 232.105000 236.463625 [silence]
sw3378B-ms98-a-0045 236.463625 237.837625 sure

sw3378B-ms98-a-0050 245.560000 248.988375 yeah there's no not not too much trick for that
sw3378B-ms98-a-0051 248.988375 256.506000 they're uh buy i just this new vehicle i buy i just bought a ninety one GMC Sonoma which is a little pickup truck with a
sw3378B-ms98-a-0052 256.506000 262.569875 and i'm wondering when the time comes for the maintenance on this thing how much i'm gonna be able to do myself and
sw3378B-ms98-a-0053 262.569875 266.386750 how much is going to require all their diagnostics and all that
sw3378B-ms98-a-0054 266.386750 273.823750 it looks pretty simple i used to have an eighty five Chrysler Laser and this one certainly looks a lot more simple than than that motor
sw3378B-ms98-a-0055 273.823750 283.200750 but uh i haven't i haven't gotten into fuel injectors and things like that and that thing's fuel injected so i don't know what uh um
sw3378B-ms98-a-0056 283.200750 292.206500 how that will will be the only thing i've ever done on a fuel injector is replace the hose on it it was leaking so [laughter] i don't know
sw3378B-ms98-a-0057 292.206500 298.690000 i like the old cars open up the hood on my Chevelle and there's nothing under there but a big motor and uh [laughter] and you know no
