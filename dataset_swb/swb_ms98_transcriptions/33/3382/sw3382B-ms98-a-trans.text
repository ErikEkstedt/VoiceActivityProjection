sw3382B-ms98-a-0014 26.566875 38.909000 yeah i think it's pretty exciting that they can uh it'd be interesting to see they can find uh other planets that are that'd be more habitable to uh you know uh humans and uh
sw3382B-ms98-a-0015 38.909000 45.002250 yeah i think i would be very interested in space travel in the future if it's if it you know is at all possible

sw3382B-ms98-a-0019 53.298500 64.116625 well we know if the they make the advances that they've been making that uh maybe age will no longer age or even physical uh abilities may not be uh a barrier anymore
sw3382B-ms98-a-0020 64.116625 75.887000 [silence]
sw3382B-ms98-a-0021 75.887000 89.174625 [noise] yeah i agree uh as a matter of fact one of the ones that i had been to Houston to to you know to visit the uh space center out there and uh one of the big advances that we use every day now is velcro
sw3382B-ms98-a-0022 89.174625 90.938250 and tha[t]- tha[t]- that came
sw3382B-ms98-a-0023 90.938250 100.795375 uh well the space program was one of the big you know backers of that and it's amazing you know you har[d]- it's hard to imagine what life is like without it now

sw3382B-ms98-a-0041 165.340500 171.691500 yeah that that is uh that is something that'd be hard to think about i agree
sw3382B-ms98-a-0042 171.691500 179.722625 you know we like you say we're used to finite things and something that's infinite is just incomprehensible
sw3382B-ms98-a-0043 179.722625 183.139125 but uh yeah i would like to see them uh
sw3382B-ms98-a-0044 183.139125 191.310750 do more i[n]- that area make space travel more uh something that the ordinary person could uh en[joy]- enjoy

sw3382B-ms98-a-0048 199.212875 209.443625 [noise] yeah yeah that'd be true i wouldn't even mind being [laughter-yeah] not so much being first but just uh get out there and and just explore
sw3382B-ms98-a-0049 209.443625 218.244500 [noise] i think uh it's in everyone's nature to some degree to wanna get out and explore something they haven't or experience something new and different

sw3382B-ms98-a-0061 243.618125 256.499500 that's right that's right and if you're just content with being you know with the way things are then you know then then you must lead lead a pretty dull life [laughter] because_1 if you

sw3382B-ms98-a-0065 265.483375 277.490000 yeah i guess uh y[ou]- you don't really think about it too much uh i guess you're always finding newer ways and better ways of doing stuff but you it it's in a subconscious you don't 
sw3382B-ms98-a-0066 277.490000 287.947250 think you you know someone would make you sit down and write down what you know things that you've improved upon you probably wouldn't have a a pretty good list but you just don't think about them_1
sw3382B-ms98-a-0067 287.947250 290.690250 and that's true i think uh
sw3382B-ms98-a-0068 290.690250 299.522000 you know we've got different programs at work you know to to uh ma[ke]- make it visible to management that we're doing things better
