sw3327B-ms98-a-0024 76.882250 88.717625 yes i understand my last car repair actually had to do with brakes and it's one i did not do myself i took the car my i have a seventy nine El Dorado took it to be inspected
sw3327B-ms98-a-0025 88.717625 100.878875 and the parking brake failed so i got under there and messed with the the ten[sion]- that um that adjustment to make i[t]- t[o]- t[ighten]- tighten it up and that didn't do the trick and i got there and tried to
sw3327B-ms98-a-0026 100.878875 107.164500 but we well actually that wasn't even eventually the problem i i did a lot of things that i- i did everything that i could think to do
sw3327B-ms98-a-0027 107.164500 120.175375 and eventually i brought it up to a a place called Just Brakes and it turns out that there's a the parking brake i[n]- in the rear there's a there's disc brakes and the parking brake is a piston
sw3327B-ms98-a-0028 120.175375 128.899875 deal and because the parking brake hadn't been used in so many years the piston froze up so they ended up having to pound it out and one of them_1 they
sw3327B-ms98-a-0029 128.899875 141.025500 were able to get running uh kind of oiling it and playing with it and the other one they just it was just frozen solid th[e]- so i ended up having to buy one and altog[ether]- all total it was just under two hundred dollars believe it or not to get all that [laughter-done]

sw3327B-ms98-a-0034 167.649750 182.391375 well that is one problem but also these um these fast oil change places you just can't beat them_1 for sixteen bucks they'll not only will they change your oil in ten minutes and do a f[ine]- you know [vocalized-noise] good a job as i can do but they'll uh lube too [noise]
