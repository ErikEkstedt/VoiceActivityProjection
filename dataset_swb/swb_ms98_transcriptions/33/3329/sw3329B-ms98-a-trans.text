sw3329B-ms98-a-0003 5.104125 10.050500 well i think there are honest people in our government i think it's uh
sw3329B-ms98-a-0004 10.050500 17.320625 and we do have some checks and balances to keep it honest but i think it's always a real challenge to um
sw3329B-ms98-a-0005 17.320625 20.944625 make sure that we have people in there that we can count on
sw3329B-ms98-a-0006 20.944625 22.728625 to be honest
sw3329B-ms98-a-0007 22.728625 24.168375 [silence]
sw3329B-ms98-a-0008 24.168375 26.994750 [noise]

sw3329B-ms98-a-0010 36.459000 42.147000 yeah i think there are and have been some things that have been done to maybe
sw3329B-ms98-a-0011 42.147000 50.496625 make things better you know one thing is the opportunity on our income tax to um allow certain donations
sw3329B-ms98-a-0012 50.496625 60.655625 to uh be made because_1 a a lot of times i think you know people anybody that runs for a political office has got to either be independently wealthy
sw3329B-ms98-a-0013 60.655625 65.189750 or they've got to be beholding to somebody to help them_1

sw3329B-ms98-a-0015 66.222875 67.410625 yeah
sw3329B-ms98-a-0016 67.410625 76.060125 and so you know i think [noise] if if there were ways that we could get away from that and let just the common man be able to run
sw3329B-ms98-a-0017 76.060125 78.085375 [noise] for office that that

sw3329B-ms98-a-0027 122.908625 132.547000 yeah that's more public service i guess than public office and it's been a real eye-opener to us course i feel that he's completely honest and
sw3329B-ms98-a-0028 132.547000 136.083750 what all and there have peop[le]- been people that have said
