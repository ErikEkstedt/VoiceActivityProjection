sw3399A-ms98-a-0041 179.459250 184.017000 like i said it's a broad category it's just uh not economical but yeah
sw3399A-ms98-a-0042 184.017000 187.358625 uh even attitudes
sw3399A-ms98-a-0043 187.358625 189.487750 [silence]
sw3399A-ms98-a-0044 189.487750 193.133625 on on clothing and stuff uh i know
sw3399A-ms98-a-0045 193.133625 205.680500 yeah i i i know a lot of the things that that we wear men wear now a days were would've been considered uh feminine uh many years ago
sw3399A-ms98-a-0046 205.680500 213.393000 but the uh i know it's been it was hard for me at first but now i kind of like you know a lot of the bright colors
sw3399A-ms98-a-0047 213.393000 221.207000 i mean like i think i used to be more uh conservative and just your basic colors but now i i do like some of these uh
sw3399A-ms98-a-0048 221.207000 223.918500 brighter fluorescent colors
sw3399A-ms98-a-0049 223.918500 234.392750 [silence]

sw3399A-ms98-a-0052 238.654750 247.135500 yeah i i i guess uh the best thing i like to see from the sixties and seventies is of course is the mini skirt of course
sw3399A-ms98-a-0053 247.135500 260.206000 [laughter] one of the nice things but uh yeah i i i don't think that there's anything as original it's it's all based on uh one of the past styles they just uh
sw3399A-ms98-a-0054 260.206000 263.864500 make their uh circle and come back again
sw3399A-ms98-a-0055 263.864500 270.730750 so if you hang onto your clothes long enough uh they'll they'll be back in style in a few years [laughter]

sw3399A-ms98-a-0059 280.335250 286.344250 well i think li[ke]- thinking back i think the only style i hope doesn't come back is bell bottoms
sw3399A-ms98-a-0060 286.344250 288.475750 [silence]
sw3399A-ms98-a-0061 288.475750 295.340750 [laughter] i guess when i look at pictures of myself in the bell bottoms i say God
