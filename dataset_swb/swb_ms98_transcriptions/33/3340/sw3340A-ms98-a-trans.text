sw3340A-ms98-a-0035 167.358125 176.435875 and um [noise] though he's alive today and everything worked out fine it it it happened about two blocks from the high school and
sw3340A-ms98-a-0036 176.435875 184.156500 a friend came and got me and i was there and i could smell the dope and i could see the beer cans from the guy that hit him
sw3340A-ms98-a-0037 184.156500 196.267625 and nothing ever happened and from from that point on i became so anti-drunk driving you know now i think people should be allowed to drink i think that's an adult responsibility whatever
sw3340A-ms98-a-0038 196.267625 209.138125 but i really uh i'm so anti-drunk driving and and drugs have uh long lasting effects and i i guess when i younger i was um [noise] probably a little more liberal on the subject
sw3340A-ms98-a-0039 209.138125 220.996125 yeah an[d]- but as i've a[s]- a[s]- as soon as that happened i guess when i was eighteen years old if you'd have asked me i'd have thought it was fine but i[t]- by the time i was nineteen my opinion had totally changed yeah
