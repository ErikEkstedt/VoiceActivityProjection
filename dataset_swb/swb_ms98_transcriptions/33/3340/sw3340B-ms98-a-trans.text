sw3340B-ms98-a-0014 79.664000 83.556375 yes [noise] it may make a difference for some of them_1
sw3340B-ms98-a-0015 83.556375 88.511375 because they don't want to lose that lucrative uh career

sw3340B-ms98-a-0021 98.264500 105.485250 um-hum however here in Dallas uh we had a a player Roy Tarpley on the Mavericks team
sw3340B-ms98-a-0022 105.485250 114.996250 and he had been suspended a couple of times because of drug testing and was to the point he is on probation
sw3340B-ms98-a-0023 114.996250 127.306625 it's to the point that if he was caught another time that he would lose his contract and they wouldn't have to pay him and the Mavericks wanted to get rid of him but they couldn't afford to replace him and still pay his contract
sw3340B-ms98-a-0024 127.306625 130.839000 and i just recently he was uh 
sw3340B-ms98-a-0025 130.839000 145.190375 missing from practice and whenever he missed like that usually he had some kind of problem and so a mandatory drug test was done was positive so they were able to get rid of him and not have to pay his contract
sw3340B-ms98-a-0026 145.190375 154.612125 and so in his case he lost his whole career he's been in the paper in jail and it's just been awful and i talk about a terrible role model

sw3340B-ms98-a-0043 219.247000 231.539750 yes if you know someone for example we have uh some friends whose son was driving home from work was hit head on by a drunk driver the drunk and his wife in the car were killed
sw3340B-ms98-a-0044 231.539750 236.099125 and uh Bobby missed his whole junior year of high school
sw3340B-ms98-a-0045 236.099125 246.349125 he went through surgery after surgery and for a long time they didn't even know whether he'd be normal again and he as far as his ath[letics]- athletics he's lost all of that
sw3340B-ms98-a-0046 246.349125 255.180375 he uh has been tutored and he'll catch up in school and everything but he's still not back where he was he may never have all those motor skills back

sw3340B-ms98-a-0050 265.607875 274.145875 another thing that we saw here recently one of some of our high school kids were out goofing around in a park area that a a train track ran through
sw3340B-ms98-a-0051 274.145875 280.714125 and one boy who had been drinking decided for some stupid reason to try to play with the train
sw3340B-ms98-a-0052 280.714125 287.799875 well he m[issed]- the train missed him but uh a big mirror type thing sticking out like a metal thing sticking out hit him in the head
sw3340B-ms98-a-0053 287.799875 294.328375 he was in a coma for four months he's out of the coma now and eventually they think he will come back
sw3340B-ms98-a-0054 294.328375 298.466000 but you don't know that an[d]- but he's lost he was an outstanding football player
