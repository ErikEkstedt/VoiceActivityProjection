sw3339A-ms98-a-0037 157.953500 160.384125 [silence]
sw3339A-ms98-a-0038 160.384125 162.151375 was it in Dallas

sw3339A-ms98-a-0045 180.006625 185.126250 oh yeah uh-huh i thought it might have been something that the state required but that wouldn't
sw3339A-ms98-a-0046 185.126250 187.979875 that wouldn't apply to that would it
sw3339A-ms98-a-0047 187.979875 191.412750 [silence]
sw3339A-ms98-a-0048 191.412750 193.906000 uh-huh that didn't make sense uh

sw3339A-ms98-a-0051 198.789250 202.942125 well and it those kind it probably didn't pay a whole lot either
sw3339A-ms98-a-0052 202.942125 205.755875 so if it doesn't pay a whole lot it's hard to put up with a lot of
sw3339A-ms98-a-0053 205.755875 206.801125 [noise]
sw3339A-ms98-a-0054 206.801125 212.508750 that Mickey Mouse stuff that's my other line but i no i'll just ignore it wh[ile]-
sw3339A-ms98-a-0055 212.508750 218.601500 yeah i'll just i'll just ignore it and if they want anything they'll [noise] in a little while
sw3339A-ms98-a-0056 218.601500 220.651500 and uh
sw3339A-ms98-a-0057 220.651500 222.521250 [noise] since we go[t]-
sw3339A-ms98-a-0058 222.521250 223.803375 [silence]

sw3339A-ms98-a-0060 226.387750 227.953500 [silence]
sw3339A-ms98-a-0061 227.953500 238.143500 yeah well neither one of them_1 have them_1 in a day care center right now but uh um m[y]- my daughter that [noise] has three sons she is a 
sw3339A-ms98-a-0062 238.143500 240.150500 you still there aren't you
sw3339A-ms98-a-0063 240.150500 253.885500 i guess it was that thing hanging up uh she had him in one and was real happy with it and then got unhappy with it and then she moved him to another one and was just real happy with it it's in Garland
sw3339A-ms98-a-0064 253.885500 258.932750 so uh she had really i'd say she had pretty good experiences with them_1
sw3339A-ms98-a-0065 258.932750 263.132250 oh oh yeah the one she the first one she quit they'd lost his medicine
sw3339A-ms98-a-0066 263.132250 272.691375 sent it home with another kid and it made her mad but i mean that's you know you got fifty kids there i could see that happening
sw3339A-ms98-a-0067 272.691375 276.722750 but you course you lose a fifty dollar bottle of medicine but it looks like s[omebody]-
sw3339A-ms98-a-0068 276.722750 280.589500 well it looks like they would've whoever took it home would've brought it back
sw3339A-ms98-a-0069 280.589500 290.235250 but anyway it made her real mad that's why she left it but other than that i mean it you know they'd been real good too so i'd s[ay]- i'd say she's had really you know real good experiences with them_1 
sw3339A-ms98-a-0070 290.235250 296.308125 nothing no horror stories or you know of course they're regulated pretty strictly by the state
sw3339A-ms98-a-0071 296.308125 298.562000 and uh which is good
