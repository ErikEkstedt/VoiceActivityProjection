sw3390A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 7.236000 [noise] i um think that's one of the greatest concerns that uh is in our nation today is the crime problem
sw3390A-ms98-a-0002 7.236000 9.104000 what do you think
sw3390A-ms98-a-0003 9.104000 13.492875 [silence]
sw3390A-ms98-a-0004 13.492875 15.001500 um-hum
sw3390A-ms98-a-0005 15.001500 24.617000 [silence]
sw3390A-ms98-a-0006 24.617000 26.045375 um-hum
sw3390A-ms98-a-0007 26.045375 31.879125 [silence]
sw3390A-ms98-a-0008 31.879125 36.966750 i know in the large cities uh um we think that we have more crime but
sw3390A-ms98-a-0009 36.966750 46.011250 we have a place out in the country and uh we've had more [vocalized-noise] more people break into our place in the country than we have in town
sw3390A-ms98-a-0010 46.011250 50.297250 and so i don't know that it's confined just to the large cities
sw3390A-ms98-a-0011 50.297250 53.543250 but uh we found that
sw3390A-ms98-a-0012 53.543250 60.940125 the crime rate in the country increased when they had let loose some uh early parolees
sw3390A-ms98-a-0013 60.940125 71.729375 and uh that concerned me because i was hoping letting the people out of prison early on for good behavior would work but i about_1 decided it didn't
sw3390A-ms98-a-0014 71.729375 73.648250 but um
sw3390A-ms98-a-0015 73.648250 80.752875 [silence]
sw3390A-ms98-a-0016 80.752875 85.517375 i think sometimes it it depends on what space they [laughter-need]

sw3390A-ms98-a-0020 89.581250 100.030625 do you think that that has as much to do with the rising crime rate as uh the uh beginning of the of the gangs and things
sw3390A-ms98-a-0021 100.030625 116.350250 [silence]
sw3390A-ms98-a-0022 116.350250 118.011750 oh yes

sw3390A-ms98-a-0034 176.943125 191.370125 well do you think that uh with the recession that everyone says is coming along and more women don't find work and have to stay home and the economy goes down do you think that would help
sw3390A-ms98-a-0035 191.370125 196.202625 um deter the crime raise and and increase raising of families
