sw3390B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.093375 [noise]
sw3390B-ms98-a-0002 1.093375 8.802875 [silence]
sw3390B-ms98-a-0003 8.802875 16.625250 oh yeah well yeah there's a host a lot of things that center around that crime area uh you know from
sw3390B-ms98-a-0004 16.625250 26.403375 from just uh people trying to make a living on the wrong side of the law to those who are just trying to uh keep their drug habit up and uh
sw3390B-ms98-a-0005 26.403375 31.683875 so i think that it encompasses a whole lot of the concerns
sw3390B-ms98-a-0006 31.683875 45.125000 [silence]
sw3390B-ms98-a-0007 45.125000 46.885125 oh really
sw3390B-ms98-a-0008 46.885125 49.740125 [silence]
sw3390B-ms98-a-0009 49.740125 51.041500 uh-huh
sw3390B-ms98-a-0010 51.041500 70.776250 [silence]
sw3390B-ms98-a-0011 70.776250 72.328500 um-hum
sw3390B-ms98-a-0012 72.328500 73.405000 [silence]
sw3390B-ms98-a-0013 73.405000 82.160625 yeah i i just don't know what kind of criteria they have used for most of those early parole [leases/releases] releases so uh
sw3390B-ms98-a-0014 82.160625 84.874375 [silence]
sw3390B-ms98-a-0015 84.874375 87.590375 that's right i think you're right
sw3390B-ms98-a-0016 87.590375 89.918500 i'm sure it has a lot to do with it
sw3390B-ms98-a-0017 89.918500 99.484875 [silence]
sw3390B-ms98-a-0018 99.484875 101.861750 well i think um
sw3390B-ms98-a-0019 101.861750 105.534000 certainly that might have something to do with it but i also think that
sw3390B-ms98-a-0020 105.534000 117.092375 the standards of uh what we consider normal a[re]- is drastically changing each generation at least if not faster by because of the movies that are out there
sw3390B-ms98-a-0021 117.092375 123.368375 and what all the kids are exposed to and also the grown-ups out there that we're just constantly watching and
sw3390B-ms98-a-0022 123.368375 131.148000 what we would of norm[ally]- you know used to consider awful is almost a normal kind of thing on TV now and
sw3390B-ms98-a-0023 131.148000 135.693750 yeah and i so i think that it's uh and also i think uh
sw3390B-ms98-a-0024 135.693750 145.055625 the way our lives our families are are uh being raised that with a lot more single families or a lot more full-time working families that uh
sw3390B-ms98-a-0025 145.055625 154.005500 there are a lot more strangers out there taking care of our kids and i i mean strangers in the sense of not the close family knit types that they used to have
sw3390B-ms98-a-0026 154.005500 165.654375 and um i felt so i think there's a lot more people growing up confused and feeling not really considering uh you know necessarily as wanted or loved as they might have felt
sw3390B-ms98-a-0027 165.654375 169.012750 uh had the family been a little {closer-knit}
sw3390B-ms98-a-0028 169.012750 172.553625 [silence]
sw3390B-ms98-a-0029 172.553625 177.549750 that's that's right that's a good good way to say uh to say it
sw3390B-ms98-a-0030 177.549750 195.493500 [silence]
sw3390B-ms98-a-0031 195.493500 202.788500 [vocalized-noise] well i think it would be a long term change i don't think -[th]at we will see it too soon i think it'll
sw3390B-ms98-a-0032 202.788500 211.369375 not ch[ange]- i don't think it will slow down for quite some time just because there's you know it's gonna take that pendulum a long time to swing back the other way
sw3390B-ms98-a-0033 211.369375 216.945250 [silence]
sw3390B-ms98-a-0034 216.945250 218.597500 that's true
sw3390B-ms98-a-0035 218.597500 224.303500 [silence]
sw3390B-ms98-a-0036 224.303500 226.066000 um-hum
sw3390B-ms98-a-0037 226.066000 236.262750 oh yeah i think there are definitely are ways that both parents can work and have recent you know responsible and and you know very loving children growing up and staying that way
sw3390B-ms98-a-0038 236.262750 248.331125 but i think it takes the effort and extra time and effort out of those parents and not too many not as many people are doing that as they should because_1 we're used to having an easy get it when you want it society and
sw3390B-ms98-a-0039 248.331125 257.853375 uh [laughter-you] [laughter-know] uh the easy way out is considered more appropriate sometimes than than the working hard methods that used to be 
sw3390B-ms98-a-0040 257.853375 259.282500 so
sw3390B-ms98-a-0041 259.282500 266.444625 [silence]
sw3390B-ms98-a-0042 266.444625 274.169250 right i think we're all tired and having too many pressures and i just occurred when you mentioned principal it occurred to me when i was teaching how
sw3390B-ms98-a-0043 274.169250 282.960375 um it was becoming quite disturbing realizing how many crack babies w[ere]- there were becoming you know out there in the educational area and
sw3390B-ms98-a-0044 282.960375 287.397625 and the things that we'll be dealing with just on the educational front that
sw3390B-ms98-a-0045 287.397625 298.562000 um are people that w[ill]- children that will eventually grow to be older possible crime makers themselves because they started out in life with having so many you know uh
