sw3331A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 7.994875 [noise] well what i believe i[s]- one of the major pro[blems]- uh things that is wrong with our public school system is that um we do not have enough
sw3331A-ms98-a-0002 7.994875 15.078875 discipline and the parents do not let the teachers discipline the children the way that they need to be disciplined right now
sw3331A-ms98-a-0003 15.078875 16.112375 [noise]
sw3331A-ms98-a-0004 16.112375 20.638250 uh when i went to school i know i was scared to death
sw3331A-ms98-a-0005 20.638250 29.266500 about being disciplined and the discipline that my daughter receives now in going to school it's just totally different
sw3331A-ms98-a-0006 29.266500 39.475500 you know you just you did not see i did not see anybody in my classrooms when i was going to school act up the way that kids do these days in the classroom
sw3331A-ms98-a-0007 39.475500 41.858500 [silence]
sw3331A-ms98-a-0008 41.858500 46.279750 yeah [noise] that's right that's right
sw3331A-ms98-a-0009 46.279750 56.088125 [noise] my my daughter's in the um fourth grade and um there's children in her classroom that just totally disrupt
sw3331A-ms98-a-0010 56.088125 62.898625 the classroom where the teacher cannot teach and when i went to school that just wasn't put up with
sw3331A-ms98-a-0011 62.898625 65.255250 [silence]
sw3331A-ms98-a-0012 65.255250 74.825500 uh-huh well th[ey]- they they just don't do that anymore th[e]- th[e]- school system's afraid of getting sued and um
sw3331A-ms98-a-0013 74.825500 83.411500 all sorts of lawsuits i'm sure because of things like that and i also believe we don't
sw3331A-ms98-a-0014 83.411500 96.497250 even though i feel like i pay a good share towards the school system that the teachers are still underpaid and we still don't have enough money towards putting toward public schools
sw3331A-ms98-a-0015 96.497250 106.210750 and um i think that if we had enough money and paid the teachers a little bit more that maybe that can solve some of our
sw3331A-ms98-a-0016 106.210750 107.942750 problems
sw3331A-ms98-a-0017 107.942750 110.675750 [silence]

sw3331A-ms98-a-0019 124.923125 126.221125 [noise]
sw3331A-ms98-a-0020 126.221125 132.040875 i think in some ways that they need to be more careful of the teachers that they hire
sw3331A-ms98-a-0021 132.040875 143.779250 i have heard stories um from other parents that i know of when their children are in high school that teachers are out there giving drugs and selling drugs 
sw3331A-ms98-a-0022 143.779250 155.013250 oh yeah oh i've i've heard some horrible horrible stories about high s[chool]- high school teachers and you know to be m[ore]- be more careful of the teachers that we place in our schools
sw3331A-ms98-a-0023 155.013250 167.800125 um that's basically about all that i know that may be wrong with the school systems i think with what they have to work with i think they're doing a pretty good job [laughter-right] [laughter-now]
