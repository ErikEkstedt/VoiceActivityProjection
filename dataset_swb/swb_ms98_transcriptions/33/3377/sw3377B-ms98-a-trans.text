sw3377B-ms98-a-0007 31.847500 35.663125 well i'm one of those rare left handed golfers
sw3377B-ms98-a-0008 35.663125 38.533625 and i do enjoy playing
sw3377B-ms98-a-0009 38.533625 41.498125 [silence]
sw3377B-ms98-a-0010 41.498125 43.874750 right now it's three
sw3377B-ms98-a-0011 43.874750 52.747750 [silence]
sw3377B-ms98-a-0012 52.747750 57.188750 well if you play with some consistency though you can get it right back down
sw3377B-ms98-a-0013 57.188750 69.093875 [silence]
sw3377B-ms98-a-0014 69.093875 74.526750 uh well we can usually play here year round
sw3377B-ms98-a-0015 74.526750 79.201500 sometimes in January it's not too comfortable to play
sw3377B-ms98-a-0016 79.201500 86.281000 but there's usually two or three days in the week that you can get out there and play and i'm pretty much addicted to golf so
sw3377B-ms98-a-0017 86.281000 87.308375 [silence]
sw3377B-ms98-a-0018 87.308375 89.856375 i get out there one way or the other
sw3377B-ms98-a-0019 89.856375 99.791375 [silence]
sw3377B-ms98-a-0020 99.791375 104.981875 it's a good game though it's very challenging and the reason i like it so much is because i'm
sw3377B-ms98-a-0021 104.981875 107.932375 essentially playing against myself
sw3377B-ms98-a-0022 107.932375 114.711250 that's the way i look at it i i play in in lo[t]- a lot of groups and but i do[n't]-
sw3377B-ms98-a-0023 114.711250 117.013750 they keep score and
sw3377B-ms98-a-0024 117.013750 127.651750 between themselves but i really don't care um i go out and each shot i say well this is what i'm gonna try to do and then i see how close i can come to that
sw3377B-ms98-a-0025 127.651750 130.903875 [silence]
sw3377B-ms98-a-0026 130.903875 144.401375 yeah and i[nevitably]- inevitably one fa[cet]- facet of my game isn't working at one time or another either i'm not driving very well or i'm not hitting long irons very well or i'm not putting well or
sw3377B-ms98-a-0027 144.401375 147.421875 but sometimes it all comes together
sw3377B-ms98-a-0028 147.421875 161.252625 [silence]
sw3377B-ms98-a-0029 161.252625 165.334500 well we just had the tour championship here in Pine Hurst

sw3377B-ms98-a-0035 177.931000 186.203000 i'd say we probably have [noise] within fifteen miles twenty golf communities built around courses that are
sw3377B-ms98-a-0036 186.203000 190.086875 pretty well designed and then of course Pine Hurst and
sw3377B-ms98-a-0037 190.086875 193.790500 we still have the Greensboro Open here every year
sw3377B-ms98-a-0038 193.790500 197.751875 [silence]
sw3377B-ms98-a-0039 197.751875 207.666500 yes we do as a matter of fact it it uh it's only been that way in the last five years but now you uh most of the courses have a uh
