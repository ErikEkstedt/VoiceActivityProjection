sw3334B-ms98-a-0003 3.594625 5.838875 [noise] well [noise]
sw3334B-ms98-a-0004 5.838875 9.510875 i think they're kind of ambivalent really uh
sw3334B-ms98-a-0005 9.510875 16.892625 i- i just have a feeling that we've kind of talked out of both sides of mouths down there like we do in some other situations you know
sw3334B-ms98-a-0006 16.892625 20.903125 we're we don't know half the time we don't know who to support
sw3334B-ms98-a-0007 20.903125 26.761000 [silence]
sw3334B-ms98-a-0008 26.761000 34.420750 that and you know uh maybe it's maybe it's tough for a big powerful nation to deal with with uh
sw3334B-ms98-a-0009 34.420750 41.782875 countries like that that depend on us so much without you know just telling them_1 running their country for them_1 but
sw3334B-ms98-a-0010 41.782875 51.129375 it's got to be tough but i mean uh uh i'm you sure you still have to you know let them_1 know how you feel [noise]
sw3334B-ms98-a-0011 51.129375 76.668000 [silence]
sw3334B-ms98-a-0012 76.668000 84.047000 yeah it it worries me that uh the economy of so many countries in in South America and Central America
sw3334B-ms98-a-0013 84.047000 90.300375 depend on something that that damages people like the you know like cocaine from Columbia and
sw3334B-ms98-a-0014 90.300375 92.346625 uh [noise]
sw3334B-ms98-a-0015 92.346625 98.443000 you know of course i i'm sure we have some enemies down there who would wouldn't care what happened to us but
sw3334B-ms98-a-0016 98.443000 112.042000 but that is that's a tough deal [noise] and it i don't think that maybe i'm maybe it's you know i'm just reflecting how i feel about it but i have a feeling that we that we really don't understand basically the the 
sw3334B-ms98-a-0017 112.042000 119.795500 the competing factions in [laughter-a] [laughter-lot] of those countries and i mean they've been hammering tongs for the last you know ten centuries
sw3334B-ms98-a-0018 119.795500 122.512000 and it's still going on and uh
sw3334B-ms98-a-0019 122.512000 128.632875 we we dabble in it just enough to make both sides angry at us i think sometimes
sw3334B-ms98-a-0020 128.632875 140.127500 [silence]
sw3334B-ms98-a-0021 140.127500 141.744875 yeah

sw3334B-ms98-a-0026 164.991500 171.722250 well i'm blank [laughter] i can see his face i mean how could you forget his face [laughter]
sw3334B-ms98-a-0027 171.722250 176.870125 [silence]
sw3334B-ms98-a-0028 176.870125 179.364000 yeah kind of nationalized it
sw3334B-ms98-a-0029 179.364000 180.742625 for himself
sw3334B-ms98-a-0030 180.742625 182.403250 [silence]
sw3334B-ms98-a-0031 182.403250 185.009250 [noise]

sw3334B-ms98-a-0035 199.474625 202.152750 dictator yeah
sw3334B-ms98-a-0036 202.152750 207.678250 and it seems like those countries are so easily susceptible to that kind of thing it just
sw3334B-ms98-a-0037 207.678250 209.911625 you know unstable
sw3334B-ms98-a-0038 209.911625 215.462875 [silence]
sw3334B-ms98-a-0039 215.462875 229.370000 well i think it's long overdue uh i just you know there's so much difference in in the economies of the two countries i i'm not you know i have a problem uh
sw3334B-ms98-a-0040 229.370000 230.490500 [silence]
sw3334B-ms98-a-0041 230.490500 233.746125 with whether it's gonna work or not you know
sw3334B-ms98-a-0042 233.746125 236.053375 there's uh
sw3334B-ms98-a-0043 236.053375 238.180500 it seems like there's
sw3334B-ms98-a-0044 238.180500 243.432625 and i this may be unfair to Mexico but it seems like there's a lack of honesty in [noise] in
sw3334B-ms98-a-0045 243.432625 246.916875 in in foreign policy a lot of the times
sw3334B-ms98-a-0046 246.916875 263.511500 [silence]
sw3334B-ms98-a-0047 263.511500 264.915375 yeah

sw3334B-ms98-a-0051 291.178750 296.590000 i think there's their version of the good old boy network going [vocalized-noise] that uh
sw3334B-ms98-a-0052 296.590000 298.018000 you know has a lot
