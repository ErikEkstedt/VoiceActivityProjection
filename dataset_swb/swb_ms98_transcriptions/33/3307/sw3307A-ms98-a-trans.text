sw3307A-ms98-a-0028 103.230625 108.837375 one of the things that we've done towards that is um buy nursing home insurance
sw3307A-ms98-a-0029 108.837375 110.781750 have you all thought of that

sw3307A-ms98-a-0041 142.122875 148.160375 [noise] well the uh if you have the retirement fund at place like that they're usually fairly good

sw3307A-ms98-a-0043 152.773875 157.682000 has ended uh the plan has ended three different times this year [laughter]
sw3307A-ms98-a-0044 157.682000 159.920875 [laughter-so]
sw3307A-ms98-a-0045 159.920875 168.425375 uh no because uh of the changes that came about in the government requirements and then in uh in merger requirements
sw3307A-ms98-a-0046 168.425375 177.315000 [noise] but um my husband was looking into the nursing home insurance is it's it's really is an investment you hope you never have you use
sw3307A-ms98-a-0047 177.315000 181.942375 but uh you have to be so careful of what it will pay and what it won't pay
sw3307A-ms98-a-0048 181.942375 189.271625 [silence]
sw3307A-ms98-a-0049 189.271625 192.139375 oh no no it's an insurance policy

sw3307A-ms98-a-0051 193.230750 194.983250 [silence]
sw3307A-ms98-a-0052 194.983250 197.901125 it pays a set amount
sw3307A-ms98-a-0053 197.901125 199.135750 and uh
sw3307A-ms98-a-0054 199.135750 204.497250 and you talk to your insurance agent about there's special companies now that are doing it
sw3307A-ms98-a-0055 204.497250 212.549375 and they set them_1 up i know ours is a set amount each year and it has a maximum amount over a thirty month period
sw3307A-ms98-a-0056 212.549375 218.067750 and uh it you know it has you need to read the policy and look into what it covers
sw3307A-ms98-a-0057 218.067750 222.091000 i guess i'm conscious of that because_1 my mother's in a nursing home
sw3307A-ms98-a-0058 222.091000 226.343500 and uh i think we we learn from our experiences
sw3307A-ms98-a-0059 226.343500 230.824625 [silence]

sw3307A-ms98-a-0063 234.122875 243.728125 i think one of the main things that we in the past always talked about was not having any major expenses to budget for when we do retire
sw3307A-ms98-a-0064 243.728125 251.288125 [silence]

sw3307A-ms98-a-0076 279.199875 287.412125 you know you can't then the insurance policies are just things to kind of buffer in case of unexpected things
sw3307A-ms98-a-0077 287.412125 289.967000 [silence]
sw3307A-ms98-a-0078 289.967000 291.815375 oh yes but uh
