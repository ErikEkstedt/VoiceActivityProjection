sw3342A-ms98-a-0025 95.572625 96.742375 [silence]
sw3342A-ms98-a-0026 96.742375 98.617875 do you have a boat
sw3342A-ms98-a-0027 98.617875 102.406750 [silence]

sw3342A-ms98-a-0030 106.835875 115.165875 i think the lakes are probably different in Michigan than they are in Texas the ones around here are so big that you can fish off the dock
sw3342A-ms98-a-0031 115.165875 120.935625 but unless you have a boat you can't really get into the where they call the good fishing holes you know
sw3342A-ms98-a-0032 120.935625 122.197125 [silence]
sw3342A-ms98-a-0033 122.197125 123.690125 is it

sw3342A-ms98-a-0035 124.751750 136.690125 uh-huh my in-laws live on a lake uh a little bit east of Dallas kind of in the Piney Woods and the lake is beautiful and i like to go out and stand at the end of the dock and fish but
sw3342A-ms98-a-0036 136.690125 144.808375 actually catching fish to eat per se you don't really do much of that right there i catch a lot of little old uh i think they call them_1 perch
sw3342A-ms98-a-0037 144.808375 155.438250 and then the the uh turtles try to eat up all my bait [laughter] so it's it's so close to the dock that i think all i do is feed them_1 a little [laughter-bit] but it's kind of fun
sw3342A-ms98-a-0038 155.438250 161.334250 [silence]
sw3342A-ms98-a-0039 161.334250 162.942125 um
sw3342A-ms98-a-0040 162.942125 165.227375 i would be afraid of that
sw3342A-ms98-a-0041 165.227375 168.363000 [silence]
sw3342A-ms98-a-0042 168.363000 170.927625 [noise] do they ever get on your hook

sw3342A-ms98-a-0051 193.557250 198.172750 yeah i think i'd be a little bit afraid of those
sw3342A-ms98-a-0052 198.172750 200.345750 [silence]
sw3342A-ms98-a-0053 200.345750 201.913250 um-hum
sw3342A-ms98-a-0054 201.913250 208.675750 we uh saw a large snake right off the dock there at my in-laws place last year [noise]
sw3342A-ms98-a-0055 208.675750 220.939875 it was probably four inches in diameter or some[thing]- something like that you know great big snake and it course it scared the women to death you know but the men come out and said oh well that's only a a king snake it won't really hurt you you know
sw3342A-ms98-a-0056 220.939875 231.943125 but it looked so bad and it was so big that it it might not would have hurt us but we sure felt like it was hurting us just being there [laughter-you] [laughter-know] but they're scary looking
sw3342A-ms98-a-0057 231.943125 240.092625 [noise] yes uh i think that uh probably around here people fish for bass and crappie and catfish more than anything else
sw3342A-ms98-a-0058 240.092625 241.321125 [silence]
sw3342A-ms98-a-0059 241.321125 245.260125 um-hum now they have a lot of bass tournaments
sw3342A-ms98-a-0060 245.260125 246.630000 [silence]
sw3342A-ms98-a-0061 246.630000 248.046500 um-hum

sw3342A-ms98-a-0064 252.957625 254.818250 [silence]
sw3342A-ms98-a-0065 254.818250 269.270125 um-hum well that's kind of we've never entered a tournament or anything we're not that big into fishing but i see a lot of people you know early in the morning there'll be all the boats going out and they'll say well there's a big bass tournament this weekend and all those people are here for the tournament you know
sw3342A-ms98-a-0066 269.270125 277.857750 so i think there's a lot of people that have you know really i guess that you'd call it really sport fishing they're really into it to try to win
sw3342A-ms98-a-0067 277.857750 278.923000 [silence]
sw3342A-ms98-a-0068 278.923000 280.633125 my [noise]
sw3342A-ms98-a-0069 280.633125 290.504750 but it is it's very a very relaxing sport to be able to just be out in on the water and looking around the peace and calmness is really relaxing
sw3342A-ms98-a-0070 290.504750 293.157000 [silence]
