sw3375B-ms98-a-0003 11.529250 22.984625 uh that might be a lot to do with it i know a lot of it here in my state i'm from Mississippi i'm not sure where you're from Minnesota okay well a lot of it in Mississippi here is got to do with funding
sw3375B-ms98-a-0004 22.984625 32.793000 problems with our education system a lot of it's due money and they're trying to spend money where we don't have it and there's a lot of things we need that we just can't afford

sw3375B-ms98-a-0006 37.778875 39.343750 well it is

sw3375B-ms98-a-0010 46.996500 59.770125 that's true and a lot of it lot of it has to do with uh salaries too speaking of money because_1 if you can't pay the right people you know they're not going to be able to do they're not not gonna get the people that can do a good job
sw3375B-ms98-a-0011 59.770125 73.195250 [silence]
sw3375B-ms98-a-0012 73.195250 75.526625 right i feel the s[ame]-
sw3375B-ms98-a-0013 75.526625 80.178625 right i feel the same way a lot's got to do with how the kids were raised at home
sw3375B-ms98-a-0014 80.178625 89.527500 and then when the kids get to school they try to take away a lot of things that they can do to discipline the kids i mean they've so se[verely]- se[verely]- severely limited
sw3375B-ms98-a-0015 89.527500 92.146750 what disciplinary action you can do
sw3375B-ms98-a-0016 92.146750 100.934875 [silence]
sw3375B-ms98-a-0017 100.934875 103.662375 exactly right
sw3375B-ms98-a-0018 103.662375 105.430000 [silence]
sw3375B-ms98-a-0019 105.430000 109.507500 lose their job an[d]- an[d]- big lawsuit and all that
sw3375B-ms98-a-0020 109.507500 114.846625 i feel that's got a lot to do with it people aren't as afraid of misbehaving as they used to be
sw3375B-ms98-a-0021 114.846625 123.808000 [silence]
sw3375B-ms98-a-0022 123.808000 135.373625 [laughter-really] we've we've talked some about it in my state because we've have a lot of uh prob[lems]- well our governor that just got thrown out of office was trying to be real big on education but he wasn't
sw3375B-ms98-a-0023 135.373625 144.488500 and a lot of his problems had to do with money mostly i know a lot o[f]- a lot of if you have more money it's just logical that you can provide a better school system 
sw3375B-ms98-a-0024 144.488500 148.345000 and unfortunately there's not many places to get that money
sw3375B-ms98-a-0025 148.345000 149.624500 [silence]
sw3375B-ms98-a-0026 149.624500 152.048500 then if you don't have
sw3375B-ms98-a-0027 152.048500 160.838500 qualified teachers in the different subject areas i know one of my physics professors at college has -[ha]s addressed this that
sw3375B-ms98-a-0028 160.838500 170.550125 most of the teachers at the um elementary and high school level aren't scientists they're teachers and they may not know a lot about what they're teaching
sw3375B-ms98-a-0029 170.550125 174.300125 where as they may have just had a teaching major
sw3375B-ms98-a-0030 174.300125 181.552750 and then had some social studies courses and they're trying to teach social studies and they don't know a lot about that
sw3375B-ms98-a-0031 181.552750 191.472375 where maybe a physics professor he my professor was a physics professor and he said a lot of teachers teaching physics today have no background in physics at the high school level
sw3375B-ms98-a-0032 191.472375 197.600375 so therefore they're teaching from a teacher's point of view and not from a physicist point of view and that causes a lot of trouble
sw3375B-ms98-a-0033 197.600375 214.600625 [silence]
sw3375B-ms98-a-0034 214.600625 216.019000 right
sw3375B-ms98-a-0035 216.019000 227.192500 [silence]
sw3375B-ms98-a-0036 227.192500 232.633750 exactly because i mean here in uh the county where i went to high school
sw3375B-ms98-a-0037 232.633750 238.075000 one of the th[e]- the four high schools in my county one of the high schools was blown away by a tornado
sw3375B-ms98-a-0038 238.075000 250.000000 so when they rebuilt that school they had a a top of the line high tech school there and the other schools were built back in maybe the fifties or early sixties
sw3375B-ms98-a-0039 250.000000 260.989375 and then when uh evaluation committees came through they praised the school that had been rebuilt while they were down grading all these other ones telling them_1 what they need to do to fix up this building and this and this and this
sw3375B-ms98-a-0040 260.989375 267.740625 and so i[t]- it kind of would make you think that we'd all be better off if all the schools were blown away by tornadoes and we had to rebuild them
