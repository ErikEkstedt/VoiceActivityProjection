sw3381B-ms98-a-0007 32.865625 34.678750 [silence]
sw3381B-ms98-a-0008 34.678750 36.288625 yeah
sw3381B-ms98-a-0009 36.288625 39.980500 yeah that was really on the national news a lot
sw3381B-ms98-a-0010 39.980500 42.868250 we heard a lot about that in Texas
sw3381B-ms98-a-0011 42.868250 44.519875 [silence]
sw3381B-ms98-a-0012 44.519875 45.532500 [noise]
sw3381B-ms98-a-0013 45.532500 61.624250 [silence]
sw3381B-ms98-a-0014 61.624250 63.071500 oh
sw3381B-ms98-a-0015 63.071500 66.698500 [silence]
sw3381B-ms98-a-0016 66.698500 70.180500 well i can imagine it seems like the
sw3381B-ms98-a-0017 70.180500 75.254625 violent crimes are increasing a lot to me i- i don't know
sw3381B-ms98-a-0018 75.254625 81.973875 i don't know if statistically they are but it seems like you sure hear a maybe you just hear a lot more about them_1 on the news i don't know
sw3381B-ms98-a-0019 81.973875 88.732250 [silence]
sw3381B-ms98-a-0020 88.732250 91.490875 you wonder about that sometimes
sw3381B-ms98-a-0021 91.490875 95.109125 [silence]
sw3381B-ms98-a-0022 95.109125 103.088875 um-hum that's kind of scary i'd i'm [noise] wish there was some way that we could change the news media so they didn't feature these
sw3381B-ms98-a-0023 103.088875 107.931250 way out stories maybe it wouldn't give other people ideas
sw3381B-ms98-a-0024 107.931250 112.873875 [silence]
sw3381B-ms98-a-0025 112.873875 116.663875 yes we do do you have it up there
sw3381B-ms98-a-0026 116.663875 118.375875 i see
sw3381B-ms98-a-0027 118.375875 121.042500 do you think that's a deterrent
sw3381B-ms98-a-0028 121.042500 130.361000 [silence]
sw3381B-ms98-a-0029 130.361000 131.238000 yeah
sw3381B-ms98-a-0030 131.238000 133.763875 [silence]
sw3381B-ms98-a-0031 133.763875 134.870750 um-hum
sw3381B-ms98-a-0032 134.870750 143.264375 i guess that's another thing that to me is a a real problem and i know we've got so many people in our prison system now at least here in Texas
sw3381B-ms98-a-0033 143.264375 147.146250 i mean they're really in a crisis there's been times they've had to
sw3381B-ms98-a-0034 147.146250 155.707750 just close off the prisons and leave them_1 in county jails or whatever because_1 there just wasn't enough room for all of them_1 and
sw3381B-ms98-a-0035 155.707750 160.427625 a lot of them_1 they put out on parole and then some of the ones that they put out early
sw3381B-ms98-a-0036 160.427625 166.487625 you know do repeat offenses and the crime rate's the worst than ever before
sw3381B-ms98-a-0037 166.487625 187.001625 [silence]
sw3381B-ms98-a-0038 187.001625 189.344250 i think that could be true too
sw3381B-ms98-a-0039 189.344250 194.250375 [silence]
sw3381B-ms98-a-0040 194.250375 199.161875 i think the whole parole thing you know if somebody's convicted of
sw3381B-ms98-a-0041 199.161875 203.292750 second degree murder or something gets fifteen years well they're out in
sw3381B-ms98-a-0042 203.292750 207.387625 six or seven you know outbound on the streets again [laughter]
sw3381B-ms98-a-0043 207.387625 214.280125 and to me that's really scary s[ome]- some of these crimes that they commit you know seems like the punishment's not
sw3381B-ms98-a-0044 214.280125 217.310625 really equal to the crime
sw3381B-ms98-a-0045 217.310625 237.127875 [silence]
sw3381B-ms98-a-0046 237.127875 238.988375 oh yeah
sw3381B-ms98-a-0047 238.988375 245.052250 [silence]
sw3381B-ms98-a-0048 245.052250 246.444250 um-hum
sw3381B-ms98-a-0049 246.444250 253.626000 [silence]
sw3381B-ms98-a-0050 253.626000 255.070875 um-hum
sw3381B-ms98-a-0051 255.070875 257.187250 i think it's okay thing to do
sw3381B-ms98-a-0052 257.187250 258.197875 [silence]
sw3381B-ms98-a-0053 258.197875 265.522375 yeah i think that's a very good point you know i there's a lot more working mothers a lot more kids in day care centers
sw3381B-ms98-a-0054 265.522375 272.292000 all that kind of thing morality is being taught more by the schools a lot of times than in the home anymore
sw3381B-ms98-a-0055 272.292000 274.065500 and
sw3381B-ms98-a-0056 274.065500 282.411625 [silence]
