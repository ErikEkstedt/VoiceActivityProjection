sw3362B-ms98-a-0020 76.276125 80.177750 but i still take care of the yeah flower beds and things like that
sw3362B-ms98-a-0021 80.177750 90.193250 i was even planning to go out and to uh dig up some hibiscus plants that will not make it through the winter here but you know were planted in the ground since last spring
sw3362B-ms98-a-0022 90.193250 97.359125 and i was going to dig them up for a friend and for some starters for me and lo and behold about
sw3362B-ms98-a-0023 97.359125 101.796625 five days ago we had a freeze down to about
sw3362B-ms98-a-0024 101.796625 105.531875 oh twenty three degrees or something
sw3362B-ms98-a-0025 105.531875 119.943375 so the hi[biscus]- hibiscus plants no longer [laughter-exist] and i really feel bad about it it's a plant that we've had for probably twenty five years that these were cuttings off of you know
