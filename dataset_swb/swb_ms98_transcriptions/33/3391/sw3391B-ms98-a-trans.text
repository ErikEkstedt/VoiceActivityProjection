sw3391B-ms98-a-0041 160.024000 169.172625 uh oh it's kind of like My Left Foot if you had a chance to see that it's very much like that you know it focuses on an individual who has
sw3391B-ms98-a-0042 169.172625 173.718375 well in in her case she's very very shy
sw3391B-ms98-a-0043 173.718375 185.540750 um and that's not a physical disability but it's certainly a social emotional disability in her case and it it's really beautiful you know because_1 it shows how she blossoms and and about_1 her her her development
sw3391B-ms98-a-0044 185.540750 191.846875 [noise] uh-huh um another one that i really liked was called Truly Madly Deeply
sw3391B-ms98-a-0045 191.846875 202.006625 i believe it's a British film as well and it came well there there are a couple the[y]- they tend to you know show up in San Francisco [laughter-so]
sw3391B-ms98-a-0046 202.006625 213.914625 [laughter] there are a couple theaters that usually show good ones you can count on them to show foreign films that you you feel like you might enjoy as opposed to some that are so eclectic that you can't really relate to them
sw3391B-ms98-a-0047 213.914625 225.526000 and um Truly Madly Deeply is a love story about a person's let's see it's her husband that dies it came out shortly after Ghost
sw3391B-ms98-a-0048 225.526000 237.514625 so um i- i kind of i ki[nd]- related to it a little bit because it it was about her husband's love and her love being so strong that he was able to sort of
sw3391B-ms98-a-0049 237.514625 248.933875 converse with her after he died in such a way to kind of help her make the separation from his death because_1 she was having really hard time grieving for like a year or so after his death and
sw3391B-ms98-a-0050 248.933875 251.531500 Truly Madly Deeply
sw3391B-ms98-a-0051 251.531500 261.424000 uh-huh that's how th[ey]- they used to have a a a game about how much they loved each other they'd loved each other truly no truly madly no truly madly deeply [laughter]
sw3391B-ms98-a-0052 261.424000 267.498750 yeah it's a sweet film it's actually kind of a a spoof on life after death because
sw3391B-ms98-a-0053 267.498750 277.599375 he not only comes back to visit her and help her make the transition after his death but he brings all of his his friends and a lot of them_1 are you know playing cards in her house and
