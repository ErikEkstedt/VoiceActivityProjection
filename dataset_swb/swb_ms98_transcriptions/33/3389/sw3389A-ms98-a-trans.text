sw3389A-ms98-a-0029 112.758750 124.522000 it's pretty much going between Washington they're undefeated and uh Buffalo New Orleans and Chicago because_1 Chicago's only lost twice and one of those was to Buffalo
sw3389A-ms98-a-0030 124.522000 128.500375 and they beat the Saints their only time they lost
sw3389A-ms98-a-0031 128.500375 130.903625 [silence]

sw3389A-ms98-a-0033 134.766625 143.070625 yeah uh from what i saw they were playing when i was at the game we sat right on the front row right behind the Houston Oilers
sw3389A-ms98-a-0034 143.070625 155.841125 and from what i saw the game Houston l[ooked]- Houston impressed me a lot but my brother watched it on TV and said that Warren Moon was just having an off night and if that was an off night i'd hate to see what his uh good night

sw3389A-ms98-a-0038 172.802750 175.148375 that's right who who did they play
sw3389A-ms98-a-0039 175.148375 177.537750 Dallas that's right i w[as]- because_1

sw3389A-ms98-a-0045 192.660875 195.093500 [silence]
sw3389A-ms98-a-0046 195.093500 197.152875 well that's true
sw3389A-ms98-a-0047 197.152875 204.785500 [laughter] that's what i hate to say it but i hate Dallas [laughter] i do
sw3389A-ms98-a-0048 204.785500 208.792750 [silence]
sw3389A-ms98-a-0049 208.792750 210.104625 yeah
sw3389A-ms98-a-0050 210.104625 212.156375 [silence]
sw3389A-ms98-a-0051 212.156375 219.230500 yeah i imagine that's the way i've never been a big Saints fan until the last year or two and they've they've actually started doing something
sw3389A-ms98-a-0052 219.230500 222.021125 so i've actually pai[d]- paid attention to them_1
sw3389A-ms98-a-0053 222.021125 223.498875 [silence]
sw3389A-ms98-a-0054 223.498875 225.012375 um
sw3389A-ms98-a-0055 225.012375 229.875000 well do you know anything about the expansion teams they're thinking about bringing in
sw3389A-ms98-a-0056 229.875000 233.304250 [silence]
sw3389A-ms98-a-0057 233.304250 234.537750 really
sw3389A-ms98-a-0058 234.537750 236.761875 [silence]
sw3389A-ms98-a-0059 236.761875 246.181500 uh right now i think this Memphis they're they're trying to get a team and that's that's where i was when i saw uh Houston play
sw3389A-ms98-a-0060 246.181500 257.342875 Saint Louis is trying to get a team uh Baltimore is trying to get a team and there's some other city i'm wanting to say Raleigh Durham but i'm not sure
sw3389A-ms98-a-0061 257.342875 259.217875 [silence]
sw3389A-ms98-a-0062 259.217875 260.953375 think so
sw3389A-ms98-a-0063 260.953375 266.738625 um-hum because_1 i i know they've got a world league football team but i think it might be them
sw3389A-ms98-a-0064 266.738625 269.636250 [silence]
sw3389A-ms98-a-0065 269.636250 276.579750 i would definitely i think they're supposed to put two in by either next year or the year after
sw3389A-ms98-a-0066 276.579750 279.998750 and right now i think Memphis and
sw3389A-ms98-a-0067 279.998750 284.613875 it's Memphis and i think Baltimore have a really good shot at it
sw3389A-ms98-a-0068 284.613875 293.874500 because i know [vocalized-noise] Saint Louis is much bigger than Memphis and when i went up there they were saying that Memphis sold more tickets than Saint Louis did
sw3389A-ms98-a-0069 293.874500 298.626000 yeah it's like the Liberty Bowl or Liberty Stadium in Memphis holds about sixty two
