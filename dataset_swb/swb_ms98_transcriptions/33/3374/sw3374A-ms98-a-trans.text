sw3374A-ms98-a-0005 13.992625 21.382250 [silence]
sw3374A-ms98-a-0006 21.382250 23.691500 that's very important
sw3374A-ms98-a-0007 23.691500 31.376875 i tell you i have uh faced this whole subject myself because my mother is not quite that old but
sw3374A-ms98-a-0008 31.376875 34.966625 she uh has Parkinson's and uh
sw3374A-ms98-a-0009 34.966625 41.471875 we tried taking care of her in the house and it got to where it wasn't safe and then uh
sw3374A-ms98-a-0010 41.471875 47.342000 we had to to uh try different things and finally she's in a nursing home
sw3374A-ms98-a-0011 47.342000 50.158250 [silence]
sw3374A-ms98-a-0012 50.158250 52.764750 um i hope so
sw3374A-ms98-a-0013 52.764750 55.331625 because it really is a bad disease
sw3374A-ms98-a-0014 55.331625 59.494750 [silence]
sw3374A-ms98-a-0015 59.494750 60.786000 um-hum
sw3374A-ms98-a-0016 60.786000 64.704250 [silence]
sw3374A-ms98-a-0017 64.704250 70.841375 well they know what causes it uh you know it's a an insufficiency in the brain 
sw3374A-ms98-a-0018 70.841375 72.198125 [silence]
sw3374A-ms98-a-0019 72.198125 74.642000 yeah but uh
sw3374A-ms98-a-0020 74.642000 80.750250 so far they haven't uh that i know of they haven't figured out why there's a deficiency and
sw3374A-ms98-a-0021 80.750250 85.764875 the medicine they give them is supposed to replace it but it it doesn't
sw3374A-ms98-a-0022 85.764875 87.960125 it also has side affects
sw3374A-ms98-a-0023 87.960125 92.524750 how do you feel about having to place someone in a nursing home
sw3374A-ms98-a-0024 92.524750 97.048750 [silence]
sw3374A-ms98-a-0025 97.048750 98.263375 um-hum
sw3374A-ms98-a-0026 98.263375 105.842625 [silence]
sw3374A-ms98-a-0027 105.842625 107.517000 hm well well
sw3374A-ms98-a-0028 107.517000 112.604875 i think another part of it it depends on whether you are uh physically able to do it
sw3374A-ms98-a-0029 112.604875 114.670500 to give them the care they need
sw3374A-ms98-a-0030 114.670500 117.424375 [silence]
sw3374A-ms98-a-0031 117.424375 122.446375 well and then too uh i found that even if i didn't work
sw3374A-ms98-a-0032 122.446375 127.042125 i couldn't hold up to taking care of mother twenty four hours a day
sw3374A-ms98-a-0033 127.042125 128.221375 because
sw3374A-ms98-a-0034 128.221375 129.744625 it just uh
sw3374A-ms98-a-0035 129.744625 134.328125 uh you know she couldn't do anything by herself and uh
sw3374A-ms98-a-0036 134.328125 137.493875 her mind wonders and she wonders [laughter]
sw3374A-ms98-a-0037 137.493875 141.354375 and uh i've tried it on weekends and stuff and
sw3374A-ms98-a-0038 141.354375 141.881875 i
sw3374A-ms98-a-0039 141.881875 143.790000 my feeling on it
sw3374A-ms98-a-0040 143.790000 147.986500 is that the nursing home is there if you need it
sw3374A-ms98-a-0041 147.986500 149.979875 but you hope you don't need it
sw3374A-ms98-a-0042 149.979875 153.710250 and i think your health is impor[tant]- as important as theirs
sw3374A-ms98-a-0043 153.710250 154.711375 [silence]
sw3374A-ms98-a-0044 154.711375 163.439750 um have you ever thought about what uh kind of things you would look for in a nursing home if you ever had to choose

sw3374A-ms98-a-0073 228.781000 233.787000 well i think the wor[st]- worst thing about having to do it is the guilt you do feel
sw3374A-ms98-a-0074 233.787000 239.271500 and i think the first thing is you have to be absolutely sure that's what you need to do
sw3374A-ms98-a-0075 239.271500 241.079750 and uh
sw3374A-ms98-a-0076 241.079750 242.679750 i know
sw3374A-ms98-a-0077 242.679750 249.053250 i[n]- in my situation we had to consider nursing care and uh
sw3374A-ms98-a-0078 249.053250 257.692750 the doctor available and the fact that it's clean and you also have to you have to uh pay attention to how much it costs too
sw3374A-ms98-a-0079 257.692750 259.615375 [silence]
sw3374A-ms98-a-0080 259.615375 264.304625 um-hum it it can and it costs more than most people make in a year
sw3374A-ms98-a-0081 264.304625 265.688750 but uh
sw3374A-ms98-a-0082 265.688750 266.718875 [silence]
sw3374A-ms98-a-0083 266.718875 270.031875 there is a special insurance you can buy
sw3374A-ms98-a-0084 270.031875 273.492125 for nursing home insurance in fact my husband and i take it
sw3374A-ms98-a-0085 273.492125 274.227875 [laughter]
sw3374A-ms98-a-0086 274.227875 276.579125 becau[se]- we hope we never have to use it
sw3374A-ms98-a-0087 276.579125 279.464500 but uh it would uh
sw3374A-ms98-a-0088 279.464500 286.616000 take care of an interim period until you know if it was a long-term care until Medicaid would kick in
