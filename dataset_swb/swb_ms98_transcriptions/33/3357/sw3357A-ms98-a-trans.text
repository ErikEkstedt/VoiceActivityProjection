sw3357A-ms98-a-0021 117.678875 125.667250 and all he did was he hired someone once to build it and then he watched him and [noise] and he uh built it himself and he did
sw3357A-ms98-a-0022 125.667250 129.825750 yeah it's kind of a a a closet cabinet um
sw3357A-ms98-a-0023 129.825750 142.713875 built on a whole wall took up the whole wall and it's got uh the for hanging up shirts and pants area and drawers and all sorts of things in there it's pretty pretty yeah pretty fancy

sw3357A-ms98-a-0026 168.923500 180.947000 i[t]- it makes it so easy that i think almost anyo[ne]- one could do it if they could afford the probably four or five thousand dollars for each [laughter-item] they got uh it just about everything it does um
sw3357A-ms98-a-0027 180.947000 188.453000 you know different things for for different cuts and that and uh i think it would make it so much easier but
sw3357A-ms98-a-0028 188.453000 195.905625 i think that'd be more for the professional if you're gonna do it as a business uh those types of tools are fine
