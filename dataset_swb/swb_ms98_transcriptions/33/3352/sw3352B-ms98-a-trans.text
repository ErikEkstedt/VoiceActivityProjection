sw3352B-ms98-a-0004 20.381750 26.938750 well actually i've done both kinds uh i'm originally from the state of Virginia
sw3352B-ms98-a-0005 26.938750 34.461000 and uh lived uh near Virginia Beach where we could uh surf cast and uh catch a lot of things in the ocean there
sw3352B-ms98-a-0006 34.461000 36.055125 [silence]
sw3352B-ms98-a-0007 36.055125 38.952125 i don't believe i have fished the James River [vocalized-noise]
sw3352B-ms98-a-0008 38.952125 50.464875 there's a possibility but that was so long [laughter-ago] i moved here to to State College uh in nineteen fifty five and that has pretty well limited my fishing to fresh water
sw3352B-ms98-a-0009 50.464875 61.831500 and we have a lot of uh beautiful fresh water streams that come through this this area i'm in an area called Center County which is in the very center of the state of Pennsylvania
sw3352B-ms98-a-0010 61.831500 64.545125 [silence]
sw3352B-ms98-a-0011 64.545125 73.539125 the trout fishing is really uh beautiful as i say the the streams are oh eight ten fifteen feet wide and so forth and uh
sw3352B-ms98-a-0012 73.539125 83.761750 you you stand on the edge and you you cast out and you you work uh from your feet most of the time and then there are there are a few lakes of course close by
sw3352B-ms98-a-0013 83.761750 86.690375 [silence]
sw3352B-ms98-a-0014 86.690375 101.201625 well to tell you the truth i'm i'm not uh not picky i wherever the area whatever the fish is the specialist in that area i uh i enjoy fishing for it and i try to i haven't fished in several years i'll have to admit
sw3352B-ms98-a-0015 101.201625 106.516000 but when i do fish i do contact uh some of the local specialists
sw3352B-ms98-a-0016 106.516000 115.739500 so that i can then find out the uh the type of lures that they use and where they fish and any unique uh techniques that would help you
sw3352B-ms98-a-0017 115.739500 118.621875 [silence]
sw3352B-ms98-a-0018 118.621875 122.189500 uh no we f[ly]- we fly fish um-hum

sw3352B-ms98-a-0027 156.753000 162.481625 so that well they they they uh they have a pretty good idea of of uh
sw3352B-ms98-a-0028 162.481625 166.074625 w[hat]- what the number of fish are in these various locations and
sw3352B-ms98-a-0029 166.074625 177.377625 and they have [noise] have certain areas that they plant you know a hundred here and a hundred there and this is of course x number of weeks or months before fishing season opens so
sw3352B-ms98-a-0030 177.377625 180.094000 [silence]
