sw3325A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.759125 [noise] okay_1 well do you have a pet
sw3325A-ms98-a-0002 1.759125 3.063250 [silence]
sw3325A-ms98-a-0003 3.063250 5.621125 two cats you're lucky
sw3325A-ms98-a-0004 5.621125 7.751250 [laughter-you] have two fish
sw3325A-ms98-a-0005 7.751250 14.962875 well uh my husband you know how sometimes when you marry someone that you get along on everything except one major thing
sw3325A-ms98-a-0006 14.962875 23.280625 my husband is a hunter fisherman outdoorsman Marlboro type person who had to have a sporting dog so we have a black Labrador
sw3325A-ms98-a-0007 23.280625 31.344500 beautiful gorgeous black Labrador but to me he belongs up in the field you know in the ranch in the farm and
sw3325A-ms98-a-0008 31.344500 45.591375 well [noise] because we finally negotiated that i was losing my mind um he sleeps in the laundry room and then he goes out for the day but this this is a beautiful dog and he is wonderful with our little girls and he is
sw3325A-ms98-a-0009 45.591375 55.808125 he's comes from a purebred line and there's nothing you could say bad about him except that i was more of a cat or a small dog person that you could sit in the chair and cuddle
sw3325A-ms98-a-0010 55.808125 63.071375 and this is huge you know of course when he runs around the yard he just digs he doesn't know that he's tearing up things but he does
sw3325A-ms98-a-0011 63.071375 72.080000 and the worst part that i had with him he's he's three now was when he was uh about_1 eight months old and i did not know what to expect from a dog having not had one
sw3325A-ms98-a-0012 72.080000 79.397000 and i left him in the kitchen with the little baby gates up while i was gone for about an hour and i came home and he had ripped my wallpaper off my wall
sw3325A-ms98-a-0013 79.397000 81.174375 and it was in the floor
sw3325A-ms98-a-0014 81.174375 86.578375 and i just about lost it and i called and said come home and get your dog [laughter]
sw3325A-ms98-a-0015 86.578375 99.062875 and so he said well puppies just chew when they're nervous and well i wish you had told me you know and it was about eight months later he ate a piece of a linoleum he kept picking at it and i didn't kn[ow]- the the tile in the kitchen and picked a hole in it
sw3325A-ms98-a-0016 99.062875 106.053625 so the last thing he did was when i had set out a whole lot of begonias in the back yard and he dug them all up and brought them to the porch
sw3325A-ms98-a-0017 106.053625 117.182875 and i told my husband i said you know it's either me or the dog and he looked at me like well [laughter-you] [laughter-know] [laughter-so] he loves this dog and every night when he comes home from work he hugs it and talks to him and he's a good dog
sw3325A-ms98-a-0018 117.182875 123.295250 so it's one of those things i'm just having to get used to and that's why i laughed when they called it the topic i thought oh boy do i have a pet
