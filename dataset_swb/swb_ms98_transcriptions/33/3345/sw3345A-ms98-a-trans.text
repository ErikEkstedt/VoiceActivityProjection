sw3345A-ms98-a-0028 106.920625 109.483125 [silence]

sw3345A-ms98-a-0032 114.636250 121.794875 [silence]
sw3345A-ms98-a-0033 121.794875 124.131125 uh-huh yes uh-huh
sw3345A-ms98-a-0034 124.131125 127.876125 oh you've been there well you would be interested in it then
sw3345A-ms98-a-0035 127.876125 135.323625 yeah uh i- i follow it you know i don't just read everything about_1 but i i'm always aware of what's going on like that
sw3345A-ms98-a-0036 135.323625 138.997875 and uh because it is it's interesting
sw3345A-ms98-a-0037 138.997875 144.532375 and uh i i don't know i feel sorry for those people down there they've just been so
sw3345A-ms98-a-0038 144.532375 155.119250 terribly mistreated for so many many years you know i mean through Papa Doc i mean he was a terrible tyrant
sw3345A-ms98-a-0039 155.119250 160.055500 and it i think it's been better since he died but it's still been bad
sw3345A-ms98-a-0040 160.055500 161.772625 but uh
sw3345A-ms98-a-0041 161.772625 163.508500 [silence]
sw3345A-ms98-a-0042 163.508500 173.257750 even that priest that was in control there for a while that they overthrew uh i i've read some things about him that he was he wasn't too good himself
sw3345A-ms98-a-0043 173.257750 178.577625 yeah he was pretty pretty much a he didn't mind having people bumped off for
sw3345A-ms98-a-0044 178.577625 181.003875 certain things you know [noise]
sw3345A-ms98-a-0045 181.003875 182.935125 but uh
sw3345A-ms98-a-0046 182.935125 189.222125 [noise] that's o[ne]- one of the reasons US wasn't so you know didn't do more than they did at the time
sw3345A-ms98-a-0047 189.222125 200.781250 because_1 they weren't all that excited about him although he's probably better than a lot of them_1 but [noise] uh but then again who kn[ow]- you know they're so super so used to it i guess it's the only thing that works
sw3345A-ms98-a-0048 200.781250 202.446375 and not that
sw3345A-ms98-a-0049 202.446375 204.910375 [silence]
sw3345A-ms98-a-0050 204.910375 210.056500 i think it's pretty darned good i think we're lucky to have as good a coverage as we have
sw3345A-ms98-a-0051 210.056500 217.862375 i really do now i uh they sometimes they jump on it an[d]- and and go a little to the extreme the media does but
sw3345A-ms98-a-0052 217.862375 228.497750 uh but that's kind of understandable because_1 you know i[t]- of course if you watch it more th[an]- more than once a day i mean it's the same thing over and over and over and over and i listen to the radio watch 
sw3345A-ms98-a-0053 228.497750 236.044625 so i you hear it so much you get a little tired of it but then again so many people you got to understand only catch it once a day maybe
sw3345A-ms98-a-0054 236.044625 243.463250 but i think the quality of our uh our news is just uh i don't believe it could be better
sw3345A-ms98-a-0055 243.463250 245.403750 i really don't
sw3345A-ms98-a-0056 245.403750 249.429125 [silence]
sw3345A-ms98-a-0057 249.429125 251.033375 i don't think so
sw3345A-ms98-a-0058 251.033375 253.072000 i don't think our news could be better
sw3345A-ms98-a-0059 253.072000 256.353625 i i mean i mean what else could they do to make it better
sw3345A-ms98-a-0060 256.353625 259.461750 i don't see anything that they could do
sw3345A-ms98-a-0061 259.461750 266.521875 [silence]
sw3345A-ms98-a-0062 266.521875 272.650750 well you always wanna think everything can be improved upon i i r[eally]- i understand what you're saying
sw3345A-ms98-a-0063 272.650750 277.372875 but by trial and error over the years i think they got it about_1 as good as they gonna get it
sw3345A-ms98-a-0064 277.372875 278.382125 [silence]
sw3345A-ms98-a-0065 278.382125 281.898375 uh nothing is perfect but
sw3345A-ms98-a-0066 281.898375 283.499750 yeah
sw3345A-ms98-a-0067 283.499750 285.397875 uh-huh
sw3345A-ms98-a-0068 285.397875 289.883750 well th[at's]- uh that's true i understand what you're saying and then again
sw3345A-ms98-a-0069 289.883750 298.370000 i understand why they can't dig too much deeper that's why we have CNN you know CNN has the time since that's all they do is news to dig deeper
