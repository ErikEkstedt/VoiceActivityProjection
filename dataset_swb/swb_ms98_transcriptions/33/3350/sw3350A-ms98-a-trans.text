sw3350A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 2.472500 [noise] what basketball team are you
sw3350A-ms98-a-0002 2.472500 4.070375 most familiar with
sw3350A-ms98-a-0003 4.070375 8.425625 [silence]
sw3350A-ms98-a-0004 8.425625 10.465625 yeah where'd you move from
sw3350A-ms98-a-0005 10.465625 12.046500 uh-huh
sw3350A-ms98-a-0006 12.046500 18.752625 well yeah the Mavericks uh have done fairly well in the past but doesn't look like they're going to do too good this year
sw3350A-ms98-a-0007 18.752625 22.257125 may[be]- maybe they'll surprise us though reckon
sw3350A-ms98-a-0008 22.257125 25.990125 it would be a big su[rprise]- [laughter]
sw3350A-ms98-a-0009 25.990125 35.474000 oh i kind of follow it a little bit i'm not a great fan of it but uh you know i read a little bit about it and follow it on the radio and everything
sw3350A-ms98-a-0010 35.474000 43.483000 but i was glad to see them get rid of that guy Tarpley although by far the best player they've ever had i guess
sw3350A-ms98-a-0011 43.483000 47.864125 [silence]
sw3350A-ms98-a-0012 47.864125 52.670500 yeah it did it did and and they had to do they had to get rid of him
sw3350A-ms98-a-0013 52.670500 58.034375 but i couldn't believe they'd given him a contract like they had where that they couldn't get rid of him
sw3350A-ms98-a-0014 58.034375 59.614000 [silence]
sw3350A-ms98-a-0015 59.614000 61.196125 yeah uh
sw3350A-ms98-a-0016 61.196125 63.926500 i guess they felt like that was enough that
sw3350A-ms98-a-0017 63.926500 65.545250 you know
sw3350A-ms98-a-0018 65.545250 72.753125 uh if that you know if if they had to get out of it they could and they wouldn't want out of it unless he did something wrong
sw3350A-ms98-a-0019 72.753125 75.954250 if he did that well that'd cancel the contract i guess
sw3350A-ms98-a-0020 75.954250 77.600375 [silence]
sw3350A-ms98-a-0021 77.600375 78.850375 yeah
sw3350A-ms98-a-0022 78.850375 80.626500 [silence]
sw3350A-ms98-a-0023 80.626500 84.510000 yes that's right he'd be worth it yeah he'd be worth it
sw3350A-ms98-a-0024 84.510000 86.239625 but there's gonna
sw3350A-ms98-a-0025 86.239625 88.127125 [silence]
sw3350A-ms98-a-0026 88.127125 90.512125 oh they got blasted didn't they
sw3350A-ms98-a-0027 90.512125 91.778500 [silence]
sw3350A-ms98-a-0028 91.778500 93.391750 yeah
sw3350A-ms98-a-0029 93.391750 100.188875 that was unbelievable i- i'd i hadn't seen that score i just heard somebody talking about they'd gotten beaten real bad
sw3350A-ms98-a-0030 100.188875 103.994500 and uh but i think they did better last night though didn't they
sw3350A-ms98-a-0031 103.994500 107.100250 yeah so that was a good game i guess
sw3350A-ms98-a-0032 107.100250 115.998500 [noise] i- i really don't follow them that closely th[ere]- although there was a good article today in the in the Sunday Magazine about uh Brad Davis did you read that
sw3350A-ms98-a-0033 115.998500 117.674250 course uh
sw3350A-ms98-a-0034 117.674250 126.626125 well it just uh this is going to be his last year but it just you know he just been it's amazing that he's one of the original Mavericks you know still playing
sw3350A-ms98-a-0035 126.626125 128.345125 [silence]
sw3350A-ms98-a-0036 128.345125 133.219875 he is the only original Maverick yeah [noise] he started out with them when they started
sw3350A-ms98-a-0037 133.219875 141.584875 [noise] and has made just to make the team every year since then so and you know you don't you don't make the team if you're not any good
sw3350A-ms98-a-0038 141.584875 145.501625 so he's done well six hundred thousand a year
sw3350A-ms98-a-0039 145.501625 147.649250 huh uh-huh
sw3350A-ms98-a-0040 147.649250 149.749625 and he's worth it i guess
sw3350A-ms98-a-0041 149.749625 151.197500 i mean
sw3350A-ms98-a-0042 151.197500 152.731750 huh
sw3350A-ms98-a-0043 152.731750 156.351875 no i don't see how that nah they won't even
sw3350A-ms98-a-0044 156.351875 159.717375 they won't even come close to the play-offs [noise] i don't think
sw3350A-ms98-a-0045 159.717375 161.079250 they w[hat]-
sw3350A-ms98-a-0046 161.079250 166.024000 [silence]
sw3350A-ms98-a-0047 166.024000 168.216375 yeah yeah
sw3350A-ms98-a-0048 168.216375 175.488250 that's a big stretch probably yeah and uh but boy they you know they've had some darn good teams in the past
sw3350A-ms98-a-0049 175.488250 181.109375 i guess that's why it's so hard to swallow you know right off the bat they started doing well
sw3350A-ms98-a-0050 181.109375 182.909750 but
sw3350A-ms98-a-0051 182.909750 186.010875 [silence]
sw3350A-ms98-a-0052 186.010875 190.589875 yeah it makes you they've had some coach problems over the years uh
sw3350A-ms98-a-0053 190.589875 198.550375 [noise] Motta was probably the best they've ever had or ever will have but he i don't know he just he was such a hot head
sw3350A-ms98-a-0054 198.550375 200.960875 that he just quit one time
sw3350A-ms98-a-0055 200.960875 205.312375 and man once he made up his mind to do something like that he gone he don't change his mind
sw3350A-ms98-a-0056 205.312375 208.360625 but he was by far i think the best coach they ever had
sw3350A-ms98-a-0057 208.360625 211.233625 but he couldn't get along with [vocalized-noise]
sw3350A-ms98-a-0058 211.233625 213.676000 i- i mean Aguirre [noise]
sw3350A-ms98-a-0059 213.676000 215.085125 yeah Aguirre
sw3350A-ms98-a-0060 215.085125 218.566875 [noise] and uh he he had a hot temper
sw3350A-ms98-a-0061 218.566875 221.705875 [silence]
sw3350A-ms98-a-0062 221.705875 223.316000 uh-huh
sw3350A-ms98-a-0063 223.316000 225.259375 uh-huh
sw3350A-ms98-a-0064 225.259375 229.130500 yeah probably yeah at least two years ago or longer
sw3350A-ms98-a-0065 229.130500 232.235125 but they did they used to have some darned good teams
sw3350A-ms98-a-0066 232.235125 234.068875 but uh
sw3350A-ms98-a-0067 234.068875 242.648125 i've always been a and i don't follow basketball that closely but i've always been a a Celtics fan because_1 i l[ove]- i love to watch Larry Bird play
sw3350A-ms98-a-0068 242.648125 248.404250 [silence]
sw3350A-ms98-a-0069 248.404250 252.565000 alway[s]- you can always count on them_1 playing a good brand of basketball
sw3350A-ms98-a-0070 252.565000 257.563750 and of course so you can the L[akers]- so can you depend on the Lakers for doing that
sw3350A-ms98-a-0071 257.563750 260.265625 but i don't know i just always liked old
sw3350A-ms98-a-0072 260.265625 262.895625 old Bird he just can do things that
sw3350A-ms98-a-0073 262.895625 270.123000 [laughter-i] [laughter-don't] [laughter-think] [laughter-humans] are supposed to be able to do with a basketball you know him and Magic Johnson and old Jordan
sw3350A-ms98-a-0074 270.123000 273.639625 but we'll have to keep our fingers crossed i guess for the old Mavericks
sw3350A-ms98-a-0075 273.639625 285.156875 well and they got a they got a good owner i mean he's willing to spend the bucks to get what they need so i think it's just a just a matter of time till they it may take them_1 a couple of years
sw3350A-ms98-a-0076 285.156875 291.174625 [silence]
sw3350A-ms98-a-0077 291.174625 293.238875 uh-huh yeah
sw3350A-ms98-a-0078 293.238875 295.280000 and that that's
sw3350A-ms98-a-0079 295.280000 298.510625 yeah that's just too old for a basketball team
sw3350A-ms98-a-0080 298.510625 299.938000 man old old Larry Joh[nson]-
