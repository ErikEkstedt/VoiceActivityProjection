sw3358B-ms98-a-0007 22.980625 33.670125 uh i've i've got a sixty six Mustang out in the back that i've been trying to get running here lately that's given me a lot of problems and th[e]- the clutch and stuff isn't working out right
sw3358B-ms98-a-0008 33.670125 43.932125 and every time i try to put the battery in it doesn't have enough charge on it so i have to take it over to a friend's house and get it charged up again t[ry]- try it again it rained here all last week so i didn't get a chance to do it

sw3358B-ms98-a-0011 57.437625 64.316750 i i i went and got a new battery and brought it home and then it sat there for two weeks so i went over to a friend's house and charged it up
sw3358B-ms98-a-0012 64.316750 73.045625 and then it started raining so i haven't been able to do it for another week so i'll have to take it over there and get it charged again and maybe i'll be able to see if that won't get it going tomorrow
sw3358B-ms98-a-0013 73.045625 74.713625 but uh
sw3358B-ms98-a-0014 74.713625 78.643250 but my main problem's been my clutch i [noise]
sw3358B-ms98-a-0015 78.643250 82.120750 [silence]
sw3358B-ms98-a-0016 82.120750 85.679625 [noise] i'm supposed to [laughter]

sw3358B-ms98-a-0018 88.180750 93.266000 it uh it's been down for quite some time now and i been having a lot of trouble with it
sw3358B-ms98-a-0019 93.266000 96.711125 [silence]
sw3358B-ms98-a-0020 96.711125 101.401125 yeah i have to rely on friends and parents and stuff like that

sw3358B-ms98-a-0022 104.700625 108.263000 so you you don't do any kind of car work or
sw3358B-ms98-a-0023 108.263000 111.651750 try not to anyway [laughter-yeah]
sw3358B-ms98-a-0024 111.651750 114.232125 i can understand that
sw3358B-ms98-a-0025 114.232125 116.022750 yeah i think
sw3358B-ms98-a-0026 116.022750 119.838250 i can understand that i it's not the most fun in the world but
sw3358B-ms98-a-0027 119.838250 130.456750 it it like you said it is it is cheaper on yourself to to go ahead and do it yourself than go spend fifty sixty dollars to have somebody else you know just change your oil or something like that
sw3358B-ms98-a-0028 130.456750 141.823625 [silence]
sw3358B-ms98-a-0029 141.823625 143.521250 yeah yeah
sw3358B-ms98-a-0030 143.521250 152.109000 that's that i think that's what my next option is if the if the clutch doesn't work right to take it to somebody and see if they can't decipher what the problem is
sw3358B-ms98-a-0031 152.109000 161.736750 i i have a feeling maybe it's just that i've i've put too strong of a clutch in it because_1 i've got it's a it's a straight six two hundred with a three speed transmission in it
sw3358B-ms98-a-0032 161.736750 171.155125 and i've tried to put a racing clutch in it which i think is gonna you know i think that may be what my problem is it's it's too much clutch for the amount of engine i've got
sw3358B-ms98-a-0033 171.155125 172.346625 [silence]

sw3358B-ms98-a-0039 192.203500 195.306500 i i have a slight lead foot
