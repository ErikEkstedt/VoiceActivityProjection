sw3380B-ms98-a-0015 62.564125 69.358125 i don't know i just felt it was a real political thing that i don't really think ever got us anywhere you know i don't i don't feel that we

sw3380B-ms98-a-0018 85.432500 100.028625 at such tremendous cost um and i think it was hard for people to keep up good morale in a situation like that i mean i i can't imagine what it was like for the men fighting over there i think that must have been a really hard thing to um
sw3380B-ms98-a-0019 100.028625 111.512750 you know to to keep their morale up uh when they knew that we weren't really trying to win and and all of that so i never was really for it i mean uh
