sw3310B-ms98-a-0042 204.289125 208.955375 i know my mother's in now in a unit that's mainly Alzheimer's
sw3310B-ms98-a-0043 208.955375 210.731375 and um
sw3310B-ms98-a-0044 210.731375 214.887125 we're convinced that she probably would be better off in a geriatric
sw3310B-ms98-a-0045 214.887125 223.598875 uh the fact that these people are [noise] they're up and around but they're they're it's reminds me too much of
sw3310B-ms98-a-0046 223.598875 228.711625 an asylum type s[ituation]- situation and it's very very
sw3310B-ms98-a-0047 228.711625 234.930375 [noise] she well who knows they call it uh dementia
sw3310B-ms98-a-0048 234.930375 239.166625 and uh we don't know i mean she does not know us anymore
sw3310B-ms98-a-0049 239.166625 247.213000 and whether it's Alzheimer's or what it is nobody really knows but it's basically the same and her health is not that bad
sw3310B-ms98-a-0050 247.213000 259.478125 although she has gone down downhill drastically since this this this last well she had been in a retirement community and somewhere in so we're in the back of her mind she had it that she would live with her children well 
sw3310B-ms98-a-0051 259.478125 265.570250 she w[e]- we just did not have the capabilities to to take care of her
sw3310B-ms98-a-0052 265.570250 277.372125 and uh but she she has gone down steadily since she has been in and she's been in the nursing home now for [noise] oh i would say about three months
sw3310B-ms98-a-0053 277.372125 278.645625 and
sw3310B-ms98-a-0054 278.645625 279.665750 [silence]
sw3310B-ms98-a-0055 279.665750 280.835375 i'm sorry
sw3310B-ms98-a-0056 280.835375 282.653125 [silence]
sw3310B-ms98-a-0057 282.653125 286.050375 she no as far as she knew she was going to a hospital
sw3310B-ms98-a-0058 286.050375 298.306000 and that she could she could handle a hospital and we says you know mom if you you know if you get a you get better you've got to have the care the doctor insisted on it you know if you get better that you could come out
