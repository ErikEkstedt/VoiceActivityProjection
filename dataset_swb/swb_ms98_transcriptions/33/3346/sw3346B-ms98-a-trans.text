sw3346B-ms98-a-0003 3.273125 15.410875 well um i- i just think the way that things are going that um that it would be good for young people to go ahead and have um dedicate themselves to at least something
sw3346B-ms98-a-0004 15.410875 22.559875 i know like the Mormon religion you know they require two years of service uh missionary service uh right the boys
sw3346B-ms98-a-0005 22.559875 32.860500 yeah and um so but i think it would be good if for all young people you know to be able to to do something like that um so that um you know
sw3346B-ms98-a-0006 32.860500 36.322250 i- i- i don't know i just feel it would be good for them_1 to do that
sw3346B-ms98-a-0007 36.322250 42.391000 [silence]
sw3346B-ms98-a-0008 42.391000 43.684500 yeah
sw3346B-ms98-a-0009 43.684500 48.112375 [silence]
sw3346B-ms98-a-0010 48.112375 49.703000 um-hum
sw3346B-ms98-a-0011 49.703000 54.803000 [silence]
sw3346B-ms98-a-0012 54.803000 56.288125 oh sure
sw3346B-ms98-a-0013 56.288125 62.331875 oh yeah and and even in even in our home towns there's a lot of um public service things that they could do
sw3346B-ms98-a-0014 62.331875 69.057375 uh you know drug rehabilitation and and alcohol and and just uh helping old people and um
sw3346B-ms98-a-0015 69.057375 77.819375 uh you know helping cripple just helping somebody else and i think that art of giving is something that um we don't have very much any more
sw3346B-ms98-a-0016 77.819375 88.354500 [silence]
sw3346B-ms98-a-0017 88.354500 101.538875 oh i- i think they just gave it a title but it's it's not something that's um in legislation or in works um uh yeah no no it's not it's just a just a topic but
sw3346B-ms98-a-0018 101.538875 114.672750 i- i think so too i think so too um because there's so many um kids who have uh you know so much money and so much free time and uh nothing to do um a[nd]- and nothing to give their time to
sw3346B-ms98-a-0019 114.672750 125.712125 um they don't even have a direction to give their their time to so i think it would be really good for people to um to be able to give their time i[n]- in uh some kind of public service uh even in our government
sw3346B-ms98-a-0020 125.712125 130.151500 you know as uh aids to uh you know Congress uh people
sw3346B-ms98-a-0021 130.151500 133.930000 so um yeah it would be uh it'd be really good i think
sw3346B-ms98-a-0022 133.930000 143.389875 [silence]
sw3346B-ms98-a-0023 143.389875 146.196750 uh-huh right

sw3346B-ms98-a-0025 147.247625 158.922375 oh yeah oh yeah i agree with you yeah this is something that um like you say it's it's character building um you know learning how to to give to others and being less selfish and um
sw3346B-ms98-a-0026 158.922375 162.209000 [silence]

sw3346B-ms98-a-0031 170.599000 181.573000 oh i agree with you i agree with you and and i think uh young people are so um uh focused just on themselves and their activities and whose going out with whom et cetera that uh
sw3346B-ms98-a-0032 181.573000 188.968250 you know to get a taste of what the real world is actually about uh you know doing that that public service would be great yeah
sw3346B-ms98-a-0033 188.968250 193.642875 [silence]

sw3346B-ms98-a-0037 203.501250 215.468500 oh yeah i would think so like right after um high school you know e[ven]- even if it was like the the the their um that summer right after high school you know three months
sw3346B-ms98-a-0038 215.468500 218.901625 [silence]

sw3346B-ms98-a-0043 231.998625 234.034000 right right
sw3346B-ms98-a-0044 234.034000 238.062625 you know something that was that was outside of uh outside of school
sw3346B-ms98-a-0045 238.062625 243.716625 yeah but yeah you know right right after you graduate from uh high school because_1 a lot of people are just um
sw3346B-ms98-a-0046 243.716625 254.687875 uh well gee whiz what do i do now i[f]- if they're not focused on going to college and uh you know having that that uh gung ho plan uh that's you know setting their life goals
sw3346B-ms98-a-0047 254.687875 256.350375 um-hum
sw3346B-ms98-a-0048 256.350375 266.222375 um-hum yeah so to me see that would be the the uh the greatest time for um you know uh teenagers to to do that would be right after they graduated from high school
sw3346B-ms98-a-0049 266.222375 274.600625 but as for it being required [laughter] you know we're we're just not we're not based on [laughter-on] on that uh type of a system um
sw3346B-ms98-a-0050 274.600625 277.842125 [silence]
