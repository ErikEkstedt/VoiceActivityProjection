sw3343B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.470375 [noise]
sw3343B-ms98-a-0002 0.470375 6.435250 [silence]
sw3343B-ms98-a-0003 6.435250 20.054125 well i haven't either uh i i hate returning things i mean i ha[ve]- i have a friend who if she likes something isn't sure what size somebody might need will buy it in every color and size and
sw3343B-ms98-a-0004 20.054125 30.524250 you know take everything back [laughter-again] it's you know it's a game to her but i i do not like to do [laughter-that] i consider it kind of a a waste of my time and so i'm usually
sw3343B-ms98-a-0005 30.524250 42.397500 uh pretty careful when i shop and i also you know usually have have checked over things you know if it's like an appliance or something to make sure um
sw3343B-ms98-a-0006 42.397500 48.574000 it has the features in it that i want now we've had one lately um
sw3343B-ms98-a-0007 48.574000 58.617875 oh a uh a Dustbuster Plus that we bought and we've had it for a while but all of a sudden it just wasn't working and
sw3343B-ms98-a-0008 58.617875 69.906375 it looks like there's a part missing from it my husband opened it up and whatever and of course we don't have the [laughter-receipt] [laughter-any] [laughter-more] [laughter-so] we can't take it back uh uh but
sw3343B-ms98-a-0009 69.906375 75.826875 i[t]- i think a lot of goods are made not to last real long
sw3343B-ms98-a-0010 75.826875 77.617500 uh
sw3343B-ms98-a-0011 77.617500 80.509000 [silence]
sw3343B-ms98-a-0012 80.509000 81.698875 yeah
sw3343B-ms98-a-0013 81.698875 83.079875 [silence]
sw3343B-ms98-a-0014 83.079875 95.853125 well that's true and lot of times though it is it costs so much to get something fixed that you almost are just as well off buying another one you know if it's oh
sw3343B-ms98-a-0015 95.853125 105.697875 [silence]
sw3343B-ms98-a-0016 105.697875 107.254625 um-hum
sw3343B-ms98-a-0017 107.254625 112.052875 [silence]
sw3343B-ms98-a-0018 112.052875 123.322750 well yeah i think a lot of times if you get a brand name uh you know if it's a a good brand i you i think there's there can be a lemon in anything
sw3343B-ms98-a-0019 123.322750 130.110750 but uh i think more often than not you you pretty well know what you're getting ahead of time and uh
sw3343B-ms98-a-0020 130.110750 140.976625 you know if if you buy a good one you shouldn't have any you know too much of a problem with it i mean we we had a car once that we tried to have declared a lemon under the lemon law
sw3343B-ms98-a-0021 140.976625 143.351250 which is ex[tremely]-
sw3343B-ms98-a-0022 143.351250 156.428875 extremely difficult to do we never could get it [laughter-declared] a lemon and the car would go and without any warning what so ever you could be going down the freeway at sixty and it would stop
sw3343B-ms98-a-0023 156.428875 169.176750 and i there was just you know and oh we went round and round with the manufacturer and and everything and they got it finally {semifixed} but it was such a hassle
sw3343B-ms98-a-0024 169.176750 171.106000 yeah
sw3343B-ms98-a-0025 171.106000 175.750000 yeah yeah it it really is uh
sw3343B-ms98-a-0026 175.750000 183.835000 but gee [laughter] this is of all the topics i have had i'm doing this thing this is kind of the strangest one
sw3343B-ms98-a-0027 183.835000 191.804000 [silence]
sw3343B-ms98-a-0028 191.804000 193.264625 um-hum
sw3343B-ms98-a-0029 193.264625 203.356625 [silence]
sw3343B-ms98-a-0030 203.356625 210.465250 well i think that's true and i uh now we generally don't buy a warranty because you think
sw3343B-ms98-a-0031 210.465250 214.367500 you know at least for the first couple of years nothing should go wrong with it
sw3343B-ms98-a-0032 214.367500 219.891125 [silence]
sw3343B-ms98-a-0033 219.891125 221.194625 uh-huh
sw3343B-ms98-a-0034 221.194625 226.105750 [silence]
sw3343B-ms98-a-0035 226.105750 227.534375 um-hum
sw3343B-ms98-a-0036 227.534375 228.937625 um-hum
sw3343B-ms98-a-0037 228.937625 242.088250 [silence]
sw3343B-ms98-a-0038 242.088250 254.949375 ye[s]- i think technology is better i'm i'm not sure i think you've got a good point with the plastic and that i don't think necessarily that things are being made better uh
sw3343B-ms98-a-0039 254.949375 269.552750 you know i i everything is so automated uh and things can be made without [laughter-i] [laughter-think] a human hand ever [laughter-touching] [laughter-it] [laughter-you] [laughter-know] an awful lot of things and i think uh that certainly makes a difference from
sw3343B-ms98-a-0040 269.552750 275.658750 back from the time when somebody hand crafted something and you know had some pride in it
sw3343B-ms98-a-0041 275.658750 280.695375 [silence]
sw3343B-ms98-a-0042 280.695375 284.787125 well yeah that's that's true
sw3343B-ms98-a-0043 284.787125 299.618000 yeah well i i do uh you know craft work and sell stuff at shows and that and uh uh you know it's it's it's a real eye opener as far as you know why people charge what they do to you know
