sw3343A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 6.806625 okay when they first said the subject my mind went kind of blank i thought gee i [laughter-haven't] taken anything back for a long time
sw3343A-ms98-a-0002 6.806625 12.527125 [silence]

sw3343A-ms98-a-0014 68.155750 74.839250 [silence]
sw3343A-ms98-a-0015 74.839250 84.057250 right right just to get you by five years and then you'll throw it away rather than have it fixed we're we're a wasteful society for sure
sw3343A-ms98-a-0016 84.057250 88.691000 [silence]
sw3343A-ms98-a-0017 88.691000 90.154500 right
sw3343A-ms98-a-0018 90.154500 93.250625 [silence]
sw3343A-ms98-a-0019 93.250625 105.307750 right and you usually get what you pay for it we bought some walkie-talkies a couple of years ago for Christmas and they were like ten dollars and we expected them_1 [laughter] to work nice for the little kids and
sw3343A-ms98-a-0020 105.307750 113.679125 they didn't work worth anything [laughter] so we took those back and that's about that all that [laughter-i] [laughter-can] [laughter-remember] taking back in ages so
sw3343A-ms98-a-0021 113.679125 115.311375 [silence]
sw3343A-ms98-a-0022 115.311375 116.853250 yeah
sw3343A-ms98-a-0023 116.853250 122.527375 [silence]
sw3343A-ms98-a-0024 122.527375 123.998375 right
sw3343A-ms98-a-0025 123.998375 129.318125 [silence]
sw3343A-ms98-a-0026 129.318125 130.717250 right
sw3343A-ms98-a-0027 130.717250 139.757875 [silence]
sw3343A-ms98-a-0028 139.757875 141.855250 oh really
sw3343A-ms98-a-0029 141.855250 144.414000 it's hard [laughter]
sw3343A-ms98-a-0030 144.414000 155.529000 [silence]
sw3343A-ms98-a-0031 155.529000 157.171000 oh wow
sw3343A-ms98-a-0032 157.171000 168.442875 [silence]
sw3343A-ms98-a-0033 168.442875 172.579250 um-hum and it's just a pain to [laughter-ha[ve]-] deal with
sw3343A-ms98-a-0034 172.579250 182.302875 [silence]
sw3343A-ms98-a-0035 182.302875 193.218875 [laughter] i at first i thought of food you know because_1 that's what mainly what i [laughter-buy] [laughter-it] [laughter-seems] [laughter-like] and uh you know i still don't have any anything to do there but
sw3343A-ms98-a-0036 193.218875 202.812625 but i i think too a lot of people don't buy their warranties either because they know that when it's that old they're going to buy a new one
sw3343A-ms98-a-0037 202.812625 204.159625 so
sw3343A-ms98-a-0038 204.159625 213.265750 [silence]
sw3343A-ms98-a-0039 213.265750 221.005750 yeah my husband is really good at fixing things too so he'll usually be able to fix anything that's minor and
sw3343A-ms98-a-0040 221.005750 229.028625 and that has saved us thousands of dollars [vocalized-noise] you know from plumbing to mechanic to anything like that but 
sw3343A-ms98-a-0041 229.028625 242.642750 but it was interesting to i don't know if they're making them_1 better or not i it's hard to say some i think they make more of their parts plastic which you know make things break easier but i think the technology's better
sw3343A-ms98-a-0042 242.642750 245.801250 [silence]
sw3343A-ms98-a-0043 245.801250 248.069875 that quality [laughter]
sw3343A-ms98-a-0044 248.069875 252.538750 [silence]
sw3343A-ms98-a-0045 252.538750 254.011375 right
sw3343A-ms98-a-0046 254.011375 261.684625 [silence]

sw3343A-ms98-a-0048 263.406625 266.322750 yeah that's true
sw3343A-ms98-a-0049 266.322750 274.632875 [silence]
sw3343A-ms98-a-0050 274.632875 287.625375 right well people aren't willing to pay those prices very often so you know for a handcrafted something so [noise] so i guess we [laughter-get] [laughter-what] [laughter-we] what we deserve [laughter]
sw3343A-ms98-a-0051 287.625375 289.308250 [silence]
sw3343A-ms98-a-0052 289.308250 292.287375 [noise]
