sw3386B-ms98-a-0002 6.960375 15.079750 [silence]

sw3386B-ms98-a-0005 25.823750 29.657750 okay well i i tend to
sw3386B-ms98-a-0006 29.657750 33.480250 be more methodical i guess uh
sw3386B-ms98-a-0007 33.480250 36.038125 [noise] i determine
sw3386B-ms98-a-0008 36.038125 39.552875 first of all what i'm gonna use the vehicle for
sw3386B-ms98-a-0009 39.552875 51.468000 whether it's going to be primarily as a family mover or as a a personal mover uh where it's gonna be driven you know what types
sw3386B-ms98-a-0010 51.468000 53.608500 of uh driving
sw3386B-ms98-a-0011 53.608500 59.369500 i'm going to be doing on it primarily highway or or local mileage more often
sw3386B-ms98-a-0012 59.369500 61.256750 and uh
sw3386B-ms98-a-0013 61.256750 62.322750 [silence]
sw3386B-ms98-a-0014 62.322750 69.446000 hanging in the back of my mind is always the knowledge that i tend to drive cars for about ten years
sw3386B-ms98-a-0015 69.446000 72.371000 at a hundred fifty to two hundred thousand miles
sw3386B-ms98-a-0016 72.371000 73.672500 [silence]
sw3386B-ms98-a-0017 73.672500 75.224875 so i'm
sw3386B-ms98-a-0018 75.224875 84.700750 i'm real picky i[f]- i[f]- if you're gonna keep something that long [laughter] you know you better get something that you wanted to begin with and that you['re]- you're gonna like for a long time
sw3386B-ms98-a-0019 84.700750 123.259125 [silence]
sw3386B-ms98-a-0020 123.259125 128.375500 sure well it sounds like you tend to drive your cars quite a ways a also then
sw3386B-ms98-a-0021 128.375500 134.008125 [silence]
sw3386B-ms98-a-0022 134.008125 135.469750 [laughter]
sw3386B-ms98-a-0023 135.469750 152.553000 [silence]
sw3386B-ms98-a-0024 152.553000 155.053750 that's true uh do you have
sw3386B-ms98-a-0025 155.053750 160.749250 more than o[ne]- o[ne]- than one vehicle in your fleet uh do you have a family fleet or
sw3386B-ms98-a-0026 160.749250 181.077625 [silence]
sw3386B-ms98-a-0027 181.077625 190.851750 well that may be they Chrysler made some really good old engines back then like the the three eighteen was particularly an exceptionally good engine
sw3386B-ms98-a-0028 190.851750 198.385375 [silence]
sw3386B-ms98-a-0029 198.385375 209.132375 [noise] yeah at the moment i've got a Cadillac Cimarron which is approaching its tenth year of age and a uh
sw3386B-ms98-a-0030 209.132375 215.070125 reasonably new Plymouth Voyager it's only a a couple of years old
sw3386B-ms98-a-0031 215.070125 224.971875 but that's the second one of of those that we've had that's the the family travel vehicle you know not only does it do all the
sw3386B-ms98-a-0032 224.971875 228.686500 the uh carpooling around
sw3386B-ms98-a-0033 228.686500 233.722625 during the week but it's also the vacation vehicle that we all drive in
sw3386B-ms98-a-0034 233.722625 235.712625 [silence]
sw3386B-ms98-a-0035 235.712625 242.643250 i think that what i'm getting ready to get next is probably a Suburban unless they drastically change
sw3386B-ms98-a-0036 242.643250 243.802375 the
sw3386B-ms98-a-0037 243.802375 248.365000 the vehicle a lot uh i'm just getting tired of
sw3386B-ms98-a-0038 248.365000 257.241625 when i do get hung up in traffic not being able to determine what the problem is and and come to some resolution
sw3386B-ms98-a-0039 257.241625 258.519250 of
sw3386B-ms98-a-0040 258.519250 265.659625 whether it's better to sit in the traffic light and wait or get off at the next exit that kind of stuff just because i can't see
sw3386B-ms98-a-0041 265.659625 274.942125 yeah i'm too my Cimarron is just so small and so low to the ground that i can't see past any [laughter-vehicle] that's in front of me
sw3386B-ms98-a-0042 274.942125 298.178000 [silence]
