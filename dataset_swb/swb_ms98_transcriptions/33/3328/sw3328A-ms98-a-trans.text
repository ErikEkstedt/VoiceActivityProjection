sw3328A-ms98-a-0007 48.189625 55.068500 oh it seems like a big politics game like up here last year the governor's up for reelection so
sw3328A-ms98-a-0008 55.068500 64.070500 he said the budget was fine an[d]- tha[t]- the state didn't have any money and then right after he won the election he said we owed a lot of money so they raised all our taxes
sw3328A-ms98-a-0009 64.070500 68.727000 and now it's election time again so they're trying to lower them_1
sw3328A-ms98-a-0010 68.727000 73.172250 so they're just talk about lowering them_1 but they never do they just keep raising them_1
sw3328A-ms98-a-0011 73.172250 75.539250 [silence]
sw3328A-ms98-a-0012 75.539250 88.150000 yeah me neither well actually they're going to here because they didn't have a budget for so long so they raised the tax rate real high for the last three months of this year and they're gonna lower it for next year
sw3328A-ms98-a-0013 88.150000 89.280375 [silence]
sw3328A-ms98-a-0014 89.280375 93.700625 i guess they figure they're gonna make up for all they didn't get when they should've had a budget
sw3328A-ms98-a-0015 93.700625 96.074000 [silence]

sw3328A-ms98-a-0019 138.053750 140.413500 [silence]
sw3328A-ms98-a-0020 140.413500 149.125250 yeah i mean if you're in the the three three percent bracket and they take a third of your check every month well that's ridiculous why bother working
sw3328A-ms98-a-0021 149.125250 157.629375 [silence]
sw3328A-ms98-a-0022 157.629375 162.103000 well they should just tax everybody the same amount no matter what you make
sw3328A-ms98-a-0023 162.103000 163.821375 that'd be fair
sw3328A-ms98-a-0024 163.821375 164.970000 [silence]
