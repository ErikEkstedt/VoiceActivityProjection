sw3320A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 2.499750 [noise] we're supposed to talk about crime in the city
sw3320A-ms98-a-0002 2.499750 7.562000 and uh [noise] seems like all big cities have plenty of that nowadays doesn't it
sw3320A-ms98-a-0003 7.562000 20.490000 [silence]
sw3320A-ms98-a-0004 20.490000 26.458875 well it is but our crimes up here uh is i think it must be in most cities now
sw3320A-ms98-a-0005 26.458875 36.470000 but i was listening to the news the other day and they said they thought a lot of it the reason it was up so was because of the uh so many people are without work nowadays
sw3320A-ms98-a-0006 36.470000 38.165875 economy's so bad
sw3320A-ms98-a-0007 38.165875 43.210875 [silence]
sw3320A-ms98-a-0008 43.210875 50.126375 [laughter] [laughter-well] that's a good [laughter-point] [laughter] [noise] that's just what they quoted over the news
sw3320A-ms98-a-0009 50.126375 54.991125 uh i don't know if i'll believe that or not but it it does seem up and uh
sw3320A-ms98-a-0010 54.991125 56.970000 [silence]
sw3320A-ms98-a-0011 56.970000 58.913875 what kind
sw3320A-ms98-a-0012 58.913875 66.716125 well we got a i think we got a pretty good newspaper uh we have two the Morning News and the uh Times Herald
sw3320A-ms98-a-0013 66.716125 76.815625 Morning News seems to have the largest circulation i think it's a pretty good it's a locally owned paper the Herald is owned i think by the Times out of uh LA or somewhere
sw3320A-ms98-a-0014 76.815625 78.239000 but
sw3320A-ms98-a-0015 78.239000 80.211375 [silence]
sw3320A-ms98-a-0016 80.211375 85.105000 well they don't no not really uh they don't play it up i don't think uh [noise]
sw3320A-ms98-a-0017 85.105000 86.159625 [silence]
sw3320A-ms98-a-0018 86.159625 95.042250 [noise] but there there is too much of it you know uh too many homes broken into we had our our fact about uh last year sometime our home was broken into
sw3320A-ms98-a-0019 95.042250 96.058375 we
sw3320A-ms98-a-0020 96.058375 97.104125 [silence]
sw3320A-ms98-a-0021 97.104125 104.357750 yeah we uh uh i didn't think ours ever would be burgled into burgled but so many in our neighborhood had been
sw3320A-ms98-a-0022 104.357750 110.848125 and uh because we live on a corner and back up to a real uh highly traveled main
sw3320A-ms98-a-0023 110.848125 115.040375 street but uh we were so uh
sw3320A-ms98-a-0024 115.040375 117.875250 [silence]
sw3320A-ms98-a-0025 117.875250 123.261875 sort of yeah and i never did get a security system but since that happened i certainly have
sw3320A-ms98-a-0026 123.261875 124.448000 [silence]
sw3320A-ms98-a-0027 124.448000 131.189250 it's uh [noise] uh [noise] i guess excuse me just a standard uh [noise]
sw3320A-ms98-a-0028 131.189250 135.328750 [noise] with the uh all the doors and uh
sw3320A-ms98-a-0029 135.328750 141.015125 uh infrared thing you know motion detector pre[tty]- pretty standard
sw3320A-ms98-a-0030 141.015125 142.825875 [silence]
sw3320A-ms98-a-0031 142.825875 146.386875 yes yes it's monitored and all that uh
sw3320A-ms98-a-0032 146.386875 147.658125 and
sw3320A-ms98-a-0033 147.658125 152.463875 [silence]
sw3320A-ms98-a-0034 152.463875 159.149125 i think uh the thing that makes a lot of noise would would suffice i really do
sw3320A-ms98-a-0035 159.149125 162.711250 but uh this deal that was part of it for you know
sw3320A-ms98-a-0036 162.711250 166.603375 three years or so you pay the unit off or whatever
sw3320A-ms98-a-0037 166.603375 168.303750 and uh
sw3320A-ms98-a-0038 168.303750 172.761000 but it uh the monitoring's not that bad though because uh
sw3320A-ms98-a-0039 172.761000 177.108000 uh we've goofed it up you know several times you'll hit the
sw3320A-ms98-a-0040 177.108000 190.323500 wrong key not intentionally or something and [noise] and they call back pretty quickly so i- i guess it's you know i think it's all right but i to answer your question i think uh uh i think uh that is a pretty good deterrent in itself whether it
sw3320A-ms98-a-0041 190.323500 191.718000 [silence]
sw3320A-ms98-a-0042 191.718000 193.999750 [noise] um-hum
sw3320A-ms98-a-0043 193.999750 196.468500 [silence]
sw3320A-ms98-a-0044 196.468500 204.815000 well it's got a back up system that doesn't work supposedly tha[t]- uh if it's cut supposedly it notifies them_1 anyway
sw3320A-ms98-a-0045 204.815000 207.919625 supposedly who knows you know
sw3320A-ms98-a-0046 207.919625 212.118375 but that's the selling point and i think they're probably i think it probably does these things are
sw3320A-ms98-a-0047 212.118375 213.125625 [silence]
sw3320A-ms98-a-0048 213.125625 215.770625 supp[osedly]- supposedly pretty good
sw3320A-ms98-a-0049 215.770625 220.219750 [noise] boy they sure advertise them_1 you know so many of them nowadays
sw3320A-ms98-a-0050 220.219750 224.838625 but uh well don't y['all]- don't y'all have a pretty high crime rate up there
sw3320A-ms98-a-0051 224.838625 225.911750 [silence]
sw3320A-ms98-a-0052 225.911750 233.064875 i'm not saying it's any higher than anybody else's down here we seem to or or not here but the statistics seem to say that i don't know
sw3320A-ms98-a-0053 233.064875 234.603875 [silence]
sw3320A-ms98-a-0054 234.603875 236.424375 is that right
sw3320A-ms98-a-0055 236.424375 240.563000 [vocalized-noise] i would gather probably from drugs
sw3320A-ms98-a-0056 240.563000 244.431500 and i think that's the reason it's so high everywhere
sw3320A-ms98-a-0057 244.431500 253.050375 but i don't think there's anyplace [noise] used to years ago you thought well these little small cities and all [noise] wouldn't have that problem but they do
sw3320A-ms98-a-0058 253.050375 259.228625 we've had relatives that their children were just as involved in it uh as anyone you know
sw3320A-ms98-a-0059 259.228625 261.536750 [silence]
sw3320A-ms98-a-0060 261.536750 266.640500 that's a good question i don't know i don't know what the solution is i really don't
sw3320A-ms98-a-0061 266.640500 268.714875 [silence]
sw3320A-ms98-a-0062 268.714875 270.165125 yeah
sw3320A-ms98-a-0063 270.165125 271.677000 yep
sw3320A-ms98-a-0064 271.677000 281.606875 the and nothing seems to change and uh i'm not sure that anything will because these [vocalized-noise] if something could happen to make these people not wanna buy it 
sw3320A-ms98-a-0065 281.606875 289.387375 uh but they wanna buy it so supplying and demand long as somebody wants to buy it somebody's gonna provide it for them_1
sw3320A-ms98-a-0066 289.387375 290.740375 [silence]
sw3320A-ms98-a-0067 290.740375 294.934875 so i don't know i don't [vocalized-noise] you know i don't know what the solution is i really don't
sw3320A-ms98-a-0068 294.934875 298.402000 i don't think anyone does in fact
