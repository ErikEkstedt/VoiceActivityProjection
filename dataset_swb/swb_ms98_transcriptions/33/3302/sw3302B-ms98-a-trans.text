sw3302B-ms98-a-0023 111.964125 116.768500 well i wonder wh[at]- i don't know what the statistics are but i think uh
sw3302B-ms98-a-0024 116.768500 124.126750 it's uh the numbers of of people infected do you know an[y]- have any idea what they are what they're estimating now

sw3302B-ms98-a-0027 127.221375 129.327500 well i you know what i[t]-
sw3302B-ms98-a-0028 129.327500 142.145625 yeah what what i think is that is that somehow in in ou[r]- m[ost]- a lot of our minds it's still a disease that affects primarily homosexuals and intravenous drug users
sw3302B-ms98-a-0029 142.145625 146.336000 but what we're finding is that that that it's
sw3302B-ms98-a-0030 146.336000 153.882375 it's um als[o]- it's affecting a lot more people than that that that there's a lot more um uh
sw3302B-ms98-a-0031 153.882375 158.310750 heterosexual transmission of the disease than than we probably thought
sw3302B-ms98-a-0032 158.310750 159.953875 so
sw3302B-ms98-a-0033 159.953875 164.154375 an[d]- you know i mean as long it's as long as it's um limited to those
sw3302B-ms98-a-0034 164.154375 175.400625 two select you know two kind of narrow areas homosexuals and intravenous drug users it it it's probably gonna get unfortunately sad to say a lot more lip service than it will actually actually dollars
sw3302B-ms98-a-0035 175.400625 183.841375 and uh it might be that [noise] as it spreads among the general population more that that uh
sw3302B-ms98-a-0036 183.841375 188.588000 you know and and in all these stories about these kids who had transfusions and these
sw3302B-ms98-a-0037 188.588000 198.896500 oh there's been a couple housewives lately that were you know national news that they had had trans[fusions]- trans[fusions]- uh -[trans]fusions and they you know and they're they're they died you [laughter-know] [laughter-and] left behind families and

sw3302B-ms98-a-0061 267.486250 279.512750 yeah an[d]- and i think as long as it's uh as long as it's still people that are thinking that it's mostly even people that that it's almost like because they're choosing to practice those lifestyles that they're choo[sing]- you know that's their choice
sw3302B-ms98-a-0062 279.512750 284.158125 that they ran that risk i mean i you know that's prob[ably]- i hate to say that that sounds cr[uel]-
sw3302B-ms98-a-0063 284.158125 287.770125 uh that sounds c[old]- cold and cruel but that's probably
sw3302B-ms98-a-0064 287.770125 296.665000 as long as people perceive of it being that way i- i mean that probably explains the lack of um lack of concrete money and being spent
sw3302B-ms98-a-0065 296.665000 298.402000 yep
