sw3383A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 4.669125 [noise] seem to have the topic already on top of the tip of your tongue there so why don't you go ahead and start
sw3383A-ms98-a-0002 4.669125 6.234750 [silence]
sw3383A-ms98-a-0003 6.234750 7.710375 yes sir
sw3383A-ms98-a-0004 7.710375 13.966750 [silence]
sw3383A-ms98-a-0005 13.966750 15.387625 okay
sw3383A-ms98-a-0006 15.387625 22.923125 [silence]

sw3383A-ms98-a-0008 26.656625 38.310250 [silence]
sw3383A-ms98-a-0009 38.310250 40.820500 i sure do i uh
sw3383A-ms98-a-0010 40.820500 55.042875 in fact the last thing i ha[ve]- i've done i- c[an't]- i don't even remember what it is i've had to have oil changes done myself because i live in an apartment complex where we're not allowed to work on our vehicle we can't even wash our vehicle so
sw3383A-ms98-a-0011 55.042875 57.362125 uh but
sw3383A-ms98-a-0012 57.362125 67.444375 the last thing i can remember doing wh[ere]- i had a sixty six Mustang and that was all right because like you said that was pretechnology days i guess
sw3383A-ms98-a-0013 67.444375 76.315625 and uh you know you could do a lot of it yourself still and uh i didn't tinker too much with the engine it was it was in pretty good shape but
sw3383A-ms98-a-0014 76.315625 90.217625 my main concern and what i enjoy doing was was the interior and uh it was it was pretty shelled uh but it was fun it taking the whole thing you know the whole interior apart and ordering new carpeting and
sw3383A-ms98-a-0015 90.217625 91.719750 uh
sw3383A-ms98-a-0016 91.719750 92.852750 [silence]
sw3383A-ms98-a-0017 92.852750 95.348875 right and
sw3383A-ms98-a-0018 95.348875 103.741750 it it was i my wife enjoyed uh she you know helped out a little we sanded down the the insides of the door panels
sw3383A-ms98-a-0019 103.741750 106.283875 and painted those and
sw3383A-ms98-a-0020 106.283875 108.573625 no i sold it
sw3383A-ms98-a-0021 108.573625 114.170125 [silence]
sw3383A-ms98-a-0022 114.170125 122.675250 yeah it was fun though it was fun i- i really enjoyed it and i was surprised at at uh the availability of parts yet
sw3383A-ms98-a-0023 122.675250 127.416750 you know you can you can still get factory original parts
sw3383A-ms98-a-0024 127.416750 132.700500 but uh you pay a premium but you just don't get them_1 i- i didn't i went ahead and got
sw3383A-ms98-a-0025 132.700500 140.290375 y[ou]- you know Japanese made duplicates or wherever they were made Canada you know prefabs and all that stuff but
sw3383A-ms98-a-0026 140.290375 149.523000 [silence]
sw3383A-ms98-a-0027 149.523000 151.997375 well actually there was
sw3383A-ms98-a-0028 151.997375 160.694875 and uh i had heard rumors that it was because they couldn't duplicate [noise] certain patterns uh exactly
sw3383A-ms98-a-0029 160.694875 170.517625 and so like the the glove box was just a little little wider little harder to fit in and the carpeting uh
sw3383A-ms98-a-0030 170.517625 174.482125 stretched a little too far i had to cut some of the sides down
sw3383A-ms98-a-0031 174.482125 185.641875 but just just little things you know one of the screws on on the door regulat[or]- uh window regulators you could get three of the three of the four to lineup the fourth one you couldn't get to lineup no matter what you did
sw3383A-ms98-a-0032 185.641875 187.334875 you know thing [vocalized-noise]
sw3383A-ms98-a-0033 187.334875 200.353125 oh it was but the end result is after you put your your panels on nobody sees that [laughter-you] got one screw missing in your your window regulator anyway and it it runs it works just the same so
sw3383A-ms98-a-0034 200.353125 226.235500 [silence]
sw3383A-ms98-a-0035 226.235500 229.710250 disc brakes don't seem to give me too much problem but
sw3383A-ms98-a-0036 229.710250 243.496125 i- i honestly i don't have the tools for the drum i know you got uh certain spring lever that you got to have or some uh some spring pulley or something that you got to pull that spring back over onto that notch
sw3383A-ms98-a-0037 243.496125 250.889625 uh my dad's got all that and and i- i helped him when i was growing up but i don't have that stuff now comes to drum brakes i
sw3383A-ms98-a-0038 250.889625 254.247875 you know don't have any choice but to take them_1 in
sw3383A-ms98-a-0039 254.247875 267.828250 [silence]
