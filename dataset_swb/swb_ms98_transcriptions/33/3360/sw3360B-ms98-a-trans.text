sw3360B-ms98-a-0006 44.709750 48.890125 that kind of ticks you off too but uh
sw3360B-ms98-a-0007 48.890125 53.222375 somebody somebody was telling me the other day that they heard
sw3360B-ms98-a-0008 53.222375 55.749500 some senator say that
sw3360B-ms98-a-0009 55.749500 58.009125 what we're paying
sw3360B-ms98-a-0010 58.009125 65.622375 it's not that we mind paying taxes it's that we're paying too much for a lousy government

sw3360B-ms98-a-0012 71.313375 78.611625 what they're doing per se and i think there's just too many too many levels of bureaucracy
sw3360B-ms98-a-0013 78.611625 80.862750 i think it can be
sw3360B-ms98-a-0014 80.862750 83.541000 can be managed by
sw3360B-ms98-a-0015 83.541000 85.686750 by less ah
sw3360B-ms98-a-0016 85.686750 87.503500 less levels
