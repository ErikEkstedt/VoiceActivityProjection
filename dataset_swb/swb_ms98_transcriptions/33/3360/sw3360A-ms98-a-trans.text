sw3360A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 10.515000 [noise] ah i guess my personal opinion i- i don't mind paying taxes necessarily i I just sometimes wonder if our money's being used in the best way
sw3360A-ms98-a-0002 10.515000 22.450000 ah sometimes when i hear what what they're even wha[t]- even what the politicians are making you know when when they're getting a hundred and fifty thousand plus benefits and that ah
sw3360A-ms98-a-0003 22.450000 26.874625 [noise] i think that's just a bit too much to be paying them ah
sw3360A-ms98-a-0004 26.874625 36.445625 and that's all tax money when you figure out how many politicians and each one getting that much it's just billions of dollars that's i think is just being thrown away
