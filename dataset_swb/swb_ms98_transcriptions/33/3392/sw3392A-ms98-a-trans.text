sw3392A-ms98-a-0025 145.501750 150.110625 i- i prefer having someone that uh has some knowledge in that and
sw3392A-ms98-a-0026 150.110625 154.874750 and i uh help and learn and uh go that route but
sw3392A-ms98-a-0027 154.874750 162.930125 if i had to tackle s[omething]- you know building an addition totally by myself uh i wouldn't enjoy it at all

sw3392A-ms98-a-0040 210.223750 213.547500 yeah i guess lot of times when uh i don't know
sw3392A-ms98-a-0041 213.547500 217.233375 when you're pressed for time and have to do it and
sw3392A-ms98-a-0042 217.233375 220.968750 wanna get it done then it doesn't become fun anymore
sw3392A-ms98-a-0043 220.968750 221.987875 [silence]
sw3392A-ms98-a-0044 221.987875 229.159500 i think the the smaller projects tend to be more fun something you can finish in you know maybe a week or something but
sw3392A-ms98-a-0045 229.159500 235.324625 [silence]
sw3392A-ms98-a-0046 235.324625 241.643875 yeah yeah well uh especially uh stuff like roofing when you're doing it in
sw3392A-ms98-a-0047 241.643875 244.333250 ninety to a hundred degree weather and uh
sw3392A-ms98-a-0048 244.333250 246.383875 [silence]

sw3392A-ms98-a-0054 263.782000 265.743875 it's real hard to handle
sw3392A-ms98-a-0055 265.743875 269.890250 [silence]
sw3392A-ms98-a-0056 269.890250 273.181125 well i don't know about you but i'm i'm about out uh
