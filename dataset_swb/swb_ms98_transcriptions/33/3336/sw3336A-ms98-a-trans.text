sw3336A-ms98-a-0005 10.470500 14.982125 [silence]

sw3336A-ms98-a-0007 16.401000 24.660875 [silence]

sw3336A-ms98-a-0009 26.682500 38.659875 [silence]
sw3336A-ms98-a-0010 38.659875 40.050500 oh
sw3336A-ms98-a-0011 40.050500 46.074250 [silence]
sw3336A-ms98-a-0012 46.074250 52.256000 well uh it's just like the money it's hard to keep track of it [laughter] as it goes out
sw3336A-ms98-a-0013 52.256000 61.039750 uh i'm a teacher and we're at a my husband and i are at a stage in life where we've got one left in college
sw3336A-ms98-a-0014 61.039750 70.419000 so budgeting is not our priority since we have one in college [laughter] their expenses run beyond any budgeting allowances
sw3336A-ms98-a-0015 70.419000 72.315375 we've quit [laughter]
sw3336A-ms98-a-0016 72.315375 84.393000 [silence]
sw3336A-ms98-a-0017 84.393000 85.734750 yeah
sw3336A-ms98-a-0018 85.734750 97.195250 [silence]
sw3336A-ms98-a-0019 97.195250 102.034750 okay i see i stopped those four years ago yeah
sw3336A-ms98-a-0020 102.034750 103.290500 [silence]
sw3336A-ms98-a-0021 103.290500 113.417125 yeah oh yeah now we are you know um well we're at a point in life that we're looking to retirement rather than you know earnings
sw3336A-ms98-a-0022 113.417125 125.841500 so it's gotten to the point where um yeah au[tomatic]- automatic teller i only had the card and it was on my own personal account and it got way out of control very fast
sw3336A-ms98-a-0023 125.841500 129.368000 so i have a tendency now i take an allowance
sw3336A-ms98-a-0024 129.368000 137.339375 and when it's gone it's gone you know i'm finished if it's gone the fifteenth of the month then it's gone
sw3336A-ms98-a-0025 137.339375 143.117500 and uh we have a tendency not to use cash we pay everything by check
sw3336A-ms98-a-0026 143.117500 151.165250 and so that way w[e]- we keep control of what we're spending where it's going what it's going for
sw3336A-ms98-a-0027 151.165250 161.367500 so um you know it i take a hundred dollars a month that's all i take and you know i mean i don't buy groceries out of i[t]- it's my own little
sw3336A-ms98-a-0028 161.367500 170.635875 slush fund if you wanna call it that and that's for my little incidentals or running to the grocery store to get a you know gallon of milk or whatever
sw3336A-ms98-a-0029 170.635875 174.764875 but um after that it's check only
sw3336A-ms98-a-0030 174.764875 181.058625 so we can you know really know where our money's going and you know what's happening
sw3336A-ms98-a-0031 181.058625 184.078125 what about how are you on charge cards
sw3336A-ms98-a-0032 184.078125 185.341125 [silence]

sw3336A-ms98-a-0034 186.799125 201.400000 [silence]
sw3336A-ms98-a-0035 201.400000 202.650875 yes
sw3336A-ms98-a-0036 202.650875 219.571250 [silence]
sw3336A-ms98-a-0037 219.571250 220.947125 okay_1
sw3336A-ms98-a-0038 220.947125 239.762750 [silence]
sw3336A-ms98-a-0039 239.762750 240.940125 well
sw3336A-ms98-a-0040 240.940125 247.880875 [silence]
sw3336A-ms98-a-0041 247.880875 253.800500 okay yeah well this might help you because_1 see my husband travels as well
sw3336A-ms98-a-0042 253.800500 256.418250 and we have separate charge accounts
sw3336A-ms98-a-0043 256.418250 261.298750 he's got an American Express and that's only traveling
sw3336A-ms98-a-0044 261.298750 265.263250 then we both have a Visa or MasterCard
sw3336A-ms98-a-0045 265.263250 269.743875 so anything on his American Express is his 
sw3336A-ms98-a-0046 269.743875 275.855125 and it's his expense now he gave me one and if i go with him on work
sw3336A-ms98-a-0047 275.855125 280.286625 i only charge on that card i don't put it on my MasterCard
sw3336A-ms98-a-0048 280.286625 291.282000 so we've separated those two completely and i know what you mean because_1 at first we used to intermingle our funds and we weren't sure [noise] why our bills were outrageous
sw3336A-ms98-a-0049 291.282000 298.946000 you know because his traveling expenses were you know i mean he's a traveling salesman so we're looking at six fi[ve]-
