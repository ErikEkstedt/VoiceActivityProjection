sw3354A-ms98-a-0007 21.887875 27.765375 comes back in the yard so you don't have anyone do your yard you do it yourself yeah we do too
sw3354A-ms98-a-0008 27.765375 41.288875 [laughter-isn't] [laughter-that] [laughter-the] [laughter-truth] all flyer's on every door [laughter-everyday] [laughter-that's] [laughter-right] well we um we my husband does the same thing he does the yard and he wants me to learn how to work the lawn mower but i keep putting off learning
sw3354A-ms98-a-0009 41.288875 52.177000 that's right but i had recently gone out and planted mums so we had decided to paint the front of the house about three weeks ago and so while my husband was painting i went out and bought about fifty dollars worth of mums over at Calloway's
sw3354A-ms98-a-0010 52.177000 59.344250 and put out yellow and bronze and they just gorgeous and so then last week my mom comes in town and she says well those are gonna die just the first frost
sw3354A-ms98-a-0011 59.344250 71.095875 she said you should have done pansies and i went well now you tell me [laughter] so that first night that on Halloween we went out and covered them_1 with a sheet and they did okay that first night but the second night we were at the movies and didn't do it so i guess i've lost them_1
sw3354A-ms98-a-0012 71.095875 74.119625 i haven't gone out to check [laughter-yet]
sw3354A-ms98-a-0013 74.119625 86.877750 oh listen but um the worst problem we've had here with this grass was about the third year we were here i guess it was about four years ago and we did not know in August to put down the uh whatever it is for grub worms
sw3354A-ms98-a-0014 86.877750 95.732875 and the next spring i guess in that March every time we would go out and just try to walk on the grass or reach down to pull a weed we'd have big whole patches come up have you ever seen it
sw3354A-ms98-a-0015 95.732875 106.726375 what grub worms do and we pulled up almost half of our yard just by raking it it would just come off in the rake down to the dirt so we had to go out and {resod} the whole thing with squares
sw3354A-ms98-a-0016 106.726375 116.501000 and wet it and put it down and rope it off everything it took a lot of money and a lot of time so the most careful thing we do on our yard every August is put down [laughter-that] Diazanon
sw3354A-ms98-a-0017 116.501000 118.565750 [silence]
sw3354A-ms98-a-0018 118.565750 120.535750 oh yeah we found them_1
sw3354A-ms98-a-0019 120.535750 128.664250 yeah we found them_1 we dug under there about an inch and you could see them_1 they're real fat old white things and they said they turn into black bugs in the spring
sw3354A-ms98-a-0020 128.664250 132.152875 yeah but in but in the wh[ole]- um-hum
sw3354A-ms98-a-0021 132.152875 141.305375 yeah June bugs is what i'd heard them_1 called so anyhow occasionally i find them_1 in the flower beds they said that every yard has some but it was a preponderance of them_1 that caused our problem
sw3354A-ms98-a-0022 141.305375 147.227875 so that's the number one thing we do whether we fertilize or anything else just because_1 we got burned so badly before
sw3354A-ms98-a-0023 147.227875 150.444375 [silence]

sw3354A-ms98-a-0035 194.074625 203.231625 variegated uh things died so we pretty much go with that dwarf yaupon and that yaupon holly and they just live yeah you can you can stand those

sw3354A-ms98-a-0040 213.793625 220.752375 same way um-hum that that they warned me of that one finally and i said you know you need to either read Neil Sperry's book before you shop or get a reputable nursery 
sw3354A-ms98-a-0041 220.752375 232.586250 because a lot of places that would are just trying to sell whatever was pretty out there and we didn't know the difference and every year we learn one more thing we didn't know before like about these [laughter-mums] [laughter-it's] [laughter-like] okay next year [laughter] i'll do pansies [laughter] 
sw3354A-ms98-a-0042 232.586250 242.950875 yes and my backyard we had it really nice and then my husband wanted a Labrador puppy and so it was about i guess he's three now so the first summer he was here he dug up all of my
sw3354A-ms98-a-0043 242.950875 254.646625 bushes and plants and brought them to the front door [laughter-and] [laughter-the] [laughter-back] [laughter-door] [laughter-and] [laughter-laid] [laughter-them] [laughter-on] [laughter-the] [laughter-patio] so it's like our backyard is just kind of like as long as he won't damage it fine and if he'll if there's anything he'll hurt we just don't put it out there anymore
