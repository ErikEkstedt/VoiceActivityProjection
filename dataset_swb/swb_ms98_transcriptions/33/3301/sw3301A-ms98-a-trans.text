sw3301A-ms98-a-0009 46.432625 54.074625 yeah i'm it's really scary because_1 i you know i i had a conversa[tion]- or i heard it over a conversation that they had with Gorbachev on the news
sw3301A-ms98-a-0010 54.074625 59.456250 stating that he needs to get you know like a United States set up over there because they're not gonna make the winter
sw3301A-ms98-a-0011 59.456250 62.391750 without the food and the electricity
sw3301A-ms98-a-0012 62.391750 72.141500 and if they d[on't]- if if people don't have food and electricity they're gonna go after it somehow and they're and they're gonna fight it out instead of doing it calmly like he's trying to have done now
sw3301A-ms98-a-0013 72.141500 76.663375 um i went over to the Soviet Union uh about three years ago
sw3301A-ms98-a-0014 76.663375 83.049875 and it was very sad [laughter] they i[t]- the economy over there is very poor um
sw3301A-ms98-a-0015 83.049875 87.472125 oh yeah and when we went over there we were not allowed you know off this bus
sw3301A-ms98-a-0016 87.472125 96.180875 or you know into the you know onto the streets or anything like that well when i went i did [laughter-anyway] and i got out [noise] and um
sw3301A-ms98-a-0017 96.180875 101.493375 um you know [laughter-yeah] [laughter-i] [laughter-know] [laughter-it] we barely got back but um
sw3301A-ms98-a-0018 101.493375 106.122500 we went into the black market where kids our age were you know i'm twenty three
sw3301A-ms98-a-0019 106.122500 115.705250 and we went down there and these kids wanted anything that was made that was American Lee jeans your coats your shoes anything that you brought with you and they'd give you things
sw3301A-ms98-a-0020 115.705250 129.099375 because they wanted these clothes and they looked just like we did because they would ask for these clothes and stuff so after you came out it was very sad people were in the real drab clothing and whenever you bought something you'd have to go through four or five lines to get it
sw3301A-ms98-a-0021 129.099375 133.995875 and it was you know really sad to see that but um
sw3301A-ms98-a-0022 133.995875 140.771625 yeah it it's something else over there everything's breaking down when we the motel we stayed in you know you could only stay in American hotels
sw3301A-ms98-a-0023 140.771625 142.286750 and uh
sw3301A-ms98-a-0024 142.286750 151.869625 um the we didn't have water for four days and when we did get it it looked like apple juice it was awful and and you know to see how they live over there

sw3301A-ms98-a-0026 152.961625 157.960000 right [laughter] and it was just real sad to see it that way
sw3301A-ms98-a-0027 157.960000 166.656125 but um you know like our tour guide was a sixteen year old girl um she was married and living with her parents and you know they live in the apartment buildings around there
sw3301A-ms98-a-0028 166.656125 169.235500 and because she got the job because she could speak English
sw3301A-ms98-a-0029 169.235500 182.757250 so she got to be a tour guide and it was really bizarre because um she couldn't shave her legs or anything and they couldn't get razors and so um she asked for us to go into the American shop and buy her razors so that she could do that
sw3301A-ms98-a-0030 182.757250 186.330250 and it was just something else to see
