sw3335A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 4.247125 [noise] yeah i had this topic uh the last time i called i believe
sw3335A-ms98-a-0002 4.247125 8.410625 well do you have any uh children or are you in college
sw3335A-ms98-a-0003 8.410625 13.647500 [silence]

sw3335A-ms98-a-0005 16.513500 18.650375 [silence]
sw3335A-ms98-a-0006 18.650375 22.536625 certainly and where did your uh children go to college
sw3335A-ms98-a-0007 22.536625 34.689750 [silence]
sw3335A-ms98-a-0008 34.689750 36.591500 well that's great
sw3335A-ms98-a-0009 36.591500 41.523250 [silence]
sw3335A-ms98-a-0010 41.523250 43.095625 i see
sw3335A-ms98-a-0011 43.095625 46.368750 [silence]
sw3335A-ms98-a-0012 46.368750 50.131125 well that's great i'm the director of admissions at UTD
sw3335A-ms98-a-0013 50.131125 52.122375 [silence]
sw3335A-ms98-a-0014 52.122375 60.899125 [laughter] well what advice did you give them when they were choosing their colleges it looks like they uh you have a variety there
sw3335A-ms98-a-0015 60.899125 64.666625 [silence]
sw3335A-ms98-a-0016 64.666625 66.099000 well
sw3335A-ms98-a-0017 66.099000 71.961250 [silence]
sw3335A-ms98-a-0018 71.961250 73.242500 [laughter]
sw3335A-ms98-a-0019 73.242500 77.368375 [silence]
sw3335A-ms98-a-0020 77.368375 90.474750 well you're going right down my list uh the first thing that i always talk to students about is the academic program because if we don't have what you're looking for it isn't gonna do you any good no matter how bad you wanna come here
sw3335A-ms98-a-0021 90.474750 101.335625 and uh cost is always uh usually next on the list especially for the parents and uh financial assistance and scholarships
sw3335A-ms98-a-0022 101.335625 114.706250 and usually then we talk a little bit about uh the size of the school and uh different types of organizations and activities that they can get involved in and of course distance from home and size of classes and
sw3335A-ms98-a-0023 114.706250 120.209125 um it sounds like uh from your experience you know how to go right down the list with them
sw3335A-ms98-a-0024 120.209125 140.258625 [silence]
sw3335A-ms98-a-0025 140.258625 149.340125 yeah you you know it's interesting especially when uh uh my experience uh has always been at a public university
sw3335A-ms98-a-0026 149.340125 161.030250 and uh a lot of the students in that home town uh sometimes shun the idea of staying and going to school across the street so to speak
sw3335A-ms98-a-0027 161.030250 170.786750 but uh it always seems like at the beginning of the year they're talking about well i'm going to this state and i'm getting out of here and i'm going way over there
sw3335A-ms98-a-0028 170.786750 185.107000 and a lot of times when it gets right down to the practical aspect of it they end up staying pretty darn close to home because they can save money as far as housing and uh laundry [laughter]
sw3335A-ms98-a-0029 185.107000 187.158375 [silence]
sw3335A-ms98-a-0030 187.158375 191.138250 you bet [laughter] [laughter-it] [laughter-sure] [laughter-does]
sw3335A-ms98-a-0031 191.138250 204.143125 [silence]
sw3335A-ms98-a-0032 204.143125 205.766500 sure
sw3335A-ms98-a-0033 205.766500 207.192375 [noise]
sw3335A-ms98-a-0034 207.192375 220.727375 [laughter] well there's a little barrier around the washing machine and the dryer and uh for some reason men just can't get around that barrier [laughter]
sw3335A-ms98-a-0035 220.727375 223.571500 [silence]
sw3335A-ms98-a-0036 223.571500 230.073125 uh i have a daughter that's a seventh grader and then i have a son that's a sophomore at uh Shepton High School
sw3335A-ms98-a-0037 230.073125 240.105875 and so it's uh it's been interesting watching them uh sign up for appropriate course work and things and they're they're on the college bound track at least
sw3335A-ms98-a-0038 240.105875 252.759250 [silence]
sw3335A-ms98-a-0039 252.759250 262.971250 well uh they certainly have two different personalities but uh in terms of needs the older son is interested in the medical field
sw3335A-ms98-a-0040 262.971250 271.164125 and uh at this particular point you know taking appropriate course work but really nothing uh that's in out of the ordinary
sw3335A-ms98-a-0041 271.164125 277.457625 and uh the daughter has indicated that uh she wants to get a degree in uh
sw3335A-ms98-a-0042 277.457625 287.847000 business um and then go on to become President [laughter] sure [noise] you bet and
sw3335A-ms98-a-0043 287.847000 298.850000 well i uh you know we're we we try to be conscious of uh of the uh equal uh equal rights and uh [vocalized-noise]
