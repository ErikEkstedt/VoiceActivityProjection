sw3372B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.052250 [noise] go ahead
sw3372B-ms98-a-0002 1.052250 32.602750 [silence]
sw3372B-ms98-a-0003 32.602750 34.887875 do you work for TI
sw3372B-ms98-a-0004 34.887875 36.583250 oh
sw3372B-ms98-a-0005 36.583250 38.040250 [silence]
sw3372B-ms98-a-0006 38.040250 50.828250 oh okay oh all right well see we have the testing already here we've had it for oh about_1 five years it used to just be for new employees
sw3372B-ms98-a-0007 50.828250 62.911000 and now it's for all employees they uh randomly select employee numbers and uh the day that they select you is when you have to go and and be tested so we're familiar with it
sw3372B-ms98-a-0008 62.911000 68.486750 uh we have a lot of um people upset about it at the beginning some not all
sw3372B-ms98-a-0009 68.486750 77.137625 but what was happening at TI is that they found certain parts of the company there was a lot of drug abuse um
sw3372B-ms98-a-0010 77.137625 89.446625 mainly the areas where where they were doing a lot of um manufacturing type things and what they ended up doing is um kind of like doing a little bit of an undercover agent
sw3372B-ms98-a-0011 89.446625 98.285500 to watch what was happening and we had people using on the premises and actually selling and dealing you know on the premises
sw3372B-ms98-a-0012 98.285500 110.989500 [laughter] well yeah i[t]- it was you know combination of of uh both activities and uh and using too so they developed this uh drug policy so that
sw3372B-ms98-a-0013 110.989500 122.902500 uh to eliminate there's some parts of the company that we do uh government contracts and i think some of those require the drug testing but now TI thought well we'll just do it for all employees
sw3372B-ms98-a-0014 122.902500 133.567125 that um not just because of safety issues but because we want a totally drug free safe environment for all people to work in and that we shouldn't have um
sw3372B-ms98-a-0015 133.567125 138.148500 people on drugs within our you know offices and such
sw3372B-ms98-a-0016 138.148500 143.381125 i haven't personally ever been tested but i don't have a problem with it
sw3372B-ms98-a-0017 143.381125 150.329000 [silence]
sw3372B-ms98-a-0018 150.329000 163.183000 no but one thing that to to me was um going on stretching it a little too far was that they also check um if you're taking somebody else's prescription drug
sw3372B-ms98-a-0019 163.183000 175.658875 you know it happens a lot of times like some member of the family gets the flu or whatever and you know then they give it to everybody else in the family and don't always go back to the you know doctor and get another prescription
sw3372B-ms98-a-0020 175.658875 182.022125 well according to what they do at TI if you take a prescription drug it has to be in your name
sw3372B-ms98-a-0021 182.022125 193.215125 it you know it can't be in your spouse's name so they will look i mean the testing will look for i guess any kind of drugs and you have to tell them_1 what you're taking a prescription for
sw3372B-ms98-a-0022 193.215125 195.598500 [silence]
sw3372B-ms98-a-0023 195.598500 201.870625 right yes yes when you get tested you're supposed to tell them you know everything that that the might be there 
sw3372B-ms98-a-0024 201.870625 211.295875 and then if they ever um question you or something you may have to show proof that you do have a prescription in your name
sw3372B-ms98-a-0025 211.295875 222.299750 [silence]
sw3372B-ms98-a-0026 222.299750 230.149500 well what they were be testing for are the ones that would have like you know barbiturates or codeine things like that in them
sw3372B-ms98-a-0027 230.149500 233.091625 [silence]
sw3372B-ms98-a-0028 233.091625 243.554750 right right i guess that's what i[s]- they wouldn't be looking for penicillin and an[tibiotics]- antibiotics and stuff they'd be looking for the yeah controlled things barbiturates amphetamines
sw3372B-ms98-a-0029 243.554750 247.075500 [silence]
sw3372B-ms98-a-0030 247.075500 248.531500 right
sw3372B-ms98-a-0031 248.531500 254.989750 right you pretty much you know put down what you remember even if it is was just Contact or something like that
sw3372B-ms98-a-0032 254.989750 265.092750 but afterwards uh maybe if you had a controlled substance [laughter] [laughter-well] [laughter-you] you probably put down you know you had Drixoral or Contact if you would remember that you did it 
sw3372B-ms98-a-0033 265.092750 277.178375 [laughter-no] [laughter-i'm] [laughter-just] [laughter-saying] you probably pro[bably]- put down on the sheet anything you have taken but if they had a controlled substance maybe they would ask you then to show that you had that prescription in your name 
sw3372B-ms98-a-0034 277.178375 290.374750 i know i had one contract employee through manpower was not a TI person but was it contract person and they test them too even if you are not a real uh TIer if you are a contract employee here they test you too
sw3372B-ms98-a-0035 290.374750 298.626000 and he had taken some kind of um oh you know uh just he had some kind of flu or something he got a real bad migraine and he took his mother's
