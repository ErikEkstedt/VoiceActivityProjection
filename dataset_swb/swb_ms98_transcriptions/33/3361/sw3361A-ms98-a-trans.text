sw3361A-ms98-a-0005 5.635250 9.636625 one of the main things i'd like like to know is uh
sw3361A-ms98-a-0006 9.636625 21.128000 how do you feel about the knowing about the environment of a nursing home before you would send someone there to live and so forth what do you think would be required and so forth
sw3361A-ms98-a-0007 21.128000 36.944375 [silence]
sw3361A-ms98-a-0008 36.944375 41.501875 oh you knew of the homes then you knew of the homes themselves
sw3361A-ms98-a-0009 41.501875 44.469500 [silence]
sw3361A-ms98-a-0010 44.469500 45.796500 uh-huh
sw3361A-ms98-a-0011 45.796500 47.292750 [silence]

sw3361A-ms98-a-0013 48.986000 70.145375 [silence]
sw3361A-ms98-a-0014 70.145375 71.577375 yeah
sw3361A-ms98-a-0015 71.577375 73.500000 [silence]
sw3361A-ms98-a-0016 73.500000 86.969125 well from your point of view how would you feel about actually sending someone that that's you know means something to you to one of those homes i realize that you indicated you wanted to check out as much as you can about it and of course that makes sense but
sw3361A-ms98-a-0017 86.969125 96.067375 how do you think they would feel i should say about moving from where they have lived most of their life into a whole new new home situation
sw3361A-ms98-a-0018 96.067375 101.070250 [silence]
sw3361A-ms98-a-0019 101.070250 102.125250 uh-huh
sw3361A-ms98-a-0020 102.125250 103.815750 oh okay
sw3361A-ms98-a-0021 103.815750 109.518000 [silence]
sw3361A-ms98-a-0022 109.518000 110.812750 uh-huh
sw3361A-ms98-a-0023 110.812750 112.081750 [silence]
sw3361A-ms98-a-0024 112.081750 113.512750 yes
sw3361A-ms98-a-0025 113.512750 122.273625 [silence]
sw3361A-ms98-a-0026 122.273625 123.321625 uh-huh
sw3361A-ms98-a-0027 123.321625 132.085750 [silence]
sw3361A-ms98-a-0028 132.085750 145.188000 well how do you find that your your personal relationship is with her know that you're both together all the time and you are having to do a lot more for her than normal does that does that cause any problems between the two of you
sw3361A-ms98-a-0029 145.188000 147.745250 [silence]
sw3361A-ms98-a-0030 147.745250 149.836125 uh-huh is she
sw3361A-ms98-a-0031 149.836125 159.594625 [silence]
sw3361A-ms98-a-0032 159.594625 163.859625 it's hard to accept the fact that you're unable to pursue life
sw3361A-ms98-a-0033 163.859625 166.629250 [noise] at the level that you did before isn't it
sw3361A-ms98-a-0034 166.629250 168.040750 [silence]
sw3361A-ms98-a-0035 168.040750 169.365000 yeah
sw3361A-ms98-a-0036 169.365000 176.400000 [silence]
sw3361A-ms98-a-0037 176.400000 183.443375 it is different i had that almost similar situation my mother lives in an apartment with my sister
sw3361A-ms98-a-0038 183.443375 185.181375 and uh
sw3361A-ms98-a-0039 185.181375 191.097500 so i except for the three or four months this summer that's the only time i ever spent with my mother and
sw3361A-ms98-a-0040 191.097500 205.591125 of course since i see her only once or twice a year i was just thrilled to have her here with me and i spent every minute i could to be with her and uh cooking foods for her you know just to make her her life as though she were on vacation
sw3361A-ms98-a-0041 205.591125 212.106625 but somehow another it that doesn't work between my mom and my sister and they they find they they are
sw3361A-ms98-a-0042 212.106625 224.002500 in speaking they i don't know my mother feels uncomfortable around my sister and my sister's uncomfortable because her mother's there [laughter] and i guess it's just because they're there all the time
sw3361A-ms98-a-0043 224.002500 228.411125 so it's it puts has put pressure on both of them from that point of view
sw3361A-ms98-a-0044 228.411125 236.607875 so that's that's kind of bad news and by the same token my wife's mother is now moved into a nursing home
sw3361A-ms98-a-0045 236.607875 250.244250 and after all she has been a farmer's wife for sixty years and now all of a sudden she's had to move off of her farm into another home where the environment is totally different
sw3361A-ms98-a-0046 250.244250 261.583625 she's relatively happy but she doesn't like the food and when she [laughter-complains] about the food then everybody gets angry with her so that's another one of those things you have to solve
sw3361A-ms98-a-0047 261.583625 262.896750 [laughter]
sw3361A-ms98-a-0048 262.896750 270.463875 [silence]
sw3361A-ms98-a-0049 270.463875 275.704000 yeah after all their their life is so totally different because in those early days
sw3361A-ms98-a-0050 275.704000 286.909625 the food they had to make it from scratch so to speak i mean you raised your own chickens and you killed your own hogs i suppose and then they they had to store the meat in uh
sw3361A-ms98-a-0051 286.909625 293.429125 i don't want to say barns but they had regular little places they they would hang it you know to cure it and so forth and
sw3361A-ms98-a-0052 293.429125 298.651500 and now all of a sudden it uh comes in differently it [laughter-tastes] differently 
sw3361A-ms98-a-0053 298.651500 299.906000 [laughter]
