sw3359A-ms98-a-0046 245.030375 256.756500 i don't know but uh yeah well there isn't isn't too much in the way of restaurants that i don't like things that are kind of oddball like uh Thai cuisine i i never been
sw3359A-ms98-a-0047 256.756500 270.724125 really fond of that stuff you talk about spicy that'll that'll literally blow your head off it's so hot [vocalized-noise] and i can handle just about any kind of food without uh um
sw3359A-ms98-a-0048 270.724125 278.658500 well but that that stuff is goes one notch beyond uh my tolerances so
sw3359A-ms98-a-0049 278.658500 291.571000 although i guess on this topic i [vocalized-noise] talk about the uh service in a restaurant is always nice though too that's one thing what's that yeah
sw3359A-ms98-a-0050 291.571000 299.522000 well i find that lately that so many people are working you know they're working waitressing jobs or waiter
