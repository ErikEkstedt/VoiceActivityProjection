sw3387B-ms98-a-0030 143.878500 153.246375 and be registered with what they ever con[tribute]- contribute but they should not have a one-on-one relationship with the people making the decisions that affect them

sw3387B-ms98-a-0039 179.249000 183.113125 i- i think to bring it in line
sw3387B-ms98-a-0040 183.113125 197.363250 you're going to have to have a generation that's going to really bite the bullet to bring it in line you can't ease into it it took years and years to build up the momentum that's there now
sw3387B-ms98-a-0041 197.363250 206.467125 uh i- i- i forget the figures on the interest rate but it's something like uh hundreds of thousands of dollars a second
sw3387B-ms98-a-0042 206.467125 217.147625 in interest part of the problem is we don't loan from ourselves we we buy from intimate international banking that's why we have interest
sw3387B-ms98-a-0043 217.147625 223.732750 and and i- i r[eally]- i really feel that that that is part of the problem
sw3387B-ms98-a-0044 223.732750 230.387125 that we we've let things get so out of control that that we don't wanna put the brakes on them
