sw3330B-ms98-a-0002 2.493000 12.802875 [silence]
sw3330B-ms98-a-0003 12.802875 14.145250 um-hum
sw3330B-ms98-a-0004 14.145250 16.630250 [silence]
sw3330B-ms98-a-0005 16.630250 18.925750 well i uh [noise]
sw3330B-ms98-a-0006 18.925750 25.576250 one girl went in in state and has graduated and then uh that was um
sw3330B-ms98-a-0007 25.576250 33.046375 you know that was her choice pretty much where she wanted to go and i have uh one out of two out of state both in Missouri
sw3330B-ms98-a-0008 33.046375 40.547625 and um i teach uh in a college and so i had they had heard me talk about it and for years that
sw3330B-ms98-a-0009 40.547625 44.743000 i didn't think it really made too much difference where they went for their undergraduate
sw3330B-ms98-a-0010 44.743000 46.332500 uh
sw3330B-ms98-a-0011 46.332500 50.083500 so that was pretty much uh
sw3330B-ms98-a-0012 50.083500 58.243625 [silence]
sw3330B-ms98-a-0013 58.243625 69.488000 oh they if they if they're content there but i mean as far as the education and as far as looking at the degree at the end that uh to it's very little difference is paid to it where you get that bachelor's
sw3330B-ms98-a-0014 69.488000 75.439750 uh if it's a halfway decent school they should be happy naturally and if they can get uh
sw3330B-ms98-a-0015 75.439750 78.492250 um two out of let's see 
sw3330B-ms98-a-0016 78.492250 86.971875 my son got a full total uh scholarships and so there's uh there's plenty of scholarships out there and so people should be advised to
sw3330B-ms98-a-0017 86.971875 89.981000 to look for those and um
sw3330B-ms98-a-0018 89.981000 96.027375 [silence]
sw3330B-ms98-a-0019 96.027375 97.863750 uh
sw3330B-ms98-a-0020 97.863750 99.392750 [silence]
sw3330B-ms98-a-0021 99.392750 110.705625 well they uh i went we went around my son was a graduated from a Jesuit high school and so he he was pretty much looking for a Jesuit university and so there were you know that was limited to
sw3330B-ms98-a-0022 110.705625 115.836625 uh five or six different places and um so he's in Saint Louis U and i
sw3330B-ms98-a-0023 115.836625 121.530375 guess i played a role in that i- i just sort of uh let them um
sw3330B-ms98-a-0024 121.530375 129.307375 you know they'd all been uh pretty uh [noise] efficient as far as studies an[d]- and uh
sw3330B-ms98-a-0025 129.307375 137.491000 so i didn't have that much to do they just uh they just knew they wanted to go to college and and i you know helped them_1 uh
sw3330B-ms98-a-0026 137.491000 138.675875 [silence]
sw3330B-ms98-a-0027 138.675875 147.982500 uh get there as far as uh traveling with them_1 to look at different places we did do that and i would suggest a person always goes and looks at the school before they sign up
sw3330B-ms98-a-0028 147.982500 151.359250 some people don't do it and then they get there and
sw3330B-ms98-a-0029 151.359250 154.639125 hate it or or whatever so
sw3330B-ms98-a-0030 154.639125 156.493625 if it's possible
sw3330B-ms98-a-0031 156.493625 158.047750 [silence]
sw3330B-ms98-a-0032 158.047750 159.478875 right
sw3330B-ms98-a-0033 159.478875 160.622000 [vocalized-noise]
sw3330B-ms98-a-0034 160.622000 170.482125 i think in the short run it is expensive in the long run it's very uh reasonable if the person my daughter that's been in in Missouri uh for a
sw3330B-ms98-a-0035 170.482125 173.365750 a second year now she's coming home at the end of the semester
sw3330B-ms98-a-0036 173.365750 174.480000 [silence]
sw3330B-ms98-a-0037 174.480000 187.478750 so uh you know she's already twenty one she started late so that's you know strictly up to her and uh she'll finish down here um um finish this year down here and then decide what she's gonna do next year
sw3330B-ms98-a-0038 187.478750 192.427625 it'll save me a lot of money because_1 i'm not going to have to pay out of state tuition but again that's her decision
sw3330B-ms98-a-0039 192.427625 201.727250 so uh but i have so many students in my classes that have dropped out and come back and they're much better students at twenty five twenty six may[be]- twenty eight
sw3330B-ms98-a-0040 201.727250 208.647625 so you know i don't i never have pushed them i just say that education is important you should do it
sw3330B-ms98-a-0041 208.647625 212.245875 uh but uh they have to do the work
sw3330B-ms98-a-0042 212.245875 213.250125 [silence]
sw3330B-ms98-a-0043 213.250125 214.749875 so uh
sw3330B-ms98-a-0044 214.749875 219.124875 [silence]
sw3330B-ms98-a-0045 219.124875 220.491750 right
sw3330B-ms98-a-0046 220.491750 224.638750 [silence]
sw3330B-ms98-a-0047 224.638750 226.000750 yeah
sw3330B-ms98-a-0048 226.000750 227.701375 [silence]
sw3330B-ms98-a-0049 227.701375 229.462375 oh i think so
sw3330B-ms98-a-0050 229.462375 232.237125 [silence]
sw3330B-ms98-a-0051 232.237125 242.914250 and also i'm opposed to the to the size does they've just gotten so huge and so my daughter first looked at a place that was forty thousand see that's just too many
sw3330B-ms98-a-0052 242.914250 249.743750 ended up going to where i used to go and that was twenty five hundred when i went there it's twenty one thousand now it's too big
sw3330B-ms98-a-0053 249.743750 251.780250 so uh
sw3330B-ms98-a-0054 251.780250 255.391375 pardon it's Southwest Missouri State University
sw3330B-ms98-a-0055 255.391375 260.832500 and um it was twenty five hundred when i went there forty years ago and uh
sw3330B-ms98-a-0056 260.832500 271.297750 my son is in a school about seven thousand and that's that's not bad i teach in a school about eight thousand and that's that's even a little large but it's much [laughter-better] than twenty one thousand
sw3330B-ms98-a-0057 271.297750 279.870250 [noise] but they do have to visit and and if if the parent can point out all the different places to look for for scholarships and then
sw3330B-ms98-a-0058 279.870250 286.103500 oh those rating uh the magazines and all those things are doing the ratings now and everything i don't
sw3330B-ms98-a-0059 286.103500 292.024500 think it hurts to look at them i don't put that much stock in them but probably fine just to compare
sw3330B-ms98-a-0060 292.024500 293.076000 [silence]
sw3330B-ms98-a-0061 293.076000 298.466000 [noise] right and uh if they you know uh they need to
