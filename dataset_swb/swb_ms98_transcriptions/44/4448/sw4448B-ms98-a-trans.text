sw4448B-ms98-a-0003 4.865750 14.565500 i have done uh a variety of fishing probably the most favorite uh was when i was of youth
sw4448B-ms98-a-0004 14.565500 21.625125 um probably in the ages ten to fifteen when i went out with my dad uh we lived in
sw4448B-ms98-a-0005 21.625125 26.603625 we lived on the uh southeast coast of Florida about a mile from the ocean we went out
sw4448B-ms98-a-0006 26.603625 29.452875 off the coast of Fort Lauderdale Miami
sw4448B-ms98-a-0007 29.452875 34.157375 in uh small boat with a small outboard motor
sw4448B-ms98-a-0008 34.157375 38.450500 went out a mile two miles three miles sometimes and bottom fished
sw4448B-ms98-a-0009 38.450500 41.265625 and uh [noise]
sw4448B-ms98-a-0010 41.265625 45.889250 and got lots of fish very rapidly basically went out to a reef and uh
sw4448B-ms98-a-0011 45.889250 47.356250 which probably about
sw4448B-ms98-a-0012 47.356250 48.429500 [silence]
sw4448B-ms98-a-0013 48.429500 51.800625 oh ten fathoms or something like that and uh
sw4448B-ms98-a-0014 51.800625 57.691875 and we just pull up fish usually pull up fish as fast as you could let your line down
sw4448B-ms98-a-0015 57.691875 65.089000 and sometimes uh had some fun uh with trigger fish that would follow other fish up and then
sw4448B-ms98-a-0016 65.089000 67.696875 then you'd catch the trigger fish right at the surface
sw4448B-ms98-a-0017 67.696875 73.530625 occasional shark or an occasional octopus things of that nature but
sw4448B-ms98-a-0018 73.530625 75.907875 [silence]
sw4448B-ms98-a-0019 75.907875 80.291625 yeah well that was pretty rare you know but every once in a while you'd get something like that
