sw4467B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.488125 [noise]
sw4467B-ms98-a-0002 0.488125 2.265375 [silence]
sw4467B-ms98-a-0003 2.265375 4.749500 well i think that uh
sw4467B-ms98-a-0004 4.749500 6.503375 [silence]
sw4467B-ms98-a-0005 6.503375 8.035625 i guess i ju[st]-
sw4467B-ms98-a-0006 8.035625 14.875625 everybody knows that education is is important but i guess the main thing is there's some things you just don't care about
sw4467B-ms98-a-0007 14.875625 18.114375 so if you don't care about them_1 you don't vote for them_1 right
sw4467B-ms98-a-0008 18.114375 21.683875 [silence]
sw4467B-ms98-a-0009 21.683875 29.188125 yeah although although uh that's there's a lot of people out there that'll do that for you that
sw4467B-ms98-a-0010 29.188125 41.785500 i just thought of something now that that made a big difference to me and uh come to think of it it's got to do with Jerry Brown and that's when i was in i used to live in California and when he was Secretary of State there
sw4467B-ms98-a-0011 41.785500 48.124500 one of the things that he did was he sent out a booklet and the booklet was
sw4467B-ms98-a-0012 48.124500 61.406750 uh here are the issues here's the pros here's the cons here's the pro rebuttal to the cons and here's the con rebuttal to the pros by the time i got through reading that article by the time i got through reading that booklet i knew exactly what the issues were
sw4467B-ms98-a-0013 61.406750 63.371625 [silence]
sw4467B-ms98-a-0014 63.371625 66.843875 well we had a little booklet and it says here's the issues
sw4467B-ms98-a-0015 66.843875 70.927875 [silence]
sw4467B-ms98-a-0016 70.927875 80.576375 but for fifty bucks you can or whatever it is fifty or three hundred or five hundred or something like that you can put in a statement for or against
sw4467B-ms98-a-0017 80.576375 83.800125 but the nice thing about this other thing was that
sw4467B-ms98-a-0018 83.800125 84.958875 and
sw4467B-ms98-a-0019 84.958875 88.036250 was that you have uh
sw4467B-ms98-a-0020 88.036250 101.391875 like i say you have the people say well it's going to uh it's gonna reduce taxes and the other people say yeah it'll reduce taxes but at the expense of something else and so it was how shall i say it it was kind of focused pros and the cons and then the rebuttal
sw4467B-ms98-a-0021 101.391875 106.434875 a[nd]- so i got to see both sides whereas in the current booklet it just says here's
sw4467B-ms98-a-0022 106.434875 112.264500 uh if somebody thinks it's a good idea he tells me but you know it's are you uh are you involved in software
sw4467B-ms98-a-0023 112.264500 113.458125 [silence]
sw4467B-ms98-a-0024 113.458125 117.124875 are you an engineer or or involved in software at all
sw4467B-ms98-a-0025 117.124875 118.143500 [silence]
sw4467B-ms98-a-0026 118.143500 125.584500 okay well one of the things about a lot of programs is they tell you what they do but they don't tell you what they don't do
sw4467B-ms98-a-0027 125.584500 138.562625 and the only way you know what i mean they say oh look this is great this this s[lices]- slices bread but they don't tell you that [noise] that it also mashes it at the same time and uh so that
sw4467B-ms98-a-0028 138.562625 140.733000 [silence]
sw4467B-ms98-a-0029 140.733000 142.301250 yeah
sw4467B-ms98-a-0030 142.301250 146.993875 [silence]
sw4467B-ms98-a-0031 146.993875 150.840500 well out here they do it by uh mail you can do it by mail that
sw4467B-ms98-a-0032 150.840500 163.244125 [silence]
sw4467B-ms98-a-0033 163.244125 165.570000 well the problem with that i think is fraud
sw4467B-ms98-a-0034 165.570000 168.955500 we haven't been around voter fraud uh too much but
sw4467B-ms98-a-0035 168.955500 185.139375 [silence]
sw4467B-ms98-a-0036 185.139375 199.365750 or the other option i guess is to i mean why do you even have to do it over the phone why couldn't you just walk up to the booth and and uh register right there and then they have with uh everything hooked up by the computer you could say okay you've already voted
sw4467B-ms98-a-0037 199.365750 227.558875 [silence]
sw4467B-ms98-a-0038 227.558875 231.028500 [laughter] [laughter-that's] that's certainly true too
sw4467B-ms98-a-0039 231.028500 235.822875 there's uh the other side of the coin is that uh in the educational side
sw4467B-ms98-a-0040 235.822875 244.577000 the IRS does a wonderful job right about now at putting articles in the paper about uh motiva[ting]- motivating people to turn in their taxes
sw4467B-ms98-a-0041 244.577000 247.403250 uh and i don't think the
sw4467B-ms98-a-0042 247.403250 252.094625 that very many people try to motivate you to to vote
sw4467B-ms98-a-0043 252.094625 253.116625 [silence]
sw4467B-ms98-a-0044 253.116625 254.344375 uh
sw4467B-ms98-a-0045 254.344375 270.910625 [silence]
sw4467B-ms98-a-0046 270.910625 272.773625 oh i see what you're saying
sw4467B-ms98-a-0047 272.773625 298.722000 [silence]
