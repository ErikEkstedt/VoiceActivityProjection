sw4467A-ms98-a-0022 158.462375 164.540625 if you can do it from the phone and pick it up at anytime twenty four hours a day and do it that's that'll make

sw4467A-ms98-a-0027 177.759625 185.964750 you know in terms of verifying who they are and what they're saying and and uh you know people could uh use that you know

sw4467A-ms98-a-0031 204.736750 216.850500 i don't know i think um that or you can also the problem is also oh motivating people to do it seeing that their voting has an impact on the process and people frankly don't see
sw4467A-ms98-a-0032 216.850500 228.331125 any connection with what they they vote and what happens so they very frustrated and they don't do anything so there's learned helplessness type of you know no matter what i do it's not gonna help so why bother
sw4467A-ms98-a-0033 228.331125 229.678625 um

sw4467A-ms98-a-0037 252.379500 259.104375 um-hum well they sh[ould]- i you know what i think also they should do is build in the process the election process
sw4467A-ms98-a-0038 259.104375 271.777250 is not just vote getting i mean to get those pe[ople]- candidates saying that not that their votes aren't any good unless they also motivate so many percent of the populace to vote they could be identified by them
sw4467A-ms98-a-0039 271.777250 272.810125 [silence]
sw4467A-ms98-a-0040 272.810125 280.254000 so put it in the political process that that you know not only you have to get petitions in order to get on the ballot
sw4467A-ms98-a-0041 280.254000 288.361875 but you have to attract you know you have to attract so many people just to come to vote they don't have to vote for you but they have to come to the polls and actually vote
sw4467A-ms98-a-0042 288.361875 298.722000 you know those something built in to the system to motivate people to to bring them into the process and especially the people who wanna hold office i mean that's what
