sw4497B-ms98-a-0017 111.738375 122.971875 and there there there's minimal because they you know they bought it um they've kind of bought into the whole system and there's there's care given for the lawn and stuff
sw4497B-ms98-a-0018 122.971875 134.140875 and um as they get older more care can be given and there's some minimal fees that they'll always be paying but the basic fee for health care and all that is already taken care of
