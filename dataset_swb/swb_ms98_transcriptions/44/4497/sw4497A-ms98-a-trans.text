sw4497A-ms98-a-0002 0.977625 11.168750 well all right um i- i guess i'll start um by mentioning that um being twenty four years old i had a great-grandmother
sw4497A-ms98-a-0003 11.168750 18.589000 who's still alive at this point who was just recently placed in a nursing home after the death of my great-grandfather
sw4497A-ms98-a-0004 18.589000 25.815500 and it was a real problem [noise] in doing that because uh she has Alzheimer's
sw4497A-ms98-a-0005 25.815500 35.459500 and uh she had no wish or desire to go into that kind of facility and uh we were very concerned about uh
sw4497A-ms98-a-0006 35.459500 45.000875 her long-term care my great-grandfather after he was found out he was going to go into a nursing home uh actually gave up the ghost more or less
sw4497A-ms98-a-0007 45.000875 49.083250 and passed on o[nly]- only about a week after that
sw4497A-ms98-a-0008 49.083250 116.312375 [silence]
sw4497A-ms98-a-0009 116.312375 118.141750 um-hum
sw4497A-ms98-a-0010 118.141750 119.630875 [noise]
sw4497A-ms98-a-0011 119.630875 138.902500 [silence]
sw4497A-ms98-a-0012 138.902500 140.382500 yeah we[ll]-
sw4497A-ms98-a-0013 140.382500 142.600375 [noise] we had
sw4497A-ms98-a-0014 142.600375 154.327250 yeah we had up here when they got into uh when my grandmother came over my great-grandmother came over here she actually spent sometime with us and we had to have a nurse come in
sw4497A-ms98-a-0015 154.327250 167.864250 because we simply we couldn't handle it she kind of she'd lost all bearings as to where she was and she would actually wander around uh we were afraid she would wander herself into the basement and fall down the stairs or
sw4497A-ms98-a-0016 167.864250 179.154000 uh you know it was incredible because my great-grandfather had taken care of her and she demanded absolute twenty four hour care she had to be watched she had to be cleaned
sw4497A-ms98-a-0017 179.154000 186.859250 everything you know it was a demeaning process for my for my grandfa[ther]- great-grandfather we had never realized how much
sw4497A-ms98-a-0018 186.859250 198.986000 um how bad she had deteriorated over the uh years i mean i she would forget my name and she would forget you know how to cook or how to take care of herself but we didn't realize the extent
sw4497A-ms98-a-0019 198.986000 202.183375 until after my great-grandfather had a bad stroke
sw4497A-ms98-a-0020 202.183375 210.448625 and um um [vocalized-noise] we had her here and we had to take care of her and it even kind of drove the nurse a little [laughter-crazy]
sw4497A-ms98-a-0021 210.448625 211.955125 [silence]
sw4497A-ms98-a-0022 211.955125 213.322000 [noise]
sw4497A-ms98-a-0023 213.322000 221.093000 [silence]
sw4497A-ms98-a-0024 221.093000 222.550750 yeah

sw4497A-ms98-a-0028 251.951500 262.987375 yeah my my great-grandfather my great-grandfather had found uh my great-grandfather w[as]- w[as]- was around during the depression so he had actually hidden a lot of money in the house over there
sw4497A-ms98-a-0029 262.987375 268.258250 and of course you know the moment you go into a nursing home situation they take everything
sw4497A-ms98-a-0030 268.258250 275.763750 and and it was it was terrible and very demeaning he didn't wanna lose the independence and
sw4497A-ms98-a-0031 275.763750 285.297875 uh that was the biggest problem because we didn't really catch it as early as you seem to have as far as you know planning you know of long-term
sw4497A-ms98-a-0032 285.297875 295.992625 [silence]
