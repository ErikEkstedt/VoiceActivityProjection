sw4440A-ms98-a-0021 128.941750 134.075750 Saturdays is a is it's difficult to get everybody
sw4440A-ms98-a-0022 134.075750 142.537125 organized and rounded up uh so they get the chores done and don't home in on the television immediately when they when they get up
sw4440A-ms98-a-0023 142.537125 146.412250 um actually and during the school nights uh
sw4440A-ms98-a-0024 146.412250 153.371375 uh the we have a rule now that that uh because the kids are so easily distracted by the you know
sw4440A-ms98-a-0025 153.371375 160.195750 uh [noise] that uh no television on school nights and no [noise]

sw4440A-ms98-a-0029 167.495250 174.349375 uh well no it's not that hard to enforce it's just uh because if there's you know if it's
sw4440A-ms98-a-0030 174.349375 175.848625 i found out that if
sw4440A-ms98-a-0031 175.848625 177.472000 if uh
sw4440A-ms98-a-0032 177.472000 180.447000 if i let one of them watch pretty soon they'd all be watching
sw4440A-ms98-a-0033 180.447000 182.587250 so i so i said that
sw4440A-ms98-a-0034 182.587250 184.480750 [laughter]
sw4440A-ms98-a-0035 184.480750 193.995875 well no television and no ball games and the reason no ball games is because the kids'll stick their earphones on and and listen to ball games and try and do their piano believe it or not
sw4440A-ms98-a-0036 193.995875 197.283375 [silence]

sw4440A-ms98-a-0047 224.015625 227.986250 well now that's kind of that's interesting to me because
sw4440A-ms98-a-0048 227.986250 236.816625 a lot of uh you know in keeping on the uh the family thing here the reason that's interesting is because i've noticed that some families have
sw4440A-ms98-a-0049 236.816625 238.152500 um
sw4440A-ms98-a-0050 238.152500 241.939875 like the the parent i knew some ham and uh
sw4440A-ms98-a-0051 241.939875 243.348500 uh
sw4440A-ms98-a-0052 243.348500 252.135125 there's a tendency and i- i think a lot of it depends on the family for like the ham to go in his in his uh room and shut the door
sw4440A-ms98-a-0053 252.135125 255.502250 in a shack and shut the door and the rest of the family was excluded
sw4440A-ms98-a-0054 255.502250 257.763000 [silence]
sw4440A-ms98-a-0055 257.763000 258.915625 and that's
sw4440A-ms98-a-0056 258.915625 259.998625 [silence]
sw4440A-ms98-a-0057 259.998625 265.752875 and the fact that and i read one time that uh there was a high divorce rate in in uh
sw4440A-ms98-a-0058 265.752875 273.006000 Cape Canaveral down there or Cape Kennedy or whatever you call it because the engineer would come home go in his study close the door and that was it
sw4440A-ms98-a-0059 273.006000 282.802750 and uh just sort of an autocrat so the fact that you've got three participants in your family that uh that do that is that's a credit to you what a[re]-
sw4440A-ms98-a-0060 282.802750 287.124000 let's say i- i guess my other question about uh
sw4440A-ms98-a-0061 287.124000 288.483000 um [noise]
sw4440A-ms98-a-0062 288.483000 289.542750 [silence]
sw4440A-ms98-a-0063 289.542750 292.503750 when it comes to when they're on their own
