sw4445B-ms98-a-0002 2.811375 13.477375 well we have the the usual automotive pollution that and although it's not very visible you don't worry about that uh too much uh but uh
sw4445B-ms98-a-0003 13.477375 15.457250 we have a lot of wood smoke
sw4445B-ms98-a-0004 15.457250 24.974000 uh here now i heat with wood so ah and i'm one of the polluters if you think that wood smoke is a is a s[ource]- a source of pollution but there are people in this community who
sw4445B-ms98-a-0005 24.974000 26.630750 who think that uh
sw4445B-ms98-a-0006 26.630750 32.115625 it's gone beyond the part of being part of the charm of the community to the point of being part of the pollution
sw4445B-ms98-a-0007 32.115625 33.433375 [noise] and
sw4445B-ms98-a-0008 33.433375 34.462625 [silence]
sw4445B-ms98-a-0009 34.462625 38.840000 and uh we're very close to the uh to the Grand Canyon
sw4445B-ms98-a-0010 38.840000 41.738125 where air pollution is a very big issue
sw4445B-ms98-a-0011 41.738125 56.012875 because on of pollution well it's debatable as to whether it's coming from the Los Angeles area on the jet stream or whether it's coming from the Four Corners power plant up near Page Arizona uh
sw4445B-ms98-a-0012 56.012875 69.375750 but because it's a national park that's a a big issue there uh [noise] here in Flagstaff actually uh it it's something that's unique to us the the biggest pollutant that we have in our air is cinder dust
sw4445B-ms98-a-0013 69.375750 73.793750 and that's because uh we're in a volcanic region
sw4445B-ms98-a-0014 73.793750 83.730500 and we uh we have dirt roads uh in a lot of areas that are covered with with cinders but what they also cinders on the highways in the winter time
sw4445B-ms98-a-0015 83.730500 98.211750 in place of uh using salt or substances like that that they might in the eastern part of the country and when the snow goes away and it dries up and the cars drive over it we get a lot of cinder dust kicked up into the air and as of
sw4445B-ms98-a-0016 98.211750 104.351250 you know the lar[gest]- the largest quantity that's the biggest pollutants that we have t[o]- to deal with here

sw4445B-ms98-a-0026 161.909375 163.163250 sure

sw4445B-ms98-a-0030 173.524375 185.514500 i laugh because i made the journey once from El Paso to Dallas and then continuing east uh to the Eastern Coast of the United States and uh i joked that uh all of the settlers
sw4445B-ms98-a-0031 185.514500 197.703250 settled in Eastern Texas where the green rolling hills are and and when they finally beat the Mexicans the Mexicans said fine you can have East Texas but as l[ong]- as long only as long as you take west Texas too [laughter]

sw4445B-ms98-a-0046 242.601875 256.148625 here in Flagstaff uh juniper is the the very distinctive smelling wood that you can smell in the wood smoke uh and one of the issues here ah it which gets into forest management but has an impact on on air pollution
sw4445B-ms98-a-0047 256.148625 261.992875 is that uh we're surrounded by the largest stand of ponderosa pine in the world
sw4445B-ms98-a-0048 261.992875 270.599000 but people don't wanna burn ponderosa pine they wanna burn oak which is very hard to find in this region or juniper because it's the more plentiful hardwood
sw4445B-ms98-a-0049 270.599000 278.246750 and uh aspen uh it burns very cleanly but doesn't put out a lot of heat uh and and ponderosa
sw4445B-ms98-a-0050 278.246750 284.841625 we also have pinon but uh it uh it it like ponderosa is very dirty
sw4445B-ms98-a-0051 284.841625 291.377750 and so they're not preferable woods and so here we have this great abundance of ponderosa pine
sw4445B-ms98-a-0052 291.377750 298.946000 and the forest service is real[ly]- saying we really wish that we could find a way to make it uh less of a
