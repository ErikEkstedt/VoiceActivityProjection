sw4445A-ms98-a-0015 103.934750 115.536250 yeah well i i'm sure that cinder dust is pretty unique [laughter] um in the Dallas area of course the the biggest issue of air pollution is just automobiles
sw4445A-ms98-a-0016 115.536250 127.008000 uh we don't have much in the way of heavy industry i mean this is a center for electronics and banking and insurance and you know businesses like that
sw4445A-ms98-a-0017 127.008000 130.236500 which are not typically bad polluters [laughter]
sw4445A-ms98-a-0018 130.236500 132.197500 but um
sw4445A-ms98-a-0019 132.197500 136.139750 so i i'd think you'd have to blame most of it on the automobiles here
sw4445A-ms98-a-0020 136.139750 147.938500 [silence]
sw4445A-ms98-a-0021 147.938500 151.898000 we have we yes we occasionally have them not if they're not
sw4445A-ms98-a-0022 151.898000 154.166000 n[ot]- not too significant
sw4445A-ms98-a-0023 154.166000 162.222000 but they do occ[asionally]- occasionally occur uh one source of [laughter-pollution] for us is the dust and sand in uh west Texas
sw4445A-ms98-a-0024 162.222000 167.151250 in the spring time we'll have parts of Lubbock coming to Dallas
sw4445A-ms98-a-0025 167.151250 171.230500 i'm serious these enormous clouds
sw4445A-ms98-a-0026 171.230500 174.212125 of sand or dust or whatever you wanna call it
sw4445A-ms98-a-0027 174.212125 177.487375 [silence]

sw4445A-ms98-a-0032 195.783750 198.235750 [laughter-okay]
sw4445A-ms98-a-0033 198.235750 204.526625 [noise] all right i can understand that it's interesting though that you mentioned the uh wood stoves
sw4445A-ms98-a-0034 204.526625 214.602750 i grew up in New Mexico and but that was long enough ago that uh people didn't really heat that much with wood that was sort of a backward way of doing things if you will
sw4445A-ms98-a-0035 214.602750 221.582250 uh but now in New Mexico heating with with particularly pinon pine is really an issue
sw4445A-ms98-a-0036 221.582250 226.897750 not only from the pollution point of view but it takes many many years to grow those trees
sw4445A-ms98-a-0037 226.897750 228.067500 [silence]
sw4445A-ms98-a-0038 228.067500 232.244375 and people are chopping them down and heating their houses with them um
sw4445A-ms98-a-0039 232.244375 237.161000 and it's it's such a distinctive smell when it burns i had forgotten it i mean i [laughter]
sw4445A-ms98-a-0040 237.161000 243.084000 it it's one of those smells you forget but then when you step outside your mother's house you go [oop/oops] yep somebody's burning [laughter-pinon]
sw4445A-ms98-a-0041 243.084000 248.416000 [silence]
