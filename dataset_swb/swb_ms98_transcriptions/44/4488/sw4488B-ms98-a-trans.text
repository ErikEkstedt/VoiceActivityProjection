sw4488B-ms98-a-0002 0.390375 2.485875 [silence]
sw4488B-ms98-a-0003 2.485875 13.344125 where do i stand well if uh if ten means absolutely no control i don't think i'd buy that but i guess i'd be maybe a six
sw4488B-ms98-a-0004 13.344125 19.886500 i think that we probably should have a right to own guns if we're responsible
sw4488B-ms98-a-0005 19.886500 21.424125 uh
sw4488B-ms98-a-0006 21.424125 26.230125 i myself own one i shoot nothing but paper targets
sw4488B-ms98-a-0007 26.230125 31.197375 but i don't think anybody has the right to tell me i can't possess one i don't think
sw4488B-ms98-a-0008 31.197375 34.598000 uh if i'm responsible my kids can't get a hold of them
sw4488B-ms98-a-0009 34.598000 42.988625 and i certainly wouldn't use them for a crime i think the people who do use them_1 for crime aren't the people who bother to get a a license
sw4488B-ms98-a-0010 42.988625 45.010000 uh what are your feelings
sw4488B-ms98-a-0011 45.010000 55.485875 [silence]
sw4488B-ms98-a-0012 55.485875 58.060250 yeah i i[t]- it is a uh
sw4488B-ms98-a-0013 58.060250 61.297000 just picking it out of a hat um
sw4488B-ms98-a-0014 61.297000 64.752625 but do you feel that no one should be able to own any
sw4488B-ms98-a-0015 64.752625 106.545125 [silence]
sw4488B-ms98-a-0016 106.545125 111.969875 okay well i don't know what the laws are in your state uh in order to get a license
sw4488B-ms98-a-0017 111.969875 118.446500 i was uh thoroughly checked out it took over seven months to get myself approved
sw4488B-ms98-a-0018 118.446500 126.411000 um you need all kinds of references you nee[d]- they check your criminal [laughter-record] and all this other stuff uh they restrict
sw4488B-ms98-a-0019 126.411000 133.465500 um when you can carry it you can just take it to a range and back home again if you want to hunt you need a special hunting license
sw4488B-ms98-a-0020 133.465500 145.172875 um i myself am no fool i didn't want to hurt myself why would [laughter-anybody] want to take a chance it is a dangerous thing i took a uh National Rifle Association course on
sw4488B-ms98-a-0021 145.172875 151.359250 how to uh handle one i keep it locked i keep the bullets somewhere else
sw4488B-ms98-a-0022 151.359250 162.196250 um i personally feel that if someone came into my house i'd be too much of a nervous wreck to shoot them accurately and i wouldn't want to hit my kids in case they were wandering around so i really have no
sw4488B-ms98-a-0023 162.196250 170.943625 no thought to use it for protection i you know i'm m[ore]- more of the notion that a bad guy is meaner than i am and would use it against me
sw4488B-ms98-a-0024 170.943625 179.662000 um i think the guns that are out there hurting people are held by irresponsible people um i don't believe that there should be
sw4488B-ms98-a-0025 179.662000 186.611875 that you should be able to walk into your local [laughter-supermarket] and buy one i mean any bozo [laughter-could] get one then and then it would be indeed scary
sw4488B-ms98-a-0026 186.611875 188.140000 [silence]
sw4488B-ms98-a-0027 188.140000 189.001125 uh
sw4488B-ms98-a-0028 189.001125 190.235625 [silence]
sw4488B-ms98-a-0029 190.235625 199.284250 i you know i just like the sport of shooting at a target it's the ki[nd]- it's sort of like weight lifting it's something that you can judge yourself against yourself
sw4488B-ms98-a-0030 199.284250 201.121500 and uh
sw4488B-ms98-a-0031 201.121500 211.383125 i- i- i agree that the thought of actually putting a bullet into flesh is really [laughter-revolting] i mean i personally can't even see hunting you know i have no use for Bambi [laughter-there]
sw4488B-ms98-a-0032 211.383125 213.458875 [silence]
sw4488B-ms98-a-0033 213.458875 221.892750 right but i mean w[e]- we get hamburger in a package and then we end up we forget it came from an animal but i choose to forget i'm a hypocrite [laughter-myself]
sw4488B-ms98-a-0034 221.892750 222.724500 [silence]
sw4488B-ms98-a-0035 222.724500 223.709375 uh
sw4488B-ms98-a-0036 223.709375 231.093375 what what would you think of the notion of you know just taking up a gun for target practice if you were trained d[oes]- does that revolt you in any way
sw4488B-ms98-a-0037 231.093375 235.149000 [silence]
sw4488B-ms98-a-0038 235.149000 236.246625 uh-huh

sw4488B-ms98-a-0041 258.858125 260.819125 then it's too late
sw4488B-ms98-a-0042 260.819125 265.264875 [silence]
sw4488B-ms98-a-0043 265.264875 268.619125 well you know i[t]- i think it's i[t]- i[t]- i think
sw4488B-ms98-a-0044 268.619125 280.583875 uh you talk to someone else they say yeah i think everybody should have a g[un]- i should have a gun and [laughter-nobody] [laughter-else] [laughter-should] because i know i would [laughter-act] [laughter-responsibly] but you you never know about the other guy and i think that's part of the reason why people a[re]- are so fearful
sw4488B-ms98-a-0045 280.583875 283.858375 because it's true someone might get drunk and not think
sw4488B-ms98-a-0046 283.858375 285.463750 um
sw4488B-ms98-a-0047 285.463750 290.492000 you know i don't believe in no laws i think that would be a scary kind of thing
sw4488B-ms98-a-0048 290.492000 293.469125 but well that's how i feel
