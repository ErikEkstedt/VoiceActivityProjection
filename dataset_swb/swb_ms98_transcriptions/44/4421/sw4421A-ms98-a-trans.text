sw4421A-ms98-a-0024 61.600375 71.378250 it was um it was a great uh thing and and i know some other people that who've that have um come back from that and joined the Peace Corps and
sw4421A-ms98-a-0025 71.378250 82.529625 you know went on uh contributing and and like i say in every case uh they benefited and i'm they have lifelong happy memories about about uh
sw4421A-ms98-a-0026 82.529625 94.141000 the things that they did now does that mean that everybody is going to have happy memories well [noise] i don't know but in Europe an[d]- in many states in Europe they do the same thing they they want everybody to to uh 
sw4421A-ms98-a-0027 94.141000 100.237750 not necessarily join the mil[itary]- military but have you know mandatory uh [noise]
sw4421A-ms98-a-0028 100.237750 102.746875 volunteer service of some kind
sw4421A-ms98-a-0029 102.746875 103.883375 [silence]

sw4421A-ms98-a-0036 186.523750 193.058125 yeah well well that's part of the how shall i say it that's part of the experience i think because not every
sw4421A-ms98-a-0037 193.058125 195.537500 [noise] oh how shall i say it not every uh
sw4421A-ms98-a-0038 195.537500 197.028625 [silence]
sw4421A-ms98-a-0039 197.028625 209.258250 not every place we go has has great weather i uh you know sometimes you come back and and you say um that was an interesting trip [laughter] but i guess what i'm saying is that that
sw4421A-ms98-a-0040 209.258250 214.356750 overall the the benefits of of uh volunteer service
sw4421A-ms98-a-0041 214.356750 221.762750 uh are just infectious they they get you remember the people you helped and it's not all money money money money
sw4421A-ms98-a-0042 221.762750 232.574875 and uh it's really useful to to making you well like i say feel like you contribute i know after i spent my time in the Far East i came back and i said well
sw4421A-ms98-a-0043 232.574875 233.715250 [silence]
sw4421A-ms98-a-0044 233.715250 240.012000 of all the bad things i've done in my life and of all the times i wimped out and haven't done anything at least i've done something
sw4421A-ms98-a-0045 240.012000 241.743875 for that period of time
sw4421A-ms98-a-0046 241.743875 243.758000 [noise] and uh
sw4421A-ms98-a-0047 243.758000 245.701750 you know it's um how shall i say it
sw4421A-ms98-a-0048 245.701750 246.896750 [silence]
sw4421A-ms98-a-0049 246.896750 249.398500 it's not a cure all but uh
sw4421A-ms98-a-0050 249.398500 250.519875 [silence]
sw4421A-ms98-a-0051 250.519875 258.956375 the other thing that i've that i like i say i feel is that there's a a lot of people out there that that just have tons of time and uh
sw4421A-ms98-a-0052 258.956375 265.521750 they don't know what they're going to do with their life and and as you pointed out if they've get out and see if uh uh life from a
sw4421A-ms98-a-0053 265.521750 268.768625 from a different uh perspective
sw4421A-ms98-a-0054 268.768625 272.278250 then uh [noise] they have a better focus 
sw4421A-ms98-a-0055 272.278250 273.585875 [silence]
sw4421A-ms98-a-0056 273.585875 276.148375 a[nd]- and let's see what else
sw4421A-ms98-a-0057 276.148375 280.476750 i- i think the only difficulty is going to be um
sw4421A-ms98-a-0058 280.476750 282.247250 [silence]
sw4421A-ms98-a-0059 282.247250 283.763250 if it becomes
sw4421A-ms98-a-0060 283.763250 291.583000 well i think we'd have to learn a lot from the European uh style uh because i know that in America there's
sw4421A-ms98-a-0061 291.583000 299.522000 sometimes there's a tendency to let everybody do their own thing to the point that that uh it might become
