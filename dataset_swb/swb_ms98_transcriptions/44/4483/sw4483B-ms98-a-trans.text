sw4483B-ms98-a-0054 203.448500 216.773125 but um i don't know that's definitely one thing they could do to make it easier is to just you know have have those garbage people that make how every many make tw[enty]- twenty or thirty bucks an hour have them do a little bit of the sorting
sw4483B-ms98-a-0055 216.773125 221.456000 you know and and maybe come up with a better system make it a little more convenient
