sw4495B-ms98-a-0015 62.886875 72.028250 yeah well i've done a little bit of that too um i guess i've kind of done the full range of camping anywhere from backpacking in the mountains for
sw4495B-ms98-a-0016 72.028250 76.234500 for a week at a time to the the car camping kind of thing 
sw4495B-ms98-a-0017 76.234500 78.587625 [silence]
sw4495B-ms98-a-0018 78.587625 86.298125 well i've done some down in um Tennessee and Kentucky that area North Carolina and then done some in New Mexico
sw4495B-ms98-a-0019 86.298125 89.761750 and some out in Montana Colorado
sw4495B-ms98-a-0020 89.761750 92.867125 so i've kind of gone around and done it number of places
sw4495B-ms98-a-0021 92.867125 94.583750 [silence]
sw4495B-ms98-a-0022 94.583750 96.045625 right
sw4495B-ms98-a-0023 96.045625 107.301375 i used to work at um summer camps um a lot when i was in high school and college and i worked at some summer camps in New Mexico where um
sw4495B-ms98-a-0024 107.301375 111.437250 the emphasis there was on backpacking exclusively
sw4495B-ms98-a-0025 111.437250 114.714000 right um-hum you've been there
sw4495B-ms98-a-0026 114.714000 115.728500 [silence]
sw4495B-ms98-a-0027 115.728500 116.886875 um-hum

sw4495B-ms98-a-0029 119.471875 126.157875 yeah yeah well it's a very popular place and i worked there [noise] three summers so [noise] got to know it pretty well
sw4495B-ms98-a-0030 126.157875 131.357875 [silence]
sw4495B-ms98-a-0031 131.357875 137.508875 well probably the biggest concern that i would have now is getting safe drinking water um
sw4495B-ms98-a-0032 137.508875 150.439875 cause a lot of times we'd just pull water out of a stream and um use that and i was never really big on using a lot of chemicals for water purification and treatment um
sw4495B-ms98-a-0033 150.439875 156.559625 and nowadays i think i'd be a little bit more cautious about that than i used to be
sw4495B-ms98-a-0034 156.559625 170.567125 [silence]
sw4495B-ms98-a-0035 170.567125 172.012375 um-hum

sw4495B-ms98-a-0042 195.575000 200.835000 [silence]
sw4495B-ms98-a-0043 200.835000 207.055000 well i suppose in some of the real big parks and stuff that could be an issue
sw4495B-ms98-a-0044 207.055000 215.602125 but generally i haven't ever found that to be a problem usually people are very friendly and
sw4495B-ms98-a-0045 215.602125 223.125375 um cooperative all the way around so i've never deemed that as a threat to myself but
sw4495B-ms98-a-0046 223.125375 230.086125 been been fairly careful about_1 not leaving tempting things out in the campsite and stuff like that
sw4495B-ms98-a-0047 230.086125 234.545750 [silence]
sw4495B-ms98-a-0048 234.545750 236.036625 um-hum
sw4495B-ms98-a-0049 236.036625 243.404875 right and usually if i'm backpacking of course there i don't worry about it much at all because_1 if
sw4495B-ms98-a-0050 243.404875 250.580000 there's something there that they want [noise] they'd have to haul it out a long ways so they usually would think twice about it
sw4495B-ms98-a-0051 250.580000 252.062250 so
sw4495B-ms98-a-0052 252.062250 256.160750 [silence]

sw4495B-ms98-a-0055 260.760250 267.991625 you know i've had some friends of mine that have made the trip down through there a couple of times they really enjoy it but
sw4495B-ms98-a-0056 267.991625 280.056500 there's something about going down in a hole that [laughter] just um doesn't really relate that strongly to me i suppose i'll try it someday but i always like to climb mountains and get up where i can see something
sw4495B-ms98-a-0057 280.056500 286.415625 [silence]
sw4495B-ms98-a-0058 286.415625 287.811750 um-hum

sw4495B-ms98-a-0060 292.140875 297.314000 well no it's mo[re]- mostly just some rolling hills so there isn't really much
