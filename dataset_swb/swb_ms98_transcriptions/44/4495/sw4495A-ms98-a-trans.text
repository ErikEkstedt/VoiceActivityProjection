sw4495A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 2.639375 [noise] i haven't done any camping lately how about_1 you
sw4495A-ms98-a-0002 2.639375 14.963875 [silence]
sw4495A-ms98-a-0003 14.963875 18.849250 [noise] were these extended trips or just a weekend or
sw4495A-ms98-a-0004 18.849250 23.885375 [silence]
sw4495A-ms98-a-0005 23.885375 34.151250 uh that's about what i've done but it goes back even further to my childhood camping went out camping a[nd]- a[nd]- the purpose was not to camp the purpose was to fish
sw4495A-ms98-a-0006 34.151250 38.547125 and there were no motels in in the wilds of New [laughter-Mexico]
sw4495A-ms98-a-0007 38.547125 48.575625 [noise] so if you wanted to go fish for a few days you would uh and at certain lakes that were definitely off the beaten track you would do what you i think what you call car camping
sw4495A-ms98-a-0008 48.575625 55.207500 i mean the car's there and and you may or may not sleep on a cot outside of it or inside the car or
sw4495A-ms98-a-0009 55.207500 59.901125 but uh nothing too elaborate in the way of tents and
sw4495A-ms98-a-0010 59.901125 63.904750 i've actually even slept on the ground [laughter]
sw4495A-ms98-a-0011 63.904750 75.792125 [silence]
sw4495A-ms98-a-0012 75.792125 78.694375 [noise] where did you do your backpacking
sw4495A-ms98-a-0013 78.694375 92.170000 [silence]
sw4495A-ms98-a-0014 92.170000 96.468750 but this was in years past or yeah
sw4495A-ms98-a-0015 96.468750 109.481375 [silence]
sw4495A-ms98-a-0016 109.481375 113.825250 [vocalized-noise] around Philmont or something [laughter]
sw4495A-ms98-a-0017 113.825250 120.217750 no i haven't no but every Boy Scout i've ever known has camped at [laughter-Philmont]
sw4495A-ms98-a-0018 120.217750 125.633625 [silence]
sw4495A-ms98-a-0019 125.633625 131.488500 yeah i guess i don't know do you think i[t's]- it's as safe as it used to be to go camping [noise]
sw4495A-ms98-a-0020 131.488500 155.972125 [silence]
sw4495A-ms98-a-0021 155.972125 165.991000 yeah when when i was in growing up in New Mexico if we went on a picnic or whatever it was always in the mountains we lived in the southwestern corner of the state so we could go to the mountains or the desert
sw4495A-ms98-a-0022 165.991000 171.135875 just pick a place and if you w[ere]- needed water the you'd find a stream and drink right out of the stream
sw4495A-ms98-a-0023 171.135875 180.327750 when i left New Mexico and moved to Missouri i would not have dreamed [laughter] drinking out of any stream that i saw [laughter-there]
sw4495A-ms98-a-0024 180.327750 184.875000 so i guess partly it depends on on how isolated the river is
sw4495A-ms98-a-0025 184.875000 194.756500 but uh course i- i mean even in in New Mexico you always had the possibility of a cow or uh some other critter upstream a [laughter] ways from you 
sw4495A-ms98-a-0026 194.756500 195.780375 [silence]
sw4495A-ms98-a-0027 195.780375 200.821375 um what about crime in camp sites do you think that's a problem
sw4495A-ms98-a-0028 200.821375 221.310500 [silence]

sw4495A-ms98-a-0031 229.148500 237.197750 oh yeah yeah it you hide your fishing gear and your camera and all that sort of [laughter-stuff] don't tempt people
sw4495A-ms98-a-0032 237.197750 247.832750 [silence]
sw4495A-ms98-a-0033 247.832750 249.421750 [laughter]
