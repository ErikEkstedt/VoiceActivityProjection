sw4400A-ms98-a-0017 82.500625 83.510500 [noise]

sw4400A-ms98-a-0019 84.424875 85.446250 [noise]

sw4400A-ms98-a-0022 94.974625 100.257625 how shall i say it uh everything's electronic uh [noise] uh it's not that i'd
sw4400A-ms98-a-0023 100.257625 112.304750 i mean cancel [laughter-their] [laughter-time] it's just that uh there's so much you know you can't and you can't tune it yourself you can't do anything it's because you don't have the the tools to measure it on on the other hand i'm i- i have a
sw4400A-ms98-a-0024 112.304750 121.764125 a ninety Honda and uh i'm kind of on the other end of the spectrum i have let's see i have uh twelve thousand miles on a little over a two year old car
sw4400A-ms98-a-0025 121.764125 123.293875 and uh
sw4400A-ms98-a-0026 123.293875 125.088250 [noise]
sw4400A-ms98-a-0027 125.088250 132.502000 so yeah and it's a it's a absolutely flawless car it uh and it's the smoothest car i've ever ridden i uh [noise]
sw4400A-ms98-a-0028 132.502000 135.456125 ah [vocalized-noise] what's that
sw4400A-ms98-a-0029 135.456125 144.451125 Accord yes and uh so the the things that personally if i ever if i had to buy another car uh
sw4400A-ms98-a-0030 144.451125 145.605500 [silence]
sw4400A-ms98-a-0031 145.605500 151.927500 huh i'd be [vocalized-noise] the the new American cars uh their ads intrigue me
sw4400A-ms98-a-0032 151.927500 158.051500 because they think they can catch up uh with uh the Japanese but as far as
sw4400A-ms98-a-0033 158.051500 163.675000 i- i think one of the things that they are going to have to impress me with is is again this uh 
sw4400A-ms98-a-0034 163.675000 171.075500 [noise] the thing that impresses you about yours and that's uh frequency of repair and and absolute reliability 
sw4400A-ms98-a-0035 171.075500 178.462375 because the worst thing that can happen to a person is i think is uh to have to go in and get it fixed you know it's it's
sw4400A-ms98-a-0036 178.462375 179.676625 [silence]
sw4400A-ms98-a-0037 179.676625 186.993625 yeah [vocalized-noise] there's a a that that was i- i noticed that uh uh with one of my other cars uh
sw4400A-ms98-a-0038 186.993625 198.802125 if if there's this kind of uh natural curve of decay you know decay curve uh half the time when you take it in it's farther down the and you get it back it's farther down the curve than when you took it in
sw4400A-ms98-a-0039 198.802125 208.412250 because_1 those guys are they're being paid for uh you know last time i had my car re[paired]- uh even even this car i took it in they said sixty dollars an hour and
sw4400A-ms98-a-0040 208.412250 209.375250 and
sw4400A-ms98-a-0041 209.375250 210.845750 [silence]
sw4400A-ms98-a-0042 210.845750 213.252125 [vocalized-noise] well i said sixty dollars an hour
sw4400A-ms98-a-0043 213.252125 215.577875 [silence]
sw4400A-ms98-a-0044 215.577875 223.166875 they charged me a hundred and thirty dollars labor but they clocked my car out at an hour after they clocked it in
sw4400A-ms98-a-0045 223.166875 231.056750 so they they charged me for two and a half you know basically two and a half hours uh labor an hour later and i asked them about that and they said that's uh
sw4400A-ms98-a-0046 231.056750 239.248250 oh that's flat rate sir you know that they look it up in the book and if it takes an hour to do something why and they can get it done in thirty minutes why they charge you an hour
sw4400A-ms98-a-0047 239.248250 242.380250 so anyway those that uh
sw4400A-ms98-a-0048 242.380250 244.808875 [silence]
sw4400A-ms98-a-0049 244.808875 252.951625 yeah so uh anyway what i'm looking for is is reliability because i wanna keep it away from the from the uh the repair people
sw4400A-ms98-a-0050 252.951625 256.143750 and the other thing i'm i guess i'd be looking for is uh
sw4400A-ms98-a-0051 256.143750 257.354000 um
sw4400A-ms98-a-0052 257.354000 262.182875 you know mileage counts with me even though i even though i don't drive that much i i like mileage
sw4400A-ms98-a-0053 262.182875 264.376125 and uh
sw4400A-ms98-a-0054 264.376125 283.429625 [silence]
sw4400A-ms98-a-0055 283.429625 291.061500 [laughter]
