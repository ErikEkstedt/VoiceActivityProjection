sw3717A-ms98-a-0021 53.455875 60.419625 yeah well i tell you i- i work for a credit union so that might be a whole another topic as far as well you know how do
sw3717A-ms98-a-0022 60.419625 68.816125 what's the opinion around there about uh you know credit unions not being taxed and stuff do they do have you guys had any i don't want to say battles but
sw3717A-ms98-a-0023 68.816125 75.750250 do they uh a lot of people around here in Utah and stuff they they claim the un[fair]- un[fair]- uh unfair playing field and whatnot and
sw3717A-ms98-a-0024 75.750250 81.814625 whether or not credit unions are getting you know being treated special and do they get

sw3717A-ms98-a-0030 93.591000 100.325750 it's where they're going to tax credit unions on a state level or or just assess their more for the insurance fund
sw3717A-ms98-a-0031 100.325750 111.128125 huh yeah it's uh i don't know i want i think i've always felt that if we credit unions stick to their little niche they have that then it probably shouldn't be but it seems like more and more uh
sw3717A-ms98-a-0032 111.128125 115.448000 we're getting out into a lot of the bank territories i do not know if it is too fair or not

sw3717A-ms98-a-0043 135.577250 148.341375 yeah they getting into business lending and things like that or yeah i the credit union i work for is one of the top the tw[enty]- uh about the fifteenth largest and we are starting to get into that and that is where i really have my questions as to whether or not we're
sw3717A-ms98-a-0044 148.341375 153.535875 you know if they were able were playing on a level field whereas the banks are getting taxed and stuff
sw3717A-ms98-a-0045 153.535875 162.688125 and i don't know what the corporate taxes are as far as how much they get taxed but i mean i know it would have to it would definitely have to effect our bottom line if we got taxed there's no doubt about it

sw3717A-ms98-a-0054 185.432875 193.161875 well what do you have have you ever studied i guess anything about a flat tax or anything like that i mean we've talked about it and how it kind be kind of a recessive tax for the poor or
sw3717A-ms98-a-0055 193.161875 194.228625 [silence]
sw3717A-ms98-a-0056 194.228625 202.578500 yeah that's true but i mean on more of a national level i guess it seems like it might uh get rid of a lot of the problems as far as the loop holes and stuff but
sw3717A-ms98-a-0057 202.578500 207.936500 maybe just have it based on two or three different level and eliminate a lot of the exemptions and stuff is that
sw3717A-ms98-a-0058 207.936500 210.748375 [silence]

sw3717A-ms98-a-0063 227.450625 231.401125 yeah that's more or less touchy-feely thing as opposed to
sw3717A-ms98-a-0064 231.401125 235.735125 yeah i just always heard that the poor would e[nd]- end up taking the worst brunt of it because they're
sw3717A-ms98-a-0065 235.735125 248.777125 you know their their income is less and yet they're being taxed at the same rate and therefore it hurts their spending power but you know i've heard different ideas to where they will make it so that uh you know depending on your income that it'll be maybe a different level of tax but
sw3717A-ms98-a-0066 248.777125 254.378875 seems like then people would just do whatever they could to hide income so like you say it probably wouldn't do much anyway
