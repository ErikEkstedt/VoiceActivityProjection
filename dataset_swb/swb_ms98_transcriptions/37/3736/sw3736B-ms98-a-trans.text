sw3736B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.665625 [noise] um are you from this area

sw3736B-ms98-a-0003 7.576625 11.381625 well i don't know if you know but Garland has got a real big recycling center
sw3736B-ms98-a-0004 11.381625 19.255875 that in fact we went to yesterday you drive up and you take the stuff out of your trunk and they have different bins for the different materials like
sw3736B-ms98-a-0005 19.255875 27.529750 clear glass and colored glass and plastics and uh they have all the different plastics separated by those little symbols on the bottom
sw3736B-ms98-a-0006 27.529750 38.353375 that's pretty neat my my daughter is four and she's real interested in [laughter-recycling] [laughter] [laughter-so] we're we're trying to promote that because_1 she thought we just put them_1 in a special trash can and threw them_1 away but
sw3736B-ms98-a-0007 38.353375 42.187750 we went to the recycling center to show her what we actually did with them
sw3736B-ms98-a-0008 42.187750 43.214250 [silence]
sw3736B-ms98-a-0009 43.214250 47.489500 uh does Dallas have a curbside recycling program yet
sw3736B-ms98-a-0010 47.489500 50.126375 [silence]
sw3736B-ms98-a-0011 50.126375 51.717500 oh okay
sw3736B-ms98-a-0012 51.717500 55.127750 [silence]
sw3736B-ms98-a-0013 55.127750 56.501500 yeah
sw3736B-ms98-a-0014 56.501500 58.605875 [silence]
sw3736B-ms98-a-0015 58.605875 59.848125 hum
sw3736B-ms98-a-0016 59.848125 61.087750 [silence]
sw3736B-ms98-a-0017 61.087750 69.816250 yeah um like soda bottles are one kin[d]- one type of plastic and milk jugs are one type of plastic you can te[ll]- it's go[t]- it'll
sw3736B-ms98-a-0018 69.816250 76.748375 most of the recyclable containers have a little symbol on the bottom with little with the arrows around it that tells whether it's a one or a two or a three
sw3736B-ms98-a-0019 76.748375 84.994250 it's it's just different kind of plastics like the clear plastic is different from that milky looking plastic know that's what the different types are
sw3736B-ms98-a-0020 84.994250 86.307625 yeah
sw3736B-ms98-a-0021 86.307625 96.073125 yeah yes i i know there's a long scientific name but it's like {polytechnochloride} and all that fun stuff um i like
sw3736B-ms98-a-0022 96.073125 105.909750 i don't know if if they do it all over but our Kroger does a a newspaper recycling every Saturday you can drive up and they have one of the clerks out there no the bag boys out there
sw3736B-ms98-a-0023 105.909750 111.160500 um that will take the papers newspaper out of your car and they'll put it in their little bin
sw3736B-ms98-a-0024 111.160500 116.841500 and they do the recycling i mean they collect the newspapers and their pla[stic]- the plastic grocery bags
sw3736B-ms98-a-0025 116.841500 128.630500 which i think is pretty neat that's something since we all ha[ve]- seem to have an abundance of those plastic grocery bags [laughter] i know we use them for trash can liners and a lot of other things
sw3736B-ms98-a-0026 128.630500 134.636125 [laughter-yeah] yeah in fact i have one today it's um-hum the only problem with those is sometimes they get holes in the bottom
sw3736B-ms98-a-0027 134.636125 139.124500 and [laughter] it's like whoops there goes my chips okay fine
sw3736B-ms98-a-0028 139.124500 143.882625 now i [noise] in fact did you happen to see twenty twenty the other night
sw3736B-ms98-a-0029 143.882625 152.112625 they did a program or the one of their articles was on recycling and or it was actually on a a town that has a dump that
sw3736B-ms98-a-0030 152.112625 158.044125 they charge other cities or towns to come in and dump their trash there they have made so much money from that
sw3736B-ms98-a-0031 158.044125 169.580875 that they built they bought a brand new fire engine and when the fire engine was delivered the fire house wasn't big enough so they [mought/bought] bought a new or built a new one paid for it in cash with the money that they've earned from this landfill
sw3736B-ms98-a-0032 169.580875 179.982500 they have built up one mountain they call it Mount Trashmore they built up one mountain covered it with grass and put ski lifts on it and in the winter they put snow on it and they charge to ski on it
sw3736B-ms98-a-0033 179.982500 188.820750 so the city gets the money from that they built a golf course at the bottom and they get the money from that it's like that's it's a it's Riverview Ohio or some place up there
sw3736B-ms98-a-0034 188.820750 196.850375 but it was i thought it was a pretty neat idea they i mean their city hall looked better it was nicer than Dallas' and they only have fourteen thousand people in the city
sw3736B-ms98-a-0035 196.850375 200.629000 and they like the trash so [laughter-i] [laughter-like] well
sw3736B-ms98-a-0036 200.629000 202.246125 okay [laughter]
sw3736B-ms98-a-0037 202.246125 209.971250 but i thought that was pretty neat it it would be nice if more communities could do that but you have to know from beginning and you have to have the space to do it and 
sw3736B-ms98-a-0038 209.971250 210.974500 [silence]
sw3736B-ms98-a-0039 210.974500 220.268500 yeah see that's well they're already planning a second mountain so they're gonna get going to be called the Twin Peaks i was like uh-huh go back to the TV shows [laughter]
sw3736B-ms98-a-0040 220.268500 224.426000 this it would be nice if more communities could get really involved in recycling
sw3736B-ms98-a-0041 224.426000 229.924500 oh it's we i know like i said i've got a two year old and a four year old and that's
sw3736B-ms98-a-0042 229.924500 239.120750 my daughter thinks that anytime she sees newspapers bundled up they're being recycled [laughter-so] it's like well no honey so that like so that was one reason we went to show her
sw3736B-ms98-a-0043 239.120750 250.419625 what people did with their their stuff when they recycled it and try to explain well yeah you melt down the cans and you make them_1 into new things and you get the paper all wet and you make it into new paper and
sw3736B-ms98-a-0044 250.419625 258.050500 [noise] that's fun trying to explain that to a [laughter-four] [laughter-year] [laughter-old] [laughter] oh so do y'all go ahead and
sw3736B-ms98-a-0045 258.050500 259.069625 [silence]
sw3736B-ms98-a-0046 259.069625 263.410250 well yeah sh[e]- that was the her next question was how do you grow paper
sw3736B-ms98-a-0047 263.410250 269.695125 was like well from trees um that's why you have to cut down trees and why you have to plant more trees
sw3736B-ms98-a-0048 269.695125 270.756375 [silence]
sw3736B-ms98-a-0049 270.756375 278.834375 [laughter-yeah] [laughter-exactly] um well let's see [laughter-um] [laughter] we really don't but and then she was like well what do you do with the glass well
sw3736B-ms98-a-0050 278.834375 289.039375 you crunch it up real small and then you melt it down well what if it breaks well okay [laughter] it it it was an interesting weekend trying to explain all that fun stuff to her
sw3736B-ms98-a-0051 289.039375 298.562000 but at least she knows that that is something that people need to be doing and she got our baby sitter to start recycling her newspapers and cans because that's all she talked about so i guess wha[t]-
