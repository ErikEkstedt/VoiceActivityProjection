sw3748A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.335000 [noise]
sw3748A-ms98-a-0002 0.335000 10.016000 so national health care i don't know about you but for me i am voting for the next democrat for the president uh that says he's going to do something about a national health care program 
sw3748A-ms98-a-0003 10.016000 20.695875 [silence]
sw3748A-ms98-a-0004 20.695875 22.321500 yeah
sw3748A-ms98-a-0005 22.321500 25.485000 yeah i myself uh
sw3748A-ms98-a-0006 25.485000 32.310250 i haven't worked for three years because of some medical problems and uh if i had not had insurance
sw3748A-ms98-a-0007 32.310250 41.982875 with the company i worked with at the time i believe i would have died and that worries me thinking cause i know a lot of people that don't have any coverage at all
sw3748A-ms98-a-0008 41.982875 48.737625 [silence]
sw3748A-ms98-a-0009 48.737625 49.988250 yeah
sw3748A-ms98-a-0010 49.988250 51.013000 [silence]
sw3748A-ms98-a-0011 51.013000 62.951500 well i i think that paying for it on your own it is like in my case i am up to about two hundred thousand dollars worth of health care i don't think that would have been possible for [laughter] the majority of the people in this world
sw3748A-ms98-a-0012 62.951500 70.968625 so but then again there is uh the high cost of medical care is out unreal 
sw3748A-ms98-a-0013 70.968625 96.809750 [silence]
sw3748A-ms98-a-0014 96.809750 98.155500 uh-huh
sw3748A-ms98-a-0015 98.155500 101.990500 [silence]
sw3748A-ms98-a-0016 101.990500 108.478000 well i think somewhere along the line whatever plan they come up with it is going to have to keep the doctors in a high paying field
sw3748A-ms98-a-0017 108.478000 115.735125 uh i myself have a son who hopes to be a doctor in a couple three more years and uh [laughter] he is doing it for the money
sw3748A-ms98-a-0018 115.735125 117.990750 so
sw3748A-ms98-a-0019 117.990750 119.500000 yeah
sw3748A-ms98-a-0020 119.500000 125.498125 but he agrees with me though that there should be something worked out for the people that can't afford it
sw3748A-ms98-a-0021 125.498125 137.984875 [silence]
sw3748A-ms98-a-0022 137.984875 139.404500 right
sw3748A-ms98-a-0023 139.404500 140.991125 [silence]
sw3748A-ms98-a-0024 140.991125 142.209375 yeah
sw3748A-ms98-a-0025 142.209375 152.175625 i found out yeah i uh my mother is on Medicare Medicaid whatever and uh i know it doesn't pay all of her me[dical]- hospital bills and so forth
sw3748A-ms98-a-0026 152.175625 162.455125 and i think it is kind of a shame that at this point in her life she still has to pay quite a bit whenever she is in the hospital several thousand for you know for a weeks stay if she ends up having to pay
sw3748A-ms98-a-0027 162.455125 166.476375 [silence]
sw3748A-ms98-a-0028 166.476375 167.791250 uh-huh
sw3748A-ms98-a-0029 167.791250 170.996125 [silence]
sw3748A-ms98-a-0030 170.996125 180.473750 i know one uh not this Christmas but the Christmas before she was out here and we were out at Smithville which is a little town out east of here and
sw3748A-ms98-a-0031 180.473750 188.273500 we had to take her to the hospital on a Sunday afternoon for a back problem uh fairly minor she just strained it sprained it but
sw3748A-ms98-a-0032 188.273500 196.696000 when the bills starting coming in she had already gone home so i got a chance to look at them and i was shocked i mean i had been through a lot
sw3748A-ms98-a-0033 196.696000 207.961375 i mean with medical bills but when i saw what they did to her that day and it cost about three thousand dollars just to uh get a prescription for some pain pills basically
sw3748A-ms98-a-0034 207.961375 218.970250 [silence]
sw3748A-ms98-a-0035 218.970250 220.173875 yeah
sw3748A-ms98-a-0036 220.173875 221.274375 [silence]
sw3748A-ms98-a-0037 221.274375 223.483375 well that doesn't happen i
sw3748A-ms98-a-0038 223.483375 235.485625 it is weird i was in the hospital for like eight days back in October uh so many mistakes were made during my time there that i uh literally left the hospital in a taxi cab
sw3748A-ms98-a-0039 235.485625 240.956875 just to get away from the place i was scared as to what they were going to do to me next
sw3748A-ms98-a-0040 240.956875 254.961750 and when i got the bill it was outrageous uh pills that i had never heard of that i had taken which i know that i didn't i mean i wasn't ill i was just in for some routine stuff and [laughter] it goes on and on
sw3748A-ms98-a-0041 254.961750 260.478500 [silence]
sw3748A-ms98-a-0042 260.478500 261.997500 yeah
sw3748A-ms98-a-0043 261.997500 265.250500 [silence]
sw3748A-ms98-a-0044 265.250500 266.708000 right
sw3748A-ms98-a-0045 266.708000 276.003500 [silence]
sw3748A-ms98-a-0046 276.003500 288.476625 i think Kerrey is and i think also Jerry Brown from California are interested uh actually the way Bush has been going the last few weeks i think he may be interested uh [laughter] he he seem to be
sw3748A-ms98-a-0047 288.476625 289.493875 [silence]
sw3748A-ms98-a-0048 289.493875 292.290500 [laughter-yeah] uh 
sw3748A-ms98-a-0049 292.290500 298.562000 yeah up until just recently i i would have thought Bush would uh you know i still he has done a pretty good job
