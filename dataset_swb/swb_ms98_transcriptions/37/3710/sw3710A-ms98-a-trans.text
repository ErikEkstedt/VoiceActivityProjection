sw3710A-ms98-a-0033 139.277000 147.012125 you kn[ow]- come to think of it it's that way around here too i mean you know there there's nothing even vaguely resembling hills around here
sw3710A-ms98-a-0034 147.012125 151.834125 which was real confusing when i first moved into this area because_1 i[t]-

sw3710A-ms98-a-0043 176.401250 177.672125 [silence]
sw3710A-ms98-a-0044 177.672125 179.766375 about half of them_1 are
sw3710A-ms98-a-0045 179.766375 181.793125 one bedroom places
sw3710A-ms98-a-0046 181.793125 190.571375 there's a pretty good number of two bedroom places and then there's like uh fifteen or twenty three bedroom places
sw3710A-ms98-a-0047 190.571375 195.964500 but uh oh they're not really too bad they're they're basically cinder block places
sw3710A-ms98-a-0048 195.964500 197.441375 but uh
sw3710A-ms98-a-0049 197.441375 203.698375 [silence]

sw3710A-ms98-a-0052 209.365500 212.469500 wow sounds like fun
sw3710A-ms98-a-0053 212.469500 218.382625 i i've got a ph[ysics]- couple of physics classes facing me this su[mmer]- this summer so

sw3710A-ms98-a-0058 230.491250 234.131875 [noise]

sw3710A-ms98-a-0061 238.878625 248.503375 yeah i remember a a teacher in high school saying that uh he enjoyed physics because_1 it it improved his uh his uh pool game
sw3710A-ms98-a-0062 248.503375 251.620125 uh anyway [laughter]
sw3710A-ms98-a-0063 251.620125 253.108375 yeah

sw3710A-ms98-a-0068 263.067500 267.468875 once we get out of school we're hoping to get into the mountains somewhere
sw3710A-ms98-a-0069 267.468875 270.560250 probably out west um
sw3710A-ms98-a-0070 270.560250 271.627125 [silence]
sw3710A-ms98-a-0071 271.627125 276.524750 yeah more than likely uh the rainy side of the mountains somewhere
sw3710A-ms98-a-0072 276.524750 283.087250 but uh um originally i'm from West Virginia in the Appalachian Mountains
sw3710A-ms98-a-0073 283.087250 297.501000 so uh uh long since fell in love with living in the mountains but it'd probably be like a two story possibly even a three story if we build our own we might even get a little crazy and you know build into the side of a hill
sw3710A-ms98-a-0074 297.501000 298.562000 and do i[t]- the
