sw3700B-ms98-a-0004 12.311000 13.789125 so
sw3700B-ms98-a-0005 13.789125 19.017625 i guess i'd have to say that because we've kind of let this [laughter-house] [laughter-go]
sw3700B-ms98-a-0006 19.017625 25.552000 so we had a shell built and then we did everything else
sw3700B-ms98-a-0007 25.552000 29.349750 so it was quite a bit of work
sw3700B-ms98-a-0008 29.349750 31.228250 what have you done
sw3700B-ms98-a-0009 31.228250 38.204125 [silence]

sw3700B-ms98-a-0017 68.609750 69.751750 [silence]
sw3700B-ms98-a-0018 69.751750 71.760125 but uh
sw3700B-ms98-a-0019 71.760125 75.135875 anyway well have you done anything else
sw3700B-ms98-a-0020 75.135875 80.013375 [silence]
sw3700B-ms98-a-0021 80.013375 82.337875 um-hum um-hum
sw3700B-ms98-a-0022 82.337875 83.407750 [silence]
sw3700B-ms98-a-0023 83.407750 84.675375 yeah
sw3700B-ms98-a-0024 84.675375 93.621750 yeah i you know i'm wondering myself now why i checked this one [laughter-because] my husband is who does all the things like [laughter-what] [laughter-you're] [laughter-talking] [laughter-about]
sw3700B-ms98-a-0025 93.621750 95.267250 i haven't
sw3700B-ms98-a-0026 95.267250 98.023000 done those things and of course
sw3700B-ms98-a-0027 98.023000 100.778750 you know inside stuff
sw3700B-ms98-a-0028 100.778750 102.597500 but um
sw3700B-ms98-a-0029 102.597500 107.816500 now down at the lake we had to like put in floors and put in
sw3700B-ms98-a-0030 107.816500 112.537750 wall and you know do the painting and the
sw3700B-ms98-a-0031 112.537750 116.602000 uh cut and make the like the
sw3700B-ms98-a-0032 116.602000 119.321875 uh window sills and
sw3700B-ms98-a-0033 119.321875 125.104250 things around the door and all that kind of stuff you know so we we did quite a bit
sw3700B-ms98-a-0034 125.104250 130.886625 uh down there that i had never done or we haven't done that much in our own house
sw3700B-ms98-a-0035 130.886625 132.635625 [silence]
sw3700B-ms98-a-0036 132.635625 145.404000 yeah yeah uh we do ha[ve]- still have a problem down there we built us a two story house and the bottom story uh oh it's more like a walk out basement 
sw3700B-ms98-a-0037 145.404000 152.882250 and w[hen]- it was built with these blocks you know these old gray blocks i think they're called Hadite blocks
sw3700B-ms98-a-0038 152.882250 161.622500 and uh we found now with some as much rain as we've had the past year it seeps through
sw3700B-ms98-a-0039 161.622500 166.397500 [laughter-those] [laughter-blocks] and comes into the downstairs
sw3700B-ms98-a-0040 166.397500 170.342250 and uh so now we have bought some uh
sw3700B-ms98-a-0041 170.342250 171.740375 uh
sw3700B-ms98-a-0042 171.740375 174.809500 water proofing paint
sw3700B-ms98-a-0043 174.809500 187.452625 and that's our next project the next time we go down there we've got to paint all those block walls downstairs with this waterproof paint and then hope that maybe that will do it
sw3700B-ms98-a-0044 187.452625 200.731875 but what they should've done i think is they should have put plastic or something like that against the house before they put the dirt back you know when it was built
sw3700B-ms98-a-0045 200.731875 205.341000 and uh they didn't do that didn't think they'd need to [laughter]
sw3700B-ms98-a-0046 205.341000 211.363375 [silence]
sw3700B-ms98-a-0047 211.363375 212.805000 yeah
sw3700B-ms98-a-0048 212.805000 216.864625 [silence]
sw3700B-ms98-a-0049 216.864625 219.502625 oh have you ever used that anywhere
sw3700B-ms98-a-0050 219.502625 220.526375 [silence]
sw3700B-ms98-a-0051 220.526375 224.354875 now people up north that have basements i think
sw3700B-ms98-a-0052 224.354875 225.376250 [silence]
sw3700B-ms98-a-0053 225.376250 230.201125 you and do you know if it if they've had good luck with it
sw3700B-ms98-a-0054 230.201125 238.569875 we had a hard time even finding it down here in fact you know you go in a store and they say oh well that we don't have anything like that you know
sw3700B-ms98-a-0055 238.569875 245.642000 and then finally we found some one somewhere that was familiar with it probably lived in the North 
sw3700B-ms98-a-0056 245.642000 255.739875 and well that's encouraging then because i haven't known that many you know there's just not many basements down here are you from around here
sw3700B-ms98-a-0057 255.739875 261.443625 oh okay well we're from you know Texas too so
sw3700B-ms98-a-0058 261.443625 271.464375 uh but i we have a partner in this deal and he's from the North so he was the one that and it gave us a lot more space you know it gave us double the space
sw3700B-ms98-a-0059 271.464375 282.196750 and toward the lake it looks like a two story house you know because it gradually the back it looks like a one story house you know
sw3700B-ms98-a-0060 282.196750 283.220375 [silence]
sw3700B-ms98-a-0061 283.220375 288.034000 uh-huh built kind of into a hill a little hill you know
sw3700B-ms98-a-0062 288.034000 292.233000 so it was a good idea to give us a lot more space for the money
sw3700B-ms98-a-0063 292.233000 298.045375 we just uh hadn't solved our [laughter] [laughter-water] [laughter-problem] [laughter-yet]
sw3700B-ms98-a-0064 298.045375 300.002000 [vocalized-noise] but we always
