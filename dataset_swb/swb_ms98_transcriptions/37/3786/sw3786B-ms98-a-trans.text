sw3786B-ms98-a-0010 52.195625 57.620125 i'm not sure what the category's supposed to be uh but it was what
sw3786B-ms98-a-0011 57.620125 64.317500 [vocalized-noise] something about what benefits would you consider something like that when you uh go to work for a large company
sw3786B-ms98-a-0012 64.317500 65.876375 uh
sw3786B-ms98-a-0013 65.876375 68.784875 [silence]

sw3786B-ms98-a-0015 73.042250 77.717375 [silence]
sw3786B-ms98-a-0016 77.717375 82.663250 well i'm i thought it said other than salary but yeah
sw3786B-ms98-a-0017 82.663250 83.866875 yeah
sw3786B-ms98-a-0018 83.866875 86.693875 [silence]
sw3786B-ms98-a-0019 86.693875 87.931500 yeah
sw3786B-ms98-a-0020 87.931500 89.064000 [silence]
sw3786B-ms98-a-0021 89.064000 97.049000 well i uh personally i left my previous job which was with Chance-Vought before i joined uh
sw3786B-ms98-a-0022 97.049000 103.437625 there and ironically i left Chance-Vought the largest employer in Dallas County at that time with some
sw3786B-ms98-a-0023 103.437625 115.015375 thirty thousand people as i recall and uh joined a little firm of Texas Instruments because i wanted to go with a small company [laughter]
sw3786B-ms98-a-0024 115.015375 120.183625 and uh that was twenty five hundred people when i joined and uh
sw3786B-ms98-a-0025 120.183625 124.425875 then it became Dallas County's largest employer oh
sw3786B-ms98-a-0026 124.425875 134.997875 but uh one reason i left where i was it definitely had to do with what i wanted uh [vocalized-noise] besides what i was getting and it had to do with uh
sw3786B-ms98-a-0027 134.997875 141.787625 wanting to do research and in other words i wanted to enjoy the job and have the freedom to do the job
sw3786B-ms98-a-0028 141.787625 148.570625 [silence]
sw3786B-ms98-a-0029 148.570625 149.448125 yeah
sw3786B-ms98-a-0030 149.448125 151.084000 [silence]
sw3786B-ms98-a-0031 151.084000 160.451125 well i participated on many uh surveys and that sort of thing i was a TI fellow so i was down on you know on the technical ladder side rather than the uh
sw3786B-ms98-a-0032 160.451125 164.929000 heavy management although i was a branch manager at one time
sw3786B-ms98-a-0033 164.929000 172.912000 and [vocalized-noise] it's amazing that managers in general just would not believe the survey results because to them
sw3786B-ms98-a-0034 172.912000 180.142875 [vocalized-noise] uh money is the motivation and uh benefits you know stock options uh perks that sort of thing
sw3786B-ms98-a-0035 180.142875 191.966125 and power and they they just couldn't understand why with the technical surveys that were done by the uh Institute of Electrical Engineers and uh others
sw3786B-ms98-a-0036 191.966125 204.167750 uh including IBM's that in the technical community salary was never first [laughter] it was usually about third and [noise] yeah
sw3786B-ms98-a-0037 204.167750 205.973000 right
sw3786B-ms98-a-0038 205.973000 213.046000 [silence]
sw3786B-ms98-a-0039 213.046000 223.549750 right number one and number two usually were uh number one was usually uh enjoyable work or work that i enjoy something of that sort
sw3786B-ms98-a-0040 223.549750 233.978000 uh and number two was freedom to do that work normally and uh third or even fourth sometimes was the salary 
sw3786B-ms98-a-0041 233.978000 239.833125 and that was in virtually every technical uh ladder survey that was taken over the
sw3786B-ms98-a-0042 239.833125 251.386500 oh fifteen or so years that i participated but invariably the managers would challenge this you [laughter-know] becau[se]- because_1 they just couldn't believe [laughter-that] that people weren't motivated by money
sw3786B-ms98-a-0043 251.386500 263.449625 [silence]
sw3786B-ms98-a-0044 263.449625 275.284750 yeah well i'm sure you know if you were being paid a slave labor scale obviously money would be high up on the list but
sw3786B-ms98-a-0045 275.284750 288.070000 in a competitive uh market as it was most of the time when i was in where you could g[et]- you could get a job elsewhere anyt[ime]- any day of the week you wanted to go until about the last two years and uh
sw3786B-ms98-a-0046 288.070000 298.466000 in that case you felt more secure uh money wise so that you could seek uh enjoyable work or creative work that sort of thing
