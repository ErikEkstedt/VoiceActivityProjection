sw3742A-ms98-a-0013 58.938625 69.426375 i had the car it's an eighty one Toyota Corona i must've worked on it like every third [laughter-day] i had it [laughter] i had a i had a problem with the uh with the radiator
sw3742A-ms98-a-0014 69.426375 82.149375 uh the car basically would overheat i mean i i l[ived]- used to live in Washington DC and didn't have any problems when i lived up there but soon as i came down here the heat was must must've been too intense for the car so the car kept overheating and turned out it was some kind of a problem with the radiator
sw3742A-ms98-a-0015 82.149375 87.624875 so i had the radiator replaced and they did everything they could possibly do they said there was some kind of problem they just couldn't figure out what it was
sw3742A-ms98-a-0016 87.624875 96.468000 and the Toyota dealer couldn't figure it out the radiator place couldn't figure it out so basically i had to keep adding water to the radiator every uh every couple days
sw3742A-ms98-a-0017 96.468000 106.509875 you know and what you had to do is you had to start it up let it get hot let it suck the radiator fluid into the engine then add more water to it then shut it and then you could run another three days
sw3742A-ms98-a-0018 106.509875 112.705250 oh yeah let me tell you i mean it's it was bad when it was in the winter time you had to do this too you [laughter-know] [laughter]

sw3742A-ms98-a-0027 134.384000 145.725625 they uh it um i think his wife won it in some kind of contest and he just uh it looks almost like a fake car because_1 it's so small it's you know and it's it's in perfect shape
sw3742A-ms98-a-0028 145.725625 151.152625 and uh he just kind of pulls it out every so often cleans it up puts it back [laughter-in] [laughter-the] [laughter-garage]
sw3742A-ms98-a-0029 151.152625 158.130000 [laughter] yeah really but uh it's it's really a neat looking car though and uh

sw3742A-ms98-a-0032 161.730000 163.463500 [silence]
sw3742A-ms98-a-0033 163.463500 167.049875 um-hum um-hum um that's kind of kind of cool
sw3742A-ms98-a-0034 167.049875 175.604750 and the other hobby i have is uh i guess i play uh like the racket sports you know racquetball and tennis and i love to play that
sw3742A-ms98-a-0035 175.604750 177.398375 yeah um-hum
sw3742A-ms98-a-0036 177.398375 180.299500 [silence]
sw3742A-ms98-a-0037 180.299500 181.698375 uh-huh
sw3742A-ms98-a-0038 181.698375 183.150375 um-hum
sw3742A-ms98-a-0039 183.150375 185.623125 [silence]
sw3742A-ms98-a-0040 185.623125 187.068375 uh-huh
sw3742A-ms98-a-0041 187.068375 194.169500 [laughter] well what i did was i played tennis for a long time then hadn't played for a long time then i started [pay/playing] playing racquetball again
sw3742A-ms98-a-0042 194.169500 207.045625 and uh when i got really good at racquetball then i waited a while and i went back to tennis and so now when i'm back to either one of the sports you know since i since the gap was so far apart between the two i think that i get back to tennis soon as i pick up a tennis racket i'm i'm back into the swing
sw3742A-ms98-a-0043 207.045625 215.798250 and soon as i pick up a racquetball racket i'm ba[ck]- it takes me a little while to to get as good you know uh i usually need you know at least a good hour warm-up before i'm i'm back into the swing
sw3742A-ms98-a-0044 215.798250 218.855125 but uh once i'm back in it you know it's pretty good
sw3742A-ms98-a-0045 218.855125 220.756125 [silence]
sw3742A-ms98-a-0046 220.756125 231.193000 oh [laughter] yeah that's definite yeah you don['t]- it i have to really think about the uh the ceiling shots and the side wall shots you know
sw3742A-ms98-a-0047 231.193000 237.206250 uh and that's probably it probably puts more pressure on my brain than it does in my on my [laughter-body] [laughter] 
sw3742A-ms98-a-0048 237.206250 246.845375 it's a great sport see it's aerobic and uh and if you play with someone uh you got to play with someone who's as good as you are you know not better or n[ot]- and not worse
sw3742A-ms98-a-0049 246.845375 258.984375 because_1 if you p[lay]- i used to play with uh my roommate and uh from college and we uh we were both about the same as far as you know how good we both were you know and we'd have volleys that would last five or six minutes you know
sw3742A-ms98-a-0050 258.984375 265.033750 and uh it does i mean we weren't like the best players in the world but we you know we we couldn't get it past each [laughter-other] [laughter-you] [laughter-know] 
sw3742A-ms98-a-0051 265.033750 272.165250 and uh i used to work out to play racquetball three or four times a week and i tell you by the end of the summer i was in perfect shape [laughter-you] [laughter-know]
sw3742A-ms98-a-0052 272.165250 274.855750 so it's it's a great sport great aerobic sport
sw3742A-ms98-a-0053 274.855750 278.938250 [silence]
sw3742A-ms98-a-0054 278.938250 286.709250 [laughter] well the only reason i like it better than tennis is i used to play tennis with my dad and he plays uh old man tennis you know
sw3742A-ms98-a-0055 286.709250 294.211375 he could hit puts underspin on the ball all the time and he can hit every ball okay but he doesn't hit it hard he just hits it really lightly you know makes you run all over the place
sw3742A-ms98-a-0056 294.211375 298.178000 and it just kind of drives me up the [laughter-wall] [laughter]
