sw3793B-ms98-a-0004 2.725000 4.775625 well um
sw3793B-ms98-a-0005 4.775625 16.789625 we've done a lot of tent camping that's probably the closest definition that i usually think of but um there are a couple of places in the San Francisco area that are considered environmental campsites that are
sw3793B-ms98-a-0006 16.789625 22.848750 sort of like rustic cabins they have no um electricity and no water
sw3793B-ms98-a-0007 22.848750 26.157000 but there's usually a pot belly stove or something like that and
sw3793B-ms98-a-0008 26.157000 30.984750 you can spread out sleeping bags on on uh wooden surfaces so
sw3793B-ms98-a-0009 30.984750 35.303750 it's a pseudo cabin but they call it environmental camping [laughter]
sw3793B-ms98-a-0010 35.303750 37.364375 we really enjoy that
sw3793B-ms98-a-0011 37.364375 42.524875 [silence]
sw3793B-ms98-a-0012 42.524875 44.917125 oh that's beautiful
sw3793B-ms98-a-0013 44.917125 54.943125 [silence]
sw3793B-ms98-a-0014 54.943125 57.029750 [laughter-uh-huh]
sw3793B-ms98-a-0015 57.029750 62.693875 is it one [vocalized-noise] when you've been there is it one of those uh state park arrangements where
sw3793B-ms98-a-0016 62.693875 66.490125 [silence]
sw3793B-ms98-a-0017 66.490125 68.101375 uh-huh
sw3793B-ms98-a-0018 68.101375 70.186250 [silence]
sw3793B-ms98-a-0019 70.186250 71.840625 oh
sw3793B-ms98-a-0020 71.840625 79.600500 [silence]
sw3793B-ms98-a-0021 79.600500 82.425750 i don't think i've ever seen a john tent that's
sw3793B-ms98-a-0022 82.425750 86.497250 that's more rustic camping perhaps than i've done usually where someplace where we're sort of close to
sw3793B-ms98-a-0023 86.497250 87.875125 [noise]
sw3793B-ms98-a-0024 87.875125 91.133250 [silence]
sw3793B-ms98-a-0025 91.133250 93.857125 uh-huh uh-huh
sw3793B-ms98-a-0026 93.857125 99.549750 that's great [laughter] do you usually spend then quite a few days
sw3793B-ms98-a-0027 99.549750 101.494375 oh wow
sw3793B-ms98-a-0028 101.494375 106.269250 how do you like that i don't think i've ever been camping quite that long that seems like
sw3793B-ms98-a-0029 106.269250 109.077625 without showers and all you how how did you
sw3793B-ms98-a-0030 109.077625 110.708375 how did you enjoy that
sw3793B-ms98-a-0031 110.708375 114.404250 [silence]
sw3793B-ms98-a-0032 114.404250 116.494125 [laughter]
sw3793B-ms98-a-0033 116.494125 119.250750 [silence]
sw3793B-ms98-a-0034 119.250750 124.456875 [laughter] so it was sort of an annual thing every year for a while
sw3793B-ms98-a-0035 124.456875 129.640000 sounds like fun thing about Shasta too is there's so many other things that you can do
sw3793B-ms98-a-0036 129.640000 132.466625 [silence]
sw3793B-ms98-a-0037 132.466625 136.177250 uh-huh is Patterson fairly close to Shasta
sw3793B-ms98-a-0038 136.177250 138.759375 [silence]
sw3793B-ms98-a-0039 138.759375 140.472750 oh okay
sw3793B-ms98-a-0040 140.472750 142.125500 [silence]

sw3793B-ms98-a-0045 150.054875 151.705750 uh-huh
sw3793B-ms98-a-0046 151.705750 159.029250 there are a lot of uh camping grounds county and state facilities in the Santa Cruz mountains south of here so
sw3793B-ms98-a-0047 159.029250 162.604125 tends to be a good place for us to get away sometimes
sw3793B-ms98-a-0048 162.604125 172.234625 we have one two year old so actually we'd been camping for a long time before she was born and [laughter] just now introducing her to her it to her rather [noise] 
sw3793B-ms98-a-0049 172.234625 173.287375 [silence]
sw3793B-ms98-a-0050 173.287375 181.978875 yeah they really enjoy it i think that she's at an age now you're not as concerned about where she's going to run off to she can pretty much stay close and
sw3793B-ms98-a-0051 181.978875 185.050750 i think her first camping trip she was eight months old so
sw3793B-ms98-a-0052 185.050750 186.087875 [silence]
sw3793B-ms98-a-0053 186.087875 188.813000 hopefully she'll learn to enjoy it as much as we do
sw3793B-ms98-a-0054 188.813000 195.127125 [silence]
sw3793B-ms98-a-0055 195.127125 196.544125 uh-huh
sw3793B-ms98-a-0056 196.544125 199.492000 [silence]
sw3793B-ms98-a-0057 199.492000 203.487000 um-hum that's that's kind of fun we did that once in Yosemite too
sw3793B-ms98-a-0058 203.487000 207.160500 [silence]
sw3793B-ms98-a-0059 207.160500 217.783250 [laughter-right] that was one good reason in Yosemite the person in the camper next to us had gotten hit by the bears that night so we were glad we were a little more secure
sw3793B-ms98-a-0060 217.783250 218.892375 [silence]
sw3793B-ms98-a-0061 218.892375 225.896375 yes in fact i've never been camping at all in Yosemite outside of the uh the camper arrangement i know that they have tent cabins
sw3793B-ms98-a-0062 225.896375 229.152125 that sort of remind me of the environmental cabin situation but
sw3793B-ms98-a-0063 229.152125 237.461125 [silence]
sw3793B-ms98-a-0064 237.461125 244.946375 yeah it's a beautiful place i think i worry that it's changing so much so quickly the valley has become so popular
sw3793B-ms98-a-0065 244.946375 250.402500 [silence]
sw3793B-ms98-a-0066 250.402500 256.334375 do you remember it a a long time ago i don't know if you ever went there like back in the fifties or
sw3793B-ms98-a-0067 256.334375 259.306375 [silence]
sw3793B-ms98-a-0068 259.306375 260.890875 oh uh-huh
sw3793B-ms98-a-0069 260.890875 270.613000 my folks used to tell me about trips that we took when we were little um and that at that time there really weren't del[egated]- designated campsites so um
sw3793B-ms98-a-0070 270.613000 275.962500 people would basically come as soon as they could to stakeout their their terrain and
sw3793B-ms98-a-0071 275.962500 289.419250 put themselves [laughter-basically] [laughter-anywhere] they could find a spot so you go to bed at night and have a few people around you a[nd]- wake up in the morning and just be surrounded [laughter] there were no limitations in other words to the campsite there were people everywhere
sw3793B-ms98-a-0072 289.419250 291.673750 it's a little bit better arrangement today
sw3793B-ms98-a-0073 291.673750 295.588625 [silence]
sw3793B-ms98-a-0074 295.588625 297.438875 um-hum um-hum
