sw3753A-ms98-a-0002 0.483375 8.311000 well actually at this point my understanding of the space program is a little on the limited side um
sw3753A-ms98-a-0003 8.311000 9.551000 [silence]
sw3753A-ms98-a-0004 9.551000 12.805500 yeah well that's to an extent that's understandable
sw3753A-ms98-a-0005 12.805500 17.813250 [silence]
sw3753A-ms98-a-0006 17.813250 18.969625 yeah

sw3753A-ms98-a-0012 37.413750 41.609125 oh it's supposed to be more of a colony than a than a research lab
sw3753A-ms98-a-0013 41.609125 47.060000 [silence]
sw3753A-ms98-a-0014 47.060000 48.395500 yeah

sw3753A-ms98-a-0016 50.575125 55.889125 yeah like a central unit and then everything else kind of rotating out from that

sw3753A-ms98-a-0018 59.365250 60.629750 yeah

sw3753A-ms98-a-0022 70.720625 72.238625 oh okay
sw3753A-ms98-a-0023 72.238625 78.365625 [silence]
sw3753A-ms98-a-0024 78.365625 80.882625 they they had thought that out or hadn't
sw3753A-ms98-a-0025 80.882625 84.487125 [silence]
sw3753A-ms98-a-0026 84.487125 85.789625 yeah

sw3753A-ms98-a-0030 96.649500 104.365375 yeah so it was all modular like you send up a small section it'd be liveable for a couple of people and they send up another section and bolt it on and
sw3753A-ms98-a-0031 104.365375 106.323000 [silence]
sw3753A-ms98-a-0032 106.323000 108.000875 [noise] yeah

sw3753A-ms98-a-0034 109.371125 113.261375 yeah well that sort of thing could work um
sw3753A-ms98-a-0035 113.261375 118.520375 [noise] what did th[ey]- d[id]- d[id]- was there any indication what they're going do about uh gravity
sw3753A-ms98-a-0036 118.520375 121.081375 or were they just gonna let you bob around
sw3753A-ms98-a-0037 121.081375 123.369375 [silence]
sw3753A-ms98-a-0038 123.369375 124.663500 hm

sw3753A-ms98-a-0040 130.910125 131.914125 yeah
sw3753A-ms98-a-0041 131.914125 135.642250 [silence]
sw3753A-ms98-a-0042 135.642250 142.800250 now what what they've started figuring out lately is that gravity or some form of it makes it a whole lot easier to stay up there for long periods
sw3753A-ms98-a-0043 142.800250 154.514875 some of the uh i i've heard little bits of stuff about some of their things they found out about that w[as]- was it one and a half year stay some Soviet cosmonauts spent up in space
sw3753A-ms98-a-0044 154.514875 168.552500 and they had some problems digestive tract problems and uh uh minor circulator[y]- uh little problems but they could eventually become pretty big problems or if people people with with problems to start with that weren't really noticed yet
sw3753A-ms98-a-0045 168.552500 172.362375 they they could generate into big problems um
sw3753A-ms98-a-0046 172.362375 175.790125 [silence]
sw3753A-ms98-a-0047 175.790125 176.967750 yeah
sw3753A-ms98-a-0048 176.967750 180.517000 [silence]
sw3753A-ms98-a-0049 180.517000 186.204750 that's why a lot of the um designs for space stations have been circular
sw3753A-ms98-a-0050 186.204750 199.029500 so they can get them_1 spinning centrifugal force comes close enough to uh uh simulating gravity that there's very little problem with uh uh {gravityless} uh side effects
sw3753A-ms98-a-0051 199.029500 206.642125 you know i don't know if you saw it was it two thousand and one that uh that double wheel arrangement
sw3753A-ms98-a-0052 206.642125 211.183125 [noise] that's uh one of the more popular theories
sw3753A-ms98-a-0053 211.183125 223.795125 they also have them_1 where you got a long central cylinder kind of like a like a cross connection tube and a lot of pods sticking out from that central core kind of like a big pine cone like deal
sw3753A-ms98-a-0054 223.795125 230.520125 or a bottle brush almost where the pods are all rotating in enough of a a
sw3753A-ms98-a-0055 230.520125 240.036750 a rotation speed so that the centrifugal force pretty much is one uh i[s]- is equal to earth gravity
sw3753A-ms98-a-0056 240.036750 241.460125 so
sw3753A-ms98-a-0057 241.460125 247.638000 [silence]
sw3753A-ms98-a-0058 247.638000 249.913625 no no i've not

sw3753A-ms98-a-0062 261.892250 270.722625 well actually it needs to be put off for a little while for now just because_1 there's so much money going into it that would be a whole lot better spent on on local problems
sw3753A-ms98-a-0063 270.722625 276.875250 um the health care and and uh law enforcement uh

sw3753A-ms98-a-0071 294.381500 298.402000 uh the bulk of them_1 probably have aren't even pressurized
