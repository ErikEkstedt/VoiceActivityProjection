sw3753B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.457000 [noise] do you know about the space program
sw3753B-ms98-a-0002 1.457000 6.744500 [silence]
sw3753B-ms98-a-0003 6.744500 7.951625 [laughter]
sw3753B-ms98-a-0004 7.951625 10.147125 think they keep it that way purposely
sw3753B-ms98-a-0005 10.147125 12.041625 [silence]
sw3753B-ms98-a-0006 12.041625 17.993250 yeah it's gonna take uh i think it's gonna take a long time before they uh get that space colony out there
sw3753B-ms98-a-0007 17.993250 26.459750 they uh i remember uh six five six years ago they showed on uh one of the scientific channels you know not Discovery but one of those old ones
sw3753B-ms98-a-0008 26.459750 36.050500 they had some professor on there who was uh building a it was like a it was kind of like a space station but it was supposed to be for people you know and uh experimental stages
sw3753B-ms98-a-0009 36.050500 38.426750 and it's supposed to be about ten miles long
sw3753B-ms98-a-0010 38.426750 40.566250 [silence]
sw3753B-ms98-a-0011 40.566250 47.547500 right right well th[ey]- they were all gonna be research scientists out there and they were just gonna build it up and make it bigger and bigger
sw3753B-ms98-a-0012 47.547500 53.153875 and but the initial stage was supposed to be about_1 ten miles long which is i mean huge for i guess for space
sw3753B-ms98-a-0013 53.153875 55.242125 [silence]
sw3753B-ms98-a-0014 55.242125 56.567000 um
sw3753B-ms98-a-0015 56.567000 68.302500 no it was more like uh one big long thing it wasn't uh anything circular i've seen a circular pattern too uh [vocalized-noise] but i don't know if uh you know how far along they went with the circular pattern 
sw3753B-ms98-a-0016 68.302500 79.918875 but uh like i say this was a long time ago and uh they this is one big long one that they had planned on and they had thought out how they were gonna uh regenerate the air with plants and stuff and they had a
sw3753B-ms98-a-0017 79.918875 85.057500 no they had they had thought out they had thought it out only the only thing was it was really really expensive and it was
sw3753B-ms98-a-0018 85.057500 93.165000 not if you got to think about it was five or six years they said you know by nineteen ninety seven or nineteen ninety eight we would actually be able to uh to start launching this thing
sw3753B-ms98-a-0019 93.165000 97.744750 and they'd have to take several projects to go up there before and add on piece by piece
sw3753B-ms98-a-0020 97.744750 99.730125 um-hum um-hum
sw3753B-ms98-a-0021 99.730125 103.367875 [silence]
sw3753B-ms98-a-0022 103.367875 109.528875 right and then they've and once it got big enough they would send more people up once it got established and they got all the systems working
sw3753B-ms98-a-0023 109.528875 111.848000 yeah pretty fascinating
sw3753B-ms98-a-0024 111.848000 118.496000 [silence]
sw3753B-ms98-a-0025 118.496000 131.887375 no it was pretty it wa[s]- no it was a it was a gravity free [laughter-environment] they uh they had show[n]- they had shown like at some sort of uh simulation on how it would be up there and they showed people floating around so uh
sw3753B-ms98-a-0026 131.887375 137.058625 a[t]- at the p[oint]- i don't think there was any kind of uh you know gravity control whatsoever

sw3753B-ms98-a-0042 171.975375 181.975625 no uh these these people definitely didn't look into any kind of stuff like that they were just talking about the space station itself and how were they gonna put it up there and spend all this money they uh

sw3753B-ms98-a-0066 248.154500 258.539250 the uh at the EPCOT Center i[n]- in uh i think it's the the AT and T display they show a a bunch of uh future space pods and what life would be like out in space
sw3753B-ms98-a-0067 258.539250 262.314000 it's it's pretty neat i still think it's a long ways away though

sw3753B-ms98-a-0074 282.177750 295.349500 just j[ust]- i mean space programs themselves you know i uh i work in the uh in the satellite telecommunication business and putting up satellites is ridiculous expensive and these things are unmanned just a bunch of electronics we [laughter-shoot] [laughter-out] [laughter-in] [laughter-space] [laughter-you] [laughter-know]
