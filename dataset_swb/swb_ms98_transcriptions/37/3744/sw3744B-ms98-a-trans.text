sw3744B-ms98-a-0024 117.084875 127.517750 well uh you know f[ive]- five years ago could you h[ave]- have imagined in your in your your wildest dreams that something as as a change as rapid as this would've occurred
sw3744B-ms98-a-0025 127.517750 129.080625 [silence]
sw3744B-ms98-a-0026 129.080625 139.197500 it's just you know it it's almost unthinkable but it it is hey in a i i still wonder whether you know that it's going to be stable and then what's going to happen there
sw3744B-ms98-a-0027 139.197500 171.172875 [silence]
sw3744B-ms98-a-0028 171.172875 173.790375 but i don't think the shelves -[i]s bare anymore

sw3744B-ms98-a-0034 184.878000 187.218250 you know i- i i think that uh
sw3744B-ms98-a-0035 187.218250 193.134375 there's sti[ll]- but but you know the the people don't have a lot of money to pay for them there there's a tremendous uh
sw3744B-ms98-a-0036 193.134375 204.311750 gap in their ability to to supply themselves uh uh that could create a tremendous amount of political sta[bility]- instability in fact they said tonight on the on the radio uh that
sw3744B-ms98-a-0037 204.311750 205.598500 uh
sw3744B-ms98-a-0038 205.598500 216.042500 some some leader in in in o[f]- of the parliament i[n]- in Russia is calling for Yeltsin to essentially throw out all of his ministers and replace them

sw3744B-ms98-a-0040 217.271625 223.005125 because of th[is]- this tremendous supply demand uh type gap that they have there

sw3744B-ms98-a-0042 225.047125 226.868750 i don't know it it's it's
sw3744B-ms98-a-0043 226.868750 230.835125 -[i]t's hard to imagine managing such a rapid change
sw3744B-ms98-a-0044 230.835125 253.126125 [silence]
sw3744B-ms98-a-0045 253.126125 257.436875 well and and i think that you know we we stand uh
sw3744B-ms98-a-0046 257.436875 269.840000 i[n]- in in the possibility o[f]- of in of of being confronted with a similar kind of thing here uh everybody -[i]s is calling for you know this th[is]- th[is]- this
sw3744B-ms98-a-0047 269.840000 273.366250 uh peace dividend and

sw3744B-ms98-a-0049 277.748750 282.678750 the possibility of everybody proposing something radical to to
sw3744B-ms98-a-0050 282.678750 289.651875 appeal to the voters to t[o]- to get elected but you know how how rapidly can they change and how rapid can they move
