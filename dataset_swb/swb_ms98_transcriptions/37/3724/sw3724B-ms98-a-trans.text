sw3724B-ms98-a-0016 56.676500 63.252875 ooh yeah i i think it it's pro[bably]- the thing is that it's always fairly obvious in a small one right because um ye[ah]- 
sw3724B-ms98-a-0017 63.252875 66.504625 yeah everybody knows what everybody else is doing and and knows that it's
sw3724B-ms98-a-0018 66.504625 68.528000 it's generally important
sw3724B-ms98-a-0019 68.528000 69.856625 but

sw3724B-ms98-a-0023 77.985000 84.207625 what what about what about uh advantages of large organizations i mean benefits and things

sw3724B-ms98-a-0027 89.568125 97.231500 yeah when it when i've worked with a with i mean the the small things i've worked with really haven't had any uh any consistent
sw3724B-ms98-a-0028 97.231500 105.581750 yeah or any any kind of quality package right i me[an]- it just kind of leaves you on your own yeah i i've had my own little business and then i've worked for small businesses
sw3724B-ms98-a-0029 105.581750 113.681125 and yeah the the the only ones that i've had large uh uh i mean i've had health care and and and other kinds of benefits with have been large organizations
sw3724B-ms98-a-0030 113.681125 118.386375 also i work for the university and that that's a is very large organization 
sw3724B-ms98-a-0031 118.386375 120.184625 and uh
sw3724B-ms98-a-0032 120.184625 124.488750 [silence]
sw3724B-ms98-a-0033 124.488750 138.157000 i y[ou]- you know relative to nothing of course you know i mean it it i think so um the question you know i mean it's it's it's handy to have them_1 i just had gotten used to just not having insurance benefits and things um 
sw3724B-ms98-a-0034 138.157000 149.447875 um typically let's see uh typically the myself i- i was covered myself but my family wasn't you know i had to chip in t[o]- for them to be covered but it was pretty economical
sw3724B-ms98-a-0035 149.447875 153.779875 um especially relative to just buying your own health care package
sw3724B-ms98-a-0036 153.779875 165.084625 yeah and so you kn[ow]- so that's that's handy uh you know i think that i[t]- i'm amazed that uh of the one place i was working uh what they calculate to be their overhead
sw3724B-ms98-a-0037 165.084625 172.376625 uh because of benefits they figure uh i mean it's something like thirty five forty or fifty percent of of salary
sw3724B-ms98-a-0038 172.376625 175.878875 and [laughter] which is which is pretty amazing

sw3724B-ms98-a-0044 204.512750 211.938375 i i think so yeah it really does um do you get other benefits besides health do you have life insurance and things like that

sw3724B-ms98-a-0051 244.194000 250.857375 um do are you finding that that uh the packages uh that your benefits packages are shrinking

sw3724B-ms98-a-0060 281.195250 290.857250 typ[ically]- y[ou]- typically pay for dependents and and not for yourself but i i've the you know my company the company i was working with really has has been um
sw3724B-ms98-a-0061 290.857250 298.946000 you know they don't wanna cut back benefits but on the other hand they're real concerned about the rising costs and and sort of scaling uh uh you know keeping
