sw3724A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 2.170375 [noise] do work in a large organization now
sw3724A-ms98-a-0002 2.170375 11.625250 [silence]
sw3724A-ms98-a-0003 11.625250 13.009500 uh-huh
sw3724A-ms98-a-0004 13.009500 19.460375 [silence]
sw3724A-ms98-a-0005 19.460375 20.918875 uh-huh
sw3724A-ms98-a-0006 20.918875 22.030125 [silence]
sw3724A-ms98-a-0007 22.030125 23.252500 uh-huh
sw3724A-ms98-a-0008 23.252500 25.149500 [silence]
sw3724A-ms98-a-0009 25.149500 27.678250 oh yeah that's pretty [laughter-big]
sw3724A-ms98-a-0010 27.678250 33.617875 i work in a hospital and i think probably there are about seven or eight hundred employees
sw3724A-ms98-a-0011 33.617875 39.308750 i guess um the thing i was thinking about as i was pondering this question is um
sw3724A-ms98-a-0012 39.308750 50.097375 besides salary it seems that people if it's a large enough place need to feel that their job's an important one you know that they have the respect of their fellow employees and their boss
sw3724A-ms98-a-0013 50.097375 57.190250 yeah yeah it's it's more probably an issue in a large organization than it would be in a small one
sw3724A-ms98-a-0014 57.190250 60.847750 [silence]
sw3724A-ms98-a-0015 60.847750 63.678375 right everyone's so integral
sw3724A-ms98-a-0016 63.678375 67.615000 [silence]
sw3724A-ms98-a-0017 67.615000 79.175375 um-hum upward mobility or an opportunity to grow and learn different job tasks is probably an important one but it seemed to me that the respect of others is probably real important too
sw3724A-ms98-a-0018 79.175375 83.860500 [silence]
sw3724A-ms98-a-0019 83.860500 91.302875 well i definitely think that health care packages and that sort of thing are probably gonna be easier to coordinate you kn[ow]- in a larger
sw3724A-ms98-a-0020 91.302875 100.339625 [silence]
sw3724A-ms98-a-0021 100.339625 103.534750 really in health care uh-huh
sw3724A-ms98-a-0022 103.534750 112.743000 [silence]
sw3724A-ms98-a-0023 112.743000 115.612500 uh-huh vacation and
sw3724A-ms98-a-0024 115.612500 118.896625 [silence]
sw3724A-ms98-a-0025 118.896625 124.889625 and were those good um considering the the size of that kind of organization did you feel like that you had good benefits
sw3724A-ms98-a-0026 124.889625 135.013500 [silence]
sw3724A-ms98-a-0027 135.013500 139.729500 uh-huh uh-huh did you pay for them on your own or did you just go without
sw3724A-ms98-a-0028 139.729500 147.537500 [silence]
sw3724A-ms98-a-0029 147.537500 150.210625 um-hum um-hum
sw3724A-ms98-a-0030 150.210625 152.242125 [silence]
sw3724A-ms98-a-0031 152.242125 155.031750 right that really gets prohibitive
sw3724A-ms98-a-0032 155.031750 171.219625 [silence]
sw3724A-ms98-a-0033 171.219625 173.600750 yes i've heard that too
sw3724A-ms98-a-0034 173.600750 174.892375 [silence]
sw3724A-ms98-a-0035 174.892375 183.345250 it is e[specially]- especially if you consider in some situations people might actually use [laughter-that] [laughter-much] hopefully they budget for that and it doesn't get used up entirely but
sw3724A-ms98-a-0036 183.345250 184.652375 [silence]
sw3724A-ms98-a-0037 184.652375 189.582000 it's it's a lot i think that those sorts of advantages are nice i know um
sw3724A-ms98-a-0038 189.582000 199.328125 my benefits through the hospital cover my family since my husband works for himself out of our home and and and office that's elsewhere but he doesn't
sw3724A-ms98-a-0039 199.328125 206.080250 he didn't really ever pursue individual benefits and i think it makes a difference to be able to have the [laughter-security] of an organization's benefits
sw3724A-ms98-a-0040 206.080250 211.389375 [silence]
sw3724A-ms98-a-0041 211.389375 224.614000 i[t]- it actually it's interesting just this last week um they introduced what the nineteen ninety two package was gonna look like and while the life insurance that we have free from the hospital is limited to it's uh ten or fifteen thousand
sw3724A-ms98-a-0042 224.614000 231.001625 um they offered for the first time a life term that would be up to a hundred and fifty but you have to pay into it
sw3724A-ms98-a-0043 231.001625 236.043500 the rest of the package is pretty good it's vision and dental and you know all the full medical
sw3724A-ms98-a-0044 236.043500 242.294250 [silence]
sw3724A-ms98-a-0045 242.294250 243.623000 yeah
sw3724A-ms98-a-0046 243.623000 251.522000 [silence]
sw3724A-ms98-a-0047 251.522000 263.940125 you know i've seen that all over the bay area in San Francisco bay area at least and probably true in California i haven't yet at our hospital we've kind of been waiting with baited breath we're the only hospital that i know of that doesn't have uh
sw3724A-ms98-a-0048 263.940125 270.410875 a partial payment or i don't know if you call it copayment or premium by the the consumer
sw3724A-ms98-a-0049 270.410875 280.025500 so as as of this date [laughter] my husband and my kids are free because_1 they're dependents but i know a lot of other place like you were mentioning you know you pay if
sw3724A-ms98-a-0050 280.025500 295.569750 [silence]
sw3724A-ms98-a-0051 295.569750 297.283250 exactly
