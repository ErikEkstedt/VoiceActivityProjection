sw3796A-ms98-a-0004 12.614625 24.340875 they won in a squeaker they won by they won by two points uh they were behind as they headed into each quarter and then they came back [noise] in the second half and at the end i think they were
sw3796A-ms98-a-0005 24.340875 36.466125 uh looked they looked like they were closing it out and then Detroit kept coming back and uh Isaiah missed a three point attempt at the end and uh i think the Bulls won by two
sw3796A-ms98-a-0006 36.466125 39.288250 [silence]
sw3796A-ms98-a-0007 39.288250 51.401000 [noise] i think they do as a matter of fact one of the uh commentators said that they expected that the Bulls would uh if they continued at their current pace [noise] uh set an NBA record for seventy wins in a season
sw3796A-ms98-a-0008 51.401000 53.986875 yeah they looked real good and

sw3796A-ms98-a-0010 68.058625 69.904750 right
sw3796A-ms98-a-0011 69.904750 74.817125 yeah well they they're they're balancing their attack and i think they look like uh
sw3796A-ms98-a-0012 74.817125 81.885875 they'll repeat although uh here in the Bay Area people are real impressed with what Don Nelson's done with the Warriors
sw3796A-ms98-a-0013 81.885875 89.471375 [silence]
sw3796A-ms98-a-0014 89.471375 94.127000 i saw the the second half of the game last night and they were impressive
sw3796A-ms98-a-0015 94.127000 98.587875 Billy Owens looks like he was that was a good move for the Warriors to trade for him
sw3796A-ms98-a-0016 98.587875 101.960375 [silence]
sw3796A-ms98-a-0017 101.960375 104.785500 well they traded away uh
sw3796A-ms98-a-0018 104.785500 108.089875 Mitch Richmond or is it Tim Hardaway one of the two
sw3796A-ms98-a-0019 108.089875 122.797875 uh who along with uh Chris Mullin was you know though three were three of the best in the NBA and and they made a heck of a threesome and they traded either Richmond or Hardaway to Sacramento for Billy Owens and uh
sw3796A-ms98-a-0020 122.797875 128.611500 yeah oh yeah he's really worked out well they've got the the Warriors have got a team uh and uh
sw3796A-ms98-a-0021 128.611500 141.951875 i think that'll be real interesting to see what they can do they're ahead and the Lakers are down i guess in fourth uh position in the west and i don't know in the east i don't know uh is it Boston in uh first place
sw3796A-ms98-a-0022 141.951875 151.953875 [silence]

sw3796A-ms98-a-0025 169.675750 171.378125 yeah
sw3796A-ms98-a-0026 171.378125 178.879375 how do people in Texas deal with Dallas Houston and San Antonio do you for example like San Antonio uh in Dallas
sw3796A-ms98-a-0027 178.879375 187.434000 [silence]
sw3796A-ms98-a-0028 187.434000 190.458250 so there isn't much crossover huh y[ou]-
sw3796A-ms98-a-0029 190.458250 198.328500 [silence]

sw3796A-ms98-a-0032 206.412750 210.499750 yeah it's true because S[an]- San Antonio isn't that close to you are they
sw3796A-ms98-a-0033 210.499750 211.761250 no
sw3796A-ms98-a-0034 211.761250 215.130625 [silence]
sw3796A-ms98-a-0035 215.130625 216.737500 is it
sw3796A-ms98-a-0036 216.737500 220.253250 yeah so it's not something you'd drive
sw3796A-ms98-a-0037 220.253250 225.348375 yeah i was thinking maybe David Robinson made a bit of a difference with kids and that sort of thing
sw3796A-ms98-a-0038 225.348375 230.849375 [silence]
sw3796A-ms98-a-0039 230.849375 237.448250 they've done a good job i mean of course drafting a franchise like him certainly [laughter]
sw3796A-ms98-a-0040 237.448250 248.860500 yeah i mean that's i think the way it uh i think that's the way it works now in basketball you you know Magic was a franchise for the Lakers and you know uh Bird for the for the uh Celtics and
sw3796A-ms98-a-0041 248.860500 255.452500 [silence]

sw3796A-ms98-a-0046 267.518000 278.244000 well i think you're right and i think Isaiah Thomas would fit in Detroit and i think those things do make a difference and there are [noise] marquee players and i think i think Jordan and the and the Bulls have to be
sw3796A-ms98-a-0047 278.244000 287.756125 [noise] uh considered the likely favorites i don't know who would meet them in the west um i don't know how good Portland will turn out to be by the end of the year they were so disappointing
sw3796A-ms98-a-0048 287.756125 298.850000 [noise] you know i wasn't i- i d[idn't]- i watched only a few minutes of it and i wasn't paying attention uh [noise] so i don't know uh but Phoenix you know Phoenix and Portland have both been very good clubs and
