sw3782A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.152375 [noise]
sw3782A-ms98-a-0002 0.152375 2.997000 so what do you think about the uh income taxes
sw3782A-ms98-a-0003 2.997000 4.693000 [silence]
sw3782A-ms98-a-0004 4.693000 6.322000 where do you live
sw3782A-ms98-a-0005 6.322000 8.705625 okay i live in Dallas too
sw3782A-ms98-a-0006 8.705625 9.891750 [silence]
sw3782A-ms98-a-0007 9.891750 14.691000 [noise] okay i live in uh in the Village do you know where that is i-
sw3782A-ms98-a-0008 14.691000 21.007625 yeah well one thing i can tell you i hate about the taxes in Dallas is the eight and a quarter percent sales tax
sw3782A-ms98-a-0009 21.007625 26.452000 it i think it's like the highest in the US because my sister lived in New York and it was only seven percent there
sw3782A-ms98-a-0010 26.452000 28.809250 Washington DC was only six percent
sw3782A-ms98-a-0011 28.809250 33.815500 and where i moved from Virginia was only four and a half percent and i can tell you we were upset when it went to four and a half
sw3782A-ms98-a-0012 33.815500 35.782125 it was only four percent
sw3782A-ms98-a-0013 35.782125 40.105500 [silence]
sw3782A-ms98-a-0014 40.105500 41.550625 really
sw3782A-ms98-a-0015 41.550625 46.275625 [silence]
sw3782A-ms98-a-0016 46.275625 48.558750 um-hum um-hum
sw3782A-ms98-a-0017 48.558750 50.010500 [laughter]
sw3782A-ms98-a-0018 50.010500 51.135625 what
sw3782A-ms98-a-0019 51.135625 58.524125 since there's no uh state tax i assume that that's why it went up fast because_1 Virginia does have a state tax
sw3782A-ms98-a-0020 58.524125 60.834500 [silence]
sw3782A-ms98-a-0021 60.834500 62.678500 um-hum hm
sw3782A-ms98-a-0022 62.678500 64.151750 [silence]
sw3782A-ms98-a-0023 64.151750 65.513750 [noise] yeah it
sw3782A-ms98-a-0024 65.513750 67.530500 [silence]
sw3782A-ms98-a-0025 67.530500 70.175000 [noise] if they put state tax in i mean i'll be pretty upset
sw3782A-ms98-a-0026 70.175000 79.649375 because_1 i mean part of the reason part of the incentives of moving to Texas from Virginia was the fact that you have no state tax and basically it adds about sixty dollars to your paycheck
sw3782A-ms98-a-0027 79.649375 84.422875 uh every two weeks and uh [noise] if that comes back in
sw3782A-ms98-a-0028 84.422875 87.822250 i'll be pretty mad because_1 sixty dollars a paycheck is a lot of money actually you know
sw3782A-ms98-a-0029 87.822250 92.564250 so uh i don't know i'm not very much for a for state tax
sw3782A-ms98-a-0030 92.564250 93.865625 [laughter]
sw3782A-ms98-a-0031 93.865625 97.742875 yeah they keep talking about uh you know the light rail system adding taxes
sw3782A-ms98-a-0032 97.742875 102.331875 and then uh there was another issue that came up i forget uh the horse racing
sw3782A-ms98-a-0033 102.331875 109.205375 they're putting up the the racing fees they said they may raise taxes because_1 of that yeah they said uh to build okay
sw3782A-ms98-a-0034 109.205375 113.077375 apparently they said the builders would provide thirty million dollars in funds
sw3782A-ms98-a-0035 113.077375 116.369500 and the state would need to provide sixty five million dollars in funds
sw3782A-ms98-a-0036 116.369500 120.192875 well in order to get the sixty five million dollars it would cause an increase in taxes
sw3782A-ms98-a-0037 120.192875 122.732125 but it seems like it would pay itself off
sw3782A-ms98-a-0038 122.732125 127.277625 so you know [laughter] what's the purpose of the increasing the sales tax you know
sw3782A-ms98-a-0039 127.277625 129.689125 yeah so you know
sw3782A-ms98-a-0040 129.689125 130.745375 [silence]
sw3782A-ms98-a-0041 130.745375 132.940000 yeah things like that you know
sw3782A-ms98-a-0042 132.940000 136.068000 [silence]
sw3782A-ms98-a-0043 136.068000 137.327625 um-hum
sw3782A-ms98-a-0044 137.327625 140.781500 [silence]
sw3782A-ms98-a-0045 140.781500 142.935500 [laughter]
sw3782A-ms98-a-0046 142.935500 144.410500 [silence]
sw3782A-ms98-a-0047 144.410500 146.276625 no huh
sw3782A-ms98-a-0048 146.276625 151.562125 [silence]
sw3782A-ms98-a-0049 151.562125 164.059000 um-hum i mean you know federal tax i mean everybody has to pay standard around the US and that doesn't bother me that much you know the you buy a house you cut your taxes a little bit the rest of it you pay what you owe
sw3782A-ms98-a-0050 164.059000 173.145875 but uh [noise] like sales tax and i where i lived in uh in Virginia they had personal property tax in the counties
sw3782A-ms98-a-0051 173.145875 182.494125 and that was a lot my parents paid almost four thousand dollars a year in personal property tax on the house they paid almost a thousand dollars on uh
sw3782A-ms98-a-0052 182.494125 189.936875 on two of our cars and they paid like a couple hundred dollars on the other cars but the personal property tax itself used to add up
sw3782A-ms98-a-0053 189.936875 194.959125 you know just i mean itself would probably add up to seven or eight thousand dollars a year
sw3782A-ms98-a-0054 194.959125 205.440125 and that's a lot of money you know most places go ahead and just you know put it into your mortgage payment so you don't forget about it at the last minute you know and have to come up with the funds at the end of the year
sw3782A-ms98-a-0055 205.440125 208.127125 but that gets real expensive
sw3782A-ms98-a-0056 208.127125 209.471000 [silence]
sw3782A-ms98-a-0057 209.471000 212.676500 do they have that kind of tax down here on the houses at all do you know
sw3782A-ms98-a-0058 212.676500 218.557625 [silence]
sw3782A-ms98-a-0059 218.557625 219.954125 um
sw3782A-ms98-a-0060 219.954125 222.219625 [silence]
sw3782A-ms98-a-0061 222.219625 223.499000 um-hum
sw3782A-ms98-a-0062 223.499000 225.587250 [silence]
sw3782A-ms98-a-0063 225.587250 231.493000 well you know like every year they renew the registration here kind of like fifty or sixty bucks 
sw3782A-ms98-a-0064 231.493000 239.688250 so it's only like fifty or sixty bucks to renew your registration here but in Virginia they won't renew your registration till you pay your pr[operty]- personal property tax
sw3782A-ms98-a-0065 239.688250 244.661750 and i had a i- [vocalized-noise] i paid you know twelve hundred dollars [laughter-a] [laughter-year] for my last car
sw3782A-ms98-a-0066 244.661750 248.099500 for personal property tax alone so that was kind of a relief i guess
sw3782A-ms98-a-0067 248.099500 252.147500 that's not too bad but other than that everything worked out
sw3782A-ms98-a-0068 252.147500 254.168750 [silence]
sw3782A-ms98-a-0069 254.168750 255.671625 what's that
sw3782A-ms98-a-0070 255.671625 257.835000 i've been here about two years now
sw3782A-ms98-a-0071 257.835000 261.598750 but uh in the two years i've i've been here i've been through i've had two cars
sw3782A-ms98-a-0072 261.598750 263.535000 so i've never really like you know
sw3782A-ms98-a-0073 263.535000 267.481375 i don't know if they if they ever will assess a personal uh any kind of tax
sw3782A-ms98-a-0074 267.481375 271.836375 on the car other than what i paid when i r[egistered]- uh registered the car
sw3782A-ms98-a-0075 271.836375 274.406375 so that's the only thing i can really think of
sw3782A-ms98-a-0076 274.406375 278.063250 so so do you work for TI or you just doing this
sw3782A-ms98-a-0077 278.063250 279.670000 [silence]
sw3782A-ms98-a-0078 279.670000 283.948875 okay yeah someone just mentioned this program to me so i thought it'd be kind of cool
sw3782A-ms98-a-0079 283.948875 287.861875 [silence]
sw3782A-ms98-a-0080 287.861875 289.503875 oh do they really
sw3782A-ms98-a-0081 289.503875 291.558125 [silence]
sw3782A-ms98-a-0082 291.558125 295.180125 yeah i- i don't know how the thing works uh
sw3782A-ms98-a-0083 295.180125 299.522000 oh really [laughter] all right you
