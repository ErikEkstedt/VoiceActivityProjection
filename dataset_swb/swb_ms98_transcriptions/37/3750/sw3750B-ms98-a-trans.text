sw3750B-ms98-a-0002 0.560125 2.398750 [silence]
sw3750B-ms98-a-0003 2.398750 7.480000 oh yeah i uh like like you i haven't done it in quite some time
sw3750B-ms98-a-0004 7.480000 17.858375 except for what i call living now [laughter] which is which is very close to camping [laughter] yeah you know i i camped in the Boy Scouts and uh
sw3750B-ms98-a-0005 17.858375 29.582875 you know my dad and i went out sometimes but uh even my first uh eight or nine years of working i camped almost all the time because_1 i was in construction
sw3750B-ms98-a-0006 29.582875 40.572625 and it's cheaper to pitch a tent and cook your meals out by the fire than it is to rent an apartment add to stress i mean you when you have to have it you got to have it
sw3750B-ms98-a-0007 40.572625 47.830625 and you know in uh in those those kinds of situations uh you know room rent was just outrageous
sw3750B-ms98-a-0008 47.830625 54.676375 so my buddy and i we just camped [laughter] and we figured what the hell we did it when we were kids and we loved it
sw3750B-ms98-a-0009 54.676375 62.014000 course we didn't really rough it that much when when i was in in high school uh he's a couple of years older than me and uh
sw3750B-ms98-a-0010 62.014000 67.382625 he graduated and went off to college and and du[ring]- during summer we'd camp out at the lake
sw3750B-ms98-a-0011 67.382625 77.243125 but it was wasn't very much like camping because_1 we had a refrigerator [laughter-and] [laughter-a] [laughter-stove] and you know i had a little uh boat house and floated it out on Lake Grapevine
sw3750B-ms98-a-0012 77.243125 83.689250 and uh well it was fantastic we'd get up in the morning go skiing
sw3750B-ms98-a-0013 83.689250 93.247500 at that substituted for a shower [laughter-you] [laughter-know] and then we'd go to work and uh come back to the you know to the boat house at night
sw3750B-ms98-a-0014 93.247500 99.181625 you know in in the afternoon you know it's still four o'clock you got four hours of day light good skiing left
sw3750B-ms98-a-0015 99.181625 101.331250 and uh it was great
sw3750B-ms98-a-0016 101.331250 107.772375 but uh you know now my life is more like camping than not camping really
sw3750B-ms98-a-0017 107.772375 116.468250 oh yeah [laughter] well actually as a matter of fact they just ran the phone three years ago we didn't have a phone
sw3750B-ms98-a-0018 116.468250 120.146375 and they didn't have phone lines i mean there was you just couldn't get a phone
sw3750B-ms98-a-0019 120.146375 126.123750 and uh we're on the we're third from the end on the electric string
sw3750B-ms98-a-0020 126.123750 136.269375 so uh and we're at the end of the mail route [laughter] like i said we are probably as far as you can get from a Seven Eleven and still be in Texas
sw3750B-ms98-a-0021 136.269375 142.947625 but uh you know right now uh what we did my wife and i is we got a a mobile home

sw3750B-ms98-a-0023 146.922875 157.592875 and uh i swapped them_1 a Cadillac for it and uh put it out here on the land figuring i'd build a house some day you know i'm in construction and uh 
sw3750B-ms98-a-0024 157.592875 169.966875 you know i just had this place you know to shower up while i was you know out here you know putting up fence and building driveway and drilling well and all that stuff that you have to do before you can even put a house in you know
sw3750B-ms98-a-0025 169.966875 181.906375 and uh i came home from work one Friday afternoon and our truck was [laughter-packed] everything we had was in boxes and my wife said uh we're moving [laughter]

sw3750B-ms98-a-0028 200.424125 203.109125 [silence]

sw3750B-ms98-a-0033 224.795875 227.895125 [silence]
