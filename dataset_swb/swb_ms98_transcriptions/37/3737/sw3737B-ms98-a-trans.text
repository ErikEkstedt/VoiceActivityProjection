sw3737B-ms98-a-0020 85.399000 98.546750 um yeah i i usually do my wood working for stuff that i want and for just so that i don't have to you know it's it's cheaper to to build it yourself than it is to go out and buy it from a furniture store
sw3737B-ms98-a-0021 98.546750 109.366125 so i i i do it for monetary and personal enjoyment it's it's it's it's an accomplishment to finish something that you that you made by yourself
sw3737B-ms98-a-0022 109.366125 113.151375 [silence]
sw3737B-ms98-a-0023 113.151375 123.912125 um it really depends on what you're making uh if if you're making a piece of furniture yeah you'd generally need a a good you know table saw and everything uh
sw3737B-ms98-a-0024 123.912125 131.954125 if it's just some little old knickknack or something you can usually get away with a like a hand held saw or something like that
sw3737B-ms98-a-0025 131.954125 132.984375 [silence]
sw3737B-ms98-a-0026 132.984375 134.426875 but uh
sw3737B-ms98-a-0027 134.426875 140.922625 it's a it's a lot of fun you just you have to be careful so you don't like go lopping your fingers off or anything
sw3737B-ms98-a-0028 140.922625 151.747125 my my dad's gotten into the to the the wood working stuff here lately and he's trying to make a a uh jewelry box for my grandmother for Christmas and uh
sw3737B-ms98-a-0029 151.747125 156.260125 he didn't get it finished because_1 he kept screwing up the lid for it but uh
sw3737B-ms98-a-0030 156.260125 167.748125 he uh he doesn't know all the the safety rules and everything so i had to kind of keep him from taking off a finger or two and there's a couple of things he's done that i've like near had nearly had a heart attack over
sw3737B-ms98-a-0031 167.748125 170.619125 it's like Dad you're doing it wrong

sw3737B-ms98-a-0042 217.426500 230.988000 it uh tries your patience sometimes because the the patterns aren't always the best things in the world they they draw you a pattern on a on a a piece of paper and you're supposed to like you know figure out all the dimensions and everything yourself and
sw3737B-ms98-a-0043 230.988000 237.159250 kind of helps if you can either get somebody else to do it or find somebody else that already has a good pattern and just copy it
