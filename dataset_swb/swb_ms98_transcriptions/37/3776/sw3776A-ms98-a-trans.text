sw3776A-ms98-a-0002 0.585375 6.092000 i uh spent four years as a university professor and yeah
sw3776A-ms98-a-0003 6.092000 9.019625 [silence]
sw3776A-ms98-a-0004 9.019625 12.038375 oh do you really that's great
sw3776A-ms98-a-0005 12.038375 13.064000 [silence]
sw3776A-ms98-a-0006 13.064000 15.055375 no kidding
sw3776A-ms98-a-0007 15.055375 15.693000 w[hat]-
sw3776A-ms98-a-0008 15.693000 18.908750 i did i did um
sw3776A-ms98-a-0009 18.908750 21.197750 [silence]
sw3776A-ms98-a-0010 21.197750 26.683000 well i was pretty young w[ell]- i was uh i had never intended to do it and i was uh
sw3776A-ms98-a-0011 26.683000 35.344250 uh given the opportunity after i'd started a management consulting firm to teach in in uh uh one of the business schools in the California State University system
sw3776A-ms98-a-0012 35.344250 43.533500 at any rate um the topic is fascinating because one of the things i've done for the past few years is um
sw3776A-ms98-a-0013 43.533500 54.209875 research the problem from the point of view of uh uh what appears to be working best and how you can explain it theoretically you may be familiar with cooperative learning
sw3776A-ms98-a-0014 54.209875 55.752500 have you ever [vocalized-noise]
sw3776A-ms98-a-0015 55.752500 58.992750 [silence]
sw3776A-ms98-a-0016 58.992750 68.562375 well the cooperative learning is a technique that was tried initially to integrate the public schools and uh what what it involves basically
sw3776A-ms98-a-0017 68.562375 77.807375 is the use of peer groups and the uh teacher becomes a uh a sort of a consultant resource person
sw3776A-ms98-a-0018 77.807375 89.485375 to the cooperative learning uh to the learning cooperatives i guess they're called and there are uh some fairly sophisticated approaches that are used in the high schools with point systems and things like that so that people uh
sw3776A-ms98-a-0019 89.485375 92.445375 gain a competence with respect to the material
sw3776A-ms98-a-0020 92.445375 105.725500 um i think that the combination of uh technology and techniques like that together with marketplace forces will bring about a revolution
sw3776A-ms98-a-0021 105.725500 113.367000 in the way we learn uh i think there is a direct threat to vested interest in the public school system
sw3776A-ms98-a-0022 113.367000 122.287500 uh that will stand in the way of that progress being a little faster uh school systems are in too many states dominated by administrators
sw3776A-ms98-a-0023 122.287500 134.354750 and uh both teachers and parents uh complain about the uh uh the cost and ineffectiveness that results so my feeling is that um
sw3776A-ms98-a-0024 134.354750 137.151000 the the problem is is
sw3776A-ms98-a-0025 137.151000 143.353375 uh significant there are plenty of good people uh available to
sw3776A-ms98-a-0026 143.353375 154.444000 um offer people educational experience but that we just have to re[allocate]- reallocate and reorganize the resources to do it and uh i think
sw3776A-ms98-a-0027 154.444000 161.551750 certain techniques and technologies will influence all of that as well as research um
sw3776A-ms98-a-0028 161.551750 174.103625 uh of the sort that people like me do looking at theories of behavior and how they can be used to improve performance particularly uh accelerate the the pace of learning
sw3776A-ms98-a-0029 174.103625 183.104125 and my feeling is that uh those kinds of things will solve the problem eventually i don't know what form it'll ultimately take
sw3776A-ms98-a-0030 183.104125 184.469375 um
sw3776A-ms98-a-0031 184.469375 187.371500 uh but i think that
sw3776A-ms98-a-0032 187.371500 193.258125 the future is pretty bright because people recognize that we're paying an enormous price for
sw3776A-ms98-a-0033 193.258125 200.184250 uh inferior quality when the people involved really aren't inferior so it must be the way we're managing the process that
sw3776A-ms98-a-0034 200.184250 201.567500 uh
sw3776A-ms98-a-0035 201.567500 203.544750 [silence]
sw3776A-ms98-a-0036 203.544750 204.950500 i- i don't
sw3776A-ms98-a-0037 204.950500 214.533375 i don't think it's it's a matter of of uh talented people to do it a[s]- both as quote unquote students and as teachers
sw3776A-ms98-a-0038 214.533375 221.088750 but clearly what's happened in this country is the school system's been asked to assume a great many responsibilities
sw3776A-ms98-a-0039 221.088750 231.158125 in the past thirty years that weren't existent uh you must see kids with real significant problems um in some cases
sw3776A-ms98-a-0040 231.158125 243.407125 uh course Iowa City i don't know how hard how hard is it uh in the public school system in Iowa City is it is it uh deteriorated a lot do the people say or are they pretty happy with it or
sw3776A-ms98-a-0041 243.407125 259.032750 [silence]
sw3776A-ms98-a-0042 259.032750 260.468250 right
sw3776A-ms98-a-0043 260.468250 263.828625 [silence]
sw3776A-ms98-a-0044 263.828625 265.724375 even in Utah
sw3776A-ms98-a-0045 265.724375 269.838125 well Utah's a place where you wouldn't think that problem would be very severe
sw3776A-ms98-a-0046 269.838125 278.489125 [silence]
sw3776A-ms98-a-0047 278.489125 281.417500 yeah you s[ee]- you saw a fair number of troubled kids
sw3776A-ms98-a-0048 281.417500 294.802500 [silence]
sw3776A-ms98-a-0049 294.802500 296.258500 yeah
