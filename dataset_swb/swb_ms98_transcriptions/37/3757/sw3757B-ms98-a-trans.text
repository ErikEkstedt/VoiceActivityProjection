sw3757B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.042875 [noise]
sw3757B-ms98-a-0002 1.042875 3.640750 [silence]
sw3757B-ms98-a-0003 3.640750 8.117375 um well i have i have two kids in school and
sw3757B-ms98-a-0004 8.117375 18.824250 and in comparing it with people who live in other parts of the world one of the things th[at]- things wrong is that our our schools our kids seem to go to school less
sw3757B-ms98-a-0005 18.824250 22.616250 o[f]- of the year than than kids in other countries
sw3757B-ms98-a-0006 22.616250 27.874000 um it seems like uh the long summer break is something that
sw3757B-ms98-a-0007 27.874000 29.440375 only
sw3757B-ms98-a-0008 29.440375 32.409625 uh only occurs in the United States
sw3757B-ms98-a-0009 32.409625 34.731875 [silence]
sw3757B-ms98-a-0010 34.731875 37.594125 um do you have any kids in school
sw3757B-ms98-a-0011 37.594125 40.277250 [silence]
sw3757B-ms98-a-0012 40.277250 41.585000 yeah
sw3757B-ms98-a-0013 41.585000 44.982000 [silence]
sw3757B-ms98-a-0014 44.982000 46.324625 yeah
sw3757B-ms98-a-0015 46.324625 54.584750 [silence]
sw3757B-ms98-a-0016 54.584750 59.892875 well some of th[e]- some of the uh schools are trying to go to more of a year around system
sw3757B-ms98-a-0017 59.892875 61.006125 [silence]
sw3757B-ms98-a-0018 61.006125 73.454250 and uh i guess there's pros and cons to that too i know if if if it happened here i would hope that uh you know i have uh two children that are two years a part i would just hope they were in the same system [laughter-so]
sw3757B-ms98-a-0019 73.454250 76.212125 if you wanna take a vacation you could
sw3757B-ms98-a-0020 76.212125 86.918625 [silence]
sw3757B-ms98-a-0021 86.918625 88.186250 yeah
sw3757B-ms98-a-0022 88.186250 90.356500 [silence]
sw3757B-ms98-a-0023 90.356500 96.062250 it could it could one of the other um things is that um
sw3757B-ms98-a-0024 96.062250 107.221000 uh there's been a lot of talk about uh American schools uh getting behind in science compared to uh lot of European schools and and Japan also
sw3757B-ms98-a-0025 107.221000 114.195625 that their schools are teaching uh more of the science sciences and putting out better
sw3757B-ms98-a-0026 114.195625 122.377750 uh graduates when in math and science uh for the future you know technology in various countries
sw3757B-ms98-a-0027 122.377750 124.719375 [silence]
sw3757B-ms98-a-0028 124.719375 130.016000 and that's not a favorite subject for either of my my kids it's probably not
sw3757B-ms98-a-0029 130.016000 142.742250 for anyone but it just seems like uh those are the criticisms criticisms you hear over and over about the the the American public school system and this is probably why a lot people [noise] go to private schools instead
sw3757B-ms98-a-0030 142.742250 149.249000 [silence]
sw3757B-ms98-a-0031 149.249000 162.771375 some of the some of the [noise] people that i work with uh they're they're some from various parts of the of the world and and uh course everybody likes to think their system's the best but the the ones in
sw3757B-ms98-a-0032 162.771375 170.072375 England and and then Germany seem seem to uh have some logical points about
sw3757B-ms98-a-0033 170.072375 175.206375 you know why do why do kids need a three month break in the summer
sw3757B-ms98-a-0034 175.206375 178.281750 and i i think that dates back to
sw3757B-ms98-a-0035 178.281750 188.281375 when America was agricultural and nature and and children needed to help on farms and it's been quite a while since that's been the [laughter-case] for most part now 
sw3757B-ms98-a-0036 188.281375 192.622750 and it seems though that's one of the things that ought to to change
sw3757B-ms98-a-0037 192.622750 199.892000 uh i'm not i'm not that happy to always be uh limited to just summers for most vacations and
sw3757B-ms98-a-0038 199.892000 203.950250 and uh Christmas time for the other you know the other one
sw3757B-ms98-a-0039 203.950250 209.954250 and compete with all the crowds since all the other people with uh families going on [laughter-vacation]
sw3757B-ms98-a-0040 209.954250 212.382625 tends to make some crowds
sw3757B-ms98-a-0041 212.382625 215.386875 did you go through the public school system
sw3757B-ms98-a-0042 215.386875 222.339250 uh uh uh yeah i did too and everyone else in [noise] my family but seems like uh
sw3757B-ms98-a-0043 222.339250 231.370250 uh if people can afford it the number of people go the private school route but that's of course not available to to the average person with
sw3757B-ms98-a-0044 231.370250 236.249375 [silence]
sw3757B-ms98-a-0045 236.249375 238.064875 yes uh-huh
sw3757B-ms98-a-0046 238.064875 240.604875 [silence]
sw3757B-ms98-a-0047 240.604875 247.628625 that i have mixed feelings about that too i guess whether or not they miss the social interaction a part of it
sw3757B-ms98-a-0048 247.628625 255.550750 [silence]
sw3757B-ms98-a-0049 255.550750 258.490125 yeah that that would help
sw3757B-ms98-a-0050 258.490125 281.115500 [silence]
sw3757B-ms98-a-0051 281.115500 282.942500 yeah uh-huh
sw3757B-ms98-a-0052 282.942500 293.329875 [noise] yeah the i i think that's why a lot of people go to the home schooling they they disagree with what they're exposed to either for religious reasons or or other reasons
sw3757B-ms98-a-0053 293.329875 295.168625 um
sw3757B-ms98-a-0054 295.168625 298.338000 the other thing that's happening now i guess is is
