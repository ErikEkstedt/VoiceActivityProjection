sw3797B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 2.328750 [noise] i guess we're ready to talk
sw3797B-ms98-a-0002 2.328750 6.141875 [silence]
sw3797B-ms98-a-0003 6.141875 12.090000 well let's talk about air pollution what do you think causes air pollution in Dallas [noise]
sw3797B-ms98-a-0004 12.090000 14.873375 or where are you from maybe you're not in Dallas
sw3797B-ms98-a-0005 14.873375 16.476625 [silence]
sw3797B-ms98-a-0006 16.476625 17.878375 okay
sw3797B-ms98-a-0007 17.878375 19.921500 [noise] uh [noise]
sw3797B-ms98-a-0008 19.921500 22.023375 [silence]
sw3797B-ms98-a-0009 22.023375 31.828375 well i have some small experience in this area the brown haze that you see if you look down Central towards downtown
sw3797B-ms98-a-0010 31.828375 44.682125 a lot of that is uh [noise] tied up with the oxides or nitrogen [noise] although some of the kind of bluish-gray stuff we see sometimes is tied up with particulates
sw3797B-ms98-a-0011 44.682125 56.251625 but uh the one of the major problems that Dallas has i[s]- is oxides and nitrogen that's because of all the equipment that's being operated but at the same time [noise]
sw3797B-ms98-a-0012 56.251625 69.647625 uh because we don't have we don't burn a lot of coal and solid materials we don't get a lot of particulates now particulates would come from trash burning or incineration or something like that here in Dallas
sw3797B-ms98-a-0013 69.647625 73.007750 uh power plants since [noise]
sw3797B-ms98-a-0014 73.007750 78.282125 many of our local power plants uh are natural gas most of the time
sw3797B-ms98-a-0015 78.282125 88.335750 uh the things that come off of those plants are carbon dioxide and NOX there's no particulates in natural gas of course
sw3797B-ms98-a-0016 88.335750 98.688875 and we pick up a little bit of sulphur off some of these products we're burning fuel oil and a few other things but gasoline of course now that lead's out at least theoretically
sw3797B-ms98-a-0017 98.688875 101.087625 uh [noise]
sw3797B-ms98-a-0018 101.087625 111.867125 uh i guess you could say we're picking up some sulphur because a lot of the fuels does have sulphur that's why we get that rotten egg smell sometime off the catalytic converter there's a little sulphur yes
sw3797B-ms98-a-0019 111.867125 124.609750 and that's uh course hydrogen sulfide which is when you burn gasoline you also produce some water vapor and that goes back in with your sulphur and you under the right condition you get H2S
sw3797B-ms98-a-0020 124.609750 127.024375 but anyway uh
sw3797B-ms98-a-0021 127.024375 128.032375 [silence]
sw3797B-ms98-a-0022 128.032375 130.150375 well i don't know but
sw3797B-ms98-a-0023 130.150375 137.802750 [silence]
sw3797B-ms98-a-0024 137.802750 139.358750 um-hum [noise]
sw3797B-ms98-a-0025 139.358750 143.950250 [silence]
sw3797B-ms98-a-0026 143.950250 152.493875 [noise] Ro[n]- uh Ron a lot of this is caused by the fact that cars sitting in traffic tend to run rich because of the way the pollution is
sw3797B-ms98-a-0027 152.493875 156.291250 and when they run rich they they spit out a lot of hydrocarbons
sw3797B-ms98-a-0028 156.291250 159.062250 and that's another part of the problem
sw3797B-ms98-a-0029 159.062250 162.980250 the gas is not being burned completely
sw3797B-ms98-a-0030 162.980250 165.563250 [noise] but um
sw3797B-ms98-a-0031 165.563250 170.301625 i[f]- hopefully if we ever get our road system fixed up this will get a lot better
sw3797B-ms98-a-0032 170.301625 176.051625 [silence]
sw3797B-ms98-a-0033 176.051625 177.556125 [laughter]
sw3797B-ms98-a-0034 177.556125 179.719750 [silence]
sw3797B-ms98-a-0035 179.719750 192.254750 [noise] well i- i guess i not trying to top you but i grew up in Dallas county and i can remember when they built the north part of North Central which was built after the south part of of Central
sw3797B-ms98-a-0036 192.254750 198.433000 and uh i can remember coming over the hill down there long about um [noise]
sw3797B-ms98-a-0037 198.433000 203.759000 i don't know little bit north of Mock[ingbird]- Mockingbird on up in over those hills
sw3797B-ms98-a-0038 203.759000 209.570375 and i said i wonder if they'll ever need this road [laughter]
sw3797B-ms98-a-0039 209.570375 223.955125 [noise] course it was designed for most of us to go about forty five miles an hour because the short on ramps and [ar[f]-/off] off ramps but [noise] gosh seems like uh those ramps might kill us yet i hopefully the new ones will be a lot better
sw3797B-ms98-a-0040 223.955125 226.008750 [silence]
sw3797B-ms98-a-0041 226.008750 228.324750 [noise] [vocalized-noise]
sw3797B-ms98-a-0042 228.324750 237.409000 [silence]
sw3797B-ms98-a-0043 237.409000 238.538125 um-hum
sw3797B-ms98-a-0044 238.538125 251.010500 [silence]
sw3797B-ms98-a-0045 251.010500 259.535125 yeah [noise] Ron have you noticed when you're driving south on thirty five i guess towards Waxahachie Hillsborough on down to Austin [noise]
sw3797B-ms98-a-0046 259.535125 271.568500 [noise] you hit a point down there about i think where they call Bear Creek exit right just this side of the county line [noise] right along in there somewhere suddenly the air feels cleaner
sw3797B-ms98-a-0047 271.568500 273.479875 have you noticed that
sw3797B-ms98-a-0048 273.479875 280.377750 [silence]
sw3797B-ms98-a-0049 280.377750 287.409750 well sometimes it depends on which way the winds blowing but uh i also travel a little bit and uh
sw3797B-ms98-a-0050 287.409750 295.257375 i don't know it just seems like there's a certain point down there where you can breathe easier it may be all in my mind [laughter]
sw3797B-ms98-a-0051 295.257375 298.146000 [silence]
