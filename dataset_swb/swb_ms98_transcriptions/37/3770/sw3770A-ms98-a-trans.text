sw3770A-ms98-a-0022 94.064375 96.874125 and uh i think a lot of people struggle with
sw3770A-ms98-a-0023 96.874125 103.630875 uh i guess the problem is that the spouse of whoever you know the parent is
sw3770A-ms98-a-0024 103.630875 108.598000 doesn't always want the in-law living in the house is that right

sw3770A-ms98-a-0036 154.436375 156.576875 yes well i know when the
sw3770A-ms98-a-0037 156.576875 162.918750 i remember being a child and my grandmother had had [noise] se[veral]- several strokes and things and that we had
sw3770A-ms98-a-0038 162.918750 173.105750 my parents tried to keep her in the house and they did for a long time i couldn't tell you how long until she got uh where she had to have complete care
sw3770A-ms98-a-0039 173.105750 181.181500 and j[ust]- they couldn't you know keep her in the house anymore and it was really hard on everyone that she had to have you know twenty four hour a day care
sw3770A-ms98-a-0040 181.181500 189.205750 and i don't remember much about it except that there was a nursing home at that time just a block or two from our house
sw3770A-ms98-a-0041 189.205750 195.366000 and that um they put her there and we all went just constantly until she died
sw3770A-ms98-a-0042 195.366000 199.646750 but it was very hard on everyone to see
sw3770A-ms98-a-0043 199.646750 202.414250 w[ell]- you know grandmother be like that
sw3770A-ms98-a-0044 202.414250 207.037375 and i don't know that you know [laughter] i don't being so young i don't remember why
sw3770A-ms98-a-0045 207.037375 210.959250 you know what was why she had to go there
sw3770A-ms98-a-0046 210.959250 219.220375 [silence]
sw3770A-ms98-a-0047 219.220375 230.436625 um-hum well i do remember that she was you know totally incapable of taking care of herself in any way and that that they couldn't they found that they could not you know give her
sw3770A-ms98-a-0048 230.436625 234.060000 the hygienic care and everything that she needed
sw3770A-ms98-a-0049 234.060000 242.999875 [silence]
sw3770A-ms98-a-0050 242.999875 252.892125 no but like you say there is a tendency for people to be abandoned though you know in the nursing home i do remember the other patients there um
sw3770A-ms98-a-0051 252.892125 259.036875 being real excited when we came to see our own grandmother because they got some interaction with someone
sw3770A-ms98-a-0052 259.036875 266.636375 [silence]
sw3770A-ms98-a-0053 266.636375 267.992500 um-hum

sw3770A-ms98-a-0056 270.549625 275.262375 right and i guess that's hard on people to give
sw3770A-ms98-a-0057 275.262375 283.833750 give up their lives if they're busy they don't you know it's easy to abandon people because we do have the nursing homes i guess
sw3770A-ms98-a-0058 283.833750 285.379500 if you can afford them_1
sw3770A-ms98-a-0059 285.379500 286.808875 but
sw3770A-ms98-a-0060 286.808875 291.041750 anyway well i'm glad it worked out good for your family
