sw3714B-ms98-a-0007 42.001125 54.623750 i think that had we had the war or had we not had the war we'd a had a lot similar uh effect upon the population in terms of the the freedom era as it were
sw3714B-ms98-a-0008 54.623750 65.824375 i think what we saw was a phenomenon of a large number of young people at one time that were of the age of decision without the maturity to handle it

sw3714B-ms98-a-0023 149.261750 158.431875 well i think one of the the major points that a lot of people including myself missed until recently is the fact that
sw3714B-ms98-a-0024 158.431875 161.970125 we could have annihilated
sw3714B-ms98-a-0025 161.970125 164.770250 the north had we wanted to
sw3714B-ms98-a-0026 164.770250 171.989000 [silence]
sw3714B-ms98-a-0027 171.989000 179.619250 well even even at even at the not on the you know the gross tactical but on the on the very minute tactical arena
sw3714B-ms98-a-0028 179.619250 184.637000 you know they were sending out you know eight or nine guys to engage a company
sw3714B-ms98-a-0029 184.637000 189.344000 you know and they'd get wiped out you wonder why you know and
sw3714B-ms98-a-0030 189.344000 202.775625 at every turn the tacticians were denied access to information which is a biggie and uh components you know whatever it took to do the job by the politicians
sw3714B-ms98-a-0031 202.775625 210.620500 why because somebody was getting rich i found that everywhere you look if you find the money you'll find out why
sw3714B-ms98-a-0032 210.620500 219.711250 and Dow Chemical had a real good thing going you know Dow Chemical had a photographer at every demonstration
sw3714B-ms98-a-0033 219.711250 225.441500 yes and if your picture was in that demonstration you didn't get hired by Dow Chemical
sw3714B-ms98-a-0034 225.441500 227.084000 yeah
sw3714B-ms98-a-0035 227.084000 232.788500 and uh DuPont was was uh doing a lot of that too

sw3714B-ms98-a-0041 249.526875 263.794500 [silence]
sw3714B-ms98-a-0042 263.794500 266.093500 they have no moral conscience
sw3714B-ms98-a-0043 266.093500 278.034000 and that goes into and it and it's all tied together too i kind of believe that the Vietnam event i'm not gonna call it a war or a police action it was an event
sw3714B-ms98-a-0044 278.034000 280.411250 that the main
sw3714B-ms98-a-0045 280.411250 287.765875 push for that was outside the United States our involvement for one thing we were on the wrong side
sw3714B-ms98-a-0046 287.765875 294.637875 you know we were on the side of the fascist dictator and you know Ho Chi Minh if you've read any of his writings he was a democrat
sw3714B-ms98-a-0047 294.637875 296.790625 you know he wanted democracy
sw3714B-ms98-a-0048 296.790625 299.522000 but he was forced to sleep with
