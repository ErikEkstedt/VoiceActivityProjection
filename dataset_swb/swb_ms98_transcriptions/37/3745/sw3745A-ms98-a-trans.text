sw3745A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.181375 [noise]
sw3745A-ms98-a-0002 0.181375 4.832000 um serious problems in the public education and what can be done about it
sw3745A-ms98-a-0003 4.832000 6.774875 um
sw3745A-ms98-a-0004 6.774875 16.918500 well i that's funny because i just um quit my job to stay home with my kids and um i was a teacher for seven years in the public schools
sw3745A-ms98-a-0005 16.918500 21.465375 so i know a little bit about it not a whole great deal
sw3745A-ms98-a-0006 21.465375 22.983250 [laughter]
sw3745A-ms98-a-0007 22.983250 24.437500 [silence]
sw3745A-ms98-a-0008 24.437500 30.309125 well um there there's some there's several [laughter] it's such a a broad
sw3745A-ms98-a-0009 30.309125 36.095375 you know topic that y[ou]- y[ou]- you need to boil it down but um one that um
sw3745A-ms98-a-0010 36.095375 46.926625 i thought was a problem that it's a it i thought it was a serious problem that i'm not sure it's being taken care of right now uh was like bilingual education
sw3745A-ms98-a-0011 46.926625 59.338875 for um different um minority groups and like Asians and um uh Mexican Americans and and just people in general that speak other languages that
sw3745A-ms98-a-0012 59.338875 66.236875 sometimes come from other countries or coming from different areas and they and in this area and
sw3745A-ms98-a-0013 66.236875 79.714875 um as the school district i'm not sure how to go about it because it's hard to get one teacher that speaks all these language and so most of these children are put in um either special ed or a bilingual program
sw3745A-ms98-a-0014 79.714875 93.451250 and then for just a small amount of time and then they're into their regular classrooms the remaining of the part of the day and so the teachers are not sure how to teach them math when they don't read or speak
sw3745A-ms98-a-0015 93.451250 95.351000 English
sw3745A-ms98-a-0016 95.351000 103.835875 and so um a lot of the moneys isn't put into that and so these children are just kind of sat in the corner and um
sw3745A-ms98-a-0017 103.835875 112.681625 you know i[t]- there's only so long you can do that and to me that seemed like a big problem in the school districts and a lot of the teachers
sw3745A-ms98-a-0018 112.681625 124.190875 it n[ot]- it was not the teacher's fault a lot of the teachers were just not getting the backbone or support that they needed or the materials or the extra help that they needed for these specific children
sw3745A-ms98-a-0019 124.190875 125.298375 yeah

sw3745A-ms98-a-0037 234.968375 242.287875 well i know Richardson school district has a has a wonderful program in the remedial reading um where
sw3745A-ms98-a-0038 242.287875 248.436000 you know of course all the children are tested in some time at portion of the year and and uh
sw3745A-ms98-a-0039 248.436000 256.143625 some children who need extra help are put into this um reading program and it is just excellent it is i wish that
sw3745A-ms98-a-0040 256.143625 258.577000 all the children could be exposed to that program
sw3745A-ms98-a-0041 258.577000 268.754375 you know and then there i know that there are some parents that say how do i get my kids in that and yet they don't qualify but unfortunate that they don't qualify because i think everybody would benefit from these programs
sw3745A-ms98-a-0042 268.754375 271.564750 it is excellent so
sw3745A-ms98-a-0043 271.564750 272.621875 [silence]
sw3745A-ms98-a-0044 272.621875 283.272750 i have two little ones and that's why i i quit my job uh you know i've been teaching since they were gosh newborns and [noise] and it just wasn't adding up and you know
sw3745A-ms98-a-0045 283.272750 291.937750 being a teacher and you see all these parents who are working and working and working and just you know don't have the time time time time it was kind of getting to me where well i'm doing the same [laughter-thing]
