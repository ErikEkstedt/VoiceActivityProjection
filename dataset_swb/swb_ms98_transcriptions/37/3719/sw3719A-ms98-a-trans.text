sw3719A-ms98-a-0006 9.392125 15.267750 yeah the class sizes are too large and [noise] they don't pay the teachers enough
sw3719A-ms98-a-0007 15.267750 20.330625 [vocalized-noise] like in Dallas they have too many administrators they're top-heavy
sw3719A-ms98-a-0008 20.330625 26.033125 and uh they had yesterday on the news they had some problems with the
sw3719A-ms98-a-0009 26.033125 29.172750 the text
sw3719A-ms98-a-0010 29.172750 32.784375 having um mistakes in them_1
sw3719A-ms98-a-0011 32.784375 41.505750 and uh a lot of them_1 aren't like the history books aren't historically correct they they covered up a lot of the bad things that have happened
sw3719A-ms98-a-0012 41.505750 45.483875 [silence]
sw3719A-ms98-a-0013 45.483875 48.156125 well i think they need to
sw3719A-ms98-a-0014 48.156125 52.232125 do whatever they can like um i think
sw3719A-ms98-a-0015 52.232125 58.534000 um Massachusetts put a priority on education and and um
sw3719A-ms98-a-0016 58.534000 62.728250 bringing in industry and [noise] recruiting
sw3719A-ms98-a-0017 62.728250 69.172500 and they made a lot of difference in that state and in Texas i think we're like twenty ninth in spending
sw3719A-ms98-a-0018 69.172500 78.657125 you know and they put through this Robin Hood bill but it doesn't change the amount of spending overall it just distributes the money more evenly
sw3719A-ms98-a-0019 78.657125 89.580625 and so that they need to do that they need to increase spending they need to um make it so that the teachers want to stay in teaching because_1 most of the time the teachers spend
sw3719A-ms98-a-0020 89.580625 95.324875 disciplining the the kids instead of instead of teaching the subject now

sw3719A-ms98-a-0029 128.342375 140.990875 and uh i i think they changed the way the ladder is now that it takes [noise] a longer time f[or]- for you to qualify for a higher salary and uh it's it's um
sw3719A-ms98-a-0030 140.990875 145.483625 it's more subjective than it was before
sw3719A-ms98-a-0031 145.483625 147.073875 so

sw3719A-ms98-a-0054 231.021000 238.201000 and i and i don't know uh uh they cut back on the since Mark White passed that bill about
sw3719A-ms98-a-0055 238.201000 242.863625 cutting back on all the extracurricular activities that may have improved a little bit
sw3719A-ms98-a-0056 242.863625 244.747500 because um
sw3719A-ms98-a-0057 244.747500 251.940750 i was talking to a lady the other day and that that's the first thing she said her her both her children were in band and they'd quit
sw3719A-ms98-a-0058 251.940750 261.067000 and she said the band teacher acted like band was the only subject that he was taking and he was suppose to s[pend]- spend all of his time on band
sw3719A-ms98-a-0059 261.067000 268.447875 right and he he was taking honors classes in all his other subjects he goes to the Lewisville School District
sw3719A-ms98-a-0060 268.447875 273.382250 and uh you know it's just ridiculous so he just quit simple as that
