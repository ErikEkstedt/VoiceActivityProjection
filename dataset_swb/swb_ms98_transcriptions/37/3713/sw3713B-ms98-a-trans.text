sw3713B-ms98-a-0028 113.652250 117.639375 i was going to say i kind of i do not know i do
sw3713B-ms98-a-0029 117.639375 120.457250 odd things i guess
sw3713B-ms98-a-0030 120.457250 126.787375 um i guess last time i was home was at Christmas and i cooked um
sw3713B-ms98-a-0031 126.787375 133.130375 i bought some really good beef tenderloin at um Ralph's in Snider Plaza
sw3713B-ms98-a-0032 133.130375 145.451750 and um i had i my parents have a deep freeze so i bought like oh God i want to say it was like four pounds and put it in the deep freeze and so i cooked one of them you know and
sw3713B-ms98-a-0033 145.451750 149.092625 basically have you ever used that DV sauce
sw3713B-ms98-a-0034 149.092625 151.478250 it's like um
sw3713B-ms98-a-0035 151.478250 154.923125 a meat a beef enhancer or something like that
sw3713B-ms98-a-0036 154.923125 160.257875 i mean it might not i- i haven't really looked at the ingredients and it may be one of those things where if if
sw3713B-ms98-a-0037 160.257875 165.285500 it may have MSG in it i really haven't really looked i do not think it does but it might but
sw3713B-ms98-a-0038 165.285500 170.981250 uh you know i kind of like sprinkle some of that on it [noise] and then take like
sw3713B-ms98-a-0039 170.981250 175.746250 you know pieces of cloves of garlic and sort of push them_1 down into the meat
sw3713B-ms98-a-0040 175.746250 177.537875 [silence]
sw3713B-ms98-a-0041 177.537875 188.073125 and then yeah and then bake it you know and it it always turns out really good i mean course you know the better the the the quality of the meat the better it turns out but
sw3713B-ms98-a-0042 188.073125 202.447875 you know and if you can leave it out on the counter for a little bit and you know to soak in the the garlic and everything you know that works pretty well but you know that's kind of that's kind of basic and i can do some Chinese and junk like that but
sw3713B-ms98-a-0043 202.447875 203.777000 [silence]
sw3713B-ms98-a-0044 203.777000 211.872000 some sometimes um i had one but i loaned it to somebody and they never gave it back [laughter]
sw3713B-ms98-a-0045 211.872000 214.983500 so i kind of just use a skillet really
sw3713B-ms98-a-0046 214.983500 216.487375 [silence]
sw3713B-ms98-a-0047 216.487375 217.976000 oh yeah
sw3713B-ms98-a-0048 217.976000 225.412125 [silence]
sw3713B-ms98-a-0049 225.412125 235.830125 sure and the easy see now that would be an easy thing to do for the dinner party because you could do that in advance you know you i would just get like um
sw3713B-ms98-a-0050 235.830125 247.992750 you could use do chicken or beef either one and you know kind of chop it up into about inch cubes you know and the marinade i think that is like um
sw3713B-ms98-a-0051 247.992750 255.155250 oh like a cup of water and maybe three tablespoons of
sw3713B-ms98-a-0052 255.155250 257.111750 [silence]
sw3713B-ms98-a-0053 257.111750 265.550125 soy and one tablespoon of Lea and Perrins or Worc[estershire]- Worcestershire Worc[estershire]- or whatever sauce i can't pronounce it 
sw3713B-ms98-a-0054 265.550125 279.539875 i always call it Lea and Perrins because_1 i can't say the name of it and uh garlic and chopped green onions and then you know chop up all of your meat like the night before and stick it in a tupperware dish with the
sw3713B-ms98-a-0055 279.539875 287.995125 you know with the stuff and let it marinade over night and then just strain out you know the juice and um
sw3713B-ms98-a-0056 287.995125 297.770500 you know then then you know stir fry the meat and um you can get the cans of sliced water chestnuts and bamboo shoots and
sw3713B-ms98-a-0057 297.770500 299.330000 you can put mushroom
