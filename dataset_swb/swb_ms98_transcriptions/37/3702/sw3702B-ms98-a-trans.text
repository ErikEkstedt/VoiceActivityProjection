sw3702B-ms98-a-0003 6.189625 10.904875 i'm not too happy about the idea although
sw3702B-ms98-a-0004 10.904875 20.970625 i do realize that sometimes it becomes necessary to do that or to have round the clock kind of hea[lth]- care available in the house
sw3702B-ms98-a-0005 20.970625 32.287125 which often is is not that um easy to to do sometimes it really is easier to put the person right in the central place where the care can be given
sw3702B-ms98-a-0006 32.287125 40.718000 i'm very happy that in my life so far i have not had to do that kind of a thing um
sw3702B-ms98-a-0007 40.718000 52.694750 my own mother lived with us for some years and uh just died peacefully within a short amount of time at the end of her life and uh i never had to face that personally
sw3702B-ms98-a-0008 52.694750 57.761375 and uh what do you think you might do in such a situation
sw3702B-ms98-a-0009 57.761375 59.664500 [silence]
sw3702B-ms98-a-0010 59.664500 60.442625 um-hum

sw3702B-ms98-a-0016 75.352125 76.789625 oh
sw3702B-ms98-a-0017 76.789625 84.726625 [silence]
sw3702B-ms98-a-0018 84.726625 86.587250 oh yes
sw3702B-ms98-a-0019 86.587250 91.279375 [silence]
sw3702B-ms98-a-0020 91.279375 92.888875 i see
sw3702B-ms98-a-0021 92.888875 97.895125 [silence]

sw3702B-ms98-a-0025 114.014625 127.582875 [silence]
sw3702B-ms98-a-0026 127.582875 129.987500 that's right um-hum
sw3702B-ms98-a-0027 129.987500 140.086000 yeah people are just not as home as much as they used to be um sometimes persons are still working and are not retired yet and
sw3702B-ms98-a-0028 140.086000 154.773500 um and therefore uh they have to leave the older person all the by themselves or with the care of somebody else and some of the diseases that uh older people have uh do require more intensive surveillance
sw3702B-ms98-a-0029 154.773500 159.482375 so uh it it isn't easy i suppose one of the
sw3702B-ms98-a-0030 159.482375 172.225125 uh best things if you are considering a nursing home is to inquire among friends and get personal recommendations i know i always trust the opinion of a
sw3702B-ms98-a-0031 172.225125 181.718875 close friend uh above just what i might read about a place if somebody i knew and cared about liked a place and said no this was good and
sw3702B-ms98-a-0032 181.718875 188.026750 we were happy about the personnel and the care et cetera and so forth i would it certainly would go up in my estimation
sw3702B-ms98-a-0033 188.026750 200.823000 and uh sometimes we as you said don't know a lot about where we are putting somebody that we care about and it's hard to know what the best uh place is um-hum

sw3702B-ms98-a-0050 258.690625 262.433375 yeah what part of California is that
sw3702B-ms98-a-0051 262.433375 273.847500 oh i see we used to live out there in the San Jose area so uh you know i'm kind of familiar with the state of California and like it very much yeah
sw3702B-ms98-a-0052 273.847500 283.739125 but um uh it's uh it's a difficult situation uh sometimes also when you get involved in the
sw3702B-ms98-a-0053 283.739125 293.338250 in those residences for the elderly the retirement homes and and also uh maybe even the nursing division of a residence home
sw3702B-ms98-a-0054 293.338250 299.042000 um it's tremendously expensive and sometimes they ask you to uh
