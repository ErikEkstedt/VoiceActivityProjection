sw3702A-ms98-a-0012 55.966500 65.541125 yeah oh i agree i it's it's a tough issue i feel like each case probably has to be evaluated individually i feel um
sw3702A-ms98-a-0013 65.541125 71.216875 i- i feel like as families you know we need to take care of the older ones in our families
sw3702A-ms98-a-0014 71.216875 78.910000 and yet i understand um well we may be facing that with my grandmother she li[ves]- is living near my parents out in California 
sw3702A-ms98-a-0015 78.910000 87.075125 and they this year they moved her into a um retirement apartment complex so she's got part time care 
sw3702A-ms98-a-0016 87.075125 99.661875 but as soon as she needs round the clock care then she's not allowed to live there anymore and so we'll have to face the issue of whether she moves in with my mother or they put her into a nursing home and 
sw3702A-ms98-a-0017 99.661875 105.819250 it's it's difficult because i know my mother feels really um torn about it she doesn't want to
sw3702A-ms98-a-0018 105.819250 114.992625 to put her in a place where she's gonna be unhappy lonely or where there's bad care and sometimes you just don't know what the the place is like um
sw3702A-ms98-a-0019 114.992625 118.933750 i mean you really need to get recommendations i guess from others and
sw3702A-ms98-a-0020 118.933750 131.194000 um and yet it's a real burden to her to have to to be there all the time or else you know or else like you said you have to hire someone to be in the home it's a tough issue

sw3702A-ms98-a-0036 198.886000 203.129375 yeah [noise] i uh i was thinking you know it might
sw3702A-ms98-a-0037 203.129375 214.041750 i guess i would want to visit the place quite a bit before or something and and talk to the staff see what their attitudes are talk to some of the people that live there and see how they feel about being there
sw3702A-ms98-a-0038 214.041750 221.668750 um because i've been in different nursing homes where i've sensed different atmospheres you know often it's it's been negative where the
sw3702A-ms98-a-0039 221.668750 233.872875 and i know that partly it can be the attitude of the person if they they feel neglected by their family or whatever or they just feel ready to die and you know tired of feeling not feeling good all the time
sw3702A-ms98-a-0040 233.872875 245.604000 then they're not gonna feel too good but then i've i've been to other places where you know the people have told me um this is a really good place the people here really care about us so
