sw3790A-ms98-a-0014 63.498625 75.414125 and so a lot of people like the 49ers because_1 Steve Young plays for them uh Jim McMahon plays for the Chicago Bears so they cheered for him you know when he played for them but he kind of got to be a jerk so nobody liked him anyway but
sw3790A-ms98-a-0015 75.414125 82.171000 uh a lot of 49ers i think uh more than anything i guess but uh

sw3790A-ms98-a-0063 258.310500 266.695500 yeah in fact that's that was our whole reason for cheering this year because_1 that uh Ty Detmer was from Texas down there and that's that's who i follow quite a bit is BYU but
sw3790A-ms98-a-0064 266.695500 279.510750 and so we were kind of prejudiced towards him good or bad or whatever anybody thinks but yeah they seem that he just from what he was saying his dad was a coach his brother was into it i mean that just seemed like a lot of people were involved kind of like Indiana and basketball or something
sw3790A-ms98-a-0065 279.510750 284.044375 [silence]
sw3790A-ms98-a-0066 284.044375 294.287375 oh really that'll be interesting see i know uh he's he been recruited pretty heavily he's not sure if he wants to follow in his brother's footsteps and go to the Y i wouldn't do it if i were him
sw3790A-ms98-a-0067 294.287375 297.186000 boy if he doesn't live up to that at least his brother's expecta[tions]-
