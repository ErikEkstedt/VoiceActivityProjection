sw3743B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.703375 [noise] 
sw3743B-ms98-a-0002 0.703375 6.083875 [silence] 
sw3743B-ms98-a-0003 6.083875 8.488750 well of course working
sw3743B-ms98-a-0004 8.488750 14.452125 that's definitely got [laughter-to] [laughter-be] the biggest thing is that everybody's out there working
sw3743B-ms98-a-0005 14.452125 18.351000 including me [laughter] well what do you think it is
sw3743B-ms98-a-0006 18.351000 19.477375 [silence]
sw3743B-ms98-a-0007 19.477375 20.916000 yeah
sw3743B-ms98-a-0008 20.916000 24.904250 [silence]
sw3743B-ms98-a-0009 24.904250 27.980500 yes they do yeah they do
sw3743B-ms98-a-0010 27.980500 31.359625 [silence]
sw3743B-ms98-a-0011 31.359625 32.914125 right
sw3743B-ms98-a-0012 32.914125 35.194500 uh-huh yeah
sw3743B-ms98-a-0013 35.194500 36.216625 [silence]
sw3743B-ms98-a-0014 36.216625 42.410875 yeah that's true it's a big change i'm an OB nurse and so i really do see what you're saying there [noise]
sw3743B-ms98-a-0015 42.410875 48.488875 it used to be that our list ran nineteen twenty twenty one for our patients' ages
sw3743B-ms98-a-0016 48.488875 61.878750 and now our care plans look more like thirty two thirty three if we get somebody twenty one we go oh look how young so yeah you're right there's a big change and we have a lot of first time moms in their late thirties and even forties
sw3743B-ms98-a-0017 61.878750 69.574250 so that's true but again i guess it probably does go back to the same thing of women having careers
sw3743B-ms98-a-0018 69.574250 74.051250 if they didn't have if they weren't out there working and having their careers
sw3743B-ms98-a-0019 74.051250 81.427375 they probably would be married and having their children [laughter] so [laughter] i guess it's a combination
sw3743B-ms98-a-0020 81.427375 83.393000 no go on
sw3743B-ms98-a-0021 83.393000 86.565500 [silence]
sw3743B-ms98-a-0022 86.565500 88.043500 yeah
sw3743B-ms98-a-0023 88.043500 92.383375 [silence]
sw3743B-ms98-a-0024 92.383375 100.172125 yeah yeah yeah there's a lot of mixed up families that's for [laughter-sure] yeah
sw3743B-ms98-a-0025 100.172125 105.157750 [silence]
sw3743B-ms98-a-0026 105.157750 108.180875 well just that i think the families
sw3743B-ms98-a-0027 108.180875 113.975000 the the role in the family and the mother doesn't stay home and cook the dinner take care of the children
sw3743B-ms98-a-0028 113.975000 123.839625 um we do it all [laughter] i really think that and i know that there's a lot more participation by the fathers but i still think the mothers
sw3743B-ms98-a-0029 123.839625 128.170375 have the major role i really do i think they're just
sw3743B-ms98-a-0030 128.170375 139.622875 they're not doing very much less i don't think as far as the kids and and the house and everything are concerned not from what i see and and they're contributing to the income besides
sw3743B-ms98-a-0031 139.622875 144.361375 i think that we're really really putting a lot of stress on ourselves
sw3743B-ms98-a-0032 144.361375 147.682500 [silence]
sw3743B-ms98-a-0033 147.682500 149.193625 oh it is
sw3743B-ms98-a-0034 149.193625 157.587000 [silence]
sw3743B-ms98-a-0035 157.587000 159.102750 yeah
sw3743B-ms98-a-0036 159.102750 160.909375 [silence]
sw3743B-ms98-a-0037 160.909375 166.804750 yeah it's it's difficult and i think that i live in Plano actually so
sw3743B-ms98-a-0038 166.804750 178.839000 [laughter] it's very wealthy town and we're not part of that but i [laughter] it is you know and i think what i see a lot of parents a lot of mothers working just for bigger and better
sw3743B-ms98-a-0039 178.839000 184.613750 and i really hate that you know i hate to see that an[d]- and i've been here for a very long time
sw3743B-ms98-a-0040 184.613750 186.437375 but um
sw3743B-ms98-a-0041 186.437375 191.282625 i don't know now i'm a single parent and i don't have a choice anymore but
sw3743B-ms98-a-0042 191.282625 201.571500 i used to just work occasionally for extra money but now i have to work all the time and that's really hard and and i don't know how a mother does just choose to go out to work and
sw3743B-ms98-a-0043 201.571500 212.717000 and leave the kids in a way it's good it's very good to get out with adults and i think that's a good thing if you can do it part time but to just go out there forty hours a week at least and
sw3743B-ms98-a-0044 212.717000 218.883500 and work and and leave your kids to get home from school alone and that kind of thing i think that's
sw3743B-ms98-a-0045 218.883500 223.982875 not very smart i think that's difficult on them_1 so
sw3743B-ms98-a-0046 223.982875 226.709375 [silence]
sw3743B-ms98-a-0047 226.709375 237.512500 well it's gonna be interesting i yeah i think it will change but i'm not sure how it's going to because i see young people today and wonder how in the world they'll ever afford
sw3743B-ms98-a-0048 237.512500 242.332250 to buy a home and and to raise a family i don't know how they're gonna do it
sw3743B-ms98-a-0049 242.332250 250.981875 and so i don't know how it can change to where the mother can get back into the home again i don't think that ever will go backwards
sw3743B-ms98-a-0050 250.981875 257.821375 but i don't know what effect it's gonna have on these kids now when they grow up how they're gonna feel about it
sw3743B-ms98-a-0051 257.821375 271.093000 it you know it could lead to another [laughter-Woodstock] [laughter-type] [laughter-thing] you know where where there's just too much material things and and maybe these kids will really resent that their parents are out there working for things
sw3743B-ms98-a-0052 271.093000 279.000875 and they might wanna do without things rather than do that to their families it's hard to say
sw3743B-ms98-a-0053 279.000875 289.955750 [silence]
sw3743B-ms98-a-0054 289.955750 291.704250 uh-huh
sw3743B-ms98-a-0055 291.704250 296.866000 [silence]
