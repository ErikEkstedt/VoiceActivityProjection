sw3720B-ms98-a-0002 1.095875 7.424125 [silence]
sw3720B-ms98-a-0003 7.424125 14.300750 okay um we have an eleven year old an eight year old and a three year old and um
sw3720B-ms98-a-0004 14.300750 25.031375 uh my husband let's see he coaches basketball with Brian um so he spends time doing that with him planning and um practicing out side
sw3720B-ms98-a-0005 25.031375 36.145375 um he's a real sports kind of person so he plays tennis with with the kids we all kind of play tennis as a family except the baby plays on the play ground we take turns with her um
sw3720B-ms98-a-0006 36.145375 42.597000 uh let's see we have a computer and we do a lot of things with the kids on the computer um
sw3720B-ms98-a-0007 42.597000 55.440250 uh let's see what else we do oh i suppose we watch a little TV together we really don't watch i think as much TV as a lot of people we don't have HBO we do get the Disney channel for the kids
sw3720B-ms98-a-0008 55.440250 60.656500 uh my kids have the Nintendo which they play and my husband sometimes joins them_1 with that
sw3720B-ms98-a-0009 60.656500 67.553625 uh my little girl Jennifer likes to do crafty things and i'll take some time and do that with her
sw3720B-ms98-a-0010 67.553625 75.810125 and of course we always read a bed time story at night and even the the older kids sometimes sit down and and will join in and listen to a story um
sw3720B-ms98-a-0011 75.810125 87.356750 basically the story person because_1 my husband doesn't have he gets home from work late or whatever and and usually once in a while he'll read the story to the little one but that's basically my [laughter-job] um
sw3720B-ms98-a-0012 87.356750 88.590125 [silence]
sw3720B-ms98-a-0013 88.590125 99.096125 [noise] it is it is hard because you know at the end of your day you want time for yourself and and it and that's kind of cutting into your your time
sw3720B-ms98-a-0014 99.096125 111.151875 and with the kids getting older now on the weekends they get to the bed like at ten which really is late but you know on school nights the two older ones get to bed about nine they go upstairs at nine
sw3720B-ms98-a-0015 111.151875 122.354125 and um now this weekend we'll have a baby sitter come and uh my husband and i will go out to dinner and come home and um probably not too late may[be]- maybe Brian will still be up and
sw3720B-ms98-a-0016 122.354125 131.659125 spend some time with him but it is it's really hard you have to be a very unselfish person to to spend a lot of time with your kids i think
sw3720B-ms98-a-0017 131.659125 145.719625 uh no i don't work i last year um i had a little part time job in a private um high school tutoring um high school students with learning disabilities that was two days a week and even just those two days
sw3720B-ms98-a-0018 145.719625 156.433625 just seemed like it was a lot i don't know how i admire people that that can do it all but with three kids and laundry and keeping the house the way i i want it kept it is hard
sw3720B-ms98-a-0019 156.433625 167.082000 um even just finding the time to do the grocery shopping and everything and that's another thing i'll take one of the kids with me grocery shopping um usually on the weekend and
sw3720B-ms98-a-0020 167.082000 181.783250 that's kind of like a special time for just myself and my little girl or myself and my son and and they'll be my helper and then they'll get to pick out some of the favorite snacks that they get to pick out so try to do things like that but it you know it's it's uh
sw3720B-ms98-a-0021 181.783250 189.019500 and then of course they have a pretty um busy social calendar too [laughter] you fit it in with all that the that
sw3720B-ms98-a-0022 189.019500 193.328625 [silence]
sw3720B-ms98-a-0023 193.328625 200.371500 i i think a lot of people a lot of people sit sit their kids in front of the TV and HBO and rent movies and and
sw3720B-ms98-a-0024 200.371500 214.001375 kind of leave them to their own means um i think you know it's very very easy to fall into that trap and i'm not um totally innocent of that because there's times when you just stay here watch a tape but um
sw3720B-ms98-a-0025 214.001375 225.444500 um i think different parts of the country i think in Plano and maybe this area in Texas there's a lot of community activities that parents could join in with their kids people are real
sw3720B-ms98-a-0026 225.444500 233.434500 sports conscious and really get involved with their kids sports activities and you know but um
sw3720B-ms98-a-0027 233.434500 236.700500 [silence]
sw3720B-ms98-a-0028 236.700500 239.431000 what um-hum
sw3720B-ms98-a-0029 239.431000 241.963625 [silence]
sw3720B-ms98-a-0030 241.963625 251.096125 um-hum and it's it's very hard because when you get used to two salaries it's very hard to to cut back to one and um um
sw3720B-ms98-a-0031 251.096125 264.615375 but you know if you have the type of job i have a friend that's a nurse and she can pick her hours and that's a a great career i i wish i would have gone into uh nursing [laughter] because she has such a flexible schedule but it's very hard to uh
sw3720B-ms98-a-0032 264.615375 268.471750 spend time with the children and uh and your husband and
sw3720B-ms98-a-0033 268.471750 270.505500 do everything at once
sw3720B-ms98-a-0034 270.505500 274.867000 [silence]
sw3720B-ms98-a-0035 274.867000 282.430625 well i think it's a big it's a big um responsibility you just don't have children so that you can continue the lifestyle you had when you were single
sw3720B-ms98-a-0036 282.430625 293.047750 when you have children you have to say now this is different and you do have to give things up i i personally feel that it is extremely important to be with your own child um
sw3720B-ms98-a-0037 293.047750 299.522000 for the at least for the first two years of their lives i mean if you can possibly swing it because they
