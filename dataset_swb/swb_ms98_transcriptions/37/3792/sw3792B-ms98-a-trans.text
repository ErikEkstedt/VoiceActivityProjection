sw3792B-ms98-a-0036 167.663625 169.316000 [silence]
sw3792B-ms98-a-0037 169.316000 170.480250 yeah

sw3792B-ms98-a-0039 179.252125 191.656375 we were kind of timid about it an[d]- because_1 we'd we'd a[ll]- we'd all had dogs as kids and lost them_1 or something and [noise] and [noise] we d[o]- we were afraid to but he kind of rooted his way in
sw3792B-ms98-a-0040 191.656375 197.116875 and -[h]ey i know at times when he's had emergency problems we're just a nervous wreck
sw3792B-ms98-a-0041 197.116875 201.978250 so that's that's part of being a pet owner these days [noise]
sw3792B-ms98-a-0042 201.978250 208.951250 and i don't know but cats i don't know you can have a cat in the apartment couldn't you
sw3792B-ms98-a-0043 208.951250 210.973000 oh
sw3792B-ms98-a-0044 210.973000 217.272875 [silence]

sw3792B-ms98-a-0047 221.230625 229.726500 um we never had much luck with cats we had some when we lived in New Mexico and coyotes ate them_1 [noise] so
sw3792B-ms98-a-0048 229.726500 240.005500 we were kind of timid about having cats and again plus we we found out that when they were kittens we really liked them_1 and as they got older they kind of ignored us
sw3792B-ms98-a-0049 240.005500 242.229875 so
sw3792B-ms98-a-0050 242.229875 245.460125 but with a dog they don't do that
sw3792B-ms98-a-0051 245.460125 248.913125 when i was a kid i i raised parakeets
sw3792B-ms98-a-0052 248.913125 257.072125 so those were i always thought those were good pets to have extremely messy [laughter] but
sw3792B-ms98-a-0053 257.072125 262.481375 [silence]
sw3792B-ms98-a-0054 262.481375 269.801500 yeah th[ey're]- they're fun but i like to look at fish one of our favorite restaurants here in town
sw3792B-ms98-a-0055 269.801500 278.507750 has a humongous fish tank and i like to go there just uh the food's not that great but a fish tank's wonderful to look at them_1 you know floating around
sw3792B-ms98-a-0056 278.507750 285.568000 matter fact we got two dogs fighting right now [noise] [laughter-yeah]
sw3792B-ms98-a-0057 285.568000 287.324625 [silence]
sw3792B-ms98-a-0058 287.324625 294.800875 yeah -[w]ell there's enough people here actually the pit bull is from Dallas he lives up he lives up there but they're down visiting and
sw3792B-ms98-a-0059 294.800875 298.242000 so it's kind of unusual to have two dogs in the house
