sw3726B-ms98-a-0003 4.944875 11.679875 that was in Japan uh i didn't get to see that uh we've uh just gotten back yesterday from vacation
sw3726B-ms98-a-0004 11.679875 20.355750 and so i was bumping up and down the highway in a camper and uh i didn't get to watch any television so i've just been finding out about this once i got back
sw3726B-ms98-a-0005 20.355750 33.623875 [silence]
sw3726B-ms98-a-0006 33.623875 35.369000 [laughter]
sw3726B-ms98-a-0007 35.369000 42.142750 [silence]
sw3726B-ms98-a-0008 42.142750 55.499375 yeah well i was kind of pleased that uh when i got back that that was the hot item on the news that uh the President had fainted at dinner because_1 that means that nothing else happened anywhere in the world [laughter]
sw3726B-ms98-a-0009 55.499375 62.549250 [silence]
sw3726B-ms98-a-0010 62.549250 69.704375 yeah well you need about three kids running around the house and uh you you'd have your share of health problem too [laughter]
sw3726B-ms98-a-0011 69.704375 80.788500 [silence]
sw3726B-ms98-a-0012 80.788500 82.126125 yeah
sw3726B-ms98-a-0013 82.126125 83.312500 [silence]
sw3726B-ms98-a-0014 83.312500 89.552125 well i think the key issue that's going on at the moment is the current economy 
sw3726B-ms98-a-0015 89.552125 98.353875 and i think there's a lot of things that need to be done to to rectify that situation i'm not sure that the government is the key player
sw3726B-ms98-a-0016 98.353875 100.126875 um
sw3726B-ms98-a-0017 100.126875 101.477000 [silence]
sw3726B-ms98-a-0018 101.477000 107.610875 i think one of the statements that was made uh a year ago by uh Gorbachev
sw3726B-ms98-a-0019 107.610875 119.644500 when he was announcing some of the problems that existed in the Soviet Union he made the comment he said well our country may be bankrupt but referring to the United States he says your schools are bankrupt
sw3726B-ms98-a-0020 119.644500 123.711250 and uh that's been a big concern for me
sw3726B-ms98-a-0021 123.711250 132.110000 and i noticed that uh when i go into the tougher courses at some of the universities like Organic Chemistry or something like that
sw3726B-ms98-a-0022 132.110000 140.438250 that uh you don't find very many white American males taking the tough courses
sw3726B-ms98-a-0023 140.438250 147.704250 you find you find a lot of Asian students uh you find uh a lot of females in the class
sw3726B-ms98-a-0024 147.704250 158.805875 and in all of the tough courses that i have taken the only blacks that i've found in the class have have generally been from Nigeria or some other African country they're foreign students
sw3726B-ms98-a-0025 158.805875 162.087250 and it's i think it's kind of pathetic that uh
sw3726B-ms98-a-0026 162.087250 165.425500 our kids are not motivated to uh
sw3726B-ms98-a-0027 165.425500 176.907750 to study in depth and uh to take the hard courses and i'm i'm concerned that that is our economic problem not not how much money is being spent at Christmas time
sw3726B-ms98-a-0028 176.907750 199.516625 [silence]
sw3726B-ms98-a-0029 199.516625 200.873375 um-hum
sw3726B-ms98-a-0030 200.873375 212.082500 [silence]
sw3726B-ms98-a-0031 212.082500 224.232125 yeah well i know when i went through school uh i went through an engineering school and of all my close friends they were all there because they loved engineering
sw3726B-ms98-a-0032 224.232125 229.466875 they loved building things they loved solving problems uh they liked
sw3726B-ms98-a-0033 229.466875 238.659875 you know being creative and there was another group of students there that were there to be engineers because they heard that engineers made a lot of money
sw3726B-ms98-a-0034 238.659875 247.480750 and we didn't mix very well you know there was a a total difference in attitude and we felt very
sw3726B-ms98-a-0035 247.480750 256.241125 [laughter] isolated or uh discriminated against in not being you know separate classes in terms of attitude
sw3726B-ms98-a-0036 256.241125 273.553250 [silence]
sw3726B-ms98-a-0037 273.553250 274.877500 um-hum
sw3726B-ms98-a-0038 274.877500 282.858875 [silence]
sw3726B-ms98-a-0039 282.858875 284.126375 yeah
sw3726B-ms98-a-0040 284.126375 288.890750 [silence]
sw3726B-ms98-a-0041 288.890750 299.170000 well that was a terribly precarious eco[nomy]- economy uh i've been kind of watching it over the years and observing that the the amount of bureaucracy over there
