sw3778B-ms98-a-0029 98.173750 108.870375 [noise] well you know sometimes in a funny kind of way life treats us like that that something we wouldn't normally do when we're placed in the circumstance we go ahead and do it and then
sw3778B-ms98-a-0030 108.870375 123.181125 uh things are kind of better afterwards and it it ultimately gives you an uplift i i i guess you have to look at it like that anyway or you might get depressed [laughter] and God forbid [laughter] but anyway
sw3778B-ms98-a-0031 123.181125 135.605125 but uh we had visitors from New York i'm really not from this area you must detect that i'm re[ally]- originally from the New York area and we had visitors uh both from New York and from California at Christmas time [noise]
sw3778B-ms98-a-0032 135.605125 147.251875 and um usually it is uh somewhat cold i mean cold enough to put on a winter coat or at least heavy sweaters and it was so mild here that uh they had to of course
sw3778B-ms98-a-0033 147.251875 160.434250 poke several funny jokes at us down here with this funny weather and you know whatever uh but uh i think they were very uh pleasantly happy because one person has um
sw3778B-ms98-a-0034 160.434250 163.885000 uh arthritis kind of stuff and um
sw3778B-ms98-a-0035 163.885000 174.129625 when it gets very cold they all crink up you know [laughter] and uh we didn't have any of that kind of problem this year so we were uh very grateful for that kind of thing
sw3778B-ms98-a-0036 174.129625 177.271500 [silence]
sw3778B-ms98-a-0037 177.271500 192.240000 that's right um-hum yeah uh-huh of course in California they have such a steadily more moderate climate that the temperatures even in the areas around San Francisco we used to live
sw3778B-ms98-a-0038 192.240000 200.693875 down in that Bay area the temperatures never got excessively cold if it got down around thirty two just about
sw3778B-ms98-a-0039 200.693875 209.942875 uh then the people would start panicking over the artichoke uh crops and uh avocados and of course down south the
sw3778B-ms98-a-0040 209.942875 223.417375 the orange groves and things like that you know the weather really does have a lot of effect on so many things and um when they grow those oranges down in the southlands they have these 
sw3778B-ms98-a-0041 223.417375 233.686625 braziers out in the field and they go around putting fires on if the temperatures gets down around thirty two or thirty and just levels off there so that
sw3778B-ms98-a-0042 233.686625 243.942750 they can uh regulate it by means of those like man made not too difficult um uh ways to to save the crops 
sw3778B-ms98-a-0043 243.942750 250.484125 but we all know what happens if those crops freeze uh we pay [laughter-for] [laughter-it] [laughter] yeah

sw3778B-ms98-a-0051 261.482000 269.310750 oh oh yes oh it's it's really well that happened here in Texas with the grapefruits that year a couple of years ago
sw3778B-ms98-a-0052 269.310750 279.633000 and the grapefruit crop was very uh very scarce uh so uh you know all of these major things the poor farmers but um
sw3778B-ms98-a-0053 279.633000 287.115750 anyway we'll just uh hope that uh we're not in for too many big freezes now but i know one big one will come [laughter]
sw3778B-ms98-a-0054 287.115750 298.786000 [laughter] and in it always does and uh i really don't mind those uh few uh snow flurries and those few days when there's a bit of snow
