sw3752B-ms98-a-0016 36.655625 37.951625 yeah
sw3752B-ms98-a-0017 37.951625 46.811750 i uh have a little bit of a background well my wife taught school for about six years
sw3752B-ms98-a-0018 46.811750 53.076750 and uh i'm almost convinced there's a lot of it has to do with environment uh
sw3752B-ms98-a-0019 53.076750 63.049875 she taught in a poor area poor area here in Utah and they recently did a big article in the local paper about the S A T scores
sw3752B-ms98-a-0020 63.049875 65.039375 in all the districts of the state
sw3752B-ms98-a-0021 65.039375 67.328250 and uh
sw3752B-ms98-a-0022 67.328250 81.080000 the district we're presently living in had like double the scores where she taught and it wasn't because she was a bad teacher or the teachers there were bad i think a lot of it has to do with the environment and the help the kids get from from home
sw3752B-ms98-a-0023 81.080000 102.746375 [silence]
sw3752B-ms98-a-0024 102.746375 104.071875 uh-huh
sw3752B-ms98-a-0025 104.071875 104.353250 [silence]

sw3752B-ms98-a-0027 105.606875 110.563625 [silence]
sw3752B-ms98-a-0028 110.563625 111.812875 uh-huh
sw3752B-ms98-a-0029 111.812875 116.306125 [silence]
sw3752B-ms98-a-0030 116.306125 116.643500 [noise]
sw3752B-ms98-a-0031 116.643500 117.777500 uh-huh
sw3752B-ms98-a-0032 117.777500 132.140000 [silence]

sw3752B-ms98-a-0034 133.574000 134.380000 [silence]
sw3752B-ms98-a-0035 134.380000 145.982375 yeah well you know you see these documentaries on uh on Japan for example and the uh rigors they put their students through i mean their high school students are going six days a week
sw3752B-ms98-a-0036 145.982375 146.951750 [silence]
sw3752B-ms98-a-0037 146.951750 157.078750 uh to get into college is uh no small feat there i mean just to be accepted i'm sure there are other countries that put a little more pressure on their on their children than than we do
sw3752B-ms98-a-0038 157.078750 162.442000 [silence]
sw3752B-ms98-a-0039 162.442000 173.445625 now we have that to a to a degree here that's only because we have a little bit of a of a problem that's i guess peculiar to Utah and we have a [noise] a high population of young young people
sw3752B-ms98-a-0040 173.445625 183.737750 young children one of the larger uh uh student teacher ratios [vocalized-noise] you know average class size is probably thirty five or something like that
sw3752B-ms98-a-0041 183.737750 195.870500 and that poses another problem where the you know just the individual attention that's needed sometimes uh is lacking because of the you know the shear numbers of it [noise] and what they've gone to is a year round program here where
sw3752B-ms98-a-0042 195.870500 201.960750 uh in essence they have what they call tracks and you know the kids go year round
sw3752B-ms98-a-0043 201.960750 212.874750 but you have uh you go like for uh eleven weeks and you're off for two or three then you go eleven weeks and so you have these these four periods rather than than the classic summer vacation
sw3752B-ms98-a-0044 212.874750 213.500000 [silence]
sw3752B-ms98-a-0045 213.500000 216.071125 these are just mostly the elementary grades however
sw3752B-ms98-a-0046 216.071125 221.469250 [silence]
sw3752B-ms98-a-0047 221.469250 225.255625 uh-huh

sw3752B-ms98-a-0054 259.071250 264.574375 oh that's that's interesting it's kind of like uh turning it over to the private sector to some degree
sw3752B-ms98-a-0055 264.574375 266.500000 and the the supply and demand works [vocalized-noise] yeah
sw3752B-ms98-a-0056 266.500000 267.026000 uh-huh 
sw3752B-ms98-a-0057 267.026000 268.460375 that's an interesting concept 
sw3752B-ms98-a-0058 268.460375 272.707125 [silence]
sw3752B-ms98-a-0059 272.707125 281.561750 yeah yeah i i [noise] the stories you read about the competency and the literacy of the high school graduates for example
