sw3780B-ms98-a-0035 154.336250 160.626750 well one of the funniest stories i remember is a boss that i had one time had an Alfa Romeo
sw3780B-ms98-a-0036 160.626750 166.848125 and he hit a bad railroad crossing somewhere and knocked the oil pan out on the car
sw3780B-ms98-a-0037 166.848125 173.833000 and he took it in to have the oil pan replaced and they replaced it and it was just leaking oil constantly
sw3780B-ms98-a-0038 173.833000 179.215375 and they he kept taking it back to get the oil pan fixed and uh they never could fix it
sw3780B-ms98-a-0039 179.215375 186.997250 and after about_1 a year and a half they finally realized that the pan that they'd replaced on that did not go with that serial number engine
sw3780B-ms98-a-0040 186.997250 189.753250 and so they ordered the right one
sw3780B-ms98-a-0041 189.753250 191.115125 [noise]
sw3780B-ms98-a-0042 191.115125 200.030375 and he came in all beaming and proud [noise] that this thing had finally been fixed and hadn't used a drop of oil in the last four or five days
sw3780B-ms98-a-0043 200.030375 201.732375 and uh
sw3780B-ms98-a-0044 201.732375 211.916375 well he would go out at lunchtime and he for months afterwards he'd come back and he'd look at his parking spot at his office and there was this puddle of oil there
sw3780B-ms98-a-0045 211.916375 221.610500 and he couldn't figure out what was going on he'd check his oil and you know it would still be up there and it hadn't u[sed]- hadn't added any oil but there was this oil slick in his parking spot
sw3780B-ms98-a-0046 221.610500 228.082875 well what he didn't know was the mechanical engineer that worked for him was kind of a mischievous type person
sw3780B-ms98-a-0047 228.082875 237.479500 and every lunchtime when he'd go out to lunch the mecha[nical]- the mechanical engineer would go into the shop and he'd get the used oil and come out and pour it in his parking [laughter-spot] 
sw3780B-ms98-a-0048 237.479500 240.204375 [silence]
sw3780B-ms98-a-0049 240.204375 247.495125 i don't think he ever did i think that mechanic went someplace else to work [laughter] before the oil slick ever cleared [laughter-up] 
sw3780B-ms98-a-0050 247.495125 257.105750 [silence]
