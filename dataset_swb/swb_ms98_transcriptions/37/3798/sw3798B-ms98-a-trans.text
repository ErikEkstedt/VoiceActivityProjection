sw3798B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 3.453125 [noise]
sw3798B-ms98-a-0002 3.453125 13.661500 [noise] well um uh that's something i've never thought a lot about um i've i work in a hospital and i've worked in the hospital for about fifteen years and i've taken care of a few AIDS patients
sw3798B-ms98-a-0003 13.661500 18.039625 um when they asked us did did we want to um
sw3798B-ms98-a-0004 18.039625 21.961500 [noise] keep it the same or uh spend more or spend less i think uh
sw3798B-ms98-a-0005 21.961500 27.630625 i think right now w[hat]- what they're spending is adequate uh my for my personal opinion
sw3798B-ms98-a-0006 27.630625 37.424000 um because_1 i think it's something that's gonna take them_1 a while to come up with a uh vaccine for i don't think it's gonna be that easy to come up with or i think they already would have by now you know
sw3798B-ms98-a-0007 37.424000 48.441875 and um so i don't know if if spending a lot more money would really make any difference right now i think they're doing the is as much research as they can possibly do you know and uh what about you
sw3798B-ms98-a-0008 48.441875 50.736000 [silence]
sw3798B-ms98-a-0009 50.736000 53.952875 i'm not either i'm definitely not aware of how much
sw3798B-ms98-a-0010 53.952875 57.439500 uh it's something i've never really kept up with at all
sw3798B-ms98-a-0011 57.439500 60.141625 um [noise] i don't kn[ow]-
sw3798B-ms98-a-0012 60.141625 69.474125 i'm not sure uh i know uh i've always thought more about the disease rather than the [vocalized-noise] research you know what i mean [laughter] and uh that sort of thing 
sw3798B-ms98-a-0013 69.474125 74.689250 um if if we were talking about the money um i'd just have to say
sw3798B-ms98-a-0014 74.689250 80.564375 what they're spending is probably enough simply because i don't know that much about it [laughter-you] [laughter-know]
sw3798B-ms98-a-0015 80.564375 83.523125 [silence]
sw3798B-ms98-a-0016 83.523125 86.826375 oh yeah i think so i think so
sw3798B-ms98-a-0017 86.826375 89.095625 yeah yeah
sw3798B-ms98-a-0018 89.095625 94.576375 [silence]
sw3798B-ms98-a-0019 94.576375 100.179125 yeah well that's true that's true because um it's a such an easily preventable disease
sw3798B-ms98-a-0020 100.179125 101.283000 um
sw3798B-ms98-a-0021 101.283000 105.166500 [silence]
sw3798B-ms98-a-0022 105.166500 107.370250 no it's definitely not
sw3798B-ms98-a-0023 107.370250 108.650750 [silence]
sw3798B-ms98-a-0024 108.650750 117.478875 that's true that's true um myself um [noise] um i'm just recently or about to get a divorce
sw3798B-ms98-a-0025 117.478875 125.037125 and uh course i'm not all ready to just run out there and start dating everybody i can or anything but it's sort of scary
sw3798B-ms98-a-0026 125.037125 135.231750 to find yourself single again you know and um because you never know what's gonna happen [laughter] you don't know who you're gonna come across you know course it's it's not that i'm wanting to
sw3798B-ms98-a-0027 135.231750 143.106125 i'm not gonna wanting to go and have sex with [laughter-everybody] i see but it's something you got to think about these days a single person
sw3798B-ms98-a-0028 143.106125 151.311375 you know and um i mean it certainly changed my attitude about that in a hurry and um
sw3798B-ms98-a-0029 151.311375 153.722875 certainly yeah
sw3798B-ms98-a-0030 153.722875 160.960125 but um uh i know that uh in some of these larger cities they're passing out free syringes
sw3798B-ms98-a-0031 160.960125 169.891000 and all of that sort of thing to prevent you know so that uh the drug addicts won't be getting dirty needles and everything [noise] and uh i don't know i don't think that's a bad idea
sw3798B-ms98-a-0032 169.891000 176.345000 i know it uh sort of doesn't address the problem of drug addiction [laughter] it just sort of keeps that going
sw3798B-ms98-a-0033 176.345000 182.030125 [noise] but um i don't know at least drug addiction can be treated whereas AIDS so far cannot be
sw3798B-ms98-a-0034 182.030125 189.914000 you know so i don't know that i think that's i'm not t[oo]- too much against the the passing out of the free syringes myself i don't know what do you think about that
sw3798B-ms98-a-0035 189.914000 192.481500 [silence]
sw3798B-ms98-a-0036 192.481500 199.259250 it's it really is it really is they gave us a hard topic [laughter]
sw3798B-ms98-a-0037 199.259250 207.594125 [silence]
sw3798B-ms98-a-0038 207.594125 209.431000 um-hum
sw3798B-ms98-a-0039 209.431000 212.194375 that's true that's true
sw3798B-ms98-a-0040 212.194375 216.197500 [silence]
sw3798B-ms98-a-0041 216.197500 223.997000 yeah you know i guess if you consider the two problems drug addiction an AIDS AIDS would have to have come first i guess as far as
sw3798B-ms98-a-0042 223.997000 230.085375 something to uh to do about it so so i don't know um course there's so many things in the world where
sw3798B-ms98-a-0043 230.085375 234.117375 if you solve one problem you may be creating another [laughter] you know
sw3798B-ms98-a-0044 234.117375 242.308625 and uh so i guess you just have to take the two problems and see which is worse and which is the most important to solve at the time and i don't know but um
sw3798B-ms98-a-0045 242.308625 246.495875 but i've never looked into how much money they're spending i have i have no idea
sw3798B-ms98-a-0046 246.495875 249.118500 and i know a lot of our tax money goes to that
sw3798B-ms98-a-0047 249.118500 252.736875 but uh i really have never looked into it i have no idea um
sw3798B-ms98-a-0048 252.736875 253.770625 [silence]
sw3798B-ms98-a-0049 253.770625 255.277625 yeah

sw3798B-ms98-a-0056 266.209625 269.376500 [laughter] yeah i think it is i think it is
sw3798B-ms98-a-0057 269.376500 278.426500 yeah it does every it seems to take more than uh for any little thing they do it seems to take a lot more money that you would think it would you know but uh
sw3798B-ms98-a-0058 278.426500 280.460625 [silence]
sw3798B-ms98-a-0059 280.460625 286.546000 uh that's one thing i've never really feared um [noise] uh i a lot of the my family
sw3798B-ms98-a-0060 286.546000 298.754000 you know they fear me working like that and under some some of those conditions but um uh i don't fear it at all um i work in in the operating room a lot [noise] and um and of course when we
