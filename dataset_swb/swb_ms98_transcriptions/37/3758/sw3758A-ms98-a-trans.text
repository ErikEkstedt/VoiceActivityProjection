sw3758A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 14.502875 the reason i was thinking about trials by jury and um [noise] i- i guess i thought more highly of it until the uh recent [noise] William Kennedy Smith [noise] case where they uh were telling about how they used um
sw3758A-ms98-a-0002 14.502875 21.818750 what they consider scientific methods to choose the right jurors to get the right results you know for their chance what do you think about that

sw3758A-ms98-a-0027 161.312625 172.173875 [laughter] yes well i know um [noise] fairly recently when that um one of the court sessions for John Wylie Price [noise] i remember that um
sw3758A-ms98-a-0028 172.173875 179.127250 [noise] and though i had agreed with some of the things he did i- i disagreed with that particular case because he um
sw3758A-ms98-a-0029 179.127250 188.601375 [noise] they made they got a lot of mileage out that they that that was not a jury of his peers that um they said you know that he was found guilty and then
sw3758A-ms98-a-0030 188.601375 195.881750 h[e]- uh then they made note that none of the [noise] the jurors were uh black or Afri[can]- African American and
sw3758A-ms98-a-0031 195.881750 204.650875 and it seemed to me that if he wanted [laughter] if they wanted that i mean they chose them deliberately i mean because of all of the [noise] publicity that it got from that
sw3758A-ms98-a-0032 204.650875 216.102875 and i really thought well [noise] you know one of their points that they made on purpose was they chose people who they felt were not their own peers in order to make the case against him weaker
sw3758A-ms98-a-0033 216.102875 226.469125 and it just seemed like it wasn't very fair that that you know that was [noise] something that could have been said at the very beginning and not cost the tax payers the money for that court
