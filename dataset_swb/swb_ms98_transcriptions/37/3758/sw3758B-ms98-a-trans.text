sw3758B-ms98-a-0003 3.058000 8.767375 [silence]
sw3758B-ms98-a-0004 8.767375 10.146125 um-hum
sw3758B-ms98-a-0005 10.146125 19.066375 [silence]
sw3758B-ms98-a-0006 19.066375 20.689000 uh-huh uh-huh
sw3758B-ms98-a-0007 20.689000 22.100125 [silence]
sw3758B-ms98-a-0008 22.100125 35.076375 well [noise] um [noise] you know it's it's like anything else i mean [noise] i guess i probably should mention i am an attorney and i and i although i don't do trial work now i have done so in the past and um [noise]
sw3758B-ms98-a-0009 35.076375 40.748375 i have to say that i've never been in the position to uh
sw3758B-ms98-a-0010 40.748375 52.286625 uh make use of uh the types of techniques but for years there have been [noise] uh books written that everybody has access to about techniques in j[ury]- in jury selection
sw3758B-ms98-a-0011 52.286625 59.974375 and um you know uh i mean it kind of the way it kind of really actually works out in real life i don't think it's fair
sw3758B-ms98-a-0012 59.974375 66.838250 um necessarily for one side [noise] because they have a lot of money
sw3758B-ms98-a-0013 66.838250 69.851250 [noise] to be able to uh
sw3758B-ms98-a-0014 69.851250 81.187375 y[ou]- you know it it kind of it strikes me as as unfair that if you have got enough money you can pick the jury you want and really the system doesn't [noise] exactly allow that anyway
sw3758B-ms98-a-0015 81.187375 91.735750 the b[est]- the best you get on jury selection is is if you've got to pick a jury of twelve people you get a certain number of what they call preemptory strikes and a certain number of of
sw3758B-ms98-a-0016 91.735750 100.533625 um [noise] each side gets those and and then there are are strikes you know an unlimited number of strikes for what they call for cause
sw3758B-ms98-a-0017 100.533625 102.260250 [noise] and uh
sw3758B-ms98-a-0018 102.260250 105.918750 y[ou]- you know [noise] obviously
sw3758B-ms98-a-0019 105.918750 111.009750 people whose whose livelihood depends on um
sw3758B-ms98-a-0020 111.009750 121.176250 jury jury trials are going to use whatever they can use to try uh to improve their chances and and you know it's g[et]- it's
sw3758B-ms98-a-0021 121.176250 132.050500 the unfair part of it is that not everybody has access to the high powered technique but then then the the saving grace is that it can only get you so far
sw3758B-ms98-a-0022 132.050500 144.107250 i mean you know i[t]- it you may find that the first three people on the panel are ideal jurors for you but the other side is probably going to even if i was sitting there with no
sw3758B-ms98-a-0023 144.107250 156.387375 um [noise] high-powered computer input and whatnot if i could just ask them_1 questions i could tell that they're gonna be good jurors for you and bad jurors for me i'm gonna strike them_1 so you're not going to get them_1
sw3758B-ms98-a-0024 156.387375 158.569750 i mean you can't really get what you want
sw3758B-ms98-a-0025 158.569750 162.451500 you can just improve your chances of guessing who you think you want
sw3758B-ms98-a-0026 162.451500 169.600500 [silence]
sw3758B-ms98-a-0027 169.600500 171.066500 uh-huh
sw3758B-ms98-a-0028 171.066500 202.913125 [silence]
sw3758B-ms98-a-0029 202.913125 204.827375 um-hum um-hum
sw3758B-ms98-a-0030 204.827375 225.529625 [silence]
sw3758B-ms98-a-0031 225.529625 232.201375 yeah well you know it's it's kind of been uh uh you see a lot in the death penalty cases
sw3758B-ms98-a-0032 232.201375 241.031250 that there a lot of the attorneys there are attorneys who strongly believe that the death penalty is not right
sw3758B-ms98-a-0033 241.031250 251.584375 and they um have pretty much dedicated themselves to doing everything they can to prevent uh [noise] people sentenced to the death penalty from being executed
sw3758B-ms98-a-0034 251.584375 263.000125 and they will go through endless appeals and one of the things that has been used and and it's been used most often um in in in the death penalty cases is the fact that 
sw3758B-ms98-a-0035 263.000125 271.778875 you know that the the majority of people who are convicted if they're black they may not have any blacks or they might have one black on their jury panel
sw3758B-ms98-a-0036 271.778875 278.940125 and they have tried to statistically tie this to the likelihood of him getting the death penalty
sw3758B-ms98-a-0037 278.940125 287.538375 but they've never really been successful in it and the Supreme Court has has up to this point continued to reject those types of arguments
sw3758B-ms98-a-0038 287.538375 295.127750 saying that that somebody didn't get a fair trial because there wasn't a certain [noise] quota of blacks on the jury panel
sw3758B-ms98-a-0039 295.127750 299.170000 and i really do think that those arguments will continue to fail because
