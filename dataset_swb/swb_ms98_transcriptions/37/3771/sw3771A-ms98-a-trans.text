sw3771A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.060000 [noise]
sw3771A-ms98-a-0002 0.060000 6.756750 because uh discuss crime in America and what we might be ab[le]- uh do to uh help stop it
sw3771A-ms98-a-0003 6.756750 14.777875 [silence]
sw3771A-ms98-a-0004 14.777875 19.470875 oh yeah well actually i- i- i live in Houston i'm in Miami on business
sw3771A-ms98-a-0005 19.470875 24.989750 uh but i've i've been down here quite a bit for the past oh six months on and off
sw3771A-ms98-a-0006 24.989750 33.993125 and yes there is plenty of crime in Miami uh [noise] but you know um i don't know that it's any worse than Houston
sw3771A-ms98-a-0007 33.993125 39.722625 [silence]
sw3771A-ms98-a-0008 39.722625 42.994875 and i know there's plenty of crime in Dallas too
sw3771A-ms98-a-0009 42.994875 44.301750 [silence]
sw3771A-ms98-a-0010 44.301750 45.952000 yeah
sw3771A-ms98-a-0011 45.952000 69.961625 [silence]
sw3771A-ms98-a-0012 69.961625 82.274750 yeah i have uh i was talking with some w[ith]- with a friend of mine not too damned long ago and i'll tell you it it's you know i don't expect this would ever happen in the United States but i'm almost of the opinion
sw3771A-ms98-a-0013 82.274750 95.998625 that the only way that a change is going to come about is if uh we really put some teeth into the law and and make it such that uh the punishment fits the crime and uh
sw3771A-ms98-a-0014 95.998625 109.452375 have a a swift and and sure justice that uh you know do away with some of these automatic uh appeals when uh i think that guilt is proven
sw3771A-ms98-a-0015 109.452375 133.985625 [silence]
sw3771A-ms98-a-0016 133.985625 144.799875 well in in Houston it's absurd they are letting uh uh people that have been convicted three times for armed robbery
sw3771A-ms98-a-0017 144.799875 149.354750 for example and this was they had a big article in the Houston newspaper about it
sw3771A-ms98-a-0018 149.354750 158.252250 because of the overcrowding they're being released from Huntsville they're given two hundred dollars and put on a bus for Houston with instructions to turn themselves in to a parole officer
sw3771A-ms98-a-0019 158.252250 166.353625 less than twenty percent or tw[enty]- ten percent it was a ridiculously low low number actually do ever report to a par[ole]- parole officer
sw3771A-ms98-a-0020 166.353625 176.235250 and the vast majority of them_1 are then caught again go through the courts back to jail well it's ludicrous and absurd
sw3771A-ms98-a-0021 176.235250 187.553000 and [vocalized-noise] i- i just don't think that you know we as a society can afford to continue to have these people that are repeat offenders being paroled after serving 
sw3771A-ms98-a-0022 187.553000 192.799375 a a fraction sometimes you know a quarter of their sentence
sw3771A-ms98-a-0023 192.799375 196.704250 but uh i- i don't know it's uh i don't own a gun
sw3771A-ms98-a-0024 196.704250 201.762125 and uh [noise] i you know i believe and i adhere to the thought that
sw3771A-ms98-a-0025 201.762125 207.277500 you know if you so often i mean it's it's having a gun leads to tragedy
sw3771A-ms98-a-0026 207.277500 211.779000 and at the same and at the same time
sw3771A-ms98-a-0027 211.779000 218.243375 i think i have thought before what would i do if i were accosted
sw3771A-ms98-a-0028 218.243375 219.993250 you know
sw3771A-ms98-a-0029 219.993250 230.999750 a a fellow i work with uh in Houston he told me uh just this past week his wife was walking out of a mall ten o'clock in the morning in Houston and was robbed
sw3771A-ms98-a-0030 230.999750 233.988500 broad open daylight in the parking lot
sw3771A-ms98-a-0031 233.988500 235.988000 [silence]
sw3771A-ms98-a-0032 235.988000 241.943375 so anyway it it is it's a scary situation and i really don't know what this what the answer
sw3771A-ms98-a-0033 241.943375 268.961750 [silence]
sw3771A-ms98-a-0034 268.961750 277.509625 yeah i've i'm i'm a firm believer though that uh [noise] our justice system has has no teeth any longer that the idea of getting a sentence
sw3771A-ms98-a-0035 277.509625 291.487000 uh a[nd]- and knowing that the parole uh will come uh uh just in a short matter of time not only that we have people in jail now that i mean if had a program on Sixty Minutes i mean that they have telephones [vocalized-noise] 
sw3771A-ms98-a-0036 291.487000 294.725375 in their jail cells it's absurd
sw3771A-ms98-a-0037 294.725375 297.987375 yeah so i mean i don't know
sw3771A-ms98-a-0038 297.987375 299.618000 yeah i don't know it's yeah
