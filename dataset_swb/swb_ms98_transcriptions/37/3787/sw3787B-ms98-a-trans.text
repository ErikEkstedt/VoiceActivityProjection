sw3787B-ms98-a-0014 100.922375 108.380000 but the thing that he is wanting to try this year is um using some organic treatments and
sw3787B-ms98-a-0015 108.380000 111.857750 we're not real naturalists or anything but um
sw3787B-ms98-a-0016 111.857750 124.424625 what we have heard is that the [noise] amount of fertilizer that we put on our lawns is about the same amount that a farmer would [laughter-put] [laughter-on] [laughter-a] [laughter-whole] entire crop
sw3787B-ms98-a-0017 124.424625 129.260625 and uh [noise] i have a cold so [laughter-i'm] [laughter-having] [laughter-a] [laughter-hard] [laughter-time]

sw3787B-ms98-a-0020 145.229750 158.696500 the only problem was they never told us when they were coming and then you find a note on your door that says water within [laughter-two] [laughter-to] [laughter-three] [laughter-days] and it was never uh right right but uh
sw3787B-ms98-a-0021 158.696500 177.848000 [silence]

sw3787B-ms98-a-0027 193.068000 200.862000 yeah we tried using Chem Lawn but um our problem is our front yard is completely different from the backyard
sw3787B-ms98-a-0028 200.862000 210.555750 and um i think they just use the same stuff on [laughter-everything] because_1 we've got a mixture our front yard is um all Bermuda what's not weeds [laughter]
sw3787B-ms98-a-0029 210.555750 220.926625 [noise] and the backyard is a mixture of Saint Augustine Bermuda and some type of uh winter grass that stays green all all winter
sw3787B-ms98-a-0030 220.926625 225.239125 yeah something like that it's real clumpy and
sw3787B-ms98-a-0031 225.239125 229.909250 [silence]

sw3787B-ms98-a-0039 279.232250 292.487250 yeah yeah i think that's our problem is that we we just need to get it fertilized really good so that we can get the gra[ss]- grass growing rather [laughter-than] the weeds
sw3787B-ms98-a-0040 292.487250 298.018000 [noise] um in the front yard not so much we have a l[ot]-
