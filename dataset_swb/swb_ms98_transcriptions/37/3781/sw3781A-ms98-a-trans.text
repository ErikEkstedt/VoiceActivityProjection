sw3781A-ms98-a-0023 65.295875 73.135875 [noise] basically um i just keep them i use them so that i build up a credit rating you know but otherwise um
sw3781A-ms98-a-0024 73.135875 87.498750 i generally and my husband it turns out i've just been married seven months but he has the same habit and we just keep a few you know few of the major ones and then use them once in a while for something but we always pay it off right that month
sw3781A-ms98-a-0025 87.498750 95.810500 [noise] so that we don't pay any service charge so that way we keep out of debt and we keep on top of what we're spending

sw3781A-ms98-a-0043 172.480875 183.540000 um i think Sears originally put it out but it's um it's pretty well taken all over the US now i mean uh i've haven't found many places that don't take Discover
