sw3781B-ms98-a-0036 141.470000 150.976250 and uh i saw on TV they had a program on uh credit cards and they're supposed to i don't know if it was Tennessee or Arkansas or some some other state had a
sw3781B-ms98-a-0037 150.976250 160.773125 Visa card that was the lowest one in the country and i didn't write it down at the time and then i went and looked and to see what my Visa was and i think it's eighteen percent or something so
sw3781B-ms98-a-0038 160.773125 164.685125 think i want to find something that has a lower rate

sw3781B-ms98-a-0054 217.260625 222.966375 i worked w[ith]- at Sears for over ten years and uh it was only a Sears card that they would take
sw3781B-ms98-a-0055 222.966375 230.494875 until i guess they decided to join the club and come up with their own credit card another credit card that was accepted so
sw3781B-ms98-a-0056 230.494875 236.741000 you know now they'll take the Discover but i still don't know if Sears will take Visa or MasterCard
sw3781B-ms98-a-0057 236.741000 242.490750 but uh i never did apply for a Discover card i just figure with the Visa and
