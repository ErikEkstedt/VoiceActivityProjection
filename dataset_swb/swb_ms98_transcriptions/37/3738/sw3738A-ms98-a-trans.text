sw3738A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 3.564625 [noise] [laughter] okay you ready to discuss the the topic 
sw3738A-ms98-a-0002 3.564625 15.445250 okay the topic is social changes and discuss social changes [vocalized-noise] in America and how they relate or how they differ today than they were ten fifteen or thirty years ago
sw3738A-ms98-a-0003 15.445250 20.010875 are you ready for that [noise] okay [noise] pardon me
sw3738A-ms98-a-0004 20.010875 28.835500 [laughter-okay] well uh there's uh it's kind of an in[teresting]- interesting topic and one that i think is quite fascinating because
sw3738A-ms98-a-0005 28.835500 40.722625 uh couple of years ago i guess uh not very not m[any]- not very long ago seemed like the whole world not just the United States but the whole world was kind of in a standstill where everyone was
sw3738A-ms98-a-0006 40.722625 44.430375 basically in a
sw3738A-ms98-a-0007 44.430375 51.280625 you know a very comfortable position so to say even though the the cold war was was in full swing
sw3738A-ms98-a-0008 51.280625 56.706625 you know you had the the Russians against the Americans the Communists against the Free World
sw3738A-ms98-a-0009 56.706625 67.260250 and in the last couple of years things have [tranged/changed] dramatically [noise] not only on the political front but also on the economic front where
sw3738A-ms98-a-0010 67.260250 80.759125 uh couple of years ago we had uh America uh was a one of the leading powers and one of the strongest nations in the world as far as economics were concerned and now we're
sw3738A-ms98-a-0011 80.759125 89.986750 having a very tough time in a recessionary period we're also have a very humongous trade deficit and uh
sw3738A-ms98-a-0012 89.986750 103.468375 and that's kind of frightening also you know a couple of years ago ten fif[teen]- fifteen ten fifteen years ago an individual going into a career could expect to have that career basically throughout their whole life
sw3738A-ms98-a-0013 103.468375 116.733625 and thirty years ago that was that was basically it whereas now we're expected to have a career change every you know every couple years and possibly fi[ve]- four to five career changes throughout our lifetime
sw3738A-ms98-a-0014 116.733625 118.875500 and so i think uh
sw3738A-ms98-a-0015 118.875500 125.031125 you know things there's been an awful lot of social change lately and a lo[t]- and uh

sw3738A-ms98-a-0032 180.742250 189.678250 that someth[ing]- yeah because a lot of people seem to stagnate once they get into position they they're very comfortable they lose the ability to learn
sw3738A-ms98-a-0033 189.678250 199.216375 and the in a sense become unteachable they think they know all there is to know in their area set path and you know come in and put my time in from nine to five and
