sw3723A-ms98-a-0032 156.987875 167.936875 and i understand that walking is suppose to be like the best exercise better than running things like that because_1 it it works everything and it gets your breathing up and it it doesn't
sw3723A-ms98-a-0033 167.936875 174.617250 yeah it doesn't you know hurt you like i understand running hurts your shins or knees or something like that
