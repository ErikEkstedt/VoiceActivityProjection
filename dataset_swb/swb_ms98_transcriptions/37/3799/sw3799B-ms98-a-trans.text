sw3799B-ms98-a-0036 126.196500 130.113750 yeah you really you have to be a little more selective
sw3799B-ms98-a-0037 130.113750 136.444875 you might even want to consider cold calling a couple of places for or checking the newspaper
sw3799B-ms98-a-0038 136.444875 138.303875 uh
sw3799B-ms98-a-0039 138.303875 146.511750 there might even be cottage industries now listed in the newspaper because_1 that's what it ends up being a cottage industry

sw3799B-ms98-a-0045 167.187000 171.381750 i was thinking that they had recently come out with one that is
sw3799B-ms98-a-0046 171.381750 173.675375 [silence]
sw3799B-ms98-a-0047 173.675375 175.496000 ah uh-huh

sw3799B-ms98-a-0055 189.234625 190.291125 [silence]
sw3799B-ms98-a-0056 190.291125 193.851250 well they're real inexpensive to get the clones now
sw3799B-ms98-a-0057 193.851250 197.728750 and i don't know if you watch your sale ads very often
sw3799B-ms98-a-0058 197.728750 201.377250 but if you do particularly Best Buy
sw3799B-ms98-a-0059 201.377250 202.395625 [silence]
sw3799B-ms98-a-0060 202.395625 211.423625 and Circuit City i saw a three eighty six hundred and twenty megabyte hard drive with dual floppies and
sw3799B-ms98-a-0061 211.423625 214.405500 oh gosh the VGA color monitor
sw3799B-ms98-a-0062 214.405500 222.492125 and it also included quite a few other things i mean pieces of software and a mouse for about two thousand or less
sw3799B-ms98-a-0063 222.492125 226.917125 and that's a really nice package for about that much money
sw3799B-ms98-a-0064 226.917125 236.849000 [silence]
sw3799B-ms98-a-0065 236.849000 238.373625 uh-huh
sw3799B-ms98-a-0066 238.373625 241.560250 [silence]
sw3799B-ms98-a-0067 241.560250 243.427250 the three and a half floppy
sw3799B-ms98-a-0068 243.427250 245.913375 those are nicer
sw3799B-ms98-a-0069 245.913375 249.211125 those i prefer that over the larger floppy
sw3799B-ms98-a-0070 249.211125 250.435875 [silence]
sw3799B-ms98-a-0071 250.435875 254.482375 they take up it you can get more information on the disk
sw3799B-ms98-a-0072 254.482375 255.739875 no
sw3799B-ms98-a-0073 255.739875 259.400000 i don't know what it is i guess because it's harder
sw3799B-ms98-a-0074 259.400000 264.715625 that you can get more information on it than you can on the larger ones
sw3799B-ms98-a-0075 264.715625 270.739250 and they're a lot easier to transport because it's harder to to damage them
sw3799B-ms98-a-0076 270.739250 272.680500 [silence]
sw3799B-ms98-a-0077 272.680500 275.321750 being in the harder plastic case
sw3799B-ms98-a-0078 275.321750 279.153125 so that's just a something that i've come across
sw3799B-ms98-a-0079 279.153125 283.049000 [silence]
sw3799B-ms98-a-0080 283.049000 290.201125 well that's m[ostly]- um now that's what we have we don't have a real IBM i don't know of too many people who afford IBM
sw3799B-ms98-a-0081 290.201125 291.405750 but uh
sw3799B-ms98-a-0082 291.405750 296.345000 we've had not a minute of trouble out of ours not a minute
sw3799B-ms98-a-0083 296.345000 298.946000 and i would i would recommend it to other people
