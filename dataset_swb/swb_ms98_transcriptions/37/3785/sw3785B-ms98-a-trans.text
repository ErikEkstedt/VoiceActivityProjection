sw3785B-ms98-a-0004 4.487125 9.784125 not that really much exposure in the in the recent past either how about yourself

sw3785B-ms98-a-0006 15.751750 17.284875 um-hum
sw3785B-ms98-a-0007 17.284875 19.495375 and do you have any children

sw3785B-ms98-a-0014 37.771125 48.223375 i think it's probably a combination you know i think probably parents expect a lot more out of the school system than it's realistic that that the school system can provide
sw3785B-ms98-a-0015 48.223375 58.698625 and in conjunction a lot of um school districts' funds have been cut because of at least in California that's the case it's probably the case elsewhere too
sw3785B-ms98-a-0016 58.698625 71.196625 [silence]
sw3785B-ms98-a-0017 71.196625 81.462750 i don't even know if it's just because um people are working you know both parents are working outside the home as much as it it's a matter of
sw3785B-ms98-a-0018 81.462750 82.471000 [silence]
sw3785B-ms98-a-0019 82.471000 88.491250 well it's kind of a philos[ophical]- philosophical expectation about who's responsible for discipline you know it's
sw3785B-ms98-a-0020 88.491250 89.497250 [silence]
sw3785B-ms98-a-0021 89.497250 90.506875 it
sw3785B-ms98-a-0022 90.506875 98.247375 you know y[ou]- you could be working full time and um still be able to work with your child and provide some guidance at home and
sw3785B-ms98-a-0023 98.247375 108.159375 in terms of homework as well as the the you know discipline for what's important in terms of values and i think that's probably something that not as many kids get i mean just i guess
sw3785B-ms98-a-0024 108.159375 115.992250 i say that because you see it reflected in the society at large there are a lot of kids out there who seem more troubled today than they used to be

sw3785B-ms98-a-0030 136.733625 139.979750 maybe TV's a bigger um
sw3785B-ms98-a-0031 139.979750 143.991000 competitor for their time [laughter]
sw3785B-ms98-a-0032 143.991000 146.474750 and when we were kids
sw3785B-ms98-a-0033 146.474750 157.489125 [silence]

sw3785B-ms98-a-0038 172.491875 177.739375 that's a good point just learning the discipline to to to study
sw3785B-ms98-a-0039 177.739375 186.172750 [silence]
sw3785B-ms98-a-0040 186.172750 188.488250 um-hum um-hum
sw3785B-ms98-a-0041 188.488250 201.994875 well probably having gone through that experience you'll be likely to want to s[peak]- speak with her uh teachers and really try to communicate with them to find out what it is that you can do to help her at home
sw3785B-ms98-a-0042 201.994875 203.478375 [silence]
sw3785B-ms98-a-0043 203.478375 208.482125 our daughter's two so i'm in sort of in the same boat that you are [laughter]
sw3785B-ms98-a-0044 208.482125 210.485750 [silence]
sw3785B-ms98-a-0045 210.485750 220.691875 [noise] well you know we're coming up on the time she's probably going to be ready for she's in a day care situation now because my husband and i both work full time but um
sw3785B-ms98-a-0046 220.691875 229.271875 i think she'll probably be ready for preschool around three or three and a half and after that time we really do need to think about it because in San Francisco
sw3785B-ms98-a-0047 229.271875 241.996125 in our neighborhood there's actually a good public schools at the elementary grade there's not a really decent middle school or high school i'm not sure we'll be in the same area when she's that old but um [noise]
sw3785B-ms98-a-0048 241.996125 245.492250 i have to really do the research to find out
sw3785B-ms98-a-0049 245.492250 251.494125 whether or not the public schools stand up to the private schools and what the costs are and all that
sw3785B-ms98-a-0050 251.494125 256.465500 it's really the the expense is a real issue [laughter] when you think about
sw3785B-ms98-a-0051 256.465500 266.250375 [silence]
sw3785B-ms98-a-0052 266.250375 268.802500 um-hum um-hum

sw3785B-ms98-a-0054 272.489625 276.994625 well i don't know how it is in your community i know that um
sw3785B-ms98-a-0055 276.994625 285.707000 in some communities of San Francisco the public schools well actually it's not so much in the city actually it's outside more in the ea[st]- Oakland or east bay 
sw3785B-ms98-a-0056 285.707000 299.074000 um the public schools are so poor that the private schools have just really grown as a response to the fact that the parents don't feel that they're getting getting what they want in the public schools so they're almost like pub[lic]-
