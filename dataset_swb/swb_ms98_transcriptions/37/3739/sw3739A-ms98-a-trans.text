sw3739A-ms98-a-0016 70.174625 77.858125 [noise] another thing i think the uh that the President could do right now on a short term basis to get things speeded up is
sw3739A-ms98-a-0017 77.858125 89.090125 help out the working people right now the middle income people uh give them_1 some tax credits i think they've done that i seems like i remember that happening once in my past i'm in my forties and i
sw3739A-ms98-a-0018 89.090125 95.087125 basically remember getting some sort of [trax/tax] tax credit years ago and i think it helped i think we bought a car
sw3739A-ms98-a-0019 95.087125 99.014000 uh at that time because we got some sort of a rebate
sw3739A-ms98-a-0020 99.014000 135.491750 [silence]
sw3739A-ms98-a-0021 135.491750 146.625125 well i've always believed in paying my fair share of of of taxes oh and whatever my government says is my fair share is what i think i should pay
sw3739A-ms98-a-0022 146.625125 156.286125 uh i don't necessarily agree with people who go out of their way to find loopholes and not paying their fair share [vocalized-noise]
sw3739A-ms98-a-0023 156.286125 168.118625 [silence]

sw3739A-ms98-a-0025 174.276375 184.393625 and sometimes i go with them and sometimes i don't uh since i no longer work uh usually it's not very complicated anymore but uh
sw3739A-ms98-a-0026 184.393625 193.053000 i no longer work uh [noise] oh it's been almost three years ago i had some uh strange heart problems occur
sw3739A-ms98-a-0027 193.053000 199.213875 and uh so i'm more or less hang around the house and uh that sort of thing

sw3739A-ms98-a-0033 224.777375 236.368375 so it took some while to adjust to it and it and it took some adjusting financially and things like that i can no longer afford [noise] things that maybe i used to take for granted
sw3739A-ms98-a-0034 236.368375 241.021875 and i certainly can't invest money like i used to [laughter]
