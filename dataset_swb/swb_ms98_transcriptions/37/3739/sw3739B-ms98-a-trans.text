sw3739B-ms98-a-0005 20.448375 24.213375 what we need to do and that's sort of a function of the economy
sw3739B-ms98-a-0006 24.213375 36.748375 and our relationship with uh other countries and so forth and right now we're in this big change since Russia has undergone such a uh big uh renegotiation within themselves
sw3739B-ms98-a-0007 36.748375 40.582750 and i'm sure that we haven't quite decided where we stand in that yet

sw3739B-ms98-a-0011 58.823250 70.324125 show them what it what it takes to have a a capitalistic society and one in which each of them has a a say and uh you know can express their thoughts safely

sw3739B-ms98-a-0019 97.871750 105.085875 oh i don't recall ever getting a rebate but it does seem as though if if we are able to
sw3739B-ms98-a-0020 105.085875 114.553500 reduce the our expenditures for defense course we've got to get get this big debt that the country has under control
sw3739B-ms98-a-0021 114.553500 121.665375 and if as we get that under control then i'd like to see the taxes that we pay reduced
sw3739B-ms98-a-0022 121.665375 132.510125 a certain amount you know so that we're all comfortable but i do believe that the country's gonna have to get itself straightened out {debtwise} before uh they could do too much that way
sw3739B-ms98-a-0023 132.510125 136.323625 but i hate to see them_1 raise the taxes if it's unnecessary

sw3739B-ms98-a-0029 154.912750 169.688125 yes it it it seems as though a lot of the things that we see in the paper and in letters that you receive are showing you loopholes or how not to pay your share and that really is sort of against what the whole ball game's about isn't it
sw3739B-ms98-a-0030 169.688125 173.788250 [silence]
