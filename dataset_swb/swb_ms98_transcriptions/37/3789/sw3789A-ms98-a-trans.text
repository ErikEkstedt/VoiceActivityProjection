sw3789A-ms98-a-0066 210.481750 214.627125 yeah it's it's real handy once you're you know if you like my roommate broke his arm
sw3789A-ms98-a-0067 214.627125 227.986000 and he went to the hospital he went in to the emergency room and they took care of his arm and he every time he went to one he only had to pay five dollars and he probably went through you know quite a bit of care uh the medicine was expensive the cast was expensive the stitches were expensive and all that
sw3789A-ms98-a-0068 227.986000 233.963250 and uh you know it it was real cheap i mean once you have a condition and you go to the hospital it probably works out real uh but for just like
sw3789A-ms98-a-0069 233.963250 242.187375 i don't know i'm i'm only twenty four years old you know i don't really get sick a lot you know i in fact uh over the last two years i've only gone to see the doctor once and that was for a physical
sw3789A-ms98-a-0070 242.187375 244.073250 so you know for me
sw3789A-ms98-a-0071 244.073250 246.937875 you know i don't i don't see the doctor a whole hell of a lot you know
sw3789A-ms98-a-0072 246.937875 252.593250 so but then again you know the year before that i when i had the regular plan you know you have a hundred dollar deductible
sw3789A-ms98-a-0073 252.593250 257.275625 well i went to the doctor once and it cost me ninety [laughter-bucks] [laughter-so] it was like oh well
sw3789A-ms98-a-0074 257.275625 259.911750 i guess i could've done pretty good with the five dollar visit
sw3789A-ms98-a-0075 259.911750 261.078000 so
sw3789A-ms98-a-0076 261.078000 267.283875 [silence]
sw3789A-ms98-a-0077 267.283875 269.448375 wow that's a lot

sw3789A-ms98-a-0081 276.646375 282.994000 hum yeah K[aiser's]- expensive i mean i think it's uh this year it's like almost four thousand eight hundred dollars
sw3789A-ms98-a-0082 282.994000 286.054500 [silence]
sw3789A-ms98-a-0083 286.054500 288.865000 yeah that w[orks]- that works out pretty handy
