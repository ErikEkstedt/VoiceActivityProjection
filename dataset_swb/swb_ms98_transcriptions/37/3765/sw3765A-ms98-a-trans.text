sw3765A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.086625 [noise]
sw3765A-ms98-a-0002 1.086625 2.550500 it's Lee
sw3765A-ms98-a-0003 2.550500 4.895875 uh and you're Bob
sw3765A-ms98-a-0004 4.895875 6.040375 uh
sw3765A-ms98-a-0005 6.040375 8.679125 i've been uh
sw3765A-ms98-a-0006 8.679125 12.892750 thinking about the topic and i think it's uh
sw3765A-ms98-a-0007 12.892750 17.253000 going to be interesting to see what happens as the criminal justice system
sw3765A-ms98-a-0008 17.253000 20.223625 responds to the tremendous
sw3765A-ms98-a-0009 20.223625 22.506000 i guess over load in
sw3765A-ms98-a-0010 22.506000 26.108625 uh cases they say that these drug cases
sw3765A-ms98-a-0011 26.108625 29.485750 alone are swamping the criminal justice system
sw3765A-ms98-a-0012 29.485750 40.006625 [silence]
sw3765A-ms98-a-0013 40.006625 41.604250 i've
sw3765A-ms98-a-0014 41.604250 44.542125 i've heard that i've heard that uh
sw3765A-ms98-a-0015 44.542125 53.363125 yeah i've even heard that the other end of the continuum some judges who are arguing that uh because the system is so over loaded that
sw3765A-ms98-a-0016 53.363125 59.449875 uh they recommend decriminalizing some of these things because the courts can't possibly handle all the cases
sw3765A-ms98-a-0017 59.449875 60.593250 [silence]
sw3765A-ms98-a-0018 60.593250 65.129625 i think its going to be very interesting because its uh
sw3765A-ms98-a-0019 65.129625 69.961250 it's really become a major expense for us as a society
sw3765A-ms98-a-0020 69.961250 75.450125 [silence]
sw3765A-ms98-a-0021 75.450125 76.973625 yeah
sw3765A-ms98-a-0022 76.973625 92.181500 [silence]
sw3765A-ms98-a-0023 92.181500 93.896500 well you know the oth[er]-
sw3765A-ms98-a-0024 93.896500 107.305875 the other thing that i think is interesting about this is that they've been experimenting for years in the civil justice system with alternatives to courts where you can rent a judge and i'm wondering whether we'll eventually go to renting a jury
sw3765A-ms98-a-0025 107.305875 113.232500 um and finding ways uh like The People's Court to try some of these cases
sw3765A-ms98-a-0026 113.232500 118.380375 i think uh the expense is is enormous have you ever sat on a jury
sw3765A-ms98-a-0027 118.380375 123.337000 [silence]
sw3765A-ms98-a-0028 123.337000 126.315500 yeah well it's uh [laughter]
sw3765A-ms98-a-0029 126.315500 132.757125 it's it's a major undertaking i mean people have to give up their work and and a lot of their time
sw3765A-ms98-a-0030 132.757125 141.353500 and uh i- i just think it can overwhelm us pretty easily uh when i hear what people are saying about just the sheer volume of the cases
sw3765A-ms98-a-0031 141.353500 156.005750 [silence]
sw3765A-ms98-a-0032 156.005750 164.365250 well there are a lot of people who think that that that works pretty well and it'll be interesting to see what uh what we go to because it's uh 
sw3765A-ms98-a-0033 164.365250 169.386875 it's push come to shove time as far as i can tell in terms of the sheer volume of this stuff
sw3765A-ms98-a-0034 169.386875 172.351500 [silence]
sw3765A-ms98-a-0035 172.351500 184.381000 yeah oh yeah it's well known and and it's consistent with what you're talking about in terms of the uh approach to uh the uh you know the people once they get through the trials and i guess
sw3765A-ms98-a-0036 184.381000 188.873750 you know we're going to see more and more of this kind of thing i think the jury trial system
sw3765A-ms98-a-0037 188.873750 190.178125 um
sw3765A-ms98-a-0038 190.178125 197.990875 it's gonna to be interesting to see whether or not it becomes more streamlined uh because of the cost involved in that the uh
sw3765A-ms98-a-0039 197.990875 201.763500 the topic is an interesting one because of the um
sw3765A-ms98-a-0040 201.763500 205.234875 uh the price you pay for freedom i guess
sw3765A-ms98-a-0041 205.234875 210.210125 you know the the requirement that that people be given a trial and and
sw3765A-ms98-a-0042 210.210125 215.288375 and then then the issue becomes what do you do once somebody's found guilty i suppose
sw3765A-ms98-a-0043 215.288375 230.566875 [silence]
sw3765A-ms98-a-0044 230.566875 232.509250 y[eah]- [vocalized-noise]
sw3765A-ms98-a-0045 232.509250 234.129125 [laughter-yeah]
sw3765A-ms98-a-0046 234.129125 235.498500 yeah
sw3765A-ms98-a-0047 235.498500 248.561250 [silence]
sw3765A-ms98-a-0048 248.561250 260.570500 yeah have you uh in Dallas uh seen the newspapers ever print the names of people who were uh uh uh picked up as johns uh in under cover operations
sw3765A-ms98-a-0049 260.570500 270.321875 they they they've done that in San Francisco and uh you know it's gonna be interesting to see how all these things change as as we look at the cost of it because
sw3765A-ms98-a-0050 270.321875 283.810875 um that the well there was a guy who won in Pennsylvania uh this Senator Harris Wafford who said you know and and in this country everybody's entitled to a lawyer but not everybody's entitled to a doctor and we must spend
sw3765A-ms98-a-0051 283.810875 298.562000 i don't know what the figure is but jury trials are are just so expensive very very expensive and time consuming and uh so i think that that all of the these things that we're talking about are going to contribute to change and i don't know uh
