sw3762B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 5.488375 no we just uh i guess i'm hot on this subject because we just spent three weeks camping 
sw3762B-ms98-a-0002 5.488375 8.488000 in a recreational vehicle
sw3762B-ms98-a-0003 8.488000 10.994000 we took a tour of Florida
sw3762B-ms98-a-0004 10.994000 13.258625 [silence]
sw3762B-ms98-a-0005 13.258625 18.783500 [laughter-okay] well i was down there visiting the uh the orchid jungle
sw3762B-ms98-a-0006 18.783500 21.167000 there in uh Homestead
sw3762B-ms98-a-0007 21.167000 25.652125 came back with about ten plants that i hadn't planned on [laughter]
sw3762B-ms98-a-0008 25.652125 26.696000 [silence]
sw3762B-ms98-a-0009 26.696000 30.304750 yeah we were down past Miami went down into the Keys
sw3762B-ms98-a-0010 30.304750 36.160000 [silence]
sw3762B-ms98-a-0011 36.160000 45.235375 um well we found it a little bit of a disappointment uh we had expected some nice warm sunny days we got two days above seventy
sw3762B-ms98-a-0012 45.235375 49.736375 and uh we thought the beaches would be nice but uh
sw3762B-ms98-a-0013 49.736375 54.975000 uh well Key West was uh just coral rubble
sw3762B-ms98-a-0014 54.975000 62.174500 and uh we did find Bahia Honda was a fairly nice state park it had a nice beach
sw3762B-ms98-a-0015 62.174500 71.263250 but the water was running about seventy five degrees so it was kind of hard to get the kids to to go in and and snorkel and and do those sort of things
sw3762B-ms98-a-0016 71.263250 82.241625 [silence]
sw3762B-ms98-a-0017 82.241625 83.498000 um-hum
sw3762B-ms98-a-0018 83.498000 92.715875 [silence]
sw3762B-ms98-a-0019 92.715875 94.259000 yeah
sw3762B-ms98-a-0020 94.259000 114.216375 [silence]
sw3762B-ms98-a-0021 114.216375 115.536375 yeah
sw3762B-ms98-a-0022 115.536375 122.228125 [silence]
sw3762B-ms98-a-0023 122.228125 123.470375 hum
sw3762B-ms98-a-0024 123.470375 133.238500 well my uh my wife talks a lot about camping and uh she's taken the girls uh on off to Girl Scout camp a couple of times
sw3762B-ms98-a-0025 133.238500 138.996125 but my idea of camping is in a either an RV or in a th[irty]- thirty five foot sailboat
sw3762B-ms98-a-0026 138.996125 141.474750 [laughter]
sw3762B-ms98-a-0027 141.474750 144.687375 [silence]
sw3762B-ms98-a-0028 144.687375 147.702250 [laughter] right
sw3762B-ms98-a-0029 147.702250 152.495875 [silence]
sw3762B-ms98-a-0030 152.495875 153.980875 yeah
sw3762B-ms98-a-0031 153.980875 161.725625 [silence]
sw3762B-ms98-a-0032 161.725625 167.999000 yeah i did that for a number of years i crewed for a fellow that uh was doing a lot of racing
sw3762B-ms98-a-0033 167.999000 172.494625 and uh and well it was fun it was quite enjoyable
sw3762B-ms98-a-0034 172.494625 177.277625 [silence]
sw3762B-ms98-a-0035 177.277625 178.738250 um-hum
sw3762B-ms98-a-0036 178.738250 187.264000 [silence]
sw3762B-ms98-a-0037 187.264000 188.730000 yeah
sw3762B-ms98-a-0038 188.730000 190.224000 [silence]
sw3762B-ms98-a-0039 190.224000 193.723125 yeah we rented one from uh Cruise America
sw3762B-ms98-a-0040 193.723125 194.818500 [silence]
sw3762B-ms98-a-0041 194.818500 199.997500 uh it was [noise] running about eighty seven dollars a day
sw3762B-ms98-a-0042 199.997500 201.303250 [silence]
sw3762B-ms98-a-0043 201.303250 208.210125 that's cheaper than a hotel and you add uh oh maybe another twenty five dollars for that for a camp site
sw3762B-ms98-a-0044 208.210125 213.500375 and you know the hookup and water and sewage and so forth
sw3762B-ms98-a-0045 213.500375 216.761250 we had a uh thirty two footer
sw3762B-ms98-a-0046 216.761250 217.775875 [vocalized-noise] 
sw3762B-ms98-a-0047 217.775875 218.997375 [silence]
sw3762B-ms98-a-0048 218.997375 223.253250 well it's it's a big truck uh but uh
sw3762B-ms98-a-0049 223.253250 233.454750 when you get that big a truck the uh the fuel economy goes to pot if you try to push it at sixty five and you get pretty decent fuel economy at fifty five
sw3762B-ms98-a-0050 233.454750 246.774250 so uh i just uh had a change of mind set and i would set the uh autopilot on fifty five and just cruise down the highway well everybody else wants to speed so they wind up passing you
sw3762B-ms98-a-0051 246.774250 252.619625 and you just stay in the right lane and there's nobody in front of you and all you have to do is guide it
sw3762B-ms98-a-0052 252.619625 253.495375 [laughter]
sw3762B-ms98-a-0053 253.495375 256.482625 so it's kind of a pleasant way to drive you
sw3762B-ms98-a-0054 256.482625 265.989750 uh i've found that i get there just about as fast as anybody else because there will be some cars that i'll pass two or three times during the day the same one
sw3762B-ms98-a-0055 265.989750 269.004250 [silence]
sw3762B-ms98-a-0056 269.004250 270.267125 [laughter]
sw3762B-ms98-a-0057 270.267125 273.750000 [silence]
sw3762B-ms98-a-0058 273.750000 280.777000 yeah because_1 you go down there and some hotshot will go by you that you know he's got a colorful car that you recognize and
sw3762B-ms98-a-0059 280.777000 287.848125 the next thing you know you know it's lunchtime he's got to stop for lunch and you just holler at your wife to make you a sandwich
sw3762B-ms98-a-0060 287.848125 290.571625 [laughter]
sw3762B-ms98-a-0061 290.571625 291.741500 [silence]
sw3762B-ms98-a-0062 291.741500 298.178000 and uh well we enjoyed it uh one of of places we visited was uh Walt Disney World
