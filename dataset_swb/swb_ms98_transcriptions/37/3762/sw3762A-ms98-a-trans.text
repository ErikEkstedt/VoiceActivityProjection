sw3762A-ms98-a-0024 70.025125 77.821750 yeah well i've never done any motor home camping although uh uh it it is more attractive to me now than it used to be
sw3762A-ms98-a-0025 77.821750 83.735000 when i was a kid uh we used to go camping up in the Ozarks in Arkansas
sw3762A-ms98-a-0026 83.735000 93.314125 and uh [noise] we found a pretty remote campground uh uh actually whenever we first started going to it you had to drive about twenty five miles on a gravel road
sw3762A-ms98-a-0027 93.314125 101.609625 to get back up into it and uh it had uh no electricity and uh it had a hand pump for water
sw3762A-ms98-a-0028 101.609625 114.994875 but it was on a lake that was just crystal clear and we would spend a week up there you know and they had a a little country store about ten miles away that you could get you know minimal provisions so you pretty much had to carry everything you needed with you
sw3762A-ms98-a-0029 114.994875 122.979875 but uh that was it was great fun but since then i honestly have not done much what you could call camping
sw3762A-ms98-a-0030 122.979875 138.208000 [silence]
sw3762A-ms98-a-0031 138.208000 145.500000 yeah well now [noise] yeah you kind of remind me of a friend of mine who who said her idea of roughing it is slow room service
sw3762A-ms98-a-0032 145.500000 147.228125 [noise]
sw3762A-ms98-a-0033 147.228125 153.448000 but uh yeah i've got a uh i've got a friend of mine in Houston who has a forty two foot uh Tartan sailboat
sw3762A-ms98-a-0034 153.448000 162.693625 and uh it which has for me has been the best of all worlds because he's got the expense and i get the pleasure of going out on [laughter-it]
sw3762A-ms98-a-0035 162.693625 167.727750 [silence]

sw3762A-ms98-a-0039 178.246500 187.851375 and uh but no i love to sail and i agree i had never th[ought]- really thought about that as camping before but that i[s]- that is probably one of the [laughter-best] ways to go
