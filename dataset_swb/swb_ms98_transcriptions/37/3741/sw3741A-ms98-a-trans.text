sw3741A-ms98-a-0032 111.499125 124.217875 i i've carried it through i love to read now and and uh that's why we've we've made it a point whenever she brings us a book that we don't you know we always sit down with her right then and read it so that we try and instill that on her that
sw3741A-ms98-a-0033 124.217875 126.707125 that uh it's something good to do but
sw3741A-ms98-a-0034 126.707125 136.499250 yeah it's it's kind of cute because she'll just come and she'll just start you know kind of not whining but just letting us know that it she wants us to read this book and it's the same one over and over and over again it seems like but
sw3741A-ms98-a-0035 136.499250 137.806875 [laughter]
sw3741A-ms98-a-0036 137.806875 141.996375 but i guess like you say she it's something so she at least she gets in the habit

sw3741A-ms98-a-0039 155.747625 161.723250 then they're proud if their kids are in bed by eight you know which means they only get to spend about two hours a day with them and i just kind of wonder
sw3741A-ms98-a-0040 161.723250 162.983000 you know there's
sw3741A-ms98-a-0041 162.983000 168.203375 there's a lot to be said wi[th]- with parents you know for parents spending time with their kids that's for sure

sw3741A-ms98-a-0044 174.989000 185.508000 it's uh i think it's fair to say you get more of a there's a lot more love and they don't have to go elsewhere to find the the attention and stuff if the parents are spending time doing stuff with them
