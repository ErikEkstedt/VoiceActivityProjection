sw3784B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 3.481000 [noise] yeah as far as i'm concerned and
sw3784B-ms98-a-0002 3.481000 14.520625 probably apt that your call's at this time because we just got through watching uh Reasonable Doubts which had a you know capital case in it
sw3784B-ms98-a-0003 14.520625 26.666125 and uh [noise] m[y]- i personally have uh my own feelings about uh the capital punishment is i think it should be mandatory upon a third conviction felony
sw3784B-ms98-a-0004 26.666125 31.347500 mandatory i mean summary execution on the steps that day
sw3784B-ms98-a-0005 31.347500 40.758000 [silence]
sw3784B-ms98-a-0006 40.758000 42.054625 um-hum [noise]
sw3784B-ms98-a-0007 42.054625 56.597125 [silence]
sw3784B-ms98-a-0008 56.597125 57.970875 well
sw3784B-ms98-a-0009 57.970875 63.804750 i- i also firmly believe that no one is beyond reclamation
sw3784B-ms98-a-0010 63.804750 64.815500 [silence]
sw3784B-ms98-a-0011 64.815500 68.011125 but i do know that some people
sw3784B-ms98-a-0012 68.011125 71.533875 almost all people usually die before that point
sw3784B-ms98-a-0013 71.533875 73.332250 they just get too old 
sw3784B-ms98-a-0014 73.332250 74.476875 um 
sw3784B-ms98-a-0015 74.476875 78.568875 as far as capital punishment on on it's own merits
sw3784B-ms98-a-0016 78.568875 82.146500 [noise] i have the trouble with the way it's applied
sw3784B-ms98-a-0017 82.146500 87.132625 i think it should be applied [vocalized-noise] on a little bit more fair manner
sw3784B-ms98-a-0018 87.132625 100.097375 uh [noise] and i've i've said this very often and i believe it to be the a a very true axiom so i would be rather be white rich and guilty than black and innocent
sw3784B-ms98-a-0019 100.097375 107.099125 [noise] because if you're [laughter] if you're black and you kill a white guy you're going to fry period they will kill you
sw3784B-ms98-a-0020 107.099125 113.003500 if you're black and you kill a black guy you know it's you know two hundred hours of community service
sw3784B-ms98-a-0021 113.003500 114.074500 [silence]
sw3784B-ms98-a-0022 114.074500 115.420500 yeah
sw3784B-ms98-a-0023 115.420500 122.130375 well it's a social disease that we have called one upsmanship
sw3784B-ms98-a-0024 122.130375 126.423500 you know we're the majority so we can do whatever the hell we wanna do
sw3784B-ms98-a-0025 126.423500 129.546125 and you're the minority and you're stuck with it
sw3784B-ms98-a-0026 129.546125 131.823750 but uh [noise]
sw3784B-ms98-a-0027 131.823750 143.269625 [noise] you know we had this in the Vietnam war you know we had [noise] you know population of blacks among military people in Vietnam was about eighty percent
sw3784B-ms98-a-0028 143.269625 148.576250 but the population of blacks in the military was about twenty two percent
sw3784B-ms98-a-0029 148.576250 149.620000 [silence]
sw3784B-ms98-a-0030 149.620000 152.398000 the handwriting's on the wall there isn't it
sw3784B-ms98-a-0031 152.398000 154.005000 you know
sw3784B-ms98-a-0032 154.005000 156.704625 [noise] but that's another issue altogether 
sw3784B-ms98-a-0033 156.704625 160.000000 a[s]- as far as capital punishment
sw3784B-ms98-a-0034 160.000000 168.261375 i think that uh ten years on death row is cruel and unusual punishment i think the guy should have ninety days
sw3784B-ms98-a-0035 168.261375 173.572875 and if he can't produce evidence not argument but evidence
sw3784B-ms98-a-0036 173.572875 195.860875 [silence] 
sw3784B-ms98-a-0037 195.860875 202.514125 [noise] well th[at]- that goes back to when uh America was a a colony of England
sw3784B-ms98-a-0038 202.514125 208.197375 in England you went to court you were assumed guilty until proven innocent
sw3784B-ms98-a-0039 208.197375 210.084000 and
sw3784B-ms98-a-0040 210.084000 214.806375 once they found you guilty you know the judge said he's guilty kill him
sw3784B-ms98-a-0041 214.806375 219.583375 well th[ere]- there were some people that uh had a problem with that
sw3784B-ms98-a-0042 219.583375 229.662125 because they found out later on that jeez you know a guy will lie rather than get killed and he'll say you know hey that guy did it you know not me
sw3784B-ms98-a-0043 229.662125 236.167625 and uh or he'll have somebody lie for him you know people lie it's a strange thing but they do that
sw3784B-ms98-a-0044 236.167625 237.592500 and
sw3784B-ms98-a-0045 237.592500 242.143500 to prevent that kind of misuse of power
sw3784B-ms98-a-0046 242.143500 250.306875 they wrote into the Constitution a protection against judicial mishap
sw3784B-ms98-a-0047 250.306875 257.314000 and the judicial mishap in this event would be hey you got the wrong guy look at that guy uh at E Systems
sw3784B-ms98-a-0048 257.314000 260.056375 they were g[oing]- t[o]- they convicted him
sw3784B-ms98-a-0049 260.056375 264.837875 of a robbery that he could not physically have been able to commit
sw3784B-ms98-a-0050 264.837875 274.948750 he was too far away when it happened he had witnesses that were you know they weren't dope dealers they weren't drug fiends they were employees of a
sw3784B-ms98-a-0051 274.948750 282.113125 an establishment that had a very high level of security sensitivity and these were really responsible people
sw3784B-ms98-a-0052 282.113125 287.287500 you know and they convicted this guy because somebody says well he looks like the right guy
sw3784B-ms98-a-0053 287.287500 289.725500 you know they all look the same to me you know
sw3784B-ms98-a-0054 289.725500 292.916625 big lips flat nose yep that was him
sw3784B-ms98-a-0055 292.916625 299.618000 [silence]
