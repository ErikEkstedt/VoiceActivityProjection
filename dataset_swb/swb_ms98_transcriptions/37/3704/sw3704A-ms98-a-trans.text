sw3704A-ms98-a-0002 0.447125 2.618875 what was the topic [laughter]
sw3704A-ms98-a-0003 2.618875 4.062125 [silence]
sw3704A-ms98-a-0004 4.062125 5.737500 i said uh

sw3704A-ms98-a-0006 7.461625 8.556250 [silence]
sw3704A-ms98-a-0007 8.556250 10.088625 yeah
sw3704A-ms98-a-0008 10.088625 16.820375 [silence]
sw3704A-ms98-a-0009 16.820375 20.142500 well that's a good one i hadn't thought about that yeah
sw3704A-ms98-a-0010 20.142500 23.932625 [silence]
sw3704A-ms98-a-0011 23.932625 25.436125 yeah really
sw3704A-ms98-a-0012 25.436125 31.726250 [silence]
sw3704A-ms98-a-0013 31.726250 33.595375 uh oh
sw3704A-ms98-a-0014 33.595375 36.819750 there there was a stigma attached to it
sw3704A-ms98-a-0015 36.819750 40.785750 [silence]
sw3704A-ms98-a-0016 40.785750 43.452500 [vocalized-noise] an[d]- and a necessity
sw3704A-ms98-a-0017 43.452500 44.947625 yeah
sw3704A-ms98-a-0018 44.947625 58.169375 [silence]
sw3704A-ms98-a-0019 58.169375 59.570250 uh-huh
sw3704A-ms98-a-0020 59.570250 63.730625 [silence]
sw3704A-ms98-a-0021 63.730625 72.061875 yeah really i well i hadn't thought about it i can see i- i think if they asked me for a work number i'd just write down my home number you know because that's where you work
sw3704A-ms98-a-0022 72.061875 78.562875 yeah well the thing that i was thinking about uh huh you know social changes i- i thought well
sw3704A-ms98-a-0023 78.562875 86.055875 you know in a lot of different ways i- i think number one just the the makeup of American society how much it's changed i mean uh
sw3704A-ms98-a-0024 86.055875 97.131750 uh i live in Houston but i'm i'm in Miami right now on business and uh i mean in Miami it's i mean honestly English is almost a second language now
sw3704A-ms98-a-0025 97.131750 106.224750 uh you know with all the uh influx of uh [noise] South Americans and uh Cubans and the the Latins are are just uh
sw3704A-ms98-a-0026 106.224750 119.044500 i- i guess a majority in Miami you know o[f]- course in Houston uh you've got the people from Mexico so that's certainly a change in the the fabric of society uh
sw3704A-ms98-a-0027 119.044500 128.452500 the other thing that i was thinking about uh the way that things have changed [vocalized-noise] so dramatically is twenty or thirty years ago uh
sw3704A-ms98-a-0028 128.452500 142.819750 you know air travel was still uh and not that much in the forefront uh uh an[d]- and now i mean it's you know hardly anybody thinks anything about getting on a plane and and going cross country 
sw3704A-ms98-a-0029 142.819750 147.943375 plus the other thing i was thinking about was just the very fact that we're doing what we're doing tonight uh
sw3704A-ms98-a-0030 147.943375 157.634000 you know calling a one eight hundred number having a computer hook us up uh tell us the topic of conversation uh and and we take that rather for granted
sw3704A-ms98-a-0031 157.634000 166.351250 uh you know thirty years ago uh [vocalized-noise] a long distance phone call was a sort of a special event
sw3704A-ms98-a-0032 166.351250 180.120250 an[d]- a[nd]- and you know and it wouldn't be uncommon for it to have been placed through an operator up i don't know if you know i guess you maybe they did have one plus dialing uh in nineteen sixty one but uh i i'm not sure of that
sw3704A-ms98-a-0033 180.120250 184.044750 [silence]
sw3704A-ms98-a-0034 184.044750 185.638750 oh yeah
sw3704A-ms98-a-0035 185.638750 191.402375 [silence]
sw3704A-ms98-a-0036 191.402375 202.017250 that's right and it harks back to the days like i say when when a long distance call was an expensive uh uh [vocalized-noise] i don't want to say a frivolous but it was an extravagant uh event
sw3704A-ms98-a-0037 202.017250 208.934875 and good grief if my parents knew what my long distance bill was every month they'd have a stroke [laughter]
sw3704A-ms98-a-0038 208.934875 222.705625 but you know it's something that i've just i mean i factor that in i mean that's that's part of my budget i mean i expect to have you know a seventy or eighty dollar phone bill and quite frankly am pleased [laughter-if] [laughter-it's] [laughter-anything] [laughter-below] that
sw3704A-ms98-a-0039 222.705625 224.441500 yeah
sw3704A-ms98-a-0040 224.441500 231.888375 [silence]

sw3704A-ms98-a-0043 236.087125 239.495000 [silence]
sw3704A-ms98-a-0044 239.495000 246.481250 oh i've got yeah i mean i've i'm single and i have three televisions you know and i really they're two well
sw3704A-ms98-a-0045 246.481250 256.169375 one of them_1 is primary and the other one i turn on maybe three times a month and i've got another one i bet i haven't turned on in six months i mean it's there you know
sw3704A-ms98-a-0046 256.169375 264.200000 [noise] and i think about it too i have uh uh four telephones [laughter]
sw3704A-ms98-a-0047 264.200000 266.712750 [silence]
sw3704A-ms98-a-0048 266.712750 268.082875 um
sw3704A-ms98-a-0049 268.082875 270.419125 that's right that's right
sw3704A-ms98-a-0050 270.419125 277.337000 [silence]
sw3704A-ms98-a-0051 277.337000 282.444875 yeah uh yeah it almost like uh you know it's a big uh
sw3704A-ms98-a-0052 282.444875 295.110125 issue i've run across a few people before tha[t]- that you know make a make a point uh that uh the fact that they uh don't own a television and of course you know people look at them_1 yeah like yeah you know bu[t]-
sw3704A-ms98-a-0053 295.110125 299.298000 and it's it's it would be really quite frankly even though i am not
