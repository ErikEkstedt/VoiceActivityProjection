sw4326B-ms98-a-0002 0.468250 3.307000 [silence]
sw4326B-ms98-a-0003 3.307000 8.286500 well i'm i'm for it based upon my experience uh in taking
sw4326B-ms98-a-0004 8.286500 12.627125 uh drug tests my uh my past experience in the military
sw4326B-ms98-a-0005 12.627125 18.465000 plus uh my current occupation working uh for a defense contractor here in Massachusetts
sw4326B-ms98-a-0006 18.465000 21.182000 uh i feel that it's uh
sw4326B-ms98-a-0007 21.182000 30.747625 there is some opinions whereas the uh uh people of the mind that uh it's a right to privacy that
sw4326B-ms98-a-0008 30.747625 34.777375 you know it's a it's a bodily function involved and that um
sw4326B-ms98-a-0009 34.777375 40.608250 um people should have a right to protect themselves and so forth but i don't agree i think that
sw4326B-ms98-a-0010 40.608250 46.227125 um it's important particularly for some jobs and some [jog/job] o[ccupations]- job occupations
sw4326B-ms98-a-0011 46.227125 52.973750 that um people can be screened for uh should be screens for uh for drugs through uh drug testing
sw4326B-ms98-a-0012 52.973750 70.998750 [silence]
sw4326B-ms98-a-0013 70.998750 72.233000 um-hum
sw4326B-ms98-a-0014 72.233000 74.984750 [silence]
sw4326B-ms98-a-0015 74.984750 76.316125 right
sw4326B-ms98-a-0016 76.316125 82.568625 [silence]
sw4326B-ms98-a-0017 82.568625 84.180500 yeah
sw4326B-ms98-a-0018 84.180500 98.899125 so i think we're in agreement that that uh uh that it's a good uh it's a good idea in some circumstances the one reservation i have though in that from my exper[ience]- i've taken many urina[lysis]- many drug tests
sw4326B-ms98-a-0019 98.899125 103.826375 some of them random some of them um scheduled
sw4326B-ms98-a-0020 103.826375 108.527250 uh and every time you take one of those tests [laughter-you] [laughter-know] when you're submitting a sample
sw4326B-ms98-a-0021 108.527250 113.919875 there's always in the back of your mind well how are you know people conducting the test
sw4326B-ms98-a-0022 113.919875 126.015750 the labs that are performing the test how adequate uh are those facilities and uh is is always it is it always a chance i know that what they call um the i think it's called the chain of custody
sw4326B-ms98-a-0023 126.015750 137.502500 of the uh the specimens themselves i know in the mi[litary]- in the military particularly they there's a they go to great lengths at protecting the samples before they get to the labs
sw4326B-ms98-a-0024 137.502500 143.409000 but my concern is and i think that that that what needs to be further investigated
sw4326B-ms98-a-0025 143.409000 151.224000 is the uh the standardization and to have some hundred percent insurance that the test that's given
sw4326B-ms98-a-0026 151.224000 159.472875 uh the the the lab that performs the uh the analysis is uh validated in some way you know some standardization because_1 i've heard some horror stories
sw4326B-ms98-a-0027 159.472875 160.846375 you know
sw4326B-ms98-a-0028 160.846375 162.509750 [noise]
sw4326B-ms98-a-0029 162.509750 169.943000 [silence]
sw4326B-ms98-a-0030 169.943000 176.092625 Sixty Minutes did an article on this whole subj[ect]- subject a few uh a few years ago and there was a Air Force Captain
sw4326B-ms98-a-0031 176.092625 177.102000 [silence]
sw4326B-ms98-a-0032 177.102000 182.816125 who uh you know took the test and it came up positive [noise] and the guy swore on a stack of bibles
sw4326B-ms98-a-0033 182.816125 192.226875 now in the military for a for a staff staff NCO which is a a noncommissioned officer but it's a certain rank above i don't know if you're familiar with mil[itary]- military rank structure
sw4326B-ms98-a-0034 192.226875 201.690000 it's a it's a high level of enlisted personnel and officers for those people who show up positive on one drug test they're immediately discharged
sw4326B-ms98-a-0035 201.690000 210.043625 now for certain ranks and below like sergeant and below if you're found positive or come up dirty in a dru[g]- on a on a drug test
sw4326B-ms98-a-0036 210.043625 216.402125 you can be reduced in rank forfeit your pay or if it's a repeat repeat o[ffense]- uh offense
sw4326B-ms98-a-0037 216.402125 218.278000 [noise] then they can discharge you
sw4326B-ms98-a-0038 218.278000 220.653125 but there's this Ar[my]- this this
sw4326B-ms98-a-0039 220.653125 224.307625 Air Force Captain he swore up and down that he didn't do anything
sw4326B-ms98-a-0040 224.307625 224.997500 [noise]
sw4326B-ms98-a-0041 224.997500 232.308375 and they went back and you know few months later to try to investigate the lab and the sample that he had given was destroyed 
sw4326B-ms98-a-0042 232.308375 238.738750 so i- i think you got to be careful with stuff like that that's that's my only concern about the whole issue i think
sw4326B-ms98-a-0043 238.738750 248.615500 [silence]
sw4326B-ms98-a-0044 248.615500 249.835000 yeah

sw4326B-ms98-a-0047 255.972750 264.311875 uh yeah because_1 there's a big thing in in the in the here on the east coast the Boston Police Department uh the Policemen's Association 
sw4326B-ms98-a-0048 264.311875 272.041750 took the uh the Boston Police Department to court because they were uh trying to institute drug tests for the cops here in Boston
sw4326B-ms98-a-0049 272.041750 276.587250 and um they won the Police De[partment]- the the Police Association won
sw4326B-ms98-a-0050 276.587250 277.636125 [noise]
sw4326B-ms98-a-0051 277.636125 281.857500 and i[t]- it was a right to privacy type deal that they approached it and the courts agreed
sw4326B-ms98-a-0052 281.857500 290.589375 [silence]
sw4326B-ms98-a-0053 290.589375 291.996375 yeah
