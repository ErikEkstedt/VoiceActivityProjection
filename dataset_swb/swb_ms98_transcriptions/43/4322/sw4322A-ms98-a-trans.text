sw4322A-ms98-a-0007 27.871875 36.624000 you're not going to get a whole lot of disagreement from me [laughter] none of the people that i talk to on this project disagree with me very much which kind of surprises me
sw4322A-ms98-a-0008 36.624000 38.406125 [laughter]

sw4322A-ms98-a-0014 52.219500 54.891750 [silence]
sw4322A-ms98-a-0015 54.891750 62.299875 well think of how much we have to pay for it i m[ean]- i'm you know i think if it's voluntary you get the people that want to be there
sw4322A-ms98-a-0016 62.299875 72.813000 they'll do well if it's mandatory you get everybody you get people that don't want to don't want to do work like that and they'll goof off or or sell drugs to their coworkers or something like that um
sw4322A-ms98-a-0017 72.813000 85.066000 [silence]
sw4322A-ms98-a-0018 85.066000 86.335750 hum
sw4322A-ms98-a-0019 86.335750 89.668750 [silence]
sw4322A-ms98-a-0020 89.668750 91.661875 yeah i'm
sw4322A-ms98-a-0021 91.661875 103.237250 well think of it ye[ah]- yeah i- i but i wonder about that the the mere fact that it isn't cost effective do you think that that i[f]- if it's not cost effective do you think that people are going to be enthused about it
sw4322A-ms98-a-0022 103.237250 111.773375 [silence]
sw4322A-ms98-a-0023 111.773375 113.867000 well [laughter]
sw4322A-ms98-a-0024 113.867000 121.533500 [vocalized-noise] you've got you've got a far fewer number what percentage of of of people do you think now do something like that um
sw4322A-ms98-a-0025 121.533500 137.056875 [silence]
sw4322A-ms98-a-0026 137.056875 138.288250 hum
sw4322A-ms98-a-0027 138.288250 150.075875 [silence]
sw4322A-ms98-a-0028 150.075875 154.155625 well i don't [laughter] if you need the space i suppose it's cost effective because [laughter]
sw4322A-ms98-a-0029 154.155625 165.249500 you can't get along with the old with with the old one but um [noise] no i- i and it just seems to me that that that once you get everybody involved there's there's what there's eight million is it uh
sw4322A-ms98-a-0030 165.249500 171.429375 uh kids c[ollege]- uh turning eighteen every year i think it's about that might be a little bit lower now but uh
sw4322A-ms98-a-0031 171.429375 181.569375 that's an awful lot to to bring into a program you got to have eight million jobs available you've got to have administrators for eight million jobs that would be tremendously expensive
sw4322A-ms98-a-0032 181.569375 191.540625 not you know not to forget the cost of putting all of those kids in uh i[n]- in in non market uh e[nterprises]-
sw4322A-ms98-a-0033 191.540625 204.052250 enterprises for for for a couple of years uh that's going to delay their entry into the work force delay the time when they can begin paying taxes too so so the impact is going to be double there i um
sw4322A-ms98-a-0034 204.052250 205.925875 just don't see
sw4322A-ms98-a-0035 205.925875 211.679250 [silence]
sw4322A-ms98-a-0036 211.679250 212.883375 no
sw4322A-ms98-a-0037 212.883375 213.231750 [laughter]
sw4322A-ms98-a-0038 213.231750 214.851000 i don't know i
sw4322A-ms98-a-0039 214.851000 216.753375 [noise] i think the
sw4322A-ms98-a-0040 216.753375 228.826250 [silence]
sw4322A-ms98-a-0041 228.826250 238.941125 yeah uh i- i grant to that but if that's the case then it needn't the[n]- then you don't have a m[andatory]- you don't need a mandatory program to bring everybody into national service
sw4322A-ms98-a-0042 238.941125 251.071250 you just need a program for the people that haven't gotten anythi[ng]- gotten anything better to do and i think that might be a good idea although again then you get the kind of people who are likely to sell drugs to their coworkers et cetera
sw4322A-ms98-a-0043 251.071250 254.142500 [silence]
sw4322A-ms98-a-0044 254.142500 255.908125 right
sw4322A-ms98-a-0045 255.908125 260.836875 [silence]
sw4322A-ms98-a-0046 260.836875 266.777000 that's true but but i think that was different uh in at least three respects first of all
sw4322A-ms98-a-0047 266.777000 275.175000 um it was not a mandatory program if you didn't have another job you could join it you were not required to but it was a way to get a paycheck so people did join it
sw4322A-ms98-a-0048 275.175000 288.804500 secondly the time of the depression was just vastly different people were not as cynical about society about government and about the nation as they are now um so they didn't react negatively as many people would today
sw4322A-ms98-a-0049 288.804500 298.946000 and thirdly the economic conditions were different it was a big drain on the Treasury during the depression as well it's not clear that it made it any easier to get out of the depression
