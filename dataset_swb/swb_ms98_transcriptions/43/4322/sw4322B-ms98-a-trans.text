sw4322B-ms98-a-0005 6.848375 15.114875 oh well i think ideally people should want to do that automatically and that they should want to do what
sw4322B-ms98-a-0006 15.114875 16.942750 [silence]
sw4322B-ms98-a-0007 16.942750 25.354250 you know meshes with how they feel and what they're good at and they shouldn't be funneled into a mandatory sort of a thing
sw4322B-ms98-a-0008 25.354250 34.204000 [silence]
sw4322B-ms98-a-0009 34.204000 43.289250 oh well in that case i think what this country needs is a good mandatory program to uh
sw4322B-ms98-a-0010 43.289250 55.093750 you know get people just thinking hey this is normal it's normal to do good you know to be civic minded you know just so they won't you know everybody will just think
sw4322B-ms98-a-0011 55.093750 57.773250 this is the way things are and it
sw4322B-ms98-a-0012 57.773250 71.962000 [silence]
sw4322B-ms98-a-0013 71.962000 85.278625 well i'm not looking at the mandatory uh program as a cost effective way of getting this stuff done i'm looking at it as a way to shape people's psyches into thinking that public service is a good thing 
sw4322B-ms98-a-0014 85.278625 93.995500 of course the program would have to work or else they'll think yeah public service another boondoggle you know they'll be sitting there working on the job doing nothing
sw4322B-ms98-a-0015 93.995500 104.720875 [silence]
sw4322B-ms98-a-0016 104.720875 112.056125 oh well certainly the people that do volunteer to do all sorts of things aren't thinking cost effective
sw4322B-ms98-a-0017 112.056125 120.255625 [silence]
sw4322B-ms98-a-0018 120.255625 128.473375 well i think everything that people you know what do people do they polish their cars right why do they do it because
sw4322B-ms98-a-0019 128.473375 137.517875 they think they're going to be saving lots of money on repainting and having the car last that much longer no because they want it to look really sharp
sw4322B-ms98-a-0020 137.517875 148.579000 not a cost effective thing you know they raise money to build a new church because they want to put eight zillion filigrees there because_1 it's cost effective or because_1 they need the space
sw4322B-ms98-a-0021 148.579000 204.402500 [silence]
sw4322B-ms98-a-0022 204.402500 211.567125 w[ell]- you have to define the purpose of the program you know is there excess labor and that's why you're doing this
sw4322B-ms98-a-0023 211.567125 212.575750 [silence]
sw4322B-ms98-a-0024 212.575750 221.026250 i mean what there's sort of both excess excess bodies available to labor but then there's not enough skilled labor
sw4322B-ms98-a-0025 221.026250 228.608875 so at the same time you have too many people who want to wo[rk]- or too many people who could work and not enough people who can work
sw4322B-ms98-a-0026 228.608875 249.784750 [silence]
sw4322B-ms98-a-0027 249.784750 255.195750 well they did this in uh the depression they invented what the CCC
sw4322B-ms98-a-0028 255.195750 261.082875 and uh they had a whole bunch of people go out west and dig ditches and plant trees and
