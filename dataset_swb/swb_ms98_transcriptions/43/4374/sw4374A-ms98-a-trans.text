sw4374A-ms98-a-0011 29.547375 30.575750 [silence]
sw4374A-ms98-a-0012 30.575750 38.542750 well when when i was married my husband budgeted you know very very tightly
sw4374A-ms98-a-0013 38.542750 46.843875 but then every time there was any uh and he made sure of it if there was any extra money for anything he spent it
sw4374A-ms98-a-0014 46.843875 55.569875 right so you know that that type of budget i didn't func[tion]- you know i didn't uh i felt like i was getting the short end of the stick
sw4374A-ms98-a-0015 55.569875 63.296250 you know so uh but i'm i'm divorced now so i don't even have a bank account
sw4374A-ms98-a-0016 63.296250 73.863000 i have a my the company that i'm working for has a credit union and i put in the credit union every week
sw4374A-ms98-a-0017 73.863000 76.746500 a substantial amount of my check
sw4374A-ms98-a-0018 76.746500 86.598250 and then when i have some extra monthly uh or quarterly bills like insurances and taxes and things like that
sw4374A-ms98-a-0019 86.598250 91.034000 then i draw out of that savings account to cover those extra expenses
sw4374A-ms98-a-0020 91.034000 99.633000 and uh i you know i'm still very uh very tight with my money course i make very little also
sw4374A-ms98-a-0021 99.633000 106.997500 but i couldn't i just couldn't stand the pressure of having a checking account and being concerned about having a check that wasn't covered
sw4374A-ms98-a-0022 106.997500 119.529125 because they're really expensive down here on a you know if you if you misfigure your check you on a ten or twenty dollar check any any size check it could cost you easy fifty dollars to get it
sw4374A-ms98-a-0023 119.529125 121.443750 straightened out
sw4374A-ms98-a-0024 121.443750 125.317500 so and my my budget doesn't ha[ve]- stand for that
sw4374A-ms98-a-0025 125.317500 134.421500 so uh but i've i save uh uh i haven't the last two years i have saved in an IRA every year
sw4374A-ms98-a-0026 134.421500 139.749250 uh saved enough money to to buy an IR[A]- you know to pay for a two thousand dollar IRA every year
sw4374A-ms98-a-0027 139.749250 147.908000 and um i'm in the credit union uh not the credit union the company uh savings and investment plan

sw4374A-ms98-a-0029 154.109125 157.597125 so uh i'm you know i'm uh
sw4374A-ms98-a-0030 157.597125 166.845000 well i'm i'm saving you know i e[ven]- even though i make very little money and and uh you know and me an[d]- it's it's me and my daughter
sw4374A-ms98-a-0031 166.845000 176.385250 and uh so uh you know i'm doing better [laughter-n[ow]-] better i'm came out of of a job that paid very well
sw4374A-ms98-a-0032 176.385250 187.595875 like for down here i made twenty five to thirty thousand a year and my ex made uh under forty

sw4374A-ms98-a-0034 194.439750 197.566125 yes it was tough
sw4374A-ms98-a-0035 197.566125 204.979375 and last year i got a promotion and a raise and and a better [vocalized-noise] different a better job and i made seventeen
sw4374A-ms98-a-0036 204.979375 211.379625 so uh i'm doing better uh and but i'm still saving more money now than i did when i was married
sw4374A-ms98-a-0037 211.379625 220.572625 [silence]
sw4374A-ms98-a-0038 220.572625 227.658250 they do here they you know a lot of people i mean they are and every time they have uh like a car break down
sw4374A-ms98-a-0039 227.658250 238.163125 or their taxes come due or [vocalized-noise] all kinds of stuff they would our credit [vocalized-noise] the credit union at the company that i work for was was more like a loan shark
sw4374A-ms98-a-0040 238.163125 243.624375 it was awful they w[ouldn't]- they didn't have to follow uh regulations of any kind
sw4374A-ms98-a-0041 243.624375 255.183750 and so the people would would every time they had trouble they didn't have to manage their money they'd just have to go sign their life away and and get money from the credit union
sw4374A-ms98-a-0042 255.183750 261.228875 and they just they ended up a lot of them ended up owing more at the credit union than they could then they could ever pay
sw4374A-ms98-a-0043 261.228875 264.156875 and they wouldn't get very much of a paycheck at all
sw4374A-ms98-a-0044 264.156875 270.435750 because of the credit union taking so much out and and they didn't weren't willing to manage their their checks
