sw4381A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 11.341250 [noise] [vocalized-noise] um let's see so what's wrong with our public school system well i think uh i've been talked into that that one of the main problems is non directive education
sw4381A-ms98-a-0002 11.341250 26.272000 where you teach kids to basically have a good self image and assume that if they think good about themselves they will they will learn well for example if you [vocalized-noise] deal with uh math scores uh US math scores are 
sw4381A-ms98-a-0003 26.272000 40.517375 um i don't know seventeenth out of twenty three industrialized nations we're really low i mean i'd be really even surprised if they were that high these are these are scores on standardized tests and yet if you uh give American students the question i am good at math
sw4381A-ms98-a-0004 40.517375 55.068750 they'll rank themselves much higher than will for example Korean students who do much better at math and um [noise] a number of educational theorists uh pre[dominately]- predominately conservative or they're called conservative because they think this i suppose
sw4381A-ms98-a-0005 55.068750 66.015375 say that the problem is that we've gotten away too much from teaching the kids the material and too much into let them let letting them discover what they feel or what they want to learn for themselves
sw4381A-ms98-a-0006 66.015375 72.450375 and that can be seen in you know in math scores it can be seen in sex education where we've had
sw4381A-ms98-a-0007 72.450375 85.649875 twenty years of generally available sex education in this country at the same time we have a rising crisis of teenage pregnancy uh it can be seen in the fact that students cheat a lot more at least admit to cheating a lot more than they used to
sw4381A-ms98-a-0008 85.649875 98.244750 they're not told what's right and what's wrong and they're not taught what they needed to be taught the urge they're they're they're taught to discover their own values and their own interest and if you let a kid do that that's the way to get
sw4381A-ms98-a-0009 98.244750 101.830875 uh you know to get no progress or very little progress

sw4381A-ms98-a-0037 170.296500 183.950875 well i work at NC State University and i do the same thing i spend i spend my own money to buy things that the university you know doesn't provide and i think little things like like transparency pens their transparency pens are pitiful
sw4381A-ms98-a-0038 183.950875 198.461875 i buy my own um i pay my own way on trips because they don't have any travel budget since nineteen ninety now uh i mean some of it comes from grants but what doesn't come from grants i pay pay for myself and in fact my business deductions are thousands of dollars a year more than the two percent
sw4381A-ms98-a-0039 198.461875 212.064500 uh limit so so th[e]- th[e]- same the same is true here but you know i- i ta[lked]- talked to one teacher about that at a wedding reception once and i said she said we need more pay i said yeah but but but what you need even more than that 
sw4381A-ms98-a-0040 212.064500 225.098625 is you need more flexibility to do things the way you see that they should be done and she said yeah i agree with that entirely that the bureaucracy really hamstrings teachers um they they they in many places are just told what textbook to teach from
sw4381A-ms98-a-0041 225.098625 239.743125 whether or not they think it's a good one i mean the decision can be made from a central authority in the state to which is subject to lots of political pressure the teachers don't get to choose themselves what what book to teach uh uh teach from they go don't get to choose what order to cover things in and 
sw4381A-ms98-a-0042 239.743125 252.773500 they really cannot adapt things to their teaching style in in into their kids uh that is a big problem and i think the large part of that problem is due to the educational bureaucracy here i go you know maligning some [laughter]
sw4381A-ms98-a-0043 252.773500 265.605625 some uh amorphous much maligned entity but i really think that that's a serious problem that that there's so many layers of administration to make sure that everything's done right that everybody's rights are respected 
sw4381A-ms98-a-0044 265.605625 277.768875 so forth that there's no flexibility down at the at the at the bottom level and that's what the teachers have to deal with and and by the way that's another reason that their pay is so low because the administrators soak up so much of the budget

sw4381A-ms98-a-0049 286.425375 298.754000 yeah well i think that that one way to solve the problem i mean i- i- you know if anything doesn't work right introduce competition and the the voucher a[pproach]- approach to um to to to paying for
