sw4381B-ms98-a-0002 1.355750 102.840000 [silence]
sw4381B-ms98-a-0003 102.840000 110.751125 are those are are as you talk about that it reminds me of of one problem that i think is probably as far as my perception is the most glaring error
sw4381B-ms98-a-0004 110.751125 124.348750 that is because i know a lot of school teachers i know a lot of par[ticularly]- particularly girls who in like in their their thirties who teach school twenties and thirties and i'm appalled that we have that we pay our teachers so little
sw4381B-ms98-a-0005 124.348750 127.880000 and we give them so much so such a small budget to work with
sw4381B-ms98-a-0006 127.880000 136.587750 and with you know with a virtually nonexistent budget they have to supply decor[ation]- you know things bulletin boards on the rooms things for the kids to practice on textbooks
sw4381B-ms98-a-0007 136.587750 150.885125 and so so so the p[athetic]- the teachers themselves get a pathetic salary and they end up almost across the board taking some of their own money which they don't have and buying school supplies so that they can they can teach their kids and their dedication astounds me
sw4381B-ms98-a-0008 150.885125 151.825000 and i
sw4381B-ms98-a-0009 151.825000 156.864500 i don't know i don't know if we're getting a quality education from [vocalized-noise] teachers who are underpaid
sw4381B-ms98-a-0010 156.864500 164.574250 but i'm sure i'm sure that it it's like uh i work at AT&T and now i- i if i want to spend four hundred dollars um
sw4381B-ms98-a-0011 164.574250 167.372875 i don't even have to i don't have to ask anybody i just go do it
sw4381B-ms98-a-0012 167.372875 170.627250 that's probably the teacher's entire budget for the year if they're lucky
sw4381B-ms98-a-0013 170.627250 278.852500 [silence]
sw4381B-ms98-a-0014 278.852500 283.235000 yeah i think so i oh for example they will have a a million dollar building 
sw4381B-ms98-a-0015 283.235000 285.675500 but no no money for supplies
sw4381B-ms98-a-0016 285.675500 298.754000 [silence]
