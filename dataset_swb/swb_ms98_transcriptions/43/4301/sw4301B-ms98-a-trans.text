sw4301B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 4.390625 [noise]
sw4301B-ms98-a-0002 4.390625 8.360500 [silence]
sw4301B-ms98-a-0003 8.360500 13.399125 [laughter] i think some of them_1 are dishonest and some of them_1 are probably honest mistakes
sw4301B-ms98-a-0004 13.399125 24.500000 it's hard to me to imagine that somebody's going to overwrite uh what what was the largest amount of checks and write out a check for five thousand dollars and not know they're overdrawing their account
sw4301B-ms98-a-0005 24.500000 36.508625 but on the other hand somebody you know making a couple of overdrawing checks probably isn't a major phenomena i think they're under a lot of pressure especially when there's lots of money involved 
sw4301B-ms98-a-0006 36.508625 40.484375 and it's hard to keep them honest when they're there for a long time
sw4301B-ms98-a-0007 40.484375 54.546125 [silence]
sw4301B-ms98-a-0008 54.546125 65.089000 well that bothers me because again we ought to have a government where we can choose who we want and when you you know limit terms and you say well even if people want this person they can't have them
sw4301B-ms98-a-0009 65.089000 68.257375 which is kind of a hard situation too
sw4301B-ms98-a-0010 68.257375 73.388250 [silence]
sw4301B-ms98-a-0011 73.388250 73.980500 [laughter]
sw4301B-ms98-a-0012 73.980500 76.498500 [silence]
sw4301B-ms98-a-0013 76.498500 79.277000 [laughter]
sw4301B-ms98-a-0014 79.277000 82.185750 [silence]
sw4301B-ms98-a-0015 82.185750 85.619250 [laughter] or a lot weird
sw4301B-ms98-a-0016 85.619250 87.965625 [silence]
sw4301B-ms98-a-0017 87.965625 89.308625 yes
sw4301B-ms98-a-0018 89.308625 98.517875 [silence]
sw4301B-ms98-a-0019 98.517875 99.836125 yeah
sw4301B-ms98-a-0020 99.836125 114.133625 [silence]
sw4301B-ms98-a-0021 114.133625 118.223125 well i mean the other problem is is that they're always up for reelection
sw4301B-ms98-a-0022 118.223125 123.577500 so that they're always not making the right decision but the politically correct decision
sw4301B-ms98-a-0023 123.577500 125.035750 [silence]
sw4301B-ms98-a-0024 125.035750 127.619625 and it it i think that's hard for them
sw4301B-ms98-a-0025 127.619625 131.522125 plus when you you put the lobbyist back there i wish somehow we could limit lobbyist
sw4301B-ms98-a-0026 131.522125 133.437500 [silence]
sw4301B-ms98-a-0027 133.437500 137.558875 i think that's a greater problem because they're constantly trying to
sw4301B-ms98-a-0028 137.558875 141.173625 use their influence in not always the most positive ways
sw4301B-ms98-a-0029 141.173625 148.148000 [silence]
sw4301B-ms98-a-0030 148.148000 149.428500 yeah
sw4301B-ms98-a-0031 149.428500 155.640000 [silence]
sw4301B-ms98-a-0032 155.640000 158.065875 no
sw4301B-ms98-a-0033 158.065875 166.542000 [silence]
sw4301B-ms98-a-0034 166.542000 171.118375 uh seems to me somehow if they could draw a straight salary and not have any other benefits
sw4301B-ms98-a-0035 171.118375 172.249375 [silence]
sw4301B-ms98-a-0036 172.249375 180.975125 and you know i don't know what the salary ought to be but i think that would decrease somewhat the the need for the kinds of things that sometimes happen
sw4301B-ms98-a-0037 180.975125 183.712000 [silence]
sw4301B-ms98-a-0038 183.712000 192.903250 well i was shocked i was happened to be reading the voters guide in the last election and a Sen[ator]- a a Representative makes a hundred and twenty nine thousand dollars a year 
sw4301B-ms98-a-0039 192.903250 198.155250 which kind of blew my mind [laughter] ye[s]- yes i'd like to make that much
sw4301B-ms98-a-0040 198.155250 199.745750 [silence]
sw4301B-ms98-a-0041 199.745750 202.421500 uh [laughter-no] [laughter-thanks]
sw4301B-ms98-a-0042 202.421500 209.925500 [silence]
sw4301B-ms98-a-0043 209.925500 213.687625 or rai[se]- they give themselves raises when they're trying to cut government expenses
sw4301B-ms98-a-0044 213.687625 219.096875 [silence]
sw4301B-ms98-a-0045 219.096875 220.481125 yeah
sw4301B-ms98-a-0046 220.481125 230.105875 and the other problem is you know one of the other questions it asked is is is there someway we can make all unethical things illegal and i'm just convinced you can't legislate common sense
sw4301B-ms98-a-0047 230.105875 232.869625 and that seems to be something that a lot of them_1 are missing
sw4301B-ms98-a-0048 232.869625 243.486875 [silence]
sw4301B-ms98-a-0049 243.486875 250.790000 and i think part of the other problem is is because government has such a bad reputation people who might really do well in it
sw4301B-ms98-a-0050 250.790000 253.279125 tend to avoid it
sw4301B-ms98-a-0051 253.279125 256.148625 because of all the negative uh
sw4301B-ms98-a-0052 256.148625 262.741125 feelings about politicians you may have some people who could be do a really good job but they just kind of stay out of it because they don't want
sw4301B-ms98-a-0053 262.741125 265.021750 to be associated with that kind of thing
sw4301B-ms98-a-0054 265.021750 271.904375 [silence]
sw4301B-ms98-a-0055 271.904375 277.496375 [laughter] i don't know little nervous about that one [laughter-too]
sw4301B-ms98-a-0056 277.496375 280.661125 yeah i think he definitely is
sw4301B-ms98-a-0057 280.661125 282.060875 i don't
sw4301B-ms98-a-0058 282.060875 286.174000 [silence]
sw4301B-ms98-a-0059 286.174000 295.769500 i'm just wondering how he would cope with the fact that he can't just do you know sort of looking at the as an outsider at the way he ran his company you either did what he said or you were out
sw4301B-ms98-a-0060 295.769500 298.402000 and i'm not sure as a President you could ever run it that
