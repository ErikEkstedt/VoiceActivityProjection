sw4301A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 9.228625 [noise] well Allen do you think that uh all our politicians are totally dishonest or are they just making mistakes like their uh banking business
sw4301A-ms98-a-0002 9.228625 23.641750 [silence]
sw4301A-ms98-a-0003 23.641750 24.904250 yeah
sw4301A-ms98-a-0004 24.904250 39.786875 [silence]
sw4301A-ms98-a-0005 39.786875 54.454875 oh i think so too and i think that's ju[st]- about the only thing you can do to to clean up government or clean up the political side of government is to kick the bums out [laughter-periodically] limit the terms
sw4301A-ms98-a-0006 54.454875 67.107750 [silence]
sw4301A-ms98-a-0007 67.107750 78.147625 yeah but but the longer they stay i['m]- and i'm [vocalized-noise] assuming we're just talking about Washington politicians i don't know that much about the state government i figure it's pretty rotten too [laughter]
sw4301A-ms98-a-0008 78.147625 82.881750 [laughter] i mean even the city council's are a little weird if you look at Dallas
sw4301A-ms98-a-0009 82.881750 84.484875 [noise]
sw4301A-ms98-a-0010 84.484875 86.581125 yeah but but
sw4301A-ms98-a-0011 86.581125 88.785625 have you been to Washington
sw4301A-ms98-a-0012 88.785625 99.467375 ha[ve]- have you watched those folks in action i mean i visited the House and the Senate and sat there in the gallery and watched those folks up there pontificating to a room full of no one 
sw4301A-ms98-a-0013 99.467375 103.879625 and and it i[t]- [noise] their their posturing their
sw4301A-ms98-a-0014 103.879625 109.414125 i don't know i it it's like their not in the real world or something and maybe that's why they have
sw4301A-ms98-a-0015 109.414125 114.058375 have trouble drawing lines as to what's illegal and what's not
sw4301A-ms98-a-0016 114.058375 117.625250 [silence]
sw4301A-ms98-a-0017 117.625250 119.093750 sure
sw4301A-ms98-a-0018 119.093750 123.832250 [silence]
sw4301A-ms98-a-0019 123.832250 125.197125 yeah
sw4301A-ms98-a-0020 125.197125 132.768375 [silence]
sw4301A-ms98-a-0021 132.768375 133.998500 well
sw4301A-ms98-a-0022 133.998500 140.599250 [silence]
sw4301A-ms98-a-0023 140.599250 149.090750 yes that's true i i think they do things that make it easier for our elected representatives to ha[ve]- to live the good life
sw4301A-ms98-a-0024 149.090750 157.279375 i mean if you if you just look at at what goes on in Washington those folks don't live the same way i do anyway [laughter]
sw4301A-ms98-a-0025 157.279375 165.454000 it's almost like they're royalty of some sort and i think that's why they forget sometimes that laws apply to them too 
sw4301A-ms98-a-0026 165.454000 180.577000 [silence]
sw4301A-ms98-a-0027 180.577000 184.263500 yeah but aren't they making something like a hundred and ten thousand a year
sw4301A-ms98-a-0028 184.263500 193.045000 [silence]
sw4301A-ms98-a-0029 193.045000 194.282750 that's mo[re]- uh
sw4301A-ms98-a-0030 194.282750 197.976000 that's a lot more than i make [laughter] huh huh
sw4301A-ms98-a-0031 197.976000 201.082375 well run for office [laughter]
sw4301A-ms98-a-0032 201.082375 203.184875 [silence]
sw4301A-ms98-a-0033 203.184875 209.843000 yeah the[y]- i i what gets me is when they pass laws and they always manage to exempt themselves from them
sw4301A-ms98-a-0034 209.843000 212.547375 [silence]
sw4301A-ms98-a-0035 212.547375 220.228375 oh yes but i mean is it no wonder that there's not a balanced budget when they can't even handle their own checking accounts
sw4301A-ms98-a-0036 220.228375 221.772375 i don't know
sw4301A-ms98-a-0037 221.772375 229.849750 [silence]
sw4301A-ms98-a-0038 229.849750 231.725625 no probably not
sw4301A-ms98-a-0039 231.725625 233.195375 [silence]
sw4301A-ms98-a-0040 233.195375 236.843375 that's right i they get caught up i think in the
sw4301A-ms98-a-0041 236.843375 243.907500 the glamour and the power and whatnot and probably make bad decisions bad choices sometimes
sw4301A-ms98-a-0042 243.907500 264.463125 [silence]
sw4301A-ms98-a-0043 264.463125 266.227250 that's true
sw4301A-ms98-a-0044 266.227250 272.500375 that's true i wonder i wonder if Ross Perot would get elected how he would behave [laughter]
sw4301A-ms98-a-0045 272.500375 273.577625 [laughter]
sw4301A-ms98-a-0046 273.577625 276.321625 [silence]
sw4301A-ms98-a-0047 276.321625 278.574000 i i think he's an honest person
sw4301A-ms98-a-0048 278.574000 280.715250 [silence]
sw4301A-ms98-a-0049 280.715250 285.878375 uh and he and he certainly has no need to have his hands in anybody else's pockets
sw4301A-ms98-a-0050 285.878375 298.402000 [silence]
