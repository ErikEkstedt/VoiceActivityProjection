sw4347B-ms98-a-0024 144.142250 149.691000 well they got a three year lead time it probably won't start really showing up -[un]til ninety four or [laughter-so]
sw4347B-ms98-a-0025 149.691000 152.072625 [silence]

sw4347B-ms98-a-0028 157.105250 161.943875 the computer industry's where it's really dynamic especially for the consumer
sw4347B-ms98-a-0029 161.943875 165.364250 [silence]
sw4347B-ms98-a-0030 165.364250 174.736875 and can you think of any other industry where in software they uh if the product is upgraded and a better version is put out you'll get a free version in the mail it's like here
sw4347B-ms98-a-0031 174.736875 182.472875 or uh maybe they say well you we know you paid five hundred bucks for this program so send us twenty and we'll give you a really great upgrade

sw4347B-ms98-a-0035 189.110500 200.000000 and the hardware well i mean all the chips that make up the hardware are a commodity and the Macintosh is about the only one that's going it's right forcing IBM and the rest of the DOS world to follow along
sw4347B-ms98-a-0036 200.000000 204.110875 [silence]
sw4347B-ms98-a-0037 204.110875 205.586875 [laughter]

sw4347B-ms98-a-0040 214.110375 221.114125 [silence]
sw4347B-ms98-a-0041 221.114125 225.595500 yeah it it's only an advantage for people who had to use pure DOS
sw4347B-ms98-a-0042 225.595500 227.651875 i mean that's their client base
sw4347B-ms98-a-0043 227.651875 235.542750 [silence]

sw4347B-ms98-a-0046 240.661250 245.044000 Apple's sort of making a [vocalized-noise] and they're ones were growling consumer
sw4347B-ms98-a-0047 245.044000 256.821500 uh need to worry about the Mac they're getting like if you bought a power book straight off a lot of them_1 had to go back they issued a recall because of improper shielding or possibly other problems with the floppy drive
sw4347B-ms98-a-0048 256.821500 260.161125 [silence]

sw4347B-ms98-a-0050 268.246375 273.645625 but uh technically i'm not actually in the industry i don't work for a computer company i'm an abuser [laughter]
sw4347B-ms98-a-0051 273.645625 274.669250 [silence]
sw4347B-ms98-a-0052 274.669250 280.204625 but it's sort of like surfing on the wave of future shock to you know keep up with the changes as they happen
