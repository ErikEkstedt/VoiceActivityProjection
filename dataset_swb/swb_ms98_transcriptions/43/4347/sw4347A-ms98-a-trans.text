sw4347A-ms98-a-0012 50.729875 53.030375 [silence]
sw4347A-ms98-a-0013 53.030375 55.762000 exactly i was reading
sw4347A-ms98-a-0014 55.762000 58.701500 [silence]
sw4347A-ms98-a-0015 58.701500 73.458125 right i was reading something in uh Consumer Reports tonight about that as a matter of fact they were talking about cars uh the car issue just came out and about how yeah you'd like to buy an American car maybe but uh you know the transmission may be made in Japan or whatever
sw4347A-ms98-a-0016 73.458125 83.098000 um like i've got an eighty six Ford Ranger and and i know for a fact that the transmission is made by Mitsubishi you know so it's like what are you going to do you know
sw4347A-ms98-a-0017 83.098000 87.994750 but uh that's the way it is i don't know i i personally feel that uh
sw4347A-ms98-a-0018 87.994750 101.955250 uh if the Japanese cars are better and Americans buy them_1 you know that's the way it goes and you know people man[ufacturers]- American manufacturers should get a clue and you know they should start making quality products and
sw4347A-ms98-a-0019 101.955250 107.175000 [silence]
sw4347A-ms98-a-0020 107.175000 116.622125 that's what i thought too until i saw the Consumer Reports issue uh they've got all the American well all the c[ars]- all the cars rated you know and uh
sw4347A-ms98-a-0021 116.622125 127.811375 essentially i h[aven't]- i don't see much of a trend i mean just like every other time that you look at it the Honda Accords and the Civics are right up there there's nothing wrong with them
sw4347A-ms98-a-0022 127.811375 136.545875 uh and the same thing with most of the other Japanese cars but then again you look at a Ford or especially a Chevy and they're pieces of junk you know
sw4347A-ms98-a-0023 136.545875 145.307625 yeah that's ninety that's eighty six through ninety one but uh i don't know may[be]- maybe they're getting better maybe they're starting to get a clue uh
sw4347A-ms98-a-0024 145.307625 148.721750 [silence]
sw4347A-ms98-a-0025 148.721750 158.614875 yeah that's just it technology that that comes in right now is is probably not going to be imple[mented]- implemented until you know quite a few years down the road but uh
sw4347A-ms98-a-0026 158.614875 161.112250 [silence]
sw4347A-ms98-a-0027 161.112250 166.633625 oh yeah because_1 technology is so uh you know volatile and changing all the time uh
sw4347A-ms98-a-0028 166.633625 173.688500 [silence]
sw4347A-ms98-a-0029 173.688500 175.344625 yeah

sw4347A-ms98-a-0031 181.328750 188.254250 [laughter] yeah it uh th[ey]- they keep up goo[d]- with it pretty quickly and that's that's a real good thing i guess
sw4347A-ms98-a-0032 188.254250 190.539625 um i don't know
sw4347A-ms98-a-0033 190.539625 196.308000 [silence]

sw4347A-ms98-a-0038 210.838000 213.028750 yeah you know almost
sw4347A-ms98-a-0039 213.028750 222.769875 exactly almost is the key word there too you know because_1 i- i really i've used both and i really don't see an advantage of Windows at all uh
sw4347A-ms98-a-0040 222.769875 224.898375 [silence]
sw4347A-ms98-a-0041 224.898375 227.389750 yeah yeah that's just it
sw4347A-ms98-a-0042 227.389750 237.019375 but uh i don't know i'm really i've gotten a little bit out of the the personal computer business just because_1 i don't have one at home i- i do use a Mac at work but uh
sw4347A-ms98-a-0043 237.019375 241.968375 uh i really don't don't do much with it at home but uh

sw4347A-ms98-a-0053 279.588750 285.369125 something that i find uncomfortable is you know you you want to buy something say you want to buy a personal computer
sw4347A-ms98-a-0054 285.369125 295.194875 and you got to think about what kind of memory you want to get and what kind of technology that you want to go for you know let let's take the example of a modem for you know
sw4347A-ms98-a-0055 295.194875 300.770000 okay w[hat]- w[hat]- what baud rate do you get well you know it used to be that you get a twelve hundred baud
