sw4354A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 5.312250 what do you think on uh on a scale of one to ten where would you rate yourself on on gun control
sw4354A-ms98-a-0002 5.312250 12.269000 [silence]
sw4354A-ms98-a-0003 12.269000 15.562000 most and ten being no restrictions at all
sw4354A-ms98-a-0004 15.562000 24.038625 [silence]
sw4354A-ms98-a-0005 24.038625 32.869375 um-hum yeah i think i'd be be somewhere around a four or five myself and yeah it [noise] it seems to me like there's there's
sw4354A-ms98-a-0006 32.869375 39.732375 it's not it's not fair to just kind of do everything all the same with all guns because they're not all the same you know
sw4354A-ms98-a-0007 39.732375 45.497500 like hand guns and g[uns]- uh assault rifles i think are a little bit different than rifles and shotguns
sw4354A-ms98-a-0008 45.497500 47.128750 so
sw4354A-ms98-a-0009 47.128750 70.898625 [silence]
sw4354A-ms98-a-0010 70.898625 73.511875 [laughter]
sw4354A-ms98-a-0011 73.511875 79.375000 and you don't need three hundred rounds a minute to to get hold of a deer and
sw4354A-ms98-a-0012 79.375000 84.945375 and if you did it really wouldn't be worth eating so [laughter] you know
sw4354A-ms98-a-0013 84.945375 86.492375 yeah [noise]
sw4354A-ms98-a-0014 86.492375 98.319750 [silence]
sw4354A-ms98-a-0015 98.319750 99.708500 um-hum
sw4354A-ms98-a-0016 99.708500 114.645250 [silence]
sw4354A-ms98-a-0017 114.645250 120.126625 [laughter] yeah yeah that makes sense that that makes a lot of sense i don't see uh 
sw4354A-ms98-a-0018 120.126625 123.463500 i mean it's not like you're gonna go hey i'll go hunting today
sw4354A-ms98-a-0019 123.463500 127.922375 a[nd]- and usually if you're gonna go hunting it's pretty early in the morning anyway and the store is not gonna be open so
sw4354A-ms98-a-0020 127.922375 138.963750 a three day waiting period makes perfect sense to me [noise] i guess the only real questions then is um is gun control does it does it work i mean can you enforce it
sw4354A-ms98-a-0021 138.963750 170.767875 [silence]
sw4354A-ms98-a-0022 170.767875 172.144000 um-hum
sw4354A-ms98-a-0023 172.144000 182.064000 [silence]
sw4354A-ms98-a-0024 182.064000 183.916875 yeah they don't
sw4354A-ms98-a-0025 183.916875 188.285000 [silence]
sw4354A-ms98-a-0026 188.285000 198.870500 i guess i mean the only thing that i worr[y]- i question is i mean i think if if it was really easy to enforce that it it would be great the only thing that uh that would worry me about it
sw4354A-ms98-a-0027 198.870500 207.240250 is that the only real way that i know to enforce it is if someone commits a crime while having a weapon that's not registered you can tag on a couple of extra years
sw4354A-ms98-a-0028 207.240250 216.421500 but as it is now you put someone in prison and they're out in you know one fifth the time they were sentenced to anyway
sw4354A-ms98-a-0029 216.421500 226.557500 so i mean they're not they're not even staying in prison without the extra years on there much less i don't think they'd be staying any longer with extra years tagged on there
sw4354A-ms98-a-0030 226.557500 252.982500 [silence]
sw4354A-ms98-a-0031 252.982500 262.014750 um-hum i think you might've had the i- i guess i mean i'm that's got to be part of gun control but i like the idea of the uh the waiting period because
sw4354A-ms98-a-0032 262.014750 267.700000 i don't think that i mean i really think that if someone wants to get a gun to commit a crime they're gonna get a gun but uh
sw4354A-ms98-a-0033 267.700000 275.480000 if someone is just like all hot and bothered and and ready to go out and and and get someone just because they're all charged up emotionally
sw4354A-ms98-a-0034 275.480000 280.067125 that a three day waiting period you're not gonna stay that angry for that long
sw4354A-ms98-a-0035 280.067125 282.463250 least i'm not [laughter]
sw4354A-ms98-a-0036 282.463250 285.265250 [silence]
sw4354A-ms98-a-0037 285.265250 286.723750 yeah
sw4354A-ms98-a-0038 286.723750 292.345375 [silence]
sw4354A-ms98-a-0039 292.345375 293.762500 yeah
