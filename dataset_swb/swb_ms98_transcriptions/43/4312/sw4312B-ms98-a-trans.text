sw4312B-ms98-a-0002 0.977000 11.001375 well i have a uh pretty wide taste uh in music ranging from progressive rock to jazz to uh
sw4312B-ms98-a-0003 11.001375 23.180125 lot of different forms of uh music in fact it's easier for me to say uh the types of music that i don't like are opera and uh screaming heavy metal
sw4312B-ms98-a-0004 23.180125 29.702875 [silence]
sw4312B-ms98-a-0005 29.702875 31.305250 [noise] i've
sw4312B-ms98-a-0006 31.305250 39.510500 [silence]
sw4312B-ms98-a-0007 39.510500 40.801125 uh-huh
sw4312B-ms98-a-0008 40.801125 43.189375 [silence]
sw4312B-ms98-a-0009 43.189375 50.642125 oh i don't mind music that's difficult to listen to but uh the the uh 
sw4312B-ms98-a-0010 50.642125 59.694875 basic point of heavy metal wh[ich]- which seems to be music to annoy you is uh gets a little annoying
sw4312B-ms98-a-0011 59.694875 62.947625 [laughter]
sw4312B-ms98-a-0012 62.947625 72.058750 oh lot of stuff that actually has uh ended up becoming popular like uh Nirvana and uh
sw4312B-ms98-a-0013 72.058750 81.958750 oh you know i'm thirty so lot of the stuff i was listening to in my teens like the Clash and and the Sex Pistols and REM
sw4312B-ms98-a-0014 81.958750 90.419375 that sort of stuff uh REM makes me laugh because they've gone from a college radio progressive group to being
sw4312B-ms98-a-0015 90.419375 99.446375 uh you know ultra mainstream at this point and it's not really that they've changed their musical style so much as the stream changed
sw4312B-ms98-a-0016 99.446375 105.861000 [silence]
sw4312B-ms98-a-0017 105.861000 107.282500 uh-huh
sw4312B-ms98-a-0018 107.282500 115.490500 [silence]
sw4312B-ms98-a-0019 115.490500 116.855500 uh-huh
sw4312B-ms98-a-0020 116.855500 119.901250 [silence]
sw4312B-ms98-a-0021 119.901250 133.757250 i think it is uh for a while there music seemed to really ha[ve]- popular music seemed to have uh not a lot of point to it i was really tired of uh
sw4312B-ms98-a-0022 133.757250 145.159250 the Michael Bolton Mi[chael]- Michael Bolton really got on my nerves because he he was making all this money doing mediocre cover tunes
sw4312B-ms98-a-0023 145.159250 156.463375 and i could uh go down to a bar that's about three minutes from my house and hear people doing covers better than him not making nearly as much money
sw4312B-ms98-a-0024 156.463375 159.315500 [silence]
sw4312B-ms98-a-0025 159.315500 160.835750 i guess
sw4312B-ms98-a-0026 160.835750 164.510250 [silence]
sw4312B-ms98-a-0027 164.510250 167.395625 th[at]- that and a marvelous hairdo
sw4312B-ms98-a-0028 167.395625 169.450875 [laughter]
sw4312B-ms98-a-0029 169.450875 177.416500 [silence]
sw4312B-ms98-a-0030 177.416500 179.672875 [laughter]
sw4312B-ms98-a-0031 179.672875 183.822875 [silence]
sw4312B-ms98-a-0032 183.822875 185.239875 uh-huh
sw4312B-ms98-a-0033 185.239875 186.837125 [silence]
sw4312B-ms98-a-0034 186.837125 191.926125 well i[t's]- it's interesting because you were you were saying that you liked classical music
sw4312B-ms98-a-0035 191.926125 197.236750 and i like a lot of classical music but i also dislike
sw4312B-ms98-a-0036 197.236750 207.734875 uh some classical music and what gets me even more is the attitude of people who are really into classical music
sw4312B-ms98-a-0037 207.734875 214.443375 and feel that if if it's not seventy five years old it hasn't stood the test of time
sw4312B-ms98-a-0038 214.443375 219.078375 [silence]
sw4312B-ms98-a-0039 219.078375 231.370500 uh stuff that i like uh i like Bach i tolerate Vivaldi i can't stand uh uh Debussy or Debussy
sw4312B-ms98-a-0040 231.370500 231.975250 [laughter]
sw4312B-ms98-a-0041 231.975250 243.460250 uh uh i like Tchaikovsky he can make a lot of noise when he's uh so inclined uh and some of some
sw4312B-ms98-a-0042 243.460250 244.546250 [silence]
sw4312B-ms98-a-0043 244.546250 252.119250 stuff that i like uh for instance Frank Zappa has done a fair amount of orchestral composition
sw4312B-ms98-a-0044 252.119250 260.435500 and that's interesting music but it would not get performed by any uh municipally funded
sw4312B-ms98-a-0045 260.435500 269.858375 uh philharmonic uh just because number one it's Frank Zappa and he's weird number two isn't he still alive
sw4312B-ms98-a-0046 269.858375 279.023625 you know we're we're much better off playing uh Beethoven's ninth that's right you know w[e'll]- we'll do we'll do the ninth and everyone will know it and and hum it
sw4312B-ms98-a-0047 279.023625 283.134000 and i[t]- it it just isn't chance taking enough for me
sw4312B-ms98-a-0048 283.134000 290.936375 uh i feel that uh that that music should take chances in one way or another
sw4312B-ms98-a-0049 290.936375 299.522000 and that uh you know if you've heard a piece oh a hundred a hundred times
