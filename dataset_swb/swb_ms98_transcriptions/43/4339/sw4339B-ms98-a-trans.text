sw4339B-ms98-a-0003 7.176625 14.591000 uh fantasizing about can't do it right now our situation is that we're a two car family
sw4339B-ms98-a-0004 14.591000 23.471500 and i have a mini van we bought a few years ago it's got a uh five year loan so that's still got a couple years to run
sw4339B-ms98-a-0005 23.471500 30.499500 and the car i get to drive is a uh Nissan Sentra that's gonna be ten years old next month so
sw4339B-ms98-a-0006 30.499500 34.509875 i think about uh sprucing that up in a couple years when i can
sw4339B-ms98-a-0007 34.509875 38.792250 [silence]
sw4339B-ms98-a-0008 38.792250 51.018750 well [noise] since i just turned forty i'm thinking [laughter-about] a forty year old man's car's something uh something real sporty but uh realistically with uh
sw4339B-ms98-a-0009 51.018750 62.672625 the need to take the kids to school probably have to have something that uh wouldn't wind up putting their knees in their throat when they sat in the backseat something a little seating room
sw4339B-ms98-a-0010 62.672625 64.495750 how about_1 you
sw4339B-ms98-a-0011 64.495750 71.368375 [silence]

sw4339B-ms98-a-0013 72.617250 86.147375 [silence]
sw4339B-ms98-a-0014 86.147375 87.401750 sure
sw4339B-ms98-a-0015 87.401750 103.294500 [silence]
sw4339B-ms98-a-0016 103.294500 104.574375 sure
sw4339B-ms98-a-0017 104.574375 117.953875 [silence]
sw4339B-ms98-a-0018 117.953875 124.001000 yeah i'm surprised to hear that the V-8s are coming back uh they've got some pretty powerful 6s
sw4339B-ms98-a-0019 124.001000 125.758250 and uh
sw4339B-ms98-a-0020 125.758250 131.854375 you know V-8s seem to be a return of the days of you know ten or twelve miles a gallon
sw4339B-ms98-a-0021 131.854375 151.809625 [silence]
sw4339B-ms98-a-0022 151.809625 153.030000 sure
sw4339B-ms98-a-0023 153.030000 155.594000 [silence]
sw4339B-ms98-a-0024 155.594000 160.011625 is uh traction much of an issue for you up there terms of
sw4339B-ms98-a-0025 160.011625 167.977500 [silence]
sw4339B-ms98-a-0026 167.977500 177.625000 [laughter] actually uh pretty good way of looking at it yeah we uh we had a small accident with our mini van
sw4339B-ms98-a-0027 177.625000 187.795125 a few years ago a case where there was a sort of freak ice storm and we weren't aware of it and just slipped on some black ice and went into another car and 
sw4339B-ms98-a-0028 187.795125 196.231125 this is a rear wheel drive model so we got some monster studded snow tires after that haven't had any problem since 
sw4339B-ms98-a-0029 196.231125 197.586375 [silence]
sw4339B-ms98-a-0030 197.586375 199.287000 it's a Mazda
sw4339B-ms98-a-0031 199.287000 204.094250 and uh we're pleased with it in terms of comfort and uh
sw4339B-ms98-a-0032 204.094250 212.818000 driveability fuel economy isn't great being a minivan but uh it's real nice for carrying around our kids and others and 
sw4339B-ms98-a-0033 212.818000 225.317000 it's uh got some nice features in terms of being able to remove seats and flip them_1 around so we've been able to do some real creative uh load hauling when called upon
sw4339B-ms98-a-0034 225.317000 228.196875 [silence]
sw4339B-ms98-a-0035 228.196875 229.433375 uh-huh
sw4339B-ms98-a-0036 229.433375 231.769375 [silence]

sw4339B-ms98-a-0038 232.997625 255.347625 [silence]
sw4339B-ms98-a-0039 255.347625 264.998125 yeah i think that we're gonna be uh owning a mini van for some years to come probably till the kids are out of uh high school anyway
sw4339B-ms98-a-0040 264.998125 268.977125 [silence]
sw4339B-ms98-a-0041 268.977125 276.282750 uh [noise] i'd be satisfied with a a good front wheel drive car when it comes time to replace the Sentra
sw4339B-ms98-a-0042 276.282750 290.191250 and even as as light as that is with uh the small tires it's it's done pretty well in winter uh again like you if conditions are are that bad i probably don't wanna be driving anyway
sw4339B-ms98-a-0043 290.191250 298.466000 so i know i'd be happy with a a reasonable uh four door you know again we've we've got the same issue with getting kids into the
