sw4339A-ms98-a-0023 63.541750 72.037375 well i think the next car we get will probably be a [noise] well i- i like Buicks we have a Buick Century now it's a nineteen eighty seven
sw4339A-ms98-a-0024 72.037375 79.922750 and uh whatever i get i wanna have uh air bags uh both driver's and passenger side and a four door because
sw4339A-ms98-a-0025 79.922750 94.495875 it's much more convenient if you're carrying anybody to you know rather than have them_1 stoop down to get over so i think the four door is probably a major requirement and other than that uh you know reasonable cost and 
sw4339A-ms98-a-0026 94.495875 98.930625 safety and uh as much economy as you can get out of a car 
sw4339A-ms98-a-0027 98.930625 100.311000 uh
sw4339A-ms98-a-0028 100.311000 108.747250 you know i'm not looking for one with a great big engine uh something that'll carry it around safely i guess is best best way to describe it
sw4339A-ms98-a-0029 108.747250 118.859625 right now we've got a V-6 in it and that seems to be just fine i know they s[aid]- they're coming out with some V-8s now and i think that's probably a little overkill for this day and age

sw4339A-ms98-a-0035 140.321125 148.551750 it's handy to haul things uh it's not related to my business i just you really use it basically for transportation but there's so many occasions when i've had to 
sw4339A-ms98-a-0036 148.551750 155.546125 move some members of the family or do this or that it's it's handy to have a truck and not have to borrow one [noise]

sw4339A-ms98-a-0055 232.253625 242.280000 and uh they have a a child that's five years old and it's really handy for hauling him around and and their stuff and of course as he gets friends i'm sure that'll
sw4339A-ms98-a-0056 242.280000 255.411250 be even handier so i know if we were if we had kids still at home we're in our fifties now but if we had kids still at home we'd certainly have to seriously consider a van just for their functional value
