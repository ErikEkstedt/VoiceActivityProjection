sw4372B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 8.740375 [noise] so let's talk about the uh wonderful abuses in the State of Pennsylvania of personal property taxes whereby you can purchase something mail order
sw4372B-ms98-a-0002 8.740375 19.530875 and after the fact the State of Pennsylvania can find out about it and send you a bill for the sales tax appropriate to that item that you purchased as well as interest and penalties from the time that you bought it
sw4372B-ms98-a-0003 19.530875 22.845750 what do you think is Pennsylvania kind of out of line there
sw4372B-ms98-a-0004 22.845750 36.690875 [silence]
sw4372B-ms98-a-0005 36.690875 47.261750 what what if you're not doing it in order to circumvent the law though i mean what if you don't even realize that you're subject to paying um income tax on something that you purchase mail order
sw4372B-ms98-a-0006 47.261750 77.358625 [silence]
sw4372B-ms98-a-0007 77.358625 79.790750 well i mean it seems to me that
sw4372B-ms98-a-0008 79.790750 88.286000 generally at least in my own experience when i purchase something mail order it's not to circumvent paying sales tax to the State of Pennsylvania it's because
sw4372B-ms98-a-0009 88.286000 100.012000 i'm sorry the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania uh it's because i- i can't find the item that i want at a competitive price anywhere in my local area so i go outside the area for that
sw4372B-ms98-a-0010 100.012000 107.265250 and i think that it's not my responsibility to police myself and pay Pennsylvania what they believe they are owed
sw4372B-ms98-a-0011 107.265250 115.741375 even though you know the revenue stream went to another state i don't i don't think that that's my responsibility as a as a conscientious consumer
sw4372B-ms98-a-0012 115.741375 148.319250 [silence]
sw4372B-ms98-a-0013 148.319250 161.681250 well i think that if if policy is established and if a mechanism is put into place to promote the collection of taxes in this fashion
sw4372B-ms98-a-0014 161.681250 174.362500 then i don't argue with it because it's not a burden on the consumer to remember that oh i bought this out of state i need [noise] to Xerox the receipt and make out a check for six percent and send it to Pennsylvania
sw4372B-ms98-a-0015 174.362500 175.996375 [silence]
sw4372B-ms98-a-0016 175.996375 190.051125 right but the point is is that businesses do that the business that you purchase the thing from is responsible for collecting the appropriate sales tax and forwarding it to the state in question that's a cost of doing business the burden shouldn't be placed on the consumer
sw4372B-ms98-a-0017 190.051125 194.628750 [silence]
sw4372B-ms98-a-0018 194.628750 195.941500 ah
sw4372B-ms98-a-0019 195.941500 209.907000 [silence]
sw4372B-ms98-a-0020 209.907000 218.987500 uh do you mean businesses from the point of view as of of selling things to a consumer and then being responsible for the sales tax
sw4372B-ms98-a-0021 218.987500 221.056250 or purchasing
sw4372B-ms98-a-0022 221.056250 244.058000 [silence]
sw4372B-ms98-a-0023 244.058000 249.337875 yeah see i'm unfamiliar with that because i don't i never see that end of the business
sw4372B-ms98-a-0024 249.337875 253.801750 so my only experience has been from the point of view of a consumer
sw4372B-ms98-a-0025 253.801750 254.982875 [silence]
sw4372B-ms98-a-0026 254.982875 264.719500 um but if that's the case if the business is responsible for policing themselves then i think some well defined mechanisms need to be in place so that
sw4372B-ms98-a-0027 264.719500 272.233000 um the opportunity f[or]- to forget that you owe sales tax for something uh can be avoided
sw4372B-ms98-a-0028 272.233000 298.466000 [silence]
