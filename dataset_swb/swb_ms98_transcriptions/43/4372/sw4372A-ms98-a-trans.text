sw4372A-ms98-a-0003 21.531625 32.428250 well actually i don't think they're out of line De[vil's]- Devil's advocate possibly but it you are trying to avoid paying taxes and wheth[er]- whether or not you agree with that law
sw4372A-ms98-a-0004 32.428250 37.351875 i[t]- you're still circumventing it you are legal in in your circumvention of that law
sw4372A-ms98-a-0005 37.351875 47.285750 [silence]
sw4372A-ms98-a-0006 47.285750 61.350250 uh really i- i- i don't think that's a valid argument i think that most people are quite aware they're not paying that six percent sales tax um s[ome]- naturally some some things you just can't find in your local KMart or or [noise] um
sw4372A-ms98-a-0007 61.350250 64.791250 Bryn Mawr stereo dealer um but
sw4372A-ms98-a-0008 64.791250 77.367250 th[en]- th[en]- then why not pay pay the sales tax to Pennsylvania corporations have to why should an individual just because it's just because the state can't really find out about it be able to avoid paying sales tax

sw4372A-ms98-a-0012 115.609500 119.418375 i i'll agree it it's not your responsibility but
sw4372A-ms98-a-0013 119.418375 122.720250 i[s]- b[ut]- is it also legal
sw4372A-ms98-a-0014 122.720250 135.558750 for you to do that w[hat]- w[hat]- fr[om]- from what i understand from v[arious]- v[arious]- various net readings i[t]- i[t]- it the federal government is going to try to legislate a more aggressive enforcement of state
sw4372A-ms98-a-0015 135.558750 149.083000 tax schemes um in into place in the next few years it is it is a lost revenue stream right now and states c[an]- can use all the revenue they can get with some with something like that w[ill]- do your arguments still apply
sw4372A-ms98-a-0016 149.083000 173.505375 [silence]
sw4372A-ms98-a-0017 173.505375 176.632125 which is exactly what businesses do at the present

sw4372A-ms98-a-0021 195.122875 196.249125 [silence]
sw4372A-ms98-a-0022 196.249125 204.815000 that's my understanding of the way um the way it works usually the the person ordering it doesn't pay but the accounting department will uh suck up all the bills at the end of the month and realize how much they have to pay
sw4372A-ms98-a-0023 204.815000 210.581500 and there r[easons]- there are s[ome]- some substantial nasty penalties um if you if businesses try to avoid that
sw4372A-ms98-a-0024 210.581500 215.375375 [silence]
sw4372A-ms98-a-0025 215.375375 217.600000 a as if
sw4372A-ms98-a-0026 217.600000 220.560375 no businesses um if
sw4372A-ms98-a-0027 220.560375 230.429500 purchasing things mail order if i if i'm a computer consulting firm and i see these this great deal on forty eighty six motherboards uh from from say Utah um
sw4372A-ms98-a-0028 230.429500 237.457750 i- i might buy the motherboards from Utah but then still have to pay some Pennsylvania sales tax my a[partment]- accounting department will at the end of the month
sw4372A-ms98-a-0029 237.457750 238.639000 [silence]
sw4372A-ms98-a-0030 238.639000 244.480750 uh i think that [noise] i think that's the way things work in Pennsylvania and i know they work that way in uh say here in DC 
sw4372A-ms98-a-0031 244.480750 248.661250 [silence]

sw4372A-ms98-a-0033 250.006625 272.967000 [silence]
sw4372A-ms98-a-0034 272.967000 286.716375 that's true i[s]- i[s]- a r[eal]- a big hole does exist right now uh in that consumers can just say oh i- i forgot that there there is no well defined mechanism at all and and that it is a [noise] a a loss i- i think
sw4372A-ms98-a-0035 286.716375 298.466000 is that the federal government will try to establish a mechanism jus[t]- just to do just that in order in order to gain the revenue that's being lost um and i- i don't know if i agree with that but it b[ut]-
