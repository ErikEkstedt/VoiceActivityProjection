sw4358B-ms98-a-0005 33.464375 44.297750 well here they and uh live in an apartment complex and they only have one set of recycling bins one or two sets
sw4358B-ms98-a-0006 44.297750 56.210000 as opposed to a set at each of the dumpsters so a lot of the people who live up front don't bother to recycle because you know it's too far to carry the stuff to the other bins
sw4358B-ms98-a-0007 56.210000 95.734500 [silence]
sw4358B-ms98-a-0008 95.734500 98.113125 right they

sw4358B-ms98-a-0010 99.262000 108.701250 th[ey're]- here they're trying to push through a bill and a lot of people are against it and it's going to create a lot more work for the uh
sw4358B-ms98-a-0011 108.701250 118.079875 the stores that sell you know sodas and stuff because they want to implement a refund on cans and on plastic bottles and everything
sw4358B-ms98-a-0012 118.079875 159.877000 [silence]
sw4358B-ms98-a-0013 159.877000 163.950125 right i think here that if they uh 
sw4358B-ms98-a-0014 163.950125 174.686375 instead of just you know requiring that you put put out the trash and stuff if they could get some kind of rebate those people who do put the stuff out uh
sw4358B-ms98-a-0015 174.686375 182.353000 you know and separate it have lower collection fee or something may encourage people to separate
sw4358B-ms98-a-0016 182.353000 221.135750 [silence]
sw4358B-ms98-a-0017 221.135750 228.940125 uh i know uh i believe it was last year that they actually collected the old phone books uh
sw4358B-ms98-a-0018 228.940125 240.731125 usually have them come from [vocalized-noise] you know projects to collect old ones usually just get dumped out with the trash and phone books are a large volume of annual [laughter]
sw4358B-ms98-a-0019 240.731125 242.436250 trash
sw4358B-ms98-a-0020 242.436250 272.901625 [silence]
sw4358B-ms98-a-0021 272.901625 284.034375 well part of the problem with recycling them in the past has been the covers are made with a clay based paper they contain the glue and stuff and they used to have to take out all the
sw4358B-ms98-a-0022 284.034375 289.283625 uh pages and then cut the spine off to be able to recycle them
sw4358B-ms98-a-0023 289.283625 294.386125 now i think they've come up with some way of uh pulling the glue out
sw4358B-ms98-a-0024 294.386125 299.234000 [silence]
