sw4358A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 4.318125 [noise] okay what is your uh community uh currently doing with regard to recycling
sw4358A-ms98-a-0002 4.318125 14.765750 [silence]
sw4358A-ms98-a-0003 14.765750 24.168625 uh-huh [noise] well that's more than we have up here in Massachusetts some some local communities are very active in that uh in that respect and they do have bins set up but
sw4358A-ms98-a-0004 24.168625 32.161000 i live in a a metropolitan area and uh they're not uh too inclined to do something as aggressive as that
sw4358A-ms98-a-0005 32.161000 37.652375 [silence]
sw4358A-ms98-a-0006 37.652375 38.822500 uh-huh
sw4358A-ms98-a-0007 38.822500 55.885750 [silence]
sw4358A-ms98-a-0008 55.885750 67.320750 i i know a lot i think a lot of uh the the issues with regard to recycling are that uh people have to be motivated to do to do something like that because it does take extra effort 
sw4358A-ms98-a-0009 67.320750 74.912500 whether and and i think that and i know Massachusetts has a bottle bill was passed and we have had a bottle bill for quite a few years now
sw4358A-ms98-a-0010 74.912500 86.723750 and the majority of the incentive in recycling bottles probably believe it or not is just to get the extra nickel at the uh the store and not uh that's the majority of people that i know of anyways
sw4358A-ms98-a-0011 86.723750 96.255250 where people aren't really you know ecoconscious it's just the fact that it's something they have to do and i'm not going to throw a bottle away it's like throwing a nickel away that type of thing
sw4358A-ms98-a-0012 96.255250 99.468125 but uh people need to be more conscious of it
sw4358A-ms98-a-0013 99.468125 117.115875 [silence]
sw4358A-ms98-a-0014 117.115875 130.377750 yeah [noise] no it it didn't it it took awhile for that bill to be passed up here as far as recycling bottles and cans um and and matter of fact i think it took like three tries t[o]- for it to go through 
sw4358A-ms98-a-0015 130.377750 140.928875 but and it's been pretty successful and people notice it as far as uh highways being uh you know people would dr[ink]- have a drink of soda instead of throwing out the window they they keep the bottle so
sw4358A-ms98-a-0016 140.928875 155.612375 it's it's been a ecologically sound policy and you know as as far as recycling your bottles in terms of trash and so forth but more importantly it's recycling reusable materials back into uh manufacturing
sw4358A-ms98-a-0017 155.612375 159.257250 and that's the big thing i think that th[ey]- they try to promote
sw4358A-ms98-a-0018 159.257250 177.708000 [silence]
sw4358A-ms98-a-0019 177.708000 179.621875 yeah that's a good idea
sw4358A-ms98-a-0020 179.621875 181.199250 yeah
sw4358A-ms98-a-0021 181.199250 182.215750 [silence]
sw4358A-ms98-a-0022 182.215750 189.091375 th[ere]- there definitely has to be a motivation factor and i know that at wh[ere]- where i work i work for a defense contractor
sw4358A-ms98-a-0023 189.091375 199.300125 and there's a big push on for recycling uh paper materials you know computer output paper and also to decrease the amount of uh styrofoam usage
sw4358A-ms98-a-0024 199.300125 207.184250 because of the uh the process involved in styrofoam and and the whole eco issue and that and and they're very proactive and uh
sw4358A-ms98-a-0025 207.184250 220.520000 uh matter of fact they give you discounts if you use uh you know uh uh china wear rather than uh styrofoam stuff so so i[t]- i[t]- it's incentives like that that get people people more conscious of it i think that's that's what they need to do be more proactive like that 
sw4358A-ms98-a-0026 220.520000 241.451625 [silence]
sw4358A-ms98-a-0027 241.451625 253.631750 yeah they they just matter of fact that that reminded me of an article i saw in the pa[per]- the local schools you could send your phone book to your uh to with your kid to school and what they'll do is they'll recycle it
sw4358A-ms98-a-0028 253.631750 257.196250 because there was an article or a story done awhile ago that uh
sw4358A-ms98-a-0029 257.196250 269.658625 [noise] trash uh the telephone books are the type of thing that don't break down over a long period of time a guy went to a d[ump]- a landfill dug down five feet and and pulled up a phone book from like nineteen sixty
sw4358A-ms98-a-0030 269.658625 273.782000 because they don't they don't degrade over such a period of time
sw4358A-ms98-a-0031 273.782000 279.918875 [silence]
sw4358A-ms98-a-0032 279.918875 281.118875 yeah
sw4358A-ms98-a-0033 281.118875 288.782500 [silence]
sw4358A-ms98-a-0034 288.782500 290.068125 yeah
sw4358A-ms98-a-0035 290.068125 293.995875 [silence]
sw4358A-ms98-a-0036 293.995875 295.239625 yeah
sw4358A-ms98-a-0037 295.239625 296.944125 [silence]
sw4358A-ms98-a-0038 296.944125 299.234000 okay
