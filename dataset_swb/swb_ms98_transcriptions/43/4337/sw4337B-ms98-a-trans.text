sw4337B-ms98-a-0003 2.403625 5.871125 so uh what do you think about uh
sw4337B-ms98-a-0004 5.871125 12.973750 uh how trials in America are right now with the jury of nine or twelve do you think that's fair
sw4337B-ms98-a-0005 12.973750 20.611750 [silence]
sw4337B-ms98-a-0006 20.611750 21.872000 um-hum
sw4337B-ms98-a-0007 21.872000 24.322375 [silence]
sw4337B-ms98-a-0008 24.322375 25.586750 uh-huh
sw4337B-ms98-a-0009 25.586750 33.937875 [silence]
sw4337B-ms98-a-0010 33.937875 35.405625 um-hum
sw4337B-ms98-a-0011 35.405625 45.080875 so you think that um majority r[ule]- majority rule is good enough for um deciding on a verdict of guilty or not guilty
sw4337B-ms98-a-0012 45.080875 46.289625 um-hum
sw4337B-ms98-a-0013 46.289625 47.298875 [silence]
sw4337B-ms98-a-0014 47.298875 58.883375 um something that's kind of interesting is uh i lived in Europe for a while and um in Germany they don't have trial by jury they have trial uh by
sw4337B-ms98-a-0015 58.883375 61.091375 usually three judges
sw4337B-ms98-a-0016 61.091375 61.547875 [noise]
sw4337B-ms98-a-0017 61.547875 74.843375 and uh i've discussed with people and it's it's kind of interesting uh kind of an interesting concept it sounds strange at first not to have a jury by your peers but then um the argument for it
sw4337B-ms98-a-0018 74.843375 76.558375 is that
sw4337B-ms98-a-0019 76.558375 78.489375 um you know
sw4337B-ms98-a-0020 78.489375 82.553875 people off the street really don't know much about law
sw4337B-ms98-a-0021 82.553875 85.916625 and yeah and and then uh
sw4337B-ms98-a-0022 85.916625 99.062750 i guess the argument is that they're easily influenced you know by by tricks by lawyers you know who [dos/do] do more psychology than trying to teach them what's right and wrong and the law they they use uh
sw4337B-ms98-a-0023 99.062750 101.890375 you know techniques to sway their feelings whereas
sw4337B-ms98-a-0024 101.890375 103.334625 professional
sw4337B-ms98-a-0025 103.334625 104.566625 judges
sw4337B-ms98-a-0026 104.566625 105.782125 um
sw4337B-ms98-a-0027 105.782125 108.418500 you know know the ins and outs of the system better
sw4337B-ms98-a-0028 108.418500 118.891375 [silence]

sw4337B-ms98-a-0037 131.569000 132.995125 uh-huh
sw4337B-ms98-a-0038 132.995125 134.486375 no
sw4337B-ms98-a-0039 134.486375 135.933000 no couldn't 
sw4337B-ms98-a-0040 135.933000 138.162875 [silence]
sw4337B-ms98-a-0041 138.162875 139.486250 right
sw4337B-ms98-a-0042 139.486250 147.740500 yeah definitely i don't know i think the that the um alternative is something interesting to look into uh
sw4337B-ms98-a-0043 147.740500 150.718875 if y[ou]- you know instead of
sw4337B-ms98-a-0044 150.718875 154.209500 instead of juries just by by uh
sw4337B-ms98-a-0045 154.209500 158.226000 uh peers juries by professional judges
sw4337B-ms98-a-0046 158.226000 161.204500 um but i guess uh
sw4337B-ms98-a-0047 161.204500 164.508000 that would take a major constitutional change here [laughter]
sw4337B-ms98-a-0048 164.508000 167.341500 [silence]
sw4337B-ms98-a-0049 167.341500 177.559500 right um i mean i see also how they were you know when they made the constitution they were uh afraid of that kind of thing that you know that um if the
sw4337B-ms98-a-0050 177.559500 184.026875 government has all the power to decide who's guilty and who's not they wanted to make checks and balances against that
sw4337B-ms98-a-0051 184.026875 189.430000 [silence]
sw4337B-ms98-a-0052 189.430000 191.413125 right exactly
sw4337B-ms98-a-0053 191.413125 194.285250 [silence]
sw4337B-ms98-a-0054 194.285250 195.623875 right
sw4337B-ms98-a-0055 195.623875 198.038750 [silence]
sw4337B-ms98-a-0056 198.038750 201.988875 yeah it's uh does carry an implicit danger with it that way
sw4337B-ms98-a-0057 201.988875 205.865500 [silence]
sw4337B-ms98-a-0058 205.865500 210.510000 right [laughter] that's true too you know how does how does that work
sw4337B-ms98-a-0059 210.510000 211.741875 [silence]
sw4337B-ms98-a-0060 211.741875 213.303750 right [laughter]
sw4337B-ms98-a-0061 213.303750 214.626125 [silence]
sw4337B-ms98-a-0062 214.626125 226.811750 exactly i think it was i think it was more of a danger you know in the seventeen hundreds when um really you know like the King of England could decide who's guilty and who's not guilty i could see how they would
sw4337B-ms98-a-0063 226.811750 235.703875 wanna protect against that so i think the danger is less today would be less of a risk of you know uh corrupt judges and the government forcing
sw4337B-ms98-a-0064 235.703875 236.931625 uh
sw4337B-ms98-a-0065 236.931625 250.481125 you know someone to to be guilty for uh even though they're not or vice versa you know um but it's definitely something that would have to be watched very [laughter-closely] if they decided to do it that way
sw4337B-ms98-a-0066 250.481125 255.550500 [silence]
sw4337B-ms98-a-0067 255.550500 256.807625 exactly
sw4337B-ms98-a-0068 256.807625 257.889625 [silence]
sw4337B-ms98-a-0069 257.889625 259.121000 um-hum

sw4337B-ms98-a-0072 265.780625 268.499750 [silence]
sw4337B-ms98-a-0073 268.499750 275.007250 right and and um you know what what does jury duty mean not not many people really
sw4337B-ms98-a-0074 275.007250 276.269500 uh-huh
sw4337B-ms98-a-0075 276.269500 277.621750 [silence]
sw4337B-ms98-a-0076 277.621750 279.361125 [laughter]
sw4337B-ms98-a-0077 279.361125 281.403250 [silence]
sw4337B-ms98-a-0078 281.403250 286.907250 right that's that's a really interesting issue too and um you know most people
sw4337B-ms98-a-0079 286.907250 292.199500 [vocalized-noise] another interesting thing is you know m[ost]- m[ost]- most people try and get out of jury duty right
sw4337B-ms98-a-0080 292.199500 298.850000 so the people that actually become juries are it's not really just a random sampling of the
