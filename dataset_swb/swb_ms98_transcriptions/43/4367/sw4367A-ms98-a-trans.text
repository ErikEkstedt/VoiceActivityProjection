sw4367A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.281500 [noise] now
sw4367A-ms98-a-0002 1.281500 7.301250 well let's see i see i'm gonna i'm gonna be guilty of not being able to say a whole lot about this i'm not real
sw4367A-ms98-a-0003 7.301250 15.884000 i don't have a budget [laughter] uh what i basically am a do is i- i have a
sw4367A-ms98-a-0004 15.884000 21.166500 a job which which i which makes more money than i need to to work with [laughter]
sw4367A-ms98-a-0005 21.166500 27.284750 and so the money i have left over is pretty much put into investments
sw4367A-ms98-a-0006 27.284750 38.417750 so i'm real guilty of uh of not really doing a whole lot of planning as to how i'm going to set things aside it just it either goes into investment or it goes into things that i want
sw4367A-ms98-a-0007 38.417750 46.817375 [laughter] or it goes or it goes uh goes into the bills you know one or the other i just keep a balance on the checking book and that's it
sw4367A-ms98-a-0008 46.817375 48.192125 [laughter]
sw4367A-ms98-a-0009 48.192125 64.466500 [silence]
sw4367A-ms98-a-0010 64.466500 79.169000 well the one thing i've always done is i've put uh uh on my on my uh from when i started even since since the very beginning i always said that i would put five hundred dollars aside every month

sw4367A-ms98-a-0014 85.610375 91.908000 right oh it it is a budget i mean i certainly consider it to be a budget but i was just under the idea that uh
sw4367A-ms98-a-0015 91.908000 100.920375 i knew i c[ould]- i would be able to do that and that uh y[ou]- you have to be uh responsible for your own
sw4367A-ms98-a-0016 100.920375 115.542375 uh [noise] retirement and welfare and so i said okay this you know i- i can do this so i will do that you know so it early you know when i first started in that you know quite a few years ago i- said i- i know that i will always be able to afford this 
sw4367A-ms98-a-0017 115.542375 118.551125 and i said that well you know if i
sw4367A-ms98-a-0018 118.551125 124.294375 if i start making a significant more amount of money i- i would put more into it
sw4367A-ms98-a-0019 124.294375 126.941875 and make a new budget but i've
sw4367A-ms98-a-0020 126.941875 140.261125 uh it's cost of living has gone up in in with respect to my salary or better [laughter] so i've actually probably making less money than i was when i started [laughter]
sw4367A-ms98-a-0021 140.261125 147.107625 so although i have not ch[anged]- i have not changed that number even though you know cost of living has made it equivalently less
