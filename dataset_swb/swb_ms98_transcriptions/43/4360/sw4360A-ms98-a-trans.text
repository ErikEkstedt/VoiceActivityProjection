sw4360A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.491500 [noise] um
sw4360A-ms98-a-0002 1.491500 2.958875 [silence]
sw4360A-ms98-a-0003 2.958875 5.343875 let's see how about um
sw4360A-ms98-a-0004 5.343875 7.492250 [silence]
sw4360A-ms98-a-0005 7.492250 9.935500 let's see about ten years ago
sw4360A-ms98-a-0006 9.935500 12.183750 um
sw4360A-ms98-a-0007 12.183750 15.481375 what do you think was different ten years ago from now
sw4360A-ms98-a-0008 15.481375 24.564250 [silence]
sw4360A-ms98-a-0009 24.564250 26.046750 um-hum
sw4360A-ms98-a-0010 26.046750 40.473875 [silence]
sw4360A-ms98-a-0011 40.473875 42.048500 uh-huh
sw4360A-ms98-a-0012 42.048500 50.836000 [silence]
sw4360A-ms98-a-0013 50.836000 54.340625 what do you well uh
sw4360A-ms98-a-0014 54.340625 59.708125 actually ten years from today seems rather short
sw4360A-ms98-a-0015 59.708125 60.977625 um
sw4360A-ms98-a-0016 60.977625 62.003750 [silence]
sw4360A-ms98-a-0017 62.003750 65.346625 but i do agree that uh generally it's
sw4360A-ms98-a-0018 65.346625 67.722000 society has sort of
sw4360A-ms98-a-0019 67.722000 69.755000 uh
sw4360A-ms98-a-0020 69.755000 73.338750 let's see rushed everything ahead
sw4360A-ms98-a-0021 73.338750 75.616625 and uh
sw4360A-ms98-a-0022 75.616625 86.285375 i don't know it leaves leaves a lot of time out for family and things like that in other words they just prioritize their lives differently
sw4360A-ms98-a-0023 86.285375 89.933375 but i think that has a lot to do with economic situations
sw4360A-ms98-a-0024 89.933375 95.436875 [silence]
sw4360A-ms98-a-0025 95.436875 96.829250 uh
sw4360A-ms98-a-0026 96.829250 102.191000 [silence]
sw4360A-ms98-a-0027 102.191000 106.100375 hm it depends uh
sw4360A-ms98-a-0028 106.100375 108.694875 it's hard to say because i think
sw4360A-ms98-a-0029 108.694875 112.095500 people were busy ten [laughter-twenty] years ago too 
sw4360A-ms98-a-0030 112.095500 113.855375 um
sw4360A-ms98-a-0031 113.855375 116.617750 [silence]
sw4360A-ms98-a-0032 116.617750 117.902875 i just
sw4360A-ms98-a-0033 117.902875 120.394875 [silence]
sw4360A-ms98-a-0034 120.394875 121.999875 i'm twenty eight
sw4360A-ms98-a-0035 121.999875 123.004500 [silence]
sw4360A-ms98-a-0036 123.004500 124.171625 yeah
sw4360A-ms98-a-0037 124.171625 125.745750 [silence]
sw4360A-ms98-a-0038 125.745750 127.000250 yeah
sw4360A-ms98-a-0039 127.000250 128.082875 [silence]
sw4360A-ms98-a-0040 128.082875 134.096375 i just i think that things were a bit were have been busy all along it's just a matter where priorities are at placed
sw4360A-ms98-a-0041 134.096375 141.975500 and that um usually as far as families are concerned there used to be just one person working and usually the other parent was home
sw4360A-ms98-a-0042 141.975500 151.664875 and now uh it's pretty much an economic necessity of for most in most places for both parents to work
sw4360A-ms98-a-0043 151.664875 159.624375 [silence]
sw4360A-ms98-a-0044 159.624375 162.929375 i think that's part of it too but i do think
sw4360A-ms98-a-0045 162.929375 164.970125 [silence]
sw4360A-ms98-a-0046 164.970125 166.264875 [noise]
sw4360A-ms98-a-0047 166.264875 167.478875 [silence]
sw4360A-ms98-a-0048 167.478875 169.711875 no no i don't
sw4360A-ms98-a-0049 169.711875 174.200250 no i don't think that but then there are a lot of people that that don't have that
sw4360A-ms98-a-0050 174.200250 175.277125 that
sw4360A-ms98-a-0051 175.277125 177.472500 that really do need to work
sw4360A-ms98-a-0052 177.472500 182.055000 i think maybe those people that really do need to work both parents
sw4360A-ms98-a-0053 182.055000 191.875125 just to [noise] survive and then there th[at]- is is that other group that is working to maintain a standard of living that um
sw4360A-ms98-a-0054 191.875125 203.093250 they think is is surviving [laughter] which is really more luxuries um but i i tend to think that
sw4360A-ms98-a-0055 203.093250 212.237375 it's less those people that have the two cars and everything than it is the group that is just trying to survive
sw4360A-ms98-a-0056 212.237375 216.028125 [silence]
sw4360A-ms98-a-0057 216.028125 224.470875 i'm saying that the uh the group that is just trying to survive from day to day where both parents are working
sw4360A-ms98-a-0058 224.470875 230.872375 is more of the majority than the than the people that have the higher standard of living
sw4360A-ms98-a-0059 230.872375 239.649000 because if you look at economics across this country and statistics on who has the money and who
sw4360A-ms98-a-0060 239.649000 242.982125 the uh decreasing um
sw4360A-ms98-a-0061 242.982125 244.005125 [silence]
sw4360A-ms98-a-0062 244.005125 246.461250 middle class in this country
sw4360A-ms98-a-0063 246.461250 250.427750 i think that that's in my opinion the case
sw4360A-ms98-a-0064 250.427750 252.136375 so
sw4360A-ms98-a-0065 252.136375 254.896125 i mean i have met people that
sw4360A-ms98-a-0066 254.896125 257.978125 uh both that [noise]
sw4360A-ms98-a-0067 257.978125 263.458750 that just want to maintain a the standard of living and those that that really need the job
sw4360A-ms98-a-0068 263.458750 264.895250 [silence]
sw4360A-ms98-a-0069 264.895250 266.079750 so
sw4360A-ms98-a-0070 266.079750 274.909750 [silence]
sw4360A-ms98-a-0071 274.909750 276.389375 um-hum
