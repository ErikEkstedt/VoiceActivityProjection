sw4306A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.541375 [noise]
sw4306A-ms98-a-0002 0.541375 3.491250 so what do you think of the current jury system
sw4306A-ms98-a-0003 3.491250 15.928500 [silence]
sw4306A-ms98-a-0004 15.928500 22.614125 yeah def[inite]- definitely you want the benefit of the doubt and as much on the defendant's side as possible
sw4306A-ms98-a-0005 22.614125 25.879625 make sure you're not getting into a police state or anything close to it
sw4306A-ms98-a-0006 25.879625 42.418875 [silence]
sw4306A-ms98-a-0007 42.418875 45.148375 uh it just said trial by jury it didn't say either
sw4306A-ms98-a-0008 45.148375 55.754500 [silence]
sw4306A-ms98-a-0009 55.754500 62.346250 yeah i i think there's a lot more shades of gray that are possible and acceptable in civil trials than in criminal trials
sw4306A-ms98-a-0010 62.346250 66.761750 criminal trials are more of do the facts say that this happened or didn't it happened 
sw4306A-ms98-a-0011 66.761750 75.948375 where in the civil trial there's a more wider range of you know whether this contract was satisfied fully satisfied partly satisfied
sw4306A-ms98-a-0012 75.948375 77.414750 or so on
sw4306A-ms98-a-0013 77.414750 85.121500 [silence]
sw4306A-ms98-a-0014 85.121500 92.172500 so i don't quite like the idea of the in civil trials in sounds like in a lot places the jury comes up with what the award amount should be
sw4306A-ms98-a-0015 92.172500 94.057000 i think you really want
sw4306A-ms98-a-0016 94.057000 100.151750 another party you know the the jury just say this is the things we think money should be awarded for
sw4306A-ms98-a-0017 100.151750 105.559375 and then either the judge or a three judge tribunal coming up with what the award amount should be
sw4306A-ms98-a-0018 105.559375 111.780375 [silence]
sw4306A-ms98-a-0019 111.780375 113.080875 yeah
sw4306A-ms98-a-0020 113.080875 124.222500 [silence]
sw4306A-ms98-a-0021 124.222500 128.789750 right that get overturned or changed on the first appeal
sw4306A-ms98-a-0022 128.789750 136.066000 where as if they came up with a more reasonable one the first time through maybe you wouldn't need to tie up the system with all these appeals
sw4306A-ms98-a-0023 136.066000 160.208625 [silence]
sw4306A-ms98-a-0024 160.208625 162.091000 yeah well th[e]- th[e]- the
sw4306A-ms98-a-0025 162.091000 168.962625 [silence]
sw4306A-ms98-a-0026 168.962625 170.241875 right
sw4306A-ms98-a-0027 170.241875 175.456750 [silence]
sw4306A-ms98-a-0028 175.456750 177.369375 and i also think ye[ah]-
sw4306A-ms98-a-0029 177.369375 185.263750 on the same lines the uh punitive damage awards should really go more towards let's say the government and supporting the court system
sw4306A-ms98-a-0030 185.263750 192.886375 there's no reason an individual person should get the punitive damages i think that's more of
sw4306A-ms98-a-0031 192.886375 196.464875 you know i[t]- it's something that doesn't really
sw4306A-ms98-a-0032 196.464875 201.386875 you know the person is already being compensated for his losses and injuries
sw4306A-ms98-a-0033 201.386875 207.503875 the punitive damages are more of a slap on the wrist of the person doing or the corporation doing the injury
sw4306A-ms98-a-0034 207.503875 212.704125 and having that go to the person who does the suing doesn't quite make sense
sw4306A-ms98-a-0035 212.704125 224.428250 [silence]
sw4306A-ms98-a-0036 224.428250 225.859625 right
sw4306A-ms98-a-0037 225.859625 244.733750 [silence]
sw4306A-ms98-a-0038 244.733750 249.052625 no i think five million dollars would definitely cut into the executive bonuses of GM
sw4306A-ms98-a-0039 249.052625 257.181375 [silence]
sw4306A-ms98-a-0040 257.181375 259.325000 yes yes [laughter]
sw4306A-ms98-a-0041 259.325000 262.896875 and the other thing i guess that was in there was whether the
sw4306A-ms98-a-0042 262.896875 265.624000 [silence]
sw4306A-ms98-a-0043 265.624000 269.522000 you know the other thing i guess on the topic that i'd bring up is um
sw4306A-ms98-a-0044 269.522000 274.571250 the insanity defensives i don't never quite liked that temporary insanity
sw4306A-ms98-a-0045 274.571250 297.281750 [silence]
sw4306A-ms98-a-0046 297.281750 298.530000 right
