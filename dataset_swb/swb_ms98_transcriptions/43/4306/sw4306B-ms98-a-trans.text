sw4306B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.485375 [noise]
sw4306B-ms98-a-0002 0.485375 2.766750 [silence]
sw4306B-ms98-a-0003 2.766750 7.151875 oh i think basically it works okay the uh
sw4306B-ms98-a-0004 7.151875 10.099875 i do think that we need to have
sw4306B-ms98-a-0005 10.099875 15.712750 unanimous verdicts although that can certainly cause problems sometimes
sw4306B-ms98-a-0006 15.712750 22.090000 [silence]
sw4306B-ms98-a-0007 22.090000 23.857375 yeah absolutely
sw4306B-ms98-a-0008 23.857375 25.512750 [silence]
sw4306B-ms98-a-0009 25.512750 27.355750 right absolutely
sw4306B-ms98-a-0010 27.355750 29.096375 [silence]
sw4306B-ms98-a-0011 29.096375 31.863250 the uh i think that
sw4306B-ms98-a-0012 31.863250 36.964500 when they have unanimous verdicts in some civil trials i think that's okay but
sw4306B-ms98-a-0013 36.964500 38.341875 uh
sw4306B-ms98-a-0014 38.341875 42.603875 i'm not sure if they said we're supposed to just talk about civil or criminal or both
sw4306B-ms98-a-0015 42.603875 45.001375 [silence]
sw4306B-ms98-a-0016 45.001375 47.256375 okay well for civil
sw4306B-ms98-a-0017 47.256375 53.836750 i think a i think in a lot of cases in civil trials you can have a i think ten to two 
sw4306B-ms98-a-0018 53.836750 55.619875 is acceptable
sw4306B-ms98-a-0019 55.619875 77.310000 [silence]
sw4306B-ms98-a-0020 77.310000 79.608000 right yeah there's a lot more
sw4306B-ms98-a-0021 79.608000 85.764625 variation there it's not just did they do it or didn't they do it it's
sw4306B-ms98-a-0022 85.764625 105.022250 [silence]
sw4306B-ms98-a-0023 105.022250 112.475750 i agree and i agree that the jury in those kinds of civil trials can even apportion the liability if it's a liability type of thing
sw4306B-ms98-a-0024 112.475750 125.024625 that it's forty percent this guy sixty the other or whatever but uh in civil trials juries have come up with some really ridiculous awards
sw4306B-ms98-a-0025 125.024625 128.359000 [silence]
sw4306B-ms98-a-0026 128.359000 129.684750 right
sw4306B-ms98-a-0027 129.684750 135.690750 [silence]
sw4306B-ms98-a-0028 135.690750 143.470125 right i agree and i think that uh certainly were i in a paralyzed or something i'd want eighty three zillion dollars
sw4306B-ms98-a-0029 143.470125 147.034125 but uh i think rationally
sw4306B-ms98-a-0030 147.034125 157.514000 eighty three million dollars or something is probably acceptive because i think what i'd really want would be someone to you know the money to take care of
sw4306B-ms98-a-0031 157.514000 158.785750 me
sw4306B-ms98-a-0032 158.785750 160.675500 for the rest of my life
sw4306B-ms98-a-0033 160.675500 165.652125 wish that i had proper care and medical treatment but giving me an extra
sw4306B-ms98-a-0034 165.652125 169.879500 million and millions of dollars that i couldn't do a damn thing with anyway
sw4306B-ms98-a-0035 169.879500 177.486875 and uh wouldn't really help anybody except the lawyers who'd get their cut of it their half
sw4306B-ms98-a-0036 177.486875 190.188000 [silence]
sw4306B-ms98-a-0037 190.188000 191.465250 right
sw4306B-ms98-a-0038 191.465250 200.881000 [silence]
sw4306B-ms98-a-0039 200.881000 202.566875 yeah
sw4306B-ms98-a-0040 202.566875 212.125500 [silence]
sw4306B-ms98-a-0041 212.125500 216.141125 right also punitive damages in general i mean if
sw4306B-ms98-a-0042 216.141125 217.530000 there's
sw4306B-ms98-a-0043 217.530000 224.993000 if i'm hurt in a car accident and there's punitive damages of five million dollars against you i'd probably never collect it
sw4306B-ms98-a-0044 224.993000 233.674375 and if it's because your car was bad and it's five million dollars against General Motors that's probably small change to them
sw4306B-ms98-a-0045 233.674375 245.410875 and it's not really punitive against either one because General Motors five million is nothing and to you since it's uncollectable it doesn't make much difference anyway
sw4306B-ms98-a-0046 245.410875 249.081625 [silence]
sw4306B-ms98-a-0047 249.081625 258.342500 uh [laughter] i don't [laughter-know] it's a good question i guess it's off the topic we're supposed to be discussing but
sw4306B-ms98-a-0048 258.342500 260.110875 the uh
sw4306B-ms98-a-0049 260.110875 273.972625 [silence]
sw4306B-ms98-a-0050 273.972625 279.388000 well i like what some states have including Colorado
sw4306B-ms98-a-0051 279.388000 285.757500 and Idaho the wording is something like on the insanity it's
sw4306B-ms98-a-0052 285.757500 290.126250 instead of not guilty because you're insane
sw4306B-ms98-a-0053 290.126250 295.390750 so they send you to the mental hospital it's guilty
sw4306B-ms98-a-0054 295.390750 298.530000 and insane something like
