sw4383A-ms98-a-0034 165.650250 176.928500 you know we we take a lot of the blame for it we have to start voting we have to start talking we have to start uh doing something about it but we're so apathetic it's almost ridiculous
sw4383A-ms98-a-0035 176.928500 187.455125 [silence]

sw4383A-ms98-a-0039 197.920750 203.392375 we have to uh participate in political parties or something uh
sw4383A-ms98-a-0040 203.392375 206.376125 those kinds of things and we don't even do that
sw4383A-ms98-a-0041 206.376125 207.865125 [vocalized-noise]
sw4383A-ms98-a-0042 207.865125 213.001000 [silence]
sw4383A-ms98-a-0043 213.001000 219.882125 oh still i mean we have the right to do it we don't do it that's the whole problem we don't exercise those rights 
sw4383A-ms98-a-0044 219.882125 225.082125 i don't know i think part of the things is maybe a value added tax like what they have in Europe i mean
sw4383A-ms98-a-0045 225.082125 226.657750 um
sw4383A-ms98-a-0046 226.657750 232.096000 that would definitely cut down on the consumerism [vocalized-noise] and which really pushes
sw4383A-ms98-a-0047 232.096000 233.096875 [silence]
sw4383A-ms98-a-0048 233.096875 245.536875 a lot of the uh you know it'd be a good way of getting revenues and all so bring in line towards savings and and putting money into uh instead of spending into investment

sw4383A-ms98-a-0052 257.358250 264.329000 well i don't know i think if people put their minds to it they can do it it's just a matter of mobilizing
sw4383A-ms98-a-0053 264.329000 271.134000 uh you know the people that do it it's a very difficult task i'm not saying that any of this is easy [laughter]
sw4383A-ms98-a-0054 271.134000 275.446000 [silence]

sw4383A-ms98-a-0057 278.039125 289.855750 well think about the wars the nuclear situation and all that talking about the numbers of atomic bombs and how many times you can bomb the world over and how incredible that was and now
sw4383A-ms98-a-0058 289.855750 294.764375 y[ou]- you know that's coming to a point where that's less li[kely]- less and less likely
sw4383A-ms98-a-0059 294.764375 297.762000 right economic ruling brought that down
