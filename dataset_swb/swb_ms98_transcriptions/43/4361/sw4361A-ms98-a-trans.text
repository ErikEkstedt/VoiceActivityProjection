sw4361A-ms98-a-0022 59.282000 60.353000 they are
sw4361A-ms98-a-0023 60.353000 61.448250 [silence]
sw4361A-ms98-a-0024 61.448250 65.732500 oh okay okay because_1 um over here
sw4361A-ms98-a-0025 65.732500 71.118875 um you could pay between four and eight thousand dollars a year
sw4361A-ms98-a-0026 71.118875 73.726125 and um
sw4361A-ms98-a-0027 73.726125 78.350625 [noise] i'd be surprised if we're getting something that was ten times as good as what you're getting
sw4361A-ms98-a-0028 78.350625 81.087500 matter of fact i'll bet it's not as good
sw4361A-ms98-a-0029 81.087500 84.681750 um my feeling is that
sw4361A-ms98-a-0030 84.681750 85.750875 [silence]
sw4361A-ms98-a-0031 85.750875 90.346250 there you know while there are certain problems where
sw4361A-ms98-a-0032 90.346250 101.584000 you know being able to buy a new set of books or a new piece of equipment may be valuable by and large that correlation between the amount of money you shovel in and the quality of education doesn't seem to be that strong
sw4361A-ms98-a-0033 101.584000 109.580750 [silence]
sw4361A-ms98-a-0034 109.580750 113.976125 well again i don't know what it's like on your side of the fence um over here
sw4361A-ms98-a-0035 113.976125 121.670000 um teachers' salaries aren't bad uh they're not executive type salaries although if you're a
sw4361A-ms98-a-0036 121.670000 130.013625 teacher whose been at it for fifteen twenty years uh you can retire [vocalized-noise] when you when you reach the top level it's not bad at all it's quite good
sw4361A-ms98-a-0037 130.013625 131.437625 um
sw4361A-ms98-a-0038 131.437625 133.052750 [silence]
sw4361A-ms98-a-0039 133.052750 134.326625 yeah
sw4361A-ms98-a-0040 134.326625 141.941750 thing is there are nonfinancial there there should be nonfinancial benefits to teaching that i think we've managed to squash out of the system
sw4361A-ms98-a-0041 141.941750 149.985750 um it used to be thirty years ago being a teacher was a uh position of respect you were educating the young
sw4361A-ms98-a-0042 149.985750 154.869000 um now it seems th[at]- you know now the the joke of the year is you know those who can't teach
sw4361A-ms98-a-0043 154.869000 163.277000 and um you know so something went wrong somewhere along the line and i think it's felt both by the people in the educational profession and those outside
sw4361A-ms98-a-0044 163.277000 166.752125 there's a wonderful book by a fellow named Charles Murray
sw4361A-ms98-a-0045 166.752125 169.038375 called In Pursuit of Happiness
sw4361A-ms98-a-0046 169.038375 174.540750 and he discusses what he feels is wrong with the educational system
sw4361A-ms98-a-0047 174.540750 176.761375 and um
sw4361A-ms98-a-0048 176.761375 185.978250 he even offers some suggestions for improvements uh one of the points he makes is he feels that any attempt to fix the problems
sw4361A-ms98-a-0049 185.978250 194.264250 uh whatever the nature of the reform is the administration of the reform will be captured by the union and rendered ineffective 
sw4361A-ms98-a-0050 194.264250 195.291625 [silence]
sw4361A-ms98-a-0051 195.291625 209.020625 in other words if you decide that you're gonna pump another ten percent money in it'll right eventually filter down it filters it's way around to the most firmly entrenched teachers with no regard to their skill level um if you provide other benefits
sw4361A-ms98-a-0052 209.020625 214.387750 they'll eventually work their way around to more firmly entrench the problems not to resolve them
sw4361A-ms98-a-0053 214.387750 217.471625 i'm not sure i agree with him completely but he makes some interesting points
sw4361A-ms98-a-0054 217.471625 223.131000 [silence]
sw4361A-ms98-a-0055 223.131000 224.540875 um-hum
sw4361A-ms98-a-0056 224.540875 225.896500 [noise] yeah
sw4361A-ms98-a-0057 225.896500 231.295625 [silence]
sw4361A-ms98-a-0058 231.295625 238.220125 well it did change the thing to do is find out uh why um because_1 uh
sw4361A-ms98-a-0059 238.220125 248.775375 you know there was a time when the teacher was a respected individual and something changed um and in[trinsically]- intrinsically the ideas you know um training our
sw4361A-ms98-a-0060 248.775375 255.322375 the youth of the country to be uh mature productive responsible citizens is potentially a uh
sw4361A-ms98-a-0061 255.322375 258.461375 a very um what's the right word
sw4361A-ms98-a-0062 258.461375 271.535250 um it's potentially a very re[warding]- not rewarding but uh it should be a respected profession so the question about asking is not why does no [vocalized-noise] why isn't it but well it should be what's preventing it from being respected
sw4361A-ms98-a-0063 271.535250 272.880750 now
sw4361A-ms98-a-0064 272.880750 284.180375 absolutely absolutely i have a wife who substitute teaches and um she brings home some interesting stories uh but the thing that you know i- i hate falling into the trap of back when i was a kid
sw4361A-ms98-a-0065 284.180375 288.898625 uh [laughter-i'm] [laughter-just] [laughter-saying] that but the thing that changed is
sw4361A-ms98-a-0066 288.898625 290.670250 um
sw4361A-ms98-a-0067 290.670250 292.166500 [silence]
sw4361A-ms98-a-0068 292.166500 299.298000 back when i was a kid you know maybe hated the teacher maybe you didn't do your work but you respected or at least feared the t[eacher]-
