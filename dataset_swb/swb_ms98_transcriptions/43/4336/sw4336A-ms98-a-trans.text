sw4336A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 11.559875 [noise] uh well i'm not sure how it is in Georgia but in in Pittsburgh the r[ate]- the crime rate really is not very high at the moment is that is that true for for Atlanta
sw4336A-ms98-a-0002 11.559875 27.496000 [silence]
sw4336A-ms98-a-0003 27.496000 33.136125 yeah i th[at's]- that's probably not true only for Atlanta but for just about anywhere
sw4336A-ms98-a-0004 33.136125 38.360375 [silence]
sw4336A-ms98-a-0005 38.360375 50.096125 well uh fr[om]- least what from what's on the news uh there are very few like actual robberies reported uh uh of of residences what's more likely to occur is uh
sw4336A-ms98-a-0006 50.096125 54.677500 robbery of uh you know knocking over a a small store
sw4336A-ms98-a-0007 54.677500 65.687000 or a car theft you know it things of that nature very few uh you you assaults although on the college campuses uh there are uh
sw4336A-ms98-a-0008 65.687000 79.451500 cases of you know like people getting machine from a from an automated teller and you know somebody trying to to device a scam for for uh getting the money for them that actually preys mostly on foreigners
sw4336A-ms98-a-0009 79.451500 84.035375 but mostly petty things and no[thing]- no[thing]- nothing nothing really too big
sw4336A-ms98-a-0010 84.035375 92.973625 [silence]
sw4336A-ms98-a-0011 92.973625 94.330375 right
sw4336A-ms98-a-0012 94.330375 116.399125 [silence]
sw4336A-ms98-a-0013 116.399125 117.791125 um-hum
sw4336A-ms98-a-0014 117.791125 122.003000 [silence]
sw4336A-ms98-a-0015 122.003000 134.011625 yeah uh a strange case that uh that happened lets about about a year ago was someone actually stole a complete automated teller machine
sw4336A-ms98-a-0016 134.011625 141.314125 it was a freestanding machine and they backed up into it with a truck and put it on the back and drove away with it
sw4336A-ms98-a-0017 141.314125 143.984750 now there's a crime for you [laughter]
sw4336A-ms98-a-0018 143.984750 153.166750 yeah but uh i guess most of the things that happen around here are are pretty uh innocuous although uh from what i hear in the news and and
sw4336A-ms98-a-0019 153.166750 157.769125 i- i s[aw]- saw an episode of the TV show Cops
sw4336A-ms98-a-0020 157.769125 161.278875 uh one time that was in Pittsburgh and uh
sw4336A-ms98-a-0021 161.278875 166.415875 it it it did surprise me because you know they were doing drug arrests and thing and things like that
sw4336A-ms98-a-0022 166.415875 176.971375 but i- i don't really think those things ha[ppen]- happen too often because li[ke]- like i said from what's reported in the news at least it's it's not all that common
sw4336A-ms98-a-0023 176.971375 190.139000 [silence]
sw4336A-ms98-a-0024 190.139000 191.384750 yeah
sw4336A-ms98-a-0025 191.384750 210.593125 [silence]
sw4336A-ms98-a-0026 210.593125 211.829875 yeah
sw4336A-ms98-a-0027 211.829875 221.021750 [silence]
sw4336A-ms98-a-0028 221.021750 230.488375 you know i- i just to diverge a little bit uh i live in an apartment right now i'm finishing out my last semester at the University of Pittsburgh and uh
sw4336A-ms98-a-0029 230.488375 243.390875 the apartment like would be very easy for just about anyone to break in but even so it i mean it's it's still difficult for me to convince my apartment mates to to like lock the doors when they go out [laughter] you know and things like that
sw4336A-ms98-a-0030 243.390875 254.392375 uh i[t]- it would be so easy for someone who is motivated to do so to just you know sit out back take a look at when people are here when they're not just come in
sw4336A-ms98-a-0031 254.392375 267.395250 you know there's a TV and a VCR and they could uh they could get in pretty easy and especially uh since there are bedrooms upstairs and people leave the door open you know while they're upstairs playing music it it could still happen then 
sw4336A-ms98-a-0032 267.395250 298.850000 [silence]
