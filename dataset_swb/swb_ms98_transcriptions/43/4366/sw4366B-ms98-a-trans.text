sw4366B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 3.684000 [noise] well Julie um are you in a situation where you'd
sw4366B-ms98-a-0002 3.684000 6.004375 soon need to deal with uh
sw4366B-ms98-a-0003 6.004375 8.312375 special care for elderly
sw4366B-ms98-a-0004 8.312375 14.705375 [silence]
sw4366B-ms98-a-0005 14.705375 15.789000 um-hum
sw4366B-ms98-a-0006 15.789000 20.316000 [silence]
sw4366B-ms98-a-0007 20.316000 21.418125 hm
sw4366B-ms98-a-0008 21.418125 34.768875 [silence]
sw4366B-ms98-a-0009 34.768875 39.432000 is he able to uh still d[o]- do everything himself pretty well
sw4366B-ms98-a-0010 39.432000 43.654500 [silence]
sw4366B-ms98-a-0011 43.654500 45.209250 oh yeah
sw4366B-ms98-a-0012 45.209250 58.008375 [silence]
sw4366B-ms98-a-0013 58.008375 59.286375 yeah
sw4366B-ms98-a-0014 59.286375 65.898750 [silence]
sw4366B-ms98-a-0015 65.898750 67.179125 um-hum
sw4366B-ms98-a-0016 67.179125 71.711500 [silence]
sw4366B-ms98-a-0017 71.711500 78.764250 yeah and i'm sure that kind of thing would influence your f[ather's]- grandfather's feelings because
sw4366B-ms98-a-0018 78.764250 84.898375 um i th[ink]- you know i think for a lot of people it really is the decision of
sw4366B-ms98-a-0019 84.898375 85.921750 [silence]
sw4366B-ms98-a-0020 85.921750 88.945000 do they still have some of their life left
sw4366B-ms98-a-0021 88.945000 101.008750 and and far as far a[s]- i'm sure a lot of people going into a nursing home is like saying my life is over and i'm just here for the rest of the stay
sw4366B-ms98-a-0022 101.008750 109.136875 and so i you know [noise] i guess most of the time when i think about somebody going into a nursing home
sw4366B-ms98-a-0023 109.136875 110.843500 [silence]
sw4366B-ms98-a-0024 110.843500 124.520375 it's more a case of where they are not able to look after their day-to-day needs ah they can look after a lot of things but there's some of the day-to-day needs that they just are not able to deal with physically anymore
sw4366B-ms98-a-0025 124.520375 125.598000 um
sw4366B-ms98-a-0026 125.598000 127.065250 i know my
sw4366B-ms98-a-0027 127.065250 132.232375 none of my grandparents were in a nursing home they generally
sw4366B-ms98-a-0028 132.232375 137.625125 were able to have someone care for them at home and they died but they were all
sw4366B-ms98-a-0029 137.625125 144.727625 goodness younger than your [laughter-grandparents] like they were in their eighties that type of thing um
sw4366B-ms98-a-0030 144.727625 146.019375 [silence]
sw4366B-ms98-a-0031 146.019375 147.690625 but i did uh
sw4366B-ms98-a-0032 147.690625 149.409750 [silence]
sw4366B-ms98-a-0033 149.409750 157.437625 you know i guess uh when i think nursing home i do think of people that are not able to do s[ome]- take care of themselves physically
sw4366B-ms98-a-0034 157.437625 159.032125 hum
sw4366B-ms98-a-0035 159.032125 164.280375 [silence]
sw4366B-ms98-a-0036 164.280375 169.244250 and that's that's difficult part because i think what they [ofend/often] get
sw4366B-ms98-a-0037 169.244250 172.702125 used as is uh
sw4366B-ms98-a-0038 172.702125 182.436125 [noise] almost like a very high level or long-term care for uh similar to a hospital
sw4366B-ms98-a-0039 182.436125 183.785875 [silence]
sw4366B-ms98-a-0040 183.785875 185.248125 um [noise]
sw4366B-ms98-a-0041 185.248125 189.770375 i know like here in Saskatchewan we have our
sw4366B-ms98-a-0042 189.770375 198.208375 hospital care well and the care actually for the e[lderly]- older people graded in level in four levels
sw4366B-ms98-a-0043 198.208375 202.530000 and a level four type of care would be someone that
sw4366B-ms98-a-0044 202.530000 213.632250 really requires long-term hospital care ah generally are not able to look after [thisselves/themselves] to very to a very great extent physically
sw4366B-ms98-a-0045 213.632250 223.056500 often times they even have mental difficulty with senility or Alzheimer's disease or those [noise] or or physical and mental handicaps
sw4366B-ms98-a-0046 223.056500 225.633375 um you know where they really required
sw4366B-ms98-a-0047 225.633375 231.139875 twenty four hour supervision of some kind even though it may be minimal
sw4366B-ms98-a-0048 231.139875 233.202250 and uh
sw4366B-ms98-a-0049 233.202250 236.009875 but i think [noise] it can be helpful
sw4366B-ms98-a-0050 236.009875 241.638125 in that uh it gets people the level of physical care they need
sw4366B-ms98-a-0051 241.638125 242.658000 [silence]
sw4366B-ms98-a-0052 242.658000 243.525875 um
sw4366B-ms98-a-0053 243.525875 254.202875 [silence]
sw4366B-ms98-a-0054 254.202875 260.224625 yeah i thi[nk]- and i think it happens more in areas where it's uh
sw4366B-ms98-a-0055 260.224625 262.268125 i guess uh
sw4366B-ms98-a-0056 262.268125 263.341875 [silence]
sw4366B-ms98-a-0057 263.341875 267.635375 a broad social medical system where uh
sw4366B-ms98-a-0058 267.635375 274.602250 you know there's government medical care and that kind of thing if it it's the lot where it's funded by the individuals 
sw4366B-ms98-a-0059 274.602250 275.837375 [silence]
sw4366B-ms98-a-0060 275.837375 288.124250 and and i guess that's sort of my lack of understanding i think that a majority of the places in the US um you know there is some government aid available but the majority of it is
sw4366B-ms98-a-0061 288.124250 290.854250 to the ability of the individual to pay
sw4366B-ms98-a-0062 290.854250 291.961750 [silence]
sw4366B-ms98-a-0063 291.961750 298.722000 and uh if you're not able to look after yourself then you have to rely o[n]-
