sw4309A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 2.506625 [noise] why what would you tell someone
sw4309A-ms98-a-0002 2.506625 13.325000 [silence]
sw4309A-ms98-a-0003 13.325000 14.626500 [vocalized-noise]

sw4309A-ms98-a-0006 19.057000 25.643125 [silence]
sw4309A-ms98-a-0007 25.643125 26.959375 uh-huh
sw4309A-ms98-a-0008 26.959375 32.770875 [silence]
sw4309A-ms98-a-0009 32.770875 34.135250 uh-huh
sw4309A-ms98-a-0010 34.135250 41.126000 [silence]
sw4309A-ms98-a-0011 41.126000 42.373000 um-hum
sw4309A-ms98-a-0012 42.373000 50.666250 [silence]
sw4309A-ms98-a-0013 50.666250 52.069750 um-hum
sw4309A-ms98-a-0014 52.069750 64.255875 [silence]
sw4309A-ms98-a-0015 64.255875 76.815125 well i guess i would agree somewhat i mean in terms of finding out first why they want to go to college if they do want to go to college a lot of times it's the parents who want them to go to college rather than themselves
sw4309A-ms98-a-0016 76.815125 84.436875 um but uh i think it's probably the the studies have been done looking at uh
sw4309A-ms98-a-0017 84.436875 93.362500 how well you are and what you do when you end up whether or not you uh have a degree or not uh makes a big difference later on in your life
sw4309A-ms98-a-0018 93.362500 101.671375 and um [vocalized-noise] you know it'd be good to even to start as early as possible to understand what what you child would desire
sw4309A-ms98-a-0019 101.671375 108.032875 and and determine a goal some point uh before like the last moment [laughter]
sw4309A-ms98-a-0020 108.032875 114.166250 and but you know you never know they always a lot of people go to college because they don't know what else is better to do
sw4309A-ms98-a-0021 114.166250 116.978125 it seems like it's my experience
sw4309A-ms98-a-0022 116.978125 122.777625 but uh i guess that once they've decided they wanted to go to college
sw4309A-ms98-a-0023 122.777625 127.576375 i think that's that's also that's something [vocalized-noise] uh important but uh
sw4309A-ms98-a-0024 127.576375 133.287375 you know have them go through the i guess they have like the Barron's books and various other books that describes
sw4309A-ms98-a-0025 133.287375 139.233500 all the different colleges that they are in terms of competitiveness and things like that
sw4309A-ms98-a-0026 139.233500 143.754625 and they could also narrow it down that way other than just the economic things
sw4309A-ms98-a-0027 143.754625 146.604125 though it's probably more so now than used to be
sw4309A-ms98-a-0028 146.604125 151.487250 um but people you know you want to try to match their needs as best they can and then if
sw4309A-ms98-a-0029 151.487250 164.062125 you know you could always shoot for those places that don't ha[ve]- you know are [vocalized-noise] that might be considered out of your range but sometimes you might be able to get a scholarship or whatever have you so i wouldn't rule them out on the first cut
sw4309A-ms98-a-0030 164.062125 169.337250 uh i would try to get them to to find the colleges they think that are
sw4309A-ms98-a-0031 169.337250 178.823875 you know best fit their needs in terms of the size the college the kinds of course offerings the reputation they have in those areas
sw4309A-ms98-a-0032 178.823875 188.992500 um you know whether a child wants to be closer or away how far away they want to be from home there's a lot of different other aspects to it you know
sw4309A-ms98-a-0033 188.992500 190.229500 [silence]
sw4309A-ms98-a-0034 190.229500 199.408000 yeah and uh i think there's things like student uh faculty ratios and and uh
sw4309A-ms98-a-0035 199.408000 206.888500 all that kind of stuff how well endowed the school is sometimes you that's important because if it's not well endowed school
sw4309A-ms98-a-0036 206.888500 215.014250 uh then a you know a lot of times they're just they uh the schools go from year to year based on just the enrollment 
sw4309A-ms98-a-0037 215.014250 224.708375 and uh if that's what the school's doing then um it may not be around the following year especially these times 
sw4309A-ms98-a-0038 224.708375 230.631750 you know they're not as economically sound [laughter] right
sw4309A-ms98-a-0039 230.631750 235.382875 [silence]
sw4309A-ms98-a-0040 235.382875 236.904875 um-hum

sw4309A-ms98-a-0046 273.200875 275.455625 oh yeah uh-huh
sw4309A-ms98-a-0047 275.455625 280.540750 yeah they also tend not to be as well endowed and they also have 
sw4309A-ms98-a-0048 280.540750 287.286625 lots of other uh good and bad points sometimes the offerings that they have is better than
sw4309A-ms98-a-0049 287.286625 291.793000 you know some of the Ivy schools that's for sure uh
sw4309A-ms98-a-0050 291.793000 294.222250 but there's also other [laughter-problems] too 
sw4309A-ms98-a-0051 294.222250 299.522000 um you know they tend to they all admit all sorts of people
