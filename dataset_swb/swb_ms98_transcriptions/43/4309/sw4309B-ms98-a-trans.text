sw4309B-ms98-a-0005 4.115250 12.445375 well i think first thing is they need to talk with their child to [vocalized-noise] their child talk to their child and find exactly what they want
sw4309B-ms98-a-0006 12.445375 18.279375 to do why are they're going why are they going to college instead of doing something else
sw4309B-ms98-a-0007 18.279375 22.870125 once you find out why they want to go to college then you can get a better idea of
sw4309B-ms98-a-0008 22.870125 26.361125 uh what range of colleges they should go to
sw4309B-ms98-a-0009 26.361125 33.666125 uh obviously if they want to learn trade skills you wouldn't send them to an academic center and vice versa
sw4309B-ms98-a-0010 33.666125 44.478875 and um beyond that i think you need to consider the uh range of expenses of going to college that would probably narrow your ranges down even further
sw4309B-ms98-a-0011 44.478875 51.731625 and if you want to go something beyond what you can afford then you need to start investigating scholarship and other things
sw4309B-ms98-a-0012 51.731625 63.336875 so i think you start out with something broad like that and then narrow your range as you you know as you find out more about the child and what the their uh needs are and what they want to do
sw4309B-ms98-a-0013 63.336875 65.049500 how about you

sw4309B-ms98-a-0034 229.059250 232.780750 well i have a a daughter now who is
sw4309B-ms98-a-0035 232.780750 237.091250 a junior [vocalized-noise] who is looking at colleges and uh
sw4309B-ms98-a-0036 237.091250 242.603750 it's interesting uh there were a lot more choices years ago when i went to college
sw4309B-ms98-a-0037 242.603750 245.178375 and uh [vocalized-noise]
sw4309B-ms98-a-0038 245.178375 253.443750 she is is going through the process much like what you're you know you've described and i've des[cribed]- described so
sw4309B-ms98-a-0039 253.443750 260.019875 how far away do they want to go what do they want to do how important is whether it's a private or a public school
sw4309B-ms98-a-0040 260.019875 263.121375 what are the chances for scholarships
sw4309B-ms98-a-0041 263.121375 267.488375 and uh a lot of mid range smaller schools that
sw4309B-ms98-a-0042 267.488375 273.996000 are actually easier to get into if you have pretty good grades of course it's not quite so comparative to say the Ivy League schools
