sw4307B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.981125 [noise] drug testing hey
sw4307B-ms98-a-0002 1.981125 46.405875 [silence]
sw4307B-ms98-a-0003 46.405875 56.959500 i'm a little bit more uh against it than that because i see this as an absolute parallel to the McCarthy witch hunts when anybody who held
sw4307B-ms98-a-0004 56.959500 63.083750 liberal opinions or supported civil rights was considered an evil satanic agent of Moscow
sw4307B-ms98-a-0005 63.083750 67.625875 quite often i m[ean]- there's the legitimate concern of people who are too stupid 
sw4307B-ms98-a-0006 67.625875 72.201375 not to use chemicals that im[pair]- can impair their behavior in a job 
sw4307B-ms98-a-0007 72.201375 78.366125 where they better be on top of things like running trains flying planes or uh driving buses 
sw4307B-ms98-a-0008 78.366125 90.489125 and also uh the uh strictures against driving uh uni[mpaired]- while impaired should apply to any chemical of any kind whether the government has authorized the use of that chemical or not 
sw4307B-ms98-a-0009 90.489125 111.035625 [silence]
sw4307B-ms98-a-0010 111.035625 117.621250 and they take your license on the assumption that you're guilty which makes sense but this is not the issue here
sw4307B-ms98-a-0011 117.621250 129.155000 it's not the issue in question though because what the government is trying to do is to truly impose thought control they are saying there are things you cannot do to your mind and body because we have not authorized to do it
sw4307B-ms98-a-0012 129.155000 131.427375 and further more if we think that you are
sw4307B-ms98-a-0013 131.427375 138.537875 uh we're going to make sure that you can't get a job or that you'll be fired from your job if you are engaging in this behavior
sw4307B-ms98-a-0014 138.537875 149.257375 now blood tests aren't really being called for what they're doing is calling for piss tests which technically it's leaving your body but whatever it is they shouldn't even have the right to ask
sw4307B-ms98-a-0015 149.257375 155.123000 they shouldn't have the right to prohibit these chemicals what they should have the right to prohibit is misuse of anything
sw4307B-ms98-a-0016 155.123000 162.086375 [silence]
sw4307B-ms98-a-0017 162.086375 170.268875 yeah i think that it's just a witch hunt and that the people being hit the hardest are the ones that cause the least impact something like eighty percent
sw4307B-ms98-a-0018 170.268875 184.942625 of the tests and the positive tests and the arrests contain concern marijuana the only commonly used drug that has no traceable deaths from overuse none even aspirin kills thirty two people a year
sw4307B-ms98-a-0019 184.942625 198.120625 and if by all standards that can be compared potential for abuse uh general impact on society physical impact on the individual this drug should not be outlawed but the right wing does not want to hear talk like that
sw4307B-ms98-a-0020 198.120625 205.634875 and so on top of that goes the whole Republican drug testing uh intervention and control of your body attitude
sw4307B-ms98-a-0021 205.634875 218.981125 an interesting side note of this is the Motorola company lost eighteen months of development on the oh four oh chip because they instituted drug testing and the entire development team for that chip left the company
sw4307B-ms98-a-0022 218.981125 220.470500 [silence]
sw4307B-ms98-a-0023 220.470500 227.073500 and that's why it took this long for the oh four oh to get out they scuttled their own boat and cost themselves millions of dollars for that
sw4307B-ms98-a-0024 227.073500 241.492125 [silence]
sw4307B-ms98-a-0025 241.492125 251.067125 i'd say it's pretty much it's uh right to privacy the individual can do whatever they want as long as they don't negatively impact other individuals it is then that negative impact that should be looked at
sw4307B-ms98-a-0026 251.067125 257.588625 not the uh not the direct cause of it it's under those grounds that we don't have alcohol prohibition or tobacco prohibition
sw4307B-ms98-a-0027 257.588625 270.330875 [silence]
sw4307B-ms98-a-0028 270.330875 273.265000 yeah that's true too especially with tobacco
sw4307B-ms98-a-0029 273.265000 279.291250 and alcohol they did try to ban it they failed utterly they failed miserably and led to the creation of the modern day mafia
sw4307B-ms98-a-0030 279.291250 285.337000 and that's pretty much what's happ[en]- that's pretty much what's happened with other with the the current prohibition
sw4307B-ms98-a-0031 285.337000 290.219125 [silence]
sw4307B-ms98-a-0032 290.219125 292.942875 to tell yeah that we [laughter-are] getting a stray
sw4307B-ms98-a-0033 292.942875 298.850000 [silence]
