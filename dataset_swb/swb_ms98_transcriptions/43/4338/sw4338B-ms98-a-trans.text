sw4338B-ms98-a-0002 1.009125 2.650875 [silence]
sw4338B-ms98-a-0003 2.650875 15.157375 well we we do of sorts it's not a it's not a family budget both my my husband and i work and what we do is basically treat each income as separate uh
sw4338B-ms98-a-0004 15.157375 24.889625 partly we didn't want to fall into the trap of arguing over the family money oh yeah well you know i earned this much and therefore i have the right to spend that
sw4338B-ms98-a-0005 24.889625 31.033625 and well you know you overspent the the total budget this way each of us knows what's in our own bank accounts
sw4338B-ms98-a-0006 31.033625 38.852500 so you can if you want to write a check for somebody's birthday present you don't have to worry about the other person seeing it that sort of thing
sw4338B-ms98-a-0007 38.852500 50.800375 but uh what's unique is that uh my husband keeps a spreadsheet of uh the income and he submits a bill to me every month an itemized bill and i pay that
sw4338B-ms98-a-0008 50.800375 65.341875 and then so he has track of both of our expenses i pay part of the utilities he pays part of the utilities it takes a little bit more work but it does work for us i mean i[t]- it really does work very successfully for us
sw4338B-ms98-a-0009 65.341875 66.419625 [silence]
sw4338B-ms98-a-0010 66.419625 69.961000 yes i'm [laughter-i] am juggling one right now on my lap
sw4338B-ms98-a-0011 69.961000 83.989000 uh we have a uh almost one he he'll be one on on April second you can hear him and the one is four and he's off taking a bath [laughter] so uh yeah we've got two kids and uh
sw4338B-ms98-a-0012 83.989000 86.350500 uh well what
sw4338B-ms98-a-0013 86.350500 87.369750 [silence]
sw4338B-ms98-a-0014 87.369750 96.619500 well in terms of of immediate expenses like clothing um i purchase those out of my income and i get reimbursed
sw4338B-ms98-a-0015 96.619500 106.717875 fifty percent of that by my husband so again i submit bills to him [laughter] receipts to him uh for the day care uh what we do is actually take that directly out of my income
sw4338B-ms98-a-0016 106.717875 117.420750 um and my my company has a uh a pretax medical deduction uh medical and uh child care uh all together so
sw4338B-ms98-a-0017 117.420750 120.633125 um that that helps f[or]- for that planning
sw4338B-ms98-a-0018 120.633125 122.115250 [silence]
sw4338B-ms98-a-0019 122.115250 127.285875 excuse me no no no a a biotech company as a [laughter-matter] of fact
sw4338B-ms98-a-0020 127.285875 128.358500 [silence]
sw4338B-ms98-a-0021 128.358500 135.387750 yeah and it it works out it works out really well now in terms of long term like college expenses
sw4338B-ms98-a-0022 135.387750 146.238125 uh right now we don't have something that's set up that's labeled college we have uh more along the lines of um uh sort of investment plans in each of the children's names
sw4338B-ms98-a-0023 146.238125 157.810000 and they were set up as as first birthday presents or or or even newborn presents from the grandparents just you know the the actually assembled and set up 
sw4338B-ms98-a-0024 157.810000 161.512750 uh all the investment decisions are are now ours
sw4338B-ms98-a-0025 161.512750 169.992500 but in terms of retirement that's the one area that that is is still a little sticky because yo[u]- yo[u]- you sort of have your retirement plans through your companies
sw4338B-ms98-a-0026 169.992500 176.083250 and we spent so much time trying to to make sure that the boys are okay [laughter] that
sw4338B-ms98-a-0027 176.083250 186.271625 an[d]- you know for our own retirement there's not a whole lot actually organized but we do have uh the things through our companies so that's that's a start anyway
sw4338B-ms98-a-0028 186.271625 192.892250 [silence]
sw4338B-ms98-a-0029 192.892250 194.276000 um-hum
sw4338B-ms98-a-0030 194.276000 198.188750 [noise]
sw4338B-ms98-a-0031 198.188750 206.689125 [silence]
sw4338B-ms98-a-0032 206.689125 208.265625 um
sw4338B-ms98-a-0033 208.265625 214.795250 [silence]
sw4338B-ms98-a-0034 214.795250 216.535625 [noise]
sw4338B-ms98-a-0035 216.535625 227.954375 [silence]
sw4338B-ms98-a-0036 227.954375 229.235125 um
sw4338B-ms98-a-0037 229.235125 235.396875 [silence]
sw4338B-ms98-a-0038 235.396875 236.770000 yeah
sw4338B-ms98-a-0039 236.770000 248.070250 well it's not it's not actually too bad once you get the s[preadsheet]- the spreadsheet set out by my husband has categories for things like utilities uh you know other expenses
sw4338B-ms98-a-0040 248.070250 253.619375 uh the rent and my contribution i don't make as much financially as he does
sw4338B-ms98-a-0041 253.619375 265.093375 so my contribution is prorated it doesn't come it doesn't come fifty percent out of my pocket when i don't make fifty percent of the income uh you know which is nice it's fair
sw4338B-ms98-a-0042 265.093375 273.336500 uh so actually what it what happens is that we gather all the bills and then write them down and then uh
sw4338B-ms98-a-0043 273.336500 284.814750 w[ell]- uh after that it's just a question of putting them into the computer and the computer generates you know i mean it it takes the percentage that's necessary and he prints out a bill and i write a check and that's it
sw4338B-ms98-a-0044 284.814750 288.524000 um once it's set up it works it works reasonable well
sw4338B-ms98-a-0045 288.524000 300.226000 so i[t]- it most of my friends though when they find out about it the[y]- the[y]- they think your husband submits a bill to you that's that's that's weird [laughter] that's really weird but we don't i mean i
