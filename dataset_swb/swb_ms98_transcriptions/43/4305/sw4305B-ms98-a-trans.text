sw4305B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.361875 [noise]
sw4305B-ms98-a-0002 0.361875 10.563375 i work for one of the defense contractors out here [laughter] actually it's it's not a defense contractor it's uh a federally funded research and development center 
sw4305B-ms98-a-0003 10.563375 17.423625 [laughter] kind of like the Mitre Corporation only uh uh we work mainly with the Air Force in terms of satellites 
sw4305B-ms98-a-0004 17.423625 23.225500 [silence]
sw4305B-ms98-a-0005 23.225500 26.388500 th[e]- the government yes uh
sw4305B-ms98-a-0006 26.388500 30.052125 [silence]
sw4305B-ms98-a-0007 30.052125 31.458750 that's correct
sw4305B-ms98-a-0008 31.458750 34.752250 [silence]
sw4305B-ms98-a-0009 34.752250 45.343125 uh actually no um it turns out that uh we are a non profit organization so the the benefits are different um
sw4305B-ms98-a-0010 45.343125 53.585875 i mean basically you get you know the the health care coverage uh one of the big pluses for this company was you would get um
sw4305B-ms98-a-0011 53.585875 65.692750 three weeks of vacation to start normally in California when you work for one of the defense contractors they give you three weeks to start but all of the companies shut down between Christmas and New Year's so you end up
sw4305B-ms98-a-0012 65.692750 72.844875 in essence only getting two weeks of voluntary vacation and one week of involuntary vacation is you want to look at it that way
sw4305B-ms98-a-0013 72.844875 81.003875 uh where as in our uh for our company they did not have until very recently a plant shutdown between Christmas and New Year's
sw4305B-ms98-a-0014 81.003875 85.496625 uh the idea is that you've got the three weeks and you can take it whenever you want it
sw4305B-ms98-a-0015 85.496625 89.231875 so that was a big plus benefit for this company
sw4305B-ms98-a-0016 89.231875 90.641625 [silence]
sw4305B-ms98-a-0017 90.641625 104.654500 uh well the past couple of years because of uh cut backs and and whatnot they uh basically have put down and told people that you either take a week of vacation between Christmas and New Year's or take a week of no pay
sw4305B-ms98-a-0018 104.654500 116.397250 uh the it's up to you you have the choice and so the the company does shut down between Christmas and New Year's i don't believe that this is a long term
sw4305B-ms98-a-0019 116.397250 123.964250 solution that they're going to use but uh they have been doing it for the past couple of years and they may do it for a year or two more
sw4305B-ms98-a-0020 123.964250 127.252375 [silence]
sw4305B-ms98-a-0021 127.252375 128.671000 uh
sw4305B-ms98-a-0022 128.671000 132.947750 uh-huh no i don't think any of unless of course you go with an HMO
sw4305B-ms98-a-0023 132.947750 147.460750 uh the thing is that they also do not have uh eye glass coverage so if you need eye glasses you're on your own uh they also do not provide uh well they do provide dental if you go with an HMO though you lose the
sw4305B-ms98-a-0024 147.460750 156.789875 um the choose choice of doctors if you take their you know they have one of these cafeteria plans so you you either choose the HMO or you choose the
sw4305B-ms98-a-0025 156.789875 168.159125 um i guess blue cross and blue shield is who they have now and the idea there is that if you go with one of their associated doctors they'll pay eighty percent if you go with a non associated doctor they pay seventy percent
sw4305B-ms98-a-0026 168.159125 175.973875 so that that [noise] i have to admit i mean when i first started out you were covered completely and it was not a um
sw4305B-ms98-a-0027 175.973875 185.709750 an HMO type of thing i i when i first started out in engineering i worked for RCA back in the mid seventies and uh they just covered everything
sw4305B-ms98-a-0028 185.709750 201.571250 but uh you know i've watched this slowly erode erode erode until the point where now um i figure that the next thing is going to be uh you're going to have to pay big bucks and they're only going to pay cover certain certain uh diseases
sw4305B-ms98-a-0029 201.571250 205.516375 [silence]
