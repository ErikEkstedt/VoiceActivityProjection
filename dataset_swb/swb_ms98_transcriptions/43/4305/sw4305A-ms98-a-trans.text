sw4305A-ms98-a-0038 201.397625 208.180625 well that's it certainly looks the way things are headed right now if uh something isn't done at the i guess at the federal level or
sw4305A-ms98-a-0039 208.180625 217.253750 or something i don't know about this but it's uh i um worked for a number of years as support staff in law law firms in the Washington Area
sw4305A-ms98-a-0040 217.253750 229.040375 and i kind of had exactly the same experience uh l[aw]- the especially during the seventies and eighties law firms were just rolling in the money
sw4305A-ms98-a-0041 229.040375 237.172875 and uh it's a little bit less that way now the recession has even hurt a lot of the big law firms in this area but um
sw4305A-ms98-a-0042 237.172875 248.365625 the result uh was during that period that not only did we get one hundred percent benefits in terms of health care and so forth but they were rather extravagant plans that we were
sw4305A-ms98-a-0043 248.365625 251.193375 party to with with uh full dental and
sw4305A-ms98-a-0044 251.193375 263.295625 uh you know optical s[tuff]- stuff for our eyes and uh and so forth and i have to confess i had a couple of real bad health scares during that time and found that it really came in handy the HMO idea
sw4305A-ms98-a-0045 263.295625 269.871000 appeared on the scene i guess in the mid eighties and i tried a couple of them out
sw4305A-ms98-a-0046 269.871000 281.044250 uh and in fact have eventually settled on one of them i've change jobs now but this the same HMO is still available in my current position and and um
sw4305A-ms98-a-0047 281.044250 291.957500 it's it's uh i the interesting thing they've done some interesting things with the HMO's in this area where you there are a number of doctors and you can choose amongst the doctors that are available in fact uh
sw4305A-ms98-a-0048 291.957500 298.402000 one of them that's run by Prudential has essentially signed up a bunch of private physicians in the the Washington Area
