sw4345B-ms98-a-0045 214.470250 220.702250 one of the things that i found interesting last year during the uh the Gulf conflict
sw4345B-ms98-a-0046 220.702250 227.349750 was a sentiment against uh Peter Arnett who had stayed in Iraq and was
sw4345B-ms98-a-0047 227.349750 233.941125 presenting uh some of the things that were available uh there was a
sw4345B-ms98-a-0048 233.941125 238.039625 there was uh a piece where he was showing a bombed out
sw4345B-ms98-a-0049 238.039625 250.766750 building where there was obviously a crudely uh a hastily erected sign saying baby milk factory and while he was
sw4345B-ms98-a-0050 250.766750 263.873625 being severely uh censored and could not make any judgment call on this it was fairly obvious that it was a piece of propaganda but people were really down on him
sw4345B-ms98-a-0051 263.873625 276.155500 for reporting the fact that thi[s]- you know this isn't a baby milk factory how could he say it was uh and i think that that to me showed that the Americans were really getting used to having
sw4345B-ms98-a-0052 276.155500 283.589500 the not just the facts but also the conclusions and opinions spoon fed to them
