sw4345A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.534250 [noise]
sw4345A-ms98-a-0002 0.534250 32.344625 [silence]
sw4345A-ms98-a-0003 32.344625 38.731375 no we don't have the uh national public radio in in my area i can hear it at the um
sw4345A-ms98-a-0004 38.731375 46.947875 uh oh the college town nearby when i'm in Stillwater which is about an hour away but the FM signal doesn't reach this far
sw4345A-ms98-a-0005 46.947875 58.471625 uh i listen to shortwave quite a bit it gives you a whole different perspective on the news uh when you hear it from say a European point of view or from the country of origin
sw4345A-ms98-a-0006 58.471625 61.575625 uh i agree with you too on the um
sw4345A-ms98-a-0007 61.575625 65.913125 uh the cable channel CNN and Headline News
sw4345A-ms98-a-0008 65.913125 75.421500 um i'm not too satisfied with our local newspaper uh which is why i rely on shortwave and and then the cable CNN
sw4345A-ms98-a-0009 75.421500 96.628750 [silence]
sw4345A-ms98-a-0010 96.628750 106.678750 i think a lot of it is just um the fact that in the US you're so far removed uh in a lot of cases from say conflicts or
sw4345A-ms98-a-0011 106.678750 111.145250 or it's not happening in your backyard so it's it's more of a
sw4345A-ms98-a-0012 111.145250 121.133500 it's not as a personal uh the news isn't as personal in what we receive domestically than than what's on the shortwave it's BBC is um
sw4345A-ms98-a-0013 121.133500 125.642500 oh i don't know the right word is is almost um
sw4345A-ms98-a-0014 125.642500 129.689875 they almost take all emotions out of it when they report it
sw4345A-ms98-a-0015 129.689875 133.929875 and it just they seem to give more just the facts than opinions 
sw4345A-ms98-a-0016 133.929875 143.542875 [silence]
sw4345A-ms98-a-0017 143.542875 148.208875 uh very much so very much so and i- i think a lot of it is um
sw4345A-ms98-a-0018 148.208875 150.604000 especially TV news
sw4345A-ms98-a-0019 150.604000 157.685375 they don't really have the time and a lot of them_1 don't have the education and the background to um
sw4345A-ms98-a-0020 157.685375 169.102000 oh to really decipher the news and to really explain it i mean i you know i think it's important to interpret it but a lot of times the person doesn't have the experience to to do the interpreting
sw4345A-ms98-a-0021 169.102000 183.329625 [silence]
sw4345A-ms98-a-0022 183.329625 192.432875 oh i like the straight reporting um and then i- i hope to be able to form my own opinion of it it's it's nice to hear someone's interpretation of it
sw4345A-ms98-a-0023 192.432875 204.034875 um i always think it's humorous when when the President gives the State of the Union and uh for thirty minutes and then for an hour and a half you hear different commentators explaining what you just heard
sw4345A-ms98-a-0024 204.034875 207.989125 and a lot of times i don't hear [laughter-exactly] what they what they write into it
sw4345A-ms98-a-0025 207.989125 209.140875 [silence]
sw4345A-ms98-a-0026 209.140875 213.503250 so i overall i think i would rather hear just straight reporting
sw4345A-ms98-a-0027 213.503250 283.588125 [silence]
sw4345A-ms98-a-0028 283.588125 296.338750 yeah i- i think people are people have that opinion they they wanna sit down in front of the TV and um or at a read a magazine or USA Today and read in four paragraphs
sw4345A-ms98-a-0029 296.338750 298.690000 uh and and find out every
