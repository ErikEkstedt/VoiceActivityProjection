sw4379B-ms98-a-0002 0.350375 2.522250 uh-huh do you
sw4379B-ms98-a-0003 2.522250 6.558250 [silence]
sw4379B-ms98-a-0004 6.558250 11.343500 we have a very detailed budget because my husband is a finance major
sw4379B-ms98-a-0005 11.343500 14.197375 and we have
sw4379B-ms98-a-0006 14.197375 21.437875 you know we have money that we take out each month that we um you know for food and and for
sw4379B-ms98-a-0007 21.437875 30.025000 for gas and things like that and then we put aside so much money each month for birthdays and for Christmas and for um other things
sw4379B-ms98-a-0008 30.025000 39.305375 then we take our major purchases we want to make during that year and we budget them into what we call our n[eeds]- our needs and wants list
sw4379B-ms98-a-0009 39.305375 48.293500 and so um the things that like a vacation we have a vacation fund we have a fund for the things we need and then a for the things that we want
sw4379B-ms98-a-0010 48.293500 58.184625 and um and we're continually putting into those you know each month how much we're going to need and then we know the month that we're going to have enough to get that particular item
sw4379B-ms98-a-0011 58.184625 63.201500 so we very rarely buy anything on credit everything we buy is paid for
sw4379B-ms98-a-0012 63.201500 66.284375 [laughter]
sw4379B-ms98-a-0013 66.284375 83.929250 [silence]
sw4379B-ms98-a-0014 83.929250 85.220000 right
sw4379B-ms98-a-0015 85.220000 86.750125 right
sw4379B-ms98-a-0016 86.750125 100.514000 [silence]
sw4379B-ms98-a-0017 100.514000 101.784625 right
sw4379B-ms98-a-0018 101.784625 110.141875 um we have found that we spend less money if we pull out the money um instead of just writing checks for things
sw4379B-ms98-a-0019 110.141875 114.505125 if we actually pull it out and keep it in a safe here
sw4379B-ms98-a-0020 114.505125 123.503625 and we actually pull out the money each month that we want to put in for birthdays that we want to put in for um the vacation that we put in for Christmas
sw4379B-ms98-a-0021 123.503625 125.958000 [silence]
sw4379B-ms98-a-0022 125.958000 134.247625 [vocalized-noise] well a lot of that um i don't know how safe it is i guess um we keep it all in a safe here at the house
sw4379B-ms98-a-0023 134.247625 141.478500 and so it's actually pulled out then we keep our we have a savings account for the [kidzees/kids] education that money goes into there
sw4379B-ms98-a-0024 141.478500 145.120000 each of our ch[ildren]- we have three children so they each have their own account
sw4379B-ms98-a-0025 145.120000 147.561500 that money is put into each month
sw4379B-ms98-a-0026 147.561500 153.958750 [silence]
sw4379B-ms98-a-0027 153.958750 155.575000 he does somewhat
sw4379B-ms98-a-0028 155.575000 157.301375 yeah he does somewhat
sw4379B-ms98-a-0029 157.301375 161.453000 um we have an investment plan yeah i guess he does
sw4379B-ms98-a-0030 161.453000 167.946250 but um we have really found this is the first year we've done it this way and we are really saving a lot of money
sw4379B-ms98-a-0031 167.946250 176.364000 [silence]
sw4379B-ms98-a-0032 176.364000 187.830500 Christmas birthdays uh car maintenance dental medical we just averaged out how much last year we used per month on medical and how much we used on dental and um
sw4379B-ms98-a-0033 187.830500 195.645375 and so now when we have to come up with that deductible that our insurance doesn't cover rather than wondering where it's going to come from
sw4379B-ms98-a-0034 195.645375 196.743750 we have it
sw4379B-ms98-a-0035 196.743750 206.395250 you know and when when we see something on sale um instead of just looking in our checking account and saying well we've got enough and getting it and then when something comes up you know kind of scrimping to pay for a medical bill
sw4379B-ms98-a-0036 206.395250 210.956250 everything's taken care of and we're finding that we even have more money than we thought
sw4379B-ms98-a-0037 210.956250 213.017125 yeah [laughter]
sw4379B-ms98-a-0038 213.017125 218.732375 [silence]

sw4379B-ms98-a-0043 227.522625 238.361750 [noise] i have a set amount it's very generous and i usually have extra and so then that can go um you know either back into our checking account or i can just carry it over
sw4379B-ms98-a-0044 238.361750 249.431625 um you know there are certain months of the year that you'll spend more on food than other months and certain times when that will be left over but that's completely up to me how i do that and then um because i don't work i stay home
sw4379B-ms98-a-0045 249.431625 256.877875 and so it's kind of my money and i also get my own money to do what i want to go to lunches you know and do that kind of thing

sw4379B-ms98-a-0050 295.436250 300.386000 [noise] and if we find one on sale before then then we can just take that and put it towards the
