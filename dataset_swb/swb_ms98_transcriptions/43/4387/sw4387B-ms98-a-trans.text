sw4387B-ms98-a-0016 75.856000 82.845500 yeah that that that is something i i'd rather it's one of those things where i have a very stressful day at work and then i'll
sw4387B-ms98-a-0017 82.845500 90.162250 get home and let's uh pick pick out a something on the symphony something that will really relax me
sw4387B-ms98-a-0018 90.162250 101.193875 and uh that that's where that is and the one thing uh i guess it's opera's the only kind of music that i i- i don't care for and
sw4387B-ms98-a-0019 101.193875 106.227250 uh traditional country and western which i find [laughter-offensive]
sw4387B-ms98-a-0020 106.227250 123.326500 [laughter]
sw4387B-ms98-a-0021 123.326500 131.531625 yeah like i said it depends upon the mood that i'm in um i- i prefer instrumental more tha[n]- over anything
sw4387B-ms98-a-0022 131.531625 142.151625 but what i don't like is listening to a a station that will play uh i guess it's elevator music where they they have people that re[done]- have redone the song
sw4387B-ms98-a-0023 142.151625 151.680250 it's if if if i'm going to listen to something like White Christmas i want to hear Bing Crosby sing it i don't want to hear somebody else sing it
sw4387B-ms98-a-0024 151.680250 157.430125 um i'm i'm a firm believer in the person who made the song popular that's who i want to listen to
sw4387B-ms98-a-0025 157.430125 159.218625 [silence]
sw4387B-ms98-a-0026 159.218625 161.978625 regardless of how good the remake is [laughter]

sw4387B-ms98-a-0029 172.483750 178.788125 yes that that that's really good i enjoy that um and that's where
sw4387B-ms98-a-0030 178.788125 188.508750 very rarely live recordings of uh symphony music is good where they have to they have to get everyone in the studio to do it right
sw4387B-ms98-a-0031 188.508750 202.447125 depending upon which hall they're in because_1 i've listened to some uh albums or CD's where the live recording they did it in a an auditorium or hall that was horrible the acoustics
sw4387B-ms98-a-0032 202.447125 210.375750 and it just kind of washed out the very highs and the very lows and you had this [vocalized-noise] what sounded like m[ud]- mud music
