sw4310B-ms98-a-0005 13.587125 17.473375 short long-term goals to be able to get
sw4310B-ms98-a-0006 17.473375 19.686875 a better value
sw4310B-ms98-a-0007 19.686875 22.514375 out of what we already pay
sw4310B-ms98-a-0008 22.514375 27.615625 and i wanted to say something to you about Ross Perot are you familiar with the man
sw4310B-ms98-a-0009 27.615625 28.954375 [silence]
sw4310B-ms98-a-0010 28.954375 30.530125 [vocalized-noise] 
sw4310B-ms98-a-0011 30.530125 38.456125 [silence]
sw4310B-ms98-a-0012 38.456125 41.776250 yeah but he does raise some interesting points like
sw4310B-ms98-a-0013 41.776250 49.690125 [silence]
sw4310B-ms98-a-0014 49.690125 51.998250 uh-huh the uh
sw4310B-ms98-a-0015 51.998250 57.145625 the the question he raised in my mind was uh he was speaking in front of the National Press Club the other day
sw4310B-ms98-a-0016 57.145625 63.913500 and he said [vocalized-noise] let's think of some wild and crazy things to do to wipe out the four hundred billion dollar deficit that we've got
sw4310B-ms98-a-0017 63.913500 73.714625 um [vocalized-noise] remember we're thinking about wild and crazy things we'll throw anything out he said um let's say we take all the profits of the fortune five hundred
sw4310B-ms98-a-0018 73.714625 75.171875 for a year
sw4310B-ms98-a-0019 75.171875 76.861750 not enough money
sw4310B-ms98-a-0020 76.861750 79.232750 only half as much as we need
sw4310B-ms98-a-0021 79.232750 81.507000 so another words
sw4310B-ms98-a-0022 81.507000 84.101250 four hundred billion dollars is hell of a lot of money 
sw4310B-ms98-a-0023 84.101250 87.684125 uh and that's just he deficit just this year 
sw4310B-ms98-a-0024 87.684125 94.614500 there's apparently a hundred and eighty billion dollars that the president's own controller will tell you is fault and mismanagement
sw4310B-ms98-a-0025 94.614500 97.369750 i think that would be the short-term goals
sw4310B-ms98-a-0026 97.369750 100.709000 get rid of the fraud and mismanagement
sw4310B-ms98-a-0027 100.709000 103.742000 um apparently they have plenty of time
sw4310B-ms98-a-0028 103.742000 104.775000 [silence]
sw4310B-ms98-a-0029 104.775000 117.982875 the boards right now for computer systems and other tracking methods to get rid of the fraud and everyone says well it's going to cost a billion dollars to implement this well a billion stacked against a hundred and eighty billion sounds like a good investment to me
sw4310B-ms98-a-0030 117.982875 128.167375 [silence]
sw4310B-ms98-a-0031 128.167375 134.592500 it's a human element but the mechanical element of it can i mean mechanical meaning a computer could help
sw4310B-ms98-a-0032 134.592500 136.638750 could help track
sw4310B-ms98-a-0033 136.638750 146.508875 uh and and find out what's going on you know statistical cross-referencing and and uh you know the the pork barrel and all that other stuff that they uh you know
sw4310B-ms98-a-0034 146.508875 150.125375 they do to keep in office to stay in office uh
sw4310B-ms98-a-0035 150.125375 157.720625 i think term limitations are a viable a viable way to cut the amount of money we spend in government
sw4310B-ms98-a-0036 157.720625 163.943750 um if uh you know we we say the president can be limited to two terms and we don't limit
sw4310B-ms98-a-0037 163.943750 166.325000 congress critters at all

sw4310B-ms98-a-0041 184.204125 191.807625 yeah especially now after this rubber gate thing you know they uh it's something that everyone can identify with and
sw4310B-ms98-a-0042 191.807625 192.215500 [noise]
sw4310B-ms98-a-0043 192.215500 199.361375 and uh if they can't even balance their own check book how in the worlds are they going to balance a trillion plus dollar budget

sw4310B-ms98-a-0049 242.549000 246.174750 uh i've been studying some libertarian views
sw4310B-ms98-a-0050 246.174750 251.450125 and i've been thinking more and more that maybe we need to get government out of
sw4310B-ms98-a-0051 251.450125 255.698125 out of business and away from business and out of everybody's hair
