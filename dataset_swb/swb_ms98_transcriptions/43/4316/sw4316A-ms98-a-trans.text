sw4316A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.006875 [silence] 
sw4316A-ms98-a-0002 0.006875 7.442000 do you think that there's any way that uh or do you think there's too much crime now i mean i guess any crime is too much but it's out of control
sw4316A-ms98-a-0003 7.442000 41.376000 [silence]
sw4316A-ms98-a-0004 41.376000 42.886250 really
sw4316A-ms98-a-0005 42.886250 46.191750 i would not of i okay_1 i wouldn't have guessed that in Seattle
sw4316A-ms98-a-0006 46.191750 48.694000 yeah i know
sw4316A-ms98-a-0007 48.694000 55.289375 [silence]
sw4316A-ms98-a-0008 55.289375 58.733875 yeah i wonder i mean i wonder [vocalized-noise] what
sw4316A-ms98-a-0009 58.733875 68.473000 what really is the answer i mean it seems like our our the prison systems we can't seem to decide whether or not it's a reform system or a penal system
sw4316A-ms98-a-0010 68.473000 70.235750 [silence]
sw4316A-ms98-a-0011 70.235750 71.603625 yeah
sw4316A-ms98-a-0012 71.603625 76.599750 [silence]
sw4316A-ms98-a-0013 76.599750 87.923500 but but the problem is th[at]- that we we only have but so much room and we we try to put aside in the warehouse and all we do is just displace other people which come back into society and commit crimes and
sw4316A-ms98-a-0014 87.923500 89.963750 so it's uh
sw4316A-ms98-a-0015 89.963750 95.220375 [silence]
sw4316A-ms98-a-0016 95.220375 99.026750 i get the feeling that a lot of people have i'm not convinced that i have
sw4316A-ms98-a-0017 99.026750 108.996875 um see i mean my mom taught English as a second language a[nd]- and and she was dealing mostly with people that were were in on drug crimes and um
sw4316A-ms98-a-0018 108.996875 121.925250 yes in a in a maximum security prison down in central Virginia and the problem she had was not with the inmates at all the the people that she had the most problems with were the people that ran the prison i mean
sw4316A-ms98-a-0019 121.925250 129.183250 it was it was i mean they they put her i mean i didn't obviously didn't see the classroom u[m]- um [laughter-and] hopefully never will
sw4316A-ms98-a-0020 129.183250 137.466000 but uh they they put her at the end of a hallway there were no other classes going on at the time and they refused to let her wear a body a[larm]- a body alarm
sw4316A-ms98-a-0021 137.466000 144.033250 which i know i don't know exactly what that is but i just assume it's something that she could hit immediately and and really annoy a lot of people
sw4316A-ms98-a-0022 144.033250 145.556125 but uh
sw4316A-ms98-a-0023 145.556125 148.147125 [vocalized-noise] you know i- i'd ge[t]-
sw4316A-ms98-a-0024 148.147125 161.223500 no she didn't she didn't she she felt fine for the first year when she had her first set of inmates and then later on the uh the administration kept getting worse and uh she got a couple of inmates that she wasn't she didn't feel quite as comfortable around
sw4316A-ms98-a-0025 161.223500 171.392000 but well she had decided that it was when we came back to the states she decided that it was too she didn't feel that public schools were were safe so next thing you know she's teaching in a maximum security prison
sw4316A-ms98-a-0026 171.392000 173.145250 but uh
sw4316A-ms98-a-0027 173.145250 175.128750 [silence]
sw4316A-ms98-a-0028 175.128750 189.384125 yeah but but the point there was is that it you know you said that perhaps uh people have given up the thought that rehabilitation's possible and and i'm i'm thinking that it's even to the point that the people in that run the system have given up on it
sw4316A-ms98-a-0029 189.384125 195.327125 [silence]
sw4316A-ms98-a-0030 195.327125 196.808625 um-hum
sw4316A-ms98-a-0031 196.808625 207.301375 [silence]
sw4316A-ms98-a-0032 207.301375 215.883000 but getting i mean [vocalized-noise] well see i always have problems because because i can never decide whether or not i'm i'm supposed to be a conservative or or a liberal but
sw4316A-ms98-a-0033 215.883000 217.432000 but i kee[p]-
sw4316A-ms98-a-0034 217.432000 221.751750 i keep thinking that there's got to be some way that that a lot of this is
sw4316A-ms98-a-0035 221.751750 232.648500 circumstances i mean i can't help but wonder if if i grew up without a father on the streets and with like little or no money wouldn't wouldn't i be in prison at this point or another
sw4316A-ms98-a-0036 232.648500 236.036750 [silence]
sw4316A-ms98-a-0037 236.036750 239.128500 i mean i don't know i don't know
sw4316A-ms98-a-0038 239.128500 249.232375 [silence]
sw4316A-ms98-a-0039 249.232375 255.414875 we got methadone programs where people who desperately wanna get off drugs can't get onto the program
sw4316A-ms98-a-0040 255.414875 259.915500 [silence]
sw4316A-ms98-a-0041 259.915500 267.281125 i don't i don't remember the the gentleman's name but there's the uh the mayor of Baltimore is a is a Rhodes Scholar and what he
sw4316A-ms98-a-0042 267.281125 269.538125 [silence]
sw4316A-ms98-a-0043 269.538125 277.763125 well what he wants to do is take all the money that um he gets for drug enforcement and use it for uh drug education
sw4316A-ms98-a-0044 277.763125 283.415875 and basically just just attack the problem at the demand side
sw4316A-ms98-a-0045 283.415875 297.378000 stop trying to attack supply because which which to some extent makes sense and to some extent doesn't i mean Switzerland tried the the grand experiment and you know they had this park where they were letting anybody use drugs as long as they stayed in the park and
