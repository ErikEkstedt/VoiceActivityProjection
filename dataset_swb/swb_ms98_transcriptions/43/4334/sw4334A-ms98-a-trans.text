sw4334A-ms98-a-0016 63.686750 67.280500 i i didn't like uh they started getting a little more
sw4334A-ms98-a-0017 67.280500 74.229000 you know the type of music a[t]- at least to me it's uh sounds like it's only sounds good at a high volumes and i don't like listening at high volumes
sw4334A-ms98-a-0018 74.229000 79.943500 but uh some of their older s[tuff]- stuff was uh you know quite enjoyable to me

sw4334A-ms98-a-0022 87.371500 94.493875 [silence]
sw4334A-ms98-a-0023 94.493875 98.964375 well down in Texas uh you know little listen to a little country every now and then
sw4334A-ms98-a-0024 98.964375 101.972875 i'm s[ure]- i'm sure there's a lot of that down there
sw4334A-ms98-a-0025 101.972875 103.600750 [silence]
sw4334A-ms98-a-0026 103.600750 105.184125 [laughter]
sw4334A-ms98-a-0027 105.184125 108.974500 [silence]

sw4334A-ms98-a-0029 117.492250 119.450000 [silence]
sw4334A-ms98-a-0030 119.450000 120.750000 yeah
sw4334A-ms98-a-0031 120.750000 128.551375 [silence]
sw4334A-ms98-a-0032 128.551375 132.318500 yeah i think some of them the artists are even uh hitting the pop charts
sw4334A-ms98-a-0033 132.318500 150.958750 [silence]
sw4334A-ms98-a-0034 150.958750 155.177875 hey i i i think most artists are in to make a few bucks
sw4334A-ms98-a-0035 155.177875 162.809250 but they're not in it to say anything or give a message which is what they were do late late sixties early seventies they were they were definitely pushing a message
sw4334A-ms98-a-0036 162.809250 166.716375 [silence]
sw4334A-ms98-a-0037 166.716375 172.576500 yeah and i don't i don't think gun at least to my mind Guns and Roses doesn't have too much of a message too much to say
sw4334A-ms98-a-0038 172.576500 180.626625 [silence]
sw4334A-ms98-a-0039 180.626625 181.945125 uh-huh
sw4334A-ms98-a-0040 181.945125 193.573125 [silence]
sw4334A-ms98-a-0041 193.573125 194.864250 right
sw4334A-ms98-a-0042 194.864250 198.173500 [silence]
sw4334A-ms98-a-0043 198.173500 199.479750 right
sw4334A-ms98-a-0044 199.479750 202.571250 [silence]
sw4334A-ms98-a-0045 202.571250 203.967125 uh-huh [laughter]
sw4334A-ms98-a-0046 203.967125 206.275875 [silence]
sw4334A-ms98-a-0047 206.275875 209.901000 yeah i[t]- i[t]- it's the artist not the merit
sw4334A-ms98-a-0048 209.901000 217.233375 [silence]
sw4334A-ms98-a-0049 217.233375 218.515000 yeah
sw4334A-ms98-a-0050 218.515000 221.404625 [silence]
sw4334A-ms98-a-0051 221.404625 232.433375 well i don't know i know for myself that uh for the most part i don't know which artist is which so i listen to a song i either like the song or i don't like it and then if i really like the song eventually i'll figure out who it was
sw4334A-ms98-a-0052 232.433375 244.000000 [silence]
sw4334A-ms98-a-0053 244.000000 248.462750 well you have to figure out what to buy or do you just buy along the same artist an[d]-
sw4334A-ms98-a-0054 248.462750 253.862875 [silence]
sw4334A-ms98-a-0055 253.862875 255.150000 yeah
sw4334A-ms98-a-0056 255.150000 258.065250 [silence]
sw4334A-ms98-a-0057 258.065250 261.910000 yeah so you keep buying the same artists until you don't like an album then you stop
sw4334A-ms98-a-0058 261.910000 267.672250 [silence]
sw4334A-ms98-a-0059 267.672250 269.539750 yeah
sw4334A-ms98-a-0060 269.539750 276.075625 [silence]
sw4334A-ms98-a-0061 276.075625 283.769000 yeah see that's one thing i like about the uh some of the folk music scenes you know there's a couple of nice uh small coffee houses up in New Jersey
sw4334A-ms98-a-0062 283.769000 290.123750 and it's very nice you go into the coffee house and you know an artist is there and very often the artist will have a d[emo]- an album
sw4334A-ms98-a-0063 290.123750 292.808625 and so if you like the artist you buy the album
sw4334A-ms98-a-0064 292.808625 295.472250 so you definitely get to try before you buy
sw4334A-ms98-a-0065 295.472250 296.692375 [silence]
sw4334A-ms98-a-0066 296.692375 299.618000 though it you you you don't always quite get it right
