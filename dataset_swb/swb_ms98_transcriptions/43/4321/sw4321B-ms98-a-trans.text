sw4321B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.526875 [noise]
sw4321B-ms98-a-0002 0.526875 1.810375 [silence]
sw4321B-ms98-a-0003 1.810375 6.486375 no i've not i've been called but i had to beg off from the duty
sw4321B-ms98-a-0004 6.486375 7.722250 and you
sw4321B-ms98-a-0005 7.722250 11.340000 [silence]
sw4321B-ms98-a-0006 11.340000 12.719625 um
sw4321B-ms98-a-0007 12.719625 16.535000 well i was i was uh originally chosen
sw4321B-ms98-a-0008 16.535000 20.339750 primarily i think because i was a young fellow and they tend to view
sw4321B-ms98-a-0009 20.339750 25.124000 younger fellows as more likely to hand down a guilty verdict i don't know why
sw4321B-ms98-a-0010 25.124000 28.618000 something i picked up in a psychology class some time ago
sw4321B-ms98-a-0011 28.618000 35.502250 yeah it's that the younger they are they tend to be more conservative for some statistical oddball reason
sw4321B-ms98-a-0012 35.502250 37.478500 and
sw4321B-ms98-a-0013 37.478500 43.882250 they kind of liked me i looked [laughter-conser[vative]-] and all that stuff and they i don't know what they saw in me but they saw it
sw4321B-ms98-a-0014 43.882250 47.266500 but uh back to the issue is uh
sw4321B-ms98-a-0015 47.266500 48.405125 [silence]
sw4321B-ms98-a-0016 48.405125 54.996000 i don't know at times i feel that a unanimous decision
sw4321B-ms98-a-0017 54.996000 56.543500 is warranted
sw4321B-ms98-a-0018 56.543500 60.013000 especially in cases in which there's no smoking gun
sw4321B-ms98-a-0019 60.013000 64.689250 but there too there are also cases in which i feel a majority rule
sw4321B-ms98-a-0020 64.689250 66.450250 might be acceptable
sw4321B-ms98-a-0021 66.450250 70.000875 particularly i think in civil cases in criminal cases
sw4321B-ms98-a-0022 70.000875 73.959000 i'd like to see the unani[mity]- unanimity remain
sw4321B-ms98-a-0023 73.959000 79.235000 but in civil cases i think a majority rule by by jury would be be sufficient
sw4321B-ms98-a-0024 79.235000 84.050500 [silence]
sw4321B-ms98-a-0025 84.050500 87.394250 well in a criminal case say one in which
sw4321B-ms98-a-0026 87.394250 93.703500 you know there is like say assault or some such i think there ought to be a unanimous uh vote because
sw4321B-ms98-a-0027 93.703500 96.931500 by law and by constitution there must be
sw4321B-ms98-a-0028 96.931500 102.104625 proven beyond a shadow of a reasonable doubt that the person in question did this
sw4321B-ms98-a-0029 102.104625 104.178375 and in civil law
sw4321B-ms98-a-0030 104.178375 108.284875 there you know is such a thing as like let's say uh
sw4321B-ms98-a-0031 108.284875 109.299375 [silence]
sw4321B-ms98-a-0032 109.299375 114.259750 misappropriations or misuse of financial instruments or something like that
sw4321B-ms98-a-0033 114.259750 116.752750 a majority rule i think would be
sw4321B-ms98-a-0034 116.752750 118.565375 more in line
sw4321B-ms98-a-0035 118.565375 121.677250 as there is no real smoking gun
sw4321B-ms98-a-0036 121.677250 123.167000 in the civil cases
sw4321B-ms98-a-0037 123.167000 124.570250 [silence]
sw4321B-ms98-a-0038 124.570250 127.335875 i don't know if i'm making any sense or not
sw4321B-ms98-a-0039 127.335875 141.904750 [silence]
sw4321B-ms98-a-0040 141.904750 145.434750 yeah often there's more incriminating evidence
sw4321B-ms98-a-0041 145.434750 148.357875 like for instance say um
sw4321B-ms98-a-0042 148.357875 154.515250 and also too i think i'm i'm tempering this and the fact that the consequences are much more uh serious
sw4321B-ms98-a-0043 154.515250 156.360000 in a criminal case
sw4321B-ms98-a-0044 156.360000 165.492375 [silence]
sw4321B-ms98-a-0045 165.492375 166.828500 hm
sw4321B-ms98-a-0046 166.828500 168.705125 well
sw4321B-ms98-a-0047 168.705125 170.881375 i really can't say for certain
sw4321B-ms98-a-0048 170.881375 173.570875 truth be known um
sw4321B-ms98-a-0049 173.570875 180.546125 as it stands there's there's many ways and means by which a person can be set up both uh in a [civinal/civil] uh civil and criminal case
sw4321B-ms98-a-0050 180.546125 182.285500 i mean the uh
sw4321B-ms98-a-0051 182.285500 184.185250 documentary The Thin Blue Line
sw4321B-ms98-a-0052 184.185250 186.170875 pretty much demonstrated that
sw4321B-ms98-a-0053 186.170875 189.128875 you know i don't know for if you're familiar with that or not
sw4321B-ms98-a-0054 189.128875 190.388625 [silence]
sw4321B-ms98-a-0055 190.388625 193.995250 uh a fellow when he was much younger um
sw4321B-ms98-a-0056 193.995250 196.597750 was tried and convicted and sentenced to death
sw4321B-ms98-a-0057 196.597750 203.105625 fortunately in his case the death penalty was revoked and uh so he served out his his sentence
sw4321B-ms98-a-0058 203.105625 207.406000 until it was discovered by a fellow who was making a documentary called the Thin Blue Line 
sw4321B-ms98-a-0059 207.406000 212.977125 that this guy had basically gotten railroaded through the judicial system the case was reopened and he was exonerated
sw4321B-ms98-a-0060 212.977125 222.627125 [silence]
sw4321B-ms98-a-0061 222.627125 224.980000 yeah many laws but little justice
sw4321B-ms98-a-0062 224.980000 241.973750 [silence]
sw4321B-ms98-a-0063 241.973750 243.656500 oh certainly not
sw4321B-ms98-a-0064 243.656500 245.482125 certainly not
sw4321B-ms98-a-0065 245.482125 253.078250 and you know they like to think that they're getting someone who's objective in all this but they're really looking for someone who will
sw4321B-ms98-a-0066 253.078250 259.552375 pretty much fulfill the lawyer's desires you know the because you get up and
sw4321B-ms98-a-0067 259.552375 269.993250 and they ask you a few questions both sides do and then you you're either challenged which is you know each attorney can use that as much as they like
sw4321B-ms98-a-0068 269.993250 273.632750 or i think it's a limit now they probably limit now
sw4321B-ms98-a-0069 273.632750 277.679000 but they pretty much go through that and
sw4321B-ms98-a-0070 277.679000 283.532375 then you have to give a reason to the court why you can't serve for me it was financial hardship
sw4321B-ms98-a-0071 283.532375 294.099625 so but onto the thing um i was never aware that juries had any say on recommending sentencing it was always my impression
sw4321B-ms98-a-0072 294.099625 298.768625 that the justice himself or herself had the final say
sw4321B-ms98-a-0073 298.768625 299.938000 [silence]
