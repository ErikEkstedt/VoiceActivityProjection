sw4362B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 8.330375 [noise] uh well [noise] uh having sort of recently gone through the school system i seem to be younger than most people who who talk on this thing i'm i'm just graduating coll[ege]-
sw4362B-ms98-a-0002 8.330375 19.352250 graduating from college uh i didn't really perceive much of a of a problem with the school system however when you compare it to school systems like
sw4362B-ms98-a-0003 19.352250 26.206125 they have in Japan and a[gain]- you can compare just about everyth[ing]- thing to Japan and we look like w[e]- we don't have anything
sw4362B-ms98-a-0004 26.206125 34.563250 [noise] um it seems to be not difficult enough for students not challenging enough and just not generally competitive enough
sw4362B-ms98-a-0005 34.563250 46.107625 um however i if it weren't for our needless uh [noise] competition with Japan i i'd i'd think that that the school systems system works at a pretty good pace

sw4362B-ms98-a-0010 69.902125 84.730625 [silence]
sw4362B-ms98-a-0011 84.730625 86.100375 yeah
sw4362B-ms98-a-0012 86.100375 88.718250 [silence]
sw4362B-ms98-a-0013 88.718250 90.085000 hm

sw4362B-ms98-a-0015 101.093500 102.310250 right

sw4362B-ms98-a-0019 119.023875 130.603000 [noise] uh well i- i don't pretend to understand that either uh but i'm not quite sure that it's the kind of thing that ought to be blamed on the schools but then again i'm not quite sure where the blame ought to be put
sw4362B-ms98-a-0020 130.603000 134.655000 um because the the dropout rate is
sw4362B-ms98-a-0021 134.655000 147.845000 in those areas it's it's high in those areas where also there's poverty and and crime and they all seem to go together and it seems like if you could eliminate one of of the parts of that circle
sw4362B-ms98-a-0022 147.845000 153.610125 whether wherever you have the dropout rate and crime and you know general poverty kind of conditions
sw4362B-ms98-a-0023 153.610125 166.314375 that things ought to get better so uh a[nd]- the other two a[ll]- oh they're all three social issues and could be addressed by the government in anyways and clearly to me is a kind of government thing to
sw4362B-ms98-a-0024 166.314375 179.008375 to fix but it's just like i i don't expect them to know which which which part is best to fix just like i don't know it's it's a complicated issue i i still don't think i would d[irectly]- blame it directly on the school
sw4362B-ms98-a-0025 179.008375 189.319250 [silence]
sw4362B-ms98-a-0026 189.319250 191.719500 well that's what i meant when i said the school
sw4362B-ms98-a-0027 191.719500 205.598625 [silence]
sw4362B-ms98-a-0028 205.598625 212.444625 hm well that that's odd because i don't think the teachers in my school district uh were well paid
sw4362B-ms98-a-0029 212.444625 224.258375 [silence]
sw4362B-ms98-a-0030 224.258375 225.682750 um-hum

sw4362B-ms98-a-0036 256.621750 268.567125 yeah w[ell]- w[ell]- well that's true but that there's you can always play games with uh talking about whoa look at this my tax dollars are paying for this this is wrong
sw4362B-ms98-a-0037 268.567125 277.831000 but when you're talk [vocalized-noise] and there's really not much you can directly do about that i think that that if if there is a problem with the school system [noise]
sw4362B-ms98-a-0038 277.831000 284.120000 uh from m[y]- it's been my perception that the school teachers and school officials are not that well uh
sw4362B-ms98-a-0039 284.120000 297.186000 uh paid that perhaps that might be one area that that could be improved uh wh[ere]- you have other professional jobs and thi[s]- this is a profession and as a matter of fact it's a pretty big influence on on
