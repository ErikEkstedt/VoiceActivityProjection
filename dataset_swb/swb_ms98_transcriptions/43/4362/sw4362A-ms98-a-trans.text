sw4362A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 46.267750 [silence]
sw4362A-ms98-a-0002 46.267750 56.502750 i don't know um i haven't it's been um well seventy nine since i was at school at high school and um
sw4362A-ms98-a-0003 56.502750 59.640125 [vocalized-noise] i've seen things change
sw4362A-ms98-a-0004 59.640125 69.934625 i don't know if i've seen things change enough that i can actually because i wasn't really like listening to the world go by back then so it's hard to compare you know what i mean
sw4362A-ms98-a-0005 69.934625 71.844500 but um
sw4362A-ms98-a-0006 71.844500 80.907500 it seems like [vocalized-noise] when i li[ved]- i lived in Chicago i've i've lived down here i hear the dropout rates from the schools
sw4362A-ms98-a-0007 80.907500 85.570125 and i certainly see how much i pay in real estate taxes every year
sw4362A-ms98-a-0008 85.570125 89.125750 and i begin to wonder if i'm really getting my money's worth
sw4362A-ms98-a-0009 89.125750 93.689750 i mean i i've seen so many different things
sw4362A-ms98-a-0010 93.689750 105.719000 so so many different bad reports coming out of the school system and i recognize that there are good schools out there i mean somebody's getting getting a good education because we continue to employ people
sw4362A-ms98-a-0011 105.719000 107.494250 but um
sw4362A-ms98-a-0012 107.494250 111.602250 i don't i don't understand the um
sw4362A-ms98-a-0013 111.602250 118.616500 i don't understand i guess why the schools don['t]- seem to have such a high dropout rate in the big cities
sw4362A-ms98-a-0014 118.616500 178.916625 [silence]
sw4362A-ms98-a-0015 178.916625 189.223500 i don't know if i blame it on the school i think i think i blame it i think i blame it on a couple of different things i think i blame it on the school system
sw4362A-ms98-a-0016 189.223500 191.003250 um
sw4362A-ms98-a-0017 191.003250 202.031375 yeah [vocalized-noise] i don't blame it on the teachers in the school i although i think that i do know for a fact that some of the teachers that i know personally get paid an awful lot more than
sw4362A-ms98-a-0018 202.031375 206.643625 well [noise] they do quite well for themselves [laughter]
sw4362A-ms98-a-0019 206.643625 212.874250 [silence]
sw4362A-ms98-a-0020 212.874250 221.497750 no not all school districts are well paid but there are some school districts out there that are very well paid i mean i know one family that's got they're both teachers
sw4362A-ms98-a-0021 221.497750 233.481000 and they both have like second jobs that they work in the afternoons they both work all summer full-time and from their teaching job alone they pull in forty grand each
sw4362A-ms98-a-0022 233.481000 242.544750 i mean that family is making over a hundred grand and i'm i mean okay okay yes i agree that teaching our kids is important
sw4362A-ms98-a-0023 242.544750 252.495500 however these people who only work eight hours a day at it from seven to three and they only work nine months a year and they get an awful lot of breaks in between
sw4362A-ms98-a-0024 252.495500 257.896375 and that's my tax dollars that i'm spending on that and i don't even have kids [laughter]
