sw4369A-ms98-a-0013 46.819625 50.851625 was that the rape murder of that sixteen year old girl in a school
sw4369A-ms98-a-0014 50.851625 53.902750 [silence]
sw4369A-ms98-a-0015 53.902750 58.894375 there was something like something like that on Sixty Minutes about two years ago [noise]
sw4369A-ms98-a-0016 58.894375 66.228375 [silence]
sw4369A-ms98-a-0017 66.228375 67.735250 um-hum hm

sw4369A-ms98-a-0019 68.848750 75.562250 [silence]
sw4369A-ms98-a-0020 75.562250 79.960625 i don't find very many [laughter] that support mine
sw4369A-ms98-a-0021 79.960625 85.334125 well actually i mean not not with regard to capital punishment i mean just in general the media um
sw4369A-ms98-a-0022 85.334125 92.558500 uh they ta[ke]- the the the the the average person in the media is far more liberal than the average person in the rest of the country and so 
sw4369A-ms98-a-0023 92.558500 107.047000 uh views that are more conservative just don't get adequately represented in the mainstream media that's been documented by a number of studies but on capital punishment look that's an exception [laughter-i'm] [laughter-not] conservative on that i'm sort of middle of the road i- i lean against capital punishment but
sw4369A-ms98-a-0024 107.047000 121.319750 i- i wouldn't be an activist on it cause there's so many more important things i think i mean i admit that some innocent people get killed and i believe you're correct that has been documented it happens occasionally and it's very th[at]- th[at]- that's that's quite unfortunate 
sw4369A-ms98-a-0025 121.319750 140.123375 [silence]
sw4369A-ms98-a-0026 140.123375 149.553875 hm well that last caller actually i- i [laughter] this is the first time i've ever spoken about a topic for the second time but the last caller that i discussed it with didn't
sw4369A-ms98-a-0027 149.553875 155.459375 didn't say you know even that even the the fraction that would be represented among criminals are convicted more often
sw4369A-ms98-a-0028 155.459375 169.187500 and in fact i just asked him the question is it is it true that isn't it true that minorities you know from peo[ple]- in general people from lower socioeconomic groups tend to commit more violent crime and so wouldn't you expect them_1 to be [committed/convicted] to to be convicted more often [noise] 
sw4369A-ms98-a-0029 169.187500 175.992125 now i do think i recall seeing some statistics to to the effect that that you that you mentioned um [noise]
sw4369A-ms98-a-0030 175.992125 184.322500 i don't know that you know maybe it was a r[eport]- a news report i heard or something where i couldn't check it out very carefully where i couldn't i i always tend to read over these things you know
sw4369A-ms98-a-0031 184.322500 195.870000 especially if you have an interest group that comes up with a study that supports their own position if they did the work i always tend to be a little suspicious of it and that might've been the Southern Poverty Law Project or something that did that
sw4369A-ms98-a-0032 195.870000 204.020750 and so i don't know whether i necessa[rily]- [laughter] whether i wanna give credence to that without looking into it but i do remember hearing that yeah
sw4369A-ms98-a-0033 204.020750 206.483125 [silence]
sw4369A-ms98-a-0034 206.483125 207.669125 um-hum

sw4369A-ms98-a-0037 211.446500 212.566500 um-hum
sw4369A-ms98-a-0038 212.566500 218.876125 [noise] yeah well i'm i mean i- i- i agree i think that that the problem with capital punishment is that it's irrevocable
sw4369A-ms98-a-0039 218.876125 227.603500 if you find out you put somebody in jail wrongly you can just let them_1 out if you find out that you you killed somebody wrongly there's nothing you can do to bring them back to life so
sw4369A-ms98-a-0040 227.603500 238.278000 so that's definitely a problem and um you know [noise] well [laughter] we're supposed to talk about our state i guess according to the synopsis at the beginning so North Carolina has capital punishment well [noise]
sw4369A-ms98-a-0041 238.278000 245.620875 if if North Carolina didn't have capital punishment i wouldn't try and institute it it it does have capital punishment i don't see that it does any good
sw4369A-ms98-a-0042 245.620875 251.252250 they might convict somebody wrongly sometime that's unfortunate but um [noise] you know fa[rther]-
sw4369A-ms98-a-0043 251.252250 260.838375 the fortunate thing really is th[at]- that it occurs so rarely uh i think we have about uh maybe one execution or a little bit less a year in North Carolina now i
sw4369A-ms98-a-0044 260.838375 267.402750 i know there're some states like i think Texas is probably the leader in the country i'm not sure of that but i think it may be is that right

sw4369A-ms98-a-0048 276.736375 280.077500 [silence]
sw4369A-ms98-a-0049 280.077500 292.272000 yeah i think that that you know most southern states tend to have capital punishment more than northern states and a state like Minnesota for example i don't know but i'd be almost sure that they don't have capital punishments Wis[consin]- Wisconsin the same way
sw4369A-ms98-a-0050 292.272000 295.198625 [silence]
