sw4369B-ms98-a-0003 3.087000 6.938125 um i'm against capital punishment um
sw4369B-ms98-a-0004 6.938125 9.414250 i- i guess there's a cliche that
sw4369B-ms98-a-0005 9.414250 24.206125 um for every thousand criminals let free if one innocent person is uh killed that that's a terrible thing for the state to be doing and i agree i remember watching a a documentary film a couple of years ago
sw4369B-ms98-a-0006 24.206125 35.304125 i've forgotten the name of it now but it was about a killing in Texas where somebody was sentenced i think it may have been just to life imprisonment but in any event it may have been capital punishment but uh
sw4369B-ms98-a-0007 35.304125 48.334750 this documentari[an]- documentarian or whatever you wanna say um he uh interviewed all the parties involved and basically got another person to admit that he had been the one who had committed the murder i don't know [vocalized-noise]
sw4369B-ms98-a-0008 48.334750 50.113250 [silence]
sw4369B-ms98-a-0009 50.113250 55.674875 um no i don't think so it was a i don't remember the circumstances actually i- i just remember
sw4369B-ms98-a-0010 55.674875 57.117000 [silence]
sw4369B-ms98-a-0011 57.117000 60.488125 no no this was documentary um
sw4369B-ms98-a-0012 60.488125 70.086500 [noise] it was a a you know in released in theaters i saw it on PBS finally i guess um but any event it was it was very interesting and it 
sw4369B-ms98-a-0013 70.086500 77.180625 you know i guess [laughter] they say that you look for views in the media that support your own and [laughter] maybe maybe that's the bias here
sw4369B-ms98-a-0014 77.180625 81.284125 [laughter] well what's your um perspective on capital punishment
sw4369B-ms98-a-0015 81.284125 83.913250 [silence]
sw4369B-ms98-a-0016 83.913250 85.250750 um-hum
sw4369B-ms98-a-0017 85.250750 120.048500 [silence]
sw4369B-ms98-a-0018 120.048500 122.654000 and there's also the factor that
sw4369B-ms98-a-0019 122.654000 135.510250 that there's obviously racism in terms of even though certain minorities might commit a higher percentage of crimes than they are represented in the overall population they are also c[onvicted]- convicted of capital crimes
sw4369B-ms98-a-0020 135.510250 142.092125 and sentenced to capital punishment at a higher percentage than they're represented even among criminals so that's
sw4369B-ms98-a-0021 142.092125 146.473375 [silence]
sw4369B-ms98-a-0022 146.473375 147.884875 oh really

sw4369B-ms98-a-0027 189.536500 191.185500 right
sw4369B-ms98-a-0028 191.185500 192.885750 i think
sw4369B-ms98-a-0029 192.885750 195.159875 [silence]
sw4369B-ms98-a-0030 195.159875 196.603250 i don't know
sw4369B-ms98-a-0031 196.603250 202.234750 [silence]
sw4369B-ms98-a-0032 202.234750 212.940625 um-hum i think some bar associations um a lot of bar associations are against capital punishment and um this is one area where perhaps they've done some of the work i'm not sure
sw4369B-ms98-a-0033 212.940625 235.236375 [silence]
sw4369B-ms98-a-0034 235.236375 236.582000 right

sw4369B-ms98-a-0037 246.390250 259.677375 [silence]
sw4369B-ms98-a-0038 259.677375 261.154500 is that so
sw4369B-ms98-a-0039 261.154500 265.939000 [silence]
sw4369B-ms98-a-0040 265.939000 267.805625 i'm not sure i think
sw4369B-ms98-a-0041 267.805625 281.070500 [vocalized-noise] that sounds right offhand but i'm not positive i- i have only recently moved to Kentucky so i'm not even sure what Kentucky's law is my guess is it's probably legal but probably similar to Carolina that it's not used very frequently
sw4369B-ms98-a-0042 281.070500 284.396500 [silence]
sw4369B-ms98-a-0043 284.396500 285.667500 right

sw4369B-ms98-a-0045 289.630500 290.996625 right
sw4369B-ms98-a-0046 290.996625 297.986000 right i was living in Illinois before here and i'm virtually certain that they didn't have it or if they did have it it was never used
