sw4350A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 8.670250 [noise] well i think that there's uh a few things i would like to see um in the work environment that could improve things and number one is um
sw4350A-ms98-a-0002 8.670250 21.953750 health benefits things like uh insurance for number one but another would be like um [noise] facilities or the ease some easy way to go out and exercise or something like that if you felt like it in the middle the day 
sw4350A-ms98-a-0003 21.953750 30.250250 [silence]
sw4350A-ms98-a-0004 30.250250 32.828250 um yeah same here
sw4350A-ms98-a-0005 32.828250 38.971125 [silence]
sw4350A-ms98-a-0006 38.971125 40.727000 um
sw4350A-ms98-a-0007 40.727000 42.181000 [silence]
sw4350A-ms98-a-0008 42.181000 43.575625 yeah
sw4350A-ms98-a-0009 43.575625 44.864250 [silence]
sw4350A-ms98-a-0010 44.864250 46.517375 yeah
sw4350A-ms98-a-0011 46.517375 57.725750 [silence]
sw4350A-ms98-a-0012 57.725750 62.609750 another one i'd like to see would be in flexible scheduling of hours
sw4350A-ms98-a-0013 62.609750 63.839000 [silence]
sw4350A-ms98-a-0014 63.839000 65.972750 [noise] yeah [noise]
sw4350A-ms98-a-0015 65.972750 70.990375 [noise] well right now i'm still in school i'm still a student but the ability to
sw4350A-ms98-a-0016 70.990375 82.128125 you know kind of have a little bit of freedom over that to schedule your work from day to day from week to week so every once in a while you can slip in a three day weekend without having to use a day vacation or or just something like that
sw4350A-ms98-a-0017 82.128125 87.662500 feel like taking a class at night and you just come in earlier for a while or something like that
sw4350A-ms98-a-0018 87.662500 89.657750 and
sw4350A-ms98-a-0019 89.657750 91.877875 [silence]
sw4350A-ms98-a-0020 91.877875 93.487500 [noise] yeah
sw4350A-ms98-a-0021 93.487500 95.695125 [silence]
sw4350A-ms98-a-0022 95.695125 97.189625 [noise]
sw4350A-ms98-a-0023 97.189625 98.871625 [silence]
sw4350A-ms98-a-0024 98.871625 102.412500 [vocalized-noise]
sw4350A-ms98-a-0025 102.412500 105.024000 [silence]
sw4350A-ms98-a-0026 105.024000 107.265375 yeah that can be rough
sw4350A-ms98-a-0027 107.265375 111.069250 yeah i did that for about a year and had my fill of that
sw4350A-ms98-a-0028 111.069250 114.765625 [noise] swore to never do it again
sw4350A-ms98-a-0029 114.765625 123.320000 i think another thing um would be nice i guess this is more of an overall really nebulous kind of thing would be consideration of
sw4350A-ms98-a-0030 123.320000 129.862625 um [noise] like the family in some in somebody's in the way that somebody relates to the work place
sw4350A-ms98-a-0031 129.862625 136.625125 um well an example would be in the military they give a whole lot of allowances for family people they even get paid more
sw4350A-ms98-a-0032 136.625125 139.251375 they get um allowances for
sw4350A-ms98-a-0033 139.251375 148.225000 um you know have being married or having children i don't really think that that is fair i think uh equal work equal pay for equal work ought to be applied in that case
sw4350A-ms98-a-0034 148.225000 152.022625 but um they get housing and stuff like that [noise]
sw4350A-ms98-a-0035 152.022625 154.652000 [silence]
sw4350A-ms98-a-0036 154.652000 160.737375 and other considerations as well you know their the duty is a little bit different and stuff like that
sw4350A-ms98-a-0037 160.737375 170.910250 but that you know recently there was some kind of documentary on some station i don't know what and some guy was on there he was a middle level manager and he was talking about how
sw4350A-ms98-a-0038 170.910250 182.736625 you know here he'd spent all these years putting in fifty hour weeks um you know for these various places he'd worked at now you know here he was totally unemployed and been unemployed for nine months and it got him absolutely nothing
sw4350A-ms98-a-0039 182.736625 185.615250 some kind of consideration there would be nice as well
sw4350A-ms98-a-0040 185.615250 188.890375 i don't know what would be the solution i suppose uh
sw4350A-ms98-a-0041 188.890375 192.383625 not foolishly giving an extra ten hours a week to some place
sw4350A-ms98-a-0042 192.383625 195.743750 if they're just gonna pork you in the end
sw4350A-ms98-a-0043 195.743750 205.487750 [silence]
sw4350A-ms98-a-0044 205.487750 207.168125 yeah
sw4350A-ms98-a-0045 207.168125 209.010000 yeah
sw4350A-ms98-a-0046 209.010000 218.053125 [silence]
sw4350A-ms98-a-0047 218.053125 221.238125 yeah it's a good consideration for families
sw4350A-ms98-a-0048 221.238125 225.063125 that's absolute necessity in today's world and price
sw4350A-ms98-a-0049 225.063125 227.850500 man they're getting so expensive
sw4350A-ms98-a-0050 227.850500 232.172250 right now i don't have any health insurance it's kind of disturbing unless you
sw4350A-ms98-a-0051 232.172250 236.668625 no i'm gonna be thirty this year but [laughter]
sw4350A-ms98-a-0052 236.668625 239.484250 and yeah i'm working on my PhD
sw4350A-ms98-a-0053 239.484250 250.513750 it's a long road [noise] but the insurance they have at school is kind of uh they've got a really minimum plan and it'll cover you you know and as a student you don't need a whole lot if
sw4350A-ms98-a-0054 250.513750 260.752750 if you lose a leg or something like that you just need the skin folded over you know you know just something to keep you alive till you graduate and make some money and i suppose can go out and get it fixed then
sw4350A-ms98-a-0055 260.752750 263.200000 Georgia Tech in Atlanta
sw4350A-ms98-a-0056 263.200000 274.070250 [noise] but man it is just uh really expensive two years ago it was two hundred dollars for the basic uh major medical and the next year it was four hundred you know it doubled in a year like that
sw4350A-ms98-a-0057 274.070250 286.016250 and so this this is that year that was four hundred i just wasn't prepared to pay for it i'm not too sure what i'm gonna do about that right now there's still another six months to go and it's not a pleasant feeling worrying about that
sw4350A-ms98-a-0058 286.016250 292.979375 [silence]
sw4350A-ms98-a-0059 292.979375 294.754500 hm
sw4350A-ms98-a-0060 294.754500 296.383250 [silence]
sw4350A-ms98-a-0061 296.383250 298.562000 is there any deductible with that or anything like
