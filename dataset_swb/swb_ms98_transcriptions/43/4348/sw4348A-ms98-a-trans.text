sw4348A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.274250 [noise]
sw4348A-ms98-a-0002 0.274250 5.146875 so it's kind of an obsolete [laughter-question] at this point since there isn't a Soviet Union anymore but
sw4348A-ms98-a-0003 5.146875 8.116250 [silence]
sw4348A-ms98-a-0004 8.116250 16.765125 for former right right w[e]- we can say the the the the soon to be former uh Commonwealth of Independent States instead is that
sw4348A-ms98-a-0005 16.765125 18.134625 and
sw4348A-ms98-a-0006 18.134625 23.251625 [silence]
sw4348A-ms98-a-0007 23.251625 32.030375 i- i don't consider them_1 so much to be a threat anymore in terms of them using it is that we're already starting to see demonstrated that in a very cash starved country
sw4348A-ms98-a-0008 32.030375 39.172250 you know those things equal a commodity that can be sold to people who i i worry a lot more [laughter-about] than the Soviet Union
sw4348A-ms98-a-0009 39.172250 40.989000 [silence]
sw4348A-ms98-a-0010 40.989000 49.012000 you know i mean we already had the case where they had those uh guys selling ura[nium]- trying to sell uranium on the open market
sw4348A-ms98-a-0011 49.012000 56.810000 [silence]
sw4348A-ms98-a-0012 56.810000 68.474375 yeah and and in fact i i've been hearing suggestions we set a fund up to get them into alternative areas of research at some reasonable amount of pay so they don't go to Libya or somewhere like that
sw4348A-ms98-a-0013 68.474375 75.273750 [silence]
sw4348A-ms98-a-0014 75.273750 87.187875 right i- i think actually you know the the except for the fact that we happen to be due west of them and we got a fallout cloud i don't think the the the probability that we're gonna be involved in the first strike or anything is fair[ly]- is fairly high
sw4348A-ms98-a-0015 87.187875 91.789500 but you know there's certainly a lot of people arguing there right now [laughter-who] [laughter-all] have nuclear weapons
sw4348A-ms98-a-0016 91.789500 98.610625 and there is also the concern that some of the sovereign uh republics who are a lot of them Islamic
sw4348A-ms98-a-0017 98.610625 111.437750 some of them have nuclear weapons based in them and if they break off and [vocalized-noise] for instance decide to align with Iran or Iraq then suddenly we're in a very difficult position
sw4348A-ms98-a-0018 111.437750 118.284750 [silence]
sw4348A-ms98-a-0019 118.284750 119.697875 um
sw4348A-ms98-a-0020 119.697875 122.470250 [silence]
sw4348A-ms98-a-0021 122.470250 123.788000 yeah
sw4348A-ms98-a-0022 123.788000 135.169750 [silence]
sw4348A-ms98-a-0023 135.169750 139.974125 right and and the of course the other thing is you've got them all arguing over their nuclear subs and
sw4348A-ms98-a-0024 139.974125 153.282750 all of that so there's the whole question whether one of the [vocalized-noise] uh sub drivers is gonna decide to become free lance oh i don't wanna i don't wanna go with Russia so i'm going to uh you know sell myself to the highest bidder or something
sw4348A-ms98-a-0025 153.282750 158.097250 [silence]
sw4348A-ms98-a-0026 158.097250 159.659000 right
sw4348A-ms98-a-0027 159.659000 165.946375 [silence]
sw4348A-ms98-a-0028 165.946375 172.233875 right you know the o[ther]- the other possible scenario of course is that in in i[t's]- it's gonna be hard for the entire
sw4348A-ms98-a-0029 172.233875 182.713125 area to have them_1 but for instance you can see in Russia especially now there's a lot of hard liners coming back because_1 th[e]- the economic reforms aren't working we could find ourselves right back in the same position again
sw4348A-ms98-a-0030 182.713125 196.304875 the only thing i think what we have got going for us is we have a very large stick in the form of economic aid and technological aid and a lot of the Republic seem to be more interested in getting the aid in than having the nuclear weapons
sw4348A-ms98-a-0031 196.304875 202.854875 [silence]
sw4348A-ms98-a-0032 202.854875 204.129250 yeah
sw4348A-ms98-a-0033 204.129250 207.779000 [silence]
sw4348A-ms98-a-0034 207.779000 217.937500 yeah but i i have to say i think all o[verall]- overall things are in instead of the unstability in the area are actually sta[ble]- more stable than they were before because 
sw4348A-ms98-a-0035 217.937500 229.651500 i think inherently our the the chance that we're gonna be involved in it in anything is fairly low i think none of them are foolish enough to wanna attack the United States
sw4348A-ms98-a-0036 229.651500 231.650625 [silence]
sw4348A-ms98-a-0037 231.650625 243.980750 yeah i mean all of them are looking to us from help not for uh not looking to us for you know uh invasion at this point
sw4348A-ms98-a-0038 243.980750 260.952625 [silence]
sw4348A-ms98-a-0039 260.952625 268.262875 um-hum so you know i- i think it it's more gonna be i don't think we're looking at [vocalized-noise] uh potential for anything large scale
sw4348A-ms98-a-0040 268.262875 278.507500 um you know i think there's certainly some people in in the US government who would like us to think that they're still a threat um you know i was listening to MPR yesterday talk about the Sea Hawk submarine
sw4348A-ms98-a-0041 278.507500 289.341500 and you know i'm saying you know wait a minute here why do we wanna build like two or three multibillion dollar submarines you know and the reason is to keep Gratin Connecticut at all alive but
sw4348A-ms98-a-0042 289.341500 298.562000 yeah i- i think that there's there are people in government who perc[eive]- who would whose job it is to make sure that we still perceive a threat where there may not be one anymore
