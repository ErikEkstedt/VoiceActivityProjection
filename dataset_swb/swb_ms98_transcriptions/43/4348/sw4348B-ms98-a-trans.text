sw4348B-ms98-a-0003 4.478375 8.776750 right i mean yeah first of all i think that we have to agree that former Soviet Union
sw4348B-ms98-a-0004 8.776750 15.216125 [silence]
sw4348B-ms98-a-0005 15.216125 23.994375 that that's true too on that one well i- i- i personally still view them to be a threat as long as they've got nuclear weapons and or other weapons that can hit us
sw4348B-ms98-a-0006 23.994375 38.243875 [silence]
sw4348B-ms98-a-0007 38.243875 42.510250 tha[t]- that that's very true i- i would agree with that also or
sw4348B-ms98-a-0008 42.510250 47.953375 [silence]
sw4348B-ms98-a-0009 47.953375 58.976500 that that part is very true there's also the uh the problem of you know the scientist that will you know need money also and and they can be very rich by
sw4348B-ms98-a-0010 58.976500 67.585500 [silence]
sw4348B-ms98-a-0011 67.585500 76.299250 sure so i mean yeah so i i- i think there's still a lot of threats there i'm not sure if you can once again like you said it's kind of obsolete is it the Soviet Union that's threatening us though
sw4348B-ms98-a-0012 76.299250 81.149375 [silence]
sw4348B-ms98-a-0013 81.149375 82.797125 [noise]
sw4348B-ms98-a-0014 82.797125 110.676125 [silence]
sw4348B-ms98-a-0015 110.676125 119.489250 sure a[nother]- another problem that would worry me somewhat uh would be that say they were using nuclear weapons on themselves you know in another area
sw4348B-ms98-a-0016 119.489250 123.081750 since since there are is some you know disagreements between the different Commonwealths
sw4348B-ms98-a-0017 123.081750 130.572125 uh you know some very different etiologies in there also it if they were to use them there what would all of our audit detection and what not [laughter-type]
sw4348B-ms98-a-0018 130.572125 135.919500 systems i mean what what's the chance for an accident in that case also on top of the fallout factor
sw4348B-ms98-a-0019 135.919500 146.047375 [silence]
sw4348B-ms98-a-0020 146.047375 147.242750 right
sw4348B-ms98-a-0021 147.242750 152.523375 [silence]
sw4348B-ms98-a-0022 152.523375 158.270250 absolutely so yeah that that that whole thing is a very scary thing [destabulation/destabilization] de[stabilization]- destabilization
sw4348B-ms98-a-0023 158.270250 164.099125 and let it let it choke on that one uh the [laughter-uh] you know the Soviet Union has been a uh
sw4348B-ms98-a-0024 164.099125 166.742375 a big concern it's a scary thing
sw4348B-ms98-a-0025 166.742375 182.494125 [silence]
sw4348B-ms98-a-0026 182.494125 183.889250 sure
sw4348B-ms98-a-0027 183.889250 194.963000 [silence]
sw4348B-ms98-a-0028 194.963000 203.437250 tha[t]- tha[t]- that's very true um you know granted that you know The Cold War was a very scary thing but at least it was a non commodity
sw4348B-ms98-a-0029 203.437250 208.834500 you know we we knew what we we're you know we knew what we were up against
sw4348B-ms98-a-0030 208.834500 228.851000 [silence]
sw4348B-ms98-a-0031 228.851000 232.457500 well especially_1 now that they're divided they're not bigger than we are anymore
sw4348B-ms98-a-0032 232.457500 241.945625 [silence]
sw4348B-ms98-a-0033 241.945625 252.167125 yeah i- i think it is very true uh you know we're once again even the even the ones that aren't necessarily looking for help from us you know they getting massive amounts of help or or wanting that from Germany and
sw4348B-ms98-a-0034 252.167125 262.017375 from other from other third world countries so that would that would probably also keep you know blatant uh uh you know acts of war out of the uh picture
sw4348B-ms98-a-0035 262.017375 297.469125 [silence]
sw4348B-ms98-a-0036 297.469125 298.562000 sure
