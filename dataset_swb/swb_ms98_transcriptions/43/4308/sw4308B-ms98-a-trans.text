sw4308B-ms98-a-0011 64.135000 70.790625 yeah i i did uh i'm it's it's if it isn't one home project it's another
sw4308B-ms98-a-0012 70.790625 81.499750 and my last major home project was a a a screen porch on the backyard or in the on the back in the yeah in the backyard and uh
sw4308B-ms98-a-0013 81.499750 82.918500 [noise]
sw4308B-ms98-a-0014 82.918500 86.238750 well when they delivered all the parts [laughter]
sw4308B-ms98-a-0015 86.238750 94.165375 i joked about the bag of screws of six million screws well there were six million screws
sw4308B-ms98-a-0016 94.165375 95.571750 [noise]
sw4308B-ms98-a-0017 95.571750 101.845250 and i went through more tools because_1 it um i was using a power screwdriver
sw4308B-ms98-a-0018 101.845250 107.175125 and it or or or a screw driver a[ttachment]- attachment in a a power drill
sw4308B-ms98-a-0019 107.175125 112.910375 and the the attachment i kept on stripping the the ratchet uh head
sw4308B-ms98-a-0020 112.910375 120.240000 because they weren't design for um being um having any torque put on them from a sc[rew]- power power drill
sw4308B-ms98-a-0021 120.240000 125.193625 and so i'd have to stop in the middle of what i was doing and run up to Home Depot
sw4308B-ms98-a-0022 125.193625 130.232000 which incidentally is less than a thousand feet from my house
sw4308B-ms98-a-0023 130.232000 132.830375 [laughter] but um
sw4308B-ms98-a-0024 132.830375 137.570875 i had to run up to Home Depot get the part and work on it some more
sw4308B-ms98-a-0025 137.570875 141.612875 and then i'd realize i was missing another tool
sw4308B-ms98-a-0026 141.612875 147.260250 and run up to it and it went like this for a couple of weekends while i put this thing together
sw4308B-ms98-a-0027 147.260250 150.887250 but um it was
sw4308B-ms98-a-0028 150.887250 156.623250 that one wasn't so bad as much as tiling the floor of the bathroom where
sw4308B-ms98-a-0029 156.623250 166.915500 um i wiped out the bathroom i thought oh i can do this is a week and i got everything here i got all the tools and no sweat two months later i had it done

sw4308B-ms98-a-0034 183.227125 186.212375 things in their directions
sw4308B-ms98-a-0035 186.212375 190.171750 [silence]
sw4308B-ms98-a-0036 190.171750 196.403375 yes and it oh th[is]- this is obvious no it's not obvious you've got to tell us [laughter-that]

sw4308B-ms98-a-0041 224.942000 229.029875 yeah i i i find it enjoyable uh
sw4308B-ms98-a-0042 229.029875 238.313875 and it's not difficult difficultly uh not really difficult it's just the right tools make all the difference in the world
sw4308B-ms98-a-0043 238.313875 240.677125 [silence]
sw4308B-ms98-a-0044 240.677125 244.900375 uh no each project i might buy one new tool
sw4308B-ms98-a-0045 244.900375 250.338500 but as far as i- i don't count screw drivers as new tools i mean a new power tool
sw4308B-ms98-a-0046 250.338500 255.123625 uh but i might like the last time i put up a new range hood in the kitchen
sw4308B-ms98-a-0047 255.123625 262.178125 and i got tired of the old one the old one had this the blade that you could watch it go around when it was on high
sw4308B-ms98-a-0048 262.178125 270.071500 it was so slow and i said wait a minute this this isn't doing anything it's it's pushing the smoke back into the room
sw4308B-ms98-a-0049 270.071500 281.214125 so i went up to the store and i found the one that had the forty horsepower motor attached to the fan that when i flipped it on it started to rip the tiles off the floor
sw4308B-ms98-a-0050 281.214125 286.728875 and i said yeah that's the one i want that that way i'll make sure the smoke alarm doesn't go off
sw4308B-ms98-a-0051 286.728875 292.513500 and so when i p[ut]- started putting that one in i bought a um cordless screwdriver
sw4308B-ms98-a-0052 292.513500 294.629000 that was the last power tool i bought
sw4308B-ms98-a-0053 294.629000 298.626000 [silence]
