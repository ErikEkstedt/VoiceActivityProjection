sw4313A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.630625 [noise] well i guess uh
sw4313A-ms98-a-0002 1.630625 2.674875 [silence]
sw4313A-ms98-a-0003 2.674875 7.973625 start off by saying that i am very much in favor of space travel but i think we're going about it all wrong
sw4313A-ms98-a-0004 7.973625 9.805500 what are your thoughts
sw4313A-ms98-a-0005 9.805500 27.905500 [silence]
sw4313A-ms98-a-0006 27.905500 29.502625 um
sw4313A-ms98-a-0007 29.502625 30.674250 yeah
sw4313A-ms98-a-0008 30.674250 36.104375 well i am uh kind of disappointed by the way things have been going
sw4313A-ms98-a-0009 36.104375 41.404125 uh basically we've been out this at this for what about thirty five years
sw4313A-ms98-a-0010 41.404125 43.737000 from the first experimental
sw4313A-ms98-a-0011 43.737000 49.908500 well first experimental vanguard type stuff uh i think that was called the first uh the modified B twos and things like that
sw4313A-ms98-a-0012 49.908500 52.209875 that was late fifties i believe so
sw4313A-ms98-a-0013 52.209875 55.094875 and um if you
sw4313A-ms98-a-0014 55.094875 61.800125 look at the progress that was made at the turn of the century in aviation in a period of thirty five years
sw4313A-ms98-a-0015 61.800125 65.349125 in my assessment it was spectacularly better
sw4313A-ms98-a-0016 65.349125 66.514625 [silence]
sw4313A-ms98-a-0017 66.514625 73.907875 and um i don't think that's because the complexity of the task i think that's because it's being handled by bureaucracy now
sw4313A-ms98-a-0018 73.907875 83.249625 [silence]
sw4313A-ms98-a-0019 83.249625 92.619125 well i'm excited about these fellows who are experimenting commercially i'm excited about uh the commercial end of satellite operations
sw4313A-ms98-a-0020 92.619125 97.702750 um there seems to be some spectacular progress happening there and uh
sw4313A-ms98-a-0021 97.702750 108.032375 [silence]
sw4313A-ms98-a-0022 108.032375 112.850125 well what would be what would be the reasons for prohibiting commercial research
sw4313A-ms98-a-0023 112.850125 128.595375 [silence]
sw4313A-ms98-a-0024 128.595375 134.258375 well they have some organizations out there with some fairly deep pockets and uh i think that
sw4313A-ms98-a-0025 134.258375 137.693250 [silence]
sw4313A-ms98-a-0026 137.693250 139.248625 yeah well maybe
sw4313A-ms98-a-0027 139.248625 159.331125 [silence]
sw4313A-ms98-a-0028 159.331125 161.466250 well you go ahead
sw4313A-ms98-a-0029 161.466250 174.728500 [silence]
sw4313A-ms98-a-0030 174.728500 175.956250 um
sw4313A-ms98-a-0031 175.956250 185.705375 [silence]
sw4313A-ms98-a-0032 185.705375 187.032375 um
sw4313A-ms98-a-0033 187.032375 188.280000 [silence]
sw4313A-ms98-a-0034 188.280000 189.541125 go ahead
sw4313A-ms98-a-0035 189.541125 197.223250 [silence]
sw4313A-ms98-a-0036 197.223250 198.460875 um-hum
sw4313A-ms98-a-0037 198.460875 204.853000 [silence]
sw4313A-ms98-a-0038 204.853000 206.466500 well
sw4313A-ms98-a-0039 206.466500 217.125375 [silence]
sw4313A-ms98-a-0040 217.125375 218.318500 [laughter]
sw4313A-ms98-a-0041 218.318500 220.333125 it's not as effective now as it was [laughter-then]
sw4313A-ms98-a-0042 220.333125 221.939125 [laughter]
sw4313A-ms98-a-0043 221.939125 229.740000 [silence]
sw4313A-ms98-a-0044 229.740000 231.446750 it may be obsolete
sw4313A-ms98-a-0045 231.446750 235.609625 yeah yeah you know i uh what do you call it um
sw4313A-ms98-a-0046 235.609625 239.461750 i think it's important that it happened i think that ultimately it will happen
sw4313A-ms98-a-0047 239.461750 244.509750 um i think that the way things are going on now may be an impediment and th[at]- by that i mean [vocalized-noise]
sw4313A-ms98-a-0048 244.509750 251.807000 you know i don't know about i'm not going to speculate about research across the board but let's suppose um you were the executive of a company that could possibly have benefit from some space research
sw4313A-ms98-a-0049 251.807000 255.296875 and you're three or four competitors and you're debating whether to um
sw4313A-ms98-a-0050 255.296875 258.515750 throw a couple of billion dollars into it over the next twenty years
sw4313A-ms98-a-0051 258.515750 262.038500 but it's going to be a real long term uh play
sw4313A-ms98-a-0052 262.038500 265.897625 or whether you're just going to sit back and watch television and um
sw4313A-ms98-a-0053 265.897625 274.451875 when you look when you see that your primary competitor is um a government with very deep pockets that's going to give the fruits to your competitors
sw4313A-ms98-a-0054 274.451875 280.347500 the obvious correct decision is to sit back and wait for them to give it to everybody rather than doing it yourself
sw4313A-ms98-a-0055 280.347500 287.070625 so i think the government getting involved in that tends to reduce the amount of uh private uh effort put into it
sw4313A-ms98-a-0056 287.070625 296.428125 uh with regard to myself personally i think that if ever if i ever in my lifetime do stand on the surface of the moon it's going to be uh on a ship with a Japanese flag
sw4313A-ms98-a-0057 296.428125 299.522000 [silence]
