sw4313B-ms98-a-0003 7.478625 8.963375 okay with that
sw4313B-ms98-a-0004 8.963375 10.445125 [laughter]
sw4313B-ms98-a-0005 10.445125 18.169500 uh i'd like you to expound on that a little bit but uh i am very much in favor of it too and i think that we need to take the approach that
sw4313B-ms98-a-0006 18.169500 26.667625 so much technology is advanced out of the uh space program that it's amazing to me that we don't
sw4313B-ms98-a-0007 26.667625 28.605125 put more money into it
sw4313B-ms98-a-0008 28.605125 30.155000 [laughter]
sw4313B-ms98-a-0009 30.155000 40.941875 [silence]
sw4313B-ms98-a-0010 40.941875 45.705750 uh well yeah well it depends on what you're say[ing]- yeah that i guess
sw4313B-ms98-a-0011 45.705750 47.344250 um-hum
sw4313B-ms98-a-0012 47.344250 49.155750 [silence]
sw4313B-ms98-a-0013 49.155750 51.107500 [noise] okay
sw4313B-ms98-a-0014 51.107500 52.656750 yeah
sw4313B-ms98-a-0015 52.656750 59.349375 [silence]
sw4313B-ms98-a-0016 59.349375 60.732250 um-hum
sw4313B-ms98-a-0017 60.732250 65.162750 [silence]
sw4313B-ms98-a-0018 65.162750 67.422000 well there's no doubt about that
sw4313B-ms98-a-0019 67.422000 73.898625 [silence]
sw4313B-ms98-a-0020 73.898625 83.255125 well you so you're saying you thought uh that well that that implies to me that you would you should've felt like it should've been uh turned over to a commercial market
sw4313B-ms98-a-0021 83.255125 96.380875 [silence]
sw4313B-ms98-a-0022 96.380875 102.808625 well i think that uh satellites now that is a that is a market where there's a a valid
sw4313B-ms98-a-0023 102.808625 108.477000 reason for commercial uh when it comes to research i'm not sure i agree with that
sw4313B-ms98-a-0024 108.477000 111.970625 [silence]
sw4313B-ms98-a-0025 111.970625 121.677125 oh no reasons i just don't think that uh a commercial organization could successfully uh uh make it profitable for them
sw4313B-ms98-a-0026 121.677125 129.051625 uh i mean [noise] and besides the fact it it also would be extremely limiting as to which research it'd be be whichever one happened to bring in the dollar
sw4313B-ms98-a-0027 129.051625 133.150625 [silence]
sw4313B-ms98-a-0028 133.150625 137.642500 but US is notorious for not spending any money on research
sw4313B-ms98-a-0029 137.642500 152.599375 uh our commercial mark[et]- uh our commercial percentages are much lower than uh mos[t]- most of the other major countries as compared to Japan compared to Germany compared to uh most of the Scandinavian countries
sw4313B-ms98-a-0030 152.599375 162.617750 the amount of money uh put towards research is is minuscule and had minuscule and has been decreasing over the last few years th[at]- so i'm not so sure that that would be
sw4313B-ms98-a-0031 162.617750 175.244000 i- i- i agree that the bureaucracy in most cases is something [laughter-which] it should be avoided and we have we have entirely too much government and bureaucracy and it and it seeps over in a lot of different ways
sw4313B-ms98-a-0032 175.244000 187.590125 now uh in space i don't think you could do it any other way uh w[ell]- i'd say fact my opinion is what we ought to do is we ought to get all these all the countries involved in these things and in fact
sw4313B-ms98-a-0033 187.590125 189.094875 [silence]
sw4313B-ms98-a-0034 189.094875 198.226500 oh well be[cause]- i mean we have um resources across the world i mean i- i we're coming out to a global global economy anyways
sw4313B-ms98-a-0035 198.226500 205.900250 so why aren't we using the Japanese technology why aren't we using the European technology why aren't see
sw4313B-ms98-a-0036 205.900250 219.521250 see space travel is a world issue it's not a US issue and and our our our kind of elitism attitude we had in the sixties about US uh love it or leave it [vocalized-noise] and you know actually we still have it but that whole
sw4313B-ms98-a-0037 219.521250 230.733625 right um that th[e]- th[e]- the concept of beating the other uh countries i think is somewhat
sw4313B-ms98-a-0038 230.733625 233.594125 yeah it's somewhat obsolete [laughter] and i think
sw4313B-ms98-a-0039 233.594125 251.094375 [silence]
sw4313B-ms98-a-0040 251.094375 252.508625 right
sw4313B-ms98-a-0041 252.508625 257.728625 [silence]
sw4313B-ms98-a-0042 257.728625 259.105625 um-hum
sw4313B-ms98-a-0043 259.105625 296.851000 [silence]
sw4313B-ms98-a-0044 296.851000 299.522000 [laughter] i would say that i have absolutely no
