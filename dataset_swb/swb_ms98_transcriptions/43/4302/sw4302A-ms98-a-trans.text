sw4302A-ms98-a-0005 5.652750 7.600875 okay um
sw4302A-ms98-a-0006 7.600875 8.447875 [silence] 
sw4302A-ms98-a-0007 8.447875 10.650125 i guess i um
sw4302A-ms98-a-0008 10.650125 13.707875 haven't really thought about it for a while i guess um
sw4302A-ms98-a-0009 13.707875 17.789625 the uh job part of the one i have now there is a
sw4302A-ms98-a-0010 17.789625 25.958125 requirement that kind of came in after the fact that does since they have contracts one of their uh companies they contract with required it and uh
sw4302A-ms98-a-0011 25.958125 31.161625 you know by then it was it was kind of uh um
sw4302A-ms98-a-0012 31.161625 39.398750 you know they didn't explain up front that that might be a requirement but it sounded like it was kind of sprung on them by the uh firms they had contracts with
sw4302A-ms98-a-0013 39.398750 43.215625 uh but it's it's not something i
sw4302A-ms98-a-0014 43.215625 51.225500 think is appropriate i guess there might be exceptions you know if if you're in a critical position like you're a traffic controller or something like that
sw4302A-ms98-a-0015 51.225500 53.941250 but um it should
sw4302A-ms98-a-0016 53.941250 56.400125 i[t]- it seems like uh
sw4302A-ms98-a-0017 56.400125 57.724375 [silence]
sw4302A-ms98-a-0018 57.724375 60.515625 i guess the employer uh
sw4302A-ms98-a-0019 60.515625 61.811750 is just
sw4302A-ms98-a-0020 61.811750 65.681875 i think a massing too much information there's it's just an intrusion into
sw4302A-ms98-a-0021 65.681875 67.342875 [silence]
sw4302A-ms98-a-0022 67.342875 69.351000 uh kind of your personal life

sw4302A-ms98-a-0056 226.940625 232.403000 yeah [noise] seems like it's a sneaky way to introduce it because eventually you know then everybody would
sw4302A-ms98-a-0057 232.403000 234.287125 done it and they they
sw4302A-ms98-a-0058 234.287125 236.552625 you know the climate would be different then
sw4302A-ms98-a-0059 236.552625 251.761875 [silence]
sw4302A-ms98-a-0060 251.761875 252.955375 uh-huh

sw4302A-ms98-a-0067 277.742250 282.345750 yeah it just seems like it's a intrusion i mean the the only angle they might have is if um
sw4302A-ms98-a-0068 282.345750 283.638625 [silence]
sw4302A-ms98-a-0069 283.638625 288.233375 i guess if they're paying the insurance premium or something like that then it you know
sw4302A-ms98-a-0070 288.233375 291.517250 it might be that they the carr[ier]- the carrier they're using has a
sw4302A-ms98-a-0071 291.517250 296.198500 has higher rates or something like that so there's there's probably an economic argument
sw4302A-ms98-a-0072 296.198500 297.444250 [vocalized-noise]
