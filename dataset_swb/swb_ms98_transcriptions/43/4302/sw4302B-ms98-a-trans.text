sw4302B-ms98-a-0003 2.316250 3.828125 okay
sw4302B-ms98-a-0004 3.828125 6.905000 so uh you go first yeah 
sw4302B-ms98-a-0005 6.905000 38.806500 [silence]
sw4302B-ms98-a-0006 38.806500 40.309625 uh-huh
sw4302B-ms98-a-0007 40.309625 41.812875 [noise]
sw4302B-ms98-a-0008 41.812875 50.314500 [silence]
sw4302B-ms98-a-0009 50.314500 51.443000 um-hum 
sw4302B-ms98-a-0010 51.443000 68.636375 [silence]
sw4302B-ms98-a-0011 68.636375 84.528875 right yeah that that that's how i feel i feel the um the employee um the employer has concern about you know what's going on in my body to the degree that it affects how i am doing my job and 
sw4302B-ms98-a-0012 84.528875 94.525125 um there are lots of factors that affect how i do my job i i don't personally take any drugs but you know that's one factor that could affect some[thing]- an employee's performance 
sw4302B-ms98-a-0013 94.525125 102.990625 there are plenty of other factors like i know for me how much sleep i got you know what i ate for breakfast those things have a lot big impact on how i perform during the day
sw4302B-ms98-a-0014 102.990625 107.459000 and unless they're they want to get involved in all these other areas also
sw4302B-ms98-a-0015 107.459000 113.567500 you know like maybe providing healthy meals healthy breakfast for employees or something like that you know i me[an]- i i
sw4302B-ms98-a-0016 113.567500 121.640500 uh that's you know that's one step and it what it is what they're getting into is the drug testing is a real quick and easy way and politically
sw4302B-ms98-a-0017 121.640500 131.255750 um feasible way of going about this because you know everybody is going to be against drugs you know well just about everybody is against drug use so let's test everybody for it
sw4302B-ms98-a-0018 131.255750 139.388625 but the thing is it's not it's not my company's business what i do on the weekends or in in the evenings you know if i show up for work hungover
sw4302B-ms98-a-0019 139.388625 147.435125 then they've got something to say you know so hungover to the extent that i'm not able to do my job well
sw4302B-ms98-a-0020 147.435125 148.878000 [silence]
sw4302B-ms98-a-0021 148.878000 156.647250 yeah yeah but on the other hand if i go out and have fifteen thousand beers but then i'm fine the next morning
sw4302B-ms98-a-0022 156.647250 158.398750 it's none of their business
sw4302B-ms98-a-0023 158.398750 165.665500 you know what i do with myself or if if i smoke fifteen joints or something and i hit or whatever um
sw4302B-ms98-a-0024 165.665500 177.973875 and that's how i feel about it uh things drug testing for uh marijuana i guess can detect use uh or actually they can do tests with um with hair samples of hair and finger nails
sw4302B-ms98-a-0025 177.973875 183.118000 that can test or detect use like months and months and months previous
sw4302B-ms98-a-0026 183.118000 195.760375 you know and so it's obviously that there's not you could've decided okay i'm going to stop now and may have stopped for three months and still it would show up in these tests and that's completely unfair
sw4302B-ms98-a-0027 195.760375 196.744000 um 
sw4302B-ms98-a-0028 196.744000 205.551000 also especially it's unfair when the companies don't offer some sort of treatment program also it you know it's like oh we find you with drugs so huh you're gone 
sw4302B-ms98-a-0029 205.551000 207.115000 get out of here
sw4302B-ms98-a-0030 207.115000 220.792750 um luckily my company is doesn't uh do any of that sort of thing they they were talking about doing the policy of testing new people new employees as they come in but not anything i[t]- it wouldn't be random it would be everybody um
sw4302B-ms98-a-0031 220.792750 225.512000 and it wouldn't be current employees it would only be new employees um
sw4302B-ms98-a-0032 225.512000 227.402250 but i you know i
sw4302B-ms98-a-0033 227.402250 229.802375 [silence]
sw4302B-ms98-a-0034 229.802375 231.995750 yeah yeah 
sw4302B-ms98-a-0035 231.995750 233.500125 [silence]
sw4302B-ms98-a-0036 233.500125 235.746000 right yeah it it'll be
sw4302B-ms98-a-0037 235.746000 236.967625 yeah
sw4302B-ms98-a-0038 236.967625 240.141750 and i i you know i don't think the companies have any
sw4302B-ms98-a-0039 240.141750 242.837125 cause to do that sort of thing
sw4302B-ms98-a-0040 242.837125 247.448250 unless there's you know reasonable suspicion you know if you come in
sw4302B-ms98-a-0041 247.448250 253.752625 obvious glassy eyed everyday from lunch or something it's okay somebody's been smoking some pot here
sw4302B-ms98-a-0042 253.752625 258.864625 then do a drug test if you have some reasonable suspicion but it's
sw4302B-ms98-a-0043 258.864625 268.067375 you know th[ere]- th[ere]- there's so many things i mean if if i were going through a divorce for instance which is something a lot of people experience that would really negatively affect my performance
sw4302B-ms98-a-0044 268.067375 276.853250 you know are they going to require that i stay married or that i require me to some how have a perfect marriage or something well then you know that doesn't make sense
sw4302B-ms98-a-0045 276.853250 279.311625 so it's
sw4302B-ms98-a-0046 279.311625 280.827250 yeah
sw4302B-ms98-a-0047 280.827250 287.687625 [silence]
sw4302B-ms98-a-0048 287.687625 290.280875 uh-huh uh-huh 
sw4302B-ms98-a-0049 290.280875 293.345625 [silence]
sw4302B-ms98-a-0050 293.345625 295.316625 right well
sw4302B-ms98-a-0051 295.316625 298.690000 i[n]- i[n]- i[n]- in that case charge the employees extra
