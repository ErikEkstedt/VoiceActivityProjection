sw4331A-ms98-a-0004 16.041500 34.998750 [silence]
sw4331A-ms98-a-0005 34.998750 36.180000 [laughter]

sw4331A-ms98-a-0013 75.601625 79.052500 that's true well certainly Texas uh
sw4331A-ms98-a-0014 79.052500 86.574000 as a state believes in capital punishment i don't know i wonder if we execute more people than other states or
sw4331A-ms98-a-0015 86.574000 124.083250 [silence]
sw4331A-ms98-a-0016 124.083250 127.393125 yeah i think so too uh

sw4331A-ms98-a-0018 132.569500 140.375500 and i- i don't know i wonder if there are other crimes uh a repeated rapist for example or
sw4331A-ms98-a-0019 140.375500 141.510500 [noise]
sw4331A-ms98-a-0020 141.510500 145.625750 uh i don't know kidnapping of course is a
sw4331A-ms98-a-0021 145.625750 147.533000 capital crime
sw4331A-ms98-a-0022 147.533000 148.812000 but i
