sw4331B-ms98-a-0002 3.094625 6.073500 i am i yes and uh
sw4331B-ms98-a-0003 6.073500 7.088125 [silence]
sw4331B-ms98-a-0004 7.088125 12.232750 uh what was the first part of the uh subject that you [vocalized-noise]
sw4331B-ms98-a-0005 12.232750 14.983375 [silence]
sw4331B-ms98-a-0006 14.983375 19.182750 oh i- i basically do i think uh
sw4331B-ms98-a-0007 19.182750 28.779500 other than murder uh the probably uh i don't think there's a need for it if uh if it's not if the case is doesn't involve murder
sw4331B-ms98-a-0008 28.779500 33.245625 i don't see any need for it in anything else any other circumstances
sw4331B-ms98-a-0009 33.245625 36.231750 i guess it's an eye for an eye
sw4331B-ms98-a-0010 36.231750 40.825625 [silence]
sw4331B-ms98-a-0011 40.825625 42.180250 oh
sw4331B-ms98-a-0012 42.180250 43.780625 yeah
sw4331B-ms98-a-0013 43.780625 49.892500 well yeah i guess the other argument is that you might execute the wrong person but uh
sw4331B-ms98-a-0014 49.892500 59.552000 i don't know i just think the chances of that happening are pretty slim of course it's [laughter] it's not reversible uh obviously but uh i just think the way the system is set up uh
sw4331B-ms98-a-0015 59.552000 66.346875 the chances of the wrong person being executed are are really very small uh
sw4331B-ms98-a-0016 66.346875 75.849000 uh i've served on a few juries and they take a they seem to take a lot of care to make sure they've got the uh the right person whatever for the conviction levied
sw4331B-ms98-a-0017 75.849000 78.270750 [silence]

sw4331B-ms98-a-0022 86.298000 96.184625 i don't know you every once in a while if you hear [vocalized-noise] if there's some who's fairly famous or notorious being executed in another state you read about it or hear about it but uh
sw4331B-ms98-a-0023 96.184625 109.085250 i don't know how we rank up there with the other states but uh i think it's a deterrent i- i don't i mean it wouldn't be a deterrent for everybody obviously but i think uh if it uh
sw4331B-ms98-a-0024 109.085250 122.849000 if it saves one person's life it may be worth it uh if one person who was going to kill somebody thought otherwise because of the uh possibility or a possibility of capital punishment it uh it may be worth it
sw4331B-ms98-a-0025 122.849000 124.517500 but i think it's a deterrent
sw4331B-ms98-a-0026 124.517500 125.680625 [silence]
sw4331B-ms98-a-0027 125.680625 126.843750 [noise]

sw4331B-ms98-a-0032 138.121375 139.614750 yeah
sw4331B-ms98-a-0033 139.614750 147.776625 [silence]
sw4331B-ms98-a-0034 147.776625 149.141125 w[ell]-
sw4331B-ms98-a-0035 149.141125 155.519125 is that uh is that punishable by death in Texas or is that up to the jury to decide or the judge
sw4331B-ms98-a-0036 155.519125 160.230750 i never thought about that but is that is that a capital crime
sw4331B-ms98-a-0037 160.230750 161.396625 huh
sw4331B-ms98-a-0038 161.396625 163.538000 [silence]
sw4331B-ms98-a-0039 163.538000 165.343125 [laughter]
sw4331B-ms98-a-0040 165.343125 171.517250 don't hear much about don't hear much about kidnapping anymore kidnaps uh
sw4331B-ms98-a-0041 171.517250 174.917750 [silence]
sw4331B-ms98-a-0042 174.917750 187.626750 but the uh the whole judicial system is a mess like you said there's no rehabilitation in the prisons and so they get out of prison and they're they're back to doing what they were doing before they went to prison
sw4331B-ms98-a-0043 187.626750 189.438000 they haven't learned a lesson
sw4331B-ms98-a-0044 189.438000 195.263250 [silence]
sw4331B-ms98-a-0045 195.263250 197.734125 um-hum yeah
sw4331B-ms98-a-0046 197.734125 208.994625 yeah well like you said rape uh that there's a possibility there for uh capital punishment and that that's a serious enough crime that uh it maybe warrant capital punishment
sw4331B-ms98-a-0047 208.994625 217.843500 but what gets me is the uh i may be getting off the subject somebody might get forty five years for stealing i mean for robbing something
sw4331B-ms98-a-0048 217.843500 224.506875 of course that i think to get that they'd have to be a repeat offender that'd be more than one or two cases involved
sw4331B-ms98-a-0049 224.506875 230.166250 but the the whole judicial system seems to be lopsided messed up
sw4331B-ms98-a-0050 230.166250 234.621875 [silence]
sw4331B-ms98-a-0051 234.621875 238.492000 no no i really don't uh 
sw4331B-ms98-a-0052 238.492000 245.290750 no murder and again rape possibly a repeated uh rapist may be uh
sw4331B-ms98-a-0053 245.290750 253.101250 a candidate for capital punishment but uh the really serious stuff i don't this burglary and robbery and
sw4331B-ms98-a-0054 253.101250 261.655125 uh that sort of thing even if they're multiple offenders or repeat offenders i- i wouldn't condone capital punishment for that
sw4331B-ms98-a-0055 261.655125 273.964625 [silence]
sw4331B-ms98-a-0056 273.964625 282.529125 yeah yeah that uh it was it was uh there was no capital punishment for a long time there i don't know fifteen twenty years maybe
sw4331B-ms98-a-0057 282.529125 287.064250 and uh i know when i was growing up there was uh there were a lot of uh
sw4331B-ms98-a-0058 287.064250 297.597500 electrocutions up in Sing Sing up in New York upstate New York and then uh they did away with like you said Supreme Court outlawed it and then it came back on a state by state basis
sw4331B-ms98-a-0059 297.597500 299.714000 but uh
