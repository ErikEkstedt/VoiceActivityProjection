sw4343B-ms98-a-0032 203.166875 212.659625 uh other countries especially European countries they pay a larger percentage than we do but the things that they get in return are more tangible
sw4343B-ms98-a-0033 212.659625 224.029750 to the common person national health care uh education systems that you know that's one of mine own pet peeves is how can how can our teachers be so damn efficient
sw4343B-ms98-a-0034 224.029750 234.565875 that they [laughter-can] teach our students in a hundred and eighty days what it takes Europe two hundred and forty days to teach you know how can they be that good come on [noise] come on

sw4343B-ms98-a-0041 284.176500 296.769375 a hundred eighty billion dollars a year just sort of going out of window and why don't they do anything to stop it well it'd cost a billion dollars to track all the fraud and mismanagement well guess what i think that's a really good return on investment don't you
sw4343B-ms98-a-0042 296.769375 298.786000 a billion versus a hundred and eighty billion
