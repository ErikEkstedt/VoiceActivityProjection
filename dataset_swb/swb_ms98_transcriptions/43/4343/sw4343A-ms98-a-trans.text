sw4343A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 13.768125 [noise] i guess i'll give my opinions here first okay uh in terms of taxes here i guess uh i feel like we are paying an awful lot of them_1 uh and getting apparently very little for it
sw4343A-ms98-a-0002 13.768125 24.386250 uh especially since uh the things that i think that our taxes are going for are i- i guess in my opinion not the uh a[ppropriate]- necessarily appropriate things
sw4343A-ms98-a-0003 24.386250 37.206500 i think that uh uh we should be emphasizing uh things like more like education and less on on programs which are permanent black holes which will never
sw4343A-ms98-a-0004 37.206500 41.741375 do anything but continue to be uh uh
sw4343A-ms98-a-0005 41.741375 43.683375 sponges for money
sw4343A-ms98-a-0006 43.683375 49.002625 i mean we need to do uh programs which are more on the concept of
sw4343A-ms98-a-0007 49.002625 50.727625 uh
sw4343A-ms98-a-0008 50.727625 55.731250 well like one of the concepts they had before was trying to renovate the housing
sw4343A-ms98-a-0009 55.731250 65.037375 but uh then turning the housing over that now see i- i agreed with that one and i'm not very often into those kind of those kind of programs but that one made sense
sw4343A-ms98-a-0010 65.037375 77.219000 help these people to fix their houses to improve their their environment i mean uh uh p[rojects]- projects were the most idiotic concept in the world
sw4343A-ms98-a-0011 77.219000 81.546875 you h[ad]- they had no sense of ownership no sense of responsibility
sw4343A-ms98-a-0012 81.546875 95.615875 i[t]- well it was like it's just a place for you to stay and you had no uh feeling of of responsibility ownership concern uh in fact it was insult[ing]- it was it was almost insulting it was e[mbarrassing]- it was so embarrassing
sw4343A-ms98-a-0013 95.615875 107.165375 that i you know i- i- i- i don't know exactly what the motivations were but basically they were destroyed they were they uh you know people would strew feces across the uh
sw4343A-ms98-a-0014 107.165375 118.345375 uh rooms you know just incredible the abuses that occured it was obviously a failed concept okay [laughter] so yes i think we do have problems with taxes [laughter]

sw4343A-ms98-a-0036 233.269750 238.977875 well i uh the[n]- what it really comes down to the fact that uh uh
sw4343A-ms98-a-0037 238.977875 243.303875 we don't have enough balls to actually make these programs work 
sw4343A-ms98-a-0038 243.303875 251.563500 uh we[ll]- part part of the symp[tom]- symptom of a democratic s[ystem]- system is that it it kind of uh freezes itself up
