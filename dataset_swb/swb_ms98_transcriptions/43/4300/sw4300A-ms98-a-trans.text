sw4300A-ms98-a-0008 29.952250 41.841875 there there where two million call attempts in in an [laughter-hour] to get the tickets so it was like by the time we got through there i mean we had separate seats seats but we lucked out we got a second and a third row seat

sw4300A-ms98-a-0011 51.567875 61.194500 well i mean it it's more my fiance's tastes um i go more into Celtic music um Celtic Celtic folk uh
sw4300A-ms98-a-0012 61.194500 71.322750 well Still I Spin and Silly Wizard uh Fair Port Convention you know kind kind of folk rocky kind of stuff but with a strong Celtic element
sw4300A-ms98-a-0013 71.322750 80.177125 uh also Tanger[ine]- you know all sorts of pseudo new {agey} stuff Tangerine Dream and Micheal Field and and anything semi electronic
sw4300A-ms98-a-0014 80.177125 85.473500 [silence]
sw4300A-ms98-a-0015 85.473500 91.205875 well i i like the harmonies and and and and the sounds of of Celtic music and i like like the uh
sw4300A-ms98-a-0016 91.205875 102.574250 um the uh the the uh i'm trying to remember the name of it Tin Whistle the the the variety of s[ongs]- tone you can get out and i find the singers tend to be better less screaming and more more uh
sw4300A-ms98-a-0017 102.574250 109.824750 melodic and attention to phrasing and and hitting the [laughter-notes] rather than you know just belting them out
sw4300A-ms98-a-0018 109.824750 115.669875 uh s[ound]- you sound like you probably are down in the uh country and western belt [laughter-there]
sw4300A-ms98-a-0019 115.669875 122.499500 [silence]
sw4300A-ms98-a-0020 122.499500 124.080750 oh
sw4300A-ms98-a-0021 124.080750 133.534625 [silence]
sw4300A-ms98-a-0022 133.534625 140.211500 well i i find i prefer Delta Blues to like you know what a lot of people think the Blues are because_1 i find you know kind of the more
sw4300A-ms98-a-0023 140.211500 147.904000 the the more uh conventional as where blues i i find kind of repetitive uh and and {unmelodic}
sw4300A-ms98-a-0024 147.904000 154.501000 [silence]
sw4300A-ms98-a-0025 154.501000 155.793125 um-hum
sw4300A-ms98-a-0026 155.793125 160.579125 [silence]
sw4300A-ms98-a-0027 160.579125 161.830875 um
sw4300A-ms98-a-0028 161.830875 168.825750 [silence]
sw4300A-ms98-a-0029 168.825750 170.396000 um-hum
sw4300A-ms98-a-0030 170.396000 180.142625 yeah well it it's a ver[y]- it's a very minimalist form because you've got duh duh duh duh or something like that you've got a very simple base line with
sw4300A-ms98-a-0031 180.142625 186.515625 right yeah i think i was singing like my dog [vocalized-noise] yeah
sw4300A-ms98-a-0032 186.515625 198.363875 yeah i mean i i think [vocalized-noise] with that the the quality kind of it it's much more based on you know how much the person can impart i mean i've heard some Blues that it's like you [laughter-you] know did not strike me as
sw4300A-ms98-a-0033 198.363875 204.800875 as anything special because it's like yeah okay you know life's been tough to me too and you know there's just so much you can hear of that
sw4300A-ms98-a-0034 204.800875 207.758125 [silence]
sw4300A-ms98-a-0035 207.758125 216.055750 yeah i i mean you know w[ell]- i've heard some Blues i really liked where you know they're imparting more than just you know i'm yet another guy who got treated bad
sw4300A-ms98-a-0036 216.055750 226.823000 trying think where there was something interesting or unique because i think it depends a lot more on the actual message being imparted it it cer[tainly]- it certainly you're not listening to it for its lilting melodies
sw4300A-ms98-a-0037 226.823000 234.717000 [silence]
sw4300A-ms98-a-0038 234.717000 236.102250 well uh
sw4300A-ms98-a-0039 236.102250 248.100625 Jazz is is a much more i i i think you've got to be a much more uh spontaneous person to be playing Jazz you know you've got a long time to think about that next verse in uh Blues
sw4300A-ms98-a-0040 248.100625 252.875375 where as in Jazz you know it it just is is moving and um
sw4300A-ms98-a-0041 252.875375 258.653875 right i mean and you've got to be very i mean in many ways Jazz and Celtic if you ever go to like a [vocalized-noise]
sw4300A-ms98-a-0042 258.653875 263.077875 um it's very much like a a a an extemporaneous or a uh
sw4300A-ms98-a-0043 263.077875 275.939500 uh you know just a a jam session Jazz because you know there may be a basic pattern you know if you're playing a reel or a jig you know that's the basic melody of the jig but people are just going off and doing their own things and these are people who may have never played
sw4300A-ms98-a-0044 275.939500 277.156625 [noise]
sw4300A-ms98-a-0045 277.156625 278.592750 right
sw4300A-ms98-a-0046 278.592750 282.402375 [silence]
sw4300A-ms98-a-0047 282.402375 288.515125 um there is to some extent i mean you know [vocalized-noise] there's the basic tune of the jig or the real
sw4300A-ms98-a-0048 288.515125 299.522000 but you know someone will just come in and you know who's going to who's going to you know take lead on this verse who's going to you know it you know i want to uh there's a group called [vocalized-noise] which is an Irish
