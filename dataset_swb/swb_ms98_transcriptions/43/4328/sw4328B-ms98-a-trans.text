sw4328B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.880375 [noise]
sw4328B-ms98-a-0002 0.880375 51.524000 [silence]
sw4328B-ms98-a-0003 51.524000 52.975625 i would
sw4328B-ms98-a-0004 52.975625 83.366750 [silence]
sw4328B-ms98-a-0005 83.366750 95.881625 well that's makes sense ours seems really crazy because well we've had the places all the shopping centers i mean the local shopping centers where there's a grocery store and
sw4328B-ms98-a-0006 95.881625 105.113500 you know drug store and so on have bins around where you can leave papers or aluminum cans 
sw4328B-ms98-a-0007 105.113500 116.431750 that type of thing for uh oh the Kiwanis or some sort of groups pick them up and make a little money for their causes and those are fairly popular and work fairly well 
sw4328B-ms98-a-0008 116.431750 123.744750 and you can also take your own stuff to a recycling center and you know get the few pennies you get for the papers or cans
sw4328B-ms98-a-0009 123.744750 129.564750 i know some people who do that but to me that too much trouble for the few cents
sw4328B-ms98-a-0010 129.564750 137.073500 the uh so i just drop it off at the local place when i go to the store and let them
sw4328B-ms98-a-0011 137.073500 150.695250 you know some good agency make some money off of it what little they get and uh that works for me but now as i understand it from reading the paper the system seems totally backwards
sw4328B-ms98-a-0012 150.695250 160.647000 uh they are starting a thing where all of our garbage bills are going up like a dollar and a half a month
sw4328B-ms98-a-0013 160.647000 173.433625 and that's because they will give us containers you know certain colors of bins and stuff to put cans and papers and so on in that all makes sense
sw4328B-ms98-a-0014 173.433625 180.736875 but if you don't want to recycle you can say i don't want to recycle and save a dollar and a half a month
sw4328B-ms98-a-0015 180.736875 190.370250 which the theory is that if you don't want to recycle with the city who actually has a private contractor do it
sw4328B-ms98-a-0016 190.370250 200.226375 uh if you don't recycle with the city then you're going to take it yourself and you know make your money off of your paper and cans
sw4328B-ms98-a-0017 200.226375 206.726250 somehow it seems to me like people will just say i don't want to pay the buck and a half and i'll throw it in the garbage
sw4328B-ms98-a-0018 206.726250 208.345000 so
sw4328B-ms98-a-0019 208.345000 209.448000 [silence]
sw4328B-ms98-a-0020 209.448000 212.977625 it sounds to me like it's messed up but they've had
sw4328B-ms98-a-0021 212.977625 214.152875 [silence]
sw4328B-ms98-a-0022 214.152875 226.703750 i guess so we'll have to see what happens they're just supposed to start distributing these blue plastic containers for cans and bottles and different kind different colors for different things
sw4328B-ms98-a-0023 226.703750 228.163000 uh
sw4328B-ms98-a-0024 228.163000 232.597750 [silence]
sw4328B-ms98-a-0025 232.597750 244.234000 you still could so it doesn't make a lot of sense to me and i think i understand it pretty well from both the paper and TV and we'll see what happens
sw4328B-ms98-a-0026 244.234000 245.699750 uh
sw4328B-ms98-a-0027 245.699750 247.326625 [silence]
sw4328B-ms98-a-0028 247.326625 250.427875 oh supposedly the majority are
sw4328B-ms98-a-0029 250.427875 253.703750 it's pretty ecologically conscious here
sw4328B-ms98-a-0030 253.703750 255.262250 [silence]
sw4328B-ms98-a-0031 255.262250 262.137000 oh i think so plus a lot of people will probably just pay the buck and a half and not even notice the difference or care
sw4328B-ms98-a-0032 262.137000 264.074625 but uh
sw4328B-ms98-a-0033 264.074625 277.488375 it seems strange now at the university where i work it's uh strange too because they have places you can leave cans and some campus organization recycles them 
sw4328B-ms98-a-0034 277.488375 285.959250 and uh there is a campus recycling bins not bins but like i work in a library
sw4328B-ms98-a-0035 285.959250 292.804875 and there are barrels where we can recycle newspapers and different types of things but they're in staff areas
sw4328B-ms98-a-0036 292.804875 299.522000 but we have wanted to have specially marked trash cans next to all the copy machines
