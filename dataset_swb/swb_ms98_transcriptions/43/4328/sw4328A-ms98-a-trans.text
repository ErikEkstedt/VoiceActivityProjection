sw4328A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 8.702625 [noise] community i'll start we have a lot of uh we we've started doing some and uh in in uh we live in a suburb of Chicago
sw4328A-ms98-a-0002 8.702625 17.909250 recycling has become somewhat in vogue we've always had recycling centers around where you can take in newspapers and bottles and things and put them in the right bin
sw4328A-ms98-a-0003 17.909250 26.795625 but it's totally voluntary and basically only the ecologically minded would go to such pa[ins]- places because it's it's a drive out of your way to take things to these
sw4328A-ms98-a-0004 26.795625 40.709625 but recently we started a program i think is getting encourages a lot more participation which is uh you have to now pay for each trash bag that that the garbage man picks up you have to pay a dollar and a half
sw4328A-ms98-a-0005 40.709625 51.364250 and we uh you have to buy a sticker uh and it and it costs a dollar and a half and you have to put the sticker on your trash bag and if you don't have that sticker on there then the garbage man won't pick it up 
sw4328A-ms98-a-0006 51.364250 56.225375 now that's that that's for regular trash if you have recyclable trash
sw4328A-ms98-a-0007 56.225375 65.846000 like newspapers or right now it's limited to i think the newspapers and plastic bottles plastic milk bottles then they'll pick that up for free
sw4328A-ms98-a-0008 65.846000 74.422375 so there's the motivation basically your regular garbage you have to pay to get picked up and recyclable stuff if you put it in a recyclable bin
sw4328A-ms98-a-0009 74.422375 83.839750 or recyclable uh container they they give you one of these then that that doesn't cost anything so that encourages people to participate
