sw4314A-ms98-a-0043 142.604125 154.014750 oh that's fantastic yeah i used to uh kind of be that way myself when i lived in in northwestern Florida in the panhandle i used to sail about everyday i'd wor[k]- go to work
sw4314A-ms98-a-0044 154.014750 161.433875 yeah it's a lot of fun it's uh especially if you get a a pretty fast boat like those catamarans are pretty fast you can actually
sw4314A-ms98-a-0045 161.433875 164.223500 [silence]
sw4314A-ms98-a-0046 164.223500 175.081750 well actually i i've known how to sail pretty much my whole life um m[y]- my family's pretty into it and uh i took sailing lessons when i was about six and then uh [noise]
sw4314A-ms98-a-0047 175.081750 184.286625 yeah it's it's kind of a thing where you get the hang of it after a while you know um just kind of get a feel for the wind and how it works and and the physics behind it
sw4314A-ms98-a-0048 184.286625 196.634000 so it's it's not too bad it's pretty easy to get the hang of i think and uh generally everybody i've i've known has kind of gotten into it but some people are more motorboaters you know which is fun
sw4314A-ms98-a-0049 196.634000 206.521375 yeah yeah a lot of people don't don't see the excitement in sailing but then again they may [ne'er/never] m[ay]- they may never have tried anything like uh catamaran
sw4314A-ms98-a-0050 206.521375 215.551000 and uh that's when you really start getting into speed you know you can actually some catamarans can actually pull people behind the skiers they get so fast you know
sw4314A-ms98-a-0051 215.551000 218.768750 yeah they get pretty quick but uh
sw4314A-ms98-a-0052 218.768750 229.278375 yeah yeah i haven't i haven't personally done that but um the races i i work with a guy right now that uh [noise] races catamarans in the summertime
sw4314A-ms98-a-0053 229.278375 232.853750 and uh he's pretty gassed about it he's got a good uh
sw4314A-ms98-a-0054 232.853750 234.238250 [silence]
sw4314A-ms98-a-0055 234.238250 246.883500 well he uh he's from Detroit so he usually goes on one of the Great Lakes i think and does his sailing um for me i i go back to Orlando uh in about a month
sw4314A-ms98-a-0056 246.883500 256.504125 and so down there basically just go to the coast we're about thirty miles from Coco Beach and the East Coast and there's a lot of places there you can go you know
sw4314A-ms98-a-0057 256.504125 258.980625 so uh so that's a good thing
