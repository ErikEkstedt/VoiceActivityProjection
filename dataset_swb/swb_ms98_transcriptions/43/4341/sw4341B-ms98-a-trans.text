sw4341B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 36.426000 [silence]
sw4341B-ms98-a-0002 36.426000 42.485000 well i think that in some cases it is warranted es[pecially]-
sw4341B-ms98-a-0003 42.485000 48.491750 and i don't i think in some cases it doesn't matter if it's a deterrent or not
sw4341B-ms98-a-0004 48.491750 49.501750 [silence]
sw4341B-ms98-a-0005 49.501750 56.000500 i mean i mean i'm thinking of an extreme case like a serial murderer or
sw4341B-ms98-a-0006 56.000500 57.116125 [silence]
sw4341B-ms98-a-0007 57.116125 66.169875 well for some things i think for serial murderer it is warranted because if a person
sw4341B-ms98-a-0008 66.169875 67.995375 who
sw4341B-ms98-a-0009 67.995375 71.628250 would do something like that in cold blood
sw4341B-ms98-a-0010 71.628250 75.235875 [silence]
sw4341B-ms98-a-0011 75.235875 78.484125 i mean you can't
sw4341B-ms98-a-0012 78.484125 82.498375 guarantee that they wouldn't escape from prison
sw4341B-ms98-a-0013 82.498375 90.016875 and do it again and i don't think that that rehabilitation is effective
sw4341B-ms98-a-0014 90.016875 118.933875 [silence]
sw4341B-ms98-a-0015 118.933875 129.994000 but then you know i think that that some murderers don't really warrant capital punishment you know just like for example um
sw4341B-ms98-a-0016 129.994000 141.496625 you know you hear about cases where women have killed their husbands who abused them and i don't think that would really warrant capital punishment
sw4341B-ms98-a-0017 141.496625 151.007125 [silence]
sw4341B-ms98-a-0018 151.007125 156.962000 um it is to a certain extent but
sw4341B-ms98-a-0019 156.962000 160.009000 i think
sw4341B-ms98-a-0020 160.009000 162.992500 i don't know because
sw4341B-ms98-a-0021 162.992500 167.252625 [silence]
sw4341B-ms98-a-0022 167.252625 179.850250 i think in ce[rtain]- and it just would depend upon the circumstances and and the extent of the abuse and and if another alternative was available
sw4341B-ms98-a-0023 179.850250 223.392125 [silence]
sw4341B-ms98-a-0024 223.392125 231.379125 well i think that would be kind of drastic punishment
sw4341B-ms98-a-0025 231.379125 232.990500 and
sw4341B-ms98-a-0026 232.990500 234.597375 [silence]
sw4341B-ms98-a-0027 234.597375 238.075500 but one thing i think that if
sw4341B-ms98-a-0028 238.075500 241.998875 there is a chance for rehabilitation
sw4341B-ms98-a-0029 241.998875 247.380000 then that chance sh[ould]- should be investigated
sw4341B-ms98-a-0030 247.380000 253.365625 but like i said if if someone is is just pathologically
sw4341B-ms98-a-0031 253.365625 261.999125 going to murder people no matter what then i think they should be eliminated from society
sw4341B-ms98-a-0032 261.999125 265.983875 [silence]
sw4341B-ms98-a-0033 265.983875 267.337250 but
sw4341B-ms98-a-0034 267.337250 274.702875 [silence]
sw4341B-ms98-a-0035 274.702875 280.001375 and a lot of people that [laughter-are] a danger to society that aren't in prison
sw4341B-ms98-a-0036 280.001375 292.461875 [silence]
sw4341B-ms98-a-0037 292.461875 299.778000 well i know in North Carolina we do have capital punishment and i'm real[ly]- i'm from South Carolina
