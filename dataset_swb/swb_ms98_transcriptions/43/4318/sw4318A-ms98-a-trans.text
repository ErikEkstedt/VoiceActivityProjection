sw4318A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 3.271375 [noise] before the one will take um
sw4318A-ms98-a-0002 3.271375 5.717875 okay let's see i guess um
sw4318A-ms98-a-0003 5.717875 10.464500 i can start i'm actually we're actually trying to find one now because_1 our family's growing yeah
sw4318A-ms98-a-0004 10.464500 11.695000 um
sw4318A-ms98-a-0005 11.695000 19.491500 so i'm looking at um something larger than what we have we've got like an eighty four Charger that's about gone and a uh an eighty nine Horizon
sw4318A-ms98-a-0006 19.491500 23.818125 so i'm looking for something a little bigger yeah um
sw4318A-ms98-a-0007 23.818125 32.093375 so we were thinking minivan for a while and uh we're looking at uh some just some four door five passenger sedans as well 
sw4318A-ms98-a-0008 32.093375 35.973250 [silence]
sw4318A-ms98-a-0009 35.973250 40.664375 um i don't really have a preference either way i guess i[t]- you know it's
sw4318A-ms98-a-0010 40.664375 48.879250 you know [vocalized-noise] i guess the American cars had a bad reputation but i haven't had any real substantial problems with the ones i've had
sw4318A-ms98-a-0011 48.879250 54.226250 [silence]
sw4318A-ms98-a-0012 54.226250 55.501375 um-hum
sw4318A-ms98-a-0013 55.501375 67.426500 [silence]
sw4318A-ms98-a-0014 67.426500 69.430250 yeah
sw4318A-ms98-a-0015 69.430250 81.453125 [silence]
sw4318A-ms98-a-0016 81.453125 92.717500 yeah i mean e[ven]- even if it's just little details it seems like uh they you know like uh there's a door seal that [vocalized-noise] doesn't quite seal and you have to take it back every once in a while an[d]- and it's clearly just a a design problem there
sw4318A-ms98-a-0017 92.717500 106.917000 [silence]
sw4318A-ms98-a-0018 106.917000 108.119000 um-hum
sw4318A-ms98-a-0019 108.119000 111.086125 [silence]
sw4318A-ms98-a-0020 111.086125 113.535875 oh like a Miata or something like that
sw4318A-ms98-a-0021 113.535875 121.150625 [silence]
sw4318A-ms98-a-0022 121.150625 122.376500 um
sw4318A-ms98-a-0023 122.376500 126.119000 [silence]
sw4318A-ms98-a-0024 126.119000 127.341875 interest[ing]-
sw4318A-ms98-a-0025 127.341875 129.357875 [silence]
sw4318A-ms98-a-0026 129.357875 130.616625 yeah
sw4318A-ms98-a-0027 130.616625 133.134000 [silence]
sw4318A-ms98-a-0028 133.134000 142.051875 that's interesting yeah i guess probably the factors we'd use to compare are a little different because_1 i look for you know size and safety and then mileage probably
sw4318A-ms98-a-0029 142.051875 143.362500 uh-huh
sw4318A-ms98-a-0030 143.362500 155.652500 [silence]
sw4318A-ms98-a-0031 155.652500 161.773375 yeah yeah i c[an]- i think in terms of computer terminology i look at you know price performance and things like that
sw4318A-ms98-a-0032 161.773375 166.492375 and then a little bit at life expectancy i guess but it you know depends on what you
sw4318A-ms98-a-0033 166.492375 174.377125 what you pay initially but you know i've got a hundred and twenty five thousand miles on the Charger actually it was my wife's car that she brought into the marriage
sw4318A-ms98-a-0034 174.377125 177.520250 and she got just a commute between Cincinnati and Dayton
sw4318A-ms98-a-0035 177.520250 184.261750 it's you know we we had to replace the friction plate and the transmission at thirty thousand miles but
sw4318A-ms98-a-0036 184.261750 188.451250 um the other ninety four thousand have been [laughter-just] [laughter-fine] [laughter-with] [laughter-it] so
sw4318A-ms98-a-0037 188.451250 190.003750 but uh
sw4318A-ms98-a-0038 190.003750 207.803750 [silence]
sw4318A-ms98-a-0039 207.803750 209.037500 um
sw4318A-ms98-a-0040 209.037500 213.155125 [silence]
sw4318A-ms98-a-0041 213.155125 214.471875 um-hum
sw4318A-ms98-a-0042 214.471875 220.345500 [silence]
sw4318A-ms98-a-0043 220.345500 221.591000 yeah
sw4318A-ms98-a-0044 221.591000 225.992375 [silence]
sw4318A-ms98-a-0045 225.992375 227.639375 that's interesting
sw4318A-ms98-a-0046 227.639375 231.450875 but yeah it it's hard to beat some of the uh
sw4318A-ms98-a-0047 231.450875 241.006500 like i guess we're in particular we're looking at a like a ninety one Corsica that's uh buy back at a they say GM sponsored auction but i think they're obliged to have these things because
sw4318A-ms98-a-0048 241.006500 245.614625 Hertz and Avis and those folks have it in their contract that they can sell it back to GM
sw4318A-ms98-a-0049 245.614625 254.647000 after you know it's after they've used it for six months and put you know twelve or fifteen thousand miles on it and you can get those for like eight thousand bucks if you
sw4318A-ms98-a-0050 254.647000 255.878250 yeah
sw4318A-ms98-a-0051 255.878250 263.538750 because_1 uh i guess um i mean well ninety two's granted but the new ones you know fourteen to sixteen is what they go for
sw4318A-ms98-a-0052 263.538750 267.266625 on the lot so all the depreciation has been taken off and
sw4318A-ms98-a-0053 267.266625 278.423500 guess the dealer comes out okay you know i don't know what kind of i don't know what GM corporate kind of hit the i don't know what kind of hit they take on it but sounds like everybody's had their chance to make their money off of it
sw4318A-ms98-a-0054 278.423500 280.512250 [silence]
sw4318A-ms98-a-0055 280.512250 290.986375 so but uh i don't know we keep looking at that minivan it's just you know we can get a like a Caravan for right twelve five but that's a little more than we want to spend right now
sw4318A-ms98-a-0056 290.986375 292.848125 but uh
sw4318A-ms98-a-0057 292.848125 295.248250 uh it's interesting but uh
sw4318A-ms98-a-0058 295.248250 295.960125 [silence]
sw4318A-ms98-a-0059 295.960125 298.626000 i don't know if if uh i[t]- it seems to be
