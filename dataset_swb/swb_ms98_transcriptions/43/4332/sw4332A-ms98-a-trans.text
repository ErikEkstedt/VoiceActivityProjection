sw4332A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.183375 [noise]
sw4332A-ms98-a-0002 0.183375 7.165250 well i guess there's a lot of uh complex issues here some of which are moral and some are um
sw4332A-ms98-a-0003 7.165250 7.476750 [noise]
sw4332A-ms98-a-0004 7.476750 11.572875 more logistical as to the merits capital punishment
sw4332A-ms98-a-0005 11.572875 14.806750 i suppose the uh the moral ones are
sw4332A-ms98-a-0006 14.806750 15.821625 [silence]
sw4332A-ms98-a-0007 15.821625 21.727375 are the more nebulous when it comes to trying to discuss and the logistic ones i guess are
sw4332A-ms98-a-0008 21.727375 29.834625 uh i suppose a reasonable default on um issues the moral issue would be just let everybody live and not
sw4332A-ms98-a-0009 29.834625 36.892875 um not try and make those kind of judgmental errors but that goes and affects the logistical ones in that 
sw4332A-ms98-a-0010 36.892875 45.780000 now you have to care for somebody that you otherwise wouldn't have to i suppose that might actually be a uh pretty rude way of rude way of looking at it though
sw4332A-ms98-a-0011 45.780000 54.439125 [silence]
sw4332A-ms98-a-0012 54.439125 56.553375 yeah yeah
sw4332A-ms98-a-0013 56.553375 58.424875 [silence]
sw4332A-ms98-a-0014 58.424875 59.725625 yep
sw4332A-ms98-a-0015 59.725625 65.609750 [silence]
sw4332A-ms98-a-0016 65.609750 75.559625 yeah those are all good ones i suppose uh another one is um if you do decide that it's uh you know you want to do this
sw4332A-ms98-a-0017 75.559625 81.389875 is somebody capable of making the judgment rationally you know do we have the um
sw4332A-ms98-a-0018 81.389875 88.090000 do we really have that ability to go out and judge somebody's crime all these circumstances and other stuff and weigh it
sw4332A-ms98-a-0019 88.090000 89.374250 [silence]
sw4332A-ms98-a-0020 89.374250 98.620125 can we really do it are we are we that good that we can really do it it's like uh like nuclear power plants you know it's a great idea
sw4332A-ms98-a-0021 98.620125 103.693625 but logistically we just haven't been able to get our act together well enough to
sw4332A-ms98-a-0022 103.693625 121.803000 [silence]
sw4332A-ms98-a-0023 121.803000 124.333125 um yeah yeah
sw4332A-ms98-a-0024 124.333125 126.053125 yeah exactly
sw4332A-ms98-a-0025 126.053125 134.156000 [silence]
sw4332A-ms98-a-0026 134.156000 136.610250 yeah or shouldn't
sw4332A-ms98-a-0027 136.610250 138.183000 shouldn't be using it
sw4332A-ms98-a-0028 138.183000 140.245750 [silence]
sw4332A-ms98-a-0029 140.245750 146.257500 there's a lot of can'ts and shouldn'ts and don'ts and stuff that seem to be pretty well ignored these days
sw4332A-ms98-a-0030 146.257500 147.625500 [silence]
sw4332A-ms98-a-0031 147.625500 149.269875 um
sw4332A-ms98-a-0032 149.269875 153.772125 [silence]
sw4332A-ms98-a-0033 153.772125 162.904000 [laughter] well Evan uh i suppose they do have the death penalty down here i don't know if um if they executed anybody on it recently i don't think so
sw4332A-ms98-a-0034 162.904000 165.499000 uh i don't know you know it's gotten to the point where
sw4332A-ms98-a-0035 165.499000 170.800500 something like that if i see it in the paper or hear about it it's just kind of like in one ear and out the other
sw4332A-ms98-a-0036 170.800500 174.372250 some state recently executed somebody where was that Texas
sw4332A-ms98-a-0037 174.372250 180.661250 [silence]
sw4332A-ms98-a-0038 180.661250 186.524750 yeah what kind of crimes is it that they usually do this for murders big murders
sw4332A-ms98-a-0039 186.524750 188.551375 [silence]
sw4332A-ms98-a-0040 188.551375 189.813500 yeah
sw4332A-ms98-a-0041 189.813500 193.998250 [silence]
sw4332A-ms98-a-0042 193.998250 197.296875 yeah what did they uh give Jeffrey Dahlmer
sw4332A-ms98-a-0043 197.296875 199.396625 what did they do to him
sw4332A-ms98-a-0044 199.396625 202.735250 [silence]
sw4332A-ms98-a-0045 202.735250 205.206625 uh that would make too much sense
sw4332A-ms98-a-0046 205.206625 206.594875 [silence]
sw4332A-ms98-a-0047 206.594875 213.099625 yeah yeah seemed to me it was a relatively senseless thing to do with somebody that was so rare
sw4332A-ms98-a-0048 213.099625 215.335000 something kind of wasteful
sw4332A-ms98-a-0049 215.335000 217.267375 [noise] not that um
sw4332A-ms98-a-0050 217.267375 220.557500 not that we need more or anything like that
sw4332A-ms98-a-0051 220.557500 223.751625 [laughter]
sw4332A-ms98-a-0052 223.751625 225.634375 yeah that was a bizarre case
sw4332A-ms98-a-0053 225.634375 231.005375 and i g[uess]- are they did the government federal government pass some recent um
sw4332A-ms98-a-0054 231.005375 241.486125 regulation something about for ce[rtain]- certain crimes uh if um there's a gun involved or something like that the death penalty is automatic or is there something like that out there
sw4332A-ms98-a-0055 241.486125 250.712750 [silence]
sw4332A-ms98-a-0056 250.712750 252.111625 yeah
sw4332A-ms98-a-0057 252.111625 257.290500 [silence]
sw4332A-ms98-a-0058 257.290500 258.572250 yeah there's some real
sw4332A-ms98-a-0059 258.572250 263.317500 [silence]
sw4332A-ms98-a-0060 263.317500 264.978875 yeah
sw4332A-ms98-a-0061 264.978875 269.759875 they're they're often does seem to be backlash against light things
sw4332A-ms98-a-0062 269.759875 277.995000 i guess occasionally there's some about harsh stuff one harsh sentence that i kind of liked was uh Jim Bakker getting forty five years
sw4332A-ms98-a-0063 277.995000 279.038500 [silence]
sw4332A-ms98-a-0064 279.038500 285.829375 that's that seemed like justice but it seems they reevaluated his sentence or resentenced him or something like that i don't know if they changed it
sw4332A-ms98-a-0065 285.829375 294.361375 [silence]
sw4332A-ms98-a-0066 294.361375 296.602250 [laughter]
sw4332A-ms98-a-0067 296.602250 298.530000 yeah
