sw4353B-ms98-a-0032 130.695250 133.295375 [silence]
sw4353B-ms98-a-0033 133.295375 143.736625 yeah if if you have something to take it out that's exactly what we've always done and we've had uh they've always had um where they match your funds you know sometimes if you if you save so much then they'll match it
sw4353B-ms98-a-0034 143.736625 153.144750 um that you know we've done that too but my husband works for an insurance company and he he has now for about oh gosh how long has it been ten years i guess
sw4353B-ms98-a-0035 153.144750 159.349875 but he was with another company before that but we have we have i- i work also but i only have a part time job
sw4353B-ms98-a-0036 159.349875 166.665625 and i get paid very little but um you know i try to use that money for food mo[ney]- Jim gives me a certain amount money
sw4353B-ms98-a-0037 166.665625 175.253125 you know we just transfer it into my account and then i use that for food household expenses and then i add my own check to that and then with that i try and handle
sw4353B-ms98-a-0038 175.253125 181.663375 you know some of the clothes that the girls need and and things like that but the expenses that we need around have around the house
sw4353B-ms98-a-0039 181.663375 182.958500 so
sw4353B-ms98-a-0040 182.958500 184.582625 [silence]

sw4353B-ms98-a-0045 201.353625 211.549375 you know i don't ask for more i mean i just try and make it on that because i think when you go to the grocery store you can just you can go crazy with all the choices that you have
sw4353B-ms98-a-0046 211.549375 217.822500 and uh you can b[uy]- you can really waste a lot of money that way so um well how long have you been married
sw4353B-ms98-a-0047 217.822500 219.140875 [silence]
sw4353B-ms98-a-0048 219.140875 224.586500 oh yeah so you're just really getting started [laughter] so do you have a family too

sw4353B-ms98-a-0051 229.654750 231.369000 [silence]
sw4353B-ms98-a-0052 231.369000 233.846750 she hasn't affected your budget yet really
sw4353B-ms98-a-0053 233.846750 245.326875 no no not like she will later on you'll you'll see that because_1 all of a sudden you're paying you're trying to decide whether you are going to do you know soccer and piano and all these choices that they have of activities to do
sw4353B-ms98-a-0054 245.326875 256.524125 and then you really have to start saying okay now what can we afford you know what can we do here and then you have to really sit down and plan some more and uh but i think when we were back at your age we didn't have much of a budget
sw4353B-ms98-a-0055 256.524125 263.390375 and then as the girls got older i think we we did more and more of that you know more budgeting as as they got older
sw4353B-ms98-a-0056 263.390375 265.994500 um but um
sw4353B-ms98-a-0057 265.994500 268.299875 but what do you do do you
sw4353B-ms98-a-0058 268.299875 271.574500 [silence]
sw4353B-ms98-a-0059 271.574500 273.176125 oh okay
sw4353B-ms98-a-0060 273.176125 275.418500 [silence]
sw4353B-ms98-a-0061 275.418500 277.795125 oh well good good
sw4353B-ms98-a-0062 277.795125 288.870625 well we just have yeah we have a good friend that's about to move to Atlanta i guess we're not supposed to talk about those things i better get back to the subject but um budgeting i found you know i feel a lot better you know we used to work out of one checkbook
sw4353B-ms98-a-0063 288.870625 298.306000 and it would be very hard for me because i wouldn't have i wouldn't have any idea of how much money i was spending in one month now i have know exactly what i'm spending and it is so much
