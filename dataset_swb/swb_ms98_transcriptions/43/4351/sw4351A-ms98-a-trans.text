sw4351A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.468250 [noise] home [laughter] because_1 i'm
sw4351A-ms98-a-0002 1.468250 3.083125 leaving from work
sw4351A-ms98-a-0003 3.083125 11.103500 okay well uh i don't know if i mentioned to you last time we talked but uh i just recently retired from the Army
sw4351A-ms98-a-0004 11.103500 23.229250 active duty twenty years and of course when you're active duty military you are required to not only to maintain a certain level of uh weight and physical fitness
sw4351A-ms98-a-0005 23.229250 32.515125 but you're required to take a what we call a P T test physical uh physical training test uh twice a year
sw4351A-ms98-a-0006 32.515125 42.133250 so we were constantly expected to exercise and be in shape and then we had specific standards we had to meet based on our age group
sw4351A-ms98-a-0007 42.133250 52.114875 and if you didn't pass the test [noise] then they put you on what they called remedial P T and every morning you have to go to the company and
sw4351A-ms98-a-0008 52.114875 60.089000 jog in formation [laughter] in which really did not prepare you for the next physical fitness test but was more a form of punishment 
sw4351A-ms98-a-0009 60.089000 61.352375 [laughter]
sw4351A-ms98-a-0010 61.352375 63.754500 [silence]
sw4351A-ms98-a-0011 63.754500 71.247875 what do i do now well as the result of that i really got to enjoy uh long uh distance running
sw4351A-ms98-a-0012 71.247875 78.837250 and so i i trained quite regularly and i i raced quite often i tried to do like a ten kilometer foot race uh once a month or so
sw4351A-ms98-a-0013 78.837250 86.317125 now that i am out i pretty much kept with it until i got a job in Virginia and i live in Maryland
sw4351A-ms98-a-0014 86.317125 92.194750 and so by the time i i get up early and drive and hour to an hour and a half here
sw4351A-ms98-a-0015 92.194750 100.086750 which is about fifty miles work all day [laughter] fifty miles back on the Capitol Beltway and of course it's dark by the time i get home and 
sw4351A-ms98-a-0016 100.086750 105.679875 so i have to admit [laughter] that i i have fallen off uh slightly 
sw4351A-ms98-a-0017 105.679875 109.160000 or maybe even considerably or maybe even completely
sw4351A-ms98-a-0018 109.160000 115.057500 and uh so i am not doing much now which concerns me because i just had my forty ninth birthday
sw4351A-ms98-a-0019 115.057500 120.558500 so i want to keep at it because i know that if you don't uh there's there's lots of problems that you can have
sw4351A-ms98-a-0020 120.558500 131.305250 yeah and so uh i want to get back at it as soon as spring breaks and uh but what we have done is uh decreased considerably the amount of fat that we consume in our diet
sw4351A-ms98-a-0021 131.305250 133.418125 and uh how about yourself
sw4351A-ms98-a-0022 133.418125 136.127875 [silence]
sw4351A-ms98-a-0023 136.127875 138.010625 um uh-huh
sw4351A-ms98-a-0024 138.010625 140.743625 [silence]
sw4351A-ms98-a-0025 140.743625 142.151375 uh-huh
sw4351A-ms98-a-0026 142.151375 144.119500 [silence]
sw4351A-ms98-a-0027 144.119500 147.515500 um so you have a good sustained work out 
sw4351A-ms98-a-0028 147.515500 149.179875 yeah
sw4351A-ms98-a-0029 149.179875 155.452250 oh yeah yeah that's that is a long time to have [laughter] at it but that's of course uh
sw4351A-ms98-a-0030 155.452250 161.949375 uh there's a lot of sudden fast changes in direction and i don't know does that cause you any injuries or anything
sw4351A-ms98-a-0031 161.949375 162.994500 [silence]
sw4351A-ms98-a-0032 162.994500 164.290500 no
sw4351A-ms98-a-0033 164.290500 169.211375 [silence]
sw4351A-ms98-a-0034 169.211375 170.711500 uh-huh
sw4351A-ms98-a-0035 170.711500 174.001625 [laughter-right] either an elbow in the eye
sw4351A-ms98-a-0036 174.001625 175.489875 [silence]
sw4351A-ms98-a-0037 175.489875 176.927500 right
sw4351A-ms98-a-0038 176.927500 178.493500 [silence]
sw4351A-ms98-a-0039 178.493500 185.320500 uh-huh the nice thing i liked about foot racing was that uh for me it was pretty much non competitive
sw4351A-ms98-a-0040 185.320500 193.983250 uh i didn't have to worry so much about being a part of a team or anything and so i could just compete against myself or the clock or the next guy ahead of me 
sw4351A-ms98-a-0041 193.983250 199.487625 and uh that fulfilled my urge to compete while at the same time keeping me fit
sw4351A-ms98-a-0042 199.487625 208.244125 but i did uh i had the privilege of going to what the Army calls our master fitness trainer course which was uh a month long course at 
sw4351A-ms98-a-0043 208.244125 215.561875 Fort Ben Harrison Indiana and i learned a lot from that about uh the difference between aerobic and anaerobic exercise
sw4351A-ms98-a-0044 215.561875 217.313625 that sort of thing and
sw4351A-ms98-a-0045 217.313625 221.282500 so at least from that i [noise] i realize the importance of it 
sw4351A-ms98-a-0046 221.282500 222.308500 and uh
sw4351A-ms98-a-0047 222.308500 227.466000 [silence]
sw4351A-ms98-a-0048 227.466000 229.165000 uh
sw4351A-ms98-a-0049 229.165000 240.317000 not so much that but i have noticed a difference because i am not exercising as much anymore in the uh in my heart rate which slowly creeps up as you get less and less fit
sw4351A-ms98-a-0050 240.317000 252.596000 and uh i haven't weighed myself in a good while [noise] but uh uh i just had a recently had a physical and they said that my uh triglycerides and the cholesterol and all that were in in pretty good shape 
sw4351A-ms98-a-0051 252.596000 261.124125 and my wife uh was keeping real close track of it because she uh wanted to see what effect it would have on her and it she showed a significant improvement 
sw4351A-ms98-a-0052 261.124125 268.894500 through just simple things like you're going for low fat lunch meats for uh when we bring our lunches to work and uh [noise]
sw4351A-ms98-a-0053 268.894500 276.049625 uh matter of fact i've very seldom uh use uh sugar or salt either uh it takes a little getting use to
sw4351A-ms98-a-0054 276.049625 281.300000 but uh uh skim milk is what we drink now and that took a little getting use to
sw4351A-ms98-a-0055 281.300000 291.232250 but uh we have well at least she has noticed a significant change in h[er]- in her cholesterol and uh and triglycerides which is which is good
sw4351A-ms98-a-0056 291.232250 299.618000 yeah and uh so she's slowly working herself into a uh a moderate fitness program
