sw4357A-ms98-a-0002 5.650250 13.442625 she lived with us when i was a little girl for about three or four years and then we had to put her in a rest home and
sw4357A-ms98-a-0003 13.442625 16.201250 yeah she had to have nurses care
sw4357A-ms98-a-0004 16.201250 26.836750 and yeah it was a really hard decision because i she had nine kids and they had all decided that between the nine of them they could keep her at their home
sw4357A-ms98-a-0005 26.836750 33.927125 but uh her health just failed so much that they couldn't do that she needed an IV and things
sw4357A-ms98-a-0006 33.927125 39.560250 [silence]
sw4357A-ms98-a-0007 39.560250 41.422875 oh wow

sw4357A-ms98-a-0011 51.899750 58.720250 [silence]

sw4357A-ms98-a-0016 70.631000 76.221375 yeah that's what's neat is when they don't have to go into a rest home or anything
sw4357A-ms98-a-0017 76.221375 80.605875 [silence]
sw4357A-ms98-a-0018 80.605875 85.168375 yeah my grandpa lived to be ninety four and
sw4357A-ms98-a-0019 85.168375 96.651625 his grandma or his wife was uh ten years younger than him and she kept him at home his uh about the last two years of his life she had him in a hospital bed
sw4357A-ms98-a-0020 96.651625 108.157500 and you know the port a potty and stuff she he couldn't get up or anything but she threatened that she'd never put that man in a rest home and she never did [laughter]
sw4357A-ms98-a-0021 108.157500 113.255375 oh yeah uh she has osteopor[osis]- [vocalized-noise] i don't know how to say it
sw4357A-ms98-a-0022 113.255375 123.349375 anyway where their back bends and stuff and the bones deteriorate and it really did a toll on her lifting him and stuff but she
sw4357A-ms98-a-0023 123.349375 128.809750 she would have died before she let anyone put him in there in a rest home
sw4357A-ms98-a-0024 128.809750 129.974500 [silence]
sw4357A-ms98-a-0025 129.974500 137.785125 but when my grand when my one grandma that did go in the rest home we found a really nice one the you know we'd go visit every night
sw4357A-ms98-a-0026 137.785125 139.561750 and she only
sw4357A-ms98-a-0027 139.561750 145.648250 [laughter] well she was only there for about a month and she was really bad we you know we knew it was coming
sw4357A-ms98-a-0028 145.648250 152.142125 and i you know we felt really bad for putting her [laughter-there] [laughter-and] stuff she was unconscious and so
