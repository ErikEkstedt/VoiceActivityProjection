sw4324A-ms98-a-0014 38.002625 41.602125 [silence]

sw4324A-ms98-a-0019 54.910500 56.223000 [silence]
sw4324A-ms98-a-0020 56.223000 57.549625 no
sw4324A-ms98-a-0021 57.549625 62.687250 [silence]
sw4324A-ms98-a-0022 62.687250 65.453875 oh you're a student oh okay
sw4324A-ms98-a-0023 65.453875 66.688375 [silence]
sw4324A-ms98-a-0024 66.688375 70.630500 uh why don't i ask you the question um you know uh
sw4324A-ms98-a-0025 70.630500 72.548375 i don't know um
sw4324A-ms98-a-0026 72.548375 80.291750 being uh d[o]- i'll just ask you know d[o]- do you think income taxes work for this country or should we have a broad base tax
sw4324A-ms98-a-0027 80.291750 82.076000 [silence]
sw4324A-ms98-a-0028 82.076000 84.893250 of everybody just pays a flat rate 
sw4324A-ms98-a-0029 84.893250 86.780125 ten percent
sw4324A-ms98-a-0030 86.780125 88.174500 what
sw4324A-ms98-a-0031 88.174500 94.598500 okay all right i'll talk to you in a bit h[old]- okay uh i'll just press one okay here we go
sw4324A-ms98-a-0032 94.598500 96.993875 [noise]
sw4324A-ms98-a-0033 96.993875 98.897750 [silence]
sw4324A-ms98-a-0034 98.897750 103.571750 right i g[uess]- i guess i'm just wondering uh what your thoughts are on taxes uh um
sw4324A-ms98-a-0035 103.571750 110.174375 do you think that we should just have a kind of a broad based tax or just uh or do you like it the way it's set up now
sw4324A-ms98-a-0036 110.174375 127.557000 [silence]
sw4324A-ms98-a-0037 127.557000 128.780750 yeah
sw4324A-ms98-a-0038 128.780750 130.724250 [silence]
sw4324A-ms98-a-0039 130.724250 140.975125 well yeah i suppose that's i suppose that's true in i- i guess i'm more for kind of a just a across the board tax because that way everybody would pay
sw4324A-ms98-a-0040 140.975125 147.892375 the s[ame]- a rate that's equal to what they were doing i mean if somebody only made ten thousand dollars a year and it was a ten percent tax
sw4324A-ms98-a-0041 147.892375 152.153625 they're paying a thousand dollars whereas if somebody's making a million dollars a year
sw4324A-ms98-a-0042 152.153625 155.753625 uh you know what i mean they're paying a hundred thousand dollars in taxes
sw4324A-ms98-a-0043 155.753625 163.038500 as opposed to which what it seems like now which is you know these guys get away with uh all these tax breaks and everything else like that
sw4324A-ms98-a-0044 163.038500 170.397750 that apply to them but they don't apply to the little guys so it seems like the [vocalized-noise] all the t[axes]- you know taxes are being paid by everybody else
sw4324A-ms98-a-0045 170.397750 172.139875 seems kind of crazy
sw4324A-ms98-a-0046 172.139875 176.138375 [silence]
sw4324A-ms98-a-0047 176.138375 177.383500 yeah
sw4324A-ms98-a-0048 177.383500 178.546250 [silence]
sw4324A-ms98-a-0049 178.546250 182.368500 e[xactly]- exactly just everybody pays ten percent that's it
sw4324A-ms98-a-0050 182.368500 193.123625 and then nobody has to worry about whether you know i get this and i get that and uh you know or this person gets a tax break but this person doesn't when this person makes that much more money
sw4324A-ms98-a-0051 193.123625 199.162250 i mean that way you know somebody that's uh that's making uh ten million dollars pays a million bucks in taxes
sw4324A-ms98-a-0052 199.162250 205.947125 they um uh see i guess the problem with that is are they really using their fair share
sw4324A-ms98-a-0053 205.947125 207.187250 [silence]
sw4324A-ms98-a-0054 207.187250 210.752375 of the person that pays that many that much more taxes
sw4324A-ms98-a-0055 210.752375 211.879250 [silence]
sw4324A-ms98-a-0056 211.879250 215.326875 but then again they have as much use to the of the system as everybody
sw4324A-ms98-a-0057 215.326875 220.276500 [silence]
sw4324A-ms98-a-0058 220.276500 230.951875 i don't know if that that would make sense i guess uh i guess what people do i guess the government's incentive now is to create incentives so that people will do more i guess house building or
sw4324A-ms98-a-0059 230.951875 239.441250 buying homes or you know because of they give them br[eak]- tax break on their interest because_1 i have a break on our interest i mean all our our all our mortgage interest is deductible
sw4324A-ms98-a-0060 239.441250 245.783750 um but it doesn't seem like they do a damn good job with the uh uh with the way they're spending the taxes
sw4324A-ms98-a-0061 245.783750 248.681125 [silence]
sw4324A-ms98-a-0062 248.681125 250.451625 exactly
sw4324A-ms98-a-0063 250.451625 256.441125 i mean they only just recently got rid of the interest uh that was deductible on credit cards and car loans and things like that
sw4324A-ms98-a-0064 256.441125 262.059375 yeah but the major borrowing is still there i mean you know on mortgages and things like that
sw4324A-ms98-a-0065 262.059375 267.181750 uh although i don't think that we could afford our house without having that uh mortgage deduction
sw4324A-ms98-a-0066 267.181750 271.072750 um you know it actually cuts down four hundred bucks a month
sw4324A-ms98-a-0067 271.072750 274.551000 [silence]
sw4324A-ms98-a-0068 274.551000 278.952375 i don't know that's a good question i- i don't know whether they did or not
sw4324A-ms98-a-0069 278.952375 294.246250 [silence]
sw4324A-ms98-a-0070 294.246250 295.801625 [laughter-right]
sw4324A-ms98-a-0071 295.801625 298.690000 [silence]
