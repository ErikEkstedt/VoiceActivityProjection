sw4382A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.614000 [noise]
sw4382A-ms98-a-0002 0.614000 4.352375 [noise] well here in Logan Utah
sw4382A-ms98-a-0003 4.352375 10.360500 we got a nice little valley here and it's like crystal clear all the time except for during the winter
sw4382A-ms98-a-0004 10.360500 11.439000 [silence]
sw4382A-ms98-a-0005 11.439000 16.525125 when the inversion sets in and then we get a little bit of pollution in the valley
sw4382A-ms98-a-0006 16.525125 47.368250 [silence]
sw4382A-ms98-a-0007 47.368250 48.596875 yeah
sw4382A-ms98-a-0008 48.596875 51.416375 yeah definitely here in Utah
sw4382A-ms98-a-0009 51.416375 55.359625 up along the Wasatch front along the
sw4382A-ms98-a-0010 55.359625 64.992500 western side of the of these Rocky Mountains here where a lot of the big cities are Salt Lake and Ogden and Provo and Logan's up in the valley a little bit further north
sw4382A-ms98-a-0011 64.992500 70.736875 we get a lot of pollution and it's like seventy percent of it's from cars
sw4382A-ms98-a-0012 70.736875 72.477875 and uh
sw4382A-ms98-a-0013 72.477875 73.592000 [silence]
sw4382A-ms98-a-0014 73.592000 78.292500 it always really hits hard during the winter when we get the [noise] inversion and when we get
sw4382A-ms98-a-0015 78.292500 79.359875 [silence]
sw4382A-ms98-a-0016 79.359875 91.035125 get cold air down in the valleys and warm air up above and it just sits and sits and sits and we're starting to hit pollution levels now on the Wasatch front which match that of LA a few years ago
sw4382A-ms98-a-0017 91.035125 100.111875 it's not it's almost sad because when i grew up here it was just always the crisp air up in the mountain valleys and now it's not in the mountain valleys
sw4382A-ms98-a-0018 100.111875 110.531000 [silence]
sw4382A-ms98-a-0019 110.531000 111.624375 [noise]
sw4382A-ms98-a-0020 111.624375 116.051000 [silence]
sw4382A-ms98-a-0021 116.051000 117.157625 huh
sw4382A-ms98-a-0022 117.157625 120.905625 [silence]
sw4382A-ms98-a-0023 120.905625 131.055250 they're getting serious about things like uh mandatory well they've already passed laws where you have to get your cars checked for pollution if you're in certain counties emissions
sw4382A-ms98-a-0024 131.055250 132.326500 [silence]
sw4382A-ms98-a-0025 132.326500 140.370875 yeah they've actually started doing it down along the not in Logan up here because_1 we're doing a lot better we have a lot population's a lot lighter up here
sw4382A-ms98-a-0026 140.370875 163.421250 [silence]
sw4382A-ms98-a-0027 163.421250 164.564375 yeah
sw4382A-ms98-a-0028 164.564375 166.969250 [silence]
sw4382A-ms98-a-0029 166.969250 169.626125 yep they're ge[tting]- eliminating that out here
sw4382A-ms98-a-0030 169.626125 173.519000 they're also talking very seriously about the thing called a dirt gun
sw4382A-ms98-a-0031 173.519000 180.420000 where they're uh looking at the emissions from the car using basically a spectrometer and looking at the
sw4382A-ms98-a-0032 180.420000 185.196000 basically how much of what is coming out the exhaust kind of like a radar gun
sw4382A-ms98-a-0033 185.196000 187.585875 and yes
sw4382A-ms98-a-0034 187.585875 194.110750 yeah do it remotely just looking at the what they do they do several different types of things sometimes they put a source light
sw4382A-ms98-a-0035 194.110750 202.230375 and they look at the source light and then as the car goes by you can see the exhaust pipe and the source light behind it and you can look at the emissions actually
sw4382A-ms98-a-0036 202.230375 203.610500 and
sw4382A-ms98-a-0037 203.610500 204.885875 [silence]
sw4382A-ms98-a-0038 204.885875 211.380125 like across the street they'll set up like a trap or something that add in some sense and they're also looking at uh
sw4382A-ms98-a-0039 211.380125 212.712125 other
sw4382A-ms98-a-0040 212.712125 218.402500 you know ways of monitoring this and because_1 they found out something basically that uh
sw4382A-ms98-a-0041 218.402500 227.196000 and a poorly tuned car can emit something it's an incredible amount it was like four hundred times as much
sw4382A-ms98-a-0042 227.196000 228.651500 um
sw4382A-ms98-a-0043 228.651500 232.270000 of certain pollutants and it was like unburned hydrocarbons
sw4382A-ms98-a-0044 232.270000 237.988375 then a a properly tuned car and and the idea being that if you just tuned up
sw4382A-ms98-a-0045 237.988375 245.100000 all the cars well if you tuned up this ten percent of the cars that were producing like fifty percent of the
sw4382A-ms98-a-0046 245.100000 247.302750 the pollution then
sw4382A-ms98-a-0047 247.302750 251.356750 you know you'd it be one way to cut the pollution in half
sw4382A-ms98-a-0048 251.356750 277.531250 [silence]
sw4382A-ms98-a-0049 277.531250 278.657375 uh-huh

sw4382A-ms98-a-0051 290.617375 291.758250 um

sw4382A-ms98-a-0053 292.795625 294.054500 yeah and they're
