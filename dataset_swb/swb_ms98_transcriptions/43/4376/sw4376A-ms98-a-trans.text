sw4376A-ms98-a-0003 8.809000 10.671000 but not for petty theft
sw4376A-ms98-a-0004 10.671000 20.498000 [silence]
sw4376A-ms98-a-0005 20.498000 21.605625 [noise]
sw4376A-ms98-a-0006 21.605625 24.738625 [noise] well it should be used as a deterrent do you think
sw4376A-ms98-a-0007 24.738625 25.960000 [silence]
sw4376A-ms98-a-0008 25.960000 31.987750 or should it be used uh a[s]- to prevent further uh crime li[ke]-
sw4376A-ms98-a-0009 31.987750 33.344250 [silence]
sw4376A-ms98-a-0010 33.344250 34.441875 hm
sw4376A-ms98-a-0011 34.441875 42.509875 [silence]
sw4376A-ms98-a-0012 42.509875 43.936375 um-hum
sw4376A-ms98-a-0013 43.936375 51.746000 [silence]
sw4376A-ms98-a-0014 51.746000 61.678500 well you know there's this old um Jewish is it saying about an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth [noise]
sw4376A-ms98-a-0015 61.678500 72.934750 [silence]
sw4376A-ms98-a-0016 72.934750 86.242250 uh one of the things i was thinking about is uh you know from society's point of view if you put a value on each person what you want to do is to maximize the end game value
sw4376A-ms98-a-0017 86.242250 90.778500 so if you have someone that that destroys that value
sw4376A-ms98-a-0018 90.778500 98.466125 uh then what you want to take steps to uh minimize the loss of course you have to also put value on the criminal
sw4376A-ms98-a-0019 98.466125 101.950000 so if you terminate him that's a loss of value
sw4376A-ms98-a-0020 101.950000 105.355750 so you know if you weight everyone equally
sw4376A-ms98-a-0021 105.355750 120.192500 then you have to say well the likelihood of not terminating him i[f]- if you don't terminate him the likelihood is expected value of loss of life is greater than one person in other words you'd have to you'd have to murder more than one other person
sw4376A-ms98-a-0022 120.192500 121.487875 [silence]
sw4376A-ms98-a-0023 121.487875 124.485375 uh in order to justify taking his life
sw4376A-ms98-a-0024 124.485375 131.391625 another way you could do it is weight this value by uh the value to society of the people
sw4376A-ms98-a-0025 131.391625 134.225375 uh which is pretty uh
sw4376A-ms98-a-0026 134.225375 138.509625 delicate thing to do but one way of doing it is uh by income
sw4376A-ms98-a-0027 138.509625 145.866750 so [laughter] if this guy doesn't make a great deal of money which is often times the case then
sw4376A-ms98-a-0028 145.866750 155.713125 then he's obviously not worth very much and so uh the likelihood that you know maybe expected expected murders by him is is um
sw4376A-ms98-a-0029 155.713125 162.670250 integrated over the income of the people uh that he murders is maybe you know a loss of
sw4376A-ms98-a-0030 162.670250 166.879500 [noise] who knows eight hundred thousand dollars
sw4376A-ms98-a-0031 166.879500 175.541750 uh but if he only uh integrated you know integrated income over the ex[pected]- expected remainder of his life is um
sw4376A-ms98-a-0032 175.541750 188.413250 small less than eight hundred thousand dollars then you terminate him of course one of the things that happens if you use that algorithm is you find that it's more easy it's easier to uh to uh
sw4376A-ms98-a-0033 188.413250 199.197625 uh terminate older people than younger people since the uh uh integration of their income over the rest of their lives is going to be less
sw4376A-ms98-a-0034 199.197625 204.920750 which means well i suppose you could say well that has something to do with potential for rehabilitation
sw4376A-ms98-a-0035 204.920750 208.959875 [silence]
sw4376A-ms98-a-0036 208.959875 210.988375 um-hum
sw4376A-ms98-a-0037 210.988375 213.568875 [silence]
sw4376A-ms98-a-0038 213.568875 220.778375 now that's all fine and well and and uh good philosophically but if you're involved yourself personally
sw4376A-ms98-a-0039 220.778375 223.684625 uh i know i have a friend whose
sw4376A-ms98-a-0040 223.684625 226.660000 uh son was murdered
sw4376A-ms98-a-0041 226.660000 230.252375 o[n]- on the night before his sixteenth birthday
sw4376A-ms98-a-0042 230.252375 231.324375 [silence]
sw4376A-ms98-a-0043 231.324375 238.694250 and let me tell you uh i- i knew them personally uh not intimately but quite well and uh
sw4376A-ms98-a-0044 238.694250 240.192125 [silence]
sw4376A-ms98-a-0045 240.192125 246.425625 you're talking about real trauma i mean trauma that extends beyond the counting of bodies
sw4376A-ms98-a-0046 246.425625 247.768125 [silence]
sw4376A-ms98-a-0047 247.768125 250.606000 uh the father you know o[f]- of course
sw4376A-ms98-a-0048 250.606000 260.107250 um a parent losing a teenage child is about as bad as it could possibly get i think in terms of psychological impact
sw4376A-ms98-a-0049 260.107250 261.703375 um
sw4376A-ms98-a-0050 261.703375 262.916125 [noise]
sw4376A-ms98-a-0051 262.916125 264.069500 and
sw4376A-ms98-a-0052 264.069500 269.868625 oh yes they found him and he is on trial for capital murder
sw4376A-ms98-a-0053 269.868625 270.893125 [silence]
sw4376A-ms98-a-0054 270.893125 280.914000 uh well actually he i['m]- i'm sorry he uh was convicted uh and of course now you know and you go through two or three hundred years of appeals process but
