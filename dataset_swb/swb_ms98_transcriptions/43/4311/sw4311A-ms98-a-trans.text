sw4311A-ms98-a-0002 1.668125 3.406875 go ahead [laughter]
sw4311A-ms98-a-0003 3.406875 16.913750 [silence]
sw4311A-ms98-a-0004 16.913750 18.330875 hm
sw4311A-ms98-a-0005 18.330875 19.986500 [silence]
sw4311A-ms98-a-0006 19.986500 23.001625 well you should've you should have some opinions on that then
sw4311A-ms98-a-0007 23.001625 42.366500 [silence]
sw4311A-ms98-a-0008 42.366500 46.994875 well i guess if i were going to choose i mean my first consideration would be safety
sw4311A-ms98-a-0009 46.994875 49.957125 [noise] my second consideration would be uh
sw4311A-ms98-a-0010 49.957125 51.685125 [noise] um
sw4311A-ms98-a-0011 51.685125 53.714875 health
sw4311A-ms98-a-0012 53.714875 57.457500 and uh i guess my third consideration would be uh
sw4311A-ms98-a-0013 57.457500 59.174250 warm
sw4311A-ms98-a-0014 59.174250 63.039875 environment warm personal environment
sw4311A-ms98-a-0015 63.039875 113.742250 [silence]
sw4311A-ms98-a-0016 113.742250 125.838750 oh absolutely [noise] as a matter of fact i believe that the safety and and health uh issues uh depend in a very direct way on the people who are working with the children
sw4311A-ms98-a-0017 125.838750 132.879375 [silence]
sw4311A-ms98-a-0018 132.879375 136.704750 and it's the most difficult thing of all for a parent
sw4311A-ms98-a-0019 136.704750 148.128875 judge uh because a person can be very nice and warm and loving but if he's a space cadet and doesn't watch the children and be aware of what the safety hazards are
sw4311A-ms98-a-0020 148.128875 190.346250 [silence]
sw4311A-ms98-a-0021 190.346250 194.969625 [noise] maybe the right thing to do is to um
sw4311A-ms98-a-0022 194.969625 198.300250 [noise] when a couple has a child
sw4311A-ms98-a-0023 198.300250 208.736125 [noise] then they should both take you say the first four or five years are the most important and i think i would agree with that they both take four or five years off and devote to parenting
sw4311A-ms98-a-0024 208.736125 212.861000 get rid of all these child care centers
sw4311A-ms98-a-0025 212.861000 217.267500 at least for young kids below the age of six
sw4311A-ms98-a-0026 217.267500 219.666000 and then [noise]
sw4311A-ms98-a-0027 219.666000 229.907000 um and then of course to make up for that um the uh parents would have to work in their later years longer i[n]- in other words they probably would not work
sw4311A-ms98-a-0028 229.907000 234.215250 may not en[d]- may end up not working at all in the twenties
sw4311A-ms98-a-0029 234.215250 236.105750 oh
sw4311A-ms98-a-0030 236.105750 243.056875 but they may have to work from age thirty or or forty to age seventy or eighty or ninety
sw4311A-ms98-a-0031 243.056875 246.200000 [laughter]
sw4311A-ms98-a-0032 246.200000 252.616000 [silence]
sw4311A-ms98-a-0033 252.616000 258.661250 right well you know the uh uh the world is changing f[rom]- uh uh uh uh
sw4311A-ms98-a-0034 258.661250 271.203000 from instit[utional]- from uh industrial uh base to uh information base and so what that means is you don't have to be physically powerful to work
sw4311A-ms98-a-0035 271.203000 277.456000 all you have to do is have a sharp mind and i believe that uh mental acuity is
sw4311A-ms98-a-0036 277.456000 284.500875 easy to sustain maintain if you just simply continue to exercise your mind [noise]
sw4311A-ms98-a-0037 284.500875 296.866000 [noise] so i think a person could work [noise] uh into the seventies eighties even nineties for that matter if they didn't have to do a lot of physical uh labor they could main[tain]- maintain uh a
