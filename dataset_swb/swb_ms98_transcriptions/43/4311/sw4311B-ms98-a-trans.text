sw4311B-ms98-a-0002 1.065375 2.130625 [silence]
sw4311B-ms98-a-0003 2.130625 10.086125 oh [laughter-okay] yeah the uh subject is child care and how to determine child care and
sw4311B-ms98-a-0004 10.086125 17.698625 that's uh an interesting one for me to talk about since i have no children but i did run a child care facility for a while
sw4311B-ms98-a-0005 17.698625 21.496625 and uh have some
sw4311B-ms98-a-0006 21.496625 34.122750 i do have some thoughts on that yeah and it's uh an interesting experience to be a surrogate parent for or a parent for a lot of people there
sw4311B-ms98-a-0007 34.122750 42.584375 and um [noise] it's also very interesting in terms of how people choose [noise] the child care facilities [noise]
sw4311B-ms98-a-0008 42.584375 46.558750 [silence]
sw4311B-ms98-a-0009 46.558750 49.698375 right [noise]
sw4311B-ms98-a-0010 49.698375 53.019625 [silence]
sw4311B-ms98-a-0011 53.019625 54.592875 right [noise]
sw4311B-ms98-a-0012 54.592875 62.228375 [silence]
sw4311B-ms98-a-0013 62.228375 76.780125 well right um in Texas we have to meet certain state standards in order to operate [noise] on a at an institutional level and at a like a small home level so
sw4311B-ms98-a-0014 76.780125 89.374500 [noise] uh you meet the standards [noise] but then after that there's there's a lot more i think it's important as the safety and health and that kind of stuff is qualification of people who work there 
sw4311B-ms98-a-0015 89.374500 101.467000 and in hiring people who would work at the uh day care the child care facility was very difficult to find qualified people
sw4311B-ms98-a-0016 101.467000 115.007625 um in terms of not just just because somebody has a child or uh likes children doesn't really mean that they're qualified to give the child the kind of supervision and training that
sw4311B-ms98-a-0017 115.007625 117.014125 that uh
sw4311B-ms98-a-0018 117.014125 125.362750 [silence]
sw4311B-ms98-a-0019 125.362750 133.701250 exactly and that was the most difficult thing of all to find the the right people the qualified people
sw4311B-ms98-a-0020 133.701250 137.700500 [silence]
sw4311B-ms98-a-0021 137.700500 139.181875 oh
sw4311B-ms98-a-0022 139.181875 147.650125 [silence]
sw4311B-ms98-a-0023 147.650125 158.656750 oh exactly and the other thing that's difficult in uh an institutional setting like a day care center is to find the right program of enrichment
sw4311B-ms98-a-0024 158.656750 173.424375 for the child because_1 you don't wanna just warehouse the child and i didn't want to run an institution where that was the case where all we were doing were warehousing because the first four or five years are so important
sw4311B-ms98-a-0025 173.424375 182.684000 and you have to have the right kind of enrichment and that that includes uh an atmosphere in which the child is safe an[d]-
sw4311B-ms98-a-0026 182.684000 191.484875 and he's watched and his physical needs are cared for but also his uh developmental needs are cared for too
sw4311B-ms98-a-0027 191.484875 208.190750 [silence]
sw4311B-ms98-a-0028 208.190750 210.246750 that would be lovely
sw4311B-ms98-a-0029 210.246750 216.518125 [silence]
sw4311B-ms98-a-0030 216.518125 218.001875 um-hum
sw4311B-ms98-a-0031 218.001875 234.411250 [silence]
sw4311B-ms98-a-0032 234.411250 237.210875 well that's an interesting thought because
sw4311B-ms98-a-0033 237.210875 242.775375 [silence]
sw4311B-ms98-a-0034 242.775375 248.153375 that would be okay [laughter] that would that would help on the other end too
sw4311B-ms98-a-0035 248.153375 254.087250 in in terms of not warehousing people and letting people be productive for as long as they can be
sw4311B-ms98-a-0036 254.087250 263.474000 [silence]
sw4311B-ms98-a-0037 263.474000 265.005625 um-hum
sw4311B-ms98-a-0038 265.005625 269.922000 [silence]
sw4311B-ms98-a-0039 269.922000 272.028875 that's exactly right [vocalized-noise]
sw4311B-ms98-a-0040 272.028875 283.757750 [silence]
sw4311B-ms98-a-0041 283.757750 285.242125 oh
sw4311B-ms98-a-0042 285.242125 296.866000 [silence]
