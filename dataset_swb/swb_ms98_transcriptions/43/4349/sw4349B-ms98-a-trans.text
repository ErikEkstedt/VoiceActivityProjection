sw4349B-ms98-a-0003 85.505375 88.525500 just to pack the bearings
sw4349B-ms98-a-0004 88.525500 104.412500 [silence]
sw4349B-ms98-a-0005 104.412500 105.987375 right
sw4349B-ms98-a-0006 105.987375 119.488125 [silence]
sw4349B-ms98-a-0007 119.488125 122.511625 right and they repacked the wheel bearings
sw4349B-ms98-a-0008 122.511625 173.954625 [silence]
sw4349B-ms98-a-0009 173.954625 179.807875 you know they've gotten to the point that where they don't weigh very much and the the surface material on the pads is so good
sw4349B-ms98-a-0010 179.807875 205.395000 [silence]
sw4349B-ms98-a-0011 205.395000 207.295500 right
sw4349B-ms98-a-0012 207.295500 208.917125 well
sw4349B-ms98-a-0013 208.917125 211.721500 it it sounds like you've had um
sw4349B-ms98-a-0014 211.721500 215.113500 some good experiences with that uh
sw4349B-ms98-a-0015 215.113500 218.752250 and my experiences have been kind of contrary to that
sw4349B-ms98-a-0016 218.752250 221.344750 um i
sw4349B-ms98-a-0017 221.344750 225.557750 i get a little more involved in the maintenance of my car and uh
sw4349B-ms98-a-0018 225.557750 231.933000 and in fact i have an eighty seven mustang with a 302 in it that i've uh beefed up a little bit
sw4349B-ms98-a-0019 231.933000 241.056625 and one of the things that i did was to change the pulley system on it to use under drive pulleys so that the engine doesn't have to turn the accessories and can
sw4349B-ms98-a-0020 241.056625 247.890875 use more of the power to the rear wheels um the only catch was the first set of under drive pulleys that i put on it were
sw4349B-ms98-a-0021 247.890875 252.221125 um not even cast aluminum they were just pressed aluminum
sw4349B-ms98-a-0022 252.221125 253.852250 [silence]
sw4349B-ms98-a-0023 253.852250 259.854750 well there's three there's three pulleys that you change you change the crank pulley and the alternator pulley
sw4349B-ms98-a-0024 259.854750 262.839625 and uh the water pump pulley
sw4349B-ms98-a-0025 262.839625 264.555250 so
sw4349B-ms98-a-0026 264.555250 269.570375 when i changed those over i put on these these pressed aluminum things
sw4349B-ms98-a-0027 269.570375 271.108500 and uh
sw4349B-ms98-a-0028 271.108500 274.754000 probably about_1 four months ago the water pump decided to go out
sw4349B-ms98-a-0029 274.754000 281.557000 so in the process of seizing the belt spun on the pulley and wore through the water pump pulley almost all the way
sw4349B-ms98-a-0030 281.557000 283.657625 but not far enough to notice
sw4349B-ms98-a-0031 283.657625 290.013250 so i was on my way to work one day and uh the water pump pulley split laterally in half
sw4349B-ms98-a-0032 290.013250 291.028750 [laughter]
sw4349B-ms98-a-0033 291.028750 299.074000 so there was a half a water pump pulley still attached to the water pump and the other half was kind of dangling off the end of the crank and uh so i
