sw4349A-ms98-a-0002 0.501000 6.820625 the last auto repair i had was i have a nineteen eighty four Nissan truck
sw4349A-ms98-a-0003 6.820625 12.407625 i had a a tune up done and i had the i had the brakes done on it
sw4349A-ms98-a-0004 12.407625 17.523125 and the the reason i did that was because i don't have a scope
sw4349A-ms98-a-0005 17.523125 20.752250 and it has eight spark plugs
sw4349A-ms98-a-0006 20.752250 26.133500 and it's hard to to get get at them_1 and plus
sw4349A-ms98-a-0007 26.133500 30.386625 the time [vocalized-noise] i just don't have time anymore um
sw4349A-ms98-a-0008 30.386625 31.524500 [silence]
sw4349A-ms98-a-0009 31.524500 35.075000 as far as maintenance tasks that i do myself
sw4349A-ms98-a-0010 35.075000 36.980125 [silence]
sw4349A-ms98-a-0011 36.980125 46.291375 i i usually change the oil and wash the air filter and i- i had an occasion to change the had to change the the battery once
sw4349A-ms98-a-0012 46.291375 47.991250 but
sw4349A-ms98-a-0013 47.991250 52.303625 the brakes i was really surprised with the brakes [noise] i wanted
sw4349A-ms98-a-0014 52.303625 66.667125 i do have the background i know what needs to be done and i know the the oil needs t[o]- should be changed re[gularly]- very regularly and all of the bearings and and and the lubri[cation]- lubrication system needs to kee[p]- be lubricated and
sw4349A-ms98-a-0015 66.667125 68.859750 [silence]
sw4349A-ms98-a-0016 68.859750 77.572750 so i- i stay on top of that [noise] but i- [noise] i wanted my front wheels i wanted the bearings packed
sw4349A-ms98-a-0017 77.572750 86.216625 and they wanted something like fifteen dollars uh up front or something like that or maybe it was thirty dollars to do it
sw4349A-ms98-a-0018 86.216625 94.320625 just to pack the bearings but what i found is that they had a brake job and they ch[anged]- i had them_1 another thing i- i let them_1 do sometimes is that
sw4349A-ms98-a-0019 94.320625 105.038750 i let them go through and let them tell me what let them do the diagnostics that's free okay and then i can decide whether i want them to do it or whether i can do it see
sw4349A-ms98-a-0020 105.038750 111.648500 and they told me that my my brake pads were [laughter-gosh] you know [laughter-seventy] percent still good you know
sw4349A-ms98-a-0021 111.648500 121.220500 but still it was cheaper in the long run and uh so i just got the the the brakes done and i thought that was a good deal and and plus
sw4349A-ms98-a-0022 121.220500 124.470125 and they we repacked the the wheel bearings yeah but
sw4349A-ms98-a-0023 124.470125 129.398875 i've i've had considerable experience i you might say i'm a me[chanic]-
sw4349A-ms98-a-0024 129.398875 137.449000 a good back yard mechanic and i you know i took auto shop in high school it's been a while back but i- i still have a pretty good feel for it
sw4349A-ms98-a-0025 137.449000 141.250375 but one thing i didn't know is that
sw4349A-ms98-a-0026 141.250375 142.483750 [silence]
sw4349A-ms98-a-0027 142.483750 147.295500 when i was messing around with cars and stuff and most of the cars i ha[d]- i had bigger cars
sw4349A-ms98-a-0028 147.295500 154.619875 and the brakes go out fairly rapidly on those but what i was surprised at is that on my little Nissan
sw4349A-ms98-a-0029 154.619875 159.654125 i bought the truck with about sixty thousand i have almost a hundred and ten
sw4349A-ms98-a-0030 159.654125 162.868000 so i drove on those brake pads
sw4349A-ms98-a-0031 162.868000 174.749000 for uh you know forty five thousand miles and there was hardly any wear to them_1 so those small little trucks and cars like that th[ey]- they just the longevity of the brake pads is really good
sw4349A-ms98-a-0032 174.749000 176.563500 [silence]
sw4349A-ms98-a-0033 176.563500 177.815250 ex[actly]- 
sw4349A-ms98-a-0034 177.815250 178.681750 [silence]
sw4349A-ms98-a-0035 178.681750 185.689750 exactly so i you know but i- i just did it anyway i like to st[ay]- i like to stay up on it you know like to st[ay]- kind of stay up on it then 
sw4349A-ms98-a-0036 185.689750 191.498125 if you go in like just about any point any you know point in time
sw4349A-ms98-a-0037 191.498125 193.498625 and pull my dip stick
sw4349A-ms98-a-0038 193.498625 203.586125 and pull it out and look at the oil the oil is you might say a a light golden brown you know it's not dirty i- i- i keep it that way because that's
sw4349A-ms98-a-0039 203.586125 207.332375 that is the key to the longevity so
sw4349A-ms98-a-0040 207.332375 208.915000 s[o]- so how
