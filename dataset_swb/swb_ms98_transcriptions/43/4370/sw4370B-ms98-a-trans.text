sw4370B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.938375 [noise]
sw4370B-ms98-a-0002 0.938375 19.165375 [silence]
sw4370B-ms98-a-0003 19.165375 30.674500 hm i certainly can't argue with that definitely does need some improvements uh and the lawyers can throw people out for no reason whatsoever just because_1 they want to
sw4370B-ms98-a-0004 30.674500 33.131125 [silence]
sw4370B-ms98-a-0005 33.131125 35.133625 i think it's
sw4370B-ms98-a-0006 35.133625 36.252625 [silence]
sw4370B-ms98-a-0007 36.252625 43.469875 it's four or five i can't remember which i was on a jury trial last year only i got kicked out
sw4370B-ms98-a-0008 43.469875 46.585000 as uh the last selection
sw4370B-ms98-a-0009 46.585000 49.119875 that the uh defense got
sw4370B-ms98-a-0010 49.119875 58.687875 [silence]
sw4370B-ms98-a-0011 58.687875 62.881375 hm [laughter] that uh
sw4370B-ms98-a-0012 62.881375 81.243625 [silence]
sw4370B-ms98-a-0013 81.243625 85.479000 right but it still has to be a group of your peers
sw4370B-ms98-a-0014 85.479000 86.809875 see
sw4370B-ms98-a-0015 86.809875 90.103125 so if it's your peers and you're not educated
sw4370B-ms98-a-0016 90.103125 92.015125 then
sw4370B-ms98-a-0017 92.015125 98.177000 you want you want a nincompoop jury because they'll sympathize with you a bit
sw4370B-ms98-a-0018 98.177000 107.101000 as well as hopefully being honest people and do their best to comply with the facts as they were presented to them so that's why the defense is there
sw4370B-ms98-a-0019 107.101000 120.131750 picking through them_1 whereas at the same time the uh the prosecutors sitting there picking through them because he wants somebody who will give him uh a guilty verdict if the facts warrant
sw4370B-ms98-a-0020 120.131750 127.390875 so uh i think the jury selection process is pretty neat but i don't think that the jury ought to be the ones picking the punishment
sw4370B-ms98-a-0021 127.390875 140.733625 afterwards i think that should be left up to people who have some knowledge in the subject and more knowledge than a jury would have i mean you're talking about the person's already been found guilty
sw4370B-ms98-a-0022 140.733625 153.871250 right and many times i've seen on trials they have on TV the jury -[w]ill make a recommendation as to leniency or as to the death penalty or whatever but i think that it should be up to the judge and the uh lawyers
sw4370B-ms98-a-0023 153.871250 157.335375 to make the decision as to what the actual penalty will be
sw4370B-ms98-a-0024 157.335375 166.588125 maybe just the judge because they're the people who know what the system is and what it's all about and believe in the system
sw4370B-ms98-a-0025 166.588125 172.721125 uh and i think that would provide a more fair sentencing procedure
sw4370B-ms98-a-0026 172.721125 173.776750 [silence]
sw4370B-ms98-a-0027 173.776750 180.892125 as opposed to an emotional sentencing procedure also may be a more consistent sentencing procedure
sw4370B-ms98-a-0028 180.892125 192.059000 [silence]
sw4370B-ms98-a-0029 192.059000 201.702375 well preceding criminal record according to the judicial process has nothing to do with the current crime
sw4370B-ms98-a-0030 201.702375 211.391250 but when it comes to uh sentencing for punishment of course if the person's never done anything bad before according to the judicial system
sw4370B-ms98-a-0031 211.391250 221.868375 then they're going to lean towards a slightly more lenient side and the jury's supposed to be notified of criminal records when it comes to sentencing by jury
sw4370B-ms98-a-0032 221.868375 230.265875 at least in California they're supposed to be not during the trial during the trial as to whether they're guilty or not has nothing to do with their background
sw4370B-ms98-a-0033 230.265875 234.125875 but when it comes to what kind of sentence you're going to lay down
sw4370B-ms98-a-0034 234.125875 237.379000 i think that uh that they should
sw4370B-ms98-a-0035 237.379000 242.944250 i don't i don't know that they always have because i never sat all the way through a jury trial they get too boring
sw4370B-ms98-a-0036 242.944250 248.460875 [silence]
sw4370B-ms98-a-0037 248.460875 257.901375 well if it's a second offense the punishment should certainly be more severe than a first offense because obviously the rehabilitation process did not work the first time
sw4370B-ms98-a-0038 257.901375 264.079625 so you got to give them_1 either more time in the system or a different process that'll hopefully work better
sw4370B-ms98-a-0039 264.079625 265.958625 [silence]
sw4370B-ms98-a-0040 265.958625 266.630125 uh
sw4370B-ms98-a-0041 266.630125 270.382250 when it comes down to things like alternative sentencing i'm all for that
sw4370B-ms98-a-0042 270.382250 282.636375 for uh small crimes infractions and misdemeanors or parking tickets or traffic tickets that have gone to warrant you give them the option of working off their time doing civil service sort of things
sw4370B-ms98-a-0043 282.636375 286.463125 [silence]
sw4370B-ms98-a-0044 286.463125 290.083125 i think those ought to be punished a whole lot worse than they are
sw4370B-ms98-a-0045 290.083125 291.473375 yeah
sw4370B-ms98-a-0046 291.473375 297.087000 well uh say embezzlement right you get a guy down the street
sw4370B-ms98-a-0047 297.087000 299.618000 who comes up uh carrying a kni[fe]-
