sw4319B-ms98-a-0002 3.831125 12.959250 uh pretty good actually i work for Hewlett Packard and they have uh a pretty good uh benefits package in fact they're they're kind of known
sw4319B-ms98-a-0003 12.959250 17.987625 uh for having good benefits the pay isn't fabulous although
sw4319B-ms98-a-0004 17.987625 29.376000 i saw a survey recently and i'm actually making just about as much as you know i'm m[aking]- making actually over average over the average for my career my experience and all that stuff which kind of surprised me so
sw4319B-ms98-a-0005 29.376000 32.340000 i've got a Bachelor's in electrical engineering so
sw4319B-ms98-a-0006 32.340000 35.330625 and i'm not like a hugely advanced degree or any of that stuff
sw4319B-ms98-a-0007 35.330625 44.298750 uh anyway the our benefits are pretty good we've got stock purchase program and a that that's pretty generous although you have to hold the stock for two years
sw4319B-ms98-a-0008 44.298750 54.412000 before you get the company contribution which is kind of a a pain but uh [noise] there's a four O one K plan uh for uh sheltering some taxable income
sw4319B-ms98-a-0009 54.412000 56.592500 uh there's
sw4319B-ms98-a-0010 56.592500 58.779625 i've been with them for seven years
sw4319B-ms98-a-0011 58.779625 67.502125 yeah and the best thing and a lot of the stuff the best thing is like four years or five years it's pretty soon you're completely vested in the retirement plan and everything
sw4319B-ms98-a-0012 67.502125 80.657625 so uh it's not too but there's full uh th[ere]- there's several medical plans to choose from uh that cover pretty much everything i don't get sick that often so i don't pay much of it but you know i pay five dollars every time i visit the the hospital
sw4319B-ms98-a-0013 80.657625 83.156875 that you know for a checkup or whatever
sw4319B-ms98-a-0014 83.156875 84.366500 um
sw4319B-ms98-a-0015 84.366500 88.325625 they don't cover eyes though and i i have contact lenses so that's kind of a pain
sw4319B-ms98-a-0016 88.325625 90.862750 but you know i i can live
sw4319B-ms98-a-0017 90.862750 91.999875 [silence]

sw4319B-ms98-a-0022 99.009875 103.453125 yeah yeah and and the dental plan is fabulous the dental plan i pay absolutely nothing
sw4319B-ms98-a-0023 103.453125 113.725375 because uh i i guess they would charge a little bit if there was some orthodontia or something for one of my dependents or something like that but that's not the case so i [laughter] guess nothing it's fabulous
