sw4319A-ms98-a-0040 128.471500 138.463000 than my my sort of quote real job does uh and benefits through the government are uh really uh [noise]
sw4319A-ms98-a-0041 138.463000 147.697625 they just uh they're not the greatest uh i before i i uh [noise] uh got my degree i'm uh c[omputer]- a computer scientist
sw4319A-ms98-a-0042 147.697625 155.868875 and before i got my degree i had uh done paralegal work for law firms here in Washington and uh
sw4319A-ms98-a-0043 155.868875 168.650625 at that time i was in gravy city uh the law firms [laughter] in this town are not you know for a long time were just rolling in the dough in the early eighties and uh benefits were just amazing and
sw4319A-ms98-a-0044 168.650625 182.251625 we had everything paid for and uh anyway with the government it's not uh quite that nice a deal uh but it's you know it's it's okay what we have to do is we have to pay uh about twenty percent of our
sw4319A-ms98-a-0045 182.251625 191.695375 uh uh our costs and it's deducted from our check each month and that sort of thing and the plans that are available to us uh range from kind of mediocre to really sweet
sw4319A-ms98-a-0046 191.695375 202.483500 and uh [noise] so i i think i'm actually involved in a relatively good p[lan]- plan at this point um but uh it could be better that's for sure and
sw4319A-ms98-a-0047 202.483500 207.691125 uh [noise] but you know there there are other things that you get when you work for the government i- uh
sw4319A-ms98-a-0048 207.691125 218.807125 in in terms of uh more relaxed atmosphere it's really nice to be for me anyway to be able to work in uh a research atmosphere uh where i don't have to uh
sw4319A-ms98-a-0049 218.807125 230.141125 uh you know worry about uh academics or anything like that and [noise] so i'm i'm really kind of happy about that end of of things it's uh
