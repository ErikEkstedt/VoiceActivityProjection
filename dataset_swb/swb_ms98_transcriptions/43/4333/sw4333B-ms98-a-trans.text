sw4333B-ms98-a-0003 5.787000 13.865625 well that's [laughter] that's a really hard question i do know that uh politicians always talking out of both sides of their mouths um
sw4333B-ms98-a-0004 13.865625 25.654000 [noise] i let's example uh o[ur]- our friend the President right now says no new taxes we should and especially if anything be cutting taxes now because of the recession and at the same time the budget he sent to Congress has
sw4333B-ms98-a-0005 25.654000 36.875125 tax and fee increases so uh i know the politicians uh aren't aren't straightforward now i[n]- in terms of economics i'm not it's hard hard to call it really is
sw4333B-ms98-a-0006 36.875125 63.393250 [silence]
sw4333B-ms98-a-0007 63.393250 65.564250 hm right [laughter]
sw4333B-ms98-a-0008 65.564250 72.776375 [noise]
sw4333B-ms98-a-0009 72.776375 74.673125 yes uh
sw4333B-ms98-a-0010 74.673125 106.601000 [silence]
sw4333B-ms98-a-0011 106.601000 120.040125 well yeah i'm not exactly sure uh about polio in particular i know we have a polio vaccine which will prevent somebody from getting polio i'm not sure if we know what to do in terms of curing somebody who has already gotten polio 
sw4333B-ms98-a-0012 120.040125 133.332750 [silence]
sw4333B-ms98-a-0013 133.332750 134.622000 right
sw4333B-ms98-a-0014 134.622000 147.849250 [silence]
sw4333B-ms98-a-0015 147.849250 159.334625 yeah it's it's it's funny because uh it was one of the things that Bush is been trying really hard to get ahold of is the line item veto where uh you know Congress is able to attach all kinds of
sw4333B-ms98-a-0016 159.334625 168.009500 uh funny amendments for individual uh c[ongressional]- congressional districts to the to the main budget proposals and
sw4333B-ms98-a-0017 168.009500 173.553625 the poor President has has to uh either accept or reject the whole thing
sw4333B-ms98-a-0018 173.553625 177.979375 [silence]
sw4333B-ms98-a-0019 177.979375 179.396375 uh
sw4333B-ms98-a-0020 179.396375 185.417375 i i think the line item veto is not not is not necessarily a bad thing assuming that the uh
sw4333B-ms98-a-0021 185.417375 194.883125 the the President uh uses it to get rid of uh this kind of waste on the other hand uh
sw4333B-ms98-a-0022 194.883125 200.861625 uh it it assumes that you have lots of confidence in your President not to veto important things
sw4333B-ms98-a-0023 200.861625 207.487250 [laughter] right and just to get rid of the unimportant things and whenever there's that kind of subjective judgment
sw4333B-ms98-a-0024 207.487250 216.942500 [noise] there's always going to be a dispute as to uh where the exa[ctly]- where the boundary between waste and and necessity is
sw4333B-ms98-a-0025 216.942500 227.829000 so i'm not i'm not sure that that that will help solve our problems but there definitely is is a problem with uh i forgot there's a political term for this stuff pork barrel or something
sw4333B-ms98-a-0026 227.829000 237.458750 uh pork barrel politics the[re]- the[re]- there has to be some way to do it i know state governors usually have line item vetos and uh
sw4333B-ms98-a-0027 237.458750 247.477250 we[ll]- i- i lived in Massachusetts for a while and uh when Dukakis vetoed certain things there was a big uproar and wasn't necessarily so popular
sw4333B-ms98-a-0028 247.477250 252.261000 [silence]
sw4333B-ms98-a-0029 252.261000 254.022000 but at least at the end
sw4333B-ms98-a-0030 254.022000 255.750500 [silence]
sw4333B-ms98-a-0031 255.750500 267.831375 yeah i- i- they were very good at first they were in very good financials at first and uh that's part of the reason he became a nominee is because things went so well and then of course the bottom fell out
sw4333B-ms98-a-0032 267.831375 289.741625 [silence]
sw4333B-ms98-a-0033 289.741625 299.618000 and spare the economy yeah it's really it's a hard balance it it definitely is even not for government even just say for a small business um i know some
