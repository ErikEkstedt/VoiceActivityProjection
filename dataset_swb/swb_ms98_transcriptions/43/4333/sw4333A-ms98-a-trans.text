sw4333A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 6.032875 [noise] Steve uh with the election year and whatnot coming up do you think we ought to cut taxes raise them or or or what do you think
sw4333A-ms98-a-0002 6.032875 35.565750 [silence]
sw4333A-ms98-a-0003 35.565750 37.168750 uh-huh
sw4333A-ms98-a-0004 37.168750 39.832250 see i never thought really it's uh [noise]
sw4333A-ms98-a-0005 39.832250 51.422500 i never really thought that that the the question really had to do whether or not we're paying too much or too little i i always thought that the the real question was is are we getting a reasonable return on on investment 
sw4333A-ms98-a-0006 51.422500 64.124750 for instance like Social Security tax or Soc[ial]- uh i mean that's that's tax we're paying money and and supposedly this money is going into some kind of fund so that when it comes our turn to retire the money will be there for us
sw4333A-ms98-a-0007 64.124750 72.774000 that's yeah i you know when i when i see that money taken out of my paycheck each each week i or each every other week i i really think that money's history 
sw4333A-ms98-a-0008 72.774000 80.305125 and you know so as far as return investment that's not that's nothing and we're not even going to get the exact same number of dollars back
sw4333A-ms98-a-0009 80.305125 92.962250 uh someone was telling me that there is a uh uh there's still an office in uh you know staffed with with people there and in DC that are researching to find a cure for polio
sw4333A-ms98-a-0010 92.962250 94.111375 [silence]
sw4333A-ms98-a-0011 94.111375 106.858875 which i may be wrong but i believe that the cure for polio is already founded but but supposedly once you have an office in DC or you know and and staff it with people it's really tough to close it down and and they just haven't yet
sw4333A-ms98-a-0012 106.858875 113.286250 [silence]
sw4333A-ms98-a-0013 113.286250 114.676000 uh-huh
sw4333A-ms98-a-0014 114.676000 119.418500 [silence]
sw4333A-ms98-a-0015 119.418500 126.025125 well that might be the difference i don't know uh the other thing that uh i remember seeing on TV lately is uh had to do with
sw4333A-ms98-a-0016 126.025125 133.711000 it's like seventy five percent of the historical sites in America are in the home districts of very powerful people politically
sw4333A-ms98-a-0017 133.711000 139.746000 that that histor[ical]- for some reason historical sites with you know the the full federal money and everything
sw4333A-ms98-a-0018 139.746000 147.521750 seem to appear as as almost as like political favors to to very strong politicians
sw4333A-ms98-a-0019 147.521750 164.513625 [silence]
sw4333A-ms98-a-0020 164.513625 166.050000 uh-huh
sw4333A-ms98-a-0021 166.050000 174.013750 [silence]
sw4333A-ms98-a-0022 174.013750 180.034250 so it sounds like you uh you think that that we'd be able to save some money by uh passing the line item veto
sw4333A-ms98-a-0023 180.034250 200.209250 [silence]
sw4333A-ms98-a-0024 200.209250 201.458250 yeah
sw4333A-ms98-a-0025 201.458250 209.484625 [silence]
sw4333A-ms98-a-0026 209.484625 210.945250 uh-huh
sw4333A-ms98-a-0027 210.945250 227.242625 [silence]
sw4333A-ms98-a-0028 227.242625 229.948750 yeah pork barrel politics
sw4333A-ms98-a-0029 229.948750 247.034875 [silence]
sw4333A-ms98-a-0030 247.034875 253.325625 yeah but Massachusetts wasn't when Dukakis was there anyway wasn't in that great shape financially
sw4333A-ms98-a-0031 253.325625 257.210625 uh-huh i mean i don't know i
sw4333A-ms98-a-0032 257.210625 266.910250 [silence]
sw4333A-ms98-a-0033 266.910250 269.898625 [laughter]
sw4333A-ms98-a-0034 269.898625 281.559750 it's uh i mean it's it's tough i mean there's there's two ways you can kind of go to get out of tough financial situations i guess you can like raise taxes and then create like job programs and whatnot
sw4333A-ms98-a-0035 281.559750 290.529375 or you can hope that if people keep their money that they'll spend more and create jobs and and whatnot
sw4333A-ms98-a-0036 290.529375 299.618000 [silence]
