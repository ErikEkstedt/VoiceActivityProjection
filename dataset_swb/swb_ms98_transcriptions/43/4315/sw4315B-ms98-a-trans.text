sw4315B-ms98-a-0010 36.786375 43.300375 uh i think it's i think it's more for the families more than anything the families probably get some justification out of it
sw4315B-ms98-a-0011 43.300375 47.939750 but uh as far as it deterring anybody from committing murder or something like that i don't think it really does

sw4315B-ms98-a-0029 111.001250 120.871250 yeah yes i am i am in favor of it but as far as it being an actual deterrent to crime i don't think it is like i said it's mostly for the families benefit i think or the victims
sw4315B-ms98-a-0030 120.871250 123.609500 uh th[e]- you know the family of the victims

sw4315B-ms98-a-0041 174.198500 178.320250 well that is the bad thing about it and i'm i'm sure that back in the old days they
sw4315B-ms98-a-0042 178.320250 189.513375 they put to death a couple innocent ones during the process but they're but they're uh opinion was well if you got few few innocent people have to die to protect the majority then that's okay you [laughter-know] i don't i don't necessarily agree with that
sw4315B-ms98-a-0043 189.513375 193.512875 [silence]
sw4315B-ms98-a-0044 193.512875 196.859500 it screwed up the whole thing in my opinion yeah i agree with you there
sw4315B-ms98-a-0045 196.859500 203.226125 [silence]
sw4315B-ms98-a-0046 203.226125 205.846750 that's pretty obvious that's open and shut isn't it
sw4315B-ms98-a-0047 205.846750 209.558500 [silence]
sw4315B-ms98-a-0048 209.558500 210.920625 that's right

sw4315B-ms98-a-0052 215.616250 216.983500 right
sw4315B-ms98-a-0053 216.983500 218.487500 now
sw4315B-ms98-a-0054 218.487500 221.680375 in his case now is that that's Minnesota right
sw4315B-ms98-a-0055 221.680375 223.676125 is that Minnesota
sw4315B-ms98-a-0056 223.676125 226.212375 or Wisconsin or ah maybe it's Wis[consin]-
sw4315B-ms98-a-0057 226.212375 236.029375 yeah they they might have capital punishment the thing with people like that they like to take and study them_1 put them_1 in jail and do studies on them like that so that's they can try to get a profile of his personality i think
sw4315B-ms98-a-0058 236.029375 237.364875 you know and
sw4315B-ms98-a-0059 237.364875 246.642875 i guess in states where they don't have capital punishment that's the kind of stuff they do but i think in his case they will put him to death because_1 all the all the kids you know all the families and stuff aren't going to tolerate it
sw4315B-ms98-a-0060 246.642875 251.598375 [silence]
sw4315B-ms98-a-0061 251.598375 254.798000 what is the final uh is he still going to trial for that
sw4315B-ms98-a-0062 254.798000 260.114500 [silence]
sw4315B-ms98-a-0063 260.114500 265.316125 that's right because_1 he's definitely insane i think they proved that he was insane and maybe that's
sw4315B-ms98-a-0064 265.316125 273.213250 maybe that was uh what got him off or made him uh not get the death penalty because_1 they can prove that he's insane then i- i don't think you get the death penalty
sw4315B-ms98-a-0065 273.213250 276.955250 but the the but the uh prosecution was trying to uh
sw4315B-ms98-a-0066 276.955250 287.203500 say that he was sane when he committed them_1 so they could but they they were going for the death penalty i think that's what they were trying to uh i mean the they knew he did it that he was guilty it was just a matter of was he going to get the death penalty or life in prison
sw4315B-ms98-a-0067 287.203500 290.305750 yeah i think the families wanted him to get death [laughter]
sw4315B-ms98-a-0068 290.305750 298.850000 [silence]
