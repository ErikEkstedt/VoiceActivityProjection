sw4315A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.279625 [noise]
sw4315A-ms98-a-0002 0.279625 3.996375 so David uh what are the capital punishment laws down in the state of Florida
sw4315A-ms98-a-0003 3.996375 7.968000 [silence]
sw4315A-ms98-a-0004 7.968000 9.474875 oh that's right
sw4315A-ms98-a-0005 9.474875 11.747750 [silence]
sw4315A-ms98-a-0006 11.747750 13.973375 oh so the laws are still intact then
sw4315A-ms98-a-0007 13.973375 23.245625 [silence]
sw4315A-ms98-a-0008 23.245625 24.795125 um-hum
sw4315A-ms98-a-0009 24.795125 27.971625 and i imagine that costs a small bundle too
sw4315A-ms98-a-0010 27.971625 28.992250 [silence]
sw4315A-ms98-a-0011 28.992250 30.907250 go through the court process
sw4315A-ms98-a-0012 30.907250 39.735875 [silence]
sw4315A-ms98-a-0013 39.735875 41.053375 um-hum
sw4315A-ms98-a-0014 41.053375 48.557750 [silence]
sw4315A-ms98-a-0015 48.557750 58.062125 no but i think it does serve a valuable purpose in the sense that the victims get some sort of satisfaction the community doesn't pay for the burden of having a
sw4315A-ms98-a-0016 58.062125 60.515500 a prisoner in jail for twenty years
sw4315A-ms98-a-0017 60.515500 61.516375 [silence]
sw4315A-ms98-a-0018 61.516375 65.072500 you know and having to supply them with a color TV and
sw4315A-ms98-a-0019 65.072500 68.833500 um books and education so forth
sw4315A-ms98-a-0020 68.833500 75.123500 [silence]
sw4315A-ms98-a-0021 75.123500 77.687750 and i imagine it probably costs
sw4315A-ms98-a-0022 77.687750 83.139625 a great deal amount of money to to even go through the process of trying to electrocute someone
sw4315A-ms98-a-0023 83.139625 88.000500 to the court [proceum/processing] i mean it tying up attorney's t[ime]- uh times the court system
sw4315A-ms98-a-0024 88.000500 102.609250 [silence]
sw4315A-ms98-a-0025 102.609250 103.849125 um-hum
sw4315A-ms98-a-0026 103.849125 107.348875 [silence]
sw4315A-ms98-a-0027 107.348875 109.588000 well how do you feel about that do you
sw4315A-ms98-a-0028 109.588000 112.098125 are you in favor of capital punishment as a
sw4315A-ms98-a-0029 112.098125 113.578500 [silence]
sw4315A-ms98-a-0030 113.578500 114.880000 um-hum
sw4315A-ms98-a-0031 114.880000 124.990250 [silence]
sw4315A-ms98-a-0032 124.990250 126.452000 yeah i'm from New Hampshire
sw4315A-ms98-a-0033 126.452000 127.520500 [silence]
sw4315A-ms98-a-0034 127.520500 131.657375 yeah as far as i remember we don't have it um
sw4315A-ms98-a-0035 131.657375 138.893500 i know there hasn't been anyone executed up here probably in about thirty forty years which is ironic because we come from very conservative state
sw4315A-ms98-a-0036 138.893500 142.958000 uh very strong on on punishment and crime
sw4315A-ms98-a-0037 142.958000 152.499125 um it uh dur[ing]- one thing we don't really have th[at]- that much crime up here when we do have a celebrated case like Pamela Smart i don't know if you heard about that
sw4315A-ms98-a-0038 152.499125 154.070625 right
sw4315A-ms98-a-0039 154.070625 155.122375 [silence]
sw4315A-ms98-a-0040 155.122375 160.006000 yeah that's a case where um she's probably guilty
sw4315A-ms98-a-0041 160.006000 165.209875 i don't think there's enough evidence there to convict her i mean to uh
sw4315A-ms98-a-0042 165.209875 166.786500 execute her
sw4315A-ms98-a-0043 166.786500 175.433250 i think if because_1 once you execute some[one]- the the the dec[ision]- the decision is final you can't really reverse the [laughter-process] um
sw4315A-ms98-a-0044 175.433250 186.396375 [silence]
sw4315A-ms98-a-0045 186.396375 187.601750 um-hum
sw4315A-ms98-a-0046 187.601750 188.640000 [silence]
sw4315A-ms98-a-0047 188.640000 191.174000 yeah i don't agree with that either i think if you
sw4315A-ms98-a-0048 191.174000 194.783750 kill someone who's innocent that's uh
sw4315A-ms98-a-0049 194.783750 196.527375 [silence]
sw4315A-ms98-a-0050 196.527375 198.774125 somebody you can't even live with if they
sw4315A-ms98-a-0051 198.774125 199.782750 [silence]
sw4315A-ms98-a-0052 199.782750 204.372125 y[ou]- you really need t[o]- you know case where John Hinkley tried to assassinate the President uh
sw4315A-ms98-a-0053 204.372125 205.403125 [silence]
sw4315A-ms98-a-0054 205.403125 210.303250 right and if he had succeeded uh uh without a doubt he should be e[xecuted]- executed
sw4315A-ms98-a-0055 210.303250 212.416125 uh whether he's insane or not
sw4315A-ms98-a-0056 212.416125 216.465125 same thing with Dahlmer i mean he killed seventeen people
sw4315A-ms98-a-0057 216.465125 219.393250 uh i[t's]- it's a shame that we're gonna have to pay for him
sw4315A-ms98-a-0058 219.393250 221.326625 [silence]
sw4315A-ms98-a-0059 221.326625 222.547750 what's that
sw4315A-ms98-a-0060 222.547750 226.713000 i think [vocalized-noise] uh Michigan or some[where]- somewhere around there
sw4315A-ms98-a-0061 226.713000 245.937500 [silence]
sw4315A-ms98-a-0062 245.937500 248.981250 yeah but i thought he he received his s[entence]- um
sw4315A-ms98-a-0063 248.981250 252.526750 [vocalized-noise] remember maybe what the what the final turnout was
sw4315A-ms98-a-0064 252.526750 253.797000 [silence]
sw4315A-ms98-a-0065 253.797000 257.866750 i thought he went to re[habilitation]- rehabilitation mean they they were going to put him in
sw4315A-ms98-a-0066 257.866750 260.947500 rehabilitation for a few years then prison for the rest of his life
sw4315A-ms98-a-0067 260.947500 280.519375 [silence]
sw4315A-ms98-a-0068 280.519375 281.738125 um-hum
sw4315A-ms98-a-0069 281.738125 289.579625 [silence]
sw4315A-ms98-a-0070 289.579625 297.849625 yeah i think that's a a case where there really needs to be some change in the laws to allow for flexibility i think if one person kills another person out of
sw4315A-ms98-a-0071 297.849625 298.850000 [silence]
