sw4352A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 14.046750 [noise] i'm i'm a student at in college right now so i'm not really in the market for a car i have one though i bought this past summer a used car which i you know hope it will last me for a while um but uh i guess
sw4352A-ms98-a-0002 14.046750 19.128000 it it fits my needs pretty well it's a um a Ford uh Tempo
sw4352A-ms98-a-0003 19.128000 31.364750 and uh it's sort of you know nice car not not really you know huge and and a tank but uh big enough so that you can fit people in the backseat so you know it's nice when i go places with other people
sw4352A-ms98-a-0004 31.364750 36.442125 uh and uh and there's sort of an ordinary car it seems fairly reliable
sw4352A-ms98-a-0005 36.442125 37.564000 how about_1 you
sw4352A-ms98-a-0006 37.564000 45.302125 [silence]
sw4352A-ms98-a-0007 45.302125 46.212375 oh
sw4352A-ms98-a-0008 46.212375 60.486000 [silence]
sw4352A-ms98-a-0009 60.486000 61.719250 [laughter]
sw4352A-ms98-a-0010 61.719250 66.017125 [silence]
sw4352A-ms98-a-0011 66.017125 71.834125 yeah they're they're pretty nice they're kind of sporty right i if i have the right thing pictured yeah
sw4352A-ms98-a-0012 71.834125 75.474250 [noise] if i- i suppose if i was going out and buying a new car i might
sw4352A-ms98-a-0013 75.474250 78.822000 [noise] possibly buy something like that um
sw4352A-ms98-a-0014 78.822000 87.752375 but you know i'm i'm pretty happy with what i have now as i said [noise] the other the other kind of thing a friend of mine just got a new car got a Ford Explorer
sw4352A-ms98-a-0015 87.752375 96.786500 [noise] and they're kind of neat cars although they have their draw backs i mean they're they're you know they're kind of big and whatever but uh when it comes to sort of um
sw4352A-ms98-a-0016 96.786500 107.821875 you know moving stuff around which i find myself doing fair amounts since i tend to sort of move [laughter-about] twice a year at this point um that kind of th[ing]- thing would be very handy um 
sw4352A-ms98-a-0017 107.821875 117.069250 but uh yeah i don't again i don't really have any uh you know strong preferences when i bought my car uh you know the major criteria was that it uh
sw4352A-ms98-a-0018 117.069250 122.155875 you know be something that was rated fairly good for reliability um
sw4352A-ms98-a-0019 122.155875 127.240875 and uh you know not too expensive and you know decent looking but uh
sw4352A-ms98-a-0020 127.240875 140.538875 and i- i ended up getting a a pretty good deal on the car i got and i'm i'm very [laughter] happy with it it's not it's not you know i suppose if i'd the maximum reliability i would've gotten from a Japanese car but um they also sell for much more especially used
sw4352A-ms98-a-0021 140.538875 148.297500 and i sort of decided that it probably wasn't worth the price difference but uh you know even if i did occasionally spend a little more for repairs
sw4352A-ms98-a-0022 148.297500 155.360625 but uh it would probably work out now buying it new i don't know if that's true uh you know it probably isn't worth it more hm
sw4352A-ms98-a-0023 155.360625 156.782500 [silence]
sw4352A-ms98-a-0024 156.782500 166.122250 no i didn't that's a Ford yeah i didn't i mean i- i would say they probably are a little bit more reliable but at least on the used car market i think that's uh
sw4352A-ms98-a-0025 166.122250 173.983625 that's [laughter-factored] into the price already and i don't i'm not i don't think it's worth the added price you pay i mean if you're going for like um
sw4352A-ms98-a-0026 173.983625 182.408125 you know say a a you know five year old car um gi[ven]- with for given amount of mileage the Japanese car'll be
sw4352A-ms98-a-0027 182.408125 191.484625 going for a lot more money generally yeah and especially this one thing i was kind of appalled at is people would be selling uh
sw4352A-ms98-a-0028 191.484625 203.783500 Japanese cars for you know that had say a hundred thousand miles on them and they'd be asking for a lot of money for them like not much less money than i found say the equivalent Japanese car for with fifty thousand miles on it or something
sw4352A-ms98-a-0029 203.783500 208.123500 and you know people would say well you know i mean they last forever and whatever but i
sw4352A-ms98-a-0030 208.123500 212.822125 i mean i have to be a little bit skeptical i mean maybe it's true but hm
sw4352A-ms98-a-0031 212.822125 214.361500 yeah i mean any
sw4352A-ms98-a-0032 214.361500 215.406125 [silence]
sw4352A-ms98-a-0033 215.406125 228.965250 yeah i mean any any car wears out eventually and starts to have problems so i- i knew that you know i definitely i definitely wasn't gonna buy something with you know eighty or a hundred thousand miles on it uh if i could avoid it so uh
sw4352A-ms98-a-0034 228.965250 230.592875 [silence]
sw4352A-ms98-a-0035 230.592875 232.430875 really i'm surprised
sw4352A-ms98-a-0036 232.430875 235.237750 [silence]
sw4352A-ms98-a-0037 235.237750 237.818250 oh okay well that's [laughter-see] [laughter-yeah] that's
sw4352A-ms98-a-0038 237.818250 239.641250 [noise]
sw4352A-ms98-a-0039 239.641250 246.086500 yeah i've heard is it the Hondas where you have to replace the timing chain or the valves can get damaged or something like that
sw4352A-ms98-a-0040 246.086500 247.611500 it's one of the
sw4352A-ms98-a-0041 247.611500 252.873125 [silence]
sw4352A-ms98-a-0042 252.873125 257.946500 did yours actually fail on you or did you have it replaced as sort of a preemptive
sw4352A-ms98-a-0043 257.946500 263.022250 [silence]
sw4352A-ms98-a-0044 263.022250 264.153750 hm
sw4352A-ms98-a-0045 264.153750 265.307000 [silence]
sw4352A-ms98-a-0046 265.307000 266.322375 okay
sw4352A-ms98-a-0047 266.322375 269.056125 [silence]
sw4352A-ms98-a-0048 269.056125 274.052500 yeah i think yeah i kin[d]- i think i remember it hearing that either the Hondas or the Toyotas um
sw4352A-ms98-a-0049 274.052500 276.623875 that if the timing belt went
sw4352A-ms98-a-0050 276.623875 288.704625 in in under like circumstances you know i guess would it'd be while the car was running and maybe some you know certain speeds or whatever that it could cause the uh cause fairly serious engine damage
sw4352A-ms98-a-0051 288.704625 292.290750 i could be wrong about that it is something i just vaguely remember hearing
sw4352A-ms98-a-0052 292.290750 298.850000 um yeah but i- i could be wrong about that but yeah i mean i would say in general you know probably although it's
