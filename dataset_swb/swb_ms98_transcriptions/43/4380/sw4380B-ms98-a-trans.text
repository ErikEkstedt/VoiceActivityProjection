sw4380B-ms98-a-0011 31.911875 35.430500 i've the high school i went to was uh
sw4380B-ms98-a-0012 35.430500 46.655375 was a good one also and i well i guess you could say one of the problems with the public education system is the disparity between different schools because_1 the one i went to was you know
sw4380B-ms98-a-0013 46.655375 52.953375 i'm sure a a lot nicer than you know a lot of the inner city schools and the things around Atlanta

sw4380B-ms98-a-0021 81.002125 84.964375 yeah and i'm also i mean in the in those places where uh
sw4380B-ms98-a-0022 84.964375 97.062250 like the economy is really bad they might you know be more tempted to to quit school and get jobs and that kind of thing because they need the you know money to put food on the table and stuff like that more than they would you know in areas where they
sw4380B-ms98-a-0023 97.062250 98.534125 [noise] yeah

sw4380B-ms98-a-0033 140.976000 143.260000 that's hard for me to say since i didn't
sw4380B-ms98-a-0034 143.260000 153.591625 i didn't really grow well when i went to elementary school it it it wasn't in a great area but i still i mean i learned to read started learning to read when i was in kindergarten you know so i guess i can't really
sw4380B-ms98-a-0035 153.591625 158.771500 i can't say what it would be like to uh grow up in a really oppressed uh region
sw4380B-ms98-a-0036 158.771500 168.472750 [noise] you know i guess the whole the whole environment and attitude towards school and learning is different for the for those people

sw4380B-ms98-a-0040 173.707500 177.775625 so i guess the problem is the the thing to do is to try to
sw4380B-ms98-a-0041 177.775625 180.963625 i don't get some kind of motivation to learn and

sw4380B-ms98-a-0054 219.808125 228.809500 that compare a public education to a private education i mean within like within the same uh income groups
sw4380B-ms98-a-0055 228.809500 236.033250 if you compare the like the people that could have that could have sent their kids to private schools and the people that you know the people that uh

sw4380B-ms98-a-0061 253.217250 267.246750 once once it seemed i got into high school they had a lot of uh acc[elerated]- accelerated programs and all kinds of stuff like that and that mean tha[t]- that makes a big difference because_1 uh when you're when you're taking classes with uh
