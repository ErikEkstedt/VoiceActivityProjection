sw4380A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 3.316875 [noise] recently graduated from high school meaning like uh you know
sw4380A-ms98-a-0002 3.316875 7.524000 three or four years ago i'm a senior in in uh college now and uh
sw4380A-ms98-a-0003 7.524000 15.642000 i can't really talk too much [laughter-about] the problems with uh public education in detail because the school system i went to was
sw4380A-ms98-a-0004 15.642000 21.006375 uh really superb even though it was a public school system
sw4380A-ms98-a-0005 21.006375 22.659625 [silence]
sw4380A-ms98-a-0006 22.659625 23.779250 oh okay
sw4380A-ms98-a-0007 23.779250 24.880750 [silence]
sw4380A-ms98-a-0008 24.880750 25.915125 yeah
sw4380A-ms98-a-0009 25.915125 30.631750 i got a friend who goes there by the way [laughter-i] [laughter-wanted] to as[k]- talk to you about that afterward okay
sw4380A-ms98-a-0010 30.631750 50.307375 [silence]
sw4380A-ms98-a-0011 50.307375 51.594000 yeah
sw4380A-ms98-a-0012 51.594000 58.705875 yeah it was a a it's a more or less a suburban school system yes that's that was true for mine too um
sw4380A-ms98-a-0013 58.705875 68.320750 although i [noise] i'm sure to some extent that money is part of the problem in the disparity but i don't think i honestly don't think that's the biggest part of it
sw4380A-ms98-a-0014 68.320750 76.515375 you know i think that uh i mean i know that in my town you know most of the most of the parents they're valued education and uh
sw4380A-ms98-a-0015 76.515375 82.627875 you know and so the students were you know to some extent motivated to learn [laughter-i] [laughter-mean] [laughter-you] [laughter-know]
sw4380A-ms98-a-0016 82.627875 97.026125 [silence]
sw4380A-ms98-a-0017 97.026125 104.394750 yeah that's true but [noise] but uh i think i mean even more than that even i mean if you drop out in high school
sw4380A-ms98-a-0018 104.394750 114.140375 you should still be able to read [laughter-you] [laughter-know] which it s[ounds]- i mean it sounds like uh now i think maybe it jus[t]- started changing in the past few years because uh
sw4380A-ms98-a-0019 114.140375 120.455625 they have more of these um sort of mandatory -[manda]tory tests you have to take before you get a diploma but uh
sw4380A-ms98-a-0020 120.455625 130.758375 but uh certainly before that there are people that you know like would graduate from high school and could barely read um and that's just sort of inexcusable and you can't really
sw4380A-ms98-a-0021 130.758375 134.237250 i- i- i mean i just can't even picture how that could happen
sw4380A-ms98-a-0022 134.237250 141.448500 you know except maybe to someone whose you know really badly learning uh disabled or something but these people [laughter-obviously] weren't
sw4380A-ms98-a-0023 141.448500 143.107750 [silence]
sw4380A-ms98-a-0024 143.107750 143.812000 [noise]

sw4380A-ms98-a-0026 151.367500 153.099750 yeah
sw4380A-ms98-a-0027 153.099750 154.664875 yeah
sw4380A-ms98-a-0028 154.664875 158.817875 [silence]
sw4380A-ms98-a-0029 158.817875 160.110625 yeah
sw4380A-ms98-a-0030 160.110625 166.938375 [silence]
sw4380A-ms98-a-0031 166.938375 173.137875 yeah i mean i think that's almost a bigger factor than anything else probably i mean i don't i think
sw4380A-ms98-a-0032 173.137875 175.340875 you know if people just
sw4380A-ms98-a-0033 175.340875 180.676250 [silence]
sw4380A-ms98-a-0034 180.676250 187.464500 yeah and again i don't i mean again i don't know that i'm you know how qualified i mean i think it'd be interesting
sw4380A-ms98-a-0035 187.464500 191.885000 to you know to spend a couple of days just looking around an inner city school
sw4380A-ms98-a-0036 191.885000 200.511250 uh you know sort of sort of maybe from elementary through uh high school you know just sort of to get a feel for what it's like
sw4380A-ms98-a-0037 200.511250 205.150625 i think that would be an interesting experience but uh i haven't done that
sw4380A-ms98-a-0038 205.150625 207.533375 [silence]
sw4380A-ms98-a-0039 207.533375 208.833000 [noise]
sw4380A-ms98-a-0040 208.833000 216.440500 but i do i do think that um i mean public education in general i think can work and i think it's a good thing
sw4380A-ms98-a-0041 216.440500 227.993000 [silence]
sw4380A-ms98-a-0042 227.993000 229.224125 yeah
sw4380A-ms98-a-0043 229.224125 237.922125 [silence]
sw4380A-ms98-a-0044 237.922125 239.094750 yeah
sw4380A-ms98-a-0045 239.094750 240.748750 [silence]
sw4380A-ms98-a-0046 240.748750 249.141625 yeah yeah i mean i do[n't]- i honestly don't really think i could have you know done much better than i did in the school system i was in you know i mean it's
sw4380A-ms98-a-0047 249.141625 259.030125 [silence]
sw4380A-ms98-a-0048 259.030125 260.194000 yeah
sw4380A-ms98-a-0049 260.194000 270.474875 [silence]
sw4380A-ms98-a-0050 270.474875 273.227000 [noise] yeah i mean and in the
sw4380A-ms98-a-0051 273.227000 284.197875 once you book junior high uh start junior high starting in eighth grade all the way through high school there were four levels
sw4380A-ms98-a-0052 284.197875 293.626750 y[ou]- well no i guess it wa[s]- in junior high it was still three then in high school it changed into four levels of uh of instruction in the major subjects
sw4380A-ms98-a-0053 293.626750 299.618000 uh which i mean actually i think that works pretty well i mean that that ma[kes]-
