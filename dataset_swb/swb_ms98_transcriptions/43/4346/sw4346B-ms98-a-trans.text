sw4346B-ms98-a-0013 63.992125 72.888625 well yeah it it's it's pretty much what i was [vocalized-noise] going to say is there's a lot of disparity between different neighborhoods and what sort of schools go in
sw4346B-ms98-a-0014 72.888625 78.870625 um i grew up in New York and um the place or not New York City upstate New York
sw4346B-ms98-a-0015 78.870625 87.181500 and i went to uh the City of Rochester School District and s[o]- a lot of my friends were in one of the neighboring suburbs
sw4346B-ms98-a-0016 87.181500 93.115625 and it wasn't we weren't too far removed geographically from each other but
sw4346B-ms98-a-0017 93.115625 103.828500 the difference in schools i think was pretty substantial and uh one of the things that probably would have been better if is if the entire county had had had just one school system
sw4346B-ms98-a-0018 103.828500 113.588875 and that would result in some um could result in more equitable distribution of money because what was happening was you know all the very rich people went out to the move out to the suburbs
sw4346B-ms98-a-0019 113.588875 120.039500 and the city had a very low tax base so they didn't have a lot of money to work with
sw4346B-ms98-a-0020 120.039500 133.570375 as a result the schools were rundown there wasn't as many you know the nice supplies in science class that we would have liked there wasn't as many advanced placement courses uh when i was a senior as some other schools had
sw4346B-ms98-a-0021 133.570375 144.652125 [noise] and uh it it so i you know i think that one of the things one of the ways to to to help schools in general uh and get them all to a minimum level of
sw4346B-ms98-a-0022 144.652125 157.894375 of of competency almost would be to expand the size of school districts so you get a wider variety of people and the the problem with that is then then then people will either the rich people will either pull their kids out of the public school and put them in private schools
sw4346B-ms98-a-0023 157.894375 166.552625 or they'll move farther away [laughter] to get better schools so you know it it's kind of you end up chasing like a dog chasing its own tail sort of

sw4346B-ms98-a-0044 270.859375 280.241875 yeah yeah [noise] yeah i know that that that was a big factor for me i ended up coming out of of the public school system very well you know with very good education
sw4346B-ms98-a-0045 280.241875 291.021125 i ended up getting some scholarships to go to college and which has been you know which is really nice and i think the difference for me was that my parents were
sw4346B-ms98-a-0046 291.021125 297.314000 you know they were definitely they were always there was like well yeah of course you're going to study and do well i mean that's the way of course are you know
