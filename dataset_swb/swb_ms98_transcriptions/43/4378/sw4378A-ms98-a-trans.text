sw4378A-ms98-a-0011 31.986750 35.517000 [noise] two summers ago i went to Massachusetts
sw4378A-ms98-a-0012 35.517000 41.321125 and i went with a friend of mine and we undertook a building house
sw4378A-ms98-a-0013 41.321125 52.942375 and this was um a Lincoln log house where you have the wall partitions and it's preconstructed you might say
sw4378A-ms98-a-0014 52.942375 56.429875 and we started in um
sw4378A-ms98-a-0015 56.429875 71.210375 we started from an empty lot with um trees and stuff on it and we had to cut them_1 uh down and clear the lot we had to call in the [escavators/excavators] and have them dig the basement and pour the basement and um
sw4378A-ms98-a-0016 71.210375 75.071625 went from the ground up our
sw4378A-ms98-a-0017 75.071625 88.122250 one of our main problems was as well in Massachusetts i thought i was going to well it was a fun time but i thought gosh summer time you know well all it ever did was rain and [laughter-thunderstorms] and 
sw4378A-ms98-a-0018 88.122250 93.781875 [noise] one thing is that we're we had we were gonna pour the basement foundation
sw4378A-ms98-a-0019 93.781875 98.967250 and we're in the process and it started pouring down rain
sw4378A-ms98-a-0020 98.967250 107.668875 and i guess we had most of it done but the end result what happened was that
sw4378A-ms98-a-0021 107.668875 121.657125 some of the the wa[ter]- a lot of water settled on the top and it really didn't give a very good finish and some of the it was sort of sandy and and not um a very good finish
sw4378A-ms98-a-0022 121.657125 126.894250 but it turned it was okay and it's only the basement floor so it was okay
sw4378A-ms98-a-0023 126.894250 131.434875 but um it kept us pretty busy it was only um
sw4378A-ms98-a-0024 131.434875 138.086375 there was well me and my friend and then we just had like two helpers and uh sort of a
sw4378A-ms98-a-0025 138.086375 143.434125 a family type it wasn't you know like a commercial project just something that sort of just
