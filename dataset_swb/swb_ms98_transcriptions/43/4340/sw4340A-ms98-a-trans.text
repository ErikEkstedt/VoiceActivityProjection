sw4340A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.410750 [noise]
sw4340A-ms98-a-0002 0.410750 5.747125 what kind of crime do you think um is the most prevalent in our society
sw4340A-ms98-a-0003 5.747125 12.799250 [silence]
sw4340A-ms98-a-0004 12.799250 15.318125 such as New York City
sw4340A-ms98-a-0005 15.318125 16.946750 [laughter]
sw4340A-ms98-a-0006 16.946750 36.753625 [silence]
sw4340A-ms98-a-0007 36.753625 38.597875 yeah i i
sw4340A-ms98-a-0008 38.597875 49.146000 i wonder if um if drug use is a more prevalent crime though because i mean so many people use it and even though just using is not really
sw4340A-ms98-a-0009 49.146000 51.403375 i mean it is a crime
sw4340A-ms98-a-0010 51.403375 58.900000 [silence]
sw4340A-ms98-a-0011 58.900000 60.213875 well that's true
sw4340A-ms98-a-0012 60.213875 65.939000 but i was i i was s[taying]- staying in the realm of of felonies versus misdemeanors
sw4340A-ms98-a-0013 65.939000 71.552250 and uh drug use well actually drug use is probably a misdemeanor but
sw4340A-ms98-a-0014 71.552250 76.190875 um what kind what kind have you been uh
sw4340A-ms98-a-0015 76.190875 81.323375 have you been the subject of such a crime such as stealing or anything
sw4340A-ms98-a-0016 81.323375 89.083625 [silence]
sw4340A-ms98-a-0017 89.083625 94.200125 that that's not that much i mean you know those aren't i
sw4340A-ms98-a-0018 94.200125 101.343875 [silence]
sw4340A-ms98-a-0019 101.343875 106.105375 yeah i think it is i in some ways it's almost worse than murder
sw4340A-ms98-a-0020 106.105375 107.487875 um
sw4340A-ms98-a-0021 107.487875 112.087500 murder murder is is hard on the people that were related to
sw4340A-ms98-a-0022 112.087500 116.443750 b[ut]- you know i mean it is a rather final solution [laughter-though]
sw4340A-ms98-a-0023 116.443750 122.151625 [silence]
sw4340A-ms98-a-0024 122.151625 123.480375 yes
sw4340A-ms98-a-0025 123.480375 136.173375 what d[o]- what do you think is uh is an appropriate um punishment for some of the various you know such as things such as rape or or uh murder or something like that
sw4340A-ms98-a-0026 136.173375 141.179875 [silence]
sw4340A-ms98-a-0027 141.179875 143.010125 i agree with that
sw4340A-ms98-a-0028 143.010125 145.559500 [silence]
sw4340A-ms98-a-0029 145.559500 148.512875 yeah i think Virginia does too up here
sw4340A-ms98-a-0030 148.512875 157.162750 [silence]
sw4340A-ms98-a-0031 157.162750 160.820125 yeah i think the appeal process takes too long
sw4340A-ms98-a-0032 160.820125 169.148125 i think i i think it should take from conviction to execution should take no longer than a year
sw4340A-ms98-a-0033 169.148125 172.655625 [silence]
sw4340A-ms98-a-0034 172.655625 173.940750 um-hum
sw4340A-ms98-a-0035 173.940750 181.226000 [silence]
sw4340A-ms98-a-0036 181.226000 187.366750 well yeah i mean the system isn't perfect i mean it's run by a bunch of imperfect humans
sw4340A-ms98-a-0037 187.366750 194.838750 you do the best you can to make it perfect you know you you go out of your way to try real hard to make it perfect
sw4340A-ms98-a-0038 194.838750 198.329250 but i think you have to accept some of the errors
sw4340A-ms98-a-0039 198.329250 204.978250 i think that murder itself would decrease significantly if if there was a credible punishment
sw4340A-ms98-a-0040 204.978250 207.656000 um for murderers
sw4340A-ms98-a-0041 207.656000 219.354125 [silence]
sw4340A-ms98-a-0042 219.354125 224.156125 and society probably too i mean just general society to
sw4340A-ms98-a-0043 224.156125 225.510000 um
sw4340A-ms98-a-0044 225.510000 229.937125 yeah it does and and it decreases the prison population
sw4340A-ms98-a-0045 229.937125 232.610000 and which is significant i mean
sw4340A-ms98-a-0046 232.610000 234.882250 [silence]
sw4340A-ms98-a-0047 234.882250 236.287875 yeah
sw4340A-ms98-a-0048 236.287875 246.952750 [silence]
sw4340A-ms98-a-0049 246.952750 252.420250 yeah generally the crimes of passion and things like that um are not premeditated
sw4340A-ms98-a-0050 252.420250 258.483875 i mean they can be but usually they aren't they're spur of the moment and uh
sw4340A-ms98-a-0051 258.483875 265.428125 the premeditated murders the ones where the person plots and plans when you catch those
sw4340A-ms98-a-0052 265.428125 269.964375 those individuals i think that you you end up with a uh
sw4340A-ms98-a-0053 269.964375 271.625125 [silence]
sw4340A-ms98-a-0054 271.625125 283.185250 uh how do i want to you end up with a s[omeone]- you end up with someone who's more dangerous to society because they actually could harbor these thoughts for a long time
sw4340A-ms98-a-0055 283.185250 284.749500 [silence]
sw4340A-ms98-a-0056 284.749500 288.287250 yes they they would have no problems doing it again
sw4340A-ms98-a-0057 288.287250 289.312375 [silence]
sw4340A-ms98-a-0058 289.312375 300.610000 um-hum and i think locking them_1 up for you know fifty years doesn't do uh any good because as a as a taxpayer i'm going to pay you know one and a
