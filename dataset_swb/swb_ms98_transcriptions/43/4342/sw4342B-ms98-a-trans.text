sw4342B-ms98-a-0039 221.423500 224.989125 because_1 we don't get an awful lot of coverage in the Dallas Morning News
sw4342B-ms98-a-0040 224.989125 240.602000 [silence]
sw4342B-ms98-a-0041 240.602000 247.165875 now they have started here running a three day or three times a week Plano section
sw4342B-ms98-a-0042 247.165875 252.052500 and it's just sort of a you know four or five pages that covers what's going on in Plano
sw4342B-ms98-a-0043 252.052500 255.163125 but it's still not an awful lot of news

sw4342B-ms98-a-0048 283.547375 290.367125 of course they tend to cover the county and we're not in Dallas county so they tend to ignore places outside of the county
sw4342B-ms98-a-0049 290.367125 298.491750 [silence]
