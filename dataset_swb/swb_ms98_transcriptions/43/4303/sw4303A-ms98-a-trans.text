sw4303A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 4.084750 [noise] well um as far as the as far as spending goes
sw4303A-ms98-a-0002 4.084750 16.730625 the way um the way i see it in the in the last article i read was that i think US ought to spend the same amount of money that we're spending but i think the states need to take advantage of it more than they are
sw4303A-ms98-a-0003 16.730625 27.328875 because_1 i know the article i read stated that Texas had um what was it like eleven mi[llion]- not a million but like a hundred and ten thousand
sw4303A-ms98-a-0004 27.328875 32.634750 offered to it or more than that and it didn't take advantage of all the money that it was offered
sw4303A-ms98-a-0005 32.634750 37.321375 because the state that i'm in has is the fourth largest in AIDS cases
sw4303A-ms98-a-0006 37.321375 40.753875 and it's just not taking advantage of the money that's being provided

sw4303A-ms98-a-0039 234.972500 247.433000 a lot of a lot i mean this is a this is a a an a totally new experience we haven't come really ever come across at least not in my like time that you know where we've come across a disease that has spread this rapidly
sw4303A-ms98-a-0040 247.433000 257.060125 um and that we've you know is is changing i know just in the last three months the CDC has come back and redefined AIDS
sw4303A-ms98-a-0041 257.060125 262.988750 you know and so i mean it's it's very difficult to put a cure on something that you keep expanding
sw4303A-ms98-a-0042 262.988750 274.007500 and we kee[p]- you know and all the new um you know things that we keep finding you know that you can be HIV positive for you know now what have they bumped it up to eleven years now
