sw4303B-ms98-a-0007 40.330000 45.463625 i wasn't aware that there was a very large uh gay community in Texas
sw4303B-ms98-a-0008 45.463625 58.234875 [silence]
sw4303B-ms98-a-0009 58.234875 59.794125 interesting
sw4303B-ms98-a-0010 59.794125 73.255500 yeah and Atlanta is sort of the homosexual capital of the Southeast so we have quite a few cases here and of course we here a lot about it because the Centers for Disease Control is located here
sw4303B-ms98-a-0011 73.255500 78.428375 uh my feeling on the funding issue is uh
sw4303B-ms98-a-0012 78.428375 84.959875 uh p[roportion]- in proportion to the number of people who are dying of AIDS
sw4303B-ms98-a-0013 84.959875 91.342625 uh compared to uh other diseases like cancer and heart disease
sw4303B-ms98-a-0014 91.342625 97.958625 we're spending many many times more on AIDS research than we are for these other diseases
sw4303B-ms98-a-0015 97.958625 103.657000 and i think a lot of it's just due to political clout and pressure
sw4303B-ms98-a-0016 103.657000 105.699000 yeah
sw4303B-ms98-a-0017 105.699000 111.277875 [silence]
sw4303B-ms98-a-0018 111.277875 123.459875 that well yes that's true but also uh we haven't learned enough about cancer to be able to prevent it but it many ways AIDS is completely preventable through uh behavioral changes
sw4303B-ms98-a-0019 123.459875 137.857000 i do think that uh part of the reason that we haven't made as much progress in AIDS research and the reason we're spending so much money on it is that it's almost all of the research is in the hands of the government
sw4303B-ms98-a-0020 137.857000 145.317625 and we all know how efficient the government is uh the way i look at it is if uh
sw4303B-ms98-a-0021 145.317625 157.029750 if all the internal bickering between in Center for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health health uh over who's going to get credit for solving it were to be set aside
sw4303B-ms98-a-0022 157.029750 165.759125 and if private industry just through the profit motive more than anything else were set loose to go off and find uh
sw4303B-ms98-a-0023 165.759125 175.910875 a cure with the promise that they'd be able to get the financial rewards from it uh i feel that we'd find a cure really quick
sw4303B-ms98-a-0024 175.910875 182.280125 uh but as it is it's just being the whole program is just being mismanaged by bureaucrats
sw4303B-ms98-a-0025 182.280125 185.737000 uh and it's real disappointing uh
sw4303B-ms98-a-0026 185.737000 197.489500 you know so many of the other uh major advances that we have today are are done by private industry but for some reason in this case no one's really willing to give them a chance
sw4303B-ms98-a-0027 197.489500 201.943000 [silence]
sw4303B-ms98-a-0028 201.943000 203.203500 uh
sw4303B-ms98-a-0029 203.203500 212.072875 course you know i'm a big advocate of the free market anyway and uh it seems to me that so much of what the government gets involved in
sw4303B-ms98-a-0030 212.072875 214.084750 just just goes to pot
sw4303B-ms98-a-0031 214.084750 216.091500 uh but
sw4303B-ms98-a-0032 216.091500 217.469625 [silence]
sw4303B-ms98-a-0033 217.469625 218.710750 uh i
sw4303B-ms98-a-0034 218.710750 221.917500 uh i do want there to be a cure
sw4303B-ms98-a-0035 221.917500 223.373750 uh
sw4303B-ms98-a-0036 223.373750 224.773125 uh
sw4303B-ms98-a-0037 224.773125 230.969375 but like so many other things i think the w[ay]- just the way that we're going about it is not the best way
sw4303B-ms98-a-0038 230.969375 256.538125 [silence]
sw4303B-ms98-a-0039 256.538125 258.040000 sure 
sw4303B-ms98-a-0040 258.040000 273.342875 [silence]
sw4303B-ms98-a-0041 273.342875 275.329625 uh it's a long time
sw4303B-ms98-a-0042 275.329625 282.630875 and it's interesting that there are there do seem to be a lot of people who are HIV positive but who never get the disease
sw4303B-ms98-a-0043 282.630875 292.954500 and it seems to me that it's it's likely that there's some other uh it's not just the virus that causes it but it's something else in your body that the virus triggers
sw4303B-ms98-a-0044 292.954500 298.242000 uh that causes it and if they can find whatever that other that other trigg[er]-
