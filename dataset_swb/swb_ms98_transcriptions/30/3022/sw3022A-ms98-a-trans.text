sw3022A-ms98-a-0005 19.240875 33.543375 oh okay uh [noise] a friend of mine was just called before and uh it's amazing the that they have to go through about four hundred people to get a a jury [noise] for [noise] this one case 
sw3022A-ms98-a-0006 33.543375 39.504500 because um there was everybody seemed to have some sort of bias
sw3022A-ms98-a-0007 39.504500 51.119000 you know uh very hard to find um you know extremely um um yeah impartial people but anyway i think it would be interesting but um
sw3022A-ms98-a-0008 51.119000 54.313875 how do you what do you think about the way it's run

sw3022A-ms98-a-0016 80.139625 90.100000 yeah [laughter] that's true that's a good point um aren't they supposed to be unanimous though now isn't that the way it is okay
sw3022A-ms98-a-0017 90.100000 103.182625 yes i agree i do [vocalized-noise] although i do not know i think that the judge should be involved i re[ally]- at this point i am not sure how it works but let's say that a jury decides somebody is guilty 
sw3022A-ms98-a-0018 103.182625 105.386250 and the judge disagrees
sw3022A-ms98-a-0019 105.386250 109.590500 it it's not the judges final decision right it's the jury's
sw3022A-ms98-a-0020 109.590500 120.830875 see a[nd]- and my feeling is this judge knows a whole i do not know i mean that's his job you know that and and it seems like all he is is a medi[ator]- mediator of the whole thing 
sw3022A-ms98-a-0021 120.830875 126.587250 [silence]
sw3022A-ms98-a-0022 126.587250 130.813625 well that's true yep you're right there's crooked everybody
sw3022A-ms98-a-0023 130.813625 143.423250 it's really scary because you know you see i do not know if you ever watch saw the movie Presumed Innocent did you see that oh my God it's fabulous if you ever can rent it or something
sw3022A-ms98-a-0024 143.423250 157.445000 really it's just great and it it's scary because it's just about that there are crooked cops and the whole case points to this one guy and you know he is innocent and um
sw3022A-ms98-a-0025 157.445000 159.642875 [silence]
sw3022A-ms98-a-0026 159.642875 161.499375 yeah it does
sw3022A-ms98-a-0027 161.499375 168.676500 and then you watch this guy go to jail for um i should not be telling you because you are going to want to see it
sw3022A-ms98-a-0028 168.676500 172.803250 yeah and he goes to jail um
sw3022A-ms98-a-0029 172.803250 175.875125 and oh it's really scary
sw3022A-ms98-a-0030 175.875125 189.209375 yeah but but then i also see um oh i do not know this one case [vocalized-noise] here in Rochester where um we had a serial killer and they finally caught him and 
sw3022A-ms98-a-0031 189.209375 199.129625 it [vocalized-noise] here he the guy had basically admitted to killing twelve girls yeah unbelievable and um
sw3022A-ms98-a-0032 199.129625 209.052125 yet it was it was almost a type of thing where he almost wasn't guilty because they had this little flaw one piece of evidence
sw3022A-ms98-a-0033 209.052125 211.176125 uh [vocalized-noise] ah
sw3022A-ms98-a-0034 211.176125 212.576875 yeah

sw3022A-ms98-a-0041 240.918750 248.219000 i mean [vocalized-noise] this guy is dealing drugs it's not set up he was just doing it yeah 
sw3022A-ms98-a-0042 248.219000 261.913625 uh-huh i would love to be on a jury because i i do think it's fascinating i- [vocalized-noise] i i think it it's it's hard system i mean you are never going to get a right and a wrong you know it's just 
sw3022A-ms98-a-0043 261.913625 264.423500 tha[t]- that's right
