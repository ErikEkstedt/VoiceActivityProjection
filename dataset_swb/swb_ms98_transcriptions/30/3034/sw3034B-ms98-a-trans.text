sw3034B-ms98-a-0051 221.429125 225.517375 baseball that's true i i would say that baseball tends to be one of the less
sw3034B-ms98-a-0052 225.517375 229.898875 troublesome sports but uh for some people it's just uh
sw3034B-ms98-a-0053 229.898875 231.293000 uh
sw3034B-ms98-a-0054 231.293000 241.733750 well th[at]- tha[t]- not so much that but uh even in baseball you can like when i played baseball when i was uh growing up i had trouble uh
sw3034B-ms98-a-0055 241.733750 246.761125 uh just throwing the ball because m[y]- i wa[s]- very
sw3034B-ms98-a-0056 246.761125 251.574375 i was always very strong and i could thr[ow]- when i was young i could throw
sw3034B-ms98-a-0057 251.574375 261.406750 harder than my uh like ligaments and all that should have been [laughter-allowed] to and so i was always throwing my arm out and uh
sw3034B-ms98-a-0058 261.406750 271.101750 having trouble i and i was a catcher so i was constantly throwing back to the pitcher and then down to second base and all and and that kind of stuff so i
sw3034B-ms98-a-0059 271.101750 276.238750 that was always a problem for me was just just the constant throwing
sw3034B-ms98-a-0060 276.238750 277.328625 so
sw3034B-ms98-a-0061 277.328625 280.125625 [silence]
sw3034B-ms98-a-0062 280.125625 282.487375 no i did that wrestling

sw3034B-ms98-a-0065 292.630875 301.865625 the other thing was i'd never really let injuries stop me but interestingly enough you mentioned football is like now i won't play football anymore because of the uh
sw3034B-ms98-a-0066 301.865625 305.455500 because_1 i separate a shoulder wrestling so
sw3034B-ms98-a-0067 305.455500 309.962750 um but i stood the stood the injury wrestling but it
sw3034B-ms98-a-0068 309.962750 314.644125 as long as i let it heal it never really bothered me then playing football this fall
sw3034B-ms98-a-0069 314.644125 323.922875 i it was just flag football too i separated it again and it seemed to be like the straw that broke the camels back so
