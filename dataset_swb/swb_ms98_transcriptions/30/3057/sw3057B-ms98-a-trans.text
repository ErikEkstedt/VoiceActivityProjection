sw3057B-ms98-a-0002 1.811500 11.380000 of course we're talking about the elderly and and uh whether or not we we would like nursing homes and as a matter of fact i can tell you something about that 
sw3057B-ms98-a-0003 11.380000 12.481750 [silence]
sw3057B-ms98-a-0004 12.481750 17.972000 no actually my grandmother owned and operated a nursing home for years and her mother
sw3057B-ms98-a-0005 17.972000 28.244125 no she did and then my mother also owned and operated a nursing home for years and then uh went on back to school and became the director of nurses at a nursing home
sw3057B-ms98-a-0006 28.244125 33.163750 and uh my mother and my older sister both are geriatric nurses
sw3057B-ms98-a-0007 33.163750 36.099375 [noise] so i do know something about that
sw3057B-ms98-a-0008 36.099375 37.841000 absolutely
sw3057B-ms98-a-0009 37.841000 49.078375 actually the motivation for grandmother entering the business was that her mother was very old and couldn't seem to find companions
sw3057B-ms98-a-0010 49.078375 63.814875 she was lonely and she needed company for her mother and so she opened a nursing home and initially started with eight ladies and then uh it it grew into a very prosperous business from that point uh then they

sw3057B-ms98-a-0016 75.077875 87.783625 [noise] well that's not really true either uh i think that's a stigma and an i and an impression that has come from some few bad experiences you see those who had bad experiences talk about them_1 
sw3057B-ms98-a-0017 87.783625 94.592125 and those who don't may write a letter to the nursing home and say you did good but they do not talk a whole lot about that

sw3057B-ms98-a-0023 104.644250 106.657625 sure well now
sw3057B-ms98-a-0024 106.657625 108.007500 [silence]
sw3057B-ms98-a-0025 108.007500 119.253750 that's right well that is because they wait until the children make those choices they choose to not make those choices themselves however my daughter-in-law also is a nurse in a nursing home
sw3057B-ms98-a-0026 119.253750 132.276500 and she works for one here in Dallas which is more a retirement village than it is a nursing home and these these i love watching these elderly people come they will come and tell her well i am going over for my tennis lessons 
sw3057B-ms98-a-0027 132.276500 142.973375 and uh would you would you you know call down and have the van come around and take us for our tennis lessons and they're very active and very enthusiastic and they have some excellent programs right there on site
sw3057B-ms98-a-0028 142.973375 147.425500 their dining room looks like you know Luby's Cafeteria
sw3057B-ms98-a-0029 147.425500 154.883375 or or one of the lovely cafeterias and they have you know pink linen napkins for their dinners and a a well equipped library
sw3057B-ms98-a-0030 154.883375 169.184875 oh i am certainly very much for a nursing home and i think when the the parent gets old enough to the extent where they just don't want to be bothered with keeping house and with taking care of themselves anymore that is a wonderful alternative it's expensive 
sw3057B-ms98-a-0031 169.184875 170.994000 [noise] it's costly 
sw3057B-ms98-a-0032 170.994000 172.497375 [silence]
sw3057B-ms98-a-0033 172.497375 173.490500 um-hum
sw3057B-ms98-a-0034 173.490500 187.039125 well now my daddy's mother uh lived in a a retirement village and she and her sister had side by side duplexes one bedroom duplex she still had her individuality
sw3057B-ms98-a-0035 187.039125 197.454875 but they were there close and they did have uh you know the button that you could push the central office if you got into problems and there were lights that you could flip on and so forth and they he did have security
sw3057B-ms98-a-0036 197.454875 200.780000 no i am very much in favor i have heard some horror stories 
sw3057B-ms98-a-0037 200.780000 202.494375 [vocalized-noise]
sw3057B-ms98-a-0038 202.494375 212.130500 i know that the elderly can easily be abused but i would be willing to bet they are far less abused in a nursing home than are they are in [vocalized-noise] homes of their own children

sw3057B-ms98-a-0047 226.230000 235.862375 well now my grandmother of course all of my folks lived to be very old and my grandmother developed Hodgkin's Disease when she was in her late eighties uh late seventies i mean
sw3057B-ms98-a-0048 235.862375 243.220875 she went to the doctor she had surgery she got the treatments and during the period of time that she was undergoing those treatments
sw3057B-ms98-a-0049 243.220875 249.150625 she was in a nursing home she got better she got well she got out and went dancing again
sw3057B-ms98-a-0050 249.150625 250.543375 uh-huh
sw3057B-ms98-a-0051 250.543375 251.560000 [silence]
sw3057B-ms98-a-0052 251.560000 252.634375 that's right
sw3057B-ms98-a-0053 252.634375 262.483625 uh-huh uh-huh i think it is a wonderful interim place it is a place that you don't have to struggle with hospital problems and uh yet it is not you you know you have the 
sw3057B-ms98-a-0054 262.483625 265.546875 um-hum um-hum it certainly is
sw3057B-ms98-a-0055 265.546875 266.721625 [silence]
sw3057B-ms98-a-0056 266.721625 273.674000 it certainly does but you see we have had excellent experience with that and uh i
sw3057B-ms98-a-0057 273.674000 283.750750 i did not put my husband in a nursing home when he became ill but i would not object to going to one i might i might like to be uh coherent enough to make my own choice
sw3057B-ms98-a-0058 283.750750 292.774500 [noise] uh i would not particularly think i would want my kids to say well i think this is what i need for Mom and then dump me there but i would like
sw3057B-ms98-a-0059 292.774500 300.842750 that's right um-hum um-hum and i think you would shop for a nursing home just like you would shop for a church or a doctor or anything else
sw3057B-ms98-a-0060 300.842750 301.897500 [silence]
sw3057B-ms98-a-0061 301.897500 303.475250 um-hum sure

sw3057B-ms98-a-0063 304.935250 312.306750 um-hum when you get to the point where you are in trouble and you have got to have that help you are in no position to make those choices
sw3057B-ms98-a-0064 312.306750 313.825500 that's right

sw3057B-ms98-a-0067 318.850875 326.886750 absolutely i think that one of the best ways to do that is for families to realize they're going to be needing those facilities one day
sw3057B-ms98-a-0068 326.886750 341.287500 and to actually get involved and participate on a community level with community service go out to the nursing home help guide some craft programs perhaps work on some music programs whatever their talents are and work with those senior citizens

sw3057B-ms98-a-0088 383.979875 391.072500 well one of the things i think that is most desirable for the elderly and that is routine
sw3057B-ms98-a-0089 391.072500 396.294750 routine and uh constancy
sw3057B-ms98-a-0090 396.294750 405.806500 uh the only real problem with that in a nursing home is that the staff turns [laughter-over] i don't think they pay the nursing home staff sufficiently to to get the dedication 
sw3057B-ms98-a-0091 405.806500 412.820250 that they might have in some other profession and that's sad because i think the health profession is one of the most critical

sw3057B-ms98-a-0095 423.200000 431.341750 care for the elderly and care for the children i can't imagine a more costly and a more a more uh better area to invest your money
sw3057B-ms98-a-0096 431.341750 434.603375 you're preserving your heritage and your future there

sw3057B-ms98-a-0098 436.065875 440.976625 and as a matter of fact i don't see why they don't have children's programs in nursing homes
