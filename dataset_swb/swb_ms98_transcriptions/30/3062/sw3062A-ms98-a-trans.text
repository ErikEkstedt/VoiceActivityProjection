sw3062A-ms98-a-0042 188.277875 189.721250 right
sw3062A-ms98-a-0043 189.721250 191.907500 oh no

sw3062A-ms98-a-0045 195.810000 197.834875 [vocalized-noise] uh-huh uh-huh 
sw3062A-ms98-a-0046 197.834875 199.737125 [silence]
sw3062A-ms98-a-0047 199.737125 208.067750 right but that's something that parents i think are able to help the gifted child in the home more than they could help the learning disabled child
sw3062A-ms98-a-0048 208.067750 213.853125 so because that's something you can do by just enrichment types of things in the home
sw3062A-ms98-a-0049 213.853125 221.146500 but learning disability unless you are schooled in the types of things and ways to help a child like that
sw3062A-ms98-a-0050 221.146500 234.772125 then it makes it real difficult and this is this to me is the benefit i see in public schools is that that uh you do have government money to fund the kinds of programs
sw3062A-ms98-a-0051 234.772125 244.665375 that these students need and i'm not sure that the private schools or parochial schools address that problem they test kids before they take them
sw3062A-ms98-a-0052 244.665375 249.662000 and if they're a behavior problem they're out that and and uh
sw3062A-ms98-a-0053 249.662000 257.358125 this is a kind of a rejection type of thing and and we get it even at our level in in i work a nine ten school 
sw3062A-ms98-a-0054 257.358125 264.352125 and we get students that come in that have been kicked out of the uh parochial and pub[lic]- and uh private schools
sw3062A-ms98-a-0055 264.352125 270.201750 and uh they come in and their attitude is i'm a bad boy and proceed to [laughter] prove it
sw3062A-ms98-a-0056 270.201750 275.953125 so i i really hate that for them i i would rather they not have that attitude but
sw3062A-ms98-a-0057 275.953125 277.235250 that's
sw3062A-ms98-a-0058 277.235250 282.693125 [silence]
sw3062A-ms98-a-0059 282.693125 284.107125 right

sw3062A-ms98-a-0065 303.291625 304.923000 no
sw3062A-ms98-a-0066 304.923000 307.975875 that's right they can be selective right
sw3062A-ms98-a-0067 307.975875 315.659500 [silence]

sw3062A-ms98-a-0069 316.990250 318.433125 [silence]
sw3062A-ms98-a-0070 318.433125 321.298750 if you choose the select
sw3062A-ms98-a-0071 321.298750 332.368625 top group out of the public schools and tested them and then compared them to the pri[vate]- to the private school group then i think you would have a more equitable
sw3062A-ms98-a-0072 332.368625 345.639750 way and i have a problem when they compare the kids in Japan or Germany to the kids here in in in uh ho[nesty]- honesty the kids in Japan are they have to try out to even get into to which kindergarten they're going to get into
sw3062A-ms98-a-0073 345.639750 353.027625 and then after uh and if if you only the in fact they've had cases in the past where parents have committed suicide
sw3062A-ms98-a-0074 353.027625 365.371625 because their child has not gotten into the top kindergarten which means they probably won't get into the top elementary and and high school and if they don't then af[ter]- when they reach a certain age they just that's the end of their schooling
sw3062A-ms98-a-0075 365.371625 371.570875 and and uh they don't ever really go on it's only their top ones that go on like ours do
sw3062A-ms98-a-0076 371.570875 380.462250 and and uh so that that creates a problem and and you can't compare because they go so many more hours
sw3062A-ms98-a-0077 380.462250 387.039250 the other thing is that the priority in the family is that child's education and is that child

sw3062A-ms98-a-0089 430.744875 439.762000 well and you don't you don't see the parents uh encouraging those students to get on athletic teams or drill teams or band
sw3062A-ms98-a-0090 439.762000 448.196000 it's strictly stick to the educational and it's interesting to see them as they get older uh then that is the type of adult they are
sw3062A-ms98-a-0091 448.196000 449.594250 um
