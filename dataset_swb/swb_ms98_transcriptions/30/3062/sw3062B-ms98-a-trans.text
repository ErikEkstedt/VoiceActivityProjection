sw3062B-ms98-a-0002 1.176250 11.850500 well we've talked a little bit about the Plano school system um i i really have been pleased with Plano i have a child who uh my son is learning disabled
sw3062B-ms98-a-0003 11.850500 18.969125 and uh i thank God every day that i have the resources that we have tapped into
sw3062B-ms98-a-0004 18.969125 24.013125 he's in elementary school and he's not severely learning disabled i mean you know he just
sw3062B-ms98-a-0005 24.013125 35.875500 he's being helped he he was in resource from second grade till fourth grade in math and they recently released him from resource which i'm i was thrilled i really was i i just
sw3062B-ms98-a-0006 35.875500 38.941750 thought that was so neat that they got him over that hump
sw3062B-ms98-a-0007 38.941750 52.574625 and um he's in the Herman Method of Reading i don't know if you're familiar with that it is something new and basically what they do is they start right from the beginning relearning the sounds of letters
sw3062B-ms98-a-0008 52.574625 54.505125 um
sw3062B-ms98-a-0009 54.505125 56.750375 it's wonderful
sw3062B-ms98-a-0010 56.750375 58.316500 [silence]
sw3062B-ms98-a-0011 58.316500 66.354625 yes and it's wonderful he didn't have a problem with reading as a matter of fact he's reading on level the problem was his spelling
sw3062B-ms98-a-0012 66.354625 77.193125 and you know in in watching the way he has struggled it's interesting because i'm convinced i have the same learning disability or had that was ignored and
sw3062B-ms98-a-0013 77.193125 79.536750 [silence]
sw3062B-ms98-a-0014 79.536750 85.846125 that's right and and so it's you know it's not an intelligence problem it's just a problem with learning
sw3062B-ms98-a-0015 85.846125 88.998250 [silence]
sw3062B-ms98-a-0016 88.998250 98.427125 well you know it's funny when um when he was in first grade he had trouble with with spelling and i would say to the teacher
sw3062B-ms98-a-0017 98.427125 103.583125 you know it's amazing he will be able to y[ou]- you'll say to him spell cat 
sw3062B-ms98-a-0018 103.583125 111.114750 and you know he'll say C A T and then he would go to write it and he would write C O T
sw3062B-ms98-a-0019 111.114750 119.847875 and i kept saying to the teacher something is wrong here something is wrong here and the teacher kept saying oh he has a May birthday he's just immature
sw3062B-ms98-a-0020 119.847875 133.107750 [noise] well second grade it was i will these teachers as far as i'm concerned are absolute saints because in second grade it was about the second week of school i went up there and i i requested a conference
sw3062B-ms98-a-0021 133.107750 136.979250 and because all year long they kept telling me i was crazy
sw3062B-ms98-a-0022 136.979250 148.960875 well i was and i and i went up there the second week of school and i said you know something is wrong and thank God the l[eader]- the head teacher uh the team leader was a special education major 
sw3062B-ms98-a-0023 148.960875 151.683625 it was it was and
sw3062B-ms98-a-0024 151.683625 162.668000 she had picked it up yep she had already picked it up and she said you know we we were going to call you if you hadn't called us we think there's a learning disability and we think he needs to be tested immediately
sw3062B-ms98-a-0025 162.668000 170.099750 because you know once the first report card comes in they have all these people being tested and she said i think we can get him real fast
sw3062B-ms98-a-0026 170.099750 176.226750 and sure enough they tested him and you know he qualified for for the help
sw3062B-ms98-a-0027 176.226750 185.968000 and it's been great and i and i thank God i'm here because i i know i have a sister who has the other extreme she has a a child in Connecticut who is extremely gifted
sw3062B-ms98-a-0028 185.968000 190.789875 and because of the cutbacks in the economy they have nothing for her
sw3062B-ms98-a-0029 190.789875 200.935750 and and to me that's the same thing it's it's like having a child who has a learning disability that's being ignored this poor gifted child is being ignored
sw3062B-ms98-a-0030 200.935750 207.100250 [silence]

sw3062B-ms98-a-0053 275.937375 287.096875 well when comparing test scores i know recently i was in a discussion and they were comparing test scores between private schools and public schools and that was one of the points that i made is that you're not comparing apples to apples
sw3062B-ms98-a-0054 287.096875 296.684375 you know you can't say um you know i know Steven probably would not be accepted because he has a learning disability and into a private school
sw3062B-ms98-a-0055 296.684375 300.226625 and um which is which is too bad 
sw3062B-ms98-a-0056 300.226625 307.180875 but on the other hand i i can't necessarily blame them you know they they are a private school and they can do whatever they want
sw3062B-ms98-a-0057 307.180875 313.989500 and they ca[n]- they that's right they have the ability to be selective but you can't say then well public schools are
sw3062B-ms98-a-0058 313.989500 316.358375 are not as good
sw3062B-ms98-a-0059 316.358375 319.605750 perhaps they are because they're they're
sw3062B-ms98-a-0060 319.605750 331.398875 [silence]
sw3062B-ms98-a-0061 331.398875 332.882250 you're right

sw3062B-ms98-a-0072 377.341750 384.714375 [silence]
sw3062B-ms98-a-0073 384.714375 388.868250 right well you see that with the foreigners that come here
sw3062B-ms98-a-0074 388.868250 394.181500 um i i was talking to somebody recently or read somewhere where they where they said that
sw3062B-ms98-a-0075 394.181500 406.303250 you know these children they they had to be the best and they put off all social life all everything you know well is that good yes the child is very bright
sw3062B-ms98-a-0076 406.303250 411.026625 bright but on the other hand i feel like my children who are kind of middle of the road
sw3062B-ms98-a-0077 411.026625 421.803875 have are more rounded you know sure sure i think it's real important to have friends i think it's real important to play sports i think it's real important to be part of a team
sw3062B-ms98-a-0078 421.803875 432.122750 and so that's why i said their childhood is extremely different from mine we didn't do all that you know [laughter] we certainly didn't carpool and run the way i do um
