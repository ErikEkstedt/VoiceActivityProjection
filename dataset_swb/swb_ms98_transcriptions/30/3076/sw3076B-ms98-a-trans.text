sw3076B-ms98-a-0022 73.801375 78.110625 well characteristically in some in the local elections
sw3076B-ms98-a-0023 78.110625 83.075625 typically those people who vote are those who feel very strongly about an issue
sw3076B-ms98-a-0024 83.075625 88.559625 if i do not feel very strongly about an issue then i see no reason to go vote
sw3076B-ms98-a-0025 88.559625 90.690875 [silence]

sw3076B-ms98-a-0031 96.229250 104.755375 well of course of course listening to government the instructors you'll find out that everything matters but then you could go crazy worrying about everything
sw3076B-ms98-a-0032 104.755375 112.160500 [silence]
sw3076B-ms98-a-0033 112.160500 117.709500 well that's the way you get to national and that's the way you make changes about your neighborhood
sw3076B-ms98-a-0034 117.709500 124.669375 uh i know that i have been involved in preparing and in in uh
sw3076B-ms98-a-0035 124.669375 131.376625 carrying out a lot of the local petitions that take place even something so simple as getting a street light
sw3076B-ms98-a-0036 131.376625 141.680875 in between lights on the end of the block but it makes a big difference when it's the difference in having a child run over in the dark and uh
sw3076B-ms98-a-0037 141.680875 152.673125 it took a close call to wake us up and cause us to take that kind of action and that's completely unnecessary In another particular case they were trying to [noise]
sw3076B-ms98-a-0038 152.673125 156.202500 put in a um a senior citizen's home
sw3076B-ms98-a-0039 156.202500 166.902000 in in an area very near our neighborhood but if you just cross that major street the character of the neighborhood changes and it's less savory
sw3076B-ms98-a-0040 166.902000 176.982125 okay and that i was just very i felt very strongly about that those people simply did not have access to safety to security and they were at risk
sw3076B-ms98-a-0041 176.982125 188.645375 and it was for elderly people who lived alone and they were going to put a cluster of of houses there for them but even clustering together for the elderly does not ensure safety
sw3076B-ms98-a-0042 188.645375 201.771875 and all it all it did was to in my judgment make them easier targets uh-huh yeah easier targets and so we we did get a petition together and we very strongly resisted it and
sw3076B-ms98-a-0043 201.771875 209.601000 and it was placed in a actually it was placed clear closer to my neighborhood but it was on the right side of the street
sw3076B-ms98-a-0044 209.601000 214.202250 and uh it it i think that they're they're much more comfortable there
sw3076B-ms98-a-0045 214.202250 223.557750 uh i haven't seen too much crime in my neighborhood although we have a good crime watch program but it's it's very serious just across the street
sw3076B-ms98-a-0046 223.557750 232.615750 [silence]
sw3076B-ms98-a-0047 232.615750 234.576000 well [vocalized-noise]

sw3076B-ms98-a-0050 241.642250 249.263875 no i don't think it had to do to with woman running against man i think it had to do with dirt running against dirtier
sw3076B-ms98-a-0051 249.263875 259.238625 and that's it it was a dirty election people were calling each other uh names and every bit of the trash it was a it was a dirty campaign
sw3076B-ms98-a-0052 259.238625 262.288500 it was a dirty mud slinging campaign

sw3076B-ms98-a-0064 292.137000 296.419250 well course now that's not all the time we've had some pretty
sw3076B-ms98-a-0065 296.419250 308.452500 we were having some pretty healthy uh campaigns that were based on issues there for two or three of the gubernatorial races but i historically Texas has had
sw3076B-ms98-a-0066 308.452500 323.142250 mud and muddier campaigns i mean it's just i think that eventually the you know the better people have the sensibilities and they vote on those people who are least likely to do damage unfortunately that's not always the way it should be
sw3076B-ms98-a-0067 323.142250 329.107625 you don't want to vote for the person who is least likely to do damage you want to do the one who can do the most good
sw3076B-ms98-a-0068 329.107625 330.398625 and uh

sw3076B-ms98-a-0083 364.716375 368.139875 so you see that's very negative motivation isn't it
sw3076B-ms98-a-0084 368.139875 369.787375 isn't that too bad
sw3076B-ms98-a-0085 369.787375 382.320625 we really could use a little positive motivation hey we think this guy can really make some changes and we're going to support him that was true in a lot of cases in in a couple of the older sixties campaigns
sw3076B-ms98-a-0086 382.320625 383.547625 uh
sw3076B-ms98-a-0087 383.547625 394.113500 no i'm talking about national campaigns yeah uh even when John Kennedy was elected there were so many strikes against him but there were people who believed he could make a difference now
sw3076B-ms98-a-0088 394.113500 399.240125 that's not to say what has transpired or what really was i'm saying that's how it was perceived

sw3076B-ms98-a-0093 404.529875 411.732375 absolutely and it and it was people going to vote for i think more than those who voted against
sw3076B-ms98-a-0094 411.732375 415.656500 i know i know that in my own uh
sw3076B-ms98-a-0095 415.656500 425.484625 area of people whom i knew and how they were going to vote they didn't go to vote against uh a politician as they did
sw3076B-ms98-a-0096 425.484625 432.518125 a little bit later when Nixon was running they went to vote against the less of lesser of the two evils in certain cases

sw3076B-ms98-a-0098 433.722250 442.126750 but i think that one was one that you had some very strong feelings among people and they voted their convictions
