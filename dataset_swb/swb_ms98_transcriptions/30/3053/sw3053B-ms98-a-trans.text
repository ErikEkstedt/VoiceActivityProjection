sw3053B-ms98-a-0034 102.033375 111.787875 we have been selected as INC's top five hundred for the last two years yeah so it's really it's exciting to see your name in print and they do um
sw3053B-ms98-a-0035 111.787875 118.879625 the other things that i read are kind of they are all computer related because that's what my company is about but um
sw3053B-ms98-a-0036 118.879625 127.131125 they are not really magazines they are periodicals but i do not know if they would really qualify as magazines i guess so because they have advertising and news print so
sw3053B-ms98-a-0037 127.131125 139.728875 yeah that stuff and Mainframe Journal and Computer World all that boring stuff but it's stuff you got to keep up with or else you you start falling behind
