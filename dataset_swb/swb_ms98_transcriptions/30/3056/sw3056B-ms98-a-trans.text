sw3056B-ms98-a-0013 69.114875 75.378750 uh big warehouse kind of thing which had offices and it was sort of nondescript for a
sw3056B-ms98-a-0014 75.378750 87.736000 you know for the size of the company which inside was basically a store house of a bunch of stuff he collected he he was uh a great collector of of everything he he
sw3056B-ms98-a-0015 87.736000 100.778125 he didn't he didn't throw anything away and uh supposedly this guy had had been breaking there for awhi[le]- he was a like you know burglar had been breaking in there awhile and and had ended up
sw3056B-ms98-a-0016 100.778125 111.143375 h[e]- he had some accomplices that were kind of suspect and they uh they broke in one one night and found a bunch of memos that were uh supposedly from
sw3056B-ms98-a-0017 111.143375 116.153500 from Hughes to uh to his main um
sw3056B-ms98-a-0018 116.153500 124.881375 main a[ssistant]- a[ssistant]- assis[tant]- assistant back uh in the fifties and si[xties]- well i guess in the sixties up until his death

sw3056B-ms98-a-0020 125.909750 127.852125 so it's pretty interesting work so
sw3056B-ms98-a-0021 127.852125 132.333375 [silence]
sw3056B-ms98-a-0022 132.333375 134.260500 yeah it's a it's a little
sw3056B-ms98-a-0023 134.260500 141.739625 it's a little hard it's a it's a you have to plod through it and you know it doesn't doesn't have a real story or any plot you just kind of have to read and understand what is going on
sw3056B-ms98-a-0024 141.739625 143.360000 [silence]
sw3056B-ms98-a-0025 143.360000 147.954125 no i have not seen [laughter-it] but it's but it is it is real interesting
sw3056B-ms98-a-0026 147.954125 157.007000 uh i also reading uh the uh [vocalized-noise] it's a oh an older an another old book that i happen to have i am sort of rereading it it's um
sw3056B-ms98-a-0027 157.007000 168.415375 a book about uh the Bermuda Triangle but it's uh it's about it's a real good book that a guy um wrote who was uh a research librarian he wrote um sort of
sw3056B-ms98-a-0028 168.415375 172.839625 debunking many of the uh uh um
sw3056B-ms98-a-0029 172.839625 178.745625 [noise] the stories about the uh Bermuda Triangle you know he he was saying many many of the uh
sw3056B-ms98-a-0030 178.745625 186.445125 the myths many of the myths of the triangle were uh actually could be explained and and you know
sw3056B-ms98-a-0031 186.445125 192.000875 uh and the rea[son]- reason i was i hadn't picked it back up was in light of the all the uh
sw3056B-ms98-a-0032 192.000875 204.887625 the [vocalized-noise] well when they found the uh the airplanes out in the Atlantic thinking they were Flight Nineteen and i don't know if you are familiar with that at all but it's Flight Nineteen was one of the uh was a [vocalized-noise]
sw3056B-ms98-a-0033 204.887625 214.270125 a collection of a a flight of five Navy adventures at the end of World War Two Right after World War Two and they were they were lost and uh so
sw3056B-ms98-a-0034 214.270125 223.505000 yeah they were and so and in the book you know even [vocalized-noise] he wrote this book back in the seventies and even and even then he
sw3056B-ms98-a-0035 223.505000 231.050500 he ma[de]- had a very good case for the fact that they probably just got lost and they ditched in the water and uh because he he
sw3056B-ms98-a-0036 231.050500 245.391125 he mentions uh he he goes through and and brings out points from the Navy's findings and so forth and uh it's probably you know real close to what you know everyone is thinking now that they just got turned around and couldn't find their way back
sw3056B-ms98-a-0037 245.391125 250.507375 [silence]
