sw3056A-ms98-a-0033 262.052250 273.435875 i thought she was a prisoner of war or something for like ten years well whatever this is one aspect of it of course you know it is so weird cause no one will ever really know it's it the
sw3056A-ms98-a-0034 273.435875 279.489375 so but it's entertaining and it makes you think about things that is for sure
sw3056A-ms98-a-0035 279.489375 281.581000 [silence]
sw3056A-ms98-a-0036 281.581000 282.651625 yeah

sw3056A-ms98-a-0038 291.602625 305.243500 right well i- i just i guess haven't read anyth[ing]- i mean usually i just if i find a good book i will sit you know for two days until it is finished if it's that good and i think the last one i read like that was Scott Thurow's
sw3056A-ms98-a-0039 305.243500 307.200000 and that was Presumed Innocent
sw3056A-ms98-a-0040 307.200000 312.681875 and i just really really liked the way he writes it's just
sw3056A-ms98-a-0041 312.681875 314.873875 incredible
sw3056A-ms98-a-0042 314.873875 315.949125 yeah

sw3056A-ms98-a-0046 336.161500 347.279000 that was good i think and and the other book i am trying to think you know like was in the last year and i think i did read Tom Wolfe and uh Vanity you know Bon yeah
sw3056A-ms98-a-0047 347.279000 349.609250 [noise] and
sw3056A-ms98-a-0048 349.609250 356.617250 yeah i that was really really good the movie was nothing compared to the book and yeah
sw3056A-ms98-a-0049 356.617250 365.693875 oh the movie was a joke [laughter] compared to i mean because Tom Wolfe is so perceptive when it comes to you know pinpointing um
sw3056A-ms98-a-0050 365.693875 372.682125 so[ciety's]- so[ciety's]- soc[iety's]- society's ills and things like that and just nailing people to the wall and exposing things and
sw3056A-ms98-a-0051 372.682125 381.310375 and uh so it was it was a much more intense book than the sort of flimflam that they cast off in the [laughter-movie]
sw3056A-ms98-a-0052 381.310375 393.657000 [laughter] and anyway we are not talking about that but um gee i just i like to read gardening books and things like that just to [laughter-tell] me what to do with my garden and and uh
