sw3071A-ms98-a-0031 113.926125 118.979750 so it was quite popular um you don't play um an instrument so ah

sw3071A-ms98-a-0033 123.786500 134.251250 yeah yeah that i think that's always a good instrument for anybody who sings or does you know some other kind of instrument i think piano is always good background beginner Um
sw3071A-ms98-a-0034 134.251250 146.296375 i played piano all through well i guess from the time i was fi[ve]- five until i graduated from college and uh then i was a piano teacher for a while while my husband was in graduate school so um

sw3071A-ms98-a-0037 157.684875 168.021000 but the i i think that the piano background is very um useful and um i'm sure that it for you it would have been great to be able to accompany yourself just for practicing and so on

sw3071A-ms98-a-0054 231.663875 242.497375 community choruses and uh that's often a good way to get back into it again um it's not r[eally]- terribly demanding you might have to audition but that probably wouldn't be a problem but um 
sw3071A-ms98-a-0055 242.497375 253.114000 [noise] there usually you know that they take tours and things like that and you get to know you know people um socially as well as as in a musical setting so that's always fun i think that's
sw3071A-ms98-a-0056 253.114000 260.317875 well that's one reason why i have enjoyed my choir so much is that not only do we sing wonderful music but we've gotten to know each other quite well um
sw3071A-ms98-a-0057 260.317875 267.007625 in on a a social level and and i think we sing better because of that i think you know i think we sing more like uh
