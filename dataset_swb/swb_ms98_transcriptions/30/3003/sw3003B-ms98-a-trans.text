sw3003B-ms98-a-0003 2.754500 10.528125 well no it's probably going to be a very old used one my husband had an accident in my car a little over a week ago
sw3003B-ms98-a-0004 10.528125 23.161500 and i drove a nineteen seventy seven um BMW and so i believe and i'll know the answer today that they're going to total it i think that it will cost more to fix it than it's probably worth
sw3003B-ms98-a-0005 23.161500 33.608625 but i'm not interested in having any car payments so i actually went last weekend with my father was in town and we went and looked at used cars around town um
sw3003B-ms98-a-0006 33.608625 40.960000 and i you know i found like a nineteen eighty four Regency ninety eight with only forty six thousand miles on it and that was pretty good condition uh
sw3003B-ms98-a-0007 40.960000 44.958125 but i also found a nineteen eighty Volvo uh station wagon
sw3003B-ms98-a-0008 44.958125 52.665000 that was in just super condition i mean there's not a dent on the outside body the inside is clean it's had the same owner for years
sw3003B-ms98-a-0009 52.665000 60.864250 it it has about eighty thousand miles on it but that's all right you know the engine's in excellent shape and i think it'd last me probably another fifty or sixty thousand miles
sw3003B-ms98-a-0010 60.864250 72.323500 so i guess i'm kind of in limbo waiting to see what the insurance is you know company is going to do to see whether or not i can get one of [laughter-these] cars i don't want a new car [laughter-though] a new car payment
sw3003B-ms98-a-0011 72.323500 85.900875 [silence]
sw3003B-ms98-a-0012 85.900875 87.711875 um-hum
sw3003B-ms98-a-0013 87.711875 97.028250 [silence]
sw3003B-ms98-a-0014 97.028250 98.808000 um
sw3003B-ms98-a-0015 98.808000 102.183125 [silence]
sw3003B-ms98-a-0016 102.183125 103.798000 um-hum
sw3003B-ms98-a-0017 103.798000 113.808125 [silence]
sw3003B-ms98-a-0018 113.808125 115.783125 [laughter]
sw3003B-ms98-a-0019 115.783125 124.077625 [silence]
sw3003B-ms98-a-0020 124.077625 137.708375 well not only that needing the room you know we finally ended up buying a Dodge Caravan here about two and a half years ago because_1 i too have very small kids i i have one that's now well she'll be four in September and then a little boy that's just turned two
sw3003B-ms98-a-0021 137.708375 149.928375 and you know it's like you go on a trip and you know you pull over to the side of the road throw them_1 on the hood change a diaper and keep [laughter-going] and i wanted something that i could maybe walk through and get to them and
sw3003B-ms98-a-0022 149.928375 156.810750 [silence]
sw3003B-ms98-a-0023 156.810750 158.664750 well
sw3003B-ms98-a-0024 158.664750 160.456750 yeah
sw3003B-ms98-a-0025 160.456750 166.647000 [silence]
sw3003B-ms98-a-0026 166.647000 168.441000 yeah
sw3003B-ms98-a-0027 168.441000 170.021000 [silence]
sw3003B-ms98-a-0028 170.021000 171.640125 yeah
sw3003B-ms98-a-0029 171.640125 185.964375 [silence]
sw3003B-ms98-a-0030 185.964375 196.679750 we have definitely put a lot of use in on ours and i understand it is too expensive to have two car payments see that was the problem my BMW was paid for and my husband's been in business
sw3003B-ms98-a-0031 196.679750 209.901625 for himself for several years and so he can depreciate cars but you have it used to be you kept them_1 three years well when they did all the tax law changes you had to keep them_1 five so i was trying to keep my BMW in tact in for three more years
sw3003B-ms98-a-0032 209.901625 215.099750 so that then i could take the van and we'd trade my car in on a new car for his business
sw3003B-ms98-a-0033 215.099750 220.258250 and so basically that's what i'm looking for in a used car something that's going to last me at least three years
sw3003B-ms98-a-0034 220.258250 231.720625 well if i can pull a deal on this Volvo you know it will last me longer than that it will actually last me quite a while but i don't know how families afford two new car payments it's just it's outrageous
sw3003B-ms98-a-0035 231.720625 234.812000 [silence]
sw3003B-ms98-a-0036 234.812000 236.184250 um-hum
sw3003B-ms98-a-0037 236.184250 252.590000 [silence]
sw3003B-ms98-a-0038 252.590000 253.897250 um-hum
sw3003B-ms98-a-0039 253.897250 255.640375 that's right
sw3003B-ms98-a-0040 255.640375 261.805125 [silence]
sw3003B-ms98-a-0041 261.805125 265.445750 know how that goes [laughter]
sw3003B-ms98-a-0042 265.445750 269.645625 it's the pits isn't it [laughter]
sw3003B-ms98-a-0043 269.645625 272.563875 [silence]
sw3003B-ms98-a-0044 272.563875 273.997750 that's right
sw3003B-ms98-a-0045 273.997750 275.701125 [silence]
sw3003B-ms98-a-0046 275.701125 285.857000 i know you can't find what you used to could find something for you know seventy five a hundred dollars a month it might not be brand new but it was a decent car and you just almost can't find that payment anymore
sw3003B-ms98-a-0047 285.857000 288.433000 so i understand that it's
sw3003B-ms98-a-0048 288.433000 301.592125 it's kind of hard to go do well if you do look at them_1 i really recommend the Dodge Caravan we've had wonderful it's the only uh minivan they make that's on a car chassis instead of a truck chassis so it doesn't you know shake you around like a tru[ck]- a truck does
sw3003B-ms98-a-0049 301.592125 313.474250 and we have had just wonderful luck with ours i mean it's we take it everywhere it [laughter] it's been i[t's]- i[t's]- it's so easy to get the kids in and out see my car was also a two door
sw3003B-ms98-a-0050 313.474250 322.235125 and which drove me nuts trying to get car seats and kids into a backseat you know and so it's wonderful to have the room and the space and you can haul things and they
sw3003B-ms98-a-0051 322.235125 334.975750 climb in easily and uh it's just been everything that we were hoping it would do for us and it's is nice on long trips in fact Christmas we drove to California which is my home and you can take out the middle seat
sw3003B-ms98-a-0052 334.975750 347.632250 and they come out fairly easily so we took out the middle seat put the car seats in the back and just had a whole area in the middle like if we were out on open road and it was their nap time we just went ahead and laid them_1 down you know i wouldn't do that if we were in a city or
sw3003B-ms98-a-0053 347.632250 352.647125 if there were a lot of cars around or anything but it made it so much easier to travel
sw3003B-ms98-a-0054 352.647125 365.188250 [silence]
sw3003B-ms98-a-0055 365.188250 366.957000 um-hum
sw3003B-ms98-a-0056 366.957000 380.722625 [silence]
sw3003B-ms98-a-0057 380.722625 383.310125 oh yeah
sw3003B-ms98-a-0058 383.310125 392.210375 [silence]
sw3003B-ms98-a-0059 392.210375 395.003875 sure it's a long time
sw3003B-ms98-a-0060 395.003875 397.011625 [silence]
sw3003B-ms98-a-0061 397.011625 398.234375 um-hum
sw3003B-ms98-a-0062 398.234375 402.468500 [silence]
sw3003B-ms98-a-0063 402.468500 404.199000 right
sw3003B-ms98-a-0064 404.199000 413.474500 [silence]
sw3003B-ms98-a-0065 413.474500 415.760125 well that would be good
sw3003B-ms98-a-0066 415.760125 417.751000 that would be good
sw3003B-ms98-a-0067 417.751000 418.813500 [silence]
sw3003B-ms98-a-0068 418.813500 424.188250 well i appreciate talking to you good luck in your car buying [laughter] [vocalized-noise]
sw3003B-ms98-a-0069 424.188250 431.620500 well really i'm supposed to hear today and i i hope it i- i really would prefer the Volvo i think just i know it's older than the Regency but
sw3003B-ms98-a-0070 431.620500 441.962500 you know they're built of that {unibody} steel construction and it would take a hit fairly well and you know my BMW that my husband was going forty to forty five miles an hour and
sw3003B-ms98-a-0071 441.962500 449.767125 you know it didn't even bend the frame it bent in the bumper and the quarter panel but unfortunately they think if it says BMW on it that you have money they don't know
