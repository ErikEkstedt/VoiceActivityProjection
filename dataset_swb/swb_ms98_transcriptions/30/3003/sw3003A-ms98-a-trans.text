sw3003A-ms98-a-0072 364.854000 376.608625 for a little while because she'll sleep some but you know she she wakes up she wants to to get up a[nd]- i know l[ights]- uh t[o]- coming uh right around Christmas we were we were uh Christ[mas]- right before Christmas we had
sw3003A-ms98-a-0073 376.608625 388.487375 driven over to Shreveport and we were driving back and it was when all that bad weather was was hitting and the roads were all closed and uh we were trying to get back and it w[ell]- took us a lot longer and she was
sw3003A-ms98-a-0074 388.487375 401.910750 you know she was pretty good most of the way but then got to a point where she just had to get out of her seat and we had to stop and and we got out and played in the snow and put her back in and she was fine but you know if we had if there was something to where she could kind of get up and and move around like you say on
sw3003A-ms98-a-0075 401.910750 416.554500 on the highway or where it wasn't wasn't as bad you know just for a little brief period of time it would be it would be okay so i'm i'm thinking maybe we can can do something like that later on ye[ah]- we'll see what we can do
