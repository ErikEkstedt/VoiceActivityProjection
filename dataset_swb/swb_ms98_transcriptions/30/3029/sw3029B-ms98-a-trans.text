sw3029B-ms98-a-0003 7.739875 19.032250 [silence]
sw3029B-ms98-a-0004 19.032250 27.883375 well i think that those crimes which are punishable by the death sentence
sw3029B-ms98-a-0005 27.883375 40.208625 need to be reevaluated i think there are other crimes that could easily draw the death penalty and not [laughter-make] [laughter-me] [laughter-feel] bad at all crimes against children is one of them

sw3029B-ms98-a-0011 52.443875 63.896500 actually i would like to see the system revert a lot back to some of the forms of punishment that exist in Middle Eastern countries if you steal you lose a hand
sw3029B-ms98-a-0012 63.896500 69.536875 you know uh [laughter] if you kill you lose your life what's wrong with that

sw3029B-ms98-a-0024 102.608625 108.344375 deciding what that proper punishment is is one thing i think that there should be no way
sw3029B-ms98-a-0025 108.344375 115.245500 i i realize that innocent people could go to uh what is it lethal injection now
sw3029B-ms98-a-0026 115.245500 122.167500 innocent people could do that but for every innocent person who would be executed hopefully there would be ten guilty

sw3029B-ms98-a-0040 152.263875 164.503250 well i don't have solutions to the problems but you know you have these this would be nice if and there's probably thousands of holes in that theory but i think that if you
sw3029B-ms98-a-0041 164.503250 172.823250 did something for example to an individual and caused them to lose the ability to earn a living i remember a man drove by
sw3029B-ms98-a-0042 172.823250 178.026375 randomly shot a women in the head while she was driving blinded her
sw3029B-ms98-a-0043 178.026375 188.188125 i think then that a life sentence to restitution is appropriate i think he should spend the rest of his life working to support that individual
sw3029B-ms98-a-0044 188.188125 191.331875 or the family of an individual
sw3029B-ms98-a-0045 191.331875 195.190750 uh who has been harmed you're you you know
sw3029B-ms98-a-0046 195.190750 205.362875 people who kill policemen policemen who are killed in the line of duty they may or may not have been willfully intending to kill that policeman but that family still has no provider

sw3029B-ms98-a-0071 280.878750 286.075000 that's right technical i think that there should be a statute of limitations on appeals
sw3029B-ms98-a-0072 286.075000 288.585875 you you you can appeal it once
sw3029B-ms98-a-0073 288.585875 301.571000 i think if it is appealed one time and the appeal is turned down or the sentence stands then you might be allowed one more appeal if it is if if it is contradictory
sw3029B-ms98-a-0074 301.571000 304.531375 yeah that's right uh-huh

sw3029B-ms98-a-0080 320.265750 324.729625 that's right well one of the sad things is that so many of these
sw3029B-ms98-a-0081 324.729625 329.291625 never actually come to trial because of
sw3029B-ms98-a-0082 329.291625 333.170375 of the process in which the criminals were apprehended
sw3029B-ms98-a-0083 333.170375 342.750875 i mean uh you know the guy is guilty you know he's done what he's done y[ou]- you may have stood there and seen it but because he wasn't read his rights whenever he was arrested
sw3029B-ms98-a-0084 342.750875 348.172625 you know he he goes free uh-huh uh-huh yeah
sw3029B-ms98-a-0085 348.172625 358.454125 right and i realize that that is designed to protect the innocent it's also designed to line the pockets of lawyers and uh i
sw3029B-ms98-a-0086 358.454125 370.414750 i just don't think [laughter-that] i think we could [laughter-get] [laughter-along] a lot better in our criminal justice system if we [laughter-had] some [laughter-statute] of [laughter-limitations] on [laughter-lawyers] [laughter] i hope you're not a [laughter-lawyer] [laughter]

sw3029B-ms98-a-0090 375.309500 381.784250 absolutely that's why you check books out from the library but i really believe that
sw3029B-ms98-a-0091 381.784250 388.245250 our justice system is is the best around but it's not perfect and that doesn't mean that you leave it in tact

sw3029B-ms98-a-0098 412.660375 423.674000 that's right and and it i don't know there just seems to be so many clever ways to avoid the real intent of the law by following the letter
sw3029B-ms98-a-0099 423.674000 432.492875 and that just that really does ruffle my feathers at times i mean i can just get so aggravated about it
sw3029B-ms98-a-0100 432.492875 433.347500 but
sw3029B-ms98-a-0101 433.347500 440.041625 you know it's it's going to take [laughter-smarter] [laughter-people] than me to solve the problem [laughter-and] and i hope not lawyers [laughter]
