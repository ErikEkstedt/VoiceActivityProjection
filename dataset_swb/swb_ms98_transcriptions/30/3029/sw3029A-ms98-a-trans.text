sw3029A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 4.432250 okay well i'll start off being controversial i'm in favor of it
sw3029A-ms98-a-0002 4.432250 6.266250 [silence]
sw3029A-ms98-a-0003 6.266250 19.150250 [laughter] well it seems to be in the current situations but uh i still feel that it could be a deterrent to crime particularly with the increase of serious crime that's going on now
sw3029A-ms98-a-0004 19.150250 29.595125 [silence]
sw3029A-ms98-a-0005 29.595125 30.775125 okay
sw3029A-ms98-a-0006 30.775125 36.134625 [silence]
sw3029A-ms98-a-0007 36.134625 38.913125 yeah i think that
sw3029A-ms98-a-0008 38.913125 42.768250 oh definitely any any crimes against person
sw3029A-ms98-a-0009 42.768250 53.290125 uh i feel uh there should be more than a slap on the hand and being sent to prison and being released in uh two or three years
sw3029A-ms98-a-0010 53.290125 62.820000 [silence]
sw3029A-ms98-a-0011 62.820000 64.922500 ooh yes that's y[eah]-
sw3029A-ms98-a-0012 64.922500 68.385500 [silence]
sw3029A-ms98-a-0013 68.385500 71.761500 i don't see a thing wrong with that i believe that uh
sw3029A-ms98-a-0014 71.761500 77.943500 well it's just an an example i think there's uh someone that's on trial right now
sw3029A-ms98-a-0015 77.943500 86.033250 here in the Dallas area and they were interviewing the it's a a young lady was killed sometime back a a young girl
sw3029A-ms98-a-0016 86.033250 93.151875 and a personal trial and the reporter was asking a [sup/stupid] stupid question of the people outside well how do you feel about this
sw3029A-ms98-a-0017 93.151875 95.281625 and they you [laughter-know] [laughter-i] [laughter] [laughter-thought] [laughter-that's] 
sw3029A-ms98-a-0018 95.281625 98.165375 how do they feel about it i'm sure that uh
sw3029A-ms98-a-0019 98.165375 102.368125 they want it over with and they want the person punished and punished properly
sw3029A-ms98-a-0020 102.368125 103.436000 but
sw3029A-ms98-a-0021 103.436000 114.234125 [silence]
sw3029A-ms98-a-0022 114.234125 115.473250 yes
sw3029A-ms98-a-0023 115.473250 121.471250 [silence]
sw3029A-ms98-a-0024 121.471250 129.567750 yeah well i feel like the the cost of s[omeone]- someone was quoting figures made the cost at like thirty thousand dollars a year
sw3029A-ms98-a-0025 129.567750 132.010875 to keep someone in prison
sw3029A-ms98-a-0026 132.010875 141.009250 and well the problem there is they're not keeping the right ones in prison in many cases there are more and more instances
sw3029A-ms98-a-0027 141.009250 150.639875 being on the news where this individual was out on the streets on probation or parole and killed someone else
sw3029A-ms98-a-0028 150.639875 153.862750 or seriously injured someone
sw3029A-ms98-a-0029 153.862750 175.860750 [silence]
sw3029A-ms98-a-0030 175.860750 177.109625 yeah
sw3029A-ms98-a-0031 177.109625 183.163625 [silence]
sw3029A-ms98-a-0032 183.163625 184.318750 yes
sw3029A-ms98-a-0033 184.318750 187.140875 [silence]
sw3029A-ms98-a-0034 187.140875 188.782875 yes indeed
sw3029A-ms98-a-0035 188.782875 190.490250 [silence]
sw3029A-ms98-a-0036 190.490250 191.577625 yeah
sw3029A-ms98-a-0037 191.577625 198.247625 [silence]
sw3029A-ms98-a-0038 198.247625 199.537875 yeah
sw3029A-ms98-a-0039 199.537875 204.626875 [silence]
sw3029A-ms98-a-0040 204.626875 211.283125 well here again anytime anyone goes out with a gun in their hand and crime on their mind
sw3029A-ms98-a-0041 211.283125 214.864125 uh the opportunity exists for someone to get killed
sw3029A-ms98-a-0042 214.864125 217.844625 now i'm not in favor of gun control
sw3029A-ms98-a-0043 217.844625 221.798625 to the {n-th} degree or anything because uh
sw3029A-ms98-a-0044 221.798625 225.549375 there are uses for guns which are non criminal
sw3029A-ms98-a-0045 225.549375 235.026250 but it seems that the criminal element are the ones that are using them uh aside from domestic disputes husband shooting wives or vice versa
sw3029A-ms98-a-0046 235.026250 242.939625 but these individuals if they have a gun with them i think that the the sentence should be even longer than if they don't
sw3029A-ms98-a-0047 242.939625 244.788000 [silence]
sw3029A-ms98-a-0048 244.788000 246.022750 well
sw3029A-ms98-a-0049 246.022750 247.727500 [silence]
sw3029A-ms98-a-0050 247.727500 261.690125 well but here again uh if a matter of expediency part of these costs like the people on Death Row is that their appeals can take years and years there should be some uh i know there's a law i believe that
sw3029A-ms98-a-0051 261.690125 265.236125 it's automatic appeal if it's a death sentence
sw3029A-ms98-a-0052 265.236125 269.092500 well i think that automatic appeal ought to take place
sw3029A-ms98-a-0053 269.092500 272.587875 uh within a reasonable length of time say six months
sw3029A-ms98-a-0054 272.587875 275.583125 and a decision be made and not drag out
sw3029A-ms98-a-0055 275.583125 276.926750 in the courts
sw3029A-ms98-a-0056 276.926750 282.972375 for years because of misplaced commas or whatever technicalities there might be
sw3029A-ms98-a-0057 282.972375 285.465125 [silence]
sw3029A-ms98-a-0058 285.465125 288.818750 right th[ere's]- there's got to be a there's got to be a time limit
sw3029A-ms98-a-0059 288.818750 299.671750 [silence]
sw3029A-ms98-a-0060 299.671750 304.496125 a a le[gitimate]- a legitimate appeal not a technicality of uh if
sw3029A-ms98-a-0061 304.496125 306.773750 and they're not arguing that the guy
sw3029A-ms98-a-0062 306.773750 313.803875 or woman committed the crime they're arguing over well were his civil rights violated because uh
sw3029A-ms98-a-0063 313.803875 320.979750 someone didn't file the proper paper at the proper time those are the things that have caused them to drag out i think
sw3029A-ms98-a-0064 320.979750 332.585125 [silence]
sw3029A-ms98-a-0065 332.585125 333.796375 yeah
sw3029A-ms98-a-0066 333.796375 341.147875 [silence]
sw3029A-ms98-a-0067 341.147875 341.696000 yeah
sw3029A-ms98-a-0068 341.696000 342.809875 [silence]
sw3029A-ms98-a-0069 342.809875 346.916125 he didn't see his lawyer as quickly as he should have or or some some
sw3029A-ms98-a-0070 346.916125 348.850000 Mickey Mouse [laughter-type] [laughter-thing] like that
sw3029A-ms98-a-0071 348.850000 353.799125 [silence]
sw3029A-ms98-a-0072 353.799125 356.479500 oh [laughter-yes] [laughter]
sw3029A-ms98-a-0073 356.479500 365.677250 [silence]
sw3029A-ms98-a-0074 365.677250 367.272500 [laughter] [laughter-yes] [laughter] 
sw3029A-ms98-a-0075 367.272500 377.844000 no i'm not a lawyer i i[t's]- i i i'm an accountant and i agree we practice law ourselves because it's too expensive to hire lawyers [laughter] to a degree
sw3029A-ms98-a-0076 377.844000 379.916625 there you go
sw3029A-ms98-a-0077 379.916625 387.698000 [silence]
sw3029A-ms98-a-0078 387.698000 395.319000 well it's it's a case that we have a a legal system which the criminals have found a way to
sw3029A-ms98-a-0079 395.319000 399.768875 use and a way to benefit them rather than the public itself
sw3029A-ms98-a-0080 399.768875 401.310875 so
sw3029A-ms98-a-0081 401.310875 405.985500 that's how we get caught in this uh sort of a catch twenty two
sw3029A-ms98-a-0082 405.985500 408.774750 but you have to continue uh
sw3029A-ms98-a-0083 408.774750 412.936125 to protect the innocent you're giving an open door to the guilty
sw3029A-ms98-a-0084 412.936125 422.842500 [silence]
sw3029A-ms98-a-0085 422.842500 423.994375 yeah
sw3029A-ms98-a-0086 423.994375 427.749875 [silence]
sw3029A-ms98-a-0087 427.749875 431.333375 [laughter-yes] [laughter] it does most people
sw3029A-ms98-a-0088 431.333375 437.523875 [silence]
sw3029A-ms98-a-0089 437.523875 439.261250 but again one of our
sw3029A-ms98-a-0090 439.261250 449.543500 one of our problems is that uh our legislature and the state and our national congress the majority of the members there of are lawyers
