sw3073A-ms98-a-0017 39.593500 47.922000 that type of show but we like L A Law we like that we're just i'm sorry they're breaking the team up because we liked all the ones that were on there
sw3073A-ms98-a-0018 47.922000 50.800750 i'm not sure i like the new ones too much
sw3073A-ms98-a-0019 50.800750 57.915750 [silence]
sw3073A-ms98-a-0020 57.915750 61.439625 i just wonder if if uh they just want to go on to
sw3073A-ms98-a-0021 61.439625 63.990000 other projects and not be
sw3073A-ms98-a-0022 63.990000 71.043250 stuck in this show since it's gone on for so long it looks like it looks like it might be one of these seven or eight year run things
sw3073A-ms98-a-0023 71.043250 78.297375 where you kind of can spend your whole career on one show of course i guess that's not bad Alan Alda did it on MASH and 
sw3073A-ms98-a-0024 78.297375 85.915125 it hasn't hurt him at all so do you do you mostly like this type of like a story type of thing that lasts an hour
sw3073A-ms98-a-0025 85.915125 92.169875 [silence]
sw3073A-ms98-a-0026 92.169875 97.665000 in one hour like Quantum Leap [laughter] that's one of our favorites [laughter]
sw3073A-ms98-a-0027 97.665000 99.532500 [silence]
sw3073A-ms98-a-0028 99.532500 103.998000 right which they do at the beginning of the season to grab your attention
sw3073A-ms98-a-0029 103.998000 111.200375 yeah that's always a bummer too sometimes it's better just to tape record both of them and then watch it all in one
sw3073A-ms98-a-0030 111.200375 121.779875 we we do that sometimes i i guess i'm i'm not into real heavy stuff L A Law is about the heaviest thing i watch i i'll mostly i'm into it for relaxation
sw3073A-ms98-a-0031 121.779875 135.388750 so i like things like Golden Girls or Cheers or uh Monday night is real good with me you know Major Dad and and uh uh Northern Exposure and and uh oh what's that one with Burt Reynolds
sw3073A-ms98-a-0032 135.388750 143.901000 that type of show is what we what uh we watch we generally just stay on one channel all for all of Monday night just to watch those
sw3073A-ms98-a-0033 143.901000 154.995625 just uh some of the times they're continued but mostly they're just little vignettes a new one we found we really like is that Dinosaurs have you seen that that is it's it's really funny they use
sw3073A-ms98-a-0034 154.995625 168.787625 like animated it's not like a cartoon but it's like dummies and things that are used and uh it's really um and robots probably but uh there's always a a moral to each story
sw3073A-ms98-a-0035 168.787625 178.122500 well you we watched it the times we've seen it it's been like on Satur[day]- or excuse me Friday night uh but it's we've only seen it a couple of times but it
sw3073A-ms98-a-0036 178.122500 186.198750 it's real the first one we saw um uh they were uh it it involved a tradition
sw3073A-ms98-a-0037 186.198750 193.116500 of when a per[son]- person reaches seventy five uh and i can't remember what day they call it but but uh
sw3073A-ms98-a-0038 193.116500 201.346500 the son-in-laws get to throw the mother-in-laws when they're seventy five over a cliff [laughter] anyway [laughter]
sw3073A-ms98-a-0039 201.346500 213.446375 anyway it it goes on you know and the son-in-law and mother-in-law are sniping at each other and all and then when it comes time for him to throw her over well the the teenaged son the night before tried to save her by hiding her
sw3073A-ms98-a-0040 213.446375 220.662125 and she said no you can't do you know he ran her out was running to hi[de]- in a wheelchair to hide her and she said you can't do that uh this is 
sw3073A-ms98-a-0041 220.662125 230.920500 tradition this is what old people are supposed to be [laughter-thrown] [laughter-over] the the cliff and uh he said i don't understand it's it's real funny that they give the teenagers
sw3073A-ms98-a-0042 230.920500 242.855375 the as the one that questions um the what's going on and uh in the end of uh the son-in-law when he did get the mother-in-law up to the cliff uh
sw3073A-ms98-a-0043 242.855375 256.554625 th[e]- the so[n]- the teenaged son throws himself in the way and says no you can't do it and then and then uh oh well we've got to do it it's tradition and the son was you know why and so in in the end he doesn't throw her over and of course the town thinks he's just terrible
sw3073A-ms98-a-0044 256.554625 260.485750 because that has been tradition for hundreds of years and
sw3073A-ms98-a-0045 260.485750 264.416875 he's broken it and then we saw one where this there was a teenage
sw3073A-ms98-a-0046 264.416875 271.900000 when a b[oy]- teenage boy comes into his manhood they call it the night of the howling [laughter-or] [laughter-something] [laughter-like] [laughter-that] and they all go out and [laughter-howl] [laughter-you] [laughter-know]
sw3073A-ms98-a-0047 271.900000 284.386875 and and the son refused to do it he he did he thought it was not no he wouldn't go howl so all the all the people that worked with the father ostracized [laughter-him]
sw3073A-ms98-a-0048 284.386875 293.201625 it is it it it's it's real interesting to watch the show and and wh[at]- the relationship between the family is is really now the mo[ther-in-law]-
sw3073A-ms98-a-0049 293.201625 302.970375 now the mother-in-law lives in the house with them so it's our our grandson our oldest grandson is the one that that got us to watching it but it really is
sw3073A-ms98-a-0050 302.970375 313.323000 it moves real fast it's a real short and there's always like i say a moral to it and righ[t]- half hour that that's all there is to it and and uh they
sw3073A-ms98-a-0051 313.323000 322.227000 yeah it's it they they're trying to liken the the father in there of the teenage son to like Jackie Gleason Show uh
sw3073A-ms98-a-0052 322.227000 330.271500 the way he talks to his mother-in-law and so forth and i guess maybe there are some parts of that but i didn't really see that in there but what i've read about it they
sw3073A-ms98-a-0053 330.271500 342.028125 talk about that but anyway we've we've enjoyed that and and uh i guess mostly i i like the news shows too and the news magazines like Sixty s[econds]- Minutes or Twenty Twenty or
sw3073A-ms98-a-0054 342.028125 349.651875 Prime Time Live or something like that you know all all of those shows if i if i can do it but my husband likes to watch uh

sw3073A-ms98-a-0069 438.144250 447.631750 and i and i'd tell him you know it's getting ready to fall out and he walked around the house with his fa[ce]- face down toward the floor and his mouth open hoping it would fall out because he wouldn't let anybody pull it
