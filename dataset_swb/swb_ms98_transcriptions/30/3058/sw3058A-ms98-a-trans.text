sw3058A-ms98-a-0026 99.705500 113.966250 kind of a hush hush thing that she'd written this book so we all had to read it for a sociology class so um no i don't the author was like Madge Larson or something like that it was a kind of feminist
sw3058A-ms98-a-0027 113.966250 124.131000 Star Trek people on a [noise] it's the the woman had been a POW in Vietnam who wrote it and so she she's one of the first female POW's and so she had um
sw3058A-ms98-a-0028 124.131000 135.198750 kind of paralleled that with kind of a space version of it and it was kind of it was interesting i don't know if it was interesting just because i knew the person who'd written it or if it was actually a good book
sw3058A-ms98-a-0029 135.198750 139.003625 but i've never really read a lot of science fiction it's

sw3058A-ms98-a-0042 188.984375 203.491625 au[thors]- authors like Bobbie Ann Mason she's from Kentucky and writes a lot of just kind of contemporary realism sort of stuff um John Barthelme who wrote he just died a few years ago and he wrote kind of weird avant-garde
sw3058A-ms98-a-0043 203.491625 213.497375 short fiction and then like in the sixties through the late eighties and he was kind of responsible for turning around the short story movement so that was [noise] kind of neat um
