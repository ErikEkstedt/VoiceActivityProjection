sw3072A-ms98-a-0003 3.763125 6.592250 [silence]
sw3072A-ms98-a-0004 6.592250 9.785000 Detroit is that a nice vacation spot
sw3072A-ms98-a-0005 9.785000 12.845750 [silence]
sw3072A-ms98-a-0006 12.845750 14.599000 right okay
sw3072A-ms98-a-0007 14.599000 18.392875 [silence]
sw3072A-ms98-a-0008 18.392875 24.066375 right so you probably wouldn't recommend that as t[ourist]- big tourist spot 
sw3072A-ms98-a-0009 24.066375 30.187250 [silence]
sw3072A-ms98-a-0010 30.187250 32.582750 ooh that would be nice
sw3072A-ms98-a-0011 32.582750 35.064875 did you scuba dive there
sw3072A-ms98-a-0012 35.064875 40.584125 [silence]
sw3072A-ms98-a-0013 40.584125 42.314000 ooh that would be nice
sw3072A-ms98-a-0014 42.314000 45.632500 [silence]
sw3072A-ms98-a-0015 45.632500 47.769750 oh that would be enjoyable
sw3072A-ms98-a-0016 47.769750 58.460000 [laughter-right] yeah that's a nice break i haven't been on vacation in a while either um usually when we go we go to Colorado to Estes Park area which is up kind of near Denver
sw3072A-ms98-a-0017 58.460000 66.813750 and uh stay in the mountains up there do a little hiking and resting get away from the Texas heat that kind of thing
sw3072A-ms98-a-0018 66.813750 73.056125 so it's a lot of fun i worked up there last summer so i guess it was kind of like a vacation the whole summer long [laughter]
sw3072A-ms98-a-0019 73.056125 76.061625 worked at a camp there and so i got to
sw3072A-ms98-a-0020 76.061625 78.930875 spend a lot of time up in the mountains
sw3072A-ms98-a-0021 78.930875 82.413875 so that's probably my favorite place when i have to go somewhere
sw3072A-ms98-a-0022 82.413875 84.264625 on a vacation
sw3072A-ms98-a-0023 84.264625 88.540250 [silence]
sw3072A-ms98-a-0024 88.540250 89.819625 oh
sw3072A-ms98-a-0025 89.819625 98.299125 [silence]
sw3072A-ms98-a-0026 98.299125 102.944125 that's nice we um we canoed up in Arkansas at the Buffalo River
sw3072A-ms98-a-0027 102.944125 106.816875 and that's the best place that i've ever canoed it was really
sw3072A-ms98-a-0028 106.816875 118.000750 really pretty i was a little kid then and we to have uh we stayed at some park and they had a little uh mountain man who came down the river every night and he would give a little talk about
sw3072A-ms98-a-0029 118.000750 118.251875 [laughter]
sw3072A-ms98-a-0030 118.251875 123.925250 mountain things you know i think he wasn't a real mountain man but we were pretty convinced he was a full hermit who [laughter-lived] [laughter-up] in
sw3072A-ms98-a-0031 123.925250 134.727125 the woods that he'd come in his little log boat down the river and we would have to we'd [vocalized-noise] and he'd make sassafras tea out of sassafras roots that he'd found and
sw3072A-ms98-a-0032 134.727125 139.723750 that's that's a good family place to go and then the river was really nice because it wasn't too 
sw3072A-ms98-a-0033 139.723750 142.082500 frightening but it wasn't
sw3072A-ms98-a-0034 142.082500 143.462500 you know
sw3072A-ms98-a-0035 143.462500 145.321625 too easy either
sw3072A-ms98-a-0036 145.321625 146.575125 so it was like
sw3072A-ms98-a-0037 146.575125 152.736250 [silence]
sw3072A-ms98-a-0038 152.736250 154.348875 that's true
sw3072A-ms98-a-0039 154.348875 160.114375 [silence]
sw3072A-ms98-a-0040 160.114375 161.433875 um-hum
sw3072A-ms98-a-0041 161.433875 162.938500 [silence]
sw3072A-ms98-a-0042 162.938500 164.253875 right
sw3072A-ms98-a-0043 164.253875 167.392000 [silence]
sw3072A-ms98-a-0044 167.392000 168.732125 yeah
sw3072A-ms98-a-0045 168.732125 169.760500 [silence]
sw3072A-ms98-a-0046 169.760500 176.964875 well that's good well we um let's see the only other place i've ever vacationed we'd you know go on camping trips up to Texoma and things like that
sw3072A-ms98-a-0047 176.964875 179.833000 and then i went to England
sw3072A-ms98-a-0048 179.833000 187.032750 a few years ago i was a student there and spent um a semester studying abroad in London
sw3072A-ms98-a-0049 187.032750 193.594625 and that was a great time because it's so that's such a neat place and it's there's not a language barrier so you don't i mean there [laughter]
sw3072A-ms98-a-0050 193.594625 196.989250 there's a little bit because_1 there's some of those English words that you just don't
sw3072A-ms98-a-0051 196.989250 202.910250 exactly know what they mean and a lot of people have trouble wrestling with their accents but it's
sw3072A-ms98-a-0052 202.910250 208.916625 it was really fun i- i- i really enjoyed that i'm probably going back there to work for a year
sw3072A-ms98-a-0053 208.916625 227.094625 [silence]
sw3072A-ms98-a-0054 227.094625 235.168875 it it's really nice i would i would spend all my time in London or most of my time and that's it was really different being in a big city because i don't
sw3072A-ms98-a-0055 235.168875 239.568625 get much into [laughter] urban you know really urban areas a lot
sw3072A-ms98-a-0056 239.568625 251.704375 and it was it's really it's sort of a weird little anonymous feeling where no one knows who you are and you can spend a whole day without talking to anyone which i thought i would just hate but it ended up being kind of nice [laughter-because_1] [laughter-you're] not accountable to anyone
sw3072A-ms98-a-0057 251.704375 253.599000 you could just kind of
sw3072A-ms98-a-0058 253.599000 261.788625 kind of walk around and observe i did a lot of just going out by myself and riding on the subway and w[atching]- watching people
sw3072A-ms98-a-0059 261.788625 264.349875 and i had a great time doing that
sw3072A-ms98-a-0060 264.349875 266.423875 it was really interesting
sw3072A-ms98-a-0061 266.423875 268.835125 [silence]
sw3072A-ms98-a-0062 268.835125 276.312875 yeah i know i [laughter] keep wanting to get up to i haven't i haven't been anywhere else outside the United States i haven't been to Mexico or Canada
sw3072A-ms98-a-0063 276.312875 277.624375 or
sw3072A-ms98-a-0064 277.624375 279.333375 [silence]
sw3072A-ms98-a-0065 279.333375 280.855000 oh
sw3072A-ms98-a-0066 280.855000 283.827375 [silence]
sw3072A-ms98-a-0067 283.827375 289.779000 yeah that would be nice i had a friend from there then i i'd love to go somewhere in Asia but i'd have to have a
sw3072A-ms98-a-0068 289.779000 289.993750 [laughter]
sw3072A-ms98-a-0069 289.993750 292.012750 tour guide with me to
sw3072A-ms98-a-0070 292.012750 294.628125 help with all the language and all that
sw3072A-ms98-a-0071 294.628125 295.885625 [silence]
sw3072A-ms98-a-0072 295.885625 307.482125 so yeah that's why that's why England was nice even we traveled in Europe for about a week and that was even nice because there wasn't uh th[e]- most the places we went we went to Germany and Switzerland and
sw3072A-ms98-a-0073 307.482125 308.493250 [silence]
sw3072A-ms98-a-0074 308.493250 311.178625 well i yeah we [noise] have [laughter-we] just kind of 
sw3072A-ms98-a-0075 311.178625 314.840875 we did we {whirlwinded} through Europe it was [laughter]
sw3072A-ms98-a-0076 314.840875 320.656250 just insane twelve days where we'd just stop like a city a day and you slept on the train at night
sw3072A-ms98-a-0077 320.656250 328.873000 but there wasn't a it was strange it was kind of sad there wasn't ever a language problem there because everyone in Germany knew English and everyone in Switzerland knew English
sw3072A-ms98-a-0078 328.873000 337.412625 so [laughter] we were kind of pitiful we found one restaurant we were in and got seated and then no one knew English in there and we were just [laughter]
sw3072A-ms98-a-0079 337.412625 343.170625 finally had to break out the phrase book and start looking up things but it was uh
sw3072A-ms98-a-0080 343.170625 345.842000 oh i had fondue that was easy to say 
sw3072A-ms98-a-0081 345.842000 347.353125 [laughter] 
sw3072A-ms98-a-0082 347.353125 350.785125 tried to get fondue and white wine and that was
sw3072A-ms98-a-0083 350.785125 357.261625 we were able to have that pretty pretty effortlessly there were some people at the next table who spoke English so we
sw3072A-ms98-a-0084 357.261625 361.134500 elicited their aid for a while and [laughter-they] were
sw3072A-ms98-a-0085 361.134500 363.227625 very helpful so
sw3072A-ms98-a-0086 363.227625 364.459250 it was
sw3072A-ms98-a-0087 364.459250 368.438500 it was a pleasant time i'd i'd love to go back there
sw3072A-ms98-a-0088 368.438500 371.515000 there's just not time [laughter]
sw3072A-ms98-a-0089 371.515000 376.161125 there's not enough time to go see everything and then to afford to see everything
sw3072A-ms98-a-0090 376.161125 382.567125 [silence]
sw3072A-ms98-a-0091 382.567125 383.917375 right
sw3072A-ms98-a-0092 383.917375 384.999500 that's
sw3072A-ms98-a-0093 384.999500 386.470875 [silence]
sw3072A-ms98-a-0094 386.470875 387.740375 [laughter]
sw3072A-ms98-a-0095 387.740375 389.221750 that and sleeping late
sw3072A-ms98-a-0096 389.221750 389.937000 [laughter]
sw3072A-ms98-a-0097 389.937000 391.067875 [silence]
