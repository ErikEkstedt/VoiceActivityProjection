sw3009B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.932625 [noise]
sw3009B-ms98-a-0002 0.932625 4.942250 well i take it since you selected this topic that you have children
sw3009B-ms98-a-0003 4.942250 5.975750 [silence]
sw3009B-ms98-a-0004 5.975750 7.328375 you don't
sw3009B-ms98-a-0005 7.328375 9.100875 [silence]
sw3009B-ms98-a-0006 9.100875 11.814750 my goodness [laughter]
sw3009B-ms98-a-0007 11.814750 16.021250 so well i have two daughters and um
sw3009B-ms98-a-0008 16.021250 26.344750 they're past this they've been latchkey children for a while and they're almost where i can start saying they're you know young adults so i don't have to worry about child care too much anymore
sw3009B-ms98-a-0009 26.344750 27.829625 um
sw3009B-ms98-a-0010 27.829625 28.998500 [silence]
sw3009B-ms98-a-0011 28.998500 33.279250 we're supposed to discuss what criteria we would ask or expect
sw3009B-ms98-a-0012 33.279250 37.680500 [silence]
sw3009B-ms98-a-0013 37.680500 39.706250 well if i were look[ing]-
sw3009B-ms98-a-0014 39.706250 41.208375 [silence]
sw3009B-ms98-a-0015 41.208375 53.135750 exactly exactly um i think my my top priority would be that it would be someone who would be responsible and someone that would actually like children
sw3009B-ms98-a-0016 53.135750 59.159500 [silence]
sw3009B-ms98-a-0017 59.159500 60.460250 um-hum
sw3009B-ms98-a-0018 60.460250 62.715875 [noise] and i think that varies
sw3009B-ms98-a-0019 62.715875 67.294125 i think a lot of your criteria vary with the age of your child
sw3009B-ms98-a-0020 67.294125 68.882500 [silence]
sw3009B-ms98-a-0021 68.882500 79.309625 um you know it's it's it's once they get to a certain age it's almost more important that it's someone that can entertain your child as opposed to someone who's
sw3009B-ms98-a-0022 79.309625 83.865250 you know really really qualified per se
sw3009B-ms98-a-0023 83.865250 85.394375 um
sw3009B-ms98-a-0024 85.394375 87.097500 [silence]
sw3009B-ms98-a-0025 87.097500 95.353375 with with a baby definitely have to be someone who knows how to handle a baby and would know how to respond to an emergency 
sw3009B-ms98-a-0026 95.353375 96.592625 [silence]
sw3009B-ms98-a-0027 96.592625 97.754125 so
sw3009B-ms98-a-0028 97.754125 120.256625 [silence]
sw3009B-ms98-a-0029 120.256625 123.043500 oh uh-huh uh-huh
sw3009B-ms98-a-0030 123.043500 134.680875 [silence]
sw3009B-ms98-a-0031 134.680875 142.049500 well i my experience i babysat a lot also at when i grew up and um 
sw3009B-ms98-a-0032 142.049500 153.064625 coming from you know that background and the background as a parent now i think the reason that people don't ask a whole lot of questions is
sw3009B-ms98-a-0033 153.064625 162.647625 a a lot of times babysitters i know i did this with my children it's you get somebody where you kind of know the family already
sw3009B-ms98-a-0034 162.647625 169.661125 and that gives you so much basic knowledge that you don't ask a whole lot of questions
sw3009B-ms98-a-0035 169.661125 176.763500 because_1 because i had three younger brothers and sisters myself so they they thought okay she knows how to how to treat children [laughter]
sw3009B-ms98-a-0036 176.763500 197.617250 [silence]
sw3009B-ms98-a-0037 197.617250 199.801250 uh-huh uh-huh
sw3009B-ms98-a-0038 199.801250 208.029250 [silence]
sw3009B-ms98-a-0039 208.029250 209.220000 wow
sw3009B-ms98-a-0040 209.220000 232.022125 [silence]
sw3009B-ms98-a-0041 232.022125 237.137500 oh i agree with you but there again she she you know she knew
sw3009B-ms98-a-0042 237.137500 244.546125 knew of your family and she and she met in a safe setting such as church
sw3009B-ms98-a-0043 244.546125 253.525250 so she was going on those two instincts just the same i know myself i never and i was very very protective on who babysat my children 
sw3009B-ms98-a-0044 253.525250 254.545875 [silence]
sw3009B-ms98-a-0045 254.545875 267.410875 and and in it it really shocked me because just about six months ago someone came to my front door rang the doorbell she had just moved in the neighborhood she had her daughter with her and the daughter was oh about a second grader
sw3009B-ms98-a-0046 267.410875 272.015125 and she was actively looking for people who would babysit her child
sw3009B-ms98-a-0047 272.015125 277.876500 and i thought well she doesn't know me or my children from anything and
sw3009B-ms98-a-0048 277.876500 288.008625 it was i was almost more reluctant of letting my older children go babysit for her because_1 i didn't know her [laughter] then she was reluctant of letting strangers into her house
sw3009B-ms98-a-0049 288.008625 292.113875 so i mean people are so different
sw3009B-ms98-a-0050 292.113875 298.697625 [silence]
sw3009B-ms98-a-0051 298.697625 301.794125 [noise] well i did i did have um
sw3009B-ms98-a-0052 301.794125 312.465500 my my child uh in a day care for just a short time a[nd]- when my oldest was about two and a half and i worked just a part-time job and
sw3009B-ms98-a-0053 312.465500 318.456000 uh in in those situations um what i did is i'd
sw3009B-ms98-a-0054 318.456000 331.001875 i went in and you know i made a few phone calls i went in and visited i asked questions such as how they would discipline a child um that was a concern with me um you know [vocalized-noise]
sw3009B-ms98-a-0055 331.001875 341.320625 you you learn a lot by going in there and they e[xplain]- they explain to you you know what their day consists of and what their general rules are and um
sw3009B-ms98-a-0056 341.320625 343.592750 [vocalized-noise] that's you know
sw3009B-ms98-a-0057 343.592750 344.668625 [silence]
sw3009B-ms98-a-0058 344.668625 352.232000 that's as much as i know you probably could get really good feedback from a lot of other working mothers
sw3009B-ms98-a-0059 352.232000 356.840625 you know that have done this over and over again but i
sw3009B-ms98-a-0060 356.840625 357.947250 go ahead
sw3009B-ms98-a-0061 357.947250 362.779000 [silence]
sw3009B-ms98-a-0062 362.779000 371.435625 um i think lots of people lot i think i went by location for one thing i think most people do that i think you start out with the criteria of
sw3009B-ms98-a-0063 371.435625 377.848375 you know do i know of anything or do i know anyone who has their child in a day care and
sw3009B-ms98-a-0064 377.848375 379.907625 [silence]
sw3009B-ms98-a-0065 379.907625 381.141625 right
sw3009B-ms98-a-0066 381.141625 392.224250 right and then you know i mean even at that you have to consider the logistics of it you know i mean you're not going to take your child south of town if you work north
sw3009B-ms98-a-0067 392.224250 395.853000 you even if that's the best one in the whole wide world [laughter]
sw3009B-ms98-a-0068 395.853000 400.229625 so there there are just so many considerations
sw3009B-ms98-a-0069 400.229625 404.186625 [silence]
sw3009B-ms98-a-0070 404.186625 412.582500 oh money is always a factor in my life definitely [laughter] i've never you know i've never had the luxury of not having that be a factor um
sw3009B-ms98-a-0071 412.582500 422.512125 even in something as important as day care i know if i didn't have that stipulation i would have done things differently
sw3009B-ms98-a-0072 422.512125 433.206000 you know um Montessori school would be something that i would have pursued but that's always a little bit more expensive than what i could look at
sw3009B-ms98-a-0073 433.206000 434.875750 um
sw3009B-ms98-a-0074 434.875750 440.048000 [noise] and i was very very fortunate in that i didn't have to do that on a full-time basis
sw3009B-ms98-a-0075 440.048000 441.104500 [silence]
sw3009B-ms98-a-0076 441.104500 448.407000 so and and then when you get you know when you get into the full-time basis day care
