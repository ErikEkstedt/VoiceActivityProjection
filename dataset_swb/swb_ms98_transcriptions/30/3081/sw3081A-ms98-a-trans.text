sw3081A-ms98-a-0055 300.478125 308.047250 as a dip i thought gosh you know sometimes when we have it at home it it turns dark on the top so quickly so i just
sw3081A-ms98-a-0056 308.047250 309.541875 [silence]

sw3081A-ms98-a-0065 351.462750 357.061000 mo[st]- sometimes it seems to be cheaper too so we often buy the we buy the
sw3081A-ms98-a-0066 357.061000 371.061250 yeah yeah so we bought that or we bought the the fillets and then the chicken or turkey nuggets and i don't think anybody in my house knows the difference unless you tell them [laughter-so] or in
