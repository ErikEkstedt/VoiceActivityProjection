sw3016A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.883375 [noise]
sw3016A-ms98-a-0002 0.883375 2.843250 do you have any
sw3016A-ms98-a-0003 2.843250 6.177750 [silence]
sw3016A-ms98-a-0004 6.177750 20.507375 i have i have one it's it's and it's a real pet peeve of mine it seems i i do work during the day and when i'm home uh you know i'm either cooking or running doing things or uh laundry or stuff and i hate when the phone rings
sw3016A-ms98-a-0005 20.507375 23.538500 and it turns out to be a telephone salesman
sw3016A-ms98-a-0006 23.538500 24.787500 [silence]
sw3016A-ms98-a-0007 24.787500 31.197375 and it's real t[wo]- there're two pet peeves about it number one i really feel that that's my private you know my own home
sw3016A-ms98-a-0008 31.197375 41.215375 and i ha[te]- and if i want something i will get it i will go out and get it myself and i will never i never buy anything from a telephone salespers[on]-
sw3016A-ms98-a-0009 41.215375 53.196125 so i really feel that it is a real invasion they're invading my time and my space by uh you know interfering in whatever i'm doing for and i it really bothers me
sw3016A-ms98-a-0010 53.196125 63.279125 um it's a little bit like junk mail but except you can't you know ignore it uh quite as easily and i i try to be polite but at the same point
sw3016A-ms98-a-0011 63.279125 68.637250 well i just say thank you very much for calling but i'm not interested and then i hang up before they can say anything
sw3016A-ms98-a-0012 68.637250 78.632000 yes and it works very well [laughter] because you don't hear you don't ha[ve]- they can say anything they want it's just but i just feel that's my big thing on the invasion of my thing on invasion of privacy
sw3016A-ms98-a-0013 78.632000 80.577500 and um
sw3016A-ms98-a-0014 80.577500 83.165375 i have i sort of have a thought like you can
sw3016A-ms98-a-0015 83.165375 86.665750 prevent yourself from getting junk mail by getting yourself off of mailing lists
sw3016A-ms98-a-0016 86.665750 94.078000 i wish that there were a way that you could um get your tel[ephone]- you know submit your telephone number to the phone company and have a penalty
sw3016A-ms98-a-0017 94.078000 98.892250 for anyone who calls you to sell things from a business
sw3016A-ms98-a-0018 98.892250 100.365250 [silence]
sw3016A-ms98-a-0019 100.365250 109.406125 uh you y[ou]- y[ou]- you do that by uh um the postal service has some information which you fill out and they se[nd]- it's for every company i mean you can't do it for any compan[y]-
sw3016A-ms98-a-0020 109.406125 118.802750 you know but you can then send it and they can pro[ve]- they tell that company's not allowed to sent it you any junk mail if you get junk mail on a regular basis from any particular company you can
sw3016A-ms98-a-0021 118.802750 123.069375 yeah yeah you have to go to the post office and ask them for the form that you fill out to
sw3016A-ms98-a-0022 123.069375 126.647875 not to get you know junk mail from specific companies
sw3016A-ms98-a-0023 126.647875 140.633750 and i wish there were something like that where you can call the telephone company and you could say that uh have your na[me]- your number put in a registry and then anyone making these calls has to check that registry for that area
sw3016A-ms98-a-0024 140.633750 147.396875 and could not should and is not allowed under penalty of you know being reported or something to call you
sw3016A-ms98-a-0025 147.396875 150.471625 so that would be one way of doing it [laughter]
sw3016A-ms98-a-0026 150.471625 161.346125 [silence]
sw3016A-ms98-a-0027 161.346125 163.115000 um-hum
sw3016A-ms98-a-0028 163.115000 165.786375 [laughter]
sw3016A-ms98-a-0029 165.786375 167.794750 [silence]
sw3016A-ms98-a-0030 167.794750 176.060000 oh i'm guilty of that sometimes because i've called and there really wasn't any significant message and i and i wasn't going to be available to be called back
sw3016A-ms98-a-0031 176.060000 187.969000 and it was sort of like oh the hell i'm not going to spend the time giving and leaving a message and uh i'll call later [laughter] if i'm available the other thing that um that there is recourse to and that's another thing is
sw3016A-ms98-a-0032 187.969000 192.620000 when you you use your credit card and then they ask for a telephone number
sw3016A-ms98-a-0033 192.620000 197.687625 well le[gally]- legally now they're not allowed they're n[ot]- you do not have to give a telephone number
sw3016A-ms98-a-0034 197.687625 201.104000 yes and i don't really like announcing in public
sw3016A-ms98-a-0035 201.104000 215.015875 you know when you're sitting there my telepho[ne]- and i don't like the the the way telephone numbers can be used we once had a situation where someone was using a credit card number of ours and he actually had our phone number but it turned out it had to been my husband's office phone number
sw3016A-ms98-a-0036 215.015875 223.326875 and uh we were able we weren't actually able to trace it but we were able to to discard the charges um but it was
sw3016A-ms98-a-0037 223.326875 228.460750 [silence]
sw3016A-ms98-a-0038 228.460750 230.013125 um-hum
sw3016A-ms98-a-0039 230.013125 231.879500 um-hum
sw3016A-ms98-a-0040 231.879500 235.746375 yeah same with my husband it was a charge card and social security number
sw3016A-ms98-a-0041 235.746375 242.685250 [silence]
sw3016A-ms98-a-0042 242.685250 245.596625 well you should never give the social security number
sw3016A-ms98-a-0043 245.596625 249.168500 uh if sometimes if you charge sometimes i charge theater tickets
sw3016A-ms98-a-0044 249.168500 253.710875 over the phone and then you know because they pick them up at the box office will call
sw3016A-ms98-a-0045 253.710875 259.530250 but um that's the only thing i would ever have ever used it for the phone and that was because i initiated it
sw3016A-ms98-a-0046 259.530250 262.975375 uh and occasionally i do order things from catalogs
sw3016A-ms98-a-0047 262.975375 267.692500 over the phone but again it's i initiate it not the company
sw3016A-ms98-a-0048 267.692500 272.672375 the other thing is though you do not have to if you're buying something in a store and they a[sk]- and you pay for it by charge
sw3016A-ms98-a-0049 272.672375 280.955125 and they ask you for your telephone number you do not have to give it that is one that's a law that went into effect i don't know a year or two ago
sw3016A-ms98-a-0050 280.955125 289.525500 and uh you can just say i'm sorry that yo[u]- uh i'm not required to give that by law and then they won't uh a lot of stores will still ask
sw3016A-ms98-a-0051 289.525500 298.201125 but uh the credit card company you know accepts the charges i mean it's a re[sponsibility]- the credit cards company uh -[company]'s responsibility
sw3016A-ms98-a-0052 298.201125 300.052750 so what and this
sw3016A-ms98-a-0053 300.052750 304.902125 [silence]
sw3016A-ms98-a-0054 304.902125 310.407125 um well this it would this is limited to the privacy issue the invasion of privacy
sw3016A-ms98-a-0055 310.407125 320.594000 yeah and i guess uh that was my that's probably my biggest one in terms of invasion of privacy for people outside the family of course i've got little pet peeves you know with my family
sw3016A-ms98-a-0056 320.594000 330.235500 [laughter-you] [laughter-you] know but of course th[at]- th[at]- i guess that just comes with the uh with the territory with a family that does a mother you lose some [laughter-privacy]
sw3016A-ms98-a-0057 330.235500 332.275750 but uh
sw3016A-ms98-a-0058 332.275750 334.772875 [silence]
sw3016A-ms98-a-0059 334.772875 339.536500 um-hum nothing that you felt that you know any experiences you've had at work
sw3016A-ms98-a-0060 339.536500 347.383375 [silence]
sw3016A-ms98-a-0061 347.383375 356.212875 so many things i think over the years have been um accepted i mean when you uh that are no longer done
sw3016A-ms98-a-0062 356.212875 363.757875 i mean i can remember when i was very young much younger and i applied for a job they said well do[n't]- aren't you planning to have children well i mean that's none of their business
sw3016A-ms98-a-0063 363.757875 367.314875 and but of course now by law they can't ask that
sw3016A-ms98-a-0064 367.314875 372.419375 so i mean there has been i think a lot to done to protect privacy
sw3016A-ms98-a-0065 372.419375 374.093125 how do you feel
sw3016A-ms98-a-0066 374.093125 377.434375 [silence]

sw3016A-ms98-a-0071 386.611375 391.560250 that's right do you feel that drug testing is an invasion of privacy
sw3016A-ms98-a-0072 391.560250 393.881500 or AIDS testing
sw3016A-ms98-a-0073 393.881500 397.408125 [silence]

sw3016A-ms98-a-0078 408.129750 417.391750 i feel that way too i sometimes feel tha[t]- you know sometimes individual rights including the right to privacy have to be sacrificed for a greater benefit
sw3016A-ms98-a-0079 417.391750 422.863250 you know for example [vocalized-noise] airline pilots [laughter-i] [laughter-mean] i do want my pilot to be sober [laughter]
