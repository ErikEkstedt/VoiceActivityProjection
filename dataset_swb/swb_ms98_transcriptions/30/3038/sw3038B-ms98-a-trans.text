sw3038B-ms98-a-0003 2.676375 10.056875 okay China Cry was basically the the true story written by this this lady who had uh
sw3038B-ms98-a-0004 10.056875 14.413750 was a native is native Chinese uh
sw3038B-ms98-a-0005 14.413750 24.052625 uh who was raised by Christian parents and her her time frame was prior to the nineteen forty nine revolution
sw3038B-ms98-a-0006 24.052625 27.199000 although she herself had never really
sw3038B-ms98-a-0007 27.199000 34.391000 accepted Jesus or gone through any of the other uh Christian uh
sw3038B-ms98-a-0008 34.391000 43.173250 portions of of the faith repentance baptisms et cetera et cetera she had always felt a very strong uh
sw3038B-ms98-a-0009 43.173250 49.764250 leaning in this direction and whenever the cultural revolution of nineteen forty nine occurred
sw3038B-ms98-a-0010 49.764250 59.593375 and most churches were either banned or their all the clergy and so forth were ah killed or or imprisoned or and the property confiscated
sw3038B-ms98-a-0011 59.593375 65.899750 she was safe because she had you know not officially joined the the Christian movement
sw3038B-ms98-a-0012 65.899750 69.020250 [noise] so
sw3038B-ms98-a-0013 69.020250 79.392375 [noise] anyway she as she grew up towards maturity her parents well her dad was a doctor and and he was rather well you know rather well to do in the old regime
sw3038B-ms98-a-0014 79.392375 84.119750 and the the Chin[a]- the commu[nist]- the communist Chinese didn't like this at all
sw3038B-ms98-a-0015 84.119750 88.691500 you know the bourgeoisie was was was definitely out of uh style then
sw3038B-ms98-a-0016 88.691500 92.143375 everybody was back to a commonality of one
sw3038B-ms98-a-0017 92.143375 96.555000 and so they kept picking at him picking at his at her mother
sw3038B-ms98-a-0018 96.555000 99.069125 and uh finally
sw3038B-ms98-a-0019 99.069125 101.508250 uh started picking on her
sw3038B-ms98-a-0020 101.508250 105.457000 and getting her to you know they were starting to uh
sw3038B-ms98-a-0021 105.457000 107.769375 accuse her of of of uh
sw3038B-ms98-a-0022 107.769375 115.560625 crimes and atrocities before the the revolution and and had her write her own story over and over and over
sw3038B-ms98-a-0023 115.560625 121.688875 uh and the uh the major point of the movie was that that she had
sw3038B-ms98-a-0024 121.688875 125.005000 uh married this this Chinese fellow
sw3038B-ms98-a-0025 125.005000 132.776125 and was with child when they started this mass court now i think i'm leaving out a portion she gr[aduated]- she went through college and graduated
sw3038B-ms98-a-0026 132.776125 143.675875 very high up in her class and had uh gotten a job as as an instructor and they had her teaching or were starting to have her teach history for the soldiers
sw3038B-ms98-a-0027 143.675875 157.531000 when the they decided that that she needed to start recanting of all of her pre uh regime crimes as it were being a child you know so
sw3038B-ms98-a-0028 157.531000 166.638375 they kept on and on at at her and in the meantime she and her husband uh were ex[pecting]- ex[pecting]- were expecting a child their own child
sw3038B-ms98-a-0029 166.638375 175.072500 and uh the the people kept harassing her over you know over a period of months and finally
sw3038B-ms98-a-0030 175.072500 177.298375 they uh carried her
sw3038B-ms98-a-0031 177.298375 183.966250 uh out into the courtyard to to either really to shoot her or to go through the motions of of
sw3038B-ms98-a-0032 183.966250 195.522000 shooting her uh with by firing or you know executing her by firing squad and uh the Lord just said no this is not going to happen even though this lady has not really
sw3038B-ms98-a-0033 195.522000 200.950750 you know she's she's one of mine she is not going to die and um
sw3038B-ms98-a-0034 200.950750 205.351250 the the the soldiers were blinded when they shot 
sw3038B-ms98-a-0035 205.351250 207.818375 and she her life was spared
sw3038B-ms98-a-0036 207.818375 210.705750 and this this frightened the the uh
sw3038B-ms98-a-0037 210.705750 216.116625 the commandant and so he called this kind of stuff off and just put her in the labor camp
sw3038B-ms98-a-0038 216.116625 218.164875 well uh
sw3038B-ms98-a-0039 218.164875 223.467125 and course here's this this woman who is heavy with child dragging rocks around
sw3038B-ms98-a-0040 223.467125 225.552000 well she she put in for
sw3038B-ms98-a-0041 225.552000 233.636500 going in [vocalized-noise] going to uh and her husband had escaped to Hong Kong uh and then she put in to go see him
sw3038B-ms98-a-0042 233.636500 245.134500 and over time she uh uh finally through her perseverance and writing enough letters to enough different people embarrassed enough of the the middle
sw3038B-ms98-a-0043 245.134500 249.088500 uh bureauc[racy]- bureaucracy that they finally let her go
sw3038B-ms98-a-0044 249.088500 261.600000 and of course she had to walk you know they they stripped her of everything practically besides the the clothes on her back and uh so she so she went across the border to her husband and another and other child that they'd already had
sw3038B-ms98-a-0045 261.600000 263.033000 uh to freedom
sw3038B-ms98-a-0046 263.033000 276.867375 and they knew that she wasn't going to come back but yeah she did years later when the uh liberalization you know in real life uh liberalization of China happened and uh she was not persecuted or anything else like that
