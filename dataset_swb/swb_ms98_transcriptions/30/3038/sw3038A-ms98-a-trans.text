sw3038A-ms98-a-0042 311.768125 323.142625 well uh i guess what i what i saw most recently and luckily i saw it only a week ago [laughter] so i'd remember remember it well was um sort of light by comparison uh
sw3038A-ms98-a-0043 323.142625 326.778125 my husband and i had this great desire to go see a comedy and
sw3038A-ms98-a-0044 326.778125 330.093500 and uh we ended up going to see Green Card
sw3038A-ms98-a-0045 330.093500 332.909250 Green Card and and uh 
sw3038A-ms98-a-0046 332.909250 338.047625 he chose it and uh it's got this wonderful French actor who's
sw3038A-ms98-a-0047 338.047625 342.937875 it was his like his and he's been a star in France and a wonderful actor who we've enjoyed for years
sw3038A-ms98-a-0048 342.937875 348.818125 but he's never made an American film this was his American film debut and he speaks very broken English
sw3038A-ms98-a-0049 348.818125 355.272000 and basically he played um a Frenchman who married an American girl
sw3038A-ms98-a-0050 355.272000 357.839750 uh in a marriage of convenience
sw3038A-ms98-a-0051 357.839750 362.504375 so that he could get his green card which is what an alien needs to work in this country
sw3038A-ms98-a-0052 362.504375 369.683625 and uh because she could claim she was married she could get uh an apartment or a condominium in a very exclusive
sw3038A-ms98-a-0053 369.683625 374.274125 building in New York that had a garden an an an outside garden which is very unusual there
sw3038A-ms98-a-0054 374.274125 386.270125 because she was a horticulturist and that was sort of her dream of course you know they got married and they never saw each other again except except fate threw them together and the Immigration and national Naturalization Service
sw3038A-ms98-a-0055 386.270125 391.679000 um started investigating so they had to get back together and get their stories straight [laughter]
sw3038A-ms98-a-0056 391.679000 397.103875 and and she was a very s[ophisticated]- well sophisticated
sw3038A-ms98-a-0057 397.103875 401.821125 urban New Yorker and he was a poor Frenchman who had grown up on the
sw3038A-ms98-a-0058 401.821125 409.041125 on the streets and sort of pulled himself up by his bootstraps and claimed to be a composer but there was no proof whatsoever that he really was
sw3038A-ms98-a-0059 409.041125 411.673125 he'd been working in a restaurant when they met
sw3038A-ms98-a-0060 411.673125 413.524000 and uh
sw3038A-ms98-a-0061 413.524000 420.797125 they had to learn all about each other basically in a in a weekend and uh it was you knew what was going to happen of course
sw3038A-ms98-a-0062 420.797125 425.538375 that they would fall in love well they fell into like at any rate and
sw3038A-ms98-a-0063 425.538375 427.942750 and when they went to the
sw3038A-ms98-a-0064 427.942750 430.795375 query or inquisition or whatever
sw3038A-ms98-a-0065 430.795375 436.619875 uh they did perfectly and then he said something because his English was so poor on for the most part he
sw3038A-ms98-a-0066 436.619875 440.005375 he was so proud of himself for giving ex[amples]- all the correct answers that
sw3038A-ms98-a-0067 440.005375 448.053000 that on the last one he said oh i never remember that answer and that clued the investigator that he had memorized a series of answers
sw3038A-ms98-a-0068 448.053000 449.649125 so um
