sw3024B-ms98-a-0022 83.907375 91.143875 we we had a townhouse here uh we still have a townhouse which we are renting out so this is our first uh i guess single family home
sw3024B-ms98-a-0023 91.143875 101.609500 and so we find that we have uh a lot to do uh to fix it up to the way we like it a lot of remodeling and all uh mostly cosmetic and we had a a deck put in in the back
sw3024B-ms98-a-0024 101.609500 107.662625 so it looks you know that's real nice to go out in now and then a fence around the yard so that the kids can stay in the yard [laughter]
sw3024B-ms98-a-0025 107.662625 109.699875 and not run around the neighborhood

sw3024B-ms98-a-0038 148.709500 154.824125 uh okay well what we have our family room when ah you know we bought it we noticed that it was really dark
sw3024B-ms98-a-0039 154.824125 160.244500 and uh one of the things that it has in it is uh real dark paneling wooden paneling 
sw3024B-ms98-a-0040 160.244500 161.681875 and uh
sw3024B-ms98-a-0041 161.681875 174.353875 it also has brown carpet and just kind of uh two small windows so what we are thinking of doing is uh uh changing the carpet to a lighter color and then we have heard that with the paneling you can wallpaper over it
sw3024B-ms98-a-0042 174.353875 185.517500 or paint it and so that's what we are planning to do is to put a chair rail across the family room paint or wallpaper from the chair rail up and then uh
sw3024B-ms98-a-0043 185.517500 190.439875 paint the chair rail on down in in like a a light blue color sort of i guess
sw3024B-ms98-a-0044 190.439875 203.180000 uh Williamsburg blue we are calling it but whether the[re's]- there's a color like that or not since we are near Williamsburg but uh we are hoping that will lighten up the room a lot and make it give it you know give it a bigger appearance it has a fireplace in it too
sw3024B-ms98-a-0045 203.180000 208.381375 and if that doesn't work we uh our next door neighbor is a roofer and he said he would help me put in a skylight so
sw3024B-ms98-a-0046 208.381375 212.728250 we'll try that last resort if uh if the painting does not help
sw3024B-ms98-a-0047 212.728250 216.267625 [silence]

sw3024B-ms98-a-0059 251.404125 255.792250 is it uh is it a real short or a thick carpet real short
sw3024B-ms98-a-0060 255.792250 269.259750 okay because we were looking at something that people are we have seen advertised called i guess it's {berber} or something or {berbar} or something and uh and we understand that that's supposed to be good for like a family room cause it's you know it wears really well and all that

sw3024B-ms98-a-0075 308.289500 315.558625 so uh as far as uh keeping the vents open and closed you know this is all new to us not having a house that had this before and
sw3024B-ms98-a-0076 315.558625 323.529875 and uh keeping the vents open you know during when it's warm and summer and all that and i guess spring summer fall and i guess in the winter you close the vents and
sw3024B-ms98-a-0077 323.529875 327.745750 and making sure that the rain the rain gutters from you know the roof and all
sw3024B-ms98-a-0078 327.745750 330.654125 empty out i- [noise] instead of right near the house

sw3024B-ms98-a-0097 382.398625 394.731125 much mowing yeah well actually it's a lot bigger than we thought it was [laughter] when we first saw it when we actually have to mow it it seems to get bigger but uh the mow the way ours is is it's kind of a pie shaped
sw3024B-ms98-a-0098 394.731125 405.477250 uh you know boundaries or whatever and we are sitting against the pointy end of the pie the house sits back and it so our front yard is actually the bigger yard and um
sw3024B-ms98-a-0099 405.477250 416.604250 and when we first got here you know there's it it i guess a long time ago it uh you know we were talking to our neighbors and they said the yard was one of the bett[er]- or the best yard in the neighborhood because [vocalized-noise] really kept it up and over the years uh
sw3024B-ms98-a-0100 416.604250 421.282750 just people were just renting it out and all that they a lot of weeds and all that have grown up
sw3024B-ms98-a-0101 421.282750 432.353250 and so we have decided to get somebody for one year of service to help control the weeds and get it green again and then i will take over from there and so but i have to mow it at least once a week or else it looks bad
sw3024B-ms98-a-0102 432.353250 433.405875 so
