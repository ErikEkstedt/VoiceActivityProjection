sw3007B-ms98-a-0002 1.488750 13.624000 yes i've had i've had a number of them_1 in my lifetime and i've i am a golden retriever fan but i had to replace it with something that the kids could carry yes yes
sw3007B-ms98-a-0003 13.624000 24.973500 yes well they were they really wanted something teeny tiny and i uh really wanted that retriever's disposition uh the ultimate to tolerant trainable disposition so i called
sw3007B-ms98-a-0004 24.973500 32.068250 four or five dog trainers because_1 i don't like the little dogs and and i asked them you know these are the ages of the kids what do i get
sw3007B-ms98-a-0005 32.068250 42.334000 and they all said golden retriever and i said okay put it under twenty pounds and the only thing that they could come up with was a bichon frise which is a do you know what that is
sw3007B-ms98-a-0006 42.334000 49.283000 they're cute they look like an airheaded dog but let me tell you they're calm they're not {yappy} they're trainable
sw3007B-ms98-a-0007 49.283000 58.774125 they're uh very personable in a different way that a golden retriever is they're not dignified like a retriever can be yeah so how old is your retriever
sw3007B-ms98-a-0008 58.774125 68.486375 [noise]
sw3007B-ms98-a-0009 68.486375 79.373000 well actually you know that's the breed standard for females what you yeah what you see shown and bred now as golden retrievers this you know plus eighty to a hundred pound range
sw3007B-ms98-a-0010 79.373000 86.999750 that is not breed standard fifty five is the minimum but they usually run about sixty to sixty five and the ones that are shown
sw3007B-ms98-a-0011 86.999750 96.316750 they are inside that weight allowance you cannot show your retriever if it's you know a hundred plus pounds so don't say she's small just say she's perfect
sw3007B-ms98-a-0012 96.316750 97.989875 [noise]
sw3007B-ms98-a-0013 97.989875 100.174875 uh-huh
sw3007B-ms98-a-0014 100.174875 101.883500 yep
sw3007B-ms98-a-0015 101.883500 112.490750 [noise]
sw3007B-ms98-a-0016 112.490750 123.553500 well they are they are the ultimate dogs to have around kids so long as your kids not scared of a big dog because i had a retriever actually i had a retriever Irish setter cross
sw3007B-ms98-a-0017 123.553500 129.409250 which is a really nice animal and fortunately it was just like a retriever and then i've had a retriever
sw3007B-ms98-a-0018 129.409250 138.525125 it was gorgeous it was just gorgeous i mean just gorgeous um and they both you know both the half breed and the pure breed had the um
sw3007B-ms98-a-0019 138.525125 144.439750 what i consider the the the perfect disposition but you know what you know what scares me about golden retrievers
sw3007B-ms98-a-0020 144.439750 154.491625 since they've become so popular you get what i call backyard breeders which is probably where yours came from people that don't know what they're doing and
sw3007B-ms98-a-0021 154.491625 167.086625 they breed them_1 you know for a certain characteristic and in the retrievers it happens to be they like them big for somehow big is perceived as better and when you start doing that you really tamper with you know the all the the years of uh
sw3007B-ms98-a-0022 167.086625 171.424750 culling litters and and uh you tamper with what the dog innately is
sw3007B-ms98-a-0023 171.424750 184.029125 [vocalized-noise] when i was when i bought my last purebred retriever i mean i looked all over because_1 i wanted one that still looked like retriever you know the short to the ground stocky golden 
sw3007B-ms98-a-0024 184.029125 197.800250 uh trainable tractable quiet animal that could hunt and still be in the house and i ended up getting one that uh came out of a a a hunting stock because i wanted one that could still perform like a retriever did
sw3007B-ms98-a-0025 197.800250 202.368875 and i've seen an awful lot of lately really dumb
sw3007B-ms98-a-0026 202.368875 213.802875 dumb retrievers and i'm and i really fear for the breed because i love that breed but i really figure right when it becomes really popular that it's going to be ruined [noise]
sw3007B-ms98-a-0027 213.802875 219.970250 [noise]
sw3007B-ms98-a-0028 219.970250 234.350500 oh yeah you bet you you bet you you know how they came up with the retriever don't you the golden it was bred out of several different retrievers and they bred it for companionship and uh uh disposition and and ability to hunt it was kept only by kings
sw3007B-ms98-a-0029 234.350500 246.814250 but they selectively culled those litters i mean for many hundreds of years and since it slept in the castle with its master i mean it had it had to be of a disposition to make it you know an animal you could keep around that closely 
sw3007B-ms98-a-0030 246.814250 253.664750 but they would go through all the litters and destroy the puppies if they were anything other than perfect now you know that seems like a cruel thing to do
sw3007B-ms98-a-0031 253.664750 261.861750 on the other hand you sure you know they sure created a a wonderful breed i mean a wonderful breed
sw3007B-ms98-a-0032 261.861750 273.236625 [noise]
sw3007B-ms98-a-0033 273.236625 274.717000 uh-huh
sw3007B-ms98-a-0034 274.717000 281.191875 [silence]
sw3007B-ms98-a-0035 281.191875 289.381500 well i tell you you know the the German shepherd is the classic case of what i'm talking about because in America that's called a Rin Tin Tin phenomena
sw3007B-ms98-a-0036 289.381500 299.963250 only in America is there a dog called a German shepherd that dog is bred out of three European dogs the Belgian Tervurien a German schutzhund and
sw3007B-ms98-a-0037 299.963250 309.920000 [noise] i always forget the third one i can see it uh [noise] but the third one is a children's dog and
sw3007B-ms98-a-0038 309.920000 320.997250 there are distinct breeds in Europe now what happened over here was is that people saw the the first um which would actually have been a schutzhund which is what Rin Tin Tin was
sw3007B-ms98-a-0039 320.997250 326.523500 and everybody wanted Rin Tin Tin and it was known as a German shepherd here
sw3007B-ms98-a-0040 326.523500 338.722000 so they created a breed standard the American Kennel Club did that said anything that is a schutzhund a a Tervurien and uh Alsatian that's the other one Alsatian
sw3007B-ms98-a-0041 338.722000 350.499125 any inner breeding of that can be called a German shepherd here and what happened is is that people wanted this shepherd to shepherd and protect and they bred a dog that
sw3007B-ms98-a-0042 350.499125 358.265625 i the it's called a an animal's critical span which basically translates to how much shit will it take before it bites you
sw3007B-ms98-a-0043 358.265625 371.573500 that German shepherd the American German shepherd here was a a a such an unreliable animal that the American Seeing Eye Institute refused to use them because_1 they would turn on th[eir]- on their handlers and
sw3007B-ms98-a-0044 371.573500 384.889750 even um uh police corps which started you know finding other breeds to use because this thing this this thing known as a German shepherd here its personality and its dependability and its reliability was just terrible
sw3007B-ms98-a-0045 384.889750 395.053875 so about fifteen years ago the German Shepherd Club of America decided amongst themselves that they were going to change this so they went back to Europe
sw3007B-ms98-a-0046 395.053875 400.811875 and brought back some good examples of each of the three breeds and bred
sw3007B-ms98-a-0047 400.811875 412.357125 to a standard what they wanted an American German shepherd to be which is a very heavily now schutzhund and Alsatian and it's the Alsatian that's the kid's dog it's just you see them_1 in Europe and they're just lovely
sw3007B-ms98-a-0048 412.357125 422.998750 but you'll see i mean if you ever start looking in papers now and you start seeing these ads for German shepherds they will say on them bred for disposition AKC conforming
sw3007B-ms98-a-0049 422.998750 436.662500 which means that their advertising that this is no longer an indiscriminate dog this is bred for and they had to go through and destroy a for a while there about seventy five percent of their puppies that they bred
sw3007B-ms98-a-0050 436.662500 450.712750 because they were looking for this disposition and nowadays you you'll get you'll get a dog trainer to recommend a specific you know breeder handler they'll recommend their shepherds as a children's dog but
