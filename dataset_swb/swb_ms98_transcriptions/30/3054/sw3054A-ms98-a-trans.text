sw3054A-ms98-a-0007 13.304750 27.841375 oh yes uh-huh um the we have not camped in any of those places in fact it has been a number of years since we have camped um but we used to go to Tyler State Park and um to Dangerfield and 
sw3054A-ms98-a-0008 27.841375 31.540500 in Texas that is where we camped basically um
sw3054A-ms98-a-0009 31.540500 41.583250 they're very nice Tyler is really really a neat place to camp it has a n[ice]- a nice little lake and it has some really wonderful uh sights that are in the the wooded areas
sw3054A-ms98-a-0010 41.583250 47.471625 um the facilities are quite nice and our children like liked it quite well uh the kids are
sw3054A-ms98-a-0011 47.471625 59.680625 well they were quite a bit younger then and uh you know i[t]- they we felt real um safe uh with their being able to to do what they would like to do there in the area and uh it was just it was a really nice place to to camp 
sw3054A-ms98-a-0012 59.680625 67.861750 um now Dangerfield is let's see i think that's a little bit mo[re]- more east further east
sw3054A-ms98-a-0013 67.861750 77.184250 and maybe south if i am remembering where that is no i think it's a little bit further north when i think about it at any rate it was it was very nice as well but Tyler we sort of got spoiled with i think
sw3054A-ms98-a-0014 77.184250 90.910250 but uh we had lived in Michigan before we came here and um had done a lot of camping in Michigan i think the upper peninsula of Michigan especially and then also we had done some camping in Colorado in the mountains so uh
sw3054A-ms98-a-0015 90.910250 99.543375 my parents were real avid campers [vocalized-noise] and my husband's parents were really avid campers as well so i guess we just kind of came by it naturally [laughter]
sw3054A-ms98-a-0016 99.543375 102.487375 do you um have a large tent or
sw3054A-ms98-a-0017 102.487375 104.193750 [silence]

sw3054A-ms98-a-0023 118.001375 132.801000 well sort of early on especially as our children got a little bit bigger uh we invested in some stacking um cots you know that were like bunk bunk beds but they were cots fold up cots that really gave us a lot more space um floor space and
sw3054A-ms98-a-0024 132.801000 142.636500 so you didn't have to be constantly getting things off the floor in order to walk walk around and uh gave us some s[pace]- you know some place to stack things during the day so that was real nice 
sw3054A-ms98-a-0025 142.636500 145.448250 but uh we um
sw3054A-ms98-a-0026 145.448250 158.269375 my my uh uh in-laws also had a camper um pop up t[ent]- tent you know one of those trailer pop ups and those are really nice too and the little more uh luxurious so to speak but not much [laughter]
sw3054A-ms98-a-0027 158.269375 166.337625 yes uh-huh it's really nice in fact it even have a had a little refrigerator and and the whole business it was quite nice in that respect and
sw3054A-ms98-a-0028 166.337625 174.211375 uh everything was very convenient and you didn't have to to be hauling things out of your the trunk of you car so that was nice yeah
