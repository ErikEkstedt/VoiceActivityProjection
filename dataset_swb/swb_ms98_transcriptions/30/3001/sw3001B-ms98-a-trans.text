sw3001B-ms98-a-0008 16.731250 18.760000 [silence]
sw3001B-ms98-a-0009 18.760000 22.277000 so you don't have any benefits at all to talk about
sw3001B-ms98-a-0010 22.277000 24.086875 [laughter]
sw3001B-ms98-a-0011 24.086875 27.632625 you're just going to have to imagine what you would like as benefits
sw3001B-ms98-a-0012 27.632625 29.970875 [laughter]
sw3001B-ms98-a-0013 29.970875 39.620000 oh okay okay well in in interviewing have you ever discussed benefits with some of the potential employers
sw3001B-ms98-a-0014 39.620000 51.044000 didn't get that far you normally just try to sell them on your uh aptitude and not you know well how much vacation do i get oh well
sw3001B-ms98-a-0015 51.044000 58.888625 well i'll tell you a little bit about what TI has as benefits we do have uh like most companies we have medical insurance
sw3001B-ms98-a-0016 58.888625 69.728625 although they're tending to try to really cut costs more and more um what they started with a few years ago is that they only would allow you to go to um
sw3001B-ms98-a-0017 69.728625 74.699500 set hospitals in the area they call it network hospitals they're hos[pitals]-
sw3001B-ms98-a-0018 74.699500 85.421000 yeah they're hospitals that they're uh agreeing with uh TI that they'll be a certain rate you know for rooms and care and all that kind of stuff to keep co[sts]- you know costs down
sw3001B-ms98-a-0019 85.421000 92.763375 now they're going to start to do the same kind of thing with doctors so it's almost like a um uh an HMO
sw3001B-ms98-a-0020 92.763375 104.319500 you know kind of thing that uh only certain doctors are you going to be allowed to go to and get the full coverage if you go to a doctor who isn't in the network then it will be less benefits that you get
sw3001B-ms98-a-0021 104.319500 112.950125 we have some dental coverage now um but you have to pay a little more to really get something worthwhile Like i've had a couple of crowns recently and
sw3001B-ms98-a-0022 112.950125 122.505625 if you didn't have the extra dental plus um you only get like a third of your cost which can be kind of expensive with a crown so i i p[ay]-
sw3001B-ms98-a-0023 122.505625 126.315500 yeah i pay for the extra dental plus so much more per month
sw3001B-ms98-a-0024 126.315500 131.780375 because it always seems like if you're going to have a crown or something major done it pays a little more
sw3001B-ms98-a-0025 131.780375 140.558250 um we do have pension although i've realized recently that the pension doesn't seem to be too good and i know when you first start out working you're not thinking about that
sw3001B-ms98-a-0026 140.558250 142.481625 [laughter]
sw3001B-ms98-a-0027 142.481625 150.651625 after you've been working for a while and you look at your pension account and you go is that all that's in there i don't think's it's going to pay too long when i get out
sw3001B-ms98-a-0028 150.651625 155.003250 um we do have a new thing that they've started a few years ago um
sw3001B-ms98-a-0029 155.003250 169.499000 it's not an i R A it's called a four oh one K plan it's kind of like pension you put in so much money and then TI um meets you half way up to a certain maximum so like i put in a dollar they put in fifty cents so
sw3001B-ms98-a-0030 169.499000 177.731250 that grows pretty good and i think that will be more of something i can see of a pension than the regular pension plan
sw3001B-ms98-a-0031 177.731250 184.338000 course you can buy stock in the company but you know that's not always a real for sure kind of thing course
sw3001B-ms98-a-0032 184.338000 192.366375 yeah especially with this one you know it kind of goes up and down i don't know if it's any different than other companies but you hate to have it fluctuate and like
sw3001B-ms98-a-0033 192.366375 202.007875 you know last year it was forty dollars a share and now this year it's thirty six dollars a share and you go gee i'm losing money [laughter] doesn't quite feel as good
sw3001B-ms98-a-0034 202.007875 211.710250 and we get you know vacation normally after you're here for six months and you start to get like five days every six months is kind of how they accrue it to you
sw3001B-ms98-a-0035 211.710250 218.576750 and it's one nice thing about TI is after you've been here uh for five years you get three weeks
sw3001B-ms98-a-0036 218.576750 219.963875 which
sw3001B-ms98-a-0037 219.963875 225.492000 a lot of places make you work like ten years or so before you get that much
sw3001B-ms98-a-0038 225.492000 237.076250 and we get some we get uh decent holidays um we at Thanksgiving we always get the two days off which is nice to make a nice long weekend and at Christmas we always get two days at Christmas
sw3001B-ms98-a-0039 237.076250 241.438500 they float it around depending on which day of the week Christmas falls on
sw3001B-ms98-a-0040 241.438500 249.009375 so that's nice so you always get two days at Christmas a lot of people just take you know that week i normally take that week somehow you know
sw3001B-ms98-a-0041 249.009375 253.245125 you only have to take three days of vacation and you get the whole week at Christmas time
sw3001B-ms98-a-0042 253.245125 261.274875 [silence]
sw3001B-ms98-a-0043 261.274875 263.159375 whoa okay

sw3001B-ms98-a-0051 282.069875 284.675625 oh yeah
sw3001B-ms98-a-0052 284.675625 296.967625 yeah i think uh um i don't use the services but yeah i think sometime last year or just recently they started to give some kind of eye coverage you get discounts on uh glasses and
sw3001B-ms98-a-0053 296.967625 302.840000 i'm not quite sure there's certain places you can go to that have uh discounts for people that work here
sw3001B-ms98-a-0054 302.840000 308.130500 so you can get glasses and contacts and stuff through those particular stores or something like that
sw3001B-ms98-a-0055 308.130500 312.105875 [silence]

sw3001B-ms98-a-0066 334.859000 339.249875 [silence]
sw3001B-ms98-a-0067 339.249875 340.398750 yeah
sw3001B-ms98-a-0068 340.398750 355.207625 [silence]
sw3001B-ms98-a-0069 355.207625 358.229500 gee that's pretty decent
sw3001B-ms98-a-0070 358.229500 363.940750 [silence]
sw3001B-ms98-a-0071 363.940750 376.971000 right and you get some extra ones federal workers always seem to get you know you get Columbus Day and Veterans Day and those ones that you couldn't really care about so much but you get the day off anyhow
sw3001B-ms98-a-0072 376.971000 397.516125 [silence]
sw3001B-ms98-a-0073 397.516125 399.696750 oh yeah okay
sw3001B-ms98-a-0074 399.696750 408.280000 [silence]
sw3001B-ms98-a-0075 408.280000 416.640000 yeah we're doing an HMO right now um and when we go to get prescriptions it's five dollars
sw3001B-ms98-a-0076 416.640000 430.449625 so but so you know sometime sometimes when you go you know the prescription like my husband always takes [vocalized-noise] which is kind of like you know contact stuff only better um you that's like a buck a capsule
sw3001B-ms98-a-0077 430.449625 444.242125 so if you've got thirty in there it normally comes out to about thirty four dollars so when you pay five it's a pretty good savings then there's other times that you know maybe the prescription wouldn't cost more than like seven or eight dollars and you pay five anyhow
sw3001B-ms98-a-0078 444.242125 449.004000 so it isn't a percentage but sometimes you work you know you manage to make
