sw3015A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.948125 [silence]
sw3015A-ms98-a-0002 0.948125 2.199625 uh
sw3015A-ms98-a-0003 2.199625 7.514000 national health insurance i think is a problem
sw3015A-ms98-a-0004 7.514000 13.476000 in as much as the quality of health care that people will receive
sw3015A-ms98-a-0005 13.476000 24.842125 yeah because uh the articles that i've read regarding national health service in Canada and England has indicated that uh what
sw3015A-ms98-a-0006 24.842125 29.803625 stay stay in line for uh four hours to get an aspirin from a doctor
sw3015A-ms98-a-0007 29.803625 83.002000 [silence]
sw3015A-ms98-a-0008 83.002000 84.244500 um i see
sw3015A-ms98-a-0009 84.244500 93.495625 [silence]
sw3015A-ms98-a-0010 93.495625 94.610625 yeah
sw3015A-ms98-a-0011 94.610625 105.416125 like i think that uh again having gone through a period when i was out of work and had to buy health insurance on my own if you don't have a company supporting you
sw3015A-ms98-a-0012 105.416125 110.688875 in the uh picking up the major portion of your health insurance the cost is
sw3015A-ms98-a-0013 110.688875 112.372750 almost prohibitive
sw3015A-ms98-a-0014 112.372750 143.160000 [silence]
sw3015A-ms98-a-0015 143.160000 149.446000 yeah uh we're currently where i'm working now under Blue Cross
sw3015A-ms98-a-0016 149.446000 152.924250 i don't know what the total cost of the program is
sw3015A-ms98-a-0017 152.924250 156.959875 but for dependent coverage i'm paying a hundred and
sw3015A-ms98-a-0018 156.959875 170.596875 seventy dollars a a month or something like that so i assume that probably the total cov[erage]- cost is probably three fifty to four hundred they're probably picking up about half of it and that's a pretty good policy
sw3015A-ms98-a-0019 170.596875 174.292875 but if you had something like one of these uh
sw3015A-ms98-a-0020 174.292875 182.828750 health maintenance programs or one of whatever the type name is HMO uh where the
sw3015A-ms98-a-0021 182.828750 192.954000 uh where you go to the doctor and it only costs you ten dollars and the insurance picks up the rest if you tried to buy something like that i'm prob[able]- it would probably be five or six hundred dollars a month
sw3015A-ms98-a-0022 192.954000 194.908375 for just the cost of something
sw3015A-ms98-a-0023 194.908375 201.078500 [silence]
sw3015A-ms98-a-0024 201.078500 201.978250 yeah

sw3015A-ms98-a-0032 262.107750 263.817625 yeah that's right
sw3015A-ms98-a-0033 263.817625 281.000875 [silence]
sw3015A-ms98-a-0034 281.000875 282.637250 oh goodness [vocalized-noise]
sw3015A-ms98-a-0035 282.637250 289.279250 [silence]
sw3015A-ms98-a-0036 289.279250 291.620000 delivery room and everything
sw3015A-ms98-a-0037 291.620000 292.959750 yeah
sw3015A-ms98-a-0038 292.959750 317.606750 [silence]
sw3015A-ms98-a-0039 317.606750 318.418500 yeah

sw3015A-ms98-a-0041 320.701750 321.825375 yeah
sw3015A-ms98-a-0042 321.825375 325.520000 yeah
sw3015A-ms98-a-0043 325.520000 331.701625 as to a company's benefit to have a program like that because it keeps their employees healthy and on the job
sw3015A-ms98-a-0044 331.701625 332.259250 [noise]
sw3015A-ms98-a-0045 332.259250 335.537375 because they don't have to worry about going in and and paying
sw3015A-ms98-a-0046 335.537375 339.814625 uh seventy five dollars to have the doctor look at you for ten minutes
sw3015A-ms98-a-0047 339.814625 355.493875 [silence]
sw3015A-ms98-a-0048 355.493875 356.651750 yeah
sw3015A-ms98-a-0049 356.651750 371.482625 but here again the the doctor's practices in hospitals have gone become fairly sizeable businesses under themselves now uh you take a hospital uh the physical plant itself you have to pay your share of the operating of that
sw3015A-ms98-a-0050 371.482625 385.585250 eight story building uh when the rooms are empty so they spread the costs out over uh all the patient costs and uh that's how you come up with aspirin that costs four dollars apiece and things like that
sw3015A-ms98-a-0051 385.585250 392.549000 the horror stories that you hear about people going into the hospital for a week and uh it being a four thousand dollar bill
sw3015A-ms98-a-0052 392.549000 396.543375 [silence]
sw3015A-ms98-a-0053 396.543375 397.695500 right
sw3015A-ms98-a-0054 397.695500 405.316000 [silence]
sw3015A-ms98-a-0055 405.316000 407.877375 yeah yeah
sw3015A-ms98-a-0056 407.877375 417.351875 yeah my daughter and son-in-law had a baby here about uh what he he'll be three in August and uh their insurance plan that they're under
sw3015A-ms98-a-0057 417.351875 421.425375 encourages you to shorten your stay in the hospital
sw3015A-ms98-a-0058 421.425375 425.737375 and like she went in she had the baby and she was out in two days time
sw3015A-ms98-a-0059 425.737375 431.638625 and it was treated almost like it was an outpatient visit to the hospital the deductibles didn't apply
sw3015A-ms98-a-0060 431.638625 443.546250 and so that's one way one way the insurance companies are trying to hold costs down is by uh okay if you'll shorten your stay then we will uh waive the deductible
sw3015A-ms98-a-0061 443.546250 449.744000 [silence]
