sw3028B-ms98-a-0008 16.591250 23.128250 well i i really choose restaurants more for the quality of food than anything else
sw3028B-ms98-a-0009 23.128250 37.793000 well a little bit for the price but uh i think that as far as quality of food goes the m[ost]- some of the most expensive places i've been had the the really the the worst quality of food 
sw3028B-ms98-a-0010 37.793000 51.402625 really um a lot of places that even don't look don't look like much some of the some of the best food i have ever had was out of a outside or inside of a place that we drove up and i was like
sw3028B-ms98-a-0011 51.402625 59.304125 i'm not eating in there [laughter] are you nuts and uh we went in and it was the m[ost]- it was the most wonderful food

sw3028B-ms98-a-0025 100.987125 104.011250 uh i think so it should be
sw3028B-ms98-a-0026 104.011250 106.442375 uh it starts with a K
sw3028B-ms98-a-0027 106.442375 108.516000 so [laughter]
sw3028B-ms98-a-0028 108.516000 113.241500 K A L A i think C H A N D
sw3028B-ms98-a-0029 113.241500 116.000125 that should get you close enough to
sw3028B-ms98-a-0030 116.000125 120.592000 to be able to find it i think it's uh probably listed in the restaurants you know
sw3028B-ms98-a-0031 120.592000 123.919500 but it's uh it's just fabulous food

sw3028B-ms98-a-0053 221.603500 227.596875 i don't guess i've ever been to anything like that so i really don't have anything to compare it to
sw3028B-ms98-a-0054 227.596875 233.285125 it would be good i think uh i don't know how expensive they are it sounds like that it would probably
sw3028B-ms98-a-0055 233.285125 238.912625 [silence]
sw3028B-ms98-a-0056 238.912625 240.349625 for one person
sw3028B-ms98-a-0057 240.349625 241.832250 oh [laughter]
sw3028B-ms98-a-0058 241.832250 243.187625 a bit [laughter]

sw3028B-ms98-a-0060 251.448125 264.535750 see i i won't really be interested in going to going there because i feel like i'm i'm paying you know five dollars for the food probably and five dollars for something that i could get along quite well [laughter-without]
sw3028B-ms98-a-0061 264.535750 272.373250 [silence]
sw3028B-ms98-a-0062 272.373250 275.377875 yeah maybe maybe that yeah
sw3028B-ms98-a-0063 275.377875 278.531000 yeah i could see that then maybe
sw3028B-ms98-a-0064 278.531000 282.244500 [silence]
sw3028B-ms98-a-0065 282.244500 286.884000 yeah i like the the seafood that they when they had it you know the broiled
sw3028B-ms98-a-0066 286.884000 292.689125 [silence]
sw3028B-ms98-a-0067 292.689125 301.901500 yeah probably that's true but i know a lot of their a lot of their specials sometimes are fried things that you can't really get away from the fried
sw3028B-ms98-a-0068 301.901500 305.170250 [silence]
sw3028B-ms98-a-0069 305.170250 315.546500 now why would you go to a seafood restaurant to eat chicken that's one of my husband's pet peeves he doesn't understand why somebody would go to a seafood place and eat either chicken or steak you know
sw3028B-ms98-a-0070 315.546500 320.537750 [silence]
sw3028B-ms98-a-0071 320.537750 322.138375 oh really
sw3028B-ms98-a-0072 322.138375 326.365125 oh catfish is wonderful oh really

sw3028B-ms98-a-0074 327.665250 331.096875 [silence]
sw3028B-ms98-a-0075 331.096875 332.397750 why
sw3028B-ms98-a-0076 332.397750 333.744875 [silence]
sw3028B-ms98-a-0077 333.744875 335.459750 oh
sw3028B-ms98-a-0078 335.459750 339.219500 [silence]
sw3028B-ms98-a-0079 339.219500 340.579500 hum
sw3028B-ms98-a-0080 340.579500 344.968500 [silence]
sw3028B-ms98-a-0081 344.968500 350.130875 that's too bad because i'm probably not going to stop eating it [laughter]
sw3028B-ms98-a-0082 350.130875 364.291000 [silence]
sw3028B-ms98-a-0083 364.291000 366.595750 uh-huh yeah
sw3028B-ms98-a-0084 366.595750 369.963125 [silence]
sw3028B-ms98-a-0085 369.963125 371.383375 that's true
sw3028B-ms98-a-0086 371.383375 372.839000 [silence]
sw3028B-ms98-a-0087 372.839000 377.610625 oh on one hand i see that and on the other hand uh my older sister
sw3028B-ms98-a-0088 377.610625 382.511000 remembers when uh at one point they were taking radioactive wastes
sw3028B-ms98-a-0089 382.511000 391.395875 and storing them in tin barrels which i- i guess had a half-life of oh five years if they sit empty on dry land
sw3028B-ms98-a-0090 391.395875 401.358750 so they're putting radioactive waste in it which reduces it dramatically and then they take these things that will rust and they throw them in the ocean which is going to speedup the process even more
sw3028B-ms98-a-0091 401.358750 404.639875 [silence]
sw3028B-ms98-a-0092 404.639875 413.195250 oh and then they wouldn't sink they were floating around so they shot holes in them to sink them and this is before i was born
sw3028B-ms98-a-0093 413.195250 417.705250 so i mean we're taking thirty years ago this happened and
sw3028B-ms98-a-0094 417.705250 422.426250 and who's you know the tuna is radioactive
sw3028B-ms98-a-0095 422.426250 426.646750 to a certain extent you can't get away from it so i think
sw3028B-ms98-a-0096 426.646750 438.670625 to some point yeah you know so there's you know there's some things i think we can a[void]- we you know we can't avoid for health purposes and some things that we just need to like you know this is not in my control
sw3028B-ms98-a-0097 438.670625 445.636000 so i'm either going to be i'm either going to starve to death or i'm going to get over it and just go ahead and eat as healthily as i possibly can you know
sw3028B-ms98-a-0098 445.636000 449.748250 [silence]
