sw3061A-ms98-a-0015 37.414875 42.495875 is that right isn't that interesting [laughter] what color is your dog
sw3061A-ms98-a-0016 42.495875 56.095375 oh well ours is black so [laughter] definitely different [laughter] yes she's a female and she's um been she's been a really a really good companion for me um she's like a little shadow you know kind of follows me around all the time and 
sw3061A-ms98-a-0017 56.095375 65.148625 and um she's slowing down considerably she doesn't hear very well and she doesn't see very well but she's yeah at this age i guess so
sw3061A-ms98-a-0018 65.148625 73.011750 but um she's been a good dog to have and i don't know once she's gone i'm not sure if i'll get another animal or not [laughter]

sw3061A-ms98-a-0034 115.847875 117.086000 isn't that
sw3061A-ms98-a-0035 117.086000 131.378625 yes so that often happens that way well we had um intentionally um planned to get a dog we had just moved into this house and um decided to wait a about a year and then went then we went out then and found one she was in the litter and um
sw3061A-ms98-a-0036 131.378625 142.992000 she was so cute because [laughter] all the other little puppies in that litter were just crazy i mean they were all over the place and she was real docile and came over and just kind of sat next to us and i thought that's the dog for [laughter-me]
sw3061A-ms98-a-0037 142.992000 153.159125 [laughter] yeah so she and it what was funny was that um our daughter must have been let's see she must have been about eight at the time i guess and um
sw3061A-ms98-a-0038 153.159125 161.690000 she just loved this little dog to pieces but i think she loved her too much because the dog has never been real comfortable with her i think she was always a little bit leery of her
sw3061A-ms98-a-0039 161.690000 171.385250 our son on the other hand who was about eleven at the time was um not very interested in pets but as it turned out he and this dog have gotten to be really good pals
sw3061A-ms98-a-0040 171.385250 174.720500 so you just never know how that works out [laughter]

sw3061A-ms98-a-0055 211.478500 214.355500 [silence]
sw3061A-ms98-a-0056 214.355500 228.583250 uh-huh yes it's funny how um how pets can kind of um oh take on a certain status in certain areas i mean um that made me think of uh when our daughter was looking at colleges we visited a campus in um Saint Louis and
sw3061A-ms98-a-0057 228.583250 241.567750 um there were several dogs on the campus and and the what was interesting about it was that they were very friendly but they didn't appear to belong to anyone and um i'm sure someone you know fed them they were healthy looking dogs
sw3061A-ms98-a-0058 241.567750 255.753625 but um our guide that day said that the la[dy]- one woman uh many many years ago had given a huge sum of money to to the university on the condition that there be um dogs just kind of left to roam ar[ound]- around the campus
sw3061A-ms98-a-0059 255.753625 259.444125 which is the strangest thing i had ever heard [laughter]
sw3061A-ms98-a-0060 259.444125 261.190375 i know
sw3061A-ms98-a-0061 261.190375 262.509125 [silence]
sw3061A-ms98-a-0062 262.509125 264.487375 yes i know i[t]-
sw3061A-ms98-a-0063 264.487375 277.344375 yes it really was it was just a nice touch and it kind of made it seem more homy too [laughter] but um th[e]- i thought that was most unique and it just you know kind of goes along with what you were saying about the dog having sort of free run of the the nursing home
sw3061A-ms98-a-0064 277.344375 288.668250 so um but uh i this is the only pet we've had sin[ce]- you know in all our years of marriage um and it's been uh sort of a a change for my husband because as a a a boy growing up
sw3061A-ms98-a-0065 288.668250 301.365500 his father had dogs but they were always hunting dogs and so they were never allowed in the house you know they were always kind of yeah right [laughter] that's what he said yes so having a pet was a little bit different for him
sw3061A-ms98-a-0066 301.365500 306.248625 [silence]
sw3061A-ms98-a-0067 306.248625 307.466375 uh-huh
