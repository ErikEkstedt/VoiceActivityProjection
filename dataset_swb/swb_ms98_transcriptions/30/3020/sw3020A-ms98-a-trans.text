sw3020A-ms98-a-0013 50.487125 51.992875 [silence]
sw3020A-ms98-a-0014 51.992875 62.997875 uh well my husband is French and we were living in France at the time and we decided that i i've never been to Africa and i needed to get that continent [laughter]
sw3020A-ms98-a-0015 62.997875 68.640375 [laughter] hadn't been there yet and it it's actually it's a fairly common vacation place for
sw3020A-ms98-a-0016 68.640375 80.393125 French people to go and they speak French and so uh you know in that sense is just a little bit easier and it just seemed like it would be a fun place to go and
sw3020A-ms98-a-0017 80.393125 94.496625 so we we didn't really have enough time we had about a little bit less than two weeks and as always it don['t]- it seems a bit uh rushed we do a lot of traveling around we rented a car and drove pretty much everywhere
sw3020A-ms98-a-0018 94.496625 106.990000 no in fact some of the days we froze it was well we were there in the winter in Jan[uary]- uh January or February i don't remember which uh-huh

sw3020A-ms98-a-0024 119.490500 121.987625 oh that's too bad because
sw3020A-ms98-a-0025 121.987625 125.242375 [silence]
sw3020A-ms98-a-0026 125.242375 127.288250 uh-huh [noise]
sw3020A-ms98-a-0027 127.288250 134.231875 [noise]
sw3020A-ms98-a-0028 134.231875 142.994875 yeah it was a very interesting vacation the only thing i didn't like was in some of the more touristy areas uh um
sw3020A-ms98-a-0029 142.994875 153.317125 the it would just be besieged by people wanting to be your guide and you there were some places where people defini[te]- there would be kids there that were excellent at ripping you off
sw3020A-ms98-a-0030 153.317125 161.189375 and we had nothing taken because we knew and we had things in inside pockets and in you know in jacket underneath a coat type of thing but
sw3020A-ms98-a-0031 161.189375 162.499500 [silence]
sw3020A-ms98-a-0032 162.499500 163.765500 uh-huh

sw3020A-ms98-a-0035 181.988375 184.262500 [silence]
sw3020A-ms98-a-0036 184.262500 187.154500 [vocalized-noise] the the worst place was in Marrakech
sw3020A-ms98-a-0037 187.154500 196.144625 in the other cities it wasn't nearly as bad and a couple of them it was what we did in some of the other cities and they tell you to do that is to hire a local guide
sw3020A-ms98-a-0038 196.144625 206.303625 it doesn't matter who it is and they keep everyone else away from you and it's worth it and it's like ten dollars a day or something and its worth it just to keep everyone else away from badgering you
sw3020A-ms98-a-0039 206.303625 215.733500 and you feel stupid doing that but we did it and we were much happier and you also get in to see things that you might not get into if you were alone uh
sw3020A-ms98-a-0040 215.733500 216.748000 [silence]
sw3020A-ms98-a-0041 216.748000 227.621250 uh [laughter] yes no actually i haven't been all through Europe like i haven't been to Italy yet uh that we're going to go for a conference in September and so
sw3020A-ms98-a-0042 227.621250 234.498875 hopefully we'll get to travel a little bit too uh my more exciting spots have been i've been to the Galapagos Islands
sw3020A-ms98-a-0043 234.498875 241.588125 uh-huh that was one of the most wonderful vacations i've ever had yes if you like wildlife it's a fabulous vacation
sw3020A-ms98-a-0044 241.588125 255.765750 if you don't like wildlife it's probably not of interest [laughter] but it that was really really fabulous and just the photos i have of it and gosh incredible and be so close um August eighty eight
sw3020A-ms98-a-0045 255.765750 265.957750 and then actually after there i went to um Hawaii [noise] a lot of my travel has been sort of based around conferences or business meetings 
sw3020A-ms98-a-0046 265.957750 270.757875 and so i went to Hawaii and then to Australia
sw3020A-ms98-a-0047 270.757875 274.288625 and Japan and China
sw3020A-ms98-a-0048 274.288625 275.311000 [silence]
sw3020A-ms98-a-0049 275.311000 282.086625 i i actually i didn't go diving i i'm a diver and so that's that's actually been another of my
sw3020A-ms98-a-0050 282.086625 285.211375 favorite vacations has been taking little diving trips
sw3020A-ms98-a-0051 285.211375 298.266875 but uh no i didn't get to the Great Barrier Reef i drove from Sidney down to Melbourne and over to A[delaide]- Adelaide it's gorgeous absolutely gorgeous the coastline was just incredible it's huge
sw3020A-ms98-a-0052 298.266875 302.382500 Australia yeah uh but
sw3020A-ms98-a-0053 302.382500 308.738000 [silence]
sw3020A-ms98-a-0054 308.738000 311.481750 i don't remember if i had shrimp
sw3020A-ms98-a-0055 311.481750 313.485250 i don't think so
sw3020A-ms98-a-0056 313.485250 327.396375 [laughter] oh i like that too but uh in fact i didn't eat out that much there because i was traveling by myself in a car it would have been i think much more fun to do it like in the van with a bunch of people but uh
sw3020A-ms98-a-0057 327.396375 332.643625 uh-huh and i was by myself in China too yeah
sw3020A-ms98-a-0058 332.643625 345.741375 China was a little bit more uh of a challenge but it it wasn't more of a challenge in a sense because i hired a guide all the time and so i never you know got out by myself or not much
sw3020A-ms98-a-0059 345.741375 348.852750 no actually i paid about
sw3020A-ms98-a-0060 348.852750 351.999625 either a thousand dollars or a little bit
sw3020A-ms98-a-0061 351.999625 363.097875 no maybe it was about a thousand dollars maybe a little bit less i don't really remember for ten days including all my meals a guide a car the airfare and sorry but this is from Hong Kong
sw3020A-ms98-a-0062 363.097875 370.995625 because i was already in Hong Kong and um but it only cost you about a thousand dollars to go there and i went to Beijing
sw3020A-ms98-a-0063 370.995625 379.409750 Shanghai Chengdu and actually then i took a train up from Shanghai to a little Quingdao i think is the name of it it's a little
sw3020A-ms98-a-0064 379.409750 389.708625 uh sort of getaway retreat village not far from Shanghai it's just a train ride and that i had two internal one yeah two internal plane flights
sw3020A-ms98-a-0065 389.708625 395.739875 and a couple of other things it was really [vocalized-noise] uh-huh around a thousand
sw3020A-ms98-a-0066 395.739875 397.278250 [silence]
sw3020A-ms98-a-0067 397.278250 399.770000 oh Japa[n]- Japan's ridiculous
sw3020A-ms98-a-0068 399.770000 409.288750 and i stayed i didn't stay in the top of the line hotels but i stayed in they were all completely clean and you know they were newly built and
sw3020A-ms98-a-0069 409.288750 410.316000 [silence]
sw3020A-ms98-a-0070 410.316000 415.992000 they were sort of the lower end of the top of the line hotels because they said you can't stay in the cheap stuff
sw3020A-ms98-a-0071 415.992000 418.776750 [silence]
sw3020A-ms98-a-0072 418.776750 420.292125 right
sw3020A-ms98-a-0073 420.292125 421.345750 [silence]
sw3020A-ms98-a-0074 421.345750 422.998125 right
sw3020A-ms98-a-0075 422.998125 432.763000 uh but yeah that was tha[t]- i highly recommend that way to go if you're ever interested in going the route i dealt with this woman her name was Rita at China Tours in Boston
sw3020A-ms98-a-0076 432.763000 446.999375 yeah um and a friend of mine who had gone for a business trip to China and she just gave me this woman's name to contact and it would really be fun i think ideally with like two couples because you have a car and a driver
sw3020A-ms98-a-0077 446.999375 450.438125 and a guide and then
