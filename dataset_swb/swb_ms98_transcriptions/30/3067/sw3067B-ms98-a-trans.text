sw3067B-ms98-a-0012 57.807375 69.207500 i[t]- i[t]- it was a big deal but uh they they tried to to centralize it in one spot so in the past couple of years they had it at um a state park every year

sw3067B-ms98-a-0019 110.960000 117.235250 the family has not uh on her side my mother's side has not seen you know my daughter so
sw3067B-ms98-a-0020 117.235250 118.984250 [silence]
sw3067B-ms98-a-0021 118.984250 120.729750 i have one brother
sw3067B-ms98-a-0022 120.729750 122.234375 so
sw3067B-ms98-a-0023 122.234375 123.567125 yes
sw3067B-ms98-a-0024 123.567125 126.175375 [silence]
sw3067B-ms98-a-0025 126.175375 128.040375 right yeah
sw3067B-ms98-a-0026 128.040375 132.488625 right i- i usually see her a couple times a year so that's no no
sw3067B-ms98-a-0027 132.488625 136.040250 no thing but uh i uh
sw3067B-ms98-a-0028 136.040250 146.913250 i do i do enjoy the reunions the only problem is that now um or[iginally]- originally when we had them uh they were mainly my mother's
sw3067B-ms98-a-0029 146.913250 147.972500 [silence]
sw3067B-ms98-a-0030 147.972500 153.956250 uh father's my mother's father's family had quite a few uh
sw3067B-ms98-a-0031 153.956250 161.132750 brothers and sisters so it was a large reunion of of of of that group uh from that {descendancy}
sw3067B-ms98-a-0032 161.132750 167.741875 and uh a lot of those people have and and at time you know they all knew one another
sw3067B-ms98-a-0033 167.741875 178.737125 and now it's gotten uh that uh a lot of those people are d[ied]- have uh have died off or you know what we are left with is the the relatives of of of that group
sw3067B-ms98-a-0034 178.737125 189.784000 and so uh it's not quite as close as it used to be so i think people feel less of a of a desire to really go i know that
sw3067B-ms98-a-0035 189.784000 191.927250 [silence]
sw3067B-ms98-a-0036 191.927250 201.819500 [noise] well i- i just think that uh you know at that ti[me]- when when they were you know [vocalized-noise] those were all brothers and sisters a lot and
sw3067B-ms98-a-0037 201.819500 210.234750 or they were all in the same ar[ea]- geographical location you know back back around you know in the twenties and thirties when they were growing up
sw3067B-ms98-a-0038 210.234750 215.034250 um you know they were all located to[gether]- together in one small community
sw3067B-ms98-a-0039 215.034250 219.975750 [noise] and as as time grew [vocalized-noise] i mean time went on
sw3067B-ms98-a-0040 219.975750 231.290625 the family grew and moved away and so forth and now when you when you they come together it's it's generally you know like say the ki[ds]- kids of those people who are not
sw3067B-ms98-a-0041 231.290625 238.203750 you know anywhere near one another and i don't think they feel the the the closeness that they that used to be there
sw3067B-ms98-a-0042 238.203750 246.741375 which is a shame but that's just how it is my mother was complaining last year about the you know it's dwindling down every year you know that's just i think that's just
sw3067B-ms98-a-0043 246.741375 253.083375 [silence]
sw3067B-ms98-a-0044 253.083375 254.723125 well yeah
sw3067B-ms98-a-0045 254.723125 259.309250 yeah that's uh yeah i think that's some of it but i- you know i 
sw3067B-ms98-a-0046 259.309250 271.163375 [vocalized-noise] i- i it's just the way you know i think s[ociety]- society is now is that we are not we don't have the extensive family we used to it's more of a you know s[maller]- a smaller
sw3067B-ms98-a-0047 271.163375 284.497750 smaller unit and you know we we tend to try to do things i think with with our immediate family as opposed to this extended family of people that we may or may not remember or know you know very well uh
sw3067B-ms98-a-0048 284.497750 286.985250 [silence]
sw3067B-ms98-a-0049 286.985250 291.938500 right it requires a lot of effort t[o]- t[o]- t[o]- to do that sort of thing i mean i
sw3067B-ms98-a-0050 291.938500 302.260000 i used to enjoy going i mean i still do kind of enjoy it but uh it's it doesn't you know it's not as many people there that i really really enjoy seeing
sw3067B-ms98-a-0051 302.260000 308.305250 you know i it's going just for the sake of getting together i think for the family and
sw3067B-ms98-a-0052 308.305250 310.867750 [silence]
sw3067B-ms98-a-0053 310.867750 312.584500 uh

sw3067B-ms98-a-0055 313.621875 319.301625 um um no not really tha[t]- in that but then again uh
sw3067B-ms98-a-0056 319.301625 326.998875 well i you know i have some aunts that uh i- i- i- i do that's about [vocalized-noise] my mother's sisters
sw3067B-ms98-a-0057 326.998875 336.017250 you know but i feel closer to them because i kind of grew up with them but but uh as for the you know for the rest of that group no not really
sw3067B-ms98-a-0058 336.017250 345.443625 uh you know and and generally when i was growing up a lot of those people the only time i ever saw them was at the reunion so uh you don't really feel that
sw3067B-ms98-a-0059 345.443625 347.565875 that really close to them_1
sw3067B-ms98-a-0060 347.565875 361.684625 [silence]
