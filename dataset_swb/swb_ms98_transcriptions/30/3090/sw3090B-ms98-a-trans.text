sw3090B-ms98-a-0003 5.379875 18.357750 no i don't use a family budget my father who's very old has kept one his entire life and i probably re[belled]- rebelled against it and probably should have kept one he keeps every penny that comes in and goes out
sw3090B-ms98-a-0004 18.357750 20.619500 on a very strict percentage
sw3090B-ms98-a-0005 20.619500 40.064000 [silence]
sw3090B-ms98-a-0006 40.064000 41.425125 right
sw3090B-ms98-a-0007 41.425125 42.130500 [noise]
sw3090B-ms98-a-0008 42.130500 46.329125 i think it makes much more sense and i've recently uh
sw3090B-ms98-a-0009 46.329125 53.124750 gotten out of debt and everything and i'll probably kee[ping]- start keeping a little better track of it i just uh
sw3090B-ms98-a-0010 53.124750 61.360375 spent whatever came in and and uh didn['t]- never knew what came in what went out but uh just you know like about_1 like the government runs
sw3090B-ms98-a-0011 61.360375 62.680875 huh
sw3090B-ms98-a-0012 62.680875 74.672875 so i think it's probably better to have some sort of a a at least a record but my dad's was so precise that i mean if it said to spend eleven percent on something that's what it was spent and
sw3090B-ms98-a-0013 74.672875 79.821500 that was put over there and i mean uh of course he's from the depression and uh
sw3090B-ms98-a-0014 79.821500 87.141625 so uh you know it's his life but uh i i would i think it'd be smart if somebody would keep uh
sw3090B-ms98-a-0015 87.141625 90.011375 some sort of a plan that works for them
sw3090B-ms98-a-0016 90.011375 104.732500 [silence]
sw3090B-ms98-a-0017 104.732500 110.836000 yeah it is [noise] i'm a historian and my father had kept them_1 i think since nineteen twenty seven and
sw3090B-ms98-a-0018 110.836000 119.355625 but he burned the ones from twenty seven to fi[fty]- i couldn't believe he did that but then so i took the ones from fifty two on to the present but
sw3090B-ms98-a-0019 119.355625 126.043875 to look to have looked back into the twenties and thirties and forties it would have been fantastic to see that but uh
sw3090B-ms98-a-0020 126.043875 136.485875 [silence]

sw3090B-ms98-a-0027 160.631000 169.459625 i know well even in nineteen sixty three i found a a record that i had [vocalized-noise] had traveled in Europe a lot and i what i'd paid for hotels
sw3090B-ms98-a-0028 169.459625 182.990250 and a similar hotel in Paris is two hundred dollars a night now and i paid uh oh between four and five dollars in nineteen sixty and that's really crazy because_1 that's about thirty years ago
sw3090B-ms98-a-0029 182.990250 184.347375 [silence]
sw3090B-ms98-a-0030 184.347375 192.772125 oh b[ut]- but of course it's just what the market'll bear and if pe[ople]- if people will pay two hundred then why charge ten you know yeah
sw3090B-ms98-a-0031 192.772125 195.996250 right right that

sw3090B-ms98-a-0037 225.838375 238.152875 she may marry somebody and of course it'd be good because if you marry somebody a little loose then she'll have that stability of watching uh you should have one in the in the in the house and i think
