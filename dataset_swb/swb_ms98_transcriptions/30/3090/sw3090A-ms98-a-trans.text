sw3090A-ms98-a-0010 19.929625 31.593375 yes well um we sort of started doing it years and years ago and my husband started graduate school when we were first married and i sort of just got in the habit i guess and you know and never have gotten out of it
sw3090A-ms98-a-0011 31.593375 43.304125 i can't really say that it's a formal budget it's more just a a pretty um a fairly uh a[ccurate]- accurate um recording of what i spend and what i think i'm going to have to spend and
sw3090A-ms98-a-0012 43.304125 44.795500 yeah
sw3090A-ms98-a-0013 44.795500 50.082000 [silence]

sw3090A-ms98-a-0028 89.225125 100.725625 yeah i think you're right um well i[t]- it what's been sort of interesting to us is to um it because since i have uh pretty much kept my record books for the last fifteen years i guess
sw3090A-ms98-a-0029 100.725625 106.786000 i can go back and look and it's real fun to just see wh[at]- how things have changed over the years uh for ins[tance]-
sw3090A-ms98-a-0030 106.786000 109.929250 [silence]

sw3090A-ms98-a-0038 125.179125 133.510750 well as a matter of fact uh my mother was going through some things uh not lon[g]- long ago i guess it's been a couple of years [vocalized-noise] in an old trunk that she had 
sw3090A-ms98-a-0039 133.510750 144.966875 and she came upon a b[udget]- a budget book that she'd had back in the thirties uh when they it was the late well i guess it would have been i take that back it must have been the forties because they had been married uh probably fifteen years at the time
sw3090A-ms98-a-0040 144.966875 154.897375 and it was just f[ascinating]- uh fascinating to see how little things cost i mean it was it was just almost laughable in some instances that you know of course it's all relative of course but
sw3090A-ms98-a-0041 154.897375 163.614250 uh never the less it was fun to see those figures next to you know for a pr[ice]- pair of shoes was uh like five dollars and [laughter]
sw3090A-ms98-a-0042 163.614250 168.796375 [silence]

sw3090A-ms98-a-0049 181.960875 185.887875 really oh that is that is really really something

sw3090A-ms98-a-0051 186.975375 188.526500 that's true
sw3090A-ms98-a-0052 188.526500 190.058625 [silence]
sw3090A-ms98-a-0053 190.058625 194.730750 yeah that's g[ood]- that's right that's exa[ctly]- that's just good old economics working [laughter]
sw3090A-ms98-a-0054 194.730750 209.202375 well uh we've tried to uh instill some se[nse]- some sense of uh of budgeting in our kids but our two children are just uh as um unlike as n[ight]- night and day and our son could care less about a budget and our daughter watches her pennies so closely that
sw3090A-ms98-a-0055 209.202375 218.498375 she almost she almost just sounds like your father i mean she has everything planned so cl[osely]- closely that if something goes wrong it just throws her for a [laughter-loop]
sw3090A-ms98-a-0056 218.498375 220.765500 [silence]
sw3090A-ms98-a-0057 220.765500 222.305125 yes
sw3090A-ms98-a-0058 222.305125 224.970375 right yes
sw3090A-ms98-a-0059 224.970375 226.621750 yes
sw3090A-ms98-a-0060 226.621750 233.261750 [silence]
sw3090A-ms98-a-0061 233.261750 234.943125 yeah
sw3090A-ms98-a-0062 234.943125 237.444125 i think that's true i and and it's
sw3090A-ms98-a-0063 237.444125 250.013500 i kind of think that's sort of what happened in our house because i think my husband was not quite as uh good at saving and so on before we got married and i was i was really diligent about that i always putting money aside and when before i was married you know when i was working in and out of college and
sw3090A-ms98-a-0064 250.013500 260.003875 uh that really paid off because when it time came for him to go back to graduate school we were in in in fairly good g[ood]- shape financially as far as not having many major debts and
sw3090A-ms98-a-0065 260.003875 261.359250 yeah
sw3090A-ms98-a-0066 261.359250 262.506250 [silence]
sw3090A-ms98-a-0067 262.506250 266.539375 [laughter]
sw3090A-ms98-a-0068 266.539375 267.822500 well
sw3090A-ms98-a-0069 267.822500 278.124125 uh he is an engineer he's uh an electrical engineer and in fact went through uh many years of graduate school and got his PhD so we had a a lot of lot of years of budgeting [laughter]
sw3090A-ms98-a-0070 278.124125 281.512250 and you know yeah when you
sw3090A-ms98-a-0071 281.512250 283.280250 uh yes
sw3090A-ms98-a-0072 283.280250 296.118375 well i'm working i'm working on my masters degree now so in fact this last year we had three t[wo]- both of the children were in college our son has a year left our daughter graduated this year and i'm uh just about ready to finish my masters degree so
sw3090A-ms98-a-0073 296.118375 300.204000 we've had uh once again you know some really a real lean year for us
sw3090A-ms98-a-0074 300.204000 302.175250 but uh
sw3090A-ms98-a-0075 302.175250 306.991625 yep yeah you know exactly what it's what it's like then and it's uh
sw3090A-ms98-a-0076 306.991625 316.099500 which you learn i guess you figure that that's an investment that is um really a in[valuable]- invaluable um-hum yeah and
sw3090A-ms98-a-0077 316.099500 325.631000 that's right so it's it's one that you can live through and i think that that's way we looked at it in our beginnings when my husband was in graduate school is that there was a light at the end of that tunnel you know that
sw3090A-ms98-a-0078 325.631000 338.232875 that it was worth it to save and then not have uh something and uh in return know that something better was going to be at the end of it so uh it really makes it easier but uh well i've enjoyed talking with you Jay 
sw3090A-ms98-a-0079 338.232875 344.509750 and i- i wish i could hear more about your historian part of your life because that sounds really fascinating to me i'm interested in that
