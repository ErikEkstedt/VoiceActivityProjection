sw3027A-ms98-a-0009 112.982750 115.197750 uh well i'm
sw3027A-ms98-a-0010 115.197750 120.005750 i'm kind of with you they've they've definitely run into some problems and i think it's
sw3027A-ms98-a-0011 120.005750 127.682750 it's some it's it's due to their own shortsightedness uh perhaps the trying to do
sw3027A-ms98-a-0012 127.682750 133.915750 too much too quickly uh and you know they take [vocalized-noise] take some
sw3027A-ms98-a-0013 133.915750 141.831000 [vocalized-noise] i think that they th[ought]- thought that they were going to get a lot more done quickly than they then they really did they didn't think out all of the
sw3027A-ms98-a-0014 141.831000 144.426875 the variables that uh that might
sw3027A-ms98-a-0015 144.426875 156.626500 crop up and then they've been hit with a lot of those uh a lot of i think they've had a lot of poorer ma[nagement]- poor management here in the past uh several years no no clearly defined goals uh
sw3027A-ms98-a-0016 156.626500 158.436875 uh a
sw3027A-ms98-a-0017 158.436875 167.070125 [vocalized-noise] and and goals that are that were obtainable you know th[ey]- they they needed to look at the long long range picture i think that that
sw3027A-ms98-a-0018 167.070125 174.179500 uh the Soviets have have done a better job of that you know they they were very uh
sw3027A-ms98-a-0019 174.179500 182.292125 they were limited so much in their technology and but they because of that they they tended to say what we're going to do what we do
sw3027A-ms98-a-0020 182.292125 187.102625 and continue to do it and do it over the long haul and so that's what they've done and they've
sw3027A-ms98-a-0021 187.102625 194.820625 they've uh you know they they've had a man in s[pace]- in space for you know a quite a long time you know in in in
sw3027A-ms98-a-0022 194.820625 205.279250 in the different space stations that they've had and uh so that tha[t]- you know that's been good for them they've learned a lot and they've they've made some achievements in in that respect but they['ve]- they've been
sw3027A-ms98-a-0023 205.279250 208.983125 doing it very slowly and very long range you know
sw3027A-ms98-a-0024 208.983125 214.010125 and we haven't done that we tend to to look at uh a big uh
sw3027A-ms98-a-0025 214.010125 224.545875 a big project that we like to to have done you know [vocalized-noise] you know do the shuttle thing and and and [vocalized-noise] have it as a you know a space transport system
sw3027A-ms98-a-0026 224.545875 228.298625 you know up in the next ten years and you can't do that you know i mean it's just not
sw3027A-ms98-a-0027 228.298625 234.165125 not f[easible]- feasible but you know the Americans uh American publics doesn't like to sit back and wait
sw3027A-ms98-a-0028 234.165125 237.793875 you know ten years for something to get developed and and put up [vocalized-noise]
sw3027A-ms98-a-0029 237.793875 241.197500 w[ith]- w[ith]- especially with funding the way it is yeah
sw3027A-ms98-a-0030 241.197500 245.688500 uh i uh i think there are definite benefits from from the from
sw3027A-ms98-a-0031 245.688500 255.818625 the process of of creating space projects you know we you know we've seen that in terms of computers and and the the myriad of different uh
sw3027A-ms98-a-0032 255.818625 258.508375 technological advances but
sw3027A-ms98-a-0033 258.508375 270.445500 uh like you say you have to kind of weigh that as to what is it worth in the long you know for for the overall uh picture uh how much we willing to to put out for
sw3027A-ms98-a-0034 270.445500 275.004250 to have Teflon on our on our our cooking pans and [laughter]

sw3027A-ms98-a-0043 371.296250 383.795125 you know i i mean i would love to see you know big things like that happen i me[an]- i've you know i've i went through the entire and i grew up in that early sixties you know big big boom of
sw3027A-ms98-a-0044 383.795125 395.345875 of uh you know all those Mercury and Gemini and uh Apollo shots and and and was real caught up in that and would love to see something
sw3027A-ms98-a-0045 395.345875 404.998625 big happen you know i'd like to see that that occur but yo[u]- like you say it's it's a it i[s]- it is a drain and you don't it would cost
sw3027A-ms98-a-0046 404.998625 418.258375 an enormous amount of money to put that up yeah put something up like a space station that would work and really really be beneficial for us and uh i don't i don't know it's if it's worth it
