sw3027B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 11.953750 the space program seems to have run into a little bit of a snag funding wise anyway they've decided the space station's not may not be worth it and uh they're going to fight over that for a few years it seems
sw3027B-ms98-a-0002 11.953750 19.829125 and uh just the idea of flight uh the shuttle system and what they thought they could do and what they're ending up doing and
sw3027B-ms98-a-0003 19.829125 27.053000 the complexity and the seeming uh number of errors and breakdowns and problems they're having with it uh it may not be
sw3027B-ms98-a-0004 27.053000 36.834125 common thing all too soon and even if they ever do get it common uh or get it to where you know the a large percentage or even a
sw3027B-ms98-a-0005 36.834125 44.055125 a one to two percent of of a given nation ends up in space f[or]- for some reason or another um
sw3027B-ms98-a-0006 44.055125 52.096625 they haven't solved and i don't know if they can solve the problem that weightlessness has extended weightlessness has on the human body i mean
sw3027B-ms98-a-0007 52.096625 62.490750 we can do all we want as far as technology goes but if a human can't stand to be up there then what good does is it to have the station that for extended stays if you can't stand an extended stay
sw3027B-ms98-a-0008 62.490750 68.663375 so i don't know if uh if all the monies that are being spent on it uh
sw3027B-ms98-a-0009 68.663375 79.219000 really should be spent with the idea of uh or with the goal of of the space station or of claiming a sector of space or having defense out in space
sw3027B-ms98-a-0010 79.219000 92.438250 i don't mind spending the money from the standpoint of uh basically government funded uh research and development and you know it's tends to create jobs our our economy
sw3027B-ms98-a-0011 92.438250 103.580250 tends to be uh based on a lot of a lot of that lately of course it really wreaks havoc with the economy when the government decides to shut down things like bases and and uh
sw3027B-ms98-a-0012 103.580250 106.892375 like [vocalized-noise] Carswell and things of that nature
sw3027B-ms98-a-0013 106.892375 112.985875 so what do you think about the the uh whole space program as it were
sw3027B-ms98-a-0014 112.985875 162.328375 [silence]
sw3027B-ms98-a-0015 162.328375 163.731000 um-hum
sw3027B-ms98-a-0016 163.731000 196.923250 [silence]
sw3027B-ms98-a-0017 196.923250 198.289750 right
sw3027B-ms98-a-0018 198.289750 208.573250 [silence]
sw3027B-ms98-a-0019 208.573250 209.975875 um-hum
sw3027B-ms98-a-0020 209.975875 239.798000 [silence]
sw3027B-ms98-a-0021 239.798000 241.082125 right
sw3027B-ms98-a-0022 241.082125 272.826000 [silence]
sw3027B-ms98-a-0023 272.826000 274.250750 right
sw3027B-ms98-a-0024 274.250750 280.858750 you know you really don't want the economy to or the space program to become a too large percentage of the economy
sw3027B-ms98-a-0025 280.858750 294.362750 so that when something catas[trophe]- some catastrophe does occur and it does have to be curtailed y[ou]- you don't gut the economy sort of like the defense industry problem has has occurred uh as as needs changed in the defense world then
sw3027B-ms98-a-0026 294.362750 302.695000 you go and cut back on your spending and it cripples whole sections of the nation as it were with the lack of jobs and lack of whatever else
sw3027B-ms98-a-0027 302.695000 314.167250 you do that with the space program and now as complex and as many different directions as they're being tugged with technology uh they want to be so big that if we ever did allow that um
sw3027B-ms98-a-0028 314.167250 319.687125 uh we're liable to be in the same boat and once these contracts are finished or if the space
sw3027B-ms98-a-0029 319.687125 332.010750 [pra/platform] platform disintegrated for whatever reason uh maybe there'd be that many thousands of jobs that were supplying [prats/parts] you know parts to that that weren't there anymore you'd have to go back to the jobs that needed to
sw3027B-ms98-a-0030 332.010750 342.048250 be there when that was being created instead of being sustained and you know y[ou]- you can't have uh a quarter of the economy resting on one little project up there
sw3027B-ms98-a-0031 342.048250 349.475125 so i[t]- it gets kind of complicated when you start talk[ing]- getting that big plus you get so many different directions uh
sw3027B-ms98-a-0032 349.475125 355.366875 not being limited by technology here in the US but being limited by the whims of changing funding
sw3027B-ms98-a-0033 355.366875 367.974250 uh it needs even that much more or or better management from uh the NASA people to keep a clear goal and a relatively a reasonable one in sight as it were
sw3027B-ms98-a-0034 367.974250 372.500500 so i don't know it's a it's a complex issue but
sw3027B-ms98-a-0035 372.500500 383.432000 [silence]
sw3027B-ms98-a-0036 383.432000 384.842375 um-hum
sw3027B-ms98-a-0037 384.842375 416.787375 [silence]
sw3027B-ms98-a-0038 416.787375 431.131875 well they keep talking about uh the space station the biggest thing they want to do up there is is test out different manufacturing techniques uh in weightlessness but are these i- i never could quite figure out whether these techniques were something that could be done
sw3027B-ms98-a-0039 431.131875 442.456250 uh uh simulated or we learn enough about it to do it down here on earth or are we talking about having to build some sort of a station that is going to produce these products and how much could you really produce in a lab up there
sw3027B-ms98-a-0040 442.456250 449.667750 uh i don't i don't really guess i understand what they're going to do unless they're going to turn out product from that
