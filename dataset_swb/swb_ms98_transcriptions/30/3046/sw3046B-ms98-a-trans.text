sw3046B-ms98-a-0022 66.312500 71.947375 well uh the thing that i found interesting my husband and i lived up in Washington state for awhile
sw3046B-ms98-a-0023 71.947375 83.183625 and up there of course they ate a lot of sea food and that kind of thing and down here sea food is pretty expensive because you have to ship it a long way to get it [laughter]
sw3046B-ms98-a-0024 83.183625 94.299250 right and and uh and but here we eat a lot of like Mexican foods and um up there there was no no place that we went tasted like real Mexican food to me
sw3046B-ms98-a-0025 94.299250 99.488500 yeah it tasted like they were trying to do the best they could but it just didn't taste right
sw3046B-ms98-a-0026 99.488500 101.051375 yeah [laughter]
sw3046B-ms98-a-0027 101.051375 110.859375 and uh down here we eat a lot more fried foods i think like chicken fried steak is a real big thing and up there uh it was hardly ever heard of and
sw3046B-ms98-a-0028 110.859375 113.760375 we drink ice tea with every meal and
sw3046B-ms98-a-0029 113.760375 117.109125 up there hardly anyone drank ice tea [laughter]

sw3046B-ms98-a-0035 126.538375 133.719000 yeah but when when we have a dinner party around here i think a lot of the time a Mexican menu is something real popular

sw3046B-ms98-a-0037 135.053000 144.713500 i know that um i do a lot of planning with our church and a lot of the times when we get together well everybody will bring a Mexican dish or and Italian food is real big too

sw3046B-ms98-a-0063 218.624250 221.223125 that probably makes it easier but
sw3046B-ms98-a-0064 221.223125 227.757250 yeah we find ourselves eating a lot of macaroni and cheese and uh [laughter] and of course
sw3046B-ms98-a-0065 227.757250 230.230250 [silence]
sw3046B-ms98-a-0066 230.230250 232.052250 uh
sw3046B-ms98-a-0067 232.052250 238.967750 right yeah well that's pretty much what we do if dad's not coming home we have macaroni and cheese or something
sw3046B-ms98-a-0068 238.967750 249.498125 but they like uh spaghetti you know that's one meal i can fix and the whole family eats but there are several things that well as a matter of fact i keep chicken nuggets handy all the time because
sw3046B-ms98-a-0069 249.498125 258.918125 yeah the children love them and uh they are real easy to cook and that way whatever meat we have if they don't like it well and my girls don't like beef i don't know
sw3046B-ms98-a-0070 258.918125 260.266375 i guess
sw3046B-ms98-a-0071 260.266375 261.280375 [silence]
sw3046B-ms98-a-0072 261.280375 268.565000 well yeah it could be bec[ause]- they don't i think it's the texture of it but it takes more chewing [laughter] and
sw3046B-ms98-a-0073 268.565000 270.354375 uh-huh
sw3046B-ms98-a-0074 270.354375 271.788000 right
sw3046B-ms98-a-0075 271.788000 280.271000 right so they're not too much into beef and my husband and i eat more beef than we should but at least we keep our chicken nuggets handy for them [laughter]
sw3046B-ms98-a-0076 280.271000 283.647750 [silence]

sw3046B-ms98-a-0081 302.671000 306.144500 my husband and i do a lot of the planning in that and
sw3046B-ms98-a-0082 306.144500 312.401375 yeah it is and it's fun to uh i like just having a pot luck meal where everyone brings their favorite dish
