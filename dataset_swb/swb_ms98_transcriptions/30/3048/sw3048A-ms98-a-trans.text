sw3048A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 13.850250 the uh Vietnam War was uh certainly expensive not only in in cost but in uh the long term effects as far as lives go uh when i was oh seven or eight years old and
sw3048A-ms98-a-0002 13.850250 26.538625 just into uh first or second grade or so i was sitting there wondering whether this war would ever stop and whether it'd last another five or six years and i would end up in it and uh i- i kept a little bit of an eye on it i had older
sw3048A-ms98-a-0003 26.538625 40.167500 sisters that wasn't was not worried about going in to it but they had boy friends and the like that were concerned and so it struck home a little bit from that standpoint we didn't have any service people in Vietnam there in the immediate family so
sw3048A-ms98-a-0004 40.167500 41.632875 uh
sw3048A-ms98-a-0005 41.632875 48.512250 just the whole idea though of of what we were over there for and uh the very unpopular
sw3048A-ms98-a-0006 48.512250 62.431500 problems that occurred here the riots and the protests and uh it just didn't seem to go over well with the general public like the last one did uh it it raised it to the forefront of of a lot of our thinking back then so
sw3048A-ms98-a-0007 62.431500 76.106750 uh i- i would tend to say that it was not worth it but then it's easier looking back at at the fact that we virtually lost if you want to call it that it's easy to say well yeah it was not worth it considering the results now had we won and it had been quick
sw3048A-ms98-a-0008 76.106750 79.010250 uh maybe it would've been different but
sw3048A-ms98-a-0009 79.010250 80.336125 [silence]
sw3048A-ms98-a-0010 80.336125 86.153750 i'm not really all that familiar i never was a Vietnam buff i'm not all that familiar with the beginning of it
sw3048A-ms98-a-0011 86.153750 94.811750 [silence]
sw3048A-ms98-a-0012 94.811750 98.771000 well do you think the reasons are any different than than what they did in
sw3048A-ms98-a-0013 98.771000 101.309125 [silence]
sw3048A-ms98-a-0014 101.309125 104.722250 uh just somebody invaded and they decided to go help huh

sw3048A-ms98-a-0024 146.288625 149.265500 yeah and i never thought about that the news coverage might be
sw3048A-ms98-a-0025 149.265500 150.725375 worse than
sw3048A-ms98-a-0026 150.725375 152.858500 it you would be better off not knowing i guess
sw3048A-ms98-a-0027 152.858500 159.460625 [silence]
sw3048A-ms98-a-0028 159.460625 160.970000 yeah

sw3048A-ms98-a-0035 181.004125 181.977125 that's true

sw3048A-ms98-a-0037 184.813750 185.677000 yeah

sw3048A-ms98-a-0039 188.985250 193.626500 yeah it makes you wonder if if they'd had the same mentality in Nam if they'd have been able to
sw3048A-ms98-a-0040 193.626500 197.695375 to just wipe out the thing you know go all out as it were
sw3048A-ms98-a-0041 197.695375 198.969875 yeah
sw3048A-ms98-a-0042 198.969875 209.039625 [silence]

sw3048A-ms98-a-0047 215.550000 221.203000 the business about not going into Cambodia was that's bad news [laughter] that's right
sw3048A-ms98-a-0048 221.203000 222.634500 so
sw3048A-ms98-a-0049 222.634500 223.490000 just
sw3048A-ms98-a-0050 223.490000 227.846750 blow up any part of the country that they are occupying regardless of the boundaries
sw3048A-ms98-a-0051 227.846750 231.293375 [silence]
sw3048A-ms98-a-0052 231.293375 232.361500 yep
sw3048A-ms98-a-0053 232.361500 238.605000 [silence]
sw3048A-ms98-a-0054 238.605000 239.429875 hum

sw3048A-ms98-a-0056 240.580750 241.734375 well that's uh
sw3048A-ms98-a-0057 241.734375 249.560750 i wonder what the i have not even looked at the cost i wonder if the cost was anywhere comparable as far as what they spent per day or what they spent per month
sw3048A-ms98-a-0058 249.560750 253.995250 in Nam versus what they spent here it's almost like we moved an entire
sw3048A-ms98-a-0059 253.995250 268.450000 organization the cities and all all the support team all the everything over there whereas in Nam it was kind of a little at a time but it was so protracted i- i guess the average cost of a month was probably less back in Nam than it was this time
sw3048A-ms98-a-0060 268.450000 270.264750 [silence]
sw3048A-ms98-a-0061 270.264750 271.998250 i don't what the
sw3048A-ms98-a-0062 271.998250 274.810875 [silence]
sw3048A-ms98-a-0063 274.810875 277.379500 cost of living adjusting yeah
sw3048A-ms98-a-0064 277.379500 281.968875 [silence]
sw3048A-ms98-a-0065 281.968875 283.004875 yeah
sw3048A-ms98-a-0066 283.004875 287.039000 i just didn't know how much support they gave them_1 uh they didn't have
sw3048A-ms98-a-0067 287.039000 288.145750 [silence]
sw3048A-ms98-a-0068 288.145750 294.991375 well like in this one they didn't have a whole lot of USO type stuff to have to [vocalized-noise] put up or build buildings for it was all temporary
sw3048A-ms98-a-0069 294.991375 301.694750 but uh there there were bases that had permanent installation as far as entertainment and services went
sw3048A-ms98-a-0070 301.694750 303.794875 so i guess that cost a bit
sw3048A-ms98-a-0071 303.794875 306.840750 [silence]
sw3048A-ms98-a-0072 306.840750 307.792000 yeah

sw3048A-ms98-a-0074 312.041875 313.059250 yeah
sw3048A-ms98-a-0075 313.059250 323.860000 [silence]
sw3048A-ms98-a-0076 323.860000 328.543250 yeah they certainly shouldn't continue to deal with them as far as monies go
sw3048A-ms98-a-0077 328.543250 333.853375 [silence]
sw3048A-ms98-a-0078 333.853375 336.913875 yeah there is already talks of you know
sw3048A-ms98-a-0079 336.913875 339.489375 dealing with them again it won't be long
sw3048A-ms98-a-0080 339.489375 340.659750 yeah i guess it's
sw3048A-ms98-a-0081 340.659750 351.952250 i don't know whether it's better to know what your enemy has or [laughter] or you know fight against something you know is there or not ha[ve]- let him have anything i think i would rather not let him have anything
sw3048A-ms98-a-0082 351.952250 353.141125 [silence]
sw3048A-ms98-a-0083 353.141125 355.401250 yeah certainly sell him lesser equipment
sw3048A-ms98-a-0084 355.401250 359.113250 [silence]
sw3048A-ms98-a-0085 359.113250 360.353625 yeah

sw3048A-ms98-a-0087 362.057875 363.402625 they do make a mess

sw3048A-ms98-a-0089 368.000875 369.201125 that's true

sw3048A-ms98-a-0091 373.058750 374.922875 i mean we certainly made a
sw3048A-ms98-a-0092 374.922875 382.073500 a mess out of the areas that we bombed in the latest war too bad they couldn't do that kind of concentration on uh in Nam
sw3048A-ms98-a-0093 382.073500 386.918625 they just were not allowed i mean it took years before they would even allow the bombing that is kind of
sw3048A-ms98-a-0094 386.918625 390.189250 political [laughter] i have no other words for it [laughter]
