sw3048B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 77.691125 [silence]
sw3048B-ms98-a-0002 77.691125 81.459500 i don't think so [laughter]
sw3048B-ms98-a-0003 81.459500 83.929750 [silence]
sw3048B-ms98-a-0004 83.929750 88.665500 well my father wa[s]- my father was in Nam my brother was in Nam
sw3048B-ms98-a-0005 88.665500 92.209125 yeah you know i had a lot of friends in Nam so
sw3048B-ms98-a-0006 92.209125 95.387875 it's like it hit it hit pretty close
sw3048B-ms98-a-0007 95.387875 97.257625 [silence]
sw3048B-ms98-a-0008 97.257625 101.842000 the reasons that they did it now and the reasons that they did it then are still the same
sw3048B-ms98-a-0009 101.842000 103.013000 there is
sw3048B-ms98-a-0010 103.013000 103.965000 it's
sw3048B-ms98-a-0011 103.965000 105.560125 it's yeah
sw3048B-ms98-a-0012 105.560125 108.846500 the only difference is is the people here
sw3048B-ms98-a-0013 108.846500 112.986250 the people now is going to back there but see they you can't take
sw3048B-ms98-a-0014 112.986250 118.097500 like they you know they they are acknowledging the Vietnam vets now we[ll]- but that's not going to work
sw3048B-ms98-a-0015 118.097500 123.574375 because they are they were already misused when they came back and they're not going to forget that
sw3048B-ms98-a-0016 123.574375 125.425750 so you know
sw3048B-ms98-a-0017 125.425750 131.510375 and i know my brother won't he spent a lot of time so he came back totally screwed up
sw3048B-ms98-a-0018 131.510375 140.010375 so you know i- i blame a lot on Uncle Sam because of the fact [vocalized-noise] you know they had it in your living room and
sw3048B-ms98-a-0019 140.010375 141.438625 stuff like that
sw3048B-ms98-a-0020 141.438625 143.749875 and i don't i didn't like that at all
sw3048B-ms98-a-0021 143.749875 145.513125 because_1 it makes you worry more
sw3048B-ms98-a-0022 145.513125 152.870250 [silence]
sw3048B-ms98-a-0023 152.870250 164.825375 in a way it is because then you don't have to really worry [vocalized-noise] that or if you see something and you you think it's your child or you think it's somebody you know and they are dead and then you know yo[u]- you done went haywire for nothing
sw3048B-ms98-a-0024 164.825375 165.953875 so
sw3048B-ms98-a-0025 165.953875 172.019625 it's just it's i think the war then was just as useless as it is now
sw3048B-ms98-a-0026 172.019625 173.096750 [silence]
sw3048B-ms98-a-0027 173.096750 174.355625 but you know
sw3048B-ms98-a-0028 174.355625 180.883375 should i it it's not really useless i guess really Saddam if they were going to do it i think they should have just kept going
sw3048B-ms98-a-0029 180.883375 181.940625 [silence]
sw3048B-ms98-a-0030 181.940625 185.531000 instead of half doing the job
sw3048B-ms98-a-0031 185.531000 188.594125 because the people still over there is in trouble
sw3048B-ms98-a-0032 188.594125 196.040000 [silence]
sw3048B-ms98-a-0033 196.040000 199.539500 instead of doing all this political stuff that's half the problem
sw3048B-ms98-a-0034 199.539500 205.755000 it's too much politic[al]- politics involved in a war you know they tell you you can't do this but you know what
sw3048B-ms98-a-0035 205.755000 209.582375 everybody else does not do like the United States people don't listen
sw3048B-ms98-a-0036 209.582375 213.596625 they say we could not do certain things to them but they could do everything to us
sw3048B-ms98-a-0037 213.596625 215.748125 you know and that's what makes it bad
sw3048B-ms98-a-0038 215.748125 218.448750 [silence]
sw3048B-ms98-a-0039 218.448750 225.119500 yeah but the[y]- but they did you know so you know it's like uh-huh sure right [laughter] whatever you say
sw3048B-ms98-a-0040 225.119500 227.674250 [silence]
sw3048B-ms98-a-0041 227.674250 231.409125 just like Storming Norman they should've let that man loose
sw3048B-ms98-a-0042 231.409125 238.365625 they should've just let him loose in the city [laughter-he] would have just cleaned house i think he would have done better
sw3048B-ms98-a-0043 238.365625 240.747000 [silence]
sw3048B-ms98-a-0044 240.747000 241.867875 so
sw3048B-ms98-a-0045 241.867875 256.169500 [silence]
sw3048B-ms98-a-0046 256.169500 257.859250 oh yeah
sw3048B-ms98-a-0047 257.859250 266.630500 [silence]
sw3048B-ms98-a-0048 266.630500 274.223375 yeah it was plus it was less but still if you take it back then and do the do the do the uh
sw3048B-ms98-a-0049 274.223375 282.474500 what do you call it the average the cost of living there and do it now and do the cost of living it still gonna cost you money it'll cost you about the same
sw3048B-ms98-a-0050 282.474500 283.743000 so
sw3048B-ms98-a-0051 283.743000 294.281125 [silence]
sw3048B-ms98-a-0052 294.281125 295.629375 um-hum
sw3048B-ms98-a-0053 295.629375 300.157000 [silence]
sw3048B-ms98-a-0054 300.157000 301.762000 um-hum
sw3048B-ms98-a-0055 301.762000 307.231500 and so you know see the ships people don't realize it but the ships and all that stuff that's still over there 
sw3048B-ms98-a-0056 307.231500 312.617625 and then you think about it Vietnam is how old and they still have prisoners of war
sw3048B-ms98-a-0057 312.617625 320.411625 see i don't think that is right i think the United States should but they put down and go over there and be and just go over there and go through it period you know 
sw3048B-ms98-a-0058 320.411625 326.445125 find out where they are some people know the government knows that's the bad part
sw3048B-ms98-a-0059 326.445125 328.134000 [silence]
sw3048B-ms98-a-0060 328.134000 334.160000 no but here we are you know Saddam wouldn't have been so bad if we had not gave him half the stuff he's got
sw3048B-ms98-a-0061 334.160000 337.690500 [silence]
sw3048B-ms98-a-0062 337.690500 339.370625 um-hum
sw3048B-ms98-a-0063 339.370625 342.267000 well he'll be back
sw3048B-ms98-a-0064 342.267000 350.252625 [silence]
sw3048B-ms98-a-0065 350.252625 353.402125 why give him the same advantage that you have
sw3048B-ms98-a-0066 353.402125 354.993625 okay
sw3048B-ms98-a-0067 354.993625 363.054375 yeah but nothing new but he had modern equipment scud launchers i mean let's get real here those are mobile missile launchers
sw3048B-ms98-a-0068 363.054375 366.899375 and then United States is not going to use them yeah right uh-huh
sw3048B-ms98-a-0069 366.899375 369.004500 [laughter]
sw3048B-ms98-a-0070 369.004500 372.840125 so you know it's like what do you want to do first
sw3048B-ms98-a-0071 372.840125 381.777125 [silence]
sw3048B-ms98-a-0072 381.777125 382.894250 um-hum
sw3048B-ms98-a-0073 382.894250 389.206750 [silence]
sw3048B-ms98-a-0074 389.206750 393.130375 nope there's nothing else that you can do about it it is just
sw3048B-ms98-a-0075 393.130375 396.712125 you know i think they should've done more
sw3048B-ms98-a-0076 396.712125 397.774250 [silence]
sw3048B-ms98-a-0077 397.774250 404.552375 than what they did over there and i still think they should've done more [vocalized-noise] what they did over in uh Saudi Arabia 
sw3048B-ms98-a-0078 404.552375 405.744500 [silence]
sw3048B-ms98-a-0079 405.744500 411.110750 because to me uh the United States went both these places and they made it worse for the people that's there
sw3048B-ms98-a-0080 411.110750 413.420750 [silence]
sw3048B-ms98-a-0081 413.420750 422.040500 so it depends on if you there you can see it if not then you will never know cause in the United States people never know what's going on
sw3048B-ms98-a-0082 422.040500 424.667250 they just take whatever they get told
sw3048B-ms98-a-0083 424.667250 425.752125 [silence]
sw3048B-ms98-a-0084 425.752125 426.823500 that's right
sw3048B-ms98-a-0085 426.823500 431.650500 [silence]
