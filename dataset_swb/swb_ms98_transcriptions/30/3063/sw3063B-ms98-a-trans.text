sw3063B-ms98-a-0050 195.996500 205.783250 [laughter] i think we've got to do more with the recycling that's i'm i'm really glad to see that there's more of that happening

sw3063B-ms98-a-0057 223.222000 228.171500 um-hum well it's going to it's probably going to be a generation or two before
sw3063B-ms98-a-0058 228.171500 232.902875 before it's really going very well because
sw3063B-ms98-a-0059 232.902875 240.114375 now the adults are more aware of it and the children are being taught in the schools more
sw3063B-ms98-a-0060 240.114375 246.645500 it'll be you know on down the road this is going to be passed on which is good
sw3063B-ms98-a-0061 246.645500 255.851375 [silence]
sw3063B-ms98-a-0062 255.851375 257.289625 um-hum

sw3063B-ms98-a-0068 282.308750 291.339250 i think you're right education is a big thing you know and as we educate them individually what they can do
sw3063B-ms98-a-0069 291.339250 306.016125 people become more aware of the things in industry too that that are causing problems and and i think that they'll grad[ually]- they'll work towards solving those problems more too
sw3063B-ms98-a-0070 306.016125 307.651750 um
sw3063B-ms98-a-0071 307.651750 313.810500 [silence]

sw3063B-ms98-a-0079 343.674125 348.451875 yeah well i think science has come a long way to making it
sw3063B-ms98-a-0080 348.451875 352.127750 so that it's possible to find ways to solve the problem
sw3063B-ms98-a-0081 352.127750 353.160500 [noise]
sw3063B-ms98-a-0082 353.160500 354.660250 um

sw3063B-ms98-a-0084 360.074875 363.090625 i think they teach it a lot in science
sw3063B-ms98-a-0085 363.090625 367.328500 yeah i would think that that's where it would come through
sw3063B-ms98-a-0086 367.328500 369.966000 [silence]
sw3063B-ms98-a-0087 369.966000 371.138625 i
sw3063B-ms98-a-0088 371.138625 375.242750 i think they're kind of getting it in all different grades

sw3063B-ms98-a-0090 380.959875 382.306750 yeah
sw3063B-ms98-a-0091 382.306750 389.458250 i think they are starting probably in the first grade they're you know they're hearing somewhat about it um
sw3063B-ms98-a-0092 389.458250 390.753875 [silence]
sw3063B-ms98-a-0093 390.753875 396.876625 i know uh Target has their program to make kids more aware of it and
sw3063B-ms98-a-0094 396.876625 398.068250 yeah
sw3063B-ms98-a-0095 398.068250 405.480000 they've got if you go in the entrance they've got uh stands usually where they have um
sw3063B-ms98-a-0096 405.480000 414.822250 little uh kind of a little newspaper thing that the kids can read and and they can form a a group to
sw3063B-ms98-a-0097 414.822250 417.925250 uh yeah yeah
sw3063B-ms98-a-0098 417.925250 419.526750 so

sw3063B-ms98-a-0102 431.701625 442.295125 well i- i know it's har[d]- it's a hard problem to solve because you you know like McDonald's has changed back and forth between paper and foam and that kind of thing and
sw3063B-ms98-a-0103 442.295125 449.741125 and they do all these studies on which ones pollute more and then there's the paper and plastic bag question
