sw3063A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 5.724250 uh we are to discuss air pollution and uh what we think the causes are
sw3063A-ms98-a-0002 5.724250 11.376125 and i probably would uh target uh industry as being number one polluter
sw3063A-ms98-a-0003 11.376125 28.423375 [silence]
sw3063A-ms98-a-0004 28.423375 32.103000 well vehicles and and yes and
sw3063A-ms98-a-0005 32.103000 40.371375 but right because uh there's a lot of commercial [laughter-vehicles] out there especially those the big rigs like the busses and um
sw3063A-ms98-a-0006 40.371375 43.812625 the big uh eighteen wheelers and so forth
sw3063A-ms98-a-0007 43.812625 44.823875 [silence]
sw3063A-ms98-a-0008 44.823875 52.813500 i think they would generate probably uh one of them would probably generate enough for three cars [laughter]
sw3063A-ms98-a-0009 52.813500 64.348500 but that's not and i think it can be resolved if uh if they really let go with the technology that they have at uh at their hand and they haven't released it yet
sw3063A-ms98-a-0010 64.348500 69.167250 i think there's a lot of hold back uh because of uh
sw3063A-ms98-a-0011 69.167250 76.174500 oh priorities that they have you know and um it's you have some children
sw3063A-ms98-a-0012 76.174500 78.496625 [laughter]
sw3063A-ms98-a-0013 78.496625 97.932750 [silence]
sw3063A-ms98-a-0014 97.932750 103.097375 oh okay [laughter] do you have do you watch children or do you
sw3063A-ms98-a-0015 103.097375 108.355250 [silence]
sw3063A-ms98-a-0016 108.355250 109.934000 uh-huh
sw3063A-ms98-a-0017 109.934000 111.805375 w[ell]- well that's interesting
sw3063A-ms98-a-0018 111.805375 113.356625 um
sw3063A-ms98-a-0019 113.356625 115.164375 is there anything
sw3063A-ms98-a-0020 115.164375 116.245250 [silence]
sw3063A-ms98-a-0021 116.245250 122.802125 [laughter] well temporarily they do [laughter] then we get out of that phase
sw3063A-ms98-a-0022 122.802125 124.397125 soon enough
sw3063A-ms98-a-0023 124.397125 125.805125 um
sw3063A-ms98-a-0024 125.805125 134.836625 [silence]
sw3063A-ms98-a-0025 134.836625 136.051125 oh yes
sw3063A-ms98-a-0026 136.051125 138.077375 [silence]
sw3063A-ms98-a-0027 138.077375 139.163375 um-hum
sw3063A-ms98-a-0028 139.163375 142.530500 [silence]
sw3063A-ms98-a-0029 142.530500 144.487625 uh-huh sure
sw3063A-ms98-a-0030 144.487625 150.380000 [silence]
sw3063A-ms98-a-0031 150.380000 164.599000 um-hum [noise] well i know uh uh in Michigan uh the way they used to take care of the trash is they would incinerate it and the fumes from the incineration was a terrible pollutant to the air
sw3063A-ms98-a-0032 164.599000 167.389000 and um of course now
sw3063A-ms98-a-0033 167.389000 169.180875 [silence]
sw3063A-ms98-a-0034 169.180875 175.268000 no and when they and you bury it and it's not gone either because it has untold ramifications
sw3063A-ms98-a-0035 175.268000 177.485625 and uh
sw3063A-ms98-a-0036 177.485625 178.927250 [silence]
sw3063A-ms98-a-0037 178.927250 186.426500 and it gets into into people you know which is uh the the most important um
sw3063A-ms98-a-0038 186.426500 191.723750 resource that we have is people and they're and they're destroying us they really are
sw3063A-ms98-a-0039 191.723750 196.711250 so i think the cockroach will evolve uh s[afely]- safely [laughter]
sw3063A-ms98-a-0040 196.711250 198.653500 so they say [laughter]
sw3063A-ms98-a-0041 198.653500 204.701375 [silence]
sw3063A-ms98-a-0042 204.701375 206.612125 yes but there's not enough
sw3063A-ms98-a-0043 206.612125 210.021250 and we need expert cooperation
sw3063A-ms98-a-0044 210.021250 213.340250 [silence]
sw3063A-ms98-a-0045 213.340250 215.878500 yeah education of the
sw3063A-ms98-a-0046 215.878500 219.771375 education of the people is primary i would think
sw3063A-ms98-a-0047 219.771375 223.836250 and uh and we're hard to teach
sw3063A-ms98-a-0048 223.836250 225.728375 we are hard to teach
sw3063A-ms98-a-0049 225.728375 227.214750 [silence]
sw3063A-ms98-a-0050 227.214750 229.010375 absolutely yeah
sw3063A-ms98-a-0051 229.010375 230.670000 [silence]
sw3063A-ms98-a-0052 230.670000 231.860125 um-hum
sw3063A-ms98-a-0053 231.860125 246.797250 [silence]
sw3063A-ms98-a-0054 246.797250 256.158125 absolutely yes uh of course uh we would like to see it accelerated because uh of the critical nature of it
sw3063A-ms98-a-0055 256.158125 268.634500 the the learning of it and the just to um think that way we have to be in that thought pattern and able to um motivate ourselves to um
sw3063A-ms98-a-0056 268.634500 272.854750 uh do what is right for the atmosphere
sw3063A-ms98-a-0057 272.854750 274.032750 [silence]
sw3063A-ms98-a-0058 274.032750 275.506250 um
sw3063A-ms98-a-0059 275.506250 282.277250 i think we're all contributors i mean every human being that lives is a contributor to pollution so
sw3063A-ms98-a-0060 282.277250 284.418750 we just um
sw3063A-ms98-a-0061 284.418750 285.999625 um-hum
sw3063A-ms98-a-0062 285.999625 308.632125 [silence]
sw3063A-ms98-a-0063 308.632125 314.818500 well hopefully it can be resolved within a shorter time frame than we have seen it done in the past
sw3063A-ms98-a-0064 314.818500 328.961250 that the time frame for cleaning up our air and our and our um [noise] land you know which uh we get our nutrients from you know i mean everything goes back to the land
sw3063A-ms98-a-0065 328.961250 333.207000 [silence]
sw3063A-ms98-a-0066 333.207000 344.346500 so [laughter] um it's just um very critical i think at this point to uh get that through to the people and get us educated
sw3063A-ms98-a-0067 344.346500 351.385875 [silence]
sw3063A-ms98-a-0068 351.385875 352.883250 um-hum
sw3063A-ms98-a-0069 352.883250 361.643250 i- i don't know if they offer classes in uh the uh in the grade school uh uh subjecting
sw3063A-ms98-a-0070 361.643250 362.867875 [silence]
sw3063A-ms98-a-0071 362.867875 365.434625 in science okay
sw3063A-ms98-a-0072 365.434625 369.517500 what grade level would that be would that be um
sw3063A-ms98-a-0073 369.517500 372.663500 perhaps the first grade level which would be
sw3063A-ms98-a-0074 372.663500 375.270250 [silence]
sw3063A-ms98-a-0075 375.270250 383.820625 well i mean are they starting though at at with the children that are so their little minds are like sponges and they can really uh relate to that
sw3063A-ms98-a-0076 383.820625 396.034000 [silence]
sw3063A-ms98-a-0077 396.034000 397.605000 target stores
sw3063A-ms98-a-0078 397.605000 399.024125 oh okay
sw3063A-ms98-a-0079 399.024125 409.075500 [silence]
sw3063A-ms98-a-0080 409.075500 410.678875 okay
sw3063A-ms98-a-0081 410.678875 412.501625 oh i see

sw3063A-ms98-a-0083 413.889500 414.500250 um
sw3063A-ms98-a-0084 414.500250 418.452875 help fight the pollution oh that's wonderful
sw3063A-ms98-a-0085 418.452875 428.086000 well i'm sure that uh perhaps they're the leaders you know and other will others will pick up on their example and carry it um [noise] further
sw3063A-ms98-a-0086 428.086000 430.433000 you know because um
sw3063A-ms98-a-0087 430.433000 431.606500 [silence]
sw3063A-ms98-a-0088 431.606500 433.653250 thoughts are
