sw3080B-ms98-a-0002 2.682500 14.436875 i do yes i uh uh i guess it actually changes i do a number of different things uh simply walking with my wife and uh sometimes my daughter will come along on her little bicycle
sw3080B-ms98-a-0003 14.436875 22.833750 uh and then moving up i run in the mornings not every morning it probably averages about two days a week
sw3080B-ms98-a-0004 22.833750 30.276500 and then with my wife i actually go to the gym and and lift weights which isn't i understand quite exercising but it's along the lines 
sw3080B-ms98-a-0005 30.276500 31.643375 how about yourself
sw3080B-ms98-a-0006 31.643375 38.223625 [silence]
sw3080B-ms98-a-0007 38.223625 39.564625 uh-huh
sw3080B-ms98-a-0008 39.564625 54.277750 [silence]
sw3080B-ms98-a-0009 54.277750 55.694125 uh-huh
sw3080B-ms98-a-0010 55.694125 61.106875 [silence]
sw3080B-ms98-a-0011 61.106875 62.371125 uh-huh
sw3080B-ms98-a-0012 62.371125 66.878625 [silence]
sw3080B-ms98-a-0013 66.878625 68.100125 right
sw3080B-ms98-a-0014 68.100125 73.639500 [silence]
sw3080B-ms98-a-0015 73.639500 75.129500 right
sw3080B-ms98-a-0016 75.129500 79.642375 [silence]
sw3080B-ms98-a-0017 79.642375 80.584875 that's right
sw3080B-ms98-a-0018 80.584875 84.721625 [silence]
sw3080B-ms98-a-0019 84.721625 88.654250 right so you look at it more as a as a task
sw3080B-ms98-a-0020 88.654250 90.336000 [silence]
sw3080B-ms98-a-0021 90.336000 91.761625 right
sw3080B-ms98-a-0022 91.761625 92.923500 i see
sw3080B-ms98-a-0023 92.923500 96.784750 [silence]
sw3080B-ms98-a-0024 96.784750 102.233000 right right so i'm thirty two years old which is probably different than yourself
sw3080B-ms98-a-0025 102.233000 114.017875 and so it's interesting that as you get older you begin to understand that you need to exercise in my job at Texas Instruments i have to sit in front of a computer all day and make phone calls so
sw3080B-ms98-a-0026 114.017875 125.526125 that i don't get any exercise doing that and plus there's a build up of stress so i need to go out and take those walks after dinner and i need to go out in the morning and run or i'll just get nuts
sw3080B-ms98-a-0027 125.526125 129.723500 so that's kind of a motivator so even though i can look at it as a task
sw3080B-ms98-a-0028 129.723500 142.814125 the you know i- i kind of get the uh i get some kind of global benefit from the from the whole thing by saying well i'm you know lowering my chance of heart attack and thus that type stuff
sw3080B-ms98-a-0029 142.814125 144.437375 [silence]
sw3080B-ms98-a-0030 144.437375 147.180875 sure that all i i do all that
sw3080B-ms98-a-0031 147.180875 150.156000 [silence]
sw3080B-ms98-a-0032 150.156000 151.464875 yeah
sw3080B-ms98-a-0033 151.464875 156.849125 [silence]
sw3080B-ms98-a-0034 156.849125 158.473000 right
sw3080B-ms98-a-0035 158.473000 172.166625 well it's a [vocalized-noise] something as simple as a walk with my wife is very enjoyable i do that at the end of the day and it takes you know that that during that time the stress from the day goes away i get to share whatever i did with my wife and and vice versa
sw3080B-ms98-a-0036 172.166625 183.328875 going to the gym is is actually something different than than the like oh and the running and i enjoy that too year i've been running since high school you know on track teams and the like so
sw3080B-ms98-a-0037 183.328875 191.266625 running i i'm at that point which you probably get to after about six months of dedicated running where you don't feel your muscles any more
sw3080B-ms98-a-0038 191.266625 205.789500 and you don't think about the pain of it you you you take the time to relax some how and you think about other things during those first few months you have to think about running and why your elbow hurts and why you can't breathe and this and that and that's no fun and it's so hard to get past that for a lot of people
sw3080B-ms98-a-0039 205.789500 207.145250 [silence]
sw3080B-ms98-a-0040 207.145250 213.956875 yeah the ex[ercise]- the uh weight lifting on the other hand is actually you know i think i look better
sw3080B-ms98-a-0041 213.956875 227.953875 i have just a ver[y]- i don't i'm not a huge person i'm just a regular looking guy but just going to lift weights on occasion with my wife and my wife thinks the same thing about both me and herself that get that little bit of definition in your muscles is is attractive
sw3080B-ms98-a-0042 227.953875 230.125250 so that pays also
sw3080B-ms98-a-0043 230.125250 243.223750 yeah so so i guess that aspect of that takes away the work the with my wife which is nice i love her you know i enjoy being with her i guess that's one thing but also uh that that long term benefit of a little bit of tone in your muscles
sw3080B-ms98-a-0044 243.223750 248.909625 [silence]
sw3080B-ms98-a-0045 248.909625 250.062125 yeah
sw3080B-ms98-a-0046 250.062125 253.819500 [silence]
sw3080B-ms98-a-0047 253.819500 255.083875 but
sw3080B-ms98-a-0048 255.083875 260.725875 [silence]
sw3080B-ms98-a-0049 260.725875 269.735875 oh yeah i don't i don't let that bother me but yeah that that's something that comes with time too you know i'll tell you the sit ups and push ups are excellent
sw3080B-ms98-a-0050 269.735875 274.155500 you know it's your own you you're you're struggling against your own body weight
sw3080B-ms98-a-0051 274.155500 284.250875 you can d[o]- have variety by putting your feet higher or lower by putting your arms further apart or closer together by doing them real quick or real slow and you can actually get a good wo[rk]- you can
sw3080B-ms98-a-0052 284.250875 291.042875 i know in the push up at least you can get chest muscles and the back of your arms quite built up just doing push ups
sw3080B-ms98-a-0053 291.042875 294.635750 [silence]
sw3080B-ms98-a-0054 294.635750 296.227375 oh is that right
sw3080B-ms98-a-0055 296.227375 297.235750 [silence]
sw3080B-ms98-a-0056 297.235750 298.533125 right
sw3080B-ms98-a-0057 298.533125 299.781250 yeah
sw3080B-ms98-a-0058 299.781250 300.821750 [silence]
sw3080B-ms98-a-0059 300.821750 302.299375 right
sw3080B-ms98-a-0060 302.299375 303.933875 [laughter]
sw3080B-ms98-a-0061 303.933875 305.674750 that's funny
sw3080B-ms98-a-0062 305.674750 307.069500 yeah
sw3080B-ms98-a-0063 307.069500 311.198375 [silence]
sw3080B-ms98-a-0064 311.198375 312.713500 yeah
sw3080B-ms98-a-0065 312.713500 321.414500 well may[be]- you know maybe not i'd say i'd say at twenty two you don't necessarily need a plan as long as you're getting getting the exercise otherwise
sw3080B-ms98-a-0066 321.414500 329.951750 when your life becomes sedentary is when you have to make yourself a plan and what's real funny about plans is that there's a struggle between
sw3080B-ms98-a-0067 329.951750 335.977250 uh when you when you add something to your life when you add a plan to your life something else has to go away [laughter]
sw3080B-ms98-a-0068 335.977250 347.184125 and that's the hard decision is okay if i'm going to run in the mornings what am i what do i trade it off for well the answer's sleep right if i'm going to walk at night what do i trade it off for well Star Trek
sw3080B-ms98-a-0069 347.184125 359.145875 or you know it it it's always trade-offs and you actually have to as you get older you have to really think what can go and what to to to to replace this thing it's i mean not just exercise but anything it's very hard
sw3080B-ms98-a-0070 359.145875 363.478125 and uh so i- i don't i don't think you should worry about not having a program yet 
sw3080B-ms98-a-0071 363.478125 364.618375 yep
sw3080B-ms98-a-0072 364.618375 365.557750 [noise]
sw3080B-ms98-a-0073 365.557750 372.290125 yeah i guess if you care or if your wife your future wife uh gives you a reason to care which helps
sw3080B-ms98-a-0074 372.290125 374.855375 [noise] well i think we covered it
