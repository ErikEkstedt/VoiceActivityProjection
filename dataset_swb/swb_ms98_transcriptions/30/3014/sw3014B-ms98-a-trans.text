sw3014B-ms98-a-0003 2.858500 6.532875 [vocalized-noise] have you recently bought a new car Catherine
sw3014B-ms98-a-0004 6.532875 11.770000 [silence]
sw3014B-ms98-a-0005 11.770000 13.282000 oh
sw3014B-ms98-a-0006 13.282000 15.482750 oh wow
sw3014B-ms98-a-0007 15.482750 20.732750 [silence]
sw3014B-ms98-a-0008 20.732750 32.651250 well i really i- the last car we got was a was a used car i really don't prefer buying a new car i like to let somebody else pay for [laughter-that] [laughter]
sw3014B-ms98-a-0009 32.651250 42.425625 but uh mine was a year old and we bought it for very functional purposes and that was we bought a station wagon we wanted an economical car
sw3014B-ms98-a-0010 42.425625 46.118625 to operate but we wanted one that could carry a lot of equipment
sw3014B-ms98-a-0011 46.118625 55.433875 [vocalized-noise] so we chose a Nissan Stanza wagon and i've never been sorry however the need for that
sw3014B-ms98-a-0012 55.433875 57.212000 kind of car
sw3014B-ms98-a-0013 57.212000 59.484000 has changed now
sw3014B-ms98-a-0014 59.484000 73.220000 and uh while it is still good and it's quite serviceable and i'll drive it until it no longer is reliable and probably then [laughter-some] [laughter] i spend a lot of time praying over it before i give it up
sw3014B-ms98-a-0015 73.220000 79.907375 i think that i would like to if i you know we all say if i could have the car i always wanted
sw3014B-ms98-a-0016 79.907375 83.853375 i would either buy a Nissan Maxima
sw3014B-ms98-a-0017 83.853375 89.812625 uh i'm sold on Nissans i o[r]- or or foreign cars actually uh
sw3014B-ms98-a-0018 89.812625 93.308000 [silence]
sw3014B-ms98-a-0019 93.308000 93.792875 [noise]
sw3014B-ms98-a-0020 93.792875 95.698625 uh
sw3014B-ms98-a-0021 95.698625 100.095000 [vocalized-noise] its reliability it's reliability
sw3014B-ms98-a-0022 100.095000 111.612250 and uh i you know i've read all the Consumer Reports and things and they just run head and shoulders above the American made cars if Ford was a head and the shoulders above it i'd buy a Ford
sw3014B-ms98-a-0023 111.612250 117.385625 but i had uh had a Ford Escort that absolutely needed taps the day we got it
sw3014B-ms98-a-0024 117.385625 126.495375 uh you know i mean it was ready for the graveyard and i spent as much on that car in twelve months as i spent for the car
sw3014B-ms98-a-0025 126.495375 136.119000 so and that was just trying to hold us getting out of that was a used car and it was an older car but you know Escort is supposed to have a great track record
sw3014B-ms98-a-0026 136.119000 138.667000 as far as sales
sw3014B-ms98-a-0027 138.667000 139.928875 but
sw3014B-ms98-a-0028 139.928875 149.678250 it's just it just was not [vocalized-noise] and you get stung a time or two and you say no thanks so i just trusted the Consumer Reports and the auto
sw3014B-ms98-a-0029 149.678250 162.078750 uh reports in[stead]- had my son who knows a lot about that study them thoroughly and he gave me four choices of cars to buy an Escort definitely was not among them in fact there wasn't an American car in there
sw3014B-ms98-a-0030 162.078750 163.586875 uh
sw3014B-ms98-a-0031 163.586875 171.156250 the Nissan came and and we bought the Nissan for functional purposes not what the Consumer Reports said we should get
sw3014B-ms98-a-0032 171.156250 183.309250 but it served our needs uh [vocalized-noise] later on his reports the reports that he studied showed that uh Nissan was head and shoulders above the rest in the ar[ea]- in the class that we were looking for 
sw3014B-ms98-a-0033 183.309250 186.570625 and that an[d]- i'd rather have a Maxima than a Cadillac
sw3014B-ms98-a-0034 186.570625 197.213625 i really would it's not necessarily prestige but it's comfort uh there's a lot of features on there that are desirable if you're going to pay that kind of money for a car uh
sw3014B-ms98-a-0035 197.213625 198.819875 [silence]
sw3014B-ms98-a-0036 198.819875 200.943500 Nissan M[axima]-

sw3014B-ms98-a-0040 215.937500 219.960000 then i'd buy me a fancy little red CRX sports car [laughter]
sw3014B-ms98-a-0041 219.960000 221.848625 [laughter]
sw3014B-ms98-a-0042 221.848625 225.872000 i mean you know every oth[er]- every one of us have two sides [laughter]

sw3014B-ms98-a-0056 251.590875 255.859625 i'll tell you that's sad too because at one time Ford was the best that was made
sw3014B-ms98-a-0057 255.859625 257.153250 really was
sw3014B-ms98-a-0058 257.153250 258.477625 and uh
sw3014B-ms98-a-0059 258.477625 267.685250 i i really have not seen now a lot of the American cars actually are are parts are produced in foreign countries and assembled here or vice versa
sw3014B-ms98-a-0060 267.685250 268.719000 [silence]
sw3014B-ms98-a-0061 268.719000 270.043500 of course
sw3014B-ms98-a-0062 270.043500 276.066875 [silence]
sw3014B-ms98-a-0063 276.066875 280.146750 okay huh uh
sw3014B-ms98-a-0064 280.146750 285.957250 [noise] at any rate do you have color preferences or what would be the features that you'd be looking for

sw3014B-ms98-a-0071 305.471125 308.403875 [silence]
sw3014B-ms98-a-0072 308.403875 313.502500 yeah oh wow [laughter-we] like the stuff that glitters
sw3014B-ms98-a-0073 313.502500 315.332750 [laughter]
sw3014B-ms98-a-0074 315.332750 325.451250 good there's nothing wrong with that actually i think probably if i were going to get uh if i were going to be practical which doesn't mean i would be i would prefer white
sw3014B-ms98-a-0075 325.451250 329.017375 because simply because it's more visible at night
sw3014B-ms98-a-0076 329.017375 336.098125 and uh-huh um-hum now the interior okay i don't care about the interior just as long as it's not black or red
sw3014B-ms98-a-0077 336.098125 337.381500 [laughter]
sw3014B-ms98-a-0078 337.381500 348.333625 but if i had the little read CRX i guess the interior would have to be black leather and i'd have to live with that and if i got the CRX it would have to have a real good sound system in it because i'd want that too
sw3014B-ms98-a-0079 348.333625 354.088250 i'd just go back to my teenage years and just throw all my experience to the wind [laughter]
sw3014B-ms98-a-0080 354.088250 355.832375 [silence]
sw3014B-ms98-a-0081 355.832375 357.105500 um-hum

sw3014B-ms98-a-0085 371.982875 373.878750 [silence]
sw3014B-ms98-a-0086 373.878750 375.396000 that's okay
sw3014B-ms98-a-0087 375.396000 381.455875 [silence]
sw3014B-ms98-a-0088 381.455875 386.648625 no no no i generally would p[refer]- uh prefer to listen to
sw3014B-ms98-a-0089 386.648625 393.342375 uh well i listen to KCBI a lot but i will listen to the news and the and the traffic and those things at work
sw3014B-ms98-a-0090 393.342375 407.005375 but if i'm going to be traveling in that car for any period of time i want some real good classical music i love classical music and you just can't enjoy it unless you've got a good sound system to produce all the
sw3014B-ms98-a-0091 407.005375 409.588125 all the characteristics of the instruments
sw3014B-ms98-a-0092 409.588125 416.316750 so i do love classical music or at lea[st]- or or uh contemporary classical
sw3014B-ms98-a-0093 416.316750 425.526750 uh-huh sure do WRR and the Oasis are the two that i listen to more than anything else and i do like them and
sw3014B-ms98-a-0094 425.526750 440.461125 i'd like to have a compact disk player in a car that would be something that i would really like those compact disks really are good for cars because they don't melt they don't warp you know [laughter-there's] [laughter-nothing] in there that can wrap around the the uh
sw3014B-ms98-a-0095 440.461125 444.872375 rollers or anything it see[ms]- seems like a really good answer
sw3014B-ms98-a-0096 444.872375 448.553250 to portable music that you can choose
sw3014B-ms98-a-0097 448.553250 449.728500 [noise]
