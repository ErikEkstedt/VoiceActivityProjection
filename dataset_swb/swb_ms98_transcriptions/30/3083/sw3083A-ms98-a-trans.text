sw3083A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 3.611125 okay what do you think is the biggest problem
sw3083A-ms98-a-0002 3.611125 9.362125 [silence]
sw3083A-ms98-a-0003 9.362125 10.536500 uh-huh
sw3083A-ms98-a-0004 10.536500 20.170000 [silence]
sw3083A-ms98-a-0005 20.170000 21.341875 uh-huh
sw3083A-ms98-a-0006 21.341875 25.027625 [silence]
sw3083A-ms98-a-0007 25.027625 25.891125 yeah
sw3083A-ms98-a-0008 25.891125 28.814750 [silence]
sw3083A-ms98-a-0009 28.814750 34.185625 is it the do you think it's the values that they're teaching in school or the the values they get from home
sw3083A-ms98-a-0010 34.185625 62.842125 [silence]
sw3083A-ms98-a-0011 62.842125 64.360375 right
sw3083A-ms98-a-0012 64.360375 65.543625 [silence]
sw3083A-ms98-a-0013 65.543625 75.585250 yeah i- i- i- i think that the biggest problem is uh with the uh with the the home environment being part of it you know if
sw3083A-ms98-a-0014 75.585250 87.395125 i think too many parents expect uh the the school to teach uh the moral aspects of of things to the st[udents]- to the kids and you know while we're not going to worry about uh
sw3083A-ms98-a-0015 87.395125 93.965875 teaching you manners or teaching you respect for anyone or anything like that you know and then uh
sw3083A-ms98-a-0016 93.965875 105.439000 expect them to to pick it up at school and you're not going to do that you know you're going to carry carry with carry to school uh out into the world you know what you learned at home and uh
sw3083A-ms98-a-0017 105.439000 108.782750 uh i think that that part of that's
sw3083A-ms98-a-0018 108.782750 112.373500 showing up now you know with with things because_1 kids
sw3083A-ms98-a-0019 112.373500 121.048625 i think have probably less respect than for for people than in in other things than
sw3083A-ms98-a-0020 121.048625 124.492000 than uh we may have seen in the past uh
sw3083A-ms98-a-0021 124.492000 129.869875 and uh part of it's the the family i think and part of it's uh
sw3083A-ms98-a-0022 129.869875 139.776250 the living conditions of certain people are are subjected too uh drugs is a big problem now and i think that's that's that's another root problem
sw3083A-ms98-a-0023 139.776250 160.211875 [silence]
sw3083A-ms98-a-0024 160.211875 161.893750 uh-huh
sw3083A-ms98-a-0025 161.893750 183.804250 [silence]
sw3083A-ms98-a-0026 183.804250 186.414750 right right
sw3083A-ms98-a-0027 186.414750 194.410500 [silence]
sw3083A-ms98-a-0028 194.410500 204.016375 well i think it's like you say it's it's the socioeconomic mix there you know the they're uh the y[ou]- you look at the if the if the
sw3083A-ms98-a-0029 204.016375 212.633500 the uh schools like that that where you got a lot of kids who are basically uh
sw3083A-ms98-a-0030 212.633500 224.649625 that might be more well to well off you know going to a private Catholic school or whatever uh and and they're not all that way but you know some that are um
sw3083A-ms98-a-0031 224.649625 233.985500 that they're they're they're not quite the same as as the kids that are going to the inner city uh you know public schools
sw3083A-ms98-a-0032 233.985500 244.447750 [silence]
sw3083A-ms98-a-0033 244.447750 245.623250 yeah
sw3083A-ms98-a-0034 245.623250 264.161750 [silence]
sw3083A-ms98-a-0035 264.161750 276.406875 well you know in a lot of cases uh like that where you know if kids are going to a public parochial school like that it's it's because_1 the parents are more interested in them receiving them
sw3083A-ms98-a-0036 276.406875 286.864750 uh uh an education it shows i think it shows that the parents have some uh desire for for the kid to do do well you know and that may be
sw3083A-ms98-a-0037 286.864750 293.602875 now passed on down to to the kid as well and uh maybe they pick up on that
sw3083A-ms98-a-0038 293.602875 303.660375 then and then from the other aspect um maybe the uh the school itself is is has more emphasis on uh
sw3083A-ms98-a-0039 303.660375 314.839875 trying to do a good job because the classes may be smaller uh they may be able to to give the resources that's needed to uh to do a good job
sw3083A-ms98-a-0040 314.839875 320.489875 [laughter]
sw3083A-ms98-a-0041 320.489875 329.989000 uh that's a tough question how to fix the school system uh with uh i would try to
sw3083A-ms98-a-0042 329.989000 344.439375 i guess uh to see about getting parents more involved [vocalized-noise] try to to come up with more ways to do that uh uh uh stress the importance of education to both both the parents and the students and
sw3083A-ms98-a-0043 344.439375 346.822375 uh
sw3083A-ms98-a-0044 346.822375 348.137125 more
sw3083A-ms98-a-0045 348.137125 361.479750 more classes that i think that are and i think this is is happening some around the country in terms of um morals trying to teach the kinds of things that that aren't getting taught at home and
sw3083A-ms98-a-0046 361.479750 363.055500 uh
sw3083A-ms98-a-0047 363.055500 365.554250 and and respect for other people
sw3083A-ms98-a-0048 365.554250 371.959375 uh i think that's a big part of it you know people you know if you don't care about property and people you know
sw3083A-ms98-a-0049 371.959375 374.690000 you're not going to care about uh
sw3083A-ms98-a-0050 374.690000 376.705125 about learning i think
sw3083A-ms98-a-0051 376.705125 379.580250 you know you're not going to really care about yourself
sw3083A-ms98-a-0052 379.580250 389.498000 [silence]
sw3083A-ms98-a-0053 389.498000 391.025125 right
sw3083A-ms98-a-0054 391.025125 409.630000 uh-huh 
sw3083A-ms98-a-0055 409.630000 418.409500 well you know and i that's not an ea[sy]- but that's not an easy task you know that's why i say it's it's a tough question what would you do because you know even
sw3083A-ms98-a-0056 418.409500 431.355125 trying to instill those values is kind of hard when uh when when you're growing up in you know in a home which may be uh just the pits and uh
sw3083A-ms98-a-0057 431.355125 442.548625 you kn[ow]- you don't have any any kind of a en[vironment]- good environment to live in you know it's kind of hard to say well you need to take care of of other people's stuff as well when you're when you
sw3083A-ms98-a-0058 442.548625 449.879500 you barely have anything yourself so i could see where that would be a problem and i think that's i think it's there are oth[ers]-
