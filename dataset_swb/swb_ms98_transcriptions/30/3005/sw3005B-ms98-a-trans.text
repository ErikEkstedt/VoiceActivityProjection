sw3005B-ms98-a-0011 69.521250 80.865625 in order to bring in money for their district they've got to vote to spend it in other districts and and uh the heck with the overall uh deficit and i[t]-
sw3005B-ms98-a-0012 80.865625 86.535875 districts is geographical but it can just as well be interest groups in terms of of uh
sw3005B-ms98-a-0013 86.535875 99.750625 whether it's Social Security or or anything that that uh it's it's what what you get for your constituents one way or another not what what's necessarily good overall
