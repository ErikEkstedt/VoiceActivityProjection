sw3005A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 5.364250 [noise] okay uh could you give me your thoughts on uh on any trends
sw3005A-ms98-a-0002 5.364250 40.019750 [silence]
sw3005A-ms98-a-0003 40.019750 50.796625 yeah um you're talking about the uh political action committees and uh [noise]
sw3005A-ms98-a-0004 50.796625 63.256875 [silence]
sw3005A-ms98-a-0005 63.256875 66.715125 right
sw3005A-ms98-a-0006 66.715125 73.753500 [silence]
sw3005A-ms98-a-0007 73.753500 75.587125 yeah
sw3005A-ms98-a-0008 75.587125 98.666250 [silence]
sw3005A-ms98-a-0009 98.666250 108.819875 yeah we're uh [vocalized-noise] we feel it up here in New England because we're small states so we don't have the represent and representatives that
sw3005A-ms98-a-0010 108.819875 123.732875 that the larger states have you know like like Texas and California um but we've got we have political clout only because of the tenure of the people that are in there like for uh uh the sub
sw3005A-ms98-a-0011 123.732875 127.969625 building you know Gratin and they're building down in Newport now
sw3005A-ms98-a-0012 127.969625 135.793625 but once uh somebody's got to do it somebody's got to build the subs and i guess Virginia can do it also in fact i've got a a
sw3005A-ms98-a-0013 135.793625 148.110125 the latest contract that was awarded Virginia sued or has got a lawsuit against uh Gratin to stop construction because it was unfairly obtained or something [laughter-like] [laughter-that] [laughter-you] [laughter-know]
sw3005A-ms98-a-0014 148.110125 156.745500 [silence]
sw3005A-ms98-a-0015 156.745500 157.952625 right
sw3005A-ms98-a-0016 157.952625 159.497750 this um
sw3005A-ms98-a-0017 159.497750 161.510375 Powell yep yep
sw3005A-ms98-a-0018 161.510375 162.532000 [silence]
sw3005A-ms98-a-0019 162.532000 163.547875 yep
sw3005A-ms98-a-0020 163.547875 175.995500 but when those when those people leave uh the power's going to go um there isn't really anything here because we're not really big enough so the economy is going to going to suffer i think because the the
sw3005A-ms98-a-0021 175.995500 190.070500 the base that New England always had the textile base the uh the uh costume jewelry base most of that now has moved out here to o[verseas]- to overseas or down south so we're prone to
sw3005A-ms98-a-0022 190.070500 203.313500 um uh recessions like the rest of the country were before we were kind of stable uh the political power is the only thing that can stabilize it at least i think up up this neck of the woods
sw3005A-ms98-a-0023 203.313500 215.137750 but there's too many now uh political action committees and where the money is coming from is coming from those states that have the big industries that can afford to contribute to those
sw3005A-ms98-a-0024 215.137750 229.921000 so those are going to get uh uh the squeaky wheel gets the oil they're going to they're going to catch it and somebody has to do it somebody has to do the work like Boeing or General Dynamics or wh[erever]- wherever they happen to be you know you've you've you've only got a few plane factories or
sw3005A-ms98-a-0025 229.921000 236.066250 [silence]
sw3005A-ms98-a-0026 236.066250 241.882875 well i i think they should be outlawed myself the the the packs i don't think they should be
sw3005A-ms98-a-0027 241.882875 248.957375 [silence]
sw3005A-ms98-a-0028 248.957375 250.691000 true
sw3005A-ms98-a-0029 250.691000 268.301625 [silence]
sw3005A-ms98-a-0030 268.301625 271.048125 oh like the yeah
sw3005A-ms98-a-0031 271.048125 276.641625 [silence]
sw3005A-ms98-a-0032 276.641625 278.949250 yep yep
sw3005A-ms98-a-0033 278.949250 288.512000 [silence]
sw3005A-ms98-a-0034 288.512000 290.990125 right yep
sw3005A-ms98-a-0035 290.990125 293.955375 [silence]
sw3005A-ms98-a-0036 293.955375 295.025875 yeah
sw3005A-ms98-a-0037 295.025875 298.834875 look at look at the tanks now look at that New Abrams tank
sw3005A-ms98-a-0038 298.834875 302.708625 and i have no idea what the cost is uh five million ten million
sw3005A-ms98-a-0039 302.708625 310.678000 for each one now you can make you can make a a missile or or a hand held rocket that can take one of those out pretty effectively
sw3005A-ms98-a-0040 310.678000 313.480250 w[hat]- what do we need all the tanks for
sw3005A-ms98-a-0041 313.480250 319.026000 i mean you can make you ma[ke]- you can make probably a thousand rockets for each tank
sw3005A-ms98-a-0042 319.026000 326.586750 and you can give a thousand rockets of a relatively unin[volved]- unin[volved]- untrained uh person and he can take he can take one of those tanks out
sw3005A-ms98-a-0043 326.586750 332.545125 but yet i'm not sure who is it Chrysler that makes the tanks or one of one of the
sw3005A-ms98-a-0044 332.545125 333.886750 [silence]
sw3005A-ms98-a-0045 333.886750 343.970000 and i don't think we really need all that hardware and a[gain]- and again like the Stealth bombers and and some of these things they they put on their drawing boards and they never fly or they never they never run right
sw3005A-ms98-a-0046 343.970000 348.105250 um is it because of of political clout
sw3005A-ms98-a-0047 348.105250 351.730000 rather than need i think in a lot of cases yes
sw3005A-ms98-a-0048 351.730000 357.296000 but we don't have a watchdog agency to the military overlooks their own testing
sw3005A-ms98-a-0049 357.296000 365.789000 which is good for us i mean it creates you know we generate a lot of income at TI because of the military contacts
sw3005A-ms98-a-0050 365.789000 370.577250 [silence]
sw3005A-ms98-a-0051 370.577250 376.929125 um the savings and loans crisis
sw3005A-ms98-a-0052 376.929125 386.279125 the political trends there are are m[ost]- most of these people are lawyers that are now in in uh
sw3005A-ms98-a-0053 386.279125 396.786625 the government whether it's state or local most of them_1 i guess you've been reading about the problems we've had in Rhode Island where the governor closed down a lot of the the uh credit unions and banks
sw3005A-ms98-a-0054 396.786625 402.970000 because of uh it was privately insured but but stated
sw3005A-ms98-a-0055 402.970000 406.192750 [silence]
sw3005A-ms98-a-0056 406.192750 410.845250 yeah there's still a lot of people that uh still can't get their money out
sw3005A-ms98-a-0057 410.845250 421.681250 um they still have to pay their their bills like their mortgages and things they slip them_1 under the door to the bank and but yet they can't get any of their savings
sw3005A-ms98-a-0058 421.681250 435.693250 so it's it's it's a little bit difficult but most of the people there the trend was that on almost every single board of the institutions that were closed they were state legislators
sw3005A-ms98-a-0059 435.693250 448.187875 so they had a conflict of interest because they tried to get through uh a bill stating that they had to have federal insurance rather than private insurance and it was squashed
sw3005A-ms98-a-0060 448.187875 449.722000 [silence]
