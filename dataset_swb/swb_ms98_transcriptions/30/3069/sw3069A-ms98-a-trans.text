sw3069A-ms98-a-0035 103.946125 115.929875 and so that makes real sense that that's um when it was written um i haven't wasn't really aware that she had written anything for um adults i was always just more aware of her jour[nal]- you know for her young people her books 
sw3069A-ms98-a-0036 115.929875 118.083000 um-hum

sw3069A-ms98-a-0050 144.715000 158.472250 yeah well it's i'm trying to think the last actual book i read that wasn't let's see i think i read oh when i was on vacation um between semester break and summer and you know on semester break between spring and summer
sw3069A-ms98-a-0051 158.472250 170.391625 and i went to my mother's i read a book that i have should have read when i was probably in high school i read um Jane Eyre [laughter] no wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute Jane Eyre no no no no it wasn't Jane Eyre no it was um
sw3069A-ms98-a-0052 170.391625 182.685500 [noise] uh Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen that's what it was yes and um you know i- i didn't know what to expect except i had heard that that Jane Austen was such a wonderful novelist and
sw3069A-ms98-a-0053 182.685500 190.538000 she really was good i mean i was was very much impressed with the way her plot was put together so intricately and um
sw3069A-ms98-a-0054 190.538000 197.831875 and you know i just but i as i say i was pretty much ashamed that i hadn't [laughter-read] something before then [laughter]
sw3069A-ms98-a-0055 197.831875 200.159500 um-hum
sw3069A-ms98-a-0056 200.159500 202.268375 yeah yeah

sw3069A-ms98-a-0060 210.488875 213.026625 oh how interesting
sw3069A-ms98-a-0061 213.026625 214.983375 yes
sw3069A-ms98-a-0062 214.983375 216.365250 [silence]
sw3069A-ms98-a-0063 216.365250 218.921625 oh i'll bet yeah
sw3069A-ms98-a-0064 218.921625 220.399875 yeah
sw3069A-ms98-a-0065 220.399875 221.691000 [silence]
sw3069A-ms98-a-0066 221.691000 224.568500 right i wouldn't be surprised yeah
sw3069A-ms98-a-0067 224.568500 232.989500 sure oh yeah well i read that and then i'm trying to think um usually i try to to find something long that i'm going to d[o]-
sw3069A-ms98-a-0068 232.989500 239.567375 when if if i have long periods of time like Christmas vacation or you know when i know i'm not going to be doing anything for a while um
sw3069A-ms98-a-0069 239.567375 250.536625 yeah and that's about it because_1 otherwise i'm reading so much for school i'm um i have just started reading a book actually it's for school but it's for um there's a a literary jour[nal]- well not a literary journal it's a
sw3069A-ms98-a-0070 250.536625 262.034750 it's kind of a journal of of the history of ideas that's that's starting to be published um from UTD the first issue doesn't come out until next year but um i'm doing some reviews of books just to
sw3069A-ms98-a-0071 262.034750 272.565750 what to sort of recommend to [vocalized-noise] well whether not a full-scale review should be done for the journal and i've yeah it's really neat because_1 these are brand new books and i just got a i got a th[is]- this one
sw3069A-ms98-a-0072 272.565750 284.120000 [vocalized-noise] um most of the stuff is on uh literary criticism and philosophy and religion and all that this one is on Johann Sebastian Bach and it's a a b[iography]- a biography
sw3069A-ms98-a-0073 284.120000 294.070625 that is really interesting i mean it it's fascinating it really is um but it's so long i- i don't really have the time to read the whole thing but i think eventually i'll go back to it but it
sw3069A-ms98-a-0074 294.070625 303.519500 it was written i mean the the copyright is nineteen ninety one so it's a brand new book yeah uh-huh yeah and he really this man really shed some light on um
sw3069A-ms98-a-0075 303.519500 312.729375 [noise] some aspects of of Bach's genius and and and you know the and more sociological things you know like the the idea that um
sw3069A-ms98-a-0076 312.729375 326.324625 that music to be a musician was as much um of a family occupation as anything i mean you know that was it was families had just loads of musicians [laughter] yeah that's right
sw3069A-ms98-a-0077 326.324625 327.558000 [silence]
sw3069A-ms98-a-0078 327.558000 330.957750 yes uh-huh and um
sw3069A-ms98-a-0079 330.957750 334.521125 y[eah]- yeah so um it was just really interesting if that's
sw3069A-ms98-a-0080 334.521125 349.202250 you know that's kind of what but i have to not only am am i rea[ding]- reading it to decide whether or not it should be reviewed but also um because the board of advisors for this um journal doesn't have right now doesn't have a really respected name um who's a
sw3069A-ms98-a-0081 349.202250 358.783750 um a scholar on on music um and [vocalized-noise] i'm supposed to decide whether i think this man might be a worthy person to be a you know in that position on the board so
sw3069A-ms98-a-0082 358.783750 366.112750 i don't know if i want to take that responsibility or not but [laughter] but at least i can tell them what i think so um it's real interesting
sw3069A-ms98-a-0083 366.112750 368.043500 yeah it is
sw3069A-ms98-a-0084 368.043500 371.978750 [silence]
sw3069A-ms98-a-0085 371.978750 373.875750 uh-huh
sw3069A-ms98-a-0086 373.875750 375.998125 yeah yeah
sw3069A-ms98-a-0087 375.998125 378.125500 yes
sw3069A-ms98-a-0088 378.125500 389.754750 yeah that it you know you see you see a lot of small colleges doing things like that right uh-huh because_1 it attracts really a a lot people's interest that's one way it's really good public relations for small schools i think so
sw3069A-ms98-a-0089 389.754750 402.394500 but uh another one of my projects this summer is actually it's part of my research assistantship is um it's helping a professor uh compile a bunch of translations of of various poems for a book that he's writing
sw3069A-ms98-a-0090 402.394500 410.189125 and so i'm learning the names if not the actual contents of a lot of different poems and a lot of French people
sw3069A-ms98-a-0091 410.189125 422.368625 um well where where for instance um a Baudelaire poem that was written in the French and then has been translated into English by various people and the translations are all so different from one another um-hum
sw3069A-ms98-a-0092 422.368625 432.083375 so it's multiple translations of single works and and that's right now right now pretty much what i'm doing as far as um my work is just kind of compiling all that for him so
sw3069A-ms98-a-0093 432.083375 434.168625 it's real interesting
sw3069A-ms98-a-0094 434.168625 438.716500 [laughter]
sw3069A-ms98-a-0095 438.716500 449.778750 oh well let me tell you there are days when i would be prefer be r[eally]- really doing that [laughter] i don't know if i've told you but um this is not on the subject
