sw3055B-ms98-a-0063 328.300500 339.274500 [vocalized-noise] well it's like the liquid is like a half of cup of water and then your egg and then your uh tablespoon of vinegar and you mix that together and then you you know your see it makes 
sw3055B-ms98-a-0064 339.274500 345.432250 it makes uh five pie crusts at once so that's it's quite a volume of [noise] um 
sw3055B-ms98-a-0065 345.432250 357.142500 i think it's four cups of flour and like uh a tablespoon of salt and a tablespoon of sugar and and you combine your dry ingredients and then you uh put in your liquid
sw3055B-ms98-a-0066 357.142500 360.241000 [silence]
sw3055B-ms98-a-0067 360.241000 371.482625 it just it just makes it very pliable and very flaky and you can really treat it rough and you're still going to have a flaky pie crust 
sw3055B-ms98-a-0068 371.482625 378.269500 like uh it's not mine it was from uh one of the magazines probably
sw3055B-ms98-a-0069 378.269500 388.973750 twenty years ago and it said you can throw this on the floor and step on it and it will still be flaky and i thought wow that's quite a statement for them to make
