sw3055A-ms98-a-0019 81.065500 90.745000 [noise] a an auction one time at the church [noise] excuse me and uh one of her pies was auctioned for fifty dollars [laughter] [noise] 
sw3055A-ms98-a-0020 90.745000 97.897250 well i- i think i- i- i've had it once and it's been a few years ago but i do recall that it was quite good so um
sw3055A-ms98-a-0021 97.897250 109.245750 yeah so that is her specialty um i like to bake um also i don't bake so much now that my children are grown but i do enjoy baking and i guess i always liked mak[ing]- making um
sw3055A-ms98-a-0022 109.245750 123.458875 cookies and bars and things like that that was more my specialty i suppose and they seem to last longer than pies around here [laughter-pies] [laughter-just] [laughter-would] would go practically in a day's [laughter-time] [laughter] yes 
sw3055A-ms98-a-0023 123.458875 126.565375 [silence]
sw3055A-ms98-a-0024 126.565375 133.706750 right [laughter] and not very happy huh [laughter]
sw3055A-ms98-a-0025 133.706750 141.388375 well it's interesting that uh yesterday i had lunch with a friend and she was telling me that she had a dinner party over the weekend for friends of hers for um a
sw3055A-ms98-a-0026 141.388375 155.999375 one of her acquaintances one of her old friends i guess had been in town and uh they invited two other couples over and so there were seven of them but uh i said well what did you have and she said what she had uh just Mexican food but you know she had uh uh you know guacamole and
sw3055A-ms98-a-0027 155.999375 163.764375 uh i can't remember all she had but she also had made uh flan which is actually Spanish i think have you ever made that or had it
sw3055A-ms98-a-0028 163.764375 166.489500 it's it it it's um
sw3055A-ms98-a-0029 166.489500 179.280500 i had used to work with a a gentleman who was from Cuba who would make it uh and it's just a wonderful dessert it's like uh [vocalized-noise] a egg custard in a uh caramelized sugar uh was on top of it and it's it's quite 
sw3055A-ms98-a-0030 179.280500 186.277000 actually not very difficult to make but it's very very high in cholesterol i'm sure with all the eggs that are in it but uh
sw3055A-ms98-a-0031 186.277000 195.321875 she said that she and her husband had uh traveled in Spain a couple of years ago and and flan is almost uh a basic with every meal that you get there
sw3055A-ms98-a-0032 195.321875 207.325875 yeah uh-huh it's just very customary to get flan so if you ever run into that [laughter-you'll] you'll sort of be aware of what that's all about but uh i would never have thought of making that as part of a a Mexican dinner but
sw3055A-ms98-a-0033 207.325875 220.840625 you know so papillas i guess would be another kind of a dessert if you decided to do something like that but [noise] flan is something you can make ahead and have just uh you know have ready but uh oh i would have been thinking i would like to have a dinner party sometime soon but
sw3055A-ms98-a-0034 220.840625 235.484250 i tell you it that i my it's one of those things where it does require some real uh planning and it's you know you don't just make the dinner you have your house to clean and you know the the whole business that goes with that
sw3055A-ms98-a-0035 235.484250 243.472875 yeah probably good way to do it [laughter] oh the house needs cleaning i guess i better have a dinner party yeah [laughter]
