sw3035A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 11.537625 uh our children are both uh basically adults they we've we've got two uh one's twenty one and one's twenty five and they they still live at home
sw3035A-ms98-a-0002 11.537625 21.548625 well that's that's a little unusual for uh for children of that age to have both of them_1 that age at home but uh i guess the activities that uh we have with them are 
sw3035A-ms98-a-0003 21.548625 28.715625 uh [noise] pretty few and far between actually the they're both going on their own most of the time
sw3035A-ms98-a-0004 28.715625 36.806625 so uh most of our activities are you know just discussion type things about what's going on in the family and what they're doing and
sw3035A-ms98-a-0005 36.806625 38.532750 that kind of thing
sw3035A-ms98-a-0006 38.532750 40.803000 [silence]
sw3035A-ms98-a-0007 40.803000 42.567375 uh-huh
sw3035A-ms98-a-0008 42.567375 44.177000 [silence]
sw3035A-ms98-a-0009 44.177000 45.656500 sure it does
sw3035A-ms98-a-0010 45.656500 67.996125 [silence]
sw3035A-ms98-a-0011 67.996125 70.806750 uh-huh oh yeah i
sw3035A-ms98-a-0012 70.806750 75.916250 [silence]
sw3035A-ms98-a-0013 75.916250 77.265500 yeah
sw3035A-ms98-a-0014 77.265500 81.364250 [silence]
sw3035A-ms98-a-0015 81.364250 84.587000 yeah is the one year old a boy a girl
sw3035A-ms98-a-0016 84.587000 92.007500 [vocalized-noise] ours is the older one's a girl so and the and the younger one's a boy so um
sw3035A-ms98-a-0017 92.007500 104.030500 i guess uh what i see is so far as uh the trends uh uh for children uh i don't know what kind of a area Virginia Beach is but course uh Richardson's in the Dallas area 
sw3035A-ms98-a-0018 104.030500 110.876500 and uh i think uh the big city uh activities for for children now
sw3035A-ms98-a-0019 110.876500 122.351625 are they're good but there's so much uh potential danger you know that you really have to watch your children so closely now that y[ou]- you can't let them_1 grow up the way
sw3035A-ms98-a-0020 122.351625 128.027875 the way i grew up you know that i i'm from a smaller town in East Texas [noise] and 
sw3035A-ms98-a-0021 128.027875 138.173750 i could you know go and do whatever pretty much whatever i wanted to do uh my whole life uh you know i never never had to worry about the bad guys being out there
sw3035A-ms98-a-0022 138.173750 148.753750 and uh you know i find that it's quite a bit different now that uh you know you have to watch your children so closely and uh keep up with them_1 i- i feel like uh that it's 
sw3035A-ms98-a-0023 148.753750 158.902625 it's really a sad commentary on uh you know on life in general that uh you know that children can't cannot be allowed to grow up uh you know without 
sw3035A-ms98-a-0024 158.902625 169.603625 really close supervision 
sw3035A-ms98-a-0025 169.603625 170.900375 um-hum

sw3035A-ms98-a-0033 218.066500 227.336375 yeah [noise] um i guess [vocalized-noise] looking at uh back at at what our children did compared to what uh you know what i had to go through in school [noise]
sw3035A-ms98-a-0034 227.336375 236.662250 the uh there i[s]- there does seem to be a lot more [noise] in the curriculum it's a lot more complicated a lot more available of course
sw3035A-ms98-a-0035 236.662250 249.628875 but uh there s[eems]- seem to be a so much more to learn now that it it really makes it more difficult i would think i w[ould]- i would probably have a hard time getting through school myself uh you know i just or at least it'd be a lot harder than it was when i went to school
sw3035A-ms98-a-0036 249.628875 254.928375 [silence]

sw3035A-ms98-a-0050 304.708375 315.686875 yeah that uh uh watching the little little boys play soccer is uh is more fun [laughter] i can't imagine that them having as much fun as the parents had watching them_1 [laughter]
sw3035A-ms98-a-0051 315.686875 320.039750 [silence]
sw3035A-ms98-a-0052 320.039750 325.829875 right yeah [vocalized-noise] di[sorganized]- d[isorganized]- disorganized play that's uh r[eally]- really what it was but
sw3035A-ms98-a-0053 325.829875 337.613125 but uh yeah when ours was a he i guess he was probably five or six you know when he first started playing soccer and uh and it was it was more fun to watch those boys trying t[o]- trying to kick the ball up and down the field
sw3035A-ms98-a-0054 337.613125 347.508750 but uh and it i guess that was uh you know it was important uh [noise] as much important to the parents as it was to the children that uh you know to get out and watch the kids play so
sw3035A-ms98-a-0055 347.508750 354.948875 i guess one of the things that i think about is a y[ou]- talking about education uh i kind of feel like uh
sw3035A-ms98-a-0056 354.948875 365.821250 that uh the the school systems in uh particularly in this area the systems are not under enough control the the students
sw3035A-ms98-a-0057 365.821250 372.574500 have a little too much uh too much leeway [noise] excuse me
sw3035A-ms98-a-0058 372.574500 374.043000 um
sw3035A-ms98-a-0059 374.043000 380.137625 a[nd]- an[d]- an[d]- and that's kind of contradictory to what i said but you know y[ou]- th[e]- ha[ve]- you have to be under control
sw3035A-ms98-a-0060 380.137625 386.540000 so much when they're out but when they're in school they they don't have quite quite as much control over them_1 as uh
sw3035A-ms98-a-0061 386.540000 394.184875 as what i would like to have seen uh uh uh i kind of feel like there's there's too much allowed to go on in at at school 
sw3035A-ms98-a-0062 394.184875 396.747125 [noise] and uh you know it tends to uh
sw3035A-ms98-a-0063 396.747125 409.720625 to encourage students to not be as [vocalized-noise] you know to not concentrate as much on education you know they're they're there for a good time and you know to to see how little they can get by with 
sw3035A-ms98-a-0064 409.720625 411.033000 uh

sw3035A-ms98-a-0070 432.648375 433.740250 yeah
sw3035A-ms98-a-0071 433.740250 438.892375 but uh i- i- i don't know i think uh you know some of the thing has to do with uh [vocalized-noise]
sw3035A-ms98-a-0072 438.892375 449.162375 with the civil rights program not that the civil rights program's bad but that there's it carried over into you know individual rights and it you know trickled ou[t]-
