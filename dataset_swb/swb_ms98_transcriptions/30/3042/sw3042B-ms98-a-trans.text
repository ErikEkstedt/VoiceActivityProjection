sw3042B-ms98-a-0065 290.475250 300.986250 you know but my husband is from New Jersey and he wouldn't go back either he did all the shoveling and everything else he said it was a pain so 
sw3042B-ms98-a-0066 300.986250 305.242750 [silence]
sw3042B-ms98-a-0067 305.242750 310.312250 no i don't think so well see last year we had snow at Christmas time
sw3042B-ms98-a-0068 310.312250 323.125500 so it really wasn't it was weird because we had snow [laughter] it's like wow it actually fell on the right day so uh no it's not in fact uh you know we're used to running around in
sw3042B-ms98-a-0069 323.125500 327.480750 you know Spring clothes in December and so when it throws in a real cool
sw3042B-ms98-a-0070 327.480750 339.831000 winter we get broken pipes and and all that kind of stuff and because_1 Texas is just just isn't built for you know real cold weather for long periods of time
sw3042B-ms98-a-0071 339.831000 345.180875 no not not where we are now in Houston stuff they've got it
sw3042B-ms98-a-0072 345.180875 348.239500 they've got it where no hair spray works
sw3042B-ms98-a-0073 348.239500 362.970000 it's so humid at times but here it's it's just about right it's it's pretty dry and not too dry where you know you just it hurts to breathe but we're just about right we're just having this all this rain and
sw3042B-ms98-a-0074 362.970000 371.492625 late rain has made it kind of uncomfortable made it the humidity real high but no i like it well we're right in a good stop because_1 we're
sw3042B-ms98-a-0075 371.492625 379.739750 you know we get over in the over the hundreds in the summer but it's it's not it's a dry heat and it's not really
sw3042B-ms98-a-0076 379.739750 386.491375 as hot and muggy as it would be being over hundred plus ninety degree humidity ninety percent humidity
sw3042B-ms98-a-0077 386.491375 390.799750 so 
sw3042B-ms98-a-0078 390.799750 392.994125 oh

sw3042B-ms98-a-0082 398.630000 404.990375 so we like it where we're at if it's not a whole bunch of everything at once type stuff
sw3042B-ms98-a-0083 404.990375 406.987250 so
sw3042B-ms98-a-0084 406.987250 417.319875 but no it's interesting when it gets really cold here and people forget that they're live in Texas and they don't know how to drive in snow and you know but uh 
sw3042B-ms98-a-0085 417.319875 429.447125 i wouldn't trade it for anything [laughter] i was born in Texas and i visited other areas and i'm just a sun person i think gotten used to it 
sw3042B-ms98-a-0086 429.447125 436.484875 [silence]
