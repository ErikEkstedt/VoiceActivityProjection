sw3049A-ms98-a-0039 164.198250 167.049500 [laughter]
sw3049A-ms98-a-0040 167.049500 176.553750 that's right there's nothing wrong with that go in the early hours it's a matinee it's not crowded and the the uh price is as reasonable as renting a video
sw3049A-ms98-a-0041 176.553750 191.134250 and that's the way i do it and i go quite frequently if you are going to be planning on doing that now i saw Warlock too which is supposed to be the story of a of a witch hunt that is you know magically shot into the present time 
sw3049A-ms98-a-0042 191.134250 199.060625 and the first five minutes or ten minutes of the movie was i was very well persuaded to walk out
sw3049A-ms98-a-0043 199.060625 212.173500 very well persua[ded]- there was more gore than i was interested in seeing but then the movie settled down to a comfortable action uh i can't really say that it would have gotten more than a star and a half from me either but
sw3049A-ms98-a-0044 212.173500 225.909500 uh the action was comfortable and of course i enjoyed those good guy bad guy type conflicts things so i enjoyed that movie after the first few minutes of gore and there were some others but they were done a little more tastefully
sw3049A-ms98-a-0045 225.909500 232.082000 but uh in the first scene the Warlock chopped off a guy's finger because_1 he wanted the ring and then
sw3049A-ms98-a-0046 232.082000 239.347000 bit his tongue out and spit it off in the omelet and i could not handle that i said whoa i'm glad i have not had dinner
sw3049A-ms98-a-0047 239.347000 246.662750 then uh i saw Awakening that's a wonderful wonderful job by Robin Williams and Peter De Niro
sw3049A-ms98-a-0048 246.662750 248.195750 [noise] uh
sw3049A-ms98-a-0049 248.195750 257.025250 Robert De Niro what did i say Peter i said Robert De Niro and he has done a really good job of characterizing
sw3049A-ms98-a-0050 257.025250 264.311875 [noise] the uh disabled person and of course Robin Williams always just has a
sw3049A-ms98-a-0051 264.311875 273.342125 an air about him that you can't help but enjoy what he is doing even when he's sad you know you have great faith that he will get happy again
sw3049A-ms98-a-0052 273.342125 274.722375 [silence]
sw3049A-ms98-a-0053 274.722375 283.817375 and then oh let's see there's a couple or three that i would like to go see before they go into videos i guess i can wait another month and they will be videos

sw3049A-ms98-a-0056 291.545500 300.209625 you really want some suspense that's the one to see and i understand that's a sequel to an earlier movie that showed about two weeks ago on television

sw3049A-ms98-a-0061 318.165500 332.231375 um-hum i've heard it's wonderful too but i it's just that they are both very long uh movies and the matinee starts before i get can get away from work and after after that i get involved in other things and don't want to
sw3049A-ms98-a-0062 332.231375 333.994625 don't want to go back

sw3049A-ms98-a-0083 414.634000 426.139500 i don't know uh i think that beard gives him a look that he is always grinning whether he is or not and he he has that merry look about his eyes that looks like he stays in mischief all time
