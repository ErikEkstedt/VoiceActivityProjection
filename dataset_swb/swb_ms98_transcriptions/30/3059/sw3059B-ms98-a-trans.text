sw3059B-ms98-a-0020 61.020625 62.122000 [silence]
sw3059B-ms98-a-0021 62.122000 64.867000 it's cute but kind of far out comedy
sw3059B-ms98-a-0022 64.867000 68.932375 [silence]
sw3059B-ms98-a-0023 68.932375 72.225875 yeah i uh am not one for the uh
sw3059B-ms98-a-0024 72.225875 75.496500 i don't need the suspense movies or the [laughter]

sw3059B-ms98-a-0030 88.113625 91.207875 i'm not sure [laughter] i uh
sw3059B-ms98-a-0031 91.207875 92.962125 i saw it
sw3059B-ms98-a-0032 92.962125 95.628125 and uh because my wife wanted to see it
sw3059B-ms98-a-0033 95.628125 96.712875 [silence]
sw3059B-ms98-a-0034 96.712875 101.435000 uh but on the other hand i'm not sure i would have gone otherwise and having gone
sw3059B-ms98-a-0035 101.435000 102.598500 [silence]
sw3059B-ms98-a-0036 102.598500 103.645375 uh
sw3059B-ms98-a-0037 103.645375 105.041375 [silence]
sw3059B-ms98-a-0038 105.041375 108.648250 well it really wasn't on a theme that i was uh
sw3059B-ms98-a-0039 108.648250 109.744125 [silence]
sw3059B-ms98-a-0040 109.744125 114.977500 uh that into or as i say th[e]- i prefer the light movies that
sw3059B-ms98-a-0041 114.977500 116.585000 uh my
sw3059B-ms98-a-0042 116.585000 119.231125 style of entertainment is
sw3059B-ms98-a-0043 119.231125 121.563375 is comedy
sw3059B-ms98-a-0044 121.563375 123.926000 uh primarily
sw3059B-ms98-a-0045 123.926000 127.081375 and then into action films
sw3059B-ms98-a-0046 127.081375 128.180750 what
sw3059B-ms98-a-0047 128.180750 130.603250 [silence]
sw3059B-ms98-a-0048 130.603250 134.203125 yeah you kind of have to like to be uh
sw3059B-ms98-a-0049 134.203125 137.916000 drawn to this point where you aren't sure what's going to happen
sw3059B-ms98-a-0050 137.916000 143.795375 [silence]
sw3059B-ms98-a-0051 143.795375 145.185750 uh yes
sw3059B-ms98-a-0052 145.185750 147.236125 [silence]
sw3059B-ms98-a-0053 147.236125 152.503375 uh it was interesting but i felt that one was a bit farfetched
sw3059B-ms98-a-0054 152.503375 154.823875 uh in that
sw3059B-ms98-a-0055 154.823875 156.515750 well
sw3059B-ms98-a-0056 156.515750 161.656875 i'm trying to think of the other one i saw recently the one on um Defending Your Life
sw3059B-ms98-a-0057 161.656875 163.244250 [silence]
sw3059B-ms98-a-0058 163.244250 175.007875 well that was one where uh it's kind of like to me it's somewhat like Pretty Woman the the story line um if you accept a few of the basic starting points i guess the rest falls in place
sw3059B-ms98-a-0059 175.007875 178.208500 uh it was hard to accept that uh
sw3059B-ms98-a-0060 178.208500 179.257750 [silence]
sw3059B-ms98-a-0061 179.257750 183.021375 this uh multimillionaire wheeler dealer would uh
sw3059B-ms98-a-0062 183.021375 184.352375 [silence]
sw3059B-ms98-a-0063 184.352375 189.073000 you know find himself and allow himself to get into that situation 
sw3059B-ms98-a-0064 189.073000 198.709625 [silence]
sw3059B-ms98-a-0065 198.709625 202.285625 yeah it's sort of a modern Cinderella type of story
sw3059B-ms98-a-0066 202.285625 214.680750 [silence]
sw3059B-ms98-a-0067 214.680750 215.797375 uh-huh
sw3059B-ms98-a-0068 215.797375 217.412250 [silence]
sw3059B-ms98-a-0069 217.412250 218.288875 yes
sw3059B-ms98-a-0070 218.288875 220.762250 [silence]
sw3059B-ms98-a-0071 220.762250 224.898000 uh that was i enjoyed that one
sw3059B-ms98-a-0072 224.898000 226.297375 i
sw3059B-ms98-a-0073 226.297375 228.504750 in that
sw3059B-ms98-a-0074 228.504750 238.938250 i i guess i i hate to be too surprised in a movie and in that one you could you could pretty well guess where it was going to end up you weren't sure exactly
sw3059B-ms98-a-0075 238.938250 242.422625 how it would get there but you knew where it would end up
sw3059B-ms98-a-0076 242.422625 252.264250 [silence]
sw3059B-ms98-a-0077 252.264250 253.392250 uh-huh
sw3059B-ms98-a-0078 253.392250 274.884500 [silence]
sw3059B-ms98-a-0079 274.884500 275.961500 yeah
sw3059B-ms98-a-0080 275.961500 279.102250 well whenever she starts crying [laughter]
sw3059B-ms98-a-0081 279.102250 282.178125 [silence]
sw3059B-ms98-a-0082 282.178125 284.516000 well do you go to many movies more than once
sw3059B-ms98-a-0083 284.516000 291.495000 [silence]
sw3059B-ms98-a-0084 291.495000 292.487625 uh-huh
sw3059B-ms98-a-0085 292.487625 302.445375 [silence]
sw3059B-ms98-a-0086 302.445375 304.548750 uh-huh well these days it's
sw3059B-ms98-a-0087 304.548750 305.557875 [silence]
sw3059B-ms98-a-0088 305.557875 306.609625 uh
sw3059B-ms98-a-0089 306.609625 309.015250 [silence]
sw3059B-ms98-a-0090 309.015250 313.778000 well if you don't with some of the movies if you don't go to them within
sw3059B-ms98-a-0091 313.778000 316.915250 the first four weeks the movie may have
sw3059B-ms98-a-0092 316.915250 321.642375 uh left town never to show up again until it comes back in video
sw3059B-ms98-a-0093 321.642375 322.642375 [silence]
sw3059B-ms98-a-0094 322.642375 327.492875 so uh unless a movie is popular and stays around
sw3059B-ms98-a-0095 327.492875 329.121000 uh
sw3059B-ms98-a-0096 329.121000 334.290000 you probably will see it on video these days more likely than at the movie
sw3059B-ms98-a-0097 334.290000 335.759000 [silence]
sw3059B-ms98-a-0098 335.759000 337.562375 so we have um
sw3059B-ms98-a-0099 337.562375 345.449000 well i think just most people have VCRs now and we probably watch twice as many movies at home
sw3059B-ms98-a-0100 345.449000 348.315375 as we do at movie theaters
sw3059B-ms98-a-0101 348.315375 364.817000 [silence]
sw3059B-ms98-a-0102 364.817000 366.929125 did you go to Dances With Wolves
sw3059B-ms98-a-0103 366.929125 369.777375 [silence]
sw3059B-ms98-a-0104 369.777375 374.604375 i at least what i hear on that one that it's coming out a second time in a
sw3059B-ms98-a-0105 374.604375 376.641625 in a longer version
sw3059B-ms98-a-0106 376.641625 380.309250 even though it was a long movie it's sort of the uncut version
sw3059B-ms98-a-0107 380.309250 383.406250 at least that was some of the rumors we'll have to see because it's
sw3059B-ms98-a-0108 383.406250 384.524000 [silence]
sw3059B-ms98-a-0109 384.524000 391.244750 uh there was some talk about that i maybe it will come out this fall there we're sort of in the middle of the summer um
sw3059B-ms98-a-0110 391.244750 403.957125 season of a lot of new movies coming out but then there's these um periods like early fall before Christmas or early spring when there's sort of a quiet period where if you bring something out again
sw3059B-ms98-a-0111 403.957125 405.720125 it uh
sw3059B-ms98-a-0112 405.720125 408.635250 will increase the revenues from the movie
sw3059B-ms98-a-0113 408.635250 413.994125 [silence]
sw3059B-ms98-a-0114 413.994125 419.922375 oh i i'd actually have to get a newspaper out my approach to movies is i kind of hear about them
sw3059B-ms98-a-0115 419.922375 425.364625 uh i keep track of them a little but you know ask me to name the ten that are out there right now
sw3059B-ms98-a-0116 425.364625 427.187875 and i'd have to say
sw3059B-ms98-a-0117 427.187875 431.841250 uh i uh i don't know i i just look at the newspaper before i decide to go and
sw3059B-ms98-a-0118 431.841250 437.703000 [silence]
sw3059B-ms98-a-0119 437.703000 439.497500 uh it's kind of
sw3059B-ms98-a-0120 439.497500 442.164500 Where's Bob or What About Bob
sw3059B-ms98-a-0121 442.164500 444.112000 [silence]
sw3059B-ms98-a-0122 444.112000 445.013500 yeah
sw3059B-ms98-a-0123 445.013500 449.436250 because some of them they uh they'll start in one area of the country and if they
sw3059B-ms98-a-0124 449.436250 450.321750 it's act[ually]-
