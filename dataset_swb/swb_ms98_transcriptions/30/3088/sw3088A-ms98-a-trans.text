sw3088A-ms98-a-0007 50.235625 56.499250 and i don't have a problem at all with employers uh testing in the hiring process
sw3088A-ms98-a-0008 56.499250 58.876500 but i- i- i don't
sw3088A-ms98-a-0009 58.876500 68.129750 i don't have a problem with them too much testing even after the fact but i do a little bit where it where it wouldn't hurt anybody
sw3088A-ms98-a-0010 68.129750 71.582125 i don't know sometimes i think they carry it a little bit too far
sw3088A-ms98-a-0011 71.582125 73.145125 but

sw3088A-ms98-a-0029 120.045500 130.800000 i- i wish they would and that i think is even probably more widely abused by you know the masses than than drugs so to speak
sw3088A-ms98-a-0030 130.800000 132.056000 so
sw3088A-ms98-a-0031 132.056000 134.172625 [silence]

sw3088A-ms98-a-0039 147.296250 149.065875 yeah and
sw3088A-ms98-a-0040 149.065875 158.232000 now TI has the random testing policy and and you know our names or our employee numbers or whatever are in a in a pool
sw3088A-ms98-a-0041 158.232000 165.828125 you know so i've already been tested once when i was hired and and once since they initiated this random testing program
sw3088A-ms98-a-0042 165.828125 173.750250 but i work with one girl who was tested her name got got randomly selected three times in six months
sw3088A-ms98-a-0043 173.750250 184.656875 and i think that's the only reason i have a problem with it when there's no you know there's no reason to suspect someone you know that that's getting a little bit that's enough to make anybody paranoid [laughter]
sw3088A-ms98-a-0044 184.656875 185.689625 [laughter]

sw3088A-ms98-a-0052 206.778500 211.226125 you were just the lucky or the unlucky one depending on how you look at it
sw3088A-ms98-a-0053 211.226125 218.868625 [silence]
sw3088A-ms98-a-0054 218.868625 220.991500 oh absolutely
sw3088A-ms98-a-0055 220.991500 224.837625 [silence]
sw3088A-ms98-a-0056 224.837625 231.869000 there are so many people with with their petty axes to grind it could really get out of hand and
sw3088A-ms98-a-0057 231.869000 243.884375 [silence]
sw3088A-ms98-a-0058 243.884375 245.116750 yeah
sw3088A-ms98-a-0059 245.116750 247.718875 [silence]
sw3088A-ms98-a-0060 247.718875 254.491750 to report it and i guess you'd report that to a supervisor maybe anonymously or something
sw3088A-ms98-a-0061 254.491750 255.870625 [silence]
sw3088A-ms98-a-0062 255.870625 266.347500 because i- i would feel very uncomfortable working with someone i knew was using either illegal drugs or abusing alcohol i'd just i'd feel really uncomfortable
sw3088A-ms98-a-0063 266.347500 274.653375 [silence]
sw3088A-ms98-a-0064 274.653375 286.760125 yeah we have we have a lot of people who work on the line i'm in accounting so it wouldn't you know the[y]- they couldn't hurt me with their ten key or something but out on the line they've got people working some serious equipment
sw3088A-ms98-a-0065 286.760125 287.830750 [silence]
sw3088A-ms98-a-0066 287.830750 288.974250 so
sw3088A-ms98-a-0067 288.974250 305.411000 [silence]
sw3088A-ms98-a-0068 305.411000 308.246000 put at risk i agree totally
sw3088A-ms98-a-0069 308.246000 321.952125 [silence]
sw3088A-ms98-a-0070 321.952125 330.313500 and in the long run we're all paying for that [noise] so it's i mean it it protects us in the long run hopefully when they do that 
sw3088A-ms98-a-0071 330.313500 334.466250 i- i was trying to remember there was a court case
sw3088A-ms98-a-0072 334.466250 346.554625 uh he[re]- here where i live just a few months ago the city workers they wanted to um the city government wanted to institute the random drug testing
sw3088A-ms98-a-0073 346.554625 351.258250 and the city workers uh took them to court
sw3088A-ms98-a-0074 351.258250 358.956750 to protest saying that it invaded their i guess first a[mendment]- the the search and seizure amendment
sw3088A-ms98-a-0075 358.956750 367.322250 and it's still tied up in the legal channels they haven't ruled on whether they can test them or not
sw3088A-ms98-a-0076 367.322250 377.728125 so i'm curious especially since TI a local you know employer is also already doing it seeing what what they'll say about it especially since
sw3088A-ms98-a-0077 377.728125 379.778625 [silence]
sw3088A-ms98-a-0078 379.778625 383.200500 well it's the whole it's the whole city
sw3088A-ms98-a-0079 383.200500 387.791875 seems like the whole group of city employees that's raising a stink over it
sw3088A-ms98-a-0080 387.791875 390.548625 yeah so
sw3088A-ms98-a-0081 390.548625 397.531750 [silence]

sw3088A-ms98-a-0088 411.869000 421.673875 yeah that's the way i looked at it if i had something to hide it's one thing but i'm you know you know you don't so it's not as big a deal and you sometimes wonder when these people protest so much [laughter]
sw3088A-ms98-a-0089 421.673875 426.681000 whether they're really concerned about their rights or whether they're really concerned about something else
sw3088A-ms98-a-0090 426.681000 433.081625 [silence]
sw3088A-ms98-a-0091 433.081625 435.143500 i don't believe that
