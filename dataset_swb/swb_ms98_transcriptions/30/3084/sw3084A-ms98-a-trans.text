sw3084A-ms98-a-0012 57.841250 62.526625 finances i make a big chart at the beginning of the year and
sw3084A-ms98-a-0013 62.526625 68.286000 each column you know is each different expense and then
sw3084A-ms98-a-0014 68.286000 71.749875 i add them up at the end of each month

sw3084A-ms98-a-0050 226.737125 234.652375 well maybe homes for have always been built more sturdier in the north than down here because of the
sw3084A-ms98-a-0051 234.652375 237.775375 snows and winters and everything
