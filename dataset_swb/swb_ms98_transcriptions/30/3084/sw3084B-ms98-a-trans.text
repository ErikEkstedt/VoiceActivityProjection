sw3084B-ms98-a-0006 9.091000 11.148875 i don't have a set budget
sw3084B-ms98-a-0007 11.148875 16.116875 i just [laughter] know what i have coming in and i know what i have to
sw3084B-ms98-a-0008 16.116875 19.223375 keep in reserve in order to survive
sw3084B-ms98-a-0009 19.223375 32.432750 [silence]
sw3084B-ms98-a-0010 32.432750 33.465125 unex[pected]-
sw3084B-ms98-a-0011 33.465125 34.964000 unexpected

sw3084B-ms98-a-0014 41.441000 44.717000 [vocalized-noise] 
sw3084B-ms98-a-0015 44.717000 50.312000 [laughter] so that's why we always have to have a reserve somewhere so we can
sw3084B-ms98-a-0016 50.312000 52.935000 not be caught shorthanded
sw3084B-ms98-a-0017 52.935000 54.590000 uh-huh
sw3084B-ms98-a-0018 54.590000 75.024375 [silence]

sw3084B-ms98-a-0022 88.171375 91.579125 do you kind of forecast yourself for the year or not
sw3084B-ms98-a-0023 91.579125 92.785375 [silence]
sw3084B-ms98-a-0024 92.785375 98.278750 make a forecast of what you think your expenses and then compare what the actual costs are
sw3084B-ms98-a-0025 98.278750 108.986000 [silence]
sw3084B-ms98-a-0026 108.986000 110.628875 but y[ou]-

sw3084B-ms98-a-0037 164.904000 166.500375 [silence]
sw3084B-ms98-a-0038 166.500375 173.682125 you know it really is a shame the way they build houses though because you can go over to England and look at those castles that are
sw3084B-ms98-a-0039 173.682125 176.617625 four and five hundred years old and they're like
sw3084B-ms98-a-0040 176.617625 182.442625 you know so like a Rock of Gibraltar they're so steady and steadfast and
sw3084B-ms98-a-0041 182.442625 184.879625 just rigorous constructed
sw3084B-ms98-a-0042 184.879625 186.197500 [silence]
sw3084B-ms98-a-0043 186.197500 189.384750 and our homes here in the States you know they're made to
sw3084B-ms98-a-0044 189.384750 191.545875 a good wind would blow them over
sw3084B-ms98-a-0045 191.545875 193.311000 [silence]
sw3084B-ms98-a-0046 193.311000 199.194750 which is really a shame for the to speak of the building industry like that
sw3084B-ms98-a-0047 199.194750 201.063250 [silence]
sw3084B-ms98-a-0048 201.063250 202.445125 i mean the all

sw3084B-ms98-a-0050 203.789000 208.213500 well much faster than they did when i was a child growing up
sw3084B-ms98-a-0051 208.213500 211.746375 i mean those houses were made to last
sw3084B-ms98-a-0052 211.746375 212.954500 [silence]
sw3084B-ms98-a-0053 212.954500 214.172625 in Detroit

sw3084B-ms98-a-0055 218.251625 227.937250 oh yes solid foundations and wet plaster walls and hardwood floors and the whole bit yes
sw3084B-ms98-a-0056 227.937250 237.513375 [silence]
sw3084B-ms98-a-0057 237.513375 245.848250 well i see i don't have anything to base that on because i was an adult when i moved here i've been in Dallas about twelve years and
sw3084B-ms98-a-0058 245.848250 246.977500 [silence]
sw3084B-ms98-a-0059 246.977500 250.171000 you know i haven't really seen um
sw3084B-ms98-a-0060 250.171000 257.669125 a quality home even the homes that i see that are that they're building out in North Dallas where they're paying
sw3084B-ms98-a-0061 257.669125 265.824500 just thousands and thousands of dollars for they're using plywood on i mean pressed board on the roof
sw3084B-ms98-a-0062 265.824500 268.936000 if i was the buyer i'd have a fit
sw3084B-ms98-a-0063 268.936000 270.231625 [silence]
sw3084B-ms98-a-0064 270.231625 272.298625 they're not even using
sw3084B-ms98-a-0065 272.298625 273.939000 um
sw3084B-ms98-a-0066 273.939000 275.593375 a pure wood produc[t]-
sw3084B-ms98-a-0067 275.593375 276.782375 [silence]
sw3084B-ms98-a-0068 276.782375 279.507250 well no not not plywood pressed wood
sw3084B-ms98-a-0069 279.507250 282.928875 you know where they take all these remnants and press them together
sw3084B-ms98-a-0070 282.928875 284.617000 [silence]
sw3084B-ms98-a-0071 284.617000 289.658000 i would've i would have a complete fit if i saw my new home being built like that
sw3084B-ms98-a-0072 289.658000 297.857625 [silence]
sw3084B-ms98-a-0073 297.857625 301.609500 i think we should have steel girders in our homes and there're not
sw3084B-ms98-a-0074 301.609500 302.716000 [silence]
sw3084B-ms98-a-0075 302.716000 304.763625 i i just um
sw3084B-ms98-a-0076 304.763625 306.245250 it's just
sw3084B-ms98-a-0077 306.245250 314.619000 it's ridiculous i just feel very very disheartened ab[out]- about the way i see the building industry go
sw3084B-ms98-a-0078 314.619000 320.618375 no wonder you know the hail damage is so extensive and and things like that where it shouldn't be
sw3084B-ms98-a-0079 320.618375 321.823250 [silence]
sw3084B-ms98-a-0080 321.823250 327.167375 and your homes if they ca[tch]- catch on fire they go up within a matter of minutes rather than
sw3084B-ms98-a-0081 327.167375 331.258750 you know uh it takes a long time for the fire really to get a hold
sw3084B-ms98-a-0082 331.258750 332.428000 [silence]
sw3084B-ms98-a-0083 332.428000 336.234375 because they're inf[erior]- they're using inferior inflammable material
sw3084B-ms98-a-0084 336.234375 346.390625 [silence]
sw3084B-ms98-a-0085 346.390625 353.777125 well see they should have known that they should have made uh they should have dipped them and and prevented and made them fire proof
sw3084B-ms98-a-0086 353.777125 361.142500 they they knew you know they knew i mean you know where are our engineers at our building engineers
sw3084B-ms98-a-0087 361.142500 367.951875 [silence]
sw3084B-ms98-a-0088 367.951875 374.381875 well yeah there are codes well it's their the building codes and the building laws are too slack
sw3084B-ms98-a-0089 374.381875 377.741250 that's what's wrong they're not stringent enough
sw3084B-ms98-a-0090 377.741250 383.760250 they're not after the consumer they're after the builder they're protecting the builder and not the consumer
sw3084B-ms98-a-0091 383.760250 385.768500 [silence]
