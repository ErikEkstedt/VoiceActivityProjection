sw3052B-ms98-a-0005 33.564875 36.817000 are are they living independently right now
sw3052B-ms98-a-0006 36.817000 42.684500 oh ha[ve]- have you looked at any homes for them or talked to them about that

sw3052B-ms98-a-0009 78.855500 83.410000 [silence]
sw3052B-ms98-a-0010 83.410000 92.779375 well even at that point most care can be given at in the home that sound like just an excellent solution you must feel real good about that
sw3052B-ms98-a-0011 92.779375 128.857500 [silence]
sw3052B-ms98-a-0012 128.857500 130.290250 um-hum

sw3052B-ms98-a-0018 154.637625 158.194125 well it's you know [vocalized-noise] i think we just
sw3052B-ms98-a-0019 158.194125 166.755375 y[ou]- y[ou]- you know listen to is the fact that there are good sol[utions]- solutions both inside and outside of nursing homes it's just a matter of
sw3052B-ms98-a-0020 166.755375 176.550750 finding a good home and and then of course there is always the problem of being able to able to afford either of those solutions
sw3052B-ms98-a-0021 176.550750 189.373125 and that i think is what is scary and i also feel that that's where some of the bad images um of nursing homes come from is when people have to put people in a nursing homes and they really can not afford the best
sw3052B-ms98-a-0022 189.373125 205.139125 [silence]

sw3052B-ms98-a-0029 243.758750 248.295125 what a shame they put him in the home so that he could be cared for
sw3052B-ms98-a-0030 248.295125 252.694125 and then then they could have done that well at home
sw3052B-ms98-a-0031 252.694125 255.785125 [silence]
sw3052B-ms98-a-0032 255.785125 257.620500 oh

sw3052B-ms98-a-0043 306.787500 311.131875 well good good i'm glad they have a solution
sw3052B-ms98-a-0044 311.131875 313.858375 to do that yes i know
sw3052B-ms98-a-0045 313.858375 319.315000 [silence]
sw3052B-ms98-a-0046 319.315000 321.555875 e[xactly]- exactly my um
sw3052B-ms98-a-0047 321.555875 331.728500 [noise] my ex-husband's grandmother had been in a nursing home now for oh it must be seven eight years and um
sw3052B-ms98-a-0048 331.728500 342.574625 it's ju[st]- just her her condition deteriorated deteriorated instantly upon getting into that home as the situation is so 
sw3052B-ms98-a-0049 342.574625 345.164250 sad because
sw3052B-ms98-a-0050 345.164250 348.290500 it just takes all the dignity away from 
sw3052B-ms98-a-0051 348.290500 353.764125 from people who have been independent all their lives this was a really neat vital woman
sw3052B-ms98-a-0052 353.764125 363.341750 and you get in a nursing home and the first thing that happens you have to share your your whole living space with someone that you have never known before in your life
sw3052B-ms98-a-0053 363.341750 364.362750 [silence]
sw3052B-ms98-a-0054 364.362750 366.573375 and oh i
sw3052B-ms98-a-0055 366.573375 375.708125 i do not know w[hat]- what the answer is but i do know that there are some wonderful places out there and
sw3052B-ms98-a-0056 375.708125 376.714250 [silence]
sw3052B-ms98-a-0057 376.714250 381.184500 it i think it does a lot of it goes down to just money
sw3052B-ms98-a-0058 381.184500 390.362750 and family support uh if you you know have family that uh you can live with right
sw3052B-ms98-a-0059 390.362750 391.725750 right
sw3052B-ms98-a-0060 391.725750 399.853750 i- i really i think the way of selecting a nursing home would be similar to the way you would select child care
sw3052B-ms98-a-0061 399.853750 404.062875 you know you'd do your research and you would go visit
sw3052B-ms98-a-0062 404.062875 409.471625 and uh hopefully they would have they would have it so that you could go there anytime
sw3052B-ms98-a-0063 409.471625 415.144125 because if you could not go there anytime then that would make you a little bit right
sw3052B-ms98-a-0064 415.144125 430.908750 [silence]
sw3052B-ms98-a-0065 430.908750 432.476875 um-hum
