sw3052A-ms98-a-0041 228.075500 231.333000 so i told them he strangled on some chicken
sw3052A-ms98-a-0042 231.333000 241.936250 and uh they said the the woman the wife said he was not even supposed to be eating any food like that that would require chewing or
sw3052A-ms98-a-0043 241.936250 244.695125 so you know and i [laughter-thought]

sw3052A-ms98-a-0053 297.421750 303.030375 of nursing home care but the family were all talking about um
sw3052A-ms98-a-0054 303.030375 307.455500 putting him in another home they said he will not go back

sw3052A-ms98-a-0082 423.253125 432.048500 i guess there was not a name for what she had at that time but i guess Alzheimer's would come as close as anything she really was not aware of what she was doing
sw3052A-ms98-a-0083 432.048500 433.775250 and uh
sw3052A-ms98-a-0084 433.775250 445.192250 i ca[n]- i can remember she had several strokes and the nursing home was right next to a hospital and they'd rush her to the hospital and revive her and just bring her back to the nursing home
sw3052A-ms98-a-0085 445.192250 449.942250 in a couple of days and it was she was it was just like keeping something a[live]-
