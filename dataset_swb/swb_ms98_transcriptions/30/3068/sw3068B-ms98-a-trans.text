sw3068B-ms98-a-0016 46.003250 50.934375 to a parent well you know the thing is when you're a kid
sw3068B-ms98-a-0017 50.934375 64.676375 and the kid at that age especially if they're going into undergraduate it seems like they think they know what they want an and i mean choosing from my experience you know my i thought you know my i know what i want a lot more than my parents know what i want
sw3068B-ms98-a-0018 64.676375 65.953750 but uh
sw3068B-ms98-a-0019 65.953750 72.153875 i don't know at the same time you have to decide what is important about the school you know the size of it or

sw3068B-ms98-a-0039 250.150250 261.676250 yeah yeah i think uh i would agree with that in fact the thing that i'm going through the same thing where in graduate school i was trying to choose you know a particular institution might be better
sw3068B-ms98-a-0040 261.676250 263.708625 for my area yet
sw3068B-ms98-a-0041 263.708625 277.345500 like say you know the University of Small Town in Arkansas or something might have some top specialists in my area yet if i go to U of I or CMU or you know some you know any big name school
sw3068B-ms98-a-0042 277.345500 285.644000 my quality of education might not be that much better but it's the same thing as you know what will the name recognition get me kind of thing
sw3068B-ms98-a-0043 285.644000 290.051625 yeah [laughter-yeah] that's that's usually the basic criteria
sw3068B-ms98-a-0044 290.051625 291.354000 [silence]
sw3068B-ms98-a-0045 291.354000 292.434375 yeah

sw3068B-ms98-a-0063 388.002750 399.582625 yeah i- i guess another thing that concerns me is uh so many people it seems like everybody today is still in that [vocalized-noise] job market [noise] and uh
sw3068B-ms98-a-0064 399.582625 406.202750 um where was i at oh go[ing]- in going to school you get taught
sw3068B-ms98-a-0065 406.202750 411.553000 [vocalized-noise] the things you learn in school but there is also a whole other dimension i mean the growing up while you're going to school part
sw3068B-ms98-a-0066 411.553000 424.195500 and uh actually in the Midwest especially a lot of the schools have like University of Missouri will have a main campus like Columbia which is big multi disciplinary and they'll have a satellite campus in a usually in a smaller town
sw3068B-ms98-a-0067 424.195500 428.023000 that specializes in the technical field so you've really uh
sw3068B-ms98-a-0068 428.023000 434.005000 i guess sacrificed some social exposure to different groups and everything
sw3068B-ms98-a-0069 434.005000 435.192500 [silence]
sw3068B-ms98-a-0070 435.192500 436.561875 yeah
