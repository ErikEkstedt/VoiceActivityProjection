sw3068A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.519375 [noise]
sw3068A-ms98-a-0002 0.519375 2.530000 well Steve did you go to college
sw3068A-ms98-a-0003 2.530000 3.775375 [silence]
sw3068A-ms98-a-0004 3.775375 6.764250 oh that's good so you probably could give some great advice
sw3068A-ms98-a-0005 6.764250 11.484375 [silence]
sw3068A-ms98-a-0006 11.484375 12.551875 uh-huh
sw3068A-ms98-a-0007 12.551875 15.613875 well what's your ca[reer]- what's your interest your uh
sw3068A-ms98-a-0008 15.613875 17.729375 [silence]
sw3068A-ms98-a-0009 17.729375 21.715500 uh-huh that that's similar to what i'm in a PhD program right now
sw3068A-ms98-a-0010 21.715500 33.829000 and uh my area of expertise it's information systems which is a little bit less technical i think than uh than computer science but my area of expertise is uh uh human computer interaction
sw3068A-ms98-a-0011 33.829000 39.021000 and i think that's one reason why i'm part of this study uh because it's of i'm working with voice systems
sw3068A-ms98-a-0012 39.021000 46.601875 [noise] yeah so so good luck i guess we should talk about giving advice though wh[at]- what wh[at]- what type of advice do you think you'd give to a a parent
sw3068A-ms98-a-0013 46.601875 47.988625 yeah
sw3068A-ms98-a-0014 47.988625 50.379875 [silence]
sw3068A-ms98-a-0015 50.379875 51.643750 um-hum
sw3068A-ms98-a-0016 51.643750 56.904500 [silence]
sw3068A-ms98-a-0017 56.904500 58.256750 yeah
sw3068A-ms98-a-0018 58.256750 63.321625 [silence]
sw3068A-ms98-a-0019 63.321625 64.584875 uh-huh
sw3068A-ms98-a-0020 64.584875 71.454000 [silence]
sw3068A-ms98-a-0021 71.454000 77.822625 yeah i think that's more important probably than even the career vocation because most people change
sw3068A-ms98-a-0022 77.822625 82.649000 i kn[ow]- i know very few people that uh started in one field and stayed with it
sw3068A-ms98-a-0023 82.649000 90.501500 you know they i think that's what you just said you know having to do more with the size of the school the environment of the school uh
sw3068A-ms98-a-0024 90.501500 99.081625 i think that's much more important i- i think i'd i'd advise a parent to send a kid to a school though that has a number of different types of programs you know that uh
sw3068A-ms98-a-0025 99.081625 104.160250 some of the smaller schools might be very limited in what they can offer but some of the
sw3068A-ms98-a-0026 104.160250 117.365375 uh small some of the larger small schools you know i guess around three or four thousand students have a can offer a broader range of curriculums and things so if the kid does change they don't have to transfer or they don't have to uh
sw3068A-ms98-a-0027 117.365375 122.222125 uh i don't know they don't have to give up years of you know of credit transfer and things
sw3068A-ms98-a-0028 122.222125 123.483125 [silence]
sw3068A-ms98-a-0029 123.483125 124.500500 yeah [noise]
sw3068A-ms98-a-0030 124.500500 130.514625 i- i normally and and parents hate to hear this you know because i- i actually teach college i- i hate to uh
sw3068A-ms98-a-0031 130.514625 134.212875 i hate to talk to the parents because um [noise]
sw3068A-ms98-a-0032 134.212875 144.427000 one of the reasons is because you know the kid doesn't know exactly what they want and i always say make sure you major in something that you like even if it's not going to be your career vocation
sw3068A-ms98-a-0033 144.427000 158.874750 because you'll get better grades i- i think most employers would probably rather hire you know a a three six in um [noise] in history uh to be a salesman than someone with a two oh in business administration
sw3068A-ms98-a-0034 158.874750 160.405500 that make sense
sw3068A-ms98-a-0035 160.405500 161.786500 [silence]
sw3068A-ms98-a-0036 161.786500 170.162750 yeah i always you know tell them_1 that you should major in something you you're going to get good grades in because that that's always i think more important
sw3068A-ms98-a-0037 170.162750 171.958875 you know overall
sw3068A-ms98-a-0038 171.958875 173.289625 i don't know
sw3068A-ms98-a-0039 173.289625 174.428000 [silence]
sw3068A-ms98-a-0040 174.428000 178.002000 yeah oh you you're at the office now you are at work yeah
sw3068A-ms98-a-0041 178.002000 183.636375 [silence]
sw3068A-ms98-a-0042 183.636375 187.846000 [noise] i would i would it would i- i tell you i live in Maryland
sw3068A-ms98-a-0043 187.846000 195.429625 and the public schools here are pretty good i teach at a public school actually and i know that the SAT scores for our admitting
sw3068A-ms98-a-0044 195.429625 208.021375 freshmen are higher than a lot of the public sch[ool]- a lot of the private schools and um i actually i would full time at a at a public school and then right now i'm teaching part time at a private school at a Catholic institution 
sw3068A-ms98-a-0045 208.021375 214.911750 and um [noise] and i really think i i think i'm getting a better caliber of student at the private school
sw3068A-ms98-a-0046 214.911750 222.629750 because i think their parents pay more and i think the kids are a little bit more challenged because their parents are probably college educated
sw3068A-ms98-a-0047 222.629750 232.031250 where at the public school i don't think as many parents are public are are college educated and i don't i think because it costs less the kid doesn't take it quite as serious
sw3068A-ms98-a-0048 232.031250 239.595750 you know they're not [vocalized-noise] it it's the minimal cost but i think you can get a good education at public or private
sw3068A-ms98-a-0049 239.595750 250.709500 uh but i think you can also get a bad education at public or private you know i you have to really you have to look around at the school i- i think the bad part is that most parents or kids don't know what to look for
sw3068A-ms98-a-0050 250.709500 256.506500 [silence]
sw3068A-ms98-a-0051 256.506500 257.722625 um-hum

sw3068A-ms98-a-0060 282.643000 286.790000 right yeah does it have a big ten football team or is it
sw3068A-ms98-a-0061 286.790000 287.922625 [silence]
sw3068A-ms98-a-0062 287.922625 296.223500 yeah i mean uh yeah is it a PAC ten school you know but i think yeah see i'm i'm at the University of Maryland so in this this region
sw3068A-ms98-a-0063 296.223500 302.327000 um though i go to a smaller branch of the University of Maryland my diploma will still say University of Maryland um
sw3068A-ms98-a-0064 302.327000 316.025125 [noise] you know it doesn't doesn't differentiate on my diploma though i would put it on my resume what program i went to but i- i think you know i'm actually at a smaller program i'm not at the coll[ege]- the big College Park campus you know that's the big one with the football team
sw3068A-ms98-a-0065 316.025125 323.198125 so i- i think um [noise] i think you're right that there's a lot of there's difficult decisions there based on name recognition um 
sw3068A-ms98-a-0066 323.198125 333.802375 [noise] you know when i first was applying for graduate schools i applied to some big programs you know in this area like Stevens Institute of Technology which is recognized in the Northeast as as
sw3068A-ms98-a-0067 333.802375 344.521250 you know one step below MIT in a since you know so it's got big name recognition in this area a big science school no football team but a big science school and technical people know that
sw3068A-ms98-a-0068 344.521250 351.750750 but i don't yeah i think you're right you really have to think about that for the job i went to a very small state college when i got my bachelor's
sw3068A-ms98-a-0069 351.750750 359.010500 and when i now i was in education at first when i was looking for jobs i was going to be a teacher i was just a high school teacher so
sw3068A-ms98-a-0070 359.010500 366.024750 most people recognized that institution because it was a teaching school sort of you know but then when i went um [noise]
sw3068A-ms98-a-0071 366.024750 378.159625 for graduate work you know or for a new job people said to me you know Shippensburg State where is that you [laughter-know] and you know when i went into higher education even at other universities they weren't aware of it you know
sw3068A-ms98-a-0072 378.159625 388.586750 so i think yeah that's important um [noise] i think it depends on if you want to be a if you want a regional job or a national job you need that first job or so out of school too
sw3068A-ms98-a-0073 388.586750 410.406625 [silence]

sw3068A-ms98-a-0081 433.203375 446.644750 yeah depending on your technical areas yeah i could see that but you know at some of the large schools i know that at at at University of Maryland where i am you know in a PhD program i- i haven't even met uh someone outside of
sw3068A-ms98-a-0082 446.644750 450.132000 my area of information systems except for
