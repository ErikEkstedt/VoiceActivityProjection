sw3051B-ms98-a-0008 23.802875 25.555875 [silence]
sw3051B-ms98-a-0009 25.555875 33.375875 yeah well we've we had this one for five years now before that we lived in Garland uh
sw3051B-ms98-a-0010 33.375875 41.875375 probably about you know four blocks away liked the area chose to stay inside of Spring Park it's a uh
sw3051B-ms98-a-0011 41.875375 49.723125 i don't know if you have been up here but it is a residential homeowners association so there's a lot of you know activities a lot of pluses and common land
sw3051B-ms98-a-0012 49.723125 57.364000 but uh we thought we were buying at the bottom of the market you know it could not possibly have gone any lower and so we were wrong [laughter]
sw3051B-ms98-a-0013 57.364000 58.487375 [silence]
sw3051B-ms98-a-0014 58.487375 59.692250 yeah
sw3051B-ms98-a-0015 59.692250 63.909500 i think what it bottom out about a ye[ar]- year later
sw3051B-ms98-a-0016 63.909500 71.612375 [silence]
sw3051B-ms98-a-0017 71.612375 75.712250 oddly enough two years you know i- i think that
sw3051B-ms98-a-0018 75.712250 80.705875 not in in in this area because_1 this is about like the
sw3051B-ms98-a-0019 80.705875 82.592125 yeah
sw3051B-ms98-a-0020 82.592125 86.685625 [silence]
sw3051B-ms98-a-0021 86.685625 100.571125 no it's it's Richardson it's uh Richardson and hold on a second <b_aside> Paul i can hear you perfectly perfectly well i don't want to hear you you are being rude whatever you ask or scream when i'm on the phone the answer is no do you understand <e_aside>
sw3051B-ms98-a-0022 100.571125 101.787875 [silence]
sw3051B-ms98-a-0023 101.787875 103.527000 how does that sound
sw3051B-ms98-a-0024 103.527000 113.930000 yeah there i go yeah yeah well i hate to say how long that will last too no this area up here is uh [noise] all custom homes and it's
sw3051B-ms98-a-0025 113.930000 124.447500 i- i don't think that many by the builder that we that built this house and we were not the first people the first owners i think we are the third owners it was built by the architect for himself
sw3051B-ms98-a-0026 124.447500 132.036125 who never moved into it who sold it to a couple who had no idea that homes ever needed upkeep [noise]
sw3051B-ms98-a-0027 132.036125 143.983000 oh yeah caulking windows was a great mystery to them you know you know they just watched the water pour in on the carpet but it's a Sharif Myneer Homes if that means anything it did not really mean anything to me except i liked it
sw3051B-ms98-a-0028 143.983000 146.742500 [silence]
sw3051B-ms98-a-0029 146.742500 158.942000 he builds eight hundred thousand dollar houses now i think he got out of the lower end market and decided but the houses here in in this class of housing never dropped to below two hundred
sw3051B-ms98-a-0030 158.942000 173.166750 yeah well [laughter] but [noise] still i know that this one was built for two ninety nine which is nowhere near what we paid for it and i think or somebody told me it's also on a creek side lot heavily wooded off the golf course 
sw3051B-ms98-a-0031 173.166750 181.747750 yeah and the guy around the corner is being transferred so he said uh well he did comparable that it's about eighty dollars
sw3051B-ms98-a-0032 181.747750 183.285500 i think it was
sw3051B-ms98-a-0033 183.285500 194.521500 i don't remember if he said it was sixty dollars a square foot off the creek and eighty on the creek or if it was eighty and a hundred i think it was sixty eighty
sw3051B-ms98-a-0034 194.521500 195.858000 i think
sw3051B-ms98-a-0035 195.858000 206.573500 [silence]
sw3051B-ms98-a-0036 206.573500 210.777875 well try and think if it was a hundred dollars a square foot
sw3051B-ms98-a-0037 210.777875 221.399000 no it could not be because this house is around thirty four hundred square feet and it would never sell for three hundred forty thousand dollars just never
sw3051B-ms98-a-0038 221.399000 222.936250 [silence]
sw3051B-ms98-a-0039 222.936250 228.551375 now maybe you know that's that's pretty close to what it would have sold for uh brand new
sw3051B-ms98-a-0040 228.551375 242.888500 or and that's pretty much what it was built for it's got an awful lot of nice things in it but you know i don't think i think it's going to be a long time if ever when nice things and really quality construction and all the other additional amenities
sw3051B-ms98-a-0041 242.888500 246.299125 are really uh
sw3051B-ms98-a-0042 246.299125 250.775250 desirable it's seems like people go for square footage only now
sw3051B-ms98-a-0043 250.775250 255.153375 and uh because_1 have you been back to the Perry Homes back here
sw3051B-ms98-a-0044 255.153375 258.136750 [silence]
sw3051B-ms98-a-0045 258.136750 260.071125 the one that looks like Monopoly apartments
sw3051B-ms98-a-0046 260.071125 270.968750 [silence]
sw3051B-ms98-a-0047 270.968750 280.586375 they are huge when you are inside them_1 they're very spacious they're you know i was i was in one today it was forty two hundred square feet
sw3051B-ms98-a-0048 280.586375 282.704000 yeah uh-huh
sw3051B-ms98-a-0049 282.704000 295.261250 [silence]
sw3051B-ms98-a-0050 295.261250 302.575000 see when you have kids you like to be able to send them some place where they can yell and you won't hear them but i have been watching these houses go up and i- i
sw3051B-ms98-a-0051 302.575000 311.533500 don't well somebody was telling me i know somebody who lives back there i've always questioned the quality of construction and i- i don't think they exceed more than twelve nails per house
sw3051B-ms98-a-0052 311.533500 319.009875 when you watch them_1 go up you are just amazed that they do not fall over and it takes them_1 something like thirty days to complete a house
sw3051B-ms98-a-0053 319.009875 337.436375 [silence]
sw3051B-ms98-a-0054 337.436375 338.415000 um-hum
sw3051B-ms98-a-0055 338.415000 343.000000 [silence]
sw3051B-ms98-a-0056 343.000000 344.139375 we've got
sw3051B-ms98-a-0057 344.139375 351.562750 three different levels of decking because this lot slopes way back down and and the house is built around the trees
sw3051B-ms98-a-0058 351.562750 359.956500 and with these deck[ing]- decking that a corporation and a large area for the trees to come up so it's real real shady but that's one of the few things
sw3051B-ms98-a-0059 359.956500 366.753125 that really uh immediately pays back on return but what i was going to tell you these Perry Homes back there
sw3051B-ms98-a-0060 366.753125 379.582375 when the people from MCI come down and they are you know they're used to the the Virginia area metropolitan DC my God they come down here and and those houses that that look like to them the colonial look like what the 
sw3051B-ms98-a-0061 379.582375 392.880000 right and the idea of ever owning anything that has four thousand square feet in it for less than two hundred twenty thousand dollars which is probably about what their equity is that they got out of selling their house those things are selling like hot cakes
sw3051B-ms98-a-0062 392.880000 404.547625 but one of the people that was living back there was telling me that there is his air conditioning bill per month last summer was in excess of five hundred dollars a month and i thought
sw3051B-ms98-a-0063 404.547625 417.620750 and he was talking he was talking about how you keep up with the utilities here and i was thinking well you know i know why your God damn bill is so high it's because there's not a there's no insulation insulation in those things
sw3051B-ms98-a-0064 417.620750 419.059625 yeah
sw3051B-ms98-a-0065 419.059625 420.566125 [silence]
sw3051B-ms98-a-0066 420.566125 429.608750 any yet you know [vocalized-noise] they they show very well uh they show very well unless you have you know lived in a lot of houses around here or
sw3051B-ms98-a-0067 429.608750 432.517500 or looked at a lot of houses around here
sw3051B-ms98-a-0068 432.517500 439.022000 and i think that makes a big difference but i like i like this area and everything that i've been saying says that it's
sw3051B-ms98-a-0069 439.022000 440.090250 [silence]
sw3051B-ms98-a-0070 440.090250 443.981750 if i i think if we had to sell now we could come close to breaking even 
sw3051B-ms98-a-0071 443.981750 447.797500 [silence]
sw3051B-ms98-a-0072 447.797500 449.740875 uh you're in you're in the
