sw3047A-ms98-a-0024 83.946250 87.630500 what's the criterion for choosing to go there
sw3047A-ms98-a-0025 87.630500 101.501750 uh well at the time i was uh thinking of going premed and in the state uh they had the best premed uh curriculum for the
sw3047A-ms98-a-0026 101.501750 114.997125 uh state institutions it was a choice between there and uh a private college that uh was a bit more expensive at the time we really could not afford it so

sw3047A-ms98-a-0038 145.538125 147.579625 kind of difficult sometimes too
sw3047A-ms98-a-0039 147.579625 149.859375 especially if you have not been away a lot

sw3047A-ms98-a-0053 187.981750 198.005750 but uh so when you are first going to school that you kind of have the luxury of being able to have some latitude in choosing the place to go

sw3047A-ms98-a-0083 328.447625 329.599875 [silence]
sw3047A-ms98-a-0084 329.599875 340.953375 oh alumnae recruiting uh here in town uh recently uh well last year uh and it was kind of fun because you are trying to
sw3047A-ms98-a-0085 340.953375 350.597125 to trying to get people interested in your school you know and they were they this was a college night at a at a high school in Richardson and it was and there were a bunch of
sw3047A-ms98-a-0086 350.597125 360.878250 kids you know and a bunch of schools there were a hundred schools probably there all competing for the same kids [vocalized-noise] it's kind of interesting [vocalized-noise] to
sw3047A-ms98-a-0087 360.878250 373.022375 to to talk up you know your school and i was surprised by the number of kids that came came by and had heard of you know our school and and were interested in it and
sw3047A-ms98-a-0088 373.022375 384.339750 uh you know we uh you you situations like that you don't realize you know until you start thinking about it the kinds of advantages you school may have over others you
sw3047A-ms98-a-0089 384.339750 389.696375 and so i i was real real pleased with that that worked out so well
sw3047A-ms98-a-0090 389.696375 393.014500 [silence]
sw3047A-ms98-a-0091 393.014500 397.209750 i think so i don't know offhand but uh it seemed like there were quite a few
sw3047A-ms98-a-0092 397.209750 400.295125 kids that were definitely interested in going there
sw3047A-ms98-a-0093 400.295125 412.205500 so there there was one mother who uh came by right even before we started who who obviously was uh very interested in getting her her her daughter in or or
sw3047A-ms98-a-0094 412.205500 419.939250 having gotten her daughter in or something and she was wanting some more information but she was [vocalized-noise] her her daughter was uh

sw3047A-ms98-a-0097 439.318625 445.785875 had these business cards she was passing out and it was [noise] quite a production uh [laughter] i think some parents go a little bit overboard
