sw3032A-ms98-a-0019 140.767625 149.244750 it's the rank and file they never talk about cutting at the top you know the administrators and the assistant to the assistant to the assistant
sw3032A-ms98-a-0020 149.244750 156.156625 and i think the federal government is the same way that it's it's just gotten so huge that i don't think anyone

sw3032A-ms98-a-0037 215.273125 224.206375 um maybe they can look at it and they can you know each one of them that's in there now have got their own favorite projects and all you know they're they're cronies and
sw3032A-ms98-a-0038 224.206375 233.855875 [noise] um but i don't think you can do anything i don't think they're i think the budget's out of hand until you can get in there and change the administration and i'm talking about right through from top to bottom

sw3032A-ms98-a-0050 289.135125 300.336125 uh l[aying]- laying off a lot of people you know cutt[ing]- cutting a lot of services um the state is not funding any of the any of the cities and towns so
sw3032A-ms98-a-0051 300.336125 308.327250 so the cities and towns now are are forced to go out and uh raise capital uh it's it's uh
sw3032A-ms98-a-0052 308.327250 314.685875 it's just a bad situation and it's not only there but Rhode Island is the same it's just isn't there you know it's in the same boat

sw3032A-ms98-a-0055 356.265250 364.169500 uh i think they should probably go back and borrow some of uh Roosevelt's ideas you know uh set up some of these CCC camps like they had way back
sw3032A-ms98-a-0056 364.169500 366.186500 um that

sw3032A-ms98-a-0058 379.597500 391.765875 that's right they could they could uh they could build roads uh bridges uh uh canals uh there's there's a ton of things they can do we can take in uh they could stop start uh a rapid transit
sw3032A-ms98-a-0059 391.765875 395.286500 movement like when they when they first broke into uh
sw3032A-ms98-a-0060 395.286500 397.502125 [noise] uh the interstate highways
