sw3032B-ms98-a-0004 5.589750 9.637875 well on the budget i'm not for sure i wouldn't um
sw3032B-ms98-a-0005 9.637875 13.543375 start off first of all by putting a limit on the
sw3032B-ms98-a-0006 13.543375 15.637375 members of congress
sw3032B-ms98-a-0007 15.637375 18.831875 and then maybe we could get some new people in there to work on it
sw3032B-ms98-a-0008 18.831875 22.606250 but other than the budget i think they just have to uh
sw3032B-ms98-a-0009 22.606250 23.652625 [silence]
sw3032B-ms98-a-0010 23.652625 27.384500 i don't know i think they have to just have uh maybe um
sw3032B-ms98-a-0011 27.384500 33.252875 uh almost a like a constitutional convention and get sharp people from all over the country to come together
sw3032B-ms98-a-0012 33.252875 37.404750 try to decide what we're going to cut i think we cut the wrong areas and
sw3032B-ms98-a-0013 37.404750 39.911250 and just maybe start all over again
sw3032B-ms98-a-0014 39.911250 41.089875 [silence]
sw3032B-ms98-a-0015 41.089875 44.793625 almost like family sometimes i have to do this call time out and then

sw3032B-ms98-a-0021 63.776500 74.379750 see down here in Texas they just they don't s[tate]- they we don't have a state income tax and so they never want to raise taxes so they just raise the fees they just call them fees and there's a fee for everything
sw3032B-ms98-a-0022 74.379750 75.419375 [silence]
sw3032B-ms98-a-0023 75.419375 81.271750 we don't have a state income tax and uh there's no uh the sales tax isn't on food
sw3032B-ms98-a-0024 81.271750 84.286875 or anything like that so we
sw3032B-ms98-a-0025 84.286875 89.884750 yeah so we're not taxed very much uh but the fees are p[retty]- pretty ridiculous
sw3032B-ms98-a-0026 89.884750 95.267625 but i think we just may need to have uh you know get sharp people from all over the country
sw3032B-ms98-a-0027 95.267625 105.371125 into some sort of a like a constitutional convention and then to say what's working in one place why wouldn't it work someplace else i noticed Bridgeport Connecticut's declared bankruptcy

sw3032B-ms98-a-0044 165.519500 172.440250 so somebody has to get it to where that it's just a rank and file citizens around the country and and the and like a
sw3032B-ms98-a-0045 172.440250 175.673250 like a huge convention you know if they'd send uh
sw3032B-ms98-a-0046 175.673250 185.822875 so many people from each uh um they could do them_1 they could do them_1 in the state by state and then each state could pick representatives just like they do at uh political conventions
