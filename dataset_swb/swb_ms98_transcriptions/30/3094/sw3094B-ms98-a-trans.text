sw3094B-ms98-a-0058 334.320375 346.910625 well i- i don't know that it's showing anymore i thought i saw it show once or twice i saw the first one you know because i was interested in seeing what it looked like and it wasn't really that good i mean you know the muppet stuff was really was was okay but uh
sw3094B-ms98-a-0059 346.910625 359.452750 the comedy on it wasn't wasn't very very funny or anything and uh i think it might have been cut [laughter-already] because uh the same with you i haven't really paid attention but i hadn't seen it you know just glancing through the TV Guide or whatever 
sw3094B-ms98-a-0060 359.452750 365.016500 so it might've been cut and uh i thought that was surprising being a new show and i'm sure it cost a lot of money to make
