sw3094A-ms98-a-0003 3.987625 16.480875 well i- i tend to be a a uh sports news and uh not very many of the modern sitcoms
sw3094A-ms98-a-0004 16.480875 17.619250 [silence]
sw3094A-ms98-a-0005 17.619250 19.614000 what a[bout]- what about yourself
sw3094A-ms98-a-0006 19.614000 31.858625 [silence]
sw3094A-ms98-a-0007 31.858625 32.962875 yes [laughter]

sw3094A-ms98-a-0011 69.257625 81.155500 well what i find is that outside of uh well sports because i'm a sports fan is the the ones that i do watch is uh Saturday Night Live
sw3094A-ms98-a-0012 81.155500 85.369875 except i- i wish they didn't have so many reruns [laughter]
sw3094A-ms98-a-0013 85.369875 96.489375 and otherwise we're caught up with uh because we are pretty good at sitting down to dinner in the six to seven o'clock period uh good ole Wheel of Fortune
sw3094A-ms98-a-0014 96.489375 102.971875 which is uh an interesting combination of a a lot of luck and uh
sw3094A-ms98-a-0015 102.971875 110.877250 the it's probably as good a program as any for the audience to play along and see if you think you're smart or smarter then then those folks are
sw3094A-ms98-a-0016 110.877250 111.924250 [silence]
sw3094A-ms98-a-0017 111.924250 126.461125 uh i have a family that is very much into sitcoms and and i have to at six o'clock uh fight getting the news on versus uh having the channel changed on me because they want to watch Cosby or one of the other ones that
sw3094A-ms98-a-0018 126.461125 130.971500 running on one of the uh the off channels
sw3094A-ms98-a-0019 130.971500 141.522500 [silence]
sw3094A-ms98-a-0020 141.522500 142.735375 um-hum

sw3094A-ms98-a-0022 145.470000 146.485125 yeah
sw3094A-ms98-a-0023 146.485125 147.674500 [silence]
sw3094A-ms98-a-0024 147.674500 150.351000 certainly more educational than Wheel of Fortune
sw3094A-ms98-a-0025 150.351000 151.192500 [laughter]
sw3094A-ms98-a-0026 151.192500 158.321875 [silence]

sw3094A-ms98-a-0033 190.960750 205.054750 yeah i find that it seems to me and uh maybe this is as you get older i'm in my mid forties now but uh uh i guess from my vantage point i think the quality of TV has gone down or else my interests have changed because there were
sw3094A-ms98-a-0034 205.054750 213.485625 there were various series over the years that i would always make sure i watched and yet i find that now i'm
sw3094A-ms98-a-0035 213.485625 225.829250 there's hardly anything that that except Saturday Night Live that draws me to say i want to try to watch that i may watch something just because it's on but i uh
sw3094A-ms98-a-0036 225.829250 237.039250 i tend to go more to the educational channels if there's uh something that seems interesting there i just uh as i say don't find the modern sitcom very uh
sw3094A-ms98-a-0037 237.039250 240.252125 well just very appealing to my interests
sw3094A-ms98-a-0038 240.252125 245.070375 [silence]
sw3094A-ms98-a-0039 245.070375 246.124750 yeah
sw3094A-ms98-a-0040 246.124750 247.438875 [silence]
sw3094A-ms98-a-0041 247.438875 249.096250 yeah do you get A&E
sw3094A-ms98-a-0042 249.096250 250.225375 [silence]
sw3094A-ms98-a-0043 250.225375 253.349500 because that's one [vocalized-noise] we don't have cable so
sw3094A-ms98-a-0044 253.349500 260.107625 uh there's a few things i miss because_1 i don't have cable and A&E is one whenever i'm on a business trip
sw3094A-ms98-a-0045 260.107625 269.266000 and they have it i find that it has things that are uh that interest me they have a lot of series uh i guess i'm into uh
sw3094A-ms98-a-0046 269.266000 279.688875 i'm a history buff so with all their reruns of uh the aviators over the ages and uh who built what planes and all that was uh
sw3094A-ms98-a-0047 279.688875 282.044250 that type of stuff interests me
sw3094A-ms98-a-0048 282.044250 289.337125 [silence]
sw3094A-ms98-a-0049 289.337125 290.327250 hum
sw3094A-ms98-a-0050 290.327250 299.255500 [silence]
sw3094A-ms98-a-0051 299.255500 304.420250 yeah i guess that varies from place to place being in the Dallas area because we have
sw3094A-ms98-a-0052 304.420250 312.881750 we have about seven without uh cable and then with cable who knows how many you can get
sw3094A-ms98-a-0053 312.881750 315.243125 seven seems enough [laughter]
sw3094A-ms98-a-0054 315.243125 322.700875 [silence]
sw3094A-ms98-a-0055 322.700875 334.756750 uh i've read a little bit about it but uh i haven't i don't even know if it's running here in Dallas It kind of shows the level of interest i have in looking at the TV schedule what time's it on there
sw3094A-ms98-a-0056 334.756750 338.856750 [silence]

sw3094A-ms98-a-0063 364.871875 371.710250 well they do but i[t]- it's amazing these days if something isn't making it the word of mouth uh
sw3094A-ms98-a-0064 371.710250 383.005250 of people talking to each other can cause a program which gets bad reviews to uh to uh not last for very long and even though they did invest money in it
sw3094A-ms98-a-0065 383.005250 393.384875 that they uh it's i think the comparison is like baseball managers this year they seem to uh say two weeks in uh you've had your chance time to uh [laughter]
sw3094A-ms98-a-0066 393.384875 396.432375 since you aren't making it we're going to find somebody else
sw3094A-ms98-a-0067 396.432375 402.974500 [silence]
sw3094A-ms98-a-0068 402.974500 411.610500 well you know LA Law seems to be real hot and in fact because of the particular business i'm in i'm not a lawyer but i work with lawyers a lot
sw3094A-ms98-a-0069 411.610500 420.729750 and the lawyers seem to be very much into watching it and uh yet i again i have to say because of uh 
sw3094A-ms98-a-0070 420.729750 426.004750 uh i have not watched very many episodes of it
sw3094A-ms98-a-0071 426.004750 428.058375 uh again it's
sw3094A-ms98-a-0072 428.058375 434.316625 i don't know what i do with my time but i certainly don't spend it watching uh TV in the evenings
