sw3037B-ms98-a-0002 0.393000 3.313250 [silence]
sw3037B-ms98-a-0003 3.313250 13.238500 well i guess [vocalized-noise] uh i really don't have a lot of contact with uh with the business world i'm self employed work in a one person office
sw3037B-ms98-a-0004 13.238500 20.904125 and so m[y]- m[y]- my my contacts with the with the drug testing possibilities are pretty limited uh
sw3037B-ms98-a-0005 20.904125 23.149750 [silence]
sw3037B-ms98-a-0006 23.149750 24.988500 well i
sw3037B-ms98-a-0007 24.988500 32.445250 i- i you know i understand why companies can [vocalized-noise] in some cases would feel a need
sw3037B-ms98-a-0008 32.445250 39.293000 uh i have some reservations about it because i- i do believe that i believe in individual rights
sw3037B-ms98-a-0009 39.293000 49.150500 and and i think that uh that that does at least borderline on an invasion of privacy or you know or violation of you know personal rights
sw3037B-ms98-a-0010 49.150500 58.139250 [silence]
sw3037B-ms98-a-0011 58.139250 62.605375 yeah well i guess i'd i'm uh i'm not sure that uh
sw3037B-ms98-a-0012 62.605375 63.625500 [vocalized-noise]
sw3037B-ms98-a-0013 63.625500 67.883750 [vocalized-noise] uh you know you'd have to prove somehow
sw3037B-ms98-a-0014 67.883750 73.278250 show that there's a reason for you know for suspecting that person
sw3037B-ms98-a-0015 73.278250 86.004500 as you know as being a drug user or you know whatever and i mean you wouldn't uh you wouldn't you're not allowed a company's not allowed anymore to give uh uh
sw3037B-ms98-a-0016 86.004500 87.541500 what is it uh
sw3037B-ms98-a-0017 87.541500 88.763000 [silence]
sw3037B-ms98-a-0018 88.763000 92.707750 the no the the test uh now i've drawn a blank
sw3037B-ms98-a-0019 92.707750 94.650000 [silence]
sw3037B-ms98-a-0020 94.650000 96.296875 polygraph test
sw3037B-ms98-a-0021 96.296875 107.468000 yeah you're not allowed to use polygraph test in pre screening you know for employees anymore uh so you know you don't have any any proof or any way to check on a person as to their honesty
sw3037B-ms98-a-0022 107.468000 109.101250 uh
sw3037B-ms98-a-0023 109.101250 117.504125 the only way that you you know the only alternative you have if you sus[pect]- suspect a person is uh is stealing from you is to get evidence
sw3037B-ms98-a-0024 117.504125 120.931375 uh to that effect you know and i kind of feel like uh
sw3037B-ms98-a-0025 120.931375 130.708500 drug testing should fall into that into that same category or potentially anyway that if you suspect it that you should have some kind of proof not
sw3037B-ms98-a-0026 130.708500 140.023250 not come up with a method to to have the employee [laughter-furnish] [laughter-the] furnish the proof against themselves you know in effect you know that's that's kind of uh
sw3037B-ms98-a-0027 140.023250 147.324875 of [vocalized-noise] defeating some of the purposes i think of the Constitution which you know which says you know you don't have to give
sw3037B-ms98-a-0028 147.324875 156.198000 self incriminating evidence course we're talking about you know criminal cases in that in that case but i still i think it still fits you know the same uh
sw3037B-ms98-a-0029 156.198000 159.495125 somewhat anyway the the same area
sw3037B-ms98-a-0030 159.495125 174.971125 [silence]
sw3037B-ms98-a-0031 174.971125 176.299875 um-hum
sw3037B-ms98-a-0032 176.299875 216.709125 [silence]
sw3037B-ms98-a-0033 216.709125 217.570500 well
sw3037B-ms98-a-0034 217.570500 233.777750 [silence]
sw3037B-ms98-a-0035 233.777750 243.849250 um-hum [noise] yeah there's not uh from my from my own personal uh knowledge not experience but knowledge
sw3037B-ms98-a-0036 243.849250 249.184875 uh there are i would say there are as many women drug users
sw3037B-ms98-a-0037 249.184875 255.555250 as there are men uh in most you know most of the cases that i know of you know
sw3037B-ms98-a-0038 255.555250 256.718000 from
sw3037B-ms98-a-0039 256.718000 260.297000 personal conversations uh
sw3037B-ms98-a-0040 260.297000 266.206625 [silence]
sw3037B-ms98-a-0041 266.206625 278.149625 yeah well i've known people in the in the past that have you know that uh and in in almost all of those cases it was you know husband and wife or boyfriend girlfriend or
sw3037B-ms98-a-0042 278.149625 280.550375 you know that kind of a situation
sw3037B-ms98-a-0043 280.550375 288.891000 do what a casual user uh yeah pretty much uh right so[cial]- social users say uh
sw3037B-ms98-a-0044 288.891000 291.964750 and and and in in you know in some cases it would be
sw3037B-ms98-a-0045 291.964750 303.768375 uh a group of friends that you know that i would know about that you know i'm not a drug user i have not ever been and will not ever be but i you know i've known people that have talked about it you know and uh
sw3037B-ms98-a-0046 303.768375 307.985375 and it was you know it was couples and groups and
sw3037B-ms98-a-0047 307.985375 310.393875 you know male and female and
sw3037B-ms98-a-0048 310.393875 312.690000 you know it was not limited to
sw3037B-ms98-a-0049 312.690000 313.624750 [vocalized-noise]
sw3037B-ms98-a-0050 313.624750 323.330625 [silence]
sw3037B-ms98-a-0051 323.330625 324.619500 right
sw3037B-ms98-a-0052 324.619500 328.984375 [silence]
sw3037B-ms98-a-0053 328.984375 330.397625 [laughter-right]
sw3037B-ms98-a-0054 330.397625 340.417625 yeah so but yeah i- i understand the [vocalized-noise] you know the idea i'm i'm all in favor of getting drugs out of the you know out of the the system completely 
sw3037B-ms98-a-0055 340.417625 341.545125 [silence]
sw3037B-ms98-a-0056 341.545125 349.804875 yeah right but uh you know i- i think that uh i think that the companies that that have started
sw3037B-ms98-a-0057 349.804875 359.668250 the the the non voluntary drug testing and and Texas Instruments in particular or is you know is one that i know of anyway
sw3037B-ms98-a-0058 359.668250 361.022375 they uh
sw3037B-ms98-a-0059 361.022375 374.116250 i think they're asking for for the Constitution to be interpreted to say hey you can't do this it's you know it's a viol[ation]- from my point of view it's a violation of you know of of [vocalized-noise] a person 
sw3037B-ms98-a-0060 374.116250 380.374125 [silence]
sw3037B-ms98-a-0061 380.374125 386.614000 uh not a rule against it but a a a non voluntary testing for it
sw3037B-ms98-a-0062 386.614000 399.478625 is i think that's you know it's it's like you're telling if they're telling a person you don't have any alternative but to uh a[ccept]- uh accept this test [noise] go through this testing
sw3037B-ms98-a-0063 399.478625 412.414875 [silence]
sw3037B-ms98-a-0064 412.414875 415.561875 well [vocalized-noise] yeah
sw3037B-ms98-a-0065 415.561875 422.866750 you know in TI's under TI's current policy uh new hire new employees are tested
sw3037B-ms98-a-0066 422.866750 431.421625 and you know so it's it is a part of the you know it's a part of the test a part of the part of the employment employing procedure now is is to test
sw3037B-ms98-a-0067 431.421625 434.711500 and and there's there's no problem with
sw3037B-ms98-a-0068 434.711500 442.946625 you know with pre employment testing that i guess that's a little a little unusual that they can test test for drugs but they can't test for honesty
sw3037B-ms98-a-0069 442.946625 444.698750 and uh
sw3037B-ms98-a-0070 444.698750 449.821375 you know so that's uh but that is you know that is a a
