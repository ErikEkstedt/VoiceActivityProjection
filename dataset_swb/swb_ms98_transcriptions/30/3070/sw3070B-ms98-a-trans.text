sw3070B-ms98-a-0051 255.524000 269.673875 organize the you know who is going to see to it that the coffee pot gets there who's going to rent the tables who's going to see to it that the silverware gets turned back to the caterer uh and each year it's done a little bit differently because different people serve in those roles
sw3070B-ms98-a-0052 269.673875 280.445000 we have a biographer who who continues every year to save clippings on any family member and they're entered into a a wonderful uh scrap book
sw3070B-ms98-a-0053 280.445000 294.159750 and pictures of new babies and new people who have been added and and obituaries to those who are gone And it keeps the family alive even you know even though it's very fluid and they're very dedicated to that
sw3070B-ms98-a-0054 294.159750 298.103625 and uh it's been really wonderful it helps you hang on to your roots
sw3070B-ms98-a-0055 298.103625 308.440250 and it helps you feel a strong sense of belonging my husband on the other hand was not very close to his family his family was very scattered and very diverse
sw3070B-ms98-a-0056 308.440250 317.081125 and i asked him i got to talking to him i said well how is his nephew doing well i don't know i haven't talked to my brother in three years i said well how's your brother doing i don't know
sw3070B-ms98-a-0057 317.081125 325.591625 um you know my son keeps in touch with him i think but i don't i said hey wouldn't you like to know what's happening with these people yeah but i'm you know it's too much trouble
sw3070B-ms98-a-0058 325.591625 336.061750 so i got busy got together and put a reunion together for his family and succeeded in getting all of his brothers and sisters and all of their offspring but one
sw3070B-ms98-a-0059 336.061750 345.302375 to our place down at Lake Tawakoni liked to kill me because i ha[d]- it was i didn't have that group cooperation i did it by myself
sw3070B-ms98-a-0060 345.302375 355.263750 and uh nobody brought covered dishes we had a great big fish fry and you know i fixed a salad in a number three tub and [laughter] and uh
sw3070B-ms98-a-0061 355.263750 364.813375 it was an enormous task to bring all of those people together with just one or two people helping and uh we had to provide sleeping arrangements for all of them and i told him
sw3070B-ms98-a-0062 364.813375 366.620500 [silence]
sw3070B-ms98-a-0063 366.620500 378.802000 we did it that year and then the following summer we did not have all of the family there we sent invitations we said please let us know if you're coming it was when uh his mother his
sw3070B-ms98-a-0064 378.802000 389.218625 step father had died the year before and it his mother was alone and so they came to support her and then one by one his broth[ers]- you know his sisters he began to lose family members
sw3070B-ms98-a-0065 389.218625 394.705250 and it was difficult to hold them together and then of course he died two years ago so
sw3070B-ms98-a-0066 394.705250 398.420500 you know that family has gone down to one brother and one sister now
sw3070B-ms98-a-0067 398.420500 404.124000 and uh it i think that's what happens when they get scattered the the family unit
sw3070B-ms98-a-0068 404.124000 406.508750 you know falls into disrepair
sw3070B-ms98-a-0069 406.508750 412.878500 [silence]
