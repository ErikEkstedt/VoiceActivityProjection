sw3070A-ms98-a-0049 172.520750 186.903375 that's good well i had a professor in anthropology at school who studied family reunions so i learned a lot about them i haven't been to a lot but we talked a lot about the the rituals she uh equated the family reunion with the Protestant
sw3070A-ms98-a-0050 186.903375 193.809000 it was the Protestant version of the Catholic pilgrimage it was it was an interesting theory she talked about the um
sw3070A-ms98-a-0051 193.809000 206.048500 that Catholics all it's a home centered you know it's all family centered anyway so you usually are living where your parents live and it's all your you don't have to come home so the Catholics would make a pilgrimage in older Europe
sw3070A-ms98-a-0052 206.048500 215.088750 but when the Protestant ethic happened in America there were people who ever went out and you know went away from the family to seek their fortune and then had to come back home
sw3070A-ms98-a-0053 215.088750 218.381125 for the reunion so that became their version of the pilgrimage
sw3070A-ms98-a-0054 218.381125 230.977625 but she had it was interesting you know i [laughter] don't know how valid it is but she talked about that and how the the big picnic table was the symbolic communion of the people gathering together and
sw3070A-ms98-a-0055 230.977625 237.346875 um you know about the bread and the ritual placement do you have a a certain way that everything's
sw3070A-ms98-a-0056 237.346875 243.922250 placed out on the table every every year is there kind of a you know salads go first and things like that
