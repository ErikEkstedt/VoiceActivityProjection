sw3079B-ms98-a-0039 158.721500 164.049125 that's a good idea when we have some money we'll do that [laughter]

sw3079B-ms98-a-0047 189.967875 198.897125 [noise] well some that's th[ere]- there're several things i do to save money um one is to use garage sales
sw3079B-ms98-a-0048 198.897125 200.679000 and we do a lot
sw3079B-ms98-a-0049 200.679000 201.446000 [noise]
sw3079B-ms98-a-0050 201.446000 203.610875 get a lot of things used
sw3079B-ms98-a-0051 203.610875 217.969750 and the things that we do have i try and recycle a lot you know before i'll get rid of something i'll look at it and think what else can i do with this and uh how else can i use this
sw3079B-ms98-a-0052 217.969750 222.386625 to solve some other problem somewhere else you know
sw3079B-ms98-a-0053 222.386625 227.255125 and uh that has helped a lot um
sw3079B-ms98-a-0054 227.255125 232.894625 and i do shop the sales and buy more than what we need
sw3079B-ms98-a-0055 232.894625 240.950250 so that i've got it ahead of time and i don't have to go out and buy it something not on sale because i've already gotten it on sale
sw3079B-ms98-a-0056 240.950250 243.755000 then when the sale comes around again
sw3079B-ms98-a-0057 243.755000 247.226250 go ahead and stock up again
sw3079B-ms98-a-0058 247.226250 249.061125 um
sw3079B-ms98-a-0059 249.061125 256.079875 [silence]
sw3079B-ms98-a-0060 256.079875 262.449750 Sam's um we have a Sam's not too far away but i haven't uh used it yet
sw3079B-ms98-a-0061 262.449750 266.470625 uh they're going to they're building a new one that's going to be even closer
sw3079B-ms98-a-0062 266.470625 272.582750 and i'm i'll probably use it when it's over here even a little closer
sw3079B-ms98-a-0063 272.582750 275.847875 [silence]
sw3079B-ms98-a-0064 275.847875 279.468500 yeah you have to buy quantity
sw3079B-ms98-a-0065 279.468500 280.643250 [silence]
sw3079B-ms98-a-0066 280.643250 284.607750 but um that's how you save money you know

sw3079B-ms98-a-0074 317.996000 323.627750 yeah well i think there's an awful lot of things that we spend money on that we really don't need
sw3079B-ms98-a-0075 323.627750 332.878000 and i think since being unemployed we [vocalized-noise] look you look at things more carefully you know do i really need this or is it just something i want 
sw3079B-ms98-a-0076 332.878000 335.734625 and uh you have to 
sw3079B-ms98-a-0077 335.734625 345.542500 decide how much you want and and i think uh uh i've noticed that however much money you have you can spend that much 
sw3079B-ms98-a-0078 345.542500 354.975750 or more you know people people will go beyond what they have no matter what they have if they use credit cards that's one thing we're trying
sw3079B-ms98-a-0079 354.975750 359.812500 try not to do is to use the credit cards because that just runs
sw3079B-ms98-a-0080 359.812500 369.230250 yeah yeah if you [vocalized-noise] and i really like paying cash instead of checks even um 
sw3079B-ms98-a-0081 369.230250 370.868250 [silence]
sw3079B-ms98-a-0082 370.868250 374.886250 we got changed to an economy account at the
sw3079B-ms98-a-0083 374.886250 380.604500 credit union so it costs less to use less checks
sw3079B-ms98-a-0084 380.604500 382.414125 [noise] and um 
sw3079B-ms98-a-0085 382.414125 383.425875 [silence]
sw3079B-ms98-a-0086 383.425875 386.318875 those are just little things you can do
sw3079B-ms98-a-0087 386.318875 397.961250 [silence]
sw3079B-ms98-a-0088 397.961250 399.632125 [noise] yeah 
sw3079B-ms98-a-0089 399.632125 401.361750 i uh
sw3079B-ms98-a-0090 401.361750 403.794750 having a garage sale yourself helps
sw3079B-ms98-a-0091 403.794750 404.575875 [laughter]
sw3079B-ms98-a-0092 404.575875 406.758000 we just had one this last week [laughter-end] 
sw3079B-ms98-a-0093 406.758000 408.123625 yeah

sw3079B-ms98-a-0102 432.500250 440.966250 i think uh learning how to do things yourself a lot helps too like i cut everybody's hair myself
sw3079B-ms98-a-0103 440.966250 447.157500 and if you can uh just watch how they do it at the
