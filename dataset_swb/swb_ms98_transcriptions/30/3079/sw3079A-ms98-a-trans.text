sw3079A-ms98-a-0009 31.111000 32.331375 uh-huh
sw3079A-ms98-a-0010 32.331375 44.593000 [silence]
sw3079A-ms98-a-0011 44.593000 45.779375 yeah
sw3079A-ms98-a-0012 45.779375 47.013375 [silence]
sw3079A-ms98-a-0013 47.013375 48.212875 right
sw3079A-ms98-a-0014 48.212875 52.307250 [silence]
sw3079A-ms98-a-0015 52.307250 58.006000 yeah sure what we uh what we try to do is of course you have to pay your your necessities first right
sw3079A-ms98-a-0016 58.006000 68.562250 and uh you know your rent and whatever else and uh and then after that we always put away some money for savings no matter how much it is uh you know how little or or whatever you know 
sw3079A-ms98-a-0017 68.562250 75.495375 and uh and then after that then we have then our our you know spending money or whatever for for miscellaneous things 
sw3079A-ms98-a-0018 75.495375 82.922500 but one thing that we've used and it's it's it's kind of good because i[t]- g[ives]- it gives you uh kind of a savings plan sort of 
sw3079A-ms98-a-0019 82.922500 89.871500 and uh what it is we have a ledger you know just a a book and in it in it we have different accounts
sw3079A-ms98-a-0020 89.871500 96.105875 uh that let's say i would save a hundred dollars a month or something that's what would go into savings for instance
sw3079A-ms98-a-0021 96.105875 103.361125 uh we have it so that in that ledger you know the bank just just has it as a hundred dollars going into savings 
sw3079A-ms98-a-0022 103.361125 109.319500 well what we do is we take that ledger and we take that hundred dollars and we break it down into different categories
sw3079A-ms98-a-0023 109.319500 118.368125 so for instance uh let's say twenty dollars would go to to the cars you know car repair uh maintenance or whatever another 
sw3079A-ms98-a-0024 118.368125 126.246500 right and another twenty dollars would go to our clothes another twenty dollars would go to uh you know kids toys or something you know
sw3079A-ms98-a-0025 126.246500 133.568500 and uh so that then when we want to spend money on clothes or have the car you know serviced or something like that then we just go to that
sw3079A-ms98-a-0026 133.568500 143.837000 you know that page on the ledger and say okay you know we have whatever saved like a hundred and twenty dollars saved for clothes so we can go spend you know whatever howe[ver]- you know [vocalized-noise] up to a hundred twenty dollars 
sw3079A-ms98-a-0027 143.837000 152.813500 y[eah]- yeah and that's how we kind of keep track of things so that when the car [vocalized-noise] you know when the car breaks down or something you you have some money at least you know earmarked for that
sw3079A-ms98-a-0028 152.813500 154.886250 and and it seems to work
sw3079A-ms98-a-0029 154.886250 157.779625 [silence]
sw3079A-ms98-a-0030 157.779625 159.606750 right right
sw3079A-ms98-a-0031 159.606750 162.003375 and so it you know it seems to 
sw3079A-ms98-a-0032 162.003375 163.094750 [laughter]
sw3079A-ms98-a-0033 163.094750 168.442625 it it seems to work pretty good you know the the only part is you got to keep track of it you know every every month of stuff 
sw3079A-ms98-a-0034 168.442625 174.275625 but that seems to work pretty good and uh see other things we do is just uh 
sw3079A-ms98-a-0035 174.275625 176.029375 just try to uh
sw3079A-ms98-a-0036 176.029375 180.527125 just try not to spend a whole lot you know with some things of course you have to you know
sw3079A-ms98-a-0037 180.527125 188.177375 and uh we try to you know make sure where we go and uh try to catch something on sale or or something like that

sw3079A-ms98-a-0067 302.170250 309.975625 and uh it's kind of really neat because it does a lot of things for you as far as [vocalized-noise] give you all your graphs and your charts and stuff and show you where you're spending money
