sw3085A-ms98-a-0021 89.627125 96.628875 yes yes that's that's an interesting point of view i uh you know seeing the children in the school the way i do i
sw3085A-ms98-a-0022 96.628875 110.178500 i mean i see the ones that we can always tell the ones that have not been around children at all when they come in as three year olds a[s]- as opposed to the ones that have been in the program that started at twelve months maybe and were were even in there one day a week 
sw3085A-ms98-a-0023 110.178500 117.160000 which is all our school provides for the you know for the under three year old but still they have an opp[ortunity]- an opportunity to be with other children 
sw3085A-ms98-a-0024 117.160000 122.607250 and it is true and uh i but i think that would but as far as looking for a place
sw3085A-ms98-a-0025 122.607250 134.202750 you know i i the criteria i mean i think it's very important to have very caring people you know to take care of the the in a school if you're going to have the structure and you're going to have the large numbers you're going to need really

sw3085A-ms98-a-0033 183.272875 189.128500 you know really having a lot of fun with the children and and providing them with a great atmosphere
