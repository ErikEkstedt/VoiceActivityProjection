sw3085B-ms98-a-0013 39.291125 47.428875 well i myself really feel like the structured day care program is more successful in today's environment
sw3085B-ms98-a-0014 47.428875 50.499125 than [vocalized-noise] the one on one care is 
sw3085B-ms98-a-0015 50.499125 63.843250 uh when my children were growing up i actually had them up and until they were in the preschool situation i had them in a in a home with a lady who kept two or three kids and i felt like that home environment was very important to them
sw3085B-ms98-a-0016 63.843250 67.435875 it was important to me and uh
sw3085B-ms98-a-0017 67.435875 77.089000 i feel like that they they had that one on one that's so necessary at that age however in today's environment
sw3085B-ms98-a-0018 77.089000 90.854750 it may be more critical to have the ability to interact in large groups simply because that's the way our young people are are dealt with they're dealt with in packages

sw3085B-ms98-a-0032 130.657500 133.200625 [silence]
sw3085B-ms98-a-0033 133.200625 142.951625 i recently stopped by McDonald's and i was sitting out in their little playground while my granddaughter was playing on the things and was visiting with another mother who was there with her children
sw3085B-ms98-a-0034 142.951625 154.642000 and she was telling me that she was given the opportunity to manage a day care center and of course she was she had just gotten her degree and she was so enthusiastic and she was excited about it and she was going to accomplish all of these things
sw3085B-ms98-a-0035 154.642000 164.624500 however uh when it came to hiring and staffing people who cared and who were willing to take care of those children and spend that kind of time the pay is minimal
sw3085B-ms98-a-0036 164.624500 171.414750 and it takes people with total and complete dedication who really don't want to make a living for themselves
sw3085B-ms98-a-0037 171.414750 174.083750 in order to be in that environment
sw3085B-ms98-a-0038 174.083750 175.179875 [silence]
sw3085B-ms98-a-0039 175.179875 177.427125 absolutely

sw3085B-ms98-a-0042 185.549875 196.435500 um-hum [noise] well they ask so much of those caretakers for the amount that that they they pay they are to be there ahead of time you know they're there early to receive the kids 
sw3085B-ms98-a-0043 196.435500 207.600875 that's right and then then they have to work until the shop until the place closes at six P M and then it's their responsibility to clean up and be prepared for the next day because_1 they don't have cleaning crews in most of those
sw3085B-ms98-a-0044 207.600875 219.157125 and uh she just had a terrible time keeping sincerely dedicated people simply because they could not live with a kind of hours and the salary uh and she
sw3085B-ms98-a-0045 219.157125 221.428875 um-hum um-hum

sw3085B-ms98-a-0052 234.848875 245.401375 well i know that when my youngsters were small now my older son was adopted so he went into child care at two weeks [noise] and uh my younger son went into child care at six weeks
sw3085B-ms98-a-0053 245.401375 252.081000 so they were in that environment actually up until they became uh
sw3085B-ms98-a-0054 252.081000 253.659875 [noise] seven and nine
sw3085B-ms98-a-0055 253.659875 262.127250 and at that point i said look they have been given the custodial care that they need and the after hours care has been as
sw3085B-ms98-a-0056 262.127250 274.176750 good a quality as i can provide for them however they're going out into the school environment now they're under a lot of other influences i need to be here for them i need to be involved in their school because i want to be the one
sw3085B-ms98-a-0057 274.176750 288.906625 who influences the way they develop so i quit working after my kids started to school and got involved in volunteer work in their private school so that i could help direct their their learning experiences and their development
sw3085B-ms98-a-0058 288.906625 297.144625 [noise] i- i felt like that anybody who cared and loved the kids could change their diapers and feed them and bathe them
sw3085B-ms98-a-0059 297.144625 303.318875 and hold them but when time came to direct their ability to make choices
sw3085B-ms98-a-0060 303.318875 311.312500 to develop the kinds of things that that they're going to need to interact with other people i felt like i needed some strong influence there [noise]
sw3085B-ms98-a-0061 311.312500 313.148875 so i di[d]-
sw3085B-ms98-a-0062 313.148875 315.157750 i know
sw3085B-ms98-a-0063 315.157750 318.556500 that's right once they get up in sch[ool]- um-hum
sw3085B-ms98-a-0064 318.556500 320.501000 um-hum um-hum [noise]
sw3085B-ms98-a-0065 320.501000 328.065625 well i just felt very strongly about that and i- i did not work as a matter of fact my son was in the second grade and when he started
sw3085B-ms98-a-0066 328.065625 332.539875 uh at Skyline High School i asked him son when uh
sw3085B-ms98-a-0067 332.539875 343.342250 you know where do i go to sign up for the PTA and he said mom don't do that to me please don't do that to me so i knew it was time to go back to work but i feel very good about spending those years with my boys
sw3085B-ms98-a-0068 343.342250 357.467750 [noise] uh and i was just really grateful i only had one bad child care experience it was in a home uh the care taker that they had had since they were infants just could not do it she was from um [noise] uh
sw3085B-ms98-a-0069 357.467750 366.581625 uh Argentina and she was going back home and i couldn't just you know wait for eight three or four months and then bring them back to her so i had to find a new place
sw3085B-ms98-a-0070 366.581625 375.038125 and i put them in this home the kids cried when i took them the kids cried wh[en]- i could hear the kids crying when i went to pick them_1 up they were always cranky and irritable
sw3085B-ms98-a-0071 375.038125 383.908875 so i just took off and went there one day and uh the children were left unattended in a room you know they they were not well cared for
sw3085B-ms98-a-0072 383.908875 396.624000 and uh so it didn't take me long to take them out of that place but that's the only bad experience i had the rest of the time they stayed in La Petite Academy and i was very pleased with their development and their progress
sw3085B-ms98-a-0073 396.624000 405.504625 they learned a lot of things in those public environments that you just as soon they didn't learn but they're going to learn it sometime so but for the most part they did have good care
sw3085B-ms98-a-0074 405.504625 409.022125 and it did appear to me that the people who cared for them
sw3085B-ms98-a-0075 409.022125 415.283000 had a good concern for them and in one particular case they had a summer program where they were to be taken to the Y and taught to swim
sw3085B-ms98-a-0076 415.283000 423.876625 which just pleased me to death because i've always been ha[ve]- you know been afraid of the water however my uh older son came home and he said mom i don't like that man 
sw3085B-ms98-a-0077 423.876625 430.567125 said he took me by the head and dunked my head under the water and told me i had to get my face wet or i'd never swim
sw3085B-ms98-a-0078 430.567125 434.435250 boy it didn't take me very long to hot foot it over to the school
sw3085B-ms98-a-0079 434.435250 441.748250 and relay that to them and she said well she said you know kids do exaggerate but she said let's go ahead and send him another day
sw3085B-ms98-a-0080 441.748250 446.778375 or two days and i promise you faithfully i will watch the instructor every minute
sw3085B-ms98-a-0081 446.778375 449.097750 and see exactly what's happening
