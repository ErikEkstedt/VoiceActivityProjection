sw3082B-ms98-a-0036 121.828625 129.659750 [noise] and i often feel funny because i'm in a branch that's all but died i just have one aunt and my family
sw3082B-ms98-a-0037 129.659750 138.236250 so sometimes when these other families get together they're really pulling in aunts and uncles and grandkids and we're kind of off on the sidelines
sw3082B-ms98-a-0038 138.236250 145.326500 but it does remind us that we have family and roots so we keep going even though we're not a real big part of it

sw3082B-ms98-a-0057 218.690500 229.370000 oh it would be more yeah yeah that that is a problem with the distance the the people that we have that don't come are out El Paso way and it's just too much for all of them 
sw3082B-ms98-a-0058 229.370000 231.924500 all of that group to travel right
sw3082B-ms98-a-0059 231.924500 239.751500 but then we have the same attitude when it's out there although this year we're going out they're going to have it at Fort Davis and we thought that would be
sw3082B-ms98-a-0060 239.751500 244.236500 fun to kind of tie it in as a vacation time as well as reunion
