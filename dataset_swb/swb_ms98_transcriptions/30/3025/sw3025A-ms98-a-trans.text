sw3025A-ms98-a-0013 43.786375 47.188000 um-hum well that's about the way i prepare most fish
sw3025A-ms98-a-0014 47.188000 52.270125 uh i made scallops the other night that was unusual and uh
sw3025A-ms98-a-0015 52.270125 56.249125 basically uh i found a recipe to to make it in the microwave
sw3025A-ms98-a-0016 56.249125 61.455000 and you sprinkled the you you swished around a little melted butter and do uh
sw3025A-ms98-a-0017 61.455000 64.621625 oh i do not know micro[wave]- microwaved them for about
sw3025A-ms98-a-0018 64.621625 73.714250 nine minutes no no four four and a half five minutes and you had to add sesame seeds and bread crumbs on top very simple but very nice
sw3025A-ms98-a-0019 73.714250 77.573750 so if you are looking for a fish recipe that was good

sw3025A-ms98-a-0021 79.480000 81.388500 sesame seeds and bread crumbs
sw3025A-ms98-a-0022 81.388500 84.196375 and uh my husband liked it
sw3025A-ms98-a-0023 84.196375 88.898000 and uh no unfortunately scallops are one of the more expensive
sw3025A-ms98-a-0024 88.898000 90.972250 uh fish items
sw3025A-ms98-a-0025 90.972250 94.448500 but you know i i look for them to go on sale at the grocery store

sw3025A-ms98-a-0042 141.385750 150.929625 yeah i- i i don't feel like they are very healthy and i always feel like the home cooking places are are the healthiest meals even though i tend to have chicken fried steak when i [laughter-go] [laughter-go] [laughter-to] [laughter-them]
sw3025A-ms98-a-0043 150.929625 155.745250 [silence]

sw3025A-ms98-a-0050 170.854375 178.474250 yeah i i tend to uh i get teased by my family a lot because uh i like experimenting on
sw3025A-ms98-a-0051 178.474250 183.650625 on food and sometimes i go for ex[otic]- fairly exotic
sw3025A-ms98-a-0052 183.650625 187.410000 things and and my father teases me about gourmet cooking
sw3025A-ms98-a-0053 187.410000 194.549125 which is not always true but [laughter] and the thing about experimenting with cooking or anything else is that some of the experiments fail
sw3025A-ms98-a-0054 194.549125 196.237625 [silence]
sw3025A-ms98-a-0055 196.237625 204.281000 uh last time we had some uh friends over for dinner i tried the dessert that sounded wonder[ful]- wonderful in the recipe and it was just total bust
sw3025A-ms98-a-0056 204.281000 206.993750 i was sorry i didn't have some ice cream to fall back on
sw3025A-ms98-a-0057 206.993750 213.745750 [silence]
sw3025A-ms98-a-0058 213.745750 215.704625 oh my that's ambitious

sw3025A-ms98-a-0068 251.740000 255.571000 see i am not that's interesting one of the things i don't make is dessert
sw3025A-ms98-a-0069 255.571000 265.624875 and uh my husband accuses me of putting him through dessert deprivation because you know we have ice cream [laughter] or something like that and that's why when i took did this
sw3025A-ms98-a-0070 265.624875 271.961500 experiment for this company we had about three weeks ago it was just a total fiasco
sw3025A-ms98-a-0071 271.961500 273.481750 um
sw3025A-ms98-a-0072 273.481750 276.475875 everything else was fine but that was a fiasco

sw3025A-ms98-a-0074 278.300500 280.646875 uh yeah
sw3025A-ms98-a-0075 280.646875 286.982375 yeah and i i also don't have much of a sweet tooth so i can live without live without desserts for the most part
sw3025A-ms98-a-0076 286.982375 291.603750 [silence]
sw3025A-ms98-a-0077 291.603750 293.141125 yeah

sw3025A-ms98-a-0080 298.730000 299.993875 yeah
sw3025A-ms98-a-0081 299.993875 304.563625 well when i was single i used to uh i think my favorite meal was a
sw3025A-ms98-a-0082 304.563625 306.163875 a baked potato
sw3025A-ms98-a-0083 306.163875 307.264125 [silence]
sw3025A-ms98-a-0084 307.264125 308.923250 and
sw3025A-ms98-a-0085 308.923250 310.506750 oh yeah
sw3025A-ms98-a-0086 310.506750 317.653375 oh yeah and i mean i never put anything other than a little butter on it if i had or or if i had a little cheddar cheese sometimes i would grate that up
sw3025A-ms98-a-0087 317.653375 319.734625 [silence]
sw3025A-ms98-a-0088 319.734625 323.193750 and uh amazingly satisfying
sw3025A-ms98-a-0089 323.193750 335.580625 [silence]
sw3025A-ms98-a-0090 335.580625 339.556500 yeah i did[n't]- i didn't say it was nourishing but it was satisfying
sw3025A-ms98-a-0091 339.556500 340.788625 [silence]
sw3025A-ms98-a-0092 340.788625 342.351125 and
sw3025A-ms98-a-0093 342.351125 344.337750 yeah
sw3025A-ms98-a-0094 344.337750 352.295375 yeah that but you know um i i never really enjoyed cooking for myself so i ate very simply and i was
sw3025A-ms98-a-0095 352.295375 362.183750 that's why i think that's one reason i like having people over because i could try things i mean i must be a frustrated chemist or something like that because_1 cooking is a little bit like like being in a chemistry lab
sw3025A-ms98-a-0096 362.183750 364.217000 and uh
sw3025A-ms98-a-0097 364.217000 365.827250 [silence]
sw3025A-ms98-a-0098 365.827250 367.895375 [laughter] [laughter-instead] of having an explosive
sw3025A-ms98-a-0099 367.895375 368.821500 [laughter]
sw3025A-ms98-a-0100 368.821500 369.654500 [laughter]
sw3025A-ms98-a-0101 369.654500 371.695625 sometimes it blows up anyway
sw3025A-ms98-a-0102 371.695625 377.535250 i i once had a an old boy friend over to to dinner when i was just briefly staying with my parents
sw3025A-ms98-a-0103 377.535250 379.049750 and uh
sw3025A-ms98-a-0104 379.049750 384.231125 i had this wonderful recipe and and you were supposed to make a a toffee like substance
sw3025A-ms98-a-0105 384.231125 387.817000 for a pie by uh boiling evaporated milk
sw3025A-ms98-a-0106 387.817000 391.504875 three hours and it does turn to toffee inside the can
sw3025A-ms98-a-0107 391.504875 395.146000 and uh the only problem was when i opened the can
sw3025A-ms98-a-0108 395.146000 401.939250 it just flew all over the place it was on the ceiling and on the walls and on me and and the boyfriend 
sw3025A-ms98-a-0109 401.939250 409.144500 thought that was su[pposed]- he was supposed to be there at six o'clock not seven o'clock so just at the time all this happened the door bell rang and there he was
sw3025A-ms98-a-0110 409.144500 416.632000 and i had to have my my my my dad sort of entertain him for a [laughter] for for awhile while my mother and i scrambled to clean everything up
sw3025A-ms98-a-0111 416.632000 419.403500 [silence]
sw3025A-ms98-a-0112 419.403500 423.681375 uh i really don't remember that was about ten years ago i just remember
sw3025A-ms98-a-0113 423.681375 430.476875 how embarrassing it was and i have made i have made it since i've i i and several times before and i never had that problem just that one time
sw3025A-ms98-a-0114 430.476875 431.570500 [silence]
sw3025A-ms98-a-0115 431.570500 435.253125 and uh he he was a gourmet cook he was kind of person who
sw3025A-ms98-a-0116 435.253125 444.479375 acted like he came from San Francisco and he had a very sophisticated taste i i really wanted to impress the heck out of him and and [laughter] well it was a memorable evening anyway
sw3025A-ms98-a-0117 444.479375 445.534125 [silence]
sw3025A-ms98-a-0118 445.534125 450.225250 uh but i d[o]- i i i do enjoy cooking so i was awfully glad i was given this
