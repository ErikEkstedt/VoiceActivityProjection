sw3099A-ms98-a-0006 11.767625 15.777250 i have some friends that have children uh not that many actually
sw3099A-ms98-a-0007 15.777250 17.295125 uh
sw3099A-ms98-a-0008 17.295125 19.115500 [silence]
sw3099A-ms98-a-0009 19.115500 21.738250 i do not really know [noise]
sw3099A-ms98-a-0010 21.738250 25.461375 excuse me too much about child care in New York um
sw3099A-ms98-a-0011 25.461375 28.836750 [noise]
sw3099A-ms98-a-0012 28.836750 30.489250 excuse me one second
sw3099A-ms98-a-0013 30.489250 31.527625 huh-uh
sw3099A-ms98-a-0014 31.527625 32.566000 [silence]
sw3099A-ms98-a-0015 32.566000 42.119375 no not at all in fact my situation is a little bit strange i was uh a student for many years and then graduated and went and worked in France for awhile
sw3099A-ms98-a-0016 42.119375 53.206875 and i've just come back and was doing consulting work so i am just taking a little bit of time off right now uh and i might
sw3099A-ms98-a-0017 53.206875 64.581375 yeah well hopefully i can do some consulting work at home and if i can do that it will yeah i'll be able to spend the time with my daughter and not have to worry too much about child care
sw3099A-ms98-a-0018 64.581375 70.937750 but uh i might start to go crazy with it too it is a little i- i miss the intellectual stimulation
sw3099A-ms98-a-0019 70.937750 76.520875 but at the same time i really it would break my heart to give her to a stranger right now and
sw3099A-ms98-a-0020 76.520875 79.503625 [silence]
sw3099A-ms98-a-0021 79.503625 80.938125 oh yes
sw3099A-ms98-a-0022 80.938125 83.548250 [silence]
sw3099A-ms98-a-0023 83.548250 84.824250 yeah
sw3099A-ms98-a-0024 84.824250 95.550000 well i think for me the important concerns i do not think i would put her in day care for joint situation right now unless it was like one other child with a with a person
sw3099A-ms98-a-0025 95.550000 102.560875 i wouldn't want her to be into a in a large day care situation so young because_1 i think a little infant just doesn't get the stimulation they need
sw3099A-ms98-a-0026 102.560875 115.030125 yeah maybe for if i needed to do work part time like four hours a day i might do that because_1 like you should get enough stimulation from me the rest of the time but uh i just think that you know when there's two year olds running around
sw3099A-ms98-a-0027 115.030125 126.433250 the whoever is taking care of them the care givers are going to pay attention to the two year olds and only when the infant screams are they going to go there and if not the infant is going to lay in the crib all day and maybe have a mobile above it to play with
sw3099A-ms98-a-0028 126.433250 131.486625 and you know i play with her most of the time she's awake and i think that is so important
sw3099A-ms98-a-0029 131.486625 134.384875 [noise]
sw3099A-ms98-a-0030 134.384875 135.434500 yeah
sw3099A-ms98-a-0031 135.434500 140.014375 well such as things for learning gives the child the stimulation i think is important
sw3099A-ms98-a-0032 140.014375 142.012875 and uh
sw3099A-ms98-a-0033 142.012875 145.042250 [silence]
sw3099A-ms98-a-0034 145.042250 146.443125 uh-huh
sw3099A-ms98-a-0035 146.443125 168.950125 [silence]
sw3099A-ms98-a-0036 168.950125 170.244625 uh-huh
sw3099A-ms98-a-0037 170.244625 184.256750 [silence]
sw3099A-ms98-a-0038 184.256750 185.429125 uh-huh
sw3099A-ms98-a-0039 185.429125 188.020125 [silence]
sw3099A-ms98-a-0040 188.020125 192.295375 yeah well she's she's just been doing all kinds of stuff where she's you know
sw3099A-ms98-a-0041 192.295375 201.821875 [vocalized-noise] she's two months now nine weeks and she's just drastically moving her eyes from one side to another and things like that and she's just started that like yesterday or the day before
sw3099A-ms98-a-0042 201.821875 209.622750 and so every days are different and i think that you know i think child care for infants is much harder than when they are older and
sw3099A-ms98-a-0043 209.622750 221.646500 i'll probably be going back to work around January whereas she'll be about eight or nine months old and so i think you know she'll be at a i have heard it's a roughage to put them into a
sw3099A-ms98-a-0044 221.646500 223.529875 yeah
sw3099A-ms98-a-0045 223.529875 225.034875 [silence]
sw3099A-ms98-a-0046 225.034875 226.927125 but but i think it
sw3099A-ms98-a-0047 226.927125 234.985000 [silence]
sw3099A-ms98-a-0048 234.985000 248.486500 yeah we're just going to have to see how things work out uh but i'm trying to you know leave her a fair amount even at this young age with her grandparents just to go to a movie and things like that so that she's used to other people taking care of her
sw3099A-ms98-a-0049 248.486500 257.052250 my parents my husband's parents are in France so it's a little bit harder but during you know she she she's met them already
sw3099A-ms98-a-0050 257.052250 260.051625 not that she will remember them but she's met them
sw3099A-ms98-a-0051 260.051625 270.132250 [silence]
sw3099A-ms98-a-0052 270.132250 271.935875 uh-huh
sw3099A-ms98-a-0053 271.935875 274.714375 are they all nearby
sw3099A-ms98-a-0054 274.714375 286.160250 [silence]
sw3099A-ms98-a-0055 286.160250 287.790750 yeah
sw3099A-ms98-a-0056 287.790750 289.511750 [silence]
sw3099A-ms98-a-0057 289.511750 292.871000 well if i work part time that might be doable
sw3099A-ms98-a-0058 292.871000 307.994000 [silence]
sw3099A-ms98-a-0059 307.994000 314.269875 yeah well right now the situation is so tight at many places that it's even hard to have a choice
sw3099A-ms98-a-0060 314.269875 328.391500 incredible but you know since this is people before they get pregnant are finding child care for the kids [laughter] and you know i just find that incredible and my sister-in-law is going to have a baby very very soon and she's intending to stay home with the baby
sw3099A-ms98-a-0061 328.391500 342.739625 and you know maybe do some freelance type work from home and so if i go back to work on a part time basis i'm hoping i can leave my daughter with her because_1 her daughter you know again will be a couple of months
sw3099A-ms98-a-0062 342.739625 357.734125 my daughter will be about six months older than hers and you know it'll be a little rough when she is a very very little infant but like when she is a month or so my sister-in-law has had lots and lots of experience dealing with babysitting for large families and so uh
sw3099A-ms98-a-0063 357.734125 370.233875 she might be able to do it a couple of hours a day and we coul[d]- might even be able to do it on a trade off basis that i watch their baby when they want to go out to dinner or to movies or whatever or if she wants an afternoon off even if she wants an afternoon just to work
sw3099A-ms98-a-0064 370.233875 374.335750 uh and not be bothered we might be able to exchange that way
sw3099A-ms98-a-0065 374.335750 380.630875 and so we'll just have to see how things work out but i think the whole you know ideally i think the
sw3099A-ms98-a-0066 380.630875 392.530500 businesses should have the day care centers there whether it's the parents who take turns watching the kids or whether they hire a couple of people and uh you know parents come down to supervise or whatever
sw3099A-ms98-a-0067 392.530500 393.497375 um
sw3099A-ms98-a-0068 393.497375 394.998500 [silence]
sw3099A-ms98-a-0069 394.998500 396.143000 yeah
sw3099A-ms98-a-0070 396.143000 401.930250 [silence]
sw3099A-ms98-a-0071 401.930250 403.896375 oh yeah
sw3099A-ms98-a-0072 403.896375 418.586750 [silence]
sw3099A-ms98-a-0073 418.586750 426.669500 yeah well she's my daughter doesn't seem to be on a real schedule yet and it's probably my fault because_1 i do not have a real schedule now but
sw3099A-ms98-a-0074 426.669500 435.396375 yeah well she's been staying up late at night and [laughter] you know sleeping late in the mornings and things is just fine by me
sw3099A-ms98-a-0075 435.396375 436.965500 right
sw3099A-ms98-a-0076 436.965500 449.727250 [silence]
