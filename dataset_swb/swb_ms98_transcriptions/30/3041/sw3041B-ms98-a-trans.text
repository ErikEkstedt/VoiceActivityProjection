sw3041B-ms98-a-0002 2.576375 11.883375 well i saw um lately i've seen Soap Dish which was a uh that was a lot of fun it was kind of a silly little film about soap operas and things
sw3041B-ms98-a-0003 11.883375 16.468750 yeah yeah it was it was okay it was not um
sw3041B-ms98-a-0004 16.468750 22.549000 not a wonderful film but it was i mean it was it was cute but not the biggest laugh i've seen
sw3041B-ms98-a-0005 22.549000 24.840250 i saw Thelma and Louise
sw3041B-ms98-a-0006 24.840250 30.828625 a couple of days ago and really liked that actually i saw it twice because i [laughter-liked] it so much

sw3041B-ms98-a-0009 38.898250 45.002625 let's see the um it's it's different it's kind of it's an action adventure kind of you know
sw3041B-ms98-a-0010 45.002625 50.015125 shoot them_1 up kind of film but it's with women in it instead of men so that's kind of a
sw3041B-ms98-a-0011 50.015125 59.994875 that's kind of a twist on the normal thing And it made me think a lot about you know you would applaud Bruce Willis in Die Hard if he was doing this but you might not be so
sw3041B-ms98-a-0012 59.994875 65.486500 you know so encouraging of Susan Sarandon and Gena Davis when they do it
sw3041B-ms98-a-0013 65.486500 69.760250 so that was kind of interesting i've but i really enjoyed it
sw3041B-ms98-a-0014 69.760250 71.656000 so that was

sw3041B-ms98-a-0029 110.317750 115.925625 right well i think she kept saying that uh they talked about her it it was a film of her concert
sw3041B-ms98-a-0030 115.925625 124.086875 um tour she had taken through all all around the world and they were all objecting to her at the Vatican city and wouldn't let her perform in Rome and
sw3041B-ms98-a-0031 124.086875 128.897625 kept saying that her show was not garbage it had a social message to it and

sw3041B-ms98-a-0049 199.029000 209.028625 right i know i was i wondered if uh the tribes that they represented the tribe that was the the evil tribe if they were really as bad as
sw3041B-ms98-a-0050 209.028625 210.994750 they made them to be

sw3041B-ms98-a-0055 227.894625 234.476500 yeah but i wonder i thought the because they made a big deal about how this this film was such a big leap for the the people who
sw3041B-ms98-a-0056 234.476500 241.643250 who were the ancestors of these this Indian tribe and that you know that was so wonderful that they done that and they uh
sw3041B-ms98-a-0057 241.643250 247.467750 i- i wonder [laughter-about] how the ancestors of this warlike tribe if they were offended by the film if it
sw3041B-ms98-a-0058 247.467750 252.600375 you know you didn't hear any press about that i thought it was a very interesting movie
