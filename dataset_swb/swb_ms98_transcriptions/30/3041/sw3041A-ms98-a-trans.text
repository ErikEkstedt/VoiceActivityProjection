sw3041A-ms98-a-0044 159.669125 169.719750 how can i tell you um a couple years ago i guess well maybe ten years ago i i've read Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee and so you know just
sw3041A-ms98-a-0045 169.719750 180.178250 the general theme of the whole movie was um pretty i mean i really liked it a lot i mean it was a real consciousness raiser i guess
sw3041A-ms98-a-0046 180.178250 188.287250 um and i only bring up Wounded Knee because that was what ten years ago you read and and understood you know about the American pop
sw3041A-ms98-a-0047 188.287250 194.695500 Indian population and then everything went away for a couple years and now it's back again and you know it's
sw3041A-ms98-a-0048 194.695500 202.033250 sort of a popular view of um what happened way back then of course no one will ever know really i don't know
sw3041A-ms98-a-0049 202.033250 210.485750 [silence]
sw3041A-ms98-a-0050 210.485750 218.416375 well who knows i mean it it it sort of showed like two different types of tribes like one was a warring tribe and the other one was uh
sw3041A-ms98-a-0051 218.416375 228.942500 vegetarian kind of you know feel good tribe you know sort of thing so there possibly were because you know you always have conflict in the world nobody can get along peacefully
sw3041A-ms98-a-0052 228.942500 246.350625 [silence]
sw3041A-ms98-a-0053 246.350625 249.503375 oh i see yeah

sw3041A-ms98-a-0055 251.240000 259.051750 well i think so i um i have come to respect a little bit more the uh
sw3041A-ms98-a-0056 259.051750 268.156125 you know what went on here but but who knows how it's supposed to all end [laughter] you know on the on the broad scope i mean
sw3041A-ms98-a-0057 268.156125 270.066000 um
sw3041A-ms98-a-0058 270.066000 278.535625 like i said it it it had a much bigger thing i think meaning to me i think about you know just the meaning of um
sw3041A-ms98-a-0059 278.535625 290.386625 the freedom of this country and and what that really meant and that was taking over somebody else's freedoms and sort of trampling that and uh so
sw3041A-ms98-a-0060 290.386625 297.362750 you know it it meant something bigger i think but still it was a fantas[tic]- i loved the buffalo scene and
sw3041A-ms98-a-0061 297.362750 308.449500 and i thought Kevin Costner was just i got a little sick of his mug on the screen every three minutes but he's the director you know um but yeah i- i just thought it was
sw3041A-ms98-a-0062 308.449500 315.228625 a really interesting intense film intense i think is the word for it because_1 three hours went by really fast

sw3041A-ms98-a-0075 347.817125 354.625625 they sort of candy coated the western story for many years and um you know when the truth
sw3041A-ms98-a-0076 354.625625 363.714875 oh well it always balances out one way or the other once you get the whole story but have you seen any other movies because_1 you sound like you see a lot
