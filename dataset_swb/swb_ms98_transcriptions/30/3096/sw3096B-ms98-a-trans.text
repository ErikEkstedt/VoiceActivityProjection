sw3096B-ms98-a-0007 25.484750 39.700000 oh yes well uh have there been significant changes um you do you think in the uh employment place [ex[specially]-/especially] especially uh say at TI have has has anything in particular changed that you have noticed since during your what time there
sw3096B-ms98-a-0008 39.700000 45.979375 [silence]
sw3096B-ms98-a-0009 45.979375 49.813125 yeah uh-huh what what kind of work do you do
sw3096B-ms98-a-0010 49.813125 51.103250 uh-huh
sw3096B-ms98-a-0011 51.103250 53.389375 right [laughter]
sw3096B-ms98-a-0012 53.389375 55.249375 yes yes
sw3096B-ms98-a-0013 55.249375 64.341625 yes um yes in years past i know in fact even even the the word drafter is has uh changed because it used to be they were draftsman [laughter]
sw3096B-ms98-a-0014 64.341625 69.265750 [silence]
sw3096B-ms98-a-0015 69.265750 70.709375 right
sw3096B-ms98-a-0016 70.709375 74.365625 [laughter]
sw3096B-ms98-a-0017 74.365625 75.991500 maybe not huh [laughter]
sw3096B-ms98-a-0018 75.991500 83.126500 well um i uh when i was in college i graduated from college with my bachelor's degree in nineteen sixty four
sw3096B-ms98-a-0019 83.126500 96.189375 and i was a math major which was a real rarity among women at that time so i was in a lot of classes where uh there i was either the only girl or you know one of just a very few women in the class so that was a change and um
sw3096B-ms98-a-0020 96.189375 109.010125 even uh i didn't [vocalized-noise] uh use my math um in my work i- i became a technical writer but uh even so there were very very few women in technical writing but that has changed a lot 
sw3096B-ms98-a-0021 109.010125 119.879500 in recent years it's just really really changed a lot and and i think that uh you know the one thing that i have seen is that more and more women are getting into management but i think they've got a long way to go [laughter]
sw3096B-ms98-a-0022 119.879500 129.253625 there was something on TV the other day that said that fewer than one or two percent of the heads of uh chairmen of the board chair p[ersons]- chair persons uh if you say if you will
sw3096B-ms98-a-0023 129.253625 138.631625 of the board are women in this country and and i thought that you know that's pretty si[gnificantly]- a pretty significantly small number so there are some some strides to be made there
sw3096B-ms98-a-0024 138.631625 151.188375 but um i do not know i [vocalized-noise] i think we have come a long way actually when i think about you know when things were like even when i you know just when i was in high school and how it is now for girls and uh
sw3096B-ms98-a-0025 151.188375 165.416750 uh i guess my i [vocalized-noise] the one my one bad thing is that i am that i wish my mother had had some of those opportunities because i think she would have really she rea[lly]- would have succeeded in a lot of ways that men that women were not able to succeed [vocalized-noise] in her generation
sw3096B-ms98-a-0026 165.416750 167.900000 so anyway do you have children
sw3096B-ms98-a-0027 167.900000 170.634875 i was going to say do you have daughters that's always a good question because_1
sw3096B-ms98-a-0028 170.634875 172.183625 [laughter]
sw3096B-ms98-a-0029 172.183625 186.356125 yes in fact i have a daughter who is in [vocalized-noise] a who just graduated in civil engineering from college so she is pretty much although there were some other uh women in her class she was you know uh one of the minorities uh females in the class so
sw3096B-ms98-a-0030 186.356125 200.464750 she's definitely entering into uh a male profession but uh but you know now for instance there are there is uh the organization women uh the Society of Women Engineers so that is recognized as uh you know a place where women should be
sw3096B-ms98-a-0031 200.464750 213.988750 but uh i don't know i you you see it in uh also in uh like in the church uh where more and more women are becoming ministers in uh you know in uh protestant congregations and um
sw3096B-ms98-a-0032 213.988750 221.484125 it'll be interesting to see if if uh Roman Catholicism ever um uh recognizes women in in the role of priest
sw3096B-ms98-a-0033 221.484125 227.211000 i do[n't]- i don't know if you are Roman Catholic or you know what what you know about that i am not either but uh
sw3096B-ms98-a-0034 227.211000 235.949250 that is one area where i[t]- it that i can see c[ould]- might change but i really doubt will change [laughter]
sw3096B-ms98-a-0035 235.949250 239.472875 no probably not huh-uh so
sw3096B-ms98-a-0036 239.472875 249.170875 uh uh how about what in particular would you think that uh women still other than the work place where women still are being uh
sw3096B-ms98-a-0037 249.170875 251.971750 oh you know uh uh f[ound]-
sw3096B-ms98-a-0038 251.971750 256.748500 found wanting or you know or not re[garded]- [vocalized-noise] as highly regarded as men would be
sw3096B-ms98-a-0039 256.748500 267.939000 um i was just trying to think oh i know something maybe you could te[ll]- what do you think that what do you think tell me what you think about this um the uh the role of women in combat roles during the war
sw3096B-ms98-a-0040 267.939000 279.840000 because i know that there now there they want the armed forces to recognize that women can serve in combat roles and the only uh branch in the armed fo[rces]- ser[vices]- services that seems willing to do that is the Air Force
sw3096B-ms98-a-0041 279.840000 294.716375 and uh i spoke because see the women were filing f[lying]- flying m[issions]- missions into you know for whatever reason into uh in the Persian Gulf war and so but i know some of the other services do not think that women are capable of doing the job
sw3096B-ms98-a-0042 294.716375 300.172250 was real interesting they were i was listening to some of the comments on ra[dio]- television the other day uh about it and
sw3096B-ms98-a-0043 300.172250 313.774625 uh one of one of the men who was uh i do not know if he was a general or you know what his rank was very high he said it's just a personal thing with me i mean i can't be real you know i can not tell you why i feel this way but i just would rather have uh a man doing some of these jobs than a woman
sw3096B-ms98-a-0044 313.774625 320.396125 i thought well at least he was honest [laughter] [laughter-but] that does not sit very well with a lot of folks i'm sure [laughter]
sw3096B-ms98-a-0045 320.396125 321.922375 [silence]
sw3096B-ms98-a-0046 321.922375 324.669375 yeah right [laughter]
sw3096B-ms98-a-0047 324.669375 334.760000 you know now well now as far as i am concerned and now i could be wrong about this but the only one area where a woman couldn't do it is if she just physically did not have the strength to do something
sw3096B-ms98-a-0048 334.760000 347.527875 uh because i would think i think you know mentally um and emotionally i think that women can handle a job and every bit as well so anyway it's it'll be interesting to see where it all goes
sw3096B-ms98-a-0049 347.527875 349.025750 sure
sw3096B-ms98-a-0050 349.025750 350.612750 [silence]
sw3096B-ms98-a-0051 350.612750 353.538250 no i wouldn't either [laughter]
sw3096B-ms98-a-0052 353.538250 364.996625 no i agree but i am sure that there are women who would would relish that you know kind of an a job so uh i guess that should be taken into consideration as well so
sw3096B-ms98-a-0053 364.996625 376.119500 well [noise] this is an interesting topic um i've you know i've having a daughter who has gone into this into engi[neering]- engi[neering]- engineering i sort of watched her progress to see if she did anything differently than i did [laughter]
sw3096B-ms98-a-0054 376.119500 385.793750 and uh she's a lot uh more forthright about her opinions and a little more assertive uh than i think i was [laughter] so that's that's progress i guess [laughter]
sw3096B-ms98-a-0055 385.793750 392.857375 well i have enjoyed talking with you Lisa and um uh have you talked with a lot of people in this project or
sw3096B-ms98-a-0056 392.857375 394.564875 [silence]
sw3096B-ms98-a-0057 394.564875 395.844500 yeah
sw3096B-ms98-a-0058 395.844500 397.959250 oh yes
sw3096B-ms98-a-0059 397.959250 399.922500 [silence]
sw3096B-ms98-a-0060 399.922500 401.680000 oh yeah
sw3096B-ms98-a-0061 401.680000 402.710375 right
sw3096B-ms98-a-0062 402.710375 403.931375 [silence]
sw3096B-ms98-a-0063 403.931375 406.621000 yeah well that's great that's good
sw3096B-ms98-a-0064 406.621000 408.146500 [silence]
sw3096B-ms98-a-0065 408.146500 409.270250 yeah
sw3096B-ms98-a-0066 409.270250 410.690750 [silence]
sw3096B-ms98-a-0067 410.690750 412.468125 yeah well
sw3096B-ms98-a-0068 412.468125 421.722500 yeah well that's good that's good because um i- i guess i placed all but one or two of my calls and uh only because i thought if i'm going to make some money
sw3096B-ms98-a-0069 421.722500 428.843500 see we [vocalized-noise] our choir is doing this as a money ma[king]- raising project we we got the connection through a TI uh church member and
sw3096B-ms98-a-0070 428.843500 437.632250 um so we are doing it to raise money for uh a large project at church and um so i feel like this is one way i can contribute that's not too painful [laughter]
sw3096B-ms98-a-0071 437.632250 443.589750 financially painful anyway it's just real nice that way so i thought well i will just get on the stick and do it
sw3096B-ms98-a-0072 443.589750 447.434625 well i will say good-bye to you but i have enjoyed the conversation
