sw3006A-ms98-a-0014 73.220875 87.692375 ours would lean more toward uh i guess monetary concerns rather than the formality of the deal if if we were having a bunch of friends over if there were six to ten coming over we'd end up serving anything with chicken due due to its cheapness
sw3006A-ms98-a-0015 87.692375 100.094125 and uh [noise] oh you can run a a a regular spaghetti or even a chicken spaghetti type casseroles anything that that can be spread over a large number of people for a few number of dollars

sw3006A-ms98-a-0017 113.194500 118.995125 i grew up in a [noise] in a family that that had a a few formal things but uh
sw3006A-ms98-a-0018 118.995125 131.453750 my mother was deaf and and hung around the house a lot so she developed a uh a cooking habit that was just unmatched by most of her peers and we ate some very
sw3006A-ms98-a-0019 131.453750 139.781875 good food and then large quantities of it and even to this day with the two of them uh retired and and none of the kids at home and
sw3006A-ms98-a-0020 139.781875 153.841875 they still keep a large refrigerator totally full i- i just can't imagine i mean even our refrigerator with a family of four does not have the food content that they manage to do [noise] so she still likes to to cook a large uh variety of foods um
sw3006A-ms98-a-0021 153.841875 164.639250 my wife on the other hand comes out of the military type family and and they were always on the go and they never really had a a formal setting as it were and so she tends to cook a little more uh
sw3006A-ms98-a-0022 164.639250 170.985875 informal type things and when we have friends over it's usually just for a uh a light
sw3006A-ms98-a-0023 170.985875 178.994750 pretty much what we would eat anyway a light informal meal and they usually bring something a desert or a salad or whatever and uh
sw3006A-ms98-a-0024 178.994750 189.848000 i do like the uh [laughter] my wife's motto when she finds something she wants to experiment on she'll experiment on company because_1 usually they're polite enough to eat it anyway [laughter] instead of the
sw3006A-ms98-a-0025 189.848000 200.126500 family you know so so we do get some weird concoctions on occasion that she'll she'll experiment on things she has a real uh nice repertoire of uh desserts and uh
