sw3006B-ms98-a-0002 1.991125 12.839625 well that would have to depend on the uh number of people and the nature of the party fairly small parties with people that i know i tend to be a little bit more casual and i would tend to
sw3006B-ms98-a-0003 12.839625 18.383000 to uh serve things that were buffet style perhaps we'd have uh
sw3006B-ms98-a-0004 18.383000 29.292375 oh i like those little little cocktail sausages in barbecue sauce or or maybe a sausage ball uh crackers and dips chips maybe uh
sw3006B-ms98-a-0005 29.292375 37.872250 probably have some kind of a of a salad uh that's easy to pick up and spread
sw3006B-ms98-a-0006 37.872250 44.731500 fresh veggies probably uh possibly uh blocks of cheese and chunks of uh deli meat
sw3006B-ms98-a-0007 44.731500 46.002625 [silence]
sw3006B-ms98-a-0008 46.002625 56.497375 have to include some fruit of some kind i prefer berries uh like sugared grapes and things that are very attractive to set out on a on a table
sw3006B-ms98-a-0009 56.497375 65.992500 a little bit more formal dinner party you might have just a little bit more formal setting i don't have a lot of formal dinner parties so i can't tell you a whole lot about that
sw3006B-ms98-a-0010 65.992500 74.455625 but i tend to be very lazy and want to do what is easy but looks and tastes good so

sw3006B-ms98-a-0033 200.322750 201.995250 well
sw3006B-ms98-a-0034 201.995250 213.576500 in recent years i have become far more conscience of conscious of balancing the diet and having healthy foods if i were having people over i would want
sw3006B-ms98-a-0035 213.576500 221.653250 healthy food to be one of the considerations most of my friends really would prefer a bowl of fruit as opposed to a big gooey cake
sw3006B-ms98-a-0036 221.653250 233.496125 uh they would prefer fresh stick veggies as opposed to chips and dips although there are some hard crust chips and dippers uh
sw3006B-ms98-a-0037 233.496125 241.760625 and i i'd like to have a little bit of nutrition content in the foods i'll be careful but for example about the kind of cracker that i pick to go under a spread
sw3006B-ms98-a-0038 241.760625 253.456500 i may be concerned about the number of calories that are going into the spread i know i watch my weight and i'm sure that most of my friends do too and i appreciate somebody being conscious of that when i go visit
sw3006B-ms98-a-0039 253.456500 268.229500 so i do try to cook more healthy than i did even five years ago five years ago i let my palate dictate uh now i'm more conscious along with everybody else
sw3006B-ms98-a-0040 268.229500 270.515375 about the kind of food uh-huh
sw3006B-ms98-a-0041 270.515375 272.292125 [silence]

sw3006B-ms98-a-0045 279.488125 289.970000 well there was a time for example that i would've made a big gooey creamy pie for dessert now now i may use an angel food cake with fruit and a light whipped topping
sw3006B-ms98-a-0046 289.970000 295.445125 far fewer calories and far less cholesterol uh
sw3006B-ms98-a-0047 295.445125 302.988250 uh-huh uh-huh and just as palatable i love peaches and strawberries and i sure take advantage of them_1 in season

sw3006B-ms98-a-0049 304.486375 318.164625 and uh as far as the the party snacks uh i may fix a trail mix or a caramel popcorn for snacking as opposed to what pure peanuts
sw3006B-ms98-a-0050 318.164625 326.484000 yeah or or something else that that really is loaded with empty nutri[ents]- with empty calories no nutrition
sw3006B-ms98-a-0051 326.484000 327.519000 [silence]
sw3006B-ms98-a-0052 327.519000 331.295500 oh yeah it's a favorite uh-huh uh-huh
sw3006B-ms98-a-0053 331.295500 334.990625 uh-huh yeah uh-huh
sw3006B-ms98-a-0054 334.990625 336.804375 that's right

sw3006B-ms98-a-0056 338.999875 348.684500 uh-huh well i tend to i- i [vocalized-noise] nearly everything i try to balance uh you can take everything to an extreme
sw3006B-ms98-a-0057 348.684500 360.922375 everything to an extreme and i'm not going to take the flavor and the pleasure out of the food in order to make it quote healthy i'd rather die than eat terrible tasting food
sw3006B-ms98-a-0058 360.922375 363.938875 yeah yeah and there are you know you
sw3006B-ms98-a-0059 363.938875 376.707375 people whose systems are accustomed to that kind of discipline can actually tolerate it much better than those who are not i know that when i began to add bran to my diet i had terrible bellyache [laughter] until i until my system became accustomed to it
sw3006B-ms98-a-0060 376.707375 390.277125 and uh by the same token when my husband and i first married he was accustomed to a a greasy diet lots of fried foods and i nearly died then [laughter] because i was accustomed to fresh vegetables and baked meats
sw3006B-ms98-a-0061 390.277125 404.065000 or broiled meats or grilled meats i prefer my meat grilled to fried anytime i may do a little stir fry or a little wok or something like that but i do not fry my foods that much anymore used to but i don't anymore
sw3006B-ms98-a-0062 404.065000 413.140500 two reasons one it's just not that healthy and it makes my stomach upset second it's a big mess to clean up [laughter] i'm not interested in cleaning up a mess
sw3006B-ms98-a-0063 413.140500 414.167000 [silence]
