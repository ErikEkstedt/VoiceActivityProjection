sw3065A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 2.926625 [noise] okay do you uh think we should go metric
sw3065A-ms98-a-0002 2.926625 8.698250 [silence]
sw3065A-ms98-a-0003 8.698250 9.976500 [vocalized-noise]

sw3065A-ms98-a-0005 18.641375 25.533625 yeah i think that the i think what i mean i don't know what happened last time i remember they tried it in the seventies at one point or something and
sw3065A-ms98-a-0006 25.533625 26.720875 [silence]
sw3065A-ms98-a-0007 26.720875 28.321125 yeah me too
sw3065A-ms98-a-0008 28.321125 30.809125 [silence]
sw3065A-ms98-a-0009 30.809125 39.978125 right and and i don't quite know why it failed um i would bet the push [vocalized-noise] it i bet the push just wasn't big enough they didn't sort of encourage 
sw3065A-ms98-a-0010 39.978125 50.395625 i mean businesses and things to use it so you know what [noise] what i think they'd have to do would be to have both things on there for a while and then and then start phasing things out so
sw3065A-ms98-a-0011 50.395625 51.921625 yeah
sw3065A-ms98-a-0012 51.921625 55.926125 [silence]
sw3065A-ms98-a-0013 55.926125 62.733625 right i was just thinking two liter bottles are what you buy and one liter bottles you don't buy quarts and gallons anymore of soda
sw3065A-ms98-a-0014 62.733625 75.560625 [silence]
sw3065A-ms98-a-0015 75.560625 83.642000 right and and and even though the car says miles and kilometers you don't say i went a hundred kilometers [vocalized-noise]
sw3065A-ms98-a-0016 83.642000 85.390000 you know
sw3065A-ms98-a-0017 85.390000 89.311750 yeah i would i would be total loss i think
sw3065A-ms98-a-0018 89.311750 98.641250 i think though if there was some you know sort of government incentive program or something people would begin to switch over you know and i think there would be the hard core older people who would get really pissed and 
sw3065A-ms98-a-0019 98.641250 100.922500 pardon my expression there but um
sw3065A-ms98-a-0020 100.922500 107.220750 who would get really you know upset and start to complain and get all cranky and stuff but i think in the end it would make life a lot easier for us
sw3065A-ms98-a-0021 107.220750 108.863125 f[or]- coming up
sw3065A-ms98-a-0022 108.863125 120.192375 [silence]
sw3065A-ms98-a-0023 120.192375 121.471500 yeah
sw3065A-ms98-a-0024 121.471500 130.971000 [silence]
sw3065A-ms98-a-0025 130.971000 140.611875 right well what i think i think the difference between now and then might be this is just a might is we were the first generation that was [vocalized-noise] in elementary school
sw3065A-ms98-a-0026 140.611875 149.804375 and if they kept it up so let's say imagine they had kept going you'd have you know two or three more generations that all now are are familiar with the metric system not like
sw3065A-ms98-a-0027 149.804375 154.882875 could use it comfortably right now but i could convert you know i could carry around a little conversion card or something and
sw3065A-ms98-a-0028 154.882875 162.058375 i could handle it for a while and then and then eventually i'd learn and i think that before it was just you know just a bunch of little kids using it
sw3065A-ms98-a-0029 162.058375 167.737375 and now i think there are enough people you know sort of as we get older i think others that will bring more generations in on it
sw3065A-ms98-a-0030 167.737375 180.811625 eventually they'll be able to make the switch and we're not going to start going crazy and yelling and saying what are you crazy we can't understand you we'll say oh it's a pain in the neck but it's for the better and we'll sort of deal with it i think
sw3065A-ms98-a-0031 180.811625 188.460000 i don't know i- i- i would hope it would uh it seems like it's a reasonable system i mean everything seems to be based on the same thing
sw3065A-ms98-a-0032 188.460000 193.488125 [silence]
sw3065A-ms98-a-0033 193.488125 194.588625 right [noise]

sw3065A-ms98-a-0035 199.284750 200.810750 centimeters

sw3065A-ms98-a-0037 202.310000 205.563250 yeah but i wonder if if
sw3065A-ms98-a-0038 205.563250 208.619125 but [laughter-yeah] right [laughter]
sw3065A-ms98-a-0039 208.619125 216.033250 yeah but i wonder if that's even something that you know they they have to change immediately they could just you know sort of phase that in so start
sw3065A-ms98-a-0040 216.033250 225.096500 you know from now like from now on all licenses would have that rather than going back and changing everything you know all new licenses as of nineteen ninety two would have it or something
sw3065A-ms98-a-0041 225.096500 227.744875 [silence]
sw3065A-ms98-a-0042 227.744875 229.355125 [laughter]
sw3065A-ms98-a-0043 229.355125 230.395625 [silence]
sw3065A-ms98-a-0044 230.395625 238.406125 that's right [laughter] i know the and oh yeah i know though at the uh at the amusement parks they say if you're under forty two inches or something
sw3065A-ms98-a-0045 238.406125 248.432500 you can't walk in here you have to be under well i guess what what i bet what they do in that case they uh see what some of them is like you know they say if you're not taller than this line
sw3065A-ms98-a-0046 248.432500 251.116125 [silence]
sw3065A-ms98-a-0047 251.116125 252.574250 that's right
sw3065A-ms98-a-0048 252.574250 253.844000 [silence]
sw3065A-ms98-a-0049 253.844000 255.231000 it
sw3065A-ms98-a-0050 255.231000 260.569500 it would be a neat case where like where kids taught the parents i think you know
sw3065A-ms98-a-0051 260.569500 264.161500 [silence]
sw3065A-ms98-a-0052 264.161500 266.924750 but i don't know Eng[land]- Eng[land]- England is not
sw3065A-ms98-a-0053 266.924750 270.582500 [silence]
sw3065A-ms98-a-0054 270.582500 271.942875 oh

sw3065A-ms98-a-0056 275.279750 279.214750 yeah but i mean but but virtually the rest of the world is i mean it seems like
sw3065A-ms98-a-0057 279.214750 284.633125 like like like sort of stupid i mean we are of course we are Americans and we're supposed to be you know
sw3065A-ms98-a-0058 284.633125 288.602500 that's that's right and and now we're backwards
sw3065A-ms98-a-0059 288.602500 290.835250 [silence]
sw3065A-ms98-a-0060 290.835250 298.715875 [noise] no i- i- i would think i mean a a ba[se]- a base ten system as compared to a base twelve system makes a lot more sense
sw3065A-ms98-a-0061 298.715875 299.890250 [silence]
sw3065A-ms98-a-0062 299.890250 302.824500 no oh actually no um
sw3065A-ms98-a-0063 302.824500 304.861625 let's see it's
sw3065A-ms98-a-0064 304.861625 306.618250 [silence]
sw3065A-ms98-a-0065 306.618250 312.020375 [noise] i don't know oh yeah i- i always forget i don't even know how many ounces are in a pound i just sort of make it up
sw3065A-ms98-a-0066 312.020375 317.425625 [silence]
sw3065A-ms98-a-0067 317.425625 322.165250 i can right [laughter-those] [laughter-those] what you go to wouldn't be a problem
sw3065A-ms98-a-0068 322.165250 324.410250 [silence]
sw3065A-ms98-a-0069 324.410250 327.384125 let's see how many cups equal that
sw3065A-ms98-a-0070 327.384125 335.284875 i- i have no idea i just uh i know things like you know a [noise] pint is a pound the world around or something that's all i know
sw3065A-ms98-a-0071 335.284875 347.305875 i- i learned that because uh a friend of mine [noise] i- i had two friends and i had more friends than that but two friends of mine in college [laughter] i had a lot more than two i promise um we opened a jelly bean business
sw3065A-ms98-a-0072 347.305875 356.000875 and we sold jelly beans and we had uh no idea how many you know we we didn't bo[ther]- we didn't bother buying a scale
sw3065A-ms98-a-0073 356.000875 365.019500 we'd go out and just buy you know five pound bags of sixteen different flavors put it in plastic shoe boxes and and then and then sell them for X amount per pound or quarter pound or something
sw3065A-ms98-a-0074 365.019500 377.300750 and we did[n't]- we didn't bother buying a scale and one of my friends was a physics one of these guys was a physics major and he said well just remember a pint is a pound the world around and he got the measuring cup and just measured i think a cup or two cup whatever is a pint
sw3065A-ms98-a-0075 377.300750 378.353625 [silence]
sw3065A-ms98-a-0076 378.353625 383.172375 gee i think wh[at]- i think he want the calculation at home and it turns out that he was actually pretty close
sw3065A-ms98-a-0077 383.172375 390.947750 if anything we were actually in favor of the consumer so so we were giving them a little too much but that was our general tendency anyway
sw3065A-ms98-a-0078 390.947750 392.381500 hm
sw3065A-ms98-a-0079 392.381500 402.294375 yeah well we were you know we were in it was it was almost like we did it for the hell of it in school we really didn't make you know i think we were only making seventy five dollars each profit at the end of the year
sw3065A-ms98-a-0080 402.294375 406.424125 you know after after an entire semester but we had a hell of a lot of fun doing it
sw3065A-ms98-a-0081 406.424125 407.456375 [silence]
sw3065A-ms98-a-0082 407.456375 421.450625 yeah we we we tended to eat a lot and our friends would just sort of walk by and just put their hands in it and we had another friend um the physics major again he wasn't he wasn't aware of jelly bean physiology i guess and he got into a snowball fight
sw3065A-ms98-a-0083 421.450625 433.859625 with the jelly beans nearby and he just and and [vocalized-noise] some snow fell into one of the cartons so he brought them into the bathroom to wash them off and basically what we had sort of non coated beans at that point 
sw3065A-ms98-a-0084 433.859625 435.004250 [silence]
sw3065A-ms98-a-0085 435.004250 448.661000 uh it's just uh it's just the the same they're like an outer coating and there's just sort of th[is]- this stuff you see you know it's sort of like glorified sugar i don't know but when you rinse them off all you get is uh is uh the coating
