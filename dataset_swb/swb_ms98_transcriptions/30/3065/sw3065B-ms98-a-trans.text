sw3065B-ms98-a-0002 2.337250 8.748000 well i- i oh i don't know it's kind of a tricky question because i think it's it's a practical system
sw3065B-ms98-a-0003 8.748000 15.849500 obviously if it's all compatible and it you know tens and things make sense um
sw3065B-ms98-a-0004 15.849500 20.453625 it's it's a switch the problem would just be the switch over [vocalized-noise]
sw3065B-ms98-a-0005 20.453625 24.430375 [silence]
sw3065B-ms98-a-0006 24.430375 32.166875 right that's when i was in the elementary school years and we all we all learned that metric and they were ready we were going to be metric and

sw3065B-ms98-a-0010 48.731375 54.970625 so i think that's what they did at first was that they had metric and and i mean and there's things that we've gone metric we have metric
sw3065B-ms98-a-0011 54.970625 58.204875 cola now you can buy that and you can
sw3065B-ms98-a-0012 58.204875 62.230375 [silence]
sw3065B-ms98-a-0013 62.230375 67.593000 so that you know so that we have little things that are metric but no one
sw3065B-ms98-a-0014 67.593000 78.769750 talks about you know uh you buy nine by twelve frames you don't buy [laughter] centimeter length frames and cooking pans

sw3065B-ms98-a-0024 106.218125 108.422500 yeah it really would
sw3065B-ms98-a-0025 108.422500 115.113875 it's i- i it's because_1 i think they had a good try there when they started with us in the elementary schools trying to
sw3065B-ms98-a-0026 115.113875 120.511125 you know get that in our minds so that we could ch[ange]- i mean because_1 i think our generation could make a change
sw3065B-ms98-a-0027 120.511125 129.150125 it would be difficult but it would not be as difficult for people say fifty years old now who are have never been exposed to the metric system other than
sw3065B-ms98-a-0028 129.150125 132.691375 you know buying a t[wo]- two liter Coke and that's
