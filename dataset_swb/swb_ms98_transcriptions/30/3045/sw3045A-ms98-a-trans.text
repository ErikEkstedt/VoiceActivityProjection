sw3045A-ms98-a-0036 128.085000 142.908500 um and was finally able to this is oh been like fourteen years ago we moved here and i was finally able to afford a new typewriter and i got an IBM Selectric i thought i had died and gone to heaven because [laughter] i thought oh they're so wonderful well then um
sw3045A-ms98-a-0037 142.908500 153.715125 yeah [laughter] ours really needs to have some work done on it but but then my husband um worked at TI and i got a um this has been years ago he doesn't work there anymore but he got a um
sw3045A-ms98-a-0038 153.715125 165.458875 um the the TI Professional and brought that home and i learned WordStar on that and boy once that happened there was just no way that i could ever go back to doing anything of length on a typewriter
sw3045A-ms98-a-0039 165.458875 168.963125 [silence]
sw3045A-ms98-a-0040 168.963125 170.342375 uh-huh

sw3045A-ms98-a-0042 171.505250 177.974375 yeah have you ever used do you use WordPerfect ever have you ever used WordPerfect or
sw3045A-ms98-a-0043 177.974375 180.497125 [silence]
sw3045A-ms98-a-0044 180.497125 181.995250 uh-huh
sw3045A-ms98-a-0045 181.995250 183.314125 [silence]
sw3045A-ms98-a-0046 183.314125 184.759125 right
sw3045A-ms98-a-0047 184.759125 187.524125 yeah yeah that's probably where you've used it
sw3045A-ms98-a-0048 187.524125 188.534125 [silence]
sw3045A-ms98-a-0049 188.534125 194.038750 uh-huh yeah um i have that on my uh computer here and
sw3045A-ms98-a-0050 194.038750 201.468625 also um i w[ork]- do some work at UTD and um that's what they have there and it was just so nice to be able just to step into the position and
sw3045A-ms98-a-0051 201.468625 215.393500 and already know the lan[guage]- you know already know the the software and um i don't know from my own experience um WordPerfect just just so much better than than WordStar at least the version of WordStar that i used to have it may be improved by now but
sw3045A-ms98-a-0052 215.393500 228.441375 yeah it's uh WordStar was never very intuitive to me i mean you know you some of the commands just had nothing to do with w[hat]- you know what you were supposed to be doing what they what they did on the com[puter]- computer but uh i mean like going um
sw3045A-ms98-a-0053 228.441375 234.828000 forward and backward a word or up and down a line that sort of thing just you know didn't match with the kinds of keys you were using
sw3045A-ms98-a-0054 234.828000 243.496250 yeah and but WordPerfect is just a lot more intuitive in a lot of ways and you and it does a lot of things too that if you if you do any kind of uh
sw3045A-ms98-a-0055 243.496250 250.654125 research or anything like that where you have to uh use footnotes it is just wonderful because_1 it keeps track of all your footnotes
sw3045A-ms98-a-0056 250.654125 264.263250 and if you add it if you put a footnote in in the middle you know if you come up with some new piece of documentation and you put that in the middle of your paper and have to footnote it you just change um it just automatically changes all your footnoting numbers for you
sw3045A-ms98-a-0057 264.263250 265.512250 so you know it's just
sw3045A-ms98-a-0058 265.512250 267.060875 [silence]
sw3045A-ms98-a-0059 267.060875 278.709000 yeah yeah and i think about how it used to be if you were doing a paper [laughter-you] [laughter-had] [laughter-to] [laughter-go] [laughter-back] and retype everything and uh it was just awful so um i don't know i think we have just become
sw3045A-ms98-a-0060 278.709000 291.598875 really spoiled but i think it's a nice kind of way to be spoiled [laughter] so um well i have not really paid much attention to a clock although i think we've probably been talking at least ten minutes so um
sw3045A-ms98-a-0061 291.598875 296.497250 if you um unless you have some other things you want to talk about as having to do with PCs
sw3045A-ms98-a-0062 296.497250 310.999875 well um i was a technical writer for many years um and my husband and i actually met in a computer company um i was a tech writer and he was an engineer and uh so i did tech writing for a number of years
sw3045A-ms98-a-0063 310.999875 314.407750 [laughter] oh sure

sw3045A-ms98-a-0067 326.516875 340.903625 oh oh trying to figure out what all that was about huh [laughter] but um i have um that that was the majority of my writing although um i have also done oh freelance magazine writing and some educational writing and
sw3045A-ms98-a-0068 340.903625 352.425000 um for a while i had a um uh a partnership with a in an advertising agency with another woman who is a an artist so i did some advertising and PR but um
sw3045A-ms98-a-0069 352.425000 364.603500 now i'm ac[tually]- actually i'm i'm not working anymore i'm a student i'm a graduate student so i'm doing a lot of writing but uh now all of the sch[olastic]- scholastic nature so [laughter] i've done a little a lots of different kinds but
sw3045A-ms98-a-0070 364.603500 374.494250 i- i just know right now that i couldn't have put out half of what i did if that much without the being in computers so that's been really great and uh i'm so i'm real spoiled
sw3045A-ms98-a-0071 374.494250 376.673875 [silence]

sw3045A-ms98-a-0078 393.469750 402.741500 yeah well those are skills that she certainly w[ill]- is going to need early on and you know the and it seems like it's getting earlier and earlier with the children so
sw3045A-ms98-a-0079 402.741500 410.964625 um i think that that would be a real a real uh advantage to to her to have that and uh do it early so uh do y[ou]- do
sw3045A-ms98-a-0080 410.964625 412.753750 [silence]
