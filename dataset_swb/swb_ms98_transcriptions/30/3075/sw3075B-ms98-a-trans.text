sw3075B-ms98-a-0023 68.019375 88.468125 [silence]
sw3075B-ms98-a-0024 88.468125 95.884625 well [noise] we we as you do take family vacations uh sometimes one a year
sw3075B-ms98-a-0025 95.884625 104.156125 and but this year we're not going to be taking one for several reasons but vacations we really enjoy i think we've been on three cruises
sw3075B-ms98-a-0026 104.156125 109.512500 and we we really love cruises we've gone on Carnival Cruise Lines
sw3075B-ms98-a-0027 109.512500 119.997000 and uh we've gone fairly inexpensive from as most cruises go uh we usually book just a month before it's ready to go
sw3075B-ms98-a-0028 119.997000 126.174375 and we get upgraded last ti[me]- last two times in fact we had an outside room and it was beautiful
sw3075B-ms98-a-0029 126.174375 133.312750 and we like not having to take our suitcase in and out of hotel rooms and drag it all around it's kind of
sw3075B-ms98-a-0030 133.312750 136.132125 oh my God you do everything
sw3075B-ms98-a-0031 136.132125 145.486500 you i mean you can be as busy as you want to be or as laid back as you want to be you can sit in the sun all day around the pool
sw3075B-ms98-a-0032 145.486500 156.420625 or you can take part in the games that they have going on they always have bingo they have a casino uh they have a massage parlor they have exercise i mean you can do anything
sw3075B-ms98-a-0033 156.420625 164.753250 and that's just aboard ship and then when the ship docks you get to go sight seeing and shopping and that's quite fun
sw3075B-ms98-a-0034 164.753250 166.270500 [silence]
sw3075B-ms98-a-0035 166.270500 174.776625 uh Nassau San Juan Saint Thomas we've been there twice we went two cruises that hit those islands but with different people we we've gone with friends each time
sw3075B-ms98-a-0036 174.776625 184.553375 and then we went to uh the western Caribbean which is uh Port uh Cancun Cozumel
sw3075B-ms98-a-0037 184.553375 187.634250 and Ocho Rios pardon me
sw3075B-ms98-a-0038 187.634250 202.521750 yes uh-huh and but it was wonderful so we really like those and uh i guess we just like to go someplace someplace entirely different we've been to a few places in this country we still have a lot to see though
sw3075B-ms98-a-0039 202.521750 203.730375 [silence]
sw3075B-ms98-a-0040 203.730375 206.331375 we're from Illinois originally
sw3075B-ms98-a-0041 206.331375 215.923875 and we've been down in Texas eighteen years and so like you w[e]- we always try to make it you know back home to see the relatives we both still have family there
sw3075B-ms98-a-0042 215.923875 219.378500 and that's fun it brings back a lot of memories
sw3075B-ms98-a-0043 219.378500 226.663875 uh things are different there though they're uh i don't know it's just entirely different world
sw3075B-ms98-a-0044 226.663875 228.674750 than this area
sw3075B-ms98-a-0045 228.674750 230.130750 did you
sw3075B-ms98-a-0046 230.130750 231.219875 [silence]

sw3075B-ms98-a-0050 240.149375 245.543625 [silence]
sw3075B-ms98-a-0051 245.543625 247.022250 uh-huh
sw3075B-ms98-a-0052 247.022250 249.502375 [silence]
sw3075B-ms98-a-0053 249.502375 251.174000 oh that's great
sw3075B-ms98-a-0054 251.174000 256.484375 [silence]
sw3075B-ms98-a-0055 256.484375 259.202125 oh they they they really are we've
sw3075B-ms98-a-0056 259.202125 270.155625 yeah as i said we've done them three times we'd be going again this this year if circumstances hadn't changed we we'd probably go my husband would you know the minute i said the word he he he's chomping at the bit
sw3075B-ms98-a-0057 270.155625 272.836000 he kind of likes the casinos a little bit
sw3075B-ms98-a-0058 272.836000 275.012375 but i like all of it and
sw3075B-ms98-a-0059 275.012375 276.789625 [silence]
sw3075B-ms98-a-0060 276.789625 280.522875 i like seeing other countries and shopping in other places
sw3075B-ms98-a-0061 280.522875 290.039500 i like shopping i can shop anyplace shop in London and France and wherever now my kids are moving to Toronto so we're going to be able to go up there
sw3075B-ms98-a-0062 290.039500 293.963875 so i'm kind of looking forward to that except i hate to see them go
sw3075B-ms98-a-0063 293.963875 295.443000 but
sw3075B-ms98-a-0064 295.443000 296.487625 [silence]
sw3075B-ms98-a-0065 296.487625 302.966000 oh that's what everybody says and i i think it i i think i'll try to stay away except my my second grandchild will be born in 
sw3075B-ms98-a-0066 302.966000 305.309250 in the winter in January
sw3075B-ms98-a-0067 305.309250 307.328000 so that will be hard to stay away from
sw3075B-ms98-a-0068 307.328000 309.759250 [silence]
sw3075B-ms98-a-0069 309.759250 311.552875 yeah
sw3075B-ms98-a-0070 311.552875 314.503500 [silence]
sw3075B-ms98-a-0071 314.503500 316.894250 isn't that the truth uh-huh
sw3075B-ms98-a-0072 316.894250 323.556625 [silence]
sw3075B-ms98-a-0073 323.556625 336.408625 well there's all age grou[p]- groups too and that's that's kind of fun uh you if you sit at a table with a lot of people for your meals you meet different people you may meet people you know thirty years older than you or younger and
sw3075B-ms98-a-0074 336.408625 339.799875 everybody is really interesting and everybody is there to have a good time and
sw3075B-ms98-a-0075 339.799875 341.259125 and
sw3075B-ms98-a-0076 341.259125 343.930625 uh we've only gone on the seven day cruises
sw3075B-ms98-a-0077 343.930625 346.911875 they have shorter ones and then they have ten day ones
sw3075B-ms98-a-0078 346.911875 352.496125 but i think seven days is long enough for us by that time we're ready to get home and
sw3075B-ms98-a-0079 352.496125 365.175000 get back to our routine i think most vacations uh seven days is enough for us we've gone i think when we went to England and France we were there ten twelve days and that was pushing it a bit
sw3075B-ms98-a-0080 365.175000 369.146500 [silence]
sw3075B-ms98-a-0081 369.146500 370.762125 yeah
sw3075B-ms98-a-0082 370.762125 372.879500 well that that makes sense
sw3075B-ms98-a-0083 372.879500 376.010000 it really does i mean oh we went to Panama too
sw3075B-ms98-a-0084 376.010000 378.266375 went to Panama last August
sw3075B-ms98-a-0085 378.266375 380.504750 our son-in-law is from Panama
sw3075B-ms98-a-0086 380.504750 392.439250 and uh he we went with our daughter and son-in-law to visit his parents who live there and his father is a a doctor and his mother is a kindergarten teacher and they took time off it was
sw3075B-ms98-a-0087 392.439250 406.276500 their winter and they were having a little break so they took some time off that uh they could show us around and it it is a beautiful country it is beautiful they have mountains we were an hour away from the mountains or an hour away from the shore
sw3075B-ms98-a-0088 406.276500 414.648250 and it it is gorgeous they live in a small town called David which is northern Panama up near Costa Rica
sw3075B-ms98-a-0089 414.648250 424.474500 and uh it's it's just it's just a gorgeous country most people don't realize it i think if they could get tourists coming to their country they'd improve the economy considerably
sw3075B-ms98-a-0090 424.474500 426.582625 [silence]
sw3075B-ms98-a-0091 426.582625 429.691625 yeah we really hope hope so
sw3075B-ms98-a-0092 429.691625 431.259750 [silence]
sw3075B-ms98-a-0093 431.259750 432.742375 yeah
sw3075B-ms98-a-0094 432.742375 436.785125 [silence]
sw3075B-ms98-a-0095 436.785125 440.874750 well that that's that's pretty good that's pretty good
sw3075B-ms98-a-0096 440.874750 444.404375 [silence]
