sw3013A-ms98-a-0004 25.888375 40.920375 and it makes it so much easier and so you dump the rice you dump the chicken and then you put in fruit like pineapple and mandarin oranges and grape now grapes are the ones that you have to pull all that off but i get my kids to do that so [laughter] i- i don't have to do that
sw3013A-ms98-a-0005 40.920375 52.624375 and um and it really and you mix it all up with ye[ah]- there's a little dressing that goes in it that you have to stir up but it's so simple and it tastes really good because it's cool in the summertime uh-huh
sw3013A-ms98-a-0006 52.624375 57.489375 yeah it has to sit in the fridge over night but but it's really good

sw3013A-ms98-a-0048 217.996875 221.884875 uh yeah i don't like the run in and out part and
sw3013A-ms98-a-0049 221.884875 228.237500 i like to be able to sit down after school and have them talk with me an[d]- and my husband about what's happened and
sw3013A-ms98-a-0050 228.237500 234.150375 i think i that was ingrained in me during my family time at home and uh
sw3013A-ms98-a-0051 234.150375 238.257250 you know we could learn to talk about things and i think that's good
sw3013A-ms98-a-0052 238.257250 240.517375 [silence]
sw3013A-ms98-a-0053 240.517375 243.488750 yeah i think

sw3013A-ms98-a-0055 245.960000 250.163625 well that happens to us sometimes too uh [vocalized-noise]
sw3013A-ms98-a-0056 250.163625 259.769750 sometimes if something uh is on that they want to watch i leave it on but we eat in the kitchen and their heads are always poking past the door [laughter]
sw3013A-ms98-a-0057 259.769750 269.158875 yeah anyway food is is uh a real lifestyle kind of thing and i some people don't like to do this but i like to coo[k]- uh cook with my kids
sw3013A-ms98-a-0058 269.158875 281.062000 and if they're going to have other kids over then then they help and we make real simple things you know those oh i don't i don't know if you've ever made them maybe not since you don't have kids yet but those JELL-O
sw3013A-ms98-a-0059 281.062000 286.742875 uh gelatin things you can pick up with your fingers i can't think of what they call it
sw3013A-ms98-a-0060 286.742875 289.267750 yeah they're so simple
sw3013A-ms98-a-0061 289.267750 294.056625 and the kids love to do that uh finger food is is a biggie with them and
sw3013A-ms98-a-0062 294.056625 308.562125 [laughter] and like [laughter] now one thing i wish i could find a a better way to do are celery sticks and carrot sticks because they love to do that and it's just really hard and if they have to work with a knife i don't like that so
sw3013A-ms98-a-0063 308.562125 314.388500 that's uh they like to eat it but it's a hard one to have to to prepare
sw3013A-ms98-a-0064 314.388500 322.022500 but they like that with the the cool ranch dressing that goes along with that so yeah
sw3013A-ms98-a-0065 322.022500 323.193250 [silence]
sw3013A-ms98-a-0066 323.193250 327.356250 yeah my son's getting to be a a real good cook so uh
sw3013A-ms98-a-0067 327.356250 330.134125 sometimes he fixes me breakfast [laughter]
sw3013A-ms98-a-0068 330.134125 333.007625 [laughter] yeah i like it i like it a lot
sw3013A-ms98-a-0069 333.007625 334.352500 he's eleven
sw3013A-ms98-a-0070 334.352500 335.619375 uh-huh
sw3013A-ms98-a-0071 335.619375 338.100875 yeah so he's
sw3013A-ms98-a-0072 338.100875 339.601750 [silence]
sw3013A-ms98-a-0073 339.601750 342.584750 uh not every morning uh
sw3013A-ms98-a-0074 342.584750 350.783750 mostly during the summer it's hit and miss and we usually have like uh cold cereal or something like that um during the su[mmer]- during
sw3013A-ms98-a-0075 350.783750 363.047500 wintertime when they're in school um then i try to vary it so that we only eat that like a twice a twice a week or something and then have like when it's really cold
sw3013A-ms98-a-0076 363.047500 368.410500 i even cook oatmeal because i like oatmeal and the loo[k]- they like it all right and um
sw3013A-ms98-a-0077 368.410500 375.775250 then sometimes we do something it has to be fast because they're on their way to school we do like Eggo waffles and stuff like that but
sw3013A-ms98-a-0078 375.775250 377.519875 yeah
sw3013A-ms98-a-0079 377.519875 381.952000 so i try to uh and sometimes we do eggs if i get up
sw3013A-ms98-a-0080 381.952000 386.128125 early enough to do that i used to do them in the microwave but they don't like that
sw3013A-ms98-a-0081 386.128125 389.354000 uh um
sw3013A-ms98-a-0082 389.354000 392.959000 it de[pends]- it depends if you let them cook too long
sw3013A-ms98-a-0083 392.959000 400.444625 then they'll turn a little bit gray you can tell if they've gone to long because they'll turn a little bit gray and they will be a little harder and i don't like that
sw3013A-ms98-a-0084 400.444625 409.961000 so you have to just let it cook a little bit less than what it says in if you have a microwave book but uh you cook it a little bit less and then let it sit with a
sw3013A-ms98-a-0085 409.961000 416.101875 like a plate over the top and let it steam and then and then stir it up
sw3013A-ms98-a-0086 416.101875 424.114250 yeah an and that turns out okay and it's funny because_1 if i turn them out on to a di[sh]- i- on to like a plate for them to take what they want
sw3013A-ms98-a-0087 424.114250 427.171750 they don't know i've ever done it in a microwave [laughter]
sw3013A-ms98-a-0088 427.171750 432.601375 it's really funny it's very deceiving you know because_1 if they see it with their eyes they go uh i don't like want that
sw3013A-ms98-a-0089 432.601375 440.065250 you know and yet if they don't ever see it th[en]- then it's like oh this tastes okay you know so anyway
sw3013A-ms98-a-0090 440.065250 447.485625 [silence]
sw3013A-ms98-a-0091 447.485625 449.700625 yeah [laughter]
