sw3002A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.505375 [silence]
sw3002A-ms98-a-0002 0.505375 11.038625 well i usually keep up with news by watching ABC news on television and reading the papers here the local Dallas Morning News and then i also take the Wall Street Journal
sw3002A-ms98-a-0003 11.038625 19.253375 [silence]
sw3002A-ms98-a-0004 19.253375 29.851750 yeah well i well i d[id]- at the office i generally catch the Wall Street Journal at lunchtime i use part of my lunch period to uh read the Wall Street Journal
sw3002A-ms98-a-0005 29.851750 36.876875 then uh i read the the newspaper at home generally in the evening i'd rather sleep the extra thirty minutes in the morning
sw3002A-ms98-a-0006 36.876875 38.250125 [laughter]
sw3002A-ms98-a-0007 38.250125 68.486125 [silence]
sw3002A-ms98-a-0008 68.486125 80.236750 yeah that's uh what we do to it we're ne[ver]- never in home in time to really watch the six o'clock news on television so we catch the ten o'clock news but i catch the news on the radio coming
sw3002A-ms98-a-0009 80.236750 92.330375 to and from work but radio news is is rather short uh most of the news stations most of the stations here that are not all news stations you get about five minutes on the hour
sw3002A-ms98-a-0010 92.330375 98.225125 and if you catch the news stations uh you don't catch that much in the car [laughter]
sw3002A-ms98-a-0011 98.225125 100.673000 yeah but uh i
sw3002A-ms98-a-0012 100.673000 123.494875 [silence]
sw3002A-ms98-a-0013 123.494875 131.618750 yeah i have the same situation i tried the news magazines like Time Newsweek US News and World Report and
sw3002A-ms98-a-0014 131.618750 143.158750 they'd just stack up i wouldn't find time to read them you have to have time to sit down and concentrate on on the stories or e[lse]- all of a sudden you look and there's three uh three weeks worth laying on the coffee table
sw3002A-ms98-a-0015 143.158750 149.682375 and you wind up throwing them out without reading them because_1 it's too much trouble to try and catch up so
sw3002A-ms98-a-0016 149.682375 155.364750 have to depend i guess we're becoming more of a television oriented nation in that
sw3002A-ms98-a-0017 155.364750 165.040375 i don't think that uh my children even read newspapers other than the TV guide section [laughter-of] [laughter-the] there's is all uh strictly television news
sw3002A-ms98-a-0018 165.040375 168.712250 [silence]
sw3002A-ms98-a-0019 168.712250 170.031125 oh yeah
sw3002A-ms98-a-0020 170.031125 182.490375 [silence]
sw3002A-ms98-a-0021 182.490375 184.095875 yeah
sw3002A-ms98-a-0022 184.095875 193.602000 r[ight]- right it's the same thing with the news magazines like Time and and the other magazines it's hard to celebr[ate]- uh to celebrate to separate
sw3002A-ms98-a-0023 193.602000 202.021250 the news from the comment because in the way it's presented their opinions is printed or presented as being the news
sw3002A-ms98-a-0024 202.021250 206.195500 and so then you have to try and sort out what really is the news
sw3002A-ms98-a-0025 206.195500 223.149125 [silence]
sw3002A-ms98-a-0026 223.149125 225.775000 that's right that's
sw3002A-ms98-a-0027 225.775000 229.263375 [silence]
sw3002A-ms98-a-0028 229.263375 230.482875 [laughter-right]
sw3002A-ms98-a-0029 230.482875 239.803875 well so many of them also come through and they have discovered that this is the most popular issue of the time whether it be the homeless or uh
sw3002A-ms98-a-0030 239.803875 247.742625 cancer or whatever and then they devote uh an inordinate amount of time on the news cast to their personal axe to grind
sw3002A-ms98-a-0031 247.742625 254.297000 and uh i particularly the local television uh i know the the Wednesday's Child Bit 
sw3002A-ms98-a-0032 254.297000 264.454250 and they'll take up ten minutes of a newscast and leave out something i'm not saying that's not important but they leave out a real news issue to devote to one of their local pet projects
sw3002A-ms98-a-0033 264.454250 268.726875 [silence]
sw3002A-ms98-a-0034 268.726875 270.012500 [laughter-yes] so
sw3002A-ms98-a-0035 270.012500 279.993500 [silence]
sw3002A-ms98-a-0036 279.993500 284.015750 [laughter] that's yeah that makes sense we uh
sw3002A-ms98-a-0037 284.015750 295.158250 again like i say by the time i read the newspaper it's the the it's that morning's news from the day before and i'm reading it in the evening so i'm a i'm about a day behind most of the time anyway [laughter]
sw3002A-ms98-a-0038 295.158250 295.983750 [laughter]
