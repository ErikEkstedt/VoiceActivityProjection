sw3092B-ms98-a-0003 4.928750 7.136750 do you
sw3092B-ms98-a-0004 7.136750 9.043875 have i
sw3092B-ms98-a-0005 9.043875 13.279250 uh no not actually [laughter]
sw3092B-ms98-a-0006 13.279250 14.294250 okay
sw3092B-ms98-a-0007 14.294250 47.231875 [silence]
sw3092B-ms98-a-0008 47.231875 48.888625 right
sw3092B-ms98-a-0009 48.888625 62.123375 [silence]
sw3092B-ms98-a-0010 62.123375 63.594125 okay
sw3092B-ms98-a-0011 63.594125 65.263625 [silence]
sw3092B-ms98-a-0012 65.263625 66.331375 [noise]
sw3092B-ms98-a-0013 66.331375 82.462375 [silence]
sw3092B-ms98-a-0014 82.462375 85.478500 right i i think that
sw3092B-ms98-a-0015 85.478500 90.601625 job wise benefits are import[ant]- just as important as salary is
sw3092B-ms98-a-0016 90.601625 94.992625 [silence]
sw3092B-ms98-a-0017 94.992625 101.543625 exactly exactly especially when you have a family with children and you are always going to the doctor for
sw3092B-ms98-a-0018 101.543625 102.852125 [silence]
sw3092B-ms98-a-0019 102.852125 103.951750 exactly
sw3092B-ms98-a-0020 103.951750 105.789375 they always do
sw3092B-ms98-a-0021 105.789375 118.465375 [silence]
sw3092B-ms98-a-0022 118.465375 126.296875 yeah i think any any even if your insurance policy is not the greatest
sw3092B-ms98-a-0023 126.296875 131.329625 exactly you [vocalized-noise] you wouldn't be pulling it out of your account all of the time
sw3092B-ms98-a-0024 131.329625 136.001375 just by yourself also [noise] for working women
sw3092B-ms98-a-0025 136.001375 143.571500 uh i think a lot of the companies should start providing for day care in the in the in the building
sw3092B-ms98-a-0026 143.571500 165.612125 [silence]
sw3092B-ms98-a-0027 165.612125 167.462000 right
sw3092B-ms98-a-0028 167.462000 171.637625 [silence]
sw3092B-ms98-a-0029 171.637625 172.795250 yeah
sw3092B-ms98-a-0030 172.795250 174.780125 like i[n]- in may case
sw3092B-ms98-a-0031 174.780125 176.568000 i have three children
sw3092B-ms98-a-0032 176.568000 186.914375 from ages nine to two and it it's just unfeasible for me to try to get a job because all the money that i would be making would be going to day care
sw3092B-ms98-a-0033 186.914375 195.137500 and it it would be just basically be me working to pay for them to be at a day care center which is not right exactly
sw3092B-ms98-a-0034 195.137500 196.585625 [silence]
sw3092B-ms98-a-0035 196.585625 209.238875 besides which it would be easier uh there's a lot of single mothers out there now from divorces and a lot of women are starting to have babies without a partner and to go to work
sw3092B-ms98-a-0036 209.238875 216.797750 you are worried about your child besides which you have to get up earlier to take the child to day care and if they were in the same building
sw3092B-ms98-a-0037 216.797750 224.910500 then you are going to the same place and you could go for your lunch hour down and visit with your child or you know and take your breaks with your children or something
sw3092B-ms98-a-0038 224.910500 234.393250 [silence]
sw3092B-ms98-a-0039 234.393250 247.824875 i think tha[t]- i think it would be fair i think if if the company could not provide it all on their own for the for the people that would be using it you know a a a certain amount of their salary would go to it but it would still probably be cheaper
sw3092B-ms98-a-0040 247.824875 252.343875 with the company helping our if everybody you know pulled their own weight in it
sw3092B-ms98-a-0041 252.343875 254.094500 [silence]
sw3092B-ms98-a-0042 254.094500 256.562625 i think it would be really really great
sw3092B-ms98-a-0043 256.562625 257.741125 yeah
sw3092B-ms98-a-0044 257.741125 258.809000 i do
sw3092B-ms98-a-0045 258.809000 264.861625 [silence]
sw3092B-ms98-a-0046 264.861625 270.926625 eye care is good i don't i'm not sure i don't think we have that on our policy
sw3092B-ms98-a-0047 270.926625 273.310500 but uh we
sw3092B-ms98-a-0048 273.310500 274.749750 yeah
sw3092B-ms98-a-0049 274.749750 276.980750 it would be great i mean
sw3092B-ms98-a-0050 276.980750 281.718750 the glasses that the exams themselves are not expensive it's the glasses
sw3092B-ms98-a-0051 281.718750 283.375625 [silence]
sw3092B-ms98-a-0052 283.375625 285.126625 yeah that's true
sw3092B-ms98-a-0053 285.126625 288.144000 [silence]
sw3092B-ms98-a-0054 288.144000 290.265750 right now like my
sw3092B-ms98-a-0055 290.265750 291.986625 right
sw3092B-ms98-a-0056 291.986625 296.107875 well like my mother she has to go for testing cause she has got
sw3092B-ms98-a-0057 296.107875 305.384000 well she does not have it but she is like on the verge of it or something her eyes are changing and she has to be tested periodically and and those are expensive tests
sw3092B-ms98-a-0058 305.384000 311.333375 now i think your insurance covers her on that but you know for something like that
sw3092B-ms98-a-0059 311.333375 315.981625 it that that's just as bad as a medical you know that that
sw3092B-ms98-a-0060 315.981625 317.653375 [silence]
sw3092B-ms98-a-0061 317.653375 318.729375 right
sw3092B-ms98-a-0062 318.729375 330.333625 [silence]
sw3092B-ms98-a-0063 330.333625 331.914875 right
sw3092B-ms98-a-0064 331.914875 332.960000 [silence]
sw3092B-ms98-a-0065 332.960000 336.921000 now i i would like to see [bettle/better] better dental insurance
sw3092B-ms98-a-0066 336.921000 339.293000 to me was that our beep
sw3092B-ms98-a-0067 339.293000 340.507375 [silence]
sw3092B-ms98-a-0068 340.507375 341.753250 oh huh
sw3092B-ms98-a-0069 341.753250 346.092250 [silence]
sw3092B-ms98-a-0070 346.092250 350.189375 okay but with with the three children
sw3092B-ms98-a-0071 350.189375 355.050250 um orthopedic care um not orthopedic orthodontic care
sw3092B-ms98-a-0072 355.050250 363.404875 because on on a lot of the dental insurances they don't cover that well for the the orthodontal stuff
sw3092B-ms98-a-0073 363.404875 366.535625 [silence]
sw3092B-ms98-a-0074 366.535625 367.863875 yes it is
sw3092B-ms98-a-0075 367.863875 371.162125 [silence]
sw3092B-ms98-a-0076 371.162125 372.378000 uh-huh
sw3092B-ms98-a-0077 372.378000 380.536500 [silence]
sw3092B-ms98-a-0078 380.536500 381.830125 right
sw3092B-ms98-a-0079 381.830125 389.696250 [silence]
sw3092B-ms98-a-0080 389.696250 390.914875 yeah
sw3092B-ms98-a-0081 390.914875 395.180875 [silence]
sw3092B-ms98-a-0082 395.180875 401.427750 right my middle child needs to have uh orthodontic he's because his his pallet is
sw3092B-ms98-a-0083 401.427750 403.544125 squared not rounded
sw3092B-ms98-a-0084 403.544125 407.184750 and it affects his speech a little bit not not anything you know
sw3092B-ms98-a-0085 407.184750 416.086875 right but just enough that his bite is off a little bit and it's like four hundred dollars and my insurance is only going to cover like fifty of it
sw3092B-ms98-a-0086 416.086875 427.695625 [silence]
sw3092B-ms98-a-0087 427.695625 428.815875 oh
sw3092B-ms98-a-0088 428.815875 433.029875 [silence]
sw3092B-ms98-a-0089 433.029875 434.036000 really
sw3092B-ms98-a-0090 434.036000 436.673625 that sounds like it would hurt more
sw3092B-ms98-a-0091 436.673625 442.221750 [silence]
sw3092B-ms98-a-0092 442.221750 450.556250 oh gosh i i would much rather that do that to myself than make my five year old [laughter-go] [laughter-in] and do it that would kill me
