sw3064B-ms98-a-0087 411.759000 416.596000 but uh and i can remember before we had kids we did that a lot but it was no biggie
sw3064B-ms98-a-0088 416.596000 424.752500 you know because_1 we could pay it off while after kids and you're paying child care and other things all of a sudden it's not so easy to pay off so we cut that out real quick [laughter]
sw3064B-ms98-a-0089 424.752500 426.237250 and uh
sw3064B-ms98-a-0090 426.237250 433.764250 but i- i do like having them_1 there there is a bit of security in having the credit cards and knowing that in times of crisis they are there to use
sw3064B-ms98-a-0091 433.764250 441.731750 but you have to have a very good sense of saving and or common sense not not to get yourself in trouble
