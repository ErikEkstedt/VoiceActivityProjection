sw3064A-ms98-a-0052 239.215375 249.725750 you only get half of that paid for the principal so i'm looking at three or four years before my balances are cleared on those charge accounts now as the monthly payment
sw3064A-ms98-a-0053 249.725750 254.124875 uh i mean as the monthly payment amount goes down
sw3064A-ms98-a-0054 254.124875 265.534625 that will free up more cash where i can continue to make the larger payments uh as long as i don't have a major disaster where i have to use it again i can i can do that
sw3064A-ms98-a-0055 265.534625 273.157875 meantime though i'm not building any reserves anything that i could be put aside into savings is going for interest on those cards
