sw3074B-ms98-a-0053 308.237875 318.005625 mean what we throw away is is a ransom a king's ransom to most people and i and even to people in our country who scavenge for food and
sw3074B-ms98-a-0054 318.005625 321.582750 and and i i think you have to

sw3074B-ms98-a-0056 329.664750 342.565625 [vocalized-noise] that have all that they need and all that they could want that they've got to be careful uh this is uh i this is why i thought Jimmy Carter was never very po[pular]- eh very pos[itive]- [vocalized-noise] you know
sw3074B-ms98-a-0057 342.565625 344.483250 people didn't like him
sw3074B-ms98-a-0058 344.483250 346.168625 because he
sw3074B-ms98-a-0059 346.168625 355.144750 tried to say turn off the lights [laughter] conserve this do that and and uh the pe[ople]- i nobody wanted to hear it

sw3074B-ms98-a-0079 408.536750 416.430125 i i think the big question too we're looking at is would you be willing to pay more for a product so it can be recycled
sw3074B-ms98-a-0080 416.430125 418.022625 it um
sw3074B-ms98-a-0081 418.022625 421.495750 that's that's right and and uh
sw3074B-ms98-a-0082 421.495750 425.856375 do we have to wait until all the landfills are full
sw3074B-ms98-a-0083 425.856375 432.398875 and there is nowhere else to put our garbage or and i don't with the mind set
sw3074B-ms98-a-0084 432.398875 439.386625 of the American public i think what they will do is start paying Mexico to take our trash
sw3074B-ms98-a-0085 439.386625 441.852875 that isn't that isn't harmful
sw3074B-ms98-a-0086 441.852875 445.006250 or they will go dump it out in the middle of some ocean
sw3074B-ms98-a-0087 445.006250 449.551000 that's the way we solve problems and it's sad
