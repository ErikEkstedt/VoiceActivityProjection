sw3074A-ms98-a-0011 32.223375 34.686500 i guess that's going to happen
sw3074A-ms98-a-0012 34.686500 38.429750 yeah a really good effort that's right yeah
sw3074A-ms98-a-0013 38.429750 46.190125 well i was thinking about the other day um when i when Dick and i were oh many many years ago when we were first married and he was in graduate school in Missouri
sw3074A-ms98-a-0014 46.190125 54.147625 um i went oh i was probably this was probably see it [vocalized-noise] been like nineteen sixty seven or sixty eight um
sw3074A-ms98-a-0015 54.147625 66.901750 we i went to a meeting and uh one of the the speakers at the meeting was a woman who was recycling and um she was from Saint Louis and she had this fantastic um family effort in in recycling
sw3074A-ms98-a-0016 66.901750 76.738000 and she was dividing her colored glass and her plastics and her aluminum and i thought wow i mean how one person is doing that you know but my my thought was
sw3074A-ms98-a-0017 76.738000 88.370250 it's a shame i mean it's wonderful that she's doing it and it but wouldn't it be mu[ch]- much nicer if we all did it because her effort would have really um really uh been a good example for all of us
sw3074A-ms98-a-0018 88.370250 98.509875 and yet you know and we were just sort of talking about it at the time and here we are you know now we're doing it on a city wide basis in in communities so it's wonderful that we've come that far i think but
sw3074A-ms98-a-0019 98.509875 101.915875 [silence]
sw3074A-ms98-a-0020 101.915875 103.384500 um
sw3074A-ms98-a-0021 103.384500 113.261250 i think she was i was trying to remember it seems to me that she was doing it on her own and living in Saint Louis there were places where she could actually take her uh things herself
sw3074A-ms98-a-0022 113.261250 119.772750 uh and so it wasn't you know wasn't something that was being picked up or um and i think she was encouraging other people to do it if they would
sw3074A-ms98-a-0023 119.772750 130.119750 but i remember her saying yes i have a trash can for this and a trash can for that and a trash can for the other thing and [laughter] i thought wow that's that is wonderful that somebody is doing th[at]- does that yeah

sw3074A-ms98-a-0056 219.261375 229.200250 for instance she she would take the waxed paper out of a cereal box and use that for you know when she made cookies it would go on that or if she needed to wrap something for needed uh sandwich paper or something she'd use that
sw3074A-ms98-a-0057 229.200250 238.202250 she just she recycles everything and i have done the same thing i recycle like zip lock bags and things like that my kids get the biggest kick out of that although
sw3074A-ms98-a-0058 238.202250 245.509250 they do the same thing [laughter] i mean they i think they give me a hard time but i think they know that [laughter-that's] it's the right way [laughter]

sw3074A-ms98-a-0069 287.382125 294.894875 do your part you know people are not you you you can't be waited on all your life and expect things to always ha[ve]- ah work ou[t]- out

sw3074A-ms98-a-0095 368.252000 370.724375 um i don't know it's
sw3074A-ms98-a-0096 370.724375 384.674500 uh [noise] it's just really interesting to me how now more aware of things i am than i even myself than i used to be a few years ago i mean like i i'd go to the um to the UTD um cafeteria for lunch sometimes
sw3074A-ms98-a-0097 384.674500 389.081250 and they use styrofoam plates when they wouldn't need to use styrofoam plates
sw3074A-ms98-a-0098 389.081250 396.105000 you know and i think to myself that's that's crazy i wonder if you know maybe i need to bring that to someone's attention you know and and
sw3074A-ms98-a-0099 396.105000 409.361750 uh i'm seeing more and more of that and and i think it's uh just McDonald's effort to reduce the number of of styrofoam uh boxes that they use for hamburgers and stuff i think is a good good example you know that even industry is willing to do it
