sw3086B-ms98-a-0043 218.990625 231.080000 and after a while the modem started making noises on its own without uh even without using it on the computer i could turn a computer on it'd start squawking so i finally opened up the box and took it out

sw3086B-ms98-a-0067 378.312250 389.401125 i can understand that very easily i've used uh i've had a class on um R Base and also in Paradox and both of those seem very easy to use compared to D Base
