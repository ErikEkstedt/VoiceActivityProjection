sw3086A-ms98-a-0009 29.471500 35.500250 um well i sort of own a computer we have two PCs at home but neither one do we really own
sw3086A-ms98-a-0010 35.500250 41.309875 um both are no both of them are sort of work related and
sw3086A-ms98-a-0011 41.309875 44.973500 yeah [laughter] that's the nicer way right of
sw3086A-ms98-a-0012 44.973500 58.439500 no no um i actually i'm doing consulting right now because i just had a baby and my husband's working at Bell Labs but he's really from France and these computers actually are from France
sw3086A-ms98-a-0013 58.439500 61.830750 [vocalized-noise] um one of them's a Compaq 
sw3086A-ms98-a-0014 61.830750 64.057000 it's a three eighty six
sw3086A-ms98-a-0015 64.057000 68.488000 [laughter] and the other is actually a
sw3086A-ms98-a-0016 68.488000 72.521375 IBM PC compatible it's a three eighty six
sw3086A-ms98-a-0017 72.521375 74.925750 guess it's twenty five
sw3086A-ms98-a-0018 74.925750 78.033875 [silence]
sw3086A-ms98-a-0019 78.033875 86.344500 yeah three eight six twenty five C maybe i don't know no we don't have the cash that's right we decided not to get the cash which is actually another loaner one too that we've picked up
sw3086A-ms98-a-0020 86.344500 90.752500 for a consulting job that my husband was doing [noise] and
sw3086A-ms98-a-0021 90.752500 98.996625 um well i actually do some work working at MIT and at NIST National Institute of Standards and Technology
sw3086A-ms98-a-0022 98.996625 101.933500 in Washington and then i worked for Dragon Systems

sw3086A-ms98-a-0025 105.576625 109.900500 um well it depends it's very different in the different places
sw3086A-ms98-a-0026 109.900500 111.353375 but
sw3086A-ms98-a-0027 111.353375 115.983000 [noise] yeah yeah program related research related i've
sw3086A-ms98-a-0028 115.983000 121.707000 i work in s[peech]- the speech field and i- i do a lot about acoustics phonetics and
sw3086A-ms98-a-0029 121.707000 128.464750 looking at the the uh acoustic characteristics of speech and so i do that type of stuff typically 
sw3086A-ms98-a-0030 128.464750 136.758750 for other people and we use uh here we use the PCs to do that and mostly i use it for writing papers and things like that
sw3086A-ms98-a-0031 136.758750 138.002875 [silence]
sw3086A-ms98-a-0032 138.002875 141.592875 [vocalized-noise] well more uh do you know Latek
sw3086A-ms98-a-0033 141.592875 150.864375 word t[ext]- word text processing so i don't i don't use [vocalized-noise] i mean you can call it word processing but i don't usually use a word processor to do it
sw3086A-ms98-a-0034 150.864375 155.716000 and we don't have too much standard software like i haven't bought
sw3086A-ms98-a-0035 155.716000 169.291000 we haven't really bought any commercially available software at all so we don't use it for things like our accounts and addresses and things like that we use it more for just writing programs when we need to
sw3086A-ms98-a-0036 169.291000 171.704500 or um
sw3086A-ms98-a-0037 171.704500 176.182875 doing research looking at the speech signal and then doing writing
sw3086A-ms98-a-0038 176.182875 177.427875 [silence]
sw3086A-ms98-a-0039 177.427875 179.716625 [vocalized-noise] and also as [laughter-a]
sw3086A-ms98-a-0040 179.716625 184.505750 just as a terminal and we connect to other computers to read our net mail and things like that

sw3086A-ms98-a-0042 185.639625 189.253500 uh neither one has a modem but we have a modem

sw3086A-ms98-a-0058 234.657625 237.343375 oh i didn't hear it
sw3086A-ms98-a-0059 237.343375 240.526625 do you hear the the beep in the background
sw3086A-ms98-a-0060 240.526625 244.610750 oh that's a an ambulance or something going on here i think
sw3086A-ms98-a-0061 244.610750 248.391000 [vocalized-noise] i haven't ever noticed the thirty second warning actually 
sw3086A-ms98-a-0062 248.391000 250.256375 in Manhattan

sw3086A-ms98-a-0066 254.307750 266.297875 uh-huh so it'd be interesting for the people that look at this signal [laughter-i] [laughter-mean] because there's a lot of background noise that you know people can hear so it'll be interesting how much of it actually gets picked up um
sw3086A-ms98-a-0067 266.297875 280.836250 yeah and often times that i can't talk on th[e]- can't do this much later than now between sort of like six five thirty and six thirty or something like that because the traffic outside they honk the horn so loud i can't even hear the phone conversation
sw3086A-ms98-a-0068 280.836250 283.588375 uh about twenty after four
