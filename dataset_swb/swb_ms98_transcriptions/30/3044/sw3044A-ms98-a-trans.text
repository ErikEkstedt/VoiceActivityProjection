sw3044A-ms98-a-0022 63.094000 64.740250 right right
sw3044A-ms98-a-0023 64.740250 75.395000 well we have we just moved in and we're uh kind of our yard has been left untended mostly for about_1 six years so there's a lot of clover growing in it and everything
sw3044A-ms98-a-0024 75.395000 82.701000 [noise] and uh so we're trying to do is k[ill]- to to kill back all the weeds and the clover and let so the grass can grow
sw3044A-ms98-a-0025 82.701000 93.820250 and a number of the bushes uh there's a lot of boxwood bushes and all that were overgrown so we had to trim those all back you know to to nice and round because they were kind of sticking out all over the sidewalk and everything
sw3044A-ms98-a-0026 93.820250 103.451750 and there was some uh so[me]- juniper that was uh absolutely huge covering up half the driveway just about so we had to cut it all back so you can park the two cars in it
sw3044A-ms98-a-0027 103.451750 117.664375 and uh mostly what we're doing since we got a yard service to our lawn service to help fertilize uh seed aerate the lawns uh so that uh you know we can get it back up to speed and t[o]- and and to get
sw3044A-ms98-a-0028 117.664375 121.077500 get it all green again and i was gonna wa[tch]- what i was gonna to do is watch them_1
sw3044A-ms98-a-0029 121.077500 127.702000 throughout the year and see what kind of fertilizer they use and uh then i'd just repeat it from then on myself
sw3044A-ms98-a-0030 127.702000 139.666250 and uh we're also kind of looking at uh a little bit of landscaping as far as putting some uh azaleas in with uh you know different white azaleas and red azaleas and purple azaleas you know to give a little color into the
sw3044A-ms98-a-0031 139.666250 141.432625 into the landscape there
sw3044A-ms98-a-0032 141.432625 150.350500 and uh you know put a couple of plants around our deck in the back and a couple in the front with the existing plants uh to give a little color and everything
sw3044A-ms98-a-0033 150.350500 153.086125 uh do you do anything like that or
sw3044A-ms98-a-0034 153.086125 155.202875 [silence]
sw3044A-ms98-a-0035 155.202875 156.398750 um-hum

sw3044A-ms98-a-0039 167.374500 168.917625 um-hum
sw3044A-ms98-a-0040 168.917625 178.495625 [noise] you know some of the things that i've seen around here too is that a lot of people uh there's kind of two ways to to that i've seen to cheaply fertilize your yard
sw3044A-ms98-a-0041 178.495625 183.354250 and one was to uh i guess a big thing around is a called a composter
sw3044A-ms98-a-0042 183.354250 185.165500 you know where you have you heard of that 
sw3044A-ms98-a-0043 185.165500 193.819125 oh yeah whether you you know you put your whatever different grass clippings and all that in and and you let it sit there for a while and it kind of cooks or something a[s]- as it decomposes
sw3044A-ms98-a-0044 193.819125 203.855125 and we sort of have one by guess by accident that's in our backyard and so we're thinking about using some of that to spread around you know the the the bush beds and flower beds and stuff
sw3044A-ms98-a-0045 203.855125 211.476375 but another thing that uh one of my neighbors is doing and it it his yard looks really good is that he's not using any of the he's not collecting any of the um
sw3044A-ms98-a-0046 211.476375 220.071250 uh the the uh grass that he mows up at all he just let's it sit right back into the grass you know doesn't collect it in a bag or anything
sw3044A-ms98-a-0047 220.071250 224.061250 and by doing that i guess it sort of acts like it's own fertilizer
sw3044A-ms98-a-0048 224.061250 229.110125 and uh it just makes the grass real thick and and green and everything and it doesn't cost anything
sw3044A-ms98-a-0049 229.110125 239.052500 [silence]
sw3044A-ms98-a-0050 239.052500 241.491500 oh you mean so that's a separate blade
sw3044A-ms98-a-0051 241.491500 243.519750 [silence]
sw3044A-ms98-a-0052 243.519750 244.695250 uh-huh

sw3044A-ms98-a-0054 247.634000 254.736375 uh-huh do you think that that's like uh a blade that you can put on any mower or is it a special lawn mower the whole thing
sw3044A-ms98-a-0055 254.736375 255.758750 [silence]
