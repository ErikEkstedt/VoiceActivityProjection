sw3036A-ms98-a-0008 17.302375 18.327375 [silence]
sw3036A-ms98-a-0009 18.327375 21.403375 uh are you from Texas
sw3036A-ms98-a-0010 21.403375 23.583875 not orig[inally]- where you from 
sw3036A-ms98-a-0011 23.583875 29.068250 Georgia okay well see i'm i'm from Chicago so [laughter]
sw3036A-ms98-a-0012 29.068250 34.931125 uh i'm kind of in a different category here uh
sw3036A-ms98-a-0013 34.931125 36.517625 [silence]
sw3036A-ms98-a-0014 36.517625 46.002500 uh i would probably go with it's tough uh
sw3036A-ms98-a-0015 46.002500 52.725375 i think i would just stick with the classics only because uh
sw3036A-ms98-a-0016 52.725375 57.183125 i like music just for music's sake and
sw3036A-ms98-a-0017 57.183125 68.073875 uh you know i'm from the era where you know we had all the rock and roll i'm forty so i'm you know part of that whole deal and uh
sw3036A-ms98-a-0018 68.073875 78.992375 that was a real interesting time and you know the music sort of made the whole time very rich with sound uh
sw3036A-ms98-a-0019 78.992375 85.246750 but i think i'd stick back with my Beethoven and my Bach and my [laughter-Mozart] 
sw3036A-ms98-a-0020 85.246750 100.231750 i mean because it's just it will always be there it's classic and i don't have to worry about you know what's current and what's not because i haven't been current with music for a long time but you know same 
sw3036A-ms98-a-0021 100.231750 112.530375 um and as far as country music is i've never really uh listened to it i mean because that's just it was it wasn't part of what i knew so
sw3036A-ms98-a-0022 112.530375 114.560125 there you go [laughter]

sw3036A-ms98-a-0027 134.898250 142.016250 i it's it's a different perspective on everything too i i know well whenever they talk about uh
sw3036A-ms98-a-0028 142.016250 149.678125 country music it's about it seems sad to me it's always about some guy losing some girl and then
sw3036A-ms98-a-0029 149.678125 152.954625 you know playing the guitar and singing about it [laughter]

sw3036A-ms98-a-0048 210.686750 213.433375 let's see well i guess i i have
sw3036A-ms98-a-0049 213.433375 224.025750 listened in on some of the stuff and not really realized it that i do like some of that uh Dolly Parton she's kind of is she kind of country
sw3036A-ms98-a-0050 224.025750 226.290125 kind of [laughter]
sw3036A-ms98-a-0051 226.290125 228.176250 right down there
sw3036A-ms98-a-0052 228.176250 229.330000 um
sw3036A-ms98-a-0053 229.330000 232.011500 uh how about the Oak Ridge Boys
sw3036A-ms98-a-0054 232.011500 238.349375 very much okay well i like them too so i guess i've had a smattering and i just uh
sw3036A-ms98-a-0055 238.349375 244.906625 you know picked i've picked up a little bit along the way that i probably wouldn't have if i'd stayed up north you know [laughter]
sw3036A-ms98-a-0056 244.906625 255.105125 [laughter] you know so well i think there's music all around anyway i mean i think life is just music so you know you can hear it wherever you want and uh
sw3036A-ms98-a-0057 255.105125 268.540375 and i've i've kind of shied away from some of the new stuff because i just don't understand it but maybe twenty years from now they'll look at it as classic rock and roll which i really like so
sw3036A-ms98-a-0058 268.540375 275.786250 [silence]
sw3036A-ms98-a-0059 275.786250 278.855000 yeah the greatest hits right [laughter-yeah]
sw3036A-ms98-a-0060 278.855000 284.311875 yeah so i mean it it it'll if it stands the test of time we'll see
sw3036A-ms98-a-0061 284.311875 295.528000 and uh then it'll if it survives then it'll just probably be one or two songs that sort of hey listen what we listened [laughter-to] can you believe this sort of thing but 
sw3036A-ms98-a-0062 295.528000 307.913875 uh you know i i think of i get real tickled when i listen to some of the old Beatle uh music you know the orchestration of it and that it's so popular still and 
sw3036A-ms98-a-0063 307.913875 317.541750 and uh you know all these rocks rock stations call it classic soft rock you know [laughter] but we used to listen to it full blast [laughter]
sw3036A-ms98-a-0064 317.541750 325.944875 yeah so it's kind of funny the way we listened to the stuff but i don't know well you got any more
