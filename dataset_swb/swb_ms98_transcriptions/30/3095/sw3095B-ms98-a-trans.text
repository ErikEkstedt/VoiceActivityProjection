sw3095B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 8.749875 [silence]
sw3095B-ms98-a-0002 8.749875 12.363875 yes i did it's it's uh the uh
sw3095B-ms98-a-0003 12.363875 25.989250 maybe i'm a hard liner but i think that there should be some preset penalties in criminal cases rather than uh degrees of 
sw3095B-ms98-a-0004 25.989250 28.812250 sentencing
sw3095B-ms98-a-0005 28.812250 39.360375 right right uh again having participated in jury duty myself i know [laughter] i know how such a diverse group of
sw3095B-ms98-a-0006 39.360375 53.498125 people get together the different backgrounds different ideas that sometimes you can have one person or two that can hold up what i consider the proper sentencing of the p[erson]- person
sw3095B-ms98-a-0007 53.498125 55.408375 yes ma'am
sw3095B-ms98-a-0008 55.408375 121.375250 [silence]
sw3095B-ms98-a-0009 121.375250 131.539625 [laughter] no problem yes yeah um i think what you have is the way the
sw3095B-ms98-a-0010 131.539625 142.540000 the justice system works is they bend over backwards trying to protect the guilty so many things in their back pardon yes i know
sw3095B-ms98-a-0011 142.540000 145.750750 my wife participated in a jury trial
sw3095B-ms98-a-0012 145.750750 153.553750 several years back wherein the individual after it was over and they had came up with the maximum sentence
sw3095B-ms98-a-0013 153.553750 165.145875 in the jury form they found out that uh the gentleman involved had a long history of the same type offense which was theft of uh property
sw3095B-ms98-a-0014 165.145875 174.991125 and yet the dist[rict]- the attorney for the prosecution could not enter these uh the good man's background into it it was like this was a first time offender
sw3095B-ms98-a-0015 174.991125 183.606125 whereas uh i think that's those that should be in jail should be in jail [laughter]
sw3095B-ms98-a-0016 183.606125 190.897375 [silence]
sw3095B-ms98-a-0017 190.897375 191.921125 yeah
sw3095B-ms98-a-0018 191.921125 208.176125 [silence]
sw3095B-ms98-a-0019 208.176125 217.348625 well i think this is one of the reasons that also that attorneys have such a a unsavory reputation shall we say
sw3095B-ms98-a-0020 217.348625 222.528000 [silence]
sw3095B-ms98-a-0021 222.528000 224.211250 yeah
sw3095B-ms98-a-0022 224.211250 232.521875 well what you got is the situation wherein uh if you ever get in trouble you want to hire the smartest crookedest lawyer you can find
sw3095B-ms98-a-0023 232.521875 243.399000 and uh that's not the idea it's the idea is not to get the guy off of the crime that he committed but to punish him for the crime he committed
sw3095B-ms98-a-0024 243.399000 247.627125 [silence]
sw3095B-ms98-a-0025 247.627125 248.127250 yeah
sw3095B-ms98-a-0026 248.127250 255.101750 [noise]
sw3095B-ms98-a-0027 255.101750 267.671375 well we have uh a situation again that i am familiar with where uh the son of an acquaintance of mine was killed while trying to stop a robbery 
sw3095B-ms98-a-0028 267.671375 277.723250 and the person that killed him was a young woman who had left the house with full intent to commit crimes carrying a gun in her purse
sw3095B-ms98-a-0029 277.723250 280.400750 and anyway
sw3095B-ms98-a-0030 280.400750 290.824875 it'd get to the she was sentenced to jail but then due to technicalities she was going to be out of jail within eighteen months after she was sentenced
sw3095B-ms98-a-0031 290.824875 296.663500 of course it took eighteen months for the thing the trial to happen so
sw3095B-ms98-a-0032 296.663500 310.378500 then uh there was a letter writing campaign that went in [noise] and the parole board received approximately a thousand letters protesting putting this person back on the street within eighteen months after killing someone
sw3095B-ms98-a-0033 310.378500 322.617250 and uh fortunately it worked they uh elimi[nated]- they corrected the technicality and the person now will have to serve three to four years of the seven or eight they were sentenced to
sw3095B-ms98-a-0034 322.617250 324.971875 [noise]
sw3095B-ms98-a-0035 324.971875 342.121625 [silence]
sw3095B-ms98-a-0036 342.121625 342.981750 right
sw3095B-ms98-a-0037 342.981750 344.590750 [noise]
sw3095B-ms98-a-0038 344.590750 347.303250 this is it and most people don't take the time
sw3095B-ms98-a-0039 347.303250 353.970750 and again the only reason [noise] i took the time is because i was personally acquainted with these people i'm just as guilty as the rest in that respect
sw3095B-ms98-a-0040 353.970750 360.213750 [silence]
sw3095B-ms98-a-0041 360.213750 368.369750 oh yes well they again the and i'm not knocking the civil rights program or anything like that but we've gone
sw3095B-ms98-a-0042 368.369750 379.269250 overboard to uh protect persons from being having their civil rights violated to the point where the person that is damaged is not
sw3095B-ms98-a-0043 379.269250 385.034625 protected it's again the victim gets worse punishment then the person that commits the crimes
sw3095B-ms98-a-0044 385.034625 387.094250 [silence]
sw3095B-ms98-a-0045 387.094250 387.579625 yeah
sw3095B-ms98-a-0046 387.579625 388.716875 [noise]
sw3095B-ms98-a-0047 388.716875 394.560125 okay [laughter] i think we're both in agreement on this subject [laughter]
sw3095B-ms98-a-0048 394.560125 411.426625 [silence]
sw3095B-ms98-a-0049 411.426625 414.287375 yeah [noise]
sw3095B-ms98-a-0050 414.287375 421.303875 [silence]
sw3095B-ms98-a-0051 421.303875 422.193750 yeah
sw3095B-ms98-a-0052 422.193750 427.360500 [silence]
sw3095B-ms98-a-0053 427.360500 428.485000 yeah
sw3095B-ms98-a-0054 428.485000 438.332250 well another side of the coin that with our justice system there are a lot of frivolous cases that go to court there are a lot of things that could be settled out of court
sw3095B-ms98-a-0055 438.332250 442.210500 which uh or should never have gone to court
sw3095B-ms98-a-0056 442.210500 446.172875 and then the amazing thing of course is how uh
sw3095B-ms98-a-0057 446.172875 450.637000 some cases can come to trial in thirty days and others it takes eighteen months
