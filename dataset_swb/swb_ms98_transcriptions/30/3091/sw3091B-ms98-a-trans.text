sw3091B-ms98-a-0011 49.464500 56.689750 but it's good home style Italian cooking it's not the fancy veal and things that you get at some of the other Italian restaurants
sw3091B-ms98-a-0012 56.689750 61.186375 they make excellent spaghetti sauce and little garlic rolls and things like that
sw3091B-ms98-a-0013 61.186375 62.592000 [silence]

sw3091B-ms98-a-0019 81.834375 92.275750 yes there's an excellent uh i guess it's Tai it's one of the Southeast Asian type restaurants down in Deep Elm uh West Wind or
sw3091B-ms98-a-0020 92.275750 93.462125 yeah
sw3091B-ms98-a-0021 93.462125 97.025000 [silence]
sw3091B-ms98-a-0022 97.025000 103.028000 yes i believe so i am really not sure exactly what style it is but it's very very good
sw3091B-ms98-a-0023 103.028000 116.078250 now right in the edge of North Dallas there at uh Skillman just north of LBJ there's another Vietnamese type restaurant called Yoli's Y O L I S
sw3091B-ms98-a-0024 116.078250 120.368875 which uh serves some excellent food too in that in that style of food
sw3091B-ms98-a-0025 120.368875 124.079750 it's not a fancy place i've eaten their lunch primarily [laughter]
sw3091B-ms98-a-0026 124.079750 128.078750 [silence]
sw3091B-ms98-a-0027 128.078750 134.369500 oh that's hard to say but the ones that we like most are out of business now but

sw3091B-ms98-a-0029 135.476375 136.617375 um
sw3091B-ms98-a-0030 136.617375 143.973750 right but Papillon is one we go back to quite frequently for uh continental style cooking
