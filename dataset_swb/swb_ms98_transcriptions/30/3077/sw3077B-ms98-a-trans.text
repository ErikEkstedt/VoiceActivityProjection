sw3077B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 9.675750 American[s]- Americans like me and whether or not uh uh uh not i think that we're paying too much taxes um that including taxes in general or income tax
sw3077B-ms98-a-0002 9.675750 16.118750 and um [noise] the other thing was do we get what we pay for i mean what what is our what is our opinion on that so
sw3077B-ms98-a-0003 16.118750 17.252500 [silence]
sw3077B-ms98-a-0004 17.252500 21.437000 are you prepared to talk [laughter] let me push
sw3077B-ms98-a-0005 21.437000 23.768875 [laughter] let me push one here [laughter]
sw3077B-ms98-a-0006 23.768875 25.010500 [noise]
sw3077B-ms98-a-0007 25.010500 34.071625 okay um well i can just tell you a little bit about taxes in Texas it's most interesting because we're one of the few if i don't know of any other state
sw3077B-ms98-a-0008 34.071625 47.412250 um does not have a state income tax and so we don't have a state income tax but we certainly make up for it in other ways here um for instance the local um sales tax is eight and a quarter percent
sw3077B-ms98-a-0009 47.412250 51.229875 isn't that awful [laughter] how about you what do you have there
sw3077B-ms98-a-0010 51.229875 52.382500 [silence]
sw3077B-ms98-a-0011 52.382500 55.233750 uh-huh and you have state income tax also
sw3077B-ms98-a-0012 55.233750 62.274625 um-hum yeah well it's been people here have just have this um they've been really holding out in the legislature and
sw3077B-ms98-a-0013 62.274625 77.213750 it's starting to show um in a lot of ways as far as things that are just totally under funded and and i don't know if Texas is ever going to be able to to um totally avoid having an income tax or not i think eventually they're going to have to do it
sw3077B-ms98-a-0014 77.213750 81.899625 but um do you think you pay too much there or how do you feel about that
sw3077B-ms98-a-0015 81.899625 85.706125 [silence]
sw3077B-ms98-a-0016 85.706125 89.038000 oh really interesting uh-huh
sw3077B-ms98-a-0017 89.038000 93.751375 [silence]
sw3077B-ms98-a-0018 93.751375 95.519750 yeah yes
sw3077B-ms98-a-0019 95.519750 101.275875 [silence]
sw3077B-ms98-a-0020 101.275875 104.849000 uh-huh um yes we do have tax on clothes
sw3077B-ms98-a-0021 104.849000 107.820000 [silence]
sw3077B-ms98-a-0022 107.820000 109.177375 uh-huh
sw3077B-ms98-a-0023 109.177375 118.039125 [silence]
sw3077B-ms98-a-0024 118.039125 126.267375 how interesting i guess i didn't realize that um we don't have tax on groceries for instance um
sw3077B-ms98-a-0025 126.267375 130.068375 [silence]
sw3077B-ms98-a-0026 130.068375 131.197750 yeah
sw3077B-ms98-a-0027 131.197750 132.581375 [silence]
sw3077B-ms98-a-0028 132.581375 141.224625 right yes yes i should i should've um delineated yet your absolutely right it's the food the consumable food parts that you know we don't have to pay tax on yeah
sw3077B-ms98-a-0029 141.224625 155.984875 yeah and you really have to watch your your um your bill sometimes i think um it's real interesting to look to see how many things that i buy in a grocery store which are not really edible groceries [laughter] and that's when it really starts to add on and um
sw3077B-ms98-a-0030 155.984875 167.042125 so um that's that is sort of a help but um i don't know it's just eight and a quarter just seems like an awfully lot of of tax on uh any sale as far as i'm concerned um
sw3077B-ms98-a-0031 167.042125 176.310500 it's real interesting this last um tax season i'm a student and the last tax season i had a just a part time job helping out in a tax office
sw3077B-ms98-a-0032 176.310500 190.847875 and the woman that owned the office was saying she'd had this business for oh probably seventeen or eighteen years and she was saying as the years have gone on there are fewer and fewer things that people can uh take off of their income tax
sw3077B-ms98-a-0033 190.847875 200.256000 and uh you know if you're not a home owner it's or if you haven't sold property or uh have something major like that it's hardly you know it it's just not much else you can do
sw3077B-ms98-a-0034 200.256000 211.535875 and she said it's really taken the fun out of doing taxes for people for her because she used to be real creative about helping them find ways of you know accumulating receipts can't do oh really
sw3077B-ms98-a-0035 211.535875 214.704500 can't do it any more [laughter] so
sw3077B-ms98-a-0036 214.704500 218.122250 [silence]
sw3077B-ms98-a-0037 218.122250 219.337750 uh-huh
sw3077B-ms98-a-0038 219.337750 225.415250 [silence]
sw3077B-ms98-a-0039 225.415250 230.035375 [laughter] how interesting
sw3077B-ms98-a-0040 230.035375 232.715000 oh gosh where did you go to school
sw3077B-ms98-a-0041 232.715000 241.499500 uh-huh uh-huh well you're you're the same age as my daughter because she just graduated from college this year too i'm a graduate student having gone back after many years so um
sw3077B-ms98-a-0042 241.499500 244.700750 nevertheless i am a student and poor [laughter]
sw3077B-ms98-a-0043 244.700750 247.083000 so it's uh um
sw3077B-ms98-a-0044 247.083000 260.450500 you know it's been i- i guess as far as people like uh our family we can feel like sometimes we pay more than our share as middle class people with Americans with um college age students you know and
sw3077B-ms98-a-0045 260.450500 267.374375 and i there just i don't know i guess as you say you just have to look around and decide that most of the other people that you know are paying about what you are and
sw3077B-ms98-a-0046 267.374375 281.939375 [silence]
sw3077B-ms98-a-0047 281.939375 288.810875 oh yes absolutely yeah because_1 uh it seems like y[ou]- they still come out okay um you know uh they
sw3077B-ms98-a-0048 288.810875 292.977500 [silence]
sw3077B-ms98-a-0049 292.977500 293.834250 yeah
sw3077B-ms98-a-0050 293.834250 295.161875 [silence]
sw3077B-ms98-a-0051 295.161875 299.376750 i kind of have my doubts [laughter]
sw3077B-ms98-a-0052 299.376750 300.282125 uh-huh
sw3077B-ms98-a-0053 300.282125 302.199875 [silence]
sw3077B-ms98-a-0054 302.199875 303.107875 that's
sw3077B-ms98-a-0055 303.107875 308.571875 [silence]
sw3077B-ms98-a-0056 308.571875 323.424500 yes seems that way yeah that the higher they get the you know at least i don't know it seems like um they must feel like they're paid for all of the years of experience or um [vocalized-noise] or or something or just the title sometimes um 
sw3077B-ms98-a-0057 323.424500 332.395000 and it it doesn't seem fair and i- i know a lot of people do make money um you know in in good investments and things like that
sw3077B-ms98-a-0058 332.395000 338.609250 but i think that's a lot of luck and a lot of gambling and not a wh[ole]- not a whole lot of work [laughter]
sw3077B-ms98-a-0059 338.609250 341.221250 [silence]
sw3077B-ms98-a-0060 341.221250 342.650375 yes
sw3077B-ms98-a-0061 342.650375 343.941375 right
sw3077B-ms98-a-0062 343.941375 351.414875 [silence]
sw3077B-ms98-a-0063 351.414875 352.431500 uh-huh
sw3077B-ms98-a-0064 352.431500 358.014500 [silence]
sw3077B-ms98-a-0065 358.014500 358.802500 right
sw3077B-ms98-a-0066 358.802500 359.899500 [silence]
sw3077B-ms98-a-0067 359.899500 361.313625 probably not
sw3077B-ms98-a-0068 361.313625 363.121250 [silence]
sw3077B-ms98-a-0069 363.121250 370.343500 yeah yes or what's left is not going to be worth anything um you know in terms of how you can actually use it
sw3077B-ms98-a-0070 370.343500 371.716875 [silence]
sw3077B-ms98-a-0071 371.716875 374.363250 yeah right but that's well and
sw3077B-ms98-a-0072 374.363250 375.557875 [silence]
sw3077B-ms98-a-0073 375.557875 387.686125 that's right yeah yeah that's i haven't heard much um in recent years um about social security i mean for a while there not too long ago they were they were saying that the the whole system was going to be um bankrupt
sw3077B-ms98-a-0074 387.686125 396.945375 you know before very long because so much was going out for programs that were it wa[s]- that originally it was never intended to be used for or you know programs just weren't in existence and um
sw3077B-ms98-a-0075 396.945375 404.551875 then i it sort of calmed down i haven't heard much lately but if you have talked about that in your classes you know in the last few years i'm sure that you have heard
sw3077B-ms98-a-0076 404.551875 411.323625 yeah well um i don't know i guess we complain about taxes but i guess you know uh you have to be sort of
sw3077B-ms98-a-0077 411.323625 412.744125 [silence]
sw3077B-ms98-a-0078 412.744125 418.630000 yeah you have to appreciate yeah what what you do get for them sometimes and um
sw3077B-ms98-a-0079 418.630000 433.050375 i guess it's it's worse you know i'd rather s[ee]- be able s[ee]- to control my money as much as i do with what's left over after taxes than to live in oh England or um some some countries where so much of it is socialized that you don't see any of that money at all
sw3077B-ms98-a-0080 433.050375 437.811750 and so you know i guess it's all relative [laughter]
sw3077B-ms98-a-0081 437.811750 439.835375 yeah that's exactly right
sw3077B-ms98-a-0082 439.835375 446.226750 [silence]
sw3077B-ms98-a-0083 446.226750 448.123875 that's right yeah and i
