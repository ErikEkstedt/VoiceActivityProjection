sw3098B-ms98-a-0051 284.517375 288.778750 whether or not there was something that inside you really wanted to do

sw3098B-ms98-a-0053 295.450875 309.074125 and then yes or no whether i have children it's not so much a [vocalized-noise] society dictating to you do this you know it's everybody is supposed to get married and have kids if you do not want kids fine do not have them

sw3098B-ms98-a-0062 351.495125 360.511625 i could have children and and cope with it i have too many bad feelings with my own childhood and maybe i will turn out to be you know abusive like my mother was
sw3098B-ms98-a-0063 360.511625 370.309250 so they say you know i i do not feel that i want to do that which is fine you know i i think that's a wonderful decision on their part if that's how they truly feel

sw3098B-ms98-a-0070 406.618125 419.984875 so you know it did not make the best situation for her you know to have uh you know good family kind of situation there she had brothers and sisters that kind of like pushed her [laughter] around a lot because they were so much older
