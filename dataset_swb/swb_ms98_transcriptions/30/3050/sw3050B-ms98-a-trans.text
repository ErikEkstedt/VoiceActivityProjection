sw3050B-ms98-a-0052 238.029875 246.861375 and it actually um they say the the i haven't played the course but they say the course is very is is is pretty tough pretty challenging
sw3050B-ms98-a-0053 246.861375 251.498750 and it's um not only that but it's exceedingly well kept apparently because
sw3050B-ms98-a-0054 251.498750 264.996625 th[ose]- those are the comments i kept hearing from the pros you know they kept saying you know we we hear [vocalized-noise] you know on on television so granted that it is biased but they keep saying it's just wonderful uh the course is so well maintained and you know it it it rained through half the um 
sw3050B-ms98-a-0055 264.996625 273.680125 tournament so people had to finish it down and stuff but they still the grounds keepers were absolutely wonderful about getting things back up again and this actually when when the um
sw3050B-ms98-a-0056 273.680125 285.244875 when the LPGA came here i guess that was about a week and a half ago it was just it it takes over the whole town you know it's all over the news and lots and lots of people take off work

sw3050B-ms98-a-0095 440.998000 449.694875 and we both just sort of get these random checks in the mail and to be honest i- i really have not been accounting i just sort of figured well it's going to work you know if it works it works so
