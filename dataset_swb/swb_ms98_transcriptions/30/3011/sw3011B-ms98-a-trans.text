sw3011B-ms98-a-0050 334.481125 343.735125 yeah well uh Texas is a big state so i imagine the the type of houses and uh things like that are truly different from area to area [laughter] but uh
sw3011B-ms98-a-0051 343.735125 352.496375 [noise] that's the same way out here because_1 um well we for example and we live fifteen miles from the beltway that surrounds Washington
sw3011B-ms98-a-0052 352.496375 359.769000 and anything inside that beltway the highway the real estate's forty thousand dollars more expensive
sw3011B-ms98-a-0053 359.769000 374.689625 so you know you really can't afford i- i- i could never afford a house inside the beltway that's why we came out here this is called the the the country you know with only you know maybe twenty miles total from DC twenty five
sw3011B-ms98-a-0054 374.689625 381.977000 from the city but um it's considered the country since it's uh you know that far out
sw3011B-ms98-a-0055 381.977000 386.279875 but um yeah we live out by Dulles Airport

sw3011B-ms98-a-0057 398.479875 407.489250 uh not too much of northern Virginia is like that anymore land has gotten so expensive they just can't afford to have low income housing like that
sw3011B-ms98-a-0058 407.489250 410.349000 [silence]
sw3011B-ms98-a-0059 410.349000 417.272875 no we're in a development there's uh yeah there's another one half an acre away or a quarter acre away rather
