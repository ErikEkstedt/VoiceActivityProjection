sw3023A-ms98-a-0002 0.065250 1.822125 i've uh
sw3023A-ms98-a-0003 1.822125 2.869875 i've
sw3023A-ms98-a-0004 2.869875 12.027875 well i've had i used to have the opinion that there wa[s]- that there really wasn't any more crime in America in the cities anyway than there was in previous centuries
sw3023A-ms98-a-0005 12.027875 17.874500 uh before uh simply because the reason there seems to be so much was the fact that
sw3023A-ms98-a-0006 17.874500 24.906250 the police now had advanced uh reporting methods with computers and other devices
sw3023A-ms98-a-0007 24.906250 30.491375 that's right and those statistics [noise] in turn got them bigger budgets
sw3023A-ms98-a-0008 30.491375 39.543375 however i have been persuaded lately i guess simply by the uh overwhelming data that seems to be available that there is indeed a lot more violent crime
sw3023A-ms98-a-0009 39.543375 40.725125 [silence]
sw3023A-ms98-a-0010 40.725125 42.389625 well yeah
sw3023A-ms98-a-0011 42.389625 45.207875 no i am in i am in Washington D C
sw3023A-ms98-a-0012 45.207875 57.020375 actually it you know i do a lot of business here and i come here quite often and and that again is a is a sort of media perception there's some absolutely lovely and marvelous and peaceful areas in Washington
sw3023A-ms98-a-0013 57.020375 65.753625 regardless of the racial makeup but it's it's these real uh there's pockets of violence that is so violent that they uh
sw3023A-ms98-a-0014 65.753625 67.518250 yeah
sw3023A-ms98-a-0015 67.518250 72.021750 right now just to focus on that a minute i guess uh
sw3023A-ms98-a-0016 72.021750 77.708500 um when um previous secretary of uh
sw3023A-ms98-a-0017 77.708500 85.965250 educate Bennett i think his name was became the drug czar uh for uh uh President Bush he was going to focus on it
sw3023A-ms98-a-0018 85.965250 94.857875 [vocalized-noise] on this area and do something about it and i see that even he was met without with with little success even though the entire
sw3023A-ms98-a-0019 94.857875 100.761125 i guess a a quite a bit of money and and other uh planning efforts went into that
sw3023A-ms98-a-0020 100.761125 102.356375 [silence]
sw3023A-ms98-a-0021 102.356375 103.585875 well
sw3023A-ms98-a-0022 103.585875 109.850375 [silence]
sw3023A-ms98-a-0023 109.850375 110.864000 yes
sw3023A-ms98-a-0024 110.864000 124.661875 well i uh i have three theories about it you know three things i have one theory and it's [vocalized-noise] by two things one i i believe that this is a function of uh the violence that young people see on television and in the movies 
sw3023A-ms98-a-0025 124.661875 128.038000 and i am not just talking about you know uh
sw3023A-ms98-a-0026 128.038000 133.889750 role models of uh of tough guys and gangsters and things like that i'm i'm not even
sw3023A-ms98-a-0027 133.889750 135.262000 i'm not even
sw3023A-ms98-a-0028 135.262000 150.152375 convinced that maybe things like uh football hockey and the the and and you know the the and even baseball games now where the everything is settled with a fight you know the the immediate need to show some sort of violence to settle the uh the argument and
sw3023A-ms98-a-0029 150.152375 160.489000 and then i i am an advocate of hand gun control to some degree so i think that particularly i i was reading the other day about uh Corpus Christi Texas which has the [vocalized-noise] highest
sw3023A-ms98-a-0030 160.489000 166.247875 i think it's Corp[us]- [vocalized-noise] Corpus Christi that had the highest rates per hand gun death in America
sw3023A-ms98-a-0031 166.247875 174.244000 uh per capita i mean the Saturday night special stuff so that that's what i think about it that's some of the things i think about it plus uh
sw3023A-ms98-a-0032 174.244000 174.982000 [noise]
sw3023A-ms98-a-0033 174.982000 176.900750 i know what are your views
sw3023A-ms98-a-0034 176.900750 185.279250 [silence]
sw3023A-ms98-a-0035 185.279250 186.289625 yes
sw3023A-ms98-a-0036 186.289625 195.311750 [silence]
sw3023A-ms98-a-0037 195.311750 199.052375 exac[tly]- well that's that's that's the impression i get yeah
sw3023A-ms98-a-0038 199.052375 210.607000 and i and i imagine it's it you know it just feeds upon itself when when we have this sort of violence in society people want to it conditions people to it and
sw3023A-ms98-a-0039 210.607000 224.802375 uh you have to emph[asize]- it has to be even uh magnified to attract people's attention i guess to have them spend money on something like that and i am sure that it does form role models for young for young men and young women and
sw3023A-ms98-a-0040 224.802375 229.349125 uh i mean i i read now where where
sw3023A-ms98-a-0041 229.349125 234.056625 you know women are arr[ested]- young women are arrested fighting with knives over over
sw3023A-ms98-a-0042 234.056625 245.533500 whatever [vocalized-noise] whatever reason which is kind of unheard of when i was young now i do not want to sound like an old fart but [laughter] but that that's what it seems that those things happened before
sw3023A-ms98-a-0043 245.533500 253.265250 it didn't happen in that manner before television and i i i i have to think that that it has some influence on it
sw3023A-ms98-a-0044 253.265250 253.788875 but
sw3023A-ms98-a-0045 253.788875 255.737750 [silence]
sw3023A-ms98-a-0046 255.737750 256.782750 yeah
sw3023A-ms98-a-0047 256.782750 258.337000 [silence]
sw3023A-ms98-a-0048 258.337000 259.471000 no
sw3023A-ms98-a-0049 259.471000 269.395000 [silence]
sw3023A-ms98-a-0050 269.395000 270.866000 oh yes
sw3023A-ms98-a-0051 270.866000 285.804500 [silence]
sw3023A-ms98-a-0052 285.804500 286.946125 yeah
sw3023A-ms98-a-0053 286.946125 288.006625 yeah
sw3023A-ms98-a-0054 288.006625 302.379250 [silence]
sw3023A-ms98-a-0055 302.379250 310.374625 yes yes well i mean i i guess so what i wanted to say and i stopped uh i do not know i got diverted was uh that
sw3023A-ms98-a-0056 310.374625 311.711625 [silence]
sw3023A-ms98-a-0057 311.711625 320.992750 uh there's so mu[ch]- there's so much of a return from pris[on]- to prison that the rehabilitation programs seem to be a failure and
sw3023A-ms98-a-0058 320.992750 335.289875 and that is not emphasized i recognize there's there's over crowding problems and and since we have decided to put everybody in jail that commits a crime now that that's complicated the entire process what i also think is that
sw3023A-ms98-a-0059 335.289875 344.128625 i i guess it's the reflection of of the society where where we have so much more mobility and less
sw3023A-ms98-a-0060 344.128625 346.198375 attachment to
sw3023A-ms98-a-0061 346.198375 350.078250 uh you know it does not seem to be any responsibility to the community
sw3023A-ms98-a-0062 350.078250 355.772750 where you where you live or i do not mean respons[ibility]- attachment and responsibility i guess i mean
sw3023A-ms98-a-0063 355.772750 357.578125 any sort of
sw3023A-ms98-a-0064 357.578125 360.680375 [silence]
sw3023A-ms98-a-0065 360.680375 362.840750 yes that's right th[at]- yeah
sw3023A-ms98-a-0066 362.840750 372.629500 i i do not know how that's i do not think it's done by uh the changes come simply by statutory nature i do not know what it really will take [laughter]
sw3023A-ms98-a-0067 372.629500 379.845375 huh and i do not know if i have solutions except except to you know i am sort of a a an advocate of
sw3023A-ms98-a-0068 379.845375 386.469875 of uh of letting people of having free speech and i guess to curb
sw3023A-ms98-a-0069 386.469875 399.035875 uh television uh the violence on television and in the movies would be contrary to my beliefs in that however there does seem to be a right now in verbalizing it does seem to be a higher need for something of that sort
sw3023A-ms98-a-0070 399.035875 402.076000 and the sacrifice isn't that great
sw3023A-ms98-a-0071 402.076000 405.153250 [silence]
sw3023A-ms98-a-0072 405.153250 406.334250 yeah
sw3023A-ms98-a-0073 406.334250 409.392750 [silence]
sw3023A-ms98-a-0074 409.392750 412.242000 yes yes i think i think that's correct
sw3023A-ms98-a-0075 412.242000 415.118375 [silence]
sw3023A-ms98-a-0076 415.118375 422.388625 well Texas has uh Texas has uh has always struck me i mean i i i have lived in and out of Texas both in the service and
sw3023A-ms98-a-0077 422.388625 432.459000 and uh uh short business stints and it seems to me they are a pretty pretty tough law and order state but [vocalized-noise] but yet that does not seem to have effected the
sw3023A-ms98-a-0078 432.459000 435.898375 amount of violent right in the state just citing that you know
sw3023A-ms98-a-0079 435.898375 445.649750 [silence]
sw3023A-ms98-a-0080 445.649750 446.905250 yeah
sw3023A-ms98-a-0081 446.905250 448.124000 [silence]
sw3023A-ms98-a-0082 448.124000 449.793375 yeah
