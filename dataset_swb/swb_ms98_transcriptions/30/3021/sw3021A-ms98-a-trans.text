sw3021A-ms98-a-0002 0.071375 9.028625 well i grew up out in the country and uh was used to having uh guns around the place and uh i'm
sw3021A-ms98-a-0003 9.028625 16.577250 i'm not for gun control in the strictest sense of the uh word
sw3021A-ms98-a-0004 16.577250 20.102375 [silence]
sw3021A-ms98-a-0005 20.102375 21.308125 yeah

sw3021A-ms98-a-0007 30.838375 32.130375 yeah
sw3021A-ms98-a-0008 32.130375 38.333625 [silence]
sw3021A-ms98-a-0009 38.333625 52.962375 yeah well i- i feel that its uh i think the what was it the National Rifle Association uh had this bumper sticker a few years back if uh about if you outlaw guns only outlaws will have guns then
sw3021A-ms98-a-0010 52.962375 64.547500 and i believe that too because the person that's wanting to commit a crime is going to find a way to get a gun gun gun a knife a a rock a stick whatever it is to commit a crime with
sw3021A-ms98-a-0011 64.547500 74.606625 and it's the honest citizens like ourselves that are responsible about use of guns uh we can handle it but there's a element that can't
sw3021A-ms98-a-0012 74.606625 84.295250 [silence]
sw3021A-ms98-a-0013 84.295250 86.414000 you have got them outgunned
sw3021A-ms98-a-0014 86.414000 91.306000 there was a an article in the paper just this week where i think it's uh
sw3021A-ms98-a-0015 91.306000 97.675500 one of the gun companies i can't remember which was developing a ten milli[meter]- ten millimeter
sw3021A-ms98-a-0016 97.675500 111.649375 automatic pistol for the FBI which would give them additional firepower it had held like a fifteen shot clip which uh would be able th[ey]- they would be able to put down anything that came at them_1
sw3021A-ms98-a-0017 111.649375 122.610750 but if you figure you got some drug guy out there that's got an Uzi machine gun uh a a a thirty eight uh Smith and Wesson revolver isn't going to do you much good
sw3021A-ms98-a-0018 122.610750 137.476125 yeah i have lived in uh Illinois at one time and they they passed a uh it wasn't really gun control but it was you had to register as a gun owner you didn't have to list your guns
sw3021A-ms98-a-0019 137.476125 145.486875 but you had to have this card it was like a driver's license card that you had to have it in order to buy ammunition
sw3021A-ms98-a-0020 145.486875 155.145375 and that's the first uh this was twenty years ago but they had that so that uh they were trying to control it a little bit uh in that respect
sw3021A-ms98-a-0021 155.145375 156.214500 pardon
sw3021A-ms98-a-0022 156.214500 158.550625 [silence]
sw3021A-ms98-a-0023 158.550625 160.234875 yeah uh-huh
sw3021A-ms98-a-0024 160.234875 166.506750 [silence]
sw3021A-ms98-a-0025 166.506750 167.634500 yeah
sw3021A-ms98-a-0026 167.634500 169.224000 [silence]
sw3021A-ms98-a-0027 169.224000 170.642750 yeah
sw3021A-ms98-a-0028 170.642750 172.023750 yeah
sw3021A-ms98-a-0029 172.023750 175.201250 [silence]

sw3021A-ms98-a-0031 176.402250 177.540000 [silence]
sw3021A-ms98-a-0032 177.540000 178.753750 yeah
sw3021A-ms98-a-0033 178.753750 189.140375 we lived in Tennessee for awhile and i bought a pistol there and there was a fifteen day waiting period you had to fill out an application and go down to the sheriff's office and get fingerprinted
sw3021A-ms98-a-0034 189.140375 198.050375 and then you had fifteen days while they checked to see if you had any kind of criminal record before that you could pick up the gun you were purchasing
sw3021A-ms98-a-0035 198.050375 209.244000 and no i think that uh you know a a waiting period uh can make a difference but again it's going to be the law abiding citizen that's going to comply with that
sw3021A-ms98-a-0036 209.244000 215.489625 so there's i don't think there's any way to control the criminal element as far as guns is concerned because_1
sw3021A-ms98-a-0037 215.489625 219.259250 [silence]
sw3021A-ms98-a-0038 219.259250 220.895000 right right

sw3021A-ms98-a-0040 228.497750 235.795500 yeah i'm [laughter] we we're getting into capital punishment now [laughter] but i- i agree with you there that uh
sw3021A-ms98-a-0041 235.795500 245.575375 yeah the uh the again the purpose of gun control is to control how it's being used is what the purpose should be
sw3021A-ms98-a-0042 245.575375 254.624125 it's not to keep people from buying a gun that need one for a specific purpose legal purpose but to keep the guy that's illegal from getting his hands on one
sw3021A-ms98-a-0043 254.624125 266.577000 and i'm in favor of keeping the the illegal guy from getting one in his hands but the legal person or lawful person should not be penalized because there is the criminal element
sw3021A-ms98-a-0044 266.577000 269.998500 [silence]
sw3021A-ms98-a-0045 269.998500 271.479500 oh yes

sw3021A-ms98-a-0058 320.831500 327.962375 but uh still i think they ought to know how to use one and it is not just a toy and that when
sw3021A-ms98-a-0059 327.962375 336.128375 it's not like on TV when someone gets shot uh they get back up if someone gets shot with a real gun they don't get back up
