sw3012B-ms98-a-0007 18.013500 21.635125 yeah uh no i haven't pushed one yet i just
sw3012B-ms98-a-0008 21.635125 23.534375 [silence]
sw3012B-ms98-a-0009 23.534375 26.342000 oh okay we're just sort of getting acquainted here [laughter]
sw3012B-ms98-a-0010 26.342000 33.588625 um you know i i just wanted to see if you know you had an opinion about this or you know
sw3012B-ms98-a-0011 33.588625 39.325250 um so if that's okay with you then i'll just press one okay
sw3012B-ms98-a-0012 39.325250 40.282625 [noise]
sw3012B-ms98-a-0013 40.282625 44.600750 well hi [laughter] good morning um 
sw3012B-ms98-a-0014 44.600750 53.005875 i think i mean if if i start this i just wanted to say that um
sw3012B-ms98-a-0015 53.005875 65.005375 one of the things that i don't think we really understood about the the middle eastern situation is that they're a totally different type of people than we are and i mean they think differently
sw3012B-ms98-a-0016 65.005375 79.073625 and their idea of what is justice is totally different from ours and and right now i i think that that's been proven in the fact that um they have just
sw3012B-ms98-a-0017 79.073625 93.561500 well anyway i just think that you know the United States policy over there i think we should just leave them_1 alone i really do in in a major way because they just um
sw3012B-ms98-a-0018 93.561500 99.252375 that whole region over there i think needs to settle it's own differences within itself
sw3012B-ms98-a-0019 99.252375 109.925875 and that's the way the course that they should go i mean you know we can maybe help them a little bit prompt them but i don't think this intervention at such high levels
sw3012B-ms98-a-0020 109.925875 120.811875 should be going on the the thing with Israel and Palestine i believe that should be settled between them and also um you know
sw3012B-ms98-a-0021 120.811875 128.353625 the other thing is their idea or our id[ea]- idea of democracy has nothing to do with them
sw3012B-ms98-a-0022 128.353625 142.130000 i mean tha[t]- i mean i'm talking about the whole middle ea[stern]- and and maybe this is too general but i just believe that um they do not look at democracy the same way we do they don't understand it as we don't understand the way they live
sw3012B-ms98-a-0023 142.130000 152.964750 and so you know trying to put like a square peg in a round hole is just you know i[t]- i don't think that that's the way to go in this and um you know it it
sw3012B-ms98-a-0024 152.964750 160.348125 oh well that's that's a couple thoughts on it i i guess you know i'd like you to maybe express [laughter-something] here
sw3012B-ms98-a-0025 160.348125 167.257000 [silence]
sw3012B-ms98-a-0026 167.257000 168.500625 yeah
sw3012B-ms98-a-0027 168.500625 176.463625 [silence]
sw3012B-ms98-a-0028 176.463625 178.723125 that's yeah
sw3012B-ms98-a-0029 178.723125 213.454625 [silence]
sw3012B-ms98-a-0030 213.454625 228.346750 well ye[ah]- well yeah um i i guess we could be a catalyst for their change i um the war has certainly sort of set things on end over there and i don't think we'd be talking about this
sw3012B-ms98-a-0031 228.346750 237.402875 you know the Israeli situation Palestinian situation um sort of came to a head um unless there had been a war i mean that was
sw3012B-ms98-a-0032 237.402875 250.227250 one thing that came out of it good or bad i i don't judge any war as good or bad it's just a war [laughter] and i don't see any winners or losers i just see dead bodies i'm sorry [laughter] you know but um
sw3012B-ms98-a-0033 250.227250 261.019125 i- i i just think you know you're right and i think maybe it's at a whole different level of them trying to cooperate and get along
sw3012B-ms98-a-0034 261.019125 271.608000 it's not going to be that we're going to uh you know sort of tell them to go to their room and that's going to solve the whole problem it's going to be them
sw3012B-ms98-a-0035 271.608000 273.960750 yeah
sw3012B-ms98-a-0036 273.960750 275.747750 [silence]
sw3012B-ms98-a-0037 275.747750 277.721125 and you know
sw3012B-ms98-a-0038 277.721125 281.141500 [silence]
sw3012B-ms98-a-0039 281.141500 282.405750 it's
sw3012B-ms98-a-0040 282.405750 286.220000 yeah that that's true too i um
sw3012B-ms98-a-0041 286.220000 289.484500 [silence]
sw3012B-ms98-a-0042 289.484500 304.231375 oh well yeah they they understand violence [laughter] they love violent leaders to you know i mean look at you know the leader they had they they just adored him because he was so strict and cruel and you know for a while there he had them_1 [vocalized-noise]
sw3012B-ms98-a-0043 304.231375 312.344000 well it has a lot to do with their religion i got to say that over there um and i know this
sw3012B-ms98-a-0044 312.344000 326.525125 only because from personal experience that i'm speaking of this because i've i've you know traveled around town with different cab drivers in a situation where i've done that and o[ne]- one of the kindest people i've ever met in my whole life
sw3012B-ms98-a-0045 326.525125 330.772625 um is from that area of the country and i mean he is just
sw3012B-ms98-a-0046 330.772625 342.151625 overly he he is abounding in kindness let's say and his life is so Godly i mean every thought they have a totally different life than we have
sw3012B-ms98-a-0047 342.151625 353.469750 you know and when you add the um commercialization of the western world it sort of screws everything up for them and they have very basic life um
sw3012B-ms98-a-0048 353.469750 366.881500 well it's just a very basic life and they just really believe in Allah or God or whatever and it's you know everything is to the glory of Allah and and you know and it it's almost like
sw3012B-ms98-a-0049 366.881500 367.980750 [silence]
sw3012B-ms98-a-0050 367.980750 369.987375 yeah well that's see
sw3012B-ms98-a-0051 369.987375 372.855875 th[at]- using that yeah
sw3012B-ms98-a-0052 372.855875 379.281875 and it's always been military and it's always been and that's that's always been the way of the world don't you think [laughter]
sw3012B-ms98-a-0053 379.281875 382.561750 [silence]
sw3012B-ms98-a-0054 382.561750 388.425375 yeah so it's really hard when you see the leaders compared to the people
sw3012B-ms98-a-0055 388.425375 401.689375 [silence]
sw3012B-ms98-a-0056 401.689375 404.848500 yeah yeah
sw3012B-ms98-a-0057 404.848500 417.740500 [silence]
sw3012B-ms98-a-0058 417.740500 421.806500 right and surrendering that was [laughter-yeah]
sw3012B-ms98-a-0059 421.806500 424.000750 [silence]
sw3012B-ms98-a-0060 424.000750 432.136375 it just really comes down to people are people you know you have to have some compassion some humanness doesn't matter where the boundaries are
sw3012B-ms98-a-0061 432.136375 441.261750 um you know there are political boundaries and those are man made boundaries but you know for heaven sakes that's something that's been going on for ages and
sw3012B-ms98-a-0062 441.261750 442.928125 [silence]
sw3012B-ms98-a-0063 442.928125 445.440250 yeah that's true
sw3012B-ms98-a-0064 445.440250 449.762250 [silence]
