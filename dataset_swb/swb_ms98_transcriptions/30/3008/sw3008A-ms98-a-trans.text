sw3008A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.500000 [silence] 
sw3008A-ms98-a-0002 0.500000 2.032625 um
sw3008A-ms98-a-0003 2.032625 9.644375 fringe benefits are very important in the comp[any]- in the company i think to provide the employee with a sense of security
sw3008A-ms98-a-0004 9.644375 11.864250 do you agree with that or [laughter]
sw3008A-ms98-a-0005 11.864250 18.638875 [silence]
sw3008A-ms98-a-0006 18.638875 31.492875 yes at the rising cost of health uh care now it's uh if you have to go out and buy your company coverage you probably have to spend three four hundred dollars a month to get anything that even came close to it
sw3008A-ms98-a-0007 31.492875 36.836250 [silence]
sw3008A-ms98-a-0008 36.836250 38.005500 yeah
sw3008A-ms98-a-0009 38.005500 44.426500 we uh we've just got dental insurance after the first of the year it's been i think probably
sw3008A-ms98-a-0010 44.426500 50.225625 oh about eight or nine years since we had dental coverage and it sure makes a difference and 
sw3008A-ms98-a-0011 50.225625 58.731000 [silence]
sw3008A-ms98-a-0012 58.731000 59.815000 yeah
sw3008A-ms98-a-0013 59.815000 72.943875 i think the in the insurance area one of the things that we also got that we didn't have befo[re]- what we haven't had in about eight years is the card for prescriptions where you go in and just pay a minimal amount for prescriptions
sw3008A-ms98-a-0014 72.943875 79.328500 and uh we have some that are fairly expensive sixty seventy dollars well now we pay eight dollars for them
sw3008A-ms98-a-0015 79.328500 82.850250 [silence]
sw3008A-ms98-a-0016 82.850250 86.150625 uh no that's just all prescriptions uh
sw3008A-ms98-a-0017 86.150625 90.026250 [silence]
sw3008A-ms98-a-0018 90.026250 101.581125 yeah and it's a i think it's five dollars on generic drugs and eight dollars on a name brand drug so no matter what they are in fact you have to pay the certain basic cost
sw3008A-ms98-a-0019 101.581125 104.313250 for them you don't have to meet any deductible or anything
sw3008A-ms98-a-0020 104.313250 105.458125 [silence]
sw3008A-ms98-a-0021 105.458125 106.121000 but uh
sw3008A-ms98-a-0022 106.121000 107.513000 [silence]
sw3008A-ms98-a-0023 107.513000 114.030875 uh yeah that's uh just vacation and some sick leave not very much though [laughter]
sw3008A-ms98-a-0024 114.030875 121.019750 [silence]
sw3008A-ms98-a-0025 121.019750 122.844625 [noise] well
sw3008A-ms98-a-0026 122.844625 135.809375 uh really depending uh on what you need kind of it's a case that there if you need more than a couple weeks or eight days or whatever it may be then they they will consider it
sw3008A-ms98-a-0027 135.809375 150.767500 so that's been with the companies i've been with generally at a a executive position they're a little more liberal even though they're not supposed to be supposed to treat everyone the same still leave hard you know rule more liberal with time off due to the all the extra hours executives put in
sw3008A-ms98-a-0028 150.767500 152.280875 [silence]
sw3008A-ms98-a-0029 152.280875 155.239125 but uh the uh
sw3008A-ms98-a-0030 155.239125 162.166250 i think pension costs are making it more and more difficult for them to provide [per/pension] pension benefits too
sw3008A-ms98-a-0031 162.166250 163.757000 it's uh
sw3008A-ms98-a-0032 163.757000 167.779875 yes because_1 it just keeps going an up up and up there too
sw3008A-ms98-a-0033 167.779875 169.955000 but uh there's
sw3008A-ms98-a-0034 169.955000 172.115000 [silence]
sw3008A-ms98-a-0035 172.115000 176.302000 yeah the older you get the more you start thinking about the poss[ibilty]- [noise] pension
sw3008A-ms98-a-0036 176.302000 177.500000 [silence]
sw3008A-ms98-a-0037 177.500000 178.769000 right righ[t]-

sw3008A-ms98-a-0043 202.160750 214.379500 all of a sudden at the end of last year he had a sizeable amount saved up in his Four O One K plan just with the matching funds that the company is putting in and any earnings on investments
sw3008A-ms98-a-0044 214.379500 216.097500 so
sw3008A-ms98-a-0045 216.097500 222.028750 no no he can't but he's only uh twenty seven years old and he's already got a good start
sw3008A-ms98-a-0046 222.028750 226.534375 even if he changes companies he can you know roll that over into another plan
sw3008A-ms98-a-0047 226.534375 235.807375 [silence]

sw3008A-ms98-a-0053 242.182000 248.003875 [laughter] but there's oh there's various intangibles also like uh you know
sw3008A-ms98-a-0054 248.003875 262.244000 taking pride in the company you work for being able to say i work for such and such company or i hold such and such position with this company and that's one of the intangible fringe benefits i guess a certain ego level there
sw3008A-ms98-a-0055 262.244000 263.986500 [silence]
