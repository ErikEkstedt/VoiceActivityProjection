sw3004A-ms98-a-0014 37.960000 59.104500 [silence]

sw3004A-ms98-a-0018 66.984375 68.820625 [silence]
sw3004A-ms98-a-0019 68.820625 78.634000 yeah but yet most of the problems we hear of course maybe that's what we hear about is from organized approved day care centers
sw3004A-ms98-a-0020 78.634000 86.658500 but maybe we don't hear about the other ones though that could be you know the individual incidence or something
sw3004A-ms98-a-0021 86.658500 95.622500 [silence]
sw3004A-ms98-a-0022 95.622500 97.926125 uh-huh how old is your oldest

sw3004A-ms98-a-0030 118.343500 120.547500 [silence]
sw3004A-ms98-a-0031 120.547500 129.722750 that's the way with me i i worked four years one time bu[t]- but my last two children were uh both entering high school age
sw3004A-ms98-a-0032 129.722750 133.934250 and uh they were of course gone while i was w[orking]- working so
sw3004A-ms98-a-0033 133.934250 138.145750 it wasn't a problem i saw and i stayed home [laughter-the] [laughter-rest] of the time
sw3004A-ms98-a-0034 138.145750 141.085625 i so i didn't have that problem either
sw3004A-ms98-a-0035 141.085625 146.555750 now i have my my oldest daughter she has two children and they've been in day care
sw3004A-ms98-a-0036 146.555750 149.527750 uh she works full time
sw3004A-ms98-a-0037 149.527750 150.781500 [silence]
sw3004A-ms98-a-0038 150.781500 156.905375 it it's difficult but yet she's the type of person that i don't know if she'd be happy staying at home
sw3004A-ms98-a-0039 156.905375 165.572500 uh-huh she uh she surprised me though she's done a lot of things that i never thought she would do you [laughter-know] [laughter-with] with the family because she [vocalized-noise]
sw3004A-ms98-a-0040 165.572500 176.966000 the one that said she was never getting married and never going to have any children [laughter] [laughter-so] she uh she spends a lot of quality time i think when she is with with the children
sw3004A-ms98-a-0041 176.966000 184.657625 and uh sh[e]- they've used the day care most of the time they tried on[ce]- once they had a lady come in
sw3004A-ms98-a-0042 184.657625 191.976125 and uh she she also had a small child she brought with her and it did not work out uh
sw3004A-ms98-a-0043 191.976125 201.209625 at all [laughter] it she thought it was going to she was real excited because_1 it was so much easier than taking the children out in the morning but uh
sw3004A-ms98-a-0044 201.209625 213.155625 uh the the lady called and her baby wasn't very old at the time and said she was having trouble and this baby is the is the most pleasant uh real pleasant baby easy to satisfy usually and
sw3004A-ms98-a-0045 213.155625 219.228750 and she was having problems with her and so she called and said things were okay settled down and was all right
sw3004A-ms98-a-0046 219.228750 223.813125 well my daughter decided to come and check and things weren't okay [laughter]
sw3004A-ms98-a-0047 223.813125 228.948250 [laughter-her] her [laughter-one] son was watching the {soapies} which she doesn't allow them_1 to watch the {soapies}
sw3004A-ms98-a-0048 228.948250 233.911375 and the baby was in his crib with the door shut just screaming his heart out
sw3004A-ms98-a-0049 233.911375 237.279125 and the babysitter was in the kitchen with her baby
sw3004A-ms98-a-0050 237.279125 242.576375 and so that ended that [laughter] episode uh she was most upset o[ver]- over
sw3004A-ms98-a-0051 242.576375 244.545000 finding this
sw3004A-ms98-a-0052 244.545000 251.486125 so uh she they kind of had decided that the day care was better there is uh
sw3004A-ms98-a-0053 251.486125 259.828875 more people involved more than one adult they and the age groups are separated and uh
sw3004A-ms98-a-0054 259.828875 268.288250 [silence]
sw3004A-ms98-a-0055 268.288250 269.988500 um-hum hum
sw3004A-ms98-a-0056 269.988500 272.811750 yeah story time
sw3004A-ms98-a-0057 272.811750 277.191750 uh and the this one has been particularly nice it uh
sw3004A-ms98-a-0058 277.191750 285.990750 [noise] it kept track of what they did and they would tell the parents what they did that day you know if they said anything or did anything so it kind of i[t]-
sw3004A-ms98-a-0059 285.990750 287.499875 kept it
sw3004A-ms98-a-0060 287.499875 289.098125 yeah
sw3004A-ms98-a-0061 289.098125 290.364000 [silence]
sw3004A-ms98-a-0062 290.364000 296.031875 i oft[en]- i always thought that if you were checking into a day care that you would be good to get references
sw3004A-ms98-a-0063 296.031875 302.397875 uh on people that had been in that day care but was no longer there
sw3004A-ms98-a-0064 302.397875 312.021625 because they wouldn't have nothing to worry about saying you know if there was a problem they they would i think be more ready to tell you what it was
sw3004A-ms98-a-0065 312.021625 315.193875 [silence]
sw3004A-ms98-a-0066 315.193875 317.376375 they might not say any[thing]-
sw3004A-ms98-a-0067 317.376375 318.813500 and uh
sw3004A-ms98-a-0068 318.813500 327.434125 other than how else how do you judge other than from what others have uh what you see uh the cleanliness and that type of thing
sw3004A-ms98-a-0069 327.434125 328.363750 uh
sw3004A-ms98-a-0070 328.363750 332.138875 [silence]

sw3004A-ms98-a-0073 336.048875 341.456375 but it would be real difficult to pick y[ou]- you know to find one and decide
sw3004A-ms98-a-0074 341.456375 346.519250 [silence]
sw3004A-ms98-a-0075 346.519250 347.565875 um

sw3004A-ms98-a-0101 444.120875 447.142125 because they're stuck with their grandchildren so much
