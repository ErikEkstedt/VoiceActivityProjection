sw3018A-ms98-a-0053 202.027625 204.934500 they renovate an old house and
sw3018A-ms98-a-0054 204.934500 206.055375 [silence]

sw3018A-ms98-a-0058 215.375500 217.211875 [silence]
sw3018A-ms98-a-0059 217.211875 226.477875 yeah if it's someb[ody]- if it's a team or something that i am really interested in i- i am not one to just watch
sw3018A-ms98-a-0060 226.477875 238.287375 a football game just to be just to be watching it or i am not a big basketball or baseball fan if it unless it's baseball if it's some if it's a team i really like i may watch but uh
sw3018A-ms98-a-0061 238.287375 248.264250 its uh baseball to me is a little hard to watch on TV for an extended period yeah its so slow that you just get bored i'll i'll switch between
sw3018A-ms98-a-0062 248.264250 257.960250 something else and and and a baseball game going back and forth you know watching it but i usually if if if it's a football team i really like a college team or or
sw3018A-ms98-a-0063 257.960250 265.271875 pro team that i'm fond of i usually will will sit and watch that but uh that's the

sw3018A-ms98-a-0071 285.581750 289.034500 um what more people are doing and i think that's
sw3018A-ms98-a-0072 289.034500 296.739625 [vocalized-noise] you know as as TV i think that less good shows being on TV has caused a lot of people to do
sw3018A-ms98-a-0073 296.739625 298.597000 to do that uh
sw3018A-ms98-a-0074 298.597000 308.587250 you know to get more movies and watch i know we've we've done that too in the past uh we don't do it quite as much now because_1 huh our baby won't let us watch them_1 but uh
sw3018A-ms98-a-0075 308.587250 315.003500 uh you know we usually will we used to rent uh two or three movies on a weekend and and and try to watch

sw3018A-ms98-a-0083 360.982500 368.775250 they look and they when they when we reach a certain number of people in that area they'll put one in put some in or they'll at least consider it so
