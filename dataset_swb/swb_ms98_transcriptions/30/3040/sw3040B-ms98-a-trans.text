sw3040B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.072875 [noise]
sw3040B-ms98-a-0002 1.072875 4.058375 well we uh taxes
sw3040B-ms98-a-0003 4.058375 14.057750 everyone thinks taxes are too high i'm sure but uh i think we do get quite a v[alue]- good value for the tax dollars we spend in most cases
sw3040B-ms98-a-0004 14.057750 15.620625 what do you think
sw3040B-ms98-a-0005 15.620625 46.698500 [silence]
sw3040B-ms98-a-0006 46.698500 49.815250 [laughter] at this stage it's hard to tell [laughter]
sw3040B-ms98-a-0007 49.815250 51.801500 [silence]
sw3040B-ms98-a-0008 51.801500 53.202250 [noise]
sw3040B-ms98-a-0009 53.202250 66.658875 [silence]
sw3040B-ms98-a-0010 66.658875 68.114375 yes
sw3040B-ms98-a-0011 68.114375 80.608250 well at this stage i think we've taxed property almost to the limit because like the the property taxes on the homes have reached the point that it's precluding people from being able to own a home
sw3040B-ms98-a-0012 80.608250 90.213500 because of the cost of the taxes on them i know i live in Richardson and it's up over two thousand dollars a year for taxes on my house
sw3040B-ms98-a-0013 90.213500 101.100000 but now we're getting public services the schools the hospitals and if it weren't for the taxes we're putting in there uh look what the schools could cost you
sw3040B-ms98-a-0014 101.100000 121.821750 [silence]
sw3040B-ms98-a-0015 121.821750 122.877000 yeah
sw3040B-ms98-a-0016 122.877000 134.376625 then again the the community college system here is excellent for the dollar spent and the p[ublic]- public colleges also the tuition has got to be among the lowest in the country
sw3040B-ms98-a-0017 134.376625 140.969625 uh one of the uh i believe i don't know which one it is uh down there whether it's Hobby or uh [noise]
sw3040B-ms98-a-0018 140.969625 153.505375 the other ex-governor down there that are proposing doubling the tuition well if you double the tuition it would still be considerably less than the public school tuition in most other states
sw3040B-ms98-a-0019 153.505375 156.268375 yeah that would provide uh
sw3040B-ms98-a-0020 156.268375 169.160875 possibly some relief there to utilize some of the property taxes for other things see the so called sin taxes on liquor and the cigarettes and such as that generate a considerable amount but
sw3040B-ms98-a-0021 169.160875 174.615500 i pay eventually i think you may tax people out of smoking even [laughter]
sw3040B-ms98-a-0022 174.615500 177.666875 [noise]
sw3040B-ms98-a-0023 177.666875 182.257375 yeah [laughter] well i quit ten years ago so [laughter]
sw3040B-ms98-a-0024 182.257375 185.273625 i couldn't afford to start again [laughter]
sw3040B-ms98-a-0025 185.273625 186.529375 [silence]
sw3040B-ms98-a-0026 186.529375 191.725750 i know uh my children would give up eating before they gave up their cigarettes i think
sw3040B-ms98-a-0027 191.725750 203.940500 but all the various t[axing]- taxing authorities that come through i think the one tax i resent the most though is the additional sales tax for DART which is probably never going to be in existence in my lifetime
sw3040B-ms98-a-0028 203.940500 215.523250 [silence]
sw3040B-ms98-a-0029 215.523250 226.420250 well this this is a thing i think it's like uh back east you had to start your public transportation when you started your cities you can't come in afterward and really be successful or economical at it
sw3040B-ms98-a-0030 226.420250 231.516875 if we had been like a Chicago or a New York City or Philadelphia or someone like that
sw3040B-ms98-a-0031 231.516875 245.468500 and had a public transportation system starting in the horse and buggy days and when land was cheap and uh construction costs were cheap you could afford it but now digging tunnels under Central Expressway and things like that becomes cost prohibitive
sw3040B-ms98-a-0032 245.468500 260.173375 [silence]
sw3040B-ms98-a-0033 260.173375 261.873125 absolutely
sw3040B-ms98-a-0034 261.873125 303.866375 [silence]
sw3040B-ms98-a-0035 303.866375 305.167750 yeah
sw3040B-ms98-a-0036 305.167750 316.084375 yeah just take like in Chicago where the people depend on the public transportation system to get them everywhere and new York and some people don't even own a car and know how to drive a car
sw3040B-ms98-a-0037 316.084375 329.760500 someone made the analogy uh with Texans as being like the old cowboys and their horse an old cowboy would jump on his horse to go across the street well most Texans will jump in their car to drive across the street
sw3040B-ms98-a-0038 329.760500 331.875000 and i'm just as guilty as anyone else
sw3040B-ms98-a-0039 331.875000 337.757750 i drive to work every day by myself uh without even even any thought of car pooling
sw3040B-ms98-a-0040 337.757750 340.986625 and uh most people are that way
sw3040B-ms98-a-0041 340.986625 344.730500 because they're used to not having public transportation
sw3040B-ms98-a-0042 344.730500 353.990500 so but i here again i think the thing i resented where they were collecting the sales tax for five years before they turned a spade of dirt
sw3040B-ms98-a-0043 353.990500 364.564250 so and doing all these studies and the things we saw about them traveling to San Francisco to see whether they wanted ten foot wide or twelve foot wide cars or something that
sw3040B-ms98-a-0044 364.564250 370.744500 [laughter] i felt that was a little uh wasteful use of the tax dollars that we were paying
sw3040B-ms98-a-0045 370.744500 371.801875 you know
sw3040B-ms98-a-0046 371.801875 373.553000 [silence]
sw3040B-ms98-a-0047 373.553000 376.519875 well that's about all i can say at this time
sw3040B-ms98-a-0048 376.519875 378.921125 okay it's been real nice talking with you
sw3040B-ms98-a-0049 378.921125 380.091875 bye
sw3040B-ms98-a-0050 380.091875 382.435875 [noise]
