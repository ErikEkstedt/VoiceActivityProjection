sw3033B-ms98-a-0042 243.258625 253.105875 you know assorted buttons and oh sometimes you got ten of a kind sometimes you got one of a kind but anyway i decided when i started making paper earrings maybe i'd branch out a little bit
sw3033B-ms98-a-0043 253.105875 260.590000 and i got out my button collection and there were a lot of things in there that i could make particularly the metal ones you know i could just put backs on them
sw3033B-ms98-a-0044 260.590000 269.900125 um i'd have to clip off the uh shanks and all but then some of them after i ran out of that i just started painting them with my uh sweatshirt paints
sw3033B-ms98-a-0045 269.900125 273.309000 and you know making things to match my outfits
