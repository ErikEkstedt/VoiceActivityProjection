sw3030B-ms98-a-0022 86.986125 96.005250 oh well that's much more reasonable i was involved in a a club like that for um that you know where we tried to really do gourmet uh meals and uh we
sw3030B-ms98-a-0023 96.005250 102.527000 we were a little bit too frequent i think i don't remember if we were once a month or anyway it was
sw3030B-ms98-a-0024 102.527000 112.460000 it was difficult by the time we went around it was uh four couples so uh by the time we got around uh to each of us and it was time again we were almost tired you know 
sw3030B-ms98-a-0025 112.460000 122.144125 um partly because um [vocalized-noise] gourmet cooking is not particularly conducive for regular dining it's too rich
sw3030B-ms98-a-0026 122.144125 127.657375 and so i- we found that while we enjoyed the evening we regretted it the next day
sw3030B-ms98-a-0027 127.657375 139.479250 um so uh we we kind of and then one of the couples uh moved and so we sort of didn't didn't continue it but um and i must admit that as you say when your children start taking up your time
sw3030B-ms98-a-0028 139.479250 147.266875 then you you don't have as much time for uh regular entertaining but um [vocalized-noise]
sw3030B-ms98-a-0029 147.266875 157.201250 when when we entertain i usually try to find something that would be [noise] um kind of good for everybody and that that sometimes means you can't do gourmet 
sw3030B-ms98-a-0030 157.201250 160.766875 because depending on who your guests are [vocalized-noise]
sw3030B-ms98-a-0031 160.766875 163.651000 [silence]
sw3030B-ms98-a-0032 163.651000 167.614625 oh yeah well one of my friends doesn't eat any cheese at all
sw3030B-ms98-a-0033 167.614625 178.517500 uh so that's a real problem because so many dishes require cheese uh well i take that back uh she can't eat some cream cheese but that that really limits um
sw3030B-ms98-a-0034 178.517500 180.115875 [silence]
