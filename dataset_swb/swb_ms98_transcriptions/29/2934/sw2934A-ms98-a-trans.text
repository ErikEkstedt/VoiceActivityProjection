sw2934A-ms98-a-0018 84.997250 99.772375 not really rationing water but just cutting down and uh it seems like uh you know the weather pattern is just shifting and uh that uh jet stream is moving uh into our area North Carolina
sw2934A-ms98-a-0019 99.772375 103.257875 and across but it's uh changing latitude
sw2934A-ms98-a-0020 103.257875 104.738625 [silence]

sw2934A-ms98-a-0028 138.974375 148.462375 um actually the uh the wind normally blows let's see let me think about this south southwest
sw2934A-ms98-a-0029 148.462375 154.719375 yeah uh but a[ctually]- but actually our i guess our weather pattern comes from the uh
sw2934A-ms98-a-0030 154.719375 159.493500 blows north east yeah you're right it blows north east

sw2934A-ms98-a-0043 223.222625 230.956000 but we'll probably have our share of the hurricanes i know uh Hurricane Hugo you probably heard about that uh last year
sw2934A-ms98-a-0044 230.956000 235.974500 yeah and they're still uh [noise] rebuilding from that storm
sw2934A-ms98-a-0045 235.974500 240.499125 so the the beaches here just get really beat up uh

sw2934A-ms98-a-0047 241.505875 243.812000 and it usually comes this way [laughter]
sw2934A-ms98-a-0048 243.812000 252.178875 it comes up from uh Miami uh down around or you know around the Bahamas and it usually travels uh northwest
sw2934A-ms98-a-0049 252.178875 256.591500 and uh it'll go up the coast quite a ways before it finally hits
sw2934A-ms98-a-0050 256.591500 260.276125 [silence]
sw2934A-ms98-a-0051 260.276125 274.454875 um let's see two years ago we had one as a matter of fact it went within a mile of my house and uh it was real odd the um barometric pressure drops during a tornado and our uh fire alarm went off
sw2934A-ms98-a-0052 274.454875 285.958875 [laughter-so] of course that woke everybody up and we knew what was going on to uh you know go downstairs or go into the bedroo[m]- bathroom and uh take cover but uh
sw2934A-ms98-a-0053 285.958875 290.695125 we get uh yeah we're we're uh we get our share of tornadoes

sw2934A-ms98-a-0055 297.460125 303.218875 no huh-uh we're about two hours from the beach so uh
sw2934A-ms98-a-0056 303.218875 316.220500 you know it's uh barometric pressure i believe is higher in the mountains and we ca[tch]- we catch some winds you know a few winds coming off of them_1 i think but uh let's see y'all just had a tornado
sw2934A-ms98-a-0057 316.220500 319.956500 uh over close to Oklahoma and Texas

sw2934A-ms98-a-0073 388.186000 398.987000 and watch them_1 come out of the sky through the funnel clouds and the only time we got worried is if it hit the ground but otherwise we'd just sit back there and watch them_1 go in and out of those clouds
sw2934A-ms98-a-0074 398.987000 400.296500 [silence]
