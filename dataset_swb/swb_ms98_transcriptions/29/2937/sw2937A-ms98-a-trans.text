sw2937A-ms98-a-0022 90.634125 98.452375 so it's just names on the check so no one can you know i mean they can i suppose with a little leg work if they wanted to
sw2937A-ms98-a-0023 98.452375 101.251250 but the average person's not going to do that anyhow
sw2937A-ms98-a-0024 101.251250 107.632250 [silence]
sw2937A-ms98-a-0025 107.632250 108.941750 okay

sw2937A-ms98-a-0028 128.278875 131.107375 oh okay that's yeah i
sw2937A-ms98-a-0029 131.107375 141.720000 i've read articles about that but people have to be pretty gullible um either that or or especially widows um
sw2937A-ms98-a-0030 141.720000 144.238125 [silence]
sw2937A-ms98-a-0031 144.238125 146.323375 old people
sw2937A-ms98-a-0032 146.323375 147.882875 right
sw2937A-ms98-a-0033 147.882875 160.949000 and and some people some of the older people today uh their husband's handled all the finances so now they find themselves left out in the cold and they're really really not savvy as far as it comes to fi[nances]- to handling their own personal affairs 
sw2937A-ms98-a-0034 160.949000 172.879625 [silence]

sw2937A-ms98-a-0036 174.525625 177.228750 i'm i'm still not convinced that
sw2937A-ms98-a-0037 177.228750 184.910250 they can get you if you're if you're aware first of all you never should give your your uh credit card numbers over the phone to anyone
sw2937A-ms98-a-0038 184.910250 187.481250 which is which is kind of basic
sw2937A-ms98-a-0039 187.481250 188.473500 um
sw2937A-ms98-a-0040 188.473500 199.888250 they people may generate lists are if you subscribe to a magazine i guess they sell lists of names to other people but they'll send you junk mail usually
sw2937A-ms98-a-0041 199.888250 205.277500 um and you can stop that easy enough just go to the post office and just have your name taken off
sw2937A-ms98-a-0042 205.277500 208.847500 [silence]
sw2937A-ms98-a-0043 208.847500 210.927125 uh yes i have

sw2937A-ms98-a-0053 257.671875 259.424125 yeah right
sw2937A-ms98-a-0054 259.424125 266.450250 yes they do exist and if someone wants to really find out about you i suppose if they wanted to go to all that trouble they could
sw2937A-ms98-a-0055 266.450250 268.033125 uh
sw2937A-ms98-a-0056 268.033125 287.272375 [silence]

sw2937A-ms98-a-0060 310.143625 313.141750 yeah you could do that if you really wanted to
sw2937A-ms98-a-0061 313.141750 314.174750 yeah
sw2937A-ms98-a-0062 314.174750 324.200500 [silence]
sw2937A-ms98-a-0063 324.200500 326.523750 right yeah
sw2937A-ms98-a-0064 326.523750 328.534625 [silence]
sw2937A-ms98-a-0065 328.534625 329.762875 yeah

sw2937A-ms98-a-0067 330.815750 331.807250 yeah
sw2937A-ms98-a-0068 331.807250 342.369500 that's and you can do that anyone can do anything that's public record whether it's divorce or anything like that um whether you purchase a home that's all that's all public record
sw2937A-ms98-a-0069 342.369500 346.362000 um what they do with that information people are really
sw2937A-ms98-a-0070 346.362000 352.124125 um go out and do it i suppose somebody does the leg work and they and they generate a list 
sw2937A-ms98-a-0071 352.124125 353.279375 um
sw2937A-ms98-a-0072 353.279375 354.494000 [silence]
sw2937A-ms98-a-0073 354.494000 358.659375 uh it's uh [noise] i think lists are generated from lists now
sw2937A-ms98-a-0074 358.659375 359.723250 [silence]
sw2937A-ms98-a-0075 359.723250 360.693375 and
sw2937A-ms98-a-0076 360.693375 363.578125 [silence]
sw2937A-ms98-a-0077 363.578125 364.848625 right
sw2937A-ms98-a-0078 364.848625 368.055250 [silence]
sw2937A-ms98-a-0079 368.055250 372.114625 yeah we had uh we've got a an account at Sears Roebuck
sw2937A-ms98-a-0080 372.114625 382.852625 and we had moved from one town to another town and they've got our address listed now with with double towns in it and i've tried and tried and tried to get it off but you just can't get it so
sw2937A-ms98-a-0081 382.852625 393.262375 since then we've gotten solicitations from other people listing both towns so i know damn well that Sears has sold their list of names out to somebody else
sw2937A-ms98-a-0082 393.262375 396.043625 but there isn't anything you can do about that
sw2937A-ms98-a-0083 396.043625 404.585375 [silence]
sw2937A-ms98-a-0084 404.585375 410.974125 right some of the some of the charities now will will do that if you chose choose not to have you[r]- your name
sw2937A-ms98-a-0085 410.974125 417.162625 put on a list and i- i do that you know we have our charities that we give to and then we say yes no just don't
sw2937A-ms98-a-0086 417.162625 421.074250 because you do it and then you're on everybody's charity list
sw2937A-ms98-a-0087 421.074250 431.330375 [silence]
sw2937A-ms98-a-0088 431.330375 436.886875 that's right that's exactly right uh most of the funds that a lot of these organizations collect
sw2937A-ms98-a-0089 436.886875 440.474500 go to fund the organization i mean very very
sw2937A-ms98-a-0090 440.474500 444.589125 little of the funds get out to do uh anything worthwhile
sw2937A-ms98-a-0091 444.589125 445.917125 um
sw2937A-ms98-a-0092 445.917125 447.091625 [silence]
sw2937A-ms98-a-0093 447.091625 449.329625 it all started with the government
sw2937A-ms98-a-0094 449.329625 452.299750 the government started keeping tabs on you and whether they
sw2937A-ms98-a-0095 452.299750 461.036125 those list that Internal Revenue has whether they leak out to the public or not i'm really not sure maybe in some cases they have in the past
sw2937A-ms98-a-0096 461.036125 463.778875 uh once a list is out it's out forever
sw2937A-ms98-a-0097 463.778875 471.499875 [silence]
sw2937A-ms98-a-0098 471.499875 473.181625 yeah
sw2937A-ms98-a-0099 473.181625 475.882750 but the bulk of it probably
sw2937A-ms98-a-0100 475.882750 476.900000 [silence]
sw2937A-ms98-a-0101 476.900000 486.629125 ninety seven to ninety eight percent of all those lists are going just for solicitations um some people maybe are using them for ulterior motives i'm not really sure
sw2937A-ms98-a-0102 486.629125 494.218250 but the bulk of them_1 is and it's junk mail and you can you can you can get off those junk mail lists you just tell the post office
sw2937A-ms98-a-0103 494.218250 497.297625 so that will limit that amount of stuff
sw2937A-ms98-a-0104 497.297625 501.433250 i read uh i read and article where this this man
sw2937A-ms98-a-0105 501.433250 506.320000 uh se[nt]- sent to everything they could possibly get and he was getting
sw2937A-ms98-a-0106 506.320000 517.008250 reams and reams of paper all kinds of periodicals and magazines and letters and notifications and what he was doing with them he was storing them up and he was using them for fuel
sw2937A-ms98-a-0107 517.008250 518.395250 [laughter]
sw2937A-ms98-a-0108 518.395250 520.316000 during the winter time
sw2937A-ms98-a-0109 520.316000 526.598875 what i do is on all the credit card solicitations
sw2937A-ms98-a-0110 526.598875 534.539625 if they have a return envelope with it i write across the face of it no thank you your rates are too high and i mail it back to them_1
sw2937A-ms98-a-0111 534.539625 539.366250 because now they have to pay the postage so now it's costing them something to do that
sw2937A-ms98-a-0112 539.366250 541.403375 [silence]
sw2937A-ms98-a-0113 541.403375 542.841750 they don't
sw2937A-ms98-a-0114 542.841750 543.946375 [silence]
sw2937A-ms98-a-0115 543.946375 553.276125 oh up here they do well they're still doing it well it's just like up here we don't there's very very few times i've had to show my driver's license for to use a credit card
sw2937A-ms98-a-0116 553.276125 556.071500 uh and i'm not sure why
sw2937A-ms98-a-0117 556.071500 558.726000 you know why it's so prevalent down there and
sw2937A-ms98-a-0118 558.726000 561.204375 maybe it will catch up up here
sw2937A-ms98-a-0119 561.204375 572.512750 [silence]
sw2937A-ms98-a-0120 572.512750 574.519375 yeah we've got the
sw2937A-ms98-a-0121 574.519375 577.841875 [silence]
sw2937A-ms98-a-0122 577.841875 580.530875 we've got the ones you just stick your card in the pump
sw2937A-ms98-a-0123 580.530875 582.720875 [silence]
sw2937A-ms98-a-0124 582.720875 594.107625 yeah so whatever you whatever brand that you buy you just drive up to the pump you put your credit card in it and then it says you know please commence pumping and then when you pump then when you're through
sw2937A-ms98-a-0125 594.107625 599.820000 you put the nozzle back and it says do you want a receipt and if you can push yes if you want one and if you don't want one you push no
