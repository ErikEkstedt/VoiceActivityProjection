sw2951B-ms98-a-0064 274.002375 276.938625 if you can heed to advice given
sw2951B-ms98-a-0065 276.938625 286.738250 [silence]

sw2951B-ms98-a-0072 318.062750 321.264875 oh credit cards are you know really a blessing
sw2951B-ms98-a-0073 321.264875 324.275625 uh but you have to be wise when you use them_1
sw2951B-ms98-a-0074 324.275625 331.142625 and uh i have nothing against them other than you know people abusing it and then they get themselves in hot water and
sw2951B-ms98-a-0075 331.142625 333.588000 you know they're just hurting theirselves
sw2951B-ms98-a-0076 333.588000 340.063875 and when you uh have a bankruptcy uh it takes you i think about eight years to wipe that off your record
sw2951B-ms98-a-0077 340.063875 345.776000 and so you know that is the shame about that is uh and people won't touch you
sw2951B-ms98-a-0078 345.776000 347.903500 and you've got to live that down
sw2951B-ms98-a-0079 347.903500 349.739875 [silence]
sw2951B-ms98-a-0080 349.739875 356.481125 so you have to be very cautious about how you use your credit i mean it is a wonderful thing but don't abuse it
sw2951B-ms98-a-0081 356.481125 360.072500 [silence]

sw2951B-ms98-a-0084 364.601625 366.175750 sure
sw2951B-ms98-a-0085 366.175750 374.892125 [silence]
sw2951B-ms98-a-0086 374.892125 376.444000 that's right
sw2951B-ms98-a-0087 376.444000 386.747125 [silence]
sw2951B-ms98-a-0088 386.747125 391.544875 well there is a lot of people that uh know exactly what they are doing
sw2951B-ms98-a-0089 391.544875 397.764000 and they will run into thousands and thousands of dollars into debt
sw2951B-ms98-a-0090 397.764000 401.533000 and they will deliberately do this so that they can go into bankruptcy
sw2951B-ms98-a-0091 401.533000 402.613250 [silence]
sw2951B-ms98-a-0092 402.613250 409.323250 and they they have a way of uh diverting all of the things that they've bought and put it like in hiding
sw2951B-ms98-a-0093 409.323250 419.021000 no i've heard uh uh there was a radio program in Dallas that we listen to and i well it in fact it's nationwide 
sw2951B-ms98-a-0094 419.021000 424.543625 and i was shocked at some of the stories that came out of that uh program about
sw2951B-ms98-a-0095 424.543625 429.741750 these people that really you know they bought all these wonderful things
sw2951B-ms98-a-0096 429.741750 432.047375 and then they went bankrupt
sw2951B-ms98-a-0097 432.047375 433.102375 [silence]
sw2951B-ms98-a-0098 433.102375 437.678125 and they knew that yes they knew that they were going to do that and they just um-hum
sw2951B-ms98-a-0099 437.678125 443.241125 and uh they said you know it was worth the uh jeopardizing their credit for that amount of time
sw2951B-ms98-a-0100 443.241125 446.904875 because they still had the stuff you know and they could write it off
sw2951B-ms98-a-0101 446.904875 453.348750 you know they can only um be responsible for a certain percent and not the full uh amount that they owed
sw2951B-ms98-a-0102 453.348750 454.601250 [silence]
sw2951B-ms98-a-0103 454.601250 456.535375 and i don't know who um 
sw2951B-ms98-a-0104 456.535375 462.150000 determines uh the percentage rate that they have to repay but it is not surely
sw2951B-ms98-a-0105 462.150000 464.373375 what they are were indebted for
sw2951B-ms98-a-0106 464.373375 465.915500 um-hum
sw2951B-ms98-a-0107 465.915500 469.484500 so it it they use it as a scam
sw2951B-ms98-a-0108 469.484500 471.548875 instead of uh
sw2951B-ms98-a-0109 471.548875 474.714750 to me they were criminals and they used th[at]- that
sw2951B-ms98-a-0110 474.714750 475.917625 [silence]
sw2951B-ms98-a-0111 475.917625 478.403000 in a in a really bad situation

sw2951B-ms98-a-0113 479.488750 484.366500 and that has kind of snowballed i guess around so i do not know maybe the courts and lawyers are
sw2951B-ms98-a-0114 484.366500 489.354500 working on that to co[ver]- you know cover all the loopholes that might exist
sw2951B-ms98-a-0115 489.354500 490.732625 [silence]
sw2951B-ms98-a-0116 490.732625 494.218500 but i've never been in that situation and hope i never have to be
