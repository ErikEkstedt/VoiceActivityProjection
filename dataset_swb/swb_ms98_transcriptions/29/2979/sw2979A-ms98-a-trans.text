sw2979A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 9.108375 some of the the more recent uh changes that i've noticed in society is i guess over the last ten to twenty years or maybe the
sw2979A-ms98-a-0002 9.108375 15.178625 technological advances you know ten to twenty years ago there wasn't a VCR in every home and there wasn't uh
sw2979A-ms98-a-0003 15.178625 16.912000 s[ome]- some of the
sw2979A-ms98-a-0004 16.912000 18.756000 [laughter]
sw2979A-ms98-a-0005 18.756000 20.043750 [silence]
sw2979A-ms98-a-0006 20.043750 32.068500 uh that's true yeah and the old remote controls that were all by sound and you could drop a coin or clang some dishes and turn off the TV or change [laughter-channels] and all the things that have changed over the years
sw2979A-ms98-a-0007 32.068500 43.921750 but along with that i unfortunately i guess there's been a down side to a lot of that stuff i mean another three or four years you're going to have a land fill full of VCR's that and the parts and things that don't work and
sw2979A-ms98-a-0008 43.921750 56.292750 a lot of those things just don't go away and uh i guess the [noise] environmentalists have done their jobs that ten to twenty years ago i didn't think of it that much i knew about all the the uh
sw2979A-ms98-a-0009 56.292750 69.188875 organizations that tried to do that for a living you know let you know what what environmental impact was but just kind of recently uh the world's waking up to that so that's a change that's come along
sw2979A-ms98-a-0010 69.188875 75.746000 [silence]
sw2979A-ms98-a-0011 75.746000 77.583500 yeah yeah
sw2979A-ms98-a-0012 77.583500 79.985500 [silence]
sw2979A-ms98-a-0013 79.985500 91.004000 no no never got around as it were but i uh i paid attention to it all being there so that that has changed people are uh i think the
sw2979A-ms98-a-0014 91.004000 105.917500 the outspoken people people who make a difference and make a change that age has come down it seems like uh you can make a difference at a younger age these days you don't have to be a an older part of the establishment to make waves
sw2979A-ms98-a-0015 105.917500 118.254500 [silence]
sw2979A-ms98-a-0016 118.254500 121.358000 oh yeah yeah
sw2979A-ms98-a-0017 121.358000 123.199375 [silence]
sw2979A-ms98-a-0018 123.199375 129.346250 it's true they can uh they can make quite a difference at no matter what the age nowadays
sw2979A-ms98-a-0019 129.346250 139.728750 plus there seems to be uh uh there's a few negative changes that have come along i was just thinking last night how different uh my kids' childhood is from uh
sw2979A-ms98-a-0020 139.728750 151.685375 when i grew up i i was allowed pretty much a free rein around my house to ride my bike uh you know all several blocks away even at the age of of ten or eleven years old i could ride
sw2979A-ms98-a-0021 151.685375 156.849000 a couple of miles away i'd ride to school you know and it was it was right at two miles away from the house
sw2979A-ms98-a-0022 156.849000 166.521000 whereas here uh yeah i won't let them_1 [laughter-go] you know more than a block out of my sight there i['m]- just a little too paranoid these days with what's going on and uh
sw2979A-ms98-a-0023 166.521000 180.349250 yeah we get you know reports from the police will give us warnings about this neighborhood and some activity that's occurring there and then you know occasionally it works its way around to our neighborhood and we have to keep a real close rein on them_1 won't even let them_1 go out of our sight for a while and then
sw2979A-ms98-a-0024 180.349250 186.651125 after they catch that guy you know you can let him go out for a while but it's uh it's kind of sad
sw2979A-ms98-a-0025 186.651125 195.758250 i've got a nine year old and a seven year old and uh they both like to ride their bikes off into never never land and you know be
sw2979A-ms98-a-0026 195.758250 199.736250 [silence]
sw2979A-ms98-a-0027 199.736250 201.163750 um-hum
sw2979A-ms98-a-0028 201.163750 204.949125 [silence]
sw2979A-ms98-a-0029 204.949125 210.473125 yeah i used to uh i grew up in kind of a good combination of between the country and the city
sw2979A-ms98-a-0030 210.473125 219.556375 uh in East Texas and i had while we were in town we'd ride several miles away like to school and the like but when we were in the country we would ride
sw2979A-ms98-a-0031 219.556375 231.738875 ten twelve miles away we'd spend a whole day just two or three of us get together and take a lunch and go ride somewhere and eat lunch and come back and you know as long as we told the parents what roads we were going to be on and if there any
sw2979A-ms98-a-0032 231.738875 243.640375 trouble was they could come find us but uh can't do that now [laughter] just no safe place to let your kid go that long and of course it probably wasn't that good of an idea back then either it just uh
sw2979A-ms98-a-0033 243.640375 251.782625 [silence]
sw2979A-ms98-a-0034 251.782625 253.327000 um-hum
sw2979A-ms98-a-0035 253.327000 257.651125 [silence]
sw2979A-ms98-a-0036 257.651125 258.994500 right
sw2979A-ms98-a-0037 258.994500 262.509625 [silence]
sw2979A-ms98-a-0038 262.509625 270.406500 you know they they're saying that the uh uh the education is going to be enough or at least a major part of the drug [deterrment/deterrent]
sw2979A-ms98-a-0039 270.406500 280.329375 and though i remember when i was in school they had a a drug awareness week type deal that we studied in the science classes and we got little posters and we did all sorts of stuff but
sw2979A-ms98-a-0040 280.329375 289.649625 that was nothing compared to the you know campaigns that are going on now but i guess it's just the the class of people or the area that we're in but
sw2979A-ms98-a-0041 289.649625 292.632250 i i'm not in contact with any kids
sw2979A-ms98-a-0042 292.632250 302.116875 that think it's i[t's]- i[t's]- it's a positive thing to do i mean it is it is really looked down upon even to the point of smoking i mean tha[t]- my kids are so ingrained 
sw2979A-ms98-a-0043 302.116875 313.820000 that they look down on them_1 we have to tell them_1 you know don't say anything in public to a stranger about his [laughter-smoking] you know not not quite that's not quite accepted yet now if he's in a nonsmoking area you might want to say something but
sw2979A-ms98-a-0044 313.820000 317.398750 they uh they're so outspoken on the topic that uh
sw2979A-ms98-a-0045 317.398750 318.012000 [noise]
sw2979A-ms98-a-0046 318.012000 320.700375 it's an interesting change in attitudes
sw2979A-ms98-a-0047 320.700375 324.662875 there's coming coming along with the education
sw2979A-ms98-a-0048 324.662875 326.146375 yeah
sw2979A-ms98-a-0049 326.146375 327.194500 [silence]
sw2979A-ms98-a-0050 327.194500 328.450125 yep
sw2979A-ms98-a-0051 328.450125 339.206750 [silence]
sw2979A-ms98-a-0052 339.206750 347.190875 yeah it won't take but a like uh maybe generation or so before it uh i[t]- it no longer the cool thing to do i don't know
sw2979A-ms98-a-0053 347.190875 351.138750 hopefully hopefully we can get away from it yeah
sw2979A-ms98-a-0054 351.138750 356.572500 it's quite an expense too now they keep deciding that's the thing to tax [laughter]
sw2979A-ms98-a-0055 356.572500 358.414500 [silence]
sw2979A-ms98-a-0056 358.414500 364.667375 yeah it keeps going up and up well i guess there's uh
sw2979A-ms98-a-0057 364.667375 376.954875 it's i don't know of any other major changes other than the political environment course that things are no longer the cold war scares and the things that are going on that realm and Russia's no longer the major enemy and
sw2979A-ms98-a-0058 376.954875 384.085875 i i don't know if there is one one easy one to uh to pick that's part of the problem
sw2979A-ms98-a-0059 384.085875 386.648625 [silence]
sw2979A-ms98-a-0060 386.648625 388.768750 yeah yeah
sw2979A-ms98-a-0061 388.768750 393.081250 [silence]
sw2979A-ms98-a-0062 393.081250 396.341250 they probably still do as far as humans go
sw2979A-ms98-a-0063 396.341250 398.820000 [silence]
sw2979A-ms98-a-0064 398.820000 412.338500 of course there you wouldn't be able to go over and attack them but i don't know that they'd be able to go anywhere and attack us [laughter] they can't get all those people across the sea they don't have the ships to get them_1 anywhere so they may have a huge army but it's going to stay put
sw2979A-ms98-a-0065 412.338500 418.881875 uh it's kind of an interesting uh interesting problem not having any one enemy to focus on as a society
sw2979A-ms98-a-0066 418.881875 431.672375 tends to uh let that go out of the mind you're no longer concerned with the the weapon systems and the the defense area so now that Russia's gone as a major focused on enemy uh
sw2979A-ms98-a-0067 431.672375 436.061375 that whole defense issue is just not quite as important to people's lives
sw2979A-ms98-a-0068 436.061375 440.177250 so that's an an interesting social change i guess
sw2979A-ms98-a-0069 440.177250 447.468500 course it'll surprise them_1 some day when when all the hostilities start back up and some people aren't prepared for it [laughter] so
sw2979A-ms98-a-0070 447.468500 449.627375 [noise]
