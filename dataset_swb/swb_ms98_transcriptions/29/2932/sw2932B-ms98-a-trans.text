sw2932B-ms98-a-0002 1.334000 6.906000 [silence]
sw2932B-ms98-a-0003 6.906000 11.145000 okay i live in Plano in a uh four bedroom
sw2932B-ms98-a-0004 11.145000 17.809625 two bath house which is the area's dominantly three bedroom two bath
sw2932B-ms98-a-0005 17.809625 21.376250 so i'm just a little bit different than typical
sw2932B-ms98-a-0006 21.376250 22.771750 uh
sw2932B-ms98-a-0007 22.771750 24.245375 and of course
sw2932B-ms98-a-0008 24.245375 27.536250 the Plano area is basically with alleyways
sw2932B-ms98-a-0009 27.536250 29.827500 so everything around here is
sw2932B-ms98-a-0010 29.827500 31.988250 set up that way
sw2932B-ms98-a-0011 31.988250 41.494000 which i think is l[ittle]- a little bit different than most areas in the houses the way they're constructed and it's a brick house with uh some wood
sw2932B-ms98-a-0012 41.494000 46.476375 it's real nice i like it [laughter] how about you
sw2932B-ms98-a-0013 46.476375 87.508500 [silence]
sw2932B-ms98-a-0014 87.508500 90.736750 are most of the houses in your area three bedroom two bath
sw2932B-ms98-a-0015 90.736750 93.098500 [silence]
sw2932B-ms98-a-0016 93.098500 95.877875 [laughter]
sw2932B-ms98-a-0017 95.877875 110.720250 [silence]
sw2932B-ms98-a-0018 110.720250 112.334375 yeah me too
sw2932B-ms98-a-0019 112.334375 114.311375 [silence]
sw2932B-ms98-a-0020 114.311375 119.000375 the only thing about mine um i think there's probably about
sw2932B-ms98-a-0021 119.000375 128.959250 oh when i go down the street i can just pick out houses that are that are identical to mine and usually they are the four bedroom
sw2932B-ms98-a-0022 128.959250 132.069875 um but they're spaced out
sw2932B-ms98-a-0023 132.069875 137.527125 oh i'd say maybe three or two block period
sw2932B-ms98-a-0024 137.527125 141.300875 because it's all different builders up here
sw2932B-ms98-a-0025 141.300875 146.082500 so it's kind of hard at that point to you know classify some of the builders
sw2932B-ms98-a-0026 146.082500 149.223125 but most of the builders all built three two
sw2932B-ms98-a-0027 149.223125 157.353000 but the one thing my house is a little bit different and i can pick it out again because it's not typical is i've got the
sw2932B-ms98-a-0028 157.353000 159.527375 oh what do you call it a uh
sw2932B-ms98-a-0029 159.527375 162.309250 double ceiling double high
sw2932B-ms98-a-0030 162.309250 164.251625 in one half of the house
sw2932B-ms98-a-0031 164.251625 166.806750 so like the den and the living room
sw2932B-ms98-a-0032 166.806750 170.947625 are all double cathedral ceilings
sw2932B-ms98-a-0033 170.947625 174.839750 and uh the kitchen is norm and the bedrooms are norm
sw2932B-ms98-a-0034 174.839750 177.691250 so it just goes down the dining room
sw2932B-ms98-a-0035 177.691250 179.822625 the family room and the living room that way
sw2932B-ms98-a-0036 179.822625 181.689250 and i love the space
sw2932B-ms98-a-0037 181.689250 183.232000 it just
sw2932B-ms98-a-0038 183.232000 185.703500 it's uh luckily
sw2932B-ms98-a-0039 185.703500 189.310250 i came from a house in Colorado which had the cathedral ceilings
sw2932B-ms98-a-0040 189.310250 195.510125 and i just lucked out and walked into this one and of course i felt the same airy feeling which i liked it real well
sw2932B-ms98-a-0041 195.510125 198.090000 so it's a nice thing to move into but
sw2932B-ms98-a-0042 198.090000 200.859750 again it's not typical in this area
sw2932B-ms98-a-0043 200.859750 205.006000 you can just spot them_1 because the cei[ling]- the roof is so high much higher
sw2932B-ms98-a-0044 205.006000 207.413750 but uh
sw2932B-ms98-a-0045 207.413750 223.085750 [silence]
sw2932B-ms98-a-0046 223.085750 225.001875 yeah
sw2932B-ms98-a-0047 225.001875 228.350875 well it's like when my son goes up into the [noise]
sw2932B-ms98-a-0048 228.350875 242.909125 up into the furnace area over the garage he can walk and he's six foot and he says oh come on up mom i'm not going up there [laughter] i'm [laughter-not] [laughter-going] [laughter-up] [laughter-there] but he says there's plenty of room up there for a room
sw2932B-ms98-a-0049 242.909125 246.003125 so that means if i knock out the wall
sw2932B-ms98-a-0050 246.003125 251.158250 in my family room i could make another room overlooking my family room from upstairs
sw2932B-ms98-a-0051 251.158250 252.658125 with no problem
sw2932B-ms98-a-0052 252.658125 256.055375 but um i'm not that ambitious
sw2932B-ms98-a-0053 256.055375 258.478875 i tol[d]- maybe someday
sw2932B-ms98-a-0054 258.478875 264.266875 when i feel really ambitious and then get angry i'll start poking holes up there but until that [laughter-time]
sw2932B-ms98-a-0055 264.266875 271.156375 but uh i've noticed the houses around here are basically it's one story
sw2932B-ms98-a-0056 271.156375 273.920375 and they're all basically two
sw2932B-ms98-a-0057 273.920375 278.016000 uh bath two uh with three bedrooms
sw2932B-ms98-a-0058 278.016000 281.218875 and we're ninety i would say about
sw2932B-ms98-a-0059 281.218875 289.763250 oh about ninety five percent of them no i guess may[be]- probably a hundred percent of them_1 all are mostly brick
sw2932B-ms98-a-0060 289.763250 292.398875 uh with some wood
sw2932B-ms98-a-0061 292.398875 293.912625 but
sw2932B-ms98-a-0062 293.912625 299.851125 it's basically all brick the next subdivision over from me is total brick
sw2932B-ms98-a-0063 299.851125 302.610125 and the one on the other side of me
sw2932B-ms98-a-0064 302.610125 304.968875 is about the same as mine
sw2932B-ms98-a-0065 304.968875 313.446625 but uh the one on opposite the street now they're total brick and they're basically almost all three two
sw2932B-ms98-a-0066 313.446625 315.280750 they're all three two
sw2932B-ms98-a-0067 315.280750 321.835250 but of course they have a little river going down their area too which is kind [laughter-of] [laughter-nice]
sw2932B-ms98-a-0068 321.835250 331.074500 [silence]
sw2932B-ms98-a-0069 331.074500 334.457625 no it's a creek they've put little fountains in and such
sw2932B-ms98-a-0070 334.457625 345.717250 [silence]
sw2932B-ms98-a-0071 345.717250 347.193875 oh
sw2932B-ms98-a-0072 347.193875 354.058750 [silence]
sw2932B-ms98-a-0073 354.058750 359.077000 do you have a lot of property i mean a lot of yard around your house now in Denton
sw2932B-ms98-a-0074 359.077000 380.856125 [silence]
sw2932B-ms98-a-0075 380.856125 390.701500 yeah when you get down closer in to the newer track homes you find almost like there's no lot line at all they're built practically on top of each other
sw2932B-ms98-a-0076 390.701500 392.352000 [silence]
sw2932B-ms98-a-0077 392.352000 393.773000 i know i was
sw2932B-ms98-a-0078 393.773000 411.240875 [silence]
sw2932B-ms98-a-0079 411.240875 412.933125 um-hum
sw2932B-ms98-a-0080 412.933125 416.297125 well this subdivision here has got
sw2932B-ms98-a-0081 416.297125 418.999500 oh there's enough to put
sw2932B-ms98-a-0082 418.999500 421.580500 oh i'd say uh
sw2932B-ms98-a-0083 421.580500 427.119875 what twelve feet between each house on each side well i've got more on one side than i've got on the other
sw2932B-ms98-a-0084 427.119875 433.501500 but i'm like you i came down from Colorado and there was more land up there around the yard
sw2932B-ms98-a-0085 433.501500 443.425750 with a big full back yard which here i look out my back yard and i can see the gate i mean the fence is right there i mean just don't run too fast or you'll hit it
sw2932B-ms98-a-0086 443.425750 445.378375 and i'm not used to that either
sw2932B-ms98-a-0087 445.378375 449.775000 i mean i could see people putting swimming pools in the back yard all around me but
sw2932B-ms98-a-0088 449.775000 453.761625 to me you put the swimming pool in your back yard and you've lost your back yard
sw2932B-ms98-a-0089 453.761625 458.132500 i mean uh sure i mean you've got a little place on one side or the other but
sw2932B-ms98-a-0090 458.132500 463.464500 but to me their not that big enough for a pool but you know they're going up so
sw2932B-ms98-a-0091 463.464500 465.469125 but it's uh
sw2932B-ms98-a-0092 465.469125 469.240125 it's great for mowing [laughter]
sw2932B-ms98-a-0093 469.240125 478.685625 [laughter] [laughter-oh] [laughter-yeah] yeah [laughter]
sw2932B-ms98-a-0094 478.685625 487.331750 but yes i'm used to uh walking out the back yard and you can play catch across the back yard and you've got plenty of room to even play a small game of baseball but
sw2932B-ms98-a-0095 487.331750 489.522125 don't do it around here
sw2932B-ms98-a-0096 489.522125 512.969375 [silence]
sw2932B-ms98-a-0097 512.969375 515.289125 [laughter]
sw2932B-ms98-a-0098 515.289125 517.608875 [laughter] i hadn't thought about it that way
sw2932B-ms98-a-0099 517.608875 523.798875 [silence]
sw2932B-ms98-a-0100 523.798875 537.147000 it ju[st]- well see now with our jobs mainly hitting downtown Dallas we couldn't go too much further but we [vocalized-noise] we went that way it was the schools and the
sw2932B-ms98-a-0101 537.147000 548.469625 cost of houses so we kept going out until we figured we hit a point where we need the traffic time to get into work and that's where we stopped it was the thing same problem
sw2932B-ms98-a-0102 548.469625 551.685875 but i think Plano is so very different
sw2932B-ms98-a-0103 551.685875 554.649250 i got laid off by TI
sw2932B-ms98-a-0104 554.649250 561.855750 [laughter]
sw2932B-ms98-a-0105 561.855750 563.090125 oh i
sw2932B-ms98-a-0106 563.090125 564.846625 y[eah]- 
sw2932B-ms98-a-0107 564.846625 567.457125 no i was working at the Dallas site
sw2932B-ms98-a-0108 567.457125 569.977875 my ex-husband was working downtown
sw2932B-ms98-a-0109 569.977875 572.890375 but i uh uh
sw2932B-ms98-a-0110 572.890375 578.522125 no TI as far as i'm concerned they've been great as far as layoffs is concerned so i have no p[roblems]- problems
sw2932B-ms98-a-0111 578.522125 589.410875 but as far as the housing i would like personally i would like to move out of a four bedroom house and go with something smaller but prices in Plano there isn't um
sw2932B-ms98-a-0112 589.410875 590.673375 [silence]
sw2932B-ms98-a-0113 590.673375 594.832375 there isn't a section in Plano you can really move to without getting caught
sw2932B-ms98-a-0114 594.832375 596.252500 and uh
sw2932B-ms98-a-0115 596.252500 597.496500 if
sw2932B-ms98-a-0116 597.496500 599.787000 my price right now for what i pay
