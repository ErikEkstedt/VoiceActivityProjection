sw2940A-ms98-a-0002 0.038500 1.466625 okay
sw2940A-ms98-a-0003 1.466625 5.091000 are you currently active in any type of exercise program 
sw2940A-ms98-a-0004 5.091000 6.746000 you're not
sw2940A-ms98-a-0005 6.746000 8.115625 [laughter]
sw2940A-ms98-a-0006 8.115625 13.624375 [silence]
sw2940A-ms98-a-0007 13.624375 14.826500 is that right
sw2940A-ms98-a-0008 14.826500 17.808750 [silence]
sw2940A-ms98-a-0009 17.808750 19.618125 doesn't require exercise
sw2940A-ms98-a-0010 19.618125 20.969125 [silence]
sw2940A-ms98-a-0011 20.969125 24.213125 i- i wish i had such luck
sw2940A-ms98-a-0012 24.213125 27.539125 [silence]
sw2940A-ms98-a-0013 27.539125 29.910750 my wife is that way i uh
sw2940A-ms98-a-0014 29.910750 40.155000 course i've always uh i've always been in fairly good condition but and i do exercise uh [vocalized-noise] lately i've been off of it because i've had shoulder problems but uh 
sw2940A-ms98-a-0015 40.155000 44.863500 that seems to be on the mend and i think i'm pretty close to getting back on a program again
sw2940A-ms98-a-0016 44.863500 58.197250 [silence]
sw2940A-ms98-a-0017 58.197250 65.656375 i do notice as i get older i- i tend to i you know i don't exercise like i like i used to
sw2940A-ms98-a-0018 65.656375 70.998500 and it's much much harder for me to control you know the few pounds here and there
sw2940A-ms98-a-0019 70.998500 75.470125 so whenever i do have to lose five or ten pounds whatever it's a major effort
sw2940A-ms98-a-0020 75.470125 79.153625 whereas i could used to just lay off two or three meals uh
sw2940A-ms98-a-0021 79.153625 83.414125 you know for a day or so and then you know i could lose you know five pounds
sw2940A-ms98-a-0022 83.414125 87.588750 now i'd have to do that for two [laughter-solid] weeks before i'd lose five pounds so
sw2940A-ms98-a-0023 87.588750 103.626125 [silence]
sw2940A-ms98-a-0024 103.626125 108.900250 um i think it's important when they when they talk about you know getting your heart rate up and
sw2940A-ms98-a-0025 108.900250 133.799250 [silence]
sw2940A-ms98-a-0026 133.799250 136.191000 nine
sw2940A-ms98-a-0027 136.191000 141.748375 [silence]
sw2940A-ms98-a-0028 141.748375 147.794375 i used to run uh you know quite heavy i used to i used to run like three and maybe four miles
sw2940A-ms98-a-0029 147.794375 149.942250 three or four times a week
sw2940A-ms98-a-0030 149.942250 157.309500 but uh over the years of the pounding and everything else my knees just don't support it any more
sw2940A-ms98-a-0031 157.309500 170.790250 so i've i do walk and i do ride my bike and we do have a workout facility here at work and i do i used to be on a fairly rigorous uh weight lifting program and and uh riding the b[ike]- the stationary bike
sw2940A-ms98-a-0032 170.790250 174.529375 uh but uh then i started i think it was just from
sw2940A-ms98-a-0033 174.529375 176.932625 trying to lift too much
sw2940A-ms98-a-0034 176.932625 182.003250 i started getting the shoulder problems and uh so i've been off now for about four months
sw2940A-ms98-a-0035 182.003250 187.845125 [silence]
sw2940A-ms98-a-0036 187.845125 189.327000 that's right
sw2940A-ms98-a-0037 189.327000 225.735250 [silence]
sw2940A-ms98-a-0038 225.735250 236.373625 the one thing's i mean i enjoy doing it i- i enjoy any kind of a[ny]- any kind of outdoor uh activity exercise whatever and in fact i us[ed]- i do it during lunch i- i really look forward to it
sw2940A-ms98-a-0039 236.373625 246.538750 uh i did overdo it and i know it and i keep trying to tell myself that i'm not twenty years old any more i can't i just can't keep up and uh
sw2940A-ms98-a-0040 246.538750 252.756500 and i've got to learn just you know when i get to a certain point i u[se]- use it to maintain i'm not i'm not after 
sw2940A-ms98-a-0041 252.756500 257.759375 uh you know the uh the twenty year old body any more i'm not uh 
sw2940A-ms98-a-0042 257.759375 259.728625 i'm just not geared that way
sw2940A-ms98-a-0043 259.728625 261.020250 [silence]
sw2940A-ms98-a-0044 261.020250 265.084000 yeah on just staying in condition and uh
sw2940A-ms98-a-0045 265.084000 268.092375 [silence]
sw2940A-ms98-a-0046 268.092375 271.251625 but i had my uh cholesterol was down to
sw2940A-ms98-a-0047 271.251625 273.485875 uh and it was 
sw2940A-ms98-a-0048 273.485875 275.975750 i think around a hundred and twenty two
sw2940A-ms98-a-0049 275.975750 277.744500 [silence]
sw2940A-ms98-a-0050 277.744500 281.670750 yeah very good my my blood pressure was real good
sw2940A-ms98-a-0051 281.670750 287.197875 and uh my uh percent body fat was less than eighteen percent
sw2940A-ms98-a-0052 287.197875 296.093875 so i mean overall i was in very good shape now after four [laughter-months] of being off exercise i've put on probably fifteen pounds
sw2940A-ms98-a-0053 296.093875 303.822250 and taking on you know taking on quite some bad habits of snacking and everything else so i know i mean i've got a major event 
sw2940A-ms98-a-0054 303.822250 309.056500 uh once i get back i think probably within a couple of weeks i'll be able to get back to it again
sw2940A-ms98-a-0055 309.056500 312.119875 [silence]
sw2940A-ms98-a-0056 312.119875 313.699500 [laughter]
sw2940A-ms98-a-0057 313.699500 322.573125 i know it's got to happen uh i'm i'm slowly growing out of my wardrobe so i have no choice i can't afford a new one so [laughter]
sw2940A-ms98-a-0058 322.573125 323.979250 but uh
sw2940A-ms98-a-0059 323.979250 325.222000 but it's
sw2940A-ms98-a-0060 325.222000 326.388250 [silence]
sw2940A-ms98-a-0061 326.388250 333.040375 it's something i've done pretty much all my life i uh i played college ball and and and i've i've always liked 
sw2940A-ms98-a-0062 333.040375 337.017875 staying in shape and it just really bothers me when i'm not
sw2940A-ms98-a-0063 337.017875 338.557875 so uh
sw2940A-ms98-a-0064 338.557875 340.637750 an[d]- an[d]- and plus it's just important
sw2940A-ms98-a-0065 340.637750 348.990125 [silence]
sw2940A-ms98-a-0066 348.990125 353.243750 well i sleep better at night i think clearly you know i'm
sw2940A-ms98-a-0067 353.243750 354.675125 doing something
sw2940A-ms98-a-0068 354.675125 356.250125 uh
sw2940A-ms98-a-0069 356.250125 357.659375 i just
sw2940A-ms98-a-0070 357.659375 361.331500 i have real poor self-esteem if i know that i haven't done something
sw2940A-ms98-a-0071 361.331500 365.114500 i just feel lazy and i feel like i've cheated myself
sw2940A-ms98-a-0072 365.114500 370.208500 an[d]- and i've gone through four months of that and i'm kind of like you know it's time to get back on
sw2940A-ms98-a-0073 370.208500 372.335875 [silence]
sw2940A-ms98-a-0074 372.335875 375.225000 yeah i- i hate it i really do i hate it
sw2940A-ms98-a-0075 375.225000 377.606875 [silence]
sw2940A-ms98-a-0076 377.606875 383.661750 that too and [vocalized-noise] like i said my wife is one of those you know she could sit down and eat a whole chocolate cake
sw2940A-ms98-a-0077 383.661750 387.788500 and and never never show a an ounce of it
sw2940A-ms98-a-0078 387.788500 391.501750 and uh she's got one of those fast metabolisms my daughter does too 
sw2940A-ms98-a-0079 391.501750 393.014000 and i see them eat
sw2940A-ms98-a-0080 393.014000 396.067375 and then i'm of course i'm impelled also
sw2940A-ms98-a-0081 396.067375 397.530125 and uh
sw2940A-ms98-a-0082 397.530125 398.551875 [silence]
sw2940A-ms98-a-0083 398.551875 405.559500 that just that that seems to be the wo[rst]- the worst thing i have a problem with is i tend to like food way too much
sw2940A-ms98-a-0084 405.559500 406.314625 [silence]
sw2940A-ms98-a-0085 406.314625 416.882375 and uh back when back when i was working out when i got home i didn't tend to want to eat this much i was i came home i felt satisfied i'd get out and work a little bit in the yard i'd come in i'm hot
sw2940A-ms98-a-0086 416.882375 422.109375 and i'm a little bit tired and i'd just and i'd just grab a a salad or a snack or something like that and then
sw2940A-ms98-a-0087 422.109375 423.971500 that would be the end of it
sw2940A-ms98-a-0088 423.971500 428.576500 [silence]
sw2940A-ms98-a-0089 428.576500 431.540500 [laughter] it is for me
sw2940A-ms98-a-0090 431.540500 457.072250 [silence]

sw2940A-ms98-a-0095 466.579125 476.002250 i have probably three people in my neighborhood who enjoy running and walking and riding the bikes and stuff like that so i mean there's there's plenty of opportunities
sw2940A-ms98-a-0096 476.002250 478.177000 i just have to do it
sw2940A-ms98-a-0097 478.177000 481.743500 [silence]
sw2940A-ms98-a-0098 481.743500 487.550000 yeah we in fact we've got several of them_1 uh you know within just a couple of miles
sw2940A-ms98-a-0099 487.550000 492.561250 in fact uh you know TI has a real good one right there in in uh Lewisville
