sw2992B-ms98-a-0017 50.623000 59.554625 well we have on Sesame Street and Mister Rogers that kind of stuff and i think those programs are really good for children i know that both of mine have probably learned quite a bit from there
sw2992B-ms98-a-0018 59.554625 65.743000 it's kind of nice to know that they're just going to be seeing you know not a lot of violence and that kind of stuff and they usually
sw2992B-ms98-a-0019 65.743000 70.510750 uh show a lot of things that really teach them different things about the world so
sw2992B-ms98-a-0020 70.510750 77.488000 my so[n]- older son he's going to be five and he's more into watching the cartoons and that kind of stuff now so

sw2992B-ms98-a-0031 132.779000 137.703750 and showing them something like that really doesn't teach them that it is
sw2992B-ms98-a-0032 137.703750 140.776250 [silence]
sw2992B-ms98-a-0033 140.776250 145.939250 no and to get them to feel like that that's just pretend i think is the hardest part you know

sw2992B-ms98-a-0038 157.683250 167.015625 at least before our kids were born we used to always enjoy watching the Cosby Show Thursday nights usually had pretty good with that and as far as um very good comedy
sw2992B-ms98-a-0039 167.015625 171.141375 i like to watch Designing Women if the kids are in bed by then

sw2992B-ms98-a-0045 203.367250 206.729625 [silence]
sw2992B-ms98-a-0046 206.729625 208.988375 well no i imagine
sw2992B-ms98-a-0047 208.988375 217.906125 everything you could think of you know had a hard time and i think maybe with Dallas as far as they lost a lot of characters that had been around at the first
sw2992B-ms98-a-0048 217.906125 224.117875 where i don't know i never watched Knots Landing but i think they've had a lot of their characters stay around

sw2992B-ms98-a-0066 300.257375 305.353875 because i think it's good for them to have physical activity and that kind of stuff too so
sw2992B-ms98-a-0067 305.353875 311.333750 and especially in the summer time we aren't in the house very much in the evenings it's the only cool time to be [laughter-outside]
