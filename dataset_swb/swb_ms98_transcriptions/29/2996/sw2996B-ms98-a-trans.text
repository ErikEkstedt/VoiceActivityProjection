sw2996B-ms98-a-0004 9.596625 20.365375 although at least Texas doesn't have a state income tax yet i mean you know they keep threatening us that maybe there'll be a day that they're going to uh enact this i think uh
sw2996B-ms98-a-0005 20.365375 28.496875 the um other means of providing income for the state have been dwindling so they keep trying to say we may need a uh state income tax
sw2996B-ms98-a-0006 28.496875 45.373625 [silence]
sw2996B-ms98-a-0007 45.373625 47.035750 uh-huh

sw2996B-ms98-a-0009 61.903375 76.694500 yeah makes quite a bit of difference in your uh well your income level you know because_1 other states take ch[unk]- quite a bit a chunk out for uh city and state taxes so you're uh looking at your yearly salary it makes quite a difference
sw2996B-ms98-a-0010 76.694500 79.927000 a little more take home here
sw2996B-ms98-a-0011 79.927000 82.317000 yeah Richardson area

sw2996B-ms98-a-0017 100.726000 110.590000 or up to Collin County somewhere that you're getting out of the um Dallas County area because_1 what do we pay like eight and a half percent something like that for the uh sales tax
sw2996B-ms98-a-0018 110.590000 113.336125 which yeah that really is pretty high
sw2996B-ms98-a-0019 113.336125 117.765375 [silence]
sw2996B-ms98-a-0020 117.765375 129.650750 i think so although i really i don't go up there too much i mean i i normally just kind of go to Richardson Square Mall or Valley View Mall just kind of for the convenience uh
sw2996B-ms98-a-0021 129.650750 142.765875 [noise] i guess maybe if i was going to buy a car or something maybe i would consider where i was buying it to try to you know save a little bit on that sales tax because_1 on a car that really ma[tters]- kind of mounts up
sw2996B-ms98-a-0022 142.765875 150.049000 [silence]
