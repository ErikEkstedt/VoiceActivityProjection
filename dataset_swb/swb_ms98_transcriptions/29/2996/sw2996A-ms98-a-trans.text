sw2996A-ms98-a-0086 394.402875 406.791750 uh because_1 i remember we went to to Oklahoma to th[is]- this bingo place this Choctaw bingo uh a couple weeks ago and somebody that went with me bought a carton
sw2996A-ms98-a-0087 406.791750 412.647125 for uh uh ten dollars and something and they really thought they were getting a big discount
sw2996A-ms98-a-0088 412.647125 417.724125 well because it's you know the Indians i don't think they pay tax

sw2996A-ms98-a-0092 436.103750 449.747000 the stakes are higher and payoffs are bigger and so forth [noise] i won a [laughter-dollar] [laughter] yeah i had fun uh couple people on the bus won some money o[ne]- one guy won
