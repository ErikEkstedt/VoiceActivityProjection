sw2944A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.305125 [noise]
sw2944A-ms98-a-0002 0.305125 8.917500 uh well i mean i've had time to think about it because uh we've had uh i- i- there's been a great deal of difficulty in finding someone to talk to so
sw2944A-ms98-a-0003 8.917500 19.006875 so um i i was thinking about a couple things uh and whether they are serious some things are serious and some aren't i guess the biggest thing that bothers me is
sw2944A-ms98-a-0004 19.006875 24.417500 is uh not the biggest thing but one of the things that bothers me is the credit information
sw2944A-ms98-a-0005 24.417500 34.070375 uh situation that you uh that you find yourself almost compromised into giving if you want any s[ort]- sort of credit e[xtensive]- extensive checks and
sw2944A-ms98-a-0006 34.070375 45.618000 and things of that nature when um i i i mean i i don't know if that's an invasion of privacy simply i i do to i do feel it is but i don't know whether some of the questions they ask are legitimate
sw2944A-ms98-a-0007 45.618000 48.946875 uh because they are the ones who are making the profit out of your [laughter]
sw2944A-ms98-a-0008 48.946875 56.069500 [silence]
sw2944A-ms98-a-0009 56.069500 57.433375 uh-huh

sw2944A-ms98-a-0011 87.424750 96.610625 well i guess i guess then it's just the big brother concept of the fact that once you give your social security number there are people i guess who are who are
sw2944A-ms98-a-0012 96.610625 108.734000 uh actually collecting all this all the time and and profiles are given i understand uh i read the other day that uh these telemarketeers when someone talks to you on the phone
sw2944A-ms98-a-0013 108.734000 120.375250 uh all all they need now is your telephone number which i guess is involved in this controversy of whether they can reveal your telephone number or not i i i feel that is an invasion of privacy but it
sw2944A-ms98-a-0014 120.375250 126.260125 [silence]
sw2944A-ms98-a-0015 126.260125 127.579750 yeah

sw2944A-ms98-a-0025 172.512250 178.708000 yeah i i have a particular subject that not everyone agrees with me uh
sw2944A-ms98-a-0026 178.708000 190.305000 uh well by by uh i make my living by uh flying airplanes for for a company and uh as a as a uh an airline pilot i have to take random drug testing
sw2944A-ms98-a-0027 190.305000 200.076000 i mean it seems to me the public outcry was for that at the time so i when i finish a a certain flight on a random basis i have to
sw2944A-ms98-a-0028 200.076000 205.671625 uh have a wri[tten]- a drug test and and and that's without i uh probably cause
sw2944A-ms98-a-0029 205.671625 216.465000 and uh a and in the end now i mean they've tested they've spent forty million dollars and they've found uh i think uh in pilots anyway of something like uh
sw2944A-ms98-a-0030 216.465000 224.991375 uh eighty six thousand tests there's only been two guys have come up uh three guys have come up positive and one of them was a bad test so

sw2944A-ms98-a-0046 289.904625 303.269375 yeah i i can understand the public's alarm to it but i guess having done this all my life i knew that there wasn't a problem and and it indeed it has proved out that way but now try to get the damn thing repealed you know
sw2944A-ms98-a-0047 303.269375 317.191875 i guess i feel bad because uh not only that but in some of the instances like you just cited where you have to give your fingerprints i mean what what what happens if you say no If you say no then you're excluded and i doesn't seem the courts
sw2944A-ms98-a-0048 317.191875 318.778750 yeah
sw2944A-ms98-a-0049 318.778750 322.836375 [silence]
sw2944A-ms98-a-0050 322.836375 324.375125 that's right
sw2944A-ms98-a-0051 324.375125 325.562750 [silence]
sw2944A-ms98-a-0052 325.562750 333.306625 it's my feeling also that that that although i i don't know if it's that serious i- but that was part of the question
sw2944A-ms98-a-0053 333.306625 341.300125 i do feel the courts have have held up a great deal of of our privacy i mean particularly look in in some of the in some of the
sw2944A-ms98-a-0054 341.300125 352.689375 uh i notice in some of the sexual cases they've held up a great deal of privacy which i support of course but it i guess with our fear with crime and maybe airline crashes and things like that it does seem that we've
sw2944A-ms98-a-0055 352.689375 362.656500 we've slipped and that's eroded or at least those in the market place their everyday life seemed to take that as a signal that you know it's fair game to you you have to answer these questions of course
sw2944A-ms98-a-0056 362.656500 369.965125 uh i don't know i i feel there has been an erosion and i don't really know how serious it is except i don't like it [laughter]

sw2944A-ms98-a-0071 423.975250 431.478625 well i mean it it just take that that step now where where now we feel there's a need to do that and the next thing you know then
sw2944A-ms98-a-0072 431.478625 437.501500 uh there's always the need to to go and inspect lockers of high school students that
sw2944A-ms98-a-0073 437.501500 440.628375 [silence]
sw2944A-ms98-a-0074 440.628375 448.696000 [vocalized-noise] yeah i guess so i mean well uh uh good luck to you you just moved to Texas [laughter] from Minneapolis 
sw2944A-ms98-a-0075 448.696000 463.483125 i i don't i don't hold out much hope for you i think they'll be a cultural shock i mean i was based there a lot uh several times in the service and i was absolutely flabbergasted at the in in at least in criminal law some of the some of the latitudes that the police had but 
sw2944A-ms98-a-0076 463.483125 467.854125 [silence]

sw2944A-ms98-a-0089 519.778500 525.736375 well i mean i don't understand if you if you don't if they don't make a criminal check why do you have to be fingerprinted
sw2944A-ms98-a-0090 525.736375 528.969875 [silence]
sw2944A-ms98-a-0091 528.969875 532.469500 oh i see oh the state doesn't require it

sw2944A-ms98-a-0093 533.475250 537.107375 well that's kind of that's rather that's rather unusual isn't it
sw2944A-ms98-a-0094 537.107375 550.431750 [silence]
sw2944A-ms98-a-0095 550.431750 562.882000 well i guess i guess the extension of that is why why not [vocalized-noise] the next thing you know we'll just stop a random amount of motorists and then if we really think that drugs are a problem we can randomly stop anybody on the street 
sw2944A-ms98-a-0096 562.882000 564.606500 oh they do
sw2944A-ms98-a-0097 564.606500 568.259750 [silence]
sw2944A-ms98-a-0098 568.259750 575.100000 yeah well there's there's all sorts of scare tactics i guess to to invade our privacy and
