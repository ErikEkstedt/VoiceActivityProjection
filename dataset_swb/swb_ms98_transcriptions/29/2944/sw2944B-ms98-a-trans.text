sw2944B-ms98-a-0019 48.006125 56.861375 well what's scary is uh about two three four months ago on a Sun[day]- in the Sunday edition of what is called the morning paper here The Dallas Morning News
sw2944B-ms98-a-0020 56.861375 65.141750 they showed a reporter and a um and a copy editor how they went out and they just took um a fellow in John Q Public in Dallas
sw2944B-ms98-a-0021 65.141750 73.460750 and all they had was let's see they had his birth[day]- they had something like his birth date the street address um they weren't even sure of the correct spelling of his last name
sw2944B-ms98-a-0022 73.460750 85.535625 [noise] excuse me and it was um very scary to see what they found out i mean they were able to find out what liens he still had against you know two or three houses through a two divorces children's names locations
sw2944B-ms98-a-0023 85.535625 87.950125 um it was really frightening

sw2944B-ms98-a-0032 118.640375 127.950750 i do too yeah i don't the other thing i don't like is um in terms of uh like we just moved here from uh Minneapolis and uh
sw2944B-ms98-a-0033 127.950750 139.439000 to get the the very nice townhouse that we're in you were required by the property management firm that was representing a private landlo[rd]- you know husband and wife owners um who had never done this before
sw2944B-ms98-a-0034 139.439000 144.095000 they um asked us for again an astounding amount of information and
sw2944B-ms98-a-0035 144.095000 151.475625 what we really didn't have the same opportunity you know and i guess that's when i also get upset that if you're going to do it then i want to do it too
sw2944B-ms98-a-0036 151.475625 164.569125 um in terms of the credit yeah i know um we're also going through adoption now in for an adoption and i mean after we gave our fingerprints [vocalized-noise] to the FBI you you look at each other yeah you look at each other and you say 
sw2944B-ms98-a-0037 164.569125 174.334125 well [laughter] too late now um so i mean it's it's a matter of anybody can get it any way and how if they really try um

sw2944B-ms98-a-0053 221.005750 224.110250 positive for anything see yeah
sw2944B-ms98-a-0054 224.110250 237.245625 see uh and i just started working well for an electronics firm down here i used to be a reporter and then now i'm in corporate communications and uh part of that [noise] excuse me was as a new hire that i had to take a drug test and i had never been asked that and i thought
sw2944B-ms98-a-0055 237.245625 248.599875 um i really didn't like it um i- i have very mixed feelings about i don't disagree or agree with you um i think i- i think that it's well and you're in that field so i don't know but it's
sw2944B-ms98-a-0056 248.599875 256.851875 you know we lived in uh Minneapolis when the Northwest Airlines pilot in the Dakotas yeah that hit the fan like uh you uh you're obviously aware of that um
sw2944B-ms98-a-0057 256.851875 257.132750 [noise]
sw2944B-ms98-a-0058 257.132750 266.228000 i don't know there should be some happy medium in terms of if they're going to do random um i i don't agree with random i guess i would look for a standard in consistency
sw2944B-ms98-a-0059 266.228000 276.599625 you know in terms of maybe at set intervals so that everybody knows what's going on um i don't see a problem with that i do think i see some level of necessity um
sw2944B-ms98-a-0060 276.599625 282.262625 [noise] in something where people are transporting other people uh only because of the things you've heard about
sw2944B-ms98-a-0061 282.262625 292.120000 The problem is the reason i feel that way even to a low degree is because it's the old story the minority make it bad for the you know majority um
sw2944B-ms98-a-0062 292.120000 295.337750 yeah i'm not alarmed
sw2944B-ms98-a-0063 295.337750 297.290250 [silence]
sw2944B-ms98-a-0064 297.290250 298.661375 yeah

sw2944B-ms98-a-0068 314.264000 326.604875 right right it's a matter and that's um exactly what it is i mean that that kind of screening in general is a matter of exclusion um if we didn't give it we wouldn't go to Romania i mean if you hate to say that but that's the way it is
sw2944B-ms98-a-0069 326.604875 332.679250 [silence]
sw2944B-ms98-a-0070 332.679250 334.152875 uh-huh

sw2944B-ms98-a-0078 368.990125 378.331375 in terms of the privacy yeah that in it and also i agree with that and in the in terms of the question um in terms uh i worked in medical public relations for almost a decade
sw2944B-ms98-a-0079 378.331375 388.478375 and that was pre AIDS and all the other um things that were probably there but just not [noise] excuse me labeled and i have a real problem with medical professionals um
sw2944B-ms98-a-0080 388.478375 402.120500 it goes back to the things like drug screening but if it's in any level even with the potential to endangerment um and i think this is much stronger than you know pilots or uh train engineers being screened um the transmission of the AIDS virus
sw2944B-ms98-a-0081 402.120500 411.273750 um it it that's a real ethical problem i mean i don't i don't have the answer i i you know i mean i think of the young girl in Florida who well yeah that's was she from your part of the country
sw2944B-ms98-a-0082 411.273750 425.090000 or was she from the young girl that uh contracted AIDS through her dentist allegedly and then they proved it yeah i don't i don't know um [vocalized-noise] i don't know if it's the old story that we are killing ourselves in general or what um
sw2944B-ms98-a-0083 425.090000 430.992625 [silence]

sw2944B-ms98-a-0086 435.993750 443.358000 oh yeah the i guess the question is uh the the thing for me is who sets the parameters or who has the control you know
sw2944B-ms98-a-0087 443.358000 445.746000 [silence]
sw2944B-ms98-a-0088 445.746000 448.382875 yeah [laughter]

sw2944B-ms98-a-0091 460.586000 462.583500 oh it's it's terr[ible]-
sw2944B-ms98-a-0092 462.583500 471.798750 i'm uh very seriously not more than just seriously i'm more than likely going to be going to law school in the fall and yeah if i figure out that's still what i really want to do and
sw2944B-ms98-a-0093 471.798750 477.448500 th[e]- the things i'm finding out are the [noise] in terms of things like privacy the way the law is interpreted presented
sw2944B-ms98-a-0094 477.448500 489.894250 um it's no better than [laughter-journalism] um except in journalism it's words um this is very frightening in that uh oh and in uh in Texas they they d[o]- they do not require for instance for prospective adoptive parents
sw2944B-ms98-a-0095 489.894250 496.351250 whether it's domestic or international they're one of only five states that do not require a criminal investigation check
sw2944B-ms98-a-0096 496.351250 510.676875 yet if you're caught with let's just say um that somebody who's in n[eed]- not us but somebody who's need of carting um aluminum beer cans around they haven't touched them they haven't drank them they picked them up off the street and they want to take them to a recycling uh resource
sw2944B-ms98-a-0097 510.676875 520.441000 for money or whatever um they've they've been going through a lot of bad publicity here in the last three or four months again um because they've been arresting people like that
sw2944B-ms98-a-0098 520.441000 522.141375 you know
sw2944B-ms98-a-0099 522.141375 525.264375 [silence]
sw2944B-ms98-a-0100 525.264375 534.944250 because um in our case one is at the state and the other one is at the federal level because you have to dea[l]- because you have to deal with the IN yeah because you have to deal with the uh imm[igration]- immigration service
sw2944B-ms98-a-0101 534.944250 536.116750 [silence]
sw2944B-ms98-a-0102 536.116750 544.945625 yeah it is it's uh the whole thing is i mean there's again there's no consistency you know like in your in terms of you being a pilot and being tested randomly um
sw2944B-ms98-a-0103 544.945625 552.045500 i can't see why after a certain number of years or after a certain time frame they can't do it at an interval or you know i mean there just this 
sw2944B-ms98-a-0104 552.045500 561.373750 [silence]
sw2944B-ms98-a-0105 561.373750 563.604375 they they do that in Texas
sw2944B-ms98-a-0106 563.604375 570.667250 [laughter] [laughter-they] don't do it for drugs what they do is they check to see if you've got uh current insurance or they check to to see if you're permits are
sw2944B-ms98-a-0107 570.667250 572.295500 [silence]
sw2944B-ms98-a-0108 572.295500 573.846625 yeah
sw2944B-ms98-a-0109 573.846625 584.514500 i know and it's kind of um what's the word i want i don't it's ju[st]- to me it's just frightening you know i mean the old uh i'm old enough now where George Orwell uh way past the time
sw2944B-ms98-a-0110 584.514500 585.217500 [laughter]
sw2944B-ms98-a-0111 585.217500 586.559375 yeah

sw2944B-ms98-a-0113 587.738125 591.084000 yeah it's exactly true i mean i
sw2944B-ms98-a-0114 591.084000 598.726750 well look at what we're talking now i mean it's look how we're talking now i mean you wonder ultimately what a network of stranger you [laughter-know]
