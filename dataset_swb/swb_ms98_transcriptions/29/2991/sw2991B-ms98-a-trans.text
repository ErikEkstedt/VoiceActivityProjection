sw2991B-ms98-a-0002 0.734000 6.823625 [silence]
sw2991B-ms98-a-0003 6.823625 11.262250 no i don't not at home i work with them quite a bit though
sw2991B-ms98-a-0004 11.262250 17.715125 [silence]
sw2991B-ms98-a-0005 17.715125 19.427250 oh okay
sw2991B-ms98-a-0006 19.427250 23.011250 [silence]
sw2991B-ms98-a-0007 23.011250 26.283625 the well i think they're useful i think they're
sw2991B-ms98-a-0008 26.283625 30.893375 in some in some instances they're they're over used
sw2991B-ms98-a-0009 30.893375 34.339250 well that's not the right way to say it um
sw2991B-ms98-a-0010 34.339250 38.040000 [silence]
sw2991B-ms98-a-0011 38.040000 47.089500 well i think that uh some some work places where i've been they they set up like everybody has their own PC
sw2991B-ms98-a-0012 47.089500 58.534250 which a lot of times everybody doesn't need a PC and it really without them knowing how to use it properly it slows them down more than it helps them accomplish something
sw2991B-ms98-a-0013 58.534250 67.245625 they spend more time messing with the PC than they would actually accomplishing the task that they're trying to do if they didn't have a PC at all
sw2991B-ms98-a-0014 67.245625 73.944500 [silence]
sw2991B-ms98-a-0015 73.944500 76.170125 uh-huh that's true
sw2991B-ms98-a-0016 76.170125 81.766875 and you have to you know be familiar with the like there're so many different software packages
sw2991B-ms98-a-0017 81.766875 85.811375 i[t]- you have to be familiar with the one that you're going to be using most
sw2991B-ms98-a-0018 85.811375 86.821875 [silence]
sw2991B-ms98-a-0019 86.821875 89.119750 a lot of times uh
sw2991B-ms98-a-0020 89.119750 90.930250 people
sw2991B-ms98-a-0021 90.930250 103.886125 know about half of the capabilities of a package that they should know to actually be able to use it properly and so they waste more time with their trying to uh
sw2991B-ms98-a-0022 103.886125 109.006875 to figure out how to do you know other things
sw2991B-ms98-a-0023 109.006875 111.453125 than they would
sw2991B-ms98-a-0024 111.453125 121.323000 if they if they actually understood what they were trying to do you know like uh they want to to format a report a certain way
sw2991B-ms98-a-0025 121.323000 131.978000 and if they really understood the capabilities of the package they could they could do that in uh about you know half the time that they spend
sw2991B-ms98-a-0026 131.978000 136.897750 trying to figure out how to do it without spending the time to learn the package properly
sw2991B-ms98-a-0027 136.897750 138.318875 [silence]
sw2991B-ms98-a-0028 138.318875 140.901375 right exactly
sw2991B-ms98-a-0029 140.901375 142.586250 uh-huh
sw2991B-ms98-a-0030 142.586250 154.407500 a lot of times they they they do it manually on the computer which just really is a waste of time and then if they ever have to change anything in that in that in the document
sw2991B-ms98-a-0031 154.407500 165.808000 they have to go back and redo it all manually whereas if they had learned the package properly to start with and had set it up correctly the package would do that for them
sw2991B-ms98-a-0032 165.808000 170.321000 whenever they wanted to make a change so i i've seen that as a problem
sw2991B-ms98-a-0033 170.321000 175.013875 [silence]
sw2991B-ms98-a-0034 175.013875 184.451000 right but in some in some cases the with the formatting what i'm talking about is that they would set up they set up a certain um
sw2991B-ms98-a-0035 184.451000 185.789000 [silence]
sw2991B-ms98-a-0036 185.789000 189.024750 document and it may be eight pages long
sw2991B-ms98-a-0037 189.024750 195.771750 and they set it up manually so that they have all their spacings and formattings and tabs set manually
sw2991B-ms98-a-0038 195.771750 197.791125 [silence]
sw2991B-ms98-a-0039 197.791125 208.822000 and um then when they have to make a change say they want to insert a paragraph they've got to go through the document and reset all the page breaks manually
sw2991B-ms98-a-0040 208.822000 216.746375 and rewrite the whole thing instead of having the if if they had set up the formatting on the system itself it would do that for them
sw2991B-ms98-a-0041 216.746375 221.759750 and save them a lot of time but a lot of people don't spend the time to learn the package
sw2991B-ms98-a-0042 221.759750 228.697750 [silence]
sw2991B-ms98-a-0043 228.697750 235.112750 oh no no you can left and right justify the whole thing it comes out just perfectly spaced like a block
sw2991B-ms98-a-0044 235.112750 240.766250 it'll it'll automatically it's like typesetting it'll automatically do that for you
sw2991B-ms98-a-0045 240.766250 242.570250 [silence]
sw2991B-ms98-a-0046 242.570250 250.747875 usually it doesn't divide words they usually have it i[t]- have it space the words in a line rather than divide a word
sw2991B-ms98-a-0047 250.747875 251.803500 [silence]
sw2991B-ms98-a-0048 251.803500 254.652875 that you see like in a newspaper 
sw2991B-ms98-a-0049 254.652875 268.373000 they typeset they don't usually break words in a newspaper if the if one line is going to be a lot shorter than another line they just they just add spaces to that line to make it look long as the rest of the lines
sw2991B-ms98-a-0050 268.373000 271.893250 [silence]
sw2991B-ms98-a-0051 271.893250 277.804375 right and most computers do that most pa[ckages]- most software packages will do that for you
sw2991B-ms98-a-0052 277.804375 280.278875 [silence]
sw2991B-ms98-a-0053 280.278875 293.944000 and i've known people that have used a package for for five years you know and i would say well have y[ou]- you know you know more about this package than i do how do you left justify and they would say i don't know
sw2991B-ms98-a-0054 293.944000 300.892875 and it would take me maybe two or three minutes looking in the manual to figure out what command it was to caused this to happen
sw2991B-ms98-a-0055 300.892875 309.941750 and they would say how did you do that and i'm like well it's really easy and they were like well i never knew that and that obviously they'd never considered looking it up you know
sw2991B-ms98-a-0056 309.941750 314.229000 [silence]
sw2991B-ms98-a-0057 314.229000 322.441875 sometimes it's sometimes well it's it's a number of different things sometimes they don't uh
sw2991B-ms98-a-0058 322.441875 328.605000 they don't think that they can get any information out of the manual some manuals aren't really designed very well
sw2991B-ms98-a-0059 328.605000 338.685000 but some of them are and more and more of them are coming out written in a way that it that just a a basic general user can understand them so i think um
sw2991B-ms98-a-0060 338.685000 352.122750 people think it's going to take them a lot longer to learn it properly than it really would and so they're really wasting time rather than saving themselves time because they think well it's quicker just to do it myself when it's really not
sw2991B-ms98-a-0061 352.122750 354.087125 [silence]
sw2991B-ms98-a-0062 354.087125 356.005750 well i think so
sw2991B-ms98-a-0063 356.005750 357.832500 [silence]
sw2991B-ms98-a-0064 357.832500 360.237000 um-hum exactly
sw2991B-ms98-a-0065 360.237000 368.119750 [silence]
sw2991B-ms98-a-0066 368.119750 369.494500 uh-huh
sw2991B-ms98-a-0067 369.494500 376.878750 [silence]
sw2991B-ms98-a-0068 376.878750 382.647500 uh the the with PC's they're either IBM or IBM compatible mostly
sw2991B-ms98-a-0069 382.647500 383.648125 [silence]
sw2991B-ms98-a-0070 383.648125 386.687875 that is you know the industry standard
sw2991B-ms98-a-0071 386.687875 388.538875 [silence]
sw2991B-ms98-a-0072 388.538875 389.852500 uh-huh
sw2991B-ms98-a-0073 389.852500 391.499000 [silence]
sw2991B-ms98-a-0074 391.499000 395.110000 there's a lot of of really good IBM compatibles
sw2991B-ms98-a-0075 395.110000 396.851750 [silence]
sw2991B-ms98-a-0076 396.851750 402.435500 too they don't have to necessarily be the IBM brand but they have to adhere to that industry standard
sw2991B-ms98-a-0077 402.435500 408.378625 [silence]
sw2991B-ms98-a-0078 408.378625 411.070500 oh probably
sw2991B-ms98-a-0079 411.070500 414.835375 [laughter] okay bye-bye
