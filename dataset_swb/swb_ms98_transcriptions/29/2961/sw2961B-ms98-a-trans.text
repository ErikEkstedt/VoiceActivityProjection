sw2961B-ms98-a-0003 3.468750 12.929125 yeah i was just wondering how did this get on my list [laughter] how how did this subject get on my list oh well i'm not sure um
sw2961B-ms98-a-0004 12.929125 22.656875 well uh my children are grown now but i used care child care services uh for a number of years and i
sw2961B-ms98-a-0005 22.656875 36.240375 i don't know if i had it to do it over again maybe i would be a little more selective and really you know find out more about them_1 i think the main thing was that i needed someone to take care of my children and i and i generally used some place that was either
sw2961B-ms98-a-0006 36.240375 50.639750 you know uh close to where i lived or close to where i worked and i really never had a[ny]- had any real problems and i always felt like that they did a good job and um but i don't have small children now so
sw2961B-ms98-a-0007 50.639750 61.545125 uh i don't know if it would be different now you know i hear i hear i know a lot of uh mothers or uh people that i work with and they are you know putting their children in different places
sw2961B-ms98-a-0008 61.545125 63.088250 um
sw2961B-ms98-a-0009 63.088250 64.540375 [silence]

sw2961B-ms98-a-0012 67.384500 68.207375 so you
sw2961B-ms98-a-0013 68.207375 70.188250 [silence]
sw2961B-ms98-a-0014 70.188250 76.354750 yeah uh i suppose uh d[epends]- it depends on what kind of program they have especially for summer summer programs
sw2961B-ms98-a-0015 76.354750 77.791125 um
sw2961B-ms98-a-0016 77.791125 88.307125 whether or not you know a lot of it is uh when they're in school and you know their after school thing you'd hope that they would have time for studying but most of the time they don't they just play
sw2961B-ms98-a-0017 88.307125 97.185750 but uh i think Summer time i'll i i know i was talking to one lady she's just changing her daughter to a different uh
sw2961B-ms98-a-0018 97.185750 109.334000 child care center for the Summer because they have so much more structured time and they offer different classes like her daughter's going to be taking gymnastics and she said if she had left her where that she was
sw2961B-ms98-a-0019 109.334000 116.711375 uh previously that a lot of time would you know just be free time for them to do whatever they wanted do and a lot of times they get bored so
sw2961B-ms98-a-0020 116.711375 125.988125 [silence]

sw2961B-ms98-a-0023 131.912875 145.834875 and i guess the ratio of of workers to children you know would be something to consider uh especially if they're little bitty children that would be a i wou[ld]- i i would hate to leave an uh a real small baby you know
sw2961B-ms98-a-0024 145.834875 148.912500 uh before say before
sw2961B-ms98-a-0025 148.912500 155.970125 three or four years old anything anyone young[er]- younger than that i'd just kind of feel kind of uncomfortable about leaving the child but
sw2961B-ms98-a-0026 155.970125 156.991875 [silence]
sw2961B-ms98-a-0027 156.991875 163.818375 yeah but i did it so i mean but but i look back on some of the things that i did with my kids and i shudder
sw2961B-ms98-a-0028 163.818375 178.307375 [silence]
sw2961B-ms98-a-0029 178.307375 178.876750 um-hum
sw2961B-ms98-a-0030 178.876750 181.005625 [silence]
sw2961B-ms98-a-0031 181.005625 182.865375 that's true that's true
sw2961B-ms98-a-0032 182.865375 189.198500 [silence]
sw2961B-ms98-a-0033 189.198500 202.097500 so basically i think that that when they do that that person really feels a need to get out of the house and you know even if their the money is going mostly to child care they're not really having much to take home
sw2961B-ms98-a-0034 202.097500 216.296250 it's something a fill[ing]- fulfilling a[nother]- another need i suppose than staying home with with children all the time but that's a tough deal to do too too you know but uh it'd be nice to
sw2961B-ms98-a-0035 216.296250 219.344750 to work you know
sw2961B-ms98-a-0036 219.344750 233.208875 i don't know i don't know a good solution to that but but it's it's tough to be i s[tarted]- i started to say stuck at home with children all the time and never getting [laughter-out] that that's just probably not a real good way to put it
sw2961B-ms98-a-0037 233.208875 241.234250 but some people you know they their their life and children can be a full time job and you don't have time for anything else so you
sw2961B-ms98-a-0038 241.234250 249.932375 so i would say maybe you know a day or two a week to get out to go do something else not necessarily go back to work or something but
sw2961B-ms98-a-0039 249.932375 251.245250 i don't know

sw2961B-ms98-a-0054 316.969750 322.445500 yeah maybe it's something before you start having children you know maybe there's a lot of stu[ff]- but but i[f]- if
sw2961B-ms98-a-0055 322.445500 328.039875 you'll never have them_1 if you start [laughter] [laughter-doing] [laughter-all] [laughter-that] get too logical about it
sw2961B-ms98-a-0056 328.039875 331.526500 but it's great it's great having kids and then

sw2961B-ms98-a-0058 332.545000 335.733375 uh yeah i think everybody ought to ought to try it

sw2961B-ms98-a-0060 341.274875 347.270500 yeah yeah she'll prob[ably]- she'll probably spend a lot more time finding the right place uh
sw2961B-ms98-a-0061 347.270500 352.564000 i don't know i i tend to think if they're licensed then they're you know
sw2961B-ms98-a-0062 352.564000 365.851875 i don't know i you know y[ou]- you can f[eel]- you can get a feel from it too if your child is too small you can't but if y[ou]- if they're old enough to to know you know they'll they'll let you know if they're unhappy or i[f]- or if someone isn't treating them well or
sw2961B-ms98-a-0063 365.851875 372.205375 [silence]
sw2961B-ms98-a-0064 372.205375 378.060125 i'll tell you one thing is that my of course i'm i'm a single parent and so i guess and um
sw2961B-ms98-a-0065 378.060125 381.743500 my my son was five and my daughter was two
sw2961B-ms98-a-0066 381.743500 384.235375 and i had uh they had to go in child care
sw2961B-ms98-a-0067 384.235375 388.734000 but uh but i think they were more uh well i uh
sw2961B-ms98-a-0068 388.734000 393.753500 my sister who had two boys and she did not work and sh[e]-
sw2961B-ms98-a-0069 393.753500 402.809250 and she had a real difficult time when the when time for them to go to school they did not uh want to leave her and my children who were so used to being out and
sw2961B-ms98-a-0070 402.809250 412.762250 uh learning how to get along with other children and taking directions and stuff like that they just went very smoothly off into school you know without a problem so
sw2961B-ms98-a-0071 412.762250 421.817375 i think even if you don't leave them_1 full time but have them_1 you know preschool or mother's day out or couple things a couple of days a week or something like that i think it's always good
