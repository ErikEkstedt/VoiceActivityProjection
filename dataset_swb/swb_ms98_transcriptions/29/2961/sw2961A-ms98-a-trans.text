sw2961A-ms98-a-0006 9.025625 11.649875 i i don't know i've got mine
sw2961A-ms98-a-0007 11.649875 60.825000 [silence]
sw2961A-ms98-a-0008 60.825000 70.999250 well yeah i i don't have kids yet um i won't for a couple uh for at least two or three years and my wife is planning on probably taking care of them at that point um
sw2961A-ms98-a-0009 70.999250 88.072375 [silence]
sw2961A-ms98-a-0010 88.072375 89.813875 yeah
sw2961A-ms98-a-0011 89.813875 116.243625 [silence]
sw2961A-ms98-a-0012 116.243625 122.067625 that's actually yeah what i've been i'm thinking of the child care center because_1 they have like licensing procedures and
sw2961A-ms98-a-0013 122.067625 131.722125 and stuff like that that seems to me you know good and i mean it is a state license to seemingly more often than not that means that they're good and they have lots of activities and people who know how to take care of the kids
sw2961A-ms98-a-0014 131.722125 133.009500 and some
sw2961A-ms98-a-0015 133.009500 136.771625 [silence]
sw2961A-ms98-a-0016 136.771625 140.166625 um-hum [noise]
sw2961A-ms98-a-0017 140.166625 155.517125 [silence]
sw2961A-ms98-a-0018 155.517125 157.986375 with somebody else yeah oh i agree
sw2961A-ms98-a-0019 157.986375 159.102375 [silence]
sw2961A-ms98-a-0020 159.102375 160.144875 and
sw2961A-ms98-a-0021 160.144875 163.473750 [silence]
sw2961A-ms98-a-0022 163.473750 169.583500 i wonder actually i wonder about costs because_1 most people i know who who have kids you know uh
sw2961A-ms98-a-0023 169.583500 178.572750 one parent doesn't work a part of the time you know only works part time and takes care of the kid part time and then it turns out that that person's salary just winds up going to paying
sw2961A-ms98-a-0024 178.572750 181.299375 the people who who who take care of the kids
sw2961A-ms98-a-0025 181.299375 182.347375 [silence]
sw2961A-ms98-a-0026 182.347375 189.467500 you know that whi[ch]- which amazes me um i i you know it never occurred to me how expensive that sort of thing can be
sw2961A-ms98-a-0027 189.467500 201.544875 [silence]
sw2961A-ms98-a-0028 201.544875 203.109500 yeah
sw2961A-ms98-a-0029 203.109500 227.317875 [silence]
sw2961A-ms98-a-0030 227.317875 228.743125 [noise]
sw2961A-ms98-a-0031 228.743125 229.998000 [silence]
sw2961A-ms98-a-0032 229.998000 230.993875 [laughter]
sw2961A-ms98-a-0033 230.993875 232.765500 [silence]
sw2961A-ms98-a-0034 232.765500 234.535250 yeah that
sw2961A-ms98-a-0035 234.535250 250.764625 [silence]
sw2961A-ms98-a-0036 250.764625 261.354625 yeah i don't i don't you know i just yeah it it just strange because people do i mean in that sense it probably is pretty good to go out and just who cares if it if if all your salary goes to pay somebody
sw2961A-ms98-a-0037 261.354625 273.950375 you sort of get away for a while too we have i don't i don't um it's strange it's funny that i should get this particular we should be on this topic now because uh because we have even though we have no kids we have people staying with us
sw2961A-ms98-a-0038 273.950375 282.870000 um for the for the for the for the the weekend and they have a six a six year old son and a three month old son
sw2961A-ms98-a-0039 282.870000 290.911000 so i'm just sort of seeing what all the hassles are you know of you know like last night we we we the six year old decided he wanted to go camping in the back yard
sw2961A-ms98-a-0040 290.911000 294.727875 so we pitched a tent in the dark yard actually and his father and
sw2961A-ms98-a-0041 294.727875 299.420625 and the little boy and i all went out and had you know a a b[oy's]- a boys' night out
sw2961A-ms98-a-0042 299.420625 306.727750 in the back yard and about quarter of one he woke up half crying and he couldn't sleep and this and that i mean w[e]- we wanted to bring him inside [laughter]
sw2961A-ms98-a-0043 306.727750 313.908875 so when about a one o'clock in the morning we all got up and sort of wandered inside so i'm think all the benefits of taking care of kids or all the fun part of taking care of kids i guess
sw2961A-ms98-a-0044 313.908875 334.718875 [silence]
sw2961A-ms98-a-0045 334.718875 341.356375 [laughter] yeah we plan on a couple of years and i just like it's just like child care will become very important to my life then 
sw2961A-ms98-a-0046 341.356375 342.753250 you know
sw2961A-ms98-a-0047 342.753250 364.986000 [silence]
sw2961A-ms98-a-0048 364.986000 372.699500 yeah that that that that's probably true although i i don't like you say i don't know if i'd put a kid there who's less than you know uh four years old or something
sw2961A-ms98-a-0049 372.699500 420.710750 [silence]
sw2961A-ms98-a-0050 420.710750 426.154875 yeah probably just to make friends and and stuff like that
sw2961A-ms98-a-0051 426.154875 431.190000 yeah i if it's just like i say this is a very foreign topic for me [laughter-so]
sw2961A-ms98-a-0052 431.190000 435.606375 one of those things i have to learn about i do i work with kids a lot
sw2961A-ms98-a-0053 435.606375 438.546875 i i i do work with kids a lot i uh i
sw2961A-ms98-a-0054 438.546875 443.911125 i do uh um i teach a karate class twice a week with with with kids
sw2961A-ms98-a-0055 443.911125 445.030625 [silence]
sw2961A-ms98-a-0056 445.030625 454.301625 um they're four to seven actually there's one at i work mostly with four to seven and then eight to twelve i i'm i'm the class [vocalized-noise] so i i help out in this class and uh
sw2961A-ms98-a-0057 454.301625 459.998625 and it's really um weird because_1 i'm not you know the first when i first started doing it i i can
sw2961A-ms98-a-0058 459.998625 465.695625 put it this way it it it's helped me gain lots of respect for people who can work with lots large numbers of kids [laughter]
sw2961A-ms98-a-0059 465.695625 470.929250 because when i first started li[ke]- i had no idea how to how to handle a f[ive]- five year old kid
sw2961A-ms98-a-0060 470.929250 475.520625 wi[th]- especially when there are ten of them floating around and you're supposed to be running around teaching them things and
sw2961A-ms98-a-0061 475.520625 476.569625 of course
sw2961A-ms98-a-0062 476.569625 480.673000 [silence]
sw2961A-ms98-a-0063 480.673000 491.562125 uh i i do but i'm finding there's there's uh another person there who has goo[d]- he has got absolutely no training from what i know but he's just wonderful with kids and he seems to know how to hold their attention you know he keeps them
sw2961A-ms98-a-0064 491.562125 505.050000 he does lots of you know he's he's he's fast moving with them they'll do this exercise they'll do that they'll do this they'll do that he keeps them moving quick enough that you know when they stop losing attention they start you know they're the all of a sudden they're switched
sw2961A-ms98-a-0065 505.050000 508.468625 and you know there're a couple in there who actually have um
sw2961A-ms98-a-0066 508.468625 520.418625 who i think have attention deficit disorders or they have very very low attention and those are harder to work with but i you know but i i i i uh the regular ones you know the normal kids you can just let them_1 go a little bit and
sw2961A-ms98-a-0067 520.418625 527.007875 and and he sort of he's real good at keeping them in line i'm learning from him how to do these sort of things just just by watching him
sw2961A-ms98-a-0068 527.007875 529.352250 [silence]
sw2961A-ms98-a-0069 529.352250 531.416750 no it's it's boys and girls
sw2961A-ms98-a-0070 531.416750 546.030000 it it it it's mixed there are uh there are um more boys than girls but there are a number of number of girls in there who actually uh do some good stuff and beat up a lot of the little girls i mean i mean a lot of the little boys too
sw2961A-ms98-a-0071 546.030000 551.192500 [silence]
sw2961A-ms98-a-0072 551.192500 556.453125 um in some case actually a lot of parents send their kids or just bring their kids because
sw2961A-ms98-a-0073 556.453125 570.852750 because of the sort of discipline you know and it it's not we don't you know say get down and do a hundred push ups for me now you little guy but um it teaches we we we focus very highly on you know on on on issues of respect and self-discipline
sw2961A-ms98-a-0074 570.852750 585.258125 and self-confidence we have a lot of s[tudents]- kids who come in very shy you know and unsure of themselves and and you can see them come you know week by week that they come more and more out of their shells and start to become you know more sociable and more sure of themselves instead of more sure footed
sw2961A-ms98-a-0075 585.258125 599.663375 you know um and the parents love it actually they find you know we we we there are rules like the kids aren't allowed kids have to bring their report card in every after every quarter or whe[never]- or whenever they get their report cards they have to bring them in to make sure that they're keeping up with their grades
