sw2926A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.853125 [noise]
sw2926A-ms98-a-0002 0.853125 14.411625 well i guess um i'll start out and that is um i don't know what section of the public school system they're talking about whether it's the first eight grades the high school or colleges i have mixed views on all three of them
sw2926A-ms98-a-0003 14.411625 16.774875 [silence]
sw2926A-ms98-a-0004 16.774875 23.809000 well i- i- i should imagine the lower grades what would what what's what's certainly drawn everyone's attention to that
sw2926A-ms98-a-0005 23.809000 32.546125 is the fact that uh many of the inner city and uh i guess what we'd call uh ghetto or poorer districts including rural districts
sw2926A-ms98-a-0006 32.546125 47.477625 don't seem to be able to produce the students that ind[eed]- indeed many uh manufacturing and other enterprises want they can't seem to they can't seem to read properly do math properly and conform to what employers want
sw2926A-ms98-a-0007 47.477625 58.141625 so that's got everybody excited high schools i'm not too sure it seems that high schools at least produce candidates uh a[lthough]- although i have great misgivings about the SATs
sw2926A-ms98-a-0008 58.141625 62.885625 that go on to a variety of colleges it seems a great deal of our public colleges
sw2926A-ms98-a-0009 62.885625 71.042750 have foreign students in them uh from um a myriad of nations and uh and also um uh i think that
sw2926A-ms98-a-0010 71.042750 79.725250 uh a certain percentage of uh the colleges produce a fairly de[cent]- uh public colleges produce a fairly decent student or fairly decent graduate i should say
sw2926A-ms98-a-0011 79.725250 90.114250 [silence]
sw2926A-ms98-a-0012 90.114250 92.573375 oh i didn't realize it was that high
sw2926A-ms98-a-0013 92.573375 94.101625 [silence]
sw2926A-ms98-a-0014 94.101625 95.467875 wow

sw2926A-ms98-a-0016 96.794500 98.501375 [laughter]
sw2926A-ms98-a-0017 98.501375 103.065500 yeah well that's what i was going to point out i think it mostly is that technical
sw2926A-ms98-a-0018 103.065500 108.626375 [silence]
sw2926A-ms98-a-0019 108.626375 110.234750 yeah
sw2926A-ms98-a-0020 110.234750 113.108500 [silence]
sw2926A-ms98-a-0021 113.108500 114.682750 wow

sw2926A-ms98-a-0023 125.589250 126.880500 yeah
sw2926A-ms98-a-0024 126.880500 135.105000 [silence]
sw2926A-ms98-a-0025 135.105000 144.327875 yeah that yeah that must be an inner school i just read a an amazing article i guess in this month's New this week's New Yorker about Baltimore 
sw2926A-ms98-a-0026 144.327875 157.160875 uh which uh went on to talk about i don't know i thought it was rather slanted in favor of the mayor or or or the politicians in the in there i d[o]- i do i do know a few people and have been have done some business up in Baltimore
sw2926A-ms98-a-0027 157.160875 169.955375 but it seemed to me that the inner school system there was the one thing that didn't s[ystem]- the inner city school system was the one thing that didn't flower too well they talked about individual cases of people trying hard but it was very difficult
sw2926A-ms98-a-0028 169.955375 175.392750 i- i- i- i think if i was going to fault it now if i'm i'm looking to carry on a conversation
sw2926A-ms98-a-0029 175.392750 188.688500 that way i thi[nk]- there's a couple of things that really bother me i think when i learned the other day uh uh that uh the average American the average American now watches seven point two hours of television a day
sw2926A-ms98-a-0030 188.688500 199.668250 and that school children uh a[re]- are not far off that mark with six point eight now i don't know what school children what year that is i mean that's a hell of a lot time to be sitting in front of the tube
sw2926A-ms98-a-0031 199.668250 204.154750 [silence]
sw2926A-ms98-a-0032 204.154750 205.370250 well i
sw2926A-ms98-a-0033 205.370250 206.655500 yeah
sw2926A-ms98-a-0034 206.655500 207.756250 [silence]
sw2926A-ms98-a-0035 207.756250 210.804125 really oh so you're close to the subject
sw2926A-ms98-a-0036 210.804125 213.750625 [silence]
sw2926A-ms98-a-0037 213.750625 224.698750 and yet you know i have grandchildren i have ten uh nine grandchildren uh in various parts of the country and of course you know i can't speak to the
sw2926A-ms98-a-0038 224.698750 235.373875 rural or poorer inner city schools these kids go to a f[airly]- they live in a fairly nice upper scale neighborhood and they seem to be doing extraordinarily well i- i- i mean i quiz them and i talk to them and they
sw2926A-ms98-a-0039 235.373875 239.753125 they read well they do everything well but i- i- i mean i think that's a
sw2926A-ms98-a-0040 239.753125 241.903375 that's part of the environment
sw2926A-ms98-a-0041 241.903375 245.176750 [silence]
sw2926A-ms98-a-0042 245.176750 248.804625 yeah that that that that could be very well true
sw2926A-ms98-a-0043 248.804625 250.483875 yeah
sw2926A-ms98-a-0044 250.483875 252.212250 [silence]

sw2926A-ms98-a-0050 259.429375 262.443875 [silence]
sw2926A-ms98-a-0051 262.443875 275.685875 no kidding oh i- i- i yeah i guess i could i can understand that oh i'm a product of the New York City public school system from fifty years ago uh maybe not that long ago but and um and so i- i
sw2926A-ms98-a-0052 275.685875 282.647125 always felt i didn't get a real good education in the pu[blic]- in the grammar schools and part of high school
sw2926A-ms98-a-0053 282.647125 290.389625 so i lived in New England at the time i sent all my children to prep school i was i w[ell]- i didn't have that much money but we struggled and we did it and i thought it
sw2926A-ms98-a-0054 290.389625 299.286000 i thought a great deal of it was a great deal of the success that they had in their education was due to the low student teacher ratio
sw2926A-ms98-a-0055 299.286000 307.334125 and i- i- i think that could that's a formula that could be applied everywhere except it must cost a heck of a lot of money if you [laughter-do] it in public school 
sw2926A-ms98-a-0056 307.334125 310.344875 [silence]
sw2926A-ms98-a-0057 310.344875 311.839000 yeah

sw2926A-ms98-a-0065 326.678625 339.992000 well that that that's that that must be then then if that's uh i think we both agree on that then then then then a parent parental involvement has to be there and i guess you got to take them away from the tube also another thing that i have another
sw2926A-ms98-a-0066 339.992000 345.283125 problem i have is uh i don't really know how to resolve this but is the
sw2926A-ms98-a-0067 345.283125 357.333500 incredible at least in the high school and college level emphasis on sports where enormous amounts of money are spent and it seems to me that mo[ney]- money could be more well well spent somewhere else

sw2926A-ms98-a-0087 408.721500 412.576875 yeah i know but i mean they don't just send it to the new stadium or

sw2926A-ms98-a-0098 438.708250 446.498250 well i- i never thought of that benefit but the consequence then i my i guess what i'd have to say about that is there can only be one [laughter-champion]
sw2926A-ms98-a-0099 446.498250 448.065875 [laughter]
sw2926A-ms98-a-0100 448.065875 451.472625 isn't that something though i didn't realize that

sw2926A-ms98-a-0119 509.981000 524.242000 i read i- i also read i we're getting off the subject here a bit but i- i do want to add this to that because i- i was quite interested in that myself but i read where the reason that he had to do this in the sprint events is that national television wouldn't pay
sw2926A-ms98-a-0120 524.242000 533.491875 for the l[ong]- distance events and they didn't think they could capture the excitement to get sponsors if you brought just the f[inish]- here he comes down the finish line right
sw2926A-ms98-a-0121 533.491875 543.352750 so it had to be it had to be where they could put it in one segment and g[et]- and and i guess capture the whole thing for some sponsor
sw2926A-ms98-a-0122 543.352750 545.650000 let me ask you another question
sw2926A-ms98-a-0123 545.650000 559.928250 yeah well i[f]- if you teach c[ollege]- uh college and and i know when i went to college i- i went to summer school and i thought that uh in fact that uh m[y]- my idea of it was uh rather than
sw2926A-ms98-a-0124 559.928250 567.270625 rather than finish early i just enjoyed some of the subjects that i was taking and i had the ability to to go in summer school and i
sw2926A-ms98-a-0125 567.270625 580.159250 i didn't didn't take those subjects so what that leads me my next thought is i understand there's a lot of talk now about extending the school year which seems inordinately short anyway compared to the Japanese or the Germans
sw2926A-ms98-a-0126 580.159250 583.401625 well how do you think that would work in grammar schools and
sw2926A-ms98-a-0127 583.401625 589.728000 [silence]
sw2926A-ms98-a-0128 589.728000 598.030125 yeah yeah that's [laughter-right] [laughter] yeah
