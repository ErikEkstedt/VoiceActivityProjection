sw2926B-ms98-a-0016 83.620500 90.338125 colleges now uh graduate programs in general now train basically they're fifty percent foreign [noise]
sw2926B-ms98-a-0017 90.338125 97.098625 uh yeah all just about fi[fty]- when you consider um when you [laughter-consider] uh 
sw2926B-ms98-a-0018 97.098625 109.185125 especially in technical areas science engineering and computers yeah especially in those areas it's um [noise] i kn[ow]- it's it's almost fifty per cent foreign like forty eight percent and that involves both Canadian
sw2926B-ms98-a-0019 109.185125 121.696125 and uh uh European Middle Eastern and and Far Eastern yeah i- i think um [noise] i think i have similar views that's you know where our elementary grades um
sw2926B-ms98-a-0020 121.696125 129.253875 i[t]- it's amazing i have a friend who's an e[lementary]- who's an elementary school teacher and she said that they recently
sw2926B-ms98-a-0021 129.253875 137.938500 you know they have to go through they have to they have to pat the kids down because they bring guns to school she teaches in the city of Baltimore and that

sw2926B-ms98-a-0050 246.087250 249.769125 she she's yeah she can tell
sw2926B-ms98-a-0051 249.769125 259.410125 she can tell you know when they have kids come in for they meet with all of the parents and she can tell before a parent comes in normally you know give or take eighty ninety percent
sw2926B-ms98-a-0052 259.410125 264.758125 you know what the parents are going to be like when they come in and the responses the parents will give back oh yeah

sw2926B-ms98-a-0062 297.784625 300.662750 i think i think it's probably very true

sw2926B-ms98-a-0064 303.991250 305.268500 um-hum

sw2926B-ms98-a-0066 306.572625 317.431250 but you know surprisingly i- i because you put such a commitment on education um your children probably could have gone to schools with uh uh a higher
sw2926B-ms98-a-0067 317.431250 329.881000 student teacher ratio and still done well because when they would come home you and your wife would say you know what did you do today if we let's sit down and read together yeah um-hum

sw2926B-ms98-a-0069 331.028125 333.135125 yeah oh it's parental
sw2926B-ms98-a-0070 333.135125 336.526625 yep um-hum yeah
sw2926B-ms98-a-0071 336.526625 355.562875 [silence]
sw2926B-ms98-a-0072 355.562875 363.734250 but you kn[ow]- you know what's really funny is that they there's been some research because_1 i'm a i'm a college professor [noise] and um uh and and
sw2926B-ms98-a-0073 363.734250 371.696500 w[ell]- a lot of the research shows that like Georgetown while Ewing was playing at Georgetown basketball Georgetown
sw2926B-ms98-a-0074 371.696500 373.288125 and they were winning
sw2926B-ms98-a-0075 373.288125 377.703250 endowment to the university in other words money that could go to everything
sw2926B-ms98-a-0076 377.703250 389.340750 everything and normally gets directed away from sports realistically a lot of the was uh was probably two thirds i guess it's now two thirds of what it was
sw2926B-ms98-a-0077 389.340750 395.446250 when they were national champions in other words while they're national champions people donate more money
sw2926B-ms98-a-0078 395.446250 405.448500 average human beings like you and i average Joes that make a decent salary that are a graduate of the school send big bucks like couple hundreds of dollars but thousands of people
sw2926B-ms98-a-0079 405.448500 406.580625 [silence]
sw2926B-ms98-a-0080 406.580625 409.834375 because no bec[ause]- normally it's because of the sports
sw2926B-ms98-a-0081 409.834375 410.885000 [silence]
sw2926B-ms98-a-0082 410.885000 414.669875 right right but see the sports brings in the money
sw2926B-ms98-a-0083 414.669875 428.931750 because when Georgetown was number one their their their m[oney]- money that was donated to them from companies from from l[ocal]- from business people from graduates whatever was up into you know like twenty million dollars and now it's down to like fourteen million
sw2926B-ms98-a-0084 428.931750 431.137750 during that time period in o[ther]- other words
sw2926B-ms98-a-0085 431.137750 439.002875 their income has slow[ly]- their their al[umni]- alumni giving and other funds have slowly dropped since then
sw2926B-ms98-a-0086 439.002875 440.374000 um-hum
sw2926B-ms98-a-0087 440.374000 441.996125 yeah
sw2926B-ms98-a-0088 441.996125 443.405250 [silence]
sw2926B-ms98-a-0089 443.405250 444.986375 yeah
sw2926B-ms98-a-0090 444.986375 445.646250 [silence]
sw2926B-ms98-a-0091 445.646250 460.038625 that's yeah it's it's amazing the way but now that's big time yeah but but uh smaller schools aren't like that uh only only the big time schools show that but you're right i- i think the emphasis on sports and as a see i'm a i'm a i'm a former athlete in a sense i swam
sw2926B-ms98-a-0092 460.038625 464.292375 um but swimming never gets much glory so it really doesn't matter but 
sw2926B-ms98-a-0093 464.292375 467.757375 that's true that's true but you know they still
sw2926B-ms98-a-0094 467.757375 480.417625 he didn't make it no i- i would have liked it if he if he would have though but i think uh realistically you know you read the the research studies and uh i don't think he would have made it simply because
sw2926B-ms98-a-0095 480.417625 485.963500 the w[ell]- the event he was trying to swim they even the research shows that distance running
sw2926B-ms98-a-0096 485.963500 495.028375 so i would assume distance swimming might be similar that and he was good at distance splits as a swimmer you know at i can remember that but the distance um [noise]
sw2926B-ms98-a-0097 495.028375 505.832000 the the distance strength and endurance or whatever sort of starts to peak at about twenty eight twenty nine thirty that's why some of your long distance runners were in their l[ate]- early thirties
sw2926B-ms98-a-0098 505.832000 511.408125 and but he's was trying to make it in the sprinter's event and most of them are under twenty five
sw2926B-ms98-a-0099 511.408125 513.800000 um-hum yeah

sw2926B-ms98-a-0118 579.657375 582.331875 yeah i think i think
sw2926B-ms98-a-0119 582.331875 591.246500 i think uh in in some sense um what i would do before i would extend a school year is i would make it better before i would continue the agony
sw2926B-ms98-a-0120 591.246500 599.838000 and something you have to consider too um because i know a[s]- as a as a as a former high school teacher i know that from right now
