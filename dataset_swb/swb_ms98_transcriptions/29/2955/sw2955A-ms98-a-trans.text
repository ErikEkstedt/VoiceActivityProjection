sw2955A-ms98-a-0013 54.692375 66.056625 well i think it's uh basically the same way it's certainly has affected uh US policy though there's no question it had an overwhelming effect of how we approached the the thing in uh Iraq
sw2955A-ms98-a-0014 66.056625 74.060250 because_1 uh the whole thing that was bad about Vietnam was no different from Iraq i mean it was uh one country picking on a smaller weaker one
sw2955A-ms98-a-0015 74.060250 87.197875 yeah the only difference was that the government said okay if we're going to support this smaller country then we're going to support it a hundred percent and we're going to consider ourselves against in war against these people as well
sw2955A-ms98-a-0016 87.197875 94.610125 which uh right which really wasn't the attitude with Vietnam it was sort of a president's war rather than a country's war
