sw2955B-ms98-a-0024 104.442125 107.940875 it really well yeah in fact because_1 in terms of when your
sw2955B-ms98-a-0025 107.940875 115.841125 there's at least ten years between us so in terms of when you were in school i'm sure that it was you know the majority of your high school and junior high years um
sw2955B-ms98-a-0026 115.841125 124.041125 one of the things i didn't like was the weapon the weapons i can't even say it the weaponry th[at]- systems that they used um it just didn't seem that um
sw2955B-ms98-a-0027 124.041125 130.629125 i don't know technically we knew what we were doing either then you heard about the things like agent orange et cetera and you'd think [noise]
sw2955B-ms98-a-0028 130.629125 137.655125 you know just uh how could the government or the Pentagon uh whom[ever]- whomever's in charge there been so careless
sw2955B-ms98-a-0029 137.655125 138.900750 um

sw2955B-ms98-a-0034 153.845000 162.306250 um monetarily too i just don't think we've done enough for the uh Vietnamese people as a whole um in South Vietnam in general in helping them restore themselves
sw2955B-ms98-a-0035 162.306250 166.056375 you know and i don't know if it's because_1 there aren't any oil fields there [laughter]

sw2955B-ms98-a-0037 168.033750 180.017250 yeah i mean i don't think they do but i just think it's kind of a shame that uh you still hear things about the children that are orphans there and um so on a whole i don't know war isn't good and that one i probably um
sw2955B-ms98-a-0038 180.017250 184.495875 my main opinion would be [vocalized-noise] we shouldn't have done it 
sw2955B-ms98-a-0039 184.495875 190.172750 well that's what i know about the Vietnam [laughter-War] unless you have

sw2955B-ms98-a-0057 244.244125 249.537500 so it really i mean because_1 i know in nineteen sixty three i mean i was nine years old when Kennedy was shot
sw2955B-ms98-a-0058 249.537500 258.913750 so i mean i remember um right around then that that's when i first started hearing about Vietnam but then as i got older and studied in school i realized it was even going on before that
sw2955B-ms98-a-0059 258.913750 269.537625 you know and you think to yourself oh my goodness Eisenhower [laughter] that sounds ancient yeah and i know i know you know a lot of the Vietnam vets that are my age in their later thirties um guys that i know that
