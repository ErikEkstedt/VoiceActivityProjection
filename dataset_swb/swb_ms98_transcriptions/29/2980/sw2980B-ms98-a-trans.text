sw2980B-ms98-a-0056 287.470000 295.764000 i'm not involved in it myself you know but uh just hearing what is going on at TI is very uh fascinating
sw2980B-ms98-a-0057 295.764000 300.925500 and i don't know that much about it i know that um in the group that i was working in there was
sw2980B-ms98-a-0058 300.925500 314.065750 an area that was really focused on speech recognition however i'm not in that uh organization any more within TI i'm in uh a different area of TI now working on something totally different
sw2980B-ms98-a-0059 314.065750 322.734875 so uh my interest was spurred and then it [laughter-was] [laughter-uh] taken away because i i um was moved out of that area

sw2980B-ms98-a-0070 370.328875 373.939125 and going into the direction where they're gifted in
sw2980B-ms98-a-0071 373.939125 375.637125 that's wonderful
