sw2980A-ms98-a-0002 0.470375 2.824125 are you a computer professional
sw2980A-ms98-a-0003 2.824125 15.457125 [silence]
sw2980A-ms98-a-0004 15.457125 19.320500 but are you working at the Texas Instruments or are you at home
sw2980A-ms98-a-0005 19.320500 20.989625 [silence]
sw2980A-ms98-a-0006 20.989625 22.420500 okay
sw2980A-ms98-a-0007 22.420500 26.076500 uh what's what's your application for PC's
sw2980A-ms98-a-0008 26.076500 37.566000 [silence]
sw2980A-ms98-a-0009 37.566000 39.239750 oh okay
sw2980A-ms98-a-0010 39.239750 44.798750 [silence]
sw2980A-ms98-a-0011 44.798750 45.862750 um-hum
sw2980A-ms98-a-0012 45.862750 49.444500 [silence]
sw2980A-ms98-a-0013 49.444500 51.048375 oh okay
sw2980A-ms98-a-0014 51.048375 56.651625 well i got involved in uh computers because i have an interest in speech recognition
sw2980A-ms98-a-0015 56.651625 61.124125 which is probably why i got involved in the TI switchboard project
sw2980A-ms98-a-0016 61.124125 70.441125 [silence]
sw2980A-ms98-a-0017 70.441125 73.685000 and will probably be pursuing it for a long time to come [laughter]
sw2980A-ms98-a-0018 73.685000 76.310750 [laughter] 
sw2980A-ms98-a-0019 76.310750 77.916000 yeah
sw2980A-ms98-a-0020 77.916000 88.259625 well i bought a uh PC oh well i bought a series of personal computers of one kind or another but the latest one i bought for the children
sw2980A-ms98-a-0021 88.259625 96.042375 to use uh for their educational games and and for entertainment games
sw2980A-ms98-a-0022 96.042375 103.968500 and i soon discovered that it was running faster than the IBM PCAT that i had purchased to do my uh uh
sw2980A-ms98-a-0023 103.968500 106.103000 postgraduate studies
sw2980A-ms98-a-0024 106.103000 107.524250 [silence]
sw2980A-ms98-a-0025 107.524250 112.482750 so i've uh i've taken over the children's computer [laughter]
sw2980A-ms98-a-0026 112.482750 116.422500 and uh enhanced with uh uh
sw2980A-ms98-a-0027 116.422500 119.537500 uh Texas Instrument[s]- DSP board
sw2980A-ms98-a-0028 119.537500 124.301625 and i'm using it for uh speech recognition research at this point
sw2980A-ms98-a-0029 124.301625 127.083500 [silence]
sw2980A-ms98-a-0030 127.083500 134.741500 well i've gotten to the point where the program will phonetically label a sentence that i speak into the microphone
sw2980A-ms98-a-0031 134.741500 136.712750 [silence]
sw2980A-ms98-a-0032 136.712750 146.403875 and uh it's it's just now up and running in that mode and i've got to make a lot of improvements and uh improve my models and
sw2980A-ms98-a-0033 146.403875 153.967500 adjust coefficients and try to improve the performance a little bit but the first results look promising
sw2980A-ms98-a-0034 153.967500 175.055750 [silence]
sw2980A-ms98-a-0035 175.055750 178.011750 i think we're getting to the point now where
sw2980A-ms98-a-0036 178.011750 191.284875 uh there's a lot of people who've done research in a lot of individual areas and we're sort of entering the phase now where i think we're starting to pull some of these results together and getting them_1 to work together
sw2980A-ms98-a-0037 191.284875 198.298125 [silence]
sw2980A-ms98-a-0038 198.298125 201.348125 well not really uh but
sw2980A-ms98-a-0039 201.348125 202.447750 [silence]
sw2980A-ms98-a-0040 202.447750 207.998875 well my company has has expressed an interest and they've asked me to do a lot of research so
sw2980A-ms98-a-0041 207.998875 220.066250 i've been traveling around the company country talking to uh different groups i spent uh three or four days in Boston earlier this year talking to MIT and uh Bobrank and [vocalized-noise]
sw2980A-ms98-a-0042 220.066250 231.356500 and a place named Sonotek uh just to find out what their state of the art is and i see what's out there that can all be brought to bear on the problem 
sw2980A-ms98-a-0043 231.356500 240.794750 and i think the focus of my dissertation is to uh to look at four different uh technologies that have already been researched and
sw2980A-ms98-a-0044 240.794750 247.689750 see if i can't make them work together in synergy to to get a step ahead 
sw2980A-ms98-a-0045 247.689750 259.317250 and uh so i think that's probably the way things will go in the future th[ey'll]- th[ey'll]- they'll start pulling together the different aspects of speech recognition i would say that there will be
sw2980A-ms98-a-0046 259.317250 264.690625 well there'll certainly be a lot of commercial products on the market in the next five years
sw2980A-ms98-a-0047 264.690625 269.779750 and there'll probably some be some very good systems available by the turn of the century
sw2980A-ms98-a-0048 269.779750 272.829750 [silence]
sw2980A-ms98-a-0049 272.829750 277.049250 yeah uh there'll probably be some
sw2980A-ms98-a-0050 277.049250 282.490375 you know reasonable breakthroughs in terms of uh bringing products to market
sw2980A-ms98-a-0051 282.490375 295.548250 [silence]
sw2980A-ms98-a-0052 295.548250 296.715750 um-hum
sw2980A-ms98-a-0053 296.715750 307.641125 [silence]
sw2980A-ms98-a-0054 307.641125 308.784875 um-hum
sw2980A-ms98-a-0055 308.784875 322.364875 [silence]
sw2980A-ms98-a-0056 322.364875 323.860250 yeah
sw2980A-ms98-a-0057 323.860250 326.548125 yeah i think it's an interesting field and
sw2980A-ms98-a-0058 326.548125 328.158750 [silence]
sw2980A-ms98-a-0059 328.158750 331.858375 my primary interest is in speech understanding
sw2980A-ms98-a-0060 331.858375 339.615000 uh so once we get the the basic word recognition or something resembling word recognition
sw2980A-ms98-a-0061 339.615000 350.455750 uh my interest is in extracting the understanding and in developing uh man machine dialogue type operations like intelligent tutoring systems that uh
sw2980A-ms98-a-0062 350.455750 361.016000 the tutoring system can sort of gain some insight into what the student knows or doesn't know and modify it's tutoring program accordingly
sw2980A-ms98-a-0063 361.016000 366.042750 and uh getting the interactive speech is a key part of that
sw2980A-ms98-a-0064 366.042750 367.158625 but
sw2980A-ms98-a-0065 367.158625 370.170250 [silence]
sw2980A-ms98-a-0066 370.170250 371.415000 right
sw2980A-ms98-a-0067 371.415000 373.601125 [silence]
sw2980A-ms98-a-0068 373.601125 375.207500 um-hum
sw2980A-ms98-a-0069 375.207500 384.482250 well it's it's all of parallels techniques that teachers ordinarily use during the day they they're teaching a grade stool grade school student to
sw2980A-ms98-a-0070 384.482250 398.024750 add and subtract they they pose problems for them and they see where they make their mistakes in in carrying or uh in borrowing or something like that and they then pose problems which will
sw2980A-ms98-a-0071 398.024750 404.519250 you know point out the proper procedure and then test them_1 again to see that they've learned that fact
sw2980A-ms98-a-0072 404.519250 412.430750 and so that's that's where the artificial intelligence comes in is is in -[de]veloping that kind of an art in a machine
sw2980A-ms98-a-0073 412.430750 430.440750 [silence]
