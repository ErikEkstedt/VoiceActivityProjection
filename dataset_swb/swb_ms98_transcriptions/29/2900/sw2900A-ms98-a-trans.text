sw2900A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.254375 [noise]
sw2900A-ms98-a-0002 0.254375 12.323625 um i guess my feelings are that uh we almost have a universal health care system uh to a great degree except that now i read where we've left out about thirty four million people
sw2900A-ms98-a-0003 12.323625 26.796625 and um i don't know exactly how we're gonna cover many of these people because i'm sure that some of them uh don't uh don't have the wherewithal to do it themselves so uh i- i have a feeling since i have
sw2900A-ms98-a-0004 26.796625 38.594625 just about as good a health care coverage that anybody can get that this uh then becomes an obligation of the government because it's gonna become an obligation of either state local or federal government anyway
sw2900A-ms98-a-0005 38.594625 44.547750 [silence]
sw2900A-ms98-a-0006 44.547750 54.159750 well it seems to me that that i'm paying anyway because when i go or my insurance carrier anyway when i pay something the bills seem inordinately high
sw2900A-ms98-a-0007 54.159750 63.693000 and the reason that they're inordinately high is because that has to cover the costs for the indigent people who apparently don't have the money or the wherewithal to do that
sw2900A-ms98-a-0008 63.693000 67.835375 would seem to spread it out a little better if the employers who 
sw2900A-ms98-a-0009 67.835375 79.800500 uh employ these people and pay them uh you know [laughter-{subminimum}] [laughter-wages] or whatever were asked to sh[are]- to share their fair burden of this too just as my employer is and myself i guess
sw2900A-ms98-a-0010 79.800500 84.561250 [silence]
sw2900A-ms98-a-0011 84.561250 86.399750 well
sw2900A-ms98-a-0012 86.399750 89.417500 well who who else is gonna do this then
sw2900A-ms98-a-0013 89.417500 95.173500 i mean it's worked successfully in Europe i've heard all these stories about i travel extensively
sw2900A-ms98-a-0014 95.173500 100.815250 and spend uh maybe half a year in Europe every year and i find that the health care programs there
sw2900A-ms98-a-0015 100.815250 104.942250 uh are administered with uh at least people i talk to
sw2900A-ms98-a-0016 104.942250 113.280875 with uh a great deal of integrity and uh people don't seem to be reluctant to use them to any degree as a matter of fact if i'm injured or
sw2900A-ms98-a-0017 113.280875 120.629750 have an emergency when i'm say in Germany or France uh that i'm automatically taken care of i mean i don't even have to pay
sw2900A-ms98-a-0018 120.629750 150.703375 [silence]
sw2900A-ms98-a-0019 150.703375 158.488125 well i uh uh i- i- i know it i have a solution you see uh m[y]- my solution even though i'm rapidly approaching the uh 
sw2900A-ms98-a-0020 158.488125 166.468875 the age when i'll qualify for Medicare and Medicaid i- i my mother and father both uh uh well my father's not living but my mother is
sw2900A-ms98-a-0021 166.468875 179.486000 and they are um o[f]- of an advanced years and when i see the money that's poured down the down the drain on Medicare and Medicaid i mean the absolute uncontrollable situation that we find ourselves in and the extraordinary amounts
sw2900A-ms98-a-0022 179.486000 190.451750 i know that because those people vote i mean they're the ones who get out and vote that's what's robbing a poor mother of the p[renatal]- prenatal care the young people aren't getting the proper care that they need and nutrition i think
sw2900A-ms98-a-0023 190.451750 200.107500 and we're spending on these useless many times useless and inordinately complex unnecessary tests in hospitals for older people
sw2900A-ms98-a-0024 200.107500 207.599500 [silence]
sw2900A-ms98-a-0025 207.599500 220.979250 that's right i mean it does seem like we're th[e]- th[e]- th[e]- now i noticed just the other day in the paper that that Medicare will be based payments will be based not uh just on cost but on cost effectiveness so i gue[ss]-
sw2900A-ms98-a-0026 220.979250 227.741125 well i don't know uh we'll see how that goes i think that was just a regulation that was up for comment but we'll see what happens
sw2900A-ms98-a-0027 227.741125 235.165875 well listen uh i think i've i've exhausted my uh self on at least i've blown off steam of the way i feel about it
sw2900A-ms98-a-0028 235.165875 239.075500 okay see you next time bye
sw2900A-ms98-a-0029 239.075500 240.381750 [silence]
