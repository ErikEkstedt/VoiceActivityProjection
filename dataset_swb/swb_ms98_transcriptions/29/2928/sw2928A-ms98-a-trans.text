sw2928A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.161500 [noise]
sw2928A-ms98-a-0002 0.161500 8.574500 [silence]
sw2928A-ms98-a-0003 8.574500 20.822875 well as a matter of fact uh it's it's funny that i chose this subject because uh uh the city of Raleigh about six weeks ago has just uh put in a city wide recycling
sw2928A-ms98-a-0004 20.822875 34.961875 uh regime in which uh bottles and newspapers are recycled and a truck comes around uh once every couple of weeks and they separate your bottles for you and your newspapers and uh and they
sw2928A-ms98-a-0005 34.961875 47.941625 give you little uh or actually fairly large green plastic uh containers to put out curbside and all that so i think this is a real sign of progress here in the city of Raleigh
sw2928A-ms98-a-0006 47.941625 49.175625 [silence]
sw2928A-ms98-a-0007 49.175625 63.339250 they do all you have to do is you put all your glass in the bottom of this thing followed by your plastic followed by the newspapers and when they come around to pick it up they do all the separation so you only have one
sw2928A-ms98-a-0008 63.339250 65.533250 place to put stuff
sw2928A-ms98-a-0009 65.533250 73.125625 so they've made it uh they've made it convenient it used to be if you wanted to recycle you had to drive to a uh
sw2928A-ms98-a-0010 73.125625 82.441125 a central location in the city and then do all the separation yourself and a lot of people didn't do it just because the recycling location was so unpleasant
sw2928A-ms98-a-0011 82.441125 89.541750 because you know when you have all that amount of stuff pretty soon you have various kinds of vermin running around and
sw2928A-ms98-a-0012 89.541750 95.544750 women seem to have something against having mice running across their feet when they're trying to [laughter-recycle]
sw2928A-ms98-a-0013 95.544750 105.618750 [silence]
sw2928A-ms98-a-0014 105.618750 107.058500 right
sw2928A-ms98-a-0015 107.058500 135.358250 [silence]
sw2928A-ms98-a-0016 135.358250 136.716750 um-hum
sw2928A-ms98-a-0017 136.716750 161.368250 [silence]
sw2928A-ms98-a-0018 161.368250 162.847125 yeah
sw2928A-ms98-a-0019 162.847125 169.672375 [silence]
sw2928A-ms98-a-0020 169.672375 178.830750 i wonder what happens if somebody just misses with a bottle and it hits the asphalt i would think you'd just end up with a lot of broken glass unless you swept up everyday
sw2928A-ms98-a-0021 178.830750 189.445625 [silence]
sw2928A-ms98-a-0022 189.445625 190.776250 yeah
sw2928A-ms98-a-0023 190.776250 194.624250 [silence]
sw2928A-ms98-a-0024 194.624250 206.706500 yeah but uh it it it sounds let's see you you may you said one thing that uh uh you know just for the the sake of argument here um
sw2928A-ms98-a-0025 206.706500 219.924875 that that i'd like to bring up and that is whether it's the function of government to do the recycling rather than the individual consumer and i guess my opinion would be that that's maybe one of the few
sw2928A-ms98-a-0026 219.924875 225.526625 functions that government ought to do i can think of a lot of things that they shouldn't do that they do do
sw2928A-ms98-a-0027 225.526625 234.366125 but uh it seems like recycling is something that uh that the government ought to do and that everybody ought to pay for because i think in the long run
sw2928A-ms98-a-0028 234.366125 240.749500 it's one of those things that's that's of universal benefit to every citizen in the country
sw2928A-ms98-a-0029 240.749500 253.390000 [silence]
sw2928A-ms98-a-0030 253.390000 254.746500 right
sw2928A-ms98-a-0031 254.746500 257.153750 right right
sw2928A-ms98-a-0032 257.153750 279.599500 [silence]
sw2928A-ms98-a-0033 279.599500 281.441625 [noise] right 
sw2928A-ms98-a-0034 281.441625 298.426625 [silence]
sw2928A-ms98-a-0035 298.426625 312.887750 they pro[vide]- well they provide these big plastic uh boxes actually they're a good size box maybe uh eighteen uh inches by uh thirty inches in size and uh you know maybe fifteen inches deep
sw2928A-ms98-a-0036 312.887750 327.297875 a good sturdy plastic box and it's got uh some uh uh bungy cord uh kind of arrangement so when you put your newspapers on the top they don't blow away in the wind if it's windy and uh
sw2928A-ms98-a-0037 327.297875 331.559750 and then they they apparently built these rather uh
sw2928A-ms98-a-0038 331.559750 344.086625 uh fancy trucks that come around and have and have the various bins for the re[cyclable]- various colored glasses and a bin for the plastic and a place for the newspaper and they're kind of these high
sw2928A-ms98-a-0039 344.086625 354.332000 sort of uh high tech uh uh uh trash collector trucks they're big things too they must be as long as at least as long as a school bus
sw2928A-ms98-a-0040 354.332000 359.819375 and uh i'm sure it's costing the city of Raleigh money but of course
sw2928A-ms98-a-0041 359.819375 362.569625 i mean that comes out of the taxes and
sw2928A-ms98-a-0042 362.569625 374.186625 so the people are ultimately paying for it and i think [laughter-that] people ought to ultimately pay for the convenience of having newspapers and bottles and and plastics and all that
sw2928A-ms98-a-0043 374.186625 379.023375 [silence]
sw2928A-ms98-a-0044 379.023375 383.998000 well i think that they that they do attempt to uh
sw2928A-ms98-a-0045 383.998000 394.255750 that that that they they sell the the glass and the newspaper my understanding is that they don't meet expenses with it but that they offset a lot of expenses
sw2928A-ms98-a-0046 394.255750 404.943125 one of the problems with newsprint especially is that virgin newsprint costs about twenty five or thirty percent of what recycled newsprint costs so
sw2928A-ms98-a-0047 404.943125 417.866500 a newspaper company is not is not going to buy recycled newsprint when virgin newsprint is available at a third of the cost and i think one of the problems there is that
sw2928A-ms98-a-0048 417.866500 427.516125 is is the cost of virgin newsprint is not being accurate[ly]- accurately reflected because that cost ought to reflect the cost of recycling
sw2928A-ms98-a-0049 427.516125 429.619625 and
sw2928A-ms98-a-0050 429.619625 440.552875 and what the government needs to do really in a good capitalist society i mean capitalism thrives on there being a fair price for a product and
sw2928A-ms98-a-0051 440.552875 452.017750 and that price ought to has to include uh the cost of its disposal and it also has to include the cost of of any damage it inflicts on the environment
sw2928A-ms98-a-0052 452.017750 458.188000 and that's really where we as a capitalist society have gone have gone awry we have not
sw2928A-ms98-a-0053 458.188000 471.613125 really assigned costs appropriately for example the real cost of a barrel of oil if you take into account pollution and all of the other side effects is probably a hundred dollars a barrel
sw2928A-ms98-a-0054 471.613125 475.426500 now i'm just guessing but i bet you that that's an accurate guess
sw2928A-ms98-a-0055 475.426500 476.449625 [silence]
sw2928A-ms98-a-0056 476.449625 478.157125 and
sw2928A-ms98-a-0057 478.157125 492.308625 but we're we're paying twenty so the the cost is wrong on that thing and somewhere along the line you have to pay the piper that's what Adam Smith was saying hundreds of years ago as far as capitalism is concerned if you don't charge the right
sw2928A-ms98-a-0058 492.308625 503.773000 prices you're going to eventually that price is going to make itself felt but the way to make the system work is to is to put the price on the commodity and have the people who use the commodity pay that price
sw2928A-ms98-a-0059 503.773000 512.719625 and the role of government in a capitalist society is to see that that happens and the way government uh does that is through taxation
sw2928A-ms98-a-0060 512.719625 520.142750 so with newsprint for example the government should tax virgin newsprint to the point where
sw2928A-ms98-a-0061 520.142750 529.139875 its uh its price is pretty much the same as recycled newsprint and earmark that money for the recycling of newsprint you see what i mean
sw2928A-ms98-a-0062 529.139875 537.112375 so that the people who use the newsprint are ultimately paying for the entire product not only for its production but for its disposal
sw2928A-ms98-a-0063 537.112375 538.922500 [silence]
sw2928A-ms98-a-0064 538.922500 543.752125 hey i bet you didn't think you were going to get a lecture on [laughter] 
sw2928A-ms98-a-0065 543.752125 551.832125 [silence]
sw2928A-ms98-a-0066 551.832125 560.937625 well the the um of course most you know you can't recycle oil in the form of gasoline because it's destroyed
sw2928A-ms98-a-0067 560.937625 567.903000 so there's not a question of recycling there but there is a question of of uh environmental damage
sw2928A-ms98-a-0068 567.903000 569.432250 [silence]
sw2928A-ms98-a-0069 569.432250 571.369125 oh yeah
sw2928A-ms98-a-0070 571.369125 579.949625 [silence]
sw2928A-ms98-a-0071 579.949625 581.548625 uh-huh
sw2928A-ms98-a-0072 581.548625 597.669750 [silence]
sw2928A-ms98-a-0073 597.669750 599.427375 yeah i don't know when
