sw2928B-ms98-a-0005 47.502625 49.735750 they separate everything for you

sw2928B-ms98-a-0007 54.415500 55.196750 uh-huh

sw2928B-ms98-a-0019 95.246500 96.631750 yeah
sw2928B-ms98-a-0020 96.631750 100.094000 that sounds like it's uh a really a
sw2928B-ms98-a-0021 100.094000 107.875125 what you have to do basically you have to make it as easy and convenient for people as possible and
sw2928B-ms98-a-0022 107.875125 116.877000 unfortunately while the responsibility should be on the consumer it will be placed on the cities now
sw2928B-ms98-a-0023 116.877000 129.613875 because you know of the convenience factor i try to get as i try to save aluminum cans and uh plastic and all that and whether i get much for it or not doesn't really bother me but uh
sw2928B-ms98-a-0024 129.613875 143.420500 you know i live in Sherman Texas which is probably a small town of about i don't know twenty twenty five thousand and they have sites around in the community the the grocery stores are really helping out a lot
sw2928B-ms98-a-0025 143.420500 148.084000 they allow you they've got fenced in areas on their properties and
sw2928B-ms98-a-0026 148.084000 153.056625 and you go and uh drop off all your goods there but like you said you have to separate [noise] them_1
sw2928B-ms98-a-0027 153.056625 154.263250 and uh
sw2928B-ms98-a-0028 154.263250 159.284875 i don't know if it's really i don't think it's that bad cleanliness wise
sw2928B-ms98-a-0029 159.284875 170.217250 because it's there on the store's property and it's on a it's on con[crete]- it's on you know asphalt and there's huge trash bins but there may be some unsightly [noise] creatures running around
sw2928B-ms98-a-0030 170.217250 178.431750 [silence]
sw2928B-ms98-a-0031 178.431750 180.246125 yeah yeah i
sw2928B-ms98-a-0032 180.246125 184.131000 i don't drop mine off there i take mine in to a uh
sw2928B-ms98-a-0033 184.131000 196.424250 a uh a big metal recycling place that takes about everything and they pay you for it [noise] so i've never taken mine to the to grocery stores and dropped off [noise] but
sw2928B-ms98-a-0034 196.424250 213.655250 [silence]
sw2928B-ms98-a-0035 213.655250 214.438000 uh-huh
sw2928B-ms98-a-0036 214.438000 224.843250 [silence]
sw2928B-ms98-a-0037 224.843250 225.778375 uh-huh
sw2928B-ms98-a-0038 225.778375 240.307875 [silence]
sw2928B-ms98-a-0039 240.307875 241.666500 uh-huh
sw2928B-ms98-a-0040 241.666500 246.624125 well all i was saying was that to get it done it would have to take
sw2928B-ms98-a-0041 246.624125 251.357000 the the convenience a[nd]- and the burden would have to be placed
sw2928B-ms98-a-0042 251.357000 262.098375 on someone other than the consumer because the consumer just won't do it so if if government should do it you know somebody's got to do it and if if anybody it should be the government
sw2928B-ms98-a-0043 262.098375 269.644750 but you know ultimately it should be the responsibility of the consumer but that just won't happen it's unrealistic so uh
sw2928B-ms98-a-0044 269.644750 282.537375 you know in the ideal society everyone would uh buy all unrec[yclable]- all recyclable stuff and everything would get recycled and we wouldn't have any problem but uh uh that's
sw2928B-ms98-a-0045 282.537375 292.543250 not feasible so uh yeah the government should probably step in and uh take a little more charge and what's really good is um
sw2928B-ms98-a-0046 292.543250 299.325250 uh that the government there in Raleigh i mean they've you know they provide the bags didn't you say that

sw2928B-ms98-a-0056 373.393375 379.920875 uh-huh i wonder if uh the government there makes any money off the recycling
sw2928B-ms98-a-0057 379.920875 394.160000 [silence]

sw2928B-ms98-a-0078 542.010875 552.957875 no i didn't figure i'd get a lecture but yeah i never thought of that that's you know i didn't know there was such a price difference there what about oil recycling oil

sw2928B-ms98-a-0082 567.872500 574.314500 well i was talking about like motor oil because i had read an article about ten years ago that said
sw2928B-ms98-a-0083 574.314500 584.957500 it costs so much less to just clean up the motor oil that's that's used in the engine and run it through a few different processes than
sw2928B-ms98-a-0084 584.957500 599.427375 you know it's it's more economical to actually do that and i was just wondering if it's just slow because it's messy or because there aren't the facilities available to recycle the oil i was wondering if you knew anything about that
