sw2962A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.999875 [noise]
sw2962A-ms98-a-0002 0.999875 8.970750 well uh it seems to me that uh that i don't know whether the jury system uh i i shouldn't say i don't know i don't feel very
sw2962A-ms98-a-0003 8.970750 22.415125 uh stronger that the jury system should be changed it seems to have worked uh uh time immemorial and when uh difficult decisions uh are made uh uh uh they generally prove out to be right by things that occur later on
sw2962A-ms98-a-0004 22.415125 27.587875 uh i know in some cases now in some states depending on the criminal code 
sw2962A-ms98-a-0005 27.587875 39.961750 and uh a unanimous verdict isn't required and indeed some juries are no longer twelve people they're down to as little small as six people in i think in petty in in uh in uh minor felonies 
sw2962A-ms98-a-0006 39.961750 43.929875 and uh and misdemeanor trials 
sw2962A-ms98-a-0007 43.929875 45.966750 um
sw2962A-ms98-a-0008 45.966750 50.853500 i think that the judges should be left to do most of the sentencing simply because
sw2962A-ms98-a-0009 50.853500 62.101500 uh there's always uh there's there's always a jury that might be [laughter-swayed] uh by the moment uh to either be too lenient or too vengeful i guess
sw2962A-ms98-a-0010 62.101500 72.107000 [silence]
sw2962A-ms98-a-0011 72.107000 73.365500 yeah
sw2962A-ms98-a-0012 73.365500 74.917125 [silence]
sw2962A-ms98-a-0013 74.917125 81.806250 but i mean isn't that uh is that a reflection then of what's really happening in the real world if if if they keep giving everybody
sw2962A-ms98-a-0014 81.806250 92.007500 hundred year sentences and the people in various states it doesn't seem that people want to be taxed to build more prisons or even in for that matter
sw2962A-ms98-a-0015 92.007500 97.409250 uh repair the uh the lack of judges and and and other uh
sw2962A-ms98-a-0016 97.409250 104.779750 [silence]
sw2962A-ms98-a-0017 104.779750 106.668375 [laughter]
sw2962A-ms98-a-0018 106.668375 110.751875 yeah you know that might be it i mean they they certainly
sw2962A-ms98-a-0019 110.751875 119.522875 i don't i don't know how it is in Virginia but in Florida now uh uh uh at eighteen years someone was just sentenced to eighteen years i heard on Today
sw2962A-ms98-a-0020 119.522875 125.589750 uh without any specific recommendation for uh uh uh uh uh uh
sw2962A-ms98-a-0021 125.589750 139.288500 uh waving the normal uh procedures and the eighteen years will uh translate into something like uh four point seven if every if the if the prisoner is a model prisoner and indeed the present overcrowding conditions uh
sw2962A-ms98-a-0022 139.288500 144.905000 prevail plus i guess there was some credit for time this guy had already spent in jail waiting for trial
sw2962A-ms98-a-0023 144.905000 156.110250 so uh yeah you might be right about that i i i do not know it just seems to me that only about uh from what i read only about ninety percent of the ca[ses]- only about ten percent of the [vocalized-noise] cases come for trial anyway
sw2962A-ms98-a-0024 156.110250 164.292875 and uh only about uh f[our]- f[our]- four or five percent of uh in the in the very end or less than
sw2962A-ms98-a-0025 164.292875 174.211125 less than half the trials that go to uh uh less than half the cases that go to trial uh end up w[ith]- with uh with the jury actually making the verdict
sw2962A-ms98-a-0026 174.211125 180.808625 that most of it's plea bargained uh half way through or or uh most of the cases are plea bargained anyway
sw2962A-ms98-a-0027 180.808625 192.507125 but uh uh how do you feel about the about the jury system itself do you you think that should be changed or do do you know in Virginia whether it's if they have smaller juries or
sw2962A-ms98-a-0028 192.507125 198.477000 [silence]
sw2962A-ms98-a-0029 198.477000 199.822125 yeah
sw2962A-ms98-a-0030 199.822125 214.512250 [silence]
sw2962A-ms98-a-0031 214.512250 216.331625 yeah well i guess we do
sw2962A-ms98-a-0032 216.331625 217.606125 [silence]
sw2962A-ms98-a-0033 217.606125 220.985750 yeah i guess we always focus on criminal trials with with the jury but
sw2962A-ms98-a-0034 220.985750 226.374500 i know you have a right to ask for a jury in in any sort of a case that even where damages are
sw2962A-ms98-a-0035 226.374500 237.345375 are are uh a[re]- are the results of some sort of a uh an action that you're bringing against someone else you can ask for that to be heard before a jury takes a heck of a long time i guess to get there
sw2962A-ms98-a-0036 237.345375 247.000875 in some states i i i don't know uh i should imagine Virginia from what i read uh uh is like every other state it it's faced with uh
sw2962A-ms98-a-0037 247.000875 257.969375 uh enormous costs to maintain the jury system and the prison system and the entire trial system because i guess everywhere i read that there's a shortage of judges
sw2962A-ms98-a-0038 257.969375 261.904000 not that they won't appoint them_1 but there's no budget for them i guess or
sw2962A-ms98-a-0039 261.904000 267.561250 and the courthouse that goes with them and the bailiffs and the clerk uh or clerks
sw2962A-ms98-a-0040 267.561250 273.933625 so it seems uh no i i i don't think i'd change it the more i verbalize it i i don't think i'd want to change the system
sw2962A-ms98-a-0041 273.933625 276.457000 i don't know what we'd replace it with [laughter]
sw2962A-ms98-a-0042 276.457000 287.847875 [silence]
sw2962A-ms98-a-0043 287.847875 290.109250 yes
sw2962A-ms98-a-0044 290.109250 298.778000 [silence]
sw2962A-ms98-a-0045 298.778000 311.815875 uh and yet there are there are so many there are so many people in prison i mean the prison population uh as far as i i uh you know my impression of it is that it's that it's doubled in the last ten years and tripled in the last twenty
sw2962A-ms98-a-0046 311.815875 325.014875 i mean it so so i guess our population has grown some too but there there definitely is uh uh you know to me the one of the worst things that could ever happen uh from what i read and see and understand i mean i don't think i could handle prison
sw2962A-ms98-a-0047 325.014875 327.204125 i mean it was very difficult
sw2962A-ms98-a-0048 327.204125 330.238875 [silence]
sw2962A-ms98-a-0049 330.238875 334.478375 well there must be a a [vocalized-noise] a a a very great degree of that but
sw2962A-ms98-a-0050 334.478375 346.731750 but there again i i don't know if the the jury system itself uh comes in to play there i would think that one of the things that sort of bothers me is the ability of course that it's a constitutional right that the press
sw2962A-ms98-a-0051 346.731750 352.969125 must have here is the the interviewing of jurors after the trial i mean that it seems to me that
sw2962A-ms98-a-0052 352.969125 362.275250 that that when a jury makes a decision they shouldn't be asked uh before television cameras and newspaper reporters how they reached that decision i mean i don't
sw2962A-ms98-a-0053 362.275250 366.237125 i imagine there's a certain certain right of the press to have
sw2962A-ms98-a-0054 366.237125 372.128875 the ability to ask that but i i would think i if i did anything i'd protect the juror from
sw2962A-ms98-a-0055 372.128875 375.114875 from any sort of an inquisition after
sw2962A-ms98-a-0056 375.114875 378.988500 [silence]
sw2962A-ms98-a-0057 378.988500 381.208375 yeah yeah
sw2962A-ms98-a-0058 381.208375 386.609125 oh yeah yeah well i do a lot of business up in Washington i was there during the during the trial actually yeah
sw2962A-ms98-a-0059 386.609125 393.903625 [silence]
sw2962A-ms98-a-0060 393.903625 395.739375 yeah yeah yeah
sw2962A-ms98-a-0061 395.739375 411.142750 [silence]
sw2962A-ms98-a-0062 411.142750 414.651375 oh i felt that way i felt i felt
sw2962A-ms98-a-0063 414.651375 416.207875 no but
sw2962A-ms98-a-0064 416.207875 420.524125 yeah i always balanced in the in the situation i remember the jurors uh
sw2962A-ms98-a-0065 420.524125 431.241875 i thought to myself how did how did they only i think they only f[ound]- uh found him guilty on one count which was uh not even which was a class something felony which was not even punishable
sw2962A-ms98-a-0066 431.241875 440.518000 uh uh to the degree that they thought it but i don't know maybe when you're there in the r[oom]- in the courtroom yourself and you're sitting there and you've got to make a judgment on somebody
sw2962A-ms98-a-0067 440.518000 447.919375 and the prosecutors do a lousy job or maybe the evidence was as sensational as the media presented it i mean i i'm not making excuses for [noise]
sw2962A-ms98-a-0068 447.919375 449.370500 [noise] that might be it
sw2962A-ms98-a-0069 449.370500 452.486875 but i think i'm getting a call coming in
sw2962A-ms98-a-0070 452.486875 455.813875 all right nice talking with you thank you
sw2962A-ms98-a-0071 455.813875 457.666000 [noise]
