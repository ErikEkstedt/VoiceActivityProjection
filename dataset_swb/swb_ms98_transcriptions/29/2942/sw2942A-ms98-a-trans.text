sw2942A-ms98-a-0014 54.618625 56.273000 oh that's interesting
sw2942A-ms98-a-0015 56.273000 63.340000 i went to a a liberal arts school actually at first and you weren't really even um
sw2942A-ms98-a-0016 63.340000 68.028250 they didn't expect you to choose any sort of major or anything at all until you were
sw2942A-ms98-a-0017 68.028250 81.558750 in your second year and then you you know you had i think you had to pick it by the by the by the end of second you had to pick some sort of major but until then they didn't sort of force you they they sort of forced you to run around taking classes in everything until then
sw2942A-ms98-a-0018 81.558750 85.553875 certain requirements so that so that you had to sort of get a general feel for everything
sw2942A-ms98-a-0019 85.553875 87.410000 so it wasn't that specialized so that
sw2942A-ms98-a-0020 87.410000 90.666125 [silence]
sw2942A-ms98-a-0021 90.666125 91.976750 yeah

sw2942A-ms98-a-0024 97.191500 111.413500 um-hum i was just on a committee recently actually sponsored by uh the American Association for the Advancement of Science trying to sort of you know where where they were just trying to figure out how to fit science and liberal arts together you know
sw2942A-ms98-a-0025 111.413500 123.147750 because_1 there are people who are getting just wonderful science educations and not getting enough liberal arts and then the other way around as well people are getting just pure technical science educations and not getting very good liberal arts sorts of issues so
sw2942A-ms98-a-0026 123.147750 137.134125 [silence]

sw2942A-ms98-a-0030 146.802625 151.484000 that could be very help[ful]- [laughter]
sw2942A-ms98-a-0031 151.484000 162.387500 yeah well i figure that that that that's probably the thing that i would most tell any parent you know to te[ll]- to tell their kids i think probably make sure the kid goes to a school where they can get sort of a general education and
sw2942A-ms98-a-0032 162.387500 170.647250 save specialization i guess for graduate school unless they're sure they want early on they want to do something like engineering or something or they can

sw2942A-ms98-a-0036 194.009875 198.745750 yeah but tha[t's]- that's a good idea well where i am right now actually i'm at the University of Rochester
sw2942A-ms98-a-0037 198.745750 211.372375 and that's a pretty good engineering school i think i think we do some they have a pretty good engineering here they also have a pr[ogram]- a fairly large liberal arts college as well a sort of a s[eparate]- a separate you know co[llege]- uh ar[ts]- arts and sciences college um
sw2942A-ms98-a-0038 211.372375 226.294500 and i believe the engineers are sort of required to take classes in i[n]- in everything and i know people i do uh i do work in language processing and and and at least one person who's in my field started off as an engineer
sw2942A-ms98-a-0039 226.294500 238.758750 started off as an [vocalized-noise] ele[ctrical]- ele[ctrical]- an electrical engineer student and then switched over at some point into language processing because he found that he enjoyed it more so they do force them people are forced to sort of take all different kinds of classes here which i think is wonderful

sw2942A-ms98-a-0058 303.339375 306.227250 right you you don't need any philosophy at all in school
sw2942A-ms98-a-0059 306.227250 307.543375 um-hum
sw2942A-ms98-a-0060 307.543375 315.625375 or so[me]- yeah or or or or some other thought provoking area you know very true we had uh when i went to undergraduate we had uh um
sw2942A-ms98-a-0061 315.625375 326.225125 went to Brandeis don't know if you know of it or not um we had uh uh a requirement freshman year of just humanities then you were given a choice of
sw2942A-ms98-a-0062 326.225125 336.602000 um you know there were ten or twelve or whatever fift[een]- or fifteen different courses that that you could take but they all centered they all came out of Philosophy English and Literature departments and they were
sw2942A-ms98-a-0063 336.602000 349.432500 they were they were a set of assigned readings everybody had to read you know for so the first year Humanities courses everyone had to read the Iliad an[d]- and and so forth and what they did though was they all approached it from
sw2942A-ms98-a-0064 349.432500 357.741125 from very different you know s[o]- so they had you could have one class in the philosophy of something that that the philosophy of Greek mythology or something that actually approached this or um
sw2942A-ms98-a-0065 357.741125 364.518875 one literature you know or a l[iterature]- a literature course or just all sorts of different perspectives on it and people got to
sw2942A-ms98-a-0066 364.518875 372.702750 choo[se]- pick and choose but but by the end everyone had a good sample of of of sort of how to think about these things non scientifically you know and
sw2942A-ms98-a-0067 372.702750 384.267875 and uh and that sort of forced them but i believe that that that that that that that you one of the one of the best things to do at least for me in school was was i was sort of forced to take lots of different kinds of courses 
sw2942A-ms98-a-0068 384.267875 388.180375 um i was forced to take i think you know some sort of art history course
sw2942A-ms98-a-0069 388.180375 401.647375 and y[ou]- we all grumbled about it at first but then afterward we all wound up taking extra art history classes because it just seemed like something we we didn't totally know nothing about but just enjoyed very much doing and something i never would have done if i i[f]- if i wasn't forced to take it
sw2942A-ms98-a-0070 401.647375 403.037250 [silence]
sw2942A-ms98-a-0071 403.037250 404.364875 hum hum

sw2942A-ms98-a-0073 407.503125 416.310750 yes um-hum and that and that really is something that that i notice like uh i talk to a lot of my friends at schools that are more specialized and they don't have that
sw2942A-ms98-a-0074 416.310750 424.142125 they just you know they went in and took their courses that they were expected to take and that was all they never had some of the more fun classes i guess
sw2942A-ms98-a-0075 424.142125 427.257500 i feel a little more worldly now [laughter]
sw2942A-ms98-a-0076 427.257500 433.034125 [silence]
sw2942A-ms98-a-0077 433.034125 436.400750 yes i'm i'm i'm hoping i'm hoping
sw2942A-ms98-a-0078 436.400750 437.991625 [silence]
sw2942A-ms98-a-0079 437.991625 442.927500 yes i i graduated um college in eighty seven and i just went straight through
sw2942A-ms98-a-0080 442.927500 455.265250 um i'm finishing up next year so yeah i d[idn't]- i didn't take any break or anything yet [noise] i've been trying actually in graduate school i've been trying to do the same thing take courses outs[ide]- it's completely outside my area and i'm finding that in graduate school it's a lot harder [laughter]
sw2942A-ms98-a-0081 455.265250 458.631500 because_1 uh i just don't have the time anymore to sort of sit in a course
sw2942A-ms98-a-0082 458.631500 465.281500 that i'm not getting graded for whereas before i would just sign up for credit for it now i can't sign up for an art history course for credit necessarily
sw2942A-ms98-a-0083 465.281500 471.938125 so i have to try and go myself and i went for like two or three weeks and realized not enough time for the work unfortunately
sw2942A-ms98-a-0084 471.938125 473.857375 [silence]
sw2942A-ms98-a-0085 473.857375 477.627750 i'm pursuing a Doctorate in Psychology so i'm just
sw2942A-ms98-a-0086 477.627750 480.276000 wind up spending a lot of time doing that instead
sw2942A-ms98-a-0087 480.276000 481.832000 uh
sw2942A-ms98-a-0088 481.832000 485.560375 what else i i think i [vocalized-noise] oh
sw2942A-ms98-a-0089 485.560375 488.990125 [silence]
sw2942A-ms98-a-0090 488.990125 491.014250 oh

sw2942A-ms98-a-0096 518.808125 520.855375 and that helped you think

sw2942A-ms98-a-0101 537.258000 546.027125 my wife is sort of in the real world and i so i sort of hinge halfway out in the real world getting you know real world [vocalized-noise] especially she works in uh um
sw2942A-ms98-a-0102 546.027125 560.087000 she works in something i she she works for a temporary agency a[nd]- and i and i never would have had she's the office supervisor i never would have had any i['ve]- i've learned much just sort of by watching her and her and her business as well so yeah so i i can see where that might be a
