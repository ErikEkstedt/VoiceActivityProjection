sw2990A-ms98-a-0002 1.130375 9.494875 um i guess my music taste musical tastes uh run pretty much the gambit i listen to a little bit of everything
sw2990A-ms98-a-0003 9.494875 18.462750 uh yeah uh i i grew up in east Texas listening to m[ostly]- m[ostly]- mostly country type music country and western type stuff
sw2990A-ms98-a-0004 18.462750 25.537625 uh and of course uh grew up also with rock and roll so i'm that's pretty much ingrained
sw2990A-ms98-a-0005 25.537625 31.888250 uh right now most of my musical uh e[xperiences]- experiences are with radio
sw2990A-ms98-a-0006 31.888250 45.411750 we listen to one of the local uh y[ou]- what's usually the number one local rock type station uh adult contemporary soft rock Ron Chapman [laughter] right
sw2990A-ms98-a-0007 45.411750 49.556750 and uh so we we listen to that uh pretty much all the time

sw2990A-ms98-a-0017 74.665750 82.943250 well it's i i was just thinking uh you know we we say or KVIL says i thi[nk]- i think they call theirs uh adult contemporary
sw2990A-ms98-a-0018 82.943250 91.170375 uh which means soft rock or ear[ly]- early type rock music and and that's really what i what i consider rock and roll
sw2990A-ms98-a-0019 91.170375 93.852500 it's uh not rock
sw2990A-ms98-a-0020 93.852500 94.607625 right
sw2990A-ms98-a-0021 94.607625 95.979000 [silence]
sw2990A-ms98-a-0022 95.979000 104.730875 um-hum well it's that's funny because i even when i first heard the Beatles i couldn't stand them you know it took it took a a while before i really liked the Beatles

sw2990A-ms98-a-0024 106.010500 110.238375 well i doubt that [laughter]
sw2990A-ms98-a-0025 110.238375 124.164000 yeah i i might have been too old for the Beatles that might have been what it was [laughter] i was past that point when they came [laughter-along] uh but uh i i grew up uh listening to Elvis you know be[fore]- even before the Beatles so
sw2990A-ms98-a-0026 124.164000 127.746875 right yeah but uh
