sw2990B-ms98-a-0049 162.010000 167.072250 [silence]
sw2990B-ms98-a-0050 167.072250 175.459000 yeah well see i the the reason i said my taste is probably different is i have always liked country music and my husband has always been just total rock
sw2990B-ms98-a-0051 175.459000 189.667250 and so uh we never could agree on what we were going to listen to after we got married because_1 i'd want to l[isten]- hear country and he'd want to hear rock and we couldn't get along because_1 his rock was too rock for me i like soft rock but i don't like some of the heavy metal stuff he was listening to
sw2990B-ms98-a-0052 189.667250 190.723500 and um
sw2990B-ms98-a-0053 190.723500 203.764125 so both of us were real strong members of a church and uh we decided we start listening to contemporary Christian music so we started listening to one of the stations around here that we both really like it plays just Christian music all the time
sw2990B-ms98-a-0054 203.764125 215.712875 and we've gotten now where that's pretty much all we listen to and uh there're some really really talented artists that's you know song writers and singers that uh do just Christian music
sw2990B-ms98-a-0055 215.712875 226.266750 so of course you know Amy Grant and people like that are pretty well known there's a guy named [noise] Bruce Carroll and he's my favorite because_1 he has a country sound but it's Christian lyrics
sw2990B-ms98-a-0056 226.266750 240.857625 and he's a wonderful song writer he won a an an is it Emmy or what does it Grammy it's the Grammy awards they give for music yeah he won a Grammy for inspirational song of the year last year so
sw2990B-ms98-a-0057 240.857625 245.218125 [silence]

sw2990B-ms98-a-0064 255.959500 266.291875 oh Sandy Patty and yeah well that's pretty neat well see i'm excited that kids these days are liking decent music and uh
sw2990B-ms98-a-0065 266.291875 277.340500 i mean all the songs of of course on on this station have real good good lyrics and good ideas [laughter-and] that kind of thing so i really encourage my daughter to listen to that and she right now she loves it i don't know
sw2990B-ms98-a-0066 277.340500 280.981750 if it'll stick with her she's still young in elementary school so
sw2990B-ms98-a-0067 280.981750 282.557625 [silence]
sw2990B-ms98-a-0068 282.557625 293.790875 yeah well that's that's good that she still chooses that but you know i like the country sound there are se[veral]- i li[ke]- i like Willie Nelson i always like Don Williams my dad thought i was crazy but
sw2990B-ms98-a-0069 293.790875 305.198625 he's always been one of my favorites and um then my husband on the other hand he i guess when he was like in his early twenties really got into the heavy metal kind of stuff before we got married and
sw2990B-ms98-a-0070 305.198625 310.641250 so then he'd want to play that stuff and i was like oh that's giving me a headache [laughter]
sw2990B-ms98-a-0071 310.641250 312.644250 [silence]

sw2990B-ms98-a-0082 330.030000 341.779125 yeah yeah well i still whenever they um have these advertisements on TV for um records that have like all the songs from the seventies i was i was in high school like from the early seventies and uh
sw2990B-ms98-a-0083 341.779125 353.071250 so all that music brings back a lot of memories you know and i'm always thinking oh i'd like to have one of those albums but since we made this agreement that we're going to listen to Christian music i think oh well i'll probably set it on the shelf and [laughter] would never you know play it
sw2990B-ms98-a-0084 353.071250 354.411875 [silence]
sw2990B-ms98-a-0085 354.411875 359.852875 yeah [laughter] that's right we buy things that we know the whole family can listen to

sw2990B-ms98-a-0096 392.325375 402.392500 that's right and and i think my personal opinion is they're missing out on a lot and i love um this you know that KLTY that's what i listen to all the time and i
sw2990B-ms98-a-0097 402.392500 412.510750 i love all the music that they play on there but i have a lot of people that go to church with me that kind of criticize that and think that uh it's wrong and all this so uh i[t]-
sw2990B-ms98-a-0098 412.510750 416.658000 [silence]
sw2990B-ms98-a-0099 416.658000 418.337500 yeah

sw2990B-ms98-a-0102 422.304250 435.162000 well i told my husband the one thing i like about it is uh you know you kind of think about whatever you listen to i mean you just you may not realize you're doing it but you do and uh when i listen to Christian music then i'm lis[tening]- i'm thinking about something good you know and
sw2990B-ms98-a-0103 435.162000 449.878125 i'll be washing dishes or something and i'll think about a song and it'll bring back you know some ideas and so to me it's just a good influence but there's still a whole lot of other music i you know really enjoy listening to my husband and i both kind of really got into REO S[peedwagon]-
