sw2984A-ms98-a-0019 87.738875 96.118625 well no i had a lawn service one year and i thought phooey i'm going to do it myself because i figured up the cost and i said huh-uh i can do it much
sw2984A-ms98-a-0020 96.118625 110.058250 cheaper and better and so what i did i switched to a liquid and i do it with an applicator with my hose and it's so much easier than taking that lawn spreader and walking all over the territory i was surprised how easy it was
sw2984A-ms98-a-0021 110.058250 113.770250 and i[t]- i thought well i'm going to do this all the time
sw2984A-ms98-a-0022 113.770250 124.795500 so i found you know and i've got some problems with uh two trees in my front yard and i took them to a certified uh nurseryman the other day and do you know what he told me i he needed to do
sw2984A-ms98-a-0023 124.795500 129.876000 which is at [laughter] [laughter-it's] [laughter-just] [laughter-unreal] he said i needed to pull every leave off
sw2984A-ms98-a-0024 129.876000 134.726625 the tree and the tree is fifteen feet high and it probably has about ten thousand leaves on it
sw2984A-ms98-a-0025 134.726625 139.422250 and he told me i needed to pull every leaf off and then spray it with this chemical that he
sw2984A-ms98-a-0026 139.422250 146.244375 said i should purchase and i thought uh-oh [laughter] this is this is unreal this is unreal
sw2984A-ms98-a-0027 146.244375 151.644875 so uh i think i'll get my son-in-law [laughter-to] [laughter-do] [laughter-it] [laughter-for] [laughter-me] [laughter-if] [laughter-he] [laughter-will] but
sw2984A-ms98-a-0028 151.644875 153.329250 [silence]
sw2984A-ms98-a-0029 153.329250 158.366375 yes it's a disease that it's got and i don't know what happened to it uh and then it
sw2984A-ms98-a-0030 158.366375 160.374000 it um w[ell]-
sw2984A-ms98-a-0031 160.374000 164.078750 well one is a maple one is um
sw2984A-ms98-a-0032 164.078750 169.990125 a maple but i would much prefer i think it's not a native Texan tree
sw2984A-ms98-a-0033 169.990125 180.770375 and uh the one that the ones that really do well are the ones that are on the city property and they don't get any care and they're Cedar Elm and they're just beautiful
sw2984A-ms98-a-0034 180.770375 184.737875 so i mean it it's you know these things that you pamper
sw2984A-ms98-a-0035 184.737875 190.393500 some people have really a green thumb and you know and um although i don't have
sw2984A-ms98-a-0036 190.393500 201.732250 too serious a problem but i don't know if it was from the the the late freezes that were or the early freezes we had that caused this tree damage and you know Sperry said you know that's what happened to the Crepe Myrtles
sw2984A-ms98-a-0037 201.732250 208.243250 the last two years that you we are looking at all of the freeze damage from the prior two years
sw2984A-ms98-a-0038 208.243250 213.749125 so i kind of think that maybe that uh happened to these large trees that i have
sw2984A-ms98-a-0039 213.749125 217.165500 and i really hate to lose them_1 but um
sw2984A-ms98-a-0040 217.165500 223.496625 that's one of the hazards i guess of uh having a a yard because i
