sw2924A-ms98-a-0003 0.589875 3.016375 so what do you think of our trial system
sw2924A-ms98-a-0004 3.016375 13.672125 [silence]
sw2924A-ms98-a-0005 13.672125 15.011875 yeah
sw2924A-ms98-a-0006 15.011875 17.257375 yeah i have noticed that that that
sw2924A-ms98-a-0007 17.257375 20.171875 that kind of stuff does seem to happen quite a bit um
sw2924A-ms98-a-0008 20.171875 24.959500 yeah i don't i don't i don't even know what to do about that sort of thing
sw2924A-ms98-a-0009 24.959500 28.473625 [silence]
sw2924A-ms98-a-0010 28.473625 34.944375 yeah i think trial by jury is very good i actually they said i think the tape said something about changing uh
sw2924A-ms98-a-0011 34.944375 40.888500 changing it such that that or leaving sentencing up to the judge only i think that's actually good idea
sw2924A-ms98-a-0012 40.888500 44.338750 well just just sentencing not the trial itself
sw2924A-ms98-a-0013 44.338750 50.706250 um because i think that th[at]- that that judges are probably more informed as to what is
sw2924A-ms98-a-0014 50.706250 54.169625 how serious the nature of the crime is and stuff like that an[d]-
sw2924A-ms98-a-0015 54.169625 59.279000 [silence]
sw2924A-ms98-a-0016 59.279000 60.205125 right
sw2924A-ms98-a-0017 60.205125 62.168750 [silence]
sw2924A-ms98-a-0018 62.168750 66.024750 right so he'll be able to give them the maximum sentence in some cases there
sw2924A-ms98-a-0019 66.024750 69.149375 [silence]
sw2924A-ms98-a-0020 69.149375 72.991375 oh yeah the[y]- the[y]- they give that as as an example of something that
sw2924A-ms98-a-0021 72.991375 74.580500 that might happen
sw2924A-ms98-a-0022 74.580500 82.089125 [silence]
sw2924A-ms98-a-0023 82.089125 83.887250 oh yes
sw2924A-ms98-a-0024 83.887250 88.772250 [silence]
sw2924A-ms98-a-0025 88.772250 90.296625 right right
sw2924A-ms98-a-0026 90.296625 94.408250 or just you know there are two people who say well he just looks guilty um
sw2924A-ms98-a-0027 94.408250 98.569125 that's actually that's a wonderful way to get off jury duty you know
sw2924A-ms98-a-0028 98.569125 107.056750 someone says to you you know when they ask you if you uh if you want to be on you know when you're c[alled]- called for duty say oh yeah i want to be on jury duty because i can spot a guilty person a mile a way
sw2924A-ms98-a-0029 107.056750 109.754750 they quickly let you off jury duty i hear um
sw2924A-ms98-a-0030 109.754750 112.783875 [silence]
sw2924A-ms98-a-0031 112.783875 122.536875 oh yeah that that that that that's that's the way it works there um anyway i think that probably for for having it what about you know about being unanimous
sw2924A-ms98-a-0032 122.536875 134.930000 i mean that's sort of a strange case because_1 i wonder what happens when eleven people thinks someone's guilty and one person doesn't one person thinks that that they're not guilty and they can't decide for hours unless they convince that one person you know
sw2924A-ms98-a-0033 134.930000 137.951750 i believe it does have to be unanimous actually
sw2924A-ms98-a-0034 137.951750 143.016750 [silence]
sw2924A-ms98-a-0035 143.016750 150.161250 yeah i think they either have a retrial eventually or or they call it a mistrial or something i haven't been to law school so
sw2924A-ms98-a-0036 150.161250 162.018375 so i don't know much about that i just know that um i wonder because_1 sometimes i think about it actually i think well what if i were that one person and i was completely convinced that that that that this person wasn't guilty you know
sw2924A-ms98-a-0037 162.018375 165.945375 [silence]
sw2924A-ms98-a-0038 165.945375 172.387625 right uh but i mean what if eleven other people are saying one thing you know and you're you're the one person saying the other thing
sw2924A-ms98-a-0039 172.387625 174.108125 you know would you give in
sw2924A-ms98-a-0040 174.108125 179.238250 [silence]
sw2924A-ms98-a-0041 179.238250 181.168500 yeah saying

sw2924A-ms98-a-0043 183.817750 185.161875 yeah
sw2924A-ms98-a-0044 185.161875 186.131000 yeah
sw2924A-ms98-a-0045 186.131000 196.920250 i wonder about those things you know or even if it's you know i i- guess if they were to say well it doesn't have to be unanimous what's the cut off number seven five you know six six you know how do you decide
sw2924A-ms98-a-0046 196.920250 200.852000 is it you know how do you decide what number of people have to say that
sw2924A-ms98-a-0047 200.852000 203.558250 [silence]
sw2924A-ms98-a-0048 203.558250 205.455000 [laughter]

sw2924A-ms98-a-0054 233.561500 236.574875 yeah i've never quite understood that um

sw2924A-ms98-a-0056 240.752750 242.363875 [laughter-okay]

sw2924A-ms98-a-0058 262.043625 264.040750 right and they can't do anything about it
sw2924A-ms98-a-0059 264.040750 266.508625 yeah i often wonder about that i wonder if
sw2924A-ms98-a-0060 266.508625 267.546625 [silence]
sw2924A-ms98-a-0061 267.546625 275.240500 if maybe you know i- i- i don't i don't i don't know the law on that but if they have new evidence can they can they tr[y]- retry or can they you know bring you back
sw2924A-ms98-a-0062 275.240500 277.180375 [silence]
sw2924A-ms98-a-0063 277.180375 280.452250 oh actually that's true i've seen the same thing on LA Law as well
sw2924A-ms98-a-0064 280.452250 281.730875 [silence]
sw2924A-ms98-a-0065 281.730875 289.839500 yeah w[ell]- so i wond[er]- and then i wonder why that you know there there must be some sort of deep seeded reason for that you you know something like
sw2924A-ms98-a-0066 289.839500 296.750000 something like well you can't be tried for the same trial because that would bias the the the the the the jury or something or you know
sw2924A-ms98-a-0067 296.750000 298.233625 [silence]
sw2924A-ms98-a-0068 298.233625 299.588875 yeah
sw2924A-ms98-a-0069 299.588875 311.917875 [silence]
sw2924A-ms98-a-0070 311.917875 314.952125 in in of the defense in advance
sw2924A-ms98-a-0071 314.952125 319.553250 yeah well well there's also the issue of for instance you can't um
sw2924A-ms98-a-0072 319.553250 323.266250 you can't uh very often you can't um
sw2924A-ms98-a-0073 323.266250 328.004375 when someone is is on trial for something you can't bring up prior convictions
sw2924A-ms98-a-0074 328.004375 329.548000 which
sw2924A-ms98-a-0075 329.548000 333.759750 [silence]
sw2924A-ms98-a-0076 333.759750 336.822375 right that's completely beyond me i mean that's jus[t]-
sw2924A-ms98-a-0077 336.822375 338.409250 i wonder y[eah]-
sw2924A-ms98-a-0078 338.409250 341.016125 [silence]
sw2924A-ms98-a-0079 341.016125 349.106875 yeah i mean if this man is is is accused of raping someone then i think that something like sex you know the fact that he se[xually]- sexually assaulted someone is a crucial bit of evidence
sw2924A-ms98-a-0080 349.106875 351.777125 that adds to the fact and i- i- i
sw2924A-ms98-a-0081 351.777125 362.660000 i- i often i never understand you know having again having i'm sure there are some deep seated reasons you know to i mean often times i wonder about rules like this and i'm sure that that that there are some reasons
sw2924A-ms98-a-0082 362.660000 363.780875 for good
sw2924A-ms98-a-0083 363.780875 371.502500 [silence]
sw2924A-ms98-a-0084 371.502500 372.765750 right

sw2924A-ms98-a-0086 378.847000 380.788375 then right then then

sw2924A-ms98-a-0088 382.342000 386.033500 then they should be closed yeah i mean that's what i think but i don't um
sw2924A-ms98-a-0089 386.033500 388.288250 but i don't quite understand
sw2924A-ms98-a-0090 388.288250 392.037375 [silence]
sw2924A-ms98-a-0091 392.037375 393.638500 do i vote
sw2924A-ms98-a-0092 393.638500 395.219250 oh yeah i vote yes
sw2924A-ms98-a-0093 395.219250 397.933875 [silence]

sw2924A-ms98-a-0098 410.272000 420.236000 well that's that's that that's very true but then again oft[en]- often times they don't as well often times they don't uh they just go you know they're you've got people like who are uh
sw2924A-ms98-a-0099 420.236000 426.959125 who are you know lame lame ducks and they sort of don't care about anything and just want to go ahead and
sw2924A-ms98-a-0100 426.959125 437.258875 [silence]
sw2924A-ms98-a-0101 437.258875 448.157625 that's true that's true i often i mean that that like you say that's another discussion but i have had that discussion before as well where you weren't i- i wonder about the po[litics]- politics of it all so
sw2924A-ms98-a-0102 448.157625 449.647125 [silence]
sw2924A-ms98-a-0103 449.647125 450.878250 yeah
sw2924A-ms98-a-0104 450.878250 453.332500 well even in the courts you well well they're all appointed
sw2924A-ms98-a-0105 453.332500 464.879500 i mean that's even a[nother]- another issue you know should should should judges be appointed you know and or or um often times i look at friends we had uh a serial killer around here who killed eleven women
sw2924A-ms98-a-0106 464.879500 471.559875 [silence]
sw2924A-ms98-a-0107 471.559875 475.553125 ch[oking]- oh and and choking them yeah uh his name is Arthur Shotcross
sw2924A-ms98-a-0108 475.553125 477.017750 [silence]
sw2924A-ms98-a-0109 477.017750 483.468000 i'm not sure if they had one yet but i'm sure they will um because he was he was on some sort of news special though he was
sw2924A-ms98-a-0110 483.468000 484.961625 he was uh
sw2924A-ms98-a-0111 484.961625 487.838375 he killed because_1 he was just on trial like maybe a year ago
sw2924A-ms98-a-0112 487.838375 488.897875 [silence]
sw2924A-ms98-a-0113 488.897875 491.492500 um he was strangling some of them
sw2924A-ms98-a-0114 491.492500 492.976750 [silence]
sw2924A-ms98-a-0115 492.976750 495.855375 oh no usually they were prostitutes actually
sw2924A-ms98-a-0116 495.855375 502.891625 because_1 he was he was actually this is a very sad case the man was let out he was in prison for um sexually assaulting two children
sw2924A-ms98-a-0117 502.891625 505.421250 [silence]
sw2924A-ms98-a-0118 505.421250 518.417125 right he he they let him out and then and then he wa[sn't]- he wasn't allowed back in the town where he had done this so he came to our he came to Rochester instead and they they they realized later he he'd killed about between eleven and twelve women at least
sw2924A-ms98-a-0119 518.417125 519.689875 and
sw2924A-ms98-a-0120 519.689875 520.962625 [silence]
sw2924A-ms98-a-0121 520.962625 523.428875 oh really way up north here huh
sw2924A-ms98-a-0122 523.428875 525.999000 [silence]
sw2924A-ms98-a-0123 525.999000 529.376875 oh okay still way up north sort of um
sw2924A-ms98-a-0124 529.376875 531.015250 [laughter]
sw2924A-ms98-a-0125 531.015250 536.106375 [silence]
sw2924A-ms98-a-0126 536.106375 537.673875 yeah
sw2924A-ms98-a-0127 537.673875 538.971625 [silence]
sw2924A-ms98-a-0128 538.971625 543.402500 won't get out exactly yeah th[is]- this this man was sentenced to i think like three life times
sw2924A-ms98-a-0129 543.402500 546.329625 but he was you know it was just horrible because um
sw2924A-ms98-a-0130 546.329625 553.997750 his his his trial was you know was it wa[s]- it was televised and this and that and what they were pleading was um they were pleading insanity
sw2924A-ms98-a-0131 553.997750 559.121750 i mean it's clear to me the man is insane and should just be locked up for life
sw2924A-ms98-a-0132 559.121750 567.678750 right i mean i don't know what you do with them at that point if you're that crazy but what what struck me is you know they had a psychiatrist testifying for hours and hours
sw2924A-ms98-a-0133 567.678750 571.668750 and by the end i realized that you know maybe it would have been better if they had
sw2924A-ms98-a-0134 571.668750 576.276125 it wouldn't have been a jury of his peers but if they had a jury of psychiatrists instead
sw2924A-ms98-a-0135 576.276125 582.013125 to sort look at it you know i mean i don't think it's feasible but it would be an interesting thought if you're
sw2924A-ms98-a-0136 582.013125 586.217875 [silence]
sw2924A-ms98-a-0137 586.217875 595.487875 no or right [vocalized-noise] right exactly but give them a bunch of psychotics but at least have a have a have a bunch of psychiatrists you know just sort of look at him and decide from then i mean there was the issue of 
sw2924A-ms98-a-0138 595.487875 597.442000 what's that yeah they did
sw2924A-ms98-a-0139 597.442000 599.722250 they had a regular trial by jury for him and and
