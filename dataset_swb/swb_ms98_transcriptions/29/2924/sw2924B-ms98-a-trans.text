sw2924B-ms98-a-0012 23.988250 28.873000 but i think trial by jury is it's a lot better than leaving it up to one person
sw2924B-ms98-a-0013 28.873000 36.495375 [silence]
sw2924B-ms98-a-0014 36.495375 37.380625 so it

sw2924B-ms98-a-0027 73.949375 76.344750 but i think if
sw2924B-ms98-a-0028 76.344750 84.752625 the entire trial was left to one person [laughter] i've got a four year old that you can hear but um

sw2924B-ms98-a-0037 133.934625 137.145000 does it have to be unanimous
sw2924B-ms98-a-0038 137.145000 140.959750 well then they consider it a hung jury i g[uess]- i think and then they uh
sw2924B-ms98-a-0039 140.959750 143.512000 have a retrial or do they
sw2924B-ms98-a-0040 143.512000 147.400250 [silence]

sw2924B-ms98-a-0050 176.843625 180.019125 you know bombarded by all the other eleven jurors
sw2924B-ms98-a-0051 180.019125 184.813125 to you know just say he's guilty so we can get out of here and go home
sw2924B-ms98-a-0052 184.813125 186.185625 yeah

sw2924B-ms98-a-0059 208.796125 212.538500 so i just hope if i ever go to court that they all
sw2924B-ms98-a-0060 212.538500 222.235500 unanimous on not guilty [laughter] well you've seen like these TV movies <b_aside> Kyle i'm talking hush <e_aside> but uh

sw2924B-ms98-a-0062 234.196125 236.196625 [silence]
sw2924B-ms98-a-0063 236.196625 248.279375 well i just think it's it's weird because i've saw well of course soap operas i'm an soap opera fanatic this one guy had uh framed himself to make it wh[ere]- which he really did kill the person but then he
sw2924B-ms98-a-0064 248.279375 263.221125 set it up where it looked like somebody was trying to frame him and he was on trial for it and then you know it came out that he was being framed so then he was found not guilty and then jus[t]- directly after the trial they found out he really was guilty and he couldn't be tried again
sw2924B-ms98-a-0065 263.221125 265.228875 yeah bec[ause]-

sw2924B-ms98-a-0073 298.409250 302.625375 uh after the uh defendant defending
sw2924B-ms98-a-0074 302.625375 314.172375 oh the defendant's lawyer and the prosecuting attorney i'm sure the prosecuting attorney could make a real good case if he you know knew all the details of the defendant's you know case
