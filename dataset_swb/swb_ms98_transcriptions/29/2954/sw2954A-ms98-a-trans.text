sw2954A-ms98-a-0016 40.355875 47.942750 yeah that would be hard for us because most of the family is out in California and some is in New York and North Carolina and it gets
sw2954A-ms98-a-0017 47.942750 50.466625 kind of hard to get ev[erybody]- get everybody organized

sw2954A-ms98-a-0051 152.242375 156.731000 New Year's Day so it was almost a celebration of the new year too at the same time
sw2954A-ms98-a-0052 156.731000 158.553375 that was kind of fun
sw2954A-ms98-a-0053 158.553375 160.358125 but um
sw2954A-ms98-a-0054 160.358125 169.406000 who was it a friend of mine had a big family reunion a couple of years ago and you know everybody flew in from all over the place for the weekend and it really sounded like it was fun
sw2954A-ms98-a-0055 169.406000 170.899375 but
sw2954A-ms98-a-0056 170.899375 174.060750 i am not quite sure what i would do i think it'd be fun to like rent a big
sw2954A-ms98-a-0057 174.060750 176.326125 mansion or house someplace
sw2954A-ms98-a-0058 176.326125 179.886375 and have everybody meet someplace where they do not really know
sw2954A-ms98-a-0059 179.886375 184.233375 and have different areas to explore and things like that so that'd be kind of fun
sw2954A-ms98-a-0060 184.233375 185.291625 [silence]
sw2954A-ms98-a-0061 185.291625 186.143500 yep
sw2954A-ms98-a-0062 186.143500 188.262125 where [laughter-nobody] lives
sw2954A-ms98-a-0063 188.262125 193.564250 but at least that way it is at nobody's house so nobody one no one person is responsible for everything
sw2954A-ms98-a-0064 193.564250 194.627875 [silence]
sw2954A-ms98-a-0065 194.627875 195.693375 yep
sw2954A-ms98-a-0066 195.693375 198.109250 that's for sure the cleaning up can be a mess
sw2954A-ms98-a-0067 198.109250 199.110000 [silence]
sw2954A-ms98-a-0068 199.110000 202.629750 but um do you have horses or anything at your dad's farm

sw2954A-ms98-a-0073 216.576000 223.152750 i see so it's so he really does use it as a vacation home it is not like a farm that he has somebody else run for him or something like that
sw2954A-ms98-a-0074 223.152750 225.572375 [silence]
sw2954A-ms98-a-0075 225.572375 227.009250 um-hum

sw2954A-ms98-a-0082 244.926000 246.783375 so it wasn't so worth it

sw2954A-ms98-a-0090 259.843000 264.847500 i do not know how they do scale down there you know here it would be a [laughter-huge] amount of [laughter-land]
sw2954A-ms98-a-0091 264.847500 265.408000 [silence]
sw2954A-ms98-a-0092 265.408000 270.343000 yeah because_1 the person's house here that has a lot of space is three or four acres as opposed to
sw2954A-ms98-a-0093 270.343000 271.464500 [silence]
sw2954A-ms98-a-0094 271.464500 273.056500 tens of acres

sw2954A-ms98-a-0102 304.480000 309.139375 yeah i think my dad put some we have a little pond at ours at his vacation home too
sw2954A-ms98-a-0103 309.139375 318.895125 and y[eah]- i mean really little and they were having problems with too many goldfish because_1 we had put some goldfish in and there were too many little goldfish and so the big ones never got bigger
sw2954A-ms98-a-0104 318.895125 322.196750 and uh somebody suggested to get a bass
sw2954A-ms98-a-0105 322.196750 329.403750 and so they went fishing and caught a bass near some place and put it in there and never saw it [laughter-again]
sw2954A-ms98-a-0106 329.403750 332.727000 no so we do not know if it is living or
sw2954A-ms98-a-0107 332.727000 334.609000 [silence]
sw2954A-ms98-a-0108 334.609000 335.948875 yep [laughter]
sw2954A-ms98-a-0109 335.948875 339.981250 we still have lots of little goldfish they propagate pretty well those little fish
sw2954A-ms98-a-0110 339.981250 340.792000 this
sw2954A-ms98-a-0111 340.792000 348.785125 yeah because_1 we started we have got hundreds in there now and we started with i think ten or twenty little feeder fish that i picked up for a dollar you know ma[ny]- no matter how many it was for a dollar
sw2954A-ms98-a-0112 348.785125 349.755625 and
sw2954A-ms98-a-0113 349.755625 350.779500 [silence]
sw2954A-ms98-a-0114 350.779500 352.353500 and some of them_1 are probably
sw2954A-ms98-a-0115 352.353500 356.979750 eight inches long but he wants your really big ones you know the ones that get to be like a foot and a half long
sw2954A-ms98-a-0116 356.979750 358.392625 and
sw2954A-ms98-a-0117 358.392625 359.376250 it
sw2954A-ms98-a-0118 359.376250 376.299500 [silence]
sw2954A-ms98-a-0119 376.299500 378.297750 oh okay
sw2954A-ms98-a-0120 378.297750 388.174625 well we we'd want to put some small ones in so they do not eat the big [laughter-guys] the goldfish too [laughter] but yeah we could see i do not know if yellow catfish live up this way but catfish do i think
sw2954A-ms98-a-0121 388.174625 391.192500 [silence]
sw2954A-ms98-a-0122 391.192500 392.371000 um-hum

sw2954A-ms98-a-0124 394.032250 396.982750 so that you me[an]- well we could try it that is a good idea
sw2954A-ms98-a-0125 396.982750 400.922125 he's he was trying to catch them_1 you know using little uh 
sw2954A-ms98-a-0126 400.922125 402.088000 [silence]
sw2954A-ms98-a-0127 402.088000 414.586375 i forget there's little uh nets you can use to catch fish to use as feeder fish and things like that minnow nets or something my father was taking those and trying to catch the goldfish and it was really funny because uh
sw2954A-ms98-a-0128 414.586375 421.464750 one time he left the net in the pond and he like would put some tuna fish or things in the middle of it to attract the fish
sw2954A-ms98-a-0129 421.464750 429.297250 and uh he left it in the middle of the pond and that night he came out and the trap was gone and it was a raccoon that had taken it
sw2954A-ms98-a-0130 429.297250 435.482875 so it was really funny and you could see that you know you could see where the trap the trap was dragged and things like that
sw2954A-ms98-a-0131 435.482875 436.584125 and so
sw2954A-ms98-a-0132 436.584125 438.528750 [silence]
