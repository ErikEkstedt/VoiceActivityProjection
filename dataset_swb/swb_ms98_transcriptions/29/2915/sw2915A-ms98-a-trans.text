sw2915A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 5.899125 well i think we pay too much in taxes [laughter] how about_1 you

sw2915A-ms98-a-0003 7.558250 9.134625 excuse me
sw2915A-ms98-a-0004 9.134625 11.604750 [silence]
sw2915A-ms98-a-0005 11.604750 23.830750 yeah that's what i think too i don't know how you feel um we moved here from another state we've lived here before went out and came back and that particular state had an occupational income tax but no sales tax
sw2915A-ms98-a-0006 23.830750 34.189875 and what you find out is there's one evil's the same as the other here you don't there's no occupational tax but it's a heavy sales tax so they get you coming and going
sw2915A-ms98-a-0007 34.189875 36.343250 [silence]
sw2915A-ms98-a-0008 36.343250 39.932125 yeah its really i know it's just um
sw2915A-ms98-a-0009 39.932125 49.124250 yeah it is i was shocked i went we bought a new washer and the man said and that's eight percent i said eight percent [laughter-what] so it's really kind of sad yeah
sw2915A-ms98-a-0010 49.124250 57.820750 and then i don't know how you know in terms of when you all do your federal but it just seems like if you're strictly middle income it seems like you get hit the worst
sw2915A-ms98-a-0011 57.820750 59.461750 [silence]
sw2915A-ms98-a-0012 59.461750 61.337250 is that what you think
sw2915A-ms98-a-0013 61.337250 68.233500 [silence]
sw2915A-ms98-a-0014 68.233500 69.666500 um-hum
sw2915A-ms98-a-0015 69.666500 73.120375 [silence]
sw2915A-ms98-a-0016 73.120375 80.732125 doesn't seem quite fair does it because_1 they have the money to shelter things and i don't know somehow get a huh
sw2915A-ms98-a-0017 80.732125 88.416625 oh i thought you were going to say something they somehow seem to get around the the things that we can't you know that make don't make that kind of money
sw2915A-ms98-a-0018 88.416625 90.225000 i don't know
sw2915A-ms98-a-0019 90.225000 94.762875 [silence]
sw2915A-ms98-a-0020 94.762875 103.705000 um-hum i know and just somehow it doesn't seem you know a[nd]- and they're no[t]- you mean you look at somebody like uh that country singer uh what's his name Willie Nelson
sw2915A-ms98-a-0021 103.705000 111.437375 i was reading about him in the paper and i said well you know he knew he was making money someb[ody]- he didn't look that stupid why didn't he pay his taxes you know
sw2915A-ms98-a-0022 111.437375 120.019750 in a way it's almost like he had so much debt that uh filing bankruptcy was a way to get out of all of it you know so
sw2915A-ms98-a-0023 120.019750 124.007625 do you file federal or a joint income tax or do you
sw2915A-ms98-a-0024 124.007625 126.663125 [silence]
sw2915A-ms98-a-0025 126.663125 130.310000 and do you feel like you get hit by you know too much
sw2915A-ms98-a-0026 130.310000 139.275250 [silence]
sw2915A-ms98-a-0027 139.275250 152.153375 um-hum and we right now we don't own any property we lease so we're in the sa[me]- we don't have children so we're in the same kind of it's not as bad as being single and divorced but it's sort of like if you have like X point five children and own you know
sw2915A-ms98-a-0028 152.153375 165.648500 you kind of get hit with you know i i mean it doesn't even pay for me to earn a good wage because and that sounds stupid but i mean there's actually less tax implication if i don't work full time compared to what my husband does you know
sw2915A-ms98-a-0029 165.648500 167.555875 so it's kind of hard
sw2915A-ms98-a-0030 167.555875 170.196250 [silence]
sw2915A-ms98-a-0031 170.196250 171.509000 excuse me
