sw2981A-ms98-a-0003 4.666875 9.041625 well Cathy i think that uh capital punishment certainly
sw2981A-ms98-a-0004 9.041625 11.925750 h[as]- has a place in our society
sw2981A-ms98-a-0005 11.925750 14.938375 um
sw2981A-ms98-a-0006 14.938375 17.824125 maybe from the sense that
sw2981A-ms98-a-0007 17.824125 20.084125 there are some things that
sw2981A-ms98-a-0008 20.084125 25.892375 we just can't afford to have repeated uh e[ven]- even in the remote chance of repetition
sw2981A-ms98-a-0009 25.892375 49.773375 [silence]
sw2981A-ms98-a-0010 49.773375 52.499500 that might be true um
sw2981A-ms98-a-0011 52.499500 57.199500 um what i don't know is where do we draw the line
sw2981A-ms98-a-0012 57.199500 59.822000 uh do we say that
sw2981A-ms98-a-0013 59.822000 68.019625 everyone who commits murder in the first degree is liable for capital punishment if that's what the
sw2981A-ms98-a-0014 68.019625 72.633250 jury decides is an appropriate punishment for their crime
sw2981A-ms98-a-0015 72.633250 75.405500 uh or do we extend it
sw2981A-ms98-a-0016 75.405500 77.395500 uh beyond that
sw2981A-ms98-a-0017 77.395500 81.411250 [silence]
sw2981A-ms98-a-0018 81.411250 83.840625 well either you know
sw2981A-ms98-a-0019 83.840625 85.333625 [silence]
sw2981A-ms98-a-0020 85.333625 95.226000 uh i have a a nine year old daughter and there are some crimes that could be committed against her that are not even considered capital crimes that
sw2981A-ms98-a-0021 95.226000 98.581000 that i would consider basis for murder
sw2981A-ms98-a-0022 98.581000 124.540000 [silence]
sw2981A-ms98-a-0023 124.540000 128.622000 yes it does uh a lot of that has to do with
sw2981A-ms98-a-0024 128.622000 129.775125 [silence]
sw2981A-ms98-a-0025 129.775125 136.657500 the cultures that we grew up in and what's termed acceptable and and uh
sw2981A-ms98-a-0026 136.657500 140.094875 to what's allowable and and where are we
sw2981A-ms98-a-0027 140.094875 141.672125 uh
sw2981A-ms98-a-0028 141.672125 148.002625 you know if we were lived in a different country then murder is not so bad
sw2981A-ms98-a-0029 148.002625 151.386250 [silence]
sw2981A-ms98-a-0030 151.386250 153.998875 but over here where we're
sw2981A-ms98-a-0031 153.998875 156.396250 promised the
sw2981A-ms98-a-0032 156.396250 163.111000 civil liberties of purs[uit]- life liberty and pursuit of happiness then taking that away
sw2981A-ms98-a-0033 163.111000 167.298250 is a a heinous act
sw2981A-ms98-a-0034 167.298250 190.250750 [silence]
sw2981A-ms98-a-0035 190.250750 194.534500 i don't know i believe it's uh at the discretion of the
sw2981A-ms98-a-0036 194.534500 197.077750 judge or or jury
sw2981A-ms98-a-0037 197.077750 220.358875 [silence]
sw2981A-ms98-a-0038 220.358875 222.776625 i tend to agree with you there
sw2981A-ms98-a-0039 222.776625 223.940750 [silence]
sw2981A-ms98-a-0040 223.940750 225.473625 um
sw2981A-ms98-a-0041 225.473625 227.652375 [silence]
sw2981A-ms98-a-0042 227.652375 229.928625 my belief is that
sw2981A-ms98-a-0043 229.928625 234.252875 is that uh any crime that's
sw2981A-ms98-a-0044 234.252875 240.985250 freely committed you know freedom of choice the[se]- these people had a choice of committing this crime
sw2981A-ms98-a-0045 240.985250 248.942875 that involves the taking of another's life or the altering of someone's life
sw2981A-ms98-a-0046 248.942875 251.065250 such as rape
sw2981A-ms98-a-0047 251.065250 254.062250 deserves punishment by death
sw2981A-ms98-a-0048 254.062250 258.256625 but then i'm also told that i'm a pretty harsh person
sw2981A-ms98-a-0049 258.256625 288.377375 [silence]
sw2981A-ms98-a-0050 288.377375 289.976250 oh i
sw2981A-ms98-a-0051 289.976250 293.293000 i can see a difference between
sw2981A-ms98-a-0052 293.293000 294.849500 a
sw2981A-ms98-a-0053 294.849500 296.965000 [silence]
sw2981A-ms98-a-0054 296.965000 301.814125 person who goes out to rob a store
sw2981A-ms98-a-0055 301.814125 303.176250 [silence]
sw2981A-ms98-a-0056 303.176250 304.765500 for food
sw2981A-ms98-a-0057 304.765500 306.033875 [silence]
sw2981A-ms98-a-0058 306.033875 309.894625 than a person who
sw2981A-ms98-a-0059 309.894625 313.049000 commits a crime to
sw2981A-ms98-a-0060 313.049000 321.344125 uh either for the thrill of committing the crime or the thrill the feeling of power that they get from it or to 
sw2981A-ms98-a-0061 321.344125 327.762375 acquire drugs for some other i mean acquire funds for some other illegal activity
sw2981A-ms98-a-0062 327.762375 336.075750 you know that second group of people falls into the the group that i say give up their rights the the first guy
sw2981A-ms98-a-0063 336.075750 342.619125 i you know i just assumed that it was a guy the first person that that went out to rob a store for food
sw2981A-ms98-a-0064 342.619125 348.017000 that to me is is a different set of circumstances where he
sw2981A-ms98-a-0065 348.017000 349.205125 [silence]
sw2981A-ms98-a-0066 349.205125 352.532750 he deserves help instead of
sw2981A-ms98-a-0067 352.532750 354.939125 uh the loss of life
sw2981A-ms98-a-0068 354.939125 356.259750 [silence]
sw2981A-ms98-a-0069 356.259750 357.640125 [noise]
sw2981A-ms98-a-0070 357.640125 359.506625 [silence]
sw2981A-ms98-a-0071 359.506625 361.915875 that's right or with the
sw2981A-ms98-a-0072 361.915875 377.978625 [silence]
sw2981A-ms98-a-0073 377.978625 381.884875 i think i would probably lower the age to about fourteen
sw2981A-ms98-a-0074 381.884875 383.994750 [silence]
sw2981A-ms98-a-0075 383.994750 386.976375 there's some and and i
sw2981A-ms98-a-0076 386.976375 391.592625 certainly don't know myself but somebody needs to do a study
sw2981A-ms98-a-0077 391.592625 394.391875 that says at what age
sw2981A-ms98-a-0078 394.391875 399.741875 true and complete logical thought to include the the
sw2981A-ms98-a-0079 399.741875 401.981500 [silence]
sw2981A-ms98-a-0080 401.981500 405.626625 consideration of of long term consequences
sw2981A-ms98-a-0081 405.626625 407.728125 begins
sw2981A-ms98-a-0082 407.728125 413.719500 you know i i have an eighteen year old and uh i[t]- well he's nineteen now
sw2981A-ms98-a-0083 413.719500 419.405125 and i don't think that i saw it in him until maybe last year uh
sw2981A-ms98-a-0084 419.405125 428.642375 and i have an el[even]- and eleven year old and a nine year old and i don't don't see it in them yet but i'm i'm not sure where it begins
sw2981A-ms98-a-0085 428.642375 449.576625 [silence]
