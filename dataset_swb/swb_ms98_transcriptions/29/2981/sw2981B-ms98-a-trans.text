sw2981B-ms98-a-0002 0.046750 4.850625 okay well uh what's your opinion about capital punishment
sw2981B-ms98-a-0003 4.850625 27.239250 [silence]
sw2981B-ms98-a-0004 27.239250 41.361250 right i think i would agree with you on that too i i can't see any point in keeping someone who's obviously beyond any kind of rehabilitation uh keeping them_1 you know paying for them to live in prison for years and years and years
sw2981B-ms98-a-0005 41.361250 45.238750 when you could probably just eliminate the problem
sw2981B-ms98-a-0006 45.238750 48.868875 maybe spend the money on someone who could possibly be helped

sw2981B-ms98-a-0012 98.059000 99.861875 yeah
sw2981B-ms98-a-0013 99.861875 112.883625 yeah well that really gets int[o]- into a sticky issue uh i could see that too i think there's probably things i could think of short of murder that someone i think someone would probably deserve to be killed for
sw2981B-ms98-a-0014 112.883625 120.607500 but gosh a[nd]- and who's going to decide which is how bad you know something that to you is really bad might not be quite so bad to me and

sw2981B-ms98-a-0022 168.203625 176.352375 yeah in some eyes i think some people give up that [laughter] i think some of what we consider rights are really more privileges than
sw2981B-ms98-a-0023 176.352375 179.360250 think what most people think of them_1 as
sw2981B-ms98-a-0024 179.360250 190.758125 i don't know what um Texas's criteria for capital murder is do capital punishment is do you know are there some set guidelines like only under these circumstances
sw2981B-ms98-a-0025 190.758125 196.210125 [silence]
sw2981B-ms98-a-0026 196.210125 204.520875 uh-huh i used to live in Virginia and i know when they first reinstated capital punishment it was only um
sw2981B-ms98-a-0027 204.520875 213.495625 if someone killed a police officer or someone committed rape and then murder those were the only two circumstances where you could
sw2981B-ms98-a-0028 213.495625 218.798000 give someone the death penalty which i think is a little too limited
sw2981B-ms98-a-0029 218.798000 236.853000 [silence]

sw2981B-ms98-a-0035 258.699625 273.342000 [laughter] yeah in general terms i'm not so harsh but then whenever i hear of a specific case you know where someone did something then i[t's]- it's like yeah put it to [laughter-them_1] [laughter] so i i think i probably tend to be a little bit harsh too as far as that goes
sw2981B-ms98-a-0036 273.342000 282.837125 because yeah i think you're right that person voluntarily gives up when they decide to commit that crime they voluntarily give up their right
sw2981B-ms98-a-0037 282.837125 288.734625 to continue on with their happy life just becau[se]- you know they they ruin someone else's life
