sw2958A-ms98-a-0005 99.763250 105.380125 [silence]
sw2958A-ms98-a-0006 105.380125 110.744250 uh we uh just went through an experience um
sw2958A-ms98-a-0007 110.744250 115.333250 both my parents passed away fairly young and uh
sw2958A-ms98-a-0008 115.333250 123.457375 my wife's mother died when she was only nine years old so the only one that we really had was her father [noise] and uh
sw2958A-ms98-a-0009 123.457375 130.900000 [noise] uh he's no longer with us he passed away when he was uh he was going on eighty nine years old so he had a good long life 
sw2958A-ms98-a-0010 130.900000 141.167250 but he always maintained his own apartment he lived in the city he lived in uh Rhode Isla[nd]- in fact we live in Rhode Island i work in in the Massachusetts plant but i live in Rhode Island
sw2958A-ms98-a-0011 141.167250 146.003125 he's always lived in the in the city and he's always been kind of independent he's uh
sw2958A-ms98-a-0012 146.003125 153.884875 [noise] he's never had a a never owned an automobile never had a driver's license you know he's always you know yeah
sw2958A-ms98-a-0013 153.884875 159.338875 he got around yeah yeah because he lived right down down city in the in the 
sw2958A-ms98-a-0014 159.338875 165.227250 port authorities right there so he used to take the steamer down to New York and you know i mean he went
sw2958A-ms98-a-0015 165.227250 167.394375 yeah he went everywhere he wanted to go
sw2958A-ms98-a-0016 167.394375 168.974500 [silence]
sw2958A-ms98-a-0017 168.974500 176.532750 no and then uh about a year and a half ago he uh he started having mini strokes 
sw2958A-ms98-a-0018 176.532750 182.092625 [noise] and we got kind of concerned about him and then uh he had fallen in the street a couple of times but
sw2958A-ms98-a-0019 182.092625 183.594125 he uh
sw2958A-ms98-a-0020 183.594125 186.340000 he still didn't want to give up his apartment
sw2958A-ms98-a-0021 186.340000 188.062750 and uh
sw2958A-ms98-a-0022 188.062750 199.768250 finally a year ago last Thanksgiving um my wife tried to call him and he wouldn't answer the phone so we kind of expected the worse so i went down 
sw2958A-ms98-a-0023 199.768250 214.402875 and he had had another stroke and uh i found him he was just he was just standing in the middle of the room all covered with shaving cream he always trying to shave and uh he didn't know who i was uh so we brought him up to to uh stay with us 
sw2958A-ms98-a-0024 214.402875 217.745250 and uh he s[napped]- he snapped out of it
sw2958A-ms98-a-0025 217.745250 219.254375 he uh
sw2958A-ms98-a-0026 219.254375 221.916875 he was probably uh
sw2958A-ms98-a-0027 221.916875 225.956250 say ninety five percent himself
sw2958A-ms98-a-0028 225.956250 227.372375 [silence]
sw2958A-ms98-a-0029 227.372375 238.132750 and in in the course of the next [vocalized-noise] during the next year towards again it was getting on towards Thanksgiving time he started having you know more strokes and then uh 
sw2958A-ms98-a-0030 238.132750 243.171250 [noise] uh one morning he felt real dizzy so we took him to the hospital
sw2958A-ms98-a-0031 243.171250 247.277750 and while he was in the hospital he had a a massive stroke
sw2958A-ms98-a-0032 247.277750 249.445000 and it crippled him
sw2958A-ms98-a-0033 249.445000 252.457500 [noise] on one side his right side
sw2958A-ms98-a-0034 252.457500 259.330375 so he didn't have the use of of his arm or his leg or and then uh he lost the ability to speak
sw2958A-ms98-a-0035 259.330375 262.465375 and we're not sure but we think that he was
sw2958A-ms98-a-0036 262.465375 267.764250 very hard of hearing to begin with his almost his whole entire life
sw2958A-ms98-a-0037 267.764250 273.298500 so we figured that uh his hearing deteriorated even further and his eyesight
sw2958A-ms98-a-0038 273.298500 279.152375 um we did as as much as we could for him and then it got to the point where we couldn't handle him anymore 
sw2958A-ms98-a-0039 279.152375 283.502000 um i was working during the day and and uh [noise]
sw2958A-ms98-a-0040 283.502000 287.499375 uh my wife couldn't she she couldn't get him up 
sw2958A-ms98-a-0041 287.499375 290.364875 so um
sw2958A-ms98-a-0042 290.364875 298.150500 the alternative was to put him back in the hospital which we did and they took care of him you know and he slowly deteriorated and uh
sw2958A-ms98-a-0043 298.150500 307.159375 to the point where he uh became fairly stable i mean he he knew who we were when we went in to visit him [noise] even though he couldn't communicate with us
sw2958A-ms98-a-0044 307.159375 315.185250 and then they said that um there was nothing more that they could do for him and he had to go into a nursing home the doctor said that he couldn't come back with us
sw2958A-ms98-a-0045 315.185250 317.866375 because we couldn't take care of him
sw2958A-ms98-a-0046 317.866375 326.619750 and we started looking around and they said no the first nursing home that's closest to you that has an available bed is where he's going to go
sw2958A-ms98-a-0047 326.619750 328.965125 so we didn't have much of a choice
sw2958A-ms98-a-0048 328.965125 331.206375 [silence]
sw2958A-ms98-a-0049 331.206375 341.444875 well at least up here um so he went in there anyhow and my wife went in there every day to see him and you know she
sw2958A-ms98-a-0050 341.444875 344.710625 uh at first w[ell]- at first no
sw2958A-ms98-a-0051 344.710625 354.137000 [noise] it's uh [vocalized-noise] it's very cold uh or at least we thought it was they're very clinical they're it's like a [vocalized-noise] well it's a business 
sw2958A-ms98-a-0052 354.137000 358.136375 you get them_1 in uh you do what you have to do for them_1 and that's it
sw2958A-ms98-a-0053 358.136375 367.711875 um so I would go on weekends and she would go during the day to to visit him and they had a laundry you know they had the whole facility was there but
sw2958A-ms98-a-0054 367.711875 372.801875 closed up most of the time so she'd go in and she'd do his laundry for him and she'd go in and feed him and 
sw2958A-ms98-a-0055 372.801875 383.686375 and it got to the point where um they we knew them just as much as they knew us and and they really cared for him at you know he was in there for almost six months
sw2958A-ms98-a-0056 383.686375 386.655375 [silence]
sw2958A-ms98-a-0057 386.655375 394.031000 with the nursing home right um and it was run the nursing home was run by uh
sw2958A-ms98-a-0058 394.031000 397.764250 regular staff but it was owned by Seventh Day Adventists
sw2958A-ms98-a-0059 397.764250 403.376000 which was a surprise to us you know we didn't realize that they had i guess
sw2958A-ms98-a-0060 403.376000 404.916250 [silence]
sw2958A-ms98-a-0061 404.916250 408.134250 uh but most of the people were
sw2958A-ms98-a-0062 408.134250 409.897250 [silence]
sw2958A-ms98-a-0063 409.897250 412.924625 well they didn't have anything to do with it they owned it
sw2958A-ms98-a-0064 412.924625 414.317125 but they
sw2958A-ms98-a-0065 414.317125 422.011375 i suppose they cared how it was run but they had an administrator that ran it and and most of the people were um
sw2958A-ms98-a-0066 422.011375 428.371875 [noise] uh aliens you know uh Jamaicans or Africans or
sw2958A-ms98-a-0067 428.371875 440.507750 and they uh they took real good care of him they uh he had lost a pair of slippers uh one day and one of them out of her own money bought a [vocalized-noise] pair of slippers for him and you know that type of thing 
sw2958A-ms98-a-0068 440.507750 451.958000 but i think only because my wife spent so much time there she was there i mean every single day during the week and then on weekends we would go in the both of us
sw2958A-ms98-a-0069 451.958000 459.955625 and she would do things and she would donate little things and she'd help clean up the tables and you know that type of thing so um
sw2958A-ms98-a-0070 459.955625 469.864250 but you're right when most when most people end up in there and i hear it from a lot of elderly people their greatest fear is that they're going to end up there and nobody's going to see them [noise]
sw2958A-ms98-a-0071 469.864250 473.907500 they'll be abused but you hear horror stories all the time
sw2958A-ms98-a-0072 473.907500 476.044750 but if you care
sw2958A-ms98-a-0073 476.044750 479.041375 then it makes a difference those people
sw2958A-ms98-a-0074 479.041375 483.719250 that have uh a a lot of visitors
sw2958A-ms98-a-0075 483.719250 486.943125 and we had a gentleman that uh that uh
sw2958A-ms98-a-0076 486.943125 499.841875 [noise] let's see maybe about a week after my father-in-law was in there he shared his room he came in he could get around fairly well uh he he again had a had a stroke and he was partially paralyzed 
sw2958A-ms98-a-0077 499.841875 510.877875 but he was young enough where they gave him therapy and he was beginning to move up but he could talk and [laughter] [laughter-tell] [laughter-us] things oh you want to see what they're doing here and do you want to see this but don't tell anybody you know [laughter] 
sw2958A-ms98-a-0078 510.877875 515.149625 yeah yeah in fact uh
sw2958A-ms98-a-0079 515.149625 520.544875 we go down to see him she goes down occasionally maybe maybe uh once or twice a week j[ust]- just to see him
sw2958A-ms98-a-0080 520.544875 527.322750 and uh i'll stop in maybe once or once or twice a month on the weekend i'll go down to see him
sw2958A-ms98-a-0081 527.322750 542.296000 uh yes but he gets out he can get out you know he can uh he's got a lot of friends and they take him here and they take him there so he's not as as bad off as some of the people because some of them_1 are in there and in the six months that my father-in-law was in there 
sw2958A-ms98-a-0082 542.296000 549.543250 um i've i've seen a lot of them_1 that didn't have any visitors whatsoever at least while i was there
sw2958A-ms98-a-0083 549.543250 551.018500 [silence]
sw2958A-ms98-a-0084 551.018500 553.801125 yeah they just uh
sw2958A-ms98-a-0085 553.801125 566.216750 yeah and uh we had an old dog an old shepherd uh they were inseparable my father-in-law and the dog we brought the dog down there and it was nice and all the old people oh look at the dog and 
sw2958A-ms98-a-0086 566.216750 576.618875 well most people don't do that you know they don't uh they don't they fi[gure]- figure once you're in there you forget everything and that's that's really not the case and it's it's sad um 
sw2958A-ms98-a-0087 576.618875 583.360750 i hope that i never get into that situation where you know the kids will say well okay dad you know here you go
sw2958A-ms98-a-0088 583.360750 587.366875 i think i'll walk off into the mountains somewhere or out into the
sw2958A-ms98-a-0089 587.366875 588.619250 [laughter]
sw2958A-ms98-a-0090 588.619250 593.465000 but yeah yeah and you know and there's something to say for that i think
sw2958A-ms98-a-0091 593.465000 594.909000 [silence]
sw2958A-ms98-a-0092 594.909000 598.065250 right they do and and the people that
sw2958A-ms98-a-0093 598.065250 599.720000 that have families that don't
