sw2941A-ms98-a-0014 37.971875 48.069875 khaki pants and a shirt and tie i never wear a sport coat that's ridiculous but then most of the time you know then i just have to uh i can wear jeans or
sw2941A-ms98-a-0015 48.069875 55.989750 or just casual clothes i think they i think they frown on shorts and sneakers but i think i could probably get away with jeans and sneakers uh

sw2941A-ms98-a-0157 582.585250 593.246125 [laughter] it was very funny you know and all that over a pair of cowboy boots and it was finally my mother convinced him she you know the cowboy boots give you about uh an inch lift you know they sort of have a heavier heel
sw2941A-ms98-a-0158 593.246125 599.912000 and she and we're all short the whole family's short so she said well Sam if he wears cowboys that gives him another inch and it just may be
