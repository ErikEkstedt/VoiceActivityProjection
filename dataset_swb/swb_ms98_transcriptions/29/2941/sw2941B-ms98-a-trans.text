sw2941B-ms98-a-0019 74.531625 86.878875 uh outside clothing you know like for the summer time and uh in the winter time i guess you can pretty much wear what you want as long as it's presentable that's what i consider
sw2941B-ms98-a-0020 86.878875 89.634875 you know just don't get too outrageous here
sw2941B-ms98-a-0021 89.634875 91.436750 [silence]
sw2941B-ms98-a-0022 91.436750 100.056625 and not too dressy like you know after five stuff i've nev[er]- some of them get sort of touchy too so
sw2941B-ms98-a-0023 100.056625 105.682625 and uh the women you see you have you can't wear halters or nothing like that i mean at all
sw2941B-ms98-a-0024 105.682625 110.264750 like even if you got a jacket on you got to have a bra on and all that stuff
sw2941B-ms98-a-0025 110.264750 122.218125 which no big deal [laughter] to me [laughter] so but as far as dress for dressing for work that i don't it doesn't bother me i'd prefer if we had a uniform
sw2941B-ms98-a-0026 122.218125 126.643750 i really would to save a lot of money if you had a uniform
sw2941B-ms98-a-0027 126.643750 133.465625 because when i while i was in the service and see i had clothes that i could wear whenever i got ready but
sw2941B-ms98-a-0028 133.465625 141.186000 you had to wear that uniform to work and so you knew what you was going to wear wasn't no what am i going to wear today [laughter]

sw2941B-ms98-a-0031 143.683625 145.835250 that's right
sw2941B-ms98-a-0032 145.835250 150.451250 i wouldn't mind having a uniform people think i'm crazy but
sw2941B-ms98-a-0033 150.451250 153.606000 [silence]
sw2941B-ms98-a-0034 153.606000 155.388750 uh-huh
sw2941B-ms98-a-0035 155.388750 157.573875 that's right
sw2941B-ms98-a-0036 157.573875 161.218625 yeah because it it doesn't mess up your clothes either
sw2941B-ms98-a-0037 161.218625 166.276000 you know because like at work if something gets on my clothes and ruins it it's just ruined
sw2941B-ms98-a-0038 166.276000 176.740000 [silence]

sw2941B-ms98-a-0040 181.914875 194.598625 and they give you the uniform so it it's supplied so you know if it messes up hey it's their [vocalized-noise] uniform they messed it up [vocalized-noise] you only wear it you know to Wendy's so if you mess it up at Wendy's
sw2941B-ms98-a-0041 194.598625 196.211250 there's no big deal
sw2941B-ms98-a-0042 196.211250 198.552125 [silence]
sw2941B-ms98-a-0043 198.552125 205.175000 but you know uh of course TI i'm sure if they ever went to uniforms they're not going to just give them to you
sw2941B-ms98-a-0044 205.175000 206.158000 [laughter]
sw2941B-ms98-a-0045 206.158000 216.412750 but now some of the people around here do wear uniforms you know the the facility guys or maintenance crew and the truck drivers and all of them have have TI [vocalized-noise]
