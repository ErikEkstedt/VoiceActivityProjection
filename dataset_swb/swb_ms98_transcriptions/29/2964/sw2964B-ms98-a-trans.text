sw2964B-ms98-a-0004 3.934375 10.512875 i am probably uh closer to being a what is it the ten is on the end of uh no gun control [laughter]
sw2964B-ms98-a-0005 10.512875 20.581000 i guess i am probably closer to a ten than a one i be[lieve]- i am uh i am not opposed at all to having a waiting period for you know for the purchase of guns
sw2964B-ms98-a-0006 20.581000 30.807625 uh i think that is appropriate uh a background check on people that uh [noise] excuse me espec[ially]- especially people that buy handguns
sw2964B-ms98-a-0007 30.807625 38.390750 uh but [vocalized-noise] i believe that uh you know the Constitution gives uh the individual the right to own
sw2964B-ms98-a-0008 38.390750 45.642000 firearms for you know for their whatever their own purposes are as long as they are legal purposes
sw2964B-ms98-a-0009 45.642000 51.434125 and uh i am opposed to anything that would limit what the Constitution allows
sw2964B-ms98-a-0010 51.434125 61.415125 [silence]
sw2964B-ms98-a-0011 61.415125 71.861125 yeah i- i- i uh i agree with that uh although i can i can see where there might be even be a a potential uh sometime you [laughter-know] a need sometime in the future for the individuals to have
sw2964B-ms98-a-0012 71.861125 83.600750 uh even machine guns available uh you know if if we were ever invaded of course now that is pretty far fetched but if the United States were ever invaded i think that the
sw2964B-ms98-a-0013 83.600750 89.765750 man on the street is going have to be the one to defend the country at some point or or might have to at some point
sw2964B-ms98-a-0014 89.765750 95.219000 and uh i think that there should be uh s[ufficient]- sufficient uh
sw2964B-ms98-a-0015 95.219000 98.865125 guns and you know and ammunition and things available for that
sw2964B-ms98-a-0016 98.865125 123.688125 [silence]

sw2964B-ms98-a-0019 127.404500 135.347375 yeah well i- i always wondered you know why he was so adamant about you know about being opposed to that waiting period
sw2964B-ms98-a-0020 135.347375 143.213750 uh you know even before i mean you know i- i did not see that the waiting period was a you know it was a major restriction

sw2964B-ms98-a-0029 163.159500 169.986000 yeah and uh plus you know [vocalized-noise] i guess my opinion is that if uh if a uh
sw2964B-ms98-a-0030 169.986000 177.836500 criminal or somebody with criminal intent real criminal intent wants a gun they are going to get one
sw2964B-ms98-a-0031 177.836500 183.982375 uh the drug dealer is not going to you know he's not going to wait the seven days for a gun anyway
sw2964B-ms98-a-0032 183.982375 188.414000 so it is it is only the actually it is only the [laughter] the uh
sw2964B-ms98-a-0033 188.414000 190.527750 the people that are trying to be
sw2964B-ms98-a-0034 190.527750 194.024375 uh law abiding people are the ones that are going to wind up
sw2964B-ms98-a-0035 194.024375 196.606750 being able to get the guns legally
sw2964B-ms98-a-0036 196.606750 209.320250 uh you know af[ter]- even with the waiting period and i you know i cannot see that uh that there is anybody that that does not have criminal intent that would have uh any reason to object to that waiting period that is
sw2964B-ms98-a-0037 209.320250 220.532250 [silence]
sw2964B-ms98-a-0038 220.532250 222.125500 yeah Whitman

sw2964B-ms98-a-0042 240.025500 248.995000 right well uh you know Hinckley was the one that took the shot at Reagan and uh he bought his gun at a pawn shop here in Dallas i think or somewhere in the Dallas area
sw2964B-ms98-a-0043 248.995000 253.432500 and you know if if he'd had to have a waiting period he didn't stay in Dallas long enough
sw2964B-ms98-a-0044 253.432500 256.955000 uh at that time to have waited the seven days
sw2964B-ms98-a-0045 256.955000 260.160500 so if if there'd been a waiting period he wouldn't have had the gun
sw2964B-ms98-a-0046 260.160500 263.915750 uh or a least he wouldn't have had that gun he might've had another one
sw2964B-ms98-a-0047 263.915750 265.386500 but uh
sw2964B-ms98-a-0048 265.386500 268.727500 you know so i you know i can see that there are
sw2964B-ms98-a-0049 268.727500 273.344125 are reasons for having a waiting period that uh i think that anybody that
sw2964B-ms98-a-0050 273.344125 282.466500 you know anybody that does not have a a criminal background or you know any any real reason to not allow them to have one i think that anybody that wants one should be able to buy one
sw2964B-ms98-a-0051 282.466500 288.374875 that's interesting because i don't own one though i don't own a gun but that's you know that's my personal opinion anyway

sw2964B-ms98-a-0059 332.958875 335.747250 kind of [vocalized-noise] the the American way so to speak

sw2964B-ms98-a-0061 344.436875 345.728750 uh
sw2964B-ms98-a-0062 345.728750 348.976125 yeah i believe it was yeah
sw2964B-ms98-a-0063 348.976125 361.021875 uh there was a a uh deal on television just uh i saw it uh yesterday or the day before where there was an an Oriental shopkeeper in California i think it was in San Bernardino California
sw2964B-ms98-a-0064 361.021875 367.283000 That there were five young guys they were gang members that came in to rob his store
sw2964B-ms98-a-0065 367.283000 375.992000 and they all had guns and he had a gun somewhere under the counter that he got and he shot all five of those killed two of them_1
sw2964B-ms98-a-0066 375.992000 380.835000 but you know he he was really blazing away
sw2964B-ms98-a-0067 380.835000 389.796125 and uh i think he got shot twice himself and uh but he was okay you know it was just he was injured but not seriously apparently
sw2964B-ms98-a-0068 389.796125 399.957375 but uh you know it was really surprising but it was good you know [laughter] from my point of view it was good to see him being able to defend him you know his his property and his store
sw2964B-ms98-a-0069 399.957375 411.966125 and uh you know i- i think that's you know that is the intent of the Constitution is to of that part of the Constitution is to allow people to defend themselves and their property

sw2964B-ms98-a-0083 479.094500 482.640875 um-hum i had i had not heard about him robbing the Safeway
sw2964B-ms98-a-0084 482.640875 486.030875 but then there is also there is the uh what is his name Bernie Getz
sw2964B-ms98-a-0085 486.030875 498.846125 the in the New York subway i guess uh well i would have [vocalized-noise] even mixed emotions about him uh somebody carrying a gun you know out into the public on public transportation
sw2964B-ms98-a-0086 498.846125 509.588625 uh you know of course he was his the purpose of him having the gun was to defend himself because he apparently he had felt threatened you know on the on the subway before
sw2964B-ms98-a-0087 509.588625 512.334125 but uh i am not sure that uh
sw2964B-ms98-a-0088 512.334125 514.777625 the private citizen carrying a gun
sw2964B-ms98-a-0089 514.777625 516.135250 is
sw2964B-ms98-a-0090 516.135250 519.569750 you know just the routine private citizen carrying a gun
sw2964B-ms98-a-0091 519.569750 522.173375 is uh necessary to
sw2964B-ms98-a-0092 522.173375 528.348000 i mean if you are not if you are not uh in a position where you have to defend yourself you know
sw2964B-ms98-a-0093 528.348000 531.491375 uh in a routine basis then uh
sw2964B-ms98-a-0094 531.491375 535.060500 perhaps carrying a gun on your person is not uh
sw2964B-ms98-a-0095 535.060500 537.992125 is not all that advisable
sw2964B-ms98-a-0096 537.992125 547.589125 uh i know that they are talking about here you know here in Texas about having a new gun law that would allow c[ertain]- certain individuals to be licensed to carry a gun
sw2964B-ms98-a-0097 547.589125 548.996375 and uh
sw2964B-ms98-a-0098 548.996375 555.905625 i think they ought take a long a good long hard look at at who is allowed to carry a gun in those you know in those situations

sw2964B-ms98-a-0107 585.908125 592.649500 i do not really know uh i- i guess there is not really a you know a lot to say from my point of view except that
sw2964B-ms98-a-0108 592.649500 599.829125 you know the the Constitution says what kind of rights we have and i do not i really do not see the the point
