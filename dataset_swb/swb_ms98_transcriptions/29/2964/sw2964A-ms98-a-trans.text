sw2964A-ms98-a-0017 114.477750 124.663125 just this last year it seems like he's he was uh and he was not that bill does not restrict anything outside of just having to wait seven days but
sw2964A-ms98-a-0018 124.663125 127.838125 it is interesting that he turned around for some reason

sw2964A-ms98-a-0026 152.214250 157.343000 what uh uh a good gun costs like two hundred to five hundred dollars
sw2964A-ms98-a-0027 157.343000 160.664500 you know a handgun they go out and buy the cheapest thing they can
sw2964A-ms98-a-0028 160.664500 164.774750 and and then they go rob a liquor store or something

sw2964A-ms98-a-0039 212.988625 215.460000 and a lot of times like um
sw2964A-ms98-a-0040 215.460000 221.810000 what is his name i can't remember his name right the guy in the Austin tower uh Whitman
sw2964A-ms98-a-0041 221.810000 232.692375 you know he was sane and and i guess they could have said like Lee Harvey Os[wald]- Oswald was sane when he bought his gun you know but he bought his by mail anyway
sw2964A-ms98-a-0042 232.692375 240.400750 but later on you know something can happen they can they can have a brain tumor or they can break down one way or another

sw2964A-ms98-a-0060 299.783875 303.654625 it gives them a foothold to to be against somebody else

sw2964A-ms98-a-0062 305.140250 308.417625 and uh and the hunters you know the hunters uh
sw2964A-ms98-a-0063 308.417625 315.638000 with what game species there are left well especially i mean using a rifle white tail deers mostly
sw2964A-ms98-a-0064 315.638000 318.920625 you know that is what people hunt for the most with a rifle
sw2964A-ms98-a-0065 318.920625 322.497625 uh you know they have every right to have a
sw2964A-ms98-a-0066 322.497625 325.655000 a rifle and be able to to hunt

sw2964A-ms98-a-0070 337.290500 345.108875 and that um i think it was a rifle that that kid shot that burglar with in Arlington or wherever it was
sw2964A-ms98-a-0071 345.108875 349.220625 yes i think it's two years ago or so now

sw2964A-ms98-a-0083 412.771000 422.883000 and and more and more of that kind of thing happens i mean can you imagine i mean it used to be like with the dapper bandit is one guy you know
sw2964A-ms98-a-0084 422.883000 427.857875 with a gun and a a lot of the stuff that he did they did not publicize
sw2964A-ms98-a-0085 427.857875 432.447250 because th[at]- it would breach the security of the rest of the ba[nks]- the banks
sw2964A-ms98-a-0086 432.447250 446.153375 one of the things that he did is is um any counter top that was there up to maybe like four feet high he could vertical jump on top of the counter top and and jump down and and be
sw2964A-ms98-a-0087 446.153375 449.720875 with those people behind the counter before they knew it
sw2964A-ms98-a-0088 449.720875 459.550000 you know and they they showed us a piece of tape of that one time but it looked like they had cut it up some that was one of the things that was so scary about him
sw2964A-ms98-a-0089 459.550000 464.576750 and not only did he he um rob banks but he uh
sw2964A-ms98-a-0090 464.576750 474.465125 at the time when he first started he robbed the Safeway that my brother was working at at the time [noise] and that is how he that is how he surprised the cashier [noise]
sw2964A-ms98-a-0091 474.465125 480.242500 he jumped he jumped back there with her and and you know there was nothing she could do by that time

sw2964A-ms98-a-0110 554.880125 561.280250 like the the judge what was it two or three months ago the judge in uh Fort Worth i think
sw2964A-ms98-a-0111 561.280250 563.206875 maybe it was Dallas
sw2964A-ms98-a-0112 563.206875 572.511625 but he he just convicted uh a man for murder and the guy jumped up and and apparently knew where the judge kept his gun 
sw2964A-ms98-a-0113 572.511625 575.856000 and held it on him for a couple of hours you know and
sw2964A-ms98-a-0114 575.856000 576.887625 [silence]
sw2964A-ms98-a-0115 576.887625 581.882125 he should he should either have kept it fairly well concealed or kept it a secret
