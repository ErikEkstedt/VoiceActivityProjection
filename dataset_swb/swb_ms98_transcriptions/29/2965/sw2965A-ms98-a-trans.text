sw2965A-ms98-a-0007 17.533500 18.543375 [silence]
sw2965A-ms98-a-0008 18.543375 25.999250 and uh i have a fr[iend]- a friend whose real good with uh repairing cars
sw2965A-ms98-a-0009 25.999250 31.114750 so i got him to take the alternator off and take it and uh
sw2965A-ms98-a-0010 31.114750 33.553875 you know get a replacement part
sw2965A-ms98-a-0011 33.553875 34.586500 [silence]
sw2965A-ms98-a-0012 34.586500 36.538625 we went to a uh
sw2965A-ms98-a-0013 36.538625 42.155250 a a place called Quality Auto Parts an and their parts are
sw2965A-ms98-a-0014 42.155250 45.996750 supposed to be guaranteed and and everything and they're
sw2965A-ms98-a-0015 45.996750 54.084375 they're uh very reasonable so uh i bought the alternator we p[ut]- put it on the car
sw2965A-ms98-a-0016 54.084375 59.427125 and it it didn't work and it blew out all the fuses
sw2965A-ms98-a-0017 59.427125 61.609250 yeah
sw2965A-ms98-a-0018 61.609250 63.387750 [silence]
sw2965A-ms98-a-0019 63.387750 65.241875 uh
sw2965A-ms98-a-0020 65.241875 66.247375 [silence]
sw2965A-ms98-a-0021 66.247375 71.249375 i be[lieve]- something like sixty nine dollars some[thing]- something on that order
sw2965A-ms98-a-0022 71.249375 72.877875 [silence]
sw2965A-ms98-a-0023 72.877875 75.261750 no he hooked it up right
sw2965A-ms98-a-0024 75.261750 78.581625 it it was just that the the part
sw2965A-ms98-a-0025 78.581625 82.228000 just just didn't fit the car so
sw2965A-ms98-a-0026 82.228000 93.659375 i took it back and uh he he took the alter[nator]- the guy in in the parts shop took the alternator and he put it on the little thing he has in there to test them
sw2965A-ms98-a-0027 93.659375 101.124000 and uh he said there was nothing wrong with the alternator so we we went back and tried it again
sw2965A-ms98-a-0028 101.124000 104.041500 put it on again and it still didn't work
sw2965A-ms98-a-0029 104.041500 110.227125 and we took the car up to um a little place called Pep Boys i don't know if you have them in your area
sw2965A-ms98-a-0030 110.227125 111.796750 but uh they're
sw2965A-ms98-a-0031 111.796750 115.813125 they're pretty reasonable uh car repair place also
sw2965A-ms98-a-0032 115.813125 118.959750 so uh took it up there
sw2965A-ms98-a-0033 118.959750 125.377625 towed it up there because it you know wouldn't start or anything and this thing just kept blowing out the fuses
sw2965A-ms98-a-0034 125.377625 130.030000 and uh took them about an an hour
sw2965A-ms98-a-0035 130.030000 137.131625 to um figure out what was what was blowing the fuse and it was it was the alternator that was blowing the fuse anyway
sw2965A-ms98-a-0036 137.131625 147.912125 ended up taking it to the Toyota dealer and the only problem was that uh it had to be a genuine Toyota uh alternator
sw2965A-ms98-a-0037 147.912125 152.630625 because most of the other ones that they say will fit it
sw2965A-ms98-a-0038 152.630625 157.984625 that that you know they sit in there and everything but there's just some little difference that
sw2965A-ms98-a-0039 157.984625 159.756500 um
sw2965A-ms98-a-0040 159.756500 162.385625 causes it not to work
sw2965A-ms98-a-0041 162.385625 163.881625 [vocalized-noise]

sw2965A-ms98-a-0059 271.096250 282.326250 well my car is uh it's an eighty six and i really hadn't had any any trouble with it un[til]- until that and the car now has a hundred and thirty something
sw2965A-ms98-a-0060 282.326250 285.012125 thousand miles on it and uh
sw2965A-ms98-a-0061 285.012125 287.485750 and this was just recent
sw2965A-ms98-a-0062 287.485750 290.918750 so i really can't complain about this one
sw2965A-ms98-a-0063 290.918750 293.282250 [silence]
sw2965A-ms98-a-0064 293.282250 295.618625 um well i used
sw2965A-ms98-a-0065 295.618625 299.945500 i used to work uh it was a seventy mile trip everyday
sw2965A-ms98-a-0066 299.945500 301.619125 [silence]
sw2965A-ms98-a-0067 301.619125 304.943750 you know two ways was seventy miles
sw2965A-ms98-a-0068 304.943750 308.652750 no it was it was just seventy miles yeah
sw2965A-ms98-a-0069 308.652750 316.022500 and uh i did that for about three years and it really it really added up
sw2965A-ms98-a-0070 316.022500 318.761125 i've only taken uh
sw2965A-ms98-a-0071 318.761125 324.652875 maybe two trips that were about four hours long dow[n]- uh
sw2965A-ms98-a-0072 324.652875 327.112875 down to Shreveport
sw2965A-ms98-a-0073 327.112875 328.452000 [silence]
sw2965A-ms98-a-0074 328.452000 334.556375 and uh the rest of it was you know it's just basically driving a long ways to work
sw2965A-ms98-a-0075 334.556375 339.129375 and now i drive like twenty twenty three miles each way
sw2965A-ms98-a-0076 339.129375 340.491875 so
sw2965A-ms98-a-0077 340.491875 346.754125 i'm getting a little a little uh little relief but still i drive a long ways
sw2965A-ms98-a-0078 346.754125 348.453750 [silence]
sw2965A-ms98-a-0079 348.453750 351.792000 but i guess because they're highway miles
sw2965A-ms98-a-0080 351.792000 355.236750 you know it's not so bad on your car as
sw2965A-ms98-a-0081 355.236750 357.890125 as if it you know were just
sw2965A-ms98-a-0082 357.890125 359.728375 regular street
sw2965A-ms98-a-0083 359.728375 361.350625 you know

sw2965A-ms98-a-0097 419.016500 420.352500 uh-huh
sw2965A-ms98-a-0098 420.352500 424.422750 well i don't know if i've done it quite that much but uh

sw2965A-ms98-a-0100 427.957625 428.999875 [laughter]
sw2965A-ms98-a-0101 428.999875 430.746500 um
sw2965A-ms98-a-0102 430.746500 434.565250 uh let's see before i had this car i had a um
sw2965A-ms98-a-0103 434.565250 435.651750 [silence]
sw2965A-ms98-a-0104 435.651750 438.305250 um i bought an Audi five thousand
sw2965A-ms98-a-0105 438.305250 439.911750 [silence]
sw2965A-ms98-a-0106 439.911750 442.964625 but i bought it i bought it used
sw2965A-ms98-a-0107 442.964625 451.324000 i i just bought it from a friend who was going to who just charged me what the dealer was going to give give him for it for a trade-in
sw2965A-ms98-a-0108 451.324000 453.466000 and uh
sw2965A-ms98-a-0109 453.466000 461.270500 it had a whole lot of miles on it i i figured maybe i'd get one or two years out of it an i an i did get a couple of good years
sw2965A-ms98-a-0110 461.270500 463.576250 out of it and the uh
sw2965A-ms98-a-0111 463.576250 466.778000 the engine messed up on me
sw2965A-ms98-a-0112 466.778000 467.872250 [silence]
sw2965A-ms98-a-0113 467.872250 473.921750 and then i gave it to a guy to repair who works for the aut[omotive]- for the Audi dealer
sw2965A-ms98-a-0114 473.921750 477.526625 and uh he took the engine apart and
sw2965A-ms98-a-0115 477.526625 478.553500 [silence]
sw2965A-ms98-a-0116 478.553500 483.278000 you know he just said he couldn't fix it so the engine never got put back together again
sw2965A-ms98-a-0117 483.278000 485.686250 [silence]
sw2965A-ms98-a-0118 485.686250 486.928250 i
sw2965A-ms98-a-0119 486.928250 490.518375 [silence]
sw2965A-ms98-a-0120 490.518375 492.082000 wow
sw2965A-ms98-a-0121 492.082000 494.629250 i think those old cars
sw2965A-ms98-a-0122 494.629250 499.594250 might might be a pretty good bet because [laughter-you]
sw2965A-ms98-a-0123 499.594250 501.563625 i don't know i-
sw2965A-ms98-a-0124 501.563625 509.552875 [silence]
sw2965A-ms98-a-0125 509.552875 510.994750 uh-huh
sw2965A-ms98-a-0126 510.994750 512.008375 [silence]
sw2965A-ms98-a-0127 512.008375 513.379000 um
sw2965A-ms98-a-0128 513.379000 526.000500 [silence]
sw2965A-ms98-a-0129 526.000500 527.671750 uh-huh
sw2965A-ms98-a-0130 527.671750 534.156875 i read a book one time that said that the best cars were made before seventy four
sw2965A-ms98-a-0131 534.156875 550.407625 [silence]
sw2965A-ms98-a-0132 550.407625 552.163875 uh-huh
sw2965A-ms98-a-0133 552.163875 557.988250 [silence]
sw2965A-ms98-a-0134 557.988250 559.290875 yeah
sw2965A-ms98-a-0135 559.290875 560.627250 [silence]
sw2965A-ms98-a-0136 560.627250 562.673375 yeah it's easy to
sw2965A-ms98-a-0137 562.673375 568.771750 it's easy i guess it's still easy to find engines for those cars engines and transmissions
sw2965A-ms98-a-0138 568.771750 574.744750 and if you i guess if you keep trad[ing]- changing them out you can keep a car for a long time
sw2965A-ms98-a-0139 574.744750 575.810250 [silence]
sw2965A-ms98-a-0140 575.810250 580.613875 course i guess i could do the same thing with the the Toyota that i have
sw2965A-ms98-a-0141 580.613875 583.719625 i just don't know how much they'll [laughter] charge me to
sw2965A-ms98-a-0142 583.719625 588.965875 [silence]
sw2965A-ms98-a-0143 588.965875 590.275000 yeah
sw2965A-ms98-a-0144 590.275000 591.622500 [silence]
sw2965A-ms98-a-0145 591.622500 597.352375 i guess so but i just think they cost too much in the in the first place
sw2965A-ms98-a-0146 597.352375 599.054375 now a days
