sw2965B-ms98-a-0018 177.528125 178.605250 [silence]
sw2965B-ms98-a-0019 178.605250 185.565125 um i'm not sure right in front of the f[an]- fan it's a it's an air conditioner sensing device i don't know why
sw2965B-ms98-a-0020 185.565125 191.558500 it actually there's a metal piece that fits through the belts uh
sw2965B-ms98-a-0021 191.558500 194.399125 and somehow that broke off
sw2965B-ms98-a-0022 194.399125 201.063250 and uh i i still can't figure out how it broke and uh
sw2965B-ms98-a-0023 201.063250 206.490625 anyway so a this piece obviously um i have a Subaru and uh
sw2965B-ms98-a-0024 206.490625 210.810625 i think you can only get it through Subaru dealer etcetera so
sw2965B-ms98-a-0025 210.810625 215.842750 uh this little sensing device costed like sixty bucks [laughter]
sw2965B-ms98-a-0026 215.842750 217.601375 [silence]
sw2965B-ms98-a-0027 217.601375 224.646875 and and i haven't had too many problems with my car i got a eighty eight Subaru GL XT and it uh
sw2965B-ms98-a-0028 224.646875 234.587500 uh and then you know just basic maintenance and oil changes an i and i do not do my oil changes and i will not do my oil changes i've
sw2965B-ms98-a-0029 234.587500 237.663000 i think the first time i tried to do one
sw2965B-ms98-a-0030 237.663000 239.223250 ended up

sw2965B-ms98-a-0032 240.224375 253.095625 um trying to ge[t]- uh you borrowed somebody else's jack and i did this and i went and bought everything so after buying the filter and all the oil you're looking at ten bucks at least or somewhere in there an
sw2965B-ms98-a-0033 253.095625 256.053750 and uh and then to go to the trouble
sw2965B-ms98-a-0034 256.053750 257.680000 that i figured
sw2965B-ms98-a-0035 257.680000 261.107750 it's [laughter] easier spending eighteen bucks at Jiffy Lube 
sw2965B-ms98-a-0036 261.107750 263.709500 so that that's um
sw2965B-ms98-a-0037 263.709500 270.260375 you know [noise] as far as any maintenance on my car that i shy away from the oil changes that's for sure
