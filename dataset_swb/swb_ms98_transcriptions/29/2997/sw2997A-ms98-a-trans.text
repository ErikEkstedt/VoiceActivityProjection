sw2997A-ms98-a-0007 21.778500 33.023125 well i basic feeling is that everybody performs some sort of public service no matter what career path they take unless they are just absolute dropouts
sw2997A-ms98-a-0008 33.023125 40.837625 and uh part of my reaction is that uh some people particularly those that are gifted and talented
sw2997A-ms98-a-0009 40.837625 49.160000 uh and highly motivated uh ought to get on with their lives and uh and do the thing that they do best
sw2997A-ms98-a-0010 49.160000 56.131375 you know if somebody wants to become a doctor or a uh dedicated professional and they're serious about it
sw2997A-ms98-a-0011 56.131375 65.842375 uh i hate to see their their lives put on hold for a year or two while they uh uh they do something that's uh not down their alley

sw2997A-ms98-a-0035 213.093625 222.729500 yeah i think one of the reactions i had was when i graduated from college i was all set to uh go into military service and and do my part
sw2997A-ms98-a-0036 222.729500 232.550625 and uh when it the end of my four years and i got my degree and i started talking to uh some of the recruiters for different companies 
sw2997A-ms98-a-0037 232.550625 242.808250 and uh one of them_1 sat me down and he said hey you know what are you going to do in two years in the military uh where are you going to go and and what's going to happen to you
sw2997A-ms98-a-0038 242.808250 255.630500 and they persuaded me that uh i could serve my country better by going to work for one of the uh military industrial companies in direct support of uh military operations
sw2997A-ms98-a-0039 255.630500 263.537375 and so that's where i've been ever since and so i don't regret uh not going into military service
sw2997A-ms98-a-0040 263.537375 266.161750 [silence]
sw2997A-ms98-a-0041 266.161750 268.095125 yeah but

sw2997A-ms98-a-0046 273.628125 288.463750 and uh everybody has there uh soapbox i have a lot of people come around to the house uh uh trying to solicit funds for some environmental action or preserve some form of wildlife
sw2997A-ms98-a-0047 288.463750 301.378250 and i turn them_1 down uh because i i choose to contribute directly in terms of energy and i've been involved in research diving on several occasions to uh 
sw2997A-ms98-a-0048 301.378250 313.511250 uh gain information about the environment and it contributes to the uh body of knowledge so i'd rather put my money in that form directly and i think a lot of people do things like that that uh
sw2997A-ms98-a-0049 313.511250 319.224875 they have their own applications that get them involved in the public

sw2997A-ms98-a-0063 378.836000 386.075750 she's getting paid for what she used to do as a volunteer but she's getting more more actively involved with the uh Sierra Club
sw2997A-ms98-a-0064 386.075750 389.657500 but that's that's the thing that she wants to do
