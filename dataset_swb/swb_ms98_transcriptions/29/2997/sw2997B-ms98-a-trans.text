sw2997B-ms98-a-0004 8.893250 21.127125 three small ones okay_1 would you feel like those youngsters could be raised with a balanced life understanding all of the aspects of their lives if they did not perform some kind of public service

sw2997B-ms98-a-0010 64.896500 71.265000 well you're looking at it from a perspective of something equivalent to the draft where you take two years out of your life and
sw2997B-ms98-a-0011 71.265000 81.611500 and serve as as a a a milit[ary]- in the military however they didn't say that it would be re[quired]- required to be two consecutive years what about the option
sw2997B-ms98-a-0012 81.611500 95.154250 of requiring these young people to have two years of public service in association perhaps with their education and that they get you know how we have uh life credits in college
sw2997B-ms98-a-0013 95.154250 106.999500 experience credits why could those not apply in exactly that way you actually are using that as a part of your college education and it's a quote public service course

sw2997B-ms98-a-0017 117.184125 119.351375 well it would be like an elective
sw2997B-ms98-a-0018 119.351375 125.272625 it would be the equivalent of an elective do you want to serve in the Peace Corps or do you want serve uh [vocalized-noise] 
sw2997B-ms98-a-0019 125.272625 134.452500 you know on a on a some sort of a social agency where you do volunteer work or perhaps you'd like to do reading for the blind for a couple of years in your spare time
sw2997B-ms98-a-0020 134.452500 138.580000 and it might be uh three hours a week that's what a class is 
sw2997B-ms98-a-0021 138.580000 145.680125 three or four hours a week then they have a balanced view i think of
sw2997B-ms98-a-0022 145.680125 155.217250 what is out there i know that a lot of young people are raised in a very protected environment mom and dad don't want them_1 exposed to the kinds of things that
sw2997B-ms98-a-0023 155.217250 168.845000 they had to endure or they had to go through they want a better life for their kids and they do put them in this wonderful little cocoon and then when they get out in the real world and life does give them_1 a good smack they go to their knees
sw2997B-ms98-a-0024 168.845000 180.337750 because they haven't had the experience in helping people therefore they don't have experience in seeking help or in
sw2997B-ms98-a-0025 180.337750 192.064375 being helped gracefully uh i- i myself have done a lot of volunteer work but i am very apprehensive about accepting help
sw2997B-ms98-a-0026 192.064375 198.919875 i'm very independent and i don't care much for that and i raised my children to be very independent
sw2997B-ms98-a-0027 198.919875 213.685375 and yet they did their share of volunteer work we went to the nursing homes and carried Christmas gifts and we visited sick people those are all good community service behaviors and activities and they don't require a big bite of your life

sw2997B-ms98-a-0065 326.603500 337.137500 [vocalized-noise] y[ou]- i don't know the the benefit to you is much of greater value if you are physically or emotionally involved in what you're doing i[t's]- it's no big deal to be emotionally involved in writing a check 
sw2997B-ms98-a-0066 337.137500 341.486750 i mean you know you don't really get involved and you don't really comprehend what you're accomplishing
sw2997B-ms98-a-0067 341.486750 348.565000 and i think that's important and that's the reason that i think that there should be some provision even if it's not mandatory
sw2997B-ms98-a-0068 348.565000 361.502875 at least provide the avenue through which young people can do volunteer work even if it is not a two year stint in the Peace Corps uh

sw2997B-ms98-a-0080 389.015500 401.884500 you got to remember though the nature of the person we're [vocalized-noise] when we're involved with here you you can expect someone like that perhaps to be willing to volunteer to get expend the energy to go out and find
sw2997B-ms98-a-0081 401.884500 405.159125 the area where they match very well
sw2997B-ms98-a-0082 405.159125 417.117000 but it might be of interest to put in some sort of a formal system like they do the screening system in the military service okay you know what are your interests and what are your aptitudes let's see if we can match you to a job that you prefer
sw2997B-ms98-a-0083 417.117000 420.293250 particularly with you have the education to deal with it
sw2997B-ms98-a-0084 420.293250 430.670500 i don't know that may or may not be uh a useful choice but i do know that there are a great deal of young people out there who would say why do i want to go
sw2997B-ms98-a-0085 430.670500 442.091625 you know out and get mosquito bit and s[leep]- sleep on a hard ground when i can sit here in this cushy bed and not go out and and uh i can have my music and drive my cars and have fun through the summer
sw2997B-ms98-a-0086 442.091625 449.964000 and there are a lot of them_1 who just do not have that sense of consciousness and i think maybe something in place might build that s[ense]-
