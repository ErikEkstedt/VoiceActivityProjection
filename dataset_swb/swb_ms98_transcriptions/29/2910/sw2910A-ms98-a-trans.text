sw2910A-ms98-a-0003 12.124000 23.271375 well i- i do about the same i guess but in a different fashion i- i- i'm from New York originally and now that i live in Florida i live in the Florida in the winter and then go back up north in the in the summertime
sw2910A-ms98-a-0004 23.271375 37.317125 and i i feel that the the only legitimate [laughter-paper] although it might sound a little elitist is the New York Times i've always read the New York Times when i was younger and i try to f[ind]- now that it has a national edition i read that i also read uh
sw2910A-ms98-a-0005 37.317125 45.819875 i- i- i guess i do watch uh McNeil Lehrer on P B S because i- i lean to that coverage and and i've i guess i'm [vocalized-noise]
sw2910A-ms98-a-0006 45.819875 46.917125 [silence]
sw2910A-ms98-a-0007 46.917125 56.643625 yeah well yeah that's a whole hour show actually it's an hour show each evening and and uh we we turn it on when we start dinner we seem to start dinner around six and finish it up
sw2910A-ms98-a-0008 56.643625 67.766250 i find that i'm leaning on uh i travel a great deal uh even overseas and i find that i lean on uh C N N quite a bit for concise and quick stuff and i'm
sw2910A-ms98-a-0009 67.766250 74.852250 i'm i- i'm quite satisfied with the way they put it out i mean i i don't believe everything they say but it it's it's coverage you know
sw2910A-ms98-a-0010 74.852250 79.791625 [silence]
sw2910A-ms98-a-0011 79.791625 81.261125 yeah

sw2910A-ms98-a-0014 87.055500 88.378875 uh [noise]
sw2910A-ms98-a-0015 88.378875 100.924250 well yeah i- i- i uh Peter Arnett was reporting direct from uh Iraq i think this is scandalous the way everybody's picking on him i- i think that what he he reported what he saw and if you didn't like it that was just too bad you know
sw2910A-ms98-a-0016 100.924250 106.827375 [silence]
sw2910A-ms98-a-0017 106.827375 109.818250 yeah oh yeah i mean i [vocalized-noise]
sw2910A-ms98-a-0018 109.818250 111.919750 no
sw2910A-ms98-a-0019 111.919750 124.526750 that that's right i think so and and i guess if it comes to um to magazines i don't read i used to when i was younger i subscribed to Time and U S News and World Report i- i have seemed to
sw2910A-ms98-a-0020 124.526750 129.568375 slide away from that and rely more on the local paper or
sw2910A-ms98-a-0021 129.568375 140.454000 i- i- i also subscribe to something called World Press which is uh a magazine that only talks about other uh excerpts from the world press which sort of gives you a different slant than it's not
sw2910A-ms98-a-0022 140.454000 144.960250 as slanted as the New York Times or as biased perhaps as a local paper
sw2910A-ms98-a-0023 144.960250 155.085750 but uh that i guess and the radio uh i listen to P B S radio a lot and i also listen to uh uh these twenty four hour news stations when i'm driving i
sw2910A-ms98-a-0024 155.085750 156.491000 [silence]

sw2910A-ms98-a-0029 164.986500 170.206375 yeah is that what what is that the San Francisco paper out there is uh the major paper
sw2910A-ms98-a-0030 170.206375 173.033375 yeah that's a terrible paper [laughter]
sw2910A-ms98-a-0031 173.033375 174.875000 [noise]
sw2910A-ms98-a-0032 174.875000 177.533750 [silence]

sw2910A-ms98-a-0037 186.338625 191.761500 oh yeah they ju[st]- [vocalized-noise] they really are the uh probably the worse papers i've ever read i [vocalized-noise]
sw2910A-ms98-a-0038 191.761500 197.463625 yeah well can you get the L A paper up there that's a pretty decent paper isn't it or

sw2910A-ms98-a-0042 201.391875 210.964000 yeah well that's another one i read i forgot that i read the Wall Street Journal not as in depth as i used to because they their articles seem to be getting even longer and [laughter-longer] [laughter-but]
sw2910A-ms98-a-0043 210.964000 212.043750 [laughter]
sw2910A-ms98-a-0044 212.043750 225.519500 yeah uh i think i- i agree with you that the problem seems to be they don't have enough time to do all the stuff uh i feel pretty well versed in in what i'm doing because i- i do spend more time on that than i do say on sports or 
sw2910A-ms98-a-0045 225.519500 233.706125 although i watch that i spend a lot of time reading about these things i'm quite interested i find it very exciting to for the coverage we have now today
