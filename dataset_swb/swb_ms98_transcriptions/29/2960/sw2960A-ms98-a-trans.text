sw2960A-ms98-a-0017 55.337500 63.873125 and the Cosby Show is uh is uh kind of unrealistic as a family unless you live in upper class and have money 
sw2960A-ms98-a-0018 63.873125 75.293250 i think that sometimes the things they show on there though uh the problems that their kids get into are are good to uh show that they do have problems anyway

sw2960A-ms98-a-0029 108.594500 118.447125 because it is not a show that he just becomes these people and then he lives there for a while and then he is gone he has to do something positive to help them
