sw2952B-ms98-a-0032 91.679000 102.270000 uh like when they want things like tricycles toys things that cost quite a lot in the store you can find that kind of stuff at garage sales for just a few dollars [laughter] and
sw2952B-ms98-a-0033 102.270000 104.459250 [silence]
sw2952B-ms98-a-0034 104.459250 113.612250 yeah oh you can just get all kinds of things and kids especially clothes and toys they just don't use them_1 and wear them_1 you know for that many years or anything
sw2952B-ms98-a-0035 113.612250 126.060000 so i'm i've become a garage sale shopper and it is fun on the weekends i drive around look to see you know who's selling what and i found my little daughter some tap shoes for her tap class and
sw2952B-ms98-a-0036 126.060000 132.968750 just you know all kinds of things like that that you'd probably pay thirty dollars for and i got them_1 for two dollars [laughter] yeah so
sw2952B-ms98-a-0037 132.968750 136.633750 [silence]
sw2952B-ms98-a-0038 136.633750 137.728875 yeah
sw2952B-ms98-a-0039 137.728875 149.494125 yeah it is i[t]- it does take more time but i don't work so uh that's something i've decided i'm going to make sure my kids have a have a happy growing up years and [laughter]
sw2952B-ms98-a-0040 149.494125 151.746000 yeah well
sw2952B-ms98-a-0041 151.746000 153.967000 well that's good i'm glad 
sw2952B-ms98-a-0042 153.967000 155.199000 [silence]
sw2952B-ms98-a-0043 155.199000 165.050875 [laughter-yeah] well at first when you first have a baby you uh seems to take every moment of your time partly because_1 you're not used to you know juggling your time around like that but
sw2952B-ms98-a-0044 165.050875 168.605125 eventually the you'll you'll be doing lots of stuff so
sw2952B-ms98-a-0045 168.605125 182.349000 but i think my husband is real into sports too he plays on a TI softball team and a church softball team and by the time he plays two games a week and i play a a game a week we go to lots of [laughter-softball]
sw2952B-ms98-a-0046 182.349000 191.212875 but the kids enjoy going because_1 there's usually a lot of other kids for them to play with and we that's getting outside and you know doing things they like to do too so
sw2952B-ms98-a-0047 191.212875 193.271750 [silence]
sw2952B-ms98-a-0048 193.271750 197.875000 yeah and one other thing we're doing this year is uh we bought Wet and Wild passes
sw2952B-ms98-a-0049 197.875000 207.886750 we've never done that before but the kids are always wanting to play in the water and uh like you said unless you have a pool in your backyard or access to a good place to play it's kind of hard
sw2952B-ms98-a-0050 207.886750 216.892625 and uh they have real good kiddie areas uh at both of the Wet and Wilds around here so we're planning on going two or three times a week [laughter]
sw2952B-ms98-a-0051 216.892625 224.397000 yeah i think it will yeah because_1 my oldest daughter's in school and she gets bored real fast when she's home with nothing to do
sw2952B-ms98-a-0052 224.397000 226.786125 so i think that'll be a lot of fun
sw2952B-ms98-a-0053 226.786125 228.958250 so we're looking forward to that
sw2952B-ms98-a-0054 228.958250 233.026750 [silence]
sw2952B-ms98-a-0055 233.026750 245.044875 [laughter] well when i got married i thought it was going to be fun [laughter] but my husband and i both i think consider it a chore it's our yard has had so many problems it's completely died out two times
sw2952B-ms98-a-0056 245.044875 252.527250 and uh we've had to start all over trying to plant grass and so it's become a chore [laughter] do you and your husband like to work in the yard
sw2952B-ms98-a-0057 252.527250 255.700750 [silence]
sw2952B-ms98-a-0058 255.700750 256.782250 yeah
