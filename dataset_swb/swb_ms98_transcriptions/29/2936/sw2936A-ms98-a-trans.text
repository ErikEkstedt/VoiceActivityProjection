sw2936A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.134625 [noise] 
sw2936A-ms98-a-0002 0.134625 6.498625 well i've had a a little bit longer to think here because uh they waited about ten calls before they found you Bob but
sw2936A-ms98-a-0003 6.498625 17.724500 uh i i've been thinking about the fact that the uh Gramm-Rudman Act that was eventua[lly]- originally passed uh to s[atisfy]- to s[atisfy]- satisfy some of these deficiencies and place a
sw2936A-ms98-a-0004 17.724500 27.674000 set of handcuffs on Congress just doesn't work because now we do things outside the Gramm-Rudman with consent of Congress i guess and that doesn't seem to help us to much
sw2936A-ms98-a-0005 27.674000 36.983250 uh i mean the savings and loan was a great example of that that's outside the Gulf War was outside so it doesn't it i guess we just don't have the resolve t[o]-
sw2936A-ms98-a-0006 36.983250 44.009125 to really face up and and and follow those instructions i[f]- if indeed they are politically viable
sw2936A-ms98-a-0007 44.009125 66.960500 [silence]
sw2936A-ms98-a-0008 66.960500 68.692875 yeah
sw2936A-ms98-a-0009 68.692875 77.776750 [silence]
sw2936A-ms98-a-0010 77.776750 79.231625 right
sw2936A-ms98-a-0011 79.231625 88.709250 [silence]
sw2936A-ms98-a-0012 88.709250 100.431000 uh it seems to me that that there's there's a couple of ways that that i've listened to uh various Congress people and the President and the opposition and other people propose and
sw2936A-ms98-a-0013 100.431000 104.999375 and one thing that's starting to ring a little true to me is um rather severe cuts in
sw2936A-ms98-a-0014 104.999375 116.999625 in the defense programs sin[ce]- like closing bases and closing down programs etcetera simply because i- i just don't believe as much as they want me to believe some of the special interests that you talk about
sw2936A-ms98-a-0015 116.999625 121.027000 that uh mother Russia is that much of a threat to us any longer
sw2936A-ms98-a-0016 121.027000 134.264125 i mean we're seeing this thing just crumble i[f]- if anything now i see the President wants another bi[llion]- two and a half billion to loan them money because he's afraid of the outright uh chaos and confusion and anarchy because there's no food over there
sw2936A-ms98-a-0017 134.264125 137.733625 [silence]

sw2936A-ms98-a-0033 196.998625 199.458500 yes that's right

sw2936A-ms98-a-0037 226.211000 239.370750 oh i guess we'd almost have to i mean i don't know it just seems to me we'd almost have to change the way we do business in government if we didn't have special interest groups i mean right down to the state and city levels and so on but i was wondering about
sw2936A-ms98-a-0038 239.370750 246.987500 you know i- i was a little bit encouraged although it didn't seem to work out too well in this debacle in the Fall when they last Fall when they
sw2936A-ms98-a-0039 246.987500 257.153625 they they did levy a tax on some of the p[eople]- richer people i mean they increased that bubble tax there i- i was a little encouraged by that because that's another way to cure the deficit is
sw2936A-ms98-a-0040 257.153625 265.498875 by higher taxes nobody wants to pay higher taxes but i mean there's going to be a crisis one of these days that's going to force us to do it anyway
sw2936A-ms98-a-0041 265.498875 268.474375 [silence]
sw2936A-ms98-a-0042 268.474375 270.495250 yeah yeah

sw2936A-ms98-a-0056 309.661375 316.715500 well they pass it on to us [laughter-anyway] [laughter-i] i've never i've never even thought that they that they would absorb [laughter-that]
sw2936A-ms98-a-0057 316.715500 321.777625 [silence]
sw2936A-ms98-a-0058 321.777625 323.313375 yeah
sw2936A-ms98-a-0059 323.313375 325.255375 [silence]
sw2936A-ms98-a-0060 325.255375 336.802000 [laughter] that's right of course it that th[at]- [vocalized-noise] that's again that that issue just like you sited Amory's bill on the bases but i- i don't know i [vocalized-noise] it just seems to me
sw2936A-ms98-a-0061 336.802000 349.198250 that uh i mean i it it does seem to me now that twenty percent i- i think i'm correct in this that twenty percent of the federal budget i[s]- i[s]- is allocated now for debt payments
sw2936A-ms98-a-0062 349.198250 358.303125 or interest payment on the debt but uh yeah and and and i know if i had to pay that much in my out of my salary i mean it it it's
sw2936A-ms98-a-0063 358.303125 368.291500 it it just seems to me i don't know whether it it that's kind of a colloquium just use common sense but i[t]- it just seems like there has to be some there will be a crisis at some point
sw2936A-ms98-a-0064 368.291500 380.717250 when the Medicare programs can't pay off when the wh[en]- when they can't pay off the the the savings and loans uh uh situation when the banks can't be insured any longer when the pensions can't be insured
sw2936A-ms98-a-0065 380.717250 390.971750 then people are really are going to demand something to be done but it appears to me that i don't know if there is any short term or long terms steps without a greater crisis that takes place
sw2936A-ms98-a-0066 390.971750 395.798625 [silence]
sw2936A-ms98-a-0067 395.798625 405.686625 yeah but how do you get people to do that though i mean i- i- i- i- i don't even find myself you know i see i- i play that game with myself sometimes
sw2936A-ms98-a-0068 405.686625 420.182250 i know things are a little tough so i say well i'll just charge this on the credit card and i'll pay it off in a little bit and then then every once in a while i get a shock i get the credit card up to six seven thousand i say this is absolutely insane and we sort of tighten up or something comes by to pay the damn thing off but
sw2936A-ms98-a-0069 420.182250 431.430000 i- i- i- i- i think that we're not paying anything off i mean obviously we're not paying anything off we we've gone from the largest creditor to the largest debtor nation in the last ten years and
sw2936A-ms98-a-0070 431.430000 441.495875 [silence]
sw2936A-ms98-a-0071 441.495875 445.824000 [laughter] yeah that's right
sw2936A-ms98-a-0072 445.824000 447.166875 [silence]
sw2936A-ms98-a-0073 447.166875 454.299750 yeah i saw some Japanese guy on television today he was talking about the the the trade deficit he said
sw2936A-ms98-a-0074 454.299750 462.194750 as lon[g]- it's so it's so simple that that it was it was kind of it was kind of humorous he said as long as you continue to spend
sw2936A-ms98-a-0075 462.194750 465.612250 more than you continue to uh sell
sw2936A-ms98-a-0076 465.612250 479.620500 as long as you continue to buy in your country more than you continue to sell you'll have a trade deficit and until that comes under control uh the lending comes under control that that's your problem well i mean i- i started to laugh at that i mean it seems so simplistic but
sw2936A-ms98-a-0077 479.620500 487.271750 i guess it is the truth we just keep [laughter-buying] [laughter-this] [laughter-stuff] and we don't have the ability apparently to sell our products overseas
sw2936A-ms98-a-0078 487.271750 497.460250 and it is a very complex situation but uh i- i guess but as a as an accountant do you do you find people are worried when you talk to them_1 about what our government might do or
sw2936A-ms98-a-0079 497.460250 504.980375 [silence]
sw2936A-ms98-a-0080 504.980375 508.507000 [vocalized-noise] what they can't seem yes that that that's right
sw2936A-ms98-a-0081 508.507000 519.429000 [silence]
sw2936A-ms98-a-0082 519.429000 532.997625 yeah i was i guess i was a little comforted by the fact that on this Gulf War uh that we have received uh at least sixty percent of the money [laughter] that we asked for and i- i should imagine
sw2936A-ms98-a-0083 532.997625 538.169500 i don't know how that's coming you know i remember some i- i just don't i haven't seen a real accounting of that
sw2936A-ms98-a-0084 538.169500 539.233625 [silence]
sw2936A-ms98-a-0085 539.233625 548.667750 so i guess i guess uh uh if i was to take a position now and sum up because_1 i don't want to talk too long is that the short term i guess we have to
sw2936A-ms98-a-0086 548.667750 559.481375 some how as you say address those issues in the long term we'd either have t[o]- we'd have to raise taxes and cut back on some of the big the transfer payments and the military an and just bite that bullet
sw2936A-ms98-a-0087 559.481375 565.494625 okay i'm going to cut it off and uh because_1 i've got to [laughter-go] nice talking to you Bob bye-bye
sw2936A-ms98-a-0088 565.494625 568.510000 [noise]
