sw2936B-ms98-a-0006 43.680000 51.735875 yeah i believe uh i believe that's right uh i guess uh uh you know really what we've got to do is is face up to the fact that uh
sw2936B-ms98-a-0007 51.735875 59.303625 our economy just will not support uh all of the programs that you know that the the the
sw2936B-ms98-a-0008 59.303625 71.553625 some of the people and i think it's you know the minority numbers not in minorities uh you know i'm not talking racial stuff but minori[ties]- minorities in numbers [noise] uh
sw2936B-ms98-a-0009 71.553625 78.424375 uh want to have passed uh special interest groups uh have you know their own agenda
sw2936B-ms98-a-0010 78.424375 89.496000 and i think that it's time that uh Congress faces up to what i think the the people in general have faced up to is that we just cannot really support all of those things
sw2936B-ms98-a-0011 89.496000 109.744875 [silence]
sw2936B-ms98-a-0012 109.744875 111.586500 right

sw2936B-ms98-a-0014 119.365500 122.294500 right i- i believe that's true
sw2936B-ms98-a-0015 122.294500 132.986000 [silence]
sw2936B-ms98-a-0016 132.986000 144.142000 well i ye[ah]- you know one of the things that i look at uh uh i'm in the Dallas area and uh Dick Armey is Congressman from Texas is one of the the sponsors of the
sw2936B-ms98-a-0017 144.142000 148.743000 the uh bill that's that called for the closing of military bases
sw2936B-ms98-a-0018 148.743000 161.249000 and one of the bases that's being closed or that's on the you know on the agenda to be closed is Carswell Air Force base in Fort Worth which is right you know right close by and when they decided that that was one that needed to be closed
sw2936B-ms98-a-0019 161.249000 167.654875 there was really a a huge cry you know from the Dallas Fort Worth area about you know
sw2936B-ms98-a-0020 167.654875 176.466375 how it's you know that one is the one that should not be closed you know it's it's not fair you know [laughter-to] to Dallas Fort Worth but uh you know when Amory's
sw2936B-ms98-a-0021 176.466375 182.251750 bill passed everybody said hey that's a great thing you know we're going to cut back on some of this unnecessary spending
sw2936B-ms98-a-0022 182.251750 190.474250 right and uh you know i think that's the the same case that that you know would hold true for a number of other programs uh
sw2936B-ms98-a-0023 190.474250 205.188625 we all talk about uh about how the the uh transfer payments you know are not handled correctly uh you know the the welfare programs and s[ome]- and some of those things and you know they all need major overhauls
sw2936B-ms98-a-0024 205.188625 206.428625 but
sw2936B-ms98-a-0025 206.428625 220.242500 they all need major overhauls until they're the ones you know until it's the one that that i sponsored or the one that my state gets the most benefit from or you know the [laughter-one] that that my children or my grandchildren or my mother or grandmother
sw2936B-ms98-a-0026 220.242500 228.608125 you know that we've all we all all got a special interest group that uh you know that's benefiting from some of these uh

sw2936B-ms98-a-0032 263.992875 277.195875 right i- i- i [vocalized-noise] agree with that i i'm an accountant a CPA and i went to a seminar some seminars today and uh one of our opening speaker our keynote speaker this morning
sw2936B-ms98-a-0033 277.195875 288.209125 was is the presid[ent]- of one of the major Texas companies or fairly major anyway and one of his comments had to do with the state taxes [noise] the state
sw2936B-ms98-a-0034 288.209125 299.998000 the state Texas is uh you know is in a little bit of a bind tax wise and one of the proposal is uh to uh have a new state income tax but to have it only on on corporations
sw2936B-ms98-a-0035 299.998000 311.316125 and of course you know he's corporate president corporate uh CEO and uh that was just not the right thing you know [laughter] the the corporations are paying too much tax already so it's you know
sw2936B-ms98-a-0036 311.316125 313.997375 [laughter-right] so the same you know
sw2936B-ms98-a-0037 313.997375 315.684000 [silence]
sw2936B-ms98-a-0038 315.684000 327.278250 right the same you know same thing applies you know if the tax is is geared t[o]- you know or or aimed toward me then it's a bad tax if it's aimed toward you it's a good tax [laughter] yeah

sw2936B-ms98-a-0057 437.249250 449.637625 we as a nation are not prepared to do what we as individuals would do and that's you know we cut off our spending and cut off our charging when our when our credit gets out of hand you know
