sw2993A-ms98-a-0002 1.031250 4.195625 are you in the market for a car recently
sw2993A-ms98-a-0003 4.195625 5.815375 oh what'd you get
sw2993A-ms98-a-0004 5.815375 8.217000 [silence]
sw2993A-ms98-a-0005 8.217000 11.445250 uh-huh what what convinced you to get that one
sw2993A-ms98-a-0006 11.445250 15.304250 [silence]
sw2993A-ms98-a-0007 15.304250 16.897750 um-hum
sw2993A-ms98-a-0008 16.897750 19.586750 oh incredible how many miles on it
sw2993A-ms98-a-0009 19.586750 21.589250 [silence]
sw2993A-ms98-a-0010 21.589250 23.701500 and it's still running real well
sw2993A-ms98-a-0011 23.701500 32.851750 oh great yeah we have um right now we have two cars um i have my husband and myself we have two sons who are drivers
sw2993A-ms98-a-0012 32.851750 45.471625 and one of which is a um an eighty eight Plymouth Voyager Van and then we have um about a year ago we picked up a second hand uh uh Audi
sw2993A-ms98-a-0013 45.471625 52.416125 uh and uh that was a ca[r]- you know a c[ar]- a sedan and uh we got that i don't i'll
sw2993A-ms98-a-0014 52.416125 61.253875 the major things the reason why we got that is we had had a Nova and a well my son was driving and someone came into his lane and hit
sw2993A-ms98-a-0015 61.253875 70.414000 him and fortunately he was able to his i mean he was checked out of the hospital was out of the hospital by that night but the car was completely totaled
sw2993A-ms98-a-0016 70.414000 80.034000 and Mike and they had been my s[ons]- two sons had been a passenger in a car about a year and a half before that which was hit by another car
sw2993A-ms98-a-0017 80.034000 86.535375 so i mean i got i was getting really nervous so i finally said we i want a really solid car
sw2993A-ms98-a-0018 86.535375 96.405375 so we found the Audi second hand i guess right now my criteria for cars is uh uh s[olid]- being solid able to take an [laughter-impact]
sw2993A-ms98-a-0019 96.405375 102.358000 and uh so uh i we're not going to be in the market for in the near future for any new car
sw2993A-ms98-a-0020 102.358000 109.561750 but the the things that i would want would be a solid car another thing i'd definitely want would be antilock brakes
sw2993A-ms98-a-0021 109.561750 119.057125 uh our our van which is a a delight to drive does not have i- i think the brakes on the Plymouth van is just are terrible
sw2993A-ms98-a-0022 119.057125 129.700250 um if the road is at all wet and i'm and i don't go all that fast but the uh it it just doesn't hold it doesn't hold well at all
sw2993A-ms98-a-0023 129.700250 137.339500 so uh i i definitely would want to get antilock brakes so i don't know uh do you have any particular things [laughter-that]
sw2993A-ms98-a-0024 137.339500 140.034875 that are priorities on your list
sw2993A-ms98-a-0025 140.034875 142.784000 [silence]
sw2993A-ms98-a-0026 142.784000 144.098625 yeah
sw2993A-ms98-a-0027 144.098625 145.389750 [silence]
sw2993A-ms98-a-0028 145.389750 148.554125 i guess down there air conditioning's a must isn't it
sw2993A-ms98-a-0029 148.554125 151.325625 [silence]
sw2993A-ms98-a-0030 151.325625 152.572750 uh-huh
sw2993A-ms98-a-0031 152.572750 156.357625 [silence]
sw2993A-ms98-a-0032 156.357625 159.581000 that's incredible that is incredible
sw2993A-ms98-a-0033 159.581000 171.453375 uh we we get about our the uh van gets on highways can get about twenty eight the Audi does not have good mileage that's the one drawback it's a powerful car
sw2993A-ms98-a-0034 171.453375 173.043500 um
sw2993A-ms98-a-0035 173.043500 179.327000 but it does not uh i mean i if i'm on a highway and i can get twenty twenty one miles in per gallon
sw2993A-ms98-a-0036 179.327000 192.189375 i consider that luck[y]- i'm lucky maybe maybe sometimes i've gotten twenty two it comes out around the eighteen or nineteen local driving and that's a to me is a real drawback i wish i would you know i could settle for twenty eight or
sw2993A-ms98-a-0037 192.189375 205.997625 but uh the um the frills on that car are nice but they're not necessary for me except air conditioning in this area uh in Washington DC area it gets hot and humid
sw2993A-ms98-a-0038 205.997625 216.138875 yeah uh so air conditioning is def[initely]- uh definitely a necessity for us through two or three months in the summer um but i um
sw2993A-ms98-a-0039 216.138875 221.610250 i i don't need uh you know power windows are nice but i [laughter-don't] [laughter-need] [laughter-them]
sw2993A-ms98-a-0040 221.610250 233.243500 although i must say when you're driving in the east and there are all these toll roads come into a toll road push that button down it's real nice for that window to zip down and zip up [laughter-instead] [laughter-of] having to crank it
sw2993A-ms98-a-0041 233.243500 245.435250 yeah but or you know if you want to have open windows to be able to op[en]- if you're alone in the car just to press buttons and but you know i've lived all these years without them i probably could have lived a little [laughter-longer]
sw2993A-ms98-a-0042 245.435250 253.389125 uh one of the things that we have uh we've liked when we've gotten a new car and this this used car has it is a sun roof
sw2993A-ms98-a-0043 253.389125 257.327875 and those are really nice i[n]- in good weather
sw2993A-ms98-a-0044 257.327875 265.748750 so uh so i guess if we get a new car it definitely would have to have an[tilock]- antilock brakes i'd love to get uh an air bag
sw2993A-ms98-a-0045 265.748750 268.171875 and a sun roof
sw2993A-ms98-a-0046 268.171875 282.819250 and uh just so it'd be a good solid car i guess that's those are m[y]- my major criteria everything else is you know a luxury and they make the car more expensive but they often add more things to repair when things go wrong
sw2993A-ms98-a-0047 282.819250 288.619000 so uh bu[t]- if you were to buy a new car now a brand new car what would you look for
sw2993A-ms98-a-0048 288.619000 291.371375 [silence]
sw2993A-ms98-a-0049 291.371375 292.626750 um-hum
sw2993A-ms98-a-0050 292.626750 295.460875 [silence]
sw2993A-ms98-a-0051 295.460875 297.157000 yeah yeah
sw2993A-ms98-a-0052 297.157000 303.801125 [silence]
sw2993A-ms98-a-0053 303.801125 306.576500 isn't that true it's it's funny um
sw2993A-ms98-a-0054 306.576500 312.956875 uh that you use uh the Audi's German and i have to say it has been pretty dependable
sw2993A-ms98-a-0055 312.956875 319.870750 yeah sometime[s]- one advantage of an American made car is if you get stuck anywhere most local garages can fix you up
sw2993A-ms98-a-0056 319.870750 331.830000 but once you get if you s[tart]- once you get something fancy you get stuck somewhere off of the main area you can be really and the parts i know the Audi parts are terribly expensive
sw2993A-ms98-a-0057 331.830000 336.867250 i- i mean it ju[st]- i shudder i would not get the Audi again just for that reason
sw2993A-ms98-a-0058 336.867250 343.881125 but i would love i wish an American an American that you know engineering would make something as solid as a German car
sw2993A-ms98-a-0059 343.881125 350.960000 you know we certainly have the technology but it's amazing when we bought this Audi i mean everything is more solid in it
sw2993A-ms98-a-0060 350.960000 354.639125 uh i[t]- you don't feel you've got any of the flabby plastic
sw2993A-ms98-a-0061 354.639125 362.255250 and i know and i i and i'm willing to give up a little bit in the mileage for a for a solid car i don't think i have to give up as much as i'm giving up
sw2993A-ms98-a-0062 362.255250 365.631250 but uh do you need air conditioning down there
sw2993A-ms98-a-0063 365.631250 366.762375 [silence]
sw2993A-ms98-a-0064 366.762375 368.011875 yeah
sw2993A-ms98-a-0065 368.011875 370.603250 [silence]
sw2993A-ms98-a-0066 370.603250 373.512250 oh we've had eleven days in a row over ninety
sw2993A-ms98-a-0067 373.512250 376.923750 they've in fact had to excuse school down here because of that
