sw2925B-ms98-a-0002 1.022125 2.591500 okay
sw2925B-ms98-a-0003 2.591500 4.632250 well what do you think about gun [laughter-control]
sw2925B-ms98-a-0004 4.632250 14.361000 [silence]
sw2925B-ms98-a-0005 14.361000 16.460125 yeah
sw2925B-ms98-a-0006 16.460125 31.162875 [silence]
sw2925B-ms98-a-0007 31.162875 35.544125 i wouldn't be f[or]- against control if it
sw2925B-ms98-a-0008 35.544125 39.614750 made it virtually impossible for even criminals to get them
sw2925B-ms98-a-0009 39.614750 48.773375 that's the problem is when you when you you know you take it away from the people who don't intend to ever use them for for a violent crime other than hunting and things like that
sw2925B-ms98-a-0010 48.773375 61.780750 and the criminals can always continue to get the guns regardless they can get them_1 through the black market or whatever so i'm not sure if gun control in it's true sense that they're trying to implement it will ever work
sw2925B-ms98-a-0011 61.780750 66.658500 [silence]
sw2925B-ms98-a-0012 66.658500 68.092250 um-hum

sw2925B-ms98-a-0014 95.624500 110.351250 yeah i think you know if it when it came down to these uh what i what i would consider militant type guns assault rifles and you know hand guns because_1 i'm i'm not i'm not a real advocate of hand guns i- i mean i do i do own one
sw2925B-ms98-a-0015 110.351250 114.925875 but i own it for protection i know how to use it i know when not to use it
sw2925B-ms98-a-0016 114.925875 118.350875 i think for the person that's inexperienced has no business with one
sw2925B-ms98-a-0017 118.350875 119.912625 uh
sw2925B-ms98-a-0018 119.912625 121.426375 yeah

sw2925B-ms98-a-0024 144.389250 150.690875 well the reason i say we were uh we personally have experienced a major crime in our family
sw2925B-ms98-a-0025 150.690875 153.679375 and uh you know with my wife and daughter
sw2925B-ms98-a-0026 153.679375 155.149375 they were kidnapped
sw2925B-ms98-a-0027 155.149375 156.434500 and
sw2925B-ms98-a-0028 156.434500 159.428625 you know and and it's really made me look differently
sw2925B-ms98-a-0029 159.428625 167.738125 at the way it is you know and uh i'm not saying that i if i'd had a gun i could have done you know anything because_1 i- i really wasn't even there it happened while i was away but
sw2925B-ms98-a-0030 167.738125 182.266250 but i think there are certain cases where it could get you in trouble you have to be able to know when it when it can and when it can't if it came in the middle of the night where if i could get my hands on it and do something with it that's one thing uh
sw2925B-ms98-a-0031 182.266250 207.179750 [silence]
sw2925B-ms98-a-0032 207.179750 210.831750 that's all right

sw2925B-ms98-a-0034 212.270750 221.974625 well i've kind of got pros and cons about both there there there there's good things and bad things and there's there's a lot of details that you you know it's hard to work out all the details
sw2925B-ms98-a-0035 221.974625 244.450000 [silence]
sw2925B-ms98-a-0036 244.450000 255.696500 yeah i assure you it it can it can and and the chances you know because_1 we've been through a lot of the the court battles and all this other stuff over the years because_1 they're behind bars now but
sw2925B-ms98-a-0037 255.696500 261.317750 but they won't be there long and and we we've had to deal you know we've had to deal with a lot of that and
sw2925B-ms98-a-0038 261.317750 272.846250 the the frightening thing is and and i can i can tell you from you know just statistics and and from even other people i've talked with your chances is one is actually one in three right now
sw2925B-ms98-a-0039 272.846250 282.510750 one out of every third person is has and i'm talking about a major crime committed against them_1 now it's one out of every four or five for just a a crime
sw2925B-ms98-a-0040 282.510750 285.451000 whether it be just normal robbery or whatever

sw2925B-ms98-a-0044 308.252500 314.102125 well actually [vocalized-noise] th[e]- a a higher fence is less is more of a security risk
sw2925B-ms98-a-0045 314.102125 317.931500 than a normal average six foot fence did you know that
sw2925B-ms98-a-0046 317.931500 320.296750 yeah we thought because_1 we had an eight foot fence
sw2925B-ms98-a-0047 320.296750 324.471625 the problem is they can get behind it and they can do a lot behind an eight foot fence
sw2925B-ms98-a-0048 324.471625 325.497500 [silence]
sw2925B-ms98-a-0049 325.497500 328.342250 that they can't do behind a normal fence
sw2925B-ms98-a-0050 328.342250 334.327625 um in fact they say it's actually it's you're actually more secure if you have no fence at all

sw2925B-ms98-a-0058 354.928000 359.747375 and you know they they physically were not harmed in any way they were very lucky
sw2925B-ms98-a-0059 359.747375 369.266500 and and knowing the guy and his record his normal motif is to kill them_1 he just he just happened not to he put them in the trunk of her car and drove them out and left them_1

sw2925B-ms98-a-0064 381.102125 390.901000 one he's one person but he's he's used them not maybe necessarily killed them but that's his normal style i mean that that's what he would do in a in a confronted situation
sw2925B-ms98-a-0065 390.901000 395.347625 uh you know he's he's been it's been proven that he that he's not uh
sw2925B-ms98-a-0066 395.347625 397.388375 society material
sw2925B-ms98-a-0067 397.388375 403.975500 but yet you know he'll like i say he'll be back out on the street just because of this this new you know uh
sw2925B-ms98-a-0068 403.975500 411.826375 yeah there's no prison space but you know you you come to the point where you have to [vocalized-noise] you have to say either they're rehabilitatable or not

sw2925B-ms98-a-0070 413.157750 418.235375 uh you know and those that they that they that that clinically are nuts and out of their minds
sw2925B-ms98-a-0071 418.235375 428.293125 or those who have committed a murder who are who will do it again because_1 they've they've said you know when a person's murdered somebody out of cold blood the chances are they would do it again because they feel no remorse
sw2925B-ms98-a-0072 428.293125 433.156625 they need and i and i and i hate to say this because_1 i know it sounds awfully bad but they need to eliminate them_1
sw2925B-ms98-a-0073 433.156625 435.431625 they need to get them_1 out of society

sw2925B-ms98-a-0078 478.107750 483.903250 i- i mean i've i've heard of you know similar programs but to me i mean if
sw2925B-ms98-a-0079 483.903250 488.988125 i- and i you know and again i hate to say this but had they had they really hurt my family
sw2925B-ms98-a-0080 488.988125 490.486250 or whatever
sw2925B-ms98-a-0081 490.486250 493.284750 i would have stopped at nothing to ensure they were dead
sw2925B-ms98-a-0082 493.284750 506.070875 i and that and and i hate to say that but i- i mean it's it's just you they they violate your family of course at that point you don't have much to lose and i ha[te]- and i- like i said i really hate to say that but i think that i would be that uh taken buy it

sw2925B-ms98-a-0088 525.515000 532.959375 but the victims are the ones that are the cr[iminals]- are made the criminals i mean they're the ones that that end up hurting the worst
sw2925B-ms98-a-0089 532.959375 544.180500 and that that's really a shame but as far you know but as far as gun control goes i think that there n[eeds]- there definitely needs to be some measures taken because_1 not everybody's capable of own[ing]- of owning and and taking care of a weapon
sw2925B-ms98-a-0090 544.180500 545.518500 and

sw2925B-ms98-a-0098 569.795875 573.778625 to help themselves some they have by being extra careful
sw2925B-ms98-a-0099 573.778625 578.751875 uh by you know by knowing the signs of a cr[ime]- of a crime beginning to happen or whatever
