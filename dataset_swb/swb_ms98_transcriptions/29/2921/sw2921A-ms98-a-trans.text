sw2921A-ms98-a-0105 440.443875 454.207750 that's yeah a really good friend of mine lives in Penn Hills and they've been in their house oh probably about twelve years now and um it's it's you know they're going to start to see their return on their investment very soon um but it's a beautiful home and
sw2921A-ms98-a-0106 454.207750 463.002750 i mean my brother lives is it called Baldwin or Bebble i mean he lives all in that same area going from Mount Lebanon um it's real pretty up there it's just
sw2921A-ms98-a-0107 463.002750 471.410625 and the neighborhoods are stable you know it's uh when you come to this part of the country we've been away from Dallas long enough that you see the difference in [laughter-housing]
sw2921A-ms98-a-0108 471.410625 477.564500 [silence]

sw2921A-ms98-a-0113 484.764625 499.688125 [laughter] that's what it is here yeah that's why we're at a point now we've uh we're adopting and we have been married ten plus years and what happens is uh you just realize that once you get to a certain age the next house that you get [noise] we'll be staying in [laughter] so
sw2921A-ms98-a-0114 499.688125 513.672750 yeah that's kind of like where we're so we're considering Pennsylvania and we're just kind of you know toying with what exactly where we want to be you know a lot of people say it doesn't matter where they live if they have a nice house and but i disagree with that i
sw2921A-ms98-a-0115 513.672750 515.754125 [silence]
sw2921A-ms98-a-0116 515.754125 517.166250 uh-huh

sw2921A-ms98-a-0118 519.661875 529.368375 i know and it and the economy here in Dallas i mean it it's steady but it's still not going up and i um i just refuse to buy it um if i know i'm not going to be there for at least
sw2921A-ms98-a-0119 529.368375 531.745500 five years uh you you know
sw2921A-ms98-a-0120 531.745500 533.147000 [silence]
sw2921A-ms98-a-0121 533.147000 544.086500 oh i'm sure yeah there i mean you can go down a street and here he told you this every other house you know if it's been foreclosed on or you know even big executives um
sw2921A-ms98-a-0122 544.086500 550.704375 it's really i mean a and and it's hard to sell the properties people from JC Penney's from New York came here about a couple of years ago
sw2921A-ms98-a-0123 550.704375 559.965000 and they thought they were getting a great deal um because they could get a five hundred thousand dollar home with they call it zero lot lines no property Jean
sw2921A-ms98-a-0124 559.965000 562.292250 and it would make you ill to see this [laughter]
sw2921A-ms98-a-0125 562.292250 568.886750 i mean it would probably be like your house on uh you know a half a city block in Pittsburgh or something
sw2921A-ms98-a-0126 568.886750 579.799875 yeah i know and that's you know like i can look outside right now and look into the next unit you know it's across the way and it's landscaped and all that with azaleas but it's still it's still not that private
sw2921A-ms98-a-0127 579.799875 585.064875 [silence]
sw2921A-ms98-a-0128 585.064875 588.171625 yeah but you have a rider

sw2921A-ms98-a-0130 591.915250 599.013750 no and your kids have to tell you the truth um i think that if you can keep that that way you know kind of like a homestead i hate
