sw2999A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.252750 [noise]
sw2999A-ms98-a-0002 1.252750 3.572125 hi d[o]- do you have lots of credit [laughter-cards]
sw2999A-ms98-a-0003 3.572125 9.317375 [silence]
sw2999A-ms98-a-0004 9.317375 10.518000 uh-huh
sw2999A-ms98-a-0005 10.518000 19.582875 [silence]
sw2999A-ms98-a-0006 19.582875 32.563875 um i used to have a ton of gas credit cards and now i have one or two of them_1 but i think i've even let some of them expire but i was living out of the country for a while so i wasn't using them too much and i don't drive that much but i have
sw2999A-ms98-a-0007 32.563875 43.529125 you know MasterCard and Visa and you know i have a MasterCard and an American Express now i got rid of the Visa because_1 it was getting out of hand having fifteen [laughter-million] cards but as long as like my
sw2999A-ms98-a-0008 43.529125 53.959875 MasterCard is um free as long as you spend about i don't know three thousand dollars a year or something like that and so i tend to buy almost all major purchases on a credit card when i have the choice
sw2999A-ms98-a-0009 53.959875 60.985875 and um i used to even use it for my grocery shopping and stuff the stores around here don't let you do it too much
sw2999A-ms98-a-0010 60.985875 67.776000 and so i don't but i was living in France and there you pay for everything by credit card b[ut]- it's not really a credit card
sw2999A-ms98-a-0011 67.776000 70.338625 it's a i[t]- it's a debit card yeah
sw2999A-ms98-a-0012 70.338625 82.720750 and um just you know it's [vocalized-noise] many times you get out of the store faster if you pay with that than if you pay with cash <b_aside> bye thanks <e_aside> um yeah because they're just so well set up with it [laughter]
sw2999A-ms98-a-0013 82.720750 89.251625 [silence]
sw2999A-ms98-a-0014 89.251625 90.554250 right well
sw2999A-ms98-a-0015 90.554250 91.889000 [silence]
sw2999A-ms98-a-0016 91.889000 96.639250 yeah i- i never pay finance charges on them except when i screw up which i [laughter-occasionally] do
sw2999A-ms98-a-0017 96.639250 104.362375 and you know i'll forget to pay the bill by the due date or this last month i mailed the check to them on the twenty second and they didn't get it until the thirtieth and it was due the twenty fifth
sw2999A-ms98-a-0018 104.362375 105.503875 and
sw2999A-ms98-a-0019 105.503875 110.845000 yeah so i thought i and so i got hit up with a cre[dit]- uh finance charge on it which pissed me off
sw2999A-ms98-a-0020 110.845000 112.817375 because um
sw2999A-ms98-a-0021 112.817375 115.379875 you know i really did mail it in time
sw2999A-ms98-a-0022 115.379875 116.522125 but
sw2999A-ms98-a-0023 116.522125 121.481250 they have no proof of that i don't i don't want to i'll probably talk to them some more discuss it but i- i never um
sw2999A-ms98-a-0024 121.481250 123.954875 usually never [laughter-pay] finance charges
sw2999A-ms98-a-0025 123.954875 124.953250 [laughter]
sw2999A-ms98-a-0026 124.953250 129.849625 [silence]
sw2999A-ms98-a-0027 129.849625 132.536750 i had that hassle one time and
sw2999A-ms98-a-0028 132.536750 137.727000 i that went on for months and months and months because and they eventually found the check and
sw2999A-ms98-a-0029 137.727000 147.962750 deposited it and months later they were still telling me that i owed them finance charges and um late fees and things like that and i said well i mailed you a check and you eventually did deposit it
sw2999A-ms98-a-0030 147.962750 150.503250 so you know
sw2999A-ms98-a-0031 150.503250 154.226125 i guess i don't know who the the burden of proof is on
sw2999A-ms98-a-0032 154.226125 155.850625 you know it's kind of a
sw2999A-ms98-a-0033 155.850625 159.991500 because you never d[o]- when i pay bills i don't make a Xerox copy of it or i don't
sw2999A-ms98-a-0034 159.991500 161.433500 um
sw2999A-ms98-a-0035 161.433500 166.985500 right or i don't get a i don't mail them all a signed receipt whatever i you know at the bank
sw2999A-ms98-a-0036 166.985500 169.031250 to have a proof of when i mailed it
sw2999A-ms98-a-0037 169.031250 171.570000 and i mean you can't do that it'd be ridiculous
sw2999A-ms98-a-0038 171.570000 178.963875 [silence]
sw2999A-ms98-a-0039 178.963875 179.977000 right
sw2999A-ms98-a-0040 179.977000 181.029125 [silence]
sw2999A-ms98-a-0041 181.029125 181.938875 well you can
sw2999A-ms98-a-0042 181.938875 185.563875 [silence]
sw2999A-ms98-a-0043 185.563875 193.133375 right or i returned it so don't charge it yeah well that's basically what happened with us is we bought a computer and the computer um
sw2999A-ms98-a-0044 193.133375 196.186250 d[idn't]- wasn't didn't do what
sw2999A-ms98-a-0045 196.186250 202.672625 these people said it would do we need to just put external cards in and it wouldn't do that so he brought it back to them and they're supposed to modify it
sw2999A-ms98-a-0046 202.672625 208.815625 and so i called the credit card company and said well we haven't really taken possession because it's not useful for us we can't use it
sw2999A-ms98-a-0047 208.815625 212.061750 and then they said well then don't pay it
sw2999A-ms98-a-0048 212.061750 224.920625 and then a month later i had to dispute it in writing and i was out of the country and got back and i took care of it as soo[n]- as soon as we got the computer back and it was okay i mailed off a check but then it was too late so now they're hitting [vocalized-noise] [laughter] with a finance charge
sw2999A-ms98-a-0049 224.920625 227.346000 but it's sort of you know it's it's half our fault
sw2999A-ms98-a-0050 227.346000 228.983125 and so w[e]-
sw2999A-ms98-a-0051 228.983125 230.356000 [silence]
sw2999A-ms98-a-0052 230.356000 234.251000 right if i'd filed the letter to dispute it and then paid it eventually it would have been okay
sw2999A-ms98-a-0053 234.251000 236.354375 so i learned that for the next time
sw2999A-ms98-a-0054 236.354375 237.536375 yeah
sw2999A-ms98-a-0055 237.536375 244.416625 [silence]
sw2999A-ms98-a-0056 244.416625 245.506750 uh-huh
sw2999A-ms98-a-0057 245.506750 247.781500 [silence]
sw2999A-ms98-a-0058 247.781500 249.397000 right yeah
sw2999A-ms98-a-0059 249.397000 261.483875 [silence]
sw2999A-ms98-a-0060 261.483875 262.847750 yeah
sw2999A-ms98-a-0061 262.847750 264.201500 [silence]
sw2999A-ms98-a-0062 264.201500 271.505750 well my husband and i both have that and i don't know what we pay for his card i pay i think i have a gold one so i think it's like seventy five dollars for me
sw2999A-ms98-a-0063 271.505750 275.807000 and i'm not quite sure what it is for him but i had really like [vocalized-noise]
sw2999A-ms98-a-0064 275.807000 277.057625 there
sw2999A-ms98-a-0065 277.057625 284.458375 nowadays i'm not su[re]- so sure that it's worth it but um in the past there you know there are some places that only take American Express
sw2999A-ms98-a-0066 284.458375 285.715000 and then
sw2999A-ms98-a-0067 285.715000 291.555500 they don't have the credit limit because i've over done the credit limit on the other card if my husband and i both travel
sw2999A-ms98-a-0068 291.555500 296.436000 if it you know a couple of plane tickets and a little bit more and you're over the limit on the credit card
sw2999A-ms98-a-0069 296.436000 298.429875 and um
sw2999A-ms98-a-0070 298.429875 305.278250 with the American Express they say there is no limit there really is but they tell you that but then that was one advantage but th[at's]- that's like
sw2999A-ms98-a-0071 305.278250 308.474125 i don't i think it's seventy five dollars for me and forty for him
sw2999A-ms98-a-0072 308.474125 309.955500 for a year which is a lot
sw2999A-ms98-a-0073 309.955500 310.987750 [silence]
sw2999A-ms98-a-0074 310.987750 312.349125 be [vocalized-noise]
sw2999A-ms98-a-0075 312.349125 316.049875 [silence]
sw2999A-ms98-a-0076 316.049875 325.409250 yeah well we should probably get another um Visa card yeah one another one that's free because there are some like i think AT&T has one that's free if you make two purchases a year
sw2999A-ms98-a-0077 325.409250 326.427250 well so
sw2999A-ms98-a-0078 326.427250 327.572500 [silence]
sw2999A-ms98-a-0079 327.572500 335.572375 yeah and so that's easy enough to do and if that's true that's um i[t]- it might be better off to have that as a second card just to have the credit
sw2999A-ms98-a-0080 335.572375 339.186500 and get rid of the American Express because it costs so much
sw2999A-ms98-a-0081 339.186500 342.860750 [silence]
sw2999A-ms98-a-0082 342.860750 344.103375 no
sw2999A-ms98-a-0083 344.103375 345.312500 no
sw2999A-ms98-a-0084 345.312500 350.491875 i and i don't under[stand]- i mean i guess i do understand the mentality of people doing it but i don't understand
sw2999A-ms98-a-0085 350.491875 351.696875 [silence]
sw2999A-ms98-a-0086 351.696875 361.489875 yeah because people think it doesn't really cost them anything to pay i have had months where i was shocked at how much had come in because like i thought i would buy a big expense and think that it would take one or two months to process
sw2999A-ms98-a-0087 361.489875 365.697500 and sometimes it comes in right away and it's like oh well i [laughter-guess] i have to pay that too
sw2999A-ms98-a-0088 365.697500 376.580000 because_1 yesterday like many times i'll tr[y]- i'll buy some things towards the end of the month thinking hey i won't get that bill until the next bill not this bill and it'll come in on the next one you have to pay for it right away anyway
sw2999A-ms98-a-0089 376.580000 381.213250 but sometimes the [vocalized-noise] is long like i've had things that i didn't get billed on for two or three months
sw2999A-ms98-a-0090 381.213250 384.857125 [silence]
sw2999A-ms98-a-0091 384.857125 385.867625 yeah
sw2999A-ms98-a-0092 385.867625 390.526875 [silence]
sw2999A-ms98-a-0093 390.526875 398.150250 immediately yeah but that's what happened with us like we bought a washing [laughter-machine] [laughter-seven] months ago and then i got billed like the next [laughter-day]
sw2999A-ms98-a-0094 398.150250 407.945125 it didn't matter because we couldn't have paid for it by check but we prefer [vocalized-noise] like with the credit card you get the automatic um one year guarantee so if something breaks things like that
sw2999A-ms98-a-0095 407.945125 410.807625 you can uh return it so like the washing machine
sw2999A-ms98-a-0096 410.807625 413.581250 we bought it in October and
sw2999A-ms98-a-0097 413.581250 414.658875 [silence]
sw2999A-ms98-a-0098 414.658875 420.350125 you know if something goes wrong with it within the first year we've got an automatic guarantee on it besides the manufacturer's guarantee
sw2999A-ms98-a-0099 420.350125 422.866000 and somethings like that are
sw2999A-ms98-a-0100 422.866000 425.372625 [silence]
sw2999A-ms98-a-0101 425.372625 426.736625 right
sw2999A-ms98-a-0102 426.736625 441.651000 or if it gets stolen or if you lose it or whatever it might be and so so that's you know another advantage and then even things like airline tickets you automatically get flight insurance which um you hopefully you never use but like if your bagga[ge]- but things like if your baggage gets lost
sw2999A-ms98-a-0103 441.651000 443.407750 you get money for that
sw2999A-ms98-a-0104 443.407750 445.549000 to buy new bags and things like that
sw2999A-ms98-a-0105 445.549000 449.698875 and yeah when you rent a car you get that and sometimes you get discounts with the cards and so
