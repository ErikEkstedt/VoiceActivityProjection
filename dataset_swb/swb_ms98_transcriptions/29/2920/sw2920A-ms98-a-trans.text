sw2920A-ms98-a-0039 137.096000 140.203875 yeah that's that's pretty much i think nationwide it's
sw2920A-ms98-a-0040 140.203875 149.004125 you know the average is about seventy five percent uh complete school you know twenty five percent dropout rate throughout the country
sw2920A-ms98-a-0041 149.004125 156.563750 for school districts i'm not sure how they figure that out if they do per pupil or if they look at just averages per school district and things like that
sw2920A-ms98-a-0042 156.563750 161.853625 but some schools i- i don't know see i- i live in a small community [noise] and um
sw2920A-ms98-a-0043 161.853625 165.628500 we don't pay much in taxes i don't uh this sets
sw2920A-ms98-a-0044 165.628500 172.468250 this is a farming community and the farmers control your property taxes basically and and in a sense you services
sw2920A-ms98-a-0045 172.468250 175.990500 we have uh probably what's considered the third worst
sw2920A-ms98-a-0046 175.990500 178.819750 maybe the fourth worst school district in uh
sw2920A-ms98-a-0047 178.819750 180.867750 in the in the state
sw2920A-ms98-a-0048 180.867750 191.917000 other than the city of Baltimore itself probably you know which is always i guess a low is a low streak so actually i think for the return on my taxes for my f[or]- my
sw2920A-ms98-a-0049 191.917000 198.532875 my uh state taxes that go to my school district and my services or whatever i think i get a pretty good return
sw2920A-ms98-a-0050 198.532875 203.650875 but my employment tax you know the federal i don't think i get a good federal
sw2920A-ms98-a-0051 203.650875 209.010250 return at all i think locally i think property taxes on my house were twelve hundred dollars
sw2920A-ms98-a-0052 209.010250 221.746250 and that was that included state and local taxes so that was school district and snow plowing which isn't probably anything like that you have and that included my water and sewer
sw2920A-ms98-a-0053 221.746250 224.694750 um but i didn't think that was too bad

sw2920A-ms98-a-0101 358.596125 367.890750 you know after Desert Storm or whatever we have a plant here that feeds one of the military contracts that should be cut you know that they advised on cutting
sw2920A-ms98-a-0102 367.890750 377.362250 but because of Desert Storm now they said well we can't cut it so they put it back in action now granted everybody around here was happy because it keeps two or three hundred people employed
sw2920A-ms98-a-0103 377.362250 390.161250 but you know if we don't cut some of these nationwide you know some of these expenses just have to be cut if we don't need such a large army and we don't need if the military comes out and says we don't need all these planes
sw2920A-ms98-a-0104 390.161250 393.323250 then why does Congress say tough take them anyway

sw2920A-ms98-a-0151 578.681875 580.813625 uh within was in the City of Pittsburgh
sw2920A-ms98-a-0152 580.813625 591.801250 and there a[re]- yeah because see they Eisenhower put through money for uh though it probably didn't affect Boston it went th[e]- uh a highway from New Jersey west
