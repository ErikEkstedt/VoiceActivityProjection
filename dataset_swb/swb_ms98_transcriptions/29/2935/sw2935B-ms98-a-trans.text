sw2935B-ms98-a-0003 2.386625 7.515000 well we've tried having let me turn the TV off we've tried having uh
sw2935B-ms98-a-0004 7.515000 17.549750 vegetable garden and i'm from Chicago and the way that uh b[ug]- bugs and weeds grow down here is very [laughter-different] [laughter-from] [laughter-Chicago]
sw2935B-ms98-a-0005 17.549750 27.815625 and we have tried several years in a row and we've given up between the fire ants the pill bugs the weeds the drought and a hundred and ten degree heat all Summer and we just kind of uh
sw2935B-ms98-a-0006 27.815625 32.512750 decided to go with a few flowers [laughter-and] [laughter-give] [laughter-up] [laughter-on] [laughter-the] [laughter-vegetable] [laughter-garden]
sw2935B-ms98-a-0007 32.512750 37.266375 we had to put so much poison out on everything that we thought who'd want to eat that stuff
sw2935B-ms98-a-0008 37.266375 48.945500 you know so we have really been frustrated by our gardening attempts here and uh if you really water a lot you can do it but you know when you have to pay for water it really gets to be an annoyance to have to water constantly
sw2935B-ms98-a-0009 48.945500 59.994250 so right now we're just yeah we we just try to maintain the [laughter-lawn] [laughter-and] [laughter-the] [laughter-shrubs] [laughter-right] [laughter-now] [laughter-and] [laughter-the] [laughter-trees] [laughter] we have a peach tree that's the extent of our um contributing to our food supply
sw2935B-ms98-a-0010 59.994250 65.042500 but that's nice to have but yeah yeah so what do you do up there
sw2935B-ms98-a-0011 65.042500 69.218000 [silence]
sw2935B-ms98-a-0012 69.218000 70.642500 um
sw2935B-ms98-a-0013 70.642500 73.709625 [silence]

sw2935B-ms98-a-0023 99.777125 102.556375 if you don't have a frost you'll be all [laughter-right]
sw2935B-ms98-a-0024 102.556375 105.080625 [laughter]
sw2935B-ms98-a-0025 105.080625 111.827250 that's what i remember from living up north is that you'd get everything set and then you'd have a frost and half [laughter-the] [laughter-stuff] [laughter-would] [laughter-get] [laughter-frostbitten] [laughter-and] [laughter-you'd] [laughter-have] [laughter-to]
sw2935B-ms98-a-0026 111.827250 122.638875 [silence]
sw2935B-ms98-a-0027 122.638875 125.599000 wow uh-huh
sw2935B-ms98-a-0028 125.599000 126.871500 [silence]

sw2935B-ms98-a-0030 130.322875 135.565250 [silence]
sw2935B-ms98-a-0031 135.565250 139.633875 oh yeah my husband does that thank goodness because i that's not a pleasure for me [laughter]
sw2935B-ms98-a-0032 139.633875 141.511750 [laughter]
sw2935B-ms98-a-0033 141.511750 143.298750 [laughter]
sw2935B-ms98-a-0034 143.298750 148.456750 i love gardens that are well tended and i just there's been a few different places i've lived where i've just
sw2935B-ms98-a-0035 148.456750 160.951000 [vocalized-noise] there i don't know whether it's little old ladies living there or what but you could just tell that they had a love uh a love affair with their gardens with beautiful wild flowers and just i love the host of colors that just keep coming all you know year long 
sw2935B-ms98-a-0036 160.951000 171.438750 [noise] and uh i- i was in England once and that's one thing that impressed me so much is no matter what size yard somebody had they had a beautiful garden in it you know it could be three feet by four feet or something
sw2935B-ms98-a-0037 171.438750 178.057625 so i do admire that but i haven't really put uh too much energy [laughter-into] [laughter-it] course we have two little [laughter-kids]
sw2935B-ms98-a-0038 178.057625 180.091375 [laughter-are] [laughter-two] [laughter-and] [laughter-three] [laughter-years] [laughter-old] [laughter-so]
sw2935B-ms98-a-0039 180.091375 184.580875 that has put a crimp in my every activity other than diapers and laundry i'll [laughter-tell] [laughter-you] [laughter] 
sw2935B-ms98-a-0040 184.580875 191.172250 [laughter]
sw2935B-ms98-a-0041 191.172250 194.624000 tha[t]- yeah that's really lovely i would love to have different fruit trees
sw2935B-ms98-a-0042 194.624000 207.936125 it's it's been wonderful to have the peaches they're just delicious and we we ha[ve]- we have still have to spray some but we don't have to just a[sphyxiate]- asphyxiate ourself with the poison which is good because_1 [laughter-i] [laughter-just] [laughter-i] [laughter-can't] [laughter-see] [laughter-the] [laughter-point] [laughter-in] [laughter-doing] [laughter-that] and eating anything out of it afterwards
sw2935B-ms98-a-0043 207.936125 210.047375 [silence]
sw2935B-ms98-a-0044 210.047375 218.307625 um we've tried them_1 but again it's just like the sun scorch we've tried them in kind of halfway in the shade and halfway in the s[un]- i mean it's just
sw2935B-ms98-a-0045 218.307625 225.289625 see you really really have to be prepared to water constantly during the Summer people that have been successful out here have done this drip irrigation
sw2935B-ms98-a-0046 225.289625 231.358625 and installed that and um that's really what makes the most sense because_1 you don't have to use so much water and
sw2935B-ms98-a-0047 231.358625 236.914125 it really does the job but it's just amazing how hot and dry and for how long it gets out here and 
sw2935B-ms98-a-0048 236.914125 246.428750 if you're not really committed to it i mean me i'm you know i'm real committed to it for about a week and then i forget about it for a week and then i go oh yeah [laughter-i] [laughter-need] [laughter-to] [laughter-do] [laughter-something] [laughter-and] [laughter-by] [laughter-then] [laughter-it's] [laughter-burned] [laughter-up] [laughter-you] [laughter-know] [laughter] 
sw2935B-ms98-a-0049 246.428750 252.965250 it's just too distracting right now with these little ones in our lives so maybe when i get older i'll find uh some joy in that
sw2935B-ms98-a-0050 252.965250 254.102750 [laughter]
sw2935B-ms98-a-0051 254.102750 256.238750 [silence]
sw2935B-ms98-a-0052 256.238750 257.819375 yeah
sw2935B-ms98-a-0053 257.819375 259.280375 [silence]
sw2935B-ms98-a-0054 259.280375 264.674125 yeah it just gets so hot so fast here we don't have really a Spring or a Fall and it just um
sw2935B-ms98-a-0055 264.674125 269.151875 immediately heats up so that's one thing i miss about living up north as i remember
sw2935B-ms98-a-0056 269.151875 274.433625 um you know the long Springs and long Falls and the cooler weather you know it was really nice
sw2935B-ms98-a-0057 274.433625 279.672250 we always had gardens when i was uh living in Chicago in fact my mother once tore up our entire back yard [laughter]
sw2935B-ms98-a-0058 279.672250 280.461125 [laughter]
sw2935B-ms98-a-0059 280.461125 290.200875 [laughter-and] [laughter-redid] [laughter-it] [laughter-i'll] [laughter-never] [laughter-forget] got my stepfather to put in uh a waterfall and a little pond in one corner i mean that was like the most energy invested in anything [laughter-in] [laughter-the] [laughter-whole] [laughter-time] [laughter-i] [laughter-ever] [laughter-knew] [laughter-him] [laughter]
sw2935B-ms98-a-0060 290.200875 297.760375 [noise] they remodeled the entire back yard then they sold the house and got divorced so i don't know [laughter-what] [laughter-that] [laughter-says] [laughter-about] [laughter-it] [laughter-all] [laughter]
sw2935B-ms98-a-0061 297.760375 301.067250 oh but she used to love to do stuff like that
sw2935B-ms98-a-0062 301.067250 302.512125 [silence]
sw2935B-ms98-a-0063 302.512125 305.387750 yeah it really was i enjoyed it there
sw2935B-ms98-a-0064 305.387750 312.399000 but maybe when the boys get a little older we'll do some more planting because_1 they like to see things grow they've done a couple of little seed projects and
sw2935B-ms98-a-0065 312.399000 314.599875 so i think it will be fun for them
sw2935B-ms98-a-0066 314.599875 316.636500 yeah yeah
sw2935B-ms98-a-0067 316.636500 319.050125 [silence]
sw2935B-ms98-a-0068 319.050125 322.741125 oh yes [laughter] [laughter-they're] [laughter-both] [laughter-running] around now
sw2935B-ms98-a-0069 322.741125 326.288000 [silence]
sw2935B-ms98-a-0070 326.288000 331.317625 yeah well it's very therapeutic i think really to get out there and dig in the dirt you know
sw2935B-ms98-a-0071 331.317625 333.975000 they certainly enjoy [laughter-that] [laughter-part] [laughter-of] [laughter-it] [laughter]
sw2935B-ms98-a-0072 333.975000 340.251625 it's just trying to keep anything i planted bulbs last uh Fall on the side guard and when [laughter-i] [laughter-went] [laughter-out] [laughter-there] [laughter-in] [laughter-the] [laughter-Spring] and 
sw2935B-ms98-a-0073 340.251625 345.796875 the first day they came out the little one went and pulled all the flowers off and the flower petals were scattered [laughter-all] [laughter-over] [laughter-the] [laughter-walk] 
sw2935B-ms98-a-0074 345.796875 350.508375 [laughter-he] [laughter-thought] [laughter-what] [laughter-are] [laughter-these] [laughter-fun] [laughter-toys] [laughter-that] [laughter-mommy] [laughter-put] [laughter-out] [laughter-here] [laughter-with] [laughter-all] [laughter-these] [laughter-colors] [laughter-for] [laughter-me] [laughter-to] [laughter-play] [laughter-with]
sw2935B-ms98-a-0075 350.508375 354.156000 we use to didn't eat them_1 i mean i guess i could be thankful for that
sw2935B-ms98-a-0076 354.156000 355.632750 [laughter]
sw2935B-ms98-a-0077 355.632750 359.445875 [laughter-yeah] [laughter-really] [laughter-if] [laughter-they] [laughter-survive] [laughter-this] [laughter-year]
