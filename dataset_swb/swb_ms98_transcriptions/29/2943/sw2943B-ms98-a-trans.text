sw2943B-ms98-a-0014 30.748375 34.343625 uh it's been the situation where i had to
sw2943B-ms98-a-0015 34.343625 37.742000 put my own children in child care thank goodness
sw2943B-ms98-a-0016 37.742000 39.062500 [silence]

sw2943B-ms98-a-0023 50.191875 58.198875 but it has been a a factor my youngest is now in a uh a preschool which is different than

sw2943B-ms98-a-0025 59.413625 62.443625 day care i guess you know per say

sw2943B-ms98-a-0031 99.711250 102.903250 oh it's very hard it's very hard
sw2943B-ms98-a-0032 102.903250 108.315750 i always felt like i ran a real tip top in home
sw2943B-ms98-a-0033 108.315750 119.857375 child care i think there are advantages to to child care in the home but oh i'd be very very careful if i were putting my own children in a home
sw2943B-ms98-a-0034 119.857375 129.854500 they uh and even if you get a place that's just perfect just perfect you know it's clean and the people are responsible and and the uh
sw2943B-ms98-a-0035 129.854500 138.822375 the other kids are decent and there are programs provided and foods done properly and all those kinds of things that you think of you know to to worry about
sw2943B-ms98-a-0036 138.822375 140.233875 i
sw2943B-ms98-a-0037 140.233875 145.161125 you know you your children build bonds with those kids that are there
sw2943B-ms98-a-0038 145.161125 146.865125 and yet
sw2943B-ms98-a-0039 146.865125 150.412375 a[nd]- and they're usually very young preschool age 
sw2943B-ms98-a-0040 150.412375 152.249500 and yet when that's gone
sw2943B-ms98-a-0041 152.249500 153.347375 [silence]
sw2943B-ms98-a-0042 153.347375 162.758375 you don't you don't even know who those other mothers are chances are they're like little cousins you know or brothers and sisters and yet they never see one another again
sw2943B-ms98-a-0043 162.758375 164.835125 so you know i think that's a
sw2943B-ms98-a-0044 164.835125 167.014000 uh that's a factor too 
sw2943B-ms98-a-0045 167.014000 168.237250 [silence]
sw2943B-ms98-a-0046 168.237250 172.030000 most of my uh i come from a family of nine children
sw2943B-ms98-a-0047 172.030000 177.192875 myself my own you know children my uh nuclear family
sw2943B-ms98-a-0048 177.192875 181.036625 and most of us have somehow been able to work out
sw2943B-ms98-a-0049 181.036625 184.684250 either aunts and uncles uh
sw2943B-ms98-a-0050 184.684250 186.827250 siblings
sw2943B-ms98-a-0051 186.827250 194.924375 you know older siblings younger siblings you know some of us have uh have have had children that were quite stretched out in age or 
sw2943B-ms98-a-0052 194.924375 207.130625 situations where you know kind of joint where mothers worked at night or you know alternated or dad worked out of the home so he could tend the ki[ds]- you know different things and um 
sw2943B-ms98-a-0053 207.130625 212.258750 not very many of us have had to actually have that full day every day
sw2943B-ms98-a-0054 212.258750 215.557500 day care in a herd kind of situation and the one
sw2943B-ms98-a-0055 215.557500 221.139125 [silence]
sw2943B-ms98-a-0056 221.139125 222.903500 i think so
sw2943B-ms98-a-0057 222.903500 239.552375 [silence]
sw2943B-ms98-a-0058 239.552375 251.024625 well and at the time that i was doing you know in home child care i- i felt real strongly you know that that was a needed to be a real viable opportunity for parents to
sw2943B-ms98-a-0059 251.024625 260.358375 to have that option that they didn't feel you know a lot of people most people cannot afford to have a nanny
sw2943B-ms98-a-0060 260.358375 264.156250 or a governess you know type situation where that
sw2943B-ms98-a-0061 264.156250 270.116000 housekeeper someone in the home their own home is tending to their own children
sw2943B-ms98-a-0062 270.116000 284.506250 day in and day out that's just a luxury most people can't afford if they could afford that they probably wouldn't be going to work except for the person who's got a career you know who's um i think more and more i think uh we're going to see 
sw2943B-ms98-a-0063 284.506250 292.541750 child care change i think there's going to be more corporate involvement i think we're going to see a lot more um
sw2943B-ms98-a-0064 292.541750 296.670250 paternity leave and options that involve the dads more
sw2943B-ms98-a-0065 296.670250 302.433125 [silence]

sw2943B-ms98-a-0071 310.172625 315.518125 well basically you know we already have my husband works for a large uh oil corporation
sw2943B-ms98-a-0072 315.518125 323.680125 and they have you know a deduction kind of plan where it's tax free you know if you put it in ahead of time yeah
sw2943B-ms98-a-0073 323.680125 324.952000 i think that's
sw2943B-ms98-a-0074 324.952000 325.638125 [silence]

sw2943B-ms98-a-0078 330.558500 332.423000 [silence]
sw2943B-ms98-a-0079 332.423000 337.966000 no no they don't i'm saying i think that is one of one way of the future that we will see

sw2943B-ms98-a-0081 338.980875 341.346250 and and much needed i
sw2943B-ms98-a-0082 341.346250 346.134875 i like to see those kinds of things that emphasize the family unity rather than
sw2943B-ms98-a-0083 346.134875 347.238625 [silence]
sw2943B-ms98-a-0084 347.238625 348.933000 you know yeah 
sw2943B-ms98-a-0085 348.933000 353.568000 because we just have a generation of people that are not going to be happy with
sw2943B-ms98-a-0086 353.568000 355.159750 either parent
sw2943B-ms98-a-0087 355.159750 359.614125 not when and our economy is almost precludes

sw2943B-ms98-a-0108 450.564000 457.757750 i read the most interesting article here oh gosh it's been about two months ago right around Easter time i remember thinking it
sw2943B-ms98-a-0109 457.757750 459.378750 was when i read it
sw2943B-ms98-a-0110 459.378750 466.003000 about a husband and a wife that honest and truly share the same job for Arco Oil and Gas
sw2943B-ms98-a-0111 466.003000 467.684625 [silence]
sw2943B-ms98-a-0112 467.684625 476.847625 i'm trying to think it was computer related they were both over a department he worked one week she works the next they have two children
sw2943B-ms98-a-0113 476.847625 486.700250 how very unusual you know i mean for to find two people who even could do the same job or have the same education to do it but they'd met on site you know and
sw2943B-ms98-a-0114 486.700250 489.626125 the relationship developed and you know they married and
sw2943B-ms98-a-0115 489.626125 490.667375 [silence]
sw2943B-ms98-a-0116 490.667375 493.698750 that would support it and the uh
sw2943B-ms98-a-0117 493.698750 499.150875 course you always wonder you know when you read it in the newspaper is it really all you [laughter-know] 
sw2943B-ms98-a-0118 499.150875 508.698375 did they just ignore half the team who can't stand this arrangements but the team members that were interviewed all seemed to be very supportive of it and uh
sw2943B-ms98-a-0119 508.698375 513.312625 and said that their that their management styles meshed real well
sw2943B-ms98-a-0120 513.312625 514.326375 and
sw2943B-ms98-a-0121 514.326375 515.515750 [silence]
sw2943B-ms98-a-0122 515.515750 517.990125 isn't that interesting very novel you know
sw2943B-ms98-a-0123 517.990125 519.291875 [silence]
sw2943B-ms98-a-0124 519.291875 526.848375 you know you hear of women you know maybe like on flex time thing you know [vocalized-noise] but you're talking file clerk i [laughter-mean] you [laughter-know] you're not talking 
sw2943B-ms98-a-0125 526.848375 527.859625 [silence]
sw2943B-ms98-a-0126 527.859625 528.546250 you know

sw2943B-ms98-a-0129 534.728625 541.385000 um-hum um-hum our uh our dentists are husband and wife team work out of the same office
sw2943B-ms98-a-0130 541.385000 544.622000 yeah and uh they have children
sw2943B-ms98-a-0131 544.622000 546.526000 [silence]
sw2943B-ms98-a-0132 546.526000 547.322250 that's

sw2943B-ms98-a-0134 552.209000 553.465125 and yet it's worth it
sw2943B-ms98-a-0135 553.465125 560.094000 it truly is worth it you know there are some days when you wonder if it is but you know face it you know the
sw2943B-ms98-a-0136 560.094000 565.017375 population is decreasing you know and somebody's going to have these little babies and
sw2943B-ms98-a-0137 565.017375 569.564625 [silence]
sw2943B-ms98-a-0138 569.564625 576.544625 oh yes my uh my big ones are wonderful to help with my little one and uh
sw2943B-ms98-a-0139 576.544625 590.019500 we are we're to the point now where we only have one that has to be sat like you would say baby sitting or tending but i still believe that it's very important that moms be in the home in the afternoon
sw2943B-ms98-a-0140 590.019500 593.752000 when those kids come home from school and stuff that's just
sw2943B-ms98-a-0141 593.752000 598.305125 you know that's i think it's just as critical for middle school and high schoolers as it is
