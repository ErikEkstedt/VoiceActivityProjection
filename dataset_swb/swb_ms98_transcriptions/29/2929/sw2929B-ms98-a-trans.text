sw2929B-ms98-a-0003 3.372250 13.329500 well i believe that the um the voice that uh initialized this call asked about uh if we thought that it should be something that
sw2929B-ms98-a-0004 13.329500 15.767500 should be put into action
sw2929B-ms98-a-0005 15.767500 21.023250 [silence]
sw2929B-ms98-a-0006 21.023250 24.739000 yes i i i i would be committed to that
sw2929B-ms98-a-0007 24.739000 26.007250 because
sw2929B-ms98-a-0008 26.007250 28.342000 oh definitely yes
sw2929B-ms98-a-0009 28.342000 32.271875 i know that there are many countries that um
sw2929B-ms98-a-0010 32.271875 39.392500 are very successful with the operation of the government uh providing that plan
sw2929B-ms98-a-0011 39.392500 46.633000 [silence]
sw2929B-ms98-a-0012 46.633000 52.448375 um i'm not sure wha[t]- how their program is run but i know it has been successful
sw2929B-ms98-a-0013 52.448375 57.694500 and i would really have to uh read the history of
sw2929B-ms98-a-0014 57.694500 63.681250 probably i uh the country that has faired very well with it i'd like to see the uh
sw2929B-ms98-a-0015 63.681250 65.920625 the data on that
sw2929B-ms98-a-0016 65.920625 79.666750 [silence]
sw2929B-ms98-a-0017 79.666750 81.348875 well i
sw2929B-ms98-a-0018 81.348875 87.215125 yes i think that's primary is if you have a good relationship
sw2929B-ms98-a-0019 87.215125 90.147750 with your doctor that you can feel free to discuss
sw2929B-ms98-a-0020 90.147750 91.761500 anything with him
sw2929B-ms98-a-0021 91.761500 93.131750 and uh
sw2929B-ms98-a-0022 93.131750 96.996125 [silence]
sw2929B-ms98-a-0023 96.996125 102.117625 oh absolutely that the choice would be yours yes if you felt that you weren't being
sw2929B-ms98-a-0024 102.117625 106.388625 um given the proper guidelines for your health
sw2929B-ms98-a-0025 106.388625 110.878625 that you should be able to make um a choice there
sw2929B-ms98-a-0026 110.878625 134.317250 [silence]
sw2929B-ms98-a-0027 134.317250 137.360125 yes and the expense of that yes
sw2929B-ms98-a-0028 137.360125 150.483500 [silence]
sw2929B-ms98-a-0029 150.483500 155.304250 well i would i would think that they would have that as part part of the benefit
sw2929B-ms98-a-0030 155.304250 159.792750 to the health care program that you would indeed have a choice
sw2929B-ms98-a-0031 159.792750 163.514375 that you could select that individual yourself
sw2929B-ms98-a-0032 163.514375 166.962375 and i'm sure that they would have a history of each doctor
sw2929B-ms98-a-0033 166.962375 170.451875 and hopefully that they would have their um
sw2929B-ms98-a-0034 170.451875 172.918625 accreditations there too
sw2929B-ms98-a-0035 172.918625 181.595625 [silence]
sw2929B-ms98-a-0036 181.595625 183.655125 yes um
sw2929B-ms98-a-0037 183.655125 189.134000 but those guidelines have to be set up and i think they should be voted on by the public
sw2929B-ms98-a-0038 189.134000 190.650500 and uh
sw2929B-ms98-a-0039 190.650500 192.870125 uh-huh uh-huh
sw2929B-ms98-a-0040 192.870125 195.032750 right yes
sw2929B-ms98-a-0041 195.032750 200.574125 and of course they would give a full plan of what their intentions would be and
sw2929B-ms98-a-0042 200.574125 202.379125 um
sw2929B-ms98-a-0043 202.379125 204.278125 i think that's
sw2929B-ms98-a-0044 204.278125 209.929500 primary uh for the health if they were going to have a universal health care plan
sw2929B-ms98-a-0045 209.929500 214.248500 that uh they would have all the facts and the figures and uh
sw2929B-ms98-a-0046 214.248500 219.602750 what it would mean to each individual family or and an an individual
sw2929B-ms98-a-0047 219.602750 221.913375 perhaps being single
sw2929B-ms98-a-0048 221.913375 224.759500 [silence]
sw2929B-ms98-a-0049 224.759500 228.161125 um i'm not sure what else that uh
sw2929B-ms98-a-0050 228.161125 231.632125 we could address uh on health care
sw2929B-ms98-a-0051 231.632125 232.806875 um
sw2929B-ms98-a-0052 232.806875 235.580750 other than the fact i think um
sw2929B-ms98-a-0053 235.580750 241.240000 the eyes and the ears and the uh whole self should be uh
sw2929B-ms98-a-0054 241.240000 252.357125 uh included in all of that uh dental eye care and uh [noise] our body as a whole should be included in that because
sw2929B-ms98-a-0055 252.357125 257.295125 there's so many avenues that needs to be um
sw2929B-ms98-a-0056 257.295125 260.763750 undertaken in a program like that
sw2929B-ms98-a-0057 260.763750 262.387125 um
sw2929B-ms98-a-0058 262.387125 266.327250 i wouldn't want to have to go for a private doctor for
sw2929B-ms98-a-0059 266.327250 270.169250 anything and not be covered by the program
sw2929B-ms98-a-0060 270.169250 283.497500 [silence]
sw2929B-ms98-a-0061 283.497500 284.891375 uh-huh
sw2929B-ms98-a-0062 284.891375 291.263000 [silence]
sw2929B-ms98-a-0063 291.263000 296.818625 and does he have an option uh if he doesn't care for the personality
sw2929B-ms98-a-0064 296.818625 300.488875 [silence]
sw2929B-ms98-a-0065 300.488875 302.014625 oh i see

sw2929B-ms98-a-0071 316.203875 320.317250 well if he's pleased with it i guess that's uh the bottom line
sw2929B-ms98-a-0072 320.317250 326.253875 so but i i would be afraid of what would happen if you had a personality conflict or something
sw2929B-ms98-a-0073 326.253875 331.201750 yeah cause there's always that opposite story there
sw2929B-ms98-a-0074 331.201750 339.710250 [silence]
