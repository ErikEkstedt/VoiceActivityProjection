sw2987A-ms98-a-0026 97.107125 100.755500 but most of them charge between eighteen and twenty one percent per year
sw2987A-ms98-a-0027 100.755500 102.246875 i think that's
sw2987A-ms98-a-0028 102.246875 106.982875 [silence]
sw2987A-ms98-a-0029 106.982875 108.921750 right right
sw2987A-ms98-a-0030 108.921750 114.074625 and i look for a grace period too so that they don't charge interest on from from the day of purchase
sw2987A-ms98-a-0031 114.074625 115.123000 [silence]
sw2987A-ms98-a-0032 115.123000 117.337250 and of course no annual fee

sw2987A-ms98-a-0039 149.141750 155.385000 and uh the incentive there was that they'd give you ten percent off on your first purchase with that credit card
sw2987A-ms98-a-0040 155.385000 159.291125 so i got that card just so i could uh make a major purchase

sw2987A-ms98-a-0052 217.084125 222.202625 and uh keeping a credit cards uh charged up is just uh
sw2987A-ms98-a-0053 222.202625 226.513500 not a very good way to uh to ma[ke]- to make use of borrowing money
