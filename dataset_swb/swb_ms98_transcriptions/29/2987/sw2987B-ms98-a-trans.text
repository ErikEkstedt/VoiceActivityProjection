sw2987B-ms98-a-0030 73.621250 77.143750 and there's it's it's kind of hard to beat TI
sw2987B-ms98-a-0031 77.143750 81.877750 and so uh you know usually we just trash it just tear it up and trash it an[d]-
sw2987B-ms98-a-0032 81.877750 83.858500 m[ost]- most of the time it goes unopened

sw2987B-ms98-a-0034 86.992500 88.620875 yeah if if that much
sw2987B-ms98-a-0035 88.620875 92.525125 they're thirteen something but i'm not sure if it's i think it's a flat thirteen right now
sw2987B-ms98-a-0036 92.525125 96.691375 [silence]
sw2987B-ms98-a-0037 96.691375 97.470625 yeah

sw2987B-ms98-a-0040 100.867875 107.555500 and then you['re]- then you're if you're that lucky you get to pay them another twenty five bucks a year just to be that privileged to get twenty one percent a year [laughter]

sw2987B-ms98-a-0045 117.635750 123.872875 yeah that would that would help a lot i i'm not even sure why i mean the purpose of an annual fee i'm not really
sw2987B-ms98-a-0046 123.872875 128.846375 [silence]
sw2987B-ms98-a-0047 128.846375 133.555125 well i guess so because_1 it's not any more prestigious to have to pay it
sw2987B-ms98-a-0048 133.555125 137.714625 uh as far as getting another card where you don't i mean you know
sw2987B-ms98-a-0049 137.714625 148.841125 [silence]
sw2987B-ms98-a-0050 148.841125 150.149750 oh really

sw2987B-ms98-a-0055 159.972875 162.210750 right yeah that
sw2987B-ms98-a-0056 162.210750 165.862750 [silence]
sw2987B-ms98-a-0057 165.862750 166.942500 yeah

sw2987B-ms98-a-0059 168.340375 177.547750 right i did that with my husband uh he was off working at TI in Austin one day and so i went out to the mall to kind of look around hit Mervyn's 
sw2987B-ms98-a-0060 177.547750 188.089500 and found some s[tuff]- stuff after Christmas on sale and ended up getting fifteen percent off already off of it already whatever it was lower and i think that's the only card i have that's
sw2987B-ms98-a-0061 188.089500 198.944250 you know recently is gotten a Mervyn's card and i used it for i think for the first time when i was in Houston this weekend and i have i've had it for months
sw2987B-ms98-a-0062 198.944250 202.398375 [silence]
sw2987B-ms98-a-0063 202.398375 205.807000 yeah yeah i don't i don't like it a whole lot either
sw2987B-ms98-a-0064 205.807000 215.145625 [silence]
sw2987B-ms98-a-0065 215.145625 217.604500 yeah yeah
sw2987B-ms98-a-0066 217.604500 224.762625 [silence]
sw2987B-ms98-a-0067 224.762625 233.200500 yeah i never understood how people could i mean there are some people who say well i can't charge it it's at it's limit and i thought God how can you charge a credit card to its limit
sw2987B-ms98-a-0068 233.200500 241.935375 it just it just i guess it's that that you know lack of discipline when you have a piece of plastic that says pay later you know
sw2987B-ms98-a-0069 241.935375 244.957750 yeah and i just it's that
sw2987B-ms98-a-0070 244.957750 247.878875 yeah it just bo[rrow]- worry about it tomorrow [laughter]
sw2987B-ms98-a-0071 247.878875 259.308000 yeah and it just i don't i don't really go for them_1 and i in fact i had my own before we got married and ended up cutting them_1 up just for the fact that TI had lower rates
sw2987B-ms98-a-0072 259.308000 267.458500 you know and decided and i mean when i tried to close with Chase Manhattan it was just like pulling teeth
sw2987B-ms98-a-0073 267.458500 271.359000 i mean i couldn't close they'd send me a statement every little this is your new
sw2987B-ms98-a-0074 271.359000 283.654875 you know balance with bonus points or whatever you know and it's like look i closed this months ago and i don't want any more of your letters i don't want anything and well you have a credit balance well send me a check [laughter] you know
sw2987B-ms98-a-0075 283.654875 293.495250 [silence]
sw2987B-ms98-a-0076 293.495250 294.430000 yeah
sw2987B-ms98-a-0077 294.430000 296.866500 [silence]
sw2987B-ms98-a-0078 296.866500 297.610375 yeah
sw2987B-ms98-a-0079 297.610375 299.985125 [silence]
sw2987B-ms98-a-0080 299.985125 300.955750 yeah
sw2987B-ms98-a-0081 300.955750 307.723000 yeah they do but we we were in in that same boat a couple of years ago and they had said well
sw2987B-ms98-a-0082 307.723000 314.779500 just list your major ones and and the balance still owed on it you know or give it a balance still owed on it and
sw2987B-ms98-a-0083 314.779500 316.788750 that's all we did
sw2987B-ms98-a-0084 316.788750 317.836625 [silence]
sw2987B-ms98-a-0085 317.836625 318.855125 right
sw2987B-ms98-a-0086 318.855125 324.973875 [silence]
sw2987B-ms98-a-0087 324.973875 330.551375 yeah and it's like well who are you to approve [laughter] something for me without my permission anyway
sw2987B-ms98-a-0088 330.551375 333.999250 but i think um i think what you can do as far as
sw2987B-ms98-a-0089 333.999250 336.115375 i don't think as many companies
sw2987B-ms98-a-0090 336.115375 342.042625 when you are a good customer i don't think they report that as much as they should their delinquent customers
sw2987B-ms98-a-0091 342.042625 347.911875 because a lot of times you have to write and ask them to report it to the credit bureau so that you look like you have good credit
sw2987B-ms98-a-0092 347.911875 349.325125 [silence]
sw2987B-ms98-a-0093 349.325125 354.738625 as far as you know paying off you know your cards early or on time or whatever
sw2987B-ms98-a-0094 354.738625 363.008625 that usually doesn't happen unless i've heard people say well you have to write to ask that and i say well you know if someone's so quick to turn you over because you're thirty days late
sw2987B-ms98-a-0095 363.008625 366.007250 i think they sh[ould]- they should do do that more often
sw2987B-ms98-a-0096 366.007250 373.530875 [silence]
sw2987B-ms98-a-0097 373.530875 377.156000 what do you think about that uh Discover card
sw2987B-ms98-a-0098 377.156000 385.424500 [silence]
sw2987B-ms98-a-0099 385.424500 388.152000 [laughter]
sw2987B-ms98-a-0100 388.152000 393.307375 [silence]
sw2987B-ms98-a-0101 393.307375 394.695000 oh really
sw2987B-ms98-a-0102 394.695000 404.772375 [silence]
sw2987B-ms98-a-0103 404.772375 406.738500 the dollar you didn't cash
sw2987B-ms98-a-0104 406.738500 413.500750 oh oh well i was wondering how that that worked because it's like you know we'll pay you for and i'm going wait a minute
sw2987B-ms98-a-0105 413.500750 415.069875 you know
sw2987B-ms98-a-0106 415.069875 427.025125 [silence]
sw2987B-ms98-a-0107 427.025125 432.701000 yeah we don't we wouldn't even have one if it wasn't for TI and Steve traveling we just
sw2987B-ms98-a-0108 432.701000 434.038125 you know
sw2987B-ms98-a-0109 434.038125 436.573250 [silence]
sw2987B-ms98-a-0110 436.573250 438.233375 no
sw2987B-ms98-a-0111 438.233375 440.059250 and uh
sw2987B-ms98-a-0112 440.059250 449.451250 we basically just have the we you know we cut up a lot of cards when we you know like it's just as easy just to use two you know instead of paying so much
