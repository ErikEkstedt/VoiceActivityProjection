sw2927A-ms98-a-0005 12.993750 14.017875 [silence]
sw2927A-ms98-a-0006 14.017875 24.701750 no i don't think so i wouldn't think yeah i- n[orth]- far north Dallas [laughter] yeah about a half a mile from Plano [laughter] so we're in the

sw2927A-ms98-a-0008 29.445750 34.097875 um i don't know i haven't lived here let's see we m[oved]- lived out of state
sw2927A-ms98-a-0009 34.097875 43.169750 in Wisconsin and we just we lived here ten years ago and when we first lived here we li[ved]- we were in Garland East Richardson and um doesn't seem like it was quite as humid
sw2927A-ms98-a-0010 43.169750 54.579500 and i don't know then we went we lived in uh Madison Wisconsin for five years um for my husband's schooling an[d]- graduate schooling and it just it's a lot cleaner up there but um
sw2927A-ms98-a-0011 54.579500 57.769375 it's a lot colder too so
sw2927A-ms98-a-0012 57.769375 62.353000 uh his job he came back to start work again for a different company so
sw2927A-ms98-a-0013 62.353000 68.296750 said here here's a he[re]- here we are again it just seems a little more humid than it i don't ever remember
sw2927A-ms98-a-0014 68.296750 71.882125 course you know you only remember the good stuff but um
sw2927A-ms98-a-0015 71.882125 73.958750 i just don't remember the humidity
sw2927A-ms98-a-0016 73.958750 76.470875 this much rain and this humidity
sw2927A-ms98-a-0017 76.470875 78.010625 [silence]
sw2927A-ms98-a-0018 78.010625 87.806875 uh yeah they are actually though it was a lot rainier here in the winter uh we came back up August it's just a lot rainier than i remember it all th[e]- through the seasons you know
sw2927A-ms98-a-0019 87.806875 89.432875 um
sw2927A-ms98-a-0020 89.432875 96.448250 [silence]
sw2927A-ms98-a-0021 96.448250 101.381750 yeah and i think it's because it's just getting more crowded and more polluted i really do think that's part of it
sw2927A-ms98-a-0022 101.381750 114.192000 um [vocalized-noise] in in Wisconsin and Minnesota when they get winters it's um th[e]- the winters are bad but not what you hear about it's just like down here when you hear when people here think it's a hundred and six people up north think it's a hundred and sixty down here
sw2927A-ms98-a-0023 114.192000 117.617500 hundre[d]- i'm making that up you know when it's only like ninety five
sw2927A-ms98-a-0024 117.617500 122.182625 um it's just like up there when you hear it's forty below it's probably really only five below
sw2927A-ms98-a-0025 122.182625 124.003500 um and it's so dry that it's
sw2927A-ms98-a-0026 124.003500 131.086000 it's like going to Ar[izona]- well probably what you Arizona used to be like you know it's just dry and cool so it's not it's not what you think it is
sw2927A-ms98-a-0027 131.086000 138.175875 um no there've been times though when it gets so frigid that you [laughter] you can't stand it where did you move here from
sw2927A-ms98-a-0028 138.175875 142.213375 well there you could talk about that that's that's a strange state for
sw2927A-ms98-a-0029 142.213375 144.294750 [silence]
sw2927A-ms98-a-0030 144.294750 146.413125 oh there you go okay
sw2927A-ms98-a-0031 146.413125 154.839625 [silence]
sw2927A-ms98-a-0032 154.839625 157.868375 [laughter] this is very true
sw2927A-ms98-a-0033 157.868375 162.152000 yeah right well actually the summers up there we thought were the most beautiful time of the year
sw2927A-ms98-a-0034 162.152000 174.012750 um in terms of Colorado i know my husband likes to camp and backpack and all the stuff i don't like um but i'd used to go on i worked for a mortgage company in Wisconsin and i did a lot of business in uh 
sw2927A-ms98-a-0035 174.012750 179.110250 um Colo[rado]- well Denver and that's that's probably one of the stranger things when you see the air inversions
sw2927A-ms98-a-0036 179.110250 185.657500 and then you go into the mountains and it's snowy and col[d]- uh it just was a very mixed bag in terms of Colorado
sw2927A-ms98-a-0037 185.657500 191.571500 [silence]
sw2927A-ms98-a-0038 191.571500 193.398375 is that strange
sw2927A-ms98-a-0039 193.398375 195.654125 [silence]
sw2927A-ms98-a-0040 195.654125 200.395625 yeah and then things like torn[adoes]- are there tornadoes in Colorado yes or n[o]- i don't
sw2927A-ms98-a-0041 200.395625 202.715375 [silence]
sw2927A-ms98-a-0042 202.715375 204.428500 yeah
sw2927A-ms98-a-0043 204.428500 208.350375 [silence]
sw2927A-ms98-a-0044 208.350375 210.433250 the mountains yeah
sw2927A-ms98-a-0045 210.433250 214.820250 even i mean i'm originally from Pittsburgh Pennsylvania and i can tell you that um
sw2927A-ms98-a-0046 214.820250 224.072625 they've even had in eastern Ohio and the[n]- western Pennsylvania they've even had i'm going to say mini tornadoes for lack of a better word and and that's just a part of the country that it's rolling hillside
sw2927A-ms98-a-0047 224.072625 226.460000 that was unheard of you know twenty years ago
sw2927A-ms98-a-0048 226.460000 230.034875 um so i don't know what's happening if it's you know we are
sw2927A-ms98-a-0049 230.034875 232.464125 the greenhouse i[s]- i don't really [laughter-know]
sw2927A-ms98-a-0050 232.464125 234.011750 it just [noise] you know
sw2927A-ms98-a-0051 234.011750 236.164500 it's definitely not as um
sw2927A-ms98-a-0052 236.164500 246.916875 i know i associate the pollution with weather in general so i guess one thing we do miss is that's a smaller town and it w[as]- it was ju[st]- it just seemed a little bit more pleasant in terms of the atmosphere you know
sw2927A-ms98-a-0053 246.916875 248.562875 [silence]
sw2927A-ms98-a-0054 248.562875 250.471875 you too okay bye-bye
