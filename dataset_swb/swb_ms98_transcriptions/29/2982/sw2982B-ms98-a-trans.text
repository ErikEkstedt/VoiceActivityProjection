sw2982B-ms98-a-0003 2.166750 5.806500 uh well i work with computers just like your [laughter-son]
sw2982B-ms98-a-0004 5.806500 8.818875 and i actually do research in speech recognition
sw2982B-ms98-a-0005 8.818875 14.622000 and so as part of the reason i'm participating in the project is to to see how the stuff goes but um 
sw2982B-ms98-a-0006 14.622000 20.348250 i was working well actually i haven't worked for any large companies per se
sw2982B-ms98-a-0007 20.348250 30.572000 uh recently but hopefully the job that i will have will have lots of benefits namely lots of vacations not real good salary but lots of vacations but
sw2982B-ms98-a-0008 30.572000 33.552375 [silence]
sw2982B-ms98-a-0009 33.552375 35.043500 um-hum
sw2982B-ms98-a-0010 35.043500 36.907625 [noise] yeah the uh
sw2982B-ms98-a-0011 36.907625 38.054500 [silence]
sw2982B-ms98-a-0012 38.054500 39.793375 well actually where [noise]
sw2982B-ms98-a-0013 39.793375 41.820250 i was working with the company [noise]
sw2982B-ms98-a-0014 41.820250 52.145000 one of the companies i was working for actually had very good health care benefits which these days i think are really important because_1 health care is so ridiculously expensive because_1 we're we're paying our own insurance right now
sw2982B-ms98-a-0015 52.145000 53.545250 [silence]
sw2982B-ms98-a-0016 53.545250 62.982625 for it um and i'm we actually had a little baby so i'm taking a little bit of [laughter] time off from work ah congratulations 
sw2982B-ms98-a-0017 62.982625 64.050500 [silence]
sw2982B-ms98-a-0018 64.050500 68.489375 and um so one thing that i'm very concerned with now is
sw2982B-ms98-a-0019 68.489375 76.846375 first of all health benefits because_1 it's more important with a family and you know our doctor's vi[sits]- routine doctor's visits covered my health insurance only covers um
sw2982B-ms98-a-0020 76.846375 80.424875 [noise] your emergency care and so
sw2982B-ms98-a-0021 80.424875 82.952750 right yeah but i don't
sw2982B-ms98-a-0022 82.952750 85.208250 [silence]
sw2982B-ms98-a-0023 85.208250 89.868625 right well my our deductible is five hundred but it's for each
sw2982B-ms98-a-0024 89.868625 92.270875 event yeah
sw2982B-ms98-a-0025 92.270875 98.048375 right but you know so it covers the emergency things but it doesn't cover if you get sick it doesn't cover
sw2982B-ms98-a-0026 98.048375 100.355625 [noise] doctor's visits things like that
sw2982B-ms98-a-0027 100.355625 104.525125 [silence]
sw2982B-ms98-a-0028 104.525125 106.937125 oh yeah it certainly is
sw2982B-ms98-a-0029 106.937125 108.216875 um
sw2982B-ms98-a-0030 108.216875 112.769250 [silence]
sw2982B-ms98-a-0031 112.769250 114.945750 um-hum
sw2982B-ms98-a-0032 114.945750 115.799375 [silence]
sw2982B-ms98-a-0033 115.799375 117.328750 wow
sw2982B-ms98-a-0034 117.328750 120.167000 [silence]
sw2982B-ms98-a-0035 120.167000 121.480000 um-hum
sw2982B-ms98-a-0036 121.480000 127.050375 [silence]
sw2982B-ms98-a-0037 127.050375 130.889250 and probably the medi[cal]- care -[medi]cal care is less expensive too 
sw2982B-ms98-a-0038 130.889250 132.105500 [silence]
sw2982B-ms98-a-0039 132.105500 133.411750 um-hum
sw2982B-ms98-a-0040 133.411750 137.612625 [silence]
sw2982B-ms98-a-0041 137.612625 143.319750 so i think that in general the doctor's fees are probably lower there and so the insurance would cost lower
sw2982B-ms98-a-0042 143.319750 150.818000 [silence]
sw2982B-ms98-a-0043 150.818000 158.714125 well i know that friends of mine had a baby up in Boston and their costs were about fifty percent of what it cost to have it in Manhattan
sw2982B-ms98-a-0044 158.714125 163.118000 and they were at one of the better hospitals and you know good doctors in Boston
sw2982B-ms98-a-0045 163.118000 167.629375 and i was at one of the big hospitals in New York but that's a huge difference just between
sw2982B-ms98-a-0046 167.629375 171.137000 you know and it's two big cities that i think of as somewhat comparable
sw2982B-ms98-a-0047 171.137000 172.243375 [silence]
sw2982B-ms98-a-0048 172.243375 182.358250 so i was pretty shocked at that but the other thing that i'm really concerned about and most companies don't have some are starting to have is day care because it would be really nice to be able to have
sw2982B-ms98-a-0049 182.358250 189.983000 you know someone that could watch my daughter at work and i'd go to work and if she were sick i could go down and see her if she needs to be fed whatever it is
sw2982B-ms98-a-0050 189.983000 191.469250 and i
sw2982B-ms98-a-0051 191.469250 193.695125 it would be more convenient more productive
sw2982B-ms98-a-0052 193.695125 194.740000 [silence]
sw2982B-ms98-a-0053 194.740000 195.877375 i think
sw2982B-ms98-a-0054 195.877375 199.062375 [silence]
sw2982B-ms98-a-0055 199.062375 200.331375 uh-huh
sw2982B-ms98-a-0056 200.331375 209.140000 [silence]
sw2982B-ms98-a-0057 209.140000 212.891125 and you[r]- and your and your hours are much more constrained and things like that
sw2982B-ms98-a-0058 212.891125 223.633750 and that to me well that you know the those three things the health care vacation and day care are probably the most important benefits i should suppose i should be concerned with 
sw2982B-ms98-a-0059 223.633750 228.005125 life insurance and uh retirement plans but [laughter]
sw2982B-ms98-a-0060 228.005125 233.057750 [silence]
sw2982B-ms98-a-0061 233.057750 234.342250 yeah
sw2982B-ms98-a-0062 234.342250 242.639250 [silence]
sw2982B-ms98-a-0063 242.639250 255.682875 right because_1 you're you know certainly something like day care at the work place would like make life so much simpler that it's worth paying you know having a lower salary i would certainly accept a lower salary for that
sw2982B-ms98-a-0064 255.682875 257.017125 [silence]
sw2982B-ms98-a-0065 257.017125 264.735875 you know everything else being equal because_1 your life would be so much easier and there's a question of quality of life also [vocalized-noise]
sw2982B-ms98-a-0066 264.735875 268.250875 [silence]
sw2982B-ms98-a-0067 268.250875 269.816250 yep
sw2982B-ms98-a-0068 269.816250 270.842375 [silence]
sw2982B-ms98-a-0069 270.842375 275.262375 right and you you you don't feel like you're a half hour away if she something happened
sw2982B-ms98-a-0070 275.262375 278.818000 and you're less preoccupied with it i think
sw2982B-ms98-a-0071 278.818000 284.851500 so but unfortunately there aren't i think IBM has started having that in certain locations
sw2982B-ms98-a-0072 284.851500 289.070250 [silence]
sw2982B-ms98-a-0073 289.070250 292.000625 uh-huh is that locally
sw2982B-ms98-a-0074 292.000625 293.514000 uh-huh
sw2982B-ms98-a-0075 293.514000 302.186375 yeah because_1 Pittsburgh's a big enough city too but you know i wouldn't be surprised if thing's like that didn't happen more in smaller communities before they happen in bigger ones
sw2982B-ms98-a-0076 302.186375 306.676250 just because people might be more flexible in smaller locations and
sw2982B-ms98-a-0077 306.676250 310.015375 things like that because_1 many times small companies offer
sw2982B-ms98-a-0078 310.015375 312.286875 better benefits
sw2982B-ms98-a-0079 312.286875 315.200875 in terms of quality of life than larger companies
sw2982B-ms98-a-0080 315.200875 325.088000 like uh one company had proposed to me that i could come back to work after having the baby um any where between ten and forty hours a week
sw2982B-ms98-a-0081 325.088000 329.466625 and um you know c[all]- call my own days call my own hours and
sw2982B-ms98-a-0082 329.466625 331.770125 yeah a[nd]- and
sw2982B-ms98-a-0083 331.770125 335.877875 you know which many times at a large company it's almost impossible
sw2982B-ms98-a-0084 335.877875 338.052625 to do things like that
sw2982B-ms98-a-0085 338.052625 339.713250 [silence]
sw2982B-ms98-a-0086 339.713250 345.723125 right and if you get two weeks off you get two weeks off and you're not allowed two weeks and one day
sw2982B-ms98-a-0087 345.723125 350.239250 and so it all depends on what your position is there too
sw2982B-ms98-a-0088 350.239250 352.497375 [silence]
sw2982B-ms98-a-0089 352.497375 353.966625 [noise] yeah
sw2982B-ms98-a-0090 353.966625 358.539375 [silence]
sw2982B-ms98-a-0091 358.539375 359.672000 um-hum
sw2982B-ms98-a-0092 359.672000 360.924125 [silence]
sw2982B-ms98-a-0093 360.924125 362.717000 uh-huh
sw2982B-ms98-a-0094 362.717000 365.475250 [silence]
sw2982B-ms98-a-0095 365.475250 375.625750 was that when you were um well you know those have its pluses and minuses too i've been a consultant recently and so i don't have any benefits at all and 
sw2982B-ms98-a-0096 375.625750 376.783250 [silence]
sw2982B-ms98-a-0097 376.783250 389.001625 right and the same thing my husband is unfortunately being paid as a consultant and we tried to argue that he should get more salary for that than what he is and um they they they
sw2982B-ms98-a-0098 389.001625 393.090250 right and they they refuse to give him more salary
sw2982B-ms98-a-0099 393.090250 403.202625 because they say they can't pay more than this and that and they're not allowed to pay him more than what his previous salary was and things like that and you know times are rough now so it's new it's harder to get
sw2982B-ms98-a-0100 403.202625 404.866000 the uh
sw2982B-ms98-a-0101 404.866000 408.303000 your increases and things but um
sw2982B-ms98-a-0102 408.303000 413.834750 [silence]
sw2982B-ms98-a-0103 413.834750 415.628625 yeah well the
sw2982B-ms98-a-0104 415.628625 416.943500 [silence]
sw2982B-ms98-a-0105 416.943500 423.140500 right well [vocalized-noise] he's been doing a long term he's being called a consultant and he's really sort of a temporary employee at a place 
sw2982B-ms98-a-0106 423.140500 434.190500 and they they pay him as a consultant but he doesn't get any health benefits he doesn't get well we don't care about retirement benefits he doesn't get um vacation benefits and he does a lot of things that
sw2982B-ms98-a-0107 434.190500 447.568250 get factored into somebody else's salary so really his salary should be you know twenty percent or thirty percent higher just based on that not including the fact that you know it's a less long term commitment for the company and all that sort of stuff
sw2982B-ms98-a-0108 447.568250 448.720000 [silence]
