sw2956B-ms98-a-0127 556.497500 566.657375 and they uh the minorities could not get enough of a vote out to to pass their plan and this is something that had been going on for months it was on the news every night 
sw2956B-ms98-a-0128 566.657375 577.040500 they and they have had lawsuits over it i mean it was it was a major issue and there still wasn't enough minority vote to get to pass the plan that they were backing

sw2956B-ms98-a-0133 587.250000 592.331250 and we're saying we have low voter turnout maybe it is is uh
sw2956B-ms98-a-0134 592.331250 595.211375 now that we have minorities included in the
