sw2956A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.246500 [noise]
sw2956A-ms98-a-0002 0.246500 10.475250 well i- i been uh i've probably had more time than you have to think about this subject so i'll tell you i[s]- is it a serious problem yes i do believe it's a serious problem however there are solutions to it 
sw2956A-ms98-a-0003 10.475250 18.901625 and foremost uh where we compare w[e]- that we are now doing fifty percent of our uh people are voting uh
sw2956A-ms98-a-0004 18.901625 30.858750 we're probably making a comparison against uh some European and uh and uh uh say newer republics that uh that have very high percentages
sw2956A-ms98-a-0005 30.858750 35.369875 uh so uh one of the reasons that that uh
sw2956A-ms98-a-0006 35.369875 48.457750 o[ne]- one of the reasons that we could get uh one of the reasons that it is lower in the United States is that mostly we hold it on Tuesdays God knows why we hold it on Tuesdays and then we further complicate it by saying you know we'll keep the polls open until eight o'clock
sw2956A-ms98-a-0007 48.457750 62.299125 most people uh a great number of people now work at various at different jobs that if a third of the people are shift workers they won't be able to get to the to the polls in any case if they uh have to work late into the evening and not get up
sw2956A-ms98-a-0008 62.299125 71.220000 my solution to that is that we hold it on Sundays as do probably sixty to seventy percent of the European countries now
sw2956A-ms98-a-0009 71.220000 84.066375 they hold it on the week no they hold it on a either a Saturday or a Sunday or at least a day when when uh a great number of people aren't working in in America that's not true because a a great number of people work on Sundays
sw2956A-ms98-a-0010 84.066375 87.326875 but but that's one of my solutions so
sw2956A-ms98-a-0011 87.326875 99.675000 [silence]
sw2956A-ms98-a-0012 99.675000 111.471125 have you absentee voted in in in Texas well i have absentee voted in uh New Hampshire and it's a fairly fairly complicated process where you have to go pick up the ballot
sw2956A-ms98-a-0013 111.471125 124.069875 i don't say it's that complicated but part of the process also is that you must register preregister at some particular point New Hampshire is fairly easy but other states you have to register every couple of years and uh
sw2956A-ms98-a-0014 124.069875 137.233375 well to vote to vote to just vote so registrations are perhaps a a problem also and we're the mobile mobile society uh people are always mo[bile]- you know one out of every seven people moves [laughter-every] [laughter-year]
sw2956A-ms98-a-0015 137.233375 149.291125 uh that's almost a fourteen percent turnover every you know if you compound that that uh if it is difficult to register to vote that would remove your eligibility to vote
sw2956A-ms98-a-0016 149.291125 154.511500 [silence]
sw2956A-ms98-a-0017 154.511500 155.810000 well
sw2956A-ms98-a-0018 155.810000 161.124500 [silence]
sw2956A-ms98-a-0019 161.124500 167.328625 well maybe that's another factor the motivational factor the motivational factor is probably i
sw2956A-ms98-a-0020 167.328625 175.164750 well that's diminished by w[e]- we've noticed this in particular i i'm just read two books one of them is Whose Stars and Stripes Now
sw2956A-ms98-a-0021 175.164750 182.373125 the uh trivial pursuit of the presidency in nineteen eighty eight it's a fairly decent book i mean it's uh
sw2956A-ms98-a-0022 182.373125 193.882500 it's preceded by uh several other books by these guys uh Wake Me Up When It's Over was about the eighty four elections and i forget what [laughter-the] [laughter-other] [laughter-books] [laughter-were] but any case uh i[t]- i[t]- it's uh
sw2956A-ms98-a-0023 193.882500 203.410750 uh the [vocalized-noise] uh uh there was the Blue Smoke and Mirrors was the one in eighty two uh they these guys uh have taken the place of Theodore White on reporting elections
sw2956A-ms98-a-0024 203.410750 213.110375 in any case they say that uh there's a definite trend uh well you know toward candidates using negative voting it's the only way that you can use television effectively
sw2956A-ms98-a-0025 213.110375 219.988875 [silence]
sw2956A-ms98-a-0026 219.988875 224.020625 no the public would rather hear something negative about the other guy
sw2956A-ms98-a-0027 224.020625 235.265000 th[an]- uh than than a positive factor and y[ou]- and you know to if you if you go on the attack and and put some sensational thing before the public as Mike Dukakis learned in the last campaign 
sw2956A-ms98-a-0028 235.265000 243.950000 and it's not refuted people will you know uh believe it if you don't refute it as he didn't that that there must be some truth to the matter see 
sw2956A-ms98-a-0029 243.950000 245.339000 [silence]
sw2956A-ms98-a-0030 245.339000 252.988125 well he didn't refute it until the last two weeks of the campaign he didn't believe anybody would believe that and indeed his trend started upward
sw2956A-ms98-a-0031 252.988125 254.902500 well they do
sw2956A-ms98-a-0032 254.902500 259.553625 [silence]
sw2956A-ms98-a-0033 259.553625 266.268750 well don't give too much credit to the American public for their motivational ability and and and it
sw2956A-ms98-a-0034 266.268750 267.324375 [silence]
sw2956A-ms98-a-0035 267.324375 279.097500 well it uh well i don't know is it working i mean that's that's the question i guess the question also is that we discovered is that they don't throw rascals out everybody seems disappointed but they don't throw the rascal out their own rascal
sw2956A-ms98-a-0036 279.097500 282.214375 uh my my solution to
sw2956A-ms98-a-0037 282.214375 285.305250 to part of this is is to
sw2956A-ms98-a-0038 285.305250 295.582000 to make it an e[conomic]- economic incentive for people to vote that sounds rather crass i think because then then you're saying well uh
sw2956A-ms98-a-0039 295.582000 306.870375 you know y[ou]- [vocalized-noise] it could be c[onvoluted]- convoluted in many ways where people would actually uh by paying them i mean you know you take a certain amount off their income tax or property tax or whatever
sw2956A-ms98-a-0040 306.870375 314.005875 but that it would be very difficult to administer because i'm sure that any time money and votes are involved [laughter-it] [laughter-just] the whole thing just stinks
sw2956A-ms98-a-0041 314.005875 339.393000 [silence]
sw2956A-ms98-a-0042 339.393000 346.790625 yeah but the idea is to get the individual to the polls and and and we have to make it as easy as possible for him to get to the polls
sw2956A-ms98-a-0043 346.790625 361.477000 [silence]
sw2956A-ms98-a-0044 361.477000 364.015375 oh you mean the special interest groups
sw2956A-ms98-a-0045 364.015375 379.570500 [silence]
sw2956A-ms98-a-0046 379.570500 392.306000 well read my lips and and and no new taxes and yet Bush did that but i mean but but he's excused from that generally people i've read polls now where they've excused him because there was a a definite necessity to balance the budget
sw2956A-ms98-a-0047 392.306000 394.331250 [silence]
sw2956A-ms98-a-0048 394.331250 401.489000 oh he he he gave it that he he did he did he promised the best he could and he's the president and he should 
sw2956A-ms98-a-0049 401.489000 415.164750 he should address those problems and if there needs to be a change in a period of time why what was so funny about it is that i guess that it happened so rapidly you know he knew it he actually knew it and being associated with government he should be held up to the light for that and maybe he will
sw2956A-ms98-a-0050 415.164750 416.281250 [silence]
sw2956A-ms98-a-0051 416.281250 419.289500 but i think it's uh i mean i think you 
sw2956A-ms98-a-0052 419.289500 431.121750 you still have a view that the American voter is different from other voters and he's motivated because we happen to be the cradle of liberty and all that i think voters are motivated uh
sw2956A-ms98-a-0053 431.121750 437.696125 [silence]
sw2956A-ms98-a-0054 437.696125 445.408375 well i don't know if they have higher turnouts overall i don't think England has i think England has about a seventy percent sixty five percent turn out
sw2956A-ms98-a-0055 445.408375 452.976000 i think that we just discovered in this in in the Indian elections is one of the greatest and massive things in the in the world
sw2956A-ms98-a-0056 452.976000 460.347500 uh just it was got vi[olent]- more violent every year they went down to almost fifty percent in this election before they blew up Gandhi but
sw2956A-ms98-a-0057 460.347500 463.808500 simply because people were so concerned about
sw2956A-ms98-a-0058 463.808500 467.402125 their inability that to that their vote doesn't count anyway
sw2956A-ms98-a-0059 467.402125 471.501250 and the corruption of politics in in in that situation 
sw2956A-ms98-a-0060 471.501250 484.865125 but then but you know everything is relative to when uh [vocalized-noise] you know we had higher turnouts because at that time we [vocalized-noise] talk about the turnout relative to the eligible voter right 
sw2956A-ms98-a-0061 484.865125 490.469500 i mean is but but before these enormous before this Voting Rights Act
sw2956A-ms98-a-0062 490.469500 500.442125 what we had was a a great deal of our population uh mainly the Blacks in the South and the Hispanics were precluded by
sw2956A-ms98-a-0063 500.442125 507.422500 by uh voting laws uh from reg[istering]- from their eligibility to register now everybody's available
sw2956A-ms98-a-0064 507.422500 516.767125 so if you really computed it they probably when we said we had a seventy percent turnout in nineteen fifty we really only had a fifty percent turnout because all the eligible voters
sw2956A-ms98-a-0065 516.767125 522.420250 you know the it was skewed by the eligible voters being less than the total population of
sw2956A-ms98-a-0066 522.420250 529.182500 [silence]
sw2956A-ms98-a-0067 529.182500 535.343375 no i think the high there's a higher percentage in in certain Black areas of voters i don't know about Hispanics you know
sw2956A-ms98-a-0068 535.343375 536.602000 i just
sw2956A-ms98-a-0069 536.602000 541.419125 i- i mean i haven't studied the statistics well enough to i mean i think in this sort of a
sw2956A-ms98-a-0070 541.419125 544.897375 conversation we can only do our own reactions
sw2956A-ms98-a-0071 544.897375 552.502750 [silence]
sw2956A-ms98-a-0072 552.502750 553.809000 um-hum
sw2956A-ms98-a-0073 553.809000 584.120875 [silence]
sw2956A-ms98-a-0074 584.120875 585.472750 what do you mean
sw2956A-ms98-a-0075 585.472750 593.182250 [silence]
sw2956A-ms98-a-0076 593.182250 595.923250 you know Karen i wonder if we are recording
sw2956A-ms98-a-0077 595.923250 597.024625 [silence]
sw2956A-ms98-a-0078 597.024625 600.868625 i did press one but usually by this time they tell me that the time is u[p]-
