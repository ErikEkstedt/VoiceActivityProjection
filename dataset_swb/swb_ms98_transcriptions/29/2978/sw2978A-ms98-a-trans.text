sw2978A-ms98-a-0007 33.481125 39.655500 you know there['s]- there's always at least one or two good hail [laughter-storms] [laughter-before] [laughter-the] [laughter-season] ends
sw2978A-ms98-a-0008 39.655500 45.284500 yeah last Thursday though it was just raining buckets

sw2978A-ms98-a-0031 121.524625 130.071375 right oh boy i know tha[t]- it's been about_1 eight years ago i guess now right here in Dallas
sw2978A-ms98-a-0032 130.071375 138.902000 i guess it was late May temperatures got up into the nineties and by early June it was rocking a hundred and it stayed that way till September
sw2978A-ms98-a-0033 138.902000 142.862750 we had ninety one consecutive hundred degree days
sw2978A-ms98-a-0034 142.862750 148.569875 and i didn't know whether we would survive at all oh but
sw2978A-ms98-a-0035 148.569875 150.840250 [silence]
sw2978A-ms98-a-0036 150.840250 158.628625 well actually you know we affect our humidity a great deal this at one time wasn't a real humid area
sw2978A-ms98-a-0037 158.628625 170.530125 but we've built a lot of lakes and a lot of reservoirs and that increases the relative humidity i mean it if it's there to evaporate it's going to go up into the air and the hotter it gets the more evaporates
sw2978A-ms98-a-0038 170.530125 182.769500 [silence]
sw2978A-ms98-a-0039 182.769500 193.583000 well we have attempted to reforest some areas but as a matter of fact at one time this was uh a very dense forest in this area and
sw2978A-ms98-a-0040 193.583000 205.868375 for farming and for construction and things a lot of the forests have been cut down and then of course you know they bulldozed a bunch of forest when they dug out the [laughter-reservoir] [laughter] [laughter-moisture] [noise]
sw2978A-ms98-a-0041 205.868375 214.324375 but for the most part we have very mild Winters here we may get one snow storm i may actually see white on the ground one day
sw2978A-ms98-a-0042 214.324375 228.015250 but if it even ices [laughter-over] a half an inch worth of ice or just a little bit of snow man businesses close down traffic comes to a snarl i mean nothing happens if it gets enough snow you can see it on the ground
sw2978A-ms98-a-0043 228.015250 229.920500 [silence]
sw2978A-ms98-a-0044 229.920500 232.420750 um oh

sw2978A-ms98-a-0054 251.583250 254.452625 that's true they sure do
sw2978A-ms98-a-0055 254.452625 261.654125 um-hum well you know the one of the things i have noticed is that the weather changes over time as well i was raised in Amarillo
sw2978A-ms98-a-0056 261.654125 273.924375 and i can remember when there was really only one snow storm a year in Amarillo it started in October and stopped in March or M[ay]- April [noise] and it you know there stayed snow on the ground all Winter long to to sun depth
sw2978A-ms98-a-0057 273.924375 282.641250 but actually that has changed considerably uh the the Winters are no less cold but they're dryer
sw2978A-ms98-a-0058 282.641250 290.145375 [silence]
sw2978A-ms98-a-0059 290.145375 291.400000 um-hum

sw2978A-ms98-a-0068 308.853500 312.546250 [silence]
sw2978A-ms98-a-0069 312.546250 321.720250 oh wow that's something well i don't think there was a single day out this year for our kids they i don't they don't put ten in there i think they put three
sw2978A-ms98-a-0070 321.720250 335.152500 but good grief here three days for snow days actually one year before last they took a [laughter-snow] day because it was flooding [laughter] uh Spring flood and they just couldn't get to school so they just canceled school
sw2978A-ms98-a-0071 335.152500 348.205500 so there's just too many we're in a a very uh they're low hills you don't notice them_1 because of the trees and because of the so many buildings built around but there's a lot of hills around here which means there's a lot of gullies which means there's a lot of creeks and a lot of flooding
sw2978A-ms98-a-0072 348.205500 349.327500 [silence]
sw2978A-ms98-a-0073 349.327500 359.590000 and uh [vocalized-noise] that can create almost as big a hazard and [laughter-i] drive a little Nissan when it floods it drowns [laughter]
sw2978A-ms98-a-0074 359.590000 365.334000 [silence]
sw2978A-ms98-a-0075 365.334000 373.175500 well yes uh anytime there's a storm there's going to be plenty of it yeah one of the

sw2978A-ms98-a-0084 405.763125 419.523000 well i am a little bit concerned this last week our temperatures not drop down below the upper seventies at night which means that y[ou]- you know we could be looking for a very warm Summer i really don't want that [laughter]
