sw2978B-ms98-a-0038 239.722500 253.508250 snow two you know uh three to five inches all the time or q[uite]- quite often they seem to be able to handle it when they have it like that but here uh the schools close when there's half an inch of snow [laughter] and uh
sw2978B-ms98-a-0039 253.508250 256.451625 everything else closes down so uh

sw2978B-ms98-a-0045 281.745375 290.996000 right right yes it's been the same way here uh we haven't had nearly as severe uh a Winter in the last five years even
sw2978B-ms98-a-0046 290.996000 300.352375 than we had uh i've been in Maryland for twenty years so uh um i['d]- i'd say when i first came here you know i[t]- it was quite
sw2978B-ms98-a-0047 300.352375 313.290625 common to have several snows and uh you know they they build in uh ten snow days for our kids back here in the school and uh the last three years they haven't taken but one day
sw2978B-ms98-a-0048 313.290625 316.015250 so uh it has
sw2978B-ms98-a-0049 316.015250 320.936250 [silence]

sw2978B-ms98-a-0059 355.810250 366.213750 ooh yes right you wouldn't wanna [laughter-you] wouldn't want to go through too many puddles do you have much uh m[any]- many pr[oblems]- problems with um lightning uh with electric storms there
sw2978B-ms98-a-0060 366.213750 369.995375 [silence]
sw2978B-ms98-a-0061 369.995375 375.945750 oh really okay because of that that's one thing that we have here see i'm originally from California so the contrast between
sw2978B-ms98-a-0062 375.945750 384.947375 the lightning storms i experienced there and the lightning storms back here where it hits in the back [laughter-yard] you know uh uh have been uh quite an experience but um
sw2978B-ms98-a-0063 384.947375 397.667750 uh we seem to have a lot this time of year we seem to have a lot of uh where it's still i mean last night it went down to sixty degrees but it's ninety it's it's eighty two right now here so uh yeah
sw2978B-ms98-a-0064 397.667750 407.200500 yes so it the the contrast in the Spring is so uh you know different i guess that it uh breeds some uh
sw2978B-ms98-a-0065 407.200500 412.753875 [silence]
sw2978B-ms98-a-0066 412.753875 414.327625 um-hum

sw2978B-ms98-a-0068 416.010125 417.584500 yeah
sw2978B-ms98-a-0069 417.584500 429.867375 no i don't either [laughter-i] [laughter-know] [laughter-what] [laughter-you] [laughter-mean] [laughter-because] electric bills go up and [laughter] in fact uh i was at my daughter's on Sunday and they had their first brown out uh it just electricity just went off for about twenty minutes and then came back on
sw2978B-ms98-a-0070 429.867375 434.534500 but it went off in the whole neighborhood so uh uh it's this isn't uh
sw2978B-ms98-a-0071 434.534500 447.622250 this is still May it's not a real good time of year to [laughter-start] you know because uh uh it kind of looks for the but the the Summers have been longer and um hotter
sw2978B-ms98-a-0072 447.622250 449.625250 i think that a lot of it has to do with
