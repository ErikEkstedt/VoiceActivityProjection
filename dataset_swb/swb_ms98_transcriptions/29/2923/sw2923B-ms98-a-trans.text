sw2923B-ms98-a-0017 61.523500 71.466750 it just seems like instruments playing all at once to five different scores of music do you know what i mean like didn't seem like it was meant what
sw2923B-ms98-a-0018 71.466750 78.722375 yeah it's noi[se]- it just doesn't seem like it was supposed to be played at the same time together or that someone isn't tuned or whatever
sw2923B-ms98-a-0019 78.722375 82.364625 but um i have to admit i do love top forty

sw2923B-ms98-a-0021 84.221375 89.184125 although i don't watch MTV i do love that type of music but
sw2923B-ms98-a-0022 89.184125 94.455625 i feel like it's the best music that you can sing along to and dance and
sw2923B-ms98-a-0023 94.455625 103.501375 and um i'm an aerobics freak so i just uh i love that type of music to do aerobics to and exercise and that sort of thing
