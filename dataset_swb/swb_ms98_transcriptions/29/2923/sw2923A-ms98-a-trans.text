sw2923A-ms98-a-0049 233.778875 235.286000 i've been
sw2923A-ms98-a-0050 235.286000 236.293750 [silence]
sw2923A-ms98-a-0051 236.293750 239.327000 well you know i listen to it but i won't go buy it
sw2923A-ms98-a-0052 239.327000 246.086375 i've i've like i've been exposed to so many new and different bands lately just through this new radio station that
sw2923A-ms98-a-0053 246.086375 252.847500 i realize there's just a lot of a lot of things i've i never would have heard or even thought of looking at or listening to
sw2923A-ms98-a-0054 252.847500 254.108750 and
sw2923A-ms98-a-0055 254.108750 255.666000 [silence]
sw2923A-ms98-a-0056 255.666000 260.182000 oh i'm trying to think of a good example one that won't get me into too much trouble
sw2923A-ms98-a-0057 260.182000 261.446625 um
sw2923A-ms98-a-0058 261.446625 262.980750 [laughter-yeah]
sw2923A-ms98-a-0059 262.980750 275.475250 be a bad example like for example the Vi[olent]- Violent Femmes they've been around for a while and they've just started playing some new music of theirs and it made me go out and buy some and listen to it i won't say i like the whole album really but uh 
sw2923A-ms98-a-0060 275.475250 282.591875 [silence]
sw2923A-ms98-a-0061 282.591875 284.033375 um-hum

sw2923A-ms98-a-0064 312.834250 321.216125 the only thing i like about Madonna is i think if if i was given a ticket to see her perform i think she'd be entertaining to see perform
sw2923A-ms98-a-0065 321.216125 331.708375 but i don't i don't really care for her music there's one or two songs that i like you know for a while until they overplayed them_1 to death but uh i've never been a big Madonna fan
sw2923A-ms98-a-0066 331.708375 336.061625 but i do think if someone gave me a ticket it'd be a really entertaining show
sw2923A-ms98-a-0067 336.061625 339.325000 i wouldn't go stand in line or sleep overnight at the
