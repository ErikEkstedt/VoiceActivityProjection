sw2945B-ms98-a-0027 82.291125 84.447875 yeah i understand that yeah
sw2945B-ms98-a-0028 84.447875 87.229250 they really grow up quick especially at that early age
sw2945B-ms98-a-0029 87.229250 88.246000 [silence]
sw2945B-ms98-a-0030 88.246000 100.425750 but my my wife was uh she worked part time when my oldest was was little and now she's staying home all the time but uh that worked out really well because it's a big transition i think to have children
sw2945B-ms98-a-0031 100.425750 108.651250 you know to go from you know nothing you know if you want to do something every night that's fine but when you have children it doesn't work that way anymore so
sw2945B-ms98-a-0032 108.651250 119.493250 [silence]
sw2945B-ms98-a-0033 119.493250 120.705500 yeah yeah

sw2945B-ms98-a-0035 123.268000 125.299875 yeah i agree with you i
sw2945B-ms98-a-0036 125.299875 127.599625 i i think that
sw2945B-ms98-a-0037 127.599625 137.176250 my wife leaned that way and i'm really glad she did and you know i'm glad she's staying home but you know i know there are some days when she wi[shes]- she wishes she was back at work but 
sw2945B-ms98-a-0038 137.176250 140.765500 [vocalized-noise]

sw2945B-ms98-a-0041 143.315875 153.125000 yeah well see that's that's why i'm glad my wife did too because_1 she worked either two to thr[ee]- three days a week and that got her out of the house and yet she'd get to spend you know
sw2945B-ms98-a-0042 153.125000 156.614000 three or four days with yeah yeah and so

sw2945B-ms98-a-0044 160.169750 165.179500 yeah i do to i agree but then when you start having two of them it's you know a little bit tougher
sw2945B-ms98-a-0045 165.179500 168.568250 because you've got to make a little more money to make that payoff and stuff

sw2945B-ms98-a-0073 229.810625 234.162000 yeah what uh my wife did some teaching at like uh
sw2945B-ms98-a-0074 234.162000 236.246000 like a private tutoring place
sw2945B-ms98-a-0075 236.246000 242.796750 a Sylvan Learning Center this year and so that that got me to sp[end]- to be able to spend more time with the kids at night and stuff you know 
sw2945B-ms98-a-0076 242.796750 245.576625 because_1 normally if if they need something they just go to mom
sw2945B-ms98-a-0077 245.576625 249.313625 no matter what it is i mean i cou[ld]- i'm perfectly capable of doing it for them but
sw2945B-ms98-a-0078 249.313625 252.247375 it's so much easier to go to mom i guess they get used to it
sw2945B-ms98-a-0079 252.247375 256.354750 so but you know we'd go to the library and do things like that yeah 
sw2945B-ms98-a-0080 256.354750 257.359000 but
sw2945B-ms98-a-0081 257.359000 270.784750 [silence]

sw2945B-ms98-a-0106 331.440125 332.518750 [silence]
sw2945B-ms98-a-0107 332.518750 335.344250 um you know it's it's hard because you know then 
sw2945B-ms98-a-0108 335.344250 340.896500 you're not getting to spend as much time with at home i mean your husband is not getting to spend as much time at home as he'd want to
sw2945B-ms98-a-0109 340.896500 346.600750 so yeah that that's a tough situation but then then again you know some you got to do what you got to do
sw2945B-ms98-a-0110 346.600750 348.383625 you know to get along too so
sw2945B-ms98-a-0111 348.383625 352.399750 [silence]
sw2945B-ms98-a-0112 352.399750 362.294500 uh-huh we[ll]- well like i said my wife normally feels that way there are days when uh i come home and she says here take these kids i'm getting out
sw2945B-ms98-a-0113 362.294500 365.427625 so she's she's had about enough during those days
sw2945B-ms98-a-0114 365.427625 377.235625 but but for the most part i you know i've really feel like that's led the way that you know what just like what you said with the cost of living and everything i think a lot of people can't afford to get by on just one salary an
sw2945B-ms98-a-0115 377.235625 378.532125 and won't
sw2945B-ms98-a-0116 378.532125 385.753500 and so i think that's le[d]- tended to lead to a decline in in families and family values especially
sw2945B-ms98-a-0117 385.753500 391.902375 and i really think that that's one of the problems the nation's facing that you know we need to do something about but i don't know what
sw2945B-ms98-a-0118 391.902375 395.970000 [silence]
sw2945B-ms98-a-0119 395.970000 396.778625 yeah

sw2945B-ms98-a-0123 406.630375 407.629250 uh-huh
sw2945B-ms98-a-0124 407.629250 413.301375 [silence]
sw2945B-ms98-a-0125 413.301375 414.967250 uh-huh
sw2945B-ms98-a-0126 414.967250 419.284000 it's amazing how your whole focus on life changes after you've had a child
sw2945B-ms98-a-0127 419.284000 427.564125 [silence]
sw2945B-ms98-a-0128 427.564125 428.301000 uh-huh

sw2945B-ms98-a-0130 429.220750 440.077500 well you know in the next year or so you'll see so many instances where you know he'll mimic something that you've done and you see you know everything i'm doing he's learning from
sw2945B-ms98-a-0131 440.077500 445.458375 and and you think if i wasn't here he'd be learning that from a babysitter or from a day care
sw2945B-ms98-a-0132 445.458375 453.741375 you know th[ey]- that's how they're developing their patterns and i think a lot of people either don't care or don't realize it you know that's
sw2945B-ms98-a-0133 453.741375 454.747875 [silence]
