sw2918A-ms98-a-0010 35.205875 48.578500 well uh i was just thinking as i was listening to this recording go over and over till they found a party for me to talk to [laughter] i could talk about a dinner party i had uh Sunday
sw2918A-ms98-a-0011 48.578500 54.715250 and it included some seafood so that would probably be uh appropriate for you
sw2918A-ms98-a-0012 54.715250 63.388500 uh i had uh some people from Germany visiting and they are uh fans of American shrimp
sw2918A-ms98-a-0013 63.388500 74.797750 so i did a kind of a stir fry dish with shrimp that you shake up in a bag with a little parmesan cheese and flour and then uh quickly
sw2918A-ms98-a-0014 74.797750 87.505250 uh fry up in a little olive oil and then uh take out of the wok put some uh red strips of red pepper and green pepper in
sw2918A-ms98-a-0015 87.505250 100.150500 stir that a little bit uh add some uh sliced mushrooms and then put the shrimp back in with a half a cup of white wine and just bring it to a simmer
sw2918A-ms98-a-0016 100.150500 105.969875 and then you serve it on rice and it's really a a pretty low cholesterol dish
sw2918A-ms98-a-0017 105.969875 113.220625 because its done with the uh shrimp and the olive oil you don't use any kind of beef fat or
sw2918A-ms98-a-0018 113.220625 116.234500 no no animal fats in it
sw2918A-ms98-a-0019 116.234500 123.664250 And it's very popular and it looks very pretty and uh with rice and a salad you've got a a meal
sw2918A-ms98-a-0020 123.664250 132.897875 [silence]
sw2918A-ms98-a-0021 132.897875 134.544125 um

sw2918A-ms98-a-0031 175.640375 186.267250 oh i wish i had the recipe for my grandmother's gumbo she used to make the most wonderful crab meat gumbo with shrimp and all sorts of other goodies in it
sw2918A-ms98-a-0032 186.267250 188.790750 My job was picking the crab
sw2918A-ms98-a-0033 188.790750 192.571375 [laughter] not my favorite part [laughter]

sw2918A-ms98-a-0041 229.992250 243.237375 well the reason for using those is that it makes such a pretty colorful dish People always exclaim when you have the red and green peppers and if i'm making a whole lot uh i use a yellow pepper as well
sw2918A-ms98-a-0042 243.237375 254.369875 for one pound of shrimp i use one red pepper one green pepper and oh maybe half a dozen ten mushrooms medium sized mushrooms
sw2918A-ms98-a-0043 254.369875 260.436000 and that's plenty for four people and if they're light eaters you can squeeze in six
sw2918A-ms98-a-0044 260.436000 261.723125 but
sw2918A-ms98-a-0045 261.723125 265.997625 [silence]
sw2918A-ms98-a-0046 265.997625 279.407125 oh yeah that's good uh my husband is a Chinese cook he doesn't do much cooking either but he loves to cook Chinese and he has a marvelous uh chicken with cashews and
sw2918A-ms98-a-0047 279.407125 286.531375 and the Szechuan peppers now those are not the hot ones those are the little round pink ones
sw2918A-ms98-a-0048 286.531375 297.724625 and oh they are wonderful that uh he does that uh uh chicken with cashews and Szechuan peppers and he also not at the same meal
sw2918A-ms98-a-0049 297.724625 306.716250 [laughter] does a wonderful vegetable dish with Szechuan peppers but use that uses either asparagus or um
sw2918A-ms98-a-0050 306.716250 318.451625 [noise] let's see what does he use asparagus is the one we like the best oh broccoli you can do the same dish with broccoli and also if you're really in a pinch you can do it with just celery
sw2918A-ms98-a-0051 318.451625 320.171625 and it's pretty good
sw2918A-ms98-a-0052 320.171625 326.150000 [silence]
sw2918A-ms98-a-0053 326.150000 327.535250 uh-huh

sw2918A-ms98-a-0058 352.719375 366.156000 oh i like them too i think they're great uh we i've been trying to convince the cook at uh at the place where i work uh we are kind of isolated and so we don't go out to lunch very often
sw2918A-ms98-a-0059 366.156000 376.200375 and we do have an excellent kitchen uh which is encouraging for people to stay around and uh eat and interact with one another at lunch we're a think tank
sw2918A-ms98-a-0060 376.200375 389.599875 so that's one of our functions is to get people to talk to each other and she has started cooking uh much healthier food m[uch]- much more uh salad without mayonnaise and 
sw2918A-ms98-a-0061 389.599875 392.605250 uh much more uh [noise]
sw2918A-ms98-a-0062 392.605250 399.931875 main dishes without oils and uh and the vegetable i mean and uh animal fats
sw2918A-ms98-a-0063 399.931875 407.043875 so i think we're improving our diets i don't know whether it's the California influence or whether it's everywhere but
sw2918A-ms98-a-0064 407.043875 417.043625 [silence]
sw2918A-ms98-a-0065 417.043625 418.852375 uh-huh
sw2918A-ms98-a-0066 418.852375 430.056750 well my husband's cholesterol is not real high but he his father had uh an early heart attack and so he is very conscious of his
sw2918A-ms98-a-0067 430.056750 439.718250 uh physical condition and he walks a lot and tries to get uh to stay in pretty good shape and to watch out for high cholesterol and
sw2918A-ms98-a-0068 439.718250 449.045875 since i prefer the kinds of foods that one eats on a m[oderately]- moderately low cholesterol diet anyway that suits me just fine
sw2918A-ms98-a-0069 449.045875 455.529625 [silence]
sw2918A-ms98-a-0070 455.529625 458.082000 um yeah yeah

sw2918A-ms98-a-0074 474.275750 487.333500 yeah we don't either we just eat it once in a great while and uh it's usually if we're having company and it's somebody that we know is a big meat [laughter] fan but there're fewer and fewer of those
sw2918A-ms98-a-0075 487.333500 495.077875 so we also do an awful lot of cooking when it's just the two of us on a little tiny uh [noise] grill it's
sw2918A-ms98-a-0076 495.077875 509.822750 oh it's less than a foot long and about eight inches wide and uh we just put a few charcoals in there and uh we can cook a piece of chicken we buy boneless chicken breasts and save us ourselves a lot of time
sw2918A-ms98-a-0077 509.822750 514.762500 And that with uh do have you ever tried Lawrey's Lemon Pepper
sw2918A-ms98-a-0078 514.762500 517.691250 you can buy it in the grocery store
sw2918A-ms98-a-0079 517.691250 519.182625 [silence]

sw2918A-ms98-a-0082 524.020375 526.578875 well it has sea salt in it
sw2918A-ms98-a-0083 526.578875 537.147125 and but it's not the same as uh they have the Lawrey's seasoned salt and the Lawrey's season[ing]- Lemon Pepper and the Lemon Pepper's the one i love on chicken and fish
sw2918A-ms98-a-0084 537.147125 539.080875 and uh yeah just
sw2918A-ms98-a-0085 539.080875 550.395250 barely brush it with oil grill it uh so it's not too done and sprinkle a little of that on it and then i add some lemon thyme from my garden
sw2918A-ms98-a-0086 550.395250 555.613000 [noise] and that makes an excellent and very easy to fix
sw2918A-ms98-a-0087 555.613000 556.872125 dinner
