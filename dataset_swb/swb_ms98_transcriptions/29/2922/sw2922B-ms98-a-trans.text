sw2922B-ms98-a-0005 3.194000 8.206250 well i think we're we have pretty much narrowed it down to a Mazda minivan
sw2922B-ms98-a-0006 8.206250 11.269875 the new uh the uh M P V
sw2922B-ms98-a-0007 11.269875 14.530375 the uh the one that's the all wheel drive
sw2922B-ms98-a-0008 14.530375 16.265500 yes
sw2922B-ms98-a-0009 16.265500 22.562625 [laughter] well we're we do it mainly because we tr[avel]- we do a lot of traveling and i want to do it in comfort
sw2922B-ms98-a-0010 22.562625 30.733375 right now we have we have we have a four door you know sedan but it's just uh it just doesn't have quite as much room and it's not very comfortable to drive long distance in
sw2922B-ms98-a-0011 30.733375 32.890625 [silence]
sw2922B-ms98-a-0012 32.890625 45.047375 well we've we've been looking for about you know two years to decide but you know with the style changes you know they're they're a lot of them are changing right now and we're trying to wait until we see what what it's going to you know the style going to stay for a while
sw2922B-ms98-a-0013 45.047375 49.780875 and uh supposedly the Mazda is going to change this coming year
sw2922B-ms98-a-0014 49.780875 54.123500 and we'll just we'll wait till the ninety twos come out
sw2922B-ms98-a-0015 54.123500 60.009500 no so that's that's pretty much uh you know where we stand now how about how about you
sw2922B-ms98-a-0016 60.009500 98.640250 [silence]
sw2922B-ms98-a-0017 98.640250 99.918750 yeah
sw2922B-ms98-a-0018 99.918750 100.948750 [silence]
sw2922B-ms98-a-0019 100.948750 107.811125 yeah you pretty much have to take advantage of the uh the wild and crazy while you can and then you got to turn into the practical
sw2922B-ms98-a-0020 107.811125 117.020125 that's kind of the way i've had to transition i was into you know the sportier cars and then uh when when when it comes to putting car seats and all that kind of stuff in it you know you just don't uh
sw2922B-ms98-a-0021 117.020125 119.447625 can't get away with it any longer
sw2922B-ms98-a-0022 119.447625 125.845375 or then and then you got to wait until you're you know after your kids are grown and you can scale back down again
sw2922B-ms98-a-0023 125.845375 129.133500 but uh you know right now i have a pickup truck
sw2922B-ms98-a-0024 129.133500 136.559000 and it's one of the supercabs and you can get you can get uh you know k[ids]- kids and everything in there the only thing is it's it's not very comfortable
sw2922B-ms98-a-0025 136.559000 139.980000 [silence]
sw2922B-ms98-a-0026 139.980000 141.617625 yeah
sw2922B-ms98-a-0027 141.617625 150.354750 well they've made some changes over the you know the last couple of years since they've come out this year they're coming out with a new transmission a little bit heavier duty transmission
sw2922B-ms98-a-0028 150.354750 153.473750 which the Japanese are not well known for but uh
sw2922B-ms98-a-0029 153.473750 160.193625 but they're supposedly getting a new uh transmission in fact i think Board Warner's the one that going to going to design it for them
sw2922B-ms98-a-0030 160.193625 169.462750 and that'll that'll help some and uh they're going to change the interior to where the backseat itself can either be removed or laid laying down into a bed
sw2922B-ms98-a-0031 169.462750 171.404250 whereas now it can't
sw2922B-ms98-a-0032 171.404250 174.895875 you can lean it back a little bit but not all the way
sw2922B-ms98-a-0033 174.895875 178.268500 so we're looking at those type things also
sw2922B-ms98-a-0034 178.268500 179.901000 [silence]
sw2922B-ms98-a-0035 179.901000 183.818875 yeah plus you know th[e]- the uh the wheel base uh
sw2922B-ms98-a-0036 183.818875 187.239875 the the way it is right now the all wheel drive 
sw2922B-ms98-a-0037 187.239875 191.663500 the it's a little bit higher up off the ground but they're going to raise it three more inches up 
sw2922B-ms98-a-0038 191.663500 195.400875 and a little bit more clearance
sw2922B-ms98-a-0039 195.400875 201.573750 and uh you know not that i really need it for any but i like sitting up high so you can see
sw2922B-ms98-a-0040 201.573750 208.051375 [silence]
sw2922B-ms98-a-0041 208.051375 209.313250 yes
sw2922B-ms98-a-0042 209.313250 212.828125 [noise] [laughter]
sw2922B-ms98-a-0043 212.828125 231.739250 [silence]
sw2922B-ms98-a-0044 231.739250 232.803250 um
sw2922B-ms98-a-0045 232.803250 235.053250 [silence]
sw2922B-ms98-a-0046 235.053250 236.648625 that's kind of interesting
sw2922B-ms98-a-0047 236.648625 256.942500 [silence]
sw2922B-ms98-a-0048 256.942500 259.996625 forty seven thousand dollars is
sw2922B-ms98-a-0049 259.996625 261.812500 it's a little stiff
sw2922B-ms98-a-0050 261.812500 262.944125 [silence]
sw2922B-ms98-a-0051 262.944125 267.487875 yeah i agree i don't think even if i had the money to spend on it i don't think i'd buy one
sw2922B-ms98-a-0052 267.487875 274.807875 [silence]
sw2922B-ms98-a-0053 274.807875 281.500750 plus nowadays you know y[ou]- it cars are high anyway you know you can't hardly get anything decent for less than you know nineteen or twenty 
sw2922B-ms98-a-0054 281.500750 288.542750 and that's that's a pretty big investment even nowadays and i want something that's going to last me for at least seven eight years
sw2922B-ms98-a-0055 288.542750 290.435750 and uh
sw2922B-ms98-a-0056 290.435750 299.982625 i just can't see you know these people spending these thirty five to forty five thousand dollars on BMWs and Mercedes and then trading them_1 every year or two
sw2922B-ms98-a-0057 299.982625 307.907750 [silence]
sw2922B-ms98-a-0058 307.907750 310.351750 God that's so that's silly
sw2922B-ms98-a-0059 310.351750 313.751625 [silence]
sw2922B-ms98-a-0060 313.751625 321.791125 i uh i- i like i say i d[on't]- i think even if i had the money i wouldn't want something like that it's just not within my it's just it's impractical 
sw2922B-ms98-a-0061 321.791125 324.295375 [silence]
sw2922B-ms98-a-0062 324.295375 331.575375 too many other good things you can do with the money besides waste it uh i just uh you know there's too many people that need things and
sw2922B-ms98-a-0063 331.575375 333.906500 you know places that you can put it
sw2922B-ms98-a-0064 333.906500 336.108250 not not to waste money like that
sw2922B-ms98-a-0065 336.108250 337.537000 [silence]
sw2922B-ms98-a-0066 337.537000 347.123500 yeah i mean it'd be nice to be able to afford it but i i'm just not i even if i had the money i i'm i know for a fact i just wouldn't i wouldn't buy one i just can't bring myself to do that kind of stuff
sw2922B-ms98-a-0067 347.123500 348.878250 but uh
sw2922B-ms98-a-0068 348.878250 358.526125 we try to keep our cars on an average of eight to ten years if we can if we can get by with it we have a Volvo right now that's
sw2922B-ms98-a-0069 358.526125 365.229750 it's seven years old and it's got uh about eighty five thousand miles on it and it still drives like it's brand new
sw2922B-ms98-a-0070 365.229750 367.527000 [noise]
sw2922B-ms98-a-0071 367.527000 376.698625 about that's about right and we we anticipate on keeping that car for hopefully another five six seven years if we can if we can make it go that long
sw2922B-ms98-a-0072 376.698625 381.707500 [silence]
sw2922B-ms98-a-0073 381.707500 386.272000 well Volvos uh there's a lot of them_1 that we in fact we have a mutual friend uh 
sw2922B-ms98-a-0074 386.272000 388.428750 my wife and i that uh
sw2922B-ms98-a-0075 388.428750 393.413500 they uh they just passed three hundred thousand miles on theirs
sw2922B-ms98-a-0076 393.413500 403.179250 it's still mechanically fine now you you know there there's there's money to invest in it during during that three hundred thousand miles you know uh timing chains and and various other things but 
sw2922B-ms98-a-0077 403.179250 409.666875 all in all if you if you take it mileage uh based on what you spent over that life of the car
sw2922B-ms98-a-0078 409.666875 411.842125 relatively cheap
sw2922B-ms98-a-0079 411.842125 413.597375 so uh
sw2922B-ms98-a-0080 413.597375 421.113750 you know i- i so far i can't complain it's been a good car and and we're going we're like i say we'll try to keep it for a long time it's been paid off for several years
sw2922B-ms98-a-0081 421.113750 422.451375 [silence]
sw2922B-ms98-a-0082 422.451375 424.524000 yeah and uh
sw2922B-ms98-a-0083 424.524000 437.006125 the the only other thing is you know the the pickup truck's nice but it's impractical for for traveling and family so we'll get something that we can haul stuff in if we have to and then have it for you know trips and and everything
sw2922B-ms98-a-0084 437.006125 442.633000 [silence]
sw2922B-ms98-a-0085 442.633000 448.830125 well nowadays it pays to shop because you're going to have to live with it for a while you know if you if you're paying for it for three or four years
sw2922B-ms98-a-0086 448.830125 460.440375 uh that's a long time right there in itself and then you don't want to turn around and and you know the next time you buy a car it's going to be more expensive and uh you don't want to start another payment that's going to be up around four or five hundred dollars a month
sw2922B-ms98-a-0087 460.440375 463.850125 so uh it it's it's crazy so
sw2922B-ms98-a-0088 463.850125 465.892250 [silence]
sw2922B-ms98-a-0089 465.892250 470.783125 but the little that eighty two Bonneville that you have that that uh that's probably a pretty good car
sw2922B-ms98-a-0090 470.783125 487.629500 [silence]
sw2922B-ms98-a-0091 487.629500 489.338250 [laughter]

sw2922B-ms98-a-0093 510.513000 516.034750 yeah well you know uh things like that that go out you know if you replace them it's just so costly anyway
sw2922B-ms98-a-0094 516.034750 520.349250 [silence]
sw2922B-ms98-a-0095 520.349250 521.679375 it's crazy
sw2922B-ms98-a-0096 521.679375 522.842375 yeah
sw2922B-ms98-a-0097 522.842375 554.062875 [silence]
sw2922B-ms98-a-0098 554.062875 556.569375 well and your wife has what kind of car
sw2922B-ms98-a-0099 556.569375 557.989000 [silence]
sw2922B-ms98-a-0100 557.989000 559.403500 oh Ferenza
sw2922B-ms98-a-0101 559.403500 564.794500 yeah okay that's Pontiac okay or Olds Firenza yeah
sw2922B-ms98-a-0102 564.794500 572.809250 [silence]

sw2922B-ms98-a-0106 581.861625 586.718000 [silence]
sw2922B-ms98-a-0107 586.718000 592.209375 that's terrible that's one that's one bad thing about living in an area where you have to put salt on the roads
sw2922B-ms98-a-0108 592.209375 594.973625 [silence]
sw2922B-ms98-a-0109 594.973625 596.143625 [laughter-oh]
