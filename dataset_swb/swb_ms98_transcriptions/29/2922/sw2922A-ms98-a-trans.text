sw2922A-ms98-a-0025 91.363625 101.405750 um probably small economical car for a couple of years and then get something bigger like a minivan when when when we have kids and stuff or or or when we travel a lot

sw2922A-ms98-a-0050 199.271000 201.511375 yeah it's actually a real nice feeling
sw2922A-ms98-a-0051 201.511375 205.372500 i uh grew up driving the Suburban and then recently i test drove
sw2922A-ms98-a-0052 205.372500 208.198250 um for some strange reason i test drove a Range Rover 
sw2922A-ms98-a-0053 208.198250 211.256375 not because i was going to buy a forty thousand dollar Jeep mind you
sw2922A-ms98-a-0054 211.256375 216.453875 but just but but because um my my wife works for a temp[orary]- agency and 
sw2922A-ms98-a-0055 216.453875 223.176500 they and and they had a job and they called me basically i basically i was shopping the agent to make sure you know he was doing good things by Range Rover you know 
sw2922A-ms98-a-0056 223.176500 227.392125 they sent me out as a to sort of act like i wanted to buy one
sw2922A-ms98-a-0057 227.392125 232.098375 basically and then report back to the company as to how the salesman is doing
sw2922A-ms98-a-0058 232.098375 236.023875 so i had to act like a buyer and uh
sw2922A-ms98-a-0059 236.023875 240.231000 yeah it's a neat little um it's it's it's 
sw2922A-ms98-a-0060 240.231000 255.180875 it's sort of like being a scab i [laughter-guess] in a sense but uh but i used you know i mean he did a wonderful job so i just went back and said wonderful things about him you know but we went and part of it was test driving a Range Rover and i realized afterward you know it's a real nice ride because it's nice you're nice and high
sw2922A-ms98-a-0061 255.180875 257.954000 lots of clearance and stuff like that like you said but

sw2922A-ms98-a-0063 259.045750 264.500500 forty thousand d[ollars]- yeah that's just way too much for for a jeep in my opinion
sw2922A-ms98-a-0064 264.500500 266.903375 [silence]
sw2922A-ms98-a-0065 266.903375 275.090750 no i wouldn't i mean i would get if i wanted to pick out a car like that i'd go for a Bronco or or or you know Blazer or something i figure it's

sw2922A-ms98-a-0113 462.848500 465.842125 that's that that that's real true actually
sw2922A-ms98-a-0114 465.842125 470.068500 [silence]
sw2922A-ms98-a-0115 470.068500 477.535250 that's that's actually it's got um it's actually it's low on mileage given that that it's eighty two it's only got seventy five thousand on it and uh 
sw2922A-ms98-a-0116 477.535250 484.012000 or seventy four or whatever you know and it's it's in uh it's a funny coincidence that m[y]- my cousin sold me the car
sw2922A-ms98-a-0117 484.012000 498.305125 and she's up for the weekend [laughter-now] [laughter-so] she's out babysitting in the next room [laughter] sort of perfect coincidence it's a perfect time to be talking about that car um but yeah it's just it's just you know i have little problems here and there you know um stupid things start to go like the uh 
sw2922A-ms98-a-0118 498.305125 504.726000 i can't open it it has electronic windows unfortunately electric windows and doors and the uh
sw2922A-ms98-a-0119 504.726000 511.077750 and the passenger window is gone you know it doesn't open any more but i'm not going to fix it because i'm going to sell it in a year
sw2922A-ms98-a-0120 511.077750 514.605375 [silence]
sw2922A-ms98-a-0121 514.605375 518.013125 yeah it's it's it's seventy five dollars for the motor alone
sw2922A-ms98-a-0122 518.013125 531.055375 and then another seventy five to install it you know so that can that that that's crazy or like the air conditioning went the air conditioning sort of blowing warm air so i went down to the you know my local mechanic and for forty dollars they did an air conditioning check and they 
sw2922A-ms98-a-0123 531.055375 544.274125 went through everything i told them to put in a shot of Freon and they said yeah it needs a shot of Freon but then he came back and he said well the reason you're losing the Freon is because you have a leak in this condenser line and when i- and that's a hundred and fifty dollars to fix that and then while we're in there we have to change this this and this and you know and
sw2922A-ms98-a-0124 544.274125 554.342875 so it w[ould]- w[ould]- w[ould]- would have wound up costing me close to four hundred dollars but he said look if you're selling the car in a year don't bother doing it all he said i'll give you a shot of Freon every now and then and and y[ou're]- you're fine you know so
sw2922A-ms98-a-0125 554.342875 555.539500 [silence]
sw2922A-ms98-a-0126 555.539500 560.761500 she has an eighty seven um Ferenza [noise] it's an Olds[mobile]- yeah it's an Oldsmobile 
sw2922A-ms98-a-0127 560.761500 568.082000 yeah no it's Olds actually olds yeah that's actually a real good car i'm finding it's uh mechanically is very sound um
sw2922A-ms98-a-0128 568.082000 573.496375 unfortunately the body was uh rust proofed by a company called Rusty Jones 
sw2922A-ms98-a-0129 573.496375 576.214250 which i'm not sure if you've ever heard of or not but uh
sw2922A-ms98-a-0130 576.214250 580.628250 Rusty Jones went out of business because their rust proofing wasn't very good
sw2922A-ms98-a-0131 580.628250 583.843625 and now i've got some i mean the eighty two has
sw2922A-ms98-a-0132 583.843625 587.987750 no rust at all and the eighty seven has some pretty big rust spots on it so it's
sw2922A-ms98-a-0133 587.987750 589.410125 so and
sw2922A-ms98-a-0134 589.410125 591.998625 [silence]
sw2922A-ms98-a-0135 591.998625 595.275125 yeah actually we're we're looking forward to getting out of here
sw2922A-ms98-a-0136 595.275125 598.957250 we're yeah in a year i'm done and then we're moving south or west
sw2922A-ms98-a-0137 598.957250 599.890500 or southwest
