sw2939B-ms98-a-0021 77.428250 91.308250 yeah well it's uh so far as vegetable gardening is concerned it has been uh many years since i've tried any of that uh i we did have uh we've been in our house uh where we're located now for about fifteen years
sw2939B-ms98-a-0022 91.308250 96.223125 and about uh eight nine
sw2939B-ms98-a-0023 96.223125 100.875250 about nine years ago i guess we put a swimming pool in our backyard
sw2939B-ms98-a-0024 100.875250 103.930000 which means we don't have a backyard anymore [laughter]
sw2939B-ms98-a-0025 103.930000 109.360375 uh so our our gardening is pretty much uh limited to
sw2939B-ms98-a-0026 109.360375 114.127750 plants uh you know shrubs and and trees tha[t]- that kind of gardening
sw2939B-ms98-a-0027 114.127750 115.785625 uh i
sw2939B-ms98-a-0028 115.785625 128.127750 in the years that i did have vegetable gardens there were you know there were times when i had really good gardens and there were times when they just they weren't very good at all and i guess uh the soil and the and the bugs together
sw2939B-ms98-a-0029 128.127750 128.920125 [noise]
sw2939B-ms98-a-0030 128.920125 130.185000 sort of [vocalized-noise]

sw2939B-ms98-a-0032 132.571000 136.330500 um-hum yeah i wouldn't doubt that
sw2939B-ms98-a-0033 136.330500 142.729375 uh i always like to try to grow squash and uh the squash bugs wou[ld]- would just go crazy
sw2939B-ms98-a-0034 142.729375 144.459125 and uh
sw2939B-ms98-a-0035 144.459125 156.305875 and in in my experience with tomatoes was that if i got tomatoes at all they usually got uh sun blisters you know or or it would rain on them_1 and they would bust open you know when the heat hit them_1
sw2939B-ms98-a-0036 156.305875 157.517125 but uh
sw2939B-ms98-a-0037 157.517125 165.357750 [silence]
sw2939B-ms98-a-0038 165.357750 177.234250 yeah but uh but there were you know there were years uh w[e]- i grew uh the little plum salad type tomatoes uh quite a bit and had real good luck with those
sw2939B-ms98-a-0039 177.234250 190.360250 uh one year a[t]- at a the house we lived in before which was also here in Richardson uh we grew okra and i i picked okra up until almost Christmas [laughter]
sw2939B-ms98-a-0040 190.360250 191.575625 [silence]
sw2939B-ms98-a-0041 191.575625 202.677625 yeah and uh and i s[till]- i still occasionally will grow uh jalapeno peppers uh we we like jalapenos and they they grow real well too now you can just stick one of those anywhere
sw2939B-ms98-a-0042 202.677625 204.144375 uh
sw2939B-ms98-a-0043 204.144375 212.728625 one of the things that we're doing talking about uh about lawns and shrubs uh we have a live oak tree in our front yard
sw2939B-ms98-a-0044 212.728625 217.408875 and we just have more trouble getting grass to grow underneath that
sw2939B-ms98-a-0045 217.408875 226.804125 and we're in the process or at least in the planning stage of of putting in a bed around that oak tree
sw2939B-ms98-a-0046 226.804125 234.916500 uh right yeah we're going to just have a ground you know put ground cover and and may[be]- you know maybe a few low plants under there
sw2939B-ms98-a-0047 234.916500 237.039000 [silence]
sw2939B-ms98-a-0048 237.039000 238.179750 right

sw2939B-ms98-a-0052 241.925875 243.320000 [laughter]
sw2939B-ms98-a-0053 243.320000 245.074000 right we uh
sw2939B-ms98-a-0054 245.074000 256.586750 uh uh we uh brought some plants out we're from both from East Texas and we brought some plants in from there and uh o[ne]- one of the things that we brought uh unintentionally was uh violets
sw2939B-ms98-a-0055 256.586750 259.561250 which is l[ike]- almost like a ground cover
sw2939B-ms98-a-0056 259.561250 266.460250 and they really s[pread]- they really spread out and grow uh pretty rapidly when they you know when they're growing well
sw2939B-ms98-a-0057 266.460250 268.180875 but uh
sw2939B-ms98-a-0058 268.180875 273.831750 but they uh they are i guess uh not an annual but a
sw2939B-ms98-a-0059 273.831750 279.995500 they they volunteer to come back every year but they do die off during the winter i've forgotten what the [laughter-term] is for that
sw2939B-ms98-a-0060 279.995500 289.066500 but uh but they do die back during the winter so that you know they are not really very satisfactory for a you know for a full ground cover because of that
sw2939B-ms98-a-0061 289.066500 291.625125 but uh
sw2939B-ms98-a-0062 291.625125 308.094000 [silence]
sw2939B-ms98-a-0063 308.094000 309.863500 um-hum

sw2939B-ms98-a-0065 311.015375 320.735875 yeah um i i don't i'm not familiar with that pear tree uh but it's a non bearing pear is that right yeah
sw2939B-ms98-a-0066 320.735875 326.035000 uh and then the uh of course the leaves drop off during the winter right so
sw2939B-ms98-a-0067 326.035000 340.016250 yeah we have uh we've had real good luck with uh and again these are like volunteer trees that we transplanted from east Texas but we've got a couple uh well we did buy one though we have a couple of red bud trees
sw2939B-ms98-a-0068 340.016250 349.537625 and uh we've got one of those on our patio uh we've got a lot of rock and and around in our one area of our patio
sw2939B-ms98-a-0069 349.537625 357.394375 and we brought a a red bud tree in and it has done very well it has a a a little larger leaf than uh
sw2939B-ms98-a-0070 357.394375 361.988875 maybe even than a pear tree i know it's got larger leaves than a plum tree has
sw2939B-ms98-a-0071 361.988875 368.006000 the uh the leaves are probably uh oh four inches or so in diameter
sw2939B-ms98-a-0072 368.006000 369.528000 and uh
sw2939B-ms98-a-0073 369.528000 372.605125 you know makes a pretty good uh tree i[t]-
sw2939B-ms98-a-0074 372.605125 380.756250 it it has uh of course during the early spring it has the red you know the red flowers that are really pretty
sw2939B-ms98-a-0075 380.756250 390.526875 uh the only problem with it is it does have a seed pod uh you know a little it's a little flat bean type seed pod
sw2939B-ms98-a-0076 390.526875 398.866500 that uh will drop off you know uh when uh when they start drying out so there's a little bit of clean up work for that
sw2939B-ms98-a-0077 398.866500 400.779625 [silence]
sw2939B-ms98-a-0078 400.779625 403.551375 yeah yeah always it's
sw2939B-ms98-a-0079 403.551375 408.973000 uh w[ith]- with our in our case uh it's fairly close to our swimming pool
sw2939B-ms98-a-0080 408.973000 422.719250 and so the uh the flowers uh uh blow in there they don't drop in but they blow into the swimming pool so there's a g[ood]- a good bit of cleanup you know in the swimming pool from that but it's you know it's not too bad even at that so
sw2939B-ms98-a-0081 422.719250 423.820000 [silence]
sw2939B-ms98-a-0082 423.820000 425.983500 right and uh
sw2939B-ms98-a-0083 425.983500 435.125750 but uh yeah we we've really enjoyed that uh the live oak tree that we have uh is in the front and of course the live oak is uh
sw2939B-ms98-a-0084 435.125750 443.224125 it's susceptible to bending by the wind i[t]- it it leans away from the predominant wind direction
sw2939B-ms98-a-0085 443.224125 453.753250 and i think i think you'll find that uh we also have an apple tree uh in our side yard and it does the same thing the the southwestern[ly]- w[inds]- -[southwestern]ly winds
sw2939B-ms98-a-0086 453.753250 458.916250 which are predominant you know during the growing season make both of those trees lean
sw2939B-ms98-a-0087 458.916250 460.912625 toward the northeast
sw2939B-ms98-a-0088 460.912625 474.854500 and uh so it's but that's uh the live oak tree that's you'll find that uh pretty much anywhere that there are if there's a grove of live oaks growing they're going to be leaning away from the you know the direction of the wind
sw2939B-ms98-a-0089 474.854500 476.845250 uh if you
sw2939B-ms98-a-0090 476.845250 491.320375 if you go down along the uh Texas coast there a lot of them_1 grow you know down there and you'll see them_1 and there'll just be like twenty five or thirty of them_1 growing real close together and they'll all every one of them_1 be leaning [laughter-away] [laughter-from] w[ater]- away from the from the water mostly

sw2939B-ms98-a-0111 553.984000 564.059500 yeah what you what you will find uh with the Saint Augustine grass is it's very susceptible to both diseases and to grub worms
sw2939B-ms98-a-0112 564.059500 570.410625 you know uh the the grub worm is the larva of the uh June beetle
sw2939B-ms98-a-0113 570.410625 581.483000 the June bug beetle and uh the grub worms uh in the late spring uh the the beetles come in and and they lay their eggs in the grass
sw2939B-ms98-a-0114 581.483000 588.686625 and then the grub worms come out in the larva stage and they eat the grass off at the roots they eat the roots of the grass off
sw2939B-ms98-a-0115 588.686625 600.372375 and uh w[e]- we had Saint Augustine uh in uh our yard before i mean before we the house we were in before and one year all of the Saint Augustine in our backyard die[d]-
