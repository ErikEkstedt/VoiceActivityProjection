sw2938A-ms98-a-0066 253.218000 264.751625 because of that smoke fumes when i was pregnant with my first little boy i had read it because back then i was walking back and forth to K[entucky]- from well not back and forth i was walking home from uh
sw2938A-ms98-a-0067 264.751625 272.446750 the college i was going to in Kentucky and i was having to walk along the highway it was just one day a week but it was in
sw2938A-ms98-a-0068 272.446750 276.117250 i i have no sense of smell so i couldn't smell this but
sw2938A-ms98-a-0069 276.117250 282.911125 it would make me sick and i'd be real tired anyway just from walking along the highway
sw2938A-ms98-a-0070 282.911125 290.618375 but yeah it's yeah it's all the exhaust uh well that was four years ago too it's probably a lot worse now yeah

sw2938A-ms98-a-0088 355.672375 357.112000 huh
sw2938A-ms98-a-0089 357.112000 369.826375 but they i don't hear much about it down here course Texas we don't have a bunch of [vocalized-noise] pollution but too we've got that air coming in off the coast and you know it'd blow it up north
sw2938A-ms98-a-0090 369.826375 373.793625 so maybe that's part of the reason it's not so bad down here
sw2938A-ms98-a-0091 373.793625 378.066500 but no it'd seem like it would be the same way in on the California coastline wouldn't it

sw2938A-ms98-a-0098 395.887375 401.750125 i think they do that for most everybody it's especially it's usually for the young children and the older
sw2938A-ms98-a-0099 401.750125 403.334750 the old people
