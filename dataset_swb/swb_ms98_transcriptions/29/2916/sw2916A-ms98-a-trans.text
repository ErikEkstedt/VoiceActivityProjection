sw2916A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.004875 [noise]
sw2916A-ms98-a-0002 1.004875 5.951250 i don't think i've ever met anybody that thought they were paying too little taxes [laughter]
sw2916A-ms98-a-0003 5.951250 12.041125 [laughter-so] so i assume that we're going to agree that we all pay too much taxes
sw2916A-ms98-a-0004 12.041125 17.772750 but then the question is are we getting what we pay for and and i think we don't
sw2916A-ms98-a-0005 17.772750 19.089000 [silence]
sw2916A-ms98-a-0006 19.089000 24.510250 i think we pay far too much for bureaucrats and pork barrel projects
sw2916A-ms98-a-0007 24.510250 28.300750 [silence]
sw2916A-ms98-a-0008 28.300750 38.305875 right well i lived in Texas for a long time so i was really hit hard by the nine percent California tacked on to the government's
sw2916A-ms98-a-0009 38.305875 40.105750 [silence]
sw2916A-ms98-a-0010 40.105750 41.419750 yeah
sw2916A-ms98-a-0011 41.419750 55.532500 i know Texas uh just raised their sales tax again because_1 uh i was visiting in Houston over Christmas with my mother and uh uh i w[ent]- bought a few things and i think your sales tax is higher than ours now
sw2916A-ms98-a-0012 55.532500 63.533000 [silence]
sw2916A-ms98-a-0013 63.533000 64.460750 yeah
sw2916A-ms98-a-0014 64.460750 66.761875 [silence]
sw2916A-ms98-a-0015 66.761875 81.039000 well i really do believe that there are huge quantities of money wasted on u[nnecessary]- unnecessary uh bureaucracy and on just flat stupid things
sw2916A-ms98-a-0016 81.039000 81.867500 we h[ave]-
sw2916A-ms98-a-0017 81.867500 95.585250 we have uh hundreds of thousands of dollars going to uh people to supervise people who supervise people who supervise people and when it all comes out they don't do much supervising anyway
sw2916A-ms98-a-0018 95.585250 99.310500 [silence]
sw2916A-ms98-a-0019 99.310500 108.711875 [laughter] well actually as a matter of fact that sort of research i think is worth spending some money on because the uh
sw2916A-ms98-a-0020 108.711875 115.894250 basic research really is what's made our country uh get to where it is in its ability to compete
sw2916A-ms98-a-0021 115.894250 117.252125 [silence]
sw2916A-ms98-a-0022 117.252125 118.690000 no
sw2916A-ms98-a-0023 118.690000 120.753875 [silence]
sw2916A-ms98-a-0024 120.753875 134.841500 well i y[ou]- i don't mind spending on defense for things that work but i mind having pe[ople]- uh uh people spend money to create five thousand pages of documentation to order something
sw2916A-ms98-a-0025 134.841500 136.571375 this is crazy
sw2916A-ms98-a-0026 136.571375 142.522875 [silence]
sw2916A-ms98-a-0027 142.522875 143.598875 yeah
sw2916A-ms98-a-0028 143.598875 147.062000 [silence]
sw2916A-ms98-a-0029 147.062000 148.754875 exactly
sw2916A-ms98-a-0030 148.754875 153.020750 [silence]
sw2916A-ms98-a-0031 153.020750 165.534125 yeah i think the six hundred dollar toilet seat is probably a legitimate expenditure given what the government requires of the manufacturer the manufacturer's probably not making very much profit on that
sw2916A-ms98-a-0032 165.534125 175.863500 but th[e]- probably five hundred dollars of that toilet seat is going to uh ridiculous kinds of of paper work and supervision
sw2916A-ms98-a-0033 175.863500 181.143375 um are are you familiar with the Grace Commission
sw2916A-ms98-a-0034 181.143375 189.252375 well i don't remember exactly w[hen]- when that started but it was back in the early eighties i think uh
sw2916A-ms98-a-0035 189.252375 197.771000 Peter Grace of WJ Grace and Company was uh appointed by i believe Reagan to um
sw2916A-ms98-a-0036 197.771000 206.283250 create a commission to investigate government purchasing and expenditures and see if there wasn't a way to save money
sw2916A-ms98-a-0037 206.283250 214.901500 and he c[ame]- uh he and his group of course he didn't do it but he got people to do it came up with a a whole book's worth
sw2916A-ms98-a-0038 214.901500 228.861625 of recommendations for making the government run more like a business and he said that you know the the kinds of things the government does even in renting space would drive a business bankrupt
sw2916A-ms98-a-0039 228.861625 238.523500 and uh people purchase things because of the rules that require them to buy certain kinds of things in certain ways
sw2916A-ms98-a-0040 238.523500 250.177625 that are totally irrational they buy more than they need or less than they need or many times as much as they need in little quantities when they ought to be able to um
sw2916A-ms98-a-0041 250.177625 258.284750 you know deal like a business and uh get things in quantity that will uh y[ou]- give them_1 a discount
sw2916A-ms98-a-0042 258.284750 263.204250 they ought to pay their bills on time one thing the government does is is stretch out the payments
sw2916A-ms98-a-0043 263.204250 273.824625 so that they end up paying penalties for things that the government could have paid for the minute it was due and taken the five percent uh credit for early payment
sw2916A-ms98-a-0044 273.824625 285.210750 anyway there was this whole book that came out and i read some excerpts from it and every single thing they recommended was so [laughter-e[minently]-] [laughter-eminently] [laughter-sensible] a[nd]- and
sw2916A-ms98-a-0045 285.210750 290.712625 it just astonishes me that we have not put more of that into practice
sw2916A-ms98-a-0046 290.712625 293.329625 [silence]
sw2916A-ms98-a-0047 293.329625 294.607750 and ev[erytime]-
sw2916A-ms98-a-0048 294.607750 297.141875 [silence]
sw2916A-ms98-a-0049 297.141875 298.982375 right
sw2916A-ms98-a-0050 298.982375 312.345375 and everytime the uh Congress changes and people move offices they redecorate the whole office they spend half a million dollars on the Speaker of the House to renovate an office that had been
sw2916A-ms98-a-0051 312.345375 315.494625 redone less than three years earlier
sw2916A-ms98-a-0052 315.494625 317.085000 [silence]
sw2916A-ms98-a-0053 317.085000 326.738000 and then they come up with these crazy projects to do things like spend seven hundred thousand dollars to make Lawrence Welk's birth place a shrine
sw2916A-ms98-a-0054 326.738000 332.915625 [laughter-i] [laughter-mean] i do not need a national park around Lawrence Welk's birth place
sw2916A-ms98-a-0055 332.915625 338.011000 and i can think of a whole lot better things to do with seven hundred thousand dollars
sw2916A-ms98-a-0056 338.011000 341.592500 [silence]
sw2916A-ms98-a-0057 341.592500 342.512125 [noise]
sw2916A-ms98-a-0058 342.512125 357.286625 well i don't think it does much good but i write my Congressman all the time i've got a congressman who is very concerned about uh uh irrational expenses and who is a real fiscal conservative
sw2916A-ms98-a-0059 357.286625 366.690625 and and so one of the things i do is donate money to his campaigns and uh write to him when i see things that outrage me
sw2916A-ms98-a-0060 366.690625 378.938750 and uh i don't know that it's going to help any but if he got uh if if a lot of Congressmen get that kind of input from their constituents maybe they'll do a little something
sw2916A-ms98-a-0061 378.938750 381.314875 [silence]
sw2916A-ms98-a-0062 381.314875 382.337500 yeah
sw2916A-ms98-a-0063 382.337500 394.501125 [silence]
sw2916A-ms98-a-0064 394.501125 395.687250 yeah
sw2916A-ms98-a-0065 395.687250 399.176250 [silence]
sw2916A-ms98-a-0066 399.176250 408.285875 well i'm in favor of spending money on a strong defense but not of wasting it and some of the things that we do uh like have
sw2916A-ms98-a-0067 408.285875 415.057250 three different kinds of incompatible computer equipment for the three services it's just dumb
sw2916A-ms98-a-0068 415.057250 423.944750 there's no reason why we shouldn't have somebody take a look at uh all of the things that the various services use and make them_1 interchangeable
sw2916A-ms98-a-0069 423.944750 425.157125 [silence]
sw2916A-ms98-a-0070 425.157125 432.027875 then the same spare parts can [laughter-be] [laughter-used] [laughter-in] [laughter] in uh Air Force planes and Navy planes maybe [laughter] 
sw2916A-ms98-a-0071 432.027875 433.118750 [silence]
sw2916A-ms98-a-0072 433.118750 434.861875 oh
sw2916A-ms98-a-0073 434.861875 439.568875 [silence]
sw2916A-ms98-a-0074 439.568875 441.393000 oh yeah
sw2916A-ms98-a-0075 441.393000 449.096875 [silence]
sw2916A-ms98-a-0076 449.096875 450.446500 um-hum
sw2916A-ms98-a-0077 450.446500 456.555875 [silence]
sw2916A-ms98-a-0078 456.555875 457.922125 um
sw2916A-ms98-a-0079 457.922125 460.444875 [silence]
sw2916A-ms98-a-0080 460.444875 467.297375 well that's good but that's that's small comfort because it doesn't bring you any income until you sell it
sw2916A-ms98-a-0081 467.297375 468.532375 [laughter]
sw2916A-ms98-a-0082 468.532375 481.720000 [laughter] now we don't have uh property taxes going up as much as you all do because we had proposition thirteen that says uh once you have had your house appraised then they can only raise the taxes
sw2916A-ms98-a-0083 481.720000 488.995375 i believe it's two percent or maybe it's three percent a year uh until you sell and then it's reevaluated
sw2916A-ms98-a-0084 488.995375 500.159375 uh and that's that helps people on fixed incomes and older people who have houses that have gone up in value a lot but who don't want to move out of them_1
sw2916A-ms98-a-0085 500.159375 508.687750 [silence]
sw2916A-ms98-a-0086 508.687750 513.541750 well the prices are so high i don't see how they can keep going up
sw2916A-ms98-a-0087 513.541750 518.338375 [silence]
sw2916A-ms98-a-0088 518.338375 519.567125 yeah
sw2916A-ms98-a-0089 519.567125 520.834875 [silence]
sw2916A-ms98-a-0090 520.834875 530.089750 well i'm in Silicon Valley and they uh the the reason that the prices have gone up so high is that there just isn't anymore land left to build on most of the
sw2916A-ms98-a-0091 530.089750 540.267250 surrounding land is all uh in preserves of one sort or other and it can't be developed so there's very little property that hasn't already been built on
sw2916A-ms98-a-0092 540.267250 544.831875 and one of the problems our city is having is that uh with
sw2916A-ms98-a-0093 544.831875 555.502500 all of the environmental requirements and the {antidevelopment} people taking over the city council we've driven out some corporations which were paying a lot of our taxes
sw2916A-ms98-a-0094 555.502500 562.882875 and so now they're going to have to assess us because they we've driven out the businesses that were paying the freight
sw2916A-ms98-a-0095 562.882875 572.060750 yeah for instance we have the Stamford Shopping Center which was uh paying oh i think it was about a quarter of our
sw2916A-ms98-a-0096 572.060750 585.556125 uh city budget because of the sales taxes that were collected there and in this recession a lot of those businesses have had poorer receipts and so their sales taxes have dropped and we're about a million dollars below budget
sw2916A-ms98-a-0097 585.556125 599.255000 primarily because of the sales tax drop off and that uh and also Hewlett Packard was uh h[eadquartered]- headquartered here and so everything that they sold the sales taxes uh were pai[d]-
