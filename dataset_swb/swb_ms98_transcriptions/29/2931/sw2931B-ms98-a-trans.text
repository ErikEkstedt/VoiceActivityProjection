sw2931B-ms98-a-0036 242.382000 245.811875 well i can remember my my mom started working
sw2931B-ms98-a-0037 245.811875 251.571750 my parents [vocalized-noise] well course both of them worked but my mom started working when i i was third
sw2931B-ms98-a-0038 251.571750 257.151000 the la[st]- the youngest and she started working when i went to first grade and i can remember
sw2931B-ms98-a-0039 257.151000 264.947375 just a couple of few times that she would stay home and i i don't know if she was sick or just wanted to take the day off or what but
sw2931B-ms98-a-0040 264.947375 274.951875 come home from school and you know eve[ry]- like you'd tell that she'd just mopped and she had you know food was cooking and the house smelled so good
sw2931B-ms98-a-0041 274.951875 283.944375 uh i tell you what i'd ta[ke]- i don't know if children who maybe children who have that everyday don't don't don't appreciate it as much as you know
sw2931B-ms98-a-0042 283.944375 291.994375 but uh it really was really was a special and i wished that she could have been home more it would have been greater because she was
sw2931B-ms98-a-0043 291.994375 296.876875 because she worked she was always kind of high strung and you know
sw2931B-ms98-a-0044 296.876875 300.467875 didn't have the time to spend with us individually so
sw2931B-ms98-a-0045 300.467875 307.399125 i think it's great if if uh if if you enjoy staying home with your kids while they're young and and can do it
sw2931B-ms98-a-0046 307.399125 312.809625 that's great i wish i could stay home now [laughter]
