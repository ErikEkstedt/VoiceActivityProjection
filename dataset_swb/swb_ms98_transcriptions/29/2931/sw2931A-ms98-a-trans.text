sw2931A-ms98-a-0017 66.941250 75.357250 yeah well i first of all i'd i admire you for i have a few friends who are single parents and i just don't know how people [laughter-do] [laughter-it] [laughter]
sw2931A-ms98-a-0018 75.357250 80.447125 that's is a tremendous burden to be working and have two kids to take care of
sw2931A-ms98-a-0019 80.447125 88.575500 and i don't know how you did it but um i have a six year old that's well she's in first grade and then i have a three and a half year old and um
sw2931A-ms98-a-0020 88.575500 93.170000 i have always been a big advocate of spending tons of time with my kids
sw2931A-ms98-a-0021 93.170000 99.998500 and um when i my first one when she was born i had to work part-time for a while because we had to have the extra money
sw2931A-ms98-a-0022 99.998500 106.959750 but when the second one came along i was fortunate enough that i i quit and i've been able to stay home and um
sw2931A-ms98-a-0023 106.959750 113.509000 no no i don't work yeah and so i'm one of those few old-fashioned moms [laughter] and we
sw2931A-ms98-a-0024 113.509000 122.998625 uh i spend the whole day with Tara and we go and do things and we read books and we play and you know it's just it's great and i did the same thing with Taylor
sw2931A-ms98-a-0025 122.998625 131.563375 uh who's my first grader she's also a girl and uh i th[ink]- i think i can tell a real difference um Taylor has excelled in school like i just
sw2931A-ms98-a-0026 131.563375 138.817750 i never imagined she would she's at the top of her class in everything even though she's almost two year younger than almost all the kids in her class
sw2931A-ms98-a-0027 138.817750 144.245250 and i really feel like that um time i spent with her i mean she probably already had a lot uh
sw2931A-ms98-a-0028 144.245250 152.690500 of it in her but you know we spent a whole lot of time together reading books and doing a lot of things i think it helped her to feel real good about herself and
sw2931A-ms98-a-0029 152.690500 155.967875 feel like she could she could do it you know [laughter]
sw2931A-ms98-a-0030 155.967875 159.674250 so it's it's been real rewarding for me anyway
sw2931A-ms98-a-0031 159.674250 172.940000 [silence]
sw2931A-ms98-a-0032 172.940000 174.831375 oh i'm sure

sw2931A-ms98-a-0047 200.785875 210.912250 well it is you know as a matter of fact i think i'm real bad about looking ahead and thinking oh i don't ever want them to [laughter] grow up and you know go away to college and all that kind of thing
sw2931A-ms98-a-0048 210.912250 219.335250 but at least i'm really making the most of the time while they're little and um everything Taylor even attempts to do you know we go and watch her and
sw2931A-ms98-a-0049 219.335250 231.026875 and support her and that was something my parents weren't able to do and i resented that because i would be in i was always in plays in high school and in all kinds of drama and they could never come and watch me and that just
sw2931A-ms98-a-0050 231.026875 237.411750 it was so hard for me so i made a vow that when i had kids no matter what they did i was going to be there you know
sw2931A-ms98-a-0051 237.411750 242.799625 and see them do it so it and like you said it's fun i really enjoy it

sw2931A-ms98-a-0075 307.922375 309.201750 [silence]
sw2931A-ms98-a-0076 309.201750 322.589250 yeah [laughter-i] [laughter-know] [laughter-well] i feel i feel really thankful that i can i mean we have had to really lower our standard of living you know we have friends who have beautiful homes and we have a very small old house
sw2931A-ms98-a-0077 322.589250 332.766625 but i just to me that's not important because i feel like we'll have plenty of time to get us a nice house some day [laughter] and i won't have these you know these little kids all my life so
sw2931A-ms98-a-0078 332.766625 339.334750 um i just i have been willing to make the sacrifices and my husband has too and so it's not been a problem for us
sw2931A-ms98-a-0079 339.334750 342.990500 [silence]
sw2931A-ms98-a-0080 342.990500 344.535500 right
sw2931A-ms98-a-0081 344.535500 354.002625 [silence]
sw2931A-ms98-a-0082 354.002625 360.069375 well it's interesting we're real involved with a church group and so most of our friends are uh church friends
sw2931A-ms98-a-0083 360.069375 367.513250 and they're the majority of them do stay home uh almost all of my friends i can call any time of day and they're home
sw2931A-ms98-a-0084 367.513250 377.176375 but um the fr[iends]- the friends that i've kept in contact with from you know when i did work and they're still working moms you know uh that
sw2931A-ms98-a-0085 377.176375 388.514375 i feel like i real big uh difference in opinion with some of them because some of them work just because they enjoy working you know they they don't really have to work they just want to they like to get out and
sw2931A-ms98-a-0086 388.514375 396.202500 they don't want to be with their kids all day [laughter] and and that's hard for me because to me they're giving up something so precious you know and um
sw2931A-ms98-a-0087 396.202500 402.219625 so any time we talk get on that topic i have to be real careful because i'm afraid i'll say something to offend them [laughter]
sw2931A-ms98-a-0088 402.219625 408.287375 but um most of my friends do stay home so that it's kind of nice we we have a big support group around here
sw2931A-ms98-a-0089 408.287375 415.325500 yeah it is i don't know how long everybody will be able to afford to keep doing it [laughter] but if
sw2931A-ms98-a-0090 415.325500 419.673500 i guess you just get used to you know living however you have to live to
sw2931A-ms98-a-0091 419.673500 424.494875 [silence]
sw2931A-ms98-a-0092 424.494875 425.872500 yeah
sw2931A-ms98-a-0093 425.872500 428.731625 [silence]
sw2931A-ms98-a-0094 428.731625 430.943125 right yeah
sw2931A-ms98-a-0095 430.943125 443.395625 yeah well i intend to uh i think when they're both in school i may i have a degree to teach and um i've never used it because i was pregnant when i graduated from college and i've always had you know been home with kids or worked part-time
sw2931A-ms98-a-0096 443.395625 448.805375 but um i might go into like substitute teaching or something because
sw2931A-ms98-a-0097 448.805375 449.853375 [silence]
sw2931A-ms98-a-0098 449.853375 458.800125 yeah yeah and i can choose they say as a substitute you can tell them the days that you're interested and you know the days you're not you don't have to so
sw2931A-ms98-a-0099 458.800125 463.852875 [silence]
sw2931A-ms98-a-0100 463.852875 471.783875 right yeah because i have a feeling i'm not going to like [laughter-it] [laughter] when i did my uh student teaching i oh i hated it
sw2931A-ms98-a-0101 471.783875 478.866750 i said i don't know why i majored in uh elementary education and here i'm about to graduate and i don't even like this [laughter]
sw2931A-ms98-a-0102 478.866750 481.304500 [silence]

sw2931A-ms98-a-0107 487.168250 492.935125 yeah it'll probably make a whole difference and plus i didn't feel well at the time i was pregnant and i was real sick and
sw2931A-ms98-a-0108 492.935125 499.263000 yeah i and you just don't feel like being around all these little kids when you are just sick to your [laughter-stomach]
sw2931A-ms98-a-0109 499.263000 502.086000 but anyway it's been nice talking to you
