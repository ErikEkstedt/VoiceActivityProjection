sw2919A-ms98-a-0002 1.006625 3.405000 have you had any thoughts on this
sw2919A-ms98-a-0003 3.405000 11.600250 [silence]
sw2919A-ms98-a-0004 11.600250 13.238125 um-hum
sw2919A-ms98-a-0005 13.238125 16.107500 how old are you if i can ask [laughter]
sw2919A-ms98-a-0006 16.107500 17.636250 how old are you
sw2919A-ms98-a-0007 17.636250 18.891625 [silence]
sw2919A-ms98-a-0008 18.891625 21.138125 okay so we're about the same age
sw2919A-ms98-a-0009 21.138125 25.598000 [silence]
sw2919A-ms98-a-0010 25.598000 26.846250 um-hum
sw2919A-ms98-a-0011 26.846250 33.647250 [silence]
sw2919A-ms98-a-0012 33.647250 34.913750 um-hum
sw2919A-ms98-a-0013 34.913750 38.583250 [silence]
sw2919A-ms98-a-0014 38.583250 47.671375 yeah i think this is also a a broader scope i think uh they're talking about uh just service in general and um
sw2919A-ms98-a-0015 47.671375 61.674500 i i did a lot of this sort of thing in in college in the summers um i worked uh in uh Mexico doing community service f[or]- uh for two summers while i was in college and you know it was an incredibly worthwhile experience
sw2919A-ms98-a-0016 61.674500 68.093250 so in theory i'm am favor of this but on the other hand i'm an economist [laughter]
sw2919A-ms98-a-0017 68.093250 78.368000 and uh just like uh well the military has a tremendous uh you know responsibility for security and everything but there's also an equally tremendous budget
sw2919A-ms98-a-0018 78.368000 83.868625 so i guess on the other hand as a[s]- as as good as this idea is it's got to be paid for
sw2919A-ms98-a-0019 83.868625 94.048625 uh even though it's uh you know it it's it's never quite voluntary people have to be paid if they're asked to serve for a year in any capacity
sw2919A-ms98-a-0020 94.048625 98.958250 so uh you know uh uh the idea's great where does the money come [laughter-from]
sw2919A-ms98-a-0021 98.958250 100.174500 an[d]-
sw2919A-ms98-a-0022 100.174500 113.715750 [silence]
sw2919A-ms98-a-0023 113.715750 114.978250 um-hum
sw2919A-ms98-a-0024 114.978250 119.567500 [silence]
sw2919A-ms98-a-0025 119.567500 124.178375 it should i[t]- it should or shouldn't it should um-hum
sw2919A-ms98-a-0026 124.178375 126.380000 [silence]
sw2919A-ms98-a-0027 126.380000 133.225250 but i don't think it w[as]- it was voluntary i think it was just the re[quired]- year of required service there was nothing about voluntary
sw2919A-ms98-a-0028 133.225250 137.601625 that's why as an economist my my [laughter-my] ears perked up
sw2919A-ms98-a-0029 137.601625 148.857750 [silence]
sw2919A-ms98-a-0030 148.857750 150.214250 um-hum
sw2919A-ms98-a-0031 150.214250 154.215375 [silence]
sw2919A-ms98-a-0032 154.215375 155.607375 uh-huh
sw2919A-ms98-a-0033 155.607375 156.783250 [silence]
sw2919A-ms98-a-0034 156.783250 160.254500 and doing it at a less expensive rate then
sw2919A-ms98-a-0035 160.254500 162.042250 uh-huh
sw2919A-ms98-a-0036 162.042250 164.435875 [silence]
sw2919A-ms98-a-0037 164.435875 168.306375 of course you'll probably get another whole layer of bureaucracy running it
sw2919A-ms98-a-0038 168.306375 173.411625 i mean let's face it the military is probably [laughter-one] [laughter-of] [laughter-the] [laughter-most] [laughter-bureaucratic] [laughter-agencies]
sw2919A-ms98-a-0039 173.411625 181.569375 so i- i- i you know on the one hand my immediate reaction to it was oh it's wonderful you know i think people do owe their country something whether it
sw2919A-ms98-a-0040 181.569375 188.503625 they serve in the military or for those who f[or]- for one reason or other can't want to serve in another area and have talents in another ar[ea]-
sw2919A-ms98-a-0041 188.503625 196.276000 great but then who pays and if they have to and they don't go into the lab[or]- the other labor force you're losing money in terms of taxing
sw2919A-ms98-a-0042 196.276000 201.432625 from other jobs i mean so there's it's not it's not a real cut and dry
sw2919A-ms98-a-0043 201.432625 202.883750 thing
sw2919A-ms98-a-0044 202.883750 209.158125 [silence]
sw2919A-ms98-a-0045 209.158125 210.502125 um-hum

sw2919A-ms98-a-0051 222.228875 224.841125 and just marching around waiting for a [laughter-war]
sw2919A-ms98-a-0052 224.841125 235.757125 yeah uh we did have something similar to a volunteer thing with uh which was vo[lunteer]- although volunteer there was a minimum payment uh like Vista which was a domestic Peace Corps some time back
sw2919A-ms98-a-0053 235.757125 240.095000 and probably coming from Texas you may have bumped into some of that
sw2919A-ms98-a-0054 240.095000 241.135250 [silence]
sw2919A-ms98-a-0055 241.135250 242.615250 oh
sw2919A-ms98-a-0056 242.615250 244.444625 [silence]
sw2919A-ms98-a-0057 244.444625 248.676875 yeah and i know the ar[my]- what's the army has a corps of engineers
sw2919A-ms98-a-0058 248.676875 260.368500 which uh could probably be one of those areas that uh could be uh privatized or civilianized or whatever some of the areas there you know for domestic use
sw2919A-ms98-a-0059 260.368500 267.196500 i've always wondered why the army corps o[f]- of engineers took care of floods [laughter-you] [laughter-know] in in [laughter-certain] areas why was
sw2919A-ms98-a-0060 267.196500 272.602000 [silence]

sw2919A-ms98-a-0063 277.634750 278.866500 um-hum
sw2919A-ms98-a-0064 278.866500 282.706625 but of course there are many private engineering schools that are absolutely superb
sw2919A-ms98-a-0065 282.706625 286.795750 [silence]
sw2919A-ms98-a-0066 286.795750 288.449000 yeah they made
sw2919A-ms98-a-0067 288.449000 289.456125 [silence]
sw2919A-ms98-a-0068 289.456125 290.695875 um-hum
sw2919A-ms98-a-0069 290.695875 291.707750 [silence]
sw2919A-ms98-a-0070 291.707750 300.502000 yeah and of course back during the depression when the government started doing things like uh CCC the Civilian Conservation Corps
sw2919A-ms98-a-0071 300.502000 312.067000 so i uh you know there's a bit of a history of people serving the government and it doesn't have to be as the military you know if you go in just as a as an enlistee uh the wage isn't anything great
sw2919A-ms98-a-0072 312.067000 318.376000 so if if you're asking for a year of service it doesn't have to be a wage comparable to the uh
sw2919A-ms98-a-0073 318.376000 328.889750 if it's a required year it doesn't have to be a wage comparable to the private sector so it could be you know a wage enough to for have someone to live on to eat and if uh if in fact
sw2919A-ms98-a-0074 328.889750 333.287625 so i guess that it a lot of thinking would have to be done if it were implemented [noise]

sw2919A-ms98-a-0078 345.552875 354.115125 how it's administered and how you know uh just the who uh who who would be exempted because i'm sure there would be exemptions to it
sw2919A-ms98-a-0079 354.115125 355.441750 uh

sw2919A-ms98-a-0083 369.918250 375.357000 um-hum or even [noise] or even [noise] doing paperwork for a police systems you know

sw2919A-ms98-a-0085 378.779750 380.983375 um-hum yeah
sw2919A-ms98-a-0086 380.983375 383.053500 homeless homeless and all 
sw2919A-ms98-a-0087 383.053500 384.861125 i think they're going to cut us off
sw2919A-ms98-a-0088 384.861125 386.199500 [silence]
sw2919A-ms98-a-0089 386.199500 388.159000 oh oh
sw2919A-ms98-a-0090 388.159000 398.746750 yeah but i think you know in terms of the the the cri[me]- pressing problems in the United States today that in terms of the homeless in terms of the state of the the state of the prisons
sw2919A-ms98-a-0091 398.746750 408.292875 um there're there're probably a lot of things that could be done uh on a volunteer basis so maybe they should do pilot projects to try it out to see how it works

sw2919A-ms98-a-0093 409.298125 411.550375 yeah well listen it was good talking with you
