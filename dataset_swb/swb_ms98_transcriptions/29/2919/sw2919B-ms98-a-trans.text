sw2919B-ms98-a-0019 98.191000 112.055250 right i guess uh uh i've ha[d]- i have had some thoughts in the past that uh this this service should not be uh performed for for areas that we don't need the service you know uh it's if it's uh
sw2919B-ms98-a-0020 112.055250 119.978000 if it's voluntary service but it's being furnished by the government it should be to take the place of things that the government's doing already

sw2919B-ms98-a-0030 142.775375 154.471500 if we're going to replace if we're going to to institute this national service policy that that service policy should replace some other area
sw2919B-ms98-a-0031 154.471500 165.390500 where we're spending money uh you know uh you know el[iminate]- eliminate some bureaucrats [laughter] [laughter-and] let the let these na[tional]- this national service take care of their job

sw2919B-ms98-a-0046 209.874250 222.863125 have the the military which is you know i[s]- i[s]- is a a a real drain financially on the country have the people that are in the military serve some other function you know i[nstead]- instead of just military uh

sw2919B-ms98-a-0058 264.350000 273.382625 [laughter-right] it's well i guess uh i[n]- in in looking at that one reason that the army corps of engineers is that uh the military schools
sw2919B-ms98-a-0059 273.382625 280.305250 do have probably among the top engineering schools in the country uh

sw2919B-ms98-a-0072 333.490500 339.463375 yeah uh yeah i guess uh basically i'm you know i'm in favor of uh of the idea but
sw2919B-ms98-a-0073 339.463375 348.225125 i think that uh like you said a lot of thought needs to go into it just uh the financing and and the the uh the yeah
