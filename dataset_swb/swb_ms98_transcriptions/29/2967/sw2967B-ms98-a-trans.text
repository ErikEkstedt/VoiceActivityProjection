sw2967B-ms98-a-0002 2.041250 14.060875 uh well i have uh seen Dances With Wolves which is probably the the best movie that i have seen lately uh i do not go out to films very often
sw2967B-ms98-a-0003 14.060875 23.414750 so as far as out of the house so we do get a lot of videos that we bring in uh and i see some that way but uh i am not real current on films how about you

sw2967B-ms98-a-0018 58.790500 62.316375 oh and he hears them or something and
sw2967B-ms98-a-0019 62.316375 64.523250 [silence]
sw2967B-ms98-a-0020 64.523250 67.358750 [laughter] who wins
sw2967B-ms98-a-0021 67.358750 73.029750 oh great great yeah i had heard people talk about it and they say it was really cute but i hadn't seen it
sw2967B-ms98-a-0022 73.029750 78.273625 uh we usually wait and ev[entually]- eventually it comes out on video and then we get it and see it that way
sw2967B-ms98-a-0023 78.273625 87.718125 and that is it movies are very expensive uh movie theatres here they are six dollars uh for evening performances and that is kind of steep
sw2967B-ms98-a-0024 87.718125 90.398250 i think i don't know how much is it in Dallas
sw2967B-ms98-a-0025 90.398250 95.280000 [silence]
sw2967B-ms98-a-0026 95.280000 99.760375 yeah you can do that but it is difficult if you if you work or you know
sw2967B-ms98-a-0027 99.760375 107.544625 uh that is taking the middle of the afternoon and if i am looking for entertainment usually i i have more uh time in the evening than i do in the middle of the day
sw2967B-ms98-a-0028 107.544625 113.285250 to uh see things what do you think of movies in general as far as the as the trends
sw2967B-ms98-a-0029 113.285250 123.985625 [silence]
sw2967B-ms98-a-0030 123.985625 125.214250 uh-huh
sw2967B-ms98-a-0031 125.214250 126.992125 [silence]
sw2967B-ms98-a-0032 126.992125 128.946875 yeah did
sw2967B-ms98-a-0033 128.946875 139.531375 yeah the quality i think maybe has improved in that respect uh the only thing that disturbs me is that now they think they have to add just a little bit of sex and violence in order to get a
sw2967B-ms98-a-0034 139.531375 150.187500 a tougher rating which suggests that that you know it will be more enticing to the to the public and a lot of times it is added for no real uh valid reason
sw2967B-ms98-a-0035 150.187500 154.677000 uh which does not make and i think Smokey and the Bandit was a little bit like that
sw2967B-ms98-a-0036 154.677000 165.545125 uh but Dances With Wolves did not seem to have anything added it was just all legitimate kind of uh film and that is where reason why i suppose it won so many Oscars uh
sw2967B-ms98-a-0037 165.545125 175.889750 because it really was good even though it is such a long movie you know they said oh people won't won't be interested in a three hour movie but it certainly gotten good acclaim everywhere it has gone
sw2967B-ms98-a-0038 175.889750 178.018750 [silence]
sw2967B-ms98-a-0039 178.018750 184.827500 oh oh yeah absolutely uh but much more true to life and i think that is that is the point
sw2967B-ms98-a-0040 184.827500 193.178125 uh they do not have to keep making up stuff if they want to make something good i hate sequels too i hate these uh you know number one two three four
sw2967B-ms98-a-0041 193.178125 196.738750 usually if a movie is good once is enough [laughter]
sw2967B-ms98-a-0042 196.738750 198.761250 [laughter] right [laughter] 
sw2967B-ms98-a-0043 198.761250 213.390500 that was on Prime Time Television here uh recently at seven thirty in the evening and uh it was kind of shocking because that is a scary movie and children young children could see could have seen that movie
sw2967B-ms98-a-0044 213.390500 226.058875 uh at that hour and i thought that you know that would not have been the sort of thing i would have wanted my children to see at that age uh i mean when they were young and here it was quite easily seen by anybody that turned on the TV
sw2967B-ms98-a-0045 226.058875 233.040750 uh which was a it was a good movie i mean it was well done but uh that is one reason why it was scary
sw2967B-ms98-a-0046 233.040750 236.981375 so but i do not know that i have seen any of the uh sequels to that
sw2967B-ms98-a-0047 236.981375 239.021750 i think one is enough
sw2967B-ms98-a-0048 239.021750 241.762375 [silence]
sw2967B-ms98-a-0049 241.762375 244.238625 yes uh-huh that is what people say
sw2967B-ms98-a-0050 244.238625 250.937000 [silence]
sw2967B-ms98-a-0051 250.937000 252.307250 oh

sw2967B-ms98-a-0053 253.414125 255.897125 yeah it just a touch [laughter]
sw2967B-ms98-a-0054 255.897125 258.213625 well the whole movie is kind of far fetched
sw2967B-ms98-a-0055 258.213625 262.096250 but i mean the whole idea behind it is far fetched
sw2967B-ms98-a-0056 262.096250 263.986500 [silence]
sw2967B-ms98-a-0057 263.986500 267.290125 not not too often [laughter]
sw2967B-ms98-a-0058 267.290125 273.913500 [laughter] that has gotten to be a whole camp i[dea]- idea now though you know if you hear that music you know everybody knows what you are talking about 
sw2967B-ms98-a-0059 273.913500 275.413625 it's funny
sw2967B-ms98-a-0060 275.413625 277.076625 [silence]
sw2967B-ms98-a-0061 277.076625 279.999875 well it sounds like neither one of us are real movie buffs
sw2967B-ms98-a-0062 279.999875 285.520000 [silence]
sw2967B-ms98-a-0063 285.520000 286.741500 yeah

sw2967B-ms98-a-0067 298.036625 300.989500 right yeah i saw it then too
sw2967B-ms98-a-0068 300.989500 305.227250 yeah it was good it was very good but uh um uh
sw2967B-ms98-a-0069 305.227250 318.679500 see i have uh teenagers in my house and of course sometimes they rent movies and you know have friends over or something and sometimes movies are here that i did not i am not even aware that i could have seen you know because my family tells me that that that it had been actually in the house [laughter-before]
sw2967B-ms98-a-0070 318.679500 322.598750 but i'd missed it but i did see it on TV and i thought it was good
sw2967B-ms98-a-0071 322.598750 338.021250 [silence]
sw2967B-ms98-a-0072 338.021250 340.019750 oh really
sw2967B-ms98-a-0073 340.019750 340.973375 [silence]
sw2967B-ms98-a-0074 340.973375 342.614625 uh-huh
sw2967B-ms98-a-0075 342.614625 343.464500 [silence]
sw2967B-ms98-a-0076 343.464500 345.791250 no kidding oh i did not realize that
sw2967B-ms98-a-0077 345.791250 351.421625 yeah uh you know the character that uh James Earle Jones played
sw2967B-ms98-a-0078 351.421625 358.358000 uh uh i teach in school and we are doing a book called Invisible Man by Ralph Ellison
sw2967B-ms98-a-0079 358.358000 361.864125 and i wondered if maybe he was patterned after him
sw2967B-ms98-a-0080 361.864125 366.962500 uh i do not know i had not heard anybody talk about it but uh he certainly could have been
sw2967B-ms98-a-0081 366.962500 368.853750 uh which was kind of interesting
sw2967B-ms98-a-0082 368.853750 375.641125 you know someone who uh who was a real activist but then took up the cause uh kind of gave up you know because he didn't think anything was happening and
sw2967B-ms98-a-0083 375.641125 378.120750 so uh it was kind of fun
sw2967B-ms98-a-0084 378.120750 379.429250 [silence]
sw2967B-ms98-a-0085 379.429250 388.373875 i do not know for sure but there are certain uh qualities that suggest it could be he because they were uh
sw2967B-ms98-a-0086 388.373875 400.518000 they were suggesting that this Ben was something of a recluse that he had stopped writing and had stopped you know and that is true for Ellison he he wrote that one book and a few essays and that is about it
sw2967B-ms98-a-0087 400.518000 403.793250 and uh has pretty much dropped out of public life
sw2967B-ms98-a-0088 403.793250 404.918375 [silence]
sw2967B-ms98-a-0089 404.918375 408.211875 but he is still alive and that you know that's what makes it so interesting
sw2967B-ms98-a-0090 408.211875 410.126875 and that book have you ever read that book
sw2967B-ms98-a-0091 410.126875 412.010000 Invisible Man
sw2967B-ms98-a-0092 412.010000 414.175125 Invisible Man by Ralph Ellison
sw2967B-ms98-a-0093 414.175125 416.607375 it is an incredible book
sw2967B-ms98-a-0094 416.607375 420.816750 it uh really is very very interesting i highly recommend it
sw2967B-ms98-a-0095 420.816750 422.363000 [silence]
sw2967B-ms98-a-0096 422.363000 429.438375 uh the yeah the movie the in Field Field of Dreams came out after uh that novel
sw2967B-ms98-a-0097 429.438375 441.433625 so i[t]- it could easily have been patterned after him but the the movie did not have anything to do with with the story that i am talking about but i just thought the act[or]- the uh author could have been patterned after that uh
sw2967B-ms98-a-0098 441.433625 446.392875 i mean th[at]- that character could have been patterned after him or someone like him certainly
sw2967B-ms98-a-0099 446.392875 448.027375 [silence]
sw2967B-ms98-a-0100 448.027375 450.456250 sort of interesting so
sw2967B-ms98-a-0101 450.456250 454.176000 well i guess we have talked probably our l[imit]- time limit haven't we
sw2967B-ms98-a-0102 454.176000 457.389125 okay very good it was nice talking to you
sw2967B-ms98-a-0103 457.389125 458.772500 okay bye-bye
