sw2994B-ms98-a-0022 99.913250 103.139500 yeah worth bothering to go in and do
sw2994B-ms98-a-0023 103.139500 106.597000 do you um have any ideas on anything that would make
sw2994B-ms98-a-0024 106.597000 112.767000 [silence]
sw2994B-ms98-a-0025 112.767000 114.287250 uh-huh
sw2994B-ms98-a-0026 114.287250 131.783125 [silence]

sw2994B-ms98-a-0028 133.532125 139.817625 [silence]
sw2994B-ms98-a-0029 139.817625 142.027125 yeah that'd be a good idea
sw2994B-ms98-a-0030 142.027125 143.368250 yeah
sw2994B-ms98-a-0031 143.368250 146.590125 [silence]
sw2994B-ms98-a-0032 146.590125 148.088750 right
sw2994B-ms98-a-0033 148.088750 152.290375 yeah that would be a real good motivation for people
sw2994B-ms98-a-0034 152.290375 162.778375 [silence]
sw2994B-ms98-a-0035 162.778375 164.546375 right
sw2994B-ms98-a-0036 164.546375 168.912375 yeah my father was telling me about some program he read about where you buy your bags
sw2994B-ms98-a-0037 168.912375 181.100500 [noise] like you buy your garbage bag from the city and you pay more than just what you would pay for an empty garbage bag but then you don't pay any monthly fee or anything so however many bags of garbage you throw away that's how many you have to pay for
sw2994B-ms98-a-0038 181.100500 182.326250 [silence]
sw2994B-ms98-a-0039 182.326250 184.074250 yeah
sw2994B-ms98-a-0040 184.074250 186.781625 yeah that would be a real good idea
sw2994B-ms98-a-0041 186.781625 188.109875 [silence]
sw2994B-ms98-a-0042 188.109875 197.721000 i'm trying to think if there's anything else i could think of they're talking about going to curbside pickup in our in our city [vocalized-noise] Rowlett Texas do you know do you where that is 
sw2994B-ms98-a-0043 197.721000 198.740375 [silence]
sw2994B-ms98-a-0044 198.740375 206.518250 and i don't know if they decided to do or not but i think they said it was gonna add like either a dollar or three dollars a month to your bill
sw2994B-ms98-a-0045 206.518250 211.811500 to have them do that although i think a lot of those programs can operate at about a break even
sw2994B-ms98-a-0046 211.811500 216.483500 break even point without charging people yeah
sw2994B-ms98-a-0047 216.483500 218.374250 [silence]
sw2994B-ms98-a-0048 218.374250 220.532125 i don't know um
sw2994B-ms98-a-0049 220.532125 230.727375 i guess it just depends on how they [laughter-manage] [laughter-it] i don't know how much they get when they sell all that stuff the center that their got now where you take your stuff in i th[ink]- i think that should be making some money
sw2994B-ms98-a-0050 230.727375 234.452500 since they just have to hire someone to man it a few hours a week
sw2994B-ms98-a-0051 234.452500 235.964625 [silence]
sw2994B-ms98-a-0052 235.964625 240.708000 and they sell i guess they sell everything to some waste company that comes and gets it
sw2994B-ms98-a-0053 240.708000 242.506125 [silence]
sw2994B-ms98-a-0054 242.506125 245.154250 but i wish that uh
sw2994B-ms98-a-0055 245.154250 255.135125 uh more of the cans you know like the cans you buy vegetables and fruit and stuff like that in were recyclable i don't a lot of that's that recyclable steel and i don't know anybody that takes that
sw2994B-ms98-a-0056 255.135125 265.544375 th[e]- my husband likes Pepsi and those cans are steel instead of aluminum so we can't can't ever recycle those i think it's a good reason to quit buying it
sw2994B-ms98-a-0057 265.544375 269.728500 [silence]
sw2994B-ms98-a-0058 269.728500 276.267000 yeah that's what we buy the most of unless we're going on a trip or something where we want to put the cans in a cooler
sw2994B-ms98-a-0059 276.267000 278.050250 but [noise]
sw2994B-ms98-a-0060 278.050250 283.503375 well that's all i can really think about [laughter] for recycling it was good talking to you um bye
sw2994B-ms98-a-0061 283.503375 290.134750 [noise]
