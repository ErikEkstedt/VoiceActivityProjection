sw2901A-ms98-a-0085 341.776000 345.126750 and they became HUDD foreclosures
sw2901A-ms98-a-0086 345.126750 351.067000 and people are picking those up for very little so maybe you could luck into something like that and get a real nice house that way

sw2901A-ms98-a-0091 365.800000 368.633125 uh and it's just a lot of upkeep
sw2901A-ms98-a-0092 368.633125 374.623500 and you spend a lot of time with them and then and there is there is uh quite a bit of cost involved

sw2901A-ms98-a-0094 379.677125 389.826000 chemicals water it it it and if you have it i had mine heated so the elec[tricity]- electricity well not the electricity but the gas and electricity because_1 you do have both

sw2901A-ms98-a-0104 459.619125 467.313250 well i mean i[t]- i[t]- i[t]- it especially in this neighborhood you know of course you can tell there there there's about three different major jumps
sw2901A-ms98-a-0105 467.313250 472.599000 they start here they start at about one fifty and go up to about five hundred
sw2901A-ms98-a-0106 472.599000 480.520500 and you can you can s[ee]- and and you may have one next to you that's four hundred and the other one you know down the other street will be you know one fifty

sw2901A-ms98-a-0109 484.013375 493.043250 well actually they're they're pretty much just just spaced here and there which makes it nice because you get to apprec[iate]- you get to share some of the appreciation of everybody else's property value
sw2901A-ms98-a-0110 493.043250 503.055250 and uh like the guy just next door to us he's probably got the same square footage but he paid anoth[er]- hu[ndred]- he paid about a hundred thousand more than we did
sw2901A-ms98-a-0111 503.055250 507.697250 but you ought to see his pool he paid forty five thousand dollars just for his pool
sw2901A-ms98-a-0112 507.697250 511.271375 and it's got little fountains and all kinds of stuff
sw2901A-ms98-a-0113 511.271375 525.373250 and of course i spent all my [laughter-mo[ney]-] i spent most of the m[oney]- the extra money that we had i spent it in you know we put curtains and all this stuff in and then we put uh the the landscaping did the landscaping so that there's minimal you know upkeep in the yard
sw2901A-ms98-a-0114 525.373250 528.122250 because_1 i travel a lot and i and i don't have time
sw2901A-ms98-a-0115 528.122250 530.024250 [silence]
sw2901A-ms98-a-0116 530.024250 533.869625 and uh and i you know have some deck in the back
sw2901A-ms98-a-0117 533.869625 541.967375 and uh you know we have like a it's not like a it's not really a gazebo but it's kind of like a little area out there where the where we have some you know table and chairs and stuff like that
sw2901A-ms98-a-0118 541.967375 551.412500 and there's just very little to mow very little upkeep you have to pull weeds out of the flower beds occasionally uh but uh what i des[igned]- sorry
sw2901A-ms98-a-0119 551.412500 554.410375 no i was going to say when i designed this house i designed it myself
sw2901A-ms98-a-0120 554.410375 569.293500 and i took a lot of time to plan out everything i like like wha[t]- you know where my stereo where the TV so i have built in cabinets and uh you know big covered patio big game room big living area big dining room
sw2901A-ms98-a-0121 569.293500 574.639750 uh bedroom the closets you can [vocalized-noise] my wife's master closet
sw2901A-ms98-a-0122 574.639750 578.518125 is probably the size of a small bedroom
sw2901A-ms98-a-0123 578.518125 583.547250 [silence]
sw2901A-ms98-a-0124 583.547250 593.401125 and lots and lots of shelves built in uh chest of drawers and stuff in the closets so it it's really it it we designed it to stay here for a while
sw2901A-ms98-a-0125 593.401125 599.338750 [silence]
