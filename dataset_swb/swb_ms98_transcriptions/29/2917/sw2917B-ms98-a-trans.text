sw2917B-ms98-a-0002 2.730250 11.819500 oh [laughter] well my husband and i have gotten into some some problems with credit cards we don't handle them very well
sw2917B-ms98-a-0003 11.819500 16.686875 we we tend to run them up to the maximum and then ask for more [laughter]
sw2917B-ms98-a-0004 16.686875 25.375750 they they're they're really bad for us um matter of fact we've gotten rid of all of our credit cards except for a MasterCard and a Visa
sw2917B-ms98-a-0005 25.375750 28.676625 then and we pretty much keep those {maxed} out
sw2917B-ms98-a-0006 28.676625 34.706625 [silence]
sw2917B-ms98-a-0007 34.706625 39.810000 yeah we had cre[dit]- i had probably twenty credit cards
sw2917B-ms98-a-0008 39.810000 50.434500 um for i had i had an American Express American Express Gold an Optima all the different department stores um
sw2917B-ms98-a-0009 50.434500 54.015625 two Visas two MasterCards [laughter]
sw2917B-ms98-a-0010 54.015625 57.771250 i mean i had any time anybody would
sw2917B-ms98-a-0011 57.771250 66.741500 you know send me an application you know preapproved or whatever i went i took it and it really ended up getting us in some real serious trouble
sw2917B-ms98-a-0012 66.741500 68.040125 um
sw2917B-ms98-a-0013 68.040125 73.807125 because see the more the more credit cards you have the more people offer them to you
sw2917B-ms98-a-0014 73.807125 77.931250 um and the more you use them the more the more they send them to you
sw2917B-ms98-a-0015 77.931250 80.387250 [silence]
sw2917B-ms98-a-0016 80.387250 84.732000 exactly and the American Express was probably the wo[rst]- the worst
sw2917B-ms98-a-0017 84.732000 92.179250 um because the with the Gold card i can't remember how much it was because i didn't even have it very long before i gave it up
sw2917B-ms98-a-0018 92.179250 97.196750 but i know the Green card was like thirty five forty five dollars a year
sw2917B-ms98-a-0019 97.196750 98.442250 [silence]
sw2917B-ms98-a-0020 98.442250 99.504375 um
sw2917B-ms98-a-0021 99.504375 100.885375 [silence]
sw2917B-ms98-a-0022 100.885375 105.147625 which was a lot because i mean you had to pay it in full every month
sw2917B-ms98-a-0023 105.147625 114.009500 [silence]
sw2917B-ms98-a-0024 114.009500 115.133125 uh-huh
sw2917B-ms98-a-0025 115.133125 132.228125 [silence]
sw2917B-ms98-a-0026 132.228125 140.335000 um-hum yeah i had a Discover and that was one of the ones in the group that i ended up um closing
sw2917B-ms98-a-0027 140.335000 141.823500 [silence]
sw2917B-ms98-a-0028 141.823500 143.253375 um
sw2917B-ms98-a-0029 143.253375 153.199875 it really wasn't my choice though i mean i ended up having i ended up actually losing my credit cards um i ended up going through a credit counseling service
sw2917B-ms98-a-0030 153.199875 157.621500 um because my husband and i just don't handle credit very well
sw2917B-ms98-a-0031 157.621500 165.178750 and um when when you do that they automatically once you start with their service they close your accounts out
sw2917B-ms98-a-0032 165.178750 170.052625 so i'm still paying on all these accounts but [laughter] my accounts are closed
sw2917B-ms98-a-0033 170.052625 174.139500 so and i would prefer to keep it that way once we once we're paid off
sw2917B-ms98-a-0034 174.139500 175.334375 um
sw2917B-ms98-a-0035 175.334375 179.346375 i would prefer just to have one MasterCard and one Visa and that's it
sw2917B-ms98-a-0036 179.346375 185.104250 [silence]
sw2917B-ms98-a-0037 185.104250 193.282750 i think that's a really good way to handle it because that way if you if you paid off every month you never have to worry about well
sw2917B-ms98-a-0038 193.282750 202.377125 how much do i have to pay these guys you know this month you know this you buy what you can afford i mean if you handle it just like you would like a check or cash
sw2917B-ms98-a-0039 202.377125 205.400750 um it's a lot easier to keep it in check
sw2917B-ms98-a-0040 205.400750 208.965250 [silence]
sw2917B-ms98-a-0041 208.965250 209.970375 yeah

sw2917B-ms98-a-0045 223.061375 229.298500 yeah and i and i think at this at this point in time with the economy the way it is
sw2917B-ms98-a-0046 229.298500 230.341625 um
sw2917B-ms98-a-0047 230.341625 233.917875 i think that um it's going to get even worse
sw2917B-ms98-a-0048 233.917875 235.288000 um
sw2917B-ms98-a-0049 235.288000 239.740125 i'm i'm glad that we're starting to pay our debts o[ff]- off now
sw2917B-ms98-a-0050 239.740125 240.900500 um
sw2917B-ms98-a-0051 240.900500 241.996375 [silence]
sw2917B-ms98-a-0052 241.996375 245.310750 you know we s[tarted]- we s[tarted]- i mean we started this last year
sw2917B-ms98-a-0053 245.310750 251.184625 and we probably still have about another year to go before we're completely out of the hole
sw2917B-ms98-a-0054 251.184625 256.957000 but i think this they way the whole economy's is going right now it's just not good to be in debt
sw2917B-ms98-a-0055 256.957000 267.068875 [silence]

sw2917B-ms98-a-0060 278.992125 285.732125 well whe[n]- when it's you when you're getting rid of the whole credit card cycle and if you really get into the mind set
sw2917B-ms98-a-0061 285.732125 294.781500 i got really good at juggling money and basically robbing Peter to pay Paul and i and i it was scary because i was so good [laughter-at] it
sw2917B-ms98-a-0062 294.781500 304.612625 and i thought this this is not right i mean this has got to stop because eventually it'd end up catching up at and catching up with me and it hit me in the face
sw2917B-ms98-a-0063 304.612625 305.826625 um
sw2917B-ms98-a-0064 305.826625 309.579000 [silence]
sw2917B-ms98-a-0065 309.579000 318.783250 i yeah i have i've learned a lot from it um i've learned that credit cards are extremely dangerous in my hand [laughter]
sw2917B-ms98-a-0066 318.783250 322.356250 and my husband's too because he's he's the same way i am
sw2917B-ms98-a-0067 322.356250 324.337125 i don't i don't think that
sw2917B-ms98-a-0068 324.337125 329.680625 well when w[e]- when we buy on credit we just don't have a concept of how much money we're spending
sw2917B-ms98-a-0069 329.680625 331.418250 until the bill comes in
sw2917B-ms98-a-0070 331.418250 332.761875 [silence]
sw2917B-ms98-a-0071 332.761875 336.912750 and a[ll]- then all of a sudden you look at the bill and you go oh my gosh i spent this much [laughter]
sw2917B-ms98-a-0072 336.912750 343.915875 [silence]
sw2917B-ms98-a-0073 343.915875 349.872750 yeah we pretty much use them for for emergency type things like um
sw2917B-ms98-a-0074 349.872750 352.766250 transmission fell out on our car [laughter]
sw2917B-ms98-a-0075 352.766250 355.472875 and that paid for a new transmission
sw2917B-ms98-a-0076 355.472875 359.018125 um and and things like that um
sw2917B-ms98-a-0077 359.018125 362.727875 and we t[ry]- we try not to use them for you know
sw2917B-ms98-a-0078 362.727875 367.192000 incidental type things like you know gas and stuff like that
sw2917B-ms98-a-0079 367.192000 369.689000 [silence]
sw2917B-ms98-a-0080 369.689000 370.958750 yeah

sw2917B-ms98-a-0086 392.570250 401.688500 uh mind set for not not even getting you know past that thirty days i- i would that's ideally the where where i would like to be

sw2917B-ms98-a-0096 444.657125 446.206250 um-hum
sw2917B-ms98-a-0097 446.206250 448.998000 you think about what you can buy for sixty dollars
sw2917B-ms98-a-0098 448.998000 451.965500 [silence]
sw2917B-ms98-a-0099 451.965500 453.789000 yeah yeah

sw2917B-ms98-a-0101 455.097625 459.438250 i- i think about all all the money that that we've spent on interest
sw2917B-ms98-a-0102 459.438250 462.804750 on all of our credit cards and it's just incredible
sw2917B-ms98-a-0103 462.804750 467.088375 [silence]
sw2917B-ms98-a-0104 467.088375 473.713125 we've never been able to take it off our income tax i'm i'm fairly newly married i've only been married um less than two years
sw2917B-ms98-a-0105 473.713125 475.675875 and before that
sw2917B-ms98-a-0106 475.675875 479.971875 i never owned a home or anything so i never had any deductions
sw2917B-ms98-a-0107 479.971875 483.568000 so really it was always just money
sw2917B-ms98-a-0108 483.568000 485.364500 thrown away
sw2917B-ms98-a-0109 485.364500 488.810500 and i never really thought about it because
sw2917B-ms98-a-0110 488.810500 490.885000 uh 
sw2917B-ms98-a-0111 490.885000 496.440375 yeah i was so good at it that it just kind of got stuck in the back of my mind and just never
sw2917B-ms98-a-0112 496.440375 502.486750 um became a real problem until all of a sudden it came an insurmountable problem
sw2917B-ms98-a-0113 502.486750 518.136250 [silence]
sw2917B-ms98-a-0114 518.136250 519.530000 yeah
sw2917B-ms98-a-0115 519.530000 524.757750 most most people don't like to talk about money they feel uncomfortable i think
sw2917B-ms98-a-0116 524.757750 528.864750 you know because_1 i mean i guess for a lot of people it is very personal
sw2917B-ms98-a-0117 528.864750 533.246875 [silence]
sw2917B-ms98-a-0118 533.246875 534.395625 yeah

sw2917B-ms98-a-0120 537.023000 541.852375 but i- i think the the average American is probably
sw2917B-ms98-a-0121 541.852375 543.697250 pretty heavily in debt
sw2917B-ms98-a-0122 543.697250 544.934875 [silence]
sw2917B-ms98-a-0123 544.934875 549.677000 not not including like a mortgage i mean a mortgage is an understandable debt
sw2917B-ms98-a-0124 549.677000 552.779000 um because_1 that's you have you have to have a roof over your head
sw2917B-ms98-a-0125 552.779000 557.956875 and i would much rather own my own home than than
sw2917B-ms98-a-0126 557.956875 564.328375 be renting it like we're doing i mean we're basically you know kind of throwing seven hundred dollars a month away
sw2917B-ms98-a-0127 564.328375 565.858250 we're renting a house
sw2917B-ms98-a-0128 565.858250 566.575250 [silence]
sw2917B-ms98-a-0129 566.575250 567.975875 but

sw2917B-ms98-a-0131 568.809625 574.883500 but you know right now with the way our credit card situation is there's nobody in the world that's going to
sw2917B-ms98-a-0132 574.883500 576.746625 give us a mortgage on a house
sw2917B-ms98-a-0133 576.746625 582.550375 [silence]
sw2917B-ms98-a-0134 582.550375 583.798250 yeah
sw2917B-ms98-a-0135 583.798250 591.642250 yeah it's it's going to it's going to take quite a while um hopefully within five years we'll be in our own home
sw2917B-ms98-a-0136 591.642250 594.827875 but um i'm not really counting on it real soon
sw2917B-ms98-a-0137 594.827875 598.884375 [silence]
sw2917B-ms98-a-0138 598.884375 600.117375 yeah
