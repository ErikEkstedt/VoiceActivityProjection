sw2966A-ms98-a-0052 258.587750 259.933625 which is interesting
sw2966A-ms98-a-0053 259.933625 260.970750 [silence]
sw2966A-ms98-a-0054 260.970750 264.271000 instead of reading about the news you get to look at the pictures

sw2966A-ms98-a-0061 291.353000 293.550375 [silence]
sw2966A-ms98-a-0062 293.550375 296.940625 are there other things that you'd like them to to spend more time on
sw2966A-ms98-a-0063 296.940625 307.763375 they're they're very limited they have half hour to pr[ovide]- provide all the news weather sports and what not and uh most of the major stories are the same across all the ne[twork]- major networks but uh
sw2966A-ms98-a-0064 307.763375 309.952250 they do have uh
sw2966A-ms98-a-0065 309.952250 315.169000 uh scoops and specific stories that um i'll say one network that another one won't cover
sw2966A-ms98-a-0066 315.169000 320.448000 [silence]

sw2966A-ms98-a-0072 339.254750 349.026250 yeah i think it's good that we do get a lot of variety in news coverage although uh TV networks and uh there are radio stations that uh specifically cater to the news
sw2966A-ms98-a-0073 349.026250 361.636375 [silence]
sw2966A-ms98-a-0074 361.636375 367.045375 yeah well it's like i read a lot at work and i really have to make an effort to read anything when i get home
sw2966A-ms98-a-0075 367.045375 377.695500 i think that's why uh uh reading newspaper suffers to watching TV and TV is more entertaining uh it uh [laughter] usually have it on all the time when i'm at home whether i'm watching it or not
sw2966A-ms98-a-0076 377.695500 381.544000 [silence]

sw2966A-ms98-a-0078 383.534125 385.730625 that's uh that's a weekly chore
sw2966A-ms98-a-0079 385.730625 388.426875 get rid of the old newspapers that haven't been read
sw2966A-ms98-a-0080 388.426875 398.822750 [silence]
sw2966A-ms98-a-0081 398.822750 399.638625 yeah

sw2966A-ms98-a-0083 402.074375 410.580625 well i get the Sunday paper tomorrow and i'll pull out the TV section and put that aside and i get out the sports section and read that and then i start clipping coupons
sw2966A-ms98-a-0084 410.580625 418.823125 and if i have any time uh later in the week to read the rest of it i may pick it up and uh glance at it but uh i usually don't scan it cover to cover
sw2966A-ms98-a-0085 418.823125 426.052625 [silence]
sw2966A-ms98-a-0086 426.052625 427.002125 yeah

sw2966A-ms98-a-0090 433.683375 434.980500 that's interesting
sw2966A-ms98-a-0091 434.980500 436.434250 [silence]
sw2966A-ms98-a-0092 436.434250 437.336500 no

sw2966A-ms98-a-0100 471.172500 472.430375 uh-huh
sw2966A-ms98-a-0101 472.430375 481.308250 yeah well think that's that gets back to what i was saying before about uh the say the network news coverage they only have so much time to provide so much uh coverage of the news
sw2966A-ms98-a-0102 481.308250 487.251000 and they can't get very in depth in the with the within the limitations of the time that they have to present it
sw2966A-ms98-a-0103 487.251000 495.540375 [silence]
sw2966A-ms98-a-0104 495.540375 496.796125 well
sw2966A-ms98-a-0105 496.796125 508.611875 sure but uh you're talking about uh sensationalism here that you have to report the news and typically news is is uh or ty[pes]- the types of events that uh shock people or uh
sw2966A-ms98-a-0106 508.611875 511.350250 uh major crimes uh
sw2966A-ms98-a-0107 511.350250 520.232250 court cases things of that nature and most uh it's just a fact that most things that make news are are bad types of occurrences
sw2966A-ms98-a-0108 520.232250 523.265000 they aren't uh positive in nature
sw2966A-ms98-a-0109 523.265000 544.995750 [silence]
sw2966A-ms98-a-0110 544.995750 547.655875 yeah there is a show on
sw2966A-ms98-a-0111 547.655875 552.587125 there is a show on in fact it was on tonight at eight o'clock called Cops have you ever seen that
sw2966A-ms98-a-0112 552.587125 553.649250 [silence]
sw2966A-ms98-a-0113 553.649250 557.522375 that's very very interesting gives you a whole new perspective of the police department
sw2966A-ms98-a-0114 557.522375 567.614375 [silence]
sw2966A-ms98-a-0115 567.614375 568.546500 right
sw2966A-ms98-a-0116 568.546500 569.662625 [silence]
sw2966A-ms98-a-0117 569.662625 577.486000 yeah well i think they actually came up with that to show not just to to fill in on Saturday night but to promote the image of the police department
sw2966A-ms98-a-0118 577.486000 583.077375 because it does show uh what positive impact the police have in the society
sw2966A-ms98-a-0119 583.077375 586.213750 not just that they're always there when bad things happen
sw2966A-ms98-a-0120 586.213750 593.357875 [silence]
sw2966A-ms98-a-0121 593.357875 594.455000 oh yeah
