sw2966B-ms98-a-0021 78.424125 85.244500 yeah i enjoy just point blank reading basically the headlines and i go especially if i've seen something one way or the other and i hit the
sw2966B-ms98-a-0022 85.244500 88.428250 TV to find out actually what's going on around here
sw2966B-ms98-a-0023 88.428250 95.023625 [silence]
sw2966B-ms98-a-0024 95.023625 96.627500 oh it's same way here
sw2966B-ms98-a-0025 96.627500 103.917625 [silence]
sw2966B-ms98-a-0026 103.917625 105.994875 what about when um
sw2966B-ms98-a-0027 105.994875 107.986875 [noise] Desert Storm was on

sw2966B-ms98-a-0031 120.225000 127.924000 yeah well see i had the radio going on that almost all the time especially between jobs on that and that's when i hit the radio but
sw2966B-ms98-a-0032 127.924000 129.956125 when they stopped i stopped
sw2966B-ms98-a-0033 129.956125 135.199500 [silence]
sw2966B-ms98-a-0034 135.199500 137.405250 but uh now i like
sw2966B-ms98-a-0035 137.405250 141.773375 see i usually i hit the six o'clock and usually the ten
sw2966B-ms98-a-0036 141.773375 145.269125 but uh sometimes i have to search on ten because they get
sw2966B-ms98-a-0037 145.269125 150.302000 boring they pick up the same thing on six so i usually have to search to see if anything is come up or not
sw2966B-ms98-a-0038 150.302000 156.282250 [silence]
sw2966B-ms98-a-0039 156.282250 157.344250 right
sw2966B-ms98-a-0040 157.344250 169.813125 [silence]
sw2966B-ms98-a-0041 169.813125 171.578125 do you ever discuss at work
sw2966B-ms98-a-0042 171.578125 182.107125 [silence]
sw2966B-ms98-a-0043 182.107125 189.624750 now see usually when i was working at TI we hit about eight o'clock in the morning we all just [vocalized-noise] what was news and coming up and all so we ju[st]-
sw2966B-ms98-a-0044 189.624750 193.190000 hack it out between all of us one way or the other
sw2966B-ms98-a-0045 193.190000 194.581125 but uh
sw2966B-ms98-a-0046 194.581125 204.190250 [silence]
sw2966B-ms98-a-0047 204.190250 208.011750 well ours was kind of strange because we'd hit um
sw2966B-ms98-a-0048 208.011750 211.587625 since we were all females and uh
sw2966B-ms98-a-0049 211.587625 212.669000 [silence]
sw2966B-ms98-a-0050 212.669000 216.507250 we'd hit either the blacks because two of us were black
sw2966B-ms98-a-0051 216.507250 219.070125 o[ne]- one two three four of us are white
sw2966B-ms98-a-0052 219.070125 223.428375 and so it would be a cross between all of it going in together
sw2966B-ms98-a-0053 223.428375 228.906000 and uh i really enjoyed that i really enjoyed that because we got
sw2966B-ms98-a-0054 228.906000 233.348250 a cross section of viewpoints
sw2966B-ms98-a-0055 233.348250 237.396000 and it was fascinating in the morning so we ended up getting there well
sw2966B-ms98-a-0056 237.396000 240.244875 we were all there usually by seven thirty
sw2966B-ms98-a-0057 240.244875 242.965750 [silence]
sw2966B-ms98-a-0058 242.965750 248.848875 it wa[s]- it was fascinating it really was i really enjoyed it and i think everyone else did otherwise we wouldn't keep doing it every morning
sw2966B-ms98-a-0059 248.848875 249.937250 but
sw2966B-ms98-a-0060 249.937250 251.005375 [silence]
sw2966B-ms98-a-0061 251.005375 251.982250 no 
sw2966B-ms98-a-0062 251.982250 259.716500 [silence]
sw2966B-ms98-a-0063 259.716500 261.479750 oh that would be interesting
sw2966B-ms98-a-0064 261.479750 264.989625 [silence]
sw2966B-ms98-a-0065 264.989625 266.822250 i'm not uh
sw2966B-ms98-a-0066 266.822250 269.514375 i don't seem to find time to read
sw2966B-ms98-a-0067 269.514375 273.176000 too much except of the stuff i'm studying right now
sw2966B-ms98-a-0068 273.176000 276.610000 but uh news wise that way no
sw2966B-ms98-a-0069 276.610000 284.162875 but i have realized most of mine uh from the TV i think has increased watching the news
sw2966B-ms98-a-0070 284.162875 286.337000 since the since the war
sw2966B-ms98-a-0071 286.337000 291.636250 [silence]
sw2966B-ms98-a-0072 291.636250 293.108375 um
sw2966B-ms98-a-0073 293.108375 315.029375 [silence]
sw2966B-ms98-a-0074 315.029375 320.988875 well see i'm like as i said i pick up on Sixty Minutes or Twenty Twenty usually my favorite is Sixty Minutes
sw2966B-ms98-a-0075 320.988875 328.768250 and i'll pick up on them and find out what they're going to see and then i'll pick up the rest of the s[tories]- stories like that and get into like that but
sw2966B-ms98-a-0076 328.768250 330.562625 not uh
sw2966B-ms98-a-0077 330.562625 332.326500 [silence]
sw2966B-ms98-a-0078 332.326500 339.390250 most of the time if a really interesting one thing or another i'll go a little bit further but usually it's i just don't have the time
sw2966B-ms98-a-0079 339.390250 348.360375 [silence]
sw2966B-ms98-a-0080 348.360375 353.682875 but i can understand now why some of the newspaper's circulation has gone down
sw2966B-ms98-a-0081 353.682875 361.937250 because it's so much easier to watch the TV and keep at least ninety percent abreast and watching you know reading the newspaper and forget it
sw2966B-ms98-a-0082 361.937250 377.883375 [silence]
sw2966B-ms98-a-0083 377.883375 381.886750 well i got tired with newspapers because i seem to stack them_1 up without reading them_1
sw2966B-ms98-a-0084 381.886750 388.251375 [laughter-that's] [laughter-why] [laughter-i] [laughter-stopped] [laughter]
sw2966B-ms98-a-0085 388.251375 395.154875 i found out when i got the newspaper that it i'd read the headlines front page and maybe through a couple other sections and
sw2966B-ms98-a-0086 395.154875 402.626125 then i start packing them_1 up and i'm going i never read this what am i you know why even subscribe to it when i'm not reading it
sw2966B-ms98-a-0087 402.626125 419.412750 [silence]
sw2966B-ms98-a-0088 419.412750 426.325000 well see like when they have that recycle program on was it Save the Earth Save America i think what it was
sw2966B-ms98-a-0089 426.325000 431.353250 i watched that twice i recorded that because there were some things in there i wanted
sw2966B-ms98-a-0090 431.353250 436.677375 that i hadn't written down so i had recorded that but you can't find that in the newspaper
sw2966B-ms98-a-0091 436.677375 437.799500 [silence]
sw2966B-ms98-a-0092 437.799500 441.852875 but see i take that as far as my concern that's news to me
sw2966B-ms98-a-0093 441.852875 444.943000 because i enjoy something like that
sw2966B-ms98-a-0094 444.943000 446.796750 but uh
sw2966B-ms98-a-0095 446.796750 453.763875 i wonder about the rest of the world in itself how much they get or how much i talk to
sw2966B-ms98-a-0096 453.763875 459.929375 people that i work with at night now and the younger group they don't watch too much
sw2966B-ms98-a-0097 459.929375 464.627000 they don't even see it but i think they're being raised watching TV more than newspapers
sw2966B-ms98-a-0098 464.627000 467.680125 [silence]
sw2966B-ms98-a-0099 467.680125 471.699125 so i wish they'd put a little bit more depth in some of their stories
sw2966B-ms98-a-0100 471.699125 488.348000 [silence]
sw2966B-ms98-a-0101 488.348000 489.932875 i think they could
sw2966B-ms98-a-0102 489.932875 497.392625 use a little more of it a little bit wiser and put a little more positive in some of their stories than complete negative all the time
sw2966B-ms98-a-0103 497.392625 523.539125 [silence]
sw2966B-ms98-a-0104 523.539125 534.164500 well that's too true to a degree if they can put a complete half hour TV program on of what police have done to
sw2966B-ms98-a-0105 534.164500 536.297625 um
sw2966B-ms98-a-0106 536.297625 545.090500 or fireman you know off handed when they go in and find people or going down all all sorts of things you know what i'm talking about
sw2966B-ms98-a-0107 545.090500 548.080625 [laughter] sorry about that [laughter]
sw2966B-ms98-a-0108 548.080625 550.910750 [silence]
sw2966B-ms98-a-0109 550.910750 552.176625 right
sw2966B-ms98-a-0110 552.176625 554.539625 i've seen parts of it that's one of them
sw2966B-ms98-a-0111 554.539625 555.090875 [silence] 
sw2966B-ms98-a-0112 555.090875 556.094250 um
sw2966B-ms98-a-0113 556.094250 557.841000 [silence]
sw2966B-ms98-a-0114 557.841000 561.658250 there there is lots of stories out there about people what they've done
sw2966B-ms98-a-0115 561.658250 568.225625 out of you know stop on the highway and stop someone uh just because there was an accident one way or the other
sw2966B-ms98-a-0116 568.225625 569.852500 to me that's positive
sw2966B-ms98-a-0117 569.852500 586.801500 [silence]
sw2966B-ms98-a-0118 586.801500 591.751000 see so you wouldn't see like that's a cop show fine but there's positive in
sw2966B-ms98-a-0119 591.751000 593.664875 many different areas
sw2966B-ms98-a-0120 593.664875 595.925750 that they could push a little bit more on TV
sw2966B-ms98-a-0121 595.925750 599.813125 [silence]
