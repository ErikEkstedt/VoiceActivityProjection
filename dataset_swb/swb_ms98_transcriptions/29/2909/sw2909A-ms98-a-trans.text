sw2909A-ms98-a-0004 8.887875 17.319000 yeah um well i know that they're they're real cautious about letting Middle Eastern people into the country now because of all the terrorism
sw2909A-ms98-a-0005 17.319000 18.856250 what d[o]-
sw2909A-ms98-a-0006 18.856250 20.440000 w[hat]- what
sw2909A-ms98-a-0007 20.440000 22.533750 what all do you know about it
sw2909A-ms98-a-0008 22.533750 34.548750 [silence]
sw2909A-ms98-a-0009 34.548750 35.426500 yeah

sw2909A-ms98-a-0017 93.338375 101.389125 there i don't think there's much of much of one because i'm sure all the people from Cuba have been released from that camp that they were in
sw2909A-ms98-a-0018 101.389125 113.015625 and uh most of them it's just like Australia most of them were criminals from Cuba and i think that was just an attempt that that Fidel Castro to undermine you know
sw2909A-ms98-a-0019 113.015625 120.312250 the United States to some extent so he just released and got rid of all his criminals and sent them_1 to us
sw2909A-ms98-a-0020 120.312250 125.236125 and it's almost the same thing in in uh from Asia because
sw2909A-ms98-a-0021 125.236125 131.504000 a lot o[f]- a lot of them was put out of business in Vietnam after the war and

sw2909A-ms98-a-0031 197.844875 204.276250 yeah and uh a lot of the Mexican people just cross the border during the daytime to come over here and work
sw2909A-ms98-a-0032 204.276250 211.672750 and they have green cards and uh then like you said a lot of i run into people every day that can't speak English
sw2909A-ms98-a-0033 211.672750 213.191875 and uh
sw2909A-ms98-a-0034 213.191875 218.149125 and and most of them you know are working in janitorial positions so
sw2909A-ms98-a-0035 218.149125 219.340125 [silence]
sw2909A-ms98-a-0036 219.340125 225.036000 so i i don't know you like you said i don't know how much how much they're taking from the work force you know
sw2909A-ms98-a-0037 225.036000 229.554000 [silence]

sw2909A-ms98-a-0045 272.038125 278.207500 well that's i yeah i took Spanish in school and that's you know one reason that i did it is because
sw2909A-ms98-a-0046 278.207500 284.321750 because_1 whenever you travel anywhere near the border you know there more and more people speak Spanish
sw2909A-ms98-a-0047 284.321750 302.013500 [silence]
sw2909A-ms98-a-0048 302.013500 314.001750 well yeah well it's basically on the well i think it's mostly concentrated toward the borders and uh it's more um the immigration is tied in with uh drug trafficking so
sw2909A-ms98-a-0049 314.001750 325.677000 they have to watch out who comes in and and they're always finding drugs on you know on the most um innocent looking kind of
sw2909A-ms98-a-0050 325.677000 331.525750 i forgot what they found but a dog found it the other day you know on on the border
sw2909A-ms98-a-0051 331.525750 345.876750 [silence]
sw2909A-ms98-a-0052 345.876750 347.250625 um-hum
sw2909A-ms98-a-0053 347.250625 372.017750 [silence]
sw2909A-ms98-a-0054 372.017750 374.184500 that's right yeah
sw2909A-ms98-a-0055 374.184500 375.085750 y[eah]-
sw2909A-ms98-a-0056 375.085750 378.888375 [silence]
sw2909A-ms98-a-0057 378.888375 390.553375 yeah and one of the one of the things that really gets to me uh about the Mexicans is that um once they have children over here their children are American citizens then
sw2909A-ms98-a-0058 390.553375 392.345375 [silence]
sw2909A-ms98-a-0059 392.345375 397.608500 yeah and then they'll ship the parents back and that leaves the children without any parents so
sw2909A-ms98-a-0060 397.608500 398.720250 [silence]
sw2909A-ms98-a-0061 398.720250 403.536500 and they you know and they and and they just follow the rule no matter you you know
sw2909A-ms98-a-0062 403.536500 406.056625 so that doesn't seem fair to the children
sw2909A-ms98-a-0063 406.056625 410.749375 [silence]
sw2909A-ms98-a-0064 410.749375 412.147000 right

sw2909A-ms98-a-0066 413.598375 419.918000 [silence]
sw2909A-ms98-a-0067 419.918000 428.123375 yeah and then they granted them_1 amnesty if they could prove when was that and it was in the eighties sometime if they if they could prove they'd been here five years
sw2909A-ms98-a-0068 428.123375 434.512750 and uh a lot of them_1 had been you know some of them_1 some of them_1 moved back and forth but uh
sw2909A-ms98-a-0069 434.512750 439.084250 most of them_1 don't ever want to go back to Mexico especially the way it was then
sw2909A-ms98-a-0070 439.084250 442.620000 [silence]
sw2909A-ms98-a-0071 442.620000 443.652625 um-hum
sw2909A-ms98-a-0072 443.652625 448.847875 [silence]
sw2909A-ms98-a-0073 448.847875 454.260125 i think most you know like especially the celebrities and everything they just have a
sw2909A-ms98-a-0074 454.260125 459.666500 uh well they have to get a green card if they're going to do any kind of work you know in the movies and
sw2909A-ms98-a-0075 459.666500 463.176500 and such but most of them_1 have temporary visas
sw2909A-ms98-a-0076 463.176500 469.228750 [silence]
sw2909A-ms98-a-0077 469.228750 472.522250 as long it's like well i[t's]- it's a kind of a
sw2909A-ms98-a-0078 472.522250 477.198875 a bad a bad example but when Rafael Septien
sw2909A-ms98-a-0079 477.198875 484.413500 took the job with the Cowboys they had to offer his job to any other applicant that could do it
sw2909A-ms98-a-0080 484.413500 485.798625 yeah
sw2909A-ms98-a-0081 485.798625 488.919750 so that you know and that's the thing with the jobs
sw2909A-ms98-a-0082 488.919750 492.328625 and of course no one beat him out so you know
sw2909A-ms98-a-0083 492.328625 494.768500 he just ruined his own career so
sw2909A-ms98-a-0084 494.768500 495.831875 yeah
sw2909A-ms98-a-0085 495.831875 520.620000 [silence]
sw2909A-ms98-a-0086 520.620000 521.590500 um-hum
sw2909A-ms98-a-0087 521.590500 540.932750 [silence]
sw2909A-ms98-a-0088 540.932750 542.830750 yeah i think so
sw2909A-ms98-a-0089 542.830750 548.245750 because there are other uh j[ob]- uh uh job opportunities in Europe that there aren't here and
sw2909A-ms98-a-0090 548.245750 559.171250 you know even um like or[chestra]- orchestra players can find a job sometimes in Europe when they can't find one here and um i'm a trumpet player
sw2909A-ms98-a-0091 559.171250 565.385000 uh no i uh i don't anymore i just went to school and i was a music major for a while
sw2909A-ms98-a-0092 565.385000 571.783250 but i had a trumpet teacher that played in the Mexico City Symphony so so he had to have a work visa there
sw2909A-ms98-a-0093 571.783250 578.290000 and of course they had a lot of musicians from from other countries and uh in the Mexico City Symphony
sw2909A-ms98-a-0094 578.290000 581.921625 but i think um like three out of the four
sw2909A-ms98-a-0095 581.921625 585.553375 other people in the trumpet section are from Mexico now
sw2909A-ms98-a-0096 585.553375 586.932750 [silence]
sw2909A-ms98-a-0097 586.932750 592.492375 but i think the conductor i don't know or one of the conductors is is from another country
sw2909A-ms98-a-0098 592.492375 594.519750 it's like any other symphony
sw2909A-ms98-a-0099 594.519750 595.568000 [silence]
sw2909A-ms98-a-0100 595.568000 599.272375 you know and then and Eduardo Mana's from Mexico so
sw2909A-ms98-a-0101 599.272375 600.868500 so he had to you kn[ow]-
