sw2909B-ms98-a-0008 23.127375 30.308000 uh well i just have an opinion now i didn't think i i thought the terrorism thing was overstated i mean there was nothing over here in fact even
sw2909B-ms98-a-0009 30.308000 32.866250 this is not our subject i guess but uh
sw2909B-ms98-a-0010 32.866250 34.740000 or maybe it is or isn't i suppose
sw2909B-ms98-a-0011 34.740000 45.352500 my wife when she talked about the Middle East and everyone's afraid you know of how the war was going to go and everything i sai[d]- i said i told her no it's just not going to happen there's not going to be any terrorism over here and there wasn't you know 
sw2909B-ms98-a-0012 45.352500 48.224750 th[ey]- they just didn't have an organization but uh
sw2909B-ms98-a-0013 48.224750 54.314500 i i c[oncerned]- i'm concerned that we're letting too many that we don't have enough controls i think that uh
sw2909B-ms98-a-0014 54.314500 67.862500 the Asian gangsters that we've let in here and if and the guys from uh Cuba you know there there's a lot of criminals down in Florida that we've let in from Cuba that Fidel pushed off on us and uh
sw2909B-ms98-a-0015 67.862500 80.320375 a[nd]- and the last you know out of all the Asians we brought in there there's a tremendous criminal element that we let in from from Asia and i think that there's got to be some sort of controls over that i mean this Asia mafia thing is getting out of hand
sw2909B-ms98-a-0016 80.320375 85.376125 i- i don't i don't i didn't know what i don't even know what our controls are i don't even know what uh
sw2909B-ms98-a-0017 85.376125 89.495625 uh w[e]- if we have any guidelines at all uh on on immigration um
sw2909B-ms98-a-0018 89.495625 93.615125 i always thought that we did but i don't i don't i don't i don't know what they are right now

sw2909B-ms98-a-0030 130.558625 143.034000 i i do have some sympathy with uh you know of course we have this big Mexican prob[lem]- not a problem but i think that we need to do something with uh the immigration of back and ac[ross]- forth across
sw2909B-ms98-a-0031 143.034000 145.372375 Mexico uh
sw2909B-ms98-a-0032 145.372375 147.360125 i
sw2909B-ms98-a-0033 147.360125 157.284500 uh i'm sympathe[tic]- i don't know what the answer is i guess i'm sympathetic certainly with that that that they they want to come over here and they i guess hundreds of thousands come over every year to work
sw2909B-ms98-a-0034 157.284500 162.857500 and i[f]- if they h[ave]- if they have jobs you know i i hear the story about they're taking away American jobs but i don't know
sw2909B-ms98-a-0035 162.857500 171.119750 uh i don't know how many American jobs they are really taking away i'm so i i'm sympathetic but i don't have an answer i don't uh
sw2909B-ms98-a-0036 171.119750 180.639750 i think that we should have good relations with with Mexico that's not really exactly immigration it is and it isn't uh i i don't know to what degree we owe 
sw2909B-ms98-a-0037 180.639750 186.673000 the people who come across before they're citizens owe the children education and all that uh 
sw2909B-ms98-a-0038 186.673000 191.095375 although the i[dea]- their education is an answer to a lot of problems in the world so
sw2909B-ms98-a-0039 191.095375 194.507125 i guess it's what they their the Mexican kids get a
sw2909B-ms98-a-0040 194.507125 197.918875 good education along the way maybe that's a benefit to everybody you know

sw2909B-ms98-a-0050 224.083125 230.162875 yeah i never thought that they were much i do cringe when i hear some of the problems we've had
sw2909B-ms98-a-0051 230.162875 231.934000 uh um uh
sw2909B-ms98-a-0052 231.934000 238.634125 of course you mentioned the language i i feel so bad that we here in Texas or certainly the southern part of the United States uh
sw2909B-ms98-a-0053 238.634125 244.790250 California Texas and all that j[ust]- why our kids don't speak fluid Spanish uh
sw2909B-ms98-a-0054 244.790250 248.551000 by junior high you know um as well as us you know
sw2909B-ms98-a-0055 248.551000 252.951000 so that we could wouldn't have a language barrier certainly now that is a shame that we
sw2909B-ms98-a-0056 252.951000 265.960875 uh have this tremendous border of Mexico and the[n]- in Europe you know they they speak their French and all and they try they go out of their way to try to speak their their neighbor's language so they can understand we we cert[ainly]- we don't really even make an effort
sw2909B-ms98-a-0057 265.960875 268.943375 to speak Spanish and i feel bad about that

sw2909B-ms98-a-0064 285.126000 293.094875 i guess it's never too late i i do have some Spanish books and i've always uh every year i say i'm going to try to speak uh some newcomers language you know
sw2909B-ms98-a-0065 293.094875 294.274375 [silence]
sw2909B-ms98-a-0066 294.274375 302.256750 i don't know if it's costing us any money or how much money they're putting into it uh that's always a factor i mean how much my wife says they how much the federal government is putting into
sw2909B-ms98-a-0067 302.256750 303.440750 immigration
sw2909B-ms98-a-0068 303.440750 324.429375 [silence]

sw2909B-ms98-a-0073 331.809875 335.478875 oh yeah i i think that certainly is a problem uh
sw2909B-ms98-a-0074 335.478875 340.418125 i guess our immigration history that's a great subject uh they didn't say to talk about that but that is
sw2909B-ms98-a-0075 340.418125 346.946250 i mean uh on Ellis Island they you know they're redoing that and going to make it a museum a national museum
sw2909B-ms98-a-0076 346.946250 350.388375 now that certainly was interesting since all of us had
sw2909B-ms98-a-0077 350.388375 357.221625 uh ancestors that came over that way or not all but i guess uh i guess if you go back far enough you came over on a
sw2909B-ms98-a-0078 357.221625 358.877000 uh
sw2909B-ms98-a-0079 358.877000 361.556750 a boat originally you know but uh
sw2909B-ms98-a-0080 361.556750 365.817125 a lot of us have parents grandparents my grandparents came over in
sw2909B-ms98-a-0081 365.817125 369.779625 about eighteen ninety or something like that and i'm sure they came over
sw2909B-ms98-a-0082 369.779625 372.405250 you know through Ellis Island you know
sw2909B-ms98-a-0083 372.405250 373.925125 [silence]
sw2909B-ms98-a-0084 373.925125 379.867500 so uh we all immigrants in one way or or another well we certainly are coming from Europe you know or not
sw2909B-ms98-a-0085 379.867500 390.257875 [silence]
sw2909B-ms98-a-0086 390.257875 393.245000 oh yeah tha[t]- those were laws are unusual you know
sw2909B-ms98-a-0087 393.245000 396.438500 [silence]
sw2909B-ms98-a-0088 396.438500 399.670000 yeah that i don't understand i mean uh whose rule is that you know
sw2909B-ms98-a-0089 399.670000 405.460000 [silence]
sw2909B-ms98-a-0090 405.460000 411.250125 yeah sometimes common sense should take over rather than yeah that's a law doesn't sound like it makes any sense at all
sw2909B-ms98-a-0091 411.250125 413.193375 that you would do it that way
sw2909B-ms98-a-0092 413.193375 420.137125 you would think they could at least get a a a visa or something until they uh got citizenship i'm sure they want to
sw2909B-ms98-a-0093 420.137125 424.645625 [silence]

sw2909B-ms98-a-0103 438.697625 441.468250 oh no i i could see uh
sw2909B-ms98-a-0104 441.468250 443.375250 you can see why
sw2909B-ms98-a-0105 443.375250 447.791375 i don't know how much immigration we have from Europe and everything what the controls are

sw2909B-ms98-a-0123 497.664375 501.701375 yeah well i[t's]- it's still interesting after all this time that we're probably one of the
sw2909B-ms98-a-0124 501.701375 507.127875 one of the few countries that people are still you know desperately trying to immigrate to
sw2909B-ms98-a-0125 507.127875 508.149625 [silence]
sw2909B-ms98-a-0126 508.149625 513.193125 uh although i guess Europe now that the Communism is falling apart that maybe there'll be
sw2909B-ms98-a-0127 513.193125 517.046000 won't be that much of a rush to get out of all the Communist Comm[unist]- countries uh
sw2909B-ms98-a-0128 517.046000 518.092375 [silence]
sw2909B-ms98-a-0129 518.092375 521.034875 i guess Poland now i[s]- now a non Communist so
sw2909B-ms98-a-0130 521.034875 526.028625 maybe not maybe immigration from Europe to here will s[lowly]- you know slowly
sw2909B-ms98-a-0131 526.028625 532.427875 uh change maybe it'll be even out like trade you know so many people will
sw2909B-ms98-a-0132 532.427875 536.921750 immigrate here i[n]- in the twentieth at at the year two thousand
sw2909B-ms98-a-0133 536.921750 541.415750 so many of the people who will go back overseas you know maybe it'll average out i don't know
sw2909B-ms98-a-0134 541.415750 543.366750 it doesn't has doesn't seem so far but
