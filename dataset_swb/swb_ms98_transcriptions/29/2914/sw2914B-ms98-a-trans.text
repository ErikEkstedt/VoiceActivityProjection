sw2914B-ms98-a-0002 4.004125 8.472375 oh they range from
sw2914B-ms98-a-0003 8.472375 12.541625 from needlepoint to
sw2914B-ms98-a-0004 12.541625 18.079000 uh anything in the hobby field as far as um needlework is concerned
sw2914B-ms98-a-0005 18.079000 31.565375 i've had to give it up recently because um i've got problems with uh nerves in my right hand but basically it's anything in that hobby line i'll try anything including making uh earrings
sw2914B-ms98-a-0006 31.565375 33.261125 [silence]
sw2914B-ms98-a-0007 33.261125 37.017000 i have no love of yard work for hobby work though how about_1 you
sw2914B-ms98-a-0008 37.017000 43.431500 [silence]
sw2914B-ms98-a-0009 43.431500 45.430000 oh fantastic
sw2914B-ms98-a-0010 45.430000 58.896375 [silence]
sw2914B-ms98-a-0011 58.896375 60.499750 oh
sw2914B-ms98-a-0012 60.499750 69.273000 [silence]
sw2914B-ms98-a-0013 69.273000 71.410000 i've been in a uh
sw2914B-ms98-a-0014 71.410000 72.951125 glider
sw2914B-ms98-a-0015 72.951125 75.545125 which as a student [piot/pilot] pilot
sw2914B-ms98-a-0016 75.545125 77.638250 i loved it immensely
sw2914B-ms98-a-0017 77.638250 79.836250 [silence]
sw2914B-ms98-a-0018 79.836250 81.950375 as a student pilot yeah
sw2914B-ms98-a-0019 81.950375 83.416125 [silence]
sw2914B-ms98-a-0020 83.416125 85.959750 uh i was only in one one trip
sw2914B-ms98-a-0021 85.959750 87.228250 [silence]
sw2914B-ms98-a-0022 87.228250 93.376250 it was something i would have liked to have kept up but we moved out of Colorado so that was you know that ended that point
sw2914B-ms98-a-0023 93.376250 100.311000 but yeah that i'll try as far as you could say hobby then i'll try anything that's unusual that i've never done once
sw2914B-ms98-a-0024 100.311000 104.737000 just to find out what it's like the experience oh as
sw2914B-ms98-a-0025 104.737000 114.918000 but that's not a constant hobby you know like i'll do uh oh i'll pick up normally a petit point or anything in stitchery type of line
sw2914B-ms98-a-0026 114.918000 118.876250 and if i'm really bored i'll even pick up something and color it
sw2914B-ms98-a-0027 118.876250 121.984375 but i do a lot of designing also
sw2914B-ms98-a-0028 121.984375 130.857375 [silence]
sw2914B-ms98-a-0029 130.857375 136.866375 well i've done a petit point which is really extremely hard
sw2914B-ms98-a-0030 136.866375 143.750625 and uh that was very difficult for me it took me oh i think that almost took me a year and a half to finish that
sw2914B-ms98-a-0031 143.750625 147.022125 and petit point is like if you've seen
sw2914B-ms98-a-0032 147.022125 150.633750 regular needlepoint it's one half of that in the stitches
sw2914B-ms98-a-0033 150.633750 155.432750 and it goes down like real small little tiny it's exactly what it says petit point
sw2914B-ms98-a-0034 155.432750 156.574000 [silence]
sw2914B-ms98-a-0035 156.574000 163.468125 yes it was tedious i dropped it as i said it took me about a year and a half because_1 it's not something i could continuously do
sw2914B-ms98-a-0036 163.468125 172.772375 but now i'm into more uh taking something that i like and trying to actually put it onto paper myself
sw2914B-ms98-a-0037 172.772375 178.086875 which i find more enjoyment that's got a lot of math to it at that point
sw2914B-ms98-a-0038 178.086875 179.430500 [silence]
sw2914B-ms98-a-0039 179.430500 187.320750 uh this last one i'm trying to do a house there's a house here in Plano actually it's a real estate office
sw2914B-ms98-a-0040 187.320750 190.108125 but it has
sw2914B-ms98-a-0041 190.108125 198.008750 it's oh i would say it every section of this real estate office is a different type of a structure
sw2914B-ms98-a-0042 198.008750 212.209375 it goes from almost um castle looking on one side to a very old fashioned look on the other side and it just varies in each little section of this real estate office
sw2914B-ms98-a-0043 212.209375 216.154625 and i think they did it because of that purpose it is a real estate office
sw2914B-ms98-a-0044 216.154625 224.199250 but it fascinates me the way they've done it and it's it looks good it's all done in brick the windows even vary on it
sw2914B-ms98-a-0045 224.199250 230.991625 and that's it really fascinates me so i've sat across the street from it and i've tried to put it down on the paper now
sw2914B-ms98-a-0046 230.991625 235.594000 [silence]
sw2914B-ms98-a-0047 235.594000 238.550875 it's on um
sw2914B-ms98-a-0048 238.550875 242.447250 let's see fifteenth and uh Park
sw2914B-ms98-a-0049 242.447250 245.106250 [silence]
sw2914B-ms98-a-0050 245.106250 247.770750 well i live right around here
sw2914B-ms98-a-0051 247.770750 250.658250 but it's not if you drive by it you don't notice it
sw2914B-ms98-a-0052 250.658250 258.042375 because it's all brick there's no difference in the front except you can see the little difference if you actually stop and take a look at it
sw2914B-ms98-a-0053 258.042375 259.967500 that's why it fascinates me
sw2914B-ms98-a-0054 259.967500 261.050875 [silence]
sw2914B-ms98-a-0055 261.050875 266.450375 but uh again you know i'd like to be able to go ahead and take that someday and actually make a house of my own
sw2914B-ms98-a-0056 266.450375 275.685250 [silence]
sw2914B-ms98-a-0057 275.685250 280.369250 well see you're doing the same thing when you're doing your gazebo you're playing with numbers
sw2914B-ms98-a-0058 280.369250 281.871250 [silence]
sw2914B-ms98-a-0059 281.871250 285.795000 that's all this is you putting it on paper so you're just playing with numbers
sw2914B-ms98-a-0060 285.795000 287.021750 [silence]
sw2914B-ms98-a-0061 287.021750 291.365125 it's like i would love to play with work but i don't have the strength in my hands
sw2914B-ms98-a-0062 291.365125 296.196875 anymore to do anything like that but i've put up uh
sw2914B-ms98-a-0063 296.196875 301.237250 like um a wall board fixed a bedroom and put in a bath
sw2914B-ms98-a-0064 301.237250 332.420625 [silence]
sw2914B-ms98-a-0065 332.420625 337.943750 yeah i have a small miter box uh for hobby mitering
sw2914B-ms98-a-0066 337.943750 352.251875 and it does the same thing what you're saying but i'd like to which i've been trying to find to go into as far as a permanent hobby which because i'm having difficulties with this is to go into uh i'm sure you've seen it is those wood
sw2914B-ms98-a-0067 352.251875 353.889375 uh
sw2914B-ms98-a-0068 353.889375 361.486375 oh they're they're wood pictures on the wall but if one move if one part moves it counterparts the other parts
sw2914B-ms98-a-0069 361.486375 365.086125 and so like it's a continuous counterpart around it
sw2914B-ms98-a-0070 365.086125 366.861250 and it's all made out of wood
sw2914B-ms98-a-0071 366.861250 368.002750 [silence]
sw2914B-ms98-a-0072 368.002750 371.021375 and i have as i said i have a miniature uh
sw2914B-ms98-a-0073 371.021375 374.465125 miter box which is made for hobby works
sw2914B-ms98-a-0074 374.465125 381.634250 and i've had that for quite a few years now but i haven't really gone into that part i've been thinking about making um
sw2914B-ms98-a-0075 381.634250 396.092000 oh ladders and everything for my uh pocket parrot because they're hard to find toys for a pocket parrot they make them_1 for parrots and they make them_1 for cockatiels and a pocket parrot's between the two
sw2914B-ms98-a-0076 396.092000 410.857125 and so i need rings that are exactly between those two sizes so i'm going to i've got some designs for i go into the pet stores but you can say again another hobby i've got is my birds so
sw2914B-ms98-a-0077 410.857125 412.215875 hum
sw2914B-ms98-a-0078 412.215875 414.430000 i have a cockatiel and a pocket parrot
sw2914B-ms98-a-0079 414.430000 417.007750 [silence]
sw2914B-ms98-a-0080 417.007750 418.764125 but um
sw2914B-ms98-a-0081 418.764125 420.358625 other than that
sw2914B-ms98-a-0082 420.358625 421.546000 [silence]
sw2914B-ms98-a-0083 421.546000 426.410000 uh Sam uh cockatiel talks he whistles at me and says good morning
sw2914B-ms98-a-0084 426.410000 436.031000 uh he picked up most of his sayings from the other cockatiel i had the pocket parrot is a very quiet bird it's an extremely tame bird
sw2914B-ms98-a-0085 436.031000 442.758875 it's uh if you're real gentle with it when you buy it it'll come out and sit on your shoulder with no problem
sw2914B-ms98-a-0086 442.758875 443.907625 [silence]
sw2914B-ms98-a-0087 443.907625 446.446875 yeah they're a very very tender bird
sw2914B-ms98-a-0088 446.446875 464.216750 [silence]
sw2914B-ms98-a-0089 464.216750 469.050625 well see when i was oh about i guess about ten years ago fifteen years ago
sw2914B-ms98-a-0090 469.050625 474.930125 i don't know if it's been that long i took my dog my cat and my bird into the vet at the same time
sw2914B-ms98-a-0091 474.930125 488.483625 and he was just sitting there he goes Carol you're the only one i know of that does this and i go what's the problem because i never thought about it i had never thought one thing at all about it and of course the dog and the cat and the bird are all out of the cage
sw2914B-ms98-a-0092 488.483625 493.876750 and uh m[y]- my bird at that time was picking the feathers out from underneath his wing
sw2914B-ms98-a-0093 493.876750 505.219625 and uh he finally said well you ought to get it a mate but the bird turned around and bit him he was furious he was so mad at me but yeah he had a picture of my birds
sw2914B-ms98-a-0094 505.219625 514.299125 sitting on top of the cage with one tail inside of a front of a cat's face and the tail of another cat walking underneath the cage
sw2914B-ms98-a-0095 514.299125 517.863750 so he just loved it he just absolutely adored it
sw2914B-ms98-a-0096 517.863750 522.811500 [silence]
sw2914B-ms98-a-0097 522.811500 533.604750 well the one large cat that i still have uh he took claw marks and put it down my drapes going after the birds sitting out on a
sw2914B-ms98-a-0098 533.604750 536.903500 bird rack that we set up outside for birds
sw2914B-ms98-a-0099 536.903500 538.755750 going after the birds
sw2914B-ms98-a-0100 538.755750 552.612250 and then he'd get down and jump back up on the table and sit next to a cage that had two cockatiels out on top of the cage i'd get so mad at that cat because_1 i didn't realize what he was doing until i saw these big claw marks going down my
sw2914B-ms98-a-0101 552.612250 555.189250 drapes from his back claws
sw2914B-ms98-a-0102 555.189250 556.447875 [silence]
sw2914B-ms98-a-0103 556.447875 563.766750 yeah i didn't think i didn't appreciate it too much i mean it's rather i thought it was rather funny here's a bird doing this and two birds sitting right next to him but
sw2914B-ms98-a-0104 563.766750 565.000000 [silence]
sw2914B-ms98-a-0105 565.000000 577.619000 i mean the birds were out they weren't in the cage they were out i never left them_1 in so but i thought but i still have that cat in fact i have both cats which are my kids' cats but the birds are in here with the cats they don't care
sw2914B-ms98-a-0106 577.619000 581.484000 they keep an eye on any cat that walks outside but they don't care about these cats
sw2914B-ms98-a-0107 581.484000 583.651125 [silence]
sw2914B-ms98-a-0108 583.651125 586.230750 i don't know what it is i've seen
sw2914B-ms98-a-0109 586.230750 588.949375 [silence]
sw2914B-ms98-a-0110 588.949375 591.936875 i've heard a lot of people that doesn't work that way
sw2914B-ms98-a-0111 591.936875 598.579750 i mean i've seen that dog my son's dog open up it's mouth and absolutely put it totally around the cat's head
sw2914B-ms98-a-0112 598.579750 599.494500 and the
