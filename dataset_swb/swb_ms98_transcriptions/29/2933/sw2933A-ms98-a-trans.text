sw2933A-ms98-a-0009 41.500000 43.972000 then you don't get the benefit

sw2933A-ms98-a-0015 80.561500 84.387500 i think medical is probably one of the most important things
sw2933A-ms98-a-0016 84.387500 85.993000 to have
sw2933A-ms98-a-0017 85.993000 106.880750 [silence]

sw2933A-ms98-a-0037 239.969000 248.304000 won't let them_1 stay any longer it frustrates him because they'll just be getting somebody to the point where they can really make some progress and then they're gone
sw2933A-ms98-a-0038 248.304000 261.077750 [silence]

sw2933A-ms98-a-0044 278.200500 284.632625 does your husband's company have any of the new like a cafeteria plan where he gets to pick and chose any of his benefits
sw2933A-ms98-a-0045 284.632625 307.546750 [silence]
sw2933A-ms98-a-0046 307.546750 309.119750 right
sw2933A-ms98-a-0047 309.119750 318.552375 yeah that's one thing i wish that we had was like a 401K plan or one of those things were they matched what you could save those are really good deals
sw2933A-ms98-a-0048 318.552375 328.320250 [silence]

sw2933A-ms98-a-0050 330.360500 335.635250 that or retire i don't think we can plan on social security taking care of us so
sw2933A-ms98-a-0051 335.635250 362.815250 [silence]
sw2933A-ms98-a-0052 362.815250 369.296750 yeah with what they say about how the population's changing i think attitudes'll have to change to go along with that
sw2933A-ms98-a-0053 369.296750 371.474500 [silence]
sw2933A-ms98-a-0054 371.474500 377.180125 and that'll probably change the insurance benefits too as people get older and still work and
sw2933A-ms98-a-0055 377.180125 379.478625 they'll need more health care
sw2933A-ms98-a-0056 379.478625 385.683000 [silence]
sw2933A-ms98-a-0057 385.683000 387.024000 so

sw2933A-ms98-a-0068 438.945875 448.924625 to get maternity benefits was just ridiculous i mean you c[ould]- you might as well have saved the money you paid every month and paid your own hospital bill at the end of the year or something
