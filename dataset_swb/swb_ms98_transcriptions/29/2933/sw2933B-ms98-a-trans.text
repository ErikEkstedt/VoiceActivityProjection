sw2933B-ms98-a-0008 20.670000 23.117625 um-hum they
sw2933B-ms98-a-0009 23.117625 29.667500 but do they uh determine your benefits on whether or not you do work those hours or
sw2933B-ms98-a-0010 29.667500 41.819250 [silence]
sw2933B-ms98-a-0011 41.819250 45.161375 then they uh adjust it accordingly

sw2933B-ms98-a-0013 46.226125 47.494875 [laughter]
sw2933B-ms98-a-0014 47.494875 54.297750 my uh husband works for a a large oil company and
sw2933B-ms98-a-0015 54.297750 62.115000 they uh and in the past has worked for a computer company and a bank so we've always uh
sw2933B-ms98-a-0016 62.115000 65.206250 always had access to to good
sw2933B-ms98-a-0017 65.206250 71.000500 benefits as far as insurance and and usually some dental and
sw2933B-ms98-a-0018 71.000500 72.001750 [silence]
sw2933B-ms98-a-0019 72.001750 76.535250 life insurance and that kind of thing you know and
sw2933B-ms98-a-0020 76.535250 78.282125 [silence]
sw2933B-ms98-a-0021 78.282125 81.217000 yeah exactly
sw2933B-ms98-a-0022 81.217000 84.114250 [silence]
sw2933B-ms98-a-0023 84.114250 92.029000 i know uh here sometime back you know they ha[d]- had had given him a printout you know of uh
sw2933B-ms98-a-0024 92.029000 97.537125 money that the company had paid into stock in his name and how much he'd paid and
sw2933B-ms98-a-0025 97.537125 107.712250 um the medical benefits and whatnot that uh he was entitled to and they estimated those benefits at about forty percent of his salary
sw2933B-ms98-a-0026 107.712250 112.547000 even including vacation like you said and paid holidays and
sw2933B-ms98-a-0027 112.547000 124.490375 and uh all of those things now some of those you look at and you say well i'm not going to need that or use that benefit but i guess it's there knowing that it could be used if you
sw2933B-ms98-a-0028 124.490375 126.327000 so chose
sw2933B-ms98-a-0029 126.327000 130.432250 [silence]
sw2933B-ms98-a-0030 130.432250 131.762125 yeah
sw2933B-ms98-a-0031 131.762125 137.732375 yeah i uh we've always been dealt fairly with that way
sw2933B-ms98-a-0032 137.732375 141.060375 and i would certainly you know
sw2933B-ms98-a-0033 141.060375 150.734375 caution any young person going into you know looking at jobs to make sure that they truly know what those benefits are and
sw2933B-ms98-a-0034 150.734375 158.618500 how they're going to match up and it might be wise to take a lower salary or hourly wage
sw2933B-ms98-a-0035 158.618500 162.406000 if you knew that uh long term the
sw2933B-ms98-a-0036 162.406000 167.147500 you were going to get more of a profit sharing or you know or just you know
sw2933B-ms98-a-0037 167.147500 170.376000 whatever you know the differences in the
sw2933B-ms98-a-0038 170.376000 177.846750 you know in the benefits we belong to an HMO through my husband's work is do you is that the kind of medical
sw2933B-ms98-a-0039 177.846750 179.370000 you have
sw2933B-ms98-a-0040 179.370000 185.444375 [silence]
sw2933B-ms98-a-0041 185.444375 187.019125 um-hum
sw2933B-ms98-a-0042 187.019125 188.357375 [silence]
sw2933B-ms98-a-0043 188.357375 190.248125 well we uh
sw2933B-ms98-a-0044 190.248125 196.340500 we have five children so it's been good for us to uh to have the HMO for the most part
sw2933B-ms98-a-0045 196.340500 209.391250 we're in a different one now than we used to be and it's required some adjustment but i think it in the end it will all come out in the wash their uh mental health benefits are very very low
sw2933B-ms98-a-0046 209.391250 219.616250 and anything that is elective of in any way could possibly be conceived as elective is you know not covered so
sw2933B-ms98-a-0047 219.616250 227.222875 if you have those kinds of services that while the general public may see them as elective you don't see them as elective
sw2933B-ms98-a-0048 227.222875 228.528000 then uh
sw2933B-ms98-a-0049 228.528000 229.759250 you know
sw2933B-ms98-a-0050 229.759250 234.279250 uh you know you may not get the coverage that's you might have
sw2933B-ms98-a-0051 234.279250 241.157500 [silence]
sw2933B-ms98-a-0052 241.157500 242.747500 uh-huh
sw2933B-ms98-a-0053 242.747500 245.032375 [silence]
sw2933B-ms98-a-0054 245.032375 248.278125 that's right that's right
sw2933B-ms98-a-0055 248.278125 253.164500 and i know that that is a is a concern and if those people aren't willing to
sw2933B-ms98-a-0056 253.164500 258.262750 go to outpatient you know therapy or something then that benefit is
sw2933B-ms98-a-0057 258.262750 261.966625 what what was paid is almost wasted
sw2933B-ms98-a-0058 261.966625 265.801250 and uh well i mean i guess you can't ever totally say that but
sw2933B-ms98-a-0059 265.801250 276.673500 you know the best good was not gleaned from the [laughter-money] [laughter-spent] where as maybe even two weeks longer would have made a difference there should be some provision for appeal or something i guess
sw2933B-ms98-a-0060 276.673500 278.533375 need
sw2933B-ms98-a-0061 278.533375 285.878875 [silence]
sw2933B-ms98-a-0062 285.878875 290.179500 well yes i guess so you know uh
sw2933B-ms98-a-0063 290.179500 293.842000 but not uh not really
sw2933B-ms98-a-0064 293.842000 305.415500 you know there're there are some options in in every area whether it's medical or uh you know insurance or you know as a stock you know savings
sw2933B-ms98-a-0065 305.415500 310.501625 kind of plan that's subsidized by the company and that kind of thing so
sw2933B-ms98-a-0066 310.501625 314.626000 [silence]
sw2933B-ms98-a-0067 314.626000 317.855000 um-hum yeah yeah
sw2933B-ms98-a-0068 317.855000 324.572250 yeah we have been so grateful for that over the years because we uh
sw2933B-ms98-a-0069 324.572250 330.078750 uh that that's what our kids are going to go to college on i guess so
sw2933B-ms98-a-0070 330.078750 332.538250 you know it's good that
sw2933B-ms98-a-0071 332.538250 334.015625 [silence]
sw2933B-ms98-a-0072 334.015625 341.954375 no i don't think so i think there're going to be too many of us our age for any way that that system can possibly
sw2933B-ms98-a-0073 341.954375 350.324750 even barely lessen the load we just better be those of us who can try to do something anything to put away for
sw2933B-ms98-a-0074 350.324750 354.157750 hopefully we won't have such a attitude
sw2933B-ms98-a-0075 354.157750 360.049875 in our country about elderly people not being able to work and not being smart enough to
sw2933B-ms98-a-0076 360.049875 363.335000 lend a hand by the time we get there [laughter-too]
sw2933B-ms98-a-0077 363.335000 365.816000 [silence]
sw2933B-ms98-a-0078 365.816000 367.097250 yeah

sw2933B-ms98-a-0080 368.219000 373.094250 exactly so it's going to we're going to see a lot of changes in the next while
sw2933B-ms98-a-0081 373.094250 374.284500 [silence]
sw2933B-ms98-a-0082 374.284500 377.960250 i would think so don't you think yeah
sw2933B-ms98-a-0083 377.960250 386.428125 i know uh my mother-in-law has had to get individual insurance the last couple of years and she's seventy two
sw2933B-ms98-a-0084 386.428125 394.395750 and uh it's just been so difficult to get uh you know to get anything
sw2933B-ms98-a-0085 394.395750 395.942625 but uh
sw2933B-ms98-a-0086 395.942625 397.192125 [silence]
