sw2998B-ms98-a-0002 1.033375 6.000875 [silence]
sw2998B-ms98-a-0003 6.000875 12.567750 well the the the m[ajor]- m[ajor]- major cause it seems up here is simp[ly]- i live right on the ocean so
sw2998B-ms98-a-0004 12.567750 25.661125 it's kind of hard for me to tell what would happen if i lived in some of the valleys inland but the major cause here and we always seem to and it seems to be validated by the press is the car pollution we don't have too much industrial pollution
sw2998B-ms98-a-0005 25.661125 32.374500 uh car pollution seems to be the one and only thing that that i can really put my finger on here
sw2998B-ms98-a-0006 32.374500 63.853125 [silence]
sw2998B-ms98-a-0007 63.853125 66.506375 is that so i didn't know that
sw2998B-ms98-a-0008 66.506375 68.219875 [silence]
sw2998B-ms98-a-0009 68.219875 73.646875 well most people talk about the noise pollution from airplanes rather than the air pollution
sw2998B-ms98-a-0010 73.646875 77.128500 [silence]
sw2998B-ms98-a-0011 77.128500 78.474375 yeah
sw2998B-ms98-a-0012 78.474375 79.502625 [silence]
sw2998B-ms98-a-0013 79.502625 87.749000 i would think so you know uh i- i guess it talked about all types of pollution i happen to r[ead]- just read something the other day
sw2998B-ms98-a-0014 87.749000 93.984500 at least in the Boston paper there were three things that that come to note one is that the carbon fluorides that are
sw2998B-ms98-a-0015 93.984500 107.678625 uh being released into the atmosphere are causing even a larger hole in the southern hemisphere in the ozone layer and again and now they've located another one or [vocalized-noise] rather an expanding one in the northern hemisphere so car
sw2998B-ms98-a-0016 107.678625 112.230250 so i'm quite concerned i don't think it's involved any longer with
sw2998B-ms98-a-0017 112.230250 123.773750 with uh hair sprays or those th[ose]- no i think it's now is what uh from what i understand it's air conditioning units and and we certainly turned into an air conditioned [laughter-society]
sw2998B-ms98-a-0018 123.773750 131.332000 yeah i know in Florida there's no place you go that isn't air conditioned and i do quite a bit of business in Washington [noise] and
sw2998B-ms98-a-0019 131.332000 138.454375 oh yeah it's quite is is the [vocalized-noise] it's really out of the norm not to find something that isn't air conditioned
sw2998B-ms98-a-0020 138.454375 143.196500 and and i guess refrigerators are the same way they release that
sw2998B-ms98-a-0021 143.196500 145.460625 [silence]
sw2998B-ms98-a-0022 145.460625 146.721375 yeah
sw2998B-ms98-a-0023 146.721375 148.021750 well
sw2998B-ms98-a-0024 148.021750 157.028625 [silence]
sw2998B-ms98-a-0025 157.028625 158.363125 yeah
sw2998B-ms98-a-0026 158.363125 185.689500 [silence]
sw2998B-ms98-a-0027 185.689500 188.217625 well i- i th[ink]- yeah
sw2998B-ms98-a-0028 188.217625 200.678000 no i think that it can be done simply because uh uh we've we've every car now in America that's been produced for the past fifteen years has what they call a catalytic converter
sw2998B-ms98-a-0029 200.678000 212.680500 and no lead gas was came to the pumps and and that's been done there's the lead pollution has that problem essentially i guess because it was at crisis proportions was was licked
sw2998B-ms98-a-0030 212.680500 226.379000 and i think that there are th[ere]- there are solutions certainly we don't even need a need a research anymore it's just a matter of passing the law and passing the law depends on how heavy the car industry the automobile lobby is
sw2998B-ms98-a-0031 226.379000 227.436875 [silence]
sw2998B-ms98-a-0032 227.436875 229.475125 that's right that's right
sw2998B-ms98-a-0033 229.475125 232.941625 [silence]
sw2998B-ms98-a-0034 232.941625 244.358250 oh yeah well [noise] that that the the smell is awful and but you know i was reading the other day not to go on with this but that diesel fumes actually have less pollutants in them than gasoline fumes
sw2998B-ms98-a-0035 244.358250 254.731625 so i guess you're better off [laughter-sitting] [laughter-behind] [laughter-a] [laughter-bus] than a car although i can never i could never uh really a a rationalize that while i was sitting there [laughter]
sw2998B-ms98-a-0036 254.731625 257.328500 [silence]
sw2998B-ms98-a-0037 257.328500 258.629625 yeah
sw2998B-ms98-a-0038 258.629625 262.237750 [silence]
sw2998B-ms98-a-0039 262.237750 272.949000 well we you know up here in New England uh where i've right close to where i live is the Seabrook Nucleus site which is practically a you know guerrilla war up here went on for years
sw2998B-ms98-a-0040 272.949000 283.511500 uh m[y]- my daughters marched in the uh uh against the Seabrook and i kind of uh my feelings were that we needed this bridge to to uh to [vocalized-noise]
sw2998B-ms98-a-0041 283.511500 289.175625 [vocalized-noise] jump from whatever it was going to be from fossil fuel to whatever it was going to be
sw2998B-ms98-a-0042 289.175625 294.798750 yeah un[fortunately]- u[nfortunately]- unfortunately though i think the oil companies have lied to us for [laughter-years]
sw2998B-ms98-a-0043 294.798750 301.513625 so we really don't know whether there's enough fossil fuel left or there isn't and uh and uh i
sw2998B-ms98-a-0044 301.513625 304.187625 [silence]
sw2998B-ms98-a-0045 304.187625 305.466750 no

sw2998B-ms98-a-0047 307.005375 308.363375 yeah

sw2998B-ms98-a-0051 323.054500 324.407500 yes
sw2998B-ms98-a-0052 324.407500 327.323000 [silence]
sw2998B-ms98-a-0053 327.323000 328.977250 that's right
sw2998B-ms98-a-0054 328.977250 330.225750 [silence]
sw2998B-ms98-a-0055 330.225750 332.090000 yeah
sw2998B-ms98-a-0056 332.090000 338.093000 [silence]
sw2998B-ms98-a-0057 338.093000 345.924750 well since since Texas and Louisiana and uh California that in that ranking order the worst pollutants in America
sw2998B-ms98-a-0058 345.924750 356.742875 i mean i read that the other day i mean Louisi[ana]- Louisiana for a small state w[as]- it was amazing but it's the industrial pollution i should imagine and California seems to be taking steps i mean
sw2998B-ms98-a-0059 356.742875 371.055875 you you read about the the fairly fairly stiff laws they put in on cars now they're they're enforcing but uh again uh that didn't occur without a crisis nothing will occur i guess without a crisis
sw2998B-ms98-a-0060 371.055875 374.562500 yeah exactly exactly
sw2998B-ms98-a-0061 374.562500 386.946750 well the greatest thing that happened to pollution in the last couple of years as far as i'm concerned is the no smoking rules on airplanes and in restaurants and it it really is a pleasure for me although i guess smokers don't [laughter-think] [laughter-that]
sw2998B-ms98-a-0062 386.946750 389.428250 but that to me was pollution [vocalized-noise]
sw2998B-ms98-a-0063 389.428250 394.687750 that was its most personal personal uh pollution that i can think of
sw2998B-ms98-a-0064 394.687750 397.684250 [silence]
sw2998B-ms98-a-0065 397.684250 399.362375 surely
sw2998B-ms98-a-0066 399.362375 403.750875 [vocalized-noise] something happen right on thank you bye-bye
sw2998B-ms98-a-0067 403.750875 405.944000 [noise]
