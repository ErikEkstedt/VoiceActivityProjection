sw2998A-ms98-a-0002 0.697250 6.328125 um what do you think [laughter] the major cause of air pollution or at least in the Boston areas
sw2998A-ms98-a-0003 6.328125 16.574500 [silence]
sw2998A-ms98-a-0004 16.574500 17.819500 um-hum

sw2998A-ms98-a-0006 24.969375 26.590250 yeah yeah
sw2998A-ms98-a-0007 26.590250 31.631000 [silence]
sw2998A-ms98-a-0008 31.631000 40.665000 um that isn't the same in the Washington area because we don't have any major um industry except for uh government and services
sw2998A-ms98-a-0009 40.665000 46.893000 and the the transportation situation is such that uh all the car pollution is is absolutely awful
sw2998A-ms98-a-0010 46.893000 56.093625 um [noise] also the worth of the hub of three airports in this general area there is uh National Dulles and then uh Baltimore Washington
sw2998A-ms98-a-0011 56.093625 64.639875 and it interestingly some of the information i've been reading indicates that the amount of air pollution from uh uh airplanes is extraordinary
sw2998A-ms98-a-0012 64.639875 69.026625 yeah and that's always something that you know you just don't real you don't think about
sw2998A-ms98-a-0013 69.026625 71.754875 [silence]
sw2998A-ms98-a-0014 71.754875 80.504500 uh but the uh apparently the air pollution and the fact that it's delivered right up in high altitudes is a very significant factor
sw2998A-ms98-a-0015 80.504500 84.998250 [silence]

sw2998A-ms98-a-0023 121.149500 124.743000 [laughter-society] has especially recently [laughter] 
sw2998A-ms98-a-0024 124.743000 130.064000 [silence]
sw2998A-ms98-a-0025 130.064000 132.297000 i mean you know what it's like here
sw2998A-ms98-a-0026 132.297000 137.820875 [silence]
sw2998A-ms98-a-0027 137.820875 141.218000 yeah yeah yeah we just had the
sw2998A-ms98-a-0028 141.218000 142.397750 [silence]
sw2998A-ms98-a-0029 142.397750 148.618250 that's right so solutions to this would be i- i you know improved
sw2998A-ms98-a-0030 148.618250 157.656875 well i guess the fir[st]- the to me the first thing is i wish society would get as upset about this as you do get getting people upset about animal rights
sw2998A-ms98-a-0031 157.656875 161.485750 i mean this is so so basic [laughter-it's] human rights in the sense
sw2998A-ms98-a-0032 161.485750 167.706875 but uh in terms of demanding it's just not caused but demanding that um
sw2998A-ms98-a-0033 167.706875 170.607125 uh we can spend so much money on certain things but
sw2998A-ms98-a-0034 170.607125 183.345750 that research really be directed toward um improvement of polluting vehicles and not just cars but also buses um [noise] planes
sw2998A-ms98-a-0035 183.345750 189.407500 that something can be done i me[an]- i can't imagine that well if we can't send people to the moon that we can't improve these [laughter-things]
sw2998A-ms98-a-0036 189.407500 199.463000 [silence]

sw2998A-ms98-a-0041 215.138625 217.272750 and that uh for buses 
sw2998A-ms98-a-0042 217.272750 224.642500 [silence]
sw2998A-ms98-a-0043 224.642500 228.221500 that's right well and also to make it economically feasible
sw2998A-ms98-a-0044 228.221500 233.924375 uh and par[ticular]- also in buses i don't know if you ever got caught in a traffic jam behind a bus
sw2998A-ms98-a-0045 233.924375 235.851000 that you know
sw2998A-ms98-a-0046 235.851000 238.521875 [silence]

sw2998A-ms98-a-0051 253.647000 258.089000 yeah but even of course in the longer term just to get away from fossil fuels
sw2998A-ms98-a-0052 258.089000 265.358875 i mean i'm i'm thinking of research in that direction rather than we we've taken the intermediate step but i don't think fossil fuels are the answer
sw2998A-ms98-a-0053 265.358875 268.143125 [silence]
sw2998A-ms98-a-0054 268.143125 269.442500 um-hum

sw2998A-ms98-a-0062 287.540875 292.314500 yeah you don't throw the baby out with the bath water and condemning nuclear use
sw2998A-ms98-a-0063 292.314500 294.401875 [silence]
sw2998A-ms98-a-0064 294.401875 296.054750 yeah yeah
sw2998A-ms98-a-0065 296.054750 300.020125 [silence]
sw2998A-ms98-a-0066 300.020125 304.985875 but with the pollution issue uh fossil fuel is not the way to go anyway
sw2998A-ms98-a-0067 304.985875 317.260750 uh so you've to loo[k]- you've got to look elsewhere so uh but it is something that's a little frightening and in fact well i within our family we have s[aid]- said my husband i have two sons uh well one one is already in college in New England
sw2998A-ms98-a-0068 317.260750 323.892125 and the other will be going in September and we just feel that when we leave uh this area w[e're]- we're going north not south [laughter]
sw2998A-ms98-a-0069 323.892125 328.700875 uh i like the mentality north and i also like the fresher air up there
sw2998A-ms98-a-0070 328.700875 331.227000 so i mean that's the way we will be going
sw2998A-ms98-a-0071 331.227000 339.479250 but um so i- i i'd be interested in having spoken with somebody also from the far west on this issue to see how they their attitudes are
sw2998A-ms98-a-0072 339.479250 345.265000 [silence]

sw2998A-ms98-a-0081 368.738125 375.032125 i mean even California was notorious for its smog years ago before it even was an issue out here
