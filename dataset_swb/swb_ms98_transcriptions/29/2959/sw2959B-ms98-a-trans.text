sw2959B-ms98-a-0015 45.339000 54.121250 um-hum well i've talked with a number of Vietnam veterans and i really i had no one directly related to me involved
sw2959B-ms98-a-0016 54.121250 65.355625 but uh my sister's husband was in Vietnam and it it really made a completely different man out of him he went to Vietnam one man and came back another not better
sw2959B-ms98-a-0017 65.355625 76.941125 then uh another friend of mine went and he was in combat but he came back and he said okay that's it that is behind me i am going on with my life much like what Roger Staubach did
sw2959B-ms98-a-0018 76.941125 81.811875 he was uh he was a Vietnam war veteran and uh
sw2959B-ms98-a-0019 81.811875 84.304125 yeah that's true
sw2959B-ms98-a-0020 84.304125 95.582875 right and but uh most of the folks that i have met that were actually on the land or in combat are still still carry a lot of anger
sw2959B-ms98-a-0021 95.582875 107.563125 they really do and uh i- i- i- i really do not think that we did those young men right i think that uh Desert Storm shows a lot of learning since that time

sw2959B-ms98-a-0032 138.485500 143.210500 well you know one of the most troublesome things that i have
sw2959B-ms98-a-0033 143.210500 157.966250 encountered as a result is the incredible influx of southeast Asians into this country since that conflict uh not so much that i say i do not want you here but there is just such a surge
sw2959B-ms98-a-0034 157.966250 165.297750 of southeast Asians it has affected the culture of this country uh very much
sw2959B-ms98-a-0035 165.297750 174.746125 yeah yeah yeah well uh the culture's changing look how much more oriental food we have restaurants now for example
sw2959B-ms98-a-0036 174.746125 175.995250 uh
sw2959B-ms98-a-0037 175.995250 178.052875 even ten years ago
sw2959B-ms98-a-0038 178.052875 184.310375 there weren't that many a lot of shops are are operated by uh southeast Asians 
sw2959B-ms98-a-0039 184.310375 192.823250 lot of people have complained in the schools there is a culture change there the southeast Asians seem to be very hungry there seem to be very studious 
sw2959B-ms98-a-0040 192.823250 204.488375 and uh tends to cause our kids to really have to buckle down to keep up with them which is not bad not really uh but it might in the long run you can see where
sw2959B-ms98-a-0041 204.488375 210.740000 scholarships for example uh even jobs
sw2959B-ms98-a-0042 210.740000 218.125000 uh jobs that would normally go to an American with a lesser education
sw2959B-ms98-a-0043 218.125000 228.511250 might be going to to some of these people here and that is all a result of of of Vietnam and and you see a lot of a lot of men that were over there brought families back
sw2959B-ms98-a-0044 228.511250 239.641000 uh and it concerns me that there is probably a lot of mixed breed youngsters still there and i'd be concerned or interested to find out how they are doing now

sw2959B-ms98-a-0066 318.276375 326.797750 you know there is incredible cover in Vietnam and you can't find much cover on [laughter] in a sand dune [laughter]

sw2959B-ms98-a-0079 368.004625 371.137000 don't you think they learned from the mistakes in Vietnam
sw2959B-ms98-a-0080 371.137000 373.987875 part of it's that part of it's technology but

sw2959B-ms98-a-0082 375.188125 377.206375 but when when
sw2959B-ms98-a-0083 377.206375 389.999250 when you get into trouble like that in a place like Vietnam you do tend to analyze the problems that you get into and you say never more and and you overcome those problems and you are prepared next time

sw2959B-ms98-a-0090 413.979875 422.736750 was one of the finest assets that we lost we didn't actually physically lose them they did not lose their lives but they lost a whole lot of the life they might have had
sw2959B-ms98-a-0091 422.736750 434.780750 uh being entirely different people i had dinner Monday night with a Vietnam veteran who is just now beginning to recover from the drug and alcohol struggle that he had
sw2959B-ms98-a-0092 434.780750 438.983000 that's a long time to suffer

sw2959B-ms98-a-0104 485.464750 488.744625 and i can't blame them_1 i don't know a solution
sw2959B-ms98-a-0105 488.744625 498.984375 but i sure can't blame them for being angry on the other hand you know you can be angry about something for a very long time or you can say well that is the way it is and go on with your life
sw2959B-ms98-a-0106 498.984375 500.974625 uh
sw2959B-ms98-a-0107 500.974625 507.795750 for the most part i wish that it hadn't happened but it did so

sw2959B-ms98-a-0113 526.989375 540.267625 well it has been that way for a very very long time though i can remember when i was in the sixth grade and that was many years ago we were reading about the French struggling with that in southeast Asia
sw2959B-ms98-a-0114 540.267625 551.974500 so and and and the Asians historically have always had these kinds of wars going on there there has not been a lot of peace in that part of the world
sw2959B-ms98-a-0115 551.974500 563.499625 i really i don't know i[t]- we should not have maybe gotten involved but if we did we certainly should have supported our people who were there more so supported them_1 when they got home
sw2959B-ms98-a-0116 563.499625 569.227875 and uh i am afraid that they were treated as castaways for the most part
sw2959B-ms98-a-0117 569.227875 577.987875 and i- i saw the movie Born On The Fourth Of July and i think it did a good job depicting the temperament of the times
