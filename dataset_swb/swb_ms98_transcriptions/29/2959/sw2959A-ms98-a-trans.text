sw2959A-ms98-a-0033 124.353375 134.414000 uh you know how they treat the war casualties you know if you come back and your leg's blown off you know or or it is hanging by a thread they still can't put it back together now but
sw2959A-ms98-a-0034 134.414000 139.498625 but what they do afterwards and how they re[habilitate]- rehabilitate you

sw2959A-ms98-a-0054 239.757625 253.490625 well they are probably not doing very well at all because_1 i know there's there's still people even in the Dallas area there are there are still people trying to get some member of their family back from uh Vietnam
sw2959A-ms98-a-0055 253.490625 254.746125 [silence]
sw2959A-ms98-a-0056 254.746125 260.187500 um uh na[tive]- native Vietnamese people
sw2959A-ms98-a-0057 260.187500 266.312250 yeah they were lost you know when they were little and and they c[ould]- never did get back or

sw2959A-ms98-a-0059 268.792625 270.241750 yeah
sw2959A-ms98-a-0060 270.241750 282.874625 and uh and uh that's is really a big waste because they didn't they didn't win they didn't regain any of the land that they had it spilled over into uh now i can't even think of the country but
sw2959A-ms98-a-0061 282.874625 287.767875 yeah Cambodia [noise] and to Laos and
sw2959A-ms98-a-0062 287.767875 297.012750 and all they did is run and hide and they weren't really fighting you know it it would've been the same as Desert Storm if all they had been fighting was North Vietnam
sw2959A-ms98-a-0063 297.012750 305.773125 but and i am not even sure who was involved more whether it was China or Russia you know they were pouring they were pouring weapons in there and
sw2959A-ms98-a-0064 305.773125 312.265125 and advising well digging tunnels for them_1 you know and there is no way that they could ever catch them_1
sw2959A-ms98-a-0065 312.265125 317.680125 [silence]
sw2959A-ms98-a-0066 317.680125 319.208375 yeah that is right

sw2959A-ms98-a-0070 324.520875 330.991000 yeah yeah and all they can do is dig in and they you know and then they try to camouflage the top
sw2959A-ms98-a-0071 330.991000 336.332250 well now even i think even now in in Vietnam they could probably have done a better job
sw2959A-ms98-a-0072 336.332250 348.762875 because they could [noise] they could kill all those plants you know which would devastate the country as far as farming from then on but and the and the Corps of Engineers i think do a better job now like they did in Desert Storm
sw2959A-ms98-a-0073 348.762875 359.081625 because they had he he dug a bunch of moats and filled them with oil and he set a lot of booby traps all along the way as they went and they had to you know they had to blow them up or
sw2959A-ms98-a-0074 359.081625 365.644875 or disarm them_1 and then they had to fill in little bridges all the way where he where he'd made those moats

sw2959A-ms98-a-0078 370.576750 377.680750 we[ll]- yeah partially uh-huh yeah part of it is technology yeah because all go ahead

sw2959A-ms98-a-0082 388.991750 396.142875 i think that's one of the reasons that they've they've pretty much avoided getting involved in South America because
sw2959A-ms98-a-0083 396.142875 404.802000 look what happened when they were looking for Noriega and they lost him for four hours when they were right on top of him you know he probably just went down into a tunnel
sw2959A-ms98-a-0084 404.802000 421.836250 [silence]
sw2959A-ms98-a-0085 421.836250 423.496875 yeah that is right

sw2959A-ms98-a-0089 438.790500 450.497875 yeah and they they really need everybody that's that's stood there it's when i[n]- in Vietnam i think it was much closer contact you stand there with a rifle and blow a a piece of somebody apart
sw2959A-ms98-a-0090 450.497875 462.282125 or blow their head off and that has to affect you if you are human you know so they had to work all that that anger out and the and the nightmares that come along with it
sw2959A-ms98-a-0091 462.282125 473.662500 i don't i do not really think that anybody can ever for[get]- forget that but they can they can reason and and try to adjust to to why they were there

sw2959A-ms98-a-0099 504.962500 517.691125 yeah and that and that was that was in the in the era when Kennedy was president that they were afraid of everything you know and and and they f[ought]- initially got into it because of Eisenhower
sw2959A-ms98-a-0100 517.691125 527.478500 and he just he didn't want to be in it any more than than what we started out in August with Desert Storm and then it just blew up into the war
