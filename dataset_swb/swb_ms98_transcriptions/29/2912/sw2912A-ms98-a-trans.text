sw2912A-ms98-a-0003 5.096125 6.701125 and uh
sw2912A-ms98-a-0004 6.701125 20.053000 that's probably true it it's a small pickup truck though it's one of those Isuzu uh space cab types with a sunroof so it's actually not a real pickup truck you know it's uh it's got nice bucket seats so it's very comfortable and uh
sw2912A-ms98-a-0005 20.053000 28.284875 it has uh with the space cab in the back i can carry some storage but i have to admit Fred i i've never had a gun rack back there so i probably wouldn't fit in Texas
sw2912A-ms98-a-0006 28.284875 33.335250 [silence]
sw2912A-ms98-a-0007 33.335250 39.067875 n[o]- no [laughter] no no nothing like that it my it's pretty pretty i think uh
sw2912A-ms98-a-0008 39.067875 48.958125 my truck sort of puts me as a uh a[s]- as a Baltimore Baltimore suburbanite i think is more uh you know i uh when i bought the truck i was going to buy a boat
sw2912A-ms98-a-0009 48.958125 61.966750 and i needed something that would be able to haul a small boat but then i i um i because_1 i wanted to try water skiing and enjoying some water sports and things and that's one reason why i bought it but then right after i bought the truck i broke my foot
sw2912A-ms98-a-0010 61.966750 70.247125 and i and the doctor said because of the type of physical therapy i got no sideward movement you know for a couple of months and that meant the whole
sw2912A-ms98-a-0011 70.247125 81.401625 s[eason]- uh water skiing you know uh season was over so i thought well okay and then by the the next year i was thinking about doing it again but i invested the money in a house
sw2912A-ms98-a-0012 81.401625 83.029500 you know so
sw2912A-ms98-a-0013 83.029500 94.208125 little more sound investment yes so so then i still have this pickup truck and then i think well now maybe i'll you know go by the boat again and of course then i broke my foot again uh so the th[ought]-
sw2912A-ms98-a-0014 94.208125 95.302250 [silence]
sw2912A-ms98-a-0015 95.302250 99.249000 [laughter] yeah that so that's so i'm not ever going going to own a boat
sw2912A-ms98-a-0016 99.249000 100.817250 yeah
sw2912A-ms98-a-0017 100.817250 110.091000 oh yeah i love my truck in fact uh well my wife and i contemplate selling both of us owned pickup trucks actually when we got married so we and now we're a two pickup truck family 
sw2912A-ms98-a-0018 110.091000 121.459000 uh hers i[n]- in some ways is is a little more convenient and then mine's convenient other ways so it's hard to decide she has a a cap on the back and and uh she has um
sw2912A-ms98-a-0019 121.459000 132.915625 uh roof racks so we were able to carry things on the roof and able to put things in the back of her truck without them ever worrying about them_1 them getting wet or whatever
sw2912A-ms98-a-0020 132.915625 139.768250 but with mine see i have a space cab so you can put like luggage immediately behind the seats and i also have bucket seats
sw2912A-ms98-a-0021 139.768250 148.333250 and air conditioning [laughter] so each one has its good points and each one has its bad points in a two truck family yeah uh what
sw2912A-ms98-a-0022 148.333250 153.099125 [silence]
sw2912A-ms98-a-0023 153.099125 164.560000 i think family um i do a little bit but surprisingly i have uh two of my brothers since i bought my Isuzu pickup two of my brothers have bought uh Isuzu Troopers
sw2912A-ms98-a-0024 164.560000 173.432250 which actually you know can open the back and just take out your backseat and you can haul washers and dryers and almost anything in them so i think um i used to be
sw2912A-ms98-a-0025 173.432250 181.881000 the one that was called but now everybody owns one themselves you know i do have some friends every once in a while that'll ask me and i'll i'll of course do that you know that doesn't matter
sw2912A-ms98-a-0026 181.881000 185.372500 yeah it's fo[r]- for a friend you'd do it anyway so it doesn't really matter

sw2912A-ms98-a-0083 362.698625 364.478000 [laughter]
sw2912A-ms98-a-0084 364.478000 370.701500 because if you had if you had kids you wouldn't say anything about sportier looking you'd be saying things like it has a good backseat
sw2912A-ms98-a-0085 370.701500 379.622000 uh the car seat fits in very easily and we can seat belt it in securely it's that's that's a big difference in conversations there [laughter] yeah
sw2912A-ms98-a-0086 379.622000 382.778125 no we well we're uh just recently married in December
sw2912A-ms98-a-0087 382.778125 387.744500 uh but that's we we laugh now my wife says we should sell my truck and i say we should sell hers
sw2912A-ms98-a-0088 387.744500 399.004000 and i said well the reason why we should sell yours Laura is because_1 see mine has the space cab and it actually has little drop seats in the space area with seat belts i said and we can seat buckle in a car seat there
sw2912A-ms98-a-0089 399.004000 410.171875 so we should get rid of yours because the three of us won't be able to go on trips i said but we can go on trips in mine you know we can travel anywhere with my truck so that's uh you know we l[augh]- i laugh about that um-hum
sw2912A-ms98-a-0090 410.171875 411.715750 [silence]

sw2912A-ms98-a-0096 424.002375 428.466625 [silence]
sw2912A-ms98-a-0097 428.466625 442.152875 yeah i think uh i think Ford was one of the first ones to step into that new um that new almost shuttle space shuttle like appearance and i think they've done they've really come on strong with some of that um
sw2912A-ms98-a-0098 442.152875 452.613500 uh wind resistance and energy saving and uh uh developments i think that that's their station wagon i think those are Fords but i do i like those
sw2912A-ms98-a-0099 452.613500 454.451250 [silence]
sw2912A-ms98-a-0100 454.451250 460.206125 [laughter-yeah] yeah now now the station wagon looks sleek it looks yeah
sw2912A-ms98-a-0101 460.206125 474.293625 and uh and hopefully i think uh you know it's supposed to get better gas mileage and um i think that's that's becoming an important thing too my wife and i've been discussing is you know looking for a car when we do get rid of one of the trucks we'll probably look for a car that gets good gas mileage
sw2912A-ms98-a-0102 474.293625 476.585500 just because um
sw2912A-ms98-a-0103 476.585500 485.119625 it it just has become such an important thing i think for the environment and for the economy and everything you know to start to pay attention to that more and more
sw2912A-ms98-a-0104 485.119625 490.204750 [silence]
sw2912A-ms98-a-0105 490.204750 498.662750 no i think i think the reason why i i bought the Isuzu is because you know i looked almost all the small trucks are made by Japanese anyway
sw2912A-ms98-a-0106 498.662750 512.859000 there's only a couple of them_1 like i looked the first place i went were the were Dodge Chrysler Plymouth and you know i went to a number of them and i priced them_1 all out and i was just the the i was almost going to buy a um a Chrysler which was actually a Mitsubishi truck
sw2912A-ms98-a-0107 512.859000 525.160875 but the salesman insulted me um the guy the salesman you know they always do that deal with you where they say well i got to go talk to my manager well here the manager's actually the guy that owns the place and in this small town we live on he's always on TV
sw2912A-ms98-a-0108 525.160875 532.838875 and he comes out of his office and i asked him for i- i i said well you know it was like maybe eighty three hundred dollars for this truck
sw2912A-ms98-a-0109 532.838875 543.186000 and i said well i i'd like it for eight thousand dollars i said for eight thousand dollars i'll s[ell]- you know i'll write out the down payment now and you know because_1 i can get f[inancing]- i can get financing through my credit
sw2912A-ms98-a-0110 543.186000 553.105625 because_1 i'd checked about financing and everything you know i said i'll for eight thousand dollars i'll take it you know because_1 it was oh sort of marked down you know and the and the guy came out of the back and insulted me he said
sw2912A-ms98-a-0111 553.105625 558.277875 he said you want a truck for under eight thousand dollars go back to the used lot it's behind the building and he walked away
sw2912A-ms98-a-0112 558.277875 571.294875 i guess it was a sales technique he thought he was going to pressure me into giving up that three hundred dollars that i asked for i don't know and i said i said i looked at the salesman i said i'm i'm sorry your boss just insulted me i can't it's against my pride to buy a truck here now
sw2912A-ms98-a-0113 571.294875 574.402125 and g[uy]- and i felt really bad i walked out and the guy
sw2912A-ms98-a-0114 574.402125 583.470875 called me at home the next couple of days it was terrible but you know i walked out i got in to my brother was actually with me shopping for a car and we drove down the street 
sw2912A-ms98-a-0115 583.470875 592.691750 and he said why don't you just look in here and we went into the Isuzu dealer because_1 my brother always had this love for an Isuzu Trooper he wanted one you know
sw2912A-ms98-a-0116 592.691750 599.941250 and we walked in and here there was a demonstrator model on sale like ninety six hundred dollars with everything sta[ndard]-
