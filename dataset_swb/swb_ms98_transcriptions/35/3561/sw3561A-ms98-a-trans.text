sw3561A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.306000 [noise] and
sw3561A-ms98-a-0002 1.306000 4.469375 i mean short term i don't think anything's gonna be done about it
sw3561A-ms98-a-0003 4.469375 6.299750 or probably should be done about it
sw3561A-ms98-a-0004 6.299750 9.319500 [silence]
sw3561A-ms98-a-0005 9.319500 14.209375 uh the short term the recession is getting getting top attention
sw3561A-ms98-a-0006 14.209375 26.991000 [silence]
sw3561A-ms98-a-0007 26.991000 30.896250 and that effectively adds to it whether it's officially on the books or not
sw3561A-ms98-a-0008 30.896250 33.169625 [silence]
sw3561A-ms98-a-0009 33.169625 35.064000 and that's got to be paid
sw3561A-ms98-a-0010 35.064000 67.624375 [silence]
sw3561A-ms98-a-0011 67.624375 69.782250 it can only hurt the deficit picture
sw3561A-ms98-a-0012 69.782250 71.423625 um
sw3561A-ms98-a-0013 71.423625 76.133500 and the the severity of the deficit picture already
sw3561A-ms98-a-0014 76.133500 77.834625 limits
sw3561A-ms98-a-0015 77.834625 87.026750 the options available or limits the degree of tax cutting you can do without uh bringing on on serious problems for the longer term
sw3561A-ms98-a-0016 87.026750 89.625250 so that that that's the current predicament
sw3561A-ms98-a-0017 89.625250 145.142250 [silence]
sw3561A-ms98-a-0018 145.142250 146.372625 [noise]
sw3561A-ms98-a-0019 146.372625 147.381625 [silence]
sw3561A-ms98-a-0020 147.381625 149.581250 yeah i'm not sure how i feel about
sw3561A-ms98-a-0021 149.581250 151.724500 tagging them_1 to share the cost of
sw3561A-ms98-a-0022 151.724500 157.986625 yeah th[e]- the long term quests that tax cuts are worth at this point it's partly a judgment of how bad the recession is
sw3561A-ms98-a-0023 157.986625 163.123250 [silence]
sw3561A-ms98-a-0024 163.123250 169.011250 well look first of all you look to the fed to fight the recession as indeed it has with interest rates
sw3561A-ms98-a-0025 169.011250 171.837875 [silence]
sw3561A-ms98-a-0026 171.837875 172.899625 um-hum
sw3561A-ms98-a-0027 172.899625 176.360625 [silence]
sw3561A-ms98-a-0028 176.360625 179.609375 well at the moment we're doing very well on inflation
sw3561A-ms98-a-0029 179.609375 185.043125 that's the sort of upside to the deficit th[at's]- that's the upside to the recession
sw3561A-ms98-a-0030 185.043125 189.969875 [silence]
sw3561A-ms98-a-0031 189.969875 196.802125 [noise] and the longer well can be done or will be done are two different things um
sw3561A-ms98-a-0032 196.802125 205.374125 at various places to look for for cutting the budget first of all i consider more defense cuts than are already planned
sw3561A-ms98-a-0033 205.374125 207.703000 depending on the world situation
sw3561A-ms98-a-0034 207.703000 219.989875 but there are various other areas such as as farm subsidies that ought to be slashed ah a lot of entitlement programs like education aid i think ah
sw3561A-ms98-a-0035 219.989875 221.604875 [silence]
sw3561A-ms98-a-0036 221.604875 231.054875 they should've put a in the Reagan administrations took took took [vocalized-noise] layoff such entitlements to the to the poor but left them_1 for the middle class
sw3561A-ms98-a-0037 231.054875 244.338625 ah in the longer term ah we we we'd do well i think to make to make uh reductions there also somewhat related [vocalized-noise] is to collect money that's owed to the government from various loan programs that people have borrowed
sw3561A-ms98-a-0038 244.338625 257.482625 [silence]
sw3561A-ms98-a-0039 257.482625 262.381875 a lot of the education aid has gone to so called trade schools
sw3561A-ms98-a-0040 262.381875 265.574000 which are so there not colleges but schools that
sw3561A-ms98-a-0041 265.574000 275.754500 teach you trades you know beauticians whatever at more and often exists only because of the federal programs that they can take people and tell them they can get loans for their full tuition
sw3561A-ms98-a-0042 275.754500 282.020375 ah and the school gets paid off immediately ah they don't provide very much education and uh
sw3561A-ms98-a-0043 282.020375 283.328000 yes
sw3561A-ms98-a-0044 283.328000 297.718125 [silence]
