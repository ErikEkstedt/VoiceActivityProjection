sw3561B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.610500 [noise]
sw3561B-ms98-a-0002 0.610500 2.354500 all right well
sw3561B-ms98-a-0003 2.354500 4.278625 [silence]
sw3561B-ms98-a-0004 4.278625 5.683500 well i
sw3561B-ms98-a-0005 5.683500 9.971875 uh are you saying you didn't think anything should be done in the short term
sw3561B-ms98-a-0006 9.971875 14.432000 [silence]
sw3561B-ms98-a-0007 14.432000 19.839125 yeah well i i think that you're absolutely right there the other thing is is that we've got these um
sw3561B-ms98-a-0008 19.839125 26.359750 these all these bank defaults going on and and savings and loan defaults and and uh
sw3561B-ms98-a-0009 26.359750 27.593375 uh
sw3561B-ms98-a-0010 27.593375 30.370875 [silence]
sw3561B-ms98-a-0011 30.370875 32.671125 right exactly
sw3561B-ms98-a-0012 32.671125 34.308625 um
sw3561B-ms98-a-0013 34.308625 45.189000 exactly and and uh so this creates a pretty serious problem that's going to continue to be with us for a while to come um i'm not really
sw3561B-ms98-a-0014 45.189000 55.969500 uh sure that i even understand why the administration is proposing for instance tax reductions because it seems to me that if if if they're talking about reducing
sw3561B-ms98-a-0015 55.969500 68.848375 uh the tax that needs to be paid or the t[axes]- taxes currently being paid then that can't it seems to me it can't possibly [vocalized-noise] you know help with the the deficit picture
sw3561B-ms98-a-0016 68.848375 70.887875 yeah exactly
sw3561B-ms98-a-0017 70.887875 86.606625 [silence]
sw3561B-ms98-a-0018 86.606625 88.246875 yeah exactly
sw3561B-ms98-a-0019 88.246875 89.503250 [silence]
sw3561B-ms98-a-0020 89.503250 94.852750 yeah it see[ms]- seems like it's it's a kind of a catch twenty two i mean it's it's the um
sw3561B-ms98-a-0021 94.852750 103.073375 my understanding is what they're trying t[o]- what what supposedly they're trying to do by reducing taxes is to kind of jump start the economy the idea being that
sw3561B-ms98-a-0022 103.073375 114.481125 if people have to pay less money in taxes they'll have more money to spend uh and if they have more money to spend then that will be a a spur to productivity particularly commercial productivity
sw3561B-ms98-a-0023 114.481125 119.873375 uh which in turn will generate revenue but it it seems like like uh
sw3561B-ms98-a-0024 119.873375 130.628125 it's sort of a uh a sp[iral]- an unending spiral and it it uh i'm i'm not sure that there's any real genuine truth to the uh the idea that that uh
sw3561B-ms98-a-0025 130.628125 141.114375 that decreasing taxes particularly the kinds that are are being recommended by by the Bush administration and things like capital gains taxes and so forth is going to uh result
sw3561B-ms98-a-0026 141.114375 146.207625 in substantial amounts of money you know for consumers to spend
sw3561B-ms98-a-0027 146.207625 147.749500 and uh
sw3561B-ms98-a-0028 147.749500 157.107125 [silence]
sw3561B-ms98-a-0029 157.107125 164.094500 yeah it uh it would seem to me th[at]- that there are other things that the administration could do
sw3561B-ms98-a-0030 164.094500 166.117000 [silence]
sw3561B-ms98-a-0031 166.117000 167.411750 um-hum
sw3561B-ms98-a-0032 167.411750 168.427000 [silence]
sw3561B-ms98-a-0033 168.427000 175.331500 um-hum i think that's been a positive development i think what that's done is it's it's it's helped keep inflation from
sw3561B-ms98-a-0034 175.331500 177.498375 um uh
sw3561B-ms98-a-0035 177.498375 178.813875 [silence]
sw3561B-ms98-a-0036 178.813875 182.996125 yeah exactly and it's a sort of a piece of luck
sw3561B-ms98-a-0037 182.996125 184.404625 [silence]
sw3561B-ms98-a-0038 184.404625 186.950750 yeah um
sw3561B-ms98-a-0039 186.950750 192.383125 [noise] i don't know what kind of things do you think can be done in in uh in the long term
sw3561B-ms98-a-0040 192.383125 204.919625 [silence]
sw3561B-ms98-a-0041 204.919625 206.222500 sure
sw3561B-ms98-a-0042 206.222500 228.188000 [silence]
sw3561B-ms98-a-0043 228.188000 229.485500 um-hum
sw3561B-ms98-a-0044 229.485500 244.096000 [silence]
sw3561B-ms98-a-0045 244.096000 249.897125 right i think that i i think that that i agree with you certainly in the second
sw3561B-ms98-a-0046 249.897125 258.557125 situation and i think certain entitlements i i'm inclined to agree with you too education happens to be one place where i think that we would be foolish to um uh 
sw3561B-ms98-a-0047 258.557125 261.838625 [silence]
sw3561B-ms98-a-0048 261.838625 263.119250 uh-huh
sw3561B-ms98-a-0049 263.119250 267.168250 [silence]
sw3561B-ms98-a-0050 267.168250 269.527375 oh i see what you['re]- i see what you're saying
sw3561B-ms98-a-0051 269.527375 278.992625 [silence]
sw3561B-ms98-a-0052 278.992625 280.387625 and then the
sw3561B-ms98-a-0053 280.387625 281.396625 [silence]
sw3561B-ms98-a-0054 281.396625 283.878500 and then the people default on the loans
sw3561B-ms98-a-0055 283.878500 288.831000 well i i would have to agree with you if there are circumstances like that uh around
sw3561B-ms98-a-0056 288.831000 298.562000 uh and i i i can't confess to having any substantial knowledge of that sort of thing but but but taking what you're saying at face value then i would have to agree with you completely
