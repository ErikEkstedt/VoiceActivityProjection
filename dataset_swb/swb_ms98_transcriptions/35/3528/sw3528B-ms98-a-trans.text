sw3528B-ms98-a-0002 0.036750 1.514875 good thank you
sw3528B-ms98-a-0003 1.514875 3.548250 [silence]
sw3528B-ms98-a-0004 3.548250 5.495250 yes
sw3528B-ms98-a-0005 5.495250 15.753375 [laughter-well] i just got through renti[ng]- reading uh Space by uh James Michener and so that uh helped out a little bit i think
sw3528B-ms98-a-0006 15.753375 19.226375 [silence]
sw3528B-ms98-a-0007 19.226375 22.987625 well he tends to go into a lot of detail sometimes
sw3528B-ms98-a-0008 22.987625 26.434000 [silence]
sw3528B-ms98-a-0009 26.434000 28.493375 oh is that right
sw3528B-ms98-a-0010 28.493375 31.491625 [silence]
sw3528B-ms98-a-0011 31.491625 42.715875 well [noise] uh [noise] i'm not sure to be honest with you so uh this going to the moon seemed to be a exciting adventure and uh
sw3528B-ms98-a-0012 42.715875 55.223000 it wasn't yeah it was nice to go there but i don't know that it really benefited mankind that much [noise] i happen to live not too far away from uh [noise] well i've actually worked for the company that uh
sw3528B-ms98-a-0013 55.223000 59.725000 has been blamed for the Challenger disaster um M[orton]- Morton Thiakol
sw3528B-ms98-a-0014 59.725000 69.265125 [noise] and uh you know that's been kind of a a real negative feeling here is sure it was a you know very unfortunate thing that occurred there and it's
sw3528B-ms98-a-0015 69.265125 72.375375 uh we live in uh Utah
sw3528B-ms98-a-0016 72.375375 73.447250 [silence]
sw3528B-ms98-a-0017 73.447250 85.753625 uh-huh yeah uh oh i have a sister that lives in Dallas that's how we got hooked up to the program was her her husband works for Penney's there so
sw3528B-ms98-a-0018 85.753625 87.031750 [silence]
sw3528B-ms98-a-0019 87.031750 88.904750 pardon me
sw3528B-ms98-a-0020 88.904750 97.257500 [noise] no her name is uh my last name is Skidmore and her her husband's name is his last name is Wade yeah
sw3528B-ms98-a-0021 97.257500 101.706375 [silence]
sw3528B-ms98-a-0022 101.706375 112.610750 [noise] well they were there was um [noise] apparently the specifications for the joints uh they were not to perform in uh cold weather
sw3528B-ms98-a-0023 112.610750 121.655375 and uh apparently there was definitely a a joint that did not seal and uh if you've ever seen the size of those uh motors
sw3528B-ms98-a-0024 121.655375 133.263500 that put into space i mean they're as long as a football field practically [laughter-and] about twelve foot in diameter and and it's a lot of pressure a lot of thrust to get that much weight up in the air
sw3528B-ms98-a-0025 133.263500 146.315875 so it's [noise] this book was interesting though uh uh [noise] talked about how a lot of the problems they have to come overcome to uh it's a very [noise] complex uh situation to go into space
sw3528B-ms98-a-0026 146.315875 157.163375 [noise] they w[ent]- w[ent]- the thing [noise] that he went into quite a bit of detail about how how much of a problem it is to reenter the Earth's atmosphere and [noise] yeah
sw3528B-ms98-a-0027 157.163375 171.745750 [laughter-yeah] but they have to come in at a just the right angle if you come in at the wrong angle what happens is they bounce off and go back into space and if they come into it at a different angle there's so much friction that it burns them_1 up so
sw3528B-ms98-a-0028 171.745750 174.534000 [silence]
sw3528B-ms98-a-0029 174.534000 176.147500 oh
sw3528B-ms98-a-0030 176.147500 178.192875 uh-huh
sw3528B-ms98-a-0031 178.192875 180.106000 yeah
sw3528B-ms98-a-0032 180.106000 185.736875 [silence]
sw3528B-ms98-a-0033 185.736875 187.597125 yeah i've i-
sw3528B-ms98-a-0034 187.597125 194.746000 i would say i've never i've never seen an actual capsule i've seen more o[f]- more of the motors that tha[t]- they produced out there
sw3528B-ms98-a-0035 194.746000 195.946875 [silence]
sw3528B-ms98-a-0036 195.946875 198.826750 uh-huh yeah
sw3528B-ms98-a-0037 198.826750 200.035250 [silence]
sw3528B-ms98-a-0038 200.035250 204.773000 people have commented how uh they were surprised at how small they were
sw3528B-ms98-a-0039 204.773000 207.255875 looked pretty confining huh
sw3528B-ms98-a-0040 207.255875 213.340000 [silence]
sw3528B-ms98-a-0041 213.340000 215.004625 is that right
sw3528B-ms98-a-0042 215.004625 216.497500 [silence]
sw3528B-ms98-a-0043 216.497500 218.544375 huh
sw3528B-ms98-a-0044 218.544375 223.264625 [silence]
sw3528B-ms98-a-0045 223.264625 234.892000 not really um [noise] one thing i know one thing they've they've mentioned that i didn't get from the book by the way but they've talked about uh
sw3528B-ms98-a-0046 234.892000 239.426625 they're able to manufacture uh different kinds of crystals
sw3528B-ms98-a-0047 239.426625 249.238125 and ball bearings and things like that in a zero gravity state that they turned out being almost uh nearly perfect as far as a ball bearing goes it's perfectly round
sw3528B-ms98-a-0048 249.238125 253.574250 but i'm not sure you have to go to outer space to achieve that zero gravity
sw3528B-ms98-a-0049 253.574250 256.548375 yeah [laughter-so]
sw3528B-ms98-a-0050 256.548375 263.855250 [silence]
sw3528B-ms98-a-0051 263.855250 265.286375 uh-huh
sw3528B-ms98-a-0052 265.286375 269.593625 [silence]
sw3528B-ms98-a-0053 269.593625 271.016750 yes
sw3528B-ms98-a-0054 271.016750 277.234125 [silence]
sw3528B-ms98-a-0055 277.234125 286.211250 [noise] uh i think they have cut it back to be honest with you from from the glory days when they [vocalized-noise] did the Apollo shots and the moon uh
sw3528B-ms98-a-0056 286.211250 294.719250 [noise] i appreciate having the satellites you know that's certainly made it nice for other purpose i don't know if you have a satellite dish or not we don't but i
sw3528B-ms98-a-0057 294.719250 299.778000 i know that's certainly helped a lot [noise] in that regard uh
