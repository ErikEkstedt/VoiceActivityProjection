sw3573A-ms98-a-0012 74.666000 79.290875 [silence]
sw3573A-ms98-a-0013 79.290875 87.143875 well that's very interesting i've had i've had exactly the same experience with the one that i've got it's a and surprisingly it's also an eighty four
sw3573A-ms98-a-0014 87.143875 88.244250 [noise]
sw3573A-ms98-a-0015 88.244250 90.101750 and um
sw3573A-ms98-a-0016 90.101750 92.269625 [noise] yeah i'm still there
sw3573A-ms98-a-0017 92.269625 94.037250 um i'm sorry what
sw3573A-ms98-a-0018 94.037250 98.450500 yes it's an LX it's not a hatchback but it's um it's uh
sw3573A-ms98-a-0019 98.450500 108.167750 four door yeah and very very comfortable car big roomy trunk uh and uh and very happy with it and i must admit it's you know if if if uh
sw3573A-ms98-a-0020 108.167750 117.899500 yeah my only consideration were were you know buying another car just to tool around town and and make you know brief trips and things like that i i would very very seriously consider buying one
sw3573A-ms98-a-0021 117.899500 125.456625 uh i think they're extraordinarily reliable cars um my my real concern with with uh
sw3573A-ms98-a-0022 125.456625 133.846000 uh why i'm not sure i- i want to buy a Honda is because i have to make a kind of a a steady um trip down the road
sw3573A-ms98-a-0023 133.846000 140.300500 about once a month because i'm divorced and i have a daughter that lives down in North Carolina and uh
sw3573A-ms98-a-0024 140.300500 145.167125 i i drive down interstate ninety five and it's just an absolutely wild highway 
sw3573A-ms98-a-0025 145.167125 147.014500 [silence]
sw3573A-ms98-a-0026 147.014500 149.023875 yeah and
sw3573A-ms98-a-0027 149.023875 151.782750 [silence]
sw3573A-ms98-a-0028 151.782750 152.997875 uh-huh
sw3573A-ms98-a-0029 152.997875 156.337500 [silence]
sw3573A-ms98-a-0030 156.337500 162.851875 and y[ou]- well you've got it and uh so having precious cargo in the car with me [laughter]
sw3573A-ms98-a-0031 162.851875 171.909625 as you can well imagine it's very hard for me to imagine that that uh a Honda's going to be as safe a car as as the one that i've got got my eye on which is a Volvo
sw3573A-ms98-a-0032 171.909625 181.983375 in in fact [vocalized-noise] quite frankly i've owned a Volvo in the past and uh i've i've they're expensive cars to keep up when they need service but uh [noise]
sw3573A-ms98-a-0033 181.983375 190.102375 i've found that i've had a lot of luck with them uh course i'm a mechanically inclined kind of person and i always wind up getting under the hood and finding out all the things that
sw3573A-ms98-a-0034 190.102375 200.696000 you know need to be taken care of and so forth and i guess that's one thing that that recommends the Honda to a lot of people is is there's just very little that you have to do under the hood and
sw3573A-ms98-a-0035 200.696000 208.644875 [silence]
sw3573A-ms98-a-0036 208.644875 211.003000 oh i know it's really amazing
sw3573A-ms98-a-0037 211.003000 212.891625 it's [laughter]
sw3573A-ms98-a-0038 212.891625 214.986250 absolutely incredible
sw3573A-ms98-a-0039 214.986250 215.955500 [laughter]
sw3573A-ms98-a-0040 215.955500 228.615625 so um yeah anyway i've been looking at the prices of these cars and a[nd]- and so forth and i think that it's it's very surprising some of these very expensive Volvos can be gotten for a lot less money than you would think if you're willing to
sw3573A-ms98-a-0041 228.615625 233.009625 buy ones that are about the vintage of the the cars that you and i currently own
sw3573A-ms98-a-0042 233.009625 234.718875 and um
sw3573A-ms98-a-0043 234.718875 237.733625 [silence]
sw3573A-ms98-a-0044 237.733625 246.175875 well certainly some of the top end ones you can still get get uh even the the low end wagons um for less than twenty thousand dollars
sw3573A-ms98-a-0045 246.175875 253.174875 and uh we get you know in the Washington area of course being as affluent as it is there are lots and lots of Volvo dealerships down here
sw3573A-ms98-a-0046 253.174875 260.473375 so there're lots and lots of them available in the paper at any any week and i sort of you know scan the paper and look at them and so forth and
sw3573A-ms98-a-0047 260.473375 272.099875 so um [noise] anyway and that's that's the other thing is that i've i've never really been too terribly much of a new car person i think i've bought one or two new cars in my life and i've tended to um
sw3573A-ms98-a-0048 272.099875 281.984500 to uh buy cars that are you know two or three and sometimes even four and five or six years old this Honda that i have i bought used and
sw3573A-ms98-a-0049 281.984500 290.509875 in fact it had an extraordinarily low amount of mileage on it i've just rolled seventy thousand miles and it's a seventy four i mean an eighty four [laughter-so] 
sw3573A-ms98-a-0050 290.509875 291.063250 [vocalized-noise]
sw3573A-ms98-a-0051 291.063250 292.775000 [silence]
sw3573A-ms98-a-0052 292.775000 294.036000 yeah
