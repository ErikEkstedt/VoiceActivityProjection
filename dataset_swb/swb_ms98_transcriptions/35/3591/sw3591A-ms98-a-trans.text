sw3591A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.408375 [noise] well
sw3591A-ms98-a-0002 1.408375 6.376875 [silence]
sw3591A-ms98-a-0003 6.376875 14.446625 well yes i do um this is a a question that hit pretty close to home uh i had to go through this with my dad about
sw3591A-ms98-a-0004 14.446625 18.403625 four years ago he was his health was failing
sw3591A-ms98-a-0005 18.403625 27.280125 and uh he was adamant about two things one was that i take care of my mother and two that he not be put into a home
sw3591A-ms98-a-0006 27.280125 33.637375 and we talked [vocalized-noise] about some length and i respected his wishes he uh
sw3591A-ms98-a-0007 33.637375 39.911375 [noise] stayed at home as long as he could and then uh he died in a hospital but um
sw3591A-ms98-a-0008 39.911375 49.994125 i think that my position wa[s]- is that uh you you need to find one that you can really have confidence that they are taking care of the
sw3591A-ms98-a-0009 49.994125 53.377250 of their uh of their clients
sw3591A-ms98-a-0010 53.377250 55.917875 and um
sw3591A-ms98-a-0011 55.917875 57.331375 [silence]
sw3591A-ms98-a-0012 57.331375 64.106875 [noise] because i've heard about the many abuses and because_1 he had heard of so many abuses he just didn't want that
sw3591A-ms98-a-0013 64.106875 66.001875 how about_1 you
sw3591A-ms98-a-0014 66.001875 81.507125 [silence]
sw3591A-ms98-a-0015 81.507125 84.985875 yeah almost thirty a[ll]- all over thirty percent isn't it
sw3591A-ms98-a-0016 84.985875 124.192375 [silence]
sw3591A-ms98-a-0017 124.192375 125.408875 um-hum
sw3591A-ms98-a-0018 125.408875 142.075250 [silence]
sw3591A-ms98-a-0019 142.075250 143.551500 they're captives
sw3591A-ms98-a-0020 143.551500 147.282875 [silence]
sw3591A-ms98-a-0021 147.282875 155.420000 uh we had a at one stage we had care somewhat like like what you're talking about we had the Visiting Nurses Program
sw3591A-ms98-a-0022 155.420000 162.119875 and they sent somebody in and it it was a a nominal charge that this uh
sw3591A-ms98-a-0023 162.119875 169.717875 it started out the lady would come in i think three times a week and eventually got up to the point where they were coming by every day
sw3591A-ms98-a-0024 169.717875 177.176875 they would try to get him to exercise they would try to uh you know they would check him over temperature
sw3591A-ms98-a-0025 177.176875 179.155750 you know the basic checks
sw3591A-ms98-a-0026 179.155750 184.845875 try to get him to talk and be motivated and uh that's what we went through
sw3591A-ms98-a-0027 184.845875 193.246625 uh up to a points things seemed to be working and then i i think he he became discouraged 
sw3591A-ms98-a-0028 193.246625 201.038500 and they did not know how to take care of that and then um at that point i think it mostly a psychological problem
sw3591A-ms98-a-0029 201.038500 206.744000 and uh but yes i agree there's a lot of options there could be a lot of options
sw3591A-ms98-a-0030 206.744000 211.457250 i think it's time that uh we decide to do something about it
sw3591A-ms98-a-0031 211.457250 213.270250 um
sw3591A-ms98-a-0032 213.270250 247.385500 [silence]
sw3591A-ms98-a-0033 247.385500 252.300375 [noise] i suppose at one time the church would fulfill this need
sw3591A-ms98-a-0034 252.300375 253.344500 [silence]
sw3591A-ms98-a-0035 253.344500 263.702375 yeah the church or synagogue whatever because typically these were close-knit groups at one time but in today's large metropolitan areas or even
sw3591A-ms98-a-0036 263.702375 270.537375 [noise] in most even even the rural areas now people are not quite as close as they once were
sw3591A-ms98-a-0037 270.537375 274.922250 uh the mobility factor the factor that uh
sw3591A-ms98-a-0038 274.922250 278.803875 oh we're living longer and
sw3591A-ms98-a-0039 278.803875 286.242000 people are less trusting all these things tend to destroy this type of system but i agree with you it it might be some possibilities there
sw3591A-ms98-a-0040 286.242000 289.580750 although dealing with geriatrics
sw3591A-ms98-a-0041 289.580750 294.216750 is something a lot of young people just aren't emotionally prepared to do
sw3591A-ms98-a-0042 294.216750 298.082000 [noise] i think they would have to have some training so[me]-
