sw3543A-ms98-a-0022 86.589250 92.037500 one of the worst crimes in my book and uh drug dealing hm
sw3543A-ms98-a-0023 92.037500 99.727000 that's close but uh terrorism definitely and uh selling out your country
sw3543A-ms98-a-0024 99.727000 101.216000 uh
sw3543A-ms98-a-0025 101.216000 106.301375 no it's got to be something that is gonna cost them_1 because_1 we never lock anybody up forever

sw3543A-ms98-a-0031 121.665125 124.719000 and i guess they got convicted the four of
sw3543A-ms98-a-0032 124.719000 126.510875 uh uh murder
sw3543A-ms98-a-0033 126.510875 127.564125 [silence]
sw3543A-ms98-a-0034 127.564125 131.834500 so you've come to a definite opinion on it now
sw3543A-ms98-a-0035 131.834500 157.046125 [silence]
sw3543A-ms98-a-0036 157.046125 159.333500 [noise] yeah you kind of hate to

sw3543A-ms98-a-0043 191.958375 193.005375 [silence]
sw3543A-ms98-a-0044 193.005375 199.912625 i kind of have a problem with our legal system at the moment uh as it is i think that people who
sw3543A-ms98-a-0045 199.912625 208.988500 uh infringe on other people's rights uh and screw up their whole lives with rape uh child molesting uh
sw3543A-ms98-a-0046 208.988500 217.590250 terrorism just a there's just like five things that i think they ought to be snuffed for but i'm i'm for it for certain reasons
sw3543A-ms98-a-0047 217.590250 224.518875 and i think that things like rape uh you can't get over uh takes a lifetime
sw3543A-ms98-a-0048 224.518875 228.636000 [silence]
sw3543A-ms98-a-0049 228.636000 231.681625 [noise] um if it was
sw3543A-ms98-a-0050 231.681625 234.515000 yeah if it was
sw3543A-ms98-a-0051 234.515000 236.769000 it'd probably have to be a pattern
sw3543A-ms98-a-0052 236.769000 242.704375 you know we have plenty of convicted guys that go into jail and come back out do the same thing and go back and
sw3543A-ms98-a-0053 242.704375 250.619500 uh if they're habitual like three times caught for rape or child molesting then snuff them_1
sw3543A-ms98-a-0054 250.619500 251.639625 [silence]
sw3543A-ms98-a-0055 251.639625 252.634750 good

sw3543A-ms98-a-0059 259.973750 264.725500 yeah but we don't seem to keep them_1 long enough
sw3543A-ms98-a-0060 264.725500 270.762250 and then they learn such bad things in jail that isn't a place of rehabilitation
sw3543A-ms98-a-0061 270.762250 272.082875 [silence]
sw3543A-ms98-a-0062 272.082875 274.599625 yeah it's a tough question isn't it
sw3543A-ms98-a-0063 274.599625 283.919125 [noise] on whether at what point do they become so detrimental to society that society can't afford to keep them around to keep giving them chances
sw3543A-ms98-a-0064 283.919125 285.438875 [silence]
sw3543A-ms98-a-0065 285.438875 290.190125 hm [noise] let's see so the other questions that they wanted was
sw3543A-ms98-a-0066 290.190125 293.085750 whether the place that we live in
sw3543A-ms98-a-0067 293.085750 297.573750 uh compares to how we feel what's the laws there in DC
sw3543A-ms98-a-0068 297.573750 298.690000 [silence]
