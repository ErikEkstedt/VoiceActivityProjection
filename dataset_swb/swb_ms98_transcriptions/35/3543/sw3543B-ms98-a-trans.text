sw3543B-ms98-a-0015 53.646500 55.396250 it wasn't a strong issue
sw3543B-ms98-a-0016 55.396250 63.186625 um i guess it still isn't a strong issue but i must say i find it very silly the way politicians are running around creating more and more capital crimes
sw3543B-ms98-a-0017 63.186625 64.364625 um
sw3543B-ms98-a-0018 64.364625 70.145125 [noise] instead of dealing with rea[l]- you know the real problems they're you know they're they're they're getting votes presumably by
sw3543B-ms98-a-0019 70.145125 73.042000 um i assume they're doing it for that reason

sw3543B-ms98-a-0034 130.979375 139.827500 well i i've uh i[t]- it it it seems like it's gone gotten carried away um and i- i do find it hard to dr[aw]- know where to draw a line
sw3543B-ms98-a-0035 139.827500 146.929500 and so if i had to draw a line i'd say just no capital punishment i mean i don't i don't s[ee]- i don't see that it accomplishes a whole lot
sw3543B-ms98-a-0036 146.929500 149.451125 whereas i do think that
sw3543B-ms98-a-0037 149.451125 156.670125 convicting people and and incarcerating them for a long time if that could be improved upon that would have more impact i think
sw3543B-ms98-a-0038 156.670125 158.956250 [silence]
sw3543B-ms98-a-0039 158.956250 168.297000 no what what about the argument where where somebody who is committing [vocalized-noise] one capital crime chooses to commit a a more serious capital crime i mean murder
sw3543B-ms98-a-0040 168.297000 175.848625 um because that one at least you might escape from because his victim you know his witnesses will be gone

sw3543B-ms98-a-0042 176.895375 179.084375 doesn't this doesn't this encourage

sw3543B-ms98-a-0044 180.101000 187.802250 uh more se[rious]- doesn't doesn't this enc[ourage]- you know i mean doesn't this encourage murder in order to wipe out the
sw3543B-ms98-a-0045 187.802250 189.333500 the witnesses
sw3543B-ms98-a-0046 189.333500 210.140875 [silence]

sw3543B-ms98-a-0053 229.669375 232.831250 a six person jury could've decided either way of course [noise]

sw3543B-ms98-a-0057 251.391250 254.360375 well but there the problems that they just been let out of jail
sw3543B-ms98-a-0058 254.360375 259.666125 the problem there is that they've been let out jail if they've been thrice convicted they should have been kept in longer
