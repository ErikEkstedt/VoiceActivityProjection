sw3520B-ms98-a-0002 5.471125 19.859375 well i agree with the boredom of the election process but i also uh think that people don't realize that their boat vote will make a difference uh they feel like that
sw3520B-ms98-a-0003 19.859375 26.448375 you know it's going to go however it's going to go and their one little vote's not going to make that much difference and it's just why make the effort
sw3520B-ms98-a-0004 26.448375 29.351500 [silence]
sw3520B-ms98-a-0005 29.351500 37.103750 well i agree with that and i and i do know that y[ou]- you know all those votes are counted and and they do make a difference
sw3520B-ms98-a-0006 37.103750 39.161625 um also i think that
sw3520B-ms98-a-0007 39.161625 44.963250 people have a tendency to to vote in the larger elections and not vote in the
sw3520B-ms98-a-0008 44.963250 48.285500 the more local elections
sw3520B-ms98-a-0009 48.285500 49.425375 e[xactly]-
sw3520B-ms98-a-0010 49.425375 53.972000 [silence]
sw3520B-ms98-a-0011 53.972000 66.525625 exactly and uh i i even have a tendency to do that myself and i have to really make a concerted effort to to get involved i lived i live in a suburb in Mesquite
sw3520B-ms98-a-0012 66.525625 79.473000 and uh so i really have to make an effort to read the local paper and to see what's going to because that directly affects me but i i think on the whole most people don't
sw3520B-ms98-a-0013 79.473000 85.491375 uh feel that way or don't e[ven]- look even look at that i think they just don't even
sw3520B-ms98-a-0014 85.491375 87.918000 i i don't think they're conscious of it
sw3520B-ms98-a-0015 87.918000 91.487000 [silence]
sw3520B-ms98-a-0016 91.487000 95.019750 well that may be true too i hadn't thought of that
sw3520B-ms98-a-0017 95.019750 102.739375 [silence]
sw3520B-ms98-a-0018 102.739375 103.820125 um-hum
sw3520B-ms98-a-0019 103.820125 105.024500 right
sw3520B-ms98-a-0020 105.024500 106.889250 and sometimes it's uh
sw3520B-ms98-a-0021 106.889250 113.989500 well not sometimes but many times it's who has the most money to spend on the largest campaign and
sw3520B-ms98-a-0022 113.989500 117.247125 and issues get uh bogged down
sw3520B-ms98-a-0023 117.247125 120.730750 [silence]
sw3520B-ms98-a-0024 120.730750 127.217625 um i think voter awareness i w[orked]- i did some work for the uh Women's League of uh
sw3520B-ms98-a-0025 127.217625 128.406375 [silence]
sw3520B-ms98-a-0026 128.406375 132.075875 Voters uh several years ago
sw3520B-ms98-a-0027 132.075875 143.938625 and i think there are some organizations that used to uh do some voter awareness uh things do[n't]- they don't get a lot of participation they don't get a lot of uh
sw3520B-ms98-a-0028 143.938625 148.826000 activity most of the League of Women Voters
sw3520B-ms98-a-0029 148.826000 152.660125 what they did was they put out information
sw3520B-ms98-a-0030 152.660125 167.585875 so that it it would just be made available to everyone now other areas that i've worked in like in the chambers they would just have the candidates come and it would just you know that was not a l[ot]- lot of community involvement and those were people that would mostly vote anyway
sw3520B-ms98-a-0031 167.585875 180.009500 [silence]
sw3520B-ms98-a-0032 180.009500 188.427125 it's a it's an ongoing campaign and it's expensive campaign and it it uh eliminates a lot of qualified people
sw3520B-ms98-a-0033 188.427125 193.454750 uh maybe more qualified and uh more dedicated
sw3520B-ms98-a-0034 193.454750 194.646125 uh
sw3520B-ms98-a-0035 194.646125 196.584000 uh to the issues

sw3520B-ms98-a-0039 201.960500 207.045375 i i can't b[elieve]- i just can't believe i've i've worked in a couple of local campaigns
sw3520B-ms98-a-0040 207.045375 210.375250 i just cannot believe the dollars that are spent just even locally
sw3520B-ms98-a-0041 210.375250 214.791875 [silence]
sw3520B-ms98-a-0042 214.791875 217.278000 oh well i agree with that
sw3520B-ms98-a-0043 217.278000 220.326000 but also and i and i'm not for
sw3520B-ms98-a-0044 220.326000 223.743875 c[ontrolling]- controlling how much is spent but do you know
sw3520B-ms98-a-0045 223.743875 227.081000 that's one thing if a if the time wasn't so
sw3520B-ms98-a-0046 227.081000 231.508750 if it wasn't such a long uh campaigning time
sw3520B-ms98-a-0047 231.508750 232.942500 then
sw3520B-ms98-a-0048 232.942500 234.009250 [silence]
sw3520B-ms98-a-0049 234.009250 235.929500 they couldn't spend as much money
sw3520B-ms98-a-0050 235.929500 238.548000 [silence]
sw3520B-ms98-a-0051 238.548000 240.997375 no they really don't
sw3520B-ms98-a-0052 240.997375 245.337500 uh it's alway[s]- it's a lot of it is who looks the best
sw3520B-ms98-a-0053 245.337500 247.154375 who uh
sw3520B-ms98-a-0054 247.154375 253.482500 who happens to say the right thing at the right time who n[ot]- not it who may not be
