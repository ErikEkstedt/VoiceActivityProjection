sw3577B-ms98-a-0018 94.517375 104.578500 anyway i think the solution in my opinion is to have something political to talk about is for the government to get out of business and leave us alone rather than get into business what's your feeling

sw3577B-ms98-a-0029 186.725000 193.149750 they'll stretch the hours and they'll do without insurance and they and i think that when it was control there was
sw3577B-ms98-a-0030 193.149750 197.914125 better safety but i don't know if the accident ratios will prove that out or not
