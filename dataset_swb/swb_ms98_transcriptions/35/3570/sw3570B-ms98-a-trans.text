sw3570B-ms98-a-0002 9.542875 17.197625 i think that the space program has done a lot of good for the country now i think what we made a major
sw3570B-ms98-a-0003 17.197625 20.509375 wrong turn we went into the uh
sw3570B-ms98-a-0004 20.509375 26.694250 to the current generation of space craft the reusable ones like they are now
sw3570B-ms98-a-0005 26.694250 36.524375 because they have not proven as reliable as they should have and i think some of the earlier approaches were much more um much better in many ways
sw3570B-ms98-a-0006 36.524375 45.044000 however um you know we've gained an awful lot from the space program all the way from remote monitoring to Teflon to uh
sw3570B-ms98-a-0007 45.044000 50.779000 some new space age materials plastics and all that so i think it's been a good investment
sw3570B-ms98-a-0008 50.779000 54.111750 uh somebody was telling me the return
sw3570B-ms98-a-0009 54.111750 58.268000 was about twenty five or thirty dollars for every dollar spent
sw3570B-ms98-a-0010 58.268000 71.425375 which is amazing for any governmental financed program [noise] [laughter] i wish the post office just stop raising our rates um
sw3570B-ms98-a-0011 71.425375 77.394250 [noise] i think though that now that we're finally starting to get over the fears and the uh
sw3570B-ms98-a-0012 77.394250 84.595625 oh i don't know the guilt that we had out of uh Challenger i think maybe we can pick up and go on now but
sw3570B-ms98-a-0013 84.595625 91.937375 i i don't know i don't think we're really have all of our act together yet as far as clear objectives
sw3570B-ms98-a-0014 91.937375 94.595000 the space station is where we should go
sw3570B-ms98-a-0015 94.595000 96.097250 at this point
sw3570B-ms98-a-0016 96.097250 117.796000 [silence]
