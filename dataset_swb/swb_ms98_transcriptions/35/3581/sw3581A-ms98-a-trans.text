sw3581A-ms98-a-0003 1.205625 4.378375 so what was the last car repair that you had done on your car
sw3581A-ms98-a-0004 4.378375 10.138625 [silence]
sw3581A-ms98-a-0005 10.138625 11.441500 um-hum
sw3581A-ms98-a-0006 11.441500 17.389000 [silence]
sw3581A-ms98-a-0007 17.389000 20.263125 the control module a mystery box huh
sw3581A-ms98-a-0008 20.263125 21.349625 yeah
sw3581A-ms98-a-0009 21.349625 30.453500 [silence]
sw3581A-ms98-a-0010 30.453500 35.987250 that's that's impressive he's able to do a job like that because that requires special tools
sw3581A-ms98-a-0011 35.987250 41.227625 [silence]
sw3581A-ms98-a-0012 41.227625 43.027625 oh that's interesting
sw3581A-ms98-a-0013 43.027625 45.417000 [silence]
sw3581A-ms98-a-0014 45.417000 47.440250 that that's great what
sw3581A-ms98-a-0015 47.440250 51.411375 what kind of jobs would you folks [laughter-repair] re[fer]- refer to a garage
sw3581A-ms98-a-0016 51.411375 66.412875 [silence]
sw3581A-ms98-a-0017 66.412875 67.720625 um-hum
sw3581A-ms98-a-0018 67.720625 81.473375 [silence]
sw3581A-ms98-a-0019 81.473375 82.717875 wow
sw3581A-ms98-a-0020 82.717875 83.745000 [silence]
sw3581A-ms98-a-0021 83.745000 92.176000 well um the last thing that i had to have done to my car uh i wound up doing myself and um that was uh tuning it up
sw3581A-ms98-a-0022 92.176000 102.778875 and um i had been having a a problem where i would be driving along and and i would notice this at night when i'd be sitting at a light i would see smoke in my uh
sw3581A-ms98-a-0023 102.778875 113.481375 my headlights and uh then later on when you know i'd i'd get out wherever i was going i would smell uh something had been burning
sw3581A-ms98-a-0024 113.481375 123.757375 and i pretty much figured it was oil because i'd looked under the hood a couple of times and there was a a lot more oil sort of floating around than you should have on a Honda which i [laughter-ironically] have too
sw3581A-ms98-a-0025 123.757375 128.165750 [noise] you'd expect the car to be really clean inside
sw3581A-ms98-a-0026 128.165750 135.716500 and it run real well real well and so anyway i i had been thinking about it for a long time and discovered that um
sw3581A-ms98-a-0027 135.716500 146.773250 uh or i had decided that what had happened is there's a a a little piece of metal that sits there over the top of the valve train called the valve uh uh cover
sw3581A-ms98-a-0028 146.773250 156.380125 and uh i decided that there must be something wrong with the gasket or perhaps the the whole cover itself hadn't been uh tightened down well or whatever and so
sw3581A-ms98-a-0029 156.380125 160.471750 when i was doing this tune up i decided it was time for me to explore
sw3581A-ms98-a-0030 160.471750 163.525250 and sure enough that's what the problem was
sw3581A-ms98-a-0031 163.525250 168.200625 and so i went out and i got a new gasket and slipped it in there
sw3581A-ms98-a-0032 168.200625 181.589125 and on on older cars up to i- i in fact i have no idea when they started doing this but but on the older cars they used to make the gasket out of a cork like material and on this car they make it out of a rubber like material
sw3581A-ms98-a-0033 181.589125 183.163125 so uh
sw3581A-ms98-a-0034 183.163125 184.975375 [silence]
sw3581A-ms98-a-0035 184.975375 191.123875 yeah up to a certain point i used to do a lot more of it when i was younger than i do now um
sw3581A-ms98-a-0036 191.123875 203.225000 and i have to admit that when the weather starts to get cold there's just no fun like a busted knuckle i just uh i just can't even tell you the joy i get from that experience and
sw3581A-ms98-a-0037 203.225000 215.201750 [silence]
sw3581A-ms98-a-0038 215.201750 223.603250 sure and my finances have always been a little precarious so sometimes repairing the car is a financial necessity
sw3581A-ms98-a-0039 223.603250 229.533250 um but it's the the down side of that is that i very rarely always had the right tools and
sw3581A-ms98-a-0040 229.533250 230.944625 i've
sw3581A-ms98-a-0041 230.944625 242.094625 [laughter-yeah] exactly yeah yeah it's a sort of a catch twenty two if you're well enough off to buy these exotic tools you need to do the work then you can generally have somebody else do it for you
sw3581A-ms98-a-0042 242.094625 243.387500 so
sw3581A-ms98-a-0043 243.387500 247.608125 [silence]
sw3581A-ms98-a-0044 247.608125 249.702625 well um
sw3581A-ms98-a-0045 249.702625 255.909875 it's funny i've i've owned a lot of different cars i started out with Volkswagons and then um
sw3581A-ms98-a-0046 255.909875 264.690500 uh graduated to um a Honda and had that for a long time and then graduated to a Volvo and then wound up with a Honda again
sw3581A-ms98-a-0047 264.690500 269.331000 and so i've i've [noise] had them all and and uh
sw3581A-ms98-a-0048 269.331000 281.121500 uh have gotten to know the engines in each one of these uh sorts of vehicles and but uh i in the Volkswagon business i- i went from you know owning a bug to owning uh one of their cars called a Rabbit
sw3581A-ms98-a-0049 281.121500 295.053250 and the and there was a completely different kind of engine in the Rabbit um but i i actually rebuilt a Volkswagon bug engine at one point and uh so i learned an awful lot about cars uh that way and
sw3581A-ms98-a-0050 295.053250 300.002000 [silence]
