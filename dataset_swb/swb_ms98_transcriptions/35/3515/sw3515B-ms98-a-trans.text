sw3515B-ms98-a-0025 105.139125 114.350000 off the off the price if you wanna think of it that way so when we get like uh um a twelve pack then that's like twelve cents back
sw3515B-ms98-a-0026 114.350000 116.491750 [silence]

sw3515B-ms98-a-0036 160.096000 166.447250 [silence]
sw3515B-ms98-a-0037 166.447250 179.808625 i- i- i tell you what what really works uh at least down here is if there is if there is some e[ven]- even some money basically to take care of the gas
sw3515B-ms98-a-0038 179.808625 185.446125 to recycle it you know what i mean then people tend to do it uh
sw3515B-ms98-a-0039 185.446125 190.211875 in other words uh taking care of the environment is is all well and good
sw3515B-ms98-a-0040 190.211875 200.413625 but if it's gonna cost you to take care of the environment they're not quite as uh likely to do it as if uh as if you get something back for it
sw3515B-ms98-a-0041 200.413625 212.751750 you know and uh so you know if there are some energy savings or if there's some significant savings anything that they can pass on to the consumer
sw3515B-ms98-a-0042 212.751750 216.664375 you know it kind of reminds me of using an ATM card
sw3515B-ms98-a-0043 216.664375 225.811875 you know to get money or doing your banking you know if it's free people will use it if it costs them_1 something then they're not as likely to use it
sw3515B-ms98-a-0044 225.811875 227.469625 you know
sw3515B-ms98-a-0045 227.469625 234.252750 but uh i know we had a problem down here with uh oil people taking oil out of their cars
sw3515B-ms98-a-0046 234.252750 238.159250 and just putting it down the d[rain]- you know the s[ewer]- the drain sewer
sw3515B-ms98-a-0047 238.159250 249.566875 and uh all that because_1 there was apparently a lot of people you know every time they change the oil they just dump all the res[t]- their old oil down there now they're starting to recycle that stuff
sw3515B-ms98-a-0048 249.566875 267.736875 [silence]
sw3515B-ms98-a-0049 267.736875 269.273250 yeah
