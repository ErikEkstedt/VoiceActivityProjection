sw3515A-ms98-a-0038 190.980000 195.206625 [silence]
sw3515A-ms98-a-0039 195.206625 198.472625 as likely to do it yeah
sw3515A-ms98-a-0040 198.472625 200.545375 [silence]
sw3515A-ms98-a-0041 200.545375 203.025125 yeah that's true
sw3515A-ms98-a-0042 203.025125 217.487250 [silence]

sw3515A-ms98-a-0052 248.231000 250.566375 oh that's good
sw3515A-ms98-a-0053 250.566375 258.918000 um another thing i thought of i guess to recycle would be like clothes because i mean everybody gets rid of their clothes sometime or other
sw3515A-ms98-a-0054 258.918000 264.678250 and [noise] one way that we do it sort of in in Iowa is that
sw3515A-ms98-a-0055 264.678250 268.321500 we can take some of our clothes to the consignment shops
sw3515A-ms98-a-0056 268.321500 281.243625 and that way you know you don't get near enough as as much as you bought it for but you you got the use out of it and what you're gonna basically donate t[o]- to a Goodwill or whatever anyways you can get a little bit of money for
sw3515A-ms98-a-0057 281.243625 293.542500 and so that's something that i've never i we're we're new to Iowa and so that's something that i hadn't you know looked into before but that's one way to sort of get money and still recycle i guess 
sw3515A-ms98-a-0058 293.542500 298.530000 [silence]
