sw3504A-ms98-a-0009 27.937250 36.612250 right yeah i think it's gonna have a big effect if they don't on the other uh Hispanic players
sw3504A-ms98-a-0010 36.612250 39.596000 i think that's gonna be the big problem
sw3504A-ms98-a-0011 39.596000 41.964625 [silence]
sw3504A-ms98-a-0012 41.964625 43.308500 right

sw3504A-ms98-a-0020 69.767250 73.283750 right i think they're just want a stay mediocre and
sw3504A-ms98-a-0021 73.283750 82.025875 draw their two million fans out there and then be happy with it and not have to pay the bucks to get a contender in here
sw3504A-ms98-a-0022 82.025875 83.479875 but
sw3504A-ms98-a-0023 83.479875 84.884750 [silence]

sw3504A-ms98-a-0031 99.504625 103.590125 [laughter] that's true but uh
sw3504A-ms98-a-0032 103.590125 107.662375 they're talking about trading him if they're not able to sign him
sw3504A-ms98-a-0033 107.662375 112.720750 and uh use the money that it would take [noise] to sign the guy
sw3504A-ms98-a-0034 112.720750 117.247500 you know to pay for pitchers or
sw3504A-ms98-a-0035 117.247500 120.766500 you know what it what it what they what else they need
sw3504A-ms98-a-0036 120.766500 124.126000 because_1 they've got the hitting but they need the pitching
sw3504A-ms98-a-0037 124.126000 125.162125 [silence]
sw3504A-ms98-a-0038 125.162125 126.300000 um

sw3504A-ms98-a-0042 147.530500 154.269750 yeah it's sure aggravating when you go out and bust your butt working you know your day job and
sw3504A-ms98-a-0043 154.269750 160.662875 you can work your day job the rest of your life and not bring home as much money as they bring home in one game
sw3504A-ms98-a-0044 160.662875 162.191625 [laughter]
sw3504A-ms98-a-0045 162.191625 164.679625 that's real aggravating but

sw3504A-ms98-a-0049 182.879750 185.920500 it's always got yeah it's always
sw3504A-ms98-a-0050 185.920500 199.200625 it's always wondered me why i mean they act as though this area is not you know a big metropolitan area but you think we'd someday get an owner in here that could afford to buy the the the players we need
sw3504A-ms98-a-0051 199.200625 210.138125 just real aggravating to [noise] because_1 i've lived here you know since well i was born and raised here so i've been a Ranger fan since
sw3504A-ms98-a-0052 210.138125 219.907500 about seventy seven so it's a lot of losers [laughter] it's about to get you know as bad as the Cubs or whoever you know
sw3504A-ms98-a-0053 219.907500 227.124875 [silence]
sw3504A-ms98-a-0054 227.124875 228.702625 right

sw3504A-ms98-a-0060 244.542625 249.468125 right i think this town'd go crazy if they ever got a even a play-off team
sw3504A-ms98-a-0061 249.468125 260.190625 t[ime]- i mean it would be packed and they got that new stadium they're building so at least at least that'll be exciting [laughter] when we get that but
sw3504A-ms98-a-0062 260.190625 261.494875 [silence]
sw3504A-ms98-a-0063 261.494875 268.591000 uh it's hard to say it's gonna be depending on where the what they do with Ruben Sierra and
sw3504A-ms98-a-0064 268.591000 280.332750 uh i mean i'm getting tired of them_1 going into each year saying you know Bobby Witt's the answer and Kevin Brown's the answer and man that's getting old you know these guys have been pampered i mean
sw3504A-ms98-a-0065 280.332750 284.954250 it's time to to either you know put out or shut up
sw3504A-ms98-a-0066 284.954250 286.723250 and
sw3504A-ms98-a-0067 286.723250 289.529000 [silence]
sw3504A-ms98-a-0068 289.529000 291.158625 right and
sw3504A-ms98-a-0069 291.158625 292.537500 [silence]
sw3504A-ms98-a-0070 292.537500 299.074000 and Valentine and Greave they're about to get you know they're about to get old but i like this Sandy Johnson
