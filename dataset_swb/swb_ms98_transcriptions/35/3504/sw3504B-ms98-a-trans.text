sw3504B-ms98-a-0002 3.585375 9.000000 is it i'd have to agree with that they're my favorite team too been a little disappointing the last few years
sw3504B-ms98-a-0003 9.000000 12.216000 [silence]
sw3504B-ms98-a-0004 12.216000 14.052250 you know
sw3504B-ms98-a-0005 14.052250 17.570875 i really don't i just don't think
sw3504B-ms98-a-0006 17.570875 28.921875 with you know with that guy from Pittsburgh getting all that money twenty seven or twenty nine million or whatever it was i just don't think that they're gonna be able to sign Ruben Sierra and it's just gonna be a shame for you know our area 
sw3504B-ms98-a-0007 28.921875 35.771500 [silence]
sw3504B-ms98-a-0008 35.771500 38.979875 oh i do too i just the main thing is that
sw3504B-ms98-a-0009 38.979875 42.861250 it's just gonna have an effect on the the team you know
sw3504B-ms98-a-0010 42.861250 45.290250 we just can't seem to
sw3504B-ms98-a-0011 45.290250 51.192125 you know i think we've been in this spot i think we finished second once or maybe even twice i don't know i
sw3504B-ms98-a-0012 51.192125 52.510625 [silence]
sw3504B-ms98-a-0013 52.510625 56.064375 i haven't been to a baseball game in a couple of years just
sw3504B-ms98-a-0014 56.064375 59.953000 it's just too disappointing i just watch them_1 fall every year
sw3504B-ms98-a-0015 59.953000 63.113875 i was a Pete Incaviglia fan and uh
sw3504B-ms98-a-0016 63.113875 70.144875 i liked him but of course i understand baseball decisions are all just decisions like that have to be made by someone [laughter-glad] it's not me making them_1
sw3504B-ms98-a-0017 70.144875 79.696875 [silence]
sw3504B-ms98-a-0018 79.696875 81.905000 [noise]
sw3504B-ms98-a-0019 81.905000 87.651625 well they say as long as they draw up two million fans that Greave and Valentine'll be there
sw3504B-ms98-a-0020 87.651625 93.761375 so and that's the name of the game too you got to make money you know they pay these players so much money now it's just
sw3504B-ms98-a-0021 93.761375 101.818000 it's frightening you and i should be so lucky to you know to go out and swing a bat and get two thousand dollars every time you swing the bat [laughter-or] [laughter-something] [laughter-like] [laughter-that]
sw3504B-ms98-a-0022 101.818000 123.581875 [silence]
sw3504B-ms98-a-0023 123.581875 125.714125 yeah they really do
sw3504B-ms98-a-0024 125.714125 127.544625 i think they uh
sw3504B-ms98-a-0025 127.544625 135.056375 i think they need them_1 all i just don't under[stand]- i understand the big cities like in New York or LA or somewhere because big cities and you know
sw3504B-ms98-a-0026 135.056375 141.285250 a guy a pro athlete can go out there in the afternoon probably make five thousand dollars just by doing a personal appearance at a
sw3504B-ms98-a-0027 141.285250 148.227500 at a at a men's clothing store or something or sporting goods store but i realize the difference but i just don't understand

sw3504B-ms98-a-0029 159.884125 163.185000 oh i know i tell you
sw3504B-ms98-a-0030 163.185000 166.777125 but i one thing i don't understand is why
sw3504B-ms98-a-0031 166.777125 177.064750 a group you know headed up by George Bush would buy the Texas Rangers and not really get behind them_1 because i tell you we need a winner in this town looks like our Cowboys are coming back but
sw3504B-ms98-a-0032 177.064750 183.174375 so that's that's going to be a big help to Dallas but you know in the past half a [laughter-dozen] years all we've had is the uh
sw3504B-ms98-a-0033 183.174375 185.142625 yeah the soccer team
sw3504B-ms98-a-0034 185.142625 198.489125 [silence]

sw3504B-ms98-a-0040 224.053875 234.980375 [noise] excuse me i don't miss a time picking up the morning paper and checking the box scores i mean i follow them and i follow them_1 like i follow the Mavericks and like i follow the Cowboys but and i want to see them_1 win because
sw3504B-ms98-a-0041 234.980375 242.374375 you know damn it they the fans deserve it i mean it you know we have pretty uh great fans to put two million people in that stadium
sw3504B-ms98-a-0042 242.374375 245.349000 i love Nolan Ryan i guess you probably love him too
sw3504B-ms98-a-0043 245.349000 249.626125 [silence]

sw3504B-ms98-a-0050 276.599375 283.514625 [silence]
sw3504B-ms98-a-0051 283.514625 293.212875 yeah Bobby Witt gets forced into wins like seventeen games or whatever and they have the later ten game winning streak and they give him all kinds of money and then he just goes right down the tube
sw3504B-ms98-a-0052 293.212875 299.074000 [silence]
