sw3509B-ms98-a-0040 185.064625 198.735375 one of the s[tates]- well i guess there's more and more states that are that are going back to capital punishment um Texas has had it for a while it's one of the quicker it once it was uh it was reallowed i think it was outlawed for a while by the by the supreme court i mean or or the interpretation of the constitution
sw3509B-ms98-a-0041 198.735375 207.500750 and it seems like everybody stopped and then and then once they sort of reallowed it Texas was one of the first to uh to actually uh implement it again
sw3509B-ms98-a-0042 207.500750 210.931375 they do it by uh by l[ethal]- do it by lethal injection
