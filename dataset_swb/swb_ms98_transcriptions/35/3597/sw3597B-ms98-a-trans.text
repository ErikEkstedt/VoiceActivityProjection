sw3597B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 4.423250 [noise]
sw3597B-ms98-a-0002 4.423250 13.379750 [noise] i think one of the thing that i notice a lot i know it's touching social changes but uh to me what becomes socially acceptable
sw3597B-ms98-a-0003 13.379750 27.975625 and i i don't know if it's a factor of me growing older and seeing things through different eyes or if it's a factor of our society actually moving in that direction but i notice things on TV being more um
sw3597B-ms98-a-0004 27.975625 40.931000 [noise] open [noise] more i i believe that they portray things on TV obviously that they never would've years ago and you know and specifically nudity things like that um
sw3597B-ms98-a-0005 40.931000 50.181625 i- i don't know i i've said several times to my husband that i feel like jeez in ten years they'll have just full nudity on TV and nobody'll think anything of it
sw3597B-ms98-a-0006 50.181625 60.947375 and to me that's surprising to me that's that's a big change to accept it and it comes across i think subtly you know little at a time to where you get so used to seeing a little change that
sw3597B-ms98-a-0007 60.947375 67.940500 you know when they go uh one step further you don't notice it that much so that's one of the biggest ones i've seen
sw3597B-ms98-a-0008 67.940500 69.073125 [silence]
sw3597B-ms98-a-0009 69.073125 71.027250 [noise] what about you
sw3597B-ms98-a-0010 71.027250 99.435500 [silence]
sw3597B-ms98-a-0011 99.435500 101.558125 um-hum
sw3597B-ms98-a-0012 101.558125 102.994625 [silence]
sw3597B-ms98-a-0013 102.994625 115.749000 i tend to agree with you and i think there's a lot of that um ah yeah we have become lawsuit happy any little thing it's like let's see what i can get don't you think that maybe a lot of that came from um
sw3597B-ms98-a-0014 115.749000 122.973375 [noise] oh you know the the the era we went through that was like you know hey if it makes you happy do it
sw3597B-ms98-a-0015 122.973375 134.017375 [noise] you know kind of like disregard to others do what makes you happy and and yes we should take care of ourselves you know and we should see to our own lives but not to a total disregard of others
sw3597B-ms98-a-0016 134.017375 135.438250 um
sw3597B-ms98-a-0017 135.438250 141.902000 i don't know i think it's come to that a lot i see it a lot in my daughter i have a four year old [noise] and
sw3597B-ms98-a-0018 141.902000 153.058500 hers isn't a social thing as much as it's a stage they go through but whenever something happens it's you made me hit that you made me do this and so i try to tell her Brianna
sw3597B-ms98-a-0019 153.058500 164.482375 everything isn't always somebody else's fault you know you have to watch where you're going [laughter] and and so it's what you just said kind of hits home to me just through her
sw3597B-ms98-a-0020 164.482375 165.974750 so
sw3597B-ms98-a-0021 165.974750 178.086000 [silence]
sw3597B-ms98-a-0022 178.086000 184.168625 i think you're right um in your opinion good or bad or both
sw3597B-ms98-a-0023 184.168625 198.890000 [silence]
sw3597B-ms98-a-0024 198.890000 203.386750 i do too [noise] i think part of that
sw3597B-ms98-a-0025 203.386750 210.021625 i- i don't know i think the role of women changing has been good in that women are feeling like
sw3597B-ms98-a-0026 210.021625 223.085375 i[n]- in terms of their self confident confidence their self-worth you know i can do something i can be somebody you know if i put my mind to it i can accomplish things too and i think that's good but um
sw3597B-ms98-a-0027 223.085375 233.028875 i think when you push you know maybe i think when that was first trying come about with you know what we know as the women's lib movement [noise] i think it was too extreme um
sw3597B-ms98-a-0028 233.028875 242.179125 i think you can be feminine and still be all those other things too you know and i think there's definite roles and i think you know part of the break up of the family
sw3597B-ms98-a-0029 242.179125 247.730625 maybe it's because of the the the social changes i don't know the fact that ah
sw3597B-ms98-a-0030 247.730625 254.056625 during their early changes where you know women did come more
sw3597B-ms98-a-0031 254.056625 265.759000 speak may[be]- maybe speak out i was gonna say come more out of themselves but speak out i think a lot of men were threatened by that i think now less men are you know because they're used to it it's around them_1 um
sw3597B-ms98-a-0032 265.759000 270.183125 but i i don't know i i
sw3597B-ms98-a-0033 270.183125 279.030875 i don't know why the families are breaking up i think that may go back to what you said a minute ago about people not being responsible for themselves or their actions because it's like
sw3597B-ms98-a-0034 279.030875 284.991875 they don't go into the marriage with a commitment that this is gonna work they go in and say well hey you know
sw3597B-ms98-a-0035 284.991875 288.092625 i'll stick with it while it's good and then i'll get out
sw3597B-ms98-a-0036 288.092625 295.097375 and i i- i think that directly affects the effort that you put into that marriage or that commitment
sw3597B-ms98-a-0037 295.097375 298.946000 [silence]
