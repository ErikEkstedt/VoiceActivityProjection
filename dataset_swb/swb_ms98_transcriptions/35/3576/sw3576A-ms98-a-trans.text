sw3576A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.510875 [noise]
sw3576A-ms98-a-0002 0.510875 36.497875 [silence]
sw3576A-ms98-a-0003 36.497875 40.073250 [laughter] well we have it just opposite here
sw3576A-ms98-a-0004 40.073250 47.052625 my wife works in you know at at at the TI and she's uh sedentary all day long
sw3576A-ms98-a-0005 47.052625 49.895500 so when she gets home she likes to mow
sw3576A-ms98-a-0006 49.895500 54.835000 and we have about ten acres and she tries to mow about half of it [noise]
sw3576A-ms98-a-0007 54.835000 56.654500 [silence]
sw3576A-ms98-a-0008 56.654500 64.485000 well yeah it keeps uh well it's doing real well because when we got this place the the dirt was just overgrazed
sw3576A-ms98-a-0009 64.485000 67.142125 i mean you know it was bare dirt in a lot of places
sw3576A-ms98-a-0010 67.142125 72.214250 and now you know since we've been mowing it and you know of course we water a little bit
sw3576A-ms98-a-0011 72.214250 75.039500 but that's just too much to water all at once but
sw3576A-ms98-a-0012 75.039500 80.686000 but just by keeping it mowed and getting it mulched in we've reclaimed a lot of it
sw3576A-ms98-a-0013 80.686000 90.821250 yeah but we don't do much in the way of uh flowers we have one little flower garden that we that we work with the rest of it is just like wild flowers
sw3576A-ms98-a-0014 90.821250 95.190375 and in the summertime we get the prettiest yellow flowers
sw3576A-ms98-a-0015 95.190375 99.674000 they're about oh i guess a third the size of your palm of your hand
sw3576A-ms98-a-0016 99.674000 100.895250 and
sw3576A-ms98-a-0017 100.895250 104.951625 of course in the spring we get the bluebonnets and Indian paintbrush
sw3576A-ms98-a-0018 104.951625 121.080000 [silence]
sw3576A-ms98-a-0019 121.080000 124.332125 yeah well my wife and i really enjoy that sort of thing
sw3576A-ms98-a-0020 124.332125 128.142250 uh she enjoys mowing i can't believe it
sw3576A-ms98-a-0021 128.142250 130.498250 i mean i hate it [laughter]
sw3576A-ms98-a-0022 130.498250 148.350250 [silence]
sw3576A-ms98-a-0023 148.350250 150.047625 right yeah
sw3576A-ms98-a-0024 150.047625 154.053125 [silence]
sw3576A-ms98-a-0025 154.053125 157.964375 [laughter] we don't even have any concrete or asphalt
sw3576A-ms98-a-0026 157.964375 176.913375 [silence]
sw3576A-ms98-a-0027 176.913375 187.657625 yeah but you know we do everything together this this spring we got a thousand pine trees from the actually this fall what am i talking about two weeks ago
sw3576A-ms98-a-0028 187.657625 191.825000 we got a thousand pine trees from the you know soil and conservation people
sw3576A-ms98-a-0029 191.825000 196.205750 and uh we're in the process of of planting
sw3576A-ms98-a-0030 196.205750 200.411500 and we're building a stand uh just to the north
sw3576A-ms98-a-0031 200.411500 205.188750 of our house and along the east uh property line 
sw3576A-ms98-a-0032 205.188750 210.165625 and i uh i think what we're what we're trying to do is create sort of a wind break
sw3576A-ms98-a-0033 210.165625 214.661250 because i'll tell you in winter time when that w[ind]- when that wind comes out of the north
sw3576A-ms98-a-0034 214.661250 218.193875 it just cuts right through you like you're not even there
sw3576A-ms98-a-0035 218.193875 219.569875 so
sw3576A-ms98-a-0036 219.569875 229.299375 on the other side of the house though that's where we have all the the delicate flowers and the mums and we have morning glory and we have trumpet vine and moon flowers
sw3576A-ms98-a-0037 229.299375 238.186250 and we planted those out by the septic so that uh they get plenty of water and we get hummingbirds come in the spring you know all summer long
sw3576A-ms98-a-0038 238.186250 239.210875 [silence]
