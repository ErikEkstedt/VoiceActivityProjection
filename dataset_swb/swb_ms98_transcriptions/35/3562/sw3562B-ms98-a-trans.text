sw3562B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.128750 [noise]
sw3562B-ms98-a-0002 0.128750 2.038250 okay well you you start it
sw3562B-ms98-a-0003 2.038250 16.022250 [silence]
sw3562B-ms98-a-0004 16.022250 17.023625 uh-huh
sw3562B-ms98-a-0005 17.023625 28.022000 [silence]
sw3562B-ms98-a-0006 28.022000 37.754875 sure uh unfortunately what that's done is it's put everybody in a terrible position because it used to be that one person could work whether it a man or a woman 
sw3562B-ms98-a-0007 37.754875 49.758625 okay now we're in a situation where uh it or at least it seems that maybe it's the economy or maybe it's just uh you know employers taking advantage of the fact that women want to work
sw3562B-ms98-a-0008 49.758625 55.441250 and now that they've made it or at least seems that like two people have to work in order to uh
sw3562B-ms98-a-0009 55.441250 62.304500 in order to afford to live you know but uh i think it's it's great i mean my wife works uh
sw3562B-ms98-a-0010 62.304500 69.465750 [silence]
sw3562B-ms98-a-0011 69.465750 74.332500 yeah it's true it's true what they say like women get sixty seven cents to the dollar
sw3562B-ms98-a-0012 74.332500 77.173125 that men make doing the same job that's that's terrible
sw3562B-ms98-a-0013 77.173125 79.412500 but i i think that'll change too
sw3562B-ms98-a-0014 79.412500 88.001000 [noise]
sw3562B-ms98-a-0015 88.001000 88.997750 yeah
sw3562B-ms98-a-0016 88.997750 93.862625 [silence]
sw3562B-ms98-a-0017 93.862625 101.394500 no that's why now every every woman i know works uh even my mother who didn't work for a while is back working now
sw3562B-ms98-a-0018 101.394500 102.772125 um
sw3562B-ms98-a-0019 102.772125 113.160875 except with the few exceptions of people that are unemployed which is unfortunate lately um every woman i know works my wife took some time off after we had our uh ch[ild]- our first child
sw3562B-ms98-a-0020 113.160875 119.461750 um but even that she's planned on getting work which good for her is she works in a profession that she could get work at home 
sw3562B-ms98-a-0021 119.461750 120.870875 so she's going to
sw3562B-ms98-a-0022 120.870875 122.641250 so we don't have to do the
sw3562B-ms98-a-0023 122.641250 126.469500 yeah she's an editor so she gets to do that and my sister
sw3562B-ms98-a-0024 126.469500 127.495500 an editor
sw3562B-ms98-a-0025 127.495500 129.598750 like in publishing yeah
sw3562B-ms98-a-0026 129.598750 130.716000 [vocalized-noise]
sw3562B-ms98-a-0027 130.716000 133.697000 she could do that at home so that's good uh 
sw3562B-ms98-a-0028 133.697000 137.343875 [silence]
sw3562B-ms98-a-0029 137.343875 148.089500 yeah i think that's the dilemma un[fortunately]- un[fortunately]- unfortunately my wife is in a profession that is uh relatively high amount of women in in publishing
sw3562B-ms98-a-0030 148.089500 154.617250 uh and it just so happens or maybe doesn't so happen that it's not a very high paying field
sw3562B-ms98-a-0031 154.617250 165.528250 now maybe that's because there's a lot of women in it like you're saying women are underpaid uh the amount of money that she was making didn't didn't make it worth her while to uh you know
sw3562B-ms98-a-0032 165.528250 169.011500 not be home pay for a babysitter or day care
sw3562B-ms98-a-0033 169.011500 172.123625 uh you know say that an[d]- and on top of the fact that
sw3562B-ms98-a-0034 172.123625 173.190750 [silence]
sw3562B-ms98-a-0035 173.190750 176.622750 sure sure that on top of the fact that that uh
sw3562B-ms98-a-0036 176.622750 181.793000 uh she can do some work at home that that it makes it makes it a perfect fit but
sw3562B-ms98-a-0037 181.793000 186.245875 [silence]
sw3562B-ms98-a-0038 186.245875 187.565250 yeah or to have
sw3562B-ms98-a-0039 187.565250 188.767125 [silence]
sw3562B-ms98-a-0040 188.767125 192.063250 or or have day care at the work place one or the other
sw3562B-ms98-a-0041 192.063250 199.716375 uh but unfortunate it's like that's not doing too well i know a lot of lot of lot of times it's the opposite though a lot of times
sw3562B-ms98-a-0042 199.716375 201.073250 um
sw3562B-ms98-a-0043 201.073250 204.083250 men stay home and the women women go to work
sw3562B-ms98-a-0044 204.083250 206.418875 which i think is good if you're not breast feeding
sw3562B-ms98-a-0045 206.418875 209.254125 [vocalized-noise]
sw3562B-ms98-a-0046 209.254125 210.266750 yeah
sw3562B-ms98-a-0047 210.266750 211.682375 [silence]
sw3562B-ms98-a-0048 211.682375 224.482750 no i i i've known a few people and i've read uh about others you know just like articles and stuff about other people doing it i certainly would do it uh i have no problem with that unfortunately i'm paid a lot more than my wife so it wouldn't be worth it
sw3562B-ms98-a-0049 224.482750 227.002000 um for our family but i
sw3562B-ms98-a-0050 227.002000 229.848250 [silence]
sw3562B-ms98-a-0051 229.848250 231.219750 um
sw3562B-ms98-a-0052 231.219750 235.356750 well i think as as time as time goes on women will um
sw3562B-ms98-a-0053 235.356750 247.122875 definitely have a better better better role in the work place i think that you know the first wave of women in the work place in any substantial degree was in you know like in the seventies and eighties
sw3562B-ms98-a-0054 247.122875 256.752625 and i think as women take on um roles of uh more importance in in jobs and and also again not to sounds
sw3562B-ms98-a-0055 256.752625 258.184125 i don't want to sound like
sw3562B-ms98-a-0056 258.184125 271.999000 you know like i like i think it's hard but i mean a lot of times women were given jobs because they were women you know and i think once once it evens out so that women get the jobs that they deserve and get the pay that they deserve which will often be
sw3562B-ms98-a-0057 271.999000 278.113625 powerful positions where there will be less discrimination in hiring when they hopefully when they hire
sw3562B-ms98-a-0058 278.113625 279.094375 you know
sw3562B-ms98-a-0059 279.094375 286.971125 [silence]
sw3562B-ms98-a-0060 286.971125 288.207000 yeah but that's
sw3562B-ms98-a-0061 288.207000 289.287875 [silence]
sw3562B-ms98-a-0062 289.287875 290.783125 that's why not the case
sw3562B-ms98-a-0063 290.783125 294.388875 [silence]
sw3562B-ms98-a-0064 294.388875 295.778000 sudden
sw3562B-ms98-a-0065 295.778000 298.754000 why would it be fair earlier i mean you know
