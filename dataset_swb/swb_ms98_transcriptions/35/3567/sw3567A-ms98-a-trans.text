sw3567A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 8.761125 [noise] okay Scott let's uh talk about advice that we can offer a parent where the child is going to go to a university and
sw3567A-ms98-a-0002 8.761125 20.353125 i have some yes some children i have three boys and they're all quite young and so we want to plan for their education w[e're]- we're saving right now and we're getting
sw3567A-ms98-a-0003 20.353125 29.165500 bonds and and uh and hopefully finances set aside so that they can choose a college that they want to how about yourself do you have any kids
sw3567A-ms98-a-0004 29.165500 30.201375 [silence]
sw3567A-ms98-a-0005 30.201375 37.879500 [laughter-so] so i imagine you've gone through the experience yourself of selecting your college your own college
sw3567A-ms98-a-0006 37.879500 43.871500 [silence]
sw3567A-ms98-a-0007 43.871500 49.943250 [laughter-very] good what uh what do you use as a basis to determine which college or university you go to
sw3567A-ms98-a-0008 49.943250 59.409750 [silence]
sw3567A-ms98-a-0009 59.409750 60.554375 um-hum
sw3567A-ms98-a-0010 60.554375 70.022875 [silence]
sw3567A-ms98-a-0011 70.022875 71.402500 um-hum
sw3567A-ms98-a-0012 71.402500 74.030750 [silence]
sw3567A-ms98-a-0013 74.030750 77.143500 [laughter-yeah] [laughter-wh[at]-] what you thought huh [noise] 
sw3567A-ms98-a-0014 77.143500 89.778250 [silence]
sw3567A-ms98-a-0015 89.778250 91.853000 just the degree itself
sw3567A-ms98-a-0016 91.853000 105.932625 well that's a that's that's good because i did quite a bit the same thing in my undergraduate work i wanted to get a school that was small enough that was personable that you didn't have a lecture w[ith]- uh hall with about
sw3567A-ms98-a-0017 105.932625 110.038750 fifteen other students competing for the professor's attention
sw3567A-ms98-a-0018 110.038750 117.316375 and uh but you i felt that i got a a pretty good uh undergraduate um
sw3567A-ms98-a-0019 117.316375 121.958625 i went to Utah State University which is in Logan Utah
sw3567A-ms98-a-0020 121.958625 126.376375 and the nice thing about it too is i knew that i wanted to get into business
sw3567A-ms98-a-0021 126.376375 136.242000 and that their business College of Business was accredited and well known at least there in the State of Utah and around the surrounding states and so forth
sw3567A-ms98-a-0022 136.242000 147.368375 and so i i felt like number one you nee[d]- you also need to to see what kind of name the like you mentioned before the name the college and university can can give you 
sw3567A-ms98-a-0023 147.368375 152.234250 and another thing that uh another reason why i chose that
sw3567A-ms98-a-0024 152.234250 161.518625 was the the finances i wanted to make sure that i would be able to afford it that i wouldn't get through four three years of of the undergraduate work and and have to leave
sw3567A-ms98-a-0025 161.518625 163.260500 and uh
sw3567A-ms98-a-0026 163.260500 171.029375 so i did a lot of talking with friends with family with uh counselors at high school and also read some
sw3567A-ms98-a-0027 171.029375 174.969125 some books on on the subject at the at the library
sw3567A-ms98-a-0028 174.969125 178.048875 and uh it was kind of unusual because my
sw3567A-ms98-a-0029 178.048875 184.310125 my two older brothers and i all went to thr[ee]- three different universities depending upon what our choice was so
sw3567A-ms98-a-0030 184.310125 185.656250 [laughter]
sw3567A-ms98-a-0031 185.656250 192.383125 hopefully we we chose the one that was best for us and i i felt very comfortable and good about that so i
sw3567A-ms98-a-0032 192.383125 203.178875 [silence]
sw3567A-ms98-a-0033 203.178875 209.523375 i don't think so [laughter] i don't know the the way that tuition is increasing um
sw3567A-ms98-a-0034 209.523375 220.741875 exponentially it's it's [laughter] it's kind of hard to set aside money and have that money grow [vocalized-noise] same pace that the college tuition is increasing i uh
sw3567A-ms98-a-0035 220.741875 223.606250 [silence]
sw3567A-ms98-a-0036 223.606250 231.762875 [laughter] and that the your children can use the benefits of that university well that that's an excellent idea that's an excellent idea
sw3567A-ms98-a-0037 231.762875 239.646625 one thing that uh that we did uh and my parents and our family is that we weren't able to afford
sw3567A-ms98-a-0038 239.646625 240.983500 um
sw3567A-ms98-a-0039 240.983500 248.946875 the kind of education that we all desired so my parents stressed that we get excellent grades and that we apply and try for scholarships
sw3567A-ms98-a-0040 248.946875 256.166875 and uh scholarships were very beneficial in my case to help pay for my education because my parents couldn't
sw3567A-ms98-a-0041 256.166875 266.747500 and what these scholarship could not supply i was able to to work for and and save and and and get also my my brother um
sw3567A-ms98-a-0042 266.747500 278.317125 he's a he's a medical doctor right now he had to you know once he got past his undergraduate and graduate degree he had to take out some loans and he's he's working to pay those off
sw3567A-ms98-a-0043 278.317125 280.433375 so i i think that the uh
sw3567A-ms98-a-0044 280.433375 291.553000 you know once you get past uh the initial stages of it that there's different options you can use and and uh the student loans are are a good option and
sw3567A-ms98-a-0045 291.553000 292.990125 [silence]
sw3567A-ms98-a-0046 292.990125 299.042000 [laughter-yeah] yes and and as you're well aware that tuition's not ch[eap]-
