sw3549A-ms98-a-0027 121.470500 125.456000 [silence]
sw3549A-ms98-a-0028 125.456000 129.971125 it's just like a pig i mean you know uh it has a lot less fat
sw3549A-ms98-a-0029 129.971125 134.520375 uh th[is]- this wild boar weighed probably about three hundred and thirty pounds

sw3549A-ms98-a-0039 173.761125 178.285500 brisket it's a part of the cow that they used to throw away
sw3549A-ms98-a-0040 178.285500 180.877625 it's just tough as a boot
sw3549A-ms98-a-0041 180.877625 185.311500 and uh you know they used to use it for leather i [laughter-think] [laughter]
sw3549A-ms98-a-0042 185.311500 187.450500 no i mean no i'm just kidding
sw3549A-ms98-a-0043 187.450500 192.349375 [noise] but uh it's it's a part of the loin you know the the rib cage 
sw3549A-ms98-a-0044 192.349375 197.454875 and it has a lot of muscles in it and a lot of gristle where it attaches to the ribs
sw3549A-ms98-a-0045 197.454875 203.857000 so it's really really a tough piece of meat but it's so tasty you can't stand it
sw3549A-ms98-a-0046 203.857000 207.891750 so you just take it and you marinate it for a couple of days
sw3549A-ms98-a-0047 207.891750 209.469625 and
sw3549A-ms98-a-0048 209.469625 210.595125 [vocalized-noise]
sw3549A-ms98-a-0049 210.595125 211.622375 [silence]

sw3549A-ms98-a-0063 268.040250 275.177375 you know where where we are it's it's it's uh the edge of the desert i mean it's part of the Great Plains
sw3549A-ms98-a-0064 275.177375 282.228750 so in the day time in the summer it goes up to a hundred a hundred and ten at night it goes down to about sixty
sw3549A-ms98-a-0065 282.228750 286.782000 yeah we get a fifty de[gree]- degree temperature swing in about four hours
