sw3502B-ms98-a-0002 4.915125 7.138250 oh
sw3502B-ms98-a-0003 7.138250 18.464250 one thing that i look for is um well maybe not the m[ost]- most important thing but benefits like um
sw3502B-ms98-a-0004 18.464250 19.921250 [silence]
sw3502B-ms98-a-0005 19.921250 22.841375 health insurance for my family
sw3502B-ms98-a-0006 22.841375 27.970250 and another thing would be um
sw3502B-ms98-a-0007 27.970250 29.968375 [silence]
sw3502B-ms98-a-0008 29.968375 35.687000 r[easonable]- reasonable work hours uh good working environment
sw3502B-ms98-a-0009 35.687000 37.474125 um
sw3502B-ms98-a-0010 37.474125 40.516375 [silence]
sw3502B-ms98-a-0011 40.516375 48.701250 right now i think it's we're supposed to talk about uh our current situation i'm a post doctoral fellow and
sw3502B-ms98-a-0012 48.701250 52.540250 a post doctoral [noise] fellow um i
sw3502B-ms98-a-0013 52.540250 57.127625 i'm it's for the training beyond your doctorate degree
sw3502B-ms98-a-0014 57.127625 59.607750 and
sw3502B-ms98-a-0015 59.607750 65.998250 i get the same benefits as the [vocalized-noise] staff at the university i work at the University of Iowa
sw3502B-ms98-a-0016 65.998250 67.415625 [silence]
sw3502B-ms98-a-0017 67.415625 68.994750 and
sw3502B-ms98-a-0018 68.994750 74.726375 i- i like i like working at the University one of the benefits there is you get
sw3502B-ms98-a-0019 74.726375 84.284250 [noise] a lot of flexibility in when you work and when you wanna take time off for example this Christmas i have about three weeks that i get to go out west to visit my family
sw3502B-ms98-a-0020 84.284250 91.252750 and so that's pretty good y[ou]- it would probably be hard to have something like that in another type of job
sw3502B-ms98-a-0021 91.252750 95.859250 [silence]
sw3502B-ms98-a-0022 95.859250 109.839000 oh yeah besides just s[ome]- besides some semester breaks th[e]- there is also other um [noise] other times too um [noise] like during the summer and things like that
sw3502B-ms98-a-0023 109.839000 118.245875 [silence]
sw3502B-ms98-a-0024 118.245875 125.546375 oh yes and that's one of the reasons [laughter-i] [laughter-like] the University too because_1 you do get credit for your own work um [noise]
sw3502B-ms98-a-0025 125.546375 131.770875 my ad[visor]- my mentor here es[pecially]- especially he used to work in industry but he couldn't stand it because
sw3502B-ms98-a-0026 131.770875 142.994875 um [noise] he felt like that his boss at uh at this aero[space]- p[lace]- space company where he worked uh his supervisor got credit for all the um achievements that he made
sw3502B-ms98-a-0027 142.994875 146.561875 so that's why he came back to the University
sw3502B-ms98-a-0028 146.561875 148.036125 and
sw3502B-ms98-a-0029 148.036125 150.142375 [silence]
sw3502B-ms98-a-0030 150.142375 159.810375 so i think at the University you get of[ten]- get credit for m[ore]- you know your name gets on what you do like when you publish articles and things like that
sw3502B-ms98-a-0031 159.810375 165.194375 um [noise] it's in physics however um
sw3502B-ms98-a-0032 165.194375 172.816000 [noise] you know there is s[everal]- several branches within physics i- i studied sound acoust[ics]- and the subject for that is called acoustics
sw3502B-ms98-a-0033 172.816000 184.007250 and i'm specifically interested in the acoustics of speech i'm working now at the N[ational]- National Center for Voice and Speech that's located here at the University of Iowa
sw3502B-ms98-a-0034 184.007250 187.356625 [silence]
sw3502B-ms98-a-0035 187.356625 199.351125 oh i found out about it because i attended um [noise] a conference for the Acoustical Society of America in Texas and uh [noise] the chairman of the session where i presented a paper um
sw3502B-ms98-a-0036 199.351125 211.574250 um was it Mister Godfrey [laughter-he] [laughter-um] was uh [noise] he he he gave me a a thing and said to try and find others to help join for this project
sw3502B-ms98-a-0037 211.574250 216.954375 [silence]
sw3502B-ms98-a-0038 216.954375 219.694625 oh i couldn't say that
sw3502B-ms98-a-0039 219.694625 220.971250 um
sw3502B-ms98-a-0040 220.971250 222.157750 [silence]
sw3502B-ms98-a-0041 222.157750 225.035250 i- i don't get a the salary for one thing
sw3502B-ms98-a-0042 225.035250 235.814375 nor the job stability p[ost]- a p[ost]- post doctoral fellow is only for two years but the ultimate goal usually of a post doctoral fellowship is probably to go on and accept a position at a University
sw3502B-ms98-a-0043 235.814375 237.574375 so this is
sw3502B-ms98-a-0044 237.574375 248.406000 um [noise] you know the economy with the Gulf War and everything um last year around the time i was graduating um there -[wa]s just were not very many opportunities available
sw3502B-ms98-a-0045 248.406000 261.236125 so this was the best thing because_1 um my post doctoral fellowship like this um um is a good thing on your resume for when you apply to be a professor or something like that
sw3502B-ms98-a-0046 261.236125 275.816500 [silence]
sw3502B-ms98-a-0047 275.816500 285.490000 uh yeah especially uh with the humidity here in Iowa yes i- i- i would uh definitely want a indoors job
sw3502B-ms98-a-0048 285.490000 290.135000 um [noise] do you have a um
sw3502B-ms98-a-0049 290.135000 298.530000 [silence]
