sw3564A-ms98-a-0023 85.434750 91.282375 before uh i was transfered [vocalized-noise] down to Houston in uh nineteen ninety
sw3564A-ms98-a-0024 91.282375 100.593250 and uh [noise] Dallas got hotter i mean temperature wise but i [vocalized-noise] you know Houston can get just as uncomfortable

sw3564A-ms98-a-0026 101.750625 104.901875 for some reason an[d]- and i guess it's uh
sw3564A-ms98-a-0027 104.901875 115.100625 not having just the extreme heat i mean we had uh one one year we had in in Dallas uh a you know i guess a week or more where it never got
