sw3508A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 3.195500 [noise] -[we]ll i guess we're supposed to talk about what's being done about recycling
sw3508A-ms98-a-0002 3.195500 5.220625 well lots right
sw3508A-ms98-a-0003 5.220625 7.888750 [laughter] finally
sw3508A-ms98-a-0004 7.888750 9.803750 [silence]
sw3508A-ms98-a-0005 9.803750 22.307375 well we have saved our newspapers for years and years because the uh Boy Scouts our boys have been involved in have uh had a huge recycling bin [noise] over at Resurrection Lutheran Church
sw3508A-ms98-a-0006 22.307375 24.447250 and um
sw3508A-ms98-a-0007 24.447250 33.483000 so we've done that for quite some time but since the price of paper has gone down like it's about a fifth of what it used to be
sw3508A-ms98-a-0008 33.483000 37.931000 so the Boy Scout troop quit doing it when the city took it over
sw3508A-ms98-a-0009 37.931000 44.036000 so now we just put ours out for the city of Plano do you live in Plano okay yeah
sw3508A-ms98-a-0010 44.036000 45.099750 you
sw3508A-ms98-a-0011 45.099750 47.368625 [silence]
sw3508A-ms98-a-0012 47.368625 48.766500 right
sw3508A-ms98-a-0013 48.766500 58.460000 yes although just just about a week ago some of my volunteer mothers that um work in the library for me said they hadn't gotten theirs
sw3508A-ms98-a-0014 58.460000 60.008875 [silence]
sw3508A-ms98-a-0015 60.008875 61.541250 yeah
sw3508A-ms98-a-0016 61.541250 62.896875 like
sw3508A-ms98-a-0017 62.896875 64.442250 yeah yeah
sw3508A-ms98-a-0018 64.442250 69.615125 [silence]
sw3508A-ms98-a-0019 69.615125 71.107750 uh-huh
sw3508A-ms98-a-0020 71.107750 73.403875 [silence]
sw3508A-ms98-a-0021 73.403875 76.222250 right yeah we used to take ours there
sw3508A-ms98-a-0022 76.222250 77.394125 [silence]
sw3508A-ms98-a-0023 77.394125 78.956750 [laughter-i] [laughter-know] 
sw3508A-ms98-a-0024 78.956750 80.480750 [silence]
sw3508A-ms98-a-0025 80.480750 84.592750 right right i'm really glad they do it um
sw3508A-ms98-a-0026 84.592750 94.701500 yeah i do news[papers]- mostly newspapers and um plastic two liter diet Coke bottles [laughter] and aluminum cans some but i don't use as many of those
sw3508A-ms98-a-0027 94.701500 102.851125 i guess the ones that are hard to convince yourself to do are the ones that you have to really that are really dirty that you have to wash [laughter-out] 
sw3508A-ms98-a-0028 102.851125 108.328750 [silence]
sw3508A-ms98-a-0029 108.328750 110.451875 uh ha
sw3508A-ms98-a-0030 110.451875 114.621625 wasting all your time and effort and putting it in there
sw3508A-ms98-a-0031 114.621625 117.006625 [silence]
sw3508A-ms98-a-0032 117.006625 119.092750 yeah yeah
sw3508A-ms98-a-0033 119.092750 122.565000 [silence]
sw3508A-ms98-a-0034 122.565000 124.823500 got your routine down yeah
sw3508A-ms98-a-0035 124.823500 135.149625 well i guess there are some places um in the north in particular that um have a real definite way of encouraging you to recycle because they charge you
sw3508A-ms98-a-0036 135.149625 139.676875 let's see they charge you for your garbage pick up by the weight
sw3508A-ms98-a-0037 139.676875 144.370625 so if you recycle things of course then you don't have all that weight in there
sw3508A-ms98-a-0038 144.370625 146.513750 [silence]
sw3508A-ms98-a-0039 146.513750 148.730750 right that's right
sw3508A-ms98-a-0040 148.730750 151.398375 yeah yeah
sw3508A-ms98-a-0041 151.398375 166.665250 [silence]
sw3508A-ms98-a-0042 166.665250 167.978875 hm
sw3508A-ms98-a-0043 167.978875 169.753875 [silence]
sw3508A-ms98-a-0044 169.753875 171.134375 right
sw3508A-ms98-a-0045 171.134375 175.807000 [silence]
sw3508A-ms98-a-0046 175.807000 180.584875 [laughter-yeah] [laughter-right] probably going to throw them in your trash [laughter]
sw3508A-ms98-a-0047 180.584875 184.074625 well there are places that take car batteries but i wonder if they would take
sw3508A-ms98-a-0048 184.074625 192.552125 i mean not that it would [laughter] kind of a pain to you know drive over somewhere special just for that for two little tiny batteries but
sw3508A-ms98-a-0049 192.552125 195.132375 [silence]
sw3508A-ms98-a-0050 195.132375 196.950250 yeah that's true
sw3508A-ms98-a-0051 196.950250 203.261375 [silence]
sw3508A-ms98-a-0052 203.261375 206.073250 right that's true um
sw3508A-ms98-a-0053 206.073250 210.532875 when i was home those few days around Thanksgiving and the um
sw3508A-ms98-a-0054 210.532875 225.003250 the truck came by well we all ran out to watch it because you know we'd never [laughter-really] seen it pick up our stuff and one thing i thought was interesting was that the driver had something on his belt that he uh scanned across the little bar code on our bin 
sw3508A-ms98-a-0055 225.003250 232.594625 as soon as he took the stuff and he just pulled this thing kind of out of his pocket and just you know scanned it so i don't know why what that was reading it for
sw3508A-ms98-a-0056 232.594625 240.765500 but um they must be trying to keep track of you know who is doing it or what i guess i don't know another
sw3508A-ms98-a-0057 240.765500 242.259500 [silence]
sw3508A-ms98-a-0058 242.259500 247.140875 oh for those who are really cooperating now that would encourage it
sw3508A-ms98-a-0059 247.140875 255.175500 [silence]
sw3508A-ms98-a-0060 255.175500 257.150875 sure sure
sw3508A-ms98-a-0061 257.150875 262.270125 but the garbage um now there is just one garbage man that comes
sw3508A-ms98-a-0062 262.270125 264.629125 on the truck instead of two
sw3508A-ms98-a-0063 264.629125 272.773875 so that's interesting um also slightly off the subject but our our big green garbage thing got stolen
sw3508A-ms98-a-0064 272.773875 274.050250 uh-huh
sw3508A-ms98-a-0065 274.050250 277.859125 and we [laughter] we called the city and um 
sw3508A-ms98-a-0066 277.859125 286.399375 they they brought us a new one and they did not charge us and they said that between three and four hundred have been stolen
sw3508A-ms98-a-0067 286.399375 290.475500 isn't that sad you know it just
sw3508A-ms98-a-0068 290.475500 300.482000 oh and they must be yeah really expensive i mean of course we were hoping we weren't we weren't going to have to pay for it you know but i mean what would somebody do with them
