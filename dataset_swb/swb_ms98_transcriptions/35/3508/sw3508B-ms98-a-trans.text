sw3508B-ms98-a-0018 57.790750 64.120875 oh that's why i asked you i guess it you know it does go in cycles and not everyone got theirs right away
sw3508B-ms98-a-0019 64.120875 74.405125 and i i was so relieved because i've been making a real concerted effort make you know recycling the aluminum and the newspapers and even got into plastic because Wal-Mart collected it
sw3508B-ms98-a-0020 74.405125 83.323000 and uh my garage was just getting overwhelmed and of course i didn't go weekly so it became quite a big thing and uh
sw3508B-ms98-a-0021 83.323000 89.700875 [silence]

sw3508B-ms98-a-0026 100.930750 108.969000 yeah well i found out after washing out many a peanut butter jar that they're not a recycling number one or two
sw3508B-ms98-a-0027 108.969000 112.357250 uh ha so it was wasting a lot of time
sw3508B-ms98-a-0028 112.357250 118.243625 yeah thinking i was safe in buying those jars as far as the environment was concerned
sw3508B-ms98-a-0029 118.243625 124.941250 but uh you know but it it's not that hard now that i've got this system under control yeah

sw3508B-ms98-a-0033 143.386875 153.046250 yeah i do find that i don't have as much to throw away because the all the bulky things are are being tossed in with the recycling and uh 
sw3508B-ms98-a-0034 153.046250 166.807875 i don't know what they could do more of exactly around here right now other than uh what are some of the things they don't recycle oh one thing i thought about the other day were batteries just everyday regular batteries
sw3508B-ms98-a-0035 166.807875 178.658375 supposedly you know leak and and contaminate the landfills and yet what am i going to do when i have a couple double A batteries to toss out and they don't take
sw3508B-ms98-a-0036 178.658375 181.701500 yeah that's what happens because

sw3508B-ms98-a-0040 191.149250 196.493625 yeah yeah but i think the city one could possibly look into that or something
sw3508B-ms98-a-0041 196.493625 205.388250 uh if they've got these bins for all the other little items i'm sure if p[eople]- people will have batteries uh you know quite often to to toss out
