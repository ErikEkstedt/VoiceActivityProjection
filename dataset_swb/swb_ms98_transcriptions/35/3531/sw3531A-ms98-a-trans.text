sw3531A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.239750 [noise] 
sw3531A-ms98-a-0002 0.239750 9.792750 uh [laughter] okay [laughter] all right i'll start uh funding 
sw3531A-ms98-a-0003 9.792750 18.811750 i think that in light of the seriousness of it of the fact that that uh by what uh
sw3531A-ms98-a-0004 18.811750 25.773125 i think they said by the year two thousand there'll be at least five is it five thousand a year or more
sw3531A-ms98-a-0005 25.773125 36.835000 uh yeah will be dying from it and i know uh what is it uh over in Africa it's just [vocalized-noise] already in horrendous uh
sw3531A-ms98-a-0006 36.835000 50.822375 yeah it really is so in light of that i think that that we're probably going to have to increase the funding for research i think that uh i don't know if they have it but it looks like to me that all the countries could go together
sw3531A-ms98-a-0007 50.822375 60.779625 and have like a joint AIDS research program i don't know if they already have one of those where everybody could put in their input
sw3531A-ms98-a-0008 60.779625 61.994750 [silence]
sw3531A-ms98-a-0009 61.994750 64.498875 i don't know
sw3531A-ms98-a-0010 64.498875 71.406250 i don't know i don't i don't hear about research that much except in the terms of what the United States is doing
sw3531A-ms98-a-0011 71.406250 78.560375 and the celebrities that sh[ow]- you know the benefits and things that they put on for AIDS research i do i did hear about uh
sw3531A-ms98-a-0012 78.560375 81.034000 Africa and um
sw3531A-ms98-a-0013 81.034000 83.725125 how rampant it is over there
sw3531A-ms98-a-0014 83.725125 93.574875 and i know uh in talking to i have a relative that works for uh state welfare in Oklahoma the AIDS children that are coming in with it
sw3531A-ms98-a-0015 93.574875 104.039875 uh it i mean it it's it's tragic it's just absolutely horrible and it's you know it's not just homosexuals it's you know heterosexuals it's you know the drug users it's
sw3531A-ms98-a-0016 104.039875 110.848750 innocent people that you know go in for blood transfusions so i mean it's starting to affect everyone
sw3531A-ms98-a-0017 110.848750 129.125000 [silence]
sw3531A-ms98-a-0018 129.125000 139.326875 i think that probably partly is it i think that it is has received so much more publicity since we have had well-known actors athletes
sw3531A-ms98-a-0019 139.326875 146.458875 everything coming down with it i think that uh i do agree with someone when uh Magic Johnson announced
sw3531A-ms98-a-0020 146.458875 150.828750 uh there was a uh spokesm[an]- -[spokes]person for the gay community
sw3531A-ms98-a-0021 150.828750 162.798750 that came out and said that you know it would not be receiving this much publicity if it wasn't for someone like Magic Johnson and it would be you know very interesting to see
sw3531A-ms98-a-0022 162.798750 172.885750 that's right that's right and i think it it i think it makes people more aware that it hits other than just the gay community and uh
sw3531A-ms98-a-0023 172.885750 175.368250 but i do think that that
sw3531A-ms98-a-0024 175.368250 184.872875 in light of the fact that it's going to hit all of us i think what are they saying by the year two thousand i think it's one in three is supposed to have it
sw3531A-ms98-a-0025 184.872875 190.741000 you know it it because it it is it's spreading so rapidly
sw3531A-ms98-a-0026 190.741000 219.072250 [silence]
sw3531A-ms98-a-0027 219.072250 222.380125 oh i didn't realize that
sw3531A-ms98-a-0028 222.380125 228.909500 [silence]
sw3531A-ms98-a-0029 228.909500 242.342250 well it is i know that i- i heard another conversation regarding AIDS the fact that that you know cancer is not receiving this and yet is is cancer growing at such a rapid rate
sw3531A-ms98-a-0030 242.342250 243.859750 [silence]
sw3531A-ms98-a-0031 243.859750 246.327750 you know it it
sw3531A-ms98-a-0032 246.327750 254.240000 you know and i think that's what is scaring people is that it is reaching such epidemic proportions you know where
sw3531A-ms98-a-0033 254.240000 258.371750 is is cancer on the r[ising]- is it rising as rapidly
sw3531A-ms98-a-0034 258.371750 262.863375 you know as for instance AIDS you know uh i[t]-
sw3531A-ms98-a-0035 262.863375 267.028500 i don't i don't know either you know it's it's just uh
sw3531A-ms98-a-0036 267.028500 274.114750 and granted i- i do think that because of the publicity and because of the people you know getting it and everything
sw3531A-ms98-a-0037 274.114750 282.403375 i think that that people are more aware of it than you know say if you know someone just dies with cancer which is it's a tragic way
sw3531A-ms98-a-0038 282.403375 286.524125 i mean you know it's tragic that it's that way
sw3531A-ms98-a-0039 286.524125 299.074000 [silence]
