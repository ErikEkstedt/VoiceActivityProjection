sw3541A-ms98-a-0003 0.983375 2.919875 you think you're getting your money's worth
sw3541A-ms98-a-0004 2.919875 3.980375 [silence]
sw3541A-ms98-a-0005 3.980375 9.469625 [laughter] i
sw3541A-ms98-a-0006 9.469625 13.977875 [silence]
sw3541A-ms98-a-0007 13.977875 18.009000 well that's probably the next year's agenda
sw3541A-ms98-a-0008 18.009000 21.438500 [silence]
sw3541A-ms98-a-0009 21.438500 29.411375 oh ye[ah]- they're finding the way the tax you every time you turn around and i- i think one way or the other we're gonna
sw3541A-ms98-a-0010 29.411375 33.960375 pay for the bureaucracy i guess
sw3541A-ms98-a-0011 33.960375 35.538500 and uh
sw3541A-ms98-a-0012 35.538500 42.422250 it's one area that's uh really i- i think hurting the economy more than anything i think the taxes have just
sw3541A-ms98-a-0013 42.422250 48.242500 every time you turn around they they have taking more bite out of the
sw3541A-ms98-a-0014 48.242500 54.143500 dollars that are available for spending for any kind of products and i- i- i think that is probably
sw3541A-ms98-a-0015 54.143500 57.848000 as big a item fueling the recession as anything
sw3541A-ms98-a-0016 57.848000 59.146875 right now
sw3541A-ms98-a-0017 59.146875 65.050250 [silence]
sw3541A-ms98-a-0018 65.050250 66.432625 that's right
sw3541A-ms98-a-0019 66.432625 68.329625 [silence]
sw3541A-ms98-a-0020 68.329625 69.471750 that's right
sw3541A-ms98-a-0021 69.471750 79.973500 [silence]
sw3541A-ms98-a-0022 79.973500 81.779500 yep that's right
sw3541A-ms98-a-0023 81.779500 89.497000 [silence]
sw3541A-ms98-a-0024 89.497000 97.064500 well i think that uh that the problem with the sales tax of course is it's an unfair tax across the board
sw3541A-ms98-a-0025 97.064500 104.390125 uh as far as ability to pay which a[llegedly]- allegedly allegedly taxes are supposed to be directed towards
sw3541A-ms98-a-0026 104.390125 107.485500 but uh now people with the
sw3541A-ms98-a-0027 107.485500 115.395750 lowest income pay a hundred percent almost of you know taxes on everything they buy
sw3541A-ms98-a-0028 115.395750 117.065125 and where people that make
sw3541A-ms98-a-0029 117.065125 123.771375 you know two hundred three hundred thousand dollars a year certainly a portion of that they aren't going to be paying taxes on you know
sw3541A-ms98-a-0030 123.771375 125.338375 and uh
sw3541A-ms98-a-0031 125.338375 134.189125 that's the unfair equity inequities of sales tax as a main source of revenue but i don't think it is anymore not in Texas anyway
sw3541A-ms98-a-0032 134.189125 138.422125 [silence]
sw3541A-ms98-a-0033 138.422125 140.540375 that's right that's right
sw3541A-ms98-a-0034 140.540375 141.796375 [silence]
sw3541A-ms98-a-0035 141.796375 143.881625 that's right that's right
sw3541A-ms98-a-0036 143.881625 147.818375 and that's the unfairness of the thing but uh
sw3541A-ms98-a-0037 147.818375 151.993875 i think taxes [laughter-generally] [laughter-are] [laughter-unfair] [laughter]
sw3541A-ms98-a-0038 151.993875 156.503125 [silence]
sw3541A-ms98-a-0039 156.503125 158.428000 well you know
sw3541A-ms98-a-0040 158.428000 162.764625 like other things if they don't affect you you don't worry about them too much
sw3541A-ms98-a-0041 162.764625 165.353625 [laughter] [laughter-i]
sw3541A-ms98-a-0042 165.353625 170.431500 i have trouble buying a twenty thousand dollar car still so uh it doesn't
sw3541A-ms98-a-0043 170.431500 172.442500 i- i think uh
sw3541A-ms98-a-0044 172.442500 173.542750 [silence]
sw3541A-ms98-a-0045 173.542750 179.436625 uh you know generally the prices of cars have gotten out of line which is uh you know and uh
sw3541A-ms98-a-0046 179.436625 184.694000 i guess if people got thirty forty thousand bucks to spend on a car uh that's their
sw3541A-ms98-a-0047 184.694000 193.472625 prerogative you know [laughter] i- i- i don't have a whole lot of [laughter-sympathy] [laughter-on] [laughter-that] y[ou]- you maybe you buy that you know and i don't mean to be knocking uh 
sw3541A-ms98-a-0048 193.472625 206.137250 [silence]
sw3541A-ms98-a-0049 206.137250 219.326500 yeah there are there are and the idea of that kind of taxation is to have people think twice on putting their money into that i guess you know unless they really want it buy something that
sw3541A-ms98-a-0050 219.326500 221.185125 you know
sw3541A-ms98-a-0051 221.185125 223.043625 more
sw3541A-ms98-a-0052 223.043625 229.255625 well it it's just like having taxes on or exemptions for kids you know it's a way of
sw3541A-ms98-a-0053 229.255625 237.295875 increasing the population that that was one of the initial ideas of you know giving exemptions on kids on on federal taxes
sw3541A-ms98-a-0054 237.295875 248.152375 and where you exempt things like uh uh one of the best things i heard on taxes to stimulate the economy someone brilliant deductor probably Lloyd Bentsen
sw3541A-ms98-a-0055 248.152375 261.862000 said that all you know if they gave back the ah deductions on credit cards on your federal taxes people would probably be you know spending more money using their credit cards
sw3541A-ms98-a-0056 261.862000 269.716625 now i don't know if that's true or not but if you look on all interest things not just credit cards but on your cars and you know a[ny]- any kind of
sw3541A-ms98-a-0057 269.716625 277.209375 interest that you're paying from a personal point of view that might make certain sense in stimulating consumer purchases
sw3541A-ms98-a-0058 277.209375 288.573000 so that's a lot of the games that politicians play on where they want to go you know tax things that they don't you know to a degree
sw3541A-ms98-a-0059 288.573000 293.538750 [noise] well like booze you know example they keep raising the taxes on booze it gets to the point
sw3541A-ms98-a-0060 293.538750 298.077000 you know it makes drunks sober you [laughter-know] [laughter-they] [laughter-quit] [laughter-buying] [laughter-anything] [laughter]
sw3541A-ms98-a-0061 298.077000 299.234000 [silence]
