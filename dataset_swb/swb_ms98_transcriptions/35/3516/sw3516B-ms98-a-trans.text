sw3516B-ms98-a-0003 5.369000 13.545375 uh well without a doubt uh [noise] one of the biggest problems with are automobiles i mean we've got you know uh i think
sw3516B-ms98-a-0004 13.545375 22.632250 probably we'd only be second to uh uh Los Angeles really as far as a a a major metropolitan area that's completely dependent upon
sw3516B-ms98-a-0005 22.632250 32.057500 automobiles there's just no real mass transit here and i think it's a a major drawback for Houston a a close runner up to that would be all of the uh
sw3516B-ms98-a-0006 32.057500 39.159125 uh petrochemical and uh oil industry plants that we have here uh
sw3516B-ms98-a-0007 39.159125 60.923625 [silence]
sw3516B-ms98-a-0008 60.923625 62.197875 right
sw3516B-ms98-a-0009 62.197875 78.593875 [silence]
sw3516B-ms98-a-0010 78.593875 79.724125 yeah
sw3516B-ms98-a-0011 79.724125 87.313750 [silence]
sw3516B-ms98-a-0012 87.313750 88.781750 you're kidding
sw3516B-ms98-a-0013 88.781750 89.554500 [laughter]
sw3516B-ms98-a-0014 89.554500 92.406000 [laughter] that's amazing that they still use coal
sw3516B-ms98-a-0015 92.406000 103.449375 [silence]
sw3516B-ms98-a-0016 103.449375 104.453125 yeah
sw3516B-ms98-a-0017 104.453125 105.806375 [silence]
sw3516B-ms98-a-0018 105.806375 108.207500 what part of Iowa do you live in now
sw3516B-ms98-a-0019 108.207500 111.654875 [silence]
sw3516B-ms98-a-0020 111.654875 113.221250 i've been through there
sw3516B-ms98-a-0021 113.221250 115.446500 yeah i've been through there before
sw3516B-ms98-a-0022 115.446500 116.826375 yeah is that
sw3516B-ms98-a-0023 116.826375 124.981750 [silence]
sw3516B-ms98-a-0024 124.981750 126.055375 uh-huh
sw3516B-ms98-a-0025 126.055375 128.004000 [silence]
sw3516B-ms98-a-0026 128.004000 139.480375 yeah now i've i've lived in this is the second time i've lived in Houston it's i've been i brought back here before uh the second just uh about a year and a half ago i was transferred back to Houston after being away for about six years
sw3516B-ms98-a-0027 139.480375 153.850500 and it's not i can't really say that it's any worse than it was as a matter of fact i think if anything a[nd]- the the air situation here might be a little bit better and i i think part of that has to do with uh the older cars are being phased off the road and the more modern
sw3516B-ms98-a-0028 153.850500 158.554625 uh models i think are uh you know pollute so much less
sw3516B-ms98-a-0029 158.554625 169.505125 uh you know with the unleaded gasoline and the fuel injection and uh the uh uh uh you know the little computer chips that monitor the way the engine runs i think we've got much cleaner
sw3516B-ms98-a-0030 169.505125 180.683500 burning automobiles now than certainly we had ten fifteen or twenty years ago but at the same time uh there's just only so much that you know you can take and
sw3516B-ms98-a-0031 180.683500 194.991625 i[t's]- it's i think eventually we're going to have to bite the bullet and invest in some sort of really good mass transit system whether it's rail monorail or or what but uh w[ell]- uh the the
sw3516B-ms98-a-0032 194.991625 200.115875 leaders and and the people too people just are not ready to give up their cars and i don't think that
sw3516B-ms98-a-0033 200.115875 205.851375 they're going to do that until it just becomes uh economically necessary for them to
sw3516B-ms98-a-0034 205.851375 225.123750 [silence]
sw3516B-ms98-a-0035 225.123750 226.285750 r[eally]-
sw3516B-ms98-a-0036 226.285750 227.207250 [silence]
sw3516B-ms98-a-0037 227.207250 229.510500 yeah really yeah
sw3516B-ms98-a-0038 229.510500 246.067875 [silence]
sw3516B-ms98-a-0039 246.067875 247.423250 yeah
sw3516B-ms98-a-0040 247.423250 249.012375 [silence]
sw3516B-ms98-a-0041 249.012375 263.458875 well and again and i think that's indicative of the general uh state of of things uh uh here in the US i think that unless uh again you're just forced to either by economy or just like you know a situation like you say where there's no parking available um
sw3516B-ms98-a-0042 263.458875 274.505750 um i th[ink]- i think that's r[eally]- really one of the few most people i don't think th[ere're]- th[ere're]- there're a few die hard people that will al[ways]- always commute uh and i i applaud them i think that's a great
sw3516B-ms98-a-0043 274.505750 287.056000 but uh i for one i'm just as guilty as the next person i want the convenience of going out there cranking up my car and driving to exactly where i want to go a[t]- at exactly the time i want to go and not have to be dependent upon any schedule
sw3516B-ms98-a-0044 287.056000 288.272625 so
sw3516B-ms98-a-0045 288.272625 289.523125 but uh
sw3516B-ms98-a-0046 289.523125 291.032000 [silence]
sw3516B-ms98-a-0047 291.032000 294.766125 anyway it's uh at least it's not Mexico City [laughter]
sw3516B-ms98-a-0048 294.766125 298.626000 [silence]
