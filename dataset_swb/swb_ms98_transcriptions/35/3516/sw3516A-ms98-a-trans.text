sw3516A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 6.197125 [noise] um what do you think is one of the major problems with air pollution in Houston
sw3516A-ms98-a-0002 6.197125 39.336250 [silence]
sw3516A-ms98-a-0003 39.336250 43.437750 i can't speak too much for Iowa i just moved here from
sw3516A-ms98-a-0004 43.437750 49.393250 Utah where i just graduated but um i know there cars were also um
sw3516A-ms98-a-0005 49.393250 61.670750 the major problem and the problem there in the mountainous region where we were surrounded by mountains um is we had these temperature inversions so in the um winter all the pollution was trapped in
sw3516A-ms98-a-0006 61.670750 66.572375 and so we had major pollution problems there particularly
sw3516A-ms98-a-0007 66.572375 79.623125 well not only from cars though we had things like T M tin from a local steel mill i mean that's continued running during you know whether or not we had the temperature inversions or not
sw3516A-ms98-a-0008 79.623125 89.651375 so um that was another big source and plus the university where i went also used coal for um all their heating purposes so
sw3516A-ms98-a-0009 89.651375 91.884375 [silence]
sw3516A-ms98-a-0010 91.884375 93.199375 so um
sw3516A-ms98-a-0011 93.199375 100.751875 so but [noise] th[ey're]- they're in the process of converting over but um at that time they um
sw3516A-ms98-a-0012 100.751875 106.145875 we're still using just coal for for their for their heating
sw3516A-ms98-a-0013 106.145875 108.027000 [silence]
sw3516A-ms98-a-0014 108.027000 109.516375 um
sw3516A-ms98-a-0015 109.516375 113.620000 um Iowa City Iowa i'm working at the university here
sw3516A-ms98-a-0016 113.620000 114.949125 [silence]
sw3516A-ms98-a-0017 114.949125 115.989125 oh
sw3516A-ms98-a-0018 115.989125 118.670875 well i was just in Houston also um
sw3516A-ms98-a-0019 118.670875 125.748750 um about a month ago with um the a conference for the Acoustical Society of America
sw3516A-ms98-a-0020 125.748750 128.792875 so uh uh and i enjoyed [laughter-Houston]
sw3516A-ms98-a-0021 128.792875 207.491375 [silence]
sw3516A-ms98-a-0022 207.491375 209.005875 yeah
sw3516A-ms98-a-0023 209.005875 219.151750 i know even in the small town university town the university is congested into the little downtown that we have but there's no place for anyone to park and uh
sw3516A-ms98-a-0024 219.151750 220.241250 [silence]
sw3516A-ms98-a-0025 220.241250 228.014250 even as staff in the university i cannot get parking so i'm forced to uh take the bus although buses pollute enough themselves too
sw3516A-ms98-a-0026 228.014250 240.046500 but but um i know i i cannot in Utah no one took the bus but here in [laughter-I[owa]-] in Iowa people are forced to take the bus to get to the university which i think is
sw3516A-ms98-a-0027 240.046500 246.993125 little bit interesting i mean it's a small university town but everything is just in this one area d[owntown]- in downtown so and there's no parking so
sw3516A-ms98-a-0028 246.993125 250.379375 anyway we're forced to um yeah
sw3516A-ms98-a-0029 250.379375 291.004875 [silence]
sw3516A-ms98-a-0030 291.004875 292.051000 yeah
sw3516A-ms98-a-0031 292.051000 295.243500 [silence]
sw3516A-ms98-a-0032 295.243500 298.626000 yeah um i w[ell]- one thing i thought though is
