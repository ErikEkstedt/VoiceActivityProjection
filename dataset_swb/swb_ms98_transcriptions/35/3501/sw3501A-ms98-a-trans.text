sw3501A-ms98-a-0045 195.111000 202.902250 we had a um our little bird we've only had it for about six months and we got that for my son for his birthday and
sw3501A-ms98-a-0046 202.902250 214.769625 it's named Buttercup a little yellow yellow parakeet [laughter] [laughter-yeah] they chose that and i one other pet we h[ad]- had an experience with over the summer it's a kind of a funny thing we
sw3501A-ms98-a-0047 214.769625 220.147750 [noise] my neighbor had given her children each a a a a bunny rabbit for Easter

sw3501A-ms98-a-0049 228.923250 237.917875 so we said yes we'll take them_1 and and take care of them_1 for a while and she said now you know when you don't want them_1 i know a man that just loves them_1 and he'll take them_1 anytime you want and
sw3501A-ms98-a-0050 237.917875 245.711750 we were a little bit reluctant with the cat and the bird already to take on some more [laughter] but so we took these three rabbits from them
sw3501A-ms98-a-0051 245.711750 253.321250 and about two weeks later um my son went out to feed them_1 and and he said mom i i think the white bunny's sick
sw3501A-ms98-a-0052 253.321250 262.054500 and so yeah we went out immediately and lifted up the hutch lid and that mama rabbit the white one
sw3501A-ms98-a-0053 262.054500 271.362000 had had eleven babies [laughter] uh yeah eleven oh so that was quite a surprise and
sw3501A-ms98-a-0054 271.362000 280.740125 so we went from three bunnies to fifteen in a matter of two weeks [laughter] but tha[t]- i guess that was her first time being a mother and i i'm not real
sw3501A-ms98-a-0055 280.740125 291.184875 knowledgeable about bunnies but they all died and i they all did and she well she didn't take care of them_1 and i've heard sometimes that with their first their first
