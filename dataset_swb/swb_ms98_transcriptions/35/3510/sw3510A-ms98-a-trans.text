sw3510A-ms98-a-0016 67.304125 74.774625 and it says basically that uh that this is probably just about the best one that they've ever done
sw3510A-ms98-a-0017 74.774625 77.469500 [silence]
sw3510A-ms98-a-0018 77.469500 86.596000 sure it finishes by if this is indeed the final voyage of the original crew Star Trek six is a worthy valediction

sw3510A-ms98-a-0027 133.503000 146.731625 this movie Hook is getting interesting reviews some are saying that it too sweet uh [vocalized-noise] just because they spent so much money on it and it's got such well-known stars i'm thinking about seeing it
sw3510A-ms98-a-0028 146.731625 148.906500 it's called Hook it's

sw3510A-ms98-a-0040 232.785375 234.626625 by watching on video
