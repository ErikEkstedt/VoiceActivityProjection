sw3537A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 3.872500 okay what do you think about uh this health insurance business
sw3537A-ms98-a-0002 3.872500 9.637875 [silence]
sw3537A-ms98-a-0003 9.637875 10.955500 um-hum
sw3537A-ms98-a-0004 10.955500 30.676250 [silence]
sw3537A-ms98-a-0005 30.676250 31.635375 [noise]
sw3537A-ms98-a-0006 31.635375 46.485000 [silence]
sw3537A-ms98-a-0007 46.485000 48.362000 well i uh
sw3537A-ms98-a-0008 48.362000 56.263250 i understand what you're saying and there's probably some truth to that i think that uh generally i don't
sw3537A-ms98-a-0009 56.263250 61.936500 welcome added government responsibilities however when a
sw3537A-ms98-a-0010 61.936500 69.412750 anybody can't police their own profession it eventually leads to that and i think the costs and the uh
sw3537A-ms98-a-0011 69.412750 82.246875 the way the medical profession has every year i being in my own business uh in the last six years every year there's been at least minimum twenty five percent increase in health insurance costs 
sw3537A-ms98-a-0012 82.246875 83.702250 and
sw3537A-ms98-a-0013 83.702250 95.143500 i think eventually the number of people that can afford health insurance a[s]- as it is now getting squeezed and squeezed tighter uh
sw3537A-ms98-a-0014 95.143500 99.550375 i think they're asking for it i- i think the medical profession is just
sw3537A-ms98-a-0015 99.550375 104.455875 just pushing until there's no option but the government take it over and uh
sw3537A-ms98-a-0016 104.455875 111.745125 [silence]
sw3537A-ms98-a-0017 111.745125 115.680625 well i- i think a lot of it is uh i- i don't
sw3537A-ms98-a-0018 115.680625 123.880500 disagree totally with that but uh my wife this last summer uh when we were on vacation tore up her knee and uh
sw3537A-ms98-a-0019 123.880500 134.655625 uh i[t]- it was lig[aments]- ligaments uh in her knee as it turned out uh she came back that uh we were out at Cape Hatteras when this happened and uh she got home
sw3537A-ms98-a-0020 134.655625 146.917000 and the leading orthopedic man who has handled football people for years and is as good as they come i mean he knows knee problems okay i mean if anyone does this guy knows it
sw3537A-ms98-a-0021 146.917000 157.061375 well she goes in and he says well i think this is what it is but uh you better go to the hospital and have one of these MRI things thousand dollars for this uh
sw3537A-ms98-a-0022 157.061375 158.164000 [silence]
sw3537A-ms98-a-0023 158.164000 167.721625 oh Magnetic uh Resonance uh Imaging type thing and my wife said well uh do i need that and h[e]- he says well uh
sw3537A-ms98-a-0024 167.721625 177.551125 you know i[t]- it'll help me diagnose this i mean uh you know i- i suggest you go have this thing insurance won't pick this up unless you're in the hospital
sw3537A-ms98-a-0025 177.551125 188.773125 now a thousand uh uh dollars for thirty five minutes i mean doctors routinely send people in for anything now for years they didn't have this and they solved these problem[s]-
sw3537A-ms98-a-0026 188.773125 201.131250 and you know i said to her well look you know if you feel you got to go go but i- i think a thousand dollars these guys i don't know what it is but there's no doubt they get kickbacks to fill these machines up night and day
sw3537A-ms98-a-0027 201.131250 211.030125 and even if they cost a hundred two hundred five hundred thousand dollars at uh roughly a thousand dollars every half hour uh that's ridiculous
sw3537A-ms98-a-0028 211.030125 215.581375 i- i don't care what anyone says tho[se]- you know the costs are not it's a picture
sw3537A-ms98-a-0029 215.581375 226.493500 it shouldn't cost more than thirty five bucks for something like that you know reasonableness but they aren't reasonable fifty a hundred dollars they don't have to pay them_1 back in three months time y[ou]- you know
sw3537A-ms98-a-0030 226.493500 237.230375 [silence]
sw3537A-ms98-a-0031 237.230375 250.027500 well i think that should be tha[t's]- that's a another problem but that's part of our legalese problem and that the government eventually will [laughter-address] [laughter-too] just you know because_1 it's out of control i- i agree with you
sw3537A-ms98-a-0032 250.027500 261.978000 you know uh i was on a jury or i- i didn't make the jury but there was a deal where a doctor was gonna be sued for malpractice on the death of an infant
sw3537A-ms98-a-0033 261.978000 274.911125 like it was three days after it was born and he was the one that delivered it and they got four attorneys one guy out of Houston he introduced [himsnelf/himself] as snake so-and-so he says well anyone have trouble awarding five million dollars
sw3537A-ms98-a-0034 274.911125 283.293000 and i says yeah i got problems [laughter-with] [laughter-that] [laughter-i] [laughter-mean] you know five million bucks isn't going to bring this kid back you know i mean as sorrowful as it is
sw3537A-ms98-a-0035 283.293000 293.701250 uh you know if the doctor is wrong you know it he should be pulled from his license but five million dollars and away he goes because insurance pays for it
sw3537A-ms98-a-0036 293.701250 298.214500 you know i[t]- i[t]- it it doesn't make logical sense to me but uh
sw3537A-ms98-a-0037 298.214500 299.458000 uh that's
