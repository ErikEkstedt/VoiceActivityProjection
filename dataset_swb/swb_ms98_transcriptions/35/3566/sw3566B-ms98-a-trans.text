sw3566B-ms98-a-0003 9.775625 18.693500 i'd had that situation presented to me personally about_1 three years ago when i had to put my place my dad in a nursing home and um
sw3566B-ms98-a-0004 18.693500 21.783500 [noise] he had Alzheimer's and he uh
sw3566B-ms98-a-0005 21.783500 30.251750 wandered and i had to put him in there for his own safety because_1 i could not i couldn't care for him here any longer i tried as hard as i could
sw3566B-ms98-a-0006 30.251750 32.471250 [silence]
sw3566B-ms98-a-0007 32.471250 42.511250 yes and uh i had to work and he would get up in the middle of the night and he could get out and wander down the street and i was afraid for his safety um
sw3566B-ms98-a-0008 42.511250 46.425750 [noise] and so i had to make that decision um
sw3566B-ms98-a-0009 46.425750 51.716750 [silence]
sw3566B-ms98-a-0010 51.716750 53.582750 yes i did
sw3566B-ms98-a-0011 53.582750 64.591000 i checked into the facilities uh the other thing that i did and i've recommended other people to do the same thing sometimes is to check and with 
sw3566B-ms98-a-0012 64.591000 69.233000 people that have family members in that nursing facility
sw3566B-ms98-a-0013 69.233000 77.492625 you know see if you can find out who who has a family member there or if you go and check it stop and ask somebody when you see them_1 you know do you have you know
sw3566B-ms98-a-0014 77.492625 83.692625 what relative do you have here um how is the care are you satisfied

sw3566B-ms98-a-0018 92.290375 93.944625 yes
sw3566B-ms98-a-0019 93.944625 102.002250 very much so there was a large range of costs uh and the cost didn't necessarily reflect the care
sw3566B-ms98-a-0020 102.002250 112.335625 the cost some of the costs went for other amenities for those that were uh up and ambulatory like really nice dining rooms and you know
sw3566B-ms98-a-0021 112.335625 122.606250 uh things like that but that was for one segment but then the other segment that needed full nursing care i didn't feel i got the benefit of the extra cost
