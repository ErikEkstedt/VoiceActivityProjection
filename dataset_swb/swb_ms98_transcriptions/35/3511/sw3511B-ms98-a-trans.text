sw3511B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 21.996625 [noise]
sw3511B-ms98-a-0002 21.996625 29.459250 i certainly agree with that we have Dallas has now become one of the most
sw3511B-ms98-a-0003 29.459250 36.130250 cr[ime]- oh our crime rate has just exceeded all
sw3511B-ms98-a-0004 36.130250 49.612125 possible goals or whatever and we keep coddling all of our our men or women incarcerated we have to have certain amount of space for them [noise]
sw3511B-ms98-a-0005 49.612125 63.508250 i'm w[ith]- i think we just must keep this capital punishment and i don't believe keeping them_1 on death row for four or five years is answering any of our problems
sw3511B-ms98-a-0006 63.508250 70.281625 [silence]
sw3511B-ms98-a-0007 70.281625 71.856375 that's right
sw3511B-ms98-a-0008 71.856375 77.913000 [silence]
sw3511B-ms98-a-0009 77.913000 81.426875 well it's not fair to the taxpayers
sw3511B-ms98-a-0010 81.426875 83.552000 so um
sw3511B-ms98-a-0011 83.552000 88.834500 [silence]
sw3511B-ms98-a-0012 88.834500 90.795750 um
sw3511B-ms98-a-0013 90.795750 100.291000 the lethal dose of uh you know slip in it i think they maybe should get back to courtyard hangings
sw3511B-ms98-a-0014 100.291000 107.858375 no no i don't really mean that but if people could see what was really happening
sw3511B-ms98-a-0015 107.858375 116.486000 i think it would deter this more than than going in with the needle and injecting them
sw3511B-ms98-a-0016 116.486000 160.993250 [silence]
sw3511B-ms98-a-0017 160.993250 163.011125 um-hum
sw3511B-ms98-a-0018 163.011125 176.015250 [silence]
sw3511B-ms98-a-0019 176.015250 177.625125 that's right
sw3511B-ms98-a-0020 177.625125 181.748000 since our have you ever served on a jury
sw3511B-ms98-a-0021 181.748000 185.577625 that is one of the most um
sw3511B-ms98-a-0022 185.577625 189.725750 [noise] well i think everyone should at least once
sw3511B-ms98-a-0023 189.725750 204.218000 it was uh i've never been on capital punishment but um i wonder if these people were guilty until proven innocent if we would not gain or more from our attorneys
sw3511B-ms98-a-0024 204.218000 206.287000 i don't know
sw3511B-ms98-a-0025 206.287000 211.986625 [silence]
sw3511B-ms98-a-0026 211.986625 213.379375 yeah

sw3511B-ms98-a-0028 215.974625 219.603875 well it certainly is a responsibility
sw3511B-ms98-a-0029 219.603875 232.213000 but i think that uh we need to demand more from our attorneys when they withhold information we have three cases going here in Dallas now
sw3511B-ms98-a-0030 232.213000 241.053875 two of them_1 were murder the well finally the husband admitted to having smothered his wife even though he loved her dearly
sw3511B-ms98-a-0031 241.053875 247.286875 so he goes up for forty years with with a possibility of being out in ten
sw3511B-ms98-a-0032 247.286875 254.421250 and the other man is charged with um poisoning his wife with arsenic
sw3511B-ms98-a-0033 254.421250 261.945750 and it was a a apparently it went on over a year they're a very wealthy family
sw3511B-ms98-a-0034 261.945750 263.964500 and uh
sw3511B-ms98-a-0035 263.964500 265.811250 oh it just

sw3511B-ms98-a-0039 289.440375 291.346875 yeah
