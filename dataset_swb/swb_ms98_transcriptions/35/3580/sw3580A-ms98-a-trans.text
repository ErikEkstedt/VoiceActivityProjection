sw3580A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 4.978000 [noise] uh well uh to begin i guess uh space
sw3580A-ms98-a-0002 4.978000 9.752125 is uh real important i think so it's real vital to the future of
sw3580A-ms98-a-0003 9.752125 15.446875 not only our kids but every generation until the end of time i guess so
sw3580A-ms98-a-0004 15.446875 16.812750 [silence]

sw3580A-ms98-a-0009 24.357375 27.137500 i'm not too up to date on the space
sw3580A-ms98-a-0010 27.137500 30.245375 on the space frontier but uh
sw3580A-ms98-a-0011 30.245375 38.980875 but i guess they're going going pretty far into it now um Star Wars is not too [laughter-far] i don't think but uh

sw3580A-ms98-a-0022 81.230250 86.359125 well i don't know you think you'd you think you'd uh go up in space you had a chance
sw3580A-ms98-a-0023 86.359125 87.990750 would you
sw3580A-ms98-a-0024 87.990750 94.693125 i think i would ju[st]- just sitting here ta[lking]- talking about it if the time came it'd be real nervous [laughter]
sw3580A-ms98-a-0025 94.693125 97.911500 i'd be scared i think that'd be worse than
sw3580A-ms98-a-0026 97.911500 101.180625 Six Flags [laughter] roller coaster that'd be
sw3580A-ms98-a-0027 101.180625 102.601750 pretty hairy
sw3580A-ms98-a-0028 102.601750 107.119625 [silence]

sw3580A-ms98-a-0034 123.525125 124.618375 [silence]
sw3580A-ms98-a-0035 124.618375 131.038375 and opening up those stations or what ever filling them_1 i don't know if we'll ever see that but
sw3580A-ms98-a-0036 131.038375 134.184375 [silence]
sw3580A-ms98-a-0037 134.184375 135.867875 oh really
sw3580A-ms98-a-0038 135.867875 141.693375 that's all [laughter] beyond my imagination really but science fiction books
sw3580A-ms98-a-0039 141.693375 149.757500 i mean you look at the Jetsons you know a cartoon show and it's not too far fetched what what they all had in those cartoons so you never know
sw3580A-ms98-a-0040 149.757500 155.524000 and they had stuff on the Jetsons from that cartoon that you would never imagine would come
sw3580A-ms98-a-0041 155.524000 159.673250 become possible and now you we have lot of those so
sw3580A-ms98-a-0042 159.673250 163.191125 so you never know what what may occur but
sw3580A-ms98-a-0043 163.191125 164.207125 [silence]
sw3580A-ms98-a-0044 164.207125 167.798750 as far as me seeing it no
sw3580A-ms98-a-0045 167.798750 170.947875 i don't [laughter-know] i don't know but
sw3580A-ms98-a-0046 170.947875 177.563375 i think it's real vital important for the future you know generations to come so
sw3580A-ms98-a-0047 177.563375 187.887875 [silence]
sw3580A-ms98-a-0048 187.887875 189.291500 yeah
sw3580A-ms98-a-0049 189.291500 195.514125 i'm sure it'll draw a lot more interest too once it becomes you know like it's more possible that 
sw3580A-ms98-a-0050 195.514125 200.485875 when they start showing the drawings and all that i'm sure you know when they
sw3580A-ms98-a-0051 200.485875 203.388875 [silence]
sw3580A-ms98-a-0052 203.388875 204.631500 right

sw3580A-ms98-a-0056 215.731000 222.862875 so did they scratch those uh that Star Wars deal you know the one we was all worried about Russia and all that
sw3580A-ms98-a-0057 222.862875 227.836750 [silence]
sw3580A-ms98-a-0058 227.836750 232.412750 yeah but the economy the way it is all over them_1 they probably cut back on
sw3580A-ms98-a-0059 232.412750 234.727875 on that because_1 it's not
sw3580A-ms98-a-0060 234.727875 238.468875 [silence]
sw3580A-ms98-a-0061 238.468875 239.797500 right

sw3580A-ms98-a-0064 244.756125 249.941750 yeah and we don't know who's ha[ndling]- handling them now so that's a whole different story now
sw3580A-ms98-a-0065 249.941750 253.318875 [silence]
sw3580A-ms98-a-0066 253.318875 255.039500 oh really

sw3580A-ms98-a-0075 284.310375 288.684000 i think we went through him though to get to Gorbachev on a lot of subjects so
sw3580A-ms98-a-0076 288.684000 291.707500 but that way [laughter] you can't never tell that
