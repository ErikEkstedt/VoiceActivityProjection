sw3506B-ms98-a-0011 63.035750 67.132250 [silence]
sw3506B-ms98-a-0012 67.132250 70.230000 probably not nachos and dip huh
sw3506B-ms98-a-0013 70.230000 72.393000 [laughter]
sw3506B-ms98-a-0014 72.393000 80.481625 and would you uh would it be appropriate to um drink with the uh prior when you have the hors d'oeuvres
sw3506B-ms98-a-0015 80.481625 81.536500 [silence]

sw3506B-ms98-a-0021 97.014125 99.367250 that would be my guess
sw3506B-ms98-a-0022 99.367250 100.992500 and
sw3506B-ms98-a-0023 100.992500 103.922500 [silence]

sw3506B-ms98-a-0027 117.238000 119.016375 well let's see
sw3506B-ms98-a-0028 119.016375 122.712375 usually when we have a dinner party i always i like to grill
sw3506B-ms98-a-0029 122.712375 132.847250 so we might have some cocktails ahead of time and maybe some uh some dip uh some cheese one of our favorite
sw3506B-ms98-a-0030 132.847250 139.528250 is uh to take some let's see Philadelphia cream cheese i think is that what comes in those little blocks
sw3506B-ms98-a-0031 139.528250 146.209250 and pour cocktail sauce over the top of it and then get these little canned shrimp
sw3506B-ms98-a-0032 146.209250 152.134000 and uh wash them_1 and cool them_1 and then dump them_1 in the uh sauce
sw3506B-ms98-a-0033 152.134000 161.629750 and then take crackers and then you just dip the cracker in the sauce and the clams and the cream cheese and you have a real nice dip that goes good with a cocktail
sw3506B-ms98-a-0034 161.629750 163.913625 and then i like to barbecue
sw3506B-ms98-a-0035 163.913625 174.402250 like steaks or pork chops and then we have uh so[mething]- oh lot of times we'll have baked potatoes with them_1 and uh salad and then uh

sw3506B-ms98-a-0040 187.617500 192.132375 but that's i guess when you talk about dinner party that's probably not uh
sw3506B-ms98-a-0041 192.132375 196.947000 that's more for like when friends come over and traditional yeah i wouldn't be the big uh
