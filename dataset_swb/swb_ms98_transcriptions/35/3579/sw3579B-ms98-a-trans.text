sw3579B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.499125 [noise]
sw3579B-ms98-a-0002 0.499125 2.198375 [silence]
sw3579B-ms98-a-0003 2.198375 4.413250 well um
sw3579B-ms98-a-0004 4.413250 6.432875 [noise] in [vocalized-noise]
sw3579B-ms98-a-0005 6.432875 10.941750 an[d]- i think what it is in this country is that we have this uh
sw3579B-ms98-a-0006 10.941750 15.129625 despite all the complaints we have about government we essentially
sw3579B-ms98-a-0007 15.129625 22.811750 have a great deal of faith that despite uh any election things really aren't going to
sw3579B-ms98-a-0008 22.811750 25.810125 change [vocalized-noise] dramatically
sw3579B-ms98-a-0009 25.810125 30.729750 based on any given election and there really no one gets all
sw3579B-ms98-a-0010 30.729750 38.476625 excited over politics um over the the i mean you think of some countries where they've changed uh
sw3579B-ms98-a-0011 38.476625 50.598500 um you know it'll have a a coup or some ridiculous form of government there may change uh every few years like for an example would be the gov[ernments]- South American governments
sw3579B-ms98-a-0012 50.598500 55.376750 but here it's it's very stable and i [vocalized-noise] there's
sw3579B-ms98-a-0013 55.376750 61.866250 nothing really to get all that excited over but maybe people should get a little excited and
sw3579B-ms98-a-0014 61.866250 63.686875 and make some changes
sw3579B-ms98-a-0015 63.686875 68.960250 [silence]
sw3579B-ms98-a-0016 68.960250 73.136250 right right yeah people will vote presidential elections
sw3579B-ms98-a-0017 73.136250 79.075125 um you know a local election that may have some great import but uh
sw3579B-ms98-a-0018 79.075125 85.126875 you know over all people don't have a whole lot t[o]- t[o]- worry [laughter-about] when it comes to politics
sw3579B-ms98-a-0019 85.126875 87.908250 [silence]
sw3579B-ms98-a-0020 87.908250 89.900125 yeah they're tha[t]-
sw3579B-ms98-a-0021 89.900125 98.651125 [silence]
sw3579B-ms98-a-0022 98.651125 103.806125 yeah well that that's just it i'm i'm twenty four and i'm in the military
sw3579B-ms98-a-0023 103.806125 113.613500 and uh i'm a um registered to vote in Pennsylvania and i only voted once it was in uh well the last presidential election
sw3579B-ms98-a-0024 113.613500 119.456625 you know and that was just because_1 [laughter-you] [laughter-know] [laughter-it's] [laughter] it's too much of a hassle to get the absentee ballot
sw3579B-ms98-a-0025 119.456625 128.025125 or even to to drive back there which is what i did that time i actually went and visited my folks and voted the same time but uh
sw3579B-ms98-a-0026 128.025125 139.095000 um in my position i [vocalized-noise] well in addition to that and the local political scene i don't know enough about it anymore to even feel that my vote means [laughter-anything]
sw3579B-ms98-a-0027 139.095000 142.985750 because i don't know the the candidates um
sw3579B-ms98-a-0028 142.985750 144.599250 [silence]
sw3579B-ms98-a-0029 144.599250 146.453875 right yeah
sw3579B-ms98-a-0030 146.453875 148.009375 [silence]
sw3579B-ms98-a-0031 148.009375 151.157750 right right but i i think um
sw3579B-ms98-a-0032 151.157750 152.189125 [silence]
sw3579B-ms98-a-0033 152.189125 154.343625 that's all things that
sw3579B-ms98-a-0034 154.343625 155.700750 that
sw3579B-ms98-a-0035 155.700750 158.686375 it's all my own laziness though
sw3579B-ms98-a-0036 158.686375 169.166750 because [vocalized-noise] first of all i should take the time to find out about the candidates i probably should talk to my mom and dad and who do live there and get the feeling for what uh
sw3579B-ms98-a-0037 169.166750 177.831375 for what they are you know have been doing and uh or for what what they feel the candidates are doing and uh
sw3579B-ms98-a-0038 177.831375 184.138750 um maybe do a little looking into it myself it's not like any of this is any big secret
sw3579B-ms98-a-0039 184.138750 189.146375 but it's just a question of taking the time and it's they're
sw3579B-ms98-a-0040 189.146375 193.060875 higher priorities right [laughter]
sw3579B-ms98-a-0041 193.060875 196.992125 [silence]
sw3579B-ms98-a-0042 196.992125 199.750000 right David Duke yeah
sw3579B-ms98-a-0043 199.750000 200.849000 [silence]
sw3579B-ms98-a-0044 200.849000 203.359125 yeah that was interesting there was quite a few people
sw3579B-ms98-a-0045 203.359125 207.490250 in this area that had contributed to his campaign
sw3579B-ms98-a-0046 207.490250 219.079875 and i'm in upstate New York and this is kind of a redneck area what the local newspapers um printed they somehow got a list of all of Duke's contributors
sw3579B-ms98-a-0047 219.079875 224.642375 and they printed a list in the newspaper of everybody that gave money to that campaign
sw3579B-ms98-a-0048 224.642375 234.635250 you wanna talk about gettin[g]- gettin[g]- even with them you know that was i thought that was beautiful [laughter] that's justice
sw3579B-ms98-a-0049 234.635250 236.239875 what's that
sw3579B-ms98-a-0050 236.239875 237.286750 [silence]
sw3579B-ms98-a-0051 237.286750 239.734875 yeah yeah oh yeah
sw3579B-ms98-a-0052 239.734875 246.639625 yeah you know people you think about having s[omebody]- uh somebody like that in power and the
sw3579B-ms98-a-0053 246.639625 249.963250 you know and that shocks them all but then
sw3579B-ms98-a-0054 249.963250 256.189750 um flip side of that is the same people go around um harboring their own
sw3579B-ms98-a-0055 256.189750 263.529875 racist racist practices and ra[ce]- race you know you ask those same people um how they treat
sw3579B-ms98-a-0056 263.529875 269.087500 people and all that and you probably would not get a very favorable answer out of them_1
sw3579B-ms98-a-0057 269.087500 278.765625 but the idea the merit the thought of somebody who publicly was a member of the Ku Klux Klan is pretty repulsive being in a position of power like that
sw3579B-ms98-a-0058 278.765625 280.179625 so
sw3579B-ms98-a-0059 280.179625 282.989000 [silence]
sw3579B-ms98-a-0060 282.989000 287.907500 what we can do to make it better [laughter-right] that that's hard because
sw3579B-ms98-a-0061 287.907500 299.074000 um i thought in the last or not not this last year's election but the one a year ago that they were gonn[a]- that there was gonna be some serious turn around of the incumbents and all that the people are finally fed up
