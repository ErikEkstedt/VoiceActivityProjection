sw3572B-ms98-a-0005 9.360625 20.477375 um i agree i think that our education system needs revamped i and i think a lot of the ways they're going about it are not going to work i don't think just shoveling more money
sw3572B-ms98-a-0006 20.477375 24.445750 into the education system is the answer um
sw3572B-ms98-a-0007 24.445750 36.251250 i know that here they keep saying oh we need more money and more money and more money but i don't think i don't think that's the answer i think we need to take a different approach to how we go about it um
sw3572B-ms98-a-0008 36.251250 39.716375 are you familiar at all with the voucher system
sw3572B-ms98-a-0009 39.716375 41.547500 [silence]
sw3572B-ms98-a-0010 41.547500 49.269250 um i'm in favor of that i think that you know every parent i think if we were given so much money in a voucher
sw3572B-ms98-a-0011 49.269250 59.293000 and we're able to choose which schools to take our children to i think that would put competition between the schools and give the teachers some incentives to make
sw3572B-ms98-a-0012 59.293000 67.861250 you know to do a better job and the principals to have their schools being better and and i think it would put a lot of pressure that's needed on the education
sw3572B-ms98-a-0013 67.861250 80.342750 uh folks so that they would you know do better rather than just getting into their jobs and getting their tenure and not having to put forth a lot i don't know what do you think about that
sw3572B-ms98-a-0014 80.342750 89.028125 [silence]
sw3572B-ms98-a-0015 89.028125 90.240750 uh-hum

sw3572B-ms98-a-0020 105.274500 111.111625 the home school is an option the only the only private school i think there's probably one
sw3572B-ms98-a-0021 111.111625 122.276875 well there may be two private schools for the elementary age kids and they are you know down in Salt Lake so for me that's not really an option are there very many private schools there in Dallas

sw3572B-ms98-a-0024 141.140500 151.360000 so see then that does put a little bit more um pressure on your public schools to perform what happens to those schools where nobody wants to go to
