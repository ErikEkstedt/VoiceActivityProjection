sw3572A-ms98-a-0002 0.678375 8.201875 well seems to me that part of the problem with public education may just be the wide disparity in what's being offered i don't know what you've experienced
sw3572A-ms98-a-0003 8.201875 39.687750 [silence]
sw3572A-ms98-a-0004 39.687750 41.319125 i've heard of it
sw3572A-ms98-a-0005 41.319125 80.155750 [silence]
sw3572A-ms98-a-0006 80.155750 90.964250 well part of the deal is uh [noise] in addition to the public schools there're all these other alternatives such as the private schools and the religious schools and the home schooling and
sw3572A-ms98-a-0007 90.964250 100.902750 and some of these other options that uh that people are looking at but uh to ensure that everyone has a chance the public education system has got to do the job 
sw3572A-ms98-a-0008 100.902750 121.740750 [silence]
sw3572A-ms98-a-0009 121.740750 127.552375 well there're a number of them what happens is we have a number of school districts and those school districts
sw3572A-ms98-a-0010 127.552375 138.865000 that are considered quality people stay in those school districts that are not quality people who can afford them opt out and and are going to the private schools or the schools that are sponsored by by the one of the religions 
sw3572A-ms98-a-0011 138.865000 150.877000 [silence]
sw3572A-ms98-a-0012 150.877000 155.317000 well there's always people end up going to schools who can't afford to go anywhere else
sw3572A-ms98-a-0013 155.317000 157.380500 who will end up still going to
sw3572A-ms98-a-0014 157.380500 159.572000 that particular school
sw3572A-ms98-a-0015 159.572000 163.322500 and and can't opt out because they don't have the money to
sw3572A-ms98-a-0016 163.322500 167.250250 go to private schools private schools here are very expensive
sw3572A-ms98-a-0017 167.250250 171.048375 [silence]
sw3572A-ms98-a-0018 171.048375 178.465500 i i don't know much about the religious schools about the only really religious schools around here are the ones operated by the Catholic Church but it seems
sw3572A-ms98-a-0019 178.465500 184.204875 that the private schools uh get the greater share of people than the religious schools do
sw3572A-ms98-a-0020 184.204875 193.906125 [silence]
sw3572A-ms98-a-0021 193.906125 195.127375 well

sw3572A-ms98-a-0023 196.135375 199.959375 well you know salaries for teachers i think are low everywhere um
sw3572A-ms98-a-0024 199.959375 203.408625 most teachers never end up making much money
sw3572A-ms98-a-0025 203.408625 212.274625 if you're if you're good in an area and are not dedicated you can make far more money being in that area rather than teaching in that area
sw3572A-ms98-a-0026 212.274625 214.610625 [silence]

sw3572A-ms98-a-0032 231.100000 232.966875 it hasn't really gotten going yet
sw3572A-ms98-a-0033 232.966875 244.128375 [silence]
sw3572A-ms98-a-0034 244.128375 247.837750 um as far as i know they're doing something else but i don't know
sw3572A-ms98-a-0035 247.837750 249.329125 specifically
sw3572A-ms98-a-0036 249.329125 251.330750 you know what they are doing
sw3572A-ms98-a-0037 251.330750 260.040000 of course if if it interrupted it here then it would mess up lots of sports and camps and other things that rely on that
sw3572A-ms98-a-0038 260.040000 262.073625 you know long vacation period
sw3572A-ms98-a-0039 262.073625 284.396250 [silence]
