sw3565B-ms98-a-0002 0.496500 3.835500 our most recent uh
sw3565B-ms98-a-0003 3.835500 9.713750 in series of projects i guess was inside was uh we remodeled the bathroom recently
sw3565B-ms98-a-0004 9.713750 11.572375 [silence]
sw3565B-ms98-a-0005 11.572375 19.929500 well it went pretty well um other than the fact that we encountered some uh problems that you run across in older homes with uh plumbing
sw3565B-ms98-a-0006 19.929500 22.367500 which one thing led to another
sw3565B-ms98-a-0007 22.367500 25.858375 and eventually we ended up replacing all the pipes
sw3565B-ms98-a-0008 25.858375 33.269500 from the sink clear back to the main drain which meant you need take the wall out and start all over
sw3565B-ms98-a-0009 33.269500 35.152625 it wasn't one of those
sw3565B-ms98-a-0010 35.152625 42.684750 it started out as a Sunday project and by the by the next Sunday it was done it wasn't a {one-dayer}
sw3565B-ms98-a-0011 42.684750 44.562625 believe me
sw3565B-ms98-a-0012 44.562625 49.536000 [silence]

sw3565B-ms98-a-0017 57.415250 61.318625 well that's the thing that surprised me because once i got into the plumbing
sw3565B-ms98-a-0018 61.318625 64.840125 everything in there was copper and it was all soldered
sw3565B-ms98-a-0019 64.840125 71.526875 that's what drove me bananas because you know i'm going to the hardware store saying give me plastic pipe and and
sw3565B-ms98-a-0020 71.526875 73.005125 and cement
sw3565B-ms98-a-0021 73.005125 79.514000 to fit them_1 together and nothing wanted to go so it was like i had to go all the way back to the main drain and start all over
sw3565B-ms98-a-0022 79.514000 80.573625 [silence]
sw3565B-ms98-a-0023 80.573625 81.981625 really
sw3565B-ms98-a-0024 81.981625 85.088750 that was an all day job just to get it plumbed
sw3565B-ms98-a-0025 85.088750 87.042875 [silence]
sw3565B-ms98-a-0026 87.042875 96.993000 fortunately i was very fortunate uh in the fact that uh when i made the installation of the sink and everything bolted up and we turned the water on nothing leaked
sw3565B-ms98-a-0027 96.993000 101.778375 everything worked and i just said that's marvelous i appreciate it
sw3565B-ms98-a-0028 101.778375 103.861125 [silence]
sw3565B-ms98-a-0029 103.861125 112.004625 well i expected something to leak you know left a fitting loose or didn't use Teflon tape on one or something like that
sw3565B-ms98-a-0030 112.004625 115.455500 but it all came together so i i felt pretty fortunate about that
sw3565B-ms98-a-0031 115.455500 116.687000 [silence]
