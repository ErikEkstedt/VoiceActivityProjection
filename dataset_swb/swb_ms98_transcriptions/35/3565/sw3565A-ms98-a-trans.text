sw3565A-ms98-a-0041 118.151500 125.965875 well um ah probably the last thing i did was uh paint and wallpaper kids room
sw3565A-ms98-a-0042 125.965875 134.340000 and uh i learned uh i used the wrong kind of paint this wasn't must have not been a very good quality because_1 it just hasn't
sw3565A-ms98-a-0043 134.340000 136.407000 stood up very well
sw3565A-ms98-a-0044 136.407000 142.822750 it was a latex [plaint/paint] paint it was flat and i wonder if maybe i should've used the gloss
sw3565A-ms98-a-0045 142.822750 146.334250 uh but they say you uh use your gloss mainly in your
sw3565A-ms98-a-0046 146.334250 150.424125 kitchens and things like that
sw3565A-ms98-a-0047 150.424125 152.335875 [silence]
sw3565A-ms98-a-0048 152.335875 156.658000 yeah but i think maybe uh i don't know if it was just the

sw3565A-ms98-a-0050 158.028375 166.278125 well it it is a latex paint but it just kind of is so you know so it's supposed to wash you're supposed to be able to wash it
sw3565A-ms98-a-0051 166.278125 174.554375 [noise] but it um just looks dingy i don't know how else to explain it just it's pink
sw3565A-ms98-a-0052 174.554375 176.993625 it's kind of got uh
sw3565A-ms98-a-0053 176.993625 186.796500 oh just kind of a worn look to it i don't eve[n]- even know how to say [noise] just didn't turn out quite as nice as i would have liked but
sw3565A-ms98-a-0054 186.796500 189.485750 [silence]
sw3565A-ms98-a-0055 189.485750 197.837000 [vocalized-noise] we put two coats on it and it's a small room but i think it only took one uh can
sw3565A-ms98-a-0056 197.837000 199.984750 [noise] no
sw3565A-ms98-a-0057 199.984750 201.997500 [noise] we did uh
sw3565A-ms98-a-0058 201.997500 205.431375 oh you do mix the color as far as
sw3565A-ms98-a-0059 205.431375 210.655250 you start with uh white and then they add the color you know what i'm saying but
sw3565A-ms98-a-0060 210.655250 212.124750 [noise]
sw3565A-ms98-a-0061 212.124750 218.275875 yes right and then i wallpapered a couple of walls and uh
sw3565A-ms98-a-0062 218.275875 219.328000 [silence]
sw3565A-ms98-a-0063 219.328000 227.004250 well that was the first time i've ever wallpapered and uh [laughter] [laughter-that's] a an education in itself
sw3565A-ms98-a-0064 227.004250 238.604500 but uh the dye lots uh must have been a little bit different from first of all it takes quite a few rolls even a small room if you're trying to match a design and i
sw3565A-ms98-a-0065 238.604500 247.766750 yes that's what i needed and i didn't think about that i got a Mickey Mouse print is [laughter-what] [laughter-i] [laughter-got] and so a lot is wasted
sw3565A-ms98-a-0066 247.766750 250.227375 [silence]
sw3565A-ms98-a-0067 250.227375 256.544375 so you'd know how i see i didn't even think to look for that [noise] and then the
sw3565A-ms98-a-0068 256.544375 263.940750 one of them_1 was just a [noise] different color different color pink is what it ended up being
sw3565A-ms98-a-0069 263.940750 265.591250 and i
sw3565A-ms98-a-0070 265.591250 267.544125 [silence]
sw3565A-ms98-a-0071 267.544125 270.039875 no i didn't is that how you're supposed to do
sw3565A-ms98-a-0072 270.039875 274.119125 i started at one edge and went over
sw3565A-ms98-a-0073 274.119125 276.762875 then you had to cut around the closet
sw3565A-ms98-a-0074 276.762875 279.386750 and cut around a window
sw3565A-ms98-a-0075 279.386750 281.488250 but uh
sw3565A-ms98-a-0076 281.488250 287.872625 [silence]
sw3565A-ms98-a-0077 287.872625 289.773375 and start right there
