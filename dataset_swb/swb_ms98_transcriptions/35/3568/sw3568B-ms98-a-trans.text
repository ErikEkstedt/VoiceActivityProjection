sw3568B-ms98-a-0029 110.823000 115.200000 well i like them_1 for a couple of aspects one is you don't have to carry a lot of cash with you
sw3568B-ms98-a-0030 115.200000 124.489125 and the other is you know you got that statement and you can make one payment you don't have to write out a bunch of checks or always be paying for things it's convenient from that standpoint
sw3568B-ms98-a-0031 124.489125 125.543500 [silence]
sw3568B-ms98-a-0032 125.543500 136.905000 so it's it's nice from that s[tandpoint]- from that angle but it can get out of hand in the interest rate on them_1 is is quite high generally there are some that are lower you know you can get some that are
sw3568B-ms98-a-0033 136.905000 143.890375 oh probably around twelve thirteen percent but most are around sixteen to eighteen or higher
sw3568B-ms98-a-0034 143.890375 153.493750 [silence]
sw3568B-ms98-a-0035 153.493750 154.927625 okay
sw3568B-ms98-a-0036 154.927625 156.532000 [silence]
sw3568B-ms98-a-0037 156.532000 162.899125 yeah although you know they keep increasing your limit too you know i had a card that uh
sw3568B-ms98-a-0038 162.899125 167.096125 well i think it started out with like a fifteen hundred dollar limit
sw3568B-ms98-a-0039 167.096125 171.876000 and i've had it for several years and i think i'm now up to uh seven thousand five hundred on it
sw3568B-ms98-a-0040 171.876000 176.564375 i mean i'm not course i don't always spend that much but that's what they'd let me spend if i wanted to
sw3568B-ms98-a-0041 176.564375 180.307625 i guess they they get to trusting you a little bit and
sw3568B-ms98-a-0042 180.307625 188.939375 i want to hold that bait out i don't know if the card companies that you ha[ve]- usually around Christmas time they'll they'll send you a little group of checks
sw3568B-ms98-a-0043 188.939375 199.846250 say instead of using your credit card if you want to just go ahead and write these checks and we'll charge it'll go right against your account they they try to induce you during the Christmas season to to wrack up a few more [laughter-dollars]
sw3568B-ms98-a-0044 199.846250 204.174625 so i think they're good but you've got to be careful
sw3568B-ms98-a-0045 204.174625 205.269000 [silence]
sw3568B-ms98-a-0046 205.269000 207.776625 that'd be my overall summary
