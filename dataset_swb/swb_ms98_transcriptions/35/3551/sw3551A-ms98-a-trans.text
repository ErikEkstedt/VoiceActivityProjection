sw3551A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.039750 [noise]
sw3551A-ms98-a-0002 0.039750 2.347250 no maybe not how big is Provo that
sw3551A-ms98-a-0003 2.347250 3.456125 [silence]
sw3551A-ms98-a-0004 3.456125 6.623750 that a little town or i[s]- one of the bigger cities
sw3551A-ms98-a-0005 6.623750 16.141000 [silence]
sw3551A-ms98-a-0006 16.141000 21.136375 oh i- i talked to someone that was o[nly]- only a couple of thousand in her town i think
sw3551A-ms98-a-0007 21.136375 25.069875 yeah i forgot the name of the town [laughter-i] thought maybe it was you [laughter]
sw3551A-ms98-a-0008 25.069875 32.082375 oh well anyway we're supposed to talk about education i certainly had some ideas since i'm studying it now in college
sw3551A-ms98-a-0009 32.082375 39.291375 i'd say first of all they need to go back to spending more time on the basic reading writing arithmetic
sw3551A-ms98-a-0010 39.291375 45.733375 and grade school because they really teach about forty percent less than they used to and it shows up
sw3551A-ms98-a-0011 45.733375 48.661625 that's one idea you have any [laughter-hm] [noise]
sw3551A-ms98-a-0012 48.661625 55.582125 [silence]
sw3551A-ms98-a-0013 55.582125 57.259000 um-hum
sw3551A-ms98-a-0014 57.259000 61.638250 [silence]
sw3551A-ms98-a-0015 61.638250 69.008375 [noise] yeah it Plano's uh improved greatly in the last twenty twenty five years that's for sure it used to be the pits
sw3551A-ms98-a-0016 69.008375 76.211000 and uh Arlington is excellent now but i'm just speaking overall across the country something is [laughter-definitely] [laughter-wrong]
sw3551A-ms98-a-0017 76.211000 80.044125 and uh one thing they don't spend as much time
sw3551A-ms98-a-0018 80.044125 86.077625 just teaching reading and writing so a lot of kids are just being promoted from year to year and they truly can't read
sw3551A-ms98-a-0019 86.077625 88.565875 so i don't know how they expect them_1 to uh pass
sw3551A-ms98-a-0020 88.565875 93.611375 history when they can't read anything you know or even read a word problem in math
sw3551A-ms98-a-0021 93.611375 103.341625 so um that's definitely a problem another problem is you're not gonna keep the smarter people in the system too long paying the wages [laughter-they] [laughter-do]
sw3551A-ms98-a-0022 103.341625 105.226250 but um
sw3551A-ms98-a-0023 105.226250 110.377375 [silence]
sw3551A-ms98-a-0024 110.377375 117.660375 [noise] what is good about well it depends on where you're they're all so different that's another thing about the United States there's no national curriculum you know
sw3551A-ms98-a-0025 117.660375 125.963125 i mean what they'd be teaching in an Arlington school they might not be teaching in a Plano school and and the very same
sw3551A-ms98-a-0026 125.963125 131.281875 school district you may even in an Arlington seventh grade for instance you may have
sw3551A-ms98-a-0027 131.281875 139.391500 an English class you may have half literature for the whole year whereas in another one they're gonna concentrate on grammar and give you a little literature it's up to the teacher in other words
sw3551A-ms98-a-0028 139.391500 143.039875 so that's kind of o[dd]- you know that's kind of odd to me
sw3551A-ms98-a-0029 143.039875 145.206375 it depends on um
sw3551A-ms98-a-0030 145.206375 149.020750 what school you're in and who your teacher is actually
sw3551A-ms98-a-0031 149.020750 157.722250 uh or is it how you end [laughter-up] overall Arlington is good one of the better ones in the state so i guess we lucked out when we moved here
sw3551A-ms98-a-0032 157.722250 162.507750 [silence]
sw3551A-ms98-a-0033 162.507750 171.446250 um-hum [noise] of course we have a slight problem in that uh the number of the illiterate in America is mushrooming
sw3551A-ms98-a-0034 171.446250 181.573500 at this point and uh you know where our kids might be in a great school we're still paying an awful lot of taxes for people who are on welfare and unemployment because they can't read you know
sw3551A-ms98-a-0035 181.573500 183.647250 so if y[ou]-
sw3551A-ms98-a-0036 183.647250 186.618750 [silence]
sw3551A-ms98-a-0037 186.618750 193.646000 i don't know i just read about that the other day and i had never even thought of it actually it makes sense to a certain extent because sometimes
sw3551A-ms98-a-0038 193.646000 203.696750 uh like a third grade teacher will get kids from second grade that didn't even learn what uh they should to do the work that she's supposed to teach you know
sw3551A-ms98-a-0039 203.696750 213.805750 oh the and uh according to her plan so i guess if there was a national curriculum we'd at least [noise] have a certain amount that all kids would learn
sw3551A-ms98-a-0040 213.805750 221.717125 but uh we actually rank forty ninth in the world as far as just plain literacy goes you know
sw3551A-ms98-a-0041 221.717125 230.001000 that's that's pretty low that there's forty eight countries ahead of us that have more peo[ple]- more citizens {percentagewise} that can read and write
sw3551A-ms98-a-0042 230.001000 231.650375 so um
sw3551A-ms98-a-0043 231.650375 233.618750 unless we wanna keep paying
sw3551A-ms98-a-0044 233.618750 238.007750 paying for these people that can't make it in society we're gonna have to do something
sw3551A-ms98-a-0045 238.007750 240.129875 [silence]
sw3551A-ms98-a-0046 240.129875 245.754875 [noise] i don't know obviously nobody's smart enough to say i've figured it out yet so i probably [laughter-can't]
sw3551A-ms98-a-0047 245.754875 257.265500 [noise] but i do think that we have to cut out some of this folderol stuff and go back in the first five six grades and just keep g[oing]- going over and over and over until most of those th[at]- are capable can at least learn to read and write
sw3551A-ms98-a-0048 257.265500 259.583000 because they can't even get the {meanialest}
sw3551A-ms98-a-0049 259.583000 262.433125 job without being able to read something nowadays
sw3551A-ms98-a-0050 262.433125 263.803375 you know
sw3551A-ms98-a-0051 263.803375 265.249125 uh
sw3551A-ms98-a-0052 265.249125 275.057625 you can b[e]- you can't even work an answering machine i[f]- if you were at work and had to get a message or [laughter-some[thing]-] you know or fill out an application to work at McDonald's if you can't read
sw3551A-ms98-a-0053 275.057625 281.181500 [noise] so uh i think that that's a start at least going back to the basics in the early grades
sw3551A-ms98-a-0054 281.181500 282.109375 hm
sw3551A-ms98-a-0055 282.109375 284.006625 and um
sw3551A-ms98-a-0056 284.006625 291.099500 they say that the average English student nowadays does at least fifty percent less reading and writing than they did twenty years ago
sw3551A-ms98-a-0057 291.099500 293.283125 [noise] and that's a big jump
sw3551A-ms98-a-0058 293.283125 296.033375 yeah did you go to school in Plano
sw3551A-ms98-a-0059 296.033375 297.711750 through the through high school
sw3551A-ms98-a-0060 297.711750 298.722000 [silence]
