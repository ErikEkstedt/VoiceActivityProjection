sw3553B-ms98-a-0007 25.987500 36.231750 it it was a matter uh she reached the point where she couldn't stay by herself during the daytime she and my sister who never married lived together
sw3553B-ms98-a-0008 36.231750 48.362750 and my sister couldn't retire at the time so my uh mother's physician recommended that uh she go into a nursing home
sw3553B-ms98-a-0009 48.362750 52.505750 and fortunately my sister was able to go visit her twice a day

sw3553B-ms98-a-0019 80.869750 86.401875 and uh she realized that it was something that had to be done
sw3553B-ms98-a-0020 86.401875 93.044000 but she had begun to lose a great deal o[f]- of her memory capacity at the time
