sw3545A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.041125 [silence]
sw3545A-ms98-a-0002 0.041125 3.123375 okay um tell me about where you live
sw3545A-ms98-a-0003 3.123375 4.567000 [silence]
sw3545A-ms98-a-0004 4.567000 5.995625 uh-huh
sw3545A-ms98-a-0005 5.995625 7.183375 [silence]
sw3545A-ms98-a-0006 7.183375 8.558750 yeah
sw3545A-ms98-a-0007 8.558750 10.926125 [noise] no i live in Houston
sw3545A-ms98-a-0008 10.926125 18.517625 although i did live in Dallas for uh six years up until uh nineteen ninety and then i- i moved to Houston
sw3545A-ms98-a-0009 18.517625 28.149250 but uh i uh had lived in Houston before and uh from nineteen eighty to nineteen eighty four and uh l[ived]- worked downtown
sw3545A-ms98-a-0010 28.149250 34.813875 and when i was transferred from Atlanta uh to Houston i- i bought a condo in southwest Houston
sw3545A-ms98-a-0011 34.813875 44.282125 no and i clocked it and it was only nine miles from the office and of course didn't think that would be bad uh but the only time i ever drove it was not during rush hour
sw3545A-ms98-a-0012 44.282125 56.945125 [laughter-so] so a[fter]- it was a rude awakening to me to find out what i faced every morning and every afternoon in [laughter-Houston] [laughter-traffic] because where i lived in Atlanta wa[s]- i lived right on Peachtree um a mile and a half from the office
sw3545A-ms98-a-0013 56.945125 67.461625 and so i wasn't accustomed to commuting and it nearly killed me so whenever i moved back to Houston i said i- i declared that i would not live where i had to drive on the freeways so now i live
sw3545A-ms98-a-0014 67.461625 73.684875 in really inner city and uh but it's only it takes me about ten minutes to get to the office and i love it
sw3545A-ms98-a-0015 73.684875 76.586375 [silence]
sw3545A-ms98-a-0016 76.586375 78.866875 [noise] well i'm in an apartment
sw3545A-ms98-a-0017 78.866875 82.877250 but uh [noise] it's just i don't know it's uh
sw3545A-ms98-a-0018 82.877250 84.037125 i mean
sw3545A-ms98-a-0019 84.037125 85.050750 [silence]
sw3545A-ms98-a-0020 85.050750 90.041750 most most of the people that i work with you know commute in anywhere from
sw3545A-ms98-a-0021 90.041750 94.624250 thirty to forty five minutes some of them_1 an hour or more one way
sw3545A-ms98-a-0022 94.624250 103.562375 and you know [noise] i mean i've i've had a house before and i mean and it's nice but it's just not worth it to me to sit behind the wheel of a car for that long
sw3545A-ms98-a-0023 103.562375 106.129875 i just i can't do it so
sw3545A-ms98-a-0024 106.129875 110.158625 anyway i'm ve[ry]- i'm i'm pretty content for the time being where i am
sw3545A-ms98-a-0025 110.158625 116.200125 [silence]
sw3545A-ms98-a-0026 116.200125 117.627750 uh-huh
sw3545A-ms98-a-0027 117.627750 131.180250 [silence]
sw3545A-ms98-a-0028 131.180250 133.795000 uh-huh that i[sn't]- that isn't bad really
sw3545A-ms98-a-0029 133.795000 151.359500 [silence]
sw3545A-ms98-a-0030 151.359500 152.760625 yeah
sw3545A-ms98-a-0031 152.760625 155.415375 [silence]
sw3545A-ms98-a-0032 155.415375 156.978000 right
sw3545A-ms98-a-0033 156.978000 160.806000 [silence]
sw3545A-ms98-a-0034 160.806000 171.628500 uh you know it's like i said i- i mean i've even had people at the office ask me they say how do you justify paying the kind of money you pay for rent because i do pay a lot of money every month for rent i don't deny it
sw3545A-ms98-a-0035 171.628500 179.327375 but at the same time i said well you know let's think about it [noise] i said i drive um less than ten miles a day round-trip
sw3545A-ms98-a-0036 179.327375 184.908750 and they go you know they're jaws dropped and then and then they go and i spend way less than thirty minutes a day
sw3545A-ms98-a-0037 184.908750 194.763625 round-trip commuting and you know that doesn't that's regardless of the weather if it's raining it still doesn't take me any longer i mean sometimes whenever and you know how Houston is it's just so flat
sw3545A-ms98-a-0038 194.763625 203.642250 and we have these torrential downpours sometimes and people literally get you know traffic gets backed up with the wrecks and everything and it'll take them_1 an hour and a half to get to work
sw3545A-ms98-a-0039 203.642250 210.197375 and they're just frayed by the [laughter-time] they get there i think no way so
sw3545A-ms98-a-0040 210.197375 226.006500 [silence]
sw3545A-ms98-a-0041 226.006500 227.515750 that's right
sw3545A-ms98-a-0042 227.515750 237.116000 [silence]
sw3545A-ms98-a-0043 237.116000 250.241750 oh i agree with you a hundred percent since i'm um [noise] mo[ved]- got this place i mean i used to i can remember years ago when i work[ed]- especially whenever i lived in Houston before i used to put twenty thousand miles a year on my car
sw3545A-ms98-a-0044 250.241750 253.423625 last year i put less than twelve on my car
sw3545A-ms98-a-0045 253.423625 258.464250 you know and you you can really tell a difference i mean i just don't you know it's just not
sw3545A-ms98-a-0046 258.464250 269.058875 i don't have that expense and by the time i cut down the the cost of my insurance because my car insurance is a little bit less by living so close then the additional automobile expense
sw3545A-ms98-a-0047 269.058875 280.763000 i don't know it's i- i thought about it [noise] it's i mean i would like to own again i've owned in the past but i don't know i'm i'm hesitant to give up the convenience
sw3545A-ms98-a-0048 280.763000 281.772750 [silence]
sw3545A-ms98-a-0049 281.772750 295.381375 [noise] plus where i live is so well managed i mean if i have any little thing go wrong i just pick up the phone at the office i call my manager i said we got this problem i come home in the afternoon there's a note on my dining room table saying we've been in we fixed it let us know if there's a problem
