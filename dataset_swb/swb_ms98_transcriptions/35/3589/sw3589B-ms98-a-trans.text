sw3589B-ms98-a-0026 113.215750 121.877625 and as long as you keep your statements then you know exactly what you've spent and if you know when you bought something because often i won't remember
sw3589B-ms98-a-0027 121.877625 131.121750 and i can go back you know i'll remember the month so i can go back to my my credit card invoice and there it is it tells me the exact date and everything
sw3589B-ms98-a-0028 131.121750 132.414125 [silence]
sw3589B-ms98-a-0029 132.414125 143.812500 well i have a whole slew of the them_1 but i really i use i have a Visa um but my Visa is an automatic draw from my credit from my
sw3589B-ms98-a-0030 143.812500 152.581875 yeah and so i don't either because it's gone although they don't debit it until the end of the month yeah
sw3589B-ms98-a-0031 152.581875 164.507250 um but it still automatically comes off that month if i time it right then any like [noise] my
sw3589B-ms98-a-0032 164.507250 178.784250 my date is the twelfth so if i charge something on the thirteenth then i don't get that bill till the end of the month and it's not due till before the twelfth of the next month so i can put off paying for something for free for two months
sw3589B-ms98-a-0033 178.784250 187.166750 no not with a debit card with my Discover card i can and and i use Discover more than any other because of the cash back 
sw3589B-ms98-a-0034 187.166750 197.475125 i have MasterCard and then i have all the different department stores but i just really never use them and i try desperately hard to pay it off each month
sw3589B-ms98-a-0035 197.475125 203.796625 because the the cost to use it is terrific
