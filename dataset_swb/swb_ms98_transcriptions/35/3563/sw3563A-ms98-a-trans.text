sw3563A-ms98-a-0003 3.867000 15.267500 and our top[ic]- okay our topic was did you hear our topic all right basketball i guess i'm [laughter-probably] [laughter-a] [laughter-lot] like you i'm a Dallas Maverick fan
sw3563A-ms98-a-0004 15.267500 19.610250 [silence]
sw3563A-ms98-a-0005 19.610250 31.343000 well unf[ortunately]- -[un]fortunately i don't expect a great deal out of them_1 they just have too many problems too many ailments [laughter-too] [laughter-many] hurt bones and maybe too much age at this point
sw3563A-ms98-a-0006 31.343000 43.342750 you know when Roy Tarpley just now he messed up on them_1 it just hurt them_1 so bad i feel like everyone else i feel sorry for Donald Carter and the owners of the team and the management of team and everyone else it just seems like
sw3563A-ms98-a-0007 43.342750 54.374750 they were just getting themselves in a position where they could possi[bly]- be a a final a final team playing for for all of it national championship or the world championship and something like this happens
sw3563A-ms98-a-0008 54.374750 61.686125 [silence]
sw3563A-ms98-a-0009 61.686125 67.183125 yeah i think at this time we're just in a a rebuilding type of phase you know i think
sw3563A-ms98-a-0010 67.183125 72.949125 that probably would be evident with the more and more the more and more young guys they draft
sw3563A-ms98-a-0011 72.949125 93.155875 [silence]
sw3563A-ms98-a-0012 93.155875 101.876125 oh gosh i'm so much of a [Magerick/Maverick] Maverick fan i don't know probably the Boston Celtics i've just always liked the Boston Celtics they have a
sw3563A-ms98-a-0013 101.876125 111.956625 they have a similar situation now that a lot of uh old guys on the team and but they're still playing good ball but i'm a i've always been a Boston Celtic fan too but
sw3563A-ms98-a-0014 111.956625 121.106625 you know i've lived in Texas since seventy four so being a transplanted Texan in in the Dallas area i have to stick with those Dallas Mavericks
sw3563A-ms98-a-0015 121.106625 122.731000 [silence]
sw3563A-ms98-a-0016 122.731000 125.072500 yes we do you know
sw3563A-ms98-a-0017 125.072500 132.674250 yes i go to a few games i haven't been to many i'm not a season ticket holder or anything i was a season ticket holder of the Cowboys for years and
sw3563A-ms98-a-0018 132.674250 142.334500 when my kids got to a certain age and went off to school college and doing their own thing sort of gets boring going by yourself [laughter]
sw3563A-ms98-a-0019 142.334500 144.220375 [silence]
sw3563A-ms98-a-0020 144.220375 146.160125 oh you bet
sw3563A-ms98-a-0021 146.160125 152.571250 [silence]
sw3563A-ms98-a-0022 152.571250 161.763125 well i don't know it seems like [noise] Rolando Blackman and and Harper sort of carry the team they just
sw3563A-ms98-a-0023 161.763125 172.985250 i don't know if i'm afraid to say that's probably who they need to trade to get someone in there good but and that can really help the team but they do that they trade the nucleus of their power right now
sw3563A-ms98-a-0024 172.985250 186.195250 [silence]
sw3563A-ms98-a-0025 186.195250 195.669000 well you know i feel like uh the best they can hope for this year is probably ah an opportunity to make the play-offs i like their coach i really like Richie a lot 
sw3563A-ms98-a-0026 195.669000 206.873875 and i just i think he deserves a good break he deserves a healthy team so they can really see what he can do for the club and i think Donald Carter the owner i think with all he's invested he deserves a
sw3563A-ms98-a-0027 206.873875 216.190625 a healthy team for one year and a good break also this thing with Roy Tarpley it just upset everyone i think fans owners management everyone
sw3563A-ms98-a-0028 216.190625 228.624750 [silence]
sw3563A-ms98-a-0029 228.624750 232.694000 you bet i think they're fools if they ever bring him back [laughter]
sw3563A-ms98-a-0030 232.694000 233.967500 [silence]
sw3563A-ms98-a-0031 233.967500 237.879250 hate to put it that way i just would not believe him anymore
sw3563A-ms98-a-0032 237.879250 242.612875 [silence]
sw3563A-ms98-a-0033 242.612875 244.272625 no [noise]
sw3563A-ms98-a-0034 244.272625 246.823250 [silence]
sw3563A-ms98-a-0035 246.823250 258.380500 there's an old saying you can l[ead]- you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink so and i think Tarpley's just a sad case but to be making ah a million dollars a year that's pretty sad
sw3563A-ms98-a-0036 258.380500 268.663750 [silence]
sw3563A-ms98-a-0037 268.663750 282.097750 oh i think you're right everything just been put out of perspective now you know you take a a young kid Roy Tarpley's age i'd say he was twenty one when he came into the league an[d]- and now he's probably an old age of uh twenty five or six
sw3563A-ms98-a-0038 282.097750 291.150875 and making all that money well that's uh that's quite a that's a little more of a challenge for a young man than they they need at that point in their life i think
sw3563A-ms98-a-0039 291.150875 292.829500 so
sw3563A-ms98-a-0040 292.829500 297.410000 so i think you know it's created by
