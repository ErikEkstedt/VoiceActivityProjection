sw3590A-ms98-a-0011 25.829625 27.946375 oh tough situation they're handling
sw3590A-ms98-a-0012 27.946375 32.579625 [silence]
sw3590A-ms98-a-0013 32.579625 35.246375 really they they gave him every chance possible with him
sw3590A-ms98-a-0014 35.246375 37.414750 [silence]
sw3590A-ms98-a-0015 37.414750 38.732125 is that right
sw3590A-ms98-a-0016 38.732125 40.885500 [silence]
sw3590A-ms98-a-0017 40.885500 44.060375 uh-huh uh he's talented player but uh
sw3590A-ms98-a-0018 44.060375 50.082125 [noise] i feel [noise] i don't know they seem to get involved in those substance abuse problems and it's a tough road for them
sw3590A-ms98-a-0019 50.082125 51.430750 [silence]
sw3590A-ms98-a-0020 51.430750 57.730000 well you know because i follow the Jazz fairly closely and then you know we're in the same conference
sw3590A-ms98-a-0021 57.730000 60.297750 you know keep tabs on them a little bit 
sw3590A-ms98-a-0022 60.297750 63.218375 they're doing well i uh
sw3590A-ms98-a-0023 63.218375 69.691625 they're in the in the head of the division and just won the last two road games they beat uh Philadelphia tonight
sw3590A-ms98-a-0024 69.691625 79.298250 it was a close one beat them by two points or three points but yeah they're doing they're doing great uh they had this little incident i don't know if you heard about it with uh Carl
sw3590A-ms98-a-0025 79.298250 81.661000 [vocalized-noise] Carl Malone and Isaiah Thomas
sw3590A-ms98-a-0026 81.661000 86.355875 there was a i guess they played last Friday here in Salt Lake
sw3590A-ms98-a-0027 86.355875 96.211125 and about the first two minutes of the game Isaiah drove in and Malone went up to block the shot and really fouled him hard so hard that it put him to the floor and he had like twenty stitches above his eye
sw3590A-ms98-a-0028 96.211125 102.367000 and uh they in reviewing the tapes decided it was a flagrant foul
sw3590A-ms98-a-0029 102.367000 106.996500 oh i guess they decided it was flagrant foul at the time of the ball game and ejected Carl
sw3590A-ms98-a-0030 106.996500 113.695750 and then he got a he got a ten thousand dollar fine and one game suspension which is about another thirty five thousand
sw3590A-ms98-a-0031 113.695750 123.132250 so it was a forty five [laughter-thousand] dollar deal for him and i i believe it was unintentional he fouled him hard but it wasn't like he had you know malicious intent to go cream the guy
sw3590A-ms98-a-0032 123.132250 134.979125 so there's been a big buzz about that how how Detroit's the bad boys of the league to begin with and when something like that happens to one of their players they're all all claiming that uh
sw3590A-ms98-a-0033 134.979125 140.762125 you know it was totally uncalled for this unnecessary violence when they've been guilty of that kind of thing for years
sw3590A-ms98-a-0034 140.762125 143.996000 Laimbeer and Rodman are about the two worst
sw3590A-ms98-a-0035 143.996000 146.801125 hatchet men in the league [laughter] so
sw3590A-ms98-a-0036 146.801125 148.639750 anyway
sw3590A-ms98-a-0037 148.639750 156.161875 [silence]
sw3590A-ms98-a-0038 156.161875 157.704875 oh is that right
sw3590A-ms98-a-0039 157.704875 158.920000 [silence]

sw3590A-ms98-a-0042 166.305875 171.905375 well yeah it it was probably [vocalized-noise] more local interest obviously but
sw3590A-ms98-a-0043 171.905375 175.912375 [silence]
sw3590A-ms98-a-0044 175.912375 182.035750 yeah and everybody's interested in seeing the little well it's just the nature of the human i guess to like to see a little violence [laughter] i think
sw3590A-ms98-a-0045 182.035750 183.053250 [silence]
sw3590A-ms98-a-0046 183.053250 184.469000 yeah

sw3590A-ms98-a-0049 189.285125 190.625250 that's true
sw3590A-ms98-a-0050 190.625250 191.924750 yeah
sw3590A-ms98-a-0051 191.924750 197.269000 well i've had about enough of Magic Johnson for the year though
sw3590A-ms98-a-0052 197.269000 204.930500 i guess where he's uh appears he's touring with the team and Jabbar's thinking of coming out of retirement to help fund the AIDS research and
sw3590A-ms98-a-0053 204.930500 207.432750 i don't know you hear both those stories
sw3590A-ms98-a-0054 207.432750 209.178625 [silence]
sw3590A-ms98-a-0055 209.178625 211.580750 i guess that's a nice gesture on Jabbar's part
sw3590A-ms98-a-0056 211.580750 213.003000 [silence]
sw3590A-ms98-a-0057 213.003000 214.040500 yeah
sw3590A-ms98-a-0058 214.040500 216.381625 [silence]

sw3590A-ms98-a-0068 238.119750 240.455625 you know some good come of it because of this
sw3590A-ms98-a-0069 240.455625 244.955250 you know it's a notoriety and focus that it'll have on the disease
