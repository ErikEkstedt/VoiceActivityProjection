sw3592A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 2.918375 [noise] well uh down here in we've got um
sw3592A-ms98-a-0002 2.918375 8.738750 trials by uh jury in criminal cases and the sentencing can be done by the
sw3592A-ms98-a-0003 8.738750 13.342125 jury normally although the judge can sometimes do it how do y'all do it up there
sw3592A-ms98-a-0004 13.342125 39.022375 [silence]
sw3592A-ms98-a-0005 39.022375 43.750750 we've got a lot of the[se]- uh in federal court they have a uniform sentencing
sw3592A-ms98-a-0006 43.750750 49.986375 guidelines that pretty well leave it up to the uh judge to assess the punishment in a certain range
sw3592A-ms98-a-0007 49.986375 60.126750 [silence]
sw3592A-ms98-a-0008 60.126750 68.880875 right here in the Dallas area if you are sentenced to ten years or less to incarceration in in the uh penitentiary
sw3592A-ms98-a-0009 68.880875 76.100000 you will never make it to the penitentiary and you'll serve about a year in the county jail and then be released because of the jail overcrowding
sw3592A-ms98-a-0010 76.100000 102.023000 [silence]
sw3592A-ms98-a-0011 102.023000 105.611750 well the judge has a better idea of what is
sw3592A-ms98-a-0012 105.611750 111.555750 probable ranges for that particular type of offense where a jury is just doing it for one time
sw3592A-ms98-a-0013 111.555750 119.851000 [silence]
sw3592A-ms98-a-0014 119.851000 129.107625 well you know in in civil cases they can have uh as few as ten of the jurors agree on a verdict but criminal normally requires unanimous
sw3592A-ms98-a-0015 129.107625 133.398750 they might make a change on that and that might make for fewer mistrials
sw3592A-ms98-a-0016 133.398750 145.984750 [silence]
sw3592A-ms98-a-0017 145.984750 156.394375 course in civil cases trial by jury doesn't necessarily work if you have a big complex uh business type case where a jury could get totally lost
sw3592A-ms98-a-0018 156.394375 162.567375 in a lot of those cases people decide to just try the case before a judge and just not have a jury
sw3592A-ms98-a-0019 162.567375 187.087625 [silence]
sw3592A-ms98-a-0020 187.087625 194.326000 and you had up there North Carolina that case of that lady who poisoning her various husbands what was it Blanchard or
sw3592A-ms98-a-0021 194.326000 196.422125 Blanche yes
sw3592A-ms98-a-0022 196.422125 199.035750 we've we've been reading about that
sw3592A-ms98-a-0023 199.035750 208.198500 [silence]
sw3592A-ms98-a-0024 208.198500 211.421625 no i don't remember reading about that
sw3592A-ms98-a-0025 211.421625 250.918875 [silence]
sw3592A-ms98-a-0026 250.918875 262.013125 [vocalized-noise] we've got a case going here where a man is accused of poisoning his wife with arsenic now and the jury the case went to the jury today and the jury's deliberating right now
sw3592A-ms98-a-0027 262.013125 287.922250 [silence]
sw3592A-ms98-a-0028 287.922250 291.647500 well the collective wisdom of the jury usually prevails
sw3592A-ms98-a-0029 291.647500 298.466000 [silence]
