sw3592B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.528000 [noise]
sw3592B-ms98-a-0002 0.528000 12.791750 [silence]
sw3592B-ms98-a-0003 12.791750 18.830625 um we usually do it uh the jury comes to the verdict and then the judge does the sentencing
sw3592B-ms98-a-0004 18.830625 23.537000 um i think the jury can recommend something but
sw3592B-ms98-a-0005 23.537000 32.436625 in [vocalized-noise] you know in some cases like uh murder in the first degree but i the ultimate decision is th[e]- is the decision of the judge once the
sw3592B-ms98-a-0006 32.436625 35.974750 verdict has been reached the jury's dismissed
sw3592B-ms98-a-0007 35.974750 39.466625 and there's a separate hearing for sentencing
sw3592B-ms98-a-0008 39.466625 50.026750 [silence]
sw3592B-ms98-a-0009 50.026750 51.246875 um-hum
sw3592B-ms98-a-0010 51.246875 57.134375 well i think it's curious that [vocalized-noise] the sentences that are handed down are usually not served
sw3592B-ms98-a-0011 57.134375 61.268250 i think that's a big problem with the criminal justice system but
sw3592B-ms98-a-0012 61.268250 74.792750 [silence]
sw3592B-ms98-a-0013 74.792750 76.871875 yeah
sw3592B-ms98-a-0014 76.871875 82.324125 well i i understand the jail overcrowding issue but [vocalized-noise]
sw3592B-ms98-a-0015 82.324125 91.904375 i- i think in i[n]- in that case a[s]- as as in so many all they ever do is discuss the problems and they never do anything to solve them_1
sw3592B-ms98-a-0016 91.904375 100.567250 i think that's why this country's in the shape it's in now but i i don't really believe that a jury
sw3592B-ms98-a-0017 100.567250 103.056750 should do the sentencing i think
sw3592B-ms98-a-0018 103.056750 110.622625 [silence]
sw3592B-ms98-a-0019 110.622625 114.045500 yeah i just don't believe that jurors have the
sw3592B-ms98-a-0020 114.045500 120.912875 the knowledge the scope and the knowledge [vocalized-noise] to to handle the sentencing whereas the judge does
sw3592B-ms98-a-0021 120.912875 133.025500 [silence]
sw3592B-ms98-a-0022 133.025500 136.070000 that's that's certainly true
sw3592B-ms98-a-0023 136.070000 145.694250 i just i- i mea[n]- i don't agree with juries doing the sentencing but i do agree with trial [noise] trial by jury i just think that's critical
sw3592B-ms98-a-0024 145.694250 162.037625 [silence]
sw3592B-ms98-a-0025 162.037625 169.089125 right well i think that can that makes sense too because_1 it looks like it would be awfully hard to pick
sw3592B-ms98-a-0026 169.089125 181.857125 jurors that could follow something as i[n]- in a civil case i mean that was really complicated and had a lot of technical issues in it but they [vocalized-noise] there are a lot of criminal cases a lot of murder cases an[d]-
sw3592B-ms98-a-0027 181.857125 186.885375 that [vocalized-noise] that are really very complicated and they seem to be able to get through those
sw3592B-ms98-a-0028 186.885375 193.525125 [silence]
sw3592B-ms98-a-0029 193.525125 195.469000 Blanche Taylor Moore
sw3592B-ms98-a-0030 195.469000 196.517125 yeah
sw3592B-ms98-a-0031 196.517125 198.455875 [silence]
sw3592B-ms98-a-0032 198.455875 204.184375 yeah we uh have you have you heard about [noise] trial that we've got going on now with the uh
sw3592B-ms98-a-0033 204.184375 208.789500 the man that's accused of molesting twenty three children at a day care center
sw3592B-ms98-a-0034 208.789500 209.969500 [silence]
sw3592B-ms98-a-0035 209.969500 216.750375 well that's the uh that's probably one of the biggest child [malestation/molestation] cases in the in the nation's history
sw3592B-ms98-a-0036 216.750375 224.132250 this man and his wife it it's a trial by jury but it's really going real ragged i don't understand how they're doing it
sw3592B-ms98-a-0037 224.132250 228.139875 and they go[t]- they he had a hundred and seventy eight charges against him
sw3592B-ms98-a-0038 228.139875 232.601625 and his attorney's managed to get it reduced to ninety three
sw3592B-ms98-a-0039 232.601625 238.533875 but the jury in that case they've just absolutely sequestered them_1
sw3592B-ms98-a-0040 238.533875 249.296000 nobody even unless you were paying attention at the very beginning you don't even know their names and they uh uh from what i've been reading in the paper they are the ones who are gonna
sw3592B-ms98-a-0041 249.296000 251.820000 do the sentencing in that
sw3592B-ms98-a-0042 251.820000 261.149625 [silence]
sw3592B-ms98-a-0043 261.149625 271.956500 arsenic is uh this this Blanche Taylor Moore woman was very clever she did it very slowly over a large period a long period of time at least it was
sw3592B-ms98-a-0044 271.956500 276.182625 it was done very slowly over a large period of time
sw3592B-ms98-a-0045 276.182625 278.592625 and since the jury has [vocalized-noise]
sw3592B-ms98-a-0046 278.592625 283.521000 [noise] found her guilty now the judge did the sentencing in that and she's appealing but
sw3592B-ms98-a-0047 283.521000 287.894625 i'm assuming that she's guilty because i really believe in the jury system
sw3592B-ms98-a-0048 287.894625 290.622750 [silence]
sw3592B-ms98-a-0049 290.622750 295.431500 yeah hopefully they're smart enough not to be hoodwinked by
sw3592B-ms98-a-0050 295.431500 298.466000 illegal ploys by lawyers and prosecut[ors]-
