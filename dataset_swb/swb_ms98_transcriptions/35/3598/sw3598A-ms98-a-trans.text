sw3598A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.067500 [noise]
sw3598A-ms98-a-0002 0.067500 1.440000 well do you like to sail
sw3598A-ms98-a-0003 1.440000 6.019875 [silence]
sw3598A-ms98-a-0004 6.019875 7.273125 yeah
sw3598A-ms98-a-0005 7.273125 8.318250 well that
sw3598A-ms98-a-0006 8.318250 13.174000 oh i love to sail i have a i was first introduced to it when i was in Atlanta
sw3598A-ms98-a-0007 13.174000 14.346250 [silence]
sw3598A-ms98-a-0008 14.346250 23.645000 oh gosh in the late seventies i had a neighbor who had a little seventeen foot day sailor that we used to go out on Lake Lanier north of Atlanta just about every weekend in the summertime
sw3598A-ms98-a-0009 23.645000 26.170875 and it was just more fun than a barrel of monkeys
sw3598A-ms98-a-0010 26.170875 31.997000 and just loved it and then uh i i don't know it i had never sailed before and i took to it like the
sw3598A-ms98-a-0011 31.997000 36.146750 um that was um twenty five or so
sw3598A-ms98-a-0012 36.146750 38.136750 and then i was transferred to Houston
sw3598A-ms98-a-0013 38.136750 52.472625 and as luck would have it uh one of my cohorts at work uh was partner uh with another guy who had a forty two foot uh Tarten as a matter of fact he still has it and so i got to go sailing a lot uh
sw3598A-ms98-a-0014 52.472625 65.505250 on that we've been down to Corpus and over to um i've been on the Pensacola yacht race and just in a whole little bit of gulf sailing and uh it's spectacular um i just it's one of my favorite very favorite things to do
sw3598A-ms98-a-0015 65.505250 66.588750 [silence]
sw3598A-ms98-a-0016 66.588750 69.161125 well once you get out
sw3598A-ms98-a-0017 69.161125 77.302250 well now sure i've i've been [vocalized-noise] whenever it was just horrendous i mean when we went out in storms and then again i've been out there whenever it's just almost 
sw3598A-ms98-a-0018 77.302250 90.772250 you know just real light light waves i mean it's it's varied from one extreme to the other but whenever you get out away from the shoreline out in the blue water and the you know the dolphin start swimming along beside the boat and it uh it's wonderful
sw3598A-ms98-a-0019 90.772250 97.208125 and of course that's the best of all possible worlds because i don't have to pay upkeep on it or any [laughter]
sw3598A-ms98-a-0020 97.208125 103.051875 because honey you know that that there's a saying you know what's a sailboat it's a hole in the water that you throw money into 
sw3598A-ms98-a-0021 103.051875 105.472125 [laughter] yeah [laughter]
sw3598A-ms98-a-0022 105.472125 112.317500 well uh the guy the guy my friend who owns the boat that's what he professes that he said yeah then he said
sw3598A-ms98-a-0023 112.317500 113.738875 [silence]
sw3598A-ms98-a-0024 113.738875 114.618000 yeah it is
sw3598A-ms98-a-0025 114.618000 127.316000 yeah it really is and uh he also says uh uh sailing is is uh a way to go uh nowhere fast uh uh no to go to go nowhere at very slow speeds at very great expense [laughter] 
sw3598A-ms98-a-0026 127.316000 141.117500 [silence]
sw3598A-ms98-a-0027 141.117500 148.676500 well oh yeah and i agree with you a hundred percent i mean i have after having sailed a little bit i just have no interest at all in a power boat and
sw3598A-ms98-a-0028 148.676500 149.685750 [silence]
sw3598A-ms98-a-0029 149.685750 163.515125 yeah and it's just you know the whole idea of getting out there and uh making [vocalized-noise] you know fine tuning the sails and trimming and and adjusting just to to eke out a little more speed from the wind
sw3598A-ms98-a-0030 163.515125 171.511500 and uh just have and i don't know just the whole you you you well and you're closer to nature too than having a big throbbing engine behind you
sw3598A-ms98-a-0031 171.511500 185.487750 and uh i i really do love it i've got uh um my company uh has some a facility in Aruba and i'm going down there in uh this spring and i hope to get a chance to do a little sailing down there
sw3598A-ms98-a-0032 185.487750 188.134000 exactly yeah yeah
sw3598A-ms98-a-0033 188.134000 197.719750 so one of the things i think i may even try is uh uh you know the the little sail board with the what they call it
sw3598A-ms98-a-0034 197.719750 199.172000 ye[ah]- 
sw3598A-ms98-a-0035 199.172000 202.118250 wind sailing yeah whatever but
sw3598A-ms98-a-0036 202.118250 205.363250 i don't you know i'm not quite sure if i'm ready to try that or not i
sw3598A-ms98-a-0037 205.363250 206.954125 [silence]
sw3598A-ms98-a-0038 206.954125 208.126250 yeah
sw3598A-ms98-a-0039 208.126250 216.136125 [silence]
sw3598A-ms98-a-0040 216.136125 217.281250 yeah
sw3598A-ms98-a-0041 217.281250 218.257500 [noise]
sw3598A-ms98-a-0042 218.257500 227.368125 yeah and i i have heard people talk that that uh you know you almost have to have lessons and then it's really you know not easy to master those uh those
sw3598A-ms98-a-0043 227.368125 235.816375 it rea[lly]- it really does but again it looks like something that looks how it maybe like roller skating would be it looks like a lot of fun but not that easy [laughter-to] [laughter-do]
sw3598A-ms98-a-0044 235.816375 237.152250 [silence]
sw3598A-ms98-a-0045 237.152250 238.778875 no i never have
sw3598A-ms98-a-0046 238.778875 240.291375 [silence]
sw3598A-ms98-a-0047 240.291375 241.769625 yeah right
sw3598A-ms98-a-0048 241.769625 244.452250 [silence]
sw3598A-ms98-a-0049 244.452250 245.567500 uh-huh
sw3598A-ms98-a-0050 245.567500 246.617500 [silence]
sw3598A-ms98-a-0051 246.617500 261.022250 yeah right right but uh anyway that's uh sort of the the extent of my water sports but i i do i find sailing just to be uh one of the best ways for me to get out and relax -[a]nd
sw3598A-ms98-a-0052 261.022250 265.541750 [silence]
sw3598A-ms98-a-0053 265.541750 269.809500 ye[ah]- yeah i have considered it and at the same time it's um
sw3598A-ms98-a-0054 269.809500 279.105625 where i live in Houston it's in order to to really get the use out of it i would need to move down near Cle[ar]- Clear Lake closer to the water
sw3598A-ms98-a-0055 279.105625 287.886125 and uh that would mean commuting up the Gulf Freeway every morning into downtown and and i'm i live so close to the office that i'm just not
sw3598A-ms98-a-0056 287.886125 299.170000 i don't know the idea of having to commute on a freeway in Houston every day even as much as i would like to have access to a boat you know more often than i do yeah it's it's just not that
