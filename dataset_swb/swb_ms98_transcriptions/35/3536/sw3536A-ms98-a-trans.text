sw3536A-ms98-a-0010 29.458000 35.763875 but you know h[ow]- i used to subscribe to Texas Highways that's one of the best magazines for the money going
sw3536A-ms98-a-0011 35.763875 40.296000 i mean it's such a bargain what w[hat]- i mean what is it like twelve dollars a year
sw3536A-ms98-a-0012 40.296000 43.502125 and then the photography's beautiful
sw3536A-ms98-a-0013 43.502125 54.495125 yeah it's m[atter]- that's i thought about it not too long ago that uh [noise] i had seen an issue and i thought gosh i ought to give my parents that for Christmas but i of course now it's Christmas i haven't done it so maybe next year
sw3536A-ms98-a-0014 54.495125 59.911250 uh but i know i had i had uh found myself about i don't know two years ago 
sw3536A-ms98-a-0015 59.911250 68.243875 in the in a situation where i- i literally had more magazines coming in than i could read and i thought this is crazy so i
sw3536A-ms98-a-0016 68.243875 71.907125 [silence]
sw3536A-ms98-a-0017 71.907125 73.552125 uh-huh
sw3536A-ms98-a-0018 73.552125 75.000250 yeah
sw3536A-ms98-a-0019 75.000250 76.030250 [silence]
sw3536A-ms98-a-0020 76.030250 81.429375 well i- i took Time for i guess ten years
sw3536A-ms98-a-0021 81.429375 89.284375 and i enjoyed it and it and i it you know it has just um you know a wealth of information i mean it's therefore similar to Newsweek 
sw3536A-ms98-a-0022 89.284375 97.268000 but whenever i got to the point that i j[ust]- i just finally said this is just insane because i had so many magazines i let them_1 all lapse
sw3536A-ms98-a-0023 97.268000 104.322875 and then once they were all gone and of course that took a while i didn't realize how much i had paid up on some of them_1
sw3536A-ms98-a-0024 104.322875 112.063250 and uh then i decided well i you know Vanity Fair offered me a special thing to come back at a reduced rate you know
sw3536A-ms98-a-0025 112.063250 121.810625 and then Harper's did and so i you know little by little i've i've you know subscribed to a few more again [noise] but uh i take the newspaper everyday
sw3536A-ms98-a-0026 121.810625 124.630500 so i've got plenty of reading material
sw3536A-ms98-a-0027 124.630500 127.541000 [silence]
sw3536A-ms98-a-0028 127.541000 128.757375 yeah
sw3536A-ms98-a-0029 128.757375 130.594250 yeah yeah
sw3536A-ms98-a-0030 130.594250 133.993875 [silence]
sw3536A-ms98-a-0031 133.993875 138.439125 well you sound though kind of like me though but i mean it's um i'm i have 
sw3536A-ms98-a-0032 138.439125 141.883125 always plenty of reading material around my house
sw3536A-ms98-a-0033 141.883125 152.732500 and when i go to visit my brother and sister-in-law in Austin it drives me crazy because i- i always have to be sure and put something in my suitcase to read because honestly i wonder these people don't ever read
sw3536A-ms98-a-0034 152.732500 157.557875 yeah i mean their house just a you know it's just it's it's appalling to me they have nothing to read
sw3536A-ms98-a-0035 157.557875 158.562625 [silence]
sw3536A-ms98-a-0036 158.562625 168.926750 yeah really we[ll]- uh well actually i think one year uh several years ago i did give them_1 a a subscription to Time and they never said a word about it you know and so i thought well maybe they they were 
sw3536A-ms98-a-0037 168.926750 173.057375 maybe they weren't into it you know that's fine but it's just it's so different than
sw3536A-ms98-a-0038 173.057375 177.849000 you kn[ow]- i just i require reading material that's all that is to it
sw3536A-ms98-a-0039 177.849000 186.032500 [silence]
sw3536A-ms98-a-0040 186.032500 187.433500 uh-huh
sw3536A-ms98-a-0041 187.433500 194.685000 [silence]
sw3536A-ms98-a-0042 194.685000 196.647250 uh-huh
sw3536A-ms98-a-0043 196.647250 204.541500 yeah well i um [noise] you know i had as a matter of fact the the Vanity Fair whenever i let it lapse
sw3536A-ms98-a-0044 204.541500 210.554250 they had sent me all these you know final notice uh things and i just you know didn't send them_1 back in 
sw3536A-ms98-a-0045 210.554250 216.397375 and so finally once i did decide to subscribe again
sw3536A-ms98-a-0046 216.397375 217.440750 [silence]
sw3536A-ms98-a-0047 217.440750 226.321875 i sent in a a thing that said hey you know i mean it was whatever the the uh subscription rate was i think like fifteen dollars
sw3536A-ms98-a-0048 226.321875 236.466000 and [vocalized-noise] about a month later i got a thing in the mail saying well hey as a former subscriber you can now get it for twelve and they had a one eight hundred number i called up and i said hey i want three bucks back
sw3536A-ms98-a-0049 236.466000 242.470750 so they extended they said they were gonna extend my subscription for three months but they're pretty competitive
sw3536A-ms98-a-0050 242.470750 255.444875 [silence]
sw3536A-ms98-a-0051 255.444875 256.668500 yeah
sw3536A-ms98-a-0052 256.668500 271.018625 [silence]
sw3536A-ms98-a-0053 271.018625 278.837375 oh it is it is and it just but at the same time you can [noise] you can get information i mean there there [noise]
sw3536A-ms98-a-0054 278.837375 287.599250 the variety and you can get different types of information and and you know television is is geared so much to
sw3536A-ms98-a-0055 287.599250 294.987500 the average Joe Blow and quite frankly i mean there there are items of interest to me that you'll never find on television
sw3536A-ms98-a-0056 294.987500 298.626000 [silence]
