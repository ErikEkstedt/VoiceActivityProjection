sw3586A-ms98-a-0003 15.462125 18.687750 [silence]
sw3586A-ms98-a-0004 18.687750 19.905000 um-hum
sw3586A-ms98-a-0005 19.905000 23.123250 [silence]
sw3586A-ms98-a-0006 23.123250 24.418375 um-hum
sw3586A-ms98-a-0007 24.418375 30.921875 [noise] um i try to do some painting although i'm not very good at it [laughter-um]
sw3586A-ms98-a-0008 30.921875 34.346875 i well no [laughter-not] [laughter-really]
sw3586A-ms98-a-0009 34.346875 44.875625 yeah i i have you know i inherited the genes that make me think i'm creative but not the ones that give me the ability to be [laughter-so] [laughter-i] [laughter-always] [laughter-try]
sw3586A-ms98-a-0010 44.875625 51.522000 i i do some sewing mostly out of necessity um i'm making drapes for my house just because_1 i'm
sw3586A-ms98-a-0011 51.522000 61.761000 yeah well it isn't and it is it is you know actually the sewing isn't the hard part it's just being able to lay out the material and measure it because_1 you need so much room
sw3586A-ms98-a-0012 61.761000 63.979000 [silence]
sw3586A-ms98-a-0013 63.979000 74.316250 yeah i've been doing that and that yeah that but usually i have to do the pleats by hand so that at least i can do i[t]- you know watching TV or whatever but
sw3586A-ms98-a-0014 74.316250 79.831250 yeah and i've i've gone and you know put the needle through my thumb a few [laughter-times] trying to get it through but
sw3586A-ms98-a-0015 79.831250 85.499250 yeah so that's not really my favorite thing to do or anything but i i need to do it
sw3586A-ms98-a-0016 85.499250 92.606875 i have let's see i have a dog and a lot of fish keeping fish i guess is my biggest hobby and
sw3586A-ms98-a-0017 92.606875 94.299000 [silence]
sw3586A-ms98-a-0018 94.299000 101.362750 um yes [laughter-and] no it depends on and how frequently they die and how much that bothers you [laughter]
sw3586A-ms98-a-0019 101.362750 103.959875 [silence]
sw3586A-ms98-a-0020 103.959875 111.325500 that's you don't do as much as as i thought in fact my problem i had fish as a kid and they always died
sw3586A-ms98-a-0021 111.325500 116.429500 i mean immediately and what i'm what i think now is the reason is i kept the tank too clean
sw3586A-ms98-a-0022 116.429500 122.556875 because you have right you need to let the bacteria build up and then it keeps all the chemicals in balance
sw3586A-ms98-a-0023 122.556875 133.207625 and i would just take everything out and just like you know wash it with scalding hot water and and it would kill all the bacteria and that would screw up all the chemical cycles again so
sw3586A-ms98-a-0024 133.207625 134.710875 right
sw3586A-ms98-a-0025 134.710875 143.141125 that's right so now all i i only clean things to make things look more aesthetically pleasing and i don't try and sterilize [laughter-things]
sw3586A-ms98-a-0026 143.141125 144.827625 that's right
sw3586A-ms98-a-0027 144.827625 146.254750 [silence]
sw3586A-ms98-a-0028 146.254750 148.372000 that's right
sw3586A-ms98-a-0029 148.372000 161.320500 well i've had them_1 i guess it's been two years now i've had a a tank here and and then back at home i used to have a small you know five gallon tank but that never worked well and
sw3586A-ms98-a-0030 161.320500 165.646250 i have fifty five gallons now it's a lot easier
sw3586A-ms98-a-0031 165.646250 166.901875 [silence]
sw3586A-ms98-a-0032 166.901875 170.560625 no [laughter] no not yet
sw3586A-ms98-a-0033 170.560625 171.678625 [silence]
sw3586A-ms98-a-0034 171.678625 174.851250 that's right i really do but you know
sw3586A-ms98-a-0035 174.851250 186.045500 yeah i just have you know what they call community fish you know guppies and platies and and basic things i don't get into the ex[pensive]- right right the expensive ones
sw3586A-ms98-a-0036 186.045500 187.494375 [silence]
sw3586A-ms98-a-0037 187.494375 196.855000 they are and they're very expensive and you know when you die it's like it when when they die it's more like an investment you've lost an investment so
sw3586A-ms98-a-0038 196.855000 199.017625 [silence]
sw3586A-ms98-a-0039 199.017625 204.100625 no not really only if there's baby fish you always have to isolate those
sw3586A-ms98-a-0040 204.100625 205.248750 [silence]
sw3586A-ms98-a-0041 205.248750 206.716375 you get um
sw3586A-ms98-a-0042 206.716375 212.291375 well no they have uh breeders it's a little plastic thing that sort of floats
sw3586A-ms98-a-0043 212.291375 224.640000 and you put the mother fish in there and then it's got like a trough underneath her so as the babies come out they fall down the trough and there's a hole in the middle so they fall onto the bottom part of the chamber so the mother can't get to them either
sw3586A-ms98-a-0044 224.640000 233.022375 and that's you know it it kind of works but it's also got slots in it so the water can circulate and on occasion if you get a real small one it'll fit out the slots
sw3586A-ms98-a-0045 233.022375 237.585125 that's right so but you know it works i guess
sw3586A-ms98-a-0046 237.585125 238.814875 yeah
sw3586A-ms98-a-0047 238.814875 240.577250 [silence]
sw3586A-ms98-a-0048 240.577250 243.378000 oh they'll eat them yeah
sw3586A-ms98-a-0049 243.378000 249.608250 yes it and it's funny because_1 the one i have every single month without fail she has babies
sw3586A-ms98-a-0050 249.608250 258.570375 and oh no a[ll]- all the time and um i've and she's supposed to her variety it says they won't eat the babies and i've seen her do it
sw3586A-ms98-a-0051 258.570375 259.866125 so
sw3586A-ms98-a-0052 259.866125 271.637625 [vocalized-noise] oh it's terr[ible]- well i mean it makes you understand that you know things are different [laughter-you] [laughter-know] we might right we might decide what's proper and what isn't but you know that's the way it is for them
sw3586A-ms98-a-0053 271.637625 273.696875 yeah that's it
sw3586A-ms98-a-0054 273.696875 279.211500 yeah because if the baby's strong enough it can swim away fast enough and go hide
sw3586A-ms98-a-0055 279.211500 280.287875 [silence]
sw3586A-ms98-a-0056 280.287875 281.020750 so
sw3586A-ms98-a-0057 281.020750 281.101625 [noise]
sw3586A-ms98-a-0058 281.101625 283.005250 [silence]
sw3586A-ms98-a-0059 283.005250 285.109000 yeah yeah
sw3586A-ms98-a-0060 285.109000 288.160375 [silence]
sw3586A-ms98-a-0061 288.160375 290.290125 yeah yeah
sw3586A-ms98-a-0062 290.290125 292.011875 [silence]
sw3586A-ms98-a-0063 292.011875 292.907875 huh
sw3586A-ms98-a-0064 292.907875 294.168750 [silence]
sw3586A-ms98-a-0065 294.168750 298.914000 no not really i i try i a[lso]- i also i play a couple of instruments
