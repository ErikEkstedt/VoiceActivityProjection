sw3503B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.942000 [noise]
sw3503B-ms98-a-0002 0.942000 8.808875 [laughter] well i wa[s]- i just last Friday got off a capital murder case yeah was on the jury
sw3503B-ms98-a-0003 8.808875 22.682125 um yeah [laughter] which is funny because i got called last night and the topic was uh something about juries [laughter] yeah so i'm just hitting it right um how do i feel about it i- i don't know well
sw3503B-ms98-a-0004 22.682125 36.121000 i guess it's right in certain cases um becau[se]- well the one i was just on i don't i was an alternate on the case so i don't know what was decided they're probably still in deliberations on it
sw3503B-ms98-a-0005 36.121000 49.486000 but um what i found out once once i was declared an alternate and i was dismissed we met with the judge the two alternates did and uh he went on to tell us how they happened to catch this guy and i remember hearing about it it was about a year ago um
sw3503B-ms98-a-0006 49.486000 60.233625 he wa[s]- he was involved in another one another capital murder the very next month and he was caught just they they drove up the police drove up just as he fired the gu[n]- gun and killed the guy
sw3503B-ms98-a-0007 60.233625 72.419000 so he was caught and uh it's interesting because the county i live in i'm not in Dallas county i'm i'm pretty far north of Dallas um the county i live in in the past ten years only had t[wo]- two capital murders
sw3503B-ms98-a-0008 72.419000 81.693875 and last year there were six and this guy is indicted on three of them yeah so you have to [laughter-wonder] [laughter-you] [laughter-know] [vocalized-noise]
sw3503B-ms98-a-0009 81.693875 83.265125 yeah
sw3503B-ms98-a-0010 83.265125 84.744625 [silence]
sw3503B-ms98-a-0011 84.744625 92.755250 yeah although you know it's not really revenge because it doesn't mean anything to him you know he he has no concept of what he's done
sw3503B-ms98-a-0012 92.755250 101.357125 he just well from what i can tell i mean i didn't talk to the guy or anything but i mean he doesn't seem to have any regard for anythi[ng]- anybody's life including his own
sw3503B-ms98-a-0013 101.357125 105.488875 so it's it's kind of strange it you know
sw3503B-ms98-a-0014 105.488875 107.423375 no huh-uh
sw3503B-ms98-a-0015 107.423375 111.738500 [silence]
sw3503B-ms98-a-0016 111.738500 112.859000 yeah
sw3503B-ms98-a-0017 112.859000 122.643375 yeah well it's funny because when you know they interview you before you go on the jury and for capital murder i- i was interviewed by four attorneys for about_1 five hours
sw3503B-ms98-a-0018 122.643375 133.640000 and i the i was the i think the ninety eighth [laughter-person] [laughter-they'd] [laughter-interviewed] but you know at the time when the guy kept saying could you ever convict someone and do you think you'd ever know beyond a doubt 
sw3503B-ms98-a-0019 133.640000 144.059625 and i said i can't imagine i said if i knew beyond a doubt or if i felt beyond a doubt that he had done it yeah i guess i could c[onvict]- convict him but i can't imagine you ever making me that sure of something 
sw3503B-ms98-a-0020 144.059625 147.244375 but they really did it was it was really amazing
sw3503B-ms98-a-0021 147.244375 149.034375 [silence]
sw3503B-ms98-a-0022 149.034375 161.563625 well that was a subsequent case that we didn't know about and those jurors don't know about [noise] but this particular case i mean they had a complete confession from the guy with a lot of things that the police hadn't released so no one else would have known 
sw3503B-ms98-a-0023 161.563625 165.565250 yes it was really pretty interesting it's educational
sw3503B-ms98-a-0024 165.565250 169.552500 [silence]
sw3503B-ms98-a-0025 169.552500 178.473625 well they can['t]- they can i think in the punishment phase but not in the guilt or innocence because he hasn't been he hasn't been found guilty of it
sw3503B-ms98-a-0026 178.473625 180.203875 right
sw3503B-ms98-a-0027 180.203875 186.614750 right so [laughter-you] [laughter-know] it's although it's not gonna take much to prove that so
sw3503B-ms98-a-0028 186.614750 188.032125 yeah
sw3503B-ms98-a-0029 188.032125 189.036625 [silence]
sw3503B-ms98-a-0030 189.036625 191.948875 um yeah this guy's up for death penalty
sw3503B-ms98-a-0031 191.948875 204.610500 um and in Texas there's there's a couple of questions you have to ask um in the punishment phase um for example was the guy provoked and was the response reasonable given the provocation
sw3503B-ms98-a-0032 204.610500 217.736875 and there's a number of questions and just depending on whether you say yes or no um you m[ay]- you can give him capital punishment and if you're up to the point where if he still qualifies for capital punishment then you can look at mitigating circumstances
sw3503B-ms98-a-0033 217.736875 223.892125 so there's a lot of outs but the only result is otherwise he gets life in prison and
sw3503B-ms98-a-0034 223.892125 224.929125 [silence]
sw3503B-ms98-a-0035 224.929125 226.845250 yeah [laughter]
sw3503B-ms98-a-0036 226.845250 232.982500 right and and to me i mean you take away a person's freedom you've taken away most of their life
sw3503B-ms98-a-0037 232.982500 234.575500 so
sw3503B-ms98-a-0038 234.575500 241.401875 yeah but but then you have to look at reality i mean i think you know normally they they may get out so
sw3503B-ms98-a-0039 241.401875 248.983875 but what's it worth i don't know personally [laughter-i] [laughter-don't] [laughter-know] [laughter-if] [laughter-which] i would pick if i had a choice for [laughter-myself] that'd be interesting
sw3503B-ms98-a-0040 248.983875 250.673500 yeah
sw3503B-ms98-a-0041 250.673500 251.854875 yeah
sw3503B-ms98-a-0042 251.854875 256.327000 so you said you're from Mississippi and do they have the death penalty there
sw3503B-ms98-a-0043 256.327000 259.624625 [silence]
