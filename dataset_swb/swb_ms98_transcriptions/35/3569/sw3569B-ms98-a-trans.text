sw3569B-ms98-a-0038 207.940875 217.614000 no well no i- i- i- i i primarily deal with the state employees but i- i find interesting tidbits in what the news reports as far as
sw3569B-ms98-a-0039 217.614000 226.209500 the like the state of uh uh North Carolina's budget and stuff like that and i- i really know what the budget is and a[nd]- and
sw3569B-ms98-a-0040 226.209500 238.828500 uh uh when they were saying we were so poor and they couldn't pay taxes and to pay people their income tax refunds and stuff like that and you know i'm well aware of the billions of assets the that the state has and i[t's]- i[t's]- i[t's]- it's just funny
sw3569B-ms98-a-0041 238.828500 251.027875 y[ou]- you know so that['s]- that['s]- that['s]- that's so i don't have a whole lot of faith in in you know the news of course it's they they get what they hear from but you know it's not always i- i think one hundred percent reliable
sw3569B-ms98-a-0042 251.027875 258.724375 [silence]
sw3569B-ms98-a-0043 258.724375 271.235875 i think they need to do a little bit uh go into a little bit more depth uh a[nd]- before they would just report like somebody wants to make a statement or something like that because_1 i mean another example is the uh
sw3569B-ms98-a-0044 271.235875 283.718000 AIDS issue or whatever tha[t]- you know someone said oh i found a cure they immediately the headlines on the news or whatever is so and so has found a cure for AIDS and then two months later it's discovered it's not you know it's
sw3569B-ms98-a-0045 283.718000 291.435000 uh before they before they come out with something like that they need to to research the th[e]- the matter i believe a little bit more
sw3569B-ms98-a-0046 291.435000 294.236500 [silence]
sw3569B-ms98-a-0047 294.236500 295.533125 well that tha[t]-
