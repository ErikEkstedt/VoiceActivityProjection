sw3542B-ms98-a-0017 58.688875 63.779375 that those that aren't you know that aren't either morally or or politically or
sw3542B-ms98-a-0018 63.779375 69.484875 going to do a good job that they're they're trying to get them_1 out of it or at least they're taking a stand
sw3542B-ms98-a-0019 69.484875 72.580250 against it so um
sw3542B-ms98-a-0020 72.580250 79.608625 i know [laughter] a lot of the well in our community you know the government the leaders here
sw3542B-ms98-a-0021 79.608625 85.542125 i feel like they're all all real good people that are trying their best to to provide a service to the community and
sw3542B-ms98-a-0022 85.542125 89.195000 when you think that most of the most of the politicians
sw3542B-ms98-a-0023 89.195000 94.585625 i'm i'm not really sure what the pay scales are and and how that that works but
sw3542B-ms98-a-0024 94.585625 102.168875 um i don't agree with some of the ways that they they earn extra money on the side [laughter] you know i feel that
sw3542B-ms98-a-0025 102.168875 108.774500 that that that needs to be changed and and they should have more accounting on the different ways that they
sw3542B-ms98-a-0026 108.774500 119.556000 they earn their money have you ever ran for a public office probably not yeah probably not being twenty two [laughter] not yet um my husband ran one time here in uh
sw3542B-ms98-a-0027 119.556000 123.438000 our little community and he ran you know for the town board and
sw3542B-ms98-a-0028 123.438000 127.505875 and we felt like it was a a real good experience i think that
sw3542B-ms98-a-0029 127.505875 128.737625 um
sw3542B-ms98-a-0030 128.737625 131.835500 you know when people are wanting to get involved to
sw3542B-ms98-a-0031 131.835500 136.592375 to to make changes for the better in the community that it's

sw3542B-ms98-a-0036 151.826375 162.903375 yeah yeah that does worry me [laughter] especially when with his background you know and the people have already voted him down i- i don't understand really
sw3542B-ms98-a-0037 162.903375 166.239000 really his reasons for doing that i don't
sw3542B-ms98-a-0038 166.239000 168.289750 i don't know what he's
sw3542B-ms98-a-0039 168.289750 169.863125 [silence]
sw3542B-ms98-a-0040 169.863125 171.320750 really
sw3542B-ms98-a-0041 171.320750 175.878500 [laughter-that's] [laughter-right] yeah i was i'm interested in um
sw3542B-ms98-a-0042 175.878500 187.371750 our state is looking for a new governor and we have had oh i think the number is seven already that are running for it and this is not until next year that have put you know their hat in in in the ring to run and
sw3542B-ms98-a-0043 187.371750 194.845875 and i was surprised by that because it had seemed to me like there was almost getting to be that it was hard to get people to run because of the reason that
sw3542B-ms98-a-0044 194.845875 198.255625 you know they dredge up every single thing in your past
sw3542B-ms98-a-0045 198.255625 205.677625 i mean and not very many people want to lay their their whole life on the line like that and say hey i you know i've never made any mistakes and
sw3542B-ms98-a-0046 205.677625 208.705250 i think that would be a little bit frightening to
sw3542B-ms98-a-0047 208.705250 214.782875 to be put in the public eye like that myself but we've had it here in the state a lot of people that are going to run for
sw3542B-ms98-a-0048 214.782875 220.811000 for governor and it seems like there's a lot of people that are starting to talk about running for president again
sw3542B-ms98-a-0049 220.811000 223.282375 you know when when Bush is
sw3542B-ms98-a-0050 223.282375 225.518000 when he's finished so
