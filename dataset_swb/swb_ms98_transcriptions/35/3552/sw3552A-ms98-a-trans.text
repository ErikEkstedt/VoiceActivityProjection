sw3552A-ms98-a-0016 53.390250 67.252875 i guess three years [noise] and you know [vocalized-noise] looking back i'm i'm really happy that i had that experience because certainly i i learned some basics about music that i would've been completely ignorant of had i not had those lessons [noise]
sw3552A-ms98-a-0017 67.252875 78.948875 um i i wish now of course you know in [vocalized-noise] in hindsight that i had [noise] uh uh uh kept it up but i didn't but nonetheless i i do have some uh rudimentary knowledge of uh

sw3552A-ms98-a-0023 105.161000 115.940750 repertoire [noise] i mean i've i've got everything from classical to jazz or rock and roll to blues i mean it's just i i cover the whole gamut and it depends on the mood i'm in uh [noise]
sw3552A-ms98-a-0024 115.940750 128.714875 and for instance Sunday mornings with coffee and the newspaper i [noise] for some reason like to listen to classical music [noise] and uh other times it you know just something completely different will strike me i i like almost everything except rap

sw3552A-ms98-a-0030 156.463375 160.422000 you know that's just i don't relate to it at all but then again i'm that's
sw3552A-ms98-a-0031 160.422000 164.342250 it it's definitely a a huge hit with the younger people
