sw3574B-ms98-a-0003 4.610750 8.106625 w[e]- we we have a terrible air pollution problem
sw3574B-ms98-a-0004 8.106625 15.732375 our summers are extremely uh hazardous and during ah certain
sw3574B-ms98-a-0005 15.732375 22.996500 wind directions because we get the uh Gary Indiana Chicago pollution
sw3574B-ms98-a-0006 22.996500 29.933375 and we can look out on the lake and just see the brown haze uh coming up along the lake
sw3574B-ms98-a-0007 29.933375 39.900125 and they do post uh uh warnings for people who have uh heart diseases or respiratory problems
sw3574B-ms98-a-0008 39.900125 43.906000 during that summer season in the winter it's not as severe
sw3574B-ms98-a-0009 43.906000 49.573000 but uh if the wind comes basically from the south it can be really bad
sw3574B-ms98-a-0010 49.573000 58.762250 uh the state of Wisconsin as a matter of fact uh started some litigation against Illinois because of the air pollution we were getting
sw3574B-ms98-a-0011 58.762250 67.733750 ah i don't think it's gonna go very far but it it was uh a way of ah triggering uh awareness
sw3574B-ms98-a-0012 67.733750 71.124000 so what's the conditions like in Dallas
sw3574B-ms98-a-0013 71.124000 98.960750 [silence]
sw3574B-ms98-a-0014 98.960750 100.161250 um
sw3574B-ms98-a-0015 100.161250 110.750375 [silence]
sw3574B-ms98-a-0016 110.750375 111.655375 [noise]
sw3574B-ms98-a-0017 111.655375 119.831625 [noise] Wisconsin has a a law in which we need to take our cars in every year when we apply for a new license tag
sw3574B-ms98-a-0018 119.831625 125.253125 and they're tested for uh their pollution control equipment
sw3574B-ms98-a-0019 125.253125 135.610125 and if they don't qualify then they have to take it to a mechanic and have it gone over and then verify that it's it is drivable
sw3574B-ms98-a-0020 135.610125 147.650375 so they've they've tried to do a lot of that and i you know uh there seem to be [noise] a[t]- at least in certain little pockets and we were talking earlier about Madison
sw3574B-ms98-a-0021 147.650375 159.057375 Madison has one of the nicest uh bike uh road uh sharing programs of of any city in Wisconsin
sw3574B-ms98-a-0022 159.057375 170.699750 in all of Wisconsin has probably the most extensive number of uh bike trails for recreational use of any of the states
sw3574B-ms98-a-0023 170.699750 174.848250 and there is a a real promotion of of biking
sw3574B-ms98-a-0024 174.848250 184.353625 but um there are still a lot of people who'll insist on on driving their own automobiles uh to go everywhere
sw3574B-ms98-a-0025 184.353625 189.578500 i find that a little irritating because i don't think it's always so necessary
sw3574B-ms98-a-0026 189.578500 218.271625 [silence]
sw3574B-ms98-a-0027 218.271625 227.117625 [vocalized-noise] send send them to Wisconsin and we'll let them_1 try to drink out of some of the lakes and try to fish in some of the lakes that have been suffering from
sw3574B-ms98-a-0028 227.117625 240.487625 uh the uh acid rain and [laughter-they'll] they'll they may wake up you know how would you like to own a piece of property where your lake is going sour because of the acid rain
sw3574B-ms98-a-0029 240.487625 248.163875 it's a really a serious issue for those of us up in this ah sector up up here
sw3574B-ms98-a-0030 248.163875 257.134375 [silence]
sw3574B-ms98-a-0031 257.134375 267.819250 i think it's mostly vehicles although [noise] it does come from some of the industry of of the Gary area
sw3574B-ms98-a-0032 267.819250 279.025500 and uh i don't know exactly where it emerges from when it it's up in the ah northern sectors of Wisconsin that causes the acid rain
sw3574B-ms98-a-0033 279.025500 284.568125 that i'm a little uncertain of but i do know that uh it is a problem
sw3574B-ms98-a-0034 284.568125 298.562000 [silence]
