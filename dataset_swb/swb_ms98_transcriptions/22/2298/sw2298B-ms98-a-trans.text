sw2298B-ms98-a-0022 115.825375 127.242500 i feel pretty strongly about this and that's i think they're over reacting as far as the the uh actions taken against their the little guy the depositor the customers
sw2298B-ms98-a-0023 127.242500 132.306500 i think they uh they went way to far the other way in the spectrum
sw2298B-ms98-a-0024 132.306500 135.393875 and on the other hand i don't

sw2298B-ms98-a-0041 195.947125 206.957500 yeah well i guess the hope is that uh they can find some way to muddle through and the economy recover enough to uh to help uh get them_1 out of it

sw2298B-ms98-a-0047 231.209125 233.153875 they got a little uh
sw2298B-ms98-a-0048 233.153875 241.652625 a little hesitation in the recovery here and uh hopefully they'll rebound from that in a fairly short period of time

sw2298B-ms98-a-0056 270.106750 274.086000 it seems to me like they really haven't uh at least they haven't
sw2298B-ms98-a-0057 274.086000 283.352875 if they're doing anything it's still pretty much uh uh not out in the open it's uh you know behind the scenes kind of uh
sw2298B-ms98-a-0058 283.352875 287.330125 panels or whatever you know committees or investigations
sw2298B-ms98-a-0059 287.330125 289.770375 nothing uh
sw2298B-ms98-a-0060 289.770375 294.124250 nothing that makes headlines that much has been done really i don't think

sw2298B-ms98-a-0071 335.180750 338.762750 its capacity was short that day or something
