sw2298A-ms98-a-0010 33.504875 44.206250 no argument here yeah i- i think that uh now i'm i'm no financial expert but from what i've read and heard
sw2298A-ms98-a-0011 44.206250 54.526000 yeah i think there were some regulations on loans that were lifted that allowed savings and loans to make
sw2298A-ms98-a-0012 54.526000 56.817375 uh riskier
sw2298A-ms98-a-0013 56.817375 71.795000 uh investments and of course uh oil was uh one of the main things that were invested in oil and real estate and of course when oi[l]- when oil went south real estate went with it people were speculating in the future that
sw2298A-ms98-a-0014 71.795000 79.552750 without anything to fall back on when prices on both of those went went uh down
sw2298A-ms98-a-0015 79.552750 85.746750 [silence]
sw2298A-ms98-a-0016 85.746750 95.350625 well also in in[vestments]- investments in oil ventures as well because it was predic[ted]- predicated on uh a certain price per barrel
sw2298A-ms98-a-0017 95.350625 102.066625 to recover the costs of the loan and when oil went from thirty dollars a barrel to
sw2298A-ms98-a-0018 102.066625 105.977750 twelve dollars a barrel then that just wasn't any way to break even
sw2298A-ms98-a-0019 105.977750 107.728125 [silence]
sw2298A-ms98-a-0020 107.728125 109.027250 yeah

sw2298A-ms98-a-0031 172.791000 179.596875 of course it just adds to the to the annual deficit which adds to the overall debt of the nation
sw2298A-ms98-a-0032 179.596875 182.925125 and uh at some point in time
sw2298A-ms98-a-0033 182.925125 186.483750 it's either going to be repaid or just completely blown off
sw2298A-ms98-a-0034 186.483750 195.402000 i'm not sure which which one is which i- i really think our whole financial institution is a house of cards waiting to collapse
