sw2276A-ms98-a-0016 68.552500 79.500750 and uh but occasionally you know you'd stay in tune just long enough to get the latest different tidbit or a different angle and uh you really became addicted to it for a while
sw2276A-ms98-a-0017 79.500750 80.901125 [silence]
sw2276A-ms98-a-0018 80.901125 94.337750 i try to um [noise] the newspaper comes uh in the morning and i leave for work at seven huh yeah yeah and uh i usually don't get a chance to sit down until after work
sw2276A-ms98-a-0019 94.337750 101.699750 and at that point i tr[y]- at least try to get through most most the front section and maybe you know one or two other sections
sw2276A-ms98-a-0020 101.699750 109.404250 [silence]
sw2276A-ms98-a-0021 109.404250 110.677625 uh-huh
sw2276A-ms98-a-0022 110.677625 112.692375 [silence]
sw2276A-ms98-a-0023 112.692375 116.405750 [noise] where do what what newspaper do you get uh there
sw2276A-ms98-a-0024 116.405750 121.023000 how does it how does compare have you can you com[pare]- like how does it compare to the Post
sw2276A-ms98-a-0025 121.023000 122.984500 [silence]
sw2276A-ms98-a-0026 122.984500 137.188250 yeah that's funny because every once in a while if my husband and i have traveled or something um and we pick up a local paper we're really shocked even in a major city at how local it is it's really provincial
sw2276A-ms98-a-0027 137.188250 139.070625 [silence]
sw2276A-ms98-a-0028 139.070625 141.374750 is it really i mean
sw2276A-ms98-a-0029 141.374750 144.103500 [silence]
sw2276A-ms98-a-0030 144.103500 148.892000 that's m[aybe]- that's maybe because we get so you know we're so jaded with the Post uh
sw2276A-ms98-a-0031 148.892000 161.920125 which is really international and and it keeps reminding me you know that this w[e're]- we're really in an in an iso[lated]- different situation here and i keep saying no wonder the rest of the people in the world vote for in the country vote the [laughter-way] [laughter-they] [laughter-do] i [laughter-mean]
sw2276A-ms98-a-0032 161.920125 171.056875 but uh i probably do watch more T V because i get home and in between say cooking dinner or something if i can catch a five or six o'clock news
sw2276A-ms98-a-0033 171.056875 180.566375 i watch that usually uh before we settle down uh depending what time we get to bed we'll usually watch the ten or the eleven o'clock news we have a ten o'clock news here at night and that's ideal
sw2276A-ms98-a-0034 180.566375 183.748750 be[cause]- because by ten thirty i start to fade
sw2276A-ms98-a-0035 183.748750 185.457375 so uh
sw2276A-ms98-a-0036 185.457375 187.925000 [silence]

sw2276A-ms98-a-0041 195.084375 198.862500 [silence]
sw2276A-ms98-a-0042 198.862500 209.023750 yeah yeah no i can remember way back back in those days when i was in school the i think the only time we only really watched the news and this tells you how old i was was during the Cuban missile crisis
sw2276A-ms98-a-0043 209.023750 214.708125 uh i we could just we were all centered around that television yep
sw2276A-ms98-a-0044 214.708125 216.061250 [silence]
sw2276A-ms98-a-0045 216.061250 218.355250 that's exactly right and i'd
sw2276A-ms98-a-0046 218.355250 224.445875 yeah although i do worry that how easy this one was might be a bad lesson
sw2276A-ms98-a-0047 224.445875 229.988750 uh to the to the younger people um you know than there is the other generation
sw2276A-ms98-a-0048 229.988750 233.079750 [silence]

sw2276A-ms98-a-0051 237.005000 242.627250 that was probably the best part of the news was the uh some of the person human interest stories
sw2276A-ms98-a-0052 242.627250 245.924000 [silence]
sw2276A-ms98-a-0053 245.924000 247.578000 uh-huh
sw2276A-ms98-a-0054 247.578000 250.186375 yeah yeah
