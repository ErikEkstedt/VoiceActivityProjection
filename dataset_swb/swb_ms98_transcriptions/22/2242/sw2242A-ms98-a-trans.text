sw2242A-ms98-a-0016 73.834625 81.284500 of course camping again is i[s]- is like you say that that your your backpacking is i guess what i would call true camping i'm not
sw2242A-ms98-a-0017 81.284500 86.492625 i'm not sure that the other c[amping]- type of camping is nothing more than a leisure or
sw2242A-ms98-a-0018 86.492625 89.261000 [silence]

sw2242A-ms98-a-0032 145.060875 155.470125 i spent about ten years in Abilene for TI i i worked out there in Abilene in west Texas and i never did get a chance to get over to Lake Texoma i i wished i had uh
sw2242A-ms98-a-0033 155.470125 160.911000 [silence]

sw2242A-ms98-a-0037 186.978875 191.727125 [silence]
sw2242A-ms98-a-0038 191.727125 198.258750 yeah yeah you can that's about the price of them_1 up here they're they're uh uh Sears sells them_1 Coleman sells them_1
sw2242A-ms98-a-0039 198.258750 212.412500 they have some some good buys on them_1 and those are pretty nice i they're they're have a little galley a little uh sink that's got some compressed air and water in it and uh and a little stove that's like a propane stove
sw2242A-ms98-a-0040 212.412500 220.701250 couple of little cabinets and and uh sleeping [vocalized-noise] on either end of the the canvas when you open it up it's just all screened in so it's pretty neat uh
sw2242A-ms98-a-0041 220.701250 227.494750 the nice thing about dragging that is that it's very very convenient to travel on the highway with because it's very low
sw2242A-ms98-a-0042 227.494750 230.951500 mine is like pulling a big house behind [laughter-you] [laughter-you] [laughter-know]
sw2242A-ms98-a-0043 230.951500 239.247750 [noise] yeah an eighteen foot Terry uh it's completely self-contained i mean i have everything a shower a TV [laughter-everything] [laughter-in] [laughter-it] you know but
sw2242A-ms98-a-0044 239.247750 242.322750 yeah T E R R Y Terry
sw2242A-ms98-a-0045 242.322750 244.601000 well they're i guess
sw2242A-ms98-a-0046 244.601000 255.043000 they're pretty popular up this way yeah it's a pretty rugged trailer it's a tandem wheel even though it's only eighteen foot long so there's it drags pretty good you know with a car but
sw2242A-ms98-a-0047 255.043000 258.003875 i've got a big Oldsmobile that i pull it with when [laughter-i]
sw2242A-ms98-a-0048 258.003875 265.623500 uh if i get rid of that i'll have to get rid of the trailer because_1 i don't i'm not sure what else will be able to lug it around the hills up [laughter-here]
sw2242A-ms98-a-0049 265.623500 268.200250 kind of hilly country up through this way but
sw2242A-ms98-a-0050 268.200250 269.935750 um
sw2242A-ms98-a-0051 269.935750 280.677250 well uh i i like camping i i did a lot of it i when my kids were small of course they're all grown now and gone i've got four boys and they've kind of all gone and
sw2242A-ms98-a-0052 280.677250 291.714375 we don't really do that together much anymore as they've out two are out in California and two are still in Texas so we kind of don't get together but maybe once a year and then we just do a little fishing but
sw2242A-ms98-a-0053 291.714375 299.355500 i wished i had the opportunity to do camping because_1 i used to love to live at the lake all summer and into the fall and
sw2242A-ms98-a-0054 299.355500 305.219500 uh it was kind of pretty nice but uh i just wish that i had an opportunity to do a little more
sw2242A-ms98-a-0055 305.219500 317.434625 the thing that i i then again i i tried pulling the trailer one year and i went everywhere with the trailer like to beaches and to stuff but that got to be a hassle you know breaking down and setting up and breaking down so i decided that
sw2242A-ms98-a-0056 317.434625 326.737750 i would lease a s[pot]- a spot on this particular lake here in northern New England and go there every every spring and stay there all summer and it really worked out good for me
sw2242A-ms98-a-0057 326.737750 327.761750 [silence]
sw2242A-ms98-a-0058 327.761750 329.403000 oh yeah yeah
sw2242A-ms98-a-0059 329.403000 330.186000 [silence]
sw2242A-ms98-a-0060 330.186000 331.562750 yeah
sw2242A-ms98-a-0061 331.562750 333.972250 no i drive from the campground
sw2242A-ms98-a-0062 333.972250 339.843875 which uh it adds maybe twenty miles uh you know uh each way but it's not all that much uh
sw2242A-ms98-a-0063 339.843875 348.135750 twenty mi[les]- is goi[ng]- is just going a little different way it's probably twenty miles longer than my normal way to work i live in Rhode Island work in Massachusetts but
sw2242A-ms98-a-0064 348.135750 359.282125 it's uh it just adds about twenty miles to it but it's worth it to get to the campground and be just be out in the country and the woods all by yourself or you know with just a few neighbors around or so
sw2242A-ms98-a-0065 359.282125 362.293625 and that's that's pretty nice because_1 you can fish and just
sw2242A-ms98-a-0066 362.293625 364.026250 [silence]
sw2242A-ms98-a-0067 364.026250 367.156125 yeah well [laughter] like i say it just uh
sw2242A-ms98-a-0068 367.156125 373.790500 i i enjoy doing it i wished i had more time to do it but hopefully i can get up a retirement here before too much longer and then
sw2242A-ms98-a-0069 373.790500 379.069125 i'll be looking forward to to like i say with a Winnebago because as the older you get the less things you want to do
sw2242A-ms98-a-0070 379.069125 391.249250 i don't want to let the i don't want to let the canopy down i don't want to jack it up [laughter-i] [laughter-don't] [laughter-want] [laughter-to] do all that stuff [laughter-anymore] [vocalized-noise] and just turn the key off and get in the back and do whatever [laughter-you] [laughter-know]
