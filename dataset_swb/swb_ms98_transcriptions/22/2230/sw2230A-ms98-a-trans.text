sw2230A-ms98-a-0002 2.316500 4.767000 why do i think so few people vote i
sw2230A-ms98-a-0003 4.767000 10.204125 i think a lot of it is uh apathy um um
sw2230A-ms98-a-0004 10.204125 16.734375 for example uh when things are going good i think the voter turnout is less just because people
sw2230A-ms98-a-0005 16.734375 21.769750 figure why bother you know what's the difference especially when two candidates seem roughly equal
sw2230A-ms98-a-0006 21.769750 31.989750 um and in others cases you know they they see themselves as one voter in a million and they think what difference is it going to make whether i vote or not they they feel like one vote doesn't have an impact
sw2230A-ms98-a-0007 31.989750 33.163625 [silence]
sw2230A-ms98-a-0008 33.163625 36.022250 and i think a lot of cases like a lot of our
sw2230A-ms98-a-0009 36.022250 42.191125 minority issues the we had the ten four one verses the fourteen one election here in Dallas a while back
sw2230A-ms98-a-0010 42.191125 47.569875 and it lost well that was decided by a very small margin
sw2230A-ms98-a-0011 47.569875 52.832875 um and there were a lot of of minorities that wanted it to go
sw2230A-ms98-a-0012 52.832875 54.777000 the way that it didn't go
sw2230A-ms98-a-0013 54.777000 59.279375 but they also had very low voter turnouts especially_1 like in the Hispanic community
sw2230A-ms98-a-0014 59.279375 63.878875 and i think in that case they've just they developed a distrust of the system
sw2230A-ms98-a-0015 63.878875 67.208750 and so they've chosen not to participate in it
sw2230A-ms98-a-0016 67.208750 69.570250 and i think that's part of it
sw2230A-ms98-a-0017 69.570250 70.652125 [silence]
sw2230A-ms98-a-0018 70.652125 72.018000 what do you think

sw2230A-ms98-a-0022 85.021375 90.464125 i've i've heard people say that i know it's it's a real thing and i think it makes a difference
sw2230A-ms98-a-0023 90.464125 99.703250 as to how many people vote apparently not being a citizen not not serving on jury duty is important enough to them_1 that they don't want to have any say
sw2230A-ms98-a-0024 99.703250 102.935375 in uh politics

sw2230A-ms98-a-0030 119.248500 120.339875 yeah
sw2230A-ms98-a-0031 120.339875 121.992375 well
sw2230A-ms98-a-0032 121.992375 128.015875 last November was my first election in Dallas i've only lived in Dallas a little over a year
sw2230A-ms98-a-0033 128.015875 132.839750 and i went down this long list of judges that i was voting for
sw2230A-ms98-a-0034 132.839750 134.448625 and
sw2230A-ms98-a-0035 134.448625 144.296750 i mean i didn't know anything about any of these races i didn't know what the responsibilities of the judges were i didn't know anything about the individuals who's names were on the ballet
sw2230A-ms98-a-0036 144.296750 148.336250 and i'm going you know how can i possibly make an informed choice here
sw2230A-ms98-a-0037 148.336250 155.279375 so what's the point in voting for these people i- i mean it you know i get just as good of results as if i through darts at a board
sw2230A-ms98-a-0038 155.279375 188.098000 [silence]

sw2230A-ms98-a-0041 200.243625 211.342250 yeah you you think then that uh part of it is because the uh it flashes too much on the personal uh characteristics of the candidate rather than his uh
sw2230A-ms98-a-0042 211.342250 213.833250 job performance issues
sw2230A-ms98-a-0043 213.833250 227.017875 [silence]

sw2230A-ms98-a-0048 246.894250 248.691000 i'd i'd say
sw2230A-ms98-a-0049 248.691000 255.005625 yeah i'd say there's a large number especially of urban young voters that don't know what the Railroad Commission does
sw2230A-ms98-a-0050 255.005625 258.767000 and so they go you know w[ho]- who who what does it matter who i vote for
sw2230A-ms98-a-0051 258.767000 266.409625 i think well that's one thing i've noticed i've i've lived a couple of different places i've noticed Texas seems to have more elective offices than any place i've ever been
sw2230A-ms98-a-0052 266.409625 268.250500 [silence]
sw2230A-ms98-a-0053 268.250500 277.548750 well a lot more confusion you know i i[n]- in other towns i've never been called upon to decide all this long list of judges i've never been called upon to decide 
sw2230A-ms98-a-0054 277.548750 286.361000 you know [vocalized-noise] we're we're voting for Railroad commissioner and and uh Land commissioner and that sort of thing and in other state these would be appointments of the governor
sw2230A-ms98-a-0055 286.361000 289.359875 we wouldn't be expected to cast a ballet on the subject
sw2230A-ms98-a-0056 289.359875 292.776625 [silence]
sw2230A-ms98-a-0057 292.776625 294.572125 well it does

sw2230A-ms98-a-0059 296.007125 297.194625 um-hum

sw2230A-ms98-a-0061 298.280375 303.644250 but it also means you've got a unified state government you don't have different departments pulling against each other
sw2230A-ms98-a-0062 303.644250 308.485250 [silence]

sw2230A-ms98-a-0068 315.624625 319.585250 th[e]- th[e]- the big problem i guess with the mass media is you know 
sw2230A-ms98-a-0069 319.585250 326.032000 uh you don't have time to educate the public on these matters because the public is not going to sit still and [vocalized-noise] soak the message in
sw2230A-ms98-a-0070 326.032000 330.269000 i mean anything that can't be covered in thirty seconds or less they're not going to care about it
sw2230A-ms98-a-0071 330.269000 337.304125 or or if you can't dramatize it and put it on Unsolved Mysteries then they're not going to you know they're not going to want to hear it
sw2230A-ms98-a-0072 337.304125 343.530125 [silence]
sw2230A-ms98-a-0073 343.530125 348.612250 uh the the line what i waited maybe ten minutes in line
sw2230A-ms98-a-0074 348.612250 352.925750 it w[as]- it was uh a minor inconvenience it was certainly
sw2230A-ms98-a-0075 352.925750 355.942875 worth it to me i think
sw2230A-ms98-a-0076 355.942875 359.849125 i went right after work so that was when the line is the longest
sw2230A-ms98-a-0077 359.849125 367.096125 [silence]
sw2230A-ms98-a-0078 367.096125 368.505000 uh-huh

sw2230A-ms98-a-0088 414.660500 416.793375 so you have to go a little out of your way huh

sw2230A-ms98-a-0090 417.847875 419.187625 yeah

sw2230A-ms98-a-0098 435.274375 437.780125 yeah i would also like better
sw2230A-ms98-a-0099 437.780125 440.372125 information on
sw2230A-ms98-a-0100 440.372125 449.113000 on what on you know what am i voting on and and who some just general statements about the candidates i guess this is the kind of thing you expect from the newspapers 
sw2230A-ms98-a-0101 449.113000 452.175875 and i didn't see much of it
sw2230A-ms98-a-0102 452.175875 459.613750 like you know i s[ee]- you saw a lot about the major races but a lot of the minor ones that you're being called upon to decide there's very little information on
sw2230A-ms98-a-0103 459.613750 467.841375 as far as you know what what is the duties of this political office and uh and what are the characteristics or wh[at]- what are the
sw2230A-ms98-a-0104 467.841375 470.202000 issued statements and
sw2230A-ms98-a-0105 470.202000 474.139500 uh spoken goals of the uh candidates
sw2230A-ms98-a-0106 474.139500 475.944875 i'd like to get
sw2230A-ms98-a-0107 475.944875 488.712000 [silence]

sw2230A-ms98-a-0112 517.123250 527.726875 yeah well they the Dallas Morning News did publish a a section that covered the major races and it explained a lot to me about the individual candidates and helped me make a lot of
sw2230A-ms98-a-0113 527.726875 529.567625 better informed decisions
sw2230A-ms98-a-0114 529.567625 531.351500 but still uh
sw2230A-ms98-a-0115 531.351500 532.435500 [silence]
sw2230A-ms98-a-0116 532.435500 538.161750 you know it it left a lot of the the the local races the races unique to my precinct
sw2230A-ms98-a-0117 538.161750 548.161250 uh up in the air there is one thing that that did annoy me and that is the the my congressman last fall didn't have anybody running against him so basically i had no choice
sw2230A-ms98-a-0118 548.161250 550.231375 and i think uh
sw2230A-ms98-a-0119 550.231375 555.891375 in some districts you know there's a a party one party or another that has such a lock on it
sw2230A-ms98-a-0120 555.891375 559.538375 that uh you know why vote when it's decided already
sw2230A-ms98-a-0121 559.538375 561.777000 that sort of attitude
sw2230A-ms98-a-0122 561.777000 566.942625 [silence]
