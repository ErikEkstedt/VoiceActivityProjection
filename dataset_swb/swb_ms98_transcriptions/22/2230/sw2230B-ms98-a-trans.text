sw2230B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 2.470000 why do you think so few people vote then
sw2230B-ms98-a-0002 2.470000 31.320125 [silence]
sw2230B-ms98-a-0003 31.320125 32.742250 um-hum
sw2230B-ms98-a-0004 32.742250 66.486625 [silence]
sw2230B-ms98-a-0005 66.486625 67.938625 um-hum
sw2230B-ms98-a-0006 67.938625 70.335375 [silence]
sw2230B-ms98-a-0007 70.335375 77.613500 what part what part would you say the big brother aspect plays the people that don't want to be called for
sw2230B-ms98-a-0008 77.613500 85.489250 jury duty or or things that they've heard that says you know well they use this registration for this purpose or that so they just don't bother
sw2230B-ms98-a-0009 85.489250 102.296750 [silence]
sw2230B-ms98-a-0010 102.296750 103.666875 hum
sw2230B-ms98-a-0011 103.666875 115.190250 okay_1 and then what about the smaller election say some of the city elections uh even down to the uh school board type uh elections i guess there are so many
sw2230B-ms98-a-0012 115.190250 120.948875 that you can uh weed out the ones that you really want to partake in
sw2230B-ms98-a-0013 120.948875 147.399625 [silence]
sw2230B-ms98-a-0014 147.399625 148.788500 um-hum
sw2230B-ms98-a-0015 148.788500 154.860875 [silence]
sw2230B-ms98-a-0016 154.860875 156.732500 [laughter] right
sw2230B-ms98-a-0017 156.732500 164.292125 well it's a shame that uh that even the politician who wants to give give out good information about himself
sw2230B-ms98-a-0018 164.292125 173.479750 uh has trouble in virtually everything he does say that's positive or or even mediocre gets attacked from the other side
sw2230B-ms98-a-0019 173.479750 179.726625 such that he spends more of his time defending than he can putting forth any decent information
sw2230B-ms98-a-0020 179.726625 188.431250 uh and then once you get off the candidate's personal information then you want to get into an actual issue and then how the candidate feels about that
sw2230B-ms98-a-0021 188.431250 201.441375 there's there's very little room for or very little time to handle all the different things you'd like to know about a candidate and then unfortunately after you do get some of that information you may find out it weren't true to begin with [laughter] so
sw2230B-ms98-a-0022 201.441375 213.657125 [silence]
sw2230B-ms98-a-0023 213.657125 227.958000 i would say that it's much easier to deal with the the the public the uh media that's that's giving the information to the public is much easier to deal with uh any personality quirk or any negatives that they've found or any skeleton in the closet
sw2230B-ms98-a-0024 227.958000 232.787250 than to try and first educate the public to the point where they can
sw2230B-ms98-a-0025 232.787250 235.710875 listen to either side of a given issue
sw2230B-ms98-a-0026 235.710875 250.156750 uh and it's pretty difficult to deal with some of the issues lets say that T[exas]- uh Texas State uh Railroad Commission has to solve when you don't even fathom what the implications are of they're decision so who would you care who got in that position you know
sw2230B-ms98-a-0027 250.156750 254.207750 [silence]
sw2230B-ms98-a-0028 254.207750 255.754000 right
sw2230B-ms98-a-0029 255.754000 257.948250 [silence]
sw2230B-ms98-a-0030 257.948250 259.036875 right
sw2230B-ms98-a-0031 259.036875 266.262625 [silence]
sw2230B-ms98-a-0032 266.262625 270.318750 so hence more apathy [laughter] i guess or confusion
sw2230B-ms98-a-0033 270.318750 285.827250 [silence]
sw2230B-ms98-a-0034 285.827250 287.207250 um-hum
sw2230B-ms98-a-0035 287.207250 288.887875 [silence]
sw2230B-ms98-a-0036 288.887875 293.814375 hum boy that makes the governor's vote a whole lot more important doesn't it
sw2230B-ms98-a-0037 293.814375 298.436625 yeah a lot more appointee's i guess makes him carry a lot more weight
sw2230B-ms98-a-0038 298.436625 302.959000 [silence]
sw2230B-ms98-a-0039 302.959000 315.174875 that's probably well worth it then it probably be worth it just to do away with the cost of the elections and uh put it in the hands of maybe one man who can at least get his party together
sw2230B-ms98-a-0040 315.174875 316.870250 so hum
sw2230B-ms98-a-0041 316.870250 325.601875 [silence]
sw2230B-ms98-a-0042 325.601875 327.048625 um-hum
sw2230B-ms98-a-0043 327.048625 329.511250 [silence]
sw2230B-ms98-a-0044 329.511250 330.697000 right
sw2230B-ms98-a-0045 330.697000 336.996000 [silence]
sw2230B-ms98-a-0046 336.996000 343.794625 do you find it convenient to vote the actual time of day type where you have to go and the line you have to stand in
sw2230B-ms98-a-0047 343.794625 353.946875 [silence]
sw2230B-ms98-a-0048 353.946875 357.029875 did you go early in the morning or
sw2230B-ms98-a-0049 357.029875 358.667375 after work
sw2230B-ms98-a-0050 358.667375 359.717500 [silence]
sw2230B-ms98-a-0051 359.717500 361.706375 hum that's interesting
sw2230B-ms98-a-0052 361.706375 369.545375 well wh[ere]- in my little district fortunately it is literally across the street i could walk over there as it were we live across from the school and so we
sw2230B-ms98-a-0053 369.545375 380.413500 i drive out of my complex early in the morning and go over there usually before the polls even open and and vote right at the you know number one or two sometimes the third or fourth person in in line
sw2230B-ms98-a-0054 380.413500 391.813125 and i wait longer to to watch them_1 set up than i do actually in the in the line itself but that gets me out of there at a time that i can go down Central and not be bothered by the the traffic as it were
sw2230B-ms98-a-0055 391.813125 400.196875 because_1 normally i'm i'm at work before seven so uh just stay a little later that as it were and and make the the effort to vote
sw2230B-ms98-a-0056 400.196875 406.421875 uh but unfortunately since there are so many other things that uh our city wants to vote on
sw2230B-ms98-a-0057 406.421875 414.503375 they don't they they tend to make the elections if it's a not important election as it were they only open a few of the poles
sw2230B-ms98-a-0058 414.503375 423.659250 so i don't always i don't always vote at the same place so it's a little bit more trouble for me to well this election's going to be held this date and i've got to go over here
sw2230B-ms98-a-0059 423.659250 430.608000 and i've got to remember uh you know on this election i'm in this district in this election i'm for here and uh you know this precinct votes here
sw2230B-ms98-a-0060 430.608000 436.009625 and i would just assume in holding still and all vote in the same place as many times as they want
sw2230B-ms98-a-0061 436.009625 448.570125 [silence]
sw2230B-ms98-a-0062 448.570125 449.645500 um-hum
sw2230B-ms98-a-0063 449.645500 459.358250 [silence]
sw2230B-ms98-a-0064 459.358250 460.750875 um-hum
sw2230B-ms98-a-0065 460.750875 473.309000 [silence]
sw2230B-ms98-a-0066 473.309000 474.472000 right
sw2230B-ms98-a-0067 474.472000 487.125375 probably wouldn't even hurt to have a section that says here's how this particular office affected you or could have affected you over the last several years you know these are the kinds of decisions that this particular judge or this particular
sw2230B-ms98-a-0068 487.125375 489.977500 uh Railroad Commission for instance does
sw2230B-ms98-a-0069 489.977500 498.594750 if if you know if he he does do something [laughter-or] you pay attention to this or this is the guy to to blame for this if uh you didn't like what happened
sw2230B-ms98-a-0070 498.594750 503.996500 you are right there is no uh no such deal other than the small publication that uh
sw2230B-ms98-a-0071 503.996500 517.972125 uh League of Women Voters puts out it supplements that newspaper that i get a local newspaper they they published but uh nothing per se in the major newspaper and as hungry as they are for things to print you'd think they'd want to do that
sw2230B-ms98-a-0072 517.972125 547.479375 [silence]
sw2230B-ms98-a-0073 547.479375 548.833000 um-hum

sw2230B-ms98-a-0077 561.489375 562.704375 that's true
sw2230B-ms98-a-0078 562.704375 567.716625 with so many elected officials i guess there's just so many people to go around [laughter] in some of those cases
sw2230B-ms98-a-0079 567.716625 572.609125 hum well i hear someone calling me so i better let you go
sw2230B-ms98-a-0080 572.609125 575.755625 yeah at least [laughter] bye
