sw2254A-ms98-a-0035 156.650375 165.288375 but it was really good everything that was very garlicky and their big specials are things like um very fancy omelets or very fancy crepes
sw2254A-ms98-a-0036 165.288375 178.165125 and then they also have a lot of other uh French oriented uh meals and i normally get something that's crepe and very American and then she gets something French yeah but um yeah but

sw2254A-ms98-a-0071 307.007500 311.249500 yeah we're the same because i'm in graduate school and we're living off her salary
sw2254A-ms98-a-0072 311.249500 325.240000 and my and my part-time work you know it's not our the restaurant our favorite restaurant in the town of Salisbury where actually we live you know where my where i'll return to my job or whatever we can normally eat out for um under fourteen dollars
sw2254A-ms98-a-0073 325.240000 329.981375 and that's you know that's the two of us having un[limited]- unlimited French fries
sw2254A-ms98-a-0074 329.981375 341.490625 and uh it may be a Mexican pizza sometimes both together um along with and see it which is really funny too you know normally she goes straight for vegetables except when she's having French fries
sw2254A-ms98-a-0075 341.490625 347.197000 then i- i'll order like a vegetable soup or something you know but she'll just have the French fries you know
sw2254A-ms98-a-0076 347.197000 348.993750 [silence]
sw2254A-ms98-a-0077 348.993750 360.681625 no no in fact i[n]- we're very environmental so we very rarely eat at any of the fast-food restaurants uh just because of the um the styrofoam and the plastic waste
sw2254A-ms98-a-0078 360.681625 369.457125 and whatever we very rarely will eat at a uh a fast-food restaurant i will i'll eat at one more often because of graduate school and being on the road more
sw2254A-ms98-a-0079 369.457125 378.252500 but um yeah but she w[ill]- she almost refuses you know to do that in fact we're at a point now where if we do a salad bar at the grocery store
sw2254A-ms98-a-0080 378.252500 387.205000 we save the same plastic container and we yeah we take it with us back to the store and bring it home yeah and we take yeah
sw2254A-ms98-a-0081 387.205000 395.699375 [silence]
sw2254A-ms98-a-0082 395.699375 397.494625 um-hum
sw2254A-ms98-a-0083 397.494625 398.994375 yeah
sw2254A-ms98-a-0084 398.994375 400.814375 [silence]
sw2254A-ms98-a-0085 400.814375 401.992625 uh-huh
sw2254A-ms98-a-0086 401.992625 403.001750 [silence]
sw2254A-ms98-a-0087 403.001750 405.323000 well that's a really good idea
sw2254A-ms98-a-0088 405.323000 406.498625 yeah
sw2254A-ms98-a-0089 406.498625 408.820375 [silence]
sw2254A-ms98-a-0090 408.820375 415.218875 um-hum yeah we we've used the same uh you know tin bottom with plastic top
sw2254A-ms98-a-0091 415.218875 419.189000 probably for the past oh i don't know six months
sw2254A-ms98-a-0092 419.189000 431.467875 yeah so so we're very you know we try to be very environmental and and in fact it's terrible now because um i guess we've donated money to a number of organizations and you know we're in school i'm in school and we're
sw2254A-ms98-a-0093 431.467875 439.158000 barely surviving here and and we get calls now from like World Wildlife Federation like demanding a hundred dollars
sw2254A-ms98-a-0094 439.158000 449.494250 yeah and when you say but we're in c[ollege]- uh we're in graduate school we can't afford that you know they they say well how about twenty seven well how about ten you know yeah so
sw2254A-ms98-a-0095 449.494250 450.479875 [silence]
sw2254A-ms98-a-0096 450.479875 453.457875 uh-huh yeah we do all we can now
sw2254A-ms98-a-0097 453.457875 465.486750 but that it it you know i think that also goes along uh the reason why we pick the restaurants that we go to you know we we really -[ha]ve we really look at restaurants now there's one other little restaurant in town that we'll go to that is um 
sw2254A-ms98-a-0098 465.486750 472.271750 sandwiches and chips and a pickle you know but you still and that's five fifty
sw2254A-ms98-a-0099 472.271750 485.487750 but if you go to a fast-food restaurant you're going to spend four fifty and you're going to produce a lot of styrofoam and a lot of plastic so we you know we'll go there instead of you know just going to a fast-food place
sw2254A-ms98-a-0100 485.487750 488.228375 [silence]
