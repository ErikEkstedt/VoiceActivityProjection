sw2238B-ms98-a-0012 55.969625 61.480125 oh you don't what they're what they're working on is uh the way i understand it is the computer system
sw2238B-ms98-a-0013 61.480125 71.934250 that you know in the future and who knows how far in the future they they believe that computers will be able to understand human voice where instead of having to have a keyboard and press in what you want the computer to do
sw2238B-ms98-a-0014 71.934250 80.377375 you'll be able to tell it what you want it to do and that's why they're gathering the voices in order to do research to enable computers to be able to do that

sw2238B-ms98-a-0054 214.394375 226.760375 yeah oh definitely we kind of went through a situation with my father my father was a um dia[betic]- he was pronounced a diabetic when he was thirty and uh had diabetes for all you know many many years and
sw2238B-ms98-a-0055 226.760375 238.026000 you know didn't take quite as good care of himself in the beginning as he should have i mean he was put on insulin immediately but his diet he wasn't as careful with as he should have been in the beginning so he deteriorated rather quickly and
sw2238B-ms98-a-0056 238.026000 246.545500 by the time he was in his mid fifties which is very young he was he was nearly blind and was going into kidney failure and couldn't
sw2238B-ms98-a-0057 246.545500 259.504000 couldn't walk for very long periods of time the muscles in his neck and that type of thing had deteriorated to the point that he always had to have something to lean his head back against and and you know we were you know myself and my two sisters were
sw2238B-ms98-a-0058 259.504000 269.343375 you know in the situation of a a fifty seven year old father looking in to put him in a nursing home which was which was at fif[ty]- i'm know it it's scary isn't it yeah i mean it was 
sw2238B-ms98-a-0059 269.343375 281.226625 it was just a horrible situation for us to bo[th]- you know to be in and we just you know because of course like you say like your mother his mind was was perfect and wonderful it was he just could not get around to take care of himself
sw2238B-ms98-a-0060 281.226625 293.849250 and uh we ended up opting for um a live-in nurse and you know that came into his home and and we set her up a room in a spare room and she stayed there with him instead because we just could not imagine
sw2238B-ms98-a-0061 293.849250 299.569000 a fifty seven year old man in a nursing home we just you know we just could not could not imagine doing it
sw2238B-ms98-a-0062 299.569000 311.784625 and we knew that it wouldn't you know we couldn't even do the the live-in nurse thing forever you know and but he was just so against and and when you said your mother knew that this is probably where she needed to be it was such a different story because_1 he was
sw2238B-ms98-a-0063 311.784625 324.839750 so against going to a nursing home which at that age i can't blame him you know it would just it just scared him to death to be you know that young and who knows you know the thought of being there another twenty or thirty years you know just was was just
sw2238B-ms98-a-0064 324.839750 334.357875 too much for him you know so we you know we opted for that route so i kind of know what you mean about the the trauma of you know the thought of doing it you know it was just
sw2238B-ms98-a-0065 334.357875 342.662000 it was just very hard but i guess you know there's there's there's good ones and there's bad ones i think you just have to be so very careful you know and
sw2238B-ms98-a-0066 342.662000 352.230125 you know you're lucky if you do have a situation where the mind is is still good and they can tell you if they're being well taken care of i think otherwise you you end up with serious problems
sw2238B-ms98-a-0067 352.230125 357.563750 you know
sw2238B-ms98-a-0068 357.563750 358.654750 uh-huh

sw2238B-ms98-a-0077 377.401625 388.427750 that was another situation because my this was my father lived in Missouri and was in a little small town of about three thousand and uh we just got very very lucky and found a woman
sw2238B-ms98-a-0078 388.427750 401.840500 who was willing to do this and you know someone that we had known from you know had lived in [vocalized-noise] to[wn]- you know that same town forever and we knew very well and we knew her history and we knew that she wasn't going to steal from him we knew that she would take good care of him and 
sw2238B-ms98-a-0079 401.840500 408.489875 and we just got extremely lucky to find someone who was willing to do it and she stayed five days a week and spent the night
sw2238B-ms98-a-0080 408.489875 419.300875 but did go home on weekends and then we found another girl who had been kind of coming in and helping Dad clean and do that kind of thing for several years who said that she was willing to stay on the weekends and help him
sw2238B-ms98-a-0081 419.300875 427.864875 so we just got ex[tremely]- we were like you only the other end we got extremely lucky all the way around that we were able to find somebody [noise] that would stay with him at home
sw2238B-ms98-a-0082 427.864875 429.510500 [silence]
sw2238B-ms98-a-0083 429.510500 439.257625 well uh we only ma[de]- we only did that for um i guess that went on for about all not quite six months he passed away after six months there at home which
sw2238B-ms98-a-0084 439.257625 449.940000 we were very thankful that we were able to keep him at home and that you know he did pass away at home and uh rather than being in a nursing home i know he was much happier spending that six months at home
sw2238B-ms98-a-0085 449.940000 451.955750 you know definitely so
sw2238B-ms98-a-0086 451.955750 453.647625 [silence]
sw2238B-ms98-a-0087 453.647625 459.480375 uh they were they had been divorced many years earlier yeah so he was he was alone and really had you know and
sw2238B-ms98-a-0088 459.480375 472.037375 and uh my uh youngest sister was um about an hour and a half away in college and uh i was you know down here six hundred miles away and then my the third sister was in Atlanta Georgia you know so we weren't really
sw2238B-ms98-a-0089 472.037375 484.401750 well we were even right there where we could take care of him you know so it was really a hard situation you know when in this society where everybody kind of gets spread out it's not as easy as it used to be to take care of aging parents you know it you know y[ou]-
sw2238B-ms98-a-0090 484.401750 489.976500 it's hard to move them_1 in with you or you move in with them or even you know drop in everyday you know you just
