sw2238A-ms98-a-0022 105.776250 118.596250 we're our town is five thousand so i was very concerned about what the trip the traffic would be like around Dallas Fort Worth and gosh we were through there before we even realized that we were in heavy traffic so you've got a good system

sw2238A-ms98-a-0029 132.693750 142.992000 uh my mother is seventy will be seventy nine years old this fall and has been a nursing home resident for nearly three years
sw2238A-ms98-a-0030 142.992000 147.271250 so uh i feel like i have uh
sw2238A-ms98-a-0031 147.271250 157.309375 my decision was not i did not make the decision to send her to a nursing home she made the decision that she could not any longer live in
sw2238A-ms98-a-0032 157.309375 165.966250 in her apartment by herself she had long since given up her home and gone into an apartment and of course that was her decision at the time too so
sw2238A-ms98-a-0033 165.966250 175.248375 and then in that we are in a small royal a rural community i think that makes such a difference too because
sw2238A-ms98-a-0034 175.248375 181.167125 well as a matter of fact my daughter is now the assistant director of nurses at that nursing home
sw2238A-ms98-a-0035 181.167125 184.741125 sh[e]- yes yes she wasn't at the time
sw2238A-ms98-a-0036 184.741125 192.523125 but she has since gone to that nursing home so i just feel that i did not have any of the trauma that people talk about

sw2238A-ms98-a-0038 193.745375 201.779000 well it just did a really marvelous thing and mother's mind is good it's her body that's bad and uh
sw2238A-ms98-a-0039 201.779000 215.201250 fo[r]- to have the responsibility of putting someone in a nursing home whose mind was not good and could not tell you if they were being mistreated or something it just would all be so different

sw2238A-ms98-a-0111 488.058750 500.037875 i just never considered the moving in with i could not ever have handled that my mother is incontinent and uh and i don't know i suppose that would have been my excuse uh
sw2238A-ms98-a-0112 500.037875 507.512625 but i don't think had that situation ex[isted]- not existed that i could have done that at all i'm not

sw2238A-ms98-a-0118 515.072875 528.632625 well i think my sister is an RN and lives in Knoxville Tennessee and i think that my mother had thought in the back of her mind that she perhaps might go to Jean's and it did take when she first went into the c[are]- care center
sw2238A-ms98-a-0119 528.632625 535.627875 she just completely gave up uh just could not even sit up in the wheelchair without being tied in
sw2238A-ms98-a-0120 535.627875 545.216625 and that went on for almost six months and uh finally my sister came to visit and mother was talking about getting better and getting out of the care center
sw2238A-ms98-a-0121 545.216625 553.423250 and my sister is very blunt and she said mother this is going to be your home you might as well get used to it which i could not say to her
sw2238A-ms98-a-0122 553.423250 566.962625 and from that point on i think within the next six months she came to accept that as fact and then she began improving and is walking better now than she probably did in three years but
sw2238A-ms98-a-0123 566.962625 572.566250 still for the most part she is wheelchair bound or bed bound and um
sw2238A-ms98-a-0124 572.566250 582.888375 i don't know i guess maybe i have accepted that the nursing home is her home because i've started to decorate her room more than i ever did in the beginning so
sw2238A-ms98-a-0125 582.888375 591.116250 uh even though everyone knows that's the way it has to be you still it takes a little bit to accept
sw2238A-ms98-a-0126 591.116250 596.886625 no no and certainly it's very expensive there's no question about that
sw2238A-ms98-a-0127 596.886625 599.617250 but we had a severe ice
