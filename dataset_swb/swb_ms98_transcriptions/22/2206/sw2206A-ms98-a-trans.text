sw2206A-ms98-a-0019 76.741750 83.494000 no i've well Wisconsin gets pretty bad sometimes too but uh probably not near as bad as New York uh i'm sure
sw2206A-ms98-a-0020 83.494000 86.320000 i think it depends on what part of the state

sw2206A-ms98-a-0022 87.720750 92.010000 but this winter here i think we only had one instance of ice one weekend

sw2206A-ms98-a-0024 94.493625 106.016250 and uh other than that uh it was uh maybe just uh three real cold spells i don't have too much uh shrubbery damage from that but uh still some didn't manage to survive

sw2206A-ms98-a-0061 267.991375 274.754500 yeah i remember maybe uh maybe three winters where we had a white Christmas here
sw2206A-ms98-a-0062 274.754500 279.231875 other than that it's uh the snow usually doesn't last more than a day or two

sw2206A-ms98-a-0068 292.497250 301.682625 what's really bad here in winter is when we get uh ice on the roads and the temperature doesn't get above freezing there is no uh ice removal equipment
sw2206A-ms98-a-0069 301.682625 303.483500 [silence]

sw2206A-ms98-a-0089 373.998125 378.250375 so they usually get uh worse weather [vocalized-noise] than we do

sw2206A-ms98-a-0115 475.992250 477.490875 [silence]
sw2206A-ms98-a-0116 477.490875 478.973625 okay

sw2206A-ms98-a-0125 531.815250 534.499125 i can only guess that it's supposed to be nice
sw2206A-ms98-a-0126 534.499125 537.294250 [silence]

sw2206A-ms98-a-0134 558.988875 562.995375 anyway i guess everything's been pretty typical for March
sw2206A-ms98-a-0135 562.995375 566.980250 have to see what uh April or May have to offer
sw2206A-ms98-a-0136 566.980250 573.274625 [silence]
sw2206A-ms98-a-0137 573.274625 580.497500 sometimes it does uh sometimes it'll get in the eighties uh as early as uh January February

sw2206A-ms98-a-0141 593.307500 597.486375 well it leaves a mess then when it does melt [vocalized-noise] everything thaws out
sw2206A-ms98-a-0142 597.486375 598.997375 [silence]
sw2206A-ms98-a-0143 598.997375 599.934250 lot of mu[d]-
