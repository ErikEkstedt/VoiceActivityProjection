sw2228B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.580375 [noise]
sw2228B-ms98-a-0002 1.580375 3.230500 all right
sw2228B-ms98-a-0003 3.230500 7.415875 uh feelings on what caused the S and L
sw2228B-ms98-a-0004 7.415875 9.181750 crisis
sw2228B-ms98-a-0005 9.181750 12.185000 [noise] i guess i don't
sw2228B-ms98-a-0006 12.185000 20.697750 have a real technical knowledge for what happened i gather that there where large numbers of situations where
sw2228B-ms98-a-0007 20.697750 24.640250 loan were made that appear to be
sw2228B-ms98-a-0008 24.640250 32.930625 a good loan but in a speculative since and with have little regulation going on because of deregulation during
sw2228B-ms98-a-0009 32.930625 34.948750 the Reagan eight years
sw2228B-ms98-a-0010 34.948750 40.028000 uh more and more S and L simply began to take riskier and riskier loans
sw2228B-ms98-a-0011 40.028000 47.081125 and then when they began to collapse one after the other i think almost like an avalanche of of property values devalued
sw2228B-ms98-a-0012 47.081125 48.651875 [silence]
sw2228B-ms98-a-0013 48.651875 53.640375 right i- i don't have a a field for whether or not 
sw2228B-ms98-a-0014 53.640375 58.356125 this is the equivalent of what was called the teapot dome
sw2228B-ms98-a-0015 58.356125 62.424750 uh scandal are you familiar with that from your histories lessons or whatever
sw2228B-ms98-a-0016 62.424750 72.329125 uh i vaguely recall but i've never gone and and done any study on it since the S and L thing that teapot dome scandal is when i think during the Hoover years 
sw2228B-ms98-a-0017 72.329125 86.214625 where gobs of land was was sold at really inflated prices on the theory that there were natural gas beneath it and that that appeared to be corruption within the Hoover administration i don't have a real since
sw2228B-ms98-a-0018 86.214625 87.367250 [silence]
sw2228B-ms98-a-0019 87.367250 95.195625 of of like corruption that caused S and L all though i have a feeling that people look the other way when things began to go sour
sw2228B-ms98-a-0020 95.195625 96.636750 maybe
sw2228B-ms98-a-0021 96.636750 112.842500 [silence]
sw2228B-ms98-a-0022 112.842500 114.213750 uh-huh
sw2228B-ms98-a-0023 114.213750 122.218625 [silence]
sw2228B-ms98-a-0024 122.218625 123.780250 yeah
sw2228B-ms98-a-0025 123.780250 127.702250 it it seems like there were on awful a lot of people
sw2228B-ms98-a-0026 127.702250 130.630125 making loans and business decisions
sw2228B-ms98-a-0027 130.630125 132.096250 on a
sw2228B-ms98-a-0028 132.096250 134.890000 get rich quick is is the wrong phrase but
sw2228B-ms98-a-0029 134.890000 139.011000 if it captures some of the the feeling i have from the people making
sw2228B-ms98-a-0030 139.011000 144.529375 business decisions that if they failed it's sort of well no skin of my back i'll move on to this other company or
sw2228B-ms98-a-0031 144.529375 156.118750 i- i just since that they didn't have a commitment to the stability of the organizations they were were making the decisions for and i don't know whether that's because they had other opportunities to which they could move
sw2228B-ms98-a-0032 156.118750 164.081750 you know that it was that easy for them to find new work that they didn't weren't stuck to where they were and as the things begin to collapse they just moved on
sw2228B-ms98-a-0033 164.081750 165.059000 [silence]
sw2228B-ms98-a-0034 165.059000 171.903625 or whether they had extracted enough money in a percentage base such that they didn't they didn't care any more i
sw2228B-ms98-a-0035 171.903625 175.220125 i just i'm rather puzzled about the whole thing [laughter]
sw2228B-ms98-a-0036 175.220125 176.142250 it
sw2228B-ms98-a-0037 176.142250 183.552875 [silence]
sw2228B-ms98-a-0038 183.552875 185.051125 okay
sw2228B-ms98-a-0039 185.051125 206.288000 [silence]
sw2228B-ms98-a-0040 206.288000 209.266875 well they didn't they didn't have a since of risk
sw2228B-ms98-a-0041 209.266875 211.432875 oh okay
sw2228B-ms98-a-0042 211.432875 221.156875 [silence]
sw2228B-ms98-a-0043 221.156875 222.599750 uh-huh
sw2228B-ms98-a-0044 222.599750 226.377625 [silence]
sw2228B-ms98-a-0045 226.377625 227.768875 okay
sw2228B-ms98-a-0046 227.768875 237.631250 [silence]
sw2228B-ms98-a-0047 237.631250 242.427250 well do you think we there's a final accounting yet not in the since of pennies and
sw2228B-ms98-a-0048 242.427250 246.784875 nickels but do you think there's accounting on an ordered of magnitude or that
sw2228B-ms98-a-0049 246.784875 251.353750 that they really do understand how much money it is for awhile it seemed like every time i opened the paper up
sw2228B-ms98-a-0050 251.353750 257.768500 it was escalating in terms of the damage uh did is your sense that that we now understand how bad it is 
sw2228B-ms98-a-0051 257.768500 259.786250 or is there more to be heard yet
sw2228B-ms98-a-0052 259.786250 274.361000 [silence]
sw2228B-ms98-a-0053 274.361000 281.022000 so you don't think necessarily they don't have a complete grasp yet of the problem or whether it [vocalized-noise] 
sw2228B-ms98-a-0054 281.022000 289.124500 [silence]
sw2228B-ms98-a-0055 289.124500 290.462375 uh-huh
sw2228B-ms98-a-0056 290.462375 294.008500 [silence]
sw2228B-ms98-a-0057 294.008500 296.149875 to be caught in the land slide
sw2228B-ms98-a-0058 296.149875 298.417500 [silence]
sw2228B-ms98-a-0059 298.417500 302.288250 do you think to possibly is that it'll happen with the the regular banks 
sw2228B-ms98-a-0060 302.288250 310.224125 [silence]
sw2228B-ms98-a-0061 310.224125 314.103250 it seems that i recall reading for the last
sw2228B-ms98-a-0062 314.103250 321.551875 oh let's say starting three years ago but not so much in the last year of bank risks
sw2228B-ms98-a-0063 321.551875 327.697875 of relative to the loaning funds to third world countries like Mexico Venezuela
sw2228B-ms98-a-0064 327.697875 334.921750 uh and Argentina based on oil loans and then the price of oil had had gone south
sw2228B-ms98-a-0065 334.921750 341.269375 resulting in those loans being very risky and i guess i read articles of various banks that have done
sw2228B-ms98-a-0066 341.269375 346.437750 the right thing to contain their risks given that they had made multiple billion dollar loans
sw2228B-ms98-a-0067 346.437750 349.730125 i have this vague since that that could happen
sw2228B-ms98-a-0068 349.730125 355.326375 that that there are still monies loaned out to third world countries that could end up being totally lost
sw2228B-ms98-a-0069 355.326375 367.827125 [silence]
sw2228B-ms98-a-0070 367.827125 369.130875 um-hum
sw2228B-ms98-a-0071 369.130875 378.352750 [silence]
sw2228B-ms98-a-0072 378.352750 380.497750 and so you think that it's just gone
sw2228B-ms98-a-0073 380.497750 389.201000 [silence]
sw2228B-ms98-a-0074 389.201000 390.608375 okay
sw2228B-ms98-a-0075 390.608375 392.321375 [silence]
sw2228B-ms98-a-0076 392.321375 395.665750 do you think it is necessary to have the
sw2228B-ms98-a-0077 395.665750 398.857250 federal guaranty program
sw2228B-ms98-a-0078 398.857250 405.681500 like my since is that was there to try to protect small investors but it ended up protecting big investors
sw2228B-ms98-a-0079 405.681500 408.761500 which i don't think is what it was meant to do 
sw2228B-ms98-a-0080 408.761500 416.148750 so i guess it i feel like as long as we have the possibility for this large numbers of people to be protected
sw2228B-ms98-a-0081 416.148750 419.483875 the possibility exists for for these sorts of
sw2228B-ms98-a-0082 419.483875 421.065125 of problems
sw2228B-ms98-a-0083 421.065125 445.052750 [silence]
sw2228B-ms98-a-0084 445.052750 446.284000 um
sw2228B-ms98-a-0085 446.284000 448.971000 so your since is that the
sw2228B-ms98-a-0086 448.971000 451.453500 that uh the
sw2228B-ms98-a-0087 451.453500 458.636750 the loan guarantees which really were accounts guaranties so the so that the account holders that if something went wrong they would have their money
sw2228B-ms98-a-0088 458.636750 465.505000 and given that the S and L's have had disasters then those account holders are are their money is still being protected
sw2228B-ms98-a-0089 465.505000 472.684125 and that is it's million of people with anywhere from thousands to tens of thousands i guess of
sw2228B-ms98-a-0090 472.684125 475.681875 of dollars being protected
sw2228B-ms98-a-0091 475.681875 481.949000 it it seems like um [noise] there was a lot of money being protected in multiple accounts
sw2228B-ms98-a-0092 481.949000 484.159250 uh it's if if you take
sw2228B-ms98-a-0093 484.159250 495.248375 ten million people and protect ten thousand dollars it still only a hundred bi[llion]- billion dollars and we're taking about monies way in access of that now so it's obvious that we've protected large accounts
sw2228B-ms98-a-0094 495.248375 498.587000 and perhaps multiple people in multiple S and L's
sw2228B-ms98-a-0095 498.587000 503.058000 and and it seems like maybe that needs to be thought about rethought
sw2228B-ms98-a-0096 503.058000 504.886125 you know that the for
sw2228B-ms98-a-0097 504.886125 512.999875 i guess i'm content with the need to have protection on on accounts but i feel likes it's on an individual basis someone whose got
sw2228B-ms98-a-0098 512.999875 516.057375 accounts in thirty five different S and L's or
sw2228B-ms98-a-0099 516.057375 523.330500 thirty or forty thousand dollars and they're all protected by the government seems to me like they've gotten around what was [laughter] intended to be the issue there
sw2228B-ms98-a-0100 523.330500 525.059625 uh-huh
sw2228B-ms98-a-0101 525.059625 534.797375 i guess i don't have a personal sense of vulnerability on it since i was not a heavy user of any S and L's and and let alone any of them that went bankrupt
sw2228B-ms98-a-0102 534.797375 542.308625 and i guess that means that from my perspective it could happen again because that means means i'm not worried enough 
sw2228B-ms98-a-0103 542.308625 549.483000 uh it's kind of thing where maybe we'll survive and then i then it will happen again because we don't pay attention to those kinds of things
sw2228B-ms98-a-0104 549.483000 581.100625 [silence]
sw2228B-ms98-a-0105 581.100625 582.740375 uh-huh
sw2228B-ms98-a-0106 582.740375 586.931875 well perhaps if there are regulatory
sw2228B-ms98-a-0107 586.931875 588.737875 um
sw2228B-ms98-a-0108 588.737875 591.194250 constraints put back in place
sw2228B-ms98-a-0109 591.194250 597.350875 it will protect that maybe we have learned a little bit of a lesson here about what happens if you remove a little of the regulation
sw2228B-ms98-a-0110 597.350875 598.464000 uh [vocalized-noise]
