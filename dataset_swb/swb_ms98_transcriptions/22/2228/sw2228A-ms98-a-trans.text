sw2228A-ms98-a-0008 94.028625 99.465625 um-hum no i don't think it was really corruption that caused it
sw2228A-ms98-a-0009 99.465625 103.450250 or within i think people just started
sw2228A-ms98-a-0010 103.450250 108.259125 you know no[t]- not being as careful with the loans that they were making
sw2228A-ms98-a-0011 108.259125 110.167375 whenever
sw2228A-ms98-a-0012 110.167375 113.302625 y[ou]- you know whenever they gave them out
sw2228A-ms98-a-0013 113.302625 116.452000 i think maybe they didn't check into them enough
sw2228A-ms98-a-0014 116.452000 122.910875 or maybe because everyone else was doing it they figured they would just go ahead and approve it also so 
sw2228A-ms98-a-0015 122.910875 124.356750 yeah
sw2228A-ms98-a-0016 124.356750 143.268875 [silence]

sw2228A-ms98-a-0022 165.636750 173.622375 [silence]
sw2228A-ms98-a-0023 173.622375 184.089875 um-hum i know well [laughter] i'm um i know a little bit about it but i don't as much as i should know about it i'm a finance major here at Clarion
sw2228A-ms98-a-0024 184.089875 195.760000 and um i do know that one of the reasons that caused it is the fact that the federal reserved backed any loan that the Savings and L made with a a hundred thousand dollars
sw2228A-ms98-a-0025 195.760000 206.845625 so they were kind of insured with that hundred thousand dollars and i think that's kind of why they they were making the riskier loans because they were like oh well we have a hundred thousand dollars insurance on it
sw2228A-ms98-a-0026 206.845625 208.371125 [silence]
sw2228A-ms98-a-0027 208.371125 210.651375 no i don't think so
sw2228A-ms98-a-0028 210.651375 221.998250 and uh plus where the fact where they were allowed to make loans in any almost any type of loan and like some banks you know they're limited to the types of loans that they're allowed to make
sw2228A-ms98-a-0029 221.998250 226.785625 and i think the S and L's were more open with the types of loans that they were allowed to make
sw2228A-ms98-a-0030 226.785625 229.733625 and i think if they would be more bound
sw2228A-ms98-a-0031 229.733625 236.787000 to certain loans and not as high of insurance by the reserve then i don't think this would have happened

sw2228A-ms98-a-0036 261.596875 274.760625 [noise] i think that people just basically got tired of hearing it and it [laughter-wasn't] making it wasn't as good news as it was i think it's still a[dding]- you know adding up and i think it will be for awhile 
sw2228A-ms98-a-0037 274.760625 277.664375 [silence]
sw2228A-ms98-a-0038 277.664375 289.500000 no i don't i don't think they do i don't think how i don't think how they could find that big [vocalized-noise] you know how much was really lost or how much they were going to lose because there still are some S and L's still open 
sw2228A-ms98-a-0039 289.500000 293.929000 and it's and it's very possible for them to go down in the future because of this

sw2228A-ms98-a-0048 355.010875 368.499250 [noise] oh yeah um in some of my classes now i was just rea[ding]- i think it was in Venezuela i can't remember what company it was but they just wrote off like millions of dollars because they know they will never get it back
sw2228A-ms98-a-0049 368.499250 371.384375 you know and they just they just wrote it right off
sw2228A-ms98-a-0050 371.384375 378.491000 i think i think we've lost a lot of money and you know like we every never going to get it back it's impossible to get it back

sw2228A-ms98-a-0054 386.012500 389.894500 like even gave up on getting it back they're even trying any more
sw2228A-ms98-a-0055 389.894500 392.566375 they just totally wrote it off their book

sw2228A-ms98-a-0060 427.492500 432.807125 um it it's just it's just for you know safe purposes 
sw2228A-ms98-a-0061 432.807125 437.050875 you know in case something would happen um
sw2228A-ms98-a-0062 437.050875 444.478750 yeah [vocalized-noise] as long as there's enough little companies we're going to have to have something

sw2228A-ms98-a-0089 555.048500 564.157500 because i think like the bank people and any kind of people like that are gonna be worried about it and not to let it happen again in the near future
sw2228A-ms98-a-0090 564.157500 571.097125 but i think later on they're gonna start and forget about it and start making some of the riskier loans because i mean you're gonna have to take some risks 
sw2228A-ms98-a-0091 571.097125 582.249375 and as long as they're backed i think they're still gonna you know start taking on riskier loans and i think there is a chance of it [vocalized-noise] possibly happen again but not until you know late you know in the future
