sw2283A-ms98-a-0034 193.275375 199.506750 [silence]
sw2283A-ms98-a-0035 199.506750 203.506125 yeah i was beating on the phone going can you hear me so
sw2283A-ms98-a-0036 203.506125 208.511625 [silence]

sw2283A-ms98-a-0038 209.887500 223.540250 [silence]

sw2283A-ms98-a-0041 235.603500 238.702500 acorn squash are good winter keepers
sw2283A-ms98-a-0042 238.702500 251.608375 i mean things the way we grow are carrots and uh cabbage that sort of more less goes to waste you know we eat it we just too much she she starts her own plants she plants a lot of tomatoes
sw2283A-ms98-a-0043 251.608375 256.801000 i let her do a lot of the planting and putting and i- i do a lot of the uh
sw2283A-ms98-a-0044 256.801000 267.836125 a lot of the the ba[ck]- the back work and stuff but she does she helps me a lot too she puts a lot of financial she plans it all out
sw2283A-ms98-a-0045 267.836125 280.328875 beans like to be near certain types of plants now they they find that tomatoes don't do well if you put them next to something like uh peas i don't know something
sw2283A-ms98-a-0046 280.328875 281.844125 [silence]
sw2283A-ms98-a-0047 281.844125 290.554750 no it's just they don't like you to something like an onion and a tomato would go together but you're not supposed to put your onions near your beans i guess it's
sw2283A-ms98-a-0048 290.554750 295.409750 it it's just what scents it gives off they just don't like each other
sw2283A-ms98-a-0049 295.409750 303.623875 i mean [laughter] she she [vocalized-noise] reads all kinds of books so i wish i knew more to tell you why but
sw2283A-ms98-a-0050 303.623875 310.457500 [silence]
sw2283A-ms98-a-0051 310.457500 311.893500 they
sw2283A-ms98-a-0052 311.893500 313.230625 yeah [laughter]
sw2283A-ms98-a-0053 313.230625 324.929500 [silence]
sw2283A-ms98-a-0054 324.929500 326.871000 oh that's really weird
sw2283A-ms98-a-0055 326.871000 329.477250 [silence]
sw2283A-ms98-a-0056 329.477250 331.596500 i will put i've put my uh
sw2283A-ms98-a-0057 331.596500 334.736750 cucumbers are down at one end of the garden and like
sw2283A-ms98-a-0058 334.736750 339.538125 like i'll make an L shape i've put cantaloupe so they've been pretty close together
sw2283A-ms98-a-0059 339.538125 346.216625 but i don't think the vines have they don't really they don't have to be touching or anything like you say they cross pollinate just by bees
sw2283A-ms98-a-0060 346.216625 347.449500 [silence]
sw2283A-ms98-a-0061 347.449500 348.705375 oh
sw2283A-ms98-a-0062 348.705375 349.970250 i know
sw2283A-ms98-a-0063 349.970250 352.136000 [silence]
sw2283A-ms98-a-0064 352.136000 354.351375 some something weird
sw2283A-ms98-a-0065 354.351375 359.504000 this year we didn't this last season it was it was too wet up here
sw2283A-ms98-a-0066 359.504000 371.764625 we lost a lot of oh uh root things our oh uh our squash and our potatoes and we got half our yield [noise] was really bad because_1 of the water
sw2283A-ms98-a-0067 371.764625 391.266625 [silence]
sw2283A-ms98-a-0068 391.266625 392.895875 y[eah]- yeah
sw2283A-ms98-a-0069 392.895875 396.567250 [silence]
sw2283A-ms98-a-0070 396.567250 403.433375 yeah i- i have to do that i want to make some flowerbeds and i'm going to have a seven yard truck come in
sw2283A-ms98-a-0071 403.433375 405.260000 with some topsoil
sw2283A-ms98-a-0072 405.260000 416.069125 and i'm going to a my problem is i want to use those railroad ties to build up a planter but i don't know if the creosote in the railroad ties is going to do something
sw2283A-ms98-a-0073 416.069125 422.458625 to uh you know if i want to grow a tomato or something in there [laughter] i- i mean i guess it'd go for my flowers but
sw2283A-ms98-a-0074 422.458625 428.985250 [silence]
sw2283A-ms98-a-0075 428.985250 439.953000 yeah i don't i don't i just don't think you i always thought i'd put a tomato plant in there or something weird but i don't think i could really eat the fruit off it without wondering
sw2283A-ms98-a-0076 439.953000 443.986375 and i don't know if they make landscape ties that aren't treated
sw2283A-ms98-a-0077 443.986375 446.952125 [silence]
sw2283A-ms98-a-0078 446.952125 448.400000 yeah but they put some kind of
sw2283A-ms98-a-0079 448.400000 449.876000 chemicals in there too
sw2283A-ms98-a-0080 449.876000 451.019250 [silence]
sw2283A-ms98-a-0081 451.019250 460.347250 yeah well i'm not really worried about it it's mainly for flower bed so i'm not going to not go[ing]- i'm just not going to put that tomato plant in there
sw2283A-ms98-a-0082 460.347250 467.515125 but i yeah i do want to have a raised bed i've never i my flower gardens have always been like on the ground
sw2283A-ms98-a-0083 467.515125 468.916875 they don't [noise]
sw2283A-ms98-a-0084 468.916875 473.000000 it just looks so much better when it's up against the house tiered up
sw2283A-ms98-a-0085 473.000000 475.495000 [silence]
sw2283A-ms98-a-0086 475.495000 484.292375 yeah this house that i have is just a three bedroom ranch and i can tell you there's nothing around it cement foundation all the way round it not a shrub not a bush
sw2283A-ms98-a-0087 484.292375 487.628000 there was a lilac tree and the landlord cut it down and
sw2283A-ms98-a-0088 487.628000 497.876125 said yep that's one thing you have to do summer keep that lilac bush cut down so it doesn't rub up against the siding and i'm looking at him like jeez people would kill to have a lilac bush
sw2283A-ms98-a-0089 497.876125 507.500750 and he's cutting it down [laughter] so that's all right flower beds are all right anything as long as it doesn't rub up against the siding
sw2283A-ms98-a-0090 507.500750 514.496125 yep that's what he's worried about the trees or a bush because lilac bushes they they grow fast
sw2283A-ms98-a-0091 514.496125 523.578375 some people uh would really like to have them_1 and then the people that do have them_1 they spread and they sprout all over th[eir]- their lawn
sw2283A-ms98-a-0092 523.578375 529.720000 so they're kind of a pain but you know people who don't have them_1 think they're great and people who do have them_1
sw2283A-ms98-a-0093 529.720000 531.685500 cur[se]- curse
sw2283A-ms98-a-0094 531.685500 542.254500 another thing i have that um is weird is these a locus tree in the backyard as a matter of fact there's three of them very badly trimmed they aren't trimmed at all
sw2283A-ms98-a-0095 542.254500 546.803625 and i can imagine if i had to mow the lawn in the back which we said we'd do
sw2283A-ms98-a-0096 546.803625 553.825375 if if the trees hang down so low and the locus trees have like three quarters of an inch thorns [laughter-on] [laughter-it] so
sw2283A-ms98-a-0097 553.825375 556.012250 [silence]
sw2283A-ms98-a-0098 556.012250 566.940000 they're a pretty tree but you just when you walk up to them_1 they're covered with thorns so we're going to get a chain saw and we're going to limb limb it extensively so it the trees up overhead
sw2283A-ms98-a-0099 566.940000 568.268250 [silence]
sw2283A-ms98-a-0100 568.268250 575.992750 yeah [laughter] because i can just see brushing up against it that it would rip your skin it's worse than a r[ose]- a rose bush
sw2283A-ms98-a-0101 575.992750 578.455625 many times worse because_1 of course it's a tree
sw2283A-ms98-a-0102 578.455625 581.539500 [silence]
sw2283A-ms98-a-0103 581.539500 590.126750 yep my uh dad used to work on them_1 so i don't think i'll have a problem my husband will have problem borrowing [laughter-one]
sw2283A-ms98-a-0104 590.126750 592.841000 [laughter] even
sw2283A-ms98-a-0105 592.841000 595.650500 [silence]
sw2283A-ms98-a-0106 595.650500 598.656000 well if that's not the problem it
