sw2201B-ms98-a-0010 20.414250 23.818375 i just feel like it's an invas[ion]- invasion of my privacy
sw2201B-ms98-a-0011 23.818375 28.148750 you know i you know there's a lot alcohol for example
sw2201B-ms98-a-0012 28.148750 32.104750 i can go out and drink on the weekends and come in hung over and do a lot worse job
sw2201B-ms98-a-0013 32.104750 34.576625 than if i go out on Friday and
sw2201B-ms98-a-0014 34.576625 37.855625 i don't know say t[ake]- take a hit of Ecstasy and dance all night

sw2201B-ms98-a-0016 39.102125 42.321625 not saying that i do but i'm just
sw2201B-ms98-a-0017 42.321625 47.371750 i think alcohol's a a whole lot worse drug and it's more widely accepted
sw2201B-ms98-a-0018 47.371750 65.900750 [silence]
sw2201B-ms98-a-0019 65.900750 72.575000 i- i feel like it's okay if there's if there's cause somebody's performance is you know in[dicates]- indicates that they're
sw2201B-ms98-a-0020 72.575000 75.107000 they're obviously not all there they're
sw2201B-ms98-a-0021 75.107000 81.475125 you know you got reason to suspect they may be doing drugs and he says sure you know take them_1 down there and test them_1 but
sw2201B-ms98-a-0022 81.475125 84.602375 i think a lot of people are going to go out and
sw2201B-ms98-a-0023 84.602375 96.854125 you know substitute something else for maybe what they would have done a lot of people i don't i personally don't smoke pot but a lot of people do and they do it in their own time at their at their at their own place
sw2201B-ms98-a-0024 96.854125 101.893875 and they're going to find they're going to go out and drink instead because they know that it's their job on the line

sw2201B-ms98-a-0033 134.042750 136.649750 and the same is true of the drug hangover you know if you
sw2201B-ms98-a-0034 136.649750 142.745750 but there's i think there's a there's a big difference between use and abuse and i d[o]- do agree that drug abuse should be punished
sw2201B-ms98-a-0035 142.745750 146.384250 but if somebody's going to in their own home on their own time
sw2201B-ms98-a-0036 146.384250 151.074125 in such a way that doesn't inter[fere]- interfere with their responsibilities
sw2201B-ms98-a-0037 151.074125 155.365500 you know do it do some drugs then that should be their business
sw2201B-ms98-a-0038 155.365500 170.285375 [silence]
sw2201B-ms98-a-0039 170.285375 172.047625 yeah yeah i do

sw2201B-ms98-a-0041 178.251875 184.109375 i think i think that's true and i think that the key thing is the difference between use and abuse and a lot of people don't
sw2201B-ms98-a-0042 184.109375 186.985875 they they don't know how to
sw2201B-ms98-a-0043 186.985875 190.395000 use drugs for recreational purposes without
sw2201B-ms98-a-0044 190.395000 194.598000 it becoming you know a dominant force in their life
sw2201B-ms98-a-0045 194.598000 201.036875 i mean yeah it's it's you know it's easy for me to say i'm going to go out on Friday night and maybe
sw2201B-ms98-a-0046 201.036875 209.343125 you know i don't have to work till Monday and if i want to go out and and drink a little beer or do something and just dance a lot or whatever
sw2201B-ms98-a-0047 209.343125 219.483875 that's fine as long as i realize Saturday that in order to you know i'm going to feel like crap that's just the way it is same thing if you drink but the thing is you don't get up and drink another beer to get over it
sw2201B-ms98-a-0048 219.483875 227.311125 and and unfortunately and i think cocaine's a a good example it's it's just so much easier to just do some more do some more and then before you know it
sw2201B-ms98-a-0049 227.311125 229.744500 you know you're you're always doing it
sw2201B-ms98-a-0050 229.744500 231.096750 i don't know

sw2201B-ms98-a-0052 235.817625 239.806000 i mean i- i work for TI so i don't do drugs you know

sw2201B-ms98-a-0054 240.973875 242.036625 [silence]
sw2201B-ms98-a-0055 242.036625 244.182500 it's too big a risk yeah

sw2201B-ms98-a-0057 249.589000 252.358375 but you're without a paycheck during that time
sw2201B-ms98-a-0058 252.358375 255.018875 and i don't at least that's my understanding is even
sw2201B-ms98-a-0059 255.018875 258.752625 you know the first time you go for counseling and it's six weeks before you're back to work

sw2201B-ms98-a-0061 260.627125 263.232625 i was that i was told that uh
sw2201B-ms98-a-0062 263.232625 266.331000 somebody had uh some woman had
sw2201B-ms98-a-0063 266.331000 273.755500 had a cold or something and had some cough medicine prescribed and her husband or maybe the other way around one of them_1 anyway had uh
sw2201B-ms98-a-0064 273.755500 281.787500 come down with the same thing and used some of the medicine and was tested the next day and failed and was out of a job until he went through counseling
sw2201B-ms98-a-0065 281.787500 286.142125 and it's like you know i can't afford that kind of loss of income you know
sw2201B-ms98-a-0066 286.142125 287.677750 [silence]
sw2201B-ms98-a-0067 287.677750 293.502500 i mean i've always been yeah the first time so what i'll go explain myself and and

sw2201B-ms98-a-0069 300.460000 309.495125 that's what you would think but i kind of i that's i you know i heard it through the grapevine so i don't i don't know firsthand but that's what i heard was that it was just
sw2201B-ms98-a-0070 309.495125 311.873625 you know there there were no
sw2201B-ms98-a-0071 311.873625 324.264375 [silence]
sw2201B-ms98-a-0072 324.264375 328.458500 oh yeah you know you've got the same exact thing yeah

sw2201B-ms98-a-0074 352.366375 353.823875 well i think

sw2201B-ms98-a-0076 356.166500 358.660750 i don't know anybody personally either
sw2201B-ms98-a-0077 358.660750 366.076750 i do know a lot of people that you know do use drugs [recrela/recreationally] recreationally and there's such a big difference

sw2201B-ms98-a-0079 367.080000 368.607000 yeah i- i don't know

sw2201B-ms98-a-0081 370.859000 375.505625 you know known managers at TI i know one i guess i shouldn't make that a plural but uh
sw2201B-ms98-a-0082 375.505625 381.302750 who drank on the job had whiskey in his desk drawer and you tell me what's worse
sw2201B-ms98-a-0083 381.302750 382.421375 you know

sw2201B-ms98-a-0086 385.821750 389.042250 everybody covers up you know it's the good old boy thing
sw2201B-ms98-a-0087 389.042250 390.420750 i don't know
sw2201B-ms98-a-0088 390.420750 392.133625 [silence]
sw2201B-ms98-a-0089 392.133625 394.697750 i don't think so they don't test for it i mean
sw2201B-ms98-a-0090 394.697750 396.172875 it's not illegal
sw2201B-ms98-a-0091 396.172875 418.536000 [silence]
sw2201B-ms98-a-0092 418.536000 420.418500 well that's true

sw2201B-ms98-a-0094 423.200000 429.346750 no no i agree i think i believe in test for cause if if somebody's performance
sw2201B-ms98-a-0095 429.346750 435.849750 and i guess that there's the other argument is that well do you wait until they screw up you know and someone gets hurt
sw2201B-ms98-a-0096 435.849750 444.503875 yeah but at the same time you know you're telling me that on some given day i'm going to walk in they're going to tell me go down and you know and go down to the health center and
sw2201B-ms98-a-0097 444.503875 450.252375 you know pee in a jar or whatever it is no i haven't and so

sw2201B-ms98-a-0101 471.155250 475.361250 i have to i have to honestly say that i drink more now than i did
sw2201B-ms98-a-0102 475.361250 480.310500 because you know it's what i can get away with and if i'm going to go on the weekends

sw2201B-ms98-a-0104 482.949625 483.986250 [silence]
sw2201B-ms98-a-0105 483.986250 488.072750 if you don't drink you know you used to drink okay you go out and you want to party and that's
sw2201B-ms98-a-0106 488.072750 492.271500 that's something you do when you're young and dumb i guess

sw2201B-ms98-a-0113 514.631500 521.008125 the only thing left you know i quit doing drugs when TI said quit and it was no big deal you know it's like i wasn't
sw2201B-ms98-a-0114 521.008125 523.156250 a regular drug user
sw2201B-ms98-a-0115 523.156250 524.574000 but uh
