sw2239A-ms98-a-0002 1.597125 2.708875 hi
sw2239A-ms98-a-0003 2.708875 11.238625 [silence]
sw2239A-ms98-a-0004 11.238625 14.474500 or doing or doing public service
sw2239A-ms98-a-0005 14.474500 19.661625 [silence]
sw2239A-ms98-a-0006 19.661625 20.957625 well
sw2239A-ms98-a-0007 20.957625 25.793375 in order to go in order to join the Peace Corps you have to have a college degree
sw2239A-ms98-a-0008 25.793375 32.791750 and so that eliminates a lot of people from that and doing public service how are they supposed to support themselves
sw2239A-ms98-a-0009 32.791750 51.921625 [silence]
sw2239A-ms98-a-0010 51.921625 58.319250 well yeah i think that's a good idea although i don't i think if it's something that's forced on you
sw2239A-ms98-a-0011 58.319250 60.892750 um i think that the attitude
sw2239A-ms98-a-0012 60.892750 63.333625 is not going to be [laughter-quite] [laughter-the] same
sw2239A-ms98-a-0013 63.333625 74.579500 [silence]
sw2239A-ms98-a-0014 74.579500 75.973250 yeah
sw2239A-ms98-a-0015 75.973250 94.681125 [silence]
sw2239A-ms98-a-0016 94.681125 102.951000 yeah from what i've read most people in the United States do do some type of volunteer work at some time in their lives
sw2239A-ms98-a-0017 102.951000 109.291875 but i right but i agree it has to be at their choice and it needs to be a time when they're ready to do it
sw2239A-ms98-a-0018 109.291875 112.999000 um i don't think you can just snatch somebody away from
sw2239A-ms98-a-0019 112.999000 120.310000 you know you don't know what their circumstances are or what's going on in their life you can't just snatch them_1 away and make them_1 go do something they don't want to do
sw2239A-ms98-a-0020 120.310000 121.824000 sort of like the draft [laughter]
sw2239A-ms98-a-0021 121.824000 129.185250 [silence]
sw2239A-ms98-a-0022 129.185250 136.180875 then that raises a question of how you know are you going to pay them_1 or are you going to provide them_1 with you know
sw2239A-ms98-a-0023 136.180875 140.942375 place to live and food to eat and whether they have a family you know
sw2239A-ms98-a-0024 140.942375 142.681000 [silence]
sw2239A-ms98-a-0025 142.681000 144.069375 yeah

sw2239A-ms98-a-0027 147.893875 151.011000 that's true that's true
sw2239A-ms98-a-0028 151.011000 167.366250 [silence]
sw2239A-ms98-a-0029 167.366250 177.868250 i'm not sure i'm not sure if it's a way to cut down government expenses or it's like you said that's something more you know to to make people aware
sw2239A-ms98-a-0030 177.868250 189.327625 yeah what's going on and what needs to be done but i really do think that the pop[ulation]- that people are pretty well aware i think more so now than ever before
sw2239A-ms98-a-0031 189.327625 195.876625 [silence]
sw2239A-ms98-a-0032 195.876625 197.533250 yeah

sw2239A-ms98-a-0039 218.943500 227.127375 yeah and i think that that's the trend now i think that's the trend now and i think people are a lot more willing to give of their time
