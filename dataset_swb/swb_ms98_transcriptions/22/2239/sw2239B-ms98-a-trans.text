sw2239B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 2.701500 hi Chris this is Carol
sw2239B-ms98-a-0002 2.701500 14.691875 this is interesting uh question come up here uh proposal for people to young people to spend a year or two in the Peace Corps um or something like that doing public service i
sw2239B-ms98-a-0003 14.691875 16.980375 suppose the idea is to um
sw2239B-ms98-a-0004 16.980375 18.117750 [silence]
sw2239B-ms98-a-0005 18.117750 19.636625 i don't know [laughter]
sw2239B-ms98-a-0006 19.636625 22.646625 but but the point be to that get
sw2239B-ms98-a-0007 22.646625 28.502250 [silence]
sw2239B-ms98-a-0008 28.502250 30.387875 it sure does
sw2239B-ms98-a-0009 30.387875 33.563750 [silence]
sw2239B-ms98-a-0010 33.563750 42.486000 yeah i- i- i suppose the i[dea]- the idea would be to get um people interested in public service
sw2239B-ms98-a-0011 42.486000 52.206375 and to um i don't know maybe people give give p[eople]- give young people an appreciation for maybe what they have and what other people don't have
sw2239B-ms98-a-0012 52.206375 53.224500 um
sw2239B-ms98-a-0013 53.224500 62.695000 [silence]
sw2239B-ms98-a-0014 62.695000 71.143375 well i tend to agree and um uh in that we do live in the United States and i think one of our uh one of the
sw2239B-ms98-a-0015 71.143375 75.236000 things that our country is based on is freedom of choice
sw2239B-ms98-a-0016 75.236000 82.967875 um forcing someone to give up a couple years of their life uh doing something that may not be or
sw2239B-ms98-a-0017 82.967875 88.233250 the timing that they want to do it or uh perhaps even you know
sw2239B-ms98-a-0018 88.233250 95.982250 maybe they would have something something else just just the idea of forcing someone to do something i- i'm pretty much against that
sw2239B-ms98-a-0019 95.982250 102.298000 [silence]
sw2239B-ms98-a-0020 102.298000 105.657250 just on their own um-hum
sw2239B-ms98-a-0021 105.657250 114.058750 [silence]
sw2239B-ms98-a-0022 114.058750 115.023125 [noise]
sw2239B-ms98-a-0023 115.023125 116.591500 [silence]
sw2239B-ms98-a-0024 116.591500 118.186875 that's right
sw2239B-ms98-a-0025 118.186875 120.180000 [silence]
sw2239B-ms98-a-0026 120.180000 122.060000 [noise]
sw2239B-ms98-a-0027 122.060000 130.865125 i think there would be an awful lot of resentment and um i- i really don't think it would be feasible on our country
sw2239B-ms98-a-0028 130.865125 139.558875 [silence]
sw2239B-ms98-a-0029 139.558875 148.310000 that's right yeah some young people do some young people start families young and or maybe are responsible for their parents
sw2239B-ms98-a-0030 148.310000 150.966750 brothers and sisters things like that
sw2239B-ms98-a-0031 150.966750 154.509500 i suppose they may have exceptions but um
sw2239B-ms98-a-0032 154.509500 158.696125 i guess it all it would all boil down to
sw2239B-ms98-a-0033 158.696125 165.738000 i mainly i- i guess my question would be what what's the purpose what's what's trying to be accomplished by
sw2239B-ms98-a-0034 165.738000 167.817750 by that proposal
sw2239B-ms98-a-0035 167.817750 171.791875 [silence]
sw2239B-ms98-a-0036 171.791875 173.567375 um-hum
sw2239B-ms98-a-0037 173.567375 177.716375 [silence]
sw2239B-ms98-a-0038 177.716375 179.675375 more esoteric [laughter]
sw2239B-ms98-a-0039 179.675375 190.004000 [silence]
sw2239B-ms98-a-0040 190.004000 201.982000 you know i think that's true and i i tend to think that our children are also growing up with a bit more awareness of that at least i mean i- i feel i try to as an individual my children are very young but 
sw2239B-ms98-a-0041 201.982000 203.287250 um
sw2239B-ms98-a-0042 203.287250 206.419500 i- i think they're being taught a lot
sw2239B-ms98-a-0043 206.419500 206.995375 [silence]
sw2239B-ms98-a-0044 206.995375 209.399875 maybe to be more responsible
sw2239B-ms98-a-0045 209.399875 210.947375 and um
sw2239B-ms98-a-0046 210.947375 215.841500 hopefully to understand that everyone is not as in as fortunate
sw2239B-ms98-a-0047 215.841500 218.567875 as as perhaps they are
sw2239B-ms98-a-0048 218.567875 221.395250 [silence]
sw2239B-ms98-a-0049 221.395250 222.677125 pardon me
sw2239B-ms98-a-0050 222.677125 229.649125 [silence]
sw2239B-ms98-a-0051 229.649125 240.687250 you know its also seems to me if someone does it on a volunteer basis then they will probably put a lot more into it than if they were forced um
sw2239B-ms98-a-0052 240.687250 242.873500 that's right
sw2239B-ms98-a-0053 242.873500 245.899875 [silence]
sw2239B-ms98-a-0054 245.899875 250.733250 yeah it's an interesting idea but i think we do agree and [laughter]
sw2239B-ms98-a-0055 250.733250 255.676375 at least i'm i'm i don't think i would vote for it if it came down to that [laughter]
sw2239B-ms98-a-0056 255.676375 257.914125 [silence]
sw2239B-ms98-a-0057 257.914125 259.781625 maybe just do our best to
sw2239B-ms98-a-0058 259.781625 262.769125 to do our own fair share and [laughter]
sw2239B-ms98-a-0059 262.769125 263.848000 [laughter]
sw2239B-ms98-a-0060 263.848000 267.537375 [silence]
sw2239B-ms98-a-0061 267.537375 268.897375 [noise]
sw2239B-ms98-a-0062 268.897375 270.534250 that's right
sw2239B-ms98-a-0063 270.534250 271.825500 [silence]
sw2239B-ms98-a-0064 271.825500 278.730250 well it's been nice talking to you about it i have to admit it's something i hadn't thought of before it it is interesting to think about it [laughter]
sw2239B-ms98-a-0065 278.730250 279.841375 yes
sw2239B-ms98-a-0066 279.841375 280.469625 [laughter]
sw2239B-ms98-a-0067 280.469625 281.625750 [silence]
sw2239B-ms98-a-0068 281.625750 283.341375 okay we'll talk to you later bye-bye
sw2239B-ms98-a-0069 283.341375 285.729625 [noise]
