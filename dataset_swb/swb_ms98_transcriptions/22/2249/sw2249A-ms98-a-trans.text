sw2249A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.507500 where do you live
sw2249A-ms98-a-0002 1.507500 2.659125 [silence]
sw2249A-ms98-a-0003 2.659125 11.818000 uh-huh well i used to i lived there for a long time but i'm now in Palo Alto California which is i think the recycling capital of the world
sw2249A-ms98-a-0004 11.818000 19.400000 so we have many recycling activities and i'm in in full uh support of all of them_1
sw2249A-ms98-a-0005 19.400000 31.968375 [silence]
sw2249A-ms98-a-0006 31.968375 33.633750 um-hum
sw2249A-ms98-a-0007 33.633750 39.095000 well that's something but it it seems to me that we've gotten a whole lot better um
sw2249A-ms98-a-0008 39.095000 51.013500 cooperation out here uh by setting it up so that we pay just a little bit extra uh actually i don't think we pay very much extra at all too but the um [noise] garbage men 
sw2249A-ms98-a-0009 51.013500 56.651500 come by uh on your regular garbage day and pick up the recycling out at the curb
sw2249A-ms98-a-0010 56.651500 69.515750 [silence]
sw2249A-ms98-a-0011 69.515750 74.351750 yeah we have burlap sacks and they give us one for uh aluminum and 
sw2249A-ms98-a-0012 74.351750 76.339750 uh steel one for metals
sw2249A-ms98-a-0013 76.339750 82.512375 and one for glass and then you can either bundle your newspapers or put them_1 in grocery bags
sw2249A-ms98-a-0014 82.512375 90.222875 so we have we leave three little piles [laughter-of] [laughter-things] [laughter-out] [laughter-on] [laughter-the] [laughter-curb] every Thursday and the garbage men come by and
sw2249A-ms98-a-0015 90.222875 98.571875 uh collect them and leave us new bags when ours get old and ratty or leave the ones if they're still in good shape
sw2249A-ms98-a-0016 98.571875 107.370375 and the it really pays for itself because oh then the city gets the money from the recycling
sw2249A-ms98-a-0017 107.370375 118.054375 [silence]
sw2249A-ms98-a-0018 118.054375 124.096875 yeah the one thing i wish we could recycle is magazines but they claim that because of the way they're bound
sw2249A-ms98-a-0019 124.096875 128.801500 they uh it's too expensive to recycle them at my office we have
sw2249A-ms98-a-0020 128.801500 135.248000 two big cardboard boxes in the library where everybody goes to pick up their mail and they're uh
sw2249A-ms98-a-0021 135.248000 142.354375 one's for white paper and one's for colored paper so anything like manuscripts or computer paper or
sw2249A-ms98-a-0022 142.354375 153.684375 things like that goes in those boxes but we get tons of catalogs and things like that and magazines and there's no way to get rid of them_1 it just seems like such a waste
sw2249A-ms98-a-0023 153.684375 165.988625 [silence]
sw2249A-ms98-a-0024 165.988625 167.417500 um-hum
sw2249A-ms98-a-0025 167.417500 169.883125 [silence]
sw2249A-ms98-a-0026 169.883125 174.155625 well that would be a help i wish they would do that here we have got
sw2249A-ms98-a-0027 174.155625 181.889250 so little landfill space left that we're going to run out before the end of this decade and it's really going to be
sw2249A-ms98-a-0028 181.889250 186.316875 a mess when we have to start hunting for places to put the things
sw2249A-ms98-a-0029 186.316875 200.950000 we did have uh another novel uh experiment start this year now we can put all our yard clippings out you can you buy these super giant heavy duty paper bags they're about four feet high
sw2249A-ms98-a-0030 200.950000 208.001250 and you get them_1 for i think it's about fifty cents a piece at the grocery store um you usually buy them_1 by the dozen
sw2249A-ms98-a-0031 208.001250 217.836625 and then you put all your [lard/yard] yard clippings and uh leaf rakings and anything that will be {compostible}
sw2249A-ms98-a-0032 217.836625 222.867500 and those and the garbage men also pick those up on Thursdays
sw2249A-ms98-a-0033 222.867500 229.320500 and then the uh they take them_1 to a special part of our dump where {composting} is
sw2249A-ms98-a-0034 229.320500 240.960750 and now in full swing and at the end of every year uh they sell all the composts to nurserymen and to local people who want to put it on their [laughter-flowerbeds] 
sw2249A-ms98-a-0035 240.960750 247.955625 [silence]
sw2249A-ms98-a-0036 247.955625 249.007250 yeah
sw2249A-ms98-a-0037 249.007250 254.073250 [silence]
sw2249A-ms98-a-0038 254.073250 259.417750 if they make it so that it's not a horrendous inconvenience i think most people would
sw2249A-ms98-a-0039 259.417750 266.718375 [silence]
sw2249A-ms98-a-0040 266.718375 268.013500 right
sw2249A-ms98-a-0041 268.013500 271.972250 [silence]
sw2249A-ms98-a-0042 271.972250 277.954625 no i think it's i[t]- it's to me more of a convenience to have them come pick it up 
sw2249A-ms98-a-0043 277.954625 285.660125 than to get that two cents when you take it to the store we still have bins at the grocery stores where you can turn in bottles and cans
sw2249A-ms98-a-0044 285.660125 294.564250 for cash but so few people uh have enough to make that worthwhile you'd spend more in gas getting down there than you get back
sw2249A-ms98-a-0045 294.564250 299.267000 [silence]
sw2249A-ms98-a-0046 299.267000 305.344750 now do the grocery stores in Houston have recycling for their paper bags and plastic bags
sw2249A-ms98-a-0047 305.344750 311.927000 [silence]
sw2249A-ms98-a-0048 311.927000 312.995875 uh-huh
sw2249A-ms98-a-0049 312.995875 317.944250 [silence]
sw2249A-ms98-a-0050 317.944250 324.622625 yeah well we can get a nickel a piece for any paper bags that we bring back to be reused
sw2249A-ms98-a-0051 324.622625 329.450000 they just take it off like they do a coupon they just subtract it from your bill
sw2249A-ms98-a-0052 329.450000 339.750375 and they have a giant bin by the front door for the plastic bags and they say you know as long as it's clean they don't want the a plastic bag that's full of goop [laughter] 
sw2249A-ms98-a-0053 339.750375 343.495375 here they don't want your rotted tomatoes but they want
sw2249A-ms98-a-0054 343.495375 357.223500 any clean and dry plastic bag so i keep and the thing is i hardly have room now for all the things that we're saving it to recycle so right outside the back door i've got the two burlap bags hung up for the cans and bottles
sw2249A-ms98-a-0055 357.223500 360.371500 and [vocalized-noise] there right outside the 
sw2249A-ms98-a-0056 360.371500 364.849125 that place where the garbage can is we have the bag for the newspapers
sw2249A-ms98-a-0057 364.849125 368.663125 and now we've got the bag for the plastic [laughter-bags] 
sw2249A-ms98-a-0058 368.663125 378.198125 [silence]
sw2249A-ms98-a-0059 378.198125 379.580000 oh yeah
sw2249A-ms98-a-0060 379.580000 381.600875 [silence]
sw2249A-ms98-a-0061 381.600875 383.598750 well how nice that's great
sw2249A-ms98-a-0062 383.598750 388.748625 [silence]
sw2249A-ms98-a-0063 388.748625 389.998625 um-hum
sw2249A-ms98-a-0064 389.998625 399.402125 [silence]
sw2249A-ms98-a-0065 399.402125 400.447000 um-hum
sw2249A-ms98-a-0066 400.447000 402.107500 [silence]
sw2249A-ms98-a-0067 402.107500 402.976625 yeah
sw2249A-ms98-a-0068 402.976625 404.605625 [silence]
sw2249A-ms98-a-0069 404.605625 409.493250 well that's they just put all our Christmas trees in the regular uh compost
sw2249A-ms98-a-0070 409.493250 414.809875 pickup so they did say that you had to put it out within i think it was uh
sw2249A-ms98-a-0071 414.809875 417.311625 three weeks after Christmas and
sw2249A-ms98-a-0072 417.311625 424.228250 uh otherwise you would have to treat it like you would any other lawn refuse it would have to be cut into four foot lengths
sw2249A-ms98-a-0073 424.228250 433.680375 so you know if we have branches or something they have to be cut in four foot lengths but otherwise uh they have to be in one of their paper bags
sw2249A-ms98-a-0074 433.680375 436.973750 [silence]
sw2249A-ms98-a-0075 436.973750 440.228250 and they even picked up our uh
sw2249A-ms98-a-0076 440.228250 443.147750 styrofoam pl[astic]- packing materials
sw2249A-ms98-a-0077 443.147750 453.804375 they brought uh the week after Christmas they left a plastic bag on everybody's front doorknob with a little note on it saying we're trying something new next week only
sw2249A-ms98-a-0078 453.804375 458.861125 if you have any uh of those little uh styrofoam peanuts that
sw2249A-ms98-a-0079 458.861125 469.156000 any of your Christmas presents were packed in put them_1 in this bag and leave it out with your recycling and we'll uh take all of those back and try to recycle them 
sw2249A-ms98-a-0080 469.156000 474.720000 but i that's not going to be a regular feature that was just a one time thing right after Christmas
sw2249A-ms98-a-0081 474.720000 477.941125 [silence]
sw2249A-ms98-a-0082 477.941125 482.316625 well those things must take up a huge amount of space in landfills
sw2249A-ms98-a-0083 482.316625 483.661375 [silence]
sw2249A-ms98-a-0084 483.661375 489.129250 they don't mash [laughter] they don't compress at all and they stay forever
sw2249A-ms98-a-0085 489.129250 496.838625 [silence]
sw2249A-ms98-a-0086 496.838625 498.068250 um-hum
sw2249A-ms98-a-0087 498.068250 505.009125 [silence]
sw2249A-ms98-a-0088 505.009125 515.621000 yeah i do too the difficulty with that is that very few people have enough to make it worthwhile it they really have to rely on businesses that generate a lot of that stuff
sw2249A-ms98-a-0089 515.621000 530.024000 uh because otherwise uh you know they're not going to go house to house collecting it and you're not going to bother if you have one bag full to drive all the way to some recycling center to turn in just your little plastic peanuts [laughter]
sw2249A-ms98-a-0090 530.024000 536.344000 [silence]
sw2249A-ms98-a-0091 536.344000 537.462750 yeah
sw2249A-ms98-a-0092 537.462750 543.045375 [silence]
sw2249A-ms98-a-0093 543.045375 549.786000 now we quit that about two years ago no three years ago when we got China mugs for everybody
sw2249A-ms98-a-0094 549.786000 562.168125 so and the only difficulty with that is that we're in the middle of a five year drought and so i- it's a real difficult choice whether we want styrofoam cups to fill up our landfills or
sw2249A-ms98-a-0095 562.168125 566.293750 uh China cups to use up our water [laughter]
sw2249A-ms98-a-0096 566.293750 570.600250 but at the moment we're using the China cups
sw2249A-ms98-a-0097 570.600250 577.516500 and everybody gets one at the beginning of the year and then uh you're supposed to keep it recycled every day
sw2249A-ms98-a-0098 577.516500 578.992250 [silence]
sw2249A-ms98-a-0099 578.992250 579.896000 yeah
sw2249A-ms98-a-0100 579.896000 581.276375 [silence]
sw2249A-ms98-a-0101 581.276375 590.704875 well let us hope that everybody's going to be paying more attention to this and that we will get uh better reuse of things because
sw2249A-ms98-a-0102 590.704875 594.475750 [silence]
sw2249A-ms98-a-0103 594.475750 595.433500 yep
sw2249A-ms98-a-0104 595.433500 596.720000 [silence]
sw2249A-ms98-a-0105 596.720000 599.082500 it sure will well good to talk to
