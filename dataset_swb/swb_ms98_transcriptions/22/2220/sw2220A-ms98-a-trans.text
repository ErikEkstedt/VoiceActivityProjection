sw2220A-ms98-a-0069 419.692125 430.739625 that'd probably be pretty interesting i was summoned down to the courthouse last week they had summoned eight hundred people about four hundred showed up and it was for a murder trial
sw2220A-ms98-a-0070 430.739625 444.384125 this guy had supposedly uh strangled this woman and stuffed cotton toweling down her throat and up her [laughter-nose] anyway this is happened in nineteen eighty three
sw2220A-ms98-a-0071 444.384125 456.934875 and they had us fill out a long questionnaire we stayed till about one thirty and they're going to call the ones that they're interested in from the questionnaire two to three at a time and the trial won't take place until June
sw2220A-ms98-a-0072 456.934875 466.960500 and they say it's going to last about two to three weeks and this guy in front of me said i can't believe i was summoned i was an investigator and i was tailing the woman that was killed
sw2220A-ms98-a-0073 466.960500 473.491625 well then i have a friend at school that has a boyfriend that's a lawyer and he said that this woman
sw2220A-ms98-a-0074 473.491625 485.994375 this socialite in Plano had hired four guys to kill her husband and the one that's accused was the one that actually did it and she has since taken off with another lawyer who had been uh
sw2220A-ms98-a-0075 485.994375 500.264625 getting cocaine from his client and then selling it and he had skipped bail and they finally extradited him and he's going to testify for the state against her so he'll have his sentence reduced
