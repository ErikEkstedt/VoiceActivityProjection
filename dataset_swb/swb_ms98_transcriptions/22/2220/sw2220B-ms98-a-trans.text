sw2220B-ms98-a-0094 513.742375 526.209750 well not necessarily but there's probably something else that might make you because_1 you could know about you could know about the crime but not necessarily be taken off the jury you know not be accepted for jur[y]- the jury
sw2220B-ms98-a-0095 526.209750 534.425875 you i mean pretty much a lot of people would know about it you know an[d]- and know some of the different things about it but um
sw2220B-ms98-a-0096 534.425875 548.696125 th[ey]- they might weed you out some other way you know if you if you don't believe like if this was a capital crime an[d]- and you don't believe in if you don't believe in death penalty you're not going to be picked at all so but
