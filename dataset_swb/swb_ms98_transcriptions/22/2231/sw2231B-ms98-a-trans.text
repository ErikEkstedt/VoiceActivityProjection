sw2231B-ms98-a-0002 8.601375 12.045125 in the way that it's applied or that it's applied at all 
sw2231B-ms98-a-0003 12.045125 13.176500 [silence]
sw2231B-ms98-a-0004 13.176500 16.726000 so i how do you feel that it should be applied
sw2231B-ms98-a-0005 16.726000 26.556750 [silence]
sw2231B-ms98-a-0006 26.556750 30.235000 and that that the penalty ought to be out there and be enforced
sw2231B-ms98-a-0007 30.235000 33.865375 [silence]
sw2231B-ms98-a-0008 33.865375 35.371750 yes
sw2231B-ms98-a-0009 35.371750 40.240000 [silence]
sw2231B-ms98-a-0010 40.240000 47.095125 that's i agree with that completely i know we don't have enough prisons but there has got to be some kind of punishment for these people
sw2231B-ms98-a-0011 47.095125 60.365125 because_1 if they turn around they can get away they get away with it and they get away with it and they get away with it and then they do something worse and they get a slap on the wrist they get thirty days in jail and they finally get up to where they kill somebody else and they go through fourteen appeals and
sw2231B-ms98-a-0012 60.365125 63.927750 how many hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars
sw2231B-ms98-a-0013 63.927750 65.514125 and it's
sw2231B-ms98-a-0014 65.514125 71.174375 [silence]
sw2231B-ms98-a-0015 71.174375 74.483500 well they certainly are living off our ex[pense]- at our expense
sw2231B-ms98-a-0016 74.483500 75.632500 [silence]
sw2231B-ms98-a-0017 75.632500 76.690750 i didn't
sw2231B-ms98-a-0018 76.690750 83.998375 [silence]
sw2231B-ms98-a-0019 83.998375 85.234125 yes
sw2231B-ms98-a-0020 85.234125 95.729000 [silence]
sw2231B-ms98-a-0021 95.729000 97.104250 um-hum
sw2231B-ms98-a-0022 97.104250 101.146625 [silence]
sw2231B-ms98-a-0023 101.146625 112.926250 and and be paroled and and have served the sentence that's what that's what people face with that choice one thing i really hate is they don't explain to the jurors in a in a trial on a capital murder trial or in 
sw2231B-ms98-a-0024 112.926250 118.527000 cases of rape or in different things that are so horrible what it means when they sentence them to
sw2231B-ms98-a-0025 118.527000 129.518375 you know they'll sentence them to ninety years and say that it's you know that it's going to you know that should be life but instead in in given the choice of either sentencing to death or sentencing to life they'll give them ninety years in prison or something
sw2231B-ms98-a-0026 129.518375 133.428750 and then turn around in thirty years that you know and less they're out
sw2231B-ms98-a-0027 133.428750 144.025125 even if if they're even in that long or they appeal and then they get an appeal that says it was you know an unjust amount of time it was an extraordinary long length or something 
sw2231B-ms98-a-0028 144.025125 149.404750 [silence]
sw2231B-ms98-a-0029 149.404750 150.871875 yeah
sw2231B-ms98-a-0030 150.871875 155.949375 i'd like to see the death penalty more as a deterrent i think people know that nobody that it doesn't
sw2231B-ms98-a-0031 155.949375 159.563500 you know i[t]- it's not a deterrent right now because it's not really effective
sw2231B-ms98-a-0032 159.563500 168.288750 there's [noise] should be you know this for this crime this is the penalty you killed someone you know in cold blood or whatever this is what's going to happen
sw2231B-ms98-a-0033 168.288750 172.793125 and i mean it sounds horrible it i i hear myself saying this and 
sw2231B-ms98-a-0034 172.793125 184.407750 but i don't know what else to do with some of these people that are because_1 they let them back out again and they do the same thing over and over again then they put them back in jail and they get out and and more and more innocent people are hurt or killed
sw2231B-ms98-a-0035 184.407750 188.242875 and these guys just are on the endless merry-go-round in the legal system
sw2231B-ms98-a-0036 188.242875 190.594125 and it's like i said at our expense
sw2231B-ms98-a-0037 190.594125 198.367375 [silence]
sw2231B-ms98-a-0038 198.367375 199.576875 yes
sw2231B-ms98-a-0039 199.576875 201.530000 [silence]
sw2231B-ms98-a-0040 201.530000 206.080125 i know i you read about it in the paper every day somebody who's done this or that
sw2231B-ms98-a-0041 206.080125 207.404000 something
sw2231B-ms98-a-0042 207.404000 210.801750 really horrible and they just get away with it and nothing happens
sw2231B-ms98-a-0043 210.801750 216.447500 [silence]
sw2231B-ms98-a-0044 216.447500 218.109250 yeah
sw2231B-ms98-a-0045 218.109250 223.432625 i think i think Texas is wha[t]- Texas the southern states seem to be
sw2231B-ms98-a-0046 223.432625 232.449875 somewhat more conservative and still have the death penalty and i think i know California had it for a long time and then they um took it off the books they repealed it
sw2231B-ms98-a-0047 232.449875 240.037500 and people like Charles Manson and and some of these other people who were sentenced to death at the time they repealed the death penalty were sentenced to life in prison
sw2231B-ms98-a-0048 240.037500 244.447875 and are now now that even though California has reinstated the death penalty
sw2231B-ms98-a-0049 244.447875 258.011875 for whatever various crimes the people who were there originally when they when they changed the laws to revoke the death penalty are still in there for are in prison in quote for life and and are now coming up for parole some of them like Manson who's come up
sw2231B-ms98-a-0050 258.011875 260.610875 you know it's been denied fortunately but
sw2231B-ms98-a-0051 260.610875 262.250500 [silence]
sw2231B-ms98-a-0052 262.250500 266.268625 yeah well the jury that originally sentenced him sentenced him to death
sw2231B-ms98-a-0053 266.268625 279.545750 and then while he was on appeal on his thousandth and one appeal the state of California [reverked/revoked] revoked the law in the early seventies and then they reinstated it later but the penalty didn't go back you know
sw2231B-ms98-a-0054 279.545750 287.312000 it seems like a lot of times the law is is totally on the criminal side and and isn't protecting the rest of the people
sw2231B-ms98-a-0055 287.312000 292.775125 [silence]
sw2231B-ms98-a-0056 292.775125 294.108375 um-hum
sw2231B-ms98-a-0057 294.108375 296.666375 [silence]
sw2231B-ms98-a-0058 296.666375 298.054000 yeah
sw2231B-ms98-a-0059 298.054000 299.650000 [silence]
sw2231B-ms98-a-0060 299.650000 311.944875 and the the laws are all the rules some of the things that would make sense to to tell the jury that this this guy has a a prior [vocalized-noise] criminal history you know where he's raped ten women
sw2231B-ms98-a-0061 311.944875 318.071625 and then he gets up for this one trial and they don't find anything out about the facts that he's done this over and over and over again
sw2231B-ms98-a-0062 318.071625 326.043750 and so they say well this is you know i- i don't know if they say it's the first time offense or whatever but they give him a lighter sentence thinking he's not a habitual criminal
sw2231B-ms98-a-0063 326.043750 328.748750 [silence]
sw2231B-ms98-a-0064 328.748750 330.476500 yeah well
sw2231B-ms98-a-0065 330.476500 337.347500 to some extent if they would do something with some of those people but that seems to be a good way to get off for a lot of them_1 too
sw2231B-ms98-a-0066 337.347500 343.633125 they plead insanity and then three years later they're cured and let loose on society again
sw2231B-ms98-a-0067 343.633125 348.023625 [silence]
sw2231B-ms98-a-0068 348.023625 358.193500 i mean it's a it's a scary world out there anymore where your afraid to go out i know in in the Dallas metroplex area i don't go out hardly if i don't have to at night by myself
sw2231B-ms98-a-0069 358.193500 363.634375 and i- i certainly i i grew up in a smaller town in Texas and it wasn't that way when i was younger
sw2231B-ms98-a-0070 363.634375 365.933000 we could go around and boy
sw2231B-ms98-a-0071 365.933000 378.246750 [silence]
sw2231B-ms98-a-0072 378.246750 380.455125 yes ever you can't even
sw2231B-ms98-a-0073 380.455125 392.101375 when i was a kid i would run between my neighbors three and four blocks sometimes and as long as my mom had a general idea where i was and i was back on the time and now i don't let my kids out of the front yard that i can't see them_1
sw2231B-ms98-a-0074 392.101375 397.329125 [silence]
sw2231B-ms98-a-0075 397.329125 398.778000 um-hum [noise]
