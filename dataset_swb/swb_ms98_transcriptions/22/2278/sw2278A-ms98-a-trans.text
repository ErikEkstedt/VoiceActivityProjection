sw2278A-ms98-a-0053 179.538000 185.293625 and they they were you know they were they were pretty much without having to say it they were pretty much Mets fans [laughter]
sw2278A-ms98-a-0054 185.293625 188.993500 [silence]
sw2278A-ms98-a-0055 188.993500 193.725625 no not really they they were they were pretty much thugs they weren't scared of very much you know [laughter]

sw2278A-ms98-a-0065 212.405750 214.444625 [laughter]
sw2278A-ms98-a-0066 214.444625 222.825375 so i'm kind of hoping i i i guess uh anymore i pretty much pull for the Rangers though they were uh they're they're they're they they have the i think they have the best
sw2278A-ms98-a-0067 222.825375 225.224875 facilities in the major leagues
sw2278A-ms98-a-0068 225.224875 228.183625 i love going to watch a game in Arlington stadium it's great

sw2278A-ms98-a-0072 236.554500 246.004375 the only problem is it's not large enough it only holds about i think they s[queezed]- when Ryan struck out his five thousandth player they they squeezed about forty thousand people in there
sw2278A-ms98-a-0073 246.004375 252.583500 yeah so they're they're they have plans i mean the the owner tried to move them_1 to Florida but uh
sw2278A-ms98-a-0074 252.583500 258.815000 they ended up sticking around in Arlington and they're going to build a new stadium in Arlington as a matter of fact not even in Dallas so that's
sw2278A-ms98-a-0075 258.815000 260.932375 that's something that we're looking forward to
sw2278A-ms98-a-0076 260.932375 265.990625 [silence]
