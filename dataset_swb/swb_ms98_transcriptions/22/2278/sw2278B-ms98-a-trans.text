sw2278B-ms98-a-0004 14.017375 17.275250 oh i was going to say you played pro ball [vocalized-noise]

sw2278B-ms98-a-0006 19.008250 22.780000 [silence]
sw2278B-ms98-a-0007 22.780000 24.848000 well that's pretty good
sw2278B-ms98-a-0008 24.848000 27.019375 [silence]
sw2278B-ms98-a-0009 27.019375 30.820500 yes i'm actually a Met's fan i'm i'm one of these people who's actually a
sw2278B-ms98-a-0010 30.820500 34.417500 die hard Met fan and an avid Yankee hater
sw2278B-ms98-a-0011 34.417500 37.068875 [silence]
sw2278B-ms98-a-0012 37.068875 45.568625 yeah it's it's i i i find it very strange um more people you know real Met fans don't like the Yankees and real Yankee fans don't like the Mets for some reason
sw2278B-ms98-a-0013 45.568625 48.235875 i never fou[nd]- i never quite found a New York fan
sw2278B-ms98-a-0014 48.235875 51.896500 i've always found a fan you know of of either one or the other and
sw2278B-ms98-a-0015 51.896500 56.649625 so that of course means that when it comes to the American League my favorite team is the Red Sox
sw2278B-ms98-a-0016 56.649625 59.517000 by default because_1 i went to college also in Boston
sw2278B-ms98-a-0017 59.517000 67.164375 [silence]
sw2278B-ms98-a-0018 67.164375 68.318375 oh

sw2278B-ms98-a-0020 69.538250 71.806500 yeah so that that's sort of close enough
sw2278B-ms98-a-0021 71.806500 73.551500 [silence]
sw2278B-ms98-a-0022 73.551500 75.238000 oh so you were pretty close
sw2278B-ms98-a-0023 75.238000 78.763500 [silence]
sw2278B-ms98-a-0024 78.763500 85.534000 well i don't know um there's there's a part of me that says that you know i'm i'm sort of glad Strawberry went away
sw2278B-ms98-a-0025 85.534000 92.691500 you know when when he sort of went away i started thinking yeah well he was performing fairly well but he really wasn't worth the baggage you know
sw2278B-ms98-a-0026 92.691500 97.463750 um i think they're okay i think they're you know i think they have enough people who are
sw2278B-ms98-a-0027 97.463750 105.489125 who are who are still in their prime you know um i mean certainly if you look at them compared to let's say you know um
sw2278B-ms98-a-0028 105.489125 115.073625 just eight years ago or something they're they're they're they're you know they're sort of in [noise] in good standing whereas you know um [noise] i think 
sw2278B-ms98-a-0029 115.073625 117.675500 i certainly don't think that they're the eighty six team anymore
sw2278B-ms98-a-0030 117.675500 120.830625 [silence]
sw2278B-ms98-a-0031 120.830625 122.396750 yeah i

sw2278B-ms98-a-0033 125.497125 131.321125 right that was year they beat Houston in extra innings and then and then they actually won the series by 
sw2278B-ms98-a-0034 131.321125 134.775375 by sort of a sneaky route um against Boston
sw2278B-ms98-a-0035 134.775375 138.823375 when there was the ball that was sort of hit to Buck[ner]- to Buckner [vocalized-noise]
sw2278B-ms98-a-0036 138.823375 141.653875 i felt real bad about that but hey what can you do
sw2278B-ms98-a-0037 141.653875 143.476125 [silence]
sw2278B-ms98-a-0038 143.476125 150.288250 that's right well actually he he he was supposedly um there was there was something wrong with him at the time and i
sw2278B-ms98-a-0039 150.288250 157.712875 right and i and i understand that and i say hey if the guy can't play you don't blame the team that uh hit it to him you blame the team you know for putting him in
sw2278B-ms98-a-0040 157.712875 159.201875 that's right so
sw2278B-ms98-a-0041 159.201875 163.402375 so i i i was uh i was also i was in school at Boston at the time
sw2278B-ms98-a-0042 163.402375 170.438375 so i it was actually wonderful because_1 where i was there were half Met fans and um half Sox fans
sw2278B-ms98-a-0043 170.438375 175.852250 [silence]
sw2278B-ms98-a-0044 175.852250 177.022375 oh

sw2278B-ms98-a-0050 189.915875 191.441875 after the uh
sw2278B-ms98-a-0051 191.441875 192.679250 [silence]
sw2278B-ms98-a-0052 192.679250 195.514750 well that's good well yeah Brooklyn boys i guess
sw2278B-ms98-a-0053 195.514750 201.002750 [vocalized-noise] you don't expect them_1 to be uh much of anything but thugs no i know i was born there [laughter-um]
sw2278B-ms98-a-0054 201.002750 207.008250 yeah so i i wa[s]- i was also born in Brooklyn so i so i can call myself a Brooklyn thug although i'm really not

sw2278B-ms98-a-0061 229.087875 234.953125 well that that's actually i think that makes something because_1 i think and and and as much as sort of fan support helps
sw2278B-ms98-a-0062 234.953125 237.193750 you know it's good to have um
sw2278B-ms98-a-0063 237.193750 244.864875 [silence]
sw2278B-ms98-a-0064 244.864875 246.639000 yes it is kind of small

sw2278B-ms98-a-0068 256.818250 257.978500 oh that's
sw2278B-ms98-a-0069 257.978500 260.197750 oh that's great so
sw2278B-ms98-a-0070 260.197750 266.656625 yeah that'll be nice i mean that that i think tends to just keep i think stadiums have worked tend to keep people happy [laughter]
sw2278B-ms98-a-0071 266.656625 268.027875 and
sw2278B-ms98-a-0072 268.027875 270.020500 yeah exactly
sw2278B-ms98-a-0073 270.020500 273.432625 uh i haven't been to any Toronto games yet but um
sw2278B-ms98-a-0074 273.432625 282.082625 [silence]
sw2278B-ms98-a-0075 282.082625 291.989250 of stadiums yeah well i i mean to get up there i mean the the best i've been up here so far you know up in in in up state New York is uh is um
sw2278B-ms98-a-0076 291.989250 294.102250 a Rochester Red Wings game
sw2278B-ms98-a-0077 294.102250 297.224750 [silence]
sw2278B-ms98-a-0078 297.224750 299.303500 uh Cornell is in Ithaca
sw2278B-ms98-a-0079 299.303500 307.151750 uh yeah so Cornell is about um somewhere uh about two and a half hours south of south and east of us
sw2278B-ms98-a-0080 307.151750 310.703875 so if you know where Lake Ontario is sort of i[s]- uh
sw2278B-ms98-a-0081 310.703875 319.692750 yeah we're about ten miles south of Lake Ontario actually whoever built the city was an idiot in my opinion because they built it they built it far enough from the city that it actually couldn't be a port city
sw2278B-ms98-a-0082 319.692750 322.563000 um but that
sw2278B-ms98-a-0083 322.563000 326.161125 [silence]
sw2278B-ms98-a-0084 326.161125 329.113375 oh really i ne[ver]- i hadn't actually known that
sw2278B-ms98-a-0085 329.113375 330.446625 well um
sw2278B-ms98-a-0086 330.446625 334.412000 but we have our own um our our own triple A team here 
sw2278B-ms98-a-0087 334.412000 343.654000 the Redwings which is the uh farm team for the Orioles so everybody hopes that uh they go all the way around here they're the they're the big team in Rochester
sw2278B-ms98-a-0088 343.654000 345.330250 [silence]
sw2278B-ms98-a-0089 345.330250 350.265625 oh i yeah i actually we we we make a point of going to a bunch of them_1 every year because they're fun because_1 they're
sw2278B-ms98-a-0090 350.265625 358.754750 lots of really big you know lots of local fans you know small stadium you know um and they'll get a crowd of less than ten thousand sometimes you know um
sw2278B-ms98-a-0091 358.754750 365.897875 especially you know and i'll um i'll make a day game or something but they really seem to um people really get into it i mean i
sw2278B-ms98-a-0092 365.897875 371.273750 i can't i i again i can't make any predictions about them but i suspect they'll go uh they'll go far
sw2278B-ms98-a-0093 371.273750 385.086500 [silence]
sw2278B-ms98-a-0094 385.086500 390.570000 yeah tho[se]- those are those are always the i i think those are more fun than major league games sometimes
sw2278B-ms98-a-0095 390.570000 392.290000 [silence]
sw2278B-ms98-a-0096 392.290000 394.308000 yes it's true well
sw2278B-ms98-a-0097 394.308000 402.953000 it's one of the advantages of not having pitchers who are uh uh you know i g[uess]- i guess when you start pitching real well well move them_1 up bam you know there goes the little the uh worst team
sw2278B-ms98-a-0098 402.953000 405.517625 yeah but um so what
sw2278B-ms98-a-0099 405.517625 414.169500 [silence]
sw2278B-ms98-a-0100 414.169500 415.611750 [laughter]

sw2278B-ms98-a-0103 422.609750 427.553000 well the way i the way i see it is i mean um you know i i can use a Met analogy here
sw2278B-ms98-a-0104 427.553000 433.568000 if you'll think back a few years to when the Mets were just all this sort of young bunch of guys who really were raw talent but weren't very sort of
sw2278B-ms98-a-0105 433.568000 444.219875 well trained you know back to the you know maybe eighty um eighty four or or eighty three or or eighty five you know when they were first when they weren't quite the eighty six team that that that they were um
sw2278B-ms98-a-0106 444.219875 451.722625 i that that probably gives the readers a good shot for you know this year or next year i think it you know the young talent really sort of has to build itself up
sw2278B-ms98-a-0107 451.722625 456.603125 [silence]
sw2278B-ms98-a-0108 456.603125 459.755500 [laughter]

sw2278B-ms98-a-0110 466.480125 469.320375 right but that that's if i[f]-

sw2278B-ms98-a-0112 475.232625 476.790625 oh that must be nice

sw2278B-ms98-a-0116 484.640875 487.510000 yeah well it'd take me a good seven hours to get to Shay Stadium
sw2278B-ms98-a-0117 487.510000 490.138750 [laughter-so] so i don't know i don't

sw2278B-ms98-a-0120 498.599000 506.776875 it's it's almost four hundred hour[s]- i mean i mean it it's almost four hundred you know barring traffic it's four hundred hours i mean i mean four hundred mi[les]- four hundred hours right [laughter] four hundred miles
sw2278B-ms98-a-0121 506.776875 515.504125 barring traffic so it's um it it's uh you know it's it's a heck of a drive we are substantially north of New York enough that uh we don't get to go play
sw2278B-ms98-a-0122 515.504125 516.840250 too often
sw2278B-ms98-a-0123 516.840250 521.807000 [silence]

sw2278B-ms98-a-0142 582.808625 589.277625 but um we were i mean um you know all schools were closed for almost for for over or for for a week
sw2278B-ms98-a-0143 589.277625 593.050500 there were certain parts of town where it was illegal to drive
sw2278B-ms98-a-0144 593.050500 596.823500 yeah because they had so many power lines down and so many uh
sw2278B-ms98-a-0145 596.823500 599.146125 and so many things like that so they were
