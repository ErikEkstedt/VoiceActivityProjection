sw2289B-ms98-a-0002 4.189000 9.758875 okay well is your does your city have mandatory re[cycling]- uh recycling
sw2289B-ms98-a-0003 9.758875 22.754500 [silence]
sw2289B-ms98-a-0004 22.754500 29.174375 um there there's some places that are strongly encouraging it then that the city will pick it up
sw2289B-ms98-a-0005 29.174375 36.686625 that's been one of the arguments here i'm just sitting here looking we've got four bins of glass and plasticine stuff but we have to carry it
sw2289B-ms98-a-0006 36.686625 48.468750 um some distance and some places um you can sell your uh recyclables and um for example um our church was was collecting newspapers
sw2289B-ms98-a-0007 48.468750 53.702875 [silence]
sw2289B-ms98-a-0008 53.702875 63.774125 well it turns out that so much the problem in Texas is that uh they've got so much paper now from people recycling that they've got no way to uh reprocess it
sw2289B-ms98-a-0009 63.774125 73.792125 that it requires an ex[tremely]- it requires uh essentially a paper mill to recycle it and so the value has gone down it [vocalized-noise] turns out it wasn't worth it for the church to do 
sw2289B-ms98-a-0010 73.792125 99.989125 [silence]
sw2289B-ms98-a-0011 99.989125 101.483000 well
sw2289B-ms98-a-0012 101.483000 108.182250 yeah well see that's in in Dallas there there no plan to build i think that there's some in East Texas there's some pulp
sw2289B-ms98-a-0013 108.182250 117.286875 mills but uh you have to go to Houston and uh it's interesting and then there's places that'll buy metal and they still buy aluminum can in fact that
sw2289B-ms98-a-0014 117.286875 122.987750 [silence]
sw2289B-ms98-a-0015 122.987750 125.984500 well do you do do you do recycling
sw2289B-ms98-a-0016 125.984500 129.999125 [silence]
sw2289B-ms98-a-0017 129.999125 131.254000 oh
sw2289B-ms98-a-0018 131.254000 149.199125 [silence]
sw2289B-ms98-a-0019 149.199125 153.253625 well do you do you drink soda and such in aluminum cans
sw2289B-ms98-a-0020 153.253625 162.257250 [silence]
sw2289B-ms98-a-0021 162.257250 170.525500 oh so it's worth taking them back well see we don't have we have we have most of our soft drinks are in plastic liter or two liter bottles
sw2289B-ms98-a-0022 170.525500 183.722750 [silence]
sw2289B-ms98-a-0023 183.722750 193.735000 oh that's in[teresting]- you know that you know that there is a down side to all this you know about no good deed going unpunished that uh my mother sells um
sw2289B-ms98-a-0024 193.735000 199.035625 trees that they make paper out of and so every time i recycle newspapers
sw2289B-ms98-a-0025 199.035625 204.654500 uh in fact there's uh there's a uh Kimberly and Clark the the makers of kleenex and such
sw2289B-ms98-a-0026 204.654500 218.697500 has a uh a big uh paper mill that fact i almost went to work for them_1 i was offered a job and turned it down because_1 my mother got it for me but it's twenty or thirty miles from my house every time you recycle that's one less tree my mother can sell and uh 
sw2289B-ms98-a-0027 218.697500 223.476125 so it's a question should i be diligent and um um
sw2289B-ms98-a-0028 223.476125 228.205250 and and recycle and put my mother out of her livelihood
sw2289B-ms98-a-0029 228.205250 237.767750 but it it it's an interesting point though that uh you know everybody's so anxious to recycle and i suppose it does provide some gainful employment but uh
sw2289B-ms98-a-0030 237.767750 240.991750 [silence]
sw2289B-ms98-a-0031 240.991750 253.272750 well but in general i think it's a good idea because there's like the glass uh you can't argue that the glass it doesn't biodegrade and and uh the plastics obviously they don't 
sw2289B-ms98-a-0032 253.272750 254.273125 [silence]
sw2289B-ms98-a-0033 254.273125 257.506500 so we might as well recycle those
sw2289B-ms98-a-0034 257.506500 271.993750 [silence]
sw2289B-ms98-a-0035 271.993750 273.477875 yeah
sw2289B-ms98-a-0036 273.477875 275.802875 [silence]
sw2289B-ms98-a-0037 275.802875 285.771375 well that's what we've got ours we we started about New Year's we decided we'd get ambitious we took one load over there and now we've got these containers filling up with stuff and
sw2289B-ms98-a-0038 285.771375 291.923375 you know it it it's not a very high priority thing to go haul these uh containers over there
sw2289B-ms98-a-0039 291.923375 325.816500 [silence]
sw2289B-ms98-a-0040 325.816500 328.029875 yeah
sw2289B-ms98-a-0041 328.029875 352.487875 [silence]
sw2289B-ms98-a-0042 352.487875 355.973000 but every little bit helps right
sw2289B-ms98-a-0043 355.973000 368.479750 [silence]
sw2289B-ms98-a-0044 368.479750 371.674000 w[hat]-
sw2289B-ms98-a-0045 371.674000 373.997000 [silence]
sw2289B-ms98-a-0046 373.997000 377.300125 well do you have separate trash cans at your desk
sw2289B-ms98-a-0047 377.300125 382.977000 [silence]
sw2289B-ms98-a-0048 382.977000 397.198250 well we have we have one that's recyclable and and then for uh lunch sacks and and waste food and and they gave us a list of things that aren't re[cycle]- and it turns out it's not so bad i- i- i get a lot of reports that that are covered in plastic
sw2289B-ms98-a-0049 397.198250 406.487125 or plas[tic]- like Saran Wrap or something anyway and then uh and cardboard there's a few interesting that we're we're recycling computer type paper
sw2289B-ms98-a-0050 406.487125 416.453875 and and and uh one day they'll pick up uh the the cleaning people come through and they'll pick up recycled paper and then the next day they'll pick up the other so
sw2289B-ms98-a-0051 416.453875 425.191375 depending on how much uh you know and there's a lot of uh actually it works pretty well and then we have uh uh waste
sw2289B-ms98-a-0052 425.191375 431.231500 uh cans for aluminum in the in the break areas at work and so
sw2289B-ms98-a-0053 431.231500 438.293500 [silence]
sw2289B-ms98-a-0054 438.293500 439.758625 oh
sw2289B-ms98-a-0055 439.758625 449.758500 [silence]
sw2289B-ms98-a-0056 449.758500 451.436375 yeah
sw2289B-ms98-a-0057 451.436375 474.976125 [silence]
sw2289B-ms98-a-0058 474.976125 477.952375 that's an interesting distinction that
sw2289B-ms98-a-0059 477.952375 486.695500 [silence]
sw2289B-ms98-a-0060 486.695500 488.487750 yeah
sw2289B-ms98-a-0061 488.487750 499.231125 [silence]
sw2289B-ms98-a-0062 499.231125 511.697625 well see well see those of us that don't have state income taxes yet that's the big debate here in Texas that they their the legislature wants to put one in and it's interesting what people get upset about uh
sw2289B-ms98-a-0063 511.697625 514.996500 it it really is the the
sw2289B-ms98-a-0064 514.996500 526.172750 well no the the big issue was is is uh when we moved here a few years ago is whether it was okay for you to uh drink beer while you were driving your pickup truck
sw2289B-ms98-a-0065 526.172750 529.490750 and throw it out the at the and at uh
sw2289B-ms98-a-0066 529.490750 531.491625 so
sw2289B-ms98-a-0067 531.491625 543.976000 we['re]- we're now civilized now you can no longer you you cannot drink beer and drive but uh but it it was it was actually legal [vocalized-noise] 
sw2289B-ms98-a-0068 543.976000 550.465875 [silence]
sw2289B-ms98-a-0069 550.465875 552.393750 [laughter]
sw2289B-ms98-a-0070 552.393750 572.454250 [silence]
sw2289B-ms98-a-0071 572.454250 573.759000 yeah
sw2289B-ms98-a-0072 573.759000 580.770250 [silence]
sw2289B-ms98-a-0073 580.770250 582.695000 well you know the other
sw2289B-ms98-a-0074 582.695000 583.755250 [silence]
sw2289B-ms98-a-0075 583.755250 591.986625 well the other thing is it also is is a is a a good habit uh to uh just to conserve resources
sw2289B-ms98-a-0076 591.986625 599.540000 you know whether you know because_1 when you get in the habit of doing that you think in terms of of uh of of things like saving gas
