sw2289A-ms98-a-0002 0.253625 4.814625 okay we we can uh be recorded while we talk about it
sw2289A-ms98-a-0003 4.814625 8.479625 [silence]
sw2289A-ms98-a-0004 8.479625 19.984000 no we don't have mandatory we actually we're kind of slow up here and we've just started doing recycling probably last summer and it's all voluntary
sw2289A-ms98-a-0005 19.984000 24.214750 so that's interesting cities have a mandatory recycling
sw2289A-ms98-a-0006 24.214750 47.280250 [silence]
sw2289A-ms98-a-0007 47.280250 54.941875 yeah [vocalized-noise] wh[en]- when i was a kid we used to collect newspapers and bring them_1 to a recycle thing we got like a penny a pound for them_1 
sw2289A-ms98-a-0008 54.941875 63.272375 [silence]
sw2289A-ms98-a-0009 63.272375 65.483500 oh my
sw2289A-ms98-a-0010 65.483500 73.260375 [silence]
sw2289A-ms98-a-0011 73.260375 78.261500 wow i didn't i didn't realize you would think now up here
sw2289A-ms98-a-0012 78.261500 92.631125 i- i suppose they send it all back to the mill and there are paper mills within a couple of hundred miles of uh actually there is one in northern Vermont so there's probably a paper mill that's sixty miles from here i didn't think that
sw2289A-ms98-a-0013 92.631125 102.934500 you know in the large city that if the next recycling if the next mill is more like five hundred miles away it's a lot of money to transport
sw2289A-ms98-a-0014 102.934500 116.284375 [silence]
sw2289A-ms98-a-0015 116.284375 124.750375 do you have to buy metal copper is a very uh good one to collect even aluminum yeah so 
sw2289A-ms98-a-0016 124.750375 137.722125 uh we do do recycling and our city will pick up our recyclables they have these little blue bins um i don't recycle personally i i'm saying i want to do it
sw2289A-ms98-a-0017 137.722125 150.722750 but i don't get a lot of magazines i don't get a i don't buy the newspaper but i do have a lot of uh my trash has a lot of tin cans and a lot of car[dboard]- a lot of different papers and cardboards
sw2289A-ms98-a-0018 150.722750 152.243750 [silence]
sw2289A-ms98-a-0019 152.243750 165.177000 yes but we have a bottle return a lot of the northern states and a lot of the eastern states have bottles we've had five cent uh deposits on our bottles for years 
sw2289A-ms98-a-0020 165.177000 169.990750 [silence]
sw2289A-ms98-a-0021 169.990750 184.728375 oh they should definitely get um the nickel returnable it's great for the kids because see a lot of the kids get the money from it and it's great for the boy scouts running around they knock door to door and the collect the bottles sometimes
sw2289A-ms98-a-0022 184.728375 189.758875 [silence]
sw2289A-ms98-a-0023 189.758875 191.530875 [laughter]
sw2289A-ms98-a-0024 191.530875 203.979875 [silence]
sw2289A-ms98-a-0025 203.979875 205.732375 yeah
sw2289A-ms98-a-0026 205.732375 222.337250 [silence]
sw2289A-ms98-a-0027 222.337250 224.645250 and recycle
sw2289A-ms98-a-0028 224.645250 226.009625 [silence]
sw2289A-ms98-a-0029 226.009625 229.751625 uh uh yeah [laughter-i] [laughter-see] [laughter-that]
sw2289A-ms98-a-0030 229.751625 237.285875 [silence]
sw2289A-ms98-a-0031 237.285875 243.485750 but it takes away employment from the resource that its using
sw2289A-ms98-a-0032 243.485750 245.755000 i do too
sw2289A-ms98-a-0033 245.755000 251.701250 [silence]
sw2289A-ms98-a-0034 251.701250 255.991000 uh they don't either [laughter]
sw2289A-ms98-a-0035 255.991000 261.982000 yeah like i say it's not a very controversial thing everyone thinks we should do it
sw2289A-ms98-a-0036 261.982000 272.743000 it's just that we're so lazy i mean like personally i don't want to clean my i just have can cat food i don't want to clean the can and take the label off it and put it in a separate bin
sw2289A-ms98-a-0037 272.743000 277.051125 you know i'd just rather get rid of that thing and throw it in the trash
sw2289A-ms98-a-0038 277.051125 289.495375 [silence]
sw2289A-ms98-a-0039 289.495375 294.499625 well i think i- i would be like when i bring my bottles back
sw2289A-ms98-a-0040 294.499625 303.312250 um if if if they're pretty clean and stuff so they can sit in my cellar for a couple of months and i get a whole bunch of them_1 and bring them_1 over and bring them_1 over
sw2289A-ms98-a-0041 303.312250 312.942750 now if i had a recycling center and i kept it clean like if you said wash all the cans and things i wouldn't mind if it sat around too much but if
sw2289A-ms98-a-0042 312.942750 321.998500 if it stunk or something i wouldn't like doing it but um i produce quite a bit of trash my you know house
sw2289A-ms98-a-0043 321.998500 334.990625 and i see it but i don't see so much that i can recycle like i say it's a lot of different type paper and cardboard i'm not a real plastic person user but a lot of paper
sw2289A-ms98-a-0044 334.990625 348.998500 um pretty much and i and i don't know how they sort that but if if i used a lot of can goods and i do use a lot of laundry detergent and a lot of plastic bottles i would think that i wou[ld]- i would have a recycling center
sw2289A-ms98-a-0045 348.998500 354.731000 but now it's just me and my husband so i don't know
sw2289A-ms98-a-0046 354.731000 369.337875 yeah i know what you're saying like well we have it at work we have a very aggressive recycling at work and i'm the one who will pick the newspaper out of the trash and bring it to the recycle bin see some people the recycle bin is on their way out
sw2289A-ms98-a-0047 369.337875 375.197375 instead of carrying your newspapers when they get done with them_1 at the end of the day they throw them_1 in the trash
sw2289A-ms98-a-0048 375.197375 376.761375 [silence]
sw2289A-ms98-a-0049 376.761375 383.997625 um no we don't but other other offices do they have a box for papers
sw2289A-ms98-a-0050 383.997625 406.238125 [silence]
sw2289A-ms98-a-0051 406.238125 407.990750 yeah
sw2289A-ms98-a-0052 407.990750 416.264375 [silence]
sw2289A-ms98-a-0053 416.264375 417.488500 oh
sw2289A-ms98-a-0054 417.488500 429.758000 [silence]
sw2289A-ms98-a-0055 429.758000 439.721250 well that's that's a really good idea because um like our uh frui[t]- fruit juices for some reason when they're in a can don't come with a deposit it
sw2289A-ms98-a-0056 439.721250 443.974250 th[ey're]- they're thinking about putting a deposit on them_1 because pretty much
sw2289A-ms98-a-0057 443.974250 453.987375 you have to you're having a whole separate recyclable bin just for these fruit cans where they're so much easier just to put a deposit on it because_1 most
sw2289A-ms98-a-0058 453.987375 464.210500 probably ninety percent of the aluminum cans do have deposits because_1 they're beer and soda but when they sell juice it's some strange quirk in the law you don't have to have
sw2289A-ms98-a-0059 464.210500 476.441375 a deposit on it and even like the you know a very fine juice jar does not have to have a deposit on it but if it's got soda in it it does so it's a strange
sw2289A-ms98-a-0060 476.441375 487.941000 yeah they should they should clean clear that up it wouldn't take them much to put a stamp on uh on the uh juice cans as easily as the soda
sw2289A-ms98-a-0061 487.941000 500.206875 so but redemption centers are a big thing up here they get a penny a can they handle they give you five cents and the when they return the can to the distributor i think they either get a penny or two pennies a can
sw2289A-ms98-a-0062 500.206875 503.205500 [silence]
sw2289A-ms98-a-0063 503.205500 504.664000 yeah
sw2289A-ms98-a-0064 504.664000 513.242625 [silence]
sw2289A-ms98-a-0065 513.242625 517.477125 is bott[le]- is bottle return down there a heated debate
sw2289A-ms98-a-0066 517.477125 525.498375 [silence]
sw2289A-ms98-a-0067 525.498375 527.999500 oh yeah [laughter]
sw2289A-ms98-a-0068 527.999500 529.989375 [silence]
sw2289A-ms98-a-0069 529.989375 534.486125 well we w[ell]- w[ell]- well here you can't can't drink [laughter] 
sw2289A-ms98-a-0070 534.486125 539.014250 [silence]
sw2289A-ms98-a-0071 539.014250 540.710375 well
sw2289A-ms98-a-0072 540.710375 542.281250 [silence]
sw2289A-ms98-a-0073 542.281250 553.735000 yes well i know i was in Atlanta and you could walk out the bar with your drink in your hand but here let me put that in a paper cup for you [laughter] so that was strange but
sw2289A-ms98-a-0074 553.735000 560.203125 i think if some people they have they say well we're not going to start a can deposit because_1 you have to get all these
sw2289A-ms98-a-0075 560.203125 572.998750 um [noise] uh the the recycle center you have to deal with the can and then you have to to recycle it and [vocalized-noise] their problem's already solved because they can just come to states that do have bottle deposits 
sw2289A-ms98-a-0076 572.998750 584.927000 see how they handle it and see if it's a good way and then do it that way because as i like to say [vocalized-noise] people are making money on it the cans do are worth something 
sw2289A-ms98-a-0077 584.927000 599.540000 [silence]
