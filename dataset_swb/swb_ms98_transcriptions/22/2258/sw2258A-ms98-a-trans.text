sw2258A-ms98-a-0051 202.753750 211.038375 yeah i recall a {snirtstorm} out there one day where about this time of year that there was a big cold front coming in and they got the dirt up in the air and then it snowed a little bit
sw2258A-ms98-a-0052 211.038375 212.745125 and uh
sw2258A-ms98-a-0053 212.745125 218.195000 i can imagine that happening more in Amarillo than i could in Lubbock but still anywhere out there it could happen
sw2258A-ms98-a-0054 218.195000 219.286125 [silence]
sw2258A-ms98-a-0055 219.286125 227.257750 yeah i we like i said i grew up in New Mexico we lived in Albuque[rque]- Karen and i both lived in Albuquerque for quite a long time and then i went to work for TI here
sw2258A-ms98-a-0056 227.257750 232.621750 and i came here in sixty nine and then seventy two they opened or seventy three they opened up that plant out there in Lubbock
sw2258A-ms98-a-0057 232.621750 240.473125 and uh man that was like going home and uh so we went out there were there for about ten years until that all folded up out there
sw2258A-ms98-a-0058 240.473125 243.035500 ended up coming back but uh
sw2258A-ms98-a-0059 243.035500 249.998375 yeah the weather out there was uh-huh it it could get a little bit a little bit interesting now and again

sw2258A-ms98-a-0063 257.717625 267.667250 well if you've been here for three years you didn't get here the year they had the big freeze and stuff here did you what was that eighty eighty four
sw2258A-ms98-a-0064 267.667250 270.313000 oh wow that would have been six or seven years ago then
sw2258A-ms98-a-0065 270.313000 277.878625 [silence]
sw2258A-ms98-a-0066 277.878625 279.316875 um-hum

sw2258A-ms98-a-0069 286.907250 288.880375 well the uh
sw2258A-ms98-a-0070 288.880375 294.458500 was it i guess it was three years ago that they had the real right before was it right before Christmas or
sw2258A-ms98-a-0071 294.458500 296.177125 where
sw2258A-ms98-a-0072 296.177125 300.335625 y[eah]- yeah got down to around zero somewhere and then warmed back up and killed everything off
sw2258A-ms98-a-0073 300.335625 309.334125 yeah that was that was bad news we're still try i set out a whole bunch of crepe myrtles and stuff and of course it killed them_1
sw2258A-ms98-a-0074 309.334125 312.929625 well they all come back from from the bottom
sw2258A-ms98-a-0075 312.929625 322.102500 so i'm getting kind of convinced that if something doesn't grow naturally here there's no sense in planting it because eventually you're going to lose it
sw2258A-ms98-a-0076 322.102500 327.199000 and you noticed all the pretty little trees that are out everything now the native trees
sw2258A-ms98-a-0077 327.199000 328.504375 [laughter]
sw2258A-ms98-a-0078 328.504375 332.617250 they're they know better [laughter] they know better [laughter] yeah

sw2258A-ms98-a-0090 361.976875 368.478250 well we moved into this house it was a year old and the landscaping was {semi-in} but there was still a lot more to do
sw2258A-ms98-a-0091 368.478250 376.112625 and one of the things that uh well they were really selling everybody on back then was this Indian Hawthorne boy you know that's the best stuff in the world
sw2258A-ms98-a-0092 376.112625 381.380375 well [noise] i am somewhat less than enthused about that i've got some out here that's
sw2258A-ms98-a-0093 381.380375 385.818875 five six years old now and still doesn't look a whole lot different than the day that i put it in
sw2258A-ms98-a-0094 385.818875 394.907375 and then and i noticed that a lot of the garden well you know that Indian Hawthorne that didn't work out quite as well as we thought you know so now they're pushing something else 
sw2258A-ms98-a-0095 394.907375 396.223625 yeah [laughter]

sw2258A-ms98-a-0098 398.483000 405.016375 well anyway uh [laughter-like] [laughter-i] [laughter-said] if it if it doesn't grow out in the woods here somewhere i'm not [laughter-sure]
sw2258A-ms98-a-0099 405.016375 407.805625 [vocalized-noise] plant yeah 
sw2258A-ms98-a-0100 407.805625 410.388625 this uh photinia
sw2258A-ms98-a-0101 410.388625 412.966750 the red tipped photinia
sw2258A-ms98-a-0102 412.966750 416.667750 it seems to do pretty good we've got some here that's really taken off
sw2258A-ms98-a-0103 416.667750 420.828250 [silence]
sw2258A-ms98-a-0104 420.828250 421.900750 um-hum

sw2258A-ms98-a-0106 426.297625 434.991750 that and uh the little dwarf yaupon hollies you know they they seem to or just yaupons period seem to do all right
sw2258A-ms98-a-0107 434.991750 438.888125 we've got a couple of Live Oaks in the front yard and of course they're
sw2258A-ms98-a-0108 438.888125 443.955000 they weren't native to this particular spot but they seem to have done pretty good and
sw2258A-ms98-a-0109 443.955000 445.015500 [silence]
sw2258A-ms98-a-0110 445.015500 446.098875 and uh

sw2258A-ms98-a-0112 447.947500 453.902500 yeah it's it's it's a strange one it will kind of scare you if you don't know what it's doing because_1 right now is when it's dropping it's leaves
sw2258A-ms98-a-0113 453.902500 459.254000 and you go out there and look at your tree after a good windstorm and the thing is bare and you think oh no
sw2258A-ms98-a-0114 459.254000 467.892500 but you look look real close and there's all the little new leaves getting ready to come out so it holds it's leaves all winter then loses them in the spring
sw2258A-ms98-a-0115 467.892500 470.050750 that and that red what is it red oak
sw2258A-ms98-a-0116 470.050750 472.765875 we're thinking about putting one of those in
sw2258A-ms98-a-0117 472.765875 474.871500 [silence]
sw2258A-ms98-a-0118 474.871500 476.455375 uh-huh
sw2258A-ms98-a-0119 476.455375 484.658500 well you know i heard something about that here whether Neil uh here again it may have been Neil Sperry they say you know everybody looks at these oaks and says yeah they grow slow and all that
sw2258A-ms98-a-0120 484.658500 492.387125 but most of the time that's the way that the native ones grow because they don't get the water they don't get the they're they're growing under bad conditions
sw2258A-ms98-a-0121 492.387125 499.057375 and uh if you bring one in and put it under good conditions they'll grow about as fast as any tree
sw2258A-ms98-a-0122 499.057375 501.343875 so yeah
sw2258A-ms98-a-0123 501.343875 506.201125 so anyway that's that was i guess he was talking about some of the other kinds of oaks i don't know
sw2258A-ms98-a-0124 506.201125 511.977500 whether the live uh live oaks is not really an oak i guess it's something [vocalized-noise] 
sw2258A-ms98-a-0125 511.977500 513.614750 oh
sw2258A-ms98-a-0126 513.614750 519.630750 yeah it just got the the name of being an oak because_1 it's got a kind of an acorn kind of thing on it
sw2258A-ms98-a-0127 519.630750 525.257250 but uh i think the real honest to gosh oaks like the what bur oaks and
sw2258A-ms98-a-0128 525.257250 531.955875 pin oaks and red oaks and all that sort of thing they they'll grow a lot faster
sw2258A-ms98-a-0129 531.955875 536.017750 well i guess we were supposed to be talking about the weather but that's [laughter]

sw2258A-ms98-a-0143 566.534750 575.068500 [laughter] you know you'd think that this crazy system if you're going to talk about something about the weather they'd have tried to plug you in with plug you in to somebody
sw2258A-ms98-a-0144 575.068500 578.604250 [laughter-like] [laughter-you] [laughter-know] [laughter] New York or something yeah
sw2258A-ms98-a-0145 578.604250 581.422875 yeah weather difference between east and west Plano
sw2258A-ms98-a-0146 581.422875 583.854625 [laughter]

sw2258A-ms98-a-0149 586.561625 593.495625 well when we lived in Albuquerque there was such a elevation difference there that there was a weather difference between the valley and the heights
sw2258A-ms98-a-0150 593.495625 597.898750 you know it would be snowing up in our area and then the sun would be shining and it would be hot down in the
sw2258A-ms98-a-0151 597.898750 600.993500 downtown but uh that's not the way Plano works
