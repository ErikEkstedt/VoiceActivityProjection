sw2268A-ms98-a-0010 41.842000 46.406875 and so i thought fish came out of the ocean

sw2268A-ms98-a-0012 47.430125 50.517125 and anything that was fresh water was muddy
sw2268A-ms98-a-0013 50.517125 56.435750 so i didn't learn to fish in a lake until i was well into my twenties
sw2268A-ms98-a-0014 56.435750 64.351250 so i had i had always been a a sea fisher type which is a lot of fun
sw2268A-ms98-a-0015 64.351250 69.573750 there's so many different ways to catch fish you know at night you can
sw2268A-ms98-a-0016 69.573750 76.912125 go walking in the shallows and gig flounder and things like that which isn't technically fishing but it's a lot of fun
sw2268A-ms98-a-0017 76.912125 79.705875 so i- i grew up fishing
sw2268A-ms98-a-0018 79.705875 81.847875 what area lakes do you like

sw2268A-ms98-a-0028 147.955875 153.092000 i would love to do that but they have snakes over there
sw2268A-ms98-a-0029 153.092000 155.257750 and i'm not too
sw2268A-ms98-a-0030 155.257750 159.581625 welcome around i don't i really don't want to share a boat with a snake
sw2268A-ms98-a-0031 159.581625 162.565125 i just i- i i don't see it
sw2268A-ms98-a-0032 162.565125 168.458500 i just i don't i think that i perhaps would let them have the boat or something i'd make some quick arrangements
sw2268A-ms98-a-0033 168.458500 171.615625 and i've heard so many stories about the snakes
sw2268A-ms98-a-0034 171.615625 177.016250 you know when they pull in there's a snake instead of a fish and things like that that i'm just
sw2268A-ms98-a-0035 177.016250 180.746500 i don't know what's the largest fish you ever caught
sw2268A-ms98-a-0036 180.746500 196.792125 [silence]

sw2268A-ms98-a-0042 211.646250 213.425250 i've i've seen it
sw2268A-ms98-a-0043 213.425250 217.516375 uh and and i have no problem going out in a boat uh
sw2268A-ms98-a-0044 217.516375 222.851750 it's just so dreadfully expensive and there's just so many other ways you know when you live down there
sw2268A-ms98-a-0045 222.851750 224.364125 it's not a treat
sw2268A-ms98-a-0046 224.364125 227.874000 it's what you do every day you know
sw2268A-ms98-a-0047 227.874000 230.893500 uh one of my favorite things
sw2268A-ms98-a-0048 230.893500 235.567750 was we were forever catching crab and steaming them
sw2268A-ms98-a-0049 235.567750 238.618125 you know out on the on the beach
sw2268A-ms98-a-0050 238.618125 241.830000 and you know just uh pitching them out on uh
sw2268A-ms98-a-0051 241.830000 243.436000 on uh
sw2268A-ms98-a-0052 243.436000 245.271875 what am i trying to say newspaper
sw2268A-ms98-a-0053 245.271875 252.621125 and and breaking them up and sitting out there and eating them and then digging a hole and pitching the whole thing in it you know and and that's it
sw2268A-ms98-a-0054 252.621125 257.075875 and uh the the other little creatures would take care of what was left
sw2268A-ms98-a-0055 257.075875 263.371750 so going out on a boat never did appeal to me simply because it you know there was so much else to do
