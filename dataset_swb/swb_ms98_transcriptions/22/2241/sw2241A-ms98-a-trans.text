sw2241A-ms98-a-0050 224.363125 228.499750 it it's amazing we also have roses and i mean they just grow so beautifully
sw2241A-ms98-a-0051 228.499750 232.135625 [silence]
sw2241A-ms98-a-0052 232.135625 234.750500 um what um what type roses

sw2241A-ms98-a-0056 248.971250 255.846750 i don't know i think it's i think it only has about five or six more years to go because it's a it's a really old bush and
sw2241A-ms98-a-0057 255.846750 262.733500 but i- i i'm i'm amazed because the sun is so intense and the roses just seem to survive just fine there
sw2241A-ms98-a-0058 262.733500 270.710625 [silence]
sw2241A-ms98-a-0059 270.710625 271.717625 um-hum

sw2241A-ms98-a-0067 297.931875 301.580000 yeah just if you want a lot of you know light for underneath
sw2241A-ms98-a-0068 301.580000 310.111125 that may be the all right because we had because we have some we have some old fruit trees we have a plum that's just about ready to go so we may just be
sw2241A-ms98-a-0069 310.111125 318.289125 getting rid of that but but our peaches they they seem to be doing just fine but they they really need pruning it it just seems like they that
sw2241A-ms98-a-0070 318.289125 323.564250 that even you know pruning once a year is really not enough but the the way they behave
sw2241A-ms98-a-0071 323.564250 324.593625 [silence]
sw2241A-ms98-a-0072 324.593625 326.013875 i don't know

sw2241A-ms98-a-0074 327.138125 330.925000 but uh what kind of uh what kind of what kind of grass are you growing
sw2241A-ms98-a-0075 330.925000 332.134250 [silence]
sw2241A-ms98-a-0076 332.134250 333.592000 bermuda
sw2241A-ms98-a-0077 333.592000 334.895250 yeah
sw2241A-ms98-a-0078 334.895250 340.064750 oh i've i've been trying uh uh a mixture of uh the bermuda and the rye
sw2241A-ms98-a-0079 340.064750 344.594875 and but i may be working like a fescue in because of you know the type of weather
sw2241A-ms98-a-0080 344.594875 351.564750 it seems that uh bermuda's bermuda's fine but um it looks like it would hold the soil but it really doesn't
sw2241A-ms98-a-0081 351.564750 356.253250 a lot of a lot silt that comes in it just doesn't seem to hold it very well
sw2241A-ms98-a-0082 356.253250 360.646250 but uh but the rye does really well especially during the wintertime
sw2241A-ms98-a-0083 360.646250 367.800625 but uh but boy once it gets over seventy seventy five degrees that it just dries up shrivels up and dies
sw2241A-ms98-a-0084 367.800625 369.571000 [silence]
sw2241A-ms98-a-0085 369.571000 370.450125 but

sw2241A-ms98-a-0087 375.309375 376.022750 yeah 
sw2241A-ms98-a-0088 376.022750 381.659000 my my parents-in-law they're they're building a house into the side of a hill um well it's already been built and everything
sw2241A-ms98-a-0089 381.659000 389.097875 they've been living there for about three months now but uh this is out in west Texas but the the wind there has been so bad that
sw2241A-ms98-a-0090 389.097875 397.003875 i- i mean they've tried to plant grass and they just [laughter-have] [laughter-some] [laughter-problems] big time problems they just they just washing uh
sw2241A-ms98-a-0091 397.003875 400.079625 watching their lawn just blow away [laughter-oh] [laughter-yeah]
sw2241A-ms98-a-0092 400.079625 401.704000 [silence]
sw2241A-ms98-a-0093 401.704000 402.913375 but it's
sw2241A-ms98-a-0094 402.913375 407.821000 but it's quite an undertaking they have about two or three acres of land on lake front property
sw2241A-ms98-a-0095 407.821000 411.402250 on a on the side of a hill it's beautiful i mean you can see the house from
sw2241A-ms98-a-0096 411.402250 414.729625 you know miles away but it's you know
sw2241A-ms98-a-0097 414.729625 419.256625 it's a pretty neat little job but they save a lot of they save a lot of energy but
sw2241A-ms98-a-0098 419.256625 426.385000 just uh you know for them i mean they they're going to have to start gardening it's going to be from the ground up
sw2241A-ms98-a-0099 426.385000 428.422500 i mean the whole way
sw2241A-ms98-a-0100 428.422500 433.435875 and they said well we just plan on spending the rest of our lives just [laughter-getting] [laughter-this] property developed
sw2241A-ms98-a-0101 433.435875 435.124875 [laughter]
sw2241A-ms98-a-0102 435.124875 440.547375 it's amazing i mean they have have the all they have are mes[quite]- uh mesquite and cottonwoods
sw2241A-ms98-a-0103 440.547375 447.432500 and uh it's it's all on Lake Greenbelt that property out there and uh
sw2241A-ms98-a-0104 447.432500 456.306000 i don't know that what they have they have all the water they want they can they can actually they can pump water i mean they have to get permission but they can pump water up from the shore
sw2241A-ms98-a-0105 456.306000 457.434500 but uh
sw2241A-ms98-a-0106 457.434500 461.371625 that's for like an additional they have to pay like some kind of fee per year
sw2241A-ms98-a-0107 461.371625 463.283375 but uh
sw2241A-ms98-a-0108 463.283375 469.424750 they're uh right now though i think they're just [laughter-they're] trying to get the trees planted and everything
sw2241A-ms98-a-0109 469.424750 474.831000 but man i- i just think of all of the money that they that they're going to have to spend just getting that
sw2241A-ms98-a-0110 474.831000 481.905000 but the taxes alone there Lake Greenbelt and some places they they they really they over tax
sw2241A-ms98-a-0111 481.905000 485.406500 and i mean your talking what just several hundred dollars a year in property taxes
sw2241A-ms98-a-0112 485.406500 487.386375 it's it's it's ridiculous
sw2241A-ms98-a-0113 487.386375 491.023000 [silence]
sw2241A-ms98-a-0114 491.023000 497.978750 yeah no no it's not it's because even though it's far out there it's just that Lake Greenbelt you know they have to
sw2241A-ms98-a-0115 497.978750 502.764375 they they try to do it just from the selling the water but um
sw2241A-ms98-a-0116 502.764375 508.532625 the water usage you know they try to limit even though there's three or four streams that flow into it
sw2241A-ms98-a-0117 508.532625 514.461375 people still use it enough in like in towns like Clarendon and other areas that where they irrigate
sw2241A-ms98-a-0118 514.461375 523.976125 they [laughter-huh] they they still haven't gotten used to the dry land farming but the irr[igation]- irrigation because it's gotten so bad the past few years
sw2241A-ms98-a-0119 523.976125 525.402250 but
sw2241A-ms98-a-0120 525.402250 531.701000 i don't know i just came back from there and just the air is so dry i don't see how anything can survive out there
sw2241A-ms98-a-0121 531.701000 537.665250 [laughter] for long periods of time should say my father-in-law says the mesquite trees is are
sw2241A-ms98-a-0122 537.665250 545.357750 they're they're they're pretty smart they're smart they're about the smartest tree around they don't they don't even start growing until May may or April
sw2241A-ms98-a-0123 545.357750 553.546250 like after it's been raining for a few months they say the roots have developed so that's all they work on just a leafy they don't do anything
sw2241A-ms98-a-0124 553.546250 559.566625 [silence]
sw2241A-ms98-a-0125 559.566625 560.571500 um-hum
sw2241A-ms98-a-0126 560.571500 576.892750 [silence]
sw2241A-ms98-a-0127 576.892750 579.852875 i- i know my my wife and i we planted on the
sw2241A-ms98-a-0128 579.852875 587.152125 on the south side of our of our house we planted some gardenias and they did real fine during the summertime it's just
sw2241A-ms98-a-0129 587.152125 594.760750 but during the fall when it stopped when uh the rain let off just a little bit it i mean it just dried up
sw2241A-ms98-a-0130 594.760750 599.592000 and uh so i guess it these plants they just they don't it's like they remain
