sw2241B-ms98-a-0027 114.725625 122.896250 yeah we've we've got mayb[e]- maybe eight to eight inches to a foot of soil and then it's solid rock from then on down so [laughter]
sw2241B-ms98-a-0028 122.896250 128.784875 yeah it's uh a little aggravating [laughter-we] can't we can't put in anything too big
sw2241B-ms98-a-0029 128.784875 136.057750 um as far as uh shrubs and things like that because_1 they've got to get a chance to find the find the cracks in the rock
sw2241B-ms98-a-0030 136.057750 137.629375 but uh

sw2241B-ms98-a-0035 150.624250 160.584125 a uh major undertaking i guess uh sprinkler systems or anything uh start to get real expensive because there's an awful lot of work that has to be done chopping through the rock
sw2241B-ms98-a-0036 160.584125 162.058500 [silence]
sw2241B-ms98-a-0037 162.058500 165.658500 but uh and it you know [laughter-no[t]-] not even
sw2241B-ms98-a-0038 165.658500 172.219250 consider considering a pool or anything like that that's that's practically has to be blasted in i guess
sw2241B-ms98-a-0039 172.219250 180.994000 but uh and it makes it makes for a a different challenge i've never well i- i moved to Dallas about five years ago and uh

sw2241B-ms98-a-0042 198.014625 202.771500 and the first thing the the old guy there at the stand asked is what part of town we lived in
sw2241B-ms98-a-0043 202.771500 207.343750 because_1 he said uh i've got i've got a dozen different varieties and
