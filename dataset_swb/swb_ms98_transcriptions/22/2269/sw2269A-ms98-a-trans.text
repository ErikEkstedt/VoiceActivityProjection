sw2269A-ms98-a-0002 0.190000 7.913500 camping uh is a pretty vague term it seems to encounter or cover a lot of different kinds of
sw2269A-ms98-a-0003 7.913500 19.248500 of uh shall we say over night trips or sometimes not even over night uh anything from no provisions to uh going with what you can carry on a backpack uh maybe even a tent
sw2269A-ms98-a-0004 19.248500 33.064000 go up to uh state parks with six shelters and little screened in areas and then travel trailers and all the way up to conference center type campings that have uh you know air conditioning like hotels with uh 
sw2269A-ms98-a-0005 33.064000 47.176000 uh ski boats and whatever else may be around some people uh [vocalized-noise] they they still call that a camp so i guess you could go camping and do archery and riflery and all the things that kids do at those camps but then go to their little ho[tel]- air conditioning room at night
sw2269A-ms98-a-0006 47.176000 61.299250 so uh i've been through most all of that i've not done much of the no provision survival type but i've done backpacking in tents and state park shelters and travel trailers and uh camping camping with nice air conditioned rooms
sw2269A-ms98-a-0007 61.299250 72.452875 and i guess of all the all the ones i kind of prefer the air conditioned ones and the the not so roughing ones [laughter] with more entertainment than uh survival in mind
sw2269A-ms98-a-0008 72.452875 84.233625 uh one of the times that we were at a uh state park we went up into Oklahoma and went to a place called Broken Bow and
sw2269A-ms98-a-0009 84.233625 88.748750 rented a few canoes with a church group we were with bunch of college age kids
sw2269A-ms98-a-0010 88.748750 97.762750 [noise] and we took these canoes into a river that would feed it that would bring us back down toward drove up upstream and then
sw2269A-ms98-a-0011 97.762750 101.348500 worked our way back down toward the campsite that we were at
sw2269A-ms98-a-0012 101.348500 114.013625 and you just never can time those things right with the water the way you would like them to be uh we got there and the water was really low we we ended up carrying the canoes over portions and
sw2269A-ms98-a-0013 114.013625 124.619250 at one point even though i know your not supposed to do this i stood up in the canoe and reached my paddle up as high as i could and i could not even touch the branches that were over the the
sw2269A-ms98-a-0014 124.619250 132.118250 [vocalized-noise] uh river part there and you could see debris in those branches where the water had just been a couple of weeks prior
sw2269A-ms98-a-0015 132.118250 141.917000 so it was you know ten or so feet uh higher just a few weeks ago in fact uh a few weeks prior to when we got there and the
sw2269A-ms98-a-0016 141.917000 151.140125 camp the people at the campgrounds told us that uh asked where we were from and we said Dallas and they said oh well we had a girl die just two weeks ago in that rage of water
sw2269A-ms98-a-0017 151.140125 165.296875 well that's encouraging but they said oh you have nothing to worry about you'll have the opposite problem you may die of carrying your canoe and sure enough it uh it was a little bit laborious instead of a a six to eight hours worth of canoeing we ended up only
sw2269A-ms98-a-0018 165.296875 177.828000 surviving about uh half the trip and it took us us about ten hours so we we got in our car half way and and went and got the rest of the vehicles and brought them up stream and
sw2269A-ms98-a-0019 177.828000 191.355500 loaded it all back up and went back to the campsite exhausted but uh i have had better camping canoeing trips uh as it were uh like the Guadalupe down in South Texas it's got some real nice uh
sw2269A-ms98-a-0020 191.355500 196.956000 canoeing uh water in it have you been camping much
sw2269A-ms98-a-0021 196.956000 202.446750 [silence]
sw2269A-ms98-a-0022 202.446750 203.476500 um-hum

sw2269A-ms98-a-0024 208.019750 210.875750 [laughter] that's true

sw2269A-ms98-a-0026 235.577500 236.773375 hum

sw2269A-ms98-a-0030 249.437250 251.300625 yeah
sw2269A-ms98-a-0031 251.300625 256.028250 i wonder if uh being from uh
sw2269A-ms98-a-0032 256.028250 265.738750 Dallas area i- i wonder if if it's just this area that's doesn't encourage that type of camping i- i seems like back packing goes well with
sw2269A-ms98-a-0033 265.738750 276.670125 mountain and sce[neries]- sceneries worth seeing by foot where as here your looking as you know you can go two hundred miles and your probably in the same kind of environment you [laughter-were] in when you left so
sw2269A-ms98-a-0034 276.670125 282.402000 uh unless you go over toward East Texas where there's a co[nsiderable]- considerable amount of woods or if you go
sw2269A-ms98-a-0035 282.402000 297.014875 uh extreme south part where there's some some things worth seeing by foot uh the majority of of camping experiences around here seem to be geared toward entertainment where you're you're looking at the state parks all seem to have something of a
sw2269A-ms98-a-0036 297.014875 303.949625 a either a lake that you'd go canoeing or skiing or whatever kind of sailing boating you want to do uh
sw2269A-ms98-a-0037 303.949625 314.575125 but there's not a whole lot of trails built in a lot of state parks there are in more of the the eastern part of the state where there's woods worth worth seeing but uh that's interesting i hadn't
sw2269A-ms98-a-0038 314.575125 323.683500 all the people that i know that do back packing usually go up to Colorado or go up somewhere and you know get away from the state to actually do that kind of uh camping
sw2269A-ms98-a-0039 323.683500 351.921250 [silence]
sw2269A-ms98-a-0040 351.921250 353.472625 that's not too bad
sw2269A-ms98-a-0041 353.472625 354.700375 [silence]
sw2269A-ms98-a-0042 354.700375 356.061375 that's not too bad at all

sw2269A-ms98-a-0048 380.120875 407.864250 [silence]
sw2269A-ms98-a-0049 407.864250 409.246750 huh
sw2269A-ms98-a-0050 409.246750 418.995625 yeah that would be one of my very first experiences of uh tent camping if it were with a group of people we went up to a state park that was
sw2269A-ms98-a-0051 418.995625 422.443250 oh the campsites were uh
sw2269A-ms98-a-0052 422.443250 431.721000 not perfect but they were you know basic rail road ties and laid in sand so it wasn't just the actual terrain and it had a somewhat level and it had a place to stick your tent and some
sw2269A-ms98-a-0053 431.721000 438.381500 you could uh drive a stake in fairly easy and and get the thing nailed down but that's usually a little windy on a lake edge
sw2269A-ms98-a-0054 438.381500 452.425875 and uh the very first time we went up there with this group of people we all set up these tents most of which were borrowed and we were having to figure out you know how this particular one works and how this one works and it's eleven o'clock at night and it's you know your doing it by the head lights of the cars and 
sw2269A-ms98-a-0055 452.425875 464.626875 and about uh oh a little after midnight we got all these tents set up and i laid down inside one of them and was just about asleep when a little voice from outside the tent said uh asked if i was doing all right and i said
sw2269A-ms98-a-0056 464.626875 469.054875 huh yeah yeah do[ing]- doing just fine you know it's a little windy but i'm doing all right and
sw2269A-ms98-a-0057 469.054875 479.780750 and they suggested that i come out that mine was the only tent that hadn't fallen down yet and sure enough after i got out of there a little bit it blew down and the winds were just terrible and uh
sw2269A-ms98-a-0058 479.780750 489.079500 then it started to rain so we didn't get too wet but uh it rained just for a little bit then went on and so after all that was over we put them all back up and
sw2269A-ms98-a-0059 489.079500 499.312500 woke up a little late the next morning but uh when we finally got back from that that outing one of the uh parents of one of the kids had asked how it went and said that he was listening to the
sw2269A-ms98-a-0060 499.312500 511.010875 the radio and they clocked a ninety seven mile an hour winds on the dam right in front of that lake and there's really nothing to stop it it's uh thirty or forty miles wide it's a huge uh
sw2269A-ms98-a-0061 511.010875 514.332500 lake right on the border of Texas and Oklahoma there and
sw2269A-ms98-a-0062 514.332500 528.298000 and it had a the little little part that we were on was the peninsula with no trees so we were just stuck out in the water with uh nothing blocking us from this wind it's a wonder we didn't lose a lot more than that but uh i'm sure that was just uh 
sw2269A-ms98-a-0063 528.298000 533.137250 the top speed of the wind but it it did manage to take all our tents out
sw2269A-ms98-a-0064 533.137250 545.639250 [silence]
sw2269A-ms98-a-0065 545.639250 549.048250 [laughter]

sw2269A-ms98-a-0067 552.549750 555.229875 yeah yeah
sw2269A-ms98-a-0068 555.229875 562.360750 [silence]
sw2269A-ms98-a-0069 562.360750 564.124500 yeah that's for sure
sw2269A-ms98-a-0070 564.124500 568.218500 [silence]
sw2269A-ms98-a-0071 568.218500 569.155000 yep
sw2269A-ms98-a-0072 569.155000 571.553750 [silence]
sw2269A-ms98-a-0073 571.553750 572.735750 that's true
sw2269A-ms98-a-0074 572.735750 576.562250 on that same lake there's another portion of it that's uh
sw2269A-ms98-a-0075 576.562250 580.637500 real uh carved out the the the
sw2269A-ms98-a-0076 580.637500 582.996625 sh[oreline]- shoreline is
sw2269A-ms98-a-0077 582.996625 588.011875 uh up against rock and it's it's pretty far cliff i'd say shirt or forty feet worth
sw2269A-ms98-a-0078 588.011875 597.471375 and the campsites are up top and then you go down and there's a little path where the little rail road ties again will try to stop the erosion on the path and little stair steps all the way down to this beach
sw2269A-ms98-a-0079 597.471375 600.570750 and that was uh a that particular campout
