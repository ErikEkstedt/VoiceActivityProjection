sw2287A-ms98-a-0014 49.549375 53.235000 yeah or sometimes they don't like either of the choices
sw2287A-ms98-a-0015 53.235000 57.468250 for the candidates so they think well you know why vote
sw2287A-ms98-a-0016 57.468250 59.142125 [silence]
sw2287A-ms98-a-0017 59.142125 64.271500 yeah really especially in Texas [laughter]

sw2287A-ms98-a-0026 97.180000 105.165500 yeah it also seems like maybe a[nother]- another candidate that nobody wants could slip in if you know not enough people are voting
sw2287A-ms98-a-0027 105.165500 114.644750 [silence]
sw2287A-ms98-a-0028 114.644750 124.323500 yeah it's kind of like in Louisiana where that uh guy that's like a Ku Klux Klan member something got elected [laughter] kind of scary when you think about that
sw2287A-ms98-a-0029 124.323500 145.667875 [silence]
sw2287A-ms98-a-0030 145.667875 148.721250 oh gosh [laughter]

sw2287A-ms98-a-0033 151.488500 157.995125 yeah people'll will sit home and assume oh that guy would never get elected next thing you know you've got him [laughter]

sw2287A-ms98-a-0045 192.723750 201.580500 yeah i think one thing that maybe would help people vote is if the polls were either open more days or you could mail it in or
sw2287A-ms98-a-0046 201.580500 212.801125 something like if you have if you have real strict work hours and you can only go like at seven in the morning or after work and you have to stand in line for so long i think that discourages a lot of people
sw2287A-ms98-a-0047 212.801125 216.300125 [silence]
sw2287A-ms98-a-0048 216.300125 217.753750 uh-huh

sw2287A-ms98-a-0058 259.147875 260.544750 right

sw2287A-ms98-a-0060 264.376875 272.685375 yeah i think they should change the whole system so that it's easier i thi[nk]- i think more people would do it if it wasn't such a hassle
sw2287A-ms98-a-0061 272.685375 281.206250 [silence]

sw2287A-ms98-a-0068 316.035125 323.392375 yeah that would be i usually vote a lot of times i'll vote a straight party ticket just because i don't take the time to find out what every
sw2287A-ms98-a-0069 323.392375 331.916375 you know other than the major candidates what they stand for on on what issues so i just trust well the party kind of goes along these lines so i'll go ahead and vote
sw2287A-ms98-a-0070 331.916375 333.390375 but that
sw2287A-ms98-a-0071 333.390375 344.153250 [silence]

sw2287A-ms98-a-0076 365.217000 370.809125 no i guess it'd be best if you knew what each person and [laughter] what they stood for and why and everything but
sw2287A-ms98-a-0077 370.809125 380.423750 [silence]
sw2287A-ms98-a-0078 380.423750 384.920375 right and try to determine if what you read was objective or not and

sw2287A-ms98-a-0086 403.559625 407.798875 yeah i think it could affect the outcome you know could make it unfair
sw2287A-ms98-a-0087 407.798875 425.018750 [silence]
sw2287A-ms98-a-0088 425.018750 427.008500 oh yeah
