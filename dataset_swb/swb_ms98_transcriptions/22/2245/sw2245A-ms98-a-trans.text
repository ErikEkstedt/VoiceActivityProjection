sw2245A-ms98-a-0017 45.885125 51.950750 yeah i when i watched it originally i didn't know it was a i don't know it was going to be a series i thought it was just a movie
sw2245A-ms98-a-0018 51.950750 56.917000 and so i started watching it and all of a sudden stay tuned next week and i went what
sw2245A-ms98-a-0019 56.917000 62.552125 and then it blows into this whole series thing so i sort of had to stay with it
sw2245A-ms98-a-0020 62.552125 68.060625 not really it it it's it's gotten to the point it's getting ridiculous now and
sw2245A-ms98-a-0021 68.060625 75.344125 they they just had the uh season finale and i don't i don't know what they accomplished but i think the writers just
sw2245A-ms98-a-0022 75.344125 78.112625 figure well let's just do anything and
sw2245A-ms98-a-0023 78.112625 80.973625 we'll we'll have a couple of months to come up with some new ideas
sw2245A-ms98-a-0024 80.973625 90.136375 [silence]

sw2245A-ms98-a-0028 94.727500 97.722000 yeah i don't like programs that i can figure it out
sw2245A-ms98-a-0029 97.722000 101.350000 um the only one that i watch religiously is LA Law
sw2245A-ms98-a-0030 101.350000 103.074625 i really like that
sw2245A-ms98-a-0031 103.074625 105.561625 [silence]

sw2245A-ms98-a-0036 115.040375 118.844500 i the reason i like it is because they give you good law in there
sw2245A-ms98-a-0037 118.844500 123.722375 yeah it's not like these other programs where they just make up anything they want
sw2245A-ms98-a-0038 123.722375 127.459250 and they they throw little tidbits out that are really good
sw2245A-ms98-a-0039 127.459250 130.268750 [silence]
sw2245A-ms98-a-0040 130.268750 141.526500 um-hum of course i mean it's got its bad side so it's limited by the format and obviously you don't get into court as quickly as they seem to make it out that you do i mean 
sw2245A-ms98-a-0041 141.526500 148.151375 they're they're in California and th[ey're]- they're waiting list is about four years four or five years for a civil case

sw2245A-ms98-a-0160 561.607375 563.464500 which is good i'm glad
sw2245A-ms98-a-0161 563.464500 567.306875 [silence]
sw2245A-ms98-a-0162 567.306875 568.639250 um-hum
sw2245A-ms98-a-0163 568.639250 570.381250 and then and then she
sw2245A-ms98-a-0164 570.381250 574.009500 that's right then she didn't want to do her obligation yeah
sw2245A-ms98-a-0165 574.009500 576.451375 [silence]
sw2245A-ms98-a-0166 576.451375 591.444875 well i you know i'm not i'm not racist or anything but one of my one -[a]nother one of my pet peeves is they had a lot of Black on the news talking about how unfair it is because the Blacks are poor and therefore they don't have a choice but go in the military
sw2245A-ms98-a-0167 591.444875 594.635500 so there's more of them getting killed than the Whites
sw2245A-ms98-a-0168 594.635500 597.402250 now to me that doesn't make any damn sense
sw2245A-ms98-a-0169 597.402250 599.077750 [silence]
