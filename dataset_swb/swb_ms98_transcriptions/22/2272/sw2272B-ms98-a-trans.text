sw2272B-ms98-a-0002 1.510750 5.400375 so regarding this proposal um
sw2272B-ms98-a-0003 5.400375 19.505500 personally i guess my my initial feeling is that i[t]- it would be a great experience for kids um i- i don't think that they really get that sort of experience working with the community
sw2272B-ms98-a-0004 19.505500 25.522750 through school through college i- i just don't think people have that opportunity anymore
sw2272B-ms98-a-0005 25.522750 27.716750 [silence]
sw2272B-ms98-a-0006 27.716750 42.178750 i think it would be a great way to keep kids busy so that the[y]- you know they they don't get on the wrong track um you know so that they they have someplace to go after school and they feel like they're producing um
sw2272B-ms98-a-0007 42.178750 48.999625 i mean who knows what they may be doing in their free time if they don't participate in something like this you know
sw2272B-ms98-a-0008 48.999625 51.656625 [silence]
sw2272B-ms98-a-0009 51.656625 52.977125 um-hum

sw2272B-ms98-a-0019 76.997125 79.698625 um-hum that's true
sw2272B-ms98-a-0020 79.698625 85.637250 that's true i mean it might turn people more off than on if they're forced to do something that they don't want to do
sw2272B-ms98-a-0021 85.637250 92.297625 i guess a year is a long time maybe six months might be a little bit more reasonable
sw2272B-ms98-a-0022 92.297625 102.815250 but i can see a lot of benefits in that it might uh interest some people that had never thought of maybe going into social work or
sw2272B-ms98-a-0023 102.815250 108.021250 or that sort of thing um and gosh we all know that there's a need for that

sw2272B-ms98-a-0034 137.877875 141.231375 i think it would be nice if they could
sw2272B-ms98-a-0035 141.231375 144.248375 y[ou]- almost give it as course credit
sw2272B-ms98-a-0036 144.248375 152.318750 you know um have it be just like real life teaching in a sense and maybe then uh
sw2272B-ms98-a-0037 152.318750 167.199750 people are feeling like they're getting something out of it too but that certainly everyone else would be getting something out of them participating and and i mean i i even think that that sort of experience is worth a lot more than reading a textbook sometimes

sw2272B-ms98-a-0045 191.020750 198.598000 yeah when i was in college i worked um with a group and i actually ran a Big Brother Big Sister program
sw2272B-ms98-a-0046 198.598000 200.235500 and
sw2272B-ms98-a-0047 200.235500 208.375625 besides just you know having this extracurricular thing i really noticed that it gave people a sense of commitment
sw2272B-ms98-a-0048 208.375625 216.954875 you know they learned that they need to if they make a a if they have a responsibility especially if it's dealing with another person
sw2272B-ms98-a-0049 216.954875 225.216750 you know someone else might be relying on them for something um you know depending on them to either be somewhere or take someone someplace or something like that
sw2272B-ms98-a-0050 225.216750 232.907375 you know that that you really learn to to be dependable you know you learn that when someone's relying on you you need to be there
sw2272B-ms98-a-0051 232.907375 234.915750 [silence]
sw2272B-ms98-a-0052 234.915750 237.586750 oh it's really it's true
sw2272B-ms98-a-0053 237.586750 239.066625 yeah
sw2272B-ms98-a-0054 239.066625 247.513750 well i- i work at a in a personnel agency and um i've just found the work ethics of people to be disgusting
sw2272B-ms98-a-0055 247.513750 257.649375 i mean you know i'll someone might not show up for work and you'll call them and oh they overslept or oh they just didn't feel like going to work and so i lose my job i'll get another one
sw2272B-ms98-a-0056 257.649375 258.741375 [silence]
sw2272B-ms98-a-0057 258.741375 264.151375 i- i i know i mean i wish i was lucky enough to not want to work [laughter] you know [laughter]
sw2272B-ms98-a-0058 264.151375 273.172750 but um i mean perhaps that this sort of training early in life before people develop bad habits might not be such a bad idea but
sw2272B-ms98-a-0059 273.172750 281.529375 but you know it is it is a commitment and perhaps these people would rather be doing something else just as constructive and we're making them do that
sw2272B-ms98-a-0060 281.529375 291.987375 [silence]
sw2272B-ms98-a-0061 291.987375 293.496250 yeah

sw2272B-ms98-a-0071 311.561125 316.459625 yeah it is i don't know i think it's a very interesting
sw2272B-ms98-a-0072 316.459625 324.393375 um discussion you know and and there's certainly uh lots of pros and cons around it
sw2272B-ms98-a-0073 324.393375 330.053625 um i i wish i had that sort of choice i mean maybe maybe it could end up being a choice
sw2272B-ms98-a-0074 330.053625 343.860750 and things that um you know wha[t]- the problem is that now it's seen as almost a punishment like when somebody um i don't know remember wasn't it Zsa Zsa Gabor that had to do community service work for like a year
sw2272B-ms98-a-0075 343.860750 351.703250 r[ight]- right or something like that and a lot of um y[ou]- felonies felony people you know have to do this sort of community service
sw2272B-ms98-a-0076 351.703250 359.280875 and i think it's getting the wrong sort of uh um connotation with it it shouldn't be looked at as a punishment
sw2272B-ms98-a-0077 359.280875 363.057250 it shouldn't be looked at something to do to make up for other things that you did
sw2272B-ms98-a-0078 363.057250 368.624875 i- i think it needs to be community service needs to have more of a positive
sw2272B-ms98-a-0079 368.624875 373.142750 um light towards it and have it look as something
sw2272B-ms98-a-0080 373.142750 387.021500 you know that you did because you wanted to do it because you saw the benefits out of it and not as something that you know oh you you did it instead of going to jail for three months or something like that i mean that's that's a feeling i get now and
sw2272B-ms98-a-0081 387.021500 401.748500 i i wouldn't want it i wouldn't want to be one of those people that's being taken care of somehow knowing that this person is doing it to get out of a sentence or or you know because they were bad in some other way
sw2272B-ms98-a-0082 401.748500 408.545125 [silence]
sw2272B-ms98-a-0083 408.545125 410.168750 um-hum
sw2272B-ms98-a-0084 410.168750 413.984625 but bad enough right [laughter-yeah] that's true
sw2272B-ms98-a-0085 413.984625 415.861125 [silence]
sw2272B-ms98-a-0086 415.861125 418.997375 yeah right yeah
