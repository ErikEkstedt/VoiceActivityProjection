sw2292A-ms98-a-0007 23.926625 27.385000 m[y]- uh when my husband was looking for his job was um
sw2292A-ms98-a-0008 27.385000 37.330875 hours you know we he had been in graduate school so i was used to his not being home at all [laughter] so i was you know didn't want him to have a job that
sw2292A-ms98-a-0009 37.330875 48.780250 would make him kind of be on call all the time and have to go in at any time and you know even on the weekends and and um and things so that was important to me and also insurance
sw2292A-ms98-a-0010 48.780250 59.473625 for the fa[mily]- our family because we'd like to be able to take care of our medical needs and not be thinking so much about whether or not you can afford it

sw2292A-ms98-a-0033 129.692250 143.827625 yes it's pretty bad well yeah and we um we were interested in having de[ntal]- dental insurance too because um we[ll]- having been in school we kind of put things off and only went in when we knew there was a problem somewhere and stuff and
sw2292A-ms98-a-0034 143.827625 149.992000 we wanted to be able to go in and have our teeth cleaned and just checked all over and
sw2292A-ms98-a-0035 149.992000 152.478125 [silence]
sw2292A-ms98-a-0036 152.478125 157.751625 we have um you know we're at Aetna with uh an [vocalized-noise] we have like the
sw2292A-ms98-a-0037 157.751625 165.273500 medi[cal]- the dental insurance is separate is that what you mean and i don't think it's the basic i think it's the other one
sw2292A-ms98-a-0038 165.273500 166.990375 [silence]
sw2292A-ms98-a-0039 166.990375 171.203875 um-hum uh-huh
sw2292A-ms98-a-0040 171.203875 189.798125 [silence]
sw2292A-ms98-a-0041 189.798125 197.926875 uh-huh no that's great yeah we need to go shopping for dentists and things like that too
sw2292A-ms98-a-0042 197.926875 205.594125 yes and let's see besides insurance other things that we looked at um
sw2292A-ms98-a-0043 205.594125 215.996125 well my husband does not like to commute very far and and we don't like him to be you know having to drive an hour to work or [laughter-something]
sw2292A-ms98-a-0044 215.996125 227.904750 [noise] so we kind of looked for where where the uh his office would be located and how far well he's uh you know he's at the one that's at um
sw2292A-ms98-a-0045 227.904750 237.835875 seventy five at uh six thirty five and so we[ll]- by living in Plano we're just about fifteen minutes away and
sw2292A-ms98-a-0046 237.835875 251.497375 e[specially]- especially when they finish all the construction out here and we didn't want him to let you know to like we had some job offers in the New York area and we thought well you know he would be really commuting [laughter]
sw2292A-ms98-a-0047 251.497375 259.257250 and not only is it you know trouble to have to drive but it takes time away from your home and your family when you're out driving
sw2292A-ms98-a-0048 259.257250 273.054625 and um so that was something that was important to us and because_1 l[ike]- like i say i we kind of felt deprived that he had been in school and been away from us for so [laughter-long] that we were anxious to do everything we could to have you know
sw2292A-ms98-a-0049 273.054625 280.461000 made us be more together and and what other can you think of another thing that you guys looked at and
sw2292A-ms98-a-0050 280.461000 284.983375 [silence]

sw2292A-ms98-a-0055 308.524250 319.728750 um-hum that's true that's really important um also what um opportunities there would be for advancement
sw2292A-ms98-a-0056 319.728750 327.082875 i think we looked at besides just you know what salary you would be ha[ving]- having now but when
sw2292A-ms98-a-0057 327.082875 331.705875 when could uh your salary increase and
sw2292A-ms98-a-0058 331.705875 334.870250 is there was there somewhere to go [laughter]

sw2292A-ms98-a-0062 343.496750 347.994625 yes tha[t]- that we can make our mortgage payments and
sw2292A-ms98-a-0063 347.994625 350.966500 yeah that's really true
sw2292A-ms98-a-0064 350.966500 373.321250 [silence]

sw2292A-ms98-a-0070 393.980875 399.351500 but well we also were interested in um you know being sure that he
sw2292A-ms98-a-0071 399.351500 406.935250 felt like he liked the people that he would be working with and that there would be some uh opportunity for
sw2292A-ms98-a-0072 406.935250 418.979625 for friendships that way so that you would feel happy going to work everyday and rather than thinking oh i really i can't stand these [laughter-people] [laughter-i] but uh so that's something that was important to him and
sw2292A-ms98-a-0073 418.979625 423.470250 thinking he could um work under tho[se]-
sw2292A-ms98-a-0074 423.470250 429.478375 oh just since l[ast]- last summer it's only been not even a year yet so
sw2292A-ms98-a-0075 429.478375 443.479375 [silence]
sw2292A-ms98-a-0076 443.479375 445.567750 yes we're
sw2292A-ms98-a-0077 445.567750 447.097500 [silence]
sw2292A-ms98-a-0078 447.097500 449.216750 [laughter-oh] yeah
sw2292A-ms98-a-0079 449.216750 450.394750 [silence]
sw2292A-ms98-a-0080 450.394750 454.104875 you never know we're hoping that that [laughter-won't] be the case we
sw2292A-ms98-a-0081 454.104875 460.311000 i think one of the m[ost]- one of the most deciding factors of why we chose um this area is that um
sw2292A-ms98-a-0082 460.311000 463.497000 my husband was raised in Irving
sw2292A-ms98-a-0083 463.497000 472.997000 and so he we have a lot of family here his side of the family and being when we were down in Houston we were isolated i mean it's not that far but
sw2292A-ms98-a-0084 472.997000 482.907375 people would ha[ve]- we didn't have anyone in town that was our family and although we had really good friends and and we had church and school support and things um
sw2292A-ms98-a-0085 482.907375 491.485125 we were anxious to move close to family members just because we wanted our children to know their grandparents and things like that
sw2292A-ms98-a-0086 491.485125 498.754000 so that really made a big difference i think in why we chose TI and chose to move this way
sw2292A-ms98-a-0087 498.754000 517.212375 [silence]
sw2292A-ms98-a-0088 517.212375 519.180000 um-hum

sw2292A-ms98-a-0101 550.238875 564.762250 we're really enjoying it i wonder what it would be like i mean i i wanted to be close to family but i also thought that it would be harder to be close to family [laughter] but it's turned out really good and i think that you know we're really satisfied with that choice and
sw2292A-ms98-a-0102 564.762250 571.496500 we you know kind of felt like um it was worth it to us
sw2292A-ms98-a-0103 571.496500 584.981125 but anyway [laughter] well i my children just ran out the door so i need to [laughter-go] [laughter-check] [laughter-on] [laughter-them_1] but i've really enjoyed this c[onversation]- conversation and and uh nice to have met you and you have a good day okay_1 bye-bye
