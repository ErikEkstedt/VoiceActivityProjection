sw2292B-ms98-a-0059 349.728250 364.496000 uh uh one of the drawbacks i think of working for a big company is often times you do have to follow pretty rigid um [noise] guidelines um if if an employee is especially exemplary i think it's often
sw2292B-ms98-a-0060 364.496000 374.997000 in a smaller company it's a little bit easier for them to say hey you know this person did a wonderful job give him a big bonus kind of thing a lot of times [noise]
sw2292B-ms98-a-0061 374.997000 387.979625 smaller companies have bonus plans where i think in a large company it's hard to do that because_1 there're just so many people to deal with and you have to have guidelines if you know for salary increases and things like that
sw2292B-ms98-a-0062 387.979625 393.244250 just one of the things that that happens when someone when you're dealing with a large company
sw2292B-ms98-a-0063 393.244250 394.695125 but
