sw2236B-ms98-a-0002 1.042375 2.201500 good morning
sw2236B-ms98-a-0003 2.201500 5.297125 [silence]
sw2236B-ms98-a-0004 5.297125 6.654625 yes
sw2236B-ms98-a-0005 6.654625 13.206625 [silence]
sw2236B-ms98-a-0006 13.206625 22.549125 i- i always turn on the TV set and it seems like i catch that program in the last five minutes and
sw2236B-ms98-a-0007 22.549125 27.634375 i- i think it you know what i see is fascinating and i kind of enjoy it
sw2236B-ms98-a-0008 27.634375 29.033375 uh
sw2236B-ms98-a-0009 29.033375 32.563875 i've always had that hobby ever since i was a child
sw2236B-ms98-a-0010 32.563875 33.985375 and uh
sw2236B-ms98-a-0011 33.985375 34.991750 [silence]
sw2236B-ms98-a-0012 34.991750 39.742000 i refuse to get involved because i never had space for a permanent layout
sw2236B-ms98-a-0013 39.742000 45.555375 and then here about five years ago we bought a big old house out in Oaktown Virginia
sw2236B-ms98-a-0014 45.555375 48.389250 and there was uh there was two basements
sw2236B-ms98-a-0015 48.389250 51.203125 there were two two separate furnace rooms
sw2236B-ms98-a-0016 51.203125 57.260500 and so i took the smaller furnace room and now it's full of trains [laughter]
sw2236B-ms98-a-0017 57.260500 59.470000 [laughter]
sw2236B-ms98-a-0018 59.470000 94.001500 [silence]
sw2236B-ms98-a-0019 94.001500 95.311250 um
sw2236B-ms98-a-0020 95.311250 102.168000 [silence]
sw2236B-ms98-a-0021 102.168000 105.086125 do you still have the uh train set
sw2236B-ms98-a-0022 105.086125 106.743500 he has it
sw2236B-ms98-a-0023 106.743500 109.813125 [silence]
sw2236B-ms98-a-0024 109.813125 110.987125 um
sw2236B-ms98-a-0025 110.987125 128.364750 [silence]
sw2236B-ms98-a-0026 128.364750 130.380500 put it on display
sw2236B-ms98-a-0027 130.380500 134.686875 well those uh the early Lionels can be quite valuable
sw2236B-ms98-a-0028 134.686875 143.012625 [silence]
sw2236B-ms98-a-0029 143.012625 144.189250 yeah
sw2236B-ms98-a-0030 144.189250 146.319125 [silence]
sw2236B-ms98-a-0031 146.319125 157.748125 well some of those around the war years were uh kind of difficult to get a hold of because_1 Lionel got involved in manufacturing a lot of uh uh war equipment
sw2236B-ms98-a-0032 157.748125 163.451250 and uh i think they almost discontinued production uh in
sw2236B-ms98-a-0033 163.451250 166.145375 nineteen forty two and forty three
sw2236B-ms98-a-0034 166.145375 170.084625 so some of the pre-war models are quite valuable
sw2236B-ms98-a-0035 170.084625 186.647250 [silence]
sw2236B-ms98-a-0036 186.647250 195.030250 well i managed to sweet talk my brother out of uh his Lionel train set that uh dated back to about nineteen thirty three
sw2236B-ms98-a-0037 195.030250 198.818250 and uh he's kind of unhappy i've got it now
sw2236B-ms98-a-0038 198.818250 201.371750 [laughter] [laughter-but] i'm not going to give it back [laughter] 
sw2236B-ms98-a-0039 201.371750 204.802750 [silence]
sw2236B-ms98-a-0040 204.802750 206.950750 and i had a uh
sw2236B-ms98-a-0041 206.950750 213.686375 post uh World War version of the Pennsylvania Electric uh GT1 locomotives
sw2236B-ms98-a-0042 213.686375 218.110000 and it happened to be one of the rare paint jobs
sw2236B-ms98-a-0043 218.110000 223.372625 so i understand that that locomotive is worth around seven hundred and fifty dollars now
sw2236B-ms98-a-0044 223.372625 227.705250 so it's it's sitting on display on top of my bookcase
sw2236B-ms98-a-0045 227.705250 229.508500 [silence]
sw2236B-ms98-a-0046 229.508500 230.709375 yeah
sw2236B-ms98-a-0047 230.709375 250.497375 [silence]
sw2236B-ms98-a-0048 250.497375 251.934750 um-hum
sw2236B-ms98-a-0049 251.934750 259.600000 [silence]
sw2236B-ms98-a-0050 259.600000 265.012500 well Pennsylvania used to have uh some commercial displays
sw2236B-ms98-a-0051 265.012500 274.911250 there was one place that was halfway between Harrisburg and Allenstown Pennsylvania in a community called Midway which suggest it was halfway
sw2236B-ms98-a-0052 274.911250 276.590625 and uh
sw2236B-ms98-a-0053 276.590625 283.631000 they had a huge room which was probably uh forty feet wide and a hundred and forty feet long
sw2236B-ms98-a-0054 283.631000 293.839875 uh and the central portion of that room was occupied by one huge O gauge layout running uh uh Lionel tr[ain]- and American Flyer trains
sw2236B-ms98-a-0055 293.839875 298.876500 and they had done a lot of work on that with uh scenery and buildings
sw2236B-ms98-a-0056 298.876500 303.716625 and they had trolleys running around and uh a lot of animation in there
sw2236B-ms98-a-0057 303.716625 309.735750 and uh it was in business for a long long time i don't know it it still maybe in business
sw2236B-ms98-a-0058 309.735750 311.501000 [silence]
sw2236B-ms98-a-0059 311.501000 312.586625 yeah
sw2236B-ms98-a-0060 312.586625 315.900125 [silence]
sw2236B-ms98-a-0061 315.900125 321.577875 yes uh i bought a uh Bristol thirty five five for my wife
sw2236B-ms98-a-0062 321.577875 324.307750 and we keep it on the Chesapeake Bay
sw2236B-ms98-a-0063 324.307750 328.892625 and uh starting next weekend i'm gonna have to go down and uh
sw2236B-ms98-a-0064 328.892625 331.665500 fill out for the summer season
sw2236B-ms98-a-0065 331.665500 339.595875 we have a cruise plan to sail from uh Solomon to Maryland up to Philadelphia this summer
sw2236B-ms98-a-0066 339.595875 344.459500 about a two week cruise and uh two or three lay days in Philadelphia
sw2236B-ms98-a-0067 344.459500 345.758625 [silence]
sw2236B-ms98-a-0068 345.758625 356.581000 they have a a new waterfront uh marina in Philadelphia it isn't as developed as uh Water Side in Norfolk or the Baltimore uh waterfront
sw2236B-ms98-a-0069 356.581000 362.449250 but uh the marina is only about uh two or three blocks from the historic district
sw2236B-ms98-a-0070 362.449250 367.439625 so that's quite uh handy for our our youngsters we can take them_1 up and
sw2236B-ms98-a-0071 367.439625 372.151375 show them_1 Independence Hall the Liberty Bell and uh Franklin uh
sw2236B-ms98-a-0072 372.151375 373.830625 Franklin Square
sw2236B-ms98-a-0073 373.830625 389.372250 [silence]
sw2236B-ms98-a-0074 389.372250 390.845250 um
sw2236B-ms98-a-0075 390.845250 395.406750 well there are some uh good opportunities for that in the British Virgins
sw2236B-ms98-a-0076 395.406750 396.445000 [silence]
sw2236B-ms98-a-0077 396.445000 401.826625 uh that's uh that is almost an ideal sailing area uh 
sw2236B-ms98-a-0078 401.826625 411.244875 if you have a l[ittle]- even a little bit of experience uh i've seen a number of people go through a uh a cruising class in Annapolis
sw2236B-ms98-a-0079 411.244875 420.061500 where they might get uh maybe ten or fifteen hours of sailing experience go down to uh uh British Tortolla
sw2236B-ms98-a-0080 420.061500 422.528375 and charter a boat for a week
sw2236B-ms98-a-0081 422.528375 425.318375 and they take it out and have a grand time
sw2236B-ms98-a-0082 425.318375 430.607250 uh it's fairly sheltered waters right there and uh
sw2236B-ms98-a-0083 430.607250 437.021875 you don't need any fancy navigation equipment because you can see all your destinations from one spot
sw2236B-ms98-a-0084 437.021875 454.447000 [silence]
sw2236B-ms98-a-0085 454.447000 455.663000 um-hum
sw2236B-ms98-a-0086 455.663000 462.024000 uh i've been there several times uh the first trip uh
sw2236B-ms98-a-0087 462.024000 468.339375 we flew down and uh chartered a uh Morgan uh forty five
sw2236B-ms98-a-0088 468.339375 476.590500 and i had fun that then a few years later a guy i was racing with uh decided to take his boat down for a winter season
sw2236B-ms98-a-0089 476.590500 480.937250 and so i went offshore with him to uh Saint Thomas
sw2236B-ms98-a-0090 480.937250 486.484250 and then we cruised uh the American Virgins for a week before i flew home
sw2236B-ms98-a-0091 486.484250 489.464750 [silence]
sw2236B-ms98-a-0092 489.464750 493.813750 i think the better sight seeing is in the uh British Virgins
sw2236B-ms98-a-0093 493.813750 502.570125 uh there's uh some very nice places like the bass which is a uh sort of a huge monolithic rocks that you can
sw2236B-ms98-a-0094 502.570125 512.952625 you can walk up the beach and into these uh enormous caverns that are partially submerged and you can wade in the pools and so forth very popular tourist spot
sw2236B-ms98-a-0095 512.952625 514.355750 uh
sw2236B-ms98-a-0096 514.355750 519.470875 the Bitter End is an excellent resort up in uh [vocalized-noise]
sw2236B-ms98-a-0097 519.470875 527.693250 which is very easy to get into and there's some very nice reefs in that uh vicinity if you like snorkeling and uh scuba diving
sw2236B-ms98-a-0098 527.693250 528.992375 [silence]
sw2236B-ms98-a-0099 528.992375 536.141000 and uh there are some very nice resort hotels so you can go in and uh enjoy a very classy dinner
sw2236B-ms98-a-0100 536.141000 541.420000 uh the Peter Island Yacht Club is uh extremely exclusive
sw2236B-ms98-a-0101 541.420000 545.918625 like uh i think they're probably charging five hundred dollars a day for a room now
sw2236B-ms98-a-0102 545.918625 547.549625 [laughter]
sw2236B-ms98-a-0103 547.549625 549.257250 [silence]
sw2236B-ms98-a-0104 549.257250 550.702750 and uh
sw2236B-ms98-a-0105 550.702750 551.733625 [silence]
sw2236B-ms98-a-0106 551.733625 555.451500 it's there kind of a nice place to visit uh 
sw2236B-ms98-a-0107 555.451500 567.355000 uh it's better being on a boat than being on land because uh your boat becomes your hotel your uh your dining room your taxi cab and uh everything else
sw2236B-ms98-a-0108 567.355000 569.967750 [silence]
sw2236B-ms98-a-0109 569.967750 571.996875 well i'd recommend it
sw2236B-ms98-a-0110 571.996875 574.435250 [silence]
