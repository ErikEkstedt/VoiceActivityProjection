sw2291A-ms98-a-0002 0.269625 13.066750 uh interestingly enough in my younger days i taught school for two years while my husband was getting his business established and i find the changes uh in the school system
sw2291A-ms98-a-0003 13.066750 16.353250 i think a lot of them very positive
sw2291A-ms98-a-0004 16.353250 26.653375 uh since his retirement the first of January in nineteen ninety i've gone back to subbing and of course subbing is a very different
sw2291A-ms98-a-0005 26.653375 29.576875 endeavor than teaching uh
sw2291A-ms98-a-0006 29.576875 38.720250 it's very difficult and i've after almost two years i've become a little bit disillusioned and i'm not real sure that
sw2291A-ms98-a-0007 38.720250 42.001875 i'm going to go back to it because uh
sw2291A-ms98-a-0008 42.001875 49.810625 of discipline uh although i've never had a problem with it i guess i've just gotten a little tired of fighting
sw2291A-ms98-a-0009 49.810625 54.153750 [silence]
sw2291A-ms98-a-0010 54.153750 63.978875 i think uh the quality of education in the high school system here is better i think the teachers that we have now are more professional
sw2291A-ms98-a-0011 63.978875 70.520000 and i think the students are more education minded than they were twenty years ago
sw2291A-ms98-a-0012 70.520000 91.897125 [silence]
sw2291A-ms98-a-0013 91.897125 93.412750 uh-huh
sw2291A-ms98-a-0014 93.412750 95.247125 [silence]
sw2291A-ms98-a-0015 95.247125 96.559500 uh-huh
sw2291A-ms98-a-0016 96.559500 103.968000 [silence]
sw2291A-ms98-a-0017 103.968000 108.728500 in the community itself that spill over so to speak
sw2291A-ms98-a-0018 108.728500 123.334125 [silence]
sw2291A-ms98-a-0019 123.334125 124.956625 uh-huh
sw2291A-ms98-a-0020 124.956625 133.486000 [silence]
sw2291A-ms98-a-0021 133.486000 135.178125 um-hum
sw2291A-ms98-a-0022 135.178125 142.702750 i find that the school uses the parents as an excuse and the parents use the school as an excuse however
sw2291A-ms98-a-0023 142.702750 143.795625 [silence]
sw2291A-ms98-a-0024 143.795625 156.596625 we're in uh as i said a small town in Indiana and it's a WASP community with a student body of five hundred in the high school so the setting is very different than it would be in
sw2291A-ms98-a-0025 156.596625 163.287250 Dallas or Chicago or even Indianapolis which is a couple hours south of us
sw2291A-ms98-a-0026 163.287250 165.191000 uh but to me
sw2291A-ms98-a-0027 165.191000 166.611250 the
sw2291A-ms98-a-0028 166.611250 167.787250 [silence]
sw2291A-ms98-a-0029 167.787250 182.488625 the more gifted or the higher intelligent children are more geared to learning than they were they're more into the school system than they were twenty years ago and uh i find the Say No to Drugs campaign here 
sw2291A-ms98-a-0030 182.488625 186.982875 to be i think very effective unless i have my head in the sand
sw2291A-ms98-a-0031 186.982875 199.559000 [silence]
sw2291A-ms98-a-0032 199.559000 200.980250 uh-huh
sw2291A-ms98-a-0033 200.980250 208.199625 [silence]
sw2291A-ms98-a-0034 208.199625 212.468250 uh-huh oh sure there are high schools as large as our community
sw2291A-ms98-a-0035 212.468250 215.643750 which makes a totally different situation
sw2291A-ms98-a-0036 215.643750 224.651125 i've i've never felt that pouring more tax dollars in was the answer to solving any school problems or most of the school problems
sw2291A-ms98-a-0037 224.651125 235.992500 [silence]
sw2291A-ms98-a-0038 235.992500 237.200375 uh-huh
sw2291A-ms98-a-0039 237.200375 259.008000 [silence]
sw2291A-ms98-a-0040 259.008000 270.731000 uh-huh isn't that the way with most groups though they become a self-protection thing uh of saving jobs or getting more salary uh
sw2291A-ms98-a-0041 270.731000 273.385250 i do i do find that
sw2291A-ms98-a-0042 273.385250 287.809125 the ma[jority]- the majority of teachers in our group are very professional but then of course we're a stable community and many of them have been in the system for twenty years which i just can't think you'd find that in a large city school
sw2291A-ms98-a-0043 287.809125 303.679500 [silence]
sw2291A-ms98-a-0044 303.679500 306.284250 uh-huh uh-huh
sw2291A-ms98-a-0045 306.284250 312.540625 [silence]
sw2291A-ms98-a-0046 312.540625 313.871750 uh-huh

sw2291A-ms98-a-0049 316.859875 343.538250 [silence]
sw2291A-ms98-a-0050 343.538250 346.690000 except we don't have another school
sw2291A-ms98-a-0051 346.690000 348.232750 [silence]
sw2291A-ms98-a-0052 348.232750 349.567625 uh-huh
sw2291A-ms98-a-0053 349.567625 352.715000 [silence]
sw2291A-ms98-a-0054 352.715000 355.100625 because they have fewer students
sw2291A-ms98-a-0055 355.100625 359.026250 [silence]
sw2291A-ms98-a-0056 359.026250 360.340000 uh-huh
sw2291A-ms98-a-0057 360.340000 369.441125 [silence]
sw2291A-ms98-a-0058 369.441125 373.735250 you don't find that parents are getting more involved in your area
sw2291A-ms98-a-0059 373.735250 377.658250 [silence]
sw2291A-ms98-a-0060 377.658250 378.991875 um-hum
sw2291A-ms98-a-0061 378.991875 381.067125 [silence]
sw2291A-ms98-a-0062 381.067125 382.508500 um-hum
sw2291A-ms98-a-0063 382.508500 383.948625 uh-huh
sw2291A-ms98-a-0064 383.948625 395.685000 i think single parents probably contribute a lot of the problems in school systems because the system's really getting sixty percent of the student's day
sw2291A-ms98-a-0065 395.685000 405.276000 if if the mother or the father certainly would have to work and they're not getting home until probably five o'clock at the very earliest and the student's out at three
sw2291A-ms98-a-0066 405.276000 419.467375 i think really uh the school does have more of that student's time because eight hours of the time that the student is with the parent they're going to be sleeping and certainly the parent needs some social life besides uh 
sw2291A-ms98-a-0067 419.467375 429.031875 [silence]
sw2291A-ms98-a-0068 429.031875 433.180000 they might need to be dealt with yeah
sw2291A-ms98-a-0069 433.180000 443.991125 [silence]
sw2291A-ms98-a-0070 443.991125 445.360000 uh-huh
sw2291A-ms98-a-0071 445.360000 453.193625 uh-huh And we did have we did recently have a a group here formed called Students for Academic Excellence
sw2291A-ms98-a-0072 453.193625 467.257500 that was formed by concerned parents and they see that these these kids are getting honor jackets and they're getting certificates and they're getting uh more access to scholarships uh on a par
sw2291A-ms98-a-0073 467.257500 480.123375 with the athletes which uh this was formed i think probably in the last three years and that's been a very positive thing for education itself because so often the emphasis is on
sw2291A-ms98-a-0074 480.123375 486.551250 uh baseball basketball and football and it gets away from what the school is established for originally 
sw2291A-ms98-a-0075 486.551250 489.545250 uh 
sw2291A-ms98-a-0076 489.545250 494.764625 [laughter] well this is basketball in Indiana so 
sw2291A-ms98-a-0077 494.764625 507.367375 uh-huh We do all have our sport In fact we've been on a real high here because our basketball team won their regional for the first time in the history of the school So sport is uh
sw2291A-ms98-a-0078 507.367375 515.197625 has been really first and foremost here in the last month But we hope that education is first and foremost for the year
sw2291A-ms98-a-0079 515.197625 517.566500 nice talking to you
sw2291A-ms98-a-0080 517.566500 519.209250 uh-huh bye
