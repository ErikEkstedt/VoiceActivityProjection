sw2291B-ms98-a-0008 48.857875 54.489875 yeah what what do you said you think there're some improvements what do you think the improvements have been

sw2291B-ms98-a-0010 69.939375 70.834125 um-hum
sw2291B-ms98-a-0011 70.834125 77.472375 i think the problems that i see in the system uh are i- i tend to see more in uh
sw2291B-ms98-a-0012 77.472375 80.804250 large inner city school districts
sw2291B-ms98-a-0013 80.804250 82.891375 that uh
sw2291B-ms98-a-0014 82.891375 96.372250 and i've i've noticed that uh suburban or rural schools tend to have much fewer problems at least what i from what i hear than than than the inside the city school districts
sw2291B-ms98-a-0015 96.372250 104.159750 and so i think the problem isn't so much the school system as in the things that go on around it
sw2291B-ms98-a-0016 104.159750 105.407500 [silence]
sw2291B-ms98-a-0017 105.407500 106.255875 yeah

sw2291B-ms98-a-0019 108.170625 116.476500 um-hum well my my personal opinion is that so many parents especially those parents who are in a lower income and have to
sw2291B-ms98-a-0020 116.476500 119.055625 spend more of their energy on work
sw2291B-ms98-a-0021 119.055625 127.725625 they say okay well i- i don't have to teach my kids anything the school's going to do it for me and i think the school can't
sw2291B-ms98-a-0022 127.725625 135.210375 do that the school can only exist as something to help the parents out not something to take the parents' place
sw2291B-ms98-a-0023 135.210375 142.215125 [silence]
sw2291B-ms98-a-0024 142.215125 144.293875 um that that can be yeah

sw2291B-ms98-a-0032 190.995125 192.327625 [silence]
sw2291B-ms98-a-0033 192.327625 205.160625 that you know kind of goes along it it it's a small enough school where people can know each other and and they can work together to thwart off problems when when you've got a high school with you know three or four thousand students
sw2291B-ms98-a-0034 205.160625 209.269625 um there's just no it's it's very difficult to keep track of them all
sw2291B-ms98-a-0035 209.269625 212.117625 [silence]
sw2291B-ms98-a-0036 212.117625 212.777750 yeah

sw2291B-ms98-a-0039 224.263000 233.938500 yeah the i- i find that i- i haven't seen any cases where that's been very effective and that seems to be what people want to do is just you know put more money into it
sw2291B-ms98-a-0040 233.938500 237.040875 and i just don't have a whole lot of confidence in that
sw2291B-ms98-a-0041 237.040875 243.582875 i also you know i consider for example the the teachers the National Education Association you know they
sw2291B-ms98-a-0042 243.582875 248.895625 i would like to see them be more of a professional organization rather than a union
sw2291B-ms98-a-0043 248.895625 260.834625 because we n[eed]- you know we need to we need to uh instead of worrying about saving jobs or raising salaries i think we need to worry about uh how well the job's getting done

sw2291B-ms98-a-0045 265.315375 266.459125 um-hum

sw2291B-ms98-a-0051 287.120000 288.142500 um-hum
sw2291B-ms98-a-0052 288.142500 299.147875 uh but you know back to the idea of parents i my my personal feelings is that parents need to be taking more responsibility
sw2291B-ms98-a-0053 299.147875 310.080375 i think the way i like to look at it you know a lot of people look at well whose job is it to teach the kids well it's the school's job i think whose job is it to teach the kids well primarily it's the parents job
sw2291B-ms98-a-0054 310.080375 316.665375 because_1 the kids spend more time with the parents than they spend at school and the school is just there to help the parents
sw2291B-ms98-a-0055 316.665375 324.753500 so i think the the number one responsibility is on the heads of the parents and and we need to get to the idea well if the kids are
sw2291B-ms98-a-0056 324.753500 332.970500 are doing poorly in school then the parents need to take some sort of responsibility and and take some sort of action instead of
sw2291B-ms98-a-0057 332.970500 337.172375 just complaining about what the school is doing or not doing and sometimes
sw2291B-ms98-a-0058 337.172375 344.697375 if the parents don't like the way the school is being run the appropriate action is to have the choice to take that kid out of that school and put him in a different school
sw2291B-ms98-a-0059 344.697375 346.530500 [silence]
sw2291B-ms98-a-0060 346.530500 353.008375 yeah that's in in small communities that's a difficult choice but then the small communities are the ones with fewer problems
sw2291B-ms98-a-0061 353.008375 354.916125 [silence]
sw2291B-ms98-a-0062 354.916125 367.520250 yeah it's it's the big cities that have these kind of problems and there i like to see that the parents be able to have a choice saying i don't like the way this school is being run i want to send my child to someplace where they'll be properly uh
sw2291B-ms98-a-0063 367.520250 370.204750 properly taught and properly uh trained
sw2291B-ms98-a-0064 370.204750 373.613500 [silence]
sw2291B-ms98-a-0065 373.613500 384.831375 some parents are but some parents don't have the opportunity to do that as easily you know people that are working two jobs or single parents uh that sort of thing

sw2291B-ms98-a-0073 419.804875 430.980375 and you know what it feels like to come home after a long day at work you you just you you want to rest for a little while and and maybe the children uh don't want you to rest [vocalized-noise] 
sw2291B-ms98-a-0074 430.980375 432.561250 yeah

sw2291B-ms98-a-0076 433.571750 437.008125 and it's it's a difficult problem and it's one that
sw2291B-ms98-a-0077 437.008125 443.977875 w[ell]- basically i think in in in large measure it's it's it's up to the parents to take the responsibility for what's happening
sw2291B-ms98-a-0078 443.977875 446.261750 to their childrens education i think
