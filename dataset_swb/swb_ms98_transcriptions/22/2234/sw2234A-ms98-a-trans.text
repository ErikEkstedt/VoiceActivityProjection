sw2234A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 7.205625 [noise] well my family moved to Texas about eight years ago my husband was raised here but i i have never lived here so um
sw2234A-ms98-a-0002 7.205625 19.495375 wh[en]- when we came back to Texas i i was really kind of excited there wasn't a state income tax and there wasn't a tax on food that we purchased at the grocery store and things and all of that was new to me so [noise]
sw2234A-ms98-a-0003 19.495375 25.219750 i'm sort of feeling like we're getting a better [laughter-deal] here than what i was accustomed to
sw2234A-ms98-a-0004 25.219750 27.283750 [silence]
sw2234A-ms98-a-0005 27.283750 35.605125 well i lived in Missouri and then in Utah and then um and both places had pretty good state income tax
sw2234A-ms98-a-0006 35.605125 42.706125 and um we've always paid tax um you know on everything we purchased you know even food at the grocery store so
sw2234A-ms98-a-0007 42.706125 50.676000 i thought it was really you know kind of a pretty good deal not to have to pay tax on your gro[ceries]- groceries and
sw2234A-ms98-a-0008 50.676000 58.152375 [noise] but i think i mean i i don't enjoy paying taxes and it's hard but um
sw2234A-ms98-a-0009 58.152375 68.932625 i think that's what we have to have to you know have our streets and and have our government and [noise] excuse me and have
sw2234A-ms98-a-0010 68.932625 78.614875 and have the services that we need and we have to pay for them and pay for the employment of the people that run them and and things like that and i think i guess
sw2234A-ms98-a-0011 78.614875 87.983250 what i feel is that most people um they don't like to pay taxes because they feel like well there's some people who aren't paying their fair share
sw2234A-ms98-a-0012 87.983250 90.993625 and um that makes you feel bad
sw2234A-ms98-a-0013 90.993625 92.969500 [silence]
sw2234A-ms98-a-0014 92.969500 106.743500 right and you know when um when last year the the elections were going on the governors election and state and you know i i didn't have anything against um Clayton Williams personally or anything but um
sw2234A-ms98-a-0015 106.743500 120.999000 it was kind of hard for me to think here's someone who as wealthy as he is didn't have to pay any income tax that he said that year he claimed [noise] he had didn't have to pay income tax and he thought well you know there's some people
sw2234A-ms98-a-0016 120.999000 132.496875 are living pretty pretty good life styles but they're not paying income tax and that's not fair to me and there's you know some people who uh are abusing
sw2234A-ms98-a-0017 132.496875 145.251500 the systems that we pay taxes to support and all of that makes us feel bad but i think you know all in all how i feel is that um i'm willing to pay the taxes because
sw2234A-ms98-a-0018 145.251500 159.321625 i think i like our country compared to the other countries i've studied and visited and um i'm willing to pay extra to live here and to enjoy the services i enjoy how do you feel

sw2234A-ms98-a-0048 270.215125 274.612625 well it is and um and sometimes i think um
sw2234A-ms98-a-0049 274.612625 282.171125 well for myself that the income that we have we're paid a certain salary but i think the employer keeps in mind
sw2234A-ms98-a-0050 282.171125 296.809625 this'll be deducted you know some so many taxes will be deducted from it and so i think we're you know our salaries are a little bit higher because we have to pay taxes on it and so i think you know in that way we're compensated
sw2234A-ms98-a-0051 296.809625 302.998750 um just by our society yet you know they don't pay you um
sw2234A-ms98-a-0052 302.998750 311.765250 what just what it would take and then if if you pay taxes on it you wouldn't have any money left over and [noise] and um but some of the people that make
sw2234A-ms98-a-0053 311.765250 324.460750 a great deal of money and everything um i wish that they would [laughter-i] guess because i'm not one of them_1 [laughter] i wish that they would um you know realize that they
sw2234A-ms98-a-0054 324.460750 329.939250 they couldn't make this kind of money they couldn't live that kind of life style anywhere else
sw2234A-ms98-a-0055 329.939250 344.495375 in that even if they made that kind of money there's some countries that have like fifty percent income tax you know that have socialized medicines and things and that they um they wouldn't be able to enjoy the
sw2234A-ms98-a-0056 344.495375 355.572625 uproots that and that so that you know they need to be willing to pay a little bit more for it yes they've earned it and yes they've that's great they've you know had such great fortune here
sw2234A-ms98-a-0057 355.572625 360.491375 but they need to pay for it too because they couldn't do that somewhere else
sw2234A-ms98-a-0058 360.491375 367.985000 um um i like Texas um not having the state income tax and i hope that
sw2234A-ms98-a-0059 367.985000 378.010625 because um you know that we've had enough industry here that i guess it is that why we don't [laughter] the industry here is able to to um fund
sw2234A-ms98-a-0060 378.010625 383.978250 the state because_1 we have oil here and things i mean that's what i've always heard is that um
sw2234A-ms98-a-0061 383.978250 388.492625 [silence]
sw2234A-ms98-a-0062 388.492625 390.270750 big boom

sw2234A-ms98-a-0064 392.234875 406.999625 [noise] yeah there's something about um the industry in the state that um there's enough i know we moved here from Houston and um the city had it's enough money it was really nice that they had uh
sw2234A-ms98-a-0065 406.999625 417.790500 but they began to cut back because of the oil problems but um you know they would ha[ve]- have um so many community outdoor theaters and and like uh community
sw2234A-ms98-a-0066 417.790500 427.470250 country club type things that the it was such nice services to offer the residents in the city and i really liked that

sw2234A-ms98-a-0070 435.197000 446.966375 yeah it's true and i'm you know like the the property tax that we pay and everything is so much higher than my parents pay in Missouri but um i'm
sw2234A-ms98-a-0071 446.966375 453.808625 i'm comfortable at least this year with we pay we have some good schools you know the school thing might be changing but
sw2234A-ms98-a-0072 453.808625 467.494250 i'm i['m]- willing to pay for that for my children and i'm willing to sacrifice i guess i mean i'm not going to be the kind of person that's going to grumble about the taxes even though we're paying pretty high percentage um
sw2234A-ms98-a-0073 467.494250 481.945250 i feel like you get what you pay for and i want to be here and i i enjoy i enjoy living here in this country and having seen other countries i'd much rather live here and pay taxes than live somewhere else and
sw2234A-ms98-a-0074 481.945250 490.757250 and not anyway well [laughter] [laughter-i] guess i better let you go
