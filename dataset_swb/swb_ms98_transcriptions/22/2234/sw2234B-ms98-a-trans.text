sw2234B-ms98-a-0011 158.449375 167.495250 well yeah i agree that you have to pay taxes for the services you get and i think that you know i don't think there's probably any really
sw2234B-ms98-a-0012 167.495250 175.468875 pu[t]- that system that everybody would think is fair as far as being taxed you know i guess in Texas with uh we live here also
sw2234B-ms98-a-0013 175.468875 189.657625 and that it's mostly sales tax so it's really the people that have the money to buy things that are paying the more because they're paying the sales tax on the larger items that they buy and stuff i've lived in Texas most of my life we um lived in Kansas City for a couple of years and
sw2234B-ms98-a-0014 189.657625 198.595250 we were kind of in for a rude awakening they had personal property taxes on like cars and the first year we're there it was like eight hundred dollars and we're like
sw2234B-ms98-a-0015 198.595250 208.424250 you know what [laughter-happened] [laughter-is] my husband said i used to complain to pay sixty dollars to get licensed in Texas and now [laughter] you know so i mean that was kind of different and then to file a
sw2234B-ms98-a-0016 208.424250 216.279500 a state income tax was also kind of tough too um i guess since we've been married we've moved a lot and so it always seems like
sw2234B-ms98-a-0017 216.279500 224.741625 you know we're always paying in taxes for something and so th[e]- it was kind of nice this year to finally be able to get a little bit of money back but
sw2234B-ms98-a-0018 224.741625 233.952000 i um have accounting background so then i also have done tax returns in the past and for other people when i worked [noise] for accounting firm
sw2234B-ms98-a-0019 233.952000 238.999625 and uh you know it is kind of sad to see all these people that you know have the
sw2234B-ms98-a-0020 238.999625 248.981625 resources to hire somebody and have the money to spend to put their money in places [noise] they don't have to pay taxes or to buy something that loses money so that they can
sw2234B-ms98-a-0021 248.981625 255.489625 you know offset the income that they get or whatever so but you know i think if
sw2234B-ms98-a-0022 255.489625 263.999250 i can understand maybe why the rich people don't want to pay you know a large large percent because i[t]- you know that's not really fair either if they've earned their money
sw2234B-ms98-a-0023 263.999250 270.498875 by themselves well you know people [noise] just kind of given the [laughter-money] it's kind of depressing sometimes i think
