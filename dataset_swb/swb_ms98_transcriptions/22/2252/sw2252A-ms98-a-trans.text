sw2252A-ms98-a-0002 0.499000 3.987250 well what is your view do you consider the Soviet Union a threat
sw2252A-ms98-a-0003 3.987250 19.448875 [silence]
sw2252A-ms98-a-0004 19.448875 21.466375 sure

sw2252A-ms98-a-0006 31.995000 33.684000 right
sw2252A-ms98-a-0007 33.684000 38.276500 it's it's hard to to know anymore if it's uh a threat one way or another because
sw2252A-ms98-a-0008 38.276500 45.787250 uh it used to be s[o]- so [vocalized-noise] much in the past that whatever the top said the rest fell you know rank and file in behind it
sw2252A-ms98-a-0009 45.787250 53.473000 and now that with Gorbachev is introducing more i guess freedoms or expressions of freedom it doesn't look as though
sw2252A-ms98-a-0010 53.473000 67.958500 you know everybody's following the same pattern and uh th[e]- the people who are you know the staunch military conservative people you never know well Gorbachev's future is like whereas whereas in the past it was seen as you know whoever was
sw2252A-ms98-a-0011 67.958500 72.496000 the head of uh the communist party was seen as you know untouchable
sw2252A-ms98-a-0012 72.496000 83.488500 [silence]
sw2252A-ms98-a-0013 83.488500 85.239250 um-hum

sw2252A-ms98-a-0020 113.472750 123.356125 right well it it's amazing just because of the drain it's been on you know both economies that our economy is of course been able to uh withstand that a little better
sw2252A-ms98-a-0021 123.356125 131.763000 but uh the Russian economy they you know they i don't know what the percentage is but i heard it one time it's just some ungodly number just to support the military machine
sw2252A-ms98-a-0022 131.763000 136.952250 and finally you know who knows maybe they're finally waking up and saying you know we can't afford this
sw2252A-ms98-a-0023 136.952250 143.481250 uh the US isn't the threat that we've always made them out to be you know even if they're saying that beneath the doors
sw2252A-ms98-a-0024 143.481250 156.657500 but it's hard to think that just one person can bring that much of a radical change in that short of period even if it is you know the best thing in the long run it just steps on too many people's toes who are comfortable with the way the situation is
sw2252A-ms98-a-0025 156.657500 166.487125 [silence]

sw2252A-ms98-a-0034 198.263875 209.981750 well it's interesting anymore the world's getting so small that it doesn't seem to tolerate anymore any kind of the expansionism philosophy tha[t]- that was here in you know twenty years ago
sw2252A-ms98-a-0035 209.981750 217.620750 uh but of course the people who have challenged that or tried to do on it have [vocalized-noise] have not been world powers
sw2252A-ms98-a-0036 217.620750 228.491125 so it's easier for us to say you know to an Iraq you know uh you can't do this get back you know or we're going to force you whereas you know if the Soviet Union would've
sw2252A-ms98-a-0037 228.491125 241.789500 who knows what taking over Mongolia or or something like that who is really will we've been more just rhetoric uh rather than going in there officially uh or you know physically and try to to remove them

sw2252A-ms98-a-0043 257.965750 264.352250 personally i don't see as Gorbachev as being maybe a threat and i think he's actually honestly trying to do some change
sw2252A-ms98-a-0044 264.352250 273.989375 but i don't believe that he in this first pass around you know being the first one to really turn things around or attempt to is going to be allowed to get away with it either

sw2252A-ms98-a-0054 319.951875 331.721125 yeah that was always kind of interesting people you know a lot of my friends have a taken [vocalized-noise] the stance of you know these people are just trying to be free and trying to get away and i'm thinking more of it from a nationalistic you know if i'm
sw2252A-ms98-a-0055 331.721125 338.718500 a Soviet an[d]- if part of you know south let's say South Dakota wanted to succ[eed]- you know succeed
sw2252A-ms98-a-0056 338.718500 347.177125 am i going to stand for that now i realize that the origins are are different and that we all joined under a common direction and a common bond to begin with
sw2252A-ms98-a-0057 347.177125 360.471375 uh and that they may have been forced i'm not that familiar with their future but i you know i it's easy to believe that they were probably more forced into a pact than uh a volunteer or willingness to join but

sw2252A-ms98-a-0065 383.497000 392.734625 well that whole uh the whole i[dea]- idea if you look at the Russian history and i guess all countries the way it used to be is the only way to truly protect your borders was to have a buffer
sw2252A-ms98-a-0066 392.734625 400.051500 and that was the whole idea of why they had so many buffers and maybe you know more and more people are seeing or countries hopefully are seeing that
sw2252A-ms98-a-0067 400.051500 407.691625 [vocalized-noise] that buffer isn't going to help you you can li[ke]- i guess like with uh Israel is a perfect example the reason they have the Angolan Heights and the
sw2252A-ms98-a-0068 407.691625 420.950250 the uh all their buffer area is between Jordan and uh the Sinai an[d]- and Lebanon was just as a buffer but you know as you can see with the the scuds go right over there
sw2252A-ms98-a-0069 420.950250 426.553250 yeah there's there's very little that that buys you anymore in today's technology
