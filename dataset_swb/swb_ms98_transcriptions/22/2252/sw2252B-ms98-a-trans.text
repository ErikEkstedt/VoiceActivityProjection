sw2252B-ms98-a-0007 24.311000 35.496250 you know if if they have completely chan[ged]- [vocalized-noise] the place has completely turned that much around to where they're not you know not what they used to be uh [laughter] [vocalized-noise]

sw2252B-ms98-a-0016 86.250250 93.971000 to clobber you the first thing they do is sort of say well you know we're we're ashamed we're not going to do that anymore and uh
sw2252B-ms98-a-0017 93.971000 101.456000 [noise] um you know i'd i'd like to think that that isn't true but uh i- i you know the evidence is that
sw2252B-ms98-a-0018 101.456000 114.956375 uh you know he's he's let some some stuff go you know the east German situation it's just the whole thing is so incomprehensible you know if i'd have been asleep for five years and read it in a book i'd say no no no that didn't couldn't have happened that way

sw2252B-ms98-a-0031 164.734750 177.993625 you know leery of the whole thing what i haven't seen is the uh you know a great stepping back in the military situation you know it's it's one thing you know to let us go ahead an[d]-
sw2252B-ms98-a-0032 177.993625 189.420250 sort of disarm and you know i even had a thought once that the whole Iraqi thing might've been just a a deal to go ahead and let us uh you know expend some
sw2252B-ms98-a-0033 189.420250 200.287500 some military hardware of course it didn't turn out that way and uh uh that that may have been a a a kind of far out way of thinking about it i don't know

sw2252B-ms98-a-0045 239.976750 248.152625 well th[e]- the China situation you know the when it looked like that thing was was turning around and then all of the sudden it was like somebody in the
sw2252B-ms98-a-0046 248.152625 257.796250 in uh Red Square or wherever said okay and that's enough and the tanks came in and you know pretty much took care of that and

sw2252B-ms98-a-0050 272.991500 283.985625 yeah well this would be like if somebody was elected president of the United States and suddenly took off toward you know just s[ome]- some pretty hard by the socialism and uh
sw2252B-ms98-a-0051 283.985625 286.458500 you know th[e]- the reaction
sw2252B-ms98-a-0052 286.458500 294.991375 [noise] you know th[e]- the economic well the uh the social structure of the Soviet Union you know it it's it's coming apart at the seams
sw2252B-ms98-a-0053 294.991375 303.497875 you know and i've heard people say well you know it's just like the American Civil War will there be a union or not well no it's not the same sort of a thing at all because that
sw2252B-ms98-a-0054 303.497875 308.994125 the whole Soviet system was put together under total force you know there was no
sw2252B-ms98-a-0055 308.994125 321.457625 as as we are seeing now with a lot of those areas wanting out of it you know they uh nobody vo[ted]- you know a lot man those people didn't vote to become part of the Soviet Union they had no choice
sw2252B-ms98-a-0056 321.457625 339.473375 [silence]

sw2252B-ms98-a-0061 358.249750 362.460250 yeah there there was uh the whole thing was put together 
sw2252B-ms98-a-0062 362.460250 373.301625 you know by force there's there's no no real question about that and some of the countries that were forced in at th[e]- later dates is the three Baltic countries you know came in in the forties
sw2252B-ms98-a-0063 373.301625 385.554500 and uh it's well it's not that they came in it's they were conquered by the Germans [noise] and then the Russians even took it back from the Germans and never bothered to give it back you know so that's a a little different situation
sw2252B-ms98-a-0064 385.554500 391.769250 [silence]

sw2252B-ms98-a-0069 418.468125 422.482500 um-hum yeah they don't really pay a whole lot of attention to buffers
sw2252B-ms98-a-0070 422.482500 425.487250 [silence]
sw2252B-ms98-a-0071 425.487250 440.205500 i knew a lot of guys in the service when they were sent to Germany that said that's the safest place in the world because if a war starts all the bombs are going to go right over Germany and they're going to land in other places you know that's going to be the safest place to be [laughter] yeah
sw2252B-ms98-a-0072 440.205500 445.507250 yeah yeah well uh i- i guess
sw2252B-ms98-a-0073 445.507250 448.242375 what they'd have to do to uh
sw2252B-ms98-a-0074 448.242375 449.747500 [silence]
sw2252B-ms98-a-0075 449.747500 459.491000 [vocalized-noise] i really don't know you know in in the uh in you know i hope that what's happening is exactly the way it appears you know some reason or other
sw2252B-ms98-a-0076 459.491000 471.272000 you know i[s]- is uh it's kind of a strange thing we've been trying to make something like this happen for so long that when it finally happens you say whoa wait a minute you know what's uh what's what's really happening here
sw2252B-ms98-a-0077 471.272000 481.988875 but you wonder how well this thing Bo[ris]- who was it Boris Yeltsin the guy that's running the uh or evidently was elected president of the Soviet for the Russian republic which is i guess the
sw2252B-ms98-a-0078 481.988875 484.181000 uh the biggest
sw2252B-ms98-a-0079 484.181000 487.486750 [silence]
sw2252B-ms98-a-0080 487.486750 488.999500 um-hum
sw2252B-ms98-a-0081 488.999500 494.713125 well in the center but you got uh the the great big area that's just was traditionally known as Russia
sw2252B-ms98-a-0082 494.713125 507.465625 and then all these little nationality groups around it you know that were you know was there nineteen of them or or whatever you know and these were all the Soviet autonomists
sw2252B-ms98-a-0083 507.465625 512.482500 [vocalized-noise] you know they had some real fancy names for them a matter of fact when the uh [noise]
sw2252B-ms98-a-0084 512.482500 522.991125 yeah what i read when the uh the uh United Nations was setup in in San Francisco one of the first things the Russians wanted to do was bring in each one of the uh
sw2252B-ms98-a-0085 522.991125 524.956250 of these
sw2252B-ms98-a-0086 524.956250 530.988875 you know republics as a separate country you know so there'd be there'd be nineteen rather than one
sw2252B-ms98-a-0087 530.988875 539.787375 and uh the United States said well that'd mean we get to bring in forty eight you know and uh that sort of you know they backed down on that
sw2252B-ms98-a-0088 539.787375 546.676500 [silence]
sw2252B-ms98-a-0089 546.676500 560.709250 yeah well i wonder if that [laughter] wh[ether]- uh wh[ether]- whether get shot by something that's called uh an economic force or whether it's called a military pact you know it's all you can change the name of something but i wonder if it's still
sw2252B-ms98-a-0090 560.709250 568.770000 exists although i've seen some evidence that you know the uh the Russian soldiers [vocalized-noise]
sw2252B-ms98-a-0091 568.770000 575.999000 well [vocalized-noise] the funny thing there is they're not particularly welcome back home because_1 there's they're having a housing shortages now what do you do with all these
sw2252B-ms98-a-0092 575.999000 585.498500 troops that have been taken care of by uh Bulgaria and and Czechoslovakia and now all of a sudden they're going home and somebody's got to pay for their

sw2252B-ms98-a-0094 590.290125 592.733125 yeah well that's not
