sw2227A-ms98-a-0029 96.372000 105.337750 because we don't want to do anything like study or anything so all the all we do is turn like like when i was in high school i used to do like my homework in front of the TV set you know
sw2227A-ms98-a-0030 105.337750 106.517375 [silence]

sw2227A-ms98-a-0032 107.723000 109.883125 [silence]

sw2227A-ms98-a-0037 120.327875 121.270000 [noise]

sw2227A-ms98-a-0039 124.554625 125.701250 [laughter]
sw2227A-ms98-a-0040 125.701250 132.031000 so uh let's see what else like the news we don't watch because they're boring
sw2227A-ms98-a-0041 132.031000 137.758125 yeah especially the war i mean it was like i haven't i seen this episode before you know
sw2227A-ms98-a-0042 137.758125 140.510500 [silence]
sw2227A-ms98-a-0043 140.510500 142.161000 yeah i know
sw2227A-ms98-a-0044 142.161000 154.242375 and and in North C[arolina]- see the the the thing is [vocalized-noise] like here they just they just give you like local news okay like a house burned down in this little town and were here and i go so what happened worldwide you know 
sw2227A-ms98-a-0045 154.242375 166.269750 it's like you know even though two hundred and fifty thousand people died somewhere else they're not going to tell you you know they're going to spend more time on doing a a thing on a on a cross guard who's a hundred and five years old than they are on anything else you know
sw2227A-ms98-a-0046 166.269750 172.823625 so but uh let's see what else oh we watch like for example uh okay do you watch Star Trek
sw2227A-ms98-a-0047 172.823625 173.858875 [silence]
sw2227A-ms98-a-0048 173.858875 176.144125 okay well i used to hate Star Trek
sw2227A-ms98-a-0049 176.144125 180.581375 i thought i thought like when it like when i was like in high school and junior high school i used to hate it
sw2227A-ms98-a-0050 180.581375 189.981250 but then we started watching it and and like the new ones are pretty cool because because they got like uh like special like especially things that like fuck with your mind
sw2227A-ms98-a-0051 189.981250 201.727625 because what happened is [vocalized-noise] like they have this hologram right where you walk in and you can program and everything looks real and you can touch everything and stuff but it's only a program and it's really great because sometimes it's like 
sw2227A-ms98-a-0052 201.727625 213.073000 the hologram makes up all these things and uh i mean sometimes [vocalized-noise] sometimes it's funny sometimes it's not but uh you know it's something to pass the time -[un]til we do and then and then we watch football 
sw2227A-ms98-a-0053 213.073000 214.311375 [silence]
sw2227A-ms98-a-0054 214.311375 216.249125 which basketball
sw2227A-ms98-a-0055 216.249125 218.035500 college or
sw2227A-ms98-a-0056 218.035500 219.044250 [silence]
sw2227A-ms98-a-0057 219.044250 222.326000 well we got we got two teams of the ACC going there
sw2227A-ms98-a-0058 222.326000 224.710000 we got Duke and North Carolina
sw2227A-ms98-a-0059 224.710000 229.416750 but i mean the i mean there's nothing to do like for example yesterday
sw2227A-ms98-a-0060 229.416750 233.410125 uh they go s[ome]- some girl goes do you dares want to go to a picnic right
sw2227A-ms98-a-0061 233.410125 244.789375 i hear no we're just you know it's like we just woke up we had a hangover and everything you know and so we just woke up and uh we're watching TV and i go no today we're just going to dedicate ourselves to watching golf
sw2227A-ms98-a-0062 244.789375 256.750250 and bowling you know and everybody was like it was like oh God do you guys really watch that no you know i was like a whole golf tournament it's like for example baseball i hate baseball i mean
sw2227A-ms98-a-0063 256.750250 263.765000 somebody told me like that like you can watch baseball and the actual play time that there is is five minutes
sw2227A-ms98-a-0064 263.765000 273.882125 because by the play time is when the person when the pitcher pitches the ball and it goes to the catcher or when the when the pitcher pitches and it's hit
sw2227A-ms98-a-0065 273.882125 277.909750 okay and that takes like you know five seconds for the whole play 
sw2227A-ms98-a-0066 277.909750 286.680125 and that's it [laughter-it] i mean maybe a home run could last a little bit longer because the guy has to run around all the bases you know but i mean it's it's like that i mean it's was it's just 
sw2227A-ms98-a-0067 286.680125 295.809375 but when i went home that's all like they had on TV so i had to i watched entire games of baseball and they're going oh my God and TV in Argentina's really bad
sw2227A-ms98-a-0068 295.809375 297.515750 [silence]
sw2227A-ms98-a-0069 297.515750 301.141500 uh because um i wanted to go to school here
