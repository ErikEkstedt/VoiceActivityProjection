sw2202A-ms98-a-0106 394.896500 399.378625 but uh if you if you miss it at the right time of the day then you're okay
sw2202A-ms98-a-0107 399.378625 409.580125 but it always seemed like when i was there i was always finishing i lived in Duluth which is uh north of Atlanta well not north it's more east
sw2202A-ms98-a-0108 409.580125 412.660625 uh along I eighty five
sw2202A-ms98-a-0109 412.660625 421.500250 and i would always be on the other end of two eighty five having to go all the way around two eighty five and then onto eighty five to go home and it was always at the end of the day
sw2202A-ms98-a-0110 421.500250 424.979750 i never managed to plan my departure right

sw2202A-ms98-a-0144 514.995875 520.748500 couple of years ago i was thinking about moving to Massachusetts but uh boy i'm glad i didn't
sw2202A-ms98-a-0145 520.748500 523.643500 because it's really going downhill up there
sw2202A-ms98-a-0146 523.643500 528.536000 [silence]
sw2202A-ms98-a-0147 528.536000 536.165250 well you know i- i was when when the big boom was going on i was thinking well Dukakis must be an absolute genius
sw2202A-ms98-a-0148 536.165250 544.836375 and then i- i- i really think that all of that was just you know temporary growth and everything to make him look good for the Presidential election
sw2202A-ms98-a-0149 544.836375 547.716500 because it certainly wasn't sustained
sw2202A-ms98-a-0150 547.716500 555.881250 [silence]
sw2202A-ms98-a-0151 555.881250 557.000250 well
sw2202A-ms98-a-0152 557.000250 564.463125 yeah but on the other hand if it if it needed his personal intervention all the time then it wasn't a good system anyway
sw2202A-ms98-a-0153 564.463125 568.055625 you know it should it should have been rolling right along without him
sw2202A-ms98-a-0154 568.055625 572.397250 you know good a good chief executive would be able to sit back and not do anything
sw2202A-ms98-a-0155 572.397250 573.703750 hopefully
sw2202A-ms98-a-0156 573.703750 576.957500 [silence]
sw2202A-ms98-a-0157 576.957500 584.661125 no that's true and and and Lord knows with that legislature up there they probably did all kinds of things while he wasn't looking
sw2202A-ms98-a-0158 584.661125 585.870250 so
sw2202A-ms98-a-0159 585.870250 587.573375 [silence]
sw2202A-ms98-a-0160 587.573375 589.791875 [laughter-yeah] well you can't
sw2202A-ms98-a-0161 589.791875 592.259250 you can't trust legislators anyway
sw2202A-ms98-a-0162 592.259250 594.636375 [noise]
sw2202A-ms98-a-0163 594.636375 598.477750 yeah we n[eed]- we didn't talk too much about music but we had a good conversation
