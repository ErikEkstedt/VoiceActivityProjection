sw2297A-ms98-a-0024 78.021500 85.861625 yeah yeah i know i've got a a similar problem i used to work uh believe it or not repairing cars about uh twenty years ago
sw2297A-ms98-a-0025 85.861625 93.701750 and uh didn't think of anything about doing my own repair work and uh i about twenty years ago i i got a real job
sw2297A-ms98-a-0026 93.701750 106.589875 and [laughter] i've been doing it ever since and i've been away from it for so long now when i decided to do something to my car i couldn't uh my first experience was uh try to do something with the uh the exhaust system on my car
sw2297A-ms98-a-0027 106.589875 114.498000 uh try to work out in the driveway it's kind of cool outside no lifts so you had to work with a car jacked up and up up on blocks
sw2297A-ms98-a-0028 114.498000 125.002625 uh pulling the pipes apart not having the right equipment uh because i knew what right equipment i needed because i used to work in a garage i didn't have any pipe spreaders or chisels uh designed to do that
sw2297A-ms98-a-0029 125.002625 131.055000 and it would take me two or three times longer than it normally would to to you know to get the professional to do it 
sw2297A-ms98-a-0030 131.055000 136.145000 so i started so i started taking my car to the garage and uh i had a little squeak
sw2297A-ms98-a-0031 136.145000 143.954250 in fact it was about a year ago uh when i applied my foot on the brakes and i i been experiencing this squeak for quite a while
sw2297A-ms98-a-0032 143.954250 147.570250 so i stopped at one of these speedy muffler places uh
sw2297A-ms98-a-0033 147.570250 151.823125 so they have them_1 look at my wheel bearing because my wheel bearing needed grease
sw2297A-ms98-a-0034 151.823125 156.896625 and uh after waiting a half an hour to get on the lift i uh
sw2297A-ms98-a-0035 156.896625 163.161125 i was there and he pulled the first wheel off the one that i said that was squeaking and uh he said the bearing looks good
sw2297A-ms98-a-0036 163.161125 170.887375 so he pulled the other left front wheel off and he says uh i think i've got a problem and he says i said what's that he says your brakes are no good
sw2297A-ms98-a-0037 170.887375 176.307000 so he s[ays]- says want me to pull the back off i says no and [laughter-so] he pulled them_1 off anyway [laughter]
sw2297A-ms98-a-0038 176.307000 177.339125 [laughter]
sw2297A-ms98-a-0039 177.339125 181.288500 so then he says uh-huh you need you need brakes on the front you need brakes on the back
sw2297A-ms98-a-0040 181.288500 187.537500 i said well jeez you know i only stopped here to get a wheel bearing put in and i says i didn't uh you know i didn't have uh
sw2297A-ms98-a-0041 187.537500 191.087250 slightest idea i needed brakes so he says well
sw2297A-ms98-a-0042 191.087250 193.287750 [silence]
sw2297A-ms98-a-0043 193.287750 194.328125 um-hum

sw2297A-ms98-a-0049 225.506125 227.044750 oh so i[t]-
sw2297A-ms98-a-0050 227.044750 229.100750 it was a continuous squeal
sw2297A-ms98-a-0051 229.100750 233.379875 [silence]
sw2297A-ms98-a-0052 233.379875 235.459750 right what the
sw2297A-ms98-a-0053 235.459750 245.749500 yeah this is evidently it's a new technology that uh that came about after i worked in my garage twenty years ago they didn't have such a thing but what what they've got now is like a little metal tab
sw2297A-ms98-a-0054 245.749500 249.001125 that uh that that that is designed to squeak
sw2297A-ms98-a-0055 249.001125 258.298000 when uh you know before the thing that they used to use was uh if once your let me see once the pad reached the level of the rivet head
sw2297A-ms98-a-0056 258.298000 263.366625 then that was time to to change your brakes unfortunately you couldn't see it until you pulled the wheel off
sw2297A-ms98-a-0057 263.366625 269.449750 so they they needed an audible method of defining when brakes were needed so they came up with that
sw2297A-ms98-a-0058 269.449750 272.885000 but i didn't finish telling you my s[tory]- uh my story that was only the beginning
sw2297A-ms98-a-0059 272.885000 278.248875 after he pulled all my four wheels off he says you're going to need new brakes so uh
sw2297A-ms98-a-0060 278.248875 284.570000 i says well what is that going to cost so he said well let me figure it out so he says uh well probably a couple hundred dollars
sw2297A-ms98-a-0061 284.570000 296.611750 so i says well i said that isn't too bad i said why don't you go ahead and do it so he i says but give me give me an esti[mate]- a written estimate so he went around and he says well your back drum is no good i can't turn it down because it's oversize
sw2297A-ms98-a-0062 296.611750 304.945000 and you need new this and you need new that and he come up with a bill of seven hundred and forty eight dollars i've got a [laughter] i've got a Cadillac
sw2297A-ms98-a-0063 304.945000 306.498125 [laughter] so
sw2297A-ms98-a-0064 306.498125 311.355375 so i says no i says i don't want to do it i said put it back together he says i don't know if i can [laughter]
sw2297A-ms98-a-0065 311.355375 320.491125 [laughter-so] i'm stuck over there i've got my car all apart and he's telling me he doesn't know if he can put it back together again i says well i came in here with a car with four wheels on i said i'm going to leave with four wheels
sw2297A-ms98-a-0066 320.491125 326.550125 so he says well why do you want to put it all back together again if you know you need brakes because_1 he showed me and i did in fact need brakes
sw2297A-ms98-a-0067 326.550125 335.827750 and i was going to do it myself and i just you know it it i shuddered uh because_1 everytime i try to work on my car l[ately]- lately i don't have all the right tools and it ends up taking my twice as long
sw2297A-ms98-a-0068 335.827750 344.374250 so then he turned around and says i can give you a fifteen or ten percent discount if you do it now so i says okay so it ended up costing me almost six hundred almost seven hundred dollars
sw2297A-ms98-a-0069 344.374250 347.098375 for that complete brake and i just stopped for a squeak
sw2297A-ms98-a-0070 347.098375 349.216875 [laughter]
sw2297A-ms98-a-0071 349.216875 354.999625 [silence]
sw2297A-ms98-a-0072 354.999625 360.120875 the the place that i've been going to because i own a Cadillac you can't go to a garage you have to go to a dealer 
sw2297A-ms98-a-0073 360.120875 368.232125 uh they charge thirty six to forty five dollars an hour and uh i had trouble with my fan on my blower
sw2297A-ms98-a-0074 368.232125 373.760000 it my my high speed wouldn't would not work my low speed blower would work but my high speed wouldn't
sw2297A-ms98-a-0075 373.760000 381.974500 so i says i'm not even going to i'm not even going to try it i said i'm going to take it right down there and tell the guy to put it in so i uh i went down i picked it up
sw2297A-ms98-a-0076 381.974500 385.136250 picked up the car when it was all done and i says well how much is it
sw2297A-ms98-a-0077 385.136250 393.360125 and the part came to i don't know twenty seven dollars and the labor came to s[omething]- something like fifteen dollars
sw2297A-ms98-a-0078 393.360125 402.784500 which is unusual because i never get out of that place for for less than two hundred so i'm saying to myself if he only charged me fifteen dollars that meant that he only worked on it for [laughter-about] twenty minutes
sw2297A-ms98-a-0079 402.784500 408.094125 and and i said just for the heck of it i want to open up the the hood to see what he worked on
sw2297A-ms98-a-0080 408.094125 416.125375 honest to God the the blower a a two year old could have changed it it was right on top i didn't even bother looking because inside my car looks like uh
sw2297A-ms98-a-0081 416.125375 425.213750 all tubes and wires and vacuums and hoses and and this blower is sitting right on top of [laughter-everything] and it was only two little screws holding it down
sw2297A-ms98-a-0082 425.213750 430.503500 so it took him about five minutes and he charged me a half an hour's worth of labor to to put
sw2297A-ms98-a-0083 430.503500 431.985500 [silence]
sw2297A-ms98-a-0084 431.985500 436.639250 no evidently they uh they gave me a half hour minimum is what they charged me 
sw2297A-ms98-a-0085 436.639250 437.804750 [silence]
