sw2222A-ms98-a-0049 157.068750 160.997375 [silence]
sw2222A-ms98-a-0050 160.997375 170.455625 we usually don't uh we usually don't have very cold weather down here you know during uh during football season it it gets colder later on in the season
sw2222A-ms98-a-0051 170.455625 173.512125 but it takes a good while for it to get cold
sw2222A-ms98-a-0052 173.512125 180.581750 but couple couple Christmases ago we had a a freak storm
sw2222A-ms98-a-0053 180.581750 185.557000 and i live near the coast actually i live like right on the coast of North Carolina
sw2222A-ms98-a-0054 185.557000 199.118625 and uh what they they called it like a winter hurricane and so instead of bringing high winds and destruction and rain it just brought a lot of snow and basically it rain it it snowed only on the coast but not inland
sw2222A-ms98-a-0055 199.118625 208.851125 so the coast was completely [vocalized-noise] we had like ten foot snow drifts which in the coast we barely get an inch of snow a year 
sw2222A-ms98-a-0056 208.851125 214.626125 yeah and so we you know because being near the water we get less snow than anybody else
sw2222A-ms98-a-0057 214.626125 220.967500 and this time we had a bunch of snow we we i had fun playing in in the snow playing football in the snow
sw2222A-ms98-a-0058 220.967500 231.019625 and so i mean i- i had never done that before and it's it's so much fun because you can hit harder and land harder and it doesn't matter because it's snow and yeah
sw2222A-ms98-a-0059 231.019625 239.659000 [silence]
sw2222A-ms98-a-0060 239.659000 243.601500 yeah well we had like layers of clothing to keep away the snow
sw2222A-ms98-a-0061 243.601500 245.027125 yeah
sw2222A-ms98-a-0062 245.027125 255.042125 but the snow also helps you know and it it we had like one foot deep snow in this in this open field and so it was a little hard to run but when you got hit and you fell you didn't really feel it
sw2222A-ms98-a-0063 255.042125 264.252000 you just felt the hit of the person but when you hit the ground it was you know just snow it was it was pretty fun but it's it's a lot better to play it in the cold weather that's true
sw2222A-ms98-a-0064 264.252000 269.065250 [silence]
sw2222A-ms98-a-0065 269.065250 278.504000 well right now we're having nice weather i- i probably say in in the upper sixties maybe lower seventies right now
