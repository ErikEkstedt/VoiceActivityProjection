sw2233B-ms98-a-0002 1.066000 3.997625 so what do you think of uh public schools today

sw2233B-ms98-a-0006 21.018500 22.888375 so they can't decide

sw2233B-ms98-a-0008 34.898250 36.562000 um

sw2233B-ms98-a-0012 41.983500 45.236375 and and and the restriction is it sort of
sw2233B-ms98-a-0013 45.236375 51.365125 sort of scr[ewing]- screwing around with whoever is getting what money to what school
sw2233B-ms98-a-0014 51.365125 57.246125 yeah [noise] we actually don't have we have we're having some problems of our own up here with teachers
sw2233B-ms98-a-0015 57.246125 62.965625 but um we are we are apparently i'm i'm fairly new to Rochester i've only been here a cou[ple]- a few years
sw2233B-ms98-a-0016 62.965625 68.191125 and we are supposedly Rochester public schools are are one of the model
sw2233B-ms98-a-0017 68.191125 72.046000 the city schools are some of the models for the rest of the country
sw2233B-ms98-a-0018 72.046000 75.100875 they have very specific programs that um
sw2233B-ms98-a-0019 75.100875 78.794500 that are being implemented at the moment that everybody is watching
sw2233B-ms98-a-0020 78.794500 82.900125 you know to make sure that they're all they're all working and uh
sw2233B-ms98-a-0021 82.900125 87.152125 for instance they have a mentor teacher program where um
sw2233B-ms98-a-0022 87.152125 94.896000 there are teachers who take a year off or so and gets to go around and and help other teachers learn how to teach
sw2233B-ms98-a-0023 94.896000 98.754875 and things like that but they're having a lot of problems here because um
sw2233B-ms98-a-0024 98.754875 103.523375 because they also pay the teachers i think much better than others places in the country
sw2233B-ms98-a-0025 103.523375 105.847375 [silence]
sw2233B-ms98-a-0026 105.847375 107.832125 they they pay them well
sw2233B-ms98-a-0027 107.832125 109.426375 [silence]
sw2233B-ms98-a-0028 109.426375 116.740375 oh yeah they there they pay them a little better here i think than most than than than than the national average especially these mentor teachers
sw2233B-ms98-a-0029 116.740375 124.162500 but they're having a large problem negotiating contracts they have been in con[tract]- they have been without a contract i believe for over six months
sw2233B-ms98-a-0030 124.162500 126.156500 or something like six months
sw2233B-ms98-a-0031 126.156500 133.893875 and they are now putting in you know some sort of federal arbitrator i think or something because they just have a horrible time getting the
sw2233B-ms98-a-0032 133.893875 136.607250 you know getting their contracts straightened out
sw2233B-ms98-a-0033 136.607250 144.406500 they have been good and they only walked out once or twice i believe they keep getting you know they th[ey]- they'll go all the way to your table they'll have some proposal and then
sw2233B-ms98-a-0034 144.406500 149.904875 someone won't like it for some reason or some of them will say vote it down and it just goes
sw2233B-ms98-a-0035 149.904875 151.182875 but
sw2233B-ms98-a-0036 151.182875 169.571125 [silence]
sw2233B-ms98-a-0037 169.571125 171.796500 yeah so that that's [vocalized-noise]
sw2233B-ms98-a-0038 171.796500 176.045000 that that's always i'm i'm actually i'm a PhD student at the moment
sw2233B-ms98-a-0039 176.045000 179.418500 and um it's always occurred to me that that um
sw2233B-ms98-a-0040 179.418500 183.505250 you know i mean so looking at it s[o]- all so i have some bias in this
sw2233B-ms98-a-0041 183.505250 186.966000 but it but it's always seemed to me that that that those people who
sw2233B-ms98-a-0042 186.966000 196.969000 should be paid the most i think or paid sig[nificantly]- you know significantly more are are teacher types because they sort of hold more of the future in our hands than almost anyone else yet
sw2233B-ms98-a-0043 196.969000 200.758625 yet i don't think that uh it it it's being done
sw2233B-ms98-a-0044 200.758625 207.364000 i also i mean in general i think that our educational system is okay but i think we're lacking in some very specific areas
sw2233B-ms98-a-0045 207.364000 210.036500 that that need to be worked on i will
sw2233B-ms98-a-0046 210.036500 219.368250 [silence]
sw2233B-ms98-a-0047 219.368250 220.779250 yeah
sw2233B-ms98-a-0048 220.779250 223.748250 how wha[t]- do what do you mean by that
sw2233B-ms98-a-0049 223.748250 228.541875 [silence]
sw2233B-ms98-a-0050 228.541875 230.262500 oh yeah
sw2233B-ms98-a-0051 230.262500 231.919000 [silence]
sw2233B-ms98-a-0052 231.919000 233.241250 um-hum
sw2233B-ms98-a-0053 233.241250 247.011625 [silence]
sw2233B-ms98-a-0054 247.011625 248.914500 that's true that's true
sw2233B-ms98-a-0055 248.914500 250.004125 [silence]
sw2233B-ms98-a-0056 250.004125 251.703875 but well i think that
sw2233B-ms98-a-0057 251.703875 257.081375 [silence]
sw2233B-ms98-a-0058 257.081375 262.598500 yeah i think actually in any there are some places where some teachers are just afraid to teach you know are they going to
sw2233B-ms98-a-0059 262.598500 268.517125 or they go to work where they're just baby sitters i think rather than teachers you know they're job is to make sure that
sw2233B-ms98-a-0060 268.517125 271.491000 no kids get killed in their classroom for that day and
sw2233B-ms98-a-0061 271.491000 274.788625 nobody else get's out so it's hard to imagine a
sw2233B-ms98-a-0062 274.788625 281.351250 you know i mean i- i- i can't imagine teaching in a situation like that and actually trying to get anything across to a student
sw2233B-ms98-a-0063 281.351250 286.233875 i'd be more concerned about getting myself out alive at the end of the day and just being happy
sw2233B-ms98-a-0064 286.233875 293.073625 so i- i sit back that the that's one of the main things that sort of happens to be sure up you know in or educational system maybe
sw2233B-ms98-a-0065 293.073625 296.068125 [laughter] do that means you have to have a
sw2233B-ms98-a-0066 296.068125 299.717625 metal detector and and uh outside the school or something
sw2233B-ms98-a-0067 299.717625 300.963375 i'm not sure
sw2233B-ms98-a-0068 300.963375 315.489250 [silence]
sw2233B-ms98-a-0069 315.489250 318.750000 well possibly i think it does um
sw2233B-ms98-a-0070 318.750000 321.959125 i'm not sure i think it does some uh
sw2233B-ms98-a-0071 321.959125 326.114750 it it it it may sort of lead to some
sw2233B-ms98-a-0072 326.114750 334.831625 uh it it it may just be another form of sort of regimenting you know in kids which i which i think is good actually to have some kids sort of sit together and
sw2233B-ms98-a-0073 334.831625 339.036500 you know just say things and sort of do things together so possibly
sw2233B-ms98-a-0074 339.036500 341.240875 possibly i think that um
sw2233B-ms98-a-0075 341.240875 347.457000 uh i'm i'm i'm actually Jewish so i suspect that i would be more in favor of sort of nonsectarian sort of prayer
sw2233B-ms98-a-0076 347.457000 353.942250 in school but i think some things might be a a wise idea just to give kids more of an authoritarian sort of view
sw2233B-ms98-a-0077 353.942250 356.523000 i think a lot of kids are having a problem with that today
sw2233B-ms98-a-0078 356.523000 360.106625 i w[ould]- would i would agree with you and uh
sw2233B-ms98-a-0079 360.106625 361.976500 i think somewhat
sw2233B-ms98-a-0080 361.976500 366.465375 although i do understand the issue of separation of church and state somewhat so i
sw2233B-ms98-a-0081 366.465375 367.844625 so
sw2233B-ms98-a-0082 367.844625 369.173500 [silence]
sw2233B-ms98-a-0083 369.173500 371.532125 i don't know how you resolve that you know
sw2233B-ms98-a-0084 371.532125 376.536750 i also i mean i think that our i think that our schools look a lot worse nowadays
sw2233B-ms98-a-0085 376.536750 383.679875 relative to schools sort of in other countries as well i mean sort of like compared to the Japanese school system
sw2233B-ms98-a-0086 383.679875 391.696375 i was in a panel that would that addressed the issue of you know science and how our kids they're just very very far behind in science because
sw2233B-ms98-a-0087 391.696375 398.211250 a lot of them_1 just aren't going into it because they just don't know anything about it and how it's got to be upgraded now is all
sw2233B-ms98-a-0088 398.211250 404.630375 [silence]
sw2233B-ms98-a-0089 404.630375 408.754625 [noise] i think so [vocalized-noise] you i- i- i read a little bit on that that that sounds interesting 
sw2233B-ms98-a-0090 408.754625 420.503000 [silence]
sw2233B-ms98-a-0091 420.503000 423.249500 oh well hopefully they'll resolve it soon
sw2233B-ms98-a-0092 423.249500 452.681625 [silence]
sw2233B-ms98-a-0093 452.681625 455.248125 well i hope it all works out
sw2233B-ms98-a-0094 455.248125 462.875625 yeah i- i- i have i mean you say that your your kids are grown up and out of school now and i've yet to have any so [laughter]
sw2233B-ms98-a-0095 462.875625 465.653875 so [laughter] i'm not quite at home with the issues yet
sw2233B-ms98-a-0096 465.653875 469.121000 but i'm sure i'll it will hit me a little harder in a couple of years
sw2233B-ms98-a-0097 469.121000 482.158750 [silence]
sw2233B-ms98-a-0098 482.158750 484.693500 oh i can't even i can't imagine it
sw2233B-ms98-a-0099 484.693500 485.967750 [laughter]
sw2233B-ms98-a-0100 485.967750 487.625250 [silence]
sw2233B-ms98-a-0101 487.625250 493.193625 my only hope is that uh is that whatever i'm going to wined of being college faculty somewhere i think
sw2233B-ms98-a-0102 493.193625 499.031375 and my and my only hope is that um whatever kids we have want to go to school wherever i teach
sw2233B-ms98-a-0103 499.031375 502.581000 because that typically is very otherwise i can't imagine it
sw2233B-ms98-a-0104 502.581000 503.608125 it would
sw2233B-ms98-a-0105 503.608125 508.413625 [silence]
sw2233B-ms98-a-0106 508.413625 510.048500 no i
sw2233B-ms98-a-0107 510.048500 513.373750 [silence]
sw2233B-ms98-a-0108 513.373750 519.039250 i- i don't i it completely beyond me i went to my under graduate uh education
sw2233B-ms98-a-0109 519.039250 526.382375 um on a lot of financial aid and where i am now i'm i'm only in graduate school because they waive tuition and
sw2233B-ms98-a-0110 526.382375 529.596375 they pay for school a little bit otherwise i would never
sw2233B-ms98-a-0111 529.596375 531.315375 be comfortable again
sw2233B-ms98-a-0112 531.315375 540.391625 [silence]
sw2233B-ms98-a-0113 540.391625 547.393750 well they give some some financial aid for education they they advertise that they give it you can earn up to ten or twenty thousand dollars for
sw2233B-ms98-a-0114 547.393750 558.101625 [silence]
sw2233B-ms98-a-0115 558.101625 563.454750 that's that's actually a great way i think i know i have lots of friends who are doing things like that
sw2233B-ms98-a-0116 563.454750 568.597000 i think it's a great way i couldn't i'm actually deaf in one ear so they wouldn't take me
sw2233B-ms98-a-0117 568.597000 577.385000 um but that is a real a real i mean that's a real good way to do it i think i think that you know [vocalized-noise] these people are sort of getting the money and doing something for it so
sw2233B-ms98-a-0118 577.385000 579.041125 i think it's real good
sw2233B-ms98-a-0119 579.041125 580.251500 [silence]
sw2233B-ms98-a-0120 580.251500 583.199375 anyway it's it's been it was nice meeting you
