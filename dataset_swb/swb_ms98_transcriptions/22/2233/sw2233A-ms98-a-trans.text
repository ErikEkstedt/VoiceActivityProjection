sw2233A-ms98-a-0042 208.431375 212.230375 i think one thing too that's hurting the teachers
sw2233A-ms98-a-0043 212.230375 215.787000 as far as recruiting teachers is that the uh
sw2233A-ms98-a-0044 215.787000 219.114000 they've lost a lot of their their authority
sw2233A-ms98-a-0045 219.114000 220.913500 in the classroom
sw2233A-ms98-a-0046 220.913500 223.306250 [vocalized-noise]
sw2233A-ms98-a-0047 223.306250 226.006375 well i mean uh they
sw2233A-ms98-a-0048 226.006375 228.992375 no more punishment per se
sw2233A-ms98-a-0049 228.992375 232.526125 i i'm speaking mostly of elementary

sw2233A-ms98-a-0051 234.245375 235.771250 you know it's
sw2233A-ms98-a-0052 235.771250 237.841750 if some if a teacher
sw2233A-ms98-a-0053 237.841750 243.147250 does anything that uh they're liable to have a law suit against them for
sw2233A-ms98-a-0054 243.147250 247.171125 for uh cruel and unjust punishment or whatever

sw2233A-ms98-a-0094 436.469750 442.338875 and the city council is divided over what the district should be because_1
sw2233A-ms98-a-0095 442.338875 448.997250 they divide it one way and the minorities say we're losing representation [vocalized-noise] representation
