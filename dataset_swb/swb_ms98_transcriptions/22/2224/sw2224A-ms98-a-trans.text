sw2224A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.709375 [noise]
sw2224A-ms98-a-0002 0.709375 7.291375 okay pro football i like two teams one the New York Giants and the second is the Raiders
sw2224A-ms98-a-0003 7.291375 11.301375 that's right across the country i don't think i could [laughter] i don't think i could
sw2224A-ms98-a-0004 11.301375 17.748500 i don't think i could spread my patriotism any more than well actually i like uh San Francisco 49ers too but uh
sw2224A-ms98-a-0005 17.748500 23.172000 yeah uh i'm surprised being that being from Dallas i thought you'd be a Dallas fan
sw2224A-ms98-a-0006 23.172000 24.753125 oh i see
sw2224A-ms98-a-0007 24.753125 28.277000 [silence]
sw2224A-ms98-a-0008 28.277000 29.670250 uh-huh
sw2224A-ms98-a-0009 29.670250 32.020250 [silence]
sw2224A-ms98-a-0010 32.020250 40.041000 i liked uh the Cowboys i lived in in West Texas in Abilene i worked with TI in Abilene for ten years and i really enjoyed watching the Cowboys play and they
sw2224A-ms98-a-0011 40.041000 51.533625 they went through a rebuilding thing down there and and and uh i watched them go downhill like all the teams do you know like Pittsburgh did like the New York Giants did like like i think the 49ers are about to do
sw2224A-ms98-a-0012 51.533625 56.687375 i think the the players get a little old and get a little tired and uh
sw2224A-ms98-a-0013 56.687375 61.999250 [silence]
sw2224A-ms98-a-0014 61.999250 63.275750 sure
sw2224A-ms98-a-0015 63.275750 64.397625 [silence]
sw2224A-ms98-a-0016 64.397625 73.845000 you're exactly right and and this the other teams failed to do Houston failed to do that they had Bum Phillips in there and a and a good running back i forget to uh i forget that fellow's name uh
sw2224A-ms98-a-0017 73.845000 76.558125 Campbell Earl Campbell and they run that man to death
sw2224A-ms98-a-0018 76.558125 77.872500 and
sw2224A-ms98-a-0019 77.872500 79.504500 yep but
sw2224A-ms98-a-0020 79.504500 81.804000 they had nothing to back it up and
sw2224A-ms98-a-0021 81.804000 86.066625 and uh you see that so much in pro sports we we go through this
sw2224A-ms98-a-0022 86.066625 89.421500 this rebuilding cycle without a without a backup bench and
sw2224A-ms98-a-0023 89.421500 96.705375 it's it's happened in basketball here with the Celtics and this year they finally gotten some backup support so you don't have to keep five guys out there for an hour you know
sw2224A-ms98-a-0024 96.705375 105.935375 but i like uh i like the Giants i- i kind of think they snuck into the championship this year this past year and and i'm not so sure [laughter] they'll get away with it again but
sw2224A-ms98-a-0025 105.935375 106.941875 [silence]
sw2224A-ms98-a-0026 106.941875 109.720750 they they kind of pulled it off this year but i like
sw2224A-ms98-a-0027 109.720750 111.131500 [silence]
sw2224A-ms98-a-0028 111.131500 112.453250 yes
sw2224A-ms98-a-0029 112.453250 113.565250 yes
sw2224A-ms98-a-0030 113.565250 120.075500 i think the whole thing of how they got there was to me i- i kind of well i- i guess that's the rules and
sw2224A-ms98-a-0031 120.075500 123.861750 and the way the and the way the the play-offs are run but i
sw2224A-ms98-a-0032 123.861750 129.685375 i don't know i just think there was probably some other teams that they only missed by couple of points and they really should have been in there but
sw2224A-ms98-a-0033 129.685375 137.817250 i like the Giants because of uh Bill Parcells and i like him as a coach and he's he's been for years a a good coach i- i think
sw2224A-ms98-a-0034 137.817250 141.587000 i'm not sure that they can repeat okay
sw2224A-ms98-a-0035 141.587000 142.770125 [silence]
sw2224A-ms98-a-0036 142.770125 144.619750 yeah yeah
sw2224A-ms98-a-0037 144.619750 150.538250 [silence]
sw2224A-ms98-a-0038 150.538250 151.657375 no
sw2224A-ms98-a-0039 151.657375 160.462750 [silence]
sw2224A-ms98-a-0040 160.462750 164.133375 no i don't think they'll be able to carry it that far uh
sw2224A-ms98-a-0041 164.133375 165.655000 [silence]
sw2224A-ms98-a-0042 165.655000 174.714125 who who would you if you had your pick out of anyone of the league teams who would you say is going to be the new new uh Super Bowl champions this year for ninety one
sw2224A-ms98-a-0043 174.714125 176.317000 [silence]
sw2224A-ms98-a-0044 176.317000 179.707875 that kind of that kind of put you out on a limb a little bit i guess
sw2224A-ms98-a-0045 179.707875 188.278750 [silence]
sw2224A-ms98-a-0046 188.278750 197.849500 i thought i thought for sure that Buffalo was going to be in there this past year i really did and i w[ould]- that would be my choice that would be my choice again this year
sw2224A-ms98-a-0047 197.849500 202.775250 because with Kelly at quarterback when he went down hurt they brought another young fellow in there
sw2224A-ms98-a-0048 202.775250 210.076875 yeah Reicher or whate[ver]- Reicher whatever his name is and boy he they never even missed a beat i mean they just kept right on pouncing
sw2224A-ms98-a-0049 210.076875 216.560125 and if it weren't for the tumble of the ball Buffalo would have been there this year and and to me that's another super team course
sw2224A-ms98-a-0050 216.560125 220.847125 i'm being up here in the northeast corner i kind of like these northeast teams [laughter]
sw2224A-ms98-a-0051 220.847125 230.712000 course i used to like the Patriots too they were just down the road from here but boy the Patriots are kind of sad they're now they're talking of moving out of town and they ought to all get out of town and take Kiam with them_1
sw2224A-ms98-a-0052 230.712000 232.407375 [silence]
sw2224A-ms98-a-0053 232.407375 234.632000 but uh yeah they they really
sw2224A-ms98-a-0054 234.632000 241.969375 i think they hurt the sport this year with all that controversy over that locker room incident with uh with uh all that the reporter and stuff and
sw2224A-ms98-a-0055 241.969375 248.109500 i think they just could have handled it more professionally i- i- i believe that they they hurt themselves i guess
sw2224A-ms98-a-0056 248.109500 260.001000 they've had a lot of trouble with uh with the Sullivan boys and Kiam they didn't really see eye to eye and of course the the big political football up here you know now they're now they're trying to move the team somewhere else the last i heard
sw2224A-ms98-a-0057 260.001000 261.462875 boy just kind of [laughter]
sw2224A-ms98-a-0058 261.462875 268.442625 i've been a Patriot fan for years and years and you know when you when they're only like thirty miles from where you live you can get to see the games once in a while and
sw2224A-ms98-a-0059 268.442625 276.466500 it's just a shame you keep going there and like week after week and every week you come away a loser i mean y[ou]- after a while guys get tired and we just didn't go anymore so
sw2224A-ms98-a-0060 276.466500 280.947750 [silence]
sw2224A-ms98-a-0061 280.947750 282.845250 yeah sure
sw2224A-ms98-a-0062 282.845250 284.374500 [silence]
sw2224A-ms98-a-0063 284.374500 287.813375 but they played like professionals exactly right
sw2224A-ms98-a-0064 287.813375 289.661875 [silence]
sw2224A-ms98-a-0065 289.661875 290.807750 yeah
sw2224A-ms98-a-0066 290.807750 292.405875 [silence]
sw2224A-ms98-a-0067 292.405875 301.188750 yeah they they really didn't do good at all for [laughter-us] [laughter-up] [laughter-here] and that's that's too bad because they were they were some good play[ers]- they are some good players on the Patriots team you know and
sw2224A-ms98-a-0068 301.188750 310.492625 i think they need to get rid of Grogan he's been around too long they need to put him in the front office doing management or something but they need to get him off the field and and get the manager
sw2224A-ms98-a-0069 310.492625 312.519375 he is eventually
sw2224A-ms98-a-0070 312.519375 313.655375 [silence]
sw2224A-ms98-a-0071 313.655375 315.250125 because he's been
sw2224A-ms98-a-0072 315.250125 323.736125 he's been hurt so many times and he's not as agile these young fellows they just take advantage of that and and and though they don't show it and say it and do it intentionally
sw2224A-ms98-a-0073 323.736125 326.824375 it's just their strength will beat him you know sometimes
sw2224A-ms98-a-0074 326.824375 332.984625 [silence]
sw2224A-ms98-a-0075 332.984625 336.594875 sure of course no one does i'm sure they don't you know it was
sw2224A-ms98-a-0076 336.594875 349.492750 that that would be and the other thing is they're going to be there in that same position one of these days you know and hopefully they like Bo Jackson now as i understand has hurt himself in both baseball and football he he's there's question as to whether he's going to come back i haven't read today's paper
sw2224A-ms98-a-0077 349.492750 354.907750 [silence]
sw2224A-ms98-a-0078 354.907750 358.748750 is that right there's a there's a fabulous career
sw2224A-ms98-a-0079 358.748750 368.922875 [silence]
sw2224A-ms98-a-0080 368.922875 372.511250 oh sure because they're they're tenure is [laughter-real] [laughter-short]
sw2224A-ms98-a-0081 372.511250 379.728375 anytime at all yeah but ye[ah]- yeah he may come back into baseball but i doubt if he'll ever come back and play [vocalized-noise]
sw2224A-ms98-a-0082 379.728375 391.792875 [silence]
sw2224A-ms98-a-0083 391.792875 398.640875 well i would have too i that's the s[ame]- that's that's i don't understand that obvious i think football is much more strenuous than baseball
sw2224A-ms98-a-0084 398.640875 403.751250 you get a chance to sit down in baseball every once in a while you know if you're not up for three innings or whatever but
sw2224A-ms98-a-0085 403.751250 406.955500 yeah [laughter-the] [laughter-key] [laughter-right] [laughter-there] [laughter-yeah]
sw2224A-ms98-a-0086 406.955500 415.558875 some some big fellows not out there trying to stomp you into the ground you know i mean but uh i- th[at]- that's surprising i- i was i had not heard that in the in the
sw2224A-ms98-a-0087 415.558875 416.766250 yeah they
sw2224A-ms98-a-0088 416.766250 429.207250 no i'm i'm sure they p[robably]- well it all depends i guess on on what they feel is you know what he can do because_1 baseball is not a light an easy sport either that's a very very athletic sport lot of running and stuff like that and the hip
sw2224A-ms98-a-0089 429.207250 435.408250 may be a real problem but i- i would think that football would have been more of a detriment to him than than baseball would
sw2224A-ms98-a-0090 435.408250 440.819000 [silence]
sw2224A-ms98-a-0091 440.819000 446.366375 well Steve i'll tell you i think i still think Joe Montana's the best quarterback that ever handled a ball
sw2224A-ms98-a-0092 446.366375 454.487000 and Terry Bradshaw i think is probably even better than he is or better or w[as]- was better than than Joe Montana is now
sw2224A-ms98-a-0093 454.487000 463.281125 because_1 i of course [laughter] another another Steeler fan showing up here you know another black and yellow surfacing up here you know [laughter] this is the black and blue league up here in the corner
sw2224A-ms98-a-0094 463.281125 474.533000 but i like Bradshaw as a quarterback and i think uh Joe Montana's probably one of the finest and John Elway i believe that fellow if he had some different people in front of him
sw2224A-ms98-a-0095 474.533000 476.755125 he would be on par with
sw2224A-ms98-a-0096 476.755125 478.841375 with Joe Montana
sw2224A-ms98-a-0097 478.841375 487.649750 because i really think that Denver did not do much for Elway and his career except make him look bad on times when he really should not have looked that bad
sw2224A-ms98-a-0098 487.649750 491.593375 [silence]
sw2224A-ms98-a-0099 491.593375 498.463875 yeah that's a fact i like John Elway i think he was a fab[ulous]- he he still is he's got a he's got a lot of years left in him
sw2224A-ms98-a-0100 498.463875 499.757125 [silence]
sw2224A-ms98-a-0101 499.757125 509.544500 no i don't believe so i don't believe he's going to be able to get the job done in Denver he's going to run up some big numbers and stuff but i don't believe he's going to get the job done there because Den[ver]- simply because Denver is not not the
sw2224A-ms98-a-0102 509.544500 515.418500 doesn't have enough depth i don't think to support him like like Joe Montana got supported with the 49ers
sw2224A-ms98-a-0103 515.418500 520.935750 [silence]
sw2224A-ms98-a-0104 520.935750 523.551375 yeah that's that could be true too
sw2224A-ms98-a-0105 523.551375 526.258250 [silence]
sw2224A-ms98-a-0106 526.258250 531.298875 yeah yeah that in-fighting can really destroy a team and its ability to win
sw2224A-ms98-a-0107 531.298875 532.620500 yeah pardon me
sw2224A-ms98-a-0108 532.620500 533.651750 [silence]
sw2224A-ms98-a-0109 533.651750 540.530750 oh it certainly did it most certainly did yeah we as i say we went through the Sullivans uh that that owned the team you know and and owned the stadium and 
sw2224A-ms98-a-0110 540.530750 547.675500 it's unreal the in-fighting it was it was just it's every day in the paper was like you know it was like a saga like a like a 
sw2224A-ms98-a-0111 547.675500 556.465500 like a soap opera it you know who's fighting with who who doesn't want to go out on the field who doesn't want to catch it's unreal i mean you know that that's really detrimental to the team
sw2224A-ms98-a-0112 556.465500 559.059250 well Steve it's been nice talking with you
sw2224A-ms98-a-0113 559.059250 566.101500 it sure has and i i'd like to try this thing every once in a while i thought i'd give it a try this afternoon being so rainy i'm locked in up here anyway so
sw2224A-ms98-a-0114 566.101500 573.186250 well like i say i- i guess i'll root for any football game because i really like the sport and i'm glad that was my topic today so
sw2224A-ms98-a-0115 573.186250 580.410750 you uh you uh take care of yourself and if you're ever up this way to TI in Attleboro look me up my name's Ray Smith and i work in building twelve
sw2224A-ms98-a-0116 580.410750 582.868000 okay come on up bye-bye
sw2224A-ms98-a-0117 582.868000 584.490875 [noise]
