sw2275B-ms98-a-0011 41.120750 47.962000 it's funny that those are my two hu[sband's]- my husband's two favorite shows too and i enjoy both watching both of them but i used to didn't like Night Court
sw2275B-ms98-a-0012 47.962000 53.424375 and i and the only reason i think i like it now is because_1 i've seen it so much now i'm involved with the characters but
sw2275B-ms98-a-0013 53.424375 55.341375 i used to think um
sw2275B-ms98-a-0014 55.341375 64.840750 Dan Fielding was just too too vulgar and too crude for me [laughter] and and i told my husband that's the whole point but [laughter] i i just it's
sw2275B-ms98-a-0015 64.840750 68.660000 i find him degrading at times and i guess that is the point but sometimes it just

sw2275B-ms98-a-0021 101.983375 106.418375 i i think it adds a probably adds a little bit of depth to his character i haven't watched um
sw2275B-ms98-a-0022 106.418375 118.743000 i think uh yeah i think so [laughter] which in Quantum Leap you get even though the the person is involved in so many other people's lives you still see a a real person in those situations he gets
sw2275B-ms98-a-0023 118.743000 126.564875 um he's doing amazing things but he's doing them within the bounds of what of normal person would do and i think that's i like that
sw2275B-ms98-a-0024 126.564875 128.744000 [silence]
sw2275B-ms98-a-0025 128.744000 135.503250 um i think my favorite show is Hunter and i i like the old ser[ies]- series better when um
sw2275B-ms98-a-0026 135.503250 137.596500 Deedee was in there yes
sw2275B-ms98-a-0027 137.596500 143.086250 and um so uh and then the the blonde that they took out the one that got killed
sw2275B-ms98-a-0028 143.086250 151.910500 yeah i didn't enjoy her i i she was too much of a opposite of Deedee and i think that's what they try to do but i think we wanted to see Deedee there or somebody like her

sw2275B-ms98-a-0041 207.220375 213.791000 and i like the new lady better but i'd just as soon that they didn't have the romance there i'd just as soon have the the police story without all the romance

sw2275B-ms98-a-0043 216.324875 223.840000 yeah i think most shows were doing that and then they went away from it and now they're starting to go back to it and maybe that's what the public wants i don't know but i just
sw2275B-ms98-a-0044 223.840000 228.420000 i like the the cut and dry solve the mystery and that's what i always enjoyed about it

sw2275B-ms98-a-0079 373.501000 378.092250 i i'm guess it's go[ing]- falling back into our traditional stereotypes which a lot of shows
sw2275B-ms98-a-0080 378.092250 384.533125 yeah which kind of like in the big soap opera shows which i don't enjoy because of that

sw2275B-ms98-a-0089 416.017250 418.750250 yeah it's funny how we uh
sw2275B-ms98-a-0090 418.750250 425.398500 we we romanticize people uh like w[ell]- for instance when i was a teenager you know you romance uh 
sw2275B-ms98-a-0091 425.398500 431.360000 romanticize a rock star but when he gets married then you don't care anymore or something like that and i think it's the same with your characters on TV
