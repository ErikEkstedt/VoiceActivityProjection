sw2275A-ms98-a-0002 1.140000 4.891375 okay well i can tell you pretty much my two favorite shows
sw2275A-ms98-a-0003 4.891375 10.840750 and they kind of are in different spectrums i think um one of them's Quantum Leap
sw2275A-ms98-a-0004 10.840750 21.502250 and the other one is Night Court and i think i think they're real different i mean i don't think they have anything in common uh Quantum Leap has i mean Quantum Leap is kind of
sw2275A-ms98-a-0005 21.502250 34.193000 a comedy in its own way i guess but uh mostly it's it's kind of science fiction and it's um adventure and things like that um and then Night Court is just pure you know weird fun you know just
sw2275A-ms98-a-0006 34.193000 41.781750 it's it's nothing serious about it at all so i don't know why the two of them_1 happen to be my two favorite shows but they that's the way it is so

sw2275A-ms98-a-0016 62.082250 64.140625 yeah that's right i mean
sw2275A-ms98-a-0017 64.140625 68.563250 [silence]
sw2275A-ms98-a-0018 68.563250 81.459250 well they they really have changed him though if if you've watched it this season um he's becoming i mean he still is in his own way degrading and everything but uh he's involved in that charity
sw2275A-ms98-a-0019 81.459250 87.609625 and uh it's taking up so much of his time and so much of his thought that he really has in fact there was one show
sw2275A-ms98-a-0020 87.609625 96.752625 that he even turned down a date with some you know beautiful woman just because the idea that he was his mind was on the ozone layer and you know global warming and all this other kind of stuff
sw2275A-ms98-a-0021 96.752625 102.740375 and he you know was too depressed you know to so that was part of i guess his character building or whatever but
sw2275A-ms98-a-0022 102.740375 106.406250 [silence]
sw2275A-ms98-a-0023 106.406250 109.607875 which of course he needed [laughter]

sw2275A-ms98-a-0027 123.901375 125.899875 right right that's that's good point
sw2275A-ms98-a-0028 125.899875 127.060000 [silence]
sw2275A-ms98-a-0029 127.060000 129.176000 so what do you what do you consider your favorite shows though
sw2275A-ms98-a-0030 129.176000 131.514250 [silence]
sw2275A-ms98-a-0031 131.514250 132.448750 okay_1
sw2275A-ms98-a-0032 132.448750 135.226875 [silence]
sw2275A-ms98-a-0033 135.226875 136.490625 Deedee
sw2275A-ms98-a-0034 136.490625 138.177875 yeah i agree
sw2275A-ms98-a-0035 138.177875 141.794000 [silence]
sw2275A-ms98-a-0036 141.794000 144.412250 yeah i can't remember what her name is but uh
sw2275A-ms98-a-0037 144.412250 150.338500 [silence]
sw2275A-ms98-a-0038 150.338500 159.995250 um-hum well but see i read an article about uh in TV Guide about uh about Hunter and about his l[atest]- you know latest you know his three girls whatever you want to call them_1
sw2275A-ms98-a-0039 159.995250 173.789125 and they say that uh that there was abso[lutely]- that there was like a a conflict between her and him uh that they never really could get her into uh any character that they could use i mean you know uh
sw2275A-ms98-a-0040 173.789125 181.726500 yeah the second one the blonde uh you know if you think about it they didn't really interact hardly at all i mean they were never partners
sw2275A-ms98-a-0041 181.726500 182.856375 yeah
sw2275A-ms98-a-0042 182.856375 184.264750 [silence]
sw2275A-ms98-a-0043 184.264750 188.119875 a[nd]- uh and and even even at the beginning Deedee and and Hunter
sw2275A-ms98-a-0044 188.119875 195.880625 would decide that one of them_1 would go do this while the other one would do would go this but uh it seemed like it was almost two different organizations
sw2275A-ms98-a-0045 195.880625 204.810000 you know like like Hunter was the boss and and this other girl was not and you know you kind of you're wondering you know well when did this happen you know
sw2275A-ms98-a-0046 204.810000 207.262625 so yeah i i i kind of agree with that
sw2275A-ms98-a-0047 207.262625 213.255625 [silence]
sw2275A-ms98-a-0048 213.255625 217.067875 well i'm afraid that's what they they really wanted to do um
sw2275A-ms98-a-0049 217.067875 219.734500 [silence]
sw2275A-ms98-a-0050 219.734500 220.440875 um-hum
sw2275A-ms98-a-0051 220.440875 228.300375 [silence]
sw2275A-ms98-a-0052 228.300375 241.308375 yeah well see there was that spark between Deedee and Hunter for a while but they they like started it and then they'd pull it back and they'd start it and pull it back and that really made it a very interesting
sw2275A-ms98-a-0053 241.308375 245.241750 uh show to where you never really knew
sw2275A-ms98-a-0054 245.241750 254.522375 which which one was going to show up you know whether it was going to where they're going to be real close or whether they're just going to be partners you know and that that i kind of thought was good but um
sw2275A-ms98-a-0055 254.522375 266.024000 you know it's i[t]- i guess you know you always kind of sit there and you see these two people together and you always wonder why they don't you know get together or whatever and so i guess that's what they decide to do
sw2275A-ms98-a-0056 266.024000 267.232500 yeah
sw2275A-ms98-a-0057 267.232500 268.293500 [silence]
sw2275A-ms98-a-0058 268.293500 276.043250 but it's it's always been a formula uh for TV that the minute that two people that the two main stars get married
sw2275A-ms98-a-0059 276.043250 279.030625 that the show ends up w[ell]- you know dying
sw2275A-ms98-a-0060 279.030625 285.758375 a a good example of this and uh you know this is uh probab[ly]- well maybe it's not a good [laughter-example] i've been watching
sw2275A-ms98-a-0061 285.758375 299.373625 Nickelodeon all last week uh because they had uh what they called Maximum Smart they had Get Smart for uh ten hours a day from seven o'clock at night -[un]til six or -[un]til five o'clock the next morning
sw2275A-ms98-a-0062 299.373625 314.096375 all the Get Smart episodes you could ever see well the the last day all they did was the last season to where the two of them_1 got married and that was i mean that was the killer the series died right after that because well go ahead
sw2275A-ms98-a-0063 314.096375 316.125125 [silence]
sw2275A-ms98-a-0064 316.125125 317.985625 um-hum the same thing
sw2275A-ms98-a-0065 317.985625 321.112625 [silence]
sw2275A-ms98-a-0066 321.112625 333.742000 yeah the i[t]- i[t]- it seems like you can do so much more of the subtle hints and the subtle little plays on things before they they before they get married you know the minute they get married everything's supposed to be cut and dried and
sw2275A-ms98-a-0067 333.742000 341.715500 and well of course another one of their mistakes i think is they have a tendency to change characters or to change the character's uh
sw2275A-ms98-a-0068 341.715500 347.548625 uh personalities um um well especially after they get married um
sw2275A-ms98-a-0069 347.548625 357.170125 couple of examples would be um well like i said this one about uh Max or Get Well Smart uh the female character uh Barbara Feldon
sw2275A-ms98-a-0070 357.170125 365.193125 she had been at the beginning the the intelligent one the the one who ev[eryone]- always solved the things and and figured out and kept
sw2275A-ms98-a-0071 365.193125 369.892625 Max from getting real messed up well tow[ard]- whenever they got married she got dingy
sw2275A-ms98-a-0072 369.892625 371.598000 you know why would they do that
sw2275A-ms98-a-0073 371.598000 373.140000 it it made no sense
sw2275A-ms98-a-0074 373.140000 376.287500 [silence]
sw2275A-ms98-a-0075 376.287500 377.479500 [laughter-yeah]
sw2275A-ms98-a-0076 377.479500 379.490500 unfortunately that's probably true
sw2275A-ms98-a-0077 379.490500 382.223500 [silence]
sw2275A-ms98-a-0078 382.223500 382.975500 um-hum
sw2275A-ms98-a-0079 382.975500 385.040000 [silence]
sw2275A-ms98-a-0080 385.040000 386.983125 well do you watch um
sw2275A-ms98-a-0081 386.983125 389.520875 what is that show uh Who's the Boss
sw2275A-ms98-a-0082 389.520875 391.836500 it's uh that's on Tuesday nights i think
sw2275A-ms98-a-0083 391.836500 393.796125 [silence]
sw2275A-ms98-a-0084 393.796125 404.451125 yeah the well i yeah i hardly ever watch it but uh as as i've seen it they've they've done sort of the same thing to where they've they started to let them_1 get together and then they pulled them_1 apart
sw2275A-ms98-a-0085 404.451125 416.407750 and i think they're thinking about that exact thing about the idea that if the show lets them uh get together then you lose part of what the show's all about so i always thought that was kind of weird
sw2275A-ms98-a-0086 416.407750 421.288750 [silence]
sw2275A-ms98-a-0087 421.288750 422.370000 um-hum

sw2275A-ms98-a-0090 429.544875 431.367625 [silence]
sw2275A-ms98-a-0091 431.367625 437.947375 well do you think that's why most rock stars nowadays keep their marriages a secret or at least they keep it quiet
sw2275A-ms98-a-0092 437.947375 439.764375 yeah i mean
sw2275A-ms98-a-0093 439.764375 441.552875 [silence]
sw2275A-ms98-a-0094 441.552875 442.732625 yeah
sw2275A-ms98-a-0095 442.732625 448.338250 now like Madonna and Sean Penn now i don't particularly like either one of them_1 but um
sw2275A-ms98-a-0096 448.338250 451.696250 uh their marriage was so highly publicized
sw2275A-ms98-a-0097 451.696250 454.045375 that there was no way that they could stay together
sw2275A-ms98-a-0098 454.045375 456.197750 uh or at least that's the way i look at it
sw2275A-ms98-a-0099 456.197750 457.561375 so i don't know
sw2275A-ms98-a-0100 457.561375 459.110125 [laughter-yeah] i would think so
sw2275A-ms98-a-0101 459.110125 464.603750 [silence]
