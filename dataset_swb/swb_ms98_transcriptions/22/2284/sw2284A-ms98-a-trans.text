sw2284A-ms98-a-0015 51.495250 55.582750 yeah see i feel like i don't know i feel like the
sw2284A-ms98-a-0016 55.582750 66.102375 motivation Bush is a member of the Trilateral Commission and he's a member he was a member of the Skull and Bones at i think at Princeton or Yale i'm not Yale
sw2284A-ms98-a-0017 66.102375 76.898250 and uh his motivations are i don't feel like he was absolutely on the up and up with us on you know the mot[ivation]- the true motivation he talks a lot about the new world order
sw2284A-ms98-a-0018 76.898250 89.497875 and most Americans probably don't really know what that would mean and i maybe i'm being maybe i'm assuming too m[uch]- no i don't think most would i really don't and so i feel like the real motivation was something that
sw2284A-ms98-a-0019 89.497875 102.637875 uh most people would have absolutely no idea and that that motivation is to um you know to establish a one world order and to break up the monopoly power of the Middle East will
sw2284A-ms98-a-0020 102.637875 115.683375 so that they will submit under the uh one world order [laughter] i mean that's what i felt so i'm like going hum am i glad we went over there and did that um i think God's ultimately in charge and
sw2284A-ms98-a-0021 115.683375 125.277500 you know i'm not afraid of what they've done i'm not afraid of Saddam Hussein i feel he's lost and you know he needs to get [laughter-saved] just like the everybody else but
sw2284A-ms98-a-0022 125.277500 139.908625 you know i just i guess i have kind of like hum kind of real cautious in the whole thing because i know that there's a motive that hasn't been openly discussed or revealed to anybody and uh that's where that's why i really don't have a real
sw2284A-ms98-a-0023 139.908625 150.855375 set opinion because i don't know everything i don't mu[ch]- you could watch news all the time but you don't know anything hardly and he did talk about that though he did uh he at least he did mention it 
sw2284A-ms98-a-0024 150.855375 156.586500 you know what i'm saying i don't think most people understand what he's talking about when he talks about that new world order
sw2284A-ms98-a-0025 156.586500 159.629125 so i don't know what do you think of that

sw2284A-ms98-a-0039 211.656750 216.558875 [silence]
sw2284A-ms98-a-0040 216.558875 223.320625 um-hum but the motivation though see wasn't didn't have anything i don't believe it had anything to do with the oil because
sw2284A-ms98-a-0041 223.320625 230.806250 i think i i feel like the r[eal]- the real motivation of the war was to break up that Arab power not
sw2284A-ms98-a-0042 230.806250 242.852750 to disperse the oil but to they were a big problem for the the unifying of the EEC the European Economic Community which are gonna become i- i- i mean they're gonna be
sw2284A-ms98-a-0043 242.852750 249.919125 they're gonna put us under if we don't become part of the new world order next year the United States if we don't
sw2284A-ms98-a-0044 249.919125 259.343750 i mean we're going to be in big trouble because when Europe u[nites]- unites that's why TI's building plants in Italy because_1 they're going to have power like we can't imagine
sw2284A-ms98-a-0045 259.343750 263.105125 and so the i think Bush wanted to break up this other power thing
sw2284A-ms98-a-0046 263.105125 265.438875 and it looks real good but in the end
sw2284A-ms98-a-0047 265.438875 277.699875 i just see that ultimately who's going to be in charge of this one world order you know what i mean is is George Bush really any better than Saddam Hussein or does he just look better do you know what i'm saying i mean i think one person
sw2284A-ms98-a-0048 277.699875 292.525750 in power that's not really seeking God and wanting to do good for the people and not deal for selfish motives is very dangerous and i don't see that this one world this new world order that him and Gorbachev keep talking about i just don't see that um
sw2284A-ms98-a-0049 292.525750 305.547375 that's just a real good thing but i think it's something that's going to happen but i guess that's what i feel happen with the war and that was the motive of the war was to try and break that up and so that they could be you know
sw2284A-ms98-a-0050 305.547375 307.989000 get more power over that Arab
sw2284A-ms98-a-0051 307.989000 315.152375 lands when they try and next year really start pushing this new world order well he talks about it all the time i mean
sw2284A-ms98-a-0052 315.152375 324.094500 i mean that's all he talks about but anyway there's a good book by Larry Abraham um you probably have heard of None Dare Call It Treason and Call it Conspiracy
sw2284A-ms98-a-0053 324.094500 336.154250 well anyway Call it Conspiracy is a real good book and he talks a lot about this i've heard him interviewed some so i think it's kind of interesting but anyway he probably has a new book out that i don't know about yet because_1 i haven't heard him [laughter-in] a while but
sw2284A-ms98-a-0054 336.154250 345.742250 i don't know so that's kind of my thing on the war i'm kind of like nah [laughter] it's all power plays you know there's so much stuff going on we don't know about
sw2284A-ms98-a-0055 345.742250 349.863000 you know i'm like going hey Peter Jennings you know he knows a little bit but
sw2284A-ms98-a-0056 349.863000 351.687875 he doesn't e[ven]- [laughter]
sw2284A-ms98-a-0057 351.687875 361.235375 i mean we would all die if we knew what was really going on i mean all of America would probably go into coronary attack [laughter] well they would
sw2284A-ms98-a-0058 361.235375 368.031125 oh my money's in the stock market oh i can't believe they're doing this but it doesn't change anything so i'm just like 
sw2284A-ms98-a-0059 368.031125 377.131000 i don't know just i mean i would pr[obably]- most people probably think i don't even have a high school education you know because of my attitude about it but i just feel like there's so much going on
sw2284A-ms98-a-0060 377.131000 386.538875 that you know hey i'm going to pray about it and [laughter] if i feel led to vote for a certain person i'm [laughter-going] to do it but i'm not going to get all up tight about all this
sw2284A-ms98-a-0061 386.538875 398.989875 and stuff you know hum-um because_1 i know at first we were watching the news a lot and man it was like go[sh]- we were like [noise] all the time and i thought gee you know God's going to protect Israel i mean he starts
sw2284A-ms98-a-0062 398.989875 411.970500 he starts nuking Israel man he's in big trouble i mean we'll just we'll hear about it you know what i mean [laughter] if anything major happens we're going to find out so let's chill out and just do what we need to do so
sw2284A-ms98-a-0063 411.970500 413.519375 [silence]
sw2284A-ms98-a-0064 413.519375 414.942125 um-hum
sw2284A-ms98-a-0065 414.942125 418.206250 [silence]
sw2284A-ms98-a-0066 418.206250 428.518875 i know it was kind of exciting at first but and then i know the first night of the bombing we had it was a Wednesday and we had home church and we had a surprise birthday party planned for a sixteen year old [laughter]
sw2284A-ms98-a-0067 428.518875 436.376125 and so when we [laughter] you know we're on the way to home church and the bombing's just begun you know and we go into this birthday party for a surprise party
sw2284A-ms98-a-0068 436.376125 445.494250 and so it was you know we just went from one extreme to the other you know and it was like kind of s[ad]- it was like man this is really hard you know i want to watch the war and so [laughter]
sw2284A-ms98-a-0069 445.494250 451.668000 so imagine the sixteen year old yep boy i had a surprise birthday party and a war started in Israel 
sw2284A-ms98-a-0070 451.668000 454.825000 that'll be a good story when she's thirty won't it
sw2284A-ms98-a-0071 454.825000 458.359625 w[ell]- well anyway well i guess do you think we're finished
sw2284A-ms98-a-0072 458.359625 469.524750 i think so too i don't know if we did what we were supposed to but [laughter] yeah we did they can do a lot of resear[ch]- we get along good too some of the callers you don't along with that good you know you have you know what i'm saying
sw2284A-ms98-a-0073 469.524750 473.178750 isn't that funny i bet they're going to do a lot of research on that
sw2284A-ms98-a-0074 473.178750 474.649375 i know
sw2284A-ms98-a-0075 474.649375 479.262625 [silence]
