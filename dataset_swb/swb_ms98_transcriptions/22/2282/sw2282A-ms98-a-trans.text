sw2282A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.177875 [noise]
sw2282A-ms98-a-0002 0.177875 2.494125 do you believe in uh capital punishment
sw2282A-ms98-a-0003 2.494125 10.979625 [silence]
sw2282A-ms98-a-0004 10.979625 13.276125 uh-huh [laughter]
sw2282A-ms98-a-0005 13.276125 15.992750 [silence]
sw2282A-ms98-a-0006 15.992750 17.490500 yeah
sw2282A-ms98-a-0007 17.490500 30.990375 [silence]
sw2282A-ms98-a-0008 30.990375 41.274125 yeah well i think uh that based on um certain crimes it uh is merited uh there was a case just recently i don't know if you uh if you heard about this in uh New Hampshire i believe
sw2282A-ms98-a-0009 41.274125 50.987250 about the uh teacher school teacher who hired her uh one of her high school students to kill her husband and they found her guilty and gave her life with no parole
sw2282A-ms98-a-0010 50.987250 59.497375 and in a case like that uh where well you've got [laughter] a moral problem and an economic one uh
sw2282A-ms98-a-0011 59.497375 71.717500 when when she's going to be in prison for the rest of her life with no chance of parole ah what good does it do anybody and the taxpayers are going to be footing the bill for the rest of her life she's a young young woman uh in her late twenties i guess
sw2282A-ms98-a-0012 71.717500 73.754250 so i just
sw2282A-ms98-a-0013 73.754250 76.490875 early twen[ties]- well i could be yeah
sw2282A-ms98-a-0014 76.490875 79.985625 [silence]
sw2282A-ms98-a-0015 79.985625 86.714875 um i don't know i didn't hear that much about it uh just the uh the verdict that they had
sw2282A-ms98-a-0016 86.714875 96.261125 [silence]
sw2282A-ms98-a-0017 96.261125 101.978250 um i don['t]- i don't really know about that uh uh
sw2282A-ms98-a-0018 101.978250 113.185000 if well uh i thi[nk]- i think it's it's only uh it only applies to ce[rtain]- a very few types of crimes uh murder and i think kidnapping could carry death penalty as well
sw2282A-ms98-a-0019 113.185000 118.984000 i'm not sure what ho[w]- what the range is for uh for the crimes that uh would merit a death penalty
sw2282A-ms98-a-0020 118.984000 125.721125 [silence]
sw2282A-ms98-a-0021 125.721125 136.485000 uh i think it depends on what what it was they did and if the evidence was uh uh if there was no doubt in my mind that that person was guilty of that crime
sw2282A-ms98-a-0022 136.485000 149.180375 and if they were uh if if [laughter] if i had no doubt that uh they would be a a hazard to to the rest of uh the population as long as they were alive uh yeah i could probably go along with that
sw2282A-ms98-a-0023 149.180375 164.465000 [silence]
sw2282A-ms98-a-0024 164.465000 172.773375 well [laughter] i guess you've got a choice either you do life in prison or you can institutionalize somebody forever uh where they're not a threat to
sw2282A-ms98-a-0025 172.773375 181.469250 to the rest of uh the population or or you can put them_1 out of everybody's misery uh i don't know it's it's a real moral dilemma
sw2282A-ms98-a-0026 181.469250 186.750375 i mean i come from the Catholic church and [laughter] they they uh are definitely opposed
sw2282A-ms98-a-0027 186.750375 188.497750 to that type of
sw2282A-ms98-a-0028 188.497750 190.494750 um-hum
sw2282A-ms98-a-0029 190.494750 197.760125 [silence]
sw2282A-ms98-a-0030 197.760125 199.987000 right yeah
sw2282A-ms98-a-0031 199.987000 204.486500 [silence]
sw2282A-ms98-a-0032 204.486500 210.478375 when you see all the people who are convicted of these crimes and they get out of prison after a few years
sw2282A-ms98-a-0033 210.478375 217.484750 all of the sudden here they're they're uh committing the same type of crimes all over again other people are victimized what do you do about it
sw2282A-ms98-a-0034 217.484750 226.984375 [silence]
sw2282A-ms98-a-0035 226.984375 228.716000 no i never did
sw2282A-ms98-a-0036 228.716000 233.706375 [silence]
sw2282A-ms98-a-0037 233.706375 235.201375 uh-huh
sw2282A-ms98-a-0038 235.201375 239.654000 [silence]
sw2282A-ms98-a-0039 239.654000 241.270500 okay
sw2282A-ms98-a-0040 241.270500 260.485625 [silence]
sw2282A-ms98-a-0041 260.485625 261.997250 right
sw2282A-ms98-a-0042 261.997250 267.997125 [silence]
sw2282A-ms98-a-0043 267.997125 276.220375 well some people just are incorrigible and there's no way that they can ever deal with society and abide by rules
sw2282A-ms98-a-0044 276.220375 289.487625 so in in a case like that uh given what crime they're guilty of uh yeah i could uh i could justify a death penalty for somebody who just has no chance of ever reforming or coming to grips with uh living in normal society 
sw2282A-ms98-a-0045 289.487625 295.998250 [silence]
sw2282A-ms98-a-0046 295.998250 299.778500 um yeah i believe so
sw2282A-ms98-a-0047 299.778500 304.996250 [silence]
sw2282A-ms98-a-0048 304.996250 311.248125 well people who tend to be say on death row th[ey]- i think they're kept in isolation all the time
sw2282A-ms98-a-0049 311.248125 317.244125 i don't believe that they're given a chance to uh do anything productive or even uh mix with the rest of the prison community
sw2282A-ms98-a-0050 317.244125 325.646625 [silence]
sw2282A-ms98-a-0051 325.646625 338.949875 right well [laughter] it's it's it's real small but uh like i said i mean the death penalty could probably be justified if if the evidence if there's no doubt no i never have
sw2282A-ms98-a-0052 338.949875 344.998500 [silence]
sw2282A-ms98-a-0053 344.998500 349.783000 i know several people at work who've been called on juries and they absolutely hate it
sw2282A-ms98-a-0054 349.783000 360.745250 [silence]
sw2282A-ms98-a-0055 360.745250 374.946375 well so much of it is game playing with the lawyers they're p[lea]- doing their plea bargaining and and uh give and take type situation that uh they're playing with people's lives in effect uh by offering uh to uh
sw2282A-ms98-a-0056 374.946375 382.017375 uh offering to announce their guilt to a certain degree on a crime in order to get uh a lighter uh sen[tence]- sentence
sw2282A-ms98-a-0057 382.017375 385.291875 [silence]
sw2282A-ms98-a-0058 385.291875 387.760500 uh yeah i'm in that area uh-huh
sw2282A-ms98-a-0059 387.760500 389.799375 [silence]
sw2282A-ms98-a-0060 389.799375 394.713750 uh yes i have uh automobile uh vandalism
sw2282A-ms98-a-0061 394.713750 397.273625 [silence]
sw2282A-ms98-a-0062 397.273625 398.734375 my gosh
sw2282A-ms98-a-0063 398.734375 399.999625 [silence]
sw2282A-ms98-a-0064 399.999625 401.331625 yeah
sw2282A-ms98-a-0065 401.331625 412.694125 [silence]
sw2282A-ms98-a-0066 412.694125 414.299375 right
sw2282A-ms98-a-0067 414.299375 415.499750 [silence]
sw2282A-ms98-a-0068 415.499750 416.994500 sure
sw2282A-ms98-a-0069 416.994500 424.337500 [silence]
sw2282A-ms98-a-0070 424.337500 426.696125 yeah yeah i'd
sw2282A-ms98-a-0071 426.696125 427.963625 [silence]
sw2282A-ms98-a-0072 427.963625 431.684000 i don't have much sympathy for people that are uh
sw2282A-ms98-a-0073 431.684000 445.456000 uh victimizing others on a regular basis you know if it's a one time offense and and the kid learns his lesson and uh shows remorse and promises never to do something again and they take some steps to educate him in the matter
sw2282A-ms98-a-0074 445.456000 453.443375 uh it's it's one thing but when they're there over and over again and uh guilty of the same crimes uh nothing seems to help
sw2282A-ms98-a-0075 453.443375 465.979125 [silence]
sw2282A-ms98-a-0076 465.979125 477.998250 uh yeah well i think it depends on what the crime is uh you're not going to sentence somebody to death for stealing a car uh if it's first degree murder or uh
sw2282A-ms98-a-0077 477.998250 484.976375 [silence]
sw2282A-ms98-a-0078 484.976375 490.283750 right no something like that is just uh unforgivable
sw2282A-ms98-a-0079 490.283750 494.797125 [silence]
sw2282A-ms98-a-0080 494.797125 498.232750 yeah well [laughter] i don't know
sw2282A-ms98-a-0081 498.232750 502.996500 [silence]
sw2282A-ms98-a-0082 502.996500 504.702000 right
sw2282A-ms98-a-0083 504.702000 512.747000 [silence]
sw2282A-ms98-a-0084 512.747000 514.712000 yeah
sw2282A-ms98-a-0085 514.712000 529.431250 i think people like that when they do get put in prison with the other hard core prisoners uh the child molesters in particular are not looked on kindly by the other prisoners they don't get a lot of respect and they they probably tend not to even survive in that uh type of environment
sw2282A-ms98-a-0086 529.431250 533.977375 because_1 even in prison they have their code of ethics i guess if you can call it that
sw2282A-ms98-a-0087 533.977375 538.293000 [silence]
sw2282A-ms98-a-0088 538.293000 539.995625 sure
sw2282A-ms98-a-0089 539.995625 541.481000 w[ell]-
sw2282A-ms98-a-0090 541.481000 547.684750 yeah they don't have any really useful job skills uh lots of places no
sw2282A-ms98-a-0091 547.684750 558.994000 [silence]
sw2282A-ms98-a-0092 558.994000 560.729500 um-hum
sw2282A-ms98-a-0093 560.729500 566.719125 [silence]
sw2282A-ms98-a-0094 566.719125 568.814250 well [laughter]
sw2282A-ms98-a-0095 568.814250 573.821125 [silence]
sw2282A-ms98-a-0096 573.821125 578.998125 right you've got life without parole something like that
sw2282A-ms98-a-0097 578.998125 580.755625 [silence]
sw2282A-ms98-a-0098 580.755625 589.250875 sure well case like Charles Manson he's uh he's been eligible for parole a couple of times already his case comes up every few years now i guess
sw2282A-ms98-a-0099 589.250875 599.855875 and uh people have to uh stand up and uh denounce him again and claim that he's not fit for society but we're that close to letting people like that out of prison
