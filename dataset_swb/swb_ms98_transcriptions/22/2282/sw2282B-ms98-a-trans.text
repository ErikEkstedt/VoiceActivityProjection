sw2282B-ms98-a-0018 137.469750 149.191250 [silence]
sw2282B-ms98-a-0019 149.191250 160.884000 how about if it was uh a seventeen and a half year old with a a list and all uh of [vocalized-noise] what do they call it uh criminal [vocalized-noise]

sw2282B-ms98-a-0025 189.775375 198.980250 and always thought you know that being raised in the midwest you really didn't see any crimes really any more heinous than uh shoplifting
sw2282B-ms98-a-0026 198.980250 205.264125 and it was very easy to maintain this stand that you know that that life is something that you have no right t[o]- to take
sw2282B-ms98-a-0027 205.264125 217.702250 [silence]
sw2282B-ms98-a-0028 217.702250 219.996000 i don't know you [vocalized-noise]

sw2282B-ms98-a-0031 227.782750 240.458125 Gary Gilmore was the one who was arrested and uh found guilty of i think two or three murders in Utah Pro[vo]- outside of Provo and he was the one that was petitioning to have have you know himself executed
sw2282B-ms98-a-0032 240.458125 248.786250 when you read his book with all the interviews this guy did with Gary Gilmore you know it sounds like the guy had about every turn
sw2282B-ms98-a-0033 248.786250 261.074625 given to him every rehab opportunity given to him and even interviews with his mother she said that you know f[or]- f[or]- as a small child he's basically was amoral
sw2282B-ms98-a-0034 261.074625 269.432125 and when i finished that book i kind of thought you know what do you how do with a person like this
sw2282B-ms98-a-0035 269.432125 288.494250 [silence]
sw2282B-ms98-a-0036 288.494250 296.981000 see i would i always come look at it do they have could they be put you know even in life imprisonment could they be put to useful labor
sw2282B-ms98-a-0037 296.981000 306.017250 could they do road work and those kind of things and now [vocalized-noise] then you get somebody like Charles Manson who just even hasn't a guy around
sw2282B-ms98-a-0038 306.017250 317.722125 [silence]
sw2282B-ms98-a-0039 317.722125 326.707000 and then what do you do about the the thing that you know the the the was it one tenth of one percent chance that they might have been convicted erroneously
sw2282B-ms98-a-0040 326.707000 335.491375 [silence]
sw2282B-ms98-a-0041 335.491375 337.713750 have you ever sat on a jury
sw2282B-ms98-a-0042 337.713750 338.753500 [silence]

sw2282B-ms98-a-0044 346.255375 350.182875 [silence]
sw2282B-ms98-a-0045 350.182875 361.716625 part of me says that i'd kind of like to do it just to see what it's like to be in that position where you are playing you know life and death with somebody else could i bring myself to do it
sw2282B-ms98-a-0046 361.716625 381.483875 [silence]
sw2282B-ms98-a-0047 381.483875 386.755375 yeah have you ever lived in a in a well but Dallas is i'm is are you calling from Dallas

sw2282B-ms98-a-0049 390.777625 394.296375 [silence]
sw2282B-ms98-a-0050 394.296375 397.994375 you know when we lived in Boston i had eleven cars stolen
sw2282B-ms98-a-0051 397.994375 405.746125 yeah some of them i had for two days and you'd go to court and you'd see these kids and then an[d]-
sw2282B-ms98-a-0052 405.746125 415.972000 what they did is they usually hired kids to do this because you uh would get a you know a lighter sentence or no sentence or probation or you know something trivial and it'd be the same damn kids
sw2282B-ms98-a-0053 415.972000 429.340875 over and over and over again and the first couple of times you know i felt really sorry for them_1 but after a while it was like you know shoot the little shits right then and there and then i felt really you know guilty about feeling that way
sw2282B-ms98-a-0054 429.340875 452.452250 [silence]
sw2282B-ms98-a-0055 452.452250 466.781875 yeah yeah i you know i really don't know wh[at]- what i would do in that situation if i had to to make that judgment i think i would i think i'd be very easily swayed by fellow jurors
sw2282B-ms98-a-0056 466.781875 477.249375 [silence]
sw2282B-ms98-a-0057 477.249375 487.793875 boy if they ever catch this guy in in Richardson and Coppell who's been uh you know abducting the the young girls i don't think i'd even hesitate
sw2282B-ms98-a-0058 487.793875 489.734250 [silence]
sw2282B-ms98-a-0059 489.734250 494.987500 and then you ge[t]- you know what do you do with you know people that are you know chronic child molesters
sw2282B-ms98-a-0060 494.987500 497.140625 [silence]
sw2282B-ms98-a-0061 497.140625 499.993250 where even a psychiatrist says
sw2282B-ms98-a-0062 499.993250 509.264000 you're probably not going to change them they're always going to be you know at risk in society and and and i think you know having kids has probably really
sw2282B-ms98-a-0063 509.264000 516.932250 changed you know my thinking on this i don't know i really don't know
sw2282B-ms98-a-0064 516.932250 532.990250 [silence]
sw2282B-ms98-a-0065 532.990250 542.503125 yeah but the code of ethics that's learned in prison is s[o]- so bent and twisted that you wonder when they get out of there even if they you know claim that they're are rehabbed
sw2282B-ms98-a-0066 542.503125 544.784625 [silence]
sw2282B-ms98-a-0067 544.784625 547.465500 they don't even have social skills
sw2282B-ms98-a-0068 547.465500 548.801750 [silence]
sw2282B-ms98-a-0069 548.801750 559.508000 oh i don't know i really don't know i- i think that if somebody asked me i would hesitantly say yes that i cou[ld]- could hand down a death sentence
sw2282B-ms98-a-0070 559.508000 566.982625 uh then the big you know my big problem would be is what if you were in a in a state that absolutely did not allow it
sw2282B-ms98-a-0071 566.982625 574.992000 and you were on a jury with some heinous you know criminal who had you know just wiped out an entire family
sw2282B-ms98-a-0072 574.992000 577.774250 [silence]
sw2282B-ms98-a-0073 577.774250 581.989375 or parole in in uh fifteen twenty years
