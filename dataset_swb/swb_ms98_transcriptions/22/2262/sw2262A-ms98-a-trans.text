sw2262A-ms98-a-0011 42.472125 52.795750 well i i live out in the country so that part is good uh we're maybe one hundred miles from Pittsburgh which has a lot of pollution from their plants
sw2262A-ms98-a-0012 52.795750 60.179625 and right now in our area were fighting against a uh toxic waste incinerator 
sw2262A-ms98-a-0013 60.179625 73.894250 and uh it won't be too far from where we live and everybody's really been you know fighting against it because we just we do not want it well we don't want one any [laughter-place] 
sw2262A-ms98-a-0014 73.894250 78.876625 we would like the uh industry to do more to take care of the uh
sw2262A-ms98-a-0015 78.876625 85.028625 waste products before they turn to incineration because we feel that uh
sw2262A-ms98-a-0016 85.028625 89.811375 the small percentage that they're going to be putting into the air is too much
sw2262A-ms98-a-0017 89.811375 91.716000 you know the uh

sw2262A-ms98-a-0037 164.986000 171.138750 no and i i figure we're paying to take care of this toxic waste no matter who does it So 
sw2262A-ms98-a-0038 171.138750 182.888250 and they've shown some of the industries have been real good at uh uh doing their part in uh reducing the amount that that they have 
sw2262A-ms98-a-0039 182.888250 188.518250 uh they've reused some of it uh it can be recycled a lot of their things
sw2262A-ms98-a-0040 188.518250 194.360750 and that they've shown that it uh to begin with apparently it does cost more
sw2262A-ms98-a-0041 194.360750 206.085750 but once they get started it's really it saves them money in the end and it cuts down on the end product that has to be dealt with some other way
sw2262A-ms98-a-0042 206.085750 215.376500 and if they would all that's what that's what we want done is we want industry to take you know more responsibility in taking care of it

sw2262A-ms98-a-0047 227.826750 232.927500 they're greedy it's money is what it is it's it's the money 
sw2262A-ms98-a-0048 232.927500 239.665250 they're making fantastic amounts of money on these things and uh even the the incinerators 
sw2262A-ms98-a-0049 239.665250 244.379875 the money and the income that they're going to make off of this is 
sw2262A-ms98-a-0050 244.379875 247.123125 you know just astronomical
sw2262A-ms98-a-0051 247.123125 258.294750 [silence]
sw2262A-ms98-a-0052 258.294750 267.830750 we've never been we went as far as like uh Las Vegas [laughter] and Yellow Stone Park we we didn't go we should have gone the whole way over but we didn't 
sw2262A-ms98-a-0053 267.830750 282.209875 but i understand that we have an aunt that lives out there and when she was visiting here she would look up at the stars and [vocalized-noise] and she said how wonderful it was to be able to look into the sky and see some of the things that she saw 
sw2262A-ms98-a-0054 282.209875 285.061000 she said they couldn't see those things out there
sw2262A-ms98-a-0055 285.061000 287.912250 because of the smog and everything else

sw2262A-ms98-a-0074 347.670500 350.249375 uh older people or
sw2262A-ms98-a-0075 350.249375 353.117750 they think they're far enough away from something
sw2262A-ms98-a-0076 353.117750 366.264000 that it's and they don't realize that these things are going to affect everybody and if if you're older and it's not going to affect you that way you have grandchildren you have children uh nieces nephews whatever friends 
sw2262A-ms98-a-0077 366.264000 369.737500 uh everybody is going to be affected by it

sw2262A-ms98-a-0085 393.315000 397.267875 no we don't have uh that testing in that down here yet

sw2262A-ms98-a-0087 398.511000 405.479000 but they i have read that that that it has really helped where the problem is greater where the population is greater
sw2262A-ms98-a-0088 405.479000 408.216875 and that it has made a big difference

sw2262A-ms98-a-0106 453.055125 458.431125 yeah and like i said i think you have to pay for it no matter what you do you with it because it's industry
sw2262A-ms98-a-0107 458.431125 470.345500 we're paying industry to make the products and we're helping pay for there making these end products that are toxic waste then we have to pay for them to pay somebody to carry it away someplace
sw2262A-ms98-a-0108 470.345500 479.910875 then they put it in the dump some place and they find out well this dump doesn't work so we have to clean this up and move it someplace else We end up paying for it again
sw2262A-ms98-a-0109 479.910875 490.627375 now we're going to end up paying for it again by having it burned in these large incinerators and we're paying to have our air polluted and our water streams polluted

sw2262A-ms98-a-0111 491.699625 503.428875 or the the where they want to put the the one area they want to put the incinerator is right in the middle of the Clarion the two water sheds th[at]- that feed Clarion river 
sw2262A-ms98-a-0112 503.428875 509.015125 and [vocalized-noise] you know it just boggles our mind that they can consider even putting it there because 
sw2262A-ms98-a-0113 509.015125 516.395875 if that water gets contaminated it will go on down into Pittsburgh it will you know it it it affects so many people 
sw2262A-ms98-a-0114 516.395875 519.932750 and it's just hard to think that they could allow
sw2262A-ms98-a-0115 519.932750 522.240375 them to do things like this
sw2262A-ms98-a-0116 522.240375 525.394750 [silence]
