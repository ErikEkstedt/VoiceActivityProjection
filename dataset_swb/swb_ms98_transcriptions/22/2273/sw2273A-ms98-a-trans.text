sw2273A-ms98-a-0009 26.297375 35.493375 [silence]
sw2273A-ms98-a-0010 35.493375 36.888250 wow
sw2273A-ms98-a-0011 36.888250 40.932875 so you don't get a chance to to spend much time with him then until when he comes home
sw2273A-ms98-a-0012 40.932875 46.406375 [silence]
sw2273A-ms98-a-0013 46.406375 53.543000 wow [noise] i uh unfortunately didn't spend e[nough]- enough time with my children uh
sw2273A-ms98-a-0014 53.543000 62.726125 where i- i had a lot of things that i thought that i needed to do that were more important than than spending time with my children in fact when they were younger uh i was attending school
sw2273A-ms98-a-0015 62.726125 70.667000 and then i found myself short of cash so i uh also went in for a part-time job so by the time that i got home after my second job
sw2273A-ms98-a-0016 70.667000 81.266125 [noise] children either in bed or just getting ready to go to bed and the only time that i got to see them was on weekends and on weekends i had to do my homework so [laughter] it uh it
sw2273A-ms98-a-0017 81.266125 91.666625 you know it took away a lot of of time from them we did go out to you know to the places that you typically take children to and we had a lot of fun but it seems as though the time went by so fast that
sw2273A-ms98-a-0018 91.666625 96.930875 that i- i didn't really enjoy it as much as i could have if i worked at it a little harder
sw2273A-ms98-a-0019 96.930875 98.514500 [silence]
sw2273A-ms98-a-0020 98.514500 107.054500 it's it's unbelievable how fast you know yo[u]- when when you get to the point where even your kid's age they don't want to spend time with you anymore and you know i
sw2273A-ms98-a-0021 107.054500 121.158500 i can i can remember when my children used to beg me to go with you know even to take them to the store or take them someplace and and it just gradually goes away [laughter-until] you have to ask them do you want to come with me and then they start saying no so [laughter]
sw2273A-ms98-a-0022 121.158500 128.736375 [laughter] well i[t]- it's not sudden it's just that it probably doesn't hit the average person uh until it hits them over the head
sw2273A-ms98-a-0023 128.736375 141.822125 uh because you [vocalized-noise] because even even my oldest uh child when he comes uh comes to the house he's still he's still my my my child and and i don't think of him as an adult yet and uh that that's one of his complaints
sw2273A-ms98-a-0024 141.822125 153.438500 [silence]
sw2273A-ms98-a-0025 153.438500 155.003375 uh-huh
sw2273A-ms98-a-0026 155.003375 172.085375 [silence]
sw2273A-ms98-a-0027 172.085375 180.498375 so you had a b[unch]- a bunch of kids in the car [laughter] that must have that must have that must have been fun [laughter]

sw2273A-ms98-a-0029 186.702000 194.976500 well camping is one thing that i- i could never get used to uh i- i used to take the kids to go fishing and things like that but i never went uh never went camping
sw2273A-ms98-a-0030 194.976500 201.931125 [silence]
sw2273A-ms98-a-0031 201.931125 203.227250 yeah
sw2273A-ms98-a-0032 203.227250 206.120875 yeah up in uh New England it's uh
sw2273A-ms98-a-0033 206.120875 210.337625 uh you know three or four or five months tops after that you're in the house
sw2273A-ms98-a-0034 210.337625 217.096250 [laughter] because it becomes so cold out here that uh and sometimes the weather gets to you so you don't want to go outside and drive around
sw2273A-ms98-a-0035 217.096250 219.016500 [noise]
sw2273A-ms98-a-0036 219.016500 227.837625 [silence]
sw2273A-ms98-a-0037 227.837625 240.091875 well i can think of of some enjoyable things that that i did with the kids like we used to go up to uh New Hampshire quite a bit and go to the uh uh the White Mountains area and and visit all the you know the nature trails and things like that
sw2273A-ms98-a-0038 240.091875 252.724250 but i wouldn't sleep on the ground i went into a hotel [laughter] but i used to take the kids to uh you know the things like uh the places where there are animals and you go in and and feed the animals and things like that and uh
sw2273A-ms98-a-0039 252.724250 267.285000 yeah hey you know and the and the kids used to enjoy that as well and i like children in fact uh one of the things that i notice a dramatic change was that that uh like if i'd be in a supermarket and i'd see a cute little kid [vocalized-noise] i wouldn't think twice about patting the kid on the head
sw2273A-ms98-a-0040 267.285000 278.663875 well as time grew by and i think i had my daughter with me one time and she went strolling away and i saw this kid and i patted her on the head and the mother turned around and saw me and took the kid away [laughter] you know pulled the kid and i
sw2273A-ms98-a-0041 278.663875 291.183500 and i turned around and i realized my daughter wasn't there anymore so all she saw was a an adult standing there patting her kid on the head so i- i [laughter] i didn't realize it until after uh you know after it all happened what what the uh th[e]-
sw2273A-ms98-a-0042 291.183500 295.590000 the sort of person [vocalized-noise] uh it was uh really something
sw2273A-ms98-a-0043 295.590000 299.761500 [silence]
sw2273A-ms98-a-0044 299.761500 301.091875 uh-huh
sw2273A-ms98-a-0045 301.091875 304.457750 [silence]
sw2273A-ms98-a-0046 304.457750 306.287750 you attend a lot of their games
sw2273A-ms98-a-0047 306.287750 313.308000 [silence]
sw2273A-ms98-a-0048 313.308000 314.539625 uh-huh
sw2273A-ms98-a-0049 314.539625 324.508250 [silence]
sw2273A-ms98-a-0050 324.508250 328.563875 did you spend as much time with your daughter as you did with your sons
sw2273A-ms98-a-0051 328.563875 336.552250 [silence]
sw2273A-ms98-a-0052 336.552250 337.675375 uh-huh
sw2273A-ms98-a-0053 337.675375 346.980625 [silence]
sw2273A-ms98-a-0054 346.980625 360.127000 yeah i- i uh i felt that my[self]- myself as i as i grew older my child grew older that i realized that i didn't spend half as much time with my daughter as i did my sons because uh i'd want to do the things that i thought
sw2273A-ms98-a-0055 360.127000 373.579750 that they would like to do and it would always be the things that i wanted to do without realizing it you know things like uh you know fishing and and doing out[side]- things outside and my daughter didn't like doing those things so she ended up spending more time with her mother than uh
sw2273A-ms98-a-0056 373.579750 378.489875 than with myself and i think uh she's closer to her mother today than than she is to me because of that
sw2273A-ms98-a-0057 378.489875 382.494625 [silence]
sw2273A-ms98-a-0058 382.494625 391.497625 yeah it's unfortunate because yeah you know e[ven]- even though you you think of them as a whole family when you do things sometimes you separate them without even realizing it
sw2273A-ms98-a-0059 391.497625 395.164125 [silence]
sw2273A-ms98-a-0060 395.164125 401.958500 yeah well she was close but yet whenever i wanted to do something it was [laughter-always] something [laughter] something different than what she wanted to do
sw2273A-ms98-a-0061 401.958500 415.901875 um i spent a lot of time with her when i was home uh she'd always be the one you know sitting on my lap or being close to me and the two guys would be off uh uh playing someplace but it seems like whenever i wanted to do something like go out [noise] for the kids
sw2273A-ms98-a-0062 415.901875 424.008625 and uh she'd always say well i want to go to my girlfriend's house or i want to stay home and do this or she had like little projects she was working on at home and things like that
sw2273A-ms98-a-0063 424.008625 425.335125 [silence]
sw2273A-ms98-a-0064 425.335125 429.651000 so i- i kind of missed that um i my daughter especially uh being with her
sw2273A-ms98-a-0065 429.651000 432.010000 [silence]
sw2273A-ms98-a-0066 432.010000 437.422625 no she's the the second oldest she's uh twenty twenty three now
sw2273A-ms98-a-0067 437.422625 449.704625 [silence]
sw2273A-ms98-a-0068 449.704625 454.247625 personality traits and things like that uh no i can't say that i have
sw2273A-ms98-a-0069 454.247625 470.396000 [silence]
sw2273A-ms98-a-0070 470.396000 471.686750 uh-huh
sw2273A-ms98-a-0071 471.686750 478.619375 yeah i think you force it on them [laughter] and and the youngest one tends to be the one that's spoiled
sw2273A-ms98-a-0072 478.619375 484.528875 [silence]
sw2273A-ms98-a-0073 484.528875 490.684625 the youngest one is more sensitive that's same with my family and it's it's strange
sw2273A-ms98-a-0074 490.684625 501.721625 [laughter] well it just so happens that my youngest is uh extremely sensitive uh where my oldest one uh you know i can scream at him and yell at him and he'll look at me with with
sw2273A-ms98-a-0075 501.721625 515.894125 [laughter-but] if i say the wrong thing to my youngest son he he will he won't cry anymore because he's too old but he gets hurt he bruises very easily and and i can feel [laughter-that]

sw2273A-ms98-a-0083 552.727375 563.883750 he wanted to show his mom what he caught because it was his first fish and he wanted to put it in the bathtub [laughter-so] [laughter] she told him no he couldn't do it but he did it anyway fill the water filled the bathtub full of water and uh
sw2273A-ms98-a-0084 563.883750 577.819250 uh put the fish in it now after the fish died from being handled so much uh we brought the fish and he put it out in the swimming pool [laughter] so after he realized the fish wasn't going to come back uh to life again we went out there and they buried it
