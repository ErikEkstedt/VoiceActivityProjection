sw2243A-ms98-a-0057 202.233500 207.291125 yeah i got a whole roll of Krugerrands here would you like to buy i just made them_1 last night [laughter]
sw2243A-ms98-a-0058 207.291125 213.715125 here's a nice uh twenty dollar gold eagle uh just just manufactured in Lebanon last year [laughter]

sw2243A-ms98-a-0061 217.718375 225.342125 yeah that they they are gold they're just of course the the twenty dollar gold pieces go for coin value not the bullion value
sw2243A-ms98-a-0062 225.342125 233.255250 and amazingly enough you're you're into Middle Eastern sort of coins the the largest amount of fakes of US gold is made in Lebanon
sw2243A-ms98-a-0063 233.255250 234.548875 yeah
sw2243A-ms98-a-0064 234.548875 235.955000 [silence]
sw2243A-ms98-a-0065 235.955000 237.993250 yeah still is
sw2243A-ms98-a-0066 237.993250 241.514000 yeah that's sort of like a cottage indus[try]- industry over there
sw2243A-ms98-a-0067 241.514000 248.721000 uh and and there's some very specific things you can find you can even n[arrow]- narrow it down to where it was made
sw2243A-ms98-a-0068 248.721000 255.844250 i mean people are so aware of these things that there are certain identifying marks on there that would not be on a real one
sw2243A-ms98-a-0069 255.844250 259.567125 and uh you you can almost tell the area
sw2243A-ms98-a-0070 259.567125 262.474875 somebody probably even knows the guy who made them_1
sw2243A-ms98-a-0071 262.474875 274.281625 [silence]
sw2243A-ms98-a-0072 274.281625 284.718875 yeah well the [noise] yeah coin dealers are supposed to be smart enough not to fall for that gimmick but i i have seen a few of them_1 sell these things
sw2243A-ms98-a-0073 284.718875 292.721000 and course you have to you have to be able to prove they they knew it was counterfeit [laughter] and that's always very difficult
sw2243A-ms98-a-0074 292.721000 298.170750 [silence]
sw2243A-ms98-a-0075 298.170750 308.028000 well he can he can usually go back to the dealer but if if it's an unscrupulous dealer he'll just say hey you know you you had an opportunity to see it you know it's yours
sw2243A-ms98-a-0076 308.028000 314.198250 course you can always turn around and sell it in court and but you'd have to go in on a fraud count and that wouldn't
sw2243A-ms98-a-0077 314.198250 316.835750 fraud is very difficult to prove
sw2243A-ms98-a-0078 316.835750 317.996250 [silence]
sw2243A-ms98-a-0079 317.996250 321.708250 because_1 you have to you have to show they knowingly did it
sw2243A-ms98-a-0080 321.708250 328.128750 and that's all he's got to say is well in my in my professional judgment it was a it was a real coin
sw2243A-ms98-a-0081 328.128750 331.200125 so you know it's his word against mine
sw2243A-ms98-a-0082 331.200125 332.680000 [laughter]
sw2243A-ms98-a-0083 332.680000 337.146250 that's one of the reasons i got out of the business there was too many shenanigans going on

sw2243A-ms98-a-0088 357.434125 364.706750 yeah nowadays the the the way the uh the market is and the and the way the uh
sw2243A-ms98-a-0089 364.706750 371.679000 grading systems have changed over the last few years that's primarily what got me out of it
sw2243A-ms98-a-0090 371.679000 375.529375 they they kept changing the grading systems on coins
sw2243A-ms98-a-0091 375.529375 380.090750 and you know you go out and buy a very nice silver dollar collection
sw2243A-ms98-a-0092 380.090750 388.884000 and you've graded it at the current grade and then the next year they've changed the grading system and now these things are worth a fourth of what you paid for them_1
sw2243A-ms98-a-0093 388.884000 393.293375 you know it's just it it just go[t]- it just got ludicrous after a while 
sw2243A-ms98-a-0094 393.293375 394.573750 uh
sw2243A-ms98-a-0095 394.573750 402.467000 w[hat]- w[hat]- what the the standards for for an uncirculated silver dollar changed so many times in three years
sw2243A-ms98-a-0096 402.467000 413.947250 and a lot of people lost lots of money on that course the the persistent dealers will just sit there if they graded them_1 as M S sixty five then by golly they're M S sixty five i don't care what you say
sw2243A-ms98-a-0097 413.947250 417.199750 and they'll keep them_1 until some fool comes along and buys them_1

sw2243A-ms98-a-0104 441.854875 444.534750 Indian head pennies you know
sw2243A-ms98-a-0105 444.534750 447.475125 and they say wow you know this is really old
sw2243A-ms98-a-0106 447.475125 450.353500 yeah well it's not worth anything [laughter]
sw2243A-ms98-a-0107 450.353500 452.961125 [laughter] i'll give you a nickel for it [laughter-you] [laughter-know]
sw2243A-ms98-a-0108 452.961125 454.444125 [laughter]
sw2243A-ms98-a-0109 454.444125 462.024125 and e[ven]- even some of the rare coins that a lot of people have never even seen like um like two cent pieces
sw2243A-ms98-a-0110 462.024125 469.911000 and things like that those are not those are not even expensive i mean you can pick up very nice ones for eight nine dollars
sw2243A-ms98-a-0111 469.911000 473.761875 oh yeah yeah they're cheap they're super cheap
sw2243A-ms98-a-0112 473.761875 475.075375 um

sw2243A-ms98-a-0114 476.218125 483.883375 several i mean i[t's]- i[t's]- it it's funny the way the business works because there're so many things that are enormously out priced
sw2243A-ms98-a-0115 483.883375 485.635000 um
sw2243A-ms98-a-0116 485.635000 493.078625 some some later proof sets because they have a slight error in them_1 are are worth hundreds of dollars
sw2243A-ms98-a-0117 493.078625 499.404625 you know and and the coins themselves aren't worth very much at all face value basically
sw2243A-ms98-a-0118 499.404625 500.731625 uh
sw2243A-ms98-a-0119 500.731625 508.766875 and then of course the silver coins are more and more being traded for bullion than anything else
sw2243A-ms98-a-0120 508.766875 510.120375 uh
sw2243A-ms98-a-0121 510.120375 518.738875 you can you can buy bags of silver coins a a bag has a thousand dollars face value in it and it's traded for silver
sw2243A-ms98-a-0122 518.738875 520.384250 yeah

sw2243A-ms98-a-0124 526.907625 530.855750 no it's it's more of a uh it's a commodity purchase really
sw2243A-ms98-a-0125 530.855750 536.776000 uh it is fun though to buy these bags and go through them_1 because_1 you do find some
sw2243A-ms98-a-0126 536.776000 538.307750 some uh
sw2243A-ms98-a-0127 538.307750 544.342875 nice coins i mean people who are starting out collections and need to fill holes in their books
sw2243A-ms98-a-0128 544.342875 546.493000 can fill a whole bunch of them_1
sw2243A-ms98-a-0129 546.493000 549.670125 with these uh with these bags
sw2243A-ms98-a-0130 549.670125 555.046750 uh especially y[ou]- you want to get a mixed bag of course dimes quarters and halves
sw2243A-ms98-a-0131 555.046750 559.205125 uh but you could fill a whole bunch of uh holes with these things
sw2243A-ms98-a-0132 559.205125 564.406750 i used to i used to advertise buying wheat pennies um
sw2243A-ms98-a-0133 564.406750 569.856750 i'd give a dollar a roll which two cents a piece which is basically overpriced
sw2243A-ms98-a-0134 569.856750 579.582875 um but i used to go th[rough]- i i'd get loads and loads of these things i ended up one time with about uh a[bout]- about twelve bags of these things
sw2243A-ms98-a-0135 579.582875 585.510250 and i'd gone through all of them_1 and i found a couple of them_1 i found a nineteen O nine VDB
sw2243A-ms98-a-0136 585.510250 590.784375 and uh a um a nineteen eleven which is fairly scarce
sw2243A-ms98-a-0137 590.784375 593.330375 i found several good ones out of there
sw2243A-ms98-a-0138 593.330375 594.508250 [silence]
sw2243A-ms98-a-0139 594.508250 597.559750 people's giving it to me for two cents i uh that's okay
sw2243A-ms98-a-0140 597.559750 599.506000 turn around and sell it for fifteen dollars [laughter]
