sw2250A-ms98-a-0023 84.210625 88.139000 and so i don't i don't know firsthand of these benefits
sw2250A-ms98-a-0024 88.139000 96.405625 but i- i do agree with you that health health insurance is one of the major ones i don't know about dental i mean
sw2250A-ms98-a-0025 96.405625 101.158375 dental is is kind of like uh you know you're asking for uh too much
sw2250A-ms98-a-0026 101.158375 103.731000 to for me i think it's like uh
sw2250A-ms98-a-0027 103.731000 109.957875 you know uh you're you're expecting too much from a company if something happens it happens and they'll pay you for it but
sw2250A-ms98-a-0028 109.957875 114.098125 to actually have you know big coverage for something like that
sw2250A-ms98-a-0029 114.098125 124.356375 [silence]
sw2250A-ms98-a-0030 124.356375 126.788625 right i'm only twenty one

sw2250A-ms98-a-0034 142.338500 143.887000 right
sw2250A-ms98-a-0035 143.887000 147.905375 [silence]
sw2250A-ms98-a-0036 147.905375 149.774375 [laughter-exactly] yeah

sw2250A-ms98-a-0040 164.010500 165.481500 as health
sw2250A-ms98-a-0041 165.481500 176.938125 right so uh for a health insurance what do you think would be a uh a good health insurance with a a low deductible and a high premium or do you prefer the lower premiums with a higher deductible
sw2250A-ms98-a-0042 176.938125 199.508125 [silence]
sw2250A-ms98-a-0043 199.508125 204.003000 uh-huh i guess it also depends on how m[any]- how many times you're going to use it
sw2250A-ms98-a-0044 204.003000 227.022625 [silence]
sw2250A-ms98-a-0045 227.022625 228.039625 right

sw2250A-ms98-a-0050 240.678375 243.390500 [silence]
sw2250A-ms98-a-0051 243.390500 246.558625 too expensive more expensive for them to do that then
sw2250A-ms98-a-0052 246.558625 257.835750 [silence]
sw2250A-ms98-a-0053 257.835750 260.468250 um-hum so th[at]- that's pretty good
sw2250A-ms98-a-0054 260.468250 269.315875 [silence]
sw2250A-ms98-a-0055 269.315875 281.583875 um-hum so the so i guess that if when i get a job and i and i look into the health insurance that they're going to pay for then i should really look really really deep into the policy
sw2250A-ms98-a-0056 281.583875 282.655750 [silence]
sw2250A-ms98-a-0057 282.655750 285.484000 the very first thing i- i should look at huh
sw2250A-ms98-a-0058 285.484000 286.662625 [silence]
sw2250A-ms98-a-0059 286.662625 288.208000 no not yet

sw2250A-ms98-a-0062 292.097375 299.533625 [silence]
sw2250A-ms98-a-0063 299.533625 307.990625 what i'm really scared about and you know i'm i don't know firsthand but i it seems to me that like you were saying earlier that the deductibles are getting bigger and bigger
sw2250A-ms98-a-0064 307.990625 312.205125 and that's scary because you know in the end you're getting insurance for basically nothing
sw2250A-ms98-a-0065 312.205125 321.040500 i mean something really really really serious has happened for you you know to to make it worthwhile and then that that that that that defeats the purpose of insurance [laughter] 
sw2250A-ms98-a-0066 321.040500 329.418625 [silence]
sw2250A-ms98-a-0067 329.418625 330.605625 yeah

sw2250A-ms98-a-0070 336.792375 340.715125 that sounds like a big big asset to do that
sw2250A-ms98-a-0071 340.715125 342.187375 [silence]
sw2250A-ms98-a-0072 342.187375 344.635000 well it's been nice talking to you
