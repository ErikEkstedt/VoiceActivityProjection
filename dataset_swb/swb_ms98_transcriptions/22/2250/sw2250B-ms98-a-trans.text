sw2250B-ms98-a-0005 10.844375 16.860625 yes i'm fortunate in that i was able to take early retirement from my company last year
sw2250B-ms98-a-0006 16.860625 26.609375 and being able to do that i was able to keep my uh health insurance that the company pays for which and i had to pick up my own life insurance
sw2250B-ms98-a-0007 26.609375 32.697500 and my wife who works at the same company was able to add me to to the uh dental insurance
sw2250B-ms98-a-0008 32.697500 35.669750 so i was really fortunate i really was

sw2250B-ms98-a-0010 39.455375 42.457750 i think they will as long as they can but the problem
sw2250B-ms98-a-0011 42.457750 47.588000 obviously is the cost of health care as you know it's just going completely out of sight
sw2250B-ms98-a-0012 47.588000 52.282125 [silence]
sw2250B-ms98-a-0013 52.282125 56.558625 it is very much so it's a billion dollar problem you know every year
sw2250B-ms98-a-0014 56.558625 71.349750 uh our company had it doesn't apply to me thank goodness it applies to you know to the younger employees that they're having to pick up you know more of the uh health insurance cost you know themselves the deductibles are going up and the co-payments are going up
sw2250B-ms98-a-0015 71.349750 74.960000 and i'm concerned that's just you know the beginning of it
sw2250B-ms98-a-0016 74.960000 78.797000 [silence]
sw2250B-ms98-a-0017 78.797000 80.438375 oh yeah
sw2250B-ms98-a-0018 80.438375 82.371375 that's a problem too yeah

sw2250B-ms98-a-0030 109.906750 112.071875 [silence]
sw2250B-ms98-a-0031 112.071875 119.365500 um-hum well actually excuse me our dental insurance you know it's it's good it's certainly better than nothing it's not you know it's not super you 
sw2250B-ms98-a-0032 119.365500 126.983750 for unfortunately in my case and you sound like a younger guy so you probably don't have it you know i do have some dental problems and it's very very expensive
sw2250B-ms98-a-0033 126.983750 130.209625 and if your blessed with you know good dental 
sw2250B-ms98-a-0034 130.209625 140.594250 uh situation you are extremely lucky you really are i've had a lot of problems i still have some ongoing problems mainly because back when i was growing up
sw2250B-ms98-a-0035 140.594250 152.096750 you know we didn't know about fluoride i was raised in a small rural town in Oklahoma you only went to the dentist when your tooth actually began to hurt you know there was no such thing as preventive dentistry back then
sw2250B-ms98-a-0036 152.096750 159.829625 so the younger people you know uh are are really uh really better shaped than than people of my generation or for the most part
sw2250B-ms98-a-0037 159.829625 166.020500 but uh dental insurance is important to me it is not as important as uh as health insurance you know if i had to rank them
sw2250B-ms98-a-0038 166.020500 177.304375 [silence]
sw2250B-ms98-a-0039 177.304375 185.508750 oh gosh that's that's the general you know y[ou]- you know you almost need to know the family situation you know and you know number of kids fortunately
sw2250B-ms98-a-0040 185.508750 192.921750 i have two children and they're both grown and are covered you know under their own plans so i don't i don't have medical you know expenses for them per say
sw2250B-ms98-a-0041 192.921750 194.055250 [silence]
sw2250B-ms98-a-0042 194.055250 200.368000 uh i guess if i had to choose i would be willing to pay more you know to get to get better coverage
sw2250B-ms98-a-0043 200.368000 201.308500 now we
sw2250B-ms98-a-0044 201.308500 203.017000 [silence]
sw2250B-ms98-a-0045 203.017000 211.101000 that's right that's right and also we i say we uh i'm retired from Texas Instruments and they're just they're like most everybody el[se]- you can't just
sw2250B-ms98-a-0046 211.101000 220.980250 you don't drop into a hospital and demand you know a thousand dollars worth of tests you know or you think you need to be hospitalized but there's only a certain i mean you can go anywhere you want to go 
sw2250B-ms98-a-0047 220.980250 227.631625 but there's only approved uh health care centers you know that uh that they will pay you know the maximum amount
sw2250B-ms98-a-0048 227.631625 234.205375 if you choose to go you know you pick up the difference according to the emergency it doesn't make any difference you can you know you can go wherever you need to go
sw2250B-ms98-a-0049 234.205375 239.650125 also they were doing for a long time they were doing the company was paying for second opinions
sw2250B-ms98-a-0050 239.650125 244.799625 to doctors but they have since dropped that i guess it got to be you know not cost effective
sw2250B-ms98-a-0051 244.799625 258.535500 right so they have dropped the uh second opinion type thing but before you uh allow yourself to be admitted to the hospital you really there's a telephone number that you have to call you know and they will tell you exactly you know what they will pay for it
sw2250B-ms98-a-0052 258.535500 269.874375 and if you yeah if you want to so at least you you know you wouldn't have any surprises you can order any type of you know service you want but you stand a good chance you know having to pick up at least part of the bill yourself
sw2250B-ms98-a-0053 269.874375 276.837500 [silence]

sw2250B-ms98-a-0058 286.861625 291.331500 i see well it will become even more important you know when and if you do
sw2250B-ms98-a-0059 291.331500 300.012750 but i would really check that out because_1 i'm concerned in coming years it's going to be you know just a horrendous burden to especially the younger folks
