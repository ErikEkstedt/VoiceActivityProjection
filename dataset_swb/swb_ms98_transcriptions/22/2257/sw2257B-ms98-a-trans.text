sw2257B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 2.998000 [noise]
sw2257B-ms98-a-0002 2.998000 5.223000 i don't think we have any choice
sw2257B-ms98-a-0003 5.223000 12.998500 as long as we do it in a logical manner rather than what we did in Vietnam except jack around with it
sw2257B-ms98-a-0004 12.998500 28.495500 [silence]
sw2257B-ms98-a-0005 28.495500 42.935875 i think uh basically what we're going to have to do is now that Bush has made the made the stand is what we'll have to continue to uh stick up for our foreign policy if we don't then what's going to happen is that everybody well it's just a one time shot they're not going to do anything
sw2257B-ms98-a-0006 42.935875 49.983750 [silence]
sw2257B-ms98-a-0007 49.983750 53.985500 i don't think there's ever going to be peace in in the Middle East
sw2257B-ms98-a-0008 53.985500 62.453250 mostly it it just that that region never had had peace even as far back in biblical times it's never been peaceful 
sw2257B-ms98-a-0009 62.453250 68.437875 you know the Arabs just don't like the Jews an[d]- the Jews don't like the Arabs and then half the Arabs don't like the other Arabs
sw2257B-ms98-a-0010 68.437875 86.949750 [silence]
sw2257B-ms98-a-0011 86.949750 99.737250 no because you i- i don't think the Mideast has the educational background i- i- i don't think they're later they're rate of literacy is so low that they're still they still have a trouble mentality
sw2257B-ms98-a-0012 99.737250 101.780875 [silence]
sw2257B-ms98-a-0013 101.780875 105.992500 w[ell]- well you don't find many intelligent people starting wars you know
sw2257B-ms98-a-0014 105.992500 120.971875 you know uh basically the more intelligent people do not want to fight one uh because they've already been there all you have to do is go fight one and find out it's not much fun i've spent uh over twenty eight months in Vietnam so and i mean it's not it's not a lot of fun
sw2257B-ms98-a-0015 120.971875 128.990625 uh it's as years go by it becomes more fun now than it was twenty eight years ago you know but uh
sw2257B-ms98-a-0016 128.990625 130.315000 [silence]
sw2257B-ms98-a-0017 130.315000 145.196000 and you forget some of the smells and stuff like that but i think you know probably the probably the Middle East is if you have too many tribes mixed up with troubled mentality not only the Mideast but also in in the what they call the emergency African nations the third world
sw2257B-ms98-a-0018 145.196000 152.447875 uh [noise] as soon as one tribe gets the power they just knock off they're old ancestral enemies and it's pretty you know
sw2257B-ms98-a-0019 152.447875 154.725250 it's pretty much that way over the Mideast
sw2257B-ms98-a-0020 154.725250 160.323375 and you have the Palestinian question and there hasn't been a Palestine over there for God since you know
sw2257B-ms98-a-0021 160.323375 172.294625 two hundred years three hundred years before Christ was born and but but you have people that are suddenly coming out of the woodwork going oh yes we want a Palestine nation but there hasn't been one for you know well over two thousand years
sw2257B-ms98-a-0022 172.294625 182.287500 but you have this troubled mentality they all you know like the Kurds or the Shiite Muslims or whatever but it's basically all all based on the a a tribal network
sw2257B-ms98-a-0023 182.287500 185.710375 [silence]
sw2257B-ms98-a-0024 185.710375 195.678875 out of some degree yeah to some degree but uh religion is a factor over there but uh i think the strongest factor is a tribe of the family
sw2257B-ms98-a-0025 195.678875 206.764750 [silence]
sw2257B-ms98-a-0026 206.764750 219.265500 well they have the same problem we do y[eah]- i mean you you know everybody there's Christianity and then you then we have subdivided Baptists and Lutherans and Protestants and Christians and Catholics and stuff it's basically all the same 
sw2257B-ms98-a-0027 219.265500 227.225750 uh but but the Muslims are not as liberal in their interpretation of of the Kuran as we are in our interpretation of the Bible
sw2257B-ms98-a-0028 227.225750 228.989500 [silence]
sw2257B-ms98-a-0029 228.989500 239.217750 you get the more the more i guess you call the more militant sect of the Shiites who you know if you're not a Muslim and and you don't adh[ere]- adhere strictly to it
sw2257B-ms98-a-0030 239.217750 245.763500 then you're nothing and you're just you're you're just getting lip service much like uh the Ayatollah Khomeini
sw2257B-ms98-a-0031 245.763500 249.271125 he's a he's a prime example
sw2257B-ms98-a-0032 249.271125 250.451625 [silence]
sw2257B-ms98-a-0033 250.451625 261.967500 oh i'd i- i will but seriously doubt th[at]- that you will have peace in the Mideast as long as you have so many war infections that are they can't even agree on which facet of of uh Muslim they want to follow
sw2257B-ms98-a-0034 261.967500 274.970375 [silence]
sw2257B-ms98-a-0035 274.970375 281.977750 well we only we have two choices we can be involved or not involved if we're not involved then we're going to be sitting over here freezing in the dark
sw2257B-ms98-a-0036 281.977750 293.963250 uh we probably could with ultimate fuel supplies and uh some relaxation of our old uh policies here survive but we're not going to do that
sw2257B-ms98-a-0037 293.963250 294.995625 [silence]
sw2257B-ms98-a-0038 294.995625 308.792500 no there's there hasn't been any real you know alternating energy sit[uations]- situations or or sources played out nobody wants to do it somebody has to make the hard decision and whoever does that will be a one term president
sw2257B-ms98-a-0039 308.792500 309.972625 yeah
sw2257B-ms98-a-0040 309.972625 321.258875 it's kind of like uh Texas income tax whoever you know whoever puts that up is going to serve one term that's going to be it because_1 your going to be gone they may pass the uh state income taxes but that'll be the last thing they pass
sw2257B-ms98-a-0041 321.258875 323.474625 [silence]
sw2257B-ms98-a-0042 323.474625 330.997750 nobody actually wants to make the hard decisions [vocalized-noise] have to do is basically what we're doing now is pick some of the moderate uh Arabs or
sw2257B-ms98-a-0043 330.997750 345.215250 you know Muslims as [vocalized-noise] and uh support them because they're because they will have more uh encounter with us as far as the educational and sociological economic background goes
sw2257B-ms98-a-0044 345.215250 350.459875 if you look over there you're not going to you don't see any Arabs driving uh
sw2257B-ms98-a-0045 350.459875 352.735000 racing cars
sw2257B-ms98-a-0046 352.735000 355.497875 they want Mercedes or Cadillacs or Lincolns
sw2257B-ms98-a-0047 355.497875 356.491750 [silence]
sw2257B-ms98-a-0048 356.491750 369.486375 yeah so you know who's who produces those the US produces those and i think after the war no that we're not going to see a bunch of the Arab nations buying Russian equipment because the Russian equipment has gotten blown out of the sky or off the ground
sw2257B-ms98-a-0049 369.486375 371.264875 [silence]
sw2257B-ms98-a-0050 371.264875 377.772625 you know and uh we we pretty much proved our worth in combat as it were and
sw2257B-ms98-a-0051 377.772625 386.441000 where did they get the uh where where does the expertise come for for bringing a whole lot of ground and it d[oesn't]- doesn't come from Russia and it doesn't come from Europe it c[omes]- comes from the United States
sw2257B-ms98-a-0052 386.441000 389.741375 who's going to put out their oil fires the United States
sw2257B-ms98-a-0053 389.741375 399.993000 we have the technology when we have the people and we go do it and i think we're going to i think we're going to be a president in a a presence in the Mideast from now on
sw2257B-ms98-a-0054 399.993000 426.424250 [silence]
sw2257B-ms98-a-0055 426.424250 435.153750 [vocalized-noise] i- i- i agree a hundred percent on that a[fter]- after after all you know i mean everything Bush said Bush put down a deadline if if it wasn't meant to be one he'd attacked
sw2257B-ms98-a-0056 435.153750 442.168000 and that's the way you're supposed to do it instead of doing like Jimmy Carter did you know say w[ell]- you know uh um i'm getting out of the olympics and i'm going to give you back Panama
sw2257B-ms98-a-0057 442.168000 447.247750 you know i mean you either make your stand or you don't if you can't back it up just don't say anything
sw2257B-ms98-a-0058 447.247750 452.269000 and everything Bush said he backed up of course he course he had some real good help
sw2257B-ms98-a-0059 452.269000 453.513250 [silence]
sw2257B-ms98-a-0060 453.513250 461.623375 yeah it's like [vocalized-noise] and like Collin Powell and the rest and uh yeah Dick Cheney those people were real smart they're a lot smarter that any body gives credit for
sw2257B-ms98-a-0061 461.623375 471.734750 [silence]
sw2257B-ms98-a-0062 471.734750 475.488125 Cheney's hard core you don't get to be Secretary of Defense by being a wimp
sw2257B-ms98-a-0063 475.488125 479.497375 [silence]
sw2257B-ms98-a-0064 479.497375 481.998375 but he'd served in the military
sw2257B-ms98-a-0065 481.998375 485.774375 [silence]
sw2257B-ms98-a-0066 485.774375 490.002125 oh yeah the whole i mean the whole thing was done well it was just you know
sw2257B-ms98-a-0067 490.002125 494.697750 it was uh of course he had to fight that to beat microscope anyway
sw2257B-ms98-a-0068 494.697750 498.489875 but i hesitate to call it a war since i mean it was
sw2257B-ms98-a-0069 498.489875 510.476500 i guess it was i'm not used to having them over in six days you know [laughter-really] [laughter-just] kind of gosh we just got started good i guess the Israelis might be over it you know uh you know because_1 they had a seven day war at one time but uh 
sw2257B-ms98-a-0070 510.476500 518.954500 although i- i wish instead of turning south you know an[d]- taking a right turn and going down Kuwait City i wished we'd just turned left and gone toward Baghdad
sw2257B-ms98-a-0071 518.954500 526.492625 [silence]
sw2257B-ms98-a-0072 526.492625 531.199250 i think we should have because_1 because_1 we're go[ing]- if we don't do it now we're going to have to do it shortly
sw2257B-ms98-a-0073 531.199250 543.210625 [silence]
sw2257B-ms98-a-0074 543.210625 554.771875 but the only thing that'll save that is we won't get the credit for or the blame for the massacre an[d]- and then if we do have to to go back in it will be because_1 you know someone asked us to
sw2257B-ms98-a-0075 554.771875 562.990875 and of course now's the time to do it because_1 since we have the army over there i'd sure hate to you know spend eight months pulling them_1 out and then turn right around send them back over again
sw2257B-ms98-a-0076 562.990875 573.694000 [silence]
sw2257B-ms98-a-0077 573.694000 578.519500 oh yeah they shouldn't leave anything in Bagdad taller than three feet
sw2257B-ms98-a-0078 578.519500 589.490250 they jus[t]- you know jus[t]- just level the whole place and let it go but we're going to have to be over there and we're and our presence is going to have to be felt and they've got to be strong presidents or presence uh if we don't then i think that we're going to be back there [noise]
sw2257B-ms98-a-0079 589.490250 594.999000 you know in the Jimmy Car[ter]- uh Carter era you know wringing your hands and going trust me trust me
