sw2257A-ms98-a-0006 11.977375 23.176125 the uh th[e]- the biggest difference i got to agree was the idea that we were allowed to go and get it done rather than than set up a a line and say we're not going to let you cross this this point anymore and
sw2257A-ms98-a-0007 23.176125 28.996750 that really hurt the uh the peop[le]- uh the Vietnam experience uh i got to admit that one

sw2257A-ms98-a-0019 67.958875 82.262750 but is i mean is that any different than uh the way it is in even our country i mean uh back in the fifties and forties the blacks didn't like the whites the whites didn't like the blacks but we're getting to the point where we get along pretty good i mean
sw2257A-ms98-a-0020 82.262750 87.954500 isn't it logical that just any of th[e]- that you can solve differences like that
