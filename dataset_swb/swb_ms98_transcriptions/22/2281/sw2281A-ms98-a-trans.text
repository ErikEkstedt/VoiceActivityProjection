sw2281A-ms98-a-0058 259.055375 269.629000 that's too bad that's not the topic i [laughter-know] self-improvement i think is the only one i got something like that when i got i'd been out of school for quite a while i think um back when it was again real topical um
sw2281A-ms98-a-0059 269.629000 277.557625 uh women my age about then were maybe having trouble with parents or mothers and a friend of mine bought me something called My Mother and Myself and i tried to read it and i went

sw2281A-ms98-a-0078 337.899875 341.523625 that's what i- i was impressed with how much documenting he does
sw2281A-ms98-a-0079 341.523625 349.720500 how much how much um he's so much like Michener he's not as bad in terms of going into so much depth but he he's i like the way he writes
sw2281A-ms98-a-0080 349.720500 355.647500 and if it's not something that moves with me in the first two or three chapters something like that i just won't keep it you know

sw2281A-ms98-a-0084 370.122375 377.620250 and his action anecdotes weren't very good at all he he had he jumps around he in that particular book i don't know how his other ones are but in that one he jumped around a little bit
sw2281A-ms98-a-0085 377.620250 386.819625 in terms of subways and just [vocalized-noise] just the general transition i mean it i didn't you know i really [vocalized-noise] you have to be interested in the subject too i think that was part of my problem
sw2281A-ms98-a-0086 386.819625 389.305500 [silence]
sw2281A-ms98-a-0087 389.305500 401.987250 anything to be real interesting yeah well it's good to talk to somebody i don't read as much as i used to um my husband's a TIer and i'm in journalism so i do a lot of writing um during the normal course of my job and it's kind of um
sw2281A-ms98-a-0088 401.987250 406.649625 sad when you find out the you know i thought i would get more toward reading and i'm getting less
