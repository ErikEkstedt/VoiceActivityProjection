sw2277B-ms98-a-0002 1.788750 5.812500 no but my husband's mother was in a nursing home
sw2277B-ms98-a-0003 5.812500 8.936500 and she was in there she got sick
sw2277B-ms98-a-0004 8.936500 13.569125 and they put her in a nursing home because_1 you couldn't we couldn't afford a nurse
sw2277B-ms98-a-0005 13.569125 16.462375 t[o]- you know a[ll]- all day nurse
sw2277B-ms98-a-0006 16.462375 21.733500 yeah well at least as they told us uh two shifts
sw2277B-ms98-a-0007 21.733500 31.940250 you know that's sixteen hours because_1 one would come in the morning and one would be at night i mean in the afternoon and then that night it wouldn't need one
sw2277B-ms98-a-0008 31.940250 35.510375 you know because_1 she would be sleeping so i would be here then
sw2277B-ms98-a-0009 35.510375 39.693000 [silence]
sw2277B-ms98-a-0010 39.693000 44.096500 well the nursing home is covered by uh social security see
sw2277B-ms98-a-0011 44.096500 46.855000 and the nurses aren't no
sw2277B-ms98-a-0012 46.855000 48.966500 see you have to pay that
sw2277B-ms98-a-0013 48.966500 53.567000 and oh yeah if you put nursing home and that's another thing i
sw2277B-ms98-a-0014 53.567000 61.462375 you know you got to find a good nursing home is very hard to find because the people don't care most of them_1 don't care some of them_1 do care
sw2277B-ms98-a-0015 61.462375 69.495125 the work that you know the the nurse aide that what the problem is i think it's the nurses' aide they don't pay them enough to keep them_1 there
sw2277B-ms98-a-0016 69.495125 71.973875 and to do the things that they need to do
sw2277B-ms98-a-0017 71.973875 78.976500 [silence]
sw2277B-ms98-a-0018 78.976500 80.343125 uh-huh
sw2277B-ms98-a-0019 80.343125 87.533250 [silence]
sw2277B-ms98-a-0020 87.533250 94.054875 oh yeah it's gets bad some of them_1 and then it depends on the nursing home and how bad it is
sw2277B-ms98-a-0021 94.054875 98.129875 you know because_1 they have some nursing home that don't have anybody that's not
sw2277B-ms98-a-0022 98.129875 100.222875 walking you know
sw2277B-ms98-a-0023 100.222875 103.270125 and it just depends on how bad that person is
sw2277B-ms98-a-0024 103.270125 113.339875 [silence]
sw2277B-ms98-a-0025 113.339875 114.650250 yeah
sw2277B-ms98-a-0026 114.650250 116.674875 you ought to do your job
sw2277B-ms98-a-0027 116.674875 121.929875 and if you can't if you can't i think they should get out of it instead of mistreating the people
sw2277B-ms98-a-0028 121.929875 125.700625 [silence]
sw2277B-ms98-a-0029 125.700625 126.973750 well
sw2277B-ms98-a-0030 126.973750 129.957750 [silence]
sw2277B-ms98-a-0031 129.957750 132.845500 they st[eal]- yeah that and they steal
sw2277B-ms98-a-0032 132.845500 144.463500 uh oh yeah i used to take uh every week you know i have to threaten it which it doesn't make sense for me to have to sit there and threaten uh people um that work there
sw2277B-ms98-a-0033 144.463500 155.143250 you know like i bring her i bought her a blanket and i had this girl hand crocheted her a lap blanket you know because_1 she sits in a wheel chair but she can walk they just sit them_1 in wheel chairs
sw2277B-ms98-a-0034 155.143250 164.599625 and i told her uh i came up there the following week and it was gone i said where is it she said in the washer i said i tell you what when i come back it better be here
sw2277B-ms98-a-0035 164.599625 168.853375 because they went to the washer we didn't find it i said you all better find it
sw2277B-ms98-a-0036 168.853375 175.659625 and you know bed[spread]- her bedspread sh[e]- i took her a bedspread because sh[e]- a comforter because she was always cold
sw2277B-ms98-a-0037 175.659625 182.819500 and so uh you know then [laughter] i had to put write the name on the whole bedspread i'm talking like it's 
sw2277B-ms98-a-0038 182.819500 190.473875 it almost [laughter] you know on both sides so that they can't turn it over and put it on somebody else's bed
sw2277B-ms98-a-0039 190.473875 191.645750 [silence]
sw2277B-ms98-a-0040 191.645750 192.958000 huh-uh
sw2277B-ms98-a-0041 192.958000 202.001750 [silence]
sw2277B-ms98-a-0042 202.001750 208.839500 yeah well see th[is]- this one i- i is more or less first hand you know she just died um
sw2277B-ms98-a-0043 208.839500 213.800750 we buried her February but she had been in there at least i know f[or]-
sw2277B-ms98-a-0044 213.800750 216.099750 seven years eight years
sw2277B-ms98-a-0045 216.099750 219.259750 and he didn't want to put her in there but he can't afford it
sw2277B-ms98-a-0046 219.259750 221.532500 and that's another thing you know
sw2277B-ms98-a-0047 221.532500 225.774125 [silence]
sw2277B-ms98-a-0048 225.774125 234.228000 but you don't ha[ve]- it depends on when didn't you you have a choice the only thing i can say is you have a choice of where they go sometimes
sw2277B-ms98-a-0049 234.228000 236.531750 sometimes you don't
sw2277B-ms98-a-0050 236.531750 247.231250 and then you have to check out the nursing home and the only way you're going to check out a nursing home is to actually put them in there and check on them_1 every time but don't tell the people
sw2277B-ms98-a-0051 247.231250 248.922375 yeah
sw2277B-ms98-a-0052 248.922375 258.573000 you have to do one of them_1 you know spontaneous things like maybe three o'clock in the afternoon or one o'clock in the afternoon and stuff like that because_1 they're not expecting you
sw2277B-ms98-a-0053 258.573000 265.754875 you know they expect you Sa[turday]- like on Saturdays Friday you know Saturdays and Sundays and Friday and stuff but not during the week
sw2277B-ms98-a-0054 265.754875 267.323250 hum-um
sw2277B-ms98-a-0055 267.323250 276.529750 it gets bad it is nursing home i think is sometimes i think some people put them in there and then they just die that's about what it's for
sw2277B-ms98-a-0056 276.529750 279.970250 and it's really not some people don't need to be in there
sw2277B-ms98-a-0057 279.970250 284.769500 [silence]
sw2277B-ms98-a-0058 284.769500 295.448875 that's right and i don't think that's right i think they should have a place to some of the people that don't need to be in the nursing home with nurses they need to have a place for them_1 like a retirement home
sw2277B-ms98-a-0059 295.448875 304.832875 [silence]
sw2277B-ms98-a-0060 304.832875 306.049500 yeah
sw2277B-ms98-a-0061 306.049500 307.101500 [silence]
sw2277B-ms98-a-0062 307.101500 308.397250 don't
sw2277B-ms98-a-0063 308.397250 310.281625 [silence]
sw2277B-ms98-a-0064 310.281625 311.660875 yeah
sw2277B-ms98-a-0065 311.660875 318.975000 and see that would be okay you could have somebody check on each one of them_1 every day you know go by and see what they need
sw2277B-ms98-a-0066 318.975000 322.197125 [silence]
sw2277B-ms98-a-0067 322.197125 325.957250 little place to live you know even just a little room
sw2277B-ms98-a-0068 325.957250 327.321500 or whatever
sw2277B-ms98-a-0069 327.321500 329.677625 [silence]
sw2277B-ms98-a-0070 329.677625 332.661250 sometimes yeah it depends on the patient
sw2277B-ms98-a-0071 332.661250 339.186000 and and i guess sometimes the availability of that of the room and how they done built the hospitals
sw2277B-ms98-a-0072 339.186000 344.999500 because i know one lady like she had a roommate but the woman across the hall didn't have one
sw2277B-ms98-a-0073 344.999500 346.719875 [silence]
sw2277B-ms98-a-0074 346.719875 349.179250 <b_aside> get my purse uh <e_aside>
sw2277B-ms98-a-0075 349.179250 353.705500 but it it it you know it just to me nursing homes are um
sw2277B-ms98-a-0076 353.705500 357.129500 bad news unless you can find a really good one
sw2277B-ms98-a-0077 357.129500 362.002125 and those are rare but there are some good ones and there are some bad ones
sw2277B-ms98-a-0078 362.002125 364.551875 i mean [laughter]
sw2277B-ms98-a-0079 364.551875 371.630750 [silence]
sw2277B-ms98-a-0080 371.630750 380.204500 i told my husband well is this weird because see what people don't understand is even the people that work in the nursing home they will get old one day
sw2277B-ms98-a-0081 380.204500 385.805625 and everything that they do to somebody will come back to them_1 that's the way i feel yeah
sw2277B-ms98-a-0082 385.805625 386.930500 [silence]
sw2277B-ms98-a-0083 386.930500 389.758750 or maybe that won't not make it that far in life
sw2277B-ms98-a-0084 389.758750 392.022750 for what they did to somebody but
sw2277B-ms98-a-0085 392.022750 396.730250 [silence]
sw2277B-ms98-a-0086 396.730250 402.743000 that's the whole that's what i think i think God will definitely get uh you know uh
sw2277B-ms98-a-0087 402.743000 415.146125 there's two people that i know you should not mess uh abuse and that's a child and a so[meone]- person that's elderly you shouldn't abuse anybody but but down right
sw2277B-ms98-a-0088 415.146125 420.350500 them people them two people are the most helpless people you see what i'm saying
sw2277B-ms98-a-0089 420.350500 426.622375 you know they can't really defend themselves like somebody gro[wn]- uh say my age you know you know yeah 
sw2277B-ms98-a-0090 426.622375 429.443875 because i can tell somebody to go leave me alone
sw2277B-ms98-a-0091 429.443875 431.341500 but they so old
sw2277B-ms98-a-0092 431.341500 432.560625 yeah
sw2277B-ms98-a-0093 432.560625 437.431500 you can force their hand more or less but see somebody that old they don't know
sw2277B-ms98-a-0094 437.431500 442.416375 and then what they what are they going to do and if they tell anybody people always say oh they're just senile
sw2277B-ms98-a-0095 442.416375 446.973750 you know huh-uh [laughter] and that ain't right neither
sw2277B-ms98-a-0096 446.973750 448.046375 [silence]
sw2277B-ms98-a-0097 448.046375 449.119250 so
sw2277B-ms98-a-0098 449.119250 457.536500 it it it it gets bad you know it just depends on like i said the nursing home now my grandmother was in a nursing home in California 
sw2277B-ms98-a-0099 457.536500 463.529625 before she died but it was a nice nursing home for you know it was one of the nice ones
sw2277B-ms98-a-0100 463.529625 466.461125 but now my mom and them had to pay for that too
sw2277B-ms98-a-0101 466.461125 468.909000 [silence]
sw2277B-ms98-a-0102 468.909000 477.100625 you have to pay more you know social security covers so much and then um you have to pay some more and she chose to pay some more
sw2277B-ms98-a-0103 477.100625 480.632625 if she you know since it was like my my grandmother had
sw2277B-ms98-a-0104 480.632625 484.598750 thirteen kids so they all you know paid their month
sw2277B-ms98-a-0105 484.598750 488.273875 which was better [vocalized-noise] but see my husband's a only child
sw2277B-ms98-a-0106 488.273875 490.907000 [laughter]
sw2277B-ms98-a-0107 490.907000 492.606750 yeah
sw2277B-ms98-a-0108 492.606750 497.627625 [silence]
sw2277B-ms98-a-0109 497.627625 508.916500 if yeah see and then there's another thing she told me is you have to make sure everybody cooperates because like by her her being there if someone if if one of her brothers didn't send in their check 
sw2277B-ms98-a-0110 508.916500 510.639500 she would have to pay it
sw2277B-ms98-a-0111 510.639500 517.091125 you know and wait for him to whenever he decide to pay it [laughter] you know
sw2277B-ms98-a-0112 517.091125 521.701875 [silence]
sw2277B-ms98-a-0113 521.701875 522.812625 um-hum
sw2277B-ms98-a-0114 522.812625 526.557875 [silence]
sw2277B-ms98-a-0115 526.557875 527.930875 um-hum
sw2277B-ms98-a-0116 527.930875 532.729875 [silence]
sw2277B-ms98-a-0117 532.729875 533.956875 yeah
sw2277B-ms98-a-0118 533.956875 539.895500 [silence]
sw2277B-ms98-a-0119 539.895500 541.213000 yeah
sw2277B-ms98-a-0120 541.213000 543.175875 [silence]
sw2277B-ms98-a-0121 543.175875 544.786875 just pretty
sw2277B-ms98-a-0122 544.786875 552.118750 oh yeah see that's what that's what gets me like well just like my brother he has got his five bedroom house
sw2277B-ms98-a-0123 552.118750 557.183375 in California with the swimming pool and here i am renting a house barely making it
sw2277B-ms98-a-0124 557.183375 567.923250 [silence]
sw2277B-ms98-a-0125 567.923250 568.974125 um-hum
sw2277B-ms98-a-0126 568.974125 570.733875 [silence]
sw2277B-ms98-a-0127 570.733875 572.055125 yeah
sw2277B-ms98-a-0128 572.055125 582.830000 and then you know it's like i tell him you make more money than i do than i could ever really think about if i made as much money as my brother i would be just like set for life [laughter]
sw2277B-ms98-a-0129 582.830000 591.810500 you [laughter-know] but not him he's never happy and i think that's that's why he makes as much as he do is because he keeps thriving for more
sw2277B-ms98-a-0130 591.810500 595.055375 which i probably if i got what i wanted i'd be okay
sw2277B-ms98-a-0131 595.055375 596.398750 you know
sw2277B-ms98-a-0132 596.398750 598.758000 [silence]
