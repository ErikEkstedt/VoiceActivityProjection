sw2259B-ms98-a-0002 5.893250 17.697000 at currently i think they are a little restrictive uh particularly for uh certain ethnic groups or from certain countries um
sw2259B-ms98-a-0003 17.697000 26.421500 i think we should permit uh more immigration from eastern Europe for example
sw2259B-ms98-a-0004 26.421500 41.168750 uh particularly the uh the Jewish uh uh people from Russia i think we could permit more of them in than we have uh permitted in the last uh several years
sw2259B-ms98-a-0005 41.168750 45.621125 and i think we have uh uh
sw2259B-ms98-a-0006 45.621125 50.014375 too much restriction on the uh on the Orientals also
sw2259B-ms98-a-0007 50.014375 53.351500 but of course that's just my opinion [laughter]
sw2259B-ms98-a-0008 53.351500 57.827250 [silence]
sw2259B-ms98-a-0009 57.827250 59.084625 um-hum
sw2259B-ms98-a-0010 59.084625 60.873875 [silence]
sw2259B-ms98-a-0011 60.873875 62.440875 um-hum
sw2259B-ms98-a-0012 62.440875 71.156125 well we seem to uh to favor certain uh uh countries particularly South American countries and uh
sw2259B-ms98-a-0013 71.156125 79.563750 there is no uh uh i have nothing of course against uh the uh the South Americans or uh
sw2259B-ms98-a-0014 79.563750 90.365625 or Hispanics in that sense but i think we uh are more restrictive of the um so called eastern uh European countries than we uh
sw2259B-ms98-a-0015 90.365625 96.729750 uh we should be of course that's from my own bias since my ancestors from [laughter-Eastern] [laughter-Europe] [laughter-so] 
sw2259B-ms98-a-0016 96.729750 99.830250 and uh
sw2259B-ms98-a-0017 99.830250 109.768000 so i think uh you know the [noise] um embargo we placed on the uh on the Russian Jews although we s[pent]- of uh
sw2259B-ms98-a-0018 109.768000 111.152250 [silence]
sw2259B-ms98-a-0019 111.152250 121.434250 spent years and years uh lobbying for their release and their ability to um immigrate from Russia as soon as that occurred we
sw2259B-ms98-a-0020 121.434250 133.281875 simply said that uh instead of the uh hundred and fifty thousand or so who wanted to immigrate to this country we cut that by uh two thirds so
sw2259B-ms98-a-0021 133.281875 136.618625 i do not quite go along with that but [laughter]
sw2259B-ms98-a-0022 136.618625 137.657375 [silence]
sw2259B-ms98-a-0023 137.657375 139.028500 no
sw2259B-ms98-a-0024 139.028500 145.937875 and i still think you know again kind of having uh uh within this century come from a uh
sw2259B-ms98-a-0025 145.937875 146.964625 [silence]
sw2259B-ms98-a-0026 146.964625 155.045375 uh an immigrant family or immigrant families on both sides both my mother's parents and my father's parents were immigrants so
sw2259B-ms98-a-0027 155.045375 159.996375 i'm a little touchy [noise] every now and then about that [laughter]
sw2259B-ms98-a-0028 159.996375 171.475250 [silence]
sw2259B-ms98-a-0029 171.475250 172.734250 um-hum
sw2259B-ms98-a-0030 172.734250 177.624875 [silence]
sw2259B-ms98-a-0031 177.624875 179.063250 oh my [laughter]
sw2259B-ms98-a-0032 179.063250 197.743875 [silence]
sw2259B-ms98-a-0033 197.743875 199.104000 uh-huh
sw2259B-ms98-a-0034 199.104000 211.416000 [silence]
sw2259B-ms98-a-0035 211.416000 220.813250 well i think in a way though uh uh i also have uh an opposite [laughter-point] [laughter-of] [laughter-view] which is uh
sw2259B-ms98-a-0036 220.813250 230.738500 although i believe we should uh permit uh you know constant immigration into this country um
sw2259B-ms98-a-0037 230.738500 237.713500 i think we should uh primarily for economic reasons i think we should have um
sw2259B-ms98-a-0038 237.713500 250.647875 some quotas of course my family and i again again that was you know my uh grandparents came over during the time when uh there were quotas so they had to wait uh
sw2259B-ms98-a-0039 250.647875 256.404375 you know in uh certain parts of Europe for years before they were permitted to come over
sw2259B-ms98-a-0040 256.404375 258.548250 so you know [laughter] but uh
sw2259B-ms98-a-0041 258.548250 262.476375 i think unrestricted immigration i think is not uh
sw2259B-ms98-a-0042 262.476375 263.643000 [silence]
sw2259B-ms98-a-0043 263.643000 265.929000 is not best uh
sw2259B-ms98-a-0044 265.929000 292.060875 [silence]
sw2259B-ms98-a-0045 292.060875 297.438125 um-hum well you know there's another aspect of this too they're also uh
sw2259B-ms98-a-0046 297.438125 298.568125 [silence]
sw2259B-ms98-a-0047 298.568125 305.325250 uh diminishing the uh health restrictions which
sw2259B-ms98-a-0048 305.325250 306.753750 [silence]
sw2259B-ms98-a-0049 306.753750 309.283875 well yes there are were some uh
sw2259B-ms98-a-0050 309.283875 310.343000 [silence]
sw2259B-ms98-a-0051 310.343000 316.427250 regulations over i don't know whether they're laws passed or or whatever they're called uh just recently where
sw2259B-ms98-a-0052 316.427250 318.380250 uh
sw2259B-ms98-a-0053 318.380250 330.808125 people with certain diseases cannot be excluded uh from immigration AIDS is one for example and uh recently uh
sw2259B-ms98-a-0054 330.808125 338.416000 tuberculosis which at one time if you had tuberculosis you could not get into this country uh they dropped that also
sw2259B-ms98-a-0055 338.416000 346.766875 so i think in in s[ome]- some as[pect]- some ways we are uh becoming a little too egalitarian in that in that sense but uh
sw2259B-ms98-a-0056 346.766875 347.833375 [silence]
sw2259B-ms98-a-0057 347.833375 350.636750 i think we should be a little more circumspect about it
sw2259B-ms98-a-0058 350.636750 352.643375 again my opinion [laughter]
sw2259B-ms98-a-0059 352.643375 354.424375 [silence]
sw2259B-ms98-a-0060 354.424375 356.174250 think we've talked long enough
sw2259B-ms98-a-0061 356.174250 358.351500 [laughter] all right
sw2259B-ms98-a-0062 358.351500 360.937250 or i- i- i have talked long enough
sw2259B-ms98-a-0063 360.937250 361.679375 [laughter]
sw2259B-ms98-a-0064 361.679375 362.712000 [laughter]
