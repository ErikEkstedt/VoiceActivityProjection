sw2288A-ms98-a-0096 582.420875 585.426250 and all their money has to go in their savings account
sw2288A-ms98-a-0097 585.426250 590.860625 you know which maybe i'm being a little bit too harsh [laughter-but] but if they need something i buy it for them_1
sw2288A-ms98-a-0098 590.860625 592.913250 you know i mean if it's an absolute need
sw2288A-ms98-a-0099 592.913250 599.009375 you know if i mean if they want something occasionally but most of the time if it's a need i just get it
