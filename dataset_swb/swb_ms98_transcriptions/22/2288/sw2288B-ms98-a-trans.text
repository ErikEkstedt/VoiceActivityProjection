sw2288B-ms98-a-0002 1.976000 7.070750 well budgeting is a sore subject in this [laughter-family]
sw2288B-ms98-a-0003 7.070750 20.592125 [laughter] we've actually uh uh tried uh budgeting is very important to us we we try it every month and um [vocalized-noise] i think it's good i mean it it gives us a sense of uh
sw2288B-ms98-a-0004 20.592125 31.979625 uh of of staying in some semblance of control but uh we we do have uh we we never seem to be able to stick with it

sw2288B-ms98-a-0012 68.936625 70.934000 oh okay oh i see
sw2288B-ms98-a-0013 70.934000 72.050125 oh sure
sw2288B-ms98-a-0014 72.050125 72.930000 [silence]
sw2288B-ms98-a-0015 72.930000 75.122250 yeah okay yeah yeah that makes perfect sense [laughter]
sw2288B-ms98-a-0016 75.122250 76.172000 [laughter]
sw2288B-ms98-a-0017 76.172000 80.726125 yeah well yeah uh we ours is actually very detailed um
sw2288B-ms98-a-0018 80.726125 89.855625 we we've got categories for everything and uh we we figure out how much income the both of us are going to have in a month
sw2288B-ms98-a-0019 89.855625 97.962000 and we take every penny of that and we allocate it under all these different categories unfortunately there's a big category called miscellaneous
sw2288B-ms98-a-0020 97.962000 100.265125 and uh misc[ellaneous]-
sw2288B-ms98-a-0021 100.265125 104.872000 that's the one that kills us every time miscellaneous is never what we
sw2288B-ms98-a-0022 104.872000 112.709500 figure it's going to be it's never what it was last month and uh and uh you know it's it's the one that's always the killer
sw2288B-ms98-a-0023 112.709500 121.125750 um but i uh you know it's uh in fact when uh we pay our check when we when we
sw2288B-ms98-a-0024 121.125750 129.632500 you know write our checks we even categorize our payments and i mean we even get into that kind of detail um s[o]- s[o]-
sw2288B-ms98-a-0025 129.632500 135.963375 so we i mean we do uh when you know whenever we
sw2288B-ms98-a-0026 135.963375 146.109875 go through the process of paying the bills we know exactly what category we're paying it for and uh we have a pretty good sense of where our money's going we don't have any control over it
sw2288B-ms98-a-0027 146.109875 149.595125 but we have a real good sense of where it's going [laughter]
sw2288B-ms98-a-0028 149.595125 155.433875 [silence]
sw2288B-ms98-a-0029 155.433875 156.304625 yeah

sw2288B-ms98-a-0031 159.588125 160.590375 yeah
sw2288B-ms98-a-0032 160.590375 161.373000 well
sw2288B-ms98-a-0033 161.373000 165.790250 we're we're at a point where we're trying to accomplish a lot of things right now and uh like
sw2288B-ms98-a-0034 165.790250 169.410750 my wife's going back to school and i'm going to school
sw2288B-ms98-a-0035 169.410750 179.396375 and we're our kid we've got the kids who are at the stage where they need to take piano lessons and and uh you know play baseball and and do all those fun things
sw2288B-ms98-a-0036 179.396375 185.848250 and uh i think i think we'd be totally bankrupt if we didn't do something um
sw2288B-ms98-a-0037 185.848250 190.415875 and and what we've proven to ourselves what we prove to ourselves every month
sw2288B-ms98-a-0038 190.415875 198.964500 is that we're spending more than than we make [laughter] so it's it's kind of depressing to see it in black and white but uh yeah
sw2288B-ms98-a-0039 198.964500 210.443000 [silence]
sw2288B-ms98-a-0040 210.443000 211.921625 right

sw2288B-ms98-a-0043 216.983625 226.442000 well no i- i- i think um i- i- i don't think we're saving anything i- i think what we're doing is we're we're we're making it possible to
sw2288B-ms98-a-0044 226.442000 233.335125 to well and the fact what it is is it's making it possible to live beyond our means um [vocalized-noise] because
sw2288B-ms98-a-0045 233.335125 241.539875 you know wh[at]- if we didn't track it we'd we'd totally blow it i think is what it would end up um um
sw2288B-ms98-a-0046 241.539875 247.861375 so you know we we do know that we can tell when we're getting to the point where we've just got to
sw2288B-ms98-a-0047 247.861375 254.701000 uh hold back on something uh we can we can see a cash flow that says
sw2288B-ms98-a-0048 254.701000 267.080875 this you know we can't do this right now because the money's just not there we we we're going to have to put it off for a week or a month or whatever the case so so yeah it [vocalized-noise] you know it's um
sw2288B-ms98-a-0049 267.080875 275.390125 we uh you know we're not going to get this budget isn't going to make us rich but it is going to prevent us from going into poverty uh but
sw2288B-ms98-a-0050 275.390125 279.853125 yeah uh-huh but we look at it sort of as an investment in the future too
sw2288B-ms98-a-0051 279.853125 285.152625 you know i'm going back to school my wife's going back to school too our lifestyle right now
sw2288B-ms98-a-0052 285.152625 296.379125 is meant to position ourselves so finan[cial]- uh the these financial problems won't be problems uh in the future and uh so
sw2288B-ms98-a-0053 296.379125 306.458750 we've that's that's the we're look we look it as as yeah we're living like this now but it's a short term investment for for a better lifestyle later on

sw2288B-ms98-a-0060 317.167750 320.633125 we're going we're going through the exact same thing
sw2288B-ms98-a-0061 320.633125 321.987625 yeah

sw2288B-ms98-a-0068 335.443125 339.106375 i- i don't know that we'd ever be able to get to that point but uh
sw2288B-ms98-a-0069 339.106375 340.535000 um
sw2288B-ms98-a-0070 340.535000 343.497375 but it's something to work for [laughter]

sw2288B-ms98-a-0072 346.545125 347.999125 yeah yeah

sw2288B-ms98-a-0074 351.199750 352.237125 sure
sw2288B-ms98-a-0075 352.237125 354.907750 that's i think we're in probably in the same position
sw2288B-ms98-a-0076 354.907750 361.022500 [silence]
sw2288B-ms98-a-0077 361.022500 362.059625 yeah

sw2288B-ms98-a-0080 364.407375 370.637625 yeah um and and and it also makes it possible
sw2288B-ms98-a-0081 370.637625 374.483500 you i think before we did any kind of budgeting
sw2288B-ms98-a-0082 374.483500 380.010500 w[e]- we we were in we were in a constant state of saying we can't afford anything
sw2288B-ms98-a-0083 380.010500 384.958875 you know we can't do anything we can't afford anything and now
sw2288B-ms98-a-0084 384.958875 388.883375 we can at least say well we can fit this in
sw2288B-ms98-a-0085 388.883375 399.580125 it's it doesn't really work very well but we can fit this expense in and so by being a little organized we can we can allow ourselves some things that we couldn't before
sw2288B-ms98-a-0086 399.580125 400.974750 [silence]
sw2288B-ms98-a-0087 400.974750 402.015250 yeah

sw2288B-ms98-a-0091 413.739000 416.956250 that's right that's right [laughter] it it it
sw2288B-ms98-a-0092 416.956250 418.998625 [silence]
sw2288B-ms98-a-0093 418.998625 421.637250 yeah i we i think that uh
sw2288B-ms98-a-0094 421.637250 428.071375 part of the uh the reason we we we got so almost fanatical about budgeting is that
sw2288B-ms98-a-0095 428.071375 431.566250 that there were those years where we lived that way
sw2288B-ms98-a-0096 431.566250 433.142000 and we're still paying for it
sw2288B-ms98-a-0097 433.142000 437.006375 [laughter-you] [laughter-know] and so the only way to get out
sw2288B-ms98-a-0098 437.006375 440.645000 from under that is to is to do some kind of budgeting
sw2288B-ms98-a-0099 440.645000 441.864250 um
sw2288B-ms98-a-0100 441.864250 444.426875 yeah you don't want to
sw2288B-ms98-a-0101 444.426875 447.167500 especially when it comes time and the kids are grown up
sw2288B-ms98-a-0102 447.167500 455.678250 and they're they want to do things like go to college uh you don't want to say well we're still paying for the mistake we made twenty years ago you know and

sw2288B-ms98-a-0112 485.479250 489.731625 um you know you just can't count on them being totally brilliant
sw2288B-ms98-a-0113 489.731625 499.483250 though though they are but you can't count on them being totally brilliant uh so that they can get scholarships and and things like that um it's you know
sw2288B-ms98-a-0114 499.483250 502.352875 it doesn't always work that way [laughter]
sw2288B-ms98-a-0115 502.352875 503.438125 right
sw2288B-ms98-a-0116 503.438125 510.033625 right or at least loans [laughter] that they pay off [laughter]

sw2288B-ms98-a-0127 535.449250 540.227750 i'm i'm also hoping that this budget process will rub off on them
sw2288B-ms98-a-0128 540.227750 543.940625 because uh when i grew up i had no
sw2288B-ms98-a-0129 543.940625 551.599625 no involvement in finances whatsoever you know and so when i became an adult and i was responsible for
sw2288B-ms98-a-0130 551.599625 562.120875 for the money i had no skills and no background and no tools and and uh so we had to learn it the hard way and and um
sw2288B-ms98-a-0131 562.120875 570.596250 so we we're trying to get the kids involved with that that you know when they get an allowance uh part of that's supposed to go to savings for instance
sw2288B-ms98-a-0132 570.596250 576.132000 and uh um yeah and they understand our eh the pro[cess]- our process [vocalized-noise]
