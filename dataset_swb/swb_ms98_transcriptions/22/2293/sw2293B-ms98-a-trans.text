sw2293B-ms98-a-0003 2.534250 6.488125 well um discussing air pollution today i guess
sw2293B-ms98-a-0004 6.488125 8.000000 um
sw2293B-ms98-a-0005 8.000000 11.804625 uh well [laughter] give me your first impressions

sw2293B-ms98-a-0010 20.761625 28.392000 [silence]
sw2293B-ms98-a-0011 28.392000 34.160000 uh puts a whole yeah gets a whole new picture to what [laughter] real air pollution can be
sw2293B-ms98-a-0012 34.160000 40.442125 but uh that stuff going on over there wha[t]- what uh what part of Pennsylvania are you in
sw2293B-ms98-a-0013 40.442125 41.754375 [silence]
sw2293B-ms98-a-0014 41.754375 43.550375 o[kay]- okay
sw2293B-ms98-a-0015 43.550375 56.488625 okay so it's i[t's]- it's amazing too you know y[ou]- with that with the oil wells burning over there that's that's the exact same stuff that's coming out of cars every day just in uh just in a little different grade i guess
sw2293B-ms98-a-0016 56.488625 59.349000 but uh in Dallas we've got
sw2293B-ms98-a-0017 59.349000 61.325250 we've just uh
sw2293B-ms98-a-0018 61.325250 73.721000 brought in a whole new set of uh requirements on inspections and things like that for cars because uh people just don't use mass transit and stuff in Dallas everybody loves their car and
sw2293B-ms98-a-0019 73.721000 83.780875 you see an awful lot of uh one person vehicles on the road on during rush hours that seems to be our biggest problem down here um
sw2293B-ms98-a-0020 83.780875 85.878125 you know there's uh
sw2293B-ms98-a-0021 85.878125 98.369750 there's a lot of industry around but uh it's not it's any pollution that industry's dumping around here is not going into the air it's typically water [laughter] type situation
sw2293B-ms98-a-0022 98.369750 110.738625 [silence]
sw2293B-ms98-a-0023 110.738625 112.231875 um-hum
sw2293B-ms98-a-0024 112.231875 113.526750 [silence]
sw2293B-ms98-a-0025 113.526750 121.292625 yeah it's it's yeah like like two hours of output or something like that yeah that's true that's true
sw2293B-ms98-a-0026 121.292625 130.560500 yeah i uh i grew up in South Dakota so i was never [laughter] i was never exposed to anything of of the of the sort um
sw2293B-ms98-a-0027 130.560500 142.970500 there were always the EPA people and what not were always telling us that uh farm chemicals and what not were destroying our water system and all that but we just we just never saw the results uh
sw2293B-ms98-a-0028 142.970500 149.670500 there was there was dust in the air during uh planting seasons and what not but uh that that was all we ever saw and then
sw2293B-ms98-a-0029 149.670500 160.354625 five years ago i i moved to Dallas and i suddenly start to understand what uh burning eyes uh and all that stuff is about that i'd always heard about
sw2293B-ms98-a-0030 160.354625 162.209625 it uh
sw2293B-ms98-a-0031 162.209625 166.013750 it's it gets it's real depressing um
sw2293B-ms98-a-0032 166.013750 176.994875 in the morning sometime uh just y[ou]- you can tell if it's a good day or a bad day by uh how far out from downtown uh y[ou]- you can be on the road and still not see it
sw2293B-ms98-a-0033 176.994875 178.340000 [laughter-and] uh
sw2293B-ms98-a-0034 178.340000 184.012750 you know i mean it's not uh i don't think Dallas is considered uh a a real bad 
sw2293B-ms98-a-0035 184.012750 197.254500 place for for air pollution but you you can tell you can tell the differences in the days when it's when the haze is kind of yellowish gray instead of just being a a foggy misty color
sw2293B-ms98-a-0036 197.254500 204.023625 and uh it it's a little it's a little disappointing sometimes that you start to realize what you're breathing
sw2293B-ms98-a-0037 204.023625 220.025375 [silence]
sw2293B-ms98-a-0038 220.025375 221.739625 right
sw2293B-ms98-a-0039 221.739625 224.598625 right i[t's]- it's
sw2293B-ms98-a-0040 224.598625 228.342125 that there really isn't a whole lot i[t's]- it's one of those uh
sw2293B-ms98-a-0041 228.342125 236.996750 [noise] it's one of those things that if they do a little bit and uh and e[very]- you know e[very]- every little bit does help i i do believe that
sw2293B-ms98-a-0042 236.996750 247.170250 um but i also believe that uh the earth is is a kind of a self-regulating system and uh it will clean itself up eventually
sw2293B-ms98-a-0043 247.170250 259.345250 it the whole idea is not to not to push the limit too hard i guess l[et]- let the you know let the natural natural systems take care of the problem as much as possible
sw2293B-ms98-a-0044 259.345250 266.321000 [silence]
sw2293B-ms98-a-0045 266.321000 267.891000 um-hum

sw2293B-ms98-a-0047 281.009875 289.332000 right and it's one of those things i[t's]- i[t's]- it's so hard to measure uh wh[at]- what what the damage is it's it's kind of like uh
sw2293B-ms98-a-0048 289.332000 290.056875 [silence]
sw2293B-ms98-a-0049 290.056875 293.470375 oh i guess it's kind of like kind of like cigarette smoking you know i[t]- it
sw2293B-ms98-a-0050 293.470375 305.309875 it it could go on for years and years until they they s[tart]- start to see some results and people can actually actually say yeah it's it's it's doing it's doing some damage and and something's got to be done
sw2293B-ms98-a-0051 305.309875 310.786750 um there's you know there's a lot of things like that i[t]- it it you can uh
sw2293B-ms98-a-0052 310.786750 318.804125 you can pound on something for a long time before it finally breaks but until it breaks you don't really know that there [laughter] you were doing anything to it
sw2293B-ms98-a-0053 318.804125 320.428500 but uh
sw2293B-ms98-a-0054 320.428500 323.807250 [silence]
sw2293B-ms98-a-0055 323.807250 335.991500 yeah well that's it you know i i i think we both agree it's it's one of those deals that uh i just think there's a lot of other problems right now and uh we've done a lot to take care of it
sw2293B-ms98-a-0056 335.991500 337.812875 and uh
sw2293B-ms98-a-0057 337.812875 351.951125 [silence]
sw2293B-ms98-a-0058 351.951125 353.510625 oh sure
sw2293B-ms98-a-0059 353.510625 354.814875 [silence]
sw2293B-ms98-a-0060 354.814875 356.451250 sure
sw2293B-ms98-a-0061 356.451250 359.819625 [silence]
sw2293B-ms98-a-0062 359.819625 364.758875 oh there's no doubt about i don't know if you if you ever happened to see uh
sw2293B-ms98-a-0063 364.758875 376.569250 some of the like Twenty Twenty and what not about uh Romania and East Germany when they first got pictures out of there about how some of their uh systems had been running for twenty and thirty years
sw2293B-ms98-a-0064 376.569250 386.201750 and uh you know they absolutely no regulations no controls whatsoever and they had destroyed entire forests and what not just because the air was so polluted
sw2293B-ms98-a-0065 386.201750 398.750500 that's that's the kind of things that uh you don't see in this country and that's that's why i think that you know i[t's]- it's i don't know if you can ever do enough but uh
sw2293B-ms98-a-0066 398.750500 404.630625 i think it's all relative to the to the time and place and i think right now it's it's it's pretty much under control
sw2293B-ms98-a-0067 404.630625 406.592750 [silence]
sw2293B-ms98-a-0068 406.592750 408.469625 all righty
