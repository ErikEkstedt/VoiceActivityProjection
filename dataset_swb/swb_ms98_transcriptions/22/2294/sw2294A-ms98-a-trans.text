sw2294A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.703000 [silence]
sw2294A-ms98-a-0002 1.703000 7.751500 okay Jim um can you tell me a little bit about your opinions on capital punishment
sw2294A-ms98-a-0003 7.751500 36.484375 [silence]
sw2294A-ms98-a-0004 36.484375 38.484625 yeah
sw2294A-ms98-a-0005 38.484625 40.990375 [silence]
sw2294A-ms98-a-0006 40.990375 48.794250 well you've you've got a point there but um do you think one appeal is is too stringent
sw2294A-ms98-a-0007 48.794250 55.988000 [silence]
sw2294A-ms98-a-0008 55.988000 57.742375 okay
sw2294A-ms98-a-0009 57.742375 67.490625 now um what do you think about about the death penalty itself do you think that we should have a death penalty
sw2294A-ms98-a-0010 67.490625 116.492125 [silence]
sw2294A-ms98-a-0011 116.492125 123.212000 [laughter] yeah well i kind of think we're too lenient number one
sw2294A-ms98-a-0012 123.212000 133.467250 now i work in Massachusetts but i live in Rhode Island so the the legislature just come out and said that because of what with
sw2294A-ms98-a-0013 133.467250 140.992625 treating the prisoners so-called brutally because uh the state prison's overcrowded we have to release them_1
sw2294A-ms98-a-0014 140.992625 150.974000 so they took the offenders with the the minor crimes and they let them_1 go they didn't have to serve the rest of their term and which is absolutely incredible
sw2294A-ms98-a-0015 150.974000 152.997125 um
sw2294A-ms98-a-0016 152.997125 159.217125 i think number one my opinion is that the judges are too lenient
sw2294A-ms98-a-0017 159.217125 160.453375 [silence]
sw2294A-ms98-a-0018 160.453375 171.772000 but yet you get some of the jury trials and and it comes down to the nitty gritty when people are ready to condemn a person
sw2294A-ms98-a-0019 171.772000 179.496750 they always kind of forgive him a little bit nobody wants to put the finger on somebody and say well that's it you know we're going to kill you
sw2294A-ms98-a-0020 179.496750 189.243750 so it's got to be up to the judges i think we need we have to put into place judges that are stricter than the ones that are in there now
sw2294A-ms98-a-0021 189.243750 198.212625 and the other thing is i'm not sure about Texas but like in Rhode Island if someone breaks into your home
sw2294A-ms98-a-0022 198.212625 209.189125 you have to do your utmost to leave so you can't cause a confrontation with that person you can't shoot him you can't do anything with him i'm not sure what Texas is
sw2294A-ms98-a-0023 209.189125 221.955750 [silence]
sw2294A-ms98-a-0024 221.955750 224.485750 yeah it's
sw2294A-ms98-a-0025 224.485750 226.513875 yeah and ours
sw2294A-ms98-a-0026 226.513875 230.698625 [silence]
sw2294A-ms98-a-0027 230.698625 242.258875 yeah and see in our case it's you have to you have to exit you have to leave and if you have to leave your home to get away from this individual that's what you should do
sw2294A-ms98-a-0028 242.258875 243.778125 so
sw2294A-ms98-a-0029 243.778125 246.308250 what choice have you got
sw2294A-ms98-a-0030 246.308250 249.007625 you know as far as as far as
sw2294A-ms98-a-0031 249.007625 251.288875 our laws go up here
sw2294A-ms98-a-0032 251.288875 262.223500 [silence]
sw2294A-ms98-a-0033 262.223500 264.743875 yeah you're fad[ing]-
sw2294A-ms98-a-0034 264.743875 266.990750 you're fading away Jim
sw2294A-ms98-a-0035 266.990750 267.993375 [silence]
sw2294A-ms98-a-0036 267.993375 269.278500 huh
sw2294A-ms98-a-0037 269.278500 273.503500 [silence]
sw2294A-ms98-a-0038 273.503500 275.495000 that doesn't make any
sw2294A-ms98-a-0039 275.495000 278.429250 [silence]
sw2294A-ms98-a-0040 278.429250 279.959875 right
sw2294A-ms98-a-0041 279.959875 281.229625 right
sw2294A-ms98-a-0042 281.229625 291.255625 and so he was under the influence of narcotics at that time when when the act was was performed but he knows he's going to go back and do the same thing over again
sw2294A-ms98-a-0043 291.255625 294.996375 you know when he's straight so so-called
sw2294A-ms98-a-0044 294.996375 302.509125 so people like that any one i believe you if you murder someone i believe in an eye for an eye
sw2294A-ms98-a-0045 302.509125 304.987500 and i think probably uh
sw2294A-ms98-a-0046 304.987500 310.471750 uh maybe the majority of the people do at least the people that uh that i talk to
sw2294A-ms98-a-0047 310.471750 316.494500 you go out there and you kill somebody you rob a gas station or a drug store and you shoot somebody
sw2294A-ms98-a-0048 316.494500 319.310250 you deserve to be killed also
sw2294A-ms98-a-0049 319.310250 320.494750 [silence]
sw2294A-ms98-a-0050 320.494750 321.995750 right
sw2294A-ms98-a-0051 321.995750 330.684375 right um you're subject to one appeal i- i kind of don't agree with you on that i think probably you should have at least two appeals
sw2294A-ms98-a-0052 330.684375 346.481125 [silence]
sw2294A-ms98-a-0053 346.481125 348.491375 yeah
sw2294A-ms98-a-0054 348.491375 352.923625 [silence]
sw2294A-ms98-a-0055 352.923625 367.767750 that's yeah right common sense has to has to set in some place it's just like uh [noise] uh organized crime now they know all these people they know that the the leaders of organized crime and all that sort of stuff why can't they do something about it
sw2294A-ms98-a-0056 367.767750 374.935125 because they can't if they if they tape something they can't they can't bring it into the court as as evidence
sw2294A-ms98-a-0057 374.935125 376.939250 and they know
sw2294A-ms98-a-0058 376.939250 387.549375 they just had this uh i don't know if it's been in your newspapers but um the guy that got out of prison here to go to a mafia um swearing in ceremony
sw2294A-ms98-a-0059 387.549375 389.748750 and they got uh
sw2294A-ms98-a-0060 389.748750 397.238375 uh somebody and i'm not sure who who it was what organi[zation]- what law enforcement agency
sw2294A-ms98-a-0061 397.238375 405.486625 they got a movable bug a a a court order for a movable bug which means that you can take it any place and put it any where
sw2294A-ms98-a-0062 405.486625 418.299250 and now they're contesting that movable bug because they didn't state that they were going to put it in this particular home where this meeting took place so there's a technicality there but they know outright
sw2294A-ms98-a-0063 418.299250 426.232500 that these people are murderers and whatever else you got and yet they're not going to let that evidence in you know as admissible evidence in court
sw2294A-ms98-a-0064 426.232500 433.480375 so that has to be looked at too um i don't know who they're protecting they're not protecting the innocent that's for sure
sw2294A-ms98-a-0065 433.480375 440.995000 [silence]
sw2294A-ms98-a-0066 440.995000 447.292125 that's true that's true um self-preservation of the species i guess right
sw2294A-ms98-a-0067 447.292125 459.488000 [silence]
sw2294A-ms98-a-0068 459.488000 461.293500 well the
sw2294A-ms98-a-0069 461.293500 465.487375 [silence]

sw2294A-ms98-a-0075 478.499500 481.204125 now the pendulum's going to swing
sw2294A-ms98-a-0076 481.204125 482.221125 [silence]
