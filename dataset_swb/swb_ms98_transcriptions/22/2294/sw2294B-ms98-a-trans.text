sw2294B-ms98-a-0002 7.435750 16.986250 uh the bottom line that i after four years of working with the state prison system i've come to the conclusion if you're going to give the man the death sentence
sw2294B-ms98-a-0003 16.986250 30.499125 go ahead and fulfill the sentence understandably the Supreme Court says any time you hand down a death sentence to somebody they get a one appeal once that appeal fails within thirty days execute sentence
sw2294B-ms98-a-0004 30.499125 36.807250 if you're going to give the man the death sentence don't keep the guy on death row for eight nine ten years and make him worry about it
sw2294B-ms98-a-0005 36.807250 46.235875 plus costing the taxpayers twenty five thousand dollars a year just to keep the guy locked up
sw2294B-ms98-a-0006 46.235875 48.737625 [silence]
sw2294B-ms98-a-0007 48.737625 50.494500 no
sw2294B-ms98-a-0008 50.494500 55.176875 i do not think one appeal is everybody's entitled to one appeal
sw2294B-ms98-a-0009 55.176875 66.761875 [silence]
sw2294B-ms98-a-0010 66.761875 77.986375 absolutely and i wish they would exercise it more thoroughly let the punishment fit the crime in this state we've got a very weird situation going on we're under federal supervision
sw2294B-ms98-a-0011 77.986375 91.967000 and i agree to a point i agree with how the system works in some respects in other ways i don't for first time offenders everybody's entitled to screw up once we'll give them the early release credits we'll give them the good time credits we'll give them the early parole
sw2294B-ms98-a-0012 91.967000 97.985625 second trip down whether it's for the same crime or totally separate one you serve your sentence day for day
sw2294B-ms98-a-0013 97.985625 100.991625 third trip down this is where
sw2294B-ms98-a-0014 100.991625 105.256500 my views on it goes way far beyond what the law states
sw2294B-ms98-a-0015 105.256500 117.488250 third trip down if it's for the same offense or for a totally different one this individual has proven that he does not want to conform to the rules of society so you kill him period end of story
sw2294B-ms98-a-0016 117.488250 208.777125 [silence]
sw2294B-ms98-a-0017 208.777125 218.270750 uh Texas has got it rigged to where i can't sh[oot]- the guy can enter my property and i can't shoot him but once he's physically inside my house
sw2294B-ms98-a-0018 218.270750 231.283250 uh the law reads to where you can defend yourself if you feel your life is being threatened yeah at two o'clock in the morning if somebody's in my living room i feel real threatened so i'm going to come out with guns blazing
sw2294B-ms98-a-0019 231.283250 252.790375 [silence]
sw2294B-ms98-a-0020 252.790375 261.494125 well the the legal system in this country has gone to such extreme measures they've swung so far away from
sw2294B-ms98-a-0021 261.494125 262.514375 [silence]
sw2294B-ms98-a-0022 262.514375 264.994500 there there is no such thing as justice in this
sw2294B-ms98-a-0023 264.994500 267.992875 country anymore we only have situation ethics
sw2294B-ms98-a-0024 267.992875 273.498875 i said yeah the guy robs the liquor store and yeah he shot the owner but he was under the influence of narcotics
sw2294B-ms98-a-0025 273.498875 279.795375 that that should make absolute zero difference you shot the guy you get the death penalty period
sw2294B-ms98-a-0026 279.795375 318.486125 [silence]
sw2294B-ms98-a-0027 318.486125 322.287000 that should be automatic death penalty no if ands or buts 
sw2294B-ms98-a-0028 322.287000 330.233750 [silence]
sw2294B-ms98-a-0029 330.233750 339.262125 but that's what's got our system bogged down so bad now they've appealed everything to where if they've got one typographical error where in their
sw2294B-ms98-a-0030 339.262125 342.757875 in one line instead of spelling
sw2294B-ms98-a-0031 342.757875 353.693750 they've got one word misspelled i mean it's a very minor clerical error they couldn't tell they they'll appeal the hell out of that and that just throws another wrench and it takes two years to work an appeal
sw2294B-ms98-a-0032 353.693750 403.261125 [silence]

sw2294B-ms98-a-0035 430.992750 442.458375 since so people that came up with the laws that made all these loopholes and technicalities take a look at your congressmen and senators you'll find that the vast majority of them are practicing lawyers
sw2294B-ms98-a-0036 442.458375 445.988875 [silence]
sw2294B-ms98-a-0037 445.988875 459.728000 that's it what they don't realize the time is coming and i see it coming over the horizon that the majority of American pe[ople]- people are getting fed up with their BS and are deman[ding]- are going to demand real justice instead of this 
sw2294B-ms98-a-0038 459.728000 465.685250 in Te[xas]- in Texas we're getting to a point where a guy gets a fifteen year sentence he's going to serve fifteen months and he's out
