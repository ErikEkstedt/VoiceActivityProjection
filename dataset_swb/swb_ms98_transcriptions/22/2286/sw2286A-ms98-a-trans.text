sw2286A-ms98-a-0014 41.048500 48.516750 yeah what uh the current climate is i saw a little flyer and uh i thought it was interesting uh
sw2286A-ms98-a-0015 48.516750 51.962875 is they are now offering
sw2286A-ms98-a-0016 51.962875 54.991125 you know flex flexible benefits
sw2286A-ms98-a-0017 54.991125 59.967000 where you have more control and allocate uh like you can
sw2286A-ms98-a-0018 59.967000 69.982500 uh pay for uh vacation time if you want to take more vacation you can just buy them out or something like that so i can
sw2286A-ms98-a-0019 69.982500 72.460375 can do other things and uh
sw2286A-ms98-a-0020 72.460375 81.493000 they actually have a software package that sounds like where you can manipulate different things to see what it costs to you for those benefits
sw2286A-ms98-a-0021 81.493000 85.259750 so it sounds like they're going to get ver[y]- more
sw2286A-ms98-a-0022 85.259750 93.976875 flexible to meet individual needs which i think is the most important thing because everybody is got quite a few different objectives

sw2286A-ms98-a-0041 168.962250 170.705625 uh-huh

sw2286A-ms98-a-0043 180.965250 184.472500 the but the medical stuff itself uh
sw2286A-ms98-a-0044 184.472500 188.343250 the health plan you're with it onl[y]- it only covers fifty percent
sw2286A-ms98-a-0045 188.343250 189.790000 ouch
sw2286A-ms98-a-0046 189.790000 192.500250 that's the worst i've ever heard
sw2286A-ms98-a-0047 192.500250 195.168000 it's usually the eight[y]- basic eighty twenty
sw2286A-ms98-a-0048 195.168000 199.804750 besides your initial deductible that's what varies the most i guess uh
sw2286A-ms98-a-0049 199.804750 201.483125 ha um
sw2286A-ms98-a-0050 201.483125 209.303125 [silence]
sw2286A-ms98-a-0051 209.303125 212.975500 yeah co-payments type stuff

sw2286A-ms98-a-0053 214.260750 221.441500 well i think uh obviously i think the the medical is the most expensive or it's the most important
sw2286A-ms98-a-0054 221.441500 223.740875 uh coverage uh
sw2286A-ms98-a-0055 223.740875 224.702875 [silence]
sw2286A-ms98-a-0056 224.702875 228.238000 of the you know you may not even go in
sw2286A-ms98-a-0057 228.238000 234.191875 to the doctor for a long time but you know if something came up obviously yo[u]- you know to get covered is important
sw2286A-ms98-a-0058 234.191875 235.697750 um
sw2286A-ms98-a-0059 235.697750 251.497875 [silence]
sw2286A-ms98-a-0060 251.497875 253.153500 yeah

sw2286A-ms98-a-0062 257.273125 261.266250 uh-huh how about any matching programs
sw2286A-ms98-a-0063 261.266250 262.752000 you ever
sw2286A-ms98-a-0064 262.752000 271.236500 you know what i mean where they con[tribute]- con[tribute]- contribute like a hundred percent of up to four percent of you salary into a 401K
sw2286A-ms98-a-0065 271.236500 273.489375 [silence]
sw2286A-ms98-a-0066 273.489375 276.990375 is it is it a hundred percent or is it fifty percent
sw2286A-ms98-a-0067 276.990375 279.802000 [silence]
sw2286A-ms98-a-0068 279.802000 280.823875 okay

sw2286A-ms98-a-0071 285.989875 290.487000 but that that's a nice i think that's an important benefit
sw2286A-ms98-a-0072 290.487000 296.474000 uh i don't get that option i i i was at a company that had that and i
sw2286A-ms98-a-0073 296.474000 301.243750 didn't make enough to to be able to put anything in it so i had to leave [laughter] 
sw2286A-ms98-a-0074 301.243750 302.483875 [silence]
sw2286A-ms98-a-0075 302.483875 303.994750 so
sw2286A-ms98-a-0076 303.994750 305.964750 but uh
sw2286A-ms98-a-0077 305.964750 322.745875 [silence]
sw2286A-ms98-a-0078 322.745875 323.998375 uh-huh
sw2286A-ms98-a-0079 323.998375 326.495750 [silence]
sw2286A-ms98-a-0080 326.495750 328.777375 with an annuity
sw2286A-ms98-a-0081 328.777375 329.994250 yeah
sw2286A-ms98-a-0082 329.994250 332.490000 [silence]
sw2286A-ms98-a-0083 332.490000 333.990625 [laughter]
sw2286A-ms98-a-0084 333.990625 334.998875 [silence]
sw2286A-ms98-a-0085 334.998875 339.499250 i i the only reason i know a little bit about that is
sw2286A-ms98-a-0086 339.499250 342.711500 when i was in school still
sw2286A-ms98-a-0087 342.711500 346.256625 i was down in Florida working and
sw2286A-ms98-a-0088 346.256625 349.723375 uh dur[ing]- during the summer
sw2286A-ms98-a-0089 349.723375 351.950875 some how i got a hold of
sw2286A-ms98-a-0090 351.950875 357.273375 involved in a a marketing organization that marketed
sw2286A-ms98-a-0091 357.273375 369.008500 uh replacing those uh whole life policies which aren't very good insurance policies people are losing you know and it losing money or not doing as well as they could
sw2286A-ms98-a-0092 369.008500 370.954625 and uh
sw2286A-ms98-a-0093 370.954625 380.469000 the whole organization was targeting to replace whole life policies with a term life with annu[ity]- an annuity and uh
sw2286A-ms98-a-0094 380.469000 385.248625 they would uh you know analyze it
sw2286A-ms98-a-0095 385.248625 390.982375 the person's current policy and get a compu[terized]- computerized you know statement of
sw2286A-ms98-a-0096 390.982375 402.493875 uh what would happen you know at this age this age this age you know uh what your benefits would be and uh the difference between you know the the term life with annuity and the whole life 
sw2286A-ms98-a-0097 402.493875 411.754625 was you know there's fairly big dis[crepancies]- discrepancies you know so they could try to replace those so i got involved uh on that end
sw2286A-ms98-a-0098 411.754625 418.492875 and picked it up but i never did tell anyone back at school and i never i never uh did anything with it but
sw2286A-ms98-a-0099 418.492875 426.762250 uh so i know a little about_1 uh the right now i just do a little basic life thing on my benefits but
sw2286A-ms98-a-0100 426.762250 439.982750 you know i don't know what i get out maybe twenty thou[sands]- or something just to cover me and cover some expenses and maybe fly people out that i know you know some family that but uh i'm not worried about that i don't have anybody to to
sw2286A-ms98-a-0101 439.982750 450.997375 yeah well i like the idea of having that chunk of money uh to help anybody cover my end you know you don't want to be a burden to anybody else uh
sw2286A-ms98-a-0102 450.997375 452.791250 and uh
sw2286A-ms98-a-0103 452.791250 454.510375 so i think
sw2286A-ms98-a-0104 454.510375 455.901125 [silence]
sw2286A-ms98-a-0105 455.901125 464.538625 yeah i mean i'm not looking to to leave anything there may be a a certain amount uh and you know that's fine but uh 
sw2286A-ms98-a-0106 464.538625 470.475250 uh you know to get that coverage and know that i'll get you know
sw2286A-ms98-a-0107 470.475250 472.275375 uh
sw2286A-ms98-a-0108 472.275375 480.487625 you know flown to wherever i need you know already i need to go i guess i haven't made any decisions like that i guess you know my family and father would do that but uh
sw2286A-ms98-a-0109 480.487625 491.248250 see i've i've kind of moved around from my home originally and [vocalized-noise] um my family's out in Florida now most of my family and i'm out here in Phoenix so 
sw2286A-ms98-a-0110 491.248250 494.679375 but uh anyway as far as benefits um
sw2286A-ms98-a-0111 494.679375 499.481000 what else is im[portant]- important uh obviously i think uh
sw2286A-ms98-a-0112 499.481000 502.735250 a profit sharing is is uh
sw2286A-ms98-a-0113 502.735250 509.692250 is a important benefit especially in the long run for the long term 
sw2286A-ms98-a-0114 509.692250 511.246750 um
sw2286A-ms98-a-0115 511.246750 529.435750 [silence]
sw2286A-ms98-a-0116 529.435750 532.489250 yeah there's the smaller the the companies it's either 
sw2286A-ms98-a-0117 532.489250 534.991250 the smaller company
sw2286A-ms98-a-0118 534.991250 544.479875 yo[u]- yo[u]- you're in to into the consulting side and they'll you'll finish up a project and you'll get the little bonus that type of thing
sw2286A-ms98-a-0119 544.479875 548.765750 um i guess you could technically consider that profit sharing
sw2286A-ms98-a-0120 548.765750 550.494375 um
sw2286A-ms98-a-0121 550.494375 555.473500 but um most you know most medium or small
sw2286A-ms98-a-0122 555.473500 557.145875 probably don't
sw2286A-ms98-a-0123 557.145875 559.794750 do that much profit sharing
sw2286A-ms98-a-0124 559.794750 566.311625 and while i was at this other corporation they never had any profit so
sw2286A-ms98-a-0125 566.311625 568.976250 [silence]
sw2286A-ms98-a-0126 568.976250 574.228250 yeah [laughter] they couldn't share any and i guess they had a little bit one year but
sw2286A-ms98-a-0127 574.228250 579.499125 i wasn't qu[alified]- qualified for my first year something you know after
sw2286A-ms98-a-0128 579.499125 580.986500 [silence]
sw2286A-ms98-a-0129 580.986500 582.000375 so

sw2286A-ms98-a-0131 585.295750 587.440375 little over three years now
