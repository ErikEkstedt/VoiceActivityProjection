sw2246A-ms98-a-0017 115.051625 129.485625 wow um-hum well do they i mean um i never liked doing that and i- i didn't up until uh several years ago when it came down to the point of
sw2246A-ms98-a-0018 129.485625 137.958750 y[ou]- you don't have a choice you know if you if you need to have a car then you have no choice and uh
sw2246A-ms98-a-0019 137.958750 141.502750 and uh i[t]- it gets even worse when you think about trying to do things like buy a house
sw2246A-ms98-a-0020 141.502750 145.963875 [silence]
sw2246A-ms98-a-0021 145.963875 149.499375 really i mean [laughter] so what choice do you have then
sw2246A-ms98-a-0022 149.499375 160.730875 [silence]
sw2246A-ms98-a-0023 160.730875 164.692000 yeah i did it's just that uh
sw2246A-ms98-a-0024 164.692000 172.726000 there needs to be some some change take place so that the inertia can begin to go in a different direction and strike down
sw2246A-ms98-a-0025 172.726000 176.531625 you know that's the problem that i think we have
sw2246A-ms98-a-0026 176.531625 189.102000 [silence]
sw2246A-ms98-a-0027 189.102000 190.196250 um-hum

sw2246A-ms98-a-0036 217.712750 222.702250 well we were we were in debt before that it just wasn't as apparent
sw2246A-ms98-a-0037 222.702250 225.727375 [silence]
sw2246A-ms98-a-0038 225.727375 227.184000 somehow we still
sw2246A-ms98-a-0039 227.184000 232.899250 i guess believed that the countries that we were helping were were eventually going to pay us back
sw2246A-ms98-a-0040 232.899250 234.326125 and that hasn't happened
sw2246A-ms98-a-0041 234.326125 255.176750 [silence]
sw2246A-ms98-a-0042 255.176750 256.292875 um-hum
sw2246A-ms98-a-0043 256.292875 261.308250 [silence]
sw2246A-ms98-a-0044 261.308250 264.573125 oh that's true i hadn't thought of it that way i think
sw2246A-ms98-a-0045 264.573125 288.131625 [silence]
sw2246A-ms98-a-0046 288.131625 289.922750 yeah that's true
sw2246A-ms98-a-0047 289.922750 295.977125 [silence]
sw2246A-ms98-a-0048 295.977125 297.491000 yeah that's true
sw2246A-ms98-a-0049 297.491000 310.859250 [silence]
sw2246A-ms98-a-0050 310.859250 311.972125 yeah
sw2246A-ms98-a-0051 311.972125 313.217250 [silence]
sw2246A-ms98-a-0052 313.217250 321.817000 yeah in some in some cases it uh i think it's actually going to you know the people that it's intended for in other cases
sw2246A-ms98-a-0053 321.817000 331.887625 uh and and this is all based and this is all up to actually the government that's in control now in some cases the the money actually does filter down to the to where it's
sw2246A-ms98-a-0054 331.887625 336.801750 supposed to get to and in other cases it it does not
sw2246A-ms98-a-0055 336.801750 342.566750 [silence]
sw2246A-ms98-a-0056 342.566750 343.479000 yeah
sw2246A-ms98-a-0057 343.479000 347.807875 [silence]
sw2246A-ms98-a-0058 347.807875 348.875500 yeah
sw2246A-ms98-a-0059 348.875500 355.341750 [silence]
sw2246A-ms98-a-0060 355.341750 368.524750 i don't really have a good solution for the budget thing either except for that um i know that they're trying to be they're that they're supposedly trying to be fair with taxes and by making it more equal
sw2246A-ms98-a-0061 368.524750 370.192000 but
sw2246A-ms98-a-0062 370.192000 373.932125 i can't really understand why
sw2246A-ms98-a-0063 373.932125 381.295875 um it has to be the same percentage where you have someone that makes
sw2246A-ms98-a-0064 381.295875 391.690000 um a very low amount of money the same percentage may affect them thirty five or forty times more severely than the same percentage
sw2246A-ms98-a-0065 391.690000 405.312875 of someone's well -[i]f if they earn a great deal of money and i would being somewhere in the middle feel like that it would be a lot more fair to have a little more heavily weighted
sw2246A-ms98-a-0066 405.312875 413.258000 toward the top end if i- i can put my you know i think to myself if i had that much money
sw2246A-ms98-a-0067 413.258000 417.358500 i could afford to pay more taxes it wouldn't bother me a bit
sw2246A-ms98-a-0068 417.358500 428.638125 [silence]
sw2246A-ms98-a-0069 428.638125 434.645375 yeah they used to have and what do they i don't know what the percentage is now they used to be taxed thirty percent
sw2246A-ms98-a-0070 434.645375 441.428375 and i remember hearing an interview with uh who was it the man who invented Hawaiian Tropic
sw2246A-ms98-a-0071 441.428375 448.551875 you know and he he was talking about that he was talking about nobody went broke over paying thirty percent
sw2246A-ms98-a-0072 448.551875 450.036000 [silence]
sw2246A-ms98-a-0073 450.036000 451.060375 you know
sw2246A-ms98-a-0074 451.060375 454.941500 [silence]
sw2246A-ms98-a-0075 454.941500 456.319875 well that's
sw2246A-ms98-a-0076 456.319875 467.655375 they they get we[ll]- it it depends on how you look at that because like Sweden they pay a lot in taxes but their day care is government subsidized
sw2246A-ms98-a-0077 467.655375 476.663625 women who want to stay home with their children are subsidized to do that they don't have to live um
sw2246A-ms98-a-0078 476.663625 486.241625 hand to mouth because it the government there and the country there has placed a very significant value on motherhood
sw2246A-ms98-a-0079 486.241625 489.643750 [silence]
sw2246A-ms98-a-0080 489.643750 501.227875 um-hum i think we could learn some things from and the and the health care system you may pay more in taxes but your health care is taken care of and you don't have the corruption and in uh
sw2246A-ms98-a-0081 501.227875 502.948500 [silence]
sw2246A-ms98-a-0082 502.948500 507.292500 medicine that that we have here with the the outrageous charges and
sw2246A-ms98-a-0083 507.292500 525.807000 [silence]
sw2246A-ms98-a-0084 525.807000 526.786375 hum

sw2246A-ms98-a-0087 531.907750 534.228000 [silence]
sw2246A-ms98-a-0088 534.228000 537.555250 yeah i think that if we could model
sw2246A-ms98-a-0089 537.555250 550.096000 you know programs after those that are already i mean they did a lot of work finding a program that worked and if we were to do the research take under advisement what they have
sw2246A-ms98-a-0090 550.096000 553.516500 already working and adapt it
sw2246A-ms98-a-0091 553.516500 564.678750 tha[t]- that that particular day care system um works very well and the Canadian health plan is probably the best one in existence today
