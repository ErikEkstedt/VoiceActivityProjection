sw2246B-ms98-a-0003 3.371625 11.946625 well i'm m[ore]- more interested in the long-term effects than the short-term effects in terms of uh balancing budget and so forth um
sw2246B-ms98-a-0004 11.946625 20.468375 i tend to view um and i- i take a fairly radical view towards economic policy and feel that
sw2246B-ms98-a-0005 20.468375 32.605875 well it has to be done somewhat arbitrarily at uh on in some uh instances i think that um goods should cost um real total costs rather than just manufacturing costs 
sw2246B-ms98-a-0006 32.605875 46.200375 and that means uh if you oh produce something that creates uh uh adverse health effects that should somehow be reflected in the product if you uh the cost of
sw2246B-ms98-a-0007 46.200375 51.171750 forestry that you cut down and such needs to be uh reflected
sw2246B-ms98-a-0008 51.171750 52.339250 in
sw2246B-ms98-a-0009 52.339250 53.457875 [silence]
sw2246B-ms98-a-0010 53.457875 61.235875 well i think i think my long-term sense of of budget concerns is that we're going is
sw2246B-ms98-a-0011 61.235875 74.067125 a lot of others government's spending goes on goes towards this uh health care and things like that and a lot of causes of poor health or need for health care are
sw2246B-ms98-a-0012 74.067125 83.553625 brought about by various factors such as such as pollution stress you know work work environment conditions and so forth but generally the government is
sw2246B-ms98-a-0013 83.553625 89.449375 government or individuals end up paying for that rather than the uh some of the source of need for the health care
sw2246B-ms98-a-0014 89.449375 91.267625 [silence]
sw2246B-ms98-a-0015 91.267625 95.661000 um but that's a very long-term sort of concern
sw2246B-ms98-a-0016 95.661000 106.470250 um i don't i don't have great short-term effects other than reducing spending and raising taxes and no one likes the idea of raising taxes very much and uh
sw2246B-ms98-a-0017 106.470250 119.799125 no one likes the idea of reducing spending very much so i don't see any real uh real immediate hope i mean it's the whole quota's living on debt i mean but and they buy things on credits constantly

sw2246B-ms98-a-0026 151.762125 162.243250 [laughter] i mean it seems to me one might have choices if one radically restructured the system but that's not really a possibility at this point it has it's own inertia and

sw2246B-ms98-a-0030 183.543500 194.528500 back so severely um at least in California where i am where there's a very severe budget crisis because_1 of agriculture was wiped out last year and um a number of other things and uh
sw2246B-ms98-a-0031 194.528500 202.644625 because_1 i'm i- i have a lot of i have some personal investments in this uh in addition to whatever philosophical investment
sw2246B-ms98-a-0032 202.644625 211.063500 there is and i don't know it's amazing that in the last ten years we've gone from a uh a major loaning nation to a major debt nation
sw2246B-ms98-a-0033 211.063500 217.124625 in the in the course of a decade um we are [vocalized-noise] a lot has changed more radically 
sw2246B-ms98-a-0034 217.124625 218.408750 and
sw2246B-ms98-a-0035 218.408750 222.135625 [silence]
sw2246B-ms98-a-0036 222.135625 226.845875 yeah it was it's it's uh seems to have worsened considerably [noise]

sw2246B-ms98-a-0038 233.841125 241.693375 um-hum um-hum yeah well uh i can see you know it's it's it's
sw2246B-ms98-a-0039 241.693375 251.281750 it's kind of funny because we it seems like we loan money you know we money with strings attached and if the government changes and the country that we loan the money to
sw2246B-ms98-a-0040 251.281750 262.346500 um i can see why the might have a different attitude towards paying it back it's a lot us that [vocalized-noise] you know we don't really loan money to to countries we loan money to governments and it's th[e]-
sw2246B-ms98-a-0041 262.346500 272.569625 and it's the governments it's the governments sh[ould]- that that's really what we do you don't go up to the country you talk to the president or the chair or whatever of some group and you loan it to these people who are representing the government
sw2246B-ms98-a-0042 272.569625 277.429500 and by extension representing the country but when those people are gone and you have some new
sw2246B-ms98-a-0043 277.429500 283.669875 you know starving third world country with a brand new government that threw the previous rascals out um
sw2246B-ms98-a-0044 283.669875 297.748375 they're personal incentive for repaying that debt is understandably low [laughter] because_1 it's they didn't they didn't borr[ow]- i mean you know it would be like you paying off the debts of uh some neighbors of yours you wouldn't feel very happy about it [laughter]
sw2246B-ms98-a-0045 297.748375 299.086500 um
sw2246B-ms98-a-0046 299.086500 303.248125 so it's a sort of like this is uh [vocalized-noise] i see a [vocalized-noise]
sw2246B-ms98-a-0047 303.248125 311.470250 i don't know there's if there's a metaphor going on who are we loaning the money to and people can disagree about who that money is being loaned to

sw2246B-ms98-a-0053 336.420375 343.108625 yeah i- i- i tend to get a little upset about loans to coun[tries]- to obviously corrupt governments um
sw2246B-ms98-a-0054 343.108625 354.358750 there a number of them for political reasons because we're enemies of the neighboring government or something like that so we give them an either corrupt government anyway but it's hard to view that so much as a loan as a bribe at that point [laughter]

sw2246B-ms98-a-0103 575.539250 583.420375 which is uh uh a propaganda phrase used a lot against exactly such types of spending programs and um
sw2246B-ms98-a-0104 583.420375 591.994875 you usually say creeping socialism to conjure up fears of bread lines in Moscow um but if you use i mean this creeping
