sw2235A-ms98-a-0002 1.193250 2.325375 hi
sw2235A-ms98-a-0003 2.325375 4.525000 okay you wanna start
sw2235A-ms98-a-0004 4.525000 17.234250 [silence]
sw2235A-ms98-a-0005 17.234250 22.643125 that is very true however our whole economy is based on loans
sw2235A-ms98-a-0006 22.643125 30.035375 uh uh but but right this moment you probably have several loans out or you have borrowed money against your credit card or something
sw2235A-ms98-a-0007 30.035375 31.649375 master charge
sw2235A-ms98-a-0008 31.649375 35.334125 [silence]
sw2235A-ms98-a-0009 35.334125 40.507250 but uh see that our whole system is built on on owing on borrowing
sw2235A-ms98-a-0010 40.507250 46.064875 [silence]
sw2235A-ms98-a-0011 46.064875 54.047000 uh true but uh uh uh without it people wouldn't be able to own automobiles or they wouldn't be able to own a house
sw2235A-ms98-a-0012 54.047000 115.667375 [silence]
sw2235A-ms98-a-0013 115.667375 122.089750 well now i agree and uh i agree with you one hundred percent i'm just taking the other side just so we'll have a discussion 
sw2235A-ms98-a-0014 122.089750 123.373625 here
sw2235A-ms98-a-0015 123.373625 131.341875 uh but i still go right back to what i said when is the last time you had uh fifteen thousand dollars all at one time to go out and buy an automobile
sw2235A-ms98-a-0016 131.341875 139.971500 [silence]
sw2235A-ms98-a-0017 139.971500 141.427250 um-hum
sw2235A-ms98-a-0018 141.427250 192.026375 [silence]
sw2235A-ms98-a-0019 192.026375 193.224875 uh-huh
sw2235A-ms98-a-0020 193.224875 211.826875 [silence]
sw2235A-ms98-a-0021 211.826875 215.312375 well i have one way to suggest reducing the budget
sw2235A-ms98-a-0022 215.312375 216.925500 very simple
sw2235A-ms98-a-0023 216.925500 226.206375 just take all these civil service employees and and uh uh take some of those holidays away from them_1 like Columbus Day President's Day
sw2235A-ms98-a-0024 226.206375 230.116000 i mean they g[et]- they get all these days off now give them_1
sw2235A-ms98-a-0025 230.116000 235.117125 what a a week i think we here at TI get a total of eleven a year
sw2235A-ms98-a-0026 235.117125 240.812125 and that's about uh three or four less than civil servants get
sw2235A-ms98-a-0027 240.812125 247.054875 now just look at that money the government could save if they didn't have all of those days off all those holidays
sw2235A-ms98-a-0028 247.054875 254.137000 [silence]
sw2235A-ms98-a-0029 254.137000 259.654500 well now don't forget the mail is something else again that has nothing they're not civil servant people
sw2235A-ms98-a-0030 259.654500 261.602750 [silence]
sw2235A-ms98-a-0031 261.602750 264.544000 no no they have their own budget they go by
sw2235A-ms98-a-0032 264.544000 267.027250 [silence]
sw2235A-ms98-a-0033 267.027250 271.496875 no you know that's why [vocalized-noise] the price of mailing a letter keeps going up 
sw2235A-ms98-a-0034 271.496875 272.531000 [silence]
sw2235A-ms98-a-0035 272.531000 273.805000 you know i could
sw2235A-ms98-a-0036 273.805000 278.912000 i can remember the days when it only cost three cents to mail uh uh uh a letter
sw2235A-ms98-a-0037 278.912000 280.295875 [silence]
sw2235A-ms98-a-0038 280.295875 284.184125 yeah [laughter] they probably hey i ought to go looking through some of my old mail
sw2235A-ms98-a-0039 284.184125 357.743750 [silence]
sw2235A-ms98-a-0040 357.743750 364.595000 well what about uh uh sending all this money overseas supporting other governments third world governments
sw2235A-ms98-a-0041 364.595000 366.346500 how do you feel about that
sw2235A-ms98-a-0042 366.346500 381.158500 [silence]
sw2235A-ms98-a-0043 381.158500 385.816750 well in so many cases it's not a loan it's just a g[ive]- a giveaway
sw2235A-ms98-a-0044 385.816750 466.883375 [silence]
sw2235A-ms98-a-0045 466.883375 472.322625 no that that's true i- i understand that France still owes us money from World War I
sw2235A-ms98-a-0046 472.322625 479.285500 and uh World War II debts have never been repaid i think the US just wrote them all off
sw2235A-ms98-a-0047 479.285500 484.485500 and said well we'll cancel it just like they did to the that Polish debt here uh last week
sw2235A-ms98-a-0048 484.485500 485.644625 [silence]
sw2235A-ms98-a-0049 485.644625 491.338625 uh uh half the countries in the world simply canceled the Poland debts
sw2235A-ms98-a-0050 491.338625 492.989625 to help them
sw2235A-ms98-a-0051 492.989625 511.261125 [silence]
sw2235A-ms98-a-0052 511.261125 516.785375 uh-huh well uh i've got to respect your opinion you have some uh solid ideas
sw2235A-ms98-a-0053 516.785375 519.807000 [silence]
sw2235A-ms98-a-0054 519.807000 524.458375 well i don't believe in a single government or a single control for the world
sw2235A-ms98-a-0055 524.458375 527.177750 uh that's
sw2235A-ms98-a-0056 527.177750 530.537000 asking for trouble people are too different
sw2235A-ms98-a-0057 530.537000 539.726125 i mean you could travel from one coast to the other here in the US and find tremendous differences between the peoples they have their own ideas how things should be run
sw2235A-ms98-a-0058 539.726125 549.093125 so therefore i don't believe there could be a single government for the whole world there's too many societies involved uh the language barriers
sw2235A-ms98-a-0059 549.093125 555.029625 uh oh sure th[ey]- somebody said years ago well let's make it English uh an international
sw2235A-ms98-a-0060 555.029625 556.966375 uh language
sw2235A-ms98-a-0061 556.966375 562.525000 that's a big laugh we can't even make English a a national language here in our country
sw2235A-ms98-a-0062 562.525000 563.557375 [silence]
sw2235A-ms98-a-0063 563.557375 565.788250 we've got too many uh uh
sw2235A-ms98-a-0064 565.788250 567.555250 uh immigrants
sw2235A-ms98-a-0065 567.555250 568.596125 [silence]
sw2235A-ms98-a-0066 568.596125 572.890375 they don't call them immigrants anymore that was back during my granddaddy's day
sw2235A-ms98-a-0067 572.890375 575.233875 [silence]
sw2235A-ms98-a-0068 575.233875 578.629250 a [vocalized-noise] well yes yeah but uh 
sw2235A-ms98-a-0069 578.629250 580.156250 [silence]
sw2235A-ms98-a-0070 580.156250 584.611250 my grandfather came over from Lithuania back uh just before the turn of the century
sw2235A-ms98-a-0071 584.611250 585.810125 [silence]
sw2235A-ms98-a-0072 585.810125 589.367000 and uh as a matter of fact he's a draft dodger
sw2235A-ms98-a-0073 589.367000 596.003625 he uh was supposed to serve some time well he did serve his time in in the uh the militia
sw2235A-ms98-a-0074 596.003625 600.699375 and he came back he was a civilian again and his father said well if you
