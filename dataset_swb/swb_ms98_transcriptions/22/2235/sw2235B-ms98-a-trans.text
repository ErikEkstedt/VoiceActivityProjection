sw2235B-ms98-a-0006 4.512375 14.143375 um yeah sure um i think i think we should have a balanced budget even if it means that services are dramatically cut back
sw2235B-ms98-a-0007 14.143375 17.323250 if you can't pay for it you shouldn't have it period
sw2235B-ms98-a-0008 17.323250 18.560250 and
sw2235B-ms98-a-0009 18.560250 19.608375 that's just

sw2235B-ms98-a-0014 31.225375 32.625250 [laughter]
sw2235B-ms98-a-0015 32.625250 35.395750 i don't have a master charge thank you [laughter]
sw2235B-ms98-a-0016 35.395750 38.444000 [silence]
sw2235B-ms98-a-0017 38.444000 47.115750 right but that's the problem see as our system shouldn't be based on owing and borrowing and all that
sw2235B-ms98-a-0018 47.115750 54.067000 [silence]
sw2235B-ms98-a-0019 54.067000 60.885625 yes they would they just wouldn't be able to own the kind of automobiles that they think they deserve to own
sw2235B-ms98-a-0020 60.885625 71.746000 or the kind of homes that we think we deserve to own we might have to you know just be able to i think if we a generation went without debt
sw2235B-ms98-a-0021 71.746000 77.100125 then the next generation like if if our our generation my husband and i we're twenty eight
sw2235B-ms98-a-0022 77.100125 84.204750 if we lived our lives and didn't become you know indebted like you know our generation before us
sw2235B-ms98-a-0023 84.204750 90.668250 that um the budget would balance and that we became accustomed to living with what we could afford
sw2235B-ms98-a-0024 90.668250 99.279875 which we wouldn't be destitute i mean we wouldn't be living on the street by any means but just compared to how spoiled we are we would be in our own minds
sw2235B-ms98-a-0025 99.279875 104.930625 but i feel like the generation after us w[ould]- oh man it i would be so good 
sw2235B-ms98-a-0026 104.930625 112.080000 it would be so much better it wouldn't be perfect but then they could learn to live with wh[at]- what they could afford to save to buy
sw2235B-ms98-a-0027 112.080000 115.868125 and if you want a nicer car than that well you save a little longer
sw2235B-ms98-a-0028 115.868125 117.264000 [silence]
sw2235B-ms98-a-0029 117.264000 118.109875 uh-huh

sw2235B-ms98-a-0033 131.906500 140.887625 but see i we made poor choices in college we took out two both of us had twenty thousand dollars in loans for student loans
sw2235B-ms98-a-0034 140.887625 147.882375 and i look back on that and i bought shoes i went shopping i did not need that money i did not need it
sw2235B-ms98-a-0035 147.882375 159.003000 i didn't need it i shouldn't have even qualified to get it i didn't need it and it would have been a little rough i might have eaten some bologna instead of roast beef out of the deli but i did not need it
sw2235B-ms98-a-0036 159.003000 168.457125 and as i look back now now we're paying that back i told my son if you have to live in the ghetto to go to college do it but don't take out ten thousand dollars in loans
sw2235B-ms98-a-0037 168.457125 173.666500 don't do it and i don't i hope don't think he'll have to do that but i just
sw2235B-ms98-a-0038 173.666500 184.112625 so like we might if we didn't have those loans we could have saved in the last five years the money for that and i believe we would have because God's really put it in our heart not to get in debt you know
sw2235B-ms98-a-0039 184.112625 192.085250 but we have friends at church that do this on a constant basis that are totally debt free and they pay cash for everything they buy
sw2235B-ms98-a-0040 192.085250 194.811125 including new vans and so
sw2235B-ms98-a-0041 194.811125 198.876625 so i guess i've seen it done and i know you can do it you know
sw2235B-ms98-a-0042 198.876625 203.737750 but you have to drive that old car until you get that money saved up for that new van
sw2235B-ms98-a-0043 203.737750 212.319125 and that's where Americans don't like to do it and so and we don't want to cut back our services from the government because we're spoiled

sw2235B-ms98-a-0060 248.242750 252.852375 because_1 i always think the mail never comes on these days and you're like well what is it [laughter]

sw2235B-ms98-a-0065 264.091500 267.660375 but isn't it part of our in[come]- it's not part of our taxes
sw2235B-ms98-a-0066 267.660375 268.785375 it's not

sw2235B-ms98-a-0068 270.658500 273.909500 that's why it keeps [laughter-going] [laughter-up] huh that's another topic 
sw2235B-ms98-a-0069 273.909500 274.776375 [laughter]
sw2235B-ms98-a-0070 274.776375 278.454750 [silence]
sw2235B-ms98-a-0071 278.454750 280.740875 those stamps are valuable now
sw2235B-ms98-a-0072 280.740875 283.836125 [laughter]
sw2235B-ms98-a-0073 283.836125 289.862625 that's funny yeah and that is a good short term thing though that little things like that
sw2235B-ms98-a-0074 289.862625 296.321375 that overall though i just think we're just going to i don't know see i know i guess i'm kind of leery of this topic because 
sw2235B-ms98-a-0075 296.321375 305.649750 i know that Bush is real for the new world order the one world government and alleviating all you know national debt between all of the nations but i see that to
sw2235B-ms98-a-0076 305.649750 311.842125 be a potential power problem later with um who's going to be in charge with this new world order
sw2235B-ms98-a-0077 311.842125 326.099750 and i you know i'm uncomfortable with that much power being in one place but i know we already have a new money sys[tem]- we already have new bills printed for [vocalized-noise] US Treasury already has our new bills printed for new currency and i mean i've seen them_1 [laughter] 
sw2235B-ms98-a-0078 326.099750 334.355000 and so i know that the long-term vision for the US government is to alleviate all national debts and to start over afresh
sw2235B-ms98-a-0079 334.355000 340.751375 but i'm concerned with whose going to have the power over this new world order that they keep talking about you know
sw2235B-ms98-a-0080 340.751375 344.263750 that's a lot of power for one or two people to have
sw2235B-ms98-a-0081 344.263750 350.793375 and so um i guess because_1 i- i guess i feel like i know what their long-term vision is i'm kind of like
sw2235B-ms98-a-0082 350.793375 358.465875 you know yeah the only answer is to start over or to totally change our lifestyles and i don't think Americans are willing to do it
sw2235B-ms98-a-0083 358.465875 366.286625 [silence]
sw2235B-ms98-a-0084 366.286625 372.620750 i don't i don't feel we should loan them money if i- i wish our leaders were really seeking the Lord on these things
sw2235B-ms98-a-0085 372.620750 382.143000 and if we feel led to give a country money to help them fine but i don't feel we should be loaning money like that i mean it doesn't work are they gonna
sw2235B-ms98-a-0086 382.143000 385.085625 [silence]
sw2235B-ms98-a-0087 385.085625 390.948375 but it's not but it's not set up as a giveaway if it were set up as a giveaway and it was something that 
sw2235B-ms98-a-0088 390.948375 401.285250 i mean our our President and our leaders could be seeking God saying God is it your will for us to bless this nation with this money is it your will this money and your will for us to give to them
sw2235B-ms98-a-0089 401.285250 415.652000 and i believe if we gave it no strings attached that God would bless our nation but because we're our motive is interest our motive is not pure it just backfires i mean none of these nations have paid us back
sw2235B-ms98-a-0090 415.652000 424.817875 it be do you understand it's i guess it's a principle of giving and receiving you give it no strings attached and they may never give you anything back but
sw2235B-ms98-a-0091 424.817875 434.695750 because there's no strings attached it like gives them a freedom to give us something back and it might not be money it might be um no taxes on our things
sw2235B-ms98-a-0092 434.695750 444.763500 our computers going into their nation it might come back in another way but it would be come back but because we're loaning it i think that's the problem and i don't mean give it to everybody that asks
sw2235B-ms98-a-0093 444.763500 448.303625 use a lot of discernment don't give money to every nation
sw2235B-ms98-a-0094 448.303625 451.992125 you know what i'm saying i think we're loaning money to too many nations
sw2235B-ms98-a-0095 451.992125 459.369000 but i think if we gave to a few select ones that really needed it that it would work out better for us and for them
sw2235B-ms98-a-0096 459.369000 466.848875 and so now we have all these nations that owe us all this money and so i just think we're never going to get that back you know
sw2235B-ms98-a-0097 466.848875 468.191375 do you understand
