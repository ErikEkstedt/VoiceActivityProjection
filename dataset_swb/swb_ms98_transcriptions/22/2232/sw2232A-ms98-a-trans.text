sw2232A-ms98-a-0018 68.813625 70.438125 no i didn't
sw2232A-ms98-a-0019 70.438125 74.454750 but i- i did read the book i ha[ve]- do have i have six years of college
sw2232A-ms98-a-0020 74.454750 80.120000 so i did read and study about the Vietnam War though so i am pretty fa[miliar]- you know i'm more familiar with it than
sw2232A-ms98-a-0021 80.120000 81.337000 [silence]
sw2232A-ms98-a-0022 81.337000 88.437500 mine i think uh i think that there was a lot of rebellion in our nation and that
sw2232A-ms98-a-0023 88.437500 95.683375 i think it was the right thing to do to try and not to take away to you know just leave their freedoms there
sw2232A-ms98-a-0024 95.683375 99.519875 and to you know get rid of some of the atrocities that were going on
sw2232A-ms98-a-0025 99.519875 104.673125 i don't i don't know i don't really i'm tired of pacifist though see on the other hand
sw2232A-ms98-a-0026 104.673125 110.039375 i'm a pac[ifist]- i'm really struggling with it i'm a pacifist physical pacifist i'm a Christian
sw2232A-ms98-a-0027 110.039375 116.469000 and i believe that the real warfare is not with Saddam Hussein or the North Vietnamese but it's in spiritual kingdoms
sw2232A-ms98-a-0028 116.469000 120.972250 and that the real warfare is done you know in your prayer closet on your knees so
sw2232A-ms98-a-0029 120.972250 125.087500 in a way in a sense i'm a pacifist but i'm really not you know what i'm saying
sw2232A-ms98-a-0030 125.087500 132.388750 i don't think just lay back and not do anything i think lets go to war but let's go to war praying and let's go to war for that way so

sw2232A-ms98-a-0044 183.384875 190.520750 still have a problem with uh you know i haven't come to an absolute conclusion on my opinion on this but
sw2232A-ms98-a-0045 190.520750 197.403125 and i know other Christians would disagree with me my husband and i are kind of not even in agreement on this but we don't fight over it or anything but
sw2232A-ms98-a-0046 197.403125 206.864875 you know how can you know the Bible says bless your enemies and bless those that curse you and it's like be gentle unto all men apt to teach patient kind so it's like how can you
sw2232A-ms98-a-0047 206.864875 213.802375 i don't know for me i don't know you know i can't say that i agree with Vietnam because how can you be gentle unto all men and
sw2232A-ms98-a-0048 213.802375 215.469750 and then shoot them_1
sw2232A-ms98-a-0049 215.469750 217.015000 you so

sw2232A-ms98-a-0055 237.608750 242.859125 yeah it is a difficult thing but then vengeance is mine sayeth the Lord and i will pay
sw2232A-ms98-a-0056 242.859125 245.199000 so i think God ultimately in charge of
sw2232A-ms98-a-0057 245.199000 252.871625 what goes on in i know like Mao Tse Chung in China he did all these terrible things and they were terrible and he's gonna be accountable for them
sw2232A-ms98-a-0058 252.871625 260.363500 and but if you look back you say wait a minute while he was in power he built roads he tore down all the temples he
sw2232A-ms98-a-0059 260.363500 265.972500 he unified the Chinese language it was impossible for missionaries to do accomplish anything in China
sw2232A-ms98-a-0060 265.972500 271.421750 because of all that and so even in North and South Vietnam i bet you'd see the same thing
sw2232A-ms98-a-0061 271.421750 281.955750 and that now he build roads so then he'd open and then he dropped dead twenty five years premature he just dropped dead and so something good did come out of that in that
sw2232A-ms98-a-0062 281.955750 285.448375 now you see what i mean it's like now
sw2232A-ms98-a-0063 285.448375 290.282625 [silence]
sw2232A-ms98-a-0064 290.282625 291.528000 uh-huh

sw2232A-ms98-a-0066 296.404750 304.179750 well bless your enemies if your enemy is hungry feed him if he if he needs your asks for your shirt give him your coat also
sw2232A-ms98-a-0067 304.179750 309.583500 so if the the the the South Vietnamese they asked us to help them right
sw2232A-ms98-a-0068 309.583500 311.108125 is that right

sw2232A-ms98-a-0090 406.788625 415.218750 yeah but then again yeah i'd say it is wrong to invade Kuwait and i'm not saying President Bush made the wrong decision i think i'm lacking in my
sw2232A-ms98-a-0091 415.218750 420.745250 i don't think i can come to a complete conclusion on how i feel about the Vietnam War because i'm going to interpret that
sw2232A-ms98-a-0092 420.745250 426.089625 through the Bible and i've kind of always i have been a Christian five years and i've kind of avoided that
sw2232A-ms98-a-0093 426.089625 429.825000 that those the war things and how God approaches that
sw2232A-ms98-a-0094 429.825000 435.911250 because i think its just now coming up to where i really feel like i need to come you know need to decide what i feel
sw2232A-ms98-a-0095 435.911250 446.140625 [silence]
sw2232A-ms98-a-0096 446.140625 447.152250 right
sw2232A-ms98-a-0097 447.152250 448.867750 [silence]
sw2232A-ms98-a-0098 448.867750 453.596750 right they left a woman and a child or the cat the sheep yeah
sw2232A-ms98-a-0099 453.596750 457.920000 [silence]
sw2232A-ms98-a-0100 457.920000 459.568375 i know
sw2232A-ms98-a-0101 459.568375 470.791500 but then again though Jesus the grace pushes you beyond the law you know what i'm saying like so he didn't just say don't kill your don't kill your enemies but don't only don't kill them_1 bless them_1 you know
sw2232A-ms98-a-0102 470.791500 475.513125 and so therefore when we have an enemy come against us i really feel like
sw2232A-ms98-a-0103 475.513125 483.905750 but i really feel like i know i do feel this strongly that when if we had someone come and attack us the best way to handle it
sw2232A-ms98-a-0104 483.905750 490.762750 would be to bless them and humbly go to their other king or the other ruler and say what have we done to offend you
sw2232A-ms98-a-0105 490.762750 493.721375 what can we do to rectify this situation
sw2232A-ms98-a-0106 493.721375 500.087375 and that God would move in that sovereignly and he would get the glory though no king no Bush wouldn't
sw2232A-ms98-a-0107 500.087375 507.619125 because it wouldn't make any sense you know what i'm saying it'd look absolutely ridiculously stupid but it would work out because
sw2232A-ms98-a-0108 507.619125 511.319250 if you follow the scriptural principals it's going to work out because_1 those are that's
sw2232A-ms98-a-0109 511.319250 522.113875 the best way to do it you know but the thing is is that then God gets the glory not a president not a king and i think that's a problem for a lot of politicians is they want the glory
sw2232A-ms98-a-0110 522.113875 525.815875 [silence]
sw2232A-ms98-a-0111 525.815875 527.558500 um-hum
sw2232A-ms98-a-0112 527.558500 531.276625 no well i believe personally i ho[pe]- i [laughter]
sw2232A-ms98-a-0113 531.276625 541.769750 this is where everyone always says my husband always goes through that i go yeah for one if someone broke in my house i would pray that i would have this faith to to to take authority over that
sw2232A-ms98-a-0114 541.769750 547.099625 and i know people that have done that i mean i know that there have been people who have had people break in their homes
sw2232A-ms98-a-0115 547.099625 555.094750 and just say i bind you in Jesus name your [vocalized-noise] i just and rebuke any enemy because i believe it's a spiritual war that's going on
sw2232A-ms98-a-0116 555.094750 560.009875 and it's not normal for someone to come into someone elses home illegally that's not normal
sw2232A-ms98-a-0117 560.009875 565.793625 there's something going on there and that i would have discernment by the Holy Spirit to be able to pray over that
sw2232A-ms98-a-0118 565.793625 572.885375 do you see what i mean and then the same in Vietnam you would you wouldn't handle Vietnam the same way you would handle uh Saddam Hussein
sw2232A-ms98-a-0119 572.885375 578.550375 but i just i have a problem with all the killing but i'm not a new ager i don't believe
sw2232A-ms98-a-0120 578.550375 585.772250 means that i am not for one world government i'm not for all these new age things i- [vocalized-noise] i don't have a problem with uh
sw2232A-ms98-a-0121 585.772250 591.174375 national identity and i'm an American and having different nations and all of this
sw2232A-ms98-a-0122 591.174375 599.022000 but i am concerned about the killing that went on there because i just feel like God has a better way to handle it than that and
