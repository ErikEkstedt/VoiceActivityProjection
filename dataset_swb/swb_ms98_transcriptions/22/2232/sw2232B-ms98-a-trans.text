sw2232B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.812500 [noise]
sw2232B-ms98-a-0002 0.812500 2.517625 [silence]
sw2232B-ms98-a-0003 2.517625 10.055625 well let me preface it i'm a i was a staff officer in Vietnam in sixty nine and seventy
sw2232B-ms98-a-0004 10.055625 14.032375 and i'm in active reserve now so
sw2232B-ms98-a-0005 14.032375 17.670000 uh i'm probably not going to have the opinion you think i would have
sw2232B-ms98-a-0006 17.670000 19.353500 um
sw2232B-ms98-a-0007 19.353500 22.332250 it's it was an interesting
sw2232B-ms98-a-0008 22.332250 32.489250 in that i think that he gave the American people some uh uh a sense of the fact that that uh wars are really run by politicians
sw2232B-ms98-a-0009 32.489250 36.989375 uh i are you old enough to remember the war
sw2232B-ms98-a-0010 36.989375 45.920250 [silence]
sw2232B-ms98-a-0011 45.920250 47.981875 yeah uh
sw2232B-ms98-a-0012 47.981875 49.434250 [silence]
sw2232B-ms98-a-0013 49.434250 53.709625 well December seventy two was when uh we bombed North Vietnam and
sw2232B-ms98-a-0014 53.709625 57.552000 and they released the prisoners in early seventy three so that that time frame
sw2232B-ms98-a-0015 57.552000 62.884500 [silence]
sw2232B-ms98-a-0016 62.884500 69.802125 i think the the significant thing is is today did did you uh did you see Barbara Walters interview with Schwartzkopf
sw2232B-ms98-a-0017 69.802125 71.487375 well they
sw2232B-ms98-a-0018 71.487375 78.174125 [silence]
sw2232B-ms98-a-0019 78.174125 79.217375 well
sw2232B-ms98-a-0020 79.217375 81.332750 what what's your perspective on it
sw2232B-ms98-a-0021 81.332750 124.805750 [silence]
sw2232B-ms98-a-0022 124.805750 125.860875 yes
sw2232B-ms98-a-0023 125.860875 131.294750 [silence]
sw2232B-ms98-a-0024 131.294750 137.096125 well well the difficulty i have is that uh are we our neighbor's keepers
sw2232B-ms98-a-0025 137.096125 147.489000 and this is what i find particularly difficult in that uh if we see injustice and whether it's in a uh you know Chicago or
sw2232B-ms98-a-0026 147.489000 161.425875 uh or or Dallas i- i think if we see it you know we see John Wiley W[iley]- Price hollering injustice i think that's wrong now the question is is was there injustice in Vietnam or was there injustice in Iraq and Kuwait
sw2232B-ms98-a-0027 161.425875 168.296625 the difficult i point is is to where do we step in and and i think that we
sw2232B-ms98-a-0028 168.296625 175.582250 that's that's the part i have difficulty and the the other part is that the the when when your when your 
sw2232B-ms98-a-0029 175.582250 177.978500 when you're looking at Vietnam and you say well
sw2232B-ms98-a-0030 177.978500 180.321000 is fifty eight thousand lives worth it
sw2232B-ms98-a-0031 180.321000 183.929250 and i don't know that anything is worth fifty eight thousand lives
sw2232B-ms98-a-0032 183.929250 214.498500 [silence]
sw2232B-ms98-a-0033 214.498500 224.712250 well the other issue is is is how do you allow uh how how do you allow injustice just like the the policeman in in Los Angeles
sw2232B-ms98-a-0034 224.712250 228.367250 how could how could could you stand there and watch them beat that guy
sw2232B-ms98-a-0035 228.367250 231.194875 if your brother or your sister were being beaten
sw2232B-ms98-a-0036 231.194875 234.578625 by the authorities do we step in well
sw2232B-ms98-a-0037 234.578625 238.018750 in some cases we would and i- i think that's what makes it so difficult
sw2232B-ms98-a-0038 238.018750 265.810875 [silence]
sw2232B-ms98-a-0039 265.810875 266.932750 but
sw2232B-ms98-a-0040 266.932750 284.378250 [silence]
sw2232B-ms98-a-0041 284.378250 290.736500 yeah but but the other the other difficulty is is that it's just if if you take the admonition to to feed my sheep
sw2232B-ms98-a-0042 290.736500 293.273000 and the question is who are my sheep
sw2232B-ms98-a-0043 293.273000 296.621500 and the idea do we go out and feed these people when they're hungry
sw2232B-ms98-a-0044 296.621500 304.492500 [silence]
sw2232B-ms98-a-0045 304.492500 305.957625 but
sw2232B-ms98-a-0046 305.957625 310.758375 [silence]
sw2232B-ms98-a-0047 310.758375 313.827000 yes uh they did the
sw2232B-ms98-a-0048 313.827000 326.989000 i think the the biggest difficulty is is that when your at an agrarian economy like South Vietnam was that in reality uh the the poor farmer poor rice farmer was going to pay taxes
sw2232B-ms98-a-0049 326.989000 329.638125 and the question is who was he going to pay it to
sw2232B-ms98-a-0050 329.638125 335.089750 uh the Communists or the uh alleged Democrats uh democratic form of government and i
sw2232B-ms98-a-0051 335.089750 348.531125 i think that's i think i think uh that's a little was a difficult part there and and i we didn't understand the culture we couldn't uh we had uh we had a a young lady that was fourteen that worked in our
sw2232B-ms98-a-0052 348.531125 360.348750 in the unit i was commander of that appeared to be eight or nine years old and and the people looked like children i mean you couldn't imagine that one would would would conceal a bomb and
sw2232B-ms98-a-0053 360.348750 369.198375 and and do these kind of things i think culturally it really destroyed a lot of the people that that went over and saw these people you just couldn't believe that they would
sw2232B-ms98-a-0054 369.198375 376.105250 that they would be mean and and and drop bombs and kill people and then we would turn around and and napalm them_1 you know if
sw2232B-ms98-a-0055 376.105250 387.946000 and i think there was a lot of a lot of tearing of emotions and i think that if anything that when Schwartzkopf he was saying the idea that we learned we l[earned]- we learned a lot from Vietnam
sw2232B-ms98-a-0056 387.946000 398.948250 now it was it was it was in general bad but and i don't know the problem is now i'm i'm concerned a little bit that that now that the Gulf War is on that we're going to think it was a good war and it was okay
sw2232B-ms98-a-0057 398.948250 407.679250 to go beat up on people and i think that i think we need to a little more justice at home i'm not sure how we get that [laughter] whether there's a connection there but
sw2232B-ms98-a-0058 407.679250 408.953875 in any event
sw2232B-ms98-a-0059 408.953875 433.967000 [silence]
sw2232B-ms98-a-0060 433.967000 446.084250 well the difficulty is is if you look in the Old Testament and and the numbers of places that uh the Lord went out and just simply struck down and that was part of the problem when they went into the Promised Land
sw2232B-ms98-a-0061 446.084250 450.770625 that they that they uh they didn't destroy everybody and that that's
sw2232B-ms98-a-0062 450.770625 452.431750 and
sw2232B-ms98-a-0063 452.431750 458.209875 and that that you know and you i think that's one of those things when we get to Heaven we're going to ask God [laughter]
sw2232B-ms98-a-0064 458.209875 459.901375 [laughter-why] [laughter-did] [laughter-you] [laughter-do] [laughter-it] [laughter-that] [laughter-way]
sw2232B-ms98-a-0065 459.901375 496.447875 [silence]
sw2232B-ms98-a-0066 496.447875 497.675750 what do you
sw2232B-ms98-a-0067 497.675750 502.001875 [silence]
sw2232B-ms98-a-0068 502.001875 503.435375 yeah
sw2232B-ms98-a-0069 503.435375 521.348250 [silence]
sw2232B-ms98-a-0070 521.348250 526.137000 well and i- i and even at the even at the local level when somebody's assaulted
sw2232B-ms98-a-0071 526.137000 528.028125 what do you do turn the other cheek
sw2232B-ms98-a-0072 528.028125 565.982125 [silence]
sw2232B-ms98-a-0073 565.982125 567.854000 yeah
sw2232B-ms98-a-0074 567.854000 599.022000 [silence]
