sw2205B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 15.699500 [silence]
sw2205B-ms98-a-0002 15.699500 18.481250 well do you have time to read the paper in the morning
sw2205B-ms98-a-0003 18.481250 35.285000 [silence]
sw2205B-ms98-a-0004 35.285000 44.497875 you know a lot a lot of people don't take newspapers at all we we took the Morning News for a while and then uh well we've been taking the Times Herald for ages and then
sw2205B-ms98-a-0005 44.497875 48.219125 uh [laughter-dog] [laughter-just] [laughter-ran] [laughter-off] [laughter-with] [laughter-my] [laughter-shoe] [laughter-that's] [laughter-off] [laughter-the] [laughter-subject]
sw2205B-ms98-a-0006 48.219125 57.236125 [laughter-went] [laughter-outside] [laughter-picked] it up and ran off anyway um and then we switched the Morning News but we found we couldn't read enough of it and by the time i got home and had time to
sw2205B-ms98-a-0007 57.236125 63.978875 to read some but but i guess the the issue is uh beside the newspaper do you take any news magazines
sw2205B-ms98-a-0008 63.978875 83.951375 [silence]
sw2205B-ms98-a-0009 83.951375 91.998125 did did you did you hear what Schwartzkopf had to say about uh Pete Arnett and uh the the news coverage
sw2205B-ms98-a-0010 91.998125 103.994250 [silence]
sw2205B-ms98-a-0011 103.994250 113.980750 well any you know Time magazine and even the news that sometimes that that's why i like some diversity the idea that i we have Time which which we we take from time to time
sw2205B-ms98-a-0012 113.980750 120.999875 [laughter] and we the problem is they call up and make this deal you know and well we're taking that and and we also hit the Garland
sw2205B-ms98-a-0013 120.999875 130.807875 Garland Daily News i guess it's it comes out sporadically like twice a week or some[thing]- but i think what's interesting is that if you're that there uh this
sw2205B-ms98-a-0014 130.807875 145.238125 as difficult as he is or as as much as they try they put some bias i had the chance to hear Tracy Rowlett speak to a group and it was interesting that they think that they're basically impartial
sw2205B-ms98-a-0015 145.238125 155.722750 and that but and and you know people accuse them of controlling the news he says you know we don't control the news we just report it the way we the way it is and
sw2205B-ms98-a-0016 155.722750 162.471875 [silence]
sw2205B-ms98-a-0017 162.471875 164.043250 yes
sw2205B-ms98-a-0018 164.043250 176.242250 [silence]
sw2205B-ms98-a-0019 176.242250 189.683500 [laughter] yes and i- i thought that was particularly interesting in the the Gulf War that there were pieces of information that that were apparently uh leaked just as a as as uh a
sw2205B-ms98-a-0020 189.683500 196.049250 a ploy which was um i- i find that fascinating that uh
sw2205B-ms98-a-0021 196.049250 197.492375 [silence]
sw2205B-ms98-a-0022 197.492375 207.301625 i listen to KRLD and uh KLIF the news talk radio and i actually listen to CNN radio do you know it was on radio now
sw2205B-ms98-a-0023 207.301625 211.483750 [vocalized-noise] it's on eleven ninety
sw2205B-ms98-a-0024 211.483750 213.991000 [noise]
sw2205B-ms98-a-0025 213.991000 218.478500 [silence]
sw2205B-ms98-a-0026 218.478500 220.989625 well when i go to work i listen
sw2205B-ms98-a-0027 220.989625 229.480625 [silence]
sw2205B-ms98-a-0028 229.480625 230.696500 yeah
sw2205B-ms98-a-0029 230.696500 235.973750 [silence]
sw2205B-ms98-a-0030 235.973750 247.614500 well with with your you know if you're around the home though and and and can watch TV and read the paper the problem is is that about twenty minutes of news radio or thirty minutes is and then they start repeating everything
sw2205B-ms98-a-0031 247.614500 260.063625 and and so it's kind of a oh that's what's interesting is the CNN uh i don't think i'm trying to think if it's much local i listen to a little of that and i listen to a little of ninety point one i i'm i'm inveterate switcher
sw2205B-ms98-a-0032 260.063625 265.217875 that ninety eight point [laughter-seven] [laughter-i'm] [laughter-i'm] eclectic approach
sw2205B-ms98-a-0033 265.217875 266.979500 [silence]
sw2205B-ms98-a-0034 266.979500 279.189250 well i watch channel five but that has to be that's another bias that has to do with the weather reporting i'm not sure that actually i think channel eight is probably but i know Dave Fox he goes to our church so
sw2205B-ms98-a-0035 279.189250 284.780000 [silence]
sw2205B-ms98-a-0036 284.780000 299.497125 well the channel eight when they came here thirteen fourteen years ago Dave Fox and Tracy Rowlett came together uh from Oklahoma City and apparently channel eight was way down and now they have turned it all around and done a pretty remarkable job and then
sw2205B-ms98-a-0037 299.497125 311.422125 they've been some people move around and uh John Chriswell is anyway the i- i don't know do you do you do you seem to can you tell much difference between the local radio TV stations
sw2205B-ms98-a-0038 311.422125 334.933125 [silence]
sw2205B-ms98-a-0039 334.933125 344.429875 [vocalized-noise] i think that adds to the diversity i think that uh i like that uh there i know you know John Wylie Price i don't know if you kept up but he's been protesting that
sw2205B-ms98-a-0040 344.429875 350.213125 [silence]
sw2205B-ms98-a-0041 350.213125 359.438875 yeah and i think he has legitimate argument i mean you can uh i- i- i grew up in Alabama and so i- i have some prejudices
sw2205B-ms98-a-0042 359.438875 368.590500 but i think that i think that that from a a justice standpoint because we have the option of not watching that station uh i'm not sure i i'm
sw2205B-ms98-a-0043 368.590500 377.999750 totally in favor of affirmative action in some of the programs but i think that uh in some cases the[re]- there should be some real opportunity and and some diversity and
sw2205B-ms98-a-0044 377.999750 390.350500 and this kind of thing and i think that Dallas it turns out though from what i understand has quite good i occasionally go to Saint Louis and uh there for a few days and watch the news and and i think Dallas really does have
sw2205B-ms98-a-0045 390.350500 401.702375 have quite good news i think channel eight is the number one uh ABC affiliate in the US i think Tracy Rowlett was saying that he course he pumping his own
sw2205B-ms98-a-0046 401.702375 406.714375 [silence]
sw2205B-ms98-a-0047 406.714375 408.724500 where'd you move from
sw2205B-ms98-a-0048 408.724500 419.978125 [silence]
sw2205B-ms98-a-0049 419.978125 422.244375 [vocalized-noise] yeah
sw2205B-ms98-a-0050 422.244375 435.606125 it is interesting though it becomes a little of personality in fact the the guy that was on the weatherman on channel eight worked for me oh long time ago twenty years or so even longer than that twenty one twenty three years ago or so
sw2205B-ms98-a-0051 435.606125 441.191500 twenty four anyway long time ago and and shortly after i got we got here fourteen years ago
sw2205B-ms98-a-0052 441.191500 454.043375 and uh they had they had fired him uh because he was too [vocalized-noise] anyway didn't he didn't have the personality and wasn't drawing the crowds and that's interesting is that's that's what the TV stations do they're trying to get ratings
sw2205B-ms98-a-0053 454.043375 457.991250 and i think if we remember that that they're out after the ratings
sw2205B-ms98-a-0054 457.991250 471.467500 and some well it's like the the Dale Hansen on channel eight li[ttle]- is a sometimes a little too cutesy but i wonder if we're coming up on ten minutes have you talked have you been on the conversation when they beeped you at ten minutes
sw2205B-ms98-a-0055 471.467500 474.981500 [silence]
sw2205B-ms98-a-0056 474.981500 478.491500 [laughter-okay] well good talking to you good night
sw2205B-ms98-a-0057 478.491500 482.133500 [noise]
