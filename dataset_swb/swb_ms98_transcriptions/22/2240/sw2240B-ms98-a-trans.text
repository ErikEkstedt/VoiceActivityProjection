sw2240B-ms98-a-0003 11.432750 21.722750 w[ell]- well of course uh it depends i guess on what you're uh oh oh what you're you're interest and abilities are so far as whether you're going to paint yourself uh
sw2240B-ms98-a-0004 21.722750 31.206375 i've painted uh like i said both interior and exterior myself uh not a lot of exterior but uh i've painted you know rooms and ceilings inside and
sw2240B-ms98-a-0005 31.206375 37.806250 you know and i usually find it uh pretty easy and and it's cheaper than hiring somebody else to do it
sw2240B-ms98-a-0006 37.806250 40.721875 it's um yeah yeah it
sw2240B-ms98-a-0007 40.721875 42.806500 [silence]
sw2240B-ms98-a-0008 42.806500 54.379750 well i- i nearly always use a latex base uh especially for interior uh the brands uh you know vary but uh Sherwin Williams makes a pretty good paint and Jones Blair and
sw2240B-ms98-a-0009 54.379750 57.738500 you know Kelley i think makes pretty good paint so

sw2240B-ms98-a-0041 164.958250 175.490250 yeah that's uh i- i did a had to paint the uh my brick my house is brick on the outside except for the overhangs and you know like a a little bit of uh
sw2240B-ms98-a-0042 175.490250 179.568250 what do you call the the eaves and stuff and uh
sw2240B-ms98-a-0043 179.568250 181.404750 [silence]
sw2240B-ms98-a-0044 181.404750 183.045875 yeah yeah
sw2240B-ms98-a-0045 183.045875 189.761625 but uh those overhangs and things do have to be painted you know every four or five years and i bought a uh a power roller
sw2240B-ms98-a-0046 189.761625 200.262250 that uh it's really designed for indoor use but it's got an uh you know an extension and a pump you just put your can of paint down in the in this pump and it pumps the paint up through the roller
sw2240B-ms98-a-0047 200.262250 203.030125 and and it works pretty good
sw2240B-ms98-a-0048 203.030125 211.379375 well it's got a uh got a regulator on it that you just set the set the deal on it you know for the the flow and then it's got a trigger on it
sw2240B-ms98-a-0049 211.379375 216.860000 that you can release to let the pressure pump the paint up into this handle
sw2240B-ms98-a-0050 216.860000 218.170750 [silence]
sw2240B-ms98-a-0051 218.170750 222.185000 yeah it's an electr[ic]- just a little electric pump motor that uh
sw2240B-ms98-a-0052 222.185000 226.380500 turns on and off you know builds up pressure so that it you know it kind of
sw2240B-ms98-a-0053 226.380500 230.026250 pushes the paint up this uh up the extension
sw2240B-ms98-a-0054 230.026250 239.864500 it's a uh Black and Decker brand and and it works pretty good like i said it was designed for indoor use you know for painting walls and ceilings but i found it worked pretty good for outdoors uh
sw2240B-ms98-a-0055 239.864500 246.314125 there's certain times of the year of course that uh that it probably wouldn't do very well because of the temperature and stuff but
sw2240B-ms98-a-0056 246.314125 248.919875 but uh the right time of year it works pretty good
sw2240B-ms98-a-0057 248.919875 254.561500 [silence]
sw2240B-ms98-a-0058 254.561500 266.362250 well if if you buy a good grade of paint uh you don't really uh of course Texas heat you know you it really gets pretty hot outside so you have to be sure and get a good grade of paint
sw2240B-ms98-a-0059 266.362250 267.722625 [silence]
sw2240B-ms98-a-0060 267.722625 269.798375 for the direct sunlight and stuff
sw2240B-ms98-a-0061 269.798375 271.874000 right but uh
sw2240B-ms98-a-0062 271.874000 281.627625 but i- i haven't really found it too bad we've lived in our house about uh oh thirteen years i suppose and and r[eally]- really only painted once and you know it was new when we bought it
sw2240B-ms98-a-0063 281.627625 286.412250 and we painted one time since then but you know it's probably going to be time to paint again
sw2240B-ms98-a-0064 286.412250 287.745000 in a couple of years

sw2240B-ms98-a-0068 294.276125 304.148750 on the on the interior do you do uh do y'all have a lot of uh plaster walls that the the uh color is built into the plaster so you don't paint a lot
sw2240B-ms98-a-0069 304.148750 305.796625 oh
sw2240B-ms98-a-0070 305.796625 310.442000 yeah i- i watch uh some of these TV programs you know how to do it's you know you fix it
sw2240B-ms98-a-0071 310.442000 311.917125 you fix it so
sw2240B-ms98-a-0072 311.917125 319.820000 yeah This Old House and some of those and i- i really haven't you know haven't paid a lot of attention to to whether or not you do painting on on top of plaster or not so
sw2240B-ms98-a-0073 319.820000 321.087625 [silence]
sw2240B-ms98-a-0074 321.087625 323.111500 so i hadn't hadn't really thought about that

sw2240B-ms98-a-0076 325.965250 338.913500 well that's what my impression was that they you know that they were just white well they're white walls you know unless it's white if you want white walls then white plaster is uh doesn't need to be painted or that was my impression anyway i'm not sure
sw2240B-ms98-a-0077 338.913500 340.485500 [silence]

sw2240B-ms98-a-0091 367.238750 376.401500 we've got paper on uh our dining room and kitchen and bathrooms and then we've got paneling in our family room and game room
sw2240B-ms98-a-0092 376.401500 378.303500 so

sw2240B-ms98-a-0094 379.382250 384.552125 but we don't have a lot of paint inside of course the ceilings are you know all all have to be painted
sw2240B-ms98-a-0095 384.552125 394.076125 but uh but they don't require a lot if the only the problem that i've seen in the past is like when you've got uh if you've got natural gas and heat of course you don't
sw2240B-ms98-a-0096 394.076125 400.776625 in the east i suppose you don't have a lot of natural gas heat but if you don't have your your heat adjusted your gas adjusted right
sw2240B-ms98-a-0097 400.776625 406.621375 then you can get some stains you know on the ceilings and you know cei[ling]- cei[ling]-

sw2240B-ms98-a-0124 466.868125 477.080000 so well we did do that we we stripped the paint off or the paper off of one of our you know off of our part of our house and then repapered it and it's that was not any fun
sw2240B-ms98-a-0125 477.080000 482.182750 but uh we stripped and then had somebody else come in and do the actually put the paper up
sw2240B-ms98-a-0126 482.182750 485.900000 next time i think i'll do it the other way around let them strip and i'll hang the paper
