sw2240A-ms98-a-0003 5.975625 11.599500 do you have any uh any thoughts on whether painting's a good idea or a bad idea
sw2240A-ms98-a-0004 11.599500 13.602875 [silence]
sw2240A-ms98-a-0005 13.602875 14.898375 [noise]
sw2240A-ms98-a-0006 14.898375 37.523125 [silence]
sw2240A-ms98-a-0007 37.523125 43.041000 oh that's yeah that's for sure um what kind of paint do you like to use
sw2240A-ms98-a-0008 43.041000 55.176000 [silence]
sw2240A-ms98-a-0009 55.176000 56.981625 yeah
sw2240A-ms98-a-0010 56.981625 64.431750 then you don't have you don't have that mess to clean up when you use an oil oil base painting and boy i'll tell you oh
sw2240A-ms98-a-0011 64.431750 67.295875 um we uh
sw2240A-ms98-a-0012 67.295875 70.773750 i designed and built my own home about_1 twelve years ago
sw2240A-ms98-a-0013 70.773750 74.890875 and it was one of the uh you know the old New England saltbox
sw2240A-ms98-a-0014 74.890875 81.009625 so instead of painting because i figured when i got uh just a couple years older i'm not going to want to climb up on a ladder
sw2240A-ms98-a-0015 81.009625 82.025000 [silence]
sw2240A-ms98-a-0016 82.025000 84.337875 so we put uh
sw2240A-ms98-a-0017 84.337875 88.447250 white cedar shingles on the house and let it weather naturally
sw2240A-ms98-a-0018 88.447250 92.063000 and the trim instead of painting i stained
sw2240A-ms98-a-0019 92.063000 98.582750 so i figured instead of going out there and scraping and you know having a having to climb up on a ladder
sw2240A-ms98-a-0020 98.582750 103.316500 the stain kind of just uh it weathers
sw2240A-ms98-a-0021 103.316500 106.681250 so i eliminated that
sw2240A-ms98-a-0022 106.681250 110.682375 chore that i don't have to do that i stained
sw2240A-ms98-a-0023 110.682375 116.530500 the original stain and i stained once since then because it started fading a little bit
sw2240A-ms98-a-0024 116.530500 118.111625 but other than that
sw2240A-ms98-a-0025 118.111625 125.638750 um i'm like you i like to use a latex paint on the inside we've uh we've done some uh walls
sw2240A-ms98-a-0026 125.638750 131.731125 the ones we haven't papered we've done in uh uh latex uh uh pastels
sw2240A-ms98-a-0027 131.731125 140.392125 and clean up is is uh is a joy uh a little soap and water and air dry them_1 and you don't have to worry about that
sw2240A-ms98-a-0028 140.392125 143.256000 [noise]
sw2240A-ms98-a-0029 143.256000 146.011375 [silence]
sw2240A-ms98-a-0030 146.011375 152.312750 yeah a roller and uh i bought one of those that you can screw in uh uh a three foot extension
sw2240A-ms98-a-0031 152.312750 158.669250 so you can climb up on the walls and the ceilings we didn't paint the ceilings was just natural plaster
sw2240A-ms98-a-0032 158.669250 163.570250 so i didn't want to get into doing anything there it's just uh
sw2240A-ms98-a-0033 163.570250 166.895875 so far it's okay you know we haven't had any problems with it
sw2240A-ms98-a-0034 166.895875 177.820000 [silence]
sw2240A-ms98-a-0035 177.820000 183.454625 yeah so you're lucky too you don't have to worry about going out there and scraping and painting and
sw2240A-ms98-a-0036 183.454625 199.870625 [silence]
sw2240A-ms98-a-0037 199.870625 203.491375 how do you control the amount of flow or anything
sw2240A-ms98-a-0038 203.491375 216.740875 [silence]

sw2240A-ms98-a-0044 238.203375 248.385625 [silence]
sw2240A-ms98-a-0045 248.385625 251.882750 you really have a problem down there with with
sw2240A-ms98-a-0046 251.882750 256.335000 having to repaint with with paint blistering or peeling off or
sw2240A-ms98-a-0047 256.335000 266.172000 [silence]
sw2240A-ms98-a-0048 266.172000 271.744875 oh that's there for direct yeah the direct sun beating on it yeah yeah that's right
sw2240A-ms98-a-0049 271.744875 286.452375 [silence]
sw2240A-ms98-a-0050 286.452375 294.889125 so you're in the same position that i'm in i've i've only done mine twice and you've you've done yours twice too well once was on there and then you just had to do it once
sw2240A-ms98-a-0051 294.889125 303.584500 [silence]
sw2240A-ms98-a-0052 303.584500 305.645875 no no
sw2240A-ms98-a-0053 305.645875 310.163000 [silence]
sw2240A-ms98-a-0054 310.163000 312.506875 oh like This Old House

sw2240A-ms98-a-0056 320.315625 321.589125 hum
sw2240A-ms98-a-0057 321.589125 326.496000 so they just when they when they put the plaster walls up they just tinted the plaster
sw2240A-ms98-a-0058 326.496000 339.645625 [silence]
sw2240A-ms98-a-0059 339.645625 345.871250 hum yeah that's interesting no ours you know wouldn't they were just regular plaster walls
sw2240A-ms98-a-0060 345.871250 351.469125 and then some of them_1 you know like the kitchen and the bathrooms we uh we had put paper up
sw2240A-ms98-a-0061 351.469125 361.151625 and actually the uh bedrooms upstairs too but but the rest of it and i- i just don't like papering i painting is is a lot easier
sw2240A-ms98-a-0062 361.151625 376.256875 [silence]
sw2240A-ms98-a-0063 376.256875 380.319875 all right so you don't have a a lot of paint either
sw2240A-ms98-a-0064 380.319875 381.611625 uh-huh
sw2240A-ms98-a-0065 381.611625 384.501375 [silence]
sw2240A-ms98-a-0066 384.501375 386.025750 yeah
sw2240A-ms98-a-0067 386.025750 402.444250 [silence]
sw2240A-ms98-a-0068 402.444250 410.016125 oh they get yeah yeah and that's something we don't we get uh we've got on oil fired hot water baseboard
sw2240A-ms98-a-0069 410.016125 415.857375 so and it doesn't generate uh there's a little dust on it once in a while but it's not even like hot air
sw2240A-ms98-a-0070 415.857375 421.361000 so and we don't use gas in fact there wasn't any gas in the in the street when we built there was no houses around
sw2240A-ms98-a-0071 421.361000 422.381875 [silence]
sw2240A-ms98-a-0072 422.381875 425.291125 um so we didn't have that problem um
sw2240A-ms98-a-0073 425.291125 427.230500 i've got a wood stove
sw2240A-ms98-a-0074 427.230500 433.156625 and i thought for a while that that may create a problem but it hasn't it's wood it's uh
sw2240A-ms98-a-0075 433.156625 439.310125 air tight yeah so that even that doesn't doesn't create a problem but i think uh
sw2240A-ms98-a-0076 439.310125 440.380250 [silence]
sw2240A-ms98-a-0077 440.380250 448.186500 more and more people are getting away from paint they're they're doing other things um especially with the oil base
sw2240A-ms98-a-0078 448.186500 451.038125 [silence]
sw2240A-ms98-a-0079 451.038125 452.749375 yep yep
sw2240A-ms98-a-0080 452.749375 455.235750 and there's there's less maintenance
sw2240A-ms98-a-0081 455.235750 457.591250 yeah you don't have to
sw2240A-ms98-a-0082 457.591250 464.278250 [silence]
sw2240A-ms98-a-0083 464.278250 466.798250 [laughter]

sw2240A-ms98-a-0092 507.203250 508.248625 [silence]

sw2240A-ms98-a-0097 525.364000 537.776500 so what are the other questions that i'm actually i had a house um my home before this one was uh was a Cape Ann and i wasn't up and down too that was uh that was kind of high and that was painted um
sw2240A-ms98-a-0098 537.776500 544.082500 we bought that and it was uh the paint was uh so-so i had s[craped]- i had to do a lot of scraping
sw2240A-ms98-a-0099 544.082500 546.369875 and then i put uh
sw2240A-ms98-a-0100 546.369875 550.371625 uh water base paint over
sw2240A-ms98-a-0101 550.371625 552.413125 the uh oil
sw2240A-ms98-a-0102 552.413125 555.251000 and it was eight years before i had to do it again
sw2240A-ms98-a-0103 555.251000 558.061875 and uh and the manufacturer
sw2240A-ms98-a-0104 558.061875 564.471625 recommended that uh he gave me uh i can't remember what the solution was and he said just uh wash your house down with it
sw2240A-ms98-a-0105 564.471625 565.571375 [silence]
sw2240A-ms98-a-0106 565.571375 572.359875 and then uh you know with a long brush and then just hose it all down and i had the whole yard was full of soap suds
sw2240A-ms98-a-0107 572.359875 578.975375 and he said just paint over that and we sold the house oh well twelve years ago
sw2240A-ms98-a-0108 578.975375 581.516875 and i don't think they've repainted since
sw2240A-ms98-a-0109 581.516875 583.040000 so that's held up
sw2240A-ms98-a-0110 583.040000 585.405500 [silence]
sw2240A-ms98-a-0111 585.405500 592.914625 and it was right i had uh i had put one coat of of uh
sw2240A-ms98-a-0112 592.914625 598.299000 water base and then before we sold it there was another one and i'd wash the house down and all that
sw2240A-ms98-a-0113 598.299000 599.872875 and it's it's held up
