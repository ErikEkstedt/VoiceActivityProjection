sw2253B-ms98-a-0021 104.860250 107.367500 i think this is like two years ago
sw2253B-ms98-a-0022 107.367500 120.080625 and somebody had given me one of these dinky do crappy women's novels set in the Civil War John Jakes one and the novel didn't do that much for me but boy the period of time was fascinating 
sw2253B-ms98-a-0023 120.080625 122.363250 so i then read
sw2253B-ms98-a-0024 122.363250 124.896375 was it Battle Cry of Freedom
sw2253B-ms98-a-0025 124.896375 129.875250 yeah i think it was Battle Cry of Freedom it's kind of like a historical compendium
sw2253B-ms98-a-0026 129.875250 142.141500 of the Civil War and it's not a story of the Civil War it's a story of all the politics and uh lobbying and just basically state by state events that led
sw2253B-ms98-a-0027 142.141500 152.429625 to of the events that brought about the Civil War and it's fascinating because i had always you know have been raised on this you know [Emancimation/Emancipation] Proclamation with the Civil War
sw2253B-ms98-a-0028 152.429625 160.950750 [vocalized-noise] there was a lot more to it than that as a matter of fact that was a very minor part that kind of become like an afterthought
sw2253B-ms98-a-0029 160.950750 161.936375 [silence]

sw2253B-ms98-a-0036 213.658375 222.182875 i kept waiting for where's some reference to this God damn State of Texas and the role that they played either leading up to or in the Civil War they might as well have not even
sw2253B-ms98-a-0037 222.182875 234.485500 been there you know they weren't a state and the only the only way that they had any part in it was after worth as to you know who's going to be going there and i keep telling my husband that and he keeps saying oh no i thought okay

sw2253B-ms98-a-0060 346.089125 348.372875 i think this is because the kids are getting to me
sw2253B-ms98-a-0061 348.372875 350.432125 is science fiction
sw2253B-ms98-a-0062 350.432125 354.693375 [silence]

sw2253B-ms98-a-0064 360.113750 362.662875 and i i'm trying to think of
sw2253B-ms98-a-0065 362.662875 366.160000 oh Isaac Asimov Robot series
sw2253B-ms98-a-0066 366.160000 375.284500 i mean i think i've read all four of them and i understand that there's a fifth in the last [laughter-six] [laughter-weeks] he's been on the road a lot

sw2253B-ms98-a-0068 395.613000 408.495125 you know i think i read Hawaii when i was about ten years old or so which is about the developmental level that you know you need to be at to read those things and i still even then i was so so disgusted with it i- i tried to read
sw2253B-ms98-a-0069 408.495125 413.613500 i don't remember which other one it was whatever one it was it was such a blockbuster seller
sw2253B-ms98-a-0070 413.613500 419.829125 and i just i got about like a hundred pages through it and realized i had like a thousand more i thought i can't do this
sw2253B-ms98-a-0071 419.829125 423.311625 [silence]
sw2253B-ms98-a-0072 423.311625 424.758000 yeah

sw2253B-ms98-a-0083 451.892625 453.287250 now that's one
sw2253B-ms98-a-0084 453.287250 459.957500 that's one i don't know see i had never really been into science fiction that much until uh
sw2253B-ms98-a-0085 459.957500 466.870375 somebody gave me Mist of Avalon probably about five or six years ago i don't know if i'd call it science fiction or fantasy
sw2253B-ms98-a-0086 466.870375 473.541125 [silence]
sw2253B-ms98-a-0087 473.541125 487.164250 well i loved that novel and then somebody said oh God this would have been even long ago because i was in Boston and it was raining all night and i had a hole in my roof and i was waiting for the whole house to collapse and uh i was reading Dune
sw2253B-ms98-a-0088 487.164250 489.404125 which seeming rather ironic
sw2253B-ms98-a-0089 489.404125 500.260125 and i read the whole damn book while i was home hauling out you know like ten gallon buckets of of water and waiting for the roof to collapse and reading about these guys wearing their little Freeman Steel suits and
sw2253B-ms98-a-0090 500.260125 510.987000 i think that's probably my favorite of of any piece of science fiction that i've ever read and the movie was awful oh yes it was just terrible
sw2253B-ms98-a-0091 510.987000 513.954625 it was it was beyond [vocalized-noise]
sw2253B-ms98-a-0092 513.954625 519.185250 [silence]
sw2253B-ms98-a-0093 519.185250 522.326375 i don't know i just remember Sting was in it
sw2253B-ms98-a-0094 522.326375 526.194750 yeah and if you were trying to follow any type of uh
sw2253B-ms98-a-0095 526.194750 533.276500 plot it it tot[al]- even having read the book and i've read that book probably three times watching that movie i couldn't figure out what they were talking about
sw2253B-ms98-a-0096 533.276500 534.872875 at all
sw2253B-ms98-a-0097 534.872875 540.726250 i was real disappointed in that well i'll tell you another good book do you like scary [noise] things
sw2253B-ms98-a-0098 540.726250 543.055750 [silence]

sw2253B-ms98-a-0102 550.665875 554.358750 [silence]
sw2253B-ms98-a-0103 554.358750 561.990625 well see i'm i'm debating whether or not i [laughter-want] to go see the movie after having read the book i mean the book is is chilling just chilling 
sw2253B-ms98-a-0104 561.990625 563.706500 [silence]
sw2253B-ms98-a-0105 563.706500 565.725500 then i won't tell you
sw2253B-ms98-a-0106 565.725500 570.314000 [laughter] it's just that if you're ever ever really want to just be scared out of your wits
sw2253B-ms98-a-0107 570.314000 571.070000 [silence]
sw2253B-ms98-a-0108 571.070000 572.734375 that's the one yes
sw2253B-ms98-a-0109 572.734375 574.012875 [silence]
sw2253B-ms98-a-0110 574.012875 582.218750 yes because the cha[racter]- the the character that is so horrible is another human being And you're just drawn into his
sw2253B-ms98-a-0111 582.218750 588.777000 [noise] his horror of him that you begin to kind of like him
sw2253B-ms98-a-0112 588.777000 591.181750 that [noise] i mean
sw2253B-ms98-a-0113 591.181750 598.270125 no no This guy's smart and he's suave and he's all the charac[teristics]- all the characteristics yeah all the characteristics
