sw2260A-ms98-a-0058 324.767000 332.553625 yeah yeah you kn[ow]- there's a a thing i just i've been trying to learn as much as i can about it
sw2260A-ms98-a-0059 332.553625 346.570125 i[f]- if you pay i- i know i get paid twice a month uh every two weeks instead of twice a month so i get twenty six paychecks which would come out to be in like thirteen months
sw2260A-ms98-a-0060 346.570125 358.300375 so if you pay your uh rent or your house payment every two weeks instead of once a month you'll come out paying a
sw2260A-ms98-a-0061 358.300375 368.570500 uh one month extra every year and it'll if have you a thirty year note it will take like seven or plus years off of your note
