sw2260B-ms98-a-0004 58.938375 68.265750 well i have to agree that [laughter] and and you're right i mean we you know we do have a good government we do have a lot of things
sw2260B-ms98-a-0005 68.265750 75.997625 that you know show that the taxes are there to support but i do think they're mismanaged and i think that sometimes it's too easy of a
sw2260B-ms98-a-0006 75.997625 88.850375 i don't know to easy of an answer it seems to the politician to say i'll tax them_1 if you can't get enough money instead of trying to figure out how to cut budgets or cut spending or or you know get all of the waste out of the spending
sw2260B-ms98-a-0007 88.850375 94.840250 um i don't know what y'all are paying in Dallas but you know it seems like we pay the state you know there is a
sw2260B-ms98-a-0008 94.840250 106.936750 the taxes is set by you know the the state and the city can add theirs and the county adds theirs and you know we're paying almost eight percent sales tax right now which seems to me nuts i came from California
sw2260B-ms98-a-0009 106.936750 112.175875 and you know when i left there we paid six cents on the dollar and that was like one of the highest in the nation
sw2260B-ms98-a-0010 112.175875 113.481125 [silence]
sw2260B-ms98-a-0011 113.481125 115.493500 yeah

sw2260B-ms98-a-0013 123.553750 130.830375 we don't want a state income tax but yet they allow the sales tax to go up and up and up and up and they don't do anything about it
sw2260B-ms98-a-0014 130.830375 132.272750 so
sw2260B-ms98-a-0015 132.272750 133.334125 [silence]
sw2260B-ms98-a-0016 133.334125 136.961875 [noise] i'm in Lubbock Texas yeah
sw2260B-ms98-a-0017 136.961875 140.391625 [silence]
sw2260B-ms98-a-0018 140.391625 152.443125 that's true and i did pay state tax in in California but my goodness that that the what do you call it sales tax is just getting outrageous to pay
sw2260B-ms98-a-0019 152.443125 157.682875 know you don't sound like you're from Dallas where do you co[me]- do you come from originally Texas or
sw2260B-ms98-a-0020 157.682875 161.475125 [silence]
sw2260B-ms98-a-0021 161.475125 163.461500 oh okay
sw2260B-ms98-a-0022 163.461500 167.994500 [silence]
sw2260B-ms98-a-0023 167.994500 177.465875 you just you just managed to escape the real Texan accent i thought maybe you had come from somewhere else and had some experience with taxes there
sw2260B-ms98-a-0024 177.465875 179.954375 yeah
sw2260B-ms98-a-0025 179.954375 193.443625 [silence]
sw2260B-ms98-a-0026 193.443625 195.541000 that's right
sw2260B-ms98-a-0027 195.541000 204.489125 [silence]
sw2260B-ms98-a-0028 204.489125 206.644875 yeah
sw2260B-ms98-a-0029 206.644875 216.603000 [silence]
sw2260B-ms98-a-0030 216.603000 226.845500 oh were you really trying to find someone at home well you know um back then what they try to do you know the [vocalized-noise] would always try to stump Jesus try to give him something that would make him contradict himself
sw2260B-ms98-a-0031 226.845500 236.033500 and so that's what they were trying to do with the tax situation and of course that's when he said well you know you render unto Caesar's what is Caesar's you render unto God what is God's and uh 
sw2260B-ms98-a-0032 236.033500 242.834750 a[nd]- you know of course there i don't think they really cared about the answer they just wanted to try and catch him in something [laughter]
sw2260B-ms98-a-0033 242.834750 248.081500 but i you know i believe in paying taxes and i mean yeah like everybody else i try to
sw2260B-ms98-a-0034 248.081500 262.481625 you know take as many deductions as i can that right and honest you know i don't want to pay more than i have to and and i get outraged sometimes when i feel like they go up for useless reasons but i believe that they're necessary you know so i really do
sw2260B-ms98-a-0035 262.481625 268.396500 where do do uh do you deal with taxes much in what you do when you work or
sw2260B-ms98-a-0036 268.396500 285.464625 [silence]
sw2260B-ms98-a-0037 285.464625 290.478500 schedule A well yeah and you know
sw2260B-ms98-a-0038 290.478500 299.240750 did you notice that when they passed the new simplified tax act it seemed like it made everything harder [laughter]
sw2260B-ms98-a-0039 299.240750 307.490875 i didn't notice anything simplified about it except that they took away the deductions for the interest and [laughter] other things
sw2260B-ms98-a-0040 307.490875 309.477375 yeah
sw2260B-ms98-a-0041 309.477375 311.496375 [silence]
sw2260B-ms98-a-0042 311.496375 322.784625 and it will help tremendously we bought ours five years ago and it's the one thing it seems like you make those payments every month and at the end of the year you've paid all interest and no principles
sw2260B-ms98-a-0043 322.784625 327.260875 so that will definitely help in taxes and what you will get back
sw2260B-ms98-a-0044 327.260875 336.973625 [silence]
sw2260B-ms98-a-0045 336.973625 338.522000 uh-huh
sw2260B-ms98-a-0046 338.522000 340.768625 uh-huh
sw2260B-ms98-a-0047 340.768625 342.734375 that's right
sw2260B-ms98-a-0048 342.734375 352.696500 [silence]

sw2260B-ms98-a-0052 361.992250 365.956000 [silence]
sw2260B-ms98-a-0053 365.956000 372.875875 that's right my parents uh bought a home in San Diego about four or five years ago
sw2260B-ms98-a-0054 372.875875 384.358125 and they did that they thought their payment is automatically taken out like every other Wednesday and that's exactly right even though the note is thirty years she said it's going be paid off in like twenty or twenty one years or something like that
sw2260B-ms98-a-0055 384.358125 390.693375 uh just because uh exactly what you said you're making one more months payment every year
sw2260B-ms98-a-0056 390.693375 393.218125 [silence]
sw2260B-ms98-a-0057 393.218125 395.766750 yeah so that's
sw2260B-ms98-a-0058 395.766750 410.275875 that's a good way to do it and when we bought this house we looked at doing a fifteen year note because it it added more to the payment but not significant amounts you know it was it was a good payoff for being able to pay it off sooner
sw2260B-ms98-a-0059 410.275875 412.275375 [silence]
sw2260B-ms98-a-0060 412.275375 414.496250 yeah
