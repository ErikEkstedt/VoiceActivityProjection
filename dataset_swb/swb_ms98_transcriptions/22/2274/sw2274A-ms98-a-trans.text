sw2274A-ms98-a-0004 12.091375 19.744375 right exactly and um the the interesting thing is that it seems that they don't even think about it
sw2274A-ms98-a-0005 19.744375 29.646625 it's not anything that seems to be um you know costing everybody a lot of money it's not a major topic of conversation it's just something that's done and accepted
sw2274A-ms98-a-0006 29.646625 30.817875 [silence]
sw2274A-ms98-a-0007 30.817875 39.003000 well um i think the government subsidizes most of it but i- i believe that that again just people are taxed
sw2274A-ms98-a-0008 39.003000 47.736875 a little bit more but it's just interesting how something you know that we consider just such a major issue is just in such working order there

sw2274A-ms98-a-0054 196.342375 205.603625 i know well and well you know you're not the only one though um i'm in a situation where when i started my job they were paying full benefits
sw2274A-ms98-a-0055 205.603625 219.001500 i thought great you know can't get any better and then slowly each year you know now they're down to seventy five percent and then they went down to fifty percent and and i understand they have to do that with the prices going up and up 
sw2274A-ms98-a-0056 219.001500 230.770625 but um you just might as well knock of a couple thousand dollars from your salary you know to pay for this medical care and then i- i don't have kids so i'm not worrying about family coverage
sw2274A-ms98-a-0057 230.770625 234.626250 but once you get into family coverage it's crazy
sw2274A-ms98-a-0058 234.626250 236.899750 i[t]- it's just crazy

sw2274A-ms98-a-0064 263.271500 268.727250 right they have a hundred dollars to spend in December i know what you [laughter-mean]
sw2274A-ms98-a-0065 268.727250 279.060125 yeah we do that too we're fortunate though this year somehow how it's only March and we've already used up our [laughter-entire] amount i don't know if that's good or bad
sw2274A-ms98-a-0066 279.060125 285.485375 [silence]
sw2274A-ms98-a-0067 285.485375 287.736375 i don't know um
sw2274A-ms98-a-0068 287.736375 300.885000 i think it covers a portion because like i said my sister lives over there and they they just they just never have to worry about it i think it might not cover full dental but it does cover some and again it covers you know
sw2274A-ms98-a-0069 300.885000 313.666500 major things it won't cover cosmetic type things you know if you choose to do something but um it's just like all in it's just all in practice it's all in plan i think that we could learn from that
sw2274A-ms98-a-0070 313.666500 319.375000 [silence]
sw2274A-ms98-a-0071 319.375000 329.728000 i don't know i really don't know i know that they do equally as well there as they do here i mean doctors still have that same status
sw2274A-ms98-a-0072 329.728000 340.221500 [noise] i don't know i guess they're getting paid for it one way or another and and i would imagine although i don't know maybe there still are private practices there i don't know
sw2274A-ms98-a-0073 340.221500 345.902250 i don't know but um it would be great and and if only i mean
sw2274A-ms98-a-0074 345.902250 358.043125 health is probably the one thing that people should be most concerned with you know espec[ially]- that makes a good society when people are healthy and they're not you know they're not stealing for money to pay for their doctors' bills
sw2274A-ms98-a-0075 358.043125 366.503250 you know they're they're going to work every day because they're not sick you know i mean just something that should be more of a priority than it is now

sw2274A-ms98-a-0080 378.441625 390.611250 um-hum well at least let them start off gradually you know fine so they won't jump into paying full health care let them pay you know partial and each year just you know let's increase it from there
sw2274A-ms98-a-0081 390.611250 393.455250 i don't know but
