sw2274B-ms98-a-0015 62.896625 68.366875 you know i'm a single parent and you know i have to pay for medical insurance and
sw2274B-ms98-a-0016 68.366875 78.596000 it's just outrageous my son you know has got allergies and he's got this and he's got that and he broke his arm i mean and you know it's a thousand dollars here a thousand dollars there
sw2274B-ms98-a-0017 78.596000 90.521000 and you know even though the insurance is paying eighty percent of it you're pay an arm and a leg for the insurance first of all and then you're still paying yeah the twenty percent and so

sw2274B-ms98-a-0023 109.458625 118.687750 and i don't think that that's fair i don't think it's fair you know to the kids and and to the people that are sick and i know that you know
sw2274B-ms98-a-0024 118.687750 129.695750 every city has you know their you know their free hospitals or whatever and i know a few people that have had experiences in those
sw2274B-ms98-a-0025 129.695750 138.932500 i've been fortunate enough not to but i mean you could go down there half dead and sti[ll]- wait you know it's hard to see a doctor from what i've heard

sw2274B-ms98-a-0029 165.077500 175.522875 you know i'm thinking of you know i just did my tax return for the last year you know if your medical bills are more than a certain percent of your income
sw2274B-ms98-a-0030 175.522875 182.536500 you know it's worthwhile to itemize and and last year i was the first [laughter-year] we reached that mark
sw2274B-ms98-a-0031 182.536500 191.646250 where my medical where it was worth it to itemize for medical expenses because they were just they were that much of a percentage of my income that it just
sw2274B-ms98-a-0032 191.646250 198.602750 you know i just did it it's very frustrating [laughter] a hot topic for me [laughter]

sw2274B-ms98-a-0040 233.407000 245.834125 oh it's out it's outrageous and then a lot of companies you know offer you know you can have a certain amount deducted pre tax from your pay check for medical expenses but not covered by insurance but 
sw2274B-ms98-a-0041 245.834125 255.602500 you know that's something that's something fairly new and not a lot of people take advantage of it but it's you know it's use it or lose it and [laughter-i]
