sw2290B-ms98-a-0090 401.427500 413.712250 the weirdest fishing experience i ever had and uh people to this day are still trying to figure out if i really caught what i think i caught we were in uh Rockport which is close to Corpus
sw2290B-ms98-a-0091 413.712250 419.290250 and we had been fishing in a canal they had all these canals up through this one little retirement area
sw2290B-ms98-a-0092 419.290250 427.690000 and uh we'd been fishing in the canals and all we were catching were catfish and we were pretty bored with that so we thought well maybe there are some crab in here we'll try to catch some crab
sw2290B-ms98-a-0093 427.690000 431.740375 so i got my chicken neck and all my little net and everything
sw2290B-ms98-a-0094 431.740375 435.426625 and something i had a rock to weight it down
sw2290B-ms98-a-0095 435.426625 443.709000 something grabs and just runs with it and of course there's no hook so it can't be a fish i'm i'm sure it's not a fish right
sw2290B-ms98-a-0096 443.709000 455.589000 and crab they don't bite like that they don't just run with your food so i netted it and it was the ugliest fish i've ever seen in my life It had real teeth like human teeth
sw2290B-ms98-a-0097 455.589000 465.295500 and it looked archaic i i had no idea what it was i called my father long distance just to describe the thing and it had the rock in it's mouth
sw2290B-ms98-a-0098 465.295500 478.631750 it not the chicken but the rock itself is what it had grabbed they say it's a dogfish from everything i've described it was brown with these little white dots and it made a loud kind of almost a croaking noise like a croaker does
sw2290B-ms98-a-0099 478.631750 489.533750 it it was the strangest thing it oh i'll never get over that to this day i don't want to get in the water anywhere around salt water because i'm sure one of those fish are there
