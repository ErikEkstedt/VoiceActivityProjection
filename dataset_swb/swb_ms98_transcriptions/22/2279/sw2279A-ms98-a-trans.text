sw2279A-ms98-a-0038 127.355875 138.388625 right well it's it's a beautiful city and but the problem is like first example when i was young they they took me to Las Vegas and that was the most boring place on earth [vocalized-noise] 
sw2279A-ms98-a-0039 138.388625 144.318375 [silence]
sw2279A-ms98-a-0040 144.318375 148.003750 yeah did uh did like did you go to Disneyland

sw2279A-ms98-a-0042 149.146250 157.861125 oh okay so but um now i don't know but um but let's see when i was eleven i went also to the Caribbean
sw2279A-ms98-a-0043 157.861125 170.026250 that that was fun that was and uh then after that i my sister lives in Turkey so when i was like fourteen fifteen i went i went to Turkey and this Christmas i went to Turkey but basically
sw2279A-ms98-a-0044 170.026250 180.303500 it's uh for the past couple of years uh i since my parents are are well i'm from Argentina and my parents live down there so all the traveling i do is alone
sw2279A-ms98-a-0045 180.303500 188.476500 and uh we were never much of uh a very uh family thing you know may like go skiing in Vermont or something
sw2279A-ms98-a-0046 188.476500 199.613375 that was uh that was a lot of fun but what happens is we used to fight a lot so there's never much of a family [laughter] family thing you know one of those hell family vacations
sw2279A-ms98-a-0047 199.613375 201.735250 [noise]
sw2279A-ms98-a-0048 201.735250 205.042125 [silence]
sw2279A-ms98-a-0049 205.042125 206.440500 yeah
sw2279A-ms98-a-0050 206.440500 210.149500 [silence]
sw2279A-ms98-a-0051 210.149500 211.471375 yeah
sw2279A-ms98-a-0052 211.471375 218.039500 [silence]
sw2279A-ms98-a-0053 218.039500 226.890625 well my dad all he all he wanted to do was get money for us so he could buy us material things and
sw2279A-ms98-a-0054 226.890625 240.435500 and and to me you know it's like now i'm twenty two but i still feel you know it's like yeah we never threw a football or something and the way i was brought up and he wants me now he like he you know like he wants to be best friends now and it's very
sw2279A-ms98-a-0055 240.435500 248.633875 hard for me because you know it's like you grow up to be twenty years old and it's always the same man and then suddenly he sees that he's getting old
sw2279A-ms98-a-0056 248.633875 252.178750 and he wants to be best friends but uh you know it's like
sw2279A-ms98-a-0057 252.178750 264.395500 i can only express myself so much because you know of everything that he taught me you know that my family taught me which is very hard to change that all of a sudden from one year to the next and say i'm sorry you know it's like
sw2279A-ms98-a-0058 264.395500 269.115500 you know i love you and let's go out and do things together when i don't feel like it you know
sw2279A-ms98-a-0059 269.115500 281.412125 and so that's uh that the sa[me]- thing that you know its like when like like i've seen my uncle and his family you know does everything together and you know his kids are you know when his little girl was five years old and everything
sw2279A-ms98-a-0060 281.412125 285.740250 they uh they would go to the beach and she could go to sleep at two in the morning
sw2279A-ms98-a-0061 285.740250 300.329375 you know and uh i was brought up the same way if if it doesn't matter what age you have if just so long as you can get up to go to class the next morning you can stay up you know but his what he does is when he gets home he separates his his work from his house
sw2279A-ms98-a-0062 300.329375 302.125125 yeah
sw2279A-ms98-a-0063 302.125125 310.899500 [silence]
sw2279A-ms98-a-0064 310.899500 312.420000 yeah
sw2279A-ms98-a-0065 312.420000 317.038000 [silence]
sw2279A-ms98-a-0066 317.038000 327.809500 yeah yeah but uh it's just it's just something that you know my theory is you know when when you have kids and all you want to do well what i'll do is you know it like
sw2279A-ms98-a-0067 327.809500 337.999000 i mean you might have a problems but it's not your kids problems you know and you got to try to to be with them as much as you can and to you know like thing is is that you know like if
sw2279A-ms98-a-0068 337.999000 343.724250 if they would ever happen to have a drug problem suppose that they could feel comfortable coming to me and saying i got a problem
sw2279A-ms98-a-0069 343.724250 353.823000 you know and uh and that would make any parent feel good and bad at the same time you know first of all you're coming to me and let's see how we can get rid of the problem you know
sw2279A-ms98-a-0070 353.823000 361.957375 and that's uh that's very that's very hard to do because once you're best friends with your parents then i think everything go a lot better
sw2279A-ms98-a-0071 361.957375 376.304500 [silence]
sw2279A-ms98-a-0072 376.304500 377.719375 yeah
sw2279A-ms98-a-0073 377.719375 379.754500 [silence]
sw2279A-ms98-a-0074 379.754500 385.925000 yeah my my father was raising four ki[ds]- oh well three kids before he had me so it was uh
sw2279A-ms98-a-0075 385.925000 397.325875 you know you're trying to support uh four kids and it's pretty hard you know and i and i told them listen you could have had a lot of money if you would have only had two kids
sw2279A-ms98-a-0076 397.325875 403.276625 he goes yeah but then i wouldn't have you i go yeah but then you would have a lot of money you know [laughter] [noise]
sw2279A-ms98-a-0077 403.276625 404.872125 yeah
sw2279A-ms98-a-0078 404.872125 406.335500 [noise]
sw2279A-ms98-a-0079 406.335500 420.863875 but you know like four i mean four four children is expensive especially_1 when you consider like especially_1 for for me which i'm paying out of state tuition i'm paying you know three thousand no what is it two thousand six hundred dollars for one semester 
sw2279A-ms98-a-0080 420.863875 434.533625 and uh you know people say you know it's expensive for to send kids to college but if if an everybody would be a little bit responsible you know it's like what what does it cost it costs five hundred dollars a semester suppose that they go to a state college and they live at home 
sw2279A-ms98-a-0081 434.533625 437.703875 you know and well it costs two hundred dollars for books
sw2279A-ms98-a-0082 437.703875 445.076375 but you know seven hundred dollars a semester a lot of people can spare that if they planned ahead you know like
sw2279A-ms98-a-0083 445.076375 446.420125 [silence]
sw2279A-ms98-a-0084 446.420125 456.164500 i mean it's like if you plan a year ahead you can probably save up seven hundred dollars you know one thousand four hundred dollars to send your child to college you know
sw2279A-ms98-a-0085 456.164500 458.206375 [silence]
sw2279A-ms98-a-0086 458.206375 459.880250 oh oh excuse me
sw2279A-ms98-a-0087 459.880250 462.655000 [silence]
sw2279A-ms98-a-0088 462.655000 466.212000 well i i'm doing computer science computer engineering
sw2279A-ms98-a-0089 466.212000 470.320625 [silence]
sw2279A-ms98-a-0090 470.320625 475.197875 yeah and and now i'm looking for a job before they have to send me back home
sw2279A-ms98-a-0091 475.197875 482.414375 because since i'm an international student they want to send me back to Argentina well my dad wants me to go back so
sw2279A-ms98-a-0092 482.414375 486.752500 no no because if you go back there then you can never get out
sw2279A-ms98-a-0093 486.752500 489.794750 like you don't have any money to to get out
sw2279A-ms98-a-0094 489.794750 500.358875 so uh and uh i was thinking you know like oh my God you know i go back there and then and then i might get married there and then i will have kids there and then i'll never leave the place you know
sw2279A-ms98-a-0095 500.358875 510.553125 yeah i know and that's that's what happened to my brother he came to school up here and then when he went down there he was just so bad off you know from not being able to stay up here that
sw2279A-ms98-a-0096 510.553125 513.099875 his life just went down the drain so
sw2279A-ms98-a-0097 513.099875 514.786000 [silence]
