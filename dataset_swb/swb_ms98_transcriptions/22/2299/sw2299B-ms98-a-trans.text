sw2299B-ms98-a-0016 66.052000 74.619625 but then i just you know bundle it up and put it on the front you know the front walk ev[ery]- you know every Monday or every other Monday and
sw2299B-ms98-a-0017 74.619625 83.852875 have them_1 pick that up but that's the extent of what i've done i'd like to be able to do more the problem is with a lot of it is you have to go

sw2299B-ms98-a-0034 145.010875 151.242875 i'd i'd have to check into something like that because_1 i mean we don't drink a whole lot of soda around here you know but um 
sw2299B-ms98-a-0035 151.242875 160.105875 you know occasionally we have some around but you know for other kind of cans just to it'd probably only take aluminum cans like that don't they

sw2299B-ms98-a-0054 224.925250 230.016875 and i've bought you know i've bought greeting cards that are made out of recycled paper and i think they're just fine

sw2299B-ms98-a-0073 287.752250 295.460000 i think if you know the cities locally you know they'd get more programs going so that you could do that it'd make it a lot easier so
