sw2247A-ms98-a-0002 17.094625 18.813000 a type of work station
sw2247A-ms98-a-0003 18.813000 44.542125 [silence]
sw2247A-ms98-a-0004 44.542125 48.122125 is it a two eighty six or three eighty six base machine
sw2247A-ms98-a-0005 48.122125 51.660125 [silence]
sw2247A-ms98-a-0006 51.660125 53.463750 it's eighty eighty eight
sw2247A-ms98-a-0007 53.463750 55.489375 [silence]
sw2247A-ms98-a-0008 55.489375 58.365500 okay uh
sw2247A-ms98-a-0009 58.365500 59.831500 [silence]
sw2247A-ms98-a-0010 59.831500 65.200500 what type of uh utilizations do you make of it word processing obviously
sw2247A-ms98-a-0011 65.200500 79.186375 [silence]
sw2247A-ms98-a-0012 79.186375 85.302500 okay uh i use them both here at work and at home
sw2247A-ms98-a-0013 85.302500 89.618250 and i have IBM clones in both cases
sw2247A-ms98-a-0014 89.618250 95.724375 here at work i have the TI one thousand which is a three eighty six base mach[ine]- machine
sw2247A-ms98-a-0015 95.724375 97.723375 [silence]
sw2247A-ms98-a-0016 97.723375 101.302375 yes it is uh unfortunately i need all of it
sw2247A-ms98-a-0017 101.302375 109.420625 uh for example i was messing around with a spreadsheet this weekend that's a third of a meg in beta size
sw2247A-ms98-a-0018 109.420625 115.378250 and that i know that uh brings an eighty eighty eight machine to it's knees [laughter-because]
sw2247A-ms98-a-0019 115.378250 122.541500 i had taken it over from a friend who was working on it and he had a two eighty six machine and it brought it to it's knees
sw2247A-ms98-a-0020 122.541500 124.992875 just in the ability to handle
sw2247A-ms98-a-0021 124.992875 127.215500 and then i have uh
sw2247A-ms98-a-0022 127.215500 131.110375 a three eighty six FX a sixteen bit machine
sw2247A-ms98-a-0023 131.110375 134.471875 at home and i'm really pleased with it
sw2247A-ms98-a-0024 134.471875 144.916125 it manages to take care of all my home needs in terms of word processing and spreadsheets and uh databases database searches
sw2247A-ms98-a-0025 144.916125 149.176875 uh what i've gotten into more recently are the tools to use them
sw2247A-ms98-a-0026 149.176875 150.683500 have you
sw2247A-ms98-a-0027 150.683500 153.864000 to try to make them more effective and useful
sw2247A-ms98-a-0028 153.864000 155.252625 [silence]
sw2247A-ms98-a-0029 155.252625 158.725625 have you been uh struggling along those lines
sw2247A-ms98-a-0030 158.725625 177.926500 [silence]
sw2247A-ms98-a-0031 177.926500 184.465125 well i think you will be real pleased to get away from the banana as i used to call it it's uh
sw2247A-ms98-a-0032 184.465125 195.812625 i used it on uh some other machines in days gone by and was real pleased to leave it it was a real memory hog when you started making large block changes to it
sw2247A-ms98-a-0033 195.812625 200.769000 the at least the version i had tended to keep copies of that
sw2247A-ms98-a-0034 200.769000 206.600250 of what you were changing and deleting off in memory until all of all of a sudden you got a disc full error
sw2247A-ms98-a-0035 206.600250 208.512250 [silence]
sw2247A-ms98-a-0036 208.512250 211.310000 not a fun thing to try to recover from
sw2247A-ms98-a-0037 211.310000 212.913125 very frustrating
sw2247A-ms98-a-0038 212.913125 214.492875 [silence]
sw2247A-ms98-a-0039 214.492875 221.157875 uh but again i've been dealing with large files both data and and otherwise
sw2247A-ms98-a-0040 221.157875 223.481125 uh that was a
sw2247A-ms98-a-0041 223.481125 226.977250 engineering spec on B2
sw2247A-ms98-a-0042 226.977250 230.039125 you come here with the B level of specs
sw2247A-ms98-a-0043 230.039125 234.833250 [silence]
sw2247A-ms98-a-0044 234.833250 240.952750 well it's just a huge file that tries to describe the requirements of what you're trying to build
sw2247A-ms98-a-0045 240.952750 242.061875 [silence]
sw2247A-ms98-a-0046 242.061875 243.286125 uh
sw2247A-ms98-a-0047 243.286125 246.184000 to one level down from assistant description
sw2247A-ms98-a-0048 246.184000 254.758125 [silence]
sw2247A-ms98-a-0049 254.758125 256.569375 well i sure need them
sw2247A-ms98-a-0050 256.569375 269.389625 uh there's no way that i could begin to process and keep up with the kinds of information or the magnitude of information that i need to to try to do my job without them
sw2247A-ms98-a-0051 269.389625 275.263375 [silence]
sw2247A-ms98-a-0052 275.263375 283.931000 yes uh maybe you'll play around some and figure out how they can help you do different things
sw2247A-ms98-a-0053 283.931000 290.821875 i think that's when you you start deciding that you really need greater assets than you already have
sw2247A-ms98-a-0054 290.821875 294.040375 when you start seeing what all they can do for you
sw2247A-ms98-a-0055 294.040375 296.645375 [silence]
sw2247A-ms98-a-0056 296.645375 300.426375 well i understand that [laughter] [laughter-you] [laughter-know]
sw2247A-ms98-a-0057 300.426375 305.715375 uh if needs and wants were the same i'd have a four eighty six machine at home 
sw2247A-ms98-a-0058 305.715375 309.383875 [laughter] 
sw2247A-ms98-a-0059 309.383875 310.683250 right
sw2247A-ms98-a-0060 310.683250 313.500875 [silence]
sw2247A-ms98-a-0061 313.500875 317.162625 uh that's came out around the first of the year
sw2247A-ms98-a-0062 317.162625 325.766625 [silence]
sw2247A-ms98-a-0063 325.766625 329.984500 it does a few more things uh
sw2247A-ms98-a-0064 329.984500 331.653375 than
sw2247A-ms98-a-0065 331.653375 334.281875 had been available before
sw2247A-ms98-a-0066 334.281875 345.068125 but i'm not sure that it's such a massive improvement uh you know once you get passed thirty three megahertz all help is kind of lost in the in the translation
sw2247A-ms98-a-0067 345.068125 348.257250 because you no longer can think that fast anyway
sw2247A-ms98-a-0068 348.257250 349.527125 [silence]
sw2247A-ms98-a-0069 349.527125 352.005625 well okay i enjoyed our discussion
sw2247A-ms98-a-0070 352.005625 353.043875 [silence]
sw2247A-ms98-a-0071 353.043875 354.256875 you do the same
sw2247A-ms98-a-0072 354.256875 355.305000 bye
sw2247A-ms98-a-0073 355.305000 357.491750 [noise]
