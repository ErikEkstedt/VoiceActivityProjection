sw2255A-ms98-a-0061 191.655500 192.983750 [silence]
sw2255A-ms98-a-0062 192.983750 201.042875 yeah it's incredible that uh that they have to do that i mean some of the the schools give you a break they give the students a break where they can take their exams when they get back from from a tournament
sw2255A-ms98-a-0063 201.042875 209.484500 but uh these guys were actually on the road uh two thousand miles fr[om]- from home when they had to file their uh their final exams and send them in

sw2255A-ms98-a-0075 234.615750 242.863875 i think so too they plaid Duke and uh Duke has a lot to uh to atone for here last year that lost to Vegas in the finals by thirty points
sw2255A-ms98-a-0076 242.863875 245.704875 [silence]
sw2255A-ms98-a-0077 245.704875 249.481375 Kansas is a real surprise i didn't expect them to get that far

sw2255A-ms98-a-0082 260.190625 264.725625 they came out uh real hot in the first half Todd Davis hitting his three pointers
sw2255A-ms98-a-0083 264.725625 269.756750 yeah uh somebody took the fire out from under them they they weren't getting their shots anymore
sw2255A-ms98-a-0084 269.756750 278.483875 and Kansas just crept up on them and uh uh it was unbelievable because_1 they they did that a few years ago too when they were seated a lot lower and they won th[e]- the championship
sw2255A-ms98-a-0085 278.483875 280.400000 but i don't think they
sw2255A-ms98-a-0086 280.400000 283.877500 [silence]
sw2255A-ms98-a-0087 283.877500 288.190875 yeah well they they are just that much better they've got so many stars

sw2255A-ms98-a-0089 297.594250 307.483500 well sure i think anybody can can win on a given night but they have so much talents and the average age on that team is twenty two years old they've got a lot of fifth year seniors that are playing
sw2255A-ms98-a-0090 307.483500 308.550625 [silence]
sw2255A-ms98-a-0091 308.550625 315.507125 guys that are playing for long time uh they're playing Duke uh this weekend uh the average age on Duke's team is nineteen years old
sw2255A-ms98-a-0092 315.507125 321.756875 Vegas the average age is over twenty two so they've got just so much more experience than anybody else in the tournament right now
sw2255A-ms98-a-0093 321.756875 330.765625 but they're going to lose all those guys at the end of the season they're going to all turn pro i think Stacy Augmon's a senior and Larry Johnson i don't think i think he's uh is he a senior or junior
sw2255A-ms98-a-0094 330.765625 333.379500 i'm not Larry Johnson i think he's coming out this year

sw2255A-ms98-a-0129 443.017125 445.483750 i think Houston's playing really good ball lately
sw2255A-ms98-a-0130 445.483750 451.110625 ever since Akeem changed his uh first name to Hakeem [laughter] he added the H to the front

sw2255A-ms98-a-0137 465.924125 470.579375 [silence]
sw2255A-ms98-a-0138 470.579375 473.233250 Port[land]- Portland's looking awfully good

sw2255A-ms98-a-0140 478.468250 480.263000 Isiah Thomas Detroit
sw2255A-ms98-a-0141 480.263000 482.728750 Detroit Pistons they're not as good as they were last year
sw2255A-ms98-a-0142 482.728750 486.161125 [silence]
sw2255A-ms98-a-0143 486.161125 489.728750 they'll have to pick it up in the in the tournament then
sw2255A-ms98-a-0144 489.728750 491.083750 [silence]
sw2255A-ms98-a-0145 491.083750 493.874750 Chicago's playing really good ball with Michael Jordan
sw2255A-ms98-a-0146 493.874750 496.307125 and i think they finally put things together
sw2255A-ms98-a-0147 496.307125 501.154625 [silence]
sw2255A-ms98-a-0148 501.154625 510.310625 yeah well Chicago they they've been struggling last couple of years and they've had a good team for the past few years ever since they had Michael Jordan but they never did seem to make an impact on the play-offs
sw2255A-ms98-a-0149 510.310625 513.579250 i think this year they're going to really uh show some talent
sw2255A-ms98-a-0150 513.579250 514.866875 [silence]
sw2255A-ms98-a-0151 514.866875 516.150750 oh yeah

sw2255A-ms98-a-0155 530.704375 533.300625 Boston Celtics right
sw2255A-ms98-a-0156 533.300625 537.459125 [silence]
sw2255A-ms98-a-0157 537.459125 543.141875 yeah i don't think the Celtics quite have the overall talent that it takes to win the NBA this year
sw2255A-ms98-a-0158 543.141875 547.877875 they've got good individual players but some are getting old Robert Parish is thirty seven years old
sw2255A-ms98-a-0159 547.877875 549.644375 he's still playing center
sw2255A-ms98-a-0160 549.644375 553.930750 and uh Larry Bird's talking about retirement here i guess in another year
sw2255A-ms98-a-0161 553.930750 555.225625 yeah

sw2255A-ms98-a-0163 556.740500 558.864875 but they're bringing in some good young players too
sw2255A-ms98-a-0164 558.864875 560.146250 which is good

sw2255A-ms98-a-0166 561.272875 571.218500 i'm i've always favored Milwaukee being from that area and they've made some good moves in personnel but i don't see them as having the the type of talent that will win the NBA this year
sw2255A-ms98-a-0167 571.218500 576.631750 they have to get by Detroit and Chicago [laughter] i think either one of them is a real tough challenge for them

sw2255A-ms98-a-0169 580.841500 584.473750 but yeah i don't think Atlanta would be much as much a problem as Chicago
