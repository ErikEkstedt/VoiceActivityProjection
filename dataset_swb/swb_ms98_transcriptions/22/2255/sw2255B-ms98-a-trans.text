sw2255B-ms98-a-0131 397.151500 399.123000 yeah that's all right
sw2255B-ms98-a-0132 399.123000 402.627000 that be all right between them and

sw2255B-ms98-a-0155 489.338250 491.638125 but i think that's what usually happens to them

sw2255B-ms98-a-0157 492.816000 493.977750 um-hum

sw2255B-ms98-a-0162 511.507500 515.429375 i think also because_1 they done took some of the pressure off of him
sw2255B-ms98-a-0163 515.429375 520.187125 you know they because_1 they always think it's all him and see there's not you know
sw2255B-ms98-a-0164 520.187125 532.445250 that's not good but i mean everybody's always looking at him that's just like Larry Bird and um uh God Larry Bird what team does he play for Celtics
