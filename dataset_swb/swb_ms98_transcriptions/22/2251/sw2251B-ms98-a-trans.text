sw2251B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.398375 [noise]
sw2251B-ms98-a-0002 0.398375 6.475125 an interesting uh point about sentencing by the judge alone doing away with a jury
sw2251B-ms98-a-0003 6.475125 20.799375 i don't know if i'd be willing to accept the um abuses that would come along with that and that the it'd be relatively easy to get some bad decisions or to even get to the judge from a standpoint of bribery but 
sw2251B-ms98-a-0004 20.799375 33.541875 or even if he just through years of being on the bench just becomes uh out of touch with uh the population and he only sees the bad side of life so much that he just ends up making bad decisions
sw2251B-ms98-a-0005 33.541875 43.676375 however the complexity of some of these uh cases it's just they spend more time educating the jury up to the point where they can make a decision
sw2251B-ms98-a-0006 43.676375 55.033875 then it would take if the judge just made the decision especially when it is purely um noncriminal uh litigation type uh whatever you want to call it the term
sw2251B-ms98-a-0007 55.033875 60.041250 civil uh suits as it were or even some corporate uh law
sw2251B-ms98-a-0008 60.041250 69.554375 when there's not any individual involved and some of those are solved without a a jury but uh some some do choose to go before it
sw2251B-ms98-a-0009 69.554375 82.299750 um what do you think about the aspect of unanimous jury when they do have a jury must all six or twelve uh agree before the the topic be final or or the verdict be final
sw2251B-ms98-a-0010 82.299750 117.032250 [silence]
sw2251B-ms98-a-0011 117.032250 124.422000 okay if it the only thing that i was thinking about as far as having if you had one holdout out of say twelve
sw2251B-ms98-a-0012 124.422000 137.349875 then is it reasonable or is it or could you assume that there must be some reason for that person to be holding out and obviously the other eleven or five cannot convince this person
sw2251B-ms98-a-0013 137.349875 144.330250 that uh they should vote it one way or the other so maybe it is worth having that extra little
sw2251B-ms98-a-0014 144.330250 146.463375 or going to the the
sw2251B-ms98-a-0015 146.463375 147.829250 very
sw2251B-ms98-a-0016 147.829250 152.348875 farthest uh safeguard that can be done and uh
sw2251B-ms98-a-0017 152.348875 155.633000 trying not to get a wrong decision
sw2251B-ms98-a-0018 155.633000 157.734750 [silence]
sw2251B-ms98-a-0019 157.734750 166.790000 the uh system as it stands now i think if if the juries were done away with the judge could render a decision much quicker
sw2251B-ms98-a-0020 166.790000 174.691375 uh and you'd you'd feed more people through the courts as it were don't know where we'd put them once we got them through your courts but uh
sw2251B-ms98-a-0021 174.691375 186.306000 i think the rate of processing is just about uh reached the rate of housing anyway so keep the keep the norm[al]- as it is can't upset the system very much
sw2251B-ms98-a-0022 186.306000 196.790875 [silence]
sw2251B-ms98-a-0023 196.790875 199.747875 probably yeah i would imagine the judge could throw it out
sw2251B-ms98-a-0024 199.747875 202.227750 [silence]
sw2251B-ms98-a-0025 202.227750 212.481250 i would imagine that's left up to the judge i i would assume he could consider it a contempt of court and and uh but anything he wanted whatever his limits are on contempt of court
sw2251B-ms98-a-0026 212.481250 215.999375 [silence]
sw2251B-ms98-a-0027 215.999375 221.723375 certainly makes sense because some of this stuff is you know y[ou]- you're just doing this to do this you know [laughter-it's]
sw2251B-ms98-a-0028 221.723375 223.890625 just doesn't make sense
sw2251B-ms98-a-0029 223.890625 232.141375 so that's pretty bad [noise] a friend of mine is a is a judge here in the -[w]ell actually you know it McKinney because we're in Collin County
sw2251B-ms98-a-0030 232.141375 246.730375 and he is uh just recently changed from hearing all the the DWI type stuff to uh doing what they call more of a family court where he gets to go listen to all the divorces so it wasn't much of a step up as it were
sw2251B-ms98-a-0031 246.730375 257.499250 um it's really tough he says in a lot of cases where he has to make the decision so i guess in a lot of those cases it's it's all up to him as oppose to a jury
sw2251B-ms98-a-0032 257.499250 262.193875 and there's just no good choice as to where to put the kids sometimes or
sw2251B-ms98-a-0033 262.193875 267.303625 and of course there couples get kind of spiteful at times and
sw2251B-ms98-a-0034 267.303625 271.396250 and you hear it all through the worst side of people throughout the whole time
sw2251B-ms98-a-0035 271.396250 273.393125 [silence]
sw2251B-ms98-a-0036 273.393125 275.897875 well let me think here
sw2251B-ms98-a-0037 275.897875 277.156875 um
sw2251B-ms98-a-0038 277.156875 278.193750 [silence]
sw2251B-ms98-a-0039 278.193750 281.340000 as far as the judge making the decision
sw2251B-ms98-a-0040 281.340000 294.878875 [silence]
sw2251B-ms98-a-0041 294.878875 296.225500 uh-huh
sw2251B-ms98-a-0042 296.225500 300.944375 [silence]
sw2251B-ms98-a-0043 300.944375 302.906750 yeah that's true
sw2251B-ms98-a-0044 302.906750 307.358250 but then look at the group that tends to accept jury duty
sw2251B-ms98-a-0045 307.358250 318.750000 you you either have the person who who is uh the type of individual who can work for a large corporation that can afford to pay them you know let them go
sw2251B-ms98-a-0046 318.750000 324.195500 and and those are shall we say blue collar that that
sw2251B-ms98-a-0047 324.195500 336.658250 your work the assembly line type or technician some engineering uh you may not have the the self-employed businessman willing to go because he though he may be
sw2251B-ms98-a-0048 336.658250 349.126875 current on all you know several social issues and have opinions on things like that he just doesn't want to take his time to go to the jury duty so he probably doesn't vote either so he doesn't get called in some counties
sw2251B-ms98-a-0049 349.126875 362.178875 so it i don't know whether it would be wiser to have an educated judge even though he may get uh out of touch after a while or whether it would be uh worth it to stick to the class of people that end up there
sw2251B-ms98-a-0050 362.178875 363.543250 [silence]
sw2251B-ms98-a-0051 363.543250 374.039500 though i have had a judge fact this very judge friend of mine say that he uh does not like to have people on the jury that are from uh the electronics industry
sw2251B-ms98-a-0052 374.039500 380.319500 and i said well me being from the electronics industry i'll bite why [laughter] why don't you like it and he said well 
sw2251B-ms98-a-0053 380.319500 389.795875 he said the majority of them uh tend to dive into their little world of of electronics and be very technically minded and be very absorbed with what their field is
sw2251B-ms98-a-0054 389.795875 402.455625 and they usually don't um read outside their field they don't read social type uh papers they don't they're not up to date on various uh current affairs as it were and
sw2251B-ms98-a-0055 402.455625 414.432625 and i said well that that's quite possible i said i've discussed some topics with people even over this situation and and discovered some views that i hadn't thought of in a while i just wondered if i got out of my little realm
sw2251B-ms98-a-0056 414.432625 418.391375 uh if i wouldn't run into people with some more diverse views 
sw2251B-ms98-a-0057 418.391375 428.169375 but uh my realm is pretty well technical and those who you know friends i have are usually we discuss technical items and we don't uh try to follow the world's problems
sw2251B-ms98-a-0058 428.169375 430.478500 i guess it's too frustrating [laughter]
sw2251B-ms98-a-0059 430.478500 431.204875 [noise]
sw2251B-ms98-a-0060 431.204875 432.403875 so
sw2251B-ms98-a-0061 432.403875 438.372500 well i think we've managed to kill a little time on the topic and we'll go ahead and
sw2251B-ms98-a-0062 438.372500 440.269375 we'll go ahead and call you another day maybe
sw2251B-ms98-a-0063 440.269375 441.359250 [silence]
sw2251B-ms98-a-0064 441.359250 443.041375 okay bye
sw2251B-ms98-a-0065 443.041375 444.533375 [noise]
