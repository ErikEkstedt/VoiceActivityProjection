sw2204B-ms98-a-0002 0.503375 2.253625 [silence]
sw2204B-ms98-a-0003 2.253625 3.582500 right
sw2204B-ms98-a-0004 3.582500 28.266375 [silence]
sw2204B-ms98-a-0005 28.266375 39.102500 yes i- i have my primary experience has been as uh an expert witness an[d]- and uh and two murder trials
sw2204B-ms98-a-0006 39.102500 51.994000 and uh in each case it was a retrial and the sentencing was the same each time which happened in the state of Florida happened to be uh death
sw2204B-ms98-a-0007 51.994000 64.300750 but in terms of i well the question also was in terms of mandatory sentencing or mandatory sentences for uh certain crimes
sw2204B-ms98-a-0008 64.300750 66.780125 i think
sw2204B-ms98-a-0009 66.780125 71.967375 depending on uh in certain crimes i think that they should be mandatory
sw2204B-ms98-a-0010 71.967375 75.167000 for example uh armed robbery
sw2204B-ms98-a-0011 75.167000 82.500750 uh if we have convicted i think uh plea bargaining should should be uh a thing of the past
sw2204B-ms98-a-0012 82.500750 84.158875 um
sw2204B-ms98-a-0013 84.158875 86.931875 certain types of uh
sw2204B-ms98-a-0014 86.931875 88.977875 you know homicides
sw2204B-ms98-a-0015 88.977875 94.091000 [silence]
sw2204B-ms98-a-0016 94.091000 105.622500 yes in in homicides related to other than i guess what are called uh crimes of passion uh for example you know as you as you very well know
sw2204B-ms98-a-0017 105.622500 108.505000 the great majority of homicides are
sw2204B-ms98-a-0018 108.505000 113.744500 people murdering other people they know mostly people they know
sw2204B-ms98-a-0019 113.744500 124.508375 so in those instances uh that's uh i think that there is some leeway there what wa[s]- is interesting in this regard is the recent case in New Hampshire
sw2204B-ms98-a-0020 124.508375 126.472250 uh the schoolteacher
sw2204B-ms98-a-0021 126.472250 129.032625 and the life sentence uh she received
sw2204B-ms98-a-0022 129.032625 130.887875 [silence]
sw2204B-ms98-a-0023 130.887875 132.454875 [laughter-yes]
sw2204B-ms98-a-0024 132.454875 134.597875 and it came very quickly surprisingly
sw2204B-ms98-a-0025 134.597875 141.004875 uh i guess it was uh they brought in their verdict and sentence at the same time did they not
sw2204B-ms98-a-0026 141.004875 144.239875 [silence]
sw2204B-ms98-a-0027 144.239875 145.709250 um-hum
sw2204B-ms98-a-0028 145.709250 163.277750 [silence]

sw2204B-ms98-a-0031 172.519625 174.518000 [laughter]
sw2204B-ms98-a-0032 174.518000 181.721875 well in answer to you know answer to the question though i still think the sentencing should be in the hands of the jury even though as you say there are some
sw2204B-ms98-a-0033 181.721875 192.539250 uh people who are reluctant i do not think again in the matter of uh uh that that judges should have the
sw2204B-ms98-a-0034 192.539250 194.015125 uh
sw2204B-ms98-a-0035 194.015125 195.736375 [silence]
sw2204B-ms98-a-0036 195.736375 205.428375 the upper hand or the only hand in that sense because i think if but i i've never served on a jury you probably know this better than i um
sw2204B-ms98-a-0037 205.428375 207.231625 [silence]
sw2204B-ms98-a-0038 207.231625 214.277500 if the jury does their job and of course there are those on the jury that do not i'm sure but and ask the questions and
sw2204B-ms98-a-0039 214.277500 222.522750 uh correctly and then one of things i've always wondered is uh the ability of jurors to to ask questions
sw2204B-ms98-a-0040 222.522750 229.418750 [silence]
sw2204B-ms98-a-0041 229.418750 236.892125 well that that that [laughter-and] that's an interesting point i've never i you know i've thought about it i've asked myself you know this question before
sw2204B-ms98-a-0042 236.892125 246.156500 i've never taken the time to do the research to answer my own question but i know that at least during the deliberations of the jury
sw2204B-ms98-a-0043 246.156500 248.262625 they can ask questions
sw2204B-ms98-a-0044 248.262625 251.631500 [silence]
