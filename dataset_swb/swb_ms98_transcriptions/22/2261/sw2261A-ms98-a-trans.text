sw2261A-ms98-a-0002 0.880000 10.214250 first and foremost my immediate fix for the federal budget would be a two percent straight across the board cut in federal spending in all departments
sw2261A-ms98-a-0003 10.214250 15.911750 [silence]
sw2261A-ms98-a-0004 15.911750 17.525375 yes
sw2261A-ms98-a-0005 17.525375 43.407500 [silence]
sw2261A-ms98-a-0006 43.407500 47.997875 gross national product or profit okay
sw2261A-ms98-a-0007 47.997875 53.444500 i'm not knowledgeable in that area so i can only agree with what you're saying
sw2261A-ms98-a-0008 53.444500 69.957875 [silence]
sw2261A-ms98-a-0009 69.957875 71.270125 um-hum
sw2261A-ms98-a-0010 71.270125 76.185000 seems fair to me [laughter] also individual level
sw2261A-ms98-a-0011 76.185000 101.927500 [silence]
sw2261A-ms98-a-0012 101.927500 103.501375 um-hum
sw2261A-ms98-a-0013 103.501375 108.416875 well i am awfully bored with uh every
sw2261A-ms98-a-0014 108.416875 117.424875 every tax change uh supposedly having all these built in benefits for the poor because
sw2261A-ms98-a-0015 117.424875 126.070000 i think we have such a mismanagement of the funds that are designated for the poor so much graft
sw2261A-ms98-a-0016 126.070000 134.115500 and so much misspending that that money doesn't necessarily go where it's supposed to go
sw2261A-ms98-a-0017 134.115500 142.103000 uh i know you don't ever cutout greed and corruption but i think the management of the
sw2261A-ms98-a-0018 142.103000 155.238750 welfare dollar needs to come back t[o]- to the local levels because the local people know exactly who needs that money and who doesn't need that money when it's directed from afar
sw2261A-ms98-a-0019 155.238750 159.930250 i think the chance for misspending is greater
sw2261A-ms98-a-0020 159.930250 168.339375 i i suppose i'm thinking more in terms i i'm not thinking in terms of increasing taxes i'm just thinking for a quick fix
sw2261A-ms98-a-0021 168.339375 174.270000 uh a cut in federal spending is i guess my solution
sw2261A-ms98-a-0022 174.270000 183.661125 [silence]
sw2261A-ms98-a-0023 183.661125 193.400875 i know [laughter] that's well maybe that's what i'm saying as long as greed and corruption is in there how do we get away from that though
sw2261A-ms98-a-0024 193.400875 209.577875 [silence]
sw2261A-ms98-a-0025 209.577875 210.628875 right

sw2261A-ms98-a-0031 229.697250 238.387500 i think that's wonderful when do we first when do we then start giving them their lifetime income as a retired politician
sw2261A-ms98-a-0032 238.387500 240.569000 [silence]
sw2261A-ms98-a-0033 240.569000 241.996750 but we do don't we
sw2261A-ms98-a-0034 241.996750 243.279500 [silence]
sw2261A-ms98-a-0035 243.279500 250.446750 [laughter-yes] i know many people have said well if you throw everyone out and start over but then you 
sw2261A-ms98-a-0036 250.446750 264.629625 uh the the amount of them who would be on lifetime income is so stupendous there's they have locked their benefits in to the point that once they've served two terms they're on gravy train anyway
sw2261A-ms98-a-0037 264.629625 268.886875 yes i think you're right i don't think we should ever give them_1 a lifetime thing
sw2261A-ms98-a-0038 268.886875 280.870625 [silence]
sw2261A-ms98-a-0039 280.870625 286.884000 it they don't they speak with fork and tongue don't [laughter-they]
sw2261A-ms98-a-0040 286.884000 299.558750 at least we're in agreement on that aren't we [laughter] i'm afraid i have no other thoughts on fixes and i'm not really sure that they would accept our suggestions anyhow
sw2261A-ms98-a-0041 299.558750 316.407875 [silence]
sw2261A-ms98-a-0042 316.407875 317.444375 um-hum
sw2261A-ms98-a-0043 317.444375 322.265375 [silence]
sw2261A-ms98-a-0044 322.265375 324.268000 how do they react then
sw2261A-ms98-a-0045 324.268000 326.670875 [silence]
sw2261A-ms98-a-0046 326.670875 336.870375 we're prosecuted if we simply don't pay our taxes so i'm not real sure how you believe then that eventually there'll be an overthrow
sw2261A-ms98-a-0047 336.870375 341.112250 we know communism doesn't work what do we do next
sw2261A-ms98-a-0048 341.112250 349.075625 [silence]
sw2261A-ms98-a-0049 349.075625 360.618375 uh i heard uh someone uh supposedly an authority say[ing]- speaking on TV saying that the interest rate as we have known it in the past will never be the
sw2261A-ms98-a-0050 360.618375 372.487250 that high again and he was speaking in senior citizens living on their incomes of from interest CD interest and that sort of interest i think
sw2261A-ms98-a-0051 372.487250 380.730750 the voting block of senior citizens is a tremendous voting block too but every voting block is
sw2261A-ms98-a-0052 380.730750 390.017250 slapped and toward their own special interest and i think that makes it doubly difficult to make a change i guess i'm saying we're all selfish
sw2261A-ms98-a-0053 390.017250 404.529625 [silence]
sw2261A-ms98-a-0054 404.529625 406.405250 yes that's true
sw2261A-ms98-a-0055 406.405250 408.045625 [silence]
sw2261A-ms98-a-0056 408.045625 414.621750 it doesn't seem to workout that way [laughter-though] [laughter-does] [laughter-it] i think that the lobbyist uh
sw2261A-ms98-a-0057 414.621750 416.138500 [silence]
sw2261A-ms98-a-0058 416.138500 426.066375 are so protecting what they have in the budget that it doesn't seem to work that every man has to pay his own fair share and maybe that's why corporate America gets away with what they're doing
sw2261A-ms98-a-0059 426.066375 428.649875 because of the kickbacks and et cetera
sw2261A-ms98-a-0060 428.649875 430.020750 [silence]
sw2261A-ms98-a-0061 430.020750 435.543000 i'm a bit of a a pessimist i don't see a change in my lifetime i'm afraid
sw2261A-ms98-a-0062 435.543000 439.485750 [silence]
sw2261A-ms98-a-0063 439.485750 442.124500 you're younger perhaps you can foresee one

sw2261A-ms98-a-0068 455.100500 464.981125 yes i think you're right i'm just saying that i don't think the American people are at this point rebellious enough that it will happen in my lifetime
sw2261A-ms98-a-0069 464.981125 470.850125 yes i think eventually the system will change i still think we have the best system
sw2261A-ms98-a-0070 470.850125 475.725250 uh with the elected officials i i'm not sure that uh
sw2261A-ms98-a-0071 475.725250 478.292500 it's working right now though
sw2261A-ms98-a-0072 478.292500 485.784375 [silence]
