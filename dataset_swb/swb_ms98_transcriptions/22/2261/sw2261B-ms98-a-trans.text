sw2261B-ms98-a-0004 16.020375 28.697125 two perc[ent]- two percent is a good choice but to as far as to increase tax revenues coming in you need to a redesigning of the entire tax structure itself corporate America is getting away with bloody murder
sw2261B-ms98-a-0005 28.697125 43.099875 where as the people out here are having to pay such a high amount of their actual bring home salaries into taxes the corporations are getting off easy because_1 they're actually paying in less than five percent of their gross national product
sw2261B-ms98-a-0006 43.099875 46.400875 or their or their

sw2261B-ms98-a-0009 53.375250 58.020375 if they made it straight across the board everybody pay five percent
sw2261B-ms98-a-0010 58.020375 59.872375 if their gross
sw2261B-ms98-a-0011 59.872375 62.193250 national profit
sw2261B-ms98-a-0012 62.193250 63.529000 was

sw2261B-ms98-a-0018 85.056250 94.987500 overall it just seem like they've modified the tax laws so bad just the last five years the rich is it's definitely case that the rich are getting richer and the working people
sw2261B-ms98-a-0019 94.987500 97.651625 middle class and
sw2261B-ms98-a-0020 97.651625 103.441375 you know the lower middle class and the upper middle class are having to carry the entire burden
sw2261B-ms98-a-0021 103.441375 174.652500 [silence]
sw2261B-ms98-a-0022 174.652500 178.699750 as long as you got congressmen and senators that are getting kick[backs]- 
sw2261B-ms98-a-0023 178.699750 183.922250 kickbacks from these different companies that are getting awarded for the defense contracts that's never going to happen

sw2261B-ms98-a-0025 197.760875 200.250250 the one thing that i
sw2261B-ms98-a-0026 200.250250 202.200500 had thought about
sw2261B-ms98-a-0027 202.200500 203.633750 [silence]
sw2261B-ms98-a-0028 203.633750 210.735000 to help correct that problem you've got career politicians that spend thirty forty years in Washington that's all they have ever done
sw2261B-ms98-a-0029 210.735000 216.784625 after they've been there that long they're so deep rooted with their the old boy network
sw2261B-ms98-a-0030 216.784625 217.918875 [silence]
sw2261B-ms98-a-0031 217.918875 224.422250 i think by limiting the number of consecutive terms a congressman or senator can hold whether it be a state congressman
sw2261B-ms98-a-0032 224.422250 228.677375 or senator or at the national level limiting the two terms and then they've got to sit out one
sw2261B-ms98-a-0033 228.677375 238.257750 [silence]
sw2261B-ms98-a-0034 238.257750 240.776375 i don't think we should ever give them_1 a lifetime income
sw2261B-ms98-a-0035 240.776375 242.366750 [silence]
sw2261B-ms98-a-0036 242.366750 243.485375 unfortunately

sw2261B-ms98-a-0038 269.644500 274.047375 and they're the ones that have screamed so mu[ch]- m[uch]- much about
sw2261B-ms98-a-0039 274.047375 280.983250 that don't want to increase taxes and they don't want to do this but every year they vote themselves in a very healthy pay raise
sw2261B-ms98-a-0040 280.983250 300.295125 [silence]
sw2261B-ms98-a-0041 300.295125 303.230250 i th[ink]- eventually it's going get to the point where
sw2261B-ms98-a-0042 303.230250 307.227250 there's going to be a majority of the American people that have had enough of what it's
sw2261B-ms98-a-0043 307.227250 309.387250 finally come to we're
sw2261B-ms98-a-0044 309.387250 312.256875 you getting so far down to where
sw2261B-ms98-a-0045 312.256875 317.040250 you're being taxed so far down where you can't even afford to change your mind
sw2261B-ms98-a-0046 317.040250 320.995000 it's going to come to a point where the average American citizens say we've had enough
sw2261B-ms98-a-0047 320.995000 342.502375 [silence]
sw2261B-ms98-a-0048 342.502375 347.994000 well in the form of capitalism that we've got apparently that's not working real good either
sw2261B-ms98-a-0049 347.994000 397.773875 [silence]
sw2261B-ms98-a-0050 397.773875 400.841500 maybe not a case of everybody being selfish 
sw2261B-ms98-a-0051 400.841500 404.818125 every man carry their own fair burden but not somebody else's

sw2261B-ms98-a-0055 446.833750 449.030500 as far as when it'll happen

sw2261B-ms98-a-0057 450.398875 454.522750 that i'm not real sure of if it will happen i have no doubt
sw2261B-ms98-a-0058 454.522750 481.097875 [silence]
sw2261B-ms98-a-0059 481.097875 487.827375 it is the best system that's out there right now but it does need some fine tuning at this point
sw2261B-ms98-a-0060 487.827375 489.016000 [silence]
sw2261B-ms98-a-0061 489.016000 490.840500 okay nice talking to you bye
