sw2221A-ms98-a-0002 1.785000 4.651750 what do you think about um
sw2221A-ms98-a-0003 4.651750 10.235000 the way the criminal justice system handles trials
sw2221A-ms98-a-0004 10.235000 11.576750 [silence]

sw2221A-ms98-a-0018 66.211875 68.478625 [silence]
sw2221A-ms98-a-0019 68.478625 81.995000 well i think the six is called a Grand Jury and that's mostly to decide whether or not the person's actually going to stand trial or it's whether they're acquitted or whether they're actually going to be accused of
sw2221A-ms98-a-0020 81.995000 84.965125 you know and held over for trial
sw2221A-ms98-a-0021 84.965125 94.467250 [silence]
sw2221A-ms98-a-0022 94.467250 102.998125 yeah i don't know i- i think that uh i know that judges aren't supposed to be crooked however
sw2221A-ms98-a-0023 102.998125 103.981875 [silence]
sw2221A-ms98-a-0024 103.981875 118.303125 yeah it seems like if you break the sentencing away from the jury and give it y[ou]- give it to one person you're letting there be a whole lot more of an opportunity for something to either go wrong
sw2221A-ms98-a-0025 118.303125 130.259250 or for you know if if if the judge is not of high moral standards he could be bought off at much easier than twelve people could
sw2221A-ms98-a-0026 130.259250 153.999125 [silence]
sw2221A-ms98-a-0027 153.999125 155.724625 um-hum

sw2221A-ms98-a-0029 157.253500 160.487875 it's not so much that i that
sw2221A-ms98-a-0030 160.487875 170.792375 i haven't seen a lot of really bad sentences passed either by trials or by judges what bothers me is that uh they really don't mean anything
sw2221A-ms98-a-0031 170.792375 181.496875 someone could be sentenced to thirty five years and yet you know th[e]- the parole system uh it's going to let them out in in three years for good behavior
sw2221A-ms98-a-0032 181.496875 182.492125 [silence]
sw2221A-ms98-a-0033 182.492125 184.276875 no it's not
sw2221A-ms98-a-0034 184.276875 186.239125 [silence]
sw2221A-ms98-a-0035 186.239125 187.801250 um-hum
sw2221A-ms98-a-0036 187.801250 193.201375 [silence]
sw2221A-ms98-a-0037 193.201375 196.498250 oh i think they're all overcrowded
sw2221A-ms98-a-0038 196.498250 202.491125 they've uh i think i heard Fort Worth that uh
sw2221A-ms98-a-0039 202.491125 212.262875 they've been ordered to do something because their jail is so overcrowd[ed]- they're not allowed to accept any new inmates now what are they supposed to do
sw2221A-ms98-a-0040 212.262875 217.262875 well no i mean they're not allowed to accept any new inmates
sw2221A-ms98-a-0041 217.262875 221.495125 so what are they supposed to do with people that they need to put in jail you [laughter-know]
sw2221A-ms98-a-0042 221.495125 223.491625 [silence]
sw2221A-ms98-a-0043 223.491625 224.807875 there
sw2221A-ms98-a-0044 224.807875 226.261750 yeah
sw2221A-ms98-a-0045 226.261750 231.993375 [silence]
sw2221A-ms98-a-0046 231.993375 238.983625 um-hum something that is working and i- i- i really like the system of house arrest
sw2221A-ms98-a-0047 238.983625 243.775500 where uh a someone's wear someone wears a bracelet
sw2221A-ms98-a-0048 243.775500 256.773375 like a ankle bracelet that's a monitor and they are not allowed i mean th[e]- some of them are even allowed to work they can go to their regular job they come home they have to be home by such and such a time
sw2221A-ms98-a-0049 256.773375 260.746375 they're instructed uh
sw2221A-ms98-a-0050 260.746375 270.949625 so that this this electronic monitor is turned on at at a certain time and it connects them up to a system where they know their whereabouts
sw2221A-ms98-a-0051 270.949625 272.680500 and uh
sw2221A-ms98-a-0052 272.680500 278.959000 they can put a they usually install a video monitor in the house
sw2221A-ms98-a-0053 278.959000 286.581000 and when the parole officer calls to check on them they're instructed to turn it on and stand in front of it
sw2221A-ms98-a-0054 286.581000 301.457250 so that they can see that this person is actually at home in their house doing what they're supposed to be doing and that's working rather well that's a good system that allows people to actually continue to be productive members of society while
sw2221A-ms98-a-0055 301.457250 302.977500 they're
sw2221A-ms98-a-0056 302.977500 307.486750 you know paying back for whatever crime they've committed
sw2221A-ms98-a-0057 307.486750 314.300875 [silence]
sw2221A-ms98-a-0058 314.300875 315.998125 oh yeah
sw2221A-ms98-a-0059 315.998125 317.330875 yeah
sw2221A-ms98-a-0060 317.330875 320.799625 [silence]
sw2221A-ms98-a-0061 320.799625 327.682875 um-hum i've i've really i could go on for hours about the [laughter-criminal] [laughter-justice] system and what i think we ought to do about it but
sw2221A-ms98-a-0062 327.682875 328.733750 [silence]
sw2221A-ms98-a-0063 328.733750 334.277250 w[ell]- something that i really don't understand is when someone goes to jail
sw2221A-ms98-a-0064 334.277250 338.661250 and they have a job in jail and they work
sw2221A-ms98-a-0065 338.661250 346.958875 that they should i and this may sound cruel but i do not think that they should be allowed cigarettes
sw2221A-ms98-a-0066 346.958875 352.792875 i mean they're in jail for crying out loud what do they need cigarettes for
sw2221A-ms98-a-0067 352.792875 360.480500 [silence]
sw2221A-ms98-a-0068 360.480500 361.999875 um-hum
sw2221A-ms98-a-0069 361.999875 367.235250 [silence]
sw2221A-ms98-a-0070 367.235250 369.232750 um-hum
sw2221A-ms98-a-0071 369.232750 372.242750 oh i think that's a wonderful idea
sw2221A-ms98-a-0072 372.242750 381.263875 [silence]
sw2221A-ms98-a-0073 381.263875 384.733125 more than that more than that
sw2221A-ms98-a-0074 384.733125 387.779750 [silence]
sw2221A-ms98-a-0075 387.779750 389.495875 i know
sw2221A-ms98-a-0076 389.495875 391.809375 [silence]
sw2221A-ms98-a-0077 391.809375 400.985500 the thing that the thing that gets me is that while we're supporting them they're working when they get out of jail they get handed all that money
sw2221A-ms98-a-0078 400.985500 408.724000 that really ticks me off i think that while they are in jail and they are working their wages
sw2221A-ms98-a-0079 408.724000 419.731375 should go like i don't know they could uh some percentage like eighty five percent of their wages should go toward their room and board
sw2221A-ms98-a-0080 419.731375 425.778500 [vocalized-noise] figured on um a whatever basis how much it costs to actually support them for a year
sw2221A-ms98-a-0081 425.778500 433.498375 and when they get out they should have uh i don't know you know some reasonable amount of money
sw2221A-ms98-a-0082 433.498375 442.711250 to start like a couple of thousand dollars but there should be a limit over which they that it all goes back to the State anything that they've earned while they're in prison
sw2221A-ms98-a-0083 442.711250 450.742875 should go back to the State except for that you know there needs to be some allowance for when someone gets out that they have some money to start with
sw2221A-ms98-a-0084 450.742875 452.986625 [silence]
sw2221A-ms98-a-0085 452.986625 458.995125 exactly absolutely that's the part that i really think we need to change
sw2221A-ms98-a-0086 458.995125 471.687375 [silence]
sw2221A-ms98-a-0087 471.687375 473.989375 has nothing right
sw2221A-ms98-a-0088 473.989375 482.271250 [silence]
sw2221A-ms98-a-0089 482.271250 484.260000 absolutely
sw2221A-ms98-a-0090 484.260000 492.493000 [silence]
sw2221A-ms98-a-0091 492.493000 493.977000 yeah
sw2221A-ms98-a-0092 493.977000 502.215250 [silence]
sw2221A-ms98-a-0093 502.215250 507.737250 um-hum i think it works much better if it's if it's the actual jury
sw2221A-ms98-a-0094 507.737250 511.150000 [silence]
sw2221A-ms98-a-0095 511.150000 512.178000 um-hum

sw2221A-ms98-a-0098 526.165625 532.249125 [silence]
sw2221A-ms98-a-0099 532.249125 538.498875 yeah in some cases tha[t]- i[t]- it would work that way in some cases it would work the other way
sw2221A-ms98-a-0100 538.498875 541.304750 [silence]
sw2221A-ms98-a-0101 541.304750 549.995000 the jury would would slam them and and i think that that the jury probably has more of a right to sentence than the judge all the time
sw2221A-ms98-a-0102 549.995000 556.478500 [silence]
sw2221A-ms98-a-0103 556.478500 557.994750 uh-huh
sw2221A-ms98-a-0104 557.994750 559.203500 [silence]
sw2221A-ms98-a-0105 559.203500 562.718750 yeah i think that's probably a much fairer way
sw2221A-ms98-a-0106 562.718750 564.314375 [silence]
sw2221A-ms98-a-0107 564.314375 567.207250 [laughter]

sw2221A-ms98-a-0111 578.485375 580.485500 yeah
sw2221A-ms98-a-0112 580.485500 588.452375 it might be more it m[ay]- would be more work for the jury but it would be a more responsible way to deal with it
sw2221A-ms98-a-0113 588.452375 591.484500 [silence]
sw2221A-ms98-a-0114 591.484500 599.809750 the thing that i- i don't really like i- i don't know if uh a lot of jury selection processes that i've seen have been a
