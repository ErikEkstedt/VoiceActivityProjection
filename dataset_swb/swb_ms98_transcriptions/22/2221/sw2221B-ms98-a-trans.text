sw2221B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 9.754375 [noise]
sw2221B-ms98-a-0002 9.754375 15.962000 well you know they tell you that you get tried by a jury of your peers
sw2221B-ms98-a-0003 15.962000 20.419750 but you know it's pretty hard to try let's say
sw2221B-ms98-a-0004 20.419750 25.326625 the man down the street that's living on Social Security or somebody that's on a limited income
sw2221B-ms98-a-0005 25.326625 32.497875 to be tried by a jury of his peers if most of the people like the juries that i've served on are businessmen
sw2221B-ms98-a-0006 32.497875 37.996000 okay now they don't understand that you know maybe he needed fifty dollars so he held up the seven eleven
sw2221B-ms98-a-0007 37.996000 51.742500 okay they don't understand that because they have fifty dollars all the time so you know i think that it a trial by your peers should be exactly that someone in your own age bracket someone that you know you can't really do it 
sw2221B-ms98-a-0008 51.742500 65.019625 ethnically you know but you could do it you could probably get it a little closer but then there's another thing that i disagree with in Texas is sometimes you have a jury of six and sometimes you have a jury of twelve
sw2221B-ms98-a-0009 65.019625 70.301500 and i don't know why they do that do you have any reason do you know of any reason why they do that
sw2221B-ms98-a-0010 70.301500 76.987625 [silence]
sw2221B-ms98-a-0011 76.987625 78.678625 okay i see
sw2221B-ms98-a-0012 78.678625 82.670000 [silence]
sw2221B-ms98-a-0013 82.670000 83.733750 okay
sw2221B-ms98-a-0014 83.733750 95.967375 i don't know much about the Grand Jury how do you feel about the in Texas i noticed since i've been here in twelve years that they they break up the the trial and then the sentencing part of the trial
sw2221B-ms98-a-0015 95.967375 101.978375 [silence]
sw2221B-ms98-a-0016 101.978375 105.181000 well we know there's a few out there
sw2221B-ms98-a-0017 105.181000 122.986500 [silence]
sw2221B-ms98-a-0018 122.986500 125.476000 um-hum
sw2221B-ms98-a-0019 125.476000 126.990875 [silence]
sw2221B-ms98-a-0020 126.990875 129.283750 yeah it's
sw2221B-ms98-a-0021 129.283750 134.988750 yeah would be pretty hard well i don't think you know i don't think that
sw2221B-ms98-a-0022 134.988750 144.478625 if i was the criminal that i would like the judge passing sentence on me if the jury found me guilty then they should be able to decide at the same time what my punishment should be
sw2221B-ms98-a-0023 144.478625 152.197750 and i think it's not only that it's a waste of our money we have to have a trial for this person then two weeks down the road we have to sente[nce]- sentence
sw2221B-ms98-a-0024 152.197750 159.198875 excuse me set a sentencing date so now we're back in court again and that's more money spent
sw2221B-ms98-a-0025 159.198875 165.336125 [silence]
sw2221B-ms98-a-0026 165.336125 167.452625 no
sw2221B-ms98-a-0027 167.452625 180.736500 [silence]
sw2221B-ms98-a-0028 180.736500 183.489250 and it's not working either
sw2221B-ms98-a-0029 183.489250 194.719375 it seems that we have more and more repeat offenders i know i don't know how you all are there where you're at but where we're at now our jails are overcrowded we just built a brand new one two years ago
sw2221B-ms98-a-0030 194.719375 197.492750 and it's overcrowded
sw2221B-ms98-a-0031 197.492750 200.329750 so now they start turning them loose
sw2221B-ms98-a-0032 200.329750 210.975500 [silence]
sw2221B-ms98-a-0033 210.975500 213.487500 they turn them loose
sw2221B-ms98-a-0034 213.487500 216.280500 [silence]
sw2221B-ms98-a-0035 216.280500 217.748375 yeah
sw2221B-ms98-a-0036 217.748375 221.323250 [silence]
sw2221B-ms98-a-0037 221.323250 224.989750 well the way i[t]- it seems the way it's been working here's
sw2221B-ms98-a-0038 224.989750 226.485875 go ahead
sw2221B-ms98-a-0039 226.485875 234.289625 it seems the way it's been working here is they let those out that have spent two or three years out of their five to twenty sentence or five to life
sw2221B-ms98-a-0040 234.289625 239.292500 [silence]
sw2221B-ms98-a-0041 239.292500 241.471000 yeah they [vocalized-noise]
sw2221B-ms98-a-0042 241.471000 242.767625 [silence]
sw2221B-ms98-a-0043 242.767625 244.809625 yeah and they
sw2221B-ms98-a-0044 244.809625 245.997875 they keep
sw2221B-ms98-a-0045 245.997875 263.473125 [silence]
sw2221B-ms98-a-0046 263.473125 265.192750 yeah
sw2221B-ms98-a-0047 265.192750 270.296625 [silence]
sw2221B-ms98-a-0048 270.296625 272.011000 all right
sw2221B-ms98-a-0049 272.011000 285.994000 [silence]
sw2221B-ms98-a-0050 285.994000 287.961750 all right
sw2221B-ms98-a-0051 287.961750 296.209750 [silence]
sw2221B-ms98-a-0052 296.209750 298.498250 yeah it would allow th[e]-
sw2221B-ms98-a-0053 298.498250 302.734500 [silence]
sw2221B-ms98-a-0054 302.734500 306.267125 yeah instead of being completely penned up
sw2221B-ms98-a-0055 306.267125 307.296375 [silence]
sw2221B-ms98-a-0056 307.296375 315.765875 and that way it would give you know the probation department and parole department they've got to be overloaded with as many criminals as we have here in in Lubbock
sw2221B-ms98-a-0057 315.765875 323.677000 and that would give you know at least they don't have to drive all over town trying to find one guy or trying to see six or seven people
sw2221B-ms98-a-0058 323.677000 326.998875 [silence]
sw2221B-ms98-a-0059 326.998875 329.699625 sometimes it's pretty messed up isn't it
sw2221B-ms98-a-0060 329.699625 333.993875 [silence]
sw2221B-ms98-a-0061 333.993875 334.999750 um-hum
sw2221B-ms98-a-0062 334.999750 349.727625 [silence]
sw2221B-ms98-a-0063 349.727625 351.202750 yeah
sw2221B-ms98-a-0064 351.202750 352.293000 [silence]
sw2221B-ms98-a-0065 352.293000 361.478750 [noise] well see and there's another thing about the justice system that i don't like and there's a lot of people that tell me that that maybe my thoughts are wrong i came from California
sw2221B-ms98-a-0066 361.478750 370.291375 and when you're in jail they take you out just like they do in Alabama or anywhere else in what they call a chain gang and they clean the city parks
sw2221B-ms98-a-0067 370.291375 376.625500 and they clean the city streets but you know we have criminals in jail that do nothing but sit on their duff all day
sw2221B-ms98-a-0068 376.625500 388.973000 and here it costs us seventeen to eighteen thousand dollars a year to support a prisoner and i know yeah but i know families myself that have three and four children in Lubbock that don't make that much
sw2221B-ms98-a-0069 388.973000 393.490250 and they're not you know they're not doing anything to support themselves while they're there
sw2221B-ms98-a-0070 393.490250 397.749375 [silence]
sw2221B-ms98-a-0071 397.749375 398.993750 yeah
sw2221B-ms98-a-0072 398.993750 400.761875 [silence]
sw2221B-ms98-a-0073 400.761875 401.986000 yeah
sw2221B-ms98-a-0074 401.986000 408.793250 [silence]
sw2221B-ms98-a-0075 408.793250 410.494000 yeah
sw2221B-ms98-a-0076 410.494000 419.485375 [silence]
sw2221B-ms98-a-0077 419.485375 421.254000 yeah well
sw2221B-ms98-a-0078 421.254000 424.992000 [silence]
sw2221B-ms98-a-0079 424.992000 428.457125 um-hum see now i also believe in
sw2221B-ms98-a-0080 428.457125 432.807250 [silence]
sw2221B-ms98-a-0081 432.807250 434.485000 yeah
sw2221B-ms98-a-0082 434.485000 444.665000 [silence]
sw2221B-ms98-a-0083 444.665000 446.472250 yeah to help
sw2221B-ms98-a-0084 446.472250 449.483125 [silence]
sw2221B-ms98-a-0085 449.483125 454.301250 yeah but at least they would at least that way they would be helping pay for their own
sw2221B-ms98-a-0086 454.301250 456.325500 and something else that i would
sw2221B-ms98-a-0087 456.325500 457.982000 [silence]
sw2221B-ms98-a-0088 457.982000 463.488500 and something else that i would like to see is is uh victim reimbursement
sw2221B-ms98-a-0089 463.488500 478.472375 you know because they you know like you say these guys are in jail and they're working they're getting paid but the guy that they messed over to get there or they stole something from or beat to death or has nothing you know our our victims are victimized period and the law has no
sw2221B-ms98-a-0090 478.472375 480.416125 no uh
sw2221B-ms98-a-0091 480.416125 493.307125 regulations to deal with that they they know how to deal with the penal system and they know how to deal with the criminal but they don't know how to deal with the victim because we as citizens i guess haven't laid anything up there for them to deal with on that aspect
sw2221B-ms98-a-0092 493.307125 494.998750 [silence]
sw2221B-ms98-a-0093 494.998750 496.484000 but it's
sw2221B-ms98-a-0094 496.484000 504.269750 but i sure don't i- i strongly disagree with any judge passing sentence on a person himself there that
sw2221B-ms98-a-0095 504.269750 506.499750 [silence]
sw2221B-ms98-a-0096 506.499750 516.791375 yeah beca[use]- well th[e]- see the jury is dealing with the seriousness of the crime the jury gets to see the whole trial as does the judge but you know if if they figure there's
sw2221B-ms98-a-0097 516.791375 528.487625 maybe litigating circumstances or something like that whereas maybe the judge d[oes]- just doesn't care you committed this crime so i'm just going to throw the book at you whereas the jury may have a little
sw2221B-ms98-a-0098 528.487625 535.318250 shall we say sympathy you know he did this but you know why did he do this is there is there a basis for it
sw2221B-ms98-a-0099 535.318250 536.997500 [silence]
sw2221B-ms98-a-0100 536.997500 542.011875 yeah in some cases where the judge says okay i'll give you you know two to three years and then
sw2221B-ms98-a-0101 542.011875 543.390000 [silence]
sw2221B-ms98-a-0102 543.390000 544.744625 yeah
sw2221B-ms98-a-0103 544.744625 547.496625 [silence]
sw2221B-ms98-a-0104 547.496625 559.998250 well they have a stronger debate too because there's twelve people there they have to decide whether or not he's guilty and then they can sit in th[e]- at the same time and decide what his punishment would be and you'd have more than one person's input on it
sw2221B-ms98-a-0105 559.998250 561.245375 [silence]
sw2221B-ms98-a-0106 561.245375 569.749750 and you know we're supposed to be and i quote in a democratic society so you know if you can find me guilty then you ought to be able to pass sentence
sw2221B-ms98-a-0107 569.749750 578.230375 and a lot of jurors not that i know of but you know a lot of jurors may just sit there and say yeah he's guilty but i don't have to deal with it from here
sw2221B-ms98-a-0108 578.230375 581.995125 you know so the judge takes care of all of that
sw2221B-ms98-a-0109 581.995125 585.490000 [silence]
sw2221B-ms98-a-0110 585.490000 593.827000 yeah it would uh s[erving]- yeah serving on the jury would be definitely more respo[nsible]- you'd have to be a definitely more responsible person
sw2221B-ms98-a-0111 593.827000 599.809750 [silence]
