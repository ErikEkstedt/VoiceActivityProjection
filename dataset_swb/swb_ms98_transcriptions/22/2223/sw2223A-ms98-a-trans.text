sw2223A-ms98-a-0002 0.425750 4.142875 okay the topic that we have Victoria again as I mentioned was
sw2223A-ms98-a-0003 4.142875 8.290750 what do you feel is wrong with our public school system and i guess
sw2223A-ms98-a-0004 8.290750 15.531000 if i were to look at with four grown children and having been th[rough]- all four of them through public schools and colleges
sw2223A-ms98-a-0005 15.531000 19.141375 i guess the public school system i would have to say is that
sw2223A-ms98-a-0006 19.141375 22.829750 we probably need to pay our teachers a little bit more
sw2223A-ms98-a-0007 22.829750 27.275375 we need to we need to probably
sw2223A-ms98-a-0008 27.275375 33.444000 try to get more one on one with the teachers and the and the students if we could
sw2223A-ms98-a-0009 33.444000 47.614250 and the other thing was we need to really really to tighten up our discipline in schools because they run here in New England i'm not sure about the rest of the country but i know the schools are almost running rampant up here
sw2223A-ms98-a-0010 47.614250 55.077750 and it's too bad because there are you know serious drinking problems with with real
sw2223A-ms98-a-0011 55.077750 60.952250 um you know young young kids i'm talking kids that are nine ten eleven twelve years old
sw2223A-ms98-a-0012 60.952250 62.773750 drug problems
sw2223A-ms98-a-0013 62.773750 65.888250 [vocalized-noise] go ahead i'm sorry
sw2223A-ms98-a-0014 65.888250 82.856625 [silence]
sw2223A-ms98-a-0015 82.856625 83.982375 uh-huh
sw2223A-ms98-a-0016 83.982375 99.310125 [silence]
sw2223A-ms98-a-0017 99.310125 105.924875 yeah i lived i lived that's just outside of Washington i lived in Fairfax county that was really really a nice nice area down there and
sw2223A-ms98-a-0018 105.924875 112.331375 my i had the same situation here my kids were we bought them_1 up and put them in the public schools here in Rhode Island and
sw2223A-ms98-a-0019 112.331375 116.864125 they were not not too too bad and this was going back like ten years i guess
sw2223A-ms98-a-0020 116.864125 119.883250 ten years ago they were not too too bad at that time
sw2223A-ms98-a-0021 119.883250 125.069375 and i was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to move from Rhode Island to Texas with with TI with my job
sw2223A-ms98-a-0022 125.069375 138.405625 and i worked there in the southwest for ten almost ten or eleven years and the kids got a my kids got a much better ed[ucation]- education in Texas simply because they had the opportunity to have more one on one
sw2223A-ms98-a-0023 138.405625 150.919625 uh relationships with the with the uh the facility okay and and that helped like especially one of my sons he was he could learn but he really had to work at learning if if that makes sense to you
sw2223A-ms98-a-0024 150.919625 157.934125 and and uh again like you say there was and you are still a student and there's so much more you could have learned and
sw2223A-ms98-a-0025 157.934125 164.495500 but i i i don't know i think discipline i guess if i were to look at one thing we've lost
sw2223A-ms98-a-0026 164.495500 177.340250 well kids used to have a respect for the teacher i guess at one time but i think we've kind of lost that in out school system and i'm not really sure how to get it back i say discipline and that might be the wrong choice of words but it
sw2223A-ms98-a-0027 177.340250 192.187625 [silence]
sw2223A-ms98-a-0028 192.187625 203.569625 oh yeah it's so it it's so hard and and it's so hard to compete and and that's not one of the things that's gonna make the people like yourself who are just graduating from colleges you know or out across the country
sw2223A-ms98-a-0029 203.569625 213.104875 wanna go jumping into a an education field when the [laughter-when] there's you can almost double your pay in almost any other field you know for as a as a entry level
sw2223A-ms98-a-0030 213.104875 218.280875 and i am not saying that we should give them the world either but I think we should pay them a little more money
sw2223A-ms98-a-0031 218.280875 225.115500 um they say a hundred and eighty days a year is all they work and i don't really believe that i think it's a lot more than that
sw2223A-ms98-a-0032 225.115500 234.948125 when you figure the hours and time they put into the school and stuff alright and even if is only a hundred and eighty days a year lets pay them for the hundred and eighty days a year i mean [vocalized-noise]
sw2223A-ms98-a-0033 234.948125 236.728375 [silence]
sw2223A-ms98-a-0034 236.728375 243.466750 no no they [vocalized-noise] that's what i mean at one time we we used to able to carry that over to the kids of course i
sw2223A-ms98-a-0035 243.466750 254.714625 i can see the teacher's point too where at at three o'clock or four o'clock they want to go home and not worry about kids so but if they had probably some renumeration to help them say you know maybe i'll give this kid a little extra help or something
sw2223A-ms98-a-0036 254.714625 258.419625 in the long run i think it would really be worth while 
sw2223A-ms98-a-0037 258.419625 264.252000 [silence]
sw2223A-ms98-a-0038 264.252000 274.305625 what what is your major in school that your ah super that sounds good and you're finishing up this year huh

sw2223A-ms98-a-0040 284.692875 299.188250 most of the folk i've talked to are are industrial people th[at]- like my self that have been in the work work force for a number of years and and it's ah it's refreshing to talk to ah to some of you younger folks and get your ideas and thing you know and see how you feel about things
sw2223A-ms98-a-0041 299.188250 306.487000 well i don't know what else we can do about this school situation Victoria and if there's anything else you'd like to add
