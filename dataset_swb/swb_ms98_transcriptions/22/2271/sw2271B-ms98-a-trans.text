sw2271B-ms98-a-0008 29.676125 35.241125 well i i thought so too they they just had a letdown in the second half and they couldn't recover
sw2271B-ms98-a-0009 35.241125 37.292000 [silence]
sw2271B-ms98-a-0010 37.292000 42.240000 well U[NLV]- they say UNLV may be the greatest amateur team ever
sw2271B-ms98-a-0011 42.240000 46.370125 [silence]
sw2271B-ms98-a-0012 46.370125 51.217875 yeah big time i i'll bet they could hold their own in the NBA
sw2271B-ms98-a-0013 51.217875 53.041750 seriously
sw2271B-ms98-a-0014 53.041750 55.570250 i i bet there're some teams they could beat
sw2271B-ms98-a-0015 55.570250 57.191625 [silence]
sw2271B-ms98-a-0016 57.191625 58.999125 ye[ah]- possibly
sw2271B-ms98-a-0017 58.999125 61.700625 [silence]
sw2271B-ms98-a-0018 61.700625 65.059625 yeah actually i'm kind of a Lakers fan myself

sw2271B-ms98-a-0022 76.851500 82.738250 yeah yeah he's good coming off the bench now of course the oth[er]- they got Sam Perkins
sw2271B-ms98-a-0023 82.738250 84.667750 and that that helps
sw2271B-ms98-a-0024 84.667750 88.286750 [silence]
sw2271B-ms98-a-0025 88.286750 92.454000 oh okay well you remember Sam Perkins when he was in North Carolina don't you
sw2271B-ms98-a-0026 92.454000 97.239750 see he was a teammate with James Worthy and Michael Jordan
sw2271B-ms98-a-0027 97.239750 106.703375 the the three of those guys were [noise] the three pillars of the national championship team North Carolina had back in eighty two i think when Jordan was just a freshman
sw2271B-ms98-a-0028 106.703375 108.131125 [silence]
sw2271B-ms98-a-0029 108.131125 113.714125 yeah in fact uh Jordan hit the winning basket to win by one point
sw2271B-ms98-a-0030 113.714125 116.536875 with like sixteen seconds to go
sw2271B-ms98-a-0031 116.536875 123.009500 the[y]- they gave him the ball he took the shot if he makes it he's a hero if he misses it he's a goat he made it
sw2271B-ms98-a-0032 123.009500 126.873125 [silence]
sw2271B-ms98-a-0033 126.873125 128.125250 yep
sw2271B-ms98-a-0034 128.125250 135.061375 [silence]
sw2271B-ms98-a-0035 135.061375 145.037875 well i really don't think a[nybody]- anybody can beat UNLV they they might beat themselves but i don't know they're at such a high level of intensity
sw2271B-ms98-a-0036 145.037875 154.795250 th[ey]- they would have to have a really off day and somebody else would have to have a really on day and if that if both of those happened at the same time
sw2271B-ms98-a-0037 154.795250 156.947750 you might have an upset
sw2271B-ms98-a-0038 156.947750 160.122375 [silence]
sw2271B-ms98-a-0039 160.122375 163.643000 [noise] yep yep they're absolutely relentless
sw2271B-ms98-a-0040 163.643000 165.443750 [silence]
sw2271B-ms98-a-0041 165.443750 172.834250 [noise] well they're so close to an un[defeated]- undefeated season they can taste it and they wanna make history so i don't think they're gonna lack for motivation
sw2271B-ms98-a-0042 172.834250 177.349625 [silence]
sw2271B-ms98-a-0043 177.349625 182.511125 [noise] well i mean it's it's no disgrace to lose in the final four
sw2271B-ms98-a-0044 182.511125 187.387375 [silence]
sw2271B-ms98-a-0045 187.387375 201.097750 well UNLV's kind of in a different league from everybody else it it's kind of similar to back when UCLA was winning seven titles in a row from sixty seven to seventy three back then they they called the in[vitational]-
sw2271B-ms98-a-0046 201.097750 204.703250 well with him yeah and with Bill Walton [noise]
sw2271B-ms98-a-0047 204.703250 208.772875 and they used to call it the uh the UCLA invitational
sw2271B-ms98-a-0048 208.772875 212.614000 because_1 they figured everybody else is just coming to just to be there
sw2271B-ms98-a-0049 212.614000 217.202250 [silence]
sw2271B-ms98-a-0050 217.202250 222.320500 yeah i- i don't know that any one team's gonna be able to dominate for that many years in a row
sw2271B-ms98-a-0051 222.320500 223.485750 [silence]
sw2271B-ms98-a-0052 223.485750 230.580125 uh partly because the really outs[tanding]- many of the really outstanding players leave college before they turn seniors
sw2271B-ms98-a-0053 230.580125 237.548375 so you don't ye[ah]- yeah so you don't really get to keep the the nucleus of your best talent for the whole four years
sw2271B-ms98-a-0054 237.548375 241.002875 [silence]
sw2271B-ms98-a-0055 241.002875 244.372250 well this has been fun i've enjoyed talking with you
