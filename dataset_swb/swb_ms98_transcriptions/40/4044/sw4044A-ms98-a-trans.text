sw4044A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.271375 [noise]
sw4044A-ms98-a-0002 0.271375 3.364500 i guess my basic feeling is that
sw4044A-ms98-a-0003 3.364500 15.437000 as a middle income tax payer i'm not paying too much if i'm sure that i'm getting value for the dollar i mean that i guess sounds like a cliche but
sw4044A-ms98-a-0004 15.437000 25.354125 uh looking around at a a lot of the infrastructure particularly in the northeast here uh you know bridges and roads in terrible shape and
sw4044A-ms98-a-0005 25.354125 26.368250 [silence]
sw4044A-ms98-a-0006 26.368250 29.487125 i don't know [laughter] i'm sort of overwhelmed by it all
sw4044A-ms98-a-0007 29.487125 67.940125 [silence]
sw4044A-ms98-a-0008 67.940125 69.324500 [laughter]
sw4044A-ms98-a-0009 69.324500 70.344375 [silence]
sw4044A-ms98-a-0010 70.344375 74.824500 yeah it's entirely possible certainly anything that's been
sw4044A-ms98-a-0011 74.824500 85.700000 discussed over the the last dozen years or so or maybe even longer in terms of of tax reform or or revenue reallocation
sw4044A-ms98-a-0012 85.700000 96.186750 seems to be concerned with just that you know who's who's gonna start getting more and how fast um i kind of came of age in the
sw4044A-ms98-a-0013 96.186750 102.620375 sixties and it seemed to me seems to me that the the general attitude in the
sw4044A-ms98-a-0014 102.620375 112.377750 entire country is a lot different then than now i mean i think there was more a a general sense of prosperity [vocalized-noise]
sw4044A-ms98-a-0015 112.377750 114.180875 yeah although
sw4044A-ms98-a-0016 114.180875 115.392750 my
sw4044A-ms98-a-0017 115.392750 116.950375 oh excuse me
sw4044A-ms98-a-0018 116.950375 122.509000 [silence]
sw4044A-ms98-a-0019 122.509000 133.187750 yeah i i've never been able to reconcile that fact which which does seem to be true with the fact that the typical middle class family
sw4044A-ms98-a-0020 133.187750 141.947500 today seems to have you know and expect some what more in terms of material possessions and vacations and what not
sw4044A-ms98-a-0021 141.947500 151.859250 but back then uh i think there is more of a sense of because there was a feeling of prosperity people did not mind paying for social programs
sw4044A-ms98-a-0022 151.859250 155.450250 for instance or public improvements and today there
sw4044A-ms98-a-0023 155.450250 161.346375 there seems to be a sort of a jealous guarding of resources by each generation

sw4044A-ms98-a-0028 202.803000 220.980375 [silence]
sw4044A-ms98-a-0029 220.980375 228.898375 yeah pretty much i mean i i paid whatever something on the order of four thousand dollars a year for
sw4044A-ms98-a-0030 228.898375 236.959750 tuition and room and board and comprehensive fee and uh for those those figures have been dwarfed today certainly
sw4044A-ms98-a-0031 236.959750 244.463125 [silence]
sw4044A-ms98-a-0032 244.463125 245.487000 yeah
