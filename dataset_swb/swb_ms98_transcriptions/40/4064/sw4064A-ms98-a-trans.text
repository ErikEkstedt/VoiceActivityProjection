sw4064A-ms98-a-0002 0.105500 2.306375 well how do you feel about trial by jury
sw4064A-ms98-a-0003 2.306375 6.717500 [silence]
sw4064A-ms98-a-0004 6.717500 8.237125 in what way

sw4064A-ms98-a-0006 18.607250 20.464250 [laughter]
sw4064A-ms98-a-0007 20.464250 27.469750 [laughter] i mean do you do you feel they're they're swayed more to[ward]- are you talking about with criminal or civil suits
sw4064A-ms98-a-0008 27.469750 28.746625 [silence]
sw4064A-ms98-a-0009 28.746625 34.704625 um-hum so you think that i mean that the stereotypical bleeding heart juries where they feel sorry
sw4064A-ms98-a-0010 34.704625 45.486500 [silence]
sw4064A-ms98-a-0011 45.486500 47.504625 um-hum
sw4064A-ms98-a-0012 47.504625 53.960500 the other thing the other thing that really bothers me about that is i think you know that a judge can be
sw4064A-ms98-a-0013 53.960500 59.513250 uh i like the idea of juries uh of your peers um in that
sw4064A-ms98-a-0014 59.513250 69.788250 you you you you you get more first of all you get more than one person making the de[cision]- making a decision and second of all you get a wide variety of background so that
sw4064A-ms98-a-0015 69.788250 73.491750 [silence]
sw4064A-ms98-a-0016 73.491750 74.938750 um-hum
sw4064A-ms98-a-0017 74.938750 77.905125 i'd agree that that's that's definitely a problem

sw4064A-ms98-a-0030 136.208750 138.101125 yeah i
sw4064A-ms98-a-0031 138.101125 147.487875 i guess i- i- definitely agree with you but sen[tencing]- the well what i don't like about uh sen[tencing]- juries doing the sentencing in that
sw4064A-ms98-a-0032 147.487875 154.862125 i think it becomes a lot less th[e]- th[e]- the the same crime gets unequal sentences
sw4064A-ms98-a-0033 154.862125 164.222875 i uh i- i think there is more of an ability of you know you know s[electing]- s[electing]- selecting a jury two two different juries that would
sw4064A-ms98-a-0034 164.222875 170.098750 most of the time come up with the same idea [vocalized-noise] the same idea versus you know whether he is guilty or innocent
sw4064A-ms98-a-0035 170.098750 171.087375 but
sw4064A-ms98-a-0036 171.087375 174.506500 i think i think that there'd that there'd be a large variation in
sw4064A-ms98-a-0037 174.506500 176.246125 in trying to
sw4064A-ms98-a-0038 176.246125 182.042000 gauge the the severity of the crime and an appropriate punishment and and have that
sw4064A-ms98-a-0039 182.042000 185.119750 that measure stick across the board

sw4064A-ms98-a-0046 203.542250 209.680625 of course a lot of that's also the the ability of of the defendant to uh get a good lawyer [laughter]

sw4064A-ms98-a-0060 257.545875 260.183125 through argument that the

sw4064A-ms98-a-0069 288.297750 298.562000 yeah this is a little bit of the subject but one one thing that i that i really dislike uh also that's that's new is the uh is that i have heard that there are federal sentences
