sw4064B-ms98-a-0002 1.675875 7.422875 i feel very uncomfortable with trials by juries recently uh
sw4064B-ms98-a-0003 7.422875 15.083500 in that it seems to me they're swayed more by emotion than uh by evidence that's presented
sw4064B-ms98-a-0004 15.083500 19.061625 i have uh very little regard for the law
sw4064B-ms98-a-0005 19.061625 22.649125 [laughter] that's presently practiced [laughter]
sw4064B-ms98-a-0006 22.649125 26.067500 [silence]
sw4064B-ms98-a-0007 26.067500 29.474500 i was thinking primarily criminal cases
sw4064B-ms98-a-0008 29.474500 32.497500 [silence]
sw4064B-ms98-a-0009 32.497500 33.892125 yes
sw4064B-ms98-a-0010 33.892125 38.520125 um-hum that's a concern of mine uh
sw4064B-ms98-a-0011 38.520125 46.335875 i would feel more comfortable in many cases i think with judges uh you know doing the sentencing
sw4064B-ms98-a-0012 46.335875 56.978375 [silence]
sw4064B-ms98-a-0013 56.978375 58.476625 um-hum
sw4064B-ms98-a-0014 58.476625 70.358750 [silence]
sw4064B-ms98-a-0015 70.358750 74.512125 yeah my question i guess is are they really your peers
sw4064B-ms98-a-0016 74.512125 76.086625 uh
sw4064B-ms98-a-0017 76.086625 77.359750 [silence]
sw4064B-ms98-a-0018 77.359750 84.654375 uh too often i think they're not and uh when you y[ou]- when you are
sw4064B-ms98-a-0019 84.654375 94.278875 selecting a jury and you're doing it partially if if not entirely on the basis of which color representation you have
sw4064B-ms98-a-0020 94.278875 104.152875 you know that's a matter of concern to me too uh i think that uh in such cases uh
sw4064B-ms98-a-0021 104.152875 110.441875 they're not really looking for unbiased people but rather for biased
sw4064B-ms98-a-0022 110.441875 120.279625 uh now i happen to know several judges and there's one that i'd feel uncomfortable but has [vocalized-noise] doing sentencing without the jury [laughter]
sw4064B-ms98-a-0023 120.279625 121.234500 [laughter]
sw4064B-ms98-a-0024 121.234500 129.285750 [noise] i'd feel a little bit uneasy about but the other two i feel uh would give either
sw4064B-ms98-a-0025 129.285750 134.993000 you know the the plaintiff or the defendant uh the th[e]- the full benefit of the law 
sw4064B-ms98-a-0026 134.993000 137.933500 and i guess that's what i am concerned with
sw4064B-ms98-a-0027 137.933500 145.595875 [silence]
sw4064B-ms98-a-0028 145.595875 147.149875 um-hum
sw4064B-ms98-a-0029 147.149875 154.059750 [silence]
sw4064B-ms98-a-0030 154.059750 156.075500 this is very true
sw4064B-ms98-a-0031 156.075500 168.226250 [silence]
sw4064B-ms98-a-0032 168.226250 170.800000 um-hum um-hum
sw4064B-ms98-a-0033 170.800000 184.595500 [silence]
sw4064B-ms98-a-0034 184.595500 194.424125 yeah and you do see such un[even]- uneven sentencing uh you know evidence of it in the newspapers and such i mean
sw4064B-ms98-a-0035 194.424125 202.814375 where uh it would appear that the crimes were very similar but one individual got twenty five years and the other one was sentenced to life for some[thing]-
sw4064B-ms98-a-0036 202.814375 204.568625 uh
sw4064B-ms98-a-0037 204.568625 208.924000 [silence]
sw4064B-ms98-a-0038 208.924000 211.316750 isn't that the truth [laughter]
sw4064B-ms98-a-0039 211.316750 214.655500 [noise] there are times when is it uh
sw4064B-ms98-a-0040 214.655500 219.192125 oh goodness my mind's gone blank it uh Othello
sw4064B-ms98-a-0041 219.192125 225.788250 you know where he says kill all the [laughter-lawyers] [laughter] every now and then one is tempted to feel that way
sw4064B-ms98-a-0042 225.788250 237.642125 [laughter] but i it's taken me a long time to understand that uh lawyers are concerned with the law and not with justice as we think of
sw4064B-ms98-a-0043 237.642125 244.332125 you know am[ateur]- as novices tend to think that uh attorneys care about justice
sw4064B-ms98-a-0044 244.332125 251.445500 [silence]
sw4064B-ms98-a-0045 251.445500 252.900375 um-hum
sw4064B-ms98-a-0046 252.900375 258.373750 [silence]
sw4064B-ms98-a-0047 258.373750 272.706125 and they're very effective too uh even i've been involved [vocalized-noise] sl[ightly]- slightly in a case where i know the person is guilty but uh his attorneys gotten him off
sw4064B-ms98-a-0048 272.706125 283.057625 uh the city has dropped their charges against him because their the attorney has presented enough evidence of doubt to convince the judge
sw4064B-ms98-a-0049 283.057625 287.132625 so i don't know [laughter] [vocalized-noise]
