sw4062A-ms98-a-0009 17.137875 29.901250 right okay so so i will just assume that we are being recorded now i thought that they had a confirmation message when that occurred but perhaps not uh anyway i did press let me press one once again
sw4062A-ms98-a-0010 29.901250 31.627500 [noise]
sw4062A-ms98-a-0011 31.627500 40.262125 well i'll i'll take it that that did it okay so um the answer to that well maybe i should answer the question first since i have had so long to think about it um
sw4062A-ms98-a-0012 40.262125 48.882250 i uh use a uh a program on my Macintosh which is called Dollars and Cents actually it hails from the bay area where you're from and uh
sw4062A-ms98-a-0013 48.882250 51.205250 [silence]
sw4062A-ms98-a-0014 51.205250 56.446875 oh Frisco Texas uh gee i don't even know [laughter]
sw4062A-ms98-a-0015 56.446875 58.451000 Raleigh North Carolina

sw4062A-ms98-a-0017 62.145125 63.816125 [noise]
sw4062A-ms98-a-0018 63.816125 68.260000 i see okay well anyway it doesn't hail from the area where you are
sw4062A-ms98-a-0019 68.260000 82.333750 uh but uh uh anyway uh so so anyway i use this a pe[rsonal]- personal accounting program on my Macintosh to keep track of expenses but it also has a budget feature but i don't find it very useful because it makes all kinds of assumptions that aren't
sw4062A-ms98-a-0020 82.333750 94.893375 the case in in my situation so i use the the little spread sheets for that i- i- i don't know actually i think most people who are in the series are a little bit familiar with computers but if you're not let me know and i will give you more explanation
sw4062A-ms98-a-0021 94.893375 97.737250 [silence]
sw4062A-ms98-a-0022 97.737250 102.031500 okay so have you do you do you use a computer to do your budgeting

sw4062A-ms98-a-0026 120.004000 132.037375 i found that it was uh y[ou]- well you have a lot more information if you use a computer because you just can't keep track of everything manually you'll never go back through the old slips and see what your electric bill was and so forth but
sw4062A-ms98-a-0027 132.037375 138.272000 if you if you can just print it out it gives you a lot better feel for how you stand compared to last year [noise]
sw4062A-ms98-a-0028 138.272000 139.332125 um
sw4062A-ms98-a-0029 139.332125 142.547625 [silence]
sw4062A-ms98-a-0030 142.547625 144.823125 for Macintosh yes
sw4062A-ms98-a-0031 144.823125 158.459750 um it's called Dollars and Cents and actually the leading program is Managing Your Monies by Andrew Tobias but i used that one year and it was so awful that i just gave up [laughter]
sw4062A-ms98-a-0032 158.459750 160.288750 excuse me
sw4062A-ms98-a-0033 160.288750 165.977125 it was well it would bring up a new screen for everything you know you you um
sw4062A-ms98-a-0034 165.977125 171.215250 you would make one [vocalized-noise] uh like for example if you were reconciling your check account and you wanted to 
sw4062A-ms98-a-0035 171.215250 185.833625 change a transaction let's say you wanted to add in interest or put in a fee or something it took about three screens to do that and you could only see the one transaction you were working on all the earlier transactions were hidden it was just it it you just
sw4062A-ms98-a-0036 185.833625 193.542125 yeah it had tunnel vision i mean it had a lot of features but they were all so hard to use that i [laughter-never] never really used any of them so
sw4062A-ms98-a-0037 193.542125 203.755625 uh i- i- i read since then though that they've redes[igned]- rede[signed]- uh redesigned the interface so probably it's a little better uh than it was before um
sw4062A-ms98-a-0038 203.755625 209.838250 [noise] so um do you do you do a uh a yearly budget or a monthly budget or

sw4062A-ms98-a-0047 248.644500 255.647375 uh yeah i try and uh i think that one of the things i've i've worked on is cutting down on the number of transactions
sw4062A-ms98-a-0048 255.647375 267.127250 uh so so i- i instead of paying bills monthly if they are not very much uh i just pay enough for two months when i pay one month's bill and that way i have to send you know substantially
sw4062A-ms98-a-0049 267.127250 270.834375 fewer number of things out in the mail which saves a lot of time
sw4062A-ms98-a-0050 270.834375 271.990750 and uh
sw4062A-ms98-a-0051 271.990750 275.923000 uh gee i pray my pay my cable TV annually
sw4062A-ms98-a-0052 275.923000 282.102125 you get a discount for doing that they give you the thirteenth month of month of service free if they remember [laughter]
sw4062A-ms98-a-0053 282.102125 291.684625 but they say [laughter] i- uh they always forget you [laughter] every year they mess it up and forget to give me credit or or or shall i say five out of the last six years
sw4062A-ms98-a-0054 291.684625 296.437125 so i called in and uh at first i got kind of upset but [laughter] [laughter-now]
sw4062A-ms98-a-0055 296.437125 299.522000 now yeah now i know they are going to do that um
