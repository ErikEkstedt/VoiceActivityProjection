sw4070B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 35.872625 [silence]
sw4070B-ms98-a-0002 35.872625 43.258125 well let's see uh yeah i think taxes are high but uh
sw4070B-ms98-a-0003 43.258125 48.761250 yeah maybe in some cases they're not high enough for instance uh
sw4070B-ms98-a-0004 48.761250 51.704250 here in my state uh
sw4070B-ms98-a-0005 51.704250 54.259125 [silence]
sw4070B-ms98-a-0006 54.259125 60.032875 yeah we do yeah but the but the reason the sales tax is high is because we don't have an income tax
sw4070B-ms98-a-0007 60.032875 72.245750 and uh you know we don't have an income tax because uh basically no[body]- nobody wants any new taxes but the upshot is that we can't properly fund uh education here
sw4070B-ms98-a-0008 72.245750 83.847875 yeah so like the amount that we spend on education here in uh in the state of Washington per uh per student
sw4070B-ms98-a-0009 83.847875 92.254000 is is actually in the in the lower percentile uh i mean is is is low it we're we're ranked fairly low
sw4070B-ms98-a-0010 92.254000 102.269500 uh per fifty states yet uh you know yet we expect a lot out of the schools you know we've got here in the Seattle area we've got a lot of uh
sw4070B-ms98-a-0011 102.269500 108.286625 uh high technology industries we've got Microsoft here well Microsoft expects well educated employees
sw4070B-ms98-a-0012 108.286625 113.327750 but uh you know Microsoft is only paying property taxes towards uh
sw4070B-ms98-a-0013 113.327750 122.501875 towards uh towards schools so and there are those that argue well they waste too much money in schools or those or there there's
sw4070B-ms98-a-0014 122.501875 127.947500 you know more money doesn't solve the problem but i feel like in public schools that they uh
sw4070B-ms98-a-0015 127.947500 133.049500 uh that they really don't fund it they they don't basically fund it very well
sw4070B-ms98-a-0016 133.049500 175.378875 [silence]
sw4070B-ms98-a-0017 175.378875 186.136125 well it's cheaper to to educate uh people who are in the top ten percent than it is to have to educate the handicapped and the developmentally disabled and all that stuff
sw4070B-ms98-a-0018 186.136125 229.305750 [silence]
sw4070B-ms98-a-0019 229.305750 240.065000 yeah that's i've i've been hearing that that's uh that that's been going down and uh i don't know what uh what all the reasons are for that
sw4070B-ms98-a-0020 240.065000 298.786000 [silence]
