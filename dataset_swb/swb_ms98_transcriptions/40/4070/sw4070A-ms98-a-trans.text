sw4070A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 3.008375 [noise] well i definitely think taxes are too high
sw4070A-ms98-a-0002 3.008375 11.194000 uh taxes at all levels uh state local and federal are over fifty percent of many people's uh income now
sw4070A-ms98-a-0003 11.194000 21.245625 and uh the amazing thing is to think that one of the primary reasons for the Boston Tea Party and the American Revolution was exorbitant taxes
sw4070A-ms98-a-0004 21.245625 29.825750 but for them exorbitant taxes were under ten percent it was ridi[culous]- you know uh that that uh we we took such drastic action over taxes
sw4070A-ms98-a-0005 29.825750 35.719250 uh and it's so much worse now but people are just apathetic about it and sit back and do nothing
sw4070A-ms98-a-0006 35.719250 51.763375 [silence]
sw4070A-ms98-a-0007 51.763375 55.141625 you have a real high sales tax there if i recall
sw4070A-ms98-a-0008 55.141625 59.527625 [silence]
sw4070A-ms98-a-0009 59.527625 60.173625 uh-huh
sw4070A-ms98-a-0010 60.173625 72.115000 [silence]
sw4070A-ms98-a-0011 72.115000 73.477625 oh really
sw4070A-ms98-a-0012 73.477625 75.523625 [silence]
sw4070A-ms98-a-0013 75.523625 77.492500 <b_aside> get out of my room <e_aside>
sw4070A-ms98-a-0014 77.492500 91.654750 [silence]
sw4070A-ms98-a-0015 91.654750 93.070125 interesting
sw4070A-ms98-a-0016 93.070125 107.454375 [silence]
sw4070A-ms98-a-0017 107.454375 108.815000 sure
sw4070A-ms98-a-0018 108.815000 131.784625 [silence]
sw4070A-ms98-a-0019 131.784625 141.678125 my my feeling about at least i I don't know if we want to get off the subject of taxes and on to the subject of schools but around here
sw4070A-ms98-a-0020 141.678125 146.103000 uh some of the public schools get more funds than
sw4070A-ms98-a-0021 146.103000 157.064125 the private schools uh in terms of you know the per student expenditure at say Carver High School in Atlanta is over eleven thousand dollars per student
sw4070A-ms98-a-0022 157.064125 159.413000 but the best private school
sw4070A-ms98-a-0023 159.413000 172.355375 is uh has a tuition of only seven thousand and all of their students of course rank consistently in the top ten percent on the SAT etcetera and the the public school that gets uh quite a bit more money 
sw4070A-ms98-a-0024 172.355375 177.665750 just doesn't uh doesn't turn out that quality of student and
sw4070A-ms98-a-0025 177.665750 180.828875 [silence]
sw4070A-ms98-a-0026 180.828875 181.835125 [laughter]
sw4070A-ms98-a-0027 181.835125 186.132250 [silence]
sw4070A-ms98-a-0028 186.132250 194.105875 yeah but i think a lot of it is just that uh the money is wasted on bureaucracy and it's not very efficient um
sw4070A-ms98-a-0029 194.105875 198.365375 uh we we have you know a state department of education and things which
sw4070A-ms98-a-0030 198.365375 209.315500 all all they do is do statistics and push paper around and none of the uh one of the things that's happened here is that uh the percentage of the money going to instruction
sw4070A-ms98-a-0031 209.315500 216.191375 meaning teacher's salaries and books and materials has been falling even though that the uh total funding has been going up
sw4070A-ms98-a-0032 216.191375 223.326750 uh so that uh you know whereas twenty years ago seventy percent of the money going to schools
sw4070A-ms98-a-0033 223.326750 231.759000 went to teacher's salaries and books and materials now it's only forty five percent and that's really scary to think that uh
sw4070A-ms98-a-0034 231.759000 239.294750 [silence]
sw4070A-ms98-a-0035 239.294750 244.362750 yeah i think that uh one of the reasons our taxes are so high is just that uh
sw4070A-ms98-a-0036 244.362750 253.445500 on on top of the inefficiencies like what i just described is the government tries to do too many things that the government has no business doing you know we're spending
sw4070A-ms98-a-0037 253.445500 261.447250 a couple a hundred billion dollars a year to maintain troops in Europe and Asia uh we have no business spending that money
sw4070A-ms98-a-0038 261.447250 270.272625 and uh we're spending over two hundred billion dollars a year on interest on the debt uh there was a Presidential candidate forum here
sw4070A-ms98-a-0039 270.272625 276.296000 last Saturday and ju[st]- we just had our primary in Georgia and uh
sw4070A-ms98-a-0040 276.296000 285.246875 uh you know i I one of the questions i asked the representative of Bob Carey who was there was uh
sw4070A-ms98-a-0041 285.246875 290.275875 and we have a projected four hundred billion dollar budget deficit this year
sw4070A-ms98-a-0042 290.275875 298.786000 what are you gonna do to to correct that and all he ta[lked]- and and all they could say all the is the only thing he would do is consolidate some cabi[net]-
