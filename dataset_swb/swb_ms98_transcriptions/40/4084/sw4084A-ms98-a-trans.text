sw4084A-ms98-a-0027 157.354125 172.119375 and they have reading to write which is uh they can write stories and and learn to write on computers so at least uh the school district that we're in has you know computers that they begin on and i really feel like
sw4084A-ms98-a-0028 172.119375 186.265250 um they're going to have to use those a lot and and that way a child that my son already know already knows how to read and he will be able to excel at his own pace where the kids that you know
sw4084A-ms98-a-0029 186.265250 187.544125 that don't have
sw4084A-ms98-a-0030 187.544125 194.791625 you know that haven't had the he has a real desire to learn and hopefully he will be challenged throughout
