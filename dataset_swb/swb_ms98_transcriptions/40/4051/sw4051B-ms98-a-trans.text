sw4051B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.609375 [noise]
sw4051B-ms98-a-0002 0.609375 11.073875 yeah i might as well uh one of the things i'm very concerned about the air pollution is the uh this this the ozone layer uh
sw4051B-ms98-a-0003 11.073875 20.317125 uh [vocalized-noise] uh issue uh i used to own a heating and air conditioning business and handled lots of fre[on]- different types of freons
sw4051B-ms98-a-0004 20.317125 29.465125 and it uh rather bothers me that uh i was in in effect uh contributing to the delinquency of the the environment so to speak
sw4051B-ms98-a-0005 29.465125 34.151500 [silence]
sw4051B-ms98-a-0006 34.151500 47.700375 right right and one of the reasons they fixed up the freons eleven twelve and thirteen in in in that area was because they were inexpensive uh they could be made uh you know che[ap]- inexpensive and lots of it
sw4051B-ms98-a-0007 47.700375 58.986625 uh and in that and its properties were great uh with uh the machinery didn't have to have lots of expensive machinery to uh get your heating and cooling cycles to work
sw4051B-ms98-a-0008 58.986625 60.980500 [silence]
sw4051B-ms98-a-0009 60.980500 62.303125 so
sw4051B-ms98-a-0010 62.303125 63.347750 [silence]
sw4051B-ms98-a-0011 63.347750 74.101250 well [vocalized-noise] course there's only a a [laughter] tremendous number of a refrigerators and fre[on]- excuse me refrigerators and freezers 
sw4051B-ms98-a-0012 74.101250 86.213625 both commercial and residential uh utilizing freon twelve and of course the the new cars i guess starting with ni[neteen]- nineteen ninety three will not have freon twelve in their systems
sw4051B-ms98-a-0013 86.213625 92.217250 but uh there's you know there's the ton of after market machines and et cetera et cetera
sw4051B-ms98-a-0014 92.217250 93.253875 [silence]
sw4051B-ms98-a-0015 93.253875 97.406875 and that's got me very con[cerned]- you know highly concerned that uh
sw4051B-ms98-a-0016 97.406875 98.808500 [noise]
sw4051B-ms98-a-0017 98.808500 101.306375 it's gonna be quite a while before we can uh
sw4051B-ms98-a-0018 101.306375 113.257625 undo this now that could spawn several good industries and help pull us out of this recession but you got to have people that can make you know earn a salary to pay for this conversion
sw4051B-ms98-a-0019 113.257625 125.023375 so we're so i see us in a kind somewhat of a catch twenty two unless we unless the banks or industry and or the government go together and and come up with a way to uh
sw4051B-ms98-a-0020 125.023375 138.840625 have us uh as a an un[employed]- the part of the unemployed society be able to be gainfully employed again converting all this freon twelve stuff into uh the new nonpolluting uh compound
sw4051B-ms98-a-0021 138.840625 139.998250 [silence]
sw4051B-ms98-a-0022 139.998250 148.098375 because as i say there is a there's a tremen[dous]- well how many uh uh families own a refrigerator
sw4051B-ms98-a-0023 148.098375 153.137750 and then do you know that number and then how many own a a freezer separate from
sw4051B-ms98-a-0024 153.137750 159.009875 and how many people especially here in Texas own cars and trucks with air conditioning
sw4051B-ms98-a-0025 159.009875 160.046125 [silence]
sw4051B-ms98-a-0026 160.046125 169.634750 i mean this is there there are people that that make it have a thriving business uh that do nothing but heating and air conditioning on on automobiles and trucks
sw4051B-ms98-a-0027 169.634750 184.453000 and uh the only reason i didn't uh get into that more when i was had my little business was because uh most of your uh air conditioning in in on vehicles tend to be greasy and dirty to the N-th degree
sw4051B-ms98-a-0028 184.453000 185.915750 and [laughter-i] [laughter-mean]
sw4051B-ms98-a-0029 185.915750 190.654125 so uh that's why i stayed in stayed more towar[ds]- towards uh
sw4051B-ms98-a-0030 190.654125 202.072000 uh and that's a pollu[ting]- polluting type deal too is the excessive um you know uh petroleum products in your engine bay and so forth and the dirt and grit and
sw4051B-ms98-a-0031 202.072000 208.098125 the those two mixed together with with water and uh [noise] really make a uh make a mess
sw4051B-ms98-a-0032 208.098125 217.260000 [silence]
sw4051B-ms98-a-0033 217.260000 218.719250 um-hum
sw4051B-ms98-a-0034 218.719250 221.281750 [silence]
sw4051B-ms98-a-0035 221.281750 222.247375 right
sw4051B-ms98-a-0036 222.247375 223.608000 well most
sw4051B-ms98-a-0037 223.608000 234.197125 most of the time when you see bus uh you know the buses with the diesel that's uh those are carbon particles and uh carbon dioxide and water vapor
sw4051B-ms98-a-0038 234.197125 243.177000 uh because when you when d[iesel]- diesel is burned it's it you know diesel fuel is burned in a in a in the diesel engine it's burned so completely
sw4051B-ms98-a-0039 243.177000 251.741500 that you don't have any uh uh nitrous oxides uh or oxides of nitrogen uh to uh form
sw4051B-ms98-a-0040 251.741500 257.385625 because of by virtue of the very combustion process of the diesel engine
sw4051B-ms98-a-0041 257.385625 260.106375 because_1 diesel oil is uh
sw4051B-ms98-a-0042 260.106375 262.232000 [laughter-is] [laughter-not] [laughter-very] volatile
sw4051B-ms98-a-0043 262.232000 263.233250 [silence]
sw4051B-ms98-a-0044 263.233250 268.619000 you know where gasoline if you leave a little pail of gasoline out before long it's gone
sw4051B-ms98-a-0045 268.619000 272.243000 diesel is going to be around because it doesn't evaporate easily
sw4051B-ms98-a-0046 272.243000 280.075125 and it's got uh you know it's it's latent heat is high but it's slow burning at at uh
sw4051B-ms98-a-0047 280.075125 286.366750 normal pressures that's why your diesel engines have such high compression ratios
sw4051B-ms98-a-0048 286.366750 295.511750 as the as the air is heated you know by virtue of the compression process to like one to nineteen or nineteen to one ratio
sw4051B-ms98-a-0049 295.511750 299.522000 and so if i[t]- the car sucks in uh fifty degrees
