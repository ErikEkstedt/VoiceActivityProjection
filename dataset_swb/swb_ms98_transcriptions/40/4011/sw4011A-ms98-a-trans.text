sw4011A-ms98-a-0015 65.643750 74.508750 i see um do you think that uh putting putting those people in jail permanently would be an equally good solution
sw4011A-ms98-a-0016 74.508750 82.716125 [silence]
sw4011A-ms98-a-0017 82.716125 83.993125 um-hum

sw4011A-ms98-a-0022 104.132875 118.525750 well certainly for for someone like Charles Manson who's very definitely going to stay in jail for the rest of his life i uh i- i can't imagine that he will ever be allowed out by the parole board that uh his life is not going to improve
sw4011A-ms98-a-0023 118.525750 131.216375 um do you think uh do you think that that uh the death penalty is effective as a means of retribution
sw4011A-ms98-a-0024 131.216375 134.611125 yeah as as as a deterrent value yeah
sw4011A-ms98-a-0025 134.611125 153.249375 [silence]
sw4011A-ms98-a-0026 153.249375 154.627375 um-hum

sw4011A-ms98-a-0028 162.827250 174.677000 um well [vocalized-noise] to be honest i think that the uh capital punishment is is is a uh red herring in the crime and punishment business 
sw4011A-ms98-a-0029 174.677000 180.721000 um as you said we're letting our people out far too much really the problem is
sw4011A-ms98-a-0030 180.721000 191.212250 that i- i think two fold number one in Los Angeles as you may know there's uh lots and lots of problem high crime areas and and uh [vocalized-noise]
sw4011A-ms98-a-0031 191.212250 199.875500 in black parts of town the cops the cops don't trust the the people who live there and the people don't live there tru[st]- uh people don't trust the cops who who uh
sw4011A-ms98-a-0032 199.875500 209.332750 run the beat [noise] so in this heated air of mistrust people don't do what's necessary
sw4011A-ms98-a-0033 209.332750 213.863625 to keep crime down because
sw4011A-ms98-a-0034 213.863625 225.496000 uh you know if if uh it takes too much work or if you're liable to get beaten just because you're black or whatever things are not going to change and so
sw4011A-ms98-a-0035 225.496000 233.929750 capital punishment doesn't matter if the criminals who are committing the crimes don't get caught in the first place
sw4011A-ms98-a-0036 233.929750 240.016750 [silence]
sw4011A-ms98-a-0037 240.016750 242.799625 oh yeah as as uh

sw4011A-ms98-a-0041 251.416875 265.070500 yeah exactly you know John John Singleton who's who uh made the film um [noise] Boys in the Hood noted that uh one in twenty five black men will be killed at the hands of other black men
sw4011A-ms98-a-0042 265.070500 278.431500 and uh that's you know for them the death penalty is irrelevant i mean it's what what difference is that going to make to them there's got to be more effective policing and there's got to be more trust on both sides of the equation
