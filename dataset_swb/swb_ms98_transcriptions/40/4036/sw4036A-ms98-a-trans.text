sw4036A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.362750 [noise] 
sw4036A-ms98-a-0002 0.362750 3.333250 i think that uh one uh advantage 
sw4036A-ms98-a-0003 3.333250 12.770750 of having uh the unanimous verdict is that in a criminal case you want to make sure that you don't uh convict someone who uh really shouldn't be convicted um
sw4036A-ms98-a-0004 12.770750 22.039000 and i think that you know a unanimous verdict uh helps to ensure that i guess uh maybe one drawback of it is that if you have one juror who
sw4036A-ms98-a-0005 22.039000 26.147250 is very unreasonable in some way that uh
sw4036A-ms98-a-0006 26.147250 28.720750 you uh would have a problem
sw4036A-ms98-a-0007 28.720750 32.786250 uh you know that you wouldn't convict someone who maybe should be convicted
sw4036A-ms98-a-0008 32.786250 34.227375 [silence]
sw4036A-ms98-a-0009 34.227375 37.078000 have you ever served on a jury before
sw4036A-ms98-a-0010 37.078000 38.106500 [silence]
sw4036A-ms98-a-0011 38.106500 38.920500 oh 
sw4036A-ms98-a-0012 38.920500 40.467000 [silence]
sw4036A-ms98-a-0013 40.467000 42.681750 uh what sorts of cases were they
sw4036A-ms98-a-0014 42.681750 50.995875 [silence]
sw4036A-ms98-a-0015 50.995875 53.372500 so were they criminal or civil 
sw4036A-ms98-a-0016 53.372500 55.065250 [silence]
sw4036A-ms98-a-0017 55.065250 56.399500 oh okay
sw4036A-ms98-a-0018 56.399500 57.418250 [silence]
sw4036A-ms98-a-0019 57.418250 62.765625 what uh what was the verdict did the did the jury have trouble reaching a decision
sw4036A-ms98-a-0020 62.765625 69.665625 [silence]
sw4036A-ms98-a-0021 69.665625 70.834125 yeah
sw4036A-ms98-a-0022 70.834125 76.337750 [silence]
sw4036A-ms98-a-0023 76.337750 77.834875 so did it become
sw4036A-ms98-a-0024 77.834875 80.401750 [silence]
sw4036A-ms98-a-0025 80.401750 81.711000 yeah
sw4036A-ms98-a-0026 81.711000 83.714250 [silence]
sw4036A-ms98-a-0027 83.714250 84.768250 ah 
sw4036A-ms98-a-0028 84.768250 85.852375 [silence] 
sw4036A-ms98-a-0029 85.852375 86.701125 oh 
sw4036A-ms98-a-0030 86.701125 90.792750 but since it was a civil case it really didn't matter right you just needed a majority
sw4036A-ms98-a-0031 90.792750 94.253625 what was what was the other case that was also civil 
sw4036A-ms98-a-0032 94.253625 100.742500 [silence]
sw4036A-ms98-a-0033 100.742500 101.968375 yeah
sw4036A-ms98-a-0034 101.968375 103.392625 [silence]
sw4036A-ms98-a-0035 103.392625 104.955750 oh didn't really even count
sw4036A-ms98-a-0036 104.955750 112.513375 yeah i'm i'm a college student so i haven't been you know of a jury eligible age for very long um 
sw4036A-ms98-a-0037 112.513375 117.433750 and uh i did get um one summons actually at one point but i
sw4036A-ms98-a-0038 117.433750 122.457750 declined it which i'm able to do because i'm a student because it was uh a very bad time
sw4036A-ms98-a-0039 122.457750 125.141500 [silence]
sw4036A-ms98-a-0040 125.141500 132.556125 yeah i mean i i really i would like to uh to do it at some point um but uh i- i haven't 
sw4036A-ms98-a-0041 132.556125 136.438125 um one one thing that i- i think is um
sw4036A-ms98-a-0042 136.438125 146.880500 you know maybe is a problem is uh i- i- i think that the criminal jury system works pretty well now but i wonder if maybe in some civil cases it doesn't work as well 
sw4036A-ms98-a-0043 146.880500 149.431625 uh especially sort of 
sw4036A-ms98-a-0044 149.431625 151.484500 ow well
sw4036A-ms98-a-0045 151.484500 155.614125 [silence]
sw4036A-ms98-a-0046 155.614125 156.997000 [noise] the
sw4036A-ms98-a-0047 156.997000 159.970750 [silence]
sw4036A-ms98-a-0048 159.970750 162.484250 ah but you thought it turned out pretty well 
sw4036A-ms98-a-0049 162.484250 170.599375 [silence]
sw4036A-ms98-a-0050 170.599375 171.926000 yeah
sw4036A-ms98-a-0051 171.926000 175.666125 [silence]
sw4036A-ms98-a-0052 175.666125 180.665375 oh so it was just kind of a zoo and the jurors just sort of someone had to figure out what was going on 
sw4036A-ms98-a-0053 180.665375 190.817500 hum that's interesting did it did it work out pretty well in the end i mean did a couple of people sort of gradually sort of assume uh sort of a moderator role in the trial or 
sw4036A-ms98-a-0054 190.817500 197.989875 [silence]
sw4036A-ms98-a-0055 197.989875 200.782875 so it worked it did end up working out pretty well 
sw4036A-ms98-a-0056 200.782875 206.565875 the one thing i sometimes wonder about um in civil cases is uh 
sw4036A-ms98-a-0057 206.565875 216.249375 whether especially sort of in uh maybe like pro[duct]- product liability or medical malpractice where there's um sort of a very technical decision to be made sometimes 
sw4036A-ms98-a-0058 216.249375 223.931750 you know it's not just a matter of um of you know did this guy rip off this guy and it's just a matter of interpreting a contract it's sort of a matter of 
sw4036A-ms98-a-0059 223.931750 231.248500 uh you know sometimes getting into very technical issues and i wonder if uh if there's really um 
sw4036A-ms98-a-0060 231.248500 240.849375 if the system works adequately in in educating the jurors about uh whatever um you know issue is under discussion 
sw4036A-ms98-a-0061 240.849375 246.108000 [silence]
sw4036A-ms98-a-0062 246.108000 251.724625 in in the case you were involved in you said it was just sort of a a bank matter of some kind so 
sw4036A-ms98-a-0063 251.724625 257.417500 [silence]
sw4036A-ms98-a-0064 257.417500 258.457750 yeah

sw4036A-ms98-a-0066 260.494375 261.626875 ah
sw4036A-ms98-a-0067 261.626875 267.449625 oh so the deal was that he had uh borrowed money from the bank to buy it and he hadn't made the payments
sw4036A-ms98-a-0068 267.449625 269.137625 [silence]
sw4036A-ms98-a-0069 269.137625 270.425250 yeah
sw4036A-ms98-a-0070 270.425250 274.820750 [silence]
sw4036A-ms98-a-0071 274.820750 277.643125 ah so they were suing to get it back

sw4036A-ms98-a-0073 279.893000 281.551125 ah
