sw4046B-ms98-a-0002 0.543625 5.089250 [silence]
sw4046B-ms98-a-0003 5.089250 11.968875 nah not really my parents are still pretty young my father's forty five mother about the same age
sw4046B-ms98-a-0004 11.968875 13.779375 yeah um
sw4046B-ms98-a-0005 13.779375 16.127875 so that really hasn't been an issue for me
sw4046B-ms98-a-0006 16.127875 17.727500 how about_1 yourself
sw4046B-ms98-a-0007 17.727500 20.708500 [silence]
sw4046B-ms98-a-0008 20.708500 22.015625 um-hum
sw4046B-ms98-a-0009 22.015625 25.833750 [silence]
sw4046B-ms98-a-0010 25.833750 27.200750 um-hum
sw4046B-ms98-a-0011 27.200750 30.230250 [silence]
sw4046B-ms98-a-0012 30.230250 35.968500 right have they got any kind of uh supplemental insurance for that or
sw4046B-ms98-a-0013 35.968500 43.505750 [silence]
sw4046B-ms98-a-0014 43.505750 44.895250 um-hum
sw4046B-ms98-a-0015 44.895250 49.573750 [silence]
sw4046B-ms98-a-0016 49.573750 61.254250 yeah well i've heard about most of that insurance i was wondering because it seems like what i've heard is usually that the stuff says uh kind of thing where they cancel you a couple of years after you get in into the home
sw4046B-ms98-a-0017 61.254250 64.189500 so it tends to be kind of useless anyway
sw4046B-ms98-a-0018 64.189500 67.796875 [silence]
sw4046B-ms98-a-0019 67.796875 69.111375 um-hum

sw4046B-ms98-a-0021 70.648000 72.184125 right
sw4046B-ms98-a-0022 72.184125 73.581125 yeah
sw4046B-ms98-a-0023 73.581125 76.886625 [silence]
sw4046B-ms98-a-0024 76.886625 78.228500 um-hum

sw4046B-ms98-a-0026 81.945750 83.298500 yeah
sw4046B-ms98-a-0027 83.298500 84.600375 right
sw4046B-ms98-a-0028 84.600375 86.149625 [silence]
sw4046B-ms98-a-0029 86.149625 87.408500 yeah
sw4046B-ms98-a-0030 87.408500 94.121875 i don't know it seems to me that for the kind of money a nursing home typically costs you can maybe even afford to
sw4046B-ms98-a-0031 94.121875 97.634500 to have a nurse come into the home periodically
sw4046B-ms98-a-0032 97.634500 98.716500 [silence]
sw4046B-ms98-a-0033 98.716500 99.983000 yeah
sw4046B-ms98-a-0034 99.983000 101.381625 [silence]
sw4046B-ms98-a-0035 101.381625 105.956125 dollars a year at that point yeah it seems like you could hire somebody part time
sw4046B-ms98-a-0036 105.956125 107.366000 yeah
sw4046B-ms98-a-0037 107.366000 109.979125 and certainly more dignified than uh
sw4046B-ms98-a-0038 109.979125 111.926750 than warehousing them
sw4046B-ms98-a-0039 111.926750 114.404875 [silence]
sw4046B-ms98-a-0040 114.404875 116.050750 right
sw4046B-ms98-a-0041 116.050750 117.022375 yeah
sw4046B-ms98-a-0042 117.022375 125.596250 it's it's kind of scary because it seems like uh you know a lot of people you know it's it's uh the budgets of these places has gotten so tight
sw4046B-ms98-a-0043 125.596250 133.327125 and uh you know they just really can't take care of them_1 very well the budget and staffing especially if it's a state run 
sw4046B-ms98-a-0044 133.327125 136.222500 [silence]
sw4046B-ms98-a-0045 136.222500 137.645375 um-hum

sw4046B-ms98-a-0047 139.850125 143.870375 yeah it seems like every time i see something on television it's not good
sw4046B-ms98-a-0048 143.870375 151.210750 [silence]
sw4046B-ms98-a-0049 151.210750 152.914625 yeah
sw4046B-ms98-a-0050 152.914625 154.485750 yeah
sw4046B-ms98-a-0051 154.485750 155.877625 [silence]
sw4046B-ms98-a-0052 155.877625 158.012250 yeah it seems that way
sw4046B-ms98-a-0053 158.012250 161.353875 [silence]
sw4046B-ms98-a-0054 161.353875 171.598125 yeah i sure do they're they're pretty healthy everybody in my family seems to die when they're they're in good health but they get to be like seventy or eighty and all have aneurisms just drop dead
sw4046B-ms98-a-0055 171.598125 173.051625 [silence]
sw4046B-ms98-a-0056 173.051625 176.249000 yeah i think you know that's pretty good way to go
sw4046B-ms98-a-0057 176.249000 178.355875 [silence]
sw4046B-ms98-a-0058 178.355875 179.912875 i'd be happy
sw4046B-ms98-a-0059 179.912875 181.969250 [silence]
sw4046B-ms98-a-0060 181.969250 192.904625 yeah th[at's]- that's the worst part um seems to me that a lot of times people wind up in nursing homes who tend to survive major things like strokes or uh
sw4046B-ms98-a-0061 192.904625 199.851125 heart attacks that sort of thing and then you know they can't really help themselves so they have to be cared for
sw4046B-ms98-a-0062 199.851125 203.228125 [silence]
sw4046B-ms98-a-0063 203.228125 204.539625 right
sw4046B-ms98-a-0064 204.539625 207.898375 [silence]
sw4046B-ms98-a-0065 207.898375 215.025375 yeah i mean it seems like they'd be almost just you know better off just withholding care to some some degree 
sw4046B-ms98-a-0066 215.025375 216.553000 yeah
sw4046B-ms98-a-0067 216.553000 219.362750 [silence]
sw4046B-ms98-a-0068 219.362750 220.661750 yeah
sw4046B-ms98-a-0069 220.661750 221.904875 [silence]
sw4046B-ms98-a-0070 221.904875 227.286500 well it seems to me it's a little bit easier with the elderly because you know at least they've lived a life
sw4046B-ms98-a-0071 227.286500 228.553875 and uh
sw4046B-ms98-a-0072 228.553875 229.953375 [silence]
sw4046B-ms98-a-0073 229.953375 231.155375 yeah
sw4046B-ms98-a-0074 231.155375 232.155375 [silence]
sw4046B-ms98-a-0075 232.155375 239.264375 yeah it's something it's something like fifty percent or greater of all health care expenses are in the last five years of life
sw4046B-ms98-a-0076 239.264375 241.119125 so
sw4046B-ms98-a-0077 241.119125 242.709375 [silence]
sw4046B-ms98-a-0078 242.709375 243.998625 uh-huh
sw4046B-ms98-a-0079 243.998625 251.077125 [silence]
sw4046B-ms98-a-0080 251.077125 252.358125 right

sw4046B-ms98-a-0086 262.490625 264.010625 yeah
sw4046B-ms98-a-0087 264.010625 275.954250 seems like uh unfortunately that many of those people who are put through those if they'd uh let their wishes be known ahead of time frequently they wouldn't have been interested in heroic measures and
sw4046B-ms98-a-0088 275.954250 278.093000 if that's the case then
sw4046B-ms98-a-0089 278.093000 279.182375 [silence]
sw4046B-ms98-a-0090 279.182375 280.432750 um-hum

sw4046B-ms98-a-0093 282.621875 297.017250 yeah well i don't know my wife's a medical student and uh you know we got some of the uh Journal of the AMA and American Medical News thing and it seems like that physicians unless they're in writing or video tape or something
sw4046B-ms98-a-0094 297.017250 299.074000 that they're kind of in a
