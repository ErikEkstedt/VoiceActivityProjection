sw4046A-ms98-a-0002 0.198500 2.548000 so have you had to think about uh
sw4046A-ms98-a-0003 2.548000 5.985625 nursing homes and the elderly that sort of thing in your own life
sw4046A-ms98-a-0004 5.985625 7.763750 [silence]
sw4046A-ms98-a-0005 7.763750 9.146125 uh-huh

sw4046A-ms98-a-0008 12.686000 15.389375 [silence]
sw4046A-ms98-a-0009 15.389375 17.001875 uh-huh
sw4046A-ms98-a-0010 17.001875 22.718625 uh no my parents are getting older my father is uh
sw4046A-ms98-a-0011 22.718625 26.712500 seventy and my mother must be about sixty five
sw4046A-ms98-a-0012 26.712500 33.089875 so i'm starting to think about it but i haven't had to do anything about it yet uh my grand
sw4046A-ms98-a-0013 33.089875 35.583250 [silence]
sw4046A-ms98-a-0014 35.583250 45.835000 no i'm pretty sure they don't um they have some income from pensions and social security um
sw4046A-ms98-a-0015 45.835000 51.131875 but no i don't think they have any insurance that would cover that sort of thing
sw4046A-ms98-a-0016 51.131875 60.359250 [silence]
sw4046A-ms98-a-0017 60.359250 61.741375 [noise]
sw4046A-ms98-a-0018 61.741375 63.692000 [silence]
sw4046A-ms98-a-0019 63.692000 68.545125 yeah its my impression those costs are so high that without something
sw4046A-ms98-a-0020 68.545125 72.863750 you know special you can't handle it anyway uh
sw4046A-ms98-a-0021 72.863750 77.923875 i mean i think we might uh we talk about having them move in with us
sw4046A-ms98-a-0022 77.923875 81.665500 but there are certain health
sw4046A-ms98-a-0023 81.665500 88.042875 you know certain health conditions that we wouldn't be able to handle and i think we've just sort of avoided thinking about it real hard
sw4046A-ms98-a-0024 88.042875 96.649625 [silence]
sw4046A-ms98-a-0025 96.649625 102.906250 that might be a good alternative i mean it is my impressions tens of thousands of dollars
sw4046A-ms98-a-0026 102.906250 104.659375 yeah
sw4046A-ms98-a-0027 104.659375 106.742250 yeah what the heck
sw4046A-ms98-a-0028 106.742250 108.015625 yeah
sw4046A-ms98-a-0029 108.015625 109.935250 [silence]
sw4046A-ms98-a-0030 109.935250 111.278250 yeah its
sw4046A-ms98-a-0031 111.278250 115.345750 it it it does seem like there are a lot of horror stories out there and
sw4046A-ms98-a-0032 115.345750 116.556375 uh
sw4046A-ms98-a-0033 116.556375 117.759125 yeah
sw4046A-ms98-a-0034 117.759125 124.988375 [silence]
sw4046A-ms98-a-0035 124.988375 126.323000 yeah
sw4046A-ms98-a-0036 126.323000 131.262125 [silence]
sw4046A-ms98-a-0037 131.262125 140.882500 i saw something on Six[ty]- Sixty Minutes a few months ago about nursing homes in Texas that was a real you know horror piece
sw4046A-ms98-a-0038 140.882500 143.127250 [silence]
sw4046A-ms98-a-0039 143.127250 153.069500 yeah so and i guess you know we have to think about gee maybe we have another forty years before we'd end up in that sort of situation is it possible we could
sw4046A-ms98-a-0040 153.069500 155.893750 put away enough money to handle it ourselves
sw4046A-ms98-a-0041 155.893750 157.283750 [silence]
sw4046A-ms98-a-0042 157.283750 161.998500 huh um do you do you have grandparents who are left
sw4046A-ms98-a-0043 161.998500 170.758500 [silence]
sw4046A-ms98-a-0044 170.758500 174.014500 well that's could be worse i think
sw4046A-ms98-a-0045 174.014500 175.214375 [silence]
sw4046A-ms98-a-0046 175.214375 179.021000 if i could live until seventy or eighty and have an aneurism and drop dead i'd probably
sw4046A-ms98-a-0047 179.021000 182.405000 yeah i- i think that might be s[ufficient]- might be sufficient 
sw4046A-ms98-a-0048 182.405000 191.907750 [silence]
sw4046A-ms98-a-0049 191.907750 193.310875 um-hum

sw4046A-ms98-a-0051 197.143750 198.329125 [noise]
sw4046A-ms98-a-0052 198.329125 203.638000 yeah i mean it seems like in a case like that you'd need more help than ever to uh
sw4046A-ms98-a-0053 203.638000 208.459750 to more more support and some way to live a fulfilling life and it doesn't seem like those people are getting it 
sw4046A-ms98-a-0054 208.459750 213.922750 [silence]
sw4046A-ms98-a-0055 213.922750 223.033875 well it's always a tough question you know i mean with not only the elderly but sick people in general you know when do you withhold and when do you not
sw4046A-ms98-a-0056 223.033875 227.061000 [silence]
sw4046A-ms98-a-0057 227.061000 233.748375 you would think yeah i mean you'd think hey the clock's bound to run out at some point
sw4046A-ms98-a-0058 233.748375 238.667250 [silence]
sw4046A-ms98-a-0059 238.667250 245.921250 yeah um you my wife is a nurse and she tells me stories about uh
sw4046A-ms98-a-0060 245.921250 255.837875 the things that people are put through the so heroic measures they're put through when they're very sick some of them are very old and some aren't that uh
sw4046A-ms98-a-0061 255.837875 264.886500 everyone really knows isn't going to make a real difference but they're sort of left not knowing what else to do than everything they can do
sw4046A-ms98-a-0062 264.886500 275.246500 [silence]
sw4046A-ms98-a-0063 275.246500 284.246750 yeah my wife has c[ertain]- certain wishes that she doesn't want certain procedures done and i just hope i can remember what they [laughter-are] [laughter] it comes time to deal with it 
sw4046A-ms98-a-0064 284.246750 285.286250 [silence]
