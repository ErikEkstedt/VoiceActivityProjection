sw4085B-ms98-a-0012 24.339250 27.624000 [silence]

sw4085B-ms98-a-0014 35.734125 44.203625 [silence]
sw4085B-ms98-a-0015 44.203625 55.095250 i swear that's what i was going to say we seem to get more more uh complaints about that than about anything else although you get a good deal of complaints over other kinds of insurance too um
sw4085B-ms98-a-0016 55.095250 55.547625 [noise]
sw4085B-ms98-a-0017 55.547625 65.327125 yeah health care we have we are on the state health system which is my understanding is that it is a lot worse than the system we had when we had our own just for the university
sw4085B-ms98-a-0018 65.327125 68.572625 and i wouldn't be real surprised if that's the case um
sw4085B-ms98-a-0019 68.572625 69.201375 [noise]
sw4085B-ms98-a-0020 69.201375 75.676750 uh yeah they people are uh complaining because the rates for families uh wh[at]- you know the the uh
sw4085B-ms98-a-0021 75.676750 76.026375 [noise]
sw4085B-ms98-a-0022 76.026375 80.946750 uh the additional amount you have to pay to cover a family has gone up quite rapidly
sw4085B-ms98-a-0023 80.946750 91.480625 [silence]
sw4085B-ms98-a-0024 91.480625 92.428000 uh-huh
sw4085B-ms98-a-0025 92.428000 95.651875 [silence]
sw4085B-ms98-a-0026 95.651875 96.478500 huh
sw4085B-ms98-a-0027 96.478500 100.969625 [silence]
sw4085B-ms98-a-0028 100.969625 101.910375 right
sw4085B-ms98-a-0029 101.910375 106.006250 [silence]
sw4085B-ms98-a-0030 106.006250 106.943000 well
sw4085B-ms98-a-0031 106.943000 112.069625 do you yeah but i mean do people get to choose whether to take the the preferred preferred provider or not
sw4085B-ms98-a-0032 112.069625 113.134000 [silence]
sw4085B-ms98-a-0033 113.134000 113.645750 huh
sw4085B-ms98-a-0034 113.645750 116.141500 [silence]
sw4085B-ms98-a-0035 116.141500 124.076625 right but so so so people would stay in an existing plan that that didn't require you to go to a preferred provider in that case right 
sw4085B-ms98-a-0036 124.076625 130.339250 [silence]
sw4085B-ms98-a-0037 130.339250 132.203000 with the preferred provider
sw4085B-ms98-a-0038 132.203000 133.407250 huh
sw4085B-ms98-a-0039 133.407250 146.296875 wonder about the economics of that uh the uh you know twenty years ago when HMO's just got started uh when they started enrolling a lot of people uh it was felt that this would be the way to control health care costs
sw4085B-ms98-a-0040 146.296875 155.723250 and it worked to some degree but it didn't work that much and the reason was adverse selection the people that go into HMO's are are those that have uh
sw4085B-ms98-a-0041 155.723250 167.804875 you know that that have generally lesser health needs and i mean it's obvious why that is because the people that that that are already sick are going to see a particular doctor and they don't want to switch just to come in the HMO 
sw4085B-ms98-a-0042 167.804875 180.725750 so you get the people in the H O they they don't uh you know require that much uh care at all and then some how you got less people paying premiums into the into the uh insurance system than you have uh uh 
sw4085B-ms98-a-0043 180.725750 186.410375 you you have almost as many claims so uh that's that's caused a problem uh
sw4085B-ms98-a-0044 186.410375 190.845125 [silence]
sw4085B-ms98-a-0045 190.845125 197.879125 yes uh i don't think we have a very good cafeteria being a university industry tends to have a lot better programs
sw4085B-ms98-a-0046 197.879125 203.226250 [silence]
sw4085B-ms98-a-0047 203.226250 204.186750 uh-huh
sw4085B-ms98-a-0048 204.186750 205.655000 [silence]
sw4085B-ms98-a-0049 205.655000 206.724375 uh-huh
sw4085B-ms98-a-0050 206.724375 208.440000 [silence]
sw4085B-ms98-a-0051 208.440000 209.372875 right
sw4085B-ms98-a-0052 209.372875 211.340875 [silence]
sw4085B-ms98-a-0053 211.340875 216.977000 well i i don't know i mean the questions is should should it be the employer that pays for child care uh
sw4085B-ms98-a-0054 216.977000 231.920750 if if there were a tax credit then everybody would get it regardless who they worked for and you you would also be better in the sense that that people who had only one income in the family would get as much as people who had two and you would sort of think that the people who have one income kind of need it more 
sw4085B-ms98-a-0055 231.920750 233.720000 [silence]
sw4085B-ms98-a-0056 233.720000 234.543500 so
sw4085B-ms98-a-0057 234.543500 238.334125 [silence]
sw4085B-ms98-a-0058 238.334125 247.210375 oh yes no that that that it's true that's that's important i agree uh yeah that's true and child care is one of the big ones that that gets thrown in um 
sw4085B-ms98-a-0059 247.210375 250.983625 [silence]
sw4085B-ms98-a-0060 250.983625 252.331125 medical care
sw4085B-ms98-a-0061 252.331125 255.579750 [laughter] i don't know about that [laughter]
sw4085B-ms98-a-0062 255.579750 260.060125 you'd have you'd you'd have your office visits covered but that's only a small part of the total 
sw4085B-ms98-a-0063 260.060125 261.408875 yeah
sw4085B-ms98-a-0064 261.408875 266.648250 [silence]
sw4085B-ms98-a-0065 266.648250 279.543375 uh well i think you probably would need more denture work wouldn't you now i don't care too much about dental work because of of their dental the dental insurance because i rarely well almost never for the last eight years have i used up enough to
sw4085B-ms98-a-0066 279.543375 286.578875 uh you know paid enough in in dental bills to uh come up to even the smallest amount you can set aside monthly
sw4085B-ms98-a-0067 286.578875 295.777875 uh but not everybody is like that and people who have kids that need uh you know an orthodontist services certainly would not be in that situation
sw4085B-ms98-a-0068 295.777875 297.954000 [silence]
