sw4005A-ms98-a-0009 43.979750 49.969875 yeah it seems that well it its a seems like it's definitely a transitional time i'm not sure
sw4005A-ms98-a-0010 49.969875 56.479000 exactly what's happening there're good things that have happened but but at the moment we're suffering from
sw4005A-ms98-a-0011 56.479000 63.539750 i think information overload for one thing um just just the technology like you mentioned
sw4005A-ms98-a-0012 63.539750 72.778000 faxes and car phones and [laughter-VCRs] and all of that that make us so immediate th[ere]- there's no time for

sw4005A-ms98-a-0021 115.740500 125.276625 these sound bites you're exactly right i mean all there's all that and then we've got the rich getting richer and everyone else getting poorer
sw4005A-ms98-a-0022 125.276625 131.747000 with with you know with with little hope of of having any impact i think impotence is a
sw4005A-ms98-a-0023 131.747000 140.216875 is a a word that that suits most of America now we don't feel like we can in[fluence]- you know influence anything

sw4005A-ms98-a-0037 208.977875 217.306500 yeah i think uh i- i don't know there was a lot there was good and bad in the nuclear family we've certainly found out a lot about the bad about it
sw4005A-ms98-a-0038 217.306500 220.227000 uh but but but the community
sw4005A-ms98-a-0039 220.227000 231.689250 however the family looked and it didn't always look like a nuclear family even then you know you had generations living together or you know whatever community has just definitely been lost and
sw4005A-ms98-a-0040 231.689250 241.380125 i think a lot of people are trying to reestablish it in all sorts of different ways um you know well okay so we don't have a small town and okay so we move but
sw4005A-ms98-a-0041 241.380125 252.864875 you know maybe there's some way that we can have a group that works together you know everything from people who do live in communal you know almost commune areas that they've started up again you know
sw4005A-ms98-a-0042 252.864875 265.783125 um special cities or little towns that do that to people who do it through a church or through a book club or some[thing]- i mean something you know [noise] even offices have started sort of becoming the community

sw4005A-ms98-a-0050 286.842500 292.273500 yeah and that's a good point and and we don't have the intergener[ational]- generational
sw4005A-ms98-a-0051 292.273500 298.466000 community either which means that do you do you have to be between twenty and forty to be accepted and i[f]-
