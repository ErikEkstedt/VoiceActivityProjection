sw4005B-ms98-a-0017 89.856500 93.558375 it just has forced us to go so fast and
sw4005B-ms98-a-0018 93.558375 102.741500 um even the way we write it used to be if you read a book like you know Thomas Hardy takes two chapters to establish the mood and

sw4005B-ms98-a-0031 157.822000 161.064625 disintegrating and stuff it's just a real
sw4005B-ms98-a-0032 161.064625 167.156250 you don't have the the social networks we used to have to
sw4005B-ms98-a-0033 167.156250 173.877500 to protect the family and protect the people in the family and things like that with everyone moving

sw4005B-ms98-a-0035 185.849375 189.445750 you know heaven forbid if you ask anyone for anything
sw4005B-ms98-a-0036 189.445750 194.389750 whereas we used to be able to depend on each other and trust each other and
sw4005B-ms98-a-0037 194.389750 200.872625 you'll help me and i'll help you not and not in this corrupted sense but in the sense of

sw4005B-ms98-a-0049 265.268125 268.412000 yeah i think i think because it's a necessity
sw4005B-ms98-a-0050 268.412000 278.905375 as as as human beings we need a network around us of people we can rely on i gue[ss]- that's uh thing is that right now it's such a um
sw4005B-ms98-a-0051 278.905375 287.921750 temporary thing that how far does it go how far can you depend on them and they're so much more fragile at the touch you know
