sw4022A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.260375 [noise]
sw4022A-ms98-a-0002 0.260375 7.400375 well uh i don't know i think the budget is really out of hand right now and especially in this election year i think that uh
sw4022A-ms98-a-0003 7.400375 13.099625 there ought to be so[me]- at least some conversation about what we are supposed to do about this
sw4022A-ms98-a-0004 13.099625 17.649000 [silence]
sw4022A-ms98-a-0005 17.649000 19.220000 right
sw4022A-ms98-a-0006 19.220000 27.556000 right and uh well as you said mostly they are token cuts uh especially what for instance George Bush is offering
sw4022A-ms98-a-0007 27.556000 38.681500 yeah ninety seven cents a week now what that's really not gonna do a lot of good it doesn't seem to me to your average middle income person you know another ninety seven cents hell you can buy a Coke or something for that
sw4022A-ms98-a-0008 38.681500 43.225000 [silence]
sw4022A-ms98-a-0009 43.225000 44.824625 yeah
sw4022A-ms98-a-0010 44.824625 47.491250 [silence]
sw4022A-ms98-a-0011 47.491250 52.038625 nah that ninety seven cents really isn't gonna do it for me either uh
sw4022A-ms98-a-0012 52.038625 65.268125 i i haven't really heard much of what the other people other candidates have said that has made a lot of sense to me either especially the Democratic candidates uh don't seem to be coming up with much that really sparks my interest as far as yeah maybe that could
sw4022A-ms98-a-0013 65.268125 69.242750 do something to affect our budget at this point
sw4022A-ms98-a-0014 69.242750 76.240250 [silence]
sw4022A-ms98-a-0015 76.240250 80.722625 i believe it was Dukakis but i i can't
sw4022A-ms98-a-0016 80.722625 94.519875 yeah i mean that's better than George Bush who came out and said no i will not read my lips or whatever and then you know ten months later he said well sorry you know i i can't follow through on this but it seems to me that uh
sw4022A-ms98-a-0017 94.519875 108.395500 that the budget is so out of hand and especially now that they say okay the cold war is over and we're supposed to be getting a peace dividend of you know of X number of billion trillion dollars a year well i'd really like to know whe[re]- where that money is actually gonna go because
sw4022A-ms98-a-0018 108.395500 113.309375 in my opinion i don't think i'm ever gonna see any of this peace so called peace dividend
sw4022A-ms98-a-0019 113.309375 127.094125 i mean if they could actually pu[t]- put something together and make i'm not really in favor of large government social programs either because_1 i feel that they waste money also but with this peace dividend it seems like you could set up some kind of like public works
sw4022A-ms98-a-0020 127.094125 129.698750 projects like they had in the thirties or whatever
sw4022A-ms98-a-0021 129.698750 131.906750 [silence]
sw4022A-ms98-a-0022 131.906750 133.605750 right ex[actly]-
sw4022A-ms98-a-0023 133.605750 134.624250 [silence]
sw4022A-ms98-a-0024 134.624250 140.557000 exactly and in that way we could really focus on building the infra[structure]- structure of the country
sw4022A-ms98-a-0025 140.557000 143.456500 [silence]
sw4022A-ms98-a-0026 143.456500 155.770000 yeah and and there's no way that we can ever really recover from from the state that we're in right now unless at least i feel unless we focus on the infrastructure and i surely don't hear anybody saying that right now

sw4022A-ms98-a-0045 230.228750 231.428750 [silence]
sw4022A-ms98-a-0046 231.428750 241.625125 yeah uh well it's it's more than a loaded it's a loaded cannon i mean they've got trillions of dollars to spend every year and they in my opinion don't do a very responsible job of spending that money
sw4022A-ms98-a-0047 241.625125 255.544625 [silence]
sw4022A-ms98-a-0048 255.544625 257.132500 oh no

sw4022A-ms98-a-0052 265.722750 277.502125 for the for the moment and that's what really is getting me about what George Bush's stand on the budget is right now is that he is saying i am gonna give you this ludicrous little tax cut so that you'll be happy come November and you'll elect me again
sw4022A-ms98-a-0053 277.502125 283.638750 and then i'm gonna go on and just forget everything that i said or you know it doesn't seem that it's gonna make much of a difference
sw4022A-ms98-a-0054 283.638750 292.821875 [silence]
