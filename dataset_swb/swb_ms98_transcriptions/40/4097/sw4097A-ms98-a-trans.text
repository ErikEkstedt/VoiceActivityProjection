sw4097A-ms98-a-0009 34.503875 48.595000 no i i know my uh my mother uh my grandmother is still alive and uh feisty old old lady she's uh she's really pretty good but but she really just can't get around any more and she does have signi[ficant]- significant health problems 
sw4097A-ms98-a-0010 48.595000 58.617250 and my mom is looking after after her and it it's a big drain on my mom i can tell when i when i get calls from her she she sounds worn out 
sw4097A-ms98-a-0011 58.617250 63.649875 uh and uh it's tough on on my grandmother because she's use to just
sw4097A-ms98-a-0012 63.649875 77.878750 going to the store and getting what she wants and baking up things for her friends but now she's no longer where she grew up her friends have all passed on or in another city she can't just run right out and get things so a lot of these thing
sw4097A-ms98-a-0013 77.878750 86.941500 fall on my mom go to the store get me this i want to go do that uh i've changed my mind phone calls in the middle of the night because she's lonesome yeah
sw4097A-ms98-a-0014 86.941500 95.003500 yeah and uh you know i i can see from a distance i'm not right there on top of it maybe i am a little bit more objective but 
sw4097A-ms98-a-0015 95.003500 100.941125 i would think that they would try like to try and find her some place that first of all she could be happy

sw4097A-ms98-a-0024 148.814875 160.922000 you almost like to have some place that's almost hospice care but a little bit more independent than that almost almost like a community that has partly something like condominiums
sw4097A-ms98-a-0025 160.922000 166.718500 where those people that are mobile can still retain their their independence
sw4097A-ms98-a-0026 166.718500 178.073125 but maybe have somebody come by and check on them once or twice a day bring them the groceries or come by and chat or whatever and then a hospice for those who no longer quite so mobile
sw4097A-ms98-a-0027 178.073125 182.117625 the problem with everything else in health care is is the cost
sw4097A-ms98-a-0028 182.117625 183.317375 [silence]
sw4097A-ms98-a-0029 183.317375 195.371250 uh i mean that's that's almost why some of the you know the the experimental cooperatives you hear about where people sort of throw in all their money together and and do that sort of thing but it's it's
sw4097A-ms98-a-0030 195.371250 200.371375 [vocalized-noise] you you start getting commercialization of it and the cost just skyrockets
sw4097A-ms98-a-0031 200.371375 208.830375 so they want to really make a a a a method of it i wish that we could find some place for for my grandmother she'd be happier 
sw4097A-ms98-a-0032 208.830375 218.420625 uh and my mother wouldn't have to drop everything and and really she's lost a great deal of control of her life to the point where her own health is deteriorating
sw4097A-ms98-a-0033 218.420625 228.957125 and and that the stress is just enormous i i feel for you you're you're one step closer than i am to it and it must be it must be really draining on you
sw4097A-ms98-a-0034 228.957125 233.518750 [silence]

sw4097A-ms98-a-0046 275.359000 281.057500 somebody that comes and lives there and for the room and board takes care of people but 
sw4097A-ms98-a-0047 281.057500 286.403875 you need you need a contact service in the community i'd i'd even be happy just
sw4097A-ms98-a-0048 286.403875 298.082000 uh trying to find a a day program that my grandmother would be willing to accept that she could go and spend the day meeting so[me]- right now she tries to hold up in her apartment and the only people she
