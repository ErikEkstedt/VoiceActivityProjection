sw4026B-ms98-a-0003 2.075000 8.497750 um i really haven't had uh too many problems uh seems to me that everything that i buy
sw4026B-ms98-a-0004 8.497750 11.847750 goes bad just after the warranty runs out
sw4026B-ms98-a-0005 11.847750 14.444625 [silence]
sw4026B-ms98-a-0006 14.444625 19.973250 yeah i've had a dryer an ice maker a microwave
sw4026B-ms98-a-0007 19.973250 28.322000 all three and they unfortunately i bought them_1 all three at the same time when i bought my new house and uh
sw4026B-ms98-a-0008 28.322000 33.487125 i really don't have any recourse so i had to call and have them_1 all repaired and that
sw4026B-ms98-a-0009 33.487125 35.945250 yeah it was a hassle [noise]
sw4026B-ms98-a-0010 35.945250 38.832250 [silence]
sw4026B-ms98-a-0011 38.832250 46.111875 yeah the warranty on the refrigerator uh the i[ce]- the refrigerator warranty's still good but the ice maker itself
sw4026B-ms98-a-0012 46.111875 50.283625 lasted three years and it was three years and two months
sw4026B-ms98-a-0013 50.283625 51.974125 no
sw4026B-ms98-a-0014 51.974125 55.221500 [silence]
sw4026B-ms98-a-0015 55.221500 57.278250 uh watch out
sw4026B-ms98-a-0016 57.278250 62.977625 [silence]
sw4026B-ms98-a-0017 62.977625 64.312250 um-hum
sw4026B-ms98-a-0018 64.312250 76.154875 [silence]
sw4026B-ms98-a-0019 76.154875 77.342875 hm
sw4026B-ms98-a-0020 77.342875 87.065250 [silence]
sw4026B-ms98-a-0021 87.065250 90.672750 i usually have pretty good luck with appliances but
sw4026B-ms98-a-0022 90.672750 96.022875 i just uh it was within two days that all three of these stopped working and the
sw4026B-ms98-a-0023 96.022875 100.928625 the ice maker was uh had to have a new pump and the uh
sw4026B-ms98-a-0024 100.928625 101.941375 [silence]
sw4026B-ms98-a-0025 101.941375 107.772750 microwave had to have uh some kind of something i can't even pronounce and they uh
sw4026B-ms98-a-0026 107.772750 113.535750 the dryer had to have a new heating element so it was about almost three hundred dollars for all three of them_1
sw4026B-ms98-a-0027 113.535750 115.156875 [silence]
sw4026B-ms98-a-0028 115.156875 117.894500 uh within two days of each other
sw4026B-ms98-a-0029 117.894500 119.287000 i was
sw4026B-ms98-a-0030 119.287000 122.098000 it wasn't a good week i was pretty mad
sw4026B-ms98-a-0031 122.098000 127.152625 and plus the place that i'd bought um them all had gone out of business so
sw4026B-ms98-a-0032 127.152625 130.741500 even if uh i think even if i had uh
sw4026B-ms98-a-0033 130.741500 133.993750 had kept the warranty the service agreements were
sw4026B-ms98-a-0034 133.993750 138.614125 with the companies that that manufactured but still they were through that
sw4026B-ms98-a-0035 138.614125 144.494375 retailer so i don't know if i could've taken it to another retailer or not
sw4026B-ms98-a-0036 144.494375 145.582500 [silence]
sw4026B-ms98-a-0037 145.582500 149.208375 but i didn't have to worry about all that because
sw4026B-ms98-a-0038 149.208375 151.259875 they weren't under warranty
sw4026B-ms98-a-0039 151.259875 152.851250 so
sw4026B-ms98-a-0040 152.851250 155.923000 it was a call to the local appliance dealer
sw4026B-ms98-a-0041 155.923000 157.018375 [silence]
sw4026B-ms98-a-0042 157.018375 159.448000 who came out and fixed them_1 all but
sw4026B-ms98-a-0043 159.448000 163.736000 i the only other things that i've ever had trouble with um
sw4026B-ms98-a-0044 163.736000 168.950125 i seem to have a real bad trouble with electric hair dryers blow dryers
sw4026B-ms98-a-0045 168.950125 174.630375 yeah i've had two or three of those go out one was under warranty and
sw4026B-ms98-a-0046 174.630375 177.961750 the other two weren't but i just
sw4026B-ms98-a-0047 177.961750 180.850000 other than that you know TVs and
sw4026B-ms98-a-0048 180.850000 187.905750 things like that i haven't ever had any trouble with i don't think products are getting much better though
sw4026B-ms98-a-0049 187.905750 193.451125 [silence]
sw4026B-ms98-a-0050 193.451125 196.373250 oh really that's interesting
sw4026B-ms98-a-0051 196.373250 209.630500 [silence]
sw4026B-ms98-a-0052 209.630500 214.648125 do you do you test each individual one or do you just test
sw4026B-ms98-a-0053 214.648125 221.623375 like if you've got ten you test one and by the test results of the one you assume that the other nine are okay
sw4026B-ms98-a-0054 221.623375 230.185375 [silence]
sw4026B-ms98-a-0055 230.185375 231.518750 um-hum
sw4026B-ms98-a-0056 231.518750 253.742625 [silence]
sw4026B-ms98-a-0057 253.742625 261.250500 well that's something i've never had to use it's never i've never been involved in an automobile accident so
sw4026B-ms98-a-0058 261.250500 264.810750 luckily that's a product that i haven't had to test
sw4026B-ms98-a-0059 264.810750 268.099250 but i think it's a great idea i'm i'm
sw4026B-ms98-a-0060 268.099250 272.354875 seems like all the good logical ideas take forever to
sw4026B-ms98-a-0061 272.354875 274.476625 to come about but that
sw4026B-ms98-a-0062 274.476625 279.960500 [silence]
sw4026B-ms98-a-0063 279.960500 287.412375 oh i'm sure they wanna be thorough before they but uh even you know i don't mind spending the extra money on the car
sw4026B-ms98-a-0064 287.412375 292.737250 if you know even if they pass the savings the cost onto the consumer because
sw4026B-ms98-a-0065 292.737250 298.466000 it just seems like a real worthwhile thing i'm not a real big seat belt my uh
