sw4045B-ms98-a-0003 3.600125 14.371250 yeah they they uh get uh they regarding recycling they just gave us uh about five man about five or six months ago they passed out these um green containers to everybody in the city
sw4045B-ms98-a-0004 14.371250 28.647500 and uh they started out by just recycling newsprint and clear glass i think and or well clear glass and uh you know brownish glass and ah however no plastics oh cans was another thing that they're recycling um
sw4045B-ms98-a-0005 28.647500 37.338625 and so you know there [laughter] really wasn't a lot that i could put in there anyway i just mostly had bottles um
sw4045B-ms98-a-0006 37.338625 46.664125 and it seemed like that uh plastic would would would've been very helpful to recycle well finally they started plastics but only the kind of milk bottle plastics
sw4045B-ms98-a-0007 46.664125 49.184875 how about_1 how about_1 in your area

sw4045B-ms98-a-0015 66.828000 70.742125 [laughter] do they have a deposit on them_1
sw4045B-ms98-a-0016 70.742125 79.415125 [silence]
sw4045B-ms98-a-0017 79.415125 90.851375 right right yeah because_1 uh in in places where there's a bottle deposit i know that if you discard anything somebody will pick it up [laughter] which is a good argument in favor of deposits uh
sw4045B-ms98-a-0018 90.851375 98.702250 course uh now with Adopt-A-Highway they get rid of a lot of that anyway but i'm not sure when they do pick it up if they recycle it there uh 
sw4045B-ms98-a-0019 98.702250 101.614875 [silence]
sw4045B-ms98-a-0020 101.614875 113.149000 yeah well i mean well y[eah]- yeah but i mean if you put you know i oh i see what you mean everything would be in the same bag and they would have to separate the cans from all the rest of the trash yeah
sw4045B-ms98-a-0021 113.149000 116.614250 yeah that would that would be good because_1 uh you know
sw4045B-ms98-a-0022 116.614250 121.120125 [silence]
sw4045B-ms98-a-0023 121.120125 127.028375 um-hum right o[f]- of course if there's a deposit it's worth it for kids to do
sw4045B-ms98-a-0024 127.028375 135.551750 um now soft drink companies don't want that because it uh obviously it would have a negative effect on sales to some degree i don't know
sw4045B-ms98-a-0025 135.551750 140.115625 [silence]
sw4045B-ms98-a-0026 140.115625 150.271500 um hm i suppose yeah but that would be cheaper than getting new plastic i- i think it's just the fact it raises the price temporarily that they don't like
sw4045B-ms98-a-0027 150.271500 158.091250 it should be anyway well did you see there was an interesting article about recycling in the Wall Street Journal about three or four weeks ago
sw4045B-ms98-a-0028 158.091250 168.614625 it talked about some commodities that are being recycled uh they [laughter] they they [vocalized-noise] critics start recycling before there's an industry to deal with the stuff and 
sw4045B-ms98-a-0029 168.614625 175.830500 i forget where it was i think it was Portland Oregon ended up burning a bunch of it [laughter] it was just piling up and they had no where to put it

sw4045B-ms98-a-0037 211.662250 221.451375 [noise] yeah well i don't yeah i don't know i guess if [vocalized-noise] as far as packaging materials are c[oncerned]- are concerned if uh durable goods purchases go down you need less packaging i
sw4045B-ms98-a-0038 221.451375 228.943250 i don't know how much sensitive things like soft drinks sales are to economic conditions though i- i- i- i- i expect it
sw4045B-ms98-a-0039 228.943250 237.420625 [laughter-well] i would expect they ought to be more sensitive than they are or something i think that's one of the things people think of cutting back on but it certainly would be a way to save money [noise] um
sw4045B-ms98-a-0040 237.420625 248.790375 but um yeah i[n]- th[e]- th[e]- the article uh mentioned that it very much depend upon depended upon what kind of products you're talking about certain things and i believe clear glass is one
sw4045B-ms98-a-0041 248.790375 253.487000 there is plenty of market for they can use all they can get but it's other things
sw4045B-ms98-a-0042 253.487000 266.419375 and i think some of the plastics are are are are among those that's rather difficult to re[cycle]- it's just to recycle them there needs to be a greater economies of scale before they become uh viable

sw4045B-ms98-a-0050 291.967000 297.730000 [laughter] if i could get rid of that [laughter] it wouldn't be much at all it's just that
