sw4035B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.915750 [noise]
sw4035B-ms98-a-0002 0.915750 5.582500 um i'm i'm definitely against it definitely against it
sw4035B-ms98-a-0003 5.582500 6.608875 [silence]
sw4035B-ms98-a-0004 6.608875 16.741750 uh i think that they make a lo[t]- the system makes a lot of mistakes and a lot of innocent people are probably convicted of crimes and it's bad enough when um
sw4035B-ms98-a-0005 16.741750 22.121000 you know when it's not capital punishment but when it's capital punishment when you find out later it's too late
sw4035B-ms98-a-0006 22.121000 44.557375 [silence]
sw4035B-ms98-a-0007 44.557375 54.251875 yeah it dose because because of uh [noise] the the legal system that we have now and i'm sure you can make it cheaper if you wanted i don't think you should
sw4035B-ms98-a-0008 54.251875 62.156250 but you can make it cheaper to kill people by not allowing all the appeals and as a matter of fact i think they are starting to cut back on some of them at the Supreme Court
sw4035B-ms98-a-0009 62.156250 71.951500 um i forgot what area it is but regarding uh capital punishment there are some cases that won't automatically get reviewed by the Supreme Court when they used to be
sw4035B-ms98-a-0010 71.951500 85.657250 so what happens is you have to pay all these high powered lawyers to keep on arguing the case over and over again uh while they're waiting for capital punishment which is what happened uh which happens a lot a friend of mine uh does that type of work down in uh
sw4035B-ms98-a-0011 85.657250 89.933875 down in Tennessee he's a he's an attorney he represents people on death row 
sw4035B-ms98-a-0012 89.933875 91.015250 [silence]
sw4035B-ms98-a-0013 91.015250 98.947875 [noise] yeah yeah and i did criminal defense work for a while so i kind of have a a um [noise] let's say um
sw4035B-ms98-a-0014 98.947875 110.739000 cynical about the system and the way people are convicted of crimes not that i think i do believe that most people are charged with crimes and convic[ted]- certainly people that are convicted of crimes most of them are probably guilty anyway
sw4035B-ms98-a-0015 110.739000 115.505250 i mean i'm not denying that but there are a few that probably aren't
sw4035B-ms98-a-0016 115.505250 118.625625 [silence]
sw4035B-ms98-a-0017 118.625625 120.499750 yeah so
sw4035B-ms98-a-0018 120.499750 122.857750 [silence]
sw4035B-ms98-a-0019 122.857750 129.168500 no huh um they do in Georgia right yeah they
sw4035B-ms98-a-0020 129.168500 135.330750 [silence]
sw4035B-ms98-a-0021 135.330750 142.033625 [laughter-right] well that's the thing i mean i happened to have been talking to somebody at at uh work today about that
sw4035B-ms98-a-0022 142.033625 150.148000 just happened to come up in conversation and so i was surprised when i got this topic come up and uh the
sw4035B-ms98-a-0023 150.148000 162.791750 the bottom line was that uh [noise] what was i saying uh nobody in Tennessee has been con[victed]- has been executed since nineteen 
sw4035B-ms98-a-0024 162.791750 167.797750 uh sev[enty]- uh what seventy three or whenever it was that they ruled that the death penalty was cruel and un[constitutional]-
sw4035B-ms98-a-0025 167.797750 179.939875 yeah and whether it was unconstitutional and then like i said they came back and um like the nineteen eighties and and determined that if they have like a separate trial to determine the death penalty they call them bifricated trials
sw4035B-ms98-a-0026 179.939875 184.053000 um they have a separate trial just to determine whether they're going to give the death penalty or not
sw4035B-ms98-a-0027 184.053000 192.111250 um then then that's okay they can it it becomes constitutional i guess it's like a procedural protection that that people have 
sw4035B-ms98-a-0028 192.111250 198.999500 um but nobody's been nobody's been executed since they've brought that back and
sw4035B-ms98-a-0029 198.999500 203.617000 yeah in Tennessee so it puts a lot of pressure on them_1 [laughter-yeah] 
sw4035B-ms98-a-0030 203.617000 222.805750 [silence]
sw4035B-ms98-a-0031 222.805750 224.087875 yeah
sw4035B-ms98-a-0032 224.087875 226.555125 [silence]
sw4035B-ms98-a-0033 226.555125 239.346500 yeah but it's kind of like under under duress anyway but you know kind of saying to someone all right now that we've got you by the chops because you decide whether you're going to die or not but but yeah that's what that guy Gary Gilmore did right
sw4035B-ms98-a-0034 239.346500 241.054625 you know the guy 
sw4035B-ms98-a-0035 241.054625 242.684875 [silence]
sw4035B-ms98-a-0036 242.684875 249.653375 right and they you know kind of chose his way to death which is is kind of interesting but um
sw4035B-ms98-a-0037 249.653375 258.092250 yeah i- i- i personally think people have the right to die if they want so yeah if you if you're in dea[th]- if you're in jail for life then you should be able to commit suicide if that's what you want 
sw4035B-ms98-a-0038 258.092250 261.412000 [vocalized-noise] which is basically what that is but
sw4035B-ms98-a-0039 261.412000 273.139125 [silence]
sw4035B-ms98-a-0040 273.139125 275.340875 yeah sure
sw4035B-ms98-a-0041 275.340875 287.618000 i did some i did some en[vironmental]- environmental law as well and and one of the i remember in studying something about the F D A they was it what the hell were they trying to do they were trying to get a a a drug
sw4035B-ms98-a-0042 287.618000 289.956125 [silence]
sw4035B-ms98-a-0043 289.956125 299.714000 it was a drug that was that they were using for the death penalty and they tr[ied]- to right they tried to get it proved safe before the F D A would approve it [laughter]
