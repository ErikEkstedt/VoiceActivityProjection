sw4098A-ms98-a-0010 16.981250 21.121500 yeah i know i pay too much the reason i know this for a fact is because um
sw4098A-ms98-a-0011 21.121500 32.801000 the nature of my business is such that my income fluctuates dramatically from year to year so on the good years i pay just propor[tional]- i'm i'm viewed as wealthy and i pay a high percentage
sw4098A-ms98-a-0012 32.801000 38.358375 and on the bad years i'm not and i pay average so i either pay average or above average i don't pay below average

sw4098A-ms98-a-0040 109.017375 114.506000 yeah yeah as far as whether you get value back for your dollar
sw4098A-ms98-a-0041 114.506000 122.407375 i think the answer to that one if if you wonder the through state of through uh Washington DC awful lot of big fancy buildings there they got paid by something 
sw4098A-ms98-a-0042 122.407375 124.048750 you know
sw4098A-ms98-a-0043 124.048750 128.845375 so uh you know what's going in -[ha]s got to be a lot more -[th]an going out if it can pay for all that stuff 
sw4098A-ms98-a-0044 128.845375 133.797500 [silence]

sw4098A-ms98-a-0047 138.044500 144.633875 who is putting it in i'm just saying that what goes in must be a lot more than what comes out if there is left over for all these things
sw4098A-ms98-a-0048 144.633875 145.991875 in the middle
sw4098A-ms98-a-0049 145.991875 147.209750 yeah that's what i meant
sw4098A-ms98-a-0050 147.209750 148.112375 [vocalized-noise]
sw4098A-ms98-a-0051 148.112375 149.292750 what's that
sw4098A-ms98-a-0052 149.292750 150.306000 [silence]
sw4098A-ms98-a-0053 150.306000 153.938375 well you know it's just uh you know pass a law print up ano[ther]- billion
sw4098A-ms98-a-0054 153.938375 155.018250 [silence]
sw4098A-ms98-a-0055 155.018250 156.120000 and uh
sw4098A-ms98-a-0056 156.120000 157.996500 business as [laughter-usual]
sw4098A-ms98-a-0057 157.996500 166.939750 [silence]
sw4098A-ms98-a-0058 166.939750 170.704875 i'm not too familiar with that expression regressive versus what does that mean
sw4098A-ms98-a-0059 170.704875 171.794375 yeah
sw4098A-ms98-a-0060 171.794375 179.505875 [silence]
sw4098A-ms98-a-0061 179.505875 180.760875 right

sw4098A-ms98-a-0063 184.415250 185.523375 um-hum
sw4098A-ms98-a-0064 185.523375 192.488250 [silence]
sw4098A-ms98-a-0065 192.488250 194.835875 well that's the theory um
sw4098A-ms98-a-0066 194.835875 199.418125 [silence]
sw4098A-ms98-a-0067 199.418125 200.528875 um-hum

sw4098A-ms98-a-0071 212.125750 224.149750 yeah well they play that game here in New York but um it worki[ng]- it winds up working in very strange ways you can go to the grocery store and there's a sales tax now which is supposedly is only for necessities
sw4098A-ms98-a-0072 224.149750 235.702875 i'm sorry on[ly]- not for necessities only for non essentials and if you buy your orange juice in a paper container it's not taxed but if you buy it in a can [rec[oncentrated]-/concentrated] uh concentrated then it is taxed
sw4098A-ms98-a-0073 235.702875 236.716250 [silence]
sw4098A-ms98-a-0074 236.716250 240.028625 so um i don't claim to understand that [laughter]
sw4098A-ms98-a-0075 240.028625 242.008375 you know that's um
sw4098A-ms98-a-0076 242.008375 249.992375 and uh you know then we get into the idea of trying to modify behavior by taxing you know cranking the taxes for cigarettes and
sw4098A-ms98-a-0077 249.992375 251.611875 hope people -[w]ill stop
sw4098A-ms98-a-0078 251.611875 253.268125 yeah but you know we
sw4098A-ms98-a-0079 253.268125 255.027000 [silence]
sw4098A-ms98-a-0080 255.027000 263.465000 liquor yeah thing is you know you got to l[ook]- all all you got to do is take one look at the uh cocaine situation to realize that cranking the price up is not going to stop people [laughter] 
sw4098A-ms98-a-0081 263.465000 267.237375 [silence]
