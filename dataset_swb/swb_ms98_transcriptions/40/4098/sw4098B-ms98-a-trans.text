sw4098B-ms98-a-0050 184.786000 193.733250 you know and so the i[dea]- idea behind that is to to you know that's why we we have higher tax rates for people who have higher income right at least suppose[dly]-
sw4098B-ms98-a-0051 193.733250 202.025000 you know that's what progressive tax regressive tax is you can have a flat f[lat]- percentage tax um across the board
