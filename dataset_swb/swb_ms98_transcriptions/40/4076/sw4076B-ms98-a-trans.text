sw4076B-ms98-a-0004 12.521375 17.648500 [silence]
sw4076B-ms98-a-0005 17.648500 18.871625 really
sw4076B-ms98-a-0006 18.871625 21.340000 [silence]
sw4076B-ms98-a-0007 21.340000 22.620125 uh-huh
sw4076B-ms98-a-0008 22.620125 26.574500 [silence]
sw4076B-ms98-a-0009 26.574500 27.814500 uh-huh

sw4076B-ms98-a-0011 34.504375 36.013500 right
sw4076B-ms98-a-0012 36.013500 39.417750 [silence]
sw4076B-ms98-a-0013 39.417750 40.819625 uh-huh
sw4076B-ms98-a-0014 40.819625 43.587250 [silence]
sw4076B-ms98-a-0015 43.587250 44.746000 right
sw4076B-ms98-a-0016 44.746000 49.885125 so when you did it does the jury actually uh d[etermine]- determine the sentence
sw4076B-ms98-a-0017 49.885125 52.997500 [silence]
sw4076B-ms98-a-0018 52.997500 54.323375 uh-huh
sw4076B-ms98-a-0019 54.323375 59.127750 [silence]
sw4076B-ms98-a-0020 59.127750 60.246500 uh-huh
sw4076B-ms98-a-0021 60.246500 62.229125 [noise]
sw4076B-ms98-a-0022 62.229125 66.044125 [silence]

sw4076B-ms98-a-0024 67.419750 75.031250 [silence]
sw4076B-ms98-a-0025 75.031250 76.404375 uh-huh
sw4076B-ms98-a-0026 76.404375 81.715250 [silence]
sw4076B-ms98-a-0027 81.715250 83.215750 uh-huh
sw4076B-ms98-a-0028 83.215750 94.663750 well it seems like the the whole process i don't know a whole lot about it but one thing that i would think is is when the attorneys actually go through the selection of the jury process
sw4076B-ms98-a-0029 94.663750 105.335375 seems to me that that would that kind of biase[s]- i mean they have control over well we want this person and we don't want this person here and it seems like that could kind of bias the case toward you know their client
sw4076B-ms98-a-0030 105.335375 106.756750 [silence]
sw4076B-ms98-a-0031 106.756750 108.120000 right
sw4076B-ms98-a-0032 108.120000 110.499125 [silence]
sw4076B-ms98-a-0033 110.499125 111.914875 right
sw4076B-ms98-a-0034 111.914875 118.079375 [silence]
sw4076B-ms98-a-0035 118.079375 119.826250 right which
sw4076B-ms98-a-0036 119.826250 124.038625 [silence]
sw4076B-ms98-a-0037 124.038625 125.943875 an equal balance
sw4076B-ms98-a-0038 125.943875 126.959875 [silence]
sw4076B-ms98-a-0039 126.959875 134.906125 i- i don't know the the whole process i it's a good process i mean it i gue[ss]- our country's based on [laughter] trial [laughter-by] [laughter-jury]
sw4076B-ms98-a-0040 134.906125 135.971375 [silence]
sw4076B-ms98-a-0041 135.971375 143.152625 yeah i really do also i mean the forefathers whoe[ver]- whoever came up with the idea s[urely]- they were surely thinking a lot harder than i can think [laughter]
sw4076B-ms98-a-0042 143.152625 156.507250 but [laughter-uh] it just it seems to work pretty well in most cases then some cases like the Manuel Noriega trial i don't see how they could have found anybody in the country who didn't have some opinion on that case
sw4076B-ms98-a-0043 156.507250 164.854625 [silence]
sw4076B-ms98-a-0044 164.854625 175.450250 yeah it is that's that's one of the things that's the reason why they will often change venues of court and stuff like that to get a jury which doesn't have any any uh bias towards the case
sw4076B-ms98-a-0045 175.450250 183.639875 and it it uh it just seems like [laughter-sometimes] the people that they're going to end up with have got to be just your basic you know schmucks
sw4076B-ms98-a-0046 183.639875 191.229000 yeah it['s]- to not know [laughter-anything] about you know or not have formed any type of opinion about some of these large major cases that we've been having lately
sw4076B-ms98-a-0047 191.229000 204.445875 it just seems like tho[se]- i guess that's the one thing that i [laughter-would] think is wrong with it i don't know what you'd about it but those people are are not going to be i mean if they haven't formed some sort of opinion i don't uh i don't know what i'm trying to say really but it just
sw4076B-ms98-a-0048 204.445875 211.673375 [silence]
sw4076B-ms98-a-0049 211.673375 213.507250 that's right be[cause]-
sw4076B-ms98-a-0050 213.507250 227.444625 because having not formed an opinion to me says something about the people themselves well either they sit in a little hole you know for all their life and don't hear about anything going on in the world and i don't see how somebody like that is going to be a very good uh
sw4076B-ms98-a-0051 227.444625 231.566125 i don't kn[ow]- f[orm]- form be able to form a very coherent opinion about
sw4076B-ms98-a-0052 231.566125 233.346875 [silence]
sw4076B-ms98-a-0053 233.346875 239.066375 r[ight]- [laughter-yeah] [laughter-right] and that seems to be the opposite of what they they actually have to look for
sw4076B-ms98-a-0054 239.066375 240.071125 [silence]
sw4076B-ms98-a-0055 240.071125 241.019500 so
sw4076B-ms98-a-0056 241.019500 243.375500 [silence]
sw4076B-ms98-a-0057 243.375500 244.512250 uh-huh
sw4076B-ms98-a-0058 244.512250 247.765375 [silence]
sw4076B-ms98-a-0059 247.765375 248.945500 right
sw4076B-ms98-a-0060 248.945500 255.058375 [silence]
sw4076B-ms98-a-0061 255.058375 256.188250 uh-huh
sw4076B-ms98-a-0062 256.188250 257.311875 right
sw4076B-ms98-a-0063 257.311875 261.845750 [silence]
sw4076B-ms98-a-0064 261.845750 263.018000 uh-huh
sw4076B-ms98-a-0065 263.018000 264.253625 [silence]
sw4076B-ms98-a-0066 264.253625 275.010875 right and as far as the i don't think that the uh sentencing should be left up to the judge because that just that w[ould]- that gives too much power to any one person 
sw4076B-ms98-a-0067 275.010875 276.955750 [silence]
sw4076B-ms98-a-0068 276.955750 278.129375 right
sw4076B-ms98-a-0069 278.129375 279.134250 [silence]
sw4076B-ms98-a-0070 279.134250 291.014875 yeah that just i mean for for one person i'm s[ure]- sure they have studied the law and ha[ve]- been involved in it for so long but still i think it's this is suppose to be a system of government by the people even though that's kind of a joke
sw4076B-ms98-a-0071 291.014875 299.554000 but it still seems that the people ought to be the ones the crime was against society it ought to be society as a whole you know tha[t]- uh as represented by the jury
