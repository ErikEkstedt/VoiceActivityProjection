sw4076A-ms98-a-0003 4.188375 5.205500 [silence]
sw4076A-ms98-a-0004 5.205500 6.077000 uh
sw4076A-ms98-a-0005 6.077000 7.962875 [laughter]
sw4076A-ms98-a-0006 7.962875 9.164500 [silence]
sw4076A-ms98-a-0007 9.164500 10.420625 uh-huh
sw4076A-ms98-a-0008 10.420625 11.985625 [silence]
sw4076A-ms98-a-0009 11.985625 18.311250 yeah i was called uh once and i actually sat on a jury and it took a few weeks
sw4076A-ms98-a-0010 18.311250 21.950125 the case was suppose to the judge predicted it would take a few days
sw4076A-ms98-a-0011 21.950125 27.257000 and it just stretched out and stretched out and uh it was kind of interesting
sw4076A-ms98-a-0012 27.257000 35.306125 to uh in a in a in a way that kind of satisfied my uh or that pandered to my nosiness
sw4076A-ms98-a-0013 35.306125 39.947750 -[be]cau[se]- it was a civil case and you got to hear every little detail about how these guys had dealt with each other
sw4076A-ms98-a-0014 39.947750 44.256000 and uh you were invited to you know pass judgement on them
sw4076A-ms98-a-0015 44.256000 45.763500 [laughter]
sw4076A-ms98-a-0016 45.763500 50.366250 [silence]
sw4076A-ms98-a-0017 50.366250 53.568000 well in this case we determined the award
sw4076A-ms98-a-0018 53.568000 62.312000 um it was two fellows a bunch of money had had uh passed from one to the other and we had to decide uh
sw4076A-ms98-a-0019 62.312000 66.734000 was it -[w]as it wages was it a loan that needed to be paid back
sw4076A-ms98-a-0020 66.734000 75.639250 uh was it you know what was it and if it was something if if anybody owed anybody any money back how much did they owe
sw4076A-ms98-a-0021 75.639250 78.108125 and not only how much was
sw4076A-ms98-a-0022 78.108125 82.505000 how much did they owe but on top of that did we want to penalize them_1
sw4076A-ms98-a-0023 82.505000 83.988125 uh
sw4076A-ms98-a-0024 83.988125 93.919250 [silence]
sw4076A-ms98-a-0025 93.919250 95.219625 um-hum
sw4076A-ms98-a-0026 95.219625 100.973750 [silence]
sw4076A-ms98-a-0027 100.973750 102.041500 uh-huh
sw4076A-ms98-a-0028 102.041500 105.000500 [silence]
sw4076A-ms98-a-0029 105.000500 107.527000 well that's certainly what they're trying to do right
sw4076A-ms98-a-0030 107.527000 110.539000 uh at least there are two of them
sw4076A-ms98-a-0031 110.539000 113.213250 uh knocking off
sw4076A-ms98-a-0032 113.213250 118.878250 i guess i guess all they can do is knock off the people they think would be most biased against them
sw4076A-ms98-a-0033 118.878250 124.494000 so maybe maybe by knocking off extreme cases on both sides you end up with
sw4076A-ms98-a-0034 124.494000 125.507375 [silence]
sw4076A-ms98-a-0035 125.507375 126.823500 maybe
sw4076A-ms98-a-0036 126.823500 132.705875 [silence]
sw4076A-ms98-a-0037 132.705875 136.862375 it could be it could be worse i- i find it hard to think of something better 
sw4076A-ms98-a-0038 136.862375 142.272125 [silence]
sw4076A-ms98-a-0039 142.272125 143.898875 [laughter]
sw4076A-ms98-a-0040 143.898875 155.487875 [silence]
sw4076A-ms98-a-0041 155.487875 165.569500 [noise] yeah that seems like uh it seems like you'd have to ig[nore]- either ignore that i mean is it a requirement that you don't already have an opinion
sw4076A-ms98-a-0042 165.569500 169.691000 [silence]
sw4076A-ms98-a-0043 169.691000 171.000375 uh-huh
sw4076A-ms98-a-0044 171.000375 172.987875 [silence]
sw4076A-ms98-a-0045 172.987875 174.496375 uh-huh
sw4076A-ms98-a-0046 174.496375 182.585125 [silence]
sw4076A-ms98-a-0047 182.585125 184.510625 they got to have a problem
sw4076A-ms98-a-0048 184.510625 190.144625 [silence]
sw4076A-ms98-a-0049 190.144625 191.947000 yeah yeah
sw4076A-ms98-a-0050 191.947000 202.945750 [silence]
sw4076A-ms98-a-0051 202.945750 214.261125 yeah it would almost be as if if it if they could somehow say hey having an opinion's okay it's being willing to change it that's important thing 
sw4076A-ms98-a-0052 214.261125 222.016500 [silence]
sw4076A-ms98-a-0053 222.016500 223.251750 uh-huh
sw4076A-ms98-a-0054 223.251750 230.144375 [silence]
sw4076A-ms98-a-0055 230.144375 232.818750 right i mean you want people who are
sw4076A-ms98-a-0056 232.818750 235.109125 engaged [laughter]
sw4076A-ms98-a-0057 235.109125 238.492000 [silence]
sw4076A-ms98-a-0058 238.492000 239.751625 uh-huh
sw4076A-ms98-a-0059 239.751625 240.862125 [silence]
sw4076A-ms98-a-0060 240.862125 244.042375 uh well tha[t]- that was one nice thing about the civil case
sw4076A-ms98-a-0061 244.042375 246.500500 is that it it was nothing that
sw4076A-ms98-a-0062 246.500500 250.913125 had shown up in the papers you know it was just two guys the
sw4076A-ms98-a-0063 250.913125 256.565625 what they the only thing they looked for was if you had been in a similar situation yourself
sw4076A-ms98-a-0064 256.565625 258.367500 and i guess they figured you
sw4076A-ms98-a-0065 258.367500 259.965250 you know
sw4076A-ms98-a-0066 259.965250 265.487250 you would be biased in favor of which ever party you identified with
sw4076A-ms98-a-0067 265.487250 274.103375 [silence]
sw4076A-ms98-a-0068 274.103375 279.642875 it does seem like the judge has a lot of power in the first place and why give him this part also
sw4076A-ms98-a-0069 279.642875 290.322750 [silence]
sw4076A-ms98-a-0070 290.322750 291.933250 [laughter-uh-huh]
