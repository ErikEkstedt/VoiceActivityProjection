sw4075B-ms98-a-0002 0.704000 1.542375 so
sw4075B-ms98-a-0003 1.542375 21.083375 [silence]
sw4075B-ms98-a-0004 21.083375 22.241625 right
sw4075B-ms98-a-0005 22.241625 26.396375 [silence]
sw4075B-ms98-a-0006 26.396375 29.214500 right here in Philadelphia the
sw4075B-ms98-a-0007 29.214500 39.409000 city for residential customers has certain they [vocalized-noise] had a trial section that was having curb side recycling with special containers
sw4075B-ms98-a-0008 39.409000 48.982750 and then they decided to go ahead and phase it in piece by piece so every year a different piece of the city gets added to the list
sw4075B-ms98-a-0009 48.982750 54.772000 but in my neighborhood they have had voluntary recycling for several years now
sw4075B-ms98-a-0010 54.772000 60.536625 you on the first and third Saturdays of every month you take your
sw4075B-ms98-a-0011 60.536625 69.880250 bottles and your newspapers and lets see bottles newspapers to certain corners in the neighborhood
sw4075B-ms98-a-0012 69.880250 75.312625 and there is a farmer's market that collects the plastic they uh
sw4075B-ms98-a-0013 75.312625 77.372625 it use to be a firehouse
sw4075B-ms98-a-0014 77.372625 86.603125 but they're trying to get some urban renewal going in here and trying to make the area safer i live near the University of Pennsylvania where i'm a grad student
sw4075B-ms98-a-0015 86.603125 89.728000 and it's not the safest neighborhood there is
sw4075B-ms98-a-0016 89.728000 97.418875 so they are trying to get urban renewal going and they one of the things that this farmer's market does is collect plastic
sw4075B-ms98-a-0017 97.418875 104.023375 and they use that money to keep up the building and organize events and that kind of thing
sw4075B-ms98-a-0018 104.023375 114.485000 [silence]
sw4075B-ms98-a-0019 114.485000 120.429000 right they have that for the plastic bags here too yeah let's see and the
sw4075B-ms98-a-0020 120.429000 121.516500 um
sw4075B-ms98-a-0021 121.516500 129.369375 [silence]
sw4075B-ms98-a-0022 129.369375 133.357500 uh-huh how about aluminum cans do they recycle that
sw4075B-ms98-a-0023 133.357500 146.901500 [silence]
sw4075B-ms98-a-0024 146.901500 155.694625 right well the only part the thing is that it's probably isn't profitable to just from um a standpoint of making new paper to recycle
sw4075B-ms98-a-0025 155.694625 160.972750 but where you end up having a savings is at your landfill last so much longer
sw4075B-ms98-a-0026 160.972750 163.188625 [silence]
sw4075B-ms98-a-0027 163.188625 165.735375 down home i know my folks
sw4075B-ms98-a-0028 165.735375 166.990625 um
sw4075B-ms98-a-0029 166.990625 177.668250 live in South Carolina and they have had some landfill filling up problems and they county built a new landfill and a site that wasn't geologically proper
sw4075B-ms98-a-0030 177.668250 190.798250 so that the landfill consideration is a good reason that probably communities are still going to end up paying to have the paper taken away but they'll just won't have to build landfills as often
sw4075B-ms98-a-0031 190.798250 200.648375 another things that they are doing not at home but in the offices here is recycling of paper and
sw4075B-ms98-a-0032 200.648375 205.732750 that is done by separating the white paper which is i guess is a higher quality
sw4075B-ms98-a-0033 205.732750 208.444500 from the miscellaneous paper
sw4075B-ms98-a-0034 208.444500 211.912375 and well they also [vocalized-noise] recycle aluminum cans
sw4075B-ms98-a-0035 211.912375 219.905875 they have every office has two little cardboard boxes for putting in the white paper and the mixed paper
sw4075B-ms98-a-0036 219.905875 227.050750 and big trash cans down at the ends of the hallways that when they get filled up you can go take them down the hall
sw4075B-ms98-a-0037 227.050750 234.315375 [silence]
sw4075B-ms98-a-0038 234.315375 247.898750 oh you know that's one thing that kind of bothered me i now when i i use to get my o[il]- my oil changed when i go down to South Carolina there has been a Goodyear tire store that has been servicing my car for a number of years
sw4075B-ms98-a-0039 247.898750 254.437500 and they have pretty economical rates but now in South Carolina there is this
sw4075B-ms98-a-0040 254.437500 264.536750 mandatory waste recycling fee and my daddy w[ould]- would like to to get the used oil to pour over fence posts
sw4075B-ms98-a-0041 264.536750 274.394375 so you know to make the fence posts last longer and weather better but the oil the the uh Goodyear store won't even
sw4075B-ms98-a-0042 274.394375 279.086625 they say they can't give you the oil they say it's against the federal law now
sw4075B-ms98-a-0043 279.086625 284.340750 and that they have to charge the waste recycling fee
sw4075B-ms98-a-0044 284.340750 293.537500 so the only way you can get in South Carolina anyway and they say it's because of federal law but you can get your used oil back is to do it yourself
