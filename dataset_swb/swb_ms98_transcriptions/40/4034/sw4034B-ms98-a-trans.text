sw4034B-ms98-a-0030 108.612500 114.484625 there were volunteer agencies that would do it uh at a minimal charge and a lot of the
sw4034B-ms98-a-0031 114.484625 122.309375 the articles in the papers or the letters in the papers these days have suggested that that the waste haulers now that they have a monopoly uh
