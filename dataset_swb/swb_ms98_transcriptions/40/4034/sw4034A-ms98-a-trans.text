sw4034A-ms98-a-0042 159.210875 160.851250 well we have uh
sw4034A-ms98-a-0043 160.851250 161.876750 [silence]
sw4034A-ms98-a-0044 161.876750 175.483375 some volunteer run recycling in some towns near here uh in [vocalized-noise] our own neighborhood there's a private company that comes around once a week and uh picks up recyclables they do not pick up magazines
sw4034A-ms98-a-0045 175.483375 183.975375 uh and i believe they don't pick up the plastic i think it's the two categories you talked about it's just newspapers bottles cans
sw4034A-ms98-a-0046 183.975375 186.213125 and uh cardboard
sw4034A-ms98-a-0047 186.213125 188.450875 and it used to be free
sw4034A-ms98-a-0048 188.450875 191.830125 for a few weeks then they
sw4034A-ms98-a-0049 191.830125 198.854375 sent out little flyers saying hey we still want to do this for free but we're not quite making ends meet and we'll take donations
sw4034A-ms98-a-0050 198.854375 200.027750 and i
sw4034A-ms98-a-0051 200.027750 208.505875 i'm i don't not sure if anybody really sent donations in to this private company just to be nice and i believe they're going to start charging now
sw4034A-ms98-a-0052 208.505875 210.115875 uh
sw4034A-ms98-a-0053 210.115875 211.923500 and i [vocalized-noise]
sw4034A-ms98-a-0054 211.923500 217.000625 i'm not sure what we're going to do i mean it definitely diminishes the amount of trash we have to put out
sw4034A-ms98-a-0055 217.000625 219.388000 so it may work out monetarily
sw4034A-ms98-a-0056 219.388000 221.985750 okay for us to be charged for it
sw4034A-ms98-a-0057 221.985750 227.259125 uh and since they are private if they charge too much they'll people will just start throwing it in the trash
sw4034A-ms98-a-0058 227.259125 230.951000 [silence]
sw4034A-ms98-a-0059 230.951000 233.955625 right we pay for our trash pickup but this isn't the trash people

sw4034A-ms98-a-0066 252.238125 260.489750 very small scale people who go around with shopping carts about an hour before his truck comes and try to get the most valuable recyclables
