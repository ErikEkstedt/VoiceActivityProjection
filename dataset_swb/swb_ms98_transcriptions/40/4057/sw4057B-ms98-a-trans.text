sw4057B-ms98-a-0006 13.181500 14.245250 [laughter]
sw4057B-ms98-a-0007 14.245250 15.336625 they had
sw4057B-ms98-a-0008 15.336625 16.277125 [laughter]
sw4057B-ms98-a-0009 16.277125 19.851375 are Americans still paying too much too many taxes
sw4057B-ms98-a-0010 19.851375 24.219750 that's a that's an easy one are we supposed to spend five minutes on this
sw4057B-ms98-a-0011 24.219750 28.028125 well no [laughter] i mean yes [laughter]
sw4057B-ms98-a-0012 28.028125 31.409375 [silence]
sw4057B-ms98-a-0013 31.409375 35.793500 yeah yeah i don't think we're paying a lot too much i uh
sw4057B-ms98-a-0014 35.793500 42.226000 i think we're paying i i i used to live in Sweden and uh i know that they pay a lot more than we do
sw4057B-ms98-a-0015 42.226000 44.205250 [silence]
sw4057B-ms98-a-0016 44.205250 48.117375 yeah so i guess we should be grateful that it's as low as it is
sw4057B-ms98-a-0017 48.117375 51.336000 [silence]
sw4057B-ms98-a-0018 51.336000 54.828500 yes i i'm from Idaho actually
sw4057B-ms98-a-0019 54.828500 62.092625 yeah yeah i wa[s]- so when i was living in Sweden i got uh an im[pression]- kind of an impression of their system which is socialistic 
sw4057B-ms98-a-0020 62.092625 69.700125 and so they everything is subsidized by their government their their taxes are higher than ours so i guess i shouldn't be i shouldn't complain so much
sw4057B-ms98-a-0021 69.700125 77.497000 i uh i do get concerned that there's that there's a lot of uh government spending on things like um
sw4057B-ms98-a-0022 77.497000 79.119625 [silence]
sw4057B-ms98-a-0023 79.119625 89.593750 things that that don't really benefit anyone outside of the congressman's district who proposes the measure like restoring some old ship or something like that
sw4057B-ms98-a-0024 89.593750 91.480750 it
sw4057B-ms98-a-0025 91.480750 92.941000 [silence]
sw4057B-ms98-a-0026 92.941000 94.074125 [noise]
sw4057B-ms98-a-0027 94.074125 95.845125 right
sw4057B-ms98-a-0028 95.845125 110.849875 [silence]
sw4057B-ms98-a-0029 110.849875 114.987000 you wouldn't mind paying that much if you were getting that equivalent value for it
sw4057B-ms98-a-0030 114.987000 118.879875 [silence]
sw4057B-ms98-a-0031 118.879875 120.396625 i can go
sw4057B-ms98-a-0032 120.396625 130.206875 [silence]
sw4057B-ms98-a-0033 130.206875 138.152000 yeah i think i have to agree although i pay an awful lot of taxes because i'm single i'm in a reasonably high tax bracket
sw4057B-ms98-a-0034 138.152000 139.474750 so
sw4057B-ms98-a-0035 139.474750 143.811625 um it seems very expensive to me for what i get
sw4057B-ms98-a-0036 143.811625 148.343625 [silence]
sw4057B-ms98-a-0037 148.343625 161.595250 no although i get some things that i very much appreciate i mean i don't i don't have a dictator i don't i'm not reporting for a dictator i live in a free economy and so i mean in a sense i don't mind spending money on
sw4057B-ms98-a-0038 161.595250 164.710250 and uh welfare on
sw4057B-ms98-a-0039 164.710250 168.336875 reasonable amounts of welfare i don't mind spending money on
sw4057B-ms98-a-0040 168.336875 171.873625 and things like highways and stuff i don't mind spending on
sw4057B-ms98-a-0041 171.873625 199.589000 [silence]
sw4057B-ms98-a-0042 199.589000 201.009000 huh
sw4057B-ms98-a-0043 201.009000 203.996750 don't know if i agree with that or not
sw4057B-ms98-a-0044 203.996750 213.106500 i mean because there's people that just plain i don't know what the percentage is but there is some percentage of people out there that just cannot get a job for whatever reason
sw4057B-ms98-a-0045 213.106500 216.324750 although two years that does sound like quite a while
sw4057B-ms98-a-0046 216.324750 218.756625 i don't know what do you think of that one
sw4057B-ms98-a-0047 218.756625 229.360125 [silence]
sw4057B-ms98-a-0048 229.360125 232.419000 he certainly seems to be looking at the right issue
sw4057B-ms98-a-0049 232.419000 243.623250 um one thing that i've kind of been following that i i'd really i'm kind of waiting for it and i maybe after the presidential elections we'll see it and that is for President Bush to uh see if he can
sw4057B-ms98-a-0050 243.623250 247.540500 see if he can uh give the line item veto a try
sw4057B-ms98-a-0051 247.540500 252.108375 and uh apparently he's been waiting for a test case he's been waiting for quite a while
sw4057B-ms98-a-0052 252.108375 261.231125 but i think it'd be fascinating to see him try vetoing some of the one of these rider bills that's that's clearly a waste of money and to see how Congress reacts to that
sw4057B-ms98-a-0053 261.231125 263.645000 that'd be quite an exciting battle
sw4057B-ms98-a-0054 263.645000 269.765125 [silence]
sw4057B-ms98-a-0055 269.765125 271.102250 uh-huh
