sw4041A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 6.088625 i haven't had to put anyone in a nursing home but we came close have you had that experience yet
sw4041A-ms98-a-0002 6.088625 11.202625 [silence]
sw4041A-ms98-a-0003 11.202625 12.749500 um-hum
sw4041A-ms98-a-0004 12.749500 15.195875 [silence]
sw4041A-ms98-a-0005 15.195875 17.631750 that's for sure yeah
sw4041A-ms98-a-0006 17.631750 21.889125 [silence]
sw4041A-ms98-a-0007 21.889125 29.023500 um-hum um-hum uh yeah i had a a good friend who just did it and and my boss too [laughter]
sw4041A-ms98-a-0008 29.023500 39.096500 yeah and uh and uh well both his parents were s[ick]- not doing well went to take care of one and then one of them died and then it was
sw4041A-ms98-a-0009 39.096500 44.583750 what do you do with the other person it's particularly hard if they live away
sw4041A-ms98-a-0010 44.583750 46.241625 [silence]
sw4041A-ms98-a-0011 46.241625 47.802875 um-hum
sw4041A-ms98-a-0012 47.802875 50.751625 [silence]
sw4041A-ms98-a-0013 50.751625 52.059875 yeah
sw4041A-ms98-a-0014 52.059875 55.134375 [silence]
sw4041A-ms98-a-0015 55.134375 59.984875 well that's a problem and i [vocalized-noise] uh my grandmother was ninety
sw4041A-ms98-a-0016 59.984875 73.891625 two ninety three when she died and she was able to stay in her apartment but the but the cost of that was unbelievable to have the nurses now i don't know that it would have been any better in a nursing home but at that point
sw4041A-ms98-a-0017 73.891625 84.468250 it was you know uh she was old enough that it was like that's where sh[e]- she wanted to die was where she was not to
sw4041A-ms98-a-0018 84.468250 93.105750 staying at home yeah not going somewhere else i think it's harder if they if they're younger but need a lot of care
sw4041A-ms98-a-0019 93.105750 100.038250 you know at ninety that's one thing at at sixty or seventy it's something else and yet
sw4041A-ms98-a-0020 100.038250 102.761750 [silence]
sw4041A-ms98-a-0021 102.761750 105.204500 right right
sw4041A-ms98-a-0022 105.204500 112.540500 right exactly and if the and and yet if the care is just is just so hard then that's
sw4041A-ms98-a-0023 112.540500 122.209750 you know that's really hard and i don't know what you know what the different things that you would look for i mean obviously uh you want it to be cl[ean]- you know
sw4041A-ms98-a-0024 122.209750 130.760000 clean and that that it's got a good reputation as far as health et cetera but then atmosphere seems like would make so much difference
sw4041A-ms98-a-0025 130.760000 137.756375 [silence]
sw4041A-ms98-a-0026 137.756375 142.866250 yes that that's the picture you always see of people just sitting in the halls
sw4041A-ms98-a-0027 142.866250 144.597750 oh
sw4041A-ms98-a-0028 144.597750 150.867125 [silence]
sw4041A-ms98-a-0029 150.867125 153.348625 Alzheimer yeah
sw4041A-ms98-a-0030 153.348625 161.325625 [silence]
sw4041A-ms98-a-0031 161.325625 162.727750 uh-huh
sw4041A-ms98-a-0032 162.727750 163.988500 [silence]
sw4041A-ms98-a-0033 163.988500 165.419875 yeah
sw4041A-ms98-a-0034 165.419875 166.591625 [silence]
sw4041A-ms98-a-0035 166.591625 176.376750 well i that's the thing i mean when it's something like that i- i think it particularly if it's something like that and they really don't know where they are
sw4041A-ms98-a-0036 176.376750 183.187625 it doesn't feel i would think that would be easier than someone who really does know and is saying i d[on't]-
sw4041A-ms98-a-0037 183.187625 185.492625 exactly
sw4041A-ms98-a-0038 185.492625 191.382750 and i you know i do[n't]- i don't want to go kind of thing but the other side of it is that my grandmother
sw4041A-ms98-a-0039 191.382750 201.626875 moved out of her home and into an apartment of elderly people but it is was not a nursing home and that's where she died but she lived there for ten or twelve years
sw4041A-ms98-a-0040 201.626875 210.827125 and she did she really went through uh like a depression for about a year moving out of her home but then she said
sw4041A-ms98-a-0041 210.827125 225.113625 w[ell]- she says course this is so wonderful because all i have to do is open my door you know go out the hall and down stairs to the place to eat or down stairs to the lobby and there're people there
sw4041A-ms98-a-0042 225.113625 236.917000 which in her home you know there weren't i mean the logistics of it become so difficult that she said i've i've really made some friends and that feels good so that's the other side of it is
sw4041A-ms98-a-0043 236.917000 239.670500 [silence]
sw4041A-ms98-a-0044 239.670500 242.121875 um-hum um-hum
sw4041A-ms98-a-0045 242.121875 243.687125 [silence]
sw4041A-ms98-a-0046 243.687125 246.977125 yeah but but it's just that
sw4041A-ms98-a-0047 246.977125 255.382500 you know how do you i guess unless you visit a lot and unexpectedly and assuming that you can visit unexpectedly
sw4041A-ms98-a-0048 255.382500 260.234875 [silence]
sw4041A-ms98-a-0049 260.234875 261.724625 uh-huh
sw4041A-ms98-a-0050 261.724625 265.981625 [silence]
sw4041A-ms98-a-0051 265.981625 274.248750 exactly and how everything looks and and then and then the other thing is really listen to what they say because and that's another hard thing
sw4041A-ms98-a-0052 274.248750 279.652500 uh you know if the as people get older we we all seem to uh
sw4041A-ms98-a-0053 279.652500 288.383375 fuss just a little bit more about everything so then the question is is the fussing legitimate or not [laughter]
sw4041A-ms98-a-0054 288.383375 290.538500 uh-huh
sw4041A-ms98-a-0055 290.538500 296.331875 so they'll tell you well she says she doesn't like the food but you should see her plate you know or some
sw4041A-ms98-a-0056 296.331875 299.074000 so then y[ou]- i guess you'd have to be there to be sure that that's
