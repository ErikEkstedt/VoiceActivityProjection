sw4069A-ms98-a-0040 114.643500 115.866375 [silence]
sw4069A-ms98-a-0041 115.866375 125.654750 well that's funny well i- i we we do have more facilities than that around here so that we they're they are trying in Dallas to do some
sw4069A-ms98-a-0042 125.654750 136.230500 uh curbside recycling they've got sp[ecial]- special you they selected sites and in those sites they they've been doing it and they've had a pretty good success so they're talking about_1
sw4069A-ms98-a-0043 136.230500 144.783375 you know doing it more but it isn't in my area so i've got a kitchen full of you know cans and bottles and scrap metal and
sw4069A-ms98-a-0044 144.783375 150.716625 everything and and then i have to drive it somewhere and there
sw4069A-ms98-a-0045 150.716625 152.745625 [silence]
sw4069A-ms98-a-0046 152.745625 161.214250 uh then everybody would do it well it's one of those things that makes you feel good you know makes you feel like you're part of of a of a solution to a problem 
sw4069A-ms98-a-0047 161.214250 167.716875 and and uh there's not that much that makes you feel like you've got any control over anything [laughter-so]

sw4069A-ms98-a-0051 179.276000 189.073375 and that's strange because now bottles are the one thing that are totally recyclable they're the easiest and and uh you know i mean i try to keep and reuse and i
sw4069A-ms98-a-0052 189.073375 200.582625 oh i even carry around uh you know like if i- i- i travel around the city a lot so that i'm frequently stopping at fast food place and eating [laughter] in the car or on the way to the next site
sw4069A-ms98-a-0053 200.582625 209.685625 and i've gotten to saving the plastic forks and washing them and using them_1 again so i don't keep doing that but boy i mean it's an exhausting way to [laughter-live]
sw4069A-ms98-a-0054 209.685625 214.993250 [vocalized-noise] we are very use to throwing things out there's no question about it and
sw4069A-ms98-a-0055 214.993250 217.307875 [silence]
sw4069A-ms98-a-0056 217.307875 218.755500 uh-huh
sw4069A-ms98-a-0057 218.755500 220.375375 [silence]
sw4069A-ms98-a-0058 220.375375 226.544000 ye[ah]- right ex[actly]- [laughter-exactly] lots of little uh soya sauces and ketchups all over the place
sw4069A-ms98-a-0059 226.544000 228.174625 [laughter-yeah]
sw4069A-ms98-a-0060 228.174625 230.530500 [silence]
sw4069A-ms98-a-0061 230.530500 238.785625 that's right that's right well now i've gotten to where i say don't put any of that in [laughter] because_1 it just leaves me with having to dispose of it
sw4069A-ms98-a-0062 238.785625 243.510375 no [laughter-please] [laughter-no]
sw4069A-ms98-a-0063 243.510375 246.501500 [silence]
sw4069A-ms98-a-0064 246.501500 247.745375 yeah
sw4069A-ms98-a-0065 247.745375 255.108875 and that's hard to get rid of unless you've got there's one place here in town that will take the slicks and all your junk mail and
sw4069A-ms98-a-0066 255.108875 268.906750 cereal boxes and everything but you have to drive it downtown and so you know my kitchen i mean certainly i don't like anyone to ever come in because i've just got this stuff everywhere i don't drive it every day so i've got just piles of it
sw4069A-ms98-a-0067 268.906750 273.098750 [silence]
sw4069A-ms98-a-0068 273.098750 274.898000 right
sw4069A-ms98-a-0069 274.898000 279.372000 but but you have to move out of your house to have all that yeah
sw4069A-ms98-a-0070 279.372000 281.107250 [silence]
sw4069A-ms98-a-0071 281.107250 292.982875 yeah yeah i know and i[t]- and it it really is hard and and uh i then i'll fill up the back of my [laughter-car] and i'm driving around with trash [laughter-in] [laughter-my] [laughter-car] and tha[t]- well at least maybe it keeps someone from stealing 
sw4069A-ms98-a-0072 292.982875 299.074000 you know because [laughter] they'll think there's nothing in this car but trash [laughter] [laughter-anyway]
