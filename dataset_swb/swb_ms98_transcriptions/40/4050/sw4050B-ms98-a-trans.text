sw4050B-ms98-a-0009 21.930750 25.119125 [silence]
sw4050B-ms98-a-0010 25.119125 26.574375 uh
sw4050B-ms98-a-0011 26.574375 34.368250 yes and no it wasn't really a fa[mily]- a planning one but it was kind of uh it was a birthday and i brought a lot of family together then
sw4050B-ms98-a-0012 34.368250 37.191500 [silence]
sw4050B-ms98-a-0013 37.191500 44.249000 it went pretty good i'm i've worked in hotels so i- i kind of know how to do [laughter-these] [laughter-things] i used to you know
sw4050B-ms98-a-0014 44.249000 52.807375 [silence]
sw4050B-ms98-a-0015 52.807375 57.497625 usually when we have kind of our family reunion it's my grandmother's birthday and
sw4050B-ms98-a-0016 57.497625 65.018250 and it's all of like she she comes from a big family she has like seven sisters i think
sw4050B-ms98-a-0017 65.018250 70.397000 and they show up and all their kids and then a[ll]- she has uh i have
sw4050B-ms98-a-0018 70.397000 76.479375 like uh let's see she has four sons and two daughters and
sw4050B-ms98-a-0019 76.479375 83.134125 they show up and all their kids so it's a pretty big reunion it's about two hundred people maybe
sw4050B-ms98-a-0020 83.134125 91.823375 [silence]
sw4050B-ms98-a-0021 91.823375 98.631375 um the probably the biggest challenge was uh getting a place where everyone
sw4050B-ms98-a-0022 98.631375 103.740250 you know could eat comfortably and and everything uh
sw4050B-ms98-a-0023 103.740250 107.888625 i guess probably the most helpful thing was that uh
sw4050B-ms98-a-0024 107.888625 114.826125 for the rent uh we rented like a a rescue squad building or something like that and uh
sw4050B-ms98-a-0025 114.826125 119.928750 each one of the everybody that showed up do[nated]- donated some money for the rent and for
sw4050B-ms98-a-0026 119.928750 129.086250 for like soft drinks and and so nobody like really got stuck with the bill [vocalized-noise] each person in the family you know brought a dish or some [noise]
sw4050B-ms98-a-0027 129.086250 133.238250 [silence]
sw4050B-ms98-a-0028 133.238250 138.897375 it was kind of potluck you know everybody brought their specialties i guess you would say
sw4050B-ms98-a-0029 138.897375 140.090750 [silence]
sw4050B-ms98-a-0030 140.090750 141.223625 yeah
sw4050B-ms98-a-0031 141.223625 146.948750 and of course my grandmother's food was as always gone first because she's such a great cook
sw4050B-ms98-a-0032 146.948750 148.435500 [silence]
sw4050B-ms98-a-0033 148.435500 150.580375 uh she's eighty six
sw4050B-ms98-a-0034 150.580375 153.198000 [silence]
sw4050B-ms98-a-0035 153.198000 156.922875 now she does she looks probably like she's in her early sixties
sw4050B-ms98-a-0036 156.922875 163.385500 and if she didn't have arthritis she'd get around better than me as a matter of fact [laughter]
sw4050B-ms98-a-0037 163.385500 167.388625 [silence]
sw4050B-ms98-a-0038 167.388625 171.753000 oh yeah uh my nickname for her is honey woman that's what i call her
sw4050B-ms98-a-0039 171.753000 172.682250 [laughter]
sw4050B-ms98-a-0040 172.682250 209.787875 [silence]
sw4050B-ms98-a-0041 209.787875 223.068625 uh also one thing that's helpful and i don't know if your family's spread out or whatever but most of all my family lives like in the same county [laughter] so it's just kind of like get on the telephone and
sw4050B-ms98-a-0042 223.068625 228.020375 it's so and such days from such and such date and everybody just shows up
sw4050B-ms98-a-0043 228.020375 245.384750 [silence]
sw4050B-ms98-a-0044 245.384750 249.015000 i would say you're spread out then [laughter]
sw4050B-ms98-a-0045 249.015000 257.696000 uh my my immediate family you know my my parents and my brothers and sisters i guess we're the ones that have the gypsy blood or whatever because_1 my dad was in the Army and we w[ere]-
sw4050B-ms98-a-0046 257.696000 266.861375 we were pretty strung out all over but since they've moved back to Carolina's uh we still are the only ones do not live in in Anson County [laughter]

sw4050B-ms98-a-0048 277.317875 283.496125 we're spread out but everybody else is centralized in in my home town Waynesboro so
sw4050B-ms98-a-0049 283.496125 292.156500 nobody moves away except us [laughter] yeah i got out as soon as i graduated [laughter]
sw4050B-ms98-a-0050 292.156500 296.374750 just like this town is too small for me good-bye [laughter]
sw4050B-ms98-a-0051 296.374750 298.178000 [silence]
