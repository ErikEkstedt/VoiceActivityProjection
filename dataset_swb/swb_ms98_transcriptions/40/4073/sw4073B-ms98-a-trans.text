sw4073B-ms98-a-0012 51.112500 56.067125 something for the newspapers and something for the aluminum cans and

sw4073B-ms98-a-0015 73.204000 74.341875 [silence]
sw4073B-ms98-a-0016 74.341875 75.799375 of
sw4073B-ms98-a-0017 75.799375 78.898750 doing that but uh
sw4073B-ms98-a-0018 78.898750 86.983875 [silence]
sw4073B-ms98-a-0019 86.983875 88.340125 yeah
sw4073B-ms98-a-0020 88.340125 92.486000 [silence]
sw4073B-ms98-a-0021 92.486000 97.782750 and they just got rid of them well Kroger's uh at least in Dallas Kroger's
sw4073B-ms98-a-0022 97.782750 102.379000 will pay for aluminum and will collect
sw4073B-ms98-a-0023 102.379000 104.871500 the glass and the plastic
sw4073B-ms98-a-0024 104.871500 112.754500 but they don't collect newspaper and they don't collect tin cans and they don't collect cardboard
sw4073B-ms98-a-0025 112.754500 123.793250 and i know that the place at Galleria there is one bin in their loading dock area that's for cardboard only and they will recycle the cardboard from there
sw4073B-ms98-a-0026 123.793250 137.902250 so every once and a while after multiple birthdays and i have all these you know cardboard packaging stuff left over then i go and i recycle that over there but it's you know i have to run around town to get [laughter-my] [laughter-stuff] [laughter-recycled]
sw4073B-ms98-a-0027 137.902250 142.323500 [silence]
sw4073B-ms98-a-0028 142.323500 144.499375 yeah uh
sw4073B-ms98-a-0029 144.499375 149.957875 [silence]
sw4073B-ms98-a-0030 149.957875 159.850625 well i use to it use to be a good deal us to gi[ve]- instead of giving my kids an allowance i just told them they could go around the neighborhood and collect things to be recycled and then i would drive them over and
sw4073B-ms98-a-0031 159.850625 166.335875 they get some money and it was a good way to teach them that their work earned them
sw4073B-ms98-a-0032 166.335875 173.617625 some money and at the same time it was cleaning up the neighborhood and it was getting stuff recycled and
sw4073B-ms98-a-0033 173.617625 175.664875 but know it's just
sw4073B-ms98-a-0034 175.664875 182.449625 you know i can't do that because they don't earn any money for it and i hate to see that happen but
sw4073B-ms98-a-0035 182.449625 191.923875 you know and i would also i'd like to see the state you know they say on all sorts of things you know the they the diaper people advertise
sw4073B-ms98-a-0036 191.923875 204.435000 that diaper are recyclable and they are working on a program to recycle and well yeah in one small community they're recyclable but there is nothing around that will recycle that or recycle tires or recycle
sw4073B-ms98-a-0037 204.435000 216.634750 you know uh you know uh they say all these plastics are recyclable but nobody will take anything on beyond a two and so all the bags and all the stuff that's four or six doesn't get [laughter-recycled] 
sw4073B-ms98-a-0038 216.634750 224.710875 [silence]
sw4073B-ms98-a-0039 224.710875 233.668875 well or if it has to be separated by number why doesn't someone take it i mean i can't find it's i can't even find somewhere that will take the stuff
sw4073B-ms98-a-0040 233.668875 235.169000 [silence]
sw4073B-ms98-a-0041 235.169000 248.878750 yeah and i i think maybe one thing that we could do to encourage it would be to require uh you know government agencies and stuff were required to use only recycled paper for instance
sw4073B-ms98-a-0042 248.878750 254.495875 and to define recycle paper as paper that includes
sw4073B-ms98-a-0043 254.495875 255.928500 you know
sw4073B-ms98-a-0044 255.928500 257.003625 [silence]
sw4073B-ms98-a-0045 257.003625 260.922125 material that had actually been used as paper before
sw4073B-ms98-a-0046 260.922125 271.116625 one of the things that they do is that they call stuff recycled paper like when they when they make envelopes and stuff they had what they call mill ends
sw4073B-ms98-a-0047 271.116625 276.242000 you know the little the pieces from that they cut out from making the envelopes
sw4073B-ms98-a-0048 276.242000 287.767750 well that's what they are recycling cause that never had any ink on it that's what we usually send them to recycle it never had any ink on it they don't have to clean it they put that in with with fresh wood fiber
sw4073B-ms98-a-0049 287.767750 290.439875 and they call that recycled paper
sw4073B-ms98-a-0050 290.439875 296.204750 you know well then nobody wants to buy my newspaper and nobody wants to to figure out how to
sw4073B-ms98-a-0051 296.204750 297.593375 [silence]
sw4073B-ms98-a-0052 297.593375 299.074000 you know how to clean up [vocalized-noise]
