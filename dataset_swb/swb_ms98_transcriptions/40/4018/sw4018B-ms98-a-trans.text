sw4018B-ms98-a-0003 5.631875 11.821000 we have been working hard to get a program of recycling going
sw4018B-ms98-a-0004 11.821000 24.702625 the best we've been able to do is an area that has uh storage bins uh for um bottles and uh plastic
sw4018B-ms98-a-0005 24.702625 31.792875 but people need to drive it there we don't we haven't moved to having uh picked up with the garbage yet
sw4018B-ms98-a-0006 31.792875 73.721375 [silence]
sw4018B-ms98-a-0007 73.721375 79.449625 here uh they don't take uh lawn debris to the landfill any more
sw4018B-ms98-a-0008 79.449625 87.985625 we need to load it into cars and take it to a general site where it gets recycled uh but
sw4018B-ms98-a-0009 87.985625 96.257625 i think they're they're not making it easy for the uh general public to do it here i mean they they
sw4018B-ms98-a-0010 96.257625 106.444125 you have to haul everything yourself which can be a mess when it comes to uh yard waste in particular
sw4018B-ms98-a-0011 106.444125 111.893375 well we've got enough people we've got a community of about eighty five thousand
sw4018B-ms98-a-0012 111.893375 119.343125 but they're just very reluctant to to get moving the way in which i would like to see them moving
sw4018B-ms98-a-0013 119.343125 150.199000 [silence]
sw4018B-ms98-a-0014 150.199000 156.378625 um di[d]- di[d]- did you tell me that you're recycling newspapers
sw4018B-ms98-a-0015 156.378625 169.676375 [silence]
sw4018B-ms98-a-0016 169.676375 176.774250 boy you're you're further ahead here most people are recycling aluminum soda pop and beer cans
sw4018B-ms98-a-0017 176.774250 184.117625 uh for the money that they get out of them and that seems to be the only incentive on that side
sw4018B-ms98-a-0018 184.117625 197.926750 [silence]
sw4018B-ms98-a-0019 197.926750 202.738000 yeah it really is but there are a few people who who
sw4018B-ms98-a-0020 202.738000 212.232875 they will manage it what we've done at the church is to have uh people bring the stuff to our church
sw4018B-ms98-a-0021 212.232875 217.416750 and then there're couple of people who who crunch them down and then
sw4018B-ms98-a-0022 217.416750 227.119750 uh take them_1 to a recycling center and then the money is used for uh the outreach program to provide food
sw4018B-ms98-a-0023 227.119750 235.261500 and so that has been an incentive uh within uh our our particular church
sw4018B-ms98-a-0024 235.261500 241.209250 but newspapers the city doesn't want and none of the uh recycling
sw4018B-ms98-a-0025 241.209250 250.974875 places want them because they say that they're it costs them more to recycle than than they get out of them_1 so we're stuck with newspapers
sw4018B-ms98-a-0026 250.974875 298.562000 [silence]
