sw4038A-ms98-a-0042 202.745750 206.822250 oh how many members were on the jury was it a six or twelve member jury

sw4038A-ms98-a-0044 207.914250 215.144500 uh-huh that's kind of curious to me i didn't realize until the uh Wayne Kennedy Smith trial uh
sw4038A-ms98-a-0045 215.144500 223.238250 a few months ago that they had six member juries i thought that they you know it was always twelve twelve men tried and true so to speak
sw4038A-ms98-a-0046 223.238250 230.182250 but uh apparently for some some crimes it's permissible to have six people sit in judgment
sw4038A-ms98-a-0047 230.182250 231.476375 [silence]
sw4038A-ms98-a-0048 231.476375 245.699500 i know on a getting to this unanimous thing whether you know a jury should be unanimous or not or not in a court martial case it doesn't require the jury to be unanimous it's s[imple]- a simple majority you know rules
sw4038A-ms98-a-0049 245.699500 251.029875 yeah
sw4038A-ms98-a-0050 251.029875 256.591000 a probably on capital i don't know we weren't we [vocalized-noise] the two that i were on had to do with drugs
sw4038A-ms98-a-0051 256.591000 271.341875 and uh we were uh unanimous in acquitting the person even though we in our in our uh gut felt that the individuals were both guilty just because of the friends because of various things
sw4038A-ms98-a-0052 271.341875 283.373625 the government really failed to prove its case and you know being fair to the person if the government doesn't prove its case no matter how you feel you have to go by what's offered as proof and we had to acquit him in both cases
sw4038A-ms98-a-0053 283.373625 284.531000 [silence]
sw4038A-ms98-a-0054 284.531000 298.154000 uh yeah it was yeah in some of the critical things like the off special investigations at one time in one of the cases had videotaped this person but something happened to the camera and the tape and
sw4038A-ms98-a-0055 298.154000 299.842000 all they could do was testify about
