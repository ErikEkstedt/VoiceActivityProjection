sw4033B-ms98-a-0006 30.811375 33.675625 that's true i mean my roommates and stuff you know
sw4033B-ms98-a-0007 33.675625 39.540500 people around me talk about it and the people i work with are pretty you know up up-to-date on that kind of stuff so
sw4033B-ms98-a-0008 39.540500 41.251250 [silence]
sw4033B-ms98-a-0009 41.251250 42.624375 uh-huh

sw4033B-ms98-a-0012 48.520750 53.137500 [silence]
sw4033B-ms98-a-0013 53.137500 59.545125 do you watch do you watch the network like major network news or do you watch like the McNeil Lehrer Hour
sw4033B-ms98-a-0014 59.545125 61.051750 oh really
sw4033B-ms98-a-0015 61.051750 62.845625 [silence]
sw4033B-ms98-a-0016 62.845625 70.332750 uh-huh oh ch[annel]- see channel where i am channel eight's um like public TV so it's kind of different
sw4033B-ms98-a-0017 70.332750 71.333500 [silence]
sw4033B-ms98-a-0018 71.333500 74.108625 i think i think the uh
sw4033B-ms98-a-0019 74.108625 83.418000 i think a lot of the commentators on like the major networks like right it's kind of appropriate right now because of the election stuff going on but um it seems that um
sw4033B-ms98-a-0020 83.418000 88.411625 they kind of get to throw their opinions into how they you know report on the news
sw4033B-ms98-a-0021 88.411625 92.642125 [silence]
sw4033B-ms98-a-0022 92.642125 93.994250 yeah

sw4033B-ms98-a-0025 100.986625 105.553750 [silence]
sw4033B-ms98-a-0026 105.553750 115.320500 uh-huh uh because they can they can only report on i mean they give each candidate perhaps you know ten second blurbs in which to you know to say
sw4033B-ms98-a-0027 115.320500 122.542000 you you just can't get a full picture of you know their message unless you have time to sit down and r[ead]- and probably read something on it
sw4033B-ms98-a-0028 122.542000 130.578625 [silence]

sw4033B-ms98-a-0033 153.780125 167.166250 what kind of uh see i subscribe to like Science News and that's that's real good because it gives like a brief summary of all like the updates like of what's going on in science without getting into a lot of detail that would you know bog me down that i wouldn't know about
sw4033B-ms98-a-0034 167.166250 171.108375 but other than that i don't really r[ead]- i don't i don't really subscribe to anything else
sw4033B-ms98-a-0035 171.108375 172.517500 [silence]

sw4033B-ms98-a-0046 201.623875 210.045875 well i remember dur[ing]- back during the uh during the war everyone here at work always had the radio or the TV on because_1 that they were going constantly with that stuff
sw4033B-ms98-a-0047 210.045875 211.505625 but uh

sw4033B-ms98-a-0053 234.890000 242.344375 if they reported every m[urder]- if they reported every violent crime in Atlanta it would take it would probably take the whole news [laughter-hour] but uh
sw4033B-ms98-a-0054 242.344375 245.885250 [silence]
sw4033B-ms98-a-0055 245.885250 258.331750 oh yeah that's they still already they're having like um in the newspaper they have a section i think every now and then o[n]- on the Olympics you know and they've got like a countdown it's like sixteen hundred days or something
sw4033B-ms98-a-0056 258.331750 263.403750 oh really that's gonna be crazy that time of year here but uh
sw4033B-ms98-a-0057 263.403750 269.496875 i can't believe i mean they're they're uh stretching out the Olympic news for that much coverage over
sw4033B-ms98-a-0058 269.496875 279.044875 i guess people want to hear about it also big in big in the news right now is the Braves because they're uh they're in you know tr[aining]- spring training or whatever and they did so well last year
sw4033B-ms98-a-0059 279.044875 287.084375 [silence]
sw4033B-ms98-a-0060 287.084375 289.731375 yeah it seems like
sw4033B-ms98-a-0061 289.731375 298.754000 i don't know it's they way they do the newscasts uh i wish they they kind of separated it you know or [vocalized-noise] if you wanted to watch one thing you could turn to s[ome]- some channel for it but i don't have cable
