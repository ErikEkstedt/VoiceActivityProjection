sw4033A-ms98-a-0009 26.937375 32.004500 i would imagine going to college though your professors and different things you keep up on what's going on
sw4033A-ms98-a-0010 32.004500 33.272625 [silence]

sw4033A-ms98-a-0012 34.556250 38.975000 [silence]
sw4033A-ms98-a-0013 38.975000 49.439500 right well i'm a housewife i have three kids and so um i get most of my information probably through just the news at six o'clock and then um
sw4033A-ms98-a-0014 49.439500 54.472375 talking with people and just hearing what's going on but
sw4033A-ms98-a-0015 54.472375 57.126500 [silence]
sw4033A-ms98-a-0016 57.126500 63.447875 just the regular channel just channel eight that's our channel here that's the um eyewitness news
sw4033A-ms98-a-0017 63.447875 65.101250 so
sw4033A-ms98-a-0018 65.101250 69.635375 [silence]

sw4033A-ms98-a-0021 87.663250 96.995250 right and i think even in the elections they choose who they're going to follow and who they're not and basically you know if a c[andidate]- candidate can get them to follow then the news will
sw4033A-ms98-a-0022 96.995250 100.031625 you know kind of publicize his name
sw4033A-ms98-a-0023 100.031625 106.314125 i don't think that the way i get the news is the right way to get it i think you get a very lopsided picture of what's going on
