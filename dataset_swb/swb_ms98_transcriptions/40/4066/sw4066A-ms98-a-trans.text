sw4066A-ms98-a-0006 27.339750 39.014500 the people that are on death row and have been for years and years and years they're beginning to go on and executed them now We have the uh legal injections lethal injection

sw4066A-ms98-a-0008 40.257875 45.419625 it's going to take at least all ready this year three have been put to death
sw4066A-ms98-a-0009 45.419625 55.704375 and i think at this point i am for that as long you know as they've had all the chances they need to have on appeals and 
sw4066A-ms98-a-0010 55.704375 65.540375 this i don't see why they should have to and why why we should have to support them for twenty or thirty years on death row 
sw4066A-ms98-a-0011 65.540375 73.068125 that once they have been sentenced by a jury of their peers found guilty and then gone through the appeal

sw4066A-ms98-a-0040 202.160875 212.256375 uh i i guess i would feel strongly about that when it involves a child especially they they tied this [laughter-child] 
sw4066A-ms98-a-0041 212.256375 220.480000 the police found the child tied and starved and uh there's no doubt a case like that there's no doubt in my mind
sw4066A-ms98-a-0042 220.480000 223.234500 that these people ought to get the death penalty
