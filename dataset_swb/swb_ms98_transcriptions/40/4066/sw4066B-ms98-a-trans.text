sw4066B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.064750 [silence]
sw4066B-ms98-a-0002 0.064750 4.382125 i just just as i answered the phone there was there was a voice that came on the line and said [noise] 
sw4066B-ms98-a-0003 4.382125 15.455875 you were suppose to you talk about capital punishment how does the law what uh how do the laws in the different states compare and to be restricted to certain crimes or certain circumstances or something like that 
sw4066B-ms98-a-0004 15.455875 21.920250 i honestly don't know what Illinois' position on capital punishment is do you know for Texas
sw4066B-ms98-a-0005 21.920250 38.053000 [silence]
sw4066B-ms98-a-0006 38.053000 39.322750 uh-huh
sw4066B-ms98-a-0007 39.322750 76.394750 [silence]
sw4066B-ms98-a-0008 76.394750 88.712125 yeah i- i st[rongly]- i i strongly agree i think uh well in general i think we have we have a fairly lax legal system as far as protecting the criminal 
sw4066B-ms98-a-0009 88.712125 92.987000 and uh and i can see the the necessity of it
sw4066B-ms98-a-0010 92.987000 94.780750 but uh
sw4066B-ms98-a-0011 94.780750 108.701250 i don't know if someone's guilty and there's there's no que[stion]- if if if there's is no question about it a lot of times you sentence someone to prison and there and there the jury finds them guilt then n[ot]- in everyone's mind it's not actually settled
sw4066B-ms98-a-0012 108.701250 110.236250 [silence]
sw4066B-ms98-a-0013 110.236250 121.481750 so i can i can see letting uh letting for example the judge make the call or or maybe an appeals court make the call and on this it was this not just beyond a reasonable doubt but beyond any doubt
sw4066B-ms98-a-0014 121.481750 132.934250 and so under circumstances where it's you know where there is no question about it the person actually did kill somebody and in particularly particularly in some of the more brutal cases or prevalent or where they've killed several people 
sw4066B-ms98-a-0015 132.934250 141.061875 yeah i i totally agree i i think it's kind of appalling that some one can commit murder and they know that they probably won't die for it
sw4066B-ms98-a-0016 141.061875 153.941000 [silence]
sw4066B-ms98-a-0017 153.941000 155.288125 is that right
sw4066B-ms98-a-0018 155.288125 156.272000 oh wow
sw4066B-ms98-a-0019 156.272000 161.973500 [silence]
sw4066B-ms98-a-0020 161.973500 163.034375 [laughter]
sw4066B-ms98-a-0021 163.034375 164.051625 baby
sw4066B-ms98-a-0022 164.051625 165.203375 [silence]
sw4066B-ms98-a-0023 165.203375 170.622250 that's that's probably why this was picked as one of the topics because Texas Instruments is in Texas and so
sw4066B-ms98-a-0024 170.622250 175.393625 it's in the news it's not it's not really in the news much up here i guess it was the Dahlmer case 
sw4066B-ms98-a-0025 175.393625 177.664750 that that was in the news everywhere
sw4066B-ms98-a-0026 177.664750 179.294875 now where was that at
sw4066B-ms98-a-0027 179.294875 182.347250 [silence]
sw4066B-ms98-a-0028 182.347250 184.345125 so that was in Texas too
sw4066B-ms98-a-0029 184.345125 186.077250 that's what i thought
sw4066B-ms98-a-0030 186.077250 209.578000 [silence]
sw4066B-ms98-a-0031 209.578000 210.649250 uh-huh
sw4066B-ms98-a-0032 210.649250 228.342125 [silence]
sw4066B-ms98-a-0033 228.342125 232.663125 i guess that would be that would be the issue and they just tie the child and and 
sw4066B-ms98-a-0034 232.663125 237.404000 and were they were they punishing the kid and they didn't realize that he was going to die or oh they did 
sw4066B-ms98-a-0035 237.404000 244.526625 [silence]
sw4066B-ms98-a-0036 244.526625 248.813500 well see that's i think i would think that differently they had two of them
sw4066B-ms98-a-0037 248.813500 250.863250 two chi[ldren]- two children
sw4066B-ms98-a-0038 250.863250 251.904875 [silence]
sw4066B-ms98-a-0039 251.904875 252.953750 one didn't
sw4066B-ms98-a-0040 252.953750 253.660250 huh
sw4066B-ms98-a-0041 253.660250 259.637000 yeah in that case he i think he could argue that i don't know if the parents were really intending to kill the kids
sw4066B-ms98-a-0042 259.637000 261.230000 [silence]
sw4066B-ms98-a-0043 261.230000 267.400875 that would that would s[eem]- that would seem like that would that would i would have a harder time saying the death penalty was in order for that
sw4066B-ms98-a-0044 267.400875 270.699000 [silence]
sw4066B-ms98-a-0045 270.699000 271.788750 well
sw4066B-ms98-a-0046 271.788750 281.575000 no i- i certainly think punishment is in order but the death penalty because that's i am not sure that that's homicide because they didn't i i it's it was certainly wasn't intentional homicide 
sw4066B-ms98-a-0047 281.575000 292.716625 [silence]
sw4066B-ms98-a-0048 292.716625 294.242500 yeah that's
sw4066B-ms98-a-0049 294.242500 295.484750 that is
sw4066B-ms98-a-0050 295.484750 297.342875 that is a tough one
sw4066B-ms98-a-0051 297.342875 299.522000 [silence]
