sw4089A-ms98-a-0011 27.122125 33.419875 Atlanta's Atlanta's moderately bad um you know we have we have a big problem with ozone um
sw4089A-ms98-a-0012 33.419875 42.520625 and you know it's generally you know it's it it's quite often you know be a very hazy sort of day you know because there'll just be this pollution hanging in the air
sw4089A-ms98-a-0013 42.520625 44.288750 um
sw4089A-ms98-a-0014 44.288750 48.691625 i think a lot i think m[ost]- well i think most of our problems caused by automobile emissions

sw4089A-ms98-a-0024 66.612500 71.189000 of heavy industry yeah i think i think the [vocalized-noise] has been you know relatively good about
sw4089A-ms98-a-0025 71.189000 75.969125 um you know having regulations at least in the last twenty years or so about
sw4089A-ms98-a-0026 75.969125 90.375625 in[dustry]- industry pollution but it just seems that i th[ink]- i think i think we really suffer because you know we don't have any sort of an organized mass transit system any sort of you know like high speed rail or even you know even even you know decent regular passenger rail across the country
sw4089A-ms98-a-0027 90.375625 100.978000 um it seems it seems like like there's a l[ot]- you know there's a l[ot]- there's a lot more federal subsidies for automobile you know f[or]- through through the c[onstruction]- through the construction of highways for automobiles

sw4089A-ms98-a-0065 218.941125 230.544125 it's there there's some sort of rule i don't have a car so i don't know the actual specifics but it's like if you[r]- your car is if the ma[ke]- if the m[odel]- model year of your car is like more than twenty years old you don't have to have it inspected any more
sw4089A-ms98-a-0066 230.544125 235.173500 you know which is which is just kind of ludicrous you know because those are the ones that you'd expect to
sw4089A-ms98-a-0067 235.173500 237.891250 you know be the hardest be the m[ost]- biggest polluters

sw4089A-ms98-a-0077 291.004875 299.522000 i have heard on the news in the you know in the past couple of months or so that you know that apparently there's some federal guidelines for um smog and Atlanta's like it
