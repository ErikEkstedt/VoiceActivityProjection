sw4009A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.125625 it's recycling
sw4009A-ms98-a-0002 1.125625 16.032250 [silence]
sw4009A-ms98-a-0003 16.032250 18.799500 exactly i agree
sw4009A-ms98-a-0004 18.799500 28.527500 [silence]
sw4009A-ms98-a-0005 28.527500 39.988875 well you know i think it all depends on the consumer the more we uh demand from from the people that are producing these goods that they use recycled products the more you know innovative that they'll be
sw4009A-ms98-a-0006 39.988875 46.840250 [silence]
sw4009A-ms98-a-0007 46.840250 49.382500 there's not a market for it right
sw4009A-ms98-a-0008 49.382500 53.954750 [silence]
sw4009A-ms98-a-0009 53.954750 59.518875 yeah [noise] well uh do you have a recycling program where you live
sw4009A-ms98-a-0010 59.518875 65.597875 [silence]
sw4009A-ms98-a-0011 65.597875 69.240000 uh-huh [noise] do you have plastics and that kind o[f]- kind of stuff 
sw4009A-ms98-a-0012 69.240000 73.222000 [silence]
sw4009A-ms98-a-0013 73.222000 74.672125 uh-huh
sw4009A-ms98-a-0014 74.672125 76.266750 [silence]
sw4009A-ms98-a-0015 76.266750 79.439750 so this is like i[n]- within the school
sw4009A-ms98-a-0016 79.439750 81.444750 [silence]
sw4009A-ms98-a-0017 81.444750 84.056625 do they have curbside recycling
sw4009A-ms98-a-0018 84.056625 92.840875 that is nice see we don't have that here it's going that direction but it hasn't come yet at least to my area and uh and i'm really anxious to uh
sw4009A-ms98-a-0019 92.840875 101.626750 get that because i mean it's terr[ible]- it's really inconvenient for anybody to drive you know on the other side of town and bring all y[our]- lug all that stuff you know dirty
sw4009A-ms98-a-0020 101.626750 107.444500 you know things and and so i i think that a lot more people would do it if it was you know at their door
sw4009A-ms98-a-0021 107.444500 110.191750 [silence]
sw4009A-ms98-a-0022 110.191750 117.066250 well it really depends on the product and the place you go some some places will will pay you and some o[thers]- others won't
sw4009A-ms98-a-0023 117.066250 121.988250 so um it depends on you know um the demand for the product that you have
sw4009A-ms98-a-0024 121.988250 123.650500 [silence]
sw4009A-ms98-a-0025 123.650500 131.464250 [laughter] i'm on the recycling committee at work so everybody comes to me with all their questions so i try to know as much as possible
sw4009A-ms98-a-0026 131.464250 140.316625 but uh we just at work started recycling cans and um what else and paper you know office paper
sw4009A-ms98-a-0027 140.316625 147.286500 but we don't do you know we don't do plastics or glass and those are easily recycled products in a lot of cases
sw4009A-ms98-a-0028 147.286500 150.689000 but you know you know they have the little recycling triangle
sw4009A-ms98-a-0029 150.689000 155.024875 and some of those numbers in there mean that these products aren't really recyclable
sw4009A-ms98-a-0030 155.024875 161.645250 so that's kind of inconvenient as well why put recyclable if its in in seventy five percent of the recycling centers you can't recycle it
sw4009A-ms98-a-0031 161.645250 164.647750 [silence]
sw4009A-ms98-a-0032 164.647750 167.130250 yeah exactly
sw4009A-ms98-a-0033 167.130250 172.594750 um-hum yep well anything else
sw4009A-ms98-a-0034 172.594750 173.977250 [silence]
sw4009A-ms98-a-0035 173.977250 178.690250 well reduce reuse and recycle right [laughter]
sw4009A-ms98-a-0036 178.690250 184.266125 [laughter] that's right i try to remember them_1 i guess we've covered it
sw4009A-ms98-a-0037 184.266125 187.554250 [noise] it was nice talking to you bye-bye now
sw4009A-ms98-a-0038 187.554250 189.890000 [silence]
