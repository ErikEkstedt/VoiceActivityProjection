sw4049B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.513750 [noise]
sw4049B-ms98-a-0002 0.513750 6.786250 well uh i myself am not in favor of drug testing in the work place except in in specific uh
sw4049B-ms98-a-0003 6.786250 16.652250 very specific in this uh very specific examples such as uh transportation workers as in uh air traffic controllers bus drivers and that kind of thing
sw4049B-ms98-a-0004 16.652250 20.330625 um i don't really [noise] think that it's uh
sw4049B-ms98-a-0005 20.330625 33.074875 too many i think it's a severe invasion of somebody's privacy to say well we're going to look at your urine and then decide whether you're uh you know worthy of working for us i really don't see that that's a very very valid uh
sw4049B-ms98-a-0006 33.074875 40.272625 thing for a company to say and i personally i don't think i would work for somebody if they were going to reject me on the basis of what's inside my body
sw4049B-ms98-a-0007 40.272625 50.108250 [silence]
sw4049B-ms98-a-0008 50.108250 58.885625 well i think i think wh[at]- y[ou]- i think the problem here is is that a a drug test does not necessarily imply that someone is taking drugs or not taking drugs
sw4049B-ms98-a-0009 58.885625 70.106875 there's too many cases where it can you know there can be false positive results and that that sort of thing i don't think there's any definitive you know okay this person is taking drugs so we don't want him here
sw4049B-ms98-a-0010 70.106875 71.818250 uh
sw4049B-ms98-a-0011 71.818250 79.908375 like i said some industries though i think it'd be very necessary i wouldn't want any air traffic controllers high or anything like that when i'm flying in an airplane
sw4049B-ms98-a-0012 79.908375 93.078250 but uh i mean i just i find it to be pretty offensive that that it's such a a big deal i mean if your employer's not going to trust you or you know it i just i think it's a whole trust issue i just can't see it
sw4049B-ms98-a-0013 93.078250 96.993750 [silence]
sw4049B-ms98-a-0014 96.993750 98.977375 uh yeah i have been
sw4049B-ms98-a-0015 98.977375 100.284500 i
sw4049B-ms98-a-0016 100.284500 111.810250 uh i mean i was very offended by by the whole process i mean it's [vocalized-noise] it's very humiliating and i mean i'm not speaking in favor of drugs or against drugs but i uh i am totally against that sort of a uh 
sw4049B-ms98-a-0017 111.810250 117.337875 [laughter] i mean it's it's a pretty personal thing when somebody says i want to look at your urine before i'm going to talk to you
sw4049B-ms98-a-0018 117.337875 125.381875 [silence]
sw4049B-ms98-a-0019 125.381875 126.610875 right
sw4049B-ms98-a-0020 126.610875 130.206500 [silence]
sw4049B-ms98-a-0021 130.206500 131.390625 yeah
sw4049B-ms98-a-0022 131.390625 133.617750 [silence]
sw4049B-ms98-a-0023 133.617750 134.784875 right
sw4049B-ms98-a-0024 134.784875 139.006125 right that that's basically my opinion on it right there is that it's just
sw4049B-ms98-a-0025 139.006125 153.002500 [noise] you know i did i it was in the same sort of situation as it was a job interview and then you had a physical where you were drug tested and it's i just i mean i know people who have been drug tested and who have not you know
sw4049B-ms98-a-0026 153.002500 155.786250 been hired by a corporation
sw4049B-ms98-a-0027 155.786250 169.082250 which uh you know i really The other side of it is is besides its being an invasion of of personal privacy as in my it's my bodily fluid and i don't really want you to look at it or or something pretty basic like that just to the fact that
sw4049B-ms98-a-0028 169.082250 175.649000 i don't know that it is a company's business to regulate what it's employees are doing when they're not at work
sw4049B-ms98-a-0029 175.649000 189.240625 i mean the during the eight hours during the day when they're supposed to be there i think they have every right to say this is these behaviors are acceptable and these are not but when it enters into what they're doing when they're not at work i find that to be fairly offensive also
sw4049B-ms98-a-0030 189.240625 200.440250 [silence]
sw4049B-ms98-a-0031 200.440250 201.611000 right
sw4049B-ms98-a-0032 201.611000 203.009250 [silence]
sw4049B-ms98-a-0033 203.009250 204.294625 right
sw4049B-ms98-a-0034 204.294625 208.610000 [silence]
sw4049B-ms98-a-0035 208.610000 210.681500 that's exactly right
sw4049B-ms98-a-0036 210.681500 220.691250 and also i just think it it gets a lot i'm a big uh supporter of personal freedoms and personal privacies and i think that it just moves down along a line that
sw4049B-ms98-a-0037 220.691250 231.907750 that i really would find bad if if most people went down that line into regulating employees' lives outside of work when you know there's already talk of people well we're not going to hire you if you smoke
sw4049B-ms98-a-0038 231.907750 242.455250 well you know i i can see how they can say in the work place we you don't want them to smoke but when somebody leaves work i don't think that it's the employer's right to regulate their lifestyle at all
sw4049B-ms98-a-0039 242.455250 245.531375 [silence]
sw4049B-ms98-a-0040 245.531375 257.706000 uh i really think it should be except as i've mentioned twice now in the specified industries or or jobs because there are certain things where it's just vital that a person is clear minded at all times
sw4049B-ms98-a-0041 257.706000 264.309125 and other than that i think i do not think it should be allowable i think it should be illegal for them to to want to do that
sw4049B-ms98-a-0042 264.309125 270.384375 it should it's kind of the big brother syndrome [laughter] i mean i just anything like that just kind of scares me
sw4049B-ms98-a-0043 270.384375 287.965500 [silence]
sw4049B-ms98-a-0044 287.965500 289.347000 right
sw4049B-ms98-a-0045 289.347000 295.960625 [silence]
sw4049B-ms98-a-0046 295.960625 297.000000 right
