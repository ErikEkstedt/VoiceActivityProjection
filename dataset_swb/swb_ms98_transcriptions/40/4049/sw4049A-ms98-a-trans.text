sw4049A-ms98-a-0005 40.065500 46.421875 yeah uh i guess i basically agree that uh do you think it's okay for a company
sw4049A-ms98-a-0006 46.421875 52.332750 to reject somebody just knowing that they have take drugs i mean suppose they found out some other way
sw4049A-ms98-a-0007 52.332750 58.180500 [silence]

sw4049A-ms98-a-0015 98.346875 101.013125 yeah i have once too so
sw4049A-ms98-a-0016 101.013125 103.714750 [silence]
sw4049A-ms98-a-0017 103.714750 105.005375 yeah
sw4049A-ms98-a-0018 105.005375 116.619625 [silence]
sw4049A-ms98-a-0019 116.619625 119.713125 [vocalized-noise] yeah i had it during a job interview and
sw4049A-ms98-a-0020 119.713125 125.973750 i just thought it was dumb of the company at a point where they were trying to convince me to to want to work for them
sw4049A-ms98-a-0021 125.973750 130.710625 to do this and i'm just like well uh [laughter-i'm] not even going to think much about it
sw4049A-ms98-a-0022 130.710625 133.975125 if you're gonna treat me with this much respect even before
sw4049A-ms98-a-0023 133.975125 135.533750 you've gotten to know me

sw4049A-ms98-a-0026 167.254500 188.997250 [silence]
sw4049A-ms98-a-0027 188.997250 196.886250 yeah well like you say i mean if it's not a critical kind of job where someone could get hurt then really what people ought to be doing
sw4049A-ms98-a-0028 196.886250 203.655500 i mean the the employer ought to be judging you on how well you do your work rather than on these other factors
sw4049A-ms98-a-0029 203.655500 209.525625 and i mean if you are doing drugs and it's causing a problem then they'll notice it for other reasons
sw4049A-ms98-a-0030 209.525625 211.092250 yeah
sw4049A-ms98-a-0031 211.092250 231.619750 [silence]

sw4049A-ms98-a-0034 241.944750 246.297875 well do you think it's should be illegal for an employer to do this or
sw4049A-ms98-a-0035 246.297875 251.114750 [silence]
sw4049A-ms98-a-0036 251.114750 252.334000 yeah

sw4049A-ms98-a-0042 270.150500 272.923125 i tend to to view it
sw4049A-ms98-a-0043 272.923125 278.493125 even though i don't think i'd work for a company that did that i sort of want to defend
sw4049A-ms98-a-0044 278.493125 288.708125 an employer's rights as opposed to an in[dividual's]- uh in addition to an individual's rights but an employer really i think has the right to hire someone on any basis they want to
sw4049A-ms98-a-0045 288.708125 296.446875 and if they say they don't want smokers i sort of feel like an employer should have the right to decide whether they want to allow that
sw4049A-ms98-a-0046 296.446875 299.394000 uh and [vocalized-noise] i don't really
