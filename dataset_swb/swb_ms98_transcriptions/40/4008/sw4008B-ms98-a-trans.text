sw4008B-ms98-a-0010 36.909000 50.178625 well i do a lot of word processing and spread sheets and data base and uh about the only thing i am uh i'm just starting to get in into uh a little bit more communications now i've just uh today ordered a fax modem so i'll be able to 
sw4008B-ms98-a-0011 50.178625 55.119125 send and receive faxes right over there without using you know you don't have to make a hard copy that way
sw4008B-ms98-a-0012 55.119125 58.350125 uh are you using windows
sw4008B-ms98-a-0013 58.350125 62.749875 [silence]

sw4008B-ms98-a-0018 80.232750 91.501250 um-hum well the one thing i used to use a i've never used an IBM actually i used to use a just an Apple two E which of course is looks pretty primitive now
sw4008B-ms98-a-0019 91.501250 94.833375 [silence]
sw4008B-ms98-a-0020 94.833375 102.314000 but i don't have any uh any real programming capabilities on my uh Mac right now i don't have uh any compilers
sw4008B-ms98-a-0021 102.314000 105.562250 so i'm uh [noise] wa[nting]-
sw4008B-ms98-a-0022 105.562250 108.965625 [silence]
sw4008B-ms98-a-0023 108.965625 111.619125 i use it in my business
sw4008B-ms98-a-0024 111.619125 120.404125 i uh do uh consultation and and testing of various kinds for uh English as a second language programs
sw4008B-ms98-a-0025 120.404125 143.458750 [silence]
sw4008B-ms98-a-0026 143.458750 150.636500 that's uh exactly what yeah that's the kind of thing i'm working with exactly you seem to be uh better informed than the average person on that
sw4008B-ms98-a-0027 150.636500 164.471625 [silence]

sw4008B-ms98-a-0030 172.225375 182.186750 right well now we uh what i use a computer for is to write materials that are later printed though most of the stuff that i do is not uh interactive
sw4008B-ms98-a-0031 182.186750 186.616000 and then i use it for te[sting]- uh data analysis on testing so
sw4008B-ms98-a-0032 186.616000 188.518375 [silence]
sw4008B-ms98-a-0033 188.518375 194.085625 well just actually just uh item analysis statistical analysis of the tests uh
sw4008B-ms98-a-0034 194.085625 201.339125 you know when you when you write a test you have to look at some data from it and see how the different questions are performing
sw4008B-ms98-a-0035 201.339125 211.814000 and find out which ones are discriminating well and which ones aren't find out how reliable the test is you try correlate it with other tests and things of that sort so it's involves a lot of spread sheet use
sw4008B-ms98-a-0036 211.814000 217.413500 [silence]
sw4008B-ms98-a-0037 217.413500 225.983125 well i was doing some of the same stuff but doing it more slowly [laughter] and with smaller files [laughter] i can't believe you know i've got uh

sw4008B-ms98-a-0056 286.309625 297.450625 but i haven't upgraded it quite that far yet i think probably when i get system seven i may have to do that and and get another possibly another hard disk i don't know they say that system seven uses a lot of memory
