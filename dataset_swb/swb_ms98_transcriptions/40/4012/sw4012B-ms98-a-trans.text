sw4012B-ms98-a-0014 23.126875 33.423125 a necessary tool that uh needs to be used uh to establish justice in some cases and to that that it if used properly
sw4012B-ms98-a-0015 33.423125 38.210750 uh i think it can be uh it would it would be a useful deterrent
sw4012B-ms98-a-0016 38.210750 44.783000 [silence]
sw4012B-ms98-a-0017 44.783000 47.043875 yeah well i think that
sw4012B-ms98-a-0018 47.043875 49.483750 i think there are certain
sw4012B-ms98-a-0019 49.483750 54.382500 [noise] people in society that have no redeeming
sw4012B-ms98-a-0020 54.382500 62.378875 uh worth to them and that it's i[t]- it's a waste for society to continue to support those people those people should be
sw4012B-ms98-a-0021 62.378875 64.209125 you know disposed of
sw4012B-ms98-a-0022 64.209125 71.993500 [silence]
sw4012B-ms98-a-0023 71.993500 73.312625 that's right
sw4012B-ms98-a-0024 73.312625 89.196500 [silence]
sw4012B-ms98-a-0025 89.196500 90.699625 yeah
sw4012B-ms98-a-0026 90.699625 93.517625 that's right i mean they probably you know we
sw4012B-ms98-a-0027 93.517625 105.809375 the you know our our justice system is not designed to be either efficient or effective or just you know it it's designed
sw4012B-ms98-a-0028 105.809375 111.985500 as a set of artificial rules that you know judges and lawyers play with each other
sw4012B-ms98-a-0029 111.985500 137.926625 [silence]
sw4012B-ms98-a-0030 137.926625 142.087750 well it it it uh yeah but it you know the the problem is
sw4012B-ms98-a-0031 142.087750 143.212750 [silence]
sw4012B-ms98-a-0032 143.212750 146.380500 it whe[n]- when we administer it
sw4012B-ms98-a-0033 146.380500 159.545250 by you know i- i mean like like in Texas we have the death penalty right and they killed a guy a while back and you know he'd been in jail for twelve or fifteen years or something like that waiting
sw4012B-ms98-a-0034 159.545250 162.961500 uh you know w[aiting]- w[aiting]- w[aiting]- waiting his sentence
sw4012B-ms98-a-0035 162.961500 164.755750 wh[at]- wh[at]-
sw4012B-ms98-a-0036 164.755750 167.175000 there there's no point in it i mean
sw4012B-ms98-a-0037 167.175000 168.623000 [silence]
sw4012B-ms98-a-0038 168.623000 171.383625 well it it's be[cause]- it's because
sw4012B-ms98-a-0039 171.383625 172.534000 [silence]
sw4012B-ms98-a-0040 172.534000 175.876125 you know people don't wanna recognize
sw4012B-ms98-a-0041 175.876125 180.948375 how to make you know how to how to make a punishment effective
sw4012B-ms98-a-0042 180.948375 182.642250 i mean it
sw4012B-ms98-a-0043 182.642250 187.324875 punishing the person by killing them doesn't do anybody any good
sw4012B-ms98-a-0044 187.324875 194.396250 the only reas[on]- the only way it does some good is if it convi[nces]- convinces somebody else that they shouldn't do something like that
sw4012B-ms98-a-0045 194.396250 196.484125 [silence]
sw4012B-ms98-a-0046 196.484125 205.469875 and you know if the guy waits around ten or twenty years or whatever it is you know how is that a deterrent to anybody
sw4012B-ms98-a-0047 205.469875 209.053750 [silence]
sw4012B-ms98-a-0048 209.053750 211.579000 because the courts require it
sw4012B-ms98-a-0049 211.579000 219.313625 i mean they they they have said that well everybody has to have cer[tain]- you know has to have the the the right to appeal well
sw4012B-ms98-a-0050 219.313625 227.185875 but not only do they have the right to appeal they must appeal and you know they the the lawyers go in there and they generate
sw4012B-ms98-a-0051 227.185875 228.198750 [silence]
sw4012B-ms98-a-0052 228.198750 236.288125 well they generate all kinds of possible reasons that they might be able to appeal uh you know they they're they're trying to generate
sw4012B-ms98-a-0053 236.288125 246.484750 technicalities you know things which aren't really related to whether the guy did it or not but as to whether something in the process was right or wrong
sw4012B-ms98-a-0054 246.484750 247.767750 [silence]
sw4012B-ms98-a-0055 247.767750 252.869250 and you know it it it doesn't work you know our whole justice system doesn't work like that
sw4012B-ms98-a-0056 252.869250 265.196000 [silence]
