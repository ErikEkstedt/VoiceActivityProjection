sw4071A-ms98-a-0002 0.083750 11.555500 well Jackie uh on taxes i i'd guess i'd have to say that i my opinion is that i'd do think that Americans are paying too much in taxes uh what's your feeling about that
sw4071A-ms98-a-0003 11.555500 13.974625 [silence]
sw4071A-ms98-a-0004 13.974625 15.031500 right
sw4071A-ms98-a-0005 15.031500 16.283875 uh
sw4071A-ms98-a-0006 16.283875 20.987750 where you live do y[ou]- you have a state income tax and a sales tax both

sw4071A-ms98-a-0009 23.545000 32.218750 yeah in New Hampshire we have uh uh no no what we call broad base taxes no income tax and no sales tax
sw4071A-ms98-a-0010 32.218750 37.642000 uh we tax business uh eight percent businesses are taxed eight percent
sw4071A-ms98-a-0011 37.642000 43.141000 and we have uh what we call the five B's uh [vocalized-noise] for our taxes
sw4071A-ms98-a-0012 43.141000 53.468500 booze uh butts cigarettes beds uh hotel room tax bellies a meal tax and bets uh gambling
sw4071A-ms98-a-0013 53.468500 64.504000 so uh we do have a very low tax rate but you know combined with the federal income tax i think that Americans uh generally do pay in too too much in taxes [vocalized-noise]
sw4071A-ms98-a-0014 64.504000 78.495250 [silence]
sw4071A-ms98-a-0015 78.495250 79.606875 uh-huh
sw4071A-ms98-a-0016 79.606875 82.048500 [silence]

sw4071A-ms98-a-0022 96.827250 97.962750 [silence]
sw4071A-ms98-a-0023 97.962750 99.186000 yeah
sw4071A-ms98-a-0024 99.186000 111.365125 uh my my opinion of taxes is that when you send money to Washington or to the state and they say they're going to send some back it's like giving yourself a tra[nsfusion]- it's like one arm giving the other a transfusion
sw4071A-ms98-a-0025 111.365125 112.790750 you know what i mean
sw4071A-ms98-a-0026 112.790750 120.465250 uh it it really uh i should say one arm giving another arm a transfusion through a leaky tube because
sw4071A-ms98-a-0027 120.465250 131.326625 right because uh y[eah]- there's an old saying in in amongst taxes and politicians that uh there's a fly paper effect and that is that money tends to stick where it lands first
sw4071A-ms98-a-0028 131.326625 138.922000 and when you send it to Washington or send it to your state capitol uh a lot of it stays there and uh not that much comes back to you
sw4071A-ms98-a-0029 138.922000 140.168125 [silence]
sw4071A-ms98-a-0030 140.168125 141.715750 [noise]

sw4071A-ms98-a-0034 165.177625 166.968625 that's it
sw4071A-ms98-a-0035 166.968625 167.987250 [silence]
sw4071A-ms98-a-0036 167.987250 168.847750 um-hum
sw4071A-ms98-a-0037 168.847750 172.433000 [silence]
sw4071A-ms98-a-0038 172.433000 179.957125 well it does it it it it does seem that uh the more taxes that are raised the more the politicians spend
sw4071A-ms98-a-0039 179.957125 186.845625 uh it's almost like they'll spend as much as the they were were they're allowed to collect you know
sw4071A-ms98-a-0040 186.845625 194.979750 um [noise] i there's an interesting proposal that's been uh going around now for a few years of having a flat tax
sw4071A-ms98-a-0041 194.979750 203.547875 uh ten percent or thirteen percent there would be no figuring i mean you would take your income tax you'd have a certain amou[nt]- i mean you you take your total salary
sw4071A-ms98-a-0042 203.547875 211.683625 uh those who made under a certain amount wouldn't h[ave]- owe any taxes and then there'd be a set amount for however many people you know dependents you had
sw4071A-ms98-a-0043 211.683625 221.102500 and you would just pay a flat tax no exemptions no deductions or anything else after y[ou]- you know after you uh figure out [noise] you know who's in your family
sw4071A-ms98-a-0044 221.102500 229.295875 and that would eliminate a lot of the bureaucracy in the IRS and it would eliminate all these loop holes that the fat cats get away with you know
sw4071A-ms98-a-0045 229.295875 230.875750 yeah
sw4071A-ms98-a-0046 230.875750 240.546250 i i'd like to see something like that yeah i think it would be fairer and uh it would put a l[ot]- you know a lot of the tax attorneys out of business and i'm sure they'll fight it tooth and nail but
sw4071A-ms98-a-0047 240.546250 245.076000 i really think a flat tax would be a lot fairer for all Americans
sw4071A-ms98-a-0048 245.076000 258.387625 [noise] i mean it doesn't seem right that somebody that makes twenty five or thirty thousand dollars pays four five thousand dollars in taxes while somebody that makes uh two hundred and fifty thousand dollars might pay nothing in taxes
sw4071A-ms98-a-0049 258.387625 259.740250 [silence]
sw4071A-ms98-a-0050 259.740250 261.494375 doesn't seem fair to me
sw4071A-ms98-a-0051 261.494375 265.033250 [silence]
sw4071A-ms98-a-0052 265.033250 266.401875 right
sw4071A-ms98-a-0053 266.401875 268.266250 [silence]
sw4071A-ms98-a-0054 268.266250 273.063250 right i think your taxes in Wisconsin are pretty high i- i- if i'm not mistaken aren't they
sw4071A-ms98-a-0055 273.063250 276.881500 i mean for your state what is do you know what your state income tax rate is
sw4071A-ms98-a-0056 276.881500 278.272625 twenty percent
sw4071A-ms98-a-0057 278.272625 280.059125 [silence]
sw4071A-ms98-a-0058 280.059125 281.263500 just
sw4071A-ms98-a-0059 281.263500 283.766125 you just pay it huh [laughter]
sw4071A-ms98-a-0060 283.766125 285.550250 [vocalized-noise] 
sw4071A-ms98-a-0061 285.550250 299.170000 you're like you're like my daughter who's in in college down in Massachusetts and uh she works as a waitress and she's attending college full time also and she sends her taxes to me and i figure them out she really has no idea she gets a refund check and
