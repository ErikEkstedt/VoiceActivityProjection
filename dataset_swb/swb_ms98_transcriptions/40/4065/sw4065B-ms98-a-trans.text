sw4065B-ms98-a-0002 4.440000 15.073500 well i- i think my feelings on it are it depends i think if it's necessary if you have the kind of job that it it requires you to always be
sw4065B-ms98-a-0003 15.073500 24.571875 you know like police officers firemen doctors anybody who has you know who's impor[tant]- whose decisions are important and [vocalized-noise] you know that's
sw4065B-ms98-a-0004 24.571875 30.675375 that's what i think as far as you are required to not only be at work when you're not at work
sw4065B-ms98-a-0005 30.675375 34.192875 as it were you know what i'm saying if you if if
sw4065B-ms98-a-0006 34.192875 42.924125 yeah people who who could be at work at any time or whose decisions could be clouded if they had to make a decision
sw4065B-ms98-a-0007 42.924125 47.317500 when they aren't at work but i don't see the point in it if you're
sw4065B-ms98-a-0008 47.317500 52.352250 if you're putting something together down at the local pizza place or whatever
sw4065B-ms98-a-0009 52.352250 57.119500 then i'd uh i just don't see what merits you're going to have from gaining 
sw4065B-ms98-a-0010 57.119500 63.706250 what you do when you're not at work in those situations is your own business i think i think that's an infringement upon your personal rights
sw4065B-ms98-a-0011 63.706250 66.313625 that's an invasion of your personal privacy that's
sw4065B-ms98-a-0012 66.313625 74.045000 if they were to decide that you shouldn't be drinking w[ould]- would they just you know i mean y[ou]- you have to draw the line somewhere i think and give people
sw4065B-ms98-a-0013 74.045000 77.559375 the right to do what they need to do what they want to do

sw4065B-ms98-a-0016 90.392500 102.614500 you should you know i mean if you want to weed out those kind of people right from the start i have no problem with that because you don't you don't want somebody who's a drug user starting work for you but i don't i don't think that they can just

sw4065B-ms98-a-0043 197.868125 205.345625 yeah exactly you don't want your doctor coming in hung over if he's gonna be cutting on you that day that's for sure so
sw4065B-ms98-a-0044 205.345625 211.913875 uh yeah that is difficult you're gonna you can't but then that just kind of comes back to personal responsibility
sw4065B-ms98-a-0045 211.913875 217.004250 you but i guess that's [laughter] more or less forcing you to be personally responsible for yourself
sw4065B-ms98-a-0046 217.004250 230.201750 it's basically all they're trying to do with that then if you want to [vocalized-noise] if you look at it that way because you would think your doctor wouldn't be out drinking the night before but but if he thought he could get caught doing it then he certainly wouldn't do it as opposed to well
sw4065B-ms98-a-0047 230.201750 235.786750 it's not a big operation tomorrow what the heck or [laughter-something] [laughter] you kn[ow]- [noise]

sw4065B-ms98-a-0051 272.920625 285.563250 that was yeah wasn't yeah that's i don't know i- i kind of think well it's partially because we have the technology now but it's also because i think moral standards have [laughter-gone] downhill quite a bit since 
sw4065B-ms98-a-0052 285.563250 291.787875 earlier you know i mean it's just it's just reached that point where society accepts
sw4065B-ms98-a-0053 291.787875 299.074000 you know you don't think about seeing your doctor out at a bar anymore whereas you know nineteen forty doctor so and so
