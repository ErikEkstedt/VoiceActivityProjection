sw4082B-ms98-a-0008 60.875250 64.258125 [silence]

sw4082B-ms98-a-0010 70.124375 97.200250 [silence]

sw4082B-ms98-a-0012 103.661500 105.548375 uh
sw4082B-ms98-a-0013 105.548375 109.369875 [noise] uh i don't know how to how to describe it um [vocalized-noise]
sw4082B-ms98-a-0014 109.369875 118.401750 [noise] so it's a religious newspaper which which talks about issues that are relevant to me in a more broad sense it's a weekly [noise] but uh but not um
sw4082B-ms98-a-0015 118.401750 131.812625 but not like Business Week or uh or News Week or or or one of those kinds of things i i'd like to say that however um that i'm overwhelmingly disappointed with the media in general except for the raw news wires
sw4082B-ms98-a-0016 131.812625 140.322250 [silence]
sw4082B-ms98-a-0017 140.322250 145.489750 [noise] um i- i think that it i think it has to do with [noise] uh [noise]
sw4082B-ms98-a-0018 145.489750 153.033125 [noise] i personally think [noise] i i have a problem with their viewpoint and i personally think that uh [noise] that there's a strong bi[as]-
sw4082B-ms98-a-0019 153.033125 156.889750 there's a strong there's a strong bias in the media
sw4082B-ms98-a-0020 156.889750 165.458875 yeah absolutely a[fter]- after all wh[o]- who who writes are people are journalist who are trained to write and they're that's a liberal
sw4082B-ms98-a-0021 165.458875 174.092875 [noise] uh a liberal field at least from academia and uh the other thing that i always notice is that whenever they write about something that i'm
sw4082B-ms98-a-0022 174.092875 178.232375 an expert in i find their descriptions to be
sw4082B-ms98-a-0023 178.232375 179.757875 wrong
sw4082B-ms98-a-0024 179.757875 181.266375 and
sw4082B-ms98-a-0025 181.266375 182.690375 it
sw4082B-ms98-a-0026 182.690375 194.717375 that's right well even if it's not technical if it's um social thing or or whatever it doesn't matter if i'm expert in it they usually make mistakes which leads me to believe that the things i'm not expert in that they're telling me lies
sw4082B-ms98-a-0027 194.717375 200.481625 [silence]
sw4082B-ms98-a-0028 200.481625 214.491625 [noise] i- i think both uh by deliberate um [vocalized-noise] i mean mist[akes]- mistakes of omission or uh [noise] or uh bias toward the particular viewpoint particular liberal view point that they have
sw4082B-ms98-a-0029 214.491625 226.902625 [noise] so uh uh well give an example uh y[ou]- y[ou]- we'll go out of the printing media i know of cases where um for example in television media where they'll show clippings from
sw4082B-ms98-a-0030 226.902625 235.385625 one event and describe another event but with the attempt to give you the impression that what they're talking about is the same thing that they're showing you
sw4082B-ms98-a-0031 235.385625 242.772125 which is sort of like a deliberate bias um which is which is rather disturbing i know ABC does that
sw4082B-ms98-a-0032 242.772125 252.705500 [silence]
sw4082B-ms98-a-0033 252.705500 259.150750 yeah i don't have access either although i did at one time and uh it wa[s]- i did during the Gulf War and it was addictive
sw4082B-ms98-a-0034 259.150750 281.455125 [silence]
sw4082B-ms98-a-0035 281.455125 291.360625 [noise] yeah well during that small sample i would say that everyone was just about just about the same except the three networks who also had radio then television programming so if at a particular time you wanted to get
sw4082B-ms98-a-0036 291.360625 297.538000 the latest and greatest news you could do that by um turning on CNN and you w[ould]-
