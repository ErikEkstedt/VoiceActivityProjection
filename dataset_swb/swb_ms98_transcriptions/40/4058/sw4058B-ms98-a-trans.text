sw4058B-ms98-a-0002 0.588250 11.491625 [silence]
sw4058B-ms98-a-0003 11.491625 19.354500 well my position in general is that i'm supportive of it but i'm not supportive of the way that it's currently administered
sw4058B-ms98-a-0004 19.354500 21.315750 um [noise]
sw4058B-ms98-a-0005 21.315750 35.557375 it takes so long with uh the appeals process uh that it's uh uh simply impossible to say that it's that it's consistent administration of justice uh
sw4058B-ms98-a-0006 35.557375 45.826500 if if the penalty could be executed swiftly and surely upon people who deserved it when there was uh evidence uh beyond a
sw4058B-ms98-a-0007 45.826500 51.868625 a reasonable doubt that they had committed a a crime worthy of it then i think it should be done
sw4058B-ms98-a-0008 51.868625 54.466625 [silence]
sw4058B-ms98-a-0009 54.466625 68.943250 that's right but as it stands now it's not a deterrent we just had a fellow here in our county who has he's been on death row for seventeen years and just had his sentence overturned for the third time uh on a technicality
sw4058B-ms98-a-0010 68.943250 70.758250 everybody knows he did it
sw4058B-ms98-a-0011 70.758250 84.852625 this last technicality was simply because the language of the decision handed down by the jury uh ex[plaining]- uh saying that he should get the death penalty was not precisely as it is stated in the statute that it should be
sw4058B-ms98-a-0012 84.852625 95.707375 and that was it i mean it was a a very simple i mean they fully intended to give him the death penalty uh they had a unanimous decision but when they drafted the uh decision
sw4058B-ms98-a-0013 95.707375 100.821625 uh [noise] they did it wrong [laughter] and it was just a very minor
sw4058B-ms98-a-0014 100.821625 114.120625 very minor uh mistake but it was enough for uh the state supreme court to say that the uh that the decision was invalid and that they had to empanel a new jury to consider the death penalty again
sw4058B-ms98-a-0015 114.120625 121.826875 that kind of thing uh and and and the way that people search and search for those kind of things just uh just disgusts me
sw4058B-ms98-a-0016 121.826875 123.629500 and with [noise]
sw4058B-ms98-a-0017 123.629500 126.742125 uh with with it being that way
sw4058B-ms98-a-0018 126.742125 137.620000 it ends up costing us so much money so much more to have the death penalty than to not have it that uh i'm almost inclined to say do away with it
sw4058B-ms98-a-0019 137.620000 141.744375 the the problem that i see is uh what do we have instead
sw4058B-ms98-a-0020 141.744375 150.063625 here in Georgia uh we don't have a a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole
sw4058B-ms98-a-0021 150.063625 155.042625 if someone gets life in prison they are generally released in seven years if they behave well
sw4058B-ms98-a-0022 155.042625 159.989125 and we have had people get out in seven years and commit uh another murder
sw4058B-ms98-a-0023 159.989125 161.248125 uh
sw4058B-ms98-a-0024 161.248125 170.657750 that just shouldn't be so [vocalized-noise] but [vocalized-noise] so i say uh you know i could tolerate getting rid of the death penalty if we could have life without the possibility of parole
