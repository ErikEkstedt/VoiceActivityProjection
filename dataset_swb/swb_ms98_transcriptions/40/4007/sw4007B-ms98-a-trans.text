sw4007B-ms98-a-0003 4.144000 9.687500 [laughter] well i've got two kids one of them_1's a year old and one of them_1's going on three
sw4007B-ms98-a-0004 9.687500 20.224125 and in California anyways where i'm located my husband's in the Navy it's really hard to find child care around here because most people that are around here
sw4007B-ms98-a-0005 20.224125 24.731625 they're either Mexican or Filipino and they don't speak English
sw4007B-ms98-a-0006 24.731625 28.516125 so it's like my kids pick up really funny words
sw4007B-ms98-a-0007 28.516125 32.779875 and they come home and say something to me and i don't understand what they're [laughter-saying]
sw4007B-ms98-a-0008 32.779875 38.086375 and it's like i mean day care is really expensive it costs like three hundred dollars
sw4007B-ms98-a-0009 38.086375 46.254875 for day care for two kids for a month and when they come home i don't even understand half the stuff they're [laughter-saying]
sw4007B-ms98-a-0010 46.254875 51.079625 [silence]
sw4007B-ms98-a-0011 51.079625 52.522250 um
sw4007B-ms98-a-0012 52.522250 54.038250 sometimes
sw4007B-ms98-a-0013 54.038250 55.038500 [silence]
sw4007B-ms98-a-0014 55.038500 56.248250 yeah
sw4007B-ms98-a-0015 56.248250 60.217125 [silence]
sw4007B-ms98-a-0016 60.217125 71.241250 like one day he came home and said something and i asked him what he was saying i told him to point to it so i could understand what he was saying and he was talking about the cartoon you know Peter Pan
sw4007B-ms98-a-0017 71.241250 80.571250 but he said it you know in i- i don't even re[member]- i don't i don't even know which one it was it was either Spanish or Filipino i'm not even sure which language it was
sw4007B-ms98-a-0018 80.571250 84.447875 but he knew it was Peter Pan it's just he didn't say Peter Pan
sw4007B-ms98-a-0019 84.447875 87.596750 and so it's kind of hard to understand what they're saying
sw4007B-ms98-a-0020 87.596750 91.884250 but i don't wanna tell him not to say it because there's nothing wrong with it
sw4007B-ms98-a-0021 91.884250 95.009000 it's just [laughter] makes it hard to [laughter-understand]
sw4007B-ms98-a-0022 95.009000 99.859250 [silence]
sw4007B-ms98-a-0023 99.859250 101.304750 yeah

sw4007B-ms98-a-0028 140.647625 152.361750 [silence]
sw4007B-ms98-a-0029 152.361750 157.848000 yeah and actually having conversations instead of one line sentences [laughter]
sw4007B-ms98-a-0030 157.848000 161.642000 [silence]
sw4007B-ms98-a-0031 161.642000 163.941250 really
sw4007B-ms98-a-0032 163.941250 178.985750 [silence]
sw4007B-ms98-a-0033 178.985750 186.976375 yeah my husband and i made a deal when our second son was born because we had i had to work
sw4007B-ms98-a-0034 186.976375 190.866125 there was after our second son was born there wasn't any choice i had to work
sw4007B-ms98-a-0035 190.866125 195.796250 so we made a deal he's in the Navy and six months out of the year he's gone on a ship
sw4007B-ms98-a-0036 195.796250 199.497000 so for those six months i don't work i stay home with the kids
sw4007B-ms98-a-0037 199.497000 206.460250 but while he's in dock and he's you know on shore duty for six months then i work in the daytime
sw4007B-ms98-a-0038 206.460250 212.256500 and we have child care for them it's only six months out of the year but still it
sw4007B-ms98-a-0039 212.256500 222.251125 it's just it's kind of weird because the quality of day care is different than what i'm used to because i'm i'm originally from Arizona yeah really
sw4007B-ms98-a-0040 222.251125 224.007375 [noise] Mayer

sw4007B-ms98-a-0042 226.441250 229.804500 yeah a little tiny dinky town up by Prescott [laughter]
sw4007B-ms98-a-0043 229.804500 233.448750 but um it's really strange because
sw4007B-ms98-a-0044 233.448750 243.828000 i'm used to just going to my next door neighbor and she babysat me and you know when i first had when we first had our first son she babysat him until we moved and
sw4007B-ms98-a-0045 243.828000 245.881500 it's really different here
sw4007B-ms98-a-0046 245.881500 248.689125 [silence]
sw4007B-ms98-a-0047 248.689125 252.428875 yeah {moneywise} and you don't know them_1 and you're worried you know
sw4007B-ms98-a-0048 252.428875 253.472875 [silence]
sw4007B-ms98-a-0049 253.472875 263.866000 i mean i know a lot of people say well it never happens to you it just happens to other people when children disappear but it's still scary when you have to look for day care
sw4007B-ms98-a-0050 263.866000 266.228375 you know you always have that fear
sw4007B-ms98-a-0051 266.228375 269.723125 i got to find somebody r[eally]- you know really that i can depend on

sw4007B-ms98-a-0056 293.855000 298.466000 it's i'm just kind of paranoid as a mother it's like [laughter] i want my child safe
