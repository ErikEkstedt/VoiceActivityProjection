sw4087A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.599625 [noise] well do you have children
sw4087A-ms98-a-0002 1.599625 3.345625 you don't have children
sw4087A-ms98-a-0003 3.345625 7.020625 and my children are in their twenties now so
sw4087A-ms98-a-0004 7.020625 13.322500 child care is something that i- i no longer fortunately have to take care of but it is something that was hard
sw4087A-ms98-a-0005 13.322500 16.740250 at the time just finding finding sitters i
sw4087A-ms98-a-0006 16.740250 19.908250 did not work though so i didn't have to uh
sw4087A-ms98-a-0007 19.908250 22.535750 have to worry about you know
sw4087A-ms98-a-0008 22.535750 26.016500 all day during the day which i think is a real problem
sw4087A-ms98-a-0009 26.016500 55.030500 [silence]
sw4087A-ms98-a-0010 55.030500 56.523500 uh-huh
sw4087A-ms98-a-0011 56.523500 69.235000 [silence]
sw4087A-ms98-a-0012 69.235000 70.932250 oh boy
sw4087A-ms98-a-0013 70.932250 77.394375 [silence]
sw4087A-ms98-a-0014 77.394375 82.259500 no it's really scary and there does seem to be more and more of that if people are doing it
sw4087A-ms98-a-0015 82.259500 85.657625 instead of grandmothers and aunts and you know
sw4087A-ms98-a-0016 85.657625 89.108000 that kind of thing where where people are doing it for money
sw4087A-ms98-a-0017 89.108000 94.346500 and trying to make ends meet then it's it it becomes an entirely different thing
sw4087A-ms98-a-0018 94.346500 99.906750 and you we keep reading about all these different things that go on child abuse and 
sw4087A-ms98-a-0019 99.906750 104.151750 people with criminal records etcetera i think it would be very frightening 
sw4087A-ms98-a-0020 104.151750 110.830750 and i know some companies have child care facilities at the company but not many of them do
sw4087A-ms98-a-0021 110.830750 114.259125 [silence]
sw4087A-ms98-a-0022 114.259125 115.608375 yeah
sw4087A-ms98-a-0023 115.608375 122.189250 [silence]
sw4087A-ms98-a-0024 122.189250 124.346000 do you know how much it is
sw4087A-ms98-a-0025 124.346000 126.068000 yeah
sw4087A-ms98-a-0026 126.068000 131.904875 yeah but that's what i've heard is that that you've got to earn an awful lot i mean you know
sw4087A-ms98-a-0027 131.904875 137.719125 a lot of times the wife's money basically covers what you have to pay out so that doesn't help
sw4087A-ms98-a-0028 137.719125 141.977000 [silence]
sw4087A-ms98-a-0029 141.977000 144.372250 uh-huh uh-huh
sw4087A-ms98-a-0030 144.372250 150.750250 yeah [noise] that's right well i- i and and uh and then there's the question of you know if
sw4087A-ms98-a-0031 150.750250 154.677125 what what to look for what's what's going to be uh what's going to be
sw4087A-ms98-a-0032 154.677125 158.397250 a good place and uh do they
sw4087A-ms98-a-0033 158.397250 165.016250 do they turn out as well as the ones where the mother stays home that's that's a really difficult issue i know
sw4087A-ms98-a-0034 165.016250 174.047875 [silence]
sw4087A-ms98-a-0035 174.047875 175.472375 uh-huh
sw4087A-ms98-a-0036 175.472375 178.277500 y[ou]- you haven't decided yet huh 
sw4087A-ms98-a-0037 178.277500 182.962125 no i think it's going to be hard i feel like i was i was lucky to get to be at home and
sw4087A-ms98-a-0038 182.962125 188.913625 there were a lot of times that it was boring and it and it certainly isn't true is true that didn't [vocalized-noise]
sw4087A-ms98-a-0039 188.913625 194.069500 didn't set me up for a career but at the same time uh
sw4087A-ms98-a-0040 194.069500 197.221750 it felt good to be there when they got home from school
sw4087A-ms98-a-0041 197.221750 199.411125 um those were the stories that 
sw4087A-ms98-a-0042 199.411125 204.069500 that that i got to hear it was even hard to get their father to
sw4087A-ms98-a-0043 204.069500 207.664875 get to hear them you know they would come home and they'd say all this and then
sw4087A-ms98-a-0044 207.664875 214.168500 later on you say well tell dad about you know and they go oh i already told you you know it all gone kind of thing
sw4087A-ms98-a-0045 214.168500 219.471750 oh and that parts good and you get to see them as they progress etcetera
sw4087A-ms98-a-0046 219.471750 224.536500 but at the same time if you don't have enough money or if you are trying to build a career
sw4087A-ms98-a-0047 224.536500 230.535375 you know then you have to give everything up just to stay home and i think that's a a real question 
sw4087A-ms98-a-0048 230.535375 232.517375 [silence]
sw4087A-ms98-a-0049 232.517375 235.854750 and uh do you know uh

sw4087A-ms98-a-0057 260.125000 268.436875 [silence]
