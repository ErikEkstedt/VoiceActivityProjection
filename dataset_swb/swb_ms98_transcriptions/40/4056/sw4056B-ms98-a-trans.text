sw4056B-ms98-a-0010 27.908625 39.815625 our benefits package isn't uh isn't quite as good in in some ways uh you know overall i'm satisfied with it we don't have the vision care we do have the health care and the uh and the medi[cal]- or the dental
sw4056B-ms98-a-0011 39.815625 41.756250 uh [vocalized-noise]

sw4056B-ms98-a-0013 51.952750 59.724250 uh so the uh the the benefits uh probably the main thing i like about the benefits is the uh
sw4056B-ms98-a-0014 59.724250 64.293125 the uh very generous vacation time and sick time we get
sw4056B-ms98-a-0015 64.293125 74.316250 we get we get fifteen days a year sick time and uh we get twenty four days a year right from the day one when you start work you get twenty four days a year uh time off

sw4056B-ms98-a-0025 111.400625 119.664500 well i think uh the the health care of course is is an important in has to be the single most important benefit 
sw4056B-ms98-a-0026 119.664500 125.107250 and uh the rates that we keep paying seem to keep increasing uh
sw4056B-ms98-a-0027 125.107250 135.506500 you know i'm i'm a little disturbed about that but i think that's a national trend and i don't know that uh i don't know what the solution is to it it's bigger than just the benefits part

sw4056B-ms98-a-0048 201.281875 213.654000 well we have two different plans that we can subscribe to under dental uh depending and and the cost between them is very is very little i think it costs me something like five dollars a a month for the dental plan
sw4056B-ms98-a-0049 213.654000 221.915375 but it pays uh a substantial amount i mean the examinations and and uh checkups every year or every six months are free
sw4056B-ms98-a-0050 221.915375 226.507750 and uh it it covers the bulk of the dental expenses
sw4056B-ms98-a-0051 226.507750 235.102125 [silence]
sw4056B-ms98-a-0052 235.102125 241.994875 uh yes it is the the benefits plan is different for operat[ing]- for what we call operating staff which are
sw4056B-ms98-a-0053 241.994875 250.288875 considered to be uh clerical personnel accountants things like that as opposed to what they call the P A T staff which i belong to
sw4056B-ms98-a-0054 250.288875 257.036875 and but the main i think the hea[lth]- the health and all that and the dental is the same for everybody and the retirement plan but 
sw4056B-ms98-a-0055 257.036875 262.467125 the main difference is in the uh the way sick time is accrued and and vacation time is accrued
sw4056B-ms98-a-0056 262.467125 268.696000 uh for the operating staff it's on a seniority it's uh you know based on how long they've worked there
sw4056B-ms98-a-0057 268.696000 271.980500 uh that determines how much uh vacation time they get
sw4056B-ms98-a-0058 271.980500 276.630500 [silence]
sw4056B-ms98-a-0059 276.630500 277.796625 um-hum
