sw4056A-ms98-a-0002 0.252125 2.001500 okay should begin
sw4056A-ms98-a-0003 2.001500 3.189125 uh
sw4056A-ms98-a-0004 3.189125 7.051250 i can begin this um basically i work for Honeywell in Minneapolis
sw4056A-ms98-a-0005 7.051250 16.156000 and the the benefit program we have here is really quite good i'm i'm pretty pleased with it they cover uh just about everything vision dental medical
sw4056A-ms98-a-0006 16.156000 23.406250 uh you name it and for me this is the first job i've had where they've covered that much so i'm pretty satisfied myself
sw4056A-ms98-a-0007 23.406250 25.495875 um what's your situation
sw4056A-ms98-a-0008 25.495875 26.889625 [silence]
sw4056A-ms98-a-0009 26.889625 27.988250 oh
sw4056A-ms98-a-0010 27.988250 39.183750 [silence]
sw4056A-ms98-a-0011 39.183750 40.500375 um-hum
sw4056A-ms98-a-0012 40.500375 42.414000 are you a professor there
sw4056A-ms98-a-0013 42.414000 50.476625 [silence]
sw4056A-ms98-a-0014 50.476625 52.980000 oh i see okay
sw4056A-ms98-a-0015 52.980000 63.005000 [silence]
sw4056A-ms98-a-0016 63.005000 65.472125 oh no doubt [laughter]
sw4056A-ms98-a-0017 65.472125 73.704875 [silence]
sw4056A-ms98-a-0018 73.704875 79.674500 right oh that's good yeah that's one of the things i guess i would change about Honeywell is uh
sw4056A-ms98-a-0019 79.674500 80.694750 [silence]
sw4056A-ms98-a-0020 80.694750 84.707625 i used to work with the Army Research Institute and being a uh
sw4056A-ms98-a-0021 84.707625 88.149875 a government organization you got quite a few holidays off
sw4056A-ms98-a-0022 88.149875 91.996875 but here you don't get that you maybe get two or three a year
sw4056A-ms98-a-0023 91.996875 101.510875 so it's really unless you unless you have some vacation time or some some sick leave or whatever um you kind of have to finagle your way around to get that time so
sw4056A-ms98-a-0024 101.510875 111.581250 that's that's kind of a drawback i think but uh i don't know what do you consider most important you think in terms of of the different benefits
sw4056A-ms98-a-0025 111.581250 119.349250 [silence]
sw4056A-ms98-a-0026 119.349250 120.068500 um-hum
sw4056A-ms98-a-0027 120.068500 125.167000 [silence]
sw4056A-ms98-a-0028 125.167000 126.271875 yeah
sw4056A-ms98-a-0029 126.271875 135.000000 [silence]
sw4056A-ms98-a-0030 135.000000 145.154500 yeah i don't know if you saw on Twenty Twenty the other night they uh they basically reviewed Oregon's plan or The Oregon Plan toward uh nationalizing health care and that kind of thing
sw4056A-ms98-a-0031 145.154500 149.932000 it's kind of an interesting plan it's kind of cold though they've essentially made up a list of uh
sw4056A-ms98-a-0032 149.932000 152.751000 oh all the different uh
sw4056A-ms98-a-0033 152.751000 155.379000 med[ical]- medical maladies that you can have
sw4056A-ms98-a-0034 155.379000 165.380000 and they basically made a cutoff about six hundred and eighty seven and below will not be covered by by uh subsidized health care and and the ones above would
sw4056A-ms98-a-0035 165.380000 170.998875 so it's kind of like drawing this line and and if you have it great if you don't you're kind of out of luck
sw4056A-ms98-a-0036 170.998875 173.568625 but um it [vocalized-noise] was an interesting show 
sw4056A-ms98-a-0037 173.568625 177.157750 i think you're right i think health care is probably the the most pressing
sw4056A-ms98-a-0038 177.157750 184.694125 uh the pressing one but i'll tell you i- i- i don't mind having dental you know uh sometimes dental costs can be 
sw4056A-ms98-a-0039 184.694125 185.769750 um
sw4056A-ms98-a-0040 185.769750 194.158500 just about as expensive if not more and i know historically a lot of companies i think carried dental as a rider along with the medical
sw4056A-ms98-a-0041 194.158500 201.821250 but i'm not sure that's that's widely followed any more i'm not sure how how does uh University of New Hampshire handle it
sw4056A-ms98-a-0042 201.821250 213.305000 [silence]
sw4056A-ms98-a-0043 213.305000 214.383000 um

sw4056A-ms98-a-0047 225.610375 229.993375 is that uh let me interrupt is that the same for both uh
sw4056A-ms98-a-0048 229.993375 236.217750 professors and and also staff and administration is that generally across the board do you think or
sw4056A-ms98-a-0049 236.217750 246.627125 [silence]
sw4056A-ms98-a-0050 246.627125 247.801125 right

sw4056A-ms98-a-0060 271.615375 277.093000 yeah i'm kind of interested because_1 i'm actually that's the route i'd like to take when i finally get my degree
sw4056A-ms98-a-0061 277.093000 279.630375 is to uh is to teach in university
sw4056A-ms98-a-0062 279.630375 282.152750 i'm a doctoral student in Florida right now
sw4056A-ms98-a-0063 282.152750 283.373000 but um
sw4056A-ms98-a-0064 283.373000 290.471625 yeah that's that's interesting that's one of the things i'd like to think about is in what kind of benefits they would uh they would cover and things like that
sw4056A-ms98-a-0065 290.471625 295.645250 [silence]
sw4056A-ms98-a-0066 295.645250 297.260625 oh is that right
