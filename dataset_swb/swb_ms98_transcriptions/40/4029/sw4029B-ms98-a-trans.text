sw4029B-ms98-a-0002 2.401250 7.384875 uh we still have an old uh Texas Instruments
sw4029B-ms98-a-0003 7.384875 9.255500 Professional Computer
sw4029B-ms98-a-0004 9.255500 20.645500 back in the days when TI was making uh computers that were similar to in terms of power to the IBM i don't remember what those were the ATs or something like that or
sw4029B-ms98-a-0005 20.645500 22.121375 [silence]
sw4029B-ms98-a-0006 22.121375 32.412750 [laughter] way back when i don't know where to get any new software for it [laughter-unfortunately] so we just sort of stumble on using
sw4029B-ms98-a-0007 32.412750 35.342875 the same stuff that we always have
sw4029B-ms98-a-0008 35.342875 37.282500 [silence]
sw4029B-ms98-a-0009 37.282500 46.536250 um well i used to i have a Master's degree in computer science but i haven't i i took a time out on careers about 
sw4029B-ms98-a-0010 46.536250 50.757875 six years ago when my first one turned a year old and
sw4029B-ms98-a-0011 50.757875 59.083625 so nowadays i'm teaching him at home and we're using the computer to drill him on math and to let him do some
sw4029B-ms98-a-0012 59.083625 62.412750 creative writing without having to have uh
sw4029B-ms98-a-0013 62.412750 65.945750 uh the mechanics of
sw4029B-ms98-a-0014 65.945750 67.009375 [silence]
sw4029B-ms98-a-0015 67.009375 70.629125 handwriting get in the way of his words this way he can
sw4029B-ms98-a-0016 70.629125 76.369375 he this way he just has to hunt and peck on the [laughter-keyboard] i have to admit i'd like a
sw4029B-ms98-a-0017 76.369375 78.202750 a more logical
sw4029B-ms98-a-0018 78.202750 80.726875 arrangement of the letters and uh
sw4029B-ms98-a-0019 80.726875 83.516125 what do they call it the Cortiope or something
sw4029B-ms98-a-0020 83.516125 85.028125 arrangement
sw4029B-ms98-a-0021 85.028125 91.458125 [silence]
sw4029B-ms98-a-0022 91.458125 92.877500 um
sw4029B-ms98-a-0023 92.877500 94.795625 we haven't for
sw4029B-ms98-a-0024 94.795625 97.721125 we ended up uh
sw4029B-ms98-a-0025 97.721125 105.806750 actually just sort of keeping it in the closet for a number of [laughter-years] [laughter-isn't] that a terrible statement people who are
sw4029B-ms98-a-0026 105.806750 111.804000 we're pretty involved with computers in all sorts of other aspects but um
sw4029B-ms98-a-0027 111.804000 113.138125 [silence]
sw4029B-ms98-a-0028 113.138125 119.416375 i guess i wanted something that was easier to use than this and that was more intuitive and so we just
sw4029B-ms98-a-0029 119.416375 124.339375 it just ended up not not getting used i should use it to balance my checkbook
sw4029B-ms98-a-0030 124.339375 126.925125 but then you have to remember to write it down
sw4029B-ms98-a-0031 126.925125 128.667250 [silence]
sw4029B-ms98-a-0032 128.667250 129.957875 or enter it
sw4029B-ms98-a-0033 129.957875 131.608000 [silence]
sw4029B-ms98-a-0034 131.608000 133.542750 oh my
sw4029B-ms98-a-0035 133.542750 136.476875 where do you find a place to work on a TI
sw4029B-ms98-a-0036 136.476875 139.039750 [silence]
sw4029B-ms98-a-0037 139.039750 140.417000 uh-huh

sw4029B-ms98-a-0041 154.679375 159.903125 yeah well i used to do that i'd used it um until
sw4029B-ms98-a-0042 159.903125 161.444000 [silence]
sw4029B-ms98-a-0043 161.444000 166.674375 as i say until i took a hi[atus]- hiatus from working i used to
sw4029B-ms98-a-0044 166.674375 168.511500 to uh
sw4029B-ms98-a-0045 168.511500 169.758750 [silence]
sw4029B-ms98-a-0046 169.758750 174.071250 trying to think of what you call it i- i used it essentially as a terminal then
sw4029B-ms98-a-0047 174.071250 174.975750 you know
sw4029B-ms98-a-0048 174.975750 177.332125 and
sw4029B-ms98-a-0049 177.332125 178.305375 so
sw4029B-ms98-a-0050 178.305375 186.340375 [silence]
sw4029B-ms98-a-0051 186.340375 187.353625 yeah

sw4029B-ms98-a-0053 188.675750 191.755000 well my kids think i should have games
sw4029B-ms98-a-0054 191.755000 195.139875 on top of games on top of games [laughter]
sw4029B-ms98-a-0055 195.139875 201.080625 and of course we don't have any i keep telling them well you know just learn how to program [laughter]
sw4029B-ms98-a-0056 201.080625 202.554375 [silence]
sw4029B-ms98-a-0057 202.554375 205.609125 write your own games yeah i just
sw4029B-ms98-a-0058 205.609125 210.170500 [silence]
sw4029B-ms98-a-0059 210.170500 211.415125 oh

sw4029B-ms98-a-0067 234.163000 237.441250 no who would do something like that
sw4029B-ms98-a-0068 237.441250 238.980625 but uh
sw4029B-ms98-a-0069 238.980625 240.237125 [silence]
sw4029B-ms98-a-0070 240.237125 244.342000 yeah we have basically we use the WordStar on it
sw4029B-ms98-a-0071 244.342000 246.670375 you know for a bunch of
sw4029B-ms98-a-0072 246.670375 248.184125 [silence]
sw4029B-ms98-a-0073 248.184125 250.875875 i'm taking a class now and
sw4029B-ms98-a-0074 250.875875 255.622875 um i'm actually getting a degree in nursing at this point and i asked the
sw4029B-ms98-a-0075 255.622875 267.148500 and the class i'm taking now all of a sudden they want everything typed till now everything's been handwritten so it was a good thing that the computer was back up and running hooked the printer up to it
sw4029B-ms98-a-0076 267.148500 279.415375 right [laughter] right well i couldn't figure out how to it's been a while since i've gotten it going all right so i tried to hook the printer up and i was sure i put all the
sw4029B-ms98-a-0077 279.415375 292.108875 connectors in right and everything and had checked to make sure the pins were all facing the right way and i couldn't get the computer to recognize that there was a printer there to save my life and so i was like oh this thing doesn't work and we've lost the
sw4029B-ms98-a-0078 292.108875 298.402000 you know we've lost the install software documentation what am i supposed to do so my husband took it in to wo[rk]-
