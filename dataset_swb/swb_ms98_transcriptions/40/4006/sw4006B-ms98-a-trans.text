sw4006B-ms98-a-0014 111.015000 116.528500 well we used to do a lot of camping uh in fact before we had kids Marie and i would go
sw4006B-ms98-a-0015 116.528500 127.211875 we did a lot of canoe camping uh either in upstate New York where there are a lot of lakes up near Lake Placid and in that area and in Northern Ontario which is also full of lakes
sw4006B-ms98-a-0016 127.211875 134.380750 and some of our longest trips went for about six days and covered about seventy miles where you you canoe
sw4006B-ms98-a-0017 134.380750 142.660750 uh from lake to lake sometimes by rivers where they connect or else you have to portage your canoe and all your equipment to the next lake
sw4006B-ms98-a-0018 142.660750 153.129000 and so that that was a i i think it's a lot in a way easier to go canoe camping because you you don't have to watch the weight so much
sw4006B-ms98-a-0019 153.129000 158.556125 and it's also cleaner because you can go swimming every day and it's very easy to keep keep cool and keep clean
