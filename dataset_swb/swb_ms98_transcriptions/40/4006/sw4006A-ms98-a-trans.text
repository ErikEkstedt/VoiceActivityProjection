sw4006A-ms98-a-0029 160.553875 173.816875 we took one canoe trip in California now but the boys were very very small when we were out there and um it was a friend of Webbie's that got this group together
sw4006A-ms98-a-0030 173.816875 184.306375 and uh there had been some rains and therefore the river was a little more swift than what might normally be expected and um
sw4006A-ms98-a-0031 184.306375 196.635875 i- i i found it exciting but i really thought that it was a trifle dangerous maybe because the currents were kind of bad and we just went ahead anyway but it was the Russian River yeah
sw4006A-ms98-a-0032 196.635875 197.851500 [silence]
sw4006A-ms98-a-0033 197.851500 199.732750 yeah yeah
sw4006A-ms98-a-0034 199.732750 212.461750 yeah it can and it did and um it was my first time it was Webbie's first time doing this also and we just t[rusted]- uh trusted in the uh knowledge of
sw4006A-ms98-a-0035 212.461750 217.864625 this friend that got this party together that it would not be over dangerous and we had our
sw4006A-ms98-a-0036 217.864625 229.802875 life belts on and everything else like that but we did dump over once and uh you know with small children like that just made me very nervous we didn't go again the next day we just uh kind of uh 
sw4006A-ms98-a-0037 229.802875 237.082500 stayed by camp site and uh cooked [laughter] but it it was it was very exciting and
sw4006A-ms98-a-0038 237.082500 241.685875 really very nice and um i wouldn't mind doing something like that again
sw4006A-ms98-a-0039 241.685875 252.905000 and i guess the first time you do a major endeavor like that you really are a neophyte you don't know exactly what to expect or even sometimes what to do [noise] but um
sw4006A-ms98-a-0040 252.905000 256.661000 it it was quite an experience uh

sw4006A-ms98-a-0045 285.803250 299.618000 uh absolutely uh i kind of got the information by drips and drabs from last summer as different friends would talk to him and apparently whoever has to carry that water or part
