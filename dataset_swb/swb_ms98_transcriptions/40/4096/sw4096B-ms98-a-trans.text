sw4096B-ms98-a-0018 108.160375 112.988125 which isn't good for business on the other end either i suppose

sw4096B-ms98-a-0026 157.493000 163.035500 right there has to be a a reuse for it i mean that's why they recycle
sw4096B-ms98-a-0027 163.035500 172.338500 the one i think is the most interesting is with the recycled bottles and all that [noise] uh the industry seems to be doing with the recycled polymers
sw4096B-ms98-a-0028 172.338500 185.717750 uh everything from uh waste baskets to carpet to the no stick i mean the sticky slide rugs under the carpet and uh
sw4096B-ms98-a-0029 185.717750 192.930375 i think they're even putting it in the roadways these days and they're making clothes now that are recycled
sw4096B-ms98-a-0030 192.930375 199.565500 [noise] like the recycled plastic Coke bottles and and milk cartons and things like that
