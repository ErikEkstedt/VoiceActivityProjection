sw4096A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.494000 [noise] hello Ann
sw4096A-ms98-a-0002 1.494000 2.851500 [silence]
sw4096A-ms98-a-0003 2.851500 5.393250 um the other day
sw4096A-ms98-a-0004 5.393250 10.244750 i attended a conference here at Utah State University on recycling
sw4096A-ms98-a-0005 10.244750 12.422500 and uh
sw4096A-ms98-a-0006 12.422500 18.967750 i was kind of interested to hear because_1 they had some people from the EPA and lots of different places
sw4096A-ms98-a-0007 18.967750 21.067375 and uh
sw4096A-ms98-a-0008 21.067375 22.886125 they
sw4096A-ms98-a-0009 22.886125 30.076625 had basically decided that there is going to be a real problem here within a few years on solid waste
sw4096A-ms98-a-0010 30.076625 33.992375 [silence]
sw4096A-ms98-a-0011 33.992375 36.789375 [laughter] well it's not too new
sw4096A-ms98-a-0012 36.789375 41.967125 [silence]
sw4096A-ms98-a-0013 41.967125 43.295375 oh
sw4096A-ms98-a-0014 43.295375 44.573500 [silence]
sw4096A-ms98-a-0015 44.573500 49.243750 they really didn't propose any solutions actually they were
sw4096A-ms98-a-0016 49.243750 54.153250 the guy was pretty negative about the things that the government was doing even though he was from the EPA
sw4096A-ms98-a-0017 54.153250 58.467500 but he had a lot of uh facts to to give and
sw4096A-ms98-a-0018 58.467500 63.748375 things like how many solid waste plants were being shut down and
sw4096A-ms98-a-0019 63.748375 65.526875 and uh
sw4096A-ms98-a-0020 65.526875 73.711875 uh one of the most interesting things that he was talking about was recycling of of news print and he was talking about um
sw4096A-ms98-a-0021 73.711875 74.727875 [silence]
sw4096A-ms98-a-0022 74.727875 79.816125 the City of New York and how they went and collected all this news print
sw4096A-ms98-a-0023 79.816125 90.805500 and they could sell it for a while they were able to sell it for some amount per ton and now at this stage of the game where they have gotten into [noise] recycling they've collected so much news print that they have to pay to have it hauled away
sw4096A-ms98-a-0024 90.805500 113.099125 [silence]
sw4096A-ms98-a-0025 113.099125 119.903875 yeah we're doing some here in in Cash Valley the community here there's uh
sw4096A-ms98-a-0026 119.903875 123.500875 we've actually got a kind of a nice set up we've got a
sw4096A-ms98-a-0027 123.500875 127.880625 couple of plants here that actually take uh recycled paper
sw4096A-ms98-a-0028 127.880625 132.826625 and shred it and spray it with chemical treatment so that it's not
sw4096A-ms98-a-0029 132.826625 136.829250 a fire hazard and make it into insulation
sw4096A-ms98-a-0030 136.829250 145.413000 and they can actually use as much recycled paper as the community can get to them_1 because they're actually buying it and shipping it in from outside
sw4096A-ms98-a-0031 145.413000 146.487625 [silence]
sw4096A-ms98-a-0032 146.487625 152.681625 so one of the real keys it sounds like to getting recycling for uh paper or something like that to go is to
sw4096A-ms98-a-0033 152.681625 153.684375 [silence]
sw4096A-ms98-a-0034 153.684375 158.307125 get some sort of business to actually want it once you've collected it
sw4096A-ms98-a-0035 158.307125 183.093000 [silence]
sw4096A-ms98-a-0036 183.093000 184.426500 um-hum
sw4096A-ms98-a-0037 184.426500 199.340500 [silence]
sw4096A-ms98-a-0038 199.340500 204.692750 and there's a paper presented at this conference from a guy from Alabama
sw4096A-ms98-a-0039 204.692750 212.665750 and he was kind of hired to do a study by two departments for the government one was like environmental protection and the other one was
sw4096A-ms98-a-0040 212.665750 217.981875 oh i can't remember what but the basic idea it was presented to him was
sw4096A-ms98-a-0041 217.981875 225.906750 how can we maximize the amount of energy that we can get back from recycling and minimize the volume of stuff we are putting into our landfill 
sw4096A-ms98-a-0042 225.906750 230.237875 and uh the solution that he came up with for plastics
sw4096A-ms98-a-0043 230.237875 235.217875 and it was really quite amazing because_1 he says well the best thing to do with plastics is to burn them_1
sw4096A-ms98-a-0044 235.217875 240.832875 he came to the conclusion plastics is actually one of the biggest problems in landfills cause it's
sw4096A-ms98-a-0045 240.832875 245.098750 it's low weight but it's high volume so it takes up a lot of space
sw4096A-ms98-a-0046 245.098750 255.585750 and there's almost no energy there's very little energy value in actually doing a lot of the recycling but there's a lot of energy in it if you can burn it and use it to produce electricity
sw4096A-ms98-a-0047 255.585750 259.495125 so his solution was to burn plastic collect it and burn it
sw4096A-ms98-a-0048 259.495125 263.455875 [silence]
sw4096A-ms98-a-0049 263.455875 270.660750 yeah and it's more than even paper or something like that there's more energy in it per pound or whatever
sw4096A-ms98-a-0050 270.660750 281.442750 well that was [laughter] he didn't deal with that he just said burn it he didn't talk about cleaning it up or anything like that so it's not very practical is it
sw4096A-ms98-a-0051 281.442750 286.282000 [silence]
sw4096A-ms98-a-0052 286.282000 288.318375 yeah well real interest[ing]-
sw4096A-ms98-a-0053 288.318375 289.430500 [silence]
sw4096A-ms98-a-0054 289.430500 290.807375 [noise] um
sw4096A-ms98-a-0055 290.807375 291.892750 [silence]
sw4096A-ms98-a-0056 291.892750 294.068000 not too much i'm
sw4096A-ms98-a-0057 294.068000 296.537250 [silence]
sw4096A-ms98-a-0058 296.537250 298.306000 uh i got a bit actuall[y]-
