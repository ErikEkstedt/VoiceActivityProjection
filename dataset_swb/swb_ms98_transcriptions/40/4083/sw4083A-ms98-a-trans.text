sw4083A-ms98-a-0002 0.105625 3.449250 so what do you think about uh employers screening
sw4083A-ms98-a-0003 3.449250 7.016875 you know job candidates for drug drug usage
sw4083A-ms98-a-0004 7.016875 20.029125 [silence]
sw4083A-ms98-a-0005 20.029125 21.497000 right

sw4083A-ms98-a-0007 28.911125 33.251750 right you think it infringes on personal rights to have that type of screening
sw4083A-ms98-a-0008 33.251750 49.978625 [silence]
sw4083A-ms98-a-0009 49.978625 53.467250 but a lot of times people who are on drugs don't admit it
sw4083A-ms98-a-0010 53.467250 64.109750 [silence]
sw4083A-ms98-a-0011 64.109750 69.163250 right yeah i don't really have that much a problem with drug screening i think um
sw4083A-ms98-a-0012 69.163250 78.350125 if it's gonna effect their job performance uh i think it's reasonable for an employer to request a drug test but uh
sw4083A-ms98-a-0013 78.350125 98.106125 [silence]
sw4083A-ms98-a-0014 98.106125 100.260125 right
sw4083A-ms98-a-0015 100.260125 107.472375 yeah it always should be mandatory for some uh positions such as those but um
sw4083A-ms98-a-0016 107.472375 129.873375 [silence]
sw4083A-ms98-a-0017 129.873375 142.441625 that's true that's true you there has to be that's the that's the key i think is is what happens when you find a person who is on drugs you got to just that's when you have to be careful you know you just can't
sw4083A-ms98-a-0018 142.441625 146.566625 fire every person something needs to be done to help these kind of these people
sw4083A-ms98-a-0019 146.566625 153.257125 [silence]
sw4083A-ms98-a-0020 153.257125 155.487125 right they can go and
sw4083A-ms98-a-0021 155.487125 159.830500 [silence]
sw4083A-ms98-a-0022 159.830500 167.268500 right there should be some sort of program they can go into to try to clean themselves up and be given a second chance

sw4083A-ms98-a-0034 216.678625 226.779375 i don't know i'm thinking if from my perspective let's say you owned a business um you would want to have the opportunity to screen any uh candidate for a job within your own company
sw4083A-ms98-a-0035 226.779375 233.232875 and if you put yourself in that situation you don't want to hire someone who's on cocaine
sw4083A-ms98-a-0036 233.232875 243.511625 no but i i could it's something i may do eventually so um from that perspective i can i'd see the need for drug testing
sw4083A-ms98-a-0037 243.511625 254.749250 [silence]

sw4083A-ms98-a-0044 280.435875 290.110625 right yeah you can't really do that you could be hiring someone for uh uh a managerial white collar position in your company and uh the person can appear very
sw4083A-ms98-a-0045 290.110625 296.389000 well qualified and and perfectly normal but uh they may be having a lot more problems
