sw4083B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.491375 [noise]
sw4083B-ms98-a-0002 0.491375 7.280500 [silence]
sw4083B-ms98-a-0003 7.280500 10.490000 well i can kind of see it both ways because um
sw4083B-ms98-a-0004 10.490000 11.608000 [silence]
sw4083B-ms98-a-0005 11.608000 20.796500 you don't want to get i guess i generally feel against it but i can see why an employer wouldn't want to have employees that are on drugs
sw4083B-ms98-a-0006 20.796500 29.476875 that could cause all kind of problems i'd would like to see it see them be able to not need to screen more than i would like to see them screening
sw4083B-ms98-a-0007 29.476875 33.657250 [silence]
sw4083B-ms98-a-0008 33.657250 43.566250 right i think that we ought to be [vocalized-noise] employer certainly has the right to say on the application are you on drugs or something like that
sw4083B-ms98-a-0009 43.566250 50.016375 and then if they say well i'm on drugs then they say well we would li[ke]- rather have somebody that isn't on drugs
sw4083B-ms98-a-0010 50.016375 52.947125 [silence]
sw4083B-ms98-a-0011 52.947125 59.039375 that's right especially when they're trying to get a job and i guess everybody knows that if they're trying to get a job
sw4083B-ms98-a-0012 59.039375 60.062875 [silence]
sw4083B-ms98-a-0013 60.062875 61.591125 that
sw4083B-ms98-a-0014 61.591125 65.463125 if they put down that they're on drugs they're not gonna get [laughter-it]
sw4083B-ms98-a-0015 65.463125 76.282250 [silence]
sw4083B-ms98-a-0016 76.282250 88.446875 right i guess depends on the job some jobs that de[pend]- on which public safety depends like um pilots and air traffic controllers people who drive the trains
sw4083B-ms98-a-0017 88.446875 91.629750 um things like that but i don't think SEPTA
sw4083B-ms98-a-0018 91.629750 101.373750 actually [laughter] does um routine screening for their workers and that might not be a bad idea i've see a couple that look like they might be on drugs
sw4083B-ms98-a-0019 101.373750 105.408125 [silence]
sw4083B-ms98-a-0020 105.408125 106.627750 right
sw4083B-ms98-a-0021 106.627750 108.241125 [silence]
sw4083B-ms98-a-0022 108.241125 109.785375 but other well i don't know
sw4083B-ms98-a-0023 109.785375 110.852250 [silence]
sw4083B-ms98-a-0024 110.852250 112.872250 every job
sw4083B-ms98-a-0025 112.872250 114.682250 right i guess
sw4083B-ms98-a-0026 114.682250 115.712000 [silence]
sw4083B-ms98-a-0027 115.712000 117.849000 i don't know i'd would
sw4083B-ms98-a-0028 117.849000 130.401000 obviously an employer doesn't wanna have a person on drugs but if somebody's on drugs and they get into the work place it might be uh a better thing for them than to have them_1 out there on the street mugging people
sw4083B-ms98-a-0029 130.401000 142.015250 [silence]
sw4083B-ms98-a-0030 142.015250 143.788750 that's right
sw4083B-ms98-a-0031 143.788750 146.036250 [silence]
sw4083B-ms98-a-0032 146.036250 154.161125 that's right if they now behind the drug testing was something like that so that it wasn't that a person just didn't get a job that
sw4083B-ms98-a-0033 154.161125 160.491000 if they ever tested uh positive on drugs then they'd if that were the case then they'd be always unemployed
sw4083B-ms98-a-0034 160.491000 162.397875 so
sw4083B-ms98-a-0035 162.397875 166.560875 [silence]
sw4083B-ms98-a-0036 166.560875 169.839750 well some perhaps a program but
sw4083B-ms98-a-0037 169.839750 171.790375 [silence]
sw4083B-ms98-a-0038 171.790375 180.436500 i know people go into programs there with other people that have a lot of the same problems and that's in some ways good it lets them feel like they have support
sw4083B-ms98-a-0039 180.436500 191.681250 but on the other si[de]- hand it's they need to be around people that have their lives together and aren't on drugs they need to be you know people wouldn't be getting into trouble as much if they
sw4083B-ms98-a-0040 191.681250 195.167250 especially young people here in Philadelphia
sw4083B-ms98-a-0041 195.167250 201.888500 if they had [vocalized-noise] if they were so busy during the day that when they went
sw4083B-ms98-a-0042 201.888500 205.953625 um when they went home at night they were tired and they had to go to sleep
sw4083B-ms98-a-0043 205.953625 208.039125 so
sw4083B-ms98-a-0044 208.039125 214.883500 but if people are not working and they're just running around loose with nothing to do they got a lot of energy and it gets them_1 into trouble
sw4083B-ms98-a-0045 214.883500 220.470000 [silence]
sw4083B-ms98-a-0046 220.470000 221.679625 [noise]
sw4083B-ms98-a-0047 221.679625 226.229000 [silence]
sw4083B-ms98-a-0048 226.229000 227.569375 um-hum
sw4083B-ms98-a-0049 227.569375 232.175000 [silence]
sw4083B-ms98-a-0050 232.175000 234.508625 right are you in business
sw4083B-ms98-a-0051 234.508625 237.359000 [silence]
sw4083B-ms98-a-0052 237.359000 238.491000 uh-huh
sw4083B-ms98-a-0053 238.491000 242.785500 [silence]
sw4083B-ms98-a-0054 242.785500 255.376500 right more more or less for large businesses than small businesses i think mostly go on personal contacts and who knows who and what people they know would say about them
sw4083B-ms98-a-0055 255.376500 263.630125 so with thinking about my daddy and working down on the farm in South Carolina and hiring people and
sw4083B-ms98-a-0056 263.630125 267.847750 you know even at fast food restaurants and um
sw4083B-ms98-a-0057 267.847750 269.723500 field work it's
sw4083B-ms98-a-0058 269.723500 275.718250 the person doing the hiring and the supervisor going and talking to people and finding out who know what about who
sw4083B-ms98-a-0059 275.718250 282.098125 i guess it's kind of the old boy network maybe that isn't as much so in the larger cities like Philadelphia [vocalized-noise] 
sw4083B-ms98-a-0060 282.098125 287.426750 [silence]
sw4083B-ms98-a-0061 287.426750 288.695375 right
sw4083B-ms98-a-0062 288.695375 295.468125 [silence]
sw4083B-ms98-a-0063 295.468125 299.042000 um-hum yeah they can [vocalized-noise]
