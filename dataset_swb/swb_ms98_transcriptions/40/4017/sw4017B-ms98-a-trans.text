sw4017B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.527500 [noise]
sw4017B-ms98-a-0002 0.527500 20.468625 [silence]
sw4017B-ms98-a-0003 20.468625 22.430250 i agree with that [laughter]
sw4017B-ms98-a-0004 22.430250 54.380500 [silence]
sw4017B-ms98-a-0005 54.380500 56.993750 local politics yeah
sw4017B-ms98-a-0006 56.993750 67.326500 well also too often too the uh individual congressman has the uh especially if they are on on uh some of the committees that put these budgets together
sw4017B-ms98-a-0007 67.326500 77.918125 uh have the opportunity to slide things in that normally should not have gone in at all and the l[ine]- yeah and the line item uh veto would be ideal for that i mean to
sw4017B-ms98-a-0008 77.918125 85.606250 [silence]
sw4017B-ms98-a-0009 85.606250 86.230000 [laughter]
sw4017B-ms98-a-0010 86.230000 105.014875 [silence]
sw4017B-ms98-a-0011 105.014875 106.346250 yeah
sw4017B-ms98-a-0012 106.346250 117.934625 [silence]
sw4017B-ms98-a-0013 117.934625 118.994000 yeah
sw4017B-ms98-a-0014 118.994000 120.987500 [silence]
sw4017B-ms98-a-0015 120.987500 121.929875 yeah
sw4017B-ms98-a-0016 121.929875 126.359375 [silence]
sw4017B-ms98-a-0017 126.359375 137.489250 there's another i[dea]- uh uh another uh way where the budget could uh probably benefit and this has to do of course uh it has to do with federal projects
sw4017B-ms98-a-0018 137.489250 150.391125 too often uh those are uh not there's no uh accountability once the uh projects are awarded to make sure that the quality is done and they end up getting stuck with
sw4017B-ms98-a-0019 150.391125 152.635250 billions of dollars of overlay
sw4017B-ms98-a-0020 152.635250 161.295375 or if contracts are put out uh no one uh is responsible or it does does not seem to be
sw4017B-ms98-a-0021 161.295375 171.798625 for following up that if it goes over budget it it well you know it's set up laissez faire attitude well that's to be expected we just sort of built it in well that shouldn't happen that way
sw4017B-ms98-a-0022 171.798625 182.721625 and i think i think if there was more attention paid to uh what's being uh spent and more accountability that would help enor[mous]- enormously too are
sw4017B-ms98-a-0023 182.721625 191.354125 how who or how that would come about i'm not uh sure but that's an an an area that i think needs to be uh looked at
sw4017B-ms98-a-0024 191.354125 220.186000 [silence]
sw4017B-ms98-a-0025 220.186000 224.995500 well i think uh there could be a lot of consolidation of programs
sw4017B-ms98-a-0026 224.995500 232.027375 uh looking at of course there they have been a lot of talk to begin with but looking at and the [noise] the military's a big uh 
sw4017B-ms98-a-0027 232.027375 240.180125 area that uh has taken a lot of shots recently but i- i do not see the point of having four different services
sw4017B-ms98-a-0028 240.180125 244.732125 uh i do not see why they could not have one military service
sw4017B-ms98-a-0029 244.732125 246.448375 [silence]
sw4017B-ms98-a-0030 246.448375 251.960750 that's right because a lot of the monies are spent uh with insiding within those departments
sw4017B-ms98-a-0031 251.960750 259.978375 [silence]
sw4017B-ms98-a-0032 259.978375 261.726500 uh
sw4017B-ms98-a-0033 261.726500 262.734250 [silence]
sw4017B-ms98-a-0034 262.734250 265.459250 basically i'm in i'm in agreement with that
sw4017B-ms98-a-0035 265.459250 273.084500 uh i would think that there probably needs to be a uh monitor or not a monitor uh
sw4017B-ms98-a-0036 273.084500 276.964500 or courtesy you know yeah a presence but not a
sw4017B-ms98-a-0037 276.964500 278.023125 [silence]
sw4017B-ms98-a-0038 278.023125 287.956125 no well wit[ness]- witness the the recent Gulf War too even with uh troops all over Europe uh it took several months to gear up
sw4017B-ms98-a-0039 287.956125 291.037625 and so what was the point of having them to begin with
sw4017B-ms98-a-0040 291.037625 298.306000 [silence]
