sw4017A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 4.489625 [noise] uh well it's nice to talk with you um
sw4017A-ms98-a-0002 4.489625 14.329000 oh i guess i'll go ahead and start off with uh i think that there's two things that could be done that are procedural to [noise] uh
sw4017A-ms98-a-0003 14.329000 21.685875 to help the budget the first i believe in would be to give the president a line item veto um
sw4017A-ms98-a-0004 21.685875 26.914000 uh i think that a lot of times the the members of congress
sw4017A-ms98-a-0005 26.914000 37.296125 uh when they're faced with uh the possibility of having to to cut jobs in their district by because of shutting down a federal project or something just don't have the
sw4017A-ms98-a-0006 37.296125 40.459000 the willpower on their own to uh
sw4017A-ms98-a-0007 40.459000 50.341750 to make the tough decisions and sometimes it would be best to give that over to the president who who has overall responsibility for the whole country and can uh
sw4017A-ms98-a-0008 50.341750 57.507625 i guess be a little bit more insulated from from uh the concerns of one of one district
sw4017A-ms98-a-0009 57.507625 72.019375 [silence]
sw4017A-ms98-a-0010 72.019375 74.111125 yeah that's exactly right
sw4017A-ms98-a-0011 74.111125 75.611375 [noise]
sw4017A-ms98-a-0012 75.611375 77.633875 [silence]
sw4017A-ms98-a-0013 77.633875 90.188875 yeah one of the the uh there's a bill pending before congress which i'm trying to remember what it's called it's something like the pork buster bill that um if approved would make it uh
sw4017A-ms98-a-0014 90.188875 94.194250 uh uh you wouldn't be able to um
sw4017A-ms98-a-0015 94.194250 104.015875 put in uh new projects and things in a conference committee or at anytime where they weren't reviewed by the regular committee that has responsibility for that
sw4017A-ms98-a-0016 104.015875 107.825000 and that's like what you were talking about where they slip things in at the last minute
sw4017A-ms98-a-0017 107.825000 112.254875 and the conference committee is really the worst place for that to happen
sw4017A-ms98-a-0018 112.254875 114.659875 uh because no one
sw4017A-ms98-a-0019 114.659875 116.525000 uh
sw4017A-ms98-a-0020 116.525000 127.027125 uh has uh it doesn't go back into the regular committee for review after the conference committee it just goes back to the house and the senate for a final up or down vote on the whole thing
sw4017A-ms98-a-0021 127.027125 171.744500 [silence]
sw4017A-ms98-a-0022 171.744500 173.431625 i agree
sw4017A-ms98-a-0023 173.431625 182.123750 [silence]
sw4017A-ms98-a-0024 182.123750 183.425625 um-hum
sw4017A-ms98-a-0025 183.425625 190.903250 [silence]
sw4017A-ms98-a-0026 190.903250 202.643250 yeah it it really sometimes seems that there is there's nobody out there uh watching out for uh for we the people and making sure that the money is spent wisely uh [laughter]
sw4017A-ms98-a-0027 202.643250 211.940750 and i don't know that just sort of seems to be unfortunately part of the just how the system uh operates now uh w[e]-
sw4017A-ms98-a-0028 211.940750 220.866875 gee is there anything specific that you think uh uh in the way of federal programs or whatever that would be eliminated to try to cut federal spending
sw4017A-ms98-a-0029 220.866875 244.047500 [silence]
sw4017A-ms98-a-0030 244.047500 247.404125 and just eliminate all that high level bureaucracy
sw4017A-ms98-a-0031 247.404125 251.179375 [silence]
sw4017A-ms98-a-0032 251.179375 260.084000 how do you feel about bringing home all of our troops from Europe and the Far East and letting Germany and Japan defend themselves
sw4017A-ms98-a-0033 260.084000 264.901500 [silence]
sw4017A-ms98-a-0034 264.901500 265.879500 yeah
sw4017A-ms98-a-0035 265.879500 273.301750 [silence]
sw4017A-ms98-a-0036 273.301750 279.564625 well we'll always have a presence there but we don't we don't need to have half a million troops overseas
sw4017A-ms98-a-0037 279.564625 287.307000 [silence]
sw4017A-ms98-a-0038 287.307000 288.683875 that's right
sw4017A-ms98-a-0039 288.683875 290.333625 [silence]
sw4017A-ms98-a-0040 290.333625 291.581000 um-hum
sw4017A-ms98-a-0041 291.581000 298.306000 yeah another area that's that i really think ought to be cut is is direct uh foreign aid
