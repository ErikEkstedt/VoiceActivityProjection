sw4094B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.529500 [noise] yeah
sw4094B-ms98-a-0002 0.529500 6.139750 [silence]
sw4094B-ms98-a-0003 6.139750 7.888375 that's correct
sw4094B-ms98-a-0004 7.888375 9.712250 right uh-huh
sw4094B-ms98-a-0005 9.712250 17.203750 [silence]
sw4094B-ms98-a-0006 17.203750 18.501375 [laughter-right]
sw4094B-ms98-a-0007 18.501375 21.545750 [silence]
sw4094B-ms98-a-0008 21.545750 24.945250 yes i i really think that um
sw4094B-ms98-a-0009 24.945250 27.066375 there is room for that
sw4094B-ms98-a-0010 27.066375 40.035125 i feel like if anybody has committed murder and they and they convict them that they definitely and they're sentenced to life in prison then it's not fair to have us to pay for them to stay there for life and then get paroled and go back out
sw4094B-ms98-a-0011 40.035125 43.639500 i believe that if they're convicted and it's um
sw4094B-ms98-a-0012 43.639500 44.669500 [silence]
sw4094B-ms98-a-0013 44.669500 51.669875 you know the only scary part i see in that is a crooked law system that would put people to death without enough evidence
sw4094B-ms98-a-0014 51.669875 54.114875 to close the case do you know what i mean
sw4094B-ms98-a-0015 54.114875 56.609750 [silence]
sw4094B-ms98-a-0016 56.609750 57.850875 right
sw4094B-ms98-a-0017 57.850875 67.500750 [silence]
sw4094B-ms98-a-0018 67.500750 76.173500 well i don't think it's too uh productive to put someone in prison for a life time or like they say sometimes people get eight life sentences on top of each other
sw4094B-ms98-a-0019 76.173500 77.190000 [silence]
sw4094B-ms98-a-0020 77.190000 84.236375 right and um then they're repeat offenders um i went to school with one of Ted Bundy's attacked girls
sw4094B-ms98-a-0021 84.236375 96.687000 she was um older than me she was three years older but she went to the same high school as i did and we all knew when she was taken and he had been under suspicion and everything at that point
sw4094B-ms98-a-0022 96.687000 100.800000 and i think he killed her definitely uh-hum
sw4094B-ms98-a-0023 100.800000 113.674500 [silence]
sw4094B-ms98-a-0024 113.674500 120.570375 right um i think that in my belief i bel[ieve]- we uh i believe that if a person has killed
sw4094B-ms98-a-0025 120.570375 131.997625 then there really isn't much point to them going on anyway because they pretty much ruined what they came to earth to do you know what they're here to do to try to make life um the best that they can
sw4094B-ms98-a-0026 131.997625 134.316750 [silence]
sw4094B-ms98-a-0027 134.316750 146.375875 i definitely no i don't think so i don't think that that's something that we should try to get excited about watching like boxing or some sport i don't agree with that and i don't even think that they need to
sw4094B-ms98-a-0028 146.375875 155.001250 have more than just a couple people in there to make sure that it's done and it should be i think it should be done as painlessly and just done as nicely as it can be
sw4094B-ms98-a-0029 155.001250 158.704875 but i don't believe in keeping all these prisoners what do you think
sw4094B-ms98-a-0030 158.704875 171.840625 [silence]
sw4094B-ms98-a-0031 171.840625 173.086000 right
sw4094B-ms98-a-0032 173.086000 188.849625 [silence]
sw4094B-ms98-a-0033 188.849625 194.921375 oh i think that there should be capital punishment even for other things i think somebody that's caught selling drugs
sw4094B-ms98-a-0034 194.921375 204.582750 if that shouldn't be capital punishment but if they're the high ones that are making these drugs and importing them i think that you could consider that because in essence they're taking lives
sw4094B-ms98-a-0035 204.582750 206.125875 [silence]
sw4094B-ms98-a-0036 206.125875 211.650500 because people are thinking you know what am i going to get five years if i'm caught so what's the big deal
sw4094B-ms98-a-0037 211.650500 214.984125 [silence]
sw4094B-ms98-a-0038 214.984125 216.000500 yep
sw4094B-ms98-a-0039 216.000500 217.500875 [silence]
sw4094B-ms98-a-0040 217.500875 218.514000 no
sw4094B-ms98-a-0041 218.514000 219.893625 and um
sw4094B-ms98-a-0042 219.893625 224.161500 so i- i- i think that it could go even farther than 
sw4094B-ms98-a-0043 224.161500 225.514250 [silence]
sw4094B-ms98-a-0044 225.514250 233.708500 i think that i don't know it's hard you don't want to be so mean that you're you're doing away with people that have a chance to change
sw4094B-ms98-a-0045 233.708500 242.132875 but then i you look at the reports of people that are in prison and they act like they're reformed and then they get out and they re[peat]- repeat these offenses
sw4094B-ms98-a-0046 242.132875 243.500000 so
sw4094B-ms98-a-0047 243.500000 247.492625 [silence]
sw4094B-ms98-a-0048 247.492625 249.856250 [laughter]
sw4094B-ms98-a-0049 249.856250 251.007000 yeah
sw4094B-ms98-a-0050 251.007000 254.067250 [silence]
sw4094B-ms98-a-0051 254.067250 255.405500 that's
sw4094B-ms98-a-0052 255.405500 256.410625 [silence]
sw4094B-ms98-a-0053 256.410625 266.251125 yeah i'm i'm a Christian also and that's why you get in the situation where um it says how i believe but if a person's committed murder that's an unpardonable sin
sw4094B-ms98-a-0054 266.251125 274.376375 and so why should we pardon something that we don't believe our our Lo[rd]- uh God is pardoning do you know what i mean
sw4094B-ms98-a-0055 274.376375 277.980750 [silence]
sw4094B-ms98-a-0056 277.980750 281.998875 [laughter]
