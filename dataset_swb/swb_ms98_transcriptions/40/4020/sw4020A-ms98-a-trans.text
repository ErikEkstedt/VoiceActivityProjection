sw4020A-ms98-a-0022 83.034625 92.266250 because_1 um you have more backup and more people to call on with problems that may arise and uh
sw4020A-ms98-a-0023 92.266250 97.837250 of course uh you know it uh it varies with the situations

sw4020A-ms98-a-0046 173.381000 181.592875 i know uh ours has improved over what it was because_1 we just went to a larger corporation and that's what helped it improve but
sw4020A-ms98-a-0047 181.592875 188.370625 the one thing i'd like to see in our profession is our retirement benefits are almost [laughter-pathetic]
sw4020A-ms98-a-0048 188.370625 191.269250 so that's how i'd like to improve ours

sw4020A-ms98-a-0057 220.745500 229.508125 well in the large corporations the one the thing you have to be so careful of now is being cut when you are almost at retirement age and 
sw4020A-ms98-a-0058 229.508125 232.526875 yeah and that's that's kind of rough

sw4020A-ms98-a-0070 258.149125 264.390125 yeah but uh course i think they're losing an awful lot of valuable expertise

sw4020A-ms98-a-0074 272.505375 282.416500 i used to to be in actual management and hiring and we figured it cost us probably at least a thousand dollars on each turn off and rehire
sw4020A-ms98-a-0075 282.416500 287.378000 because of all the paperwork and different departments that had to work on it
sw4020A-ms98-a-0076 287.378000 289.738250 yeah it was uh
sw4020A-ms98-a-0077 289.738250 294.501875 it's expensive and i don't know why they don't build that into it but i guess
sw4020A-ms98-a-0078 294.501875 296.352625 [vocalized-noise]
