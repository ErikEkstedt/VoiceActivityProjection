sw4079B-ms98-a-0021 75.136500 76.489250 [silence]
sw4079B-ms98-a-0022 76.489250 86.936500 well i found that uh you know thing[s]- as as i've gotten older i'm in my fifties now but before we use to have to have to v[ery]- have a very strict budget i had four kids and uh
sw4079B-ms98-a-0023 86.936500 95.268250 you know we we planned out how much we're going to spend for food and how much for for this and for that and kind of anticipate how much things were going to be and
sw4079B-ms98-a-0024 95.268250 109.240750 uh i guess one interesting aspect of the budgeting i do now is that i set aside uh like i kind of fence off areas of my check book for instance there are certain things that i know -[w]ill come up uh every so often every six months i have to pay car insurance
sw4079B-ms98-a-0025 109.240750 121.594500 uh every six months i have to pay my taxes so i take a set amount i've got a money market account that i do a lot of uh saving in and i also have got a checking account besides that but
sw4079B-ms98-a-0026 121.594500 132.006375 what i do on my money market account for my taxes for instance which amount to uh an average of two hundred and twenty dollars a month i'll just take two hundred and twenty out and i put it in parenthesis i take it out of the right line total
sw4079B-ms98-a-0027 132.006375 140.172875 and put it in parenthesis in there and let it build up every month i add two hundred and twenty dollars to it and then when the tax bill comes in i've got that much set aside
sw4079B-ms98-a-0028 140.172875 142.497875 and i guess that's a way of budgeting
sw4079B-ms98-a-0029 142.497875 153.824625 [silence]
sw4079B-ms98-a-0030 153.824625 155.021125 um-hum

sw4079B-ms98-a-0038 195.708875 202.133125 so uh you know i get one paid for and uh actually i'm saving up for another one besides so
