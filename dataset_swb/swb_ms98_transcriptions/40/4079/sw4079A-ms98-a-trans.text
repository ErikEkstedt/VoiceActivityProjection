sw4079A-ms98-a-0004 5.986125 35.030750 [silence]
sw4079A-ms98-a-0005 35.030750 36.809375 right that's
sw4079A-ms98-a-0006 36.809375 44.281750 that's sounds like uh probably a tighter controlled budget than what i have [laughter] i'm single so i guess
sw4079A-ms98-a-0007 44.281750 48.969000 uh i don't know if that's an excuse for not having a tight budget but i basically
sw4079A-ms98-a-0008 48.969000 50.476375 right i don't need to [laughter]
sw4079A-ms98-a-0009 50.476375 54.287000 i'm the only that i have to keep track of so it makes it a little bit easier
sw4079A-ms98-a-0010 54.287000 60.926250 um and also i you know i try to save a certain amount each month as well and uh
sw4079A-ms98-a-0011 60.926250 62.221000 i kind of
sw4079A-ms98-a-0012 62.221000 67.502125 i kind of have an idea of what my expenses are and i i'm pretty consistent from month to month
sw4079A-ms98-a-0013 67.502125 74.555250 and uh whenever i need to uh you know whenever that changes i'm pretty well aware of it without actually having to maintain a budget for it
sw4079A-ms98-a-0014 74.555250 112.339000 [silence]
sw4079A-ms98-a-0015 112.339000 113.629375 um-hum

sw4079A-ms98-a-0021 141.928500 143.472750 yeah that's
sw4079A-ms98-a-0022 143.472750 148.393000 i guess i kind of do a similar thing more m[edium]- uh medium or longer range i just have a
sw4079A-ms98-a-0023 148.393000 154.499625 maybe a target amount that i'll save for like i'm probably within a year i'd like to buy a new car
sw4079A-ms98-a-0024 154.499625 160.452000 so i kind of have uh an amount in my mind and i'm making every effort to
sw4079A-ms98-a-0025 160.452000 163.009125 to [vocalized-noise] put a little bit away and
sw4079A-ms98-a-0026 163.009125 166.099500 you know increase the amount i need for a down payment or whatever
sw4079A-ms98-a-0027 166.099500 176.534625 [silence]
sw4079A-ms98-a-0028 176.534625 178.010875 right

sw4079A-ms98-a-0032 201.497375 202.555375 hm
sw4079A-ms98-a-0033 202.555375 206.509750 [silence]
sw4079A-ms98-a-0034 206.509750 207.826625 right
sw4079A-ms98-a-0035 207.826625 212.783375 [silence]
sw4079A-ms98-a-0036 212.783375 213.850750 right
sw4079A-ms98-a-0037 213.850750 216.014125 have you thought about uh leasing
sw4079A-ms98-a-0038 216.014125 220.540000 [silence]
sw4079A-ms98-a-0039 220.540000 221.749125 i see
sw4079A-ms98-a-0040 221.749125 224.653375 [silence]
sw4079A-ms98-a-0041 224.653375 226.091125 right
sw4079A-ms98-a-0042 226.091125 230.996125 but if you're rolling it over every three years it might be advantageous to do that
sw4079A-ms98-a-0043 230.996125 232.780000 [silence]
sw4079A-ms98-a-0044 232.780000 245.631500 you know typically you [vocalized-noise] if you purchase your own car you tend to make uh the best returns after you pay it off of course you know the longer you keep it beyond that point the more profitable it is to own it yourself
sw4079A-ms98-a-0045 245.631500 259.211000 [silence]
sw4079A-ms98-a-0046 259.211000 270.597250 that's right [laughter] yeah mine's uh seven years old and i think last year was that was a rough year for it i had ex[penses]- a number of expenses
sw4079A-ms98-a-0047 270.597250 272.341125 but uh i'm hoping that
sw4079A-ms98-a-0048 272.341125 275.277875 m[ost]- most of them_1 were just kind of uh you know the
sw4079A-ms98-a-0049 275.277875 282.374000 as you get to a certain number of miles you have to get everything replaced brake shocks and all that so i just went through that whole set last year
sw4079A-ms98-a-0050 282.374000 286.106250 and i'm hoping i'll be have a slow period before i need that again [laughter]
sw4079A-ms98-a-0051 286.106250 293.732625 [silence]
sw4079A-ms98-a-0052 293.732625 295.084375 right
