sw4078B-ms98-a-0002 0.489375 2.723000 [silence]
sw4078B-ms98-a-0003 2.723000 11.750750 well you know they actually started and i assumed it was TI wide um uh they they've started putting out at least recycling bins for the paper
sw4078B-ms98-a-0004 11.750750 19.992750 uh i've you know either computer paper or different types of paper i've had some ideas on how i think they could probably do it a little um
sw4078B-ms98-a-0005 19.992750 26.229500 less expensively and accomplish the same purpose but i- i guess i need to put it on paper and turn it in [laughter]
sw4078B-ms98-a-0006 26.229500 27.433000 um
sw4078B-ms98-a-0007 27.433000 28.912750 [silence]
sw4078B-ms98-a-0008 28.912750 40.829125 [noise] well the way they have you know they have boxes located at certain areas throughout a module or down the hall or [vocalized-noise] a lot of people aren't going to get up walk out of their offices and go there
sw4078B-ms98-a-0009 40.829125 45.918875 you know where i used to work we had what we called tree boxes that's just what we called them_1
sw4078B-ms98-a-0010 45.918875 53.537000 and they were recycled cardboard they were eight and a half by eleven and you set it by your desk and you know as you got rid of a piece of paper you stuck it in there
sw4078B-ms98-a-0011 53.537000 63.072500 and when it filled up you called you know facilities whoever to come pick it up and they brought you another box so not only is it you know i think more people would take advantage of it and use it
sw4078B-ms98-a-0012 63.072500 73.434250 uh i think you save a lot of the cleaning service's time and effort and money that we're paying for them to to empty the trash cans and combine it and bundle it and things like that now when it could all be done in one step
sw4078B-ms98-a-0013 73.434250 76.352875 kind of type thing so
sw4078B-ms98-a-0014 76.352875 81.862875 [silence]
sw4078B-ms98-a-0015 81.862875 83.526125 right
sw4078B-ms98-a-0016 83.526125 85.631875 but [noise]
sw4078B-ms98-a-0017 85.631875 88.866500 [silence]
sw4078B-ms98-a-0018 88.866500 99.339625 right but somebody still has to collect all that and bundle it together and whereas if you had a box that was preset and it got full you closed the box it's already bundled it's already done for you
sw4078B-ms98-a-0019 99.339625 103.686375 so you're saving a lot of time and effort i just need to put it on paper and
sw4078B-ms98-a-0020 103.686375 107.524000 i guess recommended it to somebody and see if they think it's feasible [laughter]
sw4078B-ms98-a-0021 107.524000 111.595125 so um what else do they do in the Dallas area
sw4078B-ms98-a-0022 111.595125 122.411500 [silence]
sw4078B-ms98-a-0023 122.411500 123.722250 uh-huh
sw4078B-ms98-a-0024 123.722250 127.426375 [silence]
sw4078B-ms98-a-0025 127.426375 129.023250 hm
sw4078B-ms98-a-0026 129.023250 154.948250 [silence]
sw4078B-ms98-a-0027 154.948250 156.997375 anything extra
sw4078B-ms98-a-0028 156.997375 158.688375 [silence]
sw4078B-ms98-a-0029 158.688375 165.768875 that sounds good there's i i've been wanting to put like two of three bins like right out my garage door where you know from the kitchen where
sw4078B-ms98-a-0030 165.768875 171.438875 you know you can throw cans in one or the glass in the other or the uh even uh [noise]
sw4078B-ms98-a-0031 171.438875 178.681000 there are areas that can recycle the the tin cans like your you know vegetable things come in and um
sw4078B-ms98-a-0032 178.681000 188.017000 [noise] so i i've not done that but that's kind of what i wanna set up so because we do go through aluminum cans you know that's probably the one we use most
sw4078B-ms98-a-0033 188.017000 189.756750 uh but
sw4078B-ms98-a-0034 189.756750 194.613625 [silence]
sw4078B-ms98-a-0035 194.613625 196.013625 [noise]
sw4078B-ms98-a-0036 196.013625 200.467375 [silence]
sw4078B-ms98-a-0037 200.467375 202.673000 find a place [noise]
sw4078B-ms98-a-0038 202.673000 204.727750 [silence]
sw4078B-ms98-a-0039 204.727750 206.999500 well um
sw4078B-ms98-a-0040 206.999500 209.161750 [noise] uh
sw4078B-ms98-a-0041 209.161750 214.044125 they they do have facilities for recycling the newspapers aluminum cans
sw4078B-ms98-a-0042 214.044125 224.783500 those are the two major items now we can take oil like car oil recycled oil to they have uh dump areas like at the fire departments throughout town
sw4078B-ms98-a-0043 224.783500 234.635250 um i don't know that they yet have the facilities here to do the tin cans uh i think they can do the plastics like the liter bottles things like that
sw4078B-ms98-a-0044 234.635250 241.810375 um but i- i don't know i know for sure though they have the newspaper and the aluminum can and then the oil at the fire departments
sw4078B-ms98-a-0045 241.810375 243.383750 so
sw4078B-ms98-a-0046 243.383750 247.507000 [noise] i do that i think people are becoming more aware
sw4078B-ms98-a-0047 247.507000 260.535125 you know of of the waste and you know i- i like to see you know y[ou]- you drive through Burger King now and the bags are recycled paper and you know so you know i feel like people are more aware of it or becoming more aware of it
sw4078B-ms98-a-0048 260.535125 263.742250 you know like maybe it's making an impact [laughter]
sw4078B-ms98-a-0049 263.742250 270.416875 [silence]
sw4078B-ms98-a-0050 270.416875 280.862875 i'm not as good about searching something out like that but if i'm there and the choice is there i would probably take the recycled product
sw4078B-ms98-a-0051 280.862875 292.800250 so you know that's just where i probably need to be a little more responsible as a citizen wise you know looking or searching those out because you figure if we as the citizens do that then the manufactures and producers will start
sw4078B-ms98-a-0052 292.800250 294.730250 packaging it that way
sw4078B-ms98-a-0053 294.730250 296.279000 so um
sw4078B-ms98-a-0054 296.279000 298.402000 you know they're getting away from the styro[foam]-
