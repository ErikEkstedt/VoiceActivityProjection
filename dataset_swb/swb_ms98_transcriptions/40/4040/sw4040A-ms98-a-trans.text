sw4040A-ms98-a-0038 194.111750 202.405750 yeah we[ll]- well when i was stationed in Lubbock Texas uh they had a child care center right on base uh right at the school i mean
sw4040A-ms98-a-0039 202.405750 208.581125 and that helped out my wife because_1 she just went part time there and you know take a couple of classes a week but
sw4040A-ms98-a-0040 208.581125 215.986625 and uh i think it's a good dea[l]- deal but um like you were saying it's about two miles from the school and that's
sw4040A-ms98-a-0041 215.986625 221.925125 it's not going to be very good i think they should talk about putting one right on the campus itself
sw4040A-ms98-a-0042 221.925125 226.843625 [silence]
sw4040A-ms98-a-0043 226.843625 232.161750 well they kind of have this i think in a different building you know on right on the
sw4040A-ms98-a-0044 232.161750 236.707875 uh edge of the campus and everything where they really didn't get in

sw4040A-ms98-a-0046 238.412625 249.446375 [silence]
sw4040A-ms98-a-0047 249.446375 255.722500 oh yeah um um i think they used one of the existing buildings they already had 
sw4040A-ms98-a-0048 255.722500 259.940750 so you know it it worked out pretty good
sw4040A-ms98-a-0049 259.940750 266.541000 [silence]

sw4040A-ms98-a-0054 275.830125 282.922250 excuse me we pay for any you know the child care but we don't pay as much as they do off base
sw4040A-ms98-a-0055 282.922250 287.697375 uh i think the government should subsidize some of it you know
sw4040A-ms98-a-0056 287.697375 293.087500 to give the parents you know some break on on the money portion of it
