sw4040B-ms98-a-0024 77.095250 78.115250 [silence]

sw4040B-ms98-a-0026 79.915875 81.304875 [silence]
sw4040B-ms98-a-0027 81.304875 82.427875 uh-huh
sw4040B-ms98-a-0028 82.427875 86.498250 um gee i think [laughter] [noise] where where does she go to school
sw4040B-ms98-a-0029 86.498250 88.824500 [silence]
sw4040B-ms98-a-0030 88.824500 93.009000 uh-huh okay yeah i had a student who went there at one time
sw4040B-ms98-a-0031 93.009000 96.454875 but i think we're getting [laughter-off] the topic [laughter-so]
sw4040B-ms98-a-0032 96.454875 108.003875 so um [noise] let's see i mean i- i was uh rea[ding]- i read a lot of articles on child care back when it was when there was a debate in Congress over funding of uh child care centers and what should be done
sw4040B-ms98-a-0033 108.003875 120.571125 and i came out uh very much in favor of a tax credit approach where parents would be given a tax credit and they would select whatever services they wanted for their child rather than to have the government subsidize certain providers
sw4040B-ms98-a-0034 120.571125 121.629750 [silence]
sw4040B-ms98-a-0035 121.629750 130.044875 and uh that was i- i thought it was import[ant]- well i mean it is important uh that that people have the opportunity to select the service that they would choose
sw4040B-ms98-a-0036 130.044875 137.700000 because a lot of kids are in you know in centers we[ll]- well not really centers but they're being cared for by neighbors and uh
sw4040B-ms98-a-0037 137.700000 145.707125 uh that's the sort of the[y]- the[y]- they prefer it that way the parents do because they know the people who are caring for their kids and they don't have to take them_1 very far 
sw4040B-ms98-a-0038 145.707125 152.789000 plus about a third of the kids are in church run centers and there was a big church state controversy over whether the government could
sw4040B-ms98-a-0039 152.789000 161.126000 fund those are not i think they ultimately decided to but they placed a lot of restrictions on it so it wasn't clear that the church child care centers would want to go to the trouble
sw4040B-ms98-a-0040 161.126000 173.164125 um so uh anyway [laughter] i continue to be an advocate of the um of the tax credit approach now myself i'm not married so i don't have any kids and it's not a problem but uh 
sw4040B-ms98-a-0041 173.164125 180.496750 still i know a lot of people that do and uh you know i mean you you you really would[n't]- wouldn't um uh well i'm on
sw4040B-ms98-a-0042 180.496750 194.594250 gee i'm on the benefits committee at the university here and uh child care is a topic of conversation we the university started up a center this year but it's about two miles away from campus and i'm not sure it's going to be real convenient for people to take their kids over there
sw4040B-ms98-a-0043 194.594250 200.081625 [silence]
sw4040B-ms98-a-0044 200.081625 201.224250 uh-huh
sw4040B-ms98-a-0045 201.224250 202.486250 uh-huh
sw4040B-ms98-a-0046 202.486250 206.234750 [silence]

sw4040B-ms98-a-0048 207.027000 208.209125 [silence]
sw4040B-ms98-a-0049 208.209125 209.511875 right uh-huh
sw4040B-ms98-a-0050 209.511875 215.133000 [silence]
sw4040B-ms98-a-0051 215.133000 217.100250 yeah it's just a lot of time
sw4040B-ms98-a-0052 217.100250 221.171125 [silence]
sw4040B-ms98-a-0053 221.171125 227.578125 yeah well they say they claim that it's a better environment for kids than to be in with all the students [laughter]
sw4040B-ms98-a-0054 227.578125 234.166250 [silence]
sw4040B-ms98-a-0055 234.166250 235.386875 uh-huh
sw4040B-ms98-a-0056 235.386875 236.465500 yeah
sw4040B-ms98-a-0057 236.465500 250.229000 yeah i am sure that a lot of it had to do with how cheap it was to acquire the building if they would've built a new building then it would've i'm i'm sure it would have cost a lot more than if they uh if they put it down where they did where real estate's probably cheaper
sw4040B-ms98-a-0058 250.229000 255.589375 [silence]
sw4040B-ms98-a-0059 255.589375 256.132125 um-hum
sw4040B-ms98-a-0060 256.132125 259.205250 [silence]
sw4040B-ms98-a-0061 259.205250 266.628875 s[o]- s[o]- so what do you think about the about the child about the tax credit versus the subsidy approach which s[eems]- seems most appealing to you 
sw4040B-ms98-a-0062 266.628875 272.715250 [silence]
sw4040B-ms98-a-0063 272.715250 274.044500 yeah
sw4040B-ms98-a-0064 274.044500 275.461625 i think
sw4040B-ms98-a-0065 275.461625 276.682375 well th[e]-
sw4040B-ms98-a-0066 276.682375 282.082500 [silence]
sw4040B-ms98-a-0067 282.082500 283.510375 that's right yeah
sw4040B-ms98-a-0068 283.510375 291.687250 [silence]
sw4040B-ms98-a-0069 291.687250 299.906000 well i mean the[y]- they yeah the i[ssue]- the issue is whether they can uh take it off of their taxes or whether the government decides which centers are qualified the other pro[blem]-
