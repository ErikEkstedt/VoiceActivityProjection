sw4028B-ms98-a-0003 9.106375 15.406750 uh i would say the medical uh group insurance uh area as far as uh
sw4028B-ms98-a-0004 15.406750 19.267000 covering medical costs for yourself or family members
sw4028B-ms98-a-0005 19.267000 24.688625 [silence]
sw4028B-ms98-a-0006 24.688625 33.804250 yeah i thin[k]- i work for a a public school system district and uh [noise] so it's different than a company where
sw4028B-ms98-a-0007 33.804250 38.808375 most companies fund almost the entire thing where the school district does um
sw4028B-ms98-a-0008 38.808375 40.978250 the employee must pick up
sw4028B-ms98-a-0009 40.978250 51.556125 a greater figure in the way of uh costs but i[t]- overall um i've been pleased with it over the years i think the biggest frustration 
sw4028B-ms98-a-0010 51.556125 54.501625 is because of the cost of insurance
sw4028B-ms98-a-0011 54.501625 65.366875 going up every year our district has had to alter uh you know change companies or now we're on a managed care thing which has stressed a lot of people out although
sw4028B-ms98-a-0012 65.366875 69.117625 it has not disturbed me any how about_1 yourself
sw4028B-ms98-a-0013 69.117625 72.273750 [silence]
sw4028B-ms98-a-0014 72.273750 73.619375 uh-huh
sw4028B-ms98-a-0015 73.619375 82.540750 [silence]
sw4028B-ms98-a-0016 82.540750 85.114000 right yeah our district did that
sw4028B-ms98-a-0017 85.114000 93.394375 for the ninety one and the ninety school year or calendar years and i was in the HMO and um
sw4028B-ms98-a-0018 93.394375 94.433625 [silence]
sw4028B-ms98-a-0019 94.433625 102.996000 i- i was because my my same doctor you know agreed to be in it for uh they usually sign a contract or something and um
sw4028B-ms98-a-0020 102.996000 104.038250 uh
sw4028B-ms98-a-0021 104.038250 114.445375 i did have surgery last summer and i paid ten dollars when i went to see him that first day and i've never seen another bill so i- i have to say it really works but again
sw4028B-ms98-a-0022 114.445375 123.947500 i was fortunate because my doctor agreed to be in it uh if you've been going to a doctor for you know ten years or something and he elects not to join
sw4028B-ms98-a-0023 123.947500 128.264750 it can be very stressful for you know those people
sw4028B-ms98-a-0024 128.264750 135.566750 [silence]
sw4028B-ms98-a-0025 135.566750 136.786250 uh-huh

sw4028B-ms98-a-0028 145.544500 149.785000 right but if you you know have a family and and um
sw4028B-ms98-a-0029 149.785000 155.258625 everybody's gone to different doctors uh it is hard to give up somebody who you feel
sw4028B-ms98-a-0030 155.258625 164.762500 knows you and your body and your just has you know all the medical history and you feel comfortable with it i i'm sure it would be very stressful and
sw4028B-ms98-a-0031 164.762500 174.238375 my husband and i have just elected that if that happens i will go and just pay you can continue to go to your own doctor but your benefits are not as
sw4028B-ms98-a-0032 174.238375 176.575375 you know good so [noise]

sw4028B-ms98-a-0041 202.544750 204.476750 [noise] i don't think
sw4028B-ms98-a-0042 204.476750 210.587375 most of our teachers now i'm not a teacher i am the a secretarial executive assistant but
sw4028B-ms98-a-0043 210.587375 215.647750 i don't think the teachers could stand the stress [laughter-all] all year long frankly it is just
