sw4030A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 5.189125 [noise] well we in our country seems to be involved a lot in the Mid East what do you what do you think
sw4030A-ms98-a-0002 5.189125 24.013125 [silence]

sw4030A-ms98-a-0005 26.212125 28.486750 it that that happens a lot doesn't it
sw4030A-ms98-a-0006 28.486750 31.489125 wars don't usually settle things [laughter] much
sw4030A-ms98-a-0007 31.489125 36.983125 um um and i i guess i i feel like we
sw4030A-ms98-a-0008 36.983125 41.613000 we keep getting into places without really understanding what we're doing
sw4030A-ms98-a-0009 41.613000 46.586625 uh which really i find upsetting because it seems like we've got experts
sw4030A-ms98-a-0010 46.586625 58.504125 and we've got people who understand these cultures but i always wonder if they're really used because it seems like then afterwards we have people explaining to us how if they'd only known such and such
sw4030A-ms98-a-0011 58.504125 61.256500 we wouldn't have done this you know
sw4030A-ms98-a-0012 61.256500 62.483250 and would

sw4030A-ms98-a-0025 102.933000 104.313875 oh
sw4030A-ms98-a-0026 104.313875 111.008375 [silence]

sw4030A-ms98-a-0030 116.081375 119.035625 [silence]
sw4030A-ms98-a-0031 119.035625 122.491375 on our hi[t]- on our really bad list [laughter]

sw4030A-ms98-a-0033 125.489000 139.491375 and i i i keep reading about Jordan's King Hussein and i just feel so sorry for him sort of in the middle of all of this trying to keep some sort of sanity living vulnerable right where he is
sw4030A-ms98-a-0034 139.491375 152.500500 [silence]
sw4030A-ms98-a-0035 152.500500 155.409875 r[ight]- yes yes right

sw4030A-ms98-a-0038 163.039000 169.530500 of doing that either no [laughter] no i i i i just get a sense of our
sw4030A-ms98-a-0039 169.530500 176.858500 walking in over and over and over again in places where we weren't well versed or something
sw4030A-ms98-a-0040 176.858500 182.728250 didn't didn't know what we were doing so i mean it just feels unprepared or
sw4030A-ms98-a-0041 182.728250 189.527875 something and and if we could it's not wise that i guess i'm still looking for a statesman
sw4030A-ms98-a-0042 189.527875 199.006375 you know someone who really the the the kind of stories you hear about or you look back in history these people really understood what they're doing and did this wise thing every once in a while
sw4030A-ms98-a-0043 199.006375 211.234625 and i just keep thinking i know there with all the resources we have there must be people who could have explained some of this and said if you do this subtle thing understanding their culture et cetera et cetera it'll have this effect but
sw4030A-ms98-a-0044 211.234625 244.547125 [silence]
sw4030A-ms98-a-0045 244.547125 246.918875 oh absolutely yes
sw4030A-ms98-a-0046 246.918875 252.319875 i mean wh[ich]- which was uh in the line of business that i'm in which is mediation [laughter]
sw4030A-ms98-a-0047 252.319875 264.487625 every absolutely everything he did i mean i was in the classrooms teaching children about how to do negotiating and mediating and every single thing we did was against every principle i was teaching it was like
sw4030A-ms98-a-0048 264.487625 265.491625 um
sw4030A-ms98-a-0049 265.491625 266.495625 [silence]
sw4030A-ms98-a-0050 266.495625 267.378250 yes
sw4030A-ms98-a-0051 267.378250 272.219000 it was emotionally quite difficult uh to say the least because it's sort of like
sw4030A-ms98-a-0052 272.219000 276.933375 golly gee this is a set up for absolutely the worst chance
sw4030A-ms98-a-0053 276.933375 284.269625 possible what are what are we doing here you back someone in the corner is it too surprising if they come out fighting
sw4030A-ms98-a-0054 284.269625 288.437625 i mean uh ah didn't you ever see that with children i mean [laughter-don't]

sw4030A-ms98-a-0056 295.620000 299.394000 something like George and Sa[ddam]- and Saddam go home
