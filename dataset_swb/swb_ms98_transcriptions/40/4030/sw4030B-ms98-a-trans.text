sw4030B-ms98-a-0018 75.132500 84.683125 in terms of and and it seems to me that our policy basically seems to be uh the enemy of my enemy is my friend
sw4030B-ms98-a-0019 84.683125 86.477500 and that that
sw4030B-ms98-a-0020 86.477500 91.272750 Saddam Hussein was uh was our buddy buddy as long as he was against Iran
sw4030B-ms98-a-0021 91.272750 97.461125 and uh Iran was our bigger enemy and then [laughter] when it turns out that uh Saddam Hussein

sw4030B-ms98-a-0027 108.430625 113.031625 oh what's his name in uh Syria uh
sw4030B-ms98-a-0028 113.031625 124.751125 uh Hafaia Susaad i believe uh is suddenly our friend even though he was he was on our our leading terrorist yeah our leading terrorist list so uh

sw4030B-ms98-a-0050 225.031250 230.684875 i uh felt that was displayed in terms of of uh Iraq in particular
sw4030B-ms98-a-0051 230.684875 236.658000 was that it seemed to me that George Bush was was trying to play the peacemaker in such a way that
sw4030B-ms98-a-0052 236.658000 245.476625 that he was guaranteeing that given their culture that Saddam Hussein could not back down and would not could not do anything but go to war
