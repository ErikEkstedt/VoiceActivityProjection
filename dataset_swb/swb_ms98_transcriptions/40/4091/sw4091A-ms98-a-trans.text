sw4091A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 2.344250 [noise] i guess that starts it um
sw4091A-ms98-a-0002 2.344250 9.369375 so um i guess right now what's most important for me uh doing is coming up is we have a really good stock program
sw4091A-ms98-a-0003 9.369375 13.930625 uh where i work and it's gonna give me about a three hundred percent return
sw4091A-ms98-a-0004 13.930625 17.270375 this time around on my uh investment
sw4091A-ms98-a-0005 17.270375 20.730875 which is definitely helping since i'm gonna buy a house
sw4091A-ms98-a-0006 20.730875 22.185500 [silence]
sw4091A-ms98-a-0007 22.185500 25.501500 yeah what they do i[s]- what they do is it's it's a purchase program
sw4091A-ms98-a-0008 25.501500 33.235875 where you get the stock i[t's]- i[t's]- it's on a one year cycle and you get it at eighty five percent of the lower of the beginning and the end price for the year
sw4091A-ms98-a-0009 33.235875 37.713000 so like the the set price at the beginning of the year last May was five sixty four a share
sw4091A-ms98-a-0010 37.713000 40.217375 stocks trading about fourteen now
sw4091A-ms98-a-0011 40.217375 44.128875 so and you so i'll get to buy it at five sixty f[our]- four and turn around the same day
sw4091A-ms98-a-0012 44.128875 52.389750 the only down side is they do it as a withholding off your uh income so you got to kind of you know be willing to squirrel away at whatever you wanna do
sw4091A-ms98-a-0013 52.389750 54.998250 [silence]
sw4091A-ms98-a-0014 54.998250 56.345875 yeah
sw4091A-ms98-a-0015 56.345875 58.259625 that's with Interleaf
sw4091A-ms98-a-0016 58.259625 60.141000 Interleaf
sw4091A-ms98-a-0017 60.141000 62.243000 uh desktop publishing
sw4091A-ms98-a-0018 62.243000 63.276250 [silence]
sw4091A-ms98-a-0019 63.276250 64.164125 so
sw4091A-ms98-a-0020 64.164125 65.226875 [silence]
sw4091A-ms98-a-0021 65.226875 67.002750 but um you know
sw4091A-ms98-a-0022 67.002750 69.277000 [silence]
sw4091A-ms98-a-0023 69.277000 71.720375 yeah benefits other than salary
sw4091A-ms98-a-0024 71.720375 74.511875 [silence]
sw4091A-ms98-a-0025 74.511875 76.060000 [noise] um-hum
sw4091A-ms98-a-0026 76.060000 79.030750 [silence]
sw4091A-ms98-a-0027 79.030750 83.461375 yeah but that that's definitely a good thing to have [vocalized-noise] especially these days
sw4091A-ms98-a-0028 83.461375 92.902625 [silence]
sw4091A-ms98-a-0029 92.902625 94.121250 right
sw4091A-ms98-a-0030 94.121250 97.930875 [silence]
sw4091A-ms98-a-0031 97.930875 102.943500 what is what is that like a uh like a [noise] uh [vocalized-noise] TIACREF type thing
sw4091A-ms98-a-0032 102.943500 104.205250 [silence]
sw4091A-ms98-a-0033 104.205250 107.677375 okay yeah [vocalized-noise] so it's for retirement
sw4091A-ms98-a-0034 107.677375 110.833875 yeah so you you have to wait until like [vocalized-noise] fifty five or
sw4091A-ms98-a-0035 110.833875 119.130625 [silence]
sw4091A-ms98-a-0036 119.130625 120.875750 right
sw4091A-ms98-a-0037 120.875750 124.173750 yeah we we we've got a 401K here
sw4091A-ms98-a-0038 124.173750 135.052750 but um i chose to go into the stock program because you can't lose on it and you know i can always take the money off of that if i wasn't saving up for the house i would be putting money into a 401K
sw4091A-ms98-a-0039 135.052750 141.983375 but you know i'd much [laughter-rather] get the eight[een]- eighteen percent minimum return on the stock and use that for the house
sw4091A-ms98-a-0040 141.983375 143.088125 [silence]
sw4091A-ms98-a-0041 143.088125 150.403500 but yeah you know me[dical]- medical is good you know we get a good program here what's basically a hundred percent coverage for about twenty bucks a month
sw4091A-ms98-a-0042 150.403500 156.764125 [noise] it's like your yeah it is it's a very good company as far as benefits go they've got 401K's they've got uh
sw4091A-ms98-a-0043 156.764125 168.626500 the health coverage they've got you know the stock program they've got uh 125K selling it for twenty bucks they do put it in the d[ental]- you know dental is like you know eighty or fifty percent depending on what you're doing
sw4091A-ms98-a-0044 168.626500 174.940000 um and you know you the 125K means i can pay that piece out of pre tax money rather than post tax
sw4091A-ms98-a-0045 174.940000 175.945750 [silence]
sw4091A-ms98-a-0046 175.945750 187.973125 the only problem with 125K is you got to say at the beginning of the year i think i'm gonna have a thousand dollars of expenses this year and then you have to be willing to have that money deducted from your salary and if you don't use the thousand dollars it goes away
sw4091A-ms98-a-0047 187.973125 190.784250 [silence]
sw4091A-ms98-a-0048 190.784250 196.968750 so at the end of the year if you haven't used it all up it's you know the feds take it or or whoever takes it it just disappears
sw4091A-ms98-a-0049 196.968750 208.089750 but you know if if you know you know so you wanna underestimate a little bit so like you know i know i easily have a thousand dollars or five hundred dollars a year of dental and and misce[llaneous]- miscellaneous medical and deductibles 
sw4091A-ms98-a-0050 208.089750 218.111375 so i just have them_1 pull you know five hundred it means i pay like you know as opposed to paying like you know eight hundred dollars i pay or five hundred i pay like three hundred because_1 it's on pre tax
sw4091A-ms98-a-0051 218.111375 221.924250 [silence]
sw4091A-ms98-a-0052 221.924250 223.278000 yeah i'm here
sw4091A-ms98-a-0053 223.278000 224.786875 [silence]
sw4091A-ms98-a-0054 224.786875 226.369875 yeah
sw4091A-ms98-a-0055 226.369875 227.979125 yeah
sw4091A-ms98-a-0056 227.979125 239.024875 [silence]
sw4091A-ms98-a-0057 239.024875 250.867375 yeah i i think it it depends how flat the organization is if you know [noise] hang on my computer is talking to me um you know it depends how flat it is if it's um
sw4091A-ms98-a-0058 250.867375 254.098750 i don't like working in an organization where you're really deep in the tree
sw4091A-ms98-a-0059 254.098750 258.717000 because_1 then you start to feel like you've got no real you know power to change anything
sw4091A-ms98-a-0060 258.717000 263.931125 [silence]
sw4091A-ms98-a-0061 263.931125 265.317625 right
sw4091A-ms98-a-0062 265.317625 269.125625 [silence]
sw4091A-ms98-a-0063 269.125625 270.249375 um-hum
sw4091A-ms98-a-0064 270.249375 271.526375 [silence]
sw4091A-ms98-a-0065 271.526375 272.889250 um-hum
sw4091A-ms98-a-0066 272.889250 274.253000 um-hum
sw4091A-ms98-a-0067 274.253000 287.749375 [silence]
sw4091A-ms98-a-0068 287.749375 297.954000 yeah but there's two sides to that because also you know i've seen a lot of i knew somebody who worked for Digital and for two years he worked on like you know the tape driver for one tape drive and that's all he did
