sw4090B-ms98-a-0029 133.675750 143.690500 the unnecessary expenses [laughter] we were before we started doing that kind of a thing we were um spending uh
sw4090B-ms98-a-0030 143.690500 146.199625 money for things that
sw4090B-ms98-a-0031 146.199625 156.779000 you know we probably tended to eat out a bit more than the than we should have and it was easy to uh let things get out of hand we thought it uh
sw4090B-ms98-a-0032 156.779000 161.525750 thought it to be really helpful we've gotten some of our loans paid off early
sw4090B-ms98-a-0033 161.525750 164.626500 because of this and and stuff like that so

sw4090B-ms98-a-0046 217.815500 226.816500 you know we tend to fudge on the budget a little bit it's just to [laughter-uh] uh get out the money in advance and put it in uh
sw4090B-ms98-a-0047 226.816500 235.221500 um so long as it wasn't you know unreasonably high but for things like food expenses or or whatever just put it in a
sw4090B-ms98-a-0048 235.221500 242.483000 in an envelope or whatever and that way it kind of forced us to uh stick to that amount
