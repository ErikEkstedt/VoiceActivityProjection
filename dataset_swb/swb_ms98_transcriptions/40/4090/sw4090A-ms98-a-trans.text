sw4090A-ms98-a-0013 48.219125 49.488875 um
sw4090A-ms98-a-0014 49.488875 51.069125 [noise]
sw4090A-ms98-a-0015 51.069125 57.948000 [noise] well that's basically what we do um about every every three months or so
sw4090A-ms98-a-0016 57.948000 65.974750 we reevaluate our budget and we sit down and just write from the largest bills down to the smallest
sw4090A-ms98-a-0017 65.974750 69.652500 and then we divvy them up between
sw4090A-ms98-a-0018 69.652500 82.106625 our four pay checks i work part time at night and he works and my husband works full time days and so we have the four pay checks with that works out nice because we get paid every week
sw4090A-ms98-a-0019 82.106625 85.858375 and so that does help that helps a lot
sw4090A-ms98-a-0020 85.858375 94.321875 and then um we don't have a lot ex[tra]- extra for extra spending so it's pretty well [laughter] earmarked 
sw4090A-ms98-a-0021 94.321875 102.857375 yeah [laughter] ev[ery]- every penny is earmarked but um it we have found that that works the best and
sw4090A-ms98-a-0022 102.857375 108.323375 and so if we can just divide them up all the major bills up in fact we
sw4090A-ms98-a-0023 108.323375 118.406875 found it easier to divide the major bills up you know cut the house payment in half and cut the loan payment in half and and divide those up between all
sw4090A-ms98-a-0024 118.406875 126.397500 um-hum and so we are not taking a huge sum out out of one and then the next pay check we're real short or
sw4090A-ms98-a-0025 126.397500 127.914750 [silence]

sw4090A-ms98-a-0036 166.242250 173.408250 where your money goes and and i'm sure you felt the s[ame]- the same frustration before you got on a budget but
sw4090A-ms98-a-0037 173.408250 183.941125 you're wondering my when you put down all the money that you do bring in and then you're saying my word where did all that money go where does it go
sw4090A-ms98-a-0038 183.941125 188.981125 huh and also we have found that if we write down
sw4090A-ms98-a-0039 188.981125 198.090375 a[nd]- and we did this we're not real consistent with this but we did it for about a month and we wrote down everything that we bought with you know
sw4090A-ms98-a-0040 198.090375 199.587500 every paycheck
sw4090A-ms98-a-0041 199.587500 204.737125 and so we could see where every penny went and it was really interesting to see
sw4090A-ms98-a-0042 204.737125 211.046625 [noise] just what you do spend and and like i say we haven't been real consistent with it it's
sw4090A-ms98-a-0043 211.046625 213.660625 we should because_1 it does help
