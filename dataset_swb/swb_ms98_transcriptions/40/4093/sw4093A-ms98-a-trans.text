sw4093A-ms98-a-0003 3.280250 8.204875 yeah they do do random drug testing i i work in the defense industry
sw4093A-ms98-a-0004 8.204875 15.703000 and so they're they're they're pretty concerned about something like that although in my mind i don't
sw4093A-ms98-a-0005 15.703000 21.821125 i don't like the idea of having a having like a hit squad come in
sw4093A-ms98-a-0006 21.821125 30.939750 and suddenly like you know put my employment on the line over uh my lifestyle choices consi[dered]-
sw4093A-ms98-a-0007 30.939750 36.883750 i i don't think considering i don't think it affects my job and like nobody um
sw4093A-ms98-a-0008 36.883750 42.934500 nobody's life is at at risk i don't think they should really care what i do in my spare time

sw4093A-ms98-a-0010 47.534250 53.371875 i think i'm not i'm not really sure i think that they're worried that you might uh
sw4093A-ms98-a-0011 53.371875 59.209500 if if if you're a drug addict you could probably compromise government secrets or something like that
sw4093A-ms98-a-0012 59.209500 64.088875 but i i think it's a pretty conservative approach to you know uh
sw4093A-ms98-a-0013 64.088875 70.408625 uh things i think it's like a fifties approach to a to a an an eighties or nineties lifestyle
sw4093A-ms98-a-0014 70.408625 74.539375 [laughter] you know i- i don't know i think drugs are pretty pervasive in our society

sw4093A-ms98-a-0017 77.349125 90.857750 and yeah well also i what i think is a a problem is that there's a there's a lot of things out there that will actually ma[ke]- let you test positive for drugs when you're you're not even
sw4093A-ms98-a-0018 90.857750 93.077625 like not even on drugs
