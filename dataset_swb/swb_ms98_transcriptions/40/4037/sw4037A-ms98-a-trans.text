sw4037A-ms98-a-0016 60.172625 65.745250 uh when i was in coll[ege]- when i was an undergraduate i was a member of Amnesty International
sw4037A-ms98-a-0017 65.745250 74.789875 and uh of course at that time you know i thought uh ho[w]- it's it was stupid to kill anybody for uh you know that the eye for an eye was a stupid argument
sw4037A-ms98-a-0018 74.789875 77.265375 but [noise] the uh
sw4037A-ms98-a-0019 77.265375 87.523250 the more now i live in [vocalized-noise] downtown Dallas and i uh [laughter] you know i've seen uh i've seen cases on in the news and all where where you know uh a a

sw4037A-ms98-a-0022 91.880750 94.000875 i think that [noise] maybe a
sw4037A-ms98-a-0023 94.000875 102.776750 a good solution to capital punishment might be uh reserve it solely for uh repeat offenders of a crime like uh murder

sw4037A-ms98-a-0025 104.789250 106.771125 yeah uh i-
sw4037A-ms98-a-0026 106.771125 116.601375 yeah it seems sensible and and fail-safe i- uh i- i don't you know not completely fail-safe but if a man's convicted of two murders uh you know there's a pretty good chance that something's wrong

sw4037A-ms98-a-0030 130.565625 137.441875 big time drug importers like uh say Noriega for example th[ese]- these people need to be uh eliminated uh
sw4037A-ms98-a-0031 137.441875 144.313250 from society and i think i think the death penalty is the best choice for those people because uh really any kind of uh
sw4037A-ms98-a-0032 144.313250 147.489250 uh jail sentence for them is just another chance to uh
sw4037A-ms98-a-0033 147.489250 149.453250 create another power structure [laughter]
