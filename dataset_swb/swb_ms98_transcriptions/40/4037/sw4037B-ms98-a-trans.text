sw4037B-ms98-a-0002 0.476125 6.419500 [silence]
sw4037B-ms98-a-0003 6.419500 11.232000 yeah we do have the death penalty here it's not exercised very often [noise] but we do have it
sw4037B-ms98-a-0004 11.232000 15.026625 i believe it i can't even remember the last execution we had here actually
sw4037B-ms98-a-0005 15.026625 21.536500 uh personally i'm in favor of capital punishment i know there's a lot of lot of problems with it but uh
sw4037B-ms98-a-0006 21.536500 34.502375 seems to me that some crimes are just so heinous that that the person just uh i feel doesn't deserve to live doesn't deserve for the tax payers to spend however many thousands of dollars it costs a year to keep them in in prison for life
sw4037B-ms98-a-0007 34.502375 35.582000 [silence]
sw4037B-ms98-a-0008 35.582000 46.831500 uh i know there's a lot of problems with that like well they say okay if you declare someone put them on death row and execute them well then ten la[te]- years later you find out that he really didn't do it then that life was wasted but
sw4037B-ms98-a-0009 46.831500 50.600125 just seems like in some cases that it's a it's a good policy
sw4037B-ms98-a-0010 50.600125 64.883625 [silence]
sw4037B-ms98-a-0011 64.883625 66.098125 uh-huh

sw4037B-ms98-a-0015 80.616500 81.871125 right

sw4037B-ms98-a-0019 102.034125 107.573000 that's a that's a thought that i had never really had on that wh[ich]- which seems pretty sensible
sw4037B-ms98-a-0020 107.573000 115.964875 [silence]
sw4037B-ms98-a-0021 115.964875 117.339375 right

sw4037B-ms98-a-0029 148.617500 151.923500 yeah you're you're right there uh
sw4037B-ms98-a-0030 151.923500 157.227125 i ju[st]- basically my views i guess they tend to be more economically oriented in that i just
sw4037B-ms98-a-0031 157.227125 166.393500 y[ou]- you know they come out with these figures that it costs fifty thousand dollars taxpayer dollars a year to keep someone alive in jail when they're going to be there for life they're never going to be rehabilitated
sw4037B-ms98-a-0032 166.393500 175.360000 i mean i don't believe that the prison system that we have today does much towards rehabilitation to begin with so to me i'm paying taxes you know twenty percent of my check or whatever
sw4037B-ms98-a-0033 175.360000 184.811375 to keep somebody alive who i in my mind shouldn't be there in the first place and is never going to be a valuable or worthwhile part of society so i i'm all in favor of it
sw4037B-ms98-a-0034 184.811375 196.807125 [silence]
sw4037B-ms98-a-0035 196.807125 210.829000 well i- i really don't know on that question it just seems like for instance the Jeffrey Dahlmer case i mean i- i don't really think that this person is going to ever be a worthwhile part of society i hope the guy never gets back out on the streets
sw4037B-ms98-a-0036 210.829000 216.066250 and in that case Wisconsin doesn't have a death penalty so he's going to be sentenced to life imprisonment
sw4037B-ms98-a-0037 216.066250 228.006375 and i think that that he should not be allowed to live but you know then you're kind of playing God [laughter] which is n[ever]- never a good thing to do but cases where i think the death penalty should be withheld
sw4037B-ms98-a-0038 228.006375 238.503625 uh not really that i can think of i i would i would be in favor of the death penalty in things like you know murders and like you said repeat murders or serial killers
sw4037B-ms98-a-0039 238.503625 245.980750 uh i don't really agree with the uh death penalty for people like Noriega and such as that i think that they're
sw4037B-ms98-a-0040 245.980750 252.644250 they're operating on a more i mean i know that they're causing massive problems in society up here but i don't really think tha[t]- that it's
sw4037B-ms98-a-0041 252.644250 261.135250 it's in our power to take these people from a sovereign state and say you don't deserve to live because they're feeding our consumer needs
sw4037B-ms98-a-0042 261.135250 272.362500 [silence]
sw4037B-ms98-a-0043 272.362500 273.702750 um-hum

sw4037B-ms98-a-0046 278.583500 280.937000 y[eah]- yeah that is very curious
