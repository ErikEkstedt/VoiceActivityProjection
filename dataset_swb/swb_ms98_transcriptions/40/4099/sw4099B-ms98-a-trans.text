sw4099B-ms98-a-0012 36.050375 50.063375 no it's really it's it's an aerobic routine you you warm up and then you have thirty minutes of aerobic activity starting you know slowly and then working up to uh you know a high heart rate and then you gradually go down again
sw4099B-ms98-a-0013 50.063375 51.150750 [silence]

sw4099B-ms98-a-0024 106.968875 109.530625 you know with with children between the ages
sw4099B-ms98-a-0025 109.530625 110.570125 [silence]

sw4099B-ms98-a-0037 144.321250 150.538500 well see that's that's that's really good and i think that keeps a lot some people from exercising
sw4099B-ms98-a-0038 150.538500 161.460875 i mean i don't have a problem with weight either but i think i don't have a problem because i exercise you know i mean people are always saying to me how do you stay thin and it's because i exercise but i also watch what i eat
sw4099B-ms98-a-0039 161.460875 168.768625 you know but you'll come b[eing]- being twenty seven you don't really have to worry about your heart rate and that yet but as you get older you will

sw4099B-ms98-a-0042 179.003500 183.552375 i just feel like you know you have to constantly weigh yourself
sw4099B-ms98-a-0043 183.552375 190.437750 and just keep an eye on it and cut back if it starts to get you know too high
sw4099B-ms98-a-0044 190.437750 193.160875 [silence]
