sw4047A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 5.323375 [noise] -[o]kay i guess we're on uh capital punishment uh
sw4047A-ms98-a-0002 5.323375 14.852750 m[y]- my feeling by the way is that i think there is a need for capital punishment i don't think it ought to be applied to every crime obviously but there is a need how do you feel about it
sw4047A-ms98-a-0003 14.852750 21.995250 [silence]
sw4047A-ms98-a-0004 21.995250 23.348500 uh-huh
sw4047A-ms98-a-0005 23.348500 24.718250 uh
sw4047A-ms98-a-0006 24.718250 40.394500 [silence]
sw4047A-ms98-a-0007 40.394500 50.550625 yeah i think it does does get uh strung out too long that they uh they keep people there ten twelve years uh uh that seems to be the norm
sw4047A-ms98-a-0008 50.550625 52.300125 um
sw4047A-ms98-a-0009 52.300125 57.913875 i- i don't know how effective a deterrent it is when when that happens uh but
sw4047A-ms98-a-0010 57.913875 66.794375 more and more people are being executed for crimes i think down in Texas uh just today or yesterday didn't you have one an execution down there
sw4047A-ms98-a-0011 66.794375 69.848000 [silence]
sw4047A-ms98-a-0012 69.848000 80.631250 yeah well they haven't executed anybody in uh in our state of New Hampshire since i think nineteen forty four or somewhere around that time frame it's it's been a long time
sw4047A-ms98-a-0013 80.631250 91.612750 we do have the death penalty but uh they don't use it very much instead they sentence them_1 to life and uh we end up as you say uh fitting the footing the bill the next forty or fifty years
sw4047A-ms98-a-0014 91.612750 102.685875 [silence]
sw4047A-ms98-a-0015 102.685875 105.695500 i think one interesting question would be uh
sw4047A-ms98-a-0016 105.695500 118.407250 uh you know as far as circumstances uh i think we agree if somebody you know is involved with a premeditated murder or you know a cold blooded first degree murder they deserve the death penalty that's in my opinion i don't know how do you feel about that
sw4047A-ms98-a-0017 118.407250 122.832000 if they take another human life you know and they've they've planned to do this
sw4047A-ms98-a-0018 122.832000 127.546625 or they're doing it for pay don't you think that deserves th[e]- the death penalty
sw4047A-ms98-a-0019 127.546625 140.006375 now how about drug dealers where they don't directly take a life you know it's not like they're pulling the the the trigger on a gun or or something like that what do you think about uh major drug dealers getting the death penalty
sw4047A-ms98-a-0020 140.006375 153.941625 [silence]
sw4047A-ms98-a-0021 153.941625 162.983750 i think capital punishment in those instances is probably even more effective than for uh the just the common street criminal that kills somebody
sw4047A-ms98-a-0022 162.983750 175.081000 that person probably isn't thinking too much about it but these major drug dealers uh you know they got some brains they wouldn't be in the business if they didn't have and if they're threatened with the death penalty i think it might make a difference on them_1
sw4047A-ms98-a-0023 175.081000 187.123125 [silence]
sw4047A-ms98-a-0024 187.123125 188.647000 uh-huh
sw4047A-ms98-a-0025 188.647000 192.842000 [silence]
sw4047A-ms98-a-0026 192.842000 199.667125 that's right it certainly ruins a lot of lives uh whereas a you know somebody that uh
sw4047A-ms98-a-0027 199.667125 207.294625 is holding up a bank and shoots somebody effects a fairly small circle of people i mean the relatives and friends of the person that was killed
sw4047A-ms98-a-0028 207.294625 213.323875 but but a drug dealer a major drug dealer is effecting what thousands of lives
sw4047A-ms98-a-0029 213.323875 216.793875 and in effect causing some of them_1 to die
sw4047A-ms98-a-0030 216.793875 226.693375 [silence]
sw4047A-ms98-a-0031 226.693375 228.325875 oh is that right
sw4047A-ms98-a-0032 228.325875 234.659875 [silence]
sw4047A-ms98-a-0033 234.659875 236.264375 uh-huh

sw4047A-ms98-a-0037 244.438000 252.999875 [vocalized-noise] that LSD even gets into the grade schools when they sell these uh stickers they look like uh i guess they're dots on a piece of paper or something
sw4047A-ms98-a-0038 252.999875 258.025125 and uh you know that's really that's really a crime to give it to the young kids like that
sw4047A-ms98-a-0039 258.025125 259.376125 [silence]
sw4047A-ms98-a-0040 259.376125 263.392250 well i guess we've talked about all we can on this topic what do you think
