sw4081B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 2.463500 [noise] [vocalized-noise] i'll talk about my city a little bit
sw4081B-ms98-a-0002 2.463500 10.532250 [vocalized-noise] i've noticed that there's actually being uh quite there's been a quite a bit done uh i noticed that uh the uh several of my uh 
sw4081B-ms98-a-0003 10.532250 20.962125 uh grocery stores have been putting up signs that plastic bags and uh trying to recycle the uh gallon uh containers
sw4081B-ms98-a-0004 20.962125 33.846625 so i i'm beginning to see some uh real positive effects i mean huh although i won't claim tha[t]- that the that that we're doing everything and it's uh you know i i try to recycle uh papers and cans
sw4081B-ms98-a-0005 33.846625 35.442500 [silence]
sw4081B-ms98-a-0006 35.442500 39.933000 uh i have not seen a whole lot of glass but the same time in this area
sw4081B-ms98-a-0007 39.933000 46.518250 at least when it comes to like uh Coke and Pepsi uh they don't really hardly use any glass
sw4081B-ms98-a-0008 46.518250 52.270500 [silence]
sw4081B-ms98-a-0009 52.270500 53.510750 uh-huh
sw4081B-ms98-a-0010 53.510750 67.043625 [silence]
sw4081B-ms98-a-0011 67.043625 68.381250 right
sw4081B-ms98-a-0012 68.381250 77.089000 [silence]
sw4081B-ms98-a-0013 77.089000 84.600875 right right well i i know that uh uh that's that one thing that uh they're not real good about yet is
sw4081B-ms98-a-0014 84.600875 85.690000 [silence]
sw4081B-ms98-a-0015 85.690000 97.222625 it seems like the paper sorting you st[ill]- we still are forced pretty much to take everything in you know we don't really have any help from the sanitation department
sw4081B-ms98-a-0016 97.222625 111.678250 so the life is not easy in that way we still have to kind of take care of our own aluminum uh so it's still up to the individual i[t's]- it's not really part of any uh a government sponsored programs or anything
sw4081B-ms98-a-0017 111.678250 115.101500 [silence]
sw4081B-ms98-a-0018 115.101500 124.720750 uh yeah uh pretty much i i really don't live in the same county as what you'd call Atlanta central but there's several counties that count as Atlanta
sw4081B-ms98-a-0019 124.720750 127.308375 [silence]
sw4081B-ms98-a-0020 127.308375 135.997500 you well that's Dekalb actually it's [vocalized-noise] you're right it's spelled that way D D E C A L B but that that's Dekalb [laughter] 
sw4081B-ms98-a-0021 135.997500 141.766750 [silence]
sw4081B-ms98-a-0022 141.766750 153.075625 right Fulton and actually also contained in that is Cobb and also contained in that uh to to some extent is Clayton county although it's pretty much uh still in the Atlanta proper
sw4081B-ms98-a-0023 153.075625 156.499000 uh but there's no concentrated concept
sw4081B-ms98-a-0024 156.499000 161.226000 uh on that sense uh we have uh
sw4081B-ms98-a-0025 161.226000 169.453750 [silence]
sw4081B-ms98-a-0026 169.453750 179.985000 yeah the the the central uh part of the city the downtown area is in Fulton almost exclusively
sw4081B-ms98-a-0027 179.985000 191.962375 uh but yeah i mea[n]- i- i uh most cities tend to stay most[ly]- mostly i[n]- [vocalized-noise] in in one county so you know 
sw4081B-ms98-a-0028 191.962375 199.918125 [silence]
sw4081B-ms98-a-0029 199.918125 201.016750 [laughter]
sw4081B-ms98-a-0030 201.016750 202.260750 right
sw4081B-ms98-a-0031 202.260750 203.948375 [silence]
sw4081B-ms98-a-0032 203.948375 215.479000 anyways i guess i'm trying to figure out what else there is out here i mean oh we do get papers uh we ge[t]- we get some help with the papers uh ou[r]- our our uh
sw4081B-ms98-a-0033 215.479000 227.990625 uh trash company does do a a uh uh if if you sort the papers and and put them_1 in a bag they will put them_1 in a separate area into into the uh uh 
sw4081B-ms98-a-0034 227.990625 232.861750 uh ga[rbage]- garbage truck i guess i don't know exactly how they do it but they do that
sw4081B-ms98-a-0035 232.861750 233.590500 [laughter]
sw4081B-ms98-a-0036 233.590500 239.373750 [silence]
sw4081B-ms98-a-0037 239.373750 247.596375 well it pre[tty]- well the the i guess it is in in in that sense uh it still is uh i don't i uh
sw4081B-ms98-a-0038 247.596375 253.832500 the uh the papers themselves i mean they some how put them_1 off to the side and i don't know exactly how they do it
sw4081B-ms98-a-0039 253.832500 257.549500 uh but they but they they do indicate that service
sw4081B-ms98-a-0040 257.549500 266.029750 i think that we you know i think they ought to really start pushing it more you know the idea that you were talking about where they they separate each each container
sw4081B-ms98-a-0041 266.029750 273.156625 that that should be more available we should have more containers in all city uh uh and all the grocery stores
sw4081B-ms98-a-0042 273.156625 277.383625 uh to help on on that sort of thing that would that would make it a lot easier
sw4081B-ms98-a-0043 277.383625 291.031625 i know in uh some cities that they actually distribute out they as part of the the service they give you extra containers that you can that you can put things into so you you know you don't have to go out and buy your own garbage cans and things like that
sw4081B-ms98-a-0044 291.031625 294.761000 [silence]
