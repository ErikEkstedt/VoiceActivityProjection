sw4067B-ms98-a-0012 45.338750 50.593500 and on the other hand it's kind of nice uh
sw4067B-ms98-a-0013 50.593500 56.243250 if you're taking care of an elderly person to have somebody come along and pick up the the uh
sw4067B-ms98-a-0014 56.243250 67.077875 the tab the the one thing that that mom got into was that was pretty nice was an HMO they took all the money from from uh Medicare
sw4067B-ms98-a-0015 67.077875 77.324625 how should i say it uh this HMO thing said uh had an agreement with Medicare that said uh on the average you're gonna spend X amount of dollars per year
sw4067B-ms98-a-0016 77.324625 84.481625 so if you'll give us that money we promise to take care of of uh all the bills

sw4067B-ms98-a-0021 95.230375 100.723000 so at one point uh and and that was pretty good for her because uh
sw4067B-ms98-a-0022 100.723000 105.955375 there was a set of things that she knew she was covered for and uh and
sw4067B-ms98-a-0023 105.955375 109.061875 [silence]

sw4067B-ms98-a-0027 117.339500 124.227250 [noise] let's see they bought her a wheelchair and uh one one thing that was good about it was that it uh
sw4067B-ms98-a-0028 124.227250 135.155625 uh before that time she was always subject she she'd have these salesmen that would call and say hey if you'll just buy this handy dandy motorized uh easy chair for
sw4067B-ms98-a-0029 135.155625 144.671625 three times the the real price uh Medicare will pay for it and so she was always buying stuff that she didn't need
sw4067B-ms98-a-0030 144.671625 151.103375 and then finding out that Medicare was either going to pay just a small fraction or no Medicare wouldn't pay for it
sw4067B-ms98-a-0031 151.103375 155.459250 so it kind of put the uh salesmen at bay put it that way
