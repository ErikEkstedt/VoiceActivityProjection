sw4067A-ms98-a-0029 160.310375 166.112250 i guess in terms of where do you is your mother now in a a nursing home is [vocalized-noise]
sw4067A-ms98-a-0030 166.112250 173.721125 [silence]
sw4067A-ms98-a-0031 173.721125 175.678750 right i guess
sw4067A-ms98-a-0032 175.678750 184.789625 that's the big question is um what what happens when they begin to get older i have a grandmother and it she's not really
sw4067A-ms98-a-0033 184.789625 195.205375 uh you know she's getting to the point where she almost can't be in a nursing home she spent some time with my parents some time now she's with an uncle of mine living with them
sw4067A-ms98-a-0034 195.205375 202.092500 but she requires a lot of attention and she can't really exist on her own any longer
sw4067A-ms98-a-0035 202.092500 208.964875 and that's that's kind of a difficult situation that that she has to live with one of her children

sw4067A-ms98-a-0040 229.356625 242.191375 yeah my uh my grandmother is hers is physically she's in not too bad of shape she's in her upper eighties i guess forgetting in my order but uh she's uh Alzheimer's i guess
sw4067A-ms98-a-0041 242.191375 252.686250 and so her memory is very poor [laughter] and so she can't really be on her own but she can still do things by herself but you just have to uh kind of direct her [laughter]
sw4067A-ms98-a-0042 252.686250 284.537875 [silence]
