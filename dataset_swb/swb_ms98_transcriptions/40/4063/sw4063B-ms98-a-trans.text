sw4063B-ms98-a-0004 11.470375 12.956875 we try
sw4063B-ms98-a-0005 12.956875 25.120500 it's it's not as easy as i had thought it would be but last year i started keeping a total of our expenses and and where they were all going and i have uh a budget book that i use
sw4063B-ms98-a-0006 25.120500 29.052750 if you had a people that have personal computers it would be much easier
sw4063B-ms98-a-0007 29.052750 40.990375 but um and then at the end of the year i- i totaled up what we were spending say for groceries or or entertainment or things like that and then this year i tried to keep it within
sw4063B-ms98-a-0008 40.990375 52.255000 you know a bounds there and then if there's if we are over budget in one item if we want to apply that to another one i try to do that but it's not always
sw4063B-ms98-a-0009 52.255000 60.354875 easy when you have extra expenses say the car repairs came up this month things like that that you're not expecting
sw4063B-ms98-a-0010 60.354875 65.976125 i don't really know how some people stay within a budget
sw4063B-ms98-a-0011 65.976125 68.688125 [silence]

sw4063B-ms98-a-0014 72.034500 77.506125 one we don't have any because_1 i thought if well if we had a [laughter-child] i don't know what we'd do
sw4063B-ms98-a-0015 77.506125 78.723625 [silence]
sw4063B-ms98-a-0016 78.723625 82.459250 but my husband gets paid once a week and i get paid every two weeks
sw4063B-ms98-a-0017 82.459250 91.342750 and uh then every three months i have a bonus check and but then that's when we we try to put some a side at that time
sw4063B-ms98-a-0018 91.342750 100.519750 as far as savings uh i take out of each pay check i put so much into a four O one K [pan/plan] in a profit sharing
sw4063B-ms98-a-0019 100.519750 109.998250 and then he does the same thing he puts one into uh a stock plan at his company and also into a retirement plan
sw4063B-ms98-a-0020 109.998250 114.656625 because to me that's the only way we're ever going s[ave]- to be able to save
sw4063B-ms98-a-0021 114.656625 120.060000 because if the money comes in it's spent if it's not taken out before i get it
