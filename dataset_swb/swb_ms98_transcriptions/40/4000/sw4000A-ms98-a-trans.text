sw4000A-ms98-a-0016 110.805125 123.634750 [noise] the thing is that both our cars are paid off but they are the same age and h[is]- my husband's car is American mine's Japanese but his is breaking [laughter-down] [laughter-a] [laughter-lot] [laughter-more] you know i haven't had any problems and were were 
sw4000A-ms98-a-0017 123.634750 129.678125 uh trying to decide well do we go ahead and get another car or do we just drive this one till it breaks
sw4000A-ms98-a-0018 129.678125 138.572625 you know and if we do what kind of car do we want to get and if we do do we should we pay cash for it or uh try to get a low interest
sw4000A-ms98-a-0019 138.572625 141.406750 y[ou]- you know interest rate 
sw4000A-ms98-a-0020 141.406750 161.133625 [silence]
sw4000A-ms98-a-0021 161.133625 162.506125 [noise]
sw4000A-ms98-a-0022 162.506125 166.797500 [silence]
sw4000A-ms98-a-0023 166.797500 172.465875 [noise] we both have done that um we both work at companies that have credit unions
sw4000A-ms98-a-0024 172.465875 179.575375 so we had direct deposit you know for our car payment anyway and when my car was paid off i never told them to
sw4000A-ms98-a-0025 179.575375 187.662625 you know to stop taking that money out so they've still been putting in oh i don't remember how much my payments were two hundred and fifty three hundred dollars 
sw4000A-ms98-a-0026 187.662625 189.008500 [silence]

sw4000A-ms98-a-0031 199.436250 203.388500 and then my husband has done the same thing with his payments
sw4000A-ms98-a-0032 203.388500 209.643625 so it's just more to us not necessarily setting up for another car but just going into savings
sw4000A-ms98-a-0033 209.643625 215.628250 and i- i think our thing right now is the way the interest rates are a[nd]- uh 
sw4000A-ms98-a-0034 215.628250 223.038500 well that's in our goals i guess for this y[ear]- first quarter is to examine our financial
sw4000A-ms98-a-0035 223.038500 235.416625 standing you know and try to decide how we want to invest our money because right now the the uh interest rates on everything seems to be so low that you know i don't really see any benefit over um uh
sw4000A-ms98-a-0036 235.416625 245.867250 [noise] oh i can't remember what we compared it to but over putting your money in say a CD or market money account or something over just a regular savings there wasn't enough difference
sw4000A-ms98-a-0037 245.867250 259.426250 in the interest rate to make a different i mean [noise] to uh i mean i guess our savings account is probably a lot more liquid than CDs or or um 
sw4000A-ms98-a-0038 259.426250 265.760875 money money markets i don't know what else there i know there are a bunch of different things you can invest in but
sw4000A-ms98-a-0039 265.760875 271.104125 [noise] right now i don't know what do you think the way things are going right now
sw4000A-ms98-a-0040 271.104125 272.248125 that 
sw4000A-ms98-a-0041 272.248125 281.927000 [silence]
