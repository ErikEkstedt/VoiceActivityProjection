sw4060A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.816875 [noise]
sw4060A-ms98-a-0002 0.816875 2.879875 okay Karen you're [vocalized-noise] you're first
sw4060A-ms98-a-0003 2.879875 9.937750 [silence]
sw4060A-ms98-a-0004 9.937750 11.324625 uh-huh
sw4060A-ms98-a-0005 11.324625 19.541625 [silence]
sw4060A-ms98-a-0006 19.541625 20.773875 okay
sw4060A-ms98-a-0007 20.773875 27.933375 yeah i guess one of the differences i see is uh working for a university uh
sw4060A-ms98-a-0008 27.933375 32.506250 there is room for advancement but not so much so our in uh
sw4060A-ms98-a-0009 32.506250 38.845625 quite a highly unionized environment and then also in an in administrative association so there is a
sw4060A-ms98-a-0010 38.845625 40.968875 progressive path but
sw4060A-ms98-a-0011 40.968875 42.665250 not being in the
sw4060A-ms98-a-0012 42.665250 47.128375 say the commercial sector the motivation isn't there for a lot of people
sw4060A-ms98-a-0013 47.128375 48.828250 uh like
sw4060A-ms98-a-0014 48.828250 50.223000 really [vocalized-noise]
sw4060A-ms98-a-0015 50.223000 55.417125 [silence]
sw4060A-ms98-a-0016 55.417125 61.955250 yeah somewhat that but then also there just isn't the ability to in one sense have uh
sw4060A-ms98-a-0017 61.955250 65.612250 a broader scope for rewarding people for
sw4060A-ms98-a-0018 65.612250 67.805750 uh their performances
sw4060A-ms98-a-0019 67.805750 70.353750 um so that's
sw4060A-ms98-a-0020 70.353750 74.622250 in in our situation where we're dealing with an institution
sw4060A-ms98-a-0021 74.622250 78.965125 uh it's a little more difficult to recognize an individual's performance
sw4060A-ms98-a-0022 78.965125 83.725750 and i suppose that's maybe a disadvantage of being in a larger institution
sw4060A-ms98-a-0023 83.725750 86.389750 perhaps somewhat even with the business
sw4060A-ms98-a-0024 86.389750 92.779500 uh but i agree you know the uh medical benefits and those kinds of things are
sw4060A-ms98-a-0025 92.779500 93.842375 one of the
sw4060A-ms98-a-0026 93.842375 97.970125 big pluses for working for a large organization and also the uh
sw4060A-ms98-a-0027 97.970125 102.155500 security aspect for long term employment uh
sw4060A-ms98-a-0028 102.155500 109.281125 [silence]
sw4060A-ms98-a-0029 109.281125 110.962500 job security yes
sw4060A-ms98-a-0030 110.962500 119.976875 [silence]
sw4060A-ms98-a-0031 119.976875 120.644875 uh-huh
sw4060A-ms98-a-0032 120.644875 126.535000 [silence]
sw4060A-ms98-a-0033 126.535000 132.858250 yeah uh we're seeing that here as well like in some of the large oil companies there has been massive layoffs
sw4060A-ms98-a-0034 132.858250 138.426125 uh so i i think there it's probably a major distinction between
sw4060A-ms98-a-0035 138.426125 141.449375 institutions and the corporate world
sw4060A-ms98-a-0036 141.449375 145.268375 in uh institutions are slower to
sw4060A-ms98-a-0037 145.268375 152.049375 react both on the growth side and then also on the reduction side where the businesses
sw4060A-ms98-a-0038 152.049375 154.478625 we need to cut back that's what we do
sw4060A-ms98-a-0039 154.478625 155.825500 but
sw4060A-ms98-a-0040 155.825500 159.070000 yeah and institutionally like here at the university
sw4060A-ms98-a-0041 159.070000 166.940125 oh if there is a cut back well gee it's not [noise] where it necessarily is needed it's where it's most expedient which
sw4060A-ms98-a-0042 166.940125 171.402750 [silence]
sw4060A-ms98-a-0043 171.402750 178.127125 well in one s[ense]- sense for us it's where it makes the least noise which means it's often the lowest support type roles
sw4060A-ms98-a-0044 178.127125 179.131750 [silence]
sw4060A-ms98-a-0045 179.131750 180.916750 so we end
sw4060A-ms98-a-0046 180.916750 184.536000 [silence]
sw4060A-ms98-a-0047 184.536000 186.317500 it's very easy
sw4060A-ms98-a-0048 186.317500 192.467000 [silence]
sw4060A-ms98-a-0049 192.467000 193.743250 yeah
sw4060A-ms98-a-0050 193.743250 197.952125 [silence]
sw4060A-ms98-a-0051 197.952125 201.435000 right because it's the support people that are providing the speed for it
sw4060A-ms98-a-0052 201.435000 205.638250 [silence]
sw4060A-ms98-a-0053 205.638250 206.433875 well
sw4060A-ms98-a-0054 206.433875 207.523500 [noise]
sw4060A-ms98-a-0055 207.523500 209.123875 the uh
sw4060A-ms98-a-0056 209.123875 212.980625 uh th[at's]- that's maybe the majority of the importance i guess
sw4060A-ms98-a-0057 212.980625 216.769125 uh yeah because my perspective is from an institution
sw4060A-ms98-a-0058 216.769125 220.557500 uh the there is not much incentive for
sw4060A-ms98-a-0059 220.557500 226.633625 innovativeness because the the limitation for reward is is very severe 
sw4060A-ms98-a-0060 226.633625 231.661125 but if you're in the corporate world i think there is considerable motivation for
sw4060A-ms98-a-0061 231.661125 233.167625 [silence]
sw4060A-ms98-a-0062 233.167625 235.838750 uh i guess in innovation although
sw4060A-ms98-a-0063 235.838750 239.058625 he the you know the more complex your structure
sw4060A-ms98-a-0064 239.058625 242.942875 the uh less difficult it is to kind of carry some things through
sw4060A-ms98-a-0065 242.942875 245.489250 but uh i think there is uh
sw4060A-ms98-a-0066 245.489250 247.342875 [silence]
sw4060A-ms98-a-0067 247.342875 253.506750 it's a long term type of process where in a small organization it's uh
sw4060A-ms98-a-0068 253.506750 258.057875 things can happen much more quickly and so you can see the reward of your efforts
sw4060A-ms98-a-0069 258.057875 267.977250 [silence]
sw4060A-ms98-a-0070 267.977250 268.995750 right
sw4060A-ms98-a-0071 268.995750 273.340625 [silence]
sw4060A-ms98-a-0072 273.340625 275.740875 yeah you end up being your own person
sw4060A-ms98-a-0073 275.740875 279.685250 and uh if you do your job fine and if
sw4060A-ms98-a-0074 279.685250 283.372500 somebody else is messing it up well then that's their problem and
sw4060A-ms98-a-0075 283.372500 284.439250 [silence]
sw4060A-ms98-a-0076 284.439250 285.926375 you know you really
sw4060A-ms98-a-0077 285.926375 290.694375 [silence]
sw4060A-ms98-a-0078 290.694375 294.684375 yeah yeah it becomes the organization instead of
sw4060A-ms98-a-0079 294.684375 298.765000 person being uh you know a part of the individual themselves
sw4060A-ms98-a-0080 298.765000 299.778000 [silence]
