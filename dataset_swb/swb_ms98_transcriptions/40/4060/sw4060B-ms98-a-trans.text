sw4060B-ms98-a-0014 48.787125 53.663875 are they like we[ll]- pretty much trained for a specific job and that what's their hired for and then uh
sw4060B-ms98-a-0015 53.663875 56.127125 j[ust]- just very little variation from there
sw4060B-ms98-a-0016 56.127125 67.102000 [silence]

sw4060B-ms98-a-0022 107.993875 110.449375 you mean security job security
sw4060B-ms98-a-0023 110.449375 112.159000 um
sw4060B-ms98-a-0024 112.159000 115.509625 that use to be i think a couple of years ago but i don't know
sw4060B-ms98-a-0025 115.509625 120.814250 if it is so much anymore in fact they we just had a lay off in what November i guess
sw4060B-ms98-a-0026 120.814250 126.084125 but um it wasn't necessarily i mean you know some people had been there a long time
sw4060B-ms98-a-0027 126.084125 131.883375 [silence]

sw4060B-ms98-a-0034 165.877125 171.145500 expedi[ent]- yeah that's exactly it yeah where the most dollar what it where it you know cuts back the most 
sw4060B-ms98-a-0035 171.145500 175.361875 [silence]

sw4060B-ms98-a-0039 179.835750 185.328875 yeah i think that's one of the things too you get too many management people you know
sw4060B-ms98-a-0040 185.328875 193.502375 yeah and it's very easy for them to say oh this is the best way when they really aren't aware of what all it took to get the work done you know
sw4060B-ms98-a-0041 193.502375 198.374125 and then they wonder why it doesn't get done in the same amount of time [laughter-when] [laughter-those] people aren't there anymore
sw4060B-ms98-a-0042 198.374125 199.610875 [silence]

sw4060B-ms98-a-0053 257.713250 264.527750 i think probably in a smaller yeah i was going to say more it's more personal for one thing you probably have a better team
sw4060B-ms98-a-0054 264.527750 268.716250 uh cooperation or team playing atmosphere
sw4060B-ms98-a-0055 268.716250 273.151125 probably where as in a bigger corporation sometimes i thin[k]- you think you're just a number you know
sw4060B-ms98-a-0056 273.151125 275.105375 [silence]

sw4060B-ms98-a-0060 284.516625 289.716875 whereas yeah in a smaller i think you'd be more willing to either help that person or help it
sw4060B-ms98-a-0061 289.716875 291.723375 get accomplished you know
sw4060B-ms98-a-0062 291.723375 298.215875 [silence]
