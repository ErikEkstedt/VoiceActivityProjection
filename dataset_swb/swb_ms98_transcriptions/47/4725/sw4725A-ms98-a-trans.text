sw4725A-ms98-a-0015 118.483125 120.130500 [noise]
sw4725A-ms98-a-0016 120.130500 126.479625 [silence]
sw4725A-ms98-a-0017 126.479625 128.534500 yeah i've blown yeah
sw4725A-ms98-a-0018 128.534500 141.331375 oh i i've got all four feet in a trough you know being a federal employee and and and so but but i can understand that uh that you know the uh who gets benefits like every every time there is a a bond issue

sw4725A-ms98-a-0020 143.734000 153.627625 i'm i but but but this isn['t]- this is tax not tax revolt country i mean there's too many every one of us most of us have our have all four feet in the trough
sw4725A-ms98-a-0021 153.627625 156.687625 you know plus our snout right up to our ears
sw4725A-ms98-a-0022 156.687625 164.550250 so you know it's not exactly that kind of a place that that that you wanna you know get into a tax revolt situation
sw4725A-ms98-a-0023 164.550250 175.031250 but uh um n[ow]- the um the local taxes here i- i i[n]- in this particular area um you know i've uh i think i pay about uh oh
sw4725A-ms98-a-0024 175.031250 187.480375 thirty five hundred for for taxes on my four bedroom house you know and which is a lot of money an[d]- and uh and so as as people get older and older uh you know they think about retirement and that sort of thing and
sw4725A-ms98-a-0025 187.480375 195.595250 and they they're building old peoples homes uh you know at tax expense sell i think you know the old people ought to just bail out of here and go where it's cheaper
sw4725A-ms98-a-0026 195.595250 204.860875 at thirty three hundred dollars at or thirty five hundred dollars i'm paying in taxes why i- i- i could go down to Bulverde and probably rent a rent a house for that right
sw4725A-ms98-a-0027 204.860875 211.337500 you know in[stead]- instead it's it's the taxes here so course i don't know whether i wanna go to Bulverde or not
sw4725A-ms98-a-0028 211.337500 214.806875 yeah or Seguin or someplace like that
sw4725A-ms98-a-0029 214.806875 219.586375 but uh there's certainly lots of inexpensive places where the services are poorer
sw4725A-ms98-a-0030 219.586375 227.941625 and i- and i think really the only place you can really reduce the amount of taxes you pay is to move to an area where the services are poorer
sw4725A-ms98-a-0031 227.941625 240.124875 if you're not gonna use them_1 then you wanna be in in an environment that's a strategy i think that that the people you know have to have to take is is how to be able to to lessen their cost of living
sw4725A-ms98-a-0032 240.124875 251.723375 you know and i'm i'm five six -[a]way [vocalized-noise] years before i'm eligible to retire and and i'm saying well you know i really can't stay here uh as a retiree it's too expensive
