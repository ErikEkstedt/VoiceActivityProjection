sw4716A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.930375 [noise] okay um
sw4716A-ms98-a-0002 0.930375 8.444625 i guess if i had to rate it from one to ten i guess i would rate it a five in the aspect that i wouldn't want everybody to have guns
sw4716A-ms98-a-0003 8.444625 20.733250 and i think there should be limitations of like semiautomatics uh things like that should not be just given out to anybody in fact you know i can't imagine anybody having a semiautomatic for what purpose
sw4716A-ms98-a-0004 20.733250 22.009875 um
sw4716A-ms98-a-0005 22.009875 30.595875 so i guess you know being that i come from a hunting family i'd rather have some restrictions put on weapons
sw4716A-ms98-a-0006 30.595875 41.375250 but yet allow hunting rifles uh things that people would use for sporting type of uh uh activity those would be fine but when you get into um
sw4716A-ms98-a-0007 41.375250 47.516875 a lot of the more complex weapons i would say yes we need to put restrictions on them
sw4716A-ms98-a-0008 47.516875 50.499625 [silence]
sw4716A-ms98-a-0009 50.499625 51.757750 um-hum
sw4716A-ms98-a-0010 51.757750 56.799000 [silence]
sw4716A-ms98-a-0011 56.799000 57.966875 um-hum
sw4716A-ms98-a-0012 57.966875 60.301250 [silence]
sw4716A-ms98-a-0013 60.301250 63.476375 exactly for f[or]- self protection sure
sw4716A-ms98-a-0014 63.476375 69.885125 [silence]
sw4716A-ms98-a-0015 69.885125 72.278375 i [laughter-can't] imagine that yeah
sw4716A-ms98-a-0016 72.278375 76.756625 [silence]
sw4716A-ms98-a-0017 76.756625 77.995500 um-hum
sw4716A-ms98-a-0018 77.995500 80.059375 [silence]
sw4716A-ms98-a-0019 80.059375 83.659375 to do massive amounts of killing uh yeah
sw4716A-ms98-a-0020 83.659375 88.981000 the only thing i can see is the police having it in a case where somebody is uh
sw4716A-ms98-a-0021 88.981000 97.016250 uh you know going to kill a massive amount of people or uh somebody that's escaping that's uh very dangerous
sw4716A-ms98-a-0022 97.016250 105.722625 semiautomatic would allow more rounds to be put out to hopefully catch a person and and uh get him down but um
sw4716A-ms98-a-0023 105.722625 116.616125 you know i i think of my family uh they're very much into sporting and uh you know as far as hunting and also like uh clay pigeons
sw4716A-ms98-a-0024 116.616125 127.625250 things like that so they have may have some shotguns they may have other types of uh hunting type things but i figured if the if the criminals had to take a hunting gun
sw4716A-ms98-a-0025 127.625250 133.348125 out to kill somebody more than likely somebody would see it you know what i'm saying versus a
sw4716A-ms98-a-0026 133.348125 144.415500 you know a small handgun um that can be you know put right in your coat pocket and nobody would see it but yet you can't stop people from having you know a handgun in their home
sw4716A-ms98-a-0027 144.415500 156.483000 even if there are small children around there's you know you can't say people with small children can't have guns and people without small children that may have grandchildren you know still have these guns but
sw4716A-ms98-a-0028 156.483000 162.611875 um i guess i i was always taught number one a gun isn't a toy
sw4716A-ms98-a-0029 162.611875 172.080000 um you know and i don't know if that makes a difference if the parent sits down to them_1 and say this gun can kill you you know and don't ever play with it 
sw4716A-ms98-a-0030 172.080000 175.980500 um so i don't know if that makes a difference or what but
sw4716A-ms98-a-0031 175.980500 181.949625 [silence]
sw4716A-ms98-a-0032 181.949625 183.237500 um-hum
sw4716A-ms98-a-0033 183.237500 185.705250 [silence]
sw4716A-ms98-a-0034 185.705250 190.994500 but criminals would get them i mean even if they had to go across borders to get them_1
sw4716A-ms98-a-0035 190.994500 195.617500 [silence]
sw4716A-ms98-a-0036 195.617500 196.941250 um-hum
sw4716A-ms98-a-0037 196.941250 203.887500 [silence]
sw4716A-ms98-a-0038 203.887500 217.616000 how to u[se]- you know to make sure that guns are put up as something as uh not a toy yeah because we had guns all over our house when we were kids and not that they were laying on the uh couch or anything like that but um
sw4716A-ms98-a-0039 217.616000 226.580750 i never had an interest in them being in the fact that i knew that guns could kill and i had four brothers and never messed with any type of guns
sw4716A-ms98-a-0040 226.580750 232.646125 and so it was kind of the idea that we knew that a gun could kill and that a gun wasn't a toy
sw4716A-ms98-a-0041 232.646125 240.346625 and of course we were quite young and we went through uh the National Rifle uh Club and so we were taught
sw4716A-ms98-a-0042 240.346625 253.068875 you know kind of at a a a good age ten and eleven and twelve to sit down with a kid and say okay if you gonna learn how to shoot a gun you're going to learn how to do it correctly and you're going to learn how to have safeguards and 
sw4716A-ms98-a-0043 253.068875 262.201500 and know how to protect yourself but yet have this you know training so that kids aren't you know they have to have a certain respect for it
sw4716A-ms98-a-0044 262.201500 265.729625 [silence]
sw4716A-ms98-a-0045 265.729625 267.209500 um-hum

sw4716A-ms98-a-0056 294.056125 299.522000 yeah i think so an[d]- and i don't know if the kids nowadays are different than what i- i can't ex[plain]-
