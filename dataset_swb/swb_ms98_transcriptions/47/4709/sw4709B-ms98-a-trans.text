sw4709B-ms98-a-0002 0.490500 7.204375 [silence]
sw4709B-ms98-a-0003 7.204375 8.402750 well
sw4709B-ms98-a-0004 8.402750 16.857625 as far as tangible benefits go i would say that uh health insurance of all forms is probably my next most important concern
sw4709B-ms98-a-0005 16.857625 22.886250 i feel that a company that can provide good health benefits such as health care dental and vision
sw4709B-ms98-a-0006 22.886250 29.150000 as well as good long term and short term disability plans uh goes a long way toward satisfying my needs
sw4709B-ms98-a-0007 29.150000 54.739500 [silence]
sw4709B-ms98-a-0008 54.739500 55.975250 right
sw4709B-ms98-a-0009 55.975250 59.597250 [silence]
sw4709B-ms98-a-0010 59.597250 66.737500 you you really don't realize how important they are until you find yourself on the other side of the fence without them
sw4709B-ms98-a-0011 66.737500 76.091000 and having to cover your own medical and uh you can quickly see where they become a very important part of your of your compensation package
sw4709B-ms98-a-0012 76.091000 92.782375 [silence]
sw4709B-ms98-a-0013 92.782375 96.317875 yeah they look at you say well you're still breathing so uh
sw4709B-ms98-a-0014 96.317875 100.800625 [silence]
sw4709B-ms98-a-0015 100.800625 102.092000 yeah
sw4709B-ms98-a-0016 102.092000 121.587375 [silence]
sw4709B-ms98-a-0017 121.587375 122.906000 right
sw4709B-ms98-a-0018 122.906000 126.305750 [silence]
sw4709B-ms98-a-0019 126.305750 128.899500 i suspect that it just disappeared
sw4709B-ms98-a-0020 128.899500 134.743000 [silence]
sw4709B-ms98-a-0021 134.743000 135.988250 right
sw4709B-ms98-a-0022 135.988250 137.659250 [silence]
sw4709B-ms98-a-0023 137.659250 142.737375 um i work for a little start-up company here in Pittsburgh called Trans Arc um
sw4709B-ms98-a-0024 142.737375 144.412000 have you heard of them
sw4709B-ms98-a-0025 144.412000 148.662750 they we do uh distributive system software
sw4709B-ms98-a-0026 148.662750 151.620125 for Unix based workstations
sw4709B-ms98-a-0027 151.620125 153.104500 so 
sw4709B-ms98-a-0028 153.104500 155.431875 [silence]
sw4709B-ms98-a-0029 155.431875 159.455500 ah yes yes fact my mom drives trucks so
sw4709B-ms98-a-0030 159.455500 160.695750 yes
sw4709B-ms98-a-0031 160.695750 161.756875 [silence]
sw4709B-ms98-a-0032 161.756875 168.770875 so yeah i see uh after the merger uh you see a lot of Ryder PIE stuff on the road
sw4709B-ms98-a-0033 168.770875 170.085625 [silence]
sw4709B-ms98-a-0034 170.085625 174.323875 so did did Ryder get out of the business is that what happened or
sw4709B-ms98-a-0035 174.323875 175.853000 [silence]
sw4709B-ms98-a-0036 175.853000 177.136000 right
sw4709B-ms98-a-0037 177.136000 179.490250 [silence]
sw4709B-ms98-a-0038 179.490250 183.555875 ah so that the merger pretty much ended the whole thing
sw4709B-ms98-a-0039 183.555875 193.664500 [silence]
sw4709B-ms98-a-0040 193.664500 205.939000 yeah and the the problem with that is you know when you leave a job you can continue your benefits for some finite period of time but when when the company goes bankrupt i mean the they're just cut off completely and you're responsible for your own
sw4709B-ms98-a-0041 205.939000 209.970000 and and that's exceedingly expensive 
sw4709B-ms98-a-0042 209.970000 216.323375 [silence]
sw4709B-ms98-a-0043 216.323375 217.685625 right
sw4709B-ms98-a-0044 217.685625 221.353750 [silence]
sw4709B-ms98-a-0045 221.353750 223.493750 it's definitely excessive
sw4709B-ms98-a-0046 223.493750 231.816625 [silence]
sw4709B-ms98-a-0047 231.816625 233.192500 true
sw4709B-ms98-a-0048 233.192500 234.889750 [silence]
sw4709B-ms98-a-0049 234.889750 240.951375 yeah they're starting to to cut back especially start-ups i know here at Trans Arc we get uh 
sw4709B-ms98-a-0050 240.951375 242.960000 we get
sw4709B-ms98-a-0051 242.960000 247.125250 health care and that's it and there's no dental or vision 
sw4709B-ms98-a-0052 247.125250 253.945000 and the the short-term disability policy is is a ninety day policy and there is no long term disability policy
sw4709B-ms98-a-0053 253.945000 260.173000 so you know at least in the case of this particular company they tend to scrimp a little bit there
sw4709B-ms98-a-0054 260.173000 264.022250 and you know of course they can use the excuse well we're a start-up 
sw4709B-ms98-a-0055 264.022250 282.940750 [silence]
sw4709B-ms98-a-0056 282.940750 284.480500 right
sw4709B-ms98-a-0057 284.480500 290.319875 [silence]
sw4709B-ms98-a-0058 290.319875 293.890125 well that certainly doesn't help matters any i mean you
sw4709B-ms98-a-0059 293.890125 299.458000 you get people who are willing to put their neck on the line to get you you know these additional benefits su[ch]-
