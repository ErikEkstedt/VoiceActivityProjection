sw4798A-ms98-a-0004 7.646875 11.046000 [silence]
sw4798A-ms98-a-0005 11.046000 14.334250 um in California yeah
sw4798A-ms98-a-0006 14.334250 17.031625 yeah so how do you feel about it
sw4798A-ms98-a-0007 17.031625 19.000000 about capital punishment
sw4798A-ms98-a-0008 19.000000 28.767125 [silence]

sw4798A-ms98-a-0012 53.959250 55.387750 [silence]
sw4798A-ms98-a-0013 55.387750 65.587500 well i've you know i- i kind of like you there's c[ertain]- certain crimes that i think it fits i'm for it generally speaking i think the thing that bugs me the most about it is that
sw4798A-ms98-a-0014 65.587500 69.683875 the process itself gets so drug out and so
sw4798A-ms98-a-0015 69.683875 80.878750 [noise] you know i understand you need to prove without a shadow of a doubt that the guilt and whatnot but the appeal process of it i think is what really bugs me if you're gonna make it go so long you know what's the use of it
sw4798A-ms98-a-0016 80.878750 91.210375 it almost becomes more more co[st]- you know to much cost and more trouble than it's worth you know to to put somebody like that to death or something that you know
sw4798A-ms98-a-0017 91.210375 100.730625 rather than just sentence him to life and forget all the hassle you don't have to pay the attorneys all those fees they get and whatnot because_1 i feel like you know sometimes it gets too drug out but
sw4798A-ms98-a-0018 100.730625 111.909375 i think i am i am basically for it with if you know if the crime of course fits it because some of those people this you got to wonder will they ever do anything i mean
sw4798A-ms98-a-0019 111.909375 114.250000 [silence]
sw4798A-ms98-a-0020 114.250000 121.423250 uh the time just comes that pure and simple you know you got to wonder if they're just a plain and simple menace to society or they gonna
sw4798A-ms98-a-0021 121.423250 123.365625 ever reform but
sw4798A-ms98-a-0022 123.365625 127.386875 [silence]
sw4798A-ms98-a-0023 127.386875 135.245500 yes we do uh-huh and i and it's been a c[ouple]- there was a oh it's been about fourteen years now there was a pretty hideous murder
sw4798A-ms98-a-0024 135.245500 149.773000 in a hi-fi shop where they murdered one person and they they the two people that did it they poured Drano down one guy's throat and they kicked a pen through another guy's ear and and all kinds of things like that and and of cour[se]- a couple of them_1 ended up dying and a couple didn't but
sw4798A-ms98-a-0025 149.773000 164.480375 ah one of the kid one of the two men involved was uh was was uh put to death oh about two years ago a[nd]- and like i said if it took about thirteen years for it to happen and the other guy is still sitting on death row you know fourteen fifteen years later
sw4798A-ms98-a-0026 164.480375 177.868500 and that's why you know like i say a part of my thing with the whole appeal process kind of bugs me because_1 here they have sat for you know fifteen years and i- i wonder about the families of the people who are the victims you know and they've got to be a little bit upset themselves and
sw4798A-ms98-a-0027 177.868500 184.635875 [silence]

sw4798A-ms98-a-0035 211.883125 225.143500 uh oh i for[got]- i lost my point but yeah that's like i say i think the the victims and just if that's gonna happen they they just wanna have it done and over with but you know i agree there's got to be some appeal process because
sw4798A-ms98-a-0036 225.143500 234.668875 it's almost you you wanna make sure in that situation that the person really did commit the crime uh you wanna give him every opportunity you possible can but uh
