sw4745B-ms98-a-0004 66.295500 75.178875 [silence]
sw4745B-ms98-a-0005 75.178875 76.591375 yeah
sw4745B-ms98-a-0006 76.591375 78.028750 [silence]
sw4745B-ms98-a-0007 78.028750 82.443000 i know that i have three children and um i stay home i don't work
sw4745B-ms98-a-0008 82.443000 94.494375 and um i know that it it must be really challenging to um try to juggle a job and and also your children because i know my husband if i were gone as much as he is
sw4745B-ms98-a-0009 94.494375 99.168625 we wouldn't have the influence on them that i would wanna put on them
sw4745B-ms98-a-0010 99.168625 104.591375 and i also notice that the children that come over here to play that go to day care every day
sw4745B-ms98-a-0011 104.591375 107.224625 they don't like to be around adults
sw4745B-ms98-a-0012 107.224625 116.503125 they don't wanna play around adults they don't want to be around you they don't want you to tell them what to do they want to do their own thing and they're the very same age as my children
sw4745B-ms98-a-0013 116.503125 119.942375 and i'm finding as i volunteer up at the school
sw4745B-ms98-a-0014 119.942375 134.753000 i just a being um i'm not educated at all in um really detecting this but i can talk to the teacher and tell them on a pretty good basis after i've worked up at the school for a couple of weeks which kids go to day care and which kids stay home
sw4745B-ms98-a-0015 134.753000 139.463875 and you can just tell in their personalities and how they respond to the adults
sw4745B-ms98-a-0016 139.463875 146.439250 that um the ones that are are home and the ones even that are home that are getting the love and attention they need
sw4745B-ms98-a-0017 146.439250 157.665375 not that the kids that go out aren't getting that it's just a different they're they are more used to being with their own age kids they're not use to being with adults and to responding to adults
sw4745B-ms98-a-0018 157.665375 165.510125 um i think the trend in the United States i feel really bad that it's turned so much to where the children are um
sw4745B-ms98-a-0019 165.510125 213.443250 [silence]

sw4745B-ms98-a-0027 278.330875 283.876125 [silence]
sw4745B-ms98-a-0028 283.876125 290.470000 right i think one of the things that people look at too though is um spen[ding]- how they spend their time with their children
sw4745B-ms98-a-0029 290.470000 298.850000 i think with working moms if you can get the ma[nagers]- the bosses to give you almost like a rotation like they're going to do with year round school where you work
