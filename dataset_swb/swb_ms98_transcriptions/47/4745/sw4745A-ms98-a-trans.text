sw4745A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 4.516750 [noise] um i don't know about you but uh i work outside the home and uh
sw4745A-ms98-a-0002 4.516750 11.101125 [noise] in fact uh i'll be leaving very shortly to go to work and i work different shifts so are pretty much a
sw4745A-ms98-a-0003 11.101125 22.907250 a later shift to where i don't have the family time uh when my husband gets home it's usually he's home with my daughter alone and then uh couple of hours later i'm home
sw4745A-ms98-a-0004 22.907250 35.691750 um i don't know i'm finding that more and more people that i talk to there's less and less family time available to them and uh it seems that business wise um
sw4745A-ms98-a-0005 35.691750 42.577000 in the business community or your employers seem to be taking more and more time away from the family
sw4745A-ms98-a-0006 42.577000 50.307375 so you know if you do have any time it's kind of like on a rush cycle that you have to get so many other things done
sw4745A-ms98-a-0007 50.307375 60.355125 um jus[t]- just to maintain your home and maintain the things outside your home and then plus try to have that relationship with your children 
sw4745A-ms98-a-0008 60.355125 65.434250 and it it's sometimes a very it's a it's a very hard juggling act
sw4745A-ms98-a-0009 65.434250 67.014750 and
sw4745A-ms98-a-0010 67.014750 75.921500 you know i look at my daughter and she's now uh four going to be four and i keep saying oh jeez i don't have that much time with her [laughter]

sw4745A-ms98-a-0037 155.354625 156.833000 sure
sw4745A-ms98-a-0038 156.833000 160.808125 sure yeah i agree to a
sw4745A-ms98-a-0039 160.808125 162.234875 [silence]
sw4745A-ms98-a-0040 162.234875 164.211375 i think so too
sw4745A-ms98-a-0041 164.211375 178.716625 in fact um i spent the first three years at home with my daughter so i- i guess i felt fairly fortunate that i was able to do that and i did notice the difference between those of infants being placed in day care and i thought to myself how can a mother
sw4745A-ms98-a-0042 178.716625 193.492250 place her child at the age of six weeks or four weeks or two weeks or three weeks whatever the employer says you have to be back to work is basically when you have to be back to work whether it be six weeks or three or four but how these women must
sw4745A-ms98-a-0043 193.492250 203.354625 feel to place their children into care and you know it's our society saying yes this um you need this job
sw4745A-ms98-a-0044 203.354625 215.566125 it's a little bit financial type thing because uh if you look all over in the other countries like Europe and that um their standards of living are a lot less than what ours are and that's part of it too but
sw4745A-ms98-a-0045 215.566125 225.345625 uh like my husband was saying maybe some of the problems we brought on to ourselves is that these women back in the nineteen fifties uh were staying at home with their kids
sw4745A-ms98-a-0046 225.345625 235.994125 and then made the decision well jeez you know i'll go out and get a part time job got a part time job and then financially they got themselves into well i'll have the boat i'll have the car and it's nice
sw4745A-ms98-a-0047 235.994125 242.897125 and really women past generation women have done it to women of this day and age too
sw4745A-ms98-a-0048 242.897125 247.978125 uh because it is now our financial situations are as
sw4745A-ms98-a-0049 247.978125 255.045625 it almost takes two people to bring in an income to support a family now and
sw4745A-ms98-a-0050 255.045625 258.138250 [silence]
sw4745A-ms98-a-0051 258.138250 259.432125 um-hum
sw4745A-ms98-a-0052 259.432125 266.301250 sure i did it for three years and uh it cost us a lot of financial problems doing it
sw4745A-ms98-a-0053 266.301250 277.318625 and pretty soon you know you're at the limit where you've got to say okay you've sacrificed for you know so many years at home and you're not getting any further you know along
sw4745A-ms98-a-0054 277.318625 286.145625 and you have to make that decision to go back to work part time or go back to work full time and you have to make that decision and it's a tough one and i
sw4745A-ms98-a-0055 286.145625 289.606625 [silence]
