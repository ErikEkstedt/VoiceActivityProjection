sw4784A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 6.867000 yeah i guess uh uh it's an easy one for me i think that's uh there's something seriously wrong yeah
sw4784A-ms98-a-0002 6.867000 11.116625 [silence]
sw4784A-ms98-a-0003 11.116625 12.493125 uh
sw4784A-ms98-a-0004 12.493125 16.664000 i guess uh i think they've lost their compass and uh
sw4784A-ms98-a-0005 16.664000 22.364250 i'm not sure they know exactly what uh uh public education supposed to be for anymore
sw4784A-ms98-a-0006 22.364250 23.869000 but uh
sw4784A-ms98-a-0007 23.869000 28.574500 i voted with my feet and uh my kids go to parochial school
sw4784A-ms98-a-0008 28.574500 31.029250 so um
sw4784A-ms98-a-0009 31.029250 36.242750 [silence]
sw4784A-ms98-a-0010 36.242750 37.543500 well
sw4784A-ms98-a-0011 37.543500 50.200750 one hundred percent of the uh customers care that's one thing everybody cares about the education the kids are getting and um they uh take an active relatively active part
sw4784A-ms98-a-0012 50.200750 51.759250 which uh
sw4784A-ms98-a-0013 51.759250 53.606500 i mean if you're uh
sw4784A-ms98-a-0014 53.606500 59.475000 sending two thousand dollars that way every year you uh watch what goes on and you um
sw4784A-ms98-a-0015 59.475000 60.968625 um
sw4784A-ms98-a-0016 60.968625 64.779125 pay attention and participate and and you can
sw4784A-ms98-a-0017 64.779125 66.849000 influence the way things are
sw4784A-ms98-a-0018 66.849000 83.811000 [silence]
sw4784A-ms98-a-0019 83.811000 95.400500 yeah the immediacy just isn't there and um [noise] uh i also think that o[ne]- one of the problems and actually i don't think this i think this is a cultural problem
sw4784A-ms98-a-0020 95.400500 98.793250 the uh problem with public education is really uh
sw4784A-ms98-a-0021 98.793250 104.506875 really a problem with the culture and i guess my evidence for that is the
sw4784A-ms98-a-0022 104.506875 114.798625 school districts in places like California for example where only a minority of the taxpayers have children in school and you can't get a tax levy passed
sw4784A-ms98-a-0023 114.798625 116.192500 um
sw4784A-ms98-a-0024 116.192500 127.375375 people are um reluctant to pass uh school tax levies even uh when the money is needed or would be well spent because it's uh they don't have kids in the schools
sw4784A-ms98-a-0025 127.375375 137.961000 i think that's a a loss of civic virtue and a loss of um [noise] uh the cultural attitude that we used to have that education was first even if it wasn't our kids
sw4784A-ms98-a-0026 137.961000 145.617500 i think that's uh that's the principal problem is that uh people no longer see it as uh as their problem and as an immediate problem
sw4784A-ms98-a-0027 145.617500 159.779625 [silence]
sw4784A-ms98-a-0028 159.779625 161.083750 right
sw4784A-ms98-a-0029 161.083750 169.072375 [silence]
sw4784A-ms98-a-0030 169.072375 170.384750 yeah
sw4784A-ms98-a-0031 170.384750 176.035375 [silence]
sw4784A-ms98-a-0032 176.035375 177.258250 yeah
sw4784A-ms98-a-0033 177.258250 179.321875 [silence]
sw4784A-ms98-a-0034 179.321875 187.264375 you know i i believe that the original idea of public education in the United States which i guess was controversial at the time of the constitution
sw4784A-ms98-a-0035 187.264375 201.721250 um [noise] you know it barely made it i think it was added afterwards [noise] i think the real the principal reason was uh education for civic participation the idea was that everybody should have an education so that they'd be a better voter
sw4784A-ms98-a-0036 201.721250 204.219625 and you couldn't pull the wool over their eyes
sw4784A-ms98-a-0037 204.219625 208.874375 [silence]
sw4784A-ms98-a-0038 208.874375 223.227000 well that's exactly what i was going to say now there seem to be really three reasons for education one is education for civic duty one is education for economic reasons and one is education for civilization i mean and i- i think that one is
sw4784A-ms98-a-0039 223.227000 224.466125 [silence]
sw4784A-ms98-a-0040 224.466125 233.910625 tha[t]- that's what i used to think education was all about when i was a college professor and then i quit and got disabused of that notion but um the um uh
sw4784A-ms98-a-0041 233.910625 242.852750 now the only thing people seem to agree on is that education is um an economic enterprise to um train people for jobs
sw4784A-ms98-a-0042 242.852750 257.038375 and um i'm not sure that people in the education establishment really know what their purpose is and i'm really sad to say this i never thought i would have but i really think that uh the educational establishment has become part of the problem
sw4784A-ms98-a-0043 257.038375 264.643750 and uh that's why i guess i'm sort of reluctantly uh in favor of these uh choice programs
sw4784A-ms98-a-0044 264.643750 295.529875 [silence]
sw4784A-ms98-a-0045 295.529875 297.858000 right that's what
