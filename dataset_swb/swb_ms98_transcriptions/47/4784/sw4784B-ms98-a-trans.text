sw4784B-ms98-a-0003 7.055875 10.795375 what is it that you are you know particularly
sw4784B-ms98-a-0004 10.795375 12.708875 upset about
sw4784B-ms98-a-0005 12.708875 27.998375 [silence]
sw4784B-ms98-a-0006 27.998375 29.310875 uh-huh
sw4784B-ms98-a-0007 29.310875 30.312500 [silence]
sw4784B-ms98-a-0008 30.312500 36.645625 what do you feel that your kids are getting in the parochial schools that they wouldn't get in uh the public school system
sw4784B-ms98-a-0009 36.645625 66.035375 [silence]
sw4784B-ms98-a-0010 66.035375 76.392750 so you're saying that the taxpayer who also is really paying through the pocket book for the education of the child may not be quite so conscious of the fact that they are paying the tuition for that child in the form of
sw4784B-ms98-a-0011 76.392750 85.270250 [noise] uh real estate or other taxes and and consequently they're not so motivated to get involved to make sure things happen the way they'd like to see them happen
sw4784B-ms98-a-0012 85.270250 87.055375 um-hum
sw4784B-ms98-a-0013 87.055375 126.833375 [silence]
sw4784B-ms98-a-0014 126.833375 128.118250 right
sw4784B-ms98-a-0015 128.118250 144.897750 [silence]
sw4784B-ms98-a-0016 144.897750 158.134750 right it troubles me too th[at]- that the priority seems to be with my particular purse strings rather than the public good and [noise] by [laughter-definition] for some of us at least the public good includes
sw4784B-ms98-a-0017 158.134750 171.785875 having an educated populace i mean the idea uh that uh you can make a sound judgment [noise] with respect to [noise] small votes in in the at the local level or bigger votes at the national level uh
sw4784B-ms98-a-0018 171.785875 179.543250 uh it means that you've got to be informed and you've got to have a certain level of education to do the reading and the critical thinking involved to come up with a decision
sw4784B-ms98-a-0019 179.543250 196.841125 [silence]
sw4784B-ms98-a-0020 196.841125 198.155250 right
sw4784B-ms98-a-0021 198.155250 203.472750 [silence]
sw4784B-ms98-a-0022 203.472750 211.812750 right it has taken on a m[ore]- m[ore]- more profound and you'd think we'd notice it economic uh thrust yeah
sw4784B-ms98-a-0023 211.812750 220.274000 [silence]
sw4784B-ms98-a-0024 220.274000 225.169875 [laughter] well i'm glad that you added that one yeah i think that one's significant
sw4784B-ms98-a-0025 225.169875 264.235375 [silence]
sw4784B-ms98-a-0026 264.235375 272.482125 right well i [noise] i agr[ee]- agree with everything that you've said so far and the only thing i'd wanna add is that 
sw4784B-ms98-a-0027 272.482125 284.621000 i'm a little more in contact i think with public school teachers than perhaps you are uh except as a parent of your child and the s[ense]- sense that i get from public school teachers that i know is [noise] that
sw4784B-ms98-a-0028 284.621000 297.858000 they are very conscious of what they feel they should be doing and they are the three things that you mentioned but they find that they are also being asked to do a bunch of other stuff which they think is only tangentially related like consumer e[ducation]-
