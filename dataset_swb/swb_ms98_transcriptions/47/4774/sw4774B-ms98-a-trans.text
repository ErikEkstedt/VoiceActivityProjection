sw4774B-ms98-a-0002 1.015125 2.723750 [silence]
sw4774B-ms98-a-0003 2.723750 5.458625 okay um based
sw4774B-ms98-a-0004 5.458625 9.217125 oh okay good [laughter]
sw4774B-ms98-a-0005 9.217125 17.492375 [silence]
sw4774B-ms98-a-0006 17.492375 18.913125 uh-huh
sw4774B-ms98-a-0007 18.913125 23.965500 [silence]
sw4774B-ms98-a-0008 23.965500 26.747750 right so do i [laughter]
sw4774B-ms98-a-0009 26.747750 34.803500 [silence]
sw4774B-ms98-a-0010 34.803500 36.227625 uh-huh
sw4774B-ms98-a-0011 36.227625 51.246750 [silence]
sw4774B-ms98-a-0012 51.246750 58.681625 right i think if it's got to be done for one person in the company it should be random testing it should be for everybody
sw4774B-ms98-a-0013 58.681625 64.794625 you know when they answer the company i think it'll make it a lot easier and they'd run into less problems
sw4774B-ms98-a-0014 64.794625 74.887875 because uh i don't know i come from the teaching field too and it sort of uh [laughter] it's a pro and a con ty[pe]- i don't know where to stand on it
sw4774B-ms98-a-0015 74.887875 87.749250 i'm more or less if they told me i had to well then fine but if you know if they made me then i'd probably if i had my druthers i'd probably say well no [laughter] you know just this
sw4774B-ms98-a-0016 87.749250 89.746125 right
sw4774B-ms98-a-0017 89.746125 95.395750 [silence]
sw4774B-ms98-a-0018 95.395750 96.823375 uh-huh
sw4774B-ms98-a-0019 96.823375 98.859625 [silence]
sw4774B-ms98-a-0020 98.859625 107.501375 yeah i think it's it's what they're basically trying to do i don't know up here in Massachusetts anyhow what they're basically trying to do is uh [noise]
sw4774B-ms98-a-0021 107.501375 116.502250 oh gosh uh any people who had dr[ug]- tested positively getting them into a drug program or rehab program
sw4774B-ms98-a-0022 116.502250 128.794125 and uh anybody who uh gee is you know di[d]- doesn't accept the rehab program then they're more or less getting laid off
sw4774B-ms98-a-0023 128.794125 130.284750 [silence]
sw4774B-ms98-a-0024 130.284750 139.888000 i- i think that's really hard to because you know you never know i don't know it's it that's a it's really weird issue i'm sort of on the fence about it
sw4774B-ms98-a-0025 139.888000 150.828375 but i you know that that's what's they're coming across as is some of the companies anyhow oh we can get you into a drug program but then you wear that stigma [laughter-you] [laughter-know]
sw4774B-ms98-a-0026 150.828375 159.567875 where uh like a lot of people are saying well i only smoked a joint last night i don't have any problems [laughter-you] [laughter-know] or something like that yeah
sw4774B-ms98-a-0027 159.567875 171.165500 [silence]
sw4774B-ms98-a-0028 171.165500 183.302000 right anything with an a you know if you drink a lot of caffeine or yeah somebody was saying telling me if you drink it in you know an awful lot of caffeine that that can show up as a positive test
sw4774B-ms98-a-0029 183.302000 188.881125 i know i'm an epileptic so i'd probably test positive and [laughter]
sw4774B-ms98-a-0030 188.881125 193.698875 and then i'd have a heck of a time explaining what drug is in my system you know [laughter]
sw4774B-ms98-a-0031 193.698875 203.439750 and a lot of times those are the things i don't like to disclose to an employer because then they don't want to have anything to do with you [laughter] you know it's very personal
sw4774B-ms98-a-0032 203.439750 209.754000 i wouldn't want to have it disclosed because_1 then i'd always wonder if they fired me you know why did you fire me [laughter]
sw4774B-ms98-a-0033 209.754000 214.621625 [silence]
sw4774B-ms98-a-0034 214.621625 215.949250 uh-huh
sw4774B-ms98-a-0035 215.949250 218.141750 [silence]
sw4774B-ms98-a-0036 218.141750 222.956125 yeah it it hits me as the Orwell thing Big brother is [laughter-watching]
sw4774B-ms98-a-0037 222.956125 224.628000 Orwell
sw4774B-ms98-a-0038 224.628000 228.436500 and you know his book Big brother is watching
sw4774B-ms98-a-0039 228.436500 235.708875 you know you're being controlled [laughter] that type of deal and i sh[y]- i don't really you know i don't know
sw4774B-ms98-a-0040 235.708875 245.297625 seems awful strange i'd hate to have to [noise] if i had my choice between a company that did testing and a company who didn't i'd probably take the company who didn't
sw4774B-ms98-a-0041 245.297625 248.294000 because_1 i feel there'd be more trust in the employees
sw4774B-ms98-a-0042 248.294000 253.362375 but i can understand why they need it with all the you know train accidents and everything else
sw4774B-ms98-a-0043 253.362375 256.777000 [silence]
sw4774B-ms98-a-0044 256.777000 258.000000 uh
sw4774B-ms98-a-0045 258.000000 264.164125 i think they will too because uh you know it's just going to follow
sw4774B-ms98-a-0046 264.164125 268.562500 i don't know i we haven't had any of it in our school system
sw4774B-ms98-a-0047 268.562500 274.523500 so uh you know hopefully we won't [laughter]
sw4774B-ms98-a-0048 274.523500 281.989125 [silence]
sw4774B-ms98-a-0049 281.989125 283.430125 right
sw4774B-ms98-a-0050 283.430125 285.142625 [silence]
sw4774B-ms98-a-0051 285.142625 292.028375 well and eventually it's going to be not only the tea[chers]- you know the kids are going to be under scrutiny it's going to be the teachers
sw4774B-ms98-a-0052 292.028375 296.180625 and if they can test the teachers that gives them the full right to test the kids
sw4774B-ms98-a-0053 296.180625 299.554000 and then they've you know caught everybody m[ore]-
