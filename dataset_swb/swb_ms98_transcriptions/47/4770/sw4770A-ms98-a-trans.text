sw4770A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 8.600750 [noise] uh i don't know my personal perception of government and uh the way things are at this current time is that nobody can really be trusted
sw4770A-ms98-a-0002 8.600750 20.750750 and i don't feel that too many of the candidates are out there to uh be self-serving to the community i think that they have their own uh wishes to uh be in the limelight
sw4770A-ms98-a-0003 20.750750 33.366875 and to kind of say hey you know i'm a public official i don't have to do uh certain things and they just stand out more involving themselves more and more with politics but
sw4770A-ms98-a-0004 33.366875 45.845625 uh it's really after all the things that i've seen in the last ten years about government and now the overdrafts uh of checks uh before that it was the wonderful uh
sw4770A-ms98-a-0005 45.845625 59.429750 escapade that they had with uh the new uh oh God chief of uh well Supreme Court i'm trying to think of his name and uh what they put uh him through in regards to yeah Thomas
sw4770A-ms98-a-0006 59.429750 72.152625 the sex the sexual harassment that kind of thing and just to see our government react to that and then just little things that have added up where people have taken vacations on taxpayers' monies and things like that
sw4770A-ms98-a-0007 72.152625 81.776375 i- i just think it's very corrupt and whether or not they need to start with people that are extremely poor and send them into government versus people that are rich 
sw4770A-ms98-a-0008 81.776375 90.359375 but it's always the rich person that gets into government that has uh the money to advertise the money to d[o]- to do this there's no more Abe
sw4770A-ms98-a-0009 90.359375 97.236125 Abraham Lincolns out there uh that can get into government even if they were poor
sw4770A-ms98-a-0010 97.236125 101.644375 so i know that's my personal viewpoint of things
sw4770A-ms98-a-0011 101.644375 105.150750 [silence]
sw4770A-ms98-a-0012 105.150750 112.155625 now they just uh they've already put through the health bill [noise] yes it just went through and it was passed
sw4770A-ms98-a-0013 112.155625 122.816125 and that is going to be a heavier tax burden on a lot of the taxpay[ers]- taxpayers and a little bit more on to the medical uh
sw4770A-ms98-a-0014 122.816125 132.384625 i don't know if that was done out of just let's be the first state to do it or if it was done really for the needs of the people you know what i'm saying it it's
sw4770A-ms98-a-0015 132.384625 139.754625 right now every little state around here is thinking about oh we need to reform the health uh system
sw4770A-ms98-a-0016 139.754625 147.150375 and of course they think uh Wisconsin our neigh[bor]- or Minnesota our neighbor passed a state law the health bill
sw4770A-ms98-a-0017 147.150375 161.360750 and it's kind of like we're the first to do it so i don't know if it's done because we're we want to be standing out as being innovative in the health system or whether it was done for uh
sw4770A-ms98-a-0018 161.360750 169.085875 you know a real good purpose to help people that can't afford uh health insurance that kind of thing
sw4770A-ms98-a-0019 169.085875 176.390375 [silence]

sw4770A-ms98-a-0027 199.059500 212.184500 uh you can't expect uh when we have TVs and we have things that are kind of bombarded at us for uh you know immorality and this and this and this that we can expect somebody to come off that's going to be clean
sw4770A-ms98-a-0028 212.184500 216.578625 totally clean [laughter] and come into government uh
sw4770A-ms98-a-0029 216.578625 224.146750 but down the line it does hurt i mean when somebody's corrupt and somebody's doing something it's uh you know it does hurt
sw4770A-ms98-a-0030 224.146750 235.411000 the each individual of the society when you find out that somebody's done something or the overdraft policy or you know the other things that have occurred so uh
