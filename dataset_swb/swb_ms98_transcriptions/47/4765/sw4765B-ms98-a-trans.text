sw4765B-ms98-a-0007 32.458625 34.785375 [laughter]
sw4765B-ms98-a-0008 34.785375 50.077125 [silence]
sw4765B-ms98-a-0009 50.077125 52.112875 sure sure
sw4765B-ms98-a-0010 52.112875 58.128875 [silence]
sw4765B-ms98-a-0011 58.128875 59.896500 hm
sw4765B-ms98-a-0012 59.896500 68.445000 [silence]
sw4765B-ms98-a-0013 68.445000 70.535875 uh-huh
sw4765B-ms98-a-0014 70.535875 86.282750 [silence]
sw4765B-ms98-a-0015 86.282750 88.706750 yeah
sw4765B-ms98-a-0016 88.706750 94.915750 um well i guess i i guess i'm probably a little more t[oward]- toward the other direction um
sw4765B-ms98-a-0017 94.915750 98.328250 well i guess mainly because um
sw4765B-ms98-a-0018 98.328250 107.381500 it's i well like there's two sides to it i guess um one is that um if you're coming to work under the influence of any sort of drug alcohol whatever 
sw4765B-ms98-a-0019 107.381500 111.666625 or you know even if it's smoking inhibits you know your ability to function then
sw4765B-ms98-a-0020 111.666625 117.037000 i- i think that that you know i don't have any problem at all with testing that individual you know on the spot
sw4765B-ms98-a-0021 117.037000 122.622500 um but i guess i feel more like whatever you're doing in your own private life is your own private business
sw4765B-ms98-a-0022 122.622500 130.543500 um and i guess part of the reason there is because of the fact that uh things like drug laws seem to come and go
sw4765B-ms98-a-0023 130.543500 133.640625 you know we had prohibition for awhile and then we didn't have prohibition
sw4765B-ms98-a-0024 133.640625 137.995875 um [noise] you know we've had i guess laws against uh
sw4765B-ms98-a-0025 137.995875 143.523000 you know various other forms of drugs for the last what sixty or seventy years i guess maybe a little longer
sw4765B-ms98-a-0026 143.523000 150.600625 [silence]
sw4765B-ms98-a-0027 150.600625 153.800625 yeah w[ell]- so eighty eighty eighty years or so yeah
sw4765B-ms98-a-0028 153.800625 162.891875 um so i you know it's it's hard to i guess for me to justify what s[eems]- seems like you know basically a breach of the First Amen[dment]- you know
sw4765B-ms98-a-0029 162.891875 172.263250 freedom from uh search and seizure y[ou]- you know um on something that may or may not stand as a law you know fifty years from now or even twenty or ten who knows
sw4765B-ms98-a-0030 172.263250 174.800375 i mean prohibition certainly didn't last
sw4765B-ms98-a-0031 174.800375 184.993375 [silence]
sw4765B-ms98-a-0032 184.993375 189.888500 well but you got to look at prohibition though you had the same problems there right
sw4765B-ms98-a-0033 189.888500 195.335750 [silence]
sw4765B-ms98-a-0034 195.335750 208.278000 oh yeah sure well it goes back to the again if you look at prohibition i mean because it's illegal it costs more if it was legal i mean face it you can buy pharmaceutical grade cocaine for what ten or twenty dollars an ounce
sw4765B-ms98-a-0035 208.278000 217.469000 and clearly if you're into Coke and all you wanna do is you know snort your brains out all day long if it was legal you could do it real cheap and you know you'd be a menace to nobody but yourself as long as you stayed at home and did it
sw4765B-ms98-a-0036 217.469000 220.252250 but yeah get um
sw4765B-ms98-a-0037 220.252250 225.877500 [silence]
sw4765B-ms98-a-0038 225.877500 232.670125 oh yeah well that's why there's you know why there's people dealing it because there's money in it you know there's a ridiculous amounts of money in it 
sw4765B-ms98-a-0039 232.670125 240.431250 [silence]
sw4765B-ms98-a-0040 240.431250 243.242750 [laughter]
sw4765B-ms98-a-0041 243.242750 248.958125 [silence]
sw4765B-ms98-a-0042 248.958125 250.989625 oh yeah interdiction's hopeless
sw4765B-ms98-a-0043 250.989625 253.803125 i mean there's no way you're ever gonna win that
sw4765B-ms98-a-0044 253.803125 258.471250 the tighter you squeeze the more the price goes up so the more incentive there is i mean that's a losing fight
sw4765B-ms98-a-0045 258.471250 264.597750 [silence]
sw4765B-ms98-a-0046 264.597750 267.673625 yeah yeah
sw4765B-ms98-a-0047 267.673625 276.446375 well yeah it goes back to you know what right what can society impose on people i mean can you force somebody to be a good productive citizen i don't think you can i mean
sw4765B-ms98-a-0048 276.446375 285.346125 you know i'm you know was raised with the very strong Bible work ethic so you know i'm one of these you know ten twelve fifteen twenty hour a day type people
sw4765B-ms98-a-0049 285.346125 296.583500 so you know yeah i- i can really relate to yeah everybody ought to do their own share you know i don't have any you know love lost for people who are on the public dole just because they're too lazy to get a job or or that kind of stuff
sw4765B-ms98-a-0050 296.583500 298.306000 but you know
