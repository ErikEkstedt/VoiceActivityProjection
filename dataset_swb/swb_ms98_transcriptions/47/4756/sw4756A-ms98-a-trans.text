sw4756A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 11.545875 [noise] think is wrong with the public school system is that i think we've lately in the last twenty years or so kind of lost focus with the basics
sw4756A-ms98-a-0002 11.545875 18.997500 uh in order to go into this sort of specialized curriculum where uh we're teaching kids
sw4756A-ms98-a-0003 18.997500 29.554125 not a broad base of subjects but rather trying to concentrate them on particular subject areas that they think they might be interested in going into a career
sw4756A-ms98-a-0004 29.554125 42.680000 uh about and the problem comes about if these people aren't well rounded students or graduates that that sort of traps them in the field that they've spent all this time being educated in
sw4756A-ms98-a-0005 42.680000 66.444750 [silence]
sw4756A-ms98-a-0006 66.444750 67.807250 uh-huh
sw4756A-ms98-a-0007 67.807250 80.573625 [silence]
sw4756A-ms98-a-0008 80.573625 89.107125 yeah that's it's i'm only twenty four years old so i've was through a lot of that uh although
sw4756A-ms98-a-0009 89.107125 97.619000 [laughter] well in my luckily up here the school system up here was intelligent enough that they didn't want to get that focused
sw4756A-ms98-a-0010 97.619000 110.712875 and they drilled into our heads and the same thing with the college that i went to to get as broad of an education as possible so that you're down with the basics and then once you know what you want to do then
sw4756A-ms98-a-0011 110.712875 121.664250 try and uh get some specific courses but i remember one of the things that they were always drilling into us was the need to learn how to communicate effectively through writing
sw4756A-ms98-a-0012 121.664250 132.904125 and i- i constantly come up against some of the writings being involved in uh computers and the like where i see other people writing and it's embarrassing [laughter]
sw4756A-ms98-a-0013 132.904125 146.864625 you know it's some of these things that and i've seen papers that in sixth grade i wouldn't have had returned uh to me which are getting A's in college today the standards have really fallen

sw4756A-ms98-a-0018 162.729875 163.981375 huh
sw4756A-ms98-a-0019 163.981375 171.684375 yeah it it [vocalized-noise] the only way that i ever you know i- i took Comp journalism as a major and uh
sw4756A-ms98-a-0020 171.684375 179.282875 the writing they what they would do is they would focus in on our particular problems w[ell]- on the college level course and uh
sw4756A-ms98-a-0021 179.282875 187.695125 uh would then work with us as far as fixing those things i had a problem with uh writing excessive verbiage
sw4756A-ms98-a-0022 187.695125 195.601875 uh in my writing and i they taught me basically how to pair it down a little bit and i- i don't see that in a broader
sw4756A-ms98-a-0023 195.601875 208.776375 you know even in a public school uh situation because a lot of the teachers have these large classes that they can't devote the individual attention to each student that they may have twenty or thirty years ago
sw4756A-ms98-a-0024 208.776375 213.952375 [silence]
sw4756A-ms98-a-0025 213.952375 222.413375 i remember large group in certain uh courses mainly Political Science we'd have lectures where there'd be three hundred students
sw4756A-ms98-a-0026 222.413375 230.273125 and if you had a question you know or or didn't understand it at all of course you're not going to raise your hand in a [laughter-three] [laughter-hundred] group
sw4756A-ms98-a-0027 230.273125 235.874375 [laughter] thing and say i don't know what you're talking about they're going to just keep their mouth shut [laughter]
sw4756A-ms98-a-0028 235.874375 239.449625 and i think you know it's those kinds of things that
sw4756A-ms98-a-0029 239.449625 246.778125 i i'm not sure how we go about fixing something like that other than maybe devoting some more uh
sw4756A-ms98-a-0030 246.778125 257.772250 uh resources into first of all getting uh the uh teachers reasonable salaries and uh expecting in return some sort of standard
sw4756A-ms98-a-0031 257.772250 264.396000 s[tandard]- and uh you know some proof that what they're doing is actually worth what we want to pay them
sw4756A-ms98-a-0032 264.396000 268.175625 and then try and get maybe more involvement with the parents
sw4756A-ms98-a-0033 268.175625 275.871125 [noise] a lot of parents expect the schools to just take care of their kids and uh you know you y[ou]- it's your job not mine
