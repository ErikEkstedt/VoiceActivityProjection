sw4756B-ms98-a-0006 66.496750 70.806250 and uh the courses were too specialized as you said
sw4756B-ms98-a-0007 70.806250 80.919625 and you just read you know they they take a whole semester long course on uh on one writer or something uh that's fine for college but it seems kind of silly for high school [noise]
