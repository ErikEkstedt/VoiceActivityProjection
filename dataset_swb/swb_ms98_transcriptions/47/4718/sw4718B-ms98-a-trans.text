sw4718B-ms98-a-0022 74.570875 81.162750 i kind of would like the idea of having a 401K or something that i could you know contribute to and get some matching contributions

sw4718B-ms98-a-0051 163.874750 166.486500 huh what what did she work for
sw4718B-ms98-a-0052 166.486500 171.092625 [silence]
sw4718B-ms98-a-0053 171.092625 172.406125 uh-huh
sw4718B-ms98-a-0054 172.406125 177.023125 [silence]
sw4718B-ms98-a-0055 177.023125 178.302250 oh really
sw4718B-ms98-a-0056 178.302250 180.898125 yeah that sounds pretty familiar to me
sw4718B-ms98-a-0057 180.898125 182.596500 but uh
sw4718B-ms98-a-0058 182.596500 184.021375 [silence]
sw4718B-ms98-a-0059 184.021375 185.364750 um-hum
sw4718B-ms98-a-0060 185.364750 186.788250 [silence]
sw4718B-ms98-a-0061 186.788250 188.064000 yeah
sw4718B-ms98-a-0062 188.064000 190.691125 well uh [noise] do you get to
sw4718B-ms98-a-0063 190.691125 197.033750 i don't know have you heard of any people that kind of do this uh the cafeteria plan where they kind of let you choose what kind of benefits you get or
sw4718B-ms98-a-0064 197.033750 202.636500 is that something that Florida does or where your work the state of Florida or you pretty much get what they give you and
sw4718B-ms98-a-0065 202.636500 213.736000 [silence]
sw4718B-ms98-a-0066 213.736000 223.466750 yeah i guess a lot of the more uh some of the newer companies and the up and coming real fast growing ones kind of do that way but some people say it ends up costing them_1 more because whatever
sw4718B-ms98-a-0067 223.466750 229.757125 you know men and women alike they give them_1 say three hundred bucks a month and they can buy their health insurance and their retirement and whatever but
sw4718B-ms98-a-0068 229.757125 232.582250 and if th[ey]- whatever they don't use they get in cash
sw4718B-ms98-a-0069 232.582250 240.218625 but a lot of companies don't like to do that because they figure if you got two people working then one spouse might take insurance and the other won't so it saves the company money
sw4718B-ms98-a-0070 240.218625 243.103125 whereas this one you know you'd end up paying regardless
sw4718B-ms98-a-0071 243.103125 246.903250 but for the employees it sure sounded like a pretty good idea
sw4718B-ms98-a-0072 246.903250 249.717500 but anyway i haven't uh
sw4718B-ms98-a-0073 249.717500 253.136125 haven't got so fortunate as to get into any of those companies yet
sw4718B-ms98-a-0074 253.136125 254.723375 but
sw4718B-ms98-a-0075 254.723375 256.989500 anyway
sw4718B-ms98-a-0076 256.989500 259.698000 well hey it was good talking to you
sw4718B-ms98-a-0077 259.698000 262.165250 all right see you later bye-bye
sw4718B-ms98-a-0078 262.165250 263.810000 [noise]
