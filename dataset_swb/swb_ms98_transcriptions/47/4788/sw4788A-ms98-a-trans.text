sw4788A-ms98-a-0002 0.649000 11.556750 i don't know your camping experiences probably i don't know if they're similar to mine but uh since i've had children it has changed a little bit but uh when my husband and i were uh camping we'd take the
sw4788A-ms98-a-0003 11.556750 18.310500 domed tent that uh is easily collapsible and uh go camping and uh
sw4788A-ms98-a-0004 18.310500 30.991875 just kind of roughed it as long as there was a bathroom there and some clean showers and things like that then it was fine but uh we'd get up at three in the morning and start on our little uh escapade for the day and uh
sw4788A-ms98-a-0005 30.991875 43.353500 kind of uh do a lot of different things and then stop when we wanted to but uh that's kind of changed now when you have uh a small child because they don't wanna get up at [laughter-three] [laughter-in] [laughter-the] [laughter-morning] and you don't want them up that early
sw4788A-ms98-a-0006 43.353500 47.233125 [silence]
sw4788A-ms98-a-0007 47.233125 59.422375 oh yeah yeah we did a lot of different things we'd stop when we wanted to that kind of stuff so a we kind of did a little bit of hiking sure and a little bit of uh sightseeing uh i[n]- different areas uh
sw4788A-ms98-a-0008 59.422375 69.914875 sitting back at uh different areas and spending hours we never had really a time limit we just kind of did what we wanted to do for that day very comfortable so
sw4788A-ms98-a-0009 69.914875 72.706750 [silence]
sw4788A-ms98-a-0010 72.706750 80.753375 well there's uh places in Wisconsin there's the Apostle Islands um which are in Bayfield which is a wonderful place
sw4788A-ms98-a-0011 80.753375 87.667000 and then there's also uh what we found uh in the state of uh South Dakota the Black Hills
sw4788A-ms98-a-0012 87.667000 102.334000 and we just have this uh really good time there one thing is they don't have mosquitoes and uh sorry to say and uh [laughter] [laughter-in] Wisconsin we do so that kind of puts a little bit of a hamper on your uh 
sw4788A-ms98-a-0013 102.334000 108.368750 you know if you if you're gonna go camping who wants to deal with bugs and uh [laughter]

sw4788A-ms98-a-0039 186.100875 193.795625 [silence]
sw4788A-ms98-a-0040 193.795625 203.320125 than you sure than it when you were younger uh-huh i[t]- it it's with kids we don't care if they take a shower everyday with kids we don't care you know uh
sw4788A-ms98-a-0041 203.320125 212.749875 a lo[t]- about a lot of things but as adults uh it's like if i don't take a shower every day i feel like you know ooh i- i- i just don't feel right so
sw4788A-ms98-a-0042 212.749875 219.697500 uh there's lots of places if you're gonna go camping KOA's are wonderful it's kind [laughter-of] it's kind of the uh 
sw4788A-ms98-a-0043 219.697500 234.539500 yuppie type of camping because they have showers they have things for kids to do they have swimming pools things like that and you can find uh some really nice clean uh campgrounds versus um if you go to a state parks
sw4788A-ms98-a-0044 234.539500 241.112000 um we have found state parks not that they're lacking but uh they're certainly not
sw4788A-ms98-a-0045 241.112000 252.784250 up to a standard of a KOA where it's you know a little bit cleaner you've got the showers available it's not you know in the same category state parks
sw4788A-ms98-a-0046 252.784250 263.659375 you know you get a little bit fearful too uh you know things like that simply because it's they are supposed to be patrolled but uh you know it's it's a little bit different but
sw4788A-ms98-a-0047 263.659375 273.993000 so we've always kind of stayed with a KOA and then uh did other things besides just sit at the campground at night that's the only time that you really use your campground 
sw4788A-ms98-a-0048 273.993000 281.022625 if you're gonna be gone all day long walking someplace or uh doing tourism or whatever uh
sw4788A-ms98-a-0049 281.022625 290.378625 you're camping really is just for like in the evening to start the fire to sit back and watch a fire uh to enjoy that you know and then
sw4788A-ms98-a-0050 290.378625 299.074000 to get up in the morning and get a shower and get cleaned up that kind of stuff so we never really spent that much time at the campground as much as we did
