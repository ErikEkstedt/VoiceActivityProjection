sw4761A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.835125 [noise]
sw4761A-ms98-a-0002 0.835125 5.240500 why don't you go ahead with the fishing part [laughter]
sw4761A-ms98-a-0003 5.240500 9.933875 [silence]
sw4761A-ms98-a-0004 9.933875 11.299125 okay
sw4761A-ms98-a-0005 11.299125 15.392125 [silence]
sw4761A-ms98-a-0006 15.392125 16.677250 um-hum
sw4761A-ms98-a-0007 16.677250 17.680125 [silence]
sw4761A-ms98-a-0008 17.680125 18.733250 sure
sw4761A-ms98-a-0009 18.733250 25.499000 [silence]
sw4761A-ms98-a-0010 25.499000 28.414375 sure for the different areas yeah
sw4761A-ms98-a-0011 28.414375 33.216875 yeah and basically big lake small lake it doesn't matter to me
sw4761A-ms98-a-0012 33.216875 43.654625 um preference wise to fish for the best if you're going to eat what you are going to catch is pan fish um i've caught you know are northern and
sw4761A-ms98-a-0013 43.654625 45.058125 and pipes and
sw4761A-ms98-a-0014 45.058125 52.157500 uh northern pipes and other walleyes and things like that and preferably to me the meat isn't that great
sw4761A-ms98-a-0015 52.157500 56.542750 i'd rather have the blue gills the sunnies the crappies the perch
sw4761A-ms98-a-0016 56.542750 63.324625 um to me they're better tasting so i always seem to go fishing for the smaller um
sw4761A-ms98-a-0017 63.324625 65.928250 smaller fish versus the big fish
sw4761A-ms98-a-0018 65.928250 71.313875 but um when i was growing up my father kind of introduced me to fly fishing
sw4761A-ms98-a-0019 71.313875 81.478375 and that was kind of a very interesting uh experience that i had and i'm sure that part of me would like to go back and do that it's kind of like for trout fishing
sw4761A-ms98-a-0020 81.478375 86.291000 and i'm sure someday i'll probably get back but uh at the current time
sw4761A-ms98-a-0021 86.291000 87.339250 the most
sw4761A-ms98-a-0022 87.339250 98.334250 if i go fishing it's basically with the worm at the end of the hook and i you know try to catch the small fish it's it's not for the big try to try to get the biggie so
sw4761A-ms98-a-0023 98.334250 102.088625 [silence]
sw4761A-ms98-a-0024 102.088625 103.407000 um-hum
sw4761A-ms98-a-0025 103.407000 105.764125 [silence]
sw4761A-ms98-a-0026 105.764125 106.846375 sure
sw4761A-ms98-a-0027 106.846375 111.264000 it's kind of fun i- i mean it's a continual movement and versus uh
sw4761A-ms98-a-0028 111.264000 121.414750 uh when you put that uh worm at the end of the hook you sit there and you wait and you wait and then you may move it a little bit just to say that hey you know there's something there but uh
sw4761A-ms98-a-0029 121.414750 130.735000 uh with fly fishing you're constantly uh moving that uh you know your line and you're continually keeping it up and keeping it back down so
sw4761A-ms98-a-0030 130.735000 132.571375 [silence]
sw4761A-ms98-a-0031 132.571375 135.195625 exactly exactly
sw4761A-ms98-a-0032 135.195625 139.883750 it takes a lot of patience and a lot of time to learn how to do it so
sw4761A-ms98-a-0033 139.883750 149.811500 um but uh with my family uh [vocalized-noise] when we do got fishing uh my my daughter's real small and she has not experienced fishing yet so i'd rather
sw4761A-ms98-a-0034 149.811500 156.717625 you know get her into fishing with the worm at the end of the hook and hopefully catch some uh fish so
sw4761A-ms98-a-0035 156.717625 159.587000 [silence]
sw4761A-ms98-a-0036 159.587000 161.870500 oh gosh yeah
sw4761A-ms98-a-0037 161.870500 164.172875 [silence]
sw4761A-ms98-a-0038 164.172875 166.855125 oh what an experience huh
sw4761A-ms98-a-0039 166.855125 167.870250 [silence]
sw4761A-ms98-a-0040 167.870250 172.561375 now that i wouldn't probably i i'm sure that they probably were very delicious tasty
sw4761A-ms98-a-0041 172.561375 176.895375 [silence]
sw4761A-ms98-a-0042 176.895375 178.819750 um-hum um-hum
sw4761A-ms98-a-0043 178.819750 179.831750 [silence]
sw4761A-ms98-a-0044 179.831750 181.740625 yeah yeah
sw4761A-ms98-a-0045 181.740625 183.453750 and it seems like
sw4761A-ms98-a-0046 183.453750 188.125125 [silence]
sw4761A-ms98-a-0047 188.125125 190.251625 sure in the [vocalized-noise] in the salmon
sw4761A-ms98-a-0048 190.251625 191.244500 um-hum
sw4761A-ms98-a-0049 191.244500 200.702500 well i've also noticed i don't know the best time of the year for fishing uh in this area is right after the winter and the ice is been on and it's real cold water
sw4761A-ms98-a-0050 200.702500 208.211500 but it seems like if you go fishing like in the middle of the summer when it's hot and humid uh the fish tastes [vocalized-noise] tastes fishy
sw4761A-ms98-a-0051 208.211500 214.661500 versus um when the water it's just opened up from the ice and the water temperature is extremely cold 
sw4761A-ms98-a-0052 214.661500 220.474375 it's almost the better tasting fish are either ice fishing uh when you go ice fishing or
sw4761A-ms98-a-0053 220.474375 235.102375 when uh you know you go right towards the early spring part uh before summer hits because after summer whether the ponds here aren't that deep or the water just changes and it gets busier and more people are out on the lakes
sw4761A-ms98-a-0054 235.102375 239.418625 and less maybe water like in the spring we have lots of rain coming in
sw4761A-ms98-a-0055 239.418625 243.154000 um there's a big difference in you know fishing too
sw4761A-ms98-a-0056 243.154000 249.831375 which brings up another point point too as far as ice fishing that's uh way up here in the north here [laughter]
sw4761A-ms98-a-0057 249.831375 259.508750 that's uh that's a big thing too and i haven't done that in a long time but that's enjoyable if you have the right setting and you have a little house to sit in there and uh
sw4761A-ms98-a-0058 259.508750 267.825750 a little heater then it's then it's it's good but uh if you have to sit out there in the blowing winds it's not so great on a lake
sw4761A-ms98-a-0059 267.825750 268.895375 [silence]
sw4761A-ms98-a-0060 268.895375 272.374375 but anyway it was really good talking to you and uh
sw4761A-ms98-a-0061 272.374375 274.199875 have fun fishing
sw4761A-ms98-a-0062 274.199875 278.383125 [silence]
sw4761A-ms98-a-0063 278.383125 283.098750 you know this is kind of funny um i've had nothing but male callers
sw4761A-ms98-a-0064 283.098750 289.280875 um every time that i've placed a call it's been with a male and i'm not quite sure if they're taking uh
sw4761A-ms98-a-0065 289.280875 298.018000 i think what they're trying to do is get a lot of men and some women together [vocalized-noise] i was chosen the first time i went through in
