sw4733A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.795000 think about this
sw4733A-ms98-a-0002 1.795000 3.639625 i do
sw4733A-ms98-a-0003 3.639625 8.419625 [silence]
sw4733A-ms98-a-0004 8.419625 10.056750 oh
sw4733A-ms98-a-0005 10.056750 15.270875 so you see a big difference then in before and now do you or
sw4733A-ms98-a-0006 15.270875 17.594875 [silence]
sw4733A-ms98-a-0007 17.594875 19.585875 a lot of testing
sw4733A-ms98-a-0008 19.585875 24.075250 [silence]
sw4733A-ms98-a-0009 24.075250 25.517000 uh-huh
sw4733A-ms98-a-0010 25.517000 28.158500 [silence]
sw4733A-ms98-a-0011 28.158500 29.800125 um-hum
sw4733A-ms98-a-0012 29.800125 33.738875 i do too i oh i think that's awful
sw4733A-ms98-a-0013 33.738875 43.488750 [silence]
sw4733A-ms98-a-0014 43.488750 47.390625 i know really what's the new criteria huh
sw4733A-ms98-a-0015 47.390625 49.592625 [silence]
sw4733A-ms98-a-0016 49.592625 60.560250 [noise] we have all kinds of testing and it's over and over it's ITBS or and uh just everything everything and they test test test i live in Plano actually and
sw4733A-ms98-a-0017 60.560250 67.526750 i don't know if you've heard of Plano but it's a very transient community a lot of people from everywhere it's just north of Dallas
sw4733A-ms98-a-0018 67.526750 76.134625 and it's grown in leaps and bounds i we must have maybe a hundred and fifty thousand people now and most of them from other places
sw4733A-ms98-a-0019 76.134625 88.916375 uh JC Penney's come down from New York and of course TI and Xerox from Rochester and we just have lots of people from everywhere lots of industry coming in and it's a very wealthy community
sw4733A-ms98-a-0020 88.916375 101.243250 uh not that i am but other people seem to be and i would love to know why but i mean they do they have i i would i really would i mean they just have beautiful beautiful homes and they have everything
sw4733A-ms98-a-0021 101.243250 114.915625 the kids only wear name brand things to school and it's one of these things well it does you know it really does because_1 i'm a single mom and i have a thirteen year old now and uh you know it does i mean we do it to a point but um
sw4733A-ms98-a-0022 114.915625 118.938000 not to where she feels different but some of them are very rich and so
sw4733A-ms98-a-0023 118.938000 126.455750 um we just kind of have everything here and we have a very goal oriented population because their parents are
sw4733A-ms98-a-0024 126.455750 135.083000 and so i don't know how much of it is us and how much of it is Texas but the kids are expected to excel in everything
sw4733A-ms98-a-0025 135.083000 139.134250 and it's almost impossible because you have so many children
sw4733A-ms98-a-0026 139.134250 146.561375 and just so many activities that everybody can't be first and they're expected to be you know their parents expect it
sw4733A-ms98-a-0027 146.561375 154.704125 the teachers expect it Texas wants very badly to be considered tops in the school system and if you read national surveys they're far from it
sw4733A-ms98-a-0028 154.704125 160.829500 and so there's just a whole lot of testing and a whole lot of pushing to do well on these tests and
sw4733A-ms98-a-0029 160.829500 174.051125 well not very well they bring home notes that say they have to get a good night's sleep and eat right in the morning before tests i mean they make a big deal to me the paper should just be put on the desk that day and say just do this
sw4733A-ms98-a-0030 174.051125 183.606250 you know i just feel they do better that way and yeah and and i have older children too that now are out of high school and
sw4733A-ms98-a-0031 183.606250 190.852000 uh they've always done this you know i mean it's always been the same but it is it's getting worse and worse there's more pressure for everything
sw4733A-ms98-a-0032 190.852000 197.572500 and i just think it's really awful and i i'm with you on that you don't hear too many people say this but i think it's a very long day
sw4733A-ms98-a-0033 197.572500 204.278000 and my feeling is that you you know you're only a kid once and you don't wanna spend your whole life in school 
sw4733A-ms98-a-0034 204.278000 207.197125 [silence]
sw4733A-ms98-a-0035 207.197125 209.322375 um-hum um-hum
sw4733A-ms98-a-0036 209.322375 216.084250 and i don't think that's right i think we should do what Europe does and include cultural activities in our school system
sw4733A-ms98-a-0037 216.084250 228.699125 i don't [noise] think i should have to pay for dancing lessons gymnastics piano i would like to see those things included in our school system because i think we should have well rounded kids
sw4733A-ms98-a-0038 228.699125 231.300250 not just sm[art]- book smart kids
sw4733A-ms98-a-0039 231.300250 238.074000 and so i just find this a real problem i think if they're gonna be there all day they should find time
sw4733A-ms98-a-0040 238.074000 243.330250 one of my daughters once was out of school with Mono in her junior year i think it was
sw4733A-ms98-a-0041 243.330250 249.293875 and she had a home teacher for like four hours a week and when she went back in six weeks she was ahead
sw4733A-ms98-a-0042 249.293875 254.859250 so what does that tell you the it tells you there's a whole lot of wasted time
sw4733A-ms98-a-0043 254.859250 257.861250 and they could be using this time better
sw4733A-ms98-a-0044 257.861250 268.692125 [silence]
sw4733A-ms98-a-0045 268.692125 270.148000 uh-huh
sw4733A-ms98-a-0046 270.148000 273.559625 [silence]
sw4733A-ms98-a-0047 273.559625 281.173625 that's a very long day for kindergarten but i think that working parents have kind of demanded this 
sw4733A-ms98-a-0048 281.173625 285.848000 you know because they don't they don't wanna send them to day care
sw4733A-ms98-a-0049 285.848000 291.398750 that's why they want them there because then somebody takes care of them all day [noise] so the
sw4733A-ms98-a-0050 291.398750 294.677625 [silence]
sw4733A-ms98-a-0051 294.677625 298.530000 we have them at s[ome]- one school like
