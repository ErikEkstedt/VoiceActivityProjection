sw4710A-ms98-a-0006 13.367125 18.970000 do you have um has Texas always had capital punishment or they ever had a period where they outlawed it
sw4710A-ms98-a-0007 18.970000 21.241750 [silence]
sw4710A-ms98-a-0008 21.241750 23.406500 i see right from day one
sw4710A-ms98-a-0009 23.406500 30.736250 i'd have to confess to you that uh i don't know what the i honestly don't know what the law in Maryland is i think
sw4710A-ms98-a-0010 30.736250 33.547250 we have
sw4710A-ms98-a-0011 33.547250 38.718500 i think we have a capital murder law uh
sw4710A-ms98-a-0012 38.718500 44.026625 i think that's probably the only crime for which you know capital punishment is meted out
sw4710A-ms98-a-0013 44.026625 55.087875 my own i guess my own personal feelings are [vocalized-noise] i tend to take a look at the social cost benefit ratio which sounds kind of callous but uh
sw4710A-ms98-a-0014 55.087875 65.419125 it's basically you know it wha[t]- what is the net the net benefit to society if you execute someone for a particular crime versus say if you lock them up for the rest of their lives or something of that sort
sw4710A-ms98-a-0015 65.419125 71.513250 and in many cases i decide in favor of capital punishment in fact i think in most cases [laughter]
sw4710A-ms98-a-0016 71.513250 77.290750 uh and there probably be a few instances in which i would think that maybe it wasn't warranted

sw4710A-ms98-a-0019 80.796625 83.761250 that's that's death right
sw4710A-ms98-a-0020 83.761250 90.039875 and uh let's see Texas uses death by lethal injection now right

sw4710A-ms98-a-0036 136.330875 139.685250 well Maryland's a pretty complicated state [laughter]
sw4710A-ms98-a-0037 139.685250 141.511750 because_1 it's uh
sw4710A-ms98-a-0038 141.511750 154.180875 well because of its colonial you know background and then of course during the Civil Wa[r]- or during prior and during the Civil War it was a border state you know with half the state northern and half the state southern you know in sentiment and so forth 
sw4710A-ms98-a-0039 154.180875 162.637000 i suspect that like most most states uh you know in the nineteenth century and so forth that they certainly had capital punishment
sw4710A-ms98-a-0040 162.637000 167.394875 uh it's not a Quaker state or something of that sort you know like you know Pennsylvania 
sw4710A-ms98-a-0041 167.394875 169.320750 but uh
sw4710A-ms98-a-0042 169.320750 181.257875 and i as i said i think we we have a a capital murder law on the books right now i guess my feeling you know i can set up some hypothetical cases where uh
sw4710A-ms98-a-0043 181.257875 188.171750 well suppose there was so[mething]- uh you know a famous uh medical researcher who murdered his wife
sw4710A-ms98-a-0044 188.171750 198.968250 you know now this you know the question is well what are the prospects of this medical researcher making medical break throughs that might benefit human beings in the future never mind that he murdered his wife
sw4710A-ms98-a-0045 198.968250 207.086625 [silence]
sw4710A-ms98-a-0046 207.086625 214.892875 right you know and i- i- i think i'd have to sit down and say well what kind of contribution would they make and also what what
sw4710A-ms98-a-0047 214.892875 225.639250 do you i think another element in it in it is what kind of society do you what what message are you trying to send to society i mean like the uh
sw4710A-ms98-a-0048 225.639250 236.698500 i'm i'm actually in favor of things like uh if you're going to execute somebody you uh i don't see any reason why they shouldn't televise it you know or what have you it's uh
sw4710A-ms98-a-0049 236.698500 246.596750 it uh uh you know people ought to be aware of what it is that you know what it is that they're doing and uh you know what what the sentence really means
sw4710A-ms98-a-0050 246.596750 253.144750 when you uh you know if you sentence somebody to death this is what it really means just like they show you what prisons are supposedly like
sw4710A-ms98-a-0051 253.144750 256.333875 um they pardon
