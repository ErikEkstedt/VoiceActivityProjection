sw4710B-ms98-a-0040 258.418625 263.878000 and the Christian view is to forgive you know and uh
sw4710B-ms98-a-0041 263.878000 267.166250 and maybe try to re[habilitation]- rehabilitate
sw4710B-ms98-a-0042 267.166250 278.215750 and of course when you do that you know then your costs go up on that measure and those who have lost someone uh you know feel like tha[t]- that uh the guy's escaped justice
sw4710B-ms98-a-0043 278.215750 289.194000 and uh so you know i can see that point too i'm just kind of the old line that uh i believe if you go out and kill your neighbor you know you can look to lose your own life
sw4710B-ms98-a-0044 289.194000 298.562000 an[d]- and it's true that uh some people uh you know uh go out and and commit a murder and they could really uh
