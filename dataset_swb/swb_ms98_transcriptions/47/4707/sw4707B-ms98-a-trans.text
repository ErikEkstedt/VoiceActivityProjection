sw4707B-ms98-a-0013 81.282625 85.903500 i hate the eight and a half percent sales tax but then on the other hand i don't mind that it's only on
sw4707B-ms98-a-0014 85.903500 87.988500 you know things that aren't
sw4707B-ms98-a-0015 87.988500 90.426125 like [noise] groceries and that it's not on them
sw4707B-ms98-a-0016 90.426125 91.689750 [silence]

sw4707B-ms98-a-0020 96.621500 97.655500 [silence]
sw4707B-ms98-a-0021 97.655500 103.852125 we have a pretty low income ta[x]- i mean pretty low tax rate here oh i think tha[t]- the sales tax they just got to do something about it
sw4707B-ms98-a-0022 103.852125 108.037500 but that's the {politicalness} of trying to not create any new taxes 
sw4707B-ms98-a-0023 108.037500 136.586125 [silence]
sw4707B-ms98-a-0024 136.586125 145.508500 well and i still think having lived in Europe for awhile you know [noise] the difference in living conditions are certainly well worth uh what we pay for it
sw4707B-ms98-a-0025 145.508500 149.039250 [silence]
sw4707B-ms98-a-0026 149.039250 152.870375 well i mean i think i was in Germany you know for several years
sw4707B-ms98-a-0027 152.870375 158.927875 [noise] and i'd a lot rather pay taxes here and have what we have than have to live there
sw4707B-ms98-a-0028 158.927875 160.870750 [silence]
sw4707B-ms98-a-0029 160.870750 163.402125 higher taxes yeah

sw4707B-ms98-a-0031 168.777125 171.562250 still is that way to some extent
sw4707B-ms98-a-0032 171.562250 180.209125 [noise] i think the other problem is you know it's it's easy to complain about taxes because they're something you theoretically can do something about
sw4707B-ms98-a-0033 180.209125 193.521000 but i look for example and you you're not in the quite in the same situation but like school taxes for me biggest bargain in the world i wish i didn't have to pay [noise] any more fo[r]- fo[r]- to my physicians in a year than i had to pay for all of my school taxes
sw4707B-ms98-a-0034 193.521000 198.402000 [silence]

sw4707B-ms98-a-0045 284.778250 292.578750 [silence]
