sw4707A-ms98-a-0016 35.168750 38.534875 uh i love the irony of uh
sw4707A-ms98-a-0017 38.534875 42.303000 talking about this subject on April the fifteenth
sw4707A-ms98-a-0018 42.303000 50.108375 but um i'm afraid i'm i['m]- i'm probably in the minority i- i actually don't think that we uh pay too much in this country
sw4707A-ms98-a-0019 50.108375 56.997125 um um particularly uh in this part of the country wh[ere]- um i guess
sw4707A-ms98-a-0020 56.997125 62.653250 i do have a uh a bone to pick with um uh the way taxes are distributed
sw4707A-ms98-a-0021 62.653250 73.149875 um i just finished fuming at the fact that we pay an eight and a half percent sales tax and no income tax when the income tax could have been deducted from a federal form
sw4707A-ms98-a-0022 73.149875 77.758000 and the sales tax can't i think that's regressive and uh
sw4707A-ms98-a-0023 77.758000 79.319750 um
sw4707A-ms98-a-0024 79.319750 81.152500 it's kind of dumb
sw4707A-ms98-a-0025 81.152500 89.878875 [silence]
sw4707A-ms98-a-0026 89.878875 94.364250 well i mean nobody taxes groceries do they where
sw4707A-ms98-a-0027 94.364250 96.381125 is that right

sw4707A-ms98-a-0030 103.144125 104.888500 right it's

sw4707A-ms98-a-0032 107.426750 109.071125 right [noise]
sw4707A-ms98-a-0033 109.071125 117.665750 but i guess when i hear whe[n]- when i see the comparison between the United States and uh any other western country
sw4707A-ms98-a-0034 117.665750 124.893250 uh their their rates are like uh forty one forty two and ours are like thirty six thirty seven
sw4707A-ms98-a-0035 124.893250 132.498125 you know if you compute it as a percentage of total income all taxes lumped together we actually do pretty well
sw4707A-ms98-a-0036 132.498125 136.943000 th[ere's]- th[ere's]- there's no other country that's that is taxed as low as we are

sw4707A-ms98-a-0040 145.043875 146.547125 uh-huh
sw4707A-ms98-a-0041 146.547125 149.301000 i'm i'm not sure i understand what you mean
sw4707A-ms98-a-0042 149.301000 151.994000 [silence]
sw4707A-ms98-a-0043 151.994000 153.245250 right

sw4707A-ms98-a-0045 158.072250 169.673375 [noise] oh you mean lowest end of living in spite of low[er]- higher uh yeah i suppose that's true yeah um probably mo[re]- less so now than it was ten years ago or whenever but
sw4707A-ms98-a-0046 169.673375 170.805250 [noise]
sw4707A-ms98-a-0047 170.805250 172.025750 yeah

sw4707A-ms98-a-0055 192.593625 193.810000 yeah
sw4707A-ms98-a-0056 193.810000 195.771000 yeah since uh
sw4707A-ms98-a-0057 195.771000 199.961875 i send my kids to parochial school that's uh
sw4707A-ms98-a-0058 199.961875 205.328375 it's not it's not quite the bargain that [laughter-a] [laughter-guy] [laughter-would] [laughter-think] [noise]
sw4707A-ms98-a-0059 205.328375 211.935000 but i mean i pay them gladly that's a decision i think it's a dumb decision on our part because
sw4707A-ms98-a-0060 211.935000 221.650125 countries like Canada and England and Germany do perfectly well with a uh two tract system in which religious schools coexist with secular schools for the with the same tax money
sw4707A-ms98-a-0061 221.650125 226.846250 but uh i mean that's uh that's the way the Americans want to interpret it i guess that's all right
sw4707A-ms98-a-0062 226.846250 239.470750 but yeah i and if i were uh when i was single and again when i'm retired i will not mind paying uh what it takes to keep the schools good that's always been a high priority you know
sw4707A-ms98-a-0063 239.470750 240.889500 [noise]
sw4707A-ms98-a-0064 240.889500 249.207750 i do thi[nk]- yeah that's true i think in places i think in places like California people are beginning to find that in in areas that are fairly well off
sw4707A-ms98-a-0065 249.207750 263.711000 if you add the um uh people of various sexual persuasions and those who never intend to marry and those who are retired and those who are um just looking for fun the[y]- people with families turn out to be such a small minority that they can't get the tax bill passed no matter what happens
sw4707A-ms98-a-0066 263.711000 272.321375 and uh [noise] there are big sections of the country where people with children of school age are such a small minority that they can't get anything done
sw4707A-ms98-a-0067 272.321375 273.800750 that seems um
sw4707A-ms98-a-0068 273.800750 279.515750 um like a cultural lapse i mean people were always used to be willing to ante up for the schools they
sw4707A-ms98-a-0069 279.515750 283.630250 [silence]
sw4707A-ms98-a-0070 283.630250 291.661250 right yeah people would rather um increase the fire department and cut down the schools [laughter] because_1 it means more to them
sw4707A-ms98-a-0071 291.661250 293.615875 but i think it's sad
sw4707A-ms98-a-0072 293.615875 296.675250 selfish and shortsighted yeah
sw4707A-ms98-a-0073 296.675250 298.171375 well
sw4707A-ms98-a-0074 298.171375 298.946000 uh
