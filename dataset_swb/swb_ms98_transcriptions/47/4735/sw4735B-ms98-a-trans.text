sw4735B-ms98-a-0011 58.315875 70.509625 hum well that's a good idea to have it as a study program for school where it'd be more on a voluntary basis as opposed to uh mandatory
sw4735B-ms98-a-0012 70.509625 74.893375 yeah an[d]- yeah i kind of agree with that um
sw4735B-ms98-a-0013 74.893375 81.276250 i don't think you know i[t]- it they shouldn't have they should have the same rights as anyone else
sw4735B-ms98-a-0014 81.276250 92.400500 you know it shouldn't be uh anything shouldn't be mandatory other than i guess like uh when you come to paying taxes or something like that
sw4735B-ms98-a-0015 92.400500 97.871500 uh or if it's beneficial in some kind of way then maybe
sw4735B-ms98-a-0016 97.871500 103.555375 uh people be more [eagle/eager] to do it uh-huh yeah

sw4735B-ms98-a-0025 190.986125 196.096875 uh that's a good idea uh i think they should have more programs like that
sw4735B-ms98-a-0026 196.096875 205.967875 and i think uh us being taxpayers we pay for people that's in jail or in trouble anyway
sw4735B-ms98-a-0027 205.967875 213.836500 so they should be programs set up by the government that could utilize those forms in different areas
sw4735B-ms98-a-0028 213.836500 216.934500 and i i agree wholeheartedly
sw4735B-ms98-a-0029 216.934500 223.916500 yeah but uh the thing is that it's not enough of that kind of stuff going on uh
sw4735B-ms98-a-0030 223.916500 233.692500 because_1 you like you say it's a lot of crimes and stuff or misdemeanors wh[y]- why have someone in you[r]- jail for a year or two for a misdemeanor
sw4735B-ms98-a-0031 233.692500 238.145375 and sometimes you know putting them_1 in jail i[t]- doesn't really help
sw4735B-ms98-a-0032 238.145375 250.374000 because there's nothing in there that to [rebil/rehabilitate] [rebilitate/rehabilitate] re[habilitate]- [rebilihatate/rehabilitate] them and then when they get out they because they have the {stigmatism} of being in jail they ca[n't]-
