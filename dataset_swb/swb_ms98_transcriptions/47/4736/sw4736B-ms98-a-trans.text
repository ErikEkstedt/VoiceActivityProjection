sw4736B-ms98-a-0003 13.184000 18.598625 um yeah that's that's far back as i can remember well that's before my time actually
sw4736B-ms98-a-0004 18.598625 22.411250 [silence]
sw4736B-ms98-a-0005 22.411250 23.672875 um-hum
sw4736B-ms98-a-0006 23.672875 66.958375 [silence]
sw4736B-ms98-a-0007 66.958375 68.177250 um-hum

sw4736B-ms98-a-0009 78.654125 87.638375 well i think that currently the the way the law stands isn't so much that the laws are enforceable or not it's more they're not enforcing the death penalty itself it's
sw4736B-ms98-a-0010 87.638375 101.159125 it's to the point where they're saying like here you're you're going on death row but you'll stay there for twenty years and nothing's being done about it um the laws exist and too many times they're frequently upheld in in um
sw4736B-ms98-a-0011 101.159125 114.905750 in in Appeals Court just because of technicalities and because of maybe small little holes that their defending attorney can find and it's it's really getting out of [hanters/hand] in mo[st]- many states
sw4736B-ms98-a-0012 114.905750 240.157000 [silence]
sw4736B-ms98-a-0013 240.157000 250.299500 [noise] well it seems like [noise] well it it seems as if in the past um typically there have been a lo[t]- a lot of cases of people being wrongly tried or wrongly punished and the whole
sw4736B-ms98-a-0014 250.299500 254.824750 the whole idea behind the current criminal process system
sw4736B-ms98-a-0015 254.824750 262.858000 is to protect those who actually didn't commit the crimes all be it it seems that we are failing in that in that ultimate goal
sw4736B-ms98-a-0016 262.858000 269.162500 because there are times when people wh[o]- who are guilty are getting off
sw4736B-ms98-a-0017 269.162500 276.825875 um for instance um there's a case a few years back where um someone um someone who's being
sw4736B-ms98-a-0018 276.825875 289.229500 convicted for was under a tri[al]- was going to trial for murder was let off because of a technicality that the off[icer]- the arresting officer um did not read the defendant their rights
sw4736B-ms98-a-0019 289.229500 298.946000 and where as all the evidence was there the witnesses were there the e[verything]- everything was conclusively pointing to this individual yet
