sw4758B-ms98-a-0010 31.371125 32.813375 you know
sw4758B-ms98-a-0011 32.813375 42.601875 well i have a bunch of computer journals because i'm in computer science but beyond that uh lately i've been reading i've always liked the New Yorker
sw4758B-ms98-a-0012 42.601875 51.564000 and lately i've been picking up some of the travel uh both trade magazines and just the general travel magazines
sw4758B-ms98-a-0013 51.564000 54.736750 um trying to keep up on what's going on
sw4758B-ms98-a-0014 54.736750 60.699750 and my wife also gets a lot of the food magazines Bon Appetite and Food and Wine and Gourmet
sw4758B-ms98-a-0015 60.699750 63.638750 yeah and sh[e]- and she still likes to get Time 
sw4758B-ms98-a-0016 63.638750 66.916625 which i've never liked very much but she seems to
sw4758B-ms98-a-0017 66.916625 78.386250 [silence]
sw4758B-ms98-a-0018 78.386250 80.234000 do you read a newspaper
sw4758B-ms98-a-0019 80.234000 80.846250 [silence]
sw4758B-ms98-a-0020 80.846250 82.187000 [laughter]
sw4758B-ms98-a-0021 82.187000 83.413125 yeah
sw4758B-ms98-a-0022 83.413125 106.141375 [silence]
sw4758B-ms98-a-0023 106.141375 106.846625 [noise]
sw4758B-ms98-a-0024 106.846625 113.365375 some of them i used to get for the advertising like Byte magazine which is uh
sw4758B-ms98-a-0025 113.365375 115.899000 one of the larger computer ones
sw4758B-ms98-a-0026 115.899000 124.014625 i haven't bought it now for about eight years but when i used to get it it was about five hundred pages about three hundred of them advertising
sw4758B-ms98-a-0027 124.014625 128.282250 because that was interesting i think a lot of the trade magazines are like that
sw4758B-ms98-a-0028 128.282250 132.341375 that that half the fun is finding out what all the products are
sw4758B-ms98-a-0029 132.341375 138.204875 but you know some of the get ridiculous Travel and Leisure all of the American Express magazines
sw4758B-ms98-a-0030 138.204875 153.110250 so Travel and Leisure Food and Wine and i think they have some others uh certainly half the pages and maybe more are pure ads plus they have the advertising supplement sections that are supposed to look like articles but are paid for and
sw4758B-ms98-a-0031 153.110250 164.407500 [laughter-it] [laughter-is] it's clear that i i've bought some of these [noise] through wholesalers [noise] and they don't care if they make any money on the magazine subscription they're making everything on ads
sw4758B-ms98-a-0032 164.407500 182.710125 [silence]
sw4758B-ms98-a-0033 182.710125 183.990125 um-hum
sw4758B-ms98-a-0034 183.990125 185.882750 [silence]
sw4758B-ms98-a-0035 185.882750 190.899125 have you ever um read or subscribe to Consumer Reports for any length of time
sw4758B-ms98-a-0036 190.899125 196.376625 [silence]
sw4758B-ms98-a-0037 196.376625 197.510125 [laughter]
sw4758B-ms98-a-0038 197.510125 199.005375 but not worth it
sw4758B-ms98-a-0039 199.005375 207.926875 i i've always had this one of the reasons i like to to pick up magazines in other fields is that you seem to get a very different perspective so
sw4758B-ms98-a-0040 207.926875 215.825500 i've always had this problem with Consumer Reports that in the areas that i know a lot about i disagree with them
sw4758B-ms98-a-0041 215.825500 222.391500 and i always wonder whether there are people who know a lot about every area disagreeing with them on everything
sw4758B-ms98-a-0042 222.391500 224.622125 or or what's [laughter-going] on
sw4758B-ms98-a-0043 224.622125 232.256500 so i've like i've picked up now a subscription to one of the travel agent uh organization magazines and
sw4758B-ms98-a-0044 232.256500 236.362750 it's a ridiculous difference when you start reading from their perspective
sw4758B-ms98-a-0045 236.362750 241.301625 um you know their major interest is in commissions and
sw4758B-ms98-a-0046 241.301625 256.186125 you know there's very little talk about the quality of places or airlines their major talk is about you know commissions and commission rebates and how they won't suggest hotels to people if the commission's not a the full ten percent or whatever it is and
sw4758B-ms98-a-0047 256.186125 259.346125 it gives you a different [laughter-perspective] on what people do [noise]
sw4758B-ms98-a-0048 259.346125 260.564250 [silence]
sw4758B-ms98-a-0049 260.564250 261.789250 yeah
sw4758B-ms98-a-0050 261.789250 265.607375 [silence]
sw4758B-ms98-a-0051 265.607375 271.001000 uh some of them the the general travel magazines do i don't tend to read it for that
sw4758B-ms98-a-0052 271.001000 280.598250 because_1 i don't [laughter-expect] [laughter-to] [laughter-be] [laughter-traveling] [laughter-overseas] in in the future for quite awhile but i- i usually just read through the sections on on domestic stuff
sw4758B-ms98-a-0053 280.598250 290.019375 [silence]
sw4758B-ms98-a-0054 290.019375 291.597875 no
sw4758B-ms98-a-0055 291.597875 295.147375 yeah i don't take in much more in myself
sw4758B-ms98-a-0056 295.147375 296.254375 [silence]
sw4758B-ms98-a-0057 296.254375 297.939000 okay
