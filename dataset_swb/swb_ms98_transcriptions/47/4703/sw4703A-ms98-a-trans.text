sw4703A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.064000 [silence] 
sw4703A-ms98-a-0002 0.064000 1.066625 okay
sw4703A-ms98-a-0003 1.066625 3.824125 [silence]
sw4703A-ms98-a-0004 3.824125 14.703375 well i can see it in certain cases where it might be uh somebody's in a position that uh perhaps a lot of lives are involved like maybe um pilots that
sw4703A-ms98-a-0005 14.703375 16.192500 um uh
sw4703A-ms98-a-0006 16.192500 30.213125 you you know fly jets and uh maybe people that have a lot of responsibility over a large mass of people i could certainly see it being done but in general
sw4703A-ms98-a-0007 30.213125 43.698625 um you know whether companies wanna do this and i know that companies do like factory workers that have lots of accidents are now being drug tested i know a couple of corporations that are doing that
sw4703A-ms98-a-0008 43.698625 52.272500 um so you know they kind of have gotten into the idea that let's drug test them and let's put them through rehab but
sw4703A-ms98-a-0009 52.272500 65.139375 there's got to be like a limitation do we drug test everybody that comes in or do we kind of say well you can be drug tested and you look okay because you look this way you're you're very conservative and and
sw4703A-ms98-a-0010 65.139375 74.072000 there's just no way that we would think that you would use drugs but the guy that doesn't fit the stereotype of uh the conservative or whatever could be drug tested
sw4703A-ms98-a-0011 74.072000 88.419125 and uh you know whether legal rights and of that person i don't know there's certainly a lot of things to really consider uh when you get into drug testing people
sw4703A-ms98-a-0012 88.419125 98.161250 just at the work place unless of course like i said they have a large responsibility over a mass of people uh that's about it
sw4703A-ms98-a-0013 98.161250 100.550375 [silence]
sw4703A-ms98-a-0014 100.550375 102.417125 um-hum um-hum
sw4703A-ms98-a-0015 102.417125 111.723125 [silence]
sw4703A-ms98-a-0016 111.723125 118.779750 sure sure and i think that's what companies are doing uh more and more because there are products that are out there
sw4703A-ms98-a-0017 118.779750 127.775375 [silence]
sw4703A-ms98-a-0018 127.775375 129.097875 um-hum
sw4703A-ms98-a-0019 129.097875 131.700125 [silence]
sw4703A-ms98-a-0020 131.700125 133.562000 exactly
sw4703A-ms98-a-0021 133.562000 136.013250 sure sure
sw4703A-ms98-a-0022 136.013250 141.373000 [silence]
sw4703A-ms98-a-0023 141.373000 142.487125 sure
sw4703A-ms98-a-0024 142.487125 144.334875 [silence]
sw4703A-ms98-a-0025 144.334875 147.005250 exactly the only thing is
sw4703A-ms98-a-0026 147.005250 153.550125 [silence]
sw4703A-ms98-a-0027 153.550125 155.244750 exactly
sw4703A-ms98-a-0028 155.244750 168.411625 exactly the only thing is uh the one issue that i would take stands with is the fact that the drug testing itself can be done on a person that is actually not on drugs and come out positive
sw4703A-ms98-a-0029 168.411625 177.319875 if they have had like uh medications in the past let's say once a month or twice a month or three times a month or maybe um that week they take an Advil
sw4703A-ms98-a-0030 177.319875 183.782125 and the Advil will apparently come out positive as if they smoked marijuana
sw4703A-ms98-a-0031 183.782125 196.667250 um and there's poppy seed type things i think everybody's aware of that but um where's the line where you where you say to somebody i'm gonna drug test you tomorrow so please do not take these medications or where's
sw4703A-ms98-a-0032 196.667250 199.585250 you know how can you how can you do it
sw4703A-ms98-a-0033 199.585250 203.778375 [silence]
sw4703A-ms98-a-0034 203.778375 205.403625 exactly
sw4703A-ms98-a-0035 205.403625 206.899250 [silence]
sw4703A-ms98-a-0036 206.899250 208.114000 um-hum
sw4703A-ms98-a-0037 208.114000 209.772625 [silence]
sw4703A-ms98-a-0038 209.772625 211.381750 sure
sw4703A-ms98-a-0039 211.381750 220.729375 sure exactly an[d]- and the the only thing that i would say on that is it could blacklist an employee later on let's say um
sw4703A-ms98-a-0040 220.729375 228.263500 you've taken medication of some sort even though they usually have you at the time list what medications you've taken
sw4703A-ms98-a-0041 228.263500 242.159000 uh let's say you do come out positive and you've taken Advil or any of the Ibuprofen products out there or you've had a cold and you've been on medication or whatever you come out positive
sw4703A-ms98-a-0042 242.159000 250.193500 is it then the chance that the employer will look at you in more of a negative fashion and say well you know
sw4703A-ms98-a-0043 250.193500 260.375125 this is kind of iffy you know are they really on drugs or are they on [thrugs/drugs] you know what i'm saying where there might be in the back of the mind of the employer that this person
sw4703A-ms98-a-0044 260.375125 268.574750 uh is on drugs or make up they may make up their mind that let's get rid of this employee you know what i'm saying
sw4703A-ms98-a-0045 268.574750 272.127250 [silence]
sw4703A-ms98-a-0046 272.127250 273.435000 um-hum
sw4703A-ms98-a-0047 273.435000 280.321750 [silence]
sw4703A-ms98-a-0048 280.321750 293.276875 exactly and it's a they can that uh if it does come out positive the first time they need to go back and find out what medications did that person take you know what i mean it it's kind of like
sw4703A-ms98-a-0049 293.276875 298.626000 uh i think most people are aware at least now common knowledge is that
