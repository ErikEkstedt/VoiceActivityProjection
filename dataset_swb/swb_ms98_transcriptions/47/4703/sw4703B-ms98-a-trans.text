sw4703B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.436625 [noise]
sw4703B-ms98-a-0002 0.436625 4.546000 so what is your opinion on on drug testing
sw4703B-ms98-a-0003 4.546000 96.016125 [silence]
sw4703B-ms98-a-0004 96.016125 108.068375 well yeah you're it it's not just a com[pany's]- you're talking about company's liability if if if uh if the company is liable for something that that a employee does while under the influence of
sw4703B-ms98-a-0005 108.068375 114.495875 of a drug you know then by all means they should have the right to to to
sw4703B-ms98-a-0006 114.495875 115.986875 [silence]
sw4703B-ms98-a-0007 115.986875 117.058375 to
sw4703B-ms98-a-0008 117.058375 118.088375 [silence]
sw4703B-ms98-a-0009 118.088375 128.432500 to minimize their liability and there's also the case about just uh um health health and welfare of the um employees
sw4703B-ms98-a-0010 128.432500 139.749125 if a company has a healthy work force their insurance rates are low and not only a[re]- not only they low there's all sorts of a of a benefits
sw4703B-ms98-a-0011 139.749125 145.405125 uh financial benefits associated with having you know having people file fewer claims being sick
sw4703B-ms98-a-0012 145.405125 155.930375 uh then there's the[re's]- there's the whole question that that a that a work force that is known not to be on drugs is gonna be more healthy i don't think anybody would argue with that
sw4703B-ms98-a-0013 155.930375 167.686750 [silence]
sw4703B-ms98-a-0014 167.686750 169.316875 right
sw4703B-ms98-a-0015 169.316875 183.058375 [silence]
sw4703B-ms98-a-0016 183.058375 184.484625 right
sw4703B-ms98-a-0017 184.484625 196.035625 [silence]
sw4703B-ms98-a-0018 196.035625 198.231750 well well the ques[tion]-
sw4703B-ms98-a-0019 198.231750 204.599750 right the question becomes what do you do about somebody who [testses/tests] who test positive
sw4703B-ms98-a-0020 204.599750 212.978625 th[at's]- that's where the real sticking point comes in it's not i don't think there's any problem with testing people it's what do you do with the information
sw4703B-ms98-a-0021 212.978625 256.015250 [silence]
sw4703B-ms98-a-0022 256.015250 257.478750 right
sw4703B-ms98-a-0023 257.478750 266.474375 [silence]
sw4703B-ms98-a-0024 266.474375 277.694250 right well yeah i think clearly the person who is the line o[perator]- line manager of the employee should not be privy to the information of drug testing that should go to an entirely different
sw4703B-ms98-a-0025 277.694250 282.882000 um agency within the corporation um
sw4703B-ms98-a-0026 282.882000 298.626000 [silence]
