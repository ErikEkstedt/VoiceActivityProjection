sw4792B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.561000 [noise]
sw4792B-ms98-a-0002 1.561000 5.148625 hi this is Jim Bliss from Minneapolis Minnesota how you doing
sw4792B-ms98-a-0003 5.148625 16.525250 good um i guess the topic is trial by jury and how we should change that or how how we would change it um i'm ready whenever you are
sw4792B-ms98-a-0004 16.525250 18.773750 [silence]
sw4792B-ms98-a-0005 18.773750 22.802125 so uh what are your what are your thoughts on the subject there
sw4792B-ms98-a-0006 22.802125 25.243750 [silence]
sw4792B-ms98-a-0007 25.243750 26.552375 yeah
sw4792B-ms98-a-0008 26.552375 29.663500 yeah i think that's probably a a good thing
sw4792B-ms98-a-0009 29.663500 36.144250 yeah i mean it's to to easy to get a quorum and simple majority won't do
sw4792B-ms98-a-0010 36.144250 39.533250 [silence]
sw4792B-ms98-a-0011 39.533250 53.167750 yeah that's yeah quorums are to easy to get and there's always that that chance that one or two people could be playing devil's advocate for a good reason you know so it's it's yeah definitely
sw4792B-ms98-a-0012 53.167750 61.574125 but um i don't know i[t]- i could i couldn't believe they suggested that judges should be doing the sentencing
sw4792B-ms98-a-0013 61.574125 62.655875 [silence]
sw4792B-ms98-a-0014 62.655875 72.417875 yeah [laughter] tha[t]- i- i know of a couple of people at least who would be arguing with that or arguing against that pretty vehemently but um
sw4792B-ms98-a-0015 72.417875 77.856625 [silence]
sw4792B-ms98-a-0016 77.856625 85.296500 yeah about the only good thing i would see about that is that would it that it would um hurry the process up a bit 
sw4792B-ms98-a-0017 85.296500 93.584125 but i mean even now we've got i know we've got plenty of cases out there where people have been wrongly convicted and things like that
sw4792B-ms98-a-0018 93.584125 101.608000 and that's what the trial by jury i mean jeez if it if the judge was doing it himself without any checks and balances
sw4792B-ms98-a-0019 101.608000 103.201250 whose to say
sw4792B-ms98-a-0020 103.201250 104.924500 [laughter-yeah] no doubt
sw4792B-ms98-a-0021 104.924500 107.622125 are you involved in the legal system at all
sw4792B-ms98-a-0022 107.622125 109.229875 okay
sw4792B-ms98-a-0023 109.229875 112.375250 [silence]
sw4792B-ms98-a-0024 112.375250 115.912125 yeah yeah i've got some friends that are lawyers so
sw4792B-ms98-a-0025 115.912125 118.394000 one of them_1 just got his law degree
sw4792B-ms98-a-0026 118.394000 123.045000 but um to tell you the truth i'm not real familiar with um
sw4792B-ms98-a-0027 123.045000 128.918000 the system of juris[prudence]- jurisprudence the way it is right now i really haven't studied it in depth
sw4792B-ms98-a-0028 128.918000 131.503000 [silence]
sw4792B-ms98-a-0029 131.503000 132.786250 yeah
sw4792B-ms98-a-0030 132.786250 136.087000 [silence]
sw4792B-ms98-a-0031 136.087000 143.257125 i'm sure of it because_1 a lot of those things it's all it's in it's largely a matter of viewpoint and who can argue their case better
sw4792B-ms98-a-0032 143.257125 145.513125 um it's kind of weird
sw4792B-ms98-a-0033 145.513125 150.602000 i don't know [laughter-yeah] i always think about watching the People's Court or something
sw4792B-ms98-a-0034 150.602000 153.493500 and how weird those cases get
sw4792B-ms98-a-0035 153.493500 155.605125 it's just [vocalized-noise]
sw4792B-ms98-a-0036 155.605125 157.888375 [silence]
sw4792B-ms98-a-0037 157.888375 159.176250 yeah
sw4792B-ms98-a-0038 159.176250 163.746375 [silence]
sw4792B-ms98-a-0039 163.746375 171.070125 um-hum and it's like boy the stuff that they can twist around is it's pretty amazing
sw4792B-ms98-a-0040 171.070125 172.684625 [silence]
sw4792B-ms98-a-0041 172.684625 174.352875 yeah it's not
sw4792B-ms98-a-0042 174.352875 184.767500 and then you get people who who bring in cases just because they want to bring them_1 up just because like this this friend of mine's pretty obnoxious and he really gets into suing people
sw4792B-ms98-a-0043 184.767500 190.911250 and so he'll he'll sue just about anybody just for the chance to get into court and argue his case
sw4792B-ms98-a-0044 190.911250 192.592000 [laughter-you] [laughter-know] it's like
sw4792B-ms98-a-0045 192.592000 194.468375 [silence]
sw4792B-ms98-a-0046 194.468375 201.712875 it is it's it's wasting people's time and the taxpayers' money and everything else but uh
sw4792B-ms98-a-0047 201.712875 203.919250 [silence]
sw4792B-ms98-a-0048 203.919250 205.126625 yeah
sw4792B-ms98-a-0049 205.126625 209.673625 and uh and and most of the time they're looking to place blame um
sw4792B-ms98-a-0050 209.673625 213.198375 and stuff see you're from California is that right
sw4792B-ms98-a-0051 213.198375 214.565625 hum
sw4792B-ms98-a-0052 214.565625 224.902000 oh okay i was just thinking i wonder i wonder how how the civil system or the the court systems differ between there and say where i am in Minneapolis
sw4792B-ms98-a-0053 224.902000 229.864500 i mean from what i understand it's all pretty much the same except when you get to Louisiana
sw4792B-ms98-a-0054 229.864500 240.786125 and Louisiana is completely different cause it was based on the what is it it's based on common law and the rest of the country is not or something like that it's pretty strange 
sw4792B-ms98-a-0055 240.786125 242.852000 but uh
sw4792B-ms98-a-0056 242.852000 248.417000 fortunately i never have had to go in even even for jury duty
sw4792B-ms98-a-0057 248.417000 250.112125 but um
sw4792B-ms98-a-0058 250.112125 256.975875 that friend of mine's telling me that i might have to go in for uh as a witness he may subpoena me
sw4792B-ms98-a-0059 256.975875 259.102500 so we'll see what happens
sw4792B-ms98-a-0060 259.102500 260.710250 but uh
sw4792B-ms98-a-0061 260.710250 263.441875 [silence]
sw4792B-ms98-a-0062 263.441875 270.819250 yeah it's there are too many big problems you know there's there's such a backlog of court cases right now
sw4792B-ms98-a-0063 270.819250 274.267875 you know to try to get them all in in a good time
sw4792B-ms98-a-0064 274.267875 277.573125 and we already have too many lawyers as it is
sw4792B-ms98-a-0065 277.573125 280.531500 [silence]
sw4792B-ms98-a-0066 280.531500 281.803000 yeah
sw4792B-ms98-a-0067 281.803000 292.581750 yeah that's true and in fact they're even letting some go i'm i'm o[riginally]- i'm originally from Florida and it's like it seems like every year they let out more and more just because_1 they don't have room for them_1
sw4792B-ms98-a-0068 292.581750 296.289625 you know that's not a that's not a good solution either
sw4792B-ms98-a-0069 296.289625 298.850000 so i'm not real sure what to
