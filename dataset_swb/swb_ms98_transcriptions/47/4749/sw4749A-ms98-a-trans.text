sw4749A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 8.487625 now um we're driving a nineteen eighty five uh Buick Park Avenue that's still on the road [laughter] 
sw4749A-ms98-a-0002 8.487625 9.502750 [silence]
sw4749A-ms98-a-0003 9.502750 18.598125 [laughter-yeah] [laughter] it's uh it it's an interesting car with all sorts of problems that crop up now that it's in it's seventh year
sw4749A-ms98-a-0004 18.598125 25.225000 [laughter-and] uh like anytime anything happens it's immediately five hundred dollar repair or
sw4749A-ms98-a-0005 25.225000 34.870375 what have you so i uh you know in looking for the next car that we get here we're gonna look for something that has a very good track record that
sw4749A-ms98-a-0006 34.870375 38.838250 isn't going to cost us a bundle every time something goes wrong
sw4749A-ms98-a-0007 38.838250 83.129375 [silence]
sw4749A-ms98-a-0008 83.129375 96.348875 yeah i i've continually i've come to learn in having this car that it was fully loaded when we got it and the problem is it's the fully loaded gives the car more chances for things to go [laughter-wrong]
sw4749A-ms98-a-0009 96.348875 105.499125 that make it not drivable and [noise] i'd heard good things about the Hondas uh especially the Accord um
sw4749A-ms98-a-0010 105.499125 118.414875 but uh you know we've been we've been we've been an American car family for the most part for um a long time not because of any great desire to like wow we're just going to buy American because it's American [laughter]
sw4749A-ms98-a-0011 118.414875 126.976875 [laughter-but] but i don't know it's just been traditional type of uh General Motors type of car the last car we had was a um
sw4749A-ms98-a-0012 126.976875 131.254750 um a Grand Prix which never again [laughter]
sw4749A-ms98-a-0013 131.254750 137.756000 [laughter-that] was a nightmare that one tha[t]- i mean the thing just literally fell apart as time went on
sw4749A-ms98-a-0014 137.756000 142.915125 [silence]
sw4749A-ms98-a-0015 142.915125 153.551750 yeah it's it's been you know the the Park Avenue this year that's come out you know being a very high end type car uh they put a lot into it this year but the one in eighty five
sw4749A-ms98-a-0016 153.551750 156.693000 apparently was a problem year for them_1 because
sw4749A-ms98-a-0017 156.693000 165.738750 they you know what's happened is most people have just gotten rid of them as soon as you know they pass the three year mark and things start going they go and buy a new car
sw4749A-ms98-a-0018 165.738750 169.073750 well with the Northeast and the recession up here
sw4749A-ms98-a-0019 169.073750 180.212000 you know that's certainly not an easy option and [noise] uh we've kind of stuck with it trying to keep it you know we figure sooner or later we'll probably replace everything on the silly thing and [laughter]
sw4749A-ms98-a-0020 180.212000 185.786875 [laughter-yeah] [laughter-i] [laughter-know] know then [laughter-when] one of the doors fall off then it's time to get a new car [laughter-you] [laughter-know]
sw4749A-ms98-a-0021 185.786875 199.983500 [silence]
sw4749A-ms98-a-0022 199.983500 201.336875 yeah
sw4749A-ms98-a-0023 201.336875 210.119875 [silence]
sw4749A-ms98-a-0024 210.119875 211.505250 yeah
sw4749A-ms98-a-0025 211.505250 220.686000 [silence]
sw4749A-ms98-a-0026 220.686000 222.002625 um-hum
sw4749A-ms98-a-0027 222.002625 229.626750 [silence]
sw4749A-ms98-a-0028 229.626750 230.997875 [laughter]
sw4749A-ms98-a-0029 230.997875 232.479750 [noise]
sw4749A-ms98-a-0030 232.479750 237.846625 [silence]
sw4749A-ms98-a-0031 237.846625 244.286250 well you're in a climate that's a little bit more [laughter] where you ha[ve]- need the air conditioning more than we do up here [laughter]
sw4749A-ms98-a-0032 244.286250 245.477250 [silence]
sw4749A-ms98-a-0033 245.477250 254.182500 [noise] yeah see up here it's it's de[finitely]- definitely an option type thing because we only have about three months of really hot weather
sw4749A-ms98-a-0034 254.182500 260.281875 everything else is fairly moderate then we have the world famous Rochester slash Buffalo winters [laughter]
sw4749A-ms98-a-0035 260.281875 264.733125 [laughter-so] a sun roof is really a snow roof you know ooh look snow
sw4749A-ms98-a-0036 264.733125 272.803250 [laughter] [laughter-i] [laughter-mean] [laughter-i] [laughter-think] what else you're going to see you know [laughter] looking up at your doom as the snow comes pummeling down but
sw4749A-ms98-a-0037 272.803250 279.409625 well that's the other thing is a car needs to be able to handle the salt up here that they pour on the roads
sw4749A-ms98-a-0038 279.409625 289.431625 and that's what kills cars up here is you know the salt rusts them out and then they die years before y[ou]- you know a car from California might be undrivable
sw4749A-ms98-a-0039 289.431625 292.809875 [silence]
sw4749A-ms98-a-0040 292.809875 298.306000 yeah that's that's what happened basically to our last car i mean it just this rust took over and
