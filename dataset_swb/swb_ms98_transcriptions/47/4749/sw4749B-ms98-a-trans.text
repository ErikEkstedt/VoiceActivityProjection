sw4749B-ms98-a-0011 38.233625 44.412750 well i can tell you about reliability the last two cars i've had have both been Honda Accords
sw4749B-ms98-a-0012 44.412750 52.071500 and uh i mean it's pro[bably]- it's not a huge car but it's been very reliable and uh i was just very impressed by it
sw4749B-ms98-a-0013 52.071500 62.527375 uh when i first looked at it and when i talked to other people that had Hondas they cost a little more and when i was looking for them the dealer just wouldn't negotiate at all because they're such a big demand but
sw4749B-ms98-a-0014 62.527375 70.116500 it had all the features i needed the uh you know the power and the uh adjustability and power windows and things like that
sw4749B-ms98-a-0015 70.116500 83.132500 and the dashboard just looked good to me it was just no nonsense had the the s[peedometer]- uh speedometer and the tach and the couple of other little gauges like engine heat but none of the you know big flashy electronic stuff

sw4749B-ms98-a-0036 184.414875 193.980375 [laughter-great] yeah well Chrysler is supposed to be when if you're looking at reliability Chrysler's supposed to be one of the best American cars right now
sw4749B-ms98-a-0037 193.980375 200.662500 and the American cars the uh one advantage one a[dvantage]- one big advantage they still have is you can typically find them for a lot less
sw4749B-ms98-a-0038 200.662500 204.283000 so anyway but uh
sw4749B-ms98-a-0039 204.283000 214.963750 some of the other things i like about well some of the things i don't like usually are um the flashy stuff you know the all the doors lock when you do something or uh um
sw4749B-ms98-a-0040 214.963750 220.854250 i used to now i'm getting more to where i think i might like a a sun roof on my next car
sw4749B-ms98-a-0041 220.854250 230.167500 i'm not really sure about that because_1 i'm very much a person who uh likes to drive around with every with all the windows closed and the air conditioning on so i can hear my stereo well
sw4749B-ms98-a-0042 230.167500 238.622375 [laughter] but you know so a sun roof or or a tee top or something like that you're just going to have to crank the stereo up to compete with the wind noise
