sw4799B-ms98-a-0008 18.913000 24.086250 um not for my parents but i- i was around uh two sets of grandparents
sw4799B-ms98-a-0009 24.086250 31.404625 um quite a bit we we put one i put one grandfather in a rest home
sw4799B-ms98-a-0010 31.404625 33.175375 and
sw4799B-ms98-a-0011 33.175375 43.992750 that killed him [laughter] well yeah kind of well there was some other things involved but it before he was really active and
sw4799B-ms98-a-0012 43.992750 55.493875 the there was some you know he lo[st]- lost his drivers license and uh couldn't get around and wasn't able to do some things and so we ended up just having to put him in a rest home
sw4799B-ms98-a-0013 55.493875 58.976875 and he just kind of became a vegetable and died
sw4799B-ms98-a-0014 58.976875 65.536250 so but that was a long time ago that was uh back in like seventy three
sw4799B-ms98-a-0015 65.536250 71.446375 so um i think the way they did things were a lot different back then
sw4799B-ms98-a-0016 71.446375 73.124250 and uh
sw4799B-ms98-a-0017 73.124250 84.337750 my grandmother his his wife uh we also put her in a rest home she was in a rest home and then she was back out because she didn't really need to be there
sw4799B-ms98-a-0018 84.337750 88.686500 and uh had a physical had a good physical therapist at that place
sw4799B-ms98-a-0019 88.686500 91.121500 and they worked with her and
sw4799B-ms98-a-0020 91.121500 96.479375 got her walking and got her ta[king]- kind of taking care of herself and so she was able to come back home
sw4799B-ms98-a-0021 96.479375 101.314625 and then she had to go back in a couple of times
sw4799B-ms98-a-0022 101.314625 104.346375 but mostly it was just because she kind of gave up
sw4799B-ms98-a-0023 104.346375 106.997750 and they got her going again
sw4799B-ms98-a-0024 106.997750 112.706500 so i guess as far as looking and i said the as what you're looking for i think you need to look for an active
