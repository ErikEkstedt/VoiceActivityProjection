sw4771B-ms98-a-0003 26.994750 28.022500 right
sw4771B-ms98-a-0004 28.022500 32.831250 [silence]
sw4771B-ms98-a-0005 32.831250 40.740250 well tha[t's]- tha[t's]- that's true actually down here we don't have a big problem with uh with air pollution mainly because we don't have anybody to th[e]- either side of us
sw4771B-ms98-a-0006 40.740250 44.194000 uh which helps out a lot as far as that goes
sw4771B-ms98-a-0007 44.194000 52.045875 i wouldn't even necessarily thought of that except when i lived up in Boston and up in uh you know debates would come up up there in Massachusetts and
sw4771B-ms98-a-0008 52.045875 59.687875 you know in that area over uh air pollution and their attitude's basically well prevailing [ins/winds] winds are to the east so why should we have to worry
sw4771B-ms98-a-0009 59.687875 72.654750 [silence]
sw4771B-ms98-a-0010 72.654750 74.609250 oh yes nothing
sw4771B-ms98-a-0011 74.609250 109.272125 [silence]
sw4771B-ms98-a-0012 109.272125 110.498875 right
sw4771B-ms98-a-0013 110.498875 130.718750 [silence]
sw4771B-ms98-a-0014 130.718750 132.577375 oh absolutely yeah just muggy
sw4771B-ms98-a-0015 132.577375 137.062875 so yes i think y[ou're]- yeah i think you're right our most pollute substance down here is just water
sw4771B-ms98-a-0016 137.062875 138.926125 but [laughter-uh]
sw4771B-ms98-a-0017 138.926125 140.275875 hey
sw4771B-ms98-a-0018 140.275875 147.821625 i- i- i think you know the biggest causes though even then a lot of times are uh uh like when i was up in Boston just all the cars
sw4771B-ms98-a-0019 147.821625 150.720375 you know all over the place you just got a lot of
sw4771B-ms98-a-0020 150.720375 157.801125 you know a a lot of pollution from those and uh you know if you don't have a wind it sticks around
sw4771B-ms98-a-0021 157.801125 169.201250 [silence]
sw4771B-ms98-a-0022 169.201250 170.896250 absolutely
sw4771B-ms98-a-0023 170.896250 184.659250 [silence]
sw4771B-ms98-a-0024 184.659250 185.983375 right
sw4771B-ms98-a-0025 185.983375 200.560125 [silence]
sw4771B-ms98-a-0026 200.560125 202.372625 that's that's very true
sw4771B-ms98-a-0027 202.372625 209.343500 uh you know of course then when when you're not recycling you've got these incendiary plants and stuff that can be some pretty disgusting stuff
sw4771B-ms98-a-0028 209.343500 211.462875 going up in the atmosphere
sw4771B-ms98-a-0029 211.462875 219.755000 but i you know you['ve]- you've got you've got the industry you've got that and you got the cars and i think the cars are where where it's at right now as far as pollution goes
sw4771B-ms98-a-0030 219.755000 221.778750 a[ir]- air pollution i mean
sw4771B-ms98-a-0031 221.778750 236.510625 [silence]
sw4771B-ms98-a-0032 236.510625 237.594625 right

sw4771B-ms98-a-0034 245.744000 247.699375 i i guess so
sw4771B-ms98-a-0035 247.699375 263.790500 [silence]
sw4771B-ms98-a-0036 263.790500 268.613375 right i you know i i don't know in the air down here what they do uh
sw4771B-ms98-a-0037 268.613375 274.252875 i i haven't run across any major pollutants down there that i i i've really seen a lot of
sw4771B-ms98-a-0038 274.252875 276.174250 you know {upsettedness} about
sw4771B-ms98-a-0039 276.174250 277.352625 uh
sw4771B-ms98-a-0040 277.352625 284.500375 i i i know i've seen like uh my grandparents live in Corpus Christi Texas and i know they've there's a lot of refineries down there
sw4771B-ms98-a-0041 284.500375 287.855500 a[nd]- a[nd]- tha[t's]- that's some pretty potent stuff they can put up in the air
sw4771B-ms98-a-0042 287.855500 294.214125 i but i don't know how uh yeah there's a difference in what you can smell and what you uh you know what's bad
