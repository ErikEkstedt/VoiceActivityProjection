sw4771A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 2.397250 [noise] up here in Rochester uh
sw4771A-ms98-a-0002 2.397250 9.018375 we're the second cleanest metropolitan city as far as air pollution i think Grand Rapids was number one
sw4771A-ms98-a-0003 9.018375 19.958625 uh we really don't have too much of a problem as far as uh industry you know since we're pretty technologically based as far as our industry in the city here 
sw4771A-ms98-a-0004 19.958625 27.034750 but we do have the same problem a lot of are other areas up here in the northeast have and that is the effects of acid rain
sw4771A-ms98-a-0005 27.034750 32.147500 com[ing]- coming basically from coal plants in Ohio and Illinois and Indiana
sw4771A-ms98-a-0006 32.147500 60.123625 [silence]
sw4771A-ms98-a-0007 60.123625 65.917500 yeah i've i've uh was in Los Angeles once and that was quite a difference [laughter]
sw4771A-ms98-a-0008 65.917500 73.079500 as far as pollution goes i mean you couldn't really see that much [laughter] every once in a while we have these air inversions the weather
sw4771A-ms98-a-0009 73.079500 79.977625 inversions and then it gets hazy around here but they're really we don't have a big problem with it
sw4771A-ms98-a-0010 79.977625 92.811250 i think that uh what most of the people here in New York state are going after right now is it's it's the uh ongoing acid rain problem especially out in the uh uh Adirondack areas
sw4771A-ms98-a-0011 92.811250 101.821625 where you know the lakes are becoming uh changing the acidity of the lakes and we're having problems now because the fish are dying and certain acidic loving plants
sw4771A-ms98-a-0012 101.821625 109.838750 uh or alkaline liking plants are j[ust]- not lasting anymore because the soil levels the p H is changing
sw4771A-ms98-a-0013 109.838750 115.449500 as this acid rain continues to fall and i know that there's been battles over the states up here
sw4771A-ms98-a-0014 115.449500 121.821125 uh you know Governor Mario going after you know governors of Ohio and and Indiana to fix
sw4771A-ms98-a-0015 121.821125 131.704625 what's going on down there i remember when i was in Florida the only problem was that it seemed like it may it wasn't really pollution just the steamy weather [laughter]
sw4771A-ms98-a-0016 131.704625 138.405375 [silence]
sw4771A-ms98-a-0017 138.405375 139.897250 yeah it
sw4771A-ms98-a-0018 139.897250 157.961875 [silence]
sw4771A-ms98-a-0019 157.961875 165.386375 oh yeah i you know i was in Boston once and i remembered seeing some of these things coming through at rush hour even with the tee
sw4771A-ms98-a-0020 165.386375 170.096625 um just this it looked like billions of cars massing
sw4771A-ms98-a-0021 170.096625 177.555625 and if they sit there and then there's nowhere for the air to go i mean yeah that's what's in you know Los Angeles is i think that's biggest problem
sw4771A-ms98-a-0022 177.555625 185.142500 because when i was in Los Angeles for a time it's all you know from Los Angeles to San Diego it's like all city
sw4771A-ms98-a-0023 185.142500 186.425125 [silence]
sw4771A-ms98-a-0024 186.425125 190.799750 and there's really there's nowhere for this to be absorbed really
sw4771A-ms98-a-0025 190.799750 199.994875 um tree planting sometimes can handle you know stopping some of the air pollution and that and help but if you have nowhere to do anything
sw4771A-ms98-a-0026 199.994875 201.963750 [silence]
sw4771A-ms98-a-0027 201.963750 203.282125 [noise]
sw4771A-ms98-a-0028 203.282125 221.409875 [silence]
sw4771A-ms98-a-0029 221.409875 227.369500 yeah i you know Florida doesn't seem to be at least maybe Miami
sw4771A-ms98-a-0030 227.369500 233.759750 but i i uh you know Fort Lauderdale i i don't know what the big industries are down there
sw4771A-ms98-a-0031 233.759750 240.273375 uh but you know up here we have Kodak and that's the worst polluter they put uh
sw4771A-ms98-a-0032 240.273375 244.151750 uh you can smell ether in the air sometimes [laughter]
sw4771A-ms98-a-0033 244.151750 246.434500 keeps the neighborhoods happy i guess
sw4771A-ms98-a-0034 246.434500 249.299000 uh cause they clean the uh
sw4771A-ms98-a-0035 249.299000 260.440000 the lenses for cameras and they they make film here and they're the worst offender but it's you know it's under so much control you know sulphur dioxide is the big
sw4771A-ms98-a-0036 260.440000 264.485375 emittant from them but that's really getting under control now
sw4771A-ms98-a-0037 264.485375 284.728500 [silence]
sw4771A-ms98-a-0038 284.728500 285.771500 yeah
sw4771A-ms98-a-0039 285.771500 294.161250 [silence]
sw4771A-ms98-a-0040 294.161250 299.458000 be interesting to see when as Mexico develops industrially whether you know without
