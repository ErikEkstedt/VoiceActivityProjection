sw4796B-ms98-a-0002 1.039125 4.593250 [silence]
sw4796B-ms98-a-0003 4.593250 13.631875 oh yeah [vocalized-noise] ever since i was a young and uh used to watch the old uh Apollo missions going off in uh classroom TVs
sw4796B-ms98-a-0004 13.631875 23.776625 uh i suspect a lot of people uh uh got uh turned on by watching watching those go off uh very exciting
sw4796B-ms98-a-0005 23.776625 25.200500 the uh
sw4796B-ms98-a-0006 25.200500 35.645125 uh i've al[ways]- i've always uh w[anted]- wanted very much uh to uh be somehow involved in all that
sw4796B-ms98-a-0007 35.645125 44.446125 and uh to uh meet and and to see see it actually happen of course i've really wanted to actually manage to get into space someday
sw4796B-ms98-a-0008 44.446125 48.137875 but uh that seems rather unlikely at this point unfortunately
sw4796B-ms98-a-0009 48.137875 49.168500 [silence]
sw4796B-ms98-a-0010 49.168500 50.904875 uh computer programmer
sw4796B-ms98-a-0011 50.904875 51.384375 [laughter]
sw4796B-ms98-a-0012 51.384375 54.338125 unfortunately that can be done from the ground [laughter]
sw4796B-ms98-a-0013 54.338125 55.774500 [silence]
sw4796B-ms98-a-0014 55.774500 60.828000 yeah made the wrong wrong career choice to get up into [laughter-space]
sw4796B-ms98-a-0015 60.828000 61.669500 [noise]
sw4796B-ms98-a-0016 61.669500 63.112375 the uh
sw4796B-ms98-a-0017 63.112375 64.654750 uh
sw4796B-ms98-a-0018 64.654750 72.249625 i used to think when i was when i was younger that uh by this time we'd have lots more in stuff in space than we do now
sw4796B-ms98-a-0019 72.249625 73.254125 uh
sw4796B-ms98-a-0020 73.254125 75.167250 frustrating at times
sw4796B-ms98-a-0021 75.167250 78.313000 i don't know what you think [laughter] about all that
sw4796B-ms98-a-0022 78.313000 98.375000 [silence]
sw4796B-ms98-a-0023 98.375000 99.637000 uh-huh
sw4796B-ms98-a-0024 99.637000 128.313500 [silence]
sw4796B-ms98-a-0025 128.313500 129.390625 yeah
sw4796B-ms98-a-0026 129.390625 130.467750 well
sw4796B-ms98-a-0027 130.467750 133.376750 [silence]
sw4796B-ms98-a-0028 133.376750 136.629375 yeah well the uh
sw4796B-ms98-a-0029 136.629375 138.273875 uh
sw4796B-ms98-a-0030 138.273875 151.716125 i've always uh felt that uh uh one of the long term solutions that at least a few of our problems would be to have uh some sort of uh solar power satellites up
sw4796B-ms98-a-0031 151.716125 165.818375 uh because that's a uh you know in singularly renewable resource that doesn't do it that doesn't require uh uh any particularly uh nasty environmental impact
sw4796B-ms98-a-0032 165.818375 170.968250 and you can just get as much power as you need up there it's a matter of how big you build it
sw4796B-ms98-a-0033 170.968250 182.590625 uh and of course the side effects of this is that you have to have uh lunar mining bases and space stations and easy transport into space and no [vocalized-noise] things that i think we should be doing
sw4796B-ms98-a-0034 182.590625 193.673500 so the side effects of doing that which i think would be good y[ou]- know very very good for all for everyone in the long run is uh is it some of the other things i'd like to see happen would happen also
sw4796B-ms98-a-0035 193.673500 194.902750 so
sw4796B-ms98-a-0036 194.902750 196.515125 i'm
sw4796B-ms98-a-0037 196.515125 200.898750 yeah right right um
sw4796B-ms98-a-0038 200.898750 211.337625 right the only problem is of course that uh that requires significant commitment from people to actually decide they want to put things like that up there
sw4796B-ms98-a-0039 211.337625 216.349000 and they want to do the research and uh they're all [noise]
sw4796B-ms98-a-0040 216.349000 227.840750 you know n[o]- no one the only commitments that they're interested in making or even talking about are ones for flash value like uh the trip to Mars
sw4796B-ms98-a-0041 227.840750 233.442250 which is would would would produce some useful scientific research and so forth but
sw4796B-ms98-a-0042 233.442250 233.817375 [noise]
sw4796B-ms98-a-0043 233.817375 244.399000 the same money could probably be far better spent on uh uh lunar bases and solar power satellite research an[d]- and uh and uh so forth 
sw4796B-ms98-a-0044 244.399000 250.010375 it it would be do[ne]- it would be being done for the uh glitz and show factor 
sw4796B-ms98-a-0045 250.010375 259.434750 to get politician's votes instead of instead of f[or]- for you know we should eventually send someone people to Mars but not just because it's glitzy to do so
sw4796B-ms98-a-0046 259.434750 265.264375 we should do it because [vocalized-noise] for the for the return we get for it and uh
sw4796B-ms98-a-0047 265.264375 269.163750 uh unfortunately that's not why things [laughter-happen] [laughter]
sw4796B-ms98-a-0048 269.163750 277.160250 i- i would settle for the glit[z]- [vocalized-noise] for the glitz if the side effects were useful if they oh but uh 
sw4796B-ms98-a-0049 277.160250 281.782500 the downside of that is that you after you do one of those people say well we did it
sw4796B-ms98-a-0050 281.782500 284.090125 now let's now we're done [laughter]
sw4796B-ms98-a-0051 284.090125 288.735125 no need to use this anymo[re]- to play around with this space stuff anymore that's what happened with Apollo
sw4796B-ms98-a-0052 288.735125 290.390125 uh
sw4796B-ms98-a-0053 290.390125 292.539750 but uh
sw4796B-ms98-a-0054 292.539750 295.899375 i'd give almost anything to get into space [laughter]
sw4796B-ms98-a-0055 295.899375 300.482000 [silence]
