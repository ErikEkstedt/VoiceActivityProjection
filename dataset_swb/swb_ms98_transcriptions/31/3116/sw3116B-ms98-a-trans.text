sw3116B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 8.866375 okay talk about uh what kind of restaurants we we like to go to and what uh makes us go back and i'll start talking about it so
sw3116B-ms98-a-0002 8.866375 20.034500 usually i just kind of like uh places that are family style kind of things because_1 it's a a casual atmosphere and you usually get good portions of food and stuff and and uh
sw3116B-ms98-a-0003 20.034500 31.092750 [noise] but [vocalized-noise] we were in California recently and i went we went to a couple of very uh i guess expensive extravagant restaurants because_1 it was kind of the thing to do and we just wanted to see what it was like
sw3116B-ms98-a-0004 31.092750 38.004250 and we got to get some real good food more exotic and uh we thought that the service was very good
sw3116B-ms98-a-0005 38.004250 45.812500 and uh that kind of makes me want to go to those places again even though it is expensive you know like maybe once a year or once every six months go to it or something like that
sw3116B-ms98-a-0006 45.812500 47.250750 but how about you

sw3116B-ms98-a-0023 129.489625 137.078625 um-hum you know what we have around here too is uh a place where you uh you pick your own meat and you cook it yourself
sw3116B-ms98-a-0024 137.078625 144.469500 yeah and they they have everything else cooked you know but baked potatoes and all that but you you pick your meat and you know whether it's marinated or or just regular
sw3116B-ms98-a-0025 144.469500 151.038625 and uh then they have a big grill and you grill it yourself you know and then have all the stuff to put on it you know like if you want to
sw3116B-ms98-a-0026 151.038625 155.125750 i don't know butter on it or whatever or garlic and stuff like that
sw3116B-ms98-a-0027 155.125750 158.216750 you can you can do it that's kind of interesting it was really good
sw3116B-ms98-a-0028 158.216750 159.899125 [silence]
sw3116B-ms98-a-0029 159.899125 166.943125 yeah we we thought that was that wasn't too bad but most of the time you know i was really surprised like i say going at these
sw3116B-ms98-a-0030 166.943125 178.036125 fancier restaurants and and i thought uh i really liked the food you know it uh it was different because_1 you know you see all these things like you see all these chef's chef's shows and stuff like that 
sw3116B-ms98-a-0031 178.036125 185.152500 and uh and you know i always watched and thought well i wonder if that's any good you know it looks kind of [laughter-small] but actually it wasn't bad at all
sw3116B-ms98-a-0032 185.152500 193.299500 you know when they have like seafood dishes uh but it's just kind of kind of sparse with different things put in it that that really uh
sw3116B-ms98-a-0033 193.299500 197.010125 that really taste pretty good you didn't you wouldn't think it goes together you know
sw3116B-ms98-a-0034 197.010125 203.599375 but uh but mostly around here now we just kind of just do family family type of things you know
sw3116B-ms98-a-0035 203.599375 206.850875 because_1 it's uh it's easier to go with two kids two young kids now [laughter]
sw3116B-ms98-a-0036 206.850875 208.170125 [silence]
sw3116B-ms98-a-0037 208.170125 209.423375 yeah
sw3116B-ms98-a-0038 209.423375 218.162875 [silence]

sw3116B-ms98-a-0040 219.942375 221.515000 yeah that's true
sw3116B-ms98-a-0041 221.515000 223.077000 [silence]
sw3116B-ms98-a-0042 223.077000 227.253000 well i think uh some of the things that i liked were uh
sw3116B-ms98-a-0043 227.253000 239.289625 uh well i would see the food and whether or not it tastes good uh the service if they're you know courteous or if they just kind of are hasty you know if they just get your order and go and you never see them_1 again or they coming t[alk]- you know talk with you a little bit or something
sw3116B-ms98-a-0044 239.289625 244.363500 [silence]
sw3116B-ms98-a-0045 244.363500 246.268000 [laughter]
sw3116B-ms98-a-0046 246.268000 249.309500 yes i have we have we have noticed that
sw3116B-ms98-a-0047 249.309500 256.895375 yes so uh you know if they more you you can tell when they're oriented towards kids now if they bring something for them to play with or to write with something you know
sw3116B-ms98-a-0048 256.895375 259.495000 to occupy them_1 you can really tell
sw3116B-ms98-a-0049 259.495000 268.175500 the other thing i've liked too is uh now this isn't you don't have this at at family restaurants but uh is some type of a like a a pianist or something
sw3116B-ms98-a-0050 268.175500 272.718875 that will play some music while your eating and stuff and that was that that was kind of neat
sw3116B-ms98-a-0051 272.718875 274.546875 [silence]
sw3116B-ms98-a-0052 274.546875 275.739750 uh-huh
sw3116B-ms98-a-0053 275.739750 288.314000 [silence]

sw3116B-ms98-a-0055 289.529750 294.858000 [silence]
sw3116B-ms98-a-0056 294.858000 300.782875 there was two places that we went to one in San Francisco and one in uh in Monterey California
sw3116B-ms98-a-0057 300.782875 310.664000 and uh the one in San Francisco is the top of one of the downtown big skyscraper buildings and it was really neat because you c[ould]- had a great view you know of San Francisco and everything
sw3116B-ms98-a-0058 310.664000 318.001875 and uh and that's another thing that would bring me back to a restaurant is the view and the one in in Monterey was really nice because_1 it was overlooking the water too
sw3116B-ms98-a-0059 318.001875 320.880250 so that was that was a couple things that we liked
sw3116B-ms98-a-0060 320.880250 322.327500 but
