sw3116A-ms98-a-0002 45.027625 46.424125 um-hum
sw3116A-ms98-a-0003 46.424125 53.513625 [noise] yeah i- i enjoy going out but my husband goes out for dinner a lot with his company you know with his work
sw3116A-ms98-a-0004 53.513625 60.656750 so it's something that i end up kind of experimenting with with my girlfriends or maybe taking my girls out when he's gone and
sw3116A-ms98-a-0005 60.656750 68.361125 and so we end up usually finding something that's uh quick service and uh that's hopefully economical and uh
sw3116A-ms98-a-0006 68.361125 75.079500 certainly tastes good i hate to uh pay any kind of an amount and then have the food be real mediocre
sw3116A-ms98-a-0007 75.079500 81.512375 um [noise] as far as to really go out for an evening though i do like to have a place that's
sw3116A-ms98-a-0008 81.512375 91.242000 not real real formal but kind of on a formal side just because usually their atmosphere is more on a quiet atmosphere and it's real relaxing and then
sw3116A-ms98-a-0009 91.242000 97.821000 uh the quality of food is usually kind of is affected by how the mood is set so
sw3116A-ms98-a-0010 97.821000 105.200625 um i guess my favorite kind of f[oods]- foods would be uh the ones that
sw3116A-ms98-a-0011 105.200625 110.841000 [noise] well i don't know favorite is just going out for a good good hearty steak but
sw3116A-ms98-a-0012 110.841000 120.676250 i- i- i find it amazing around here we don't have too many good steak houses it doesn't seem and i- i find that amazing being in Texas i'm from another state originally and
sw3116A-ms98-a-0013 120.676250 124.493250 i always thought Texas was supposed to be such a good meat state
sw3116A-ms98-a-0014 124.493250 130.494625 and it seems to be a tough thing to do is to find a place that cooks up a real good juicy steak so
sw3116A-ms98-a-0015 130.494625 136.508875 [silence]
sw3116A-ms98-a-0016 136.508875 138.045250 oh really

sw3116A-ms98-a-0035 206.615125 214.149500 yeah that's what we have too yeah and yeah you do have to kind of decide well are we there to get a good meal and and just
sw3116A-ms98-a-0036 214.149500 220.400375 be comfortable as a family or are we looking to spend a lot of time and a lot of money which doesn't work with kids
sw3116A-ms98-a-0037 220.400375 224.147125 so what would make you go back to a good restaurant

sw3116A-ms98-a-0044 247.441250 248.878500 yeah

sw3116A-ms98-a-0055 290.792125 295.668125 just within your own little group so it makes for a nice nice place to go
