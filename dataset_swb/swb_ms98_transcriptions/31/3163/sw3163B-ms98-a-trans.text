sw3163B-ms98-a-0009 49.897250 60.722375 well i- i was thinking too in terms of of in terms of this you know the education is so different i think women are so much better educated now than they used to be and i think that makes a big impact on what women do
sw3163B-ms98-a-0010 60.722375 70.495000 um also i was thinking the the clothing has changed so dramatically uh you know y[ou]- like when you said with sports i thought well it was so limiting because of their clothes
sw3163B-ms98-a-0011 70.495000 81.021500 they weren't allowed to to wear certain things and so then they couldn't par[ticipate]- you know they couldn't participate in sports because of it so um i thought that's that's made a difference uh
sw3163B-ms98-a-0012 81.021500 85.293250 [silence]
sw3163B-ms98-a-0013 85.293250 86.745750 um-hum

sw3163B-ms98-a-0018 93.868750 95.280625 yeah
sw3163B-ms98-a-0019 95.280625 98.850750 [silence]
sw3163B-ms98-a-0020 98.850750 105.212250 well i think so or spend part of their lives doing one thing and part of their lives doing another you know it
sw3163B-ms98-a-0021 105.212250 117.523500 yeah uh be[cause]- you know because really it isn't that long a period of time that you have to be home with children uh comparatively speaking if you look look through your whole look at your whole life um
sw3163B-ms98-a-0022 117.523500 123.056125 and i do think there's real value in being in the home uh i do sort of both but um
sw3163B-ms98-a-0023 123.056125 135.541375 you know it it is it's an interesting topic i the thing that's been hard for me to believe too is that how l[ong]- how short a time it's been since the women had the vote and that's always been amazing to me
sw3163B-ms98-a-0024 135.541375 144.750125 that that's been a [laughter-relatively] short period of time and i think that made a major impact on women's roles uh you know from that point on
sw3163B-ms98-a-0025 144.750125 146.654250 [silence]
sw3163B-ms98-a-0026 146.654250 148.806875 i [laughter]

sw3163B-ms98-a-0029 159.337250 163.864875 [silence]
sw3163B-ms98-a-0030 163.864875 175.689625 well and it will be fascinating to see within the next twenty to thirty years how that changes even more i think the impact will be felt more and more as as better educated women come into the work force
sw3163B-ms98-a-0031 175.689625 179.581875 um and more and more women come into the work force um
sw3163B-ms98-a-0032 179.581875 184.516875 i you know it it's going to just change things drastically i think

sw3163B-ms98-a-0036 196.666375 208.351250 [noise] well i think that you know that one of the things that may come out of this is to let people do what they're best at you know some people uh may men may stay home with children better than some women may and so whoever
sw3163B-ms98-a-0037 208.351250 212.289625 you know whoever does which role best i think should do it [noise] um
sw3163B-ms98-a-0038 212.289625 215.530250 if if people can compromise and do that kind of thing
sw3163B-ms98-a-0039 215.530250 217.773250 tha[t]- that takes a lot [laughter-of]
