sw3158A-ms98-a-0037 143.482625 145.623500 well i was gonna say because_1
sw3158A-ms98-a-0038 145.623500 151.236000 because_1 if you could knit you could crochet it's just like doing one handed as long as you learn how to
sw3158A-ms98-a-0039 151.236000 156.365000 to to weave the the yarn in between your fingers on your left hand
sw3158A-ms98-a-0040 156.365000 158.996125 and then you just use your right hand with the hook
sw3158A-ms98-a-0041 158.996125 168.949500 and that's not it's really not too difficult you could learn that i'm sure and pick that up if you i think if you can do any handicraft you can learn to crochet it's not too difficult
sw3158A-ms98-a-0042 168.949500 173.392250 [silence]
sw3158A-ms98-a-0043 173.392250 174.817375 yeah

sw3158A-ms98-a-0048 190.817375 199.399125 huh and yet you know i think about you know you said you do a lot of needlework and and there are some beautiful just gorgeous patterns
sw3158A-ms98-a-0049 199.399125 201.261250 that people do
sw3158A-ms98-a-0050 201.261250 203.866750 and i- i just think that um
sw3158A-ms98-a-0051 203.866750 207.424250 that's one of one of the arts that i think are real pretty
sw3158A-ms98-a-0052 207.424250 209.867625 and a lot of people don't do that either
sw3158A-ms98-a-0053 209.867625 212.119750 you know and so
