sw3158B-ms98-a-0006 16.716750 26.186000 oh wow that's the next project that i'd like to learn to do i do mostly hand needlework like cross stitch and crewel embroidery
sw3158B-ms98-a-0007 26.186000 32.612250 and i'm i'm beginning to get a little bored with cross stitch and was thinking maybe need to learn to quilt

sw3158B-ms98-a-0012 44.697875 50.176875 well it just reaches a point where it doesn't seem to be very challenging i think
sw3158B-ms98-a-0013 50.176875 57.535125 but i do a a lot of it in the car we yeah we commute from [noise] Plano to Dallas
sw3158B-ms98-a-0014 57.535125 65.695625 so i have nearly an hour both ways that i can really get a lot of work done and i found that cross stitch is the easiest to do in the car
sw3158B-ms98-a-0015 65.695625 68.267625 i don't know that i could even think about quilting
sw3158B-ms98-a-0016 68.267625 72.646750 you have to have a pretty good frame don't you to do any kind of quilting work
sw3158B-ms98-a-0017 72.646750 73.681875 hm

sw3158B-ms98-a-0031 115.502875 125.329750 there's so many things i wish i had learned to do with my mother she had crocheted a full bedspread it's kind of a hobnail looking thing
sw3158B-ms98-a-0032 125.329750 138.390125 and when i look at it now she's been dead for a long time i think oh why didn't i learn these crafts and skills from her because she could crochet and do so many of the old things that aren't in vogue right now that
sw3158B-ms98-a-0033 138.390125 140.314375 people just don't know how to do

sw3158B-ms98-a-0046 168.084375 173.730750 it's funny when you were talking about sewing i love to do anything by hand with a needle
sw3158B-ms98-a-0047 173.730750 178.679500 but i'm totally intimidated if i sit down at a sewing machine i never learned
sw3158B-ms98-a-0048 178.679500 188.829500 and i get real nervous whereas usually the other needlework stuff is relaxing to me but i just have a phobia about not being able to actually sew

sw3158B-ms98-a-0056 212.813125 220.216500 i- i wouldn't if i didn't have this car time ability probably because at night if i sit down i'm doing something with the kids or

sw3158B-ms98-a-0062 242.963750 250.290375 to watch TV and then taking them_1 off to do needlework and i get frustrated doing that [laughter-so] just give it up
