sw3119B-ms98-a-0009 41.350000 42.500625 [silence]
sw3119B-ms98-a-0010 42.500625 44.390500 yes i know
sw3119B-ms98-a-0011 44.390500 51.180500 [silence]

sw3119B-ms98-a-0013 52.442625 55.665750 [silence]
sw3119B-ms98-a-0014 55.665750 56.669875 yeah
sw3119B-ms98-a-0015 56.669875 58.767000 [silence]
sw3119B-ms98-a-0016 58.767000 68.620000 yeah my husband is a landscaper and so they all bought the rec[ycled]- or the mulching mowers so that they don't they don't bag anything anymore
sw3119B-ms98-a-0017 68.620000 75.243000 so it was i i know it cut down on his work load [laughter-but] it's also being helpful [laughter]
sw3119B-ms98-a-0018 75.243000 79.071250 [silence]
sw3119B-ms98-a-0019 79.071250 85.334125 yeah it vacuums it up and back up into the air several times and chops it up so fine that
sw3119B-ms98-a-0020 85.334125 93.600000 you know it r[eally]- it really is what from what i understand helpful to the grass and then plus you don't have the big bags of of grass every time
sw3119B-ms98-a-0021 93.600000 94.769750 [silence]
sw3119B-ms98-a-0022 94.769750 96.972625 yeah yeah so
sw3119B-ms98-a-0023 96.972625 99.155125 [silence]
sw3119B-ms98-a-0024 99.155125 105.329125 yeah we have plast[ic]- at this center we have plastic glass aluminum and newspapers
sw3119B-ms98-a-0025 105.329125 116.291500 but uh the i noticed going to work the other day there's a warehouse or paper company and they buy like your office paper that you've used
sw3119B-ms98-a-0026 116.291500 118.630000 [silence]
sw3119B-ms98-a-0027 118.630000 127.372625 yeah and so i've started that in my office but it's kind of it's not as convenient because they want you to have a certain amount before you'll take it to them_1
sw3119B-ms98-a-0028 127.372625 135.010000 and i don't really care if i get paid for it i just don't want it [laughter] you know i just want it out of my office and i don't want to waste it
sw3119B-ms98-a-0029 135.010000 143.747000 but i was reading in a magazine the other day and i hadn't even thought about doing this that um a lady m[ainly]- mainly for cost cutting reasons
sw3119B-ms98-a-0030 143.747000 152.380000 has m[emo]- sent out a memo to everybody in her company that says if you're sending out interoffice memos it's got to be on the backside of a paper that's already been used
sw3119B-ms98-a-0031 152.380000 157.772000 yeah and i hadn't thought about that [laughter-so] i'm going to make everybody start doing that they think i'm nuts [laughter]
sw3119B-ms98-a-0032 157.772000 159.740000 [silence]
sw3119B-ms98-a-0033 159.740000 166.197500 well i know i mean i showed them_1 the brochure that the city sent out that you know explained how many if you
sw3119B-ms98-a-0034 166.197500 172.797625 recycle this many cans this much power's saved and all this stuff so i think they're beginning to get a little more aware of it but
sw3119B-ms98-a-0035 172.797625 177.722875 oh they all they laughed at me and brought me Greenpeace stickers and [laughter]
sw3119B-ms98-a-0036 177.722875 180.177875 [silence]
sw3119B-ms98-a-0037 180.177875 181.315250 yeah
sw3119B-ms98-a-0038 181.315250 189.120000 [silence]
sw3119B-ms98-a-0039 189.120000 190.659875 oh
sw3119B-ms98-a-0040 190.659875 201.103250 [silence]
sw3119B-ms98-a-0041 201.103250 202.247625 yeah
sw3119B-ms98-a-0042 202.247625 205.840125 [silence]
sw3119B-ms98-a-0043 205.840125 206.902125 it really is
sw3119B-ms98-a-0044 206.902125 207.632750 [silence]
sw3119B-ms98-a-0045 207.632750 215.590000 i've gotten my husband kind of trained now because_1 it's real funny because_1 i would pull a jar out and rinse it out to put in the glass and he'd throw it away
sw3119B-ms98-a-0046 215.590000 223.322125 [laughter-and] [laughter-i'd] [laughter-say] you know i had that out for a reason [laughter] but he's learning now too so it's just kind of difficult
sw3119B-ms98-a-0047 223.322125 234.870000 but you know i don't i don't have any kids yet and that's what they kept stressing in a lot of the brochures is if your kids are going to you know be able to survive at all without having mounds of trash around them_1 everybody's got to start doing this
sw3119B-ms98-a-0048 234.870000 242.606625 [silence]
sw3119B-ms98-a-0049 242.606625 244.001750 oh that's good
sw3119B-ms98-a-0050 244.001750 251.674250 [silence]
sw3119B-ms98-a-0051 251.674250 252.726875 well that's neat
sw3119B-ms98-a-0052 252.726875 256.370000 [silence]
sw3119B-ms98-a-0053 256.370000 257.497250 yeah [laughter]
sw3119B-ms98-a-0054 257.497250 264.495250 [silence]
sw3119B-ms98-a-0055 264.495250 265.459500 huh
sw3119B-ms98-a-0056 265.459500 267.650000 [silence]
sw3119B-ms98-a-0057 267.650000 274.210125 yeah well i'm anxious to get it little more implemented into my office i've got the aluminum cans out and i've got the
sw3119B-ms98-a-0058 274.210125 280.276250 newspapers where e[verybody's]- everybody's pretty much aware of that because_1 they get yelled at if they throw their uh
sw3119B-ms98-a-0059 280.276250 286.825625 but now what i'm going to do with this recycled office paper is uh just get separate trash cans and
sw3119B-ms98-a-0060 286.825625 295.530000 tell them to put their trash in this one and the paper that can be recycled in that one and hopefully [laughter-hopefully] they'll go along with it [laughter]
sw3119B-ms98-a-0061 295.530000 296.956125 so
sw3119B-ms98-a-0062 296.956125 298.318500 [silence]
sw3119B-ms98-a-0063 298.318500 299.602250 yeah
sw3119B-ms98-a-0064 299.602250 310.920000 so i i don't know we'll see but um that lady said she was real surprised that she did get a lot of protest at first but she said it's cut down on their office expenses a lot and
sw3119B-ms98-a-0065 310.920000 315.043875 it's just recycling so anyway we'll see
sw3119B-ms98-a-0066 315.043875 316.140000 [silence]
sw3119B-ms98-a-0067 316.140000 325.516250 yeah but i mean i guess there's only so much they can do as far as re[cycle]- as advanced stuff now but something else that i'd really like to get into more and i haven't is
sw3119B-ms98-a-0068 325.516250 330.760000 the like the Downy softener products and stuff that you just buy the concentrate
sw3119B-ms98-a-0069 330.760000 331.460000 [silence]
sw3119B-ms98-a-0070 331.460000 333.121750 i wish they'd get more into that
sw3119B-ms98-a-0071 333.121750 334.349500 [silence]
sw3119B-ms98-a-0072 334.349500 338.047500 yeah and even just the companies coming out with more things like that
sw3119B-ms98-a-0073 338.047500 339.067500 [silence]
sw3119B-ms98-a-0074 339.067500 347.031875 so i don't know i- i know a lot of companies are real dedicated to it i just got a brochure from my insurance company the other day and
sw3119B-ms98-a-0075 347.031875 357.577500 the whole thing was made on recycled paper and then something i hadn't heard of is they the ink was produced with [vocalized-noise] with uh soy based oils instead of
sw3119B-ms98-a-0076 357.577500 364.100500 p[etroleum]- instead of petroleum because_1 they said it was less toxic and i had never heard of that [laughter]
sw3119B-ms98-a-0077 364.100500 370.240000 but i mean they made a big deal to let everybody know that whole brochure was recycled and can be recycled again
sw3119B-ms98-a-0078 370.240000 371.420000 [silence]
sw3119B-ms98-a-0079 371.420000 372.770750 yeah it really was
sw3119B-ms98-a-0080 372.770750 374.888375 [silence]
sw3119B-ms98-a-0081 374.888375 375.894750 oh yeah
sw3119B-ms98-a-0082 375.894750 384.155625 [silence]
sw3119B-ms98-a-0083 384.155625 385.476000 yeah
sw3119B-ms98-a-0084 385.476000 393.940000 [silence]
sw3119B-ms98-a-0085 393.940000 395.856500 oh my gosh
sw3119B-ms98-a-0086 395.856500 400.637875 [silence]
sw3119B-ms98-a-0087 400.637875 401.660875 yeah
sw3119B-ms98-a-0088 401.660875 405.059750 [silence]
sw3119B-ms98-a-0089 405.059750 406.192625 wow
sw3119B-ms98-a-0090 406.192625 414.946000 [silence]
sw3119B-ms98-a-0091 414.946000 416.261375 yeah
sw3119B-ms98-a-0092 416.261375 418.042875 [silence]
sw3119B-ms98-a-0093 418.042875 419.320000 oh
sw3119B-ms98-a-0094 419.320000 420.723625 well
sw3119B-ms98-a-0095 420.723625 424.460625 one of my girlfriends recently had a baby and she goes about half and half
sw3119B-ms98-a-0096 424.460625 428.820000 she uses the cloth diapers at home but she said when you're traveling it's just almost impossible
sw3119B-ms98-a-0097 428.820000 429.627625 [silence]
sw3119B-ms98-a-0098 429.627625 434.810750 so she says she feels like she's doing her part some because she's not using them_1 all the time
sw3119B-ms98-a-0099 434.810750 442.185125 but yeah that's something i kind of been thinking about because_1 we haven't had children yet and i thought oh God [laughter]
sw3119B-ms98-a-0100 442.185125 449.047375 [silence]
sw3119B-ms98-a-0101 449.047375 450.349375 [laughter]
