sw3119A-ms98-a-0092 374.826500 375.680000 [silence]
sw3119A-ms98-a-0093 375.680000 384.482000 um and i i guess some companies are beginning to do some things uh to where part of the diaper can be recycled or degraded
sw3119A-ms98-a-0094 384.482000 394.239250 um but we did an interesting thing in my classroom um calculating the number of uh diapers that were used for my class of kids just
sw3119A-ms98-a-0095 394.239250 400.960000 in the time that they would have been the age to wear diapers and uh the kids were just astounded
sw3119A-ms98-a-0096 400.960000 405.590500 and then we calculated a[ccording]- according to the number of kids in the school and that kind of thing and
sw3119A-ms98-a-0097 405.590500 413.177000 so that you know that's a real eye-opening um activity to do because you you begin to think of the
sw3119A-ms98-a-0098 413.177000 420.872375 [laughter-thousands] and [laughter-millions] and billions of diapers that are [laughter-still] there oh it's that's incredible
