sw3149A-ms98-a-0003 2.274500 15.773125 all right well i guess you know i- i wasn't expecting that question about AIDS so i haven't thought too much about it but i guess i think that we should have more research um i'm just concerned that it's just going to be such a major health problem
sw3149A-ms98-a-0004 15.773125 21.989500 and if we you know and if it's not i say it would seem to me the sooner we take care of it the better off we're going to be
sw3149A-ms98-a-0005 21.989500 23.857375 [silence]
sw3149A-ms98-a-0006 23.857375 34.953875 well that's what i think and it's going to start affecting all of the population you know i mean right now yeah you know and it's just going to become such a huge issue
sw3149A-ms98-a-0007 34.953875 41.416250 and it's just so scary that there's just not much that can be done at this point so i guess

sw3149A-ms98-a-0019 81.436125 89.062625 and uh so and those have just you know it's just been real hard and i just hate seeing people you know go through this
sw3149A-ms98-a-0020 89.062625 102.095125 so and i keep thinking it's going to hit our church eventually you know it's like uh i[t's]- it's real interesting to me that we've not had anybody yet but you know it's going to just start affecting i think everyone

sw3149A-ms98-a-0023 106.203000 115.160000 it is really scary you know i- i thought of that for myself for like for my children this whole issue of the whole blood issue is very scary
sw3149A-ms98-a-0024 115.160000 121.671000 because you know people don't know that's the thing there's a f[actor]- there's a time factor in there

sw3149A-ms98-a-0031 153.834000 161.806750 uh you know i- i would hate to be in a position where i would need a transfusion or my children i think it would be a real scary thing
