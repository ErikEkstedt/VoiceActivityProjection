sw3149B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.674250 [noise]
sw3149B-ms98-a-0002 0.674250 3.001250 okay start us
sw3149B-ms98-a-0003 3.001250 15.261750 [silence]
sw3149B-ms98-a-0004 15.261750 16.699625 yeah
sw3149B-ms98-a-0005 16.699625 21.064750 [silence]
sw3149B-ms98-a-0006 21.064750 24.963500 right because it's just getting worse and worse and worse and worse
sw3149B-ms98-a-0007 24.963500 26.116125 ye[ah]-
sw3149B-ms98-a-0008 26.116125 27.927125 [silence]
sw3149B-ms98-a-0009 27.927125 29.240625 yeah
sw3149B-ms98-a-0010 29.240625 31.165625 it already has
sw3149B-ms98-a-0011 31.165625 39.015000 [silence]
sw3149B-ms98-a-0012 39.015000 52.252000 right although they are doing a whole lot more than they were five years ago you know they're living longer and and their medicines are a whole lot better so they're not having to go through as many of the as of the other diseases
sw3149B-ms98-a-0013 52.252000 65.731125 or so it sounds anyway as you know when when all of this first started out they they came down with every single disease that came down the pipe because they had no immune system and they suffered so much worse
sw3149B-ms98-a-0014 65.731125 72.516250 so you know at at least they're making progress but they've got to get it stopped they've got to find a cure
sw3149B-ms98-a-0015 72.516250 80.265750 [silence]
sw3149B-ms98-a-0016 80.265750 81.832125 so have i
sw3149B-ms98-a-0017 81.832125 84.542125 [silence]
sw3149B-ms98-a-0018 84.542125 86.009500 yeah
sw3149B-ms98-a-0019 86.009500 93.015125 [silence]
sw3149B-ms98-a-0020 93.015125 95.006250 well yeah
sw3149B-ms98-a-0021 95.006250 101.390375 [silence]
sw3149B-ms98-a-0022 101.390375 104.930250 well especially with you know surgeries all the time
sw3149B-ms98-a-0023 104.930250 106.822250 it's so scary
sw3149B-ms98-a-0024 106.822250 110.779500 [silence]
sw3149B-ms98-a-0025 110.779500 112.430500 uh-huh

sw3149B-ms98-a-0031 120.714750 125.154500 yeah and you know well with the time factor it could be up to ten years
sw3149B-ms98-a-0032 125.154500 134.503000 you know so that's what's so bad and and you may test negative this time but you may test positive you know two weeks down the road
sw3149B-ms98-a-0033 134.503000 136.238250 so
sw3149B-ms98-a-0034 136.238250 142.100125 the test is relevant for that very day but not necessarily forever
sw3149B-ms98-a-0035 142.100125 145.153250 [silence]
sw3149B-ms98-a-0036 145.153250 146.380250 yeah

sw3149B-ms98-a-0040 160.965625 170.483500 yeah a[nd]- and like when i went in the hospital you have to sign a paper saying that that you'll allow them to give blood if they if you need it otherwise they won't do the surgery
sw3149B-ms98-a-0041 170.483500 172.106875 [laughter]
sw3149B-ms98-a-0042 172.106875 183.147750 so what do you do i mean yeah you're given the option of signing or not signing but if you say no i don't want the blood then they they may say well then i'm not going to do the surgery
sw3149B-ms98-a-0043 183.147750 184.797250 [silence]
sw3149B-ms98-a-0044 184.797250 187.583625 right right wha[t]- what can they do
sw3149B-ms98-a-0045 187.583625 200.513875 [silence]
sw3149B-ms98-a-0046 200.513875 206.837000 well y[eah]- that's right and they've got to do something about it they can't put it on the back burner
sw3149B-ms98-a-0047 206.837000 212.892375 and just say well you know the research is going on is doing good enough because it's not there's no cure yet
sw3149B-ms98-a-0048 212.892375 217.408250 [silence]
sw3149B-ms98-a-0049 217.408250 219.737250 you got it

sw3149B-ms98-a-0052 226.598375 229.371125 of course i don't have that problem
sw3149B-ms98-a-0053 229.371125 240.765625 [laughter] i probably will never [laughter-have] [laughter-to] [laughter-worry] [laughter-about] [laughter-that] [laughter] [laughter-oh] gosh what a shame [laughter]

sw3149B-ms98-a-0068 286.216000 296.141250 and then he finally was able to get the what is it AZT over here only because he had connections that was not open to the public at that time
sw3149B-ms98-a-0069 296.141250 297.878500 so
