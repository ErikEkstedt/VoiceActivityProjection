sw3150A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 3.633000 [silence]
sw3150A-ms98-a-0002 3.633000 7.297125 well it's i am pretty much against it [laughter]
sw3150A-ms98-a-0003 7.297125 8.988625 yeah how about you
sw3150A-ms98-a-0004 8.988625 12.382750 oh good [laughter] we can have a debate
sw3150A-ms98-a-0005 12.382750 15.125500 well like um
sw3150A-ms98-a-0006 15.125500 26.687125 i don't know i c[an't]- think that i one of the reasons that i'm against it is that uh um i'm a[fraid]- afraid of someone losing their life for s[omething]- um wrongly
sw3150A-ms98-a-0007 26.687125 38.956875 right and another reason o[ne]- one of the arguments that really i really a[ctually]- actually have been kind of ambivalent about it but one of the arguments that really uh uh made me feel kind of strongly against it is that uh
sw3150A-ms98-a-0008 38.956875 47.771375 you know someone said to me once well imagine i[f]- if the person you love most in the world like your mother or something if someone killed her wouldn't you want to see them killed
sw3150A-ms98-a-0009 47.771375 59.206750 for the punishment but then i thought about it and i thought well the loss that i would feel at losing my mother someone else would feel that about that person no matter how rotten they were somebody loves them [laughter]
sw3150A-ms98-a-0010 59.206750 60.703750 how about you
sw3150A-ms98-a-0011 60.703750 77.722500 [silence]
sw3150A-ms98-a-0012 77.722500 79.593125 yeah that's true
sw3150A-ms98-a-0013 79.593125 88.610125 [silence]
sw3150A-ms98-a-0014 88.610125 89.961375 um-hum
sw3150A-ms98-a-0015 89.961375 106.046375 [silence]
sw3150A-ms98-a-0016 106.046375 114.047250 right well you know that's true because uh m[y]- but a lot of um these [laughter-conversations] i've had on this program this
sw3150A-ms98-a-0017 114.047250 118.012500 these telephone conversations have revolved around um
sw3150A-ms98-a-0018 118.012500 119.334500 criminal
sw3150A-ms98-a-0019 119.334500 131.994500 you know justice or whatever and most of the time i hear myself saying well you know we don't have enough room left in the jails and people crime is still climbing we need to have stiffer punishments you know but i just am scared of [laughter-capital] [laughter-punishment] i guess
sw3150A-ms98-a-0020 131.994500 170.396250 [silence]
sw3150A-ms98-a-0021 170.396250 171.725125 um-hum
sw3150A-ms98-a-0022 171.725125 176.114250 [silence]
sw3150A-ms98-a-0023 176.114250 186.319000 right especially when it's so far removed if it's no one that i know then you have to think about the taxpayers paying the shelter and feed and clothe them for the rest of their life
sw3150A-ms98-a-0024 186.319000 189.231625 letting him out again [laughter]
sw3150A-ms98-a-0025 189.231625 190.236250 [silence]
sw3150A-ms98-a-0026 190.236250 191.528500 um-hum
sw3150A-ms98-a-0027 191.528500 206.789875 [silence]

sw3150A-ms98-a-0029 208.128875 210.595000 [silence]
sw3150A-ms98-a-0030 210.595000 219.685375 that's true you know i just recently moved to Massachusetts i'm not sure what their policy is on capital punishment and that was one of the questions but uh
sw3150A-ms98-a-0031 219.685375 230.235125 i do know that they are notorious for [laughter-paroling] [laughter-people] yeah when they're when and then having them reconvicted for violent crimes
sw3150A-ms98-a-0032 230.235125 239.739250 and i guess they said you know sh[ould]- do you think it should be restricted i guess if it were if if because a lot of states do still practice capital punishment i guess violent crimes would be the
sw3150A-ms98-a-0033 239.739250 247.934750 crimes where i can see it making the most sense you know violent crimes with no uh with just malicious intent
sw3150A-ms98-a-0034 247.934750 272.956375 [silence]
sw3150A-ms98-a-0035 272.956375 274.355875 yeah
sw3150A-ms98-a-0036 274.355875 279.474000 [silence]
sw3150A-ms98-a-0037 279.474000 282.892375 hang [laughter]
sw3150A-ms98-a-0038 282.892375 287.010500 and what is he going to do in prison to the other [laughter-peo[ple]-] [laughter]
sw3150A-ms98-a-0039 287.010500 295.746875 [silence]
sw3150A-ms98-a-0040 295.746875 297.147625 right
sw3150A-ms98-a-0041 297.147625 298.894125 [silence]
sw3150A-ms98-a-0042 298.894125 309.291250 well i was i saw on a human interest story or whatever today there was a woman who was just being paroled and trying to make it back she was off drugs and everything but she said you know
sw3150A-ms98-a-0043 309.291250 319.379250 in prison you can get anything you can get any drugs you want there's you ca[n]- it's just like being outside you know people find ways around and and there's a power structure that you have to bow to and
sw3150A-ms98-a-0044 319.379250 331.888375 and it really isn't for some people tha[t]- who have been there uh for over and over and over it really isn't uh as ba[d]- i mean there it's not that bad of a life as it should be for the punishment aspect
sw3150A-ms98-a-0045 331.888375 336.435625 but the society is turned against punishment and more towards rehabilitation and
sw3150A-ms98-a-0046 336.435625 342.557250 maybe that's why one of the reasons why crime has gone up because it's not so scary anymore
sw3150A-ms98-a-0047 342.557250 363.287500 [silence]
sw3150A-ms98-a-0048 363.287500 366.304875 right and what they're going to be doing when they get [laughter-out]
sw3150A-ms98-a-0049 366.304875 404.761625 [silence]
sw3150A-ms98-a-0050 404.761625 407.772625 handed it to you [laughter]
sw3150A-ms98-a-0051 407.772625 411.297375 [silence]
sw3150A-ms98-a-0052 411.297375 413.133625 oh oh i see
sw3150A-ms98-a-0053 413.133625 415.070250 [silence]
sw3150A-ms98-a-0054 415.070250 417.130625 [laughter]
sw3150A-ms98-a-0055 417.130625 438.774625 [silence]
sw3150A-ms98-a-0056 438.774625 449.400750 well maybe if they could um if they had more money or more more resources to work more on rehabilitation i mean deep down i think every every human
