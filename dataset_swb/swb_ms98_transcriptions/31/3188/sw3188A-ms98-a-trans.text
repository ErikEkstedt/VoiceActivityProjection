sw3188A-ms98-a-0028 119.107250 128.495250 and uh an[d]- the one of the real strict uh restrictions was the fact that she had to have a special kind of paint that was fire proof and lead free and all that other good stuff
sw3188A-ms98-a-0029 128.495250 132.912000 so uh she had that done but uh

sw3188A-ms98-a-0031 143.717000 149.502500 and um what i had to do is just coat this bare wood with a sealer
sw3188A-ms98-a-0032 149.502500 157.806375 and uh i had this big five gallon jug and it was like paint thinner i mean i you know it looked just like it was the viscosity of paint thinner
sw3188A-ms98-a-0033 157.806375 166.849375 but uh you just took a roller and put it on there and uh if you saw that the wood was getting wet you know that was that was all you needed so
sw3188A-ms98-a-0034 166.849375 174.434250 yeah it was it used all of it i guess it was about three hundred yards worth so well i guess it worked out it was pretty easy actually
