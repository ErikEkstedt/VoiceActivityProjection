sw3188B-ms98-a-0002 1.516000 8.570250 yeah this is a great topic for me because_1 i just did my first two painting projects ever it was not not a big deal
sw3188B-ms98-a-0003 8.570250 16.750500 two little deals the first one um i helped someone repaint an apartment and it was [noise] very easy
sw3188B-ms98-a-0004 16.750500 29.941500 yeah and i've never painted anyth[ing]- i always thought it would be so you know you'd have to hire someone if you needed to paint inside your house or something but i know i can do it [noise] and the second one was i bought some toys at a um
sw3188B-ms98-a-0005 29.941500 42.344625 at a craft fair they're unfinished wooden book ends and stuff for a a little girl for Christmas and so i just decided to paint them and that wasn't as easy as painting the [laughter-apartment] [laughter-was]
sw3188B-ms98-a-0006 42.344625 44.779250 [silence]
sw3188B-ms98-a-0007 44.779250 52.155500 well it's uh it that's half the problem right there is that it wasn't it was a oil base so i had to get and when i painted them_1 i
sw3188B-ms98-a-0008 52.155500 65.922750 didn't realize that we didn't have any uh turpentine or paint thinner or anything in the house so i had it had it all over my hands at first i didn't realize you know i had never painted anything so i didn't realize that i needed that i mean i kind of knew in the back of my mind
sw3188B-ms98-a-0009 65.922750 76.622750 well no you can use it on wood but i just had it all over my hands and i went to wash the brushes out and uh wash my hands and you can't wash it off with water you have to get the uh a solution
sw3188B-ms98-a-0010 76.622750 78.556375 and
sw3188B-ms98-a-0011 78.556375 88.881375 yeah i had to drive to the store yeah i had to drive to the store with paper towels all over my hands to go buy some paint thinner and right back and everything like that and then um
sw3188B-ms98-a-0012 88.881375 100.631875 [noise] uh downstairs in the in the apartment i just use[d]- we just used a latex base and so you can drip it on you know if you dripped it on something as long as you wiped it up it was real easy to clean up
sw3188B-ms98-a-0013 100.631875 110.366875 yeah and and it it just like the same with the toys it's just important to look for one that doesn't have lead in it you know it says safe for children and all that
