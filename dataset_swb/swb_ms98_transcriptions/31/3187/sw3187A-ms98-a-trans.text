sw3187A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 4.700125 [noise] how would you feel about sending an elderly family member to a nursing home
sw3187A-ms98-a-0002 4.700125 23.281625 [silence]
sw3187A-ms98-a-0003 23.281625 24.647875 uh-huh
sw3187A-ms98-a-0004 24.647875 40.572250 [silence]
sw3187A-ms98-a-0005 40.572250 41.960250 right
sw3187A-ms98-a-0006 41.960250 46.321750 [silence]
sw3187A-ms98-a-0007 46.321750 51.395250 and what type of recommendations did you have when you decided where to place him
sw3187A-ms98-a-0008 51.395250 70.119250 [silence]
sw3187A-ms98-a-0009 70.119250 72.119250 oh my
sw3187A-ms98-a-0010 72.119250 93.820625 [silence]
sw3187A-ms98-a-0011 93.820625 96.079375 yeah so the convenience
sw3187A-ms98-a-0012 96.079375 97.346500 [silence]
sw3187A-ms98-a-0013 97.346500 98.588125 right
sw3187A-ms98-a-0014 98.588125 99.995125 [silence]
sw3187A-ms98-a-0015 99.995125 110.563125 my grandmother lived with us um until August um and we made the decision to put her in a nursing home she has leukemia
sw3187A-ms98-a-0016 110.563125 119.358875 and her the rest of her family and her regular doctors and everybody she trusted and knew was in Dayton and were several thousand miles away
sw3187A-ms98-a-0017 119.358875 126.220250 so i made the decision to put her in a nursing home and my sister being on the other end found one
sw3187A-ms98-a-0018 126.220250 136.462250 that she could have what was called an independent living facility she had her own little room and didn't have to share it with anyone and could bring in her own chair and TV set so
sw3187A-ms98-a-0019 136.462250 149.337500 yes and that the other major factor is that she needs blood transfusions every week to ten days and would have to be hospitalized a day or two so in this facility they can do it right there from her own room
sw3187A-ms98-a-0020 149.337500 161.687750 so she didn't have to be transported back and forth so she's been there since August the thirteenth and seems to have adjusted pretty well it's not her favorite place to be in she'd much rather be here with me but
sw3187A-ms98-a-0021 161.687750 169.604625 when it got to the point i was spending more time at the hospital with her and i've got little children here who needed me here
sw3187A-ms98-a-0022 169.604625 174.040125 um she needed somebody to watch her twenty four hours a day
sw3187A-ms98-a-0023 174.040125 175.728125 so
sw3187A-ms98-a-0024 175.728125 188.908750 she was falling down and hemorrhaging and you know all kinds of physical problems so it just became too much for me to handle even though i would have liked to have had her stay with her health being what it was she couldn't anymore
sw3187A-ms98-a-0025 188.908750 204.923625 [silence]
sw3187A-ms98-a-0026 204.923625 206.323375 yeah
sw3187A-ms98-a-0027 206.323375 211.121125 [silence]
sw3187A-ms98-a-0028 211.121125 212.446375 uh-huh
sw3187A-ms98-a-0029 212.446375 216.474250 [silence]
sw3187A-ms98-a-0030 216.474250 217.841875 yeah
sw3187A-ms98-a-0031 217.841875 222.484250 [silence]
sw3187A-ms98-a-0032 222.484250 224.131500 oh
sw3187A-ms98-a-0033 224.131500 235.085375 [silence]
sw3187A-ms98-a-0034 235.085375 236.373375 yeah
sw3187A-ms98-a-0035 236.373375 240.636375 [silence]
sw3187A-ms98-a-0036 240.636375 242.246375 yes
sw3187A-ms98-a-0037 242.246375 255.222750 well i think sometimes when people get to be a certain age other people have to kind of help them_1 make decisions it sure wouldn't have been Granny's decision to leave us and go back to a nursing home but she's accepted it real well now
sw3187A-ms98-a-0038 255.222750 256.642125 [noise] so
sw3187A-ms98-a-0039 256.642125 271.979500 [silence]
sw3187A-ms98-a-0040 271.979500 281.458375 well we enjoyed having her here but we feel she's much safer where she is now she still continues to fall but when she does there a nurse is right there to help her
sw3187A-ms98-a-0041 281.458375 287.482750 and i know she's eating the right things and her doctor's right there where he can come in and check on her so
sw3187A-ms98-a-0042 287.482750 295.459500 it became dangerous for us to keep transporting her back and forth in the car because_1 she was so wobbly and needed a walker or a wheel chair
sw3187A-ms98-a-0043 295.459500 298.722000 so i think she'll adjust
