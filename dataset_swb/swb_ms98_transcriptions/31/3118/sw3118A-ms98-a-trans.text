sw3118A-ms98-a-0030 199.481375 211.866750 you know so it it's i- i- i think i think in in the end the judge has the presiding you know um vote i think he can be you know
sw3118A-ms98-a-0031 211.866750 223.585875 i- i don't know if it's the way it is in real life but i've seen it on TV where the juries go one way and the judge to[tally]- totally finds it obnoxious and he completely you know goes the other way
sw3118A-ms98-a-0032 223.585875 230.810125 now i'm not sure if the judge is allowed to do that in everyday life or what
