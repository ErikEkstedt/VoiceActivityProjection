sw3118B-ms98-a-0002 1.979375 4.315000 okay um
sw3118B-ms98-a-0003 4.315000 14.822125 i haven't i don't know that much about the possi[ble]- what the possible [noise] choices could be about reorganizing the trial by jury but
sw3118B-ms98-a-0004 14.822125 21.247125 um i think it works better than many other systems like having a judge decide
sw3118B-ms98-a-0005 21.247125 22.736625 [laughter]
sw3118B-ms98-a-0006 22.736625 30.979375 i can't think of many alternatives that could be more fair than having twelve people decide although it's difficult because they all have to be new unanimous
sw3118B-ms98-a-0007 30.979375 35.344125 [silence]
sw3118B-ms98-a-0008 35.344125 36.972250 [noise]
sw3118B-ms98-a-0009 36.972250 38.272125 i don't
sw3118B-ms98-a-0010 38.272125 46.930375 [silence]
sw3118B-ms98-a-0011 46.930375 57.300125 i don't know i don't know if i feel i don't feel real strongly about that if the um the thing is though i- i didn't think that [vocalized-noise] even if it was a lower conviction i didn't think that you could
sw3118B-ms98-a-0012 57.300125 61.462875 um i didn't think that you really had to have a a jury [laughter]
sw3118B-ms98-a-0013 61.462875 67.631375 unless i guess if you request one you can but i think yeah making it unanimous sometimes might um
sw3118B-ms98-a-0014 67.631375 68.042625 [noise]
sw3118B-ms98-a-0015 68.042625 73.752750 let the only thing it might let more people get off i don't think it would convict [laughter-any] [laughter-more] [laughter-people]
sw3118B-ms98-a-0016 73.752750 78.524625 and we have so many people already you know the jails are already overloaded
sw3118B-ms98-a-0017 78.524625 98.218250 [silence]
sw3118B-ms98-a-0018 98.218250 108.263500 yeah well if it's no but they they what if they never agree doesn't it just um do they have to go back and do a whole new trial or
sw3118B-ms98-a-0019 108.263500 109.759250 [silence]
sw3118B-ms98-a-0020 109.759250 111.255000 agree
sw3118B-ms98-a-0021 111.255000 115.998000 [silence]
sw3118B-ms98-a-0022 115.998000 117.250000 yeah
sw3118B-ms98-a-0023 117.250000 125.490125 [silence]
sw3118B-ms98-a-0024 125.490125 128.021375 yeah and that maybe on the lesser
sw3118B-ms98-a-0025 128.021375 132.761875 crimes that aren't too severe that's a little stringent [laughter]
sw3118B-ms98-a-0026 132.761875 139.426375 especially because there's twelve the thing about it is i think jury selection too a lot of times um
sw3118B-ms98-a-0027 139.426375 145.088500 the lawyers are able to pick and choose who they want on the jury and they can sway them that way too
sw3118B-ms98-a-0028 145.088500 162.396750 [silence]
sw3118B-ms98-a-0029 162.396750 171.385875 i know i don't think well [noise] i guess you really can't but the other thing is when they have the sensational trials how they get people who aren't swayed by the news either
sw3118B-ms98-a-0030 171.385875 181.872125 so um but then again you know they the one of the questions they asked is should it just be decided by a judge and that's kind of tricky too because a lot of positions the judges are in they
sw3118B-ms98-a-0031 181.872125 190.190500 they can't be fired you know they have to they stay till they retire and [laughter-sometimes] they're pretty partial in their judgements [laughter-too]
sw3118B-ms98-a-0032 190.190500 199.021000 [silence]
sw3118B-ms98-a-0033 199.021000 200.472625 i know
sw3118B-ms98-a-0034 200.472625 223.666375 [silence]
sw3118B-ms98-a-0035 223.666375 225.020375 yeah
sw3118B-ms98-a-0036 225.020375 230.108375 [silence]
sw3118B-ms98-a-0037 230.108375 239.156750 i think in some cases they are but they know they get to decide how severe the sentence is if it's you know so that's another thing [laughter] where they have the power but
sw3118B-ms98-a-0038 239.156750 246.172625 [noise] maybe juries could be less than twelve people or would that be more fair or less fair maybe there should be more than twelve [laughter-people] i don't
sw3118B-ms98-a-0039 246.172625 248.939375 [silence]
sw3118B-ms98-a-0040 248.939375 251.691625 [laughter-i] [laughter-know] [laughter]
sw3118B-ms98-a-0041 251.691625 253.264375 i know i don't know
sw3118B-ms98-a-0042 253.264375 264.322125 [silence]
sw3118B-ms98-a-0043 264.322125 269.497625 that's true and i've never been on jury duty but they have to keep going and going [laughter-and] [laughter-going]
sw3118B-ms98-a-0044 269.497625 273.487750 and lose their not lose their jobs but not go to work
sw3118B-ms98-a-0045 273.487750 279.789375 [silence]
sw3118B-ms98-a-0046 279.789375 281.326625 it could be [vocalized-noise]
sw3118B-ms98-a-0047 281.326625 284.258250 [silence]
sw3118B-ms98-a-0048 284.258250 295.870375 really i've never seen one in real life either so i don't have you know i don't know that much about it but i think it seems that we have a a pretty fair system compared to other countries i don't know how we could make it more fair i really don't
sw3118B-ms98-a-0049 295.870375 302.703375 the unanimous vote is questionable though and and how how many cases get juries might want to be reviewed too
sw3118B-ms98-a-0050 302.703375 303.734500 [silence]
sw3118B-ms98-a-0051 303.734500 305.027250 because uh
sw3118B-ms98-a-0052 305.027250 305.493250 [noise]
sw3118B-ms98-a-0053 305.493250 309.821750 i don't know if you should ha[ve]- r[eally]- really have a jury for s[mall]- a small
sw3118B-ms98-a-0054 309.821750 311.728375 [noise] infraction
sw3118B-ms98-a-0055 311.728375 315.205375 but i'm not sure who gets [laughter-them] [laughter-i] [laughter-don't] [laughter-know] [laughter-anything] [laughter]
sw3118B-ms98-a-0056 315.205375 328.609250 [silence]
sw3118B-ms98-a-0057 328.609250 330.254625 right
sw3118B-ms98-a-0058 330.254625 335.222375 [silence]
sw3118B-ms98-a-0059 335.222375 341.155375 no whoever came up with this was pretty smart because it was pretty uh unique i think when they started it
sw3118B-ms98-a-0060 341.155375 342.230250 [silence]
sw3118B-ms98-a-0061 342.230250 346.661125 so [laughter] how long do we [laughter-need] [laughter-to] [laughter-talk] [laughter] do you know
sw3118B-ms98-a-0062 346.661125 348.456875 [silence]
sw3118B-ms98-a-0063 348.456875 356.067125 okay um in um what do i do now do you know anything or just wait for someone else
