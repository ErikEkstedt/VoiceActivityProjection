sw3141A-ms98-a-0002 2.533500 12.798500 one very old fat cat [laughter] Prissy and that's why Pat won't ever let me have a party at my house [laughter]
sw3141A-ms98-a-0003 12.798500 15.549500 that's right
sw3141A-ms98-a-0004 15.549500 18.301375 she does shed a lot of fur
sw3141A-ms98-a-0005 18.301375 19.494375 [silence]
sw3141A-ms98-a-0006 19.494375 34.062000 she's we've had her for a long time we used to have a Spitz that kind of got deposited on us when a cousin was getting a divorce and we were supposed to keep her temporarily for about twelve years [laughter]
sw3141A-ms98-a-0007 34.062000 36.864750 usually we've had dogs or cats
sw3141A-ms98-a-0008 36.864750 38.737375 [silence]
sw3141A-ms98-a-0009 38.737375 40.901125 yes
sw3141A-ms98-a-0010 40.901125 51.509000 [silence]
sw3141A-ms98-a-0011 51.509000 54.936625 yeah i'm reaching that point too
sw3141A-ms98-a-0012 54.936625 59.147625 [silence]
sw3141A-ms98-a-0013 59.147625 60.720375 um-hum

sw3141A-ms98-a-0015 65.356750 67.417875 um-hum
sw3141A-ms98-a-0016 67.417875 76.840500 well i'm thinking of a next time about going back to a dog though because the cats really do shed a lot you just never get rid of the cat hair
sw3141A-ms98-a-0017 76.840500 87.689125 and i know there are a lot of dogs that are pretty clean and don't shed so Emily wants a dog a lot of her friends have little house mops kind of like yours [laughter]
sw3141A-ms98-a-0018 87.689125 89.712375 [silence]
sw3141A-ms98-a-0019 89.712375 91.261875 um-hum

sw3141A-ms98-a-0021 92.875375 98.852625 but do you have to let him outside for all his business and all yeah
sw3141A-ms98-a-0022 98.852625 102.780000 but see that's what would be hard for us since we're not there a lot
sw3141A-ms98-a-0023 102.780000 103.935250 [silence]
sw3141A-ms98-a-0024 103.935250 105.706250 um-hum

sw3141A-ms98-a-0026 108.688875 110.364625 yeah
sw3141A-ms98-a-0027 110.364625 119.042000 i think Jay would go bananas over that though [laughter-he] he likes for our house to be as secure as possible [laughter]
sw3141A-ms98-a-0028 119.042000 121.534375 [silence]
sw3141A-ms98-a-0029 121.534375 123.386375 um-hum
sw3141A-ms98-a-0030 123.386375 126.319250 [silence]

sw3141A-ms98-a-0033 132.007375 142.288500 that can be so therapeutic though when when i really want to just crawl into a shell i think uh wouldn't it be nice just to lay on the bed and pet the cat [laughter]
sw3141A-ms98-a-0034 142.288500 144.291625 um-hum
sw3141A-ms98-a-0035 144.291625 152.028875 [silence]

sw3141A-ms98-a-0039 158.622125 160.788250 [silence]
sw3141A-ms98-a-0040 160.788250 172.819000 [noise] and i really i- i don't think i'm prejudiced since i've had both but i think cats are more prone to really have personalities i mean they own you rather than the other way around 
sw3141A-ms98-a-0041 172.819000 181.288375 and i really do believe that i get a kick out of seeing my seventy seven year old aunt with her animals and she had a cat get killed
sw3141A-ms98-a-0042 181.288375 191.419375 not too long ago and she said no more you know i just i can't go through that again and it wasn't three months before [laughter-she] [laughter-had] another one and just adapting to it just
sw3141A-ms98-a-0043 191.419375 193.618000 like she always had
sw3141A-ms98-a-0044 193.618000 198.369250 and it's really neat for people living alone like you say with your friend
sw3141A-ms98-a-0045 198.369250 201.684000 [silence]
sw3141A-ms98-a-0046 201.684000 203.290125 um-hum

sw3141A-ms98-a-0048 209.600250 211.268750 yeah
sw3141A-ms98-a-0049 211.268750 218.226750 growing up it was so funny because mother would always have a soft heart for strays and
sw3141A-ms98-a-0050 218.226750 232.059125 we never back then you didn't spay and neuter your animals that much you just kind of put up with whatever happened and she could never get rid of them_1 fast enough before the next litter came along it wasn't usual unusual for us to have six and seven cats and
sw3141A-ms98-a-0051 232.059125 244.002250 i remember my first camera experience as trying to put cats up on a porch and take pictures of them_1 that were going to be award winning type [laughter] photos they've always been a part of my life
sw3141A-ms98-a-0052 244.002250 245.958875 [silence]
sw3141A-ms98-a-0053 245.958875 257.315125 oh yeah we had a Cocker Spaniel growing up but but the cats were the things that i loved and especially with being around kittens and the babies and all
sw3141A-ms98-a-0054 257.315125 261.493500 no no dad n[ever]- never would have allowed that
sw3141A-ms98-a-0055 261.493500 275.225500 so they always just kind of showed up and came and went and had babies and [laughter] we played with them we we used them_1 as dolls sometimes we'd dress them_1 up and put them_1 in carriages as much as they'd tolerate it
sw3141A-ms98-a-0056 275.225500 277.219625 so it was always fun
sw3141A-ms98-a-0057 277.219625 281.363750 [silence]
sw3141A-ms98-a-0058 281.363750 284.494500 oh yeah
sw3141A-ms98-a-0059 284.494500 287.303125 [silence]
sw3141A-ms98-a-0060 287.303125 290.580750 that was traumatic wasn't it yeah
sw3141A-ms98-a-0061 290.580750 292.691000 [silence]
sw3141A-ms98-a-0062 292.691000 294.385000 um-hum
sw3141A-ms98-a-0063 294.385000 298.327000 [silence]
sw3141A-ms98-a-0064 298.327000 299.999875 yeah
sw3141A-ms98-a-0065 299.999875 305.077500 [silence]
sw3141A-ms98-a-0066 305.077500 306.622875 um-hum
sw3141A-ms98-a-0067 306.622875 308.217375 [silence]
sw3141A-ms98-a-0068 308.217375 313.723500 yeah that's exactly what happened with ours and my brother really took it
sw3141A-ms98-a-0069 313.723500 327.057750 hard because he was the one that had left the gate open so he blamed himself personally although you know there were so many things that could have been different but it was hard for him to cope with it being his fault
sw3141A-ms98-a-0070 327.057750 334.202875 so i do hate that i that's one reason i like cats and critters that can stay inside because_1 you don't face that
sw3141A-ms98-a-0071 334.202875 335.840250 -[it']s it's hard
sw3141A-ms98-a-0072 335.840250 349.905000 especially if you really do get attached to them_1 i'm i'm already kind of preparing for Prissy dying because_1 she's pretty old and fat and oh i just know it's going to come sooner or later so that's one reason i've been letting Emily talk about dogs because_1 i think
sw3141A-ms98-a-0073 349.905000 355.812750 uh we we say that's going to be the end but i think when it really comes to it we'll want another pet 
sw3141A-ms98-a-0074 355.812750 369.587500 she's at least thirteen or fourteen we don't know exactly because_1 we got her as a young kitten or a young cat and didn't know that much about her she's a neat cat i mean she owns us all the way
sw3141A-ms98-a-0075 369.587500 371.143375 but
sw3141A-ms98-a-0076 371.143375 375.992125 does require a little bit of work and housecleaning [laughter]
sw3141A-ms98-a-0077 375.992125 378.805375 [silence]
sw3141A-ms98-a-0078 378.805375 381.110500 yeah yeah
sw3141A-ms98-a-0079 381.110500 383.143250 [silence]
sw3141A-ms98-a-0080 383.143250 389.972000 um-hum and you have the problem when you travel too we always we board her now and that gets kind of expensive
sw3141A-ms98-a-0081 389.972000 393.530750 [silence]
sw3141A-ms98-a-0082 393.530750 395.100250 yeah
sw3141A-ms98-a-0083 395.100250 397.166125 [silence]
sw3141A-ms98-a-0084 397.166125 399.248375 yeah
sw3141A-ms98-a-0085 399.248375 401.567125 um-hum
sw3141A-ms98-a-0086 401.567125 403.239875 where'd y'all go
sw3141A-ms98-a-0087 403.239875 404.692875 [silence]
sw3141A-ms98-a-0088 404.692875 409.356125 [laughter-no] i guess not [laughter] it's not pet related
sw3141A-ms98-a-0089 409.356125 413.124125 oh boy yeah
sw3141A-ms98-a-0090 413.124125 415.445000 oh how neat
sw3141A-ms98-a-0091 415.445000 419.234750 but the puppy survived [laughter]
sw3141A-ms98-a-0092 419.234750 423.065250 [silence]
sw3141A-ms98-a-0093 423.065250 432.843875 and you know my aunt says that they do drug them i just went bananas when she told me that that was a fact that she had shopped kennels
sw3141A-ms98-a-0094 432.843875 444.847250 and vets and that they all very lightly sedate them so that they sleep a lot and that just gave me the creeps because_1 i you know i hate to think they did that to anything or anybody
sw3141A-ms98-a-0095 444.847250 449.673250 but she said every vet's office and kennel if they would let i[t]- if they
