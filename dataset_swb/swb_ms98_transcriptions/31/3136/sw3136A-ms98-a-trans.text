sw3136A-ms98-a-0021 137.372500 151.229750 well i'm uh we've had problems with our yard we it was one big weed is what it was it was just horrible and my neighbors on either side of me have beautiful lawns and we have this God awful ugly thing and
sw3136A-ms98-a-0022 151.229750 159.009875 and i know they must think [noise] you know i wish those people would do something about their yard but my husband got some new fertilizer and stuff that
sw3136A-ms98-a-0023 159.009875 172.997250 that seems to be helping and he put it on the front yard to see how you know it would do and stuff before he put it on the backyard but we've got a Great Dane in the back and she has eaten everything i have put out there she's eaten my crepe myrtle trees
sw3136A-ms98-a-0024 172.997250 183.662500 i know and she's eaten the bushes i've tried to i spent like eight hours planting this nice garden out there and i barricaded it up so she couldn't get into it
sw3136A-ms98-a-0025 183.662500 190.262375 and i went and took a shower and looked back out there and she was already in it and i was so mad
sw3136A-ms98-a-0026 190.262375 195.130000 so i can't do anything back there because_1 she just she destroys it
sw3136A-ms98-a-0027 195.130000 198.993875 but i've tried out in the front but like you said that that freeze that came
sw3136A-ms98-a-0028 198.993875 210.496625 i had some bushes that uh some shrubs i pu[t]- put out front and it killed those too so uh i'm i'm just real discouraged with the whole thing i just don't even want to do anything

sw3136A-ms98-a-0040 240.979500 248.878000 i know we can't either but i've got pre[tty]- two good size cottonwood trees out in my front yard uh you know one on either side of the yard
sw3136A-ms98-a-0041 248.878000 256.709250 a[nd]- and they're big and [vocalized-noise] they're real full and everything you know in the summer time but it it's killing everything underneath
sw3136A-ms98-a-0042 256.709250 259.351500 where the leaves are shading the tree but
sw3136A-ms98-a-0043 259.351500 271.998375 toward the end of the summer you know when everything starts dying off and whatnot and then the light can get through the tree then the grass starts growing but by then it's so late then the winter comes and it stops you know it's just it's a never ending cycle 
sw3136A-ms98-a-0044 271.998375 280.217375 yeah it really is so we've been trying to get something or to pull some grass underneath there and and whatnot so

sw3136A-ms98-a-0054 329.996875 338.231125 and they've got mini-blinds and stuff but only only one is really like in the flower bed part and the other one is out on the porch
sw3136A-ms98-a-0055 338.231125 341.825375 so there's not really much i can do about that
