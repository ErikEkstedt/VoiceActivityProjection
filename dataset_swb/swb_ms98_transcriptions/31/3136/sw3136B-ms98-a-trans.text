sw3136B-ms98-a-0002 1.720625 16.474000 okay i i guess first of all i'll just say we haven't done much uh gardening we do lawn work all the time but uh our gardening we lost remember the last two freezes i don't know how long you've been here
sw3136B-ms98-a-0003 16.474000 25.239625 but we lost our bushes in those and have been waiting to plant new ones and so as far as our bushes we don't have any
sw3136B-ms98-a-0004 25.239625 33.258750 but we do have some blackberry bushes and and they were really hearty and stayed on and we've done really well with them
sw3136B-ms98-a-0005 33.258750 45.456500 um-hum yeah and so they've been really good and the ki[ds]- i had to [laughter] the first year i had to tell the kids not to pick them when they were red because they were supposed to be blackberries
sw3136B-ms98-a-0006 45.456500 50.010375 but uh we go out it it's hard to go out when it's this hot
sw3136B-ms98-a-0007 50.010375 58.489750 and uh but uh keep the weeds out of them and and keep them off the ground so the ants don't eat them and they're okay
sw3136B-ms98-a-0008 58.489750 60.287500 yeah um
sw3136B-ms98-a-0009 60.287500 66.984625 [silence]
sw3136B-ms98-a-0010 66.984625 67.987000 uh-huh
sw3136B-ms98-a-0011 67.987000 74.347250 [silence]
sw3136B-ms98-a-0012 74.347250 75.745875 yeah
sw3136B-ms98-a-0013 75.745875 84.497500 yeah uh we have some flowers that have they just are real hearty also and they're bulbs and they come up every year
sw3136B-ms98-a-0014 84.497500 88.326250 but uh they're getting too thick i need to go thin them out
sw3136B-ms98-a-0015 88.326250 89.982250 and uh
sw3136B-ms98-a-0016 89.982250 99.451500 there a i don't know what kind of flowers they are they're real common around here they're they're orange and they look like a lily sort of uh
sw3136B-ms98-a-0017 99.451500 100.977625 yeah
sw3136B-ms98-a-0018 100.977625 102.256125 [silence]
sw3136B-ms98-a-0019 102.256125 112.469375 no but i think they're real pretty when it rains because their petals don't soak the rain in they they keep the the rain on the outside little rain drops and and they look real pretty after the rain
sw3136B-ms98-a-0020 112.469375 119.145250 and so i really like them but i need to get out and and um [noise] do that now as far as our grass it grows
sw3136B-ms98-a-0021 119.145250 122.405625 crazy [laughter] it just keeps growing and growing
sw3136B-ms98-a-0022 122.405625 128.438375 and uh sometimes my husband does it and sometimes my son does it but it just is
sw3136B-ms98-a-0023 128.438375 138.471625 i don't i don't know i've lived in Utah my whole life and we can't seem to get ours green i don't know yeah

sw3136B-ms98-a-0041 199.495750 209.965375 [silence]
sw3136B-ms98-a-0042 209.965375 219.714625 the the other problem that we have well it's funny because the one the two bushes on the ends of the house that i think are ugly they lived
sw3136B-ms98-a-0043 219.714625 223.232875 [laughter-and] [laughter-so] i don't i don't know [noise]
sw3136B-ms98-a-0044 223.232875 226.167125 uh so like i wanted to go out and kill them too
sw3136B-ms98-a-0045 226.167125 229.770750 [laughter] they had no right to live but anyway [laughter]
sw3136B-ms98-a-0046 229.770750 242.227250 uh under our trees we get a a north sun and uh the it looks like our trees don't have any grass under them you know we just can't grow uh grass underneath there
sw3136B-ms98-a-0047 242.227250 247.742875 [silence]
sw3136B-ms98-a-0048 247.742875 249.360000 um-hum
sw3136B-ms98-a-0049 249.360000 256.286750 [silence]
sw3136B-ms98-a-0050 256.286750 257.701500 yeah
sw3136B-ms98-a-0051 257.701500 268.495625 [silence]

sw3136B-ms98-a-0053 270.273875 274.497125 it's a vicious cycle isn't it it's really
sw3136B-ms98-a-0054 274.497125 279.462625 [silence]
sw3136B-ms98-a-0055 279.462625 287.041500 well i don't we've never done anything like this but we've been thinking you know if we built up um
sw3136B-ms98-a-0056 287.041500 301.672625 you know either a a wood wooden like trench thing around where our bushes were and filled it like with a nice dirt then maybe we could plant some either flowers or or some new bushes in there that would live
sw3136B-ms98-a-0057 301.672625 306.241500 and so i think that we're going to try that i i think the
sw3136B-ms98-a-0058 306.241500 307.324625 [silence]
sw3136B-ms98-a-0059 307.324625 319.708625 i think that's pretty much what we have decided now i have two long windows and i'm trying to decide whether to put like bushes in front of them or not you know maybe just halfway up the window or something like that
sw3136B-ms98-a-0060 319.708625 324.963625 so people can't see and hear too much [laughter] it just
sw3136B-ms98-a-0061 324.963625 331.991500 [silence]
sw3136B-ms98-a-0062 331.991500 333.486000 yeah

sw3136B-ms98-a-0065 338.792375 340.911125 [silence]
sw3136B-ms98-a-0066 340.911125 348.717000 that's what our two rooms are on the front too with these long windows one is a bedroom for our our oldest son and one is um
sw3136B-ms98-a-0067 348.717000 351.989000 an office that my husband and i work in
sw3136B-ms98-a-0068 351.989000 363.816625 and so i i really don't like it too much because then the back of our house faces that well the flowers are out by the back of the house so and that's where the front room is
sw3136B-ms98-a-0069 363.816625 368.479625 so that's not too bad but i like to look at the flowers they're pretty
sw3136B-ms98-a-0070 368.479625 370.215000 [silence]
sw3136B-ms98-a-0071 370.215000 373.471125 [laughter] yeah [laughter]
sw3136B-ms98-a-0072 373.471125 384.480750 but it's funny because_1 uh you try so hard i think sometimes to to anyway i do to do our yard and then it's like the wind blows
sw3136B-ms98-a-0073 384.480750 396.454875 everything whether the weeds from your yard to your neighbors or yours to them or and so even if you did get it under control it seems like in just a few months it would all be back and
sw3136B-ms98-a-0074 396.454875 399.998000 [silence]
sw3136B-ms98-a-0075 399.998000 404.491750 it's hard to get out a lot and do that yard work
sw3136B-ms98-a-0076 404.491750 407.488625 [silence]
sw3136B-ms98-a-0077 407.488625 408.820000 uh-huh
sw3136B-ms98-a-0078 408.820000 417.218000 [silence]
sw3136B-ms98-a-0079 417.218000 424.811750 i know it is it's not my favorite thing in the world either i'm glad i have an old enough son to do it for me now
sw3136B-ms98-a-0080 424.811750 426.997875 [silence]
sw3136B-ms98-a-0081 426.997875 428.253750 uh-huh
sw3136B-ms98-a-0082 428.253750 431.493125 [silence]
sw3136B-ms98-a-0083 431.493125 432.997000 yeah
sw3136B-ms98-a-0084 432.997000 440.310500 yeah [laughter] well that is one chore that we will pay him for if he'll go do the yard work out outside so
sw3136B-ms98-a-0085 440.310500 441.713500 yeah
sw3136B-ms98-a-0086 441.713500 444.330875 [silence]
sw3136B-ms98-a-0087 444.330875 447.698750 right exactly exactly
