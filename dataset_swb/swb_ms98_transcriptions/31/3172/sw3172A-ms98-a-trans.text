sw3172A-ms98-a-0002 0.017375 1.846750 the budget seems to be 
sw3172A-ms98-a-0003 1.846750 12.818000 oh on a number of people's minds and often times when peoples talk about cutting budget or wishing that the government didn't spend money here and there i hear them_1 talk about uh cutting
sw3172A-ms98-a-0004 12.818000 20.867375 what they call aid to some foreign countries and people don't understand why are we give a million here or a billion there and
sw3172A-ms98-a-0005 20.867375 30.549750 and whether they like it or not or whether they understand it or not the government just simply develops dependencies on us uh y[ou]- start giving a country uh
sw3172A-ms98-a-0006 30.549750 35.144750 x amount of dollars for so many years and their whole economy and their whole
sw3172A-ms98-a-0007 35.144750 40.230875 uh system is uh used to it and then you threaten with whatever
sw3172A-ms98-a-0008 40.230875 49.427875 you wish you know you would say well you're not acting right we're gonna withhold it or you're not doing this that or the other or we want our base here or we want whatever
sw3172A-ms98-a-0009 49.427875 58.599625 and the government's been doing that for years and will probably continue to do that for years and i'm not sure if the general public uh
sw3172A-ms98-a-0010 58.599625 70.679000 thinks about it that way when they start saying why did we give money here or money there and but there are some things even when we what we spend in inside the US it seems a little
sw3172A-ms98-a-0011 70.679000 74.849375 far fetched and not necessarily for the common good
sw3172A-ms98-a-0012 74.849375 79.520250 uh lot of the money for the arts seem to benefit only a few
sw3172A-ms98-a-0013 79.520250 83.494375 and usually those who are um
sw3172A-ms98-a-0014 83.494375 88.410000 rich anyway [laughter-or] have e[nough]- have enough money to attend those kind of functions
sw3172A-ms98-a-0015 88.410000 97.047875 so it's [vocalized-noise] that's a a controversy of course there's only a hundred and seventy million going to the NEA but a hundred and seventy million's
sw3172A-ms98-a-0016 97.047875 99.764625 a bit [laughter-and] it's something so
