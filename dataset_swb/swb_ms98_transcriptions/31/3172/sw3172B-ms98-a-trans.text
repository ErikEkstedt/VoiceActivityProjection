sw3172B-ms98-a-0004 105.694500 106.755750 [noise]
sw3172B-ms98-a-0005 106.755750 112.441750 um i agree with you on the international aid and um
sw3172B-ms98-a-0006 112.441750 121.893750 i don't think a lot of people realize too on we can't live isolated our world is such an international economy now and um
sw3172B-ms98-a-0007 121.893750 126.198000 [noise] uh especially with the problems in Eastern Europe and Russia
sw3172B-ms98-a-0008 126.198000 127.475375 uh
sw3172B-ms98-a-0009 127.475375 140.487375 i know a lot of people feel that we've given so much aid and we have so many economic problems and and i agree that we do but um it's also in our country's interest um
sw3172B-ms98-a-0010 140.487375 152.794250 to have a balanced world economy um sometimes it does seem like we're the ones doing all the giving um and i have to admit sometimes i have wondered if uh
sw3172B-ms98-a-0011 152.794250 161.297375 we run into problems which is is certainly a possibility if anyone would come [laughter] to lend us a hand but um
sw3172B-ms98-a-0012 161.297375 162.898750 [noise]
sw3172B-ms98-a-0013 162.898750 165.034500 i do think uh
sw3172B-ms98-a-0014 165.034500 170.177500 [noise] [vocalized-noise] this is a hard area i'm there's some areas that i feel uh
sw3172B-ms98-a-0015 170.177500 181.091750 need a lot of work um [noise] and improvement and education comes to mind i know they are working on trimming defense um
sw3172B-ms98-a-0016 181.091750 182.101125 [silence]
sw3172B-ms98-a-0017 182.101125 188.024000 this has been such a long process that has gotten us to the point that we're in
sw3172B-ms98-a-0018 188.024000 193.379625 but unless they start working on it um
sw3172B-ms98-a-0019 193.379625 198.435125 it really it it already is is close to uncontrollable
sw3172B-ms98-a-0020 198.435125 199.444125 [silence]
sw3172B-ms98-a-0021 199.444125 202.574750 but i'm not sure exactly what practical
sw3172B-ms98-a-0022 202.574750 204.849125 uh steps
sw3172B-ms98-a-0023 204.849125 212.631125 uh could be um i wish i had some of the figures in front of me now to know the percentage um
sw3172B-ms98-a-0024 212.631125 225.532250 i do think one step once something you touched on in talking about the arts is that as far as percentages go i think uh money should go that benefits
sw3172B-ms98-a-0025 225.532250 234.577000 the most um i say uh i believe in um education and not necessarily the
sw3172B-ms98-a-0026 234.577000 241.658875 federal um it can be done on on different levels too because i think that's our future if we
sw3172B-ms98-a-0027 241.658875 248.725750 um if our education system falls behind that of say Germany and Japan and um
sw3172B-ms98-a-0028 248.725750 253.886250 some of the other countries we need to be able to be competitive um
sw3172B-ms98-a-0029 253.886250 255.571750 [silence]
sw3172B-ms98-a-0030 255.571750 258.629000 it's that's an area i would not want cut
sw3172B-ms98-a-0031 258.629000 272.583625 there are a lot of areas i think that money could be better spent i think sometimes the money they spend on studies to decide on things is way out of proportion and and of course everyone's heard the stories of the
sw3172B-ms98-a-0032 272.583625 278.165000 several thousand dollar hammer and um you know somewhere along the line um
sw3172B-ms98-a-0033 278.165000 280.244750 there've been some
sw3172B-ms98-a-0034 280.244750 281.325625 [silence]
