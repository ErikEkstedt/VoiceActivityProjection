sw3126A-ms98-a-0066 269.792625 277.503250 my cousins have a boat my boat is sitting in my driveway not running and uh so we go up there and we decided
sw3126A-ms98-a-0067 277.503250 286.870625 that we'd you know go out fir[st]- we got everybody's tents up and camp made and all that and said come on let's go fishing we hauled in well we brought in
sw3126A-ms98-a-0068 286.870625 290.876125 thirty three fish and we had thrown a bunch of little ones back
sw3126A-ms98-a-0069 290.876125 305.711500 and uh so then we had a huge fish fry the next afternoon and we went back out fishing and we caught and brought in thirty three more and had thrown a bunch of the little ones back but we had more fun those kids
sw3126A-ms98-a-0070 305.711500 309.247000 they've got real fishing poles but they're the little short ones
sw3126A-ms98-a-0071 309.247000 318.370250 and it was so funny because i mean they'd just be hanging over the side of the boat mom i think i got a fish i think i got a fish oh it was hysterical but
sw3126A-ms98-a-0072 318.370250 327.709125 Jamie's getting to the age now that when i get up and go fishing early in the morning he wants to go too you know he doesn't want to get left behind anymore
sw3126A-ms98-a-0073 327.709125 331.956000 so it's getting a little difficult to do that but

sw3126A-ms98-a-0080 355.154250 364.788125 but where we camp there there's a you know little bit of a inlet where we park the boats and stuff so real early in the morning before it gets hot and then you know right at dusk
sw3126A-ms98-a-0081 364.788125 377.211500 um down in the trees down there boy all those little sunfish come up and they'll go down there while i'm cooking dinner and just start reeling those little babies in and they have more fun with that
sw3126A-ms98-a-0082 377.211500 389.414125 oh usually i'll buy them_1 a thing of worms or a lot of times i'll just give them_1 a piece of bacon and they're taugh[t]- they'll tear up bacon and stick it i mean those they'll they'll bite empty hooks that's what's so funny
sw3126A-ms98-a-0083 389.414125 395.980875 and when we're out chasing the big stripers we use those perch for [laughter-bait] [laughter]
