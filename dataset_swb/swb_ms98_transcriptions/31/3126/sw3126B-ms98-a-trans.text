sw3126B-ms98-a-0047 162.612750 170.727250 and so i i've been spoiled by that uh but i had a string of seven or eight years in a row
sw3126B-ms98-a-0048 170.727250 178.788250 of uh sort of a close knit group we would just hop in the car and drive straight through two thousand miles
sw3126B-ms98-a-0049 178.788250 186.500875 and uh we started out fishing out of a lodge and then we started uh either taking our own canoes or renting them
sw3126B-ms98-a-0050 186.500875 189.343000 when we got there and hitting a few of the
sw3126B-ms98-a-0051 189.343000 197.254500 you know smaller lakes along the river chain and uh catch Northern Pike and walleye primarily
sw3126B-ms98-a-0052 197.254500 200.734500 and sometimes Lake Trout also
sw3126B-ms98-a-0053 200.734500 210.517625 so we'd always go the first week in June you know essentially as soon as school was out and everything is all over and done we'd uh we go uh
sw3126B-ms98-a-0054 210.517625 217.775500 course one year i went two weeks too early with a friend that was he at this point he'd graduated from college and was in the Army and
sw3126B-ms98-a-0055 217.775500 222.706500 he had a two week period he he had to work with before he got shipped off to Germany
sw3126B-ms98-a-0056 222.706500 236.992000 and so i went with him in the middle of May and much to our surprise when we got there all the lakes were still frozen [laughter] [laughter-no] yeah the first week we were there we just had to camp and
sw3126B-ms98-a-0057 236.992000 247.414125 uh we could go on the streams they were open up you know the f[lowing]- where the water was flowing but the lakes themselves were still iced over for the whole yeah whole first week we were there
sw3126B-ms98-a-0058 247.414125 259.236625 but then the next week they were just just like day and night difference we had some rain and wind and it it cleared all the lakes off and uh you know the fishing was already really picking up but uh
