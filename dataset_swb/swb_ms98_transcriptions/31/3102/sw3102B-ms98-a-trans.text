sw3102B-ms98-a-0101 320.175000 328.803125 you know i that's the way a lot of my friends did it and you know they weren't they didn't take it very serious i know i took it real serious because_1 i didn't start to college until you know

sw3102B-ms98-a-0103 329.031875 334.219125 i was about eight or ten years and uh you know out of what i should have been in school
sw3102B-ms98-a-0104 334.219125 342.364875 but uh you know so i think that helped me be real serious about it and i i ended up graduating with like a three point six
sw3102B-ms98-a-0105 342.364875 352.215250 yeah so i you know and that was hard cause i- i had two kids and you know a family and everything else so i had a lot of different hats to wear all at the same time but
