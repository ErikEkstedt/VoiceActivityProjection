sw3102A-ms98-a-0003 5.515250 12.038375 advice for people taking for parents uh help their their kids through college 
sw3102A-ms98-a-0004 12.038375 16.234375 no i just graduated from college yes

sw3102A-ms98-a-0007 20.210250 26.471625 [silence]
sw3102A-ms98-a-0008 26.471625 35.709875 um i would want them to make that decision and i would you know uh i pretty much made my decision on my own and my b[rother]- older brother likewise
sw3102A-ms98-a-0009 35.709875 45.564375 and uh you know we we were both pretty much happy with what we did so i think i would not push them towards any one place
sw3102A-ms98-a-0010 45.564375 61.122625 [silence]
sw3102A-ms98-a-0011 61.122625 62.533125 uh-huh
sw3102A-ms98-a-0012 62.533125 66.238250 [silence]

sw3102A-ms98-a-0014 67.651000 71.889875 [silence]
sw3102A-ms98-a-0015 71.889875 73.954375 yeah exactly
sw3102A-ms98-a-0016 73.954375 83.406125 i think one of the first things kids ought to look for is first of all they have to decide what they want to major in and then you know find a school that's good for that
sw3102A-ms98-a-0017 83.406125 87.092875 [silence]
sw3102A-ms98-a-0018 87.092875 98.729375 well i picked it for a couple of reasons it was only about an hour and ten minutes away from home so it was far enough away that i was away but yet close enough if i ever wanted to go home i could
sw3102A-ms98-a-0019 98.729375 100.216000 uh
sw3102A-ms98-a-0020 100.216000 101.951625 pardon me
sw3102A-ms98-a-0021 101.951625 105.351125 yeah i lived up at school yeah
sw3102A-ms98-a-0022 105.351125 114.921875 uh another reason was uh i paid for my entire education so i had to look for something that i could afford economically you know
sw3102A-ms98-a-0023 114.921875 120.379375 you know and uh Clarion was oh it was roughly around six thousand a year
sw3102A-ms98-a-0024 120.379375 121.880625 [silence]
sw3102A-ms98-a-0025 121.880625 130.608875 yeah that was for everything and now i did not go out a lot and i did not order out a lot and i you know i did not spend money on myself
sw3102A-ms98-a-0026 130.608875 134.445125 but uh then again i was there for school so
sw3102A-ms98-a-0027 134.445125 135.820375 uh
sw3102A-ms98-a-0028 135.820375 144.094875 and then another reason was i was not sure you know i always wanted to go to school for nursing and then at the last minute i changed my mind
sw3102A-ms98-a-0029 144.094875 153.736750 and i knew that Clarion was known you know [vocalized-noise] for two things actually for their they are known as a teacher's school
sw3102A-ms98-a-0030 153.736750 159.664250 and also for their business so that's what i ended up going for is for business uh-huh
sw3102A-ms98-a-0031 159.664250 162.371500 [silence]
sw3102A-ms98-a-0032 162.371500 168.308000 no no not yet i am moving shortly so i am not looking around here

sw3102A-ms98-a-0043 205.319625 220.925125 [silence]
sw3102A-ms98-a-0044 220.925125 222.755375 exactly
sw3102A-ms98-a-0045 222.755375 230.711125 [silence]

sw3102A-ms98-a-0048 252.748500 254.690125 exactly yeah
sw3102A-ms98-a-0049 254.690125 260.881875 it does have a lot of bearing on it whether you're paying for yourself or whether your parents are you know 
sw3102A-ms98-a-0050 260.881875 267.869125 [silence]
sw3102A-ms98-a-0051 267.869125 276.009250 uh yeah because i was paying for it myself i kind of slacked off because i felt it was mine and i could do with it what i wanted
sw3102A-ms98-a-0052 276.009250 280.184375 i think if my parents would have paid for it they would have been on me you know
sw3102A-ms98-a-0053 280.184375 288.823750 uh they pretty much got to the point well well you know you are at that age and you are going to have to decide what you want to do if you goof up it's your fault it's not ours you know
sw3102A-ms98-a-0054 288.823750 294.950875 and then lets me go and i mean i did not do poorly i finished with a two five that's not that wonderful either
sw3102A-ms98-a-0055 294.950875 297.730625 but uh you know i
sw3102A-ms98-a-0056 297.730625 308.361625 i- i mean i worked i did not you know goof around i worked it was just harder you know it wa[s]- i do not know i was used to being you know on top and when i started there it was like you are mediocre so
sw3102A-ms98-a-0057 308.361625 317.630375 [silence]
sw3102A-ms98-a-0058 317.630375 318.978000 uh-huh

sw3102A-ms98-a-0060 320.619875 321.953250 yeah
sw3102A-ms98-a-0061 321.953250 333.249125 [silence]
sw3102A-ms98-a-0062 333.249125 334.642375 uh-huh
sw3102A-ms98-a-0063 334.642375 341.282375 [silence]
sw3102A-ms98-a-0064 341.282375 343.442375 oh wow that's really good
sw3102A-ms98-a-0065 343.442375 345.816375 [silence]
sw3102A-ms98-a-0066 345.816375 347.198375 uh-huh
sw3102A-ms98-a-0067 347.198375 351.269875 [silence]
sw3102A-ms98-a-0068 351.269875 365.447500 yeah see well i screwed myself up also there was a point in time that i decided that i did not want to in school and my parents never pushed me until my dad just said what are you going to do and i said well i am going to go because i have not whipping butter the rest of my life you know
sw3102A-ms98-a-0069 365.447500 374.372125 so i went and i just took business well being as i was paying for it myself you know i just kept you do not get into your major until like your second or third year
sw3102A-ms98-a-0070 374.372125 380.153125 and i am going into my third year and i decided well i do not want to do accounting anymore right
sw3102A-ms98-a-0071 380.153125 391.092000 and i thought oh my God i am paying for this myself i am not switching completely because i will put myself a year behind so i switched to finance and i liked it better [noise]
sw3102A-ms98-a-0072 391.092000 396.684750 and i pulled myself from a two oh to a two five you know in my last year my senior year
sw3102A-ms98-a-0073 396.684750 407.124250 but i would have really liked to go on uh secondary ed with math education but it was just the fact i was paying for it myself i was not going to put myself behind another year
sw3102A-ms98-a-0074 407.124250 413.279250 [silence]
sw3102A-ms98-a-0075 413.279250 414.634375 uh-huh
sw3102A-ms98-a-0076 414.634375 417.986250 [silence]

sw3102A-ms98-a-0078 419.327125 420.664125 [silence]
sw3102A-ms98-a-0079 420.664125 422.421125 exactly
sw3102A-ms98-a-0080 422.421125 431.257500 i think if uh i would have went with the math i think i would have done a lot better because i was more interested and that's what i i knew that's what i wanted
sw3102A-ms98-a-0081 431.257500 442.021125 but uh i think a lot of kids that [vocalized-noise] hold off a year or two oh my gosh i would like to see the results on a study done i think they would do a lot better because they're more focused 
sw3102A-ms98-a-0082 442.021125 444.569375 they know exactly what they want to do
sw3102A-ms98-a-0083 444.569375 448.520875 [silence]
sw3102A-ms98-a-0084 448.520875 449.267625 uh-huh
