sw3101A-ms98-a-0010 17.438125 28.155500 and yeah it's we've only had it a couple of years but it's so much better than the other boat we had a an older trihold that was just horrible because_1 i mean God you felt every wave
sw3101A-ms98-a-0011 28.155500 35.975000 but the uh the invader is really neat i really like it it's got the bow up and the bow down and all that stuff so it's kind of fun
sw3101A-ms98-a-0012 35.975000 40.258125 yeah so we ski every weekend [laughter]
sw3101A-ms98-a-0013 40.258125 41.452625 [silence]
sw3101A-ms98-a-0014 41.452625 43.558500 yeah [laughter]
sw3101A-ms98-a-0015 43.558500 46.250250 we didn't i think i'd go nuts
sw3101A-ms98-a-0016 46.250250 47.659375 [silence]
sw3101A-ms98-a-0017 47.659375 48.550500 oh really
sw3101A-ms98-a-0018 48.550500 49.574375 [silence]
sw3101A-ms98-a-0019 49.574375 51.466875 oh
sw3101A-ms98-a-0020 51.466875 54.665250 [silence]
sw3101A-ms98-a-0021 54.665250 57.974375 yeah that would be difficult where did you see the boat
sw3101A-ms98-a-0022 57.974375 59.732375 [silence]
sw3101A-ms98-a-0023 59.732375 66.091500 oh well there's been one sitting up in Addison for the last few days that's really neat it's a Baja but it's huge
sw3101A-ms98-a-0024 66.091500 69.334875 i think it'd be more boat than i'd want right now
sw3101A-ms98-a-0025 69.334875 75.428625 huh well eventually my husband thinks that we are going to sell everything that we own and live on a boat in the Caribbean
sw3101A-ms98-a-0026 75.428625 80.386250 [laughter] yeah i think we'd kill each other [laughter]
sw3101A-ms98-a-0027 80.386250 82.290750 [laughter]
sw3101A-ms98-a-0028 82.290750 87.450250 well i think i could for awhile i do not know but yeah
sw3101A-ms98-a-0029 87.450250 100.106875 but i'd i mean i'd have to get away from him eventually but another friend of mine has said that he and his wife are going to do that and he said that they're just planning to take their bikes and then go into port every once in a while and
sw3101A-ms98-a-0030 100.106875 104.675125 say see you later and take off and he said that they thought they could keep their sanity that way
sw3101A-ms98-a-0031 104.675125 105.770250 [silence]
sw3101A-ms98-a-0032 105.770250 108.556125 yeah i do not know if i could live on a boat
sw3101A-ms98-a-0033 108.556125 115.924250 [laughter] well i know what could make you insane floating around in the middle of the Caribbean [laughter]
sw3101A-ms98-a-0034 115.924250 117.716250 exactly
sw3101A-ms98-a-0035 117.716250 128.181125 well that's another th[ing]- good thing about our boat is going out on the weekends at least we're forced to talk to each other and there's nothing to interrupt us and it's just so relaxing 
sw3101A-ms98-a-0036 128.181125 140.408125 so even if we do not ski but now that the water is warm enough we have been skiing a lot and my little seven year old nephew is coming next week so i guess i will have to teach him how to ski 
sw3101A-ms98-a-0037 140.408125 141.911625 [vocalized-noise]
sw3101A-ms98-a-0038 141.911625 144.974625 yeah i think that's about when i learned
sw3101A-ms98-a-0039 144.974625 146.908250 do you ski
sw3101A-ms98-a-0040 146.908250 149.343000 oh yeah do you have your own ski and everything
sw3101A-ms98-a-0041 149.343000 150.595625 [silence]
sw3101A-ms98-a-0042 150.595625 159.397125 oh yeah it's a lot of fun my husband has a wet suit so he can ski pretty much year around if he if he has the guts to [laughter]
sw3101A-ms98-a-0043 159.397125 160.732875 [silence]
sw3101A-ms98-a-0044 160.732875 173.185250 but uh it was really neat last weekend we were sitting out in the in the boat and a a a school of shad came bebopping across the water and he threw the line out and caught a fish on the first cast
sw3101A-ms98-a-0045 173.185250 178.464000 yeah that was really neat i had never seen the shad do that so that was pretty cool
sw3101A-ms98-a-0046 178.464000 180.506250 so anyway
sw3101A-ms98-a-0047 180.506250 183.194250 yeah i was amazed
sw3101A-ms98-a-0048 183.194250 186.091375 [silence]
sw3101A-ms98-a-0049 186.091375 188.544250 really did it have a cabin
sw3101A-ms98-a-0050 188.544250 189.897750 [silence]
sw3101A-ms98-a-0051 189.897750 191.416500 yeah
sw3101A-ms98-a-0052 191.416500 197.970000 [silence]
sw3101A-ms98-a-0053 197.970000 199.669500 oh really
sw3101A-ms98-a-0054 199.669500 200.880750 huh
sw3101A-ms98-a-0055 200.880750 203.191625 it must've been pretty big
sw3101A-ms98-a-0056 203.191625 204.403750 huh
sw3101A-ms98-a-0057 204.403750 207.809250 [silence]
sw3101A-ms98-a-0058 207.809250 209.991875 [laughter-how] much was it
sw3101A-ms98-a-0059 209.991875 211.456625 [laughter]
sw3101A-ms98-a-0060 211.456625 215.516750 oh my i wonder how old it was was it very old
sw3101A-ms98-a-0061 215.516750 217.943500 [silence]
sw3101A-ms98-a-0062 217.943500 220.875000 huh was it inboard outboard
sw3101A-ms98-a-0063 220.875000 222.773125 you don't know how big the engine was
sw3101A-ms98-a-0064 222.773125 225.433375 [silence]
sw3101A-ms98-a-0065 225.433375 229.212375 [laughter]
sw3101A-ms98-a-0066 229.212375 235.988375 yeah well ours will be paid off in ninety three and i will feel like i hit the lottery then i guess but
sw3101A-ms98-a-0067 235.988375 249.776875 it's pretty nice it's nice to have it's a good way to get away Kyle is afraid that he doesn't want me to to pull it by myself yet but the way our drive way is there's like a forty five degree turn so i do not think i could get it out even if i wanted to
sw3101A-ms98-a-0068 249.776875 251.284250 [silence]
sw3101A-ms98-a-0069 251.284250 263.536625 we go to Lewisville and but it's really nice i mean we've talked about getting the the slip so that if after work if i wanted to go out and play around in the boat i would have plenty of time because_1 now it does not get dark until nine o'clock but
sw3101A-ms98-a-0070 263.536625 272.326500 it's really nice having it in the garage because_1 then if we want to go to Whitney or you know Grapevine or any other place it's just there and we can load up and go
sw3101A-ms98-a-0071 272.326500 280.281875 so plus i don't have any idea how much slip rental is it probably probably get a little expensive i would think
sw3101A-ms98-a-0072 280.281875 287.420125 [silence]
sw3101A-ms98-a-0073 287.420125 288.734750 whoa
sw3101A-ms98-a-0074 288.734750 290.545500 i think i'll keep it in the garage
sw3101A-ms98-a-0075 290.545500 292.553375 [laughter]
sw3101A-ms98-a-0076 292.553375 294.386375 [laughter] that's outrageous
sw3101A-ms98-a-0077 294.386375 295.706500 [silence]
sw3101A-ms98-a-0078 295.706500 298.146875 just to have a place to park you boat
sw3101A-ms98-a-0079 298.146875 299.151875 [silence]
sw3101A-ms98-a-0080 299.151875 301.972500 yeah [laughter]
sw3101A-ms98-a-0081 301.972500 304.774000 [laughter] that's pretty wild
sw3101A-ms98-a-0082 304.774000 306.188375 [silence]
sw3101A-ms98-a-0083 306.188375 308.808125 oh that's true
sw3101A-ms98-a-0084 308.808125 315.318125 well that's what we were coming back from Arkansas i guess last October and there was a marina for sale
sw3101A-ms98-a-0085 315.318125 319.575625 and he said now that would be a fun job [laughter]
sw3101A-ms98-a-0086 319.575625 323.094000 but yeah i can probably do that for a while
sw3101A-ms98-a-0087 323.094000 325.171375 yeah
sw3101A-ms98-a-0088 325.171375 330.412375 yeah you know hang out the gone fishing sign [laughter]
sw3101A-ms98-a-0089 330.412375 331.861625 really
sw3101A-ms98-a-0090 331.861625 340.134375 i do not know a lot of people say boats are just a hole in the water that you pour money into but we've been real fortunate we have not had any problems
sw3101A-ms98-a-0091 340.134375 347.091125 so but Kyle's real good with the maintenance i think that that's real important so fortunately he knows what he is doing there
sw3101A-ms98-a-0092 347.091125 349.384125 [silence]
sw3101A-ms98-a-0093 349.384125 358.367500 well just the minor stuff uh we took it in for its hundred hour check up and all [laughter-that] stuff but you got to do stuff like that to keep the warranties good
sw3101A-ms98-a-0094 358.367500 360.812375 so that's fine i can live with that
sw3101A-ms98-a-0095 360.812375 362.607500 [silence]
sw3101A-ms98-a-0096 362.607500 368.737625 yeah [laughter] it's kind of like our only child now [laughter]
sw3101A-ms98-a-0097 368.737625 373.012125 [laughter] well hopefully someday you will get that dream boat an[d]-
sw3101A-ms98-a-0098 373.012125 374.429625 [silence]
sw3101A-ms98-a-0099 374.429625 379.136375 yeah really yeah you kind of need need them_1 to go hand in hand i guess
sw3101A-ms98-a-0100 379.136375 387.480000 yeah because_1 i mean i there's times you know even our weekends where we don't have time to go and it's sad because_1 you think God you are paying all that money for the boat and it's just sitting there
sw3101A-ms98-a-0101 387.480000 395.154750 so but it's well worth it when we do get to go and hopefully it will be good weather this weekend so we can go
sw3101A-ms98-a-0102 395.154750 396.655625 i hope so
sw3101A-ms98-a-0103 396.655625 404.410125 well i enjoyed talking to you okay maybe i will get you again sometime all right bye-bye
