sw3196A-ms98-a-0030 124.966250 132.175250 [laughter] it's funny that uh we've got a Sears card and we bought a washer and dryer on it four years ago
sw3196A-ms98-a-0031 132.175250 139.256500 and we still owe i mean i- i think like half [noise] of the amount that they cost in the first place
sw3196A-ms98-a-0032 139.256500 144.435000 it's just uh you know you just never never get get it out
sw3196A-ms98-a-0033 144.435000 149.939000 and uh that's that's real irritating to have [laughter]
sw3196A-ms98-a-0034 149.939000 157.870500 [silence]
sw3196A-ms98-a-0035 157.870500 159.207250 uh-huh
sw3196A-ms98-a-0036 159.207250 162.611125 [silence]
sw3196A-ms98-a-0037 162.611125 173.360000 well we did you know one time we wanted to buy a truck a used truck and so we went down to the bank and they said sure we'll give you a personal loan it was only a thousand dollars that we needed 
sw3196A-ms98-a-0038 173.360000 178.872125 for the truck and they said sure that's no problem but you know why don't we consolidate your bills
sw3196A-ms98-a-0039 178.872125 192.082250 and at the time we thought oh that would be great you know we could and it's gonna be a lower payment than it was for all of them_1 you only have to write one check a month not all those you never miss one or whatever and we did that but we didn't realize at the time
sw3196A-ms98-a-0040 192.082250 194.477125 uh until several months later that
sw3196A-ms98-a-0041 194.477125 198.731375 we we were real i mean this was four year three years ago we were
sw3196A-ms98-a-0042 198.731375 208.964125 pretty young and we were just kind of like well i guess that means these credit cards are closed and we didn't you know about six months later we realized we could use them_1 and so we charged them_1 all up again
sw3196A-ms98-a-0043 208.964125 219.042250 [laughter-yeah] so then we were not only paying those bills regular like we were before but also adding the lower payment problem [noise] so we were paying like twice
sw3196A-ms98-a-0044 219.042250 225.584875 um [noise] so we didn't ever made that mistake again luckily [noise] but uh we're
sw3196A-ms98-a-0045 225.584875 239.248250 definitely working on not doing that credit thing we just as a matter of fact this it's real interesting the subjects i get they always seem to be so pertinent but we just discussed this last night at church [laughter-talking] about debt and things like that i just it's so
sw3196A-ms98-a-0046 239.248250 245.249250 so alluring and uh so easy to get uh sometimes
