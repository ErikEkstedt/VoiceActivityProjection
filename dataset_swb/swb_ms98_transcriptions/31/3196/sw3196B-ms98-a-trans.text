sw3196B-ms98-a-0018 73.230375 79.841375 when it comes around to income tax time and you look at how much money you paid out just in interest all year you could really

sw3196B-ms98-a-0026 116.878750 120.454500 probably four or five hundred dollars you know that goes on
sw3196B-ms98-a-0027 120.454500 123.589375 at that point and then it seems like
sw3196B-ms98-a-0028 123.589375 127.081000 [noise] takes forever to pay that off [laughter]

sw3196B-ms98-a-0037 155.234625 160.180125 and the interest on the loan was cheaper [noise] than it was you know to just have that
