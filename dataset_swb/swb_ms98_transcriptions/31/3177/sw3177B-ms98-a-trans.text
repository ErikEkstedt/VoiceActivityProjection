sw3177B-ms98-a-0049 276.674875 290.048750 i always thought a straight percentage though would make a whole lot more sense because_1 some of the people who make the most they have so many quote deductions by the time they get through with their deductions they don't pay anything 
sw3177B-ms98-a-0050 290.048750 295.964250 and i question their i- i- i just think that they've made it almost a joke
