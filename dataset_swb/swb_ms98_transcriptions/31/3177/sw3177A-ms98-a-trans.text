sw3177A-ms98-a-0002 0.040000 8.368625 does tend to get [noise] talked about a lot and one of the things that i like to bring up when taxation comes about or the how they're collected 
sw3177A-ms98-a-0003 8.368625 16.167375 is uh you know government wants to control and and rightfully so in some instances what we do with our money it it does 
sw3177A-ms98-a-0004 16.167375 27.846250 enable them and those who have a good handle on our economic system to encourage investment by giving you a tax break if you invest properly you know things like that i can understand especially for people who are 
sw3177A-ms98-a-0005 27.846250 33.377000 uh young and getting into a knowledge of the economy and and
sw3177A-ms98-a-0006 33.377000 35.067750 [silence]
sw3177A-ms98-a-0007 35.067750 36.358000 well i think 
sw3177A-ms98-a-0008 36.358000 37.966375 [silence]
sw3177A-ms98-a-0009 37.966375 45.136000 i think years ago i think it used to i think the concept was good and i think that that those kind of things are all right
sw3177A-ms98-a-0010 45.136000 46.273375 i
sw3177A-ms98-a-0011 46.273375 49.638500 no not uh not near to the extent that it was 
sw3177A-ms98-a-0012 49.638500 53.124250 [silence]
sw3177A-ms98-a-0013 53.124250 54.234750 right
sw3177A-ms98-a-0014 54.234750 65.729750 [silence]
sw3177A-ms98-a-0015 65.729750 78.719750 right i usually use that as a preface to you know it's okay that the government used to do that or should do that as far as the good in[centive]- good incentive but since they're not doing it as well now i would be more in favor of 
sw3177A-ms98-a-0016 78.719750 91.352000 uh not taxing anything directly in other just do straight purchases in other words if if you want to put a tax on what you buy then revenues can be generated that way 
sw3177A-ms98-a-0017 91.352000 92.368500 people
sw3177A-ms98-a-0018 92.368500 94.078375 [silence]
sw3177A-ms98-a-0019 94.078375 95.271875 well 
sw3177A-ms98-a-0020 95.271875 96.666500 [silence]
sw3177A-ms98-a-0021 96.666500 106.415250 right but couldn't they live off of only that or if they took away the other taxes and built in what it took to make up the difference there 
sw3177A-ms98-a-0022 106.415250 113.108000 and the the rationale behind doing that is taxing only purchases if you notice most people tend to spend what they make
sw3177A-ms98-a-0023 113.108000 114.034500 [silence]
sw3177A-ms98-a-0024 114.034500 115.347000 and then some
sw3177A-ms98-a-0025 115.347000 118.528500 so then you'd have a tendency to be taxing
sw3177A-ms98-a-0026 118.528500 132.887750 uh pretty much across the board if you only made twenty to thirty thousand a year you'd probably only spend X amount of that you know a small portion of that on taxable goods you know you still wouldn't tax groceries and you still you know decide whether you want to tax housing 
sw3177A-ms98-a-0027 132.887750 135.544500 [silence]
sw3177A-ms98-a-0028 135.544500 140.674875 doing away with everything except for yeah all f[orms]- all forms of it including 
sw3177A-ms98-a-0029 140.674875 146.922250 [silence]
sw3177A-ms98-a-0030 146.922250 150.501500 well you'd have to up it to whatever fifteen percent
sw3177A-ms98-a-0031 150.501500 152.960750 yeah so if you took the money out of one
sw3177A-ms98-a-0032 152.960750 165.687000 [silence]
sw3177A-ms98-a-0033 165.687000 173.058375 well your problem in there is how do you get i mean you get people that don't report income now so if they don't report income then you wouldn't get that percentage 
sw3177A-ms98-a-0034 173.058375 174.176000 if if 
sw3177A-ms98-a-0035 174.176000 176.250500 [silence]
sw3177A-ms98-a-0036 176.250500 182.994875 well if if it's left in the hands of the grocer he doesn't care whether you know this guy giving him the money
sw3177A-ms98-a-0037 182.994875 188.044875 you know pays taxes or not but he's going to have to pay that percentage see what i'm saying 
sw3177A-ms98-a-0038 188.044875 193.820000 well when a guy comes in to you know he's got a hundred thousand dollars and he buys a hundred dollars worth of groceries 
sw3177A-ms98-a-0039 193.820000 196.604250 he pays fifteen percent tax let's say
sw3177A-ms98-a-0040 196.604250 201.606875 and if the poor guy comes in and pays a hundred dollars worth of groceries he pays fifteen percent tax 
sw3177A-ms98-a-0041 201.606875 206.511875 so both guys paid it because the grocer was in essence collecting it 
sw3177A-ms98-a-0042 206.511875 212.030250 and the hundred thousand dollar guy could not in any way hide what he purchased 
sw3177A-ms98-a-0043 212.030250 213.941750 because_1 the grocer doesn't want to hide it for him 
sw3177A-ms98-a-0044 213.941750 219.756375 whereas the hundred thousand dollar guy could tell the government he only made fifty thousand dollars and it's up to the government to prove him wrong
sw3177A-ms98-a-0045 219.756375 221.589000 [silence]
sw3177A-ms98-a-0046 221.589000 223.040000 see so i'm saying there's
sw3177A-ms98-a-0047 223.040000 237.517000 [silence]
sw3177A-ms98-a-0048 237.517000 239.728750 right [laughter] right 
sw3177A-ms98-a-0049 239.728750 241.732375 so you you tax
sw3177A-ms98-a-0050 241.732375 248.090500 yeah you tax per body and and then if you made more you got to keep more yeah that's a rational way to do it 
sw3177A-ms98-a-0051 248.090500 250.121125 [silence]
sw3177A-ms98-a-0052 250.121125 251.949625 yeah it it does seem
sw3177A-ms98-a-0053 251.949625 253.220000 [silence]
sw3177A-ms98-a-0054 253.220000 258.249875 it does seem fair it does take away all their ability to control which you know initially they 
sw3177A-ms98-a-0055 258.249875 261.655000 they had some good ideas but they don't seem to be following them_1 anymore 
sw3177A-ms98-a-0056 261.655000 263.373500 [silence]
sw3177A-ms98-a-0057 263.373500 264.506500 so
sw3177A-ms98-a-0058 264.506500 268.072125 [silence]
sw3177A-ms98-a-0059 268.072125 273.993000 that's true that's true not being an economy major i guess they'd never ask me anyway
sw3177A-ms98-a-0060 273.993000 276.165500 [noise] 
sw3177A-ms98-a-0061 276.165500 277.099250 oh
sw3177A-ms98-a-0062 277.099250 289.064000 [silence]
sw3177A-ms98-a-0063 289.064000 290.334750 right
