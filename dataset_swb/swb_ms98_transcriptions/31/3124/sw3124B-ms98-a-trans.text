sw3124B-ms98-a-0011 33.772500 43.737000 yeah it seemed like well you know last year was so strange having all those heavy heavy rains in April and this year we really didn't have heavy rains until May
sw3124B-ms98-a-0012 43.737000 56.058000 kind of like pushed the season back a little farther and now it's kind of lingering with kind of still a bit of humidity and it just tried to rain i mean i was coming in from my car just a few minutes ago and it was trying to rain which
sw3124B-ms98-a-0013 56.058000 65.100250 seems strange to have it raining in July normally we don't have too much uh humidity or or uh rainy time when it's past June

sw3124B-ms98-a-0022 111.116375 120.992875 you know so many times when you were trying to schedule outdoor activities you just never knew if it was going to be a go or not because of the weather it might rain on your little parade
sw3124B-ms98-a-0023 120.992875 130.287875 you know and here it was like pretty much you could schedule some activity outside anytime and you really didn't have too much of a chance of it getting rained out
sw3124B-ms98-a-0024 130.287875 133.873000 you could pretty much do whatever you wanted to do
sw3124B-ms98-a-0025 133.873000 136.686500 what part of Michigan were you living in

sw3124B-ms98-a-0038 173.644500 186.585875 well yeah i think a lot of people were uh leaving Michigan all about the time i came here in the early eighties and it seemed like it was almost a mass exodus you know the the little joke about will the last person leaving Michigan just turn out the light
sw3124B-ms98-a-0039 186.585875 191.817750 [laughter]
sw3124B-ms98-a-0040 191.817750 194.339375 [silence]
sw3124B-ms98-a-0041 194.339375 202.742750 well you know i i said i lived in uh the Pontiac i didn't live in the city of Pontiac i lived to the west of it uh
sw3124B-ms98-a-0042 202.742750 206.993625 i forget the the county but you know where all the lakes are around there
sw3124B-ms98-a-0043 206.993625 214.189625 i lived in an apartment complex on one of the lakes it was real close to where i worked it was only like four miles to work
sw3124B-ms98-a-0044 214.189625 224.917875 and it was wonderful being on the lake like that you know in the summer you feel like you're you know on a vacation all the time because you're right on a lake and everybody's you know out enjoying the water and such and
sw3124B-ms98-a-0045 224.917875 235.473750 uh in the winter time the lakes froze over you could still kind of go sledding and such out there but i thought it was just really neat to be out there on all those lakes there's lots of really small ones out there
sw3124B-ms98-a-0046 235.473750 242.386250 you know like maybe a mile two long that's enough to uh do some boating and was lots of fun
sw3124B-ms98-a-0047 242.386250 246.296500 [silence]
sw3124B-ms98-a-0048 246.296500 247.764125 um

sw3124B-ms98-a-0052 259.288750 266.842500 but it was yeah just lots of little lakes and of course it was you know a little more expensive to live on the lake but i just thought that was grand and i think a lot of people
sw3124B-ms98-a-0053 266.842500 279.277250 didn't really know that there were all those lakes out there unless you were from that area and kind of spotted them but there was quite a few lakes all around there it seemed like it was almost like you were living on an island there was so much water around where i was
sw3124B-ms98-a-0054 279.277250 287.360000 i said i wasn't close to downtown Pontiac i was way out to the west maybe four or five miles from from the city limits and it was really nice out there
sw3124B-ms98-a-0055 287.360000 295.656625 we had uh Pine Knob you know to go skiing and stuff so there were things around there really was pretty nice
sw3124B-ms98-a-0056 295.656625 298.529375 [silence]
sw3124B-ms98-a-0057 298.529375 305.560500 right right in the summertime they have musicals there and in the winter time they make snow and have a ski slope

sw3124B-ms98-a-0065 336.662750 348.773625 yeah yeah we used to have a Christmas time uh some of our relatives would come up from Alabama and i think most times we would have snow around Christmas and the kids when they were young would just go nuts
sw3124B-ms98-a-0066 348.773625 358.327250 you know because they were from Alabama where it never snowed and they just had a grand time watching the snow and getting out there and playing in it you know eternally
sw3124B-ms98-a-0067 358.327250 361.392500 [laughter]
sw3124B-ms98-a-0068 361.392500 365.402875 [silence]
sw3124B-ms98-a-0069 365.402875 371.366125 my first winter here i i came down in uh early eighty two and
sw3124B-ms98-a-0070 371.366125 381.747500 there was just a freak snowfall early one morning in December be[fore]- couple days before Christmas it lasted only a few hours like by noon it was gone
sw3124B-ms98-a-0071 381.747500 392.603000 and i remember getting up and somebody telling me hey better wait to go to work because the roads are all you know snow [laughter] and i was laughing going yeah right that's a good practical joke ha ha
sw3124B-ms98-a-0072 392.603000 401.018875 they said no really there's snow and there was but a very short time and the weather got warm so quick just melted it all away
sw3124B-ms98-a-0073 401.018875 404.895250 course when we get an ice storm that's not too much fun
sw3124B-ms98-a-0074 404.895250 409.192875 [silence]
sw3124B-ms98-a-0075 409.192875 412.817000 [laughter]

sw3124B-ms98-a-0081 432.218750 441.631250 oh yeah i think it's fun even the couple of ice storms i've gotten out there in my ski pants or something and still just been out and enjoying it a little bit i mean
sw3124B-ms98-a-0082 441.631250 449.610625 sometimes the ice is pretty bad but if you get on the the uh grassy kind of part you get a little bit of traction you can you know not slip and fall i mean first
