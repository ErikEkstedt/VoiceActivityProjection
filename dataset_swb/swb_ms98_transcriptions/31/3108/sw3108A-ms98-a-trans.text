sw3108A-ms98-a-0008 36.267875 41.557625 a really funny movie at the same time it had a
sw3108A-ms98-a-0009 41.557625 49.212250 story line about people trying to find themselves there were parts that were sad i mean it just ran the gamut of emotion 
sw3108A-ms98-a-0010 49.212250 52.564000 and but it was just enter[taining]- all around entertaining
sw3108A-ms98-a-0011 52.564000 54.175500 [silence]
sw3108A-ms98-a-0012 54.175500 57.682000 uh it's still on to the best of my knowledge
sw3108A-ms98-a-0013 57.682000 62.518000 oh uh it's i think it's less than two hours

sw3108A-ms98-a-0015 67.142000 69.505250 [laughter]
sw3108A-ms98-a-0016 69.505250 76.504625 [laughter-yes] but this one it was fairly long i i'm guessing probably an hour and forty five minutes maybe
sw3108A-ms98-a-0017 76.504625 83.416625 but excellent acting by Billy Crystal and Bruno Kirby uh
sw3108A-ms98-a-0018 83.416625 88.517250 who was the oh Jack Palance had an excellent part in there as the old cowboy

sw3108A-ms98-a-0050 210.719000 212.967000 [silence]
sw3108A-ms98-a-0051 212.967000 217.509375 it's uh he is a prosecuting attorney
sw3108A-ms98-a-0052 217.509375 224.523000 and uh another prosecutor in the a woman prosecutor in there is murdered
sw3108A-ms98-a-0053 224.523000 235.296500 and he's trying to find it and it's of course it's one of these with a twist where it looks like he's the one that wound up killing her so it's and it's an extremely long movie it's over two hours long
sw3108A-ms98-a-0054 235.296500 241.211625 which uh my wife en[joy]- she likes the suspense movies i enjoyed it to a degree
sw3108A-ms98-a-0055 241.211625 244.984250 [silence]
sw3108A-ms98-a-0056 244.984250 246.416750 [laughter-because] [laughter-it's]

sw3108A-ms98-a-0064 264.998375 275.453625 it's one that once you've seen it once and uh the suspense there is not really you really can't see it again so you know all the story and who did what and when it happened so
sw3108A-ms98-a-0065 275.453625 282.346000 once once you seen one that's a suspenseful type movie like that then it's it's not good for a second watching particularly
sw3108A-ms98-a-0066 282.346000 284.890000 at least i don't think so [noise]
sw3108A-ms98-a-0067 284.890000 288.101500 [silence]
