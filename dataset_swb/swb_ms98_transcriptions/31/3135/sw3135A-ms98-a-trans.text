sw3135A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.097500 [noise]
sw3135A-ms98-a-0002 1.097500 3.955000 [silence]
sw3135A-ms98-a-0003 3.955000 13.433875 oh yes i'm an old experienced hand i started back when it wasn't stylish to do that at all my daughter that's seventeen now
sw3135A-ms98-a-0004 13.433875 16.641375 i worked even when she was a baby
sw3135A-ms98-a-0005 16.641375 27.921250 and i had private care for both my daughters until they were two and then i was really lucky to have put them in a Methodist day school at Preston Hollow Methodist
sw3135A-ms98-a-0006 27.921250 37.717625 right off of Walnut Hill and Preston and it was a wonderful environment i i just wish all kids if they have to be put in day school could have that kind of place
sw3135A-ms98-a-0007 37.717625 41.363500 so it worked well how about you
sw3135A-ms98-a-0008 41.363500 44.857250 [silence]
sw3135A-ms98-a-0009 44.857250 46.489500 uh-huh
sw3135A-ms98-a-0010 46.489500 49.155625 [silence]
sw3135A-ms98-a-0011 49.155625 50.777625 uh-huh
sw3135A-ms98-a-0012 50.777625 51.783625 [silence]
sw3135A-ms98-a-0013 51.783625 53.232000 yeah
sw3135A-ms98-a-0014 53.232000 56.106875 [silence]
sw3135A-ms98-a-0015 56.106875 57.704500 uh-huh
sw3135A-ms98-a-0016 57.704500 58.996125 [silence]
sw3135A-ms98-a-0017 58.996125 66.485375 it's not hard to find anything that's part-time so many of the churches have really strong
sw3135A-ms98-a-0018 66.485375 76.873500 preschool and children's day out but it was a nightmare back when Cheryl was little and this is one of the few churches that did it there were a couple downtown Dallas
sw3135A-ms98-a-0019 76.873500 82.314250 but they were so [vocalized-noise] seemed cold and impersonal i just couldn't hack it
sw3135A-ms98-a-0020 82.314250 86.175125 and what i liked about Preston Hollow is that
sw3135A-ms98-a-0021 86.175125 101.144125 the people that were there when Cheryl was two which was fifteen years ago many of them are still there today so there was real continuity she went back as a teenager and these people that had changed her diapers when she was three were still there
sw3135A-ms98-a-0022 101.144125 109.512000 so it it was really neat but it was because they had a director that had always done it as a labor of love and she just kept good people and
sw3135A-ms98-a-0023 109.512000 118.244250 real cheerful place lots of arts and crafts and i'm really glad my kids had it because Plano schools do so little of that
sw3135A-ms98-a-0024 118.244250 125.801875 that if they hadn't had it before they hit first grade they were never going to have any art or music or any of the interpretive stuff
sw3135A-ms98-a-0025 125.801875 130.689375 [silence]
sw3135A-ms98-a-0026 130.689375 132.145000 uh-huh
sw3135A-ms98-a-0027 132.145000 137.034875 [silence]
sw3135A-ms98-a-0028 137.034875 150.032500 or pay for it after school our Emily's in the third grade over at Huffman and they started a pilot program where we can pay private tuition so that they can take French and music and art and
sw3135A-ms98-a-0029 150.032500 156.248125 you know i willingly did it but i thought this makes me angry this is something that ought to be in the schools
sw3135A-ms98-a-0030 156.248125 160.678875 rather than some of the other stuff they do yeah
sw3135A-ms98-a-0031 160.678875 174.332875 well that's the only way they're yeah that's the only way they're going to be able to do it and parents who really want their kids to have any humanities are going to have to do that so in some ways i think the the day schools do serve those purposes
sw3135A-ms98-a-0032 174.332875 181.198125 [silence]
sw3135A-ms98-a-0033 181.198125 188.556625 yeah yeah put the colors away [laughter] which is too bad
sw3135A-ms98-a-0034 188.556625 190.266875 uh-huh
sw3135A-ms98-a-0035 190.266875 191.799000 uh-huh
sw3135A-ms98-a-0036 191.799000 197.499375 [silence]
sw3135A-ms98-a-0037 197.499375 202.887000 until they were two yeah yeah both times they were at our house
sw3135A-ms98-a-0038 202.887000 216.521625 and that was hard too i i lucked out with really good people both times but i know so many people that are never able to find that and i'd practically give my paycheck away to do it so [laughter] ye[ah]-
sw3135A-ms98-a-0039 216.521625 217.528750 [silence]
sw3135A-ms98-a-0040 217.528750 218.751125 yeah
sw3135A-ms98-a-0041 218.751125 229.401500 well no she didn't live with us uh the first one was an elderly lady who was putting a a daughter through nursing school just purely on babysitting money
sw3135A-ms98-a-0042 229.401500 239.869375 and she kept Cheryl during the day and then did [vocalized-noise] more babysitting at night and she was neat because she was like the grandmother that my kids never had because both our parents are dead
sw3135A-ms98-a-0043 239.869375 249.599375 so that that was a plus from that respect as well and then with Emily it was a neighborhood friend that kept her so
sw3135A-ms98-a-0044 249.599375 256.908375 i just cannot fathom putting a little bitty baby in a commercial care center
sw3135A-ms98-a-0045 256.908375 265.874000 [silence]
sw3135A-ms98-a-0046 265.874000 267.412875 um-hum
sw3135A-ms98-a-0047 267.412875 270.998750 [silence]
sw3135A-ms98-a-0048 270.998750 272.492375 um-hum
sw3135A-ms98-a-0049 272.492375 280.876875 [silence]
sw3135A-ms98-a-0050 280.876875 284.227500 yeah oh that would be hard
sw3135A-ms98-a-0051 284.227500 285.254625 [silence]
sw3135A-ms98-a-0052 285.254625 294.757625 well they give a lot more leave i work at NCNB now and our benefits for maternal and and parental care and even for elderly people or
sw3135A-ms98-a-0053 294.757625 308.147625 are really expanding we have more options now then we did when i my kids were born with being able to take off full-time longer of you can phase your schedule in so that it's not full-time
sw3135A-ms98-a-0054 308.147625 320.199125 for up to six months it's really neat i've i've had a couple of assistants that came back just three days a week or they've you know whatever schedule they want from a pay standpoint 
sw3135A-ms98-a-0055 320.199125 331.315375 we try to work it with their hours and that helps because you don't have to just w[ean]- wean yourself cold turkey and say okay i never get to see my baby for eight hours a day again
sw3135A-ms98-a-0056 331.315375 343.075000 and the bank has a lot of programs now for child care referrals i've of course it's too late for me so i've i've not tried them to see how effective they are but
sw3135A-ms98-a-0057 343.075000 347.608250 i think we're finally beginning to make progress but just not very fast
sw3135A-ms98-a-0058 347.608250 352.685250 and for our age group it's too late too little too late
sw3135A-ms98-a-0059 352.685250 363.867125 but i [noise] i do think it's an area that needs to be looked at and improved because more of us are going to have to work two income families i think are here to stay
sw3135A-ms98-a-0060 363.867125 368.564750 [silence]
sw3135A-ms98-a-0061 368.564750 370.224375 uh-huh
sw3135A-ms98-a-0062 370.224375 372.514500 [silence]
sw3135A-ms98-a-0063 372.514500 374.976500 right yeah
sw3135A-ms98-a-0064 374.976500 376.991125 [silence]
sw3135A-ms98-a-0065 376.991125 378.850125 oh sure
sw3135A-ms98-a-0066 378.850125 389.048625 you retain employees and keep them longer that's that was the rationale they gave when they were giving us information about our Employee Assistance Programs that
sw3135A-ms98-a-0067 389.048625 397.407625 w[ell]- they want us to be happy and want us to be able to cope with trying to split ourselves in fifteen million pieces
sw3135A-ms98-a-0068 397.407625 403.736500 so i i hope it helps it seems to help the new mothers not have to come back full-time because that's hard
sw3135A-ms98-a-0069 403.736500 409.828375 [silence]
sw3135A-ms98-a-0070 409.828375 411.516875 uh-huh
sw3135A-ms98-a-0071 411.516875 413.143875 uh-huh
sw3135A-ms98-a-0072 413.143875 416.395375 [silence]
sw3135A-ms98-a-0073 416.395375 417.998250 uh-huh
sw3135A-ms98-a-0074 417.998250 423.452875 [silence]
sw3135A-ms98-a-0075 423.452875 433.248625 well in Plano though the problem is you find and this is what i found with Emily i from the time she started first grade i wanted her out in Plano area
sw3135A-ms98-a-0076 433.248625 440.009000 and i kept finding neighbors and friends and they'd move she ended up being in a different home every year 
sw3135A-ms98-a-0077 440.009000 449.612375 and i finally decided i didn't like that because it was traumatic to her to get so attached to a family and then have them move so this year i i tried KinderCare and then she's old enough to
