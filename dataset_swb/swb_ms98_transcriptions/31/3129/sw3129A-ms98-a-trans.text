sw3129A-ms98-a-0008 58.499375 65.471250 d[id]- d[id]- did you do the diagnosis o[r]- or was it just an assumption that that's probably the part that failed
sw3129A-ms98-a-0009 65.471250 72.992500 [silence]
sw3129A-ms98-a-0010 72.992500 74.942000 uh-huh

sw3129A-ms98-a-0013 97.037375 99.477500 [silence]
sw3129A-ms98-a-0014 99.477500 105.204500 yeah i know uh when working with the uh flashers
sw3129A-ms98-a-0015 105.204500 116.694750 there is uh usually a a special fuse that operates the flashers do you have a separate fuse for your high beam as opposed to your low beam
sw3129A-ms98-a-0016 116.694750 121.260500 [silence]
sw3129A-ms98-a-0017 121.260500 122.992000 diagram
sw3129A-ms98-a-0018 122.992000 131.476375 yeah i don't even know if my uh current cars have a separate fuse i know sometimes when you think there are uh
sw3129A-ms98-a-0019 131.476375 132.493250 [silence]
sw3129A-ms98-a-0020 132.493250 136.789500 things running uh while they're at the same unit like the li[ttle]- the headlamp
sw3129A-ms98-a-0021 136.789500 150.950625 you tend to think well there's one fuse operating the whole thing but sometimes the extra amperage that a high beam drives as opposed to a low beam uh requires uh the use of a of a maybe a higher fuse
sw3129A-ms98-a-0022 150.950625 152.989000 so that's a possibility
sw3129A-ms98-a-0023 152.989000 164.783250 [silence]

sw3129A-ms98-a-0041 313.489375 315.227375 oh no
sw3129A-ms98-a-0042 315.227375 325.485750 [silence]
sw3129A-ms98-a-0043 325.485750 331.201500 well ours wasn't within the last year i guess it's been within the last two years uh
sw3129A-ms98-a-0044 331.201500 342.961000 Judy has an Oldsmobile that we bought new and it's one with the uh electronic ignition and the computer controlled mixer and uh
sw3129A-ms98-a-0045 342.961000 349.457875 i don't know what else it all controls but the fuel mixture and cruise control and things of that sort
sw3129A-ms98-a-0046 349.457875 354.992750 and we found that the uh uh we were having two problems it was
sw3129A-ms98-a-0047 354.992750 365.665125 idling fast when you first started the engine to the point that uh we park on a on a hill under our car port and 
sw3129A-ms98-a-0048 365.665125 377.790250 when you first dropped it into geared it would immediately want to back up into the alley and knowing that you always had to keep your foot on the brake hard otherwise it would just wrench control away from you
sw3129A-ms98-a-0049 377.790250 390.492625 and the other problem Judy would have is occasionally she would uh be driving along uh decelerating like coming to a stop sign but not yet stopped at the stop sign and the engine would just quit
sw3129A-ms98-a-0050 390.492625 394.980000 so we took it back to the uh Oldsmobile place
sw3129A-ms98-a-0051 394.980000 407.490500 and asked them to check it out and at first they thought it was just a matter of timing so they adjusted timing and the problem didn't go away so we ended up taking it back again
sw3129A-ms98-a-0052 407.490500 411.971625 i don't know why they don't look at these things the first time around but the
sw3129A-ms98-a-0053 411.971625 420.486750 second time around they looked at their uh recall service and their uh service reports from region or headquarters whatever and
sw3129A-ms98-a-0054 420.486750 435.261750 and they had a description of the exact problem we were experiencing that apparently was a programming error in the uh computer control unit which fortunately they replaced under warranty because it was about a three hundred or three hundred and fifty dollar part
sw3129A-ms98-a-0055 435.261750 440.992000 and uh so once they replaced it then the the car seemed to work fine
sw3129A-ms98-a-0056 440.992000 450.430000 for a a considerable period of time and now it seems to be we don['t]- we're not experiencing the stalling but we're still experiencing a very uneven
