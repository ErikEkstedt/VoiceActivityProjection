sw3129B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.984750 [noise]
sw3129B-ms98-a-0002 0.984750 6.480500 well Tom just tonight i was working on my car out of necessity and i had uh
sw3129B-ms98-a-0003 6.480500 17.252250 uh had a long age old problem of my bright lights not working uh this is the type of uh switch where you flip the the lever the turn signal on the column
sw3129B-ms98-a-0004 17.252250 23.469375 and when i would uh put it in the bright light position the lights would go out completely
sw3129B-ms98-a-0005 23.469375 27.278625 which is even worse than them just not getting bright [laughter]
sw3129B-ms98-a-0006 27.278625 34.489000 and i had to presume that it was the switch and uh this is uh an older car it's a seventy two MG
sw3129B-ms98-a-0007 34.489000 47.968125 so i had to mail order the part uh which i had done and tonight i went out and uh at least hooked in the new part only to discover that that apparently is not the problem it's not in the switch because it does the same thing with the new switch
sw3129B-ms98-a-0008 47.968125 58.477000 so i'll be faced with having to return that product and uh and hoping that uh you know that they will accept it although it's been removed from the box it's obviously not been really used
sw3129B-ms98-a-0009 58.477000 64.458125 [silence]
sw3129B-ms98-a-0010 64.458125 67.480250 uh i had
sw3129B-ms98-a-0011 67.480250 73.690250 done what diagnosis i could primarily by looking at a wiring diagram that i did have of the car
sw3129B-ms98-a-0012 73.690250 82.675500 and uh pretty much decided that that had to be the problem i talked to one mechanic about it and he suspected the switch also
sw3129B-ms98-a-0013 82.675500 95.958000 uh but i've not you know i really don't know what the problem might be it it the other switch could be the main switch itself uh that turns the lights on or off which is on the dashboard
sw3129B-ms98-a-0014 95.958000 99.457125 uh it might be tied into the equation somehow
sw3129B-ms98-a-0015 99.457125 100.984500 but uh
sw3129B-ms98-a-0016 100.984500 113.271125 [silence]
sw3129B-ms98-a-0017 113.271125 119.731125 i i don't know i should look at that i don't remember seeing one in the uh
sw3129B-ms98-a-0018 119.731125 124.456875 in the the diagram but i'll have to go back and look at that
sw3129B-ms98-a-0019 124.456875 136.250500 [silence]
sw3129B-ms98-a-0020 136.250500 137.669750 uh-huh
sw3129B-ms98-a-0021 137.669750 149.991000 [silence]
sw3129B-ms98-a-0022 149.991000 152.305000 yeah that's a good idea
sw3129B-ms98-a-0023 152.305000 153.485125 [silence]
sw3129B-ms98-a-0024 153.485125 165.486250 what i've typically found when that uh companies are pretty good about accepting returns on products like that when they're not needed after all and i hope that that's the case this time
sw3129B-ms98-a-0025 165.486250 170.486125 [silence]
sw3129B-ms98-a-0026 170.486125 174.645375 right exactly it's out of uh Kansas
sw3129B-ms98-a-0027 174.645375 175.993000 somewhere
sw3129B-ms98-a-0028 175.993000 177.758875 [silence]
sw3129B-ms98-a-0029 177.758875 189.296625 no it's not i also got a piece of chrome for the the hood that they had indicated was the right part for this car but uh it is not either it's uh obviously doesn't quite fit
sw3129B-ms98-a-0030 189.296625 191.508250 so it must be for a different year
sw3129B-ms98-a-0031 191.508250 194.274500 so i'll have to try to return that as well
sw3129B-ms98-a-0032 194.274500 200.990875 [silence]
sw3129B-ms98-a-0033 200.990875 207.940250 well i had one person that i used for years and years on this car because i've owned this car since it was new
sw3129B-ms98-a-0034 207.940250 215.488625 and uh but it's over like in the Brook Hollow industrial district down on Stemmons and Inwood area
sw3129B-ms98-a-0035 215.488625 229.990750 and i hadn't used him for some years and the last time i called him back it turned out that he had further specialized instead of uh all import cars he has narrowed it down to where he only works on uh German cars and
sw3129B-ms98-a-0036 229.990750 231.499375 [silence]
sw3129B-ms98-a-0037 231.499375 241.236000 German cars [laughter] i'm not sure that he works on much else at all but he doesn't work on British cars any more and gave me the name of somebody else to take a look at it
sw3129B-ms98-a-0038 241.236000 252.727875 so uh uh i may have to check with that person as it turns out that one that shop is near where i now work so i'll uh i should be able to take it in and check that part out
sw3129B-ms98-a-0039 252.727875 257.734625 i've not had t[o]- to exchange any other parts recently uh
sw3129B-ms98-a-0040 257.734625 265.697125 because they were defective now i've had had pretty good luck i just however did uh have to get a
sw3129B-ms98-a-0041 265.697125 270.734500 a uh one of these jam box portable dual cassette players
sw3129B-ms98-a-0042 270.734500 283.726750 uh repaired i'd purchased it at at Sam's and i had assumed that it had a ninety day warranty and i should have checked more carefully and and done a better job of saving the receipt
sw3129B-ms98-a-0043 283.726750 295.481625 because uh i didn't take it in right away and let a whole year go by uh some of the buttons didn't work right where you had to actually physically hold them down to get it to record or to play
sw3129B-ms98-a-0044 295.481625 308.695125 and as it turned out it had a full year's warranty and i could have gotten it repaired for free but i i had to to take it in while it was in the shop i ended up finding the receipt that i thought had long since been lost
sw3129B-ms98-a-0045 308.695125 319.935750 uh but it didn't do me any good because i had i had missed the window by about a week or [laughter-two] so i didn't even i didn't really uh even bring it up when i went in to pick it up
sw3129B-ms98-a-0046 319.935750 326.395875 but uh that's really my only experience in the past year where i've had to take a product back because of a defect
sw3129B-ms98-a-0047 326.395875 376.418000 [silence]
sw3129B-ms98-a-0048 376.418000 378.977250 good grief
sw3129B-ms98-a-0049 378.977250 387.911875 [silence]
sw3129B-ms98-a-0050 387.911875 389.446125 uh-huh
sw3129B-ms98-a-0051 389.446125 391.439250 [laughter]
sw3129B-ms98-a-0052 391.439250 425.975875 [silence]
sw3129B-ms98-a-0053 425.975875 427.998125 huh
sw3129B-ms98-a-0054 427.998125 433.991000 [silence]
