sw3130B-ms98-a-0006 16.824625 28.632875 really we have recently started uh a bin program here in Plano where uh used to be we we put all of our trash in green bags and the trash men came out twice a week and picked up
sw3130B-ms98-a-0007 28.632875 32.782500 and now they have uh these large green containers
sw3130B-ms98-a-0008 32.782500 44.259500 and you have to put your trash that you don't recycle in there and then they haven't started curbside recycling yet but they're but they're planning on doing it very soon apparently the trucks that they had
sw3130B-ms98-a-0009 44.259500 57.277375 um lined up they needed the parts for Saudi Arabia [laughter] and so that put off the program for a while but uh do you recycle

sw3130B-ms98-a-0015 66.493125 76.985375 [noise] oh well that's great well that's the way we started too my daughter was going to Camp Goddard um which is through the Plano school system you know in the fall
sw3130B-ms98-a-0016 76.985375 88.337125 couple of years ago and she had to earn money for it and she was too young to babysit so that's how she started she started recycling cans and from there we now recycle glass and newspapers
sw3130B-ms98-a-0017 88.337125 94.190375 and uh aluminum cans and plastics uh-huh uh-huh
sw3130B-ms98-a-0018 94.190375 99.973375 [silence]
sw3130B-ms98-a-0019 99.973375 107.497250 no th[e]- the only thing we get paid for are the aluminum cans um the rest of it we just do because
sw3130B-ms98-a-0020 107.497250 108.448625 [laughter]
sw3130B-ms98-a-0021 108.448625 122.748125 my husband has become hooked on recycling and so you know we don't get paid for that but that's okay you know th[at]- it's it's not that much of a bother really you just have to rinse out your bottles or whatever and we use a lot of two liter bottles
sw3130B-ms98-a-0022 122.748125 128.246000 um and like milk cartons and things like that it's amazing how much plastic you generate
sw3130B-ms98-a-0023 128.246000 130.504875 [silence]
sw3130B-ms98-a-0024 130.504875 132.685375 yeah yeah

sw3130B-ms98-a-0027 139.783500 143.712625 [silence]
sw3130B-ms98-a-0028 143.712625 148.989500 yeah it really is well all that stuff and how much how much we have reduced 
sw3130B-ms98-a-0029 148.989500 153.354250 our waste you know that we we're generating a week um
sw3130B-ms98-a-0030 153.354250 165.996375 i know our neighbors when we first went to this bin program said oh there's no way you know we're going to have to have pickup twice a week they were real upset but they weren't picking they were only picking up once a week and we said to them if you recycle 
sw3130B-ms98-a-0031 165.996375 179.945250 you['ll]- you'll you know [vocalized-noise] you'll go two weeks without having to put out the green container and uh it's it's really amazing the other thing he does that my husband is a real stickler about is we don't collect our grass clippings 
sw3130B-ms98-a-0032 179.945250 185.284000 no he he got a little mulcher thing it's just a little attachment for the lawn mower
sw3130B-ms98-a-0033 185.284000 197.504875 and we mow once a week you know no no more often then that and then the clippings just get mulched up and then just lay on the on on the um on the lawn
sw3130B-ms98-a-0034 197.504875 205.528000 and it's amazing it's amazing we don't collect any of that and that that has cut down a lot in what we throw out
sw3130B-ms98-a-0035 205.528000 211.993750 [silence]
sw3130B-ms98-a-0036 211.993750 213.517625 uh-huh
sw3130B-ms98-a-0037 213.517625 216.782125 [silence]
sw3130B-ms98-a-0038 216.782125 218.219375 yeah
sw3130B-ms98-a-0039 218.219375 219.493625 [silence]
sw3130B-ms98-a-0040 219.493625 221.290375 yeah
sw3130B-ms98-a-0041 221.290375 224.846250 sure it does sure it does it really does and it
sw3130B-ms98-a-0042 224.846250 237.477500 actually they say that you're wasting fertilizer if you're not uh if you're catching your grass clippings that that's that much fertilizer you have to use because it does fertilize the lawn it's amazing
sw3130B-ms98-a-0043 237.477500 239.472250 yeah yeah
sw3130B-ms98-a-0044 239.472250 241.493500 [silence]
sw3130B-ms98-a-0045 241.493500 245.762875 uh-huh that's true that's true that's true
sw3130B-ms98-a-0046 245.762875 253.752500 well i i really think you're going to get hooked on plastics and paper [laughter] before you know it [laughter]
sw3130B-ms98-a-0047 253.752500 260.465625 it's it's really not that much trouble we keep a large plastic uh just a you know a garbage bag in the garage
sw3130B-ms98-a-0048 260.465625 275.198500 and as soon as we use something you know we crush it up and put it out there and then you know every few weeks we have recycling a recycling center like near Wal-Mart they're they have the containers that you can just go over there and drop it in and it's really no trouble
sw3130B-ms98-a-0049 275.198500 279.489250 and uh i feel like at least we're doing something
sw3130B-ms98-a-0050 279.489250 285.764125 you know uh um i read a book one time or a m[agazine]- a magazine article and they said something about how
sw3130B-ms98-a-0051 285.764125 299.195250 you don't realize even just your small contribution it seems like a small contribution but it's not if everyone were to recycle just their newspapers they would s[ave]- save thousands and thousands of trees a day
sw3130B-ms98-a-0052 299.195250 308.746875 a day just from not throwing out your newspapers and uh when you read that you think well gee maybe it is a big deal you know
sw3130B-ms98-a-0053 308.746875 312.495125 [silence]
sw3130B-ms98-a-0054 312.495125 313.994875 uh-huh
sw3130B-ms98-a-0055 313.994875 315.993500 uh-huh

sw3130B-ms98-a-0060 323.268250 327.784625 yeah yeah yeah and that's and that's really not necessary
sw3130B-ms98-a-0061 327.784625 338.633750 it really isn't if everybody would do just a little bit it would make a big difference it would make a huge impact so i'm excited about the recycling program in Plano i i can't wait for them to get it started
sw3130B-ms98-a-0062 338.633750 348.493875 um because th[at]- it'll be that much easier for us you know like i said now we have to take it over to to Wal-Mart it would be real nice if they just came by and just picked it up um 
sw3130B-ms98-a-0063 348.493875 349.980375 [silence]
sw3130B-ms98-a-0064 349.980375 352.752000 now what what do they pick up it's just
