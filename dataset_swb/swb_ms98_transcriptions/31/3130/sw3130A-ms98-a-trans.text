sw3130A-ms98-a-0053 308.314625 312.717250 what what makes me sick is is when they show the the dump sites
sw3130A-ms98-a-0054 312.717250 324.237500 you know and and how big they are or like in New York the barges that that go up and down the the river and they don't have any place to put it and it just floats in the and it's like ugh
sw3130A-ms98-a-0055 324.237500 327.291875 [silence]

sw3130A-ms98-a-0073 427.197875 437.751250 they take them all outside and i put them in a big bag anyway and then they dump the bag out and then they crush them so that's their activity thing they go out there and crush so
