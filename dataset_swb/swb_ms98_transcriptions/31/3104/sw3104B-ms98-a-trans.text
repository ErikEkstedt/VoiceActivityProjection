sw3104B-ms98-a-0040 278.986375 292.185125 yes i went uh four years undergrad at University of Nebraska at Lincoln because Lincoln is where where my parents lived and there really
sw3104B-ms98-a-0041 292.185125 298.551125 there really wasn't a choice i mean the finances uh dictated that you had to go there
sw3104B-ms98-a-0042 298.551125 312.592500 i kind of i am not going to say i resent it but i was well one of the national merit scholarship qualifying and you know one of the Rhodes Scholars kids and the whole bit um 
sw3104B-ms98-a-0043 312.592500 325.799000 my parents didn't even discuss with me going to college out of state or anyplace else and i just knew that the finances you know would not support it if i had known
sw3104B-ms98-a-0044 325.799000 330.623375 how not i'm not going to say easy but how
sw3104B-ms98-a-0045 330.623375 334.494125 much less difficult than i thought it would be to get a uh
sw3104B-ms98-a-0046 334.494125 339.085500 scholarship [vocalized-noise] to go anyplace else i think that i 
sw3104B-ms98-a-0047 339.085500 352.099375 would definitely you know have gone now when i finished there then i got a scholarship to go to the Harvard University in Boston and that was uh i think that was probably one of the best things that had ever happened i mean i was
sw3104B-ms98-a-0048 352.099375 364.651000 taken out of my element you know the the the homogeneous Midwest which is a lovely place to grow up and put into someplace else where people thought differently looked differently sounded differently uh
sw3104B-ms98-a-0049 364.651000 371.712375 different life style and i think it was probably one of the best things that ever happened to me

sw3104B-ms98-a-0052 397.320250 406.109750 you know them getting an education they really need a a you know a socialization away from what they are raised in especially if you lived a pretty insular community and uh
