sw3104A-ms98-a-0028 64.045000 67.789125 it's a problem for any child and you take one that's used to being
sw3104A-ms98-a-0029 67.789125 72.691750 uh busy being having something to do all the time it makes a big difference

sw3104A-ms98-a-0038 85.300000 93.410250 no our last daughter she didn't want to go to school she's uh but she's married now they built a home just a couple miles from us and
sw3104A-ms98-a-0039 93.410250 94.711875 [silence]
sw3104A-ms98-a-0040 94.711875 108.012875 well we didn't do it right all the time [laughter] with our first boy we persuaded him to start here and i do not always think you should try to make them stay closer to home i think the main thing is to uh 
sw3104A-ms98-a-0041 108.012875 117.432500 right now i feel the main thing is to look at what they're interested in uh and take what they're interested in and then then start looking for schools
sw3104A-ms98-a-0042 117.432500 122.014000 [silence]
sw3104A-ms98-a-0043 122.014000 124.652000 no not necessarily
sw3104A-ms98-a-0044 124.652000 134.997750 and but like our oldest boy i think he would have he wanted to go to Embrey Reynold[s]- Riddle and we talked him into going local here first 
sw3104A-ms98-a-0045 134.997750 146.161125 and he only went a few months and then transferred to Pittsburgh he went to aeronautical uh [noise] oh just learning to work on engines and that 
sw3104A-ms98-a-0046 146.161125 156.648125 uh it has to do with airplanes and everything which is what his whole life is [laughter] and i really wish we would have let him go where he wanted to go originally
sw3104A-ms98-a-0047 156.648125 169.492625 and he would probably be flying is what he would be doing uh but but right now of course he's he's working for Pratt and Whitney in Connecticut and they build and rebuild uh jet engines
sw3104A-ms98-a-0048 169.492625 172.511000 [silence]
sw3104A-ms98-a-0049 172.511000 186.465375 uh the other ones uh the second one she chose we let her go where she wanted to uh we didn't want her to go but she went to Erie to Gannan University uh or Gannan College i'm not sure which it is college i guess
sw3104A-ms98-a-0050 186.465375 197.848125 uh she went there two years and it was more expensive and she soon realized you know even though she didn't like Clarion she came back and finished at Clarion
sw3104A-ms98-a-0051 197.848125 204.390875 because it uh saved her quite a bit of money and she got really the same basic education that she wanted
sw3104A-ms98-a-0052 204.390875 212.639125 and our other uh two boys they went to Clarion also and uh did very well there
sw3104A-ms98-a-0053 212.639125 215.277250 and they've all really got uh
sw3104A-ms98-a-0054 215.277250 217.949500 they've all really got really good jobs
sw3104A-ms98-a-0055 217.949500 219.453500 and uh
sw3104A-ms98-a-0056 219.453500 220.717375 [silence]
sw3104A-ms98-a-0057 220.717375 222.187500 uh-huh
sw3104A-ms98-a-0058 222.187500 224.692375 [silence]
sw3104A-ms98-a-0059 224.692375 234.881000 uh yeah they kind of had that they just expected to go Daphne never went she always said she would never go to college
sw3104A-ms98-a-0060 234.881000 245.095750 she said i- i always thought she'd change her mind you know but she didn't and there's nothing wrong with that you know if college isn't for everybody
sw3104A-ms98-a-0061 245.095750 252.221625 but uh it it does make a difference in your pay wage income i think it's what they want out of life
sw3104A-ms98-a-0062 252.221625 255.159375 because if they get an education
sw3104A-ms98-a-0063 255.159375 258.502000 and are willing to go where the jobs are
sw3104A-ms98-a-0064 258.502000 261.651000 they can make a you know a much better income
sw3104A-ms98-a-0065 261.651000 268.174000 like my kids they're all making more than my husband was making when he retired from the state
sw3104A-ms98-a-0066 268.174000 271.184250 you know that boggles my mind

sw3104A-ms98-a-0114 408.520375 410.660625 it's quite a bit different
sw3104A-ms98-a-0115 410.660625 416.285000 see that's the way we are we're more of a rural type of a area
sw3104A-ms98-a-0116 416.285000 418.625500 and it does make a difference
sw3104A-ms98-a-0117 418.625500 424.137625 i they say you shouldn't look at the expense of the college when you are looking
sw3104A-ms98-a-0118 424.137625 430.207625 yeah not really because they say a lot of times you -[c]an get more help 
sw3104A-ms98-a-0119 430.207625 432.528375 with a more expensive college
sw3104A-ms98-a-0120 432.528375 437.720750 and so in the long run if it's really what they want
sw3104A-ms98-a-0121 437.720750 445.737000 you know they're better off now our children all pretty much borrowed for their school uh we we did all we could
sw3104A-ms98-a-0122 445.737000 449.741625 but they pretty much had to borrow a lot of their money to go
