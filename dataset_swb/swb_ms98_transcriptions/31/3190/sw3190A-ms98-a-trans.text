sw3190A-ms98-a-0016 43.621375 48.996125 so that wouldn't be a good spot to go on a vacation now if you were a skier
sw3190A-ms98-a-0017 48.996125 52.310625 [silence]
sw3190A-ms98-a-0018 52.310625 53.597375 uh-huh

sw3190A-ms98-a-0022 64.912500 66.356625 uh-huh
sw3190A-ms98-a-0023 66.356625 67.500500 [silence]

sw3190A-ms98-a-0025 68.866000 70.167125 [silence]
sw3190A-ms98-a-0026 70.167125 71.809625 oh
sw3190A-ms98-a-0027 71.809625 80.201625 well we went on a family cruise last year on the Premier Family Cruise Line [noise] and then we went to Disney it was all part of the package
sw3190A-ms98-a-0028 80.201625 87.605125 and on the cruise ship they had Mickey and Minnie and Chip and Dale and Goofy and Donald Duck and it was really oriented toward little kids
sw3190A-ms98-a-0029 87.605125 94.339875 so the kids could eat with Chip and Dale you know and you know it's just a lot of fun
sw3190A-ms98-a-0030 94.339875 105.212625 so then we were on the cruise for three days in the Bahamas and then landed at Cape Canaveral and then drove over to Orlando and spent four days at Disney
sw3190A-ms98-a-0031 105.212625 106.267250 [silence]
sw3190A-ms98-a-0032 106.267250 108.863500 yes that was the way to travel

sw3190A-ms98-a-0035 111.990250 117.902250 yes that's right that's right and kids are really cheaper too
sw3190A-ms98-a-0036 117.902250 131.192250 we really lucked out because the ship we were supposed to be on developed engine trouble two days before our cruise so they said we could either cancel reschedule or take whatever was available so we took whatever was available
sw3190A-ms98-a-0037 131.192250 141.316750 and we left a day early [noise] and they put us up at the Cocoa Beach Hilton and the ship that was available the only uh rooms that hadn't been booked were the suites
sw3190A-ms98-a-0038 141.316750 146.096000 so we got the suites at the same price as a regular cabin
sw3190A-ms98-a-0039 146.096000 147.652625 [noise] yeah
sw3190A-ms98-a-0040 147.652625 156.236000 so then our cruise was actually extended a day and our Disney was extended a day so we turned a seven day trip into ten
sw3190A-ms98-a-0041 156.236000 158.526125 and they paid for everything
sw3190A-ms98-a-0042 158.526125 160.440875 yes
sw3190A-ms98-a-0043 160.440875 163.462375 so that was a wonderful vacation
