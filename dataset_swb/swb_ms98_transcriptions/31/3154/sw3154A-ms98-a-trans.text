sw3154A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.486625 [noise]
sw3154A-ms98-a-0002 1.486625 22.054000 [silence]
sw3154A-ms98-a-0003 22.054000 27.026000 are are you in the part of town where uh they have gotten into the
sw3154A-ms98-a-0004 27.026000 29.518250 other containers yet for recycling
sw3154A-ms98-a-0005 29.518250 32.037000 [silence]
sw3154A-ms98-a-0006 32.037000 43.900750 well maybe they don't i i know that was supposed to be in May and i couldn't tell whether some parts of town had started it or if it was just everybody was was waiting for the delivery of whatever those containers were
sw3154A-ms98-a-0007 43.900750 51.402625 [silence]
sw3154A-ms98-a-0008 51.402625 52.757125 yeah the
sw3154A-ms98-a-0009 52.757125 61.727625 that's going to be interesting because it's uh [noise] we've gotten so convenient and conventional in trash disposal which is 
sw3154A-ms98-a-0010 61.727625 68.083250 uh i look at our big green containers and i say well they work fine and i keep mine outside the garage
sw3154A-ms98-a-0011 68.083250 73.777625 so that i don't have any odors but it's clearly a place where uh
sw3154A-ms98-a-0012 73.777625 86.795750 uh it'll be interesting to see how well that works and i am i'm glad the community is doing it uh it's one of those things that kind of has to be forced on people
sw3154A-ms98-a-0013 86.795750 97.606625 uh i don't know if where you grew up in your what you saw back uh years ago but for me the thing that strikes me is i uh
sw3154A-ms98-a-0014 97.606625 105.047625 growing up in rural South Dakota where hey the farmers brought their eggs to town and the local hatchery
sw3154A-ms98-a-0015 105.047625 108.017375 would candle them and package them
sw3154A-ms98-a-0016 108.017375 111.574375 is that uh in the fifties
sw3154A-ms98-a-0017 111.574375 114.069250 uh you could say we had
sw3154A-ms98-a-0018 114.069250 118.010625 the recycling going on then that we should have now
sw3154A-ms98-a-0019 118.010625 121.746625 which was all the milk bottles were glass and you got
sw3154A-ms98-a-0020 121.746625 129.840625 a nickel or dime which in that time was a lot of money when you returned them pop bottles all had a deposit on them
sw3154A-ms98-a-0021 129.840625 134.472750 [silence]
sw3154A-ms98-a-0022 134.472750 135.492250 oh
sw3154A-ms98-a-0023 135.492250 138.177250 [silence]
sw3154A-ms98-a-0024 138.177250 139.468875 uh-huh
sw3154A-ms98-a-0025 139.468875 140.785750 [silence]
sw3154A-ms98-a-0026 140.785750 141.748625 yeah
sw3154A-ms98-a-0027 141.748625 148.477375 [silence]
sw3154A-ms98-a-0028 148.477375 149.540875 yeah
sw3154A-ms98-a-0029 149.540875 151.614125 [silence]
sw3154A-ms98-a-0030 151.614125 153.588375 so uh you know i look back at
sw3154A-ms98-a-0031 153.588375 155.542750 at uh my
sw3154A-ms98-a-0032 155.542750 167.832875 childhood and i'd say you know [noise] they were doing things then that we should be doing now and so it doesn't bother me at all that we're we're uh kind of starting to put the pressure on people to get away from all this
sw3154A-ms98-a-0033 167.832875 172.215375 uh throwaway society that got developed in the sixties and seventies
sw3154A-ms98-a-0034 172.215375 180.484875 [silence]
sw3154A-ms98-a-0035 180.484875 181.757500 yeah
sw3154A-ms98-a-0036 181.757500 201.285750 [silence]
sw3154A-ms98-a-0037 201.285750 203.010875 uh-huh
sw3154A-ms98-a-0038 203.010875 207.193375 [silence]
sw3154A-ms98-a-0039 207.193375 212.358875 yeah well i'll have to say i'm i'm the only one i'm good at at this point is the newspaper
sw3154A-ms98-a-0040 212.358875 216.551000 uh taking that to the Boy Scouts and my aluminum cans
sw3154A-ms98-a-0041 216.551000 220.952500 uh getting rid of those but on the plastic i have uh
sw3154A-ms98-a-0042 220.952500 226.861750 i don't have any habits there yet and i'm guess i'm waiting for the city to to push me in that direction but
sw3154A-ms98-a-0043 226.861750 228.811750 [silence]
sw3154A-ms98-a-0044 228.811750 231.762125 but it just seems like on the larger scale that
sw3154A-ms98-a-0045 231.762125 237.715500 you know the we always talk about in our society is that economic strife things and i think if uh
sw3154A-ms98-a-0046 237.715500 248.178250 if we just start to put you know the nickel deposit on things like uh was the case years ago that uh it would have more immediate effect
sw3154A-ms98-a-0047 248.178250 258.561875 uh than because i remember searching ditches for beer bottles because they were worth money and it seems like beer drinkers are among the worst for throwing things out the window and so
sw3154A-ms98-a-0048 258.561875 260.867250 outside my little town
sw3154A-ms98-a-0049 260.867250 265.721125 we would uh go out and look for long neck beer bottle because they were worth something 
sw3154A-ms98-a-0050 265.721125 273.773125 [silence]
sw3154A-ms98-a-0051 273.773125 274.789375 yeah
sw3154A-ms98-a-0052 274.789375 276.856500 [silence]
sw3154A-ms98-a-0053 276.856500 281.396500 i well that's interesting because they're back to glass you're saying
sw3154A-ms98-a-0054 281.396500 287.115125 [silence]
sw3154A-ms98-a-0055 287.115125 288.874250 uh-huh
sw3154A-ms98-a-0056 288.874250 290.106500 yeah
sw3154A-ms98-a-0057 290.106500 304.572125 [silence]
sw3154A-ms98-a-0058 304.572125 306.053000 uh-huh
sw3154A-ms98-a-0059 306.053000 308.696625 the carton the paper carton
sw3154A-ms98-a-0060 308.696625 311.108875 [silence]
sw3154A-ms98-a-0061 311.108875 312.472500 yeah
sw3154A-ms98-a-0062 312.472500 323.826250 well i mean the y[ou]- you really look and say a lot of the things we need to do we were doing and we had all the mechanisms in place with the fold up paper cartons the wood
sw3154A-ms98-a-0063 323.826250 332.215625 uh racks which now basically you could turn them into the plastic ones that would hold uh twenty four bottles and
sw3154A-ms98-a-0064 332.215625 334.061875 and uh
sw3154A-ms98-a-0065 334.061875 341.742125 uh i'm not really say going back to good old days but certainly we were doing things the way we think we should [laughter-do] them now
sw3154A-ms98-a-0066 341.742125 350.570625 well it will be interesting to see how over the next year this all works out because like on the uh grass i'm i know your husband uh
sw3154A-ms98-a-0067 350.570625 352.528750 doesn't really like the paper sacks
sw3154A-ms98-a-0068 352.528750 357.732250 [silence]
sw3154A-ms98-a-0069 357.732250 361.206875 yeah i'm the i'm the same way because otherwise
sw3154A-ms98-a-0070 361.206875 367.036000 uh oh i'm i generally listen to Neal Sperry on Saturdays and Neal uh
sw3154A-ms98-a-0071 367.036000 373.065750 Neal's a person who says i like to pick it up but i don't believe in throwing it into the uh
sw3154A-ms98-a-0072 373.065750 380.110125 the landfill so i have my compost pile but most of us don't have the uh sufficient lot size to uh
sw3154A-ms98-a-0073 380.110125 381.347750 to do that
sw3154A-ms98-a-0074 381.347750 382.514375 [silence]
sw3154A-ms98-a-0075 382.514375 385.581875 uh so i'm glad the city's willing to take that on
sw3154A-ms98-a-0076 385.581875 388.793375 [silence]
sw3154A-ms98-a-0077 388.793375 395.845125 well there's someplace you know if it's because_1 really when i look at what my grass does in in actually about twenty four hours
sw3154A-ms98-a-0078 395.845125 407.760125 uh knowing what the farmers do in rural areas they just take their hay and just build a big mound of it and it naturally uh composts or stores and uh
sw3154A-ms98-a-0079 407.760125 422.531625 so all you have to do is just place it somewhere and churn it and it will naturally decompose uh so you just have to kind of keep in separated and then uh who knows how they process it from there and what they turn it into but it's
sw3154A-ms98-a-0080 422.531625 425.592875 it's certainly usable material
sw3154A-ms98-a-0081 425.592875 429.449625 [silence]
sw3154A-ms98-a-0082 429.449625 430.715750 uh-huh
sw3154A-ms98-a-0083 430.715750 432.935250 [silence]
sw3154A-ms98-a-0084 432.935250 434.522000 right
sw3154A-ms98-a-0085 434.522000 443.264375 but i the thing i don't understand about that is like when it's one thing to send grass there but i've trimmed trees and other things which uh
sw3154A-ms98-a-0086 443.264375 450.654000 end up being something that clearly won't decompose nearly as rapidly but it's still natural and i just don't know
