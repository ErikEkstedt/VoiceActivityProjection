sw3128A-ms98-a-0031 83.793875 94.394250 okay well i was thinking about if i did a dinner party right now i'd do a Mexi[can]- Mexican fare of sorts because_1 that's about the only thing i'm creative at and uh
sw3128A-ms98-a-0032 94.394250 106.951250 well for appetizers i'd start with the you know the typical cheese nachos and uh melt the cheese over the chips and uh put some green pepper or i mean chili peppers on top of that for those who like it hot 
sw3128A-ms98-a-0033 106.951250 119.642375 and then another good good um recipe for appetizers is uh bean dip i don't know if you've ever done that but you put just the uh refried beans and then a layer of uh
sw3128A-ms98-a-0034 119.642375 122.448750 of sour cream
sw3128A-ms98-a-0035 122.448750 134.061375 [noise] well it doesn't really have seven layers mine doesn't anyway and then i put like a layer of cheese and then some salsa on top of everything and then you just use it for dipping your chip into [noise] and
sw3128A-ms98-a-0036 134.061375 138.110250 yeah it's real good and then a
sw3128A-ms98-a-0037 138.110250 140.510375 probably go with fajitas
sw3128A-ms98-a-0038 140.510375 148.220250 uh season up some good chicken and beef and chop up a whole bunch of things so that they could kind of pick and choose what they like and
