sw3128B-ms98-a-0044 147.635625 150.427750 that's an easy way to please everybody
sw3128B-ms98-a-0045 150.427750 155.594750 that way if there's something that they don't want then they can just simply leave it off on their own
sw3128B-ms98-a-0046 155.594750 157.941625 that's a good idea
sw3128B-ms98-a-0047 157.941625 160.746750 [silence]
sw3128B-ms98-a-0048 160.746750 167.380250 well i'm a very casual informal person so most of my quote dinner parties
sw3128B-ms98-a-0049 167.380250 173.482250 would probably be very laid back we'd probably do ribs or chicken or
sw3128B-ms98-a-0050 173.482250 182.337000 something like that on the grill put with corn on the cob and maybe a tossed salad fresh fruit that type of a thing
sw3128B-ms98-a-0051 182.337000 192.608000 i'm a i'm a lover of paper plates in the summer time [laughter-and] disposable plastic forks throw them away for an easy cleanup
sw3128B-ms98-a-0052 192.608000 194.410125 so i
sw3128B-ms98-a-0053 194.410125 199.953375 i'm [laughter-afraid] i'm not a real fancy sit down kind of use your best china
sw3128B-ms98-a-0054 199.953375 202.025250 dinner party kind
sw3128B-ms98-a-0055 202.025250 203.933375 [laughter]
sw3128B-ms98-a-0056 203.933375 209.050375 [silence]
sw3128B-ms98-a-0057 209.050375 214.695250 well my life is kind of casual so my dinner parties would be also
sw3128B-ms98-a-0058 214.695250 218.501250 [silence]
sw3128B-ms98-a-0059 218.501250 222.991250 well what's a good potluck for eight to ten people what do you
sw3128B-ms98-a-0060 222.991250 230.689000 [silence]
sw3128B-ms98-a-0061 230.689000 232.422375 it can be anything
sw3128B-ms98-a-0062 232.422375 238.437875 it can be anything i [vocalized-noise] i may just bring fresh fruit because i know everybody will eat that even though it's not
sw3128B-ms98-a-0063 238.437875 240.787125 you know someone'll bring a meat
sw3128B-ms98-a-0064 240.787125 242.154375 if not
sw3128B-ms98-a-0065 242.154375 249.251750 we go meatless i don't care yeah we don't we don't we eat too [meach/much] too much meat at dinner parties anyhow [laughter]
sw3128B-ms98-a-0066 249.251750 260.387750 [silence]
sw3128B-ms98-a-0067 260.387750 263.421375 i think they always go over well
sw3128B-ms98-a-0068 263.421375 266.712125 [silence]
sw3128B-ms98-a-0069 266.712125 271.220000 i think we've probably discussed all they need to discuss
sw3128B-ms98-a-0070 271.220000 275.954000 [silence]
sw3128B-ms98-a-0071 275.954000 287.584750 okay i've enjoyed talking to you and i if i have a Mexican dinner at anytime i'll do i think i'll run your yours by and have fajitas and bean dip and the whole nine yards
