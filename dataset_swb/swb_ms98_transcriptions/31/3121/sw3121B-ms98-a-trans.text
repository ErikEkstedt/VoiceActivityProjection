sw3121B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.564875 [noise]
sw3121B-ms98-a-0002 0.564875 3.238500 [silence]
sw3121B-ms98-a-0003 3.238500 11.117750 well i think for me i i'm from Alabama south Alabama and so i grew up in the midst of civil rights movement
sw3121B-ms98-a-0004 11.117750 16.638875 uh in a pretty liberal family for for that area at the time
sw3121B-ms98-a-0005 16.638875 23.414750 and so i was very much a part of all the uh [noise] you know what was going on there uh
sw3121B-ms98-a-0006 23.414750 31.948125 my parents are pretty active and uh it was very scary and but now we've seen you know [noise] uh black people have a lot more civil rights
sw3121B-ms98-a-0007 31.948125 36.483750 in that area and i guess all over than they did you know twenty years ago
sw3121B-ms98-a-0008 36.483750 40.377375 there's still a lot to be [noise] you know to be accomplished but
sw3121B-ms98-a-0009 40.377375 52.465875 for me when i think about social change that's what i first think of because i can remember you know separate public restrooms and separate water fountains and sitting in the back of the bus and everything
sw3121B-ms98-a-0010 52.465875 57.080500 [silence]
sw3121B-ms98-a-0011 57.080500 58.519875 uh-huh
sw3121B-ms98-a-0012 58.519875 64.113375 [silence]
sw3121B-ms98-a-0013 64.113375 65.300625 uh-huh
sw3121B-ms98-a-0014 65.300625 76.623375 [silence]
sw3121B-ms98-a-0015 76.623375 78.010750 yeah
sw3121B-ms98-a-0016 78.010750 79.436500 well that's true
sw3121B-ms98-a-0017 79.436500 82.273125 that's a good one right there
sw3121B-ms98-a-0018 82.273125 98.262000 [silence]
sw3121B-ms98-a-0019 98.262000 104.969000 right and i grew up in out in the country too basically in a rural area and with lots of family
sw3121B-ms98-a-0020 104.969000 113.248125 and so we were always at family in different p[eople]- family members' homes but even now you know they don't even do that
sw3121B-ms98-a-0021 113.248125 115.449375 [silence]
sw3121B-ms98-a-0022 115.449375 121.307750 well and they're so busy people people's personal schedules are so busy
sw3121B-ms98-a-0023 121.307750 133.937375 mainly because i a lot of it has to do i think with more women working in our family you know twenty years ago not that many of the women worked and now uh almost all the women work
sw3121B-ms98-a-0024 133.937375 145.794500 and so that means you know a lot of [noise] a lot of the social visiting and all was i think probably instigated by women at that time right and now
sw3121B-ms98-a-0025 145.794500 156.097000 that's right and now uh i mean my mother does not work and and she you know she's f[inds]- finds herself pretty alone a lot because most of her friends are working women
sw3121B-ms98-a-0026 156.097000 165.219500 but even just social visits people don't do that anymore you're right and people don't feel comfortable just to drop in on people anymore
sw3121B-ms98-a-0027 165.219500 166.775625 there's a real
sw3121B-ms98-a-0028 166.775625 175.277625 right you know you don't want to you want to make sure it's okay or i guess we don't not to make invade people's privacy or whatever
sw3121B-ms98-a-0029 175.277625 183.971250 [silence]
sw3121B-ms98-a-0030 183.971250 191.737500 well out of out of fifteen grandchildren in my family only two of us don't live within fifty miles
sw3121B-ms98-a-0031 191.737500 201.095500 and th[at]- and most live within ten or or twenty so but that's you know that is rural it's a rural family and
sw3121B-ms98-a-0032 201.095500 210.459750 most people didn't go away i'm just one of the two out of fifteen that don't live in the you know even in the same state
sw3121B-ms98-a-0033 210.459750 212.784250 [silence]
sw3121B-ms98-a-0034 212.784250 215.534750 yeah there is in that area
sw3121B-ms98-a-0035 215.534750 225.833125 [silence]
sw3121B-ms98-a-0036 225.833125 238.026000 um-hum and i guess you know that would greatly affect social ch[ange]- i use social change probably the job market has alway[s]- and the the economy has always affected uh social change
sw3121B-ms98-a-0037 238.026000 239.497375 probably
sw3121B-ms98-a-0038 239.497375 249.113125 [silence]
sw3121B-ms98-a-0039 249.113125 252.503500 well i think just also you know
sw3121B-ms98-a-0040 252.503500 258.524375 the women's movement too has affected a lot of social change uh people marry 
sw3121B-ms98-a-0041 258.524375 261.014125 yeah people marry later
sw3121B-ms98-a-0042 261.014125 272.508500 i mean basically i think now again where i'm from in in Alabama that's not necessarily true because people do still get married right out of high school
sw3121B-ms98-a-0043 272.508500 277.592375 but now out here in Texas where i am now that's very unusual
sw3121B-ms98-a-0044 277.592375 287.116125 most people get marrie[d]- i mean get go to college or at least get a job and even you know people are seem to a lot of people seem to [noise]
sw3121B-ms98-a-0045 287.116125 293.688500 be engaged for a long time before they get married because they do want to be financially set up
sw3121B-ms98-a-0046 293.688500 308.822625 [silence]
sw3121B-ms98-a-0047 308.822625 320.458125 right but probably uh you know more women being in in the work force also greatly greatly affects social change because it affects child care and uh
sw3121B-ms98-a-0048 320.458125 321.669250 but
sw3121B-ms98-a-0049 321.669250 328.784375 [silence]
sw3121B-ms98-a-0050 328.784375 330.416125 right
sw3121B-ms98-a-0051 330.416125 337.993250 [silence]
sw3121B-ms98-a-0052 337.993250 348.819625 well and they're you know they're they're saying right now we don't know what we just now are seeing the effects of day care on the generation that's just now coming into the work force and in their twenties
sw3121B-ms98-a-0053 348.819625 357.774125 they are the first generation that basically grew up with day care and so you know it remained to be seen exactly what that what that does
sw3121B-ms98-a-0054 357.774125 362.905000 [silence]
