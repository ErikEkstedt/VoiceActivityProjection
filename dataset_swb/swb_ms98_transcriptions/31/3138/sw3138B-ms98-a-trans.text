sw3138B-ms98-a-0089 296.504375 301.982875 i bet the mayonnaise in there makes it really kind of gives it a tang that would be good
sw3138B-ms98-a-0090 301.982875 306.475500 i guess i would now use the the new mayonnaise free
sw3138B-ms98-a-0091 306.475500 310.708500 yeah that's really wonderful that they're coming out with so many
sw3138B-ms98-a-0092 310.708500 325.189250 new things like that because like i told my husband this summer i love to eat you know chicken salad and tuna salad and stuff like that and and you know basically it certainly a l[ow]- low calorie you know good thing except then you put your mayonnaise in there and spoil the whole thing
sw3138B-ms98-a-0093 325.189250 331.980750 you know and now it's it's it's okay and you can even i used to just put a tiny bit in well now i'm just putting more and more in
sw3138B-ms98-a-0094 331.980750 333.492000 [silence]
sw3138B-ms98-a-0095 333.492000 345.328750 yeah and it's only it used to be like a hun[dred]- hundred calories per tablespoon and now it's like twelve oh i just think that's the best thing to have happened i'm just so excited about that

sw3138B-ms98-a-0114 383.994375 387.747625 as our family would say a pig out huh [laughter]
sw3138B-ms98-a-0115 387.747625 395.131875 that's good oh one of my boys that that's twelve um [noise] is has high cholesterol
sw3138B-ms98-a-0116 395.131875 399.734125 have you ever found out about your kids
sw3138B-ms98-a-0117 399.734125 409.495625 and my other one does not so oh year or so ago he found out and he went on a fairly strict diet to try to get it down and did he was able to get it down
sw3138B-ms98-a-0118 409.495625 424.226375 it's i think it's mostly hereditary because we really have never eaten high things in cholesterol he's never eaten any eggs he's never had anything but skim milk and you know i've never bought butter [laughter] and things like that but um
sw3138B-ms98-a-0119 424.226375 438.494875 oh he just left for the doctor again and it's it's kind of back up um so he needs to be careful again so we've really been talking about the foods you know for him to to be sure to eat yeah and uh
sw3138B-ms98-a-0120 438.494875 443.505125 so he's eating an apple a day for the last two days [laughter]
sw3138B-ms98-a-0121 443.505125 449.529750 so all that kind of stuff does really help well i think we've probably talked long enough and
