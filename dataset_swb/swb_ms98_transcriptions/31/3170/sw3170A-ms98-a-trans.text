sw3170A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 11.544625 [noise] basically um my husband and myself use the credit cards in regards to major purchases we really don't get into small little purchases if we're going to purchase something quite large we might put it on a credit card but
sw3170A-ms98-a-0002 11.544625 16.046375 other than that it's not something that we use a lot of um
sw3170A-ms98-a-0003 16.046375 29.083125 we may have only two or three versus um i know a lot of people have up to a half a dozen or uh up to a dozen credit cards but um ours are just major credit cards that we have and uh use uh
sw3170A-ms98-a-0004 29.083125 33.873375 use only when when we feel it's necessary to make a big purchase
sw3170A-ms98-a-0005 33.873375 36.007000 [silence]
sw3170A-ms98-a-0006 36.007000 37.015250 yeah

sw3170A-ms98-a-0009 39.438875 41.501875 uh yeah one Sears
sw3170A-ms98-a-0010 41.501875 45.486500 Sears is pretty major with us simply because we do um
sw3170A-ms98-a-0011 45.486500 51.909625 appliances and things like that and they're real good with their appliance and stuff like that so
sw3170A-ms98-a-0012 51.909625 66.696000 but uh we try to avoid them with a passion because of the percent of interest rate if you've got the cash to pay for something it's better to do it that way than versus credit cards unless it's a small enough sum that you can do it within a two three month period but
sw3170A-ms98-a-0013 66.696000 67.866375 if it's uh
sw3170A-ms98-a-0014 67.866375 80.952000 any large purchases um you've got to kind of think about um how much you're going to put down as far as uh payments on it so that you're not getting eighteen percent or twenty percent interest taken off so
