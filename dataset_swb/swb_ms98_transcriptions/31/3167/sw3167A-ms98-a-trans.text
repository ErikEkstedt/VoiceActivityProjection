sw3167A-ms98-a-0032 111.775500 125.145375 so therefore you really don't have a very long life you know once you buy it i thought so you know they should put some directions on some of these new things they're making that you really don't know what the shelf life is you know

sw3167A-ms98-a-0050 187.805375 189.589875 [laughter]
sw3167A-ms98-a-0051 189.589875 198.536500 that's the that's the thing i hate most about entertaining is thinking of what i'm going to serve i- i said i can make it in no time it's trying to think
sw3167A-ms98-a-0052 198.536500 210.376125 and then we just uh built a new home and i have one of these kitchens that the center of the house and so no matter where they're at your company can see you cooking which is funny
sw3167A-ms98-a-0053 210.376125 221.755250 [laughter] well [laughter-this] is what everyone has said they said it's okay for you because_1 you keep a real neat kitchen [laughter-and] [laughter-i] [laughter-said] yes i decided it looks better in Better Homes and Gardens than it [laughter-does] in [laughter-practicality]
sw3167A-ms98-a-0054 221.755250 233.315250 but uh what i have learned in the uh ten months we've lived here is that when i entertain i have to have my foods all prepared and in the oven
sw3167A-ms98-a-0055 233.315250 247.040375 with all the [laughter-everything] through ready to serve because with the open area you don't want someone from your dining room seeing your mess like you said so you have to have the picturesque kitchen you know right out of the magazine
sw3167A-ms98-a-0056 247.040375 254.345625 [silence]
sw3167A-ms98-a-0057 254.345625 263.202125 you're [laughter-right] and you know the funny thing is now that i have a large kitchen with a big island and that i still have people trying to come in you know they'll come in the kitchen and i said
sw3167A-ms98-a-0058 263.202125 272.285750 out we have the chairs on the other [laughter-side] of the [laughter-counter] for [laughter-for] guests you're not allowed to trespass into my [laughter-kitchen] 
sw3167A-ms98-a-0059 272.285750 286.114625 and i[t]- it it has worked out but at our point of life we know many [noise] of the people we're entertaining [noise] uh well enough that they know you know it's very much at home type situation
sw3167A-ms98-a-0060 286.114625 293.616375 [silence]
sw3167A-ms98-a-0061 293.616375 299.714000 oh we even have a better one now we [laughter-decided] that we all meet we have it wor[ked]- worked
