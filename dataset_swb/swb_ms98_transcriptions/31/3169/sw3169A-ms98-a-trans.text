sw3169A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 7.922500 [noise] is uh kind of fun it's best done when you have leisure time and i had more of that in my childhood days than i have now [noise] and
sw3169A-ms98-a-0002 7.922500 18.362375 i grew up in an area that uh [noise] it was just a few feet from a rather large lake and a few more miles from that was a even larger lake and we had [noise]
sw3169A-ms98-a-0003 18.362375 28.900250 a variety of boats at our disposal um i worked for a camp for a number of years my father was on staff there and we had every kind of things from canoes to paddle boats sailboats 
sw3169A-ms98-a-0004 28.900250 38.689000 um speedboats uh you name it they had it and we did a lot of watering [noise] water sports but i think uh the thing i liked the best was uh we spent about a summer
sw3169A-ms98-a-0005 38.689000 47.176500 couple of guys uh restored an old wooden boat that was built back in the mid thirties and
sw3169A-ms98-a-0006 47.176500 58.043500 got a new canvas sail for it and had a real hu[ge]- big old four foot center board that went down in the middle to keep you upright when the waves or the wind came from the side and
sw3169A-ms98-a-0007 58.043500 66.275250 we got that thing in the water and had a real good time with it if you ever got it dumped over though it was a mess to get back up it wasn't like the newer ones that have nice
sw3169A-ms98-a-0008 66.275250 76.925875 chambers that keep it afloat or keep it uh upright again this one you had to work with [laughter-you] [laughter-get] [laughter-out] [laughter-of] the water again and get it upright and uh sailing was was kind of nice to
sw3169A-ms98-a-0009 76.925875 85.047500 learn the maneuvers you had to make to work your way down a lake or work back up against the the wind as it were attacking back and forth and
sw3169A-ms98-a-0010 85.047500 94.914625 um more than once we'd get out there on a really stormy day and uh the storm or the wind was due to the s[torm]- front blowing in and soon as the front came over
sw3169A-ms98-a-0011 94.914625 106.518500 it was calm so you're out in the middle of nowhere with a paddle [laughter-and] [laughter-you] paddle your way back in and hope it doesn't start raining on you right away [noise] and that didn't always work we often times got wet [noise] but um
sw3169A-ms98-a-0012 106.518500 117.013500 it's it's a nice nice hobby to have and nowadays i don't think i could afford the boat or the time nor do we live that close to a lake anymore so things change i guess
sw3169A-ms98-a-0013 117.013500 120.202250 what are your memories of boating or current
sw3169A-ms98-a-0014 120.202250 154.892250 [silence]
sw3169A-ms98-a-0015 154.892250 156.248250 right
sw3169A-ms98-a-0016 156.248250 157.502125 [silence]
sw3169A-ms98-a-0017 157.502125 158.745750 it's true
sw3169A-ms98-a-0018 158.745750 161.726375 [silence]
sw3169A-ms98-a-0019 161.726375 174.524125 yeah i remember learning how to ski oh i guess i was seven or eight years old and the lake that we learned on was the smaller of the two that we had access to and it was maybe fifteen twenty acres
sw3169A-ms98-a-0020 174.524125 177.797000 and it was uh [noise] it had a lot of um
sw3169A-ms98-a-0021 177.797000 189.454250 turtles in it and i got all ready to go and i was down in the water and and set to go and a and just as that boat took off a turtle bit me in the middle of the back it didn't hurt too much but it bit enough to where i let go
sw3169A-ms98-a-0022 189.454250 192.944875 and the boat went off without me and i reached back there and sn[atched]-
sw3169A-ms98-a-0023 192.944875 199.234500 pushed him away and got out of the water a a while and and uh it didn't even leave a mark it was just a little nibble and
sw3169A-ms98-a-0024 199.234500 209.354625 so i told everybody what happened and they go oh yeah sure you know and so i get back down in there and and i'll be if he didn't do it again this time a little earlier and and i had let go before then and
sw3169A-ms98-a-0025 209.354625 221.308500 before they took off this time and and swatted him away so i moved over a a few feet in the water and got out of his little realm where he was living underneath the dock and uh managed to get up didn't go very far but i got up
sw3169A-ms98-a-0026 221.308500 232.376500 and it it was a nice uh nice long skiing career but now i've gotten to where skiing is just kind of wears me out more than it does thrill me i've i've uh
sw3169A-ms98-a-0027 232.376500 238.160250 done about all i dare do on skis you know skiing on one and jumping around here and there and i
sw3169A-ms98-a-0028 238.160250 239.603875 i- i know how
sw3169A-ms98-a-0029 239.603875 250.129125 you can get injured doing much more than that and i just can't risk it right now being a head of the family and the breadwinner and all that just uh can't take the risk i did as a dumb teenager i guess
sw3169A-ms98-a-0030 250.129125 261.067375 so life changes a little bit in that respect [noise] i'd kind of like someday to maybe end up on a pair of skis that that doesn't have a uh well what they call trick skis they'll allow you to ski backwards i haven't
sw3169A-ms98-a-0031 261.067375 267.722375 cra[ft]- managed to get a hold on that uh craft yet but uh
sw3169A-ms98-a-0032 267.722375 278.036750 yeah it it'd be kind of nice i hadn't quite figured out i don't have anybody to teach me either that's another little thing you need somebody to kind of tell you what to do but just from what i've seen you just kind of w[ork]-
sw3169A-ms98-a-0033 278.036750 288.978750 work your way up to it and turn around real quick [laughter-you] [laughter-know] grab the rope behind you and then just l[et]- let go real quick and let it whip you around but uh i don't know maybe someday i'll
sw3169A-ms98-a-0034 288.978750 299.458000 [noise] i'll get back to that as after the kids are up and grown and the monies are there to get away for times on end uh weekend or something
