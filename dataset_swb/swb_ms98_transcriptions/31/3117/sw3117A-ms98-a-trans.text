sw3117A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.614625 [noise]
sw3117A-ms98-a-0002 0.614625 9.813250 okay well having uh personally uh helped [vocalized-noise] uh two children attend or or to select colleges one of them not very successfully [laughter]
sw3117A-ms98-a-0003 9.813250 14.187000 i'm not sure if i'm any authority on this topic at all [laughter]
sw3117A-ms98-a-0004 14.187000 19.080250 well our daughter uh went to the University of Virginia that was a good selection she
sw3117A-ms98-a-0005 19.080250 29.183000 yeah really is and she was she was very very happy there and v[ery]- and very successful in what she picked to do so uh she's just graduated from there so that was a good selection
sw3117A-ms98-a-0006 29.183000 32.805375 uh our son has this kind of you know he's
sw3117A-ms98-a-0007 32.805375 45.745875 well he started out going Stephen F Austin and that turned turned into you know flunking out because of of of uh too many parties going on then he stayed out of school for a while then he went to Richland for a couple of years and then he went to
sw3117A-ms98-a-0008 45.745875 51.804375 to DePaul in Chicago which would have been great but uh it was so expensive so now he's now he's back
sw3117A-ms98-a-0009 51.804375 54.351000 [silence]
sw3117A-ms98-a-0010 54.351000 63.589125 well in in that case [vocalized-noise] with him uh he kind of made the selections by himself and i think that we should have given him more direction and
sw3117A-ms98-a-0011 63.589125 72.826625 he was our first you know so we we didn't have quite the insight that uh that we would have had if he'd been our second like we did with Karen so uh
sw3117A-ms98-a-0012 72.826625 80.046125 but i i think you know i- just in terms of of what happened i think that first of all i'd i would know the reputation of the school
sw3117A-ms98-a-0013 80.046125 89.858750 and uh for more than just [vocalized-noise] academics but you know if it's a party school or not although i think every school [noise] is a party school to some degree personally [laughter] 
sw3117A-ms98-a-0014 89.858750 91.361750 [silence]
sw3117A-ms98-a-0015 91.361750 92.705250 right

sw3117A-ms98-a-0024 114.464500 116.474500 yeah

sw3117A-ms98-a-0026 118.358625 127.000875 [silence]
sw3117A-ms98-a-0027 127.000875 135.207875 yeah i've heard that from people who have gone to Texas yeah i went to uh Iowa State which is also a big eight school like Oklahoma
sw3117A-ms98-a-0028 135.207875 142.786000 yeah and uh when i was there it was maybe eleven or twelve thousand people which was just a great size i thought it's it's
sw3117A-ms98-a-0029 142.786000 146.536500 oh gosh [laughter] is awful
sw3117A-ms98-a-0030 146.536500 153.093750 [silence]
sw3117A-ms98-a-0031 153.093750 155.795000 uh-huh yeah
sw3117A-ms98-a-0032 155.795000 157.328375 yeah
sw3117A-ms98-a-0033 157.328375 159.593000 [silence]
sw3117A-ms98-a-0034 159.593000 164.559500 yes that that's true it makes a lot of difference and uh
sw3117A-ms98-a-0035 164.559500 169.248625 [silence]
sw3117A-ms98-a-0036 169.248625 170.564000 uh-huh
sw3117A-ms98-a-0037 170.564000 172.255125 [silence]
sw3117A-ms98-a-0038 172.255125 175.446000 you went to school there yeah right uh-huh
sw3117A-ms98-a-0039 175.446000 179.165250 [silence]
sw3117A-ms98-a-0040 179.165250 180.576500 uh-huh
sw3117A-ms98-a-0041 180.576500 183.930625 [silence]
sw3117A-ms98-a-0042 183.930625 193.561125 sure oh yeah yeah well our daughter chose uh Virginia because she didn't want to go to school in Texas i mean she just sort of didn't want to go to school here
sw3117A-ms98-a-0043 193.561125 194.788250 [silence]
sw3117A-ms98-a-0044 194.788250 196.443875 uh-huh
sw3117A-ms98-a-0045 196.443875 199.065500 yeah same deal
sw3117A-ms98-a-0046 199.065500 208.010000 yeah and uh in fact she was accepted at two schools in Texas uh Rice and Trinity but she decided she wanted to go out of state and uh
sw3117A-ms98-a-0047 208.010000 214.938875 Virginia was uh you know in the east it wasn't a you know it wasn't an Ivy League school but it was well it's fur[ther]- quite a bit further east and it was uh
sw3117A-ms98-a-0048 214.938875 225.256250 of the state schools that she could have gone to it was but one of the cheapest yet one of the best t[oo]- you know with the the academics and the tradition and everything that is there uh she made a really good selection we thought and
sw3117A-ms98-a-0049 225.256250 235.412625 so uh [vocalized-noise] uh she pretty much made that her[self]- herself but she did have some others in the wings you know there's another school that she she would've have have gone to if she hadn't been accepted there
sw3117A-ms98-a-0050 235.412625 244.337750 so uh [noise] i don't know i think i[t]- it really depends a lot on the child because our daughter is was just a lot more levelheaded about her proc[ess]- the process
sw3117A-ms98-a-0051 244.337750 255.989250 yeah [laughter] so uh but you know i guess you have to really look at your finances and uh Texas has such a bargain in education i mean
sw3117A-ms98-a-0052 255.989250 257.083000 yeah
sw3117A-ms98-a-0053 257.083000 260.354750 [silence]
sw3117A-ms98-a-0054 260.354750 262.789625 i know i know

sw3117A-ms98-a-0056 267.443875 269.385750 uh that's something
sw3117A-ms98-a-0057 269.385750 270.832000 uh
sw3117A-ms98-a-0058 270.832000 276.918625 [silence]
sw3117A-ms98-a-0059 276.918625 278.435500 oh wow
sw3117A-ms98-a-0060 278.435500 281.530250 [silence]
sw3117A-ms98-a-0061 281.530250 283.562875 my gosh
sw3117A-ms98-a-0062 283.562875 284.605375 [silence]
sw3117A-ms98-a-0063 284.605375 286.561500 that was a shocker
sw3117A-ms98-a-0064 286.561500 289.177125 no i'll bet not
sw3117A-ms98-a-0065 289.177125 291.669875 [silence]
sw3117A-ms98-a-0066 291.669875 294.805375 yeah yeah yeah i know how that is
sw3117A-ms98-a-0067 294.805375 307.444000 you you did pay yours good yeah my husband went to school on loans too and and we he was able you know we paid his off after we were married but uh well i'm at the university of Texas at Dallas and as a graduate student and uh
sw3117A-ms98-a-0068 307.444000 318.590625 you know i have to say that uh it's a real bargain i mean for as far as i'm concerned it's been a real bargain of course you know living at home makes a lot of difference if i had to to pay room and board somewhere that would make a lot of difference uh in
sw3117A-ms98-a-0069 318.590625 319.853125 [silence]
sw3117A-ms98-a-0070 319.853125 328.146000 uh [noise] i think uh on a yearly basis i'm trying to think i would just make it a rough figure of about
sw3117A-ms98-a-0071 328.146000 338.594000 uh with with the travel expenses and so on although she didn't come home that much [vocalized-noise] actually i would say between twelve and thirteen thousand a year
sw3117A-ms98-a-0072 338.594000 340.006000 [silence]
sw3117A-ms98-a-0073 340.006000 344.493375 it's not when you look at the you know the school and the fact that she was
sw3117A-ms98-a-0074 344.493375 347.139500 [silence]
sw3117A-ms98-a-0075 347.139500 358.041000 uh no on the lawn no no that's that's an honor that's bestowed on very few and she didn't get to do that although she knew people who did live there but yeah that's that would have been neat
sw3117A-ms98-a-0076 358.041000 361.880375 [silence]
sw3117A-ms98-a-0077 361.880375 371.506875 [laughter] well you know the graduation takes place right there on the lawn on on that in that big fat grassy area and uh
sw3117A-ms98-a-0078 371.506875 377.160000 they had four thousand graduates this spring and boy that was quite an event i'll tell you [laughter]
sw3117A-ms98-a-0079 377.160000 379.318750 oh yeah
sw3117A-ms98-a-0080 379.318750 380.984000 [silence]
sw3117A-ms98-a-0081 380.984000 382.590875 yeah
sw3117A-ms98-a-0082 382.590875 386.398750 that's a great place to visit that really is yeah
sw3117A-ms98-a-0083 386.398750 399.000750 yeah well they're just so it's just steeped in tradition and and the uh you know they're they still talk about Mister Jefferson [vocalized-noise] you know i mean the founder of the school of course was Mister Jeffer[son]- Thomas Jefferson and they and and a lot of
sw3117A-ms98-a-0084 399.000750 412.243875 right uh-huh and and a lot of the of his traditions i mean for instance they don't call the students freshmen sophomore junior senior they call them first year second year third year and fourth year because Mister Jefferson felt that one's education never ended
sw3117A-ms98-a-0085 412.243875 418.754500 and to you put those four designations of freshmen sophomore and so on on the person's education limited them
sw3117A-ms98-a-0086 418.754500 427.239250 and he felt that you could go on to school forever you should just have [vocalized-noise] the number of years that you were there attached to your name if you want to do identify someone so
sw3117A-ms98-a-0087 427.239250 436.282000 i had to be very careful about talking about seniors or fourth year students [laughter] you got to get the terminology right [laughter]
sw3117A-ms98-a-0088 436.282000 437.859875 yes
sw3117A-ms98-a-0089 437.859875 439.510625 all righty
sw3117A-ms98-a-0090 439.510625 440.610875 [silence]
sw3117A-ms98-a-0091 440.610875 444.246625 yes it certainly is i got to go make it here [laughter]
sw3117A-ms98-a-0092 444.246625 449.175375 well i i [vocalized-noise] this is my last one you're number ten of ten that i [vocalized-noise] i
