sw3117B-ms98-a-0003 12.197000 15.454750 well which colleges did they go to
sw3117B-ms98-a-0004 15.454750 17.973375 [silence]

sw3117B-ms98-a-0006 21.223625 49.711875 [silence]
sw3117B-ms98-a-0007 49.711875 55.717875 well i guess the question then becomes how did you all make the selection or did you just let them do them by themselves
sw3117B-ms98-a-0008 55.717875 87.575875 [silence]
sw3117B-ms98-a-0009 87.575875 101.448750 well that's true of course uh you know i- for me my son he's only six and but i had the experience with my sister going to school and she was i treated my sister almost like my daughter because she was nine ten years younger than i was and [vocalized-noise]
sw3117B-ms98-a-0010 101.448750 104.427375 she ended up going to the University of Oklahoma
sw3117B-ms98-a-0011 104.427375 113.414750 i can say that because it was a big well known school it had a well known education and it was a wonderful education but yet it was a small school
sw3117B-ms98-a-0012 113.414750 117.515000 whereas i went to the University of Texas which was you know a million people go there
sw3117B-ms98-a-0013 117.515000 128.274375 i think that for me it's going to be one of those things yes i want to make sure it has a good education but i also want to keep it small enough that you can enjoy it because Texas to me was almost too big
sw3117B-ms98-a-0014 128.274375 130.608750 it's way too big
sw3117B-ms98-a-0015 130.608750 133.473750 [silence]
sw3117B-ms98-a-0016 133.473750 136.130375 yes yes i'm i'm quite aware

sw3117B-ms98-a-0018 141.096000 144.408375 Texas only had fifty five thousand when i was there
sw3117B-ms98-a-0019 144.408375 154.508500 a[nd]- and for me i had to admit the one thing that i lacked was the uh interaction between uh students i knew everybody within my dorm but that was it
sw3117B-ms98-a-0020 154.508500 161.178625 because the school was just too big and whereas my sister when i went to visit her she knew everybody on the whole durn campus
sw3117B-ms98-a-0021 161.178625 162.669250 [silence]
sw3117B-ms98-a-0022 162.669250 172.581500 so uh course now we're we're already telling our son you know Tex[as]- uh Oklahoma's good and Arkansas is good now of course Texas is good only because you know
sw3117B-ms98-a-0023 172.581500 176.160625 i w[ent]- because i went there of course but uh
sw3117B-ms98-a-0024 176.160625 184.932000 we're going my parents let me choose on my own and i want to pretty much allow him to choose on his own but i kind of keep an ear open as to what he's doing
sw3117B-ms98-a-0025 184.932000 192.435625 [silence]

sw3117B-ms98-a-0030 254.915125 262.134500 right now they do now if the uh legislature has their way about it they gonna to uh raise t[uition]- tuition in in double 
sw3117B-ms98-a-0031 262.134500 270.429625 and see back when i went to school there when i first entered the school it cost me two hundred dollars as an out as an out of state student
sw3117B-ms98-a-0032 270.429625 282.623500 but then i was there for about two and a half years they then switched it to forty dollars per semester hour so almost overnight i went from two hundred dollars to eight hundred dollars
sw3117B-ms98-a-0033 282.623500 285.381250 and i have to admit uh [noise]
sw3117B-ms98-a-0034 285.381250 287.817250 i wasn't i wasn't quite ready for that one
sw3117B-ms98-a-0035 287.817250 293.370750 it took me only about twelve years after i graduated to finish paying off the bill but that's [vocalized-noise]
