sw3106B-ms98-a-0089 378.976875 389.019875 you know it has good informative things in there for things your gonna be buying [vocalized-noise] at one time or other and you can save them and it's got like tax tips in it and stuff like that
sw3106B-ms98-a-0090 389.019875 402.218750 maybe the the other one there's one out that's that has to do with with financial things like how to save money and and what bonds and {insurancers} and stuff like that to buy that we've got we had a
sw3106B-ms98-a-0091 402.218750 414.208000 sample subscription to that one and that one was was good too it had a the art[icle]- the one that that uh was a sample one had an art[icle]- article in there about college
sw3106B-ms98-a-0092 414.208000 427.480750 saving for your children and and what to do and what not to do and how much the uh uh projected cost was going to be by the time like you know mine reached college age and stuff
sw3106B-ms98-a-0093 427.480750 435.397625 and it's going to be pretty darn expensive and and it was saying you know what to you know how you could go about putting
sw3106B-ms98-a-0094 435.397625 449.900000 yeah yeah like those E-bonds there's something called an E-bond that you can buy and it and it you don't have to pay taxes on it and it's for the child and then when they turn it in when it mature[s]-
