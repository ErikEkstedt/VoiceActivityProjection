sw3106A-ms98-a-0031 107.040625 121.356750 to the National Enquirer [laughter] because it's good light reading some of it i wouldn't believe but i but it's interesting reading and believe it or not there are a few interesting articles in it too

sw3106A-ms98-a-0036 154.750375 167.674750 but i [noise] really don't read that many i never do buy them you know like when i'm at the grocery store magazines much i guess pretty much after that it's the newspaper and just books

sw3106A-ms98-a-0039 180.779250 193.299625 i just kind of stick to these two now but uh you know because they come to i do subscribe and they come once a week so you know they're and i don't really have time to read anymore

sw3106A-ms98-a-0043 210.917750 224.944625 something way out in the National Enquirer or something i just you know i just don't read it i just read the ones that sound interesting to me usually about movie stars or famous people
sw3106A-ms98-a-0044 224.944625 233.359875 i been reading all the stuff about [laughter-Ted] [laughter-Kennedy] [laughter] uh
