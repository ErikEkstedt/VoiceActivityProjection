sw3144B-ms98-a-0029 177.058750 183.075500 uh if you have a chance to rent it at least or it should be out on TV i would think
sw3144B-ms98-a-0030 183.075500 196.783000 um because_1 it's it's just a fun summer light comedy make your cheeks hurt laughing especially in the theater it was contagious you know i i imagine the way Soapdish was but with everyone laughing

sw3144B-ms98-a-0053 319.488500 322.999125 try and find time it's hard uh
sw3144B-ms98-a-0054 322.999125 327.733625 with Jim's schedule too just to get a time that we can both go and
sw3144B-ms98-a-0055 327.733625 340.997375 um i'm holding out for City Slickers for the two of us because uh we had friends that went to see that and said you know it's just perfect for our age group [laughter] and because i think he he needs a comedy too um
sw3144B-ms98-a-0056 340.997375 345.421625 uh and that's what he would have liked to have seen Regarding Henry too but knew that
sw3144B-ms98-a-0057 345.421625 352.495750 uh we've we've got a lot of company this summer which is wonderful we're really enjoying it but some of the different things we're doing uh
sw3144B-ms98-a-0058 352.495750 363.482625 there's just not a time enough time to do it all and he said well realistically [laughter] you know he knew he couldn't get them all in but uh Jay really liked Robin Hood um
sw3144B-ms98-a-0059 363.482625 368.694625 when the choir group went to see Backdraft and they thought that was uh
sw3144B-ms98-a-0060 368.694625 382.788125 it was funny cause he sounded like the critics he said you know the plot line and the characters uh you know aren't real big but the the fire scenes and the dra[fts]- you know that action part is fantastic
sw3144B-ms98-a-0061 382.788125 390.798875 but he thought Robin Hood was great it was real different then you'd expect but h[e]- but he enjoyed it and so
sw3144B-ms98-a-0062 390.798875 391.972875 [silence]
sw3144B-ms98-a-0063 391.972875 404.561750 yeah me too and yeah i really uh like him a lot which is why Dances With Wolves was the last movie we had seen for several months but it was i uh
sw3144B-ms98-a-0064 404.561750 416.229750 in fact uh a friend from Germany was visiting in March and we wanted we didn't ran out of time we wanted to take him to see it we were going to sit through it again because_1 we really wanted him to see it too
sw3144B-ms98-a-0065 416.229750 417.499125 uh
sw3144B-ms98-a-0066 417.499125 424.207750 i just thought that was terrific and i really enjoy Harrison Ford which is one of the reasons i wanted to see
sw3144B-ms98-a-0067 424.207750 431.302375 and he's very good in Regarding Henry that's not an easy part to play i i don't think
sw3144B-ms98-a-0068 431.302375 434.786000 [silence]
sw3144B-ms98-a-0069 434.786000 444.966250 yeah that's at that one won't hurt your sides [laughter] um it was this the first time you got to see One Hundred and One Dalmatians
