sw3197A-ms98-a-0004 6.134750 18.701750 yeah okay so anyway now we're talking about drug testing an all that and you ready okay [noise] so what do you think about it
sw3197A-ms98-a-0005 18.701750 29.559125 [silence]
sw3197A-ms98-a-0006 29.559125 39.975250 r[ight]- right i agree with you basically so might be a boring conversation [noise] but um but anyway i agree that
sw3197A-ms98-a-0007 39.975250 49.750500 um only when there's any question of safety does the employer have a right because otherwise i feel that
sw3197A-ms98-a-0008 49.750500 60.449375 the measure of whether someone is to stay employed or not it is just performance whether you're able to do the job up to par and
sw3197A-ms98-a-0009 60.449375 61.669625 [silence]
sw3197A-ms98-a-0010 61.669625 69.910875 that and if that can be done it shouldn't matter whatever the employee might do in his private life
sw3197A-ms98-a-0011 69.910875 72.965375 [silence]
sw3197A-ms98-a-0012 72.965375 74.788375 [laughter-okay]
sw3197A-ms98-a-0013 74.788375 86.246750 [silence]

sw3197A-ms98-a-0017 99.001875 102.662500 [vocalized-noise] well probably at least on the average

sw3197A-ms98-a-0024 139.505000 153.492875 right certainly and certainly in any case people who drink alcohol a lot are probably not as good workers i think that most drug testing programs don't include that
sw3197A-ms98-a-0025 153.492875 163.708625 they're really interested in looking for illegal drugs it seems to be more for the purpose of law enforcement than for
sw3197A-ms98-a-0026 163.708625 168.860750 the purpose of the employer's best interest for the job
sw3197A-ms98-a-0027 168.860750 173.658500 yeah um [laughter]
sw3197A-ms98-a-0028 173.658500 175.565000 [silence]
