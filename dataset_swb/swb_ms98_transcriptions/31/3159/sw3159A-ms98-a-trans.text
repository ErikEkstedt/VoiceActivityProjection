sw3159A-ms98-a-0003 3.311625 13.364750 [silence]
sw3159A-ms98-a-0004 13.364750 21.409750 oh i see i get uh McCalls of course anything that appeals to the homemaker since that's my main line of interest
sw3159A-ms98-a-0005 21.409750 35.505750 and then once in a while i'll pick up a Working Woman or something and realize why i don't want to re[enter]- go back to work [laughter] what i enjoy about staying home and uh i read magazines mainly because they're fast
sw3159A-ms98-a-0006 35.505750 41.502000 and if i wanna relax while i watch TV of course i'm one of those that does two things at once
sw3159A-ms98-a-0007 41.502000 50.153375 and uh i read Good Housekeeping and Better Homes and McCalls and i like them_1 because they're kind of short and to the subject

sw3159A-ms98-a-0011 67.827750 82.666875 i find that um about two years is probably my max on subscribing to one in particular and then i kind of get turned off by it other than Good Housekeeping Good Housekeeping is the one that kind of sets around for when um
sw3159A-ms98-a-0012 82.666875 94.029125 when i'm really have time and really wanna read something you know and i don't get into books too often because i have so many things that i stay occupied with uh on a general basis and
sw3159A-ms98-a-0013 94.029125 100.954000 we travel a lot so i enjoy reading parts on travel in the various uh you know different ones [noise]
sw3159A-ms98-a-0014 100.954000 109.076500 and i get into uh newspapers so th[at]- i guess that kind of tells you what kind of person i am i'm uh rea[d]- read it fast and put it [laughter-down] [laughter]
sw3159A-ms98-a-0015 109.076500 113.615375 [silence]
sw3159A-ms98-a-0016 113.615375 114.999250 right

sw3159A-ms98-a-0018 121.377500 122.898875 well
sw3159A-ms98-a-0019 122.898875 133.796125 that's what i do you clip recipes and you save them_1 forever and you never [laughter-really] [laughter-use] [laughter-them] and then s[o]- every so often you weed through them_1 and think where did i ever put that recipe
sw3159A-ms98-a-0020 133.796125 141.303750 but uh that's mainly my uh whole idea on you know short subject uh reading and things like this i
sw3159A-ms98-a-0021 141.303750 152.267625 i subscribe like i said to a few and once in a while i buy that new magazine called First on the newsstands or something like that but i kind of stay with my own subject matter of what
sw3159A-ms98-a-0022 152.267625 156.136375 uh pertains to my daily life at the present time
sw3159A-ms98-a-0023 156.136375 183.771750 [silence]
sw3159A-ms98-a-0024 183.771750 191.137250 right uh well sometimes if you know if you're in transportation in public transportation i know that people'll read them_1 on something like that
sw3159A-ms98-a-0025 191.137250 198.013375 but i think and the idea is to is and good i can just dump them_1 at the [laughter-other] [laughter-end] [laughter-and] [laughter-i] [laughter-don't] have to carry them_1 back with me
sw3159A-ms98-a-0026 198.013375 207.324500 i do that when we travel i always have my head with a magazine somewhere as we drive or wherever we no matter what it is air travel or anything and i
sw3159A-ms98-a-0027 207.324500 212.490750 [silence]

sw3159A-ms98-a-0031 232.313250 239.553250 uh reading the magazines hoping i would get more from it and it was just above my head without having someone there to
sw3159A-ms98-a-0032 239.553250 246.806750 give me the advice as i went along it was you know kind of a little bit more than what i needed so i never did get into them i
sw3159A-ms98-a-0033 246.806750 259.618500 when i bought the computer all of a sudden i was receiving them for some unknown reason through the mail i think they all said thought well we have a live one she'll [laughter-subscribe] but they were wrong i never got into them but uh okay
