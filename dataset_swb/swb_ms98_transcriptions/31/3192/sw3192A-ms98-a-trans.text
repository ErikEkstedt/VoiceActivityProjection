sw3192A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 2.908500 [noise] go ahead what do you have to say on the subject
sw3192A-ms98-a-0002 2.908500 38.983250 [silence]
sw3192A-ms98-a-0003 38.983250 45.132250 and then they're gonna tax you on that for or they're gonna give you an interest on it i know somebody that it happened to [noise]
sw3192A-ms98-a-0004 45.132250 48.373500 no see believe it or not i'm one of these honest guys
sw3192A-ms98-a-0005 48.373500 62.842625 but i get to the point that last year we took a transfer and so therefore we had the boost in the income due to the transfer expenses when i sat down when we were through and i sat down with our accountant and we did it
sw3192A-ms98-a-0006 62.842625 67.360500 if i'm not presently working outside of the home if i return to work
sw3192A-ms98-a-0007 67.360500 74.826125 believe it or not with our state income tax our city income tax city we live in and city we work [laughter-in]
sw3192A-ms98-a-0008 74.826125 82.409125 i would have lost and with social security i would have lost forty eight cents on every dollar that i earned
sw3192A-ms98-a-0009 82.409125 91.802500 and well easily just [laughter-as] [laughter-you] [laughter-said] and i sat down and thought about it and i should be in a pretty good position because_1 i don't have little kids any more that i need
sw3192A-ms98-a-0010 91.802500 100.363625 sitters for or anything like that if i go to work it would be for our fun money and we realized that how it would [distrupt/disrupt] disrupt our
sw3192A-ms98-a-0011 100.363625 108.050625 travel routine and things like that and my husband gets five weeks vacation and we said it's not worth it i'm not working any more
sw3192A-ms98-a-0012 108.050625 116.992500 it just isn't worth it and you get frustrated and yet i don't know what the Te[xas]- uh the Texas rules are
sw3192A-ms98-a-0013 116.992500 123.495750 [silence]
sw3192A-ms98-a-0014 123.495750 126.500750 do you pay a state income income tax
sw3192A-ms98-a-0015 126.500750 128.066625 [silence]
sw3192A-ms98-a-0016 128.066625 129.544875 you don't
sw3192A-ms98-a-0017 129.544875 130.981875 [silence]
sw3192A-ms98-a-0018 130.981875 136.090500 um they start with one percent and then [laughter-they] [laughter-get] [laughter-you] [laughter-every] [laughter-two] [laughter-year]
sw3192A-ms98-a-0019 136.090500 140.019250 [noise] uh sales tax we pay seven percent
sw3192A-ms98-a-0020 140.019250 142.328000 [silence]
sw3192A-ms98-a-0021 142.328000 150.886250 you're so you're higher but you get {out-of-towners} on that then you get everyone on your state uh sales tax which is good
sw3192A-ms98-a-0022 150.886250 159.839250 as uh the income tax what's not fair is paying in the city you live in right now we're living where there is a reciprocity 
sw3192A-ms98-a-0023 159.839250 164.671375 so if you do pay more in the city you're working you don't owe your city anything
sw3192A-ms98-a-0024 164.671375 173.827750 and this year well my husband's actually keeping track of all his time out of the city of Cleveland so that we can get the difference because_1 our city is a little bit less
sw3192A-ms98-a-0025 173.827750 183.481000 [silence]
sw3192A-ms98-a-0026 183.481000 184.646375 right
sw3192A-ms98-a-0027 184.646375 190.619500 [silence]
sw3192A-ms98-a-0028 190.619500 194.308750 oh abso[lutely]- and much less they don't pay you an interest
sw3192A-ms98-a-0029 194.308750 227.468000 [silence]
sw3192A-ms98-a-0030 227.468000 228.769625 right
sw3192A-ms98-a-0031 228.769625 232.922750 [silence]
sw3192A-ms98-a-0032 232.922750 238.077000 well and it is now to the point that it has gotten so um
sw3192A-ms98-a-0033 238.077000 245.970375 so complicated i can do ours in a normal year i have always done our income tax and i've done it with transfers and sale of property
sw3192A-ms98-a-0034 245.970375 253.886250 but this last time it was so involved that i just threw it all up and said forget it let's go see a CPA well
sw3192A-ms98-a-0035 253.886250 256.349125 [silence]
sw3192A-ms98-a-0036 256.349125 269.973750 that's what i understand uh this one seemed to do well and uh she did go over our last three or four years and she said i have to compliment [laughter-you] you have excelled she said i cannot find one 
sw3192A-ms98-a-0037 269.973750 274.745125 thing to pull out that you haven't already pulled and i said well i do keep records
sw3192A-ms98-a-0038 274.745125 278.448625 all year long as i go one on twice a month one on
sw3192A-ms98-a-0039 278.448625 288.494250 [laughter] well that's what she said i went in there and i had all my books and i said now what do you want to know and i keep every single thing as i write the checks twice a month i enter it
sw3192A-ms98-a-0040 288.494250 298.850000 uh in either donations wherever it goes i do keep good records and so therefore this time i did not like having to go to someone else because_1 i said well i've got all every[thing]-
