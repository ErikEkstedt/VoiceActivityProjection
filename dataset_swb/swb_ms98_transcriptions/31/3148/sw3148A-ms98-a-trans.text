sw3148A-ms98-a-0004 4.743875 6.085625 in Plano
sw3148A-ms98-a-0005 6.085625 7.607875 in Dallas
sw3148A-ms98-a-0006 7.607875 9.188125 [silence]
sw3148A-ms98-a-0007 9.188125 14.664375 uh the air pollution isn't too bad in our area so we're very fortunate but
sw3148A-ms98-a-0008 14.664375 18.354000 i know in some areas it's really it it really is bad
sw3148A-ms98-a-0009 18.354000 34.366250 [silence]
sw3148A-ms98-a-0010 34.366250 36.104875 i haven't either
sw3148A-ms98-a-0011 36.104875 38.227375 [silence]
sw3148A-ms98-a-0012 38.227375 39.188750 uh-huh
sw3148A-ms98-a-0013 39.188750 41.446375 [silence]
sw3148A-ms98-a-0014 41.446375 52.683625 well i think it would be terrible to live in an area like that and unfortunately i think there are a lot of areas that are that that bad particularly in the areas where there are industries uh
sw3148A-ms98-a-0015 52.683625 65.763500 where they are burning a lot of coal [noise] and oil up more up north i guess uh i think it's a bigger problem with the car pollution antipollution devices i think the
sw3148A-ms98-a-0016 65.763500 71.554000 air isn't as bad as it once was from the cars because we certainly have plenty of cars in our area
sw3148A-ms98-a-0017 71.554000 114.700875 [silence]
sw3148A-ms98-a-0018 114.700875 116.454125 from acid rain
sw3148A-ms98-a-0019 116.454125 122.170750 [silence]
sw3148A-ms98-a-0020 122.170750 131.880375 i think it gives off uh in the emissions it gives off gases which combine up in the atmosphere uh and form a a weak acid
sw3148A-ms98-a-0021 131.880375 142.489125 it just makes the rain fall on the acid side and after a period of time i think that accumulates in uh trees because they take it up through their roots
sw3148A-ms98-a-0022 142.489125 149.576125 as well as it landing on the leaves on surfaces like you've seen what it's done to buildings even where it's really bad
sw3148A-ms98-a-0023 149.576125 152.980750 what's interesting several years ago i took a course
sw3148A-ms98-a-0024 152.980750 161.261000 uh on uh well it was actually it was put on by the power companies and about the various sources of energy and
sw3148A-ms98-a-0025 161.261000 167.492875 how much pollution there was and there wasn't from various kinds of of energy and uh
sw3148A-ms98-a-0026 167.492875 178.618375 at that point in time one person that was a speaker brought up the topic of acid rain and it was kind of pooh-poohed you know oh you're making a mountain out of a molehill kind of thing
sw3148A-ms98-a-0027 178.618375 190.104125 and it's turned out that that's been very true what he was forecasting about the accumulation of of the pollutants in the air and the acid rain and what it would do to foliage
sw3148A-ms98-a-0028 190.104125 193.289625 so it's kind of interesting the change in
sw3148A-ms98-a-0029 193.289625 195.139750 perspective
sw3148A-ms98-a-0030 195.139750 206.527125 from when i took that course now a lot of people are really afraid of nuclear uh i'm not afraid of nuclear having had that course because of how the nuclear that uh they use
sw3148A-ms98-a-0031 206.527125 221.051750 is not bomb quality and we're so strict with all our controls in the United States the chances of of an accident are slight and it doesn't pollute the air at all it's safer to be around a nuclear plant then it is to be around a coal plant
sw3148A-ms98-a-0032 221.051750 230.998000 many more deaths have occurred in and dealing with coal plants then ever around nuclear plants it's kind of funny because people are just petrified at least some are at the thought of nuclear
sw3148A-ms98-a-0033 230.998000 232.157500 [silence]
sw3148A-ms98-a-0034 232.157500 244.717875 so i don't know in Europe there's a lot of dependency on nuclear power and they recycle the fuel and then instead of of some people are really afraid to recycle the fuel because they're afraid it could become uh bomb quality
sw3148A-ms98-a-0035 244.717875 245.811375 [silence]
sw3148A-ms98-a-0036 245.811375 259.037625 but that's the only sensible thing to do is recycle and reuse the fuel and not store it down in the ground as far as i'm concerned where it could eventually perhaps there's some problem uh pollute the groundwater
sw3148A-ms98-a-0037 259.037625 269.562500 so i don't know what the answer is the best answer of course would be solar or uh [noise] fusion or something clean [laughter] well we've got a problem on the line don't we
sw3148A-ms98-a-0038 269.562500 273.272625 [silence]
sw3148A-ms98-a-0039 273.272625 274.604125 uh-huh
sw3148A-ms98-a-0040 274.604125 276.678875 but uh
sw3148A-ms98-a-0041 276.678875 280.137250 solar of course would be the clean cleanest 
sw3148A-ms98-a-0042 280.137250 290.860625 [silence]
sw3148A-ms98-a-0043 290.860625 293.186625 i can't hear you at all for all this static
sw3148A-ms98-a-0044 293.186625 298.936375 [silence]
sw3148A-ms98-a-0045 298.936375 300.840125 now i can again
sw3148A-ms98-a-0046 300.840125 309.227750 [silence]
sw3148A-ms98-a-0047 309.227750 310.359250 uh-huh
sw3148A-ms98-a-0048 310.359250 325.957500 [silence]
sw3148A-ms98-a-0049 325.957500 327.290375 uh-huh
sw3148A-ms98-a-0050 327.290375 332.963125 [silence]
sw3148A-ms98-a-0051 332.963125 335.775875 oh yeah it it's still got a long way to go
sw3148A-ms98-a-0052 335.775875 345.696500 it's just you know a possible solution in the future i think maybe to help in some ways it may not in all ways maybe they'll come up with fusion
sw3148A-ms98-a-0053 345.696500 349.154000 you know con[trol]- be able to control it i don't know how long that'll take but
sw3148A-ms98-a-0054 349.154000 350.834625 [laughter]
sw3148A-ms98-a-0055 350.834625 353.438250 one of these days because that's perfectly clean
sw3148A-ms98-a-0056 353.438250 364.356250 it's just we can't control it right now it takes more energy to cause fusion to occur then you get out so it isn't not at all and you can't control it unless you gotten a huge electromagnetic field so that's not going to work
sw3148A-ms98-a-0057 364.356250 365.391625 [silence]
sw3148A-ms98-a-0058 365.391625 367.739750 at least not now but uh
sw3148A-ms98-a-0059 367.739750 370.579750 who knows what the future will hold
sw3148A-ms98-a-0060 370.579750 371.668750 [silence]
sw3148A-ms98-a-0061 371.668750 374.532000 uh as far as energy goes i i think
sw3148A-ms98-a-0062 374.532000 376.056500 [silence]
sw3148A-ms98-a-0063 376.056500 383.546500 with solving some of the energy future energy problems we'll probably solve some of the pollution problems as well
sw3148A-ms98-a-0064 383.546500 384.826750 [silence]
sw3148A-ms98-a-0065 384.826750 386.307625 i do to [noise]
sw3148A-ms98-a-0066 386.307625 389.981500 i like to be optimistic i don't like to be [laughter-pessimistic] about these things
sw3148A-ms98-a-0067 389.981500 401.496875 [silence]
sw3148A-ms98-a-0068 401.496875 404.814500 we have one earth to live on and we got to take care of it
sw3148A-ms98-a-0069 404.814500 405.960000 uh-huh
sw3148A-ms98-a-0070 405.960000 408.834125 [silence]
sw3148A-ms98-a-0071 408.834125 419.303750 i've noticed students are are much more you know young young people are much more receptive to ideas about the environment and protecting the earth
sw3148A-ms98-a-0072 419.303750 425.803375 and so if we can raise it uh you know generations with those concerns we'll solve a lot of our problems
sw3148A-ms98-a-0073 425.803375 427.087625 i'm afraid
sw3148A-ms98-a-0074 427.087625 434.804375 i know i was part of the me generation where they didn't so many of them didn't people didn't care you know it's whatever
sw3148A-ms98-a-0075 434.804375 443.166500 you know recycle well if it's a problem forget that uh not throw the trash out the car window and leave it in the car and then throw it away
sw3148A-ms98-a-0076 443.166500 450.626375 how horrible [laughter] you know now i've always done those kinds of things because i just didn't like messes uh and cre[ate]-
