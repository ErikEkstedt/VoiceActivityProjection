sw3148B-ms98-a-0020 70.378500 79.239625 yes well i know uh that's been the concern in Europe they hadn't uh we have friends in Germany and uh
sw3148B-ms98-a-0021 79.239625 88.316625 have family that live near the Black Forest area and large areas of the forest are being hurt from the cars because when we [vocalized-noise]
sw3148B-ms98-a-0022 88.316625 97.219375 s[witched]- uh switched to the unleaded gas and and had the emission control advice uh devices required on the cars
sw3148B-ms98-a-0023 97.219375 105.755125 uh that's something that Europe didn't do right away and now they're doing that and i guess it started in the last few years because they have found
sw3148B-ms98-a-0024 105.755125 116.146125 that in that particular part of the country that's the only pollution that's been there it's not an area that is industry but they were losing a lot of uh trees and a lot of
sw3148B-ms98-a-0025 116.146125 119.777125 um i guess from from something that the car was
sw3148B-ms98-a-0026 119.777125 121.468625 um
sw3148B-ms98-a-0027 121.468625 122.741875 was giving

sw3148B-ms98-a-0039 280.506625 291.496875 well and i would think in our um we did have a solar water heater when we lived in Houston and uh oddly enough i thought our part of the country was ideal
sw3148B-ms98-a-0040 291.496875 299.878500 oh [noise] i don't know what to [noise] usually it's the other phone i have trouble with it must just be on the line can you hear me

sw3148B-ms98-a-0042 301.574375 304.099375 i don't know what uh
sw3148B-ms98-a-0043 304.099375 318.787000 i i don't know what the problem is but uh when we lived in Houston we had a solar water heater and we had thought this part of the country would be ideal for solar homes and solar energy and we have enough clouds that uh 
sw3148B-ms98-a-0044 318.787000 332.377375 there are other areas that would be better suited that surprised me because i think we have a tremendous amount of um sunny days and and it yes it can be used and it can help but uh that was a problem that they were still
sw3148B-ms98-a-0045 332.377375 333.816375 working on but

sw3148B-ms98-a-0056 389.575000 401.358875 well i do think um i mean you've already mentioned several things i think uh just the change in attitude and the fact that more people are aware there's a problem and more people are interested in uh
