sw3156B-ms98-a-0006 61.348000 65.590625 and a lot of hassle all year round and cans laying yeah
sw3156B-ms98-a-0007 65.590625 96.187250 [silence]
sw3156B-ms98-a-0008 96.187250 109.005375 [noise] no i read in the paper this week where maybe i don't know if it w[as]- was i guess maybe this week someone may start getting them if the truck that picks them_1 up is outfitted in time
sw3156B-ms98-a-0009 109.005375 115.525625 [noise] but i it it should be starting i would stay probably in the next month if if everything goes that
sw3156B-ms98-a-0010 115.525625 124.163750 uh i'm not sure all what we're gonna have to do whether we have three separate containers i really don't understand that part on what they've told you to separate everything
sw3156B-ms98-a-0011 124.163750 131.836000 [silence]

sw3156B-ms98-a-0017 174.755750 181.002375 [silence]
sw3156B-ms98-a-0018 181.002375 182.766000 well it'd get messy too
sw3156B-ms98-a-0019 182.766000 188.561500 i- i- i know other places when they recycle they have to like wash out their glass jars and whatnot
sw3156B-ms98-a-0020 188.561500 194.810375 and uh which we're not in the habit of doing i was brought up uh you know long time ago that
sw3156B-ms98-a-0021 194.810375 206.620125 they didn't even have cans they had bottles and you'd return them to the the grocery store and you'd get your money back and that that was all well and good and they don't seem to still be doing that if they could just eliminate the cans and use glass but 
sw3156B-ms98-a-0022 206.620125 210.175875 i guess this day and age they don't
sw3156B-ms98-a-0023 210.175875 211.421750 [noise]
sw3156B-ms98-a-0024 211.421750 221.161375 [silence]

sw3156B-ms98-a-0026 222.685625 230.375125 [silence]
sw3156B-ms98-a-0027 230.375125 234.393500 um-hum yeah and they uh p[eople]- i- i think kids don't
sw3156B-ms98-a-0028 234.393500 241.953250 [noise] appreciate maybe the value of money that it's so little that they don't care they can get more somewhere else uh for a good many
sw3156B-ms98-a-0029 241.953250 251.429625 right they're the the nickels the dimes or what [laughter-i] [laughter-suppose] [laughter-it] [laughter-might] be quarter and fifty cent pieces in these days that they would get they the kids just don't seem to
sw3156B-ms98-a-0030 251.429625 255.252375 to care that that much about a small amount of money
sw3156B-ms98-a-0031 255.252375 257.545625 [silence]
sw3156B-ms98-a-0032 257.545625 270.840500 but now we we did buy a can crusher and we are crushing cans and when we buy the soda when it's on sale for ninety nine cents so i would say in the last three years we've probably used a lot more cans than ever before um it was just easier
sw3156B-ms98-a-0033 270.840500 276.279375 to do that than to open a large [noise] liter bottle and then have it go flat
sw3156B-ms98-a-0034 276.279375 283.219125 [noise] so that's the main reason we're we uh sort of are into cans [laughter-at] [laughter-this] point rather than the liter [laughter-bottles] 
sw3156B-ms98-a-0035 283.219125 295.957250 [noise] well as you say it takes a while to build it up since we've had the crusher all summer we [noise] i guess we just now maybe have a bag full that we haven't ta[ken]- oh i think the kids when we were on vacation they said they did take them_1 to a
sw3156B-ms98-a-0036 295.957250 298.164250 a recycling place probably at one of the
sw3156B-ms98-a-0037 298.164250 298.562000 li[braries]-
