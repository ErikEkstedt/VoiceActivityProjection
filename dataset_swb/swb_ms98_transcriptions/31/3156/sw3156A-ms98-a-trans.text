sw3156A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 8.198375 [noise] [vocalized-noise] it seems to be a a topic that's gonna probably take about a generation to uh catch on it seems or maybe a generation to two
sw3156A-ms98-a-0002 8.198375 16.948125 and we may have to do it out of necessity as far as moving that time schedule up but it does seem to be a lot of habits to break
sw3156A-ms98-a-0003 16.948125 23.567125 i um wasn't raised as a kid on it but my kids are and so they they tended to wanna
sw3156A-ms98-a-0004 23.567125 27.772125 grab the aluminum cans when that was one of the first things to do and
sw3156A-ms98-a-0005 27.772125 33.981500 we were doing all right there until uh the price dropped out [noise] and they weren't worth anything anymore
sw3156A-ms98-a-0006 33.981500 37.275500 and we it took us um
sw3156A-ms98-a-0007 37.275500 47.509375 [noise] almost a year to get a garbage sack full we just don't drink that many so as far as at home use uh we'll pick up a six pack every once in a while or for whatever occasion
sw3156A-ms98-a-0008 47.509375 53.342750 of Dr Pepper or something and and by the time we gathered up enough crushed cans to take it in
sw3156A-ms98-a-0009 53.342750 60.565250 uh at the time it was still oh about forty or fifty cents a pound and we came out with about_1 a dollar
sw3156A-ms98-a-0010 60.565250 72.854125 [laughter-it] just really wasn't worth it [laughter] yeah so they they realized you know well of course to them a dollar was a dollar at four and five years old that wasn't uh that was a big deal but
sw3156A-ms98-a-0011 72.854125 76.064250 we decided it wasn't worth us keeping it and then um
sw3156A-ms98-a-0012 76.064250 84.121750 TI started keeping up with uh cans there so occasionally i'll bring whatever i've got laying around the car or the like and throw them_1 in there
sw3156A-ms98-a-0013 84.121750 88.785000 least it gets back into the system but um as far as a habit at the house uh 
sw3156A-ms98-a-0014 88.785000 93.880750 i haven't started on anything other than just whatever the city wants to pick up
sw3156A-ms98-a-0015 93.880750 96.848875 have y'all got the individual containers yet
sw3156A-ms98-a-0016 96.848875 108.657375 [silence]
sw3156A-ms98-a-0017 108.657375 109.857875 hm
sw3156A-ms98-a-0018 109.857875 123.105125 [silence]
sw3156A-ms98-a-0019 123.105125 135.985375 right yeah it seemed like uh if if i recall it's been a long time they're way behind schedule on that particular part of it they were fine on the green big green containers but uh seems like they said they were just gonna have a bin
sw3156A-ms98-a-0020 135.985375 148.857875 and all s[orts]- different types would go in there and then that they would sort it as as needed it it seemed that there was at the time anyway the thinking was that there was too much not getting sorted properly
sw3156A-ms98-a-0021 148.857875 156.839750 and that at at the collection sites where everything's clearly labeled and people that happen to go to that kind of trouble to do it happen to do it pretty well
sw3156A-ms98-a-0022 156.839750 164.913000 uh those are okay to have the general public doing the sorting but when it comes down to just general purpose trash that all the houses
sw3156A-ms98-a-0023 164.913000 168.890875 um the success rate of getting it sorted properly seemed to be poor so
sw3156A-ms98-a-0024 168.890875 173.428500 they felt that having one guy just sit there and run through it real quick was better than
sw3156A-ms98-a-0025 173.428500 181.246625 than having a household try it but i- i don't know that sounds like an awful lot of labor to sort the entire week's worth of trash for a house
sw3156A-ms98-a-0026 181.246625 182.488000 [silence]
sw3156A-ms98-a-0027 182.488000 184.285125 yeah yeah

sw3156A-ms98-a-0030 189.001875 190.639375 [silence]
sw3156A-ms98-a-0031 190.639375 192.120875 that's true
sw3156A-ms98-a-0032 192.120875 197.313875 [silence]
sw3156A-ms98-a-0033 197.313875 198.938500 right

sw3156A-ms98-a-0035 208.604875 210.209375 yeah [noise]
sw3156A-ms98-a-0036 210.209375 222.462000 they don't do that we live next to a set of railroad tracks and it seemed to be a very popular thing for people driving by that highway there by our tracks to throw the bottles at the tracks and try to crash you know break them_1 but
sw3156A-ms98-a-0037 222.462000 232.285125 uh they weren't that successful so there were a lot of bottles to be returned and we just walk about a half a mile in each direction and gathered up enough to buy whatever we wanted for the day [laughter-and]
sw3156A-ms98-a-0038 232.285125 239.953250 [silence]
sw3156A-ms98-a-0039 239.953250 242.773875 yeah just a little bit of begging will [laughter]
sw3156A-ms98-a-0040 242.773875 255.434000 [silence]
sw3156A-ms98-a-0041 255.434000 256.979000 right
sw3156A-ms98-a-0042 256.979000 259.183125 well i wonder if
sw3156A-ms98-a-0043 259.183125 263.776000 [silence]
sw3156A-ms98-a-0044 263.776000 265.030500 yeah
sw3156A-ms98-a-0045 265.030500 275.183250 [silence]
