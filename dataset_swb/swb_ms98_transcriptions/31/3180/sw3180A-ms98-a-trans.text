sw3180A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.355500 [noise]
sw3180A-ms98-a-0002 0.355500 11.967500 something that i guess some people abuse a lot they tend to get let it sneak up on them and get a little bit of money out there on them we didn't uh get too much built up on it that we didn't know it was out there but
sw3180A-ms98-a-0003 11.967500 20.625125 we used them through a period of time that we needed to and then uh consolidated all of it and brought it into a single controllable
sw3180A-ms98-a-0004 20.625125 29.826375 uh line of credit at our credit union and uh used that as a when the interest rate dropped below what the cards were as a way of paying it off
sw3180A-ms98-a-0005 29.826375 31.473250 uh
sw3180A-ms98-a-0006 31.473250 36.828500 [silence]
sw3180A-ms98-a-0007 36.828500 37.942750 right
sw3180A-ms98-a-0008 37.942750 50.427250 yeah it's it's strange that that i guess to draw new customers i've seen a few banks in this area have uh oh i guess it was like thirteen point nine or so or some of them were even twelve nine
sw3180A-ms98-a-0009 50.427250 60.406750 i can't imagine how they made that up made that difference up unless they had a quite a fee on it or some sort of restrictions or every transactions fees or something because
sw3180A-ms98-a-0010 60.406750 64.550125 that was back when you know eighteen and nineteen and twenty one was prevalent 
sw3180A-ms98-a-0011 64.550125 76.068375 [silence]
sw3180A-ms98-a-0012 76.068375 77.202500 right
sw3180A-ms98-a-0013 77.202500 83.060875 [silence]
sw3180A-ms98-a-0014 83.060875 93.308250 the last card i got in the last week i got an application for one that was similar to the Discover only it was a gold Visa that offered one percent of y[our]- all your purchases back
sw3180A-ms98-a-0015 93.308250 105.769375 but they had a uh a user's fee of like oh it was thirty five or forty five dollars a year and there was one of the other things they said was so good about the card was that there was no transaction fee
sw3180A-ms98-a-0016 105.769375 107.788125 if you use it at a uh
sw3180A-ms98-a-0017 107.788125 119.648750 a different teller than the ones that are at the bank that issues it which of course is an out of state one so [laughter-that] would have been kind of all of mine would have been but the credit union uh
sw3180A-ms98-a-0018 119.648750 130.052375 that we're with does charge you if you happen to use outside their's but that's there's so many of theirs that it doesn't matter i- i hardly i never have that i know of
sw3180A-ms98-a-0019 130.052375 139.961125 [silence]
sw3180A-ms98-a-0020 139.961125 141.059625 um-hum
sw3180A-ms98-a-0021 141.059625 155.883625 [silence]
sw3180A-ms98-a-0022 155.883625 156.971750 yep
sw3180A-ms98-a-0023 156.971750 158.380000 [silence]
sw3180A-ms98-a-0024 158.380000 164.642375 and if you happen [vocalized-noise] to check your balance at the same time it would be two more dollars at least that's that's something huh
sw3180A-ms98-a-0025 164.642375 176.966625 the uh the way the Metroplex is laid out i drive by nine other sites before i get to the one i work at and so there's there's several opportunities to use the uh
sw3180A-ms98-a-0026 176.966625 191.554500 card there and i happen to be less than a mile from one site and it's real convenient just to run up and get cash fact it's the closest automatic teller there is and it just happened to be the one that uh i'm with so that's nice to have those around
sw3180A-ms98-a-0027 191.554500 202.078625 and i only drive ten miles to work so it's kind of a uh one of those situations where they're they're all around me as it were i just happen to be in the right straight line between them_1
sw3180A-ms98-a-0028 202.078625 206.226500 [silence]
sw3180A-ms98-a-0029 206.226500 212.560000 i have done that once and i did it uh gosh i forget why i- i guess i
sw3180A-ms98-a-0030 212.560000 224.477625 i don't know whether i was trying to consolidate something at that time or some reason i took out a thousand on one card and it wasn't too bad it wasn't but uh one percent or so it was one of the MasterCards i had
sw3180A-ms98-a-0031 224.477625 239.873750 [silence]
sw3180A-ms98-a-0032 239.873750 240.832875 hum
sw3180A-ms98-a-0033 240.832875 263.824000 [silence]
sw3180A-ms98-a-0034 263.824000 265.175875 yeah
sw3180A-ms98-a-0035 265.175875 267.354375 i guess that's the way they
sw3180A-ms98-a-0036 267.354375 273.237750 planned on doing it i can't imagine what i it's been several years i can't imagine what i did to uh
sw3180A-ms98-a-0037 273.237750 275.468375 i do seem to recall
sw3180A-ms98-a-0038 275.468375 277.020875 uh
sw3180A-ms98-a-0039 277.020875 282.160000 oh i- i know what it was there was something i needed to do something i needed to buy either a uh
sw3180A-ms98-a-0040 282.160000 292.512750 gosh i don't know what it i don't think it was a thousand now that i think about it it must have been less than that but something i needed and all the other pla[ces]- places were closed it was after hours as it were and
sw3180A-ms98-a-0041 292.512750 298.786000 there was a little branch office of a bank that was immediately behind our housing development and they were open
