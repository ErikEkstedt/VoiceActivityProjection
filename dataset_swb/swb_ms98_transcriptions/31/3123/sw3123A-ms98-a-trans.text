sw3123A-ms98-a-0022 154.289125 161.250750 well i don't have children in school and it's been so long since i was in school myself i'm not really sure how to answer that
sw3123A-ms98-a-0023 161.250750 169.509625 when uh [noise] i don't know it seems that they're you know that that the difference is between each school i think if it was
sw3123A-ms98-a-0024 169.509625 180.131875 if it could possibly be standardized a little bit that it would be much easier to to gauge you know how uh a particular group of students was doing
sw3123A-ms98-a-0025 180.131875 190.522500 uh the curriculums differ so much and i'm not saying that that's bad necessarily but i think it makes very hard to tell where an actual problem is
sw3123A-ms98-a-0026 190.522500 203.677875 you know you can't really tell from a group of students if it's a if if it's the the teacher that's got the problem or if it's the book that's got the problem you know what the materials that they're using and everything
sw3123A-ms98-a-0027 203.677875 206.367875 that could be causing a problem

sw3123A-ms98-a-0035 257.960125 261.378375 yeah i think that's kind of a good idea because
sw3123A-ms98-a-0036 261.378375 264.060125 you know it doesn't it doesn't
sw3123A-ms98-a-0037 264.060125 267.346750 it doesn't divide people by
sw3123A-ms98-a-0038 267.346750 271.143375 by anything besides what they're interests are
sw3123A-ms98-a-0039 271.143375 279.328875 and it's a mu[ch]- high[er]- it's a learning environment if you're grou[p]- if you're interested in sciences and you're grouped with other people that are interested in sciences
sw3123A-ms98-a-0040 279.328875 283.360375 it seems like it would it would uh it would help
