sw3123B-ms98-a-0003 4.208000 6.790875 uh well
sw3123B-ms98-a-0004 6.790875 13.918500 where i live in Plano one of their big things that they hype it within the community is their school system
sw3123B-ms98-a-0005 13.918500 21.764000 and uh in fact i think that there's some areas of of Dallas and Richardson that are in the those c[ity]- town city limits but they uh
sw3123B-ms98-a-0006 21.764000 28.665500 all of the the housing developments adjoining Plano are in the Plano school district and they use that as one of the things that they
sw3123B-ms98-a-0007 28.665500 34.689625 uh you know that they try to market when they sell homes in that area the fact that it is in Plano schools
sw3123B-ms98-a-0008 34.689625 38.850250 uh i do have children in that school system uh
sw3123B-ms98-a-0009 38.850250 51.216000 and have been personally pleased with that uh i'm not sure that it's that that there's that much glory in the Plano schools versus say Richardson and some of the other areas
sw3123B-ms98-a-0010 51.216000 52.525250 uh
sw3123B-ms98-a-0011 52.525250 56.372250 [silence]
sw3123B-ms98-a-0012 56.372250 57.755625 uh
sw3123B-ms98-a-0013 57.755625 59.775375 [silence]
sw3123B-ms98-a-0014 59.775375 63.684875 probably the biggest controversy within our school system
sw3123B-ms98-a-0015 63.684875 67.490500 is the use of the open classroom concept
sw3123B-ms98-a-0016 67.490500 70.709000 uh where uh
sw3123B-ms98-a-0017 70.709000 83.063250 all uh all the students at a given grade level are in one large area for much of the day uh segregated you know by teacher but not necessarily having walls between the classrooms
sw3123B-ms98-a-0018 83.063250 88.893375 uh i've now had two children that are have been in the s[ystem]- in the system
sw3123B-ms98-a-0019 88.893375 101.877750 uh one who seemed to do just fine in that tap type of atmosphere the other i'm not so sure about because of uh his attention span i think he's a little bit more easily distracted than was she
sw3123B-ms98-a-0020 101.877750 105.896000 and that seems to be the primary complaint uh
sw3123B-ms98-a-0021 105.896000 116.270875 i think my biggest c[omplaint]- problem with the Plano schools right now is that many of the schools do not have cafeterias and kids have to take their lunch back to their classroom to eat
sw3123B-ms98-a-0022 116.270875 120.696750 uh rather than giving them a a break from that area during the day
sw3123B-ms98-a-0023 120.696750 123.324375 uh and
sw3123B-ms98-a-0024 123.324375 125.144000 uh
sw3123B-ms98-a-0025 125.144000 133.387625 that's [laughter] i guess i'm a fairly satisfied uh parent as far as the school system goes myself uh
sw3123B-ms98-a-0026 133.387625 134.737000 that
sw3123B-ms98-a-0027 134.737000 138.913375 that it really boils down to the quality of the teachers
sw3123B-ms98-a-0028 138.913375 150.633125 uh and their interest uh in the students individually is going to make the difference versus you know physical things such as the open classroom versus a more closed classroom
sw3123B-ms98-a-0029 150.633125 154.243875 uh what do you see as problems
sw3123B-ms98-a-0030 154.243875 160.023125 [silence]
sw3123B-ms98-a-0031 160.023125 161.376625 yeah
sw3123B-ms98-a-0032 161.376625 179.331375 [silence]
sw3123B-ms98-a-0033 179.331375 180.665875 right

sw3123B-ms98-a-0035 189.880000 191.239875 uh-huh

sw3123B-ms98-a-0037 202.762125 204.102500 right

sw3123B-ms98-a-0039 206.549375 217.257625 now in in Dallas i know at least at some of the later grade levels they have these magnet schools that i think were initially set up to address the segregation issues
sw3123B-ms98-a-0040 217.257625 226.590125 uh and i wondered uh what the real overall effect on education is of those uh i know i have a niece in the Dallas system that
sw3123B-ms98-a-0041 226.590125 238.438125 is a uh was just elected to go or selected whatever i i think you have to apply and be accepted to these magnet schools but she's interested in the arts and in in particular in dance
sw3123B-ms98-a-0042 238.438125 245.997625 uh they call it a magnet school where it attracts kids of certain interest
sw3123B-ms98-a-0043 245.997625 253.208500 and uh she will be attending i think Skyline Arts Magnet uh or arts and
sw3123B-ms98-a-0044 253.208500 258.442875 something [laughter] magnet school uh next year when she enters high school
sw3123B-ms98-a-0045 258.442875 270.278125 [silence]
sw3123B-ms98-a-0046 270.278125 271.558500 yeah
sw3123B-ms98-a-0047 271.558500 278.409375 [silence]
sw3123B-ms98-a-0048 278.409375 279.776500 uh-huh
sw3123B-ms98-a-0049 279.776500 282.465250 [silence]
sw3123B-ms98-a-0050 282.465250 286.382750 now i would think that would would be a good point as well
sw3123B-ms98-a-0051 286.382750 292.044125 they they don't have that type of thing in Plano they just have these two gargantuan [laughter] high schools
sw3123B-ms98-a-0052 292.044125 301.918750 uh but i do think they do provide some type of special interest focus i think the later years uh for for students
sw3123B-ms98-a-0053 301.918750 313.953875 [silence]
sw3123B-ms98-a-0054 313.953875 315.416500 well
sw3123B-ms98-a-0055 315.416500 320.174375 oh not really uh i've not been that aware of it
sw3123B-ms98-a-0056 320.174375 327.089875 uh i live on it is somewhat divided by east and west Plano with Central Expressway down the middle
sw3123B-ms98-a-0057 327.089875 333.094875 uh and i am on the west side but just barely on the west side i guess my kids are younger than that
sw3123B-ms98-a-0058 333.094875 342.696250 and in they're in the non competitive uh just athletics uh organizations you know your typical soccer and baseball and all that sort of stuff
sw3123B-ms98-a-0059 342.696250 349.816875 and because of where we live uh the teams that my son has been on has have been from both sides of the fence if you will
sw3123B-ms98-a-0060 349.816875 358.200375 they've drawn from both sides and i really haven't sensed any of that yet i it may become more obvious to me in later on
sw3123B-ms98-a-0061 358.200375 363.772500 i think the one of the more interesting things in Plano is that they have high schools and senior high schools
sw3123B-ms98-a-0062 363.772500 367.019625 which a lot of people don't realize that
sw3123B-ms98-a-0063 367.019625 377.553375 that ninth and tenth grade go to high schools of which there there are quite a few in Plano and the senior high schools are only the eleventh and twelfth grade
sw3123B-ms98-a-0064 377.553375 378.815500 [silence]
sw3123B-ms98-a-0065 378.815500 384.608875 yeah that's was very different uh they have middle school sixth seventh and eighth
sw3123B-ms98-a-0066 384.608875 391.049625 and then they'll have uh fact they have a couple of huge schools that are actually almost all
sw3123B-ms98-a-0067 391.049625 395.242875 middle school and elementary school all of those grades in one building
sw3123B-ms98-a-0068 395.242875 396.842750 but uh
sw3123B-ms98-a-0069 396.842750 398.771375 for the most part
sw3123B-ms98-a-0070 398.771375 410.400125 yeah bunch of elementary and they typically feed certain middle schools for sixth seventh and eighth and then there a number at least i could probably think of six 
sw3123B-ms98-a-0071 410.400125 412.470625 high schools
sw3123B-ms98-a-0072 412.470625 413.943500 [silence]
sw3123B-ms98-a-0073 413.943500 418.361375 Shepton is a high school
sw3123B-ms98-a-0074 418.361375 420.563375 ninth and tenth
sw3123B-ms98-a-0075 420.563375 429.511250 and uh there's Shepton and Vines and Wilson or Williams and there's Clark and
sw3123B-ms98-a-0076 429.511250 440.241500 i don't know whether there's more than four i want to say that there are more than just four but uh it's just ninth and tenth grade and then the the two senior high schools are just eleventh and twelfth graders
sw3123B-ms98-a-0077 440.241500 443.634250 which is a sort of a different concept
sw3123B-ms98-a-0078 443.634250 445.144250 [silence]
sw3123B-ms98-a-0079 445.144250 449.654750 and they're they're just so big i'm a little bothered by that uh just the sh[eer]-
