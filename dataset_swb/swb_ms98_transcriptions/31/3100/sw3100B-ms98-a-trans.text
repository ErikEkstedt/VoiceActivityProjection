sw3100B-ms98-a-0002 1.792625 3.868500 okay
sw3100B-ms98-a-0003 3.868500 7.449625 [silence]
sw3100B-ms98-a-0004 7.449625 13.752375 uh not with my parents although my parents are now in their early seventies
sw3100B-ms98-a-0005 13.752375 24.423125 and uh fortunately they have to this point been very physically healthy and very self sufficient
sw3100B-ms98-a-0006 24.423125 34.781500 and they really looked after themselves [vocalized-noise] and i think considered what they want done as they get older and maybe less able 
sw3100B-ms98-a-0007 34.781500 39.508750 [silence]
sw3100B-ms98-a-0008 39.508750 45.711250 well the it it's more that they've establi[shed]- they when they retired and we're from South Dakota 
sw3100B-ms98-a-0009 45.711250 54.499500 so they retired from the rural farming community into Sioux Falls which is the biggest city in the state
sw3100B-ms98-a-0010 54.499500 65.519625 and set themselves up near medical facilities and i- i can't say i can tell you what they've uh decided as to okay because i think some of that is that
sw3100B-ms98-a-0011 65.519625 74.759375 maybe you think ahead somewhat but you don't uh book those facilities yeah
sw3100B-ms98-a-0012 74.759375 83.521625 [silence]
sw3100B-ms98-a-0013 83.521625 84.646000 uh-huh

sw3100B-ms98-a-0016 89.810375 112.001250 [silence]
sw3100B-ms98-a-0017 112.001250 120.910500 well have they do they recognize the coming and try to make the decision themselves
sw3100B-ms98-a-0018 120.910500 127.636875 [silence]
sw3100B-ms98-a-0019 127.636875 128.611625 uh-huh
sw3100B-ms98-a-0020 128.611625 133.028250 [silence]

sw3100B-ms98-a-0024 150.600375 177.867875 [silence]
sw3100B-ms98-a-0025 177.867875 179.198000 uh-huh

sw3100B-ms98-a-0028 202.154750 232.569875 [silence]
sw3100B-ms98-a-0029 232.569875 244.413875 yeah that is one of the options but uh that is so related to the family situation of the children and
sw3100B-ms98-a-0030 244.413875 256.290250 uh you know i guess not that it's happened in our case in my family because it well i have seen it in their generation it what you do is first see your parents go through it with their parents
sw3100B-ms98-a-0031 256.290250 268.343875 and i would say well at this point um you could say been through all that because i have no no grandparents left uh and it's
sw3100B-ms98-a-0032 268.343875 274.424875 you see all the different options and you see that they all can work uh
sw3100B-ms98-a-0033 274.424875 289.907000 [silence]
sw3100B-ms98-a-0034 289.907000 291.086250 uh-huh
sw3100B-ms98-a-0035 291.086250 294.256250 [silence]
sw3100B-ms98-a-0036 294.256250 308.724500 well if they're uh that's the thing if they're physically able it is a much more pleasant more caring uh situation to be in the home of one of the children
sw3100B-ms98-a-0037 308.724500 323.037125 uh the other side of that is that if the children are no where near where the uh parents had spent their life then in a sense you you have no friends at the new place
sw3100B-ms98-a-0038 323.037125 332.029375 uh in this that you are unless that you develop new friends and uh the best thing is kind of a combination where
sw3100B-ms98-a-0039 332.029375 341.021750 uh the at least one of the children if not several are uh uh back in the area where the parents uh had spent their years and then
sw3100B-ms98-a-0040 341.021750 344.043875 [silence]
sw3100B-ms98-a-0041 344.043875 345.188750 yeah
sw3100B-ms98-a-0042 345.188750 348.010125 [silence]
sw3100B-ms98-a-0043 348.010125 349.156500 uh-huh

sw3100B-ms98-a-0046 367.251000 377.463250 [silence]
sw3100B-ms98-a-0047 377.463250 387.835375 yes well it's it's not an easy choice because it's uh but uh it's something that we all face and we uh 
sw3100B-ms98-a-0048 387.835375 391.747125 [silence]
sw3100B-ms98-a-0049 391.747125 401.873500 yeah but the way society changes it makes it so that uh what was acceptable for our parents and their parents
sw3100B-ms98-a-0050 401.873500 411.718500 uh may not be as workable for us it it's certainly a problem as we as people live older of course as long as you can live a healthy life uh 
sw3100B-ms98-a-0051 411.718500 419.540250 the uh the care is is not near the issue it becomes when you start having the physical problems
sw3100B-ms98-a-0052 419.540250 425.340000 [silence]
sw3100B-ms98-a-0053 425.340000 426.681375 yes
