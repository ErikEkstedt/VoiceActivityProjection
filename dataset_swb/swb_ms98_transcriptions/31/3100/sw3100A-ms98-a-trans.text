sw3100A-ms98-a-0013 55.150000 70.590750 [silence]
sw3100A-ms98-a-0014 70.590750 84.507500 right and it depends on their health too i know some people say they never want to go to a nursing home you know where others say well you know put me there [laughter-if] [laughter-i] [laughter-get] [laughter-that] [laughter-bad] [laughter-you] [laughter-know]
sw3100A-ms98-a-0015 84.507500 89.172000 now my parents are seventy nine and eighty one
sw3100A-ms98-a-0016 89.172000 91.982875 and they're they're still
sw3100A-ms98-a-0017 91.982875 95.218125 taking care of themselves but
sw3100A-ms98-a-0018 95.218125 104.322625 when they were your parents age they were doing much better now it's gotten to where it's just barely and we know it's going to be probably
sw3100A-ms98-a-0019 104.322625 108.711125 anytime you know that that we're going to have to
sw3100A-ms98-a-0020 108.711125 112.434125 change them from their home or something you know
sw3100A-ms98-a-0021 112.434125 120.633375 [silence]
sw3100A-ms98-a-0022 120.633375 133.497250 no my stepfather is one that's always had a horror of nursing homes and don't ever put me there now my mother on the other hand i don't think would mind you know 
sw3100A-ms98-a-0023 133.497250 140.626875 uh they live in a small town uh a hundred and twenty miles northeast of Dallas and uh
sw3100A-ms98-a-0024 140.626875 155.619000 and so the nursing home there if if they had to go there there would be some of their old friends there you know and it's and rather than in a city where you probably wouldn't know anyone so that would be to their
sw3100A-ms98-a-0025 155.619000 165.156875 advantage but uh i guess you know i don't know how long i have a brother and two stepsisters but
sw3100A-ms98-a-0026 165.156875 178.846750 we really haven't really discussed it that much either we should have by this point you know at seventy nine and eighty one but i guess we're just waiting to see what happens and then i guess we'll make a make decisions then
sw3100A-ms98-a-0027 178.846750 191.697250 and uh but my stepfather's health is is failing bad you know i don't know if he has starting of Alzheimer or
sw3100A-ms98-a-0028 191.697250 200.789250 or what but the last say three years since he had to have some kind of brain surgery he's been going down hill you know
sw3100A-ms98-a-0029 200.789250 213.783125 and uh so anyway i uh by this time we should have probably made some decisions but we haven't so i- i can see a lot of friends
sw3100A-ms98-a-0030 213.783125 224.419625 here in the neighborhood too uh one's mother just got to where she couldn't take care of herself anymore in Florida as far as you know eating meals and
sw3100A-ms98-a-0031 224.419625 234.173750 all that kind of stuff she just wasn't doing it you know so she has come to live with her daughter in the neighborhood
sw3100A-ms98-a-0032 234.173750 255.464875 [silence]
sw3100A-ms98-a-0033 255.464875 257.137375 uh-huh

sw3100A-ms98-a-0036 271.581500 273.745000 [silence]
sw3100A-ms98-a-0037 273.745000 280.294375 i've almost been surprised the last three or four years with my friends in the neighborhood as many
sw3100A-ms98-a-0038 280.294375 294.458000 mothers it's always been mothers have come to live in the home but then maybe they'll have a stroke or something and and then then they'll go to the nursing home but they go to the home first
sw3100A-ms98-a-0039 294.458000 307.831125 [silence]
sw3100A-ms98-a-0040 307.831125 309.590000 uh-huh

sw3100A-ms98-a-0043 324.709875 340.551625 [silence]
sw3100A-ms98-a-0044 340.551625 348.529500 that would make it easier yeah if if you were but like you say then to uproot them_1 and take them_1 to another state or something
sw3100A-ms98-a-0045 348.529500 349.997000 [silence]
sw3100A-ms98-a-0046 349.997000 359.529625 but uh in some of the cases i was talking about_1 in the neighborhood though they have been up rooted from another state but then but then maybe things
sw3100A-ms98-a-0047 359.529625 366.794500 had gotten where they live that they never really saw anybody much any more anyway you know
sw3100A-ms98-a-0048 366.794500 372.776000 too uh they you know get to where they don't get out that much anymore
sw3100A-ms98-a-0049 372.776000 377.868125 maybe especially_1 if they hadn't always lived in that area they're moving from
sw3100A-ms98-a-0050 377.868125 385.530875 [silence]
sw3100A-ms98-a-0051 385.530875 386.832875 right

sw3100A-ms98-a-0053 387.899500 394.724875 and then and then it's our [laughter-turn] so we better [vocalized-noise] better handle it [laughter-well] [laughter-because] [laughter-it] [vocalized-noise] be 
sw3100A-ms98-a-0054 394.724875 418.683375 [silence]
sw3100A-ms98-a-0055 418.683375 425.547000 right and of course one thing we haven't even discussed that makes a big bearing on what you do is the cost
sw3100A-ms98-a-0056 425.547000 434.118000 you know if the parents if they we[re]- are going into some kind of of nursing type home you know that 
sw3100A-ms98-a-0057 434.118000 445.480375 helps helps them uh you know do they have the money to pay for it or are the children going to help out to make up the difference
sw3100A-ms98-a-0058 445.480375 449.831875 you know if there's two parents that might be three thousand
