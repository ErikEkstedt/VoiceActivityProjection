sw3153B-ms98-a-0002 0.970250 4.694000 [silence]
sw3153B-ms98-a-0003 4.694000 14.872750 well uh i agree that they have problems but i- i'm afraid i'm very much against universal health [laughter] um my daughter is uh
sw3153B-ms98-a-0004 14.872750 22.770500 uh stationed in England right now and of course you know they've had uh group health uh over there for some time um
sw3153B-ms98-a-0005 22.770500 29.037875 i was over there las[t]- uh a year ago when my granddaughter was born
sw3153B-ms98-a-0006 29.037875 39.043000 and uh she had some problems and uh i was horrified from beginning to end [laughter] first of all they are about fifty years behind
sw3153B-ms98-a-0007 39.043000 51.852500 they don't have and their medical technology the doctors since they aren't responsible really to each patient don't feel they have to sit down and talk to you about the problems
sw3153B-ms98-a-0008 51.852500 60.291500 when they want to do something to a patient whether the patient is a few days old or eighty or ninety they do it they don't ask permission
sw3153B-ms98-a-0009 60.291500 70.433375 my daughter went um upstairs into intensive care to see the baby and they were doing surgery on the baby and she didn't even know they were going to do surgery on the baby uh
sw3153B-ms98-a-0010 70.433375 81.509750 yes it was it was really terrible [laughter-that's] why i went over there i mean she was she cried she called and was you know really you know upset um the day we were leaving the hospital finally
sw3153B-ms98-a-0011 81.509750 94.067375 um we were getting all ready to go home and finally you know the baby was okay and everything was fine and the doctor that had been working with her poked his head in the door and he said by the way he said in six weeks he want you to come back uh
sw3153B-ms98-a-0012 94.067375 100.808125 for a t[est]- uh uh a test that we want to do on on her um for uh uh
sw3153B-ms98-a-0013 100.808125 102.839000 multiple sclerosis
sw3153B-ms98-a-0014 102.839000 105.396250 and he turned around and left
sw3153B-ms98-a-0015 105.396250 108.564375 and we just kind of looked at each other and said what
sw3153B-ms98-a-0016 108.564375 113.385000 uh for what and i i tried for fifteen minutes to find the doctor and he was unavailable
sw3153B-ms98-a-0017 113.385000 123.234375 so uh i've had some bad experiences with [laughter-it] [laughter-i] [laughter-i] perhaps not you know uh i don't know a good solution do you have any ideas
sw3153B-ms98-a-0018 123.234375 127.864750 [vocalized-noise]
sw3153B-ms98-a-0019 127.864750 140.699875 [vocalized-noise] well the the thing is these are the HMO's that they have now which are cheaper and you can in my daugh[ter]- my other daughter belongs to an HMO or they used to thankfully they've just changed um you don't
sw3153B-ms98-a-0020 140.699875 151.814500 you only get a choice of doctors that are in your area not necessarily of doctors that are good or not uh see i i've worked for i worked for Johns Hopkins for two years
sw3153B-ms98-a-0021 151.814500 157.305375 uh at the hospital there and i've worked for a private doctor for two years and um
sw3153B-ms98-a-0022 157.305375 170.693375 i got to slap in the face as far as the medical profession was concerned in the United States uh now the doctor that i worked for was good but there was another one in our complex that uh she didn't feel should even be practicing medicine [laughter-and] [laughter-i] [laughter-said] well why don't they
sw3153B-ms98-a-0023 170.693375 178.759625 get him out of there she said well he hasn't done anything wrong it's just that he has poor judgment and i thought oh gosh i mean you're the doctor telling you this you know um
sw3153B-ms98-a-0024 178.759625 187.368250 some horror stories like that but then when with the HMO um the they sent her to a pediatrician that had one gentleman that was uh
sw3153B-ms98-a-0025 187.368250 189.473625 uh in his late seventies
sw3153B-ms98-a-0026 189.473625 194.676250 and an Indian doctor that she couldn't understand and that had no patience with children
sw3153B-ms98-a-0027 194.676250 200.532000 and you know it was kind of that was kind of a bad experience too so when they changed she finally got
sw3153B-ms98-a-0028 200.532000 204.671875 you know a good pediatrician but uh uh it it it's
sw3153B-ms98-a-0029 204.671875 212.089375 it's just a little scary when you don't have as much when you can't just go say hey here's a good doctor i'm going to go to this doctor you know um
sw3153B-ms98-a-0030 212.089375 224.444250 and i i fear that the doctors are going to not be as you know right now they're in a lot of fierce competition [laughter] so they they keep up to date you know at least most of them the good ones
sw3153B-ms98-a-0031 224.444250 235.303375 um i- i i don't know i just fear that uh that it may go downhill if we do indeed you know change to something like that uh
sw3153B-ms98-a-0032 235.303375 237.917000 no it doesn't uh also
sw3153B-ms98-a-0033 237.917000 245.741375 uh we uh my husband was a civilian but we were uh stationed overseas for a while and so i had to go to
sw3153B-ms98-a-0034 245.741375 252.284000 myself and the children had to go do military doctors huh wow [laughter] now that's another story you know so but it's the same
sw3153B-ms98-a-0035 252.284000 265.033500 same thing i mean these doctors didn't want to be here okay they were [forfilling/fulfilling] fulfilling their military obligations and you know they uh of course i guess if you a doctor gets into the field you know they uh
sw3153B-ms98-a-0036 265.033500 269.791000 well enjoy the field but um th[e]- i have found
sw3153B-ms98-a-0037 269.791000 279.964000 uh through people that i know that have HMO's that most of the doctors that they see there may be one or two good ones and the rest of them are either foreign speaking
sw3153B-ms98-a-0038 279.964000 286.934250 i mean not speaking but like Indian doctors you can't understand them because of their their um uh accent
sw3153B-ms98-a-0039 286.934250 296.815625 uh or uh Chinese or and i have nothing against them in fact i went to a doctor for years that was a Chinese doctor but i could understand what he was saying
sw3153B-ms98-a-0040 296.815625 307.720125 you know so i just it just this is a bad subject for me to be on [laughter] only because i've had some real bad experiences and i've known some people that have uh
sw3153B-ms98-a-0041 307.720125 311.517875 [silence]
sw3153B-ms98-a-0042 311.517875 312.804875 [vocalized-noise] been
sw3153B-ms98-a-0043 312.804875 316.663000 [silence]
sw3153B-ms98-a-0044 316.663000 319.561000 right well i'll tell you now what you do
sw3153B-ms98-a-0045 319.561000 323.354000 is you go uh to the doctors and just meet them
sw3153B-ms98-a-0046 323.354000 331.082000 and get feel on you know you can usually tell if you go to a doctor and if you give him
sw3153B-ms98-a-0047 331.082000 341.373875 i don't know some ache or pain or just how they you know reply um uh if they're going to be good or not the doctor that will sit down and talk to you and that will you know do things like that uh 
sw3153B-ms98-a-0048 341.373875 343.990875 is uh uh
sw3153B-ms98-a-0049 343.990875 348.539875 is usually pretty good but uh uh you know y[ou]- i'd try him out
sw3153B-ms98-a-0050 348.539875 357.556750 [silence]
sw3153B-ms98-a-0051 357.556750 361.109125 yeah oh it shou[ld]- okay see that's it
sw3153B-ms98-a-0052 361.109125 366.737125 [silence]
sw3153B-ms98-a-0053 366.737125 371.688375 yeah so that's see that's what scares me about going into universal health
sw3153B-ms98-a-0054 371.688375 384.511500 okay [laughter] i mean [vocalized-noise] you could [laughter] you could really be in serious [laughter-trouble] if you wait to see one of the ones that you feel are better if uh uh you know if we went to that and that was all there was
sw3153B-ms98-a-0055 384.511500 386.962500 um uh
sw3153B-ms98-a-0056 386.962500 388.250125 [silence]
sw3153B-ms98-a-0057 388.250125 395.686625 oh [laughter-well] they don't [laughter] it would it would still be like it is now um the ones in your area
sw3153B-ms98-a-0058 395.686625 404.593000 you know and that would be closest to where you live uh and you know those are the ones that you would see i mean i would presume um
sw3153B-ms98-a-0059 404.593000 411.052375 but uh but also now in England how they work it is you go to see a regular MD
sw3153B-ms98-a-0060 411.052375 420.476000 if he determines that it's necessary then he'll send you to a gynecologist or a surgeon or you know you can't just go there
sw3153B-ms98-a-0061 420.476000 421.937750 uh
sw3153B-ms98-a-0062 421.937750 427.375375 [silence]
sw3153B-ms98-a-0063 427.375375 428.419875 yes
sw3153B-ms98-a-0064 428.419875 429.469500 [silence]
sw3153B-ms98-a-0065 429.469500 430.797000 um-hum

sw3153B-ms98-a-0070 439.071000 447.574375 that's right and uh i mean you know that could potentially be um
sw3153B-ms98-a-0071 447.574375 448.982000 rather
