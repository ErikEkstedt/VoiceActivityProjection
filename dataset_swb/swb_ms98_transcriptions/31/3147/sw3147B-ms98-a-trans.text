sw3147B-ms98-a-0024 96.915375 102.619375 yeah i i think there's a lot of that when you go to a school with two thousand kids there
sw3147B-ms98-a-0025 102.619375 106.837375 suddenly a college that's small seems i'm going backwards

sw3147B-ms98-a-0027 107.942875 109.211000 so

sw3147B-ms98-a-0044 184.422125 187.529750 well i think it was
sw3147B-ms98-a-0045 187.529750 189.512500 well a little bit of
sw3147B-ms98-a-0046 189.512500 196.341500 she narrowed it pretty rapidly to eliminate the real big ones Texas and A&M
sw3147B-ms98-a-0047 196.341500 202.625250 and then it kind of got to be a combination of what she thought she wanted to do and uh
sw3147B-ms98-a-0048 202.625250 210.165000 the uh quality of the program it it you know Baylor was kind of always at the lead there for uh for some time
sw3147B-ms98-a-0049 210.165000 212.585500 uh she looked at Austin College
sw3147B-ms98-a-0050 212.585500 217.102250 i think she applied at Trinity but she really wasn't applying at any of the state schools
sw3147B-ms98-a-0051 217.102250 218.266125 [silence]
sw3147B-ms98-a-0052 218.266125 220.726625 um accounting
sw3147B-ms98-a-0053 220.726625 231.334750 so it was a bit of of the major but not a whole lot there's a lot of campuses have business majors so that was not a big deal for her
sw3147B-ms98-a-0054 231.334750 243.253000 but she just uh it was sort of her choice and i think it was a little bit of we visited there and she visited some because her high school boyfriend's sister was there so she had spent some time there and
sw3147B-ms98-a-0055 243.253000 252.044875 felt pretty comfortable she she looked at Austin College but i think again it was the the size aspect it was just too small for somebody
sw3147B-ms98-a-0056 252.044875 256.834250 coming from Plano unless you you really felt you needed something smaller
sw3147B-ms98-a-0057 256.834250 258.244875 [silence]
sw3147B-ms98-a-0058 258.244875 259.287500 so its
sw3147B-ms98-a-0059 259.287500 260.515875 [silence]
sw3147B-ms98-a-0060 260.515875 263.254125 uh about uh eleven thousand
sw3147B-ms98-a-0061 263.254125 264.417875 yeah
sw3147B-ms98-a-0062 264.417875 268.020125 so it's uh it's sizeable but it's
sw3147B-ms98-a-0063 268.020125 270.762000 it's sort of in the not giant size
sw3147B-ms98-a-0064 270.762000 273.475375 [silence]
sw3147B-ms98-a-0065 273.475375 274.665875 yeah
sw3147B-ms98-a-0066 274.665875 280.646000 yeah in the case of your kids that i i guess with Jennifer it was more
sw3147B-ms98-a-0067 280.646000 282.607125 uh that
sw3147B-ms98-a-0068 282.607125 293.148875 she was making her own choice which i kind of feel is one of the keys if they're going to go do it they better they better decide where with uh
sw3147B-ms98-a-0069 293.148875 294.608875 [silence]
sw3147B-ms98-a-0070 294.608875 295.807250 yeah

sw3147B-ms98-a-0079 340.773625 351.899750 yeah well it seems uh i don't know of a whole bunch of kids who uh really do what their father did there's some i think doctors may be a place where and i don't know quite why
sw3147B-ms98-a-0080 351.899750 355.446125 that sons often follow Dad
sw3147B-ms98-a-0081 355.446125 362.246625 into the profession and maybe that's some of it takes Dad's pull to get an in and other [laughter] folks can't get in as easily
sw3147B-ms98-a-0082 362.246625 363.958375 [silence]
sw3147B-ms98-a-0083 363.958375 367.451375 but uh i don't have any kids who want to become engineers
sw3147B-ms98-a-0084 367.451375 368.928625 uh
sw3147B-ms98-a-0085 368.928625 370.596375 so uh
sw3147B-ms98-a-0086 370.596375 372.366125 you just kind of live with it
sw3147B-ms98-a-0087 372.366125 375.522625 [silence]

sw3147B-ms98-a-0094 397.934250 407.870500 yeah well that's the key to it is that enjoying what you're doing and uh you know i think the folks i see having more trouble picking colleges are
sw3147B-ms98-a-0095 407.870500 414.015625 i got some friends who at Arco there who uh well they're from back east and uh
sw3147B-ms98-a-0096 414.015625 418.315500 and uh their kids are are looking in on some of those eastern private schools
sw3147B-ms98-a-0097 418.315500 422.688625 when you start looking at the twenty to thirty thousand dollar price tag and you
sw3147B-ms98-a-0098 422.688625 427.215875 start saying well do you really have to go there to get what you want [laughter]
sw3147B-ms98-a-0099 427.215875 434.849125 [silence]
sw3147B-ms98-a-0100 434.849125 436.422250 uh-huh
sw3147B-ms98-a-0101 436.422250 440.875500 but they're from back east and they got a lot of relatives there so it's uh
sw3147B-ms98-a-0102 440.875500 442.501375 some of them do that
