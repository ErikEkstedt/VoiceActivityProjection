sw3147A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.745625 [noise]
sw3147A-ms98-a-0002 0.745625 2.074875 well
sw3147A-ms98-a-0003 2.074875 5.190250 let's see we're going to talk about uh
sw3147A-ms98-a-0004 5.190250 6.459750 kids
sw3147A-ms98-a-0005 6.459750 8.830125 how to pick one right
sw3147A-ms98-a-0006 8.830125 10.629125 well it
sw3147A-ms98-a-0007 10.629125 13.689375 uh three times yeah
sw3147A-ms98-a-0008 13.689375 15.829500 [silence]
sw3147A-ms98-a-0009 15.829500 17.247000 well if
sw3147A-ms98-a-0010 17.247000 22.410875 well with uh John the first one he wanted to go into engineering so
sw3147A-ms98-a-0011 22.410875 24.185250 uh
sw3147A-ms98-a-0012 24.185250 34.195375 he had never really lived in a large town so we looked at good engineering schools in relatively small towns like Purdue
sw3147A-ms98-a-0013 34.195375 38.185500 in uh Lafayette Indiana we looked at uh
sw3147A-ms98-a-0014 38.185500 41.899750 Clemson and VPI [vocalized-noise]
sw3147A-ms98-a-0015 41.899750 44.851625 we were living in in north Alabama at the time
sw3147A-ms98-a-0016 44.851625 56.371500 and uh we looked at Mississippi State which was in a small town in Mississippi and uh finally settled on Auburn which was in Alabama in the small town of Auburn
sw3147A-ms98-a-0017 56.371500 58.211250 and uh
sw3147A-ms98-a-0018 58.211250 62.133500 we also wanted a school that had a uh coop program
sw3147A-ms98-a-0019 62.133500 71.311375 because uh he wanted to go into engineering and we thought that a coop program was a good way to get some experience at the same time
sw3147A-ms98-a-0020 71.311375 80.811875 so that was kind of how uh we finally settled on small town and good engineering school with a coop program for him for Brian
sw3147A-ms98-a-0021 80.811875 86.446625 it that was kind of funny because he first started out thinking uh
sw3147A-ms98-a-0022 86.446625 94.156875 that he wanted to go to a small school that's what he thought when we lived in Alabama and then he moved to Plano and went to Senior High
sw3147A-ms98-a-0023 94.156875 99.119625 he figured if i can go to Senior High i can go to school any place [laughter]
sw3147A-ms98-a-0024 99.119625 102.001875 [silence]
sw3147A-ms98-a-0025 102.001875 103.380125 that's right
sw3147A-ms98-a-0026 103.380125 106.432250 [silence]
sw3147A-ms98-a-0027 106.432250 107.819125 yeah
sw3147A-ms98-a-0028 107.819125 109.510625 so he ended up
sw3147A-ms98-a-0029 109.510625 115.127000 uh i don't remember what his original major was because_1 he changed it about three times
sw3147A-ms98-a-0030 115.127000 120.291500 at A&M but he ended up going to A&M i think because of
sw3147A-ms98-a-0031 120.291500 125.878625 uh he just thoroughly enjoyed the uh the atmosphere down there when he went down for a trip
sw3147A-ms98-a-0032 125.878625 128.986000 and uh he was sold on the place
sw3147A-ms98-a-0033 128.986000 133.991500 Jana i think wanted to to stick a little closer to home
sw3147A-ms98-a-0034 133.991500 139.622125 and really didn't have a major when she went in in fact
sw3147A-ms98-a-0035 139.622125 153.148250 i think that was somewhat of a a default because her grades were not as good as uh Brian and John's in high school so she was somewhat limited in her in her choices to places like Stephen F and
sw3147A-ms98-a-0036 153.148250 157.603125 North Texas and maybe UTA and uh
sw3147A-ms98-a-0037 157.603125 161.255125 she had some idea that she might want to uh
sw3147A-ms98-a-0038 161.255125 172.597875 do something with uh physical therapy and TWU was also up in uh in Denton so if she started at one she could move to the other and might not even have to move out of her apartment
sw3147A-ms98-a-0039 172.597875 181.122500 so it was kind of close to home and there were two schools in town that uh she could commute back and forth between the two
sw3147A-ms98-a-0040 181.122500 182.886250 how did uh
sw3147A-ms98-a-0041 182.886250 185.111375 your gal picked Baylor
sw3147A-ms98-a-0042 185.111375 195.519750 [silence]
sw3147A-ms98-a-0043 195.519750 196.760500 yeah
sw3147A-ms98-a-0044 196.760500 217.047125 [silence]
sw3147A-ms98-a-0045 217.047125 218.896250 oh what's her major
sw3147A-ms98-a-0046 218.896250 219.993250 [silence]
sw3147A-ms98-a-0047 219.993250 220.978125 uh-huh 
sw3147A-ms98-a-0048 220.978125 227.998250 [silence]
sw3147A-ms98-a-0049 227.998250 229.025625 sure
sw3147A-ms98-a-0050 229.025625 242.408500 [silence]
sw3147A-ms98-a-0051 242.408500 243.484625 i see
sw3147A-ms98-a-0052 243.484625 252.081000 [silence]
sw3147A-ms98-a-0053 252.081000 254.299500 good one in Plano yeah
sw3147A-ms98-a-0054 254.299500 256.485125 [silence]
sw3147A-ms98-a-0055 256.485125 257.892500 yeah
sw3147A-ms98-a-0056 257.892500 261.315500 what is the population of Baylor i don't even know
sw3147A-ms98-a-0057 261.315500 262.650750 [silence]
sw3147A-ms98-a-0058 262.650750 264.485500 oh is it okay
sw3147A-ms98-a-0059 264.485500 269.975500 [silence]
sw3147A-ms98-a-0060 269.975500 274.659750 yeah yeah not like uh Austin and College Station
sw3147A-ms98-a-0061 274.659750 292.531000 [silence]
sw3147A-ms98-a-0062 292.531000 295.445625 yeah it needs to be a place they want to go
sw3147A-ms98-a-0063 295.445625 306.029625 uh if they're going to be successful if they think Mom and Dad picked it or they're going there because that's where Mom and Dad went and that's what they want them to do uh that's the wrong reason for picking a place
sw3147A-ms98-a-0064 306.029625 309.505000 that's kind of the way Brian picked his first major i think he
sw3147A-ms98-a-0065 309.505000 324.210125 without asking me he thought because i was in computer science that he should do the same thing and so he started out in that arena and didn't really care for it and finally asked if i would mind if he changed and i said
sw3147A-ms98-a-0066 324.210125 331.375125 not at all because y[ou]- you want to find something that you like to do not necessarily what your Dad does
sw3147A-ms98-a-0067 331.375125 332.871125 so uh
sw3147A-ms98-a-0068 332.871125 341.307500 he felt a little easier about that after uh after i told him it wouldn't upset me at all if he found something that he wanted to do rather then copy what i did
sw3147A-ms98-a-0069 341.307500 355.015500 [silence]
sw3147A-ms98-a-0070 355.015500 356.454125 uh-huh
sw3147A-ms98-a-0071 356.454125 361.497375 [silence]
sw3147A-ms98-a-0072 361.497375 363.200375 well that could be
sw3147A-ms98-a-0073 363.200375 366.766125 [silence]
sw3147A-ms98-a-0074 366.766125 368.754750 [laughter]
sw3147A-ms98-a-0075 368.754750 372.051250 [silence]
sw3147A-ms98-a-0076 372.051250 373.331500 sure
sw3147A-ms98-a-0077 373.331500 377.348250 well and they they need to do something that they think they will enjoy [noise]
sw3147A-ms98-a-0078 377.348250 378.671375 and uh
sw3147A-ms98-a-0079 378.671375 388.503375 uh like i told Jana once she finally settled on a major she just did so much better in college than she did in high school once she found something to get excited about
sw3147A-ms98-a-0080 388.503375 395.262875 and uh whether she ever makes a lot of money at it or not is is immaterial if she enjoys it and is good at it
sw3147A-ms98-a-0081 395.262875 398.240625 and uh so far i think she is
sw3147A-ms98-a-0082 398.240625 417.618250 [silence]
sw3147A-ms98-a-0083 417.618250 418.680000 uh-huh
sw3147A-ms98-a-0084 418.680000 421.758750 [silence]
sw3147A-ms98-a-0085 421.758750 422.763000 oh i know it
sw3147A-ms98-a-0086 422.763000 426.214500 [silence]
sw3147A-ms98-a-0087 426.214500 435.384500 that's right i mean it would be nice if you could but you you can be successful without necessarily having a uh a degree from an Eastern school
sw3147A-ms98-a-0088 435.384500 441.686125 [silence]
sw3147A-ms98-a-0089 441.686125 442.955375 uh-huh
sw3147A-ms98-a-0090 442.955375 448.267375 well they feel some uh some peer pressure from their peers the parents do sometimes
sw3147A-ms98-a-0091 448.267375 449.539250 [silence]
