sw3181A-ms98-a-0013 50.687000 55.799500 yes well i walk two and a half to three miles every night
sw3181A-ms98-a-0014 55.799500 64.376625 my husband and i were on Nutrisystem about eighteen months ago and he lost sixty two pounds and i lost twenty one
sw3181A-ms98-a-0015 64.376625 75.461250 so we've decided to maintain our weight that we will do this exercise walking program and we walk our dog every night and go up around the elementary school we have a little path that we do
sw3181A-ms98-a-0016 75.461250 83.656625 and uh except if it's raining or real cold which it hasn't been we try to get out um every every night
sw3181A-ms98-a-0017 83.656625 92.329250 and he plays racquetball twice a week but i'm not into that so i think the walking is enough to help us stay in shape and toned

sw3181A-ms98-a-0022 121.533500 127.013000 so my kids luckily are old enough i can leave them at home alone while i go out and walk

sw3181A-ms98-a-0028 136.419375 147.834375 no my husband never was either until he lost the weight that was his decision he had arthritis in his hips and his doctor said he needed to lose weight and exercise
sw3181A-ms98-a-0029 147.834375 156.414000 so once he got motivated now he's ready to walk every night and our dog has lost a little weight he walks every night [laughter-too]
sw3181A-ms98-a-0030 156.414000 162.176625 so he gets excited when he sees us put on our our shoes our walking shoes
