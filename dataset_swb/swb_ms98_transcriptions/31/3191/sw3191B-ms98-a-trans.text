sw3191B-ms98-a-0005 9.703750 14.961625 uh well uh we may um my grandmother before very short time um
sw3191B-ms98-a-0006 14.961625 20.605875 she uh she was just more or less in a in a nursing home for uh recovery from a broken hip
sw3191B-ms98-a-0007 20.605875 29.216750 because she could receive more medical attention but um that physical therapy was there and whatever but i think in visiting her there
sw3191B-ms98-a-0008 29.216750 40.305250 um it was very obvious to see that a lot of the people in the nursing home that she was in uh weren't there mentally uh she was probably the only person in the um
sw3191B-ms98-a-0009 40.305250 48.622750 whole nursing home [laughter] that uh still had all of her mental facilities about her so that was uh that was very disheartening
sw3191B-ms98-a-0010 48.622750 53.009875 [silence]
sw3191B-ms98-a-0011 53.009875 57.370000 oh yeah it's really hard i guess i- i come from a family of um
sw3191B-ms98-a-0012 57.370000 69.109625 of uh take care of your elders i I guess um my my dad's mother is an invalid and she lives with my aunt and uncle and they care for her you know all around the clock though she's not
sw3191B-ms98-a-0013 69.109625 75.154750 uh she doesn't have to receive constant medical attention she because of arthritis she's just unable to get out of bed
sw3191B-ms98-a-0014 75.154750 86.181750 so i guess you know there's that family commitment um i know that my parents my mother's trying to let my grandmother stay in her house as long as she can
sw3191B-ms98-a-0015 86.181750 87.910125 um
sw3191B-ms98-a-0016 87.910125 88.943375 [silence]

sw3191B-ms98-a-0021 103.058375 111.396250 yeah well probably i think as long as the person's able to um to understand what's going on around them and i think
sw3191B-ms98-a-0022 111.396250 116.612625 you know my grandmother right now still able to walk around and she's still able to um [noise]
sw3191B-ms98-a-0023 116.612625 122.699125 to do some things for herself though she gets Meals On Wheels which i think is a great thing because um
sw3191B-ms98-a-0024 122.699125 133.083125 it saves people from having to prepare her food for her because you worry a little bit about her leaving a stove on or whatever though she does most things very well it still makes a little bit easier for her
sw3191B-ms98-a-0025 133.083125 134.668875 hum-um

sw3191B-ms98-a-0037 182.378625 187.259375 yeah that i think you know it's really funny i have two grandmothers still alive and my
sw3191B-ms98-a-0038 187.259375 201.007625 my one grandmother says that she wants to stay in her house for as long as possible she's like openly told people she's always been very good about knowing yes she's eighty nine and she said that she really would like to stay in her house as long as possible because it's her home
sw3191B-ms98-a-0039 201.007625 203.867625 but when the time comes um
sw3191B-ms98-a-0040 203.867625 213.482500 she and she can't do things and she has to be cared for or whatever she would prefer and she's actually said this to move into some type of community where she has her own apartment
sw3191B-ms98-a-0041 213.482500 217.965500 uh probably with like a living space and a bedroom with maybe a kitchenette
sw3191B-ms98-a-0042 217.965500 226.360500 so that if she you know if she wants to fix herself something light she can do that but if she wants to go to a meal she can go down the hallway
sw3191B-ms98-a-0043 226.360500 234.344875 uh to a room where there's a cafeteria and there's other people there and she can mix with them and talk with them and enjoy their company

sw3191B-ms98-a-0060 269.107375 276.355500 [noise] yeah i think i think that probably until i[nvalids]- until they're really invalids el[derly]- the elderly are invalids
sw3191B-ms98-a-0061 276.355500 286.104875 i think that they should be able to interact with other people i[n]- in an environment that they choose if they can if the family can afford it i think um and see i know that
sw3191B-ms98-a-0062 286.104875 299.031750 my grandmother would like to stay in her house and my parents actually said you know that they may have to take their end sometime so because you know my grandma actually says who she wants to live with she's pretty you know she lets people know
