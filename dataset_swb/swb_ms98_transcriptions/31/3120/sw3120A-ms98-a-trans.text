sw3120A-ms98-a-0036 126.300625 142.928125 [silence]
sw3120A-ms98-a-0037 142.928125 146.394000 um yeah those um and those were several uh
sw3120A-ms98-a-0038 146.394000 149.984875 that we did consider um my parents
sw3120A-ms98-a-0039 149.984875 153.310125 uh um certainly didn't push but
sw3120A-ms98-a-0040 153.310125 158.004750 wanted me to look in the south and because i had been in a small school
sw3120A-ms98-a-0041 158.004750 163.182750 they suggested that i probably i when i say small my graduating class had eighteen in it
sw3120A-ms98-a-0042 163.182750 169.551000 and so they suggested that i might want a smaller school because i was used to a lot of one-on-one
sw3120A-ms98-a-0043 169.551000 172.700750 um or small group situations and
sw3120A-ms98-a-0044 172.700750 176.888125 i did pick it because at the time i was interested in majoring in
sw3120A-ms98-a-0045 176.888125 180.531000 biology and i also wanted to spend
sw3120A-ms98-a-0046 180.531000 185.513500 one year studying in Europe um i had had an A F S student
sw3120A-ms98-a-0047 185.513500 188.791250 from Germany live with us our senior year
sw3120A-ms98-a-0048 188.791250 192.829125 i and we just thought that would be a wonderful thing and
sw3120A-ms98-a-0049 192.829125 199.419875 i ended up majoring in French one of the reasons i picked the school was because they had a strong science department
sw3120A-ms98-a-0050 199.419875 200.570000 [silence]
sw3120A-ms98-a-0051 200.570000 205.864625 they also had a strong language department and i'd always loved working with children um
sw3120A-ms98-a-0052 205.864625 207.019500 and
sw3120A-ms98-a-0053 207.019500 209.008625 i found that i couldn't
sw3120A-ms98-a-0054 209.008625 210.778875 fit everything in
sw3120A-ms98-a-0055 210.778875 215.265250 but because i had had a fair amount of French going in i was able
sw3120A-ms98-a-0056 215.265250 220.237500 to do my year's study in France and able to take a lot of the other courses that
sw3120A-ms98-a-0057 220.237500 222.175500 interested me um
sw3120A-ms98-a-0058 222.175500 223.389000 [silence]
sw3120A-ms98-a-0059 223.389000 225.252625 and so that was some of but
sw3120A-ms98-a-0060 225.252625 229.339500 several of the things you mentioned were the things that um
sw3120A-ms98-a-0061 229.339500 237.020875 our son has talked a lot about Texas A and M he's but he thinks he wants to be a writer and i don't think that
sw3120A-ms98-a-0062 237.020875 238.280375 [silence]
sw3120A-ms98-a-0063 238.280375 239.783125 yes [laughter]
sw3120A-ms98-a-0064 239.783125 242.213250 um and really his
sw3120A-ms98-a-0065 242.213250 248.419000 his graduating class will probably be in the neighborhood of eight hundred and fifty to a thousand
sw3120A-ms98-a-0066 248.419000 249.586125 um
sw3120A-ms98-a-0067 249.586125 256.432500 and so he's used to a bigger size and because my brother is there
sw3120A-ms98-a-0068 256.432500 262.860500 uh he would have family close by so there there are advantages um but i also
sw3120A-ms98-a-0069 262.860500 263.892500 [silence]
sw3120A-ms98-a-0070 263.892500 267.844500 because i had so many friends who did go from our small school to
sw3120A-ms98-a-0071 267.844500 272.148750 University of Michigan which was so large and they really felt
sw3120A-ms98-a-0072 272.148750 274.731625 um like they were numbers
sw3120A-ms98-a-0073 274.731625 278.489500 [silence]
sw3120A-ms98-a-0074 278.489500 279.785500 you still
sw3120A-ms98-a-0075 279.785500 280.989000 yeah
sw3120A-ms98-a-0076 280.989000 302.411250 [silence]
sw3120A-ms98-a-0077 302.411250 305.315500 well th[at's]- that's certainly um
sw3120A-ms98-a-0078 305.315500 310.807500 especially today with the cost of college i mean that is a a major
sw3120A-ms98-a-0079 310.807500 318.360750 um consideration and i do feel fortunate that Texas has so many good schools and even though Baylor um
sw3120A-ms98-a-0080 318.360750 322.835875 and when you mentioned that we we have friends who have children there
sw3120A-ms98-a-0081 322.835875 330.863875 who just love it and for a private school it is not as expensive as most are and it is a smaller size and
sw3120A-ms98-a-0082 330.863875 332.055125 um
sw3120A-ms98-a-0083 332.055125 333.388625 [silence]
sw3120A-ms98-a-0084 333.388625 336.779375 i do feel like there are a lot of options it's it's
sw3120A-ms98-a-0085 336.779375 342.376500 but [noise] i had been hoping some schools i know give um
sw3120A-ms98-a-0086 342.376500 345.669375 oh even this year Jay had an aptitude
sw3120A-ms98-a-0087 345.669375 347.876250 test um
sw3120A-ms98-a-0088 347.876250 349.367875 [silence]
sw3120A-ms98-a-0089 349.367875 355.771750 yes he thinks that's what he'd like to do but he's really strong in math and science too and
sw3120A-ms98-a-0090 355.771750 361.121000 we keep encouraging him to keep an open mind does your daughter
sw3120A-ms98-a-0091 361.121000 364.247750 know what she'd like to do
sw3120A-ms98-a-0092 364.247750 369.016250 [silence]
sw3120A-ms98-a-0093 369.016250 370.398500 yeah
sw3120A-ms98-a-0094 370.398500 409.466875 [silence]
sw3120A-ms98-a-0095 409.466875 411.116875 yes
sw3120A-ms98-a-0096 411.116875 419.006750 [silence]
sw3120A-ms98-a-0097 419.006750 420.196250 um-hum
sw3120A-ms98-a-0098 420.196250 425.065000 [silence]
sw3120A-ms98-a-0099 425.065000 425.734375 yes
sw3120A-ms98-a-0100 425.734375 433.231750 [silence]
sw3120A-ms98-a-0101 433.231750 440.359375 well he but he has even now that he's in high school um and of course there's there is
sw3120A-ms98-a-0102 440.359375 443.896875 still time but he's beginning to feel that
sw3120A-ms98-a-0103 443.896875 450.153625 as much as he enjoys writing he wonders if he can make a living at it you know it's the it's
