sw3162A-ms98-a-0003 1.200500 6.152500 um [laughter] well it's not such a bad idea to think about judges uh
sw3162A-ms98-a-0004 6.152500 8.903250 you know taking the idea of uh
sw3162A-ms98-a-0005 8.903250 16.491375 uh sentencing in into their hands versus you know the jury especially if it's a highly publicized case
sw3162A-ms98-a-0006 16.491375 25.074250 such as uh you've got cases right now that are going on that everybody's very well informed of or have read uh certain
sw3162A-ms98-a-0007 25.074250 33.656750 uh things in regards to cases like the Dahmer case in Milwaukee and stuff so it's it may be an idea to think about
sw3162A-ms98-a-0008 33.656750 39.337625 you know cost trying to find a jury so you ca[n]- get a jury as far as
sw3162A-ms98-a-0009 39.337625 49.937750 um they may say they're not biased but deep down they are a[gainst]- against this person or whatever so um i don't think it's such a bad idea to think about so

sw3162A-ms98-a-0040 175.598500 177.069500 yeah
sw3162A-ms98-a-0041 177.069500 185.869125 kind of how i you knows in certain cases i can see them going uh uh just basically with a judge guilty or not guilty verdict
sw3162A-ms98-a-0042 185.869125 191.860125 uh simply from a judge in highly publicized cases versus the small
sw3162A-ms98-a-0043 191.860125 195.840000 um maybe uh you did a crime that was uh
sw3162A-ms98-a-0044 195.840000 205.353500 burglary or whatever and it goes into the court case or whatever and it's not highly publicized but when you get into these highly publicized cases
sw3162A-ms98-a-0045 205.353500 210.852125 where everybody knows details whether it's through the National Enquirer or whatever
sw3162A-ms98-a-0046 210.852125 221.764000 um it's the idea that person might initially have this thought well jeez this person's guilty no matter what i'm not gonna listen to the facts or and and
sw3162A-ms98-a-0047 221.764000 234.128500 con their way into uh getting past the lawyers and and getting through that but um also there's the aspect of cost and i i'm not quite sure how much cost it does
sw3162A-ms98-a-0048 234.128500 245.219125 take for uh the judicial system to try and call a jury whether it's uh very costly or if it's something that's not costly or what
sw3162A-ms98-a-0049 245.219125 249.766875 you know being that i'm not in the that area i really don't know but i wonder
sw3162A-ms98-a-0050 249.766875 254.072125 if there is some big expense in trying to call a jury to trial
sw3162A-ms98-a-0051 254.072125 265.514875 and then having to pay whatever they have to pay if there's something that they have to pay i know companies have to pay for these people to be off from work or at lea[st]- give them the time off
sw3162A-ms98-a-0052 265.514875 271.797500 from work uh whether it i think it's with pay if i remember jury duty is with pay
sw3162A-ms98-a-0053 271.797500 274.157750 and uh it's not it
