sw3162B-ms98-a-0005 48.642250 58.550125 right that a that a a a a judge would be more consistent from one case to the next and not not de[pend]- and and uh
sw3162B-ms98-a-0006 58.550125 70.127125 not depend so much on the on the emotions of a particular case but be able to put it in overall perspective well i- i i certainly haven't thought much about this but [vocalized-noise]
sw3162B-ms98-a-0007 70.127125 78.918250 [laughter] [laughter-yes] [laughter-yes] some of them_1 some of them_1 do and some of them_1 don't but uh this one uh
sw3162B-ms98-a-0008 78.918250 86.393250 i was trying to remember back it seems to me that that you know when i studied civics in school or stuff that this
sw3162B-ms98-a-0009 86.393250 91.725250 the juries being involved in the sentencing wasn't wasn't so much and i'm i'm trying to
sw3162B-ms98-a-0010 91.725250 97.030750 figure out whether that's i'm remembering wrong or whether that's a by state

sw3162B-ms98-a-0016 104.301500 110.556250 uh i gue[ss]- i guess [noise] uh and i don't know whether it's by state or whether there's been some
sw3162B-ms98-a-0017 110.556250 121.842500 [noise] Supreme Supreme Court decision perhaps that said that uh that uh as part of the trial by the peers that i had to include the sentencing or too or whatever i'd yeah but i
sw3162B-ms98-a-0018 121.842500 128.970000 yeah i- i certainly wouldn't be uh uh worried about that i guess in terms of the uh
sw3162B-ms98-a-0019 128.970000 138.640125 uh you know ha[ving]- having a judge do it would seem to me to be more more fair and and uh unbiased uh [noise]
sw3162B-ms98-a-0020 138.640125 145.693375 in terms of doing away with the with the unanimous jury i guess i guess i uh
sw3162B-ms98-a-0021 145.693375 159.235125 [noise] would be a little more leery of that kind of a change in in a trial system that that's just a such a tradition that it's a that it's got to be a unanimous jury that uh
sw3162B-ms98-a-0022 159.235125 167.451500 i don't know where you'd where you'd draw the line anywhere else uh you know uh two thirds or three fourths or whatever but uh
sw3162B-ms98-a-0023 167.451500 174.722500 and and i- i- i certainly wouldn't feel comfortable with just a just a bare majority um

sw3162B-ms98-a-0037 279.592500 287.728375 that that's necessarily required uh you know by law that it has to be paid um
sw3162B-ms98-a-0038 287.728375 290.585500 i suspect that's a that's a
sw3162B-ms98-a-0039 290.585500 294.587750 benefit of a bigger company but but there are certainly some
