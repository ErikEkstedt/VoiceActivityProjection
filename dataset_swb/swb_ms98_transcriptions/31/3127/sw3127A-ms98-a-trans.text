sw3127A-ms98-a-0006 27.129750 30.611750 coached some and went to all the games and
sw3127A-ms98-a-0007 30.611750 39.515625 and course in Plano that's a big deal we'd even where we lived in Albuquerque before there's a lot of parent involvement in children's lives

sw3127A-ms98-a-0019 72.271625 81.512500 [vocalized-noise] seems [vocalized-noise] naturally you know just they start so young just kicking the ball and are are you pretty involved with with their uh
sw3127A-ms98-a-0020 81.512500 84.847000 do you coach them_1 or go out to parent nights

sw3127A-ms98-a-0034 117.985375 125.786000 right right i[t]- well that's seems to be a a pretty current trend i i work in the schools and i see a lot of kids that
sw3127A-ms98-a-0035 125.786000 133.097375 obviously are looking for a family and usually find it within a group at school rather than
sw3127A-ms98-a-0036 133.097375 145.885000 at home because their parents are off working or uh us[ually]- you know a lot of times it's a single mother trying to raise and of course i i deal with adolescents so that's where it fourteen fifteen that's where it really starts coming out this
sw3127A-ms98-a-0037 145.885000 149.447750 lack of of uh family life
sw3127A-ms98-a-0038 149.447750 154.872750 [silence]
sw3127A-ms98-a-0039 154.872750 166.721875 well uh they look for their security and their uh self-esteem uh outside of the home and usually in the wrong groups
sw3127A-ms98-a-0040 166.721875 169.073125 and and uh
sw3127A-ms98-a-0041 169.073125 178.245375 right and they find that they're very easily unfortunately uh the kids who make them feel the most welcome
sw3127A-ms98-a-0042 178.245375 186.883750 when new students come into school are the kids that are are uh on drugs or party a lot on weekends and things like that and and uh
sw3127A-ms98-a-0043 186.883750 196.721875 they're the f[irst]- but they are the first ones that will come up and say you know you want to sit at my table in the cafeteria and let me help you to your classes and things like that and and uh
sw3127A-ms98-a-0044 196.721875 207.022875 when you've got a a child that's just coming from a situation a move is a terrible thing on a child it's it's just such a traumatic especially if they've lived for any length of time
sw3127A-ms98-a-0045 207.022875 216.613625 i[n]- in the first place and they come up here and no friends and here are these people just throwing themselves and before you know it you've got a a kid involved in things you don't want them involved in and
sw3127A-ms98-a-0046 216.613625 231.097500 and most of the time the move is made and then mom and daddy go right back to work right away and the kid's coming home to an empty house or they're coming home to take care of little brothers and sisters and and uh you've got these ready made friends just ready to go
sw3127A-ms98-a-0047 231.097500 234.442500 and and uh i y[ou]- i don't know
sw3127A-ms98-a-0048 234.442500 246.013000 what the answer is because i am a working woman and and i don't like to say if the women would stay home any more than i like to say if the men would stay home and and it's
sw3127A-ms98-a-0049 246.013000 247.305000 right w[hen]-
sw3127A-ms98-a-0050 247.305000 248.528125 [silence]
sw3127A-ms98-a-0051 248.528125 256.557500 when my youngest was in third grade i went back to work but i stayed home up until then when by that time my oldest was
sw3127A-ms98-a-0052 256.557500 259.500125 oh she's about
sw3127A-ms98-a-0053 259.500125 260.874000 [silence]
sw3127A-ms98-a-0054 260.874000 264.426000 six years older than he is so she must have been in about uh
sw3127A-ms98-a-0055 264.426000 272.373875 tenth grade i guess my oldest was and i had one in tenth and one in ninth and one in eighth and then this third grader and and uh
sw3127A-ms98-a-0056 272.373875 282.764750 but i went to work for the school district where i was home in the summer i had two weeks off at Christmas i g[ot]- left school at th[ree]- four o'clock every day and was home
sw3127A-ms98-a-0057 282.764750 286.252500 to take them_1 to anything they needed to go to in the afternoons
sw3127A-ms98-a-0058 286.252500 288.974500 [silence]
sw3127A-ms98-a-0059 288.974500 302.999625 uh no in the schools i i uh i did work some summers but it was never my work never took uh first place if if my kids needed me or needed to go somewhere that's where i was
sw3127A-ms98-a-0060 302.999625 304.734125 and
sw3127A-ms98-a-0061 304.734125 311.859375 um i [vocalized-noise] when my youngest was in elementary school i worked at in his elementary school for three years 
sw3127A-ms98-a-0062 311.859375 325.244125 and uh but i had an understanding with the principal that under no circumstances was i to be treated any differently i don't want i said i don't want teachers coming to me in the middle of the day when they couldn't get to anybody else's mother in the middle of the day
sw3127A-ms98-a-0063 325.244125 329.737000 that that it would be handled the same way they h[andled]- dealt with other p[arents]- other kids
sw3127A-ms98-a-0064 329.737000 335.253875 it it gets real easy when a mother is in a school or a father even for a teacher to
sw3127A-ms98-a-0065 335.253875 346.066375 every time some little thing goes wrong to run and pretty soon all you're hearing is negative things so it you know and those things need to be dealt with in the classroom by the teacher and not tattled necessarily
sw3127A-ms98-a-0066 346.066375 347.975375 but it it
sw3127A-ms98-a-0067 347.975375 349.978500 it worked well
sw3127A-ms98-a-0068 349.978500 361.939750 it worked well with me and i and i told the principal i said if if uh my student my child does something that you feel deserves licks or some other discipline have at it [laughter] you know i'm i'm i have always
sw3127A-ms98-a-0069 361.939750 365.718875 wanted them to respect rules and teachers and and uh
sw3127A-ms98-a-0070 365.718875 371.045250 i don't want them to think that i'm going to come riding to the rescue where every time something happens but
sw3127A-ms98-a-0071 371.045250 372.697125 [silence]
sw3127A-ms98-a-0072 372.697125 373.973125 right
sw3127A-ms98-a-0073 373.973125 381.431875 [silence]
sw3127A-ms98-a-0074 381.431875 386.634500 well i think unfortunately what what we're seeing in the very few of the instances is that
sw3127A-ms98-a-0075 386.634500 392.697250 uh for the parents who cannot be there to parent during the day their idea of parenting is
sw3127A-ms98-a-0076 392.697250 397.674875 to come riding to the rescue and take their child's side without knowing
sw3127A-ms98-a-0077 397.674875 401.144875 the whole story or even when they do know the whole story
sw3127A-ms98-a-0078 401.144875 408.267250 it's it's either another student's fault or it's another it's a teacher's fault or i[t's]- it's anybody's and they
sw3127A-ms98-a-0079 408.267250 416.939500 consider that being a good parent and that what if when really what the child needs is their attention more of the time and it's 
sw3127A-ms98-a-0080 416.939500 418.580625 um-hum
sw3127A-ms98-a-0081 418.580625 419.970000 um-hum

sw3127A-ms98-a-0085 424.450625 436.704375 it it it's and i[t's]- it's difficult i understand i i know a lot of single women that are working two jobs just to keep a roof over the kid's head and keep food on the table and i don't know how these women are supposed to have
sw3127A-ms98-a-0086 436.704375 450.676625 time to to parent i[t's]- it's i don't i don't know what the answer is to it it's it's really sad i there may not be i but i[t]- it beats being it beats being homeless [laughter] you know and
