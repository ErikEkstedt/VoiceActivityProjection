sw3134B-ms98-a-0003 6.857250 16.862125 no as many years as we've been involved in one i really feel fortunate in that there even though there are problems they're not a lot of problems where i teach
sw3134B-ms98-a-0004 16.862125 21.404000 but from talking to people in other districts there are some major
sw3134B-ms98-a-0005 21.404000 25.262375 problems uh with dropouts um
sw3134B-ms98-a-0006 25.262375 28.664500 when i was in Minnesota last summer
sw3134B-ms98-a-0007 28.664500 40.441750 there was a teacher who said that uh on a given day she didn't know how many of her students would show up and sometimes they didn't even show up for class and she taught in high school in inner city uh Minneapolis
sw3134B-ms98-a-0008 40.441750 49.693625 and uh they just didn't come to school and i cannot imagine being able to do much of anything when they don't even come to school
sw3134B-ms98-a-0009 49.693625 55.929500 [silence]
sw3134B-ms98-a-0010 55.929500 57.376250 um-hum
sw3134B-ms98-a-0011 57.376250 82.276000 [silence]
sw3134B-ms98-a-0012 82.276000 84.321250 i think so too
sw3134B-ms98-a-0013 84.321250 88.190250 [silence]
sw3134B-ms98-a-0014 88.190250 100.818625 the home is the key i think really is because if the home does not place a high priority on education and um tha[t]- the main goal is making money now
sw3134B-ms98-a-0015 100.818625 109.624875 and it may be a survival thing for the family which you can understand so um right
sw3134B-ms98-a-0016 109.624875 115.824125 [silence]
sw3134B-ms98-a-0017 115.824125 117.625250 your education
sw3134B-ms98-a-0018 117.625250 130.134500 [silence]
sw3134B-ms98-a-0019 130.134500 135.296250 that's right it's what's wrong with families and if if children come to school
sw3134B-ms98-a-0020 135.296250 140.887750 yes insecure and their mo[re]- biggest concern is survival
sw3134B-ms98-a-0021 140.887750 148.491500 both at home they don't know what to expect at home they don't feel secure there they don't know what's going to happen just out front of their
sw3134B-ms98-a-0022 148.491500 152.372625 apartment complex for example that child that was shot
sw3134B-ms98-a-0023 152.372625 157.595500 uh how can they concentrate on schooling i agree with you i think that's the main problem
sw3134B-ms98-a-0024 157.595500 161.716875 and school's now are supposed to solve
sw3134B-ms98-a-0025 161.716875 170.643875 social problems uh mental and emotional problems as well as educate the kids and try to provide them with some security and that's overwhelming
sw3134B-ms98-a-0026 170.643875 183.881250 [silence]
sw3134B-ms98-a-0027 183.881250 186.038375 no it isn't
sw3134B-ms98-a-0028 186.038375 203.864000 [silence]
sw3134B-ms98-a-0029 203.864000 218.662000 true i think they there has to be at least a counselor and we just recently had a counselor at elementary we didn't even have counselors in elementary we have always though had three at middle schools because we had about a thousand kids and
sw3134B-ms98-a-0030 218.662000 221.809750 they divided them up between three counselors but
sw3134B-ms98-a-0031 221.809750 233.369875 for a good while every year they'd have a different counselor and they decided that didn't work so they started uh dividing the kids up so that a counselor stays with her group of counselees
sw3134B-ms98-a-0032 233.369875 238.870875 through you know through all three years of middle school and i think that
sw3134B-ms98-a-0033 238.870875 245.351750 would give them more security in going to the counselor if they have a rapport with their counselor now if they don't
sw3134B-ms98-a-0034 245.351750 257.035250 i hope they have the flexibility to be able to change a child that really is in need of counseling help if they absolutely refuse to work with them on and occasionally that happens
sw3134B-ms98-a-0035 257.035250 261.757500 but it is frightening b[ut]-
sw3134B-ms98-a-0036 261.757500 272.609000 because um education is the key to our future and uh if we have children who are not getting their education for one reason or another
sw3134B-ms98-a-0037 272.609000 276.935250 than what are we going to do with them what's going to happen to them are they going to be
sw3134B-ms98-a-0038 276.935250 287.801750 able to uh work at other kind of menial jobs or are they going to be the thieves and the people in prison and our prisons are filling up faster then we can build them that's no good
sw3134B-ms98-a-0039 287.801750 293.747750 [silence]
sw3134B-ms98-a-0040 293.747750 295.138250 uh-huh
sw3134B-ms98-a-0041 295.138250 316.855750 [silence]
sw3134B-ms98-a-0042 316.855750 318.316125 [laughter]
sw3134B-ms98-a-0043 318.316125 336.690875 [silence]
sw3134B-ms98-a-0044 336.690875 345.575625 well i think uh one thing that we'll see is that we won't be educating everybody there will be a lot of people who will not get even a menial education like in other countries of the world
sw3134B-ms98-a-0045 345.575625 351.765500 where they don't try to educate everyone that's one of the things that we do we try to educate everyone
sw3134B-ms98-a-0046 351.765500 354.276375 we're the only country in the world that does
sw3134B-ms98-a-0047 354.276375 363.821000 and let everyone have an opportunity to reach higher education if they're willing you know to work and have uh some ability they can do that
sw3134B-ms98-a-0048 363.821000 380.300500 [silence]
sw3134B-ms98-a-0049 380.300500 383.085500 but you know if we can keep them in school
sw3134B-ms98-a-0050 383.085500 384.416000 [silence]
sw3134B-ms98-a-0051 384.416000 390.207625 then that that helps a lot i think the gang violence is scaring everyone to death too
sw3134B-ms98-a-0052 390.207625 392.075750 it's scary to me
sw3134B-ms98-a-0053 392.075750 395.247625 [silence]
sw3134B-ms98-a-0054 395.247625 396.560750 i

sw3134B-ms98-a-0057 400.564250 422.337500 [silence]
sw3134B-ms98-a-0058 422.337500 427.180250 um i would imagine that we've talked the amount of time necessary
sw3134B-ms98-a-0059 427.180250 428.911500 okay
