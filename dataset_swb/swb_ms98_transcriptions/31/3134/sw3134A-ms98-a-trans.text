sw3134A-ms98-a-0012 48.870125 60.922875 right well just recently in the paper here were articles about students um working high school students that work and the percentage of hours that they work and how that affects their grades
sw3134A-ms98-a-0013 60.922875 66.531750 but then the follow-up the next day was i was kind of glad to see because it it said that 
sw3134A-ms98-a-0014 66.531750 76.310875 you know yes but for those students who are determined to do well anyway that you know handling a job was very possible
sw3134A-ms98-a-0015 76.310875 79.704750 you know and that it seemed to have more to do
sw3134A-ms98-a-0016 79.704750 80.888875 [silence]
sw3134A-ms98-a-0017 80.888875 82.959625 with other factors

sw3134A-ms98-a-0025 106.290250 115.577000 but there still can be an attitude of you know this is a stopgap measure because we need it right now but but that the most important thing is still
sw3134A-ms98-a-0026 115.577000 125.088500 you know getting your education well when they meant said the the topic you know of what's wrong with the public schools my my first im[pulse]- impulse was
sw3134A-ms98-a-0027 125.088500 130.902375 it isn't really what's wrong with the public public schools it's what's wrong with families

sw3134A-ms98-a-0045 172.427375 176.656750 you know at our school we have over a thousand elementary kids
sw3134A-ms98-a-0046 176.656750 181.361625 and last year was the first year that we ever had more than one counselor

sw3134A-ms98-a-0048 184.616500 197.828625 and i was talking to somebody that teaches in a middle school and they said oh but we need more in the middle school because that's when kids are you know at a tougher and rougher age and all that but you know part of my feeling is that if you solve
sw3134A-ms98-a-0049 197.828625 203.856500 help them to work through their problems while they're littler then they won't have as many problems up there
