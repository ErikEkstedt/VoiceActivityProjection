sw3107A-ms98-a-0002 5.163250 26.605000 [silence]
sw3107A-ms98-a-0003 26.605000 30.244375 that week right
sw3107A-ms98-a-0004 30.244375 45.920000 [silence]
sw3107A-ms98-a-0005 45.920000 48.120750 um
sw3107A-ms98-a-0006 48.120750 51.350250 [silence]
sw3107A-ms98-a-0007 51.350250 56.475500 well um i uh right now i'm into a weird situation i'm a graduate student and uh
sw3107A-ms98-a-0008 56.475500 59.356125 uh i don't have that many benefits per se [laughter]
sw3107A-ms98-a-0009 59.356125 60.590000 um
sw3107A-ms98-a-0010 60.590000 62.021875 sort of get
sw3107A-ms98-a-0011 62.021875 64.069750 [silence]
sw3107A-ms98-a-0012 64.069750 68.814875 yeah yeah my wife has a real job and i simply see from her angle um
sw3107A-ms98-a-0013 68.814875 71.865500 uh i think health insurance is real real important
sw3107A-ms98-a-0014 71.865500 77.232875 uh i've i've i've i've discovered i mean even in my case it's sort of they're really um
sw3107A-ms98-a-0015 77.232875 87.907750 a pain in the neck about it up here because the the university makes me buy a small they they have a mandatory they have what they call the mandatory portion of their health insurance
sw3107A-ms98-a-0016 87.907750 98.514125 they offer insurance to everyone but then the basics that are major medical [vocalized-noise] they they force you to buy here now i'm covered by my wife's anyway but i still pay them a hundred dollars a semester
sw3107A-ms98-a-0017 98.514125 105.728000 for uh mandatory so that's sort of annoying that i'm paying for something i'm not getting in that case i'd rather that that went to something else
sw3107A-ms98-a-0018 105.728000 110.724625 [silence]
sw3107A-ms98-a-0019 110.724625 118.508125 right i mean uh and and and it turns out that actually uh the benefits they you know that that hundred dollars
sw3107A-ms98-a-0020 118.508125 130.729375 sort of would would entitle me to go to the university health services here you know and and use them and it turns out that i do think they're v[ery]- they're excellent physicians there so through my wife's HMO we've registered for them as our primary care physicians
sw3107A-ms98-a-0021 130.729375 143.648875 so we go there anyway so they're they're so if they were to bill which which i believe they don't but if they were to bill the HMO for my business they could in in theory be getting paid twice for the same thing but they're not thank God um
sw3107A-ms98-a-0022 143.648875 154.366750 but anyway uh otherwise i i would imagine uh good vacation is is important although i don't know if that's really a deciding factor for many people on a job i don't you know
sw3107A-ms98-a-0023 154.366750 203.427500 [silence]
sw3107A-ms98-a-0024 203.427500 208.167625 oh wow [noise] so that's the real [noise]
sw3107A-ms98-a-0025 208.167625 215.100875 [silence]
sw3107A-ms98-a-0026 215.100875 224.905625 yeah i mean i don't you know i don't i know my wife uh i see she gets you know about two weeks a year i guess but they're pretty good about it if she wants other time off they [vocalized-noise] you know usually let her
sw3107A-ms98-a-0027 224.905625 230.709125 [silence]
sw3107A-ms98-a-0028 230.709125 232.257125 yeah

sw3107A-ms98-a-0034 261.446000 273.829750 [silence]
sw3107A-ms98-a-0035 273.829750 275.577125 that's oh that's a
sw3107A-ms98-a-0036 275.577125 277.428750 that's reasonable i think
sw3107A-ms98-a-0037 277.428750 309.375125 [silence]
sw3107A-ms98-a-0038 309.375125 311.141375 yeah

sw3107A-ms98-a-0040 317.830625 319.779125 weigh are see such of things
sw3107A-ms98-a-0041 319.779125 333.285000 yeah i think i was watching something the other day about that actually on uh a news special or something like that and they were saying how in some sense that that's good because that makes health care affordable for everyone and makes you know lowers the cost of everything and all insurance
sw3107A-ms98-a-0042 333.285000 341.986500 and in other cases it's actually bad because it winds up people you are talking to they have much less of a choice in who they can use and stuff like that so
sw3107A-ms98-a-0043 341.986500 363.483625 [silence]

sw3107A-ms98-a-0048 395.986250 399.066375 at least us who decides
sw3107A-ms98-a-0049 399.066375 422.427250 [silence]
