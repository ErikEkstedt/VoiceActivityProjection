sw3107B-ms98-a-0003 18.188375 32.007125 changes as uh as percep[tion]- my perception changes of of what uh i'm getting gypped on [laughter] this week or this month uh uh
sw3107B-ms98-a-0004 32.007125 46.812000 uh we're just uh going through uh uh well there's a couple of changes to the to the uh our health plan and uh and i guess right now the one in my mind is health insurance but uh
sw3107B-ms98-a-0005 46.812000 52.380875 if i step back i'm not sure i'd i'd uh say that what what about you
sw3107B-ms98-a-0006 52.380875 55.937500 [silence]
sw3107B-ms98-a-0007 55.937500 57.488125 oh okay
sw3107B-ms98-a-0008 57.488125 58.870500 [silence]
sw3107B-ms98-a-0009 58.870500 60.353500 [laughter-yes]
sw3107B-ms98-a-0010 60.353500 65.072625 okay but but on the other hand [vocalized-noise] one of these days you'll be out looking for a
sw3107B-ms98-a-0011 65.072625 71.725625 [silence]
sw3107B-ms98-a-0012 71.725625 72.881000 yeah
sw3107B-ms98-a-0013 72.881000 87.384500 [silence]
sw3107B-ms98-a-0014 87.384500 88.920125 yeah
sw3107B-ms98-a-0015 88.920125 95.136625 [silence]
sw3107B-ms98-a-0016 95.136625 97.076500 [vocalized-noise]
sw3107B-ms98-a-0017 97.076500 100.109000 right okay
sw3107B-ms98-a-0018 100.109000 104.959875 [silence]
sw3107B-ms98-a-0019 104.959875 111.708500 and and yeah and the benefits you're getting for that hundred dollars semester uh you you never use because you just use your wife's
sw3107B-ms98-a-0020 111.708500 139.981875 [silence]
sw3107B-ms98-a-0021 139.981875 141.830875 yeah
sw3107B-ms98-a-0022 141.830875 152.457875 [silence]
sw3107B-ms98-a-0023 152.457875 160.084750 uh yeah i it uh
sw3107B-ms98-a-0024 160.084750 174.887250 the th[at]- that i[s]- that's a a negative about uh where where i am in that uh well i came out of uh i worked five years civil service and there it's uh if i remember right you well if they
sw3107B-ms98-a-0025 174.887250 187.050375 they accumulate it as hours per week or something like that and or hours per pay period or something but anyway it works out as i remember basically to uh you start at at uh
sw3107B-ms98-a-0026 187.050375 198.393375 two and a half weeks or something like that and it at three years uh it goes to four weeks i believe and i i'm coming up on i've been at TI now uh uh
sw3107B-ms98-a-0027 198.393375 211.358625 coming up on fifteen years and it and it just uh this year is going to go to four weeks here so uh uh yeah that's a that that is a a a negative but uh
sw3107B-ms98-a-0028 211.358625 216.325625 but not probably not at probably not a deciding factor but uh
sw3107B-ms98-a-0029 216.325625 221.480000 [silence]
sw3107B-ms98-a-0030 221.480000 222.400250 yeah
sw3107B-ms98-a-0031 222.400250 223.813375 [silence]
sw3107B-ms98-a-0032 223.813375 234.483000 well that that yeah that's uh th[at]- that's the thing is how how flexible they are for comp time kinds of kinds of things and uh uh
sw3107B-ms98-a-0033 234.483000 248.001375 that's the the the uh yeah th[at]- that's uh why it hasn't made all that much difference is because the with the civil service that you could take you could take your vacation in increments of one hour
sw3107B-ms98-a-0034 248.001375 260.753625 and uh and but uh there wasn't uh anything as far as comp time so you tend to dribble away a week of it a year uh you know an hour here a couple hours there kind of a thing
sw3107B-ms98-a-0035 260.753625 268.106750 uh where as uh here i uh things are free enough to that uh
sw3107B-ms98-a-0036 268.106750 275.460000 the the actual vacation time per year probably isn't that isn't that much different but uh
sw3107B-ms98-a-0037 275.460000 287.203500 but the yeah i think the i think the health insurance i think that's that's going through changes everywhere to uh the they've uh uh
sw3107B-ms98-a-0038 287.203500 290.872250 gone through a couple years ago here where they
sw3107B-ms98-a-0039 290.872250 303.235375 uh will cover you much better if you go to their designated hospitals and now they're in the process of developing a list of of uh designated doctors uh so that
sw3107B-ms98-a-0040 303.235375 307.349000 just routine visits uh ah they will
sw3107B-ms98-a-0041 307.349000 320.845250 compensate much better for if you go to their designated doctors which which uh my assumption is that that will not include my doctor since uh he keeps real busy without having to to uh yeah
sw3107B-ms98-a-0042 320.845250 340.288750 [silence]
sw3107B-ms98-a-0043 340.288750 348.075000 well and and i think uh in the in the in the much bigger picture than uh
sw3107B-ms98-a-0044 348.075000 361.550875 to some extent hospitals and doctors have some uh fixed amount and if if you don't work for somebody that's got enough clout to to uh uh give you
sw3107B-ms98-a-0045 361.550875 374.823500 you know give you these rates and make this agreement then uh you're you're not covered by that and and the added costs get passed on to you so uh i'm not i'm not sure it my uh
sw3107B-ms98-a-0046 374.823500 386.242625 one of the phrases i use is that that it's moving towards uh private socialized medicine that uh in terms of the negatives of of of
sw3107B-ms98-a-0047 386.242625 397.837500 always heard in terms of socialized medicine you you have no choice on who you who you go to for a doctor and things like that uh where it's the government that decides here it's it's uh
sw3107B-ms98-a-0048 397.837500 410.908500 yeah uh and but it but it's the the same the effect is the same as the you you uh get left out of the loop more i i i know that their uh
sw3107B-ms98-a-0049 410.908500 425.163125 idea is that uh if if you have to pay a bigger share you'll you'll be more careful about spending the spending the money and and helping hold down the costs but uh uh i 
sw3107B-ms98-a-0050 425.163125 432.738000 i don't know in in terms in terms of uh the health care uh i uh find that that uh
sw3107B-ms98-a-0051 432.738000 444.039000 although i've i've been lucky enough to never have any big problems but that that uh the cost is not a a big factor i want to i want to know if the doctor's doing the right thing to make me get better
sw3107B-ms98-a-0052 444.039000 445.943625 [silence]
sw3107B-ms98-a-0053 445.943625 447.283125 yeah
sw3107B-ms98-a-0054 447.283125 449.822000 yeah and
