sw3105B-ms98-a-0003 4.615750 10.112625 well uh capital punishment's a hard thing but uh there've been several
sw3105B-ms98-a-0004 10.112625 17.786875 there've been several things that have happened where i felt like if i had been involved in it i would have had to
sw3105B-ms98-a-0005 17.786875 23.590625 to go along with with that being the punishment given to to the people
sw3105B-ms98-a-0006 23.590625 27.623625 there have been some things you know i mean there's things done that are just
sw3105B-ms98-a-0007 27.623625 29.926375 [silence]
sw3105B-ms98-a-0008 29.926375 32.362750 yeah that i i don't know how
sw3105B-ms98-a-0009 32.362750 35.440625 i don't really think there's any other way to deal with it
sw3105B-ms98-a-0010 35.440625 37.097750 [silence]
sw3105B-ms98-a-0011 37.097750 38.054375 [noise]
sw3105B-ms98-a-0012 38.054375 50.465250 [silence]
sw3105B-ms98-a-0013 50.465250 53.637375 yeah i think that that that that's a really
sw3105B-ms98-a-0014 53.637375 61.972500 [silence]
sw3105B-ms98-a-0015 61.972500 66.476250 yeah if it's a it's a it presents a clear and present danger i mean it 
sw3105B-ms98-a-0016 66.476250 73.165375 [noise] but it's something that's really hard to deal with the way that our justice system is right now
sw3105B-ms98-a-0017 73.165375 85.093625 is basically set up in lawyers and and anybody will tell you that uh it is set up right now all the laws protect the criminal they're the ones with the rights
sw3105B-ms98-a-0018 85.093625 92.265875 they have the right to uh you know i think i watched something last week um
sw3105B-ms98-a-0019 92.265875 99.613875 [vocalized-noise] that evict uh i'm sorry the accused has the right to a speedy trial
sw3105B-ms98-a-0020 99.613875 100.820500 [silence]
sw3105B-ms98-a-0021 100.820500 106.019375 but the victim does not have the right doesn't have the same
sw3105B-ms98-a-0022 106.019375 119.718875 doesn't have the same the same uh emphasis on those things as far as they're concerned so now the accused can can ask for delays and extensions and what do they call whatever they call them_1 you know
sw3105B-ms98-a-0023 119.718875 121.357250 [silence]
sw3105B-ms98-a-0024 121.357250 125.171625 e[xactly]- uh-huh uh-huh exactly a co[ntinuance]- continuance
sw3105B-ms98-a-0025 125.171625 133.223750 they can get continuances on for years before a a thing ever comes to trial and that makes the victim suffer more
sw3105B-ms98-a-0026 133.223750 134.098125 the [vocalized-noise]
sw3105B-ms98-a-0027 134.098125 140.941375 [silence]
sw3105B-ms98-a-0028 140.941375 142.405375 yeah that too
sw3105B-ms98-a-0029 142.405375 143.938000 um
sw3105B-ms98-a-0030 143.938000 150.569750 i think that uh you know that there needs to be a way that you know once someone
sw3105B-ms98-a-0031 150.569750 153.801875 has gone through
sw3105B-ms98-a-0032 153.801875 155.048000 [silence]
sw3105B-ms98-a-0033 155.048000 159.824625 you know a tri[al]- a trial i don't know how to fix it i mean it just seems like there
sw3105B-ms98-a-0034 159.824625 165.212875 there should be a limit on how many appeals can be made you know when someone has been
sw3105B-ms98-a-0035 165.212875 166.527625 [silence]
sw3105B-ms98-a-0036 166.527625 171.527875 ha[s]- uh yeah when someone ha[s]- well even when someone has been convicted
sw3105B-ms98-a-0037 171.527875 172.936250 and i mean
sw3105B-ms98-a-0038 172.936250 174.117125 [silence]
sw3105B-ms98-a-0039 174.117125 175.776625 it's just so
sw3105B-ms98-a-0040 175.776625 179.250250 so abundantly clear that they did it
sw3105B-ms98-a-0041 179.250250 180.341625 [silence]
sw3105B-ms98-a-0042 180.341625 187.095375 that appealing you know and continuing to appeal like four or five or six times
sw3105B-ms98-a-0043 187.095375 194.004875 to have convictions overturned and then they have to be retried and all that it's such a waste of time and energy and money
sw3105B-ms98-a-0044 194.004875 205.101500 and it just that's what keeps that's what's keeping all the the you know the the criminals in a position of being able to be released all the time like this
sw3105B-ms98-a-0045 205.101500 213.839125 [silence]
sw3105B-ms98-a-0046 213.839125 215.373875 oh
sw3105B-ms98-a-0047 215.373875 219.315125 [silence]
sw3105B-ms98-a-0048 219.315125 225.275500 well i guess there's extenuating circumstances to anything like that um
sw3105B-ms98-a-0049 225.275500 227.087750 [silence]
sw3105B-ms98-a-0050 227.087750 229.684250 you know like i c[ould]- i could see
sw3105B-ms98-a-0051 229.684250 244.383500 uh a first time offender being you know maybe [vocalized-noise] in in a in a robbery situation trying to hold up a a store and getting scared and you know firing a gun and accidently
sw3105B-ms98-a-0052 244.383500 256.791375 killing someone okay i could see that that might be a situation where uh the person could be rehabilitated but i think just out and out murder and i'm talking about uh
sw3105B-ms98-a-0053 256.791375 259.049000 cutting people up
sw3105B-ms98-a-0054 259.049000 269.072250 you know where there's shown to be pathological tendencies where this person has done it over and over again in a serial fashion or whatever
sw3105B-ms98-a-0055 269.072250 274.942500 that those kinds of things and any any kind of violent assault rape included
sw3105B-ms98-a-0056 274.942500 279.365625 needs to be addressed in in in that context
sw3105B-ms98-a-0057 279.365625 284.792750 [silence]
sw3105B-ms98-a-0058 284.792750 292.159625 well that bothers me that that bothers me a great deal i had a friend who was a police officer who was killed in the line of duty
sw3105B-ms98-a-0059 292.159625 296.604125 and the thing that was the worst about it is that these
sw3105B-ms98-a-0060 296.604125 303.031500 that uh two of these individuals were uh well all of the individuals involved were very young
sw3105B-ms98-a-0061 303.031500 316.735375 one was technically a minor and so he was sent back to Mexico he was an illegal alien the other two had lived here they had graduated from high school here and they had told their teachers that
sw3105B-ms98-a-0062 316.735375 326.641375 that i mean repeatedly uh during high school they had told their teachers that they were going to be that they were going to to graduate from high school and kill cops
sw3105B-ms98-a-0063 326.641375 337.044625 that was what they had told their teachers and so that's what they did and uh they were they were given i think oh absolutely
sw3105B-ms98-a-0064 337.044625 341.325625 he stopped them for a routine traffic violation and they
sw3105B-ms98-a-0065 341.325625 343.252875 uh
sw3105B-ms98-a-0066 343.252875 350.102500 [noise] several several things happened that night but they they beat him up and took his gun and shot him
sw3105B-ms98-a-0067 350.102500 353.110750 with it and it was
sw3105B-ms98-a-0068 353.110750 356.225375 it was really terrible i mean
sw3105B-ms98-a-0069 356.225375 359.732250 uh i'd seen him like three or four days before that 
sw3105B-ms98-a-0070 359.732250 361.837500 we'd we've gone out uh
sw3105B-ms98-a-0071 361.837500 364.092125 [silence]
sw3105B-ms98-a-0072 364.092125 368.309625 with with he and his wife and that was really really disturbing
sw3105B-ms98-a-0073 368.309625 381.383625 you know that that happened and that these people you know in the in the course of the trial you know came up with with all these you know things about well you know they were disadvantaged and all this stuff well nobody's that disadvantaged
sw3105B-ms98-a-0074 381.383625 383.427500 and there's just no rea[son]- i mean
sw3105B-ms98-a-0075 383.427500 385.468000 no
sw3105B-ms98-a-0076 385.468000 390.071375 [noise]
sw3105B-ms98-a-0077 390.071375 393.890625 yeah i think so too and that's uh
sw3105B-ms98-a-0078 393.890625 396.856125 so i i d[o]- i do feel strongly about
sw3105B-ms98-a-0079 396.856125 403.754125 [silence]
sw3105B-ms98-a-0080 403.754125 404.825750 yeah

sw3105B-ms98-a-0086 435.708000 441.742000 the thing that even though juries sometimes make the decisions and still the people nothing ever happens to them
sw3105B-ms98-a-0087 441.742000 443.171125 [silence]
sw3105B-ms98-a-0088 443.171125 450.716500 you know they stay in jail they get off time for good behavior and stuff and they get released and they go right back and do it again
