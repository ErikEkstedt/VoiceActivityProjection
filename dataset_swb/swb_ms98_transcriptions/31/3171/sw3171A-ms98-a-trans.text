sw3171A-ms98-a-0016 81.584625 92.416625 a project he's going to be and then i said well i'll go along i hope it's swimming season [laughter-because] [laughter-it] [laughter-wasn't] a tremendous thing not amount of things to do that i wanted to do there
sw3171A-ms98-a-0017 92.416625 97.298375 [silence]
sw3171A-ms98-a-0018 97.298375 104.220875 it well an[d]- and that's probably we do like the night life to an extent and they do have a Mardi Gras night planned
sw3171A-ms98-a-0019 104.220875 111.475250 and i'm kind of anxious for that but um yours to Disneyworld sounds [laughter] a little bit better
sw3171A-ms98-a-0020 111.475250 117.885375 did you know that next week there's several TV shows coming from there in celebration of their anniversary
sw3171A-ms98-a-0021 117.885375 122.550000 [silence]
sw3171A-ms98-a-0022 122.550000 129.767500 well and with a daughter nine it is just she's old enough to really grasp the meaning behind
sw3171A-ms98-a-0023 129.767500 136.657500 uh i[f]- so uh well if you're working then you're probably on a limited amount of time per year that you can go
sw3171A-ms98-a-0024 136.657500 144.279250 [silence]
sw3171A-ms98-a-0025 144.279250 145.677375 oh that's
sw3171A-ms98-a-0026 145.677375 147.948875 [silence]
sw3171A-ms98-a-0027 147.948875 156.848750 well i really i think travel when i heard my topic today i thought okay that's my favo[rite]- [laughter-that's] [laughter-my] [laughter-favorite] becau[se]-
sw3171A-ms98-a-0028 156.848750 164.088125 and really at our point of life our children are grown and um it has just worked out really well with this um
sw3171A-ms98-a-0029 164.088125 171.046000 position he's in because i can go at a spur of the moment or what have you and it depends where he's going
sw3171A-ms98-a-0030 171.046000 181.527625 whether or not i decide to go along but i do do like to travel and it's um i don't mind the pool life at all during the day and i like to sightseeing and i love to shop
sw3171A-ms98-a-0031 181.527625 183.493625 [laughter-so] [laughter-it's]
sw3171A-ms98-a-0032 183.493625 186.030125 [noise] that's right but if thi[s]-
sw3171A-ms98-a-0033 186.030125 187.175375 [silence]
sw3171A-ms98-a-0034 187.175375 199.847000 well and one of my very favorite is Las Vegas um that i would have to say we both end up going to Las Vegas um probably once every maybe year and a half
sw3171A-ms98-a-0035 199.847000 211.472625 and presently we have quite a few frequent flyer miles and so i've just requested that they send us two of our coach tickets because we have a lot of flying with Continental
sw3171A-ms98-a-0036 211.472625 220.292250 and they're recommending that you use those because they don't know the future of Continental and i said well now that we have all the miles we better [laughter-start] [laughter-using] [laughter-them] 
sw3171A-ms98-a-0037 220.292250 226.959250 uh so we are thinking that we might go to Las Vegas during the winter this year sometime for
sw3171A-ms98-a-0038 226.959250 239.459875 just kind of a quick trip um when we normally go that way we like to go to California at the same time because we really don't get out there as often as you could probably from Texas
sw3171A-ms98-a-0039 239.459875 255.555125 [silence]
sw3171A-ms98-a-0040 255.555125 265.351125 i think that's a good trip and really for the children to learn as well for a family vacation that would be excellent
sw3171A-ms98-a-0041 265.351125 272.730625 now we did what we sometimes do since we are in Ohio and it takes a while just to even get to the
sw3171A-ms98-a-0042 272.730625 286.351375 what i would call the more picturesque part of the country we will fly to something like once we flew to Colorado to Denver and then we rented a car for two weeks and we went through the northern route and through Utah
sw3171A-ms98-a-0043 286.351375 296.700000 and as far west as Las Vegas and then we returned through uh New Mexico that you just mentioned and it was oh it was just great
sw3171A-ms98-a-0044 296.700000 299.458000 oh i- i think that's that's the way to
