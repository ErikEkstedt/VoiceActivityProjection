sw3109A-ms98-a-0084 334.139875 342.214625 well i've never been in one so i but i'm always wondering how on earth somebody six seven [laughter-six] [laughter-eight] [laughter-getting] [laughter-into] [laughter-those] [laughter-little] [laughter-old] [laughter-things]
sw3109A-ms98-a-0085 342.214625 343.242000 [silence]

sw3109A-ms98-a-0089 357.285625 363.035375 well even to get out of it though i mean you're you're only a foot off the ground at the most
sw3109A-ms98-a-0090 363.035375 373.929250 and it's got to be you know you can't get your leg out and so i- i thought i always you always see them standing by it you know if they're advertising they don't ever show them getting in and out
sw3109A-ms98-a-0091 373.929250 377.021625 and i thought i that's the part i'd like to see [laughter] 
sw3109A-ms98-a-0092 377.021625 379.139250 [laughter-is] [laughter-them] [laughter-getting] in or out
sw3109A-ms98-a-0093 379.139250 380.504750 [silence]
sw3109A-ms98-a-0094 380.504750 388.434000 right well listen i never had a car that's had the swivel seats that where you can like when you're wanting to get out you just turn it to the side and then your feet are
sw3109A-ms98-a-0095 388.434000 395.236375 and and i don't even know if they i know for a while back i saw them advertise that and i thought that might be kind of a neat
sw3109A-ms98-a-0096 395.236375 396.377875 [silence]
sw3109A-ms98-a-0097 396.377875 402.209625 a neat thing to have but i- i for some reason they don't carry them and i don't know if they found they were unsafe or
sw3109A-ms98-a-0098 402.209625 406.495875 you know maybe to do that they had couldn't make them where they were just real stable
sw3109A-ms98-a-0099 406.495875 411.924250 one thing our d[oes]- our car doesn't have that i'd look for in another car is that that little
sw3109A-ms98-a-0100 411.924250 421.814375 gutter like it runs so that when you open the door the water doesn't [laughter-just] [laughter-come] [laughter-off] the it doesn't have that so when you open our car door it comes the new the new one does
sw3109A-ms98-a-0101 421.814375 434.157875 so they i guess that's [laughter] the year they learned that's not a good idea because it just comes right off the roof and straight down and just you know i try to put an umbrella up there but that doesn't help too much it just
sw3109A-ms98-a-0102 434.157875 438.380750 so i get the interior wet and i don't like to do that just along the side there
