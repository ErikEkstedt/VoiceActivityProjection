sw3189A-ms98-a-0003 14.390000 18.086125 and they're usually quite similar i think

sw3189A-ms98-a-0005 20.626250 25.891500 but um most of his people are from Oregon so we kind of met halfway
sw3189A-ms98-a-0006 25.891500 36.862625 and so this was one and they um planned it up in the mountains and got a cabin and and had you know things like that have to be planned like they had planned that

sw3189A-ms98-a-0008 50.428875 52.385625 [silence]
sw3189A-ms98-a-0009 52.385625 54.053125 um-hum

sw3189A-ms98-a-0011 56.928000 64.652750 oh i oh uh jeez i think over um three hundred were there it was quite a large
sw3189A-ms98-a-0012 64.652750 75.507625 it was a great big lodge and so we had plenty of room and everything and and some of them live in that area so it wasn't too hard for them to come in the day and leave but um
sw3189A-ms98-a-0013 75.507625 79.537500 that was a great big thing and we do that with his family about every
sw3189A-ms98-a-0014 79.537500 88.943750 five years a great big one and then like immediate family we do like uh we try to do one thing once a year
sw3189A-ms98-a-0015 88.943750 91.444375 [silence]
sw3189A-ms98-a-0016 91.444375 98.762750 well he has eight brothers and sisters so that's big by itself [laughter]
sw3189A-ms98-a-0017 98.762750 103.386500 yeah so we have a little shindig with them
sw3189A-ms98-a-0018 103.386500 109.332625 uh they're close in a close proximity um
sw3189A-ms98-a-0019 109.332625 115.352875 uh let's see there are four of them who live here in Texas and his mom and dad
sw3189A-ms98-a-0020 115.352875 125.599875 so um the others live in close neighboring um states like Nevada Arizona i think like that and
sw3189A-ms98-a-0021 125.599875 126.776125 [silence]
sw3189A-ms98-a-0022 126.776125 130.220500 yeah so it's been fun how about_1 you
sw3189A-ms98-a-0023 130.220500 145.085625 [silence]
sw3189A-ms98-a-0024 145.085625 146.681000 um-hum
sw3189A-ms98-a-0025 146.681000 156.092000 [silence]
sw3189A-ms98-a-0026 156.092000 159.320750 um-hum that's hard
sw3189A-ms98-a-0027 159.320750 162.473375 yeah yeah
sw3189A-ms98-a-0028 162.473375 170.614500 [silence]
sw3189A-ms98-a-0029 170.614500 172.109750 um-hum
sw3189A-ms98-a-0030 172.109750 185.315625 [silence]
sw3189A-ms98-a-0031 185.315625 187.042625 yeah
sw3189A-ms98-a-0032 187.042625 196.827875 [laughter] it really is fun and my mom's family does it once a year just like you said once a year um they have a a
sw3189A-ms98-a-0033 196.827875 205.444125 a Wednesday through a a Saturday type thing you can come and go as you please type thing and they do that once a year i kind of missed it
sw3189A-ms98-a-0034 205.444125 212.088250 this year and felt bad but you can't go every year you just cannot do that um
sw3189A-ms98-a-0035 212.088250 214.077250 [silence]
sw3189A-ms98-a-0036 214.077250 221.042375 um basically they just stay with each other brothers or sisters there are enough in the area to
sw3189A-ms98-a-0037 221.042375 229.945375 to just kind of span yourself out um whoever's mom and dad it is you usually go and stay with them like i go stay with my mother and
sw3189A-ms98-a-0038 229.945375 235.168875 my cousins they just go stay with their mom and dad you know kind of thing and so it's not hard
sw3189A-ms98-a-0039 235.168875 243.650000 in in that respect because they all are pretty centralized in one Utah area so that's not hard but
sw3189A-ms98-a-0040 243.650000 253.496250 the real planning that's the real key and they send out my mom's family now this is the first reunion with my husband's family i've really been involved with
sw3189A-ms98-a-0041 253.496250 262.443250 but my mom's family each brother and sister takes a turn one year and that's how they divide it up and then
sw3189A-ms98-a-0042 262.443250 264.364625 [silence]
sw3189A-ms98-a-0043 264.364625 275.949125 uh she has ten in that family and each one of them take their turn and then the the parent whose turn it is the child whose
sw3189A-ms98-a-0044 275.949125 288.396625 turn it is her children help her like if it was my mother's turn all of us children would help her put it on kind of thing yeah and um the thing is that um
sw3189A-ms98-a-0045 288.396625 299.458000 the the real part is there are two mailings that go out and the first one is to just kind of give a an approximate date and time so you can start getting
