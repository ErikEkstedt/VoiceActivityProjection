sw3125A-ms98-a-0044 196.688875 205.967250 well re[ally]- in reality uh they are my favorite team uh uh and have been you know back since the glory days or before the glory days
sw3125A-ms98-a-0045 205.967250 214.489500 they used to practice you know right over here uh on uh six thirty five and Coit right in that area
sw3125A-ms98-a-0046 214.489500 215.509750 [silence]
sw3125A-ms98-a-0047 215.509750 217.487750 yeah right uh-huh
sw3125A-ms98-a-0048 217.487750 232.481250 and uh it was a dingy little old field uh uh that uh y[ou]- you would have thought maybe a a high school would have played on and it's all surrounded you know by apartments and businesses and everything i was shocked when i saw it
sw3125A-ms98-a-0049 232.481250 236.993500 [silence]
sw3125A-ms98-a-0050 236.993500 245.485000 yeah and it had holes in it and it had big tire on it where the former coach you know uh stood up in there in there and
sw3125A-ms98-a-0051 245.485000 253.499000 but i guess uh you know it doesn't take a lot of uh fancy things to make a good football team
sw3125A-ms98-a-0052 253.499000 254.712625 [silence]
sw3125A-ms98-a-0053 254.712625 259.499250 since they did uh they were America's team you know back then
sw3125A-ms98-a-0054 259.499250 260.758125 [silence]
sw3125A-ms98-a-0055 260.758125 266.484500 and and i don't think they are now though looks like somebody else laid claim to that
sw3125A-ms98-a-0056 266.484500 267.998250 [silence]
sw3125A-ms98-a-0057 267.998250 279.536500 uh i've been to several games uh in my lifetime however i prefer to watch the uh watch the game uh via the TV tube
sw3125A-ms98-a-0058 279.536500 289.717625 yeah i i i find myself uh when i go to the football games of uh of uh missing a play by talking to somebody in the group
sw3125A-ms98-a-0059 289.717625 296.875375 or a st[ands]- a fan stands up or i'm looking at the cheerleaders or the clowns
sw3125A-ms98-a-0060 296.875375 311.449625 and when something does happen i say what happened you know and then course uh you can see it on the on the playback out there uh but back there when i was going i don't think it was that good
sw3125A-ms98-a-0061 311.449625 314.259750 or if they had it at all you know
sw3125A-ms98-a-0062 314.259750 319.490750 [silence]
sw3125A-ms98-a-0063 319.490750 321.172250 yeah uh-huh
sw3125A-ms98-a-0064 321.172250 322.202625 [silence]
sw3125A-ms98-a-0065 322.202625 327.017375 uh-huh we we have a lake house see and we go out of town
sw3125A-ms98-a-0066 327.017375 330.993750 and yeah we just go down there and uh watch the game
sw3125A-ms98-a-0067 330.993750 336.493750 [silence]
sw3125A-ms98-a-0068 336.493750 351.485000 yes absolutely and and uh if the team you know starts off good this year i think that uh they will be a a drawing card and perhaps they can uh uh return to their former glory days 
sw3125A-ms98-a-0069 351.485000 362.496375 you know i had people uh all over the world you know that i run into uh say you know they think of one thing the Dallas Cowboys and the movie Dallas
sw3125A-ms98-a-0070 362.496375 373.183250 and so uh i think that uh they will come back and Johnson while he's unorthodox i think he is doing a good job and he's all uh he's all business
sw3125A-ms98-a-0071 373.183250 383.459000 and he got a lot he got he got rid of a lot of the cry babies uh the people that thought that had it they had it made because uh they were stars
sw3125A-ms98-a-0072 383.459000 389.762250 and he cleaned that out real good and and i'm sure he lost some good ones that shouldn't have gone but
sw3125A-ms98-a-0073 389.762250 403.000000 in his type offense he was looking for youth and for uh uh uh to rebuild a new team and i think that was the reason why he cut all the players
sw3125A-ms98-a-0074 403.000000 411.494875 and i think also that oil man that uh that uh owns that oilman and his partners that own the team uh
sw3125A-ms98-a-0075 411.494875 422.227250 is interested in making a dollar and and they've certainly gone to uh great lengths to you know to bring the team back into Texas for spring training
sw3125A-ms98-a-0076 422.227250 432.837750 and and also to build up the team to try to satisfy the people and the various factions you know uh especially back in the beginning i think he's done a great job
sw3125A-ms98-a-0077 432.837750 433.989500 [silence]
sw3125A-ms98-a-0078 433.989500 435.997250 what's his name uh
sw3125A-ms98-a-0079 435.997250 437.992375 [silence]
sw3125A-ms98-a-0080 437.992375 439.999125 Jones yeah
sw3125A-ms98-a-0081 439.999125 449.746375 and uh he's an oilman and he's got a little money behind him and uh and uh so you know the they've got the stadium out there it's a
