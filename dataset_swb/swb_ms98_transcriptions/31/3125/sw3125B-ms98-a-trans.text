sw3125B-ms98-a-0003 7.717375 11.305500 [silence]
sw3125B-ms98-a-0004 11.305500 12.995000 oh you could
sw3125B-ms98-a-0005 12.995000 14.772375 [silence]
sw3125B-ms98-a-0006 14.772375 16.675000 okay
sw3125B-ms98-a-0007 16.675000 20.491250 [silence]
sw3125B-ms98-a-0008 20.491250 23.488875 the Bears right
sw3125B-ms98-a-0009 23.488875 28.281625 i'm not sure how they'll do this year i don't know who they'll use as quarterback
sw3125B-ms98-a-0010 28.281625 31.776875 i'm not sure they know who they'll use at quarterback yet
sw3125B-ms98-a-0011 31.776875 42.476125 [silence]
sw3125B-ms98-a-0012 42.476125 50.989625 well what uh i get optimistic about is just uh the relative age of the team now with all the youth that they've added
sw3125B-ms98-a-0013 50.989625 59.975500 and sort of a change in the nature of the team to the to more of the uh the the pure athlete type at all the positions
sw3125B-ms98-a-0014 59.975500 66.472500 um i like them having added a wide receiver with a nice track background that can high jump real high
sw3125B-ms98-a-0015 66.472500 67.492000 [silence]
sw3125B-ms98-a-0016 67.492000 78.231625 uh Alvin Harper i think out of Tennessee because he was a think he's about six foot three and apparently can catch anything that's anywhere near him and uh
sw3125B-ms98-a-0017 78.231625 81.713375 i understand that in high school he high jumped seven feet
sw3125B-ms98-a-0018 81.713375 86.989750 when he was in high school so uh he creates a real problem for people now
sw3125B-ms98-a-0019 86.989750 93.979750 uh particularly probably down in the end zone where Troy can go back there and put one up in the sky and let him go up and get it
sw3125B-ms98-a-0020 93.979750 104.955375 [silence]
sw3125B-ms98-a-0021 104.955375 110.708125 getting hurt i don't think this one has any a record like that he seems to be more of a
sw3125B-ms98-a-0022 110.708125 113.499500 a a sturdy athlete
sw3125B-ms98-a-0023 113.499500 117.774375 i know they have lost a lot of their receivers to injuries in the last few years
sw3125B-ms98-a-0024 117.774375 118.832375 [silence]
sw3125B-ms98-a-0025 118.832375 120.296625 yeah Jimmy
sw3125B-ms98-a-0026 120.296625 123.309875 [silence]
sw3125B-ms98-a-0027 123.309875 128.497000 well he did better last year than most people thought including including myself but uh
sw3125B-ms98-a-0028 128.497000 137.261000 [silence]
sw3125B-ms98-a-0029 137.261000 145.275875 well i guess you mean by that that he sort of brings a more of a college atmosphere to it than than certainly than his predecessor
sw3125B-ms98-a-0030 145.275875 152.980625 i really don't know how they they really react to that It probably does him well right now with with like i said the youth he has on the team
sw3125B-ms98-a-0031 152.980625 154.493250 um
sw3125B-ms98-a-0032 154.493250 160.494875 i think one thing he did this year that will probably pay some dividends is is changing the offensive
sw3125B-ms98-a-0033 160.494875 170.991625 coach that bring in a new uh offense and new offensive system that i think the so far the players are are uh re[sponding]- responding well to
sw3125B-ms98-a-0034 170.991625 173.972625 [silence]
sw3125B-ms98-a-0035 173.972625 175.770750 well that's the theory

sw3125B-ms98-a-0037 178.995000 183.496375 [silence]
sw3125B-ms98-a-0038 183.496375 188.291375 well i don't know whether anybody can for a whole year anymore
sw3125B-ms98-a-0039 188.291375 192.995875 but uh he is uh he's pretty sturdy but he's got to learn to get rid of it pretty quick
sw3125B-ms98-a-0040 192.995875 193.999500 [silence]
sw3125B-ms98-a-0041 193.999500 198.470625 uh well is Cowboys your your favorite team as well or

sw3125B-ms98-a-0050 230.995875 238.024375 i think that was the place that had the looked like corrugated tin fence around it painted blue

sw3125B-ms98-a-0056 258.249625 261.346500 yeah during that time period they sure were
sw3125B-ms98-a-0057 261.346500 263.004875 [silence]
sw3125B-ms98-a-0058 263.004875 265.495125 do you go to many of

sw3125B-ms98-a-0060 268.978500 277.986250 [silence]
sw3125B-ms98-a-0061 277.986250 280.999375 well i guess i do too really

sw3125B-ms98-a-0069 312.972375 319.997625 right that's right i think i went to more of their games when they were still operating out of uh the Cotton Bowl
sw3125B-ms98-a-0070 319.997625 322.700500 than i have since they moved to Texas Stadium
sw3125B-ms98-a-0071 322.700500 323.997500 course
sw3125B-ms98-a-0072 323.997500 326.262625 [silence]
sw3125B-ms98-a-0073 326.262625 328.495125 oh that works out nicely
sw3125B-ms98-a-0074 328.495125 330.481625 [silence]
sw3125B-ms98-a-0075 330.481625 337.960750 i'm hoping that they'll be successful and they'll have a lot more sellouts and fewer blackouts this year
sw3125B-ms98-a-0076 337.960750 350.450375 [silence]
