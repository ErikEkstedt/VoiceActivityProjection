sw3131B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.986875 [noise]
sw3131B-ms98-a-0002 0.986875 15.211125 we're to discuss a little bit about the process of putting someone in a nursing home and and making the decision on a family basis and probably the first question would be whether you've ever had to go through that process
sw3131B-ms98-a-0003 15.211125 31.251375 [silence]
sw3131B-ms98-a-0004 31.251375 33.010625 uh-huh
sw3131B-ms98-a-0005 33.010625 37.982875 [silence]
sw3131B-ms98-a-0006 37.982875 39.744250 uh-huh
sw3131B-ms98-a-0007 39.744250 42.497125 [silence]
sw3131B-ms98-a-0008 42.497125 46.495625 so it was pretty much a physical decision
sw3131B-ms98-a-0009 46.495625 56.248750 [silence]
sw3131B-ms98-a-0010 56.248750 57.720000 um
sw3131B-ms98-a-0011 57.720000 62.756750 [silence]
sw3131B-ms98-a-0012 62.756750 73.492625 yeah my husband's family are reaching that point but it's it's so difficult [vocalized-noise] was she in favor of it or or was she
sw3131B-ms98-a-0013 73.492625 75.751875 kind of opposed to it
sw3131B-ms98-a-0014 75.751875 83.782750 [silence]
sw3131B-ms98-a-0015 83.782750 85.281125 uh-huh
sw3131B-ms98-a-0016 85.281125 89.293875 [silence]
sw3131B-ms98-a-0017 89.293875 91.246875 yeah
sw3131B-ms98-a-0018 91.246875 99.706125 [silence]
sw3131B-ms98-a-0019 99.706125 107.454375 so often i think though elderly people don't realize that their diet is that bad i work with a lot of elderly people i'm a trust officer
sw3131B-ms98-a-0020 107.454375 115.778125 and so often they think they're adequately caring for themselves when they're really not eating very much or very balanced meals
sw3131B-ms98-a-0021 115.778125 117.978125 [silence]
sw3131B-ms98-a-0022 117.978125 126.495375 yes well you know that's part of the aging process that your taste buds goes back to the sweet taste it really is yeah uh-huh
sw3131B-ms98-a-0023 126.495375 127.512125 [silence]
sw3131B-ms98-a-0024 127.512125 128.997500 yeah
sw3131B-ms98-a-0025 128.997500 130.263125 [silence]
sw3131B-ms98-a-0026 130.263125 139.836875 and the portions people don't want to try to figure out little bitty individual meals i do that right now [laughter] and i'm not near nursing home age [laughter]
sw3131B-ms98-a-0027 139.836875 140.860000 [silence]
sw3131B-ms98-a-0028 140.860000 142.490375 yeah
sw3131B-ms98-a-0029 142.490375 145.273250 [silence]
sw3131B-ms98-a-0030 145.273250 146.988500 um-hum
sw3131B-ms98-a-0031 146.988500 149.975875 so as a family you all just
sw3131B-ms98-a-0032 149.975875 156.038500 visited nursing homes or probably in College Station there wasn't a whole lot of choice
sw3131B-ms98-a-0033 156.038500 166.970500 [silence]
sw3131B-ms98-a-0034 166.970500 168.751125 um-hum
sw3131B-ms98-a-0035 168.751125 177.465500 [silence]
sw3131B-ms98-a-0036 177.465500 179.188125 um-hum
sw3131B-ms98-a-0037 179.188125 187.512250 [silence]
sw3131B-ms98-a-0038 187.512250 188.999500 uh-huh
sw3131B-ms98-a-0039 188.999500 199.486375 [silence]
sw3131B-ms98-a-0040 199.486375 202.219250 oh yeah that's a given
sw3131B-ms98-a-0041 202.219250 206.347375 [silence]
sw3131B-ms98-a-0042 206.347375 211.485000 um-hum and sometimes the the help there does it i think
sw3131B-ms98-a-0043 211.485000 216.496750 [silence]
sw3131B-ms98-a-0044 216.496750 218.251875 um-hum
sw3131B-ms98-a-0045 218.251875 229.477375 [silence]
sw3131B-ms98-a-0046 229.477375 231.292875 um-hum
sw3131B-ms98-a-0047 231.292875 239.498250 [silence]
sw3131B-ms98-a-0048 239.498250 242.492875 adapt yeah
sw3131B-ms98-a-0049 242.492875 243.718125 [silence]
sw3131B-ms98-a-0050 243.718125 257.836000 i as i think i mentioned i was in the trust business and i've seen so many elderly people usually there has to be some wealth involved which is great if if you're financially if if you don't make the decisions so late that you're worried about money but
sw3131B-ms98-a-0051 257.836000 268.246625 the the places like Presbyterian Village and some of the the retirement places where where they have different levels of care seems to be so much better
sw3131B-ms98-a-0052 268.246625 276.697125 as far as elderly people adapting they're able to move in while they're still independent and still social and and they do group things
sw3131B-ms98-a-0053 276.697125 284.036125 and then as health or or mental capacity deteriorates they're able to take the next steps without so much change and
sw3131B-ms98-a-0054 284.036125 292.499750 oh i wish everybody could go that direction rather than just all of a sudden moving out of the home they've always been in it's really kind of difficult
sw3131B-ms98-a-0055 292.499750 302.269250 [silence]
sw3131B-ms98-a-0056 302.269250 304.220000 yeah
sw3131B-ms98-a-0057 304.220000 310.269000 [silence]
sw3131B-ms98-a-0058 310.269000 311.491875 uh-huh
sw3131B-ms98-a-0059 311.491875 314.246250 [silence]
sw3131B-ms98-a-0060 314.246250 320.833500 well and it's the first step in in actually accepting that you are failing and and aging
sw3131B-ms98-a-0061 320.833500 333.154375 you know once you make that step you know that it's just going to be downhill from then on and and i've seen people really fight it that desperately needed to make the change
sw3131B-ms98-a-0062 333.154375 343.918000 they they became in fact that's probably what's going to happen with my husband's mother she's going to endanger herself before she'll willingly and probably will never willingly make the decision
sw3131B-ms98-a-0063 343.918000 348.745250 and that scares me the the thought of forcing somebody to do something
sw3131B-ms98-a-0064 348.745250 349.776625 [silence]
sw3131B-ms98-a-0065 349.776625 350.989250 yeah
sw3131B-ms98-a-0066 350.989250 356.208625 [silence]
sw3131B-ms98-a-0067 356.208625 357.705750 uh-huh
sw3131B-ms98-a-0068 357.705750 358.805000 [silence]
sw3131B-ms98-a-0069 358.805000 360.995500 not as independence
sw3131B-ms98-a-0070 360.995500 364.996125 [laughter] yeah
sw3131B-ms98-a-0071 364.996125 368.704750 [silence]
sw3131B-ms98-a-0072 368.704750 371.483125 uh-huh uh-huh
sw3131B-ms98-a-0073 371.483125 375.987875 [silence]
sw3131B-ms98-a-0074 375.987875 379.807500 yeah and the quality of life really isn't there
sw3131B-ms98-a-0075 379.807500 382.704500 oh it's tough it really is
sw3131B-ms98-a-0076 382.704500 387.805750 [silence]
sw3131B-ms98-a-0077 387.805750 389.311250 uh-huh
sw3131B-ms98-a-0078 389.311250 390.375625 [silence]
sw3131B-ms98-a-0079 390.375625 397.616125 well they fear being dependent on somebody they they fear being a burden to to family members
sw3131B-ms98-a-0080 397.616125 403.211625 my husband's mother will have major surgery and we'll find out about it in a casual conversation
sw3131B-ms98-a-0081 403.211625 413.190875 she'll let something slip and we'll [laughter] say wait a minute and and that's it she just well i didn't want to bother you she can't accept that we want to be the care givers
sw3131B-ms98-a-0082 413.190875 418.998750 yeah well she stayed she stayed in a temporary nursing home until she was okay
sw3131B-ms98-a-0083 418.998750 430.470750 you know it's just but it's frightening to us because we live pretty far from her she's down in Temple and we can't see her often enough to really know what's going on
sw3131B-ms98-a-0084 430.470750 436.958125 so it's difficult it really is and we're all heading that way and
sw3131B-ms98-a-0085 436.958125 441.730125 [silence]
sw3131B-ms98-a-0086 441.730125 443.476750 uh-huh
sw3131B-ms98-a-0087 443.476750 449.489750 [silence]
sw3131B-ms98-a-0088 449.489750 450.548875 yeah
