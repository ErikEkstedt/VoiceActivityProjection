sw3131A-ms98-a-0002 14.468500 25.821875 well not so much personally but my um husband has a aunt who has been like a second mother i mean always lived in the same town and took care of him and such 
sw3131A-ms98-a-0003 25.821875 38.629125 they live down in College Station where his parents do too and they put her in a home last year she appeared to have a couple of light strokes and started to uh not be able to be in her apartment on her own
sw3131A-ms98-a-0004 38.629125 43.456625 so they found a a place nearby that they put her in last year
sw3131A-ms98-a-0005 43.456625 46.474000 [silence]
sw3131A-ms98-a-0006 46.474000 57.128125 uh yeah although she is uh in pretty good health and she's doesn't take any medication it's just she had had her own apartment and drove a car and everything up until that point
sw3131A-ms98-a-0007 57.128125 64.030000 then she was starting to get uh you know lose memory sometimes and which is kind of frightening when she's in the car

sw3131A-ms98-a-0009 65.527125 72.755375 [silence]
sw3131A-ms98-a-0010 72.755375 84.749125 well yeah when it finally came down to it um she just got to the point after the i mean it wasn't a very um strong stroke it was just kind of all of a sudden she wasn't quite herself anymore 
sw3131A-ms98-a-0011 84.749125 97.387750 and she got kind of fearful of being on her own she never really ate very well it was one thing she hardly ever took care of herself and she didn't eat she ate very poor so i think she was you know bad uh nutrition on top of it 
sw3131A-ms98-a-0012 97.387750 101.226000 and uh she got to the point she didn't want to alone anymore so

sw3131A-ms98-a-0025 138.276250 146.708625 although they've got uh Meals On Wheels which i understand is a really good you know way to handle that so that at least they eat
sw3131A-ms98-a-0026 146.708625 155.242375 [silence]
sw3131A-ms98-a-0027 155.242375 167.706500 no i don't think there was um i know a little bit more from a a coworker her mother-in-law had been in for quite some time and had different degrees of a place that she was in
sw3131A-ms98-a-0028 167.706500 182.017875 um she was ambulatory and so there was a lesser care uh then she got uh uh hip broken and then uh she wasn't as ambulatory so they were almost you know to the point of saying she can't be here anymore but
sw3131A-ms98-a-0029 182.017875 188.454625 i remember from her checking around she ended up staying at the Arkansas House i think out in Arlington something like that
sw3131A-ms98-a-0030 188.454625 200.258500 and uh you know the type of facilities whether it's a shared room or two separate rooms that share uh a uh bathroom all of them all seem to say that people there are going to steal their items
sw3131A-ms98-a-0031 200.258500 202.400000 they [laughter]
sw3131A-ms98-a-0032 202.400000 210.249500 they're always saying that somebody's going to and some of them i think unconsciously do it you know as a just you know half seni[le]-
sw3131A-ms98-a-0033 210.249500 211.764375 hum
sw3131A-ms98-a-0034 211.764375 223.194000 so they they uh don't have too many facilities it seems for their personal items very limited space waste but um at least they all seem to have some
sw3131A-ms98-a-0035 223.194000 235.341875 you know people that monitor their uh medication intake and dining facilities you know go to the dining room and and eat some good meals i know when my friend's mother-in-law first went in i mean
sw3131A-ms98-a-0036 235.341875 240.500000 very antisocial maybe it takes a while for them to say okay well i'll be with other people but
