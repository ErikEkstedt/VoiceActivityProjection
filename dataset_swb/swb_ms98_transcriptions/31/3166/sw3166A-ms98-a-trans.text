sw3166A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 2.324375 [noise] okay what kind of fishing do you do
sw3166A-ms98-a-0002 2.324375 9.955875 [silence]
sw3166A-ms98-a-0003 9.955875 11.345250 uh-huh
sw3166A-ms98-a-0004 11.345250 13.305875 [silence]
sw3166A-ms98-a-0005 13.305875 16.840625 that's one of the few things i've ever fished for is rainbow trout
sw3166A-ms98-a-0006 16.840625 18.460000 [silence]
sw3166A-ms98-a-0007 18.460000 21.091500 what what kind of bait do you use to catch them_1
sw3166A-ms98-a-0008 21.091500 24.922500 [silence]
sw3166A-ms98-a-0009 24.922500 26.741250 oh really fish eggs
sw3166A-ms98-a-0010 26.741250 28.697750 oh i didn't know that huh
sw3166A-ms98-a-0011 28.697750 30.288375 uh-huh
sw3166A-ms98-a-0012 30.288375 36.766875 [silence]
sw3166A-ms98-a-0013 36.766875 39.612250 oh i didn't know that's a great way
sw3166A-ms98-a-0014 39.612250 42.971250 i think that would probably be a good way to catch catfish also
sw3166A-ms98-a-0015 42.971250 44.427000 [silence]
sw3166A-ms98-a-0016 44.427000 51.317375 oh look catfish uh personally i like to catch large mouth bass and catfish because they fight the best
sw3166A-ms98-a-0017 51.317375 61.433625 but a [laughter-ca[tfish]-] a catfish will really just tear into anything like that like liver or uh cheese or anything that smells terrible [laughter]
sw3166A-ms98-a-0018 61.433625 63.500125 [silence]
sw3166A-ms98-a-0019 63.500125 70.861875 um no actually i always used to go to my grandparents' in Oklahoma and they have the uh Lake Texoma right next to them_1
sw3166A-ms98-a-0020 70.861875 79.948750 so the we used to catch some uh sand bass off Lake let's s[ee]- there's a Roosevelt Bridge and what we'd do is let the line all the way to the bottom
sw3166A-ms98-a-0021 79.948750 88.862000 and crank up you know turns on the reel about six to twelve times and the fish would be sitting at different levels
sw3166A-ms98-a-0022 88.862000 99.414500 so yeah you just leave it at that level and in no time something would hit it and you could pull them_1 up two and three times in a row but you had to find out what level how many cranks they were off the bottom
sw3166A-ms98-a-0023 99.414500 104.276875 and if you left it on the bottom there was a good chance that you'd catch catfish
sw3166A-ms98-a-0024 104.276875 110.951375 [noise] and of course depending on how big your bait was um you know would be depending on what you caught
sw3166A-ms98-a-0025 110.951375 112.332875 [silence]
sw3166A-ms98-a-0026 112.332875 117.361375 yeah that was a lot of fun my grandfather used to do that and we used to have a light at the top of the water
sw3166A-ms98-a-0027 117.361375 120.019375 he really [spoilt/spoiled] me in that respect
sw3166A-ms98-a-0028 120.019375 132.569250 [silence]
sw3166A-ms98-a-0029 132.569250 133.865750 um-hum
sw3166A-ms98-a-0030 133.865750 135.718000 [silence]
sw3166A-ms98-a-0031 135.718000 137.189875 uh-huh
sw3166A-ms98-a-0032 137.189875 141.217875 yeah well if you do you have any friends with ponds
sw3166A-ms98-a-0033 141.217875 142.284125 [silence]
sw3166A-ms98-a-0034 142.284125 152.540750 i um well if you can fi[nd]- well oh even a lake if uh seems like every time somebody's on the bank all they wanna do is throw it out just as far as they can
sw3166A-ms98-a-0035 152.540750 161.908375 and uh bring it in to you but it's the opposite when you're fishing from a boat you you wanna le[t]- make it land right on the shore and then drag like a plastic worm
sw3166A-ms98-a-0036 161.908375 176.346000 and just have it come into the water like a a regular animal or or fish uh well you know something coming off from the bank like they usually do so you don't have to really get uh fish from a boat you know because they're actually right there at the shore
sw3166A-ms98-a-0037 176.346000 184.118500 but i didn't used to be sold on plastic worms but uh if i am [laughter-now] [laughter-oh] [laughter-yeah]
sw3166A-ms98-a-0038 184.118500 192.010125 yeah it just uh just a slow reel and then let it sit on the bottom but the key is to always have your line tight
sw3166A-ms98-a-0039 192.010125 196.770875 and that way you can feel when they're hitting it and believe me you'll know the difference
sw3166A-ms98-a-0040 196.770875 199.495375 [silence]
sw3166A-ms98-a-0041 199.495375 209.450000 oh crappie actually [laughter-yeah] [noise] i've been fishing in the the ocean we're about three hours from the ocean and i also like Spanish mackerel
sw3166A-ms98-a-0042 209.450000 216.225250 and you can catch blues and uh that's a different kind of fishing off the pier too have you ever fished off the pier
sw3166A-ms98-a-0043 216.225250 224.778250 [silence]
sw3166A-ms98-a-0044 224.778250 226.133500 uh-huh
sw3166A-ms98-a-0045 226.133500 227.173625 [silence]
sw3166A-ms98-a-0046 227.173625 231.511750 oh the best thing for crappie is those little spinner baits
sw3166A-ms98-a-0047 231.511750 239.741375 and and jigs um they have like yellow um fuzz on a hook you know that kind of comes out
sw3166A-ms98-a-0048 239.741375 241.129125 yeah
sw3166A-ms98-a-0049 241.129125 243.885250 [silence]
sw3166A-ms98-a-0050 243.885250 253.388625 yeah get but they're a little heavier and they're bigger get the yellow ones those are the ticket [laughter] and let them_1 drop to the bottom
sw3166A-ms98-a-0051 253.388625 266.820500 and maybe do a a kind of a slow reel you don't even have to have a good rod or anything just just even a regular line and you throw it out and uh the the other thing that's real good is small um
sw3166A-ms98-a-0052 266.820500 276.747375 it's a real small repala it's about an inch and a half long and they're pure sil[ver]- all silver something real shiny about that long
sw3166A-ms98-a-0053 276.747375 282.066875 they'll go after that in a heartbeat also just anything that really shines or spins
sw3166A-ms98-a-0054 282.066875 289.454375 [silence]
sw3166A-ms98-a-0055 289.454375 292.396750 oh yeah yeah that's it
sw3166A-ms98-a-0056 292.396750 294.522125 [silence]
sw3166A-ms98-a-0057 294.522125 297.603750 oh really that's neat
sw3166A-ms98-a-0058 297.603750 298.690000 oh
