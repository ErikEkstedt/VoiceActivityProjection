sw3140B-ms98-a-0024 55.772875 61.748625 [silence]
sw3140B-ms98-a-0025 61.748625 65.272625 that involves a lot of different areas i think
sw3140B-ms98-a-0026 65.272625 72.481500 [silence]
sw3140B-ms98-a-0027 72.481500 77.451750 yeah there is a a big difference in the uh economic
sw3140B-ms98-a-0028 77.451750 85.971750 um status of uh people although i think that has been true uh always um
sw3140B-ms98-a-0029 85.971750 87.294250 [silence]
sw3140B-ms98-a-0030 87.294250 91.994875 perhaps there's less of the middle range then there was
sw3140B-ms98-a-0031 91.994875 104.998000 [silence]
sw3140B-ms98-a-0032 104.998000 106.781250 um
sw3140B-ms98-a-0033 106.781250 108.246625 [silence]
sw3140B-ms98-a-0034 108.246625 110.494000 i think uh
sw3140B-ms98-a-0035 110.494000 121.953250 m[y]- in my situation i have three children and we're uh home schooling so education you know things that relate t[o]- to education um
sw3140B-ms98-a-0036 121.953250 122.960625 [silence]
sw3140B-ms98-a-0037 122.960625 130.992250 are things that i think about a lot um i think that and i think that involves
sw3140B-ms98-a-0038 130.992250 133.376375 social changes a lot
sw3140B-ms98-a-0039 133.376375 135.851500 uh for instance
sw3140B-ms98-a-0040 135.851500 143.561750 i think the schools are having more and more problems because of uh things that
sw3140B-ms98-a-0041 143.561750 153.802625 are happening socially in the world around them and in in t[o]- because of their parents and things that are being taught in the home are not taught in the home rather
sw3140B-ms98-a-0042 153.802625 166.831375 more not than are and children being put in day care centers from very early and and i think that a lot of these things that have been happening such as the
sw3140B-ms98-a-0043 166.831375 172.994250 day care centers and things are having a big effect on the social changes
sw3140B-ms98-a-0044 172.994250 182.975750 because of the way children are being raised they're not learning the values they need to learn and they're not um
sw3140B-ms98-a-0045 182.975750 196.470750 they don't have the self-esteem that they need to have and they don't have the um a solid family life that they need to have to [vocalized-noise] confidently and 
sw3140B-ms98-a-0046 196.470750 199.986125 deal with the things in the world
sw3140B-ms98-a-0047 199.986125 203.977500 and uh i think we're seeing a lot of
sw3140B-ms98-a-0048 203.977500 209.518000 rebellion and things because of that and the things like the gang
sw3140B-ms98-a-0049 209.518000 210.791125 [silence]
sw3140B-ms98-a-0050 210.791125 214.487250 gang things that are happening and and um
sw3140B-ms98-a-0051 214.487250 225.775625 [silence]
sw3140B-ms98-a-0052 225.775625 227.482750 yeah
sw3140B-ms98-a-0053 227.482750 230.499125 [silence]
sw3140B-ms98-a-0054 230.499125 232.764125 yeah oh
sw3140B-ms98-a-0055 232.764125 246.736625 that's really sad i think that a lot of people and they think they have to but i i think that if they really tried they wouldn't have to and i i think that if they didn't that
sw3140B-ms98-a-0056 246.736625 251.195250 a[nd]- and it became more of the standard not to
sw3140B-ms98-a-0057 251.195250 264.463125 that uh i don't know maybe companies would start paying men more so that their wives could stay home you know and have a more solid uh foundation for the kids
sw3140B-ms98-a-0058 264.463125 265.986500 yeah
sw3140B-ms98-a-0059 265.986500 273.992625 [silence]
sw3140B-ms98-a-0060 273.992625 275.989750 that's right
sw3140B-ms98-a-0061 275.989750 278.277375 it's already
sw3140B-ms98-a-0062 278.277375 292.692750 it already costs society much more because of it you know it trying to do all these programs like Headstart and things like those you wouldn't have to do that if mothers would stay home with their children and do things with them you know
sw3140B-ms98-a-0063 292.692750 307.203000 um there's and i think uh a lot of it is selfishness people have become very selfish they don't want to stay home with the kids or something like that there are a lot of two parent
sw3140B-ms98-a-0064 307.203000 308.675000 um
sw3140B-ms98-a-0065 308.675000 309.769375 [silence]
sw3140B-ms98-a-0066 309.769375 315.737250 situations where the woman goes back to work because that's what she wants to do you know
sw3140B-ms98-a-0067 315.737250 328.495500 rather than that she has to have the money particularly or maybe there's a small need for money so she does it partly because of the money but partly for herself too
sw3140B-ms98-a-0068 328.495500 329.523000 [silence]
sw3140B-ms98-a-0069 329.523000 330.494625 you know
sw3140B-ms98-a-0070 330.494625 333.273750 [silence]
sw3140B-ms98-a-0071 333.273750 335.201000 home school
sw3140B-ms98-a-0072 335.201000 336.491500 yeah
sw3140B-ms98-a-0073 336.491500 339.991750 [silence]
sw3140B-ms98-a-0074 339.991750 348.981375 no we're i have uh one going into fourth grade and one starting kindergarten and then a preschooler and one on the way
sw3140B-ms98-a-0075 348.981375 352.499250 [laughter]
sw3140B-ms98-a-0076 352.499250 361.956625 yes yes and i think uh it's becoming uh more popular then it has been for a while i think
sw3140B-ms98-a-0077 361.956625 374.695500 home schooling's always been around but uh i can see more and more families going to it because of the problems in the schools um and a lot of it is discipline problems
sw3140B-ms98-a-0078 374.695500 382.715500 a lot of it is and you can tell which kids have been in day care centers it it's really obvious
sw3140B-ms98-a-0079 382.715500 387.983875 to look at them and watch the way they act and things that um
sw3140B-ms98-a-0080 387.983875 390.964750 they've been raised in a day care center
sw3140B-ms98-a-0081 390.964750 400.001500 [silence]
sw3140B-ms98-a-0082 400.001500 409.499500 well i think it's going to have to change in the homes before anything changes anywhere else the home is the base
sw3140B-ms98-a-0083 409.499500 412.232250 it's the basic unit
sw3140B-ms98-a-0084 412.232250 424.490500 and that's the where it all starts and if we don't start making changes in the homes and maybe part of that is educating parents better
sw3140B-ms98-a-0085 424.490500 428.257250 and educating uh you know
sw3140B-ms98-a-0086 428.257250 430.164625 [silence]
sw3140B-ms98-a-0087 430.164625 441.707125 i know they do do some they do have some classes in um high schools and things for kids to uh give them an idea of what
sw3140B-ms98-a-0088 441.707125 442.752750 [silence]
sw3140B-ms98-a-0089 442.752750 446.751000 family life is like and the uh you know
sw3140B-ms98-a-0090 446.751000 449.671875 and uh that kind of thing but um
