sw3110B-ms98-a-0101 330.943625 333.457875 for that kind of casual because_1
sw3110B-ms98-a-0102 333.457875 335.975125 we do go on a [noise] um
sw3110B-ms98-a-0103 335.975125 341.074250 i go back to Illinois and visit my folks for a week and then we go out to the east coast to visit my husband's
sw3110B-ms98-a-0104 341.074250 346.182625 mom and family and we usually go to the beach while we're out there so
sw3110B-ms98-a-0105 346.182625 350.961375 uh in fact i was thinking this summer that since i'm doing summer school i haven't
sw3110B-ms98-a-0106 350.961375 357.757000 worn har[dly]- very many of those things but i was thinking oh well i got to get them_1 all together so
sw3110B-ms98-a-0107 357.757000 359.511875 to take them_1 on our trip

sw3110B-ms98-a-0112 370.377625 372.418875 i took some stuff out
sw3110B-ms98-a-0113 372.418875 379.458500 and put it in another closet in the guest bedroom because i'm so tired of looking over it and it's all just a little bit too tight [laughter]
sw3110B-ms98-a-0114 379.458500 392.718250 [laughter] but it isn't so much too tight i mean i could easily well maybe not too easily but i could lose that weight and then they would all fit fine and you know and there are things that i really don't want to get rid of you know i really want
sw3110B-ms98-a-0115 392.718250 399.504625 to keep them because they're nice and so i thought well i'll put them_1 in there and then maybe i'll feel so bad that i can't wear them now
sw3110B-ms98-a-0116 399.504625 401.954125 and i'll do something [laughter-about] [laughter-it]
sw3110B-ms98-a-0117 401.954125 403.746250 but so far

sw3110B-ms98-a-0135 459.474500 463.570875 it's just unreal the time though that it really gets the worst is
sw3110B-ms98-a-0136 463.570875 466.087375 um is when the kids get
sw3110B-ms98-a-0137 466.087375 469.732500 old enough that they really care what they're wearing
sw3110B-ms98-a-0138 469.732500 472.694750 my kids are twelve and fifteen
sw3110B-ms98-a-0139 472.694750 478.429500 and um you know they're both boys so they're probably not as picky as if [laughter-they] [laughter-were] [laughter-girls] but
sw3110B-ms98-a-0140 478.429500 482.573750 on the other hand [laughter] they can be pretty picky and you know
sw3110B-ms98-a-0141 482.573750 484.536500 i mean i could get away with
sw3110B-ms98-a-0142 484.536500 486.413000 you know with
sw3110B-ms98-a-0143 486.413000 490.813500 it not costing nearly as much you know when they were littler because
sw3110B-ms98-a-0144 490.813500 492.581875 they didn't care [laughter]
sw3110B-ms98-a-0145 492.581875 497.137875 anything was fine but you know now it has to be a certain kind of
sw3110B-ms98-a-0146 497.137875 501.061000 certain kind of jeans and the the shoes are just about the worst
sw3110B-ms98-a-0147 501.061000 502.158875 uh
sw3110B-ms98-a-0148 502.158875 507.426250 gee um my son just came out the other day and he's his

sw3110B-ms98-a-0154 522.621500 527.694500 i mean they are absolutely demolished there are pieces hanging off of them
sw3110B-ms98-a-0155 527.694500 534.669625 the inside of the sole on the bottom has fallen out i mean that's how worn out they are
sw3110B-ms98-a-0156 534.669625 543.315750 and they c[ost]- i bought them on a wonderful sale at Mervyn's they must have been thirty five or so percent off they cost sixty dollars
