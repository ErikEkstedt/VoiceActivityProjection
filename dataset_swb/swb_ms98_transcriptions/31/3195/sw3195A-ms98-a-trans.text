sw3195A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 5.147000 [noise] uh what i[s]- what is your practice as far as budgeting do you manage the money
sw3195A-ms98-a-0002 5.147000 15.412000 [silence]
sw3195A-ms98-a-0003 15.412000 29.211500 oh i see that's how kind i am too are you married you are i think the women for the most part end up managing the money my husband always says he earns it and i have to spend only what he earns it
sw3195A-ms98-a-0004 29.211500 35.741000 [silence]
sw3195A-ms98-a-0005 35.741000 45.526500 well i don't work outside of the home and he always threatens that when i spend more than what's coming in i have to go back to work so i- i [laughter-manage]
sw3195A-ms98-a-0006 45.526500 50.562375 [silence]
sw3195A-ms98-a-0007 50.562375 53.525375 no do you actually follow a budget [noise]
sw3195A-ms98-a-0008 53.525375 85.928875 [silence]
sw3195A-ms98-a-0009 85.928875 94.438875 well that's pretty much the way we do um or we did in the past i would say what right at this point our children are grown
sw3195A-ms98-a-0010 94.438875 100.037750 and so i really don't have the obligations there anymore that we have to balance to 
sw3195A-ms98-a-0011 100.037750 102.677750 [laughter-you] [laughter-know] get things together for them
sw3195A-ms98-a-0012 102.677750 108.648125 and i really just keep very good records and most of our expenses
sw3195A-ms98-a-0013 108.648125 118.846500 are fairly the same every month with the exception of utilities and things like that and i try to keep my MasterCards and things paid currently
sw3195A-ms98-a-0014 118.846500 127.211375 uh i don't always succeed at that i usually keep one with a low interest rate and i'd put things on there that i think i'm not [laughter-gonna] [laughter-give] [laughter-to]
sw3195A-ms98-a-0015 127.211375 139.238625 and then i have another one but for the most part our mortgage and our utilities at this point we're in a new home and uh they take a pretty big chunk compared to what they used to
sw3195A-ms98-a-0016 139.238625 149.167250 so i'm still getting used to that but we make sure that we just do not buy unless we really can see how we're going to pay for it ahead
sw3195A-ms98-a-0017 149.167250 154.101375 and we do not buy use[d]- ah new cars uh do you get into the car
sw3195A-ms98-a-0018 154.101375 179.763875 [silence]
sw3195A-ms98-a-0019 179.763875 183.526250 we do for us very much so in fact we
sw3195A-ms98-a-0020 183.526250 189.678875 are in a position that most of our friends why wonder why we just don't go to a new car you know whatever and i said
sw3195A-ms98-a-0021 189.678875 196.003375 look you guys are all into car payments we haven't had car payments for so many years i love it this way
sw3195A-ms98-a-0022 196.003375 204.112125 and recently we just created the laugh among everyone because we had a car that we really liked
sw3195A-ms98-a-0023 204.112125 211.640875 and it has eighty two thousand miles on it and we were kept saying boy wouldn't it be great if we could find another one just like it
sw3195A-ms98-a-0024 211.640875 217.209250 believe it or not we did we found one one newer the worst part is it's the same color
sw3195A-ms98-a-0025 217.209250 226.213125 and so everybody's saying you're kidding you have two cars the [laughter-same] and i said you know how when you have a bad one you say never again [laughter]
sw3195A-ms98-a-0026 226.213125 233.633375 i said well we had one and we found one with just seventeen thousand miles on it and it's an eighty five
sw3195A-ms98-a-0027 233.633375 242.078750 and so i said hey this was a cinch we've paid for the car and we still know now that we have this car to put all the miles on
sw3195A-ms98-a-0028 242.078750 253.540875 this is for all the long running back and forth on you know interstate driving and things and we intend to replace our other one with a much newer car in the next couple of years [vocalized-noise] or next year probably
sw3195A-ms98-a-0029 253.540875 255.883000 [silence]
sw3195A-ms98-a-0030 255.883000 265.216000 generally from dealers and uh it depends because i don't like to sell what we're trading in to an individual
sw3195A-ms98-a-0031 265.216000 273.559375 uh unless we we have done that when we had a really good one that we wanted to sell you know uh we were going up to a larger one
sw3195A-ms98-a-0032 273.559375 284.491500 but we have found that by trading in and going through a dealer and we always make a deal i mean we have walked out of more dealerships saying
sw3195A-ms98-a-0033 284.491500 290.504625 don't bring us the manager and all of that unless you wanna bring him right away you're gonna get one shot at us
sw3195A-ms98-a-0034 290.504625 292.575750 we will [laughter-you] [laughter-know]
sw3195A-ms98-a-0035 292.575750 299.522000 and they say well you're kidding you know i no this is the price we're going to give you out the door we don't wanna hear about taxes
