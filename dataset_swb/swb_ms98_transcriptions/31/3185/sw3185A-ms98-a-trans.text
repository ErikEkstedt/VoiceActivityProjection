sw3185A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 3.516625 [noise] okay how's the weather been in Plano [laughter]
sw3185A-ms98-a-0002 3.516625 5.066250 [silence]
sw3185A-ms98-a-0003 5.066250 10.105375 r[ight]- [laughter] yeah this is probably unusual topic to give two of us in the same city
sw3185A-ms98-a-0004 10.105375 15.328125 uh well i don't know about you but i was really enjoying the cool snap last couple of weeks
sw3185A-ms98-a-0005 15.328125 17.995375 and i'm ready for it to come back
sw3185A-ms98-a-0006 17.995375 24.420125 well not the rain so much as the cool the other mornings when it was like sixty five when we woke up and sixty six
sw3185A-ms98-a-0007 24.420125 29.867375 and today and i when i got up the the temperature said more like of course seventy nine or eighty
sw3185A-ms98-a-0008 29.867375 32.515625 so i'm kind of ready for the pumpkin weather
sw3185A-ms98-a-0009 32.515625 34.116500 [silence]
sw3185A-ms98-a-0010 34.116500 36.562875 you don't are you a summer person
sw3185A-ms98-a-0011 36.562875 38.011125 are you [noise]
sw3185A-ms98-a-0012 38.011125 49.271375 well i have a friend who's the same way and anything below sixty she's just not happy but i- i think what i would miss is the change of seasons and all because i know in Plano we really don't have as many seasons as the
sw3185A-ms98-a-0013 49.271375 52.668125 my husband's from Nebraska and they have more of the four seasons
sw3185A-ms98-a-0014 52.668125 53.810000 [silence]
sw3185A-ms98-a-0015 53.810000 56.210125 oh you're used to that too
sw3185A-ms98-a-0016 56.210125 66.872000 you don't like the cold well i usually like it about sweater weather and the problem here in Plano is it doesn't last very long it goes from hot and then you get a couple of weeks of that Indian Summer and then it's cold
sw3185A-ms98-a-0017 66.872000 69.435875 and i wish it were several months of that
sw3185A-ms98-a-0018 69.435875 72.493125 [silence]
sw3185A-ms98-a-0019 72.493125 83.491000 [noise] well i don't either unless it's like uh some of our favorite's like a Friday night when it rains and you really didn't have anywhere to go and it's sleeping time but if you have to get up and get out in it [laughter-i] [laughter-don't] [laughter-like] [laughter-it] [laughter-either]
sw3185A-ms98-a-0020 83.491000 84.898625 [noise] no
sw3185A-ms98-a-0021 84.898625 86.182500 [silence]
sw3185A-ms98-a-0022 86.182500 88.180000 oh yeah
sw3185A-ms98-a-0023 88.180000 91.081250 [silence]
sw3185A-ms98-a-0024 91.081250 95.298625 well sure it does that kind of schedule you really need a lot more sunshine
sw3185A-ms98-a-0025 95.298625 99.356375 and also the evenings are going to be getting uh darker sooner
sw3185A-ms98-a-0026 99.356375 101.475875 because as it gets cooler
sw3185A-ms98-a-0027 101.475875 108.306750 but i did a walk last night and it seemed like it was a little bit hot still sometimes when you work up a sweat you need it to be a little bit cooler
sw3185A-ms98-a-0028 108.306750 111.704125 [silence]
sw3185A-ms98-a-0029 111.704125 120.693375 [noise] well i agree absolutely and you know it's all relative because i was from west Texas and it was very dry and so i thought Dallas was awful
sw3185A-ms98-a-0030 120.693375 126.301625 and i still think so but then this summer we went to Orlando for a week and it was so humid there
sw3185A-ms98-a-0031 126.301625 139.526500 that your um all your windows were [vocalized-noise] were wet every morning they had to get the squeegees and clean them off and when we got back to Dallas it seemed really [laughter-dry] because_1 it's kind of like what you're used to but i agree with you the humidity especially for curly heads like me
sw3185A-ms98-a-0032 139.526500 142.832625 yes i do not like the [laughter-humidi[ty]-]
sw3185A-ms98-a-0033 142.832625 144.348375 [noise]
sw3185A-ms98-a-0034 144.348375 150.439750 [silence]
sw3185A-ms98-a-0035 150.439750 151.866500 um-hum
sw3185A-ms98-a-0036 151.866500 163.974625 [silence]
sw3185A-ms98-a-0037 163.974625 177.001375 yeah i think so too i know our grass needs mowing twice as often [laughter-when] it [laughter-rains] but it seems like here i would like it to rain and then be over and then not rain for a while it seems like when it gets stuck in a rain pattern that's all it does
sw3185A-ms98-a-0038 177.001375 185.802500 so uh but i- i am ready for a little bit of the cooler weather and not so much in the nineties but something like i guess my my best would be probably
sw3185A-ms98-a-0039 185.802500 190.724000 sixty eight when you wake up or sixty six and then probably seventy five during the day
sw3185A-ms98-a-0040 190.724000 196.913250 yeah yeah are you do you like the heat in the summer then when it gets up in the nineties and hundreds
sw3185A-ms98-a-0041 196.913250 198.709125 yeah so
sw3185A-ms98-a-0042 198.709125 201.212125 yeah just keep it there [laughter]
sw3185A-ms98-a-0043 201.212125 204.008750 [silence]
sw3185A-ms98-a-0044 204.008750 205.329000 yeah
sw3185A-ms98-a-0045 205.329000 211.766125 well i do too i do too and that was one thing about the year around school that originally we had been sort of
sw3185A-ms98-a-0046 211.766125 220.306250 negative on it but then we started thinking especially in Plano the weather is so hot in August that there really isn't a lot the children can do outside anyhow [noise]
sw3185A-ms98-a-0047 220.306250 223.029375 [noise] static here
sw3185A-ms98-a-0048 223.029375 232.049875 [silence]
sw3185A-ms98-a-0049 232.049875 233.398250 yeah
sw3185A-ms98-a-0050 233.398250 237.025875 we do too i think a lot of people agree the same
sw3185A-ms98-a-0051 237.025875 238.746625 [silence]
sw3185A-ms98-a-0052 238.746625 241.426750 [noise] uh-huh uh-huh
sw3185A-ms98-a-0053 241.426750 244.837750 [silence]
sw3185A-ms98-a-0054 244.837750 253.260875 uh-huh now there have been worse summers in fact this morning when they were talking about uh Harold Taft they were talking about how this has been one of the milder
sw3185A-ms98-a-0055 253.260875 254.651250 of the summers
sw3185A-ms98-a-0056 254.651250 262.141000 and milder fall everybody seems to be you can tell some of the newscasters when they like the heat because_1 they'll talk about it being so gorgeous on those days when we're just
sw3185A-ms98-a-0057 262.141000 269.902875 [laughter-melting] and then you can tell when they talk about beautiful weather some mornings and we'll it'll be too cold and they'll say well those are the ones that like the cold weather
sw3185A-ms98-a-0058 269.902875 274.246375 [silence]
sw3185A-ms98-a-0059 274.246375 280.283250 oh yeah he did he did it was it was really a shame he didn't go with all the gimmicks that some of them_1 did
sw3185A-ms98-a-0060 280.283250 283.593750 [silence]
sw3185A-ms98-a-0061 283.593750 287.574375 it's kind of hard to keep on about the weather for five [laughter-minutes]
sw3185A-ms98-a-0062 287.574375 288.626500 [silence]
sw3185A-ms98-a-0063 288.626500 291.124000 oh is that right okay
sw3185A-ms98-a-0064 291.124000 292.163750 [silence]
