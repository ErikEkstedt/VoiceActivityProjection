sw3112A-ms98-a-0018 169.240375 178.344000 regrets i have is that i grew up with a house filled with classical music and music that i really loved but i never took the time to
sw3112A-ms98-a-0019 178.344000 186.807750 find out um who the composers were or it it was just always there and there were certain things that um

sw3112A-ms98-a-0021 199.460875 208.656875 and when my father lived with us um i made more of an effort to learn but um that's something that i
