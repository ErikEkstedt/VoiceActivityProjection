sw3112B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.416000 [noise]
sw3112B-ms98-a-0002 0.416000 1.948875 [silence]
sw3112B-ms98-a-0003 1.948875 6.776750 well Nancy [laughter] uh a[s]- as i was talking
sw3112B-ms98-a-0004 6.776750 19.292250 my brother uh his name is Ainsley and he was a conductor in New York City of a Goldman band and they did park concerts at the Lincoln Center
sw3112B-ms98-a-0005 19.292250 33.606625 uh during the summer season uh they were free concerts but he was with that group for like twenty one years and uh did both very traditional marches a lot of you know John Phillips Sousa and
sw3112B-ms98-a-0006 33.606625 39.475750 uh all of and Franco Goldman in fact the name of the uh the band was because
sw3112B-ms98-a-0007 39.475750 49.258375 one of the famous uh march composers of all time uh Richard Franco Goldman and his son Edwin actually i may may have those reversed father and son
sw3112B-ms98-a-0008 49.258375 56.988625 started the band like seventy years ago i think so it's the oldest organization really of it's type in the country
sw3112B-ms98-a-0009 56.988625 65.374750 and uh my brother became involved with them over twenty years ago as a manager and then ended up being both manager and conductor for quite a number of years
sw3112B-ms98-a-0010 65.374750 66.704000 so
sw3112B-ms98-a-0011 66.704000 69.493500 [silence]
sw3112B-ms98-a-0012 69.493500 81.950125 well i was able to uh to hear him about three years ago for the first time at a a concert there [noise] and uh it was quite enjoyable um
sw3112B-ms98-a-0013 81.950125 90.626000 in that uh he also had one of the c[omposers]- well actually there were two of the composers that he used were actually there at the performance also
sw3112B-ms98-a-0014 90.626000 97.607000 so i got to meet them and in particular i got to go to the rehearsal before hand
sw3112B-ms98-a-0015 97.607000 106.638750 and that was when i realized how good he really was was at a rehearsal as opposed to an actually performance of uh working with the musicians
sw3112B-ms98-a-0016 106.638750 113.027000 a[nd]- and one of his biggest struggles uh with the band was that this was all union musicians
sw3112B-ms98-a-0017 113.027000 117.479125 which didn't give him a lot of leeway once they were in the band
sw3112B-ms98-a-0018 117.479125 124.638500 uh he had a very difficult time replacing them no matter how they were performing at that particular season
sw3112B-ms98-a-0019 124.638500 132.763500 and uh he ended up with some very unusual characters in that that organization it was easy to tell that just from the rehearsal time
sw3112B-ms98-a-0020 132.763500 136.642375 but uh anyway what were you going to tell me about your dad
sw3112B-ms98-a-0021 136.642375 195.613125 [silence]
sw3112B-ms98-a-0022 195.613125 196.723375 oh
sw3112B-ms98-a-0023 196.723375 209.891250 [silence]
sw3112B-ms98-a-0024 209.891250 210.942250 uh-huh
sw3112B-ms98-a-0025 210.942250 218.190750 [silence]
sw3112B-ms98-a-0026 218.190750 219.006500 uh-huh
sw3112B-ms98-a-0027 219.006500 222.953750 [silence]
sw3112B-ms98-a-0028 222.953750 227.920500 oh yeah i- i was in the band in high school and that
sw3112B-ms98-a-0029 227.920500 229.510250 i played the clarinet
sw3112B-ms98-a-0030 229.510250 230.527250 [silence]
sw3112B-ms98-a-0031 230.527250 241.901250 and uh [noise] so i- i did that my all through high school and then i guess my first year in college i played but it wasn't a marching band it was just a it was a symphonic band
sw3112B-ms98-a-0032 241.901250 249.050000 and uh ironically in college the marching band was part of the athletic department rather than the music department
sw3112B-ms98-a-0033 249.050000 255.480625 [laughter] and i was i was in the symphonic band that was actually [laughter-part] [laughter-of] [laughter-the] [laughter-music] department and i thought that was pretty unusual
sw3112B-ms98-a-0034 255.480625 256.496625 oh
sw3112B-ms98-a-0035 256.496625 278.209500 [silence]
sw3112B-ms98-a-0036 278.209500 279.597625 right
sw3112B-ms98-a-0037 279.597625 286.446875 [silence]
sw3112B-ms98-a-0038 286.446875 287.422500 uh-huh
sw3112B-ms98-a-0039 287.422500 289.372500 [silence]
sw3112B-ms98-a-0040 289.372500 291.017625 a tu[ba]- tuba
sw3112B-ms98-a-0041 291.017625 296.084625 [silence]
sw3112B-ms98-a-0042 296.084625 298.499000 [laughter]
sw3112B-ms98-a-0043 298.499000 300.083625 [silence]
sw3112B-ms98-a-0044 300.083625 303.707000 right well does he bring the tuba home t[o]-
sw3112B-ms98-a-0045 303.707000 305.319250 oh my goodness
sw3112B-ms98-a-0046 305.319250 317.841500 [silence]
sw3112B-ms98-a-0047 317.841500 319.933375 [laughter]
sw3112B-ms98-a-0048 319.933375 324.753750 [silence]
sw3112B-ms98-a-0049 324.753750 329.358625 yeah just anything i have a niece that plays the harp
sw3112B-ms98-a-0050 329.358625 340.976125 and she found the same thing that uh she had i think what they call a troubadour harp for a while and that she learned on and trained on but then uh
sw3112B-ms98-a-0051 340.976125 354.393750 uh a harp became available which there just not very many instruments uh and a used harp became available in Colorado and they lived in in uh Missouri at the time 
sw3112B-ms98-a-0052 354.393750 360.758875 and they actually drove to Colorado to buy this instrument but they first had to go and buy a full sized
sw3112B-ms98-a-0053 360.758875 362.606375 station wagon
sw3112B-ms98-a-0054 362.606375 365.410500 uh so they'd have room to bring it home
sw3112B-ms98-a-0055 365.410500 372.446375 and that's dictated their cars every since then just having one large enough for a full you know concert harp
sw3112B-ms98-a-0056 372.446375 374.220625 that she [laughter-plays]
sw3112B-ms98-a-0057 374.220625 375.627500 uh
sw3112B-ms98-a-0058 375.627500 382.302625 well i uh because of my brother's uh work with music for a long time he was a
sw3112B-ms98-a-0059 382.302625 385.038250 uh a critic for the Music Journal
sw3112B-ms98-a-0060 385.038250 387.669500 and as a result of that he
sw3112B-ms98-a-0061 387.669500 398.437625 well that was part of the reason he ended up with this incredible classical album uh library or collection which i have now inherited
sw3112B-ms98-a-0062 398.437625 400.872125 and um
sw3112B-ms98-a-0063 400.872125 408.299125 i- i don't listen to in nearly enough it's the same sort of thing there's so much music that i recognize but don't who is yeah who is the composer
sw3112B-ms98-a-0064 408.299125 409.725500 but i've
sw3112B-ms98-a-0065 409.725500 423.450375 based on just measuring number of inches or in this case feet of albums that i think i have about a a uh two thousand album classical record collection now
sw3112B-ms98-a-0066 423.450375 430.034375 so i figured that uh i could probably listen to a different album every day of the year for about seven years [laughter]
sw3112B-ms98-a-0067 430.034375 432.797250 [laughter-if] i wanted [laughter-to] at this point
sw3112B-ms98-a-0068 432.797250 435.918375 but then it's hard to find a place to stack that much music
sw3112B-ms98-a-0069 435.918375 440.178500 most of it is still in boxes stacked quite high in a back room
sw3112B-ms98-a-0070 440.178500 441.966125 but uh
sw3112B-ms98-a-0071 441.966125 443.941500 anyway
sw3112B-ms98-a-0072 443.941500 445.442750 um
sw3112B-ms98-a-0073 445.442750 447.942875 [silence]
sw3112B-ms98-a-0074 447.942875 456.900750 well he really did uh i know that he was a critic probably in the early sixties in New York City he had um
sw3112B-ms98-a-0075 456.900750 467.569875 we were thirteen and a half years apart i think and he left home at like sixteen to go to Westminster Choir College
sw3112B-ms98-a-0076 467.569875 475.468125 and you know he did not finish high school he just went str[aight]- straight to Westminster so i never really remember having lived at home with him
sw3112B-ms98-a-0077 475.468125 480.203625 and after he did get out of college it was not long he
sw3112B-ms98-a-0078 480.203625 489.654250 before he uh just moved to New York City knowing that that's where he had to live to quote unquote make it in the music world
sw3112B-ms98-a-0079 489.654250 497.466625 and um became a music critic and that probably puts us somewhere around the early sixties uh when he was doing that
sw3112B-ms98-a-0080 497.466625 505.224875 i've seen that date a good bit on the uh on some of the albums because_1 he would typically uh sign and date everything that
sw3112B-ms98-a-0081 505.224875 514.178875 i think everything that he owned he did [laughter-that] [laughter-with] but certainly all of his albums and all of the music uh he had signed and dated
sw3112B-ms98-a-0082 514.178875 521.978375 [silence]
sw3112B-ms98-a-0083 521.978375 523.319000 my goodness
sw3112B-ms98-a-0084 523.319000 526.786750 [silence]
sw3112B-ms98-a-0085 526.786750 529.033125 you have one that's nineteen years older
sw3112B-ms98-a-0086 529.033125 530.497875 my goodness
sw3112B-ms98-a-0087 530.497875 532.911375 that is a wide spread
sw3112B-ms98-a-0088 532.911375 536.927875 well we were at the opposite ends there were two sisters in between
sw3112B-ms98-a-0089 536.927875 546.404750 but uh because he left home so early i think there was one summer i can remember him living at home and i was maybe six years old
sw3112B-ms98-a-0090 546.404750 552.570250 i mean other than that uh i don't even ever remember living in in the same house with him at all
sw3112B-ms98-a-0091 552.570250 559.316250 [silence]
sw3112B-ms98-a-0092 559.316250 562.090625 well it was it was thrilling
sw3112B-ms98-a-0093 562.090625 572.029750 um my mother was with me at the time and it was ironically it was the first time that we'd seen him conduct that particular group which he'd been with so long
sw3112B-ms98-a-0094 572.029750 577.338375 she had seen him fact she had seen him conduct in Carnegie Hall before
sw3112B-ms98-a-0095 577.338375 584.086750 um and i'm not sure it was probably the American Symphony Orchestra when Leopold Stokowlski was
sw3112B-ms98-a-0096 584.086750 595.145875 uh in New York City that was Stokowlski's orchestra and Ainsley was an associate conductor with him for quite a while [noise] and it at one point did in fact uh
sw3112B-ms98-a-0097 595.145875 596.173250 [silence]
sw3112B-ms98-a-0098 596.173250 600.246000 uh conduct there at Carnegie Hall so she got to see him there and i- i didn't
