sw3133A-ms98-a-0002 1.810375 7.117250 um well i guess first of all i i could have asked that before do you have children
sw3133A-ms98-a-0003 7.117250 17.471125 no okay because_1 i i didn't know if that would make a difference in how you felt um wh[at]- what do you think about the proposal that all young Americans should spend a year or two
sw3133A-ms98-a-0004 17.471125 27.039750 [silence]
sw3133A-ms98-a-0005 27.039750 28.263125 yeah
sw3133A-ms98-a-0006 28.263125 34.711750 [silence]
sw3133A-ms98-a-0007 34.711750 36.879125 i just um
sw3133A-ms98-a-0008 36.879125 39.338125 i guess that's [vocalized-noise] my
sw3133A-ms98-a-0009 39.338125 43.362250 that's something that my family has always believed strongly in and um
sw3133A-ms98-a-0010 43.362250 46.595875 i had opportunities in high school
sw3133A-ms98-a-0011 46.595875 49.240500 to work in some programs um
sw3133A-ms98-a-0012 49.240500 53.035875 and and i agree with what you said that it's
sw3133A-ms98-a-0013 53.035875 59.610250 uh it benefits the person doing it so much i don't think they realize and i uh
sw3133A-ms98-a-0014 59.610250 61.341000 [noise]
sw3133A-ms98-a-0015 61.341000 73.672125 i i think it gives you a better perspective on life and uh it gives you a little bit uh more a glimpse of the the real world and and it would certainly help the country too uh
sw3133A-ms98-a-0016 73.672125 81.088875 [silence]
sw3133A-ms98-a-0017 81.088875 82.321250 yeah
sw3133A-ms98-a-0018 82.321250 85.139125 [silence]
sw3133A-ms98-a-0019 85.139125 86.512500 yes
sw3133A-ms98-a-0020 86.512500 91.618500 [silence]
sw3133A-ms98-a-0021 91.618500 96.307750 yeah well i think sometimes through groups and organizations um
sw3133A-ms98-a-0022 96.307750 105.448000 my first when i first thought of it i thought it uh when they asked the question i thought well that sounds wonderful and then i wondered if people were unwilling but
sw3133A-ms98-a-0023 105.448000 111.779375 but i think even if you went in with a negative attitude i don't think it would stay negative very long um
sw3133A-ms98-a-0024 111.779375 116.788875 but i do know through some organized groups like Scouts and church um
sw3133A-ms98-a-0025 116.788875 119.722875 they do still have opportunities
sw3133A-ms98-a-0026 119.722875 120.840000 [silence]
sw3133A-ms98-a-0027 120.840000 124.386750 but i i think that's a small uh
sw3133A-ms98-a-0028 124.386750 126.240875 number
sw3133A-ms98-a-0029 126.240875 127.780000 that could
sw3133A-ms98-a-0030 127.780000 132.524250 [silence]
sw3133A-ms98-a-0031 132.524250 136.377125 no um not since um
sw3133A-ms98-a-0032 136.377125 137.545250 [silence]
sw3133A-ms98-a-0033 137.545250 141.258500 not as much as i remember growing up and that was something
sw3133A-ms98-a-0034 141.258500 142.682750 uh
sw3133A-ms98-a-0035 142.682750 143.691500 [silence]
sw3133A-ms98-a-0036 143.691500 149.688250 i think in the fifties and sixties um seemed more common in the last two decades
sw3133A-ms98-a-0037 149.688250 151.047250 [silence]
sw3133A-ms98-a-0038 151.047250 152.203500 but
sw3133A-ms98-a-0039 152.203500 155.730125 [silence]
sw3133A-ms98-a-0040 155.730125 157.199500 yes
sw3133A-ms98-a-0041 157.199500 161.857500 yeah where uh where abouts do you live what part of the country
sw3133A-ms98-a-0042 161.857500 171.360500 oh okay we're in Plano so we're not far apart one of the calls i'd gotten before was uh down to Austin and and i know
sw3133A-ms98-a-0043 171.360500 178.140125 a friend of mine talked to someone in the midwest so i know there is the possibility that it could be out of the area
sw3133A-ms98-a-0044 178.140125 184.492375 [silence]
sw3133A-ms98-a-0045 184.492375 185.916125 oh
sw3133A-ms98-a-0046 185.916125 200.335000 [silence]
sw3133A-ms98-a-0047 200.335000 201.543750 yeah
sw3133A-ms98-a-0048 201.543750 205.964375 [silence]
sw3133A-ms98-a-0049 205.964375 217.794375 well and maybe um maybe this would be a way to get that feeling back um if we've lost some of that and it it seems in the last decade or two um
sw3133A-ms98-a-0050 217.794375 220.920125 that's true maybe that's a way
sw3133A-ms98-a-0051 220.920125 225.150750 if if young people had to do it um
sw3133A-ms98-a-0052 225.150750 229.712500 maybe that would start the trend back because that's one of the things i always
sw3133A-ms98-a-0053 229.712500 233.303500 thought was a wonderful part of our country um
sw3133A-ms98-a-0054 233.303500 234.464500 [silence]
sw3133A-ms98-a-0055 234.464500 236.293875 is helping others
sw3133A-ms98-a-0056 236.293875 246.758375 [silence]
sw3133A-ms98-a-0057 246.758375 248.021375 yeah
sw3133A-ms98-a-0058 248.021375 258.653625 [silence]
sw3133A-ms98-a-0059 258.653625 260.570125 yeah i think uh
sw3133A-ms98-a-0060 260.570125 261.729500 [silence]
sw3133A-ms98-a-0061 261.729500 271.191750 i think it does help um even preschoolers you know they're um things even just starting around the home you know little ones can do a little bit to help the family
sw3133A-ms98-a-0062 271.191750 280.794875 and and just watching the parents do things too um it can start a pattern there's always something [noise] no matter how young and then that helps
sw3133A-ms98-a-0063 280.794875 293.786625 develop that attitude um i guess i would really like to see this happen with families more you know i think this is certainly a possible way um to handle it but
sw3133A-ms98-a-0064 293.786625 303.739875 i wish ah that's something that i think that has been lost in families and i think that's a good place to start again
sw3133A-ms98-a-0065 303.739875 307.552000 [silence]
sw3133A-ms98-a-0066 307.552000 309.544250 yeah
sw3133A-ms98-a-0067 309.544250 315.837000 and i do think um the schools do try and do something even with food drives and um
sw3133A-ms98-a-0068 315.837000 328.555625 sometimes what Richardson and Plano both i mean when you live in areas like that where there's so much they don't realize what a small percentage of the world that is i mean that's uh
sw3133A-ms98-a-0069 328.555625 335.627875 gosh i'm sure not even one percent of the world is as fortunate as these areas and uh
sw3133A-ms98-a-0070 335.627875 336.669625 [silence]
sw3133A-ms98-a-0071 336.669625 347.559875 it's i know our church youth group um starts with projects young but th[ey]- they have a high school group that works in the Appalachia area every year they've done this for fourteen years now
sw3133A-ms98-a-0072 347.559875 350.420625 um and it is it's um
sw3133A-ms98-a-0073 350.420625 351.903250 [silence]
sw3133A-ms98-a-0074 351.903250 365.318375 and they've also see that there's there's a different way of life and those families are really close some of the things that we talked about that were common in the fifties are still there and um
sw3133A-ms98-a-0075 365.318375 372.407875 it really every youth that's ever gone really has felt that their life has been changed and it's changed their perspective and
sw3133A-ms98-a-0076 372.407875 379.879250 and that's just the t[wo]- two weeks during during the summer so if two weeks um could have that kind of effect i would
sw3133A-ms98-a-0077 379.879250 381.536000 think uh
sw3133A-ms98-a-0078 381.536000 386.037375 [silence]
sw3133A-ms98-a-0079 386.037375 387.410375 well that's
