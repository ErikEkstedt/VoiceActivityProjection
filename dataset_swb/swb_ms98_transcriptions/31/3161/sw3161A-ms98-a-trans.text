sw3161A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.578000 [noise] the AIDS issue is
sw3161A-ms98-a-0002 1.578000 10.676375 is a bit of a problem i guess the first thing that comes to my mind not having any immediate friends with that problem is is the financial end i mean how
sw3161A-ms98-a-0003 10.676375 17.201000 can a country stand to uh spend as much or much more than they already are
sw3161A-ms98-a-0004 17.201000 30.861000 on such a problem uh but then that kind of thinking is also tempered with the the knowledge or at least the the rumor i'm not really sure if it's true or not that uh we're not spending
sw3161A-ms98-a-0005 30.861000 44.419500 as much per let's say afflicted person on cancer uh there's some uh take breast cancer for instance it seems to be doing much more damage and affecting much more peo[ple]- mean more people than AIDS
sw3161A-ms98-a-0006 44.419500 52.678875 and yet uh more people die of it and yet the funding is already uh exceeded AIDS has more money than uh breast cancer [noise]
sw3161A-ms98-a-0007 52.678875 59.748625 so uh i mean if it's true i i've i've always heard these things i've never bothered to dig it out and make sure but uh
sw3161A-ms98-a-0008 59.748625 64.331750 i've heard it on more than one documentary that uh they were complaining that
sw3161A-ms98-a-0009 64.331750 70.438125 whoever's sitting up there making these decisions uh or whatever institutions raise the money and uh
sw3161A-ms98-a-0010 70.438125 76.484125 it's just one big PR campaign that yeah we think that's the world's worst thing so let's give money to AIDS
sw3161A-ms98-a-0011 76.484125 81.701500 and yet we've had breast cancer problems for years and it's just one of those
sw3161A-ms98-a-0012 81.701500 88.383750 well of course one of the shows i saw was taking it from the angle that since it doesn't effect men it's not gonna get funded
sw3161A-ms98-a-0013 88.383750 91.613000 and uh having thought about that for a while
sw3161A-ms98-a-0014 91.613000 100.461625 [noise] well i i kind of i thought well that that might be possible since there are a lot of men in control of that kind of thing but then i go[t]- i got to thinking
sw3161A-ms98-a-0015 100.461625 111.828250 the the number one killer of men seems to be the prostate and there's only one test that just recently got developed uh a blood an[tigen]- antigen uh [vocalized-noise] antibody test for the antigen in the blood
sw3161A-ms98-a-0016 111.828250 116.309875 and that's fairly recent and yet men have been dying from prostate cancer for years
sw3161A-ms98-a-0017 116.309875 124.349125 so it's not really cure f[or]- yeah it's not uh not that heavily funded either and that seems to be one of the the major
sw3161A-ms98-a-0018 124.349125 134.200875 uh problems that men have in the realm of cancer so i don't know i i guess there's just some strange public opinion as to who they want to give to um be it
sw3161A-ms98-a-0019 134.200875 141.191875 through different organizations March of Dimes type uh telethons or or bicycle rides or whatever
sw3161A-ms98-a-0020 141.191875 147.497875 how they fund whatever um illness they wish i[t's]- it's kind of hard to
sw3161A-ms98-a-0021 147.497875 161.786250 to get an even keel on that i mean it's really hard to say well there's you know a hundred thousand per year affected by this one so let's give it this amount and then this other one's only a tenth of that so give it a tenth of that and and just keep doling it out that way or
sw3161A-ms98-a-0022 161.786250 180.949125 [silence]
sw3161A-ms98-a-0023 180.949125 182.337250 right
sw3161A-ms98-a-0024 182.337250 208.577125 [silence]
sw3161A-ms98-a-0025 208.577125 209.893250 right
sw3161A-ms98-a-0026 209.893250 225.672750 [silence]
sw3161A-ms98-a-0027 225.672750 227.106875 that's true
sw3161A-ms98-a-0028 227.106875 236.104125 you know the the other thought that i had um i've had several minutes to think about this after i uh while i was finding people i uh
sw3161A-ms98-a-0029 236.104125 240.419125 i could think about the topic longer than the person that receives it so it's kind of a
sw3161A-ms98-a-0030 240.419125 242.851625 a unfair advantage as they were but
sw3161A-ms98-a-0031 242.851625 247.446125 the other thing that i've thought of on this is i wonder if there isn't enough money
sw3161A-ms98-a-0032 247.446125 257.836250 uh in our economy or in our system uh it seems like there's so much that goes to things that don't really do a whole lot of good i mean yeah they're kind of nice but
sw3161A-ms98-a-0033 257.836250 272.624125 we have such an affluent -[s]ociety society that i wonder if if we took a little from here and there and the other if we might wind up with a uh cure for just about everything of course then we wouldn't have any room to put people but [laughter-that's]
sw3161A-ms98-a-0034 272.624125 284.325000 yeah you know you hear these ridiculous figures for pizza or you hear these these [vocalized-noise] phenomenal amount of dollars spent for this that or the other and then you have all the arts that that are nice and aesthetic but
sw3161A-ms98-a-0035 284.325000 293.248250 are they that enhancing for the m[asses]- for the masses you know they certainly do well for those who go to the symphony orchestra and all that but uh
sw3161A-ms98-a-0036 293.248250 297.538000 had all that donation and time and labor and effort gone toward something else
