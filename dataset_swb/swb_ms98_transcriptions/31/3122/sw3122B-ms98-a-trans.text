sw3122B-ms98-a-0069 250.010625 255.805875 and we don't want a fenced in backyard we're on a corner and we look out at a creek and a park
sw3122B-ms98-a-0070 255.805875 259.116750 and we just you know one reason we
sw3122B-ms98-a-0071 259.116750 262.327375 yeah i guess it would have to be and we
sw3122B-ms98-a-0072 262.327375 264.398875 yeah that's true

sw3122B-ms98-a-0079 288.857500 300.194750 you know he had more problems over pets um in both rental houses and houses that people owned and other people looked at it and didn't like the way it smelled and so so that's my main
sw3122B-ms98-a-0080 300.194750 301.455375 objection
sw3122B-ms98-a-0081 301.455375 302.781875 [silence]

sw3122B-ms98-a-0087 332.242625 337.060750 so bad that we had to go ahead and um recarpet the entire house [laughter]
sw3122B-ms98-a-0088 337.060750 351.451625 and uh when they pulled the carpeting up it was so bad on the back there were so many spots you just wouldn't believe and um th[ey]- they we had to have a exterminating company come in and they had to treat the concrete slab
sw3122B-ms98-a-0089 351.451625 363.445500 and they had to wear you know gas masks and stuff so we moved everything from one half of the house to the other half and you know then g[ot]- took took that well actually both
sw3122B-ms98-a-0090 363.445500 369.195000 tha[t]- um took that part of the carpeting up and then treated that and we had to stay out of the house for
sw3122B-ms98-a-0091 369.195000 378.537250 you know ten hours or something and then we came back and then they put the new carpet down there moved the furniture back to that half of the [laughter-house] and ha[d]- had to do it again
sw3122B-ms98-a-0092 378.537250 379.666500 [silence]
sw3122B-ms98-a-0093 379.666500 391.614875 yeah no they usually don't yeah yeah so anyway we've had that that was a very bad experience [laughter] well i don't really think we're going to have any more indoor pets
