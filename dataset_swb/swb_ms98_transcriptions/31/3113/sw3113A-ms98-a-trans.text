sw3113A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 2.857750 [silence]
sw3113A-ms98-a-0002 2.857750 15.421750 okay well i uh i guess because i work quite a bit with lawyers i'm not a lawyer uh that i find a lot of things are so specialized that i'm not sure
sw3113A-ms98-a-0003 15.421750 29.999250 and i i look at it more from the civil side of things that juries have any sense of of the value of and worth so that they have real problems when it comes to uh uh they can find guilt or innocence
sw3113A-ms98-a-0004 29.999250 44.024000 uh but then when you quantify things and that might also hold criminal trials for how many years is appropriate uh that they might leave it to somebody else who uh has expertise in that
sw3113A-ms98-a-0005 44.024000 61.383875 [silence]
sw3113A-ms98-a-0006 61.383875 62.735125 uh-huh
sw3113A-ms98-a-0007 62.735125 69.889625 [silence]
sw3113A-ms98-a-0008 69.889625 82.130875 yeah because_1 i find that uh i've been on a few juries and uh as a say i i tend to be around uh civil cases
sw3113A-ms98-a-0009 82.130875 86.528000 because i've been an expert witness some and uh
sw3113A-ms98-a-0010 86.528000 96.441375 many matters are so complicated that it's so hard to uh come up with the fair value uh
sw3113A-ms98-a-0011 96.441375 102.310875 or the fair sentence and one thing that you get if you have some expertise is
sw3113A-ms98-a-0012 102.310875 111.935250 uh you know the range of of possible values or terms or you know how heinous was the crime
sw3113A-ms98-a-0013 111.935250 119.490750 uh that uh when i only do something one two or three times i'm hardly an expert on it and
sw3113A-ms98-a-0014 119.490750 121.391750 most juries
sw3113A-ms98-a-0015 121.391750 125.376125 over a period of five or ten years you might sit on three
sw3113A-ms98-a-0016 125.376125 129.597625 and so how do you relate as to whether this
sw3113A-ms98-a-0017 129.597625 135.500500 particular armed robbery was a you know worth five years or twenty five
sw3113A-ms98-a-0018 135.500500 144.040750 [silence]
sw3113A-ms98-a-0019 144.040750 144.942250 um-hum
sw3113A-ms98-a-0020 144.942250 153.550625 [silence]
sw3113A-ms98-a-0021 153.550625 154.734000 yes
sw3113A-ms98-a-0022 154.734000 166.907250 [silence]
sw3113A-ms98-a-0023 166.907250 168.129750 um-hum
sw3113A-ms98-a-0024 168.129750 170.896875 [silence]
sw3113A-ms98-a-0025 170.896875 171.954250 yeah
sw3113A-ms98-a-0026 171.954250 191.249625 [silence]
sw3113A-ms98-a-0027 191.249625 192.898375 um-hum
sw3113A-ms98-a-0028 192.898375 203.916875 [silence]
sw3113A-ms98-a-0029 203.916875 205.221375 um-hum
sw3113A-ms98-a-0030 205.221375 209.765750 [silence]
sw3113A-ms98-a-0031 209.765750 216.196375 well one of the others things that gets me on on the juries is that often in the newspaper
sw3113A-ms98-a-0032 216.196375 221.584250 i i tend to hear two things well that go on one is you often see in the headlines
sw3113A-ms98-a-0033 221.584250 223.839000 the big numbers
sw3113A-ms98-a-0034 223.839000 231.304375 uh and many of those get overturned or get reduced in terms of sentences or get changed
sw3113A-ms98-a-0035 231.304375 239.152875 by a judge or an Appeals Court and that never makes the the press and so when uh you or i as an individual 
sw3113A-ms98-a-0036 239.152875 246.201375 gets on a jury we tend to have certain mental images of what's what because we see the headlines
sw3113A-ms98-a-0037 246.201375 254.276625 uh and we don't have uh again a lot of knowledge so we don't know what is really going on what is uh
sw3113A-ms98-a-0038 254.276625 264.251750 really the range of sentences or awards that are uh are actually uh in the end applied
sw3113A-ms98-a-0039 264.251750 283.025125 [silence]
sw3113A-ms98-a-0040 283.025125 284.401000 um-hum
sw3113A-ms98-a-0041 284.401000 294.585125 [silence]
sw3113A-ms98-a-0042 294.585125 296.694250 um-hum
sw3113A-ms98-a-0043 296.694250 316.103875 [silence]
sw3113A-ms98-a-0044 316.103875 317.175500 yeah
sw3113A-ms98-a-0045 317.175500 319.639875 [silence]
sw3113A-ms98-a-0046 319.639875 332.764250 well that's where uh uh the role of juries is is restricted and uh i'm not sure i'd want to change that aspect of it one is it's restricted in the sense that 
sw3113A-ms98-a-0047 332.764250 344.733750 juries only decide the charges that are actually uh brought you know if it's first degree rape second deg[ree]- degree rape or whatever
sw3113A-ms98-a-0048 344.733750 359.229000 they only get to decide on that well okay this person has been charged with first degree rape uh and you can decide guilt or innocence on that uh such like maybe in murder they get to choose whether it's uh premeditated or
sw3113A-ms98-a-0049 359.229000 372.239875 one or two of the lesser degrees an[d]- the other thing that juries are restricted on and and at least to me this has been one of the frustrating things in my even in my own experiences that you
sw3113A-ms98-a-0050 372.239875 379.206250 usually don't get to hear all the information it's what information is presented and
sw3113A-ms98-a-0051 379.206250 391.863500 uh i don't know that juries have a right to know more because in a sense we call those safeguards but often juries hear only a fraction of the of the story
sw3113A-ms98-a-0052 391.863500 394.435625 when they have to decide guilt or innocence
sw3113A-ms98-a-0053 394.435625 406.763250 [silence]
sw3113A-ms98-a-0054 406.763250 408.095375 um-hum
sw3113A-ms98-a-0055 408.095375 413.151625 [silence]
sw3113A-ms98-a-0056 413.151625 422.378875 yeah and the truth that's brought out is uh as i say when i've heard about you know the oath is to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth
sw3113A-ms98-a-0057 422.378875 433.980625 is that they want uh they don't want uh the whole truth i mean you can say yeah the because stories look very different when you hear different parts of the of the truth
sw3113A-ms98-a-0058 433.980625 449.706500 [silence]
