sw3113B-ms98-a-0002 1.578000 3.071125 okay
sw3113B-ms98-a-0003 3.071125 29.646875 [silence]
sw3113B-ms98-a-0004 29.646875 32.488750 right
sw3113B-ms98-a-0005 32.488750 43.422625 [silence]
sw3113B-ms98-a-0006 43.422625 57.944000 right i agree too i don't think the jury should be the ones that that put the [sensings/sentencings] sentencings down i think the judges should or even a panel of of lawyers if if it got to that point
sw3113B-ms98-a-0007 57.944000 62.253875 might be better apt than just regular civil people
sw3113B-ms98-a-0008 62.253875 70.427500 not knowing you know exactly what things are [vocalized-noise] from from murder on up to like tax stuff you know
sw3113B-ms98-a-0009 70.427500 110.584625 [silence]
sw3113B-ms98-a-0010 110.584625 112.546000 right
sw3113B-ms98-a-0011 112.546000 124.954375 [silence]
sw3113B-ms98-a-0012 124.954375 126.763875 yeah and
sw3113B-ms98-a-0013 126.763875 134.952750 [silence]
sw3113B-ms98-a-0014 134.952750 149.425500 right that's yeah an[d]- and and most people that do sit on juries some people just sit on them once in their lifetime you know if they're that lucky sometimes [laughter] or you know what whatever the case may be and and may not have any idea
sw3113B-ms98-a-0015 149.425500 162.956500 of what what the standard punishment would be for it and it they may have some different idea i mean it might be more important for them to put a sen[tencing]- sen[tencing]- sentencing down that was uh
sw3113B-ms98-a-0016 162.956500 167.500000 longer you know that didn't fit the punishment didn't fit the crime
sw3113B-ms98-a-0017 167.500000 172.068000 or not long enough or you know whatever the case may be
sw3113B-ms98-a-0018 172.068000 185.924125 i i think the judges do have that that better knowledge of it the only thing i worry about sometimes is if if you get somebody in there that that has a name that is the defendant and
sw3113B-ms98-a-0019 185.924125 197.818625 you know sometimes might ha[ve]- have more pull which that does happen i mean w[e]- we can't say it doesn't because it does happen i mean not everybody is is you know
sw3113B-ms98-a-0020 197.818625 204.838750 has has the right morals sometimes and people can be paid off or politically or
sw3113B-ms98-a-0021 204.838750 209.850750 whatever the case may be and sometimes that's not real fair either though so
sw3113B-ms98-a-0022 209.850750 223.313250 [silence]
sw3113B-ms98-a-0023 223.313250 224.330000 um-hum
sw3113B-ms98-a-0024 224.330000 230.649875 [silence]
sw3113B-ms98-a-0025 230.649875 232.097000 right
sw3113B-ms98-a-0026 232.097000 262.523125 [silence]
sw3113B-ms98-a-0027 262.523125 274.618750 right right well well also what i don't think is fair either is when you have like a say a rapist come in and and his attorney
sw3113B-ms98-a-0028 274.618750 283.719625 gets his sentences sentencing reduced because he's gone to a lesser charge like i don't know what assault or something or
sw3113B-ms98-a-0029 283.719625 298.318250 but which that doesn't make any sense to me either i know it's hard to prove rape and whatnot and and and the person that was raped or whatever doesn't i mean it's embarrassing and all this other stuff and they they're put on like
sw3113B-ms98-a-0030 298.318250 303.501125 they were the ones that caused it or whatever but to me when you do the crime
sw3113B-ms98-a-0031 303.501125 316.612250 then you should pay for whatever you did and and you shouldn't be able to go on the lesser charge i don't i don't think that's right because all's that's going to do is say oh well you know that was a breeze i can go out and do it again and you know
sw3113B-ms98-a-0032 316.612250 320.114500 have the same thing happen that's that's not right
sw3113B-ms98-a-0033 320.114500 339.643250 [silence]
sw3113B-ms98-a-0034 339.643250 341.984250 right
sw3113B-ms98-a-0035 341.984250 352.950000 [silence]
sw3113B-ms98-a-0036 352.950000 354.804375 um-hum
sw3113B-ms98-a-0037 354.804375 375.305875 [silence]
sw3113B-ms98-a-0038 375.305875 377.176375 yeah
sw3113B-ms98-a-0039 377.176375 393.676375 [silence]
sw3113B-ms98-a-0040 393.676375 407.560000 and to me how can you how can you make a decision if you don't have all of the evidence in front of whether it be whether it pertains to the case or not somebody thinks it it had because they've got it there
sw3113B-ms98-a-0041 407.560000 414.645750 [vocalized-noise] so the lawyers the two lawyers are the ones that have all the information don't they
sw3113B-ms98-a-0042 414.645750 426.341250 [silence]
sw3113B-ms98-a-0043 426.341250 428.588500 they only put part of it
sw3113B-ms98-a-0044 428.588500 429.312750 yeah
sw3113B-ms98-a-0045 429.312750 433.337000 [silence]
sw3113B-ms98-a-0046 433.337000 438.725250 right well that's just like that old witness game well it's a game kids play too but um
sw3113B-ms98-a-0047 438.725250 441.322125 somebody did it just ah
sw3113B-ms98-a-0048 441.322125 445.421125 just for your train of thought where they they showed something
sw3113B-ms98-a-0049 445.421125 449.706500 and they asked there there there were uh like four people
