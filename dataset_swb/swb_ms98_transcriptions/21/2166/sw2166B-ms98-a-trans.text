sw2166B-ms98-a-0094 391.508000 401.290375 yeah there's there's kind of a a little place set up like that i know that they've got one in Austin and San Antonio and one in uh Houston it's called You Are Cook
sw2166B-ms98-a-0095 401.290375 412.486625 and that's exactly what you are and it a it turned out it's a cattle rancher who owns the restaurant and has his own cattle so it's an ongoing circle
sw2166B-ms98-a-0096 412.486625 426.473000 you know and you uh you get your all your salad and everything for your salad is at one part of the restaurant and then everything for a baked potato and everything you can imagine to put on it is another section and then right smack in the middle is these
sw2166B-ms98-a-0097 426.473000 428.978125 three huge grills
sw2166B-ms98-a-0098 428.978125 434.487375 that they have set up for the people to use and you go in and you pick out your own selection of meat
sw2166B-ms98-a-0099 434.487375 447.957500 that you want to to cook you know filet or T bone or whatever it is and they're just huge then there you know there the meat is just massive just massive i think the small[est]- the smallest they have is

sw2166B-ms98-a-0101 448.985625 461.974750 uh i think a nine ounce filet i mean just we're ta[king]- taking doggy bags home every time we go and it's it's it's like twelve dollars a person but you are you're getting three or four meals out of [laughter-it] by the time you take it home
sw2166B-ms98-a-0102 461.974750 467.492000 yeah you take it up to the grill and you flip it or or they'll cook it they'll charge you an extra dollar to cook it for you
sw2166B-ms98-a-0103 467.492000 468.509500 [silence]
sw2166B-ms98-a-0104 468.509500 472.487875 yeah it's really a lot of fun because_1 they get up there and

sw2166B-ms98-a-0106 475.470000 483.243000 and you know sit around and and just talk while it's cooking and some people go back and eat their salads and leave it there most people stay up there so they get to
sw2166B-ms98-a-0107 483.243000 496.986625 take their own [laughter-steak] [laughter-back] [laughter-to] [laughter-their] [laughter-table] but uh it's really neat i never thought it would go over much because nobody you know i don't want to cook my own dinner i want to go out and you know pay for it but it's really a it's really a neat phenomena how it all works out
