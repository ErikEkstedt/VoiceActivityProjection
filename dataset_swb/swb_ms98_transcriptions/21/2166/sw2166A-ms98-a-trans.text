sw2166A-ms98-a-0019 59.689750 68.743750 i haven't been to Steak and Ale for a long time but my favorite used to be their steak and uh Alaskan king crab oh that was good
sw2166A-ms98-a-0020 68.743750 72.989500 [silence]
sw2166A-ms98-a-0021 72.989500 74.785250 yeah
sw2166A-ms98-a-0022 74.785250 82.231375 yeah they they had they had really nice Alaskan king crab of course it was expensive though dinner for two was about fifty bucks 
sw2166A-ms98-a-0023 82.231375 83.519500 uh-huh
sw2166A-ms98-a-0024 83.519500 93.963500 and now that i'm full time poor student uh i got to watch the pennies [laughter] consequently that's why you go out to Mongolian all the time
sw2166A-ms98-a-0025 93.963500 103.259625 [silence]
sw2166A-ms98-a-0026 103.259625 117.974375 yeah i haven't found a good Mexican restaurant around here anywhere i i'm at i usually do all my own Mexican food i my i'm partial to burritos and tacos and i and i do them better than anywhere i've had out so
sw2166A-ms98-a-0027 117.974375 121.478000 and i can do them cheaper and i can do them my way
sw2166A-ms98-a-0028 121.478000 122.726500 [silence]
sw2166A-ms98-a-0029 122.726500 124.714875 and places place
sw2166A-ms98-a-0030 124.714875 128.475750 [silence]
sw2166A-ms98-a-0031 128.475750 141.996750 uh basically the food and the price i it's sort it's set up on a sort of a buffet sort of thing you go up and pick your own vegetables and all that fill up your own plate and then you drop it off at the uh grill
sw2166A-ms98-a-0032 141.996750 151.978125 and then go sit down and they they fry it out and season it the way you want it seasoned and then they bring it out to you and the price is really reasonable the the drawback is that
sw2166A-ms98-a-0033 151.978125 160.186500 all the uh all the staff are uh are uh either Koreans or uh
sw2166A-ms98-a-0034 160.186500 173.683125 or Thais and they can't speak English very well so it gets a little bit difficult trying to explain uh some things to them but if you can get past that it's okay the food is really good
sw2166A-ms98-a-0035 173.683125 187.965875 i don't know i to me that's the thing that you got to have if the food is bad you're obviously not going to go back but if the food is good and the price is decent and the service is lousy i have a tough time going back again
sw2166A-ms98-a-0036 187.965875 195.964000 course a yeah yeah i mean it's it's not worth the hassle just for the good food there's plenty of places that have good food
sw2166A-ms98-a-0037 195.964000 227.956500 [silence]
sw2166A-ms98-a-0038 227.956500 237.498625 uh-huh yeah yeah i i hardly ever give the people a second try if if somebody's rude to me or
sw2166A-ms98-a-0039 237.498625 238.662375 [noise]
sw2166A-ms98-a-0040 238.662375 244.496250 excuse me somebody's rude or something like that i won't go back i don't care how good the food was
sw2166A-ms98-a-0041 244.496250 255.702125 but generally i i the places i've been where i've had trouble with the help generally the food hasn't been that good anyway which is sort of indicative of the whole problem
sw2166A-ms98-a-0042 255.702125 256.739500 [silence]
sw2166A-ms98-a-0043 256.739500 257.996875 uh

sw2166A-ms98-a-0045 259.226875 265.758500 well gosh now what [laughter] i guess it's been about five minutes
sw2166A-ms98-a-0046 265.758500 267.228750 [silence]
sw2166A-ms98-a-0047 267.228750 274.979125 i try to go out once a week sometimes more than that i about every other weekend i go down to Charlotte and uh
sw2166A-ms98-a-0048 274.979125 283.960750 see my my ex-college buddy down there and uh we go out running around down there and there's some pretty good places down there to eat
sw2166A-ms98-a-0049 283.960750 293.452875 but we've got a uh family there's a family restaurant here i don't know if they're over in Texas yet i know they're in Louisiana it's called Ryan's
sw2166A-ms98-a-0050 293.452875 303.445375 um it's a it's a good restaurant they uh they have like a big food bar and you can order from the menu or
sw2166A-ms98-a-0051 303.445375 317.944000 uh just take the food bar and the food bar usually has all kinds of entree items or salads and all that and they've just got tons of stuff and it's really cheap one person for about it's about six bucks and it's all you can eat
sw2166A-ms98-a-0052 317.944000 330.775375 and the food is good and of course you your service is pretty good because it's serve yourself can't complain too much they they they have people come around and uh
sw2166A-ms98-a-0053 330.775375 339.758125 deliver your your meal from the kitchen if you ordered a steak or something and fill up your iced tea but other than that they don't they don't bother you
sw2166A-ms98-a-0054 339.758125 343.792125 so it's a pretty good place i bet you don't have those over there
sw2166A-ms98-a-0055 343.792125 344.992625 [silence]
sw2166A-ms98-a-0056 344.992625 346.985875 we have uh
sw2166A-ms98-a-0057 346.985875 360.743750 there's two of them in Charlotte and we've been to both of them and they're both terrible it was it was i was amazed because i've been in a lot of Ryan's in Alabama and Georgia
sw2166A-ms98-a-0058 360.743750 364.712125 and this is my first time in one in North Carolina and they were terrible
sw2166A-ms98-a-0059 364.712125 365.803625 [noise]
sw2166A-ms98-a-0060 365.803625 371.980875 and we got one in Raleigh here and i thought it was pretty bad until i had gone to those ones in Charlotte
sw2166A-ms98-a-0061 371.980875 382.307750 yeah we we figured this is probably the best one but uh it's it's a pretty neat chain because they they don't take out loans for anything they
sw2166A-ms98-a-0062 382.307750 393.486500 when they build a building they pay for it right then so that when they open the door they're making money immediately it's it's a smart operation
sw2166A-ms98-a-0063 393.486500 400.197375 [silence]
sw2166A-ms98-a-0064 400.197375 402.271000 [laughter]

sw2166A-ms98-a-0078 472.977500 483.460000 [silence]
sw2166A-ms98-a-0079 483.460000 484.490000 yeah

sw2166A-ms98-a-0081 485.736500 490.790875 [silence]
sw2166A-ms98-a-0082 490.790875 492.279125 [laughter]
sw2166A-ms98-a-0083 492.279125 493.767250 [silence]
sw2166A-ms98-a-0084 493.767250 497.732750 yeah that sounds pretty neat it'd be worth giving a try
sw2166A-ms98-a-0085 497.732750 499.488375 [silence]
sw2166A-ms98-a-0086 499.488375 504.491875 that's pretty interesting i've never heard of anything like that
sw2166A-ms98-a-0087 504.491875 505.990625 [silence]
sw2166A-ms98-a-0088 505.990625 507.767000 yeah [laughter]

sw2166A-ms98-a-0091 512.486875 520.522125 that's a unique idea i gue[ss]- i guess that's part of the game nowadays in fast food you got to come up with some catchy idea
sw2166A-ms98-a-0092 520.522125 523.476375 [silence]
sw2166A-ms98-a-0093 523.476375 525.231625 yeah
sw2166A-ms98-a-0094 525.231625 528.489000 he he surely doesn't have to worry about supply
sw2166A-ms98-a-0095 528.489000 530.719500 that's a pretty good idea
sw2166A-ms98-a-0096 530.719500 531.980250 huh
sw2166A-ms98-a-0097 531.980250 534.737375 maybe i'll start a restaurant now

sw2166A-ms98-a-0099 536.496000 540.009125 i don't know if i trust these people in Raleigh to cook anything though
sw2166A-ms98-a-0100 540.009125 542.719875 probably burn the place down
sw2166A-ms98-a-0101 542.719875 548.494750 [silence]
sw2166A-ms98-a-0102 548.494750 551.803125 well come to think i've never even seen a Mexican here
