sw2110B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 4.799750 [silence]
sw2110B-ms98-a-0002 4.799750 10.747625 [laughter] uh i was thinking about whether or not we should have people
sw2110B-ms98-a-0003 10.747625 23.582000 uh be required to do s[ervice]- public service for a year or two and i was thinking that you needed to put some waivers in there for the handicapped and also for people that had to stay home and maybe be wage earners for their family
sw2110B-ms98-a-0004 23.582000 29.943875 or they had somebody at home that was ill that they had to tend to i mean you can't make it everybody
sw2110B-ms98-a-0005 29.943875 39.441125 but then you need to make it sure that the rich people can't buy somebody off and and maybe send them in their place or or get out of it some other way
sw2110B-ms98-a-0006 39.441125 40.810250 too
sw2110B-ms98-a-0007 40.810250 54.276500 [silence]
sw2110B-ms98-a-0008 54.276500 59.908125 [laughter] and then we could maybe give physicals to the rest of the family members right
sw2110B-ms98-a-0009 59.908125 61.616875 [silence]
sw2110B-ms98-a-0010 61.616875 65.152250 give physicals to the rest of the family members and they all had to pass
sw2110B-ms98-a-0011 65.152250 67.973125 [laughter]
sw2110B-ms98-a-0012 67.973125 79.766375 uh i thought it a good idea too though would be to extend this and make people that are accepting public welfare have to do something along this line before they got any money
sw2110B-ms98-a-0013 79.766375 90.707875 and uh if they did this maybe help them_1 out in their college cost and maybe they could pay people for doing this at least something so they c[ould]- could subsist
sw2110B-ms98-a-0014 90.707875 99.608375 [silence]
sw2110B-ms98-a-0015 99.608375 100.552000 yeah

sw2110B-ms98-a-0017 113.536375 125.436875 yeah and you know all these old people they would get out of this right all the ones that are already retired so what cou[ld]- we could do is take all the retired people that are going around in their big mobile homes
sw2110B-ms98-a-0018 125.436875 130.743625 [laughter] and they could do public service all over the country i'm just teasing
sw2110B-ms98-a-0019 130.743625 132.802375 [laughter]
sw2110B-ms98-a-0020 132.802375 139.257500 [silence]
sw2110B-ms98-a-0021 139.257500 148.094000 well i thought it'd be a good idea if maybe you took the some of the kids and had them go over to other countries and children from their countries came over to ours too
sw2110B-ms98-a-0022 148.094000 149.762250 a trade off
