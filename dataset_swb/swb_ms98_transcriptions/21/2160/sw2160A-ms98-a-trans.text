sw2160A-ms98-a-0022 50.888000 52.400500 [noise]
sw2160A-ms98-a-0023 52.400500 53.526500 okay
sw2160A-ms98-a-0024 53.526500 59.914000 so uh what do you think uh that uh wh[at]- what wh[at]- what do you think we can do to solve the crime in America
sw2160A-ms98-a-0025 59.914000 61.896750 [silence]
sw2160A-ms98-a-0026 61.896750 65.221250 yeah but what what what are the steps
sw2160A-ms98-a-0027 65.221250 76.361250 [silence]
sw2160A-ms98-a-0028 76.361250 79.228000 well see the problem is is that um
sw2160A-ms98-a-0029 79.228000 91.628250 what happens is as that you're uh you know as you go from the country to a city crime always increases right because in the country people still respect uh the property of other people
sw2160A-ms98-a-0030 91.628250 98.217750 and so as as and the people in the country don't want as much as the people in the city
sw2160A-ms98-a-0031 98.217750 109.429375 now what happens is all those that don't have any money in the country move to the cities and they wish to get the same thing they say why can't we have the same things that these other people have
sw2160A-ms98-a-0032 109.429375 119.926000 and the thing that we can do is we need money for drugs and what we have to do is we have to go there get some stuff steal it and then you know [vocalized-noise] resell it
sw2160A-ms98-a-0033 119.926000 122.394250 [silence]
sw2160A-ms98-a-0034 122.394250 123.859125 which one

sw2160A-ms98-a-0036 125.194500 129.243500 [silence]
sw2160A-ms98-a-0037 129.243500 142.215500 that's uh that's uh the main reason i think uh everywhere because uh you have deaths i mean i mean you have murders and you have you know people stealing other people's stuff and that's a lot of it has to do with drugs
sw2160A-ms98-a-0038 142.215500 147.279875 it doesn't have to do i mean the thing is is that you know it's like you might be standing somewhere
sw2160A-ms98-a-0039 147.279875 157.833500 right and like let's say you're you you go you know you're driving out and you're driving back home and it's late at night and you stop by one of these you know twenty four hour you know gas stations joints
sw2160A-ms98-a-0040 157.833500 171.905000 and uh somebody walks in there with a gun i mean they're going to want the money and you can tell by the people who are always caught that these people are there to get money for drugs i mean they don't want the money so uh so they can do something else with it
sw2160A-ms98-a-0041 171.905000 172.589875 [noise]
sw2160A-ms98-a-0042 172.589875 175.755250 right right and so

sw2160A-ms98-a-0050 226.492375 239.266500 yeah there's a there's a a song that i know which says you know that it's like in uh nineteen eighty eight nineteen eighty nine the local state and federal governments spent
sw2160A-ms98-a-0051 239.266500 243.984625 the least amount of money on crime in America
sw2160A-ms98-a-0052 243.984625 257.402500 and uh i their figures i think are true so i mean it's like compared to you know compared to weapons and stuff like that i mean you're spending nothing on on crime in the country itself what you're doing is
sw2160A-ms98-a-0053 257.402500 267.602125 you you know it's like you have other things you know it's like you have the AIDS we're going to solve try to solve the AIDS problem while while you know some people are getting killed here and there and then

sw2160A-ms98-a-0058 285.537375 294.546375 that that i see their theory is that if i'm surrounded and i'm going to be caught i'm going to try to pry my way through and they're not going to take me alive
sw2160A-ms98-a-0059 294.546375 299.495875 but i have such a big army outside of my place that nobody can touch me
