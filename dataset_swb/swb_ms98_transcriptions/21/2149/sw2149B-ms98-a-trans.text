sw2149B-ms98-a-0006 39.497875 46.225750 uh that kind of thing helping out uh volunteering i guess if they can

sw2149B-ms98-a-0032 148.994375 160.658000 pick up like on the highway and stuff and i think that's pretty neat they uh go along and have so many miles i guess of highway to take over and they clean it up
sw2149B-ms98-a-0033 160.658000 168.009500 and keep it clean i think that's a pretty good idea and i think you know again i've seen a lot of young kids doing that and i think it gets them_1 prepared to
sw2149B-ms98-a-0034 168.009500 180.220250 to learn how to volunteer as they get older i know i did you know in li[ke]- Girl Scouts and everything and after that in high school i would volunteer at a nursing home and stuff like that [noise] so
