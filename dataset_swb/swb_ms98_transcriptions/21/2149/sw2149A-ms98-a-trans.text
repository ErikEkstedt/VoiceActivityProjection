sw2149A-ms98-a-0049 352.999500 365.726000 that's that's uh that's real good we had uh we had organizations like that in college you know we had a community service group in college that had all sorts of different groups and some did like that some did elderly visits some did um
sw2149A-ms98-a-0050 365.726000 374.498875 some did you know Big Brother Big Sister stuff like that and i'm convinced that that that at least twenty five percent of our school participated in some sort of uh
sw2149A-ms98-a-0051 374.498875 387.960500 some sort of group you know ac[tivity]- activity like that you know twenty fi[ve]- i don't know <b_aside> twenty five percent <e_aside> yeah my wife was big in that [laughter] and she thinks yeah twenty five percent it's it was a small school [laughter] but [laughter-um] 
sw2149A-ms98-a-0052 387.960500 400.464625 yeah but i mean a a a lot of people would get involved and you know because_1 there were all different organizations to do there was Big Brother Big Sister they had a yearly auction they had a dance marathon for charity or to to to support that group
sw2149A-ms98-a-0053 400.464625 403.483250 such that you know lots of people got involved that way

sw2149A-ms98-a-0058 419.729625 426.227625 yeah they're not worth a year or some people unfort[unately]- just just can't even afford it you know or whatever i mean the Peace Corps doesn't pay very well
sw2149A-ms98-a-0059 426.227625 437.981875 you know people get shipped off and then you know and then and then their parents i have a um a a friend whose whose son is in the Peace Corps in Guatemala or daughter is in the Peace Corps in Guatemala right now
sw2149A-ms98-a-0060 437.981875 444.706000 and you know he and his wife just went off to visit her and you know i know i could never afford to go visit a kid in Guatemala
sw2149A-ms98-a-0061 444.706000 449.999125 you know [laughter-so] [laughter-so] i think you know and and and the kid's certainly not making much money
sw2149A-ms98-a-0062 449.999125 452.706875 so i can see where that that may be a problem

sw2149A-ms98-a-0064 465.470500 467.495125 [laughter]
