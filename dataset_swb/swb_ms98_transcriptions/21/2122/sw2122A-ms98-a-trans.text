sw2122A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.540000 [noise]
sw2122A-ms98-a-0002 0.540000 2.851750 okay so uh do you own a PC
sw2122A-ms98-a-0003 2.851750 5.055125 [silence]
sw2122A-ms98-a-0004 5.055125 6.427000 but you have one at work
sw2122A-ms98-a-0005 6.427000 8.162500 [silence]
sw2122A-ms98-a-0006 8.162500 14.078500 okay and now because um [noise] see i'm doing my uh Master's in Computer Science and Computer Engineering
sw2122A-ms98-a-0007 14.078500 21.466250 and um and i don't i don't have one but i have to use them_1 like during especially during my undergrad
sw2122A-ms98-a-0008 21.466250 34.222250 you you use um like your first couple of years you use personal computers because uh you know the software you know like it's easier for you to go and run a program you know through the disk
sw2122A-ms98-a-0009 34.222250 47.725625 because um the grader can do it at home then as the you know as you go up higher like in your senior level you're doing projects which are are so big and you have to have so many people sharing the same data
sw2122A-ms98-a-0010 47.725625 51.633125 that you can't use personal computers so you have to use you know a main frame
sw2122A-ms98-a-0011 51.633125 56.916875 [silence]
sw2122A-ms98-a-0012 56.916875 58.719125 oh okay
sw2122A-ms98-a-0013 58.719125 67.000000 [silence]
sw2122A-ms98-a-0014 67.000000 69.297125 but does it have uh like a disk drive
sw2122A-ms98-a-0015 69.297125 80.386125 oh okay because uh the ones that we use you you know are like Unix base systems and so they don't have a disk drive you know so you can't y[ou]- y[ou]- the only way that you can do it is through a modem
sw2122A-ms98-a-0016 80.386125 82.234375 and you you know you just
sw2122A-ms98-a-0017 82.234375 89.596125 do it that way but that's uh that's the only way that you can get to through to the system you can't store it anywhere
sw2122A-ms98-a-0018 89.596125 98.777625 [silence]
sw2122A-ms98-a-0019 98.777625 100.197875 oh okay
sw2122A-ms98-a-0020 100.197875 103.131125 and then you also have to do all your grading on the PC
sw2122A-ms98-a-0021 103.131125 108.604000 [silence]
sw2122A-ms98-a-0022 108.604000 109.878875 oh okay
sw2122A-ms98-a-0023 109.878875 110.992000 [silence]
sw2122A-ms98-a-0024 110.992000 112.213875 okay
sw2122A-ms98-a-0025 112.213875 118.299500 [silence]
sw2122A-ms98-a-0026 118.299500 119.601625 yeah
sw2122A-ms98-a-0027 119.601625 121.556250 [silence]
sw2122A-ms98-a-0028 121.556250 126.671000 well uh for us it's uh uh you know it's like for doing like you know like resumes
sw2122A-ms98-a-0029 126.671000 136.547125 and presentations we use like for example a Macintosh which is a lot easier for graphics than the P[C]- than you know the IBM PC's or anything compatible with that
sw2122A-ms98-a-0030 136.547125 149.489750 due due to the fact that well you know i- i haven't tested the the PS two yet but i don't know if the software is as easily you know like you can manage it a lot easier than than the old one the old one you had to go pick a line
sw2122A-ms98-a-0031 149.489750 157.296750 use little arrows to go onto the screen and check where you wanted to start and where you know with the mouse you do it you know like a hundred times faster
sw2122A-ms98-a-0032 157.296750 167.495750 and uh you also get you know when you see it on the Macintosh with you know the one i have that doesn't have any color you can look at it and that's the way it's going to print out
sw2122A-ms98-a-0033 167.495750 172.032500 and especially if you have a laser printer it's going to print out the same way as it's on the screen
sw2122A-ms98-a-0034 172.032500 173.972125 and so
sw2122A-ms98-a-0035 173.972125 183.492125 with you know with the IBM what would happen is uh since the software that i had was it was basically you know you only see part of the page
sw2122A-ms98-a-0036 183.492125 194.543000 and so the whole page you you never can actually see it you just draw it and they have to zoom out and zoom in and you know it's like every time that you have to do something is it's really a pain
sw2122A-ms98-a-0037 194.543000 208.967625 and also you know it's like for for presentations it's like if you have to do any statistical data it can be easily represented on a on a PC it can be easily represented on a on a PC you know like years back when you didn't have that you would have to map out all this all these numbers
sw2122A-ms98-a-0038 208.967625 218.101375 and get a graph which you weren't sure if it was okay or not you know but with a with a new system i can calculate everything so fast you know like for spread sheets
sw2122A-ms98-a-0039 218.101375 220.808875 you can see what the trend is over the years
sw2122A-ms98-a-0040 220.808875 222.761125 [silence]
sw2122A-ms98-a-0041 222.761125 223.830375 yeah that
sw2122A-ms98-a-0042 223.830375 224.951500 [silence]
sw2122A-ms98-a-0043 224.951500 239.263625 that i- i had a i had a program due and uh one one window i had the program and the other one i had the program running so if there was ever a mistake i could easily check you know i could look at the program and say this is where i made the error
sw2122A-ms98-a-0044 239.263625 249.353125 instead of saying where did i make the error you know go back and forth and and you know you always you know the old ones you had to go out of your program load up um
sw2122A-ms98-a-0045 249.353125 255.407500 uh well load up the program again in this case after you load it up change it hope that's right
sw2122A-ms98-a-0046 255.407500 267.073625 get out of that run the program run uh uh as long as it took and then go back and see if that worked or not but with windows you can have the program and say it messed up in line fifty four
sw2122A-ms98-a-0047 267.073625 270.977625 so you take a look at line fifty four you take a look at the output at the same time
sw2122A-ms98-a-0048 270.977625 280.440625 and you can see that where it messed up because you know it's like in the old computers the ones that uh we're using here a couple of years ago you would always have to have a printout
sw2122A-ms98-a-0049 280.440625 285.918875 every time that you ran your program you would need a printout because everything else was erased in the background
sw2122A-ms98-a-0050 285.918875 290.080000 [silence]
sw2122A-ms98-a-0051 290.080000 291.170875 di[d]-
sw2122A-ms98-a-0052 291.170875 293.357625 did you learn it in computer science
sw2122A-ms98-a-0053 293.357625 294.483750 [silence]
sw2122A-ms98-a-0054 294.483750 296.221625 and when was this
sw2122A-ms98-a-0055 296.221625 297.303500 [silence]
sw2122A-ms98-a-0056 297.303500 298.390500 oh okay
sw2122A-ms98-a-0057 298.390500 299.574750 [silence]
sw2122A-ms98-a-0058 299.574750 303.275750 yeah i know because uh all i know is that when i came here in eighty seven
sw2122A-ms98-a-0059 303.275750 309.090750 they still had uh it was the last year to to put all your punch cards in
sw2122A-ms98-a-0060 309.090750 310.111875 [silence]
sw2122A-ms98-a-0061 310.111875 321.007375 so yeah no but it it was just sensational because i walked in and they go oh my God they're still using this it was like this is the last year you can put your punch cards in and get your program out and you know [laughter]
sw2122A-ms98-a-0062 321.007375 323.878000 you can get a hard copy of it and that's about it
sw2122A-ms98-a-0063 323.878000 334.464500 so but i mean the price of computers has gone down they said that um if the auto industry would have kept the same trend as the computer industry has ever since you know it started
sw2122A-ms98-a-0064 334.464500 339.260375 they said that uh cars would cost two dollars and they would run forever
sw2122A-ms98-a-0065 339.260375 340.471875 [laughter]
sw2122A-ms98-a-0066 340.471875 349.103750 so i mean it's like you know the the joke with the Yugo you know it's like yeah you you know like when your uh car runs out of gas just throw it away
sw2122A-ms98-a-0067 349.103750 352.072125 and that that that's the way it would be you know it's like 
sw2122A-ms98-a-0068 352.072125 359.201000 yeah i think i'll buy a new car today you know so yeah but i mean the price has really gone down i mean IBM which um
sw2122A-ms98-a-0069 359.201000 364.206750 an IBM PC in like in nineteen eighty one it would cost you five thousand dollars
sw2122A-ms98-a-0070 364.206750 371.810250 and now you can get it you know like for one thousand dollars because uh you know because of the parts basically you know what
sw2122A-ms98-a-0071 371.810250 372.974500 [silence]
sw2122A-ms98-a-0072 372.974500 374.114125 yeah
sw2122A-ms98-a-0073 374.114125 386.353625 the the parts and the labor is what they're charging you they're not charging you you know over pricing it because it's like if we sell it for less you know it's like we're losing money [laughter-you] know it's like we want to sell it to break even at least
sw2122A-ms98-a-0074 386.353625 389.031250 and i think they stopped producing the IBM PC
sw2122A-ms98-a-0075 389.031250 393.090000 and uh and the uh PC Junior was a total failure
sw2122A-ms98-a-0076 393.090000 402.961500 to them_1 they had uh they're trying to get out small computers but the only problem was that when they took that one out the small computer was the IBM PC [laughter]
sw2122A-ms98-a-0077 402.961500 413.447375 and so you couldn't you know it's like sure bring out [vocalized-noise] into the market something that's smaller when no[body]- nobody uses anything that's smaller than you know this you know and so
sw2122A-ms98-a-0078 413.447375 425.570125 but over the past years IBM has been producing uh like every two years they bring out a whole new system you know like the P C B X T D A T and the PS one PS two things you know and so 
sw2122A-ms98-a-0079 425.570125 432.793750 it's just that you have to always compete and uh Macintosh took a lot of the market from a lot of schools
sw2122A-ms98-a-0080 432.793750 436.588000 because of of their you know you can work with it a lot easier
sw2122A-ms98-a-0081 436.588000 437.690875 [silence]
sw2122A-ms98-a-0082 437.690875 440.836875 so that's what they're trying to do oh well
sw2122A-ms98-a-0083 440.836875 445.875375 i'll leave you back to your work and uh have a good lunch all right bye bye
sw2122A-ms98-a-0084 445.875375 447.539375 [noise]
