sw2129B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.087250 [noise]
sw2129B-ms98-a-0002 0.087250 1.419625 all right
sw2129B-ms98-a-0003 1.419625 9.629375 [silence]
sw2129B-ms98-a-0004 9.629375 10.687625 yeah
sw2129B-ms98-a-0005 10.687625 13.096000 well i guess uh
sw2129B-ms98-a-0006 13.096000 20.559750 i i i'm kind of in uh in an unusual situation probably for this particular topic because i'm self-employed
sw2129B-ms98-a-0007 20.559750 22.193375 uh
sw2129B-ms98-a-0008 22.193375 26.876750 but yes i have worked i've worked for TI and i've worked for LTV
sw2129B-ms98-a-0009 26.876750 31.638875 uh and i suppose that uh
sw2129B-ms98-a-0010 31.638875 36.034125 so far as benefits are concerned the most important
sw2129B-ms98-a-0011 36.034125 43.641125 to uh me today would probably be uh something to do with retirement benefits
sw2129B-ms98-a-0012 43.641125 53.880000 at at this point in my life though i'm i'm i'm a little older probably than you know than the typical new employee would be anyway uh
sw2129B-ms98-a-0013 53.880000 59.790000 in you know in my younger days i i was interested in what's the vacation policy
sw2129B-ms98-a-0014 59.790000 65.447625 and then as i matured a little bit you know i was more interested in what are the insurance benefits you know
sw2129B-ms98-a-0015 65.447625 70.696500 but uh so i i you know i guess it from my point of view it depends on
sw2129B-ms98-a-0016 70.696500 72.606500 uh you know on
sw2129B-ms98-a-0017 72.606500 76.176625 where you are in life as to what's most important
sw2129B-ms98-a-0018 76.176625 77.706875 and uh
sw2129B-ms98-a-0019 77.706875 79.314000 yeah
sw2129B-ms98-a-0020 79.314000 86.815625 yeah uh you know if you're not uh if you haven't haven't looked forward to you know what are you going to do when you retire
sw2129B-ms98-a-0021 86.815625 94.557375 when you get to the point where you're looking forward to it then it gets to be important because you've got to do some planning for it uh you know especially if the company is not doing it for you
sw2129B-ms98-a-0022 94.557375 96.501875 and uh
sw2129B-ms98-a-0023 96.501875 103.666125 there are you know there are companies that do and there companies that don't you know that don't have good retirement plans
sw2129B-ms98-a-0024 103.666125 105.014250 uh
sw2129B-ms98-a-0025 105.014250 117.635375 i guess uh the companies that participate in the 401K type plans where you know you have the the uh option of contributing to uh to a retirement plan
sw2129B-ms98-a-0026 117.635375 125.120625 and uh maybe even the company does some kind of a matching program for that that's those are good programs uh
sw2129B-ms98-a-0027 125.120625 134.320000 i i i'm a CPA so i look at you know i get to see a lot of these uh a lot of different programs and things and along that line
sw2129B-ms98-a-0028 134.320000 140.763500 and uh i like to see where the company makes those makes benefits available at least to the employees
sw2129B-ms98-a-0029 140.763500 143.601125 so that they can pick and chose what they like uh
sw2129B-ms98-a-0030 143.601125 149.404625 you know there they've got one that they call a cafeteria plan i don't know whether you're familiar with that or not
sw2129B-ms98-a-0031 149.404625 154.198500 and uh essentially the cafeteria plans are programs where
sw2129B-ms98-a-0032 154.198500 167.879875 the company makes available a a different uh uh different packages of benefits you you know you can pick the kind of insurance you want and the kind of dental coverage and the kind of vacation policy you want an
sw2129B-ms98-a-0033 167.879875 177.341000 and all of these different things and you pick the ones that you want as long as the total cost to the company essentially the total cost to the company
sw2129B-ms98-a-0034 177.341000 182.949875 fits you know within their guidelines so every employee gets the same dollar amount of benefits
sw2129B-ms98-a-0035 182.949875 187.250125 but they can pick them from different whatever is most important to them
sw2129B-ms98-a-0036 187.250125 196.236000 so you can uh so you can get you know you can get the insurance plan that's important to you and somebody else can get the vacation plan that's important to them
sw2129B-ms98-a-0037 196.236000 202.093625 and the company winds up paying the same you know the same amount for each one
sw2129B-ms98-a-0038 202.093625 209.151875 uh i believe that you can that you can change well maybe not from year to year but at least you can change periodically
sw2129B-ms98-a-0039 209.151875 221.881750 uh as to you know as t[o]- to get the stuff that's more important to you yeah that's uh something that the uh that the federal government you know put into uh you know into the IRS regulations as uh as
sw2129B-ms98-a-0040 221.881750 234.343250 uh deductions uh allowable deductions for companies they put those in oh four of five years ago uh you know the the different insurance companies and things started promoting those plans
sw2129B-ms98-a-0041 234.343250 238.279375 and uh i i think there you know it's a pretty good option to have
sw2129B-ms98-a-0042 238.279375 244.406250 of course the 401[K]- 401K is is a good you know it's a good savings vehicle
sw2129B-ms98-a-0043 244.406250 246.199250 so uh
sw2129B-ms98-a-0044 246.199250 248.488500 anyway uh
sw2129B-ms98-a-0045 248.488500 252.928625 what kind of plans are you are you in now are what have you been in before
sw2129B-ms98-a-0046 252.928625 256.027750 [silence]
sw2129B-ms98-a-0047 256.027750 260.222500 well as so far as benefit packages indi[cate]- in total
sw2129B-ms98-a-0048 260.222500 265.088250 [silence]
sw2129B-ms98-a-0049 265.088250 266.706250 uh-huh

sw2129B-ms98-a-0056 298.629250 301.996000 yeah i understand that yeah
sw2129B-ms98-a-0057 301.996000 305.394875 [silence]

sw2129B-ms98-a-0060 309.736625 316.138875 right yeah it's and it's uh it it's uh uh a hassle trying to to uh
sw2129B-ms98-a-0061 316.138875 321.861250 uh put your money all in the right in the s[avings]- you know in the right pockets i guess it would be a way to say it
sw2129B-ms98-a-0062 321.861250 327.992000 you know to get everything do you have children and so so they i guess the uh
sw2129B-ms98-a-0063 327.992000 337.719375 yeah the yeah the medical insurance would really be a lot more important if you had uh if you had children i guess if you're of child bearing age then it's important too you know because
sw2129B-ms98-a-0064 337.719375 344.909875 you know because you got to have uh at least have the coverage in case that your in case you have another child or have a child
sw2129B-ms98-a-0065 344.909875 346.052125 and uh
