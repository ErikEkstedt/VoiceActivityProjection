sw2197A-ms98-a-0029 97.981000 101.381875 well i sort of one of the reasons it's taken so long is i've been working
sw2197A-ms98-a-0030 101.381875 107.642125 uh you know it's sort of half student half working and source of income and stuff so i'm actually managing to do this with zero debt

sw2197A-ms98-a-0033 120.207375 127.751250 yeah i think if there's any major piece of advice i'd give is to find a way of getting an education that doesn't incur that kind of debt
sw2197A-ms98-a-0034 127.751250 137.960125 it's not i mean i remember seeing an article one time about you know if the average person who spent that much money going to college just took the same amount of money and put it in a a in an investment fund
sw2197A-ms98-a-0035 137.960125 145.484625 they'd be considerably wealthier than they would be from the [laughter] job they'd get after college so it's it's really kind of crazy

sw2197A-ms98-a-0058 216.942250 219.420000 well my my real feeling about
sw2197A-ms98-a-0059 219.420000 222.951000 about the purpose of undergraduate education is
sw2197A-ms98-a-0060 222.951000 229.432375 it's really the time yes you do get an education you do learn some things but you eventually forget most of it
sw2197A-ms98-a-0061 229.432375 234.927125 but what you don't forget is the growing up it's really the period when people become adults
sw2197A-ms98-a-0062 234.927125 248.265250 i mean people who don't go to college become adults in other ways but really it's the entry into adulthood i think and i think that the best way to choose a college is to decide what kind of environment you want to
sw2197A-ms98-a-0063 248.265250 250.628000 be fostered in as you become
sw2197A-ms98-a-0064 250.628000 256.621875 you know as you gain new social skills as you become you know more of a functioning member of society
sw2197A-ms98-a-0065 256.621875 266.153000 and maybe the Air Force Academy is appropriate as you said for someone who you know a more you know who needs to learn self-discipline and so forth would be appropriate for them
sw2197A-ms98-a-0066 266.153000 272.618625 [silence]
sw2197A-ms98-a-0067 272.618625 275.000500 yeah and want to develop that

sw2197A-ms98-a-0083 339.858750 345.453000 um-hum um-hum yeah in high school everyone sort of tries to have the same opinion [laughter-it] [laughter-seems]
sw2197A-ms98-a-0084 345.453000 347.041375 [laughter]
sw2197A-ms98-a-0085 347.041375 354.362500 yeah the the one thing i think that's no good for anyone is these monster institutions these institutions of th[irty]- thirty thousand students
sw2197A-ms98-a-0086 354.362500 357.446375 [vocalized-noise] and i see some freshmen wandering around in there and they're
sw2197A-ms98-a-0087 357.446375 361.240625 they're just like you know someone from the country lost in the big city i mean they
sw2197A-ms98-a-0088 361.240625 363.455250 they i don't see them getting
sw2197A-ms98-a-0089 363.455250 370.148625 i mean when i was undergraduate i went to a relatively small school for my first two years and then i transferred to a very large school
sw2197A-ms98-a-0090 370.148625 375.120125 and that worked out pretty well i went from a you know a second rate institution to a higher rate institution
sw2197A-ms98-a-0091 375.120125 387.377000 but the first couple of years it doesn't matter to me what the quality of the education was i needed to make friends i needed to sort of learn the ropes you know there were things like that that mattered a lot more and i needed basic really simple education that you can get
sw2197A-ms98-a-0092 387.377000 390.415500 pretty much anywhere for the first couple of years
sw2197A-ms98-a-0093 390.415500 393.906250 yeah yeah exactly and if you're alienated
sw2197A-ms98-a-0094 393.906250 401.794750 i mean i see people at supposedly really good universities who are just having such psychological problems that you think this isn't sinking in

sw2197A-ms98-a-0113 464.834000 467.660000 i had known a lot of undergraduates who pick
sw2197A-ms98-a-0114 467.660000 475.368250 schools because they want the best reputation for a school not realizing that the reputation for MIT is because of the of the doctorate research
sw2197A-ms98-a-0115 475.368250 482.017625 and the professors who go there and you're not going to see the professors [laughter-you] [laughter-know] [laughter-you're] [laughter-going] [laughter-to] see some TA you know uh
sw2197A-ms98-a-0116 482.017625 492.076875 so they put they they want you know they want the best and they don't think they think what the best is is reputation for for research and that's a one standard but it's not relevant to what they need

sw2197A-ms98-a-0131 551.857125 563.885250 yeah you won't get that at MIT or Berkeley or anything like that and you can and you know you you can't blame the professors either because you look at their job description you'd see you know teaching is third down on the list of importance things and 
sw2197A-ms98-a-0132 563.885250 571.637750 yeah and and that's appropriate if the university is trying to do serious research because it's hard to be a researcher and a teacher at the same time
sw2197A-ms98-a-0133 571.637750 578.041250 so i'd say go to a go to a college that has teachers people who really are committed to the students and can afford to be because that's their job
