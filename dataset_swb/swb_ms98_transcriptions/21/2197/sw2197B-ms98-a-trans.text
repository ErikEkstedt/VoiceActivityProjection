sw2197B-ms98-a-0003 11.540000 14.329375 i'd encourage it
sw2197B-ms98-a-0004 14.329375 17.577375 it's a good general e[ducation]- ed[ucation]- education for a
sw2197B-ms98-a-0005 17.577375 19.670250 a bachelor's degree
sw2197B-ms98-a-0006 19.670250 22.247250 and obviously and obviously it's where they don't have a
sw2197B-ms98-a-0007 22.247250 25.636000 any post graduate program there but you get a
sw2197B-ms98-a-0008 25.636000 27.314375 an excellent
sw2197B-ms98-a-0009 27.314375 29.087375 wide
sw2197B-ms98-a-0010 29.087375 39.130625 uh basis of topics you know you get a good broad education out of it you don't they don't graduate the best engineers or the best English majors but
sw2197B-ms98-a-0011 39.130625 42.924125 maybe a graduate pretty good overall students out of there
sw2197B-ms98-a-0012 42.924125 44.511875 um

sw2197B-ms98-a-0014 52.445250 54.965000 well the
sw2197B-ms98-a-0015 54.965000 60.378625 for some people it's good because they maybe they need a little discipline need a little reining in at that
sw2197B-ms98-a-0016 60.378625 65.754875 that stage in their life uh other people it uh it's
sw2197B-ms98-a-0017 65.754875 69.966125 uh suffocating you know you kind of choke on it um
sw2197B-ms98-a-0018 69.966125 76.179250 it it depends on the person on the individual but uh the one factor i think
sw2197B-ms98-a-0019 76.179250 81.180625 more than anything else in this day and age that's got to
sw2197B-ms98-a-0020 81.180625 84.834625 be a big factor in your decision's just the the cost of
sw2197B-ms98-a-0021 84.834625 86.467250 how much you're gonna pay
sw2197B-ms98-a-0022 86.467250 88.483500 no matter where you go to school
sw2197B-ms98-a-0023 88.483500 95.380500 and if you've been in for twelve years i'm sure you've you've got a your share of student loans that uh you're
sw2197B-ms98-a-0024 95.380500 98.501875 probably going to be paying off or have been or

sw2197B-ms98-a-0049 202.453750 205.482750 somebody making twice what i was making how could you
sw2197B-ms98-a-0050 205.482750 207.604875 put half of that into
sw2197B-ms98-a-0051 207.604875 214.356500 to your child's education and then just when they make made make it to the college years it's
sw2197B-ms98-a-0052 214.356500 217.621625 my God i can't imagine

sw2197B-ms98-a-0059 265.158375 271.212375 or it's also a good environment it may be good for someone who already has self-discipline who has a certain amount of
sw2197B-ms98-a-0060 271.212375 274.014625 leadership quality in their own
sw2197B-ms98-a-0061 274.014625 279.208125 and that yeah the s[ame]- it's the same it can benefit different people different ways but uh
sw2197B-ms98-a-0062 279.208125 281.982375 you know i- i agree with that because_1 i see people
sw2197B-ms98-a-0063 281.982375 288.157750 that i know a again from high school that i still keep in touch with that didn't go to college and
sw2197B-ms98-a-0064 288.157750 290.918125 they do the same old things they did in high school
sw2197B-ms98-a-0065 290.918125 291.938375 and
sw2197B-ms98-a-0066 291.938375 294.554750 same patterns of behavior same
sw2197B-ms98-a-0067 294.554750 303.347500 uh same socializing same exact crowd that they hang with and it's like it's like frozen time [laughter-you] [laughter-know]

sw2197B-ms98-a-0069 304.991875 309.931875 it is it really is that they haven't found anything anything better that
sw2197B-ms98-a-0070 309.931875 316.834750 um or their experiences haven't been broadened at all that you know its a

sw2197B-ms98-a-0072 318.402625 326.660625 it's a tremendous thing when you sit in a in a college environment and discuss some issues and really sit there with people with disagreeing opinions and you hear
sw2197B-ms98-a-0073 326.660625 329.078500 all these different sides of the story
sw2197B-ms98-a-0074 329.078500 330.607500 that you never thought of
sw2197B-ms98-a-0075 330.607500 337.175500 and uh that's another big thing i think people get out of college is the appreciation for
sw2197B-ms98-a-0076 337.175500 341.901625 different point differing points of view you know or different opinions

sw2197B-ms98-a-0096 404.074250 408.750875 i work in a in a labora[tory]- an Air Force laboratory and so we've got a lot of uh
sw2197B-ms98-a-0097 408.750875 410.754625 MIT graduates that are in there
sw2197B-ms98-a-0098 410.754625 417.483125 and they are the biggest collection of screwed up people that [laughter-i] [laughter-think] [laughter-i've] [laughter-ever] [laughter-run] [laughter-into] even even more so
sw2197B-ms98-a-0099 417.483125 424.336875 uh like military academy grads are a strange lot too i- i mean i have to ad[mit]- confess to that
sw2197B-ms98-a-0100 424.336875 429.560000 yeah and they they have their own quirks and tolerances and
sw2197B-ms98-a-0101 429.560000 430.577500 you know
sw2197B-ms98-a-0102 430.577500 439.962875 certain things that don't bother us at all that would drive other people nuts and then certain things that ways things we do the way we do it that drive other people nuts that
sw2197B-ms98-a-0103 439.962875 445.791500 but these MIT grads are off in their absolute own world it it's a
sw2197B-ms98-a-0104 445.791500 452.189875 i- i have more re[spect]- i have a lot of respect for MIT master's and doctorate uh
sw2197B-ms98-a-0105 452.189875 456.612750 degrees but but their undergrads are like
sw2197B-ms98-a-0106 456.612750 462.014625 i i'm amazed at at that's a lot of them_1 even graduated
sw2197B-ms98-a-0107 462.014625 463.803875 but uh
sw2197B-ms98-a-0108 463.803875 465.087250 i don't know

sw2197B-ms98-a-0121 491.525625 498.056375 it's interesting that you mention that i didn't think about that before when you were talking but the service academies have all
sw2197B-ms98-a-0122 498.056375 503.491250 all the faculty uh for the most part is is military with a few exchange
sw2197B-ms98-a-0123 503.491250 505.591375 instruct professors from other
sw2197B-ms98-a-0124 505.591375 506.958000 schools but
sw2197B-ms98-a-0125 506.958000 513.363250 uh having the military faculty is really beneficial because they see it as
sw2197B-ms98-a-0126 513.363250 525.306875 doing their job and spending time with the cadets there uh is investing in the Air Force and it or the the military itself it's the future officer corps and so
sw2197B-ms98-a-0127 525.306875 528.094000 i hear horr[or]- horror stories from
sw2197B-ms98-a-0128 528.094000 532.804750 friends of mine that they could never see their instructors they could never get extra help
sw2197B-ms98-a-0129 532.804750 537.353875 for me any time i needed extra help any time of the day
sw2197B-ms98-a-0130 537.353875 546.073250 i had all my instructors home phone numbers and could call them you go to their office anytime i had some instructors that uh
sw2197B-ms98-a-0131 546.073250 548.958375 would invite me over to their house for extended
sw2197B-ms98-a-0132 548.958375 552.714375 study things on weekends when i was having trouble with something and

sw2197B-ms98-a-0143 580.492125 584.705500 yeah it's [vocalized-noise] there's a lot of factors that people 
sw2197B-ms98-a-0144 584.705500 587.661375 don't ever ever consider
sw2197B-ms98-a-0145 587.661375 592.840000 in in their selection of a college and uh i don't know maybe
sw2197B-ms98-a-0146 592.840000 598.630000 i wonder if if they enter these conversations that people have been having um that
