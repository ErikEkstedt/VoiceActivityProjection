sw2168B-ms98-a-0005 21.395625 25.900875 i have some real hang-ups i think that uh if your
sw2168B-ms98-a-0006 25.900875 29.650125 if your kid's not ambitious he can sure get lost
sw2168B-ms98-a-0007 29.650125 30.708250 [silence]

sw2168B-ms98-a-0020 63.439375 77.318625 over to uh to North Garland for ninth grade but at North Garland the the difficulty i see with the education system is that uh is that you can you can you can get some masses
sw2168B-ms98-a-0021 77.318625 82.015625 but u[nless]- unle[ss]- if the kid's really dedicated it seems like they do all right but if
sw2168B-ms98-a-0022 82.015625 90.417000 if if your child is just pressing along uh i i'm firmly convinced that teachers aren't being paid enough would you argue with that
sw2168B-ms98-a-0023 90.417000 92.506375 [silence]
sw2168B-ms98-a-0024 92.506375 103.129750 well you know the the the thing that i don't see and i i maybe you would take issue with it is that if if we went to if there was an opportunity for teachers to teach year around
sw2168B-ms98-a-0025 103.129750 104.596375 [silence]
sw2168B-ms98-a-0026 104.596375 106.234500 well would

sw2168B-ms98-a-0032 142.056500 144.192750 does it work well out there
sw2168B-ms98-a-0033 144.192750 150.691750 [silence]
sw2168B-ms98-a-0034 150.691750 153.507375 well what about the what about the issue of air conditioning
sw2168B-ms98-a-0035 153.507375 157.719000 isn't that a a [noise] a area of concern in the cost of air conditioning
sw2168B-ms98-a-0036 157.719000 161.555375 [silence]
sw2168B-ms98-a-0037 161.555375 162.660875 oh yeah i

sw2168B-ms98-a-0039 170.232625 171.784375 yeah
sw2168B-ms98-a-0040 171.784375 176.297625 yeah it's it's less degree days you're right but i think i think clearly
sw2168B-ms98-a-0041 176.297625 180.960000 [silence]
sw2168B-ms98-a-0042 180.960000 182.470625 yeah
sw2168B-ms98-a-0043 182.470625 187.387750 well how do they do it do they put uh long do they put two or three week breaks
sw2168B-ms98-a-0044 187.387750 189.230750 between
sw2168B-ms98-a-0045 189.230750 200.373250 [silence]
sw2168B-ms98-a-0046 200.373250 204.095875 is that from from what you've seen is that the desirable way to do it
sw2168B-ms98-a-0047 204.095875 206.177250 [silence]
sw2168B-ms98-a-0048 206.177250 209.019125 oh you said you had some people from California oh i thought you
sw2168B-ms98-a-0049 209.019125 211.301875 [silence]
sw2168B-ms98-a-0050 211.301875 213.602750 oh okay but you didn't go
sw2168B-ms98-a-0051 213.602750 217.365250 [silence]
sw2168B-ms98-a-0052 217.365250 227.584875 well the the other issue has to do that i hear that the local commentator i listen to David Golsome some the idea that the numbers of administrations and the fact that the principal
sw2168B-ms98-a-0053 227.584875 230.995250 do you see that the principals aren't really in charge
sw2168B-ms98-a-0054 230.995250 241.567625 [silence]
sw2168B-ms98-a-0055 241.567625 245.189625 well i had heard that one of the comments when they when they brought it
sw2168B-ms98-a-0056 245.189625 246.460000 [silence]
sw2168B-ms98-a-0057 246.460000 247.675500 hum
sw2168B-ms98-a-0058 247.675500 254.339625 the one of the the one they brought in the new uh superintendent for Dallas schools the adminis[trator]- um
sw2168B-ms98-a-0059 254.339625 262.409000 can't think of his name but the idea that yeah that he had suggested that that maybe they could reduce the number of administrators and
sw2168B-ms98-a-0060 262.409000 269.087625 and some of the people who were administrators saying that that uh that that's not what he was hired for
sw2168B-ms98-a-0061 269.087625 273.047500 but they resented the fact that he would try to save some costs there
sw2168B-ms98-a-0062 273.047500 282.599500 [silence]
sw2168B-ms98-a-0063 282.599500 283.880000 hum
sw2168B-ms98-a-0064 283.880000 291.043500 [silence]
sw2168B-ms98-a-0065 291.043500 300.951000 well the you know the other thing that bothers me is the amount of money that it co[st]- that it took to contest the the football um issue
sw2168B-ms98-a-0066 300.951000 302.019625 [silence]
sw2168B-ms98-a-0067 302.019625 305.463125 yeah but the i can't think of the name of the school that
sw2168B-ms98-a-0068 305.463125 309.484000 that uh but in any event they they they kept arguing that
sw2168B-ms98-a-0069 309.484000 312.292625 yeah and they went to court i mean
sw2168B-ms98-a-0070 312.292625 320.565625 uh you know i guess i'm i'm sympathetic with the kids but but how much money did that cost Dallas to to to to fight that in court 
sw2168B-ms98-a-0071 320.565625 324.469625 [silence]
sw2168B-ms98-a-0072 324.469625 328.602875 but just think of all the them all the lawyers you've kept employed see
sw2168B-ms98-a-0073 328.602875 331.243875 [laughter-that's] [laughter-ri[ght]-]
sw2168B-ms98-a-0074 331.243875 338.999000 [laughter-that's] [laughter-right] [laughter-and] and all these other people and out running around i i guess that's the only problem with jobs is being relatively scarce so
sw2168B-ms98-a-0075 338.999000 341.988500 but you need to keep all these people employed right
sw2168B-ms98-a-0076 341.988500 343.705125 and and
sw2168B-ms98-a-0077 343.705125 344.960750 [laughter]
sw2168B-ms98-a-0078 344.960750 349.446250 you mean you mean we need a little more of our tax money like maybe uh
sw2168B-ms98-a-0079 349.446250 363.365750 [silence]
sw2168B-ms98-a-0080 363.365750 364.756000 yeah
sw2168B-ms98-a-0081 364.756000 366.410375 [silence]
sw2168B-ms98-a-0082 366.410375 367.813875 well
sw2168B-ms98-a-0083 367.813875 392.031000 [silence]
sw2168B-ms98-a-0084 392.031000 393.562000 oh that's
sw2168B-ms98-a-0085 393.562000 396.850750 [silence]
sw2168B-ms98-a-0086 396.850750 401.129000 hum that's interesting and how many administrators is that going to take
sw2168B-ms98-a-0087 401.129000 419.493750 [silence]
sw2168B-ms98-a-0088 419.493750 420.834000 yeah
sw2168B-ms98-a-0089 420.834000 428.850375 [silence]
sw2168B-ms98-a-0090 428.850375 430.393875 yeah
sw2168B-ms98-a-0091 430.393875 436.495875 well that's that's part of where my son is um would like to go to Rice but i don't think he's
sw2168B-ms98-a-0092 436.495875 441.780000 well the the difficulty is is is the people that get in are are are overachievers
sw2168B-ms98-a-0093 441.780000 451.764000 and he's not an overachiever but the same time everybody can't go but the question of of you know of of how far should you take a kid in the motivation i'm not sure
sw2168B-ms98-a-0094 451.764000 460.354250 i think maybe there's too much responsibility put on the teachers to motivate these kids i had a a friend that was administrator in Richardson and said if the parents read books
sw2168B-ms98-a-0095 460.354250 463.863875 then the kids probably would read books
sw2168B-ms98-a-0096 463.863875 471.049000 but that a lot of the schools i would think the kids you're talking to question of of how much reading do those kids' parents do
sw2168B-ms98-a-0097 471.049000 474.958875 [silence]
sw2168B-ms98-a-0098 474.958875 476.417625 well
sw2168B-ms98-a-0099 476.417625 483.266250 well but that's the point as i would say uh and that's that's what makes there's a lot of problems but 
sw2168B-ms98-a-0100 483.266250 486.105375 anyway um
sw2168B-ms98-a-0101 486.105375 492.569000 i'm trying to think how much longer i had a conversation week or so ago and we got carried away and they cut it beeps in at ten minutes so
sw2168B-ms98-a-0102 492.569000 495.158875 [laughter] so anyway
sw2168B-ms98-a-0103 495.158875 497.374625 [silence]
sw2168B-ms98-a-0104 497.374625 498.599250 yeah
sw2168B-ms98-a-0105 498.599250 511.262125 [silence]
sw2168B-ms98-a-0106 511.262125 512.296500 hm
sw2168B-ms98-a-0107 512.296500 518.781750 well see that's the thing in the Garland schools the numbers they i don't think they have to do that because most everybody passes
sw2168B-ms98-a-0108 518.781750 520.888500 [silence]
sw2168B-ms98-a-0109 520.888500 523.654125 well opportunity right
sw2168B-ms98-a-0110 523.654125 527.427875 [laughter-see] if you get graded on percent improvement
sw2168B-ms98-a-0111 527.427875 528.896250 but see that['s]-
sw2168B-ms98-a-0112 528.896250 530.205250 [silence]
sw2168B-ms98-a-0113 530.205250 531.374250 yeah
sw2168B-ms98-a-0114 531.374250 534.884250 and unfortunately the uh that's
sw2168B-ms98-a-0115 534.884250 539.256625 that's tough that's a real challenge though but uh
sw2168B-ms98-a-0116 539.256625 542.375750 [silence]
sw2168B-ms98-a-0117 542.375750 543.488750 yeah
sw2168B-ms98-a-0118 543.488750 554.926125 [silence]
sw2168B-ms98-a-0119 554.926125 556.183250 yeah
sw2168B-ms98-a-0120 556.183250 562.694375 [silence]
sw2168B-ms98-a-0121 562.694375 563.953125 yeah
sw2168B-ms98-a-0122 563.953125 570.354875 [silence]
sw2168B-ms98-a-0123 570.354875 571.410500 yeah
sw2168B-ms98-a-0124 571.410500 573.876500 [silence]
sw2168B-ms98-a-0125 573.876500 581.832750 well yeah you know our s[on]- son had that he wa[s]- has had uh attention deficit disorder and they were keeping him from recess and in reality that's uh
sw2168B-ms98-a-0126 581.832750 582.855500 [silence]
sw2168B-ms98-a-0127 582.855500 586.854500 that's one of those really tough situations i think the kids need some time to play
sw2168B-ms98-a-0128 586.854500 588.201750 but
sw2168B-ms98-a-0129 588.201750 593.650500 nevertheless goo[d]- if if people like if more people like you though that understand the problem get in and
sw2168B-ms98-a-0130 593.650500 596.559875 maybe we can change some education so
sw2168B-ms98-a-0131 596.559875 600.270750 uh i got some background noise there but i guess
