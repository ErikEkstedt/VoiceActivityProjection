sw2168A-ms98-a-0011 45.382500 47.657750 [silence]
sw2168A-ms98-a-0012 47.657750 49.513375 in the what
sw2168A-ms98-a-0013 49.513375 50.798875 [silence]
sw2168A-ms98-a-0014 50.798875 52.626625 well yeah yeah yeah
sw2168A-ms98-a-0015 52.626625 54.584500 [silence]
sw2168A-ms98-a-0016 54.584500 56.967125 no no they're still in elementary
sw2168A-ms98-a-0017 56.967125 58.159125 so yeah
sw2168A-ms98-a-0018 58.159125 63.057375 [silence]
sw2168A-ms98-a-0019 63.057375 64.521750 uh-huh
sw2168A-ms98-a-0020 64.521750 89.992125 [silence]
sw2168A-ms98-a-0021 89.992125 93.057875 i'm definitely not are you kidding
sw2168A-ms98-a-0022 93.057875 94.889500 [laughter] no
sw2168A-ms98-a-0023 94.889500 102.951750 [silence]
sw2168A-ms98-a-0024 102.951750 104.579250 no i want that
sw2168A-ms98-a-0025 104.579250 105.172625 [laughter]
sw2168A-ms98-a-0026 105.172625 111.004250 i think it would be better for the teachers and for the children because we would do away with so much of the burn out that we have
sw2168A-ms98-a-0027 111.004250 115.059250 i know when you get the kids that have gone the summer being out of school
sw2168A-ms98-a-0028 115.059250 122.504750 then it's like they've lost so much ground we spend at least the first six weeks just backing up reteaching what they had the year before
sw2168A-ms98-a-0029 122.504750 123.672750 you know
sw2168A-ms98-a-0030 123.672750 124.689000 [silence]
sw2168A-ms98-a-0031 124.689000 127.350000 well we're starting pilot schools
sw2168A-ms98-a-0032 127.350000 135.747750 it's a Dallas is doing it i know i think Plano don't they have some and Richardson's supposed to start some pilot schools going to school year around
sw2168A-ms98-a-0033 135.747750 143.334625 and then we you know we investigated this by flying some people out from Dallas to observe some of the schools in California that already had it
sw2168A-ms98-a-0034 143.334625 150.792000 yeah it seems to and one thing it'll save us money because we've got the buildings sitting there right and we might as well use them
sw2168A-ms98-a-0035 150.792000 157.071125 [silence]
sw2168A-ms98-a-0036 157.071125 160.978625 well air conditioning what's and and heating
sw2168A-ms98-a-0037 160.978625 171.294250 isn't air conditioning less than heating because we have to just up like if we get in the thirties we raise it up to the seventies right that's forty degrees
sw2168A-ms98-a-0038 171.294250 173.383375 isn't it less
sw2168A-ms98-a-0039 173.383375 175.096750 [silence]
sw2168A-ms98-a-0040 175.096750 180.961625 and it's not going to be like the kids are going to go a lot longer really if you go year around
sw2168A-ms98-a-0041 180.961625 182.775625 there's not thirty days difference
sw2168A-ms98-a-0042 182.775625 187.392375 [silence]
sw2168A-ms98-a-0043 187.392375 190.143750 there's different ways to do it
sw2168A-ms98-a-0044 190.143750 195.956750 like i i think going two six weeks and then having two two weeks off
sw2168A-ms98-a-0045 195.956750 200.230500 each after a two w[eeks]- six weeks period is one way
sw2168A-ms98-a-0046 200.230500 203.853750 [silence]
sw2168A-ms98-a-0047 203.853750 206.704125 see i don't know because i've never seen it in action
sw2168A-ms98-a-0048 206.704125 208.130000 [silence]
sw2168A-ms98-a-0049 208.130000 213.314375 well no the school system in Dallas has sent people there to do that no
sw2168A-ms98-a-0050 213.314375 214.325875 [silence]
sw2168A-ms98-a-0051 214.325875 218.385750 but i think i'd like it and i know a lot of teachers that would like to try it
sw2168A-ms98-a-0052 218.385750 231.072750 [silence]
sw2168A-ms98-a-0053 231.072750 235.525125 the principal's their t[ied]- hands are tied by all the administrators and i heard
sw2168A-ms98-a-0054 235.525125 242.041875 that in Dallas it's one out of every three is actually in the classroom of the educators that were hired
sw2168A-ms98-a-0055 242.041875 243.009375 [laughter]
sw2168A-ms98-a-0056 243.009375 247.070375 and that's just it's just you don't even know who all your bosses are it's ridiculous
sw2168A-ms98-a-0057 247.070375 255.457250 [silence]
sw2168A-ms98-a-0058 255.457250 257.072250 Marvin Edwards
sw2168A-ms98-a-0059 257.072250 272.229500 [silence]
sw2168A-ms98-a-0060 272.229500 279.269375 well you know he did [noise] supposedly cut administrators but what they've done is create other offices for those same people
sw2168A-ms98-a-0061 279.269375 282.361250 and just rehi[red]- renamed their jobs
sw2168A-ms98-a-0062 282.361250 283.442375 [silence]
sw2168A-ms98-a-0063 283.442375 291.390500 and you know opened up -[a]nother -[a]nother things one thing we've got going is called reading and initiative and they've hired all these administrators in on that you know
sw2168A-ms98-a-0064 291.390500 299.581000 [silence]
sw2168A-ms98-a-0065 299.581000 302.709875 pass or no fail uh what is it
sw2168A-ms98-a-0066 302.709875 304.293125 no play
sw2168A-ms98-a-0067 304.293125 305.705375 no play
sw2168A-ms98-a-0068 305.705375 308.439375 [silence]
sw2168A-ms98-a-0069 308.439375 311.286625 Carter High School yeah
sw2168A-ms98-a-0070 311.286625 320.113625 [silence]
sw2168A-ms98-a-0071 320.113625 325.097375 and all the things that Dallas fights costs thousands probably millions of dollars i bet you
sw2168A-ms98-a-0072 325.097375 328.073750 [silence]
sw2168A-ms98-a-0073 328.073750 329.900000 yeah i know
sw2168A-ms98-a-0074 329.900000 333.979500 and psychologists [laughter] [laughter-and] [laughter-stuff] that's right
sw2168A-ms98-a-0075 333.979500 341.944250 [silence]
sw2168A-ms98-a-0076 341.944250 343.977625 no we do not
sw2168A-ms98-a-0077 343.977625 345.758125 no [laughter]
sw2168A-ms98-a-0078 345.758125 348.706500 [silence]
sw2168A-ms98-a-0079 348.706500 355.789500 we need more of the tax money to actually get down to the students because_1 i[t's]- it's pretty frustrating when you see you don't even have paper and you're [laughter-trying] [laughter-to] [laughter-ration] [laughter-it]
sw2168A-ms98-a-0080 355.789500 363.855500 you know now that's sad when there's supposed to be what [vocalized-noise] you know one thousand what sixty five dollars something like that spent on each pupil
sw2168A-ms98-a-0081 363.855500 365.569625 [silence]
sw2168A-ms98-a-0082 365.569625 369.580875 um [noise] it's it's wrong anyway i was thinking about [noise]
sw2168A-ms98-a-0083 369.580875 383.841125 one thing that's wrong with schools is that we're not teaching to the children's modalities and i think in nineteen uh ninety three we're supposed to begin that if if a child is a visual learner we're supposed to present him with all these visual things and if he has to learn just by kinesthetic
sw2168A-ms98-a-0084 383.841125 392.842250 we're supposed to teach whatever way that that child has to have it learns the best way and that's going to be quite a [laughter-problem]
sw2168A-ms98-a-0085 392.842250 396.939375 but if we could do [laughter-something] like that i'm sure it would certainly help
sw2168A-ms98-a-0086 396.939375 400.010375 [silence]
sw2168A-ms98-a-0087 400.010375 404.454750 [laughter] i don't know no telling i don't know
sw2168A-ms98-a-0088 404.454750 412.058000 and you know at non graded schools they've had one in Gladewater for years and years and years if we could just let these kids go at their own rate
sw2168A-ms98-a-0089 412.058000 420.455250 i have children even i i teach Chapter one and it's for kids that have fallen behind in their reading according to like ITBS scores
sw2168A-ms98-a-0090 420.455250 429.607125 and some of the kids really they shouldn't be in there and they're you know they're not being challenged and they're not being challenged in their home and we always have to teach toward the middle of the road
sw2168A-ms98-a-0091 429.607125 441.190000 [silence]
sw2168A-ms98-a-0092 441.190000 442.567375 um-hum

sw2168A-ms98-a-0096 471.886625 477.330375 my children's parents aren't even there at night most of the time to do anything with them
sw2168A-ms98-a-0097 477.330375 478.736000 [laughter]
sw2168A-ms98-a-0098 478.736000 479.874125 yeah

sw2168A-ms98-a-0101 493.950750 498.447750 i went for a couple and i didn't know that there there was even a cut off or anything
sw2168A-ms98-a-0102 498.447750 501.660750 oh another things that's wrong with schools this is big [laughter]
sw2168A-ms98-a-0103 501.660750 503.627750 there's too much emphasis on test
sw2168A-ms98-a-0104 503.627750 512.030000 we're spending the first hour of everyday teaching for the [vocalized-noise] test at my school and we're going to do that until at least the first part of May
sw2168A-ms98-a-0105 512.030000 518.427625 [silence]
sw2168A-ms98-a-0106 518.427625 519.452250 [laughter]
sw2168A-ms98-a-0107 519.452250 521.300125 but see they're not in Dallas
sw2168A-ms98-a-0108 521.300125 523.450000 [silence]
sw2168A-ms98-a-0109 523.450000 524.477000 it's
sw2168A-ms98-a-0110 524.477000 527.470875 [silence]
sw2168A-ms98-a-0111 527.470875 532.234375 yeah we're not working with the same type of students that most of these kids in Garland are
sw2168A-ms98-a-0112 532.234375 538.065250 [silence]
sw2168A-ms98-a-0113 538.065250 545.018750 but see what we're doing is we're turning these kids off to school even more than they are and we're not teaching toward the test we're teaching
sw2168A-ms98-a-0114 545.018750 551.813625 you know always objectives you know it's like there's not a whole lot of you know fun time like we used to have in school
sw2168A-ms98-a-0115 551.813625 555.610375 like our principal says i want every child to be on task all the time
sw2168A-ms98-a-0116 555.610375 558.089750 and you can't do that as adults
sw2168A-ms98-a-0117 558.089750 560.069875 but we're expecting kids to
sw2168A-ms98-a-0118 560.069875 562.860375 and like after after recess play
sw2168A-ms98-a-0119 562.860375 571.191000 we don't get that [laughter-okay] if they finish before their thirty minutes is up then they can go out and play for like maybe five or ten minutes probably be the most
sw2168A-ms98-a-0120 571.191000 573.619375 but we always got that didn't you
sw2168A-ms98-a-0121 573.619375 578.608750 [silence]
