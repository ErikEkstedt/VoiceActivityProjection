sw2104A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 10.616500 okay i think we're supposed to discuss our view of the Soviet Union as a continuing [vocalized-noise] threat to the United States how do you feel about that
sw2104A-ms98-a-0002 10.616500 43.437875 [silence]
sw2104A-ms98-a-0003 43.437875 50.473500 i'm concerned about them_1 not as a military threat but as a burden
sw2104A-ms98-a-0004 50.473500 53.125625 they're very large
sw2104A-ms98-a-0005 53.125625 62.826500 and they could become very quickly a large financial burden as as one more stepchild we have to carry around
sw2104A-ms98-a-0006 62.826500 109.447125 [silence]
sw2104A-ms98-a-0007 109.447125 115.863125 and they have a a problem their their whole attitude um
sw2104A-ms98-a-0008 115.863125 124.118375 i i'm not sure which crop it was but they had a crop that rotted in the fields because they couldn't get anyone to harvest it
sw2104A-ms98-a-0009 124.118375 130.774000 and the people in the city were saying well why should i go do that make the government do that that's not my job
sw2104A-ms98-a-0010 130.774000 164.818000 [silence]
sw2104A-ms98-a-0011 164.818000 166.768250 absolutely
sw2104A-ms98-a-0012 166.768250 175.697500 and and i think that they're having a hard time with the concept of you cannot go back people only go forward
sw2104A-ms98-a-0013 175.697500 186.036500 and i think that that is giving them i'm expecting a call and unfortunately i think it's come through i've enjoyed talking to you thank you bye
