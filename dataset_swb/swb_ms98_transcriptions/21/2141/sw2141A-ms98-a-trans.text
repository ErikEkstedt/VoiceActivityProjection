sw2141A-ms98-a-0012 23.101625 28.472000 uh well it was it was entertaining it was funny Steve Martin did a pretty good job
sw2141A-ms98-a-0013 28.472000 31.617500 uh it's uh they portray the LA lifestyle
sw2141A-ms98-a-0014 31.617500 37.930000 and it's uh quite a lot uh crazier in the movie than it is in actuality i've been to Los Angeles before
sw2141A-ms98-a-0015 37.930000 42.637125 and nothing's as crazy as what they how they uh uh describe it in the movie [laughter]
sw2141A-ms98-a-0016 42.637125 46.464125 [silence]
sw2141A-ms98-a-0017 46.464125 52.423750 it's kind of fun if you've been there before y[ou'll]- you'll be able to relate to uh to the humor that they have in the movie

sw2141A-ms98-a-0021 56.116000 64.301625 i thought it was interesting how they cast that movie with uh Victoria Tennant as his uh love interest in the movie because she is his wife in reality
sw2141A-ms98-a-0022 64.301625 67.053375 [silence]
sw2141A-ms98-a-0023 67.053375 69.112625 so that added something to the movie

sw2141A-ms98-a-0087 295.748500 298.491750 that's i thought that was an outstanding film
sw2141A-ms98-a-0088 298.491750 299.661000 with
sw2141A-ms98-a-0089 299.661000 301.438625 with Richard Harris
sw2141A-ms98-a-0090 301.438625 308.795625 uh he plays a uh kind of a patriarch in uh Ireland nineteen twenties Ireland
sw2141A-ms98-a-0091 308.795625 313.887500 and uh it's about a uh piece of land that he rents
sw2141A-ms98-a-0092 313.887500 320.232500 uh he works uh a piece of land and rents it from uh an old English uh widow
sw2141A-ms98-a-0093 320.232500 321.545375 but uh he
sw2141A-ms98-a-0094 321.545375 329.055875 he has an obsession with this piece of land that he wants to own it and won't allow anyone else to uh to uh control that land
sw2141A-ms98-a-0095 329.055875 331.983375 and when the widow puts it up for uh for sale uh
sw2141A-ms98-a-0096 331.983375 337.405750 he claims that it's his even though he cannot afford uh the p[rice]- the price
sw2141A-ms98-a-0097 337.405750 342.987500 it uh goes to an Am[erican]- American uh who has uh ancestors from from the area
sw2141A-ms98-a-0098 342.987500 344.792875 he's trying to uh
sw2141A-ms98-a-0099 344.792875 348.080625 apparently trying to uh uh
sw2141A-ms98-a-0100 348.080625 355.889375 gain some background on his his heritage from uh Ireland so he's buying this piece of land to try to introduce civilization to the area
sw2141A-ms98-a-0101 355.889375 358.646875 and uh there are just a lot of uh interesting
sw2141A-ms98-a-0102 358.646875 366.598625 [noise]

sw2141A-ms98-a-0115 421.416750 423.980000 departure from what she's done before
sw2141A-ms98-a-0116 423.980000 429.102000 [silence]

sw2141A-ms98-a-0150 563.450000 570.480625 and i thought that was a very good film and Fatal Attraction was on the same theme almost identical
sw2141A-ms98-a-0151 570.480625 573.414625 but uh i didn't care for Fatal Attraction as much
