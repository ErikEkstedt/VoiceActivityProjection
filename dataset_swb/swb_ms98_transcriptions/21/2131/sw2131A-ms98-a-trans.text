sw2131A-ms98-a-0119 407.891000 412.382250 Smiley Burnette i don't know if you're old enough to remember him
sw2131A-ms98-a-0120 412.382250 423.723625 he was uh played in the old western movies he was the sidekick of Gene Autry i believe or they i think his name when in the movie was Froggy
sw2131A-ms98-a-0121 423.723625 427.497125 had had a real raspy voice
sw2131A-ms98-a-0122 427.497125 436.235875 and uh some of those old ones of course Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys and Ernest Tubbs and
sw2131A-ms98-a-0123 436.235875 438.475625 Red Foley and
sw2131A-ms98-a-0124 438.475625 440.249625 [silence]

sw2131A-ms98-a-0126 447.154875 449.213000 but uh
sw2131A-ms98-a-0127 449.213000 461.040500 my m[other]- mother and dad used to own a restaurant and they had a they had a uh nickelodeon of course in the restaurant and when they would come and change the records
sw2131A-ms98-a-0128 461.040500 464.741625 the guys would and the guy would give her the old records

sw2131A-ms98-a-0130 465.909875 467.179625 so uh
sw2131A-ms98-a-0131 467.179625 469.253625 that's where i learned about
sw2131A-ms98-a-0132 469.253625 474.854250 yeah course there's not a whole lot of market for seventy eight RPM records
sw2131A-ms98-a-0133 474.854250 475.907750 [silence]
sw2131A-ms98-a-0134 475.907750 486.415000 well the problem is that most of the record players now will not play them because you have to have that needle that uh particular kind of needle
sw2131A-ms98-a-0135 486.415000 489.631000 and uh they just won't play on a
sw2131A-ms98-a-0136 489.631000 492.318375 modern day uh
