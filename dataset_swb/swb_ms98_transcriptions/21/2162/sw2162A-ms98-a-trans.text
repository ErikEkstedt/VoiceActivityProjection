sw2162A-ms98-a-0061 210.958250 212.892250 uh well
sw2162A-ms98-a-0062 212.892250 219.186375 we are lucky enough to now be on a cable system that has four public TV channels
sw2162A-ms98-a-0063 219.186375 220.931000 [laughter-so] [laughter-we] [laughter-get]
sw2162A-ms98-a-0064 220.931000 230.452375 [laughter-we] [laughter-get] [laughter-things] over and over so if we miss them_1 we can catch them_1 later and that Gardens of the Worlds was absolutely glorious it was
sw2162A-ms98-a-0065 230.452375 233.291125 uh Audrey Hepburn was narrating it
sw2162A-ms98-a-0066 233.291125 236.828500 and they took you all over uh
sw2162A-ms98-a-0067 236.828500 247.521875 started in Italy went to England France some in America uh also Japan anyway it was a really a a visual treat
sw2162A-ms98-a-0068 247.521875 254.612625 [silence]
sw2162A-ms98-a-0069 254.612625 256.143375 is that right
sw2162A-ms98-a-0070 256.143375 258.262000 uh well uh
sw2162A-ms98-a-0071 258.262000 263.514250 when i was in Houston there was one station of just uh
sw2162A-ms98-a-0072 263.514250 266.476625 it was uh the University of Houston station
sw2162A-ms98-a-0073 266.476625 276.112375 [noise] and uh so it had not all of the stuff that people in other parts of the country were getting because_1 [vocalized-noise] each station gets its own mix
sw2162A-ms98-a-0074 276.112375 281.106250 but when i moved to California and all of a sudden i had this uh
sw2162A-ms98-a-0075 281.106250 284.112000 surfeit [laughter-of] [laughter-public] [laughter-television]
sw2162A-ms98-a-0076 284.112000 293.468250 [laughter-we] [laughter-can] get all sorts of things everything from i guess on Saturday there you can watch something like eight different cooking shows
sw2162A-ms98-a-0077 293.468250 297.545625 so i don't but i could if i felt like it
sw2162A-ms98-a-0078 297.545625 307.908750 [silence]
sw2162A-ms98-a-0079 307.908750 309.305875 um-hum

sw2162A-ms98-a-0081 317.836250 320.949500 really i would have thought that was close enough that
sw2162A-ms98-a-0082 320.949500 324.342250 [silence]
sw2162A-ms98-a-0083 324.342250 327.616125 or you got a hill between you or something like that
sw2162A-ms98-a-0084 327.616125 333.065250 [silence]
sw2162A-ms98-a-0085 333.065250 347.124625 well the onl[y]- about the only things i watch on commercial television are Thirty Something and Twin Peaks uh and i just discovered that they uh have have canceled [laughter-both] [laughter-of] [laughter-those] [laughter-so]
sw2162A-ms98-a-0086 347.124625 348.155500 [silence]
sw2162A-ms98-a-0087 348.155500 357.860000 well let me tell you that Twin Peaks was much better when it just started so maybe it's time for it to quit i they've gone downhill too
sw2162A-ms98-a-0088 357.860000 363.263375 [silence]
sw2162A-ms98-a-0089 363.263375 370.764875 well the thing i liked about it was that it was so unconventional that you couldn't predict what was coming next
sw2162A-ms98-a-0090 370.764875 374.433250 [silence]
sw2162A-ms98-a-0091 374.433250 385.510000 that's right and this one had all sorts of weird little things and would go off in uh strange directions and it had lots of
sw2162A-ms98-a-0092 385.510000 393.108125 uh little subtle touches that if you weren't watching you would miss uh that
sw2162A-ms98-a-0093 393.108125 405.900000 they'd have references to literature and things like that and they'd also just have odd thing they walk into a bank vault and there is a deer head lying on the [laughter-table] [laughter-in] [laughter-the] [laughter-bank] [laughter-vault]
sw2162A-ms98-a-0094 405.900000 417.125125 [laughter-and] [laughter-there's] no explanation for it they treat it as perfectly normal and somebody says what's the deer head doing here and they said oh it fell off the wall [laughter-so] [laughter-why] [laughter-was] [laughter-it] [laughter-doing] [laughter-on] [laughter-the] [laughter-wall]
sw2162A-ms98-a-0095 417.125125 424.824125 and in one case the fellow was making coffee and they said there's a fish in the [laughter-coffee] [laughter-pot]
sw2162A-ms98-a-0096 424.824125 426.046500 [laughter-well]
sw2162A-ms98-a-0097 426.046500 436.467375 i suspect that that's a reference to Thoreau's Fish in the Bucket of Milk but i don't know for sure and i'm not sure what the relevance would be if it were but
sw2162A-ms98-a-0098 436.467375 437.561500 [silence]
sw2162A-ms98-a-0099 437.561500 439.130250 anyway
sw2162A-ms98-a-0100 439.130250 447.190000 it had a lot of things like that thing to make you keep watching just for the novelty and the surprise of it

sw2162A-ms98-a-0110 465.128750 473.715875 yeah i'd say probably what i watch the most faithfully is the news which i really don't watch as much as i just listen to it
sw2162A-ms98-a-0111 473.715875 481.513250 [silence]
sw2162A-ms98-a-0112 481.513250 490.235000 when i'm fixing dinner or something like that it's i uh at least know if there's anything i want to read thoroughly in the newspaper
sw2162A-ms98-a-0113 490.235000 490.830625 [laughter]
sw2162A-ms98-a-0114 490.830625 493.089125 i get the headlines off the television
sw2162A-ms98-a-0115 493.089125 503.497750 [silence]
sw2162A-ms98-a-0116 503.497750 504.816875 yeah

sw2162A-ms98-a-0120 512.095250 519.520375 uh we just about had to get it because the reception in our particular locality was so poor
sw2162A-ms98-a-0121 519.520375 527.629000 that we could only get about three stations and uh only one was a public station and we had a
sw2162A-ms98-a-0122 527.629000 533.420625 San Francisco station and a San Jose station but neither one of them_1 was very clear they were both
sw2162A-ms98-a-0123 533.420625 535.409875 barely adequate
sw2162A-ms98-a-0124 535.409875 543.614000 so we decided when the cable came through that we would get on it just so we could see what we were watching if we watched anything at all
sw2162A-ms98-a-0125 543.614000 555.352375 [silence]
sw2162A-ms98-a-0126 555.352375 562.553125 um-hum yeah i think i would be inclined to do the same thing if we could see anything [laughter-without] [laughter-the] [laughter-cable]

sw2162A-ms98-a-0134 585.650125 599.689000 really well researched uh locations and sets and costumes and so forth and as far as i can tell on places where i have some knowledge their historical research is excellent
