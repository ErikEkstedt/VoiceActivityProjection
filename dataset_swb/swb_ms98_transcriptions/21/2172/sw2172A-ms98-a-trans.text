sw2172A-ms98-a-0060 214.974000 217.012125 i'm not really tempted to do that either
sw2172A-ms98-a-0061 217.012125 218.092875 if
sw2172A-ms98-a-0062 218.092875 223.734250 yeah i can mow the backyard but there's something about the grass in our front yard is so dense
sw2172A-ms98-a-0063 223.734250 227.818750 that the mower wheels just kind of bog down in there and i can not push it

sw2172A-ms98-a-0072 241.763875 243.391500 that might make it easier

sw2172A-ms98-a-0074 245.102750 251.751000 yeah ours is not that big but like i said if i had to mow the front i'd be stuck because i can't get it to move [laughter]

sw2172A-ms98-a-0087 298.581750 303.832750 wasn't a source of pride or something like it is down here

sw2172A-ms98-a-0095 326.649000 330.760875 yeah it's hard i know we tried to do our landscaping out front my husband
sw2172A-ms98-a-0096 330.760875 338.188625 tilled it up in the fall and then we've been waiting on some guy supposed to be getting us some edging for like ten cents a foot instead of about a dollar
sw2172A-ms98-a-0097 338.188625 345.706250 and uh he has never got it to us so it just sits out there kind of dug up and doesn't look too good so i can't say anything about anybody else's [laughter]

sw2172A-ms98-a-0100 350.747000 356.279375 it'd seem like they'd want to just to uh get some shade and keep their houses a little bit cooler in the summer
sw2172A-ms98-a-0101 356.279375 358.004875 [silence]

sw2172A-ms98-a-0106 367.463250 373.213625 we had two trees in the front of our yard and then one of them died and so we that's where we keep putting that pecan 
sw2172A-ms98-a-0107 373.213625 379.325250 keeps dying we have uh i think it's a Silver Leaf Maple or something like that that's hung on out there

sw2172A-ms98-a-0126 441.192250 448.098250 we've got all of our trees from Calloway's and luckily they'll take them_1 back any time for any reason if they die so
