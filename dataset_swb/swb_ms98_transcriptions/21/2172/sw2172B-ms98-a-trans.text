sw2172B-ms98-a-0015 61.294500 62.313625 um-hum
sw2172B-ms98-a-0016 62.313625 66.116500 yeah and i still need to assess the damage outside from the the freeze this winter

sw2172B-ms98-a-0026 97.900750 102.805000 yeah every year uh there's some freeze damage and i lose different uh variety of shrubs
sw2172B-ms98-a-0027 102.805000 105.984125 have to go replace them_1 with uh something a little hardier
sw2172B-ms98-a-0028 105.984125 108.930875 [silence]

sw2172B-ms98-a-0033 128.790875 133.104875 yeah i don't do much with flowers myself i just get a lot of ever[green]- evergreen type shrubs some uh
sw2172B-ms98-a-0034 133.104875 135.778625 some uh dwarf Burford hollies and Yaupon hollies

sw2172B-ms98-a-0036 138.326125 140.264750 they do very well um-hum

sw2172B-ms98-a-0038 147.442750 149.580500 yeah they make a nice hedge uh
sw2172B-ms98-a-0039 149.580500 155.588875 and the nice thing about those types of hollies is you don't have to trim them_1 uh into a boxy type hedge
sw2172B-ms98-a-0040 155.588875 158.844000 you can just let them uh grow their natural uh shape
sw2172B-ms98-a-0041 158.844000 164.395125 [silence]
sw2172B-ms98-a-0042 164.395125 168.904125 oh yeah oh i've got some Chinese Hollies that are just outrageous
sw2172B-ms98-a-0043 168.904125 170.190000 they they are very sharp
sw2172B-ms98-a-0044 170.190000 171.549625 [silence]
sw2172B-ms98-a-0045 171.549625 175.884625 do you do your own uh lawn maintenance or do you hire somebody to uh to do that
sw2172B-ms98-a-0046 175.884625 178.695375 [silence]
sw2172B-ms98-a-0047 178.695375 185.514500 yeah i do that myself too i- i too really don't appreciate them calling me up all the time to try to push their services on me 
sw2172B-ms98-a-0048 185.514500 187.661250 [silence]
sw2172B-ms98-a-0049 187.661250 192.299125 because i've got a very small yard the entire size of the lot is only forty five by ninety feet
sw2172B-ms98-a-0050 192.299125 199.128125 it's what they call low maintenance yard and these uh uh maintenance uh companies call up wanting to uh
sw2172B-ms98-a-0051 199.128125 208.174250 uh put put the uh weed killer and the fertilizer down and they want they want to charge forty or forty five dollars per application for my size yard i- i don't spend that much in a year
sw2172B-ms98-a-0052 208.174250 213.845625 [silence]
sw2172B-ms98-a-0053 213.845625 215.290625 uh-huh

sw2172B-ms98-a-0055 217.056125 218.902125 it doesn't take much work
sw2172B-ms98-a-0056 218.902125 220.196625 huh
sw2172B-ms98-a-0057 220.196625 223.445125 [silence]

sw2172B-ms98-a-0060 227.360250 232.185500 yeah i've got a little electric mower and i- i will never buy another one of those again
sw2172B-ms98-a-0061 232.185500 237.154375 it's fine for my size yard but uh it really doesn't have the power of a gas motor
sw2172B-ms98-a-0062 237.154375 240.340375 [silence]
sw2172B-ms98-a-0063 240.340375 241.578750 um-hum

sw2172B-ms98-a-0065 243.492625 245.574375 it's better for for a large yard
sw2172B-ms98-a-0066 245.574375 251.311500 [silence]
sw2172B-ms98-a-0067 251.311500 252.552250 yeah
sw2172B-ms98-a-0068 252.552250 261.350375 before i moved down here when i was up uh north in Wisconsin living with my folks they lived on uh three and a half acres of land and uh we started mowing that with a push mower
sw2172B-ms98-a-0069 261.350375 271.798625 uh they finally got smart and got a riding lawn mower which was a big improvement for for us [laughter] us kids who had to go out there and uh mow the the grass every every week
sw2172B-ms98-a-0070 271.798625 275.406875 it it still took a few hours even with the riding mower
sw2172B-ms98-a-0071 275.406875 280.297750 [silence]
sw2172B-ms98-a-0072 280.297750 283.331125 um not nearly as much as here
sw2172B-ms98-a-0073 283.331125 290.763125 uh i think it's probably because we lived out in the country somewhat and uh there just wasn't the emphasis on keeping the yards looking real nice
sw2172B-ms98-a-0074 290.763125 302.496125 [silence]
sw2172B-ms98-a-0075 302.496125 306.186125 yeah a lot of people do but then again there are a lot who do nothing
sw2172B-ms98-a-0076 306.186125 308.834000 my street uh is
sw2172B-ms98-a-0077 308.834000 315.133500 kind of in between there are a couple of uh neighbors who are are really good about planting flowers and trees
sw2172B-ms98-a-0078 315.133500 320.587750 but there the majority really haven't done anything with their yards this neighborhood is is four years old
sw2172B-ms98-a-0079 320.587750 326.470500 and you would think that uh in that time they'd uh get their lawns and and gardens established
sw2172B-ms98-a-0080 326.470500 341.938125 [silence]
sw2172B-ms98-a-0081 341.938125 343.460250 um-hum
sw2172B-ms98-a-0082 343.460250 345.738500 [silence]
sw2172B-ms98-a-0083 345.738500 351.080375 yeah i'd like to see the the neighbors put some trees in the front yards anyway just to get something started
sw2172B-ms98-a-0084 351.080375 354.175500 [silence]
sw2172B-ms98-a-0085 354.175500 355.339125 right
sw2172B-ms98-a-0086 355.339125 359.406000 you'd think that that would be the first thing they would do as far as the yard goes is to plant a tree
sw2172B-ms98-a-0087 359.406000 363.040625 it's nice when the builders plant trees for you when when they build the house
sw2172B-ms98-a-0088 363.040625 364.175500 [silence]
sw2172B-ms98-a-0089 364.175500 368.052625 no uh my builder was Gemcraft and they didn't put uh trees in at all
sw2172B-ms98-a-0090 368.052625 373.898250 [silence]
sw2172B-ms98-a-0091 373.898250 374.951500 yeah
sw2172B-ms98-a-0092 374.951500 377.972500 [silence]
sw2172B-ms98-a-0093 377.972500 383.626500 the trouble with with builders planting the trees is they they get the weaker varieties ones that aren't as desirable
sw2172B-ms98-a-0094 383.626500 388.429875 and uh those include Arizona Ash and in some cases silver maples
sw2172B-ms98-a-0095 388.429875 398.111750 [silence]
sw2172B-ms98-a-0096 398.111750 403.069625 yeah that's probably true i've got a live oak in front uh i- i really like the oaks a lot
sw2172B-ms98-a-0097 403.069625 404.315250 [silence]
sw2172B-ms98-a-0098 404.315250 406.516625 they're very hardy for this area
sw2172B-ms98-a-0099 406.516625 414.418125 [silence]
sw2172B-ms98-a-0100 414.418125 415.618500 um-hum
sw2172B-ms98-a-0101 415.618500 417.226500 [silence]
sw2172B-ms98-a-0102 417.226500 421.103750 oh i had a red oak a few years ago that i bought from uh
sw2172B-ms98-a-0103 421.103750 430.230375 from a guy who sold trees off the back of a trailer [laughter] and that was a mistake for uh well two reasons one thing it wasn't insured
sw2172B-ms98-a-0104 430.230375 439.745750 and the other reason was that i bought it in spring and it was a balled and bur lapped tree uh right before summer the heat of summer it couldn't uh take the heat and it died
sw2172B-ms98-a-0105 439.745750 446.715375 [silence]
sw2172B-ms98-a-0106 446.715375 449.633500 yeah i usually go to Callaway's or Wolfe
sw2172B-ms98-a-0107 449.633500 453.169750 Callaway's tends to have nicer shrubs uh more fully developed
sw2172B-ms98-a-0108 453.169750 461.981500 and uh i don't think there's a problem with the warranty on any of those places although they have cut back on their uh warranty for the shrubs the past couple of years
sw2172B-ms98-a-0109 461.981500 466.127250 [silence]
sw2172B-ms98-a-0110 466.127250 467.419125 yeah
sw2172B-ms98-a-0111 467.419125 469.125375 [silence]
sw2172B-ms98-a-0112 469.125375 472.741625 really well that's good for trees i don't think they do that for shrubs
sw2172B-ms98-a-0113 472.741625 477.000125 i think it's still a a year or less for uh for shrubs 
sw2172B-ms98-a-0114 477.000125 483.970000 [silence]
sw2172B-ms98-a-0115 483.970000 491.126625 oh it's never too late to plant something un[less]- unless well for trees if they're balled and bur lapped it's recommended to plant them in the fall or winter
sw2172B-ms98-a-0116 491.126625 495.991375 but for uh just shrubs say five gallon or one gallon shrubs any time of the year is fine
sw2172B-ms98-a-0117 495.991375 497.606500 [silence]
sw2172B-ms98-a-0118 497.606500 503.848500 right just have to take care of them_1 and water them_1 uh so they get established put some uh uh some uh
sw2172B-ms98-a-0119 503.848500 505.131000 uh
sw2172B-ms98-a-0120 505.131000 506.437000 [silence]
sw2172B-ms98-a-0121 506.437000 509.281500 right right some uh stimulator down
sw2172B-ms98-a-0122 509.281500 512.960875 so uh yeah it's never a problem to plant things in the summer
sw2172B-ms98-a-0123 512.960875 514.555375 [silence]
sw2172B-ms98-a-0124 514.555375 516.758000 i'm just waiting for a sale
sw2172B-ms98-a-0125 516.758000 519.962250 they haven't really had any good sales on plants yet
sw2172B-ms98-a-0126 519.962250 525.793750 [silence]
sw2172B-ms98-a-0127 525.793750 527.484250 so
sw2172B-ms98-a-0128 527.484250 536.977875 but once they uh drop the prices a little bit i'll be out there uh picking up a few more shrubs to fill in where we're [laughter] where my dead shrubs are right now i haven't even pulled them_1 out of the ground yet
sw2172B-ms98-a-0129 536.977875 546.198625 [silence]
sw2172B-ms98-a-0130 546.198625 548.674000 you have to watch the like the crepe myrtles
sw2172B-ms98-a-0131 548.674000 551.983000 because they'll look really bad like they're dead
sw2172B-ms98-a-0132 551.983000 553.753000 and all of a sudden they'll bud out
sw2172B-ms98-a-0133 553.753000 556.661500 i've got several crepe myrtles that look just awful
sw2172B-ms98-a-0134 556.661500 559.998125 and uh there are buds coming out all over the place now
sw2172B-ms98-a-0135 559.998125 561.918750 [silence]
sw2172B-ms98-a-0136 561.918750 568.357875 i have a crepe myrtle tree in the backyard that still hasn't done anything and i'm kind of wondering what kind of shape it's in right now
sw2172B-ms98-a-0137 568.357875 573.482875 have to make sure they don't get out of hand [laughter]
sw2172B-ms98-a-0138 573.482875 574.916625 they they can
sw2172B-ms98-a-0139 574.916625 576.886625 right they can get out of control 
sw2172B-ms98-a-0140 576.886625 580.592375 but mine keep dying back down to the ground so i haven't had that problem yet
sw2172B-ms98-a-0141 580.592375 584.057000 but i do have some really nice Boston ivy on the west side of the house
sw2172B-ms98-a-0142 584.057000 585.897875 [silence]
sw2172B-ms98-a-0143 585.897875 588.007375 grows on the on the brick
sw2172B-ms98-a-0144 588.007375 589.498125 on the house itself
sw2172B-ms98-a-0145 589.498125 596.681375 that you have to really watch uh to uh keep it under control because they will take over a house if you don't uh tend to it
sw2172B-ms98-a-0146 596.681375 598.873750 uh those things grow about an inch a day
