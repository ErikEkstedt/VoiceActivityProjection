sw2102A-ms98-a-0002 0.205875 6.163000 okay well my favorite probably all time TV show is Star Trek
sw2102A-ms98-a-0003 6.163000 9.563125 and i would [vocalized-noise] like that i i like the adventure of it
sw2102A-ms98-a-0004 9.563125 16.891875 and the idea that that we would survive long enough to get to that point and be able to do these fantastic things in space
sw2102A-ms98-a-0005 16.891875 27.519625 and then i like the they have a new one now the Star Trek the Next Generation which it's an all new cast but kind of the same idea going out to new places and and doing new things and
sw2102A-ms98-a-0006 27.519625 32.095875 finding out about different people and i've i've always liked that show probably the very best
sw2102A-ms98-a-0007 32.095875 42.830625 [silence]
sw2102A-ms98-a-0008 42.830625 44.206250 uh-huh
sw2102A-ms98-a-0009 44.206250 46.412750 [silence]
sw2102A-ms98-a-0010 46.412750 49.117875 yeah those the movies are good too
sw2102A-ms98-a-0011 49.117875 55.674125 and i i guess all the most the shows i like are are kind of along the same line because they're all [laughter-adventures] [laughter]
sw2102A-ms98-a-0012 55.674125 59.879625 when i when i started thinking about this that those are some of my favorite shows McGyver
sw2102A-ms98-a-0013 59.879625 72.973000 because it's it's only one person there more than uh you know instead of a cast of people but he's always going out and inventing new things out of scrap and grabbing what he can and you know pieces of baling wire and
sw2102A-ms98-a-0014 72.973000 77.031500 and a few tires and all of a sudden he's got a hang glider and [laughter]
sw2102A-ms98-a-0015 77.031500 78.150500 [silence]
sw2102A-ms98-a-0016 78.150500 79.626875 you haven't

sw2102A-ms98-a-0018 81.240375 82.375125 [silence]
sw2102A-ms98-a-0019 82.375125 90.697500 he's like a semi government type agent who goes out then to uh works for the Phoenix Foundation supposedly
sw2102A-ms98-a-0020 90.697500 94.512375 and uh h[is]- his big thing is that he can take pieces of
sw2102A-ms98-a-0021 94.512375 104.497125 little bits and pieces of string and baling wire and turn them into fantastic different things he took a car battery and some wire and two washers one time and made a welder
sw2102A-ms98-a-0022 104.497125 108.209500 so he [laughter] he [laughter-does] all kinds of strange things like that
sw2102A-ms98-a-0023 108.209500 110.869750 [silence]
sw2102A-ms98-a-0024 110.869750 112.541875 [laughter-yeah] [laughter]
sw2102A-ms98-a-0025 112.541875 120.107125 [laughter] see what we can come up with do you like the uh news shows Twenty Twenty an[d]- Sixty Minutes those kind of things
sw2102A-ms98-a-0026 120.107125 127.642375 [silence]
sw2102A-ms98-a-0027 127.642375 128.902875 uh-huh
sw2102A-ms98-a-0028 128.902875 132.853375 [silence]
sw2102A-ms98-a-0029 132.853375 135.753000 some of the little things yeah
sw2102A-ms98-a-0030 135.753000 136.292000 [laughter]
sw2102A-ms98-a-0031 136.292000 145.821625 [silence]
sw2102A-ms98-a-0032 145.821625 147.251125 uh
sw2102A-ms98-a-0033 147.251125 151.054125 [silence]
sw2102A-ms98-a-0034 151.054125 152.731250 oh
sw2102A-ms98-a-0035 152.731250 161.974750 i guess i haven't ever had any trouble with that i have more or less i have my favorite shows and i usually make time in my day or my week you know to watch those
sw2102A-ms98-a-0036 161.974750 166.781375 but for the most part i try i have small kids and i try and keep it on just
sw2102A-ms98-a-0037 166.781375 170.200000 a minimum amount of time really when they're up
sw2102A-ms98-a-0038 170.200000 176.227375 because they're i guess that that that falls in and one of my other favorite shows is Sesame Street because of the kids
sw2102A-ms98-a-0039 176.227375 178.089625 i like that real well
sw2102A-ms98-a-0040 178.089625 183.732375 [silence]
sw2102A-ms98-a-0041 183.732375 186.782000 uh-huh i don't think they have that on anymore
sw2102A-ms98-a-0042 186.782000 199.105625 i haven't seen the Electric Company in a long time i i remember it when i was younger of you know catching it on PBS but uh i don't think they show it must be in maybe it's in if it was in repeats but they're not making new ones
sw2102A-ms98-a-0043 199.105625 203.583625 i haven't seen it in a long time but Sesame Street is still really good
sw2102A-ms98-a-0044 203.583625 205.702250 [silence]
sw2102A-ms98-a-0045 205.702250 211.709000 yes yeah they still show Mister Rogers i don't think he's making new ones but they repeat all the old ones
sw2102A-ms98-a-0046 211.709000 219.081250 so that's still a real good show too i that one tends to come on earlier in the day than i want to turn the TV [laughter-on]
sw2102A-ms98-a-0047 219.081250 230.113500 Sesame Street comes on from like nine to ten which is a good time and everybody is up and had breakfast and dressed and ready to go so it's the timing of of it is good besides the am[ount]- what's on
sw2102A-ms98-a-0048 230.113500 231.883500 [silence]
sw2102A-ms98-a-0049 231.883500 234.050125 yes i have two little ones
sw2102A-ms98-a-0050 234.050125 236.000125 so they like that
sw2102A-ms98-a-0051 236.000125 239.359000 [silence]
sw2102A-ms98-a-0052 239.359000 244.646875 they come on both they come on like from nine to ten and then from uh five to six
sw2102A-ms98-a-0053 244.646875 246.195250 they just repeat
sw2102A-ms98-a-0054 246.195250 254.362125 over again which is also that's another thing [laughter-that's] [laughter] good about it when it comes on right in the dinner hour i f[eel]- can feel like i can let them sit in front of the TV and watch
sw2102A-ms98-a-0055 254.362125 260.191875 and they're watching something worthwhile while i can make dinner and do things i need to do without them under foot
sw2102A-ms98-a-0056 260.191875 265.632750 [silence]
sw2102A-ms98-a-0057 265.632750 267.001125 yeah [laughter]

sw2102A-ms98-a-0060 270.315500 271.244750 [silence]
sw2102A-ms98-a-0061 271.244750 277.542500 some shows are good for i think some shows some Star Trek i for the imagination of it all
sw2102A-ms98-a-0062 277.542500 290.046750 the idea i i think that's one of the things i like about Star Trek and is is the even in for kids watching it some of it can be a little violent sometimes and stuff i don't let my little ones watch it but the imagination of look what we can do
sw2102A-ms98-a-0063 290.046750 293.600500 you know in the future this is perhaps this will be possible
sw2102A-ms98-a-0064 293.600500 295.157750 that kind of thing
sw2102A-ms98-a-0065 295.157750 297.302250 [silence]

sw2102A-ms98-a-0074 327.014250 329.740000 that uh they always had a good plot
sw2102A-ms98-a-0075 329.740000 334.472875 it kind of kept you guessing on on uh what was going to happen next [laughter]
sw2102A-ms98-a-0076 334.472875 337.819250 how they're going get out of their latest scrape
