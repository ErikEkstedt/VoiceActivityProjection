sw2177B-ms98-a-0010 34.237375 40.218000 well yeah oh i heard a story about there's a there's a certain scene in the movie where there's um 
sw2177B-ms98-a-0011 40.218000 51.287125 where they're where they're on a buffalo hunt and they have a particular child actor uh who's who's being supposedly run down by a buffalo
sw2177B-ms98-a-0012 51.287125 63.184750 and when they were trying to film that the buffalo that they used for that scene was Neil Young's buffalo i can't remember what they said his name was but he has a fetish for Oreo cookies
sw2177B-ms98-a-0013 63.184750 70.599250 [laughter] and they got him to run like he was running down the kid by luring him with Oreo cookies

sw2177B-ms98-a-0024 114.889500 123.580625 yeah was the only thing about the costuming my husband remarked that it didn't that that um the Indians all appeared to be wearing new things
sw2177B-ms98-a-0025 123.580625 133.070625 and they should have taken them out and rolled them in the dirt a little more probably you know age to age the material so they they did very authentic reproductions of the
sw2177B-ms98-a-0026 133.070625 137.385875 of the actual stuff but they didn't they didn't age it
sw2177B-ms98-a-0027 137.385875 141.403625 quite enough it seemed but it was a very good movie

sw2177B-ms98-a-0055 237.696375 238.747125 [silence]

sw2177B-ms98-a-0059 250.465875 251.991875 i think [vocalized-noise]
sw2177B-ms98-a-0060 251.991875 263.287250 well now we had some friends that went to see it and they said it was okay so it might not be as i think they may be playing up um some aspects of the movie that aren't the main aspects
sw2177B-ms98-a-0061 263.287250 273.961125 now we went to see the Jagged Edge and that yeah so it's it seems like you know that kind of the thriller suspense and not not real um
sw2177B-ms98-a-0062 273.961125 276.123000 strange in other ways
sw2177B-ms98-a-0063 276.123000 280.720000 [silence]
