sw2164A-ms98-a-0002 11.833625 13.751250 in Rhode Island
sw2164A-ms98-a-0003 13.751250 18.246625 yeah i you know i'm not sure if we have the death penalty here
sw2164A-ms98-a-0004 18.246625 20.932000 to be perfectly honest with you hold on a second
sw2164A-ms98-a-0005 20.932000 25.419875 <b_aside> do we have the death penalty in Rhode Island no <e_aside> okay no we don't
sw2164A-ms98-a-0006 25.419875 27.692750 but you know um
sw2164A-ms98-a-0007 27.692750 31.116250 i- i have some feelings about it in the sense that
sw2164A-ms98-a-0008 31.116250 35.726000 i feel if a person is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt
sw2164A-ms98-a-0009 35.726000 38.225750 and it's a really heinous crime
sw2164A-ms98-a-0010 38.225750 41.385500 i feel like the Bible says an eye for an eye
sw2164A-ms98-a-0011 41.385500 45.565500 [silence]
sw2164A-ms98-a-0012 45.565500 50.992000 yeah you know something really a serial killer or
sw2164A-ms98-a-0013 50.992000 54.323250 you know someone who who really has no remorse
sw2164A-ms98-a-0014 54.323250 55.352125 [silence]
sw2164A-ms98-a-0015 55.352125 58.657750 you know that that just does these things uh
sw2164A-ms98-a-0016 58.657750 63.260250 i don't know without feeling guilty about it at all you know and the and their
sw2164A-ms98-a-0017 63.260250 69.512000 we in fact we have an example going on right now with this uh school teacher involved some teenagers
sw2164A-ms98-a-0018 69.512000 73.781000 into uh committing murder get getting rid of her husband
sw2164A-ms98-a-0019 73.781000 77.499750 i don't know if you're familiar with it Pamela Smart in New Hampshire
sw2164A-ms98-a-0020 77.499750 78.804750 [silence]
sw2164A-ms98-a-0021 78.804750 85.163625 see now in a situation like that the boys are only sixteen years old and they were sexually involved with her
sw2164A-ms98-a-0022 85.163625 89.873250 and i think like at that particular point she was twenty three
sw2164A-ms98-a-0023 89.873250 93.468125 you know so she wasn't really that much older than them
sw2164A-ms98-a-0024 93.468125 97.598875 and being a boy at that age i think that they're very
sw2164A-ms98-a-0025 97.598875 103.612500 um you know let's face it that's at a point in your life when you you're just starting to realize all the things of life
sw2164A-ms98-a-0026 103.612500 110.227125 i think she probably had a lot of influence on them and they probably would have never done something like that
sw2164A-ms98-a-0027 110.227125 113.878625 if it wasn't for the crime of passion type of thing
sw2164A-ms98-a-0028 113.878625 115.016125 an[d]-
sw2164A-ms98-a-0029 115.016125 118.581250 [silence]
sw2164A-ms98-a-0030 118.581250 119.934250 uh-huh
sw2164A-ms98-a-0031 119.934250 121.854125 [silence]
sw2164A-ms98-a-0032 121.854125 123.119500 yeah
sw2164A-ms98-a-0033 123.119500 124.195625 [silence]
sw2164A-ms98-a-0034 124.195625 128.677750 now see i agree with that i- i don't think a person should be electrocuted or
sw2164A-ms98-a-0035 128.677750 133.864750 hung or you know i[n]- in other words i believe that they should be punished and done away with
sw2164A-ms98-a-0036 133.864750 138.626000 on one hand like i say if they're if they're guilty beyond a reasonable doubt
sw2164A-ms98-a-0037 138.626000 140.032000 but if there's
sw2164A-ms98-a-0038 140.032000 146.504250 the the other the other hand where you say you know if there's just that slim chance that they didn't do it
sw2164A-ms98-a-0039 146.504250 150.219875 and then you know spend the time say life imprisonment
sw2164A-ms98-a-0040 150.219875 155.820750 then at least they have a chance to over the years be proven not guilty
sw2164A-ms98-a-0041 155.820750 156.874375 you know
sw2164A-ms98-a-0042 156.874375 166.487000 [silence]
sw2164A-ms98-a-0043 166.487000 167.806250 yeah

sw2164A-ms98-a-0045 173.845625 176.440875 oh that's the cheerleader thing
sw2164A-ms98-a-0046 176.440875 179.820750 oh yes that was on TV here
sw2164A-ms98-a-0047 179.820750 182.095750 it made national um
sw2164A-ms98-a-0048 182.095750 183.686125 [silence]
sw2164A-ms98-a-0049 183.686125 185.617250 yeah really
sw2164A-ms98-a-0050 185.617250 187.736750 [silence]
sw2164A-ms98-a-0051 187.736750 192.491875 but you know i- i- i saw i can't figure out what people are doing any more
sw2164A-ms98-a-0052 192.491875 194.590500 i mean it's getting so bad
sw2164A-ms98-a-0053 194.590500 203.523375 and i don't think unless that the cri[me]- that the laws get to the point where people are afraid to do something because they know they'll be punished
sw2164A-ms98-a-0054 203.523375 205.449875 you know what i'm saying
sw2164A-ms98-a-0055 205.449875 211.600875 [silence]
sw2164A-ms98-a-0056 211.600875 216.056875 yeah a[nd]- you know a[nd]- i- i don't know if it would be
sw2164A-ms98-a-0057 216.056875 219.527375 but i mean we don't know that it wouldn't either
sw2164A-ms98-a-0058 219.527375 224.250000 [silence]
sw2164A-ms98-a-0059 224.250000 225.402250 yeah
sw2164A-ms98-a-0060 225.402250 228.162000 [silence]
sw2164A-ms98-a-0061 228.162000 232.206125 and the other point someone made at one one time was that
sw2164A-ms98-a-0062 232.206125 238.270125 if someone is guilty of a terrible crime or they're a serial killer or mass murderer
sw2164A-ms98-a-0063 238.270125 245.266000 that if they're in prison that gives you the chance to um get into the person's mind
sw2164A-ms98-a-0064 245.266000 250.358875 to find out uh what led them to the point that they were at when they committed the crime
sw2164A-ms98-a-0065 250.358875 254.551500 to uh try to understand how their mind worked to prevent
sw2164A-ms98-a-0066 254.551500 258.468750 uh you know another person from getting into the same situation
sw2164A-ms98-a-0067 258.468750 264.370500 but i don't know you know [vocalized-noise] maybe you could do that for a certain period of time
sw2164A-ms98-a-0068 264.370500 267.800875 but i mean how long does that kind of a thing take
sw2164A-ms98-a-0069 267.800875 273.442250 you know to to um say to question the person or to get into their head
sw2164A-ms98-a-0070 273.442250 285.386625 you know even if it took five years i think that if at that time you you feel that they were guilty or that they were uh of sound mind where they knew what crimes they were committing i mean people know what they're doing
sw2164A-ms98-a-0071 285.386625 290.555000 you know that that i really do i believe that that capital punishment should be there
sw2164A-ms98-a-0072 290.555000 293.168875 the prisons are overcrowded
sw2164A-ms98-a-0073 293.168875 296.105250 it costs the taxpayers a lot of money
sw2164A-ms98-a-0074 296.105250 298.997625 [silence]
sw2164A-ms98-a-0075 298.997625 303.412375 yeah [vocalized-noise] i'll tell you in the state of Rhode Island it was so bad
sw2164A-ms98-a-0076 303.412375 311.223250 that the intake center that they have to house the the criminals before they go to the uh penitentiaries and stuff
sw2164A-ms98-a-0077 311.223250 317.672375 um were overcrowded and the judge fined the state thousands of dollars a day
sw2164A-ms98-a-0078 317.672375 320.615000 to build a bigger intake center
sw2164A-ms98-a-0079 320.615000 324.096875 so i mean it it's like where does this all stop
sw2164A-ms98-a-0080 324.096875 325.859875 [silence]
sw2164A-ms98-a-0081 325.859875 329.490125 exactly same thing here and that's that's what they did
sw2164A-ms98-a-0082 329.490125 333.026250 [silence]
sw2164A-ms98-a-0083 333.026250 334.050750 yep
sw2164A-ms98-a-0084 334.050750 339.550875 in fact the news tonight they had uh someone come on a seventy three year old man
sw2164A-ms98-a-0085 339.550875 347.302875 they they had gotten into a housing for the elderly and and the person who perpetrated the crime went in with someone who had a relative there
sw2164A-ms98-a-0086 347.302875 355.843625 and uh apparently this this person was on drugs and the old man was an invalid and he was in an elevator and he died for twelve dollars
sw2164A-ms98-a-0087 355.843625 368.379500 [silence]
sw2164A-ms98-a-0088 368.379500 369.517125 yep
sw2164A-ms98-a-0089 369.517125 373.467250 [silence]
sw2164A-ms98-a-0090 373.467250 379.399250 yeah and i also think that the uh fact that a lot of mothers are working today
sw2164A-ms98-a-0091 379.399250 382.490375 and that children are not bonded to the parents
sw2164A-ms98-a-0092 382.490375 388.106625 and other people take the responsibility for raising these kids or the children are left out
sw2164A-ms98-a-0093 388.106625 389.366625 you know
sw2164A-ms98-a-0094 389.366625 397.221875 on their own and they don't really feel the family um closeness that we had when oh when i was growing up
sw2164A-ms98-a-0095 397.221875 403.084500 my my mother didn't work you know [vocalized-noise] and when she did uh a part time job she was there
sw2164A-ms98-a-0096 403.084500 405.026375 you know it wasn't like she
sw2164A-ms98-a-0097 405.026375 407.205875 [silence]
sw2164A-ms98-a-0098 407.205875 409.564500 getting mothers back in the home
sw2164A-ms98-a-0099 409.564500 410.707750 [silence]
sw2164A-ms98-a-0100 410.707750 412.280125 you know kind of

sw2164A-ms98-a-0102 415.268125 417.950125 oh i know i know
sw2164A-ms98-a-0103 417.950125 419.726000 [silence]
sw2164A-ms98-a-0104 419.726000 423.926500 how do you feel about it do you do you think there should be capital punishment
sw2164A-ms98-a-0105 423.926500 437.674000 [silence]
sw2164A-ms98-a-0106 437.674000 446.963000 yeah i- i do myself i really think that it's it's all well and good to um be a do-gooder or to to um
sw2164A-ms98-a-0107 446.963000 452.710625 you know try to spare everyone's life but when someone has no regard for another person
sw2164A-ms98-a-0108 452.710625 455.529375 [noise] excuse me their property or their personal
sw2164A-ms98-a-0109 455.529375 460.140625 uh being or their families i mean you know when whole families are killed and
sw2164A-ms98-a-0110 460.140625 466.067125 and and yet you have someone who'll commit a crime of robbery and spend twenty five years in jail
sw2164A-ms98-a-0111 466.067125 470.982750 i mean to me it's like we have things messed up somehow
sw2164A-ms98-a-0112 470.982750 472.859000 y[ou]- you know what i mean
sw2164A-ms98-a-0113 472.859000 478.691375 and a[nd]- like this banking crisis thing where people have stolen millions of dollars and they're out walking around
sw2164A-ms98-a-0114 478.691375 480.590750 [silence]
sw2164A-ms98-a-0115 480.590750 483.749000 i think all our laws are are really screwed up
sw2164A-ms98-a-0116 483.749000 487.854500 i do i- i don't know what to do about it i wish i did
sw2164A-ms98-a-0117 487.854500 489.156500 but uh

sw2164A-ms98-a-0126 511.799875 513.284750 [silence]
sw2164A-ms98-a-0127 513.284750 516.555875 about these young children who
sw2164A-ms98-a-0128 516.555875 525.520000 we[re]- were not even like sixteen years old they were eleven and twelve and fourteen and fifteen year olds and they they actually committed murders
sw2164A-ms98-a-0129 525.520000 529.877875 and the question was whether to try them as adults or as children
sw2164A-ms98-a-0130 529.877875 537.358250 and whether or not to uh institute you know capital punishment where it was necessary and things like that
sw2164A-ms98-a-0131 537.358250 538.823375 that has to
sw2164A-ms98-a-0132 538.823375 543.448875 yeah i- i mean what would you do in a situation like that you say well he's only ten years old
sw2164A-ms98-a-0133 543.448875 547.107000 but the crime he committed is that of an adult
sw2164A-ms98-a-0134 547.107000 549.027250 he made that decision
sw2164A-ms98-a-0135 549.027250 567.746625 [silence]
sw2164A-ms98-a-0136 567.746625 569.300125 uh-huh

sw2164A-ms98-a-0139 576.927750 587.244750 imagine so see this is what i'm saying and even with uh people who are mentally incompetent you know uh like deranged
sw2164A-ms98-a-0140 587.244750 592.503125 it's so hard to get people even institutionalized because they're overcrowded
sw2164A-ms98-a-0141 592.503125 597.437125 so you have people walking the streets that are child molesters
sw2164A-ms98-a-0142 597.437125 599.448625 or uh
