sw2190A-ms98-a-0005 30.737500 33.770375 uh well there there's two things uh
sw2190A-ms98-a-0006 33.770375 37.436375 the one i'm interested the most i guess myself uh
sw2190A-ms98-a-0007 37.436375 45.874500 would be the the Freons i mean for air cond[itioning]- the one i guess that's the one i'm most curious about is how they're going to replace the Freons in air-conditioning
sw2190A-ms98-a-0008 45.874500 55.479375 that seemed to be the biggest surprise to me and whether when they replace it you know they're going to really come up with something that is not just as bad
sw2190A-ms98-a-0009 55.479375 62.788750 [silence]
sw2190A-ms98-a-0010 62.788750 67.737875 yeah yeah i uh was uh you know where they were all concerned about that but that that it seems to be

sw2190A-ms98-a-0032 168.879250 175.137750 i- i'll do that in a minute i- i think that the changing you know from leaded fuel was a tremendous advantage
sw2190A-ms98-a-0033 175.137750 176.874500 you know not not using
sw2190A-ms98-a-0034 176.874500 178.385125 no no no
sw2190A-ms98-a-0035 178.385125 179.825625 [silence]
sw2190A-ms98-a-0036 179.825625 183.418750 really oh i'm a car buff too we ought to work talk about that one day uh
sw2190A-ms98-a-0037 183.418750 184.567000 uh
sw2190A-ms98-a-0038 184.567000 185.611625 [silence]
sw2190A-ms98-a-0039 185.611625 191.898875 i think you can use the you can use high you know the ninety two percent uh ninety two octane i don't think you'll have any trouble
sw2190A-ms98-a-0040 191.898875 193.023875 [silence]
sw2190A-ms98-a-0041 193.023875 195.130250 oh yeah yeah

sw2190A-ms98-a-0043 200.355125 204.619000 i don't think that's a problem i thought i'm saying i was glad to get rid of leaded gasoline
sw2190A-ms98-a-0044 204.619000 206.311250 [silence]
sw2190A-ms98-a-0045 206.311250 214.965250 uh oh ye[ah]- i- the same thing about the war uh or related to the war on i was watching CNN and i cannot remember what station it was
sw2190A-ms98-a-0046 214.965250 217.983125 what did you see the advertisements uh
sw2190A-ms98-a-0047 217.983125 225.234375 when they talked about nuclear war what that would have been like in changing the atmosphere it is so scary that
sw2190A-ms98-a-0048 225.234375 231.306250 i hope that every one of the government officials saw that because it was just total disaster you know
sw2190A-ms98-a-0049 231.306250 233.945250 did you see any of those uh i it was
sw2190A-ms98-a-0050 233.945250 236.309250 [silence]
sw2190A-ms98-a-0051 236.309250 241.629250 it must have been channel thirteen i don't recall although i thought it was on CNN oh i

sw2190A-ms98-a-0053 246.027125 249.786250 it was a somewhat of a commercial because_1 it c[ame]- i saw it regularly
sw2190A-ms98-a-0054 249.786250 254.620000 and it showed that and it was really devastating and it would uh
sw2190A-ms98-a-0055 254.620000 260.780375 how much ash would fall and and how it would essentially literally destroy the world you know
sw2190A-ms98-a-0056 260.780375 292.468250 [silence]
sw2190A-ms98-a-0057 292.468250 296.457125 oh really yeah there there's probably a lot of natural things uh
sw2190A-ms98-a-0058 296.457125 300.011125 [silence]
sw2190A-ms98-a-0059 300.011125 301.427625 yeah

sw2190A-ms98-a-0061 302.501625 310.238375 uh it i guess it's got to be really i don't know i don't know if it's air pollution it's uh it's dust pollution whether it's natural or not i don't know
sw2190A-ms98-a-0062 310.238375 322.894875 [silence]
sw2190A-ms98-a-0063 322.894875 331.023500 yeah oh yeah well i live in Arlington and there there there are no buses i mean there there is the only school bus the only buses you see are school buses so
sw2190A-ms98-a-0064 331.023500 333.335625 [silence]
sw2190A-ms98-a-0065 333.335625 341.410875 well i know it it's uh you know the car is we have this big romance with the car but uh i think people are would be interested if you had one i mean
sw2190A-ms98-a-0066 341.410875 343.399250 [silence]
sw2190A-ms98-a-0067 343.399250 344.653875 yeah

sw2190A-ms98-a-0074 377.879875 380.925625 [silence]
sw2190A-ms98-a-0075 380.925625 389.616750 well you said you were car buff uh i think that uh all of us could use one electric car right now i mean today because i think uh
sw2190A-ms98-a-0076 389.616750 397.555625 you said people drive forty miles and fifty whatever yeah when you go to trips and all you can have one gasoline car but i think we all could in a family say
sw2190A-ms98-a-0077 397.555625 404.238750 have an electric car where my one of my daughters or my wife my wife she could use one now if they had one you know
sw2190A-ms98-a-0078 404.238750 408.508750 because they she don't even she doesn't put fifty miles a day on the car
sw2190A-ms98-a-0079 408.508750 413.888875 [silence]
sw2190A-ms98-a-0080 413.888875 417.967750 no no you're right i- i have seen them but uh they have a battery car
sw2190A-ms98-a-0081 417.967750 423.334750 uh i went to the auto show this past week and they did not endorse now that i think of it
sw2190A-ms98-a-0082 423.334750 430.589000 and i was so interested in the auto show i didn't think to ask anybody there were no electric cars i was surprised but now that you just mentioned that
sw2190A-ms98-a-0083 430.589000 435.735750 [silence]
sw2190A-ms98-a-0084 435.735750 441.445000 yeah i- i think uh there could be a lot of peo[ple]- i thi[nk]- people close this is really we're
sw2190A-ms98-a-0085 441.445000 445.956250 were nine years away or less i guess from the next century and i think
sw2190A-ms98-a-0086 445.956250 454.949750 [silence]
sw2190A-ms98-a-0087 454.949750 461.696500 yeah they've got a they've got a area over in the SE building too which is uh but it's a solar
sw2190A-ms98-a-0088 461.696500 472.508375 uh it's for uh they g[ot]- got some money from a power company and it's probably more generating power for you know uh electricity a hundred and twenty volt or whatever
sw2190A-ms98-a-0089 472.508375 473.490875 [silence]
sw2190A-ms98-a-0090 473.490875 475.499000 no i'm actually in the south building but uh
sw2190A-ms98-a-0091 475.499000 479.436375 i was uh i'm the facility so i've been in all most of the buildings anyway
sw2190A-ms98-a-0092 479.436375 481.131625 [silence]
sw2190A-ms98-a-0093 481.131625 484.021625 oh yeah well the the solar area is right
sw2190A-ms98-a-0094 484.021625 486.912125 right around from the auditorium now
sw2190A-ms98-a-0095 486.912125 491.412000 and they they've got several different uh areas where they're called solar lab
sw2190A-ms98-a-0096 491.412000 494.058500 it's right there on the first floor you ought to walk by there
sw2190A-ms98-a-0097 494.058500 498.917750 [silence]
sw2190A-ms98-a-0098 498.917750 506.369875 yeah but the solar project you know TI's been into it for years and i guess it's just not uh economical yet because of the other fuels
sw2190A-ms98-a-0099 506.369875 515.144250 [silence]
sw2190A-ms98-a-0100 515.144250 516.802375 yeah
sw2190A-ms98-a-0101 516.802375 521.905125 i've seen some i think then again i'm surprised now i didn't think they'd asked anybody when i was in the auto show
sw2190A-ms98-a-0102 521.905125 526.198125 there was nothing uh and there was no [vocalized-noise] place for
sw2190A-ms98-a-0103 526.198125 530.620375 air pollution or companies or anyone there it was just pure automobiles
sw2190A-ms98-a-0104 530.620375 532.608875 [silence]
sw2190A-ms98-a-0105 532.608875 533.996125 there

sw2190A-ms98-a-0109 537.070125 539.012250 i didn't see did you go
sw2190A-ms98-a-0110 539.012250 540.296375 oh
sw2190A-ms98-a-0111 540.296375 547.928125 i- i was uh quite impressed with all the cars you know the engines are so much smaller now and everything and they're they all have brand new engines even General Motors uh
sw2190A-ms98-a-0112 547.928125 556.082000 very few only the Caprice and them and the Cadillac had eight uh the old V8s they're all brand new engines uh of course they're burning gasoline of course
sw2190A-ms98-a-0113 556.082000 558.788125 now and uh
sw2190A-ms98-a-0114 558.788125 562.909500 whether you know that's one way you know uh
sw2190A-ms98-a-0115 562.909500 570.241750 uh f[or]- on air pollution i- i- i don't know if the automobiles are are the biggest contributor or not really they've got catalytic converters everyone seem to have
sw2190A-ms98-a-0116 570.241750 575.126375 gone to that whether they last uh and do a good job and now that they
sw2190A-ms98-a-0117 575.126375 583.486250 the inspection systems are analyzing that uh well what do you think if you're in that you know if you're concerned about that i mean if you're you're you're knowledgeable on that
sw2190A-ms98-a-0118 583.486250 599.275375 [silence]
