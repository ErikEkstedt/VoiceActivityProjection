sw2190B-ms98-a-0002 3.808500 9.522750 oh well i'm not an expert i just had a little i've i've seen a little pollution in my time it's uh
sw2190B-ms98-a-0003 9.522750 18.702125 the the the chemicals we were dealing with were uh a [vocalized-noise] repellent and uh that was really quite dangerous i'm not certain that that was
sw2190B-ms98-a-0004 18.702125 23.934750 that's that's really a pollution issue i think pollution issue is is uh
sw2190B-ms98-a-0005 23.934750 30.855875 is is the argument over over people catching uh things like uh respiratory disease
sw2190B-ms98-a-0006 30.855875 55.213625 [silence]
sw2190B-ms98-a-0007 55.213625 63.850000 well the you know that that's another arguable issue and i i've seen the uh uh uh assuming you can buy into global warming i [vocalized-noise] 
sw2190B-ms98-a-0008 63.850000 66.670000 [silence]
sw2190B-ms98-a-0009 66.670000 75.920125 well did you see Carl Sagan on Sixty Minutes on uh when he was talking about when if if the if the war started in in Kuwait and they'd set those uh all th[e]-
sw2190B-ms98-a-0010 75.920125 84.063500 uh it was it was it was interesting but uh i'm just curious what he has to say now that they've got them_1 all lit
sw2190B-ms98-a-0011 84.063500 86.730000 [silence]
sw2190B-ms98-a-0012 86.730000 94.456500 yes and his argument was uh was that that you would see a uh a year with no summer
sw2190B-ms98-a-0013 94.456500 99.157625 which actually happened it it ac[tually]- yes it actually happened uh
sw2190B-ms98-a-0014 99.157625 106.975500 it was a volcano erupted and it was high enough up but uh they had some people from the national meteorological center i think it was or [vocalized-noise] which is the national
sw2190B-ms98-a-0015 106.975500 111.863125 anyway research people and they said that the uh that the pollution would not go high enough
sw2190B-ms98-a-0016 111.863125 117.840375 and it's it's going to be interesting to see if Carl Sagan and his billions and billions of stars may have once made a mistake but
sw2190B-ms98-a-0017 117.840375 128.010875 th[e]- th[e]- th[e]- the the the [vocalized-noise] the general the opinion among among the uh meteorologists at uh i'm uh member of the American Meteorological Society and
sw2190B-ms98-a-0018 128.010875 129.246125 yeah i do
sw2190B-ms98-a-0019 129.246125 132.103375 but i'm uh i on[ly]- i do that in my formalize
sw2190B-ms98-a-0020 132.103375 134.500750 no i'm a planner a production planner
sw2190B-ms98-a-0021 134.500750 138.191125 but i- i i'm in the active reserves as a weatherman so
sw2190B-ms98-a-0022 138.191125 149.490125 uh i- i keep up from time to time but what the the argument is that uh that uh maybe there isn't global warming and maybe there is
sw2190B-ms98-a-0023 149.490125 152.980125 but um if there is
sw2190B-ms98-a-0024 152.980125 164.394375 uh we probably could do something about it now and if there isn't if there isn't and we do some the right things i think how do you feel about about all this smog and m[ess]- stuff on cars
sw2190B-ms98-a-0025 164.394375 175.019375 [silence]
sw2190B-ms98-a-0026 175.019375 177.555125 well do you have an older car
sw2190B-ms98-a-0027 177.555125 181.350250 i ha[ve]- [laughter] [laughter-i] have been working on an older car but it to yeah

sw2190B-ms98-a-0035 203.489000 206.063500 but did you have another ques[tion]- you said you had another question
sw2190B-ms98-a-0036 206.063500 231.687875 [silence]
sw2190B-ms98-a-0037 231.687875 232.751625 yeah
sw2190B-ms98-a-0038 232.751625 236.744875 no i didn't see that that i know that the uh that's
sw2190B-ms98-a-0039 236.744875 240.544250 [silence]
sw2190B-ms98-a-0040 240.544250 246.273500 well that they talked nuclear winner and and i suppose that's that's the ultimate uh pollution problem
sw2190B-ms98-a-0041 246.273500 254.136250 [silence]
sw2190B-ms98-a-0042 254.136250 255.920625 well
sw2190B-ms98-a-0043 255.920625 259.730625 [silence]
sw2190B-ms98-a-0044 259.730625 266.544250 well it's interesting that the the Chernobyl accident uh actually um because the circulation budget as high as it went
sw2190B-ms98-a-0045 266.544250 268.392875 um covered
sw2190B-ms98-a-0046 268.392875 273.658250 a a fairly remarkable amount they did some tracers and they i- i think it's drawn in uh i think
sw2190B-ms98-a-0047 273.658250 282.392750 gets in there because_1 i can't think of the other trace but i saw a presentation on on that and they it went quite a long ways but i- i- i guess
sw2190B-ms98-a-0048 282.392750 288.640625 i can be a little sympathetic but you know there's some argument that in in in the blue grass of Kentucky that the Smoky Mountains
sw2190B-ms98-a-0049 288.640625 292.734750 that that's the uh the pine trees giving off pollution and
sw2190B-ms98-a-0050 292.734750 295.594125 [silence]
sw2190B-ms98-a-0051 295.594125 302.200750 but the but when you see when you get up in the morning in in Dallas and and see all that haze from west Texas is that is that pollution
sw2190B-ms98-a-0052 302.200750 309.172500 [silence]
sw2190B-ms98-a-0053 309.172500 317.491500 well it that's the thing is that i think i think Dallas really does have a problem in this the idea if we could get some cleaner fuel
sw2190B-ms98-a-0054 317.491500 323.398250 burning fuel the problem is is it's like Los Angeles people don't people don't want to use mass transit so
sw2190B-ms98-a-0055 323.398250 329.691500 [silence]
sw2190B-ms98-a-0056 329.691500 333.096000 but who wants to who wants to um ride a bus

sw2190B-ms98-a-0058 340.588250 344.161750 well my boss drives forty miles one way each day
sw2190B-ms98-a-0059 344.161750 348.435500 and one of the guys that works with me drives forty five miles
sw2190B-ms98-a-0060 348.435500 352.711375 and and they don't think it well i guess they do think something of it but
sw2190B-ms98-a-0061 352.711375 354.808875 um not enough to
sw2190B-ms98-a-0062 354.808875 357.196375 you know you consider how much um
sw2190B-ms98-a-0063 357.196375 367.209125 but then you get into all these issues of of whether it it's the types of pollution and what it's doing to your lungs and are we going to die of of respiratory so we all move out of the
sw2190B-ms98-a-0064 367.209125 373.891625 out of downtown so we get away from the the smog my my wife grew up in southern California and they moved out to the valley
sw2190B-ms98-a-0065 373.891625 377.272625 before Los Angeles uh wh[en]- when the valley was clean
sw2190B-ms98-a-0066 377.272625 381.112750 and now the valley is not and so people move out one more valley and
sw2190B-ms98-a-0067 381.112750 386.410000 [silence]
sw2190B-ms98-a-0068 386.410000 388.268750 yes yes

sw2190B-ms98-a-0072 407.802250 412.137750 General Motors apparently has one that they're they're testing i think it's
sw2190B-ms98-a-0073 412.137750 415.134875 no it's alcohol vehicles that they're testing almost
sw2190B-ms98-a-0074 415.134875 417.715000 [silence]
sw2190B-ms98-a-0075 417.715000 419.012875 but they
sw2190B-ms98-a-0076 419.012875 420.366875 suppose
sw2190B-ms98-a-0077 420.366875 428.816625 [silence]
sw2190B-ms98-a-0078 428.816625 436.293875 huh well the Road and Track was talking about that this apparently General Motors has some uh they apparently think they're close
sw2190B-ms98-a-0079 436.293875 444.630750 [silence]
sw2190B-ms98-a-0080 444.630750 450.533125 well th[ere]- there's still a lot of research i was over in in the research lab a couple i guess it's been about a month ago and saw this
sw2190B-ms98-a-0081 450.533125 455.333250 there have been research it was a little light that says solar solar powered research
sw2190B-ms98-a-0082 455.333250 471.500625 [silence]
sw2190B-ms98-a-0083 471.500625 473.862125 yeah well do you work in that C building

sw2190B-ms98-a-0089 491.273250 492.312250 huh

sw2190B-ms98-a-0093 504.674375 508.645875 well the problem is that gas at a dollar a a gallon
sw2190B-ms98-a-0094 508.645875 510.258125 you know
sw2190B-ms98-a-0095 510.258125 517.912000 who wants to yeah i mean we want to not pollute but uh at a dollar a gallon uh it's hard to beat the amount of energy you get from [vocalized-noise]
sw2190B-ms98-a-0096 517.912000 529.289875 [silence]
sw2190B-ms98-a-0097 529.289875 532.900750 well i thought i saw an ad for Volkswagen that had an alcohol
sw2190B-ms98-a-0098 532.900750 537.441000 they had one with spots on it and something i didn't go but i[t]- wa[s]- it was showing they i mean uh
sw2190B-ms98-a-0099 537.441000 538.793625 an article
sw2190B-ms98-a-0100 538.793625 541.297875 no i didn't i didn't go so i wish
sw2190B-ms98-a-0101 541.297875 554.892750 [silence]
sw2190B-ms98-a-0102 554.892750 556.399125 they've done a lot

sw2190B-ms98-a-0106 583.119375 589.911125 well they uh it's interesting though because_1 my cars are older and so i didn't have to if you live in Dallas County
sw2190B-ms98-a-0107 589.911125 599.275375 you have to have your have to have it checked and it's great i had a friend with a Fiero that uh they tried and tried and tried and had all kinds of trouble getting that pinned and so apparently
