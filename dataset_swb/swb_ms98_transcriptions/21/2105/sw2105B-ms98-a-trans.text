sw2105B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 8.950375 real problem the last few days one of their uh young {hopely} stars has apparently ruined his knee for this season it was catcher
sw2105B-ms98-a-0002 8.950375 16.598500 and they really don't have an excess of catchers and it's really kind of kind of late to you know to start be trying to trade for somebody
sw2105B-ms98-a-0003 16.598500 20.180625 especially_1 with the salary cap that the Rangers have
sw2105B-ms98-a-0004 20.180625 23.174875 they're not the highest paying ball team around
sw2105B-ms98-a-0005 23.174875 27.866875 but i you know i would i would gladly take the salary of most of the guys i'll tell you
sw2105B-ms98-a-0006 27.866875 29.481375 yeah
sw2105B-ms98-a-0007 29.481375 38.854875 that's right i really haven't been an active Ranger fan in several years i used to go take my son you know when he was in high school he enjoyed going to the baseball game

sw2105B-ms98-a-0009 47.044375 48.353375 yeah
