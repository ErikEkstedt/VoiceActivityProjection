sw2186B-ms98-a-0002 1.305750 3.856125 okay so i guess um
sw2186B-ms98-a-0003 3.856125 11.532500 i start with maybe if if does do you know if the population favors statehood or
sw2186B-ms98-a-0004 11.532500 15.376500 what are we you were supposed to whether we favor it
sw2186B-ms98-a-0005 15.376500 22.187375 [silence]
sw2186B-ms98-a-0006 22.187375 33.183250 well see i have mixed feelings because um it it the with the financial situation i don't really quite understand what would happen there if they would be a burden to us
sw2186B-ms98-a-0007 33.183250 35.499250 or if they already are a burden
sw2186B-ms98-a-0008 35.499250 38.135500 so i i really
sw2186B-ms98-a-0009 38.135500 42.341250 what uh i really don't care you know i mean
sw2186B-ms98-a-0010 42.341250 56.913125 [silence]
sw2186B-ms98-a-0011 56.913125 62.414875 yes that i think that's true so that makes them_1 feel definitely like outsiders
sw2186B-ms98-a-0012 62.414875 66.289750 but like getting back to the their government benefits
sw2186B-ms98-a-0013 66.289750 69.807500 they they do have a lot of uh tax benefits
sw2186B-ms98-a-0014 69.807500 73.263375 [silence]
sw2186B-ms98-a-0015 73.263375 82.293000 yeah so um also of course they they can they join the they can always join the military service they are considered citizens i believe
sw2186B-ms98-a-0016 82.293000 83.840250 [silence]
sw2186B-ms98-a-0017 83.840250 84.949625 yeah they can
sw2186B-ms98-a-0018 84.949625 88.468750 [silence]
sw2186B-ms98-a-0019 88.468750 92.666000 yeah that's a strange situation you you're a citizen yet you can't vote
sw2186B-ms98-a-0020 92.666000 95.215625 s[o]- so if
sw2186B-ms98-a-0021 95.215625 111.133250 [silence]
sw2186B-ms98-a-0022 111.133250 115.203500 yes i went i worked um i went there for a class in a factory
sw2186B-ms98-a-0023 115.203500 123.152750 and some of the people in my class couldn't speak fluent English they had a very difficult time with it and they and they couldn't [noise] the ones that could speak 
sw2186B-ms98-a-0024 123.152750 126.706375 speak it had a really hard time reading it so
sw2186B-ms98-a-0025 126.706375 132.565875 [silence]
sw2186B-ms98-a-0026 132.565875 135.940750 yes as well as the the um [noise]
sw2186B-ms98-a-0027 135.940750 139.398250 the Quebec people that that speak French
sw2186B-ms98-a-0028 139.398250 140.494375 and they're s[upposed]-
sw2186B-ms98-a-0029 140.494375 141.182375 [laughter]
sw2186B-ms98-a-0030 141.182375 143.170250 they're supposed to be bilingual
sw2186B-ms98-a-0031 143.170250 144.320625 but um
sw2186B-ms98-a-0032 144.320625 152.251625 [silence]
sw2186B-ms98-a-0033 152.251625 158.631000 yes what do you what do you um do you do you think they should become independent maybe or do you think they should [vocalized-noise] benefit
sw2186B-ms98-a-0034 158.631000 170.741500 [silence]
sw2186B-ms98-a-0035 170.741500 179.425500 yeah i think if i was a middle class Puerto Rican maybe that that would be the um stablest thing to do
sw2186B-ms98-a-0036 179.425500 183.402625 [silence]
sw2186B-ms98-a-0037 183.402625 184.439250 they would
sw2186B-ms98-a-0038 184.439250 196.124500 [silence]
sw2186B-ms98-a-0039 196.124500 197.185500 yes
sw2186B-ms98-a-0040 197.185500 199.302625 [silence]
sw2186B-ms98-a-0041 199.302625 204.456250 so they've been talking about this for a long time do you think they're going to ever vote
sw2186B-ms98-a-0042 204.456250 208.123625 whether they want one one of the three choices
sw2186B-ms98-a-0043 208.123625 209.637750 [silence]
sw2186B-ms98-a-0044 209.637750 215.999250 i know because i think i've been rea[ding]- i read this ten years ago that they were having these big uh
sw2186B-ms98-a-0045 215.999250 224.318125 um rallies and people would be in the streets flashing signs statehood yes and other people would s[tatehood]- down the statehood
sw2186B-ms98-a-0046 224.318125 229.188125 it's it down there if you're um familiar with their politics
sw2186B-ms98-a-0047 229.188125 230.380375 they uh
sw2186B-ms98-a-0048 230.380375 242.592625 it's very uh i- i don't know it's called Latino there they have loudspeakers on their cars and they run down the neighborhood saying vote for you know Pierre he's or uh Pe[dro]- uh
sw2186B-ms98-a-0049 242.592625 246.656125 Pedro he's the best i[t's]- it's really kind of comical
sw2186B-ms98-a-0050 246.656125 248.833750 [silence]
sw2186B-ms98-a-0051 248.833750 253.606500 yeah these these people they have the big loudspeakers because they have uh
sw2186B-ms98-a-0052 253.606500 268.162500 democratic system just like ours where they elect their mayors and their councilmens it's really kind of funny it's it's kind of an invasion of your p[rivacy]- privacy too they're going down these streets with these really loud speakers
sw2186B-ms98-a-0053 268.162500 277.979000 [silence]
sw2186B-ms98-a-0054 277.979000 283.062000 yeah there there's some really poor areas where when i went [noise] uh
sw2186B-ms98-a-0055 283.062000 286.334875 it it looked like it was it was always
sw2186B-ms98-a-0056 286.334875 296.644625 you couldn't if you didn't know the area they they didn't advise you to go out and uh you know go in the the uh poorer sections of town
sw2186B-ms98-a-0057 296.644625 301.100250 but the the big cities where the uh big hotels were
sw2186B-ms98-a-0058 301.100250 310.803625 tha[t]- that was that was safe ground to walk around but uh particularly in San Juan we wanted to go walk on the beach at night [laughter-and] they looked at us like we were crazy
sw2186B-ms98-a-0059 310.803625 313.865500 says no you can't go at night because_1 uh
sw2186B-ms98-a-0060 313.865500 320.007375 we were we our business was on the other side of the island we were only in San Juan it was at night
sw2186B-ms98-a-0061 320.007375 324.264000 they don't want us go out on the beach you know said it was very dangerous
sw2186B-ms98-a-0062 324.264000 325.796000 [silence]
sw2186B-ms98-a-0063 325.796000 330.934250 um actually we um m[et]- met some people that were in the naval base down there
sw2186B-ms98-a-0064 330.934250 338.712375 and uh they didn't particularly like living down there because it was very foreign very different the the people
sw2186B-ms98-a-0065 338.712375 349.362125 they they didn't treat them nice they you know um so i think there i what i learned from them there was a lot of resentment towards the Americans
sw2186B-ms98-a-0066 349.362125 353.970625 so and it was like they were they're Puerto Rican and were Americans
sw2186B-ms98-a-0067 353.970625 361.091875 so that's why they're so um emotional about about statehood yet like you say it's
sw2186B-ms98-a-0068 361.091875 363.801250 they can't really support themselves so
sw2186B-ms98-a-0069 363.801250 365.084750 [silence]
sw2186B-ms98-a-0070 365.084750 368.417875 yeah that's very true
sw2186B-ms98-a-0071 368.417875 372.741375 [silence]
sw2186B-ms98-a-0072 372.741375 377.296875 [laughter]
sw2186B-ms98-a-0073 377.296875 379.743875 i don't know that that's a good one
sw2186B-ms98-a-0074 379.743875 381.425125 [laughter]
sw2186B-ms98-a-0075 381.425125 385.794000 yeah but the thing the thing that bothers me about it the most is
sw2186B-ms98-a-0076 385.794000 392.008375 they don't make decision they don't vote i i think if they voted th[at]- that as you say the um
sw2186B-ms98-a-0077 392.008375 396.027375 they they would probably stay commonwealth or that would be the best for them
sw2186B-ms98-a-0078 396.027375 411.850625 [silence]
sw2186B-ms98-a-0079 411.850625 413.190875 yeah
sw2186B-ms98-a-0080 413.190875 417.343125 but as you say it's two di[fferent]- two different cultures
sw2186B-ms98-a-0081 417.343125 419.823625 i don't i don't know
sw2186B-ms98-a-0082 419.823625 427.578750 um so uh you like i say i was reading this ten years ago whether they could they're going to be talking about this in another ten years
sw2186B-ms98-a-0083 427.578750 429.745500 i don't see them doing anything
sw2186B-ms98-a-0084 429.745500 431.616750 [silence]
sw2186B-ms98-a-0085 431.616750 432.888875 so
sw2186B-ms98-a-0086 432.888875 437.231125 i don't know and it's also a long way away
sw2186B-ms98-a-0087 437.231125 438.303000 [laughter]
sw2186B-ms98-a-0088 438.303000 440.612000 if you know if it was Cuba
sw2186B-ms98-a-0089 440.612000 449.290500 yes Cuba's really close [vocalized-noise] but uh Puerto Rica is uh is it's like uh i live in Vermont from Vermont to Florida it's another 
sw2186B-ms98-a-0090 449.290500 454.474750 another uh what fourteen hundred miles across the ocean
sw2186B-ms98-a-0091 454.474750 456.022500 but uh
sw2186B-ms98-a-0092 456.022500 457.023125 [silence]
sw2186B-ms98-a-0093 457.023125 460.650375 yeah and they have to they have to import a lot of their um
sw2186B-ms98-a-0094 460.650375 466.715750 cereals and things a[nd]- and i don't understand now why they don't have a processing i guess
sw2186B-ms98-a-0095 466.715750 475.345000 i[t]- i uh they it's just as easy to bring the uh cereal in boxes as it is to bring it in in you know bulk grain and produce it there
sw2186B-ms98-a-0096 475.345000 476.398625 [silence]
sw2186B-ms98-a-0097 476.398625 479.200750 uh i really don't know um
sw2186B-ms98-a-0098 479.200750 482.164000 [silence]
sw2186B-ms98-a-0099 482.164000 492.918750 it could be i'm sure they rely heavily on tourism and even [vocalized-noise] the all the American companies down there with their uh electronics industries and pharmaceuticals are big down there 
sw2186B-ms98-a-0100 492.918750 501.485000 that's one thing i did notice uh pharmaceuticals electronics tha[t]- makes up i mean enough to be like eight or ten percent of their business
sw2186B-ms98-a-0101 501.485000 514.351750 but um i really don't know agriculturally they could have so much and they and they don't they don't seem to uh i don't know if i heard they don't feed themselves or not i don't think they support themselves
sw2186B-ms98-a-0102 514.351750 517.738000 agriculturally i found that to be really odd
sw2186B-ms98-a-0103 517.738000 520.018000 [silence]
sw2186B-ms98-a-0104 520.018000 527.699250 you know well they see they can't grow the grains i mean they're if the i guess their grains don't do well in the tropics
sw2186B-ms98-a-0105 527.699250 533.481750 so like you say they gr[ow]- grow sugar beets and sugar cane and that's all export
sw2186B-ms98-a-0106 533.481750 536.813500 [silence]
sw2186B-ms98-a-0107 536.813500 541.856625 well yeah that is it's mountainous and uh but it [noise]
sw2186B-ms98-a-0108 541.856625 548.470375 it looks fertile and it it um i mean it rains enough they have the climate and the rain
sw2186B-ms98-a-0109 548.470375 553.880000 and if not it's like i've been to Saint Thomas and it just starts from the ocean up
sw2186B-ms98-a-0110 553.880000 560.185250 and i[t's]- and it's very it's like one big rock but uh Puerto Rico has lots of uh
sw2186B-ms98-a-0111 560.185250 564.983000 lots of uh mountainous region and coastal regions
sw2186B-ms98-a-0112 564.983000 570.914250 [silence]
sw2186B-ms98-a-0113 570.914250 573.398125 yeah i don't know uh i i[t]-
sw2186B-ms98-a-0114 573.398125 577.415250 [silence]
sw2186B-ms98-a-0115 577.415250 580.377250 that's very true i don't know if they just
sw2186B-ms98-a-0116 580.377250 587.638500 take it for granted that they you know it's an American commonwealth they really don't have to advertise that much but that is an interesting point
sw2186B-ms98-a-0117 587.638500 591.656375 but i i believe it's a very popular vacation destination
sw2186B-ms98-a-0118 591.656375 593.447500 [silence]
sw2186B-ms98-a-0119 593.447500 594.715375 yep
sw2186B-ms98-a-0120 594.715375 599.838875 [silence]
