sw2186A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 14.762250 [silence]
sw2186A-ms98-a-0002 14.762250 21.943375 well i'm not i'm not sure what what the people of Puerto Rico feel uh how do you feel about uh the possibility of Puerto Rico becoming a state
sw2186A-ms98-a-0003 21.943375 40.966500 [silence]
sw2186A-ms98-a-0004 40.966500 46.773750 yeah well i question whether it's in their best interests to become a state right now they are a commonwealth
sw2186A-ms98-a-0005 46.773750 52.528750 and that means that they are under US protection in the event of uh defending their their country
sw2186A-ms98-a-0006 52.528750 57.509500 uh they do not have any voting privileges though and i don't believe they have any representation in Congress
sw2186A-ms98-a-0007 57.509500 69.345875 [silence]
sw2186A-ms98-a-0008 69.345875 73.224250 yeah i don't believe they have to pay any uh like federal tax uh
sw2186A-ms98-a-0009 73.224250 82.373500 [silence]
sw2186A-ms98-a-0010 82.373500 86.390625 uh yeah i think they are they they do get uh priv[ileges]- privileges like that
sw2186A-ms98-a-0011 86.390625 88.946625 i'm not sure how much that uh carries on
sw2186A-ms98-a-0012 88.946625 92.316125 [silence]
sw2186A-ms98-a-0013 92.316125 94.169125 [laughter] yeah [laughter]
sw2186A-ms98-a-0014 94.169125 100.980875 well i think we've got uh like a language barrier too i think most of the people there speak only Spanish i'm not sure how fluent they are in English
sw2186A-ms98-a-0015 100.980875 104.140250 and that's one of the major problems i i see with uh
sw2186A-ms98-a-0016 104.140250 111.299625 other countries as such being uh say the possibility of becoming states that we don't have a common language with them
sw2186A-ms98-a-0017 111.299625 125.172500 [silence]
sw2186A-ms98-a-0018 125.172500 128.709750 right i think we'd have the same type of problem say with Mexico
sw2186A-ms98-a-0019 128.709750 134.391000 uh Canada on the other hand uh English is one of their national languages they have
sw2186A-ms98-a-0020 134.391000 138.518000 [silence]
sw2186A-ms98-a-0021 138.518000 140.345375 yeah uh-huh
sw2186A-ms98-a-0022 140.345375 142.448750 so i think they're
sw2186A-ms98-a-0023 142.448750 143.939000 yeah
sw2186A-ms98-a-0024 143.939000 152.221750 i just see a lot of uh social and cultural differences that could uh pose problems with uh Puerto Rico becoming a state
sw2186A-ms98-a-0025 152.221750 156.060875 [silence]
sw2186A-ms98-a-0026 156.060875 157.699000 um
sw2186A-ms98-a-0027 157.699000 161.174750 i don't think they're strong enough myself to become independent
sw2186A-ms98-a-0028 161.174750 165.924000 uh i think that it's in their best interest right now just uh to remain as is
sw2186A-ms98-a-0029 165.924000 171.070875 keep the status quo and uh keep uh stay under the U[nited]- United States protection
sw2186A-ms98-a-0030 171.070875 179.052625 [silence]
sw2186A-ms98-a-0031 179.052625 184.335500 yeah because i think that if they if they tried for independence they would probably have uh
sw2186A-ms98-a-0032 184.335500 194.141125 military factions that would oppose each other and and they would vie for leadership and uh the people who are well off there the middle upper class if there is such a thing
sw2186A-ms98-a-0033 194.141125 199.753750 uh they would probably be at a disadvantage losing possibility of losing their uh their assets or wealth
sw2186A-ms98-a-0034 199.753750 204.379625 [silence]
sw2186A-ms98-a-0035 204.379625 205.663125 uh
sw2186A-ms98-a-0036 205.663125 207.595125 [silence]
sw2186A-ms98-a-0037 207.595125 209.954625 i don't see it in the near future
sw2186A-ms98-a-0038 209.954625 242.669250 [silence]
sw2186A-ms98-a-0039 242.669250 244.913250 [laughter]
sw2186A-ms98-a-0040 244.913250 246.355125 [silence]
sw2186A-ms98-a-0041 246.355125 250.503125 yeah well i've never been there i'm not quite familiar with with uh the way they do things
sw2186A-ms98-a-0042 250.503125 263.999500 [silence]
sw2186A-ms98-a-0043 263.999500 265.144000 uh-huh
sw2186A-ms98-a-0044 265.144000 267.359500 [silence]
sw2186A-ms98-a-0045 267.359500 272.773125 yeah oh i think that you know part of the biggest problem there is that they still really are third world country
sw2186A-ms98-a-0046 272.773125 278.020875 and they haven't uh caught up uh economically with uh say the United States
sw2186A-ms98-a-0047 278.020875 305.945000 [silence]
sw2186A-ms98-a-0048 305.945000 307.083750 uh-huh

sw2186A-ms98-a-0050 319.497125 320.579500 okay
sw2186A-ms98-a-0051 320.579500 323.856500 [silence]
sw2186A-ms98-a-0052 323.856500 327.031000 well did you have guides from the area or escorts or uh
sw2186A-ms98-a-0053 327.031000 330.151500 [silence]
sw2186A-ms98-a-0054 330.151500 331.456000 okay
sw2186A-ms98-a-0055 331.456000 340.428750 [silence]
sw2186A-ms98-a-0056 340.428750 341.980750 okay

sw2186A-ms98-a-0058 353.168500 354.336625 right
sw2186A-ms98-a-0059 354.336625 362.822000 [silence]
sw2186A-ms98-a-0060 362.822000 366.975000 yeah well they've got that Latin blood they get fired up about every little thing anyway
sw2186A-ms98-a-0061 366.975000 374.041250 i think one of the most interesting things about the possibility of uh attaining a fifty first state is what would we do about our flag how do you arrange fifty one stars
sw2186A-ms98-a-0062 374.041250 374.990625 [laughter]
sw2186A-ms98-a-0063 374.990625 377.540375 what kind of pattern does do we come up with for that
sw2186A-ms98-a-0064 377.540375 379.239875 [silence]
sw2186A-ms98-a-0065 379.239875 380.556625 could have a contest
sw2186A-ms98-a-0066 380.556625 381.630625 [laughter]
sw2186A-ms98-a-0067 381.630625 395.707250 [silence]
sw2186A-ms98-a-0068 395.707250 399.813500 well that would give them_1 them more of an interest in what goes on in this country
sw2186A-ms98-a-0069 399.813500 404.411250 if if they had uh uh a a uh a privilege of voting
sw2186A-ms98-a-0070 404.411250 407.919875 uh that would give them a vested interest in the government and uh
sw2186A-ms98-a-0071 407.919875 411.995875 i would see that as as a positive uh thing for them to consider
sw2186A-ms98-a-0072 411.995875 426.632750 [silence]
sw2186A-ms98-a-0073 426.632750 428.661375 probably
sw2186A-ms98-a-0074 428.661375 431.910875 uh yeah i really don't see any change in the near future
sw2186A-ms98-a-0075 431.910875 436.289375 [silence]
sw2186A-ms98-a-0076 436.289375 437.604750 [laughter]

sw2186A-ms98-a-0080 453.403000 454.776500 right
sw2186A-ms98-a-0081 454.776500 456.691875 that is a good distance
sw2186A-ms98-a-0082 456.691875 474.567500 [silence]
sw2186A-ms98-a-0083 474.567500 476.886375 what is their major industry
sw2186A-ms98-a-0084 476.886375 477.912875 [silence]
sw2186A-ms98-a-0085 477.912875 483.249250 is it uh i i believe is it sugar cane or i'm not su[re]- sure exactly what they do
sw2186A-ms98-a-0086 483.249250 492.515875 [silence]
sw2186A-ms98-a-0087 492.515875 494.498125 right okay

sw2186A-ms98-a-0089 516.491250 520.138000 yeah i'm not very familiar with with the the state of their a[griculture]- agriculture
sw2186A-ms98-a-0090 520.138000 530.496125 [silence]
sw2186A-ms98-a-0091 530.496125 532.618875 right you have to question
sw2186A-ms98-a-0092 532.618875 536.880250 have to wonder how much tillable land they have uh being an island 
sw2186A-ms98-a-0093 536.880250 539.157500 [silence]
sw2186A-ms98-a-0094 539.157500 540.356875 uh-huh

sw2186A-ms98-a-0100 563.039625 571.266125 yeah i know they must have a lot of tourism too but i don't see as much advertising there as you do in the Baha[mas]- the say the Bahamas
sw2186A-ms98-a-0101 571.266125 577.860875 with uh say uh uh Saint Thomas uh Virgin Islands uh places like that
sw2186A-ms98-a-0102 577.860875 590.758000 [silence]
sw2186A-ms98-a-0103 590.758000 594.006125 right well the Virgin Islands are an American territory
sw2186A-ms98-a-0104 594.006125 599.838875 and but you see a lot of advertising for that uh as far as uh vacation uh cruises and re[tirement]-
