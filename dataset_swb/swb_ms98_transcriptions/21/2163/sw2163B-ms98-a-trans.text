sw2163B-ms98-a-0029 93.492625 98.763750 well i've been pretty lucky in that respect i don't charge like i say i've i been trying to
sw2163B-ms98-a-0030 98.763750 102.464875 to not charge except for emergencies
sw2163B-ms98-a-0031 102.464875 113.994125 so but i haven't really had any bad problems with credit cards there's you know they have uh wonderful features they're there when you need them you know like in emergencies or whatever

sw2163B-ms98-a-0035 122.247500 123.991375 [silence]
sw2163B-ms98-a-0036 123.991375 127.710750 i try to i did switch to one uh
sw2163B-ms98-a-0037 127.710750 131.995125 sponsored by the credit union though that seems to be a pretty low interest
sw2163B-ms98-a-0038 131.995125 137.994375 yeah compared to some of the other ones and you don't have an annual fee there and that helps
