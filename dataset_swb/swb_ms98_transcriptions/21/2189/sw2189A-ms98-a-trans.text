sw2189A-ms98-a-0002 2.544875 14.184750 well Bo was uh playing football actually you know he plays both football and base[ball]- and baseball and he was plays and during a tackle he ended up either damaging his hip or you know injuring his hip
sw2189A-ms98-a-0003 14.184750 23.943375 and there's been arthritis and he's been out for a number of of sea[sons]- games and it just as of announced today the Kansas City Royals put him up on waivers made him a free agent
sw2189A-ms98-a-0004 23.943375 29.719000 so they're saying now that Bo knows arthritis and it could be actually a career ending injury
sw2189A-ms98-a-0005 29.719000 41.827750 so they had uh they're having actually a special on today and they were mentioning that and even though Kansas City may have dropped him some other teams may pick him up but the big thing was that Nike
sw2189A-ms98-a-0006 41.827750 47.355375 uh the athletic shoe company is still going to keep him on as one of there cross trainer sponsors
sw2189A-ms98-a-0007 47.355375 51.461500 and since that makes him more money anyhow [laughter]
sw2189A-ms98-a-0008 51.461500 54.393875 [silence]
sw2189A-ms98-a-0009 54.393875 59.898250 yeah he does it it's pretty amazing though how much he can get for endorsements anymore
sw2189A-ms98-a-0010 59.898250 65.142000 [silence]
sw2189A-ms98-a-0011 65.142000 67.576750 i wouldn't be surprised whatsoever
sw2189A-ms98-a-0012 67.576750 82.247875 on the same program they had Michael Jordan they were saying that he gets about six million dollars for playing with the Chicago Bulls about i think two million dollars for endorsing McDonald's and fourteen million dollars for his endorsements with Nike
sw2189A-ms98-a-0013 82.247875 85.278875 and then of course he's got uh Wheaties also
sw2189A-ms98-a-0014 85.278875 85.440125 [laughter]
sw2189A-ms98-a-0015 85.440125 87.911000 and that's that's in a year
sw2189A-ms98-a-0016 87.911000 90.542000 that's uh what would you do with all that money
sw2189A-ms98-a-0017 90.542000 93.287000 [silence]
sw2189A-ms98-a-0018 93.287000 95.960875 [laughter]
sw2189A-ms98-a-0019 95.960875 97.698250 [silence]
sw2189A-ms98-a-0020 97.698250 100.003125 [laughter]
sw2189A-ms98-a-0021 100.003125 102.329375 yeah i could make that go a lot of places
sw2189A-ms98-a-0022 102.329375 103.315625 [laughter]
sw2189A-ms98-a-0023 103.315625 108.282250 it's amazing anymore there's a also a program on this evening about the
sw2189A-ms98-a-0024 108.282250 115.669625 a very sports intensive evening it seems to be on TV about the business of college athletics
sw2189A-ms98-a-0025 115.669625 129.133750 [silence]
sw2189A-ms98-a-0026 129.133750 130.767375 uh-huh
sw2189A-ms98-a-0027 130.767375 140.002625 yeah it it talked about all SMU and their the death penalty and how they're getting around all the regulations and rules and and things of that nature
sw2189A-ms98-a-0028 140.002625 142.617625 i guess anymore it's just a big business
sw2189A-ms98-a-0029 142.617625 152.307875 [silence]
sw2189A-ms98-a-0030 152.307875 153.741250 uh-huh
sw2189A-ms98-a-0031 153.741250 158.321875 i think it al[so]- probably also m[ore]- is more as you get into the the big schools
sw2189A-ms98-a-0032 158.321875 169.427625 the ones that the TVs are going to cover and things anyhow when you still have the the lower sides or the smaller schools they're all doing it just for the for the love of the game because they're not getting the big revenues from anyone
sw2189A-ms98-a-0033 169.427625 176.540125 [silence]
sw2189A-ms98-a-0034 176.540125 177.804625 uh-huh
sw2189A-ms98-a-0035 177.804625 181.458750 [silence]

sw2189A-ms98-a-0037 183.273875 185.651625 [silence]
sw2189A-ms98-a-0038 185.651625 200.095500 they actually mentioned a little on the fact that he's started to instigate a program where he's actually uh not necessary they say he's getting around the rules somewhat but it's actually sounds like a pretty good idea where he goes out and recruits other
sw2189A-ms98-a-0039 200.095500 207.813875 students who don't meet the minimum academic requirements to get into the college and and then qualify for a student athlete position
sw2189A-ms98-a-0040 207.813875 213.580625 and he takes them and signs some contract or something with them but sends them then then to junior college
sw2189A-ms98-a-0041 213.580625 215.688000 [silence]
sw2189A-ms98-a-0042 215.688000 218.650750 so at least that's uh some way that they're
sw2189A-ms98-a-0043 218.650750 229.298375 you know i- i guess the best part about it you can't just drop off all schol[arship]- scholarships because it does i would imagine at least in it's intentions help a lot of people who couldn't afford to go to school
sw2189A-ms98-a-0044 229.298375 235.841125 but that seemed like it was actually uh you know if there's a good way to get around a rule that sounded like it was a pretty smart way
sw2189A-ms98-a-0045 235.841125 239.375000 [silence]
sw2189A-ms98-a-0046 239.375000 243.498625 well uh at least it's hopefully still helping the the student
sw2189A-ms98-a-0047 243.498625 247.411750 you're not uh going to graduate somebody who still can't read and write
sw2189A-ms98-a-0048 247.411750 248.952750 [silence]
