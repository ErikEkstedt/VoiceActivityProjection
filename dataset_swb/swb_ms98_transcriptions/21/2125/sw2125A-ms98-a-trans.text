sw2125A-ms98-a-0007 60.434250 64.475000 so they'll actually fit in the canoe and then you go for days at a time
sw2125A-ms98-a-0008 64.475000 80.308375 [silence]
sw2125A-ms98-a-0009 80.308375 83.639375 God that sounds like fun [laughter]
sw2125A-ms98-a-0010 83.639375 88.650500 well the camping i grew up with was like tents and Coleman stove type and uh
sw2125A-ms98-a-0011 88.650500 99.772750 you know that just either out in the woods or actually i i grew up water skiing i was uh from California and so we would go up to the Sacramento uh river sloughs the delta there
sw2125A-ms98-a-0012 99.772750 106.858375 and you just pick a campground on the river if it got you know over a hundred and ten degrees you went over the levee and jumped in the water [laughter]
sw2125A-ms98-a-0013 106.858375 115.601625 you know cooled off but uh when i got married my husband had always backpacked and so we did that uh
sw2125A-ms98-a-0014 115.601625 128.794250 i guess that we haven't done it since my kids were born so about three years ago and that was a new experience to me but i enjoyed it i like being able to go back up into the mountains or you know where the trail didn't necessarily lead and where you couldn't necessarily pitch a [laughter-tent]
sw2125A-ms98-a-0015 128.794250 137.884625 but uh that that was interesting i i have always wanted to do some white water rafting and so your canoeing kind of made me think of [laughter-that]

sw2125A-ms98-a-0024 178.160375 186.338625 and you know i there's that sense of it you know you're kind of scared that risk of like gosh what could happen and then the thrill of you know the excitement of doing it [laughter]
