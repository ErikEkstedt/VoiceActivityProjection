sw2150A-ms98-a-0010 42.493500 45.653875 so if they're going to have it to me they ought to do it

sw2150A-ms98-a-0041 153.459125 167.307375 you know but just like if a man and wife is fighting and he kills her that he shouldn't die because it might been accident or you never know what you know what what they done went through together should i say
sw2150A-ms98-a-0042 167.307375 168.998125 [noise]
sw2150A-ms98-a-0043 168.998125 172.847000 i don't think they give them the death penalty if given today anyway
sw2150A-ms98-a-0044 172.847000 177.729625 i think they just put them in jail and let them think about it [laughter]

sw2150A-ms98-a-0050 188.232875 191.743875 die because_1 it all depends
sw2150A-ms98-a-0051 191.743875 199.723500 there's a lot of circumstance sometimes i even feel like and up in another state i think it was Ohio where they don't have uh
sw2150A-ms98-a-0052 199.723500 202.988000 self-defense laws and i think that's wrong
sw2150A-ms98-a-0053 202.988000 205.699875 [silence]
sw2150A-ms98-a-0054 205.699875 215.704250 yeah they had them on the news this lady her husband she was sev[en]- i'll never forget it because she was seven months pregnant and he hit her in the stomach and then tried to cut her throat
sw2150A-ms98-a-0055 215.704250 218.692875 well she shot him and she went to prison
sw2150A-ms98-a-0056 218.692875 225.494000 she you know she killed him but she lost her baby and then they sent her to jail so that's not right
sw2150A-ms98-a-0057 225.494000 230.246750 they she's nothing should have happened to her at all he shouldn't have hit her in the stomach i don't care
sw2150A-ms98-a-0058 230.246750 231.994000 [laughter]
sw2150A-ms98-a-0059 231.994000 233.002750 [silence]
sw2150A-ms98-a-0060 233.002750 234.997500 but he did both
sw2150A-ms98-a-0061 234.997500 236.748125 [silence]
sw2150A-ms98-a-0062 236.748125 245.480000 well he was he he she was abused woman he was he was a a what do you call it abuser he would he would beat his wife all the time
sw2150A-ms98-a-0063 245.480000 247.220250 oh yeah

sw2150A-ms98-a-0066 251.491500 254.257500 he hit her in the stomach with the shovel
sw2150A-ms98-a-0067 254.257500 264.278625 it's just you know things like that that you know i don't think those women or even a man because_1 a man they had a wo[man]- man that his wife shot him but he didn't die
sw2150A-ms98-a-0068 264.278625 275.995625 and uh they put her in jail now i don't think anything should happen to him but i think she should stay in there because really she just did it because she wanted to get out the marriage and she wanted all his property
sw2150A-ms98-a-0069 275.995625 278.236875 see i think that's wrong too
sw2150A-ms98-a-0070 278.236875 279.699625 but i don't
sw2150A-ms98-a-0071 279.699625 292.201750 no she she wouldn't have got no property see there was no grounds for divorce she was she wanted out cause she had a boyfriend and it was weird but uh the capital punishment i don't know actually what they give the death penalty for
sw2150A-ms98-a-0072 292.201750 301.977500 the only thing i i know they give it for is shooting a killing a cop or you know assassination of the President and and something big you know

sw2150A-ms98-a-0078 316.993375 329.962250 no if they going to give it to them i think they should go ahead you know okay maybe a year or you know like that two years whatever but twenty years ten years on death to me that's worse for them too
sw2150A-ms98-a-0079 329.962250 337.249500 they're not they don't know when they going to die they know they got the death penalty but that don't mean nothing not anymore [noise]

sw2150A-ms98-a-0093 382.249625 385.267875 but i think they going to have to do something
sw2150A-ms98-a-0094 385.267875 389.256875 to make people wake up like on especially the drug dealers
sw2150A-ms98-a-0095 389.256875 394.488000 you know the the not the little penny ante ones on the corner i don't think they ought to get in trouble
sw2150A-ms98-a-0096 394.488000 403.984500 i mean i know they ought to get in trouble i'm not [vocalized-noise] they ought to get in trouble but not not death because_1 see they you know we're to me what they ought to do if they can find the big man
sw2150A-ms98-a-0097 403.984500 415.162375 because see that's where it's coming from to me it it's coming in here some kind of way i don't care what anybody tells me people tell me i said if the government really want to i think it's all government something to do with the government i really do
sw2150A-ms98-a-0098 415.162375 421.745875 because if you can stop uh Cuban cigars from coming you can't buy anything Cuban
sw2150A-ms98-a-0099 421.745875 425.991375 in the United States so why can't they stop anything illegal
sw2150A-ms98-a-0100 425.991375 436.472750 you know if they really wanted to i think they could they just don't want to put there's too much money people's been bought out you know and that's what's wrong with some of the kids on the street
sw2150A-ms98-a-0101 436.472750 436.974875 [noise]
sw2150A-ms98-a-0102 436.974875 442.717625 they you can't blame just like the man says he can make two five hundred dollars a day
sw2150A-ms98-a-0103 442.717625 445.296000 for just taking a bag somewhere
sw2150A-ms98-a-0104 445.296000 445.704000 [noise]
sw2150A-ms98-a-0105 445.704000 448.657000 and his mom is not getting that much money
sw2150A-ms98-a-0106 448.657000 452.742125 you know if you think you think about all the kids in the ghetto
sw2150A-ms98-a-0107 452.742125 457.731375 my mom would probably kill us but [laughter]
sw2150A-ms98-a-0108 457.731375 471.996875 but uh you know it's something that has to be done to me if they bring kids into it because now kids are killing and so they going to have to do something with the death penalty or to scare these people i think that's the whole thing they're not scared they know they're not going anywhere
sw2150A-ms98-a-0109 471.996875 475.320625 [noise]
sw2150A-ms98-a-0110 475.320625 483.967375 uh-huh innocent people not just the drug people i'm talking about innocent people when they have they little drive by shootings and and and see because i'm from Los Angeles
sw2150A-ms98-a-0111 483.967375 489.264000 see originally i've been in Texas twelve thirteen years
sw2150A-ms98-a-0112 489.264000 499.997000 but originally in LA they people die all the time just from being in the way at the wrong place you know see you know but i think something should be done for them
sw2150A-ms98-a-0113 499.997000 501.297750 [silence]
sw2150A-ms98-a-0114 501.297750 502.665500 so
sw2150A-ms98-a-0115 502.665500 503.999000 [silence]
sw2150A-ms98-a-0116 503.999000 507.243250 but i don't know too much about the death penalty
sw2150A-ms98-a-0117 507.243250 513.701625 [silence]
sw2150A-ms98-a-0118 513.701625 516.995500 yeah but they don't use that no more
sw2150A-ms98-a-0119 516.995500 521.499500 they use the the injection thing or whatever it is
sw2150A-ms98-a-0120 521.499500 524.986500 [noise]

sw2150A-ms98-a-0122 526.237125 527.774000 [silence]
sw2150A-ms98-a-0123 527.774000 540.231875 it's funny because i had listened to a comedian talk about the death penalty you know about people saying they they don't have nobody to do this and i said well if somebody killed my husband just because
sw2150A-ms98-a-0124 540.231875 541.742000 i'll pull the switch
sw2150A-ms98-a-0125 541.742000 549.999875 i'll even do you know to me if if that person can forgive them fine but what is that man going to do next is he going to go out and kill somebody else
sw2150A-ms98-a-0126 549.999875 554.261875 you know how many times is it going to take for this man to kill people before you kill him
sw2150A-ms98-a-0127 554.261875 555.499375 [silence]
sw2150A-ms98-a-0128 555.499375 566.314250 now you know sometimes i can understand maybe if they robbed something they didn't mean to do it okay but how many times you going to go by that how many times you going to this person keep killing so i don't know
sw2150A-ms98-a-0129 566.314250 569.479750 i guess if you stay out of trouble you don't have you worry about it but
sw2150A-ms98-a-0130 569.479750 571.499875 [laughter]
sw2150A-ms98-a-0131 571.499875 573.999125 [silence]

sw2150A-ms98-a-0133 575.708875 580.498000 so i think it just i think it depends on the circumstances and
sw2150A-ms98-a-0134 580.498000 584.990125 how many times that person has been in trouble i mean really big trouble
sw2150A-ms98-a-0135 584.990125 587.510125 you know so
sw2150A-ms98-a-0136 587.510125 589.989125 but that's all i got to say
sw2150A-ms98-a-0137 589.989125 590.996625 [silence]
