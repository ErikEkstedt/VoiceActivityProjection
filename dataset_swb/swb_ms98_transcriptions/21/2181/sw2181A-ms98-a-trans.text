sw2181A-ms98-a-0002 0.563875 7.446875 yes i saw Home Alone with some friends just a couple days ago i wanted to see it uh because it was uh
sw2181A-ms98-a-0003 7.446875 9.345625 much recommended
sw2181A-ms98-a-0004 9.345625 17.723625 uh for months and months and months and it was a a genre that i wasn't in the least bit interested in and i usually when i hear about a movie that's supposed to be very good
sw2181A-ms98-a-0005 17.723625 29.967250 even if it's in a genre i don't like i figure well i should go see it because if this is you know the best of the genre and i should know about it or something like that and i usually come away thinking no i really don't like this [laughter-show] [laughter]
sw2181A-ms98-a-0006 29.967250 32.800750 [laughter]

sw2181A-ms98-a-0010 43.184875 45.030000 yeah yeah
sw2181A-ms98-a-0011 45.030000 59.257125 well the the problem i had with the movie was the problem i've had with a lot of uh i guess Hollywood movies which is you know it's a formula movie and they're making the movie according to a certain formula that's a good formula but they seem to
sw2181A-ms98-a-0012 59.257125 61.190625 fall short of
sw2181A-ms98-a-0013 61.190625 71.265625 of being really creative with a lot of things i mean here's the situation of this kid at home you know it's a classic slapstick situation with these bungling burglars trying to get in
sw2181A-ms98-a-0014 71.265625 78.965125 and yeah he did some clever things but given the size of the house and how clever the kid was it seems to me they could have done a lot more
sw2181A-ms98-a-0015 78.965125 87.524000 i mean you know ba[sically]- basically stepping on things and yelling in pain and it seems to me they could have been a lot more creative stuff used
sw2181A-ms98-a-0016 87.524000 93.790250 [silence]
sw2181A-ms98-a-0017 93.790250 94.956250 uh-huh

sw2181A-ms98-a-0021 101.006375 107.686500 well i guess it was a uh a very successful movie financially so we may say [laughter-more] [laughter-slapstick] [laughter]
sw2181A-ms98-a-0022 107.686500 109.432500 [silence]
sw2181A-ms98-a-0023 109.432500 114.447875 yeah it is it is [vocalized-noise] and i guess you don't have to but you know if you look at
sw2181A-ms98-a-0024 114.447875 121.775375 oh have you ever seen any of the Jacques Teti Teti movies eh the the French movies uh Teti it it

sw2181A-ms98-a-0039 172.797000 176.882625 [silence]
sw2181A-ms98-a-0040 176.882625 188.605500 they have they have a long [vocalized-noise] yes they like Jerry Lewis much to the chagrin of sophisticated Ame[rican]- quote unquote sophisticated American record company but they have this one guy Jacques Teti that does slapstick comedy and there's something about it
sw2181A-ms98-a-0041 188.605500 200.590875 that's so innovative you know he'll just have trouble picking up his hat or catching his umbrella blowing in the wind or something but there's something about it that just it isn't just slapstick there's something about the human character in it
sw2181A-ms98-a-0042 200.590875 205.500250 and that's what i find lacking in a lot of you know like Home Alone
sw2181A-ms98-a-0043 205.500250 219.449875 there was a lot of the human character when he was home alone and he was trying to be tough and they s had a lot of human character there but when it was the real slapstick moments him versus the criminals kind of thing it just sort of lost the human element became purely a caricature
sw2181A-ms98-a-0044 219.449875 221.769125 does does that make since to you
sw2181A-ms98-a-0045 221.769125 227.606875 [noise]
sw2181A-ms98-a-0046 227.606875 230.717250 yeah yeah did you go with kids though
sw2181A-ms98-a-0047 230.717250 232.404750 did you go with kids
sw2181A-ms98-a-0048 232.404750 234.450125 did you take kids along

sw2181A-ms98-a-0050 236.982375 238.280250 ah
sw2181A-ms98-a-0051 238.280250 248.514125 oh i would have liked to have a kid with me i think preferably someone seven or eight just just to get a sense for you know how how it affected them [laughter]
sw2181A-ms98-a-0052 248.514125 255.775250 especially to come home and you know [laughter] [vocalized-noise] [laughter-if] [laughter-he] [laughter-didn't] [laughter-knock] [laughter-real] [laughter-loudly] [laughter-and] [laughter-clearly] i would have gotten in trouble the next day i'm [laughter-sure] 
sw2181A-ms98-a-0053 255.775250 269.468875 [silence]
sw2181A-ms98-a-0054 269.468875 273.548500 oh Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles huh um-hum
sw2181A-ms98-a-0055 273.548500 275.164250 um-hum
sw2181A-ms98-a-0056 275.164250 276.359250 [silence]
sw2181A-ms98-a-0057 276.359250 278.162875 and your cousin's a kid
sw2181A-ms98-a-0058 278.162875 279.425000 uh-huh
sw2181A-ms98-a-0059 279.425000 284.808625 [silence]
sw2181A-ms98-a-0060 284.808625 287.281375 yeah wasn't it amazing
sw2181A-ms98-a-0061 287.281375 288.730500 [silence]
sw2181A-ms98-a-0062 288.730500 289.816625 yeah those
sw2181A-ms98-a-0063 289.816625 304.372000 yeah it was all bloodless and the good guys can get hit all day long and they have to shake it off they don't they don't you know get [vocalized-noise] epileptic fits or anything from getting hit on the head
sw2181A-ms98-a-0064 304.372000 306.659875 yeah it it's a little disturbing
sw2181A-ms98-a-0065 306.659875 315.148875 the violence in these films part[ly]- it mean it's supposed to be a little bit more okay because it's comic book but on the other hand it makes it seem like
sw2181A-ms98-a-0066 315.148875 326.731000 i i read an article one time talking about even the [vocalized-noise] the quote unquote realistic movies don't have very realistic effects of the violence the violence can seem very realistic but the aftermath is usually not there 
sw2181A-ms98-a-0067 326.731000 329.536000 if you see people who are severely injured it's
sw2181A-ms98-a-0068 329.536000 344.401375 very very badly they lose control of body functions they thrash around they scream you know uh it's just a very very bad thing and they never present that even the movies that want to show violence as real they don't really show you what happens with that real violence
sw2181A-ms98-a-0069 344.401375 348.399500 and i'm not really sure how i feel about that [laughter] 
sw2181A-ms98-a-0070 348.399500 359.918500 uh on the one hand i'd like it to be a warning on the other hand i wouldn't want people who currently get sort of enjoy their violence fixes from these movies to start thinking gee now we want to see the aftermath all the time either
sw2181A-ms98-a-0071 359.918500 364.461375 [silence]
sw2181A-ms98-a-0072 364.461375 377.385750 but yeah T[eenage]- Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is sort of the same way they [vocalized-noise] i guess they figured i mean they know what they're doing and they make the movies good enough i guess i'm a bit of a snob they make the movies good enough to be successful 
sw2181A-ms98-a-0073 377.385750 385.292625 and then they don't and they but they could make them better you know they could try to make i mean as far as i was concerned Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles could have been a classic of world theater
sw2181A-ms98-a-0074 385.292625 397.478125 [vocalized-noise] it could have been you know it was it was innovative it's a it's completely new approach to making a movie in a lot of ways and yet it ended up not being anything particularly memorable 
sw2181A-ms98-a-0075 397.478125 404.614125 cause the the story was stupid and and then things like that and uh they built up i remember feeling annoyed
sw2181A-ms98-a-0076 404.614125 406.726500 again i didn't have a kid with me
sw2181A-ms98-a-0077 406.726500 419.696125 and i remember feeling annoyed that they had this whole thing about the master and the passing of wisdom the from older to younger generation it was it was a classic Greek you know it's European mess going back three thousand years that they're playing with
sw2181A-ms98-a-0078 419.696125 426.573375 um and he had to pa[st]- and he told them remember [vocalized-noise] remember you
sw2181A-ms98-a-0079 426.573375 434.981125 [vocalized-noise] united you can succeed individually you will fail and then there was a big climactic fight scene and they didn't remember that
sw2181A-ms98-a-0080 434.981125 440.960375 they didn't fight together they fought individually and they failed individually and then that was it then they had to have the master beat him
sw2181A-ms98-a-0081 440.960375 447.342000 and the master should according to the classic myth the sort of Joseph Campbell type myth
sw2181A-ms98-a-0082 447.342000 458.473125 the master should have died at the end because the the lesson was passed to the young generation and the older generation is not needed and is reborn to the younger generation and on and on and on and all this wonderful myth
sw2181A-ms98-a-0083 458.473125 463.162000 and it still would have been every bit as accessible a movie for the kids
sw2181A-ms98-a-0084 463.162000 466.445750 if they had included all this stuff that
sw2181A-ms98-a-0085 466.445750 473.592750 i anyway as an as intellectual adult would appreciate it wouldn't have hurt the movie to do that [vocalized-noise] and it would have make it uh 
sw2181A-ms98-a-0086 473.592750 477.327250 broadened the audience that it could have been targeted for i thought
sw2181A-ms98-a-0087 477.327250 486.657625 but i um i'm i'm clearly enough you know i'm i'm clearly an intellectual snob to be going to these kinds of movies i realize that
sw2181A-ms98-a-0088 486.657625 493.113875 i mean to go to these movies and expect them to be you know other than just just good entertainment kind of thing
sw2181A-ms98-a-0089 493.113875 501.500500 [silence]
sw2181A-ms98-a-0090 501.500500 511.572500 yeah yeah i i i i'm very i'm very critical [noise] i i i'm actually originally from Hollywood and then then then and my my father works in films and such and i tend to 
sw2181A-ms98-a-0091 511.572500 520.211000 tend to be hypercritical of these things and then perhaps perhaps it's unfair because i i i must admit i enjoy these movies um
sw2181A-ms98-a-0092 520.211000 522.636750 and th[at]- that's what they're for
sw2181A-ms98-a-0093 522.636750 524.541750 but i don't i don't remember them 
sw2181A-ms98-a-0094 524.541750 534.730625 and i think it's i think i can think of movies i have less fun during and then after the movie's over i remember it so terribly well because it it had some some meaning to me or something
sw2181A-ms98-a-0095 534.730625 542.228000 [silence]
sw2181A-ms98-a-0096 542.228000 543.629375 um-hum

sw2181A-ms98-a-0099 547.473625 552.528625 yeah they leave they leave some songs with you they leave i don't know what it is
sw2181A-ms98-a-0100 552.528625 554.234625 but it just
sw2181A-ms98-a-0101 554.234625 566.231250 i mean i don't know if this is old fart talking here or something because_1 i'm not that old [laughter] [laughter-i] [laughter-look] you know those old movies seemed to have had something that uh that was memorable somehow i don't know what it was
sw2181A-ms98-a-0102 566.231250 569.790750 [silence]
sw2181A-ms98-a-0103 569.790750 576.651000 okay well um [laughter] thanks for hearing me ramp i guess [laughter] all right nice talking with you
