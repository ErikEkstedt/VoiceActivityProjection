sw2121A-ms98-a-0002 1.605000 7.776250 [noise] okay uh could you tell me what you think contributes most to uh air pollution
sw2121A-ms98-a-0003 7.776250 30.492250 [silence]
sw2121A-ms98-a-0004 30.492250 33.617125 [noise] um well

sw2121A-ms98-a-0006 42.537750 49.511500 uh put into the atmosphere [noise] i think probably the greatest cause is uh
sw2121A-ms98-a-0007 49.511500 51.643750 [noise] vehicles
sw2121A-ms98-a-0008 51.643750 57.470875 especially around cities um uh do you live right in the city itself

sw2121A-ms98-a-0014 85.623250 98.428375 where TI's plant is but there isn't a lot of heavy industry there's the freeways and we get an occasional w[ell]- it depends which way the wind's blowing from Boston because we're only like about forty miles south of Boston so we'll pick up that
sw2121A-ms98-a-0015 98.428375 101.134500 and uh i've noticed
sw2121A-ms98-a-0016 101.134500 106.596500 over the past say maybe five or six years uh we live
sw2121A-ms98-a-0017 106.596500 118.535125 about twenty miles away from the state airport and i notice the fly patterns now of the jets are they getting bigger they're swinging wider so that now they're coming over the over the our homes [noise]
sw2121A-ms98-a-0018 118.535125 125.975000 and it seems like uh um we're catching all their residue i'm not sure if it's kerosene or what that's dropping
sw2121A-ms98-a-0019 125.975000 134.132500 but other than that you know we don't have the unless we're catching it from the midwest the emissions [noise] -[y]eah from the power plants
sw2121A-ms98-a-0020 134.132500 135.777125 um
sw2121A-ms98-a-0021 135.777125 146.905875 [noise] yeah yeah we generate one of ou[r]- ou[r]- biggest electrical plants in Rhode Island uses coal to uh generate electricity um
sw2121A-ms98-a-0022 146.905875 151.966875 there doesn't seem to be much emission from them but i'm not sure about the rest of the country
sw2121A-ms98-a-0023 151.966875 166.728750 [silence]
sw2121A-ms98-a-0024 166.728750 169.995625 [laughter] is that right [laughter]

sw2121A-ms98-a-0030 202.617375 212.442500 the boilerhouse for powerhouses and they do that at night too because employees been complaining that the cars have been pitted and you know spots all over them_1
sw2121A-ms98-a-0031 212.442500 215.541625 so you're right they could do something a[bout]- about that i guess
sw2121A-ms98-a-0032 215.541625 216.559875 [silence]
sw2121A-ms98-a-0033 216.559875 218.998250 [noise] how are your uh

sw2121A-ms98-a-0037 233.073625 236.916625 acid rain yeah that's that's what i was uh

sw2121A-ms98-a-0039 252.624750 260.358125 yeah no didn't they just have an article oh on uh [noise] they were dumping lime up upstate New York somewhere 
sw2121A-ms98-a-0040 260.358125 272.970000 um over over huge areas and and they thought that was more beneficial because you know and it some of it does soak in and some of it runs off right away into the into the streams and rivers and some of the fish were supposedly making a comeback
sw2121A-ms98-a-0041 272.970000 274.545375 [silence]
sw2121A-ms98-a-0042 274.545375 284.185125 i can't remember where i i read that recently somewhere and i can't remember where but i thought it was up there [noise] so that's interesting because New Hampshire
sw2121A-ms98-a-0043 284.185125 293.740625 [noise] and parts of Vermont um they showed pictures of of extensive tree damage that they attributed to acid rain [noise] um
sw2121A-ms98-a-0044 293.740625 296.163250 do you kind of think it's something else then
sw2121A-ms98-a-0045 296.163250 299.021750 [silence]
sw2121A-ms98-a-0046 299.021750 303.903000 oh they didn't say they didn't say what though they just said they thought it was

sw2121A-ms98-a-0052 330.638750 340.465750 uh we can demand uh more efficient automobiles for one thing i still think that's that's uh one of our major causes of pollutants
sw2121A-ms98-a-0053 340.465750 347.063750 [noise] uh how we go about that it's uh uh it's a little bit difficult
sw2121A-ms98-a-0054 347.063750 349.607375 [silence]
sw2121A-ms98-a-0055 349.607375 356.156250 yeah you n[eed]- you n[eed]- i think you need a a uh vehicle something like uh
sw2121A-ms98-a-0056 356.156250 367.314250 uh Ralph Nader uh Nader's Raiders or uh where uh [noise] or uh [noise] uh AARP
sw2121A-ms98-a-0057 367.314250 372.970000 which has a lot of members uh if you can get those types of groups

sw2121A-ms98-a-0062 394.494500 397.581000 smoke or uh or
sw2121A-ms98-a-0063 397.581000 399.812375 uh
sw2121A-ms98-a-0064 399.812375 407.307750 i'm not really sure you think that that the uh the trucking indus[try]- uh industry is that uh incompetent that they wouldn't
sw2121A-ms98-a-0065 407.307750 410.708500 you know fuel is is one of their biggest costs
sw2121A-ms98-a-0066 410.708500 412.559750 so you would
sw2121A-ms98-a-0067 412.559750 414.962625 yeah diesel engines
sw2121A-ms98-a-0068 414.962625 419.371125 [silence]
sw2121A-ms98-a-0069 419.371125 420.908250 yeah
sw2121A-ms98-a-0070 420.908250 429.266125 [noise] yeah we could also uh push for legislation for uh rapid transit systems uh this country seems to be a little behind on that
sw2121A-ms98-a-0071 429.266125 434.524125 [silence]
sw2121A-ms98-a-0072 434.524125 436.295750 hm

sw2121A-ms98-a-0074 437.377625 441.784125 yeah but only because we got used to [noise] uh
sw2121A-ms98-a-0075 441.784125 447.019375 single person single car driving a lot of people don't even like to carpool
sw2121A-ms98-a-0076 447.019375 449.164125 but we could do that that'll help
sw2121A-ms98-a-0077 449.164125 452.035125 pollution air pollution [noise]
sw2121A-ms98-a-0078 452.035125 462.260125 the uh United States and Canada are i guess is is uh it going into uh some types of agreements to limit uh what's being given out by power plants
sw2121A-ms98-a-0079 462.260125 466.886125 i guess Canada's quite concerned that we're sending a lot of our stuff up there
sw2121A-ms98-a-0080 466.886125 469.138625 so that's helping
sw2121A-ms98-a-0081 469.138625 477.727125 [silence]
sw2121A-ms98-a-0082 477.727125 479.857625 now that's an idea
sw2121A-ms98-a-0083 479.857625 489.109875 don't say that too loud though because_1 uh every city and town will have a meter on your [laughter] [laughter-tailpipe] generate [noise] generate revenue
sw2121A-ms98-a-0084 489.109875 502.724250 [silence]
sw2121A-ms98-a-0085 502.724250 507.103125 that's a that's an interesting concept is that your idea
sw2121A-ms98-a-0086 507.103125 517.249500 [silence]
sw2121A-ms98-a-0087 517.249500 525.949750 well i was gonna to say right you could put it in you c[ould]- you could it could be installed like a catalytic converter i mean i guess you could take those off too but
sw2121A-ms98-a-0088 525.949750 527.765875 [silence]
sw2121A-ms98-a-0089 527.765875 533.499500 yeah if you can take a muffler off and only replace well not unless it was built into every muffler
sw2121A-ms98-a-0090 533.499500 535.477125 and that's [vocalized-noise]

sw2121A-ms98-a-0094 548.345875 550.923000 that's a that's quite a concept
sw2121A-ms98-a-0095 550.923000 556.726125 you should uh pursue that i think or patent it [laughter] you know
sw2121A-ms98-a-0096 556.726125 559.997000 if you could come up with a device that's the thing
sw2121A-ms98-a-0097 559.997000 569.668875 but it shouldn't be too hard to do something like that but that's a that's a thought no you're right and that will solve uh a lot of problems i don't know if you uh
sw2121A-ms98-a-0098 569.668875 575.598750 if you approached the automobile industry if they would be too keen on installing something like that
sw2121A-ms98-a-0099 575.598750 577.667375 uh but
sw2121A-ms98-a-0100 577.667375 581.349500 you know a proposal to uh uh
sw2121A-ms98-a-0101 581.349500 583.012375 [silence]
sw2121A-ms98-a-0102 583.012375 589.405125 i guess the proper authorities well you might uh generate some
sw2121A-ms98-a-0103 589.405125 600.256000 yeah you might generate some interest in it but that's a that's a good idea other than that i'm not sure what what individuals can do other than like i said get involved through a group or an organization
