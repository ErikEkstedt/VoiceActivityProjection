sw2121B-ms98-a-0002 7.660500 19.260125 well it's hard to say i mean while it's certainly the case that things like automobiles and factories uh pollute a lot um if you
sw2121B-ms98-a-0003 19.260125 29.224250 look at how much pollution is say kicked up by an active volcano uh it's certainly less than clear that anything man can do in this sort of scale of things has much effect at all

sw2121B-ms98-a-0029 151.389625 163.181500 yeah i've noticed locally a major problem is Kodak um it's interesting because in order to uh keep with the EPA standards which which tend to be visible
sw2121B-ms98-a-0030 163.181500 168.368875 uh what's coming out of your [noise] smokestack they do all their emissions at night uh so people get up
sw2121B-ms98-a-0031 168.368875 176.064625 yeah people get up in the morning in that neighborhood and they've got this black ash on their cars [laughter] [laughter-which] you know seems to be

sw2121B-ms98-a-0033 177.106750 187.165000 yeah i mean i [laughter-really] think if the EPA had anything on the ball they'd go in there with a few phosphorous grenades light up the sky photograph the emissions at that point and uh

sw2121B-ms98-a-0050 227.522625 235.685750 yeah i'm not sure how much the water pollution is is directly related to the air pollution other than acid rain yeah
sw2121B-ms98-a-0051 235.685750 241.768625 i mean the stuff i've read recently in Technology Review basically indicates that acid rain may be a little bit
sw2121B-ms98-a-0052 241.768625 252.833875 um overstated that a lot of the die off they've seen in forests may not really be due to acid rain at all um yeah i'm not an expert

sw2121B-ms98-a-0067 296.434875 301.583000 well that's what the environmentalists were claiming in this article so that
sw2121B-ms98-a-0068 301.583000 310.757000 they didn't say what they just said they thought acid rain's contribution may be less than was previously suspected um but it may be other natural things at work

sw2121B-ms98-a-0071 313.617500 319.354500 yeah so it's it's less than clear like i said i don't remember the article that well
sw2121B-ms98-a-0072 319.354500 328.995375 but um i don't know i mean what do you think we can uh i guess as individuals or as a group do about uh air pollution

sw2121B-ms98-a-0076 345.446750 352.868500 so you think it's just up to individuals to ask automakers for uh [noise] less polluting vehicles

sw2121B-ms98-a-0082 372.117625 374.710250 do you really think new vehicles though is a
sw2121B-ms98-a-0083 374.710250 388.453000 big problem i mean i remember reading an article that said like it's the older polluters the the twelve and the fifteen year old cars you know contribute like ninety percent of the automobile pollution and the new cars it's hardly it's hardly anything
sw2121B-ms98-a-0084 388.453000 395.590125 [silence]
sw2121B-ms98-a-0085 395.590125 398.327125 yeah but doesn't that just mean they're out of tune

sw2121B-ms98-a-0089 413.578000 420.381125 i[t]- you know it's it i mean they do generate a lot of soot but that at least you know that kind of particulate comes out of the air pretty quickly

sw2121B-ms98-a-0102 468.827000 475.334000 well what do you think about like a device a meter o[n]- right on a tailpipe and you paid a tax based on how much you polluted
sw2121B-ms98-a-0103 475.334000 485.113000 [silence]
sw2121B-ms98-a-0104 485.113000 495.987375 well it just means that if you don't pollute right or you pollute very little you don't have to pay any tax or you just buy one of these things and it it um i mean you could you could probably devise them_1 so that it slowly closed off your tail pipe
sw2121B-ms98-a-0105 495.987375 503.753875 [noise] and uh the less you pollute the longer the device lasts and if you pollute a lot then it closed off your tailpipe and you couldn't start your car anymore [noise]

sw2121B-ms98-a-0107 507.004000 511.198250 yeah but uh you know [noise] it's uh
sw2121B-ms98-a-0108 511.198250 519.307750 i guess the difficulty would be to [vocalized-noise] somebody could obviously just take it right off the tailpipe again so you'd probably have to build it right into the muffler or something [noise]

sw2121B-ms98-a-0111 524.677375 528.989000 you could take catalytic but mufflers would be a little more obvious if you took that off

sw2121B-ms98-a-0113 532.866375 534.210000 right
sw2121B-ms98-a-0114 534.210000 542.047250 but if you were -[ju]st talking about something which was more or less universal that uh buses and any kind of vehicle had to pay a pollution tax
sw2121B-ms98-a-0115 542.047250 547.572750 um this would penalize the heavy polluters and not penalize the light polluters
