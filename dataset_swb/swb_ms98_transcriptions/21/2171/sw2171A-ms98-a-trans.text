sw2171A-ms98-a-0029 125.142625 131.843625 well it sounded like i mean this is like maj[or]- long term commitment like a year or six months or
sw2171A-ms98-a-0030 131.843625 138.322250 so you're looking at the Peace Corps or sabbatical maybe or you know i don't know i mean but uh

sw2171A-ms98-a-0034 150.842000 157.022125 but that that time is minuscule compared to what what it sound like they were referring to
sw2171A-ms98-a-0035 157.022125 162.507250 [silence]
sw2171A-ms98-a-0036 162.507250 166.214750 yeah yeah they couldn't cover my hourly rate

sw2171A-ms98-a-0040 170.164875 171.648000 but uh
sw2171A-ms98-a-0041 171.648000 176.889625 [silence]
sw2171A-ms98-a-0042 176.889625 178.791250 yeah Africa

sw2171A-ms98-a-0044 187.871000 192.354250 yeah well i doubt that but you know i guess
sw2171A-ms98-a-0045 192.354250 197.757250 well i i mean it would it would have to be tough going somewhere you don't know
sw2171A-ms98-a-0046 197.757250 198.888250 [silence]
sw2171A-ms98-a-0047 198.888250 204.418875 the culture usually i guess i think that maybe that's why some people do it is
sw2171A-ms98-a-0048 204.418875 211.018875 uh to see the other cultures or you know and some of that but
sw2171A-ms98-a-0049 211.018875 214.749000 uh to do that i don't know i'd have to be
sw2171A-ms98-a-0050 214.749000 216.353750 [silence]
sw2171A-ms98-a-0051 216.353750 217.617375 i don't know
sw2171A-ms98-a-0052 217.617375 218.435250 oh
sw2171A-ms98-a-0053 218.435250 233.211375 [silence]
sw2171A-ms98-a-0054 233.211375 240.982250 um-hum well you know uh i know American Expre[ss]- i'm no[w]- i'm working at American Express now and they
sw2171A-ms98-a-0055 240.982250 248.081750 after a certain amount of years of service these employees can take off
sw2171A-ms98-a-0056 248.081750 254.667875 like six months or something for some type of sabbatical or some you know some something like that
sw2171A-ms98-a-0057 254.667875 256.239250 and
sw2171A-ms98-a-0058 256.239250 261.337125 they're allowed to take that time off and then come back where they left off
sw2171A-ms98-a-0059 261.337125 265.585375 so it is something that i think
sw2171A-ms98-a-0060 265.585375 266.978875 uh
sw2171A-ms98-a-0061 266.978875 271.536875 you know even the larger organizations will support uh
sw2171A-ms98-a-0062 271.536875 277.704375 it's r[eally]- it's really for the community to give you know to to give back to the community type of thing
sw2171A-ms98-a-0063 277.704375 279.171500 i don't know
sw2171A-ms98-a-0064 279.171500 283.681125 pre[tty]- it's for yeah i think at the same time it's for some people to 
sw2171A-ms98-a-0065 283.681125 286.597500 you know help them grow in other areas

sw2171A-ms98-a-0072 303.717375 307.147875 yeah maybe a little bit in that perspective but uh
sw2171A-ms98-a-0073 307.147875 312.735625 i know a lot of people that have gone in the military i mean i[n]- you know when they're in the college
sw2171A-ms98-a-0074 312.735625 316.599875 sometimes it's to su[pport]- help support college you know the money
sw2171A-ms98-a-0075 316.599875 320.040500 uh others people don't know what they want to do
sw2171A-ms98-a-0076 320.040500 322.385750 but as far as uh
sw2171A-ms98-a-0077 322.385750 324.338000 you know the Peace Corps
sw2171A-ms98-a-0078 324.338000 329.776000 i guess i suppose there's a few people that have done it at that point in their lives
sw2171A-ms98-a-0079 329.776000 335.020500 but i think a lot of it's you know when the people get older they'll do something like that
sw2171A-ms98-a-0080 335.020500 339.736500 [silence]
