sw2158A-ms98-a-0064 259.577125 261.143000 well
sw2158A-ms98-a-0065 261.143000 267.102500 because how how hot i mean like like in the coldest that it gets in winter down there how much is it
sw2158A-ms98-a-0066 267.102500 281.103875 [silence]
sw2158A-ms98-a-0067 281.103875 283.577375 yeah yeah that's
sw2158A-ms98-a-0068 283.577375 291.087375 [silence]
sw2158A-ms98-a-0069 291.087375 303.604500 well it's basically you know it's like i got like a leather jacket or a you know so i just put on a T-shirt and a leather jacket and i usually stay in class that way and if not i would wear a sweatshirt underneath it
sw2158A-ms98-a-0070 303.604500 317.517250 and then you know you'd but what happens is uh what i've seen here on campus it's very strange because a lot of black people here they wear like dress pants and dress shirts to go everywhere
sw2158A-ms98-a-0071 317.517250 319.099625 okay
sw2158A-ms98-a-0072 319.099625 324.767750 and they wear either that or they wear dress pants and black turtlenecks or white turtlenecks
sw2158A-ms98-a-0073 324.767750 335.199250 and so the thing is you know is like i asked a guy you know why why do you wear that he goes well it costs me the same amount which is true because some dress pants you know cost me twenty five dollars which is the same as jeans
sw2158A-ms98-a-0074 335.199250 347.623125 but um but basically all over here everywhere everybody [noise] wears jeans and if not [noise] what the [noise] what the thing is that they're wearing now is sometimes you wear like shorts with biker pants underneath it
sw2158A-ms98-a-0075 347.623125 349.123125 which is
sw2158A-ms98-a-0076 349.123125 377.706000 [silence]

sw2158A-ms98-a-0121 557.186750 561.844500 they give you shirts right which which you use and then you take back they give you a clean one
sw2158A-ms98-a-0122 561.844500 571.550250 and so sometimes you wear you know the shirts from from the gym everyday of the week the only thing is that you can tell them apart because they have the year that they were bought in
sw2158A-ms98-a-0123 571.550250 584.610500 so i mean you don't feel as bad because it's like they they give you different year sometime you know so you're wearing you know sometimes you're wearing eighty nine the other times you're wearing ninety one the other times you're wearing you know eighty six so it's okay you [laughter-know]
