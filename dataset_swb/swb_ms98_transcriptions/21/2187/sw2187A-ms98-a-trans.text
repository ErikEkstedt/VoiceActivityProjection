sw2187A-ms98-a-0002 0.998875 3.497500 okay okay
sw2187A-ms98-a-0003 3.497500 14.977250 um yeah that's what it said to discuss some maybe a recipe well it says why would you what you would have for a dinner party um this is strange because i pressed one and i thought it said begin
sw2187A-ms98-a-0004 14.977250 29.499625 [vocalized-noise] okay maybe maybe we're all set okay we'll talk for five minutes they interrupt at the end um yeah it says what you would have for a dinner party i just happen to plan one out for Saturday i'll tell you what i'm going to have um 
sw2187A-ms98-a-0005 29.499625 35.771625 i can find it well i have this new fondue pot and i was going to do basic cheese fondue
sw2187A-ms98-a-0006 35.771625 47.226750 and i have two different kinds of breads and some ham and i was going to try something weird which you know when you have fish au gratin i was going to make some uh like
sw2187A-ms98-a-0007 47.226750 52.989000 fish chunks and dip it in the fondue i don't know if it will come out
sw2187A-ms98-a-0008 52.989000 54.204750 [silence]
sw2187A-ms98-a-0009 54.204750 63.989000 yeah the cheese fondue i make some people like Swiss um i prefer cheddar and i'll mix i won't make i won't have a sharp cheddar because_1 
sw2187A-ms98-a-0010 63.989000 72.155750 [vocalized-noise] for fondue i think it should be a little calmer than real sharp cheddar and then i was going to make other things like potato skins 
sw2187A-ms98-a-0011 72.155750 80.235875 it see you don't necessarily have to dip this stuff and um i was going to have broccoli and cauliflower for a a vegetable
sw2187A-ms98-a-0012 80.235875 87.668000 [silence]
sw2187A-ms98-a-0013 87.668000 92.208125 oh yeah it's amazing how vegetables trays will go at a party
sw2187A-ms98-a-0014 92.208125 93.711250 uh
sw2187A-ms98-a-0015 93.711250 95.722750 [silence]
sw2187A-ms98-a-0016 95.722750 99.493000 yeah instead of something greasy or
sw2187A-ms98-a-0017 99.493000 101.999875 uh uh no um my uh
sw2187A-ms98-a-0018 101.999875 110.746500 girlfriend's do catering and they always about every party they do is they have a vegetable tray i think they try and suggest it
sw2187A-ms98-a-0019 110.746500 121.951375 what i've been doing when i get invited someplace and bring something i make uh food kebabs You take little toothpicks and cut up uh pineapple and strawberry
sw2187A-ms98-a-0020 121.951375 129.455500 even banana if you can do it just before you leave it stays nice and fresh
sw2187A-ms98-a-0021 129.455500 133.983750 [silence]
sw2187A-ms98-a-0022 133.983750 135.741125 yeah
sw2187A-ms98-a-0023 135.741125 136.760750 [silence]
sw2187A-ms98-a-0024 136.760750 150.987500 yeah i like those [laughter] um they they made a couple of those uh they made one for my uh bridal shower and i was pretty pleased i never made one for myself though but they look easy enough to make it's not
sw2187A-ms98-a-0025 150.987500 152.986375 [silence]
sw2187A-ms98-a-0026 152.986375 154.996625 yeah
sw2187A-ms98-a-0027 154.996625 162.993750 [silence]
sw2187A-ms98-a-0028 162.993750 173.463375 yeah you probably get this probably pretty sticky after you get done then you've got to drain the water out of the watermelon because you know when you scrape it it makes the water
sw2187A-ms98-a-0029 173.463375 182.496000 yeah um something i do is a fruit is i'll get um make chocolate sauce and dip strawberries and bananas in them
sw2187A-ms98-a-0030 182.496000 191.699250 yeah i have two nieces and they they [vocalized-noise] come over to my house they go melt some chocolate chips [laughter] go buy me some strawberries [laughter] 
sw2187A-ms98-a-0031 191.699250 196.766375 [silence]
sw2187A-ms98-a-0032 196.766375 202.208625 yeah they're you know if you get a sweet strawberry they're much better but if you get a sour strawberry
sw2187A-ms98-a-0033 202.208625 212.610625 huh yeah no they um the strawberries are coming in season now from they're they're coming up from Florida of course i live in Vermont so
sw2187A-ms98-a-0034 212.610625 217.235625 but they're really reasonably priced they're coming up from Florida so
sw2187A-ms98-a-0035 217.235625 219.805750 [silence]
sw2187A-ms98-a-0036 219.805750 221.784125 yeah
sw2187A-ms98-a-0037 221.784125 225.483125 [silence]
sw2187A-ms98-a-0038 225.483125 231.117250 yeah i think the uh actually i think they get um some of them from South America
sw2187A-ms98-a-0039 231.117250 239.755750 yep they a lot of um oh of uh winter produce comes from South America of course their seasons are switched 
sw2187A-ms98-a-0040 239.755750 247.995250 so um do you want to discuss your recipe i have a recipe if you want [laughter] um it filled
sw2187A-ms98-a-0041 247.995250 260.996875 a lot of people try to stay away from this but i make my own homemade pudding just because i don't like box pudding yeah it and it if you if you um well first of all i star[t]- 
sw2187A-ms98-a-0042 260.996875 267.859125 take about a quarter and a half of milk and i put it in a two quart saucepan and you put it on a really low heat
sw2187A-ms98-a-0043 267.859125 273.830875 [vocalized-noise] and you want to use one of your good sauce pans that dissipate the heat because it it ends up burning 
sw2187A-ms98-a-0044 273.830875 286.751000 i mean no matter how careful you are you still might get a film on the bottom of the pot i don't let that worry me and i get the milk lukewarm and then i pour about a half a cup of cornstarch in it and i have this thing it's called the slender blender
sw2187A-ms98-a-0045 286.751000 299.679000 it it makes the uh it makes uh [noise] a whip topping out of milk if you get the milk cold enough it's uh i don't know they're called {moogoo} leaves or something [vocalized-noise] they're 
sw2187A-ms98-a-0046 299.679000 312.766000 yeah they're real neat i think they're real reasonably priced some of them they used to be a hundred dollars and they used to whip skim milk into a dessert but i didn't get that one i got the Black and Decker kind but uh
sw2187A-ms98-a-0047 312.766000 324.563250 it's real handy because it doesn't have a cord and you beat this cornstarch right into the mil[k]- the milk you know and it does an excellent job or just hand beat it i guess you could use a hand mixer but
sw2187A-ms98-a-0048 324.563250 339.211375 i don't think it pure i don't think it gets it good enough and then before the milk gets too hot um i add two beaten eggs and i really mix them in good and then about a half a cup of sugar
sw2187A-ms98-a-0049 339.211375 349.609000 and i let it pretty much i beat it like every minute for about ten seconds and it's it starts thickening when it thickens the cornstarch might get a little
sw2187A-ms98-a-0050 349.609000 359.998000 i don't know it gets like little globs of this rubbery cornstarch and you just keep beating it in and it's the the trick is is to have this blender
sw2187A-ms98-a-0051 359.998000 370.859500 so if you were you'd have to probably almost go out and someone who's just going to make it first time it's you'll have much better luck if you had one of these little blenders
sw2187A-ms98-a-0052 370.859500 382.675875 and then you can add cocoa powder to it to make chocolate or after it's thickened i cook it for a good once it starts boiling i just i cook it for a good seven minutes
sw2187A-ms98-a-0053 382.675875 388.499125 seven to ten minutes and then you can make chocolate or you can take it off
sw2187A-ms98-a-0054 388.499125 398.809625 and when it cools a little they you put um really good vanilla favoring in it and some butter and that makes French vanilla um custard 
sw2187A-ms98-a-0055 398.809625 400.443000 yeah
sw2187A-ms98-a-0056 400.443000 403.759500 [silence]
sw2187A-ms98-a-0057 403.759500 412.971000 a chocolate powder yeah that cocoa yeah the unsweetened it comes in like a real dark can our mothers used to use it and then
sw2187A-ms98-a-0058 412.971000 422.983125 yeah we all used to yeah it's the unsweetened kind it's not like Nestle Quik i suppose you could use that i- yeah but um
sw2187A-ms98-a-0059 422.983125 424.311000 i-
sw2187A-ms98-a-0060 424.311000 425.999875 [silence]
sw2187A-ms98-a-0061 425.999875 431.973875 well i used to make the regular pudding the chocolate and put it in the pie shell
sw2187A-ms98-a-0062 431.973875 441.493750 and if it would sit in the refrigerator for a day where you cut the pie it would soak into the pie shell and it was like red [laughter] and i'm like oh this is kind of {groedy} 
sw2187A-ms98-a-0063 441.493750 443.730625 [silence]
sw2187A-ms98-a-0064 443.730625 452.485375 um no actually i found it in one of my mother's um homemade cookbooks i mean something she had collected out of Woman's Day or something
sw2187A-ms98-a-0065 452.485375 453.999125 so
sw2187A-ms98-a-0066 453.999125 460.658500 i think you couldn't make it with a hand whisk or or a regular beater but um
sw2187A-ms98-a-0067 460.658500 463.486125 [silence]
sw2187A-ms98-a-0068 463.486125 470.948250 yeah but i still think a beater would do it good enough um the trick is to get the cornstarch
sw2187A-ms98-a-0069 470.948250 483.431875 um yeah right in the in the lukewarm milk sometimes i put the cornstarch in a separate bowl and i would put it in the sink and i'll take my lukewarm milk and put it in the cornstarch
sw2187A-ms98-a-0070 483.431875 494.608125 and beat it good it seems to be better than putting the the cornstarch into the liquid it once it hits the top of the liquid it seems to make little balls and stuff on the top
sw2187A-ms98-a-0071 494.608125 495.768625 [silence]
sw2187A-ms98-a-0072 495.768625 500.310000 yeah and i'll do this uh sometimes i'll put my after I
sw2187A-ms98-a-0073 500.310000 511.265125 pour that into my back into my saucepan i'll put the eggs in the same dish and beat them up and then pour the cornstarch and the milk mixture in the egg so
sw2187A-ms98-a-0074 511.265125 522.133000 yep and then you know if if y[ou]- you can put your cocoa in with your cornstarch if you wanted to the cocoa even seems to thicken it even more 
sw2187A-ms98-a-0075 522.133000 532.368875 because by the vanilla doesn't seem to thicken as well as the sometimes the cocoa is like my husband really likes it thick he says i can stick the spoon right in this
sw2187A-ms98-a-0076 532.368875 543.303625 because i'm always worrying it won't firm up because it when you take it out of the saucepan it's like boy i hope this thickens a little more because it's not like real
sw2187A-ms98-a-0077 543.303625 548.641375 package thick you know when you cook a package it's it's a little less
sw2187A-ms98-a-0078 548.641375 559.956375 but i put it in a nice glass bowl and um some people don't like that [noise] that film on the pudding so you can put uh Saran Wrap over the top 
sw2187A-ms98-a-0079 559.956375 573.469875 and then once the pudding starts cooling it makes little balls of water on the Saran Wrap so when you pull the Saran Wrap back you sort of should be a little careful pull it back and shake the water off the Saran Wrap and i might put it back on but um
sw2187A-ms98-a-0080 573.469875 574.991625 [silence]
sw2187A-ms98-a-0081 574.991625 581.481125 yeah after well when it starts steaming a lot uh i definitely yeah put it in the refrigerator
sw2187A-ms98-a-0082 581.481125 592.138750 but um [vocalized-noise] i my father always told me if you put hot food in your refrigerator you're going to make it work too hard that's yeah [laughter-so] that's why i do that 
sw2187A-ms98-a-0083 592.138750 598.446375 so well i don't know that's my my great hard recipe [laughter]
