sw2195A-ms98-a-0004 12.030000 13.022000 [silence]
sw2195A-ms98-a-0005 13.022000 14.332625 um
sw2195A-ms98-a-0006 14.332625 21.146750 i think one of the facets of living in a small town is that often times
sw2195A-ms98-a-0007 21.146750 31.448000 you are uh sitting in on a jury trial where you might be acquainted with at least maybe not that person but part of their family
sw2195A-ms98-a-0008 31.448000 35.631125 [silence]
sw2195A-ms98-a-0009 35.631125 37.804375 i would think so
sw2195A-ms98-a-0010 37.804375 65.684625 [silence]
sw2195A-ms98-a-0011 65.684625 67.449625 yes i have
sw2195A-ms98-a-0012 67.449625 68.820250 [silence]
sw2195A-ms98-a-0013 68.820250 70.771375 i did t[o]- yes
sw2195A-ms98-a-0014 70.771375 76.835625 [silence]
sw2195A-ms98-a-0015 76.835625 78.207750 um
sw2195A-ms98-a-0016 78.207750 79.421000 [silence]
sw2195A-ms98-a-0017 79.421000 82.623500 uh the last trial i sat on
sw2195A-ms98-a-0018 82.623500 88.166250 at the end of the session the prosecuting attorney called us into a private room
sw2195A-ms98-a-0019 88.166250 96.041875 and more or less instructed us to find her not guilty because even though they knew
sw2195A-ms98-a-0020 96.041875 109.481625 and they proved that she had set fire to her car in order to collect the insurance money that would we find her guilty she would simply flee the state and avoid any prosecution of any kind whatsoever
sw2195A-ms98-a-0021 109.481625 116.520625 which we did find her guilty against his instruction and she did flee the state
sw2195A-ms98-a-0022 116.520625 118.358250 but [laughter]
sw2195A-ms98-a-0023 118.358250 119.398500 [silence]
sw2195A-ms98-a-0024 119.398500 122.720250 but she was guilty and
sw2195A-ms98-a-0025 122.720250 126.922500 we just didn't understand why he was doing that
sw2195A-ms98-a-0026 126.922500 133.510875 [silence]
sw2195A-ms98-a-0027 133.510875 139.203375 my husband sat in on a jury trial a murder trial that lasted for two weeks
sw2195A-ms98-a-0028 139.203375 152.265250 that left him uh i mean in the very beginning he was convinced that the person was not guilty and at the end of their deliberations he finally voted uh
sw2195A-ms98-a-0029 152.265250 154.655625 guilty uh
sw2195A-ms98-a-0030 154.655625 161.503875 which surprised me that that uh through the jury discussion they were able to convince him
sw2195A-ms98-a-0031 161.503875 166.563875 against his original opinion so maybe that speaks well for juries
sw2195A-ms98-a-0032 166.563875 195.981000 [silence]
sw2195A-ms98-a-0033 195.981000 198.490000 that doesn't seem fair does it
sw2195A-ms98-a-0034 198.490000 206.853125 [silence]
sw2195A-ms98-a-0035 206.853125 208.201750 uh-huh
sw2195A-ms98-a-0036 208.201750 213.890375 [silence]
sw2195A-ms98-a-0037 213.890375 215.321250 uh-huh
sw2195A-ms98-a-0038 215.321250 219.071500 [silence]
sw2195A-ms98-a-0039 219.071500 226.740000 the only thing that frightens me about that is the Graylord cases in uh Chicago where so many judges were
sw2195A-ms98-a-0040 226.740000 231.269875 guilty of so much {misjustice} from the bench
sw2195A-ms98-a-0041 231.269875 232.301500 [silence]
sw2195A-ms98-a-0042 232.301500 234.527000 that after all they're
sw2195A-ms98-a-0043 234.527000 236.685750 only people too in that
sw2195A-ms98-a-0044 236.685750 237.698375 [silence]
sw2195A-ms98-a-0045 237.698375 244.198250 they're subject to corruption just like any other human being and they do have a lot of power
sw2195A-ms98-a-0046 244.198250 270.081250 [silence]
sw2195A-ms98-a-0047 270.081250 273.863625 maybe we both agree then that we need to keep juries and
sw2195A-ms98-a-0048 273.863625 276.915375 i think so [laughter]
sw2195A-ms98-a-0049 276.915375 283.175000 i think we've reached a decision [laughter] nice visiting with you [laughter] bye
