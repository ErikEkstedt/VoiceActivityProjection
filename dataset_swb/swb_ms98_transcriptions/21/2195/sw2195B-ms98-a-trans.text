sw2195B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 6.988000 [silence]
sw2195B-ms98-a-0002 6.988000 8.655000 uh-huh
sw2195B-ms98-a-0003 8.655000 10.342750 sure
sw2195B-ms98-a-0004 10.342750 11.652250 [silence]
sw2195B-ms98-a-0005 11.652250 14.731375 okay trial by jury
sw2195B-ms98-a-0006 14.731375 30.515875 [silence]
sw2195B-ms98-a-0007 30.515875 31.688000 uh-huh
sw2195B-ms98-a-0008 31.688000 32.731750 [silence]
sw2195B-ms98-a-0009 32.731750 38.167250 so that might lead you to a biased uh decision perhaps if you were uh-huh
sw2195B-ms98-a-0010 38.167250 47.928750 on the other hand um i don't know if course the judge as all the expertise in that field and he's trained for that and and i'm sure there are certain
sw2195B-ms98-a-0011 47.928750 53.525000 rules that are set down that he goes by uh along the way to make a decision
sw2195B-ms98-a-0012 53.525000 54.593000 but
sw2195B-ms98-a-0013 54.593000 57.624625 perhaps the jury can um
sw2195B-ms98-a-0014 57.624625 63.879875 give their uh input as to what they think need to be done and then maybe he can go from there
sw2195B-ms98-a-0015 63.879875 66.552875 uh have you ever sat on a jury trial
sw2195B-ms98-a-0016 66.552875 69.990250 yeah i have too and i found it real interesting but
sw2195B-ms98-a-0017 69.990250 77.516750 but we weren't given any opportunity to make a decision as to what would happen we just said whether or not we thought the party was guilty
sw2195B-ms98-a-0018 77.516750 79.489125 and he took it from there
sw2195B-ms98-a-0019 79.489125 113.302250 [silence]
sw2195B-ms98-a-0020 113.302250 114.611250 uh-huh
sw2195B-ms98-a-0021 114.611250 117.572125 [silence]
sw2195B-ms98-a-0022 117.572125 119.248125 [laughter]
sw2195B-ms98-a-0023 119.248125 126.063375 [silence]
sw2195B-ms98-a-0024 126.063375 129.673000 uh-huh that would merely make for some
sw2195B-ms98-a-0025 129.673000 132.878375 odd behavior on the on their part
sw2195B-ms98-a-0026 132.878375 138.547500 [silence]
sw2195B-ms98-a-0027 138.547500 139.659750 uh-huh
sw2195B-ms98-a-0028 139.659750 153.193250 [silence]
sw2195B-ms98-a-0029 153.193250 154.492375 uh-huh
sw2195B-ms98-a-0030 154.492375 165.993625 [silence]
sw2195B-ms98-a-0031 165.993625 179.952750 yeah i i remember the one that i sat in on we had quite a problem coming to a conclusion and and we came back with so many people this way and so many that way and the judge told us we couldn't leave until we
sw2195B-ms98-a-0032 179.952750 186.486625 came to a decision and we just could not we were split and he kept us there one evening until seven
sw2195B-ms98-a-0033 186.486625 196.494625 uh and everyone wanted to go home and so they were willing some of them were willing to change their uh decision just to get out of uh out of the jury room
sw2195B-ms98-a-0034 196.494625 197.542875 [silence]
sw2195B-ms98-a-0035 197.542875 204.766125 no and i i couldn't believe they would do that so maybe in a way it should be left up to the judge because uh maybe the jury isn't
sw2195B-ms98-a-0036 204.766125 207.716625 uh going to give them an honest decision
sw2195B-ms98-a-0037 207.716625 211.824250 you know i i don't know i guess if if we had more power
sw2195B-ms98-a-0038 211.824250 214.856375 we're just people off the street so to speak and
sw2195B-ms98-a-0039 214.856375 219.561750 we don't have the uh background to maybe make that decision 
sw2195B-ms98-a-0040 219.561750 230.794250 [silence]
sw2195B-ms98-a-0041 230.794250 232.587125 uh-huh
sw2195B-ms98-a-0042 232.587125 241.689750 [silence]
sw2195B-ms98-a-0043 241.689750 243.437500 uh-huh
sw2195B-ms98-a-0044 243.437500 248.135000 uh-huh it seems uh sometimes it seems uh rather
sw2195B-ms98-a-0045 248.135000 253.596625 i guess rather uh odd that one person would have that deciding factor
sw2195B-ms98-a-0046 253.596625 262.642500 he would be the sole factor uh determining a person's outcome i guess though but the jury still has their input and maybe he goes
sw2195B-ms98-a-0047 262.642500 270.601625 uh has a lot to decide has to decide a lot from what the jury has input to the case too
sw2195B-ms98-a-0048 270.601625 273.013000 [silence]
sw2195B-ms98-a-0049 273.013000 274.576750 i think so
sw2195B-ms98-a-0050 274.576750 278.404125 [laughter] we could go on
sw2195B-ms98-a-0051 278.404125 279.741125 i think we have
sw2195B-ms98-a-0052 279.741125 280.972500 [silence]
sw2195B-ms98-a-0053 280.972500 282.959750 thank you bye-bye
