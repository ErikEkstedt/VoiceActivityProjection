sw2198B-ms98-a-0045 212.997375 222.690000 they said it's supposed to be really weird but because that David Lynch has like a weird style but i didn't think it was really weird you know not as weird as i don't know i we also
sw2198B-ms98-a-0046 222.690000 231.498875 yeah i think yeah that's probably true yeah we also saw Wild At Heart which is also a David Lynch movie that that that had been out now that was a weird movie
sw2198B-ms98-a-0047 231.498875 234.334250 that wa[s]- yeah that wa[s]-
sw2198B-ms98-a-0048 234.334250 245.469250 it was it was about uh a guy uh Nicholas Cage does Elvis Presley like a like a pseudo Elvis Presley impersonation through the whole movie he's like a real violent uh
sw2198B-ms98-a-0049 245.469250 256.734625 twenty year old and he uh he's in love with this girl that's about sixteen or seventeen and they leave he's involved with like a murder and then um

sw2198B-ms98-a-0053 262.999750 269.199875 and uh he get they get more he gets more involved with this robbery and whatever but it's sort of
sw2198B-ms98-a-0054 269.199875 271.979000 yeah he gets in trouble everywhere he goes it's real violent
sw2198B-ms98-a-0055 271.979000 273.182750 and uh
sw2198B-ms98-a-0056 273.182750 287.247500 you know which is like what David Lynch's other movies were about you know the so i don't know i just i didn't think it was that good my wife liked it a little bit more than i did she looks she looks at more some of the uh more creativeness behind it you know she likes the different type of movies
sw2198B-ms98-a-0057 287.247500 289.491625 yeah but i didn't think it was that good
sw2198B-ms98-a-0058 289.491625 292.487875 [silence]
sw2198B-ms98-a-0059 292.487875 298.480875 yeah that that's sort of the way i feel too i don't know what else we just saw something recently
sw2198B-ms98-a-0060 298.480875 300.988250 [silence]
sw2198B-ms98-a-0061 300.988250 303.739250 yeah they say that's pretty good well how old are you
sw2198B-ms98-a-0062 303.739250 311.482250 twenty one oh see you're young so you you see i'm thirty one so you see this as like a mythical thing you know so you're like
sw2198B-ms98-a-0063 311.482250 313.244125 [silence]
sw2198B-ms98-a-0064 313.244125 315.987875 yeah uh-huh
sw2198B-ms98-a-0065 315.987875 321.987000 yeah it's one of the things uh if you read in the newspapers and stuff he's the critics really like it or they really don't
sw2198B-ms98-a-0066 321.987000 325.963750 yeah so i think uh but i think it's supposed to be well done
sw2198B-ms98-a-0067 325.963750 336.029000 [silence]
sw2198B-ms98-a-0068 336.029000 337.477500 uh-huh
sw2198B-ms98-a-0069 337.477500 344.490000 [silence]
sw2198B-ms98-a-0070 344.490000 348.246125 right yeah [laughter] yeah
sw2198B-ms98-a-0071 348.246125 349.741750 [silence]
sw2198B-ms98-a-0072 349.741750 357.983375 uh-huh that's true yeah i guess i guess uh i well i was watching uh Arsenio Hall the other night and uh
sw2198B-ms98-a-0073 357.983375 362.678875 the actor that plays Jim Morrison's one of the other uh
sw2198B-ms98-a-0074 362.678875 364.713250 uh not Val Kilmer the um
sw2198B-ms98-a-0075 364.713250 378.473125 Tom McLaughlin who plays one of the other characters in the band one of the other men in the band uh was on was on uh Arsenio and he was talking about it you know and uh he said that uh they tried to stick pretty much to you know
sw2198B-ms98-a-0076 378.473125 391.469000 the real story and and and for to for all of them to get an understanding of how their characters were they c[ould]- they watched older videotapes you know of their them in interviews and things like that so they tried to make it pretty you know close to the line
sw2198B-ms98-a-0077 391.469000 395.688250 but uh they also said that whatever the guy that directed it
sw2198B-ms98-a-0078 395.688250 405.251375 i don't [vocalized-noise] he uh he's very he really liked The Doors so it was very much his impression too you know so so if you have
sw2198B-ms98-a-0079 405.251375 414.464250 yeah yeah and he's a very strong willed person and his his ideas whatever came through you know with however so they said if if you um
sw2198B-ms98-a-0080 414.464250 427.360375 yeah so so if you like his view and his direction in other words then you'll really like the movie you know so probably if you liked his other two movies uh those are like Wall Street and Platoon then
sw2198B-ms98-a-0081 427.360375 437.983875 yeah yeah if you like Plat[oon]- yeah if you liked Platoon you'll probably really like this because it takes pretty much the same direction for the time you know uh i think
sw2198B-ms98-a-0082 437.983875 443.472625 so that's uh because he has a pretty strong will and he directs his own way so it should be you know pretty good
sw2198B-ms98-a-0083 443.472625 445.759375 [silence]
sw2198B-ms98-a-0084 445.759375 447.278000 yeah

sw2198B-ms98-a-0100 484.217125 485.997375 [silence]
sw2198B-ms98-a-0101 485.997375 488.499625 yeah that's what they're yeah that's what they're really looking for
sw2198B-ms98-a-0102 488.499625 498.184375 i think just how we speak also looking where we pause and where we don't things like that yeah but that's pretty that's good um what do you get many movies on campus
sw2198B-ms98-a-0103 498.184375 510.970750 [silence]

sw2198B-ms98-a-0110 526.997625 532.235750 yeah yeah because my wife and i saw it in the theatre we really liked it
sw2198B-ms98-a-0111 532.235750 539.682000 [silence]
sw2198B-ms98-a-0112 539.682000 546.242750 yeah it was a great that's a i think that's that's one thing too um you know you can't get [vocalized-noise] so much caught up in the expense 
sw2198B-ms98-a-0113 546.242750 552.488625 as as you do a good telling a good story and i thought that was that movie really told a good story
sw2198B-ms98-a-0114 552.488625 562.018750 and and i think if you really like the story going along with it you don't notice that it's a little bit you know it might not have as many camera angles or it may not have
sw2198B-ms98-a-0115 562.018750 571.268375 you know uh because the you know the character actors the town the community people were just great they just seem so real you know they came right off the screen
sw2198B-ms98-a-0116 571.268375 572.749875 [silence]
sw2198B-ms98-a-0117 572.749875 573.998250 uh-huh

sw2198B-ms98-a-0123 590.220000 600.686000 but see i really think yeah i- i think those characters came right off the screen in that story you know it was really enjoyable and and my wife we thought the same thing we were so pleasantly surprised
