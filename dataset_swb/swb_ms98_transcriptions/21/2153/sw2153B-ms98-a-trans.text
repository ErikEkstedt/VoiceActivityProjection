sw2153B-ms98-a-0002 3.981375 8.266000 well i can relate to uh when i decided to choose a college
sw2153B-ms98-a-0003 8.266000 12.010000 uh it really had very little to do with academics [laughter]
sw2153B-ms98-a-0004 12.010000 21.308875 uh i i stayed at a i went to a local uh university that was close to home it's about sixty miles away went to the University of Wisconsin
sw2153B-ms98-a-0005 21.308875 30.752750 and uh besides it being uh close and being a uh major university in the big ten a prestigious conference i joined the marching band
sw2153B-ms98-a-0006 30.752750 35.981625 and uh that really was uh a good deal of the motivation for going to that uh college
sw2153B-ms98-a-0007 35.981625 37.736250 [silence]
sw2153B-ms98-a-0008 37.736250 41.495125 yeah something to do extracurricular activity
sw2153B-ms98-a-0009 41.495125 43.262125 i play the trumpet
sw2153B-ms98-a-0010 43.262125 52.979375 [silence]
sw2153B-ms98-a-0011 52.979375 54.344375 [laughter]
sw2153B-ms98-a-0012 54.344375 55.709500 okay
sw2153B-ms98-a-0013 55.709500 69.242750 [silence]
sw2153B-ms98-a-0014 69.242750 70.720000 uh-huh
sw2153B-ms98-a-0015 70.720000 79.988625 [silence]
sw2153B-ms98-a-0016 79.988625 82.193125 at least start saving
sw2153B-ms98-a-0017 82.193125 88.471625 [silence]
sw2153B-ms98-a-0018 88.471625 94.303375 well i think most people when they are in high school are very undecided about what course of study they want to take
sw2153B-ms98-a-0019 94.303375 101.983375 and they really don't have the foggiest idea of what kind of career they want to get into at least until at least until they've been in college for a couple of years
sw2153B-ms98-a-0020 101.983375 126.752500 [silence]
sw2153B-ms98-a-0021 126.752500 128.271375 uh-huh
sw2153B-ms98-a-0022 128.271375 132.473500 [silence]
sw2153B-ms98-a-0023 132.473500 139.299750 yeah well i i started uh studying mathematics basically because i was really good at that in high school
sw2153B-ms98-a-0024 139.299750 149.469250 and uh by the time i was a sophomore i decided that mathematics was really not the thing to be into to find a good job they weren't hiring mathematicians at the time
sw2153B-ms98-a-0025 149.469250 161.471500 so i started taking computer science courses and uh that become my major course of study uh i finished a major in mathematics also i had a double major but uh computer science is what got me a job
sw2153B-ms98-a-0026 161.471500 165.755750 and it was very uh very much in demand for a career
sw2153B-ms98-a-0027 165.755750 169.998875 uh still is that's true it's uh very good choice
sw2153B-ms98-a-0028 169.998875 171.224375 [silence]
sw2153B-ms98-a-0029 171.224375 172.729750 um-hum
sw2153B-ms98-a-0030 172.729750 181.205375 so but i know many people who have changed majors several times in uh college uh in fact very few people finish in four years now
sw2153B-ms98-a-0031 181.205375 187.743000 [silence]
sw2153B-ms98-a-0032 187.743000 197.497750 uh i really don't think it makes that much difference what size of the school college or university one chooses as long as they have a decent program and they're uh
sw2153B-ms98-a-0033 197.497750 198.576875 uh
sw2153B-ms98-a-0034 198.576875 199.732875 [silence]
sw2153B-ms98-a-0035 199.732875 203.272125 well known throughout the country
sw2153B-ms98-a-0036 203.272125 204.775000 [silence]
sw2153B-ms98-a-0037 204.775000 205.983250 uh-huh
sw2153B-ms98-a-0038 205.983250 222.288875 [silence]
sw2153B-ms98-a-0039 222.288875 223.714875 yeah
sw2153B-ms98-a-0040 223.714875 225.490000 [silence]
sw2153B-ms98-a-0041 225.490000 227.977250 well that does make a difference uh
sw2153B-ms98-a-0042 227.977250 237.235875 Wisconsin had a very good reputation in uh computer science and engineering departments and i'm sure that helped uh helped me get job offers
sw2153B-ms98-a-0043 237.235875 247.726125 uh if you choose a school that's not well known or it does not have a very good curriculum in uh in the in those areas uh it could be difficult to uh make a career out of it 
sw2153B-ms98-a-0044 247.726125 251.388875 [silence]
sw2153B-ms98-a-0045 251.388875 256.293000 kind of like uh going to SMU they have a reputation as being a party school
sw2153B-ms98-a-0046 256.293000 258.065875 and uh
sw2153B-ms98-a-0047 258.065875 258.870375 i just
sw2153B-ms98-a-0048 258.870375 259.462750 [laughter]
sw2153B-ms98-a-0049 259.462750 266.797750 i have to question how worthwhile it is to go to a school that uh really isn't uh that well known for their academics
sw2153B-ms98-a-0050 266.797750 268.204750 [silence]
sw2153B-ms98-a-0051 268.204750 273.247625 [laughter] i took a couple of semesters of graduate school there myself
sw2153B-ms98-a-0052 273.247625 275.486375 [silence]
sw2153B-ms98-a-0053 275.486375 276.793000 right
sw2153B-ms98-a-0054 276.793000 278.743125 [silence]
sw2153B-ms98-a-0055 278.743125 280.190500 okay
sw2153B-ms98-a-0056 280.190500 282.995625 [silence]
sw2153B-ms98-a-0057 282.995625 284.486500 uh-huh
sw2153B-ms98-a-0058 284.486500 290.744375 [silence]
sw2153B-ms98-a-0059 290.744375 296.491375 yeah [laughter] i was just mak[ing]- making a point that some schools develop certain reputations and
sw2153B-ms98-a-0060 296.491375 301.286875 [silence]
sw2153B-ms98-a-0061 301.286875 302.700000 uh-huh
sw2153B-ms98-a-0062 302.700000 310.647875 [silence]
sw2153B-ms98-a-0063 310.647875 313.253250 yeah that that's true uh
sw2153B-ms98-a-0064 313.253250 319.698250 i i took uh like i said i took uh couple of semesters at SMU and it at SMU in uh engineering courses
sw2153B-ms98-a-0065 319.698250 329.465250 but uh it really did conflict too much with uh with my work it's very difficult uh to maintain a full-time job and try to take uh courses uh in off hours
sw2153B-ms98-a-0066 329.465250 331.491125 [silence]
sw2153B-ms98-a-0067 331.491125 334.250500 so i quit doing that several years ago
sw2153B-ms98-a-0068 334.250500 336.988625 [silence]
sw2153B-ms98-a-0069 336.988625 347.771625 well yeah somewhat [laughter] i wouldn't mind going back to school again if i thought it i wasn't going to get in trouble again with the with the work it just takes too much time
sw2153B-ms98-a-0070 347.771625 351.498250 going back full-time i think is is the way to go
sw2153B-ms98-a-0071 351.498250 352.728625 [silence]
sw2153B-ms98-a-0072 352.728625 361.283000 yeah if one can afford to do that that's back to the reason why why i joined the band that was my entertainment while i was in school
sw2153B-ms98-a-0073 361.283000 364.713375 going to all the football games and hockey and basketball games
sw2153B-ms98-a-0074 364.713375 373.493000 uh because when you're a poor starving student you don't have the uh cash flow to uh entertain yourself [laughter] you have to find whatever means you can
sw2153B-ms98-a-0075 373.493000 375.722000 those events were always free
sw2153B-ms98-a-0076 375.722000 383.482000 [silence]
sw2153B-ms98-a-0077 383.482000 385.330750 [laughter]
sw2153B-ms98-a-0078 385.330750 386.491000 [silence]
sw2153B-ms98-a-0079 386.491000 388.302125 that sounds exciting
sw2153B-ms98-a-0080 388.302125 390.284625 [silence]
sw2153B-ms98-a-0081 390.284625 391.325375 uh-huh
sw2153B-ms98-a-0082 391.325375 392.692250 [silence]
sw2153B-ms98-a-0083 392.692250 406.476250 i'd recommend that if if someone was trying to choose a college that they they get uh as much information on the schools as they can as far as what curriculums they offer and uh how reputable they are and what kind of reputation they have in the country
sw2153B-ms98-a-0084 406.476250 407.711750 [silence]
sw2153B-ms98-a-0085 407.711750 410.495125 and uh go from there
sw2153B-ms98-a-0086 410.495125 416.234375 the rest of it's just personal preference whether you like the mascot or not or whether it's close by
sw2153B-ms98-a-0087 416.234375 417.630000 [silence]
sw2153B-ms98-a-0088 417.630000 427.992625 i mean uh Wisconsin was only up uh sixty mile bus ride away from my parents house so it only took an hour to get back on uh oh a couple weekends a semester
sw2153B-ms98-a-0089 427.992625 429.999000 it was very convenient
sw2153B-ms98-a-0090 429.999000 435.995125 not to mention being a public university it was the tuition was uh much less expensive
sw2153B-ms98-a-0091 435.995125 437.500375 [silence]
sw2153B-ms98-a-0092 437.500375 451.975500 i looked into going to Marquette also and had a chance to get a scholarship there but it would have only covered uh about a quarter of the cost of the first uh year which uh wasn't enough of a motivation to uh to go there to commit to to four years
sw2153B-ms98-a-0093 451.975500 453.230625 [silence]
sw2153B-ms98-a-0094 453.230625 458.497375 um-hum yeah i'm sure that that's uh it's not uh cheap either
sw2153B-ms98-a-0095 458.497375 460.744250 [silence]
sw2153B-ms98-a-0096 460.744250 462.493375 well that's good
sw2153B-ms98-a-0097 462.493375 470.998250 i i got uh by with the minimal amount of financial aid and was able to pay it all off within two years of graduation
sw2153B-ms98-a-0098 470.998250 476.760000 so i was very pleased with that of course i lived like a pauper too during that time
sw2153B-ms98-a-0099 476.760000 481.494875 i know a lot of people that did most couldn't afford to to go to a movie
sw2153B-ms98-a-0100 481.494875 484.716375 it was uh really living on a budget
sw2153B-ms98-a-0101 484.716375 487.501125 forced you to learn a few things that's true
sw2153B-ms98-a-0102 487.501125 489.277875 [silence]
sw2153B-ms98-a-0103 489.277875 493.980500 tried to have fun being in the band was about the only entertainment i had
sw2153B-ms98-a-0104 493.980500 498.479000 [silence]
sw2153B-ms98-a-0105 498.479000 503.328875 that was fun uh lived on Tombstone pizzas and Coca-Cola [laughter]
sw2153B-ms98-a-0106 503.328875 508.259250 [silence]
sw2153B-ms98-a-0107 508.259250 509.995750 okay
sw2153B-ms98-a-0108 509.995750 511.339625 [silence]
sw2153B-ms98-a-0109 511.339625 516.672125 well wonder if if this advice was uh worth following for uh choosing a school [laughter]
sw2153B-ms98-a-0110 516.672125 521.940375 [silence]
sw2153B-ms98-a-0111 521.940375 529.775625 they're being recorded and uh oh put in uh i guess in Washington DC somewhere for reference for speech projects
sw2153B-ms98-a-0112 529.775625 534.497500 [silence]
sw2153B-ms98-a-0113 534.497500 538.984750 yeah that is true based on where where you come from and all
sw2153B-ms98-a-0114 538.984750 539.991375 [silence]
sw2153B-ms98-a-0115 539.991375 543.316625 where you're educated in the first uh ten years i guess
sw2153B-ms98-a-0116 543.316625 546.771625 [silence]
sw2153B-ms98-a-0117 546.771625 550.699250 okay i appreciate it enjoyed it all right bye
