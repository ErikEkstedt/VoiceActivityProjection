sw2151A-ms98-a-0005 9.100125 18.119500 well i i think it's a pretty good deal i think they should either do that o[r]- or or afford some time to the military or or helping elderly people i
sw2151A-ms98-a-0006 18.119500 27.358875 i i'd you know i think that we have a bunch of elderly folks in the country that could use some help and i think that before we expend all our young talent overseas and
sw2151A-ms98-a-0007 27.358875 33.311125 and helping other countries we ought to perhaps give a little bit of our help to our own folks at home and
sw2151A-ms98-a-0008 33.311125 41.688125 i'm not sure that that's not a bad {idear} and or the military for a year or two wouldn't be bad for i think it teaches kids how to grow how about_1 yourself

sw2151A-ms98-a-0011 81.409375 93.996500 but you know they kids seem like when they get ten or twelve years old they fall out of that an[d]- and they don't follow it at all you know there're very few scouts go on and become Eagle Scouts and and i don't know what the high rank is for the gals but
sw2151A-ms98-a-0012 93.996500 98.150625 ah senior okay so there's not uh

sw2151A-ms98-a-0022 138.984000 147.598875 i think that yeah i think that we need to really address what we've done here and and then perhaps even a six month tour overseas that gives a much broader outlook
sw2151A-ms98-a-0023 147.598875 158.251500 well it's been really good we talked about this for a few minutes and uh hopefully we'll have another good topic maybe another call someday but i i don't really have too much more to say on this topic i gue[ss]-
