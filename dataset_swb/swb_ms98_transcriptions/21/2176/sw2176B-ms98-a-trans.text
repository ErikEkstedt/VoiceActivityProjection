sw2176B-ms98-a-0034 122.251875 128.757000 that one is electric so he's got to plug that in and drag the cord around
sw2176B-ms98-a-0035 128.757000 134.824875 and let's see um hedge clippers you know electric of course he[dge]- hedge clippers
sw2176B-ms98-a-0036 134.824875 138.945750 um i think that's all of the power tools we have
sw2176B-ms98-a-0037 138.945750 143.301500 we um but that's that's i think that's about all they make [laughter]

sw2176B-ms98-a-0040 146.144000 150.727125 oh once a week um actually though um we just moved
sw2176B-ms98-a-0041 150.727125 153.357875 to uh Texas a year and a half ago
sw2176B-ms98-a-0042 153.357875 156.482250 and they have a new uh
sw2176B-ms98-a-0043 156.482250 162.665000 system that they're trying to promote here which is uh they don't bag it as they call it um
sw2176B-ms98-a-0044 162.665000 168.880000 [noise] essentially you know cutting it um probably more like every four or five days and
sw2176B-ms98-a-0045 168.880000 173.579750 so it's still short enough so that you can mulch it back into the grass
sw2176B-ms98-a-0046 173.579750 179.465625 and never bag it for one thing um cuts down on waste for landfills and all of that
sw2176B-ms98-a-0047 179.465625 180.738625 [silence]
sw2176B-ms98-a-0048 180.738625 183.807250 um it's actually through the County Extension Service
sw2176B-ms98-a-0049 183.807250 186.930625 and they put out all kinds of information on it
sw2176B-ms98-a-0050 186.930625 195.660500 and then they put up uh they had a few lawns in the area that were like uh samples and they put a big sign in their yard that said you know this is a don't bag it lawn
sw2176B-ms98-a-0051 195.660500 204.815250 and let you watch and see how they did it so their grass clippings were never bagged they just mulch back into the grass itself and acted as a fertilizer
sw2176B-ms98-a-0052 204.815250 208.927000 [silence]
sw2176B-ms98-a-0053 208.927000 218.053750 yeah as a matter of fact and our lawn mower does that too it's you you shut off the where the bag would go or where it would you know spray out the side
sw2176B-ms98-a-0054 218.053750 224.543625 so that it just mulches underneath it just goes back down um right underneath the blade
sw2176B-ms98-a-0055 224.543625 227.438250 [silence]
sw2176B-ms98-a-0056 227.438250 228.462875 right
sw2176B-ms98-a-0057 228.462875 233.077875 no that's no that's not it's not necessary to have that nope
sw2176B-ms98-a-0058 233.077875 234.738250 but y[ou]-
sw2176B-ms98-a-0059 234.738250 239.111375 y[ou]- you have to but you're you're right though in that you do have to cut it though when it's
sw2176B-ms98-a-0060 239.111375 246.602250 um relatively short you can't let it go a week or two because if the clippings are that long then they'll just lay on top
sw2176B-ms98-a-0061 246.602250 251.158000 they have to be short enough that they'll still fall back down um into the grass
sw2176B-ms98-a-0062 251.158000 253.045000 [silence]
sw2176B-ms98-a-0063 253.045000 259.613000 it ta[kes]- takes him a lot less time because even though he does have to do it every four or five days
sw2176B-ms98-a-0064 259.613000 269.688500 um since he doesn't have to bag all of those clippings you know i[t]- rather than taking i don't know as an example an hour and a half to do the whole lawn it only takes an hour
sw2176B-ms98-a-0065 269.688500 272.809000 so you know plus less bags less waste
sw2176B-ms98-a-0066 272.809000 275.054375 [silence]
sw2176B-ms98-a-0067 275.054375 280.659375 um we tried that but we really weren't happy with it so he does that all himself now

sw2176B-ms98-a-0073 300.022125 309.771125 oh gee i['d]- i'd say our grass is getting green right now so i'm sure he'll in fact he may have already cut it once i can't remember
sw2176B-ms98-a-0074 309.771125 313.280125 um but it'll be yeah we'll have to start cutting real soon

sw2176B-ms98-a-0129 492.651250 496.153250 i think you're supposed to turn it every once in a while
sw2176B-ms98-a-0130 496.153250 502.382750 well i think it it on the inside is where it the chemicals you know it starts to break down
sw2176B-ms98-a-0131 502.382750 504.868000 and i think if you're supposed to turn it
sw2176B-ms98-a-0132 504.868000 511.373625 i mean not not very often but you know go in and and stir it up so to speak to get the
sw2176B-ms98-a-0133 511.373625 513.985875 stuff on the outside in to the inside
