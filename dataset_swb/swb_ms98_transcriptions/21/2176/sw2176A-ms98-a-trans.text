sw2176A-ms98-a-0022 85.884125 88.245875 i i feel a lot better doing it with a
sw2176A-ms98-a-0023 88.245875 93.367375 power mower with that with a [laughter] with a pull tractor on it so i don't have to push so hard
sw2176A-ms98-a-0024 93.367375 96.725000 but uh i enjoy going and cutting the grass i like the way it looks

sw2176A-ms98-a-0064 249.162250 250.900500 oh that's interesting
sw2176A-ms98-a-0065 250.900500 252.921125 maybe there's something i can try this time around
sw2176A-ms98-a-0066 252.921125 254.330375 [noise]

sw2176A-ms98-a-0071 274.475625 280.260875 [silence]
sw2176A-ms98-a-0072 280.260875 285.828625 oh well i um i tried it about ten years ago and i've been doing it ever since i've been having it treated
sw2176A-ms98-a-0073 285.828625 288.448875 and it makes it grow much faster uh [laughter]
sw2176A-ms98-a-0074 288.448875 294.938125 our season though in New England uh is is only three months or so and then it starts getting cold again in Septem[ber]-
sw2176A-ms98-a-0075 294.938125 299.840375 [laughter] [laughter-so] we don't have um i guess out in Dallas you must have a a longer season
sw2176A-ms98-a-0076 299.840375 304.339875 [silence]
sw2176A-ms98-a-0077 304.339875 305.925375 no kidding [laughter]

sw2176A-ms98-a-0079 307.855375 309.849625 [laughter] no kidding
sw2176A-ms98-a-0080 309.849625 312.810375 [silence]
sw2176A-ms98-a-0081 312.810375 314.226625 wow
sw2176A-ms98-a-0082 314.226625 319.461250 [silence]
sw2176A-ms98-a-0083 319.461250 326.562750 oh we i- i don't go that uh that deep it starts getting cold wh[en]- as soon as the cold weather comes it stunts the growth of the uh the grass
sw2176A-ms98-a-0084 326.562750 334.881625 i know in the summer time i've got to uh i've got to h[old]- actually hold it as long as i can uh as long as i can make the grass
sw2176A-ms98-a-0085 334.881625 340.097750 i can't cut it i think it's the recommended three three and a half inches they want me to leave it
sw2176A-ms98-a-0086 340.097750 341.544000 so i can cut it
sw2176A-ms98-a-0087 341.544000 342.311375 [laughter]
sw2176A-ms98-a-0088 342.311375 346.033125 well in the summer time so that the heat doesn't uh burn the grass
sw2176A-ms98-a-0089 346.033125 349.208125 and they recommend that i keep the blade very high
sw2176A-ms98-a-0090 349.208125 356.338250 so because it's that high i have to do it frequently as well i try to do it every uh uh six or seven days
sw2176A-ms98-a-0091 356.338250 358.001625 if
sw2176A-ms98-a-0092 358.001625 361.843250 um i rea[lly]- i've got a mixture i guess [laughter]
sw2176A-ms98-a-0093 361.843250 368.431125 [laughter] it's all different kind[s]- but if i let it grow too long if i let it go like a week and a half two weeks then it starts seeding on me
sw2176A-ms98-a-0094 368.431125 377.972250 and that's it gets too long and then it uh starts bunching up underneath the lawn mower and i can't get it out and and it's uh it it turns out to be a real mess so i've got to do it uh
sw2176A-ms98-a-0095 377.972250 380.371000 uh no later than once a week
sw2176A-ms98-a-0096 380.371000 386.885000 and i uh i don't block off my my uh chute but i don't pick up my grass either
sw2176A-ms98-a-0097 386.885000 393.484125 i leave it on the lawn and uh i try to go over it again i do pick up or i rake up uh
sw2176A-ms98-a-0098 393.484125 397.473750 you know the clumps that uh that occur but i try to leave it down there
sw2176A-ms98-a-0099 397.473750 400.544000 i did pick up uh a lawn sweeper
sw2176A-ms98-a-0100 400.544000 401.589250 [silence]
sw2176A-ms98-a-0101 401.589250 410.283000 yeah that's kind of that's kind of like uh the old-fashioned carpet sweeper only it's it's wide [laughter-and] [laughter-you] [laughter-put] [laughter-it] [laughter-on] [laughter-your] [laughter-grass] and what it does is it sweeps the lawn and it only picks up
sw2176A-ms98-a-0102 410.283000 411.361625 [silence]
sw2176A-ms98-a-0103 411.361625 421.390875 you know the height that you you set it at so i set it very high and it just picks or it skims the grass it doesn't dig way down deep so i don't have a lot of grass that i uh that i collect
sw2176A-ms98-a-0104 421.390875 422.656500 [silence]
sw2176A-ms98-a-0105 422.656500 428.733375 oh yeah works very good with leaves because leaves typ[ically]- if you pick them_1 up right away uh they'll sit on top of the grass
sw2176A-ms98-a-0106 428.733375 435.419000 and uh i'm trying to find a way how to uh electrify it or motorize [laughter-it] because of this i have to push
sw2176A-ms98-a-0107 435.419000 441.984625 but it uh it's it's wide enough to pick up uh like the width two widths of a lawn mower
sw2176A-ms98-a-0108 441.984625 444.407500 so you can do it relatively quickly
sw2176A-ms98-a-0109 444.407500 454.084250 [silence]
sw2176A-ms98-a-0110 454.084250 458.299375 i [noise] i try to take the the clippings and uh
sw2176A-ms98-a-0111 458.299375 461.600750 put them_1 in a mulching not a mulching but uh
sw2176A-ms98-a-0112 461.600750 463.239250 to let them_1 decompose
sw2176A-ms98-a-0113 463.239250 465.189750 i think that is mul[ching]- uh what do they call that
sw2176A-ms98-a-0114 465.189750 466.610625 compost pile [laughter]
sw2176A-ms98-a-0115 466.610625 474.582250 i haven't been very successful i'm on my third year now and i still have a a pile in the back yard [laughter-and] [laughter-it] it doesn't decompose i guess i got
sw2176A-ms98-a-0116 474.582250 478.145875 [laughter] you supposed to put chemicals on it
sw2176A-ms98-a-0117 478.145875 479.619625 no [laughter]

sw2176A-ms98-a-0122 483.581500 486.538750 it's getting it's shrinking down it's getting small
sw2176A-ms98-a-0123 486.538750 492.804750 but it uh it's still grass it's it's dried up grass and [laughter-it] it just stays there it doesn't turn into dirt

sw2176A-ms98-a-0135 517.289375 519.214000 [laughter] maybe it'll work
sw2176A-ms98-a-0136 519.214000 525.958375 uh the other thing i was thinking of doing is getting some chemicals to try and help the process up uh a little more a little faster
sw2176A-ms98-a-0137 525.958375 532.565875 [silence]

sw2176A-ms98-a-0142 542.601625 548.615875 i um i'm seriously thinking of discontinuing the chemical service because of the uh
sw2176A-ms98-a-0143 548.615875 554.317125 um i guess what i didn't realize was that that they're actually putting poisons on my grass
sw2176A-ms98-a-0144 554.317125 567.764375 and it wasn't until uh a year or two ago where the state required anyone putting chemicals on lawns that they tell the the customers what they're actually putting on the lawn and what the uh the hazards are
sw2176A-ms98-a-0145 567.764375 571.344500 and uh my children are all grown up now but
sw2176A-ms98-a-0146 571.344500 581.481875 when they were younger i was fertilizing my grass and didn't realize that some of the the chemicals that are on the grass that are being put on by the chemical companies um stay there longer than
sw2176A-ms98-a-0147 581.481875 583.235125 than than a few hours

sw2176A-ms98-a-0149 584.427375 592.656625 and yeah and my uh dog was out there playing in the grass and they were playing in the grass so i don't what long term effects that they uh the chemicals
sw2176A-ms98-a-0150 592.656625 597.590000 had on the grass but that's bothered me to the point where i'm th[inking]- thinking about discontinuing it this year
sw2176A-ms98-a-0151 597.590000 599.942000 and try to get more uh [vocalized-noise]
