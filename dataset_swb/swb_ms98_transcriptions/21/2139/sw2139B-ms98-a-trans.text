sw2139B-ms98-a-0005 11.824500 13.528875 i guess the
sw2139B-ms98-a-0006 13.528875 15.149625 um
sw2139B-ms98-a-0007 15.149625 17.527125 biggest thing i f[ind]-

sw2139B-ms98-a-0011 22.632250 26.278625 aspects uh particularly
sw2139B-ms98-a-0012 26.278625 30.028000 the ability of people to access
sw2139B-ms98-a-0013 30.028000 35.719875 you know your financial records or for example your credit r[ating]- uh rating
sw2139B-ms98-a-0014 35.719875 36.758750 [silence]

sw2139B-ms98-a-0018 43.117875 44.945000 of course
sw2139B-ms98-a-0019 44.945000 51.119500 flying uh using your Social Security number of course permits people to do that
sw2139B-ms98-a-0020 51.119500 53.779875 and almost anything you do now
sw2139B-ms98-a-0021 53.779875 54.874500 [silence]
sw2139B-ms98-a-0022 54.874500 57.757250 uh a Social Security number is required
sw2139B-ms98-a-0023 57.757250 59.277750 and uh
sw2139B-ms98-a-0024 59.277750 68.964500 of course there's another aspect of this too uh in terms of invasion of privacy i just thought about it being a professional and of course you probably belong to
sw2139B-ms98-a-0025 68.964500 74.358000 one or more professional organizations and that is that
sw2139B-ms98-a-0026 74.358000 79.896750 some of the organizations sell their mailing lists
sw2139B-ms98-a-0027 79.896750 84.697500 which i think is a is an invasion of privacy
sw2139B-ms98-a-0028 84.697500 87.545125 [laughter]

sw2139B-ms98-a-0050 184.662000 186.885375 getting called by strangers
sw2139B-ms98-a-0051 186.885375 190.651250 uh particularly solicit you know soliciting
sw2139B-ms98-a-0052 190.651250 192.090750 so
sw2139B-ms98-a-0053 192.090750 200.411500 having your and i know that a lot of these of course are random phone calls they just you know start going through the phone book or going through a series of numbers
sw2139B-ms98-a-0054 200.411500 204.425250 but some of them are sold and i know you talking about mailing lists

sw2139B-ms98-a-0057 208.729500 213.456250 group to which i belong and for some the reason they have three
sw2139B-ms98-a-0058 213.456250 215.054000 different
sw2139B-ms98-a-0059 215.054000 216.148000 [silence]
sw2139B-ms98-a-0060 216.148000 217.497750 names

sw2139B-ms98-a-0070 247.904125 249.760250 and uh
sw2139B-ms98-a-0071 249.760250 256.108000 i think those two things bother me more than anything else as far as an invasion of privacy
sw2139B-ms98-a-0072 256.108000 257.589750 and uh
sw2139B-ms98-a-0073 257.589750 258.590125 [silence]

sw2139B-ms98-a-0079 318.066125 320.962375 i know when i sit down with the family
sw2139B-ms98-a-0080 320.962375 324.545625 and want to have the opportunity you know to talk
sw2139B-ms98-a-0081 324.545625 327.709500 and see what's going on and all those things 
sw2139B-ms98-a-0082 327.709500 330.055750 even if [laughter-friends] [laughter-call]
sw2139B-ms98-a-0083 330.055750 336.140750 it irritates me so i try to i actually during that period of time
sw2139B-ms98-a-0084 336.140750 343.487750 from you know usually from six o'clock or six thirty whenever i get home until eight or so i will
sw2139B-ms98-a-0085 343.487750 345.210250 shut off the phone

sw2139B-ms98-a-0087 346.311000 352.164500 and uh my daughter gets [laughter-irate] when i when i do that because_1 you know she's a teenager
sw2139B-ms98-a-0088 352.164500 356.392250 so she'll you know why are you cutting off the phone i might get an important phone call so
sw2139B-ms98-a-0089 356.392250 357.457750 [silence]
sw2139B-ms98-a-0090 357.457750 360.205125 so tho[se]- i guess those three things are the uh
sw2139B-ms98-a-0091 360.205125 361.454000 um
sw2139B-ms98-a-0092 361.454000 362.493250 [silence]

sw2139B-ms98-a-0100 444.843125 448.256750 to the answering service at the office
sw2139B-ms98-a-0101 448.256750 453.417625 so that i do not have to have a um a ring at all
sw2139B-ms98-a-0102 453.417625 454.464250 [silence]
sw2139B-ms98-a-0103 454.464250 456.464625 if i if i want to do that

sw2139B-ms98-a-0129 535.573625 538.903125 uh shifting over to that service
sw2139B-ms98-a-0130 538.903125 542.063875 uh for a while or if in a while
sw2139B-ms98-a-0131 542.063875 546.846000 as soon as we determine what we're going to do with Contel after we [laughter-bought] [laughter-Contel] [laughter]
