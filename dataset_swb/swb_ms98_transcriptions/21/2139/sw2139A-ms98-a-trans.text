sw2139A-ms98-a-0022 114.373375 120.459625 um and they ask you what type of household items do you own like stereos and TV's and VCR's and

sw2139A-ms98-a-0060 261.091125 270.670125 i think i dislike the phone number part the worst i mean it's it's one thing to get junk mail because_1 you can you can just put it right in the trash but it's the phone calls and
sw2139A-ms98-a-0061 270.670125 276.031250 you know usually when they call you it's going to be when you s[it]- right when you sit down to dinner because_1 they know
sw2139A-ms98-a-0062 276.031250 289.498000 they pretty much know that you're at work all day and they call you right when when you've just gotten home from work the last thing you want is a phone [laughter-call] unless it's you know something halfway enjoyable but if it's a salesperson it's just something you don't want to have to mess with and
sw2139A-ms98-a-0063 289.498000 298.922875 and i've gotten a lot of them lately or i'll sometimes i come home from work and there's a lot of hang ups on my answering machine and i'm just assuming it's probably a salesman that called during the day and
sw2139A-ms98-a-0064 298.922875 305.286500 i wasn't home and they'll probably call me up and you know call me back and bother me when i sit down to dinner later on but
sw2139A-ms98-a-0065 305.286500 314.189500 i find that very annoying the uh mail stuff yeah you know it's kind of irritating but it's not nearly as obnoxious as the phone calls

sw2139A-ms98-a-0084 369.485125 376.314625 when i come home from work there's times i need to pay bills i need to balance my checking account i need to do all kinds of different things like that and
sw2139A-ms98-a-0085 376.314625 383.703250 even though it's friends calling sometimes you just feel like this is my quiet time i need to get things done and the phone ringing bothers me but that's
sw2139A-ms98-a-0086 383.703250 394.786000 that's where answering machines are nice because if it's really important they'll leave a message and i can call them_1 [laughter-back] but uh at work i have so many phone calls from customers calling in sometimes it is just
sw2139A-ms98-a-0087 394.786000 408.336125 i just want to get away from the phone ringing because it it really does annoy me and uh if i've had a lot of phone calls during the day when occasionally we have uh like this past week we have to do a lot of troubleshooting when the programmers have installed a new system 
sw2139A-ms98-a-0088 408.336125 416.649250 and uh phone rings like crazy and you come home and the last thing you want to do is have to answer the phone and if it's some salesman that just makes it even that much worse
sw2139A-ms98-a-0089 416.649250 421.889000 and uh it just i get to where i- i turn the answering machine on
sw2139A-ms98-a-0090 421.889000 434.978750 and just let it pick up the phone but now with this thing i'm participating in i kind of have to answer it [laughter-because] [laughter-you] [laughter-never] [laughter-know] if it's the switchboard or if it's uh you know somebody calling that you really don't want to talk on the phone
