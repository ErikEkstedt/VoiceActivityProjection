sw2111B-ms98-a-0005 9.600750 15.485250 well um i live in Garland and we're just beginning to
sw2111B-ms98-a-0006 15.485250 20.521375 [noise] we we just built a real big recycling center [noise]
sw2111B-ms98-a-0007 20.521375 24.920250 that recycles everything imaginable but
sw2111B-ms98-a-0008 24.920250 27.000750 as far as that um
sw2111B-ms98-a-0009 27.000750 30.648125 trash pick up and stuff that a lot of the communities are doing
sw2111B-ms98-a-0010 30.648125 34.339375 they're testing that so they're really not full
sw2111B-ms98-a-0011 34.339375 38.676750 full force into it but they're trying so we're attempting it
sw2111B-ms98-a-0012 38.676750 40.676000 but i wish we could do more

sw2111B-ms98-a-0020 73.226375 75.158625 right that's what i do
sw2111B-ms98-a-0021 75.158625 77.584375 [silence]
sw2111B-ms98-a-0022 77.584375 79.264250 [laughter]
sw2111B-ms98-a-0023 79.264250 83.491625 right where they put the centers and stuff like that
sw2111B-ms98-a-0024 83.491625 91.306125 yeah uh well we have those um which i think is one of the best things is those cash for cans i don't know if you all have those around
sw2111B-ms98-a-0025 91.306125 96.055625 and i really like that because that makes it real convenient because_1 they're in almost every shopping center
sw2111B-ms98-a-0026 96.055625 100.293125 and you can just stop by now [noise] everything else like the tra[sh]- um
sw2111B-ms98-a-0027 100.293125 102.323750 [noise] paper and
sw2111B-ms98-a-0028 102.323750 106.136000 plastic and stuff you still have to go to the centers but
sw2111B-ms98-a-0029 106.136000 111.119000 but for aluminum that's real nice and i started doing that at work [noise] um i put out a
sw2111B-ms98-a-0030 111.119000 114.840000 a trash can and you know for people to put their aluminum cans in
sw2111B-ms98-a-0031 114.840000 118.964750 and that's really helped a lot i mean everybody's pitched in and
sw2111B-ms98-a-0032 118.964750 125.516125 you know it doesn't bother them_1 to walk little bit farther put their aluminum in a can rather than just throwing it in their trash can
sw2111B-ms98-a-0033 125.516125 133.762750 so i really really like that but people are really concerned it's just that sometimes it's not the right people
sw2111B-ms98-a-0034 133.762750 136.554125 which is really really sad
sw2111B-ms98-a-0035 136.554125 140.536125 because_1 i wish we would do more [noise] at work we started
sw2111B-ms98-a-0036 140.536125 142.009875 um
sw2111B-ms98-a-0037 142.009875 149.396250 all the recycling stuff they're really trying i think what started it at work was that planet earth thing that we had last year
sw2111B-ms98-a-0038 149.396250 154.945750 and um that really started a lot of stuff off but
sw2111B-ms98-a-0039 154.945750 157.388750 you know sometimes it dwindles down

sw2111B-ms98-a-0058 205.666625 209.928875 i'm even trying you know that was one thing we noticed [laughter-last] week that 
sw2111B-ms98-a-0059 209.928875 212.373625 we had some new people move into our building
sw2111B-ms98-a-0060 212.373625 217.049625 and [vocalized-noise] you know the nice cardboard boxes that you m[ove]- packing boxes
sw2111B-ms98-a-0061 217.049625 221.922375 and they were just used one time and thrown in the dumpster and i thought
sw2111B-ms98-a-0062 221.922375 229.898750 i don't [laughter-understand] [laughter-this] you know we're trying to cut cost and everything like that and and recycle and all that stuff and
sw2111B-ms98-a-0063 229.898750 236.505750 and here we are wasting and i don't understand sometimes the way the thinking the logic behind it

sw2111B-ms98-a-0108 368.864375 370.123375 we have
sw2111B-ms98-a-0109 370.123375 373.100750 places that um
sw2111B-ms98-a-0110 373.100750 376.175750 [noise] pay for paper
sw2111B-ms98-a-0111 376.175750 380.674500 to recycle i know you do yours at work but for newspaper
sw2111B-ms98-a-0112 380.674500 387.857250 but ours are real hard to find that's the one thing that really discourages me i saved pa[per]- you know i recycle paper
sw2111B-ms98-a-0113 387.857250 389.460875 but they
sw2111B-ms98-a-0114 389.460875 393.885750 it's almost like they don't want the paper because they don't pay
sw2111B-ms98-a-0115 393.885750 402.567625 at all i mean they're real hard to find the places that pay and that's really discouraging i mean i just go ahead and take it to the the regular place where it's
sw2111B-ms98-a-0116 402.567625 405.080625 you know they just accept it
sw2111B-ms98-a-0117 405.080625 410.280375 but they um i think they should you know they want people to recycle i think it's a
sw2111B-ms98-a-0118 410.280375 416.008625 you know like the aluminum you know it gets people to uh doing it you know you might you don't have to pay them_1 a lot

sw2111B-ms98-a-0127 441.158125 444.830500 that's good i the one thing i don't like about the newspaper also is um
sw2111B-ms98-a-0128 444.830500 450.399250 like at work we have two different trash cans at your desk you have one for paper
sw2111B-ms98-a-0129 450.399250 454.505875 and one for just your normal trash [noise] but in uh
sw2111B-ms98-a-0130 454.505875 461.477250 in the paper one you have to separate you have to make sure you don't throw away any of the slick paper like magazines
sw2111B-ms98-a-0131 461.477250 465.050750 you can't throw any of that away and you can't throw
sw2111B-ms98-a-0132 465.050750 470.482625 certain file type things away and i just think it's such a hassle it seems like it would be
sw2111B-ms98-a-0133 470.482625 471.562375 [silence]
sw2111B-ms98-a-0134 471.562375 475.091000 it'd be easy to take it all i don't know of course i don't know all that about
sw2111B-ms98-a-0135 475.091000 477.013125 recycling so
sw2111B-ms98-a-0136 477.013125 482.840125 probably it's a hassle but i do get tired of having to separate paper you know we're
sw2111B-ms98-a-0137 482.840125 486.625625 [silence]
sw2111B-ms98-a-0138 486.625625 487.803875 right
sw2111B-ms98-a-0139 487.803875 491.581125 right we had uh a write up in our paper [noise]
sw2111B-ms98-a-0140 491.581125 494.897125 uh this last time at work about um
sw2111B-ms98-a-0141 494.897125 495.967375 [silence]
sw2111B-ms98-a-0142 495.967375 503.297625 they come and you empty your trash every other day they do your normal trash and every other day they do your recycling trash
sw2111B-ms98-a-0143 503.297625 509.613000 and somebody was writing in complaining that the people had um dumped all the trash in the same bin
sw2111B-ms98-a-0144 509.613000 514.757750 and when they were questioned about it they said well we're running late or we didn't have time to do those bins or something
sw2111B-ms98-a-0145 514.757750 521.026625 and that's real discouraging thinking you're sitting [laughter-there] working to separate it and then they
sw2111B-ms98-a-0146 521.026625 522.272125 [silence]
sw2111B-ms98-a-0147 522.272125 529.782250 right right so they're they're really trying to start keeping an eye out for those you know talking to the people again about
sw2111B-ms98-a-0148 529.782250 533.179625 you know separate them_1 because_1 that is discouraging when you
sw2111B-ms98-a-0149 533.179625 536.893375 when you do that it was hard to get used to those two different trash cans
sw2111B-ms98-a-0150 536.893375 540.065875 but luckily that'll all get straightened out and

sw2111B-ms98-a-0152 541.072375 545.311750 and they'll they'll start separating them because_1 i don't mind doing that i feel like i'm doing uh
sw2111B-ms98-a-0153 545.311750 548.471625 doing something for the community when i'm doing that
