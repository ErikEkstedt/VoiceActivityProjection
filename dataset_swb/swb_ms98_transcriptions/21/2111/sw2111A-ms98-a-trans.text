sw2111A-ms98-a-0011 41.352625 49.057250 yeah there's there's been no emphasis on recycling at all in San Antonio i used to work for the power company here and there was discussion
sw2111A-ms98-a-0012 49.057250 53.541125 for a while about uh building a garbage burning
sw2111A-ms98-a-0013 53.541125 59.470125 uh electric generation plant but it just wasn't cost effective at the time
sw2111A-ms98-a-0014 59.470125 66.116875 and there's there's a little recycling trucks and things throughout the city but there isn't any um [noise]
sw2111A-ms98-a-0015 66.116875 74.826000 advertising campaign there's just not any push to recycle i recycle my newspapers and uh alumi[num]- my aluminum stuff
sw2111A-ms98-a-0016 74.826000 76.157625 but uh
sw2111A-ms98-a-0017 76.157625 80.671625 they make it as hard as possible it's just not very convenient to do

sw2111A-ms98-a-0035 156.991750 161.160750 yeah where i work now we recycle all the computer paper
sw2111A-ms98-a-0036 161.160750 163.704750 but that's about the extent of it
sw2111A-ms98-a-0037 163.704750 165.305625 [silence]
sw2111A-ms98-a-0038 165.305625 167.064625 yeah yeah

sw2111A-ms98-a-0040 169.465000 179.545750 and i'm sure that the uh driving factor for recycling the computer paper is that we get paid to do so [vocalized-noise] we sell the paper back to
sw2111A-ms98-a-0041 179.545750 183.778375 the uh to a paper manufacturing company
sw2111A-ms98-a-0042 183.778375 185.210500 [silence]
sw2111A-ms98-a-0043 185.210500 192.906500 well it it defrays the cost of buying the paper i think i not by much but it does defray it some
sw2111A-ms98-a-0044 192.906500 198.718500 enough to make it worth our while to have several bins through out the building

sw2111A-ms98-a-0053 238.732250 250.723000 someone moved offices in my building and uh the uh properties people came in with all with the good cardboard boxes not the cheap ones of course and packed everything up and moved them and left them lying around
sw2111A-ms98-a-0054 250.723000 257.454125 i- i took several home because i'm moving pretty soon and they're good boxes and they were just going to throw them away

sw2111A-ms98-a-0061 266.671750 270.140125 so you know there they don't take up much storage space
sw2111A-ms98-a-0062 270.140125 272.377500 [silence]
sw2111A-ms98-a-0063 272.377500 279.784000 yeah yeah i- i felt a little guilty about taking the boxes for about two seconds until i realized they would be thrown away so
sw2111A-ms98-a-0064 279.784000 282.959750 and i thought well i was doing them a favor by taking them_1
sw2111A-ms98-a-0065 282.959750 288.547250 [silence]

sw2111A-ms98-a-0069 296.887750 303.115875 yeah the ones at the grocery store half the time they've pulled the lid off so you can't use it anyway
sw2111A-ms98-a-0070 303.115875 311.132875 those uh and the uh real sturdy boxes that copy room paper comes in with the nice lids those get thrown away
sw2111A-ms98-a-0071 311.132875 315.004000 and i am constantly scouting out the copy room for those [laughter-boxes]
sw2111A-ms98-a-0072 315.004000 316.034500 those are
sw2111A-ms98-a-0073 316.034500 319.237375 those are perfect boxes to put files in [laughter]

sw2111A-ms98-a-0076 330.109500 338.606625 what i've done in the past i don't have any now but i would buy some cheap wallpaper from somewhere and cover those nice boxes with the lids
sw2111A-ms98-a-0077 338.606625 343.802500 and you can stack them_1 up and and leave them_1 out and put things in them_1 even
sw2111A-ms98-a-0078 343.802500 345.281500 um-hum
