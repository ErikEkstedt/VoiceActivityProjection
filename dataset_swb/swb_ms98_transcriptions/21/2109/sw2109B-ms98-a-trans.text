sw2109B-ms98-a-0044 203.086000 217.884000 that was hilarious the the i guess the the first the first uh scene in that movie that really got my attention uh concerning the the that disease and all that was when he uh dropped the the uh the toothpicks
sw2109B-ms98-a-0045 217.884000 224.365000 and he was able to count the number of toothpicks just by a mental image unbelievable

sw2109B-ms98-a-0050 241.610625 253.309250 yeah yeah and i the the i think the the best thing about Rain Man was the uh the way that they put together the the real awfulness of the of the of the disease
sw2109B-ms98-a-0051 253.309250 267.078750 a[nd]- only a[nd]- a[nd]- and then they balanced it with the wonderfulness of it you know and and and you need to to to work with it uh you know certainly on on a daily basis but then ag[ain]- then again work with it toward a good end
sw2109B-ms98-a-0052 267.078750 273.106500 not not toward you know winning in [laughter-Las] [laughter-Vegas] for example

sw2109B-ms98-a-0060 304.338875 316.730375 that's older and uh he's not you know nothing nothing of course serious is wrong with him but uh but we have gone through these these lapses of of a relationship somewhat sometimes
sw2109B-ms98-a-0061 316.730375 327.777875 and then you know uh for for for no real you know uh uh direct reason i guess uh we we get into uh uh a really good relationship for a while and then
