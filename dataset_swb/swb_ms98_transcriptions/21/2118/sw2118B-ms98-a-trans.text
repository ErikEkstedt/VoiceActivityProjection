sw2118B-ms98-a-0002 1.001000 2.628375 okay
sw2118B-ms98-a-0003 2.628375 5.010125 well let's see
sw2118B-ms98-a-0004 5.010125 16.938250 [silence]
sw2118B-ms98-a-0005 16.938250 28.607000 right uh we don't uh get that in uh straight fashion but you know the other major channels have been carrying a lot of it so i've seen a good bit of their coverage
sw2118B-ms98-a-0006 28.607000 34.962625 [silence]
sw2118B-ms98-a-0007 34.962625 36.558125 uh-huh
sw2118B-ms98-a-0008 36.558125 50.808500 [silence]
sw2118B-ms98-a-0009 50.808500 64.036125 right oh they've really done uh good job of keeping everybody informed of what's going on sometimes i've wondered if it wasn't almost more than we needed to [laughter-know] [laughter]
sw2118B-ms98-a-0010 64.036125 69.849875 [silence]
sw2118B-ms98-a-0011 69.849875 71.996500 uh-huh
sw2118B-ms98-a-0012 71.996500 85.382750 well our um newspaper does a pretty good job on most things but you know its uh not totally in depth and quite frankly i didn't read all of the war stuff
sw2118B-ms98-a-0013 85.382750 98.343375 you know it was just there were too many long article and i try to quickly read through the paper before work in the morning so i don't don't get to spend a lot of time on everything
sw2118B-ms98-a-0014 98.343375 101.408625 [silence]
sw2118B-ms98-a-0015 101.408625 103.376125 [vocalized-noise] i'm at work yes
sw2118B-ms98-a-0016 103.376125 104.603250 uh-huh
sw2118B-ms98-a-0017 104.603250 117.135250 [silence]
sw2118B-ms98-a-0018 117.135250 124.530125 what about your uh radio stations do they uh provide much in the way of current event stuff
sw2118B-ms98-a-0019 124.530125 126.009500 [noise]
sw2118B-ms98-a-0020 126.009500 148.493000 [silence]
sw2118B-ms98-a-0021 148.493000 157.618750 uh-huh well i've lived in a small town before and was quite aware of the local radio station at that time and i know how they are
sw2118B-ms98-a-0022 157.618750 160.155250 well ours uh that we
sw2118B-ms98-a-0023 160.155250 174.167625 tend to listen to most um i like the way they handle news type things because in the morning and in the evening they'll have you know five minutes worth of news every half hour 
sw2118B-ms98-a-0024 174.167625 183.696250 but in the middle of the day they don't just drown you with the same old stuff and they won't interrupt unless it's you know really important
sw2118B-ms98-a-0025 183.696250 189.446625 and and of course they did a good bit for some of the war stuff but they didn't just over do it
sw2118B-ms98-a-0026 189.446625 206.134375 [silence]
sw2118B-ms98-a-0027 206.134375 207.797375 yeah
sw2118B-ms98-a-0028 207.797375 212.042875 [silence]
sw2118B-ms98-a-0029 212.042875 215.563250 i think so i- i don't really think we
sw2118B-ms98-a-0030 215.563250 227.116375 need to know or even sometimes care so much about all the little nitty-gritty things they keep asking over and over i think think the reporters sometimes ask the silliest questions
sw2118B-ms98-a-0031 227.116375 232.431125 [silence]
sw2118B-ms98-a-0032 232.431125 245.409500 [laughter] yeah [laughter] things like that are just kind of absurd or once in a while they'll they'll keep uh just hounding someone that they're interviewing
sw2118B-ms98-a-0033 245.409500 258.674875 and there seems to be no purpose um you know the person has stated you know some opinion or fact or whatever and that should be the end of it and they just keep on and on and on
sw2118B-ms98-a-0034 258.674875 276.889375 [silence]
sw2118B-ms98-a-0035 276.889375 278.311875 uh-huh
