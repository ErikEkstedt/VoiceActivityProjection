sw2130A-ms98-a-0002 20.559875 25.744500 yeah it we i i read an interesting article in the paper that discussed uh
sw2130A-ms98-a-0003 25.744500 27.490125 that uh
sw2130A-ms98-a-0004 27.490125 33.566375 seemed that every other time a President tried to get support for an action like uh
sw2130A-ms98-a-0005 33.566375 39.238750 uh President Carter and his thing with the the hostage crisis [vocalized-noise] he always did it through rhetoric 
sw2130A-ms98-a-0006 39.238750 46.868250 and this time President Bush did it through action and he he drove policy
sw2130A-ms98-a-0007 46.868250 48.302625 by
sw2130A-ms98-a-0008 48.302625 57.179625 the course he took and almost forced public support or uh i mean he left almost no alternative
sw2130A-ms98-a-0009 57.179625 68.662875 and and it was very interesting how he did it and uh i mean i'm i'm an Air Force officer so it uh it was interesting for me uh you know i'd certainly
sw2130A-ms98-a-0010 68.662875 82.639500 uh i i mean i think it's great that all the support i have uh friends of mine from the Air F[orce]- i'm i'm an engineer and work in the Rolm Laboratory but other engi[neers]- guys here on base this is a B fifty two base where i work so
sw2130A-ms98-a-0011 82.639500 90.829625 we had about a thousand people gone from the base that went over there and they're getting a tremendous amount of support out of it
sw2130A-ms98-a-0012 90.829625 100.208375 [silence]
sw2130A-ms98-a-0013 100.208375 101.938375 yes it was
sw2130A-ms98-a-0014 101.938375 108.693750 [silence]
sw2130A-ms98-a-0015 108.693750 114.937875 yeah i'm i don't know the exact figure but i i would imagine that because of the
sw2130A-ms98-a-0016 114.937875 123.625625 how close the the the vote was i'm uh i mean almost certainly would have to be Just based on the sheer numbers of uh 
sw2130A-ms98-a-0017 123.625625 129.823375 the disparity of [noise] excuse me Democrats and Republicans in Congress he'd think that it would have to have been
sw2130A-ms98-a-0018 129.823375 135.605625 um and uh i i gosh this uh this whole thing now with all the uh
sw2130A-ms98-a-0019 135.605625 139.486625 all the political cartoons on the Democrats and how they're
sw2130A-ms98-a-0020 139.486625 140.971000 uh uh
sw2130A-ms98-a-0021 140.971000 146.270625 they're in in a sad way for ninety two now in terms of the presidential election anyway
sw2130A-ms98-a-0022 146.270625 147.421375 but
sw2130A-ms98-a-0023 147.421375 150.535250 [silence]

sw2130A-ms98-a-0026 155.717500 159.726000 right right i think that was all those
sw2130A-ms98-a-0027 159.726000 164.332125 factors played a part in you know uh the everyone was
sw2130A-ms98-a-0028 164.332125 169.110125 discussing whether we should uh wait longer but i i i know that
sw2130A-ms98-a-0029 169.110125 170.309000 there's a
sw2130A-ms98-a-0030 170.309000 180.623500 lot of reasons to wait longer but i think we were genuinely concerned about how their military capability and we uh i think we over estimated it but still we were really
sw2130A-ms98-a-0031 180.623500 186.200625 highly concerned about it and that we were worried that they were getting dug in and uh
sw2130A-ms98-a-0032 186.200625 187.296250 [silence]
sw2130A-ms98-a-0033 187.296250 188.511250 yeah

sw2130A-ms98-a-0036 196.580250 205.156500 Saddam thought he had the whole thing uh figured out to to which way we were coming and which what what our doctrine was that uh
sw2130A-ms98-a-0037 205.156500 207.364625 [silence]
sw2130A-ms98-a-0038 207.364625 209.846750 that's right that's true
sw2130A-ms98-a-0039 209.846750 212.948750 that's interesting i think uh

sw2130A-ms98-a-0041 213.951000 217.615375 this political situation over there now is uh
sw2130A-ms98-a-0042 217.615375 223.616875 uh it'll be interesting to see what comes out of it whether the this opposition will
sw2130A-ms98-a-0043 223.616875 233.801125 uh uh today the Turks uh agreed to support the Kurds which is something they've never done before and uh
sw2130A-ms98-a-0044 233.801125 240.501750 and uh this and the Israelis uh and not the Israelis but the Arabs all of a sudden are uh
sw2130A-ms98-a-0045 240.501750 244.222875 are cheering for Baker on his drive for
sw2130A-ms98-a-0046 244.222875 250.402250 to reconcile relations with the Israelis so it's like [laughter]

sw2130A-ms98-a-0059 295.443375 296.836125 i don't
sw2130A-ms98-a-0060 296.836125 307.591250 yeah i'd certainly uh support Israel in in their their policy that in defending themselves and in uh in their handling of their foreign policy i think
sw2130A-ms98-a-0061 307.591250 319.517000 i think the stand they have or or the way the command respect i i support that i think that is a a positive thing for them after um
sw2130A-ms98-a-0062 319.517000 323.788500 uh thousands of years they have to uh
sw2130A-ms98-a-0063 323.788500 333.079875 they had i think they in when they be[came]- became a country they more than or more or less decided they weren't going to take it anymore and uh
sw2130A-ms98-a-0064 333.079875 334.561750 yeah
sw2130A-ms98-a-0065 334.561750 337.845500 exactly exactly and uh
sw2130A-ms98-a-0066 337.845500 343.831750 um so gee i lost my train of thought here but uh
sw2130A-ms98-a-0067 343.831750 345.613000 um
sw2130A-ms98-a-0068 345.613000 355.323625 so okay so i can't say whether that that i'm pro Israel or anti Israel i mean i'd like to see them resolve something in that situation and get some stability
sw2130A-ms98-a-0069 355.323625 361.214500 in the region and looks uh that the joining of forces for this uh
sw2130A-ms98-a-0070 361.214500 365.652750 uh Desert Shield and Desert Storm thing ended up being a positive thing
sw2130A-ms98-a-0071 365.652750 384.098375 [silence]
sw2130A-ms98-a-0072 384.098375 385.382625 right

sw2130A-ms98-a-0076 396.697375 403.436500 yeah somebody's going to and i think that's the problem the P L O has is that when they
sw2130A-ms98-a-0077 403.436500 404.918500 whenever
sw2130A-ms98-a-0078 404.918500 406.001125 [silence]
sw2130A-ms98-a-0079 406.001125 412.302625 one group of them decides that they're going to negotiate or they're going to do something
sw2130A-ms98-a-0080 412.302625 416.979000 they're going to try to make some peace but uh
sw2130A-ms98-a-0081 416.979000 425.984375 the end result is that they there so many factions of them and uh some more violent than others some with a certain agenda different than the others or
sw2130A-ms98-a-0082 425.984375 430.138875 they split they end up being becoming divisive themselves
sw2130A-ms98-a-0083 430.138875 431.993875 uh i
sw2130A-ms98-a-0084 431.993875 440.304875 it's interesting i i'm i'm looking forward to seeing what happens over there in the next couple of months but uh that's

sw2130A-ms98-a-0086 443.530875 452.078500 yeah i know that that is almost i mean that's absolutely unprecedented that was an an incredible foreign policy
sw2130A-ms98-a-0087 452.078500 458.254750 coup on the part of the President and the State Department and that i mean that's never happened before and 
sw2130A-ms98-a-0088 458.254750 461.859500 i don't know if it will ever happen again but 
sw2130A-ms98-a-0089 461.859500 463.373000 yeah
sw2130A-ms98-a-0090 463.373000 464.852875 okay
sw2130A-ms98-a-0091 464.852875 470.054750 uh i guess uh well maybe the computer will pair us up together another time
