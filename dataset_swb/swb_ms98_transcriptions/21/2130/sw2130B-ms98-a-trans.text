sw2130B-ms98-a-0028 90.476250 101.135375 that's great um i[f]- if you remember the vote in the Congress to authorize war if necessary was actually pretty close
sw2130B-ms98-a-0029 101.135375 108.389625 and if if my memory serves me right i believe a majority of Democrats may even have opposed it
sw2130B-ms98-a-0030 108.389625 109.598000 [silence]
sw2130B-ms98-a-0031 109.598000 111.205125 it it was

sw2130B-ms98-a-0037 146.085375 151.411000 especially the ones that came out and said oh come on guys let's talk about this little while longer
sw2130B-ms98-a-0038 151.411000 156.556750 i mean how many years are we going to wait and what what do you do with the people that are over there in the mean time
sw2130B-ms98-a-0039 156.556750 161.996500 [silence]
sw2130B-ms98-a-0040 161.996500 163.442375 no doubt

sw2130B-ms98-a-0042 178.720375 180.445625 i think so too
sw2130B-ms98-a-0043 180.445625 186.141875 [silence]
sw2130B-ms98-a-0044 186.141875 193.182750 well they were and in fact they were so well dug in that uh when we sent our tanks around behind them they couldn't get turned around in time
sw2130B-ms98-a-0045 193.182750 203.654500 [silence]
sw2130B-ms98-a-0046 203.654500 208.887250 well had had we done a frontal assault it probably would have worked more to his favor
sw2130B-ms98-a-0047 208.887250 230.272625 [silence]
sw2130B-ms98-a-0048 230.272625 231.599875 hum

sw2130B-ms98-a-0051 234.053125 248.882250 [silence]
sw2130B-ms98-a-0052 248.882250 252.492625 well Baker is is really
sw2130B-ms98-a-0053 252.492625 255.925000 not very much pro Israel
sw2130B-ms98-a-0054 255.925000 260.567625 and did you know John Sununu is uh half Arab
sw2130B-ms98-a-0055 260.567625 263.550125 [silence]
sw2130B-ms98-a-0056 263.550125 264.859625 yeah
sw2130B-ms98-a-0057 264.859625 267.150375 [silence]
sw2130B-ms98-a-0058 267.150375 275.149875 right in fact when he was Governor of New Hampshire i believe okay
sw2130B-ms98-a-0059 275.149875 278.673125 i believe he was the only one of fifty governors
sw2130B-ms98-a-0060 278.673125 283.998625 that voted against some kind of resolution of support for Israel a few years back
sw2130B-ms98-a-0061 283.998625 293.364875 and uh now he is a conservative but he is not a conservative that favors Israel and that that concerns me greatly
sw2130B-ms98-a-0062 293.364875 331.822875 [silence]
sw2130B-ms98-a-0063 331.822875 335.567375 well they didn't have much choice they could either fight or die
sw2130B-ms98-a-0064 335.567375 337.681875 [silence]

sw2130B-ms98-a-0066 338.989375 365.331000 [silence]
sw2130B-ms98-a-0067 365.331000 368.409125 it is a positive thing um
sw2130B-ms98-a-0068 368.409125 375.200875 however uh every time an organization such as the PLO says well we'll see if we can work with Israel
sw2130B-ms98-a-0069 375.200875 384.688375 then uh they get embarrassed some every few months by documents that reveal that their ultimate purpose is to totally eliminate them
sw2130B-ms98-a-0070 384.688375 387.503625 and so you you basically have
sw2130B-ms98-a-0071 387.503625 398.288250 uh mutually exclusive interests either Israel is going to occupy the area or the Arabs are going to occupy the area and i'm just not sure that that there's going to be any easy permanent solution
sw2130B-ms98-a-0072 398.288250 429.254500 [silence]
