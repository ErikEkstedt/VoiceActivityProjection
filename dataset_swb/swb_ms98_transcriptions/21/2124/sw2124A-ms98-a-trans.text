sw2124A-ms98-a-0019 85.068000 92.999750 just brownies or French doughnuts would have been good but it's real hard to make them_1 they don't really come out like they do in New Orleans up here i don't know why
sw2124A-ms98-a-0020 92.999750 97.598500 i don't know if it's me or the water or the recipe i have but

sw2124A-ms98-a-0022 102.798750 109.969375 kind of like the Italians it's really good but instead i catered to their diet so i made baked chicken in the crock pot and
sw2124A-ms98-a-0023 109.969375 116.166375 um it was good and everything it had all the vegetables in it but it seemed kind of boring [laughter-compared]
sw2124A-ms98-a-0024 116.166375 117.953750 [silence]

sw2124A-ms98-a-0027 127.673000 132.710875 [noise] i find it changing the way that i eat but not the way i entertain
sw2124A-ms98-a-0028 132.710875 139.856875 because i guess i guess i feel like um if they're on a diet like that i'm gonna you know honor that
sw2124A-ms98-a-0029 139.856875 150.814500 but if it's just another couple came over um couple weeks later and i made what did i make that night i made a roast and i made um
sw2124A-ms98-a-0030 150.814500 155.378250 oh i can't believe this my husband broke the coffee pot i just bought yesterday
sw2124A-ms98-a-0031 155.378250 160.854625 i can't believe that anyway but um aft[er]- when Ricky and Carrie came over
sw2124A-ms98-a-0032 160.854625 173.535375 we made um a pot roast with rice and gravy and salad and the whole bit and normally i don't eat we don't eat like that during the week because of the you know the calories and the fat in it but
sw2124A-ms98-a-0033 173.535375 186.059875 you know when we're having guests we just kind of feel like just do it and i made blueberry cobbler [laughter] and we had extra crust with it i mean it was so fattening but i don't think we gained any weight from it so [laughter]
sw2124A-ms98-a-0034 186.059875 197.183125 [silence]

sw2124A-ms98-a-0038 206.418125 216.531750 but i did bake apples so that it would be not brownies you know i figured there was less calories in apple pan downy than in fudge brownies
sw2124A-ms98-a-0039 216.531750 220.810625 so um [noise] i got a good brownie recipe [laughter]
