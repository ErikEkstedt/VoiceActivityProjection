sw2180A-ms98-a-0002 1.335375 3.005250 here we go
sw2180A-ms98-a-0003 3.005250 5.165875 [silence]
sw2180A-ms98-a-0004 5.165875 11.509500 i sure was Two years ago i spent some Fourth of July to Labor Day
sw2180A-ms98-a-0005 11.509500 21.506375 on a jury that was uh a change of venue from Columbus Ohio for aggravated uh murder and kidnapping
sw2180A-ms98-a-0006 21.506375 27.485375 yeah it was quite a session that disrup[ted]- disrupted my whole summer of course
sw2180A-ms98-a-0007 27.485375 32.958625 five days a week but it was an absolutely fascinating experience
sw2180A-ms98-a-0008 32.958625 56.757625 [silence]
sw2180A-ms98-a-0009 56.757625 58.795250 uh-huh
sw2180A-ms98-a-0010 58.795250 75.522375 [silence]
sw2180A-ms98-a-0011 75.522375 77.827000 uh-huh
sw2180A-ms98-a-0012 77.827000 97.277000 [silence]
sw2180A-ms98-a-0013 97.277000 109.280750 uh-huh well i think that there are many cases where uh the judges probably do make the decision rather than the jury Our situation was somewhat different
sw2180A-ms98-a-0014 109.280750 121.318375 uh in view of the fact that uh we haven't we were a landmark case it was the first time in the state of Ohio that um D N A testing was entered as evidence
sw2180A-ms98-a-0015 121.318375 132.697375 and they were being the judge was being especially careful that everything was done correctly so there couldn't be a a mistrial of any kind uh the uh
sw2180A-ms98-a-0016 132.697375 147.590375 uh the interesting thing was the tremendous selection of jury process uh that we experienced That took one full week uh to get forty three people qualified to sit on the jury
sw2180A-ms98-a-0017 147.590375 157.759125 And then it was a matter of the selection of uh twelve people after that actually it was fourteen because we had two alternates
sw2180A-ms98-a-0018 157.759125 168.845375 and the judge was extremely concerned for our welfare if we were well if we were comfortable and uh things of that nature which made us feel good
sw2180A-ms98-a-0019 168.845375 180.262625 uh and we were sequestered but the makeup of the jury uh was truly a cross section of uh you might say a cross section of a country
sw2180A-ms98-a-0020 180.262625 192.721000 there was one other person besides myself we were the only ones that had ever been to college hm one was a former student of mine a few years before who was out of work
sw2180A-ms98-a-0021 192.721000 206.123750 uh two others were ones who had never finished high school and were out looking for jobs yet um a couple of them were housewives who had never worked and then some are people who did work
sw2180A-ms98-a-0022 206.123750 211.484375 so we had quite a cross section of black white and women and men
sw2180A-ms98-a-0023 211.484375 221.358375 and uh it uh it was interesting just to listen to the rationale uh being proposed and the logic of some of the people
sw2180A-ms98-a-0024 221.358375 230.079875 uh it was also extremely difficult to stay awake sometimes because there was so many witnesses and we were not allowed to take any notes of any kind
sw2180A-ms98-a-0025 230.079875 234.473875 uh and i thought that that was a failing because uh
sw2180A-ms98-a-0026 234.473875 245.715625 from the standpoint that it was difficult to try to remember everything and and yet the judge said well um if you're taking notes you're missing something
sw2180A-ms98-a-0027 245.715625 255.778625 and he was right there also but uh uh certainly um i think it depends upon how the judge handles the case
sw2180A-ms98-a-0028 255.778625 268.589125 and if the criminal chooses to have a uh three panel judge uh a three judge panel i should say i think he can have that rather than trial by jury 
sw2180A-ms98-a-0029 268.589125 274.829000 [silence]
sw2180A-ms98-a-0030 274.829000 276.667125 uh-huh
sw2180A-ms98-a-0031 276.667125 280.659250 [silence]
sw2180A-ms98-a-0032 280.659250 282.516500 you're kidding
sw2180A-ms98-a-0033 282.516500 286.513500 [silence]
sw2180A-ms98-a-0034 286.513500 289.062000 yes and money
sw2180A-ms98-a-0035 289.062000 295.569000 [silence]
sw2180A-ms98-a-0036 295.569000 297.590750 [laughter]
sw2180A-ms98-a-0037 297.590750 299.393375 yeah
sw2180A-ms98-a-0038 299.393375 312.402000 yeah i do think that that uh i do think the jury system works but i'd i also feel as you said that the original concept of the jury as it was originally setup
sw2180A-ms98-a-0039 312.402000 326.400500 uh back uh in a hundred years ago was fine but that it needs to be more refined for today's standard of living and the the uh level of education of them of so many people now
sw2180A-ms98-a-0040 326.400500 333.705125 uh by the same token we had um uh some people who wanted to had vacations planned
sw2180A-ms98-a-0041 333.705125 346.990375 and one man in particular had reservations made plane tickets made everything and the judge called and had it all canceled so he could get his money back and then he wasn't selected on the jury
sw2180A-ms98-a-0042 346.990375 361.065875 and then another young fellow had to meet with the judge and the prosecutor and the defense attorneys on three different occasions before he was finally excused from the jury because his wife was about to have twins
sw2180A-ms98-a-0043 361.065875 373.990500 and they had he had to go through all of that if in three days to get excused from that jury to be with his wife on the birth of the twins and uh you know some of it just seemed rather extreme
sw2180A-ms98-a-0044 373.990500 380.009750 [silence]
sw2180A-ms98-a-0045 380.009750 381.557125 yes
sw2180A-ms98-a-0046 381.557125 382.883375 [silence]
sw2180A-ms98-a-0047 382.883375 384.099500 right
sw2180A-ms98-a-0048 384.099500 395.963500 [silence]
sw2180A-ms98-a-0049 395.963500 397.694500 uh-huh
sw2180A-ms98-a-0050 397.694500 402.559125 [silence]
sw2180A-ms98-a-0051 402.559125 408.191000 right well i guess he'd have to be careful whether with entrapment or some of those things
sw2180A-ms98-a-0052 408.191000 418.112375 but uh i don't i assume you have seen on television recently as probably the whole country has the beating of the man in Los Angeles
sw2180A-ms98-a-0053 418.112375 427.091625 isn't that terrible And uh you know and that certainly uh cannot be said to be uh something that happens everywhere
sw2180A-ms98-a-0054 427.091625 434.424250 but the fact that it can happen that it probably does happen in many places it's it's horrendous and
sw2180A-ms98-a-0055 434.424250 447.118750 it's just a stroke of luck that someone was able to get it on tape and then uh to listen to the tape recording uh at the police station of the whole conversation afterwards
sw2180A-ms98-a-0056 447.118750 450.185000 [silence]
sw2180A-ms98-a-0057 450.185000 451.431750 yeah
sw2180A-ms98-a-0058 451.431750 453.397625 [silence]
sw2180A-ms98-a-0059 453.397625 454.781625 absolutely 
sw2180A-ms98-a-0060 454.781625 457.244875 well we just had a case uh 
sw2180A-ms98-a-0061 457.244875 466.056250 like up at the end of last year where one police officer it was on a drug raid uh was trying to extra extricate um
sw2180A-ms98-a-0062 466.056250 477.115875 a confession or information from a drug dealer and did so by placing a hot a hot iron on his chest his bare chest burned him
sw2180A-ms98-a-0063 477.115875 487.652125 they wound up paying him uh the officer of course was fired but they paid the defendant uh three hundred thousand dollars or something to drop the lawsuit
sw2180A-ms98-a-0064 487.652125 493.479375 and then last week someone shot and killed the former policeman
sw2180A-ms98-a-0065 493.479375 508.477250 so uh as some of those things uh are absolutely horrendous and we do need an all an overhaul and we just need more discipline country wide it would then we'd need it on that yeah
sw2180A-ms98-a-0066 508.477250 512.051750 well it's been very nice talking with you
sw2180A-ms98-a-0067 512.051750 516.985125 yes and uh good luck on on some other calls
sw2180A-ms98-a-0068 516.985125 519.091875 uh-huh bye-bye
sw2180A-ms98-a-0069 519.091875 520.678000 [silence]
