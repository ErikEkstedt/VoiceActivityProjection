sw2180B-ms98-a-0007 28.354250 32.566125 [silence]
sw2180B-ms98-a-0008 32.566125 44.134250 oh it sounds like it i haven't had any actual real life experience but uh my father-in-law's been involved in uh several trials including uh a couple of murders and uh
sw2180B-ms98-a-0009 44.134250 59.122625 you know talking to other people who have been there and so i don't have any real experience with trials but i do you know i i've i took a little business law in in college and and i've you know try to keep abreast of things but uh
sw2180B-ms98-a-0010 59.122625 67.297875 hm i think that the uh trial by jury is is a great idea at it's inception back two hundred years ago hm
sw2180B-ms98-a-0011 67.297875 76.948500 right now though it's it's so difficult because there's so few courts to to get anything really done as you know you spent you know a whole summer on one trial
sw2180B-ms98-a-0012 76.948500 86.238625 and it's just that i think they're just tying up the um whole judicial process um there's a lot of things they could do
sw2180B-ms98-a-0013 86.238625 98.831750 to uh make things easier and uh you know like uh the suggestion that uh maybe the uh a judge should be the one who decides on what the sentence should be rather than the jury

sw2180B-ms98-a-0035 267.539500 275.985875 yes yes i agree uh would surprise me that uh when i was in Texas i had the uh displeasure of getting a uh traffic ticket
sw2180B-ms98-a-0036 275.985875 282.269750 and um i went to court and you can even get a trial by jury for a traffic ticket
sw2180B-ms98-a-0037 282.269750 289.048375 no and i thought my God talk about tying up things for for
sw2180B-ms98-a-0038 289.048375 297.056625 yes i mean that's extremely expensive i mean the first thing you had to do when you came before the judge was waive your right to a jury trial
sw2180B-ms98-a-0039 297.056625 301.184875 i'm like God this is ridiculous [laughter]

sw2180B-ms98-a-0045 373.743000 384.129125 yes i- i think they can probably come up with some ways to insure that uh you know people would get a fair trial and not have to go through this process
sw2180B-ms98-a-0046 384.129125 395.971625 i mean some things are just so cut and dry um in the in you know the the level of evidence that they come up with now i mean you know when you start thinking about well they've got videotape and
sw2180B-ms98-a-0047 395.971625 404.288250 and audio tapes and they've they've got you know they've got ways to nail people [laughter] to the point where they they really shouldn't even be going to trial
