sw2161B-ms98-a-0013 85.640250 90.172750 uh just locally or or what i assume that's what they would do
sw2161B-ms98-a-0014 90.172750 92.876500 [silence]
sw2161B-ms98-a-0015 92.876500 94.271875 i would hope

sw2161B-ms98-a-0063 295.226250 299.215000 but that's that's hard if you don't have a big yard or if you live in an apartment [laughter]
