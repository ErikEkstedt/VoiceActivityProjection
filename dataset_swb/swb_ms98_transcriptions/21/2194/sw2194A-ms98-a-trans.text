sw2194A-ms98-a-0019 66.980500 79.236000 uh [noise] i do i do uh word processing on it primarily uh the main reason why i'm i'm hanging on to it is because of the business that i'm in the the home computer business i have a
sw2194A-ms98-a-0020 79.236000 86.511500 a store in my house where i've got the uh the hardware and the software and i also do repair work on the system
sw2194A-ms98-a-0021 86.511500 97.634375 if if i started using a different computer at home then i wouldn't be using the the software and the hardware and it would be that much more difficult for me to try and market it the the product
sw2194A-ms98-a-0022 97.634375 99.767000 [silence]
sw2194A-ms98-a-0023 99.767000 114.756375 uh oddly enough no uh because i do different things with it at home i i do mostly play and at work i do mostly work uh it's [laughter] you know you you you can put a game on an IBM compatible computer uh but uh
sw2194A-ms98-a-0024 114.756375 120.789000 you know i i don't normally do that at at work uh and i i typically deal with uh
sw2194A-ms98-a-0025 120.789000 125.652125 Lotus uh WordPerfect which is a spreadsheet
sw2194A-ms98-a-0026 125.652125 130.832750 and uh we also have a tie in to a mainframe out in in Dallas Texas
sw2194A-ms98-a-0027 130.832750 135.389500 and the mainframe has a lot of uh software out there where i use to
sw2194A-ms98-a-0028 135.389500 137.558125 interface my computer with
sw2194A-ms98-a-0029 137.558125 143.262250 [silence]
sw2194A-ms98-a-0030 143.262250 145.509000 no um
sw2194A-ms98-a-0031 145.509000 155.808750 there was at one point in time where where it was continually down it it appears at though whenever i wanted to use it it wasn't working and this was about
sw2194A-ms98-a-0032 155.808750 157.479375 seven ten years ago
sw2194A-ms98-a-0033 157.479375 170.842000 and they made a dramatic effort of trying to reduce down time down to nothing and today uh i can't say that i can remember the last time it went down uh several months it's it's just up all the time now
sw2194A-ms98-a-0034 170.842000 184.293375 they take it down like on Sunday nights like for a couple of hours to do maintenance or whatever but uh unless there's something dramatic that happens with the telephone system uh usually doesn't break down and i think what they're doing is they're using satellite somehow
sw2194A-ms98-a-0035 184.293375 191.513250 to uh to transmit the signals to have a backup some to back that that system up so that there is no no down time
sw2194A-ms98-a-0036 191.513250 197.318875 [silence]
sw2194A-ms98-a-0037 197.318875 211.321125 analysis [laughter] i don't i don't know how they fixed the problem but they're uh you know the whole theme of of what they were doing was was to measure and record and and uh reduce down time
sw2194A-ms98-a-0038 211.321125 213.683625 and the other big thing is uh
sw2194A-ms98-a-0039 213.683625 217.155125 quality satisfaction or customer satisfaction
sw2194A-ms98-a-0040 217.155125 225.406375 how do how do the users feel about the the system and what are their likes and dislikes and that's that's uh that's where they they were heading and
sw2194A-ms98-a-0041 225.406375 231.383625 uh the system is fantastic so it's it's not slow if anything the the PC is now slower than the mainframe
sw2194A-ms98-a-0042 231.383625 239.378000 [vocalized-noise] we're transmitting from from uh New England to Dallas Texas and i'm getting responses in in split seconds
sw2194A-ms98-a-0043 239.378000 240.750125 yeah
sw2194A-ms98-a-0044 240.750125 242.928000 [silence]
sw2194A-ms98-a-0045 242.928000 249.617000 oh well that that's another system that i link in to i i network internally to Texas Instruments in Attleboro
sw2194A-ms98-a-0046 249.617000 252.690625 and use the mainframe for
sw2194A-ms98-a-0047 252.690625 261.265375 corporation uh type programs like payroll and uh financial data bases and we also have uh
sw2194A-ms98-a-0048 261.265375 263.155625 uh a message system
sw2194A-ms98-a-0049 263.155625 266.531375 which is a worldwide network within within the corporation
sw2194A-ms98-a-0050 266.531375 269.949875 where i can send telegrams to any TI site
sw2194A-ms98-a-0051 269.949875 276.552875 and they've also hooked up to some company to allow us to do E-mail and allow it to convert it
sw2194A-ms98-a-0052 276.552875 282.773625 to other companies so that th[e]- other companies can recognize our E-mail and now we're getting into faxes as well
sw2194A-ms98-a-0053 282.773625 284.856750 right off the PC
sw2194A-ms98-a-0054 284.856750 291.206375 yeah that's uh the technology is really [laughter] really blow you know going going crazy with this
sw2194A-ms98-a-0055 291.206375 297.328250 [silence]
sw2194A-ms98-a-0056 297.328250 306.037000 uh originally i didn't think it was i thought that what ended you know we ended up doing was uh doing all of the secretarial work and the secretaries had nothing to do
sw2194A-ms98-a-0057 306.037000 318.403875 uh and and that i guess part of that is true [laughter] uh i do all my own typing i i i don't give anymore uh paper to the secretary to type up only because it takes me longer to write it
sw2194A-ms98-a-0058 318.403875 328.223000 and redo it and then give it back to her again than it does for me to sit down and and do it and correct it myself i i i am not a typist i type with two fingers but i do very well at it
sw2194A-ms98-a-0059 328.223000 335.809125 and uh i i do everything i do my only typing do my own foils uh it's just you know it's just so much easier for me to do that
sw2194A-ms98-a-0060 335.809125 342.510125 [silence]
sw2194A-ms98-a-0061 342.510125 343.647625 uh-huh
sw2194A-ms98-a-0062 343.647625 357.274500 [silence]
sw2194A-ms98-a-0063 357.274500 359.373625 yeah and
sw2194A-ms98-a-0064 359.373625 368.130875 the the files may be disappearing but the secretaries are not the the people people in power are are afraid to give up that status symbol
sw2194A-ms98-a-0065 368.130875 381.082250 and uh although what they're doing now is is they're maintaining secretaries but they're piling more and more people onto that one secretary rather than get rid of the secretary [laughter] they're they're just you know they're finding justification by adding more people to her
sw2194A-ms98-a-0066 381.082250 386.929625 [silence]
sw2194A-ms98-a-0067 386.929625 399.077750 well i don't know like back in in my particular office there must be at least uh twenty twenty five people one secretary no typewriter it's all computers everybody's got a a PC sitting in front of their desk 
sw2194A-ms98-a-0068 399.077750 404.595875 [silence]
sw2194A-ms98-a-0069 404.595875 416.671125 oh uh i i have a laser printer i have access to a laser printer in my office but i don't have one tied in to my system yet uh i'm i'm networked into it but it's so inconvenient for me to to
sw2194A-ms98-a-0070 416.671125 420.008500 to run all the way downstairs that [laughter] that i don't use it
sw2194A-ms98-a-0071 420.008500 424.467875 [silence]
sw2194A-ms98-a-0072 424.467875 425.704625 yeah
sw2194A-ms98-a-0073 425.704625 432.065875 [silence]
sw2194A-ms98-a-0074 432.065875 440.437750 well i think what i see is a different direction i don't know if you are you familiar with uh programs like Harvard Graphics where they have uh
sw2194A-ms98-a-0075 440.437750 452.982000 uh like a print shop or or a thing in the system well we have uh instead of using view view foil machines we have uh a transmitter that will pick up the signal from the the monitor
sw2194A-ms98-a-0076 452.982000 455.729875 and and transmit it just like a view foil
sw2194A-ms98-a-0077 455.729875 456.903750 [silence]
sw2194A-ms98-a-0078 456.903750 462.276875 so we we do that somewhat uh we also have uh teleconferencing where we have
sw2194A-ms98-a-0079 462.276875 463.296250 um
sw2194A-ms98-a-0080 463.296250 473.351625 the the mainframe as being the monitor in other words if you've got foils you pull it out of the mainframe and then use the telephone speaker system to communicate with
sw2194A-ms98-a-0081 473.351625 475.510375 and and we use uh
sw2194A-ms98-a-0082 475.510375 477.463750 we do teleconferencing that way
sw2194A-ms98-a-0083 477.463750 481.861250 so that that everybody's looking at the same foil because we're pulling it off the network
sw2194A-ms98-a-0084 481.861250 491.493375 [silence]
sw2194A-ms98-a-0085 491.493375 495.882500 oh yeah i can remember at one time the the uh
sw2194A-ms98-a-0086 495.882500 502.451625 secretaries actually had to be artists and [laughter] and technicians and today uh with the laser printer
sw2194A-ms98-a-0087 502.451625 514.440000 they're uh really not being utilized as much as they had been in the past i'm making some really pretty foils that uh four or five years ago i wouldn't have ever dreamed i could be doing them and it's it's so easy to do uh
sw2194A-ms98-a-0088 514.440000 516.862750 with the with the programs that are out there now
sw2194A-ms98-a-0089 516.862750 522.392125 [silence]
sw2194A-ms98-a-0090 522.392125 524.217750 all right okay
sw2194A-ms98-a-0091 524.217750 525.407375 [silence]
sw2194A-ms98-a-0092 525.407375 526.479500 i believe we have
sw2194A-ms98-a-0093 526.479500 529.128125 [silence]
sw2194A-ms98-a-0094 529.128125 531.385000 okay nice talking to you
sw2194A-ms98-a-0095 531.385000 532.638625 take it easy
