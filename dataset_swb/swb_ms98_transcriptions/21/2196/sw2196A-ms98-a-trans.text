sw2196A-ms98-a-0002 0.386500 4.572625 the home that uh we bought back in the early eighties
sw2196A-ms98-a-0003 4.572625 9.167125 was uh w[as]- w[as]- typical tract home and we were
sw2196A-ms98-a-0004 9.167125 23.768875 uh trying to find something that would would get us into the housing market as it were thinking that someday we'd move on uh the economy however changed that a little bit and looks like we're going to be in this home for a while but uh it's not too bad
sw2196A-ms98-a-0005 23.768875 27.771750 some of the things that we didn't uh think about
sw2196A-ms98-a-0006 27.771750 31.049750 when we bought it turned out uh
sw2196A-ms98-a-0007 31.049750 35.929750 worked out all right for us was we bought on a top of a hill
sw2196A-ms98-a-0008 35.929750 48.154250 and some of our neighbors down the the lower part uh get their yards flooded every once in a while doesn't get up into the house but it just makes a bit of a mess in the in the yard itself a little bit of debris and a little bit of runoff on the
sw2196A-ms98-a-0009 48.154250 58.199000 on the uh grass area it's kind of hard to keep grass in certain areas and i'd never really thought about that but but we're pretty much at the very top of this little hill and all the runoff from
sw2196A-ms98-a-0010 58.199000 69.760750 from the concrete uh the shopping center near us and the alleyway all that goes down to our neighbors so so that was a little thing that i'd never really considered and was fortunate that it worked out that way
sw2196A-ms98-a-0011 69.760750 78.458000 uh another uh calamity i guess that befalls some purchasers that i didn't uh think about when i first purchased this house was
sw2196A-ms98-a-0012 78.458000 89.829250 what can happen r[ight]- immediately behind you we are on the edge of a development that has a little retainer wall that separates us from the rest of the from a street and a little little uh business area
sw2196A-ms98-a-0013 89.829250 103.537125 and uh some friends of ours moved into a house and a couple of years later a a uh shopping center built up behind them and it was a grocery store that had that stocked at night at about three am every night
sw2196A-ms98-a-0014 103.537125 112.520000 they would run the trash compactor and it was so loud it would wake them up and they never got used to it and they finally had to move they just couldn't stand that noise
sw2196A-ms98-a-0015 112.520000 121.578750 then oddly enough after that they uh uh i[t]- it it closed down now that grocery store isn't there and hasn't been there for about six years now so
sw2196A-ms98-a-0016 121.578750 135.272750 uh it's kind of a a bad thing to happen but we happen to have landed again in a very lucky spot there is a little business development behind us that's a bit of a a a little bank and a couple of dry cleaning things and
sw2196A-ms98-a-0017 135.272750 143.516875 little strip shopping center but it's several houses down because the property that's the other side of our little wall is a triangle shape
sw2196A-ms98-a-0018 143.516875 157.204500 and the wedge part of the triangle got too skinny to do anything more than put some grass and trees there there's not even a parking lot so it it's a nice uh two or three houses on either side of us is nice grass and trees and
sw2196A-ms98-a-0019 157.204500 163.905250 and then across from that is a a major four lane street and then across from that is
sw2196A-ms98-a-0020 163.905250 178.319125 is uh the parks of the city that we live in has some soccer fields and some baseball fields and that completely goes on to the horizon so as far as we can look out over our little retaining wall is grass and trees and parks
sw2196A-ms98-a-0021 178.319125 181.256875 and we really didn't didn't uh
sw2196A-ms98-a-0022 181.256875 194.840125 i mean that wasn't our consideration wh[en]- when we bought it it was a complete blank lot they hadn't even built the house yet and we were new to the this whole process and all we knew is that it was a the cheapest house that this this tract development uh sold
sw2196A-ms98-a-0023 194.840125 199.273625 so it turned out to be pretty good and
sw2196A-ms98-a-0024 199.273625 200.694000 Dallas
sw2196A-ms98-a-0025 200.694000 202.189000 [silence]
sw2196A-ms98-a-0026 202.189000 216.751250 yeah it's uh it's a nice area as it were about the only two things that uh didn't work out too well for us well one of them's_1 nice in in a way we're on the beginning of a corner we live on a on a
sw2196A-ms98-a-0027 216.751250 222.723250 U shaped drive and we're the first house that they actually started turning
sw2196A-ms98-a-0028 222.723250 232.525250 to make for a turn on a on a cul-de-s[ac]- not a cul-de-sac but a turn on a ninety degree turn on the street which meant that we're not jammed right up against our neighbor's house
sw2196A-ms98-a-0029 232.525250 242.017625 there's there's like twelve or fifteen feet on one side but on the other side there's over sixty feet before the next house because_1 they they set us back a little ways and they turned it sideways
sw2196A-ms98-a-0030 242.017625 253.766125 so our houses begin to to turn to to make this turn as it were so we're real far away and we have a really large lot we have a bigger lot than all the rest of the the ones down the street
sw2196A-ms98-a-0031 253.766125 266.527000 but uh as it turned out we decided we learned that neither one of us really likes taking care of all that grass so i[t]- it was a bit of a drawback but uh it'll probably make for a good selling point if we ever give it to someone that does like all that grass
sw2196A-ms98-a-0032 266.527000 276.682375 and uh we did also end up in a in an area that we didn't we didn't realize when we bought it that uh the soil is that uh black clay and it
sw2196A-ms98-a-0033 276.682375 288.706375 it tends to uh go to the extremes of being dry or being moist and it it's done a little bit of a foundation damage that uh most of these houses get no matter how much watering we do
sw2196A-ms98-a-0034 288.706375 294.611000 so we have to contend with doors that sometimes sometimes the during the year don't uh
sw2196A-ms98-a-0035 294.611000 298.647250 j[ust]- close just right and uh things of that nature
sw2196A-ms98-a-0036 298.647250 300.470125 [silence]
sw2196A-ms98-a-0037 300.470125 306.342750 yeah that's true there are there is a little s[egment]- little segment up near McKinney and up near um
sw2196A-ms98-a-0038 306.342750 308.989750 uh they said out near Wylie there's some
sw2196A-ms98-a-0039 308.989750 316.221000 some little areas where the soil is completely sandy and then it it uh goes back into the black gumbo around it
sw2196A-ms98-a-0040 316.221000 328.457125 but there are some housing developments that uh the guy that came out and inspected our damage was saying that there are some little little pockets of neighborhoods that don't have these problems at all and had i only known [laughter-you] [laughter-know] maybe i'd have looked over there
sw2196A-ms98-a-0041 328.457125 330.550125 uh what about your house

sw2196A-ms98-a-0058 412.624875 414.711000 yeah we've got
sw2196A-ms98-a-0059 414.711000 420.927625 [noise] we've got one that's done that uh we've been pretty fortunate most of our neighbors have had many more um
sw2196A-ms98-a-0060 420.927625 430.004875 i don't know that we've done anything different to prevent ours from doing that but most of our neighbors have ended up replacing them_1 uh buying some nice Anderson windows or some
sw2196A-ms98-a-0061 430.004875 438.194000 some uh name brand windows uh one neighbor went with whatever Sears installs and they have the the
sw2196A-ms98-a-0062 438.194000 451.252125 different kind of window that the kind that you can tilt out either pane and and raise or lower you know lower the top down or the bottom up or tilt it in both of them_1 tilt in so you can clean them_1 or and it's a real strange
sw2196A-ms98-a-0063 451.252125 457.820375 mechanical beast but uh they haven't lost their seal yet so it's i guess there's a qua[lity]- some quality in it

sw2196A-ms98-a-0089 526.817375 531.077500 yeah that could be but once you get that moisture in there it
sw2196A-ms98-a-0090 531.077500 534.780250 it can fog up and not go away quickly enough
sw2196A-ms98-a-0091 534.780250 542.343625 well i hear my kid calling me i better go see what he wants [noise] okay bye
