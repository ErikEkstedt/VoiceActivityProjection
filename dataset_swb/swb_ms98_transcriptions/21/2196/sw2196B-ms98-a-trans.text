sw2196B-ms98-a-0044 329.591750 341.592875 well we bought uh our first house at the end of eighty six and like i said it's out in Rowlett and it's it's real nice it's four bedroom and it's kind of a tract area too we've got people behind us and on both sides of us
sw2196B-ms98-a-0045 341.592875 348.318500 i don't really like that too well i keep telling my husband that our next house is going to sit square in the middle of at least ten acres of land [laughter]
sw2196B-ms98-a-0046 348.318500 357.616125 but uh it's a it's a good size and it's something we can stay in and grow in for quite a while i guess uh hopefully till the real estate market turns around like you we
sw2196B-ms98-a-0047 357.616125 366.165625 we bought when it was down a little bit but we've had so many repossessions in our neighborhood that we couldn't sell for anywhere near what we've got into it so
sw2196B-ms98-a-0048 366.165625 369.359000 it uh hopefully it'll turn around
sw2196B-ms98-a-0049 369.359000 371.140750 sometime
sw2196B-ms98-a-0050 371.140750 384.109750 yeah oh i think it will eventually out here they're building more new houses all the time though and people can go and buy a brand new one that's never been lived in for less than they can get a used one so i guess that's what they would choose
sw2196B-ms98-a-0051 384.109750 385.486125 [silence]
sw2196B-ms98-a-0052 385.486125 398.120625 but there uh w[ell]- as a first time home buyer i know what you mean there's a lot of things you're not sure about what to look out for the only really trouble we've had with our house is the seals breaking between the double panes and wa[ter]- moisture
sw2196B-ms98-a-0053 398.120625 401.577750 gets in there and you can hardly see out of them_1 now they've got so much
sw2196B-ms98-a-0054 401.577750 410.297000 and the builder's gone bankrupt and the glass company's gone bankrupt so we don't really have any recourse and just hope they break or something [laughter]
sw2196B-ms98-a-0055 410.297000 411.857625 [silence]
sw2196B-ms98-a-0056 411.857625 415.845000 yeah but other than that we haven't had any problems
sw2196B-ms98-a-0057 415.845000 419.612375 [silence]
sw2196B-ms98-a-0058 419.612375 420.837375 um-hum

sw2196B-ms98-a-0065 458.731875 472.966375 w[e]- we had um our insurance our home owner's insurance actually covered some of it because_1 i told them it looks like something's eating into the glass it turns like a milky white you know so i said well how do we know it wasn't some kind of chemical or something that's eating into that which would be covered under a glass rider so
sw2196B-ms98-a-0066 472.966375 475.229250 they replaced like seven of them_1
sw2196B-ms98-a-0067 475.229250 477.875875 and we just had to pay the deductible but
sw2196B-ms98-a-0068 477.875875 488.512250 they wouldn't that insurance company went out of business in Texas because they had so many claims that they couldn't make a profit and so now none of the other insurance companies will will consider covering that
sw2196B-ms98-a-0069 488.512250 491.137500 which i can understand it's really not
sw2196B-ms98-a-0070 491.137500 492.221625 [silence]
sw2196B-ms98-a-0071 492.221625 493.305875 damaged

sw2196B-ms98-a-0075 496.977125 500.502375 but i bet we've got at least seven more now that are bad
sw2196B-ms98-a-0076 500.502375 504.173875 just about every window in our house i guess eventually is going to have to be replaced
sw2196B-ms98-a-0077 504.173875 507.519875 [silence]
sw2196B-ms98-a-0078 507.519875 513.662125 yeah well what they did is just they came in and just cut the glass out of the frame and put more glass in
sw2196B-ms98-a-0079 513.662125 517.962500 that's over a year ago and it's it hasn't had any problems yeah seemed to
sw2196B-ms98-a-0080 517.962500 519.693250 [silence]
sw2196B-ms98-a-0081 519.693250 527.800500 somebody told me that they thought that too was caused by just a little bit of shifting in the foundation puts a little pressure on that seal and makes them pop open
sw2196B-ms98-a-0082 527.800500 533.927875 [silence]
