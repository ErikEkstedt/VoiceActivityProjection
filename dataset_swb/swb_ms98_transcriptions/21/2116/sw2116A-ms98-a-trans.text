sw2116A-ms98-a-0002 0.297125 2.235375 well Jerry do you have a favorite team
sw2116A-ms98-a-0003 2.235375 4.989500 [silence]
sw2116A-ms98-a-0004 4.989500 6.658375 Cowboys
sw2116A-ms98-a-0005 6.658375 9.270125 [silence]
sw2116A-ms98-a-0006 9.270125 15.966750 okay well they're rebuilding right now yet i think it's going to take them a couple more years before they can be a really good team
sw2116A-ms98-a-0007 15.966750 30.228625 [silence]
sw2116A-ms98-a-0008 30.228625 31.764000 right
sw2116A-ms98-a-0009 31.764000 37.988875 [silence]
sw2116A-ms98-a-0010 37.988875 41.485750 i think the Cowboys have shown a lot of improvement this uh past year
sw2116A-ms98-a-0011 41.485750 44.791500 [silence]
sw2116A-ms98-a-0012 44.791500 46.283750 okay
sw2116A-ms98-a-0013 46.283750 47.813000 [silence]
sw2116A-ms98-a-0014 47.813000 49.215875 yeah
sw2116A-ms98-a-0015 49.215875 52.493375 [silence]
sw2116A-ms98-a-0016 52.493375 60.433375 okay yeah i think a lot of people had that impression that uh that he ought he should have stayed in the college ranks but uh looks like they're going to do all right
sw2116A-ms98-a-0017 60.433375 61.981625 my
sw2116A-ms98-a-0018 61.981625 66.994625 [silence]
sw2116A-ms98-a-0019 66.994625 76.200625 yeah big shoes to follow [laughter] well my favorite team is a is a sentimental favorite uh the Green Bay Packers i grew up in that area and have been following them
sw2116A-ms98-a-0020 76.200625 77.742125 [silence]
sw2116A-ms98-a-0021 77.742125 81.717375 been following the Packers ever since uh they won the first two Super Bowls
sw2116A-ms98-a-0022 81.717375 87.977875 [silence]
sw2116A-ms98-a-0023 87.977875 90.498375 yeah they sure did i remember those
sw2116A-ms98-a-0024 90.498375 95.238000 [silence]
sw2116A-ms98-a-0025 95.238000 98.468750 yeah i actually know some people that went to the Ice Bowl
sw2116A-ms98-a-0026 98.468750 102.430000 [silence]
sw2116A-ms98-a-0027 102.430000 111.230875 they could have had a good year this year uh unfortunately the quarterback uh controversy they had where Don McCowskey got hurt and couldn't play most the season
sw2116A-ms98-a-0028 111.230875 115.688375 they spent an awful lot of money on him too a million and a half dollars for a one year contract [noise]
sw2116A-ms98-a-0029 115.688375 118.248625 so i don't know if he's going to be in shape to
sw2116A-ms98-a-0030 118.248625 122.183250 [silence]
sw2116A-ms98-a-0031 122.183250 123.273500 uh-huh
sw2116A-ms98-a-0032 123.273500 124.499500 [silence]
sw2116A-ms98-a-0033 124.499500 126.693000 who did you root for in the Super Bowl
sw2116A-ms98-a-0034 126.693000 132.481750 [silence]
sw2116A-ms98-a-0035 132.481750 134.725000 yeah both New York teams
sw2116A-ms98-a-0036 134.725000 135.992875 [silence]
sw2116A-ms98-a-0037 135.992875 138.989250 uh-huh well that turned out to be a good game
sw2116A-ms98-a-0038 138.989250 142.017500 [silence]
sw2116A-ms98-a-0039 142.017500 148.284250 i think Buffalo is an up an coming team they're going to they're showing some real promise for the next uh few years
sw2116A-ms98-a-0040 148.284250 152.479375 the Giants are always uh always there perennially a good team
sw2116A-ms98-a-0041 152.479375 155.211375 [silence]
sw2116A-ms98-a-0042 155.211375 159.759750 i think they had a lot of luck there too with Montana getting hurt in San Francisco
sw2116A-ms98-a-0043 159.759750 166.484375 i think if if he was uh healthy San Francisco would have stomped those guys it wouldn't have been much of a contest
sw2116A-ms98-a-0044 166.484375 170.753750 [silence]
sw2116A-ms98-a-0045 170.753750 173.986250 yeah i think it's getting better more competitive
sw2116A-ms98-a-0046 173.986250 180.265375 uh we see uh teams getting in the play-offs every now and then with uh five hundred records or a little below even
sw2116A-ms98-a-0047 180.265375 188.957250 the uh AFC Central is a lot like that with uh Pittsburgh Cincinnati Cleveland and Houston nobody really dominated that division last year at all
sw2116A-ms98-a-0048 188.957250 196.339125 [silence]
sw2116A-ms98-a-0049 196.339125 197.639500 right
sw2116A-ms98-a-0050 197.639500 202.488750 [silence]
sw2116A-ms98-a-0051 202.488750 207.529750 okay i wasn't living here then so i [laughter-can't] [laughter-talk] [laughter-much] [laughter-about] [laughter-that] [laughter]
sw2116A-ms98-a-0052 207.529750 219.769375 [silence]
sw2116A-ms98-a-0053 219.769375 221.491000 right
sw2116A-ms98-a-0054 221.491000 231.470750 [silence]
sw2116A-ms98-a-0055 231.470750 244.736875 well there's no doubt about that the money's there and the owners are willing to pay if unfortunately uh and you get star players like uh like Joe Montana making four million dollars a year and everybody else wants to match that type of salary now
sw2116A-ms98-a-0056 244.736875 248.253000 and of course the people end up paying for it are the fans
sw2116A-ms98-a-0057 248.253000 250.743875 uh it's no wonder ticket prices are so high
sw2116A-ms98-a-0058 250.743875 253.988000 i don't go to games myself uh uh
sw2116A-ms98-a-0059 253.988000 259.737625 no you you really can't not when it costs twenty six dollars a ticket and uh so much for parking
sw2116A-ms98-a-0060 259.737625 269.718250 [silence]
sw2116A-ms98-a-0061 269.718250 271.247375 sure
sw2116A-ms98-a-0062 271.247375 275.490625 [silence]
sw2116A-ms98-a-0063 275.490625 287.972000 yeah i think the owners have somewhat lost sight on that because uh they are all wealthy people and uh the expect that uh the average Joe is going to be able to to go to a game and uh pay for that type of entertainment
sw2116A-ms98-a-0064 287.972000 294.987125 [silence]
sw2116A-ms98-a-0065 294.987125 296.487000 sure
sw2116A-ms98-a-0066 296.487000 298.776750 [silence]
sw2116A-ms98-a-0067 298.776750 307.481875 yeah it looks like Jerry Jones is trying to make as much money as he can out of this deal uh he's got his own TV show and he opened the Cowboy Corral out in in the parking lot there
sw2116A-ms98-a-0068 307.481875 313.288625 and uh every every opportunity there is to make a dollar he seems to be exploiting that
sw2116A-ms98-a-0069 313.288625 314.977875 [silence]
sw2116A-ms98-a-0070 314.977875 322.467125 i think there's still a lot of distrust for uh for an Arkansas man to come here and own uh uh Tex[as]- a team in Texas 
sw2116A-ms98-a-0071 322.467125 336.463625 and uh i don't think that's going to die very quickly he is getting some support there were a lot of people that are uh that were skeptical and the Cowboys are coming back and they have a pretty good team Troy Aikman looks like to be looks like he's got the star qualities for a quarterback
sw2116A-ms98-a-0072 336.463625 337.998375 [silence]
sw2116A-ms98-a-0073 337.998375 349.473500 yeah well i was surprised at the the way they drafted last year they didn't really didn't go for the uh big offensive lineman or the defensive lineman they're going for the skilled positions so quarterbacks they really
sw2116A-ms98-a-0074 349.473500 353.172750 really didn't need that type of uh player
sw2116A-ms98-a-0075 353.172750 365.963250 [silence]
sw2116A-ms98-a-0076 365.963250 370.768250 yeah they've got an awful lot of good draft picks coming up it's going to be interesting to see what they do with them
sw2116A-ms98-a-0077 370.768250 372.490250 [silence]
sw2116A-ms98-a-0078 372.490250 375.476125 so hopefully we'll see some more improvement
sw2116A-ms98-a-0079 375.476125 387.977125 and uh the other teams in the NFC East uh they're they're getting uh older uh they're going to have to like the Washington Redskins uh that that's an older team and they're going to have to start rebuilding pretty soon too
sw2116A-ms98-a-0080 387.977125 394.487125 looks like we'll reach a point of uh parity there where the Cowboys may start being a little more competitive with the rest of those teams
sw2116A-ms98-a-0081 394.487125 399.244625 i don't know what Philadelphia's going to do without Buddy Ryan it might be interesting to see
sw2116A-ms98-a-0082 399.244625 407.476125 [silence]
sw2116A-ms98-a-0083 407.476125 410.498500 yeah he's uh one of those guys you love to hate
sw2116A-ms98-a-0084 410.498500 412.997875 kind of like uh Jerry Glanville
sw2116A-ms98-a-0085 412.997875 415.257000 [silence]
sw2116A-ms98-a-0086 415.257000 426.527625 yeah they they do pick up the image of a team though uh and they create a lot of excitement locally so i think they're good for the game just because they are diverse and they bring a different attitude
sw2116A-ms98-a-0087 426.527625 429.527875 [silence]
sw2116A-ms98-a-0088 429.527875 432.241125 but uh they're not my favorite people either
sw2116A-ms98-a-0089 432.241125 435.811000 [silence]
sw2116A-ms98-a-0090 435.811000 437.276375 uh-huh
sw2116A-ms98-a-0091 437.276375 439.996000 [silence]
sw2116A-ms98-a-0092 439.996000 442.699000 well Buddy will probably get another job
sw2116A-ms98-a-0093 442.699000 445.748500 [silence]
sw2116A-ms98-a-0094 445.748500 455.256625 oh he's great i saw him play when he as at uh UNLV he was not only the quarterback but the punter and he can punt the ball sixty yards no problem
sw2116A-ms98-a-0095 455.256625 459.260125 [silence]
sw2116A-ms98-a-0096 459.260125 461.495500 he's a very good athlete that is true
sw2116A-ms98-a-0097 461.495500 463.221125 uh-huh
sw2116A-ms98-a-0098 463.221125 469.475250 yeah Philadelphia expected to do a little better this past year unfortunately they uh they got cut a little short
sw2116A-ms98-a-0099 469.475250 474.983375 [silence]
sw2116A-ms98-a-0100 474.983375 476.488625 no
sw2116A-ms98-a-0101 476.488625 484.999625 i like the team i really really like the Eagles a lot but uh Buddy Ryan [laughter] is not one of my favorite people so i wasn't too disappointed to see them lose
sw2116A-ms98-a-0102 484.999625 486.778500 [silence]
sw2116A-ms98-a-0103 486.778500 490.284250 i don't think he's going to get a head coaching job this next year
sw2116A-ms98-a-0104 490.284250 494.303000 he'd be lucky if he can get an assistant uh job someplace
sw2116A-ms98-a-0105 494.303000 499.702375 um he's just one of those guys he's created such a controversy in Philadelphia nobody wants to touch him right now
sw2116A-ms98-a-0106 499.702375 502.478750 [silence]
sw2116A-ms98-a-0107 502.478750 508.274625 i'm sure he will he's not going to have problems there if not in the NFL then in one of the other leagues
sw2116A-ms98-a-0108 508.274625 512.997875 [silence]
sw2116A-ms98-a-0109 512.997875 519.252875 the World Wide Area Football League WWAFL or whatever they call it WWAFL
sw2116A-ms98-a-0110 519.252875 524.736000 yeah i think that the NFL is going to use that league as uh
sw2116A-ms98-a-0111 524.736000 528.470625 uh kind of like as a minor league to recruit players
sw2116A-ms98-a-0112 528.470625 539.490625 [silence]
sw2116A-ms98-a-0113 539.490625 542.642375 not only that but they don't pay the money either
sw2116A-ms98-a-0114 542.642375 546.974750 uh it's very low uh scale compared to the NFL
sw2116A-ms98-a-0115 546.974750 556.474500 [silence]
sw2116A-ms98-a-0116 556.474500 565.488500 right well some people i'm sure the the more talented people in that league are going to try to uh impress NFL scouts with their play in that league
sw2116A-ms98-a-0117 565.488500 579.491375 possibly but that's that's uh one in a million shot if they have the talent to be in the NFL they're going to get drafted and make a pro team there aren't going to be too many people that that'll make uh the NFL out of uh WWALF
sw2116A-ms98-a-0118 579.491375 585.469750 it will be like Italian basketball with the uh with with the uh NBA
sw2116A-ms98-a-0119 585.469750 590.989250 some guys can come back and play in the NBA but most of them don't really don't have the physical skills or the talent
sw2116A-ms98-a-0120 590.989250 595.492375 [silence]
sw2116A-ms98-a-0121 595.492375 598.907000 i think it will be a good year the Cowboys are showing constant [vocalized-noise]
