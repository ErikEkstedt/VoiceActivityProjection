sw2174B-ms98-a-0005 14.800000 18.503750 i i heard that it's been raining down there a little bit but it's really been that bad
sw2174B-ms98-a-0006 18.503750 28.638250 [silence]
sw2174B-ms98-a-0007 28.638250 30.753750 really that bad huh
sw2174B-ms98-a-0008 30.753750 35.608875 is it is it typically this rain[y]- i don't think it's typically this rainy by you down there is it
sw2174B-ms98-a-0009 35.608875 46.745125 [silence]
sw2174B-ms98-a-0010 46.745125 50.590750 oh God i guess you're getting all of California's rain
sw2174B-ms98-a-0011 50.590750 56.960000 [silence]
sw2174B-ms98-a-0012 56.960000 58.196625 right

sw2174B-ms98-a-0014 59.739000 62.270250 oh they're getting another one later in the week there
sw2174B-ms98-a-0015 62.270250 68.559750 there was another one that was another storm um that was supposed to hit them like on Wednesday or something
sw2174B-ms98-a-0016 68.559750 73.095500 so i suspect it'll it'll wind it's way to you afterward
sw2174B-ms98-a-0017 73.095500 75.385125 it's not a pleasant thought
sw2174B-ms98-a-0018 75.385125 76.689250 so
sw2174B-ms98-a-0019 76.689250 78.989375 [silence]
sw2174B-ms98-a-0020 78.989375 80.577250 [laughter]
sw2174B-ms98-a-0021 80.577250 85.198625 well well i can uh i can understand that weather we're having uh
sw2174B-ms98-a-0022 85.198625 90.329625 we are it we had a late um um an ice storm here
sw2174B-ms98-a-0023 90.329625 98.419500 about two weeks ago which is you know um and and it's and it's they're calling it the worst ice storm in like the last hundred years
sw2174B-ms98-a-0024 98.419500 105.611625 and um and then to the point where about three hundred thousand people in our in our area lost power
sw2174B-ms98-a-0025 105.611625 107.017875 and
sw2174B-ms98-a-0026 107.017875 108.533500 [silence]
sw2174B-ms98-a-0027 108.533500 118.372750 yeah oh yeah this is this is um well yeah up here in in in Rochester winter usually doesn't you know spring comes about this time March or April
sw2174B-ms98-a-0028 118.372750 124.766125 and um this was sort of unexpected it had actually been pretty fairly nice you know in the in the forties and um
sw2174B-ms98-a-0029 124.766125 135.865125 it had even been in the uh in the in the low fifties a couple of days in a row and then they actually they predicted it they said well we're going to have an ice storm coming up and then no one knew how bad it was going to be
sw2174B-ms98-a-0030 135.865125 139.601375 and it came in and in one night it basically destroyed
sw2174B-ms98-a-0031 139.601375 148.493750 it destroyed approximately one third of all the vegetation in um in like the three county area by us
sw2174B-ms98-a-0032 148.493750 153.559250 and about half the city owned trees in the city of Rochester are destroyed
sw2174B-ms98-a-0033 153.559250 160.552750 um we ha[ve]- uh i uh um my wife and i own our own home and we have a very big willow tree in our backyard
sw2174B-ms98-a-0034 160.552750 164.848625 that um that ninety percent of which came down in one night
sw2174B-ms98-a-0035 164.848625 168.813500 things like that it was a it it definitely is very um
sw2174B-ms98-a-0036 168.813500 177.360000 it was it was it wasn't supposed to be as bad they they have i g[uess]- i- i guess apparently you know ice storms here occasionally but never anything this bad this late in the season
sw2174B-ms98-a-0037 177.360000 192.131875 [silence]
sw2174B-ms98-a-0038 192.131875 204.259625 oh yeah it was it was utterly amazing i mean we we would um we got up in the morning you know um we didn't we yo[u]- yo[u]- you didn't sleep very well because ev[ery]- all all around you there were crashing sounds and
sw2174B-ms98-a-0039 204.259625 211.842500 and there were sounds of things breaking and you know you look you know we at one point we woke up to the sound of the uh the electric lines being ripped off our house and
sw2174B-ms98-a-0040 211.842500 220.264625 things like that and then you go outside and everything is covered in ice i mean um you're talking about the lawn before being too mushy to mow
sw2174B-ms98-a-0041 220.264625 230.196625 um in our case it was just the opposite i mean the lawn was just a solid sheet of ice each blade of grass had a small individual covering of ice you know um
sw2174B-ms98-a-0042 230.196625 241.148625 maybe you know two or three millimeters thick but thick enough that you could actually see it my car was covered completely in ice it was uh in [vocalized-noise] ice of about a half inch thick at one point
sw2174B-ms98-a-0043 241.148625 243.370500 [silence]
sw2174B-ms98-a-0044 243.370500 244.880500 well it
sw2174B-ms98-a-0045 244.880500 256.883750 [silence]
sw2174B-ms98-a-0046 256.883750 264.604875 yeah um actually it turned out in our case um i know somebody who when they tried to defrost their car cracked their windshield um
sw2174B-ms98-a-0047 264.604875 268.883000 [vocalized-noise] so [vocalized-noise] occasionally it can be a big problem in our case we didn't um 
sw2174B-ms98-a-0048 268.883000 273.415625 we didn't have the problem because my we keep my wife's car in the garage
sw2174B-ms98-a-0049 273.415625 276.615375 so her car didn't get iced over you know it wasn't um
sw2174B-ms98-a-0050 276.615375 287.499500 um it was a little bit cold in her car in the morning but it wasn't iced over [vocalized-noise] so i just left my car out there for a couple of days and um within two or three days it was it was actually warm enough that everything melted
sw2174B-ms98-a-0051 287.499500 291.522750 um it was it was actually one of the most beautiful sights i've ever seen
sw2174B-ms98-a-0052 291.522750 302.271875 because everything looks you know if you can imagine just seeing everything coated in a nice clean sheet of ice and and and it looks really nice the whole whole place but um
sw2174B-ms98-a-0053 302.271875 311.876250 it got you know after the initial storm it got worse as things started to melt because um as things melted branches shifted and started to fall again
sw2174B-ms98-a-0054 311.876250 318.215375 so we're still cleaning up we actually left the last people got power i guess yesterday
sw2174B-ms98-a-0055 318.215375 323.029000 and we left the state of emergency last night or something at like midnight
sw2174B-ms98-a-0056 323.029000 324.091875 [silence]
sw2174B-ms98-a-0057 324.091875 326.802625 so it's it's it's not fun
sw2174B-ms98-a-0058 326.802625 333.500750 [silence]
sw2174B-ms98-a-0059 333.500750 338.908750 strangely enough the roads weren't that the the roads themselves were okay um there wasn't
sw2174B-ms98-a-0060 338.908750 347.486875 given that um sort of things hit and and for some reason i don't i don't quite understand why they i guess m[aybe]- maybe the ice didn't have anything to grab onto the roads themselves weren't 
sw2174B-ms98-a-0061 347.486875 355.555750 weren't like covered in a solid sheet of ice things seemed to be okay um especially given that you know the next day it was forty degrees
sw2174B-ms98-a-0062 355.555750 359.704750 um you know [vocalized-noise] everything started to melt and then the roads themselves
sw2174B-ms98-a-0063 359.704750 372.110625 {icewise} were okay it was just that um there were there were power lines down everywhere on the road and there were trees downed everywhere and wherever you drove was sort of like driving through an obstacle course you didn't want to
sw2174B-ms98-a-0064 372.110625 374.069125 have to wind up hitting um
sw2174B-ms98-a-0065 374.069125 383.336625 you know hitting a tree or hitting a power line or hitting a phone line or anything else that was the rough part of it they closed school for kids for like a week ju[st]- just because of that
sw2174B-ms98-a-0066 383.336625 384.687625 so
sw2174B-ms98-a-0067 384.687625 386.644125 [silence]
sw2174B-ms98-a-0068 386.644125 390.576375 yeah that's what i'm actually told i've i've never experienced a hurricane
sw2174B-ms98-a-0069 390.576375 399.886125 [silence]
sw2174B-ms98-a-0070 399.886125 401.441875 oh God
sw2174B-ms98-a-0071 401.441875 408.789625 yeah well i guess um but typically it down there though you don't get much coldness right you get [vocalized-noise]
sw2174B-ms98-a-0072 408.789625 423.899125 [silence]
sw2174B-ms98-a-0073 423.899125 427.004875 how well when you say cold what do you mean by cold [laughter]
sw2174B-ms98-a-0074 427.004875 430.654250 [silence]
sw2174B-ms98-a-0075 430.654250 439.215750 oh sheesh yeah um um it's right about now when they're talking about hitting thirty five and forty degree days we're thinking heat wave
sw2174B-ms98-a-0076 439.215750 449.102250 because occas[ionally]- what'll what'll happen here is with the wind chill it can go below zero quite often which is not not fun i personally hate it i'm only here for school
sw2174B-ms98-a-0077 449.102250 450.303000 [vocalized-noise]
sw2174B-ms98-a-0078 450.303000 458.357625 [silence]
sw2174B-ms98-a-0079 458.357625 459.336875 uh
sw2174B-ms98-a-0080 459.336875 462.955125 [silence]
sw2174B-ms98-a-0081 462.955125 465.916125 so you don't get the wind chill there that's nice
sw2174B-ms98-a-0082 465.916125 470.504750 that's nice uh i uh my my goal is to move some place south
sw2174B-ms98-a-0083 470.504750 477.000000 so that i don't have to worry about winters any more and just worry about you know an occasional thirty five degree day i can handle but
sw2174B-ms98-a-0084 477.000000 482.254750 the the the the sad part about here is that winter starts in
sw2174B-ms98-a-0085 482.254750 492.645125 um in you know early Sept[ember]- or September October and then it ends in March or April so there isn't that much summer and spring and fall here
sw2174B-ms98-a-0086 492.645125 500.689875 it's pretty much you know lots of winter and uh it's a very long winter semicold winter and a fairly gray winter usually so
sw2174B-ms98-a-0087 500.689875 503.751500 not uh not fun
sw2174B-ms98-a-0088 503.751500 514.988000 [silence]
sw2174B-ms98-a-0089 514.988000 518.061750 is it that low you think uh
sw2174B-ms98-a-0090 518.061750 530.589750 [silence]
sw2174B-ms98-a-0091 530.589750 532.445250 um that's not too ba[d]-
sw2174B-ms98-a-0092 532.445250 540.617250 [silence]
sw2174B-ms98-a-0093 540.617250 541.958250 yeah
sw2174B-ms98-a-0094 541.958250 556.331000 [silence]
sw2174B-ms98-a-0095 556.331000 558.207375 [laughter]
sw2174B-ms98-a-0096 558.207375 559.245250 [silence]
sw2174B-ms98-a-0097 559.245250 563.050000 [laughter] a little barb wire fence huh [laughter]
sw2174B-ms98-a-0098 563.050000 569.312375 well i've only been out uh i've only been in the west once so uh i was in uh i was in Iowa
sw2174B-ms98-a-0099 569.312375 575.906250 and it was bitter cold when i was there and that's the way that's north um that's sort of north
sw2174B-ms98-a-0100 575.906250 576.912250 [silence]
sw2174B-ms98-a-0101 576.912250 578.409750 midwest though
sw2174B-ms98-a-0102 578.409750 584.478500 so way way north of where you are so i i uh my experience wasn't wasn't quite
sw2174B-ms98-a-0103 584.478500 591.366875 down there i i i like i said i want to wind up somewhere down in that range where it's nice and warm and
sw2174B-ms98-a-0104 591.366875 597.380000 you know when when when you get twenty five cold days a year rather than twenty five warm days a year
sw2174B-ms98-a-0105 597.380000 599.775125 which is what we wind up with [vocalized-noise]
