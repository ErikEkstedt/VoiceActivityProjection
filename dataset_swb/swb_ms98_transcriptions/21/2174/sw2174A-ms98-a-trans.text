sw2174A-ms98-a-0003 4.177000 11.091500 if it had rained any more in the last two weeks instead of planting Saint Augustine grass in the front yard i think i would have
sw2174A-ms98-a-0004 11.091500 13.594750 plowed everything under and had a rice field
sw2174A-ms98-a-0005 13.594750 19.231250 [silence]
sw2174A-ms98-a-0006 19.231250 28.623125 it's so bad wanted to mow today i was off and i wanted to mow the yard but just walking across it it's still so mushy if i took a mower out there i'd tear the sod up so bad
sw2174A-ms98-a-0007 28.623125 35.012875 [silence]
sw2174A-ms98-a-0008 35.012875 40.137250 it's steady but it's not in the amounts that we been getting normally we get an inch here and then
sw2174A-ms98-a-0009 40.137250 43.865875 a week or so will pass and you pick up another inch inch and a half
sw2174A-ms98-a-0010 43.865875 47.287375 we're getting hit by three and four inch bursts at a time
sw2174A-ms98-a-0011 47.287375 50.556750 [silence]
sw2174A-ms98-a-0012 50.556750 60.105500 well that's where the front had came come from they said it came out of the Pacific run across California who was really needing the rain it should've it should've stalled over them for a couple more days
sw2174A-ms98-a-0013 60.105500 75.522375 [silence]
sw2174A-ms98-a-0014 75.522375 79.294625 well maybe i maybe i can get the yard mowed before it hits
sw2174A-ms98-a-0015 79.294625 105.596250 [silence]
sw2174A-ms98-a-0016 105.596250 108.891250 isn't it a little late in the season for that type of ice storm though
sw2174A-ms98-a-0017 108.891250 177.618625 [silence]
sw2174A-ms98-a-0018 177.618625 183.915375 yeah i'd seen the storm you were talking about when it hit um up around the Chicago area
sw2174A-ms98-a-0019 183.915375 186.126750 uh they had a
sw2174A-ms98-a-0020 186.126750 191.918375 little film clip about how bad it was up there and i just could not believe how much ice that thing was carrying with it
sw2174A-ms98-a-0021 191.918375 240.907000 [silence]
sw2174A-ms98-a-0022 240.907000 250.475000 how do you thaw one out after it's been coated like that [vocalized-noise] i've always lived down in this part of the country and i'm not used you know we had an ice storm or a sleet and
sw2174A-ms98-a-0023 250.475000 256.901125 a good freeze and the windshield ices over and you take hot water or warm water out of the tap and thaw your windshield
sw2174A-ms98-a-0024 256.901125 328.334250 [silence]
sw2174A-ms98-a-0025 328.334250 333.973750 just hearing what it does to the lawn i hate to even guess what the road conditions would be like in something like that
sw2174A-ms98-a-0026 333.973750 383.460875 [silence]
sw2174A-ms98-a-0027 383.460875 386.965625 sounds like the aftermath of like a hurricane down here
sw2174A-ms98-a-0028 386.965625 391.073750 [silence]
sw2174A-ms98-a-0029 391.073750 396.926750 well we get the same things trees being uprooted limbs falling all over the place power lines getting
sw2174A-ms98-a-0030 396.926750 400.643750 torn completely off the poles being completely pulled out of the ground
sw2174A-ms98-a-0031 400.643750 407.523250 [silence]
sw2174A-ms98-a-0032 407.523250 409.820250 we get maybe
sw2174A-ms98-a-0033 409.820250 412.810625 all winter long we might end up with
sw2174A-ms98-a-0034 412.810625 416.857625 twenty five days of really cold weather and of those
sw2174A-ms98-a-0035 416.857625 420.787875 by the time it [vocalized-noise] gets lunch time
sw2174A-ms98-a-0036 420.787875 424.103750 as as long as the wind's not blowing it's bearable
sw2174A-ms98-a-0037 424.103750 427.518875 [silence]
sw2174A-ms98-a-0038 427.518875 431.453875 uh i think of any thirty five and below as cold
sw2174A-ms98-a-0039 431.453875 448.933625 [silence]
sw2174A-ms98-a-0040 448.933625 456.216250 another thing that saves us during the winter time is if we get a breeze coming straight off the Gulf the wind chill factor
sw2174A-ms98-a-0041 456.216250 463.217375 blows everything out of proportion uh most of the time during the winter that we've got an offshore wind which is blowing straight out
sw2174A-ms98-a-0042 463.217375 504.436375 [silence]
sw2174A-ms98-a-0043 504.436375 508.994500 trying to think where's the warmest the warm lines start i guess probably
sw2174A-ms98-a-0044 508.994500 510.058000 [silence]
sw2174A-ms98-a-0045 510.058000 514.914875 if you're drawing a line across a map of the country put the middle of your ruler on Dallas
sw2174A-ms98-a-0046 514.914875 517.233500 [silence]
sw2174A-ms98-a-0047 517.233500 520.740000 they get snow up there but it's
sw2174A-ms98-a-0048 520.740000 522.252000 [silence]
sw2174A-ms98-a-0049 522.252000 529.870250 it's not a long lasting snow it'll be there they may have a week of it then it warms back up into the high thirties and forties
sw2174A-ms98-a-0050 529.870250 531.029875 [silence]
sw2174A-ms98-a-0051 531.029875 540.338125 you get much above you get much above the Texas border on in that sec[tor]- sector of the map and get up into Oklahoma they've got a little bit longer winter
sw2174A-ms98-a-0052 540.338125 542.198000 they're catching
sw2174A-ms98-a-0053 542.198000 543.479000 all the
sw2174A-ms98-a-0054 543.479000 544.536250 [silence]
sw2174A-ms98-a-0055 544.536250 549.496625 cold breezes coming straight off the Rockies straight across Kansas and Nebraska and there's nothing
sw2174A-ms98-a-0056 549.496625 552.505250 the only thing that stands between Oklahoma
sw2174A-ms98-a-0057 552.505250 559.546500 and Kansas and Nebraska there's a barb wire fence somewhere around Topeka that's the only thing to slow down the wind
