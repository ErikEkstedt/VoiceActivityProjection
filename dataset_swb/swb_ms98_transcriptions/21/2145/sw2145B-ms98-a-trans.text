sw2145B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 2.397625 [silence]
sw2145B-ms98-a-0002 2.397625 4.168000 well i guess i would
sw2145B-ms98-a-0003 4.168000 12.150125 first identify myself as middle aged and therefore having seen the last generation i guess it puts me in you know gives me a perspective on that
sw2145B-ms98-a-0004 12.150125 13.637250 um
sw2145B-ms98-a-0005 13.637250 21.655000 i [vocalized-noise] am quite positive on the things that i have seen happen recently relative to women in
sw2145B-ms98-a-0006 21.655000 25.501875 both in society and in the work place uh
sw2145B-ms98-a-0007 25.501875 26.526250 [silence]
sw2145B-ms98-a-0008 26.526250 33.787500 there's no doubt about the fact that when i f[irst]- was first graduated from college the impression was that
sw2145B-ms98-a-0009 33.787500 41.628125 a woman's career would consist of a childbearing years and perhaps a return to the office but not necessarily
sw2145B-ms98-a-0010 41.628125 46.104250 uh now i think the change that i've seen as much as anything is one where
sw2145B-ms98-a-0011 46.104250 47.119000 [silence]
sw2145B-ms98-a-0012 47.119000 56.281125 couples uh are more carefully planning their intention on how to sh[are]- both share homemaking duties and also how women will
sw2145B-ms98-a-0013 56.281125 61.422750 uh have their children and then deliberately sort of plan how they go back to the work place
sw2145B-ms98-a-0014 61.422750 66.967750 and i guess that's a significant change that of i've both participated in an[d]- and noticed
sw2145B-ms98-a-0015 66.967750 85.417500 [silence]
sw2145B-ms98-a-0016 85.417500 86.641375 uh-huh
sw2145B-ms98-a-0017 86.641375 114.617375 [silence]
sw2145B-ms98-a-0018 114.617375 116.787000 wonder about them in what way
sw2145B-ms98-a-0019 116.787000 130.978625 [silence]
sw2145B-ms98-a-0020 130.978625 132.465750 uh-huh
sw2145B-ms98-a-0021 132.465750 150.407625 [silence]
sw2145B-ms98-a-0022 150.407625 151.875000 uh-huh
sw2145B-ms98-a-0023 151.875000 153.252000 [silence]
sw2145B-ms98-a-0024 153.252000 156.805125 i have not to be honest had much experience
sw2145B-ms98-a-0025 156.805125 162.916125 with children in that situation i i guess one knows one's own [storly/story] and i know
sw2145B-ms98-a-0026 162.916125 169.592250 uh in my children's case it was one where uh pretty much up until
sw2145B-ms98-a-0027 169.592250 173.599375 the older of two was in
sw2145B-ms98-a-0028 173.599375 181.770750 uh let's see i guess basically starting junior high and the younger was in fifth grade when my wife reentered the work force
sw2145B-ms98-a-0029 181.770750 183.004625 um
sw2145B-ms98-a-0030 183.004625 183.907875 [noise]
sw2145B-ms98-a-0031 183.907875 192.304500 so i guess my experience is is just with what we did and and so they didn't really go through the child care route they were able to be home together
sw2145B-ms98-a-0032 192.304500 193.454375 um
sw2145B-ms98-a-0033 193.454375 196.107750 and we never actually experienced that
sw2145B-ms98-a-0034 196.107750 203.134000 what in terms of changes relative to women in the work place and and potential changes over the the next
sw2145B-ms98-a-0035 203.134000 207.212375 generation or so i guess i anticipate um
sw2145B-ms98-a-0036 207.212375 212.755000 an increasing equality uh greater presence of women in management roles
sw2145B-ms98-a-0037 212.755000 213.928000 um
sw2145B-ms98-a-0038 213.928000 214.944000 [silence]
sw2145B-ms98-a-0039 214.944000 217.677875 i don't know whether
sw2145B-ms98-a-0040 217.677875 218.682875 [silence]
sw2145B-ms98-a-0041 218.682875 220.509375 there will be
sw2145B-ms98-a-0042 220.509375 226.668750 an increased amount of of surrogacy that we see i just don't know
sw2145B-ms98-a-0043 226.668750 231.114875 um deliberate childbirth by surrogate mother
sw2145B-ms98-a-0044 231.114875 234.717000 sort of rent a mom to be you know not to be crass about it but uh
sw2145B-ms98-a-0045 234.717000 243.000125 uh whether one might conceive [vocalized-noise] no pun intended of the possibility that there might be a kind of a deliberate uh um
sw2145B-ms98-a-0046 243.000125 244.017375 [silence]
sw2145B-ms98-a-0047 244.017375 246.684375 a professional mother a person
sw2145B-ms98-a-0048 246.684375 253.104750 for instance that and i could you know i could envision a society where that would happen and make an interesting uh
sw2145B-ms98-a-0049 253.104750 259.341875 uh story or whatever i i don't think i have a philosophical problem with that in fact i think it sort of raises
sw2145B-ms98-a-0050 259.341875 264.253125 nurturing and being a mother to what it ought to be which is a respected profession
sw2145B-ms98-a-0051 264.253125 265.828375 uh um
sw2145B-ms98-a-0052 265.828375 271.689375 i i don't have a other than than a reading and and male perspective on on
sw2145B-ms98-a-0053 271.689375 276.337250 the var[ious]- on the biological urges involved relative to being a mother or not
sw2145B-ms98-a-0054 276.337250 279.889625 uh i know that that my sense is that i have
sw2145B-ms98-a-0055 279.889625 284.697500 very much an interest and had one in being a parent i i don't know that i
sw2145B-ms98-a-0056 284.697500 289.228875 uh felt myself necessarily encumbered with the necessity to have heirs
sw2145B-ms98-a-0057 289.228875 298.218250 uh i don't have boys that doesn't didn't bother me never has vision more women deliberately raising children either in surrogacy or
sw2145B-ms98-a-0058 298.218250 301.132500 or as a professional nanny nanny as you put it uh
sw2145B-ms98-a-0059 301.132500 308.520000 maybe we'll see a growth in that where someone makes uh a career out of say taking care of five or six children as opposed to day care
sw2145B-ms98-a-0060 308.520000 312.036625 it would be a sort of day care but it would be more of a family setting
sw2145B-ms98-a-0061 312.036625 315.399500 um i know that there are young people
sw2145B-ms98-a-0062 315.399500 320.824625 characterized i guess as being half my age so that by definition that means they're young uh
sw2145B-ms98-a-0063 320.824625 324.638125 that in my work place who are both of them earning rather
sw2145B-ms98-a-0064 324.638125 328.144750 decent professional salaries who probably would consider paying
sw2145B-ms98-a-0065 328.144750 334.896875 a woman uh eight or nine or ten thousand dollars a year to take care of their child i could easily envision that pardon
sw2145B-ms98-a-0066 334.896875 345.601250 or to put their child into a s[etting]- into a home setting where they would you know like they they would get leave at eight in the morning and and drop a two year old off in a home where you knew there were going to be four other kids and
sw2145B-ms98-a-0067 345.601250 348.436875 and you were paying for really high quality care
sw2145B-ms98-a-0068 348.436875 349.866000 uh i have
sw2145B-ms98-a-0069 349.866000 357.667125 acquaintances of mine where i know that they are paying figures on on the order of what i quoted to someone because that's what the experience they want
sw2145B-ms98-a-0070 357.667125 365.519500 and i would imagine if there are more of people like that with an opportunity that that's a possibility of a change that we could see in the next few years
sw2145B-ms98-a-0071 365.519500 374.271250 [silence]
sw2145B-ms98-a-0072 374.271250 376.353625 um-hum um-hum

sw2145B-ms98-a-0074 379.522375 384.054625 i haven't ever really looked at them are you aware at all of of what they would what they cost
sw2145B-ms98-a-0075 384.054625 394.200000 [silence]
sw2145B-ms98-a-0076 394.200000 395.387250 uh-huh

sw2145B-ms98-a-0080 410.767375 411.970250 uh-huh
sw2145B-ms98-a-0081 411.970250 418.634375 what
sw2145B-ms98-a-0082 418.634375 423.648375 what do you envision for the next twenty years as far as women in American society
sw2145B-ms98-a-0083 423.648375 432.865375 [silence]
sw2145B-ms98-a-0084 432.865375 434.475750 that's okay too
sw2145B-ms98-a-0085 434.475750 443.044625 [silence]
sw2145B-ms98-a-0086 443.044625 444.198125 uh-huh

sw2145B-ms98-a-0088 464.128500 473.549500 i'm i'm noticing that too and and i notice the the a terming [vocalized-noise] emerging called solo parents that i am very aware of
sw2145B-ms98-a-0089 473.549500 478.207000 the number of solo mothers that that i encounter in the work place and that that is a little troublesome
sw2145B-ms98-a-0090 478.207000 482.771875 uh because the pressures on them are are rather rather formidable
sw2145B-ms98-a-0091 482.771875 488.670875 uh and maybe that's a change we'll see maybe uh p[ossibility]- the possibility of of women
sw2145B-ms98-a-0092 488.670875 494.584375 uh who deliberately say no we'll let the man will take care of the children perhaps in the event of a separation or whatever
sw2145B-ms98-a-0093 494.584375 496.017125 so
sw2145B-ms98-a-0094 496.017125 501.532750 well i think we're about done okay uh good bye
sw2145B-ms98-a-0095 501.532750 503.660875 you take care bye
