sw2101A-ms98-a-0035 128.779375 134.020875 Eureka's Castle it's called it's just like a Sesame Street show but

sw2101A-ms98-a-0037 134.432625 137.248125 and they watch a couple of shows like that
sw2101A-ms98-a-0038 137.248125 141.628125 but i don't watch any daytime TV at all
sw2101A-ms98-a-0039 141.628125 142.777375 [silence]
sw2101A-ms98-a-0040 142.777375 144.560375 and uh

sw2101A-ms98-a-0046 164.693000 166.181250 oh
sw2101A-ms98-a-0047 166.181250 171.949125 [silence]
sw2101A-ms98-a-0048 171.949125 173.662875 oh that's nice
sw2101A-ms98-a-0049 173.662875 176.246875 [silence]
sw2101A-ms98-a-0050 176.246875 177.889375 uh-huh

sw2101A-ms98-a-0054 194.531125 195.667875 [laughter]
sw2101A-ms98-a-0055 195.667875 197.765875 that sounds like a good idea
sw2101A-ms98-a-0056 197.765875 210.930875 i notice that um since we moved here that we we did get the cable TV and when the newspaper comes out on Sunday i sometimes read through the movies that will be listed
sw2101A-ms98-a-0057 210.930875 219.092000 and i record some and then uh we have just totally cut down and we never go to like a video tape rental anymore because
sw2101A-ms98-a-0058 219.092000 226.185125 there's always plenty of things that we can record and then watch and then record over it something else
sw2101A-ms98-a-0059 226.185125 236.616000 and so that's been really nice because if you decide one evening you would like to stay home and have a quiet evening and watch a movie then you have two or three saved
sw2101A-ms98-a-0060 236.616000 237.622625 [silence]

sw2101A-ms98-a-0064 243.900375 245.927125 [silence]
sw2101A-ms98-a-0065 245.927125 252.167625 well that's probably what i watch most frequently besides like news programs is
sw2101A-ms98-a-0066 252.167625 258.749750 the movies and they have a couple of channels that are like nostalgic older movies
sw2101A-ms98-a-0067 258.749750 265.045625 that i have really enjoyed that i'm seeing for the first time [laughter] like the Marx Brothers [noise] and things like that
sw2101A-ms98-a-0068 265.045625 267.741500 [noise]
sw2101A-ms98-a-0069 267.741500 269.256750 [noise] uh-huh
sw2101A-ms98-a-0070 269.256750 280.138750 right and so we we have really enjoyed that and it's really nice not to be running out some of the video rentals can be expensive and
sw2101A-ms98-a-0071 280.138750 281.467250 and
sw2101A-ms98-a-0072 281.467250 282.790625 [silence]
sw2101A-ms98-a-0073 282.790625 296.884625 um-hum right going and paying six dollars for a ticket for one person at the theater or something so we i have and it's so convenient at home and you can do it anytime y[ou]- you take the notion
sw2101A-ms98-a-0074 296.884625 306.284750 and so i have really enjoyed that but but there are i do have friends that watch programs like they want to see a particular program and
sw2101A-ms98-a-0075 306.284750 313.377875 they are either home watching it or definitely recording it they have some programs that they won't miss
sw2101A-ms98-a-0076 313.377875 315.044000 [silence]
sw2101A-ms98-a-0077 315.044000 316.999125 [laughter]
sw2101A-ms98-a-0078 316.999125 318.064000 [silence]
sw2101A-ms98-a-0079 318.064000 322.138875 yes well and things are repeated
sw2101A-ms98-a-0080 322.138875 324.215000 so often that
sw2101A-ms98-a-0081 324.215000 333.795000 you know if if i have seen just a program once chances are it'll be that exact same show [laughter] if i ever decide to tune it in again
sw2101A-ms98-a-0082 333.795000 337.348625 the only one i've ever seen and it'll be showing again
sw2101A-ms98-a-0083 337.348625 339.224000 pretty funny
sw2101A-ms98-a-0084 339.224000 350.670625 but uh TV is something that we try to not um deliberately try not to get hung up on it like you say
sw2101A-ms98-a-0085 350.670625 353.461500 [silence]
sw2101A-ms98-a-0086 353.461500 362.103000 um-hum and we don't want our kids to to grow up thinking that that's what you do with your spare time
sw2101A-ms98-a-0087 362.103000 364.858250 so it's a little bit
sw2101A-ms98-a-0088 364.858250 372.577000 something we try doing and there's there's a lot of good children's programs that you could watch they could watch several hours every day
sw2101A-ms98-a-0089 372.577000 384.093875 and you could say oh that's a good program for them because_1 it's educational but still you want them_1 to go out and do other things even if they're good programs you don't want them_1 sitting there watching them
sw2101A-ms98-a-0090 384.093875 386.141875 anyway
sw2101A-ms98-a-0091 386.141875 387.675000 well
sw2101A-ms98-a-0092 387.675000 388.936750 [silence]
sw2101A-ms98-a-0093 388.936750 395.259875 yeah that was pretty good i- i like that and um i guess it's time to go
sw2101A-ms98-a-0094 395.259875 399.604875 yes nice to have spoken with you too bye-bye
