sw2108B-ms98-a-0002 2.982875 10.463250 well i've been camping a number of uh of state parks as it were and one of the
sw2108B-ms98-a-0003 10.463250 16.481625 the first ones that i ever went out with was with another group of people there were some uh college students uh
sw2108B-ms98-a-0004 16.481625 24.990250 uh out on a camp out and there were probably ten or fifteen little tents strung in a row on a little peninsula sticking out into Lake Texoma
sw2108B-ms98-a-0005 24.990250 32.015500 and the wind started blowing and it was one of my earlier trips to be really out in the middle of
sw2108B-ms98-a-0006 32.015500 40.719875 no where as far as wind breaks go and and we had secured tents real well even if we had done it in the dark at eleven o'clock at night
sw2108B-ms98-a-0007 40.719875 44.987250 and uh oh i guess an hour into my
sw2108B-ms98-a-0008 44.987250 56.473500 somewhat sleep a guy woke me up and uh said you'd better get out of the the tent they're they're liable to come down several of the others had already come down blown down they hadn't blown away but they had flattened
sw2108B-ms98-a-0009 56.473500 69.955875 and i said okay i didn't you know was kind of groggy didn't know what was going on and crawled out of that tent and uh sure enough uh shortly after that they blew down so we're out here in the pitch dark in this wind and it starts to rain
sw2108B-ms98-a-0010 69.955875 79.234875 and we managed to uh fortunately the rain didn't last long but we managed to get them all back up and uh got some sleep in that night and
sw2108B-ms98-a-0011 79.234875 81.459000 after we got uh
sw2108B-ms98-a-0012 81.459000 94.474125 back from the weekend we checked with one of the parents of one of the other college kids and they were a little concerned they had heard on the radio that the winds on the dam there anyway had gotten up to ninety seven miles an hour straight winds and
sw2108B-ms98-a-0013 94.474125 102.220875 and we could believe that we were out in that at that time and it uh it can be quite a horror story i guess and i

sw2108B-ms98-a-0051 359.550000 371.300875 yeah i uh uh i've been mainly with groups of people and uh sometimes with a family here and there a couple of families get together but mainly it college age kids and
sw2108B-ms98-a-0052 371.300875 383.496875 uh on this one weekend where the tents blew down that same weekend we had one one college kid that yeah he thought he wanted to come and then when he got there it was a little more boring and you know that place doesn't have a whole lot to do up there
sw2108B-ms98-a-0053 383.496875 395.781250 and uh he sat in his car most of the time and and uh listened to his tapes and fortunately he didn't keep them crank them up too loud but he uh he stayed in the car and did what he could have done at home as it were
sw2108B-ms98-a-0054 395.781250 403.274875 and it was no surprise when Sunday rolls around and the car won't start and then you listened to tapes all weekend you know
sw2108B-ms98-a-0055 403.274875 407.259750 it doesn't take much but uh we got him all back going and
sw2108B-ms98-a-0056 407.259750 421.496875 packed up and came on back uh let's see i i had another another camp out that wasn't uh near as bad in fact it had some really good good points to it i'm trying to think of exactly where we were
sw2108B-ms98-a-0057 421.496875 431.267125 uh we were on another lake i don't remember the the name of it but we were right up at the shore and the way it was layed out the camp grounds were
sw2108B-ms98-a-0058 431.267125 441.230000 uh it was another state park and the campgrounds had railroad ties blocking off a sandy pit and that made for a fairly level place to put the tent
sw2108B-ms98-a-0059 441.230000 453.692250 but to get down to the beach you had to walk down a real steep embankment i mean it was so steep they had put railroad ties as stair steps every once in a while mainly for the erosion and that became a path as it were
sw2108B-ms98-a-0060 453.692250 464.974125 but the beach was beautiful we managed to comb out some of the broken glass and the like but the actual sand was a real good quality and real deep and we set up the old volleyball net and you know just a typical
sw2108B-ms98-a-0061 464.974125 471.652375 uh twenty or thirty guys playing volleyball on the beach and this this cove this beach was a bit of a cove
sw2108B-ms98-a-0062 471.652375 485.477750 and it was surrounded oh i'd say a couple of hundred yards by uh this hill this mountainous uh rock terrain and only that little bitty section of it was actually beach the rest of it was water right up against the rock
sw2108B-ms98-a-0063 485.477750 499.185875 so you pretty well had the whole area to yourself there were enough of us where we filled the whole peninsula as far as the the camping on both sides so we di[d]- we all had to walk down to the one area to go down to the beach and it was pretty much the whole area to ourself
sw2108B-ms98-a-0064 499.185875 503.936000 beautiful weekend however at that time at that stage in our life our kids were
sw2108B-ms98-a-0065 503.936000 514.991250 were uh real young and one of them managed to catch diarrhea while we were there so we'd have to run him up the the hill and you know the little portable toilet was up there and
sw2108B-ms98-a-0066 514.991250 523.222875 and uh it was a little bit to bulky to bring all the way down to the to the beach with us and we probably should have found some way to do that or
sw2108B-ms98-a-0067 523.222875 534.996125 but uh and it was hot and we had a little trouble keeping ice it didn't last as long as we had planned so we had to buy that a little more often but uh the beach just couldn't uh couldn't have been any better a good place to dive for balls 
sw2108B-ms98-a-0068 534.996125 548.952625 [silence]
sw2108B-ms98-a-0069 548.952625 558.030000 yeah you have to get pretty far out of the Dallas area to uh be able to see the stars and uh we do that on the camp outs 
sw2108B-ms98-a-0070 558.030000 559.994750 yeah
sw2108B-ms98-a-0071 559.994750 561.494625 yeah
