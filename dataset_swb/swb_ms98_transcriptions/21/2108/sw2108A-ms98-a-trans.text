sw2108A-ms98-a-0017 97.991625 99.491375 [silence]
sw2108A-ms98-a-0018 99.491375 113.228625 that was a bad a bad place to be especially right there on the water at night especially if it i mean if it were summer you're all right because it probably wasn't too cold but uh probably the worst one that ever happened to me was in when i lived in South Dakota
sw2108A-ms98-a-0019 113.228625 117.218750 um i was stationed at Ellsworth there at Rapid City
sw2108A-ms98-a-0020 117.218750 126.973250 and it's right there at the Black Hills and i just absolutely love the Black Hills it's the greatest place in the world to go camping you throw a pack on your back and get up in the mountains
sw2108A-ms98-a-0021 126.973250 132.779250 and you can understand how the Indians got real religious up there because it's just it's just awesome up there
sw2108A-ms98-a-0022 132.779250 147.283250 so quiet and peaceful and the wind blowing through the trees and all that i had a favorite little camping spot i used to go to it was uh right next to a stream and all the streams of of course are mountain fed melted snow
sw2108A-ms98-a-0023 147.283250 156.710625 so it's nice and ice cold a good place to keep your eggs and stuff and this little place was uh it was a per[fect]- a perfect circle of trees
sw2108A-ms98-a-0024 156.710625 168.466750 it was almost like they were intentionally planted that way and i would camp right in the middle of this thing and it provided shelter and everything else it was just absolutely terrific well
sw2108A-ms98-a-0025 168.466750 175.469000 the winters are pretty tough up there and right around March i start get cabin fever
sw2108A-ms98-a-0026 175.469000 187.752625 and i say oh man i got to go camping so throw all the stuff in the car and of course being the careful camper that i am i carried my uh propane heater with me and a couple bottles of propane
sw2108A-ms98-a-0027 187.752625 196.701000 and so i get my tent up and i get my fire place built and all that and i'm just having a good time and uh that night
sw2108A-ms98-a-0028 196.701000 202.746500 it got down to seventeen degrees below zero and snowed
sw2108A-ms98-a-0029 202.746500 208.227625 and i'm sitting in this tent in my sleeping bag freezing
sw2108A-ms98-a-0030 208.227625 216.954375 so i said oh time to get this heater cranked up so i cranked up the heater and this things going of course i got it going full bore
sw2108A-ms98-a-0031 216.954375 226.171375 i run out of propane so here it is about three o'clock in the morning and i've got to hike back to my car to get more propane
sw2108A-ms98-a-0032 226.171375 232.749500 well across the stream there's a fallen log that you have to walk across to get into this little place
sw2108A-ms98-a-0033 232.749500 239.692500 and i'm crossing over the top of this thing it's snowing the thing is slippery and of course i slipped and fell in
sw2108A-ms98-a-0034 239.692500 251.973875 so at three o'clock in the morning i'm up to my neck in freezing ice cold water and i can just feel my heart just you know scrunch right up the size of a pecan
sw2108A-ms98-a-0035 251.973875 266.488875 so i finally drug myself out of that i just got in the car and drove home i left everything sitting there i just got just got in the car went home got uh got a nice hot shower uh i got some dry clothes on and then went back
sw2108A-ms98-a-0036 266.488875 269.487625 that was probably the worst thing that ever happened
sw2108A-ms98-a-0037 269.487625 271.984000 [silence]
sw2108A-ms98-a-0038 271.984000 284.617000 [laughter] [vocalized-noise] it's fun though that that was i just absolutely loved it up there that whole part of the country was great went to uh Glacier National Park a couple of times and
sw2108A-ms98-a-0039 284.617000 298.454000 Yellowstone Yellowstone is just too crowded though it's not a lot of fun with a whole bunch of people around and these stupid bears i mean they're almost tame they come up begging for hand outs you know course i'm 
sw2108A-ms98-a-0040 298.454000 301.734000 [silence]
sw2108A-ms98-a-0041 301.734000 313.195375 well that's true and and it's sad because now they they're so used to people they're going into the towns and raiding garbage cans and stuff and that presents a threat to the people living there and now they're having to shoot them_1
sw2108A-ms98-a-0042 313.195375 324.495625 you know i mean it's sad because those those bears were doing fine until we got there you know and now they're now we're killing them because of something that some monster that we created
sw2108A-ms98-a-0043 324.495625 330.995250 so i don't know it upsets me a little bit i like bears they're pretty they're pretty cool
sw2108A-ms98-a-0044 330.995250 332.494625 [silence]
sw2108A-ms98-a-0045 332.494625 338.643875 yeah and to me Yellowstone was just too uh commercialized
sw2108A-ms98-a-0046 338.643875 349.485250 i mean it it's it's got some areas that are really nice but i mean you get up there and everything is just you know you know souvenirs and all this kind of junk
sw2108A-ms98-a-0047 349.485250 358.990500 and i i sort of i like the really raw land you know go out and where no man has gone before and that sort of thing
