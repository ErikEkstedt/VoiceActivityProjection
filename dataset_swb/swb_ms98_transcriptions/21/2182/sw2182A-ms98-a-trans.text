sw2182A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 6.992750 well the roles of women have certainly changed over the last uh decade or two and
sw2182A-ms98-a-0002 6.992750 19.489000 i wonder if the the stresses that it puts on the the woman's body is uh all that good for her as it were had had there been enough adjustments in society
sw2182A-ms98-a-0003 19.489000 24.498625 to help the woman cope with what she has to go through um
sw2182A-ms98-a-0004 24.498625 37.993750 support group wise or or just all the different aspects that men have developed over the years to handle what the world does to them uh how how is the woman's world coming along in that respect
sw2182A-ms98-a-0005 37.993750 118.485500 [silence]
sw2182A-ms98-a-0006 118.485500 123.281000 do you think a matter of choice or economics both
sw2182A-ms98-a-0007 123.281000 134.233000 [silence]
sw2182A-ms98-a-0008 134.233000 135.489750 uh-huh
sw2182A-ms98-a-0009 135.489750 142.010000 [silence]
sw2182A-ms98-a-0010 142.010000 144.229500 yeah that's true
sw2182A-ms98-a-0011 144.229500 152.496500 you know that's an interesting point that you brought up about the the fact that they essentially always have been under stress uh i would say more
sw2182A-ms98-a-0012 152.496500 158.994125 in the later latter years even those who stayed home had stress but when you're
sw2182A-ms98-a-0013 158.994125 172.212125 the one or the two out of ten women staying home on the block uh then the stresses that you do have uh the normal day-to-day stresses caring for children or whatever is occurring
sw2182A-ms98-a-0014 172.212125 185.937000 uh you could go to at one time one era you could go to the other dozens of wives on the block or you could meet for tea or whatever and you had that stress relief uh built in
sw2182A-ms98-a-0015 185.937000 193.979000 uh whereas now with it's a kind of fifty fifty split or leaning whatever percentage happens to be in your neighborhood like for our neighborhood we're looking at
sw2182A-ms98-a-0016 193.979000 203.696375 ninety percent working women let's say uh there's no place for the wife to go when she has uh those kind of of stresses to be relieved
sw2182A-ms98-a-0017 203.696375 205.218125 so
sw2182A-ms98-a-0018 205.218125 215.998125 [silence]
sw2182A-ms98-a-0019 215.998125 228.279625 that's right about two months ago Omni Magazine which is a a science magazine are you familiar with that read an article um really restating some conclusions of some some uh
sw2182A-ms98-a-0020 228.279625 238.216000 programs or some investigations or research whatever you want to call it into the the actual physical differences between men and women and questioning whether those physical differences
sw2182A-ms98-a-0021 238.216000 244.454375 uh accounted for some of the differences in ways women handled stress as opposed to men
sw2182A-ms98-a-0022 244.454375 249.712875 and i guess to just barely summarize what the article said
sw2182A-ms98-a-0023 249.712875 264.463000 was that in the the womb the differing levels of testosterone and estrogen across the lower part of the brain the base of the brain affected essentially how the brain was connected to the rest of the body
sw2182A-ms98-a-0024 264.463000 277.984125 uh now how that has to deal with stress i'm not really sure since i thought most of the stress had to do with you know from the from the eyes and the mental processes on up i don't know what it would have to do with the connectivity to the rest of the body
sw2182A-ms98-a-0025 277.984125 285.350125 but it was an interesting uh uh line of reasoning where we've always thought or been told especially by the [vocalized-noise]
sw2182A-ms98-a-0026 285.350125 294.499375 for lack of a better term women's libber you know we're just the same as men well maybe not and and maybe you shouldn't be exposed to the stress the same way that men have
sw2182A-ms98-a-0027 294.499375 306.249125 have managed to do all these years and maybe it will take a lot longer before the phy[sical]- physical evolution or for lack of a better term will occur to allow you to handle what we've put ourselves through
sw2182A-ms98-a-0028 306.249125 346.750625 [silence]
sw2182A-ms98-a-0029 346.750625 348.286000 right
sw2182A-ms98-a-0030 348.286000 387.723625 [silence]
sw2182A-ms98-a-0031 387.723625 388.974625 right
sw2182A-ms98-a-0032 388.974625 417.953875 [silence]
sw2182A-ms98-a-0033 417.953875 430.402750 yeah the subject would die before they had to run all the tests that they need [laughter] [laughter-that's] it would be an exhausted test uh how about the the area of role models or roles as it were when you
sw2182A-ms98-a-0034 430.402750 436.475375 you know teach the boy that uh he fixes the car and the woman fixes the meal uh
sw2182A-ms98-a-0035 436.475375 444.003625 not not arguing that there should be a role for a sex but should there be
sw2182A-ms98-a-0036 444.003625 454.984750 uh a set of not not a specific role let's say let's not say that only the the girls should do the cooking but at any given generation or for any given
sw2182A-ms98-a-0037 454.984750 464.173375 uh compatibility if you want a couple to be together shouldn't they have uh defined roles as it were
sw2182A-ms98-a-0038 464.173375 471.746875 uh certainly capable of sharing the other role for nothing more than empathy i mean it you know at least they understand what the other person is going through
sw2182A-ms98-a-0039 471.746875 482.276375 uh not being a tremendous cook i- i know what the burden of preparing a meal but i don't know what [vocalized-noise] it would have taken to make that meal taste any better out on the budget i give her that kind of deal
sw2182A-ms98-a-0040 482.276375 483.167125 [noise]
sw2182A-ms98-a-0041 483.167125 495.997750 so i- i wonder i don't have any argument or any problem with women changing a given role as long as there's something on the other side let's say of of any relationship to
sw2182A-ms98-a-0042 495.997750 500.242625 to match that i mean you don't want two people doing the same thing in the relationship
sw2182A-ms98-a-0043 500.242625 501.830375 so
sw2182A-ms98-a-0044 501.830375 572.996000 [silence]
sw2182A-ms98-a-0045 572.996000 574.495375 uh-huh
sw2182A-ms98-a-0046 574.495375 575.830000 [silence]
sw2182A-ms98-a-0047 575.830000 577.253875 yeah i
sw2182A-ms98-a-0048 577.253875 578.492125 [silence]
sw2182A-ms98-a-0049 578.492125 591.467375 i- i know one that's st[ill]- that way but that's about it i'm down to one friend that holds that position still i'm the only one home right now and i i have the kids clamoring for my attention now so i understand what that's like
sw2182A-ms98-a-0050 591.467375 597.024875 [silence]
sw2182A-ms98-a-0051 597.024875 600.795125 now that's an interesting point yeah i mean once the expectations are
