sw2165A-ms98-a-0097 402.345125 411.635125 they have as far as i'm concerned because i'm i'm not a big vegetable eater they have too many uh yellow vegetables on the same day and
sw2165A-ms98-a-0098 411.635125 416.310000 and it s[eems]- seems like it's it's a variety of the same type of vegetable 
sw2165A-ms98-a-0099 416.310000 418.766375 like they'll have uh
sw2165A-ms98-a-0100 418.766375 425.555750 they'll have broccoli and they'll have squash and cauliflower all on the same day
