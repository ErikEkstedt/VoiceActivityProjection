sw2165B-ms98-a-0037 163.813625 176.270125 and uh we're you know not into the corn bread as much so our stuffing was um lot of times was uh like sausage or what not we would make it with you know varied uh meats like that
sw2165B-ms98-a-0038 176.270125 181.517375 inside the turkey and then of course we always had to have mashed potatoes
