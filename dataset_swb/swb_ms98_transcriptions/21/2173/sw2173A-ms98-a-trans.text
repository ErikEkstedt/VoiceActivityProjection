sw2173A-ms98-a-0038 135.677875 142.696875 i started watching it and to this day i still watch it i just kind of got caught in that and then after i moved out of the dorm
sw2173A-ms98-a-0039 142.696875 157.512000 my roommates watched General Hospital and they watched All My Children and some other soaps and i was going i'm not even going to be near that TV when they have any other soap on because i don't want to get stuck in another [laughter-one] one is bad enough no more [laughter] but uh

sw2173A-ms98-a-0058 217.534875 232.016500 course see four hours of soap operas is really going to translate into about two hours of TV watching time because they're really half of it is just commercials they play more commercials in soap operas than anything i've ever seen in my life but still i just don't think i could sit down for two hours
sw2173A-ms98-a-0059 232.016500 240.272000 and especially two hours of soap operas i'd that'd be that might be a real good way just to break that habit is to have to watch them for that long i'd kind of be like uh
sw2173A-ms98-a-0060 240.272000 246.082125 this is enough [laughter] i can't take this any more [laughter] this is disgusting [laughter]

sw2173A-ms98-a-0068 261.798375 271.973750 yeah yeah i think so i mean i guess that's the only one i've ever watched and i just i refused to i mean i never watched Dallas or Knots Landing or any of those things because it's like
sw2173A-ms98-a-0069 271.973750 275.127375 i don't want to get hooked into one of these things that you have to watch it every week
sw2173A-ms98-a-0070 275.127375 282.058000 i mean you can watch Coach from time to time and not have to you know not feel like oh wait i'm missing an episode and i won't know what's going on
sw2173A-ms98-a-0071 282.058000 286.202250 and so that's fine and i like LA Law too that's another one

sw2173A-ms98-a-0088 342.717500 352.050500 and the guys from downstairs who by the way two of them were from San Antonio there were three of us girls upstairs and three guys downstairs and they'd come upstairs and watch it with us and we'd all sit there and
sw2173A-ms98-a-0089 352.050500 359.036250 you know we'd be yelling and going pick this one pick this one and we just had it was just a fun you know fun thing to watch but uh

sw2173A-ms98-a-0091 360.638625 372.508000 kind of yeah but they have the three choices on video and it's usually real funny because they'll usually get someone in there that half the time the dates didn't work out at all and they have to tell about their date and how it went and 
sw2173A-ms98-a-0092 372.508000 384.224000 half the time they'll say well when he showed up at the door he didn't really look quite like his video and i just wasn't real sometimes they really burn each other it's really kind of [laughter-funny] but
sw2173A-ms98-a-0093 384.224000 397.326625 yeah well then if the other person hears something like that they come back just as bad [laughter] and he'll say well she underestimated her weight by quite a bit [laughter] and they they just got you know they they go back and forth and it's kind of funny um
sw2173A-ms98-a-0094 397.326625 403.058125 and then you'll see the real funny looking couples and it's it's it was just entertaining and of course that was
