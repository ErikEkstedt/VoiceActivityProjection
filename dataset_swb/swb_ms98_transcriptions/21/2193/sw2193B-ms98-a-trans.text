sw2193B-ms98-a-0002 0.839250 6.342625 all right well what do you think about women's role's in the last generation what uh what changes have you seen
sw2193B-ms98-a-0003 6.342625 36.218500 [silence]
sw2193B-ms98-a-0004 36.218500 41.660125 well yeah yeah i would imagine women would understand maternity a lot better than men [laughter]
sw2193B-ms98-a-0005 41.660125 45.012375 we only have to get up for you know for the daytime feedings
sw2193B-ms98-a-0006 45.012375 51.962875 [silence]
sw2193B-ms98-a-0007 51.962875 57.803875 well i've noticed that it seems uh some women are i guess what i call the [feministus/feminists]
sw2193B-ms98-a-0008 57.803875 60.350250 you know or you know very
sw2193B-ms98-a-0009 60.350250 71.001750 strong uh you know women's libbers and others that don't want to be and it's it's confusing trying to figure out which one is which yeah you don't know whether to call Ms or Mrs you know
sw2193B-ms98-a-0010 71.001750 72.061000 [silence]
sw2193B-ms98-a-0011 72.061000 72.952750 yeah
sw2193B-ms98-a-0012 72.952750 76.115250 i think they should all wear signs you know or something
sw2193B-ms98-a-0013 76.115250 77.304250 but uh
sw2193B-ms98-a-0014 77.304250 81.963000 i- i- i found it interesting especially uh being from a military background
sw2193B-ms98-a-0015 81.963000 85.492500 the current fuss over whether women should go into combat or not
sw2193B-ms98-a-0016 85.492500 87.468875 [silence]
sw2193B-ms98-a-0017 87.468875 91.568375 [vocalized-noise] i can't figure anybody who would voluntarily want to go
sw2193B-ms98-a-0018 91.568375 93.855250 if you can stay out of it although i guess
sw2193B-ms98-a-0019 93.855250 99.426875 although i did notice that all the ones who were saying women should have to be in combat were too old and fat to go
sw2193B-ms98-a-0020 99.426875 101.558750 [silence]
sw2193B-ms98-a-0021 101.558750 115.728875 now it's kind of like when the men do you course you you used to saying used to be the old men declare the war and the young men fight it and now and now it's it's i'm happy to see that the women have the same problem that the men has had because they got the old fat women yelling well yeah they ought to fight but course they don't have to go
sw2193B-ms98-a-0022 115.728875 117.173875 [silence]
sw2193B-ms98-a-0023 117.173875 122.484375 i always wanted to put Gloria Steinem on a set of camels and send her over to the Gulf and let her fight but
sw2193B-ms98-a-0024 122.484375 132.517125 [silence]
sw2193B-ms98-a-0025 132.517125 134.960625 well they couldn't be worse than some of the men
sw2193B-ms98-a-0026 134.960625 136.140000 [silence]
sw2193B-ms98-a-0027 136.140000 138.369000 i think it all depends on mental set more than sex
sw2193B-ms98-a-0028 138.369000 154.006125 [silence]
sw2193B-ms98-a-0029 154.006125 160.333125 well if i think if you know regardless of sex whether you can if you can handle the job then i think you should be able to do it
sw2193B-ms98-a-0030 160.333125 164.780250 but i do object to you know someone hiring a woman just because they have to meet their quota
sw2193B-ms98-a-0031 164.780250 166.152250 [silence]
sw2193B-ms98-a-0032 166.152250 166.815750 that's
sw2193B-ms98-a-0033 166.815750 169.961000 that's really just kind of discrimination no matter how any way you put it
sw2193B-ms98-a-0034 169.961000 175.965625 [silence]
sw2193B-ms98-a-0035 175.965625 182.615500 yeah i- i stutter to think that i may be flying in a seven forty seven with a woman who got on the flight program because she happened to have the right you know
sw2193B-ms98-a-0036 182.615500 184.924500 the right sex rather than qualifications
sw2193B-ms98-a-0037 184.924500 186.242125 [silence]
sw2193B-ms98-a-0038 186.242125 192.468000 yeah that's true i hate to [vocalized-noise] hate to look up and find someone who was admitted to medical school simply because she happened to be a female
sw2193B-ms98-a-0039 192.468000 193.641000 you know
sw2193B-ms98-a-0040 193.641000 195.715500 or a Black woman named Rodriguez
sw2193B-ms98-a-0041 195.715500 202.195250 [silence]
sw2193B-ms98-a-0042 202.195250 205.604875 well i think we are that society tends to overcompensate
sw2193B-ms98-a-0043 205.604875 206.833125 much with
sw2193B-ms98-a-0044 206.833125 211.098625 whatever it's with the Black the Black problem or whatever that may be now
sw2193B-ms98-a-0045 211.098625 220.990250 or with uh anyth[ing]- ethnic problems uh i think so[ciety]- society tends to overcompensate and we go we sw[ing]- we swing out to the far left and far right trying to get everybody in
sw2193B-ms98-a-0046 220.990250 222.430000 [silence]
sw2193B-ms98-a-0047 222.430000 223.850125 oh that's true oh yeah
sw2193B-ms98-a-0048 223.850125 226.956375 God forbid you should make some kind of sexist remark and say you know
sw2193B-ms98-a-0049 226.956375 228.224250 hey sweetie or something
sw2193B-ms98-a-0050 228.224250 243.474750 [silence]
sw2193B-ms98-a-0051 243.474750 246.062375 right a wait person
sw2193B-ms98-a-0052 246.062375 257.029375 [silence]
sw2193B-ms98-a-0053 257.029375 262.518750 what do you think about uh about our new governor since she happens to be a female
sw2193B-ms98-a-0054 262.518750 283.020125 [silence]
sw2193B-ms98-a-0055 283.020125 293.850250 i think i'm more scared of her not because she's a female but because more for her po[litical]- [vocalized-noise] her political beliefs and what she says she's going to do i think i'd be scared of anybody male or female in that position
sw2193B-ms98-a-0056 293.850250 295.806875 although you see more and more uh
sw2193B-ms98-a-0057 295.806875 298.903125 more and more of the ladies that are becoming active in politics
sw2193B-ms98-a-0058 298.903125 303.805000 and you know occupying a very prominent role with the politics and in the business sector
sw2193B-ms98-a-0059 303.805000 322.787875 [silence]
sw2193B-ms98-a-0060 322.787875 326.523000 i think her background totally bothers me
sw2193B-ms98-a-0061 326.523000 341.085375 [silence]
sw2193B-ms98-a-0062 341.085375 342.801500 that could be yeah
sw2193B-ms98-a-0063 342.801500 345.023500 [silence]
sw2193B-ms98-a-0064 345.023500 348.471000 yeah the governor was you know the governor he did this
sw2193B-ms98-a-0065 348.471000 351.021375 and now we got the governor she's going to do that
sw2193B-ms98-a-0066 351.021375 355.400750 wonder what they'll call if she was married and wonder if they'll refer to him as the first husband
sw2193B-ms98-a-0067 355.400750 364.441375 [silence]
sw2193B-ms98-a-0068 364.441375 366.771625 oh yeah Houston got a female mayor
sw2193B-ms98-a-0069 366.771625 367.789500 yeah
sw2193B-ms98-a-0070 367.789500 374.360750 she oh yeah she's a she's a staunch supporter of all the uh gay rights matter fact she lives down in the gay district
sw2193B-ms98-a-0071 374.360750 375.507000 oh yeah
sw2193B-ms98-a-0072 375.507000 376.460875 [silence]
sw2193B-ms98-a-0073 376.460875 386.136125 so i think you know i- i'm not sure whether she was elected because she was a female or be[cause]- or because she supported the gays i really don't know because a large you know there's a large population down there of gays
sw2193B-ms98-a-0074 386.136125 387.334500 yeah
sw2193B-ms98-a-0075 387.334500 388.670250 [silence]
sw2193B-ms98-a-0076 388.670250 394.170750 yeah she seems to be interesting i- i and you see more and more uh you know uh Mickey Leland's wife is
sw2193B-ms98-a-0077 394.170750 405.345500 taking over his seat and course you know we got the like you said they elected a female mayor in Dallas one in Houston we got a female governor and there's two or three more governors in in the in the state that are females
sw2193B-ms98-a-0078 405.345500 415.214375 and there's quite a few if they can do the job i think more power to them_1 you know i would i- i- i would dearly love to find out that you know i could i could say well i guess i was wrong about Ann Richards
sw2193B-ms98-a-0079 415.214375 431.195500 [silence]
sw2193B-ms98-a-0080 431.195500 435.186750 yeah but i think we're bred that way you know i think i think it's part of the
sw2193B-ms98-a-0081 435.186750 437.089625 of the of the male mystique
sw2193B-ms98-a-0082 437.089625 438.833375 [silence]
sw2193B-ms98-a-0083 438.833375 439.647750 and uh
sw2193B-ms98-a-0084 439.647750 441.400000 [silence]
sw2193B-ms98-a-0085 441.400000 450.982000 course the reason yeah i think it's going to be harder for for females in the next ten years or so to make strides in say you know the Southwest and Midwest and you down here
sw2193B-ms98-a-0086 450.982000 452.927625 in the southern states than it will be up
sw2193B-ms98-a-0087 452.927625 455.609125 in the more liberal east and west coast
sw2193B-ms98-a-0088 455.609125 456.727125 [silence]
sw2193B-ms98-a-0089 456.727125 458.290500 this is you know
sw2193B-ms98-a-0090 458.290500 462.013500 [silence]
sw2193B-ms98-a-0091 462.013500 467.650375 we don't have quite as many as they do east and west coast but this is kind of the last bastion of the you know the
sw2193B-ms98-a-0092 467.650375 473.100000 the good ole boys with the pickup and the rifle on the back and the quart of beer down your down between your legs driving down the road
sw2193B-ms98-a-0093 473.100000 480.152875 and of course that's changing too but you know i think and that came about because of the women you know Mothers Against Drunk Driving MADD
sw2193B-ms98-a-0094 480.152875 482.708250 [silence]
sw2193B-ms98-a-0095 482.708250 485.729750 the greatest force in America is mothers
sw2193B-ms98-a-0096 485.729750 486.920000 [silence]
sw2193B-ms98-a-0097 486.920000 489.927625 if you could mobilize the mothers you got them_1
sw2193B-ms98-a-0098 489.927625 491.583625 [silence]
sw2193B-ms98-a-0099 491.583625 492.775875 yeah
sw2193B-ms98-a-0100 492.775875 506.738375 [silence]
sw2193B-ms98-a-0101 506.738375 509.845625 just depends on who's going to exploit us when
sw2193B-ms98-a-0102 509.845625 520.422875 [silence]
sw2193B-ms98-a-0103 520.422875 525.273000 is that because they're just not uh you just don't have any women that are there or no one has
sw2193B-ms98-a-0104 525.273000 527.515125 ascended to that level yet
sw2193B-ms98-a-0105 527.515125 544.338250 [silence]
sw2193B-ms98-a-0106 544.338250 551.641625 i've noticed that in a lot of companies that you know everybody says well there's no women in upper management and my first question well is there anyone qualified to be there
sw2193B-ms98-a-0107 551.641625 558.934375 just because you happen to be a a female or a minority or anything else doesn't automatically mean y[ou]- it shouldn't mean that you get promoted to that part
sw2193B-ms98-a-0108 558.934375 565.651250 [silence]
sw2193B-ms98-a-0109 565.651250 566.477500 yeah
