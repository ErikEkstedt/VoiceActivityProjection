sw2185B-ms98-a-0011 46.498500 49.251875 yeah yeah that's for sure
sw2185B-ms98-a-0012 49.251875 61.282375 well we uh i just got married about six months ago and we bought a house at the same time so we're i'm sitting here in my forty year old house and we're about halfway through the painting [laughter-process] 
sw2185B-ms98-a-0013 61.282375 62.999125 so uh
sw2185B-ms98-a-0014 62.999125 73.363125 the only uh i guess the the big discussion just kind of what you were mentioning has been the color we ended up with our our living and dining room are now uh
sw2185B-ms98-a-0015 73.363125 83.267750 kind of a a light peach color with uh and it's got all the old original hardwood trim and stuff so we've got the trim in kind of uh kind of an off-white
sw2185B-ms98-a-0016 83.267750 91.952750 and this is really the first uh interior painting project that i've attacked [laughter] [laughter-and] [laughter-it's] it's been uh
sw2185B-ms98-a-0017 91.952750 98.737750 it's been something else [laughter] to say the least we we had the same type of situation uh the walls were uh
sw2185B-ms98-a-0018 98.737750 106.689625 uh well they weren't the color difference wasn't so bad but uh there was semigloss underneath
sw2185B-ms98-a-0019 106.689625 115.893875 and we put a flat over the top and everywhere you'd miss there'd be this little bright spot you could see [laughter] it seems like you could see it through about three layers of paint
sw2185B-ms98-a-0020 115.893875 125.007125 [laughter] [laughter-every] [laughter-time] [laughter-the] [laughter-sun] [laughter-would] [laughter-come] [laughter-up] in the morning i'd see another spot and have to drag out the paint can but uh we've learned we're we uh
sw2185B-ms98-a-0021 125.007125 132.977750 we worked we've worked our way back into the hallway and and we're in the middle of the bathroom now but uh it's it's been quite an adventure
sw2185B-ms98-a-0022 132.977750 140.175375 the other the other thing that makes it uh a little more difficult we've got all hardwood floors and uh
sw2185B-ms98-a-0023 140.175375 150.335250 we we've learned to be a little more careful about covering up the floors since the since the first [laughter-time] we [laughter-spent] a lot of time on the floor with a tooth toothbrush and what not cleaning up 
sw2185B-ms98-a-0024 150.335250 152.498125 [silence]
sw2185B-ms98-a-0025 152.498125 165.687875 well it's it's not too bad it it uh the floors are finished with a polyurethane and it's really not to bad to get off it it we're just using latex and it's not too bad to get it off once it's dried even it it it uh comes off with like a
sw2185B-ms98-a-0026 165.687875 174.014250 a mild abrasive pad like a Scotchbrite pad or something like that and wa[ter]- and soap and water so we got pretty lucky on [laughter-that] 
sw2185B-ms98-a-0027 174.014250 175.995625 no not really
sw2185B-ms98-a-0028 175.995625 177.770625 [silence]

sw2185B-ms98-a-0047 221.776875 223.400000 yeah i
sw2185B-ms98-a-0048 223.400000 230.203500 we uh our house was painted as part of the purchase contract so we didn't have to mess with that this time but i've
sw2185B-ms98-a-0049 230.203500 242.275375 i i grew up on a farm so i i've i've messed with outdoor painting a little bit uh but most of that it was done with a sprayer and uh up in the bucket of a loader tractor or something like that so it
sw2185B-ms98-a-0050 242.275375 250.989500 took a lot of the hassle out and then they're we're not you know you're not nearly as concerned with a barn or a granary or something like that as you would be with your own house
sw2185B-ms98-a-0051 250.989500 253.006625 [laughter]
sw2185B-ms98-a-0052 253.006625 254.498875 [silence]
sw2185B-ms98-a-0053 254.498875 257.169500 uh a little bit yeah yeah
sw2185B-ms98-a-0054 257.169500 258.299500 [silence]
sw2185B-ms98-a-0055 258.299500 259.143500 yeah

sw2185B-ms98-a-0057 260.499000 261.996125 [silence]
sw2185B-ms98-a-0058 261.996125 263.491250 yeah
sw2185B-ms98-a-0059 263.491250 269.273000 oh gosh yeah just just the opposite of what everybody's uh working towards now
sw2185B-ms98-a-0060 269.273000 275.494125 [silence]
sw2185B-ms98-a-0061 275.494125 285.445000 yeah yeah absolutely [laughter] yeah we uh we stocked up the first time around but we've definitely got all the formulas on file and uh
sw2185B-ms98-a-0062 285.445000 293.952625 we're they'll be there for a while we're we're pretty comfortable with that but yeah it it i'm i'm real nervous every time i i open a new can i'm wondering if i shouldn't
sw2185B-ms98-a-0063 293.952625 302.393875 buy about twenty gallons at one time and keep it all in a in a wash tub or something somewhere because i'm alway[s]- i'm always afraid that the next coat is not going to match
sw2185B-ms98-a-0064 302.393875 310.477000 but uh it's gone pretty well it just it it takes it takes some time my problem is while
sw2185B-ms98-a-0065 310.477000 317.997375 i'm not overly proud of it but i'm a self-proclaimed proclaimed perfectionist and it it takes me a long time to do trim and things like that
sw2185B-ms98-a-0066 317.997375 329.258625 and i'll find i'll find something as i'm going along something not related like like uh i've gone about changing out all the outlets and switches because they they really didn't match
sw2185B-ms98-a-0067 329.258625 341.000375 they were a few of them were broken and things like that so i always pick up these little extra tasks as i'm doing this and [laughter-and] the painting actually takes probably uh a fourth of the time
sw2185B-ms98-a-0068 341.000375 350.939375 and i i'm always doing all this other stuff and my wife's hollering at me and wondering what else i've come home with from work this time to to put in a ceiling fan or something strange like that
sw2185B-ms98-a-0069 350.939375 363.458875 so uh it it it it always it it it gets you to look at everything real hard when you you start putting a coat of paint on everything you start to notice where all the dents and scratches and things are everywhere 
sw2185B-ms98-a-0070 363.458875 367.766375 [silence]
sw2185B-ms98-a-0071 367.766375 369.278250 yeah
sw2185B-ms98-a-0072 369.278250 371.763500 yeah it sure makes a difference
sw2185B-ms98-a-0073 371.763500 374.473125 [silence]
sw2185B-ms98-a-0074 374.473125 375.791000 [laughter]

sw2185B-ms98-a-0077 378.994000 381.185625 [silence]
sw2185B-ms98-a-0078 381.185625 395.499875 yeah it's it's been uh we we bought this house with the idea that we were going to spend you know spend a lot of time working on it and uh it was part you know part of the excitement was was getting a good deal on an older house it just
sw2185B-ms98-a-0079 395.499875 406.994125 it really hadn't been taken care of very well it it was actually it was rented out for a couple of years and things like that so we uh we ended up getting a fairly good deal on it but uh there just isn't enough time i i've
sw2185B-ms98-a-0080 406.994125 416.482000 i find myself going to work knowing that that there's a job about half done at home and i really if i would if i'd just stay home and finish it i'd feel a lot better but uh
sw2185B-ms98-a-0081 416.482000 425.480875 i'm i'm starting to learn that there's always something else so that you could [laughter] once you get done you can always start over and and you can make up all kinds of excuses so uh 
sw2185B-ms98-a-0082 425.480875 426.982000 [silence]
sw2185B-ms98-a-0083 426.982000 433.023375 uh not a whole lot it they're they're in pretty good condition um
sw2185B-ms98-a-0084 433.023375 444.315000 as as far as uh major repairs you know lo[t]- a lot of little filling holes and nicks and things like that but uh the only the most major things have been uh oh
sw2185B-ms98-a-0085 444.315000 458.337000 i guess i- i moved a couple of outlets and or uh switches i should say they um for some reason they put a bathroom light switch in the hallway and uh yeah and i i didn't like that very well so i i moved that but uh 
sw2185B-ms98-a-0086 458.337000 461.272000 most of it most of it's in pretty good shape
sw2185B-ms98-a-0087 461.272000 462.307875 [silence]
sw2185B-ms98-a-0088 462.307875 464.488250 uh live in Dallas
sw2185B-ms98-a-0089 464.488250 466.682500 okay okay

sw2185B-ms98-a-0093 471.997000 481.486750 no no i haven't uh i hadn't tried in fact we were we were planting flowers [laughter-this] [laughter-weekend] so uh i was pretty tied up
sw2185B-ms98-a-0094 481.486750 482.499000 but
sw2185B-ms98-a-0095 482.499000 489.722250 [silence]

sw2185B-ms98-a-0098 496.720750 499.481375 no that uh that's
sw2185B-ms98-a-0099 499.481375 511.169125 yeah you know it [laughter-i] [laughter-get] a so[re]- i get a sore neck from looking up all the time yeah things [laughter-like] [laughter-that] but uh no that pretty much covers my experiences
sw2185B-ms98-a-0100 511.169125 521.963500 oh yeah most definitely it it just it makes such a difference like i like i say th[e]- the overall appearance of this house is what really devalued it so much uh
sw2185B-ms98-a-0101 521.963500 534.486125 i you know i i don't want to put a price on it but i just feel like we're every every gallon of paint adds a tremendous amount of value to the house you know ev[ery]- every time i do something a aside from that it just makes me feel a whole lot better to come home and 
sw2185B-ms98-a-0102 534.486125 539.700250 you know o[ld]- [laughter] the walls are clean and they match and all those kinds of things 
sw2185B-ms98-a-0103 539.700250 543.481375 [silence]
sw2185B-ms98-a-0104 543.481375 547.237125 yeah yeah we do it uh
sw2185B-ms98-a-0105 547.237125 550.453625 it sometimes works and it sometimes doesn't it's
sw2185B-ms98-a-0106 550.453625 564.496875 i uh when i start doing trim i i've gotten to where i i tend to freehand it because there there's so many layers of paint on this house after forty years that uh it it's so hard to tell where an edge is anymore and uh
sw2185B-ms98-a-0107 564.496875 567.483000 yeah yeah they [vocalized-noise]
sw2185B-ms98-a-0108 567.483000 570.729375 no there's no carpet in the house right now

sw2185B-ms98-a-0113 586.497375 595.717375 yeah i i've [vocalized-noise] i've seen uh they're they make some plastic edging stuff that comes in like three foot lengths
sw2185B-ms98-a-0114 595.717375 600.579125 and you can uh you can tape them together and and and put
