sw2185A-ms98-a-0002 0.834875 6.500000 well [noise] i was just looking around my house and thinking about the painting that i've done
sw2185A-ms98-a-0003 6.500000 10.569750 and the last time that um we tackled it i did the kitchen
sw2185A-ms98-a-0004 10.569750 19.997625 and i had gone through a period of depression at one time and painted everything a dark it was called a sassafras it was kind of an orangish brown
sw2185A-ms98-a-0005 19.997625 25.501875 it was not real pretty anyway so the kitchen was one of the rooms that got hit with that color
sw2185A-ms98-a-0006 25.501875 32.126875 [laughter] i tried to cover it with white and it was quite a a feat getting that dark color
sw2185A-ms98-a-0007 32.126875 43.739750 covered and then just the hassles getting around the cabinets and know if i look underneath my cabinets i'm not satisfied with the jobs i i did on it because there're splotches
sw2185A-ms98-a-0008 43.739750 47.158875 but i'm glad it's done because it's brighter

sw2185A-ms98-a-0065 488.311750 497.760875 surface like the house like to paint a picture or anything i don't know i can't think of anything else to say about painting
sw2185A-ms98-a-0066 497.760875 500.730500 it hurts your back and it hurts your arm
