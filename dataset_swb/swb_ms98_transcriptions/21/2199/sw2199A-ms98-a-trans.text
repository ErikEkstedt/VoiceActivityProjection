sw2199A-ms98-a-0015 43.707125 50.928250 Laura talks about growing uh right right now she's interested i think in a herb garden she mentioned this morning that she could grow just you know flower box 
sw2199A-ms98-a-0016 50.928250 54.554125 and i think that's but i think uh a[fter]- after we um
sw2199A-ms98-a-0017 54.554125 64.189875 after i finish school and we're ready to you know settle down someplace and i get a decent job then we'll look for something probably with a nice size yard that we can have a garden

sw2199A-ms98-a-0019 68.053125 69.451750 yeah
sw2199A-ms98-a-0020 69.451750 78.050625 yeah th[at]- yeah th[at]- and that's the big problem with being in an apartment is we've talked about it and even uh Laura even said you know as a wedding present we should ask for these big pots
sw2199A-ms98-a-0021 78.050625 89.825125 you know that we could put on the front porch and because_1 the apartment complex actually we have the whole front porch and somebody else lives on the other side so we thought about you know having putting it in pots and putting the pots just on our steps
sw2199A-ms98-a-0022 89.825125 98.038500 and growing maybe tomatoes or flowers like right now it would be beautiful in in Maryland you know daffodils are just all blooming so it would be really pretty

sw2199A-ms98-a-0051 196.239375 202.557500 right yeah that jeez i never thought of that because see here our growing season is basically done
sw2199A-ms98-a-0052 202.557500 210.058875 by um well you might have some tomatoes still blooming in uh in October the begi[ning]- very be[gining]- first week of October
sw2199A-ms98-a-0053 210.058875 215.535250 but normally everything's done by September end of September means you're basically done growing anything
sw2199A-ms98-a-0054 215.535250 217.198500 [silence]
sw2199A-ms98-a-0055 217.198500 219.207000 um-hum yeah because_1 it

sw2199A-ms98-a-0059 231.580375 234.910000 um-hum we don't even grow okra up here

sw2199A-ms98-a-0061 235.913250 238.361375 yeah we don't have the right whatever yeah
sw2199A-ms98-a-0062 238.361375 240.096625 [silence]
sw2199A-ms98-a-0063 240.096625 245.517750 well i think it it it it's getting um a little bit more popular because see there's a lot of the um
sw2199A-ms98-a-0064 245.517750 253.571000 first you know first the big wave of Tex-Mex food came by you know and so we're we're big into tacos and stuff up here now and and taco salads and things
sw2199A-ms98-a-0065 253.571000 262.222375 which they probably Mexican people don't even know what a taco salad is but i think it's now it's moving up too because uh just a change you know just something different
sw2199A-ms98-a-0066 262.222375 269.710125 plus it's a little bit more vegetable oriented and i think the uh the mid Atlantic states have been a long time holdout for beef and potatoes
sw2199A-ms98-a-0067 269.710125 271.967125 i think it's our Irish descent
sw2199A-ms98-a-0068 271.967125 278.707250 yeah but i think it it's changing now yeah so i so we do know what okra is i wouldn't have known what it was when i was a teenager though
sw2199A-ms98-a-0069 278.707250 282.759000 [silence]
sw2199A-ms98-a-0070 282.759000 288.697875 well we were going to probably just going to start well because we're going to be moving we're talking about just putting throwing tomatoes in
sw2199A-ms98-a-0071 288.697875 296.366625 you know and then uh but also things like tulips i think uh i would have liked to had flowers like daffodils blooming right now you know
sw2199A-ms98-a-0072 296.366625 298.005875 [silence]

sw2199A-ms98-a-0075 301.775625 306.246250 yeah we we talked about that too in fact um our sister-in-law Laura's
sw2199A-ms98-a-0076 306.246250 313.073875 brother's wife you know was talking about you know putting strawberries uh moving their strawberries because_1 they just moved
sw2199A-ms98-a-0077 313.073875 320.117500 i it's this problem with being in school you know they just moved and they took their strawberries that they had out in their yard and put them all in containers
sw2199A-ms98-a-0078 320.117500 325.314000 and they're going to decide what they're going to do with them i think but they're going to let them bloom this year in the containers
sw2199A-ms98-a-0079 325.314000 326.617125 um-hum

sw2199A-ms98-a-0108 409.290875 416.326000 i can remember as a kid growing up my whole family all my family grew strawberries grew excuse me grew tomatoes
sw2199A-ms98-a-0109 416.326000 420.610125 so whenever somebody would come over your house they'd always bring some tomatoes well but you grew your own tomatoes
sw2199A-ms98-a-0110 420.610125 426.821000 so if somebody brings you half a dozen tomatoes it doesn't do you any good because you already had a half a dozen you know pulled that day 
sw2199A-ms98-a-0111 426.821000 428.267500 it's really funny

sw2199A-ms98-a-0128 470.622500 473.341125 yeah i guess the more you plant the less you have to mow
sw2199A-ms98-a-0129 473.341125 477.461625 because_1 that's a when i had my yard it was you know it was it was really a hassle
sw2199A-ms98-a-0130 477.461625 482.854875 uh cutting grass was just a terr[ible]- just the thought of it was a terrible thing oh i used to hate it

sw2199A-ms98-a-0134 491.072125 494.157875 yep because it's when it's self propelled it's heavy yeah
sw2199A-ms98-a-0135 494.157875 505.256125 [silence]
sw2199A-ms98-a-0136 505.256125 507.335125 [laughter] yeah that

sw2199A-ms98-a-0138 508.760000 510.219000 [laughter]
sw2199A-ms98-a-0139 510.219000 516.916750 my uh my brother went out and bought a mower used you know he was looking for a lawn mower and he he just had bought a house he lived in an apartment before
sw2199A-ms98-a-0140 516.916750 524.248250 and he bought a used mower it was a real big heavy one and he said that that you know basically th[ey]- they sold it on him because you know it was a macho thing
sw2199A-ms98-a-0141 524.248250 527.697000 the bigger and heavier the lawn mower the more macho the guy behind it
sw2199A-ms98-a-0142 527.697000 535.582125 so you know of course he w[ouldn't]- couldn't buy one of those little little tiny skinny ones that you can get at one of the uh one of the Aames or
sw2199A-ms98-a-0143 535.582125 545.140375 the the fast mowing places you had to buy a big one you know because_1 it meant something for your macho same reason why you have to drive a big truck with four wheels you know with four wheel drive
sw2199A-ms98-a-0144 545.140375 553.640000 it was a macho thing he had to use that but then after he used it one year he took it back to where he got it used and he sold it back to them_1 and traded it in for another one that was smaller
sw2199A-ms98-a-0145 553.640000 556.384875 because_1 he said it was just too dang heavy
sw2199A-ms98-a-0146 556.384875 560.789375 [laughter] yeah plus i think he lives at a small hillside too so
sw2199A-ms98-a-0147 560.789375 566.472125 yeah c[ut]- trying to cut it sideways on an angle and turning around you know without it tipping over was a pain
sw2199A-ms98-a-0148 566.472125 572.138000 [silence]
sw2199A-ms98-a-0149 572.138000 573.455875 yeah

sw2199A-ms98-a-0152 579.598000 586.864625 [silence]
sw2199A-ms98-a-0153 586.864625 592.910500 uh-huh well it's probably his his his personal time while he's cutting the grass he's probably thinking about something else
sw2199A-ms98-a-0154 592.910500 599.858250 it's probably and plus no one bothers him you know you walk behind a lawn mower making all that noise no one ever talks to you you know you're on your own
