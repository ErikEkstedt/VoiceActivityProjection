sw2199B-ms98-a-0023 101.370250 105.609750 you just need to get the you need to get the right mix of soil so that it doesn't dry out
sw2199B-ms98-a-0024 105.609750 109.567500 and so that your plants because and then you have to you still have to water them a lot of times
sw2199B-ms98-a-0025 109.567500 114.972125 once a here in Dallas you have to water sometimes twice a day because it gets so hot in the summer

sw2199B-ms98-a-0033 144.377625 148.486375 and so we're all everybody's out planting and buying and

sw2199B-ms98-a-0038 157.862500 162.217125 yeah it makes it nice for gardening when it's when it's like that because we can grow a lot of things
sw2199B-ms98-a-0039 162.217125 171.002625 even through the winter that uh y'all can't grow we can start i can start a garden in July i've done that and and plant some of the uh
sw2199B-ms98-a-0040 171.002625 179.211125 sturdier crops broccoli and things like that you have to really water it a lot when it's when it's young like that and it's in the heat but then
sw2199B-ms98-a-0041 179.211125 183.312375 then as the fall comes on you get a you can get a really beautiful second crop
sw2199B-ms98-a-0042 183.312375 191.133375 of a lot of the cooler weather vegetables and sometimes that's the only some peas and different things like that that's the only time of the year you can grow them_1
sw2199B-ms98-a-0043 191.133375 197.408000 because otherwise it's too it gets if you start them when it's cooler in the spring then it gets too hot in the summer

sw2199B-ms98-a-0068 298.587500 302.529625 if you were going to do that you might put some strawberries in there around the edges

sw2199B-ms98-a-0072 324.482500 328.951250 yeah they'll work that way and th[ey're]- they're kind of pretty they've got little white flowers and
sw2199B-ms98-a-0073 328.951250 330.277125 long as you
sw2199B-ms98-a-0074 330.277125 331.385125 [silence]
sw2199B-ms98-a-0075 331.385125 332.463875 no
sw2199B-ms98-a-0076 332.463875 337.948750 they'd grow kind of like a vine they they put out little feelers kind of like an ivy would
sw2199B-ms98-a-0077 337.948750 346.098875 and and along those is wh[ere]- that's where the strawberry grows and it will eventually take over an area you plant them_1 when you plant strawberries you plant them_1 like
sw2199B-ms98-a-0078 346.098875 353.269625 six to eight inches or more you can even plant further than that but to cover an area so you co[ver]- you put them eight inches apart all through a flower bed
sw2199B-ms98-a-0079 353.269625 358.124875 and by the next year you'll have pretty much a solid bed of strawberries
sw2199B-ms98-a-0080 358.124875 360.094375 [silence]
sw2199B-ms98-a-0081 360.094375 364.912000 they're real simple that's why [laughter-i] [laughter-like] [laughter-them] i just put a bunch out because_1 you just put them_1 out there and you water them_1
sw2199B-ms98-a-0082 364.912000 369.070750 the bugs don't least h[ere]- at least here the bugs don't particularly bother them
sw2199B-ms98-a-0083 369.070750 373.212000 and they don't require a lot of fertilizing or care you know during the rest of the year
sw2199B-ms98-a-0084 373.212000 374.248000 [silence]
sw2199B-ms98-a-0085 374.248000 380.749000 yeah and then about every five years you have to dig them_1 up and throw them_1 away and start over again they don't last forever
sw2199B-ms98-a-0086 380.749000 382.969875 [silence]
sw2199B-ms98-a-0087 382.969875 387.752750 it that can help but you just get to a point where they're just not productive anymore 
sw2199B-ms98-a-0088 387.752750 391.354750 it's just a kind of uh just the way the plant is
sw2199B-ms98-a-0089 391.354750 392.512500 yeah
sw2199B-ms98-a-0090 392.512500 397.303250 [silence]
sw2199B-ms98-a-0091 397.303250 403.104375 yeah i like tomatoes but i always end up with when i've grown them_1 i- i end up with the little cherry tomatoes
sw2199B-ms98-a-0092 403.104375 406.993000 just thousands of them_1 [laughter-and] [laughter-i] [laughter-can't] [laughter-figure] [laughter-out] [laughter-what] [laughter-to] [laughter-do] [laughter-with] [laughter-them_1] [laughter-all]
sw2199B-ms98-a-0093 406.993000 409.766750 [vocalized-noise] yeah because_1 everybody else is growing

sw2199B-ms98-a-0102 436.619250 443.040500 they do real good especially impatiens because_1 you tend to get shade when you're on a porch area part of the time
