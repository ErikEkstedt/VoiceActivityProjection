sw2155B-ms98-a-0005 4.473500 9.726750 um i like the idea of nursing homes as a as a growing
sw2155B-ms98-a-0006 9.726750 24.195500 choi[ce]- the choices you have in nursing homes now whereas used to you used to have only you put you know when when people got to the point where they were debilitated and couldn't take care of themselves and there was no other choice you couldn't take them in your own home then they went into a nursing home you know maybe you lived
sw2155B-ms98-a-0007 24.195500 28.446750 too far away to care for them or your daily job or whatever prevented it
sw2155B-ms98-a-0008 28.446750 38.220625 but um i like the choices you have now where they can go into an apartment type setting and have some basically have a independent lifestyle but assisted care
sw2155B-ms98-a-0009 38.220625 43.724250 and then if things deteriorate they can go to a second level which is
sw2155B-ms98-a-0010 43.724250 57.681625 you know like where they prepare their meals for them and and they still live somewhat independently but they have people checking on them and making sure they have hot meals and then where the same community a lot of times will also have the third level which is full care
sw2155B-ms98-a-0011 57.681625 69.253125 you know where some people can't where they're in a wheelchair or where they're in a bed and they can't get around but then they have full care but i really like those those options now and and i think about it more often because my husband's parents
sw2155B-ms98-a-0012 69.253125 74.672125 are they're very active right now but they're seventy five and and seventy two
sw2155B-ms98-a-0013 74.672125 80.981250 so that comes up somewhat more often in my thoughts as i see these things because of their age
sw2155B-ms98-a-0014 80.981250 92.452375 [silence]
sw2155B-ms98-a-0015 92.452375 93.752000 uh-huh

sw2155B-ms98-a-0025 147.308500 148.497500 right
sw2155B-ms98-a-0026 148.497500 151.477000 [silence]
sw2155B-ms98-a-0027 151.477000 164.745375 yeah that's some of the things i would find important before i i would look into that for a person is is is like you're saying a good mix of people who have the same interests and uh and the programs here they have different
sw2155B-ms98-a-0028 164.745375 172.254500 uh besides just different levels within the same program they have different types of programs they have several areas they have one area in town where the people
sw2155B-ms98-a-0029 172.254500 182.763375 i guess a lot of it comes with money it this this one area is a bit more expensive and the people who probably are living there have had more money in their life but but things that people where they have similar interests
sw2155B-ms98-a-0030 182.763375 194.987375 like you're saying and the programs that they have where where some of them will have dances once a week and some of them sponsor different crafts and they go to the arboretum to see things and they make sure that if they want to go to church there's a bus there
sw2155B-ms98-a-0031 194.987375 199.956125 and it'll or you know or someone will transport them to a specific church even though it's
sw2155B-ms98-a-0032 199.956125 213.978875 you know maybe it's thirty minutes away because it's a big you know Dallas area is a big metropolitan area but a lot of these places have have churches or have have individual transportation that's that's something i'd look for something that would make me happy
sw2155B-ms98-a-0033 213.978875 226.793875 personally if i had to live there because i don't think a lot of people really even in the nice ones and even in the ones where they can live fairly independently they really don't necessarily like it because they're not in their own home
sw2155B-ms98-a-0034 226.793875 232.741500 so i think those kinds of things to make it more home like and to make it more um
sw2155B-ms98-a-0035 232.741500 243.728125 enjoyable for them that'd that'd be one thing i'd look for along with the uh health care aspects to make sure they had you know that it was clean and that they had good doctors and nurses
sw2155B-ms98-a-0036 243.728125 255.000000 [silence]
sw2155B-ms98-a-0037 255.000000 255.998750 uh-huh

sw2155B-ms98-a-0041 273.993125 275.492250 yeah
sw2155B-ms98-a-0042 275.492250 278.246250 are overmedicated too
sw2155B-ms98-a-0043 278.246250 287.989000 [silence]
sw2155B-ms98-a-0044 287.989000 295.463750 uh-huh yeah that's one of the things that that we don't think about as we get older and the the money that it now requires
sw2155B-ms98-a-0045 295.463750 308.467750 to uh be in one of these places because some of these people that are just on social security and if they don't have any living relatives perhaps they never had children or if their children you know passed away before they did they can be in some places that are
sw2155B-ms98-a-0046 308.467750 316.747250 you know that that are not good where they they have very minimum minimal care and the the care that they are getting the people who are giving it
sw2155B-ms98-a-0047 316.747250 326.713875 are pro[bably]- are paid at a minimum wage and they just do they don't care as much and and like you said they're trying to make it the caretakers in some cases are trying to make easy on themselves
sw2155B-ms98-a-0048 326.713875 341.490625 to the point where they're putting people in bed or overmedicating them so they'll stay in one spot and not do anything that certainly would be something to to watch for because you've got with some of them being some of these places can even be two and three thousand dollars a month to stay in fee
sw2155B-ms98-a-0049 341.490625 342.698000 [silence]

sw2155B-ms98-a-0054 350.487750 353.999875 yeah you've got to really strike a balance in what kind of care
sw2155B-ms98-a-0055 353.999875 360.236750 what kind of level of care you need and then what you can unfortunately what you can afford at the same time

sw2155B-ms98-a-0059 378.723375 388.477250 well like there are other communities too that aren't necessarily a nursing home i had an aunt who lived in a small town in Texas that um was in a
sw2155B-ms98-a-0060 388.477250 395.203875 it was a it was a housing division each person had their own little bitty house that they had built and it was um
sw2155B-ms98-a-0061 395.203875 404.176125 supplemented their they were most of them were on social security and they got some kind of supplemental aid besides from the state government but it was this little bitty one bedroom house
sw2155B-ms98-a-0062 404.176125 409.494375 but it was a separate house and they had a living room and a bedroom and a kitchen and a bathroom
sw2155B-ms98-a-0063 409.494375 422.478000 so they still had they had and they had people who came in who um supervised th[em]- all these houses were like fifteen or twenty of them all right together kind of like on one block and they had a a supervisory um
sw2155B-ms98-a-0064 422.478000 426.030875 wasn't a house really it was it was more like a
sw2155B-ms98-a-0065 426.030875 434.473625 a headquarters or something anyway where they they staffed it three shifts a day so that someone if they needed someone they could ring and and someone could come to their house
sw2155B-ms98-a-0066 434.473625 442.249250 and that and they always cooked then they had they had the choice you know they lived in their own little house they had their own possessions still in there to some ex[tent]- you know some of them
sw2155B-ms98-a-0067 442.249250 448.216750 and they could make their own breakfast if they wanted to and their own dinner and they always had somebody come in for lunch
sw2155B-ms98-a-0068 448.216750 460.993625 but they had people who did you know they didn't have to mess with the yard they had people who did the yard and they had a maid that uh uh service that came in and cleaned everybody's house so they didn't have to worry about that and it was really a nice
sw2155B-ms98-a-0069 460.993625 473.176625 it was really a nice compromise especially because she felt like she was still living in her own house and she still had her own couch and her own bed and it it really helped a lot and she was a lot more comfortable and she didn't
sw2155B-ms98-a-0070 473.176625 479.696125 [noise]
sw2155B-ms98-a-0071 479.696125 480.730500 yeah

sw2155B-ms98-a-0077 493.993500 503.283000 yeah it would be hard to that's that's why this she was she felt that way too but when it helped that she got to still be in a house and still have some of her own stuff
sw2155B-ms98-a-0078 503.283000 508.975250 and i guess that that it was a pilot program i think where she lived so it's probably not widely available

sw2155B-ms98-a-0088 545.996250 547.734500 well that's good
sw2155B-ms98-a-0089 547.734500 551.287875 everybody needs some sense of responsibility
sw2155B-ms98-a-0090 551.287875 554.497625 an even even if it's just a little bit yeah
sw2155B-ms98-a-0091 554.497625 565.998000 so it's it's more like living with a big in a big house where it's your turn to to set the table like you're saying or whatever instead of being waited on hand and foot all the time yeah that would be nice
