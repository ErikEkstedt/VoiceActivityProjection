sw2155A-ms98-a-0019 80.711375 92.718500 yes um it's it's funny because um i know people at that are in all three and people that work you know i know someone that w[orks]- works in all three different stages like you said
sw2155A-ms98-a-0020 92.718500 102.241875 and i have known you know people close to me that have been in all three and i have seen them like go from where they're in an apartment building they we call it um
sw2155A-ms98-a-0021 102.241875 110.985250 well we have high rises and it's just for elderly people you know or most of most of one of their spouses has already passed away
sw2155A-ms98-a-0022 110.985250 118.741750 and it's really nice for them because then they're with people their own age and people that have gone through things exactly what they have gone through
sw2155A-ms98-a-0023 118.741750 125.969125 and it's it's really nice to go and see them you know where they can still get around and everything and they still you know do their own thing
sw2155A-ms98-a-0024 125.969125 136.705875 but it's it's really nice to see them because i mean sometimes like i had a great aunt she lived with us for um three months and because she's starting to get Alzheimer's disease
sw2155A-ms98-a-0025 136.705875 147.991500 and i know i have a bunch of younger brothers and sisters and i know it was hard for me as well as it was for them to to actually sit down because she doesn't like doing things that the younger kids like doing
sw2155A-ms98-a-0026 147.991500 152.004625 and to actually sit so it's really nice to see that

sw2155A-ms98-a-0046 255.358500 267.298125 and i was so surprised to hear how many people like whenever they're in you know the older people they're like um fastened to their beds so they can't get out just because they you know they wander the halls
sw2155A-ms98-a-0047 267.298125 276.677625 and they get the wrong medicine just because you know the the aides or whoever just give them the wrong medicine and so many of them you know are
sw2155A-ms98-a-0048 276.677625 289.469875 yes and it was it was awful to hear what you know what some of these people really went through And i forget the percentage of people that you know that she had said and this was i mean she did research on it and everything

sw2155A-ms98-a-0093 521.273125 526.201375 and they're allow you know th[ey]- none of them have cars because they can't drive
sw2155A-ms98-a-0094 526.201375 537.242000 but if someone would come to get them you know they're allowed to leave with them and there's a staff there that makes supper for them and each person has a chore like maybe Wednesday night it's George's turn to set all the tables
sw2155A-ms98-a-0095 537.242000 548.479750 and it's really nice because that keeps them going too rather than just sitting around and i know um our youth group goes over and we play bingo with them and you know like stuff like that
