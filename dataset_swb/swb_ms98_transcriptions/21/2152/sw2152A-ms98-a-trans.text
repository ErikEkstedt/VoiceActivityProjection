sw2152A-ms98-a-0010 20.789125 25.615625 no but uh i know when my children were growing up we did spend a lot of time together

sw2152A-ms98-a-0012 29.264250 37.319625 and of course the girls uh and and uh myself we rooted you know we didn't participate but we did a lot of family things together 
sw2152A-ms98-a-0013 37.319625 44.537625 we had animals for the children you know our horses and that kind of thing and uh school activities type stuff
sw2152A-ms98-a-0014 44.537625 46.681625 [silence]
sw2152A-ms98-a-0015 46.681625 47.786000 uh-huh
sw2152A-ms98-a-0016 47.786000 49.209375 [silence]
sw2152A-ms98-a-0017 49.209375 50.872500 uh-huh
sw2152A-ms98-a-0018 50.872500 53.869875 did you find the time to attend
sw2152A-ms98-a-0019 53.869875 55.608250 oh yeah we did too
sw2152A-ms98-a-0020 55.608250 59.710875 [silence]
sw2152A-ms98-a-0021 59.710875 63.012125 i think that's kind of the key don't you
sw2152A-ms98-a-0022 63.012125 65.144500 i think that's kind of the key
sw2152A-ms98-a-0023 65.144500 67.340875 is to not be in the big city
sw2152A-ms98-a-0024 67.340875 70.018000 [silence]
sw2152A-ms98-a-0025 70.018000 71.149625 right
sw2152A-ms98-a-0026 71.149625 72.281250 and
sw2152A-ms98-a-0027 72.281250 78.337750 [silence]
sw2152A-ms98-a-0028 78.337750 87.438250 yep we did that too and the children where um when in fact when my youngest was about two we decided to get out of the city and go to the country
sw2152A-ms98-a-0029 87.438250 93.380750 i mean it's not as vast a country as like you know where you people are from because i lived in Abilene for a little while
sw2152A-ms98-a-0030 93.380750 97.246250 and uh i know what nothing is when i moved out there
sw2152A-ms98-a-0031 97.246250 105.385625 you know it the city itself is great but i mean you go in the in the uh car for a drive and you could see nothing for miles and miles and miles
sw2152A-ms98-a-0032 105.385625 107.535250 [silence]
sw2152A-ms98-a-0033 107.535250 108.852250 uh-huh
sw2152A-ms98-a-0034 108.852250 118.074875 [silence]
sw2152A-ms98-a-0035 118.074875 119.562250 yeah
sw2152A-ms98-a-0036 119.562250 121.081625 uh-huh
sw2152A-ms98-a-0037 121.081625 123.819875 but they at least they had the background
sw2152A-ms98-a-0038 123.819875 133.310750 and the the home uh the family type unit you know and i think when kids have that they don't [noise] get into as much trouble or seek to
sw2152A-ms98-a-0039 133.310750 137.760250 you know do other things that are really not good for them you know
sw2152A-ms98-a-0040 137.760250 142.624750 [silence]
sw2152A-ms98-a-0041 142.624750 144.474250 yep same here
sw2152A-ms98-a-0042 144.474250 148.869250 [silence]
sw2152A-ms98-a-0043 148.869250 149.946500 no
sw2152A-ms98-a-0044 149.946500 150.996000 [silence]
sw2152A-ms98-a-0045 150.996000 158.066500 no i know i'm so happy that i had mine had mine when i did and that i'm not having them now i think about it
sw2152A-ms98-a-0046 158.066500 159.688500 [silence]
sw2152A-ms98-a-0047 159.688500 162.119375 no no
sw2152A-ms98-a-0048 162.119375 167.052625 and plus i think that the uh mo[thers]- the husbands and wives both having to work
sw2152A-ms98-a-0049 167.052625 170.590125 it's not a matter of choice anymore i think most people
sw2152A-ms98-a-0050 170.590125 171.585625 yeah
sw2152A-ms98-a-0051 171.585625 175.719000 and uh it that takes so much time away from your kids
sw2152A-ms98-a-0052 175.719000 181.061750 of course at the at the time i worked third shift to be with my kids during the day
sw2152A-ms98-a-0053 181.061750 184.919875 you know and then uh my uh husband was with them at night
sw2152A-ms98-a-0054 184.919875 188.307250 so they were always with a family member you know
sw2152A-ms98-a-0055 188.307250 194.403000 and babysitters and uh day care and all that stuff kids don't really bond anymore
sw2152A-ms98-a-0056 194.403000 196.364875 the mother's aren't there
sw2152A-ms98-a-0057 196.364875 206.642875 [silence]
sw2152A-ms98-a-0058 206.642875 208.144000 oh yeah
sw2152A-ms98-a-0059 208.144000 209.433125 yep
sw2152A-ms98-a-0060 209.433125 215.537000 [silence]
sw2152A-ms98-a-0061 215.537000 217.205750 exactly
sw2152A-ms98-a-0062 217.205750 226.137875 but you know uh i wonder by the time they get through paying out for all the day care center and everything else is it really worth all that
sw2152A-ms98-a-0063 226.137875 229.904125 rather than to wait until the children are like in school
sw2152A-ms98-a-0064 229.904125 234.884375 and then go for that type of goal i think that too many people want everything now
sw2152A-ms98-a-0065 234.884375 237.905500 like we had to save and plan and
sw2152A-ms98-a-0066 237.905500 241.773125 do without and that kind of stuff where it's now the credit cards and
sw2152A-ms98-a-0067 241.773125 244.872875 i mean they just go and buy it you know
sw2152A-ms98-a-0068 244.872875 247.792500 [silence]
sw2152A-ms98-a-0069 247.792500 249.120375 exac[t]-
sw2152A-ms98-a-0070 249.120375 250.495125 yep
sw2152A-ms98-a-0071 250.495125 254.000375 [silence]
sw2152A-ms98-a-0072 254.000375 255.964250 exactly
sw2152A-ms98-a-0073 255.964250 257.296000 sure
sw2152A-ms98-a-0074 257.296000 260.766750 [silence]
sw2152A-ms98-a-0075 260.766750 266.317875 that's my point and and i think that they should like learn how to crawl before they walk
sw2152A-ms98-a-0076 266.317875 269.751500 it's it's too much it and it's too accessible
sw2152A-ms98-a-0077 269.751500 274.472375 and they get into it and they're over their heads i think that's why there's so many divorces too
sw2152A-ms98-a-0078 274.472375 281.806250 because the money becomes uh an issue the children become an issue the jobs become an issue and it's like you know what's left
sw2152A-ms98-a-0079 281.806250 284.821250 just to argue and that type of thing you know
sw2152A-ms98-a-0080 284.821250 288.518000 [silence]
sw2152A-ms98-a-0081 288.518000 290.655375 i do i do
sw2152A-ms98-a-0082 290.655375 293.667250 they're like between a rock and a hard spot
sw2152A-ms98-a-0083 293.667250 302.588125 it really is awful i think maybe the company should do more with day care centers and that type of thing it might bring families closer
sw2152A-ms98-a-0084 302.588125 306.455000 or mothers to children you know because they're able to spend some time
sw2152A-ms98-a-0085 306.455000 307.522125 at
sw2152A-ms98-a-0086 307.522125 311.748875 [silence]
sw2152A-ms98-a-0087 311.748875 313.235125 yeah

sw2152A-ms98-a-0089 316.428750 317.874625 no huh
sw2152A-ms98-a-0090 317.874625 319.629500 [silence]
sw2152A-ms98-a-0091 319.629500 330.945500 yeah i think that's great because i mean you know you you it's less guilt you feel knowing that you have to leave them everyday if you can go in and see them for ten or fifteen minutes around a lunch hour or
sw2152A-ms98-a-0092 330.945500 333.199000 just know they're close by
sw2152A-ms98-a-0093 333.199000 335.618875 you know it's it's very hard
sw2152A-ms98-a-0094 335.618875 336.915875 [silence]
