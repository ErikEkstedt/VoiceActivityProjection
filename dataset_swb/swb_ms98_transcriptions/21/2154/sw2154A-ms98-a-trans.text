sw2154A-ms98-a-0005 24.904125 28.843000 yeah i don't usually have time to read the newspaper everyday
sw2154A-ms98-a-0006 28.843000 35.068625 so i try to listen to the radio in the morning and and try to catch one of the morning talk shows
sw2154A-ms98-a-0007 35.068625 41.026250 and then i usually end up flipping through CNN and Headline News during the evening
sw2154A-ms98-a-0008 41.026250 44.071625 i always try to read the Sunday paper
sw2154A-ms98-a-0009 44.071625 48.766750 just because it usually gives a summary of the the week's hot events
sw2154A-ms98-a-0010 48.766750 50.067250 [silence]
sw2154A-ms98-a-0011 50.067250 54.090125 so i try to i try to catch that if nothing else
sw2154A-ms98-a-0012 54.090125 61.352625 [silence]
sw2154A-ms98-a-0013 61.352625 68.943375 for for local news i think we do real well where it's we live in a kind of small town
sw2154A-ms98-a-0014 68.943375 73.228750 but i think we get excellent local coverage um
sw2154A-ms98-a-0015 73.228750 79.621875 and i like the national news that we see we we watch NBC and i think they do a real good job
sw2154A-ms98-a-0016 79.621875 83.471375 so i'm i've been real pleased with the quality of the news we get
sw2154A-ms98-a-0017 83.471375 84.967625 how about you
sw2154A-ms98-a-0018 84.967625 103.815000 [silence]

sw2154A-ms98-a-0024 129.164750 138.445750 but i think there's enough news out there that they could pass on more factual information to us and like you said save the commentaries
sw2154A-ms98-a-0025 138.445750 144.720625 because i'm going to listen to the the news and draw my own opinions
sw2154A-ms98-a-0026 144.720625 147.482375 i don't really need their help to do that
sw2154A-ms98-a-0027 147.482375 150.148125 [silence]
sw2154A-ms98-a-0028 150.148125 154.271250 i don't think radio is as bad to do that as TV is

sw2154A-ms98-a-0042 220.349000 221.710000 yeah
sw2154A-ms98-a-0043 221.710000 224.739375 well i had heard a couple of people
sw2154A-ms98-a-0044 224.739375 232.511500 you know that i had talked to about certain programs say that you know they had read other things besides what Sixty Minutes presented
sw2154A-ms98-a-0045 232.511500 236.814375 and that they didn't present it nearly the same way
sw2154A-ms98-a-0046 236.814375 242.453000 as the you know news articles or whatever they had they had already been familiar with
sw2154A-ms98-a-0047 242.453000 244.977375 so i started questioning
sw2154A-ms98-a-0048 244.977375 249.141875 just how how bias they really were
sw2154A-ms98-a-0049 249.141875 250.540875 so
sw2154A-ms98-a-0050 250.540875 263.618125 [silence]
sw2154A-ms98-a-0051 263.618125 264.914125 hum

sw2154A-ms98-a-0053 266.305250 271.260500 no not really you know in the last few years just his
sw2154A-ms98-a-0054 271.260500 281.751875 kind of informal segments i've seen but i never got to see his actual nightly news i liked i- i did grow up with David Brinkley
sw2154A-ms98-a-0055 281.751875 282.982125 uh
sw2154A-ms98-a-0056 282.982125 284.975625 [silence]
sw2154A-ms98-a-0057 284.975625 286.234500 uh-huh
sw2154A-ms98-a-0058 286.234500 290.576750 [silence]
sw2154A-ms98-a-0059 290.576750 296.169250 yeah we we used to watch um him and i guess John Chancellor
sw2154A-ms98-a-0060 296.169250 302.655500 and i always liked David Brinkley and i- and i used to enjoy John Chancellor's style of reporting
sw2154A-ms98-a-0061 302.655500 312.885250 but on the nightly news now he goes into his commentary and that's where i get get into the problem with with him i frequently disagree with his commentaries
sw2154A-ms98-a-0062 312.885250 314.291500 so
sw2154A-ms98-a-0063 314.291500 318.188750 [silence]
sw2154A-ms98-a-0064 318.188750 319.624250 right
sw2154A-ms98-a-0065 319.624250 322.994875 what did you think of the news coverage of the war
sw2154A-ms98-a-0066 322.994875 335.559250 [silence]
sw2154A-ms98-a-0067 335.559250 336.840625 um-hum

sw2154A-ms98-a-0071 346.682875 348.627375 [laughter]
sw2154A-ms98-a-0072 348.627375 349.690000 [silence]
sw2154A-ms98-a-0073 349.690000 356.068500 did that help you understand a lot what was going on your your prior experience with the military
sw2154A-ms98-a-0074 356.068500 357.472750 did
sw2154A-ms98-a-0075 357.472750 366.562500 [silence]
sw2154A-ms98-a-0076 366.562500 371.844000 i wondered if it would help you sometimes fill-in the gaps or recognize
sw2154A-ms98-a-0077 371.844000 376.553000 discrepancies that other people people like myself might not pick up on
sw2154A-ms98-a-0078 376.553000 384.978625 [silence]
sw2154A-ms98-a-0079 384.978625 386.303250 okay
sw2154A-ms98-a-0080 386.303250 388.514750 [silence]
sw2154A-ms98-a-0081 388.514750 392.337500 what weekly um magazine do you look at is it
sw2154A-ms98-a-0082 392.337500 397.941250 [silence]
sw2154A-ms98-a-0083 397.941250 399.151375 uh-huh
sw2154A-ms98-a-0084 399.151375 400.167250 [silence]
sw2154A-ms98-a-0085 400.167250 401.406000 sure
sw2154A-ms98-a-0086 401.406000 407.308500 [silence]
sw2154A-ms98-a-0087 407.308500 418.396375 does it give a pretty good overview of everything or like does it give um i guess little encapsulated reports and and then a few big stories
sw2154A-ms98-a-0088 418.396375 427.502750 [silence]
sw2154A-ms98-a-0089 427.502750 428.777000 yeah
sw2154A-ms98-a-0090 428.777000 440.533125 [silence]
sw2154A-ms98-a-0091 440.533125 446.026000 that sounds good if you were short on time you could get a summary real quick
sw2154A-ms98-a-0092 446.026000 453.410750 [silence]
sw2154A-ms98-a-0093 453.410750 454.700875 right

sw2154A-ms98-a-0097 469.665375 473.121750 well we're working on a Newsweek
sw2154A-ms98-a-0098 473.121750 483.688000 uh for the last couple of months we got you know an introductory subscription so we decided to try it because prior to that all we got were things like
sw2154A-ms98-a-0099 483.688000 490.426375 Glamour or Sports Illustrated so we decided to try to bring one in that was
sw2154A-ms98-a-0100 490.426375 493.716375 a little bit better for us so to speak
sw2154A-ms98-a-0101 493.716375 497.056375 [silence]
sw2154A-ms98-a-0102 497.056375 498.195125 it can't hurt
sw2154A-ms98-a-0103 498.195125 500.052125 [laughter]
sw2154A-ms98-a-0104 500.052125 501.151250 [vocalized-noise]
sw2154A-ms98-a-0105 501.151250 502.374000 [silence]
sw2154A-ms98-a-0106 502.374000 503.892750 no
sw2154A-ms98-a-0107 503.892750 508.360875 i- i even i enjoy reading T News
sw2154A-ms98-a-0108 508.360875 510.403250 i try to catch it
sw2154A-ms98-a-0109 510.403250 516.207375 because it's another example they just they just show you the words and the facts
sw2154A-ms98-a-0110 516.207375 523.038500 and they they don't offer any commentary and it gives me a quick chance to to be caught up during the day
sw2154A-ms98-a-0111 523.038500 527.040000 because you know we don't listen to the radio at work at all
sw2154A-ms98-a-0112 527.040000 530.904375 so i don't like to go the whole day without hearing anything
sw2154A-ms98-a-0113 530.904375 536.903000 [silence]
sw2154A-ms98-a-0114 536.903000 538.152500 yeah
sw2154A-ms98-a-0115 538.152500 545.372375 and the other thing we have that i like to check sometimes is um Talking Fingers do you have that
sw2154A-ms98-a-0116 545.372375 546.432000 [silence]
sw2154A-ms98-a-0117 546.432000 553.811375 you have different telephone numbers that you can dial and then you dial in an access code
sw2154A-ms98-a-0118 553.811375 561.908875 and it will depending on what topic you called in to hear about whether it was the news or the weather or a soap opera update
sw2154A-ms98-a-0119 561.908875 566.213125 it will give you um updated information
sw2154A-ms98-a-0120 566.213125 575.329875 so it can give you you know current news updates current weather updates things like that and it's it's offered through the local phone company free of charge
sw2154A-ms98-a-0121 575.329875 580.097500 so that's an interesting alternative occasionally that i like to use
sw2154A-ms98-a-0122 580.097500 581.511250 [silence]
sw2154A-ms98-a-0123 581.511250 582.571500 it
sw2154A-ms98-a-0124 582.571500 583.575625 [silence]
sw2154A-ms98-a-0125 583.575625 592.392875 it really is yeah it really is nice i mean because it gives you a wide variety of things you can call and talk and find out about
sw2154A-ms98-a-0126 592.392875 598.396500 so that is something you might keep your eyes open for i think it's it's catching on throughout the country
sw2154A-ms98-a-0127 598.396500 599.663000 [silence]
