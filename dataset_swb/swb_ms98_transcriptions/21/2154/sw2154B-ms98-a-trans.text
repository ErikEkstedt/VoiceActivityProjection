sw2154B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 4.564250 [noise]
sw2154B-ms98-a-0002 4.564250 10.985625 [noise] normally i listen to CNN or Headline News about an hour a day
sw2154B-ms98-a-0003 10.985625 13.979125 and then i supplement that with uh
sw2154B-ms98-a-0004 13.979125 15.848875 radio news
sw2154B-ms98-a-0005 15.848875 18.256250 from my car radio
sw2154B-ms98-a-0006 18.256250 21.389000 and from a news magazine
sw2154B-ms98-a-0007 21.389000 22.822625 once a week
sw2154B-ms98-a-0008 22.822625 25.184625 and a newspaper if i have time
sw2154B-ms98-a-0009 25.184625 54.415750 [silence]
sw2154B-ms98-a-0010 54.415750 61.679250 that's true and and how do you rate the uh h[ow]- are you pleased with the news coverage that you're receiving
sw2154B-ms98-a-0011 61.679250 85.147250 [silence]
sw2154B-ms98-a-0012 85.147250 95.364625 on the whole i'm pleased when i have an opportunity to hear just the facts i would much prefer that they keep their analysis to themselves
sw2154B-ms98-a-0013 95.364625 96.748125 um
sw2154B-ms98-a-0014 96.748125 97.783625 [silence]
sw2154B-ms98-a-0015 97.783625 104.660125 since i don't necessarily agree with it or it tends to be extraordinarily trite
sw2154B-ms98-a-0016 104.660125 108.810875 uh i think i'm fed up with trite
sw2154B-ms98-a-0017 108.810875 112.342875 there seems to be more and more of it
sw2154B-ms98-a-0018 112.342875 119.851875 and i understand the void that uh comes naturally with both
sw2154B-ms98-a-0019 119.851875 128.405500 radio presentations and television presentations and a[s]- as expensive as they are to produce they certainly don't want any dead airspace
sw2154B-ms98-a-0020 128.405500 147.225250 [silence]
sw2154B-ms98-a-0021 147.225250 150.414375 i [vocalized-noise] i we're certainly in agreement there
sw2154B-ms98-a-0022 150.414375 151.428250 uh
sw2154B-ms98-a-0023 151.428250 154.583625 [silence]
sw2154B-ms98-a-0024 154.583625 164.802875 radio seems to have a full platter or full plate of different things that they need to get done they're maybe they're a little more efficient
sw2154B-ms98-a-0025 164.802875 171.116500 or have more to do over that same time frame i don't know which that answer is
sw2154B-ms98-a-0026 171.116500 173.657375 uh i think the
sw2154B-ms98-a-0027 173.657375 180.423750 my greatest complaint about news programs is programs like Sixty Minutes do you watch that
sw2154B-ms98-a-0028 180.423750 185.442125 [silence]
sw2154B-ms98-a-0029 185.442125 189.208000 well i used to watch Sixty Minutes until they did
sw2154B-ms98-a-0030 189.208000 193.366625 two programs uh that i knew
sw2154B-ms98-a-0031 193.366625 197.299375 both the people and the inc[idences]- incidences
sw2154B-ms98-a-0032 197.299375 202.643625 and i knew that they had presented an extremely slanted viewpoint
sw2154B-ms98-a-0033 202.643625 208.526250 that was in my estimate nowhere near truth but was much better for ratings
sw2154B-ms98-a-0034 208.526250 209.560375 [silence]
sw2154B-ms98-a-0035 209.560375 213.492750 and it ever since that time i just don't watch
sw2154B-ms98-a-0036 213.492750 215.317250 [silence]
sw2154B-ms98-a-0037 215.317250 221.712250 uh so i guess we have the the same reaction whether we came about it from the same place or not
sw2154B-ms98-a-0038 221.712250 250.395750 [silence]
sw2154B-ms98-a-0039 250.395750 264.009000 i don't know di[d]- i don't know how old you are but it seems to me like the last uh newscaster that presented news in just the nice simple factual way that i wanted to hear was Walter Cronkite
sw2154B-ms98-a-0040 264.009000 267.428250 so i don't i don't know if you're familiar with him or not
sw2154B-ms98-a-0041 267.428250 281.665375 [silence]
sw2154B-ms98-a-0042 281.665375 285.481500 well Brinkley was sort of trying to be in the mold
sw2154B-ms98-a-0043 285.481500 292.339000 of Cronkite and he did a a pretty good job The Huntley Brinkley Report was quite excellent over the years
sw2154B-ms98-a-0044 292.339000 312.961500 [silence]
sw2154B-ms98-a-0045 312.961500 318.147125 well once they've reported the facts all they can offer is an opinion anymore
sw2154B-ms98-a-0046 318.147125 323.943625 [silence]
sw2154B-ms98-a-0047 323.943625 336.026625 well i almost felt like it was too much indeed i found myself restricting my viewing to a couple of hours a day one in the morning and one in the evening
sw2154B-ms98-a-0048 336.026625 337.380875 uh
sw2154B-ms98-a-0049 337.380875 338.500000 [vocalized-noise]
sw2154B-ms98-a-0050 338.500000 342.537875 i spent a number of years in the service as an intelligence analyst
sw2154B-ms98-a-0051 342.537875 344.956625 and i don't need their
sw2154B-ms98-a-0052 344.956625 347.447375 fill-ins you know [laughter]
sw2154B-ms98-a-0053 347.447375 356.275125 [silence]
sw2154B-ms98-a-0054 356.275125 361.919500 yes but i- i think it helps me everyday in trying to review
sw2154B-ms98-a-0055 361.919500 366.260500 wh[at]- the state that the world is in and try to guess where we're going
sw2154B-ms98-a-0056 366.260500 377.311250 [silence]
sw2154B-ms98-a-0057 377.311250 385.376375 well i- i think uh my background is probably what absolutely turned me off with Sixty Minutes
sw2154B-ms98-a-0058 385.376375 392.087125 [silence]
sw2154B-ms98-a-0059 392.087125 396.248750 i like US News and World Report at one time or another i've
sw2154B-ms98-a-0060 396.248750 401.041625 taken them all for a year i [laughter-believe] in giving anything a chance
sw2154B-ms98-a-0061 401.041625 404.755125 uh but i keep coming back to that one
sw2154B-ms98-a-0062 404.755125 407.685750 so i that's kind of my favorite
sw2154B-ms98-a-0063 407.685750 418.525625 [silence]
sw2154B-ms98-a-0064 418.525625 423.491625 it's primarily um a few big stories
sw2154B-ms98-a-0065 423.491625 428.337750 and then lots of high-level reports
sw2154B-ms98-a-0066 428.337750 436.821625 uh here's what went on in Asia over the past week and there's maybe a page of that little brief paragraphs
sw2154B-ms98-a-0067 436.821625 441.096125 unless that was one of their the focus of their main stories
sw2154B-ms98-a-0068 441.096125 445.581875 [silence]
sw2154B-ms98-a-0069 445.581875 454.168375 uh it too is one those you know [vocalized-noise] in the interest of efficiency we all have to find ways and i do most of my reading in the bathroom
sw2154B-ms98-a-0070 454.168375 464.547125 um and it's one of those that i can ei[ther]- read either an article or a couple of pages of those brief excerpts in the time frame that i'm going to spend in there
sw2154B-ms98-a-0071 464.547125 469.644000 and it just seems to fit nicely so that i can get it read in about three days
sw2154B-ms98-a-0072 469.644000 493.800250 [silence]
sw2154B-ms98-a-0073 493.800250 497.703000 well to broaden your horizons make you think about different things anyway
sw2154B-ms98-a-0074 497.703000 499.994625 [silence]
sw2154B-ms98-a-0075 499.994625 503.264250 well anytime that we stop and think it can't hurt
sw2154B-ms98-a-0076 503.264250 530.731000 [silence]
sw2154B-ms98-a-0077 530.731000 534.642000 oh i'm with you i have to check T News every everyday
sw2154B-ms98-a-0078 534.642000 537.722500 it's my noontime dose of facts
sw2154B-ms98-a-0079 537.722500 545.295375 [silence]
sw2154B-ms98-a-0080 545.295375 546.414750 no
sw2154B-ms98-a-0081 546.414750 575.180250 [silence]
sw2154B-ms98-a-0082 575.180250 576.434750 hum
sw2154B-ms98-a-0083 576.434750 579.799375 [silence]
sw2154B-ms98-a-0084 579.799375 585.708500 well it does sound very interesting maybe our phone company out here will get around to offering something like that 
sw2154B-ms98-a-0085 585.708500 599.663000 [silence]
