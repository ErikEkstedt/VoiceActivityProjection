sw2157A-ms98-a-0012 21.957750 26.148500 [silence]
sw2157A-ms98-a-0013 26.148500 30.271125 yeah as long as Troy [vocalized-noise] Aikman doesn't get hurt again
sw2157A-ms98-a-0014 30.271125 33.437000 that kind of killed them at the end of the season last year
sw2157A-ms98-a-0015 33.437000 35.169750 [silence]
sw2157A-ms98-a-0016 35.169750 38.651375 so i don't i don't even know who your favorite team is actually
sw2157A-ms98-a-0017 38.651375 39.707750 [silence]
sw2157A-ms98-a-0018 39.707750 42.006625 okay i think i did know that
sw2157A-ms98-a-0019 42.006625 43.850250 i just forgot
sw2157A-ms98-a-0020 43.850250 45.745375 okay
sw2157A-ms98-a-0021 45.745375 49.992000 yeah has Herschel Walker done much for them
sw2157A-ms98-a-0022 49.992000 54.995375 [silence]
sw2157A-ms98-a-0023 54.995375 58.750875 definitely well he was a good player i guess
sw2157A-ms98-a-0024 58.750875 61.317500 i don't know he just never
sw2157A-ms98-a-0025 61.317500 64.452250 i don't know for a while there he just [vocalized-noise]
sw2157A-ms98-a-0026 64.452250 72.540875 well he could always get past you know he'd get past like six or seven tackles and just keep spinning around and get on into the end zone
sw2157A-ms98-a-0027 72.540875 84.524750 but um i guess you never could really see him play because with the Cowboys while he was with the team the rest of the team was pretty poor so you couldn't really tell if it was just him or the team
sw2157A-ms98-a-0028 84.524750 88.380250 and i always just assumed he was too good for the rest of the team but
sw2157A-ms98-a-0029 88.380250 90.309125 i don't know
sw2157A-ms98-a-0030 90.309125 93.594250 [silence]
sw2157A-ms98-a-0031 93.594250 96.606500 Emmitt Smith yeah he's been doing real good
sw2157A-ms98-a-0032 96.606500 105.310375 i'm pretty impressed with him so far did he did he actually play in the Pro Bowl i remember he was like a backup and then somebody got injured and he was supposed to go
sw2157A-ms98-a-0033 105.310375 107.099250 [silence]
sw2157A-ms98-a-0034 107.099250 118.883000 yeah i kind of i haven't been keeping up with football i mean in the fall i- i can go on and on about football but since it's kind of off season it's kind of hard to think back about all that
sw2157A-ms98-a-0035 118.883000 120.967625 but uh
sw2157A-ms98-a-0036 120.967625 136.825500 [laughter]
sw2157A-ms98-a-0037 136.825500 138.016625 yeah

sw2157A-ms98-a-0039 152.114250 155.534625 um i have no idea
sw2157A-ms98-a-0040 155.534625 157.952125 no earthly idea
sw2157A-ms98-a-0041 157.952125 170.402500 [silence]
sw2157A-ms98-a-0042 170.402500 174.335125 how did they end up this year did they did they make it to the play-offs at all
sw2157A-ms98-a-0043 174.335125 181.484500 [silence]
sw2157A-ms98-a-0044 181.484500 182.594750 um

sw2157A-ms98-a-0046 183.739875 187.069750 [silence]
sw2157A-ms98-a-0047 187.069750 188.997875 kind of like the Cowboys huh
sw2157A-ms98-a-0048 188.997875 191.356500 [silence]
sw2157A-ms98-a-0049 191.356500 195.860250 except i think the Cowboys are on the upswing i don't know about the [laughter-Vikings]
sw2157A-ms98-a-0050 195.860250 196.941125 [silence]
sw2157A-ms98-a-0051 196.941125 198.900250 just hadn't heard much about them lately
sw2157A-ms98-a-0052 198.900250 209.436125 [silence]
sw2157A-ms98-a-0053 209.436125 211.046500 yeah
sw2157A-ms98-a-0054 211.046500 225.657875 well the Cardinals i don't know [laughter] i think the Cowboys probably have a a better team they just at the end of the season the kind of got messed up with Aikman getting hurt because_1 uh Laufenberg just couldn't never really get it together
sw2157A-ms98-a-0055 225.657875 232.355875 at all of course he sat along the sidelines all season he never really got in a game never did a whole lot
sw2157A-ms98-a-0056 232.355875 233.851000 well
sw2157A-ms98-a-0057 233.851000 239.620000 i'm just saying i shouldn't i shouldn't blast him like that say oh well Laufenberg got out there and blew it for them_1 i mean
sw2157A-ms98-a-0058 239.620000 243.340250 he didn't get to see much action but it's too bad
sw2157A-ms98-a-0059 243.340250 252.540250 because_1 now now you know he had a shot and and didn't look too good and so no one is going to have much faith in him any more
sw2157A-ms98-a-0060 252.540250 253.990750 [silence]
sw2157A-ms98-a-0061 253.990750 262.997125 in fact i think they're getting a different guy for a backup quarterback i haven't uh i haven't kept up with it lately but i remember reading something
sw2157A-ms98-a-0062 262.997125 273.498500 a few months ago about them signing somebody else on or or trying to go after somebody or trade for somebody but it wasn't anybody i'd really heard of
sw2157A-ms98-a-0063 273.498500 284.797625 but i heard on the radio this morning or yesterday morning that uh Aikman's back in practicing doing real real well um who is it Michael Irvin
sw2157A-ms98-a-0064 284.797625 295.248875 [vocalized-noise] he said that uh Aikman was hitting him right on the numbers every time so sounds like he's going to be all right for next season they're just trying not to overwork him right now until he gets his shoulder
sw2157A-ms98-a-0065 295.248875 301.437500 uh back in shape it was his shoulder wasn't it [laughter] that he had problems with
sw2157A-ms98-a-0066 301.437500 307.114875 i think it i think it was his shoulder he had surgery on but anyway they're trying to keep him
sw2157A-ms98-a-0067 307.114875 312.458375 you know keep him uh from reinjuring anything but
sw2157A-ms98-a-0068 312.458375 315.058000 anyway [laughter]
sw2157A-ms98-a-0069 315.058000 322.012875 [silence]
sw2157A-ms98-a-0070 322.012875 324.274500 thirty day notice for what

sw2157A-ms98-a-0072 329.397875 330.883500 oh really

sw2157A-ms98-a-0074 337.996625 345.800500 what [laughter] oh okay [laughter] maybe i'll call you back after [laughter] after the recording is finished
sw2157A-ms98-a-0075 345.800500 350.171875 actually i think we have talked about football for five minutes i- i can't remember
sw2157A-ms98-a-0076 350.171875 352.518625 [silence]
sw2157A-ms98-a-0077 352.518625 355.170125 really i usually have too
sw2157A-ms98-a-0078 355.170125 356.352375 [silence]
sw2157A-ms98-a-0079 356.352375 358.825250 yeah i've done that once or twice
sw2157A-ms98-a-0080 358.825250 365.600000 i didn't look at the clock when we started talking so i guess we should talk about football a little bit longer just to be sure we got five minutes in
sw2157A-ms98-a-0081 365.600000 366.974875 [silence]
sw2157A-ms98-a-0082 366.974875 368.031375 yeah
sw2157A-ms98-a-0083 368.031375 369.230000 [silence]
sw2157A-ms98-a-0084 369.230000 371.212250 so other than the Vikings who do you like
sw2157A-ms98-a-0085 371.212250 377.091875 [silence]
sw2157A-ms98-a-0086 377.091875 378.386625 uh oh
sw2157A-ms98-a-0087 378.386625 384.338000 [silence]
sw2157A-ms98-a-0088 384.338000 385.478875 yeah
sw2157A-ms98-a-0089 385.478875 397.475500 [silence]
sw2157A-ms98-a-0090 397.475500 399.183125 um-hum
sw2157A-ms98-a-0091 399.183125 401.802375 back when they were in Saint Louis
sw2157A-ms98-a-0092 401.802375 404.649875 [silence]
sw2157A-ms98-a-0093 404.649875 409.119625 [laughter] since they've been to Phoenix they haven't been uh
sw2157A-ms98-a-0094 409.119625 411.489750 all that impressive i guess
sw2157A-ms98-a-0095 411.489750 421.905375 i guess i've always been a Cowboy fan other than that i mean you know when i've you know when you grow up in a city that has the you know one of the greatest football teams until the last few years you kind of tend to
sw2157A-ms98-a-0096 421.905375 423.468875 get caught up in it
sw2157A-ms98-a-0097 423.468875 424.390125 [silence]
sw2157A-ms98-a-0098 424.390125 425.654500 yeah
sw2157A-ms98-a-0099 425.654500 433.745125 yeah i mean it it was really exciting growing up when when the Cowboys were really big because_1 my parents would always have season tickets and they'd go to all the games and
sw2157A-ms98-a-0100 433.745125 440.053500 you know the hype were just unbelievable it's just you know the last oh i guess probably since about eighty four
sw2157A-ms98-a-0101 440.053500 451.040625 about eighty five was when they started kind of going downhill really but you know i'm just used to always growing up and hearing Cowboys Cowboys Cowboys and you know Super Bowl and all this other stuff so
sw2157A-ms98-a-0102 451.040625 463.155250 i can't you know i'm not going to decide i don't like them_1 just because_1 they're having a few bad years i mean i think they'll pull out of it and you know they'll they'll wind up being good again they've got some lot of really good young players that are going to
sw2157A-ms98-a-0103 463.155250 466.996500 that are going to uh do pretty good i think
sw2157A-ms98-a-0104 466.996500 469.019500 [silence]
sw2157A-ms98-a-0105 469.019500 474.085250 but they're raising prices on their tickets so they're banking on doing good next season
sw2157A-ms98-a-0106 474.085250 476.854000 i think tickets are yeah
sw2157A-ms98-a-0107 476.854000 488.996000 thirty or thirty two for really good tickets see they they sectioned it out even more they used to just have like uh first of all it was all one price and then they sectioned it out to end zone and then everything else
sw2157A-ms98-a-0108 488.996000 491.948125 and now they're sectioning it off to like from the
sw2157A-ms98-a-0109 491.948125 496.975375 from one twenty yard line to the other one just on the lower levels is the highest price
sw2157A-ms98-a-0110 496.975375 511.302500 and then the next highest price is that same area but above it on the upper level and then like from the twenty to the ten yard line and then they're some sections kind of in the corner areas and then the cheapest of course is going to be the end the direct end zones
sw2157A-ms98-a-0111 511.302500 523.829875 but um they have about four or five different prices now that they're structuring it with but obviously yeah they're all going up even more or less is what it's going to do
sw2157A-ms98-a-0112 523.829875 528.792000 [silence]
sw2157A-ms98-a-0113 528.792000 533.611875 um you know i'm not sure i'm not positive i didn't
sw2157A-ms98-a-0114 533.611875 543.197250 i didn't really think about that i just remember trying to figure out where you could get that was real close to the good section [laughter-but] [laughter-in] [laughter-the] [laughter-little] [laughter-bit] [laughter-cheaper]
sw2157A-ms98-a-0115 543.197250 557.132125 but not that i'll ever go i hadn't been to a Cowboys game last time last time i went to the Cowboys game was during that um NFL strike or the when they had the scab team teams in there and it was the uh Dallas and Washington Redskins game
sw2157A-ms98-a-0116 557.132125 563.412500 and i went because_1 my dad can usually get a hold of some free tickets because_1 a lot of those doctors have season tickets and they um
sw2157A-ms98-a-0117 563.412500 574.349250 if they're not going to use them_1 they'll give them_1 to somebody else so my dad i went with my dad to a game that one time but that wasn't a real you know it was it was the scab teams it was kind of
sw2157A-ms98-a-0118 574.349250 583.710875 you know it was kind of different i guess and before that it's been quite a few years i've been wanting to go to a game i just never never have gotten around to it
sw2157A-ms98-a-0119 583.710875 585.530000 so maybe this year
sw2157A-ms98-a-0120 585.530000 598.958125 Texans [noise] cheap cheaper i guess [noise] [laughter] [noise]
