sw2179A-ms98-a-0016 65.717375 79.251000 all kind of weather from the Atlantic Ocean you know and that drives our weather nutsy sometimes we'll get the clouds and the wind coming the right way and the storms will just pour in moisture and pump anything from snow to rain depending on the temperature you know
sw2179A-ms98-a-0017 79.251000 80.187625 [silence]

sw2179A-ms98-a-0027 138.063000 150.384500 well i did too about a month ago i had a a real severe cold but nothing that required you know um a doctor's visit or anything like that i was just able to take some aspirin and rest for a couple of days but it just seemed like it
sw2179A-ms98-a-0028 150.384500 160.635125 you're absolutely right you don't know how to dress you go out in the morning with real heavy clothes on because it's real cold and by noontime you're taking everything off you know to to go walk around the site and stuff
sw2179A-ms98-a-0029 160.635125 169.944875 and and it's unreal that uh uh you know by evening you can drop back twenty thirty degrees it's just the weather changes so quick you know
sw2179A-ms98-a-0030 169.944875 176.651875 and if you don't have coats and sweaters with you of course by then you're all sweated up and warm and that's how i think a lot folks carry

sw2179A-ms98-a-0035 196.928750 209.636875 you're right you're sure right it's it's nice to look at but the last couple of storms we've had the last couple of snowstorms we've had have really been good because they snowed and and like within a day it's warmed right back up and melted the roads and stuff so
sw2179A-ms98-a-0036 209.636875 213.769125 we're able to get around pretty good and it didn't stay too long on the sides of the roads but

sw2179A-ms98-a-0049 255.029375 260.557875 but West Texas now was a hundred and ten and i didn't mind that at all you know because it was so dry

sw2179A-ms98-a-0057 293.979500 299.404750 it was like a hundred and twenty five or something and it it didn't feel that hot
sw2179A-ms98-a-0058 299.404750 306.200000 it it like strange that it you're right in the middle of the mountains and it's so brown and dry but boy you just didn't feel
sw2179A-ms98-a-0059 306.200000 308.041250 it didn't feel that hot
sw2179A-ms98-a-0060 308.041250 309.672000 [silence]
sw2179A-ms98-a-0061 309.672000 321.416000 uh-huh yeah [laughter] that's the hard thing out that way but uh i liked Riverside though the weather in Riverside was pretty good in California wa[s]- it wa[s]- i have a son lives in Riverside and one lives in Corona so
sw2179A-ms98-a-0062 321.416000 322.440875 [silence]
sw2179A-ms98-a-0063 322.440875 336.583625 that was pretty good but the weather here in New England like like they say if you don't like it too well well just stick around a little bit and [vocalized-noise] and it it will change up and give you something that you may like worse or like more it all depends [laughter-on] on Mother Nature's kind of fickle up this way i guess
sw2179A-ms98-a-0064 336.583625 351.299375 [silence]
sw2179A-ms98-a-0065 351.299375 355.859125 uh-huh that sounds like it yeah that sounds yeah i imagine it would that this
sw2179A-ms98-a-0066 355.859125 365.151375 that's what we get real cold weather where the wind blows down out of Canada is called that uh Canadian express and boy that winds comes down and it and it seems to make a big dip
sw2179A-ms98-a-0067 365.151375 373.329625 sometimes it dips all the way down to you folks down in Texas and then it roars back up the east coast here by the time we get it it is hauling some cold weather
sw2179A-ms98-a-0068 373.329625 379.810625 [silence]
sw2179A-ms98-a-0069 379.810625 380.966250 yeah

sw2179A-ms98-a-0071 389.559625 394.225500 boy that's unreal when you think about it you know that's that must be something uh to
sw2179A-ms98-a-0072 394.225500 404.989750 well they say these big icebergs that you see floating out here in the north Atlantic then you see the tip of them they look like small mountains and that's only like one third of the iceberg the rest of it submerged under the water
sw2179A-ms98-a-0073 404.989750 414.540875 and that's been uh uh a problem you know to to the merchant people that that fish and stuff up here they run into that ice stuff in the winter and it breaks away
sw2179A-ms98-a-0074 414.540875 417.887500 [silence]
sw2179A-ms98-a-0075 417.887500 425.252875 i've lived here all my life and i worked uh i've been with uh TI fifteen years ten of it in in Texas five years up here

sw2179A-ms98-a-0081 440.107000 444.399750 [silence]
sw2179A-ms98-a-0082 444.399750 453.710500 it's nice the best time to come up here is like in in the fall in the late fall and look at the leaves turn colors because that's that's something that you just can't paint a picture of or
sw2179A-ms98-a-0083 453.710500 457.702375 and the cold weather is starting to come in when the leaves start turning colors
sw2179A-ms98-a-0084 457.702375 463.920000 and uh that that's really nice to look at uh the summers are hot pardon me
sw2179A-ms98-a-0085 463.920000 465.343000 [silence]
sw2179A-ms98-a-0086 465.343000 474.720875 no we have a lot of maple up here and oak mostly oak and maple is is a and and pine of course evergreens up as you get up north into the northern part of the
sw2179A-ms98-a-0087 474.720875 477.825500 the eastern corner here it's all pine trees and
sw2179A-ms98-a-0088 477.825500 481.059250 but uh i guess the hardwoods are probably
sw2179A-ms98-a-0089 481.059250 486.490375 the biggest thing we have are our hard maple and hard oak and and the the evergreens
sw2179A-ms98-a-0090 486.490375 487.519750 [silence]
sw2179A-ms98-a-0091 487.519750 495.387500 but that's scattered with birch trees and stuff and uh it's real pretty when the leaves all turn colors because you get a multiple array of colors and
sw2179A-ms98-a-0092 495.387500 502.221500 people come from all over the world come through New England only like that [noise] week or two when the colors are the brightest you know

sw2179A-ms98-a-0098 524.509750 529.150500 we might get one more little snowstorm in April but i don't think it will amount to much
sw2179A-ms98-a-0099 529.150500 537.741000 [silence]
sw2179A-ms98-a-0100 537.741000 549.356625 that's what i noticed when i was there was the ice storms you got around February one time i flew into DFW and it was iced over [laughter] we had to go into Love Field because_1 we just couldn't get into DFW

sw2179A-ms98-a-0107 561.502750 574.867000 yep you're absolutely right i think it does it kills germs and bugs and the same thing up here if we get a hard hard freeze in the ground we get a lot of a lot of bugs and stuff in the lawns that are no longer there in the spring but if we don't boy they just seem to jump right out
sw2179A-ms98-a-0108 574.867000 576.049875 and
