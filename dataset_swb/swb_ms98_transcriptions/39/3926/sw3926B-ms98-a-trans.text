sw3926B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.224750 [noise]
sw3926B-ms98-a-0002 0.224750 1.008250 yes
sw3926B-ms98-a-0003 1.008250 15.893125 [silence]
sw3926B-ms98-a-0004 15.893125 16.940000 yeah
sw3926B-ms98-a-0005 16.940000 17.860375 [silence]
sw3926B-ms98-a-0006 17.860375 29.111875 well as i look at our trial systems i think they've gotten to be quite a joke the way that people can appeal and file for mistrials and they've taken a lot of the things that that were set up to make it be a fair system
sw3926B-ms98-a-0007 29.111875 31.212125 and used it to their advantage
sw3926B-ms98-a-0008 31.212125 34.770000 i think that a jury should listen to the court
sw3926B-ms98-a-0009 34.770000 41.677625 uh to to the hearings and to everything but i think they should only weigh fifty percent of the decision
sw3926B-ms98-a-0010 41.677625 48.284500 i think the judge should hold the fi[fty]- or maybe even forty nine and the judge should be able to rule one way or the other
sw3926B-ms98-a-0011 48.284500 51.071500 [silence]
sw3926B-ms98-a-0012 51.071500 56.787500 i think he should and i think that there should be more than one judge there should be maybe two
sw3926B-ms98-a-0013 56.787500 62.414625 at least that sit in and listen so that there's no way that you could have
sw3926B-ms98-a-0014 62.414625 64.970125 like a crooked judge do you know what i mean
sw3926B-ms98-a-0015 64.970125 65.999125 [silence]
sw3926B-ms98-a-0016 65.999125 69.658375 um and i think that there it's important to have a jury
sw3926B-ms98-a-0017 69.658375 78.843125 but i think the way that they go through so much time to get a a fair one that's okay too as long as it's not used to delay the trial so much
sw3926B-ms98-a-0018 78.843125 83.288625 they need to have a fair jury but they only wou[ld]- you know would cover
sw3926B-ms98-a-0019 83.288625 91.845875 fif[ty]- forty nine percent of the decision or fifty percent and then the two judges would go ahead and make the final decision
sw3926B-ms98-a-0020 91.845875 93.156000 [silence]
sw3926B-ms98-a-0021 93.156000 94.986000 how do you feel about that
sw3926B-ms98-a-0022 94.986000 110.174750 [silence]
sw3926B-ms98-a-0023 110.174750 111.408500 right
sw3926B-ms98-a-0024 111.408500 145.634625 [silence]
sw3926B-ms98-a-0025 145.634625 146.998375 right
sw3926B-ms98-a-0026 146.998375 159.957250 [silence]
sw3926B-ms98-a-0027 159.957250 161.143125 right
sw3926B-ms98-a-0028 161.143125 163.184375 [silence]
sw3926B-ms98-a-0029 163.184375 169.649875 right well what if they used you know i just had a thought come as you were talking what if they used law students
sw3926B-ms98-a-0030 169.649875 173.871125 and had that be credit hours to sit in trials
sw3926B-ms98-a-0031 173.871125 177.608125 [silence]
sw3926B-ms98-a-0032 177.608125 187.377500 yeah at least at least on the jury and that would give them experience in the courtroom and it could count as some aspect or hours going into their major
sw3926B-ms98-a-0033 187.377500 190.706125 [silence]
sw3926B-ms98-a-0034 190.706125 191.922500 right
sw3926B-ms98-a-0035 191.922500 194.502500 [silence]
sw3926B-ms98-a-0036 194.502500 197.736125 that's right that would be a really good thing to do
sw3926B-ms98-a-0037 197.736125 202.894625 [laughter] i i have a girlfriend that just went through a three year trial
sw3926B-ms98-a-0038 202.894625 205.826625 and what happened was her husband was um
sw3926B-ms98-a-0039 205.826625 211.732250 involved in a motorcycle accident where a drunk driver ran the stop light and ran into the motorcycle
sw3926B-ms98-a-0040 211.732250 218.945875 but the reason the actual reason that the motorcycle person her husband was killed was because his brakes
sw3926B-ms98-a-0041 218.945875 226.172500 went out on his motorcycle he was just taking it home from the place it was brand new and his brakes did not work
sw3926B-ms98-a-0042 226.172500 230.806500 and this expensive big company that owned these motorcycles
sw3926B-ms98-a-0043 230.806500 237.936000 um railroaded this into three years worth of trials for this lady and she had a son that was just only two years old when it happened
sw3926B-ms98-a-0044 237.936000 241.964125 and they were following him home in the car saw the whole thing happen
sw3926B-ms98-a-0045 241.964125 243.010250 [silence]
sw3926B-ms98-a-0046 243.010250 246.776125 that's right they were following him home from the motorcycle shop
sw3926B-ms98-a-0047 246.776125 256.832375 and they railroaded this whole trial into mistrials um this and that and the other every time she'd get a verdict that would be in her favor of a of a settlement
sw3926B-ms98-a-0048 256.832375 262.448750 until finally they won and said that it was the drunk driver's fault and she would have to sue him
sw3926B-ms98-a-0049 262.448750 270.376250 which i would think it would be some his fault but i just felt like justice wasn't served because they had the money the big lawyers and she didn't
sw3926B-ms98-a-0050 270.376250 275.698375 [silence]
sw3926B-ms98-a-0051 275.698375 276.983875 right
sw3926B-ms98-a-0052 276.983875 283.541625 [silence]
sw3926B-ms98-a-0053 283.541625 289.780125 right and i don't know all the details on that but i certainly think that we've come up with a good idea with the
sw3926B-ms98-a-0054 289.780125 293.150125 the stu[dent]- the students coming into the jury
sw3926B-ms98-a-0055 293.150125 298.395750 and i don't think that it would be such a bad idea even if the judge didn't have the final say
sw3926B-ms98-a-0056 298.395750 298.946000 [silence]
