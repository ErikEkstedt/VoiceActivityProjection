sw3940A-ms98-a-0022 122.067500 123.517875 [silence]

sw3940A-ms98-a-0025 128.349250 136.227125 [noise] yeah i do as a matter of fact they had one not too long ago and one of the questions was what is the most populous country uh south of the equator 
sw3940A-ms98-a-0026 136.227125 139.890500 you know and i would have guessed Brazil it turned out it was South Africa
sw3940A-ms98-a-0027 139.890500 148.995625 yeah which i would have never i don't know for some reason that never would have popped in my mind now what what good that knowledge is i don't know but it was a interesting piece of trivia
sw3940A-ms98-a-0028 148.995625 155.162750 [silence]
sw3940A-ms98-a-0029 155.162750 165.280750 uh again i there have been you know a couple of times when i thought you know golly i i could have you know i could have won tonight and then again there are other times when i watch and
sw3940A-ms98-a-0030 165.280750 179.370375 you know i know that i wouldn't have done so well but uh yeah i guess anybody that that watches those uh you know probably thinks uh occasionally about it the interesting thing about Jeopardy is that they never do uh
sw3940A-ms98-a-0031 179.370375 190.836250 uh give any information on how to compete they do say that if you're going to be in the Los Angeles area and want free tickets they tell you how to get that but they don't ever say anything about uh uh

sw3940A-ms98-a-0035 205.970000 209.487750 [silence]
