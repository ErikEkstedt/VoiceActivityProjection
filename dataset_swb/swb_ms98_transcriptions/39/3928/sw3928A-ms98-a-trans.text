sw3928A-ms98-a-0002 2.001625 3.305875 [silence]
sw3928A-ms98-a-0003 3.305875 7.587875 yeah neither do i i think that uh it's something that uh
sw3928A-ms98-a-0004 7.587875 18.451750 uh i i can appreciate if uh i were an employer or uh that uh i would want to uh [noise] ascertain the state of the uh employee
sw3928A-ms98-a-0005 18.451750 21.629375 uh i don't know that
sw3928A-ms98-a-0006 21.629375 34.939500 personally i would you know i i've started a new job um about a year and a half ago and of course had to go through the physical and the test and you know didn't have any problem with it now one thing i've never experienced is being
sw3928A-ms98-a-0007 34.939500 37.229375 randomly tested and while i
sw3928A-ms98-a-0008 37.229375 47.018625 you know don't have a problem personally with it as far as passing the test i don't know that i would relish being you know pulled out and said hey you know
sw3928A-ms98-a-0009 47.018625 53.818375 roll up your sleeve or or go use this jar but uh i think that there's some companies that do that
sw3928A-ms98-a-0010 53.818375 62.071375 [silence]
sw3928A-ms98-a-0011 62.071375 63.145125 yeah
sw3928A-ms98-a-0012 63.145125 64.705000 [silence]
sw3928A-ms98-a-0013 64.705000 66.095250 yeah that's
sw3928A-ms98-a-0014 66.095250 67.675750 [silence]
sw3928A-ms98-a-0015 67.675750 72.466750 that is a good point i don't want a uh uh pilot hangover
sw3928A-ms98-a-0016 72.466750 74.076375 [laughter]
sw3928A-ms98-a-0017 74.076375 75.990875 yeah right
sw3928A-ms98-a-0018 75.990875 76.997375 yeah
sw3928A-ms98-a-0019 76.997375 78.074000 yeah
sw3928A-ms98-a-0020 78.074000 105.540375 [silence]
sw3928A-ms98-a-0021 105.540375 110.654750 yeah i have a friend of mine who works uh for a company in Atlanta
sw3928A-ms98-a-0022 110.654750 123.329875 [noise] and uh they you know made it clear about you know policy that they were going to start the drug testing and then you know advertised it about oh four or five months he said even before they ever started
sw3928A-ms98-a-0023 123.329875 134.527125 and uh he said one of his bosses was saying that you know should someone test positive that didn't necessarily mean that they would be fired and my friend said well they ought to fire him and he said well perhaps that's you know
sw3928A-ms98-a-0024 134.527125 143.920000 this boss well maybe that might be a little harsh and he said no i'm not [laughter-talking] about firing him for doing the drugs i'm talking about firing him because_1 he's so stupid that they would continue to do it [laughter-a[nd]-]
sw3928A-ms98-a-0025 143.920000 150.493000 with that much adva[nce]- exactly with that much advance notice you know if they are that dumb they ought to get rid of them_1 [laughter] so
sw3928A-ms98-a-0026 150.493000 153.451375 i kind of liked his uh line of thinking 
sw3928A-ms98-a-0027 153.451375 158.068250 [silence]
sw3928A-ms98-a-0028 158.068250 164.200625 yeah i don't know it's it's something that that uh i don't know i think that the uh
sw3928A-ms98-a-0029 164.200625 165.324750 [silence]
sw3928A-ms98-a-0030 165.324750 177.455750 and and maybe i'm optimistic but i think to a great extent uh uh some of the uh casual use of uh the baby boomers
sw3928A-ms98-a-0031 177.455750 189.963000 back uh you know in the seventies and the eighties perhaps is moderating now certainly that doesn't mean that there's not still a severe problem and especially with crack cocaine which i think is just
sw3928A-ms98-a-0032 189.963000 193.595750 a scourge on society uh
sw3928A-ms98-a-0033 193.595750 200.706125 but uh perhaps the recreational use might be declining a little bit and i hope it is
sw3928A-ms98-a-0034 200.706125 210.016375 [silence]
sw3928A-ms98-a-0035 210.016375 211.466125 oh yeah yeah

sw3928A-ms98-a-0038 215.813125 219.347625 awesome to think of anyone raising children to me right now but
sw3928A-ms98-a-0039 219.347625 219.927500 um
sw3928A-ms98-a-0040 219.927500 231.695250 [silence]

sw3928A-ms98-a-0043 234.366375 238.839750 yeah and at the same time i mean i [noise] uh if uh
sw3928A-ms98-a-0044 238.839750 239.894875 [silence]
sw3928A-ms98-a-0045 239.894875 243.071500 with the cost of health care and uh
sw3928A-ms98-a-0046 243.071500 245.656000 [silence]
sw3928A-ms98-a-0047 245.656000 258.457875 just all the additional uh expenses of of recruiting employees like i say i can understand uh the necessity of being tested and again that's only only happened to me one time but uh i didn't
sw3928A-ms98-a-0048 258.457875 265.110125 i didn't feel badly about it at all i was more than happy to uh uh submit to the test
sw3928A-ms98-a-0049 265.110125 280.858375 [silence]
sw3928A-ms98-a-0050 280.858375 284.627750 yeah right or certainly not working up to their full potential
sw3928A-ms98-a-0051 284.627750 295.111125 yeah [laughter] but um [noise] well i don't know it's we're in such a perfect harmony on this topic [laughter]
