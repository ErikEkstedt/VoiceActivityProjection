sw3941A-ms98-a-0003 1.302625 5.277750 you think health benefits probably the the most important
sw3941A-ms98-a-0004 5.277750 12.414500 [silence]
sw3941A-ms98-a-0005 12.414500 14.451250 that's true that
sw3941A-ms98-a-0006 14.451250 21.772000 that that's the case or the problem i have i'm getting older and uh the wife and uh we
sw3941A-ms98-a-0007 21.772000 28.796125 use the doctors more have um more health problems and that is a very important benefit that uh
sw3941A-ms98-a-0008 28.796125 29.494500 what
sw3941A-ms98-a-0009 29.494500 32.719000 [silence]

sw3941A-ms98-a-0012 44.967750 51.028875 no i've i haven't really studied that too much but uh that is one of the benefits that uh
sw3941A-ms98-a-0013 51.028875 58.330750 [noise] that i feel that uh is real good
sw3941A-ms98-a-0014 58.330750 60.717250 with uh the company i work for so far but uh it it's uh 
sw3941A-ms98-a-0015 60.717250 70.966625 you know what's gonna happen their costs keep going up as you say and it's uh it could wipe a a family out or uh all your savings and everything one one serious illness
sw3941A-ms98-a-0016 70.966625 81.744125 i think that's uh one of the benefits that we really need to our companies n[eed]- really need to take a look at because_1 there's so many Americans that are not covered at all that's uh
sw3941A-ms98-a-0017 81.744125 91.457875 quite a situation i think the other thing uh security and that that's getting pretty tough now a a a job with security
sw3941A-ms98-a-0018 91.457875 101.148375 uh especially if you're in uh department of defense or you're in the auto industry been working for fifteen or twenty years and all of a sudden uh
sw3941A-ms98-a-0019 101.148375 104.803000 because of changes in Europe this uh
sw3941A-ms98-a-0020 104.803000 105.988250 [silence]
sw3941A-ms98-a-0021 105.988250 118.268250 ho[lidays]- holidays so many people are losing their jobs and uh i don't know how you can a[s]- as a benefit how you could h[ave]- have security as one but most people like to have that security in their jobs
sw3941A-ms98-a-0022 118.268250 123.895125 [silence]
sw3941A-ms98-a-0023 123.895125 125.363375 um-hum
sw3941A-ms98-a-0024 125.363375 133.767125 i'll say yeah it really is and uh it's uh you really feel sorry for those who don't have it or they have a
sw3941A-ms98-a-0025 133.767125 141.545875 uh cancer or something real serious that uh could runs up their uh tran[splant]- heart transplant or something runs up into
sw3941A-ms98-a-0026 141.545875 144.921750 uh um [noise] hundreds of thousands of dollars
sw3941A-ms98-a-0027 144.921750 147.371875 that could wipe you out in a hurry
sw3941A-ms98-a-0028 147.371875 154.292125 [silence]
sw3941A-ms98-a-0029 154.292125 162.758875 good good good a good thing that uh they she had those i think there's other uh
sw3941A-ms98-a-0030 162.758875 172.001250 well there's other benefits that uh kind of or look at i guess uh need a vacation once in a while most jobs do that
sw3941A-ms98-a-0031 172.001250 176.073500 uh give you some time off and uh that's something that uh
sw3941A-ms98-a-0032 176.073500 182.814750 each company's a little different on that but most of them_1 are pretty good on those uh those type of benefits i think
sw3941A-ms98-a-0033 182.814750 186.173875 [silence]
sw3941A-ms98-a-0034 186.173875 194.766250 no there isn't and another one i think is uh quite important of course is retirement system that they they have
sw3941A-ms98-a-0035 194.766250 202.804375 and uh with social security and uh the way it is if that's all you got is social security by the[n]-
sw3941A-ms98-a-0036 202.804375 215.446500 right by the time i get up there uh in a few years and uh draw social security with the cost of living uh that benefit is just really not gonna help very much

sw3941A-ms98-a-0047 241.880375 251.982000 that's true and uh it seems like it goes up every year you have no control over the the cost to you and that just takes away your buying power also and uh
sw3941A-ms98-a-0048 251.982000 261.358000 the company of course i can see the company's side uh too because uh they have to pay uh an a proportion of whatever the
sw3941A-ms98-a-0049 261.358000 268.466750 the health cost is and it gets to the point where uh they're not uh making money and uh
sw3941A-ms98-a-0050 268.466750 270.287875 it uh
sw3941A-ms98-a-0051 270.287875 275.798000 i don't wanna see us to go socialized medicine like they are in England or places like that
sw3941A-ms98-a-0052 275.798000 285.569000 but still uh i- i hope that this plan that uh the President's come up with uh is gonna help all those or help some way
sw3941A-ms98-a-0053 285.569000 288.543125 bottom line though who's gonna pay for it [laughter]

sw3941A-ms98-a-0055 290.989125 294.563750 no no he he just uh proposed it and uh
sw3941A-ms98-a-0056 294.563750 299.458000 the republicans are saying hey it's a great plan the democrats say it's no good so
