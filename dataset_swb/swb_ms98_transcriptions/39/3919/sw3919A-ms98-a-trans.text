sw3919A-ms98-a-0003 3.539125 16.076500 you know i was i was thinking about that while i was waiting for the connection i i think uh you know it's uh uh a military threat certainly i don't feel like it's like it was back in the the sixties whenever Kruschev said he was going to bury us 
sw3919A-ms98-a-0004 16.076500 25.973875 uh at the same time i i think they may still be a threat in a different sort of a way in that uh the situation over there is so unstable
sw3919A-ms98-a-0005 25.973875 37.824375 and and the especially the economics uh uh ramifications of whatever is going to happen over there i mean they're like a a quarter of the land mass of the earth
sw3919A-ms98-a-0006 37.824375 44.535875 you know and and if things don't get straightened out over there it it will impact us one way or the other i think

sw3919A-ms98-a-0015 74.815750 85.822625 well it's uh i don't know it's it's amazing to see uh the kind of changes that's happened just in the past uh you know not even ten years or even five years it's just awesome
sw3919A-ms98-a-0016 85.822625 94.818500 [silence]
sw3919A-ms98-a-0017 94.818500 96.033375 yeah

sw3919A-ms98-a-0020 101.138875 107.570250 yeah but even so he seems to be a much more reasonable person than than you know previous Soviet leaders
sw3919A-ms98-a-0021 107.570250 108.597125 and uh
sw3919A-ms98-a-0022 108.597125 117.648875 [noise] you know it's just uh uh you see this the uh you know on television the the uh shows uh on the news with the the people waiting in line
sw3919A-ms98-a-0023 117.648875 124.381875 they had last night i think it was on ABC where some Soviet doctors had gone on strike because their uh
sw3919A-ms98-a-0024 124.381875 132.635000 monthly salary was about enough money to buy them_1 six pounds of sausage with you know the new increase in prices
sw3919A-ms98-a-0025 132.635000 138.798625 which is you know of course doctors over there aren't held in the same rare high esteem that they have here in the US
sw3919A-ms98-a-0026 138.798625 139.813625 but

sw3919A-ms98-a-0041 222.396500 233.016000 it's good for us to look after our own best interests even in uh you know an international way but at the same time w[e]- i don't think that we have the resources to bale out the entire Soviet Union
sw3919A-ms98-a-0042 233.016000 240.873500 [silence]
sw3919A-ms98-a-0043 240.873500 241.969125 yeah

sw3919A-ms98-a-0045 251.334875 257.665500 you know the amazing thing ab[out]- about it is how these people who've been operating for you know seventy generations under a uh uh
sw3919A-ms98-a-0046 257.665500 265.080000 you know the the p[rotectorate]- protectorate of the the government over them that they really don't even have a concept of what capitalism is
sw3919A-ms98-a-0047 265.080000 275.102375 a[nd]- and and as a matter of fact i'm not a guy with my company was in Moscow several weeks ago and i asked him what it was like and he said you know he said they start drinking vodka at ten o'clock in the morning
sw3919A-ms98-a-0048 275.102375 277.879500 [laughter]

sw3919A-ms98-a-0052 282.274250 285.954375 but uh anyway it's uh uh i don't know there there just
sw3919A-ms98-a-0053 285.954375 299.458000 they've got a really uh different outlook and a different mentality than uh uh people than have anybody that has been accustomed to living uh under any form of capitalism and it's going to take quite a while for them to to realize that uh
