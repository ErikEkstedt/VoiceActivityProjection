sw3905B-ms98-a-0002 1.838625 4.286250 what product did you have returned
sw3905B-ms98-a-0003 4.286250 31.243750 [silence]
sw3905B-ms98-a-0004 31.243750 39.578375 well i'm kind of confused about American made products because Ford and Chevy have Isuzu Mazda engines
sw3905B-ms98-a-0005 39.578375 43.756125 and they're considered American products
sw3905B-ms98-a-0006 43.756125 52.201750 so i don't understand if we are supposed to not buy Volvos and Volkswagons and Mazdas because they are foreign
sw3905B-ms98-a-0007 52.201750 59.234750 or if we are supposed to buy American because they're foreign but they are American cars you know what i am saying
sw3905B-ms98-a-0008 59.234750 61.429625 and i just don't understand that
sw3905B-ms98-a-0009 61.429625 65.617125 and it seems that whenever you do have a product
sw3905B-ms98-a-0010 65.617125 71.929875 parts of it are both American and overseas that it creates a problem
sw3905B-ms98-a-0011 71.929875 76.008750 both in uh the product
sw3905B-ms98-a-0012 76.008750 78.165750 and in the
sw3905B-ms98-a-0013 78.165750 82.723000 overall warranty or lasting
sw3905B-ms98-a-0014 82.723000 85.195500 [silence]
sw3905B-ms98-a-0015 85.195500 86.204625 yes i did

sw3905B-ms98-a-0017 87.436750 91.429625 i bought a Chrysler New Yorker and my daughter bought a Plymouth Sundance
sw3905B-ms98-a-0018 91.429625 94.247250 [silence]
sw3905B-ms98-a-0019 94.247250 102.423250 no uh i was surprised yes Chrysler has some of their parts built overseas also
sw3905B-ms98-a-0020 102.423250 105.438625 and i thought that was totally American
sw3905B-ms98-a-0021 105.438625 106.531500 [silence]
sw3905B-ms98-a-0022 106.531500 113.222375 and uh that's why i stayed away from General Motors and find out that the same thing happened to me anyway
sw3905B-ms98-a-0023 113.222375 127.855875 [silence]
sw3905B-ms98-a-0024 127.855875 130.386125 and engines that's true
sw3905B-ms98-a-0025 130.386125 136.841875 it seems like they're quote unquote American made where was your VCR 
sw3905B-ms98-a-0026 136.841875 140.016000 [silence]

sw3905B-ms98-a-0032 183.020625 193.074250 is a Japanese computer company and they deliberately make boards and parts wrong so you will have to buy them
sw3905B-ms98-a-0033 193.074250 198.388750 and it cannot be repaired and that upset me when i found that out
sw3905B-ms98-a-0034 198.388750 199.440625 [silence]
sw3905B-ms98-a-0035 199.440625 208.004750 no i don't but my daughter does and she worked with a computer company that uh serviced them
sw3905B-ms98-a-0036 208.004750 214.721125 and she is the one that told me about that because uh we were we are thinking about buying a computer we haven't done it yet
sw3905B-ms98-a-0037 214.721125 224.856500 and uh since she works for this compu[ter]- computer company i asked her what she thought was best cause if TI was using Macs and IBM clones and this type of thing
sw3905B-ms98-a-0038 224.856500 226.887625 [noise] and uh
sw3905B-ms98-a-0039 226.887625 235.783000 she was saying that she didn't know which one was the best because of the way they're put together and then she was telling me about this uh
sw3905B-ms98-a-0040 235.783000 237.560750 uh com[puter]-
sw3905B-ms98-a-0041 237.560750 242.223625 [vocalized-noise] boards just put in X number of uh
sw3905B-ms98-a-0042 242.223625 252.421500 computers and then they last for eighteen months to no longer than two years and then instead of repairing them you have to buy a whole new board
sw3905B-ms98-a-0043 252.421500 263.329750 [silence]
