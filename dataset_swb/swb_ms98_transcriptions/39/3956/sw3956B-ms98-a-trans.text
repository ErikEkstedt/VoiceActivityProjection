sw3956B-ms98-a-0003 32.072625 36.064125 good grief that's just almost unaffordable isn't it
sw3956B-ms98-a-0004 36.064125 47.444750 [silence]
sw3956B-ms98-a-0005 47.444750 56.556875 well i wonder if they couldn't just provide uh interim health insurance for people who are between jobs like that that might be a step in the right direction i don't know
sw3956B-ms98-a-0006 56.556875 59.014750 [silence]
sw3956B-ms98-a-0007 59.014750 60.625750 uh-huh

sw3956B-ms98-a-0011 74.480250 78.904375 [silence]
sw3956B-ms98-a-0012 78.904375 81.289500 because_1 everybody's competing for jobs

sw3956B-ms98-a-0014 82.888250 89.459250 [silence]
sw3956B-ms98-a-0015 89.459250 99.433250 well i used to think that universal health insurance was probably the right thing to do i I have to think about it some more now because my doctor is uh actually he's Canadian
sw3956B-ms98-a-0016 99.433250 111.787000 and uh he told me that there're a lot of uh lot of counts against the Canadian system which is basically the one people are talking about for here i don't understand the arguments exactly he says it restricts your choice
sw3956B-ms98-a-0017 111.787000 120.696000 of doctors and and so forth i'm not quite sure i understand why government health insurance would restrict your choice any more than private insurance does
sw3956B-ms98-a-0018 120.696000 129.993500 i mean we're on a private insurance plan right now uh actually uh i have my own business and and we uh our health insurance is through my wife's employer
sw3956B-ms98-a-0019 129.993500 137.276125 and uh and every year we get another list of what doctor's we can go to and where we can buy or medicine and
sw3956B-ms98-a-0020 137.276125 142.848625 and uh it changes every [laughter-year] it's always so confusing so uh
sw3956B-ms98-a-0021 142.848625 149.418125 [silence]
sw3956B-ms98-a-0022 149.418125 150.874875 um-hum
sw3956B-ms98-a-0023 150.874875 154.919500 [silence]
sw3956B-ms98-a-0024 154.919500 156.082500 well yeah
sw3956B-ms98-a-0025 156.082500 158.353625 [silence]
sw3956B-ms98-a-0026 158.353625 170.659125 of course the restricted choice in this case is because only certain doctors agree to accept the uh the limits of uh compensation but of course that is restricted choice so
sw3956B-ms98-a-0027 170.659125 174.842000 i don't think that the restricted choice really uh
sw3956B-ms98-a-0028 174.842000 186.453375 has to do with the difference between uh public and private health insurance i think it has to do with the the the uh attempt to limit cost doesn't it and uh everybody agrees that we need to limit cost some way so
sw3956B-ms98-a-0029 186.453375 187.495750 [silence]
sw3956B-ms98-a-0030 187.495750 196.029750 well um i guess the most sensible thing i've heard about this is they they say people are trying you you you have to recognize that if you're going to
sw3956B-ms98-a-0031 196.029750 204.593500 have the very best health care possible and uh available on demand whenever and wherever you want it then it's gonna be expensive
sw3956B-ms98-a-0032 204.593500 210.862625 and if you wanna pay less then you're gonna have to settle for a health system that is not quite that uh lavish
sw3956B-ms98-a-0033 210.862625 212.381875 and uh
sw3956B-ms98-a-0034 212.381875 217.726000 [silence]
