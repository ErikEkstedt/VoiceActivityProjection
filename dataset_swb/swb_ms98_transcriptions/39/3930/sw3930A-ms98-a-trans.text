sw3930A-ms98-a-0003 2.257875 4.457750 hello yeah

sw3930A-ms98-a-0005 8.304125 9.344000 [silence]
sw3930A-ms98-a-0006 9.344000 11.871750 we do have the death penalty for murder
sw3930A-ms98-a-0007 11.871750 13.253875 and uh 
sw3930A-ms98-a-0008 13.253875 14.589750 the
sw3930A-ms98-a-0009 14.589750 16.181375 uh 
sw3930A-ms98-a-0010 16.181375 22.727625 th[e]- either the jury or the judge can make that determination depending on the crime the seriousness of the crime
sw3930A-ms98-a-0011 22.727625 26.468625 it's been uh uh
sw3930A-ms98-a-0012 26.468625 36.203625 it's been uh oh it's been four or five years ago since uh someone was actually uh put on death row well there's some quite a few on death row but uh before one was executed
sw3930A-ms98-a-0013 36.203625 37.510750 [silence]
sw3930A-ms98-a-0014 37.510750 43.254375 and it uh we've got some that uh have been there for ten or fifteen years and
sw3930A-ms98-a-0015 43.254375 48.354250 i don't know my opinion on on uh the death penalty i think it's uh
sw3930A-ms98-a-0016 48.354250 55.379875 personally i think it would be a deterrent if uh they were able to carry this out without many appeals
sw3930A-ms98-a-0017 55.379875 59.955500 but they appeal and appeal and uh it just goes on forever but
sw3930A-ms98-a-0018 59.955500 62.357500 [silence]
sw3930A-ms98-a-0019 62.357500 70.624500 uh-huh it really does and uh uh i i have i've always felt that uh 
sw3930A-ms98-a-0020 70.624500 76.941125 if they murder someone in cold uh in cold blood they know what they're doing and uh
sw3930A-ms98-a-0021 76.941125 79.471875 that they should be uh
sw3930A-ms98-a-0022 79.471875 85.674750 pay made to pay for it but if we don't have a deterrent of some kind then it just gets to the point where
sw3930A-ms98-a-0023 85.674750 91.852250 and if people it's just if they want to do it they do it and then they they think well i'll be out in uh
sw3930A-ms98-a-0024 91.852250 94.900750 two or three years and a lot of them are
sw3930A-ms98-a-0025 94.900750 96.112750 [silence]
sw3930A-ms98-a-0026 96.112750 98.112000 uh-huh right
sw3930A-ms98-a-0027 98.112000 106.203875 [silence]
sw3930A-ms98-a-0028 106.203875 107.721250 uh-huh
sw3930A-ms98-a-0029 107.721250 109.305500 right
sw3930A-ms98-a-0030 109.305500 111.384625 what if the
sw3930A-ms98-a-0031 111.384625 123.667375 [noise] where it's so clear cut we've had a couple cases here where they were actually caught and they uh and they had witnesses where they had killed two or three people
sw3930A-ms98-a-0032 123.667375 128.961750 and there was one that they thought they'd killed but they hadn't and they had the witness and
sw3930A-ms98-a-0033 128.961750 133.258125 and uh they did all kinds of things to these poor people
sw3930A-ms98-a-0034 133.258125 145.416875 and this one they thought they had killed him but uh they hadn't and the the police were able to get them but they they did uh were able to uh have the one uh
sw3930A-ms98-a-0035 145.416875 150.002125 executed but the other one is still appealing and uh
sw3930A-ms98-a-0036 150.002125 151.719375 it's uh
sw3930A-ms98-a-0037 151.719375 156.587875 it's really a sad thing especially for the families of those that were involved
sw3930A-ms98-a-0038 156.587875 162.216125 [silence]
sw3930A-ms98-a-0039 162.216125 163.851875 uh-huh
sw3930A-ms98-a-0040 163.851875 175.474125 right and and they don't have the crime rate that we have here i know my son uh was over in Saudi Arabia but he was over there during the war and he said man somebody over there
sw3930A-ms98-a-0041 175.474125 182.628500 uh they they kill someone and the and uh that's it they're killed or they
sw3930A-ms98-a-0042 182.628500 191.634500 right and so he says you really don't have that he could see the crime rate was very low over there because people knew the consequences
sw3930A-ms98-a-0043 191.634500 195.984000 but here it's got to the point where i think it's gone too far the other way
sw3930A-ms98-a-0044 195.984000 205.246625 [silence]
sw3930A-ms98-a-0045 205.246625 206.360250 uh
sw3930A-ms98-a-0046 206.360250 207.776250 that's true
sw3930A-ms98-a-0047 207.776250 212.011500 [silence]
sw3930A-ms98-a-0048 212.011500 222.535250 well i know made in the point you made about the taxpayer paying for it when you start considering the cost of fifty to sixty thousand dollars a year to keep them in prison
sw3930A-ms98-a-0049 222.535250 228.792750 plus all the attorney costs [noise] all of that the taxpayers pay for
sw3930A-ms98-a-0050 228.792750 238.965000 and uh the victims they don't get anything other than just the heartache and going through this and going through it appeal after appeal and i don't know i
sw3930A-ms98-a-0051 238.965000 242.542125 [silence]
sw3930A-ms98-a-0052 242.542125 250.558750 uh-huh and then they find some little glitch uh in the law and uh you either turn them loose or
sw3930A-ms98-a-0053 250.558750 255.356250 or put them in prison for life and then maybe after a few years they're paroled
sw3930A-ms98-a-0054 255.356250 256.396500 [silence]
sw3930A-ms98-a-0055 256.396500 261.454000 so i don't know it's it's uh quite a situation i [noise]
sw3930A-ms98-a-0056 261.454000 271.260250 [noise] i wish they'd get back to that but uh every once in a while there was a fellow that was executed in uh Wyoming the state next to us
sw3930A-ms98-a-0057 271.260250 284.222875 uh about a month ago and uh of course he he said he wanted to be because he he had done the you know he he admitted to it and everything he said i just don't want to stay in prison and 
sw3930A-ms98-a-0058 284.222875 291.169500 so the lawyers couldn't do anything to stop that one [laughter] but anyway it's uh
sw3930A-ms98-a-0059 291.169500 292.441750 i
sw3930A-ms98-a-0060 292.441750 294.986125 [silence]
sw3930A-ms98-a-0061 294.986125 300.066000 well it does and then you try to teach your children uh respect for for uh
