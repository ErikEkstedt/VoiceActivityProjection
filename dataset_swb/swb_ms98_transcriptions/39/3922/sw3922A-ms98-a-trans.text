sw3922A-ms98-a-0038 162.766125 173.858875 you know uh i mean he wears wool in the summer but it's a lighter weight and it it it is uh a lot thinner so it breathes better than a a polyester would
sw3922A-ms98-a-0039 173.858875 180.190375 the wool does and and i wear suits occasionally at work at but a lot of it depends on
sw3922A-ms98-a-0040 180.190375 185.144750 wh[at]- what i've got going like if i've if i'm gonna be meeting with customers

sw3922A-ms98-a-0042 196.141875 202.926000 i don't um you know dress up as much and it it depends on what kind of meetings i have
sw3922A-ms98-a-0043 202.926000 210.337000 but um fortunately TI is flexible enough that um you know i can do that

sw3922A-ms98-a-0053 268.934750 275.812500 so i do that even at work it's more it if i do wear jeans that might be the day that i wear them_1
