sw3981B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.108750 [noise]
sw3981B-ms98-a-0002 0.108750 2.826250 so you uh exercise on a regular basis
sw3981B-ms98-a-0003 2.826250 10.760000 [laughter]
sw3981B-ms98-a-0004 10.760000 12.500000 uh-huh what kind of exercise do you do
sw3981B-ms98-a-0005 12.500000 16.999625 [silence]
sw3981B-ms98-a-0006 16.999625 18.379000 um-hum
sw3981B-ms98-a-0007 18.379000 21.220000 [silence]
sw3981B-ms98-a-0008 21.220000 22.122750 um-hum
sw3981B-ms98-a-0009 22.122750 24.191625 [silence]
sw3981B-ms98-a-0010 24.191625 26.452250 oh that's not bad um-hum
sw3981B-ms98-a-0011 26.452250 39.329250 well i uh i like to run but uh i have problems with my back hurting so uh i run i if i run it's usually short durations and i only do it when i can't you know get out of the house um
sw3981B-ms98-a-0012 39.329250 51.401000 there you know to go because_1 i usually work out in a health club and uh i try to work out like every other day and sometimes when it's like a really nice day outside i don't feel like going [laughter-inside] to work out then i go ahead and run for short duration
sw3981B-ms98-a-0013 51.401000 52.927750 [silence]
sw3981B-ms98-a-0014 52.927750 56.314250 yeah i use i like to do uh free weights
sw3981B-ms98-a-0015 56.314250 70.357875 because_1 uh i found certain parts of my [laughter-body] developed better than other parts of my body so uh instead of they you know they have like different circuits and they tell you to work every single muscle in your body and uh i hate working a muscle that you know just won't develop [laughter]
sw3981B-ms98-a-0016 70.357875 82.231625 so uh i've i've gotten uh i've adapted to uh a routine and i like to work my arms and my chest and my stomach and everything else just seems to stay the same no matter [laughter-what] i do to it
sw3981B-ms98-a-0017 82.231625 93.103000 so those are what i like to work out the most and you know i get a pretty decent workout with my legs um just you know on occasion running but or you know just running around what i do everyday so
sw3981B-ms98-a-0018 93.103000 98.975750 [silence]
sw3981B-ms98-a-0019 98.975750 111.565125 well so[metimes]- what happens is sometimes uh now different machines i guess uh work different ways but uh the way i look at it if sometimes the machine like you know one hand can put more [porce/force] can put more force than the other one
sw3981B-ms98-a-0020 111.565125 117.057250 so sometimes you end up working out one hand more than the other or one leg more than the other because the machine averages the weights out
sw3981B-ms98-a-0021 117.057250 122.181875 because_1 you're pulling like the same set of weights out now they they have different machines that will uh
sw3981B-ms98-a-0022 122.181875 123.469500 um
sw3981B-ms98-a-0023 123.469500 134.461250 right they have what they have like a uh we[ight]- weight for one side and a weight for the other side and that's you know better than uh than like a universal set usually has like one set of weights that you know you do for both of them
sw3981B-ms98-a-0024 134.461250 135.413375 um
sw3981B-ms98-a-0025 135.413375 142.153250 but even then uh i i'd like to think the free weights [laughter-simulate] a live a real world situation better
sw3981B-ms98-a-0026 142.153250 151.691375 you know like uh just like a friend of mine used to tell me he goes uh if you work out with free weights you know and a car falls on you think the free weights going to give you better uh
sw3981B-ms98-a-0027 151.691375 158.166000 better [laughter-idea] of what's gonna happen rather than if you work out with uh you know with some kind of machine 
sw3981B-ms98-a-0028 158.166000 167.512250 but uh the machines the one thing the machines do do that the free weights don't do is they focus on a specific muscle or muscle group
sw3981B-ms98-a-0029 167.512250 179.993750 which is something i don't think you will get out of the free weights because_1 the free weights just kind of work your whole body i guess or a whole area as opposed to like one spot because_1 if you get like a particular Nautilus machine or something
sw3981B-ms98-a-0030 179.993750 183.799625 ye[ah]- you can get it like down to you know the very last muscle down there
sw3981B-ms98-a-0031 183.799625 185.969875 so it works pretty good
sw3981B-ms98-a-0032 185.969875 191.758625 [silence]
sw3981B-ms98-a-0033 191.758625 192.951750 um that
sw3981B-ms98-a-0034 192.951750 195.515125 [silence]
sw3981B-ms98-a-0035 195.515125 197.449250 i'm sorry say that one more time
sw3981B-ms98-a-0036 197.449250 199.501375 [silence]
sw3981B-ms98-a-0037 199.501375 205.814250 oh no usually what i do is when i get to the uh i- i usually like run around the track they have a track there
sw3981B-ms98-a-0038 205.814250 217.383875 i run around the track uh you know uh maybe like it's a tenth of a mile all the way around so i just run real slow you know maybe do a couple of laps just enough to get my heart rate going
sw3981B-ms98-a-0039 217.383875 224.075750 and uh after that then i just go ahead and just get in my routine i do uh i do my um my sit ups first
sw3981B-ms98-a-0040 224.075750 232.975000 and that also uh that gets my heart rate going too and then i- i don't pump iron until maybe like halfway through and then i sit down and start doing the the free weights
sw3981B-ms98-a-0041 232.975000 237.476625 and then i usually run before i leave to kind of relax me a little bit
sw3981B-ms98-a-0042 237.476625 251.864375 yeah so i[t]- it works out okay i haven't uh i the problem is you know i get into it and i work out for three months four months in a row get in great shape and then you know i'll have a business conference i usually go overseas twice or three times a year
sw3981B-ms98-a-0043 251.864375 263.124375 and to attend these conferences and they kill me [laughter] you you travel you eat a lot you um [noise] it messes up you know your uh biological clock you know
sw3981B-ms98-a-0044 263.124375 269.783125 and uh it just screws you up completely [laughter] and by the time you come back you don't feel like working out you [laughter-know]
sw3981B-ms98-a-0045 269.783125 273.046000 [silence]
sw3981B-ms98-a-0046 273.046000 274.381875 well uh
sw3981B-ms98-a-0047 274.381875 277.546250 i y[ou]- you don't lose strength i don't think you lose a little bit of tone
sw3981B-ms98-a-0048 277.546250 281.440375 um but you get back into it and you know it doesn't take very long to build it back up
sw3981B-ms98-a-0049 281.440375 290.861250 but uh i don't think you know they say you get flabby if you you know the more you work out and you get all big muscles and stuff and then also when you stop they say you get flabby when you get older you know
sw3981B-ms98-a-0050 290.861250 298.850000 well it may happen but like i said it's easy to develop them_1 because if i lose if i lose tone you know by not working out uh over a period of a week or two
