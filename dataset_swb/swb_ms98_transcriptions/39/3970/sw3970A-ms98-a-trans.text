sw3970A-ms98-a-0046 215.920875 220.103250 well i that's it i've been working for uh
sw3970A-ms98-a-0047 220.103250 227.320375 oh thirty five years for the the government and think i've got a pretty good job but i don't make that much
sw3970A-ms98-a-0048 227.320375 230.242250 and i've got uh
sw3970A-ms98-a-0049 230.242250 241.210500 a a degree and everything [laughter-else] you see and i and i don't know hopefully you you'd think that if they were making that kind of money they would try to have a little pride in
sw3970A-ms98-a-0050 241.210500 246.215875 in uh the product that they put out so it is a good car but
sw3970A-ms98-a-0051 246.215875 258.062375 uh my family's bought uh my sister bought uh a a Buick paid twenty thousand dollars for it she's had nothing but trouble with that thing
sw3970A-ms98-a-0052 258.062375 265.558750 and you know you pay that kind of money you should uh it should be trouble free at least for fif[ty]- fifty seventy thousand and then
sw3970A-ms98-a-0053 265.558750 275.965000 and uh she's had it in the in the sh[op]- garage and shop and she called today and said oh it's uh leaking oil out of the head gasket she's only got about twenty thousand on it
sw3970A-ms98-a-0054 275.965000 286.507375 so she's got to take that back in and have them_1 work on it but and i and i think it from what i can hear it's just because they uh
sw3970A-ms98-a-0055 286.507375 299.394000 they don't take the pride that uh the Japanese do or something in in their work or workmanship that when something comes out and their name's on it they want it to to be the best and so i i hate to stay away from Ameri[can]-
