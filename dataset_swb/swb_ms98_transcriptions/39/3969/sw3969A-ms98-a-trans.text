sw3969A-ms98-a-0025 88.333000 92.935000 i think country music i don't like the real old twangy stuff like the 
sw3969A-ms98-a-0026 92.935000 101.997125 you know but th[at]- it has under[gone]- undergone a lot of change and there's a like there's a guy named Lyle Lovett that he could be considered
sw3969A-ms98-a-0027 101.997125 103.809750 [silence]
sw3969A-ms98-a-0028 103.809750 105.340875 but

sw3969A-ms98-a-0030 106.920750 110.772375 yeah see he doe[s]- it's more what do they call it
sw3969A-ms98-a-0031 110.772375 122.947375 sometimes i've heard it called Rockabilly where it's like rock and roll and or country but um but they refer to him you know as a country singer but a lot of his stuff sounds really jazzy
sw3969A-ms98-a-0032 122.947375 126.678500 [silence]
sw3969A-ms98-a-0033 126.678500 140.699500 um they i mean they they term him as that but i i know well i've watched like the music awards or the country music awards before and they had him on as a new up and coming country singer
sw3969A-ms98-a-0034 140.699500 145.226375 so it's kind of i mean but there's a lot of people kind of like that that
sw3969A-ms98-a-0035 145.226375 150.171500 they're they're play[ing]- they're right on the line and you know the
sw3969A-ms98-a-0036 150.171500 154.504625 at the the i guess the rock and roll side might be so saturated that
sw3969A-ms98-a-0037 154.504625 160.344000 you know they're trying out this and and we've gone country and western dancing [laughter-before] and
sw3969A-ms98-a-0038 160.344000 166.102875 but and it when i don't i don't dance i mean country dance that well but
sw3969A-ms98-a-0039 166.102875 173.124625 you know just watching the people when they get out there is when they start playing the rock and roll music while the band's taking a break
sw3969A-ms98-a-0040 173.124625 177.628000 you [laughter-know] i mean they get out there and jitterbug and or you know whatever you want to call it
sw3969A-ms98-a-0041 177.628000 187.386875 and uh so i think there's there's a lot of people out there now that aren't aren't just Johnny Cash [laughter-fans] [laughter-or] [laughter-or] you know or um
