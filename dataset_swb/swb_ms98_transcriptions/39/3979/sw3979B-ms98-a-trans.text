sw3979B-ms98-a-0007 14.069875 18.376500 uh through Nancy Dalgren she um
sw3979B-ms98-a-0008 18.376500 23.871875 she had somehow gotten the information from TI and was distributing it around
sw3979B-ms98-a-0009 23.871875 32.650250 [silence]
sw3979B-ms98-a-0010 32.650250 36.550750 um see i'm not sure that
sw3979B-ms98-a-0011 36.550750 45.654875 i don't think they're necessarily widespread in this country but i think that the opportunity is definitely there for um
sw3979B-ms98-a-0012 45.654875 51.980375 people to invade your privacy when they want to i think it's um
sw3979B-ms98-a-0013 51.980375 61.770750 well it's certainly not that difficult to tap a phone it's completely trivial to for instance
sw3979B-ms98-a-0014 61.770750 70.806375 listen in on someone's car phone or walk around phone since they're just radio signals [noise] it's um 
sw3979B-ms98-a-0015 70.806375 72.728875 and
sw3979B-ms98-a-0016 72.728875 74.436625 [silence]
sw3979B-ms98-a-0017 74.436625 76.349625 let's see
sw3979B-ms98-a-0018 76.349625 78.226625 [silence]
sw3979B-ms98-a-0019 78.226625 81.281375 well what's the first thing that comes to your mind
sw3979B-ms98-a-0020 81.281375 90.211250 [silence]
sw3979B-ms98-a-0021 90.211250 91.643250 uh-huh
sw3979B-ms98-a-0022 91.643250 120.310500 [silence]
sw3979B-ms98-a-0023 120.310500 124.541375 yeah i agree with you there for sure
sw3979B-ms98-a-0024 124.541375 126.695250 um
sw3979B-ms98-a-0025 126.695250 135.544875 and i think that all that information is quite easy for anyone to get you know it's possible for
sw3979B-ms98-a-0026 135.544875 142.277875 almost anyone to get information about your credit history for instance if they just um
sw3979B-ms98-a-0027 142.277875 149.830500 twist the right arm or claim to be from the right organization when they're calling the credit company
sw3979B-ms98-a-0028 149.830500 154.592125 it's you know possible for a thirteen year old
sw3979B-ms98-a-0029 154.592125 163.797625 hacker with a modem to find out almost anything about your personal history not to mention change it if he wants to
sw3979B-ms98-a-0030 163.797625 165.056875 [silence]
sw3979B-ms98-a-0031 165.056875 166.718000 well um
sw3979B-ms98-a-0032 166.718000 172.682625 well yes well for instance yes um and they'll probably goes into
sw3979B-ms98-a-0033 172.682625 175.904875 other things like you know your records with
sw3979B-ms98-a-0034 175.904875 180.511250 the government or utility companies or anything
sw3979B-ms98-a-0035 180.511250 181.797250 since
sw3979B-ms98-a-0036 181.797250 183.504125 [silence]
sw3979B-ms98-a-0037 183.504125 187.509500 um uh not
sw3979B-ms98-a-0038 187.509500 196.295375 not yet anyways because i don't think they're widespread enough but i think they have the potential of becoming serious problems
sw3979B-ms98-a-0039 196.295375 201.621375 [silence]
sw3979B-ms98-a-0040 201.621375 205.981000 [noise] um i'm not really sure because
sw3979B-ms98-a-0041 205.981000 208.073000 the
sw3979B-ms98-a-0042 208.073000 218.501750 i mean society is going more and more electronic and there are certainly benefits to its doing so
sw3979B-ms98-a-0043 218.501750 230.073375 and it's hard to hard to say whether the um risks have potential of outweighing the benefits or not
sw3979B-ms98-a-0044 230.073375 233.952625 and i'm not sure
sw3979B-ms98-a-0045 233.952625 238.861625 what can be done to ensure that they don't um
sw3979B-ms98-a-0046 238.861625 242.772500 uh why do you see any out for us
sw3979B-ms98-a-0047 242.772500 258.565250 [silence]
