sw3979A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 3.838750 [noise] afternoon Doug it certainly is uh going to be a pleasure to chat with you
sw3979A-ms98-a-0002 3.838750 11.827000 [laughter] and i'm uh certainly was surprised to uh to hear from you normally i talk to people in Plano Texas
sw3979A-ms98-a-0003 11.827000 14.181125 how did you get on this list
sw3979A-ms98-a-0004 14.181125 21.087875 [silence]
sw3979A-ms98-a-0005 21.087875 23.001750 oh okay
sw3979A-ms98-a-0006 23.001750 27.967125 all righty well now what would you say about these everyday
sw3979A-ms98-a-0007 27.967125 33.149250 invasions of our privacy d[o]- what ideas do you have on that Doug
sw3979A-ms98-a-0008 33.149250 50.010375 [silence]
sw3979A-ms98-a-0009 50.010375 52.768125 in what in what manner
sw3979A-ms98-a-0010 52.768125 68.039250 [silence]
sw3979A-ms98-a-0011 68.039250 69.464250 um-hum
sw3979A-ms98-a-0012 69.464250 80.251000 [silence]
sw3979A-ms98-a-0013 80.251000 90.877250 well the thing that i thought they were uh concerned about was was people c[alling]- calling on the phone from all over the country to sell you something
sw3979A-ms98-a-0014 90.877250 99.084875 and in reality in many cases they knew or they had information about you that was purchased from some other
sw3979A-ms98-a-0015 99.084875 105.410000 organizations and i thought that was uh beginning to invade the privacy of people because
sw3979A-ms98-a-0016 105.410000 109.422375 the things about where you live and and maybe what you purchased in
sw3979A-ms98-a-0017 109.422375 118.150250 past months is then put down and sent to someone else in the same business and they in return come back and try to sell you something with this uh
sw3979A-ms98-a-0018 118.150250 121.484375 additional knowledge to me that's an invasion of privacy
sw3979A-ms98-a-0019 121.484375 149.068625 [silence]
sw3979A-ms98-a-0020 149.068625 150.468000 uh-huh
sw3979A-ms98-a-0021 150.468000 162.944125 [silence]
sw3979A-ms98-a-0022 162.944125 168.281250 [noise] you mean your history in regards to uh the charge card company or something like that
sw3979A-ms98-a-0023 168.281250 179.985000 [silence]
sw3979A-ms98-a-0024 179.985000 183.975750 do you consider these serious uh problems
sw3979A-ms98-a-0025 183.975750 197.083625 [silence]
sw3979A-ms98-a-0026 197.083625 203.228125 um-hum well what should we do about it or what could be done about it do you think to correct it
sw3979A-ms98-a-0027 203.228125 242.130500 [silence]
sw3979A-ms98-a-0028 242.130500 254.192625 [noise] well i would think that uh information held on records uh by any company or charge card dealer or or person should be absolutely p[rivate]- private and
sw3979A-ms98-a-0029 254.192625 259.106000 and not be allowed to be uh to given out by those companies
sw3979A-ms98-a-0030 259.106000 271.037500 i mean it it should be made a a uh national or a state law to protect people so that uh you would then feel more free to deal direct with these companies
sw3979A-ms98-a-0031 271.037500 283.570250 in other words if you call the company yourself directly uh and then know that what you tell them will be on their records but will not be available to anyone else uh you know from the outside so to speak then you'd
sw3979A-ms98-a-0032 283.570250 287.845125 you'd feel more free to uh to go into detail with them
sw3979A-ms98-a-0033 287.845125 300.066000 but but we have no control of that now and then uh you you're when you're talking with them you really don't want to tell them everything that's on your mind because you you feel that it someday might be used against you
