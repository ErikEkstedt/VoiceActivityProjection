sw3967A-ms98-a-0010 36.960750 43.446375 we have uh one dog no kids and one dog so um we
sw3967A-ms98-a-0011 43.446375 45.785625 we have a Golden Retriever
sw3967A-ms98-a-0012 45.785625 47.796125 oh really
sw3967A-ms98-a-0013 47.796125 51.530625 yeah she's a mess [laughter]
sw3967A-ms98-a-0014 51.530625 60.102125 [silence]
sw3967A-ms98-a-0015 60.102125 62.062875 wow
sw3967A-ms98-a-0016 62.062875 67.800125 yeah they i mean they go through a a terror a time [laughter]
sw3967A-ms98-a-0017 67.800125 72.409000 um she's let's see i guess she's about eleven months
sw3967A-ms98-a-0018 72.409000 74.011250 so she's
sw3967A-ms98-a-0019 74.011250 75.680125 yeah
sw3967A-ms98-a-0020 75.680125 79.813625 and they say they stay puppies for a couple of years so
sw3967A-ms98-a-0021 79.813625 86.976750 um but she you know we took her through obedience school back when at four four or five months
sw3967A-ms98-a-0022 86.976750 93.300375 and then we had her fixed at around seven months because i couldn't handle her
sw3967A-ms98-a-0023 93.300375 98.650125 yes i was so worried the whole time that you know a dog was going to jump the fence and
sw3967A-ms98-a-0024 98.650125 105.189875 and we decided that we weren't going to breed her and and stuff because there we felt there were enough dogs and
sw3967A-ms98-a-0025 105.189875 107.128750 and uh
sw3967A-ms98-a-0026 107.128750 113.412125 so um we went ahead and had her fixed while she was in [laughter-heat] and um
sw3967A-ms98-a-0027 113.412125 124.863125 but she's she's pretty smart although she you know she gets angry and she's just like a child when she um 
sw3967A-ms98-a-0028 124.863125 128.716250 oh if she's so into what she's doing
sw3967A-ms98-a-0029 128.716250 135.246375 you know she won't listen to you listen to a c[ommand]- listen to a command well like um
sw3967A-ms98-a-0030 135.246375 144.331250 okay i'm trying to think of an example if we're sitting on the couch and she wants to play with you and you say no you know off
sw3967A-ms98-a-0031 144.331250 154.724875 and then she'll she'll come and stick one paw up and then you take her paw and set it off well she starts doing it and she gets frustrated that you're telling her no so it turns into this 
sw3967A-ms98-a-0032 154.724875 163.997875 this uh almost a fight you know it's like you can't tell me [laughter-that] you know so she starts losing her patience and then we lose our patience
sw3967A-ms98-a-0033 163.997875 165.076625 [silence]
sw3967A-ms98-a-0034 165.076625 167.168500 um
sw3967A-ms98-a-0035 167.168500 175.174625 um no she bites a lot but i mean it's sometimes it's it's not angry but sometimes it is
sw3967A-ms98-a-0036 175.174625 176.681250 yeah
sw3967A-ms98-a-0037 176.681250 184.532500 yeah they well she's real mouthy you know and that's one thing i think with being retrievers is um
sw3967A-ms98-a-0038 184.532500 192.794750 you know everything goes into their mouth and and she just wants attention but she gets angry that you're not giving her the attention
sw3967A-ms98-a-0039 192.794750 206.831250 and then when you you know like like she goes and steals things um [noise] oh we have to keep the doors to our bedrooms closed and she'll go in and if she gets in there she'll go in and pick a teddy bear off this little rocking chair
sw3967A-ms98-a-0040 206.831250 215.540000 and she'll bring it in and she'll kind of show it to she'll stand there until you see her and then as soon as you see her she takes off and it's like come get me
sw3967A-ms98-a-0041 215.540000 220.480750 [silence]
sw3967A-ms98-a-0042 220.480750 222.026500 yeah
sw3967A-ms98-a-0043 222.026500 223.991250 [silence]
sw3967A-ms98-a-0044 223.991250 229.984375 yeah i think so and also having other dogs or having other animals
sw3967A-ms98-a-0045 229.984375 241.354625 [silence]
sw3967A-ms98-a-0046 241.354625 246.756875 no i think it's a animal thought too because they do tend to be pack dogs you know
sw3967A-ms98-a-0047 246.756875 252.285000 and they because_1 she loves uh we have a neighbor down the street that has a dog and
sw3967A-ms98-a-0048 252.285000 264.219500 um we there's lots of dogs in our neighborhood but the one down the street she just goes crazy over i mean you'd think that that dog was Elvis or something she just goes hog wild over that dog and
sw3967A-ms98-a-0049 264.219500 271.152625 and um they have a lot of fun together but she doesn't do that with other dogs it's just that one one friend
sw3967A-ms98-a-0050 271.152625 278.233500 [silence]
sw3967A-ms98-a-0051 278.233500 284.010375 but we did get her though because we'd heard that they were good with kids so
sw3967A-ms98-a-0052 284.010375 296.217750 [silence]
sw3967A-ms98-a-0053 296.217750 297.592250 yeah
sw3967A-ms98-a-0054 297.592250 298.754000 [silence]
