sw3935A-ms98-a-0016 67.528375 80.756750 and it has this little um you know sewn on bar on the back of the tie that you tuck it in you know after you've tied it and those little those little some of them_1 bars w[ill]- inevitably come loo[se]- loo[se]- loose
sw3935A-ms98-a-0017 80.756750 94.248750 and it dra[gs]- it just drives me crazy i mean it's an integral part of the tie and it wouldn't take you know what a half a penny of good thread to put it on there securely so um [noise] anyway yeah that's uh that 
sw3935A-ms98-a-0018 94.248750 105.111500 [silence]
sw3935A-ms98-a-0019 105.111500 106.797000 yeah

sw3935A-ms98-a-0023 118.162250 126.643125 yeah i- i will i will tell you my experience with appliances Joan has been that uh [noise] well what happened to me i had a a stereo
sw3935A-ms98-a-0024 126.643125 137.650875 that i uh um r[eceiver]- receiver amplifier that i really liked and it started messing up so i took it to the shop and the minimum charge to even look at it was fifty bucks
sw3935A-ms98-a-0025 137.650875 149.057750 [noise] but i you know rationalized and i thought well even if i spend you know seventy five dollars that's cheaper than buying a new one so i wound up spending the nearly a hundred dollars on it
sw3935A-ms98-a-0026 149.057750 156.687125 took it home it worked maybe two weeks and exactly the same thing happened to it so i took it back to the shop
sw3935A-ms98-a-0027 156.687125 167.824875 and you know bottom line is i went through all this gyration and and aggravation and unhooking it and hooking it back up and hauling it back and forth to the repair shop
sw3935A-ms98-a-0028 167.824875 180.461625 [noise] eventually it never worked right again and i- i wound up buying a new one i had si[milar]- i had a similar thing happen with a television and i'm about i- i just came to the conclusion with electronics anyway
sw3935A-ms98-a-0029 180.461625 184.300000 you know if they break throw them_1 away go get a new it
sw3935A-ms98-a-0030 184.300000 185.499125 [noise]
sw3935A-ms98-a-0031 185.499125 195.641750 yeah you know and and i think you're better off in the long run just to chunk it and get a new one but i- i will have to say you know if you think about things like uh
sw3935A-ms98-a-0032 195.641750 203.467250 as much as stereos for example i can remember the first one i bought whenever i was in college i mean i paid a fortune for it
sw3935A-ms98-a-0033 203.467250 217.039250 well that's true as a matter of fact my i gave the amp to my little brother and he's still using it yeah that is true i'll ha[ve]- i'll have to admit [noise] but they have come down in price but there again they're they're made a lot cheaper

sw3935A-ms98-a-0035 226.578125 228.081625 uh-huh

sw3935A-ms98-a-0040 272.938250 286.751250 yeah so yeah and i- i agree with you if we had done it i would have felt maybe it was biased which that's a terrible thing to say but [noise] well i don't know it's um it we're living in an interesting time i mean certainly the Japanese have shown that
sw3935A-ms98-a-0041 286.751250 293.225750 you know they can really produce some quality merchandise and at the same time um
sw3935A-ms98-a-0042 293.225750 298.562000 i think what it's forced uh American manufacturing to realize is that they're gonna
