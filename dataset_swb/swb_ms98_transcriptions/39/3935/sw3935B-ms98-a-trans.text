sw3935B-ms98-a-0070 230.329250 242.595375 they were saying that they did a study on it and the Japanese actually uh i mean the United States actually produces six point five percent more product
sw3935B-ms98-a-0071 242.595375 247.096375 in the time um more products
sw3935B-ms98-a-0072 247.096375 255.217875 than the Japanese do and the Japanese take twice as much time and work but they don't get the pro[ductivity]- productivity out of it 
sw3935B-ms98-a-0073 255.217875 266.323125 and that they do because of the hours they put in that that's what they loo[se]- they loose and i thought it was very interesting and they said in the and the unique part of it is that the Japanese are the ones
sw3935B-ms98-a-0074 266.323125 274.548125 that um did the study it wasn't as though we were doing it to show them they did the study so i go[t]- i go[t]- i got a big kick out of that one
