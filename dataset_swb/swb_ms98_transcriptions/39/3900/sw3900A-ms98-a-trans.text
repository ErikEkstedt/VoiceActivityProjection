sw3900A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 3.614625 [noise] yeah what do you think about our level of funding to Middle East Trust
sw3900A-ms98-a-0002 3.614625 6.056500 [silence]
sw3900A-ms98-a-0003 6.056500 7.310125 [noise]
sw3900A-ms98-a-0004 7.310125 10.987625 [silence]
sw3900A-ms98-a-0005 10.987625 14.810875 yeah i was i was thinking while i was waiting to be connected with uh
sw3900A-ms98-a-0006 14.810875 28.169875 uh another party you know i got real ambivalent uh kind of mixed feelings about it i mean i agree with you i think you know jeez there's an awful lot of money that we go over there to people that [noise] seem to be [noise] uh shall we say less than appreciative
sw3900A-ms98-a-0007 28.169875 32.285125 and at and and at the same time i[t]- uh
sw3900A-ms98-a-0008 32.285125 38.007375 you know i think it's important for us that you know there is some sort of stability in that region
sw3900A-ms98-a-0009 38.007375 46.503375 but i don't know then again you uh historically there has such a history of uh you know just [vocalized-noise] being constantly in turmoil
sw3900A-ms98-a-0010 46.503375 54.154250 that i don't know if we can throw enough dollars at them to you know keep any kind of a lasting [noise] peace over there
sw3900A-ms98-a-0011 54.154250 63.911125 so i don't it's it's i i guess bottom line if i had to uh to call the shot i would like to see the the money spent a little more uh judiciously
sw3900A-ms98-a-0012 63.911125 86.336250 [silence]
sw3900A-ms98-a-0013 86.336250 88.595625 oh yeah yeah

sw3900A-ms98-a-0017 101.981000 109.032750 yeah well that was exactly who i i was thinking about whenever i made the comment of uh you know money going to people that seem less than appreciative
sw3900A-ms98-a-0018 109.032750 121.722375 i mean they're they're ready to take it and we se[t]- you know have have set uh a precedence over the history with them of always having an open pocket book uh and uh you know they've just have grown to expect it
sw3900A-ms98-a-0019 121.722375 133.039875 and uh i don't mind uh helping people that i mean i don't expect somebody to grovel but at the same time don't uh you know take the money and and then uh slap me in the face
sw3900A-ms98-a-0020 133.039875 135.000125 [silence]

sw3900A-ms98-a-0027 162.932875 173.222125 yeah the one good thing about the Gulf War i i mean there was several good things about it but it was [noise] one of the few things that we've ever done as a as a country that i think practically paid for itself
sw3900A-ms98-a-0028 173.222125 174.486750 [silence]
sw3900A-ms98-a-0029 174.486750 181.125625 and certainly there are countries over there that have the where with all to uh uh foot their fair share of the bill
sw3900A-ms98-a-0030 181.125625 182.518875 yeah
sw3900A-ms98-a-0031 182.518875 186.357750 [silence]
