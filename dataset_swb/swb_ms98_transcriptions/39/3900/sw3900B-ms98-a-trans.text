sw3900B-ms98-a-0003 3.118375 10.824750 well i i think we could use a lot of it at home but definitely a hot spot is the poor last year proved
sw3900B-ms98-a-0004 10.824750 12.742625 [noise] a lot of [noise]
sw3900B-ms98-a-0005 12.742625 27.511500 [silence]
sw3900B-ms98-a-0006 27.511500 29.552250 i agree [noise]
sw3900B-ms98-a-0007 29.552250 63.395500 [silence]
sw3900B-ms98-a-0008 63.395500 72.327625 uh i i agree i like the i like the the peace process spend more money on things like that and especially with um i don't know the
sw3900B-ms98-a-0009 72.327625 80.490625 [noise] Palestinians and the Israelis fighting so much over who is going to go to this peace conference i'd tie some of the money to those peace conferences if
sw3900B-ms98-a-0010 80.490625 87.506625 they don't want to go to the peace conference then i guess they don't want the two billion dollars for the next batch of F fifteens or whatever
sw3900B-ms98-a-0011 87.506625 94.141375 b[ut]- which we'll never do but i- i think it is about time especially with the Israelis that we
sw3900B-ms98-a-0012 94.141375 103.043875 because many times in the past they've you know they're happy to take our money and stuff but they often times fail to give us any support in return
sw3900B-ms98-a-0013 103.043875 132.065000 [silence]
sw3900B-ms98-a-0014 132.065000 145.775125 right well uh [laughter-they] they seem to do a lot of that stuff the problem i have [noise] in the past at least it was you know they were very st[rategically]- strategically important to us but i think that's diminished a lot lately too
sw3900B-ms98-a-0015 145.775125 155.738125 especially with the relationship we've started to develop with Saudi Arabia after the Gulf War and all [noise] and i don't know maybe we could use that to our advantage [noise]
sw3900B-ms98-a-0016 155.738125 163.346000 at least if we are going to be giving them all this money then at least [noise] you know we should get some at least some cooperation or whatever in return
sw3900B-ms98-a-0017 163.346000 172.842875 [silence]
sw3900B-ms98-a-0018 172.842875 174.222375 right [noise]
sw3900B-ms98-a-0019 174.222375 180.481750 [silence]
sw3900B-ms98-a-0020 180.481750 182.233750 well that's for sure
sw3900B-ms98-a-0021 182.233750 189.144125 and we built some good friends over there now with uh time when we can use them you know little rut
sw3900B-ms98-a-0022 189.144125 195.082750 [silence]
sw3900B-ms98-a-0023 195.082750 204.825250 right well most of the large enemies were large enemies to begin with though there's not too many people that went from being our friends to being our enemies but just
sw3900B-ms98-a-0024 204.825250 210.077750 quite a few that have been from our enemies to at least tolerating us or whate[ver]-
sw3900B-ms98-a-0025 210.077750 217.623750 [silence]
sw3900B-ms98-a-0026 217.623750 219.229875 right
sw3900B-ms98-a-0027 219.229875 230.081750 that's right uh and i don't know Ira[n]- Iran now wants them to reestablish more normal relationships with us i don't know if that is in our [laughter-best] interests either but
sw3900B-ms98-a-0028 230.081750 241.201750 it's good that i don't know i[t]- it seems slightly more stable now but how long that lasts you know it can history has shown that can just be a lull before the storm
sw3900B-ms98-a-0029 241.201750 257.303125 [silence]

sw3900B-ms98-a-0032 262.994375 268.611750 well they have the all the religious battles they have the nationalist battle they just seem to have a lot of
sw3900B-ms98-a-0033 268.611750 280.158000 different cultures and religions nationalisms all packed into that one small geographical area they all believe that they have rights to these lands you know there's
sw3900B-ms98-a-0034 280.158000 285.873875 two three four groups that all believe that this portion of land rightfully is their's
sw3900B-ms98-a-0035 285.873875 295.490250 hopefully you know optimistically may[be]- maybe something you know i don't think it's all going to be rosy after this latest round of peace talks but hopefully it can be
sw3900B-ms98-a-0036 295.490250 298.495875 a start at least in the right direction
sw3900B-ms98-a-0037 298.495875 299.938000 [silence]
