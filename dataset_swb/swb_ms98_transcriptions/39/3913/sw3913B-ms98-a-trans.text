sw3913B-ms98-a-0005 6.403375 9.791750 uh when i went to school there was probably three
sw3913B-ms98-a-0006 9.791750 13.584625 you know in various ages but you don't you don't find that name very often
sw3913B-ms98-a-0007 13.584625 19.241750 [silence]
sw3913B-ms98-a-0008 19.241750 24.539000 uh we just got through having the ceiling in the kitchen touched up
sw3913B-ms98-a-0009 24.539000 31.196375 the roof we had a lot of rain and the roof was leaking and it went down and had a big spot on the ceiling
sw3913B-ms98-a-0010 31.196375 34.769375 and we intended to to fix it ourselves
sw3913B-ms98-a-0011 34.769375 42.596625 and that didn't work so we ended up hiring just uh a handy man and it turned into a huge project for him
sw3913B-ms98-a-0012 42.596625 48.290000 and he couldn't he tried to match the spot and he couldn't match it and ended up having to do the whole ceiling over
sw3913B-ms98-a-0013 48.290000 49.958000 [silence]
sw3913B-ms98-a-0014 49.958000 52.317625 [laughter]

sw3913B-ms98-a-0017 62.556250 75.004500 [silence]
sw3913B-ms98-a-0018 75.004500 88.234250 yeah i think so but we tried just at first just kind of spackling it it's one of those type ceilings this is an older house and we were trying to just repair that and match the the uh texture
sw3913B-ms98-a-0019 88.234250 90.953500 and we couldn't do that and then
sw3913B-ms98-a-0020 90.953500 94.313625 [silence]
sw3913B-ms98-a-0021 94.313625 101.820250 it's i'm not even sure what it is it's not like the kind at my mother's house is a blown texture
sw3913B-ms98-a-0022 101.820250 106.052500 and this is an old older house and it's kind of a
sw3913B-ms98-a-0023 106.052500 108.730250 sponge is what it looks like to me [laughter]
sw3913B-ms98-a-0024 108.730250 111.784125 that they took the uh plaster and kind of sponged it
sw3913B-ms98-a-0025 111.784125 116.312500 but it's a different pattern and he had so much trouble trying to match it
sw3913B-ms98-a-0026 116.312500 122.045750 and the paint and everything he finally just had to redo the whole [laughter-ceiling] repaint the whole thing
sw3913B-ms98-a-0027 122.045750 123.228625 [silence]
sw3913B-ms98-a-0028 123.228625 124.324750 uh-huh
sw3913B-ms98-a-0029 124.324750 128.740000 but he uh i was surprised he stuck with the price that he had quoted
sw3913B-ms98-a-0030 128.740000 139.773625 which was just a couple a hundred dollars to fix the one place and then he found out that the beam there was no support to attach his stuff to and it it turned out to be a mess 
sw3913B-ms98-a-0031 139.773625 143.674125 [laughter-he] finally finally got it finished
sw3913B-ms98-a-0032 143.674125 154.324625 it does i was i because_1 it took several days and i work so he was on his own during the hou[se]- during the day and then i would just have to come home and and call him at night and say excuse me 
sw3913B-ms98-a-0033 154.324625 156.477750 [laughter] this doesn't look good
sw3913B-ms98-a-0034 156.477750 162.355375 because he was going to let it go if i hadn't said anything at first when it didn't match and stuff he was just going to go with that
sw3913B-ms98-a-0035 162.355375 170.634500 and i am sure nobody would notice if they come in they don't look up immediately but i noticed but when he fixed it
sw3913B-ms98-a-0036 170.634500 180.014375 but this the house it belongs to my father-in-law and our deal as far as living here and each month we fix something
sw3913B-ms98-a-0037 180.014375 191.164750 and we put a deck in and we landscaped the yard and we put new carpeting in and we put new linoleum in and then we had the ceiling fixed and put a new floor in the bathroom
sw3913B-ms98-a-0038 191.164750 196.312000 and wallpaper but just as soon as you get finished with one job it's time for another [laughter-one]
