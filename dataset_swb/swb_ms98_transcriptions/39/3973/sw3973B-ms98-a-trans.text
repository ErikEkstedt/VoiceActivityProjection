sw3973B-ms98-a-0004 1.853125 5.041875 [silence]
sw3973B-ms98-a-0005 5.041875 17.766750 well i tell you what my going to work clothes has changed over a period of years i used to work in an office and i would and i thought that i would have to have a lot of clothes
sw3973B-ms98-a-0006 17.766750 27.341500 because when you go and work around a lot of people for some reason i just felt the need to have a a nice variety and l[ook]- and look different
sw3973B-ms98-a-0007 27.341500 37.516375 now i work in an office in my home and i'm doing office work and i go out and call on people in their homes i sell insurance
sw3973B-ms98-a-0008 37.516375 48.795750 so i could wear the same thing every single day and it really wouldn't make any difference so and sometimes i do that it's just very very strange and different
sw3973B-ms98-a-0009 48.795750 63.545000 it's a different feeling i get up and i- i dress as i would go out to an appointment even if i'm going to stay in my office for most of the day or half of the day i just get up and get dressed like i was going you know out
sw3973B-ms98-a-0010 63.545000 69.072125 but it is this strange feeling to really realize that i really don't need
sw3973B-ms98-a-0011 69.072125 71.159500 a large wardrobe
sw3973B-ms98-a-0012 71.159500 72.424375 [silence]
sw3973B-ms98-a-0013 72.424375 77.873625 and um that i can go and and i could wear the very same thing every single day
sw3973B-ms98-a-0014 77.873625 80.029875 how how do you do what
sw3973B-ms98-a-0015 80.029875 83.074250 [silence]
sw3973B-ms98-a-0016 83.074250 86.258375 yeah well i- i wear dresses or suits too
sw3973B-ms98-a-0017 86.258375 92.520500 [silence]

sw3973B-ms98-a-0019 94.214875 95.513750 right
sw3973B-ms98-a-0020 95.513750 97.887875 [silence]
sw3973B-ms98-a-0021 97.887875 98.846125 um-hum
sw3973B-ms98-a-0022 98.846125 100.323000 [silence]
sw3973B-ms98-a-0023 100.323000 102.504875 have you always lived in this area
sw3973B-ms98-a-0024 102.504875 106.875875 [silence]
sw3973B-ms98-a-0025 106.875875 107.814250 um-hum
sw3973B-ms98-a-0026 107.814250 120.423500 well it seems to me like maybe fifteen years ago i've always lived in this area and it seems like about fifteen to twenty years ago i would see more of a significant difference in the seasons
sw3973B-ms98-a-0027 120.423500 129.841750 and um i had a tendency to really buy wool clothes for the winter and really make a a definite change
sw3973B-ms98-a-0028 129.841750 140.229375 and it seems like the last few years i've had a tendency to even though i want to continue that it's just kind of been a pattern
sw3973B-ms98-a-0029 140.229375 154.801750 i have i really don't wear my wool clothes any more so i've really had to make a concerted effort to buy lighter weight clothing and and and now most of my suits will wear all all year around
sw3973B-ms98-a-0030 154.801750 158.146250 [silence]
sw3973B-ms98-a-0031 158.146250 172.901875 well i[t]- i'm i it i just wonder if it's the fabrics or if if there's been that much change in in uh the seasons it seems to me like we're not having as cold a weather in this area as we used to have many years ago
sw3973B-ms98-a-0032 172.901875 178.396750 [silence]

sw3973B-ms98-a-0039 204.088875 214.804375 so that i would have something warm enough and i didn't need anything i mean it just happened to be the week that i was there it was just really nice and pleasant so [noise]
