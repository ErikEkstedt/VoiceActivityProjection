sw3907A-ms98-a-0025 154.048625 155.215625 uh
sw3907A-ms98-a-0026 155.215625 157.668000 [silence]

sw3907A-ms98-a-0030 174.473500 182.487625 and she came home with it and she was real proud and she said okay well we've got a lifetime supply now [laughter-so] [laughter-we've] [laughter-got] no excuse and uh
sw3907A-ms98-a-0031 182.487625 183.746125 [silence]
sw3907A-ms98-a-0032 183.746125 191.827750 well we uh have uh i guess in the last two or three years really discovered that we're really fond of hot peppers and so um
sw3907A-ms98-a-0033 191.827750 203.125750 we grow tomatoes down one side of the house where we get a lot of sun and then in our regular garden plot this past uh couple of years we've grown a lot of different varieties of hot peppers
sw3907A-ms98-a-0034 203.125750 216.178250 uh yes which of course are our favorites and uh but we've also grown a lot of real um uh hot uh smaller varieties like {Tais} and um
sw3907A-ms98-a-0035 216.178250 217.581000 uh
sw3907A-ms98-a-0036 217.581000 230.642250 yeah yeah the cayennes and we've even grown some little funny uh uh peppers and i've n[ever]- i've never been sure one of them_1 i believe is called Chili Tepid and the other one is called Pequine and um
sw3907A-ms98-a-0037 230.642250 237.341250 they're they're little tiny hot things that we she takes them_1 inside and she dries them and then we eat and [vocalized-noise]
sw3907A-ms98-a-0038 237.341250 240.159375 [silence]
sw3907A-ms98-a-0039 240.159375 242.216750 they're little green
sw3907A-ms98-a-0040 242.216750 251.784875 literally pea size peppers they're they're just little tiny guys and they dry up even smaller than they are when they're they're you know fresh food on the um
sw3907A-ms98-a-0041 251.784875 259.548000 the plant but the plants are just incredibly prodigious they just produce zillions of them um
sw3907A-ms98-a-0042 259.548000 272.351500 uh all kinds of dishes we like i say we grind them up and um we freeze some of them and then use them in stews and uh whenever we make egg dishes or anything like that we tend to
sw3907A-ms98-a-0043 272.351500 278.270500 to put some on it it's just incredible with the numbers of ways that we come up to use them
sw3907A-ms98-a-0044 278.270500 288.766000 and uh it's it's funny i mean we were laughing at ourselves one night because we uh we realized that um we had uh [laughter] [laughter-we] [laughter-were] [laughter-having] it with every meal
sw3907A-ms98-a-0045 288.766000 299.522000 but anyway it it's uh it's something that we enjoy immensely and it we get a lot of pleasure out of i love tilling up the garden every year and um uh you know getting out there and just spending some
