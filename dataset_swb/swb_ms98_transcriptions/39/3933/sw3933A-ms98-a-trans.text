sw3933A-ms98-a-0011 34.588125 42.073750 you know what i've noticed at least in ou[r]- in my field that that works is to require before a person can
sw3933A-ms98-a-0012 42.073750 50.646875 enter the school program that they do a number of volunteer hours in that field or in in an environment that's related to that field and
sw3933A-ms98-a-0013 50.646875 58.193625 that might be more motivating um in relation to what you just mentioned if it were somehow of interest to them
sw3933A-ms98-a-0014 58.193625 62.195250 i suppose uh that would really require a lot of
sw3933A-ms98-a-0015 62.195250 67.977750 participation on the part of employers to require a certain number of
sw3933A-ms98-a-0016 67.977750 72.767750 c[ommunity]- uh community service hours in their area [laughter] that's

sw3933A-ms98-a-0021 83.486500 87.309500 i really like the idea of young people getting a chance to
sw3933A-ms98-a-0022 87.309500 93.330125 to do something of a volunteer nature maybe in another country but that that's difficult for a lot of people i guess financially to
sw3933A-ms98-a-0023 93.330125 105.718125 to manage but it would certainly i think contribute to a person's responsibility and and sense of maturity um to recognize what other cultures and other countries
sw3933A-ms98-a-0024 105.718125 112.386625 go through in terms of their day to day existence if you're working in Peace Corps for example you're really gonna be able to learn those things

sw3933A-ms98-a-0039 160.954000 166.408500 it's a little challenging today too to think about being in another country where there's
sw3933A-ms98-a-0040 166.408500 174.230125 uh potentially political or [noise] military problems that are gonna effect Peace Corps workers if a person is volunteering
sw3933A-ms98-a-0041 174.230125 179.548750 it's one thing because they recognize there's a minimal danger where where they might be but if you're [laughter]
sw3933A-ms98-a-0042 179.548750 189.552625 expecting that they have to do it then y[ou]- you you perhaps the wh[oever]- the whoever the organization is requiring it does assume some responsibility too

sw3933A-ms98-a-0051 217.985500 228.582375 i- i think it's terrific to have criminals involved in community services and i really like the idea of avoiding jail time for people who are just um um
sw3933A-ms98-a-0052 228.582375 235.219125 paying if you wanna call it that for minor offenses having them do something in the in the community

sw3933A-ms98-a-0054 240.038875 251.032125 i i'm an occupational therapist and so it's hospital work that um i know this is true in occupational therapy as well as physical therapy there's so many people who are applying to the schools right now
sw3933A-ms98-a-0055 251.032125 260.382750 that they require that you do X number of volunteer hours i think it's a hundred or so before you can even be accepted into the school program to become a therapist

sw3933A-ms98-a-0057 262.884000 270.469125 i believe you do yeah you have to volunteer in a department that that provides occupational therapy or physical therapy if that's the
sw3933A-ms98-a-0058 270.469125 280.655250 the area you're pursuing i'm sure that there are other reasons for them wanting people to do that because a person may actually get into the program and not have a very good idea of what
sw3933A-ms98-a-0059 280.655250 292.282500 it is to be an OT or a PT and having been a volunteer they'll certainly see people on the job and recognize well this is really what i wanna do i wanna spend three or four years getting this [laughter-experience]
