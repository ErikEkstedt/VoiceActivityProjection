sw3946A-ms98-a-0002 2.504750 13.615500 okay well i don't have an elderly person that i could send to a a nursing home or anything my both of my parents are dead
sw3946A-ms98-a-0003 13.615500 19.432500 but i did have a friend that was in a convalescent home uh like a nursing home
sw3946A-ms98-a-0004 19.432500 24.203000 and i h[ad]- went there very often to visit her and uh
sw3946A-ms98-a-0005 24.203000 29.902000 made me feel really sad if i did have a mother living i don't think i could do that
sw3946A-ms98-a-0006 29.902000 35.189875 i think they would be better off being at home with their family
sw3946A-ms98-a-0007 35.189875 36.756750 you know
sw3946A-ms98-a-0008 36.756750 39.694750 [silence]

sw3946A-ms98-a-0016 61.670750 73.486625 oh i can believe that yes because most elderly people can't take having a lot of noise and kids running around and things like that in a situation like that maybe it would be better
sw3946A-ms98-a-0017 73.486625 78.409000 [silence]

sw3946A-ms98-a-0030 110.830125 115.059875 [silence]
sw3946A-ms98-a-0031 115.059875 116.676250 um-hum
sw3946A-ms98-a-0032 116.676250 119.014000 yeah right right
sw3946A-ms98-a-0033 119.014000 121.047250 [noise]
sw3946A-ms98-a-0034 121.047250 130.599375 yeah in a case like that you know you more or less think it it would be better if she were in a nursing home because you have your family growing up where
sw3946A-ms98-a-0035 130.599375 136.112625 [silence]
sw3946A-ms98-a-0036 136.112625 138.088500 uh-huh uh-huh
sw3946A-ms98-a-0037 138.088500 139.878625 [silence]
sw3946A-ms98-a-0038 139.878625 144.596000 uh-huh but the cost of these nursing homes are so
sw3946A-ms98-a-0039 144.596000 148.006375 you know a lot of people can't afford that
sw3946A-ms98-a-0040 148.006375 154.949625 you know so you really have no choice that way if you you know if you're not rich or s[omething]- you know um
sw3946A-ms98-a-0041 154.949625 165.505375 i know this lady that you know that was a friend of mine now her husband was still alive at the time when she was in there you know and it was costing him a small fortune to keep her in there
sw3946A-ms98-a-0042 165.505375 167.080875 so
sw3946A-ms98-a-0043 167.080875 170.038500 [silence]

sw3946A-ms98-a-0046 174.665750 177.300500 yeah then bring her back home at night
sw3946A-ms98-a-0047 177.300500 180.686750 [silence]
sw3946A-ms98-a-0048 180.686750 182.643250 um-hum um-hum

sw3946A-ms98-a-0050 184.153875 195.627250 yeah you know just come home for dinner and then usually they want to go to bed pretty early anyhow you know so that would probably be nice if we could ever get something like that but
sw3946A-ms98-a-0051 195.627250 197.286500 [silence]
sw3946A-ms98-a-0052 197.286500 198.880375 right

sw3946A-ms98-a-0065 231.442125 239.687750 if if they don't know anybody and they don't know what's going on around them and everything like that well i can see maybe a nursing home would be better you know
sw3946A-ms98-a-0066 239.687750 244.511750 but if they they have their wits about them_1 and everything why
sw3946A-ms98-a-0067 244.511750 247.203375 it's kind of hard [laughter]

sw3946A-ms98-a-0072 259.391375 265.339000 well uh my mother always said she hopes she never had to be like that and
sw3946A-ms98-a-0073 265.339000 276.311500 uh luckily i mean she lived by herself and then you know one day she had a heart attack and she was gone so she never did have to go into a nursing home or anything like that but there's
sw3946A-ms98-a-0074 276.311500 283.332500 so many of us kids there was like seven of us that my we wouldn't have probably allowed that to happen anyhow
sw3946A-ms98-a-0075 283.332500 294.040250 you know she could've taken turns living with each one of us you know for a sh[ort]- a sh[ort]- a period of time because_1 we all don't live in the same city anyhow o[r]- nor the same state
sw3946A-ms98-a-0076 294.040250 295.549375 so
sw3946A-ms98-a-0077 295.549375 300.482000 uh uh a c[ouple]- i have a couple more that live out here in California but then i have a broth[er]-
