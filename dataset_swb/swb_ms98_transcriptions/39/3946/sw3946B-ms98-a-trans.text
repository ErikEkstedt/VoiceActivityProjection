sw3946B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.156500 [noise]
sw3946B-ms98-a-0002 1.156500 4.178500 why don't you go ahead and start off [laughter]
sw3946B-ms98-a-0003 4.178500 36.537000 [silence]
sw3946B-ms98-a-0004 36.537000 45.599125 i agree although we're in that situation right now we have a an eighty seven year old mother-in-law living with me right now
sw3946B-ms98-a-0005 45.599125 50.936625 and because of her circumstances she can no longer live independently
sw3946B-ms98-a-0006 50.936625 62.565750 and even moving from her house to our house has been tremendously unsettling for her and we have several young children and they about drive her crazy
sw3946B-ms98-a-0007 62.565750 72.909750 [silence]
sw3946B-ms98-a-0008 72.909750 79.288750 well we've you know we've struggled a lot with it because_1 again uh most of the nursing homes i've been in are very depressing to me
sw3946B-ms98-a-0009 79.288750 88.237875 and she's still alert enough that i think she would really know that we were putting her there and i think she'd really resent it
sw3946B-ms98-a-0010 88.237875 94.916125 and i think that would make it very hard but on the other hand i see my wife with i guess our youngest one now is five
sw3946B-ms98-a-0011 94.916125 103.604000 and her trying to struggle because her mother really cannot take care of herself she needs to be bathed and dressed and a lot of those kinds of things
sw3946B-ms98-a-0012 103.604000 105.738625 [silence]
sw3946B-ms98-a-0013 105.738625 109.113875 and so the drain on the family
sw3946B-ms98-a-0014 109.113875 118.296875 and when the kids have kids come over you know she's always saying well why do they have to be here why can't they send them home it's too noisy and she'll say that to the kid's friends
sw3946B-ms98-a-0015 118.296875 122.073125 so it's a hard situation either way i think
sw3946B-ms98-a-0016 122.073125 129.330750 [silence]
sw3946B-ms98-a-0017 129.330750 140.795000 and i think that's one of the things we're really wrestling with when does it become detrimental to our family to the point that you have to consider that as opposed to considering her current circumstances and
sw3946B-ms98-a-0018 140.795000 143.696625 [silence]
sw3946B-ms98-a-0019 143.696625 145.947250 oh prohibitive
sw3946B-ms98-a-0020 145.947250 147.055250 [silence]
sw3946B-ms98-a-0021 147.055250 148.333750 yeah
sw3946B-ms98-a-0022 148.333750 164.460625 [silence]
sw3946B-ms98-a-0023 164.460625 165.603750 yeah
sw3946B-ms98-a-0024 165.603750 170.301875 i think we need to develop some alternatives like adult day care
sw3946B-ms98-a-0025 170.301875 175.582125 that's more readily available you know i think if we could send her someplace for the day
sw3946B-ms98-a-0026 175.582125 185.093250 and she could be around some elderly people and have some activities would be of more interest to her and then in the evening have her return and be with the family
sw3946B-ms98-a-0027 185.093250 188.816250 [silence]
sw3946B-ms98-a-0028 188.816250 190.092250 yeah
sw3946B-ms98-a-0029 190.092250 194.586750 [silence]
sw3946B-ms98-a-0030 194.586750 199.758000 but there's not many of those available right now and they're very hard to get them_1 into and
sw3946B-ms98-a-0031 199.758000 212.191625 we tried sending her to a senior citizen center but they're really not prepared to cope with her because she's somewhat senile and so a lot of the activities that they're engaged in she can't participate in
sw3946B-ms98-a-0032 212.191625 214.563625 [silence]
sw3946B-ms98-a-0033 214.563625 224.294375 but i think it's an issue that you know with the graying of America we're really going to have to as a as a country figure out how we're going to deal with this
sw3946B-ms98-a-0034 224.294375 231.339250 because it is a difficult situation and you know you hate seeing them just sort of send off and not well cared for
sw3946B-ms98-a-0035 231.339250 232.983125 and yet
sw3946B-ms98-a-0036 232.983125 246.258875 [silence]
sw3946B-ms98-a-0037 246.258875 258.149000 and then i think it depends on their physical ability too you know if they could be up and doing some things it might be better than when they're just sort of needing almost constant supervision and care
sw3946B-ms98-a-0038 258.149000 282.693000 [silence]
sw3946B-ms98-a-0039 282.693000 283.922250 yeah
sw3946B-ms98-a-0040 283.922250 293.999000 [silence]
sw3946B-ms98-a-0041 293.999000 296.241625 do you live at all close to each other
sw3946B-ms98-a-0042 296.241625 300.482000 [silence]
