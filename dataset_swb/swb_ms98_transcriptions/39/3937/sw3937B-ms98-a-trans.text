sw3937B-ms98-a-0007 26.439250 27.580125 [silence]
sw3937B-ms98-a-0008 27.580125 32.407375 that makes a difference uh here in Dallas they're trying to
sw3937B-ms98-a-0009 32.407375 45.880000 to start some curbside recycling i think they're doing a test uh personally my husband and i do plastic and glass and newspaper and cans but we have to uh take them you know to
sw3937B-ms98-a-0010 45.880000 57.904375 to areas and the problem that i'm finding is that uh a lot of the places i've been taking things have now discontinued the recycling policy like it's hard to find a place to take newspapers anymore
sw3937B-ms98-a-0011 57.904375 65.503125 [silence]
sw3937B-ms98-a-0012 65.503125 66.977875 oh really
sw3937B-ms98-a-0013 66.977875 76.632500 [silence]
sw3937B-ms98-a-0014 76.632500 91.499625 well i noticed a difference uh we go to the Kroger store uh here to take our aluminum cans and i noticed a difference you know i'd be getting perhaps a dollar for whatever i took in and i think the last bunch i took in which i didn't think was much smaller was maybe twenty six cents
sw3937B-ms98-a-0015 91.499625 124.931250 [silence]
sw3937B-ms98-a-0016 124.931250 126.209125 um-hum
sw3937B-ms98-a-0017 126.209125 139.110875 [silence]
sw3937B-ms98-a-0018 139.110875 152.094500 well you know what is so sad is that people are finally i think willing to do something about this and then all of a sudden uh the the demand isn't there you know it's too expensive to recycle but i personally feel that we're going to have to
sw3937B-ms98-a-0019 152.094500 166.476125 pay the price you know whether the government subsidizes it and i'm you know i sorry to the gov[ernment]- government get involved in too much of anything else like that but something has to be done we're just uh we're using our natural resources we're filling up the dumps and
sw3937B-ms98-a-0020 166.476125 175.813000 [silence]

sw3937B-ms98-a-0023 206.855625 208.544250 uh-huh
sw3937B-ms98-a-0024 208.544250 223.004250 well and i know uh too my mother lives in a rural area also and it she would have to go like thirty miles to recycle anything and s[o]- c[ourse]- so of course sh[e]- she doesn't and plus uh it's difficult for her to
sw3937B-ms98-a-0025 223.004250 229.598375 drive around just all that much so in a case like that you know they have to make it a little bit easier for people
sw3937B-ms98-a-0026 229.598375 231.002250 to do that
sw3937B-ms98-a-0027 231.002250 242.899500 and um i'm hoping that they do this curbside recycling i'll be willing to pay a little extra you know if they'll go ahead and pick it up quite frankly it'll save me money in gas running around [laughter-all] [laughter-over] [laughter-town]
sw3937B-ms98-a-0028 242.899500 249.462375 [laughter] and i take my uh paper i always get paper bags and i take them back to the grocery store and use them again
sw3937B-ms98-a-0029 249.462375 253.460875 so you know little bit here and little bit there i guess it all helps
sw3937B-ms98-a-0030 253.460875 281.808250 [silence]
