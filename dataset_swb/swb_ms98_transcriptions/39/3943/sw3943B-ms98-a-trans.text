sw3943B-ms98-a-0002 0.995875 4.358500 [silence]
sw3943B-ms98-a-0003 4.358500 14.205125 well that's uh debatable [laughter-if] if you read the paper every day [laughter] looks like there's a new scandal breaking ever ever minute uh
sw3943B-ms98-a-0004 14.205125 21.522875 [silence]
sw3943B-ms98-a-0005 21.522875 27.602125 yeah it is that guy that does the traveling show that's that's on Broadway and everything now
sw3943B-ms98-a-0006 27.602125 40.093875 yeah that's supposed to be great i don't know as long as there lawyers making up the majority of the state legislatures and the national Congress uh
sw3943B-ms98-a-0007 40.093875 44.688500 i don't see a lot of change happening [laughter]
sw3943B-ms98-a-0008 44.688500 61.457625 [silence]
sw3943B-ms98-a-0009 61.457625 69.449625 isn't that funny how that just happens to be a correlation [laughter]
sw3943B-ms98-a-0010 69.449625 72.383625 [silence]
sw3943B-ms98-a-0011 72.383625 75.078000 i'm afraid not unfortunately
sw3943B-ms98-a-0012 75.078000 80.954125 [silence]
sw3943B-ms98-a-0013 80.954125 85.348250 [laughter] [laughter-right] i saw a
sw3943B-ms98-a-0014 85.348250 95.956250 a lawyer joke book the other day and it and the title of the joke was skid marks [laughter] and of course there's a major joke about skid marks and lawyers
sw3943B-ms98-a-0015 95.956250 100.590250 but uh i don't know it just it's pretty disgusting every time you
sw3943B-ms98-a-0016 100.590250 107.947625 it it's not just the unethical part of it it's the self-serving part of it
sw3943B-ms98-a-0017 107.947625 112.514250 that bothers me about the politicians they're all out
sw3943B-ms98-a-0018 112.514250 126.645000 either for a particular controlled interest group of some kind or maybe several uh and rather than really honestly decide issues on the basis of what is good for the country
sw3943B-ms98-a-0019 126.645000 137.002125 everybody decides them with this the constituency in mind or or afraid that they're gonna hack off the wrong group or the other vote wise
sw3943B-ms98-a-0020 137.002125 144.692750 and yeah exactly and so we if we just limited terms senators especially
sw3943B-ms98-a-0021 144.692750 153.479250 and even Supreme Court judges this appointing them_1 for life is just absurd they wind up senile old men making decisions at eighty years old
sw3943B-ms98-a-0022 153.479250 166.215125 just just say that the most you can serve is a couple of terms and then get in there and then you could get in there and do the best possible job that you really feel like you should be doing and then you're out of there and go on to something else instead of this
sw3943B-ms98-a-0023 166.215125 179.099500 [vocalized-noise] because_1 this exactly well at least you'd decide things you'd decide things from the stand point of what's best hopefully for whatever agency you're representing
sw3943B-ms98-a-0024 179.099500 190.121000 [silence]
sw3943B-ms98-a-0025 190.121000 191.658375 yeah i know
sw3943B-ms98-a-0026 191.658375 194.842625 [silence]
sw3943B-ms98-a-0027 194.842625 203.665875 i j[ust]- i just think we ought to we limit the President why not terms of the others and give there's plenty of other qualified people to run
sw3943B-ms98-a-0028 203.665875 208.795500 [silence]
sw3943B-ms98-a-0029 208.795500 210.310625 um-hum

sw3943B-ms98-a-0036 239.850125 247.906250 [silence]
sw3943B-ms98-a-0037 247.906250 249.133125 yep
sw3943B-ms98-a-0038 249.133125 253.731500 [silence]
sw3943B-ms98-a-0039 253.731500 256.335750 yeah that's that's probably true
sw3943B-ms98-a-0040 256.335750 257.338125 [silence]
sw3943B-ms98-a-0041 257.338125 258.565125 i haven't

sw3943B-ms98-a-0043 264.008000 265.743625 yeah i don't
sw3943B-ms98-a-0044 265.743625 274.247875 well that's it when the very people making the laws are gonna be the ones who would have to pass those uh against themselves it it sort of uh
sw3943B-ms98-a-0045 274.247875 284.681750 goes without saying that it'd be awfully awfully tough unless you could get the best thing that could happen uh to the state legislatures would be to be full of just
sw3943B-ms98-a-0046 284.681750 292.032125 i[ndependent]- i[ndependent]- independent businessmen or just businessmen working for companies that could somehow get their salary made
sw3943B-ms98-a-0047 292.032125 299.458000 uh [vocalized-noise] justified you know or brought up to whatever over the state salary level uh
