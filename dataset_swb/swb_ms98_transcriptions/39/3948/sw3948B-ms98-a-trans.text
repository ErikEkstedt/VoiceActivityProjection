sw3948B-ms98-a-0023 97.784625 99.403125 yeah and
sw3948B-ms98-a-0024 99.403125 101.634250 and they were willing to take it back
sw3948B-ms98-a-0025 101.634250 108.589500 yeah oh well you know now that you mention that i was thinking of h[ow]- of more of you know kitchen kind of products or or whatever
sw3948B-ms98-a-0026 108.589500 114.573625 a[nd]- and i i uh bought the silk shirts that The Limited had and i just loved them_1
sw3948B-ms98-a-0027 114.573625 128.476625 and and i bought one out of town and you know at the time i just said could i return it someplace else you know at another Limited they said yes and the silk c[omes]- comes i mean i it's i am finding it amazing that you can just put 
sw3948B-ms98-a-0028 128.476625 136.783375 silk in the [laughter-washing] [laughter-machine] but nonetheless so i mean it's so it's sort of like a little miracle anyway but it pulled
sw3948B-ms98-a-0029 136.783375 140.421750 i[n]- you know in the facing in the uh
sw3948B-ms98-a-0030 140.421750 141.701500 for the
sw3948B-ms98-a-0031 141.701500 156.660625 where the buttons and the buttonholes are it just the silk just pulled out and i'm a little self conscious about being overweight so you know i kept thinking maybe it's my fault i'm stretching it except the thing just hangs around my body [laughter-you] [laughter-know]
sw3948B-ms98-a-0032 156.660625 170.476000 so i i took it back and they just without question let me get another one and now this other one's doing it too and i think what they're doing is not using enough material right there at that seam so that you know it just pulls apart
sw3948B-ms98-a-0033 170.476000 174.532125 but i'm not sure that i think i don't know do you think things are
sw3948B-ms98-a-0034 174.532125 178.000875 worse quality now than they used to be or
sw3948B-ms98-a-0035 178.000875 181.086000 [silence]

sw3948B-ms98-a-0048 218.102875 229.253125 yeah well course uh stuff comes from all over too so uh and i was just thinking about that of of the things that i've that i've uh bought recently
sw3948B-ms98-a-0049 229.253125 238.777250 i'd i'm a little worried about those long items i just had to buy a new washing machine and uh the one i had was twenty
sw3948B-ms98-a-0050 238.777250 239.932750 [silence]
sw3948B-ms98-a-0051 239.932750 243.114250 one twenty two years old n[o]-
sw3948B-ms98-a-0052 243.114250 254.095500 no no no no it was more like twenty four years old and just had just gone on beautifully the whole time till the end it finally gave up and i had to
sw3948B-ms98-a-0053 254.095500 259.255250 i think maybe repaired once in all those years you know s[o]-
sw3948B-ms98-a-0054 259.255250 270.261250 well i d[id]- so i mean obviously that's what you think about doing it was a it was a Kenmore and um i so i thought about that and then went and found out y[ou]- well you know these
sw3948B-ms98-a-0055 270.261250 278.560000 this company and this company's bought and all the companie[s]- all the washing machines are made by the same company something like that with different names
sw3948B-ms98-a-0056 278.560000 289.679375 and i said well no way [laughter] you what do you mean they're all i mean th[e]- why would they make them why would they make different ones in different names it's the same company making them
sw3948B-ms98-a-0057 289.679375 295.946500 i i found that very upsetting and then it made me think about all the things that have been lasting my refrigerator
sw3948B-ms98-a-0058 295.946500 298.082000 the dryer the dryer's still going
