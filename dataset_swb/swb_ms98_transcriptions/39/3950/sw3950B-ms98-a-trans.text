sw3950B-ms98-a-0012 40.840125 44.905000 and all that and it certainly has been good for me
sw3950B-ms98-a-0013 44.905000 46.879250 so i see myself
sw3950B-ms98-a-0014 46.879250 56.095250 you know when i learn a new system a new program or a new computer language that it's much easier for me than for let's say
sw3950B-ms98-a-0015 56.095250 62.639750 my colleagues who are a lot older but just as intelligent and whatever

sw3950B-ms98-a-0042 177.658750 189.594625 well let's see i think that the mass communication that we have in the world now is in general a good thing and i think it has its good points and
sw3950B-ms98-a-0043 189.594625 193.000375 bad points but in general it's pretty positive
sw3950B-ms98-a-0044 193.000375 195.476625 [silence]
sw3950B-ms98-a-0045 195.476625 200.163500 uh more or less yes i mean it is we have the
sw3950B-ms98-a-0046 200.163500 205.481750 global village you know like Maclean was saying but it doesn't
sw3950B-ms98-a-0047 205.481750 210.518250 i don't think that it really means that we have a sense of community yet as a world

sw3950B-ms98-a-0049 211.780750 216.417750 which hopefully maybe coming we'll have to see
