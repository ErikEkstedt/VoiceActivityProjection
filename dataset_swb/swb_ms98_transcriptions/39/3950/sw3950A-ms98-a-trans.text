sw3950A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.075250 [noise]
sw3950A-ms98-a-0002 1.075250 9.316750 [laughter] i figured you were going to ask me first here i was going to ask you first this is a difficult one i mean unfortunately the first thoughts are sort of negative
sw3950A-ms98-a-0003 9.316750 14.825750 but then when i give myself a chance to think about it a little bit more i recognize the positives as well uh
sw3950A-ms98-a-0004 14.825750 18.389625 positives for sure are technology and
sw3950A-ms98-a-0005 18.389625 24.503875 um some of the changes that the computer age has brought i think that kids growing up today are just
sw3950A-ms98-a-0006 24.503875 31.754750 uh very much more facile than i was as a kid in terms of the use of computer technology and you know
sw3950A-ms98-a-0007 31.754750 33.948375 [silence]
sw3950A-ms98-a-0008 33.948375 35.417250 uh-huh
sw3950A-ms98-a-0009 35.417250 40.001250 [silence]
sw3950A-ms98-a-0010 40.001250 41.750625 uh-huh uh-huh
sw3950A-ms98-a-0011 41.750625 44.305500 [silence]
sw3950A-ms98-a-0012 44.305500 45.529875 yes
sw3950A-ms98-a-0013 45.529875 58.885000 [silence]
sw3950A-ms98-a-0014 58.885000 62.085250 um-hum and the earlier you learn
sw3950A-ms98-a-0015 62.085250 65.474625 yes the younger you are probably the easier it is
sw3950A-ms98-a-0016 65.474625 67.079125 um
sw3950A-ms98-a-0017 67.079125 76.989625 some of that i think probably we take for granted you know the changes have happened so rapidly that it's it's easy for us to forget how quickly it has changed
sw3950A-ms98-a-0018 76.989625 86.716000 i think probably the other thing i that came to mind is is the increased awareness on our part of the the criminal element if i can put it that way you know you you don't 
sw3950A-ms98-a-0019 86.716000 98.084500 you don't uh casually let kids play in the street or you know ride their bike to friends if you're in an area where you're at all concerned about
sw3950A-ms98-a-0020 98.084500 99.776125 abduction
sw3950A-ms98-a-0021 99.776125 104.502375 [silence]
sw3950A-ms98-a-0022 104.502375 112.024500 i think it's changed i think that in the last twenty or thirty years there's definitely been an increase in that type of crime
sw3950A-ms98-a-0023 112.024500 113.131875 [silence]
sw3950A-ms98-a-0024 113.131875 122.940000 and i'm not sure why you know uh certainly a question that we could spend hours [laughter-on] you know whether whether there is a change in
sw3950A-ms98-a-0025 122.940000 131.368125 in the way a lot of individuals grow up whether or not there is you know more mental illness or something that causes that sort of
sw3950A-ms98-a-0026 131.368125 134.393250 thing to go on uh i don't know
sw3950A-ms98-a-0027 134.393250 139.510875 [silence]
sw3950A-ms98-a-0028 139.510875 139.785500 [noise]
sw3950A-ms98-a-0029 139.785500 152.049125 but you know kidnapping is a strange thing you know what kids today are not nearly as free as i was when i was a kid in terms of just being able to go to the store by myself or riding my bike around the neighborhood or
sw3950A-ms98-a-0030 152.049125 165.553125 being being informed at a very young age about uh going to a shopping center and what to do if a stranger approaches you i mean i never had a concept of that as a kid so that's certainly changed a lot in the last ten or twenty years
sw3950A-ms98-a-0031 165.553125 169.044500 [silence]
sw3950A-ms98-a-0032 169.044500 176.334625 anyway what are some positives that you could [laughter] you've thought about besides [noise] spending too much time on the criminal element
sw3950A-ms98-a-0033 176.334625 177.450750 huh
sw3950A-ms98-a-0034 177.450750 190.206375 [silence]
sw3950A-ms98-a-0035 190.206375 192.014625 uh-huh
sw3950A-ms98-a-0036 192.014625 195.591125 it really does bring us together as a global community doesn't it
sw3950A-ms98-a-0037 195.591125 196.932250 [silence]
sw3950A-ms98-a-0038 196.932250 198.092125 um
sw3950A-ms98-a-0039 198.092125 201.691000 [silence]
sw3950A-ms98-a-0040 201.691000 203.092125 um-hum
sw3950A-ms98-a-0041 203.092125 210.083750 [silence]
sw3950A-ms98-a-0042 210.083750 212.263125 uh that's a good point
sw3950A-ms98-a-0043 212.263125 215.542625 [silence]
sw3950A-ms98-a-0044 215.542625 217.867125 uh-huh uh-huh
sw3950A-ms98-a-0045 217.867125 226.302750 i think that's something that uh is a political influence as well you know probably people feel it on a personal level more than they might
sw3950A-ms98-a-0046 226.302750 232.426875 um on a on a global level you know just being informed about what other countries and
sw3950A-ms98-a-0047 232.426875 234.702625 other cultures are doing
sw3950A-ms98-a-0048 234.702625 241.833500 in a way that we might have not been informed before but yet politically uh their activities aren't aren't 
sw3950A-ms98-a-0049 241.833500 244.663750 influencing how our leaders direct
sw3950A-ms98-a-0050 244.663750 248.388375 legislation as as much as they could
sw3950A-ms98-a-0051 248.388375 251.640750 it's still really focused on our interests you know what i mean
sw3950A-ms98-a-0052 251.640750 253.333750 [laughter]
sw3950A-ms98-a-0053 253.333750 257.382750 [silence]
sw3950A-ms98-a-0054 257.382750 259.037250 uh-huh
sw3950A-ms98-a-0055 259.037250 262.047125 [silence]
sw3950A-ms98-a-0056 262.047125 264.691500 uh-huh uh-huh
sw3950A-ms98-a-0057 264.691500 266.517750 yeah
sw3950A-ms98-a-0058 266.517750 268.711250 McDonald's uh
sw3950A-ms98-a-0059 268.711250 270.530375 burning up the uh
sw3950A-ms98-a-0060 270.530375 282.940125 the rain forests in order to have more cattle grazing so that [laughter] somehow that's something that's not going to work out in the long term in that kind of a cycle it's going to catch up to us at some point
sw3950A-ms98-a-0061 282.940125 285.688250 [silence]
sw3950A-ms98-a-0062 285.688250 297.510125 what else has changed social changes uh i think that there's probably a greater awareness sensitivity on the part of men and women to to what the other
sw3950A-ms98-a-0063 297.510125 300.162000 um is adjusting to in life
