sw3908B-ms98-a-0003 12.507250 21.682875 well i think one of the major changes is the whole attitude towards women in the work place and the role of women in doing jobs outside of the home
sw3908B-ms98-a-0004 21.682875 25.860125 that's probably even one of the major changes i see over the last period of time
sw3908B-ms98-a-0005 25.860125 43.588000 [silence]
sw3908B-ms98-a-0006 43.588000 57.398125 oh i don't think so i think it's come a long ways in terms of giving them equal opportunities but i still think in lots of job markets they're not treated as equals in the words in some in some respects the other direction that in some job markets they really don't wanna be treated as equals
sw3908B-ms98-a-0007 57.398125 65.628375 [silence]
sw3908B-ms98-a-0008 65.628375 75.114750 yes i think that's generally speaking pretty true and i think that's what we really ought to look at that going is if they're gonna do equal work they ought to get equal pay
sw3908B-ms98-a-0009 75.114750 82.177000 and that uh they ought to have equal opportunities to advance to those positions and i don't think we've gotten there yet
sw3908B-ms98-a-0010 82.177000 88.069250 [silence]
sw3908B-ms98-a-0011 88.069250 90.829250 oh boy
sw3908B-ms98-a-0012 90.829250 100.608375 i think it's generally that switch over and i and i think that switch over has been more in the work force i don't think that women are treated as equals in the home as much as they are in the work force
sw3908B-ms98-a-0013 100.608375 113.250750 i think those women who are out working are probably still expected to carry more responsibility at home that the husband's having them on the other side of that coin picked up as much responsibility at home so they have one and three quarters jobs now
sw3908B-ms98-a-0014 113.250750 115.840125 whereas the husbands have one and a quarter
sw3908B-ms98-a-0015 115.840125 126.115625 [silence]
sw3908B-ms98-a-0016 126.115625 127.523625 yeah
sw3908B-ms98-a-0017 127.523625 147.460750 [silence]
sw3908B-ms98-a-0018 147.460750 157.541250 yes yeah and i think also in terms of parenting i think there's gonna be some increasing problem because_1 i think women are expecting husbands to do more parenting and i'm not sure they're becoming any more skilled at it
sw3908B-ms98-a-0019 157.541250 161.701250 because_1 i think it really has put some add[itional]- additional stresses on family units
sw3908B-ms98-a-0020 161.701250 166.512000 [silence]
sw3908B-ms98-a-0021 166.512000 167.483750 [noise]
sw3908B-ms98-a-0022 167.483750 168.484125 [silence]
sw3908B-ms98-a-0023 168.484125 175.776250 well i- i think one of the things that always happens is i think we'll swing to one end whereas you know where were moving at to the end where a lot of women will be at work
sw3908B-ms98-a-0024 175.776250 188.653000 and then i think we starting to see now some tendency of women at [vocalized-noise] mid thirties and so i was saying you know this career thing isn't all it's cracked up to be and i wanna go back and do something else so i think we'll probably see this [swind/swing] pendulum in terms of the work force swing back a little bit
sw3908B-ms98-a-0025 188.653000 194.300875 although so much of it's driven by economics right now people have gotten out and gotten use to two incomes coming in
sw3908B-ms98-a-0026 194.300875 201.765625 [silence]
sw3908B-ms98-a-0027 201.765625 202.995125 yeah
sw3908B-ms98-a-0028 202.995125 207.975250 [silence]
sw3908B-ms98-a-0029 207.975250 221.501375 well i think they ought to have the right i- i have some problems with my own family thinking about my wife [laughter-going] to com[bat]- and or my wife or my daughter's going into combat but i have problems with men doing that and i guess if they want to they ought to have the right to do it it's nothing i'd be greatly enthusiastic about pushing for
sw3908B-ms98-a-0030 221.501375 223.034750 [silence]

sw3908B-ms98-a-0035 250.721000 252.300125 i agree
sw3908B-ms98-a-0036 252.300125 255.839875 [silence]
sw3908B-ms98-a-0037 255.839875 264.030000 well i think one of the other things that concern has concerned me a little bit and i think i see some change in attitudes there my wife happens to be a wife who's chosen to stay at home
sw3908B-ms98-a-0038 264.030000 274.484500 and there's a a te[ndency]- has been a tendency over the past few years to treat her as though she was somebody who didn't have much intelligence because if she did she'd be out in the work force uh and fulfilling herself
sw3908B-ms98-a-0039 274.484500 284.335000 [silence]
sw3908B-ms98-a-0040 284.335000 292.959750 and i hope we reach the point where whatever w[omen]- women chose to do that's acceptable if they chose to go into the work force that's okay if they choose not to that's acceptable
sw3908B-ms98-a-0041 292.959750 294.320500 [silence]
sw3908B-ms98-a-0042 294.320500 296.013125 as equals
