sw3985B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.584500 [noise]
sw3985B-ms98-a-0002 0.584500 7.585750 [silence]
sw3985B-ms98-a-0003 7.585750 9.488375 well i own a company
sw3985B-ms98-a-0004 9.488375 12.466750 i'm the president and CEO of the company
sw3985B-ms98-a-0005 12.466750 16.095750 so uh i guess uh i determine what the benefits are
sw3985B-ms98-a-0006 16.095750 20.864750 [laughter]
sw3985B-ms98-a-0007 20.864750 26.047750 but uh y[ou]- so what are you asking me what [vocalized-noise] what benefits i think are most important
sw3985B-ms98-a-0008 26.047750 33.774625 [silence]
sw3985B-ms98-a-0009 33.774625 44.483250 um i'd say in today's economy uh besides basic benefits uh such as um health insurance and life insurance and the uh some type of retirement plan
sw3985B-ms98-a-0010 44.483250 48.430750 i'd say that uh most of the employees uh um
sw3985B-ms98-a-0011 48.430750 52.602500 that we have really like a a profit sharing plan
sw3985B-ms98-a-0012 52.602500 54.542250 [silence]
sw3985B-ms98-a-0013 54.542250 62.440250 they like to participate in the profits of the company like they're p[art]- like you know because they feel like well we're contributing to it so we'd like to participate in it
sw3985B-ms98-a-0014 62.440250 70.428625 and so that means i make a little bit less but the thing is that really you make a little more because everybody has a interest in in it working
sw3985B-ms98-a-0015 70.428625 76.983000 [silence]
sw3985B-ms98-a-0016 76.983000 78.203125 right
sw3985B-ms98-a-0017 78.203125 86.305375 i think most people uh don't want money um it's been my experience most people want uh to feel like they're participating in something that uh
sw3985B-ms98-a-0018 86.305375 91.598000 that is not a drudgery you know that they ca[n]- enjoy and that they can get some benefits out of
sw3985B-ms98-a-0019 91.598000 93.093125 right
sw3985B-ms98-a-0020 93.093125 124.028000 [silence]
sw3985B-ms98-a-0021 124.028000 129.675500 yeah well uh our people get a lot of satisfaction um we're a financial planning firm
sw3985B-ms98-a-0022 129.675500 136.769875 uh yes so you said you retired i just happen to have a person that i happened to do some planning for this morning but anyway uh
sw3985B-ms98-a-0023 136.769875 142.089625 uh we do we deal with a lot of people that are uh retired or trying to
sw3985B-ms98-a-0024 142.089625 144.314250 retire [laughter]
sw3985B-ms98-a-0025 144.314250 152.373625 and uh it's real important uh that their benefit plans that they get from their companies and from their work that where they were that uh
sw3985B-ms98-a-0026 152.373625 158.052375 um that it take care of them_1 they don't none of them_1 really want to be rich but they like to have enough to be comfortable
sw3985B-ms98-a-0027 158.052375 169.460625 [silence]
sw3985B-ms98-a-0028 169.460625 176.109000 well um we considering instead of tying a profit sharing plan to a a salary
sw3985B-ms98-a-0029 176.109000 179.033625 is uh is tie um
sw3985B-ms98-a-0030 179.033625 181.523000 uh a percentage
sw3985B-ms98-a-0031 181.523000 187.510625 um of business that uh that a person would participate and bring into the company
sw3985B-ms98-a-0032 187.510625 194.162375 uh pay them uh based on the percentage of business they bring instead of based on their salary and the re[sult]-
sw3985B-ms98-a-0033 194.162375 199.945125 [silence]
sw3985B-ms98-a-0034 199.945125 206.562000 no not necessarily um it can be in house people who help you handle X amount of dollars
sw3985B-ms98-a-0035 206.562000 208.980750 [silence]
sw3985B-ms98-a-0036 208.980750 214.377875 right well see we have diff[erent]- we have marketing people and then we have uh financial planners 
sw3985B-ms98-a-0037 214.377875 219.054125 and uh then we have uh staff secretaries and administrative assistants
sw3985B-ms98-a-0038 219.054125 230.549875 and these secretaries and administrative assistants um you know th[at]- if we don't have their cooperation and they're not participating in the profit of the company they they can get very dissatisfied very quickly
sw3985B-ms98-a-0039 230.549875 236.684625 and so uh we're thinking about paying them instead of a percentage on salary paying them a percentage on the business they handle so
sw3985B-ms98-a-0040 236.684625 244.543625 administrative assistant that would handle two million dollars worth of business is a lot more valuable than a person that handles a hundred thousand dollars worth of business
sw3985B-ms98-a-0041 244.543625 246.117625 and uh
sw3985B-ms98-a-0042 246.117625 255.250875 [silence]
sw3985B-ms98-a-0043 255.250875 261.989500 well and an[d]- and but to see the thing is that they give support to the financial planner that they're the assistant to
sw3985B-ms98-a-0044 261.989500 267.266875 or that they usually have several people they report to that you know that they work together with
sw3985B-ms98-a-0045 267.266875 270.645625 uh it encourages them not to uh complain
sw3985B-ms98-a-0046 270.645625 279.284250 when they realize that they get a part of the of the action based on their efforts not based on being sitting back saying well make me do it 
sw3985B-ms98-a-0047 279.284250 284.657875 see we don't want anybody around here that says make me do it i don't think anybo[dy]- any i think most people want to be
sw3985B-ms98-a-0048 284.657875 295.148125 lack a better termi[nology]- terminology they want to be self employed but they don't want to take the risk in other words they like to control their own future but they also want to be somewhat content to go and come as they please
sw3985B-ms98-a-0049 295.148125 298.754000 without some real strict adherence which that's what we have
