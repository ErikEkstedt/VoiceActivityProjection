sw3924A-ms98-a-0004 3.508125 12.340250 AIDS research is something that that i think th[at]- whether our country is putting enough money into it and actually i'm concerned that they're not
sw3924A-ms98-a-0005 12.340250 25.983125 i have a friend who is working with uh who works with uh travel groups and one of the ones that he's w[orked]- worked with was professionals who came in for an AIDS uh conference in uh California
sw3924A-ms98-a-0006 25.983125 29.647250 and these were from other people from other countries he's a translator
sw3924A-ms98-a-0007 29.647250 40.236500 and in talking to the people from France he said you know he says one of the things that really concerns me is your government's not telling you enough about how pervasive and frightening this epidemic is
sw3924A-ms98-a-0008 40.236500 44.966875 and they're letting the information out slowly about how
sw3924A-ms98-a-0009 44.966875 58.750875 you know how big it is which is scary you know it's pretty scary when so many people get it so i guess i'm i'm i'd like to see us spend more i don't know that spending more always gets it
sw3924A-ms98-a-0010 58.750875 75.173625 [silence]
sw3924A-ms98-a-0011 75.173625 79.861125 you mean more money for that means less for cancer or y[eah]- yeah

sw3924A-ms98-a-0015 101.368875 112.797625 well it i i agree with you there because i know every time that i[t]- i[t]- something comes into vogue all the money goes to that one and you don't know whether it's still also going to the other or if it's a limited pie
sw3924A-ms98-a-0016 112.797625 114.283125 money from
sw3924A-ms98-a-0017 114.283125 122.786250 money for taking care of the infants takes money away from taking care of the elderly or do they both get served uh that's a good point
sw3924A-ms98-a-0018 122.786250 139.661375 [silence]

sw3924A-ms98-a-0023 158.747375 169.289000 well and one of the things i'd and i'm with you that i don't know is is that really the only way it's being transmitted or was that the easier way to tell us and we're going to find out more
sw3924A-ms98-a-0024 169.289000 171.523625 uh that's that's the part that
sw3924A-ms98-a-0025 171.523625 172.664875 [laughter]
sw3924A-ms98-a-0026 172.664875 185.072750 that's the part that scares me you know i mean beginning with this is this is just for homosexuals well no it's for homosexuals and gays well no actually it's i mean you know did they know that all along
sw3924A-ms98-a-0027 185.072750 197.735000 [silence]
sw3924A-ms98-a-0028 197.735000 199.617750 [laughter-oh]
sw3924A-ms98-a-0029 199.617750 204.585250 [silence]
sw3924A-ms98-a-0030 204.585250 206.034750 right [laughter]
sw3924A-ms98-a-0031 206.034750 208.697500 [silence]
sw3924A-ms98-a-0032 208.697500 214.366125 and how is it really transmitted et cetera which is i think what they also don't know
sw3924A-ms98-a-0033 214.366125 224.221750 i mean that's i think they they told us what was convenient and felt safe to say you know it was nice to isolate it to one particular community that they have trouble
sw3924A-ms98-a-0034 224.221750 229.128125 you know they just as soon not approve of anyway but but that isn't how it was in Africa
sw3924A-ms98-a-0035 229.128125 242.230875 in Africa was the men and women and and had nothing to do with that and it's huge over there so i i you know and it's beginning to other countries that's was his point this was an international conference
sw3924A-ms98-a-0036 242.230875 251.232750 where people are saying well but in my country it's you know like this and does that mean like flus
sw3924A-ms98-a-0037 251.232750 253.730375 i mean i don't know [laughter]
sw3924A-ms98-a-0038 253.730375 259.945500 all i'm saying is i think it's scarier than we know uh or maybe they understand but
sw3924A-ms98-a-0039 259.945500 263.939750 [silence]
sw3924A-ms98-a-0040 263.939750 277.836500 yeah and uh and then the people that have it it does seem that there are are some drugs that are there that you know they keep holding back if you if i were dying i'm not sure i would care
sw3924A-ms98-a-0041 277.836500 279.017375 [silence]
sw3924A-ms98-a-0042 279.017375 287.939125 [laughter-yeah] [laughter-right] [laughter] i'll take anything you know i mean if i'm dying if i know i'm dying you can experiment on me go ahead
sw3924A-ms98-a-0043 287.939125 292.385875 [silence]
