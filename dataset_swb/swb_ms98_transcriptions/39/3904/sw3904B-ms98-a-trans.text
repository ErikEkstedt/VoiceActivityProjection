sw3904B-ms98-a-0037 200.141375 204.006625 [laughter-so] i don't know maybe it was uh
sw3904B-ms98-a-0038 204.006625 212.754625 who knows but anyway this weather here is is certainly evolved from a from a dryer hotter uh nineteen eighty
sw3904B-ms98-a-0039 212.754625 218.686000 to uh the pre[sent]- the the last summer we had i think we barely what cleared a hundred
sw3904B-ms98-a-0040 218.686000 220.454750 [silence]
sw3904B-ms98-a-0041 220.454750 223.051000 i think that was stretching it
sw3904B-ms98-a-0042 223.051000 226.384625 [silence]
sw3904B-ms98-a-0043 226.384625 234.724625 oh well believe you me i'm not not advocating cold summers no no no no no no no wrong wrong wrong but uh
sw3904B-ms98-a-0044 234.724625 245.941250 uh the summer of nineteen eighty we saw one hundred fifteen and one hundred sixteen and i was running a little heating and air-conditioning business at the time
sw3904B-ms98-a-0045 245.941250 248.176375 [silence]

sw3904B-ms98-a-0047 250.072375 262.046250 what happened there was that most of our cu[stomer]- everybody's customers uh down here about April start to call call every[body]- you know call their their local guys
sw3904B-ms98-a-0048 262.046250 265.454750 and we go out and tune up the systems
sw3904B-ms98-a-0049 265.454750 272.936500 and we are normally expecting some a hundred hundred degree days so we tune for that
sw3904B-ms98-a-0050 272.936500 277.867375 so we had everybody nice in tune when the hundred and fifteen degree weather hit
sw3904B-ms98-a-0051 277.867375 282.936625 and so w[hat]- the only thing that got replaced were the weak systems
sw3904B-ms98-a-0052 282.936625 294.781875 you know that would barely make it at one hundred but when the hundred and fifteen degree days hit well it just couldn't couldn't handle the load and they then they then the compressors blew like popcorn
sw3904B-ms98-a-0053 294.781875 298.850000 i mean just this pop pop bang bang [noise]
