sw3921B-ms98-a-0017 46.671125 55.677625 then uh we moved to uh South Dakota and uh did a lot of walleye fishing on the Missouri River
sw3921B-ms98-a-0018 55.677625 67.340000 and uh now that we are down here i think a lot of people do uh some bass fishing and striped bass fishing but uh i still uh i'm sort of a catfish man at heart 
sw3921B-ms98-a-0019 67.340000 74.914500 [silence]

sw3921B-ms98-a-0035 136.886125 149.413375 and you're right i i mean i like to fish for trout and they are really uh uh good fighters but uh if i went to a restaurant that probably wouldn't be the first thing i would order if i had a choice of fish on the menu 
sw3921B-ms98-a-0036 149.413375 154.070000 [silence]

sw3921B-ms98-a-0046 180.411375 189.602750 well that's how we do it too uh although we uh use to set some uh trout lines out and we've caught you know
sw3921B-ms98-a-0047 189.602750 196.673750 fourteen fifteen pound catfish and sometimes those are good to uh do on a barbecue grill
sw3921B-ms98-a-0048 196.673750 204.883625 and just uh leave the skin on and uh do it with uh butter on uh on an on tin foil 
sw3921B-ms98-a-0049 204.883625 210.968500 and then the skin just basically scrapes right off and uh we're and it really tastes pretty good
sw3921B-ms98-a-0050 210.968500 215.661875 [silence]
sw3921B-ms98-a-0051 215.661875 217.196375 there uh

sw3921B-ms98-a-0055 221.958625 232.314000 well i'm hoping one of these days i'll have the opportunity to catch a big catfish like that on uh a rod and reel but uh so far it's just been on uh on the trout lines so 
sw3921B-ms98-a-0056 232.314000 233.978375 [silence]
sw3921B-ms98-a-0057 233.978375 235.453125 yeah

sw3921B-ms98-a-0059 238.211500 249.327250 yeah and uh well and up in uh South Dakota on the in the Missouri River there we've uh tied into a few northern pike and uh
sw3921B-ms98-a-0060 249.327250 258.145625 they really uh i[n]- in the in when the water is cold they are very slow moving fish but in the summer time they'll uh give you a run for your money 
sw3921B-ms98-a-0061 258.145625 263.441375 [silence]
sw3921B-ms98-a-0062 263.441375 265.361000 uh-huh yeah

sw3921B-ms98-a-0064 266.952375 268.224750 in
sw3921B-ms98-a-0065 268.224750 270.005000 in Nebraska
sw3921B-ms98-a-0066 270.005000 278.751875 uh yeah most of the time uh we just fished uh in the river although there were a lot of sand pits and things like that that we could fish in
sw3921B-ms98-a-0067 278.751875 289.303125 and uh a lot of them ended up being close to the river so if the river ever uh flooded you know then obviously they'd dump some catfish and 
sw3921B-ms98-a-0068 289.303125 293.857875 bass and stuff into the into the ponds and the sand pits and 
sw3921B-ms98-a-0069 293.857875 297.218625 so we'd do a lot of fishing there too but uh
sw3921B-ms98-a-0070 297.218625 300.290000 South Dakota didn't really have much for
