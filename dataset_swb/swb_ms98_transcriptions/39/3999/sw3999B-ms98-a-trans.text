sw3999B-ms98-a-0017 108.332125 117.805875 it was constantly giving me valve problems i had this constant ticking of the valves and uh i switched over to Chrysler
sw3999B-ms98-a-0018 117.805875 118.992375 Plymouth
sw3999B-ms98-a-0019 118.992375 121.652875 and i haven't had a lick of problem

sw3999B-ms98-a-0028 155.004875 163.873000 well i found out they're pretty good whenever uh especially on weather like we're having today and and uh the roads are so slippery
sw3999B-ms98-a-0029 163.873000 167.584750 the antilock brakes are one of the better ones to have
sw3999B-ms98-a-0030 167.584750 176.709375 [silence]
sw3999B-ms98-a-0031 176.709375 177.788125 um-hum

sw3999B-ms98-a-0033 183.913125 186.174125 my daughter has a
sw3999B-ms98-a-0034 186.174125 193.696000 Civic Honda and that's a real comfortable car to sit in yeah which surprised me
sw3999B-ms98-a-0035 193.696000 199.054125 i have a Chrysler now i just bought and uh it's real comfortable
sw3999B-ms98-a-0036 199.054125 207.445375 and i'm very happy with it but Chrysler has a good warranty that they have to stand behind so i haven't had any
sw3999B-ms98-a-0037 207.445375 213.553625 worries about that that's one thing i go for in a car is their warranty and uh
sw3999B-ms98-a-0038 213.553625 222.773750 what does and doesn't come under that warrantee but they have the seven thou[sand]- uh seven thou[sand]- seventy thousand miles or seven years i believe 
sw3999B-ms98-a-0039 222.773750 226.739500 and uh bumper to bumper and i have no complaints
sw3999B-ms98-a-0040 226.739500 227.754875 [silence]
sw3999B-ms98-a-0041 227.754875 229.762750 so far with mine
sw3999B-ms98-a-0042 229.762750 233.164000 [silence]
sw3999B-ms98-a-0043 233.164000 234.676000 i sure would
sw3999B-ms98-a-0044 234.676000 238.924250 Dodge Plymouth Chrysler something in that line

sw3999B-ms98-a-0052 271.737000 278.744000 well that's another fallacy because uh so many people say that's a requirement has to be American
sw3999B-ms98-a-0053 278.744000 285.765875 but uh did you know that my Chrysler has foreign parts in it and so does Chevy and so does Ford
sw3999B-ms98-a-0054 285.765875 294.678375 so um i often hear people saying well i want to buy American or i like the foreign something and uh
