sw3999A-ms98-a-0004 8.107500 16.575750 [silence]
sw3999A-ms98-a-0005 16.575750 20.744750 uh i'm interested primarily in reliability

sw3999A-ms98-a-0010 33.623375 40.169125 well uh let me give you a little history on that i d[rove]- i drove uh GM cars for a long time
sw3999A-ms98-a-0011 40.169125 51.719750 and in fact i had a a Chevrolet and it ended up cost[ing]- it was only about five or six years old and i was paying on the average a hundred dollars a month in repair bills on that thing
sw3999A-ms98-a-0012 51.719750 58.558500 and i just couldn't handle that so i took a deep breath and bought a Toyota
sw3999A-ms98-a-0013 58.558500 68.648625 and have lived happily ever after [laughter-since] then [laughter-yes] yes i've had two small problems neither one of which left me by the side of the road
sw3999A-ms98-a-0014 68.648625 76.347875 uh with the Toyota in the last five years and and when i was buying that i was concerned primarily with re[liability]- reliability
sw3999A-ms98-a-0015 76.347875 79.165875 and but i also wanted a hatchback
sw3999A-ms98-a-0016 79.165875 83.495000 because you know y[ou]- you sometimes you have to carry bags of fertilizer
