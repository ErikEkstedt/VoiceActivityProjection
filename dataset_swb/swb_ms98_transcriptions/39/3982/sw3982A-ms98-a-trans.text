sw3982A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 6.876250 [noise] well Wendy have you had any uh experiences with your nieces in school to indicate that something's wrong with the school system
sw3982A-ms98-a-0002 6.876250 11.870625 [silence]
sw3982A-ms98-a-0003 11.870625 13.425250 uh-huh
sw3982A-ms98-a-0004 13.425250 31.474000 [silence]
sw3982A-ms98-a-0005 31.474000 37.182750 yeah do you think that's the fault of the school system or society or
sw3982A-ms98-a-0006 37.182750 44.766750 [silence] 
sw3982A-ms98-a-0007 44.766750 46.209375 yeah
sw3982A-ms98-a-0008 46.209375 53.104500 [silence]
sw3982A-ms98-a-0009 53.104500 54.765750 yes [laughter]
sw3982A-ms98-a-0010 54.765750 65.360500 [silence]
sw3982A-ms98-a-0011 65.360500 66.821500 yeah
sw3982A-ms98-a-0012 66.821500 70.706875 so it's really no more a failure of society
sw3982A-ms98-a-0013 70.706875 74.096000 [silence]
sw3982A-ms98-a-0014 74.096000 77.227875 [laughter]
sw3982A-ms98-a-0015 77.227875 78.593625 no
sw3982A-ms98-a-0016 78.593625 83.719250 [silence]
sw3982A-ms98-a-0017 83.719250 90.287375 i have a friend who's a principal of a Dallas school [laughter] the stories she tells oh yes
sw3982A-ms98-a-0018 90.287375 92.018000 with[in]-
sw3982A-ms98-a-0019 92.018000 93.532125 [silence]
sw3982A-ms98-a-0020 93.532125 103.291000 [noise] well the neighborhood that she's in is is very economically deprived and that is reflected in the students abilities i mean they have no support at home
sw3982A-ms98-a-0021 103.291000 112.111750 so for if you casually looked at it you could say maybe the test scores in that school are bad and and therefore there's a failure of the public school system
sw3982A-ms98-a-0022 112.111750 117.683125 but when the parents are not interested or don't have the resources or
sw3982A-ms98-a-0023 117.683125 120.305875 can't even read themselves [laughter]
sw3982A-ms98-a-0024 120.305875 125.097000 that sort of thing it it's bound to affect the education of the children
sw3982A-ms98-a-0025 125.097000 130.584625 [silence]
sw3982A-ms98-a-0026 130.584625 133.084875 oh well [laughter]
sw3982A-ms98-a-0027 133.084875 134.212875 [silence]
sw3982A-ms98-a-0028 134.212875 137.309750 [noise] i just wonder where all the money goes i mean my
sw3982A-ms98-a-0029 137.309750 137.754625 [noise]
sw3982A-ms98-a-0030 137.754625 140.302375 my taxes are exorbitant
sw3982A-ms98-a-0031 140.302375 151.322500 and [laughter] i- i- i don't think you solve problems too much by throwing money at it i think you have to get the parents interested and have to get the community support and that sort of thing
sw3982A-ms98-a-0032 151.322500 165.726125 [silence]
sw3982A-ms98-a-0033 165.726125 168.681875 oh i'm sure it is i'm sure it is
sw3982A-ms98-a-0034 168.681875 171.755000 [silence]
sw3982A-ms98-a-0035 171.755000 178.803500 well yes and if you don't develop an interest in reading at an early age it gets [laughter-awfully] [laughter-hard] [laughter-a] [laughter-lot] [laughter-later] [laughter-on]
sw3982A-ms98-a-0036 178.803500 181.878375 [silence]
sw3982A-ms98-a-0037 181.878375 191.358500 that's right but again society's uh influences i think can affect how well the students perform more than this than what the public school is or is not doing
sw3982A-ms98-a-0038 191.358500 197.087125 i mean certainly [vocalized-noise] drugs and and peer pressures of that sort
sw3982A-ms98-a-0039 197.087125 203.856750 can again make the students fail and therefore look like that there's some[thing]- something deficient about the public school system
sw3982A-ms98-a-0040 203.856750 212.419625 [silence]
sw3982A-ms98-a-0041 212.419625 214.433625 [laughter]
sw3982A-ms98-a-0042 214.433625 216.473500 isn't that scary
sw3982A-ms98-a-0043 216.473500 220.005000 [silence]
sw3982A-ms98-a-0044 220.005000 221.103750 [laughter]
sw3982A-ms98-a-0045 221.103750 234.781750 [silence]
sw3982A-ms98-a-0046 234.781750 240.726000 that's right but then then again that's something that that's very difficult for the schools to try to control
sw3982A-ms98-a-0047 240.726000 250.265250 this principal i know does the best she can in terms of dealing with students this is a grade school students who are members of gangs
sw3982A-ms98-a-0048 250.265250 254.036750 yes students who carry weapons to [laughter-school]
sw3982A-ms98-a-0049 254.036750 270.787875 [silence]
sw3982A-ms98-a-0050 270.787875 272.209125 oh yeah
sw3982A-ms98-a-0051 272.209125 275.828250 [silence]
sw3982A-ms98-a-0052 275.828250 277.724250 [laughter-that's] right
sw3982A-ms98-a-0053 277.724250 283.460750 [silence]
sw3982A-ms98-a-0054 283.460750 291.022500 that's right but when there are disruptive influences like that in the school i think it makes it especially difficult for the children who want to learn
sw3982A-ms98-a-0055 291.022500 299.138000 [silence]
