sw3945B-ms98-a-0032 202.754500 206.844750 [noise]
sw3945B-ms98-a-0033 206.844750 207.949875 w[hat]-
sw3945B-ms98-a-0034 207.949875 213.847375 i- i think it's a i- i don't know i- i think i think it's like private like you said privatization is good because
sw3945B-ms98-a-0035 213.847375 227.762875 you know when the pr[ofit]- uh one good thing that could be said for the profit motive is people aren't going to run a business at a loss i happen to work for a city for the City of New York and uh that's the attitude that uh at least my agency takes
sw3945B-ms98-a-0036 227.762875 231.979500 you know they they w[hen]- they take the attitude that uh this is a business
sw3945B-ms98-a-0037 231.979500 245.908125 and and if you're not going to run it profitably then you're going to be out of business because they are going to privatize it so in that sense you know at my agency a[nd]- and it's unique i think for government agencies is revenue producing
sw3945B-ms98-a-0038 245.908125 250.013500 and we make more money than we than we cost so uh
sw3945B-ms98-a-0039 250.013500 259.550000 so nobody's ever going to question my salary or anybody else on my staff uh especially my unit because my unit is a revenue producing unit uh there are other
sw3945B-ms98-a-0040 259.550000 264.943250 you know things that that may i mean look at that i was talking to my father the other day about the NASA program
sw3945B-ms98-a-0041 264.943250 276.992500 you know he thought it was kind of ridiculous we spend all this money to send these rocket ships up into space and stuff but yet then again they come up with all these scientific discoveries that may help save us sometime i mean i think it was NASA
sw3945B-ms98-a-0042 276.992500 283.055125 yeah you do learn a lot so you're not you you know you're paying all this money but you're getting something back for it uh
sw3945B-ms98-a-0043 283.055125 291.461875 you know military spending is the same thing whether you agree or you disagree with building all these bombs and stuff which i happen to have a tendency to disagree with
sw3945B-ms98-a-0044 291.461875 299.298000 uh you know we are buying protection you know we are protecting ourselves from from uh from other countries that we may be afraid of whether it's right
