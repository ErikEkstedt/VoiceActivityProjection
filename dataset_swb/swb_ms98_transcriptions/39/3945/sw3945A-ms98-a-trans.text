sw3945A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.661500 [noise]
sw3945A-ms98-a-0002 0.661500 5.429125 taxes right you thi[nk]- you think you pay too much
sw3945A-ms98-a-0003 5.429125 9.214375 is what they said and do you think you'd get what you pay [laughter-for]
sw3945A-ms98-a-0004 9.214375 16.433875 [silence]
sw3945A-ms98-a-0005 16.433875 17.550875 yeah
sw3945A-ms98-a-0006 17.550875 45.228125 [silence]
sw3945A-ms98-a-0007 45.228125 47.409500 right
sw3945A-ms98-a-0008 47.409500 56.749500 well i really feel in some areas that uh i agree i don't think any of us like paying taxes i think in some areas we could do better in a private sector
sw3945A-ms98-a-0009 56.749500 66.357500 i think it just i've done some reading on this and so[me]- and in some of the areas you know you're lucky to get back a a dime on a dollar on some programs
sw3945A-ms98-a-0010 66.357500 77.888375 uh but i also know that people to me won't do what they should do to help each other and they wouldn't have so much government if we did
sw3945A-ms98-a-0011 77.888375 89.076750 and uh we get you know gets forced into it i think socialized medicine's coming which i hate to see but i think because there's so many people without insurance that's what's c[oming]- you know it's coming
sw3945A-ms98-a-0012 89.076750 90.534875 uh-huh
sw3945A-ms98-a-0013 90.534875 93.172000 so uh
sw3945A-ms98-a-0014 93.172000 100.581500 but no i don't probably feel like i get back what i pay now you do you pay state income tax in
sw3945A-ms98-a-0015 100.581500 103.219250 [silence]
sw3945A-ms98-a-0016 103.219250 112.448500 yeah see here a lot of people think in Texas we're lucky because_1 we don't pay um state income tax but they get us in other ways you know
sw3945A-ms98-a-0017 112.448500 128.382000 [silence]
sw3945A-ms98-a-0018 128.382000 131.337500 [noise] um yeah
sw3945A-ms98-a-0019 131.337500 137.524625 [silence]
sw3945A-ms98-a-0020 137.524625 138.797750 yeah
sw3945A-ms98-a-0021 138.797750 142.993250 [silence]
sw3945A-ms98-a-0022 142.993250 145.783750 i think that's another problem
sw3945A-ms98-a-0023 145.783750 153.788750 uh yeah well that's where they got us here you know every time they need something they up the quote user's fees or the sin taxes you know on beer and such
sw3945A-ms98-a-0024 153.788750 155.817125 [silence]
sw3945A-ms98-a-0025 155.817125 163.562500 yeah so just because we don't have a state income tax they get us proportionately higher in other areas
sw3945A-ms98-a-0026 163.562500 164.583375 [silence]
sw3945A-ms98-a-0027 164.583375 166.912500 so i don't know
sw3945A-ms98-a-0028 166.912500 168.403375 no
sw3945A-ms98-a-0029 168.403375 170.900625 [silence]
sw3945A-ms98-a-0030 170.900625 177.502625 they get it somewhere and and the problem is with that if you have a state income tax you can take it off you federal
sw3945A-ms98-a-0031 177.502625 183.303750 so we can't take our any of our sales taxes or anything off anymore because of the reform
sw3945A-ms98-a-0032 183.303750 190.900500 but that's what they up it they up it on gasoline they up it on um say beer and cigarettes uh
sw3945A-ms98-a-0033 190.900500 197.498750 user's fee driver's license license plates it all just keeps going up and up and up and they tell us it's not really taxes
sw3945A-ms98-a-0034 197.498750 200.538250 [laughter-you] [laughter-know] [laughter-you] [laughter-know] [laughter-but]
sw3945A-ms98-a-0035 200.538250 207.011500 it is and uh no i don't know i don't know what the answer is to all this i think uh
sw3945A-ms98-a-0036 207.011500 208.870500 i don't know
sw3945A-ms98-a-0037 208.870500 219.393375 [silence]
