sw3954B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.332875 [noise]
sw3954B-ms98-a-0002 1.332875 7.475125 i have uh just uh one dog she's a ten month old puppy um
sw3954B-ms98-a-0003 7.475125 17.665875 Cocker Spaniel and uh just has been real enjoyable although i think it's just as much work having a puppy around as it was a baby i think
sw3954B-ms98-a-0004 17.665875 25.039750 really at times i know i can just pick up and leave when i need to although you know which is one thing you can't do with a baby but
sw3954B-ms98-a-0005 25.039750 32.977625 um you know she's had to be potty trained and and the whole work and uh it's just been it's been nice though
sw3954B-ms98-a-0006 32.977625 43.653250 because_1 uh we used to have a an older dog and she died at about the the age eleven and was our first real baby as such because_1 we didn't have kids yet and uh
sw3954B-ms98-a-0007 43.653250 55.169500 so she was our pride and joy and when she she got sick and died it was kind of like an empty hole was in in our family because the gir[ls]- our two girls that we now have got real close to her and
sw3954B-ms98-a-0008 55.169500 61.680125 so it was um hard though to replace her i think it took us a couple of years before we replaced her
sw3954B-ms98-a-0009 61.680125 62.869500 [silence]
sw3954B-ms98-a-0010 62.869500 68.764750 yeah uh well we were in the middle of moving uh shortly afterwards anyway and
sw3954B-ms98-a-0011 68.764750 82.711375 we both just didn't feel my husband and i didn't feel like we could take on the the the time that it really takes to raise a dog right to the first you know few months of their life is just as important like it is a kid if you want a good dog afterwards and
sw3954B-ms98-a-0012 82.711375 92.110500 so we waited and it was about two years before we were emotionally ready to get back into that kind of uh [laughter] um realm of life so uh
sw3954B-ms98-a-0013 92.110500 95.752250 [silence]
sw3954B-ms98-a-0014 95.752250 97.274000 oh
sw3954B-ms98-a-0015 97.274000 100.938750 [silence]
sw3954B-ms98-a-0016 100.938750 102.423750 um-hum
sw3954B-ms98-a-0017 102.423750 103.736250 [silence]
sw3954B-ms98-a-0018 103.736250 105.166375 yeah
sw3954B-ms98-a-0019 105.166375 108.909750 [silence]
sw3954B-ms98-a-0020 108.909750 114.649750 um-hum um-hum well it takes our vet probably said
sw3954B-ms98-a-0021 114.649750 116.726500 seven to nine months
sw3954B-ms98-a-0022 116.726500 131.169750 uh is the real time you really want to put into them_1 for the training as far as the initial training and he said if you give them_1 just that much then the rest of their life with you is just going to be real nice and and
sw3954B-ms98-a-0023 131.169750 132.282875 [silence]
sw3954B-ms98-a-0024 132.282875 145.153875 no i never have um she could do better i'm sure on some things and um i know it's still not too late to do that if i really feel like i need to but i just need to give her time
sw3954B-ms98-a-0025 145.153875 155.059875 um you know working with her and i know how to do that pretty much on my own it's just a matter of disciplining myself on making sure we cover a few things but
sw3954B-ms98-a-0026 155.059875 165.414125 she knows the real basics she's potty trained and she uh comes when we call her and she'll roll over and she'll sit and she'll put her foot up to shake hands and
sw3954B-ms98-a-0027 165.414125 173.166750 yeah so i mean she can do some of the basic things that kind of are needed and some for just for frills and uh
sw3954B-ms98-a-0028 173.166750 183.612625 but i don't have her trained when it comes to staying real good yet and uh not real well about keeping her from jumping but i think some of that's just puppiness too
sw3954B-ms98-a-0029 183.612625 191.389000 that i'm i'm kind of working just waiting a little bit to make sure i don't push something too [vocalized-noise] too hard on her 
sw3954B-ms98-a-0030 191.389000 193.441625 [silence]
sw3954B-ms98-a-0031 193.441625 196.408125 yes yeah us[ually]-
sw3954B-ms98-a-0032 196.408125 208.500750 yeah [laughter] yeah just started doing it with little pieces of cheese and boy [vocalized-noise] the dogs really even at the age of ten i would just still be teaching them_1 new tricks just as long as you give them_1 something to
sw3954B-ms98-a-0033 208.500750 212.088625 to look forward to i mean they love the hugs and kisses but
sw3954B-ms98-a-0034 212.088625 216.786375 the the food really seems to meld it all together real fast and
sw3954B-ms98-a-0035 216.786375 217.818125 [silence]
sw3954B-ms98-a-0036 217.818125 222.933625 um i have for just bits and pieces i've never seemed to be
sw3954B-ms98-a-0037 222.933625 234.264000 too long with a cat when i was a kid they'd always run away [laughter] [laughter-a[nd]-] and then when i was a grown-up i was wi[th]- living in in an apartment as a a college student and uh
sw3954B-ms98-a-0038 234.264000 248.128500 then i got my own first and only cat and she was precious but when i needed to move back out and back to home i had to leave the cat behind so um i've never had a cat for very long but
sw3954B-ms98-a-0039 248.128500 252.011875 [silence]
sw3954B-ms98-a-0040 252.011875 253.563875 oh really
sw3954B-ms98-a-0041 253.563875 254.753125 [silence]
sw3954B-ms98-a-0042 254.753125 256.180125 uh-huh
sw3954B-ms98-a-0043 256.180125 257.338125 [silence]
sw3954B-ms98-a-0044 257.338125 260.274375 yeah [laughter] yeah
sw3954B-ms98-a-0045 260.274375 262.862375 [silence]
sw3954B-ms98-a-0046 262.862375 265.364625 that's right that's right
sw3954B-ms98-a-0047 265.364625 269.008500 [silence]

sw3954B-ms98-a-0049 270.415750 272.215250 [silence]
sw3954B-ms98-a-0050 272.215250 279.907000 [laughter] that's right that's right and cats do seem to have the roam the roam of the world so
sw3954B-ms98-a-0051 279.907000 282.432125 [silence]
sw3954B-ms98-a-0052 282.432125 284.685750 yeah yeah
sw3954B-ms98-a-0053 284.685750 296.620375 so um well i think you should go back and try to take in a dog again you could even go and adopt one that's already past puppyhood and uh if you're
sw3954B-ms98-a-0054 296.620375 300.482000 well no a friend of mine had puppies
