sw3995A-ms98-a-0037 124.385750 133.609625 my experience at camping is a little bit different um we do we do do a little family camping but [noise] i do a lot of elk hunting with uh bow and arrow elk and deer hunting
sw3995A-ms98-a-0038 133.609625 142.159875 and uh so i- i we go back into the mountains using horses and and uh g[o]- and we'll pack in sometimes as far as ten miles
sw3995A-ms98-a-0039 142.159875 146.140500 back in just on horseback and we'll stay for ten days and
sw3995A-ms98-a-0040 146.140500 156.089750 and that's a lot of fun but it's it's not real uh conducive to taking my wife uh she doesn't appreciate being away from civilization that long and
sw3995A-ms98-a-0041 156.089750 163.401125 and uh no electricity and no you know we you you take a bath in the creek and freeze to death while you're doing it but uh

sw3995A-ms98-a-0047 176.126625 177.517875 um but
sw3995A-ms98-a-0048 177.517875 188.209500 we'll probably go during the summertime on uh like a three-dayers probably two times and then as soon as fall comes on and the hunting season starts
sw3995A-ms98-a-0049 188.209500 197.056375 uh we usually get one big one and then one big one that'll last probably ten days and then one or two small ones for two or three days at a time
