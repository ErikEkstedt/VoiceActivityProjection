sw3987B-ms98-a-0009 42.022125 43.329000 uh-huh
sw3987B-ms98-a-0010 43.329000 44.710125 [silence]

sw3987B-ms98-a-0013 53.685125 55.100000 [silence]
sw3987B-ms98-a-0014 55.100000 57.718500 um-hum eighty four and eighty
sw3987B-ms98-a-0015 57.718500 60.256000 [laughter]
sw3987B-ms98-a-0016 60.256000 64.562750 yeah see eighty four one eighty four year old man that's in the hospital
sw3987B-ms98-a-0017 64.562750 74.004125 but uh we've been looking into it and uh course nursing homes i think uh you would find that uh you would want uh one close to home
sw3987B-ms98-a-0018 74.004125 77.479625 and one that has a pleasant surrounding
sw3987B-ms98-a-0019 77.479625 87.713625 and one that has good staff that uh you know will take care of you and treat you you know like a a like an individual
sw3987B-ms98-a-0020 87.713625 89.293875 and uh
sw3987B-ms98-a-0021 89.293875 99.201625 and look after your every needs i know down here in Texas we've had a lot of problems with nursing homes that uh that don't uh take care of their people
sw3987B-ms98-a-0022 99.201625 103.908000 they've gone in they've closed down a lot of them_1 and they put new regulations on some of them_1
sw3987B-ms98-a-0023 103.908000 110.126625 you go in you find an old person with a bed sore because they haven't been turned or haven't been cleaned
sw3987B-ms98-a-0024 110.126625 118.846250 so uh all of that uh you know i think someone needs to know uh about uh the qualifications of a nursing home
sw3987B-ms98-a-0025 118.846250 120.496125 and the staff
sw3987B-ms98-a-0026 120.496125 124.494250 [silence]
sw3987B-ms98-a-0027 124.494250 133.002250 well let's assume that uh you wanted to take your mother to a uh nursing home there locally in Ogden i'm sure you've got some that's close by
sw3987B-ms98-a-0028 133.002250 145.884375 it woul[d]- i[t]- what would be real nice is find one around the corner that you could visit that you could go in and uh talk to the people talk to some of the people's uh uh siblings
sw3987B-ms98-a-0029 145.884375 156.694000 or uh you know children children and uh find out how they like it you know course one of the most important things is is uh can you afford it
sw3987B-ms98-a-0030 156.694000 169.604250 and uh down in some small cities here in Texas it's about fifteen hundred dollars a month over here in Dallas it's closer to three thousand if you really wanna get super care you know you can pay anything you want to
sw3987B-ms98-a-0031 169.604250 180.605500 course we haven't even mentioned Medicaid uh which and uh which uh would take care of an individual who is destitute
sw3987B-ms98-a-0032 180.605500 186.708625 and course there's a lot to be said about uh making a member destitute
sw3987B-ms98-a-0033 186.708625 193.901875 as opposed to uh paying for it yourself because the government you know uh provides for a destitute person
sw3987B-ms98-a-0034 193.901875 206.924125 [silence]
sw3987B-ms98-a-0035 206.924125 208.432125 yeah
sw3987B-ms98-a-0036 208.432125 221.730750 [silence]
sw3987B-ms98-a-0037 221.730750 222.964750 yeah
sw3987B-ms98-a-0038 222.964750 224.006625 [silence]
sw3987B-ms98-a-0039 224.006625 231.743125 well yeah and that's true because uh after the year's gone all of her savings are going to be eaten up and if she owns her house uh
sw3987B-ms98-a-0040 231.743125 240.289875 i'm not sure about the total rules on the house but i assume that you'd have to sell the house and those proceeds would go to pay for the nursing home
sw3987B-ms98-a-0041 240.289875 243.729000 and anyway it's while it's unlawful
sw3987B-ms98-a-0042 243.729000 245.115500 um
sw3987B-ms98-a-0043 245.115500 249.886000 there's nothing wrong with a parent gifting everything she has to uh to
sw3987B-ms98-a-0044 249.886000 253.819125 uh to an individual like uh like like you
sw3987B-ms98-a-0045 253.819125 264.383125 and then uh from there on out uh saving that money uh so that uh you could supplement her income after she goes under Medicaid
sw3987B-ms98-a-0046 264.383125 266.122625 a lot of people do that
sw3987B-ms98-a-0047 266.122625 274.400625 and most one of the most important things uh about sending a person to uh the nursing home is is the burial provided for
sw3987B-ms98-a-0048 274.400625 283.589250 see that should be provided for before she ever goes out of her monies or otherwise you know the the uh the uh the kids have to provide that
sw3987B-ms98-a-0049 283.589250 286.393625 so uh you kn[ow]- i sure you've thought of all this
sw3987B-ms98-a-0050 286.393625 290.349875 [silence]
sw3987B-ms98-a-0051 290.349875 298.178000 oh yes it's very sad we had a discussion with her mother who is uh is eighty years old this past weekend and uh
