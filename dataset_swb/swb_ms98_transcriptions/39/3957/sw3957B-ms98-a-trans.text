sw3957B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.778000 [noise]
sw3957B-ms98-a-0002 0.778000 12.932000 [noise] well i feel like the major problem we have and the reason that crime has gotten so out of hand is because there isn't a punishment that's matching what's being done
sw3957B-ms98-a-0003 12.932000 23.768125 [noise] and i think it starts when the kids are little i think the parents in our community teach our children that as long as they can get away with something that it's all right
sw3957B-ms98-a-0004 23.768125 34.996625 because i don't see a lot of parents especially where i'm at i have a lot of the responsibility of what ever is done in our neighborhood because there's no other mothers at home
sw3957B-ms98-a-0005 34.996625 48.896750 and i see a lot of kids very small kids coming home to empty homes every day and doing all kinds of unbelievable things and as long as they don't let anybody know about it they get away with it [noise] so
sw3957B-ms98-a-0006 48.896750 61.598125 you know i feel like if our pa[rents]- mothers stayed home if we had that secure start you know where kids learned the right way to act um they were rewarded for their good behavior
sw3957B-ms98-a-0007 61.598125 67.195250 and they had a secure family that they came from i think we'd see a whole different society
sw3957B-ms98-a-0008 67.195250 81.181750 [silence]
sw3957B-ms98-a-0009 81.181750 82.815750 that's right
sw3957B-ms98-a-0010 82.815750 94.717375 [silence]
sw3957B-ms98-a-0011 94.717375 95.985750 yeah
sw3957B-ms98-a-0012 95.985750 101.652625 [silence]
sw3957B-ms98-a-0013 101.652625 102.943500 right
sw3957B-ms98-a-0014 102.943500 104.748750 [silence]
sw3957B-ms98-a-0015 104.748750 115.069250 [noise] well you know i did a survey on why mothers left their children to go to work [noise] and i found out that more than eighty percent of all the people i talked to
sw3957B-ms98-a-0016 115.069250 128.491625 the mothers went to work to provide a better life for their children and when i talked with their children their children wanted their parents home rather than the the material things they were getting 
sw3957B-ms98-a-0017 128.491625 129.798625 [silence]
sw3957B-ms98-a-0018 129.798625 134.650250 and it's just too bad that the parents won't listen to this survey
sw3957B-ms98-a-0019 134.650250 146.756125 so [noise] i just think that um another problem is i think the way the legal system has been set up that the criminals get out and the jails are so over crowded they can't handle punishing this the 
sw3957B-ms98-a-0020 146.756125 149.576250 people that are committing the bad crimes
sw3957B-ms98-a-0021 149.576250 158.038000 sufficiently i think they need to put more people out to death um if it's completely witnessed and it's uh seen that there's no
sw3957B-ms98-a-0022 158.038000 163.151250 you know i think there needs to be more severe punishment but it needs to be fair
sw3957B-ms98-a-0023 163.151250 166.827625 [silence]
sw3957B-ms98-a-0024 166.827625 168.320250 right i think that
sw3957B-ms98-a-0025 168.320250 174.649625 [silence]
sw3957B-ms98-a-0026 174.649625 177.051500 to oh out do it
sw3957B-ms98-a-0027 177.051500 180.376625 yeah or out do what's been done [noise]
sw3957B-ms98-a-0028 180.376625 187.164875 yeah i think that's another problem um i know that once when i was reading a book when i was studying history
sw3957B-ms98-a-0029 187.164875 193.367125 and it said you show me a country that can produce strong families and you'll have a strong country
sw3957B-ms98-a-0030 193.367125 201.681125 and if you look back over United States histories our country was strong until the mothers started leaving the home
sw3957B-ms98-a-0031 201.681125 205.502500 that's right [laughter]
sw3957B-ms98-a-0032 205.502500 211.240625 that's right and they do and then they grow up and it just continually will get worse
sw3957B-ms98-a-0033 211.240625 213.011375 [noise] so
sw3957B-ms98-a-0034 213.011375 219.217625 i guess what we both agree on is that families need to change their way of thinking [laughter]
sw3957B-ms98-a-0035 219.217625 222.916125 [silence]
sw3957B-ms98-a-0036 222.916125 235.008500 [noise] right and i think people need to have some sort of a an idea of why we're here and what we're doing and what we're working towards and why it's important to do these things rather than just getting ahead materialistically
sw3957B-ms98-a-0037 235.008500 237.845375 [silence]
sw3957B-ms98-a-0038 237.845375 246.880500 that's right [laughter] well um do they co[me]- do they come on and say when we've ta[lked]- visited for five minutes 
sw3957B-ms98-a-0039 246.880500 247.900500 [silence]
sw3957B-ms98-a-0040 247.900500 250.692625 this is your first time [laughter]
sw3957B-ms98-a-0041 250.692625 253.095875 [silence]
sw3957B-ms98-a-0042 253.095875 254.608375 um [noise]
sw3957B-ms98-a-0043 254.608375 267.114375 we discussed i discussed on here with someone um last week about the justice system and how it could be improved on juries and we discussed about how half the jury that they select to
sw3957B-ms98-a-0044 267.114375 274.642750 you know come up with the verdict if half of those were law students then they could understand what was going on in the court room
sw3957B-ms98-a-0045 274.642750 281.505875 and have the time that they spent in their jury district count towards some of their graduation hours
sw3957B-ms98-a-0046 281.505875 290.758875 [noise] wouldn't that be a good idea because_1 i think so sometimes the juries don't understand all this the legal you know talk and and what's going on
sw3957B-ms98-a-0047 290.758875 295.593750 [noise] and this way it would get people that were a little more knowledgeable at least half of them_1
sw3957B-ms98-a-0048 295.593750 299.458000 to be on that board or on the jury
