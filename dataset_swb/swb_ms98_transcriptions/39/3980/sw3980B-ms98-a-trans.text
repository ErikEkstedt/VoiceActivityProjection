sw3980B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 13.251500 hi hi i'm Joan [laughter] this is a riot [laughter] i- i'm making money what are you doing 
sw3980B-ms98-a-0002 13.251500 16.589875 push your one and let's get with it
sw3980B-ms98-a-0003 16.589875 19.182375 [silence]
sw3980B-ms98-a-0004 19.182375 27.288500 okay [vocalized-noise] so what do you think about raising kids you don't know anything about this
sw3980B-ms98-a-0005 27.288500 30.965750 it is kind of hard for you
sw3980B-ms98-a-0006 30.965750 34.383000 [silence]
sw3980B-ms98-a-0007 34.383000 35.970375 um-hum
sw3980B-ms98-a-0008 35.970375 41.408000 [silence]
sw3980B-ms98-a-0009 41.408000 43.493625 i do to
sw3980B-ms98-a-0010 43.493625 47.271750 [silence]
sw3980B-ms98-a-0011 47.271750 49.294250 that's true
sw3980B-ms98-a-0012 49.294250 54.380875 [silence]
sw3980B-ms98-a-0013 54.380875 66.582375 [laughter] right right but i- i think you need to take that for the little bit of time it takes like for or about
sw3980B-ms98-a-0014 66.582375 75.983625 ten years out of your life of really being around them_1 when they really need you and their younger ages it's worth that ten years and it pays off i think
sw3980B-ms98-a-0015 75.983625 83.103125 because_1 the ten years isn't long till you can work on your career and then you have forty years more to do your career
sw3980B-ms98-a-0016 83.103125 85.324000 [silence]
sw3980B-ms98-a-0017 85.324000 87.015250 yeah
sw3980B-ms98-a-0018 87.015250 88.635750 that's true
sw3980B-ms98-a-0019 88.635750 89.919375 [silence]
sw3980B-ms98-a-0020 89.919375 92.959125 that's true what well you know some of the um
sw3980B-ms98-a-0021 92.959125 98.569875 i see it with our teachers that have waited for it till they're thirty four thirty five
sw3980B-ms98-a-0022 98.569875 102.493250 and they have that first one and boy you'd think they were the only ones that ever had kids
sw3980B-ms98-a-0023 102.493250 104.859250 they and yeah they really love it
sw3980B-ms98-a-0024 104.859250 112.419125 i think they're kind of sorry then they didn't that they waited that long because_1 they really enjoy them a lot
sw3980B-ms98-a-0025 112.419125 123.925625 and i see that a lot with the young girls that think that's all they wanted was careers and then when they hit around thirty four thirty five they decide well the really want to try motherhood
sw3980B-ms98-a-0026 123.925625 132.609500 and uh that happens but i agree if they if they want a career though i think they should go with the career and forget the kids when
sw3980B-ms98-a-0027 132.609500 134.409375 yeah
sw3980B-ms98-a-0028 134.409375 137.146250 [silence]
sw3980B-ms98-a-0029 137.146250 140.225500 yeah right
sw3980B-ms98-a-0030 140.225500 149.644625 right are you at school now are you that's a riot [laughter-yes]
sw3980B-ms98-a-0031 149.644625 155.464500 um what are some of the things you think the parents should do with their kids
sw3980B-ms98-a-0032 155.464500 158.974750 [silence]
sw3980B-ms98-a-0033 158.974750 160.319625 right
sw3980B-ms98-a-0034 160.319625 164.544500 [silence]
sw3980B-ms98-a-0035 164.544500 171.931625 yeah see i think that dinner time is real important with kids that's when a lot of things would come out
sw3980B-ms98-a-0036 171.931625 181.632000 that if you and you'd make i know that when they're all going all different directions but i used to at least make three mea[ls]- three meals out of a week they had to be together
sw3980B-ms98-a-0037 181.632000 189.965000 and i kind of insist on it and they were pretty good about it they hated to miss it because_1 they'd hear about the good time we had if they weren't around
sw3980B-ms98-a-0038 189.965000 200.085750 yeah i do too because_1 that's when i don't know why but kids start talking when you're when you're around a dinner table and all they start telling all the things
sw3980B-ms98-a-0039 200.085750 201.578750 [silence]
sw3980B-ms98-a-0040 201.578750 203.499250 yeah
sw3980B-ms98-a-0041 203.499250 205.512375 [silence]
sw3980B-ms98-a-0042 205.512375 206.834250 yeah
sw3980B-ms98-a-0043 206.834250 214.838000 and uh but i think a[ny]- any entertainment that you can do with them_1 is fun though when when you know we always loved to go camping
sw3980B-ms98-a-0044 214.838000 220.674750 and that's great even even now we go camping in fact we have one set up in May
sw3980B-ms98-a-0045 220.674750 232.569625 and the grand kids come now it's the grand kids i mean we started out when the kids were young doing this and now they bring their babies um [noise] Mary's baby was four weeks old when we took her
sw3980B-ms98-a-0046 232.569625 241.207875 we took him and uh we start them_1 out real young even and in the winter we just take electric blankets and put them_1 on
sw3980B-ms98-a-0047 241.207875 244.955625 they and they love that outdoors
sw3980B-ms98-a-0048 244.955625 254.602125 yeah and they go fishing from the time they're little and uh the daddies take them_1 out in the boats it's fun
sw3980B-ms98-a-0049 254.602125 256.143625 yeah
sw3980B-ms98-a-0050 256.143625 260.697375 [silence]
sw3980B-ms98-a-0051 260.697375 265.027125 [laughter]
sw3980B-ms98-a-0052 265.027125 266.596000 yeah
sw3980B-ms98-a-0053 266.596000 277.233500 but i think any any outings with kids is wonderful makes you get to know them better and another thing i like is um just making sure you have time with each one alone
sw3980B-ms98-a-0054 277.233500 285.469000 yeah even you you know no matter how many you have you should take a special day a special time for one
sw3980B-ms98-a-0055 285.469000 299.138000 yeah and make that day for shopping or going out to lunch or just taking them_1 to the park alone and you'd be surprised what they'll talk about when you're just sitting there on a swing talking
