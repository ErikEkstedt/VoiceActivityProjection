sw3964B-ms98-a-0038 173.451375 182.560000 it is uh you you can have a motor on it and and a lot of them do i uh just because if you get out [laughter-there] and there's no wind it's pretty hard to get back
sw3964B-ms98-a-0039 182.560000 193.951000 i find it very relaxing i i think they're they're absolutely beautiful i you know i really as i say would like to learn to do it myself just got turned off early on by
sw3964B-ms98-a-0040 193.951000 203.141375 a particular manner but um it's a wonderful feeling my son and and a[nd]- can sail and he and i have gone out
sw3964B-ms98-a-0041 203.141375 214.989500 but he likes to cut it right right to the [laughter] when you're going along with the wind you you you can get you can decide how much you want to heel and he loves to take it as far over as possible
sw3964B-ms98-a-0042 214.989500 216.135375 i find that

sw3964B-ms98-a-0044 217.901125 220.648625 yeah the closer to the wind you are
sw3964B-ms98-a-0045 220.648625 224.252750 then you've seen sailboats out where they're just way over
sw3964B-ms98-a-0046 224.252750 226.917625 and that's they're just moving right on out [laughter]
sw3964B-ms98-a-0047 226.917625 227.682125 [laughter]
sw3964B-ms98-a-0048 227.682125 237.248875 and uh that's his favorite way um even to the point where you've got to have someone on the up side you know putting some weight on there [laughter-so] [laughter-you] [laughter-don't] [laughter-go] [laughter-over]
