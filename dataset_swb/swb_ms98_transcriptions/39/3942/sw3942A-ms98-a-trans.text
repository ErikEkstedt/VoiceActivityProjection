sw3942A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.132000 [noise]
sw3942A-ms98-a-0002 0.132000 8.760375 well the topic's about government um [noise] i'm not altogether sure that that's my best topic um [noise]
sw3942A-ms98-a-0003 8.760375 11.031000 [silence]
sw3942A-ms98-a-0004 11.031000 12.845875 yeah
sw3942A-ms98-a-0005 12.845875 13.993750 [silence]
sw3942A-ms98-a-0006 13.993750 15.493250 um-hum
sw3942A-ms98-a-0007 15.493250 17.080500 um-hum
sw3942A-ms98-a-0008 17.080500 19.787500 [silence]
sw3942A-ms98-a-0009 19.787500 21.509500 uh-huh
sw3942A-ms98-a-0010 21.509500 23.863125 um-hum [noise]
sw3942A-ms98-a-0011 23.863125 33.002375 yeah i- i- i think that the last uh part of that question was particularly interesting um [noise] about um
sw3942A-ms98-a-0012 33.002375 39.693875 uh uh can all unethical behavior or how much unethical behavior can be made illegal
sw3942A-ms98-a-0013 39.693875 54.225000 uh because i[t]- i[t]- it seems to me that when [noise] uh government or public service of any kind degenerates so much that [noise] you have to have so many explicit ethical
sw3942A-ms98-a-0014 54.225000 63.137125 codes um parallel to the legal codes [noise] that uh we're focusing on the wrong thing [noise] maybe
sw3942A-ms98-a-0015 63.137125 74.070125 m[aybe]- maybe that's what is happening maybe so many things have become public with the media over the past [noise] you know ten to twenty years that uh [noise]
sw3942A-ms98-a-0016 74.070125 88.936125 it becomes more evident perhaps things that we didn't think of before and just concentrated on the lawmaking or the results that would be seen in public works or bills that are passed or you know etcetera like that [noise] and we
sw3942A-ms98-a-0017 88.936125 101.605625 we're just not exposed to the personal lives of these persons and i couldn't help thinking when that last quest[ion]- it was a funny question [noise] when that last part of the question came about h[ow]- how many
sw3942A-ms98-a-0018 101.605625 109.843625 things can we um actually put a legal code on [noise] that um uh h[ow]- how much um
sw3942A-ms98-a-0019 109.843625 118.942625 should it be our [noise] uh prerogative to see into the private lives of these people you know um
sw3942A-ms98-a-0020 118.942625 122.049500 that's right
sw3942A-ms98-a-0021 122.049500 124.060000 [silence]
sw3942A-ms98-a-0022 124.060000 125.587875 yeah
sw3942A-ms98-a-0023 125.587875 127.461375 [silence]
sw3942A-ms98-a-0024 127.461375 129.515375 um-hum
sw3942A-ms98-a-0025 129.515375 131.400625 um-hum
sw3942A-ms98-a-0026 131.400625 134.960000 [silence]
sw3942A-ms98-a-0027 134.960000 148.488000 i- i- i agree with that and [noise] um and also that if the [noise] results that they are putting out and what they actually seem to be accomplishing by legitimate means is what's
sw3942A-ms98-a-0028 148.488000 152.580125 you know going to the public [noise] then um
sw3942A-ms98-a-0029 152.580125 164.364500 [noise] then they'll pay for their private life in their own private conscience [laughter] and uh uh you kn[ow]- when it becomes public though it becomes scandalous
sw3942A-ms98-a-0030 164.364500 168.244625 the the that's that's the thing that [noise] um i[t]- i[t]- things that
sw3942A-ms98-a-0031 168.244625 181.023000 you don't know uh d[o]- do do not worm their way around then and influence other people or perhaps lead other people astray people could say oh they do it so [noise] i guess you know but as soon as things do get public
sw3942A-ms98-a-0032 181.023000 191.939000 um there there is that terrible concern so sometimes i ask myself what are [noise] um people doing that are in the media
sw3942A-ms98-a-0033 191.939000 203.565125 [noise] when somebody you know comes up to office it seems that one of the first thing that's done is to dig up any kind of a thing they can on them and get it all over the headlines
sw3942A-ms98-a-0034 203.565125 205.143375 [silence]
sw3942A-ms98-a-0035 205.143375 213.835500 it's a very low way of living um so a[nd]- and and and as far as um [noise] 
sw3942A-ms98-a-0036 213.835500 220.245125 you know myself having any particular personal uh knowledge or insight into
sw3942A-ms98-a-0037 220.245125 223.370625 [noise] politics or politicians it i'm not
sw3942A-ms98-a-0038 223.370625 236.893125 terribly involved in it just in a very cursory way i vote and i [noise] you know try to do whatever i can on a little local area but i- i i[t]- it just is not one of the things that i have uh placed um
sw3942A-ms98-a-0039 236.893125 244.360500 an[d]- uh a lot of my particular time and effort into so i- i always feel very
sw3942A-ms98-a-0040 244.360500 252.135875 outside this kind of um [noise] this kind of an issue but um um
sw3942A-ms98-a-0041 252.135875 265.647375 yeah um-hum um-hum yeah right yeah uh um um-hum i'm not i'm not in there i'm not one of those uh you know volunteers that's there at headquarters and
sw3942A-ms98-a-0042 265.647375 277.654750 whatever um although i admire the people that do that and they certainly do get inside information and um of course the better you know a person that might be affiliated with that kind of thing [noise]
sw3942A-ms98-a-0043 277.654750 286.092750 the more you can trust their their judgment and their insight but the media insight as you said i just kind of read and
sw3942A-ms98-a-0044 286.092750 298.562000 [noise] kind of be aware and then uh i don't like to make a whole lot of um judgment m[y]- myself unless things are so absolutely out of whack that uh
