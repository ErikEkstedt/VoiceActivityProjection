sw3906B-ms98-a-0005 24.610125 38.794625 i think you're right there uh it might be a little more ruthless uh to go with the free enterprise system the government has a s[ort]- sort of a habit of investing in things that don't pay much return
sw3906B-ms98-a-0006 38.794625 47.460375 and in[to]- getting into projects that uh there is no yield on the investment so it's all money down the rat hole
sw3906B-ms98-a-0007 47.460375 56.227125 [silence]
sw3906B-ms98-a-0008 56.227125 58.005000 um-hum

sw3906B-ms98-a-0010 66.075375 78.886125 no i'm uh sort of in Fairfax County working for uh one of the uh free loaders on the government uh government contract uh group uh
sw3906B-ms98-a-0011 78.886125 88.955250 so you know somebody once accused uh accused us of uh uh being a welfare program for engineers [laughter]
sw3906B-ms98-a-0012 88.955250 96.308875 [silence]
sw3906B-ms98-a-0013 96.308875 97.912000 um-hum

sw3906B-ms98-a-0017 111.726750 114.431500 um-hum
sw3906B-ms98-a-0018 114.431500 115.937625 [silence]
sw3906B-ms98-a-0019 115.937625 124.211125 well i think my father went through his life saying that he just keeps paying taxes and paying taxes and paying taxes
sw3906B-ms98-a-0020 124.211125 127.462875 and he never [laughter-got] [laughter-anything] [laughter-out] [laughter-of] [laughter-the] [laughter-government] [laughter-for] [laughter-it]
sw3906B-ms98-a-0021 127.462875 129.427625 uh
sw3906B-ms98-a-0022 129.427625 132.311375 [silence]
sw3906B-ms98-a-0023 132.311375 133.594750 yeah
sw3906B-ms98-a-0024 133.594750 142.040125 [silence]
sw3906B-ms98-a-0025 142.040125 145.573375 well the welfare is a good example that uh
sw3906B-ms98-a-0026 145.573375 157.372500 you know if if welfare is handled at the local level by small groups like the churches and some of the organized charities that that get people involved directly
sw3906B-ms98-a-0027 157.372500 164.673500 uh then the money gets right straight to the people and there's a lot of volunteer work and and supporting that type of operation
sw3906B-ms98-a-0028 164.673500 171.736625 but you let the government handle it and next thing you know you're spending four out of five dollars just to administer it
sw3906B-ms98-a-0029 171.736625 174.998250 and it just seems like nothing gets down to the people
sw3906B-ms98-a-0030 174.998250 177.041000 [noise]
sw3906B-ms98-a-0031 177.041000 178.176750 huh
sw3906B-ms98-a-0032 178.176750 194.620375 [silence]
sw3906B-ms98-a-0033 194.620375 197.544000 um-hum
sw3906B-ms98-a-0034 197.544000 200.571250 [silence]
sw3906B-ms98-a-0035 200.571250 201.732000 yeah
sw3906B-ms98-a-0036 201.732000 203.449250 [noise]
sw3906B-ms98-a-0037 203.449250 209.162875 yeah well i'm afraid they may have a more bureaucratic system than we do
sw3906B-ms98-a-0038 209.162875 220.865750 uh i think one of my biggest concern on taxes is uh real estate uh taxes down at the local level the federal government seems to be pretty stable you know you can figure out what they're gonna charge you next year
sw3906B-ms98-a-0039 220.865750 225.870750 but uh since i moved into this house five years ago the real estate tax has doubled
sw3906B-ms98-a-0040 225.870750 236.992000 and i'm just afraid that by the time i'm ready to retire and uh the mortgage is paid off on this house i won't be able to afford the taxes on it
sw3906B-ms98-a-0041 236.992000 248.488500 yeah well that was true on the last house i bought i got a thirty year mortgage on it and by the time i uh sold it the the tax payment was a bigger part of the uh
sw3906B-ms98-a-0042 248.488500 254.711125 of the mortgage payment [noise] yeah
sw3906B-ms98-a-0043 254.711125 263.426125 and i figure it just says that uh when i'm ready to retire i'm gonna have to move out of Fairfax County and get out in the country some place
sw3906B-ms98-a-0044 263.426125 275.027750 uh and there's no control over it uh the accessors just come around and say okay you're assessment just went up twenty thirty percent and uh
sw3906B-ms98-a-0045 275.027750 277.254375 you know there's no recourse
sw3906B-ms98-a-0046 277.254375 282.745250 [silence]
sw3906B-ms98-a-0047 282.745250 287.842250 well the property taxes are supposed to pay for education and some of the county services
sw3906B-ms98-a-0048 287.842250 295.565000 uh and i- i hope that some of that is working efficiently we have a pretty good school system
sw3906B-ms98-a-0049 295.565000 299.330000 i'm a little concerned that there's too much paper work there for them_1
