sw3932B-ms98-a-0033 122.303875 131.185250 i[t]- you know each family has their own own way of doing it i- i do it about the same way you do you know we pay what what needs to be paid
sw3932B-ms98-a-0034 131.185250 138.981500 so that we don't you know we don't have the lights turned off or have the e[lectric]- water turned off or the phone turned off

sw3932B-ms98-a-0043 175.843750 188.160000 problems that we have you know a[re]- are things that we kind of brought on ourselves because we kind of overextended ourselves of couple of you know few years ago with uh
sw3932B-ms98-a-0044 188.160000 195.914875 credit cards and stuff and then the economy went bad and you know i was out of work for a coup[le]- you know for little while
sw3932B-ms98-a-0045 195.914875 204.994000 and uh you know been on commissions f[or]- for you know few years and it's just um
sw3932B-ms98-a-0046 204.994000 209.885250 we just never got caught up so do you own your own home
sw3932B-ms98-a-0047 209.885250 218.564875 yeah well we do too and that makes it even tougher because you know we tried to put our house up for sale a[nd]-
sw3932B-ms98-a-0048 218.564875 222.375625 and uh the economy's so bad we couldn't sell it
sw3932B-ms98-a-0049 222.375625 230.908875 [silence]

sw3932B-ms98-a-0052 235.990250 242.212000 yeah well we got we you know all we asked out of our house was the the note
sw3932B-ms98-a-0053 242.212000 250.865375 and um shoot uh somebody came and and offered us we would've lost twenty thousand dollars on our home
sw3932B-ms98-a-0054 250.865375 253.641125 you know if we were just to sell it
sw3932B-ms98-a-0055 253.641125 257.562125 and uh so we decided to keep it and kind of just
sw3932B-ms98-a-0056 257.562125 259.540375 uh
sw3932B-ms98-a-0057 259.540375 262.535375 yeah try to make things uh work
sw3932B-ms98-a-0058 262.535375 264.365000 [silence]
sw3932B-ms98-a-0059 264.365000 271.839500 she doesn't i mean she d[oes]- actually she does she actually probably works more than i do but she does sewing and hair and stuff at home
sw3932B-ms98-a-0060 271.839500 279.576875 and um so the only you know i guess bright uh
sw3932B-ms98-a-0061 279.576875 291.523625 uh thing that we have to look forward to is that i own part of the company that that uh i work for and and so that's kind of helping us out you know it's making things a little more um
