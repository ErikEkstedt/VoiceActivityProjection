sw3910A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 2.571250 [noise] how do you uh feel about the metric system
sw3910A-ms98-a-0002 2.571250 16.124000 [silence]
sw3910A-ms98-a-0003 16.124000 17.838250 well
sw3910A-ms98-a-0004 17.838250 22.372750 yeah i'll tell you i was i was thinking about it while i was waiting for a connection
sw3910A-ms98-a-0005 22.372750 37.006750 and i in my business i have to do conversions back and forth between [vocalized-noise] metric tons and uh then i converted into barrels and gallons and then i deal with long tons and so forth and so on and i will admit that it does make it uh 
sw3910A-ms98-a-0006 37.006750 50.198500 uh perhaps a little bit cumbersome at the same time i don't know it's one of the oddities one of the few things that are left you know is is as the world shrinks we become more and more homogenized everybody
sw3910A-ms98-a-0007 50.198500 64.982125 yeah it seems to uh uh [noise] you know it it's like it's like accents even you know there's not used to be there's a great variation across the US and now with television everybody is beginning to sound like uh a news uh announcer you kn[ow]-
sw3910A-ms98-a-0008 64.982125 68.070375 and and the whole um i don't know i[t]-
sw3910A-ms98-a-0009 68.070375 79.495125 yeah but i i don't know i kind of got a soft spot in my uh my heart for feet and inches even though i- i like i say in in my business i do have to uh to work around it
sw3910A-ms98-a-0010 79.495125 82.619500 [silence]
sw3910A-ms98-a-0011 82.619500 84.031125 yeah
sw3910A-ms98-a-0012 84.031125 91.918125 [silence]
sw3910A-ms98-a-0013 91.918125 99.090500 you know i think one of one of the reasons that i've got some hesitancy about doing it is that i still have a difficult time
sw3910A-ms98-a-0014 99.090500 111.379125 i mean there are few [noise] of pieces of the metric system that i can visualize okay i- i- i've gotten pretty good at at at you know i realize about that how long a a meter is
sw3910A-ms98-a-0015 111.379125 121.528375 okay but as far as you know and it's uh i've kind of got the conversion of different parts of the metric system where i'm comfortable with it but i'm not with weights
sw3910A-ms98-a-0016 121.528375 132.160000 and and until i- i- i guess it would be something that if i had been uh uh a little more educated in it or forced into using it more i might be more comfortable with it
sw3910A-ms98-a-0017 132.160000 144.813750 [silence]
sw3910A-ms98-a-0018 144.813750 146.251000 uh-huh
sw3910A-ms98-a-0019 146.251000 157.457750 [silence]
sw3910A-ms98-a-0020 157.457750 163.771875 well well sure it'd take a new gener[ation]- it would take a new generation to be just you know completely metric
sw3910A-ms98-a-0021 163.771875 165.595500 [silence]
sw3910A-ms98-a-0022 165.595500 167.519875 yeah i think you're right
sw3910A-ms98-a-0023 167.519875 172.075375 [silence]
sw3910A-ms98-a-0024 172.075375 173.392375 yeah
sw3910A-ms98-a-0025 173.392375 175.823750 [silence]
sw3910A-ms98-a-0026 175.823750 185.273250 well [noise] you know they try to in one of the in one of the parts of the question they ask you know jus[t]- ask t[o]- ask us to discuss was uh uh
sw3910A-ms98-a-0027 185.273250 197.547375 why why the first attempt failed you know and i was think[ing]- i d[on't]- i don't know i- i don't really have a good answer for that other than i guess it was just that much uh uh resistance to change
sw3910A-ms98-a-0028 197.547375 201.177000 [silence]
sw3910A-ms98-a-0029 201.177000 207.752125 that's true and and the other thing too they're they were going to use both systems you know simultaneously
sw3910A-ms98-a-0030 207.752125 211.852000 [silence]
sw3910A-ms98-a-0031 211.852000 213.236375 right
sw3910A-ms98-a-0032 213.236375 221.550250 [silence]
sw3910A-ms98-a-0033 221.550250 229.276750 yeah they didn't -[un]til uh [noise] you know uh strawberries by anything but uh kilograms then you know rather than pounds
sw3910A-ms98-a-0034 229.276750 231.059500 sure
sw3910A-ms98-a-0035 231.059500 233.059375 [silence]
sw3910A-ms98-a-0036 233.059375 245.149000 yeah and then and then you could you know people would start loo[king]- seeing a you know a quantity and they would say well hey that you know that's ab[out]- that looks to be about two pounds and hey that's this much you know in metric so you know
sw3910A-ms98-a-0037 245.149000 246.204250 [silence]
sw3910A-ms98-a-0038 246.204250 247.433750 [noise]

sw3910A-ms98-a-0042 263.067750 276.466875 yeah of course i've i do think there's always that there's still kind of a uh [noise] i don't know a a romance if you will with the idea of a yard being the uh the link from the king's nose to the tip of his uh finger or you know
sw3910A-ms98-a-0043 276.466875 280.169500 [laughter]
sw3910A-ms98-a-0044 280.169500 289.001625 so i you know [vocalized-noise] and and tha[t]- that and i- i think i don't know then all these other old English stories that go back you know that with our uh with our system of measurement
