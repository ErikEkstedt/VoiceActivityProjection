sw3910B-ms98-a-0003 1.695750 9.230750 well uh i i was just talking to my dad about that just a couple of weeks ago and i think i think it'd be great that we went to it
sw3910B-ms98-a-0004 9.230750 19.332750 and uh th[e]- the one thing though that i think we should do if we go to the metric system then we should do away with the other system and and have only the metric system
sw3910B-ms98-a-0005 19.332750 21.914250 [silence]
sw3910B-ms98-a-0006 21.914250 22.944750 uh-huh

sw3910B-ms98-a-0016 48.969750 50.791750 well that's true
sw3910B-ms98-a-0017 50.791750 54.123375 [silence]
sw3910B-ms98-a-0018 54.123375 55.391125 yeah

sw3910B-ms98-a-0022 63.549250 71.319250 yeah that's true you're right you're right there's no losing we're losing our culture of our area uh-huh
sw3910B-ms98-a-0023 71.319250 76.085375 [silence]
sw3910B-ms98-a-0024 76.085375 78.072125 sure yeah
sw3910B-ms98-a-0025 78.072125 92.383375 yeah well i uh i work in a hospital and of course that's all we use and e[very]- and every thing we do is metric you know and uh you know weights is in kilograms and uh you know wh[atever]- whatever is whatever happens to be the thing that we're measuring it's in metric
sw3910B-ms98-a-0026 92.383375 93.693125 and uh
sw3910B-ms98-a-0027 93.693125 104.453000 [silence]
sw3910B-ms98-a-0028 104.453000 106.258500 yeah yeah
sw3910B-ms98-a-0029 106.258500 110.600625 [silence]
sw3910B-ms98-a-0030 110.600625 112.359000 right right
sw3910B-ms98-a-0031 112.359000 119.000500 [silence]
sw3910B-ms98-a-0032 119.000500 120.757500 yeah
sw3910B-ms98-a-0033 120.757500 122.427625 yeah
sw3910B-ms98-a-0034 122.427625 129.150250 [silence]
sw3910B-ms98-a-0035 129.150250 131.918000 yeah yeah sure right
sw3910B-ms98-a-0036 131.918000 145.565125 well uh uh one one of the things that really i- i really think it would be sort of weird is is the uh cars the miles per hour instead of having uh having kilo[meters]- um kilometers per hour
sw3910B-ms98-a-0037 145.565125 158.639750 cause it it's hard to imagine you know i well i think the problem with us our generation is that nobody even if we did go all the way to the metric system that we're still going to think in terms of how it relates to the other system [laughter-you] [laughter-know]
sw3910B-ms98-a-0038 158.639750 161.180500 no matter what y[ou]-
sw3910B-ms98-a-0039 161.180500 166.497750 that's right that's right because it's hard to it's just like uh another language i guess
sw3910B-ms98-a-0040 166.497750 177.121125 and when you learn another language um i guess what you have to do is try to think in that language and not think in in terms of translating it to English you know but
sw3910B-ms98-a-0041 177.121125 186.887125 [silence]
sw3910B-ms98-a-0042 186.887125 189.048125 yeah yeah
sw3910B-ms98-a-0043 189.048125 196.208625 [silence]
sw3910B-ms98-a-0044 196.208625 203.587250 i think so too and i think that uh that it wa[s]- it was pretty much optional wasn't it at the time and and uh
sw3910B-ms98-a-0045 203.587250 205.195375 [silence]
sw3910B-ms98-a-0046 205.195375 217.948625 yeah that's right see that's why i think it is i think they used both systems and everybody as long as they had inches [vocalized-noise] they could just transpose back and forth and it made it difficult so everybody thought well this is too much trouble
sw3910B-ms98-a-0047 217.948625 223.631375 but uh of course if you didn't have anything available but metrics i think it'd be a little easier on you you know
sw3910B-ms98-a-0048 223.631375 225.632500 [silence]
sw3910B-ms98-a-0049 225.632500 235.003500 that's right that's right y[ou]- you'd you would just quit thinking you wouldn't worry about how many ounces is this you would just say well how many how many uh grams is it you know and
sw3910B-ms98-a-0050 235.003500 237.761500 [silence]
sw3910B-ms98-a-0051 237.761500 239.073125 yeah
sw3910B-ms98-a-0052 239.073125 243.365375 [silence]
sw3910B-ms98-a-0053 243.365375 257.365500 sure yeah yeah and it's uh like weight you know i- i weigh about a hundred and sixty five and that's i know somewhere in the neighborhood of seventy something kilograms you know and i[t's]- it's hard to imagine well only seventy something you feel like you don't weigh much you know
sw3910B-ms98-a-0054 257.365500 264.614000 but um i guess if that's the only thing you knew well you would just know well i weigh seventy something kilograms and that's it you know [laughter]
sw3910B-ms98-a-0055 264.614000 269.081375 [silence]
sw3910B-ms98-a-0056 269.081375 271.081500 well that's true
sw3910B-ms98-a-0057 271.081500 274.656875 [silence]
sw3910B-ms98-a-0058 274.656875 281.806875 [laughter] yeah i understand that it's that's true that's very true that's very true
sw3910B-ms98-a-0059 281.806875 285.216375 [silence]
sw3910B-ms98-a-0060 285.216375 287.589375 yeah that's right
sw3910B-ms98-a-0061 287.589375 288.644375 [laughter]
sw3910B-ms98-a-0062 288.644375 300.546000 it's funny that uh i guess all that started in England i guess all the m[easurement]- system of measurement and now uh we're still using it and they are gone they've left it you [laughter-know] and they use metrics there
