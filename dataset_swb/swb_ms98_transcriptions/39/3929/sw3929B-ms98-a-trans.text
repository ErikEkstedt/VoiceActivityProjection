sw3929B-ms98-a-0016 113.447625 118.678250 oh Ge[rshwin]- uh Gershwin's uh i i i uh
sw3929B-ms98-a-0017 118.678250 131.212375 i i haven't uh quite found jazz to be enjoyable and and and a lot of Gershwin has a a some of some of his work is a little uh ha[s]- ha[s]- has a tou[ch]- e[nough]- enough of jazz uh
sw3929B-ms98-a-0018 131.212375 138.212500 that uh that uh is not particularly enjoyable for me to listen to the uh
sw3929B-ms98-a-0019 138.212500 140.234125 uh
sw3929B-ms98-a-0020 140.234125 152.395625 uh like i i i suspect my favorites uh are in the uh seventeenth and eighteenth century uh uh musicians uh i'd
sw3929B-ms98-a-0021 152.395625 164.458375 the uh oh there's one uh uh i guess more recent one with uh Copeland uh is uh Raspegie who uh i was always amazed that he was uh so con[temporary]- uh contemporary
sw3929B-ms98-a-0022 164.458375 167.817625 um but i uh
sw3929B-ms98-a-0023 167.817625 180.354625 uh i our family gets down to uh the Myerson relatively frequently it it's our uh uh our one enjoyable uh if if we can make it to Saturday uh everything's okay
sw3929B-ms98-a-0024 180.354625 193.037125 so it's uh it's a relatively busy uh activity we uh one uh very nice uh uh opportunity that we've had is the is the Dallas Chamber Orchestra
sw3929B-ms98-a-0025 193.037125 205.321625 that has uh uh uh actually it's it's it's wonderful they they have a Sunday matinee that uh uh if you buy two season tickets the kids go free

sw3929B-ms98-a-0031 233.475375 245.601750 in that uh th[eir]- th[eir]- y[ou]- their they you can get real close to the uh to the chamber orchestra and see the music and watch the musicians it's uh it's a very intimate setting and the the music's really very good
