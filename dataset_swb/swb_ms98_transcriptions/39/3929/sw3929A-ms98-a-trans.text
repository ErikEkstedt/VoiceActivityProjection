sw3929A-ms98-a-0006 25.642750 35.484250 a musician i just took it kind of as an avocation and i sing with the Brookhaven singers over at Brookhaven College you must be familiar with that name living in Dallas
sw3929A-ms98-a-0007 35.484250 42.762875 and uh they have um a lovely woman over there who um teaches singing and um

sw3929A-ms98-a-0010 64.371625 77.391500 but anyway i do enjoy listening to especially the classical music that has some kind of a story line or a theme like Beethoven's Pastoral and things like that where you can
sw3929A-ms98-a-0011 77.391500 89.576625 follow um through some of the mood of the of the melodies and not just have um you know a kind of mathematical arrangement of the notes which is
