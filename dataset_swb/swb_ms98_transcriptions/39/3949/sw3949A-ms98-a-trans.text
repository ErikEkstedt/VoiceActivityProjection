sw3949A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.384000 [noise]
sw3949A-ms98-a-0002 0.384000 5.298875 okay uh Utah has a a good school system where uh
sw3949A-ms98-a-0003 5.298875 8.753750 as far as i'm concerned i can't really
sw3949A-ms98-a-0004 8.753750 13.402125 see the difficulty uh or any problems that we have other than
sw3949A-ms98-a-0005 13.402125 17.141375 they keep saying the ACT scores were a little low
sw3949A-ms98-a-0006 17.141375 21.655875 or lower than well we're a[bove]- above the national average but
sw3949A-ms98-a-0007 21.655875 28.465500 they're talking in the newspapers all the time that we're not doing as well as other countries in science and math
sw3949A-ms98-a-0008 28.465500 32.508500 which i think there's been an effort to to increase that so
sw3949A-ms98-a-0009 32.508500 37.104250 i don't see that there's se[rious]- any serious uh problems with our
sw3949A-ms98-a-0010 37.104250 39.871875 school systems here in Utah
sw3949A-ms98-a-0011 39.871875 42.247750 uh what about Texas
sw3949A-ms98-a-0012 42.247750 47.583250 [silence]
sw3949A-ms98-a-0013 47.583250 48.620000 uh-huh
sw3949A-ms98-a-0014 48.620000 56.667250 [silence]
sw3949A-ms98-a-0015 56.667250 58.051125 yeah
sw3949A-ms98-a-0016 58.051125 59.141000 [silence] 
sw3949A-ms98-a-0017 59.141000 60.973875 we[ll]- i ha[te]- i hate to hear it 
sw3949A-ms98-a-0018 60.973875 63.782250 [silence]
sw3949A-ms98-a-0019 63.782250 64.565625 huh
sw3949A-ms98-a-0020 64.565625 69.431750 where the students are kind of controlling the the schools then in some areas
sw3949A-ms98-a-0021 69.431750 78.119625 [silence]
sw3949A-ms98-a-0022 78.119625 79.213750 oh boy
sw3949A-ms98-a-0023 79.213750 80.776000 [silence]
sw3949A-ms98-a-0024 80.776000 85.584125 yeah that's not good uh i'd hate to teach under those situations
sw3949A-ms98-a-0025 85.584125 91.730750 [laughter] well well that hasn't got here yet i hope it it doesn't but uh
sw3949A-ms98-a-0026 91.730750 96.222750 it i know we're we're starting to have a few gangs here
sw3949A-ms98-a-0027 96.222750 98.594875 associated with the schools
sw3949A-ms98-a-0028 98.594875 99.990250 [silence]
sw3949A-ms98-a-0029 99.990250 100.820000 yeah
sw3949A-ms98-a-0030 100.820000 102.923625 but that's where it begins i guess
sw3949A-ms98-a-0031 102.923625 106.422125 [silence]
sw3949A-ms98-a-0032 106.422125 107.919875 uh-huh
sw3949A-ms98-a-0033 107.919875 110.340375 but at least uh
sw3949A-ms98-a-0034 110.340375 114.141750 i i go into the schools quite a bit in my occupation
sw3949A-ms98-a-0035 114.141750 116.304250 the different high schools in the
sw3949A-ms98-a-0036 116.304250 119.025500 in the six western states that i
sw3949A-ms98-a-0037 119.025500 120.784625 i work in
sw3949A-ms98-a-0038 120.784625 122.135375 and uh
sw3949A-ms98-a-0039 122.135375 125.973625 generally from what i can see the uh
sw3949A-ms98-a-0040 125.973625 130.468375 we don't really have that type of problems in any of the states yet
sw3949A-ms98-a-0041 130.468375 134.423750 but i know talking to my uh counterparts back east that they're
sw3949A-ms98-a-0042 134.423750 135.610375 [silence]
sw3949A-ms98-a-0043 135.610375 139.930500 they have uh security guards that patrol the hallways and
sw3949A-ms98-a-0044 139.930500 144.655750 and that's not a good learning situation if you've got to have policemen there to
sw3949A-ms98-a-0045 144.655750 146.605250 keep kids in class and
sw3949A-ms98-a-0046 146.605250 148.747875 [silence]
sw3949A-ms98-a-0047 148.747875 155.052000 so it sound like that's it's kind of getting to that point in Texas in at least where you're at
sw3949A-ms98-a-0048 155.052000 165.687750 [silence]
sw3949A-ms98-a-0049 165.687750 166.827875 yes [vocalized-noise]
sw3949A-ms98-a-0050 166.827875 171.920000 [silence]
sw3949A-ms98-a-0051 171.920000 173.289125 um-hum
sw3949A-ms98-a-0052 173.289125 176.159875 that's true and i i think that uh
sw3949A-ms98-a-0053 176.159875 179.375875 i[n]- in our Utah school systems we
sw3949A-ms98-a-0054 179.375875 185.538375 we've kind of reversed going from the social classes back to
sw3949A-ms98-a-0055 185.538375 189.800375 a lot of the academic classes that uh they feel is necessary
sw3949A-ms98-a-0056 189.800375 192.516375 and i think that is that's a good change to
sw3949A-ms98-a-0057 192.516375 195.116625 to get back instead of so many uh
sw3949A-ms98-a-0058 195.116625 199.520000 off the wall classes that have nothing to do with academic e[ducation]-
sw3949A-ms98-a-0059 199.520000 200.862625 you know education
sw3949A-ms98-a-0060 200.862625 203.683000 [silence]
sw3949A-ms98-a-0061 203.683000 205.180375 [vocalized-noise] uh
sw3949A-ms98-a-0062 205.180375 208.327625 yes there does uh you can't uh
sw3949A-ms98-a-0063 208.327625 211.013000 go from one extreme to the other and
sw3949A-ms98-a-0064 211.013000 218.502500 th[ere]- there has to be a balance there's got to be both there but i think it should be a little stronger on the academic uh portion
sw3949A-ms98-a-0065 218.502500 223.779250 in order to prepare them_1 for the society today with the technology that we have they've
sw3949A-ms98-a-0066 223.779250 228.708750 they've got to have a good math an english background in order to compete
sw3949A-ms98-a-0067 228.708750 237.414125 [silence]
sw3949A-ms98-a-0068 237.414125 246.560000 no they're talking about uh in some of the states back here are going two hundred days a year instead of a hundred and eighty i don't know what your school year is there but
sw3949A-ms98-a-0069 246.560000 253.421875 [silence]
sw3949A-ms98-a-0070 253.421875 254.336750 um-hum
sw3949A-ms98-a-0071 254.336750 257.887000 [silence]
sw3949A-ms98-a-0072 257.887000 258.898250 [noise]
sw3949A-ms98-a-0073 258.898250 264.709750 we have a a there's a little of that going on here but it's all in the elementary grades it's not in the upper uh
sw3949A-ms98-a-0074 264.709750 267.259375 in the secondary area
sw3949A-ms98-a-0075 267.259375 276.485250 but i it's there's some test cases to see uh if the students are able to if they don't lose as much uh
sw3949A-ms98-a-0076 276.485250 282.979625 they're able to retain more where they're only out for a month instead of three months and they have to go
sw3949A-ms98-a-0077 282.979625 285.059250 [silence]
sw3949A-ms98-a-0078 285.059250 286.313375 uh-huh
sw3949A-ms98-a-0079 286.313375 288.902125 so it sounds like uh [noise]
sw3949A-ms98-a-0080 288.902125 294.834875 in your area and this area too that they're trying to work on the problem that they see as a problem
sw3949A-ms98-a-0081 294.834875 298.178000 to correct the s[ome]- s[ome]- some of the situations uh
