sw3992A-ms98-a-0008 37.087875 47.948375 yeah our taxes it's nice to see them_1 spent for things that benefit the community but when we see them wasted that's when we think we're paying too much

sw3992A-ms98-a-0018 93.321875 103.627750 i know um i felt very fortunate once when i talked with a lady from England and she said their taxes are at least fifty percent
sw3992A-ms98-a-0019 103.627750 111.542375 and uh in talking to people i've met from other places uh we do seem to get off light
