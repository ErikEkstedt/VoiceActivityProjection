sw3962A-ms98-a-0006 17.223875 25.163750 oh well i guess i like a wide range uh everything from uh from Baroque through at least some modern music
sw3962A-ms98-a-0007 25.163750 30.973625 and my wife and i these days are especially into opera we've been sort of opera fans for a few years now
sw3962A-ms98-a-0008 30.973625 36.600500 [silence]
sw3962A-ms98-a-0009 36.600500 42.020750 well we uh generally the places we've gone they sing in the original languages
sw3962A-ms98-a-0010 42.020750 45.161875 like the Dallas Opera here normally does i guess
sw3962A-ms98-a-0011 45.161875 56.257125 [silence]
sw3962A-ms98-a-0012 56.257125 64.517125 well one thing that's helped us a lot is that uh you you know you can buy a lot of these operas now on video casse[ttes]- uh video tape
sw3962A-ms98-a-0013 64.517125 74.887000 and so we have quite a collection of those and you watch them_1 at home and they have subtitles so you you figure out what's going on after a while and then you can enjoy it in the uh theater
sw3962A-ms98-a-0014 74.887000 81.225125 but you know the uh Dallas opera now has uh super titles on on all their performances i think
sw3962A-ms98-a-0015 81.225125 86.647625 well they they give an uh an English translation on a on a screen up above the stage
sw3962A-ms98-a-0016 86.647625 88.126125 yeah
sw3962A-ms98-a-0017 88.126125 89.903875 [silence] 
sw3962A-ms98-a-0018 89.903875 95.437125 [noise] in fact they even do that for operas sung sung in English because_1 it is hard to understand the words some times
sw3962A-ms98-a-0019 95.437125 103.357500 [silence]
sw3962A-ms98-a-0020 103.357500 112.994625 yeah well i really like Vivaldi uh he's uh definitely uh one of the one of the top of that era
