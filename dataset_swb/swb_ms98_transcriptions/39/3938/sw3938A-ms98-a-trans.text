sw3938A-ms98-a-0009 47.479750 78.347250 [silence]

sw3938A-ms98-a-0012 90.816875 95.997250 [silence]
sw3938A-ms98-a-0013 95.997250 97.169250 yeah
sw3938A-ms98-a-0014 97.169250 98.519250 [silence]
sw3938A-ms98-a-0015 98.519250 99.647625 yeah
sw3938A-ms98-a-0016 99.647625 102.470625 [silence]
sw3938A-ms98-a-0017 102.470625 103.674750 uh-huh
sw3938A-ms98-a-0018 103.674750 113.540500 [silence]
sw3938A-ms98-a-0019 113.540500 114.941125 uh-huh
sw3938A-ms98-a-0020 114.941125 116.036500 [silence]
sw3938A-ms98-a-0021 116.036500 120.027000 i understand that uh i i do i understand that 
sw3938A-ms98-a-0022 120.027000 125.487875 [silence]
sw3938A-ms98-a-0023 125.487875 127.579625 in[surance]- insurance yeah and
sw3938A-ms98-a-0024 127.579625 141.808125 right right well i've i really have uh you know like i say i i feel like i have made a commitment now to drive the car that i've got which you know a[nd]- and and after i will admit after i had those repairs made on it i felt like you know it felt like it was new again
sw3938A-ms98-a-0025 141.808125 149.502625 yeah and i was very pleased with the money i had put into it which is odd that i ever walk away from spending any money on a car that i felt good about but in
sw3938A-ms98-a-0026 149.502625 160.579750 but in this particular instance i did because_1 everything felt like they just tightened everything up somehow but uh [noise] but i had decided kind of you know just without really giving it a whole lot of thought
sw3938A-ms98-a-0027 160.579750 174.090000 that when i do buy again uh i bought this car that i've got new but probably what i'm going to do sometime in the future is uh i'm going to look around for a good clean used car a year or two old
sw3938A-ms98-a-0028 174.090000 181.504500 [silence]
sw3938A-ms98-a-0029 181.504500 183.580000 yeah yeah
sw3938A-ms98-a-0030 183.580000 193.034375 [silence]
sw3938A-ms98-a-0031 193.034375 205.090250 well and l[et]- you know o[n]- on that note i think anyone you talk with is going to have a different viewpoint on automobiles and re[ally]- and the other thing is too i i don't think that i[t]- wh[at]- what 
sw3938A-ms98-a-0032 205.090250 216.170375 is true for one person may not necessarily be true for another because other you know so many different people have different needs and and and desires as uh as far as cars are concerned but uh
sw3938A-ms98-a-0033 216.170375 224.872875 it's just the the ki[nd]- the i know if i go out to buy a new one i mean i know what kind of money it would take to do it and i just don't want to pay that much money
sw3938A-ms98-a-0034 224.872875 248.255500 [silence]
sw3938A-ms98-a-0035 248.255500 250.667125 yeah i leased one car
sw3938A-ms98-a-0036 250.667125 259.973750 yeah i did that one time i had a i got an eighty five or rather it was a uh well it actually started to lease an eighty four and it was a three year lease
sw3938A-ms98-a-0037 259.973750 260.988000 [silence]
sw3938A-ms98-a-0038 260.988000 269.039125 you know the only thing about it is i mean it was simple to get into and it really wasn't bad to get out of
sw3938A-ms98-a-0039 269.039125 276.847000 but you pay that money every month and then you're finished with it and you don't have nothing to show for it granted if you had
sw3938A-ms98-a-0040 276.847000 283.066750 spent that money buying one you still wouldn't have much to show for it [laughter] but you would have at least a little
sw3938A-ms98-a-0041 283.066750 291.993000 so it's it you know i i think it depends i i i guess there's certain instances that that could be the best thing to do but i don't think i'll go that route again
sw3938A-ms98-a-0042 291.993000 298.786000 [silence]
