sw3959A-ms98-a-0007 25.823125 35.548625 and uh he has uh made three applications to schools that give a double degree program because that's what he wanted to uh take
sw3959A-ms98-a-0008 35.548625 42.447625 so he applied to the University of Texas at Austin and to the University of Pennsylvania and to Rice

sw3959A-ms98-a-0010 52.152875 59.031375 so um i- i think that uh it became very evident in the beginning of senior year
sw3959A-ms98-a-0011 59.031375 65.873750 when he actually had to sit down with the applications he had about six schools that he was interested in
sw3959A-ms98-a-0012 65.873750 72.035750 but he really decided that he wants to take engineering but he also wants to keep a liberal arts
sw3959A-ms98-a-0013 72.035750 78.749000 degree and actually get both of them [noise] and not all that many places actually give you two degrees [noise]
sw3959A-ms98-a-0014 78.749000 88.665500 so he he weeded out the ones uh that did not offer that kind of thing and just really wound up making three applications [laughter] so um

sw3959A-ms98-a-0022 126.738875 133.575375 and uh use the engineering background maybe in patent law or [noise] yeah
sw3959A-ms98-a-0023 133.575375 136.667000 yeah yeah
