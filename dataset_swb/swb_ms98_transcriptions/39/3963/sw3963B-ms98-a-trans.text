sw3963B-ms98-a-0014 31.926625 35.648375 now okay wait wait a there was a topic talking about_1 returning lawn equipment
sw3963B-ms98-a-0015 35.648375 37.298000 or was it anything
sw3963B-ms98-a-0016 37.298000 38.311375 [silence]
sw3963B-ms98-a-0017 38.311375 40.832500 oh okay [laughter]
sw3963B-ms98-a-0018 40.832500 48.209125 now okay um well i uh i returned a camera recently i i bought a little uh Minolta camera
sw3963B-ms98-a-0019 48.209125 54.055250 and uh the auto focus was inconsistent sometimes it would focus and sometimes it wouldn't
sw3963B-ms98-a-0020 54.055250 62.252625 so uh after my second roll of film i i took two rolls before i got decided uh because_1 i changed the first roll out before i had the first one developed
sw3963B-ms98-a-0021 62.252625 72.691375 and after i got the first roll back i knew the camera wasn't it so i uh i took it back and returned it but most i don't know i haven't had to return a lot of stuff
sw3963B-ms98-a-0022 72.691375 75.591000 [silence]
sw3963B-ms98-a-0023 75.591000 82.602250 well i took it back and i figured it was i don't know something like an auto focus i don't know i figured something inherent in the camera design or something
sw3963B-ms98-a-0024 82.602250 85.977625 so i [vocalized-noise] because my dad has a has an auto focus camera 
sw3963B-ms98-a-0025 85.977625 95.795625 and it works great and he's never had any problems in fact he's he's had a couple of them_1 and this is a like a little small one you know and the new smaller cameras are like all mass produced and stuff
sw3963B-ms98-a-0026 95.795625 106.541750 so they're not uh i think they're mo[re]- uh i would think there there's better quality control on those things you know just because_1 they're small and stamped and there's not very sophisticated
sw3963B-ms98-a-0027 106.541750 112.849000 so i guess not call it quality control but you know since they're so generic they wouldn't uh there's you know
sw3963B-ms98-a-0028 112.849000 120.539375 i i my dad has a big sophisticated camera and it always takes good [laughter-pictures] so i just said well hell with it i'll just go out and get a nice camera
sw3963B-ms98-a-0029 120.539375 123.820000 but uh so i took it back and uh i bought a
sw3963B-ms98-a-0030 123.820000 136.145875 i bought a more expensive camera but you know i think when uh when i was in college i was always buying like just cheap stuff stuff that would make do and that's the kind of stuff i took back because_1 you bring it home and you're like oh well this sucks [laughter-you] [laughter-know]
sw3963B-ms98-a-0031 136.145875 139.367000 [silence]
sw3963B-ms98-a-0032 139.367000 141.239375 oh um-hum um-hum
sw3963B-ms98-a-0033 141.239375 144.570000 [silence]
sw3963B-ms98-a-0034 144.570000 145.800000 yeah
sw3963B-ms98-a-0035 145.800000 148.525875 [silence]
sw3963B-ms98-a-0036 148.525875 149.740000 um-hum
sw3963B-ms98-a-0037 149.740000 159.279000 yeah and i think uh the way i was raised my parents always uh used to buy stuff that had a good quality name on it and you know they knew the quality of it before they bought it
sw3963B-ms98-a-0038 159.279000 169.397000 so i don't know and i kind of do the same thing i guess so i haven't had to return a lot if i had had to return it it's more because_1 i realize i didn't need it or you know not because_1 it's defective
sw3963B-ms98-a-0039 169.397000 174.379000 but uh more because_1 uh you know i have the option to take it back and i really didn't need it you know
sw3963B-ms98-a-0040 174.379000 177.732375 rather than you know something being broken
sw3963B-ms98-a-0041 177.732375 181.469750 but that's that's the only thing i've returned recently
sw3963B-ms98-a-0042 181.469750 188.964250 [silence]
sw3963B-ms98-a-0043 188.964250 190.178375 um-hum

sw3963B-ms98-a-0046 192.827125 193.840625 [silence]
sw3963B-ms98-a-0047 193.840625 196.989500 did they send you a new one or did they actually give you a new one at the store
sw3963B-ms98-a-0048 196.989500 200.334000 [silence]
sw3963B-ms98-a-0049 200.334000 201.483375 um-hum
sw3963B-ms98-a-0050 201.483375 206.421375 [silence]

sw3963B-ms98-a-0052 207.586875 208.601875 [silence]
sw3963B-ms98-a-0053 208.601875 217.900250 yeah because_1 i bought some furniture where the top was scratched and uh i just wrote a letter to the manufacturer well they they had a warranty sheet saying if you have any damage send this in
sw3963B-ms98-a-0054 217.900250 225.491750 so i sent it in and uh you know i didn't really think much the table like i said the table was just scratched on the top and uh
sw3963B-ms98-a-0055 225.491750 228.389125 i didn't really it didn't really bother me because_1 it was kind of small
sw3963B-ms98-a-0056 228.389125 230.548625 but i went ahead and sent something in and uh
sw3963B-ms98-a-0057 230.548625 233.154125 three or four weeks later they sent me a brand new table [laughter-top]
sw3963B-ms98-a-0058 233.154125 234.933500 and it came by truck
sw3963B-ms98-a-0059 234.933500 239.623375 and uh i like it was probably more expensive to ship this thing than it cost me for the table top itself
sw3963B-ms98-a-0060 239.623375 250.999500 because_1 uh it was eighty five dollars for shipping and the who[le]- it was a like a computer table you know made with just like uh uh what do they call pressed board or whatever just pre[ssed]- particle board
sw3963B-ms98-a-0061 250.999500 255.971875 right and uh the [tole/whole] table was only like a hundred and ten bucks
sw3963B-ms98-a-0062 255.971875 259.385875 and they spent eighty [laughter-five] [laughter-dollars] shipping this top back to [laughter-me]
sw3963B-ms98-a-0063 259.385875 267.314750 so i was kind of surprised i figured you know i sent that in maybe they would send me something back saying you know uh do you want to exchange it or bring it in or send it back or something like that
sw3963B-ms98-a-0064 267.314750 272.626750 but uh i couldn't believe they sent actually sent a brand new one and they no calls no letters nothing they just sent it to me
sw3963B-ms98-a-0065 272.626750 274.170500 yeah yeah
sw3963B-ms98-a-0066 274.170500 276.123750 [laughter] definitely
sw3963B-ms98-a-0067 276.123750 277.664250 [silence]
sw3963B-ms98-a-0068 277.664250 279.747500 yeah yeah uh
sw3963B-ms98-a-0069 279.747500 282.733000 um-hum um-hum yeah but
sw3963B-ms98-a-0070 282.733000 284.922875 oh well but
sw3963B-ms98-a-0071 284.922875 288.703625 i'd say that's a kind of a short topic this time [laughter]
sw3963B-ms98-a-0072 288.703625 295.988500 [silence]
