sw3901A-ms98-a-0012 43.499875 45.060000 i'm not sure what to do
sw3901A-ms98-a-0013 45.060000 52.344375 well our house is about um twelve years old i guess we've been in it for about two years and 
sw3901A-ms98-a-0014 52.344375 59.293000 i guess there's a[dvantages]- advantages and disadvantages to moving into a new or old house um
sw3901A-ms98-a-0015 59.293000 67.339000 one thing it had all of the window treatments you know so we didn't have to redo that and it had been updated but
sw3901A-ms98-a-0016 67.339000 76.464375 their roof is old was old so uh last year we covered the wood shingles with uh that composition
sw3901A-ms98-a-0017 76.464375 80.574750 and that wa[s]- cost a fortune [laughter] and uh
sw3901A-ms98-a-0018 80.574750 87.611000 now we're we're in the process of uh repainting the interior because we didn't paint when we first moved in
sw3901A-ms98-a-0019 87.611000 97.904750 and uh you know when you shop for houses you don't notice all the little things you think oh this is beautiful [laughter-and] [laughter-everything] [laughter-and] [laughter-then] [laughter-you] [laughter-find] [laughter] out that it's
sw3901A-ms98-a-0020 97.904750 102.507875 you know that it's not as great well there's just a lot of uh i mean it ha[s]-
sw3901A-ms98-a-0021 102.507875 113.617750 that well the family before us raised three kids and a dog and cats and and so there's just wear wear and tear on the house but you don't notice
sw3901A-ms98-a-0022 113.617750 120.113375 until you live in it and have to clean it [laughter] and you know you you find scratch marks on the wood or
sw3901A-ms98-a-0023 120.113375 124.957000 you know places were the dog chewed or i don't know things like that
sw3901A-ms98-a-0024 124.957000 137.679000 [silence]
sw3901A-ms98-a-0025 137.679000 142.161125 i would say uh you know that uh
sw3901A-ms98-a-0026 142.161125 150.773125 who is it the inspector you know that you use just um they have a list of things they go over but
sw3901A-ms98-a-0027 150.773125 157.068750 you know i think we had maybe a list on top of that that some friends ha[d]- of ours had told us to go through
sw3901A-ms98-a-0028 157.068750 167.528750 and just things that they might not normally look for and and go around with them and even if you're kind of on their you know looking over their shoulder or whatever um
sw3901A-ms98-a-0029 167.528750 175.422500 because there's lots of things that furniture hides and you know we have a place we have picture frame paneling in our living room and
sw3901A-ms98-a-0030 175.422500 187.141250 it is in beautiful condition it's uh it's a custom home but there's just areas that they skimped on and uh but the
sw3901A-ms98-a-0031 187.141250 195.673875 the uh picture frame paneling for the most part is beautiful and and they had this big arrangement on the mantel
sw3901A-ms98-a-0032 195.673875 199.704000 and it and i think one thing about the house that made us fall in love with it was
sw3901A-ms98-a-0033 199.704000 207.681000 their decorating you know their furniture [noise] once you move in your furniture [laughter-into] [laughter-the] [laughter-house] [laughter-it's] [laughter-kind] [laughter-of] it doesn't have quite the same look but um
sw3901A-ms98-a-0034 207.681000 213.009750 because_1 we're um you know we haven't been married we've been married for almost four years and
sw3901A-ms98-a-0035 213.009750 215.057875 uh [noise] anyway
sw3901A-ms98-a-0036 215.057875 219.597250 but there's a piece of paneling behind that's above the mantel that has
sw3901A-ms98-a-0037 219.597250 231.999250 um it's right above the fireplace and i think they there must have been some water running down the chimney behind there because_1 there is some water damage and it's warped and with it being picture frame i don't know how to
sw3901A-ms98-a-0038 231.999250 245.479000 how to replace that one piece without having to tear it all down because it's one of the inset pieces so there's a lot of things to you know to look for and um
sw3901A-ms98-a-0039 245.479000 250.924875 but i guess new homes are like that to they probably have things that are constantly
sw3901A-ms98-a-0040 250.924875 262.779625 [noise] needing fixed or at least you probably have to i don't know did did y[ou]- all did the builder provide the mini blinds and stuff like that or did y[ou]- all yeah you had to go purchase all that
sw3901A-ms98-a-0041 262.779625 267.497750 [silence]
sw3901A-ms98-a-0042 267.497750 270.495875 what si[ze]- what size home are you in now
sw3901A-ms98-a-0043 270.495875 272.479000 [silence]
sw3901A-ms98-a-0044 272.479000 274.144375 uh-huh
sw3901A-ms98-a-0045 274.144375 294.030750 [silence]
sw3901A-ms98-a-0046 294.030750 298.752875 [noise] i'm not really familiar with the homes in Garland i guess i know
