sw3902A-ms98-a-0015 52.438375 55.660000 [silence]
sw3902A-ms98-a-0016 55.660000 56.899375 yeah
sw3902A-ms98-a-0017 56.899375 67.576250 [silence]
sw3902A-ms98-a-0018 67.576250 68.980625 right
sw3902A-ms98-a-0019 68.980625 78.186000 my mother-in-law finally they had to make a family decision there's seven children in my husband's family and fortunately four of them_1 live in the same home town
sw3902A-ms98-a-0020 78.186000 82.017500 and she has Alzheimer's it was getting where she was
sw3902A-ms98-a-0021 82.017500 90.561875 getting th[ings]- dangerous i mean letting strangers in and things like this but they were very fortunate it's a small town and
sw3902A-ms98-a-0022 90.561875 103.420375 she happens to room with one of the doctor's mother's and then she's got a lot of family there and that go and see her all of the time but she really doesn't nobody thought she would adjust but she's adjusted beautifully
sw3902A-ms98-a-0023 103.420375 114.224250 but then i am also facing my father who is very sick and my mother and father reside in Colorado she's been taking care of him i don't know how much longer this can last
sw3902A-ms98-a-0024 114.224250 122.074250 and at that point because_1 he requires round the clock he can't do anything without her he doesn't know when to take his medicine
sw3902A-ms98-a-0025 122.074250 127.955125 and it's really sad and i have thought if something would happen to my mother for
sw3902A-ms98-a-0026 127.955125 138.198250 uh my brother's are not interested in helping me so i would have to move him down here that way i want to see the nursing home if i have to put him into one
sw3902A-ms98-a-0027 138.198250 143.529500 you know where i can go see it i i'd be very uncomfortable with him being in Colorado
sw3902A-ms98-a-0028 143.529500 145.767875 and
sw3902A-ms98-a-0029 145.767875 148.412375 [silence]
sw3902A-ms98-a-0030 148.412375 157.432250 yes and some of them_1 are limited care too where people can do uh like they have apartment styles but that wouldn't work for him i think he's beyond that
sw3902A-ms98-a-0031 157.432250 166.765375 where if you need help you can get it but basically people kind of have a small apartment and doctor's are available if they need them and allows
sw3902A-ms98-a-0032 166.765375 168.491750 yeah
sw3902A-ms98-a-0033 168.491750 174.153125 yeah well the only problem with these are that they are very expensive of course i guess all nursing homes there is
sw3902A-ms98-a-0034 174.153125 175.404250 but
sw3902A-ms98-a-0035 175.404250 180.580000 [silence]
sw3902A-ms98-a-0036 180.580000 182.057500 right

sw3902A-ms98-a-0038 184.697625 185.964500 yeah
sw3902A-ms98-a-0039 185.964500 188.090875 [silence]
sw3902A-ms98-a-0040 188.090875 189.729625 right
sw3902A-ms98-a-0041 189.729625 200.256375 yeah i s[ee]- uh yeah and i think a lot of people who do it now in Colorado it's interesting i talked to my mother they allow you sixty five thousand dollars and your car and your home
sw3902A-ms98-a-0042 200.256375 208.364000 and my mother could make it on that what she probably would do is disburse the money to me and then i would send it back to her so that's [laughter-probably] what would happen
sw3902A-ms98-a-0043 208.364000 210.877000 [silence]
sw3902A-ms98-a-0044 210.877000 213.386625 yeah it's unfortunate
sw3902A-ms98-a-0045 213.386625 217.992375 [silence]
sw3902A-ms98-a-0046 217.992375 219.313250 right
sw3902A-ms98-a-0047 219.313250 222.474125 [silence]
sw3902A-ms98-a-0048 222.474125 231.105500 yeah it's frightening and i guess uh i don't know how old you are i'm forty six you know we're the generation moving into this and i don't know how our kids are gonna take care of us
sw3902A-ms98-a-0049 231.105500 232.902125 you know
sw3902A-ms98-a-0050 232.902125 234.299750 yeah
sw3902A-ms98-a-0051 234.299750 238.633625 [silence]
sw3902A-ms98-a-0052 238.633625 239.833750 yeah
sw3902A-ms98-a-0053 239.833750 245.680000 [silence]
sw3902A-ms98-a-0054 245.680000 247.821500 right -[y]eah
sw3902A-ms98-a-0055 247.821500 252.170000 i also fill in my generation a squeeze between
sw3902A-ms98-a-0056 252.170000 263.430000 looking to having to help my parents and still having to help my son because things are so rough out there job wise and he's still living at home and i don't know how he's ever going to [laughter-get] on his own the way things are
sw3902A-ms98-a-0057 263.430000 275.512875 and so it's kind of sq[ueezed]- you feel squeezed in the middle of having both generations but it something will have to change as more and more of us get older uh luckily if we could be like your grandmother
sw3902A-ms98-a-0058 275.512875 279.489375 i uh you know i would love to live to a hundred and two if i were okay
sw3902A-ms98-a-0059 279.489375 284.977375 but you see these people in their seventies yeah most aren't that's the problem
sw3902A-ms98-a-0060 284.977375 294.537000 [silence]
sw3902A-ms98-a-0061 294.537000 296.420000 that's incredible
sw3902A-ms98-a-0062 296.420000 298.850000 [silence]
