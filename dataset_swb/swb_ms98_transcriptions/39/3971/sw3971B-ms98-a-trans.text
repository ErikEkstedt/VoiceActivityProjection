sw3971B-ms98-a-0002 0.163500 1.193625 all right
sw3971B-ms98-a-0003 1.193625 3.058750 [silence]
sw3971B-ms98-a-0004 3.058750 8.872000 uh i like the Giants they got uh i probably didn't get into baseball until maybe
sw3971B-ms98-a-0005 8.872000 11.607375 maybe f[our]- three years ago really
sw3971B-ms98-a-0006 11.607375 21.290875 so uh but i- i i just like the Giants i d[on't]- i don't know why i really got into them_1 i read uh Dave Dreveki's book his autobiography and
sw3971B-ms98-a-0007 21.290875 23.726750 yeah that that was incredible
sw3971B-ms98-a-0008 23.726750 26.468500 [silence]
sw3971B-ms98-a-0009 26.468500 29.606875 the way he handled that entire situation yeah
sw3971B-ms98-a-0010 29.606875 30.984750 but
sw3971B-ms98-a-0011 30.984750 39.916375 i just think the Giants have a good team they they got all you know they're they're rea[l]- they're real balanced out they got real good pitching and they got the hitting to go along with it so
sw3971B-ms98-a-0012 39.916375 41.963625 [silence]
sw3971B-ms98-a-0013 41.963625 55.743750 yeah they just they need that i think they just need that one one element to push them_1 over the top you know i don't really know what it is but but every team that's that's really good seems you know like the A's had they had they just had it all that one year so
sw3971B-ms98-a-0014 55.743750 62.952875 [silence]
sw3971B-ms98-a-0015 62.952875 64.189000 yeah
sw3971B-ms98-a-0016 64.189000 65.844875 [silence]
sw3971B-ms98-a-0017 65.844875 67.046500 yeah
sw3971B-ms98-a-0018 67.046500 70.535125 [silence]
sw3971B-ms98-a-0019 70.535125 76.255750 yeah if you if you're a fan you got to stay with your team any way you know you good and the bad but
sw3971B-ms98-a-0020 76.255750 78.711250 it's it's kind of hard i still we[ll]-
sw3971B-ms98-a-0021 78.711250 91.375500 basically the the me and all my friends around here since we don't have anywhere i mean we can go to the Astros or the Rangers [laughter-teams] but since no[ne]- me or none of me and my friends are really really like either one of those teams so we uh
sw3971B-ms98-a-0022 91.375500 103.141500 about_1 the about the mo[st]- most baseball we get is either TV or we play it on Nintendo we play RBI baseball on Nintendo so so that's just you know that's small town trying to make it through the
sw3971B-ms98-a-0023 103.141500 106.532625 through the lu[ll]- not being around it really but
sw3971B-ms98-a-0024 106.532625 109.022125 [silence]
sw3971B-ms98-a-0025 109.022125 110.166750 yeah
sw3971B-ms98-a-0026 110.166750 111.173500 [silence]
sw3971B-ms98-a-0027 111.173500 114.670875 yeah so do i but baseball is still
sw3971B-ms98-a-0028 114.670875 118.235750 you go[t]- you got to do something when football ain't on so
sw3971B-ms98-a-0029 118.235750 119.508875 [silence]
sw3971B-ms98-a-0030 119.508875 123.490250 yeah exactly thi[s]- this is America so
sw3971B-ms98-a-0031 123.490250 124.841000 uh but
sw3971B-ms98-a-0032 124.841000 127.078250 [silence]
sw3971B-ms98-a-0033 127.078250 136.646750 uh i don't know it's hard to say i haven't really really you have to just keep up with everything in the off season it's kind of hard to do at least you know you have to read the paper and
sw3971B-ms98-a-0034 136.646750 147.623375 Sports Illustrated and everything to keep up with who they traded and who they picked up and and all that but like i say if they can if they can get that one element that they were missing i think the Giants can do it
sw3971B-ms98-a-0035 147.623375 157.100500 they just i don't you i don't really know about the A's i don't like the A's uh matter of fact i can't stand the Oakland [laughter-A's] just because they have that you know they've got their
sw3971B-ms98-a-0036 157.100500 162.184750 Jose Canseco and and all the attitude that goes along with that you know the kind of
sw3971B-ms98-a-0037 162.184750 170.605125 yeah you hear what you hear did you hear what he did he ramming his ca[r]- wife's car and i- i was like yeah see that's just
sw3971B-ms98-a-0038 170.605125 177.269875 yeah he's just a a a little boy with a lot of money so that's just you know but
sw3971B-ms98-a-0039 177.269875 179.499875 [noise]
sw3971B-ms98-a-0040 179.499875 180.509625 [silence]
sw3971B-ms98-a-0041 180.509625 182.961000 yeah i've heard i've heard talk about that
sw3971B-ms98-a-0042 182.961000 188.080250 [silence]
sw3971B-ms98-a-0043 188.080250 190.907250 yeah they're not gonna be happy about it
sw3971B-ms98-a-0044 190.907250 194.023125 but i hope they can do good i mean that's just
sw3971B-ms98-a-0045 194.023125 199.352625 i think they're a good team that just need that one one little thing to push them_1 over i don't know
sw3971B-ms98-a-0046 199.352625 209.358500 exactly what it is they got they're pretty balanced out all the way through it just might be the drive you know more than anything else they just they probably just need something to push them_1
sw3971B-ms98-a-0047 209.358500 218.735500 because i that's that's the only thing i can see that's holding them_1 back is the ambition to do it or somebody basically maybe they just need everybody to tell them_1 they can't do it
sw3971B-ms98-a-0048 218.735500 221.902250 maybe that's what you know that's what some teams need
sw3971B-ms98-a-0049 221.902250 225.187875 look at the Twins going from worst to first so
sw3971B-ms98-a-0050 225.187875 233.449000 yeah my roommate's a my roommate's a Twins fan for[ever]- forever so he had his year this year so
sw3971B-ms98-a-0051 233.449000 240.207500 we we got quite pre[occupied]- we we got into that a whole bunch that was a that was a series to remember for sure
sw3971B-ms98-a-0052 240.207500 245.229625 so i saw all seven games of that so that was definitely worth watching
sw3971B-ms98-a-0053 245.229625 247.468500 [silence]
sw3971B-ms98-a-0054 247.468500 248.731250 yeah
sw3971B-ms98-a-0055 248.731250 251.942250 [silence]
sw3971B-ms98-a-0056 251.942250 264.871250 [laughter] yeah they e[very]- every every team with the Indians been doing that now and it and it i can't figure out why i've yet to figure out why they're all doing that i'm like it doesn't work it's obvious it doesn't work because_1 the you know the Braves
sw3971B-ms98-a-0057 264.871250 269.512375 the Braves didn't win so uh why why keep on doing something that didn't work but
sw3971B-ms98-a-0058 269.512375 281.391625 i don't know i was i was kind of surprised that [vocalized-noise] we're gonna talk about baseball and i get a woman's voice i was i was i was thinking uh-huh i talked to a guy named Vinny last night about fixing your car so
sw3971B-ms98-a-0059 281.391625 287.421500 [laughter] yeah i got i called got a call the other night about about_1 fixing your automobile up so
sw3971B-ms98-a-0060 287.421500 288.663000 but
sw3971B-ms98-a-0061 288.663000 296.297875 well baseball baseball it's it's kind of i don't know it's kind of odd that they'd do you pick the topic or does the computer
