sw3998A-ms98-a-0011 15.348125 16.689875 [silence]
sw3998A-ms98-a-0012 16.689875 17.884000 okay
sw3998A-ms98-a-0013 17.884000 21.329875 so what do you think about the elderly and their health care
sw3998A-ms98-a-0014 21.329875 32.847500 [silence]
sw3998A-ms98-a-0015 32.847500 34.408500 uh-huh
sw3998A-ms98-a-0016 34.408500 44.363750 [silence]
sw3998A-ms98-a-0017 44.363750 47.449625 yeah i think that's really sad 
sw3998A-ms98-a-0018 47.449625 52.862875 [silence]
sw3998A-ms98-a-0019 52.862875 62.634500 yeah i have um my great grandmother was in one and i used to go visit her a lot i think it's sad because one it's so expensive
sw3998A-ms98-a-0020 62.634500 66.774750 just to put them in there and it's such a traumatic decision anyway
sw3998A-ms98-a-0021 66.774750 80.005500 and then it's like no one goes and sees them i think that's really sad i mean tha[t]- i didn't even think about that what i first was thinking about this topic and stuff and that's just that's that's amazes me you know
sw3998A-ms98-a-0022 80.005500 88.761875 [silence]
sw3998A-ms98-a-0023 88.761875 90.920750 no i don't think so
sw3998A-ms98-a-0024 90.920750 96.317375 [silence]
sw3998A-ms98-a-0025 96.317375 97.716500 uh-huh
sw3998A-ms98-a-0026 97.716500 101.097625 [silence]
sw3998A-ms98-a-0027 101.097625 104.080000 but they need someone to take care of them you know
sw3998A-ms98-a-0028 104.080000 115.824125 you can kind of see both sides i mean the people that have to be in one you know should be or people that are just put in one you know that do not need serious you know medical care i think that's kind of sad 
sw3998A-ms98-a-0029 115.824125 122.977375 [silence]
sw3998A-ms98-a-0030 122.977375 125.242500 yeah that's uh-huh
sw3998A-ms98-a-0031 125.242500 128.487875 [silence]
sw3998A-ms98-a-0032 128.487875 129.987750 yeah
sw3998A-ms98-a-0033 129.987750 131.444625 yeah
sw3998A-ms98-a-0034 131.444625 133.899250 should go back to that [laughter]
sw3998A-ms98-a-0035 133.899250 135.893875 think more people should do that
sw3998A-ms98-a-0036 135.893875 137.946750 [silence]
sw3998A-ms98-a-0037 137.946750 142.553875 hard as it may sound or be for some people it's not really that hard
sw3998A-ms98-a-0038 142.553875 143.566875 [silence]
sw3998A-ms98-a-0039 143.566875 145.733250 least it would be easier
sw3998A-ms98-a-0040 145.733250 150.867875 [silence]
sw3998A-ms98-a-0041 150.867875 153.466625 uh-huh that's true
sw3998A-ms98-a-0042 153.466625 157.831375 [silence]
sw3998A-ms98-a-0043 157.831375 160.932625 yeah there's going to be more older people [laughter]
sw3998A-ms98-a-0044 160.932625 164.198500 whether they like to admit it or not
sw3998A-ms98-a-0045 164.198500 169.136375 that's true though i didn't think about that either people got to think about that
sw3998A-ms98-a-0046 169.136375 182.314000 and just i just think it's it's kind of sad even knowing if your you know if your parents would even want to go in one or not you know i mean my parents are like no way i know there's no way they would ever want to be put in one
sw3998A-ms98-a-0047 182.314000 194.474875 and i know that my parents plan to take care of their parents you know if it ever gets to the point where they can't take care of themselves you know they're going to go to Florida or whatever to take care of them
sw3998A-ms98-a-0048 194.474875 199.196750 that's what they have to do because they don't want to just put them in a nursing home
sw3998A-ms98-a-0049 199.196750 201.610250 they don't think that's right
sw3998A-ms98-a-0050 201.610250 207.432375 [silence]
sw3998A-ms98-a-0051 207.432375 212.764000 i guess it would depend on a lot of things like like financial especially
sw3998A-ms98-a-0052 212.764000 222.291500 and depending on how old they are and how you know i can see if like my grandmother whose mother used to be in a nursing home she used to go up there and see her every day
sw3998A-ms98-a-0053 222.291500 235.682250 whose my great-grandmother was in one she used to go see her every day and that is great but when she got sick then you know she can't go see her and stuff and you can't expect so i guess it would depend on how old they were too
sw3998A-ms98-a-0054 235.682250 242.514750 because if if the p[arents]- if the children were too old to take care of the parents then
sw3998A-ms98-a-0055 242.514750 245.526750 i don't think that would be very good either
sw3998A-ms98-a-0056 245.526750 249.933000 [silence]
sw3998A-ms98-a-0057 249.933000 252.022250 pretty touchy topic
sw3998A-ms98-a-0058 252.022250 258.770125 [silence]
sw3998A-ms98-a-0059 258.770125 260.145125 oh yeah
sw3998A-ms98-a-0060 260.145125 262.027750 at least [laughter]
sw3998A-ms98-a-0061 262.027750 263.735000 they're pretty expensive
sw3998A-ms98-a-0062 263.735000 266.009500 [silence]
sw3998A-ms98-a-0063 266.009500 272.071500 but people always figure it as if they had a live in nurse too that's you know just as expensive
sw3998A-ms98-a-0064 272.071500 273.273500 [silence]
sw3998A-ms98-a-0065 273.273500 278.916125 it is because i know when my grandmother was looking to put her mother in
sw3998A-ms98-a-0066 278.916125 287.956250 that is a big ordeal she's like well it's just expensive to have a nurse twenty four hours a day than it is to put her in a a place where at least there's other people you know
sw3998A-ms98-a-0067 287.956250 297.662000 i mean and she went and saw her every day like i said and that's good i think because i don't think if you just put them in there and forget about them i don't think that's right
sw3998A-ms98-a-0068 297.662000 299.298000 think that's sad
