sw3991B-ms98-a-0009 15.215375 18.307875 [laughter] i've mixed feelings i guess you'd say

sw3991B-ms98-a-0011 25.654750 27.483125 but uh
sw3991B-ms98-a-0012 27.483125 41.318625 on the other hand you know the present alternatives at least in Texas are not real good i mean it's an all or nothing proposition you know you either you either uh give somebody a death penalty or
sw3991B-ms98-a-0013 41.318625 48.990375 they're out on the streets in a very short time to uh ha[ve]- have a repeat performance of whatever they did um
sw3991B-ms98-a-0014 48.990375 55.141875 and i guess uh you know i guess i should mention i'm an attorney and i used to do some criminal work and um
sw3991B-ms98-a-0015 55.141875 57.500125 as long as it's reserved for
sw3991B-ms98-a-0016 57.500125 65.665375 special purposes and as long as as uh you know the judicial process that's afforded to someone pretty much
sw3991B-ms98-a-0017 65.665375 73.002500 you know makes you feel good about that you've got the right guy then i guess i- i can live with it
sw3991B-ms98-a-0018 73.002500 75.085250 [silence]
sw3991B-ms98-a-0019 75.085250 82.348250 uh i haven't been keeping up with that i've been in and out of of town and i haven't kept up with it what's happening to him
sw3991B-ms98-a-0020 82.348250 84.125625 [silence]
sw3991B-ms98-a-0021 84.125625 90.500875 um-hum uh so they went ahead and ruled him uh at least legally sane to stand trial
sw3991B-ms98-a-0022 90.500875 92.065625 okay
sw3991B-ms98-a-0023 92.065625 98.937250 [silence]
sw3991B-ms98-a-0024 98.937250 101.919375 see we don't have that in Texas that's the problem
sw3991B-ms98-a-0025 101.919375 106.321250 is is you can't give somebody life without parole at least at this point
sw3991B-ms98-a-0026 106.321250 108.104750 [silence]
sw3991B-ms98-a-0027 108.104750 111.435250 no i mean you know uh a life sentence
sw3991B-ms98-a-0028 111.435250 122.035125 they get time and a half for um time served and uh if they get made a trustee they get good time um which is like two two days for every day they serve
sw3991B-ms98-a-0029 122.035125 129.600500 and they can really be out or eligible for parole in a fairly short space of time
sw3991B-ms98-a-0030 129.600500 135.028000 [silence]
sw3991B-ms98-a-0031 135.028000 137.322000 i want to say
sw3991B-ms98-a-0032 137.322000 138.807625 [silence]
sw3991B-ms98-a-0033 138.807625 145.137625 uh you know they've changed things since i used to since i used to practice that kind of work but i think that
sw3991B-ms98-a-0034 145.137625 150.969750 somebody told me that [noise] within ten or twelve years they would be um eligible for parole
sw3991B-ms98-a-0035 150.969750 153.167250 i mean it's not very long
sw3991B-ms98-a-0036 153.167250 162.527750 [silence]
sw3991B-ms98-a-0037 162.527750 163.691125 um-hum
sw3991B-ms98-a-0038 163.691125 165.281250 [silence]
sw3991B-ms98-a-0039 165.281250 172.364375 [noise] well see also in Texas it's real unusual for them to do what they call stack them stack the penalties
sw3991B-ms98-a-0040 172.364375 176.771125 they they will they will cause the penalties to run concurrently
sw3991B-ms98-a-0041 176.771125 180.065000 [silence]
sw3991B-ms98-a-0042 180.065000 190.420250 yeah i mean on on something like a like a Jeffrey Dahlmer or somebody like that you know that definitely i mean you know why go through the farce of having a parole hearing
sw3991B-ms98-a-0043 190.420250 200.745750 you know what's going to happen if you let him out i mean we and in Texas too i mean i smaller states like Vermont uh and places like that have some real innovative
sw3991B-ms98-a-0044 200.745750 208.632375 rehabilitation type activities that they can do in their penal system and in a in a state like Texas we don't have that
sw3991B-ms98-a-0045 208.632375 212.685375 they get down there we are warehousing people basically
sw3991B-ms98-a-0046 212.685375 225.839500 and they go down there and they [laughter-maybe] pick up a few tricks you know how to be worse and uh and then you turn them loose on society and i just don't think that that's i don't think that's right i don't think that's fair
sw3991B-ms98-a-0047 225.839500 227.415125 [silence]
sw3991B-ms98-a-0048 227.415125 228.585000 yeah
sw3991B-ms98-a-0049 228.585000 233.553000 [silence]
sw3991B-ms98-a-0050 233.553000 235.436000 something yeah
sw3991B-ms98-a-0051 235.436000 243.400125 [silence]
sw3991B-ms98-a-0052 243.400125 245.077000 uh it's a lot
sw3991B-ms98-a-0053 245.077000 248.371125 [silence]
sw3991B-ms98-a-0054 248.371125 249.529250 yeah

sw3991B-ms98-a-0056 251.009625 252.396000 huh-uh
sw3991B-ms98-a-0057 252.396000 266.749875 well and and if you consider the fact that with with all the the federal lawsuits that went on and all the standards that there are for how you can and cannot treat prisoners and and what they're entitled to have
sw3991B-ms98-a-0058 266.749875 274.529375 frankly you know it's it's considered cruel and inhumane for a prisoner at the state penitentiary
sw3991B-ms98-a-0059 274.529375 282.246500 to live in conditions that would look pretty attractive to some of the homeless people who have not committed a crime
sw3991B-ms98-a-0060 282.246500 289.798875 you know i mean we just our system is is is kind of skewed somehow or another
sw3991B-ms98-a-0061 289.798875 295.003750 and like i say i mean you know i ca[n't]- i can't tell you i feel good about the fact that we put people to death
sw3991B-ms98-a-0062 295.003750 298.018000 i mean i really uh you know deep down i guess that both[ers]-
