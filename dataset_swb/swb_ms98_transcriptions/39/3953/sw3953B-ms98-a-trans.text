sw3953B-ms98-a-0018 54.504000 61.231750 i think that law that they tried to pass i'm not even sure if they passed it or not the seven uh seven day waiting period
sw3953B-ms98-a-0019 61.231750 71.248875 i- i think that's a [vocalized-noise] a reasonable law and i'm not real sure why the NRA was against it um you know it it really didn't
sw3953B-ms98-a-0020 71.248875 74.782750 the only thing it restricted was that you couldn't pick up the gun right away
sw3953B-ms98-a-0021 74.782750 76.062750 um
sw3953B-ms98-a-0022 76.062750 83.468000 [silence]
sw3953B-ms98-a-0023 83.468000 87.757125 yeah seven days shouldn't be a a big a big deal

sw3953B-ms98-a-0027 92.069875 101.730250 and if you do you want the gun for [laughter] something else other than than shooting target because_1 you can always get a gun to go and shoot you know target with
sw3953B-ms98-a-0028 101.730250 114.543375 or you know even hunt you can borrow a gun to do that [vocalized-noise] but uh you know if you want it right away you you want it for a different reason than than the legitimate reason for having a gun 
sw3953B-ms98-a-0029 114.543375 124.717750 [silence]
sw3953B-ms98-a-0030 124.717750 132.995625 yeah it yeah and i- i wonder about that because the the the sale of automatic weapons because uh
sw3953B-ms98-a-0031 132.995625 139.012500 i mean how many [laughter] how many rounds does it take to kill a [laughter-deer] [laughter-if]
sw3953B-ms98-a-0032 139.012500 149.477375 if you need thirty shots to kill a deer you should be uh you you should be shooting with a camera [laughter] [laughter-because_1] you're dangerous [laughter-anyway] [laughter]
sw3953B-ms98-a-0033 149.477375 152.991250 that's [laughter-right] [laughter]
sw3953B-ms98-a-0034 152.991250 162.646125 so i yeah i guess we uh we kind of feel the same way about about that i uh it's it's funny because i was over at in McKinney the other day and picking up a dog
sw3953B-ms98-a-0035 162.646125 166.679000 and um and i saw some women um

sw3953B-ms98-a-0040 175.862125 183.654875 but um i it reminded me of uh you know i was listening to a talk show the other day and and heard that
sw3953B-ms98-a-0041 183.654875 190.613000 the majority of the accidents that happen or the shooting that happens happens right in the home with somebody that you know
sw3953B-ms98-a-0042 190.613000 192.879875 misuse of a gun

sw3953B-ms98-a-0048 211.282125 224.486875 a lot of that happened and yeah i- i don't i don't really see why the NRA would oppose i guess it's because they you know they don't want any any kind of uh of government restrictions on
sw3953B-ms98-a-0049 224.486875 238.129750 [silence]
