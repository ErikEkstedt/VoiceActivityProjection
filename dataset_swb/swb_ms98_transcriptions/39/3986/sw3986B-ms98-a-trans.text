sw3986B-ms98-a-0044 154.726500 164.189625 you know we we uh we were having that problem that why there's just not enough room those small cars any more f[or]- you know we couldn't go camping because we couldn't put a tent and a cooler in it you know it was so small

sw3986B-ms98-a-0054 190.693750 192.854125 they've had that for a while yeah
sw3986B-ms98-a-0055 192.854125 198.598625 well it says something they're willing at least put something behind it you know they're they feel like turning out a good product and they're at least
sw3986B-ms98-a-0056 198.598625 204.521250 yeah that warranty stuff that's uh i did have to take this company car in and the cassette jammed all of a sudden
sw3986B-ms98-a-0057 204.521250 214.408750 and it was nice to know that you know that warr[anty]- it was still under its warranty and they just took it and took care of it right on the spot but that's definitely something i think i'd shop for i'd want as much warranty as i could because
sw3986B-ms98-a-0058 214.408750 217.121500 it's expensive to get the things fixed anymore
sw3986B-ms98-a-0059 217.121500 218.782875 if it's not covered
sw3986B-ms98-a-0060 218.782875 224.063000 [silence]

sw3986B-ms98-a-0065 232.203625 234.298625 no they don't you know they
sw3986B-ms98-a-0066 234.298625 247.131000 yeah if you get something that's one or two years old uh you can usually knock i- i worked at a bank as a loan officer and so i could you know i got into that a little bit uh you know the dealership financing and stuff but 
sw3986B-ms98-a-0067 247.131000 261.171625 you know at two years makes a huge difference you know they say and it's pretty much true that you drive off the lot and you lose at least a thousand dollars as soon as you take that thing off the lot in value and the Hondas and some of those they don't depreciate as much but you can still get them_1 a little bit cheaper
sw3986B-ms98-a-0068 261.171625 271.284250 but i tell you wh[at]- it's kind of scary uh we bought our company car through an auction a dealer auction and the dealers they they get those things for about half of what they sell them_1
sw3986B-ms98-a-0069 271.284250 282.970000 couldn't believe it i uh we stickered the car i got this Grand Prix was stickered at uh sixteen thousand it was a ninety one and had uh had ten thousand miles on it but we ended up getting it for about ten 
sw3986B-ms98-a-0070 282.970000 294.336250 and i mean they bought it for ten they'll sell it for sixteen seventeen thousand i could not believe it had just if you know somebody that's the way to go but unfortunately only the dealers can get in [laughter] but uh
sw3986B-ms98-a-0071 294.336250 299.682000 i tell you i i've been real happy with the Hondas actually we had a have a nineteen eighty Honda Accord too
