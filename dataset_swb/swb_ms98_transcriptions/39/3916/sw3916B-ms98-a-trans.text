sw3916B-ms98-a-0002 3.985500 7.956000 well i we're sort of in the middle of it um
sw3916B-ms98-a-0003 7.956000 16.141250 last February we brought my mother from Florida to us here in Texas and so far she has been with us but
sw3916B-ms98-a-0004 16.141250 30.448250 i really look to the future that it may be [laughter-occurring] um i don't know what i'll do i i'm almost inclined to hire somebody um to be in our home with her rather than have to
sw3916B-ms98-a-0005 30.448250 33.389875 put her somewhere you know but
sw3916B-ms98-a-0006 33.389875 37.403625 [silence]
sw3916B-ms98-a-0007 37.403625 46.427625 well i think [vocalized-noise] partly and it's not me it's the it seems to me the older generation my mother and father a[nd]- my in-laws
sw3916B-ms98-a-0008 46.427625 53.116875 um you know the stigma used to be you went there and and you died and so they have all kind of
sw3916B-ms98-a-0009 53.116875 54.624750 [silence]
sw3916B-ms98-a-0010 54.624750 55.923250 right
sw3916B-ms98-a-0011 55.923250 57.967000 you know it just um
sw3916B-ms98-a-0012 57.967000 62.988250 and you try and say you know they're nice now or or nicer and [noise]
sw3916B-ms98-a-0013 62.988250 71.155375 you know i wouldn't want her in one in Florida because_1 i couldn't check on her but if she were in one near here i- i would probably be there
sw3916B-ms98-a-0014 71.155375 74.833125 you know several times per week and i would
sw3916B-ms98-a-0015 74.833125 81.387875 stand up and scream if i saw things that were you know [noise] improper or or uh you know her care was not
sw3916B-ms98-a-0016 81.387875 84.430875 [silence]
sw3916B-ms98-a-0017 84.430875 87.317250 have you had that experience yet
sw3916B-ms98-a-0018 87.317250 88.592875 well
sw3916B-ms98-a-0019 88.592875 90.035000 [silence]
sw3916B-ms98-a-0020 90.035000 91.420125 oh
sw3916B-ms98-a-0021 91.420125 98.119125 [silence]
sw3916B-ms98-a-0022 98.119125 99.697125 right
sw3916B-ms98-a-0023 99.697125 105.269500 it's uh well my father died several years ago and that was you know he had cancer and
sw3916B-ms98-a-0024 105.269500 116.019750 eventually the hospital comes and says you know your father uh c[are]- you know Medicare says he doesn't need the level of care to be hospitalized so you are going to
sw3916B-ms98-a-0025 116.019750 127.706875 eventually they'll come and tell you you will have two days to you know move him somewhere else and and that my mother and i needed to think what do we want to do at that point we did because he was 
sw3916B-ms98-a-0026 127.706875 141.550250 not yet comatose but real close and he lived two weeks in the nursing home so we did do that but um at at that time three and a half years ago my mother was in such a
sw3916B-ms98-a-0027 141.550250 148.305375 state of depression i didn't think she could handle even if we had full time around the clock care i didn't think
sw3916B-ms98-a-0028 148.305375 157.028875 emotionally she could handle him being there it [noise] well it yes that too you you know there is no question that uh
sw3916B-ms98-a-0029 157.028875 166.119375 just moving them about is um difficult but it really is and it's just uh and i have friends whose we're all in the age group where
sw3916B-ms98-a-0030 166.119375 171.204125 were thinking about some of these things for our parents and it really is uh
sw3916B-ms98-a-0031 171.204125 179.110375 [silence]
sw3916B-ms98-a-0032 179.110375 180.275125 with
sw3916B-ms98-a-0033 180.275125 183.006125 [silence]
sw3916B-ms98-a-0034 183.006125 192.953250 well of course this again was in Florida actually the level of care and in fact two that we looked at were you know they were all in mauve and blue and very elegant looking and
sw3916B-ms98-a-0035 192.953250 203.825750 and so on but i didn't like the fact that they had you know eight patients for one uh you know nurse or one care giver and the one we selected was not nearly as
sw3916B-ms98-a-0036 203.825750 216.248750 uh up to date however it was clean and the patients were well cared for and i like it because it had like a level of five to one and i felt that [noise] that would be 
sw3916B-ms98-a-0037 216.248750 223.203625 better care for my father uh and but several of her neighbors and friends oh but you ought to i said i know but
sw3916B-ms98-a-0038 223.203625 228.014125 we're making this decision and my mom basically let me make the decision so
sw3916B-ms98-a-0039 228.014125 233.050500 um and she was pleased with it because he did get um
sw3916B-ms98-a-0040 233.050500 235.337125 you know just wonderful care
sw3916B-ms98-a-0041 235.337125 236.359500 [silence]
sw3916B-ms98-a-0042 236.359500 247.389375 oh absolutely i don't care what you know one of these had a little ice cream parlor and i looked at the manager i said my father you know will never get out of a bed i don't care about a ice cream parlor
sw3916B-ms98-a-0043 247.389375 251.943000 you know if you went there and you were in your seventies and well you just went there
sw3916B-ms98-a-0044 251.943000 257.115750 to a you know retirement center yes you could do all that good stuff but this was
sw3916B-ms98-a-0045 257.115750 265.613250 i wanted him cared for and and not left uh you know if he spoiled his linens or something i did not want that
sw3916B-ms98-a-0046 265.613250 272.727250 you know there what do you do in a hospital work with okay all right
sw3916B-ms98-a-0047 272.727250 296.531000 [silence]
