sw3925B-ms98-a-0002 11.160125 21.657250 okay you're asking what my opinion about whether [laughter-it's] [laughter-possible] to have honesty in government [noise] well i suspect that it is possible uh i think it probably
sw3925B-ms98-a-0003 21.657250 26.815625 is more likely if you have a small government unit where everybody knows everybody
sw3925B-ms98-a-0004 26.815625 28.578000 [silence]
sw3925B-ms98-a-0005 28.578000 30.211500 but um
sw3925B-ms98-a-0006 30.211500 31.266125 [silence]
sw3925B-ms98-a-0007 31.266125 35.694750 other than that i think maybe it just depends on how you define honesty
sw3925B-ms98-a-0008 35.694750 63.804125 [silence]
sw3925B-ms98-a-0009 63.804125 69.650375 um-hum so they're saying that government officials would tend to be power seekers b[ut]-

sw3925B-ms98-a-0012 75.394750 84.604375 [silence]
sw3925B-ms98-a-0013 84.604375 93.535125 right yeah but i think maybe a lot of them um say the more honest ones who are still looking out for themselves it may be more a matter of [noise]
sw3925B-ms98-a-0014 93.535125 102.125375 not what can i steal while i'm in office but how many friends can i make while i'm in office and [noise] you know how good a name can i make for myself and so forth
sw3925B-ms98-a-0015 102.125375 109.083625 so i guess it would be like anything else the president of General Motors probably has the same [laughter]
sw3925B-ms98-a-0016 109.083625 124.872500 [silence]
sw3925B-ms98-a-0017 124.872500 126.451375 i think i'm

sw3925B-ms98-a-0019 132.423875 143.449750 i think a little more honesty in campaigns would be more to the point if you knew what you were getting when you voted uh [laughter] yeah
sw3925B-ms98-a-0020 143.449750 156.598500 [silence]

sw3925B-ms98-a-0028 186.104500 196.996500 yeah and it almost seems like in order to avoid uh some of this scandal you would have to have the kind of life that you would only find in a say in the Bobsy Twins or something like that [laughter]
sw3925B-ms98-a-0029 196.996500 198.597125 [laughter]

sw3925B-ms98-a-0040 264.114375 278.425500 [noise] actually i think other countries may have it worse uh the Japanese government is always having a some kind of a scandal usually involving the Prime Minister or people very close to him it's so uh
