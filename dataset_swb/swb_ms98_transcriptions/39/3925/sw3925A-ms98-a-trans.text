sw3925A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.027375 [noise] -[o]kay 
sw3925A-ms98-a-0002 1.027375 8.304125 i think the first thing they said i've written this down so it would is it p[ossible]- do you think it's possible to have honesty in government
sw3925A-ms98-a-0003 8.304125 10.636750 or an honest government
sw3925A-ms98-a-0004 10.636750 13.465125 [silence]
sw3925A-ms98-a-0005 13.465125 14.967750 yeah
sw3925A-ms98-a-0006 14.967750 25.873625 [silence]
sw3925A-ms98-a-0007 25.873625 28.104125 right that's a good point
sw3925A-ms98-a-0008 28.104125 36.322625 [silence]
sw3925A-ms98-a-0009 36.322625 43.766125 that's an int[eresting]- yeah that's interesting i had read something one time and it was just applying to governments in general it was written many years ago
sw3925A-ms98-a-0010 43.766125 46.737625 it said that is impossible to have
sw3925A-ms98-a-0011 46.737625 56.154500 a completely honest system of government because people who choose government for their positions are power seekers
sw3925A-ms98-a-0012 56.154500 58.457750 and i thought that was interesting
sw3925A-ms98-a-0013 58.457750 65.743500 it wasn't just talking about our government it was just government in general from times past you know on and
sw3925A-ms98-a-0014 65.743500 67.566750 [silence]
sw3925A-ms98-a-0015 67.566750 76.965500 right and that would be a next question to ask how many do you think are in there for pub[lic]- for but because they wanna be of service to us
sw3925A-ms98-a-0016 76.965500 84.431500 or are they in there for their own gains and personally i feel it's probably there's probably some of each
sw3925A-ms98-a-0017 84.431500 94.233750 [silence]
sw3925A-ms98-a-0018 94.233750 95.458625 [noise]

sw3925A-ms98-a-0024 106.529250 108.563875 oh yeah
sw3925A-ms98-a-0025 108.563875 122.431500 and they talked uh the other let's see third question was how m[uch]- how much self-serving for their own gains do you think goes on then they that's hard to answ[er]- i'm sure there's a lot but i agree with you there's a lot in business i think that's just
sw3925A-ms98-a-0026 122.431500 124.951875 i think that's very normal
sw3925A-ms98-a-0027 124.951875 129.680500 that we should not ex[pect]- i mean i think we put too much on politicians we expect them_1
sw3925A-ms98-a-0028 129.680500 132.944375 to only be there to serve us you know
sw3925A-ms98-a-0029 132.944375 134.993125 [silence]
sw3925A-ms98-a-0030 134.993125 136.181750 yeah

sw3925A-ms98-a-0034 142.870875 144.014625 [silence]
sw3925A-ms98-a-0035 144.014625 148.128250 it's interesting because_1 i'm taking a Texas government class right now and
sw3925A-ms98-a-0036 148.128250 154.109250 one of the things i always reali[ze]- it's so easy to blame them to b[lame]- a lot of times i think it's our own fault
sw3925A-ms98-a-0037 154.109250 158.496000 they lie to us because we don't wanna hear the truth and if
sw3925A-ms98-a-0038 158.496000 161.957875 if they tell us the truth we don't elect them_1 and
sw3925A-ms98-a-0039 161.957875 166.261625 especially with all this front co[ver]- stuff coming up here lately
sw3925A-ms98-a-0040 166.261625 172.980625 about people's past and i don't know why anybody would wanna get under that scrutiny anymore
sw3925A-ms98-a-0041 172.980625 174.996750 [silence]
sw3925A-ms98-a-0042 174.996750 182.264500 because it's i think it's gotten just care[less]- well we're not talking about issues we're talking about somebody's personal life and
sw3925A-ms98-a-0043 182.264500 185.470875 and we're getting away from what we ought to be looking at

sw3925A-ms98-a-0047 196.020375 206.407750 you know i also think it'd be funny if we could kn[ow]- know everything about the people that were in there and threw them_1 out i don't think there would be too many [laughter-left] [laughter-you] [laughter-know]
sw3925A-ms98-a-0048 206.407750 207.574125 [silence]

sw3925A-ms98-a-0052 219.465375 229.536500 and they also you know ask can we eliminate do you think we could make laws to eliminate all corruption and i don't think we can make laws to eliminate anything anyplace totally
sw3925A-ms98-a-0053 229.536500 230.577000 [silence]
sw3925A-ms98-a-0054 230.577000 235.701750 yeah but that doesn't mean i don't think making laws will
sw3925A-ms98-a-0055 235.701750 237.330875 stop it
sw3925A-ms98-a-0056 237.330875 241.694625 i mean i don't know how many laws you'd have to have i mean you know [noise]

sw3925A-ms98-a-0058 242.749625 245.259000 no sure didn't did it
sw3925A-ms98-a-0059 245.259000 253.353250 so no i think you can legislate but i think there's no way that you'd eliminated all by legislating and we'd end up with so many more laws that
sw3925A-ms98-a-0060 253.353250 254.587000 [silence]
sw3925A-ms98-a-0061 254.587000 260.285250 you know i mean i just think that's human nature that you're gonna have corruption
sw3925A-ms98-a-0062 260.285250 265.211250 in government in business personal life i mean you know
