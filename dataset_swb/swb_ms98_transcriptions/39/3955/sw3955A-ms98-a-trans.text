sw3955A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.730875 [noise]
sw3955A-ms98-a-0002 0.730875 7.446000 okay_1 well in the organized [vocalized-noise] i'm with Department of Defense and uh we have random drug testing
sw3955A-ms98-a-0003 7.446000 9.449250 and uh
sw3955A-ms98-a-0004 9.449250 18.024625 the last couple of years and people have really you just accepted that of course the soldiers and then uh the civilians they haven't done the civilians yet but
sw3955A-ms98-a-0005 18.024625 27.313125 personally i don't think see anything wrong with it uh i think it's a protection to employers and to employees and everybody else if
sw3955A-ms98-a-0006 27.313125 35.472750 [silence]
sw3955A-ms98-a-0007 35.472750 36.477750 uh-huh
sw3955A-ms98-a-0008 36.477750 42.318125 [silence]
sw3955A-ms98-a-0009 42.318125 43.791000 you bet
sw3955A-ms98-a-0010 43.791000 50.480625 i really like it the way they do it in the in the military they go by social security numbers and they take the last number and uh
sw3955A-ms98-a-0011 50.480625 51.959625 so it uh
sw3955A-ms98-a-0012 51.959625 59.965375 and i[t]- it or or just pick a last number social security numbers uh and that's the way they do it and it works really well
sw3955A-ms98-a-0013 59.965375 64.462750 and um i work with recruiters a lot and they have uh
sw3955A-ms98-a-0014 64.462750 67.489875 they have it monthly with recruiters
sw3955A-ms98-a-0015 67.489875 68.619750 [silence]
sw3955A-ms98-a-0016 68.619750 74.934250 uh no no uh they do it that way but uh well it's every three months excuse me every three months
sw3955A-ms98-a-0017 74.934250 82.174750 and they have uh we have about um oh a hundred and fifteen recruiters in our area
sw3955A-ms98-a-0018 82.174750 90.357750 and uh they have [vocalized-noise] a fourth of them_1 every three months they on a random basis
sw3955A-ms98-a-0019 90.357750 91.501250 but uh
sw3955A-ms98-a-0020 91.501250 92.621375 [silence]
sw3955A-ms98-a-0021 92.621375 96.745500 no no hasn't come up i don't know i
sw3955A-ms98-a-0022 96.745500 103.498375 that's fine if it does i [laughter] the only thing you have to be careful if i know all those who join the service
sw3955A-ms98-a-0023 103.498375 107.504375 uh it is mandatory that they're tested for drugs
sw3955A-ms98-a-0024 107.504375 111.919000 and uh if drugs are found uh in the system
sw3955A-ms98-a-0025 111.919000 121.973000 then uh they're barred for enlistment for six months and then they can come back once and test again and if it's uh still positive then they can't join
sw3955A-ms98-a-0026 121.973000 131.177625 they've really cracked down on that and uh i think that's that's good because the source of the bad crime of reputation for for drugs
sw3955A-ms98-a-0027 131.177625 137.706625 but it's surprising uh since they've been on well the first couple of months this has been around for about a year and a half
sw3955A-ms98-a-0028 137.706625 150.471250 the first few months there was quite a few that were disqualified and uh since then you just never hear of it i guess the word got out and the kids know that if they want to commit and and join then uh they have to be straight
sw3955A-ms98-a-0029 150.471250 156.803250 the only thing that's kind of scary if you eat one of these buns with cinnamon with these uh poppy seeds on it
sw3955A-ms98-a-0030 156.803250 159.330875 and that would show up
sw3955A-ms98-a-0031 159.330875 163.355500 no [laughter] no i[t's]- it's uh
sw3955A-ms98-a-0032 163.355500 169.592375 it's kind of strange uh but uh yeah they they tell them_1 that if they uh
sw3955A-ms98-a-0033 169.592375 173.980875 if they're going to if they come into the motel to stay overnight
sw3955A-ms98-a-0034 173.980875 185.792375 prior to being physical and tested and then so forth they tell them_1 not to eat anything with poppy seeds on it a hard roll if they're having lunch or something or dinner but
sw3955A-ms98-a-0035 185.792375 190.454875 well i'm not sure and it just shows that they're uh uh
sw3955A-ms98-a-0036 190.454875 200.357125 but they they specify that or just tell them_1 that they'll have to kind of be careful well and it's the same with alcoholic beverages they they test for that too
sw3955A-ms98-a-0037 200.357125 204.342375 and uh i think it's great i really do i mean
sw3955A-ms98-a-0038 204.342375 213.111875 but in the work place i i feel that it it should be uh something that the employers have the right to do if they want
sw3955A-ms98-a-0039 213.111875 215.869000 to protect everyone concerned and
sw3955A-ms98-a-0040 215.869000 222.149625 the the only problem i can see and i've heard is the the fact that if they uh
sw3955A-ms98-a-0041 222.149625 230.014375 if the test whoever runs the test they've got to make sure they run it correctly so it's not a a misreading on it or something
sw3955A-ms98-a-0042 230.014375 233.772250 and that that's happened in some instances i guess
sw3955A-ms98-a-0043 233.772250 235.454750 but uh
sw3955A-ms98-a-0044 235.454750 243.757375 i think they're pretty well i've hear[d]- what i've heard and especially the ones that that test the the soldiers they uh
sw3955A-ms98-a-0045 243.757375 252.389625 they make sure they they run them_1 correctly and uh have the right right person with right sample and everything but
sw3955A-ms98-a-0046 252.389625 254.215000 [silence]
sw3955A-ms98-a-0047 254.215000 255.682250 so
sw3955A-ms98-a-0048 255.682250 262.783125 [silence]
sw3955A-ms98-a-0049 262.783125 263.903000 uh-huh

sw3955A-ms98-a-0053 285.004125 294.378375 yeah i especially the the uh alcoholi[c]- alcohol part of it uh that's a that's a thing that uh
sw3955A-ms98-a-0054 294.378375 298.178000 yeah right you really can you can and uh
