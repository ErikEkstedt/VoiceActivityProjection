sw3958A-ms98-a-0017 73.425250 78.669625 it is you know i think the problem for me has always been trying to find a time of day that's going to work um
sw3958A-ms98-a-0018 78.669625 83.786000 i think probably the best way to get it done is to do it in the morning but i'm not a morning person
sw3958A-ms98-a-0019 83.786000 88.531250 and if i try to wait till the end of the day when i think i have a little bit more time i don't always have the energy level

sw3958A-ms98-a-0024 98.063000 101.065750 you get home and you start fixing dinner or whatever
sw3958A-ms98-a-0025 101.065750 108.094125 um i've tried to do a combination of stretching and and strengthening because my problem has been
sw3958A-ms98-a-0026 108.094125 112.469375 keeping strong i think enough i i tend if i don't
sw3958A-ms98-a-0027 112.469375 116.660000 i tend to have over stretched muscles in fact it's called a hypomobility
sw3958A-ms98-a-0028 116.660000 123.498375 but if i don't keep strong enough i can pull a muscle more easily say if i go on vacation
sw3958A-ms98-a-0029 123.498375 127.191125 uh and pick up some heavy suitcases it might stretch a muscle that
sw3958A-ms98-a-0030 127.191125 133.659875 would not have felt injured if i had kept the muscle strong enough to really support the joints so

sw3958A-ms98-a-0032 135.002375 136.194625 that's

sw3958A-ms98-a-0034 143.787625 154.644000 i'm definitely going to because i work at a hospital where there is a physical therapy department and i've used their barbells for a long while but i know i need to get more regular and do it at home so if i
sw3958A-ms98-a-0035 154.644000 159.829875 purchase my own i think i'm more inclined to do so and they're a good price
sw3958A-ms98-a-0036 159.829875 172.310875 [silence]
sw3958A-ms98-a-0037 172.310875 174.121250 see i can't do that

sw3958A-ms98-a-0055 222.528750 231.765125 it's interesting some people choose to go to classes because they feel that that will maintain their motivation they've either invested the money in it or there're people there that expect them or
sw3958A-ms98-a-0056 231.765125 238.010750 whatever but i think it's just the opposite with me i i need to have the flexibility to do it on my own time and yet
