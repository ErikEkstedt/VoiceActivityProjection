sw3909A-ms98-a-0018 54.993875 60.168250 [silence]
sw3909A-ms98-a-0019 60.168250 71.783625 yeah i agree with that but that's [noise] coming from because_1 i'm in college right now and seeing how the school systems are my mom's a teacher that's very hard to do in some areas you know it's like they sent
sw3909A-ms98-a-0020 71.783625 77.077000 and i know where my mom teaches you know and she teaches in like a lower class
sw3909A-ms98-a-0021 77.077000 87.541250 part of Plano and where it is is they just send their kids to school and you know they don't care if they do their homework if they don't do their homework whatever
sw3909A-ms98-a-0022 87.541250 96.004750 so she says it's very hard from that aspect i mean she'll call the parents and they you know they're like w[ell]- you know that's not my responsibility it's yours
sw3909A-ms98-a-0023 96.004750 104.053625 and i know she gets real frustrated being a teacher that she feels like you know that the parents aren't willing to do that which is very scary i think
sw3909A-ms98-a-0024 104.053625 114.313750 ano[ther]- another thing i think though is uh i know now because_1 i'm getting ready to graduate and friends of mine that are getting teaching degrees are um
sw3909A-ms98-a-0025 114.313750 121.945875 people that aren't getting a master's are having an easier time uh getting a job because_1 they can get paid less
sw3909A-ms98-a-0026 121.945875 133.847750 and it seems like they're just compromising good qualified educated teachers just for someone they can pay less and they get [laughter-they] [laughter-don't] get paid much now and i think that's really bad
sw3909A-ms98-a-0027 133.847750 141.988125 [silence]
sw3909A-ms98-a-0028 141.988125 143.513625 uh-huh
sw3909A-ms98-a-0029 143.513625 146.891750 [silence]
sw3909A-ms98-a-0030 146.891750 148.450250 yeah
sw3909A-ms98-a-0031 148.450250 160.466875 [silence]
sw3909A-ms98-a-0032 160.466875 163.720625 yeah uh-huh i think it was
sw3909A-ms98-a-0033 163.720625 187.091750 [silence]
sw3909A-ms98-a-0034 187.091750 188.486500 uh-huh

sw3909A-ms98-a-0038 192.651000 205.025000 i think it's hard though because_1 even like the like in high school and stuff you take the standardized tests and stuff and i know people that you know are like dysle[xic]- i mean i know people in college that are like dyslexic
sw3909A-ms98-a-0039 205.025000 210.954250 that i wonder how they pass through all their school you know all their years of school
sw3909A-ms98-a-0040 210.954250 223.632250 and pass through all the tests that they had to pass through and so forth to get to college because_1 they have the hardest time you know [noise] things like that always make me wonder too i mean they make all these tests but are they really proving anything
sw3909A-ms98-a-0041 223.632250 227.761875 [silence]
sw3909A-ms98-a-0042 227.761875 230.577250 yeah that's definitely true

sw3909A-ms98-a-0050 260.831125 268.511875 yeah i agree i think there's just so many problems now with [noise] just kids you know younger these days and
sw3909A-ms98-a-0051 268.511875 277.437625 all the problems they have and all the problems like in general in the world like with gangs and stuff just being brought into the school is making it worse i think that's not even helping at all
