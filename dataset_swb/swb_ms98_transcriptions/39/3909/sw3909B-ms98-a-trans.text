sw3909B-ms98-a-0033 150.835875 161.341750 there are some times i think that uh you know the quality of teachers may be improved upon i think what they did a few years ago was kind of a joke about testing the teachers and all
sw3909B-ms98-a-0034 161.341750 167.001625 um i think that [noise] i think that they're made some changes you know into um
sw3909B-ms98-a-0035 167.001625 176.505125 the the kind of courses that should be involved in education curriculum and um trying to i[mprove]- improve upon them uh somewhat but
sw3909B-ms98-a-0036 176.505125 190.674250 [noise] um they've never really paid you know real well and and you know people have to [noise] pick a an occupation that's gonna support themselves it can't be all sacrifice and no you know salary [laughter] you got to live on something

sw3909B-ms98-a-0047 223.764875 229.494750 [noise] yeah true and you know some people are much better test takers than others um
sw3909B-ms98-a-0048 229.494750 241.694875 some people you know um just really clam up when it comes to a test and they're so nervous about well is there a is this a trick question and instead of being real straight forward and just trying to answer it they
sw3909B-ms98-a-0049 241.694875 246.602500 um [laughter-give] [laughter-themselves] you know worse grade because they were so anxious about it
sw3909B-ms98-a-0050 246.602500 251.722000 and then other people you know aren't that upset about it and they test very well so there has to be
sw3909B-ms98-a-0051 251.722000 261.346750 different ways of of testing sometimes you know because um that isn't always a real good reflection of if the person's learned it or not
sw3909B-ms98-a-0052 261.346750 277.175750 [silence]
