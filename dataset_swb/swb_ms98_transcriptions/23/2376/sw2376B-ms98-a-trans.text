sw2376B-ms98-a-0010 27.093875 32.190250 yeah we [laughter-do] we have two a two year old and a three year old and so it really builds up with us
sw2376B-ms98-a-0011 32.190250 36.157125 [silence]
sw2376B-ms98-a-0012 36.157125 37.711250 yeah

sw2376B-ms98-a-0014 47.199750 51.042250 oh yeah that would be much more convenient yeah
sw2376B-ms98-a-0015 51.042250 53.321875 [silence]
sw2376B-ms98-a-0016 53.321875 54.937250 yeah

sw2376B-ms98-a-0020 59.067000 62.004625 or it just builds up so often yeah
sw2376B-ms98-a-0021 62.004625 65.817125 [silence]
sw2376B-ms98-a-0022 65.817125 67.943125 yeah yeah
sw2376B-ms98-a-0023 67.943125 68.984000 [silence]
sw2376B-ms98-a-0024 68.984000 78.241750 they used to have several places um that were a little ways out in the community that did the paper and all and they stopped doing it because they said it wasn't profitable
sw2376B-ms98-a-0025 78.241750 89.586625 so finally um they the people put so much pressure on the city they did a survey of everybody and they took a big huge bin that has paper and plastic
sw2376B-ms98-a-0026 89.586625 96.537750 um and put it in front of the Wal-Mart store in town and th[ey]- they it just really e[very]- e[very]- every time you went by there it was just over flowing
sw2376B-ms98-a-0027 96.537750 98.768000 and so Wal-Mart [laughter-complained]
sw2376B-ms98-a-0028 98.768000 105.439500 so they moved it behind the store and nobody knew where it was and so people kept piling stuff in the same place where it used to be
sw2376B-ms98-a-0029 105.439500 113.503875 oh it was just like a dump there and so finally you know i called and the[y]- they said you know it was behind there and i started taking my things behind there
sw2376B-ms98-a-0030 113.503875 121.600500 so we do that with because we have milk cartons you know constantly with two little kids and the paper but it just builds up it would be so nice if they had it
sw2376B-ms98-a-0031 121.600500 128.720125 you know at your home where you could just turn it in so they they final had enough of a response that they decided to try a small target area
sw2376B-ms98-a-0032 128.720125 134.640125 in one neighborhood and they have pickup there it's uh i think once or twice a week
sw2376B-ms98-a-0033 134.640125 144.270375 and the first couple weeks they did it nobody got their stuff out so they had not much participation and they were going to cancel it but then finally people started getting the message
sw2376B-ms98-a-0034 144.270375 147.766125 yeah and i think that you know if they can get enough going
sw2376B-ms98-a-0035 147.766125 155.881875 they'll continue it you know throughout the rest of the city but it's not i think originally people thought it would be profitable for cities to do this and it's not going to be [laughter-i] [laughter-don't] [laughter-think]
sw2376B-ms98-a-0036 155.881875 157.491500 [noise] yeah
sw2376B-ms98-a-0037 157.491500 159.258625 [silence]
sw2376B-ms98-a-0038 159.258625 169.332875 yeah i do to because it's amazing how much you know trash we can generate i know this year we took our Christmas tree they had a place in the park where you could go have your tree shredded and they gave you a little
sw2376B-ms98-a-0039 169.332875 172.813625 um seedling to plant you know [laughter] you could take the the
sw2376B-ms98-a-0040 172.813625 177.097750 mulch home with you you know and take buckets of that home so that was really good idea i thought
sw2376B-ms98-a-0041 177.097750 181.251500 [silence]
sw2376B-ms98-a-0042 181.251500 182.693500 yeah
sw2376B-ms98-a-0043 182.693500 183.917375 [silence]
sw2376B-ms98-a-0044 183.917375 188.451875 oh yeah it's really it adds up so fast yeah
sw2376B-ms98-a-0045 188.451875 193.543000 [silence]
sw2376B-ms98-a-0046 193.543000 203.394375 yeah well they're working on diapers which would be great i've read so many different things about diapers and now their saying that uh originally they thought the disposables were just awful 
sw2376B-ms98-a-0047 203.394375 212.271250 but now their saying that they're there really not that much in comparison to the others because you don't have to use the water to wash them and you know all different kinds of things too so
sw2376B-ms98-a-0048 212.271250 219.550000 the the diaper service trucks apparently the fuel that they use and the fumes that they produce to deliver and drop those [laughter-off]
sw2376B-ms98-a-0049 219.550000 231.160250 so i don't know what's the you know right thing to do but i really would hope that they would come up i know there was a brand just briefly on the market that was recyclable but the landfill have to do something special you know for those
sw2376B-ms98-a-0050 231.160250 235.249375 but that just generates a tremendous of volume of trash too so
sw2376B-ms98-a-0051 235.249375 236.652625 yeah
sw2376B-ms98-a-0052 236.652625 238.709375 [silence]
sw2376B-ms98-a-0053 238.709375 240.268750 yeah
sw2376B-ms98-a-0054 240.268750 242.542875 [silence]
sw2376B-ms98-a-0055 242.542875 251.336625 it does and you just feel guilty if you [laughter-don't] [laughter-do] something with them you know because you hate to contribute to the problem but on the on the other hand the alternatives [laughter-aren't] [laughter-to] [laughter-great] [laughter-either]
sw2376B-ms98-a-0056 251.336625 252.529500 [laughter]
sw2376B-ms98-a-0057 252.529500 266.470000 yeah i don't know what else they could recycle more of i guess we don't really use that many tin cans i guess there's some places where you can recycle aluminum but i don't know about like cans that you keep vegetables and stuff in i don't know if those are recyclable or
sw2376B-ms98-a-0058 266.470000 267.743625 um
sw2376B-ms98-a-0059 267.743625 270.383000 [silence]
sw2376B-ms98-a-0060 270.383000 272.091125 yeah
sw2376B-ms98-a-0061 272.091125 273.987500 yeah we don't either
sw2376B-ms98-a-0062 273.987500 278.250000 we usually use frozen vegetables and things so we don't really have much of that but
sw2376B-ms98-a-0063 278.250000 281.271625 [silence]
sw2376B-ms98-a-0064 281.271625 288.026750 yeah well now when we lived out in California they actually had places where you could recycle if you change the oil in your car
sw2376B-ms98-a-0065 288.026750 293.820375 or for aerosol cans and things like that because they say it's not safe to put those things in the regular trash
sw2376B-ms98-a-0066 293.820375 295.765375 yeah yeah
sw2376B-ms98-a-0067 295.765375 297.321125 [silence]

sw2376B-ms98-a-0071 301.390500 305.951750 well other than that i'm not really sure we we try to recycle old clothes
sw2376B-ms98-a-0072 305.951750 307.062875 [laughter]
sw2376B-ms98-a-0073 307.062875 312.073750 our church has a place where you can take them and they you know pass them on to other families so
sw2376B-ms98-a-0074 312.073750 314.083750 yeah yeah
sw2376B-ms98-a-0075 314.083750 318.265125 [silence]

sw2376B-ms98-a-0083 341.115375 344.295125 [silence]
