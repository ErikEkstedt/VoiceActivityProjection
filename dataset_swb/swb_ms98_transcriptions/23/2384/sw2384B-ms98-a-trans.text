sw2384B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 10.360375 yeah auto repair tends to be a a topic that a lot of people don't uh don't like i guess because_1 it's usually expensive and uh people end up
sw2384B-ms98-a-0002 10.360375 22.699375 not pleased with the job sometimes or not pleased with what they had to pay for it so uh i guess it's kind of a sour grapes type topic i just recently had um
sw2384B-ms98-a-0003 22.699375 32.819875 put a set of brakes on my little Blazer that we have and fortunately i- i could do most of the work myself but uh this last time that i
sw2384B-ms98-a-0004 32.819875 44.867250 got into it i got about halfway into it and started feeling a little bad i kind of {fluish} type and said what a time for this to set in i got the wheel off i got these brake pads off i got car jacked up and
sw2384B-ms98-a-0005 44.867250 48.055125 need the car the next day type deal so
sw2384B-ms98-a-0006 48.055125 59.037875 yeah so uh i continued on and just decided to do part of what i had intended to do when i got inside there which means that when i just get around to doing the rest of it i got to take all of that back off again and
sw2384B-ms98-a-0007 59.037875 68.713625 and uh start over so uh with little things like that it's it's still a lot cheaper uh that particular job for that particular model car runs a hundred and fifty dollars
sw2384B-ms98-a-0008 68.713625 69.974625 [silence]
sw2384B-ms98-a-0009 69.974625 78.215250 yeah just the front little disc pads but uh while you're in there you usually uh pull the rotor and and uh turn [noise] it down and and
sw2384B-ms98-a-0010 78.215250 83.207125 put the uh grease the bearings up since it's been a while since they'd been done and
sw2384B-ms98-a-0011 83.207125 86.911250 [silence]
sw2384B-ms98-a-0012 86.911250 87.851125 um-hum
sw2384B-ms98-a-0013 87.851125 90.511875 [silence]
sw2384B-ms98-a-0014 90.511875 91.763375 um-hum
sw2384B-ms98-a-0015 91.763375 95.086625 [silence]
sw2384B-ms98-a-0016 95.086625 105.689125 yeah the rear brakes just doing the just putting the brake pads in wouldn't be too expensive but it's when while you're in the front that you usually go ahead and pull those
sw2384B-ms98-a-0017 105.689125 116.103125 that rotor off and repack the bearings and you know that's twenty five dollars and the rotors another twenty five dollars and then the brake pads are eighty or something the labor and parts and
sw2384B-ms98-a-0018 116.103125 121.241375 i just go buy the things for for uh about thirty bucks and put them_1 on myself
sw2384B-ms98-a-0019 121.241375 132.975125 but uh it's a bit of a bit of a pain and you have to schedule it you know get around to find a weekend you can do it and all but still for the for the savings it uh works out usually
sw2384B-ms98-a-0020 132.975125 142.296375 [silence]
sw2384B-ms98-a-0021 142.296375 144.072250 um-hum
sw2384B-ms98-a-0022 144.072250 153.105875 [silence]
sw2384B-ms98-a-0023 153.105875 154.699750 um-hum
sw2384B-ms98-a-0024 154.699750 161.392500 [silence]
sw2384B-ms98-a-0025 161.392500 163.623875 oh boy bet that got warm
sw2384B-ms98-a-0026 163.623875 167.342125 [silence]
sw2384B-ms98-a-0027 167.342125 168.868625 yeah
sw2384B-ms98-a-0028 168.868625 171.187125 [silence]
sw2384B-ms98-a-0029 171.187125 175.283375 yeah that'll do it it'll cook the whole whole insides there
sw2384B-ms98-a-0030 175.283375 177.999500 hum i don't know what the
sw2384B-ms98-a-0031 177.999500 187.791000 what the solution for that would have been you would have thought [vocalized-noise] they'd have put all those parts that were pertaining to that near the brake so if they did get hot they'd unfreeze [laughter]
sw2384B-ms98-a-0032 187.791000 190.991500 that would be nice if uh all that was
sw2384B-ms98-a-0033 190.991500 193.245375 huh that's interesting
sw2384B-ms98-a-0034 193.245375 198.822250 yeah i'm glad we don't have that problem too often down here i've heard a lot of horror stories about people that
sw2384B-ms98-a-0035 198.822250 212.502750 go down a straight road long enough and the and the wheel wells ice up enough inside where you get ready to make a turn and and surprise you can't turn and you can't stop in a hurry and no i'll stay down here in the South that's
sw2384B-ms98-a-0036 212.502750 214.214875 it's a little bit different
sw2384B-ms98-a-0037 214.214875 217.073000 [silence]
sw2384B-ms98-a-0038 217.073000 219.104250 yeah that's true
sw2384B-ms98-a-0039 219.104250 220.701250 that's true
sw2384B-ms98-a-0040 220.701250 231.723375 well i guess the only other uh things that i like to do you know the oil changes and things that are not worth paying for at least in my neck of the woods so
sw2384B-ms98-a-0041 231.723375 234.265875 we do that kind of maintenance and
sw2384B-ms98-a-0042 234.265875 239.137500 yeah do the oil chan[ge]- oil and filter and air filters and
sw2384B-ms98-a-0043 239.137500 247.129125 spark plugs and the like can't do much in the way of actual tune up now that the car now that computers taken over that control
sw2384B-ms98-a-0044 247.129125 252.498500 um it costs about a hundred and something to get the small module that reads that and
sw2384B-ms98-a-0045 252.498500 257.740875 [silence]
sw2384B-ms98-a-0046 257.740875 259.071250 yeah
sw2384B-ms98-a-0047 259.071250 261.521000 [silence]
sw2384B-ms98-a-0048 261.521000 269.544125 well i'll tell you some of the horror stories that the the male populace have done to the women i- i recall a a uh
sw2384B-ms98-a-0049 269.544125 281.627250 coed when i was in college some of the guys got together and decided to tell this poor girl the way to change her oil was to uh they showed her where to take it out and she did that successfully and then showed her how to
sw2384B-ms98-a-0050 281.627250 290.102375 uh put it back in but on putting it back in they had her put in they had her put in all four or five quarts of this oil with an eyedropper down the dip stick
sw2384B-ms98-a-0051 290.102375 293.687875 and she did it oh and it was just
sw2384B-ms98-a-0052 293.687875 296.176875 that was mean
sw2384B-ms98-a-0053 296.176875 297.654250 yep
sw2384B-ms98-a-0054 297.654250 304.276875 so i guess it it is to your advantage to either not have friends like that or take a little course in
sw2384B-ms98-a-0055 304.276875 305.758000 yeah
sw2384B-ms98-a-0056 305.758000 310.572500 yeah those have really cropped up uh years of late but uh
sw2384B-ms98-a-0057 310.572500 313.957750 [silence]
sw2384B-ms98-a-0058 313.957750 316.009000 yeah yeah that's
sw2384B-ms98-a-0059 316.009000 317.208875 [silence]
sw2384B-ms98-a-0060 317.208875 321.715125 that's true i usually try to catch the oil at eighty cents or so and
sw2384B-ms98-a-0061 321.715125 331.767750 and uh stack up on a case of that and grab the two dollars filters [noise] when they're on sale and wait for a good weather and go out there course getting rid of the oil is getting harder these days 
sw2384B-ms98-a-0062 331.767750 334.112000 end up having to take it somewhere
sw2384B-ms98-a-0063 334.112000 336.329375 [silence]
sw2384B-ms98-a-0064 336.329375 337.452875 right
sw2384B-ms98-a-0065 337.452875 338.940250 [silence]
sw2384B-ms98-a-0066 338.940250 347.464875 well they get a little money for it i mean they they pay they sell it so they should be you know unless it's a hassle or a labor
sw2384B-ms98-a-0067 347.464875 357.550000 in you know just dealing with the customer maybe that's there only reason why they don't it'd seem like they'd just put a little barrel out there and say it pour here and go on [laughter] we'll take your money
sw2384B-ms98-a-0068 357.550000 405.550000 [silence]
sw2384B-ms98-a-0069 405.550000 406.948375 um-hum

sw2384B-ms98-a-0081 432.084500 434.130375 that's not to bad then
sw2384B-ms98-a-0082 434.130375 436.357625 [silence]
sw2384B-ms98-a-0083 436.357625 441.154000 well i hear my kids are needing me again so i'll
