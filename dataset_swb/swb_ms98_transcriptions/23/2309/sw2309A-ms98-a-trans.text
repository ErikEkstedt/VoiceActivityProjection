sw2309A-ms98-a-0015 52.695000 86.266000 [silence]
sw2309A-ms98-a-0016 86.266000 95.879875 yeah i would agree with that i think you're right i think they sometimes get carried away by the circumstances and make huge settlements thinking well it's only going to cost the insurance company and
sw2309A-ms98-a-0017 95.879875 106.580750 [silence]

sw2309A-ms98-a-0020 108.932625 116.621500 if they give them_1 all the information i don't know when it comes to sentencing phase i guess they tell them_1 if a guy if the person has a previous record and stuff
sw2309A-ms98-a-0021 116.621500 122.807125 sometimes it seems like during the trial part the jury's not you know misses some of the best evidence because they make them_1 leave and
sw2309A-ms98-a-0022 122.807125 125.636250 the judge decides whether or not they should hear it
sw2309A-ms98-a-0023 125.636250 134.016375 [silence]

sw2309A-ms98-a-0034 163.976625 167.730125 some of them_1 disagree i mean some of them_1 said one way and some the other
sw2309A-ms98-a-0035 167.730125 173.736125 [silence]
sw2309A-ms98-a-0036 173.736125 176.181250 i think it does have to be unanimous
sw2309A-ms98-a-0037 176.181250 178.987125 [silence]
sw2309A-ms98-a-0038 178.987125 184.349875 i know they can poll a jury make sure everybody agrees with what they said the verdict was but
sw2309A-ms98-a-0039 184.349875 187.981125 i thought that they all had to [laughter-agree] or else they it was a hung jury
sw2309A-ms98-a-0040 187.981125 188.737500 and
sw2309A-ms98-a-0041 188.737500 193.782625 yeah i thi[nk]- i don't know how i feel about that i think maybe uh
sw2309A-ms98-a-0042 193.782625 196.478750 majority might be sufficient
sw2309A-ms98-a-0043 196.478750 199.291875 it's hard to say though i
sw2309A-ms98-a-0044 199.291875 202.571875 [silence]
sw2309A-ms98-a-0045 202.571875 204.051625 oh

sw2309A-ms98-a-0053 232.000000 237.098625 yeah i think maybe they'd need to be more knowledgeable though than just your average Joe off the street
sw2309A-ms98-a-0054 237.098625 240.757125 for something like that because of the cultural differences
sw2309A-ms98-a-0055 240.757125 242.489500 things like that
sw2309A-ms98-a-0056 242.489500 247.506375 [silence]
sw2309A-ms98-a-0057 247.506375 250.875750 yeah what about uniform sentencing
sw2309A-ms98-a-0058 250.875750 256.013250 [silence]
sw2309A-ms98-a-0059 256.013250 262.923750 right yeah like if you're convicted of a certain crime you automatically get so many years it's not a discretionary thing

sw2309A-ms98-a-0064 278.174500 283.894625 i wish that when they sentence someone if they're going to sentence him to five years then make him serve five years
sw2309A-ms98-a-0065 283.894625 285.360750 you know

sw2309A-ms98-a-0073 313.464375 318.391500 i don't think so either In fact i think they end up worse because the conditions are so bad

sw2309A-ms98-a-0075 319.963250 321.040000 [silence]
sw2309A-ms98-a-0076 321.040000 332.233375 i think i think maybe they ought to just be punished with some some kind of real punishment like hard labor for a shorter length of time you know actually make them_1 do something that's not pleasant
sw2309A-ms98-a-0077 332.233375 342.122500 and do it and get it over with and get back in the you know world and not spend so much time sitting around letting the bad influences of the other ones rub off on them_1 and
