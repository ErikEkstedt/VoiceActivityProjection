sw2309B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 2.126750 [silence]
sw2309B-ms98-a-0002 2.126750 7.633250 never i've never been served on the jury never been called up in a jury although some of my friends have been jurors
sw2309B-ms98-a-0003 7.633250 9.296750 [silence]
sw2309B-ms98-a-0004 9.296750 14.395250 you haven't huh if you were uh what do you think about the whole concept of a trial by your peers
sw2309B-ms98-a-0005 14.395250 22.429750 [silence]
sw2309B-ms98-a-0006 22.429750 28.979875 i think the major thing they need to correct is how long it takes something to get to jury and to get to trial 
sw2309B-ms98-a-0007 28.979875 34.099625 and i don't know if that's just a pure volumes number or or what but uh
sw2309B-ms98-a-0008 34.099625 43.103875 sometimes i think the jury is ignorant in the facts of law and how things should be determined and they're too easily swayed by their emotion
sw2309B-ms98-a-0009 43.103875 46.941625 hence is possible error as you can see in all the ironsides
sw2309B-ms98-a-0010 46.941625 48.810500 TV shows
sw2309B-ms98-a-0011 48.810500 52.007625 [silence]
sw2309B-ms98-a-0012 52.007625 64.997000 no i think there are certain things that uh the jury can determine as far as uh guilty or not guilty but as far as the aff[ixing]- aff[ixing]- affixing of punishment and fines and things of that nature
sw2309B-ms98-a-0013 64.997000 77.550750 [noise] i don't know if that is best left up to the jury to de[cide]- to award you know two point two million dollar kind of settlement versus a judge knowing you know it it's true that you know this may be sad and all that thing but uh 
sw2309B-ms98-a-0014 77.550750 87.248750 the jury i think is best in most cases suited for determination of guilt and innocence but not the award of of penalties and fines and punishment
sw2309B-ms98-a-0015 87.248750 94.697250 [silence]
sw2309B-ms98-a-0016 94.697250 96.265250 um-hum
sw2309B-ms98-a-0017 96.265250 106.841375 that's true but uh i do like the idea of the jury being the the the people who decide in the matter of uh if it's a jail term versus life and death
sw2309B-ms98-a-0018 106.841375 108.982375 you know the death penalty and such
sw2309B-ms98-a-0019 108.982375 115.738125 [silence]
sw2309B-ms98-a-0020 115.738125 117.325750 uh-huh
sw2309B-ms98-a-0021 117.325750 122.630750 [silence]
sw2309B-ms98-a-0022 122.630750 123.847375 right
sw2309B-ms98-a-0023 123.847375 124.941750 [silence]
sw2309B-ms98-a-0024 124.941750 134.663500 yeah uh it it it's kind of difficult and i guess the whole system is set up to rather let uh some guilty people go free than to put an innocent person in in jail
sw2309B-ms98-a-0025 134.663500 137.528250 although you still hear about those occasionally
sw2309B-ms98-a-0026 137.528250 141.264625 [silence]
sw2309B-ms98-a-0027 141.264625 150.510125 um i don't know i you know i heard a very interesting and maybe it's just the TV show or movie i was watching they were going through a trial
sw2309B-ms98-a-0028 150.510125 156.542625 and i think it was like on one of the the documentary TV shows where they ask for the the verdict by the jury
sw2309B-ms98-a-0029 156.542625 160.652000 and they went by each one saying guilty or innocent guilty or innocent
sw2309B-ms98-a-0030 160.652000 163.375375 and they took it more as just like a majority
sw2309B-ms98-a-0031 163.375375 164.928000 so i- i
sw2309B-ms98-a-0032 164.928000 166.734250 [silence]
sw2309B-ms98-a-0033 166.734250 174.293750 exactly but they took you know whatever the majority was so i didn't know if that was just something for drama or that's truly the way it is i always thought it had to be unanimous
sw2309B-ms98-a-0034 174.293750 175.728125 [silence]
sw2309B-ms98-a-0035 175.728125 177.164000 but uh
sw2309B-ms98-a-0036 177.164000 179.136500 rather interesting
sw2309B-ms98-a-0037 179.136500 187.308750 [silence]
sw2309B-ms98-a-0038 187.308750 189.886875 uh-huh i did i did also
sw2309B-ms98-a-0039 189.886875 195.100125 [silence]
sw2309B-ms98-a-0040 195.100125 196.069875 [noise]
sw2309B-ms98-a-0041 196.069875 197.326875 uh-huh
sw2309B-ms98-a-0042 197.326875 198.265000 [silence]
sw2309B-ms98-a-0043 198.265000 200.582125 what about in international
sw2309B-ms98-a-0044 200.582125 204.425250 trials do you think they should have a jury there i think that would be kind of interesting
sw2309B-ms98-a-0045 204.425250 207.149875 [silence]
sw2309B-ms98-a-0046 207.149875 213.208375 i guess the the problem with that is there's no true authority in any kind of international verdicts
sw2309B-ms98-a-0047 213.208375 220.514625 like you know the old day with the rack we they're going to say okay you're guilty and you have to pay Kuwait four million dollars well whose going to really make them_1
sw2309B-ms98-a-0048 220.514625 221.878250 nobody
sw2309B-ms98-a-0049 221.878250 222.727750 [silence]
sw2309B-ms98-a-0050 222.727750 223.896000 so
sw2309B-ms98-a-0051 223.896000 229.964250 but i think it would be kind of interesting to incorporate that concept of you know [vocalized-noise] people from different countries
sw2309B-ms98-a-0052 229.964250 233.018500 uh in as international law also
sw2309B-ms98-a-0053 233.018500 236.460000 [silence]
sw2309B-ms98-a-0054 236.460000 237.827750 um-hum
sw2309B-ms98-a-0055 237.827750 239.945125 [silence]
sw2309B-ms98-a-0056 239.945125 241.204125 right
sw2309B-ms98-a-0057 241.204125 242.235625 [silence]
sw2309B-ms98-a-0058 242.235625 246.070625 i don't know how what it what it would take to be come up with a true perfect 
sw2309B-ms98-a-0059 246.070625 248.674125 system or if one exists but
sw2309B-ms98-a-0060 248.674125 250.499625 [silence]
sw2309B-ms98-a-0061 250.499625 257.199000 uh is that the crime and it's already [vocalized-noise] false due to some chart and determine the punishment or
sw2309B-ms98-a-0062 257.199000 262.242000 [silence]
sw2309B-ms98-a-0063 262.242000 268.065000 um-hum [noise] i think there should be a core minimum that they get but uh
sw2309B-ms98-a-0064 268.065000 278.049625 i guess there should be some flexibility because_1 every situation may be unique that the judge can either increase that or keep it just at its minimum things of that nature
sw2309B-ms98-a-0065 278.049625 279.467625 i
sw2309B-ms98-a-0066 279.467625 283.444000 [silence]
sw2309B-ms98-a-0067 283.444000 290.378125 yeah that serves a kind of if they're i guess uh if you sentence someone to life life is only forty nine years something like that
sw2309B-ms98-a-0068 290.378125 295.833500 and i guess you're eligible after twenty seven for parole even though you're in for life
sw2309B-ms98-a-0069 295.833500 299.779125 [silence]
sw2309B-ms98-a-0070 299.779125 307.491250 yeah although i guess it's your you want them_1 to rehabilitate and become better rather than sitting in there and being a drain all the time
sw2309B-ms98-a-0071 307.491250 308.913625 [silence]
sw2309B-ms98-a-0072 308.913625 314.740375 no because uh inside the jail there i don't think there's no real rehabilitation it just
sw2309B-ms98-a-0073 314.740375 317.424750 [silence]
sw2309B-ms98-a-0074 317.424750 319.457000 yes it's another war zone
sw2309B-ms98-a-0075 319.457000 320.749500 but
sw2309B-ms98-a-0076 320.749500 322.100500 who knows
sw2309B-ms98-a-0077 322.100500 328.685375 [silence]
sw2309B-ms98-a-0078 328.685375 331.118500 i agree get them_1 out there
sw2309B-ms98-a-0079 331.118500 340.456625 [silence]
sw2309B-ms98-a-0080 340.456625 353.294250 sure they should have them_1 go out and doing stuff cleaning up or picking up dirt or weeds or who knows what something for the for the state since the state is paying for them_1 they should get some kind of kind of work out of them
sw2309B-ms98-a-0081 353.294250 355.797500 [silence]
sw2309B-ms98-a-0082 355.797500 357.256750 exactly
sw2309B-ms98-a-0083 357.256750 359.610375 trading their lives for cigarettes
sw2309B-ms98-a-0084 359.610375 361.482250 those kinds of things
sw2309B-ms98-a-0085 361.482250 363.004375 well good
sw2309B-ms98-a-0086 363.004375 364.007625 [silence]
sw2309B-ms98-a-0087 364.007625 365.671000 i think so
sw2309B-ms98-a-0088 365.671000 367.053250 nice talking to you also
sw2309B-ms98-a-0089 367.053250 368.259500 have a wonderful Easter
