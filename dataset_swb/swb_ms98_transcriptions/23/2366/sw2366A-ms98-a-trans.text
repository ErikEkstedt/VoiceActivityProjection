sw2366A-ms98-a-0002 58.818375 66.857750 when you say that you grew up uh in the sixties i take it that was the uh teenage type years or uh
sw2366A-ms98-a-0003 66.857750 69.909750 [silence]
sw2366A-ms98-a-0004 69.909750 70.963125 okay
sw2366A-ms98-a-0005 70.963125 79.745375 we we're very similarly aged so we probably have an in[teresting]- an interesting perspective on the music on the times so i'm just a couple years older than you uh
sw2366A-ms98-a-0006 79.745375 93.678375 essentially i was one of the nerdy types in high school really which meant that i for one reason or another i didn't pay much attention to music but as i look back now i realize it was very formative for me
sw2366A-ms98-a-0007 93.678375 95.061625 uh
sw2366A-ms98-a-0008 95.061625 107.603375 my early popular music interests were in Simon and Garfunkel whom i saw perform when i was in college and i became attached to that style of uh
sw2366A-ms98-a-0009 107.603375 111.157375 urban urban country if there is such a thing i think with
sw2366A-ms98-a-0010 111.157375 123.613375 uh in a way one could talk about Simon and Garfunkel that way because they do tend uh to have a dramatic or story approach to their music uh usually tend to have some sort of good or bad moral to it
sw2366A-ms98-a-0011 123.613375 124.887250 uh
sw2366A-ms98-a-0012 124.887250 132.013125 over time i became very interested in in baroque classical and i think that was just through
sw2366A-ms98-a-0013 132.013125 143.339250 experiencing contacting college and the fact that i found it it very relaxing for me my tastes now run i guess to a upbeat
sw2366A-ms98-a-0014 143.339250 145.821125 uh Simon
sw2366A-ms98-a-0015 145.821125 158.322375 it's something that interests me uh combined with with the classical tastes i had mentioned and my classical music tends to be confined to the seventeen hundreds early eighteen hundred
sw2366A-ms98-a-0016 158.322375 168.449875 music i'm not a not a music um [vocalized-noise] i'm not particularly schooled in it i know what i like to listen to as far as classical music
sw2366A-ms98-a-0017 168.449875 169.559375 and i
sw2366A-ms98-a-0018 169.559375 173.123000 i spent a good deal of time listening also to uh
sw2366A-ms98-a-0019 173.123000 174.322625 [silence]
sw2366A-ms98-a-0020 174.322625 180.525625 people from the late seventies really um Neil Diamond for instance
sw2366A-ms98-a-0021 180.525625 182.183625 Um
sw2366A-ms98-a-0022 182.183625 185.053375 people of of that particular time i
sw2366A-ms98-a-0023 185.053375 187.807625 listen to some country and western but i'm not sch[ool]-
sw2366A-ms98-a-0024 187.807625 197.858250 schooled in it and i i've enjoyed the times when i have listened to it i played a little bit of piano i've i continue to think that i want to do it and i never have the discipline to stay with it
sw2366A-ms98-a-0025 197.858250 199.565500 but when i do play
sw2366A-ms98-a-0026 199.565500 209.850500 uh and and begin to reacquire skills i inevitably fall in love with country western music which tends to be in some ways easy to play for a for a new piano player
sw2366A-ms98-a-0027 209.850500 215.245000 [silence]
sw2366A-ms98-a-0028 215.245000 216.784250 right
sw2366A-ms98-a-0029 216.784250 296.607375 [silence]
sw2366A-ms98-a-0030 296.607375 298.099875 right
sw2366A-ms98-a-0031 298.099875 310.529625 [silence]
sw2366A-ms98-a-0032 310.529625 318.140125 i find it very interesting that some television shows that i enjoy i particularly like the music i don't know which is chicken and egg in that situation
sw2366A-ms98-a-0033 318.140125 328.001375 uh a good example would be uh i have connections but but uh not particularly deep ones to the Vietnamese war type situations
sw2366A-ms98-a-0034 328.001375 328.930750 uh
sw2366A-ms98-a-0035 328.930750 338.365375 and i found that i really like China Beach and i particularly like Tour of Duty and both of them i had as much fascination of the background music i think going on as i did to the theme of the shows
sw2366A-ms98-a-0036 338.365375 344.784750 uh and and i've uh Thirty Something i'm particularly interested but it's the music almost that i find myself listening to
sw2366A-ms98-a-0037 344.784750 358.671250 [silence]
sw2366A-ms98-a-0038 358.671250 361.682250 that could well be i i uh
sw2366A-ms98-a-0039 361.682250 364.605875 spent my junior year uh
sw2366A-ms98-a-0040 364.605875 369.305000 and sophomore and junior year in in college when i a song by the uh
sw2366A-ms98-a-0041 369.305000 370.691875 [silence]
sw2366A-ms98-a-0042 370.691875 373.299875 uh i think the title of it was just Downtown
sw2366A-ms98-a-0043 373.299875 376.386750 uh and if you recall how it goes downtown {da} {dah} {dah} {dah}
sw2366A-ms98-a-0044 376.386750 379.400250 uh all i have to do is hear that song
sw2366A-ms98-a-0045 379.400250 386.917500 and i get you strongly evoked memories of of difficult times in school being behind on work
sw2366A-ms98-a-0046 386.917500 388.140250 uh and
sw2366A-ms98-a-0047 388.140250 391.665125 my family now knows if they come into my study and uh
sw2366A-ms98-a-0048 391.665125 396.663500 i happen to have had a tough day at work and maybe i'm trying to get a project done uh at school
sw2366A-ms98-a-0049 396.663500 397.861625 uh
sw2366A-ms98-a-0050 397.861625 404.126500 and i'm humming or whistling in a sort of mad crazy way the tune to Downtown they know to just stay away
sw2366A-ms98-a-0051 404.126500 404.765125 [laughter]
sw2366A-ms98-a-0052 404.765125 405.698000 [silence]
sw2366A-ms98-a-0053 405.698000 408.810000 they can hear the unconscious music signal behind it that's right
sw2366A-ms98-a-0054 408.810000 413.107875 [silence]
sw2366A-ms98-a-0055 413.107875 415.570750 uh probably about first grade
sw2366A-ms98-a-0056 415.570750 421.054750 and i have uh returned about every four or five years to thinking that i would like to to do something about it
sw2366A-ms98-a-0057 421.054750 428.006250 i usually get to the point where i can play some of my favorite themes and then inevitably i am swept away by the
sw2366A-ms98-a-0058 428.006250 430.766500 the pressure of other types of things uh
sw2366A-ms98-a-0059 430.766500 432.030500 [silence]
sw2366A-ms98-a-0060 432.030500 435.126125 it is in order to continue to to grow and i
sw2366A-ms98-a-0061 435.126125 445.741250 i always think that i'll be able to do it and then i inevitably discover that i have no innate [laughter] music talent relative to composition and that i struggle and really can't quite understand what it is that other people take for granted 
sw2366A-ms98-a-0062 445.741250 456.755500 in composition themes and i [vocalized-noise] keys and things are something to me that remain a mystery no matter how many times i bang on them i have a pretty good mathematical concept for what's involved
sw2366A-ms98-a-0063 456.755500 471.393125 uh but in a in a innate music sense there just seems to be something missing there which is always frustrating for me since i have pretty high math aptitude and i keep thinking gee i thought that all the math and music people are supposed to go hand in hand but it doesn't for me
sw2366A-ms98-a-0064 471.393125 489.110500 [silence]
sw2366A-ms98-a-0065 489.110500 490.595000 [laughter]

sw2366A-ms98-a-0067 496.827375 497.899500 uh-huh
sw2366A-ms98-a-0068 497.899500 512.945625 [silence]
sw2366A-ms98-a-0069 512.945625 514.113000 oh [vocalized-noise]
sw2366A-ms98-a-0070 514.113000 520.200625 [silence]
sw2366A-ms98-a-0071 520.200625 526.700000 so we both have a secret background that says somehow or another we just knew we were piano players and never got a chance uh
sw2366A-ms98-a-0072 526.700000 527.947250 [silence]
sw2366A-ms98-a-0073 527.947250 530.901125 that's the most fascinating thing [laughter]
sw2366A-ms98-a-0074 530.901125 533.459750 and you sir you take care
sw2366A-ms98-a-0075 533.459750 534.794125 okay bye-bye
