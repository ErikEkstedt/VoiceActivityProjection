sw2366B-ms98-a-0002 1.105750 7.505375 i don't know i grew up uh in the the sixties and at that time
sw2366B-ms98-a-0003 7.505375 19.407500 uh it was uh a changing time for the whole music scene i guess and i grew up with the Beatles and the Rolling Stones and the whole pot culture during that time and went through that phase and
sw2366B-ms98-a-0004 19.407500 26.400500 kind of stayed with it i guess for several years after i graduated from college and and thereafter but have since
sw2366B-ms98-a-0005 26.400500 36.084875 uh since i grew up in a small town in in southern Oklahoma i have kind of gone back to uh more of a county uh flavor in music um
sw2366B-ms98-a-0006 36.084875 45.621125 i'm not quite sure why that is and it seems like almost a an opposite but i guess i got away from what i consider to be the pop
sw2366B-ms98-a-0007 45.621125 58.504000 uh sounding music it didn't have what you know i guess what i was looking for at the time country tells more of a a story it kind of reminds me of my roots of growing up and i've i've become i guess more of a country fan over the years
sw2366B-ms98-a-0008 58.504000 66.764750 [silence]
sw2366B-ms98-a-0009 66.764750 69.933250 yeah that was my teenage years i was born in fifty and and uh
sw2366B-ms98-a-0010 69.933250 109.868500 [silence]
sw2366B-ms98-a-0011 109.868500 111.240875 yeah
sw2366B-ms98-a-0012 111.240875 145.630875 [silence]
sw2366B-ms98-a-0013 145.630875 146.676125 yeah
sw2366B-ms98-a-0014 146.676125 168.000000 [silence]
sw2366B-ms98-a-0015 168.000000 170.050000 that's kind of the way i am
sw2366B-ms98-a-0016 170.050000 209.201625 [silence]
sw2366B-ms98-a-0017 209.201625 215.746750 it is it's got uh basically an easy uh rhythm and and tone
sw2366B-ms98-a-0018 215.746750 225.433375 and it's it's pretty fairly well easily to uh uh something to fall into i'm kind of the say way i i've gone through different periods of life uh in music
sw2366B-ms98-a-0019 225.433375 239.187875 from from pop to classical i guess one of the things was that influenced me was that i i've worked in radio stations as a DJ for all my college years trying to support my way through there and supp[ort]- was support was uh
sw2366B-ms98-a-0020 239.187875 249.269875 influenced by all different kinds of music but basically because that's where i worked and i've developed a real love for uh classical music in
sw2366B-ms98-a-0021 249.269875 262.748625 probably junior high and high school because my band instructor was uh heavy into classical type music he said he used to sit on Saturday mornings and watch cartoons just to hear the music
sw2366B-ms98-a-0022 262.748625 267.063750 uh that they were using behind them because they used especially Disney used a lot of classical music
sw2366B-ms98-a-0023 267.063750 280.968000 behind the cartoons and so consequently we wind up wound up playing a lot of classical music there and i think that uh got deep seated into me one of things i especially like now in music regardless of what kind it is 
sw2366B-ms98-a-0024 280.968000 286.969125 uh are those that call on those classical uh
sw2366B-ms98-a-0025 286.969125 297.462750 roots i guess uh Barry Manilow comes to mind for some reason there's there's not a whole [laughter-lot] of his stuff that i'm real crazy about but he does have some things Chicago had some things
sw2366B-ms98-a-0026 297.462750 300.597500 uh and i think even Electric Light Orchestra had some
sw2366B-ms98-a-0027 300.597500 302.813875 some real um
sw2366B-ms98-a-0028 302.813875 305.537875 influences by classical music and
sw2366B-ms98-a-0029 305.537875 310.440875 i'm still still my favorite in fact most of my CDs that i got are classical music
sw2366B-ms98-a-0030 310.440875 336.868750 [silence]
sw2366B-ms98-a-0031 336.868750 338.138125 yeah

sw2366B-ms98-a-0035 345.200000 348.750500 i'm kind of thinking that that's maybe our generation was
sw2366B-ms98-a-0036 348.750500 352.037625 uh so in tuned to music
sw2366B-ms98-a-0037 352.037625 355.024500 of that time that we identify
sw2366B-ms98-a-0038 355.024500 358.920125 goodness or badness with uh things now with the music that's behinds them
sw2366B-ms98-a-0039 358.920125 373.349500 [silence]

sw2366B-ms98-a-0058 471.417500 475.257750 no it's making that uh that connection especially with the mechanical
sw2366B-ms98-a-0059 475.257750 486.148750 parts of it i was never able to to master all that in fact my brother and sister both they were oh thirteen sixteen years older than i they went through the uh
sw2366B-ms98-a-0060 486.148750 490.533750 parent thing where you've got to practice or you're not going out to play thing
sw2366B-ms98-a-0061 490.533750 501.409625 and when it came to my turn the folks said no we're not going through that again they sold the piano and is the turns out i was the only one who really had an interest in it and never got to so i that's one of things i felt like i missed in life and i i really in fact uh
sw2366B-ms98-a-0062 501.409625 507.447750 one of my favorite things to do now is sit down and listen to Chopin that is played on uh piano i just
sw2366B-ms98-a-0063 507.447750 513.281000 you know i can just drift off into some other world just listening to that for hours if i ever have the time to do that
sw2366B-ms98-a-0064 513.281000 520.255500 maybe one of these days i'll you know i'm kind of like you maybe one of these days i'll get around to it i'll do something with the piano but probably not
sw2366B-ms98-a-0065 520.255500 526.527125 [silence]
sw2366B-ms98-a-0066 526.527125 528.625625 just never got a chance to come out no
