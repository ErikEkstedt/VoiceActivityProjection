sw2377A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.072875 [noise]
sw2377A-ms98-a-0002 1.072875 7.243625 well i'm uh an engineer so i'm heartedly in favor of this country converting to metric
sw2377A-ms98-a-0003 7.243625 37.232375 [silence]
sw2377A-ms98-a-0004 37.232375 38.655250 uh-huh
sw2377A-ms98-a-0005 38.655250 55.904750 [silence]
sw2377A-ms98-a-0006 55.904750 64.630000 Yeah well i think uh you know from an elementary standpoint it would help to get rid of some of the the oddball conversion units like
sw2377A-ms98-a-0007 64.630000 66.640000 twelve inches to the foot and
sw2377A-ms98-a-0008 66.640000 74.680875 thirty six [laughter-inches] to the yard and things like that but uh i think uh from my work experience i found
sw2377A-ms98-a-0009 74.680875 76.805125 well wh[en]- in college
sw2377A-ms98-a-0010 76.805125 83.580000 i learned uh to use a rationalized system of measure which turned out to be the metric system
sw2377A-ms98-a-0011 83.580000 91.991000 and an awful lot of the problems that we did on exams and our homework assignments and everything else involved [vocalized-noise] converting
sw2377A-ms98-a-0012 91.991000 99.774250 from uh English units or nonstandard units into this uh rationalized M K F system
sw2377A-ms98-a-0013 99.774250 109.314375 and uh so i became quite accustomed to uh to a rationalized system and and used to making all the necessary conversions
sw2377A-ms98-a-0014 109.314375 116.868750 and since then i have discovered uh other engineers are very prone to make mistakes
sw2377A-ms98-a-0015 116.868750 124.322750 because they will pick up a textbook and uh and find some formula for solving a problem
sw2377A-ms98-a-0016 124.322750 139.318875 and they fail to realize that the formula is expressed in the the rationalized M K F system and they'll proceed to plug in inches and feet and pounds and uh [laughter] things like that and they come up with a funniest answers you ever you can imagine
sw2377A-ms98-a-0017 139.318875 151.503000 and some of them don't realize that they've made a mistake and so uh you know a lot of energy and uh a lot of work and so forth uh goes into building something only to discover it doesn't work [laughter]
sw2377A-ms98-a-0018 151.503000 159.931750 [silence]
sw2377A-ms98-a-0019 159.931750 161.252625 Yeah
sw2377A-ms98-a-0020 161.252625 185.377625 [silence]
sw2377A-ms98-a-0021 185.377625 186.479000 Yeah
sw2377A-ms98-a-0022 186.479000 194.027375 [silence]
sw2377A-ms98-a-0023 194.027375 205.822500 [vocalized-noise] i kind of agree that uh maybe ten on or twenty years ago we should have gone into a uh sort of a dual display arrangement where you know our our speed limit signs were
sw2377A-ms98-a-0024 205.822500 213.922875 were sort of a double sign with a a big miles per hour and a little kilometers per hour type uh marking on the side
sw2377A-ms98-a-0025 213.922875 221.125000 and then over the years the the kilometers per hour gets bigger than the [laughter-miles] [laughter-per] [laughter-hour] and eventually disappears
sw2377A-ms98-a-0026 221.125000 226.629875 uh and little things like that i i notice in a lot of uh
sw2377A-ms98-a-0027 226.629875 238.283250 uh technical literature that you pick up and catalogs and so forth that you will find the metric units expressed in parenthesis or sometimes the other way around the metric units are expressed first
sw2377A-ms98-a-0028 238.283250 243.029375 and then the English equivalent that's uh is put into parenthesis for reference
sw2377A-ms98-a-0029 243.029375 260.955875 [silence]
sw2377A-ms98-a-0030 260.955875 262.377250 yeah
sw2377A-ms98-a-0031 262.377250 281.502125 [silence]
sw2377A-ms98-a-0032 281.502125 293.469875 you know i think also equally important is that uh it needs to be put into practice in in everyday life we're seeing a little bit of it now that you go out to work on your car and you discover your English wrenches don't fit
sw2377A-ms98-a-0033 293.469875 297.720000 [laughter] you've got to go out and buy a metric set
sw2377A-ms98-a-0034 297.720000 311.758750 [silence]
sw2377A-ms98-a-0035 311.758750 312.827500 uh-huh
sw2377A-ms98-a-0036 312.827500 314.708250 [silence]
sw2377A-ms98-a-0037 314.708250 325.780375 i was a little disappointed that uh United States is lagging the rest of the world but all of the other countries in the world have made the change and even the British which are probably the most stodgy
sw2377A-ms98-a-0038 325.780375 333.092750 population and the originator of our English system of measure uh they have gone metric
sw2377A-ms98-a-0039 333.092750 334.148375 yeah
sw2377A-ms98-a-0040 334.148375 338.469375 [silence]
sw2377A-ms98-a-0041 338.469375 339.375500 right
sw2377A-ms98-a-0042 339.375500 351.989125 [silence]
sw2377A-ms98-a-0043 351.989125 353.323125 uh-huh
sw2377A-ms98-a-0044 353.323125 374.946750 [silence]
sw2377A-ms98-a-0045 374.946750 376.095250 yeah
sw2377A-ms98-a-0046 376.095250 380.006750 [silence]
sw2377A-ms98-a-0047 380.006750 381.161625 I
sw2377A-ms98-a-0048 381.161625 391.823500 i think one of the other concepts that uh comes along with using a rationalized system of measure is uh a technique of keeping track of units
sw2377A-ms98-a-0049 391.823500 406.679000 when you're solving a problem that if you're sitting there trying to uh establish a relationship with some physical system uh when you come up with your final formula if you analyze the units of measure they should come out right
sw2377A-ms98-a-0050 406.679000 415.044500 and the the basic units of measure are are distance and time and mass and electric charge
sw2377A-ms98-a-0051 415.044500 425.239875 and so if you convert all your measure into those uh fundamental units and analyze them you can uh get a pretty good sense as to whether your formula is correct
sw2377A-ms98-a-0052 425.239875 430.496125 maybe you left out a factor of pi or something like [laughter-that] [laughter-but]
sw2377A-ms98-a-0053 430.496125 454.286250 [silence]
sw2377A-ms98-a-0054 454.286250 455.862125 Well i
sw2377A-ms98-a-0055 455.862125 457.810125 [silence]
sw2377A-ms98-a-0056 457.810125 471.075125 most of them have uh the option the American American made cars have uh uh the miles per hour as the big scale and they're little tick marks uh sort of hidden on the scale which shows kilometers per hour
sw2377A-ms98-a-0057 471.075125 476.850125 But those that are manufactured for sale in in Europe and so forth are quite the other way around
sw2377A-ms98-a-0058 476.850125 490.902000 and in a lot of the Japanese cars that come to this country particularly those that have the uh electronic panels there's a little push button some place on the panel that you can switch between uh kilometers per hour and miles per hour
sw2377A-ms98-a-0059 490.902000 497.430125 my wife's uh Chrysler convertible has little buttons that you can choose what display you want to see
sw2377A-ms98-a-0060 497.430125 498.892000 [silence]
sw2377A-ms98-a-0061 498.892000 506.067250 Yeah i noticed my van has a uh a button on the temperature gauge that you can switch between centigrade and fahrenheit
sw2377A-ms98-a-0062 506.067250 521.950000 [silence]
sw2377A-ms98-a-0063 521.950000 523.032750 yeah
sw2377A-ms98-a-0064 523.032750 529.166750 [silence]
sw2377A-ms98-a-0065 529.166750 533.778500 well we also need to be a little bit careful and maybe we start
sw2377A-ms98-a-0066 533.778500 548.197875 to not use the English measure anymore like when you listen to the weather forecast the the weather man may give the temperature in centigrade and fahrenheit and everybody ignores the centigrade and listens to the fahrenheit to the fahrenheit
sw2377A-ms98-a-0067 548.197875 557.330000 and we we sort of have to get accustomed to the fact that our body temperature is thirty seven degrees centigrade [laughter] yes
sw2377A-ms98-a-0068 557.330000 563.656625 and that it's a nice day when it's twenty five degrees outside [laughter]
sw2377A-ms98-a-0069 563.656625 570.689375 [silence]
sw2377A-ms98-a-0070 570.689375 575.868625 yeah the Europeans think that you're baby is boiling over [laughter]
sw2377A-ms98-a-0071 575.868625 578.189250 [laughter]
sw2377A-ms98-a-0072 578.189250 588.380375 [silence]
sw2377A-ms98-a-0073 588.380375 589.522875 Yeah
sw2377A-ms98-a-0074 589.522875 593.833750 [silence]
sw2377A-ms98-a-0075 593.833750 599.043625 no i hope we get to the point where maybe a couple of generations from now when somebody reads the old adage
