sw2377B-ms98-a-0002 6.072500 14.027375 i bet you are i bet you are i don't know you know when i was in uh when i was in high school several years ago you know we did probably
sw2377B-ms98-a-0003 14.027375 26.535875 two or two or three weeks on the subject you know and tried to teach you the whole thing in two or three weeks and of course when you're that age you really don't care anyway and i didn't get into it very much but then i took a a list of basic math class a couple of semesters ago
sw2377B-ms98-a-0004 26.535875 37.736875 and we uh we were pretty heavily into the metric system and and before we started i just thought oh no i don't want to do this you know this is just going to be so hard and once i really realized how easy it was
sw2377B-ms98-a-0005 37.736875 47.374625 uh it was wonderful i mean it was just incredible how much simpler it is than what you know i guess we just all have this mind set that oh this is so hard and we can't do this
sw2377B-ms98-a-0006 47.374625 52.960750 and it's really not hard i was surprised at how very easy it was i think most people just uh
sw2377B-ms98-a-0007 52.960750 57.749750 you know automatically have their minds set against it and don't give it a chance you know so

sw2377B-ms98-a-0032 149.004750 160.177500 right right well you know i think that the that the only way that we are ever going to get this country switched over to metrics is just to start other with with the kids right now
sw2377B-ms98-a-0033 160.177500 172.346625 you know you you you're going to have to start with the kids who are in sch[ool]- that are in when school and you're going to have to teach it well not like when i was in school and do two weeks on it in a math class and that's all you ever hear about it you know they're going to have to start
sw2377B-ms98-a-0034 172.346625 185.816125 with the little ones and teach it right now and then when you know those little ones are our age you know that's what they're going to know and that's what they're going to use there's no way you're going to get you know most of the United States adult population to automatically relearn and switch
sw2377B-ms98-a-0035 185.816125 194.267000 you know it's just not going to happen that way but i do think if they would start with the kids now at you know in you know twenty years from now we could be switched over
sw2377B-ms98-a-0036 194.267000 195.174000 you know

sw2377B-ms98-a-0044 218.535875 219.823125 they'll
sw2377B-ms98-a-0045 219.823125 222.569250 very good idea yeah yeah
sw2377B-ms98-a-0046 222.569250 239.385250 [silence]
sw2377B-ms98-a-0047 239.385250 241.095875 uh-huh

sw2377B-ms98-a-0049 242.479500 254.191875 yeah i think i think it's going to take that but i you know i- [vocalized-noise] i think it's going to take a lot more than that too you know it's going to take it's going to take this education with o[ur]- with our kids i really believe that but you know
sw2377B-ms98-a-0050 254.191875 261.405875 [vocalized-noise] we we knew that we weren't going to have to ever use it again we knew we were going to have two or three weeks of it in math class so why take the time to really learn it
sw2377B-ms98-a-0051 261.405875 269.214500 you know i mean you would just you know learn enough to get by on the test and then you forgot about it because you knew you were never going to see it again in the rest of your years of school 
sw2377B-ms98-a-0052 269.214500 282.431875 you know and and that that's not the way to convert over you're gonna have to have these kids you know teaching it dually even you know teaching both systems which is a lot i know a lot more for the teachers to have to teach but that's the only way they're going to get switched over you know
sw2377B-ms98-a-0053 282.431875 286.803750 [silence]
sw2377B-ms98-a-0054 286.803750 288.635000 oh yes yeah

sw2377B-ms98-a-0056 292.963375 296.532125 yeah yeah that's true too that's true
sw2377B-ms98-a-0057 296.532125 298.740125 buy a whole knew metric set yeah
sw2377B-ms98-a-0058 298.740125 302.688750 well i think you know it's something that's going to take quite some time to happen
sw2377B-ms98-a-0059 302.688750 314.068750 but i i still don't think that they're doing all that it's going to take to make it happen you know it's going to happen slowly no matter what but there's going to have to be a lot more education involved than there is right now to get it to to get it to switch over
sw2377B-ms98-a-0060 314.068750 318.255875 [silence]
sw2377B-ms98-a-0061 318.255875 320.085250 oh yeah

sw2377B-ms98-a-0067 332.089500 340.568875 even they have switched yeah so yeah we're not uh we're not necessarily on the cutting edge in everything are we [laughter] just like we think we are
sw2377B-ms98-a-0068 340.568875 354.194375 so well i think eventually it will happen you know it's just going to take it's just going to take a lot of education and a lot of time and like i said i was just totally amazed at how at how very easy it was you know i i just couldn't
sw2377B-ms98-a-0069 354.194375 367.877625 you know i just when i going into it i just had this block and i went there's just no way i'm going to be able to learn this and when i sat down and really said okay just you know forget your old prejudices and really look at it you know and once you look at it's so really simple you know you
sw2377B-ms98-a-0070 367.877625 381.887875 there's really nothing to memorize there's nothing to learn it just all works the same you know you just you know transform that little you know dot from one place one one way to the other you know and that's about all you have to do so anyway i think it will happen eventually

sw2377B-ms98-a-0083 438.746500 453.120750 i don't know i wouldn't know what else to suggest to them just education start with these little kids you know and like you said you know start making it practice you know start showing all the street signs and all the ca[rs]- of course i think all the cars are manufactured that way they aren't aren't all of them
sw2377B-ms98-a-0084 453.120750 458.090000 most of the new ones i'm seeing are are made with miles per hour and kilometers on them

sw2377B-ms98-a-0098 505.005375 518.758500 oh well that's interesting too i had never seen that yeah no you know you look at most of the you know like the bank clocks and stuff like that it tells you you know fahrenheit and centigrade and it's going take those kinds of things you know switching you know [vocalized-noise]
sw2377B-ms98-a-0099 518.758500 530.245875 getting us all accustomed to seeing both you know but most people don't pay any attention you know it's going to take some education right along with it most people don't know what that means you know so
sw2377B-ms98-a-0100 530.245875 546.255125 [silence]
sw2377B-ms98-a-0101 546.255125 549.191750 that's right because that's what they're familiar with

sw2377B-ms98-a-0103 553.469625 559.542375 right that's going to be hard to do it's going to be very hard to do you know you

sw2377B-ms98-a-0108 573.193125 583.527000 that's right that's right your baby's still alive with hundred and three [laughter] so you know it it's going to take a changing lot of our old prejudices and you know just 
sw2377B-ms98-a-0109 583.527000 593.711625 making up our minds that yes we are going to do this and we're just going to forgot this old way and we're just going to do it you know and i don't think the older generation is probably ready to do that you know
