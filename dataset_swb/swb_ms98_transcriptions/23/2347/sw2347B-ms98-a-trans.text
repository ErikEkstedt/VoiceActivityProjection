sw2347B-ms98-a-0005 17.375125 24.833875 oh well i tend i tend to agree uh in some ways i think it's uh i think if anything a lot of um [noise]
sw2347B-ms98-a-0006 24.833875 38.971375 the changes that have occurred um in some ways they're for the better because i think women should have a choice and i do believe in the being able to have a choice as to as far as what you would like to do with your life but by the same token
sw2347B-ms98-a-0007 38.971375 42.843125 and i know this for myself because i've worked and i've not [laughter] worked
sw2347B-ms98-a-0008 42.843125 56.029000 um that it makes it uh sometimes it makes life more difficult i think when the roles now are less defined as far as you know what uh women should or should not be doing that
sw2347B-ms98-a-0009 56.029000 64.999000 it it m[akes]- it can make life more difficult there are more things to work out i know when i was working you know you have all these problems with
sw2347B-ms98-a-0010 64.999000 75.171250 with the child care and and with uh pleasing you know your boss on the job so you have added stresses from there and then you still have all the things that um
sw2347B-ms98-a-0011 75.171250 89.803375 that you need to do at home and and that doesn't change you know just because your your going out of the house for so many hours a day doesn't uh make those other things go away and the other responsibilities are still important um 
sw2347B-ms98-a-0012 89.803375 102.427500 so um have you have you worked outside also and um feel that it that well how do you feel as far as uh what would be a happy medium or or what would you like to see

sw2347B-ms98-a-0038 188.741500 194.383000 well what do you think though um um i don't know i the the
sw2347B-ms98-a-0039 194.383000 205.480625 one problem i guess i have and maybe why so many women younger women now are choosing to go outside is i feel that in general in this society
sw2347B-ms98-a-0040 205.480625 218.216500 that being at home is not looked upon as um a job in itself whereas you know you hear a lot of women that are home saying that it is a job in itself but i know when i was working
sw2347B-ms98-a-0041 218.216500 222.288250 and i was a an engineer so i was always with men
sw2347B-ms98-a-0042 222.288250 233.840375 uh and they were single many of them and i tried to explain to them well my day doesn't end when i leave at i used to leave at three i keep going to eleven at night and they had
sw2347B-ms98-a-0043 233.840375 247.673625 they used to look down on women that were home they'd say oh i bet you go home and you know at least you get out of here at three and you can go home and put your feet up and watch soap operas and i used to be infuriated because they really had no idea
sw2347B-ms98-a-0044 247.673625 255.421250 [noise] what was involved once i got home now taking care of them running them everywhere helping with homework the bath the whole you know everything
sw2347B-ms98-a-0045 255.421250 269.450375 um and i think that one reason that so many younger women feel in uh compelled to go into a profession is that they feel that if they stay home they are not respected
sw2347B-ms98-a-0046 269.450375 284.360375 and that being home is not a respectable uh position in society and there's a lot of truth to that and i don't know how you feel i don't know how you felt when you were home and what kind of feedback you got but i can see with the younger men
sw2347B-ms98-a-0047 284.360375 297.723625 that they definitely are looking down upon women that are home and yet by the same token i think some of it is jealousy you you once in a while you hear them say things like
sw2347B-ms98-a-0048 297.723625 306.279875 i wish i had the choice you know i wish i was the one i would stay home with my kids if my wife would go out and [laughter-support] [laughter-us]

sw2347B-ms98-a-0098 463.309750 468.224750 [silence]
sw2347B-ms98-a-0099 468.224750 479.759750 well that that's true there is that part too and i guess we also have to examine though and although your husband's probably been as much conditioned as you know [laughter] anybody else um i guess ha[ving]-
sw2347B-ms98-a-0100 479.759750 490.158750 oh oh yeah and and you have to i guess you have to question too why a lot of the men especially i think middle age and older men why they feel that way and
sw2347B-ms98-a-0101 490.158750 503.742000 and i think it gets scary for them to see change also they've been used to being really to be honest in in society and in a way number one and they come home and everything's done for them and their meal is served
sw2347B-ms98-a-0102 503.742000 513.109000 and i think it's frightening to them to see the roles switching and i think i think this reaction comes more out of fear now my husband is
sw2347B-ms98-a-0103 513.109000 518.755375 um he's ten years older than me and but he has his attitudes are
sw2347B-ms98-a-0104 518.755375 529.148500 very much pro-women pro-career which is kind of interesting he comes from a culture where women are stay at home and do everything um and yet [noise]
sw2347B-ms98-a-0105 529.148500 535.484375 um he's the type that he is willing to have to take on more responsibility
sw2347B-ms98-a-0106 535.484375 546.829875 um if that meant you know for me to be able to uh uh advance or go back to work or whatever i'm kind of more <b_aside> thank you <e_aside> i'm kind of more middle
sw2347B-ms98-a-0107 546.829875 555.173000 of the road i think that when children are small i think it's okay for women to work especially there should be some a lot more part time
sw2347B-ms98-a-0108 555.173000 557.705375 but i think it's um [noise]
sw2347B-ms98-a-0109 557.705375 566.761625 i don't believe in this career you know this career drive when when they're small because i think <b_aside> they're downstairs Aaron <e_aside> i think that's very um
sw2347B-ms98-a-0110 566.761625 577.676875 unfair to to children like uh engineers usually work fifty or sixty hours a week i refused to work more than thirty i was part-time and even that was a rat race but
sw2347B-ms98-a-0111 577.676875 588.985125 i think you have to put in perspective that you know when the kids came home from school i wanted to be here i didn't want i don't want a job where i'm traveling around and an[d]- i'm away and uh
sw2347B-ms98-a-0112 588.985125 596.542875 so i think you can have both it's more hectic but i think you have to put into perspective what your kids need first then
