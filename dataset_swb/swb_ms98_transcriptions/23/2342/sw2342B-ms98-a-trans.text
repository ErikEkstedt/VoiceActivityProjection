sw2342B-ms98-a-0002 0.564375 3.783750 so uh what do you think about our involvement in the Middle East
sw2342B-ms98-a-0003 3.783750 27.995250 [silence]
sw2342B-ms98-a-0004 27.995250 29.500750 yeah [laughter]
sw2342B-ms98-a-0005 29.500750 35.393750 well yeah that's probably true i i suspect that if any world war is come at this point in time they're going to come from there
sw2342B-ms98-a-0006 35.393750 41.929625 uh i would think anyway i mean it just seems to me that that's that's the most unstable part of the world as far as i can tell
sw2342B-ms98-a-0007 41.929625 61.539750 [silence]
sw2342B-ms98-a-0008 61.539750 62.578250 really
sw2342B-ms98-a-0009 62.578250 63.701500 [silence]
sw2342B-ms98-a-0010 63.701500 72.827750 that'd be interesting because_1 i um i actually um um i'm i'm i'm Jewish and i'm actually sort of not n[ot]- not not not really a Zionist per se you know i'm not 
sw2342B-ms98-a-0011 72.827750 74.636250 but i have a um
sw2342B-ms98-a-0012 74.636250 81.974625 i have a lot of friends you know who are sort of adamant you know Israel should it's his right and they do whatever they want and i think they've been sort of hard nosed about the entire thing [laughter]
sw2342B-ms98-a-0013 81.974625 90.055000 and uh you know in some sense m[ay]- the moderates may be right they may you know may be it is better if they give up just a little bit just to sort of settle things down
sw2342B-ms98-a-0014 90.055000 96.813625 [silence]
sw2342B-ms98-a-0015 96.813625 100.581750 right the[n]- then then it then is it worth it at all
sw2342B-ms98-a-0016 100.581750 104.501875 i mean i i because_1 the way i mean sort of the way to think about it is well
sw2342B-ms98-a-0017 104.501875 107.605000 they won you know they sort of took over the um
sw2342B-ms98-a-0018 107.605000 115.330000 they're one of the only countries in in in history that has been told that they have to give back what they took in a war which they didn't start
sw2342B-ms98-a-0019 115.330000 117.803750 basically so
sw2342B-ms98-a-0020 117.803750 127.694750 so i don't i don't know how to i don't i don't know what to do about it but um [noise] but i think that that you know in general the region is really in bad shape [noise]
sw2342B-ms98-a-0021 127.694750 131.667500 [silence]
sw2342B-ms98-a-0022 131.667500 136.935250 um probably oh isn't isn't there a plan now to make a command center there or something
sw2342B-ms98-a-0023 136.935250 142.907375 [silence]
sw2342B-ms98-a-0024 142.907375 146.695125 i just heard something about moving recently about moving um
sw2342B-ms98-a-0025 146.695125 154.119625 there there there's some central command post in Tampa i think they now want to move to somewhere in the Middle East
sw2342B-ms98-a-0026 154.119625 163.557125 actually there was um a small country or small city i think well you know not actually in Saudi Arabia or or anything but a little bit off to the um east of it i think
sw2342B-ms98-a-0027 163.557125 168.140375 and i they want to keep something over there so that they don't have to um
sw2342B-ms98-a-0028 168.140375 175.894875 i guess it's i guess it's so that so they don't have to move troops out so quickly or something i'm not quite sure exactly why they want to do it
sw2342B-ms98-a-0029 175.894875 178.908125 but they want to keep some sort of central command post there
sw2342B-ms98-a-0030 178.908125 185.264625 [silence]
sw2342B-ms98-a-0031 185.264625 186.330250 that's true
sw2342B-ms98-a-0032 186.330250 187.673625 [laughter] yeah
sw2342B-ms98-a-0033 187.673625 193.882125 [silence]
sw2342B-ms98-a-0034 193.882125 202.124500 yeah that th[ey]- th[ey]- they claim that's why we're still there i mean you know why only you note it's only only a small number of people have actually come back yet
sw2342B-ms98-a-0035 202.124500 208.371625 but i think that's actually the scariest part because when in the way what what's happening in Iraq right now
sw2342B-ms98-a-0036 208.371625 212.074500 you know just in itself it it it being so crazy there
sw2342B-ms98-a-0037 212.074500 219.237500 i have no idea what i mean what do you know just to imagine that one day they're going to turn around and someone's going to say we don't like you and just start attacking again and
sw2342B-ms98-a-0038 219.237500 221.200750 it's going to be worse
sw2342B-ms98-a-0039 221.200750 223.347625 i don't know um
sw2342B-ms98-a-0040 223.347625 224.533125 [silence]
sw2342B-ms98-a-0041 224.533125 230.402750 no i don't i ha[ve]- i i have some friends in Israel and and coincidently actually my wife is Syrian um
sw2342B-ms98-a-0042 230.402750 235.991500 yeah so i am we are sort of we are the Middle East peace talks at home um
sw2342B-ms98-a-0043 235.991500 242.091625 and uh pardon me i'm just sort of putting away some things from dinner now [laughter] in the background but we um we
sw2342B-ms98-a-0044 242.091625 253.224000 she has sort of friends and family in Saudi Arabia ac[tually]- well friends in Saudi Arabia and um i have some friends in Israel and we we talk a bit about it but we try and keep it out of out of the home life [laughter]
sw2342B-ms98-a-0045 253.224000 255.963750 [silence]
sw2342B-ms98-a-0046 255.963750 258.229125 no she was she's actually um
sw2342B-ms98-a-0047 258.229125 264.576000 i think it's um for her not not really relevant because she was she's second generation American actually
sw2342B-ms98-a-0048 264.576000 264.868625 [noise]
sw2342B-ms98-a-0049 264.868625 271.515875 her parents who were born here would like to go see it though i think they would like to go to Syria but but they recognize that Syria's not the place that one wants to visit
sw2342B-ms98-a-0050 271.515875 273.384000 right about now
sw2342B-ms98-a-0051 273.384000 278.037750 you know just something about the place makes it not not quite enjoyable
sw2342B-ms98-a-0052 278.037750 279.911875 [silence]
sw2342B-ms98-a-0053 279.911875 286.246000 yeah i i'd actually been there um i was there a couple years ago when it wasn't as you know sort of dangerous to be out there i guess
sw2342B-ms98-a-0054 286.246000 296.471000 and i do i d[o]- i do like it actually um i would never live there i think i'm too Americanized and um sort of have too much you know too much invested in sort of
sw2342B-ms98-a-0055 296.471000 300.373375 th[e]- the easy life but i do like the food
sw2342B-ms98-a-0056 300.373375 302.494750 if that if so
sw2342B-ms98-a-0057 302.494750 305.010000 if that if if that amounts for anything
sw2342B-ms98-a-0058 305.010000 310.023125 [silence]
sw2342B-ms98-a-0059 310.023125 315.440375 yeah actually my house is Kosher but um it turns out that o[ne]- one of the strangest things about about Israel is that
sw2342B-ms98-a-0060 315.440375 321.532375 no um most folks don't realize that but all the food that people think of as sort of you know Jewish food and so forth um
sw2342B-ms98-a-0061 321.532375 329.863000 and you know um in general really isn't the food that is eaten in Israel so you you i'm sure you probably typically think of it like bagels right you know bagels and lox
sw2342B-ms98-a-0062 329.863000 330.623000 [noise]
sw2342B-ms98-a-0063 330.623000 343.405250 turns out you don't you don't you don't really find bagels in Israel what you find is sort of Middle Eastern foods the same foods that you find in um Syria and Egypt and everything else you find things called [vocalized-noise] have you ever had those
sw2342B-ms98-a-0064 343.405250 344.642750 which is
sw2342B-ms98-a-0065 344.642750 346.725750 [silence]
sw2342B-ms98-a-0066 346.725750 353.096750 oh oh knishes no you don't y[ou]- you you don't see a lot of that that's basically Eastern European Jewish food
sw2342B-ms98-a-0067 353.096750 363.254125 it's it's very different i'm i i was actually very amazed when i sort of figured this out for myself that everything i grew up with really wasn't Israeli it was more Jewish you know
sw2342B-ms98-a-0068 363.254125 366.719625 it it it it is very strange um
sw2342B-ms98-a-0069 366.719625 368.693500 [silence]
sw2342B-ms98-a-0070 368.693500 370.690000 that that starts tomorrow night
sw2342B-ms98-a-0071 370.690000 373.278125 that's what i'm making that's what i'm doing now i'm making dinner
sw2342B-ms98-a-0072 373.278125 387.634125 [silence]
sw2342B-ms98-a-0073 387.634125 390.626875 ought to buy the bread from [laughter]
sw2342B-ms98-a-0074 390.626875 393.799625 that's great well you've you've you've really got a handle on this stuff i've noticed you
sw2342B-ms98-a-0075 393.799625 396.500000 got got the vocabulary down and everything
sw2342B-ms98-a-0076 396.500000 399.560625 [silence]
sw2342B-ms98-a-0077 399.560625 410.140875 that that that's actually real good yeah we um we actually we have the reverse situation turns out that um um most of my friends aren't Jewish and and and my wife's not but i
sw2342B-ms98-a-0078 410.140875 423.884875 but i um i sort of you know do a lot of these things so so that um Seder's you know our our first Seder is tomorrow night and this is a rare exception there are going to be sixteen people at my house tomorrow night which and five of them will be Jewish
sw2342B-ms98-a-0079 423.884875 428.368750 two two years ago we had a Seder we had sixteen people each night
sw2342B-ms98-a-0080 428.368750 430.812125 sixteen seems the magic number for us
sw2342B-ms98-a-0081 430.812125 432.681375 and i was the only Jew both nights
sw2342B-ms98-a-0082 432.681375 433.633375 [laughter-so]
sw2342B-ms98-a-0083 433.633375 439.368375 [laughter-so] which to me is wonderful because it means that people who never would get these to see this um
sw2342B-ms98-a-0084 439.368375 441.391625 so get to see it and my view is
sw2342B-ms98-a-0085 441.391625 449.542375 Passover is should sort of be i[n]- in in in in in my mind Passover is sort of a generic holiday anyway because it it sort of predates Christ
sw2342B-ms98-a-0086 449.542375 450.609125 so
sw2342B-ms98-a-0087 450.609125 455.324750 [silence]
sw2342B-ms98-a-0088 455.324750 457.632250 oh yeah i caught the end of that
sw2342B-ms98-a-0089 457.632250 460.958750 yeah every year i try and catch that
sw2342B-ms98-a-0090 460.958750 465.048000 but yeah that's what always amazes me actually is that um
sw2342B-ms98-a-0091 465.048000 475.691875 is that you know my my wife and i always sort of bring this up about sh[e]- her her being Syrian you know and my being Jewish and all we look alike we act alike we sound alike well not totally alike but you know
sw2342B-ms98-a-0092 475.691875 480.348250 um um it's amazing to think that people in the Middle East sort of all hate each other
sw2342B-ms98-a-0093 480.348250 503.971000 [silence]
sw2342B-ms98-a-0094 503.971000 505.403750 right
sw2342B-ms98-a-0095 505.403750 514.096625 [silence]
sw2342B-ms98-a-0096 514.096625 528.508250 right that that's actually the part that that that i find really strange i mean i i i sort of understand somewhat i mean i i knowing the history i understand that the hatred of the Muslims for you know the Israelis or whatever and i can sort of handle i can sort of handle that and the Palestinians
sw2342B-ms98-a-0097 528.508250 533.358125 but i sort of think about the Muslims sort of running around having jihads against themselves
sw2342B-ms98-a-0098 533.358125 536.854000 you know i mean and and that seems really weird
sw2342B-ms98-a-0099 536.854000 541.118000 [silence]
sw2342B-ms98-a-0100 541.118000 543.238875 right exactly
sw2342B-ms98-a-0101 543.238875 545.384750 same same thing
sw2342B-ms98-a-0102 545.384750 550.003875 i don't i'll i'll i'll never understand it uh my view is look what'd you ever do to me
sw2342B-ms98-a-0103 550.003875 551.753000 [silence]
sw2342B-ms98-a-0104 551.753000 564.580625 didn't hurt me you know at at at the moment so um and and i i don't know there's a there's something about there's a poem somewhere i don't know if you've ever seen it or not um um Everything I Ever Wanted to Know I Learned in Kindergarten
sw2342B-ms98-a-0105 564.580625 578.360375 have you ever seen this and it talks about how you know if we could just all get toge[ther]- you know when we were young everything was great because_1 we you know just sort of all went to class together and in the mi[ddle]- you know we all had snack time together and then we all took naps and we all held hands and hugged
sw2342B-ms98-a-0106 578.360375 589.073375 you know and tha[t's]- and tha[t's]- and that's what that's what kindergarten was like and wouldn't it be nice if if we could solve all our problems by just sort of getting together and everyone in the world sat down and and took a nap together
sw2342B-ms98-a-0107 589.073375 592.944875 woke up and had snack time you know and then hugged each other a[s]- as we left
sw2342B-ms98-a-0108 592.944875 595.867500 [silence]
sw2342B-ms98-a-0109 595.867500 599.424875 yeah [laughter] i wonder if he secretly did that
