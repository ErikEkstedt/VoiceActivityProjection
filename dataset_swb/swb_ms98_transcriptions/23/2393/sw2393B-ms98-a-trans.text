sw2393B-ms98-a-0002 1.203750 9.772375 okay well um we lived i grew up in San Antonio and uh i was used to the heat and i was used to what couldn't grow [laughter]
sw2393B-ms98-a-0003 9.772375 11.574000 down there and uh
sw2393B-ms98-a-0004 11.574000 17.722125 we had a small um farm house out in Castroville which is just uh to the west of San Antonio
sw2393B-ms98-a-0005 17.722125 25.686875 and we did a lot of gardening out there and uh mostly in raised beds so we could keep the uh soil uh nice
sw2393B-ms98-a-0006 25.686875 31.659875 because basically out there it was mostly a clay soil very hard to to grow very hard to cultivate
sw2393B-ms98-a-0007 31.659875 40.382625 and when we came up here uh to California uh we're in the Monterrey area and it's very uh nice sandy soil rich soil
sw2393B-ms98-a-0008 40.382625 45.019125 and the weather is perfect for growing just about anything you want to grow
sw2393B-ms98-a-0009 45.019125 55.566125 so we've been out here um well really in in the house since December and we've been uh planting flowers that we could never plant in San Antonio uh
sw2393B-ms98-a-0010 55.566125 63.600500 because the heat would just dry them up after you know about uh three good weeks of nice weather before the heat started
sw2393B-ms98-a-0011 63.600500 75.960125 and here they uh are supposed to last year around and so we have some really pretty flowers growing and uh we're at the edge of a forest area so there's a lot of uh pine mulch
sw2393B-ms98-a-0012 75.960125 82.306500 uh just about anything you would want in Texas as a gardener is here uh just around us you know 
sw2393B-ms98-a-0013 82.306500 85.326750 we got here at the end of about a four year drought
sw2393B-ms98-a-0014 85.326750 93.326000 uh we've had a whole lot of rain uh it's been raining pretty much continually now uh off and on maybe one day of break for about a month
sw2393B-ms98-a-0015 93.326000 97.021625 so yeah we're getting replenished and so there is uh
sw2393B-ms98-a-0016 97.021625 101.639500 when i first came here it everything was yellow the grass was dead everywhere
sw2393B-ms98-a-0017 101.639500 109.367875 and now with all the rain everything is just gorgeous lush and green and beautiful and i hope that it holds out here after the summer
sw2393B-ms98-a-0018 109.367875 117.394125 but uh that has been uh the major change that we have noticed in gardening and that's about the extent of what we've done just a little bit on the patio and
sw2393B-ms98-a-0019 117.394125 124.514375 uh and waiting for the the rain to subside so we can [laughter-mow] we after about a month we finally got to mow this weekend
sw2393B-ms98-a-0020 124.514375 130.476625 but um we're just so happy to see green it's just so nice we haven't really done too much else other than that
sw2393B-ms98-a-0021 130.476625 134.355000 [vocalized-noise]

sw2393B-ms98-a-0046 229.632250 232.571625 just get grass to grow i know
sw2393B-ms98-a-0047 232.571625 236.508875 [silence]
sw2393B-ms98-a-0048 236.508875 237.857875 uh-huh
sw2393B-ms98-a-0049 237.857875 248.466375 well when we had our house um out in Castroville the problem with ours is that the uh plots there are a third of an acre and
sw2393B-ms98-a-0050 248.466375 256.407875 trying to keep grass alive during a summer on uh a piece of ground that big was expensive [laughter]
sw2393B-ms98-a-0051 256.407875 268.310000 and to water it and uh eventually well especially when it was so bad last year well i guess it was the year before now uh it was so hot that year that was the year that i think it started out a hundred in February
sw2393B-ms98-a-0052 268.310000 280.370500 um we were just watering all the time finally what we did was we said we're going to have to let the back yard die it's going to have to do whatever it's going to do because we can't really afford the front yard
sw2393B-ms98-a-0053 280.370500 283.727625 and uh so when we left you know the back yard had
sw2393B-ms98-a-0054 283.727625 294.951750 and the Saint um i think it was Saint Augustine that we had um i[t]- it had held onto a small portion but primarily once the weeds start in the back
sw2393B-ms98-a-0055 294.951750 304.758000 yeah we were just re[signed]- you know resigned to well the only way we were going to fix this one is that you know if you plow it all under and put everything back on top of it again
sw2393B-ms98-a-0056 304.758000 313.713625 but i don't know that's the bad thing there is that we spent so much money or you would spend so much money trying to keep a a large lawn alive
sw2393B-ms98-a-0057 313.713625 322.966875 that was the only thing i didn't like about lawns and we were sitting there wondering there must be a better way to landscape so that you don't have to spend so much money trying to keep the lawn alive and green and the weeds out
sw2393B-ms98-a-0058 322.966875 324.248750 so

sw2393B-ms98-a-0070 368.757000 373.560000 yeah i imagine so well everybody it seems like everyone is so particular
sw2393B-ms98-a-0071 373.560000 383.682375 especially in um the Dallas area you know there's there's so much money and everyone can afford they have enough leisure time to afford a nice lawn and
sw2393B-ms98-a-0072 383.682375 396.222250 another thing i've noticed is that the lawns in some of the homes the area is so small that they take great pride in being able to to use whatever lawn they do have to look really nice
sw2393B-ms98-a-0073 396.222250 402.162125 [silence]
sw2393B-ms98-a-0074 402.162125 403.499375 uh-huh

sw2393B-ms98-a-0079 416.541125 421.139875 [silence]
sw2393B-ms98-a-0080 421.139875 426.662250 right i know oh it's it's awful the first house well th[e]- our house in Castroville was the first one too
sw2393B-ms98-a-0081 426.662250 432.534625 and uh we had no idea the expense that lawns and gardening [laughter] would run into
sw2393B-ms98-a-0082 432.534625 441.391875 and the time that it took especially when you start mowing and then when it comes to fertilize then it would come to raking and then when it comes to making sure that somebody had put the timer on the water
sw2393B-ms98-a-0083 441.391875 452.477875 and uh the one thing that i did notice is that people that have the underground uh irrigation systems the sprinkler systems just that was the way to go if you could do it people that were building the new homes that put those in 
sw2393B-ms98-a-0084 452.477875 453.586875 that was
sw2393B-ms98-a-0085 453.586875 461.407375 that was the only way to go because it was just so convenient they would just turn it on and the timer would run and it would water their lawn and they didn't have to worry about it at all
sw2393B-ms98-a-0086 461.407375 467.920375 and that was so nice but we didn't have that luxury so we were dragging the the sprinkler around everywhere and uh
sw2393B-ms98-a-0087 467.920375 476.964875 so i hope you can find uh i don't know what type of grass grows in uh the real shady areas i remember the guy that was on the radio
sw2393B-ms98-a-0088 476.964875 479.753250 um they had a gardener
sw2393B-ms98-a-0089 479.753250 492.209375 and he i don't know i had this one well i've still got the book it's um i think it's just called Texas Gardening and it talks about the different grasses to use uh for the shady areas versus the really sunny areas
sw2393B-ms98-a-0090 492.209375 499.858000 and but there is a grass that you can use that is shade tolerant but i don't remember what it is but it's got like a boot on the front of the the book
sw2393B-ms98-a-0091 499.858000 503.840375 it's just a real fancy decorated boot it's like Texas Gardening
sw2393B-ms98-a-0092 503.840375 518.202875 and it talks about um you know different problems that your lawn can have and how to recognize it and it goes into the full gamut of gardening you know everything from flowers to bulbs to perennials to grass to weeds to trees and to uh how to prune
sw2393B-ms98-a-0093 518.202875 530.998625 but one of the things i do remember was when it talked about uh the grass and there there being [vocalized-noise] the shade tolerant types of grass and i think one of them was a blend of two types of grass that they had used
sw2393B-ms98-a-0094 530.998625 537.181750 but i don't remem[ber]- i don't remember if it was Raleigh and Saint Augustine or or what but i do remember they had used a blend
sw2393B-ms98-a-0095 537.181750 542.997375 [silence]
sw2393B-ms98-a-0096 542.997375 544.299375 uh-huh

sw2393B-ms98-a-0098 554.578750 555.919875 oh
sw2393B-ms98-a-0099 555.919875 562.551625 but that's so neat because so many homes don't have that so you'll be cool all year around in the summer that's great
sw2393B-ms98-a-0100 562.551625 563.552750 [silence]
sw2393B-ms98-a-0101 563.552750 564.778500 uh-huh
sw2393B-ms98-a-0102 564.778500 566.546125 [vocalized-noise]
sw2393B-ms98-a-0103 566.546125 568.756750 it makes the biggest difference
sw2393B-ms98-a-0104 568.756750 570.910875 when you have the big old trees
sw2393B-ms98-a-0105 570.910875 584.254875 and the people that moved in next to us they built a new house on the empty lot and they just had their brand new little trees They didn't have any shade [laughter] they any time they had people over they had to do it on the patio because it just got too hot during the day
sw2393B-ms98-a-0106 584.254875 588.791125 so oh that's great that you have them are they oaks that around there
sw2393B-ms98-a-0107 588.791125 591.354500 oh that's even better
sw2393B-ms98-a-0108 591.354500 592.429500 [silence]
