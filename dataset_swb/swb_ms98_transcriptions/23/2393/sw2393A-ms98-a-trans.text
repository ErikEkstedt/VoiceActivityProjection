sw2393A-ms98-a-0033 131.429250 137.657250 well we um we just moved to our first home and we had lived in a condominium before so
sw2393A-ms98-a-0034 137.657250 145.315875 we didn't have any lawn and garden type duties so we're just learning the ropes here and
sw2393A-ms98-a-0035 145.315875 155.144000 but when we moved in um our backyard has so many big tall trees in it that um there just there wasn't even a blade of grass in the backyard
sw2393A-ms98-a-0036 155.144000 166.554875 so we're you know going talking to some of our friends that are landscapers and things and learning about different kinds of grass we [laughter-trying] to go grow grass and it just seems so funny to me
sw2393A-ms98-a-0037 166.554875 173.617500 that when i grew up in Missouri and you didn't have to worry about growing grass there it just happened [laughter-automatically]
sw2393A-ms98-a-0038 173.617500 174.653750 so
sw2393A-ms98-a-0039 174.653750 176.658875 [silence]
sw2393A-ms98-a-0040 176.658875 183.334875 yes we are we we tried we planted some fescue last um fall
sw2393A-ms98-a-0041 183.334875 189.893750 and it['s]- it's really really pretty and um [noise] and green it stayed pretty pretty green throughout the winter
sw2393A-ms98-a-0042 189.893750 191.299250 and uh
sw2393A-ms98-a-0043 191.299250 198.021000 and it's pretty goo[d]- it's not as thick and as nice it doesn't look like it can withstand too much you know
sw2393A-ms98-a-0044 198.021000 199.619375 [silence]
sw2393A-ms98-a-0045 199.619375 206.996250 it's supposed to die off like in August and then you re[plant]- replant it in September
sw2393A-ms98-a-0046 206.996250 208.252875 and uh
sw2393A-ms98-a-0047 208.252875 219.380625 so but we don't the Saint Augustine and all that supposedly was back there just wasn't like i say there really wasn't even one blade of grass in the backyard
sw2393A-ms98-a-0048 219.380625 221.095000 and um
sw2393A-ms98-a-0049 221.095000 228.242750 so mostly you know we're not even to the point where we're getting into flowers and flower beds or or even gardens that
sw2393A-ms98-a-0050 228.242750 231.656125 we're just saying let's get [laughter-some] [laughter-grass]
sw2393A-ms98-a-0051 231.656125 237.516750 let's get grass so that the kids can play in the yard and not have to be worried about the dirt so much you know

sw2393A-ms98-a-0070 324.224125 336.958875 it's pretty remarkable because growing up we've always had a beautiful lush green lawn and we never there was no such thing as watering your lawns in Missouri i mean it just happened
sw2393A-ms98-a-0071 336.958875 347.160750 and um so it's been real fun here to see there's a big market for the nurseries and for the landscaping companies and a lot of people
sw2393A-ms98-a-0072 347.160750 350.970625 um um we live in north of Dallas and um

sw2393A-ms98-a-0077 356.799875 367.156625 and so there's a lot of uh market up here since it's kind of the area that people are moving into in the Dallas area and big market for
sw2393A-ms98-a-0078 367.156625 369.115125 for yards yard work

sw2393A-ms98-a-0086 395.418125 404.253250 yes they do i noticed that they're really putting in small back yards because they have these most of the houses have the alleys that run behind
sw2393A-ms98-a-0087 404.253250 407.891000 and so that really cuts into your backyard space and
sw2393A-ms98-a-0088 407.891000 412.379125 but we don't do our work here out of enjoyment so much just
sw2393A-ms98-a-0089 412.379125 420.363875 right now we're just this is we just moved in in September so we're just still at the point where we're talking about the
