sw2352B-ms98-a-0054 211.052750 212.087875 and i
sw2352B-ms98-a-0055 212.087875 214.523375 or they starve because_1 they can't eat

sw2352B-ms98-a-0064 237.695000 243.355875 well they keep saying that but i'll tell you i i saw a program not too many months ago
sw2352B-ms98-a-0065 243.355875 257.069500 i think it was on Arts and Entertainment or Discovery one of the two and they're talking about all these people who are making uh all these boast that you know we're dolphin free and all that kind of stuff and they just they showed them_1 to be absolute liars
sw2352B-ms98-a-0066 257.069500 264.340375 yeah because you know people like Starkist they don't go out there and catch the fish they buy the fish from other people
sw2352B-ms98-a-0067 264.340375 270.531375 and and and all these people do is tell them oh no no no no we have we have these safety nets now
sw2352B-ms98-a-0068 270.531375 271.516375 sure
sw2352B-ms98-a-0069 271.516375 273.186250 that's right trust us
sw2352B-ms98-a-0070 273.186250 276.123625 yeah they had some they had some uh
sw2352B-ms98-a-0071 276.123625 283.629250 uh undercover film of these people and they they netted oh i mean dozens of dolphins
sw2352B-ms98-a-0072 283.629250 286.568375 and they killed probably half of them_1
sw2352B-ms98-a-0073 286.568375 289.551375 yeah it is i like dolphins too

sw2352B-ms98-a-0082 330.573125 335.021000 well i think what they need to do is to come up with a better way of shrimp farming
sw2352B-ms98-a-0083 335.021000 345.976875 i mean th[ere's]- there's i- i don't see any reason why they can't uh i mean there's a lot of places Japan for instance have shrimp farms i mean they they they raise shrimp

sw2352B-ms98-a-0085 347.036750 355.474500 jus[t]- just like they raise anything else and and you can do it and the uh the the collection is very easy
sw2352B-ms98-a-0086 355.474500 359.658625 and you don't go around killing everything else that happens to be in the area

sw2352B-ms98-a-0143 565.507375 575.247500 and then they could have their agenda for all these different problems and come up with solutions but i mean you know work at it as an organization not as a little group
