sw2352A-ms98-a-0005 6.616750 10.259500 and how and do we have any ideas to encourage more recycling
sw2352A-ms98-a-0006 10.259500 12.304250 [silence]
sw2352A-ms98-a-0007 12.304250 15.661625 well it is to me uh because
sw2352A-ms98-a-0008 15.661625 23.297375 we're our particular little household is hot and heavy we have our glass bin our tin bin and uh our uh
sw2352A-ms98-a-0009 23.297375 27.029250 papers that we accumulate and recycle and
sw2352A-ms98-a-0010 27.029250 28.543875 Plano Texas
sw2352A-ms98-a-0011 28.543875 31.142875 [silence]
sw2352A-ms98-a-0012 31.142875 34.020000 yes they certainly do they certainly do
sw2352A-ms98-a-0013 34.020000 37.944750 [silence]
sw2352A-ms98-a-0014 37.944750 39.089750 where are you

sw2352A-ms98-a-0017 41.392875 62.795750 [silence]
sw2352A-ms98-a-0018 62.795750 73.586750 well our libraries and then the uh Wal-Mart stores have the bins in back of them_1 and when you recycle glass
sw2352A-ms98-a-0019 73.586750 80.140625 that seems to make a lot of difference and you have the colored glass and the clear glass and the paper and the tin cans
sw2352A-ms98-a-0020 80.140625 88.238125 so when you get all of that going it is it it occupies a space in your garage but you very quickly get use to it and we do not
sw2352A-ms98-a-0021 88.238125 89.294375 [silence]
sw2352A-ms98-a-0022 89.294375 99.589250 sure well you know we haul it off i[t]- once in a while and we also do not bag our clippings on our lawns we let the wind blow it off we do not fill

sw2352A-ms98-a-0028 112.307750 117.794750 lots of grass give it twenty four hours and the whole things gone there's no problem someone else is worrying about
sw2352A-ms98-a-0029 117.794750 130.104875 and we have somebody else's but uh the problem that bothers me more uh you know i think the communities will do as good as they are supported by their local government you know
sw2352A-ms98-a-0030 130.104875 136.560875 if there's if there's enough need and they have a responsive local city management
sw2352A-ms98-a-0031 136.560875 138.167500 it will happen
sw2352A-ms98-a-0032 138.167500 146.080250 what upsets me uh there was an article and i'm sorry i was reading a book at the same time it was on our Texas beaches
sw2352A-ms98-a-0033 146.080250 152.176250 and they are s[aying]- our Texas beaches are suppose to be the dirtiest beaches in the United States
sw2352A-ms98-a-0034 152.176250 152.894625 [silence]
sw2352A-ms98-a-0035 152.894625 157.523000 and it's not because of litter it's because of boats
sw2352A-ms98-a-0036 157.523000 164.981875 the if you could think of the basin the Texas gulf coast as a large swirling
sw2352A-ms98-a-0037 164.981875 172.172125 vacuum things that are thrown from ships swirl in and swirl in to our beaches
sw2352A-ms98-a-0038 172.172125 174.539500 and it kills some of our animals
sw2352A-ms98-a-0039 174.539500 180.632875 there's there's a professor down there that has Texas A and M has a nice size facility
sw2352A-ms98-a-0040 180.632875 182.421125 at Port Aransas
sw2352A-ms98-a-0041 182.421125 188.192750 and he's got all these collection of animals that he's frozen that were killed you know by plastic
sw2352A-ms98-a-0042 188.192750 192.086375 it's horrible it's a gross collection
sw2352A-ms98-a-0043 192.086375 196.920750 [silence]

sw2352A-ms98-a-0048 210.606250 213.844125 that's right or they starve to death because they can't swallow
sw2352A-ms98-a-0049 213.844125 215.225000 or drowned
sw2352A-ms98-a-0050 215.225000 215.973500 yeah
sw2352A-ms98-a-0051 215.973500 217.177250 terrific

sw2352A-ms98-a-0053 219.804000 225.221000 well they showed one baby turtle that had been caught up in some uh plastic
sw2352A-ms98-a-0054 225.221000 228.927250 and it starved to death it couldn't it couldn't swallow it was pitiful

sw2352A-ms98-a-0056 234.580125 238.373750 well they're suppose to h[ave]- be working t[owards]- around that

sw2352A-ms98-a-0058 252.756500 254.007750 uh-huh

sw2352A-ms98-a-0062 263.788000 265.180000 sure so
sw2352A-ms98-a-0063 265.180000 269.536500 [silence]
sw2352A-ms98-a-0064 269.536500 273.844625 trust us it's our nets everything's great go back sleep and don't worry
sw2352A-ms98-a-0065 273.844625 277.937625 [silence]
sw2352A-ms98-a-0066 277.937625 279.143875 oh
sw2352A-ms98-a-0067 279.143875 285.921500 [silence]
sw2352A-ms98-a-0068 285.921500 287.385375 oh that's just sickening
sw2352A-ms98-a-0069 287.385375 287.970000 [noise]
sw2352A-ms98-a-0070 287.970000 289.660750 [silence]
sw2352A-ms98-a-0071 289.660750 295.243000 well and the other thing uh we have an endangered species turtle a Ridley's turtle
sw2352A-ms98-a-0072 295.243000 297.616125 that's on the Texas Gulf Coast
sw2352A-ms98-a-0073 297.616125 304.268375 and there's our shrimp nets are suppose to be turtle proof so the turtles can swim through
sw2352A-ms98-a-0074 304.268375 307.081125 huge fight going on
sw2352A-ms98-a-0075 307.081125 319.798625 uh the shrimpers just say great you want us to put a big hole in our nets is that what you want us to do [laughter] this makes sense to us we're starving to death anyway and you want us to put a hole in our nets i can see their point
sw2352A-ms98-a-0076 319.798625 327.153000 i i guess if my family were terribly hungry i wouldn't be as humanistic as i am because i don't have that problem
sw2352A-ms98-a-0077 327.153000 332.346000 so it's it's really a hard hard issue to say what's right and what's not
sw2352A-ms98-a-0078 332.346000 334.994000 [silence]
sw2352A-ms98-a-0079 334.994000 336.042625 oh this is
sw2352A-ms98-a-0080 336.042625 345.894625 [silence]
sw2352A-ms98-a-0081 345.894625 348.569625 like they raise catfish now
sw2352A-ms98-a-0082 348.569625 359.051500 [silence]
sw2352A-ms98-a-0083 359.051500 365.534250 well part of the problem there is so many of the fishermen work for so little money
sw2352A-ms98-a-0084 365.534250 367.595375 we have a lot of Vietnamese
sw2352A-ms98-a-0085 367.595375 369.097125 fisher people
sw2352A-ms98-a-0086 369.097125 374.193000 and ye[t]- they support their whole family on less than than i'd had for lunch
sw2352A-ms98-a-0087 374.193000 375.524375 anyway
sw2352A-ms98-a-0088 375.524375 379.205500 and of course they don't have the money to make an investment like that
sw2352A-ms98-a-0089 379.205500 386.684875 and it it all goes back to the government spending enough money high enough priorities on things like that
sw2352A-ms98-a-0090 386.684875 391.680625 that they it would have to be government owned or s[upported]- financed if not controlled
sw2352A-ms98-a-0091 391.680625 395.072125 there because the financing simply isn't there
sw2352A-ms98-a-0092 395.072125 398.463625 because it's one of those cottage industries that uh
sw2352A-ms98-a-0093 398.463625 403.258375 the very poor keep going but can't do anything to change
sw2352A-ms98-a-0094 403.258375 405.855750 [silence]
sw2352A-ms98-a-0095 405.855750 406.959375 sure
sw2352A-ms98-a-0096 406.959375 408.751000 [silence]
sw2352A-ms98-a-0097 408.751000 413.440375 well and you know they could they could be terribly sorry they're killing the turtles you know
sw2352A-ms98-a-0098 413.440375 414.560000 [silence]
sw2352A-ms98-a-0099 414.560000 416.428250 probably are probably are
sw2352A-ms98-a-0100 416.428250 419.401750 [silence]
sw2352A-ms98-a-0101 419.401750 420.992500 well they may do it
sw2352A-ms98-a-0102 420.992500 422.503500 [silence]
sw2352A-ms98-a-0103 422.503500 425.414750 whether they like it or not they may do it you know
sw2352A-ms98-a-0104 425.414750 430.955625 y[eah]- that's correct turtle is very good that's the other thing wrong with the poor turtles [laughter]
sw2352A-ms98-a-0105 430.955625 437.049250 [silence]
sw2352A-ms98-a-0106 437.049250 443.795125 well in my unreformed days i have had turtle soup in New Orleans and i can tell you it's fabulous
sw2352A-ms98-a-0107 443.795125 447.644625 but of course a boot would taste fabulous when they finish with it
sw2352A-ms98-a-0108 447.644625 449.853750 [silence]
sw2352A-ms98-a-0109 449.853750 453.074500 [laughter-so] it's no telling what the turtle really taste like
sw2352A-ms98-a-0110 453.074500 455.053250 [silence]
sw2352A-ms98-a-0111 455.053250 459.398625 well it maybe it wasn't you know who who knows what i had but it was fabulous
sw2352A-ms98-a-0112 459.398625 465.626500 [silence]
sw2352A-ms98-a-0113 465.626500 467.478125 great sure it is
sw2352A-ms98-a-0114 467.478125 469.795625 charge fifteen keep moving
sw2352A-ms98-a-0115 469.795625 471.837000 [silence]
sw2352A-ms98-a-0116 471.837000 474.009000 as long as it's French

sw2352A-ms98-a-0120 477.744750 486.906125 oh dear well i don't have any my big solutions all go back to elect politicians that are more sensitive because i think we can't do it ourselves
sw2352A-ms98-a-0121 486.906125 492.520000 [silence]
sw2352A-ms98-a-0122 492.520000 494.117500 you need clout
sw2352A-ms98-a-0123 494.117500 519.499375 [silence]
sw2352A-ms98-a-0124 519.499375 529.317125 it'd be great but the problem with that is you have all of these little branches off the main problem and everyone is very concerned about one thing
sw2352A-ms98-a-0125 529.317125 534.227625 you know like the woman down the tip of Texas that that
sw2352A-ms98-a-0126 534.227625 540.831375 calls her turtles and kisses everyone of them_1 everyday she's terribly interested in her turtles she could care less about shrimp
sw2352A-ms98-a-0127 540.831375 545.575375 and on she goes you just kind of think everybody's got such a splintered interest
sw2352A-ms98-a-0128 545.575375 547.531625 [silence]
sw2352A-ms98-a-0129 547.531625 549.289875 yeah that's exactly it
sw2352A-ms98-a-0130 549.289875 559.013625 and there's no way to to to make one group more interested or sensitive to the other group but they can be but they're not sensitive on the bottom line which means money
sw2352A-ms98-a-0131 559.013625 577.657625 [silence]
sw2352A-ms98-a-0132 577.657625 582.541000 that's why i keep going back to the politicians that it has to have some focal spot
sw2352A-ms98-a-0133 582.541000 587.780875 we we need uh we need an environmental Ralph Nader type
sw2352A-ms98-a-0134 587.780875 589.347625 which
sw2352A-ms98-a-0135 589.347625 590.405375 [laughter]
sw2352A-ms98-a-0136 590.405375 591.403625 gee
