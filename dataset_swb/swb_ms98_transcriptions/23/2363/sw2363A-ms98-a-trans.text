sw2363A-ms98-a-0075 310.851625 321.259375 and it and i'm sure there are some bugs in it and eventually maybe they'll work them_1 out it it's been a tough year to get this all done and get everybody on it and
sw2363A-ms98-a-0076 321.259375 323.279875 it's uh
sw2363A-ms98-a-0077 323.279875 332.312125 but it's showing it's rewards now i think uh oh the stop pays and people coming off of L O A and everything people are really getting the hang of it now

sw2363A-ms98-a-0081 350.253750 351.038000 [silence]

sw2363A-ms98-a-0084 360.375125 364.145125 see i don't have to go in and approve time okay so i i really
sw2363A-ms98-a-0085 364.145125 377.922000 don't know what y'all are going through to be honest with you to sit there in option one and approve everybody's time i didn't do it before and i don't do it now so i don't have anything to compare that with for us in communicating with peo[ple]- with everybody
sw2363A-ms98-a-0086 377.922000 392.297750 and and being able to see what you are doing and everything it's really been a a a godsend it's been wonderful getting everybody on the same system it's been great and an easy system that everybody seems to be able to learn you know it's been really good
sw2363A-ms98-a-0087 392.297750 395.699875 [silence]
sw2363A-ms98-a-0088 395.699875 401.263500 [laughter] that's a TI benefit new [laughter]
sw2363A-ms98-a-0089 401.263500 414.679375 [silence]
sw2363A-ms98-a-0090 414.679375 419.952125 now i don't know who planned it all or ho[w]- i don't even know how they came about
sw2363A-ms98-a-0091 419.952125 426.057500 uh agreeing on what all to do and with i know they're were programmers involved and i know the manager and
sw2363A-ms98-a-0092 426.057500 439.400500 the two managers and uh payroll were involved in supervisors and all but uh i came in last year out of one of the shops so uh it was all new to me i had to learn the old system and the new system
sw2363A-ms98-a-0093 439.400500 441.887500 [laughter] that was fun
sw2363A-ms98-a-0094 441.887500 455.456625 that was [laughter-fun] and then after i had finally got it all down they said now forget the old system oh yeah sure [laughter] thanks a lot so so for me the new system really was
sw2363A-ms98-a-0095 455.456625 461.543625 was easier you know it really it really was is easier to work i think
sw2363A-ms98-a-0096 461.543625 474.349500 so but that's just from my point of view like i said i don't have to sit down and de[pending]- depending on how many work rooms you have and everything you know it could be a real problem maybe to approve everybody [noise]
sw2363A-ms98-a-0097 474.349500 485.906125 [silence]
sw2363A-ms98-a-0098 485.906125 487.268375 yeah
sw2363A-ms98-a-0099 487.268375 493.175375 yeah but you have to go in and and individually check everybody

sw2363A-ms98-a-0104 501.523250 510.931000 they're several things that have uh changed already on it and now you're going to ask me what and i can't tell you offhand i just know we've had several [laughter-changes] it [laughter-just] [laughter] 
sw2363A-ms98-a-0105 510.931000 514.027500 [silence]

sw2363A-ms98-a-0111 525.009500 535.365250 that i think that was the most difficult thing for people to pick up on was stopping and starting people's pay mainly because you can do it now and it's easy and it's so easy that people go
sw2363A-ms98-a-0112 535.365250 546.959375 was that all i have to do it you know [laughter] there's got to be something else i have to do and i'm no it's just really easy and setting up your own cost your own uh work groups now too where as we had to do it before
sw2363A-ms98-a-0113 546.959375 561.790250 for you and now all you have to do is go in and put in a number and you got it you know so uh just put people in pick a number and put people in it and it's a work group so you know i think uh it's [vocalized-noise] really a lot simpler than the old one
sw2363A-ms98-a-0114 561.790250 574.343875 [silence]
