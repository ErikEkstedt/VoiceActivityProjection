sw2363B-ms98-a-0033 128.312250 137.984750 i was just thinking about uh something uh uh kind of close to one of our guys in H R D their personnel and they uh
sw2363B-ms98-a-0034 137.984750 144.793500 he's been talking about this thing called flex benefits for quite a while and uh i think that's a interesting concept
sw2363B-ms98-a-0035 144.793500 146.809625 ever heard of that
sw2363B-ms98-a-0036 146.809625 148.866500 [noise] be kind of like
sw2363B-ms98-a-0037 148.866500 156.221875 smorgasbord of benefits where you could uh tailor your benefit package to your own individual needs and so forth
sw2363B-ms98-a-0038 156.221875 163.525000 in other words if you were uh interested in having more vacation you could do that and then take cutback a little bit on some uh other area
sw2363B-ms98-a-0039 163.525000 164.528875 [silence]
sw2363B-ms98-a-0040 164.528875 170.623250 or uh you know increase your hospital benefits if you were in had a lot kids or something like that or
sw2363B-ms98-a-0041 170.623250 174.428125 or in your case you might want to cut the hospital back a little bit and
sw2363B-ms98-a-0042 174.428125 178.180250 yeah whatever i mean it's uh you know across the board

sw2363B-ms98-a-0044 181.163750 182.338750 it's a
sw2363B-ms98-a-0045 182.338750 191.677625 yeah it's something they talked about for several years now i don't know if that he are getting any closer the problem is that some people might go a little bit overboard [laughter]
sw2363B-ms98-a-0046 191.677625 194.373125 in picking out what they want and
sw2363B-ms98-a-0047 194.373125 195.896125 leave themselves
sw2363B-ms98-a-0048 195.896125 198.518750 too short in other areas i guess

sw2363B-ms98-a-0050 203.968250 210.259875 well in most cases i'd have to agree with you i think the uh profit sharing is a little uh [laughter]
sw2363B-ms98-a-0051 210.259875 211.997000 a little lacking right now
sw2363B-ms98-a-0052 211.997000 214.118500 and for the past few years
sw2363B-ms98-a-0053 214.118500 218.110875 but like they always say you know got a good profit sharing plan just no profit

sw2363B-ms98-a-0084 285.855375 289.189500 you know where you enter your own n[umber]- ID number
sw2363B-ms98-a-0085 289.189500 297.427500 the logical thing would have been had to go had it go to the the employee number so that's the one you're going to do the next action on the change you know
sw2363B-ms98-a-0086 297.427500 299.762250 and there's a lot of little things like that in there
