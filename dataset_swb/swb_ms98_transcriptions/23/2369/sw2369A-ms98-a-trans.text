sw2369A-ms98-a-0011 27.938875 40.043125 i guess i grew up uh camping my folks were big campers from day one as far as i can remember we grew up in southern Oklahoma and they were uh we were always hit Texoma or
sw2369A-ms98-a-0012 40.043125 43.860000 some camping area all of either Texas or Oklahoma
sw2369A-ms98-a-0013 43.860000 52.230125 and i was involved in Boy Scouts as a young kid and we were camping uh seem like every other weekend we would go somewhere
sw2369A-ms98-a-0014 52.230125 59.881000 i when they talk about the definitions of camping it kind of struck me as funny my brother and sister-in-law
sw2369A-ms98-a-0015 59.881000 68.734375 who live in Arlington and go camping uh a lot during the spring and summer and fall but their idea of camping is a little bit different than mine they have a fifth wheel trailer that they pull
sw2369A-ms98-a-0016 68.734375 75.936000 that has uh you know two bedrooms a TV and microwave and stove and all that kind of stuff and he pulls it with a big pickup 
sw2369A-ms98-a-0017 75.936000 81.048250 when i when i when i go camping i usually take a sleeping bag and some cooking stuff and that's about it
sw2369A-ms98-a-0018 81.048250 83.022000 [silence]
sw2369A-ms98-a-0019 83.022000 89.786625 well it's not like leaving home when you take it with you the whole idea is to get away from it
sw2369A-ms98-a-0020 89.786625 96.028750 [silence]
sw2369A-ms98-a-0021 96.028750 101.469250 i have been and uh some of the boy scouts have been up in there they have got some great hiking trails and camping areas up in there

sw2369A-ms98-a-0034 142.812750 151.158250 they ha[ve]- i have heard they since changed name of the park to something else but it was one of those parks with a uh a natural 
sw2369A-ms98-a-0035 151.158250 162.521375 uh spring fed river that flows through the camp sites you know all along the river the water was real cold because it was spring fed but just like i say it's a beautiful area lots of hills to go camping in
sw2369A-ms98-a-0036 162.521375 171.319000 uh dad never believed in tent camping uh we had some old army cots that we would sleep on uh uh come 
sw2369A-ms98-a-0037 171.319000 179.525375 good weather or not a many of times we were sleeping out under the stars and it would start raining and we would all wind up in the car and that got pretty cramped sometimes
sw2369A-ms98-a-0038 179.525375 187.015625 a lot of good memories in in in camping you know it helps you unwind and get away and forget [vocalized-noise] TI and everything else back home i guess
