sw2369B-ms98-a-0095 453.951625 459.650500 yeah i'll tell you i i would recommend too Texoma is nice because there is no many places you can ski there
sw2369B-ms98-a-0096 459.650500 463.487500 and uh in the Texans area has got two nice launching ramps 
sw2369B-ms98-a-0097 463.487500 473.596125 one of them is in a protected cove and the other one is okay if the lake is calm it's out more in the open uh the other place that i would really strongly recommend is Possum Kingdom
sw2369B-ms98-a-0098 473.596125 474.818625 [silence]
sw2369B-ms98-a-0099 474.818625 477.542250 and that is absolutely the prettiest that
sw2369B-ms98-a-0100 477.542250 490.994625 when i learned to slalom ski it was the only place i didn't mind swallowing and boy i swallowed a lot a lot of water learning and the only place i didn't mind swallowing half the lake and i didn't feel grungy about it like i did at Lavon
sw2369B-ms98-a-0101 490.994625 502.580125 ah no it's not over crowded it's uh it it far enough away so it's not over crowded and it's surrounded by cliffs so no matter how much wind it is there is always a big portion of the lake that's calm
sw2369B-ms98-a-0102 502.580125 503.841875 [silence]
sw2369B-ms98-a-0103 503.841875 506.593125 yeah its too open
sw2369B-ms98-a-0104 506.593125 519.597750 yeah and there's uh they have got some forty to fifty foot high cliffs around Possum Kingdom and you just get up and ski uh adjacent to those and uh and it doesn't make any difference how windy it is you don't notice it
sw2369B-ms98-a-0105 519.597750 521.489375 [silence]
