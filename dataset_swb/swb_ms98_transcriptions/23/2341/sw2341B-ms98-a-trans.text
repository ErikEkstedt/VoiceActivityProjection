sw2341B-ms98-a-0002 12.926250 18.980000 i think i think we're always convinced that we're paying too much in taxes
sw2341B-ms98-a-0003 18.980000 24.769000 without getting back necessarily everything we'd like to but so far
sw2341B-ms98-a-0004 24.769000 29.494625 i don't think i've paid enough taxes to be too too awfully concerned about it yet
sw2341B-ms98-a-0005 29.494625 48.359250 [silence]
sw2341B-ms98-a-0006 48.359250 49.676750 yes
sw2341B-ms98-a-0007 49.676750 56.003250 [silence]
sw2341B-ms98-a-0008 56.003250 57.192375 right
sw2341B-ms98-a-0009 57.192375 87.010125 [silence]
sw2341B-ms98-a-0010 87.010125 88.092000 right
sw2341B-ms98-a-0011 88.092000 90.960000 [silence]
sw2341B-ms98-a-0012 90.960000 93.290250 do you all pay state income tax
sw2341B-ms98-a-0013 93.290250 96.618500 [silence]
sw2341B-ms98-a-0014 96.618500 103.835625 neither do we and and and i agree with the yet part they've just started talking about introducing a state income tax
sw2341B-ms98-a-0015 103.835625 110.867500 and right now we pay an extremely high state uh sales tax almost eight percent
sw2341B-ms98-a-0016 110.867500 119.256375 [silence]
sw2341B-ms98-a-0017 119.256375 120.451000 wow
sw2341B-ms98-a-0018 120.451000 127.988000 [silence]
sw2341B-ms98-a-0019 127.988000 129.070125 right
sw2341B-ms98-a-0020 129.070125 145.018375 [silence]
sw2341B-ms98-a-0021 145.018375 146.226750 well that's good
sw2341B-ms98-a-0022 146.226750 165.728500 [silence]
sw2341B-ms98-a-0023 165.728500 174.153500 that's i think that's the biggest problem i have with the tax system is there there is such a disparity between between really the haves and the have nots
sw2341B-ms98-a-0024 174.153500 184.393250 and i- i think the things that they use as a basis for distributing back the tax dollars needs to be looked at again
sw2341B-ms98-a-0025 184.393250 195.876000 [silence]
sw2341B-ms98-a-0026 195.876000 203.050000 i know that would be a a definite B V R M I R [laughter]
sw2341B-ms98-a-0027 203.050000 221.566750 [silence]
sw2341B-ms98-a-0028 221.566750 229.965250 i think a lot a lot of times it seems like the classic can't see the forest for the trees i- i wonder if if they realize
sw2341B-ms98-a-0029 229.965250 235.038000 the the magnitude of some of the red tape you have to go through
sw2341B-ms98-a-0030 235.038000 268.218875 [silence]
sw2341B-ms98-a-0031 268.218875 276.067250 and i don't i don't think they're getting their money's worth and i- i- i definitely don't think that the added
sw2341B-ms98-a-0032 276.067250 277.246500 [silence]
sw2341B-ms98-a-0033 277.246500 286.111750 steps are are getting the benefit that they would like them to i think it's just causing most everyone else more problems because if somebody wants to get around the tax laws
sw2341B-ms98-a-0034 286.111750 287.859625 they will find a way
sw2341B-ms98-a-0035 287.859625 293.762375 if they want to badly enough they'll either find it themselves or they'll find someone to do it for them
sw2341B-ms98-a-0036 293.762375 353.927500 [silence]
sw2341B-ms98-a-0037 353.927500 355.297000 right

sw2341B-ms98-a-0040 371.086625 380.331750 [silence]
sw2341B-ms98-a-0041 380.331750 388.507250 and that makes sense but like you said i mean it it seems simple and i think in a way it's so simple that people would be afraid to try it
sw2341B-ms98-a-0042 388.507250 402.013875 [silence]
sw2341B-ms98-a-0043 402.013875 402.978250 yeah
sw2341B-ms98-a-0044 402.978250 412.643125 [silence]
sw2341B-ms98-a-0045 412.643125 418.440875 yeah even if you didn't invest in necessarily the the best thing you would have so much more to invest
sw2341B-ms98-a-0046 418.440875 420.949625 yo[u]- you'd still be ahead
sw2341B-ms98-a-0047 420.949625 422.248750 [silence]
sw2341B-ms98-a-0048 422.248750 427.814625 and that's something that's something i need t[o]- to learn a lot more about is is
sw2341B-ms98-a-0049 427.814625 432.810125 under the current structure what is the best thing to be investing in for the future
sw2341B-ms98-a-0050 432.810125 438.273625 because that's a that's a scary thought you always hear that Social Security won't be around by the time
sw2341B-ms98-a-0051 438.273625 443.926375 we're sixty three or sixty five and and need it and that's a scary thought
sw2341B-ms98-a-0052 443.926375 448.924000 [silence]
sw2341B-ms98-a-0053 448.924000 449.964125 no
