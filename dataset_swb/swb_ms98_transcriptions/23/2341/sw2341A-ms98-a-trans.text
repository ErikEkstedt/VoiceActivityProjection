sw2341A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 4.689750 the taxes tend to uh keep going up but
sw2341A-ms98-a-0002 4.689750 12.884375 uh i don't know if it helps me any to look at some of the other countries and say well there's always someone that's [noise] that's worse off in what they end up paying
sw2341A-ms98-a-0003 12.884375 15.194500 but uh go ahead
sw2341A-ms98-a-0004 15.194500 29.527875 [silence]
sw2341A-ms98-a-0005 29.527875 32.819250 yeah i'm still still i'm able to survive and
sw2341A-ms98-a-0006 32.819250 44.145125 and uh working for a company that reaps some benefits from the tax money it's almost like you're paying your own salary i don't work directly for the government but uh getting government contracts and
sw2341A-ms98-a-0007 44.145125 50.258375 being in the defense industry as it were even realize a little slim these days it's still uh
sw2341A-ms98-a-0008 50.258375 56.435500 still a feeling of you know it's not totally wasted dollars if you think about it some of it coming back your way
sw2341A-ms98-a-0009 56.435500 63.471875 uh that helps the rationale any but it's still angering to see the abuses uh even though they're uh
sw2341A-ms98-a-0010 63.471875 72.113750 a relatively small percentage they still they sound humongous when they're you know you hear millions and sometimes billions of dollars spent and
sw2341A-ms98-a-0011 72.113750 81.801375 and even some of the arguments over the national endowment for the arts and what's happening in that area it's still a pretty small chunk considering what actually flows through that government
sw2341A-ms98-a-0012 81.801375 82.820250 [silence]
sw2341A-ms98-a-0013 82.820250 86.995125 so but those are the things that get us going or get us stirred up sometimes
sw2341A-ms98-a-0014 86.995125 88.013750 people
sw2341A-ms98-a-0015 88.013750 91.034250 desire that that money not be spent well
sw2341A-ms98-a-0016 91.034250 93.171250 [silence]
sw2341A-ms98-a-0017 93.171250 97.587375 no no Texas doesn't have a state income tax yet that's
sw2341A-ms98-a-0018 97.587375 111.020250 [silence]
sw2341A-ms98-a-0019 111.020250 119.741875 well by the time the city gets involved i'm not sure how many how many people have their hand in it but we pay eight and a quarter cent
sw2341A-ms98-a-0020 119.741875 128.441375 so it's it's pretty pretty much but i think it's divvied up pretty much too uh the county gets some the city gets some and the state gets some
sw2341A-ms98-a-0021 128.441375 129.498750 [silence]
sw2341A-ms98-a-0022 129.498750 136.553625 and it's it's quite a bit i think six something is the state and and uh the rest of the pie goes elsewhere
sw2341A-ms98-a-0023 136.553625 145.748125 but we're in a particular part of the state that's pretty well off so it's it's like we get a lot of that back as far as local taxation goes
sw2341A-ms98-a-0024 145.748125 154.698875 yeah we have a real good you know police department and real good uh city services and boy the parks are all over the place and there's a lot of
sw2341A-ms98-a-0025 154.698875 162.833625 lot of money spent on us but uh the poor rural folks uh barely can get ambulance service and everything else so it's
sw2341A-ms98-a-0026 162.833625 165.863250 it's a real mixed blessing i guess to
sw2341A-ms98-a-0027 165.863250 184.474125 [silence]
sw2341A-ms98-a-0028 184.474125 187.413500 yeah it'd be nice if you could find someone
sw2341A-ms98-a-0029 187.413500 189.143000 oh
sw2341A-ms98-a-0030 189.143000 196.666125 uninfluenced by groups and and honest enough to find a way that would go over and then you'd have to find a way to make it work [laughter]
sw2341A-ms98-a-0031 196.666125 201.227625 [silence]
sw2341A-ms98-a-0032 201.227625 203.095625 yeah yeah
sw2341A-ms98-a-0033 203.095625 207.410250 the uh bureaucracy seems to spend
sw2341A-ms98-a-0034 207.410250 214.331625 more money just trying to administer some of these programs than the programs are worth uh it seems uh
sw2341A-ms98-a-0035 214.331625 221.588000 an awful waste of time to have so many people having to fill out so much paper just to get rid of so few dollars in some of these cases
sw2341A-ms98-a-0036 221.588000 223.014875 so it make
sw2341A-ms98-a-0037 223.014875 235.550375 [silence]
sw2341A-ms98-a-0038 235.550375 236.795125 yeah
sw2341A-ms98-a-0039 236.795125 241.285750 and so much of that red tape was was initially and is added on
sw2341A-ms98-a-0040 241.285750 252.625750 to try and stop a given abuse you know you discover a particular problem and say well we ought to run this extra check and we'll have to file these extra papers to say well you you deserve this welfare or whatever
sw2341A-ms98-a-0041 252.625750 255.787875 and they just keep trying to to
sw2341A-ms98-a-0042 255.787875 263.048375 close all the loopholes and stop the abuse and all they're doing is making it worse and having to add more staff and
sw2341A-ms98-a-0043 263.048375 268.451750 and uh decreasing the efficiency of those who are actually trying to stop the abuse
sw2341A-ms98-a-0044 268.451750 287.636250 [silence]
sw2341A-ms98-a-0045 287.636250 288.655125 um-hum
sw2341A-ms98-a-0046 288.655125 293.408625 [silence]
sw2341A-ms98-a-0047 293.408625 294.865375 right
sw2341A-ms98-a-0048 294.865375 297.144500 it does seem to be the case
sw2341A-ms98-a-0049 297.144500 302.501750 i don't know whether it's worth and the economy has gone pretty well for a
sw2341A-ms98-a-0050 302.501750 310.337125 hundred years or so with the government doing what they do with taxes steering investments and steering virtually every
sw2341A-ms98-a-0051 310.337125 313.573625 dollar you make or spend it gets uh
sw2341A-ms98-a-0052 313.573625 322.872250 steered one way or the other based on tax breaks you get and you know housing had tax breaks for a while and then they slacked off on that for a while and then
sw2341A-ms98-a-0053 322.872250 331.717750 just uh generally wanting to be in control of of where everything's going for the most part give you the best break if you go their direction
sw2341A-ms98-a-0054 331.717750 334.892875 i don't know what what would happen if we
sw2341A-ms98-a-0055 334.892875 344.248125 uh got rid of some of those controls and just went to what some people would say would be simpler of just having uh you spend this much
sw2341A-ms98-a-0056 344.248125 350.451000 uh therefore you should be taxed this much uh that would only encourage saving it's not a 
sw2341A-ms98-a-0057 350.451000 354.968500 you know a tax your income because now you're talking about having to report it and all that kind of stuff
sw2341A-ms98-a-0058 354.968500 356.982875 but if you put the burden on
sw2341A-ms98-a-0059 356.982875 364.042375 the retailer who really doesn't care if you you know buy your groceries and the like he doesn't care who bought the groceries you're going to pay the tax on it
sw2341A-ms98-a-0060 364.042375 370.118625 so [vocalized-noise] most people tend to spend what they make anyway in in our in[come]- income brackets
sw2341A-ms98-a-0061 370.118625 374.716375 so you know those fifty thousand dollars or the thirty thousand dollars would
sw2341A-ms98-a-0062 374.716375 380.351625 pretty much spend the majority of it and what they didn't save they wouldn't have to get or what they cou[ld]- could save they wouldn't get taxed on 
sw2341A-ms98-a-0063 380.351625 387.975250 [silence]
sw2341A-ms98-a-0064 387.975250 391.247375 yeah but you wouldn't be able to steer people toward
sw2341A-ms98-a-0065 391.247375 396.624625 a particular type of savings you wouldn't be able to say well you get better tax bonds if you you know
sw2341A-ms98-a-0066 396.624625 402.308375 avoid the capital gains tax and if you do it this way do this and you roll over your IRA's and all that they
sw2341A-ms98-a-0067 402.308375 407.368375 you wouldn't be able to steer people toward retirement and all that but boy if you save that much money
sw2341A-ms98-a-0068 407.368375 410.992625 and it didn't have the taxation problem well you might
sw2341A-ms98-a-0069 410.992625 413.691000 might do all right i don't know it seems
sw2341A-ms98-a-0070 413.691000 418.550000 [silence]
sw2341A-ms98-a-0071 418.550000 419.597750 yeah
sw2341A-ms98-a-0072 419.597750 420.622250 [silence]
sw2341A-ms98-a-0073 420.622250 422.069250 that's for sure
sw2341A-ms98-a-0074 422.069250 442.032875 [silence]
sw2341A-ms98-a-0075 442.032875 443.035250 right
sw2341A-ms98-a-0076 443.035250 444.039875 [silence]
sw2341A-ms98-a-0077 444.039875 450.109500 that's true plus what what there will be of it even if it's there isn't quite enough anyway [laughter-so]
sw2341A-ms98-a-0078 450.109500 455.018750 you're looking at having to do it on your own for the most part and then hope what you did didn't go away
sw2341A-ms98-a-0079 455.018750 457.045500 yeah the uh
sw2341A-ms98-a-0080 457.045500 459.628375 the taxes are are
sw2341A-ms98-a-0081 459.628375 468.315625 kind of messed up i guess with the abuses and the things we've written into it but uh loo[king]- looking at some of the other countries and some of the other options you have in the world there
sw2341A-ms98-a-0082 468.315625 471.014875 it's not all that pleasant anywhere
sw2341A-ms98-a-0083 471.014875 472.490125 [noise]
sw2341A-ms98-a-0084 472.490125 474.335375 yeah pretty much
sw2341A-ms98-a-0085 474.335375 480.703500 well i hear one of my {kiddos} doing something they shouldn't be so i'll uh let you go and may[be]-
sw2341A-ms98-a-0086 480.703500 482.680625 m[aybe]- maybe we'll catch each other again
sw2341A-ms98-a-0087 482.680625 483.685875 [silence]
sw2341A-ms98-a-0088 483.685875 485.131375 i'll try bye
sw2341A-ms98-a-0089 485.131375 486.603625 [noise]
