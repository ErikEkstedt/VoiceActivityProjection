sw2388A-ms98-a-0012 34.944375 47.748875 well i think [noise] i think my best part actually is chipping or at least it was last year i haven't been out this year it's kind of been uh kind of strange i hadn't been able to get out yet but uh my biggest problem is staying in the fairway
sw2388A-ms98-a-0013 47.748875 48.307500 [laughter]
sw2388A-ms98-a-0014 48.307500 51.028125 for you know with drives and stuff um

sw2388A-ms98-a-0018 57.072125 64.150125 yeah i've i've gone in the past years from uh having a wicked slice to having a wicked hook to back to having a wicked slice i mean it's just uh
sw2388A-ms98-a-0019 64.150125 74.669000 and i can't seem to find the middle space you know but i've i've got a friend of mine working on it uh i've trying to help me out i've been going to the driving range with him and and it seems to be doing some um
sw2388A-ms98-a-0020 74.669000 77.517375 [silence]
sw2388A-ms98-a-0021 77.517375 91.832125 yeah well lessons are are okay if you do it right i think i did i took some lessons uh a couple of years back but to tell you the truth that [vocalized-noise] for a while hurt more than it helped um because i i and it turned out that i couldn't do anything right after that
sw2388A-ms98-a-0022 91.832125 93.442125 um
sw2388A-ms98-a-0023 93.442125 106.958625 even you know like i said my chipping which is one of the best things in my game i couldn't do that i couldn't couldn't drive couldn't you know in in fact it was it wasn't as much at that point that i was hooking and slicing i just i was topping the ball i was
sw2388A-ms98-a-0024 106.958625 114.500875 you know i was doing a lot of things wrong at that point but i was trying to think of so many different things at the same time because_1 you know it was [laughter]
sw2388A-ms98-a-0025 114.500875 118.551375 it it's kind of a funny story whenever i went f[or]- for my first lesson
sw2388A-ms98-a-0026 118.551375 128.941625 the uh the instructor takes me out there and he says all right well take a swing and let me see how you look so he's he's bending down on one knee right so i take a swing and and all of a sudden his head just goes down
sw2388A-ms98-a-0027 128.941625 137.465250 and and then all of a you know he just kind of slowly brings his head up and looks at me and he says we've got a lot of work to do [laughter] [laughter-so]
sw2388A-ms98-a-0028 137.465250 146.658875 oh yeah i was [laughter] [laughter-feeling] real good then [laughter-so] so he broke me down from i mean he started me from the very beginning as far as changing just about everything i did and uh
sw2388A-ms98-a-0029 146.658875 147.939875 uh
sw2388A-ms98-a-0030 147.939875 149.089125 [noise]

sw2388A-ms98-a-0035 155.071500 164.848750 ah oh that's definitely true in fact if uh if i ever you know have a son or anything i'm definitely going to uh you know [noise] teaching have a have a lesson or something is that yours or mine
sw2388A-ms98-a-0036 164.848750 166.459750 [silence]

sw2388A-ms98-a-0042 186.844375 188.311125 what's that
sw2388A-ms98-a-0043 188.311125 193.808125 [silence]
sw2388A-ms98-a-0044 193.808125 195.386250 oh yeah
sw2388A-ms98-a-0045 195.386250 204.364750 well uh you know the only person i've ever known that had a hole in one was my brother-in-law but uh and he he said he got his luckily so i don't know that's that's but i mean
sw2388A-ms98-a-0046 204.364750 207.277750 [silence]
sw2388A-ms98-a-0047 207.277750 219.648375 i came so close once just once i mean that's the only time i've ever been any anywhere near but i mean i [vocalized-noise] was uh [vocalized-noise] i used to live out in Midland Texas i don't know if you've ever been out there but it's you know a real windy place
sw2388A-ms98-a-0048 219.648375 222.274500 [laughter] but uh
sw2388A-ms98-a-0049 222.274500 233.434500 yeah i- i played on a course out there and like i said it's a very windy place so it's you know the wind was blowing and it was cold and it was like it was about a hundred and i don't know a hundred and seventy or a hundred and eighty year par three
sw2388A-ms98-a-0050 233.434500 247.625125 and i you know the wind was right in my face so i just pulled out a seven wood right and i put that thing i mean it rolled right by the cup and only ended up three inches off but you know over over past the hole but i mean that's as close as i've ever been you know
sw2388A-ms98-a-0051 247.625125 256.607000 because_1 i'm not you know that's one of my problems is uh is controlling my my uh my irons on a par three so i have a lot of trouble hitting the greens
sw2388A-ms98-a-0052 256.607000 260.033000 so do you do you like watching it though i mean
sw2388A-ms98-a-0053 260.033000 273.058875 [silence]
sw2388A-ms98-a-0054 273.058875 281.368125 yeah well that's that's exactly what my friend has has figured out that i do is my i can actually see the club on my backswing and and uh
sw2388A-ms98-a-0055 281.368125 289.115750 and he says that what i do is i'm actually crossing the plain is what this is his words his technical words for it crossing yeah
sw2388A-ms98-a-0056 289.115750 296.127250 yeah because_1 i[t]- because_1 i ended up into an inverted C where the uh the weight was on the wrong foot or something so
sw2388A-ms98-a-0057 296.127250 303.113750 i i've found that i actually do of uh i get a lot uh better control and distance if i don't you know don't take as big a back swing
sw2388A-ms98-a-0058 303.113750 307.728375 [silence]
sw2388A-ms98-a-0059 307.728375 316.927500 yeah what's funny is the idea that uh you know what i consider you know like a three-quarter backswing or even a half backswing
sw2388A-ms98-a-0060 316.927500 326.026375 uh my friend says that's you know that's a full backswing and you don't want to go any further than that so i mean it's a now it's a matter of trying to convince myself that that's right [laughter]
sw2388A-ms98-a-0061 326.026375 328.853125 [laughter-so] i don't know it's going to be interesting
sw2388A-ms98-a-0062 328.853125 332.026375 um that's probably true
sw2388A-ms98-a-0063 332.026375 333.771625 well
sw2388A-ms98-a-0064 333.771625 339.425125 oh isn't it though i don't know why i do it [laughter]
sw2388A-ms98-a-0065 339.425125 345.149875 oh [vocalized-noise] that's that's one of the worse things about it it really is but uh [noise]
sw2388A-ms98-a-0066 345.149875 346.502250 you know

sw2388A-ms98-a-0071 360.298375 364.152125 you know that's it you have to be healthy too that's another point i guess
sw2388A-ms98-a-0072 364.152125 366.478375 [noise] well i think that's about it
sw2388A-ms98-a-0073 366.478375 367.774375 [silence]
sw2388A-ms98-a-0074 367.774375 369.446875 yeah i do too
