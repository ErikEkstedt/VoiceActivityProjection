sw2348A-ms98-a-0006 21.459125 37.050625 [silence]
sw2348A-ms98-a-0007 37.050625 47.318250 yeah how about how about uh long term do you have anything uh for as far as as far as savings go for long term
sw2348A-ms98-a-0008 47.318250 61.199375 [silence]
sw2348A-ms98-a-0009 61.199375 63.853875 uh yeah
sw2348A-ms98-a-0010 63.853875 69.920000 okay that's uh uh we used to budget when the children were small
sw2348A-ms98-a-0011 69.920000 71.826625 um
sw2348A-ms98-a-0012 71.826625 76.417875 things were and there was only one income so we had to watch what we were doing
sw2348A-ms98-a-0013 76.417875 85.174625 and our savings weren't that great but now the kids are all grown up and gone in fact the youngest is is uh
sw2348A-ms98-a-0014 85.174625 88.418625 finally getting out of college this uh May
sw2348A-ms98-a-0015 88.418625 102.320125 so we've we don't budget anymore we run basically the same as you do you kind of know what you're going to spend uh week to week or or you have your monthly bills at a fixed
sw2348A-ms98-a-0016 102.320125 106.259375 um as far as electricity and telephone and 
sw2348A-ms98-a-0017 106.259375 113.912250 um we do the same thing we budget not budget but um i have a long term savings goal
sw2348A-ms98-a-0018 113.912250 116.991750 for retirement you know
sw2348A-ms98-a-0019 116.991750 120.217750 they take out for CODA and then uh um
sw2348A-ms98-a-0020 120.217750 122.270375 the IRA's
sw2348A-ms98-a-0021 122.270375 126.055500 and then uh i also take out for
sw2348A-ms98-a-0022 126.055500 131.059375 um a savings account but it's it's uh
sw2348A-ms98-a-0023 131.059375 132.594500 [noise]
sw2348A-ms98-a-0024 132.594500 137.973750 um it's not really sa[vings]- it's savings if we don't spend it
sw2348A-ms98-a-0025 137.973750 139.041750 [silence]
sw2348A-ms98-a-0026 139.041750 143.135500 it's like a floating you know if something if something comes up
sw2348A-ms98-a-0027 143.135500 145.106000 [silence]
sw2348A-ms98-a-0028 145.106000 146.389875 yes
sw2348A-ms98-a-0029 146.389875 147.878875 [silence]
sw2348A-ms98-a-0030 147.878875 149.634250 right yeah
sw2348A-ms98-a-0031 149.634250 150.831625 it it
sw2348A-ms98-a-0032 150.831625 153.492750 it doesn't come out um
sw2348A-ms98-a-0033 153.492750 164.537125 it doesn't come out of long term savings like we were we were um saving savings bonds too for oh years and years and years and now i'm getting up towards retirement age so
sw2348A-ms98-a-0034 164.537125 172.287250 we stopped stopped the the savings bonds and we're going {maxed} out on CODA and then
sw2348A-ms98-a-0035 172.287250 175.091000 you know other things like you know CD's
sw2348A-ms98-a-0036 175.091000 176.576750 um
sw2348A-ms98-a-0037 176.576750 185.605000 but this other it's in the credit union and they and they take it out and it goes in there and at the end of the month but if we want to go on a trip or if something looks good or if we want to go away for a weekend
sw2348A-ms98-a-0038 185.605000 187.124375 that's what we hit
sw2348A-ms98-a-0039 187.124375 188.126500 [silence]
sw2348A-ms98-a-0040 188.126500 191.916375 or if we go out for dinner say to a nice restaurant
sw2348A-ms98-a-0041 191.916375 194.748750 um that'll come out of that
sw2348A-ms98-a-0042 194.748750 196.807125 rather than put it on a credit card
sw2348A-ms98-a-0043 196.807125 208.439375 [silence]
sw2348A-ms98-a-0044 208.439375 209.659875 right
sw2348A-ms98-a-0045 209.659875 215.177750 [silence]
sw2348A-ms98-a-0046 215.177750 226.303875 yeah so it you don't have to really dig into long term or or you know well you can't cash in a CD that's kind of ridiculous um
sw2348A-ms98-a-0047 226.303875 228.180625 [noise]
sw2348A-ms98-a-0048 228.180625 234.062000 [silence]
sw2348A-ms98-a-0049 234.062000 235.085000 yeah
sw2348A-ms98-a-0050 235.085000 242.465250 [silence]
sw2348A-ms98-a-0051 242.465250 250.075125 right the only time you know about it is when it comes due and they'll say you know well you've got to reinvest it back in this or that or whatever
sw2348A-ms98-a-0052 250.075125 253.287875 but yeah it's it's it's kind of forced on you
sw2348A-ms98-a-0053 253.287875 255.778750 because you suffer a penalty
sw2348A-ms98-a-0054 255.778750 262.908250 so that's yeah that's one of the that's one of the ways that we do it you you also have uh CODA
sw2348A-ms98-a-0055 262.908250 264.635250 so
sw2348A-ms98-a-0056 264.635250 267.059625 [silence]
sw2348A-ms98-a-0057 267.059625 270.755000 that's yeah where else can you get that kind of interest to start with
sw2348A-ms98-a-0058 270.755000 272.554250 i mean that's fantastic
sw2348A-ms98-a-0059 272.554250 275.311125 you know they match it um
sw2348A-ms98-a-0060 275.311125 284.859375 my wife used to they matched hers only hers was a little bit better than ours um she hasn't been working for a couple of years her father took sick so she's been taking care of him
sw2348A-ms98-a-0061 284.859375 285.861625 [silence]
sw2348A-ms98-a-0062 285.861625 294.476125 but that added up too i mean when when she left and the pay out came in you know if we just rolled that over and it just sits there and gathers
sw2348A-ms98-a-0063 294.476125 298.878500 steam or momentum and you don't realize it you know it just
sw2348A-ms98-a-0064 298.878500 300.560750 piles up
sw2348A-ms98-a-0065 300.560750 308.928250 [silence]
sw2348A-ms98-a-0066 308.928250 313.309750 um yeah we we took out actually my wife
sw2348A-ms98-a-0067 313.309750 326.257875 she's the one that ran the budget you know i just brought it home and she had to stretch it out wherever it was going to go but she would allocate so much at at at that time when the kids were growing up [noise] so much went for groceries
sw2348A-ms98-a-0068 326.257875 327.491625 [noise]
sw2348A-ms98-a-0069 327.491625 338.694000 so much went for the mortgage because_1 we knew you know that was kind of fixed and electricity you could come pretty close and telephone you could come pretty close uh the oil
sw2348A-ms98-a-0070 338.694000 341.387000 we heated with oil [noise]
sw2348A-ms98-a-0071 341.387000 347.880375 we they put us on a budget they would run like uh [vocalized-noise] they could really tell how much oil you were going to use
sw2348A-ms98-a-0072 347.880375 350.903250 so they budgeted it at year round
sw2348A-ms98-a-0073 350.903250 353.103125 so in the summer time
sw2348A-ms98-a-0074 353.103125 355.723875 which you didn't use very little oil
sw2348A-ms98-a-0075 355.723875 361.512000 you were still paying the same thing as in the winter time when you're using a lot but they kind of spread the payments out
sw2348A-ms98-a-0076 361.512000 363.229000 and
sw2348A-ms98-a-0077 363.229000 370.376875 we stuck to that pretty much so uh groceries fluctuated um we didn't go out to eat that often
sw2348A-ms98-a-0078 370.376875 379.305625 but as times went on the children got older you know and naturally salaries increased um we kind of fell away from it
sw2348A-ms98-a-0079 379.305625 381.091375 it it became a chore
sw2348A-ms98-a-0080 381.091375 384.826250 [silence]
sw2348A-ms98-a-0081 384.826250 387.201625 yeah i talked to to uh
sw2348A-ms98-a-0082 387.201625 387.962875 [noise]
sw2348A-ms98-a-0083 387.962875 396.599625 other people and they used to have envelopes they used to stuff so much in you know so much for this so much for that so much for we never really we never really did that
sw2348A-ms98-a-0084 396.599625 399.779375 we just allocated so much and it went into a checking account
sw2348A-ms98-a-0085 399.779375 404.466375 and at the end of the month hopefully everything came out pretty close
sw2348A-ms98-a-0086 404.466375 409.460750 so we just kept certain things out for like i said for groceries
sw2348A-ms98-a-0087 409.460750 416.327375 um but even at that point you know she'd say oh you know we we need this or the budget's not doing this or that uh
sw2348A-ms98-a-0088 416.327375 421.578750 course me i didn't run it like she ran it like you run it now
sw2348A-ms98-a-0089 421.578750 422.585125 [silence]
sw2348A-ms98-a-0090 422.585125 426.431000 and it's pretty much the same she still does the same thing everything's fixed
sw2348A-ms98-a-0091 426.431000 430.344625 you know like CODA comes out of your out of your pay and the credit union comes out of your pay
sw2348A-ms98-a-0092 430.344625 433.422000 so we don't have to do anything there and the rest of it
sw2348A-ms98-a-0093 433.422000 439.889625 as far as my salary goes i just have it automatically deposited in into our bank
sw2348A-ms98-a-0094 439.889625 440.887625 [silence]
sw2348A-ms98-a-0095 440.887625 449.606125 so we don't really see anything if if i need something i'll go and you know use the teller machine or if she needs something she'll go and she'll use the teller machine
sw2348A-ms98-a-0096 449.606125 454.356875 so we don't really um have a lot of cash anymore
sw2348A-ms98-a-0097 454.356875 460.227250 yeah i i walk around sometimes and i've got if i've got five dollars in my pocket that's that's a lot it's
sw2348A-ms98-a-0098 460.227250 469.158125 [silence]
sw2348A-ms98-a-0099 469.158125 470.752125 yeah for your automobile
sw2348A-ms98-a-0100 470.752125 482.063625 you mean gas [vocalized-noise] yeah and now i don't know about down there but up here they got the pumps you just put your because_1 i always put my gas on a credit card and i pay it at the end of the month
sw2348A-ms98-a-0101 482.063625 487.655000 so you just stick your credit card in there and then it pumps whatever it pumps and it adds it all up and it gives you a ticket and off you go
sw2348A-ms98-a-0102 487.655000 490.405250 so you don't even have to go in to see the teller anymore
sw2348A-ms98-a-0103 490.405250 499.446500 yeah yeah it's not bad so you don't need you don't need money for gasoline you don't need money you know incidentals
sw2348A-ms98-a-0104 499.446500 500.650500 uh
sw2348A-ms98-a-0105 500.650500 504.925500 for coffee when i come into work in the morning and things like that but other than that
sw2348A-ms98-a-0106 504.925500 510.262500 um it looks like we're probably going towards a cashless society
sw2348A-ms98-a-0107 510.262500 511.992375 [silence]
sw2348A-ms98-a-0108 511.992375 514.317125 because if you're doing that
sw2348A-ms98-a-0109 514.317125 518.956750 you know and i'm sure it must be prevalent in your area down in Dallas
sw2348A-ms98-a-0110 518.956750 530.460000 um and we're doing it m[ost]- most of the people up here that work ha[ve]- already have their their checks uh electronically sent to their banks or the credit union if they belong to the credit union
sw2348A-ms98-a-0111 530.460000 532.003375 [silence]
sw2348A-ms98-a-0112 532.003375 534.640000 so they don't deal much in cash anymore either
sw2348A-ms98-a-0113 534.640000 538.946875 [silence]
sw2348A-ms98-a-0114 538.946875 542.172250 so it looks like we're both running about the same
sw2348A-ms98-a-0115 542.172250 543.602875 um
sw2348A-ms98-a-0116 543.602875 546.446125 maybe younger people are different i'm not sure
sw2348A-ms98-a-0117 546.446125 547.564750 uh
sw2348A-ms98-a-0118 547.564750 549.160000 [silence]
sw2348A-ms98-a-0119 549.160000 555.683375 they don't have spendable income right yeah the poor poor things i know like you know
sw2348A-ms98-a-0120 555.683375 561.254125 [vocalized-noise] i look at mine and he's getting out of school and i'm saying geez you know i'm glad i'm not starting out now because_1
sw2348A-ms98-a-0121 561.254125 566.034750 things are kind of tough up here for as far as uh employment goes
sw2348A-ms98-a-0122 566.034750 569.549375 [silence]
sw2348A-ms98-a-0123 569.549375 573.200250 still because_1 you guys ran into it a while back
sw2348A-ms98-a-0124 573.200250 574.076000 uh
sw2348A-ms98-a-0125 574.076000 579.772625 [silence]
sw2348A-ms98-a-0126 579.772625 592.299125 oh yeah it's not just yeah it's not just TI they they're doing the same thing up here and not just uh in yesterday's newspaper they said um IBM's going through they're going to lay off like fourteen thousand world wide
sw2348A-ms98-a-0127 592.299125 594.152625 [noise]
sw2348A-ms98-a-0128 594.152625 599.475875 So it's still there unfortunately um
