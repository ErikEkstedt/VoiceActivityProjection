sw2318B-ms98-a-0011 68.071000 71.234000 i'm sure that
sw2318B-ms98-a-0012 71.234000 79.309750 that that have to has happened but [noise] then there's also the um number of people who have
sw2318B-ms98-a-0013 79.309750 90.233000 created or committed murders etcetera that have not been put to death even though they were sentenced to death row like like look at Charles Manson i mean he just happened to have the right timing
sw2318B-ms98-a-0014 90.233000 90.864250 [noise]
sw2318B-ms98-a-0015 90.864250 97.883750 and yet [vocalized-noise] although he may never be free to kill again there are a lot of people like him that are free to kill again

sw2318B-ms98-a-0023 124.298000 130.242500 i don't think that i could sit on a jury and be part of sentencing someone to death
sw2318B-ms98-a-0024 130.242500 133.659875 i- i- i would find that too difficult

sw2318B-ms98-a-0034 181.018750 190.553250 i don't think it's a deterrent at all i don't think that anyone that uh commits a murder actually thinks that they will ever
sw2318B-ms98-a-0035 190.553250 195.971875 even uh be punished let alone put to death for it
sw2318B-ms98-a-0036 195.971875 205.031000 i mean look at the mentality [laughter] of your average person who smokes cigarettes they don't think they're ever going to get cancer and yet it's written on every single package
sw2318B-ms98-a-0037 205.031000 213.414875 most people who murder someone don't even get caught let alone prosecuted to the to the extent of the law

sw2318B-ms98-a-0041 233.658875 240.517250 right i think for probab[ly]- possibly the premeditated murders i think it's possibly a deterrent but
sw2318B-ms98-a-0042 240.517250 246.220125 for the for the gang violence the uh the street murders so to speak i don't think it is

sw2318B-ms98-a-0044 249.711000 254.891750 not where i live uh but i live outside of Dallas

sw2318B-ms98-a-0046 261.001875 270.295000 the San Antonio has much more gang violence than Dallas Dallas does have um an area of town however the
sw2318B-ms98-a-0047 270.295000 278.927875 young men i mean sixteen to nineteen year old boys [noise] are shot and killed or shot at least shot
sw2318B-ms98-a-0048 278.927875 284.253750 frequently the uh the county hospital that handles all the gunshot wounds here
sw2318B-ms98-a-0049 284.253750 287.296625 handles fifteen gunshot wounds a day

sw2318B-ms98-a-0072 446.316000 451.718500 yeah it's j[ust]- it's it's just a lack of concern they don't have you know these kids
sw2318B-ms98-a-0073 451.718500 462.235875 the ones that are involved in you know gangs i think are searching for self-esteem and they find something like that in uh their gang activities
sw2318B-ms98-a-0074 462.235875 468.664625 and they never had this at home and their parents don't have it if they happen to know their parents

sw2318B-ms98-a-0078 493.709750 507.056500 yeah the uh the we were shocked two mornings ago with uh the news that a forty year old man had sold his three year old son
sw2318B-ms98-a-0079 507.056500 510.264000 for forty dollars worth of crack
sw2318B-ms98-a-0080 510.264000 520.301000 and they found the boy and the boy had been unharmed but they were trying to sell him you know they were trying to sell the baby or the boy and he's three years old they were trying to sell him on the black market

sw2318B-ms98-a-0086 548.634500 553.570375 is the drugs are the drugs are going to get us all i mean drugs
sw2318B-ms98-a-0087 553.570375 563.561375 [laughter-actually] i think we're doing capital punishment to the wrong people i think we ought to have capital punishment for the true importers of drugs
sw2318B-ms98-a-0088 563.561375 574.016375 not the kids that are selling it on the street that don't know any better i'm talking about the people you know who are bringing it to our country i think they deserve capital punishment because they kill
sw2318B-ms98-a-0089 574.016375 576.075250 they kill a lot
