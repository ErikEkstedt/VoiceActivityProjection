sw2318A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.553750 [silence]
sw2318A-ms98-a-0002 0.553750 6.056375 yeah so it's got to be the most controversial thing if you could pick on the list
sw2318A-ms98-a-0003 6.056375 10.051000 oh we don't have capital punishment i believe you do
sw2318A-ms98-a-0004 10.051000 11.629250 oh
sw2318A-ms98-a-0005 11.629250 13.309375 [silence]
sw2318A-ms98-a-0006 13.309375 22.757750 yeah the the only thing about capital punishment is the i- i remember someone saying i think it was a chief justice in this state
sw2318A-ms98-a-0007 22.757750 32.985375 he goes if you make a mistake how do you get the person back that's the whole his whole basis was if you do have that error
sw2318A-ms98-a-0008 32.985375 44.641125 you know some people have been in jail for years and years and years and they're finally exonerated and then you know if if there if you killed the person and it's like oops too bad
sw2318A-ms98-a-0009 44.641125 53.686250 i mean i think i've heard of cases where someone did they uh the they were uh it was capital punishment they were killed
sw2318A-ms98-a-0010 53.686250 57.541125 and they found out years later that the he really didn't kill the person
sw2318A-ms98-a-0011 57.541125 68.619750 i believe there was one case i don't i don't know where i read it or anything but i think there there has to they have to have put innocent men or women to death before i mean
sw2318A-ms98-a-0012 68.619750 90.600500 [silence]
sw2318A-ms98-a-0013 90.600500 92.200250 yes [vocalized-noise]
sw2318A-ms98-a-0014 92.200250 95.821875 [silence]
sw2318A-ms98-a-0015 95.821875 96.988875 [vocalized-noise]
sw2318A-ms98-a-0016 96.988875 104.338125 i'm the type of person who sits you know it's the same thing about the war i'm this type person you you know you need it
sw2318A-ms98-a-0017 104.338125 111.539375 but you're the one who you can't you can't make the decision and go yes or no i'd be a terrible president because
sw2318A-ms98-a-0018 111.539375 124.891750 i would you know i knew we had to go to war and i knew you know it was the best thing but i didn't i would not want to be responsible for people getting hurt if you know if i don't know
sw2318A-ms98-a-0019 124.891750 130.226000 [silence]
sw2318A-ms98-a-0020 130.226000 132.569375 well uh like
sw2318A-ms98-a-0021 132.569375 142.331375 yes but like you say there there's people out there that do such terrible things w[ell]- i had one of the subjects was uh crime
sw2318A-ms98-a-0022 142.331375 151.112875 and it was talked about the the way society uh has worked out there's some people that economically trapped 
sw2318A-ms98-a-0023 151.112875 158.362625 and they really their parents don't bring them up properly they have absolutely no morals because_1 no one taught them
sw2318A-ms98-a-0024 158.362625 162.199625 i mean morals isn't something that's just in your heart and
sw2318A-ms98-a-0025 162.199625 164.451875 you're born with it you're
sw2318A-ms98-a-0026 164.451875 171.820875 it's something that's taught it's something on the streets that you see so if it's a dog eat dog world
sw2318A-ms98-a-0027 171.820875 176.699875 it it's just really too bad that we have to have something like capital punishment
sw2318A-ms98-a-0028 176.699875 177.754125 but
sw2318A-ms98-a-0029 177.754125 181.585875 i- i don't know how much of a deterrent it really is
sw2318A-ms98-a-0030 181.585875 182.603625 [silence]
sw2318A-ms98-a-0031 182.603625 184.965750 you don't think it's a deterrent
sw2318A-ms98-a-0032 184.965750 213.042625 [silence]
sw2318A-ms98-a-0033 213.042625 223.951625 so even though even though you don't think it's a deterrent which i have a tendency to -[a]gree agree i mean it's a deterrent it's it's the ones like carefully thinking it out and stuff
sw2318A-ms98-a-0034 223.951625 234.357375 they think about it but a lot of the street crime that goes on and stuff they don't really care and they don't really care what happens to them i can see where it's not a deterrent
sw2318A-ms98-a-0035 234.357375 240.081750 [silence]
sw2318A-ms98-a-0036 240.081750 241.671125 yes
sw2318A-ms98-a-0037 241.671125 245.406625 [silence]
sw2318A-ms98-a-0038 245.406625 250.365000 does it matter to you do you have a lot of violence where you live
sw2318A-ms98-a-0039 250.365000 252.109500 [silence]
sw2318A-ms98-a-0040 252.109500 254.053875 wh[ere]- where you work
sw2318A-ms98-a-0041 254.053875 262.173750 so is Dallas a bad city i talked to someone from San Antonio and and the Barrio she said it was very bad 
sw2318A-ms98-a-0042 262.173750 265.009125 [silence]
sw2318A-ms98-a-0043 265.009125 266.462750 Dallas

sw2318A-ms98-a-0045 283.575875 284.723000 yeah

sw2318A-ms98-a-0047 286.526125 288.495000 oh jeez
sw2318A-ms98-a-0048 288.495000 291.303625 and that's relatively calm city
sw2318A-ms98-a-0049 291.303625 293.056625 [laughter]
sw2318A-ms98-a-0050 293.056625 294.273875 [silence]
sw2318A-ms98-a-0051 294.273875 295.614250 yes
sw2318A-ms98-a-0052 295.614250 299.884750 [silence]
sw2318A-ms98-a-0053 299.884750 309.475625 oh it's very calm i mean you can [vocalized-noise] our uh bad district i wouldn't advise going walking in there alone at night but you could
sw2318A-ms98-a-0054 309.475625 317.192250 and if anyone was bothering you you could make such a fuss where people would come to your aid even though you're in the worst part of the city
sw2318A-ms98-a-0055 317.192250 327.892125 um the only difference is that every street light is lit instead of every other street light so we're we're a really we're uh pampered up here
sw2318A-ms98-a-0056 327.892125 340.144500 um and when they do have a crime a murder let's we had quite a few years ago a young two young men they were sixteen years old um
sw2318A-ms98-a-0057 340.144500 346.717375 raped and b[eat]- and beat these two twelve year old girls really bad it just shocked the whole state
sw2318A-ms98-a-0058 346.717375 352.598750 just how can anything happen like this and the guys that did it were so ignorant
sw2318A-ms98-a-0059 352.598750 358.410500 they didn't even re[morse]- they didn't they didn't have any remorse for what they were doing but they were just so ignorant
sw2318A-ms98-a-0060 358.410500 366.627750 that one of them says well i didn't realize that w[as]- because_1 i was beating her in the head that she was really going to die on me you know it's like
sw2318A-ms98-a-0061 366.627750 378.226625 although why did you do it she was screaming all i wanted to do was shut her up he he acted like he didn't even think that this was going to kill her i the kids were really quite ignorant about it and it
sw2318A-ms98-a-0062 378.226625 386.589750 it was a tragedy on both sides but it just shocked the uh the state that something like this could happen
sw2318A-ms98-a-0063 386.589750 392.647500 i mean usually if something if someone robs in the night or something
sw2318A-ms98-a-0064 392.647500 402.152625 and uh a home owner confronts him i mean it's not a blaze of guns and stuff you know the guy might hit the guy over the head and people start running
sw2318A-ms98-a-0065 402.152625 409.387875 i mean if this happened in the city the i'm sure the youth would be armed and just take the family out
sw2318A-ms98-a-0066 409.387875 412.958625 i mean we're really fortunate to live here but
sw2318A-ms98-a-0067 412.958625 418.887875 doing these conversations it makes me feel really bad that there are kids that
sw2318A-ms98-a-0068 418.887875 432.789750 can't can't get out of the situation they're in and they're they'll eventually end up even if they want to be good kids they'll eventually end up uh more or less victims of crimes even though they're doing the crimes they're more or less a victim
sw2318A-ms98-a-0069 432.789750 445.788000 [silence]
sw2318A-ms98-a-0070 445.788000 448.489875 yes it's it's really sad

sw2318A-ms98-a-0072 468.164125 475.923500 yes it's it's it's bad sometimes the kids have no choice because_1 the parents are are worse
sw2318A-ms98-a-0073 475.923500 486.827875 i mean it they'll do drugs in front of their kids they bring this boyfriends and girlfriends home in front of kids they they treat them like little slaves they holler at they hit them
sw2318A-ms98-a-0074 486.827875 494.837750 and they go they go to the gangs more or less for uh family oh this guys nice to me he doesn't hit me [laughter]

sw2318A-ms98-a-0079 522.618125 530.153625 [silence]
sw2318A-ms98-a-0080 530.153625 539.718625 we sit up here on our pedestals judging but we're not there but it's just it is totally unheard of that you you you even think it would happen
sw2318A-ms98-a-0081 539.718625 541.423500 oh j[eez]-
sw2318A-ms98-a-0082 541.423500 542.448375 [silence]

sw2318A-ms98-a-0088 575.197000 586.831625 well then they wouldn't do this for the drug kingpin that they were going to um institute the death penalty other or was it life in prison or whatever for the drug kingpins i don't
sw2318A-ms98-a-0089 586.831625 590.238500 it's it's so full of bullshit [laughter]
sw2318A-ms98-a-0090 590.238500 601.285250 the the drug war is just t[errible]- you can't trace it because a lot of the authorities are probably tied up into it i mean you know months ago it was the the military
