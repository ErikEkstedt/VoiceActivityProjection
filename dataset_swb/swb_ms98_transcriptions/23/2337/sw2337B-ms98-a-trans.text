sw2337B-ms98-a-0002 0.580875 3.132000 okay Brian i going to press number one and we'll go
sw2337B-ms98-a-0003 3.132000 4.237000 [silence]
sw2337B-ms98-a-0004 4.237000 5.136375 [noise]
sw2337B-ms98-a-0005 5.136375 6.156000 [silence]
sw2337B-ms98-a-0006 6.156000 16.577000 hey um uh Ronnie i think my first introduction to the metric system was in physics in college and i think prior to that i didn't even realize that another system existed
sw2337B-ms98-a-0007 16.577000 20.501000 uh but it makes so darn much sense to me
sw2337B-ms98-a-0008 20.501000 26.924875 over the English system i i i have a hard time understanding why people don't take to it
sw2337B-ms98-a-0009 26.924875 57.380750 [silence]
sw2337B-ms98-a-0010 57.380750 59.363000 yeah i understand
sw2337B-ms98-a-0011 59.363000 61.670250 [silence]
sw2337B-ms98-a-0012 61.670250 63.261500 no no
sw2337B-ms98-a-0013 63.261500 72.591625 [silence]
sw2337B-ms98-a-0014 72.591625 79.352500 yeah and i noticed that too in uh in uh uh metal stamp metal parts that we buy
sw2337B-ms98-a-0015 79.352500 83.121250 we at one time went back through and dual dual dimensioned them all
sw2337B-ms98-a-0016 83.121250 89.947625 and uh you know it's uh it's easy to put down point O O one inches or one mil
sw2337B-ms98-a-0017 89.947625 93.331875 uh it's kind of difficult to have its metric equivalent
sw2337B-ms98-a-0018 93.331875 101.114500 uh in in terms of the numbers that you've got to carry around i guess one of the things i i think metrically
sw2337B-ms98-a-0019 101.114500 110.346500 i've got a uh a and it drives my wife crazy you know she'll say how far is it from here to somewhere she wants to go and i'll say oh about eight kilometers
sw2337B-ms98-a-0020 110.346500 115.413125 and she'll look at me and give me this crazy look but my uh my my uh hobby is distance running
sw2337B-ms98-a-0021 115.413125 122.651500 and basically all of the races now are five K ten K fifteen K nobody runs in terms of miles anymore
sw2337B-ms98-a-0022 122.651500 125.881500 uh and i guess that's got me thinking metrically
sw2337B-ms98-a-0023 125.881500 133.692875 also uh uh we have lived overseas uh from nineteen eighty one to eighty four we lived in Quadalampor Malaysia
sw2337B-ms98-a-0024 133.692875 138.638375 and for in eighty five six and seven we lived in Baggio City in the Philippines
sw2337B-ms98-a-0025 138.638375 143.752875 and i guess you just get used to seeing distances beside the road marked metrically
sw2337B-ms98-a-0026 143.752875 151.854875 and ultimately at some point you know it doesn't happen overnight but at some point your frame of reference is metric at least in terms of distances
sw2337B-ms98-a-0027 151.854875 171.636125 [silence]
sw2337B-ms98-a-0028 171.636125 172.586250 okay
sw2337B-ms98-a-0029 172.586250 211.734125 [silence]
sw2337B-ms98-a-0030 211.734125 213.180125 oh yes yes
sw2337B-ms98-a-0031 213.180125 215.404000 [silence]
sw2337B-ms98-a-0032 215.404000 215.968875 yeah
sw2337B-ms98-a-0033 215.968875 219.395375 [silence]
sw2337B-ms98-a-0034 219.395375 224.763250 yeah i i i don't think it's going to happen in in in our lifetime at least not in mine
sw2337B-ms98-a-0035 224.763250 234.163125 uh i think uh there's a gigantic psychological barrier which may be a worse barrier than the old tool and die uh dimension in English
sw2337B-ms98-a-0036 234.163125 245.066750 uh and i think that the uh the ultimate solution will be to start introducing it uh in at at the introduction to school
sw2337B-ms98-a-0037 245.066750 245.860875 [noise]
sw2337B-ms98-a-0038 245.860875 249.098125 and uh hang on a sec Brian i got to get rid of that caller
sw2337B-ms98-a-0039 249.098125 251.174250 [noise]
sw2337B-ms98-a-0040 251.174250 258.542875 [silence]
sw2337B-ms98-a-0041 258.542875 259.742250 [noise] are you there
sw2337B-ms98-a-0042 259.742250 267.687625 okay i think the uh uh the solution is to start it at the earliest uh stages of schooling
sw2337B-ms98-a-0043 267.687625 274.011375 and uh uh make that the system to which kindergartners and first graders are introduced
sw2337B-ms98-a-0044 274.011375 281.430375 uh the drawback to that is i don't think we have any teachers in our other than physics teachers in our school system that are comfortable with it
sw2337B-ms98-a-0045 281.430375 283.011125 [laughter]
sw2337B-ms98-a-0046 283.011125 285.442375 [silence]
sw2337B-ms98-a-0047 285.442375 294.563625 and and chemists that's what i got my first degree in chemistry too and i and i and you know we don't talk in quarts and pints we talk in liters and milliliters 
sw2337B-ms98-a-0048 294.563625 304.509625 [silence]
sw2337B-ms98-a-0049 304.509625 315.228000 oh yeah i i i don't think we could even think English uh and i'm just thinking now in our business you know we make we make chips and uh we assemble them though
sw2337B-ms98-a-0050 315.228000 329.766000 and it's interesting we are uh uh basically talking well we talk about a package size yeah we talk about it in terms of uh uh six hundred mils or six uh tenths of an inch i guess we do that
sw2337B-ms98-a-0051 329.766000 342.272250 but on the other hand we talk about the force that it takes uh to move a die out of a package in other words how much uh uh how how well do we have the die uh inhering to the uh to the base
sw2337B-ms98-a-0052 342.272250 344.541500 and we talk about that in terms of kilograms
sw2337B-ms98-a-0053 344.541500 357.083875 so we use it a lot uh we talk about uh gold ball bonds uh bond strength we talk about that in terms of grams or in terms of kilograms to push the uh push the ball off its substrate
sw2337B-ms98-a-0054 357.083875 368.436250 so we we tend to have a mixed bag in new concepts uh that have come along with the electronic age i think just sort of get introduced metrically so that's the way we do it
sw2337B-ms98-a-0055 368.436250 369.336875 uh
sw2337B-ms98-a-0056 369.336875 421.311750 [silence]
sw2337B-ms98-a-0057 421.311750 422.024125 uh-huh
sw2337B-ms98-a-0058 422.024125 446.503500 [silence]
sw2337B-ms98-a-0059 446.503500 450.941625 right uh you you mentioned just a side light here you mentioned you lived in Brazil whereabouts
sw2337B-ms98-a-0060 450.941625 451.956500 [silence]
sw2337B-ms98-a-0061 451.956500 455.281375 oh Sao Paulo our our plant there is in Cantinas
sw2337B-ms98-a-0062 455.281375 457.245250 and i'm there several times a year
sw2337B-ms98-a-0063 457.245250 462.910500 uh and of course we fly into Sao Paulo and and drive on to uh uh Cantinas
sw2337B-ms98-a-0064 462.910500 468.691500 [silence]
sw2337B-ms98-a-0065 468.691500 470.921000 uh i use the other one
sw2337B-ms98-a-0066 470.921000 472.214250 i can't think the name of it
sw2337B-ms98-a-0067 472.214250 479.679750 yeah the international airport because i i generally fly in from uh well the last two times i've come in from Mexico City via Menaus
sw2337B-ms98-a-0068 479.679750 486.676375 and uh before that though it's uh it's uh Miami uh Rio De Janeiro Sao Paulo uh type flight
sw2337B-ms98-a-0069 486.676375 495.156625 and uh i just love it there i i absolutely uh uh uh love the i look forward to the times i go down there where did you get your from where did you get your physics degree
sw2337B-ms98-a-0070 495.156625 496.320000 [silence]
sw2337B-ms98-a-0071 496.320000 498.447000 oh okay okay
sw2337B-ms98-a-0072 498.447000 503.513875 yeah you like Colorado are are you a civilian employee about now or or military
sw2337B-ms98-a-0073 503.513875 505.459125 [silence]
sw2337B-ms98-a-0074 505.459125 506.954250 oh okay
sw2337B-ms98-a-0075 506.954250 513.694500 oh okay okay you're you're yo[u]- you're a bit younger than i thought uh back to the the metric system
sw2337B-ms98-a-0076 513.694500 526.714125 i've got a uh an automobile an eighty six Buick Skylark that's got an odometer uh that's a digital odometer in both units in other words i can push a button and it's in metric and i can push a button and it's in English
sw2337B-ms98-a-0077 526.714125 534.599500 and i i keep it in the metric uh all the all the time and we were taking another couple to a ball game last summer
sw2337B-ms98-a-0078 534.599500 549.289625 and it was uh floating up there around a a a [laughter-hundred] a hundred which is about is about sixty two miles an hour and it was floating up there about a hundred and the wife of the couple looked at me she said my God slow down i didn't realize you were going this fast
sw2337B-ms98-a-0079 549.289625 555.607125 and so we we you know we have a hard time getting people getting uh uh getting them to think metrically but
sw2337B-ms98-a-0080 555.607125 563.502000 it's going to be a big psychological barrier and i don't think that we can educate kids all the way to their adulthood and then introduce it to them
sw2337B-ms98-a-0081 563.502000 567.006625 because if we if we keep doing that it's it's not going to work
sw2337B-ms98-a-0082 567.006625 568.398250 but
sw2337B-ms98-a-0083 568.398250 574.360750 but but interestingly enough we think it makes sense to to think metrically with our money
sw2337B-ms98-a-0084 574.360750 580.191625 you know ten cents makes a dime ten dimes makes a dollar uh which is basically thinking metrically
sw2337B-ms98-a-0085 580.191625 588.789625 uh [vocalized-noise] but but why twelve inches make a feet a foot and three feet make a yard [laughter] i [laughter] you know
sw2337B-ms98-a-0086 588.789625 590.351500 [silence]
sw2337B-ms98-a-0087 590.351500 591.050125 yeah
