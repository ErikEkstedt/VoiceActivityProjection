sw2307A-ms98-a-0004 11.530375 15.593125 well obviously it's it's kind of a desert area

sw2307A-ms98-a-0009 30.002625 44.465500 i'll tell you uh considering well okay i've uh mostly throughout my life i've lived in in the smaller uh parts of of Texas and so moving to Dallas i was a little worried about the traffic 
sw2307A-ms98-a-0010 44.465500 45.930625 um
sw2307A-ms98-a-0011 45.930625 59.794625 the differences in terrain because uh you know Dallas is is a lot more hilly than it is where i i was living and i had just bought a new car and it had uh had st[andard]- standard on you know standard and i had never had a standard car before
sw2307A-ms98-a-0012 59.794625 71.121000 right so i mean i was real worried about you know having a a [vocalized-noise] a lot of ice and things like that we just had a wonderful winter i mean there was one or two days of ice the entire winter 
sw2307A-ms98-a-0013 71.121000 82.459625 i mean we had cold weather we had a little bit of snow here and there but i mean i couldn't have asked for better first year of getting used to Dallas and my car at the same time i mean it just worked out great for me
sw2307A-ms98-a-0014 82.459625 85.296500 [silence]

sw2307A-ms98-a-0038 181.503125 190.046375 yeah they've been they've actually been going at it for a good you know four weeks now i would think um
sw2307A-ms98-a-0039 190.046375 203.927500 you know in fact it's kind of funny uh you know you're watching the newscast i don't know about way up they are up there but the weather cast down here one of the things that they like to do is to tell you what's all in the air you know the fungus and the the trees you know [vocalized-noise] yeah well 
sw2307A-ms98-a-0040 203.927500 212.307875 but mostly it's you know allergy type index and it's been like like i said about four weeks now that uh they've had um
sw2307A-ms98-a-0041 212.307875 223.989625 multiple pages of things and you know of of names of things in the air and uh you know so that's a real good sign that that the trees are in bloom and the flowers are in bloom and stuff like that
sw2307A-ms98-a-0042 223.989625 225.920625 pollen count yeah exactly
sw2307A-ms98-a-0043 225.920625 236.139250 [silence]

sw2307A-ms98-a-0050 256.673000 266.703750 well it's it's um it depends on what part of the south i think the farther east you go you know from from here on east uh you do have a a limited
sw2307A-ms98-a-0051 266.703750 276.846625 winter um now south of here uh like in Houston i did uh even though i said i lived mostly in the small towns i lived a short time in Houston it was winter 
sw2307A-ms98-a-0052 276.846625 285.816125 and you know the coldest day we got down there was like in the sixties you [laughter-know] when it got down in the sixties you were cold down there [laughter] 
sw2307A-ms98-a-0053 285.816125 286.879250 yeah

sw2307A-ms98-a-0063 311.109375 320.169250 oh yes it's a big difference i have a one of my friends is from Kansas City and uh he has lived down here for like eleven years but he refuses
sw2307A-ms98-a-0064 320.169250 330.812875 to get to to where everybody else is i mean he will [vocalized-noise] he will not wear long sleeve shirts he will not wear you know jackets and things like that i mean he's the only person i know 
sw2307A-ms98-a-0065 330.812875 341.261625 that in thirty degree weather still has a short sleeve shirt on you know um but it you know it's still not cold cold here uh compared to what he's used to so 
sw2307A-ms98-a-0066 341.261625 352.919625 [silence]
sw2307A-ms98-a-0067 352.919625 353.840875 um-hum

sw2307A-ms98-a-0069 358.846625 361.337500 well i think that's true yeah
sw2307A-ms98-a-0070 361.337500 365.301875 although there's you know there's you don't ever want to get
sw2307A-ms98-a-0071 365.301875 378.156125 too much different to what i mean uh i grew up with a lot of trees around and then i lived out like i said in West Texas where it's desert and there's not a lot of trees and that's the main reason i moved up here was that i did not i mean i hated
sw2307A-ms98-a-0072 378.156125 384.886250 seeing you know no trees i mean it's just you could stand on a rooftop and see for miles and miles and miles you know 
sw2307A-ms98-a-0073 384.886250 394.296250 [silence]
sw2307A-ms98-a-0074 394.296250 400.161625 well now that's that's not necessarily true there are people that are born out there that can't stand it here
sw2307A-ms98-a-0075 400.161625 410.270000 they they feel claustrophobic around trees i thought that was hilarious when i first heard it but i mean i heard it from more than one person so it's got to be somewhat true i mean
sw2307A-ms98-a-0076 410.270000 412.974125 [silence]
sw2307A-ms98-a-0077 412.974125 414.373875 exactly

sw2307A-ms98-a-0079 416.047125 421.725750 yeah i see i wouldn't have thought that from the beginning but uh i've talked to so many people about it that it makes sense now i guess 
sw2307A-ms98-a-0080 421.725750 422.896875 [silence]
sw2307A-ms98-a-0081 422.896875 429.725500 hum i agree i agree of course i wouldn't mind having an area with ocean but we won't get involved in that either
sw2307A-ms98-a-0082 429.725500 431.170125 yeah yeah that sounds good
