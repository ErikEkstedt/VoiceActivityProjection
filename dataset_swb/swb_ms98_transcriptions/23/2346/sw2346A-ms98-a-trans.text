sw2346A-ms98-a-0028 121.856625 131.629750 i found that uh well one occasion i i heard a little noise and i saw the dog walking away and i looked over and i see some feathers sticking out of his mouth
sw2346A-ms98-a-0029 131.629750 138.991875 and i grabbed the dog by the tail real quick and i discovered if you yank a dog's tail real hard he lets go of a bird [laughter]
sw2346A-ms98-a-0030 138.991875 144.162500 [laughter]

sw2346A-ms98-a-0036 178.199750 185.196625 well there is a a neighbor of mine used to uh uh know quite a bit about uh raising parakeets
sw2346A-ms98-a-0037 185.196625 189.435750 and she had uh a lot of connections when it came to getting good birds
sw2346A-ms98-a-0038 189.435750 194.540000 so she was knowledgeable all the different breeds and colorations and so forth
sw2346A-ms98-a-0039 194.540000 197.953000 knew what to look for when you went shopping for a parakeet 
sw2346A-ms98-a-0040 197.953000 203.622250 uh i had a parakeet many years ago that uh she got for me
sw2346A-ms98-a-0041 203.622250 207.484750 and it lived to be a a pretty old bird
sw2346A-ms98-a-0042 207.484750 209.935125 and was extremely friendly
sw2346A-ms98-a-0043 209.935125 215.374375 uh i i couldn't keep him in his own cage he just uh flew lose in the house all the time
sw2346A-ms98-a-0044 215.374375 222.320875 uh but uh more recent years they moved away and i've been buying parakeets at the local pet shop
sw2346A-ms98-a-0045 222.320875 227.171750 and they don't seem to be as healthy as uh one's you get from uh breeders
sw2346A-ms98-a-0046 227.171750 233.524250 [silence]
sw2346A-ms98-a-0047 233.524250 234.500500 yeah

sw2346A-ms98-a-0050 247.048750 252.675000 [silence]
sw2346A-ms98-a-0051 252.675000 258.604500 well we found in general when you you look for breeders you don't find them in the uh metropolitan areas
sw2346A-ms98-a-0052 258.604500 264.354625 they you wind up going many miles out of town to find somebody that's handling whatever it is you're looking for
sw2346A-ms98-a-0053 264.354625 267.492750 we went looking for uh rabbits
sw2346A-ms98-a-0054 267.492750 272.788375 and we had to go all the way out to Leesburg to find uh a rabbitry a few years back
sw2346A-ms98-a-0055 272.788375 274.354500 [silence]
sw2346A-ms98-a-0056 274.354500 281.168375 weren't any uh rabbits available in this area except little bunnies available at the uh pet shops
sw2346A-ms98-a-0057 281.168375 284.806125 and we looked at them and decided they weren't uh too healthy looking
sw2346A-ms98-a-0058 284.806125 294.528875 [silence]
sw2346A-ms98-a-0059 294.528875 295.827250 uh-huh

sw2346A-ms98-a-0067 334.700000 340.019250 that's pretty unusual because w[e]- i've generally found that rabbits have been very uh very good parents
sw2346A-ms98-a-0068 340.019250 349.358750 [silence]
sw2346A-ms98-a-0069 349.358750 350.474125 uh-huh

sw2346A-ms98-a-0076 376.759500 378.916250 [silence]
sw2346A-ms98-a-0077 378.916250 380.210500 so uh

sw2346A-ms98-a-0086 422.972375 432.516375 yeah well we had uh i lived on a farm when i was growing up and when we bought the farm there was uh couple of farm cats on the property
sw2346A-ms98-a-0087 432.516375 436.703000 and they were sort of tame every now and then they'd let you pet them
sw2346A-ms98-a-0088 436.703000 446.536500 but uh one of the cats which we named Bug Eyes she had a litter of kittens and she kept them away from the uh the house until they were pretty good size kittens
sw2346A-ms98-a-0089 446.536500 450.198375 and they wouldn't let you get anywhere near them
sw2346A-ms98-a-0090 450.198375 459.075750 and one day i went over to i found them sleeping and i went over and picked one of them up and it boy it was like picking up a buzz saw [laughter]
