sw2346B-ms98-a-0041 227.552500 234.103875 you might check uh some of the ads in the paper and see if anybody has an aviary that you might be able to buy from there
sw2346B-ms98-a-0042 234.103875 242.686625 that seems to be an up and coming business i know out there where we are there's there's uh a person on each side of our
sw2346B-ms98-a-0043 242.686625 246.477250 county that now have aviaries
sw2346B-ms98-a-0044 246.477250 247.843500 [silence]
sw2346B-ms98-a-0045 247.843500 252.388000 one of them is right out there close to us they're in the process of building it up right now
sw2346B-ms98-a-0046 252.388000 253.810750 i know
sw2346B-ms98-a-0047 253.810750 263.591750 [silence]

sw2346B-ms98-a-0050 284.558000 289.639000 yeah that's the problem with buying them through the pet shops we have that same problem here too
sw2346B-ms98-a-0051 289.639000 295.326750 yeah but we've used it we just have two rabbits right now we have one doe and one buck
sw2346B-ms98-a-0052 295.326750 301.195875 and she ought to be due sometime toward the end of this week on a litter we just got her
sw2346B-ms98-a-0053 301.195875 302.916625 the uh
sw2346B-ms98-a-0054 302.916625 307.661375 we go we had uh one doe that we'd had
sw2346B-ms98-a-0055 307.661375 309.494625 her
sw2346B-ms98-a-0056 309.494625 316.005000 let's see it was her second litter i guess the first litter she had she lost all but three
sw2346B-ms98-a-0057 316.005000 320.936500 uh babies and we raised those and then her second litter
sw2346B-ms98-a-0058 320.936500 324.189125 she wound up killing all of them_1
sw2346B-ms98-a-0059 324.189125 330.399000 and it took her like three days i guess before she killed all of them so we've we had to get rid of her
sw2346B-ms98-a-0060 330.399000 332.504250 so i i
sw2346B-ms98-a-0061 332.504250 335.391375 wouldn't tolerate that
sw2346B-ms98-a-0062 335.391375 339.300125 [silence]
sw2346B-ms98-a-0063 339.300125 344.343625 yeah well this is the first time we've ever had one like that we had been down we had
sw2346B-ms98-a-0064 344.343625 350.258375 gone from having one buck and and three does down to one buck and just one doe
sw2346B-ms98-a-0065 350.258375 354.358125 but that didn't work out too well so now we're we're trying to build it back up

sw2346B-ms98-a-0081 468.276750 473.175250 and the first time you try to get around the kittens you know it's you'd have to catch them with a
sw2346B-ms98-a-0082 473.175250 478.222125 uh a fish net or something because they scamper away so quick
sw2346B-ms98-a-0083 478.222125 485.824500 [silence]
