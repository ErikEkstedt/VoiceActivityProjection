sw2379A-ms98-a-0059 208.669625 210.883500 well that i've been aware of i've
sw2379A-ms98-a-0060 210.883500 221.933375 at least in my own circles i've been aware of an increasing from my generation i don't know if i can quite call myself a distinct generation from you but half generation off i guess um
sw2379A-ms98-a-0061 221.933375 223.659875 i've noticed uh
sw2379A-ms98-a-0062 223.659875 234.526125 a certain increase um pessimism with America no longer being sort of on top [vocalized-noise] i had the impression 
sw2379A-ms98-a-0063 234.526125 236.044750 [noise]
sw2379A-ms98-a-0064 236.044750 248.113500 well i mean there was the quote unquote losing of the Vietnam war which was a blow and it was right around that time when i started becoming socially [vocalized-noise] you know a socially conscious adult and 
sw2379A-ms98-a-0065 248.113500 252.847250 i realize that people of my age have no um
sw2379A-ms98-a-0066 252.847250 264.618125 no major success in the sense that uh you saw the passage of the Civil Rights Act and um major social change in that sense and i
sw2379A-ms98-a-0067 264.618125 271.615125 and all the changes that have happened in the last uh even during my adulthood have been more incremental
sw2379A-ms98-a-0068 271.615125 282.547500 they've been continual perhaps and good gains have been made but there hasn't been the same sort of fiery speeches of Martin Luther King or whatever that has really uh galvanized the population
sw2379A-ms98-a-0069 282.547500 288.868500 and there's just instead there's been sort of an increasing oh i don't know Japan bashing and things like that
sw2379A-ms98-a-0070 288.868500 291.583375 and uh a lot of i see
sw2379A-ms98-a-0071 291.583375 292.709375 [silence]
sw2379A-ms98-a-0072 292.709375 301.619500 among some of my friends and even more among some of my students who are you know maybe twenty a real sense of you know America's losing it
sw2379A-ms98-a-0073 301.619500 308.791750 and losing it in the competitive market and a real knowl[edge]- uh a lack of understanding how that could be
sw2379A-ms98-a-0074 308.791750 317.285625 and in the sense that how could America have gone from being number one to possibly being number two to you know our former enemies and things like that and um
sw2379A-ms98-a-0075 317.285625 322.943125 so i see i see a lot of uh a lot of pessimism growing um
sw2379A-ms98-a-0076 322.943125 324.308625 [silence]
sw2379A-ms98-a-0077 324.308625 329.179125 and at the same time i think there's there's there's a growing environmentalist movement
sw2379A-ms98-a-0078 329.179125 342.839625 and sense of corporate respons[ible]- increased corporate responsible towards uh you know environmental safety and things like that and that might potentially be sort of the civil right the equivalent of the Civil Rights Act in in the near future
sw2379A-ms98-a-0079 342.839625 352.827625 in terms of you know some real landmark bills passing and things like that such that you know people cause thing about civil rights is people take it for granted now i mean my generation doesn't
sw2379A-ms98-a-0080 352.827625 361.439750 can't rest on the the glow of having achieved civil rights because we were born into an assumption that you know yes there's still some racism but
sw2379A-ms98-a-0081 361.439750 373.244375 you know basically things are [vocalized-noise] the assumption things are basically kind of taken care of and there's a notion of fairness that um while still far from perfect is much more established i think

sw2379A-ms98-a-0113 518.815875 526.655125 yeah well i'd i'd say actually i mean as someone who's involved in education i'd say that maybe one of the changes is that the
sw2379A-ms98-a-0114 526.655125 535.389125 role of the teacher has incrementally gotten lower and lower value and society i mean relative pay which is a major way we value people has been
sw2379A-ms98-a-0115 535.389125 546.798375 poorer and poorer over the years uh you know that there's been cost of living increases but not quite in proportion to cost of living and you know it's just more and more uh
sw2379A-ms98-a-0116 546.798375 560.691375 [vocalized-noise] a real low income sort of job and very low prestige i mean there's that that old saying those who can do it and those who can't teach this is the way of let's make fun of the teachers those are the people who can't do anything and if you have that kind of social attitude it's
sw2379A-ms98-a-0117 560.691375 570.623750 hard to get sufficient numbers of people who are going to overlook all of that work for lower pay work for low social prestige just because they care about good education
sw2379A-ms98-a-0118 570.623750 581.420875 and you get more and more people who would just end up there because it's uh it's the safety net of those of you know average intelligence or something they can always teach
