sw2379B-ms98-a-0003 7.010000 12.162125 well let's see well we assume i was an adult twenty years ago [laughter] um
sw2379B-ms98-a-0004 12.162125 14.785750 [silence]
sw2379B-ms98-a-0005 14.785750 29.354000 uh yeah definitely able to go to war twenty years ago but not vote not vote that was one of the changes that came about in the last twenty years um yeah twenty years ago was nineteen seventy uh nineteen seventy i had been married two years
sw2379B-ms98-a-0006 29.354000 33.460625 um we had all the great civil rights legislation of nineteen sixty eight
sw2379B-ms98-a-0007 33.460625 40.222000 and uh around here on the uh east coast uh we were heavy into affirmative action
sw2379B-ms98-a-0008 40.222000 45.572000 and uh that was a uh a great shock for a lot of people
sw2379B-ms98-a-0009 45.572000 50.072000 and uh a great disappointment for some people like myself
sw2379B-ms98-a-0010 50.072000 53.901750 um i was gainfully employed by Safeway Stores Incorporated
sw2379B-ms98-a-0011 53.901750 57.488375 and uh trying desperately to uh get ahead with the company
sw2379B-ms98-a-0012 57.488375 60.281500 uh the problem was that my hair was too long
sw2379B-ms98-a-0013 60.281500 71.487500 and uh that you weren't allowed to have a uh mustache or a beard and uh you know jeans just flat out weren't allowed unless you worked on night stock and
sw2379B-ms98-a-0014 71.487500 81.569500 [noise] if you wanted to get ahead with the company well if you were a uh black female you were destined to be store manager in six to nine months if you were white male you're talking six years
sw2379B-ms98-a-0015 81.569500 90.939875 and that's basically where i ended up i uh i just flat out couldn't get a hold you know [vocalized-noise] get ahead with the company because they were dead in affirmative action um 
sw2379B-ms98-a-0016 90.939875 94.439625 on other fronts um
sw2379B-ms98-a-0017 94.439625 99.964875 [silence]
sw2379B-ms98-a-0018 99.964875 107.656000 um i think so i- i i i stopped working for them in uh seventy eight seventy nine
sw2379B-ms98-a-0019 107.656000 121.600750 and uh [noise] it's i think they're they're like all companies well represented and uh you know everything seems to be fine i i've kind of lost touch with the company we had a falling out but uh
sw2379B-ms98-a-0020 121.600750 131.520000 as far as uh as their management goes um i'm not sure they're any any better off than they were were before management wise
sw2379B-ms98-a-0021 131.520000 135.227500 but uh other changes um
sw2379B-ms98-a-0022 135.227500 136.667000 just
sw2379B-ms98-a-0023 136.667000 137.725000 [silence]
sw2379B-ms98-a-0024 137.725000 139.873000 people seem to be more
sw2379B-ms98-a-0025 139.873000 153.868125 outspoken now individually rather than collectively um back in the seventies we had uh a lot of uh protests against the war and uh bring our troops home and things were more organized
sw2379B-ms98-a-0026 153.868125 156.187625 and uh i've noticed that
sw2379B-ms98-a-0027 156.187625 161.997125 now more and more individual people are speaking out for their own rights rather than massing together
sw2379B-ms98-a-0028 161.997125 162.884125 [silence]
sw2379B-ms98-a-0029 162.884125 164.032000 um
sw2379B-ms98-a-0030 164.032000 171.232500 [silence]
sw2379B-ms98-a-0031 171.232500 184.547625 yeah i'm not sure if that was because you know eighties was like the uh the me decade [vocalized-noise] and uh everybody was into me and then we are getting back into us but um it it 
sw2379B-ms98-a-0032 184.547625 187.593750 it's i've seen uh
sw2379B-ms98-a-0033 187.593750 192.411000 uh a great deal of change as far as um
sw2379B-ms98-a-0034 192.411000 196.039625 corporate responsibility and things um
sw2379B-ms98-a-0035 196.039625 197.647125 and
sw2379B-ms98-a-0036 197.647125 204.060000 people's response to that you know at first not trusting and now expecting more
sw2379B-ms98-a-0037 204.060000 209.618125 and what ab[out]- what about the last ten years that you've been aware
sw2379B-ms98-a-0038 209.618125 287.887250 [silence]
sw2379B-ms98-a-0039 287.887250 289.678750 uh-huh
sw2379B-ms98-a-0040 289.678750 300.547375 [silence]
sw2379B-ms98-a-0041 300.547375 302.287375 yes

sw2379B-ms98-a-0046 368.172625 373.544250 [silence]
sw2379B-ms98-a-0047 373.544250 381.240750 [vocalized-noise] but even uh i think uh along the line of the uh goals of civil rights um
sw2379B-ms98-a-0048 381.240750 389.596750 there always seems to be some prejudice to someone by anyone i mean you know [vocalized-noise]
sw2379B-ms98-a-0049 389.596750 400.766875 you know don't like the way you look don't like the way you dress don't like your hair don't you know it's just something that always sets people off you know you either like someone or you don't like someone or you're just completely indifferent 
sw2379B-ms98-a-0050 400.766875 401.941500 [noise]
sw2379B-ms98-a-0051 401.941500 412.606500 and the problem is that ideally you they you know the world would like you to be completely indifferent so um but i- i i understand what you say about the environmental movement um
sw2379B-ms98-a-0052 412.606500 419.082875 it's it's been a long time coming um being a uh a very old hippie um [laughter] 
sw2379B-ms98-a-0053 419.082875 430.967375 i mean you know if you had long hair in high school in the sixties you got labeled a hippie and you keep that image your whole life [laughter] [vocalized-noise] no matter what you do and i- i just 
sw2379B-ms98-a-0054 430.967375 435.208250 i've seen a lot of changes i mean from the original earth day
sw2379B-ms98-a-0055 435.208250 446.567875 and um i'm heavily involved in you know my own personal recycling we recycle paper and cans here at work and you know i do the newspaper and cardboard and paper and
sw2379B-ms98-a-0056 446.567875 452.867375 you know all that stuff at home and i'm starting to see more and more recycling centers cropping up all over the place here on the east coast
sw2379B-ms98-a-0057 452.867375 456.985875 [silence]
sw2379B-ms98-a-0058 456.985875 458.280000 [laughter-yeah]
sw2379B-ms98-a-0059 458.280000 459.472250 like
sw2379B-ms98-a-0060 459.472250 461.140000 [silence]
sw2379B-ms98-a-0061 461.140000 462.207000 yeah
sw2379B-ms98-a-0062 462.207000 466.427750 [silence]
sw2379B-ms98-a-0063 466.427750 467.628625 and then they
sw2379B-ms98-a-0064 467.628625 472.289375 turned around and called them junkyards and started making profits off them after the war
sw2379B-ms98-a-0065 472.289375 485.134125 and now we got to the point where the junkyards you've got to pay them to take something there so things have really changed a lot i think the uh the other part about uh America's decline i think has to do with
sw2379B-ms98-a-0066 485.134125 493.477625 yeah the perceived decline has to do with uh um the attitudes and the educational system
sw2379B-ms98-a-0067 493.477625 505.364750 uh i have children in in s[chool]- i have three children in school right now and i'm not impressed with the teachers that are teaching them uh i had when i was down in Dallas for two years i had uh
sw2379B-ms98-a-0068 505.364750 511.079000 my children come home from school with papers that were corrected by the teacher that had words spelled correctly marked wrong
sw2379B-ms98-a-0069 511.079000 514.754625 and words spelled wrong not marked as such
sw2379B-ms98-a-0070 514.754625 517.477375 and this person's teaching my children
sw2379B-ms98-a-0071 517.477375 520.145250 you know i had a real problem with that
sw2379B-ms98-a-0072 520.145250 531.957875 [silence]
sw2379B-ms98-a-0073 531.957875 533.875750 [noise]

sw2379B-ms98-a-0081 579.360375 587.669250 um i'm not sure if your familiar with the movement they have here in Maryland but they're trying to get a uh a uh
sw2379B-ms98-a-0082 587.669250 592.608000 a merit system here in Maryland rather than a uh tenure system
sw2379B-ms98-a-0083 592.608000 597.906500 for all the you know elementary middle school and high schools
sw2379B-ms98-a-0084 597.906500 598.938000 so that the teach
