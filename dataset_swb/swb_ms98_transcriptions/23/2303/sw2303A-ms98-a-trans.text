sw2303A-ms98-a-0006 10.808750 22.121000 yeah um i i suspect the apathy is is due to something like people just feeling that that their vote doesn't count anyway i mean why why bother voting if
sw2303A-ms98-a-0007 22.121000 32.416375 um if your vote won't make a difference so for instance in um the last presidential election i'm sure a lot of people thought oh Bush is going to win either way why bother voting
sw2303A-ms98-a-0008 32.416375 33.268750 [vocalized-noise]

sw2303A-ms98-a-0010 34.603625 47.128875 that's right i think that's and and the other side of the coin is um people saying well if i really like the underdog candidate i still think they're not going to win so some are saying Dukakis is certainly not going to win why bother voting for him so
sw2303A-ms98-a-0011 47.128875 51.783625 i thi[nk]- i i think that's a big uh a big a big reason for it how about_1

sw2303A-ms98-a-0013 63.595375 67.085250 um that's true actually i never thought about that that that's a good rea[son]-

sw2303A-ms98-a-0015 76.889375 78.942750 that's true that's true

sw2303A-ms98-a-0019 85.051875 92.937375 i think on the local elections it's actually um i think um i think people vote in the larger elections because
sw2303A-ms98-a-0020 92.937375 107.264000 they feel like well you know the country's real important and you know if i el[ect]- if we help elect a president who's going to save us then the then the whole country will be saved but they figure local elections don't mean that much i suspect so people don't really worry about their local mayor or something figuring that you know
sw2303A-ms98-a-0021 107.264000 118.506875 um and i think wrongly figuring that that well what good is another mayor going to do anyway because our federal taxes are more important right now and you know and stuff like that so people think that that that they don't have
sw2303A-ms98-a-0022 118.506875 124.018875 um that that it does[n't]- doesn't matter as much whereas i think it's probably just the opposite is true
sw2303A-ms98-a-0023 124.018875 127.606500 i think it's probably the case that people could have more effect on a local level
sw2303A-ms98-a-0024 127.606500 139.692000 [silence]
sw2303A-ms98-a-0025 139.692000 140.734625 uh

sw2303A-ms98-a-0033 169.771625 176.214125 yeah that that's possible i still think that that a lot of those people are the ones who really think that their votes don't make a difference though as well
sw2303A-ms98-a-0034 176.214125 187.155375 i think it's those same people who don't know any better about how we vote are are are a lot of the people who think that well look at me i'm just a little nobody my vote's not going to count anyway
sw2303A-ms98-a-0035 187.155375 192.372875 you know and i think that's probably a portion of the population that's massively under represent[ed]- i i i would guess
sw2303A-ms98-a-0036 192.372875 196.459250 that tha[t]- that portion of the population is massively under represented and

sw2303A-ms98-a-0038 207.908375 210.356750 hum what do they have to do with one another

sw2303A-ms98-a-0040 223.729125 227.324125 oh so they didn't want to wind up being a juror ever
sw2303A-ms98-a-0041 227.324125 230.793125 [silence]
sw2303A-ms98-a-0042 230.793125 233.397250 oh i didn't realize that actually that

sw2303A-ms98-a-0044 234.796125 239.170875 yeah there is there there there are much easier ways to get out of jury duty [laughter]
sw2303A-ms98-a-0045 239.170875 244.210500 just go in and say oh i want to be a juror i can spot a guilty person a mile away
sw2303A-ms98-a-0046 244.210500 252.867875 [silence]
sw2303A-ms98-a-0047 252.867875 262.749625 well that that just seems to be a person who just doesn't care about much of anything around sort of you know doesn't doesn't sort of likes rights probably but doesn't like respon[sibilities]- responsibilities
sw2303A-ms98-a-0048 262.749625 264.592500 no i think
sw2303A-ms98-a-0049 264.592500 275.021125 i mean that's that's what it what it boils down to is people like to s[ay]- you know people say well i don't want to be on jury you know i don't want to serve on jury duty i don't want to vote i don't want to do this and that well then they could you know i
sw2303A-ms98-a-0050 275.021125 282.649375 put them in the reverse situation in the place where they don't have the right to be on jury duty and and they don't have the right to vote i suspect their opinions would change very quickly
sw2303A-ms98-a-0051 282.649375 290.948250 [silence]

sw2303A-ms98-a-0054 297.980250 303.725750 yes they were they were doing that unfortunately what what they were they had they had no idea what they were voting on [laughter]
sw2303A-ms98-a-0055 303.725750 305.504875 it turns out
sw2303A-ms98-a-0056 305.504875 317.614000 that's right but but it's the thought they all got out but you wonder if you know if if now the next election they have if only half of them_1 are actually going to show up or how many generations it will take until only half of the voters show up in Russia
sw2303A-ms98-a-0057 317.614000 318.621875 [silence]
sw2303A-ms98-a-0058 318.621875 320.571500 right that that's true [laughter]

sw2303A-ms98-a-0062 324.324750 332.049000 now if things go the way that that that that they are there i think that they'll keep voting but i think they'll wind up like us at some point where people sort of 
sw2303A-ms98-a-0063 332.049000 337.309750 only half of them_1 will end up voting and sort of caring enough to really make a statement so
sw2303A-ms98-a-0064 337.309750 346.657125 you know i think i think that that the people who most need to vote sometimes are the are the ones who who are really out to make a statement because you know when when
sw2303A-ms98-a-0065 346.657125 356.506750 when you've got an underdog candidate who represents something and even if he doesn't win a large number of people voting for that particular candidate does i think make a statement to everyone else
sw2303A-ms98-a-0066 356.506750 357.546375 [silence]
sw2303A-ms98-a-0067 357.546375 358.801125 i think that
sw2303A-ms98-a-0068 358.801125 361.498250 yeah i think and i i think that's real important
sw2303A-ms98-a-0069 361.498250 364.188250 [silence]
sw2303A-ms98-a-0070 364.188250 365.716625 that's probably true

sw2303A-ms98-a-0075 375.470500 384.991375 i said well well a[ctually]- a[ctually]- the the female who i would most rally behind right now right i don't know much about her politics that's about a way the way she makes speeches is a is a local person for you is Ann Richards
sw2303A-ms98-a-0076 384.991375 386.191750 [silence]
sw2303A-ms98-a-0077 386.191750 398.458875 i don't know her politics i just know that uh i saw her speak in the eighty four Democratic uh convention and right then and there if they said to me vote for someone for president i would have slapped down my vote for Ann Richards
sw2303A-ms98-a-0078 398.458875 410.691875 [silence]
sw2303A-ms98-a-0079 410.691875 414.708375 [laughter] that's very good

sw2303A-ms98-a-0081 419.077875 427.756500 that that's that's that's very good that's i i like that so i would uh i would i would vote for her without and i i suspect she could get a large voter turnout
sw2303A-ms98-a-0082 427.756500 430.765375 [silence]
sw2303A-ms98-a-0083 430.765375 444.862375 say i i i would think that um that that people like that i think in[flammatory]- inflammatory politicians are um or or emotional politicians you know certain very vibrant politicians tend to bring crowds out i think
sw2303A-ms98-a-0084 444.862375 446.064625 i would hope

sw2303A-ms98-a-0110 515.273500 516.816500 but on the other hand

sw2303A-ms98-a-0119 531.672000 533.629250 [silence]
sw2303A-ms98-a-0120 533.629250 544.750000 i've had one idea that i think is is is completely undoable but it but i think i[t]- b[ut]- but i suspect it would work and the way to do it is to get an absolutely atrocious candidate who you never expect to win
sw2303A-ms98-a-0121 544.750000 555.380750 to go out and make inflammatory and ridiculous and stupid statements so that a large population of of of voters will go out and vote against that person for someone else
sw2303A-ms98-a-0122 555.380750 566.385875 [laughter] so given a choice between you know so so if you have so if if imagine a world where you have two real candidates and one idiot who goes out and makes you know anti you know sort of um
sw2303A-ms98-a-0123 566.385875 576.138500 anti women statements anti Semitic statements anti black statements et cetera et cetera well then i suspect a lot of people would go out and choose a candidate to vote for just just to spite that person [laughter]
sw2303A-ms98-a-0124 576.138500 578.934625 but i suspect that that that would actually never work [laughter]

sw2303A-ms98-a-0130 595.579125 599.136125 that that that that that would be interesting yes i think that would work in some places yeah
