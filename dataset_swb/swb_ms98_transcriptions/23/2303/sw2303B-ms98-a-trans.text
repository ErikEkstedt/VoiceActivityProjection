sw2303B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.473375 [noise]
sw2303B-ms98-a-0002 0.473375 3.778750 all right we need to discuss the voters
sw2303B-ms98-a-0003 3.778750 11.189000 on a national and a local level why do you think the apathy exists i blame it to apathy
sw2303B-ms98-a-0004 11.189000 32.151875 [silence]
sw2303B-ms98-a-0005 32.151875 35.389250 why should i go out of my way when it doesn't matter
sw2303B-ms98-a-0006 35.389250 50.938000 [silence]
sw2303B-ms98-a-0007 50.938000 64.138875 oh i think so too and i think the other thing is the news me[dia]- media puts such a blitz on it that they've uh they had it predetermined with a half of one percent voting you know 
sw2303B-ms98-a-0008 64.138875 66.121500 [silence]
sw2303B-ms98-a-0009 66.121500 77.664375 and i i think the you hear the news you know you start out in the morning and all day you hear the news and by time say you get off work and go to vote you feel like it doesn't make any difference
sw2303B-ms98-a-0010 77.664375 83.071875 due to the overabundance of news we have available to us
sw2303B-ms98-a-0011 83.071875 85.683625 what do you think on the local elections though
sw2303B-ms98-a-0012 85.683625 126.752875 [silence]
sw2303B-ms98-a-0013 126.752875 131.712500 oh i think so too absolutely uh i think another thing
sw2303B-ms98-a-0014 131.712500 138.684875 and uh i'm making a judgment here that may or may i think it is totally wrong well
sw2303B-ms98-a-0015 138.684875 139.868875 [silence]
sw2303B-ms98-a-0016 139.868875 149.619000 i think that the people that are u[m]- have um a lower income which you automatically equate with lower education
sw2303B-ms98-a-0017 149.619000 152.527125 [noise] tend not to be registered
sw2303B-ms98-a-0018 152.527125 165.890125 and they don't register and they don't understand that you can't go and vote and register all at the same time or when it gets down to the point of someone saying are you going to vote today they say well i would
sw2303B-ms98-a-0019 165.890125 169.673375 and i believe in this but
sw2303B-ms98-a-0020 169.673375 195.577750 [silence]
sw2303B-ms98-a-0021 195.577750 202.352375 i had an interesting comment one time a thought that would never have crossed my mind i had someone tell me that
sw2303B-ms98-a-0022 202.352375 206.937500 i will never register to vote because i don't serve on a jury
sw2303B-ms98-a-0023 206.937500 209.645375 [laughter]
sw2303B-ms98-a-0024 209.645375 223.593750 [laughter] [laughter-that's] [laughter-i] i i just i tha[t]- i just wandered off from that one i was just so surprised and amazed with the statement that they say only registered voters can be picked for jury selection
sw2303B-ms98-a-0025 223.593750 226.848125 [silence]
sw2303B-ms98-a-0026 226.848125 230.964625 so they were if they don't vote they don't have to be on a jury
sw2303B-ms98-a-0027 230.964625 232.611750 [silence]
sw2303B-ms98-a-0028 232.611750 235.212750 there is convoluted logic for you
sw2303B-ms98-a-0029 235.212750 237.863125 [silence]
sw2303B-ms98-a-0030 237.863125 240.513375 [laughter-yes]
sw2303B-ms98-a-0031 240.513375 243.619250 [silence]
sw2303B-ms98-a-0032 243.619250 253.875250 [laughter-oh] i just right right there are so many other ways but that one just it defeated me i didn't have any answer for that one that one was just beyond my imagination
sw2303B-ms98-a-0033 253.875250 262.904875 [silence]
sw2303B-ms98-a-0034 262.904875 265.411500 that's a good point you're probably right
sw2303B-ms98-a-0035 265.411500 280.002250 [silence]
sw2303B-ms98-a-0036 280.002250 280.980875 which

sw2303B-ms98-a-0038 282.118125 291.752500 and that was what i was thinking exactly about because in the Soviet Union they had an election and they had what like a ninety eight percent turnout
sw2303B-ms98-a-0039 291.752500 298.743875 a massive turnout at last someone wants us to vote they were standing in lines to vote
sw2303B-ms98-a-0040 298.743875 304.538250 [silence]
sw2303B-ms98-a-0041 304.538250 307.225375 and their vote didn't count [laughter]
sw2303B-ms98-a-0042 307.225375 317.221250 [silence]
sw2303B-ms98-a-0043 317.221250 318.934750 or any one shows up
sw2303B-ms98-a-0044 318.934750 319.966750 [silence]
sw2303B-ms98-a-0045 319.966750 324.741000 total indifference you know what difference does it make back gone the full circle
sw2303B-ms98-a-0046 324.741000 355.114375 [silence]
sw2303B-ms98-a-0047 355.114375 359.290500 oh certainly there's a message there even if they lose
sw2303B-ms98-a-0048 359.290500 361.526750 [silence]
sw2303B-ms98-a-0049 361.526750 364.792875 oh and i think women turn out to vote for women too
sw2303B-ms98-a-0050 364.792875 372.665000 y[eah]- yeah i thin[k]- well i know it's true you see a lot of that you know rally behind the female she may lose but by golly we're going to make a statement here
sw2303B-ms98-a-0051 372.665000 373.520000 you know
sw2303B-ms98-a-0052 373.520000 385.245750 [silence]
sw2303B-ms98-a-0053 385.245750 386.834625 oh okay
sw2303B-ms98-a-0054 386.834625 396.822625 [silence]
sw2303B-ms98-a-0055 396.822625 404.596750 [laughter] was was that the time no that was l[ater]- eighty four that's too soon she said something about uh
sw2303B-ms98-a-0056 404.596750 407.618250 Ginger Rogers d[id]- did everything Fred
sw2303B-ms98-a-0057 407.618250 411.172000 Astaire did and she did it backwards in high heels
sw2303B-ms98-a-0058 411.172000 414.513625 [silence]
sw2303B-ms98-a-0059 414.513625 419.515375 [laughter] she said that i [laughter-didn't] said you know don't tell me what women can do [laughter]
sw2303B-ms98-a-0060 419.515375 427.287125 [silence]
sw2303B-ms98-a-0061 427.287125 431.375750 i think i did vote for her as a matter of fact i'm pretty sure i did
sw2303B-ms98-a-0062 431.375750 445.586625 [silence]
sw2303B-ms98-a-0063 445.586625 449.088250 well and some of the issues are so emotional
sw2303B-ms98-a-0064 449.088250 454.752750 you know some of the really the really emotional ones have you followed the Dallas elections on zoning
sw2303B-ms98-a-0065 454.752750 458.923250 [silence]
sw2303B-ms98-a-0066 458.923250 460.051000 i
sw2303B-ms98-a-0067 460.051000 463.981375 everyone has made so many statements i don't live in Dallas county
sw2303B-ms98-a-0068 463.981375 465.547875 but
sw2303B-ms98-a-0069 465.547875 468.849875 i've heard so many statements that i've lost track
sw2303B-ms98-a-0070 468.849875 472.063000 i honestly at this point
sw2303B-ms98-a-0071 472.063000 479.310875 it's it's just too blown out of proportion for everyone you really even the news you cannot follow
sw2303B-ms98-a-0072 479.310875 489.045500 what the sto[ry]- the actual facts are at this point i don't i don't really know if some of the poor judges that are just trying to decide how it should be divided
sw2303B-ms98-a-0073 489.045500 491.544250 i wonder about them at some point
sw2303B-ms98-a-0074 491.544250 493.754750 [silence]
sw2303B-ms98-a-0075 493.754750 495.662250 that's correct
sw2303B-ms98-a-0076 495.662250 502.339125 and that's an[other]- and that's another interesting question should judges be elected or appointed
sw2303B-ms98-a-0077 502.339125 505.133500 are they politicians
sw2303B-ms98-a-0078 505.133500 514.581500 [silence]
sw2303B-ms98-a-0079 514.581500 515.720250 sure
sw2303B-ms98-a-0080 515.720250 524.414125 or you want to take the other side of it you can argue that's one of those you can pick either side and we could spend a lot of time on it because
sw2303B-ms98-a-0081 524.414125 526.752375 it's it's difficult
sw2303B-ms98-a-0082 526.752375 528.589125 it's situational really
sw2303B-ms98-a-0083 528.589125 530.923625 [silence]
