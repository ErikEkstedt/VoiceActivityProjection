sw2375A-ms98-a-0002 0.288125 4.249250 good morning do you have a c[omputer]- a personal computer
sw2375A-ms98-a-0003 4.249250 15.137375 [silence]
sw2375A-ms98-a-0004 15.137375 16.940250 oh [laughter]
sw2375A-ms98-a-0005 16.940250 19.262000 [silence]
sw2375A-ms98-a-0006 19.262000 20.814250 um-hum
sw2375A-ms98-a-0007 20.814250 25.416250 [silence]
sw2375A-ms98-a-0008 25.416250 27.084750 um-hum
sw2375A-ms98-a-0009 27.084750 35.392500 um i have one uh a Wang or um sorry a Compaq portable that my son picked up at one point
sw2375A-ms98-a-0010 35.392500 39.607250 uh without documentation so it was very cheap it's a two eighty six
sw2375A-ms98-a-0011 39.607250 41.885625 so it has no hard drive
sw2375A-ms98-a-0012 41.885625 47.488750 um so that's limiting i tend to use it to log into the the mainframe at work
sw2375A-ms98-a-0013 47.488750 52.325500 and then i have a a Mac that i use for graphics and
sw2375A-ms98-a-0014 52.325500 53.674750 [silence]
sw2375A-ms98-a-0015 53.674750 67.609250 um i don't there's something about the Ma[c]- a lot of things about the Mac i don't like i don't like the size of the screen i have an old uh Plus i don't like the keyboard but i- it's extremely easy to use 
sw2375A-ms98-a-0016 67.609250 80.175125 and it's very good for for graphics and actually i- i mean it's to the point where programs are ea[sily]- readily available and inexpensive so i did my income tax on it
sw2375A-ms98-a-0017 80.175125 88.865625 i have um uh it's not really a budget package but a a financial tracking package you know for my checkbook and stuff like that
sw2375A-ms98-a-0018 88.865625 94.335500 [silence]
sw2375A-ms98-a-0019 94.335500 107.439625 right and i mean you can you can buy an extra screen [laughter] but but it's somehow because the screen comes with it it it always looks awkward to have the two screens
sw2375A-ms98-a-0020 107.439625 116.777875 and i found uh my son is um uh second year college student and he in high school had no interest in the computer at all
sw2375A-ms98-a-0021 116.777875 127.079625 and so he when teachers said you know you have to type your papers at least with a Mac he was willing to sit down and type his paper [laughter] and um [noise]
sw2375A-ms98-a-0022 127.079625 132.708625 [noise] now he does play with with the the you know IBM clone
sw2375A-ms98-a-0023 132.708625 145.512375 but um [noise] and has learned quite a bit about it and tends to use it instead of instead of instead of the Mac so even without any propaganda and stuff he he seems to have switched
sw2375A-ms98-a-0024 145.512375 151.893250 [silence]
sw2375A-ms98-a-0025 151.893250 155.576625 uh no i mean he sees it as a tool much as i do
sw2375A-ms98-a-0026 155.576625 159.550875 and um he no he's in international studies
sw2375A-ms98-a-0027 159.550875 160.609500 [silence]
sw2375A-ms98-a-0028 160.609500 171.399125 so he's basically you know what[ever]- whatever the computer can do for you fine i'll learn enough to to make it work well for me but i'm not gonna be a guru [laughter]
sw2375A-ms98-a-0029 171.399125 175.730500 [silence]
sw2375A-ms98-a-0030 175.730500 176.894375 um-hum
sw2375A-ms98-a-0031 176.894375 179.912750 [silence]

sw2375A-ms98-a-0033 181.215125 186.271500 [silence]
sw2375A-ms98-a-0034 186.271500 192.323750 but i think that is it is very frustrating because you know you're sure you did X
sw2375A-ms98-a-0035 192.323750 202.913250 and it just doesn't work and and so you tell somebody who knows about computers and they say no you obviously didn't do that because the computer doesn't [noise] doesn't balk [laughter]
sw2375A-ms98-a-0036 202.913250 207.888875 [silence]

sw2375A-ms98-a-0048 242.729625 245.708000 basically you're using it as a word processor you mean
sw2375A-ms98-a-0049 245.708000 252.013000 [silence]
sw2375A-ms98-a-0050 252.013000 257.316750 and what would you do [laughter]
