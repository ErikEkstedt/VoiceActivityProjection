sw2396A-ms98-a-0064 188.571250 193.640625 oh when i was growing up my folks we had fox terriers which are little bitty
sw2396A-ms98-a-0065 193.640625 195.581875 they weigh about ten pounds
sw2396A-ms98-a-0066 195.581875 198.617125 and so we had we had one for a long time
sw2396A-ms98-a-0067 198.617125 207.829000 and then oh gosh when i was about ten or eleven i guess my parents decided that dogs would be a good way to teach reproduction so then they went out and got a female [laughter]
sw2396A-ms98-a-0068 207.829000 210.817000 [laughter] and then we started having puppies and she had
sw2396A-ms98-a-0069 210.817000 217.063875 she had four or five litters she always had to look we always kept them in the house when they had the when she when the babies were little
sw2396A-ms98-a-0070 217.063875 225.118750 and the rest of the time they were outside they had a big we had a big uh kind of a play house and part of that was their dog house it was kind of cordoned off
sw2396A-ms98-a-0071 225.118750 233.348250 so they had a place to stay out there and then they had the yard and they had a little run that uh they kept them in when we were trying to do stuff in the back yard and didn't want them out
sw2396A-ms98-a-0072 233.348250 239.033875 but we had the same kind of situation at one point in time we had the mother the one of her last
sw2396A-ms98-a-0073 239.033875 244.502500 her next to last litter we kept we had one the one we never could get rid of
sw2396A-ms98-a-0074 244.502500 250.889500 he was a real dumb [laughter-dog] [laughter-nobody] [laughter-wanted] [laughter-him] the puppy was just one of these dogs just as dumb as a stick
sw2396A-ms98-a-0075 250.889500 252.232875 and we have him
sw2396A-ms98-a-0076 252.232875 257.582750 and then our female she had another litter we didn't think she was we thought she was too old to get pregnant again
sw2396A-ms98-a-0077 257.582750 259.087000 turned out she wasn't
sw2396A-ms98-a-0078 259.087000 262.579000 and uh she had her litter i guess her last litter had like
sw2396A-ms98-a-0079 262.579000 265.886250 four and two of them survived and then she didn't make it
sw2396A-ms98-a-0080 265.886250 269.426875 two days after the they were born she had a she died
sw2396A-ms98-a-0081 269.426875 272.683000 she had some kind of an infection from it all she was just too old
sw2396A-ms98-a-0082 272.683000 276.844375 we had to feed the puppies we had to get up night and day with those just like with a baby
sw2396A-ms98-a-0083 276.844375 278.644000 and fee[d]- and bottle feed them

sw2396A-ms98-a-0089 288.394875 291.968500 weren't they messy too well did she did the mother survive
sw2396A-ms98-a-0090 291.968500 295.367875 so you could still feed it but she kept them clean
sw2396A-ms98-a-0091 295.367875 298.015375 oh she didn't she didn't do something

sw2396A-ms98-a-0100 316.798500 318.136625 what's a mess
sw2396A-ms98-a-0101 318.136625 321.447875 [silence]
sw2396A-ms98-a-0102 321.447875 325.309875 that was like oh boy they are so messy when they're little too
sw2396A-ms98-a-0103 325.309875 330.382250 we were giving them a bath about every other d[ay]- boy we were giving them a bath at least once a day but they were so horrible
sw2396A-ms98-a-0104 330.382250 333.731875 because_1 they would roll and everything and oh
sw2396A-ms98-a-0105 333.731875 335.006875 [silence]

sw2396A-ms98-a-0107 336.442125 338.189875 [laughter-and] [laughter-crawl] [laughter-through] it [vocalized-noise]
sw2396A-ms98-a-0108 338.189875 339.409375 [laughter]
sw2396A-ms98-a-0109 339.409375 343.763625 oh i guess i had fish for a while when i was a kid too i had a fish tank
sw2396A-ms98-a-0110 343.763625 345.959000 and i had a few until
sw2396A-ms98-a-0111 345.959000 349.999750 well it wasn't really an aquarium it was an old you know how you used to have these um
sw2396A-ms98-a-0112 349.999750 361.139125 this was a box and it was originally it was it was made like an aquarium i guess except it was smaller but it was its original use was to put in the refrigerator on the shelf had a little spigot at one end
sw2396A-ms98-a-0113 361.139125 364.098500 and you could get water out of it you know keep cold water [laughter]
sw2396A-ms98-a-0114 364.098500 365.260125 [laughter]
sw2396A-ms98-a-0115 365.260125 366.748000 we outgrew the need for that
sw2396A-ms98-a-0116 366.748000 368.869500 and so i used it for an aquarium [laughter]
sw2396A-ms98-a-0117 368.869500 370.580250 [laughter]
sw2396A-ms98-a-0118 370.580250 372.681875 it worked except the fish could swim
sw2396A-ms98-a-0119 372.681875 378.437250 it wasn't tall enough i kept the if i didn't keep the the lid on it the fish would uh swim out and flop on the floor sometimes [laughter]
sw2396A-ms98-a-0120 378.437250 379.355500 [laughter]
sw2396A-ms98-a-0121 379.355500 380.954000 flip out of the thing but
sw2396A-ms98-a-0122 380.954000 382.491750 yeah
sw2396A-ms98-a-0123 382.491750 388.447375 those have been i mean and our dogs now our dogs with our kids i have two little kids three and a half and one and a half
sw2396A-ms98-a-0124 388.447375 391.850500 so we built the dog run down the length of our uh back yard
sw2396A-ms98-a-0125 391.850500 400.252375 because the kids were gettin[g]- i mean we couldn't even let our older son until he was about two i guess he was two when we built the dog run we couldn't let him go out in the back yard
sw2396A-ms98-a-0126 400.252375 406.122750 because it was we have a deck with a rail and he could go on that but the dogs were so big and he was so little
sw2396A-ms98-a-0127 406.122750 412.621625 you know they just even walking by him they'd kn[ock]- they'd knock him down and the whole the whole back yard had poop in it all the time
sw2396A-ms98-a-0128 412.621625 415.266125 it was a mess for the little one so
sw2396A-ms98-a-0129 415.266125 417.467375 now we have a back yard and a dog run
sw2396A-ms98-a-0130 417.467375 422.858750 [silence]
sw2396A-ms98-a-0131 422.858750 424.474625 oh that'll be nice
sw2396A-ms98-a-0132 424.474625 428.046250 [silence]
sw2396A-ms98-a-0133 428.046250 430.001500 yeah back and forth uh
sw2396A-ms98-a-0134 430.001500 438.066625 [silence]
sw2396A-ms98-a-0135 438.066625 439.231750 three and a half
sw2396A-ms98-a-0136 439.231750 440.086375 [silence]
sw2396A-ms98-a-0137 440.086375 441.376375 yeah
sw2396A-ms98-a-0138 441.376375 443.809000 [silence]
sw2396A-ms98-a-0139 443.809000 449.797000 or probably he or she is old enough to where they won't tease it too you know poke on it too much
sw2396A-ms98-a-0140 449.797000 451.633875 [silence]
sw2396A-ms98-a-0141 451.633875 453.243000 yeah
sw2396A-ms98-a-0142 453.243000 455.868250 because_1 that's hard ours our kids have gotten
sw2396A-ms98-a-0143 455.868250 459.926750 over it with the dogs behind it they have the the run it's kind of like a wire run
sw2396A-ms98-a-0144 459.926750 465.160125 so they go the first thing they do is they go out there and play with them but boy the little one still he just wants to poke
sw2396A-ms98-a-0145 465.160125 469.076125 my older one our older son's pretty good about it he'll pet the dog you [laughter-know]
sw2396A-ms98-a-0146 469.076125 475.872500 and and he's three and a half like you're saying and he he's pretty good with them and with other people's dogs and cats that he runs into
sw2396A-ms98-a-0147 475.872500 479.221125 but boy the little one still just wants to poke and
sw2396A-ms98-a-0148 479.221125 481.946250 and see if the dog will back off you know and
sw2396A-ms98-a-0149 481.946250 482.966250 [silence]
sw2396A-ms98-a-0150 482.966250 484.488875 yeah [laughter]
sw2396A-ms98-a-0151 484.488875 487.351500 yeah i think it is too it's gonna get better
sw2396A-ms98-a-0152 487.351500 488.868875 [laughter]
sw2396A-ms98-a-0153 488.868875 489.980250 yeah
sw2396A-ms98-a-0154 489.980250 491.623125 yeah
sw2396A-ms98-a-0155 491.623125 497.545875 i think if we didn't have pets if we didn't already have our dog and cat now we wouldn't get them because the kids are so little
sw2396A-ms98-a-0156 497.545875 502.671000 i think when they're really little like the the eighteen month old it's not fair to the animal
sw2396A-ms98-a-0157 502.671000 505.688750 because_1 the kids are so miserable to them [laughter]
sw2396A-ms98-a-0158 505.688750 507.782125 if they're out very much
sw2396A-ms98-a-0159 507.782125 511.018500 [silence]
