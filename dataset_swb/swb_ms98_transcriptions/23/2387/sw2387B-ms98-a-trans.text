sw2387B-ms98-a-0002 0.570000 2.579375 [silence]
sw2387B-ms98-a-0003 2.579375 16.197750 well i primarily listen to classical music when i have my druthers partly because i find it more soothing i don't know a lot about classical music so far as uh any background in music but it's the [vocalized-noise] the music i enjoy the most how about you
sw2387B-ms98-a-0004 16.197750 25.062125 [silence]
sw2387B-ms98-a-0005 25.062125 26.578250 right
sw2387B-ms98-a-0006 26.578250 28.173750 [silence]
sw2387B-ms98-a-0007 28.173750 29.669625 uh-huh
sw2387B-ms98-a-0008 29.669625 31.358500 [silence]
sw2387B-ms98-a-0009 31.358500 43.733000 i tend to listen to the classical music uh on the radio a lot there's uh one particular well there several stations in this area that play uh classical music all the time but there's one in particular that
sw2387B-ms98-a-0010 43.733000 55.524500 is on both AM and FM so i can listen to it without uh worrying it's cute though because my children when they get in the car and i have uh the button pushed for that they always switch it to something else [laughter]
sw2387B-ms98-a-0011 55.524500 58.438750 because_1 naturally that isn't their taste
sw2387B-ms98-a-0012 58.438750 61.060750 at this point in time anyway
sw2387B-ms98-a-0013 61.060750 63.659875 are are you involved in music
sw2387B-ms98-a-0014 63.659875 69.199500 [silence]
sw2387B-ms98-a-0015 69.199500 71.032125 [laughter]
sw2387B-ms98-a-0016 71.032125 78.793000 [laughter] well my whole family uh is somewhat musical um and not from training but just because we sing in our choir and
sw2387B-ms98-a-0017 78.793000 91.115250 my daughter's quite involved and all that sort of thing so um i think that one of these days maybe she'll get involved in classical music too because that's usually what happens if you unless you get into rock which isn't her voice style so
sw2387B-ms98-a-0018 91.115250 93.998000 [silence]
sw2387B-ms98-a-0019 93.998000 95.678375 [laughter]
sw2387B-ms98-a-0020 95.678375 101.779125 no i well most of it is not all that exciting in that it is terribly repetitious
sw2387B-ms98-a-0021 101.779125 113.391500 it's loud and repetitious without having a great deal of meaning now i do like folk song um and there have been some nice folk songs over the years that you know kind of still hang around
sw2387B-ms98-a-0022 113.391500 119.650875 but um but the more popular music i don't care for usually
sw2387B-ms98-a-0023 119.650875 133.253875 um even when i was a teenager i didn't really like the music of that period so much because i found i liked um a little bit more melodious music than what was often the popular
sw2387B-ms98-a-0024 133.253875 135.399125 rock and roll kind of thing
sw2387B-ms98-a-0025 135.399125 141.016625 although now i kind of enjoy hearing the rock and roll i guess it makes me think i'm young again [laughter]
sw2387B-ms98-a-0026 141.016625 143.080375 [silence]
sw2387B-ms98-a-0027 143.080375 151.088750 isn't that the truth it's funny in fact it's interesting to me that so many of the songs now i grew up
sw2387B-ms98-a-0028 151.088750 159.418625 in the late fifties and early sixties and so much of the music that was popular at that time has come back
sw2387B-ms98-a-0029 159.418625 166.886500 and you you don't hear everything all the time but you hear much of the same music perhaps a new version of it but it's the same stuff
sw2387B-ms98-a-0030 166.886500 175.767250 um which is always kind of funny um and i remember my older sister i have a sister who's sixteen years older and at the time that i was
sw2387B-ms98-a-0031 175.767250 183.869375 a teenager late teenager i guess i can't remember the year Smoke Gets In Your Eyes became popular i think it was done by maybe the Platters or something
sw2387B-ms98-a-0032 183.869375 198.251250 then and she laughed and she said well you know when i was a teenager that had been you know some years before she said that was a a version of you know a song then and she said it's very similar but they've changed a little bit she said i like the original version better 
sw2387B-ms98-a-0033 198.251250 205.770375 well they did it again about [laughter] [laughter-two] [laughter-or] [laughter-three] [laughter-years] [laughter-ago] and i laughed again i said oh no here we are [laughter]
sw2387B-ms98-a-0034 205.770375 208.827125 right right it does indeed
sw2387B-ms98-a-0035 208.827125 212.180875 [silence]
sw2387B-ms98-a-0036 212.180875 213.571750 uh-huh
sw2387B-ms98-a-0037 213.571750 214.581000 [silence]
sw2387B-ms98-a-0038 214.581000 224.676250 yes now that there there's some wonderful Christian music when you can find good stations uh the pro[blem]- problem that i found um in this area is that the
sw2387B-ms98-a-0039 224.676250 227.626375 there there is inconsistency in the quality
sw2387B-ms98-a-0040 227.626375 240.300250 here if you get someone who's very good at selecting it's okay but sometimes they kind of get on a a a binge and they they play the same sort of thing over and over again without really necessarily quality 
sw2387B-ms98-a-0041 240.300250 245.845000 you know uh i live in the uh Washington DC area Rockville Maryland 
sw2387B-ms98-a-0042 245.845000 250.883875 [silence]
sw2387B-ms98-a-0043 250.883875 253.071375 yeah [vocalized-noise] and it
sw2387B-ms98-a-0044 253.071375 254.088375 [silence]
sw2387B-ms98-a-0045 254.088375 260.589250 uh-huh and i i you know there's so much available that i don't understand why they do that but um
sw2387B-ms98-a-0046 260.589250 270.490125 now my children have have sometimes um well they've gone to a few of the concerts and so on of Christian musicians that come for our youth group at our church and um and
sw2387B-ms98-a-0047 270.490125 277.731000 the[y]- when they buy a tape or something sometimes that's fun because it's different and something i've not always heard and you know i enjoy that
sw2387B-ms98-a-0048 277.731000 284.024625 [silence]
sw2387B-ms98-a-0049 284.024625 286.304250 oh wow
sw2387B-ms98-a-0050 286.304250 289.817000 yeah that's nice so is your husband a singer
sw2387B-ms98-a-0051 289.817000 294.153000 [silence]

sw2387B-ms98-a-0053 296.321250 298.359500 well that's a good thing to do
sw2387B-ms98-a-0054 298.359500 301.361625 [silence]
sw2387B-ms98-a-0055 301.361625 304.661250 that's nice uh well do you have children
sw2387B-ms98-a-0056 304.661250 306.160750 [silence]
sw2387B-ms98-a-0057 306.160750 309.839750 well wonderful that'll be a musician
sw2387B-ms98-a-0058 309.839750 311.428375 [silence]
sw2387B-ms98-a-0059 311.428375 315.946250 [laughter] oh there's some wonderful Christian uh children's tapes
sw2387B-ms98-a-0060 315.946250 328.180500 you can uh you can get and i know when my children were younger um we found a lot of really nice tapes that they that they liked um there was an Agape music group and um
sw2387B-ms98-a-0061 328.180500 334.727125 i some of the songs i still find going over in my head over and over again because they were really um
sw2387B-ms98-a-0062 334.727125 345.432750 very memorable even though my children are now my youngest is almost sixteen but i still find some of the same tapes i uh some of the same songs from those tapes i enjoy
sw2387B-ms98-a-0063 345.432750 350.579250 um there's one that's um a little girl singing Practice Makes Perfect
sw2387B-ms98-a-0064 350.579250 363.719500 and uh she's playing the piano and so she she gets the wrong note every now and then but then she keeps repeating it practice makes perfect and then you know talking about that so far as Christian life too and it's really cute
sw2387B-ms98-a-0065 363.719500 365.319875 yeah
sw2387B-ms98-a-0066 365.319875 372.833250 [silence]
sw2387B-ms98-a-0067 372.833250 374.905125 yeah right
sw2387B-ms98-a-0068 374.905125 376.034500 [silence]
sw2387B-ms98-a-0069 376.034500 380.999750 yeah well do you know something because i have always played classical music
sw2387B-ms98-a-0070 380.999750 388.346500 uh or classical style it's not always classical as you know the official uh word might go but um
sw2387B-ms98-a-0071 388.346500 398.581375 even when i was pregnant of course i listened to that and when our first child was you know an infant um of course i [vocalized-noise] when i was around the house i played that music too 
sw2387B-ms98-a-0072 398.581375 405.246750 when he first made sounds that you could detect they were in the scale the music scale
sw2387B-ms98-a-0073 405.246750 416.804000 someone else noticed it and i said well i guess that's true and it was somewhat melodious in other words it wasn't just you know it was really funny [laughter]
sw2387B-ms98-a-0074 416.804000 424.132750 right right i do think there is probably an influence there because i noticed that even though popular music
sw2387B-ms98-a-0075 424.132750 436.862000 the the wilder stuff was around when my uh older children were were you know adolescents early adolescents when they first start listening to music on their own they first get ask for a radio of their own and so on um
sw2387B-ms98-a-0076 436.862000 444.513125 this same child um really listened t[o]- to more um {ballady} or um
sw2387B-ms98-a-0077 444.513125 451.600875 pleasant sort of songs rather than and even classical rather than the uh real hard rock stuff that so many other kids listen to 
sw2387B-ms98-a-0078 451.600875 458.046500 and i i never i didn't want to say too much for fear he would think it was wrong and wouldn't do it anymore [laughter]
sw2387B-ms98-a-0079 458.046500 464.860375 right [laughter] but uh but i must say they all kind of like a variety of music which is nice i like that
sw2387B-ms98-a-0080 464.860375 466.310750 yeah
sw2387B-ms98-a-0081 466.310750 468.873875 [silence]
