sw2344A-ms98-a-0008 21.221500 22.237750 [noise]
sw2344A-ms98-a-0009 22.237750 27.082500 okay um do you think that the Soviet Union represents a threat to us
sw2344A-ms98-a-0010 27.082500 50.801250 [silence]
sw2344A-ms98-a-0011 50.801250 56.363750 yeah that's interesting i don't i- i suspect they're not our biggest threat anymore
sw2344A-ms98-a-0012 56.363750 59.814625 i suspect it's probably some crazy man like Saddam Hussein
sw2344A-ms98-a-0013 59.814625 69.301250 who's our biggest threat but um i wonder if they're i wonder how much of a threat they are i agree with you that that they'll always be somewhat of a threat given that they have that there's just
sw2344A-ms98-a-0014 69.301250 73.469625 it's just so big and there's just so much military machine there
sw2344A-ms98-a-0015 73.469625 76.480375 [silence]
sw2344A-ms98-a-0016 76.480375 77.866000 right
sw2344A-ms98-a-0017 77.866000 81.440000 [silence]
sw2344A-ms98-a-0018 81.440000 84.224250 but i wonder how much longer they're going to be a them
sw2344A-ms98-a-0019 84.224250 85.415375 huh
sw2344A-ms98-a-0020 85.415375 86.392000 that's
sw2344A-ms98-a-0021 86.392000 87.634250 [silence]
sw2344A-ms98-a-0022 87.634250 89.073750 yeah uh
sw2344A-ms98-a-0023 89.073750 94.366875 [silence]
sw2344A-ms98-a-0024 94.366875 101.523500 yeah oh i agree i mean if we were to if if something were to happen i'm sure they would all of a sudden band together just for the sake of
sw2344A-ms98-a-0025 101.523500 108.453750 for the sake of uh of of unity against us or something if if if need be but
sw2344A-ms98-a-0026 108.453750 127.017250 [silence]
sw2344A-ms98-a-0027 127.017250 132.683875 yeah actually i noticed that i mean th[is]- th[is]- this this most recent scam of his where he said
sw2344A-ms98-a-0028 132.683875 136.130625 where where he just decided that instead of having uh
sw2344A-ms98-a-0029 136.130625 137.864125 instead of having
sw2344A-ms98-a-0030 137.864125 140.504750 i c[an't]- i can't think of the word now um
sw2344A-ms98-a-0031 140.504750 147.160125 if they're having demonstrations for in in favor of Boris Yeltsin he decided well i'll just cancel all demonstrations altogether
sw2344A-ms98-a-0032 147.160125 152.217375 so i- i- i think that he he he's actually he i think is becoming very dangerous
sw2344A-ms98-a-0033 152.217375 157.469125 because he's making those people angry at him and he's also i think he's also making
sw2344A-ms98-a-0034 157.469125 161.795125 um the military angry at him i mean i've heard stories now where the
sw2344A-ms98-a-0035 161.795125 166.548250 where the um the military is running around and they're sort of getting restless
sw2344A-ms98-a-0036 166.548250 172.046000 and a restless military is the kind of thing that happens you know with with the Baltic States when they just go in there
sw2344A-ms98-a-0037 172.046000 174.010000 to beat people up
sw2344A-ms98-a-0038 174.010000 185.545625 [silence]
sw2344A-ms98-a-0039 185.545625 186.471000 um-hum
sw2344A-ms98-a-0040 186.471000 193.964875 [silence]
sw2344A-ms98-a-0041 193.964875 195.796500 that's interesting
sw2344A-ms98-a-0042 195.796500 199.686000 i- i wonder i don't know if he's he he seems
sw2344A-ms98-a-0043 199.686000 204.918625 the thing about Gorbachev strikes me that he wouldn't be that dumb [laughter] i don't know though
sw2344A-ms98-a-0044 204.918625 210.105375 [silence]
sw2344A-ms98-a-0045 210.105375 224.075875 that's that that's that's something that really true that may sort of that military thing i was speaking of before i think that's that's certainly true i mean his military may just go out and say well we just Gorbachev said you can't do it and we're just not going to let you do it you know so
sw2344A-ms98-a-0046 224.075875 231.520000 yeah that that's real scary actually i mean i- i would suspect their own problems would keep them away from us for awhile but
sw2344A-ms98-a-0047 231.520000 233.785875 it could be real dangerous
sw2344A-ms98-a-0048 233.785875 237.500500 yeah right we don't need to worry about them
sw2344A-ms98-a-0049 237.500500 243.248375 [silence]
sw2344A-ms98-a-0050 243.248375 247.291625 yes but wouldn't it be nice if no one had to fight anybody else
sw2344A-ms98-a-0051 247.291625 251.002250 [silence]
sw2344A-ms98-a-0052 251.002250 252.142125 yes
sw2344A-ms98-a-0053 252.142125 257.700375 [silence]
sw2344A-ms98-a-0054 257.700375 262.220000 well i don't i don't know i think that un[derlying]- un[derlying]- underlying we're all pretty
sw2344A-ms98-a-0055 262.220000 265.729000 probably not as as different as everybody thinks
sw2344A-ms98-a-0056 265.729000 269.549125 [silence]
sw2344A-ms98-a-0057 269.549125 272.805750 right well that's that's certainly true i just
sw2344A-ms98-a-0058 272.805750 280.749875 [silence]
sw2344A-ms98-a-0059 280.749875 288.166250 that's true i was i was discussing with someone before um this uh someone before actually one of these calls
sw2344A-ms98-a-0060 288.166250 289.963125 as a matter of fact about um
sw2344A-ms98-a-0061 289.963125 292.676625 another topic but it came up under these um
sw2344A-ms98-a-0062 292.676625 297.545750 this this this poem Everything I Wanted to Know I Learned in Kindergarten or something
sw2344A-ms98-a-0063 297.545750 299.085625 you've read that one before
sw2344A-ms98-a-0064 299.085625 300.370250 [silence]
sw2344A-ms98-a-0065 300.370250 306.125625 that this this is the idea that i think is actually very is is what i think we should all revert to
sw2344A-ms98-a-0066 306.125625 313.490875 the idea that um basically they said you know everything happened in kindergarten and and in kindergarten we learned to share
sw2344A-ms98-a-0067 313.490875 322.713000 and we learned to um play with each other we learned to take nap you know and to take naps and and whenever we'd start a fight we'd all apologize and hug each other
sw2344A-ms98-a-0068 322.713000 326.087250 you know and and that would be all and if we could just do the same thing
sw2344A-ms98-a-0069 326.087250 330.203875 sort of with with with everybody else i suspect we'd we'd be fine
sw2344A-ms98-a-0070 330.203875 332.227625 [silence]
sw2344A-ms98-a-0071 332.227625 334.060750 yeah unfortunately
sw2344A-ms98-a-0072 334.060750 336.858375 because_1 because i often i often sort of wonder how
sw2344A-ms98-a-0073 336.858375 344.809000 having never been to the Soviet Union um how different the people there really are you know h[ow]- how mu[ch]- everyone always thought of them as you know sort of the
sw2344A-ms98-a-0074 344.809000 347.840875 [silence]
sw2344A-ms98-a-0075 347.840875 349.986375 [laughter] yeah
sw2344A-ms98-a-0076 349.986375 363.014500 [silence]
sw2344A-ms98-a-0077 363.014500 364.759750 right
sw2344A-ms98-a-0078 364.759750 368.136375 [silence]
sw2344A-ms98-a-0079 368.136375 377.395500 i would i would love to go there i mean like a[gain]- again not now but at some point to go see what what i mean what this is like i mean this this is amazing because_1 this is 
sw2344A-ms98-a-0080 377.395500 384.800000 this is an an i mean this is an example of an entirely different culture that wants to be like us like you said before as well so it'd be interesting to watch
sw2344A-ms98-a-0081 384.800000 398.928500 [silence]
sw2344A-ms98-a-0082 398.928500 402.877125 yeah that's that's and and the ones they even feel
sw2344A-ms98-a-0083 402.877125 407.335500 somewhat worse for even um the ones in like the Baltic States
sw2344A-ms98-a-0084 407.335500 417.166875 where they don't have a strong leader that you know at least at least Russia has some sort of strong leader i mean they have Yeltsin who may who may yet sort of help Russia
sw2344A-ms98-a-0085 417.166875 424.545500 but um i mean the Baltic States i think are just sort of trapped i mean they were taken over couple of you know not too long ago
sw2344A-ms98-a-0086 424.545500 428.089500 and then just sort of told well you're here now you're part of our country and
sw2344A-ms98-a-0087 428.089500 430.085125 you be this way
sw2344A-ms98-a-0088 430.085125 433.511250 uh i- i think it's a sad state of affairs but
sw2344A-ms98-a-0089 433.511250 448.419375 [silence]
sw2344A-ms98-a-0090 448.419375 450.883125 oh yeah the yeah

sw2344A-ms98-a-0092 457.142000 458.438875 um-hum

sw2344A-ms98-a-0097 469.793750 471.929125 yeah well that yeah and that
sw2344A-ms98-a-0098 471.929125 479.858125 [silence]
sw2344A-ms98-a-0099 479.858125 488.931500 um um [vocalized-noise] actually it sounds very i mean very similar they're sort of being they were sort of forced and now they just want to sort of speak up and say hey we want our piece
sw2344A-ms98-a-0100 488.931500 492.546625 and they have other problems they have Shiite Muslims to deal with
sw2344A-ms98-a-0101 492.546625 499.021875 as well as Saddam Hussein i- i mean i think their big problem up there is that they you know is unfortunately not only are they
sw2344A-ms98-a-0102 499.021875 507.929625 th[ere]- there's more than one group fighting for the same place where they all want you know whereas the Baltics are saying well we want our own we just want this little tiny piece of land
sw2344A-ms98-a-0103 507.929625 517.747125 [silence]

sw2344A-ms98-a-0108 532.285250 536.160125 um-hum um actually uh my wife is Syrian
sw2344A-ms98-a-0109 536.160125 539.604625 um so i- i also i know some of the history and so forth
sw2344A-ms98-a-0110 539.604625 545.112125 and and the actually the real funny thing is that i'm i'm i'm Jewish we're sort of like the Middle East peace talks ourselves
sw2344A-ms98-a-0111 545.112125 551.536375 so we i- i know that and i've been to Israel and i know and i sort of toured the area and i know that it really is very
sw2344A-ms98-a-0112 551.536375 560.217500 lots of different cultures in one place i mean and and it's the same thing i it's it's almost the same thing out out in the Soviet Union right now there you know there are
sw2344A-ms98-a-0113 560.217500 566.713000 you can't take a whole bunch of people who just aren't the same people and don't want to be together and put them_1 together forcibly
sw2344A-ms98-a-0114 566.713000 572.355250 i mean we did it couple of hundred years ago here but they wanted to do it
sw2344A-ms98-a-0115 572.355250 574.008375 so i could put the
sw2344A-ms98-a-0116 574.008375 577.176750 [silence]
sw2344A-ms98-a-0117 577.176750 579.342375 that's that's certainly true

sw2344A-ms98-a-0119 582.621375 584.450750 right um
sw2344A-ms98-a-0120 584.450750 590.840125 i wonder i wonder if now the people in the Soviet Union don't have ideas very different from that so at least
