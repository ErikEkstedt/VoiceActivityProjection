sw2344B-ms98-a-0016 30.646000 34.078750 whether or not there's an active cold war or not
sw2344B-ms98-a-0017 34.078750 43.910125 uh it's it's a a totally different economy based on different beliefs and and uh different priorities
sw2344B-ms98-a-0018 43.910125 45.553000 and
sw2344B-ms98-a-0019 45.553000 51.554250 uh given the the uh military powers on both sides i think it's always a threat

sw2344B-ms98-a-0030 106.365000 107.543000 yeah

sw2344B-ms98-a-0032 114.542375 127.508375 things that we have that they're not allowed i mean just some basic freedoms and and their government is not allowing it and Gorbachev seems to be going back on some of the things that he's been trying to push
sw2344B-ms98-a-0033 127.508375 146.385125 [silence]

sw2344B-ms98-a-0042 173.764250 185.689375 see i'm concerned that that since he's banned demonstrations altogether that he's going to do the type of thing that happened in Tiananmen Square and he's going to wipe out no telling how many of his
sw2344B-ms98-a-0043 185.689375 194.576375 own countrymen uh right in the middle of Red Square and uh it's going to cause a more civil war than is already occurring
sw2344B-ms98-a-0044 194.576375 204.535125 [silence]
sw2344B-ms98-a-0045 204.535125 210.192875 i don't know i mean and it it might be something that he wouldn't be able to control
sw2344B-ms98-a-0046 210.192875 215.117625 [silence]

sw2344B-ms98-a-0054 235.505625 236.825875 [silence]
sw2344B-ms98-a-0055 236.825875 243.721875 i guess as long as as uh they're fighting each other we don't have to worry about them wasting their time with us
sw2344B-ms98-a-0056 243.721875 246.787250 [silence]
sw2344B-ms98-a-0057 246.787250 251.271250 well sure that but that's a that's an impossibility i think
sw2344B-ms98-a-0058 251.271250 257.688000 given the the uh the differences in the world and people are just too different
sw2344B-ms98-a-0059 257.688000 265.859625 [silence]
sw2344B-ms98-a-0060 265.859625 269.979375 but unfortunately people people aren't that insightful

sw2344B-ms98-a-0062 271.604625 273.422625 they just see that
sw2344B-ms98-a-0063 273.422625 281.420125 this guy prays differently and to someone else than i do so therefore he's wrong and he's bad and we have to wipe wipe him out

sw2344B-ms98-a-0065 287.737500 288.493750 um-hum

sw2344B-ms98-a-0074 344.346375 353.496250 that's one of the places i would most like to go not right now of course but at at some point i would like to to go to Moscow and and
sw2344B-ms98-a-0075 353.496250 365.702750 to just to see all these things that you can can see on television now and can read about that ten years ago we didn't have this kind of information i mean we didn't know
sw2344B-ms98-a-0076 365.702750 367.578250 what things were like
sw2344B-ms98-a-0077 367.578250 368.585625 so

sw2344B-ms98-a-0089 433.022375 440.241000 it's it's probably not dissimilar from the uh what are they the the the
sw2344B-ms98-a-0090 440.241000 448.604250 i'm trying to think of the name of the the [vocalized-noise] something like that in Northern Iraq
sw2344B-ms98-a-0091 448.604250 459.304500 who are actually who are actually countrymen of of i mean some of them were split off into Israel i believe and some of them are in Turkey when actually
sw2344B-ms98-a-0092 459.304500 469.389750 they they don't they're their own people and their own beliefs and their own culture system and they were split up into three different countries
sw2344B-ms98-a-0093 469.389750 475.251625 and and they're very dissatisfied and they're they're causing wars right now and
sw2344B-ms98-a-0094 475.251625 481.050375 and i don't think it's that different from what the Baltic States are are going through
sw2344B-ms98-a-0095 481.050375 488.623875 [silence]

sw2344B-ms98-a-0103 508.005750 510.016500 the the one that i think
sw2344B-ms98-a-0104 510.016500 524.217250 one of the wom[en]- women that i work for is married to an Iranian and so she has a lot of insight because she knows a lot of the history of the the countries over there and within five or six countries there are
sw2344B-ms98-a-0105 524.217250 533.455625 probably ten cultures of people and and that's they don't all have their own country and and some of them_1 are [laughter-mad] [laughter-about] [laughter-it]
