sw2326A-ms98-a-0008 12.392375 13.658375 [silence]
sw2326A-ms98-a-0009 13.658375 14.883875 oh
sw2326A-ms98-a-0010 14.883875 19.760250 [silence]
sw2326A-ms98-a-0011 19.760250 22.499000 you couldn't couldn't find an American built car
sw2326A-ms98-a-0012 22.499000 26.921250 [silence]
sw2326A-ms98-a-0013 26.921250 28.250375 huh
sw2326A-ms98-a-0014 28.250375 37.353000 [silence]
sw2326A-ms98-a-0015 37.353000 38.784625 i'll be darned
sw2326A-ms98-a-0016 38.784625 39.639375 [silence]
sw2326A-ms98-a-0017 39.639375 43.006250 i've had pretty much the i've had pretty much the opposite experience
sw2326A-ms98-a-0018 43.006250 52.850875 yeah i generally drive a a large Ford super cab you know like one fifty or something and the one time i traded and got something different i got a little Datsun uh king cab
sw2326A-ms98-a-0019 52.850875 56.749500 it didn't last eighteen months i had had more trouble with that
sw2326A-ms98-a-0020 56.749500 66.878500 [silence]
sw2326A-ms98-a-0021 66.878500 79.117375 yeah i that's that's probably true i'm getting ready to i think i'm going to trade off the super cab and i'm considering going with either one of those four door S10 Blazers a four door Explorer or four door Jeep
sw2326A-ms98-a-0022 79.117375 81.562500 but i can't decide which one
sw2326A-ms98-a-0023 81.562500 83.218500 [silence]
sw2326A-ms98-a-0024 83.218500 94.022375 yeah that's about the only thing to do i'm just i i'm looking for uh fuel economy and and durability and i've got to have some high road clearance we got some property and i need to get out in the pasture a lot 
sw2326A-ms98-a-0025 94.022375 100.735625 but i don't need to haul a pickup as much haul around stuff in the pickup as much as i used to we got an old one there at the ranch we use now
sw2326A-ms98-a-0026 100.735625 109.307000 but i just got to have something i can get out in the field and of course that truck is only getting like eight to ten miles a gallon maybe twelve on a good day and that just kills me
sw2326A-ms98-a-0027 109.307000 112.168125 especially a dollar a gallon or more for gas
sw2326A-ms98-a-0028 112.168125 115.856625 [silence]
sw2326A-ms98-a-0029 115.856625 123.500000 well those small ones uh those little bitty ones i'm going to go with the small one with the two wheel drive i don't really i i haven't had a use for four wheel drive tell you the truth
sw2326A-ms98-a-0030 123.500000 132.799000 they say they're getting eighteen to twenty in them_1 yeah i've got a friend of mine's got a uh he bought a four door Jeep with the {positrack} rear end instead of the four wheel drive
sw2326A-ms98-a-0031 132.799000 136.920500 he's getting sixteen to eighteen in town and twenty to twenty two on the road
sw2326A-ms98-a-0032 136.920500 144.747000 no he's not really and he's not he said he's pretty heavy footed he's clipping along at sixty five or so around there when he can get away with it
sw2326A-ms98-a-0033 144.747000 147.732250 so i think i could probably stand you know twice the gas mileage
sw2326A-ms98-a-0034 147.732250 156.310625 it wouldn't hurt my feelings a bit i just don't know if i could stand one that small because i'm fairly large and i've always driven a truck or something
sw2326A-ms98-a-0035 156.310625 158.240750 i don't know
sw2326A-ms98-a-0036 158.240750 160.809625 [silence]
sw2326A-ms98-a-0037 160.809625 173.083625 they don't look too bad i just you know i i have have to get in one to find out i just don't know if i could stand you know being cooped up my wife's got uh three old cars of hers she's never sold a car she's bought
sw2326A-ms98-a-0038 173.083625 176.696000 she has thirty nine Chevy a fifty three and a sixty seven
sw2326A-ms98-a-0039 176.696000 183.878375 and anytime i drive any of those i just you know it's like being in a coffin i just feel hemmed in i've got to have something fairly large
sw2326A-ms98-a-0040 183.878375 184.883375 [silence]
sw2326A-ms98-a-0041 184.883375 193.789375 but i think prob[ably]- probably my whole problem is going to be trying to find something that will that will blend you know uh fuel economy and and price and uh durability
sw2326A-ms98-a-0042 193.789375 198.168375 you know the little those smaller trucks
sw2326A-ms98-a-0043 198.168375 199.909750 yeah i know that's
sw2326A-ms98-a-0044 199.909750 203.246000 i think it would be fun if you didn't have to pay for the repairs to it
sw2326A-ms98-a-0045 203.246000 204.250000 [silence]
sw2326A-ms98-a-0046 204.250000 209.673875 but that's what they don't show you when they get you know when they get them off they show them jumping up and down hills and like that but they don't show you the repairs
sw2326A-ms98-a-0047 209.673875 213.073375 you know the front ends impossible to line up on mine
sw2326A-ms98-a-0048 213.073375 216.774750 last time i lined my Ford front end up it cost me a hundred and ten dollars
sw2326A-ms98-a-0049 216.774750 217.997875 [silence]
sw2326A-ms98-a-0050 217.997875 219.503250 so i don't know
sw2326A-ms98-a-0051 219.503250 221.246500 [silence]
sw2326A-ms98-a-0052 221.246500 225.463750 how you getting gas mileage in your Mazda have you had it long enough to know
sw2326A-ms98-a-0053 225.463750 235.506375 [silence]
sw2326A-ms98-a-0054 235.506375 240.615125 you do most of your driving you do most of your driving in the city you do most of your driving in the city 
sw2326A-ms98-a-0055 240.615125 251.383250 [silence]

sw2326A-ms98-a-0057 261.506250 262.716875 [silence]
sw2326A-ms98-a-0058 262.716875 266.507500 he just he just lives out there he makes his living on the road out there
sw2326A-ms98-a-0059 266.507500 267.703375 [silence]

sw2326A-ms98-a-0066 292.751875 295.057500 you can get a sunroof a lot cheaper
sw2326A-ms98-a-0067 295.057500 297.067125 it's probably more functional
sw2326A-ms98-a-0068 297.067125 301.972625 i don't think i had a convertible once in college and it was fun when you know during the warm months
sw2326A-ms98-a-0069 301.972625 305.710500 but God it was miserable during the winter i don't care what they say
sw2326A-ms98-a-0070 305.710500 310.588750 [silence]
