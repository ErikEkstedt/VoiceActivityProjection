sw2368A-ms98-a-0017 52.924250 56.050625 they're almost five hundred a month for a one bedroom place
sw2368A-ms98-a-0018 56.050625 61.888375 yeah it does considering that you know you uh house payments are not a whole lot more than that
sw2368A-ms98-a-0019 61.888375 71.923625 [silence]
sw2368A-ms98-a-0020 71.923625 72.879375 yeah

sw2368A-ms98-a-0054 199.677125 206.354250 well you know a lot of these people that i've talked to that are coming down from uh like what i call the back East especially from JC Penney
sw2368A-ms98-a-0055 206.354250 213.164250 uh are selling two and three hundred thousand dollar houses up there and buying a hundred and fifty hundred and seventy five thousand dollar houses down here
sw2368A-ms98-a-0056 213.164250 216.389875 and they've wind up getting better houses here than they had there
sw2368A-ms98-a-0057 216.389875 219.429625 so in a way i guess it works both ways you know
sw2368A-ms98-a-0058 219.429625 224.582125 [silence]
sw2368A-ms98-a-0059 224.582125 225.764500 yeah

sw2368A-ms98-a-0127 468.914250 479.003625 oh yeah because you're combine uh confined by space you know i had a i came out of a thirty one hundred square foot two story h[ouse]- house and i had room for everything
sw2368A-ms98-a-0128 479.003625 486.510750 in fact i had more room than i knew what to do with i don't know it's it's seems like room uh stuff always expands to fill a[vailable]- available space but

sw2368A-ms98-a-0133 496.830875 498.654875 it's not as bad as i thought it was
sw2368A-ms98-a-0134 498.654875 503.463125 uh it's not as bad as i remembered especially going to college and living in apartments there you know how noisy that can be
sw2368A-ms98-a-0135 503.463125 516.466250 uh there seems to be a a more a mature crowd in uh apartments at least where i am uh even though you know there's kids all around and there's there's traffic and there's people going up and down the sidewalks and stuff like that but still uh
sw2368A-ms98-a-0136 516.466250 518.633125 [silence]
sw2368A-ms98-a-0137 518.633125 531.328000 yeah pretty much and uh there's never really any any oh i remember in school there's just seem like there was a fight or a party or something going on every night you don't run into that up here i think i think because there's so many uh professional people if you want to call them_1 that
sw2368A-ms98-a-0138 531.328000 535.039750 uh that go spend all day at work and they want to come home and they want some quiet
sw2368A-ms98-a-0139 535.039750 541.704375 yeah yeah [vocalized-noise] you see a lot of activity outside people riding bikes or playing ball or jogging or doing this and that
sw2368A-ms98-a-0140 541.704375 544.192000 and uh they're trying to to unwind

sw2368A-ms98-a-0148 575.968875 585.326125 oh you bet and the thing that that gets me is uh you never really catch up you never really finish doing things and uh
sw2368A-ms98-a-0149 585.326125 587.790500 you're always paying for something you know
