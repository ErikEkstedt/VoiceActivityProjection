sw2368B-ms98-a-0018 59.625750 72.686250 yeah i was going to say our mortgage is is between depending on you know it it drops um seems like in the last six months we um got lucky and we refinanced and it but it was like eight hundred and something but it went down to like seven hundred and twenty
sw2368B-ms98-a-0019 72.686250 82.742625 so that's really not i have friends that pay about nine hundred dollars for a townhouse in yeah in actually they're near Plano in North Dallas too but i couldn't believe it but you know
sw2368B-ms98-a-0020 82.742625 85.714750 [silence]

sw2368B-ms98-a-0022 87.555625 97.658000 and then i think that um nobody was really buying homes for a long time there because of just i mean we've been in ours for about ten years but uh there's no investment in it you know
sw2368B-ms98-a-0023 97.658000 100.322625 all it allows you to do is itemize [laughter]
sw2368B-ms98-a-0024 100.322625 101.372875 on your
sw2368B-ms98-a-0025 101.372875 106.431125 on your taxes yeah that's really about it it's uh have you ever owned your own home

sw2368B-ms98-a-0029 119.750875 122.585250 yeah suburban track yeah
sw2368B-ms98-a-0030 122.585250 131.631750 we uh we lived out of state for a while and came back and uh we lived in a smaller city and now we say gee Dallas really is big and polluted [laughter]

sw2368B-ms98-a-0034 141.624250 152.916375 yeah it's really it's really sad because they're they're not doing anything well we're getting off the subject i guess but just like with housing i mean they're not doing anything about pollution they're not doing anything about it's going to look like Hou[ston]- have you ever been to Houston
sw2368B-ms98-a-0035 152.916375 161.670250 you know um i used to think Dallas was better than Houston because_1 their zoning for where you can put a house next to a now it looks just like Houston to me you know
sw2368B-ms98-a-0036 161.670250 163.987875 we've been in here ten years
sw2368B-ms98-a-0037 163.987875 169.367750 yeah so we've got you know we've got some investment in it but you really don't get anything out of it

sw2368B-ms98-a-0041 180.166000 187.203000 actually a lot better because_1 Pittsburgh is about the size i'm trying to think like a Louisville or Minneapolis that type of size
sw2368B-ms98-a-0042 187.203000 192.525750 and the prices what you get here for about a hundred thousand you could get there for about seventy five eighty
sw2368B-ms98-a-0043 192.525750 199.303500 yeah it's really and we didn't think it was that clean but then after you're gone [laughter-for] [laughter-a] [laughter-while] it looks cleaner you know
sw2368B-ms98-a-0044 199.303500 200.491625 um

sw2368B-ms98-a-0051 225.098625 234.883125 and a lot of the people that came from that area probably like what you're talking about they had no um they had a lot of property but not a lot of house and now they have a lot of house and hardly any yardage around it
sw2368B-ms98-a-0052 234.883125 242.516625 but but they love it i mean they they they think that they're getting you know you say um sun room to them and you enclose and you can sell [laughter]

sw2368B-ms98-a-0125 543.524500 549.035750 and i think Plano in general is getting a little more well it's gotten so big it's almost a town in it's own right
sw2368B-ms98-a-0126 549.035750 550.456750 [silence]
sw2368B-ms98-a-0127 550.456750 553.674625 isn't that something yeah the price of home now we paid
sw2368B-ms98-a-0128 553.674625 561.070125 oh we paid um about seventy eight nine for our house like i said about a decade ago not even about nine years ago and
sw2368B-ms98-a-0129 561.070125 565.073375 i'd say they appraised it it's gone up you now maybe like five percent
sw2368B-ms98-a-0130 565.073375 576.474750 so it's an investment but it's something that you know when you're first married or starting out you think if you really have something but you really it's just real nowadays with the way income tax i think housing is strictly to itemize
sw2368B-ms98-a-0131 576.474750 584.527500 [silence]
sw2368B-ms98-a-0132 584.527500 586.657875 yeah exactly we
sw2368B-ms98-a-0133 586.657875 599.101500 yeah and even you know i mean like we had i called them prefabs just a track home you know i mean we we had one of their homes that was nicer in Pennsylvania but um it was an older home but then you buy an older home and you're always fixing things up
sw2368B-ms98-a-0134 599.101500 601.137375 so you know
