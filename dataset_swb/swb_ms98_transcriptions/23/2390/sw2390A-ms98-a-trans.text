sw2390A-ms98-a-0018 90.391375 103.717000 [silence]
sw2390A-ms98-a-0019 103.717000 110.829625 i know it's easy to do especially if you if you have a job where you have to buy nice clothes and things
sw2390A-ms98-a-0020 110.829625 115.792875 it it i think that is the biggest problem when you really not you don't
sw2390A-ms98-a-0021 115.792875 123.351250 don't really need the stuff but the nicer looking clothes are the more expensive nicely tailored clothes
sw2390A-ms98-a-0022 123.351250 129.084500 even though you could probably get away with a cotton dress you got to go out and buy the rayon dress or something you know

sw2390A-ms98-a-0029 157.872000 159.377750 [silence]
sw2390A-ms98-a-0030 159.377750 164.468500 yeah my oh my husband won't even put his name on it i don't believe in those
sw2390A-ms98-a-0031 164.468500 170.238000 it's like but but the time we went to Florida and needed to rent a car you know he believed in it 
sw2390A-ms98-a-0032 170.238000 173.001375 because you've got to have a credit card to rent a car
sw2390A-ms98-a-0033 173.001375 184.893250 [silence]
sw2390A-ms98-a-0034 184.893250 192.843000 yep that's ri[ght]- up here at some sto[res]- if it's if you're not in your home town you have to show them a credit card
sw2390A-ms98-a-0035 192.843000 197.148750 [silence]
sw2390A-ms98-a-0036 197.148750 207.501000 well actually if your check bounces i guess they could legally take it off your credit card if that's why they're taking it i mean i don't know how fair that is
sw2390A-ms98-a-0037 207.501000 210.101750 but i don't know um
sw2390A-ms98-a-0038 210.101750 214.338375 yeah i guess that percentage rates are like eighteen percent
sw2390A-ms98-a-0039 214.338375 218.147875 [silence]
sw2390A-ms98-a-0040 218.147875 220.967875 yeah thirteen that's not bad

sw2390A-ms98-a-0042 222.459500 229.383375 [silence]
sw2390A-ms98-a-0043 229.383375 241.227000 and yeah then you have to pay your fee and American Express you're really it's not a credit card because you have to pay it off at the end of the month but the fee for that it's really expensive isn't it
sw2390A-ms98-a-0044 241.227000 242.543125 [silence]
sw2390A-ms98-a-0045 242.543125 244.226375 i've never had one
sw2390A-ms98-a-0046 244.226375 251.623125 [silence]
sw2390A-ms98-a-0047 251.623125 252.564125 oh
sw2390A-ms98-a-0048 252.564125 253.806125 [laughter]
sw2390A-ms98-a-0049 253.806125 255.634375 that's good [laughter]
sw2390A-ms98-a-0050 255.634375 266.549250 [silence]
sw2390A-ms98-a-0051 266.549250 270.524750 yeah if he they they they have you pay it right out every month
sw2390A-ms98-a-0052 270.524750 272.159500 [silence]
sw2390A-ms98-a-0053 272.159500 273.940250 yeah because it's uh
sw2390A-ms98-a-0054 273.940250 274.996125 [silence]
sw2390A-ms98-a-0055 274.996125 276.807875 i know especially if your uh
sw2390A-ms98-a-0056 276.807875 279.937125 your reimbursement didn't come through [laughter]
sw2390A-ms98-a-0057 279.937125 287.891125 from your company because i know they i don't know why but you can use American Express and they give you an itemized bill and
sw2390A-ms98-a-0058 287.891125 292.953875 you can use that i don't know why you can't use other credit cards for business that way
sw2390A-ms98-a-0059 292.953875 296.651875 [silence]
sw2390A-ms98-a-0060 296.651875 298.576375 American Express
sw2390A-ms98-a-0061 298.576375 308.075375 [silence]
sw2390A-ms98-a-0062 308.075375 314.481000 yep this is this is it actually kind a boring subject in credit cards
sw2390A-ms98-a-0063 314.481000 322.484750 [vocalized-noise] you really you just know some people abuse them but not a joke about the person who pays their Master Card off with their Visa 
sw2390A-ms98-a-0064 322.484750 325.549500 i bet you th[ere]- i bet you there are people that do that
sw2390A-ms98-a-0065 325.549500 327.795750 [silence]
sw2390A-ms98-a-0066 327.795750 333.125875 [laughter] you go get a cash advance on one credit card to pay the other
sw2390A-ms98-a-0067 333.125875 336.942250 th[ey]- i think they charge more for cash advances so
sw2390A-ms98-a-0068 336.942250 347.014375 [silence]
sw2390A-ms98-a-0069 347.014375 350.429875 well it yeah you can't get cash advances
sw2390A-ms98-a-0070 350.429875 353.045125 [silence]
sw2390A-ms98-a-0071 353.045125 354.280125 oh
sw2390A-ms98-a-0072 354.280125 362.633000 [silence]
sw2390A-ms98-a-0073 362.633000 374.901500 oh well no uh it [laughter] i think that's a really bad plan in your budgeting if you have to pay one card off with another oh even[tually]- eventually
sw2390A-ms98-a-0074 374.901500 376.668000 no it doesn't
sw2390A-ms98-a-0075 376.668000 377.669250 [silence]
sw2390A-ms98-a-0076 377.669250 381.966125 [laughter] be solid for a couple of weeks then you get both bills back
sw2390A-ms98-a-0077 381.966125 388.158750 [silence]
sw2390A-ms98-a-0078 388.158750 389.814625 i know i don't
sw2390A-ms98-a-0079 389.814625 396.881625 credit cards almost seem unfair to a person who's who's got a victim of impulse buying
sw2390A-ms98-a-0080 396.881625 400.365000 like unfair advertising or something
sw2390A-ms98-a-0081 400.365000 409.945750 [silence]
sw2390A-ms98-a-0082 409.945750 411.479875 [laughter]
sw2390A-ms98-a-0083 411.479875 416.504000 [silence]
sw2390A-ms98-a-0084 416.504000 418.456625 oh wow
sw2390A-ms98-a-0085 418.456625 420.511750 [silence]
sw2390A-ms98-a-0086 420.511750 426.578750 so also when you give give someone a credit card like a normal credit card like a Visa or something
sw2390A-ms98-a-0087 426.578750 437.455875 that that um business person loses four percent because i used to work in a business and we al[ways]- and we used to lose four percent on the credit card orders
sw2390A-ms98-a-0088 437.455875 448.698125 yeah it's it's the thing if if a business is taking a credit card they're really they sacrificing something too it seems the credit card company makes money all the way around
sw2390A-ms98-a-0089 448.698125 450.292250 [silence]
sw2390A-ms98-a-0090 450.292250 453.444875 because it is a four percent that they take
sw2390A-ms98-a-0091 453.444875 455.812375 three or four percent
sw2390A-ms98-a-0092 455.812375 461.723125 i don't know which put you in better rating yep because when i used to go to the bank
sw2390A-ms98-a-0093 461.723125 464.229500 i used to take it off the deposit
sw2390A-ms98-a-0094 464.229500 467.357875 [vocalized-noise] you do have to take it off your deposit 
sw2390A-ms98-a-0095 467.357875 470.999125 yeah so it is a a service that they're offering
sw2390A-ms98-a-0096 470.999125 474.663625 [silence]
sw2390A-ms98-a-0097 474.663625 478.389375 i i know should own stock
sw2390A-ms98-a-0098 478.389375 479.458125 [silence]
sw2390A-ms98-a-0099 479.458125 481.834125 there instead of these uh

sw2390A-ms98-a-0101 485.538250 493.449500 [silence]
sw2390A-ms98-a-0102 493.449500 499.802000 i wonder how much is numbers how many billions of dollars it's got to be billions of dollars
sw2390A-ms98-a-0103 499.802000 509.474875 [silence]
sw2390A-ms98-a-0104 509.474875 510.865750 yeah
sw2390A-ms98-a-0105 510.865750 512.955000 that's uh probably true
sw2390A-ms98-a-0106 512.955000 517.790750 i mean you have the principal debt the car loan and your house loan
sw2390A-ms98-a-0107 517.790750 520.899000 and then there's all the merchandise you buy on your credit cards
sw2390A-ms98-a-0108 520.899000 522.851125 [laughter]
sw2390A-ms98-a-0109 522.851125 525.629875 [silence]
sw2390A-ms98-a-0110 525.629875 527.680375 that's personal [vocalized-noise]
sw2390A-ms98-a-0111 527.680375 529.332250 maybe they don't
sw2390A-ms98-a-0112 529.332250 539.487500 [silence]
sw2390A-ms98-a-0113 539.487500 540.823500 yeah
sw2390A-ms98-a-0114 540.823500 558.469625 [silence]

sw2390A-ms98-a-0116 566.143000 572.050125 i mean i don't know it's probably they're always saying the women are doing [vocalized-noise] are the spending ones 
sw2390A-ms98-a-0117 572.050125 578.038750 but i haven't heard o[ne]- uh a single woman taking their credit card away from the man [laughter]
