sw2345B-ms98-a-0041 229.778625 238.003375 well i- i wonder you know you know it i don't know this is tough but i guess the issue is is if it's drug people what's the solution
sw2345B-ms98-a-0042 238.003375 256.788500 [silence]
sw2345B-ms98-a-0043 256.788500 257.907500 well that

sw2345B-ms98-a-0055 284.686500 287.625375 well that that's real scary
sw2345B-ms98-a-0056 287.625375 291.636750 but is the is the solution uh cutting off drug supply
sw2345B-ms98-a-0057 291.636750 293.798625 [silence]
sw2345B-ms98-a-0058 293.798625 294.372000 o[r]-

sw2345B-ms98-a-0060 295.631000 296.682125 or is it
sw2345B-ms98-a-0061 296.682125 298.891625 [silence]
sw2345B-ms98-a-0062 298.891625 306.070625 yeah or yeah uh do you see that these people you know are they going to if if you cut supply it's going to raise the price
sw2345B-ms98-a-0063 306.070625 308.857500 or if you uh
sw2345B-ms98-a-0064 308.857500 320.454375 [silence]
sw2345B-ms98-a-0065 320.454375 326.220750 well how how expensive is um how expensive is marijuana it's not very expensive is it
sw2345B-ms98-a-0066 326.220750 334.149625 but i mean the people that are i'd be curious to if the people that are wouldn't you think the people that are breaking in are probably
sw2345B-ms98-a-0067 334.149625 340.375625 are probably crack that have got a pretty high because_1 i would think a hundred dollars worth of marijuana i don't know what it costs but
sw2345B-ms98-a-0068 340.375625 352.792250 i should think that'd be more than [laughter] a lot more than just ordinary recreation it would be interesting to see if to the problem is is is what do you lock them_1 up for you know
sw2345B-ms98-a-0069 352.792250 355.362375 [silence]
sw2345B-ms98-a-0070 355.362375 356.194250 yeah

sw2345B-ms98-a-0072 359.054875 361.093875 but they don't have enough proof [vocalized-noise] them_1
sw2345B-ms98-a-0073 361.093875 362.504250 and then we got to rai[se]-
sw2345B-ms98-a-0074 362.504250 364.582875 [silence]
sw2345B-ms98-a-0075 364.582875 375.067375 well we had interesting enough we had a in in Garland before we moved we had some neighborhood kids came by and stole uh uh drill and our saw and and i had them_1 marked and uh
sw2345B-ms98-a-0076 375.067375 380.208750 we called the police about a week later the guy caught these kids riding a m[otor]- um
sw2345B-ms98-a-0077 380.208750 384.945125 a motor scooter or a a go it was a go-cart in the in the alley
sw2345B-ms98-a-0078 384.945125 396.042750 and he got to talking to the kids and and we recovered the drill and the saw it was but uh it it's one of those you know it was uh not a not a real expensive neighborhood
sw2345B-ms98-a-0079 396.042750 410.387250 uh but it's it's interesting that the the motivation and the question is what's the motivation not to steal and i i guess that's what bothers it's like the criminal you know if somebody says well let's lock him up for life well
sw2345B-ms98-a-0080 410.387250 418.117625 how should he you know what bothers me is the incentive that he's if you if you know you're going to be in there for life why should you just be good
sw2345B-ms98-a-0081 418.117625 428.977250 but if you if you say i'm not going to let you out till you have a skill and we think you're reformed well that's not how they do it they let them_1 out when they time is served i
sw2345B-ms98-a-0082 428.977250 441.768000 i i guess the problem is is is what it would take to do that would be more money than we it's like the school issue and which i guess [laughter-we're] [laughter-not] supposed to talk to but anyway the idea of how much money would it take to reform these criminals and lock them_1 all up
sw2345B-ms98-a-0083 441.768000 447.320875 [silence]

sw2345B-ms98-a-0117 590.956125 599.586500 that uh i've forgot what the per[centage]- forty or fifty percent it's surprisingly high that people that shoot each other know them_1 i mean it's not like you know a [vocalized-noise]
