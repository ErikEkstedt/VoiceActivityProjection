sw2353A-ms98-a-0012 45.456125 60.403125 you know i- i really agree with you um i uh though i've never done that myself i i'm was a basically an education major when i graduated from college and i accepted a job that at the time was just slightly above the poverty level to teach
sw2353A-ms98-a-0013 60.403125 73.265250 to um very rural children in a very low income district and i spent a year teaching there and i think it was probably one of my largest eye-opening experiences because i come from a nice 
sw2353A-ms98-a-0014 73.265250 77.837500 middle class white suburban home and i did it um
sw2353A-ms98-a-0015 77.837500 92.032875 for one reason i wanted i was working on a masters degree so i wanted to stay close to where i was working on a masters degree but also because i just thought that it would be interesting to live someplace else so totally different than my own upbringing and i it changed
sw2353A-ms98-a-0016 92.032875 97.653000 it probably changed my political views it changed my understanding of the world around me
sw2353A-ms98-a-0017 97.653000 111.048375 and i think um in fact if if i had to do it all again i you know i- i after that you know you never think of it because i guess because i paid for all of my college education myself i never thought about
sw2353A-ms98-a-0018 111.048375 115.292125 doing that because i had all these college loans i'd started paying back
sw2353A-ms98-a-0019 115.292125 123.028750 um be[cause]- so that was that was one reason why i never considered it but now that i'm further along and i'm still paying these college loans
sw2353A-ms98-a-0020 123.028750 131.209875 i- i think realistically you know you can have your college loans delayed now because_1 i had them delayed because i'm back in graduate school at thirty years old
sw2353A-ms98-a-0021 131.209875 138.616125 um i've had them delayed because i'm back in graduate school and on that form it says if your joining the Peace Corps you can have them delayed
sw2353A-ms98-a-0022 138.616125 147.457250 uh and i thought that was you know very interesting and i- i would have thought of that earlier i probably would have done you know just like is that is this is that the Mormon church
sw2353A-ms98-a-0023 147.457250 159.811750 that does that um-hum because_1 one of my neighbors uh did that in Pittsburgh from Pittsburgh and i thought you know that really now that i'm thirty years old i think that one or two years out of my life would've probably like you said
sw2353A-ms98-a-0024 159.811750 168.483250 to be able to travel someplace else whether it be the United States or outside the country i think would've been a very good um experience for me

sw2353A-ms98-a-0036 197.196000 202.393000 and i think you know we have such a need now you know i taught you know i- i think i was paid
sw2353A-ms98-a-0037 202.393000 214.732000 uh about nine thousand dollars to teach for the year and i worked in a very rural school district and i- i one of the things i taught was a computer class and these kids
sw2353A-ms98-a-0038 214.732000 225.507625 um you know every girl i taught except for one was pregnant many of the boys in the room had children and they were they were high school juniors
sw2353A-ms98-a-0039 225.507625 231.698500 and i and i just there you know they came from poverty they were going to continue in poverty
sw2353A-ms98-a-0040 231.698500 242.292125 and it was it was the school district couldn't hire many people it was very difficult for them to hire and i think you know in the sense that aspect of public service for education in some of the inner cities
sw2353A-ms98-a-0041 242.292125 250.770000 for um just social workers in some of the inner cities and some of the rural areas where they just need advice on medical um
sw2353A-ms98-a-0042 250.770000 260.894500 things i think it's a really good idea and even if it is overseas see i never i- i tell you sometimes i worry about things overseas because we have such problems right here in our own country

sw2353A-ms98-a-0058 295.391000 304.197125 uh probably too carefree at the beginning and then at the end i had to be too serious [vocalized-noise]

sw2353A-ms98-a-0066 321.018125 326.423750 uh because it's something that you know we don't talk about in this country probably enough

sw2353A-ms98-a-0075 349.941375 358.870125 i really think i think um people you should i you know the kids today i teach i spend a lot of my time teaching college students
sw2353A-ms98-a-0076 358.870125 366.361375 and um i find great disgust in them in their in their um [laughter] their self-centeredness
sw2353A-ms98-a-0077 366.361375 380.691875 and their inability to understand um multicultural or multiracial situations and i really you know they don't understand uh how other people live um they don't understand

sw2353A-ms98-a-0082 397.496750 405.262375 you know today's young people are short-term pleasure oriented and everything has to be an immediate reward and it has to be fun

sw2353A-ms98-a-0086 420.924625 424.798125 uh-huh because i guess because_1 of the changes in Eastern Europe
sw2353A-ms98-a-0087 424.798125 439.746000 uh they've increased funding for the Peace Corps some of the i guess it's some of the peace dividend in the sense you known when they're decreasing some of the military spending some of that money has gone into the Peace Corps and some of the other overseas programs uh
