sw2312B-ms98-a-0046 188.907125 194.614625 [vocalized-noise] there's just not as many really good shows on i think as there used to be
sw2312B-ms98-a-0047 194.614625 202.661750 i guess a lot of people think that the shows that i watch are kind of stupid and most of my friends and the people i know don't
sw2312B-ms98-a-0048 202.661750 204.812000 yeah i like that

sw2312B-ms98-a-0050 210.397625 220.663625 well yeah and what i like about that show is that the time the time period that that takes place in is exactly the age i was during that time period so
sw2312B-ms98-a-0051 220.663625 226.634625 yeah it's kind of funny to you know sit back and remember it brings back a lot of memories
