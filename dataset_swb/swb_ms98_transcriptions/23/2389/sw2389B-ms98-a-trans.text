sw2389B-ms98-a-0005 21.686125 23.523125 yes definitely
sw2389B-ms98-a-0006 23.523125 26.999500 [silence]
sw2389B-ms98-a-0007 26.999500 35.506500 well i feel that uh i we've missed as far as the top jobs go you know [vocalized-noise] the the higher echelon 
sw2389B-ms98-a-0008 35.506500 38.679375 because_1 if you look at most corporations there isn't a woman
sw2389B-ms98-a-0009 38.679375 51.520625 you know that's on the board of directors or that type of thing they're mostly all men there there may be a few but very incidental [laughter] and uh i i really think that it'll be a long time probably before we see that
sw2389B-ms98-a-0010 51.520625 62.607625 in one sense um i['m]- i'm an older person in my fifties so i feel that we've lost some things in the sense that women have to work today
sw2389B-ms98-a-0011 62.607625 66.835000 you know that that they're not in the home by choice anymore
sw2389B-ms98-a-0012 66.835000 70.700000 i[t's]- most of the ti[me]- you know e[ven]- even if you want to say home you c[an't]- you really can't
sw2389B-ms98-a-0013 70.700000 72.311750 i[t's]- i[t's]- i[t's]-
sw2389B-ms98-a-0014 72.311750 83.255375 y[ou]- you know it's it's gotten to be a two income family to just survive today between taxes and the cost of living and i don't think raises have kept up with you know a lot of the stuff
sw2389B-ms98-a-0015 83.255375 90.663750 uh you know as far as your medical insurance and uh just groceries and gasoline and all this you know
sw2389B-ms98-a-0016 90.663750 103.388750 so i think that we we did come a long way in the sense that we ha[ve]- we're allowed to vote in you know like you say we're out in the labor force but i think we've lost something too
sw2389B-ms98-a-0017 103.388750 108.823125 [silence]
sw2389B-ms98-a-0018 108.823125 110.369875 oh God love her
sw2389B-ms98-a-0019 110.369875 116.169125 [silence]
sw2389B-ms98-a-0020 116.169125 117.473125 yeah
sw2389B-ms98-a-0021 117.473125 129.011250 [silence]
sw2389B-ms98-a-0022 129.011250 139.619000 that's what i mean and and you know there's a lot of truth to that if you're not going to have a family then that's fine then y[ou]- you know a career is is a smart choice and i think it's great
sw2389B-ms98-a-0023 139.619000 144.860000 but if you you have a family i think you owe the family a responsibility
sw2389B-ms98-a-0024 144.860000 156.539250 and to have children and just get a day care or someone to take care of it and not really have the bonding process that takes place with babies and stuff you know
sw2389B-ms98-a-0025 156.539250 166.542000 uh i think that both the mother and the child lose and i think that's why there's so many problems you know with kids today because_1 they don't have the family roots anymore
sw2389B-ms98-a-0026 166.542000 171.825750 you know i'm not saying that that it's totally gone but it's nothing like what it used to be
sw2389B-ms98-a-0027 171.825750 173.602250 you know in that sense
sw2389B-ms98-a-0028 173.602250 190.441375 [silence]
sw2389B-ms98-a-0029 190.441375 191.803500 oh definitely
sw2389B-ms98-a-0030 191.803500 198.229125 [silence]
sw2389B-ms98-a-0031 198.229125 199.768125 that's right
sw2389B-ms98-a-0032 199.768125 207.166500 they don't want to take care of the kids and the house and that kind of thing that's very true but then they shouldn't have a family
sw2389B-ms98-a-0033 207.166500 211.200375 that's what i'm saying you know i i think it's great that women have a choice today
sw2389B-ms98-a-0034 211.200375 222.348750 that there are ways to prevent families you know like those basically there's contraceptives and all kinds of ways to prevent pregnancies there's no need to have children if you don't want them
sw2389B-ms98-a-0035 222.348750 232.702750 [silence]
sw2389B-ms98-a-0036 232.702750 242.167125 that's fine that that's the freedom of choice and i i agree with that because anyone who has children that doesn't really want them isn't going to be a good parent
sw2389B-ms98-a-0037 242.167125 249.753250 uh well i shouldn't say they're not going to be a good parent they won't be a caring parent like they won't have that uh
sw2389B-ms98-a-0038 249.753250 253.940625 right tha[t's]- that's what i mean it they'll feel like it's uh a job
sw2389B-ms98-a-0039 253.940625 256.870375 i[t's]- it's not like something that they really wanted
sw2389B-ms98-a-0040 256.870375 261.200000 like i had three children and i mean i i i wanted every one of them
sw2389B-ms98-a-0041 261.200000 267.518750 i'm not sorry i had any of them_1 and i worked third shift for a good part of my life just so i would be home with them
sw2389B-ms98-a-0042 267.518750 272.330375 you know i had to work but i tried to make it as painless as possible
sw2389B-ms98-a-0043 272.330375 284.848625 in fact at one time i worked as a second shift and uh uh one Saturday morning we were all sitting at the breakfast table and the kids were talking daddy this daddy that daddy this daddy that and i was sitting there it was like i didn't belong anymore
sw2389B-ms98-a-0044 284.848625 288.081375 and it was because i had worked for about nine months
sw2389B-ms98-a-0045 288.081375 291.314000 and when they were coming home i was going to work
sw2389B-ms98-a-0046 291.314000 298.499000 and i wasn't there at supper time or bed time or they couldn't tell me what went on at school because they'd be coming in the door i'd be going out
sw2389B-ms98-a-0047 298.499000 302.429125 so we were i i felt i was losing my family
sw2389B-ms98-a-0048 302.429125 308.719500 and that's why i said that's it i either have to quit or you know try something else so i went on third shift
sw2389B-ms98-a-0049 308.719500 311.034250 and i worked that shift for eleven years
sw2389B-ms98-a-0050 311.034250 312.547250 yeah
sw2389B-ms98-a-0051 312.547250 317.169000 yeah just so that my kids would would have me at home
sw2389B-ms98-a-0052 317.169000 330.965875 you know and i feel that's very important it really is and it's too bad be[cause]- because mothers miss out on so much too so i mean in the sense that uh we've come a long way yes but we've sacrificed a lot to get there 
sw2389B-ms98-a-0053 330.965875 341.141625 and uh i really think that if uh like after second World War when women went to work in factories and all that that was like out of necessity because_1 the men weren't here anymore
sw2389B-ms98-a-0054 341.141625 345.289875 but then it got to be a point where they got some independence
sw2389B-ms98-a-0055 345.289875 347.192000 [silence]
sw2389B-ms98-a-0056 347.192000 351.984375 exactly a man can afford the necessities a woman affords the luxuries
sw2389B-ms98-a-0057 351.984375 358.493000 and i notice today's uh kids you know like we had apartments before we had homes
sw2389B-ms98-a-0058 358.493000 361.739625 and we had to walk before we had a car
sw2389B-ms98-a-0059 361.739625 366.880125 and now kids at sixteen years old they have their birthday what what do they get they get a car
sw2389B-ms98-a-0060 366.880125 371.692125 and uh it to me it's like we've lost our values in this country
sw2389B-ms98-a-0061 371.692125 378.000625 we really have and i i'm not trying to be uh you know a prude or old fashioned or anything but
sw2389B-ms98-a-0062 378.000625 389.066000 i i don't think if you unless you earn something and you've worked for it and you have a sense of pride about it because while i did this in uh you know no one gave it to me
sw2389B-ms98-a-0063 389.066000 396.901125 you'll take better care of that and you'll prize that possession more than someone handing something to you
sw2389B-ms98-a-0064 396.901125 404.930250 and it's just like college too i think that if a kid goes to college and you can help them fine but i don't think you should pay the whole way
sw2389B-ms98-a-0065 404.930250 409.034000 [silence]
sw2389B-ms98-a-0066 409.034000 410.615750 of course
sw2389B-ms98-a-0067 410.615750 419.324125 [silence]
sw2389B-ms98-a-0068 419.324125 420.440375 yeah
sw2389B-ms98-a-0069 420.440375 427.385750 [silence]
sw2389B-ms98-a-0070 427.385750 428.421500 sure
sw2389B-ms98-a-0071 428.421500 435.027750 [silence]
sw2389B-ms98-a-0072 435.027750 438.724125 but i'll bet your values are a lot higher
sw2389B-ms98-a-0073 438.724125 446.812500 you know y[our]- y[our]- and your self esteem and the w[ay]- the way you uh you know think about things is probably a lot more common sense
sw2389B-ms98-a-0074 446.812500 450.524250 than these kids that don't have that responsibility
sw2389B-ms98-a-0075 450.524250 458.602375 [silence]
sw2389B-ms98-a-0076 458.602375 460.982500 you that that [vocalized-noise]
sw2389B-ms98-a-0077 460.982500 462.428750 [silence]
sw2389B-ms98-a-0078 462.428750 464.636250 sure yeah
sw2389B-ms98-a-0079 464.636250 475.430625 [silence]
sw2389B-ms98-a-0080 475.430625 477.814500 sure they probably don't even have any
sw2389B-ms98-a-0081 477.814500 480.765500 or yeah exactly
sw2389B-ms98-a-0082 480.765500 492.663750 and that's what i say y[ou'll]- you'll b[e]- you'll be so much better off for it as you get older because you know a lot of kids resent things that parents tell them and and stuff but it's because you've been there
sw2389B-ms98-a-0083 492.663750 502.528375 and no one can tell anyone anything any[thing]- you know you're going to find out for yourself but i mean i don't think you should just not listen to advice even if you don't take it just listen
sw2389B-ms98-a-0084 502.528375 507.752500 you know there's there's no harm in that whereas sometimes you can't even get that from a kid you know
sw2389B-ms98-a-0085 507.752500 510.477125 [laughter] just attention you know
sw2389B-ms98-a-0086 510.477125 518.084375 but really uh wh[at]- what do you feel the changes in the future like with the abortions and that type of thing
sw2389B-ms98-a-0087 518.084375 520.155375 women in politics and
sw2389B-ms98-a-0088 520.155375 523.856750 president someday maybe [laughter]

sw2389B-ms98-a-0094 552.615000 554.652750 yeah yeah
sw2389B-ms98-a-0095 554.652750 562.018750 well i i still think people have a choice i you know if you can live with it and it's not you know your conscience is clear
sw2389B-ms98-a-0096 562.018750 570.756625 then i mean a[ll]- all of us are going to answer to it one day maybe or maybe not i don't know i mean no one's said for sure you know
sw2389B-ms98-a-0097 570.756625 572.136250 but uh
sw2389B-ms98-a-0098 572.136250 577.904125 [silence]
sw2389B-ms98-a-0099 577.904125 579.540000 yes yes
sw2389B-ms98-a-0100 579.540000 581.937625 which i mean i think it should be anyway
sw2389B-ms98-a-0101 581.937625 585.067250 [silence]
sw2389B-ms98-a-0102 585.067250 586.254625 no

sw2389B-ms98-a-0104 588.852625 594.042750 yeah because_1 i mean you as an individual what you would do that that to me is your business
sw2389B-ms98-a-0105 594.042750 595.677250 and uh
