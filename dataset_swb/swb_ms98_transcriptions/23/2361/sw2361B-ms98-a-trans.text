sw2361B-ms98-a-0002 35.739625 37.147375 that's true
sw2361B-ms98-a-0003 37.147375 40.088625 and you get sequestered or something then you're there for months
sw2361B-ms98-a-0004 40.088625 41.741750 [laughter]
sw2361B-ms98-a-0005 41.741750 44.828500 w[hen]- when you get sequestered and you're there for months
sw2361B-ms98-a-0006 44.828500 46.344750 true 
sw2361B-ms98-a-0007 46.344750 87.654875 [silence]
sw2361B-ms98-a-0008 87.654875 88.901000 yeah
sw2361B-ms98-a-0009 88.901000 112.788875 [silence]
sw2361B-ms98-a-0010 112.788875 114.335250 [laughter]
sw2361B-ms98-a-0011 114.335250 115.394750 [silence]
sw2361B-ms98-a-0012 115.394750 117.124875 yeah right
sw2361B-ms98-a-0013 117.124875 134.362875 [silence]
sw2361B-ms98-a-0014 134.362875 137.403375 well as as you say the the um
sw2361B-ms98-a-0015 137.403375 146.405625 benefits are the biggest part of it i think that today with costs uh for medical insurance and eyeglasses and dental and all that
sw2361B-ms98-a-0016 146.405625 153.237375 it is a boo[m]- a a a plus to have that ev[en]- as far as your uh salary goes you know along with it
sw2361B-ms98-a-0017 153.237375 166.002875 because_1 it's not out of pocket money and it they also have good in[surance]- uh life insurance policies good retirement Dakota the um jet funds all that stuff i think you know the IRA's
sw2361B-ms98-a-0018 166.002875 169.344250 uh the profit sharing the stock options
sw2361B-ms98-a-0019 169.344250 180.742875 there are a they offer a lot of ways for you to save money too if you have any extra you know that like the uh code over the two for one type of thing or they match half i guess it is
sw2361B-ms98-a-0020 180.742875 182.510500 and um
sw2361B-ms98-a-0021 182.510500 189.118750 i think that uh a a lot of it's the personal recognition that the company gives people if they do a good job
sw2361B-ms98-a-0022 189.118750 192.245250 uh the incentive you know to want to do a good job
sw2361B-ms98-a-0023 192.245250 194.139250 and the um
sw2361B-ms98-a-0024 194.139250 200.133875 MIR awards banquets and things i think they do a lot as far as trying to motivate people
sw2361B-ms98-a-0025 200.133875 203.387500 and they're uh meetings
sw2361B-ms98-a-0026 203.387500 205.654000 to keep you full informed
sw2361B-ms98-a-0027 205.654000 217.764750 you don't find that much in small companies because_1 you can kind of interface but when you get a big company like ours i think it's great that they take the time to you know give us a monthly meeting to tell us what's going on
sw2361B-ms98-a-0028 217.764750 219.953125 that type of thing um
sw2361B-ms98-a-0029 219.953125 220.956875 [silence]
sw2361B-ms98-a-0030 220.956875 222.151250 uh
sw2361B-ms98-a-0031 222.151250 227.377750 we interface kind of like uh on the tip teams and things i think that's a good deal
sw2361B-ms98-a-0032 227.377750 233.552250 it gives you a chance to feel like you're a part of a group or the organization and that you're heard
sw2361B-ms98-a-0033 233.552250 237.182125 and know and if you have ideas that type of thing 
sw2361B-ms98-a-0034 237.182125 242.775000 [silence]
sw2361B-ms98-a-0035 242.775000 246.928750 oh i use it up [laughter]
sw2361B-ms98-a-0036 246.928750 269.568750 [silence]
sw2361B-ms98-a-0037 269.568750 271.791375 do you have a mandatory
sw2361B-ms98-a-0038 271.791375 274.528500 uh do you have a mandatory shut down
sw2361B-ms98-a-0039 274.528500 278.401125 [silence]
sw2361B-ms98-a-0040 278.401125 283.656750 oh that's why see see you can you're able to do that but we haven't got much choice
sw2361B-ms98-a-0041 283.656750 292.784750 that's the if i had to say one thing negative that would be it because i feel like you know you earn your vacation time and you should be able to take it when you want to
sw2361B-ms98-a-0042 292.784750 298.052375 but we're not allowed to we have to take two weeks when the company shuts down you know
sw2361B-ms98-a-0043 298.052375 305.207625 and i can understand it from there point of view in on the one hand because they have to you know consider the customers that they're supplying
sw2361B-ms98-a-0044 305.207625 310.069250 but it makes it very hard especially if a husband and wife work at Texas Instruments
sw2361B-ms98-a-0045 310.069250 315.925000 and one has vacation one time and one has vacation another time you know you're not in the same area
sw2361B-ms98-a-0046 315.925000 320.046000 so you have to take a two week shut down and it's not at the same time
sw2361B-ms98-a-0047 320.046000 321.931625 so that isn't too nice
sw2361B-ms98-a-0048 321.931625 328.840125 uh this year they were going to try to do something different about that too they were going to try to schedule the whole site to go down at the same time
sw2361B-ms98-a-0049 328.840125 332.810250 to eliminate that and that you're talking about five thousand people
sw2361B-ms98-a-0050 332.810250 335.503875 so that's quite a feat in itself
sw2361B-ms98-a-0051 335.503875 356.096375 [silence]
sw2361B-ms98-a-0052 356.096375 357.490250 uh-huh
sw2361B-ms98-a-0053 357.490250 373.118500 [silence]
sw2361B-ms98-a-0054 373.118500 374.498500 uh-huh
sw2361B-ms98-a-0055 374.498500 387.631750 [silence]
sw2361B-ms98-a-0056 387.631750 389.507250 oh that's great
sw2361B-ms98-a-0057 389.507250 395.908500 [silence]
sw2361B-ms98-a-0058 395.908500 398.328000 yeah really that's excellent
sw2361B-ms98-a-0059 398.328000 424.237375 [silence]
sw2361B-ms98-a-0060 424.237375 426.244625 yeah yeah
sw2361B-ms98-a-0061 426.244625 437.444125 [silence]
sw2361B-ms98-a-0062 437.444125 438.804750 yeah
sw2361B-ms98-a-0063 438.804750 445.716875 [silence]
sw2361B-ms98-a-0064 445.716875 446.984375 yeah
sw2361B-ms98-a-0065 446.984375 451.861875 well they're doing a lot with um automation specialist also that's what i do
sw2361B-ms98-a-0066 451.861875 461.107500 uh where you have to go to school to or run the new au[tomated]- automated equipment it's all computerized and and stuff
sw2361B-ms98-a-0067 461.107500 473.116875 and uh there's a lot of job security in that because it takes so long to uh come up to an experience level where you're able to you know you have to be able to maintain them do the maintenance uh
sw2361B-ms98-a-0068 473.116875 478.474875 diagnose what's wrong with the machine and you know do whatever it takes to get it started again and things
sw2361B-ms98-a-0069 478.474875 481.575000 and interface with the technicians in the toolroom
sw2361B-ms98-a-0070 481.575000 485.193625 so you're kind of like your own boss as far as the machinery goes
sw2361B-ms98-a-0071 485.193625 493.985375 and um it's about a two year to three year experience before you're able to really um i would say payback
sw2361B-ms98-a-0072 493.985375 496.584500 you know and and do the job well
sw2361B-ms98-a-0073 496.584500 502.130375 and you're still learning even after all that time because_1 they're very complex machines
sw2361B-ms98-a-0074 502.130375 505.110125 [silence]
sw2361B-ms98-a-0075 505.110125 508.280125 exactly that's right
sw2361B-ms98-a-0076 508.280125 509.816625 yeah
sw2361B-ms98-a-0077 509.816625 514.374500 and they offer uh a lot of uh opportunity to go to school
sw2361B-ms98-a-0078 514.374500 521.882875 that's another good uh benefit that TI has and they'll pay for ninety percent of your schooling with no commitment to them
sw2361B-ms98-a-0079 521.882875 527.512250 you know like a lot of companies will send you to school but you have to sign a paper that you'll work for them for five years
sw2361B-ms98-a-0080 527.512250 530.188250 or uh you know to that affect
sw2361B-ms98-a-0081 530.188250 538.786375 and you're kind of locked in so that if a career move comes up where you could take advantage of it you can't if you're you know signed in a contract
sw2361B-ms98-a-0082 538.786375 541.244500 whereas at TI they don't do that
sw2361B-ms98-a-0083 541.244500 561.617750 [silence]
sw2361B-ms98-a-0084 561.617750 563.478875 oh
sw2361B-ms98-a-0085 563.478875 565.424875 oh
sw2361B-ms98-a-0086 565.424875 566.885125 oh
sw2361B-ms98-a-0087 566.885125 573.397500 [silence]
sw2361B-ms98-a-0088 573.397500 574.591625 yeah
sw2361B-ms98-a-0089 574.591625 575.597875 [silence]
sw2361B-ms98-a-0090 575.597875 579.928625 well this part of the country there's no sh[ortage]- shortage of uh good schools
sw2361B-ms98-a-0091 579.928625 585.845625 you know like MIT and and uh Boston's only uh an hours drive from here
sw2361B-ms98-a-0092 585.845625 590.573375 so a lot of the the people can go you know to uh a good school
sw2361B-ms98-a-0093 590.573375 596.224750 and right in Rhode Island there are some nice colleges too Rhode Island college and
sw2361B-ms98-a-0094 596.224750 601.022250 [silence]
