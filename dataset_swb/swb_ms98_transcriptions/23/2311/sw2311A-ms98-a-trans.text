sw2311A-ms98-a-0017 122.590500 126.355875 so she went out and she changed her whole her whole wardrobe
sw2311A-ms98-a-0018 126.355875 131.905125 [silence]

sw2311A-ms98-a-0022 146.138875 153.149375 [silence]
sw2311A-ms98-a-0023 153.149375 165.403375 i know because you know even like i ironed a shirt to come to work tonight you know just a nice blouse and if i was going to wear it with a suit or something i would have had done a a ten times better job
sw2311A-ms98-a-0024 165.403375 167.177000 [silence]
sw2311A-ms98-a-0025 167.177000 170.661875 yeah and i[t's]- it's got to be more expensive [laughter]
sw2311A-ms98-a-0026 170.661875 180.347250 [laughter] yep but that's what's you have when when you have to deal with the public or deal with the customers they like that that business su[it]- suit
sw2311A-ms98-a-0027 180.347250 183.509625 [silence]

sw2311A-ms98-a-0032 201.579625 203.085375 [silence]
sw2311A-ms98-a-0033 203.085375 205.442375 boots
sw2311A-ms98-a-0034 205.442375 219.655875 do you have to do you find that you you can [vocalized-noise] a[re]- are you happy with wearing dress slacks instead of dresses because_1 i know a lot of people who dress it's usually dresses dresses they har[dly]- hardly don't wear dress pants or anything
sw2311A-ms98-a-0035 219.655875 221.528375 [silence]
sw2311A-ms98-a-0036 221.528375 223.266750 yeah
sw2311A-ms98-a-0037 223.266750 236.004875 see all the girls that i know i know a couple girls that work in insurance offices and that's all they they wear are dresses they hardly ever wear pants then on the weekends you know they wear their jeans and their sweats
sw2311A-ms98-a-0038 236.004875 244.906250 but the[y]- they uh the pants just aren't dressy enough but in the wintertime i think i would be [laughter-wearing] [laughter] [vocalized-noise] pants
sw2311A-ms98-a-0039 244.906250 253.073000 [silence]
sw2311A-ms98-a-0040 253.073000 254.810625 ye[ah]- yeah
sw2311A-ms98-a-0041 254.810625 267.576875 [silence]
sw2311A-ms98-a-0042 267.576875 269.085375 yeah
sw2311A-ms98-a-0043 269.085375 278.892875 yeah even even here the secretaries they usually dress nice but it's not strange to seem them in jeans and a sweater
sw2311A-ms98-a-0044 278.892875 293.573750 so and you know sometimes it is on Fridays but in the summertime if they're going to like i know a couple of the girls and this one lady goes camping a lot and like every Friday she's sh[e's]- you know she still does her same function and everything
sw2311A-ms98-a-0045 293.573750 299.836125 but uh normally she's dressed to the T she's just perfect
sw2311A-ms98-a-0046 299.836125 306.691250 yeah well we're fortunate here because_1 the building's um very um climate controlled
sw2311A-ms98-a-0047 306.691250 321.377125 but we work in an electronics field and we have to wear polyester smocks so it's usually um a tank top in the Summer and then silk and polyester are the only things that are close enough to being dressy
sw2311A-ms98-a-0048 321.377125 334.976250 and they and [vocalized-noise] polyester's terrible on me and i wear my silk under this polyester uh smock and you just get so hot even though it's a nice temperature in here so you really in the summertime have to
sw2311A-ms98-a-0049 334.976250 341.544750 we have to dress extra light because we have to wear these smocks [laughter]
sw2311A-ms98-a-0050 341.544750 356.534875 yeah and in the wintertime pretty much just uh um even a turtleneck's all right because you have to wear these smocks a turtleneck and a sweater and the smock would be too much it it gets really hot
sw2311A-ms98-a-0051 356.534875 365.278000 so it's kind of weird when it's really cold w[e]- we come in pretty much we ha[ve]- take our coat off and then we take our outside sweater off
sw2311A-ms98-a-0052 365.278000 369.445750 trucking through the parking lot [laughter]
sw2311A-ms98-a-0053 369.445750 374.962000 [silence]
sw2311A-ms98-a-0054 374.962000 376.443250 yeah
sw2311A-ms98-a-0055 376.443250 380.709625 but they still they have to keep the pants really just
sw2311A-ms98-a-0056 380.709625 382.366000 but
sw2311A-ms98-a-0057 382.366000 391.952250 yeah and their shirts have to be pressed so they still have the same thing where if they could dress casually it would take them less time too
sw2311A-ms98-a-0058 391.952250 398.899000 but i know what it's like i mean just putting on a pair of panty hose can take you an extra five [laughter-minutes]
sw2311A-ms98-a-0059 398.899000 400.707875 yeah
sw2311A-ms98-a-0060 400.707875 424.560500 [silence]
sw2311A-ms98-a-0061 424.560500 431.702250 oh i know um even my dress shoes i don't wear them_1 a lot i notice the wear on the bottom of them
sw2311A-ms98-a-0062 431.702250 439.241000 and there's no way i could wear them all day i would be the one of the women in flats [laughter]
sw2311A-ms98-a-0063 439.241000 444.313750 well i'm pretty short but i have a very bad knee i couldn't
sw2311A-ms98-a-0064 444.313750 459.291000 couldn't walk in heels all day when i go dancing i i- i going out i'm like [vocalized-noise] i- i stand the ball on my foot hoping i don't slip on my heel because if my if i s[tand]- if i jam down on my heel too much my knee doesn't catch and
sw2311A-ms98-a-0065 459.291000 463.685875 it's bad well it's
sw2311A-ms98-a-0066 463.685875 475.974000 no we don't at all um we used to be a lot busier so um we it used to be important what you wore if you're comfortable because_1 you knew you were going to spend a lot of time working
sw2311A-ms98-a-0067 475.974000 485.743250 and now it's very slow and i pretty much i've taken a couple courses and no[w]- now i sit at my desk and i and i read read my courses
