sw2335B-ms98-a-0002 1.004000 2.610500 so what do you think
sw2335B-ms98-a-0003 2.610500 19.318125 [silence]
sw2335B-ms98-a-0004 19.318125 20.503750 yep
sw2335B-ms98-a-0005 20.503750 26.284750 [silence]
sw2335B-ms98-a-0006 26.284750 27.976125 what about
sw2335B-ms98-a-0007 27.976125 31.448000 i agree with the upper and lower level you know
sw2335B-ms98-a-0008 31.448000 36.367625 because that's the lowest thing for themselves plus there's nobody for them to look up to
sw2335B-ms98-a-0009 36.367625 38.881125 but i also blame some of it on parents
sw2335B-ms98-a-0010 38.881125 39.971375 [silence]
sw2335B-ms98-a-0011 39.971375 42.588000 because parents aren't parents
sw2335B-ms98-a-0012 42.588000 46.328750 because_1 i remember even when i was growing up
sw2335B-ms98-a-0013 46.328750 51.965875 [noise] i'm thirty five [laughter] i remember when i was growing up and i had friends
sw2335B-ms98-a-0014 51.965875 59.358250 that used to do stuff like you know go to the store and steal stuff my mother warned us it's like i don't care what your friends do
sw2335B-ms98-a-0015 59.358250 66.687875 if you do it then that was it i mean i knew that i would get mea[n]- more trouble from my mother than from
sw2335B-ms98-a-0016 66.687875 72.438125 from anybody else and i think that's the basic is they have no morals anymore so they don't care
sw2335B-ms98-a-0017 72.438125 75.097625 so [vocalized-noise]
sw2335B-ms98-a-0018 75.097625 79.458250 but now as far as what they can do about it i don't know
sw2335B-ms98-a-0019 79.458250 82.246875 you can't make parents be parents [laughter]
sw2335B-ms98-a-0020 82.246875 86.300125 [silence]
sw2335B-ms98-a-0021 86.300125 87.727000 you know
sw2335B-ms98-a-0022 87.727000 88.801500 [silence]
sw2335B-ms98-a-0023 88.801500 95.329000 i guess if you gave the gave them_1 jobs th[at]- that's another problem with the United States there's no jobs anymore
sw2335B-ms98-a-0024 95.329000 96.347125 [silence]
sw2335B-ms98-a-0025 96.347125 97.705125 but
sw2335B-ms98-a-0026 97.705125 107.110375 [silence]
sw2335B-ms98-a-0027 107.110375 109.463000 that'll work to a point
sw2335B-ms98-a-0028 109.463000 114.389250 well that'd work to a point because some kids are just bad anyway i don't care what you do to them_1
sw2335B-ms98-a-0029 114.389250 119.396625 you know so i think it depends on how much trouble that kids has been in
sw2335B-ms98-a-0030 119.396625 120.874500 you know
sw2335B-ms98-a-0031 120.874500 126.146625 because uh a child can get into anything regar[dless]- i don't care who how good y[ou]- -[th]ey are
sw2335B-ms98-a-0032 126.146625 137.622750 event[ually]- at least one time but now if it's a repeated thing here with this child in juvenile and all thi[s]- to me yeah both of them_1 because_1 that means she's still not doing what she's supposed to do
sw2335B-ms98-a-0033 137.622750 147.904875 because_1 i just watched it on TV one night on one of them um Twenty Twenty Forty Eight Hours one of them [vocalized-noise] shows where this boy had been stealing cars
sw2335B-ms98-a-0034 147.904875 159.003625 i don't know if you seen [vocalized-noise] they was the g[ang]- a little it was a little gang of them_1 stealing cars you know and then when they caught him you know his mother sitting there now they're gonna take me away from you that means she was warned
sw2335B-ms98-a-0035 159.003625 162.804250 but see by that i think th[at]- sometimes it a little late
sw2335B-ms98-a-0036 162.804250 165.927000 you know but i'm sure there's something can be done
sw2335B-ms98-a-0037 165.927000 170.811125 [silence]
sw2335B-ms98-a-0038 170.811125 177.991750 yeah start prosecuting they but really good instead of having a revolving door on the damn court system
sw2335B-ms98-a-0039 177.991750 181.150875 [silence]
sw2335B-ms98-a-0040 181.150875 191.498625 well they should start with the th[e]- if they would get rid of seems to me i know there's a lot about courts that people don't understand there's more people in jail right now for child support 
sw2335B-ms98-a-0041 191.498625 195.277625 okay_1 [noise] then there are for people doing drugs
sw2335B-ms98-a-0042 195.277625 199.901625 they ought to take all them little misdemeanor people let them_1 go let them_1 go
sw2335B-ms98-a-0043 199.901625 212.071500 you know give them_1 a fine whatever make them_1 do civic duty whatever put them fools in there that's what they need to put i c[all]- i call them_1 all fools idiots whatever little rock stars put all them_1 in there
sw2335B-ms98-a-0044 212.071500 219.829125 you know the murderers the the drug dealers the user put them_1 all in jail you know and let all the normal people go
sw2335B-ms98-a-0045 219.829125 222.422375 you know because_1 okay
sw2335B-ms98-a-0046 222.422375 225.706625 if you write a bad check you go to jail right
sw2335B-ms98-a-0047 225.706625 229.172000 okay_1 let them people go
sw2335B-ms98-a-0048 229.172000 237.522500 not let them_1 go and get out of it let them go and pay their crime or their time doing something else
sw2335B-ms98-a-0049 237.522500 246.075375 you know like cleaning up the city or however they do they community time you know whatever that is [laughter] but
sw2335B-ms98-a-0050 246.075375 249.477750 put don't put them in jail because they're not hardened criminals
sw2335B-ms98-a-0051 249.477750 256.518250 [silence]
sw2335B-ms98-a-0052 256.518250 258.265875 um-hum
sw2335B-ms98-a-0053 258.265875 259.567000 so
sw2335B-ms98-a-0054 259.567000 265.574250 i don't know them people boy they got th[e]- i think the United States has got too many problems to be worried about everybody else
sw2335B-ms98-a-0055 265.574250 266.821500 [silence]
sw2335B-ms98-a-0056 266.821500 271.781250 now how they gonna fix it i don't know the i don't think there is a ready solution
sw2335B-ms98-a-0057 271.781250 273.188500 [silence]
sw2335B-ms98-a-0058 273.188500 280.738125 because_1 the economy is down people you know the the the low man on the pole is getting more of the i guess the bulk of it
sw2335B-ms98-a-0059 280.738125 284.976250 uh he's gonna have to work extra hard just to make ends meet
sw2335B-ms98-a-0060 284.976250 286.252875 [silence]
sw2335B-ms98-a-0061 286.252875 287.984500 um-hum

sw2335B-ms98-a-0067 297.056750 302.577125 so you know they i i know that's bad but you know th[e]- just like Texas now

sw2335B-ms98-a-0069 307.642000 314.720000 i would rather pay for a lottery a dollar two three dollars whatever i'm paying you know a week or whatever
sw2335B-ms98-a-0070 314.720000 320.519125 and never see any of that money than to have them take a portion of my paycheck
sw2335B-ms98-a-0071 320.519125 329.137250 because [laughter-you] [laughter-know] they take and Uncle Sam takes his the Social Security which probably won't be here when i get that old you know
sw2335B-ms98-a-0072 329.137250 333.885625 because_1 we're paying for Social Security they using now who's gonna pay for mine
sw2335B-ms98-a-0073 333.885625 345.314125 yeah [laughter] but it's it's [laughter] nah you don't count on Social Security but it's it's that's what i'm saying they need to do something else
sw2335B-ms98-a-0074 345.314125 346.621750 but
sw2335B-ms98-a-0075 346.621750 347.647875 [silence]
sw2335B-ms98-a-0076 347.647875 351.612000 crime is gonna go up as long as the economy stays down
sw2335B-ms98-a-0077 351.612000 358.359375 and it's gonna get worse that's just like last night they killed them people in that store where you at
sw2335B-ms98-a-0078 358.359375 359.906000 [silence]

sw2335B-ms98-a-0094 425.949500 428.928500 well i think if it's the town is smaller
sw2335B-ms98-a-0095 428.928500 434.312750 and everybody knows everybody it's harder to come in there and do something
sw2335B-ms98-a-0096 434.312750 438.810500 where i[s]- and and and see that's another thing neighborhoods aren't neighborhoods anymore
sw2335B-ms98-a-0097 438.810500 442.890625 there's nobody next door to you you don't know your neighbors and stuff like that
