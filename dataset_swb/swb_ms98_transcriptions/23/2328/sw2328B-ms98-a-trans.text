sw2328B-ms98-a-0020 71.548375 74.835625 yeah
sw2328B-ms98-a-0021 74.835625 86.497000 i he definitely i had an unusual situation w[ith]- in my home my father was was alcoholic but uh and very withdrawn at that and so my husband is ten times more involved and we have more of a
sw2328B-ms98-a-0022 86.497000 87.534875 [silence]
sw2328B-ms98-a-0023 87.534875 93.779750 uh i guess a Christian based home and so we try to make the family as important as we can
sw2328B-ms98-a-0024 93.779750 95.177250 and uh
sw2328B-ms98-a-0025 95.177250 107.955125 uh and i guess you don't have to have a Christian based home to to feel that way but that's just part of our priorities [laughter-that's] [laughter-right] [laughter] it certainly gives you some some spec[ific]- specific goals to work towards but uh
sw2328B-ms98-a-0026 107.955125 112.686875 he helps a lot with her he helps feeding her changing her and playing with her and
sw2328B-ms98-a-0027 112.686875 123.716750 and i think he has to be conscious of of uh needing to spend time with her if not then he gets wrapped up in the TV and the newspaper and whatever else and he says oh i didn't spend time with Emily
sw2328B-ms98-a-0028 123.716750 127.560625 but if he forgets i try to to [laughter-help] [laughter-him] [laughter-remember]
sw2328B-ms98-a-0029 127.560625 129.299375 [silence] 
sw2328B-ms98-a-0030 129.299375 131.138875 i think so
sw2328B-ms98-a-0031 131.138875 142.405625 [noise]
sw2328B-ms98-a-0032 142.405625 151.093625 i think uh i've been reading a lot lately about the alcohol children of alcoholics syndrome i don't know if you've heard of that or not
sw2328B-ms98-a-0033 151.093625 164.525750 but uh trying to relate that to me and i think because i had a strong Christian background personally it affected me differently than it affected my sisters and i see myself uh with some of those qualities but with not quite as much anger
sw2328B-ms98-a-0034 164.525750 170.918375 as i see them towards him or towards my mother with certain things and uh
sw2328B-ms98-a-0035 170.918375 174.085500 as far as me personally i think
sw2328B-ms98-a-0036 174.085500 181.913750 it made me appreciate my husband more because he doesn't do [laughter-certain] things that my dad did so i
sw2328B-ms98-a-0037 181.913750 198.318750 [silence]
sw2328B-ms98-a-0038 198.318750 199.447500 uh-huh
sw2328B-ms98-a-0039 199.447500 218.174375 [silence]
sw2328B-ms98-a-0040 218.174375 226.842250 uh-huh i think that's that's how i feel too i feel a need to dominate certain things and i try real hard not to be to too domineering with with Emily
sw2328B-ms98-a-0041 226.842250 235.787500 because i don't want to my mother was also a domineering type of personality because she had to take over the things that my dad fell short in
sw2328B-ms98-a-0042 235.787500 242.772375 and i find you know i think okay i want Emily to be this way and this is what i'm going to do to make her be that way and then i think no you can't do that
sw2328B-ms98-a-0043 242.772375 251.781625 she has to develop her own personality and so sometimes i i have to step back and say okay we want to encourage her we want to influence her but we don't want to control her
sw2328B-ms98-a-0044 251.781625 264.738500 and so far it hasn't been too hard but she hasn't been making a whole lot of decisions on her own yet and so you know i guess i'm i'm just going to have to be real conscious of that as i as she gets older and does start making decisions
sw2328B-ms98-a-0045 264.738500 269.087000 and be conscious that i need to give her options but not make the decisions for her
sw2328B-ms98-a-0046 269.087000 276.562625 [silence]
sw2328B-ms98-a-0047 276.562625 284.365125 um i i look at myself and i have three sisters there's four daughters in the family i look at myself compared to my sisters' families
sw2328B-ms98-a-0048 284.365125 292.822250 and see that one of them married an abusive husband one of them married an alcoholic uh the other one married into a pretty stable relationship
sw2328B-ms98-a-0049 292.822250 301.439750 and mine is pretty stable or much more stable i think probably than any of them but now i waited until i was thirty to get married and they all married at eighteen but uh

sw2328B-ms98-a-0052 305.498625 313.103000 well my dad in his alcoholism he was kind of irritating and it there were a few times he was violent towards my mother but it was almost he like
sw2328B-ms98-a-0053 313.103000 325.981000 if he had any opinions to give he would tell my mother and she would tell us and so we had almost no direct relationship with him i mean he was there and and we you know did little things together as a family but on the whole there was no
sw2328B-ms98-a-0054 325.981000 334.000500 no direct communication no show of affection no even no show of anger unless it he was you know really really drunk

sw2328B-ms98-a-0085 492.050000 502.880500 uh-huh i think too that with us as women being out of the home where i'm not working now i didn't work until about from about the time Emily about four months before she was born
sw2328B-ms98-a-0086 502.880500 507.996500 and but so many women are having children and returning to the work field that the the dads
sw2328B-ms98-a-0087 507.996500 515.975250 you know have to to follow through or a third person has to come in and follow through with with the the care and the dads are are doing more
sw2328B-ms98-a-0088 515.975250 523.447750 and that bond is starting you know like you said right at the beginning and then developing it's not breaking at any point
sw2328B-ms98-a-0089 523.447750 535.447000 at least it shouldn't and and and and in a good family it isn't unfortunately there's so many families where there isn't a father in the home it's just yeah that's right yeah
