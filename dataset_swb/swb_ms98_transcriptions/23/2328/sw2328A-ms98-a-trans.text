sw2328A-ms98-a-0044 186.757375 190.955250 and at fifty she and she was an only child
sw2328A-ms98-a-0045 190.955250 203.891375 at fifty she's st[ill]- still having a lot of difficulty in her relationship with her husband that she feels stems from how she was treated by her father
sw2328A-ms98-a-0046 203.891375 218.756500 and how she feels that she has to control everything and from her readings she feels that that comes from the fact that her father was alcoholic over which of course she had no control

sw2328A-ms98-a-0083 333.431000 344.329625 my fa[ther]- my husband was like that but that was because he was working all the time establishing a business and running it certainly he i mean he got off work and he came home
sw2328A-ms98-a-0084 344.329625 353.304875 and he ate dinner and his work was outside and in the winter time by the time he was warm he was asleep so it wasn't that he was
sw2328A-ms98-a-0085 353.304875 366.603000 neglectful of his children by choice there just was no time and energy left for them by the time he put in his workday which started like at five thirty and ended at six thirty uh
sw2328A-ms98-a-0086 366.603000 380.830000 [vocalized-noise] you know alcoholism wasn't a problem resentment whatever was was not a problem at all because each one of our children was planned and he seemed to be the one who initiated having children so certainly he wanted them
sw2328A-ms98-a-0087 380.830000 392.808375 he just didn't have the energy to deal with them and of course now uh he's very ex[cited]- he's retired and he's spending time with his grandchildren which shows how much he wished that he could have with his own

sw2328A-ms98-a-0089 396.921750 400.359000 so he has overcome alcoholism at this point

sw2328A-ms98-a-0102 425.978875 435.575875 the first time i heard my older daughter tell and she is our most expressive tell my husband that she loved him he said well i certainly hope so
sw2328A-ms98-a-0103 435.575875 443.772250 so he but then he came from a background where he is so much more open with his children than his father was with him
sw2328A-ms98-a-0104 443.772250 451.167000 his father was just a very quiet withdrawn person and i assume very shy as is my husband
sw2328A-ms98-a-0105 451.167000 462.324500 uh he shows his feelings but he cannot express it and i think that's kind of sad in a way i see other fathers put their arms around their daughters or their sons and
sw2328A-ms98-a-0106 462.324500 473.615875 we have two daughters and a son and uh he just can't do that and i i know that he would if he could and i i kind of feel sorry for him because i think he misses a lot and
sw2328A-ms98-a-0107 473.615875 483.907000 as i say our our sons-in-law are so open and caring and giving to their children and i wonder if it's because they're there when they de[livered]- they're delivered if that

sw2328A-ms98-a-0121 536.002500 546.249375 it's certainly not a good situation but i'm sure it's not one that the the the families chose i mean i'm sure they felt they had no choice at our stage in life we've seen
sw2328A-ms98-a-0122 546.249375 553.955500 a lot of our friends go through divorces uh you know we've been married thirty five years and so that's how old our friends are
sw2328A-ms98-a-0123 553.955500 563.564125 and they're on their second marriage and they've got his kids and her kids and i think my gosh all the pain they've caused themselves and their children i just
sw2328A-ms98-a-0124 563.564125 572.916875 you know of course everything wasn't always rosy for us but you kn[ow]- we stayed together and at this point our children are saying gosh i'm glad you did that
sw2328A-ms98-a-0125 572.916875 578.608750 so i think it makes for a more solid basis for them or i hope so at least
