sw2316A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.837500 [silence]
sw2316A-ms98-a-0002 0.837500 13.837000 it's it's hard to[pic]- topic because is it is it is it doing a good job or a bad job and you got to divide it two different categories whether you live in the city or whether you live in a more rural place like i do
sw2316A-ms98-a-0003 13.837000 19.665375 [silence]
sw2316A-ms98-a-0004 19.665375 24.716000 well public school all the way up kindergarten all the way up to uh uh high school
sw2316A-ms98-a-0005 24.716000 27.631125 [silence]
sw2316A-ms98-a-0006 27.631125 30.595250 yes well yeah i am
sw2316A-ms98-a-0007 30.595250 43.262250 um act[ually]- actually i think that i at the higher level education i don't think there's so much of a problem there it's pretty much funded well there are small colleges that i'm sure are struggling
sw2316A-ms98-a-0008 43.262250 58.612500 but uh it's the job that the the high school and the grade schools are doing that i see in a area like ours our school even a bad school is a good school up here where if i lived in New York City or Washington DC
sw2316A-ms98-a-0009 58.612500 70.835000 uh i would seriously consider moving if i had a child i wouldn't let them go to a public school system there but of course people are trapped economically and they can't do that
sw2316A-ms98-a-0010 70.835000 94.750375 [silence]
sw2316A-ms98-a-0011 94.750375 108.398500 well that's really too bad because i[t]- it it's giving some people unfair advantage i mean we our high school up here is like a junior college in Florida what we learned
sw2316A-ms98-a-0012 108.398500 114.350625 [silence]
sw2316A-ms98-a-0013 114.350625 115.404750 yeah
sw2316A-ms98-a-0014 115.404750 124.600250 [silence]
sw2316A-ms98-a-0015 124.600250 125.447375 yeah
sw2316A-ms98-a-0016 125.447375 141.383375 [silence]
sw2316A-ms98-a-0017 141.383375 143.585000 oh they they have that down there that
sw2316A-ms98-a-0018 143.585000 157.574750 [silence]
sw2316A-ms98-a-0019 157.574750 169.870625 yeah it's like if if your father owns a grocery store and you're really interested in that there's no reason that you should take college prep courses when you can get some general business courses in high school
sw2316A-ms98-a-0020 169.870625 185.973750 [silence]
sw2316A-ms98-a-0021 185.973750 195.525500 yeah that's where i was fortunate i'm a i'm a technician and we had a vocational um electronics in our high school
sw2316A-ms98-a-0022 195.525500 204.703875 so when i went to my first year of tech school uh i had a very easy time because our high school had a a good program
sw2316A-ms98-a-0023 204.703875 214.647000 [silence]
sw2316A-ms98-a-0024 214.647000 221.532875 yeah i find that that the that in the in the cities it's more less the kids go there
sw2316A-ms98-a-0025 221.532875 230.701000 to socialize not really to learn and the parents send them_1 there because they're supposed to and plus it gets them out of their hair and i also find that
sw2316A-ms98-a-0026 230.701000 238.693750 that you can send a kid to school but if don't work with them as a parent i think you're putting your child at a big disadvantage
sw2316A-ms98-a-0027 238.693750 245.391250 [silence]
sw2316A-ms98-a-0028 245.391250 255.550250 yeah well i could i could see if a kid doesn't have any encouragement if [vocalized-noise] they're you know come from a broken home and their parents are more concerned about
sw2316A-ms98-a-0029 255.550250 270.043625 trying to work and or maybe they're unemployed and they're mad at the world i can see where that wouldn't be very good for a a kid you know he's coming up will you help me with my homework and they're no get away from me i've had a terrible day
sw2316A-ms98-a-0030 270.043625 275.834125 so it's got a lot to do with economics in the area that you come from
sw2316A-ms98-a-0031 275.834125 284.618000 [silence]
sw2316A-ms98-a-0032 284.618000 288.259750 yes are they going to move to uh Mexico [vocalized-noise]
sw2316A-ms98-a-0033 288.259750 294.561625 [silence]
sw2316A-ms98-a-0034 294.561625 295.593250 [vocalized-noise]
sw2316A-ms98-a-0035 295.593250 299.595125 [silence]
sw2316A-ms98-a-0036 299.595125 300.136375 [vocalized-noise]
sw2316A-ms98-a-0037 300.136375 308.724500 [silence]
sw2316A-ms98-a-0038 308.724500 315.744625 yeah maybe the maybe they'll bring their good schools with them [laughter] you know if the industry comes
sw2316A-ms98-a-0039 315.744625 327.233375 hopefully they'll promote good schools because i know the town that i come from the the uh the large IBM plant has something to do with the top rated high school
sw2316A-ms98-a-0040 327.233375 337.552875 because of their tax base for one and plus for for the type of student that's going to that school it's going to raise the level of the school
sw2316A-ms98-a-0041 337.552875 346.554375 because your parents are engineers or chemists they're they're you're most likely to do better in school they're going to help you
sw2316A-ms98-a-0042 346.554375 347.963750 [silence]
sw2316A-ms98-a-0043 347.963750 356.688000 yeah you hope [laughter] well i think i- i don't know i just think it it's it's a duty of the parent to do that
sw2316A-ms98-a-0044 356.688000 367.594125 i mean jeez my parents always helped me and i don't know it's just like you say it's the way you're raised and the economic situation you're in
sw2316A-ms98-a-0045 367.594125 382.508125 i can see some lady she's twenty one years old and she's got four kids a kid in her first grader i don't see where she's going to have much time for him [laughter] so i don't know it's just like
sw2316A-ms98-a-0046 382.508125 391.664625 [silence]
sw2316A-ms98-a-0047 391.664625 406.623875 i don't know actually i think it i think it should be a civic level the city level and a a system level really to find out and t[o]- to see what they need and not overinflate it
sw2316A-ms98-a-0048 406.623875 419.137625 like if the teachers are getting six percent raises every year when people in industry have been getting cut back and you're getting raises every eighteen months you got to go hey now wait a minute we're in a recession here 
sw2316A-ms98-a-0049 419.137625 431.590750 we uh our town didn't pass the school budget this year and for the first time in many many years just because people are are in the recession and they're even though
sw2316A-ms98-a-0050 431.590750 443.754375 we've uh enjoyed very good employment here for the past ten years now we got eight percent uh unemployment when it used to be four or five people are going whoa
sw2316A-ms98-a-0051 443.754375 444.550000 [silence]
sw2316A-ms98-a-0052 444.550000 445.410250 so
sw2316A-ms98-a-0053 445.410250 447.387625 [silence]
sw2316A-ms98-a-0054 447.387625 459.028375 yeah but i always [noise] see it's all it's all money this like a couple other topics we had talked about was crime It it's it's all money based
sw2316A-ms98-a-0055 459.028375 470.166625 and what you can do unless you just get down to the parent level and and then if you're in a bad situation where you have to send your child to a bad school
sw2316A-ms98-a-0056 470.166625 481.593625 who knows bu[t]- maybe we do we need some more Catholic schools support the church instead [laughter] they seem to have done a the good job in the past
sw2316A-ms98-a-0057 481.593625 494.624125 in uh some places uh you couldn't go to a public school it was miles down the road and the only school you could go to was the Baptist school or the Catholic school so
sw2316A-ms98-a-0058 494.624125 496.014750 [silence]
sw2316A-ms98-a-0059 496.014750 498.392375 yeah the i don't
sw2316A-ms98-a-0060 498.392375 500.556250 [silence]
sw2316A-ms98-a-0061 500.556250 501.207000 [vocalized-noise]
sw2316A-ms98-a-0062 501.207000 502.243375 [silence]
sw2316A-ms98-a-0063 502.243375 515.336625 yeah i don't know if i would do that to my [laughter-child] [laughter-though] [laughter] but so hum pretty much though see i don't have any good ideas or 
sw2316A-ms98-a-0064 515.336625 528.989375 or anything that would contribute see this isn't a subject that i think a lot about because i'm never faced with it because our school system in Vermont it seems to do a really good job
sw2316A-ms98-a-0065 528.989375 542.976375 [silence]
sw2316A-ms98-a-0066 542.976375 543.881000 is it
sw2316A-ms98-a-0067 543.881000 552.979375 [silence]
sw2316A-ms98-a-0068 552.979375 553.544500 well that
sw2316A-ms98-a-0069 553.544500 563.432625 [silence]
sw2316A-ms98-a-0070 563.432625 563.962500 well
sw2316A-ms98-a-0071 563.962500 577.051500 [silence]
sw2316A-ms98-a-0072 577.051500 591.310000 so you have to go to a lesser engineering school we have a very good public school up here and a degree out there means a lot it's a very good school it's it's University of Vermont um
sw2316A-ms98-a-0073 591.310000 598.537500 we also have some two year college well there's a four year colleges they all have a pretty good reputation but like you say you
