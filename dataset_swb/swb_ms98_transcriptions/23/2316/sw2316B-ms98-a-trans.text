sw2316B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 13.655625 [silence]
sw2316B-ms98-a-0002 13.655625 19.530375 yeah and are you talking about public schools being lower level high school level or
sw2316B-ms98-a-0003 19.530375 20.386750 [noise]
sw2316B-ms98-a-0004 20.386750 21.421375 state school
sw2316B-ms98-a-0005 21.421375 24.706375 [silence]
sw2316B-ms98-a-0006 24.706375 27.680250 okay but you're excluding high-level education
sw2316B-ms98-a-0007 27.680250 30.794125 [silence]
sw2316B-ms98-a-0008 30.794125 31.539875 okay
sw2316B-ms98-a-0009 31.539875 68.652250 [silence]
sw2316B-ms98-a-0010 68.652250 82.765125 yeah i know down here the school's are you know i don't know they rate i moved to Arkansas and Texas after living in Ohio and the schools down here rate you know bottom ten percent across the country and
sw2316B-ms98-a-0011 82.765125 94.926500 having been through grade school up there and coming down here to high school i can understand why because they're so far behind and so poorly staffed half the time the teachers don't know what's going on
sw2316B-ms98-a-0012 94.926500 106.137625 [silence]
sw2316B-ms98-a-0013 106.137625 107.412750 right
sw2316B-ms98-a-0014 107.412750 114.741750 well that was my experience going through junior high up there when i came down south for high school i was just repeating what i'd already done
sw2316B-ms98-a-0015 114.741750 124.812750 because we were so far advanced and uh the you know i'd been in a parochial school before junior high and you know even the public schools are behind the parochial schools
sw2316B-ms98-a-0016 124.812750 134.902375 so you know i- i like the concept they've got now where they have more directed education you know you you pick a career path or you get counseling earlier
sw2316B-ms98-a-0017 134.902375 141.587375 and then you you learn the things that help you rather than spending four years learning the same things over and over
sw2316B-ms98-a-0018 141.587375 142.965500 [silence]
sw2316B-ms98-a-0019 142.965500 155.531375 well they talk about it and there are a few in some of the more like in i live in a big metroplex and some of the the better parts of the metroplex the the suburbs that are richer have those kind of target schools
sw2316B-ms98-a-0020 155.531375 157.984125 but uh you know
sw2316B-ms98-a-0021 157.984125 167.058875 [silence]
sw2316B-ms98-a-0022 167.058875 168.399125 right
sw2316B-ms98-a-0023 168.399125 181.231875 or if you're going to go the science route you can go to a target school that specializes in science or art you know there's no point in you know i'm an engineering student and if i have to go take art classes you know i'm not going to use them_1
sw2316B-ms98-a-0024 181.231875 186.286500 and through high school i could have gone so much further if i'd gone to a school that was directed
sw2316B-ms98-a-0025 186.286500 194.381875 [silence]
sw2316B-ms98-a-0026 194.381875 195.816250 right in high school
sw2316B-ms98-a-0027 195.816250 202.076250 [silence]
sw2316B-ms98-a-0028 202.076250 203.390500 right
sw2316B-ms98-a-0029 203.390500 204.403625 [silence]
sw2316B-ms98-a-0030 204.403625 214.587750 i think the schools today you know the public schools are just they're just overrun you know they don't know what to do there's too many kids and not enough teachers and too many kids don't care
sw2316B-ms98-a-0031 214.587750 215.361375 [silence]
sw2316B-ms98-a-0032 215.361375 215.952500 and

sw2316B-ms98-a-0036 237.997625 245.508625 yeah and you know there's some kids that you know want to go learn but most of them_1 just want to go play
sw2316B-ms98-a-0037 245.508625 275.096750 [silence]
sw2316B-ms98-a-0038 275.096750 284.687875 yeah that's true i'm wondering with the boom down here it's well not at the moment but a lot of the industry's moving southward
sw2316B-ms98-a-0039 284.687875 286.125375 [silence]
sw2316B-ms98-a-0040 286.125375 288.901000 so oh i don't know
sw2316B-ms98-a-0041 288.901000 302.688250 about that but a lot of the industry up in uh you know the northern states is moving south [noise] and i'm wondering if that's going to have any effect you know on what you see now we're we're we're behind down here
sw2316B-ms98-a-0042 302.688250 309.833375 i say we because_1 i live here if that might not turn around in the next you know fifteen twenty years
sw2316B-ms98-a-0043 309.833375 315.336750 [silence]
sw2316B-ms98-a-0044 315.336750 316.649375 yeah

sw2316B-ms98-a-0048 347.274750 348.158000 you hope
sw2316B-ms98-a-0049 348.158000 382.355875 [silence]
sw2316B-ms98-a-0050 382.355875 391.666125 i guess you just have to wonder is it up to the is it you know who whose supposed to make the change the the state the govern[ment]- the federal government you know where's the money supposed to come from is it
sw2316B-ms98-a-0051 391.666125 395.709500 you know what what do you advocate more taxes or better management of what they got
sw2316B-ms98-a-0052 395.709500 414.045500 [silence]
sw2316B-ms98-a-0053 414.045500 415.635875 yeah [laughter]

sw2316B-ms98-a-0055 443.685750 444.319375 yeah
sw2316B-ms98-a-0056 444.319375 445.538875 [silence]
sw2316B-ms98-a-0057 445.538875 447.152750 starts hitting closer to home
sw2316B-ms98-a-0058 447.152750 494.124000 [silence]
sw2316B-ms98-a-0059 494.124000 495.721375 yeah they're a lot more strict
sw2316B-ms98-a-0060 495.721375 496.760875 [silence]
sw2316B-ms98-a-0061 496.760875 502.382125 you uh have to learn you aren't given the chance to you know screw off all the time
sw2316B-ms98-a-0062 502.382125 528.518875 [silence]
sw2316B-ms98-a-0063 528.518875 543.459250 well i know i'm in the you know the only reason i asked about secondary schools or you know advanced education is because down here you know going to the University of Texas the education i'm getting i think is kind of shoddy for a public school
sw2316B-ms98-a-0064 543.459250 551.860625 i- i don't think i'm getting what i should but you know in Texas it's next to free because th[ey]- they pay so much of it it's state supported
sw2316B-ms98-a-0065 551.860625 552.718875 [silence]
sw2316B-ms98-a-0066 552.718875 563.192125 but at the same time it's really not it's not like going to MIT my engineering degree will be nothing like somebody coming out of MIT and that's it's really too bad
sw2316B-ms98-a-0067 563.192125 577.046125 but that's i don't know i think it just builds on the foundation that they've already built you get people out of high schools and col[lege]- junior colleges that don't have the background for an MIT kind of curriculum so
sw2316B-ms98-a-0068 577.046125 598.537500 [silence]
