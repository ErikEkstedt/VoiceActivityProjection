sw2338B-ms98-a-0008 19.869375 27.734500 yeah the the i mean people like that are crazy i i did a study on it though when i was in high school it was one of these things
sw2338B-ms98-a-0009 27.734500 31.201250 we had to pick a topic to to investigate
sw2338B-ms98-a-0010 31.201250 41.009125 and uh at that time i don't think it's like that any more but at that time uh it was very unfair capital punishment was a lot more common 
sw2338B-ms98-a-0011 41.009125 51.465750 and if you ten[ded]- and it tended to be that if you were ignorant or if you were a foreigner or if you were black or any minority for that matter
sw2338B-ms98-a-0012 51.465750 62.943375 the chances your chances of of uh getting the death penalty were you know like hundreds of times greater than if you could just communicate well
sw2338B-ms98-a-0013 62.943375 74.633375 i mean you didn't have to be um you didn't even necessarily have to be white but if you could just communicate and you could come across in the court room with some kind of um
sw2338B-ms98-a-0014 74.633375 75.118875 [noise]
sw2338B-ms98-a-0015 75.118875 88.848375 you know sense about you then even if you did the exact same crime chances are you wouldn't get you'd get life instead of the death penalty as a opposed to somebody who couldn't communicate well
sw2338B-ms98-a-0016 88.848375 93.162000 and at that time it just seemed so f[air]- unfair
sw2338B-ms98-a-0017 93.162000 98.557250 that um i i felt like i couldn't uh um
sw2338B-ms98-a-0018 98.557250 100.941125 you know i just didn't agree with it
sw2338B-ms98-a-0019 100.941125 104.975000 it's gotten so though that there are so many
sw2338B-ms98-a-0020 104.975000 108.142375 you know there are so many uh
sw2338B-ms98-a-0021 108.142375 120.669625 i don't know what you call it uh so many different things that you have to go through before they actually give the death penalty that i'm not so sure it it seems a lot fairer than it [laughter-used] [laughter-to] [laughter-be]

sw2338B-ms98-a-0029 150.025875 157.490625 right yeah you know give them give them i mean you should give somebody every every chance even even if it seems obvious
sw2338B-ms98-a-0030 157.490625 168.130625 um i don't know what the what the law is like in Texas i mean i certainly haven't heard anyth[ing]- any anything about somebody being executed or anything

sw2338B-ms98-a-0035 177.785625 188.104625 well you know the um there was something on TV last night about how one state what there was a newspaper in no it was a TV station
sw2338B-ms98-a-0036 188.104625 189.499250 yo[u]- did you see that

sw2338B-ms98-a-0040 197.274625 204.238375 well yeah but you know there there are so many people who just get get their jollies off of watching that

sw2338B-ms98-a-0042 205.238375 210.146000 and that's what that's what really bothers me you know i'm all for deterrents
sw2338B-ms98-a-0043 210.146000 214.418250 but i i think what's going to happen is it's going to turn it into a circus
sw2338B-ms98-a-0044 214.418250 215.468500 and
sw2338B-ms98-a-0045 215.468500 217.559250 [silence]

sw2338B-ms98-a-0052 226.578875 239.682000 well where i could see it being very useful is for you know wh[en]- if there's a first time offender part of his punishment is that he's [laughter-got] [laughter-to] see what you know what he's up against 
sw2338B-ms98-a-0053 239.682000 247.596875 you know what what you know what might happen but th[e]- you know for TV sta[tion]- you know that TV station isn't going to want to restrict how they use it
sw2338B-ms98-a-0054 247.596875 253.916250 and they're going to show it on the six o['clock]- well probably not the six o'clock news but they'll show it on the eleven o'clock eleven o'clock news
sw2338B-ms98-a-0055 253.916250 257.288500 and i don't you know i've got a ten year old and
sw2338B-ms98-a-0056 257.288500 261.161625 you know she's she could very well be up at that time
sw2338B-ms98-a-0057 261.161625 268.899500 you know when we're and that's just not the kind of thing for a ten year old i'm not sure it's the kind of thing for a sixteen year old [laughter]
sw2338B-ms98-a-0058 268.899500 269.984125 right

sw2338B-ms98-a-0061 272.407875 279.924125 right and in fact i think it'd be harmful if my if you know if my daughter or my any of my kids saw it
sw2338B-ms98-a-0062 279.924125 283.590875 so that has to be brought into the picture too
sw2338B-ms98-a-0063 283.590875 294.976000 you know you just can't blatantly say let's let's show it and and the the right people will see it and it'll deter them from committing a crime all lot of the wrong people are going to see it too and uh

sw2338B-ms98-a-0080 345.352125 358.224375 yeah well you know i i think that if if i felt like the the the system was was truly fair and and uh and that they would never make a mistake [laughter] then
sw2338B-ms98-a-0081 358.224375 368.212375 you know but you hear you know you hear about people who are who are genuinely uh mistakenly accused of a crime and

sw2338B-ms98-a-0087 379.729500 382.758500 that's right and and it turns out he didn't do it
sw2338B-ms98-a-0088 382.758500 390.821375 or you know and and it's easy you know and and you know let's face it not all policemen are honest and
sw2338B-ms98-a-0089 390.821375 391.960250 that's right
sw2338B-ms98-a-0090 391.960250 401.280375 and and you know they can they'll take somebody who maybe is mentally retarded and and then it's and they're under pressure to to solve a crime
sw2338B-ms98-a-0091 401.280375 413.128250 and some and the circumstances uh may be molded to blame somebody who didn't do it and especially if it's you know somebody who's mentally retarded who can't defend themselves very well
sw2338B-ms98-a-0092 413.128250 418.123375 and i'd hate to see them get the ultimate punishment and it turns out it wasn't them

sw2338B-ms98-a-0100 436.346500 443.292625 and uh it it it just doesn't seem right that our tax money or somebody's tax money goes to keep him alive
sw2338B-ms98-a-0101 443.292625 446.726125 you know he gets three meals a day and and he probably
sw2338B-ms98-a-0102 446.726125 448.328750 [silence]
sw2338B-ms98-a-0103 448.328750 454.784000 right right that's right and he's probably living a lot better than some people who deserve a lot more
sw2338B-ms98-a-0104 454.784000 463.260625 and uh that does you know that does sort of you know but how you know it's just so hard [laughter] it's just so hard to to be fair and uh
sw2338B-ms98-a-0105 463.260625 468.773000 yeah i guess i wouldn't i wouldn't mind if if all of a sudden he didn't exist any more uh

sw2338B-ms98-a-0107 470.165625 476.432250 no no uh i you know i i think the same thing about people like Saddam Hussein
sw2338B-ms98-a-0108 476.432250 481.117250 you know you know th[e]- jeez you know they're just they're just the scum of the earth
sw2338B-ms98-a-0109 481.117250 486.889875 and uh i just hate the idea that my tax money might go to support somebody like that

sw2338B-ms98-a-0111 489.034875 490.774000 [laughter]

sw2338B-ms98-a-0120 510.985250 517.443625 i think you're right i don't think we're i think we're we'd we'd overstep our bounds if we went in and did that
sw2338B-ms98-a-0121 517.443625 519.411625 though it's awfully tempting

sw2338B-ms98-a-0131 533.986500 538.064000 well right now we're in a delicate situation because we've got this
sw2338B-ms98-a-0132 538.064000 542.974000 we['ve]- for the first time we're sort of aligned with a lot of these Arab countries

sw2338B-ms98-a-0137 552.212875 554.012125 it's complicated

sw2338B-ms98-a-0147 571.725750 579.360500 yeah there and you know it's a he's got that delicate balance right there and we'd just be overstepping our bounds i think if we walked in and sort of took over
sw2338B-ms98-a-0148 579.360500 583.215500 [silence]
sw2338B-ms98-a-0149 583.215500 590.115125 yeah i just can't imagine that they'd let him rule any longer you know if if they had you know if they could do something about it
sw2338B-ms98-a-0150 590.115125 600.188000 i mean his own army is going to eventually turn on him because and and you s[ee]- this has happened before in history you know that it just gets to a certain point where you're just not willing
