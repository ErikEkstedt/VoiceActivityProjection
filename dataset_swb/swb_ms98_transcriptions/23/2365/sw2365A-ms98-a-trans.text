sw2365A-ms98-a-0003 30.399750 33.783500 you didn't try we {rewallpapering} you just uh
sw2365A-ms98-a-0004 33.783500 35.320875 [silence]
sw2365A-ms98-a-0005 35.320875 37.493875 did you use a textured paint or
sw2365A-ms98-a-0006 37.493875 44.587750 [silence]
sw2365A-ms98-a-0007 44.587750 45.600375 um
sw2365A-ms98-a-0008 45.600375 46.817125 [silence]
sw2365A-ms98-a-0009 46.817125 48.642375 well did you get good results
sw2365A-ms98-a-0010 48.642375 56.366500 [silence]
sw2365A-ms98-a-0011 56.366500 57.507875 yeah
sw2365A-ms98-a-0012 57.507875 61.812375 [silence]
sw2365A-ms98-a-0013 61.812375 64.389500 but just didn't it didn't it didn't cover it
sw2365A-ms98-a-0014 64.389500 73.519250 [silence]
sw2365A-ms98-a-0015 73.519250 75.372625 well we did a uh
sw2365A-ms98-a-0016 75.372625 89.890125 we moved oh last August and we're getting a house my house had this dark wood paneling at the end of the den and we decided we went to i've forgotten one of the paint stores and they just said oh you can get by and i forgotten what it was you put down
sw2365A-ms98-a-0017 89.890125 93.121875 and then you can just paint right over the dark
sw2365A-ms98-a-0018 93.121875 107.018125 well more or less after about uh half dozen coats it looks reasonable but it kept the the dark it was uh just a real dark uh wood grain type paneling
sw2365A-ms98-a-0019 107.018125 118.307000 and uh it was smooth and uh and we would we put this stuff on and and it supposedly textured it or or did something to it and 
sw2365A-ms98-a-0020 118.307000 123.654500 but because of the th[e]- dark behind it was really really hard to cover 
sw2365A-ms98-a-0021 123.654500 125.228000 and
sw2365A-ms98-a-0022 125.228000 137.743000 yeah it was something like that although we sort of when we got through i wished we hadn't done it because we were you know we were trying to make the house look nice to sell it and we were painting it and trying to do uh you know make it and it it really was
sw2365A-ms98-a-0023 137.743000 143.678750 you know the advice they give you is uh the job was considerably tougher than we thought
sw2365A-ms98-a-0024 143.678750 150.335250 uh particularly when you try to i was talking to somebody else who who had a lot of wood paneling and
sw2365A-ms98-a-0025 150.335250 162.418250 uh they had gotten somebody to come in with an estimate and it seemed like there was it was a good sized den with a lot paneling and the people quoted thirty thousand dollars to paint it or something
sw2365A-ms98-a-0026 162.418250 163.463375 [silence]
sw2365A-ms98-a-0027 163.463375 167.977500 have you have you tried getting outside estimates to see what it costs to have something painted
sw2365A-ms98-a-0028 167.977500 178.694500 [silence]
sw2365A-ms98-a-0029 178.694500 179.693125 yeah
sw2365A-ms98-a-0030 179.693125 185.732375 [silence]
sw2365A-ms98-a-0031 185.732375 186.818250 yeah
sw2365A-ms98-a-0032 186.818250 191.718875 [silence]
sw2365A-ms98-a-0033 191.718875 193.966125 oh that's quite reasonable
sw2365A-ms98-a-0034 193.966125 197.020625 [vocalized-noise] 
sw2365A-ms98-a-0035 197.020625 198.263375 um
sw2365A-ms98-a-0036 198.263375 201.889875 the problem is have you have you tried matching paint lately
sw2365A-ms98-a-0037 201.889875 216.648000 my wife we we built a shed over the long way actually it took [laughter] this is not on the topic but i did finish it but my wife went to the uh Home Depot i think it was and and took a uh a copy of took a piece of brick 
sw2365A-ms98-a-0038 216.648000 225.532750 and she wanted to paint the shed it's a it's a wooden shed uh and she took it and they've got this machine that matches the color of paint
sw2365A-ms98-a-0039 225.532750 237.790875 and uh they got and uh and in fact she put some right ba[ck]- she got they mixed uh a gallon of it and uh it's just remarkable how close it will match the paint
sw2365A-ms98-a-0040 237.790875 242.966750 uh and it does it uh oh electronically some something magic
sw2365A-ms98-a-0041 242.966750 246.372750 yeah you know they it but it's electronic 
sw2365A-ms98-a-0042 246.372750 253.391125 uh you put your sample under this thing and it looks at it and and uh and determines the
sw2365A-ms98-a-0043 253.391125 260.062625 and it it's really remarkable uh the problem they had and then they wanted some gray to do the to do the trim
sw2365A-ms98-a-0044 260.062625 267.078000 and uh but they didn't didn't occur to them that um that they could have taken a sample
sw2365A-ms98-a-0045 267.078000 275.905250 um from i forgotten this is Sherwin Williams Paint or something but anyway it's it's remarkable that's one of the problems though when you start painting to try to get the
sw2365A-ms98-a-0046 275.905250 286.554250 you know you want this you want this to look like this and you want that to look like that and of course if it's all white you're all right but when you start getting into colors have you had problems getting colors to match
sw2365A-ms98-a-0047 286.554250 302.717500 [silence]
sw2365A-ms98-a-0048 302.717500 304.067875 um
sw2365A-ms98-a-0049 304.067875 305.351375 so
sw2365A-ms98-a-0050 305.351375 306.953875 [silence]
sw2365A-ms98-a-0051 306.953875 308.328250 gosh
sw2365A-ms98-a-0052 308.328250 311.883500 so you so what's your what's the solution then
sw2365A-ms98-a-0053 311.883500 315.341875 [silence]
sw2365A-ms98-a-0054 315.341875 316.979125 oh my
sw2365A-ms98-a-0055 316.979125 320.129000 well at least you'll get very good at it right
sw2365A-ms98-a-0056 320.129000 333.719875 you could go back and and paint the whole thing over that's uh this is an interesting topic that they would bring up painting because it uh it seems like everybody has a you know to go in and do i'll just do a little bit here and a little that
sw2365A-ms98-a-0057 333.719875 342.494875 although the uh it's uh it we almost one day we we painted the house to uh we painted we painted the whole inside 
sw2365A-ms98-a-0058 342.494875 356.479000 and it had all this dark trim we thought uh you know we did the one wall but the other trim i'm trying to think i think i think we left most of it because it gets to be uh they don't do that in the newer houses now we don't uh the mold everything is white in a new house everything is white 
sw2365A-ms98-a-0059 356.479000 359.130625 [silence]
sw2365A-ms98-a-0060 359.130625 368.706000 oh good luck [laughter] we wound up selling the house actually i i don't know whether it made actually it does it's interesting that the white um
sw2365A-ms98-a-0061 368.706000 382.710000 makes the rooms look bigger one of the in our down stairs in our dining room we have a formal dining room it has molding uh like picture frames i don't know what you call that that actually that are along the walls that you know up a couple of feet 
sw2365A-ms98-a-0062 382.710000 388.860375 and my wife painted those the insides of those dark blue
sw2365A-ms98-a-0063 388.860375 391.423000 and uh
sw2365A-ms98-a-0064 391.423000 394.858000 [vocalized-noise] it makes the room look remarkably smaller 
sw2365A-ms98-a-0065 394.858000 398.020000 [silence]
sw2365A-ms98-a-0066 398.020000 399.558625 the trim is still white
sw2365A-ms98-a-0067 399.558625 408.849625 the the molding but by and she did that all the way around the room which makes it look very attractive but it makes the room look smaller which is uh
sw2365A-ms98-a-0068 408.849625 414.604250 uh which is it explains why they why they have everything white but i you wouldn't think that i well
sw2365A-ms98-a-0069 414.604250 417.780000 maybe maybe somebody that understands colors would know all of that stuff but 
sw2365A-ms98-a-0070 417.780000 421.169375 [silence]
sw2365A-ms98-a-0071 421.169375 430.009625 uh not particularly because the house has so many windows uh it has the the the living room has four uh good size windows
sw2365A-ms98-a-0072 430.009625 433.965500 and uh well of course at night but with the
sw2365A-ms98-a-0073 433.965500 440.908750 we have we have we have a soccer field that's um oh about a hundred yards from our house
sw2365A-ms98-a-0074 440.908750 443.179875 and the lights shine right at our house it's kind of
sw2365A-ms98-a-0075 443.179875 445.406125 we didn't know that when we bought the house but
sw2365A-ms98-a-0076 445.406125 450.590375 [silence]
sw2365A-ms98-a-0077 450.590375 460.357250 yeah we have a lot of light yeah and well it it it um well it's just uh i think it's just the the the dark blue to about three feet and then above that we left it white so
sw2365A-ms98-a-0078 460.357250 472.095250 anyway it didn't it didn't change but the the interesting thing is that paint we wound up having to go back and and scrape some of that away it didn't it kind of bled under the masking tape which i guess is probably the topic we're 
sw2365A-ms98-a-0079 472.095250 477.866125 we're really on to that that the masking is you have to do that very very carefully
sw2365A-ms98-a-0080 477.866125 479.475750 [silence]
sw2365A-ms98-a-0081 479.475750 486.180875 that's right you can work yourself to death well i'm sorry to hear your color didn't come out so good over the weekend
sw2365A-ms98-a-0082 486.180875 487.207375 [silence]
sw2365A-ms98-a-0083 487.207375 488.652500 it's kind of frustrating
sw2365A-ms98-a-0084 488.652500 490.582750 [silence]
sw2365A-ms98-a-0085 490.582750 493.784625 well i've got to go to a meeting it's been good talking to you
sw2365A-ms98-a-0086 493.784625 495.458250 okay good-bye
sw2365A-ms98-a-0087 495.458250 496.511000 [noise]
