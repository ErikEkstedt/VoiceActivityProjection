sw2395B-ms98-a-0004 10.380875 12.033875 i'm in Dallas
sw2395B-ms98-a-0005 12.033875 14.364875 are you in Dallas also
sw2395B-ms98-a-0006 14.364875 16.839750 oh really okay

sw2395B-ms98-a-0013 38.559625 48.483750 i normally find that uh i- i'm probably the most um news hungry of my friends so i don't we don't normally talk about the news at lunch
sw2395B-ms98-a-0014 48.483750 57.427875 i i find that i have to only subscribe to the paper on the weekend simply because i used to get it during the week
sw2395B-ms98-a-0015 57.427875 66.326875 but um i would always end up arriving at work late because i would always end up skimming the headlines spending too much time reading it in the morning
sw2395B-ms98-a-0016 66.326875 76.982875 so i have to cut myself down to the weekend plus after work um the MacNeil Lehrer news hour is on uh public television and i enjoy that quite a bit

sw2395B-ms98-a-0020 88.978125 92.773000 i will admit i work with uh someone who's Iranian
sw2395B-ms98-a-0021 92.773000 102.085625 and he definitely has a very different slant on the news he's very very skeptical of the news media and i will admit i'm reasonably skeptical also
sw2395B-ms98-a-0022 102.085625 104.909500 but he's i don't know uh he's
sw2395B-ms98-a-0023 104.909500 119.369625 mu[ch]- much much more so it's it's sort of interesting though because he does bring a a much um different perspective with all the Gulf goings on um 
sw2395B-ms98-a-0024 119.369625 128.701625 he was always speaking in terms of you know American imperialism reasserting itself and i suppose it's a different attitude that we normally don't hear in the country

sw2395B-ms98-a-0030 144.751250 149.310500 they um tend to spend
sw2395B-ms98-a-0031 149.310500 161.864125 quite a bit of time on one story they will have maybe two or three main stories and just spend a very large amount of time sort of like the uh what is that ABC's Nightline
sw2395B-ms98-a-0032 161.864125 175.592375 uh well i guess they only normally stick with just the one um story but they they can do a much better job since they don't have to chop it into little two minute stories

sw2395B-ms98-a-0034 179.852375 185.902250 no no it's very much national interest news a lot of times they end up um
sw2395B-ms98-a-0035 185.902250 200.183875 with these panels of experts and they go back and forth where everyone's giving some opinions and sometimes that i i don't know the value of that because um i saw plenty of jokes and and um 
sw2395B-ms98-a-0036 200.183875 208.907750 oh editorial cartoons about all the retired generals making their living [laughter-during] the the Gulf War

sw2395B-ms98-a-0045 252.588500 266.456000 it it it was very interesting that it seemed like some of the commentators had their axe to grind you know there were some that were screaming for air power there were some that were saying the air power wasn't going to do it and they seemed to mold the events
sw2395B-ms98-a-0046 266.456000 277.000750 to their view of the world which i suppose just about everyone does but these guys had a a uh national soap box to stand on and and express this view

sw2395B-ms98-a-0055 341.974500 352.172875 there there is a a big push you kn[ow]- with the local [vocalized-noise] T V stations to have little hot lines with um counselors 
sw2395B-ms98-a-0056 352.172875 361.288000 to to help parents uh learn how to talk about their war with their children i thought that was a really unusual thing

sw2395B-ms98-a-0063 393.602125 402.501375 i suppose that is a valuable service that again not having uh lived through another war i don't know if that's a common thing that people thought of or if that was
sw2395B-ms98-a-0064 402.501375 405.007500 a a new concern with people

sw2395B-ms98-a-0072 436.066750 447.214000 i will admit the same thing i would come home and flip on MacNeil Lehrer and they would run these extended two three hour versions of the program and i i was just i was
sw2395B-ms98-a-0073 447.214000 451.376000 horrified and [laughter-fascinated] by what i was seeing

sw2395B-ms98-a-0079 487.023125 490.338125 um i've got one question for you i
sw2395B-ms98-a-0080 490.338125 493.180750 you say you take the newspaper
sw2395B-ms98-a-0081 493.180750 494.278875 um
sw2395B-ms98-a-0082 494.278875 499.230875 i i found the newspaper situation in Dallas very interesting we've got
sw2395B-ms98-a-0083 499.230875 508.511250 the one fairly well relatively weaker paper the Times Herald and then the Morning News which has a very strong subscription
sw2395B-ms98-a-0084 508.511250 511.089125 does San Antonio ha[ve]- you said San Antonio right
sw2395B-ms98-a-0085 511.089125 514.422375 [vocalized-noise] do you have just one paper or do you have several

sw2395B-ms98-a-0098 560.366375 572.307750 Mourning News to be better but i i sort of have a liberal political slant and the Mourning News just has an incredibly conservative editorial um outlook 
sw2395B-ms98-a-0099 572.307750 576.998125 still i i get the Times Herald just to balance that out a little bit
