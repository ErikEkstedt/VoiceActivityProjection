sw2395A-ms98-a-0040 208.063750 211.036250 i've been getting a kick out of those lately
sw2395A-ms98-a-0041 211.036250 213.739500 although um
sw2395A-ms98-a-0042 213.739500 226.393625 i'm i'm only twenty five so i've never actually been through a period of war and i don't know anyone in the military and i don't have a lot of background knowledge in uh
sw2395A-ms98-a-0043 226.393625 235.985125 military strategy and and weaponry and and all that kind of stuff and i thought the generals were very interesting now when they started to speculate i
sw2395A-ms98-a-0044 235.985125 246.071500 i saw that for what it was and thought all of these guys don't know what's going on but i thought they were the[y]- they were interesting and and they shed some light on what was going on for me
sw2395A-ms98-a-0045 246.071500 248.018750 [silence]

sw2395A-ms98-a-0050 276.996375 289.064250 you know one of the the best uh television news shows that i saw during the war was a show on a Saturday morning on ABC and it was for children and it was hosted by Peter Jennings 
sw2395A-ms98-a-0051 289.064250 299.432750 and it was so interesting because they were relating the war to these children in their studio and they also had children calling in live from all over the country and asking questions
sw2395A-ms98-a-0052 299.432750 308.413250 and they they had all their correspondents in the different areas in Saudi Arabia and Israel and and all they had them all uh
sw2395A-ms98-a-0053 308.413250 321.189875 on i don't know what you'd call it other than on line they had them all on hold and if a child asked a question that the person in Jerusalem could best answer they would cut to that person and that person would answer the question it was just very
sw2395A-ms98-a-0054 321.189875 329.205500 informative and interesting [vocalized-noise] and uh i was real impressed at how ABC handled uh 
sw2395A-ms98-a-0055 329.205500 332.419000 translating the war for children
sw2395A-ms98-a-0056 332.419000 351.830000 [silence]

sw2395A-ms98-a-0059 360.000000 366.511250 and our local HEB stores here i don't know if it's HEB statewide or whatever but they have videos
sw2395A-ms98-a-0060 366.511250 373.776125 that uh i don't know if they still have them but they were free rental videos that had something to do with the war
sw2395A-ms98-a-0061 373.776125 376.498625 [silence]
sw2395A-ms98-a-0062 376.498625 378.393875 uh it was it was
sw2395A-ms98-a-0063 378.393875 381.293750 right it was something for children
sw2395A-ms98-a-0064 381.293750 393.990125 that that they they had several advertisements on television pushing parents going and and uh getting the video and watching it with their children and discussing it and that kind of thing
sw2395A-ms98-a-0065 393.990125 402.383500 [silence]
sw2395A-ms98-a-0066 402.383500 403.984375 well
sw2395A-ms98-a-0067 403.984375 411.257250 back during the Vietnam conflict that no one will will have the guts enough to call a real war uh
sw2395A-ms98-a-0068 411.257250 416.778250 the that type of technology just wasn't at people's disposal
sw2395A-ms98-a-0069 416.778250 422.005500 so i don't think there's ever been a war that's been so thoroughly
sw2395A-ms98-a-0070 422.005500 424.342375 covered by the news
sw2395A-ms98-a-0071 424.342375 430.198750 [silence]
sw2395A-ms98-a-0072 430.198750 437.111875 yeah i tell you what the first three days i was glued to the television

sw2395A-ms98-a-0078 455.378125 465.847500 um and Friday night i was i stayed up until two o'clock in the morning sitting right dead center in front of my television just watching practically with my mouth hanging open
sw2395A-ms98-a-0079 465.847500 479.012250 because i was watching CNN and they would they would switch back to the one of their Israel bureaus and the people would be standing there in gas masks and you'd be hearing the sirens and it was just i was amazed 
sw2395A-ms98-a-0080 479.012250 482.350000 [silence]

sw2395A-ms98-a-0092 517.344625 527.441000 uh the one that i picked is more similar in format to the newspaper i grew up near Houston and there are two major newspapers there that run pretty much neck and neck
sw2395A-ms98-a-0093 527.441000 537.804625 and the one i picked here had the same format as the one that my parents took as i was growing up i mean the same type of typeface on the headline and that kind of stuff i mean it['s]- it's
sw2395A-ms98-a-0094 537.804625 551.085125 {piddley} stuff to pick a newspaper over and i enjoy the comics are better in this newspaper like this newspaper has The Far Side and some other comics that i enjoy and the other one has some weird ones that i've never heard of so

sw2395A-ms98-a-0103 587.079375 593.354125 but he's a football coach at Southwest Texas State University so he's getting all the sports sections
sw2395A-ms98-a-0104 593.354125 598.934875 and so you know he has these stacks of Sunday newspapers that go unread unless
