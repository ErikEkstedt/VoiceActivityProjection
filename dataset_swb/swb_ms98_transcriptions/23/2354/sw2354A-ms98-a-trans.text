sw2354A-ms98-a-0075 361.495125 364.982875 i know there's not any food that you can get
sw2354A-ms98-a-0076 364.982875 375.469500 and it's grown on good soil hardly anymore and i know my [vocalized-noise] my husband's uncle owns a bi[g]- um some acreage in a Eastland Texas which is in West Texas
sw2354A-ms98-a-0077 375.469500 382.471000 and he owns a lot of acreage that's been farmed properly you know and uh we get black eyed peas off of it and stuff but
sw2354A-ms98-a-0078 382.471000 390.342375 i know that you know the further we go from Adam the worse the food is for you but God still somehow makes us all
sw2354A-ms98-a-0079 390.342375 399.958250 be able to still live i think it's a miracle we're all still alive after so many generations well the last couple of processed foods you know i mean but
sw2354A-ms98-a-0080 399.958250 414.149250 i don't know i like to i like to my i like to be able to eat really healthy you know what am saying and i guess i'm going to have to wait for the millennium i think though because i do don't think we're going to restore the earth to you know i think Jesus is the only one that can make this earth be restored to what it should be
sw2354A-ms98-a-0081 414.149250 423.980500 but uh in the meantime we pray over our food because i'm always looking down my plate and i think man isn't this stuff was probably grown in who knows what you know kind of environment but
sw2354A-ms98-a-0082 423.980500 428.759500 i do take some vitamins on the side and i do like reading books like that i just
sw2354A-ms98-a-0083 428.759500 436.290500 i have a hard time a lot of the books are real new age oriented like Mother Earth and we're going to restore the earth i just don't see that i think
sw2354A-ms98-a-0084 436.290500 450.223000 i mean think to think that is almost it's hopeless to think that man can do anything with the you know what i'm saying it's to big than us and i think God's in charge and God's going to restore it when he wants to so sometimes i get bogged down in the
sw2354A-ms98-a-0085 450.223000 464.250250 you know in the ideology that motivates a lot of health food and motivates a lot of vitamin taking but you know there's a balance in it sometimes i read stuff like that and then i just chunk off like water off your back some of it and
sw2354A-ms98-a-0086 464.250250 471.995000 you know and try and do what's what i can do out of it that's practical but anyway so

sw2354A-ms98-a-0106 540.472500 554.305500 really you know i bet that's why we have some friends that eat only i just took this Amish bread out of the oven man it's going to be good i had a starter that friend of mine made anyway uh i had a friend that read a book on that
sw2354A-ms98-a-0107 554.305500 562.727250 and um i've all my relatives my m[om]- you know you probably read Back To Eden or something i don't know [vocalized-noise] we read a lot i know people have read all those books but
sw2354A-ms98-a-0108 562.727250 570.209375 the um they dr[illed]- they drilled a well i don't know how many feet but it was three or four times deeper than it needed to be
sw2354A-ms98-a-0109 570.209375 581.477500 and so their water comes out they live in Grand Prairie but it's they live kind of in a the planes go right over from DFW so it's not real developed and so they have a [vocalized-noise] probably half an acre
sw2354A-ms98-a-0110 581.477500 591.476875 and yeah and they drilled this well and the water comes out at thirty two degrees so [laughter] it's kinds of neat would that be healthier do to do that to drill your own fresh water well like that
