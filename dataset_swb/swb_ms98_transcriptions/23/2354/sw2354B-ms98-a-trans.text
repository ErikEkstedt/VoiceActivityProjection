sw2354B-ms98-a-0046 299.468125 310.742375 and uh i was pretty impressed he had a he before he started out on his experiments he had a battery of tests done on his body to determine the age of each one of his organs
sw2354B-ms98-a-0047 310.742375 318.752750 you know based on how well it was performing and then he embarked on this uh vitamin treatment and then every year he had the same tests run
sw2354B-ms98-a-0048 318.752750 327.552000 and at the age of thirty two i think it was his um heart was that of a fourteen year old
sw2354B-ms98-a-0049 327.552000 335.170250 and all the rest of his organs were all greatly you know all tested out greatly below his actual age

sw2354B-ms98-a-0051 346.223000 353.805375 and uh it was all from taking the right vitamins and things that that give you the strength and of course doing isometric exercises

sw2354B-ms98-a-0063 480.257375 492.764875 um for food that doesn't apply to water they don't consider water a food and uh the basics premise is that if water was a food it would be you know they wouldn't be able to sell it to you
sw2354B-ms98-a-0064 492.764875 504.027500 through your pipes because it's toxic um chlorine it's toxic it's a i don't know if your on city water city water has chlorine in it chlorine causes cancer
sw2354B-ms98-a-0065 504.027500 506.425625 they know that they've proven that
sw2354B-ms98-a-0066 506.425625 515.700250 um yet their saying well we're putting such low doses in there that well you don't have to worry about dying from it the problem is that i've i've read books that
sw2354B-ms98-a-0067 515.700250 522.816250 uh have proven that there is a link between the {ingestation} of chlorine and arteriosclerosis which is heart attack
sw2354B-ms98-a-0068 522.816250 528.303625 and if you look at the history of heart attacks heart attacks were nonexistent prior to nineteen twenty 
sw2354B-ms98-a-0069 528.303625 541.364375 and we started doing um large quantities of chlorination of water starting around uh where we experimented with it in nineteen oh three and nineteen thirteen most of the major cities had chlorinated water
