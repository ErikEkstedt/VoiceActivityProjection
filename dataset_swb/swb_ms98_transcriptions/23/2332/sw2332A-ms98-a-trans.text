sw2332A-ms98-a-0022 107.171125 113.490500 what we were doing why we were doing it so i- i guess i had a little uh uh first hand knowledge of
sw2332A-ms98-a-0023 113.490500 122.230375 of uh seeing the films i had more of extensive training in in uh background information of the reasons why they were doing it the cost that uh
sw2332A-ms98-a-0024 122.230375 129.909000 uh that we projected that it that it actually cost companies by having people uh uh be involved with drugs

sw2332A-ms98-a-0058 295.894125 298.568125 the the smoking premium
sw2332A-ms98-a-0059 298.568125 302.111125 out in Texas i understand they they started doing that
sw2332A-ms98-a-0060 302.111125 305.684625 [silence]
sw2332A-ms98-a-0061 305.684625 307.179125 June July
sw2332A-ms98-a-0062 307.179125 312.786125 yeah that they from what i understand that uh notices went out to all of the sites

sw2332A-ms98-a-0064 314.749000 316.278500 yeah
sw2332A-ms98-a-0065 316.278500 321.964250 well that's that's the problem that's you don't uh how about_1 uh do you ea[t]- do you like French fries 
sw2332A-ms98-a-0066 321.964250 324.057875 [silence]

sw2332A-ms98-a-0068 330.855125 337.112750 uh then you would get upset it's it's uh what they're doing is they're nibbling at the population piece by piece
sw2332A-ms98-a-0069 337.112750 347.193625 and uh and now they know that the number or percentage of smokers is is less than the the uh the people who do not smoke then they can go ahead and do that um
sw2332A-ms98-a-0070 347.193625 357.720500 [silence]
sw2332A-ms98-a-0071 357.720500 360.736875 preventable death not yeah but

sw2332A-ms98-a-0073 365.677250 370.797875 yeah but isn't isn't the uh the insurance also for for uh Blue Cross
sw2332A-ms98-a-0074 370.797875 375.384375 so they're not only saying pre[ventable]- not preventable death they're also saying um
sw2332A-ms98-a-0075 375.384375 380.553625 that you'll have uh less likelihood of being sick if you don't smoke

sw2332A-ms98-a-0095 432.382625 435.838250 wh[at]- what do you mean if they can prove it there there's already
sw2332A-ms98-a-0096 435.838250 441.166875 hardening of the arteries it's it's uh sure it is [laughter] high cholesterol
sw2332A-ms98-a-0097 441.166875 444.278875 [laughter]
sw2332A-ms98-a-0098 444.278875 455.507500 s[ee]- see one of the things that will determine whether they're able to do that or not is not their ability to prove that it is unhealthy because we all know that French fries are not healthy for you it's the ca[pability]- it's the capability of detecting it
sw2332A-ms98-a-0099 455.507500 458.795125 how do you prove someone has eaten French fries [laughter]
sw2332A-ms98-a-0100 458.795125 460.808750 [laughter]
sw2332A-ms98-a-0101 460.808750 462.715250 [silence]
sw2332A-ms98-a-0102 462.715250 471.362375 um but i think in time come you're going to see that happening you're going to see um where the high risk people pay a premium but they have to find a way to prove it
sw2332A-ms98-a-0103 471.362375 473.667750 [silence]
sw2332A-ms98-a-0104 473.667750 474.695375 yeah yeah

sw2332A-ms98-a-0108 487.829375 491.757125 but yeah but there are more drinkers than smokers if you think about it 
sw2332A-ms98-a-0109 491.757125 504.151500 and and drinking is still socially acceptable where smoking is socially unacceptable today and so that there's a big difference so that so that they really can't make a a change in in policy about drinking until
sw2332A-ms98-a-0110 504.151500 507.923125 [silence]
sw2332A-ms98-a-0111 507.923125 511.996250 [laughter] ye[ah]- yeah right right yeah 
sw2332A-ms98-a-0112 511.996250 525.654250 so i guess you can you can classify alcohol as a drug so is a cigarette in my opinion um where it's not so[mething]- i don't think people that are that are smoking are doing it voluntarily i think they're doing it involuntarily
sw2332A-ms98-a-0113 525.654250 533.474625 i know i am um i don't know anybody in their right mind that says that that i'm doing it because i want to i
sw2332A-ms98-a-0114 533.474625 545.188125 well i- i- i do i do make that statement i say i do it because_1 i like it but i can't say i'm i'm i'm doing it because_1 i want to i'm doing it because_1 i have to uh or be[cause]- my desire is greater than uh
