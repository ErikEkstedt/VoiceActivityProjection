sw2332B-ms98-a-0013 40.564750 43.840750 yes that's [noise] the the major issue i guess that uh 
sw2332B-ms98-a-0014 43.840750 58.473500 [silence]
sw2332B-ms98-a-0015 58.473500 62.781125 i have a a similar opinion at first i
sw2332B-ms98-a-0016 62.781125 65.081875 wasn't sure
sw2332B-ms98-a-0017 65.081875 67.088250 but
sw2332B-ms98-a-0018 67.088250 69.250125 then
sw2332B-ms98-a-0019 69.250125 73.723625 i thought it was a good thing for the company as as well
sw2332B-ms98-a-0020 73.723625 80.120125 uh uh we had a couple of people in our group who [vocalized-noise] wro[te]- one who wrote a huge letter to the editors 
sw2332B-ms98-a-0021 80.120125 85.053625 saying that it's a violation of my rights and this and that and the tests aren't accurate and
sw2332B-ms98-a-0022 85.053625 91.484000 but i think they've got that testing down to a real science where you know they don't re[ally]- you know
sw2332B-ms98-a-0023 91.484000 98.358625 i'm i'm sure you saw the video on how they do the testing and it it's almost impossible i think to uh
sw2332B-ms98-a-0024 98.358625 100.074500 to make a mistake

sw2332B-ms98-a-0032 133.132125 134.440750 and

sw2332B-ms98-a-0034 143.331000 146.004375 oh oh taking drug testing
sw2332B-ms98-a-0035 146.004375 148.319500 oh sure i think that's that's
sw2332B-ms98-a-0036 148.319500 155.111500 i feel that you know for certain cases that i that i am willing to give up my rights
sw2332B-ms98-a-0037 155.111500 159.291625 to secure the rights of others i guess is what i'm saying
sw2332B-ms98-a-0038 159.291625 163.394500 uh when the public whole ah is at stake 
sw2332B-ms98-a-0039 163.394500 169.218375 then i'm willing to gi[ve]- you know personally i can't speak for others but for myself i'm willing to say okay you know
sw2332B-ms98-a-0040 169.218375 174.501375 if i see this is a right to if to privacy i'm willing to give up that right
sw2332B-ms98-a-0041 174.501375 177.669125 because i can see that it's uh
sw2332B-ms98-a-0042 177.669125 181.665125 public good is at stake and the company good is at stake and
sw2332B-ms98-a-0043 181.665125 186.588000 you know if they can get this thing under control you know it it's going to save us all money
sw2332B-ms98-a-0044 186.588000 193.190625 as far as benefits and everything else you know insurance and and and and everything else in this country

sw2332B-ms98-a-0048 210.303625 216.731625 right you don't work in an area where there's chemicals or machinery or or things like that but
sw2332B-ms98-a-0049 216.731625 220.623750 and um they don't have any of that up here but you know um
sw2332B-ms98-a-0050 220.623750 223.446500 i guess it's just the productivity
sw2332B-ms98-a-0051 223.446500 228.308750 and the the number of uh uh sick days i guess
sw2332B-ms98-a-0052 228.308750 230.347375 and that they uh
sw2332B-ms98-a-0053 230.347375 231.899625 that they accrue
sw2332B-ms98-a-0054 231.899625 233.613000 [silence]
sw2332B-ms98-a-0055 233.613000 239.007000 right well well i- i think they would you know someone on drugs probably misses more work
sw2332B-ms98-a-0056 239.007000 243.277875 and then i guess that's why this smoking thing came out too

sw2332B-ms98-a-0060 258.244250 264.885625 when they're dri[ve]- and that's why why i guess the car insurance has no nonsmoker rates or whatever as well
sw2332B-ms98-a-0061 264.885625 266.154625 yeah
sw2332B-ms98-a-0062 266.154625 267.498000 [silence]
sw2332B-ms98-a-0063 267.498000 268.865750 oh yeah
sw2332B-ms98-a-0064 268.865750 269.706625 they
sw2332B-ms98-a-0065 269.706625 271.084375 non[smoker]-
sw2332B-ms98-a-0066 271.084375 273.527875 at least down here in Texas they have non[smoker]-
sw2332B-ms98-a-0067 273.527875 276.682125 nonsmoker they call them_1 discounts
sw2332B-ms98-a-0068 276.682125 281.297625 they give you if you're a nonsmoker i- i guess there is some kind of studies that show
sw2332B-ms98-a-0069 281.297625 283.520250 but if you're smoking
sw2332B-ms98-a-0070 283.520250 290.969125 you're not you're not as you know [vocalized-noise] when you're lighting up or something you know your hands both hands aren't on the wheel or whatever

sw2332B-ms98-a-0072 301.565625 304.641000 that's yeah i guess that takes effect in uh

sw2332B-ms98-a-0074 305.814625 308.340000 when June July yeah

sw2332B-ms98-a-0076 312.319125 317.327375 right there was a lot of uh controversy about that too i'm not a i'm not a smoker myself
sw2332B-ms98-a-0077 317.327375 322.802375 [silence]
sw2332B-ms98-a-0078 322.802375 324.602500 i do [laughter]

sw2332B-ms98-a-0080 329.900750 332.125125 yeah i'd probably get upset
sw2332B-ms98-a-0081 332.125125 334.229000 yeah yeah

sw2332B-ms98-a-0089 345.991375 348.886500 right if they i- i- i assume if they they
sw2332B-ms98-a-0090 348.886500 354.239375 i guess they're saying with the cigarettes though that they've been able to show that it's the number one
sw2332B-ms98-a-0091 354.239375 356.995500 leading cause of preventable
sw2332B-ms98-a-0092 356.995500 358.604125 preventable
sw2332B-ms98-a-0093 358.604125 365.681625 death in this country was a half a million people a year or so dying with smoke relating smoking related

sw2332B-ms98-a-0095 378.802125 389.745500 right right right [vocalized-noise] right well that's all what i always felt if it if those studies were true about smokers having higher medical costs
sw2332B-ms98-a-0096 389.745500 392.903500 and we do have one smoker in our area who and he
sw2332B-ms98-a-0097 392.903500 395.776625 he seems to miss a lot of [laughter-work] 
sw2332B-ms98-a-0098 395.776625 397.576000 but um
sw2332B-ms98-a-0099 397.576000 399.835875 um forty
sw2332B-ms98-a-0100 399.835875 401.887125 eight maybe
sw2332B-ms98-a-0101 401.887125 404.411000 yeah forty five forty eight
sw2332B-ms98-a-0102 404.411000 406.192125 [silence]
sw2332B-ms98-a-0103 406.192125 414.303000 yeah but then there's people you talk to and say i've never been sick a day in my life you know so i guess i guess you know the the studies show as an average
sw2332B-ms98-a-0104 414.303000 417.769625 not specific cases and uh
sw2332B-ms98-a-0105 417.769625 421.644500 i thought well with you know if that's really true then
sw2332B-ms98-a-0106 421.644500 425.241750 then i guess i agreed with the extra premium
sw2332B-ms98-a-0107 425.241750 429.213875 if it cou[ld]- i mean if they can come along and prove that French fries
sw2332B-ms98-a-0108 429.213875 433.668375 were the same deal then they have a right to charge for that too i guess
sw2332B-ms98-a-0109 433.668375 437.596500 yeah that that it's a major cause of uh early
sw2332B-ms98-a-0110 437.596500 438.651750 right
sw2332B-ms98-a-0111 438.651750 441.386375 [silence]
sw2332B-ms98-a-0112 441.386375 443.144125 well it depends if they're cooked in

sw2332B-ms98-a-0119 456.518000 459.849000 right it it's the it's the honor system isn't it
sw2332B-ms98-a-0120 459.849000 464.445750 it's the honor system i know it'll be an interesting experiment to see how
sw2332B-ms98-a-0121 464.445750 465.520375 yeah

sw2332B-ms98-a-0124 470.658125 473.639250 right well well i think the same way with alcohol too
sw2332B-ms98-a-0125 473.639250 477.207000 personally it you know that that would probably be the next
sw2332B-ms98-a-0126 477.207000 478.775125 the next thing
sw2332B-ms98-a-0127 478.775125 480.094500 i mean
sw2332B-ms98-a-0128 480.094500 484.168375 but you know the[re's]- there's the difference because_1 uh they say you know
sw2332B-ms98-a-0129 484.168375 488.576375 i guess they say tobacco is addictive i guess they say alcohol is addictive as well

sw2332B-ms98-a-0131 490.021500 491.092000 oh yeah that's

sw2332B-ms98-a-0138 503.184250 506.025375 yeah well it's part of the business world too when you make

sw2332B-ms98-a-0155 553.204250 560.384500 and i think the longest they've made it is about three months and then they go to a a friend's house or something and there they're all smoking and
sw2332B-ms98-a-0156 560.384500 570.228750 and they break yeah they just can't stand it you know all of a sudden they get it's overwhelming and then they break down and then they say i'm a failure and then they just give up you know
