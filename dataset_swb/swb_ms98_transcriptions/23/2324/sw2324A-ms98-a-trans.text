sw2324A-ms98-a-0015 51.952750 66.299625 yeah i a[gree]- i agree with you i don't think we should either even though i know there are benefits to the metric system i don't think the benefits of the metric system outweigh the the disadvantages that would happen to the people of America
sw2324A-ms98-a-0016 66.299625 76.350375 and also the um [noise] i don't know it seems almost like there's this it's a peer pressure thing is why we keep wanting to do it is so we'll look good to the other nations
sw2324A-ms98-a-0017 76.350375 88.752000 because i think they that's an area that the other nations especially Europe look down on us like oh we're just backward wayward children who still use this backward system who haven't really attained it yet
sw2324A-ms98-a-0018 88.752000 98.274500 and i feel it's just pride of why they keep trying to push it on us and it's like hey we're content with this no it's probably not as accurate probably
sw2324A-ms98-a-0019 98.274500 112.296875 you know intellectually doesn't it's not as sound intellectually but like you said i mean come on [laughter] i had six years of college and i don't know the metric system and i don't care to learn it and i'm not some kind of an idiot i just

sw2324A-ms98-a-0026 138.529000 143.313500 there's a lot of people like you're educated i'm educated my husband is
sw2324A-ms98-a-0027 143.313500 146.555125 but i mean a lot of people are flat not educated
sw2324A-ms98-a-0028 146.555125 160.910875 and if i have a hard time you know putting that into my life can we put that off on the other eighty percent of the population that doesn't have any college or i don't know how much of the you know but a large percentage probably over half of the rest of the population
sw2324A-ms98-a-0029 160.910875 169.803125 they don't have any college probably much at all and if we can't take it and use it easily well we how can you put that on like elderly people and
sw2324A-ms98-a-0030 169.803125 177.002250 you know just people that maybe just aren't blessed with as as much sharpness and men[tal]- mental acuity

sw2324A-ms98-a-0041 199.125500 208.956250 yeah i think it failed too because like what you said of just you know hey this is ridiculous i think Americans have so much stress on them_1 right now
sw2324A-ms98-a-0042 208.956250 222.892875 i mean if you look at the average family it's like man they barely have time to stop and get gas much less to try and figure out how much gas they're really getting and do all this and it's like [noise] i mean come on let's take the pressure off
sw2324A-ms98-a-0043 222.892875 224.005125 [silence]
sw2324A-ms98-a-0044 224.005125 235.666500 yeah and it's just like another thing the American family doesn't need any more pressure just leave them_1 alone let them_1 measure their green bean water in cups and leave them_1 [laughter-alone]
sw2324A-ms98-a-0045 235.666500 237.276250 i don't know
