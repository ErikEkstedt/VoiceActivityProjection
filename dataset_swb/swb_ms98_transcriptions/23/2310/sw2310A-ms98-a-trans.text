sw2310A-ms98-a-0013 22.344500 33.009250 well we've got we've got a cat and this is a very very special cat because uh we lived in the Philippines for thirty months we worked for TI in in Biejo City
sw2310A-ms98-a-0014 33.009250 38.635000 in the Philippines and uh as you know uh the Filipinos are quite poor
sw2310A-ms98-a-0015 38.635000 43.239375 and and uh they don't uh generally they eat their pets
sw2310A-ms98-a-0016 43.239375 55.624500 uh well not generally but dogs they do uh so having a pet uh is is a luxury most of them don't have and we uh were able to find one that was born in a store
sw2310A-ms98-a-0017 55.624500 64.134000 and the uh a Filipino lady that ran the store was giving them away and we took him home with us when he was uh about three weeks old
sw2310A-ms98-a-0018 64.134000 71.105375 and uh ultimately my family moved back to Dallas and i had to stay on in the Philippines ten months after they went back
sw2310A-ms98-a-0019 71.105375 79.967875 and uh eventually i shipped him home by air and you know you have to really love a pet to spend two hundred and forty dollars to ship him across the ocean
sw2310A-ms98-a-0020 79.967875 86.413125 [silence]
sw2310A-ms98-a-0021 86.413125 96.102250 yeah there was no problem because there was a veterinarian in our neighborhood and we had all the proper paperwork and and i shipped him uh uh by air
sw2310A-ms98-a-0022 96.102250 103.795250 and uh let my family know when he was going to be in and they went out to the freight claiming area out at uh DFW airport and claimed him
sw2310A-ms98-a-0023 103.795250 108.726125 it was it was it was it was pretty interesting uh did you have any pets when you were growing up

sw2310A-ms98-a-0044 188.934625 195.792375 and it's amazing how they how they adapt to the outside i was raised in New England and we had an Eskimo Spitz
sw2310A-ms98-a-0045 195.792375 206.345125 and he was never in the house a day in his life and i can you know i remember like this sounds like old grandfather stories but i can remember thirty five below zero and thirty inches of snow on the ground

sw2310A-ms98-a-0060 257.942250 265.628750 oh for goodness sakes yeah uh the only dog we ever had uh we lived prior to living in the Philippines with TI we lived in Malaysia
sw2310A-ms98-a-0061 265.628750 273.268750 and we were told when we got there that it'd be good to get a dog because uh there were a lot of uh breaking and entering and robberies
sw2310A-ms98-a-0062 273.268750 283.277250 and the uh native Malays by religion are scared of dogs in fact the lick of a dog is supposed to be something very very bad something very evil
sw2310A-ms98-a-0063 283.277250 292.577500 so what happened uh was anybody that had a dog at least the native Malays made up fifty percent of the population if you had a dog uh you wouldn't get ripped off by a Malay
sw2310A-ms98-a-0064 292.577500 302.360250 now the other fifty percent was pa[rt]- some Chinese some Indians and they might then they didn't have any qu[alms]- any qualms about dogs so we went down to the local SPCA
sw2310A-ms98-a-0065 302.360250 315.164000 uh the American association in in Gautolompora uh actually had uh uh an SPCA there and we went down and picked us up a little old female mongrel and uh and brought her home and she made an excellent pet
sw2310A-ms98-a-0066 315.164000 324.573125 uh except the only problem is we played badminton in the yard a lot and we used to have to get the little shovel and scoop and go clean the yard at night before we went and play [laughter-badminton]
sw2310A-ms98-a-0067 324.573125 331.607875 but i'm i'm a runner by by hobby and she used to love to get outside the gate and i'd put her leash on and take her running with me
sw2310A-ms98-a-0068 331.607875 339.310625 and it was only years later i read that you shouldn't do it particularly in the tropical climates where we were and when she came back she'd drink about three panfuls of water [laughter]
sw2310A-ms98-a-0069 339.310625 349.604750 but an[yway]- it wasn't it wasn't in the heat of the day i'd always go running about seven o'clock in the evening or something like that but boy she was ready i'd get that leash and she'd come over and start jumping all over me to get ready to go
sw2310A-ms98-a-0070 349.604750 351.202000 and and
sw2310A-ms98-a-0071 351.202000 371.693250 [silence]

sw2310A-ms98-a-0087 462.431125 466.243250 [silence]
sw2310A-ms98-a-0088 466.243250 478.840375 well we we we live in a in a in a residential neighborhood and the animals pretty well run a lot of people have fences in their backyards and and dogs are kept inside fences uh cat cats are pretty well on the run
sw2310A-ms98-a-0089 478.840375 492.707375 fortunately people are responsible and they've all been spayed or neutered so we don't have gigantic litters of kittens running around here but they uh it's interesting the lady across from us has always taken in strays and she's got six or seven cats
sw2310A-ms98-a-0090 492.707375 497.407875 and one of her cats somehow or other must have get into our house accidentally
sw2310A-ms98-a-0091 497.407875 509.959125 uh when the door was open and found where our cat's food dish is and he likes our food a lot better than he likes hers and when i pull my car up in the evening i can hear him she leaves her garage door open most of them_1 sleep in the garage at night
sw2310A-ms98-a-0092 509.959125 523.510500 and no matter what time of night it is he hears my car stop and he's over here and he's forcing his head in the door when i open the door and i go in he goes in he gets a great big mouthful of food because_1 he knows i'm going to pick him up right off and put him back out again and some days
sw2310A-ms98-a-0093 523.510500 535.482375 he'll follow me up the front walk so i'll run around the back of the house and try to go in the back door and he'll he'll go around and beat me there so i've got so that now i fake him i make a move toward the back so he runs around the back then i go in the front door
sw2310A-ms98-a-0094 535.482375 539.061125 so i- i can i can get in without him but he's he's he's fat as a
sw2310A-ms98-a-0095 539.061125 540.085375 [silence]
sw2310A-ms98-a-0096 540.085375 542.182750 yeah he's he's he's
sw2310A-ms98-a-0097 542.182750 555.370750 he's fat as a little pig and she took him to the vet and the vet said you got to stop feeding him so much or he's going to die of a heart attack and so she said to me you've got to stop feeding and i said i don't do it intentionally i and if i'm in the house
sw2310A-ms98-a-0098 555.370750 565.781000 already sometimes i can keep him out if i'm trying to come in the house and he's trying to come in too i just kind of put my foot out uh against his neck while i'm i'm trying to uh get in the door and that works
sw2310A-ms98-a-0099 565.781000 575.323875 but other times i'll forget that he's out there at the door and as soon as i open it to go out he's by me like a shot and by the time i can get him he's got a great big gigantic mouthful of food
sw2310A-ms98-a-0100 575.323875 578.447625 [silence]
sw2310A-ms98-a-0101 578.447625 585.787250 no i- i think i- i- i think he he likes our food best uh somehow or another our cat has become a housecat
sw2310A-ms98-a-0102 585.787250 594.383375 and he uh he sleeps with us he sleeps with my wife and i and either he sleeps across the foot of the bed on top of either my feet or her feet or above the covers
sw2310A-ms98-a-0103 594.383375 599.726125 and uh except when it's extremely cold and we don't get many days like that here in Texas
