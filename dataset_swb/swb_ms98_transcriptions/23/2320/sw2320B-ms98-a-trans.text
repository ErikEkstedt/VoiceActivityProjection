sw2320B-ms98-a-0052 177.421250 179.400375 i've got one of them

sw2320B-ms98-a-0056 197.495375 203.932000 [noise] well uh my mother-in-law gave us one for Christmas a couple years ago i don't think it's five inches i think it's a little bit bigger than that
sw2320B-ms98-a-0057 203.932000 210.257875 but it runs on uh car batteries and you know stick it in the lighter and runs on regular batteries and electricity
sw2320B-ms98-a-0058 210.257875 212.552500 so it's a neat little thing to have
sw2320B-ms98-a-0059 212.552500 220.187125 [silence]
sw2320B-ms98-a-0060 220.187125 223.996875 uh well they ha[ve]- we have direct deposit that helps a lot
sw2320B-ms98-a-0061 223.996875 226.384375 uh and uh
sw2320B-ms98-a-0062 226.384375 233.490500 first thing he does is we get out our clipboard we got everything on a clipboard from now for three months ahead
sw2320B-ms98-a-0063 233.490500 236.833000 and uh you know he makes the same amount every week
sw2320B-ms98-a-0064 236.833000 245.228875 uh he's not it's not salary he gets paid by the hour but we know exactly to the penny how much he's going to get unless he works over and then it's
sw2320B-ms98-a-0065 245.228875 249.605750 uh you know that's extra uh but
sw2320B-ms98-a-0066 249.605750 259.812000 he's got us situated to where we pay uh pay two or three of the big ones at the beginning of the month and then all the little ones at the middle of the month
sw2320B-ms98-a-0067 259.812000 269.098875 and uh none of them's ever been late you know the ones that come in the middle of the month are early you know we pay them like two weeks ahead of time and uh
sw2320B-ms98-a-0068 269.098875 271.522875 it works out real well uh
sw2320B-ms98-a-0069 271.522875 274.410000 most problem we had was when uh
sw2320B-ms98-a-0070 274.410000 276.184500 let's see when was it
sw2320B-ms98-a-0071 276.184500 279.328625 something like we had a three p[ay]- uh weekends
sw2320B-ms98-a-0072 279.328625 284.413375 uh you know it was a late uh uh the long pay period
sw2320B-ms98-a-0073 284.413375 288.025375 and uh we was close to being uh
sw2320B-ms98-a-0074 288.025375 294.488000 oh shoot i'm trying to think it's been so long uh it was when he was in the military and uh
sw2320B-ms98-a-0075 294.488000 300.022750 it was something like four weeks in between pay periods and it really blew everything away
sw2320B-ms98-a-0076 300.022750 303.548750 uh we was close to being late on a lot of stuff
sw2320B-ms98-a-0077 303.548750 306.356750 and so that was pretty bad but
sw2320B-ms98-a-0078 306.356750 310.568000 i don't know i like that he's got it mapped out in the uh on the clipboard
sw2320B-ms98-a-0079 310.568000 313.812625 [silence]
sw2320B-ms98-a-0080 313.812625 314.549875 yeah

sw2320B-ms98-a-0084 318.858125 323.633250 with the direct deposit that's what helps you know because he doesn't have the money in hand
sw2320B-ms98-a-0085 323.633250 331.448375 [silence]
sw2320B-ms98-a-0086 331.448375 336.546125 oh well he's he's we got that ATM machine and that and his bank is right there at his work
sw2320B-ms98-a-0087 336.546125 341.524000 and that's hard you know uh i'm sure you're [vocalized-noise] familiar with TI up here
sw2320B-ms98-a-0088 341.524000 344.866250 and you know how they got the Tex[ans]- uh that Texans Credit Union
sw2320B-ms98-a-0089 344.866250 346.730375 right there he uh
sw2320B-ms98-a-0090 346.730375 355.406875 he's good at uh getting into that but he's g[ood]- he's you know we never in my i- i've been married to him for seven years and we've never had a check bounce
sw2320B-ms98-a-0091 355.406875 356.417250 [silence]
