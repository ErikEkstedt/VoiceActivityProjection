sw2349B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 2.093375 okay
sw2349B-ms98-a-0002 2.093375 3.731750 um
sw2349B-ms98-a-0003 3.731750 12.146250 i i understand that it's being proposed as a requirement for uh young people to be
sw2349B-ms98-a-0004 12.146250 15.222750 to go into public service i think
sw2349B-ms98-a-0005 15.222750 17.864125 [silence]
sw2349B-ms98-a-0006 17.864125 29.017500 yeah yeah i think that it probably would be a a good program i think probably two years is too long i think maybe a year would be the the longest tha[t]-
sw2349B-ms98-a-0007 29.017500 39.472375 yeah and you there will be a lot of rebellion in that and when you get people who have no desire to be there in the first place i don't think that they're gonna be serving anybody
sw2349B-ms98-a-0008 39.472375 47.666375 yeah so i think it would be a good thing though to encourage other people who aren't even aware that they can do such a thing
sw2349B-ms98-a-0009 47.666375 50.094750 to get out there and do so
sw2349B-ms98-a-0010 50.094750 51.966625 [silence]
sw2349B-ms98-a-0011 51.966625 53.379375 yeah
sw2349B-ms98-a-0012 53.379375 55.518750 [silence]
sw2349B-ms98-a-0013 55.518750 59.494625 right right college credit is a good idea because
sw2349B-ms98-a-0014 59.494625 63.553375 [silence]
sw2349B-ms98-a-0015 63.553375 65.053250 right
sw2349B-ms98-a-0016 65.053250 66.074500 [silence]
sw2349B-ms98-a-0017 66.074500 72.708000 that's [laughter-right] yeah they probably couldn't do anything monetary but i think giv[ing]- giving some kind of college credit
sw2349B-ms98-a-0018 72.708000 75.679125 [silence]
sw2349B-ms98-a-0019 75.679125 77.050750 uh-huh
sw2349B-ms98-a-0020 77.050750 78.267375 [silence]
sw2349B-ms98-a-0021 78.267375 86.255250 no i don't think so either because_1 a lot of people um [vocalized-noise] depending on how the public service programs are set up and i'm not -[th]at that familiar with them to know
sw2349B-ms98-a-0022 86.255250 98.233375 but you know if [vocalized-noise] a lot of people flat can't afford to you know that and most kids these days have gotten themselves into um financial situations where they have to be working all the time
sw2349B-ms98-a-0023 98.233375 101.127000 so it's it's a really tough question
sw2349B-ms98-a-0024 101.127000 102.865375 that's right
sw2349B-ms98-a-0025 102.865375 104.323000 [silence]
sw2349B-ms98-a-0026 104.323000 115.515500 yeah and if you put them in public service right out of high school then that's that postpones their college for a year and that would upset a lot of people too because_1 they just wanna get on
sw2349B-ms98-a-0027 115.515500 118.292250 [silence]
sw2349B-ms98-a-0028 118.292250 131.135000 yeah i you know i think it it would be good for a lot of people to get involved in that kind of program but i i- i think it can't be something that's mandatory it has to be something that's voluntary you know which is a pretty much the way it is now they might
sw2349B-ms98-a-0029 131.135000 133.266875 [silence]
sw2349B-ms98-a-0030 133.266875 142.997500 yeah and -[th]at's the other thing is that [vocalized-noise] you know instead of making it mandatory they may[be]- maybe need to publicize it a little bit better and and uh you know go to the schools and
sw2349B-ms98-a-0031 142.997500 156.401875 do programs and tell them_1 that we need your help and you know uh uh volunteer for such and such a time and you you have a choice of where you wanna go and and and that way handling it that way they could probably get some results out of it
sw2349B-ms98-a-0032 156.401875 159.993375 [silence]
sw2349B-ms98-a-0033 159.993375 162.489375 yeah in their own community right
sw2349B-ms98-a-0034 162.489375 166.457375 [silence]
sw2349B-ms98-a-0035 166.457375 174.985375 yeah that's true [laughter] most of them_1 probably wouldn't do something like that although there are a lot of kids who would do it just to get away from their [laughter-parents]
sw2349B-ms98-a-0036 174.985375 182.137250 [laughter] but they would have to be supportive in some way and i'm not sure those those programs are available to do that
sw2349B-ms98-a-0037 182.137250 185.007625 [silence]
sw2349B-ms98-a-0038 185.007625 186.452375 right
sw2349B-ms98-a-0039 186.452375 188.765125 [silence]
sw2349B-ms98-a-0040 188.765125 191.884500 right exactly that's
sw2349B-ms98-a-0041 191.884500 199.558125 yeah it is tough it's a[nd]- and i don't know who's even proposing it or or how they plan on implementing it if they do
sw2349B-ms98-a-0042 199.558125 206.238625 [silence]
sw2349B-ms98-a-0043 206.238625 207.865125 yeah
sw2349B-ms98-a-0044 207.865125 220.230000 yeah i think going to the schools would be the easiest for them_1 you know it'd be it it wouldn't take up much much it would take up more time than anything but it wouldn't take up a lot of money they wouldn't have to spend money advertising and things like that
sw2349B-ms98-a-0045 220.230000 228.034750 you go to school and you have a kind of a captive audience you get them_1 all in the auditorium and you you know give them_1 your speech and maybe a little slide show or something and
sw2349B-ms98-a-0046 228.034750 238.096375 and i think that they could get some results from that because_1 there are a lot of people who are volunteer and community minded but they don't know where to go to to to do anything
sw2349B-ms98-a-0047 238.096375 241.255000 yeah it is it really is
sw2349B-ms98-a-0048 241.255000 246.310625 [silence]
sw2349B-ms98-a-0049 246.310625 248.442625 right yeah
sw2349B-ms98-a-0050 248.442625 250.045875 yeah

sw2349B-ms98-a-0056 261.404875 263.561375 i don't either [laughter]
sw2349B-ms98-a-0057 263.561375 265.438625 that's what
sw2349B-ms98-a-0058 265.438625 267.803250 yeah it is a tough question
sw2349B-ms98-a-0059 267.803250 269.602750 [noise]
sw2349B-ms98-a-0060 269.602750 275.527125 sure same here ta[ke]- you too [noise] bye-bye [noise]
