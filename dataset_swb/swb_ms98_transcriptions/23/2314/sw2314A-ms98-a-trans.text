sw2314A-ms98-a-0002 1.310500 9.234375 well i i don't think that it's it's wrong for a company to require drug testing for certain types of positions for instance
sw2314A-ms98-a-0003 9.234375 17.566250 jobs that require use of heavy machinery and things like that where there's where there's uh endangerment to their own life and other people's lives

sw2314A-ms98-a-0011 46.943875 53.552750 well how do you f[eel]- how do you feel about uh companies drug testing prior to hiring
sw2314A-ms98-a-0012 53.552750 68.017000 [silence]
sw2314A-ms98-a-0013 68.017000 69.356500 um-hum

sw2314A-ms98-a-0019 112.748125 115.526250 well what about random testing though
sw2314A-ms98-a-0020 115.526250 121.696375 d[o]- do you feel like that's an in[vasion]- invasion of certain people's rights if not everyone is tested
sw2314A-ms98-a-0021 121.696375 128.196750 [silence]
sw2314A-ms98-a-0022 128.196750 134.030375 i don't know that you do if it's random then it's random and that's not necessarily fair
sw2314A-ms98-a-0023 134.030375 135.428000 [silence]

sw2314A-ms98-a-0026 145.905125 147.230000 yeah
sw2314A-ms98-a-0027 147.230000 153.238375 well i ha[ppen]- i know that for instance in the NC double A they drug test and it's not random
sw2314A-ms98-a-0028 153.238375 157.658875 [silence]
sw2314A-ms98-a-0029 157.658875 167.496500 um well i think all college players have to do an initial drug test at a certain point prior to the season and from that point on uh
sw2314A-ms98-a-0030 167.496500 172.291625 at the NC double A does have something to do with it but it's almost
sw2314A-ms98-a-0031 172.291625 180.636125 discretionary on the coach's part of each in[dividual]- individually individual institution to identify the ones that have the problem
sw2314A-ms98-a-0032 180.636125 186.532125 a[nd]- and the ones that test positive have to retest after a certain period of time
sw2314A-ms98-a-0033 186.532125 200.856250 [silence]
sw2314A-ms98-a-0034 200.856250 207.897250 well not being a drug user i don't have a problem with that personally but i think that might be a violation of someone's rights if someone's
sw2314A-ms98-a-0035 207.897250 218.776750 having personal problems for some reason that's causing them to ha[ve]- behave differently and their manager assumes they have a drug problem i mean if someone assumed that of me i would be upset
sw2314A-ms98-a-0036 218.776750 223.777000 [silence]
sw2314A-ms98-a-0037 223.777000 235.923375 it's an accusation and and it's and it's b[ased]- based on on uh perception that someone has of how a drug user would behave when some drugs users behave
sw2314A-ms98-a-0038 235.923375 238.981625 uh normal uh you know
sw2314A-ms98-a-0039 238.981625 246.797125 [silence]
sw2314A-ms98-a-0040 246.797125 249.464625 right exactly i[t]- it i don't
sw2314A-ms98-a-0041 249.464625 259.205125 the i think almost the only way that drug testing can be done fairly is if it's across the board from from the janitors to the executive management

sw2314A-ms98-a-0045 272.149500 274.761750 what type of job do you have
sw2314A-ms98-a-0046 274.761750 275.923625 [silence]
sw2314A-ms98-a-0047 275.923625 277.256875 uh-huh
sw2314A-ms98-a-0048 277.256875 293.552500 [silence]
sw2314A-ms98-a-0049 293.552500 302.671000 well does your j[ob]- re[quire]- does your job require you to drive company equipment or to [vocalized-noise] operate any type of machinery that might en[danger]- endanger someone
sw2314A-ms98-a-0050 302.671000 305.941875 well it that doesn't i- i mean i- i
sw2314A-ms98-a-0051 305.941875 307.562250 uh-huh
sw2314A-ms98-a-0052 307.562250 309.187875 [silence]
sw2314A-ms98-a-0053 309.187875 316.045375 hum that is odd i was drug tested uh not for the job i have now but for the prior job
sw2314A-ms98-a-0054 316.045375 324.972250 uh but i know that they sent that the job i had before that well the job i have have now requested my uh uh
sw2314A-ms98-a-0055 324.972250 326.376125 [silence]
sw2314A-ms98-a-0056 326.376125 330.598375 my uh medical record from my old company
sw2314A-ms98-a-0057 330.598375 340.981250 so i don't know if i wasn't drug tested based on that or because the man who hired me didn't request the drug test because i know that my company does drug testing on occasion
sw2314A-ms98-a-0058 340.981250 357.380375 [silence]
sw2314A-ms98-a-0059 357.380375 367.837500 well no i don't think they can they can force another company to not drug test me just by saying that i i didn't i mean th[ey]- they don't know that i don't use drugs they just tested me once
sw2314A-ms98-a-0060 367.837500 369.561000 [silence]
sw2314A-ms98-a-0061 369.561000 376.211875 but i used to work for a power company so it was very important that they make sure their employees especially linemen
sw2314A-ms98-a-0062 376.211875 379.115500 uh were clean
sw2314A-ms98-a-0063 379.115500 392.107500 and since i was just you know one of the office folk i guess it wasn't as important to them that they test me regularly but i know they test most of the service people fairly regularly re[gularly]- uh just across the board
sw2314A-ms98-a-0064 392.107500 395.729000 [silence]
sw2314A-ms98-a-0065 395.729000 400.298750 no they're all of them_1 are tested once every three mo[nths]- it's a rotation
sw2314A-ms98-a-0066 400.298750 402.614750 [silence]
sw2314A-ms98-a-0067 402.614750 410.563875 but it but again it depends on what job you're in the men that are out there fixing power lines are tested a lot
sw2314A-ms98-a-0068 410.563875 416.721375 and the men that drive the trucks with with the guys that fix the power lines aren't tested as much
sw2314A-ms98-a-0069 416.721375 427.488875 but but see they make that clear to them_1 as they hire those guys what the what the drug testing schedule is they say we we're testing you tomorrow and we'll test you every three months thereafter while you work here
sw2314A-ms98-a-0070 427.488875 430.116625 [silence]
sw2314A-ms98-a-0071 430.116625 433.787125 yeah it's it's made very clear upon hiring
sw2314A-ms98-a-0072 433.787125 438.323750 [silence]
sw2314A-ms98-a-0073 438.323750 442.607250 well have we spent our at least five minutes [laughter] okay [laughter]
