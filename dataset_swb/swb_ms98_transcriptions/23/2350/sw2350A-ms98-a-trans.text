sw2350A-ms98-a-0092 264.573375 268.358375 and all of the roads would be clear you'd still have the snow on the yard
sw2350A-ms98-a-0093 268.358375 276.504500 the kids could play in it but it'd be a bright sunny day and you know it would it would melt and you could drive around and it was really no big deal
