sw2323B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.481000 [noise]
sw2323B-ms98-a-0002 0.481000 4.856875 all righty so uh do you think Russia's still a threat
sw2323B-ms98-a-0003 4.856875 10.248625 [silence]
sw2323B-ms98-a-0004 10.248625 11.851500 [noise] there you go
sw2323B-ms98-a-0005 11.851500 31.837875 [silence]
sw2323B-ms98-a-0006 31.837875 35.429625 well i think h[ave]- have you ever read the book nineteen eighty four
sw2323B-ms98-a-0007 35.429625 41.055500 okay you know like how uh these two there was like three continents that were always fighting with each other
sw2323B-ms98-a-0008 41.055500 51.698875 right and you could picture it as being Russia versus the US d[uring]- during the whole time and what they would do is they would get their prisoners and kill them as soon as they got them
sw2323B-ms98-a-0009 51.698875 60.508750 because the people there could realize that they were the same as as themselves you know the prisoners of wars were were the same as the people living in that country
sw2323B-ms98-a-0010 60.508750 71.057500 and you didn't want that to happen and to me it had always been that way i mean what happens is you have a government right and this government controls everything right
sw2323B-ms98-a-0011 71.057500 79.094875 and then you have the people inhabiting the country and these people have nothing to do with the government itself and these people are the same as you are
sw2323B-ms98-a-0012 79.094875 91.532000 and what goes on is that every time somebody attacks a country supposedly US or Russia attacks a country it's not going to be within the borders of the US or Russia itself
sw2323B-ms98-a-0013 91.532000 98.631000 like i was telling people i'm really mad because the whole thing in the Middle East this was going on in Lith[uania]- in Lithuania
sw2323B-ms98-a-0014 98.631000 101.931500 they they were announced to be a separate country
sw2323B-ms98-a-0015 101.931500 112.969000 but yet the the government that's in Moscow told its army to go in there and get those people and the US didn't go in there and try to save those people
sw2323B-ms98-a-0016 112.969000 120.427375 you know it's like you're not going to go in there and say no listen there's a separate country why because you're going into the border
sw2323B-ms98-a-0017 120.427375 129.733750 right once you get into the border then there's a threat but what happens is you don't mess with us we won't mess with you but let's mess with the neutral countries
sw2323B-ms98-a-0018 129.733750 140.834000 you know and now it's like you know they're saying other people were were i guess other leaders were still crazier about it you know like other people
sw2323B-ms98-a-0019 140.834000 144.841500 you could think that they might use a bomb here and a bomb there
sw2323B-ms98-a-0020 144.841500 149.828000 but Russia has never been known for throwing an atomic bomb anywhere
sw2323B-ms98-a-0021 149.828000 152.003625 and the US has
sw2323B-ms98-a-0022 152.003625 165.395125 you know it's like they it seems like they can their their army or whatever can can go in there quicker than an atomic bomb can and do do the job with uh you know less suffering
sw2323B-ms98-a-0023 165.395125 168.484500 you know but i think i think the thing is is that
sw2323B-ms98-a-0024 168.484500 177.191625 there the thing like they were saying they go you know like Libya could start a nuclear war because of whoever is behind the button
sw2323B-ms98-a-0025 177.191625 181.510000 but not the USSR the USSR wouldn't do it
sw2323B-ms98-a-0026 181.510000 183.758750 because they got too much at stake
sw2323B-ms98-a-0027 183.758750 195.310875 [silence]
sw2323B-ms98-a-0028 195.310875 196.678750 yeah
sw2323B-ms98-a-0029 196.678750 197.680125 [silence]
sw2323B-ms98-a-0030 197.680125 199.305875 well
sw2323B-ms98-a-0031 199.305875 212.964500 my my point of view to that is is that it would have had so much i mean the attack would have been so complete on Iraq if they had i mean the first you can imagine the first uh chemical weapon used
sw2323B-ms98-a-0032 212.964500 219.759375 that would have meant a total attack of the Iraq country within you know three hours of when the weapon was shot
sw2323B-ms98-a-0033 219.759375 221.187750 [silence]
sw2323B-ms98-a-0034 221.187750 231.013250 right and what happens is what happens is suppose they get Saddam Hussein which they eventually will he's got one less thing to go against him
sw2323B-ms98-a-0035 231.013250 237.696125 i mean if he were to use that he might as well commit suicide because he's going to be captured and you know
sw2323B-ms98-a-0036 237.696125 247.790500 but the US also makes a lot of uh you know treaties with other people like saying okay if you give up then you can come live in our country and we'll take care of you like Marcos right
sw2323B-ms98-a-0037 247.790500 252.392625 we'll overthrow you but yet you can still come live here you know
sw2323B-ms98-a-0038 252.392625 254.477875 [silence]
sw2323B-ms98-a-0039 254.477875 256.133625 [laughter-uh] no 
sw2323B-ms98-a-0040 256.133625 257.522125 no
sw2323B-ms98-a-0041 257.522125 265.922750 [silence]
sw2323B-ms98-a-0042 265.922750 267.194125 yeah
sw2323B-ms98-a-0043 267.194125 274.203000 [silence]
sw2323B-ms98-a-0044 274.203000 275.498000 right
sw2323B-ms98-a-0045 275.498000 277.210125 [silence]
sw2323B-ms98-a-0046 277.210125 278.572375 right
sw2323B-ms98-a-0047 278.572375 281.595875 and uh you know there's there's just
sw2323B-ms98-a-0048 281.595875 291.306875 you know like people will go like they like the U S goes and goes into Panama and what see i don't believe in war that's my thing i don't believe that anybody should die
sw2323B-ms98-a-0049 291.306875 304.207500 you know and so then you know you have because what happens is suppose i'm i go to war and i'm holding a gun and i'm just looking at myself holding a gun and whoever shoots first survives you know
sw2323B-ms98-a-0050 304.207500 313.344875 but that same person also has a family and you know his parents are going to cry and you know life ends there and to me that's ridiculous
sw2323B-ms98-a-0051 313.344875 319.475625 you know i mean i just don't believe it i think there are other ways to fix it even though sometimes there aren't but
sw2323B-ms98-a-0052 319.475625 326.985125 it's pretty hard to think that you know people are just going to shoot each other down and it's legal in a situation like that you know
sw2323B-ms98-a-0053 326.985125 329.176625 [silence]
sw2323B-ms98-a-0054 329.176625 330.538750 yeah
sw2323B-ms98-a-0055 330.538750 333.359875 [silence]
sw2323B-ms98-a-0056 333.359875 341.353625 yeah i mean i mean Saddam Hussein lost so much money during the war that it was ridiculous and he all he was trying to do was make money at the beginning so
sw2323B-ms98-a-0057 341.353625 344.892000 and keep his power but well
sw2323B-ms98-a-0058 344.892000 348.322500 [silence]
sw2323B-ms98-a-0059 348.322500 358.825875 no i i don't think so i think uh and they're getting they're especially getting their life back together now because a lot of things that you saw on TV a lot of uh inhabitants of Russia 
sw2323B-ms98-a-0060 358.825875 366.138750 would love to stay in their country just as long as they were able to express what they wanted to a lot of like dancers and stuff like that
sw2323B-ms98-a-0061 366.138750 372.676500 they said that they wouldn't leave Russia unless Russia told them that they couldn't travel anymore and compete
sw2323B-ms98-a-0062 372.676500 376.190125 so it must be a beautiful country it's just that you know
sw2323B-ms98-a-0063 376.190125 380.491375 they won't let you get out and when you want to get out of the country that's what you want to do
sw2323B-ms98-a-0064 380.491375 383.802375 so oh well i got to go to class now
sw2323B-ms98-a-0065 383.802375 386.083375 nice talking to you bye-bye
sw2323B-ms98-a-0066 386.083375 387.478000 [noise]
