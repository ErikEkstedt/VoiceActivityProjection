sw2319B-ms98-a-0003 4.572125 10.040125 uh somewhat they're not my favorite team but uh [laughter-yeah] i am uh somewhat familiar with them 
sw2319B-ms98-a-0004 10.040125 11.839875 [silence]
sw2319B-ms98-a-0005 11.839875 14.361500 i follow the Milwaukee Brewers mostly
sw2319B-ms98-a-0006 14.361500 18.967375 basically be[cause]- because that's where i came from and uh grew up following them as a kid
sw2319B-ms98-a-0007 18.967375 29.572250 [silence]
sw2319B-ms98-a-0008 29.572250 31.025125 okay
sw2319B-ms98-a-0009 31.025125 34.357000 [silence]
sw2319B-ms98-a-0010 34.357000 36.288625 well uh
sw2319B-ms98-a-0011 36.288625 36.851000 [laughter]
sw2319B-ms98-a-0012 36.851000 39.913625 i don't think they're going to challenge for the lead in the east
sw2319B-ms98-a-0013 39.913625 43.227875 uh they they've got a lot of uh rebuilding to do
sw2319B-ms98-a-0014 43.227875 52.005000 they traded for a lot of new players uh in in the off season and it looks like it might help them but uh i think this is going to be a year for pulling together and looking for the future 
sw2319B-ms98-a-0015 52.005000 53.430500 yeah uh-huh
sw2319B-ms98-a-0016 53.430500 66.676625 [silence]
sw2319B-ms98-a-0017 66.676625 69.926875 well there's been some talk that they're going to trade Pete Incaviglia
sw2319B-ms98-a-0018 69.926875 84.272250 [silence]
sw2319B-ms98-a-0019 84.272250 85.484750 [laughter] okay
sw2319B-ms98-a-0020 85.484750 87.952750 they might just be fishing to see what they can get for him
sw2319B-ms98-a-0021 87.952750 92.671375 [silence]
sw2319B-ms98-a-0022 92.671375 93.929000 yeah
sw2319B-ms98-a-0023 93.929000 96.543500 [silence]
sw2319B-ms98-a-0024 96.543500 105.023625 yeah i agree they're paying him too much money and uh f[or]- for the kind of money they're paying him right now i think it's one point six million dollars they can get a pretty good quality outfielder
sw2319B-ms98-a-0025 105.023625 111.030875 [silence]
sw2319B-ms98-a-0026 111.030875 114.203750 yeah i'm looking forward to seeing Nolan Ryan pitch
sw2319B-ms98-a-0027 114.203750 115.477500 but uh
sw2319B-ms98-a-0028 115.477500 116.483750 [silence]
sw2319B-ms98-a-0029 116.483750 119.469750 i think the rest of the staff is uh a little weak
sw2319B-ms98-a-0030 119.469750 129.666500 [silence]
sw2319B-ms98-a-0031 129.666500 130.920375 right
sw2319B-ms98-a-0032 130.920375 132.730625 [silence]
sw2319B-ms98-a-0033 132.730625 134.562375 he's hot and cold
sw2319B-ms98-a-0034 134.562375 138.291750 he'll have an outstanding outing and the next time he'll get shelled
sw2319B-ms98-a-0035 138.291750 140.118500 so [laughter]
sw2319B-ms98-a-0036 140.118500 148.965375 [silence]
sw2319B-ms98-a-0037 148.965375 150.294250 yeah
sw2319B-ms98-a-0038 150.294250 155.959625 [silence]
sw2319B-ms98-a-0039 155.959625 158.091750 [laughter]
sw2319B-ms98-a-0040 158.091750 159.705000 i see
sw2319B-ms98-a-0041 159.705000 161.281750 [silence]
sw2319B-ms98-a-0042 161.281750 164.737000 i guess Ruben Sierra's got an entirely new attitude this season
sw2319B-ms98-a-0043 164.737000 165.748875 [silence]
sw2319B-ms98-a-0044 165.748875 167.623000 he claims to be out there to play ball
sw2319B-ms98-a-0045 167.623000 172.898500 [silence]
sw2319B-ms98-a-0046 172.898500 175.454125 yeah they say he's really been hustling
sw2319B-ms98-a-0047 175.454125 176.548000 never
sw2319B-ms98-a-0048 176.548000 181.434875 [silence]
sw2319B-ms98-a-0049 181.434875 182.732875 yeah
sw2319B-ms98-a-0050 182.732875 185.345250 [silence]
sw2319B-ms98-a-0051 185.345250 191.152000 well i felt a little guilty but not much when uh Robin Yount won the MVP instead of Sierra
sw2319B-ms98-a-0052 191.152000 192.719500 the other year
sw2319B-ms98-a-0053 192.719500 202.811375 but uh Yount has been a he's he's a player uh year in year out and always uh is leading the team in uh most of most of their offensive categories 
sw2319B-ms98-a-0054 202.811375 204.568375 he really is a team player
sw2319B-ms98-a-0055 204.568375 205.571250 [silence]
sw2319B-ms98-a-0056 205.571250 206.844125 yeah
sw2319B-ms98-a-0057 206.844125 209.594375 Sierra hasn't shown that kind of maturity yet
sw2319B-ms98-a-0058 209.594375 228.696500 [silence]
sw2319B-ms98-a-0059 228.696500 234.688625 yeah and he hasn't really shown the the talent uh or the promise that they saw when he was at Oklahoma State
sw2319B-ms98-a-0060 234.688625 240.497750 [silence]
sw2319B-ms98-a-0061 240.497750 242.462625 Juan Gonzalez
sw2319B-ms98-a-0062 242.462625 246.269000 yeah he looks to be a a up and coming uh performer
sw2319B-ms98-a-0063 246.269000 252.581625 [silence]
sw2319B-ms98-a-0064 252.581625 255.479000 well given the Rangers' history they'll probably trade him
sw2319B-ms98-a-0065 255.479000 256.135125 [laughter]
sw2319B-ms98-a-0066 256.135125 257.410375 and then he'll
sw2319B-ms98-a-0067 257.410375 259.555500 right somewhere else
sw2319B-ms98-a-0068 259.555500 262.418500 that that seems to be the way the Rangers operate
sw2319B-ms98-a-0069 262.418500 270.931625 [silence]
sw2319B-ms98-a-0070 270.931625 272.968125 how do you think Oakland's going to do
sw2319B-ms98-a-0071 272.968125 279.115000 [silence]
sw2319B-ms98-a-0072 279.115000 283.751375 for what they're paying they ought to get they ought to get the performance out of those guys uh
sw2319B-ms98-a-0073 283.751375 286.419750 Canseco's making five million a year
sw2319B-ms98-a-0074 286.419750 293.331500 [silence]
sw2319B-ms98-a-0075 293.331500 294.301000 yeah
sw2319B-ms98-a-0076 294.301000 302.930750 [silence]
sw2319B-ms98-a-0077 302.930750 304.352125 yeah i i agree
sw2319B-ms98-a-0078 304.352125 313.588125 i think it is and when when the players themselves are turning down contracts that are three or four years in duration for three or four million dollars a year looking for more money yet
sw2319B-ms98-a-0079 313.588125 321.832750 [silence]
sw2319B-ms98-a-0080 321.832750 323.111125 sure
sw2319B-ms98-a-0081 323.111125 325.174875 [silence]
sw2319B-ms98-a-0082 325.174875 333.683125 well it's it's a bidding war between teams and it's also popularity contest between sports to see who can get the biggest uh paycheck
sw2319B-ms98-a-0083 333.683125 335.438125 because baseball
sw2319B-ms98-a-0084 335.438125 340.061125 [silence]
sw2319B-ms98-a-0085 340.061125 343.018625 that's true they keep raising the ticket prices every year
sw2319B-ms98-a-0086 343.018625 349.195125 [silence]
sw2319B-ms98-a-0087 349.195125 359.722125 yeah and with what those guys get paid then they go out uh besides baseball and and advertise products or they they charge ten or fifteen dollars for a autograph
sw2319B-ms98-a-0088 359.722125 361.185875 [laughter]
sw2319B-ms98-a-0089 361.185875 366.423625 they've got all this supplemental income coming in as if they aren't making enough already as uh stars of the sport
sw2319B-ms98-a-0090 366.423625 383.754625 [silence]
sw2319B-ms98-a-0091 383.754625 385.055375 yeah
sw2319B-ms98-a-0092 385.055375 392.885125 [silence]
sw2319B-ms98-a-0093 392.885125 401.361125 sure yeah i might get to maybe one game out of the year uh in person uh but uh having cable TV and HSE [laughter]
sw2319B-ms98-a-0094 401.361125 403.758875 [silence]
sw2319B-ms98-a-0095 403.758875 406.454750 yeah i'll watch quite a few games on TV
sw2319B-ms98-a-0096 406.454750 408.744250 especially to somebody like Nolan pitch
sw2319B-ms98-a-0097 408.744250 410.997125 [silence]
sw2319B-ms98-a-0098 410.997125 414.616125 Brewers always have such hard luck Teddy Higuera is hurt again
sw2319B-ms98-a-0099 414.616125 419.200375 he was supposed to pitch an exhibition in Mexico against Fernando Valenzuela
sw2319B-ms98-a-0100 419.200375 421.688250 and uh he had a torn rotator cup
sw2319B-ms98-a-0101 421.688250 428.037250 so he's out for at least uh oh i don't know how many weeks or months they said
sw2319B-ms98-a-0102 428.037250 430.550125 but he may not pitch this season again
sw2319B-ms98-a-0103 430.550125 432.534500 [silence]
sw2319B-ms98-a-0104 432.534500 437.885875 but he's the star of that uh team their pitching staff and when he sits out they fizzle
sw2319B-ms98-a-0105 437.885875 439.164500 [silence]
sw2319B-ms98-a-0106 439.164500 445.275875 that seems typical because most of their other stars uh Paul Molitor's usually out half the season with injuries himself
sw2319B-ms98-a-0107 445.275875 451.225250 [silence]
sw2319B-ms98-a-0108 451.225250 461.146875 yeah they end up juggling the lineup and trying to fit uh [vocalized-noise] more inexperienced players into those roles and they just don't have the leadership don't have the skills to carry a team 
sw2319B-ms98-a-0109 461.146875 465.385250 [silence]
sw2319B-ms98-a-0110 465.385250 468.471750 well i think it will be fun i'm ready for baseball season to start
sw2319B-ms98-a-0111 468.471750 479.030500 [silence]
sw2319B-ms98-a-0112 479.030500 481.446250 yeah ah i agree with that 
sw2319B-ms98-a-0113 481.446250 482.449125 [silence]
sw2319B-ms98-a-0114 482.449125 485.337375 right well the preseason really doesn't mean anything either
sw2319B-ms98-a-0115 485.337375 491.808875 because the play[ers]- the teams uh usually play in split squads and they're either playing their rookies or their uh
sw2319B-ms98-a-0116 491.808875 492.824250 uh
sw2319B-ms98-a-0117 492.824250 493.977375 [silence]
sw2319B-ms98-a-0118 493.977375 495.165250 yeah
sw2319B-ms98-a-0119 495.165250 496.945500 [silence]
sw2319B-ms98-a-0120 496.945500 503.222250 so once the season gets underway you know they're out there to be serious about what they're doing trying to win games and uh [laughter]
sw2319B-ms98-a-0121 503.222250 504.649125 i take it from there
sw2319B-ms98-a-0122 504.649125 511.944625 [silence]
sw2319B-ms98-a-0123 511.944625 516.259875 okay well good luck to the Rangers this season [laughter] see if they can pull one out
sw2319B-ms98-a-0124 516.259875 518.016750 all right sure thanks bye
sw2319B-ms98-a-0125 518.016750 519.869875 [noise]
