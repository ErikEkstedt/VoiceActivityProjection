sw2319A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.251875 [noise]
sw2319A-ms98-a-0002 1.251875 5.524875 uh i guess being here in Dallas are you familiar with the Rangers
sw2319A-ms98-a-0003 5.524875 6.934125 okay
sw2319A-ms98-a-0004 6.934125 9.343375 [laughter]
sw2319A-ms98-a-0005 9.343375 12.384125 i see what team do you follow
sw2319A-ms98-a-0006 12.384125 13.565750 [silence]
sw2319A-ms98-a-0007 13.565750 15.201500 i see
sw2319A-ms98-a-0008 15.201500 18.334125 [silence]
sw2319A-ms98-a-0009 18.334125 22.373750 okay okay that's interesting
sw2319A-ms98-a-0010 22.373750 30.411500 i guess really though i'm a native Texan so that really the about the only team i've ever uh followed has been the Rangers
sw2319A-ms98-a-0011 30.411500 34.900500 and uh uh what do you think Milwaukee's going to do this year
sw2319A-ms98-a-0012 34.900500 39.049625 [silence]
sw2319A-ms98-a-0013 39.049625 40.785500 is that right
sw2319A-ms98-a-0014 40.785500 50.502500 [silence]
sw2319A-ms98-a-0015 50.502500 54.014375 sort of a building seas[on]- season yeah
sw2319A-ms98-a-0016 54.014375 57.940500 shoot the Rangers i don't know what the there's no telling what they'll do they'll proba[bly]-
sw2319A-ms98-a-0017 57.940500 68.334250 uh they won't do anything until the all star break and then uh then they'll perk up a little bit and that seems to be their uh their average pace but 
sw2319A-ms98-a-0018 68.334250 70.066500 [silence]
sw2319A-ms98-a-0019 70.066500 77.404125 yeah uh i heard that but i heard on uh uh the radio this morning that that uh
sw2319A-ms98-a-0020 77.404125 85.429250 you know old Bobby Valentine said that there was no no uh truth to that but you never can tell
sw2319A-ms98-a-0021 85.429250 87.444125 [silence]
sw2319A-ms98-a-0022 87.444125 97.994000 that's right and i don't know personally i'd like to get rid of him i think he's sort of a showboat and really hadn't produced you know a whole lot but uh
sw2319A-ms98-a-0023 97.994000 102.454125 [silence]
sw2319A-ms98-a-0024 102.454125 103.727500 right
sw2319A-ms98-a-0025 103.727500 104.729625 [silence]
sw2319A-ms98-a-0026 104.729625 111.930250 yeah when [vocalized-noise] they're going to have to spend some money and i think build up their pitching staff uh 
sw2319A-ms98-a-0027 111.930250 113.487500 [silence]
sw2319A-ms98-a-0028 113.487500 117.128750 yeah it would be interesting to see how he does this year
sw2319A-ms98-a-0029 117.128750 118.965875 [silence]
sw2319A-ms98-a-0030 118.965875 130.278750 yeah i heard uh just i guess last night they got beat uh and Bobby Witt was the pitcher and he's supposed to be uh you know their their hot guy
sw2319A-ms98-a-0031 130.278750 133.729750 and uh sounded like he got pounded pretty hard
sw2319A-ms98-a-0032 133.729750 135.185500 yeah
sw2319A-ms98-a-0033 135.185500 137.394250 [silence]
sw2319A-ms98-a-0034 137.394250 145.094875 right and and that's really what the Rangers need some some consistency you know outer starter
sw2319A-ms98-a-0035 145.094875 148.982375 and uh uh i don't know it's going to be interesting
sw2319A-ms98-a-0036 148.982375 153.580125 uh my at work my boss got season tickets this year
sw2319A-ms98-a-0037 153.580125 161.970750 so uh hopefully if i'm real nice to him he's going throw a couple of those my way every now and then so it will be fun to go out there and watch them
sw2319A-ms98-a-0038 161.970750 164.913750 [silence]
sw2319A-ms98-a-0039 164.913750 174.344000 that's what they said that uh he really worked out you know hard in off season and uh maybe he can catch a fly ball or two this year
sw2319A-ms98-a-0040 174.344000 181.811875 right God he need to i mean he's got all the talent in the world when it comes around to to hitting the baseball
sw2319A-ms98-a-0041 181.811875 185.979750 but uh i mean you got to be a total player when you're in the pros
sw2319A-ms98-a-0042 185.979750 190.542750 [silence]
sw2319A-ms98-a-0043 190.542750 191.652625 yeah
sw2319A-ms98-a-0044 191.652625 192.658375 [silence]
sw2319A-ms98-a-0045 192.658375 194.972875 yeah uh i don't know 
sw2319A-ms98-a-0046 194.972875 201.958750 [silence]
sw2319A-ms98-a-0047 201.958750 203.476625 is that right
sw2319A-ms98-a-0048 203.476625 204.483500 [silence]
sw2319A-ms98-a-0049 204.483500 207.868000 well that's what it takes to uh because uh
sw2319A-ms98-a-0050 207.868000 209.762500 [silence]
sw2319A-ms98-a-0051 209.762500 214.009500 right to to actually be a leader uh a team leader
sw2319A-ms98-a-0052 214.009500 222.822625 and uh you know the Rangers really don't have any star players besides Ryan that uh i think the other players look up to
sw2319A-ms98-a-0053 222.822625 229.305125 because Incaviglia i don't think you know uh he stands out to be a a real leader
sw2319A-ms98-a-0054 229.305125 233.443750 [silence]
sw2319A-ms98-a-0055 233.443750 243.165875 right right sounds like they have a young guy that they're putting a lot of weight into uh that Juan Gonzalez yeah
sw2319A-ms98-a-0056 243.165875 245.577750 [silence]
sw2319A-ms98-a-0057 245.577750 253.467250 yeah so it be interesting to see you know i think and make him progress and uh get him on board 
sw2319A-ms98-a-0058 253.467250 255.219625 [silence]
sw2319A-ms98-a-0059 255.219625 257.975125 [laughter] and then he'll become an all star
sw2319A-ms98-a-0060 257.975125 260.205875 [laughter]
sw2319A-ms98-a-0061 260.205875 261.564750 that's right
sw2319A-ms98-a-0062 261.564750 263.806250 that's exactly right
sw2319A-ms98-a-0063 263.806250 265.446125 but uh
sw2319A-ms98-a-0064 265.446125 272.036125 well i'll tell you what it will be interesting to to get the baseball season going and see how everything turns out
sw2319A-ms98-a-0065 272.036125 273.430250 [silence]
sw2319A-ms98-a-0066 273.430250 278.690625 i don't know i tell you what they've uh they've got a big enough payroll they need to uh uh
sw2319A-ms98-a-0067 278.690625 279.709750 [silence]
sw2319A-ms98-a-0068 279.709750 281.349625 go back
sw2319A-ms98-a-0069 281.349625 282.462875 [silence]
sw2319A-ms98-a-0070 282.462875 284.933000 that's exactly right
sw2319A-ms98-a-0071 284.933000 286.751000 [silence]
sw2319A-ms98-a-0072 286.751000 293.284125 yeah and i i just don't see uh you know a baseball player being worth that
sw2319A-ms98-a-0073 293.284125 304.024125 [vocalized-noise] or any really any pro pro athlete because we look at that compared to what uh normal people make i mean it's just totally outrageous 
sw2319A-ms98-a-0074 304.024125 305.898250 and uh
sw2319A-ms98-a-0075 305.898250 311.017750 [silence]
sw2319A-ms98-a-0076 311.017750 322.546125 yeah -[th]at that that's what ticks me off about old uh Henderson you know wanting to rene[gotiate]- renegotiate his contract because uh uh he's not the highest paid player anymore 
sw2319A-ms98-a-0077 322.546125 325.500500 well man that's that's just ridiculous
sw2319A-ms98-a-0078 325.500500 330.617250 [silence]
sw2319A-ms98-a-0079 330.617250 331.896000 right
sw2319A-ms98-a-0080 331.896000 332.901750 [silence]
sw2319A-ms98-a-0081 332.901750 341.902000 exactly and you know ultimately the the consumer and the uh fan are the people that have to pay for it through the
sw2319A-ms98-a-0082 341.902000 350.880625 right and through advertisements you know on TV uh because a TV contract is really where they rake in the money and
sw2319A-ms98-a-0083 350.880625 359.129750 [silence]
sw2319A-ms98-a-0084 359.129750 361.889125 right that's right

sw2319A-ms98-a-0087 368.923125 376.543375 you know so i i don't know personally uh you know i'll pay keep paying whatever the ticket prices are but
sw2319A-ms98-a-0088 376.543375 384.239375 and uh it really does irk me to see those guys out there uh you know making that much money
sw2319A-ms98-a-0089 384.239375 393.813000 and uh and then the the public you know just continues to you know help support and funnel the funds into uh to make it happen whatever it costs
sw2319A-ms98-a-0090 393.813000 397.488500 [silence]
sw2319A-ms98-a-0091 397.488500 398.903500 right
