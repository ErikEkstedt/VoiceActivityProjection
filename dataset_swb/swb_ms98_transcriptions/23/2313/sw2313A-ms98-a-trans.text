sw2313A-ms98-a-0002 0.701250 3.169125 well how many credit cards do you have
sw2313A-ms98-a-0003 3.169125 24.082625 [silence]
sw2313A-ms98-a-0004 24.082625 30.032625 [laughter] sounds like we have no conflict we had for a while i was carrying one card and my wife was carrying a different one
sw2313A-ms98-a-0005 30.032625 39.832875 and since the slips all look alike uh you commingle them and then you get the statement and you try to sort them_1 out and it and it uh
sw2313A-ms98-a-0006 39.832875 50.302875 [laughter-it] it causes more confusion about it i finally said gee this is kind of a waste of time and then when AT&T came along and offered a free one uh i accepted that and we've been using that one
sw2313A-ms98-a-0007 50.302875 59.147250 uh the interesting thing is is that uh the amount of money you can can run up on them i don't know do you know any people that run up big big bills
sw2313A-ms98-a-0008 59.147250 65.557125 [silence]
sw2313A-ms98-a-0009 65.557125 69.190625 well did um were you able to get one while you're in college
sw2313A-ms98-a-0010 69.190625 72.119125 [silence]
sw2313A-ms98-a-0011 72.119125 84.979375 just curious because_1 i have a son that's a senior this year and he's heading off with any kind of luck but there has been i've had a couple of ads for a for for to provide a card for a college student
sw2313A-ms98-a-0012 84.979375 88.744625 uh what do you think about the idea of providing one for somebody like that
sw2313A-ms98-a-0013 88.744625 105.306750 [silence]
sw2313A-ms98-a-0014 105.306750 118.550625 well that that that i guess from the from the card issuer uh that since since it's it's in mo[nitor]- the parent gets it for them that really the parent becomes the one that's responsible but it's
sw2313A-ms98-a-0015 118.550625 119.669125 [silence]
sw2313A-ms98-a-0016 119.669125 122.597625 yes it's whether the parent wants to take the risk
sw2313A-ms98-a-0017 122.597625 123.617000 [silence]
sw2313A-ms98-a-0018 123.617000 134.034000 yeah to to go run up a big bill and the thing is there some [vocalized-noise] there some advantages if he got off some place and stranded i i'm i'm leaning towards doing it for for conven[ience]-
sw2313A-ms98-a-0019 134.034000 136.022750 [silence]
sw2313A-ms98-a-0020 136.022750 137.863750 a convenience
sw2313A-ms98-a-0021 137.863750 144.492250 yeah and the idea that you know if he got in trouble there's some some ways of getting out and that he doesn't have to carry cash
sw2313A-ms98-a-0022 144.492250 155.372250 the uh i i like the idea of credit cards that uh i don't i don't i don't carry cash around and and uh i don't even carry checks around i let my wife take the checkbook a[nd]-
sw2313A-ms98-a-0023 155.372250 158.337750 she writes the checks and i record them so it's uh
sw2313A-ms98-a-0024 158.337750 166.650000 it's uh it's but it's interesting that uh the people that can that can uh the amounts of money you can run up wi[th]-
sw2313A-ms98-a-0025 166.650000 177.965375 on on credit cards and uh i i had recently had some dealings with a fellow that they had run up he was making oh considered a modest salary for an engineer
sw2313A-ms98-a-0026 177.965375 185.136250 and he had run up uh more than a years salary in in various debts to
sw2313A-ms98-a-0027 185.136250 191.351000 and he wound up declaring bankruptcy but there it it's hard to believe that you'd run up twenty thirty thousand dollars of
sw2313A-ms98-a-0028 191.351000 195.606125 uh well it was a combination of things he had uh there were
sw2313A-ms98-a-0029 195.606125 206.338625 there were several credit cards and then there were several other businesses but uh i i guess what's interesting have you seen the uh the the the the ads where they're offering to extend payments on
sw2313A-ms98-a-0030 206.338625 210.748750 uh things like uh like the credit union's offering
sw2313A-ms98-a-0031 210.748750 211.820250 [silence]
sw2313A-ms98-a-0032 211.820250 212.959125 yes
sw2313A-ms98-a-0033 212.959125 214.339625 yeah
sw2313A-ms98-a-0034 214.339625 222.831500 the interesting thing about that is is that uh that that they're encouraging you to incur more incur more debt and
sw2313A-ms98-a-0035 222.831500 225.818625 [silence]
sw2313A-ms98-a-0036 225.818625 228.378000 and they make more money if you extend your loan
sw2313A-ms98-a-0037 228.378000 234.311250 [silence]
sw2313A-ms98-a-0038 234.311250 235.633375 yes
sw2313A-ms98-a-0039 235.633375 240.667750 [silence]
sw2313A-ms98-a-0040 240.667750 246.718750 and they know that people own a car that new unless absolutely dire circumstances or any[thing]- they're not going to keep on if the car were older
sw2313A-ms98-a-0041 246.718750 257.697000 the interesting thing about it is is that from a uh uh an economy standpoint or in economics i i thinks it's i think it's poor poor uh economics to to carry all that consumer debt
sw2313A-ms98-a-0042 257.697000 260.435000 at least from a tax standpoint so
sw2313A-ms98-a-0043 260.435000 268.466375 it's interesting that that the American public is encouraged to incur all that debt and then next year none of it will be deductible and this year it's ten percent or so
sw2313A-ms98-a-0044 268.466375 273.284000 it's uh it's interesting that that uh they encourage us to do things
sw2313A-ms98-a-0045 273.284000 274.549250 [silence]
sw2313A-ms98-a-0046 274.549250 278.902000 i think ten percent yes of your of your consumer credit
sw2313A-ms98-a-0047 278.902000 284.226250 oh if you had a thousand dollars that means there's another hundred dollar deduction i've given you
sw2313A-ms98-a-0048 284.226250 288.209125 [silence]
sw2313A-ms98-a-0049 288.209125 291.401625 yeah it's on uh yeah
sw2313A-ms98-a-0050 291.401625 297.926875 yeah on the uh there's there's there's a place for consumer debt and then you take ten percent of it on the
sw2313A-ms98-a-0051 297.926875 299.319125 [silence]
sw2313A-ms98-a-0052 299.319125 300.707375 oh okay
sw2313A-ms98-a-0053 300.707375 303.323375 it's on it's on schedule um
sw2313A-ms98-a-0054 303.323375 306.118375 schedule a under uh
sw2313A-ms98-a-0055 306.118375 318.456125 well it's the same place it's the same place you put uh interest but but see that's what that's what makes Texas squirrelly laws that uh you can't you can't take out a a second mortgage
sw2313A-ms98-a-0056 318.456125 330.383250 uh like some states where you can take out the mortgage and declare that and so uh it's fully deductible the laws are a little squirrelly but it basically comes down to it's not in your best interest to borrow money from a tax standpoint
sw2313A-ms98-a-0057 330.383250 331.594500 but uh
sw2313A-ms98-a-0058 331.594500 333.611875 anyway [laughter]
sw2313A-ms98-a-0059 333.611875 339.544250 [silence]
sw2313A-ms98-a-0060 339.544250 344.078000 sounds like you're you're very respon[sible]- very financially responsible it's uh
sw2313A-ms98-a-0061 344.078000 352.651500 that's uh there're a lot of people who really run my boss drives quite a ways to work and he's got just enormous debts and he's
sw2313A-ms98-a-0062 352.651500 361.817125 uh but i mean what do you say it's like shucks [laughter] boss i'm sure sorry you've got all that debt well he's had had two kids in college and and this kind of thing and that
sw2313A-ms98-a-0063 361.817125 370.902375 i think that the whole credit card issue i think they certainly encourage people to run up the debts and but i agree with you i don't i try to limit my debts well i did buy a new house last summer that 
sw2313A-ms98-a-0064 370.902375 380.494500 [silence]
sw2313A-ms98-a-0065 380.494500 391.850625 it's it's remarkable how many people as soon as they get out of college buy a new car and that uh apparently that's been going on for a really long time i didn't do it i i bought a second hand car when i was the middle of my senior year
sw2313A-ms98-a-0066 391.850625 396.463625 [silence]
sw2313A-ms98-a-0067 396.463625 397.846000 yep
sw2313A-ms98-a-0068 397.846000 398.939125 [silence]
sw2313A-ms98-a-0069 398.939125 408.096875 miscellaneous things like food -[a]nd and other things these habits you get into eating and and uh it's it's it's amazing how it what you learn 
sw2313A-ms98-a-0070 408.096875 409.598625 [silence]
sw2313A-ms98-a-0071 409.598625 412.473000 well anything else good to say about credit cards
sw2313A-ms98-a-0072 412.473000 413.481000 [silence]
sw2313A-ms98-a-0073 413.481000 415.019500 i might just
sw2313A-ms98-a-0074 415.019500 420.374000 [silence]
sw2313A-ms98-a-0075 420.374000 431.747625 you don't have to carry the cash and and uh and it's it's it's certainly accepted more places than the places you know it's hard to cash a check if you're out of state and
sw2313A-ms98-a-0076 431.747625 435.601000 [silence]
sw2313A-ms98-a-0077 435.601000 436.828625 yeah
sw2313A-ms98-a-0078 436.828625 437.849000 [silence]
sw2313A-ms98-a-0079 437.849000 440.264625 they don't allow they don't do tha[t]-
sw2313A-ms98-a-0080 440.264625 448.493000 [silence]
sw2313A-ms98-a-0081 448.493000 451.385625 yeah huh
sw2313A-ms98-a-0082 451.385625 453.604250 carry all that cash with you
sw2313A-ms98-a-0083 453.604250 454.712750 [silence]
sw2313A-ms98-a-0084 454.712750 456.582875 well you know they they
sw2313A-ms98-a-0085 456.582875 463.670375 they've started towards a little bit of the debit card have you seen the debit cards where they actually debit your account when you
sw2313A-ms98-a-0086 463.670375 466.100625 yeah and i think that's where
sw2313A-ms98-a-0087 466.100625 469.252000 [silence]
sw2313A-ms98-a-0088 469.252000 476.647500 yeah i've seen a couple although the so many of the grocery stores don't do that because of the the time frame which they get paid
sw2313A-ms98-a-0089 476.647500 485.689875 in general that uh they i've seen checks deposited the very next day i mean cleared my account the next day my wife will write a check for groceries and 
sw2313A-ms98-a-0090 485.689875 499.896750 you know almost well i guess it's the day after uh technically it's two days but the[y]- the[y]- they took that check and scurried it to the bank and the bank scurried it back to my account and you thought there'd be just a little bit of float but apparently that's why the uh 
sw2313A-ms98-a-0091 499.896750 507.559250 the uh the uh grocery stores are reluctant to do that because their volume that is quite high and they have uh
sw2313A-ms98-a-0092 507.559250 511.333500 the profitability of the cash flow is a big issue for them so 
sw2313A-ms98-a-0093 511.333500 514.352375 anyway well it's good talking to you
sw2313A-ms98-a-0094 514.352375 517.718250 maybe we'll get across we'll cross paths again good night
sw2313A-ms98-a-0095 517.718250 519.046625 [noise]
sw2313A-ms98-a-0096 519.046625 520.674375 [noise]
