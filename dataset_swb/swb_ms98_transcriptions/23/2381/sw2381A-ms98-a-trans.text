sw2381A-ms98-a-0003 2.227750 30.553625 [silence]
sw2381A-ms98-a-0004 30.553625 36.525875 so you like that more civilized kind of camping you got cots [laughter]
sw2381A-ms98-a-0005 36.525875 41.134250 yeah well i'm i'm sort of a rough-and-ready camper i'll uh
sw2381A-ms98-a-0006 41.134250 43.657375 whatever i can carry on a backpack it was
sw2381A-ms98-a-0007 43.657375 45.444125 is is what i go with
sw2381A-ms98-a-0008 45.444125 49.894875 um when i was in the Air Force i used to be up in South Dakota
sw2381A-ms98-a-0009 49.894875 54.669000 and there were some really nice places up in the Black Hills to go camping
sw2381A-ms98-a-0010 54.669000 62.756250 and i had this really nice place you had to uh drive in as far as i could and then park and then you had to walk in the rest of the way
sw2381A-ms98-a-0011 62.756250 67.686875 but it was across a little stream and it was sort of um
sw2381A-ms98-a-0012 67.686875 74.159250 uh not a big area but there was a perfectly round stand of trees
sw2381A-ms98-a-0013 74.159250 79.238000 and it had a nice little area inside that course it gave you shelter and everything
sw2381A-ms98-a-0014 79.238000 81.769750 and it was right next to a nice cold stream
sw2381A-ms98-a-0015 81.769750 84.413000 so it was my favorite place
sw2381A-ms98-a-0016 84.413000 93.114750 and probably the worse thing that ever happened was around March the weather starts getting funny it will be warm one day and freezing the next
sw2381A-ms98-a-0017 93.114750 96.686625 so but that's also about the time you start getting cabin fever
sw2381A-ms98-a-0018 96.686625 102.198000 well i had cabin fever really bad so i loaded up the car and took off
sw2381A-ms98-a-0019 102.198000 107.438250 and i got up there and got camped or got got my camp setup
sw2381A-ms98-a-0020 107.438250 111.750625 and that night it got down to seventeen below and started snowing
sw2381A-ms98-a-0021 111.750625 113.212875 yeah
sw2381A-ms98-a-0022 113.212875 114.782750 [silence]
sw2381A-ms98-a-0023 114.782750 119.390500 oh i had i had a nice sleeping bag i also had uh uh catalytic heater
sw2381A-ms98-a-0024 119.390500 126.235500 um but i woke up and the snow was halfway up the the front of the tent
sw2381A-ms98-a-0025 126.235500 128.610000 i'm going oh no
sw2381A-ms98-a-0026 128.610000 133.811250 i go out i had all my stuff se[t]- i had my little campfire thing setup and my
sw2381A-ms98-a-0027 133.811250 137.309250 pots and pans and stove and all that
sw2381A-ms98-a-0028 137.309250 145.324625 and i get everything's buried under snow so i'm out there digging around so i think well to hell with it you know i'll go i'll go play around for a while
sw2381A-ms98-a-0029 145.324625 153.010750 well there's this fallen tree across the stream and these streams of course are felt fed by melted snow so they're cold anyway
sw2381A-ms98-a-0030 153.010750 157.964000 so here i am going across this snow encrusted log
sw2381A-ms98-a-0031 157.964000 160.757875 and i slipped and fell in
sw2381A-ms98-a-0032 160.757875 170.384125 and crashed through the ice right up to my neck in freezing cold weather i could just feel my heart going [vocalized-noise]
sw2381A-ms98-a-0033 170.384125 172.069750 uh
sw2381A-ms98-a-0034 172.069750 179.948500 well fortunately i had the presence of mind when i slipped i just i just went with it i didn't try to twist or anything
sw2381A-ms98-a-0035 179.948500 186.679875 and as i went i just turned and stuck my arms out and i hit the hit the log with my arms
sw2381A-ms98-a-0036 186.679875 190.351500 and that pretty much saved me from going all the way under
sw2381A-ms98-a-0037 190.351500 197.891500 um anyway i finally pulled myself out and i mean just as soon as i got out my clothes started freezing
sw2381A-ms98-a-0038 197.891500 200.018000 yeah so i i
sw2381A-ms98-a-0039 200.018000 203.910125 trotted back to the car rather quickly
sw2381A-ms98-a-0040 203.910125 210.422375 uh jumped in went home and took a hot shower and changed clothes and went back [laughter]
