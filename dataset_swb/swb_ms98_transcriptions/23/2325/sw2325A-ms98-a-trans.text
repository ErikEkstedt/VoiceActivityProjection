sw2325A-ms98-a-0056 241.092250 254.403750 after that i found another girl that had gone to church with us that you know they needed it financially she had a little boy that was the same age as my little boy and i thought well you know we'll try her but she came to our house and that just did not work
sw2325A-ms98-a-0057 254.403750 257.634750 uh i mean she loved the kids and she was good with them but
sw2325A-ms98-a-0058 257.634750 270.175625 uh you know they were [laughter-filthy] when i'd get home now i understand kids go out and play and they get [laughter-dirty] but i mean filthy i'm talking sand in the [laughter-ears] and the [laughter-eyes] and the [laughter-hair] and the and i was like gosh and then
sw2325A-ms98-a-0059 270.175625 280.023375 you know my own furniture and stuff was like you know the kitchen table the i'd find peanut butter and jelly all over the table and the chairs and the and clean and i was like
sw2325A-ms98-a-0060 280.023375 292.750250 yeah and then in the end um she basically ended up stealing a hundred dollars from me so i was i had a pretty bad taste in my mouth she told me about five thirty one afternoon it was a Friday that she wasn't keeping kids anymore as of Monday morning
sw2325A-ms98-a-0061 292.750250 297.000000 well you know i work eight to five thirty so what am i supposed to [laughter-do]

sw2325A-ms98-a-0064 308.671250 322.745625 yeah well that's what they said there were two pretty near our house and they said well bring them_1 in this week for a free day so i lined up someone Tuesday they had a Mother's Day Out that my babysitter took them_1 to you know which was fine they liked it they'd been going to it for years
sw2325A-ms98-a-0065 322.745625 336.759000 and so i stayed with them Monday Tuesday they went to that Wednesday i took them_1 to one Kindercare Thursday i took them_1 to another [laughter-KinderCare] and then on Friday my husband and i split but on Thursday i didn't like the KinderCare's they

sw2325A-ms98-a-0073 356.407125 369.473875 and doing something with him well not only was it going to cost me like a hundred and fifty dollars more a month which i didn't have [laughter] you know i didn't i you know we're we're a Christian family and you know they because they're you know
sw2325A-ms98-a-0074 369.473875 382.552125 like public they're not private you know they can't pray they can't talk about God they can't do anything like that and i don't want them_1 indoctrinated you know but i'd like them_1 to be able to say gee God made the flowers [laughter-you] [laughter-know] and things like that
sw2325A-ms98-a-0075 382.552125 387.281250 yeah yeah basic so um i talked to another l[ady]-
sw2325A-ms98-a-0076 387.281250 398.368250 lady at church it was like Thursday of that week and she said oh i found the most wonderful place that i've been taking my daughter and i've know this girl i went to college with her so i really i you i- i value her opinion
sw2325A-ms98-a-0077 398.368250 407.648500 and she told me about a private one it it was associated with one of the churches here it's not the church i go to but it's you know it it was Lubbock View Christian Church and it's a private academy
sw2325A-ms98-a-0078 407.648500 420.689500 and so i went over there and i talked to the lady well they have like a three year waiting list but she said i had a mother tell me that she may take a job in San Antonio and she has a three year old and a toddler which mine was at the time 
sw2325A-ms98-a-0079 420.689500 426.967500 and she said i should know something by tomorrow which is Friday and she said if she leaves she said i'll let you have her spot
sw2325A-ms98-a-0080 426.967500 434.147000 and so Friday afternoon at five thirty she called me and she said she's going you can bring your kids Monday [noise]
sw2325A-ms98-a-0081 434.147000 442.897375 i know i was just like God set this up for me he [laughter-knew] i needed this and uh [noise] so since October then they've been going there and
sw2325A-ms98-a-0082 442.897375 452.453750 i- i love it i have been at such peace with myself it's just been better than even when they were with my best friend because we don't have the little day to day hassles and
sw2325A-ms98-a-0083 452.453750 464.714125 the cost was not near as much as the KinderCares were going to be did you hear my printer in the background i'm sorry i hope you can understand [laughter-what] [laughter-i'm] [laughter-s[aying]-] so yeah yeah i was only about twenty dollars more a month than i was paying because 
sw2325A-ms98-a-0084 464.714125 467.643500 being a private institution they're nonprofit
sw2325A-ms98-a-0085 467.643500 476.418375 so they don't have to charge as much and the hours are wonderful and i just i think it's the best thing i told Russ yest[erday]- that we should have done this a long time ago
sw2325A-ms98-a-0086 476.418375 484.663000 you know [laughter] It's great So i guess as long as i have to work i feel good that they're there they're getting the love the care They have a little curriculum They teach them
sw2325A-ms98-a-0087 484.663000 493.807625 you know the alphabet the numbers the things which you know if they learn they learn If they don't they don't i don't feel like i have to indoctrinate them by age three but it's kind of neat when they come home with it you know and
sw2325A-ms98-a-0088 493.807625 495.103000 uh
sw2325A-ms98-a-0089 495.103000 497.359125 yeah
sw2325A-ms98-a-0090 497.359125 510.622000 oh and the teachers love [vocalized-noise] Taylor got bit several times and Taylor bit several times and the teachers dealt with that we're like hey they're two and we keep them apart and we scold them and we correct them and you know they mark it all down and they let you know and 
sw2325A-ms98-a-0091 510.622000 514.628000 and you know they get over it real quick and he doesn't do it anymore and
sw2325A-ms98-a-0092 514.628000 521.812000 they work at the potty train[ing]- i just just so mu[ch]- i don't know i just feel like a big burden was lifted [laughter] so
