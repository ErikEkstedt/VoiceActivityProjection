sw2327B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 7.136875 [silence]
sw2327B-ms98-a-0002 7.136875 8.421000 um
sw2327B-ms98-a-0003 8.421000 12.717000 i don't think that i'm paying too many tax you know too much tax myself
sw2327B-ms98-a-0004 12.717000 22.100750 uh i uh as far as uh you know federal and state uh the uh the state i live in has a five percent sales tax
sw2327B-ms98-a-0005 22.100750 27.704250 uh it's quite a bit different than uh Texas i don't know if you've ever been outside of Texas but uh
sw2327B-ms98-a-0006 27.704250 38.202125 when i moved to Texas i was told oh well there's no personal income tax well they nail you on property taxes in uh Texas and then that's how they get their money to take care of the schools and things
sw2327B-ms98-a-0007 38.202125 62.374875 [silence]
sw2327B-ms98-a-0008 62.374875 75.557500 yeah i- i found it interesting uh when i moved to Texas the fact that uh the reason people wanted to get their kids into Plano was to go to the Plano school district because_1 it was the best because it had more money than you know other places
sw2327B-ms98-a-0009 75.557500 77.836875 and uh i just um
sw2327B-ms98-a-0010 77.836875 90.728375 in the uh like here in Maryland uh i just bought a uh a house for a hundred and forty one thousand it'd be about sixty thousand down there [laughter] and um
sw2327B-ms98-a-0011 90.728375 97.417000 the tax basis is actually uh less than the full price of the house
sw2327B-ms98-a-0012 97.417000 103.139250 so you end up paying property taxes on what they value the house at i think they only have the house valued at probably about
sw2327B-ms98-a-0013 103.139250 105.943875 [noise] ninety or a hundred thousand dollars
sw2327B-ms98-a-0014 105.943875 113.407125 whereas when i was in Texas i notice that they put the tax basis at at almost the uh full price
sw2327B-ms98-a-0015 113.407125 115.663250 and so there was quite a difference there
sw2327B-ms98-a-0016 115.663250 122.780125 um i think that the way they they levy taxes is a little bit uh
sw2327B-ms98-a-0017 122.780125 131.977375 crazy i think if if they uh people and and i'll use Plano as an example uh house prices in Plano were falling
sw2327B-ms98-a-0018 131.977375 144.671000 and so they decided well in order to get more tax revenue we're going to have to raise the price uh you know we're going to have to raise the uh the the uh tax per hundred dollars of value on the house
sw2327B-ms98-a-0019 144.671000 152.426375 and same time they were approving new starts in homes hand over fist well when you start having a large supply of homes
sw2327B-ms98-a-0020 152.426375 166.593125 then of course the price goes you know the value of the house is going to fall and the existing family homes were the ones that were falling the new homes they were building cheaper and and able to sell cheaper and so people weren't buying the existing family homes so
sw2327B-ms98-a-0021 166.593125 168.549375 they were shooting themselves in the foot
sw2327B-ms98-a-0022 168.549375 175.110875 and you know if they just would have thought well gee if we don't you know if we put a freeze on new home starts
sw2327B-ms98-a-0023 175.110875 186.239125 that will bring the price of houses back up our tax base revenue will go up and we won't have to increase taxes and make it more of a burden on people that are living here
sw2327B-ms98-a-0024 186.239125 192.744000 [silence]
sw2327B-ms98-a-0025 192.744000 196.167125 no no they do have state income tax
sw2327B-ms98-a-0026 196.167125 210.746750 yeah that's and they uh they divide it up by um you know you pay a state income tax and then fifty percent of your state income tax is a county tax which is collected by the state and redistributed to the counties
sw2327B-ms98-a-0027 210.746750 215.922875 [silence]
sw2327B-ms98-a-0028 215.922875 217.711750 that is correct
sw2327B-ms98-a-0029 217.711750 224.959750 [silence]
sw2327B-ms98-a-0030 224.959750 231.862875 um yes i did i only lived in Texas in eighty seven and um eighty eight and uh part of eighty nine
sw2327B-ms98-a-0031 231.862875 235.695375 [silence]
sw2327B-ms98-a-0032 235.695375 237.085375 no
sw2327B-ms98-a-0033 237.085375 240.368500 [silence]
sw2327B-ms98-a-0034 240.368500 242.092500 um
sw2327B-ms98-a-0035 242.092500 249.768750 in Texas i was oh i believe the uh t[ax]- sales tax was somewhere around seven eight eight percent
sw2327B-ms98-a-0036 249.768750 258.879500 here in Maryland it's only five um it was nice to have that uh you know deduction when it was available
sw2327B-ms98-a-0037 258.879500 265.211125 uh but when they revamped the you know supposedly making things more fair um
sw2327B-ms98-a-0038 265.211125 273.500375 i've heard a lot of different arguments uh pro and con about whether we should allow deductions for sales tax or even uh
sw2327B-ms98-a-0039 273.500375 284.470375 maybe we should put more emphasis on sales tax because when you think about it the people that purchase more items are the ones that are better able to pay the taxes
sw2327B-ms98-a-0040 284.470375 291.761125 you know people that are out there barely struggling to pay their uh house payment and buy food aren't going to be out buying you know anything else
sw2327B-ms98-a-0041 291.761125 296.165375 and the the people that you know have the uh disposable income that are 
sw2327B-ms98-a-0042 296.165375 299.771875 probably more able to pay the income tax 
sw2327B-ms98-a-0043 299.771875 309.613625 uh or pay the sales tax are the ones that are really you know have the money and they're out there buying the items maybe they should be you know paying more of the burden um
sw2327B-ms98-a-0044 309.613625 317.048125 there wa[s]- there's another crazy thing that gets me it's like the more children you have the less tax you pay
sw2327B-ms98-a-0045 317.048125 329.644000 and to me that is completely crazy and i have five children so i mean you know i uh i you know it it's kind of odd when i talk about this with other people because it it just doesn't make sense to me you're getting more services
sw2327B-ms98-a-0046 329.644000 343.319750 you know your children are going you know you've got five children in school instead of somebody that only has one or none and so you they're paying more income tax to pay for your children to go to school it just you know doesn't make sense
sw2327B-ms98-a-0047 343.319750 362.119250 [silence]
sw2327B-ms98-a-0048 362.119250 363.378125 um-hum
sw2327B-ms98-a-0049 363.378125 370.033000 [silence]
sw2327B-ms98-a-0050 370.033000 377.187125 yeah now the other side of the question is about are we getting what we're paying for um
sw2327B-ms98-a-0051 377.187125 385.497250 for the most part i think we are but there is a lot of inefficiency uh both on the federal level and on the state level
sw2327B-ms98-a-0052 385.497250 388.062625 and uh hopefully we'll
sw2327B-ms98-a-0053 388.062625 394.807000 you know as we start to go into computerization and all the processes maybe we'll be able to streamline it
sw2327B-ms98-a-0054 394.807000 401.004125 um i haven't kept up with uh the Texas politics other than that dirty little uh governor fight
sw2327B-ms98-a-0055 401.004125 410.651625 but i mean uh we have a a governor here in Maryland who's uh pretty hard nosed and uh he's you know we're three hundred fifty million dollars short
sw2327B-ms98-a-0056 410.651625 416.553625 and every time he comes up with a plan to cut the money everybody starts screaming and yelling
sw2327B-ms98-a-0057 416.553625 430.186750 and uh every time he wants to cut one budget or do something else or try to do something you know they start screaming yelling they won't let him raise the taxes and and they they won't let him cut any programs and he's like what do you guys want me to do
sw2327B-ms98-a-0058 430.186750 432.106375 [laughter-i] [laughter-mean]
sw2327B-ms98-a-0059 432.106375 441.615750 [silence]

sw2327B-ms98-a-0062 463.385125 464.816500 yes

sw2327B-ms98-a-0064 497.828875 499.077125 yeah
sw2327B-ms98-a-0065 499.077125 509.040750 [silence]
sw2327B-ms98-a-0066 509.040750 522.602875 yeah that and i think uh putting more emphasis on local handling of the problem i think this is something that that Bush came out and said in his uh in his address uh to the nation at the beginning of the year
sw2327B-ms98-a-0067 522.602875 527.374250 um you know it used to be that communities would take care of their own
sw2327B-ms98-a-0068 527.374250 533.650375 and that you know the states would take care of the communities and then all of a sudden everybody starting looking to the federal government
sw2327B-ms98-a-0069 533.650375 544.592625 and uh you know once you start up at the top and try to get those dollars on down to the hands that need them you know there's a lot of places the money stops and disappears along the way
sw2327B-ms98-a-0070 544.592625 549.502500 and uh maintenance and overhead and you know and and those kind of costs
sw2327B-ms98-a-0071 549.502500 558.682375 [silence]
sw2327B-ms98-a-0072 558.682375 560.013250 um-hum
