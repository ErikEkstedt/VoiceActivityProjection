sw2327A-ms98-a-0008 37.015375 39.526000 right yeah uh
sw2327A-ms98-a-0009 39.526000 45.428000 as a matter of fact they're talking about changing the the tax situation in Texas because the the schools are not
sw2327A-ms98-a-0010 45.428000 58.769125 they're not equitable within the state so they're changing that they're talking about changing the uh the tax base and how the taxes are distributed to the schools which will probably mean uh another increase in property taxes
sw2327A-ms98-a-0011 58.769125 62.763875 either that or uh starting a state income tax
sw2327A-ms98-a-0012 62.763875 87.597000 [silence]

sw2327A-ms98-a-0031 185.632750 188.023875 yeah guess that's a possibility
sw2327A-ms98-a-0032 188.023875 194.394000 uh as i understand it Maryland does not have any uh state income tax is that right
sw2327A-ms98-a-0033 194.394000 195.519750 [silence]
sw2327A-ms98-a-0034 195.519750 197.501125 oh okay so
sw2327A-ms98-a-0035 197.501125 209.481500 [silence]
sw2327A-ms98-a-0036 209.481500 216.673375 okay then uh all of your state income tax is deductible for federal income tax purposes
sw2327A-ms98-a-0037 216.673375 225.494125 okay did you live in Texas after the uh after they stopped letting you deduct uh sales tax on your tax return
sw2327A-ms98-a-0038 225.494125 231.069375 [silence]
sw2327A-ms98-a-0039 231.069375 236.316875 okay so so you couldn't deduct state inco[me]- uh state sales tax when you lived in Texas
sw2327A-ms98-a-0040 236.316875 240.328500 so what do you think about the difference between those two situations
sw2327A-ms98-a-0041 240.328500 249.223750 [silence]
sw2327A-ms98-a-0042 249.223750 250.291625 um-hum

sw2327A-ms98-a-0050 323.001000 329.231750 [silence]
sw2327A-ms98-a-0051 329.231750 330.807750 um-hum
sw2327A-ms98-a-0052 330.807750 341.906750 [silence]
sw2327A-ms98-a-0053 341.906750 349.740500 yeah that's that's an interesting uh interesting concept i hadn't thought about that how you you you know that that's right i guess [laughter] in a sense
sw2327A-ms98-a-0054 349.740500 360.172000 i guess the you know the idea is that uh the more people you have in the family the more allowances you need you know the more uh capability you need to uh to
sw2327A-ms98-a-0055 360.172000 366.210250 pay for food and clothing and stuff for them so the they give you more allowances more dependent allowances for that
sw2327A-ms98-a-0056 366.210250 370.448500 but uh you know i understand what you're where you're coming from with the
sw2327A-ms98-a-0057 370.448500 388.664250 [silence]
sw2327A-ms98-a-0058 388.664250 389.913625 yeah
sw2327A-ms98-a-0059 389.913625 400.697750 [silence]
sw2327A-ms98-a-0060 400.697750 401.823250 yeah
sw2327A-ms98-a-0061 401.823250 416.037250 [silence]
sw2327A-ms98-a-0062 416.037250 417.285250 um-hum
sw2327A-ms98-a-0063 417.285250 427.506500 [silence]
sw2327A-ms98-a-0064 427.506500 428.660125 right
sw2327A-ms98-a-0065 428.660125 429.673750 [silence]
sw2327A-ms98-a-0066 429.673750 430.671250 [laughter]
sw2327A-ms98-a-0067 430.671250 442.044125 yeah that's i guess uh one thought that occurred to me uh is we're we're talking about having uh national uh military or or public service deal for young people
sw2327A-ms98-a-0068 442.044125 448.276375 maybe a program like that could replace some of the uh welfare programs
sw2327A-ms98-a-0069 448.276375 457.835125 if uh you know if we're going to do that then we ought to really get some benefit dollar benefits out of it that uh to reduce spending in some other areas uh
sw2327A-ms98-a-0070 457.835125 463.871375 you know to do something to eliminate what uh what they refer to as transfer payments
sw2327A-ms98-a-0071 463.871375 476.084125 because uh that's i think that's where our real you know the real problem with government is not is not what the not what the government's doing but where it's spending its money it's it's encouraging people to
sw2327A-ms98-a-0072 476.084125 477.624500 to uh
sw2327A-ms98-a-0073 477.624500 482.666375 not do as well as they can you know uh not have as much output and
sw2327A-ms98-a-0074 482.666375 491.362375 all that you're paying people not to work and you're paying people to have more kids and you know like you said you know more kids you have the more dependents you have you know the allowances you get
sw2327A-ms98-a-0075 491.362375 493.036250 and uh
sw2327A-ms98-a-0076 493.036250 499.924000 the more you have the more uh aid for dependent children you can get and all of these things go into it so
sw2327A-ms98-a-0077 499.924000 509.501000 but uh some kind of a national service uh concept that might be geared around reducing that would be a i think would be a big step so
sw2327A-ms98-a-0078 509.501000 521.856000 [silence]
sw2327A-ms98-a-0079 521.856000 523.204375 right
sw2327A-ms98-a-0080 523.204375 532.390500 [silence]
sw2327A-ms98-a-0081 532.390500 534.209500 right it uh
sw2327A-ms98-a-0082 534.209500 543.883000 [silence]
sw2327A-ms98-a-0083 543.883000 545.170750 right
sw2327A-ms98-a-0084 545.170750 547.560375 [silence]
sw2327A-ms98-a-0085 547.560375 559.207000 yeah right i- i think that a a big part of the uh you know the government concept over the last fifty years has been uh redistribution of uh of wealth in in effect
sw2327A-ms98-a-0086 559.207000 566.365375 uh you know you you tax the people that have the most and the people that don't have anything get it for nothing
sw2327A-ms98-a-0087 566.365375 571.632625 and uh and i don't think that's the American way myself it uh
sw2327A-ms98-a-0088 571.632625 574.694250 it kind of rings of you know socialism and
sw2327A-ms98-a-0089 574.694250 577.743375 and i just i don't understand why
sw2327A-ms98-a-0090 577.743375 582.770000 the American leaders uh seem to think that that's the way to go you know that
sw2327A-ms98-a-0091 582.770000 590.050750 uh there are not i don't think that there are that many people that feel that way that with what they could get support for
sw2327A-ms98-a-0092 590.050750 594.832875 or making the American system work in the way it's originally designed to
sw2327A-ms98-a-0093 594.832875 600.918750 [silence]
