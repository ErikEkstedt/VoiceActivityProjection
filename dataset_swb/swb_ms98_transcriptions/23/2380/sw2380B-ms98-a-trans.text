sw2380B-ms98-a-0003 1.753000 5.862125 well this is kind of ironic because i work in TI's legal department
sw2380B-ms98-a-0004 5.862125 13.241000 and although we don't have any [laughter-criminal] actions here we do have other um lawsuits that do go to trial from time to time
sw2380B-ms98-a-0005 13.241000 21.999875 and uh when was it a couple weeks ago i was asked to go to uh jury duty i i wasn't selected but um
sw2380B-ms98-a-0006 21.999875 30.443250 for some of our cases in particular we have um uh very technical cases from time to time because of like our patents and such 
sw2380B-ms98-a-0007 30.443250 39.734000 and it's very difficult for lay people for somebody who might just you know happen to be selected in our jury to understand what we're talking about
sw2380B-ms98-a-0008 39.734000 46.249250 [silence]
sw2380B-ms98-a-0009 46.249250 47.727250 uh-huh

sw2380B-ms98-a-0015 64.936125 76.463750 yeah you know some instances i don't you always have the option now in criminal i guess you always have a jury but in civil cases you have the option of whether you want a jury or not
sw2380B-ms98-a-0016 76.463750 81.670625 yeah and in some incidences i think they ought to ought not to have a jury um
sw2380B-ms98-a-0017 81.670625 84.181375 [laughter]
sw2380B-ms98-a-0018 84.181375 91.451750 [silence]

sw2380B-ms98-a-0031 144.005375 152.983125 yeah well um i've never fully served i mean i've been asked twice to go down but i didn't get elected on the panel
sw2380B-ms98-a-0032 152.983125 166.250875 but i know that um for a lot of the civil cases it's rare i mean if your a lawyer um there you could be a lawyer who never actually gets into the [laughter-courtroom] there's a lot of attorneys like that that never get to the courtroom
sw2380B-ms98-a-0033 166.250875 176.559250 some their kind of law doesn't get them to the courtroom but even in um litigation which is doing lawsuits is a lot of times that you never get to the courtroom itself and
sw2380B-ms98-a-0034 176.559250 183.815625 [silence]
sw2380B-ms98-a-0035 183.815625 185.179875 yeah

sw2380B-ms98-a-0037 186.567625 188.583000 but it's a shame that
sw2380B-ms98-a-0038 188.583000 199.655375 oh it's not so bad for the court system because the money there isn't being spent but there's awful lot of money in time and effort spent in preparing for trial only to then finally get
sw2380B-ms98-a-0039 199.655375 211.743875 scared enough by going to the court and usually it's the s[care]- it's the scare kind of of the jury because you really don't know one way or the other how that jury is going to feel you could feel that you really have a very strong case 
sw2380B-ms98-a-0040 211.743875 220.441000 and that you're very much right but the jury may or may not see it that way so you get a little antic[ipate]- you know anxious there and go well you know
sw2380B-ms98-a-0041 220.441000 229.145750 i don't feel that sure and who knows what the jury will say because sometimes you know the juries come down with a result and you go gee [laughter] 
sw2380B-ms98-a-0042 229.145750 231.375000 [silence]

sw2380B-ms98-a-0055 305.709875 320.254500 yeah and it seems a lot of times that uh especially in criminals that that their rights are so protected but what about the rights of you know the rest of society i mean we're protecting this person's rights who has broken the law 
sw2380B-ms98-a-0056 320.254500 332.650000 um and we protect him so much but what about the rest of the society you know what are we doing for them we're kind of you know forgetting about them and i think sometimes that a criminal should kind of
sw2380B-ms98-a-0057 332.650000 341.422375 if he breaks law especially it he's a repeater the law shouldn't just always cover for him that some of his rights as should be taken [laughter]

sw2380B-ms98-a-0074 438.463875 447.208625 yeah i'd even go for for trying to get some truth out of the witness stand if they come up with some pretty reliable uh
sw2380B-ms98-a-0075 447.208625 453.348125 um lie detector tests that we can see right then and there whether they're lying or telling the truth 
sw2380B-ms98-a-0076 453.348125 455.150750 [laughter]
sw2380B-ms98-a-0077 455.150750 456.337625 [laughter]
sw2380B-ms98-a-0078 456.337625 458.510750 yeah you know
sw2380B-ms98-a-0079 458.510750 465.654250 yeah i witnessed one trial many years ago when i was first um studying to be a paralegal and uh
sw2380B-ms98-a-0080 465.654250 477.884000 uh they barred priors on this uh person and they never then told us i guess because priors had a reason as to why these two people were very much in hatred of each other
sw2380B-ms98-a-0081 477.884000 488.726500 and they never told us why these two people had such a vendetta against each other and the crime was uh uh attempt to commit murder you know and
sw2380B-ms98-a-0082 488.726500 494.470750 but they never told us why these people were mad at each other and gee you know that's
sw2380B-ms98-a-0083 494.470750 505.249375 yeah you know because they they told us in school that you know crime has to be an intent you know has to be not just the act but you have to intend to do it because there could be accidental kind of things you know
sw2380B-ms98-a-0084 505.249375 515.346750 but they never told us why these two people hated their themselves or if one had done something to you know really aggravate the other there was never any motive 
sw2380B-ms98-a-0085 515.346750 524.754125 given and and i had a tough time with that and and being a person who saw what the jury didn't plus what the jury did because we were just observing you know there in the courtroom
sw2380B-ms98-a-0086 524.754125 532.707875 at the end of it all i still didn't know [laughter] i still have a lot of reasonable doubts and i've seen everything presented
sw2380B-ms98-a-0087 532.707875 539.408000 and you know they just haven't done a real complete case here to my thinking
sw2380B-ms98-a-0088 539.408000 545.135625 i don't know that i want to sit on a jury like that and you'd still you know i want ask some questions
sw2380B-ms98-a-0089 545.135625 547.149000 here [laughter]
