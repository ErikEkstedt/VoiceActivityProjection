sw2380A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 5.029625 [silence]
sw2380A-ms98-a-0002 5.029625 6.922000 do you
sw2380A-ms98-a-0003 6.922000 12.469125 [silence]
sw2380A-ms98-a-0004 12.469125 13.861750 uh-huh
sw2380A-ms98-a-0005 13.861750 29.253625 [silence]
sw2380A-ms98-a-0006 29.253625 31.189625 sure
sw2380A-ms98-a-0007 31.189625 39.005750 [silence]
sw2380A-ms98-a-0008 39.005750 49.945000 well i do think that the cases like the uh oh say something like Texaco versus Pennzoil or or the Texaco Pennzoil problem
sw2380A-ms98-a-0009 49.945000 63.010125 uh is ridiculous for people just taken off the street to understand and really should have some better way where people who understand both the circumstances and the complex issues involved
sw2380A-ms98-a-0010 63.010125 65.493000 should handle cases like that
sw2380A-ms98-a-0011 65.493000 75.574875 [silence]
sw2380A-ms98-a-0012 75.574875 77.228125 oh is that right
sw2380A-ms98-a-0013 77.228125 80.654625 [silence]
sw2380A-ms98-a-0014 80.654625 88.558000 yeah oh boy or uh or there should be some way where it could be opted for them not to have a jury
sw2380A-ms98-a-0015 88.558000 102.024500 uh i was only on one jury ever so far in my life and uh it really was a pretty trivial case and it seemed to me all the time i was thinking of all these people in the courtroom over this
sw2380A-ms98-a-0016 102.024500 107.624750 case that involved oh a couple thousand dollars i think it was it was 
sw2380A-ms98-a-0017 107.624750 112.974000 really just uh uh terrific waste of everybody's time and money
sw2380A-ms98-a-0018 112.974000 121.335750 and it finally ended up that uh even though we had reached a verdict before we were allowed to give it they settled the case
sw2380A-ms98-a-0019 121.335750 125.161125 they wou[ld]- they had settled while we were deliberating
sw2380A-ms98-a-0020 125.161125 131.790375 now the one thing i did approve of there was that we didn't have to be unanimous because it was a civil case
sw2380A-ms98-a-0021 131.790375 144.580875 and uh we were split uh ten to two so it was uh a good thing that [laughter] it wasn't a total waste of time to have a hung jury on a case that trivial
sw2380A-ms98-a-0022 144.580875 163.090250 [silence]
sw2380A-ms98-a-0023 163.090250 164.559250 uh-huh
sw2380A-ms98-a-0024 164.559250 175.349625 [silence]
sw2380A-ms98-a-0025 175.349625 186.815625 well i think that the trial in a sense is kind of a threat to hold over people to try to get them to reach an agreement out of court because it does cost so much money
sw2380A-ms98-a-0026 186.815625 207.807875 [silence]
sw2380A-ms98-a-0027 207.807875 209.354625 uh-huh
sw2380A-ms98-a-0028 209.354625 215.926875 [silence]
sw2380A-ms98-a-0029 215.926875 216.934875 sure
sw2380A-ms98-a-0030 216.934875 219.815250 [silence]
sw2380A-ms98-a-0031 219.815250 221.003000 yeah
sw2380A-ms98-a-0032 221.003000 227.815750 [silence]
sw2380A-ms98-a-0033 227.815750 241.894125 yeah i was a witness in a case in a criminal case and it was absolutely horrifying to me how that operated because so much evidence was excluded
sw2380A-ms98-a-0034 241.894125 247.409625 and that the jury was never allowed to hear and they convicted the defendant
sw2380A-ms98-a-0035 247.409625 254.707625 ah on as far as i could tell very flimsy evidence and two perjured testimonies 
sw2380A-ms98-a-0036 254.707625 262.107875 and i knew the people involved both the people who perjured and the people who uh were defendants
sw2380A-ms98-a-0037 262.107875 275.677125 and yeah i think that was just a a horrible miscarriage of justice because of the uh you know staying by the absolute strict rules and not allowing things to be presented to the jury
sw2380A-ms98-a-0038 275.677125 282.438500 that uh were highly relevant to the case and could i thought have established the defendant's innocence
sw2380A-ms98-a-0039 282.438500 294.469875 so uh i do although i'm a lawyer's daughter and i have lawyer's and judges on both sides of the family and uncles and cousins and things like that i really
sw2380A-ms98-a-0040 294.469875 306.563750 think that we have gotten into much too legalistic of society and that we we spend far too much on the fine points of the law and far too little on achieving justice
sw2380A-ms98-a-0041 306.563750 319.490250 [silence]
sw2380A-ms98-a-0042 319.490250 320.951375 uh-huh
sw2380A-ms98-a-0043 320.951375 337.969625 [silence]
sw2380A-ms98-a-0044 337.969625 340.496625 well and then in a lot of
sw2380A-ms98-a-0045 340.496625 349.522000 yeah in criminal cases uh for instance you can't bring up prior convictions unless they are somehow directly related to the case
sw2380A-ms98-a-0046 349.522000 357.887500 and it seems to me that a jury can make a much more rational decision if they know somebody had fifteen convictions for a similar crime
sw2380A-ms98-a-0047 357.887500 364.116500 yeah and now it's possible that he didn't commit this one but the [laughter-likelihood] is certainly [laughter-tilted]
sw2380A-ms98-a-0048 364.116500 377.442750 with a record like that and uh that was one of the things that we're not allowed to was not allowed in the uh trial i went to though uh one of the two people who gave the perjured testimony
sw2380A-ms98-a-0049 377.442750 382.807875 had a long criminal record and had been you know a real sleaze bag
sw2380A-ms98-a-0050 382.807875 385.182750 and he came in
sw2380A-ms98-a-0051 385.182750 394.893375 and was presented to the court as a fine upstanding young man who had uh been in seminary to become a priest and yeah
sw2380A-ms98-a-0052 394.893375 405.352875 you would have thought the guy was just pure as the driven snow but i happen to know his background and i know that he would have sold out his mother for uh uh shorter sentence
sw2380A-ms98-a-0053 405.352875 414.921125 and you know it's it's really annoying when the i asked the defense attorney later why he didn't bring up all this other trouble the guy had been in
sw2380A-ms98-a-0054 414.921125 419.738750 he said that that was barred uh by the court
sw2380A-ms98-a-0055 419.738750 421.497250 so
sw2380A-ms98-a-0056 421.497250 433.473250 we do have some problems and it seems to me that uh maybe it's time to just scrap all the case law and go back to general [laughter-principles] and start over
sw2380A-ms98-a-0057 433.473250 439.918625 and then make a legal system that carefully protects people but uh where
sw2380A-ms98-a-0058 439.918625 452.475500 [silence]
sw2380A-ms98-a-0059 452.475500 453.737125 yeah
sw2380A-ms98-a-0060 453.737125 456.022125 yeah that would be helpful
sw2380A-ms98-a-0061 456.022125 457.060000 [silence]
sw2380A-ms98-a-0062 457.060000 458.472125 sure would
sw2380A-ms98-a-0063 458.472125 476.865125 [silence]
sw2380A-ms98-a-0064 476.865125 478.206875 um
sw2380A-ms98-a-0065 478.206875 487.776875 [silence]
sw2380A-ms98-a-0066 487.776875 488.992125 um
sw2380A-ms98-a-0067 488.992125 492.874750 [silence]
sw2380A-ms98-a-0068 492.874750 495.630000 and you think that would be relevant
sw2380A-ms98-a-0069 495.630000 504.220000 [silence]
sw2380A-ms98-a-0070 504.220000 505.620875 right
sw2380A-ms98-a-0071 505.620875 514.733625 [silence]
sw2380A-ms98-a-0072 514.733625 516.187375 uh-huh
sw2380A-ms98-a-0073 516.187375 523.962875 [silence]
sw2380A-ms98-a-0074 523.962875 524.995625 uh-huh
sw2380A-ms98-a-0075 524.995625 526.980000 [silence]
sw2380A-ms98-a-0076 526.980000 529.065125 yeah right
sw2380A-ms98-a-0077 529.065125 538.535000 [silence]
sw2380A-ms98-a-0078 538.535000 541.723250 uh-huh i think so and uh and
sw2380A-ms98-a-0079 541.723250 545.161500 [silence]
sw2380A-ms98-a-0080 545.161500 553.220500 yeah that's something i thought would be a very good idea of when juries come in they are told just to shut up and listen
sw2380A-ms98-a-0081 553.220500 566.552875 and it seems to me that you'd get a lot more uh information if your questions were heard if you were allowed to ask the witnesses things or if or the lawyers things or even the judge
sw2380A-ms98-a-0082 566.552875 568.670000 but particularly the witnesses
sw2380A-ms98-a-0083 568.670000 581.670250 [silence]
sw2380A-ms98-a-0084 581.670250 596.046500 or if they would allow them to uh give broader answers they it's really kind of uh choreographed it's like a script has been written when people testify they aren't testifying really in their own words
sw2380A-ms98-a-0085 596.046500 598.590750 yeah i can remember uh 
sw2380A-ms98-a-0086 598.590750 599.853000 friends of daddy
