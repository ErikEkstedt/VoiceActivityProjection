sw2330A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.049000 [noise] 
sw2330A-ms98-a-0002 0.049000 1.627875 there we go 
sw2330A-ms98-a-0003 1.627875 10.073250 [silence]
sw2330A-ms98-a-0004 10.073250 11.962125 [noise] i think that's true
sw2330A-ms98-a-0005 11.962125 16.217250 the uh the Bermuda grass is greening up
sw2330A-ms98-a-0006 16.217250 21.835125 uh in in March it sometimes doesn't really start doing that until the first part of April so
sw2330A-ms98-a-0007 21.835125 24.895000 so i think we're a little -[a]head uh ahead of schedule on that
sw2330A-ms98-a-0008 24.895000 33.755375 [silence]
sw2330A-ms98-a-0009 33.755375 38.953625 that's true it's been a [noise] a fun break but it the break is over
sw2330A-ms98-a-0010 38.953625 50.315000 [silence]
sw2330A-ms98-a-0011 50.315000 53.760500 yeah now the last couple of weekends have been nice and sunny
sw2330A-ms98-a-0012 53.760500 59.071375 [silence]
sw2330A-ms98-a-0013 59.071375 66.347250 well yeah but i'd rather have a sunny weekend than a gray weekend so
sw2330A-ms98-a-0014 66.347250 67.839375 yeah
sw2330A-ms98-a-0015 67.839375 74.569875 [silence]
sw2330A-ms98-a-0016 74.569875 75.941625 yeah
sw2330A-ms98-a-0017 75.941625 78.825375 [noise] i hadn't heard whether it's gonna rain or not
sw2330A-ms98-a-0018 78.825375 88.231000 [silence]
sw2330A-ms98-a-0019 88.231000 89.890250 well that's good
sw2330A-ms98-a-0020 89.890250 97.054125 [silence]
sw2330A-ms98-a-0021 97.054125 106.632875 yeah that's probably a [vocalized-noise] a little bit under what it is for this time of year i- i think i haven't seen the weath[er]- the n[ews]- the weather
sw2330A-ms98-a-0022 106.632875 112.596125 on the news in the evening lately but i think the average high would be it should be about seventy
sw2330A-ms98-a-0023 112.596125 114.563000 [silence]
sw2330A-ms98-a-0024 114.563000 115.975625 yeah
sw2330A-ms98-a-0025 115.975625 134.710500 [silence]
sw2330A-ms98-a-0026 134.710500 137.958750 yeah that's true
sw2330A-ms98-a-0027 137.958750 139.144750 um
sw2330A-ms98-a-0028 139.144750 146.353000 [noise] one of the remarkable things about the weather in the summertime here is that quite often the average daytime high
sw2330A-ms98-a-0029 146.353000 152.999875 of say ninety nine degrees is within five or six degrees of the all time record high
sw2330A-ms98-a-0030 152.999875 157.445250 and what that tells me is that the summer weather is very predictable
sw2330A-ms98-a-0031 157.445250 160.067250 that it doesn't vary very much
sw2330A-ms98-a-0032 160.067250 161.080750 [silence]
sw2330A-ms98-a-0033 161.080750 166.618875 y[eah]- i mean any other time of year that's not the case because_1 it could be very warm or very cold
sw2330A-ms98-a-0034 166.618875 173.985500 [silence]
sw2330A-ms98-a-0035 173.985500 175.487500 uh-huh
sw2330A-ms98-a-0036 175.487500 179.195000 [silence]
sw2330A-ms98-a-0037 179.195000 180.858500 right
sw2330A-ms98-a-0038 180.858500 182.416000 right
sw2330A-ms98-a-0039 182.416000 186.089250 [silence]
sw2330A-ms98-a-0040 186.089250 191.986250 yeah [noise] one of the weirdest things i saw i think it was around this time last year
sw2330A-ms98-a-0041 191.986250 195.453250 [noise] was a twenty six degree lightning storm
sw2330A-ms98-a-0042 195.453250 196.826625 [silence]
sw2330A-ms98-a-0043 196.826625 205.643000 [noise] i you know i was going into the grocery store and a [noise] a lightning bolt was almost directly overhead and it was twenty six degrees out
sw2330A-ms98-a-0044 205.643000 210.781625 and i thought well gee i've i've never known it to lightning at that temperature
sw2330A-ms98-a-0045 210.781625 215.727875 [silence]
sw2330A-ms98-a-0046 215.727875 220.128750 that's right it uh it probably was a lot warmer up high
sw2330A-ms98-a-0047 220.128750 224.191000 sometimes they get those inversions like when we had that
sw2330A-ms98-a-0048 224.191000 230.295500 twelve and a half days a few years ago that it never got up as high as freezing
sw2330A-ms98-a-0049 230.295500 233.761875 the air temperature at five thousand feet was fifty degrees
sw2330A-ms98-a-0050 233.761875 237.954000 because_1 the cold weather was just simply trapped along the ground and couldn't get away
sw2330A-ms98-a-0051 237.954000 243.485875 [silence]
sw2330A-ms98-a-0052 243.485875 244.752750 nope
sw2330A-ms98-a-0053 244.752750 249.236625 [silence]

sw2330A-ms98-a-0056 254.903625 257.002625 [noise] well this has been interesting
sw2330A-ms98-a-0057 257.002625 259.557625 n[ot]- not too challenging to the brain
sw2330A-ms98-a-0058 259.557625 262.003375 [silence]
sw2330A-ms98-a-0059 262.003375 263.470250 nope
sw2330A-ms98-a-0060 263.470250 265.902875 [noise] all right Ellen well you have a good day
