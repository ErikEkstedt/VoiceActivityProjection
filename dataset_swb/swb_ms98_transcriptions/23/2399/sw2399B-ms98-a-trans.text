sw2399B-ms98-a-0006 18.090000 20.148625 for a number of reasons
sw2399B-ms98-a-0007 20.148625 24.156750 one of which is the you know extreme interest rate on most of them
sw2399B-ms98-a-0008 24.156750 32.727375 the one i use uh of course for mostly only for business purposes is uh you know American Express

sw2399B-ms98-a-0019 53.005375 63.992375 to the tune of somewhere on the order of five to ten billion i believe is number uh at least that's one number for this range of numbers i have i have heard

sw2399B-ms98-a-0049 184.462750 186.691625 i felt i would spend
sw2399B-ms98-a-0050 186.691625 189.430000 and then use it then
sw2399B-ms98-a-0051 189.430000 190.434500 [silence]
sw2399B-ms98-a-0052 190.434500 195.007625 but uh you know for hotels and and so forth but uh

sw2399B-ms98-a-0062 227.101875 231.109000 well i found you know i found in um
sw2399B-ms98-a-0063 231.109000 233.360125 in traveling overseas
sw2399B-ms98-a-0064 233.360125 235.838125 that uh
sw2399B-ms98-a-0065 235.838125 236.877750 [silence]
sw2399B-ms98-a-0066 236.877750 238.167625 often
sw2399B-ms98-a-0067 238.167625 239.174375 [silence]
sw2399B-ms98-a-0068 239.174375 244.818250 it would uh it would expedite things to have an American Express credit card
sw2399B-ms98-a-0069 244.818250 245.839750 [silence]
sw2399B-ms98-a-0070 245.839750 249.403625 for uh for hotel bills and so forth
sw2399B-ms98-a-0071 249.403625 251.378500 plus i would uh
sw2399B-ms98-a-0072 251.378500 252.383125 [silence]
sw2399B-ms98-a-0073 252.383125 253.835500 when they
sw2399B-ms98-a-0074 253.835500 255.276125 uh
sw2399B-ms98-a-0075 255.276125 259.417125 would send the bill and they would automatically convert
sw2399B-ms98-a-0076 259.417125 261.256875 to the
sw2399B-ms98-a-0077 261.256875 263.029625 exchange rate
sw2399B-ms98-a-0078 263.029625 264.081750 [silence]
sw2399B-ms98-a-0079 264.081750 265.357750 so
sw2399B-ms98-a-0080 265.357750 272.585625 now the only t[ime]- time that got to be a problem was if the exchange rate changed drastically
sw2399B-ms98-a-0081 272.585625 273.586125 [silence]
sw2399B-ms98-a-0082 273.586125 277.090875 uh for example i remember on one trip to France
sw2399B-ms98-a-0083 277.090875 278.119375 [silence]
sw2399B-ms98-a-0084 278.119375 280.702000 when i started planning the trip
sw2399B-ms98-a-0085 280.702000 282.435375 i think uh
sw2399B-ms98-a-0086 282.435375 283.437500 [silence]
sw2399B-ms98-a-0087 283.437500 286.349000 a dollar was worth nine or ten francs
sw2399B-ms98-a-0088 286.349000 287.351250 [silence]
sw2399B-ms98-a-0089 287.351250 291.377250 and just in a matter of a week or two
sw2399B-ms98-a-0090 291.377250 292.379625 [silence]
sw2399B-ms98-a-0091 292.379625 298.073375 the dollar fell against the franc drastically and whe[n]- when i finally got over there
sw2399B-ms98-a-0092 298.073375 302.810875 it had fallen uh two or three francs to the dollar so the
sw2399B-ms98-a-0093 302.810875 304.863375 [laughter] so
sw2399B-ms98-a-0094 304.863375 308.666875 i got caught a little short in that regard but uh
sw2399B-ms98-a-0095 308.666875 309.682000 [silence]
sw2399B-ms98-a-0096 309.682000 313.575375 uh i i was anticipating you know my room would cost uh
sw2399B-ms98-a-0097 313.575375 315.102250 let's say if it were
sw2399B-ms98-a-0098 315.102250 317.895750 say sixty or seventy francs a night
sw2399B-ms98-a-0099 317.895750 321.272000 that would mean it would be about ten dollars or so
sw2399B-ms98-a-0100 321.272000 325.375500 or maybe twenty doll[ars]- maybe it would be more than that it was more than [vocalized-noise]
sw2399B-ms98-a-0101 325.375500 329.136000 it would average out to thirty five or forty dollars a night which is a reasonable rate
sw2399B-ms98-a-0102 329.136000 330.841625 but then [laughter]
sw2399B-ms98-a-0103 330.841625 335.038625 when i got back and i was working for the government at the time
sw2399B-ms98-a-0104 335.038625 343.575250 uh of course the government was several months behind on their per on its per diem for exchange rate
sw2399B-ms98-a-0105 343.575250 351.885000 so there's a little consternation you know in trying to uh get them to compensate for the uh for the difference in the exchange rate
sw2399B-ms98-a-0106 351.885000 353.533125 [laughter]
sw2399B-ms98-a-0107 353.533125 356.778500 that that was the only time i really got caught short and i
sw2399B-ms98-a-0108 356.778500 357.796500 [silence]
sw2399B-ms98-a-0109 357.796500 364.627500 but as i said most most of all i try not to use them uh to any you know lavishly in that regard
sw2399B-ms98-a-0110 364.627500 367.075750 and it yeah yeah
sw2399B-ms98-a-0111 367.075750 369.198000 well from where are you calling
