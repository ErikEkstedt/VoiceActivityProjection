sw2397A-ms98-a-0073 354.301625 360.267375 um i guess because i i went back to school so i don't have as much time

sw2397A-ms98-a-0084 417.549250 421.133000 and you know i've i have worked on it quite a bit but
sw2397A-ms98-a-0085 421.133000 425.582625 not as much as i'd like to you know it's just so hard
sw2397A-ms98-a-0086 425.582625 439.311375 uh-huh uh well i shouldn't it's counted cross stitch actually is what i'm doing and so it's really since it's counted you know it's really a lot of work [laughter] yep

sw2397A-ms98-a-0096 477.634500 488.738000 no that's true i i just don't know when i'm ever it just seems like there's just never enough time to to pick it up and do it you know it's just really hard
sw2397A-ms98-a-0097 488.738000 495.051250 but i really do en[joy]- like i said i really enjoy it when i do [laughter] it's just hard 
sw2397A-ms98-a-0098 495.051250 500.506000 uh-huh and there's there's so many other things that i
sw2397A-ms98-a-0099 500.506000 505.932250 i have done you know in the meantime like i said so many baby gifts i've made a lot of bibs
sw2397A-ms98-a-0100 505.932250 507.809125 and wall hangings
sw2397A-ms98-a-0101 507.809125 513.334750 and so you know those don't take much time at all so it's no big deal for me to pick those up
sw2397A-ms98-a-0102 513.334750 515.118250 and do them
sw2397A-ms98-a-0103 515.118250 520.262375 [silence]

sw2397A-ms98-a-0106 527.317500 531.654875 and then i buy the bibs separate usually i think it's
sw2397A-ms98-a-0107 531.654875 544.353750 a little bit cheaper in the long run and then i just use whatever colors i want to i don't usually use the colors they tell me to and it it depends on what it is you know but some things especially letters
sw2397A-ms98-a-0108 544.353750 552.064250 if they suggest certain colors for letters i just go with whatever i want to yeah i yeah
sw2397A-ms98-a-0109 552.064250 553.900625 yeah
sw2397A-ms98-a-0110 553.900625 566.989625 there's yeah there's a a few designs i guess i've done myself but not very many [laughter] real simple ones you know i do i've made i made a little uh
sw2397A-ms98-a-0111 566.989625 571.832625 uh little uh little thumb print and made it a bunny
sw2397A-ms98-a-0112 571.832625 575.074500 it was really easy i mean just
sw2397A-ms98-a-0113 575.074500 578.017250 just did a thumb print you know
sw2397A-ms98-a-0114 578.017250 579.251375 [silence]

sw2397A-ms98-a-0116 580.496375 594.106125 and then see i didn't cross stitch the actual thumb print you know that was just the ink and then i made the ears and little eyes and nose and mouth that was so simple [laughter-and] [laughter-it] ju[st]- it didn't take anything at all and
sw2397A-ms98-a-0117 594.106125 595.441625 [silence]
sw2397A-ms98-a-0118 595.441625 596.762625 uh-huh
