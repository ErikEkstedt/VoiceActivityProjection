sw2397B-ms98-a-0021 100.239125 107.090125 needlework using using the uh i started to say the canvas but the
sw2397B-ms98-a-0022 107.090125 109.012625 uh hum the
sw2397B-ms98-a-0023 109.012625 121.022500 what what kind of cloth uses that i i've just gone blank but it's used wi[th]- uh with yarn and it usually takes long stitches over two or three openings in the cloth
sw2397B-ms98-a-0024 121.022500 131.656375 and you weave intricate patterns and use different colors like it could be a flame stitch where so rather than drawing a picture you're making a design like a geometric or
sw2397B-ms98-a-0025 131.656375 137.088750 whatever and it was used quite often in the colonial times to
sw2397B-ms98-a-0026 137.088750 145.916625 uh uh to upholster chairs and so forth as well as the crewel um embroidery work that was done on them

sw2397B-ms98-a-0030 164.449875 168.762000 or or what and it i was so proud of them when i got them finished
sw2397B-ms98-a-0031 168.762000 171.336750 but i have no idea where they are
sw2397B-ms98-a-0032 171.336750 176.877625 bargello it's B A R G E double L O

sw2397B-ms98-a-0037 210.326125 215.688125 how did you know to choose this subject tonight that's funny uh
sw2397B-ms98-a-0038 215.688125 223.285250 uh what how did you what kinds of decorations did you use with the bas[kets]- how were you decorating the baskets
sw2397B-ms98-a-0039 223.285250 225.164500 um
sw2397B-ms98-a-0040 225.164500 236.018500 [silence]
sw2397B-ms98-a-0041 236.018500 240.563500 like fabric that's been stiffened in yes
sw2397B-ms98-a-0042 240.563500 244.380625 [silence]
sw2397B-ms98-a-0043 244.380625 257.787000 i've seen some and there there they i suspect they're fairly simple because the one lady i've seen i know that does it i've never asked her any questions but she has three kids all under the age of like six
sw2397B-ms98-a-0044 257.787000 264.430250 and and they're all a handful so it's got to be something she can do fairly easily and fairly quickly
sw2397B-ms98-a-0045 264.430250 272.266375 when i do um crochet it's it's usually the the lacy Victorian type
sw2397B-ms98-a-0046 272.266375 278.432250 things like that and i stiffen those with a a glue mixture it's like white glue
sw2397B-ms98-a-0047 278.432250 283.586375 and it may be something similar to that that the fabric is dipped in and then
sw2397B-ms98-a-0048 283.586375 296.753500 um allowed to dry in those those draping bows i mean those draping streamers i don't know i was just there's bound to be some kind of fabric stiffener like that that's very similar that's not going to melt too much with uh
sw2397B-ms98-a-0049 296.753500 298.595375 uh high humidity
sw2397B-ms98-a-0050 298.595375 299.973000 in in a room

sw2397B-ms98-a-0054 318.845500 331.240625 uh quilted uh uh hanging it's like it's a flag and i don't want to wash it because that would start breaking down the batting and so forth but it's such a dust collector to be
sw2397B-ms98-a-0055 331.240625 342.658125 out and so forth and most of my things are dust collectors [laughter] uh and i hate to dust so that's the first thing i think of is how easy would this thing be to clean [laughter]
sw2397B-ms98-a-0056 342.658125 357.343000 [silence]
sw2397B-ms98-a-0057 357.343000 360.307000 oh you don't have time

sw2397B-ms98-a-0073 445.654625 447.735875 and so i've got to have
sw2397B-ms98-a-0074 447.735875 460.925500 total almost total silence i can't really watch television if the pattern is very intricate it sounds like you'd have lots of shading on that particular piece it is not does not sound like an easy one to finish
