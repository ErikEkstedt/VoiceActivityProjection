sw2398B-ms98-a-0003 2.602500 9.901000 well as a matter of fact i just got rid of a car [laughter] because of the requirement to do some major repairs
sw2398B-ms98-a-0004 9.901000 18.651500 um i had a Ford Escort with about ninety five thousand miles on it and the engine was shot um
sw2398B-ms98-a-0005 18.651500 24.892750 i i think the problem was uh the head gasket needed to be replaced
sw2398B-ms98-a-0006 24.892750 26.888250 and um
sw2398B-ms98-a-0007 26.888250 33.195250 but nobody would do just the head gasket everybody wanted to overhaul the engine entirely
sw2398B-ms98-a-0008 33.195250 34.517875 [silence]
sw2398B-ms98-a-0009 34.517875 36.855375 right and um
sw2398B-ms98-a-0010 36.855375 38.344625 um
sw2398B-ms98-a-0011 38.344625 48.125500 i did get the water pump was shot at the same time so i got the water pump fixed just to carry me over until i could sell the car um
sw2398B-ms98-a-0012 48.125500 61.589000 which i which surprisingly the car was in great demand um in fact i had a bunch of people come to look at it and they were fighting over how much they were going to pay me for this piece of junk i was amazed
sw2398B-ms98-a-0013 61.589000 63.103750 [silence]
sw2398B-ms98-a-0014 63.103750 75.930875 i guess so um bu[t]- i ended up buying a um a used car to replace it i got a uh eighty five Dodge Aries which only had thirty four thousand miles on it
sw2398B-ms98-a-0015 75.930875 86.971250 and uh speaking of repair problems um this car has a has an interesting problem that nobody seems to be able to fix do do you fix cars

sw2398B-ms98-a-0042 153.153750 155.850875 yeah what now what state are you in
sw2398B-ms98-a-0043 155.850875 157.401125 Texas you're in Texas so am i
sw2398B-ms98-a-0044 157.401125 170.499000 um yeah the the problem i have with this Dodge uh this Dodge Aries is that if i drive the car for reasonable period of time enough to get the car heated up
sw2398B-ms98-a-0045 170.499000 175.852250 and then i run t[o]- run out to do a quick errand and jump back into the car it won't start
sw2398B-ms98-a-0046 175.852250 178.801125 and it won't start until the car is cooled off
sw2398B-ms98-a-0047 178.801125 180.043125 i've learned that
sw2398B-ms98-a-0048 180.043125 182.987250 and as soon as it coo[ls]- cools off it'll start right up 
sw2398B-ms98-a-0049 182.987250 185.481500 [silence]
sw2398B-ms98-a-0050 185.481500 187.236750 what was the problem
sw2398B-ms98-a-0051 187.236750 188.320500 [silence]
sw2398B-ms98-a-0052 188.320500 189.897875 oh [laughter]

sw2398B-ms98-a-0054 190.904500 191.866250 yeah
sw2398B-ms98-a-0055 191.866250 192.878375 [silence]
sw2398B-ms98-a-0056 192.878375 195.202625 yeah somebody said that um
sw2398B-ms98-a-0057 195.202625 200.076750 that uh there mus[t]- there's probably some kind of short in the starter
sw2398B-ms98-a-0058 200.076750 206.932500 and that when the car heats up it uh the metal expands to create the short
sw2398B-ms98-a-0059 206.932500 221.036875 and then i[t]- i[t]- it isn't until the car cools down that the metal you know these two pieces aren't touching any more and and uh and your you you know then it'll start because you don't have the short
sw2398B-ms98-a-0060 221.036875 235.190000 but i've taken it to a mechanic and and he started to look at it in fact i drove it out there and i said i bet you anything if you go try start the car right now you won't be able to start it sure enough he couldn't and they had to push it into the garage
sw2398B-ms98-a-0061 235.190000 247.030250 but they started uh tracing the wires back to see if they could find any shorts or anything and after they fiddled with the wires the problem didn't uh didn't re[cur]- recur
sw2398B-ms98-a-0062 247.030250 249.105625 they couldn't get it to fail
sw2398B-ms98-a-0063 249.105625 255.308250 and sure enough after i'd taken it home for you know a couple of weeks after that i didn't have the problem
sw2398B-ms98-a-0064 255.308250 257.996125 but now it's starting to recur again
sw2398B-ms98-a-0065 257.996125 266.725625 so it's just one of those weird things i mean he was will[ing]- he said well i think it's in the ignition switch it'll only cost you eighty five dollars but i won't guarantee that's the problem 
sw2398B-ms98-a-0066 266.725625 274.039500 uh yeah and i'm going we[ll]- we[ll]- i don't want to gamble so i just let the car cool off until i get a hard failure
sw2398B-ms98-a-0067 274.039500 275.259250 and then uh
sw2398B-ms98-a-0068 275.259250 276.474125 [silence]
sw2398B-ms98-a-0069 276.474125 277.570375 yeah

sw2398B-ms98-a-0071 279.171875 283.145750 well that's that's that's reassuring i've never had a Dodge before
sw2398B-ms98-a-0072 283.145750 288.889750 and i mean it seems like a nice little car it's a great deal it only had thirty four thousand miles on it
sw2398B-ms98-a-0073 288.889750 291.697125 and otherwise it doesn't give me any problems at all
sw2398B-ms98-a-0074 291.697125 295.050875 you won't [laughter] oh yeah
sw2398B-ms98-a-0075 295.050875 296.134375 yeah

sw2398B-ms98-a-0079 302.351875 304.189250 [silence]
sw2398B-ms98-a-0080 304.189250 316.678250 [laughter] i've you know i've actually had a lot of luck with Fords um um i'm not gonna i'm not gonna sit here and claim that they're the best cars in the world but 
sw2398B-ms98-a-0081 316.678250 323.922250 yeah i mean this this Escort even when the head gasket went i mean it would start first time every time
sw2398B-ms98-a-0082 323.922250 325.372625 and uh
sw2398B-ms98-a-0083 325.372625 333.544375 uh so i['ve]- i've just been real pleased and my step father happens to work at a Ford dealership and that makes things a little easier come car time but
sw2398B-ms98-a-0084 333.544375 339.146250 [silence]

sw2398B-ms98-a-0089 345.811375 353.917375 [laughter] i just uh i was just talking to somebody who'd had a some kind of i think he had a Cutlass
sw2398B-ms98-a-0090 353.917375 359.923750 and he had a hundred and ninety five thousand miles on it and fin[ally]- the thing finally went
sw2398B-ms98-a-0091 359.923750 363.613250 so he goes out and he buys a Lexus
sw2398B-ms98-a-0092 363.613250 369.495750 and i'm going whoa [laughter] he he moved up [laughter]
sw2398B-ms98-a-0093 369.495750 376.312875 yeah i mean you know he's single he's approaching fifty years old
sw2398B-ms98-a-0094 376.312875 380.852375 he doesn't really have anything else to spend his money on [laughter]
sw2398B-ms98-a-0095 380.852375 387.070375 so but uh i can['t]- i just can't imagine i mean are those cars worth thirty or forty thousand dollars
sw2398B-ms98-a-0096 387.070375 394.489125 [silence]
sw2398B-ms98-a-0097 394.489125 395.419125 really 
sw2398B-ms98-a-0098 395.419125 405.140875 well it's funny because talk about car repairs i was getting my oil changed and i was sitting in the little lobby it's one of these you know five minute change places
sw2398B-ms98-a-0099 405.140875 409.220375 and this guy comes storming into the lobby there and he says um
sw2398B-ms98-a-0100 409.220375 414.857750 you know you guys advertise a twenty dollar oil change and you charged me thirty dollars
sw2398B-ms98-a-0101 414.857750 421.291375 and the guy says well yeah but you got a Mercedes Benz and it takes a special oil filter
sw2398B-ms98-a-0102 421.291375 428.075875 and the guy was oh yeah he's almost proud that he had to pay an extra ten bucks to get his oil changed i'm going
sw2398B-ms98-a-0103 428.075875 437.383000 i don't think that's worth it [laughter] i don't think spending an extra you know twenty thousand dollars for a car is worth it you know i don't know
sw2398B-ms98-a-0104 437.383000 439.485125 [silence]
sw2398B-ms98-a-0105 439.485125 441.397875 yeah oh yeah

sw2398B-ms98-a-0114 463.685875 472.641625 i couldn't i tried to do that with my Escort but there's no way to change to get that oil filter out without that i could figure out without getting underneath the car 
sw2398B-ms98-a-0115 472.641625 474.247375 [silence]

sw2398B-ms98-a-0120 484.415000 495.295125 oh yeah i'd prefer to do it but the Escort was very difficult for me to get under and i didn't want to put it up on ramps or anything it just made me nervous
sw2398B-ms98-a-0121 495.295125 498.191750 i mean can you crawl underneath there or is it
sw2398B-ms98-a-0122 498.191750 502.529500 [silence]
sw2398B-ms98-a-0123 502.529500 503.671875 hum

sw2398B-ms98-a-0127 508.849875 513.580625 i think this uh the the Dodge would be pretty easy to change the oil on i think
sw2398B-ms98-a-0128 513.580625 518.240000 at least i'm going to give it a try cause you can s[ee]- i mean the oil filters i mean you can touch it it's right there

sw2398B-ms98-a-0135 532.723000 537.888500 well i i you know it's just a that's the biggest hassle
sw2398B-ms98-a-0136 537.888500 548.938000 i think that if i had been nicer to my Escort and been more diligent about getting the oil changes and doing that kind of stuff i could have probably gotten another ten thousand miles out of it
