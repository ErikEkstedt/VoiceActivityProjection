sw2374A-ms98-a-0002 0.500125 2.541250 well who's the team
sw2374A-ms98-a-0003 2.541250 6.944375 [silence]
sw2374A-ms98-a-0004 6.944375 11.301375 oh really well i i'm picking Duke because_1 uh they just won it
sw2374A-ms98-a-0005 11.301375 13.509125 [silence]
sw2374A-ms98-a-0006 13.509125 14.654500 yeah
sw2374A-ms98-a-0007 14.654500 18.372625 [silence]
sw2374A-ms98-a-0008 18.372625 27.726625 it's just yeah it's just over just uh about f[ive]- ten minutes ago i guess it was a good game uh they won by about eight i think
sw2374A-ms98-a-0009 27.726625 31.279000 either five or eight it was a good game
sw2374A-ms98-a-0010 31.279000 37.061125 but uh Duke was just too much for them_1 Kansas just couldn't couldn't hang with them
sw2374A-ms98-a-0011 37.061125 40.044000 [silence]
sw2374A-ms98-a-0012 40.044000 54.207000 oh yeah and see i was i was really thinking that they might have a let down because_1 i i i was in a basketball pot and i picked uh Kansas for i guess more or less an upset but i i was thinking that uh
sw2374A-ms98-a-0013 54.207000 63.157000 Duke might have a let down after playing such a tough game with UNLV but uh i tell you what they uh they came back and put it to them_1
sw2374A-ms98-a-0014 63.157000 65.831875 it was a good game
sw2374A-ms98-a-0015 65.831875 72.070625 but i i i had thought all the way through that UNLV was going to be the team that would just walk away with it
sw2374A-ms98-a-0016 72.070625 73.177875 [silence]
sw2374A-ms98-a-0017 73.177875 81.270875 that's [laughter-right] that's right i tell you what they uh they they looked like they were just men among boys
sw2374A-ms98-a-0018 81.270875 85.058000 but they they they fell i tell you
sw2374A-ms98-a-0019 85.058000 96.709125 [silence]
sw2374A-ms98-a-0020 96.709125 107.915250 yeah yeah they they just need to go for it instead of uh worrying about the other team because_1 i think if they would play their game i don't know if there's anybody that could that could keep up with them
sw2374A-ms98-a-0021 107.915250 109.636750 [silence]
sw2374A-ms98-a-0022 109.636750 110.198625 but
sw2374A-ms98-a-0023 110.198625 111.477875 [silence]
sw2374A-ms98-a-0024 111.477875 114.651000 uh i i was since the
sw2374A-ms98-a-0025 114.651000 118.262750 [silence]
sw2374A-ms98-a-0026 118.262750 119.962000 yeah that's right
sw2374A-ms98-a-0027 119.962000 125.964750 yeah here in Dallas i'll tell you what the the Mavericks are having just all kinds of problems
sw2374A-ms98-a-0028 125.964750 127.924625 i tell you
sw2374A-ms98-a-0029 127.924625 129.502750 oh really
sw2374A-ms98-a-0030 129.502750 132.025125 [silence]
sw2374A-ms98-a-0031 132.025125 145.319875 yeah so he he's uh he's probably going to be going to jail and and the problem with him is he's on a guaranteed salary like for three years so whether he plays or not they've got to pay him ten million dollars so if they
sw2374A-ms98-a-0032 145.319875 155.978250 uh they can't hardly trade him because_1 nobody wants to pay that much for him and if they just keep him that hurts their salary cap so that guy's got Dallas in a big old bind
sw2374A-ms98-a-0033 155.978250 163.431625 but uh they they i think they've just got to forget about him and uh try to build a team without him
sw2374A-ms98-a-0034 163.431625 164.534125 [silence]
sw2374A-ms98-a-0035 164.534125 168.991750 maybe go for some good they ought to get some good draft picks this year
sw2374A-ms98-a-0036 168.991750 174.412875 they've uh they've got Derek Harper that's a real good point guard him and Rolando Blackman
sw2374A-ms98-a-0037 174.412875 187.350750 and uh really they're about it they've got a guy named Herb Williams that that i guess sort of was supposed to take the place of uh Tarpley but he uh he just doesn't have the offensive skills
sw2374A-ms98-a-0038 187.350750 193.004375 and then they've got James Donaldson who's been there forever playing center and uh
sw2374A-ms98-a-0039 193.004375 194.222500 [silence]
sw2374A-ms98-a-0040 194.222500 205.731750 just all right but he's getting to where uh i don't know if it's his age or what but he just can't play the whole game they've got to get somebody young that can uh run the court that's still big
sw2374A-ms98-a-0041 205.731750 207.654000 [silence]
sw2374A-ms98-a-0042 207.654000 209.873375 oh uh
sw2374A-ms98-a-0043 209.873375 212.270500 not McCrae but uh
sw2374A-ms98-a-0044 212.270500 213.430000 [silence]
sw2374A-ms98-a-0045 213.430000 215.693500 let's see are you uh Perkins
sw2374A-ms98-a-0046 215.693500 216.803875 [silence]
sw2374A-ms98-a-0047 216.803875 228.610250 they traded Perkins Sam Perkins they traded him he was from North Carolina and uh they traded him to the Lakers last year and that he was a good player and then they they've got a
sw2374A-ms98-a-0048 228.610250 230.040000 yeah
sw2374A-ms98-a-0049 230.040000 239.091375 and then they they uh last year went out and got oh Fat Leever and uh Alex English and and Rodney McCrae
sw2374A-ms98-a-0050 239.091375 245.814875 yeah they didn't and i'm not for sure what the deal is on him i think he's been hurt but he hadn't played
sw2374A-ms98-a-0051 245.814875 248.306375 he hadn't played in probably two months
sw2374A-ms98-a-0052 248.306375 262.115375 and i've i've gone to about three or four of their games and i don't even think he was on the sidelines so i i think he hurt his knee or something but he he definitely didn't turn out to be anything like he was supposed to
sw2374A-ms98-a-0053 262.115375 264.552625 so uh
sw2374A-ms98-a-0054 264.552625 266.589250 [silence]
sw2374A-ms98-a-0055 266.589250 269.302625 it uh you know i i bet it was
sw2374A-ms98-a-0056 269.302625 272.526125 [silence]
sw2374A-ms98-a-0057 272.526125 284.540500 that's right that's right from uh uh Detroit that's right that's who that was yeah because_1 i don't think they got anything from Perkins i think he was a free agent or uh
sw2374A-ms98-a-0058 284.540500 288.213875 yeah free agent his contract ended and they didn't sign him
sw2374A-ms98-a-0059 288.213875 289.480500 and uh
sw2374A-ms98-a-0060 289.480500 291.767375 [silence]
sw2374A-ms98-a-0061 291.767375 296.592750 you know he was but he just went for the the big bucks i think
sw2374A-ms98-a-0062 296.592750 305.682500 Dallas was going to pay him like sixteen million over five years and he got something like eighteen or nineteen million from Las Angeles so he just went where the bucks were
sw2374A-ms98-a-0063 305.682500 311.510625 and shoot you can't blame him man that's that's a phenomenal amount of money
sw2374A-ms98-a-0064 311.510625 317.272250 but uh yeah the Mavericks are sucking it up i tell you
sw2374A-ms98-a-0065 317.272250 318.685000 [silence]
sw2374A-ms98-a-0066 318.685000 324.203250 uh no i don't think so they they were right before the uh uh
sw2374A-ms98-a-0067 324.203250 329.743000 oh what do you call i[t]- all-star break but ever since the all-star break uh
sw2374A-ms98-a-0068 329.743000 332.204875 shoot they've they've played terrible
sw2374A-ms98-a-0069 332.204875 343.046125 and uh so now it'd be really to their benefit to to really play uh some bad ball and and hopefully get a lucky uh lottery pick
sw2374A-ms98-a-0070 343.046125 344.700625 because_1 uh
sw2374A-ms98-a-0071 344.700625 350.002125 there's no way they can e[ven]- i think mathematically they're out of the play-off scene now 
sw2374A-ms98-a-0072 350.002125 354.222000 so you know they they need to just play for a play-off pick 
sw2374A-ms98-a-0073 354.222000 355.155875 or a
sw2374A-ms98-a-0074 355.155875 357.474500 [silence]
sw2374A-ms98-a-0075 357.474500 360.248875 you know the Suns are are pretty good

sw2374A-ms98-a-0079 367.562250 370.851500 yeah and they d[id]- they made some trades uh
sw2374A-ms98-a-0080 370.851500 375.505625 oh they had one white guy i can't think of his name that was real good
sw2374A-ms98-a-0081 375.505625 381.656125 white uh Chambers yeah and uh
sw2374A-ms98-a-0082 381.656125 389.915375 you know if if they could get somebody to help compliment him you know i think they'd be uh awesome because_1 that guy can play
sw2374A-ms98-a-0083 389.915375 392.634750 that Chambers is is something else
sw2374A-ms98-a-0084 392.634750 394.375875 but uh
sw2374A-ms98-a-0085 394.375875 397.340875 i don't know it'll it'll be interesting

sw2374A-ms98-a-0087 400.729750 408.986750 i i really don't follow the pros that close either they they just play so many games that uh you know it's just hard to keep up with them
sw2374A-ms98-a-0088 408.986750 411.537500 but col[lege]- i really enjoy college basketball
