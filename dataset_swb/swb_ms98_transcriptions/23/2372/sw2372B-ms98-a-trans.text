sw2372B-ms98-a-0007 14.444125 19.733125 and so i like the IBM PC personally
sw2372B-ms98-a-0008 19.733125 27.361625 but that's pretty much everything i've worked with and uh i've become so accustomed to it that uh it's li[ke]- second nature

sw2372B-ms98-a-0052 182.426500 193.426250 am pretty much the uh like you said the guru in the office uh with the uh the different programs and any trouble shooting that there is

sw2372B-ms98-a-0054 194.735875 206.900125 uh so they didn't know how it was going to work they're thinking that we were going to have to get a modem so that we could you know uh and a decks machine so that uh in my home so that we could make it through this eight weeks or so [laughter] 
sw2372B-ms98-a-0055 206.900125 210.204750 but uh you know it's uh
sw2372B-ms98-a-0056 210.204750 216.525625 they're they're really great uh it's almost like we could we could become too dependent on them

sw2372B-ms98-a-0058 218.194875 223.337875 i the uh we use a lot of free lance and uh
sw2372B-ms98-a-0059 223.337875 224.938375 that's uh
sw2372B-ms98-a-0060 224.938375 230.359750 pretty much takes up a lot of our day as far as producing transparencies and things

sw2372B-ms98-a-0103 375.551875 383.076375 and uh it's just so y[ou]- you know with budget restraints and things like that it's makes it difficult

sw2372B-ms98-a-0112 398.851250 403.654625 and we uh got a quote on some laser printers the other day at six hundred
sw2372B-ms98-a-0113 403.654625 411.572125 uh yeah i don't remember what kind they were uh but uh we uh do a lot of transparencies
sw2372B-ms98-a-0114 411.572125 416.136625 sometimes the color would take too long to pl[ot]- uh to plot out 
sw2372B-ms98-a-0115 416.136625 421.492875 so they just want black and white ones and see we can just run them through the laser printer real quick
sw2372B-ms98-a-0116 421.492875 426.663500 because it will only take a minute to print one of those out and then run a thermal copy of it
sw2372B-ms98-a-0117 426.663500 428.415375 but uh it uh

sw2372B-ms98-a-0121 440.417750 451.258125 it's uh yeah we we have one in the office and if we want to use it well in our area if we want to use it we have to you know like you said you had to had to change it uh put it on a disk 
sw2372B-ms98-a-0122 451.258125 454.971625 and carry it over to there and see if they're not using the [vocalized-noise] the printer

sw2372B-ms98-a-0124 456.953375 463.334875 right [laughter] and uh wait for an opportunity to use it

sw2372B-ms98-a-0148 567.010750 575.527750 how are we supposed to present the imagine that we're supposed to present with equipment that's outdated and when it's obsolete
sw2372B-ms98-a-0149 575.527750 588.539125 and the the guys that that some of the guys that run this place are very tight and it's like well why do we need this can't you do that with you know what we have and and when we try and then they complain about this doesn't look good
