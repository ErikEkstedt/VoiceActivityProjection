sw2372A-ms98-a-0016 45.951875 54.703750 and i just use my PC constantly not only do i do PC type things like uh using lotus or word processors 
sw2372A-ms98-a-0017 54.703750 64.227500 i also use my PC to emulate a mainframe terminal for our IBM mainframe and also to emulate a deck terminal for our deck machine
sw2372A-ms98-a-0018 64.227500 75.722125 so all i have on my desk is my PC but i'm i'm getting not only our local area network but i'm getting two separate mainframe machines also

sw2372A-ms98-a-0030 112.449125 121.436500 yeah i've become kind of the PC guru in our audit department because it's mostly financial auditors with an accounting back ground
sw2372A-ms98-a-0031 121.436500 131.414625 and there's uh three of us EDP auditors and one of the three of us has an accounting background and so she's not real proficient in PCs and the other 
sw2372A-ms98-a-0032 131.414625 142.977750 just hasn't used PCs that much so i ended up taking on the load of making sure everybody knows what they're doing and i'm the administrator for our local area network and i need to keep that going and
sw2372A-ms98-a-0033 142.977750 144.489250 so
sw2372A-ms98-a-0034 144.489250 149.528125 i i'm i couldn't live my life without a PC now i don't have one at home

sw2372A-ms98-a-0037 153.528375 158.950000 yeah i wou[ld]- right now i would rather not have one at home because i would work at home
sw2372A-ms98-a-0038 158.950000 166.264375 um we've got a couple of portable lap top PCs at the office that i end up bringing one of them home a lot
sw2372A-ms98-a-0039 166.264375 173.508125 to do work and if i had a machine already installed at home i would probably work just about [laughter-every] night

sw2372A-ms98-a-0055 261.350000 269.550000 yeah just the power i'm i'm trying to uh get an upgraded machine mine is uh just putting along and it's just not fast enough for me 
sw2372A-ms98-a-0056 269.550000 273.642875 so i want to get a new uh four eighty six chip but i don't [laughter-know] 
sw2372A-ms98-a-0057 273.642875 276.934625 i don't know if my boss will spring for it
sw2372A-ms98-a-0058 276.934625 278.861625 but i'm i'm i'm
sw2372A-ms98-a-0059 278.861625 283.173750 i determined to brake mine so he has to get me another one
sw2372A-ms98-a-0060 283.173750 284.028250 [noise]
sw2372A-ms98-a-0061 284.028250 285.501250 yeah
sw2372A-ms98-a-0062 285.501250 290.584500 well that's what i do we had a printer a a Hewlett Packard Ready Writer
sw2372A-ms98-a-0063 290.584500 302.297000 and we had about ten people sharing this printer by it was attached to like a central PC and you had to take your diskette to the PC to print something
sw2372A-ms98-a-0064 302.297000 310.283375 so the first thing when i started work at this bank was i said well now first of all we need to all be able to share this PC without getting up 
sw2372A-ms98-a-0065 310.283375 314.847125 so i talked my boss into investing in a it's not a uh yeah 
sw2372A-ms98-a-0066 314.847125 319.944500 a uh real elaborate local area network but we can share the printer
sw2372A-ms98-a-0067 319.944500 331.070625 and we can uh send ma[il]- uh files to each other and we can mail send mail messages to each other which is what which is good enough it's what we need 
sw2372A-ms98-a-0068 331.070625 335.115250 and then i talked them into buying a HP Laser Jet
sw2372A-ms98-a-0069 335.115250 340.957875 and [vocalized-noise] that was a major ordeal to get him to buy it but once he bought it he has been so pleased 
sw2372A-ms98-a-0070 340.957875 346.876375 it's it's fast it's quite oh it has good copy
sw2372A-ms98-a-0071 346.876375 351.344000 [silence]
sw2372A-ms98-a-0072 351.344000 364.746750 yeah i've i've got a little little uh IBM Pro Printer on my desk but and i can use either the Pro Printer or i've got my PC configured to where i can use either printer the one that's on the network or my own 
sw2372A-ms98-a-0073 364.746750 371.603250 so if i just need something real quick and i don't feel like getting up and going and getting what i printed i can just print it in my office
sw2372A-ms98-a-0074 371.603250 375.316375 [silence]
sw2372A-ms98-a-0075 375.316375 376.492875 yeah

sw2372A-ms98-a-0077 383.027125 389.043500 they have gotten really cheap Hewlett Packard makes it's it's actually a dot matrix printer
sw2372A-ms98-a-0078 389.043500 392.662750 but the quality is almost uh laser quality
sw2372A-ms98-a-0079 392.662750 395.263375 and i think it's called the desk jet
sw2372A-ms98-a-0080 395.263375 399.322125 and they're under i think they're uh about eight hundred dollars now
sw2372A-ms98-a-0081 399.322125 403.244625 [silence]

sw2372A-ms98-a-0100 462.828000 468.120375 yeah we used to have to just sit and wait while someone else was using the printer 
sw2372A-ms98-a-0101 468.120375 470.165000 until they got off the machine
sw2372A-ms98-a-0102 470.165000 471.402625 [silence]
sw2372A-ms98-a-0103 471.402625 476.757375 that was uh i was amazed when i came to work i worked at the uh
sw2372A-ms98-a-0104 476.757375 484.916500 well it used to be the largest bank in San Antonio until N C N B came in and bought up the rival and now N C N B's got a little larger market share 
sw2372A-ms98-a-0105 484.916500 489.243500 but it's the [vocalized-noise] it's the only uh 
sw2372A-ms98-a-0106 489.243500 497.350500 well it's part of the bank holding company and that bank holding company of the ten largest banking holding companies in Texas it's the only one that's still alive
sw2372A-ms98-a-0107 497.350500 500.907000 so any way i work in a in a big prestigious place 
sw2372A-ms98-a-0108 500.907000 511.788625 and i couldn't believe when i walked in the door on my first day and here's the audit department of this this huge holding company sharing a HP Rugged Writer
sw2372A-ms98-a-0109 511.788625 514.243875 i was going oh wait a minute [laughter]

sw2372A-ms98-a-0111 516.981625 522.406125 [silence]
sw2372A-ms98-a-0112 522.406125 534.544500 yeah yeah we're we're pushing real hard though we're we're trying well see the the entire bank is not like that we the the bank philosophy is one of innova[tion]- innovation and lead the market 
sw2372A-ms98-a-0113 534.544500 542.988250 it's just the [laughter-audit] department happened to be just a little behind the times because the uh the senior vice president over audits is cheap
sw2372A-ms98-a-0114 542.988250 544.008000 [silence]
sw2372A-ms98-a-0115 544.008000 555.314875 and it's real hard to pry money out of him to to t[o]- do these things but i was i was able to convince him that it would be cost effective and that our board presentations would be much better and
sw2372A-ms98-a-0116 555.314875 556.852000 [silence]
