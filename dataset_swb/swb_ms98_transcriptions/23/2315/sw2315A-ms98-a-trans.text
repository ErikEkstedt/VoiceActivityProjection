sw2315A-ms98-a-0003 5.329500 11.580000 [silence]
sw2315A-ms98-a-0004 11.580000 16.788375 yeah a lot of people are you going to buy one of those minivans or you going to buy a full size
sw2315A-ms98-a-0005 16.788375 27.065000 [silence]
sw2315A-ms98-a-0006 27.065000 30.729500 was the gas mileage decent or
sw2315A-ms98-a-0007 30.729500 33.147125 oh that's not bad
sw2315A-ms98-a-0008 33.147125 38.507875 [silence]
sw2315A-ms98-a-0009 38.507875 39.359000 well
sw2315A-ms98-a-0010 39.359000 42.375125 [silence]
sw2315A-ms98-a-0011 42.375125 51.061500 oh i've never i've really never had a new car i mean i'm pretty young so but a lot of people they go out and buy new cars
sw2315A-ms98-a-0012 51.061500 57.360125 you know i've i've been -[em]ployed for ten years so i- i have enough money to go out and buy a new one
sw2315A-ms98-a-0013 57.360125 64.553125 but instead i go out and buy toys and things [laughter] oh um but
sw2315A-ms98-a-0014 64.553125 75.714875 see my situation's really different because i always had an older brother that always worked on cars and he got into business and he only worked on one kind of car
sw2315A-ms98-a-0015 75.714875 89.541750 yeah and what happened is he his he had a business and they and they bought a lot of cars a lot of the same kind of cars what ended up he he eventually had his own private junkyard which is 
sw2315A-ms98-a-0016 89.541750 99.925000 terrible to look at very illegal but it was very cheap for us to run our cars because pretty much everyone in the family and there's seven of us kids
sw2315A-ms98-a-0017 99.925000 114.586250 would have one i mean me and my husband have the same kind of car my brother and his wife drive the same kind of car my sister has the same kind of car and my father has the same kind so it's you know when we get together and go places
sw2315A-ms98-a-0018 114.586250 120.180000 and we meet places it's like gee you guys don't like one kind of car do you
sw2315A-ms98-a-0019 120.180000 125.463875 it's a very strange car i don't know y[ou]- if you have them down there but it's a Saab
sw2315A-ms98-a-0020 125.463875 129.117500 yeah they're not that popular down south i don't
sw2315A-ms98-a-0021 129.117500 139.826625 i maybe it's something to do with the front wheel drive and they're supposed to be good in snow but they're very popular up here in Vermont and a lot of people used to bring his car their cars
sw2315A-ms98-a-0022 139.826625 151.248125 to him to get them fixed because he was he was really good at it and uh he didn't charge as much as the dealer so and he also was really nice to people and
sw2315A-ms98-a-0023 151.248125 161.493250 he'd help them out a lot if they were broke down he'd try to go fix their car on the road instead of calling the tow truck so that saved them a lot of money
sw2315A-ms98-a-0024 161.493250 175.123000 [silence]
sw2315A-ms98-a-0025 175.123000 187.470500 yeah i've heard that that's a really good way to get cars up here th[ey]- they only come around like once a year in the summertime they have a state auction but but they don't um
sw2315A-ms98-a-0026 187.470500 200.780750 they don't repossess that many cars up here figure in a big metropolitan area there would be a lot of uh where they repo[ssess]- they uh take their cars for illegal activities you know it
sw2315A-ms98-a-0027 200.780750 202.585875 [vocalized-noise]
sw2315A-ms98-a-0028 202.585875 211.327250 can imagine you have a good you have a you could have a good uh choice of cars but then of course there's more people interested in them too 
sw2315A-ms98-a-0029 211.327250 221.809625 huh i don't know but i know someone who goes to Massachusetts and buys cars that have been wrecked or uh salvaged they p[robably]- they might have been stolen and
sw2315A-ms98-a-0030 221.809625 233.996625 the insurance company buys them and they sell them_1 and i've known people who have got really nice late model cars very cheap but but they have a dubious background they have salvage stamped on their title there's
sw2315A-ms98-a-0031 233.996625 239.984375 there one of my friends got one that the the whole underneath the car the frame was twisted
sw2315A-ms98-a-0032 239.984375 247.858000 and they didn't really know it it was a real nice late model car real pretty on the outside but they couldn't keep tires on it it kept eating the tires
sw2315A-ms98-a-0033 247.858000 250.663125 [silence]
sw2315A-ms98-a-0034 250.663125 251.853375 yep
sw2315A-ms98-a-0035 251.853375 258.247500 i know a lot of people who've [boughten/bought] other cars the same way and and have done very well
sw2315A-ms98-a-0036 258.247500 265.994375 i mean i the my car that i drive came out of um a salvage yard but i s[ee]- see it wasn't um
sw2315A-ms98-a-0037 265.994375 279.594250 wasn't in an accident it had burned the whole inside of it burned the wire and cable burned and of course my brother being the clever person he was had an identical car but it had been in an accident
sw2315A-ms98-a-0038 279.594250 286.642000 so we took the wiring harness out and the engine and the transmission and everything else and we put it into the the
sw2315A-ms98-a-0039 286.642000 295.137250 the shell that was burned we had the shell all sandblasted and painted and he he pretty much built me a car so
sw2315A-ms98-a-0040 295.137250 302.431000 yeah i was i was pretty happy i got what i pretty much wanted i could have had it any color i wanted
sw2315A-ms98-a-0041 302.431000 315.738125 [silence]
sw2315A-ms98-a-0042 315.738125 324.916750 that's true but you know i always thought American cars weren't any good but i uh rented a car i rented a Ford Taurus and i was impressed i really liked it
sw2315A-ms98-a-0043 324.916750 337.059125 yeah and uh i was talking to my older sister the other day and uh she said she had to get a new car and they were thinking of getting something big enough she's got two teenage kids and they go camping a lot
sw2315A-ms98-a-0044 337.059125 345.126000 and she was thinking of getting a Ford Taurus wagon she says they're not very pretty but like she was really impressed but i liked them a lot because
sw2315A-ms98-a-0045 345.126000 358.396875 they resembled the Saab when i got inside the door was big you know it wasn't it wasn't like a Volkswagen Rabbit you know i- i mean it had a full size door handle on it and it was the interior
sw2315A-ms98-a-0046 358.396875 367.578500 was very plush and padded it it was just i liked the car a lot and when you shut the door it made a real solid [laughter] sound
sw2315A-ms98-a-0047 367.578500 373.428250 and the performance it you know it it you could make it do anything on the interstate you wanted
sw2315A-ms98-a-0048 373.428250 380.387250 so i was really impressed if i if i didn't h[ave]- have if i didn't buy uh used Saabs
sw2315A-ms98-a-0049 380.387250 391.511625 you know if i didn't have a father and a brother that help me out i would even think about buying something like a Ford Taurus as opposed to a Volkswagen Rabbit or a Toyota
sw2315A-ms98-a-0050 391.511625 393.480250 but that's one thing about
sw2315A-ms98-a-0051 393.480250 406.638875 cars my husband wants a Toyota pickup truck and i can't talk him into a Dodge pickup truck or a Chevy pickup he wants a Toyota pickup truck and they are they're very popular and i guess they run
sw2315A-ms98-a-0052 406.638875 412.643500 they they you they just keep running and running and running they have a really good track record
sw2315A-ms98-a-0053 412.643500 417.949000 [silence]
sw2315A-ms98-a-0054 417.949000 432.072750 yeah i know this this this person they go they have this old Toyota truck and he goes yep i say you know this thing's been running for me for two years he goes boy i wish i had the money to treat it right i'm like what do you mean
sw2315A-ms98-a-0055 432.072750 444.284250 he says i haven't tuned it up in two years and i change the oil about every four months because_1 he can't afford to um change the oil as often as as he would like and he can't afford to tune it up
sw2315A-ms98-a-0056 444.284250 448.200125 so it it's amazing even when you abuse them
sw2315A-ms98-a-0057 448.200125 449.675500 [noise]
sw2315A-ms98-a-0058 449.675500 470.427375 [silence]
sw2315A-ms98-a-0059 470.427375 472.154125 all the time
sw2315A-ms98-a-0060 472.154125 482.787750 well i- i have problems with my car i'm not saying it's not perfect or anything but i wouldn't trade my Saab for [laughter-anything] i
sw2315A-ms98-a-0061 482.787750 484.130875 yeah
sw2315A-ms98-a-0062 484.130875 494.456375 it it's a Swedish car i'm just being stupid and sentimental it's just because it's about the only kind of car i've ever had i had a Volvo once
sw2315A-ms98-a-0063 494.456375 497.868750 you know it's like if i had to go out if i
sw2315A-ms98-a-0064 497.868750 507.194500 to buy a truck i could i could go out and easily buy a truck but i'd have a hard time going out and buying another car if it wasn't a Saab i don't know
sw2315A-ms98-a-0065 507.194500 508.253625 [silence]
sw2315A-ms98-a-0066 508.253625 513.301875 um it was it was fine but it was an old one and um
sw2315A-ms98-a-0067 513.301875 523.322750 it was pretty much it uh uh was something that i bought to resell because it was really uh it was a nice old Volvo
sw2315A-ms98-a-0068 523.322750 532.054500 and at that time i was going to college and i liked to go camping and {bajaing} and going up dirt roads and i was ruining the car so i sold it
sw2315A-ms98-a-0069 532.054500 537.985750 and i saved some money by buying a junkier Saab that i could beat around
sw2315A-ms98-a-0070 537.985750 541.089250 so it it worked out pretty well
sw2315A-ms98-a-0071 541.089250 547.801125 i've never had problems really getting getting cars it's it's refusing them
sw2315A-ms98-a-0072 547.801125 561.481750 because uh people always come to my father and brother and try to sell their old cars to them_1 because they know that they deal and sell them_1 [laughter] yes my father's very shrewd with them [laughter]
sw2315A-ms98-a-0073 561.481750 572.557125 [silence]

sw2315A-ms98-a-0076 576.815500 586.587625 [laughter-yeah] that's a good way to do it um the thing about it is you got to you got to like to work on cars to be a mechanic if you want to be involved and that's a hard job
sw2315A-ms98-a-0077 586.587625 589.035875 well i you know i always
sw2315A-ms98-a-0078 589.035875 591.881125 dream of buying a new car but
sw2315A-ms98-a-0079 591.881125 597.984625 yeah i don't it just the money just isn't worth that that shininess
sw2315A-ms98-a-0080 597.984625 600.262625 yes they're very expensive i mean e[ven]-
