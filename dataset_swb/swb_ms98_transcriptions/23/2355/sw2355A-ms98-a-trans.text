sw2355A-ms98-a-0015 44.695000 51.340500 you couldn't become a political figure or president unless you had served in the war but then in Vietnam
sw2355A-ms98-a-0016 51.340500 56.393250 that was totally different you know you couldn't be a political figure if you were in Vietnam probably
sw2355A-ms98-a-0017 56.393250 61.321625 and now if you've served in Desert Storm you probably would be a a good candidate
sw2355A-ms98-a-0018 61.321625 62.579375 [silence]
sw2355A-ms98-a-0019 62.579375 63.591875 ex[actly]-

sw2355A-ms98-a-0038 121.434250 122.585875 but uh

sw2355A-ms98-a-0046 150.279250 157.314625 uh probably a good part of the war um as far as what people thought about it and a lot of things like that so
sw2355A-ms98-a-0047 157.314625 160.928375 it was kind of amazing people were coming to me to ask me
sw2355A-ms98-a-0048 160.928375 166.918625 you know what's going on you know like i knew or like i sat in on the meetings or something
sw2355A-ms98-a-0049 166.918625 173.962875 yeah yeah so i got to hear a lot of what the people thought about you know changes in in the war and everything
sw2355A-ms98-a-0050 173.962875 176.102625 so that was pretty interesting
sw2355A-ms98-a-0051 176.102625 182.613000 [silence]
sw2355A-ms98-a-0052 182.613000 184.203375 yeah

sw2355A-ms98-a-0058 198.811875 200.750375 right and
sw2355A-ms98-a-0059 200.750375 204.913500 where as it would have been exactly um
sw2355A-ms98-a-0060 204.913500 213.343250 [silence]
sw2355A-ms98-a-0061 213.343250 217.227875 right the roles are changing a lot
sw2355A-ms98-a-0062 217.227875 224.415875 uh-huh
sw2355A-ms98-a-0063 224.415875 226.213875 right

sw2355A-ms98-a-0065 229.155875 232.459625 and even you know i think a lot of the movies we see now
sw2355A-ms98-a-0066 232.459625 239.287875 kind of kind of play a good part in our changes because you see that they have The Three Men and a Baby type movies
sw2355A-ms98-a-0067 239.287875 242.929250 and i think you know to yeah and then you have the women
sw2355A-ms98-a-0068 242.929250 251.265750 uh detectives now and you know different roles just in what we see and so we probably want to do that even more now
sw2355A-ms98-a-0069 251.265750 260.068750 you know since the women's movement in the we[ll]- seventies and you know we've come a long way but i think it's still a still [vocalized-noise] good ways to go
sw2355A-ms98-a-0070 260.068750 264.795750 so
sw2355A-ms98-a-0071 264.795750 267.063875 uh-huh [noise]

sw2355A-ms98-a-0080 287.230000 289.345875 it's just not as
sw2355A-ms98-a-0081 289.345875 296.082625 exactly but it's i mean like i say we've come a long way but we have i mean twice as far to go still
sw2355A-ms98-a-0082 296.082625 301.281250 and i don't think a lot of people you know realize a lot the plight of a lot of people
sw2355A-ms98-a-0083 301.281250 305.116875 you know and you may be in good standing and everything may look hunky-dory to you
sw2355A-ms98-a-0084 305.116875 310.169500 but there's so many more people exactly that you don't even and that you don't even see or know about

sw2355A-ms98-a-0093 339.953125 348.953625 and so now i i feel lucky actually because i've almost lived around everyone i've i went to UT to college and so they you know they have
sw2355A-ms98-a-0094 348.953625 361.551750 a lot of different people go there different kinds of people and so i feel really enriched in that a lot of people don't get to see you know some people have lived in Lewisville all their life you know and so they don't get to see
sw2355A-ms98-a-0095 361.551750 363.598750 [laughter-exactly] and that

sw2355A-ms98-a-0107 393.956750 401.757125 she met a gi[rl]- she's going to the University of Pennsylvania in in Philadelphia and uh she just met a girl from um i think
sw2355A-ms98-a-0108 401.757125 404.770375 Barbados or Jamaica or something like that
sw2355A-ms98-a-0109 404.770375 415.027625 and i mean this girl she had like two outfits that she would just wear all the time and everything and she got some kind of money from her government like five hundred dollars so my sister had to take her shopping and
sw2355A-ms98-a-0110 415.027625 423.768125 you know show her what to wear show her how to match up colors and i just thought that was so very exciting you know to go and and just witness
