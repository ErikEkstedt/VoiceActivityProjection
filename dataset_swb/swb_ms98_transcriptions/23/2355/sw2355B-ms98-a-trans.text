sw2355B-ms98-a-0002 0.560125 5.330750 okay 
sw2355B-ms98-a-0003 5.330750 8.121125 the war you mean in terms of the economy or
sw2355B-ms98-a-0004 8.121125 12.960000 [vocalized-noise]
sw2355B-ms98-a-0005 12.960000 15.947500 oh i thought we were going to talk about social changes
sw2355B-ms98-a-0006 15.947500 22.485000 is that is that what you're kind of directing it oh okay okay well [laughter] um
sw2355B-ms98-a-0007 22.485000 25.382875 well i think it's caused a lot of you know
sw2355B-ms98-a-0008 25.382875 38.081875 big difference between when people had gone to war before like compared to Vietnam because i mean i know that there was so much more support for the soldiers going over and even people that didn't agree with the war still seem to be able to separate that
sw2355B-ms98-a-0009 38.081875 40.258625 you know and support the soldiers so
sw2355B-ms98-a-0010 40.258625 48.810625 [silence]
sw2355B-ms98-a-0011 48.810625 50.607375 yeah
sw2355B-ms98-a-0012 50.607375 56.011000 [silence]
sw2355B-ms98-a-0013 56.011000 57.930750 yeah yeah
sw2355B-ms98-a-0014 57.930750 60.902000 [silence]
sw2355B-ms98-a-0015 60.902000 64.181625 yeah it would be like a bonus for your image or something
sw2355B-ms98-a-0016 64.181625 70.239250 yeah it i'm sure it caused a lot of changes in terms of how many families had to have their income
sw2355B-ms98-a-0017 70.239250 80.319250 just drastically altered we had people down the street that the guy was in the reserves and he was just about ready to go and they have a just had a new baby and uh they would have she would have had to go back to work and
sw2355B-ms98-a-0018 80.319250 83.390500 i think she said their income would have dropped by like two thirds
sw2355B-ms98-a-0019 83.390500 87.379625 [silence]
sw2355B-ms98-a-0020 87.379625 99.575875 yeah yeah i think the biggest change that we've seen um in in my life or whatever lately is the economy and things are so tight and like my husband hasn't gotten a raise in two years and you know
sw2355B-ms98-a-0021 99.575875 103.018375 [silence]
sw2355B-ms98-a-0022 103.018375 104.604875 yeah
sw2355B-ms98-a-0023 104.604875 107.827250 [silence]
sw2355B-ms98-a-0024 107.827250 110.568375 even dog licenses [laughter-i] [laughter-mean]
sw2355B-ms98-a-0025 110.568375 111.604625 [silence]
sw2355B-ms98-a-0026 111.604625 112.468875 yeah
sw2355B-ms98-a-0027 112.468875 113.252375 [silence]
sw2355B-ms98-a-0028 113.252375 114.351750 yeah
sw2355B-ms98-a-0029 114.351750 117.740000 [silence]
sw2355B-ms98-a-0030 117.740000 119.883000 going to effect too many
sw2355B-ms98-a-0031 119.883000 121.701500 yeah yeah
sw2355B-ms98-a-0032 121.701500 131.499625 so that's the hardest thing for us and um we've been trying to kind of maintain traditional lifestyle in the sense of meaning home we have a three year old and a two year old and i'm trying to stay home as long as i can
sw2355B-ms98-a-0033 131.499625 135.623625 but you know every week [laughter-it] [laughter-gets] [laughter-harder] because i could go out and be making money
sw2355B-ms98-a-0034 135.623625 141.675250 you know so that's a big uh stress i think you know for the social changes in our family
sw2355B-ms98-a-0035 141.675250 145.370750 [silence]
sw2355B-ms98-a-0036 145.370750 147.081875 oh i see
sw2355B-ms98-a-0037 147.081875 154.619625 [silence]
sw2355B-ms98-a-0038 154.619625 156.114000 uh-huh
sw2355B-ms98-a-0039 156.114000 158.617125 yeah yeah well it
sw2355B-ms98-a-0040 158.617125 165.309625 [laughter]
sw2355B-ms98-a-0041 165.309625 168.203125 yeah you have an inside track or something
sw2355B-ms98-a-0042 168.203125 175.208375 [silence]
sw2355B-ms98-a-0043 175.208375 177.519500 yeah yeah
sw2355B-ms98-a-0044 177.519500 189.303625 let's see what other social changes in the past ten years oh i guess between men and women i've seen a lot of changes in terms of women feeling like they have to have a career be mom be everything superperson
sw2355B-ms98-a-0045 189.303625 190.079125 [laughter]
sw2355B-ms98-a-0046 190.079125 199.161625 yeah because_1 i know you know i i really get pressure from because_1 i have a career also and i get a lot of pressure from people that you know my colleagues that why am i staying home
sw2355B-ms98-a-0047 199.161625 204.003250 you know whereas before that never would have [laughter-happened] people would have said why are you going to work
sw2355B-ms98-a-0048 204.003250 209.169625 so that's kind of a difference for us i think there's more pressure to um
sw2355B-ms98-a-0049 209.169625 213.819125 not necessarily a negative thing but on my husband to be more involved with the family
sw2355B-ms98-a-0050 213.819125 215.748500 so he's
sw2355B-ms98-a-0051 215.748500 225.354125 yeah he's gotten a lot uh you know you see all kinds of men being involved in the housework and taking care of the kids and all but in terms of his amount of hours at work nothing on that has lightened up
sw2355B-ms98-a-0052 225.354125 229.147500 so it's now he has the pressure too of being super dad and super career and
sw2355B-ms98-a-0053 229.147500 237.869250 [silence]
sw2355B-ms98-a-0054 237.869250 241.034750 yeah that's true mister mom and
sw2355B-ms98-a-0055 241.034750 246.255250 [silence]
sw2355B-ms98-a-0056 246.255250 247.565000 uh-huh

sw2355B-ms98-a-0058 250.300875 252.399500 yeah yeah
sw2355B-ms98-a-0059 252.399500 255.049750 [silence]
sw2355B-ms98-a-0060 255.049750 256.614000 that's true
sw2355B-ms98-a-0061 256.614000 258.841375 [silence]
sw2355B-ms98-a-0062 258.841375 269.387875 yeah yeah i think there's still i i know that um i grew up in Chicago in the sixties and was part my family was real liberal and i think there's a lot of um
sw2355B-ms98-a-0063 269.387875 275.880625 kind of myths that we've come a long way just in terms of our society and race relations and things like that and
sw2355B-ms98-a-0064 275.880625 284.992625 you know i think there's so much prejudice still there and it's kind of more covert now people used to be more clear and say you know well i believe in this or i believe in that and now
sw2355B-ms98-a-0065 284.992625 290.886625 you know i think there's still tremendous amount of prejudice but people think oh we're in the nineties we're beyond all that you know
sw2355B-ms98-a-0066 290.886625 294.799375 [silence]
sw2355B-ms98-a-0067 294.799375 296.806375 yeah yeah

sw2355B-ms98-a-0071 304.779125 308.458375 but there's so many more people that are homeless and yeah
sw2355B-ms98-a-0072 308.458375 309.912125 [silence]
sw2355B-ms98-a-0073 309.912125 319.240750 yeah it's real easy to get isolated in your own little community you know because wh[en]- when i was growing up in Chicago um we were in a real ethnic neighborhood and there were people from all
sw2355B-ms98-a-0074 319.240750 326.334000 first generation Chinese German you know all different nationalities and everything and now we're kind of like in Lewisville Miss White Little suburbia you know
