sw2302B-ms98-a-0002 1.015125 43.810875 [silence]
sw2302B-ms98-a-0003 43.810875 51.369875 well i think i think basically we're in a lot of agreement uh in that i certainly agree that
sw2302B-ms98-a-0004 51.369875 62.122750 for any case involving serious injury to another person then maybe that needs uh some kind of legal definition
sw2302B-ms98-a-0005 62.122750 68.896625 but for anything involving that [noise] a trial by jury certainly should be mandatory 
sw2302B-ms98-a-0006 68.896625 72.205000 but there should be uh with our
sw2302B-ms98-a-0007 72.205000 74.454875 overworked
sw2302B-ms98-a-0008 74.454875 81.098625 uh judicial system it seems to me like there ought to be a means of
sw2302B-ms98-a-0009 81.098625 82.850750 of um
sw2302B-ms98-a-0010 82.850750 87.249500 not having to take everything
sw2302B-ms98-a-0011 87.249500 89.545625 before a
sw2302B-ms98-a-0012 89.545625 98.481375 full court you know maybe there ought to be some kind of of uh a[s]- as as an example where called a jury duty now
sw2302B-ms98-a-0013 98.481375 103.368750 and and maybe instead of of uh
sw2302B-ms98-a-0014 103.368750 108.745750 just kind of blowing it off and just spend a day or a day and a half like most folks do
sw2302B-ms98-a-0015 108.745750 121.669250 maybe we should commit to spend a week and during that week you're kind of an ad hoc let's hear about it group of i don't know twenty five instead of twelve
sw2302B-ms98-a-0016 121.669250 131.463000 and ea[ch]- each case is presented to that group of of twenty five and those cases are of lesser degrees of magnitude
sw2302B-ms98-a-0017 131.463000 145.349375 you know the guy was caught burgling uh and he had his pockets full of stuff you know when he was caught uh you know that kind of stuff you can just turn to the judge and say you know your pleasure your honor
sw2302B-ms98-a-0018 145.349375 159.936875 and there's not a lot of discussion about that kind of thing but the way our system our court system works that guy's going to have to hang around in jail or out on bail or something like that for an extreme period of time
sw2302B-ms98-a-0019 159.936875 168.129125 uh i just think our system is overworked and we're starting to stress the true meaning of of right to a speedy trial
sw2302B-ms98-a-0020 168.129125 203.348125 [silence]
sw2302B-ms98-a-0021 203.348125 204.649500 you know we
sw2302B-ms98-a-0022 204.649500 206.689375 [silence]
sw2302B-ms98-a-0023 206.689375 213.677250 you know kind of deltaing off what what we've been talking about here uh i believe that
sw2302B-ms98-a-0024 213.677250 223.709750 our we['ve]- we've become almost litigious uh society where we're e[veryone]- everyone is very quick to sue or to threaten to sue and that kind of stuff
sw2302B-ms98-a-0025 223.709750 231.442250 and although we're supporting a whole segment of society called lawyers maybe we don't need to do that
sw2302B-ms98-a-0026 231.442250 239.543625 you know maybe instead of of being so quick to sue you uh if you have a disagreement with someone
sw2302B-ms98-a-0027 239.543625 248.827625 instead of tying up court and time and that kind of stuff maybe you nee[d]- you and if you want to your lawyer or your your opponent
sw2302B-ms98-a-0028 248.827625 256.907750 need to go face this group of twenty five or a Judge Wapner like you know that they have on TV and let
sw2302B-ms98-a-0029 256.907750 265.211500 either he or that group decide whether or not you have a real case and let's you know let's get rid of some of this harassment suing
sw2302B-ms98-a-0030 265.211500 287.191375 [silence]
sw2302B-ms98-a-0031 287.191375 289.325000 you bet and if
sw2302B-ms98-a-0032 289.325000 294.553500 if we could all deal with those kinds of beliefs we wouldn't have half the
sw2302B-ms98-a-0033 294.553500 312.913250 [silence]
sw2302B-ms98-a-0034 312.913250 321.152000 yes i'd forgotten what that's called there's a a real name for that like the Judean law or something like that
sw2302B-ms98-a-0035 321.152000 327.091500 [silence]
sw2302B-ms98-a-0036 327.091500 335.753000 well that may be right it's in there some place i think we both know w[hat]- that we're talking about the foundation of our legal society
sw2302B-ms98-a-0037 335.753000 337.412375 uh t[o]-
sw2302B-ms98-a-0038 337.412375 344.722375 and too the that was sort of the the beginning of ye shall be treated fairly
sw2302B-ms98-a-0039 344.722375 346.325000 uh
sw2302B-ms98-a-0040 346.325000 347.750375 [silence]
sw2302B-ms98-a-0041 347.750375 356.072375 i guess the the Lord started out with we'll treat you f[airly]- i'll treat you fairly there as long as you do what i say
sw2302B-ms98-a-0042 356.072375 359.447375 uh that's sort of the Old Testament version
sw2302B-ms98-a-0043 359.447375 360.759625 [silence]
sw2302B-ms98-a-0044 360.759625 371.430750 i know i did a Sunday school lesson one time on the difference between the Old Testament and the New Testament where where there's a vengeful Lord in the Old Testament and there's a loving Lord in the New Testament but that's a whole different subject
sw2302B-ms98-a-0045 371.430750 372.817625 [silence]
sw2302B-ms98-a-0046 372.817625 380.655875 okay well i i think we have exhausted my pitifully small knowledge on on the legal system
sw2302B-ms98-a-0047 380.655875 383.148875 but it's been a pleasure talking with you
sw2302B-ms98-a-0048 383.148875 385.469500 [silence]
sw2302B-ms98-a-0049 385.469500 388.064000 i'm living here in Texas
sw2302B-ms98-a-0050 388.064000 390.556875 [silence]
sw2302B-ms98-a-0051 390.556875 392.235875 well that's quite all right
sw2302B-ms98-a-0052 392.235875 394.262625 [silence]
sw2302B-ms98-a-0053 394.262625 399.676000 well so am i [laughter] fact i'm at work out at Lewisville 
sw2302B-ms98-a-0054 399.676000 404.141500 [silence]
sw2302B-ms98-a-0055 404.141500 407.496750 my pleasure have a good day bye-bye
