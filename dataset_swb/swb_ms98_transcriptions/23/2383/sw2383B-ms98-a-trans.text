sw2383B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 5.868250 well in the [norman/normal] i[n]- in the normal route of way we do things how about_1 the ladies go first
sw2383B-ms98-a-0002 5.868250 39.163500 [silence]
sw2383B-ms98-a-0003 39.163500 43.475125 all right i'm uh live in Plano Texas and uh um
sw2383B-ms98-a-0004 43.475125 55.093125 uh today we're not even suppose to be in school because the uh the way the taxation and all that crap is there really legally isn't any funding for the school systems in Texas today
sw2383B-ms98-a-0005 55.093125 58.771375 so uh i mean when you when you take uh
sw2383B-ms98-a-0006 58.771375 68.262875 uh professionals and put them_1 in situations they have to make decisions based on money to fund public education and they can't get their finger out of their ear long enough to
sw2383B-ms98-a-0007 68.262875 74.697000 to get that major subject in line something's wrong so i think here in Texas mainly that the the
sw2383B-ms98-a-0008 74.697000 88.176375 they're not serious they're more serious about what the salary should be for senators than they are for what how the level of education should be for children i have a one year old so i'm not i'm more opinionated about the observations than than the than the true facts but
sw2383B-ms98-a-0009 88.176375 98.319375 uh it's just a shame to me tha[t]- that that the our firemen our policemen and school teachers are the three least paid utilities um that have the biggest impact to our well-being
sw2383B-ms98-a-0010 98.319375 107.241375 i have a i have a a real issue with that um i think that if from every year when they when they pull in the the the the uh test 
sw2383B-ms98-a-0011 107.241375 121.370375 that the last three years you know ten eleven twelve year uh graders take and and and you see that their their education is below the norm throughout of all fifty states then that's saying that something's wrong with the educational system here in Texas and i have a real concern with about that
sw2383B-ms98-a-0012 121.370375 133.478750 um um matter of fact i'm very content to send my daughter ou[t]- out of state to college in in Virginia uh verses having her go down here and not learn anything and then uh so i'm
sw2383B-ms98-a-0013 133.478750 141.914125 my my opinion i thi[nk]- i think there's a big concern uh hope[fully]- hopefully the new uh education secretary of education will do something to fix the problem but uh
sw2383B-ms98-a-0014 141.914125 151.547875 i don't know they got to quit worrying about uh the uh religious uh overtones in our textbooks and get on with teaching the product

sw2383B-ms98-a-0019 178.873000 191.484000 ha[lf]- they don't even a lot of the school systems don't even uh the kids nowadays don't even know what what the President's uh Fitness Education Program's all about they don't have to do sit-ups and push-ups and all that crap we had to do when we were going to school
