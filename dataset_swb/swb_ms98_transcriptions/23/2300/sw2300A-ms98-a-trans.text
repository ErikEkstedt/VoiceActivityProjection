sw2300A-ms98-a-0032 118.324875 125.578125 that's funny yeah we have a we're twenty eight and he's been working at TI for five years
sw2300A-ms98-a-0033 125.578125 138.116750 and that was pretty much his first really really major job of any you know professional because_1 he'd worked you know part time during school and what not and uh he was a little late graduating so we're
sw2300A-ms98-a-0034 138.116750 147.712875 you know uh and we have a nine and a half year old son and it's because_1 you know we were eighteen when we had him so we're we're kind of looking at this from the other aspect of
sw2300A-ms98-a-0035 147.712875 161.886750 we you know we have a lot for to be our age and you know just everything and having the responsibilities we've had on us for at such a young age you know we have a like a nice house people you know are really shocked at how nice everything is in our house
sw2300A-ms98-a-0036 161.886750 172.470000 but we don't you know live in a brand new house either maybe an eighty ninety hundred thousand dollar house we live in a thirty year old house that would probably sell for forty five thousand
sw2300A-ms98-a-0037 172.470000 182.147750 so you know we have trade-offs so we're more we have a monthly budget with this this this this but we have no savings which isn't real wise but
sw2300A-ms98-a-0038 182.147750 191.943625 we just we don't have the income at this time really to have any because_1 we have um three debts that we're trying to pay off from both of our student loans we're still paying trying to pay those off
sw2300A-ms98-a-0039 191.943625 197.909250 and we have one car payment that we're [vocalized-noise] i think we have about thirteen months left on it
sw2300A-ms98-a-0040 197.909250 203.252625 and after that we either what we want to do is begin doubling up our car payment
sw2300A-ms98-a-0041 203.252625 212.262125 um they'll pay [vocalized-noise] our car payment is equivalent to both of our student loans so what we want to do is next year keep driving the same cars
sw2300A-ms98-a-0042 212.262125 222.853875 and um pay on the student loans split that car payment in half and pay you know double up payments on both our loans and it'll work out perfect

sw2300A-ms98-a-0073 295.695250 309.562500 see we got ripped off buying our new car we both come out of uh drugs and stuff and we became Christians about five years ago right when right when he got hired for TI right before he got hired for TI he'd uh gotten saved and stuff
sw2300A-ms98-a-0074 309.562500 314.265125 and so i mean when you get come out of drugs and stuff you have nothing i mean you know you don't have anything
sw2300A-ms98-a-0075 314.265125 327.797750 you have the clothes on your back and you might have a car and that kind of thing and so when he when he started working at TI we uh you know we really felt like God told us to buy a new car because he had an older car that was going to need to be fixed and high gas
sw2300A-ms98-a-0076 327.797750 340.186500 but we got ripped off on it because we wanted it financed at four years and we were young and we'd look about nineteen people still think we're about they ask us where we go to high school when we get our hair cut and stuff both of us
sw2300A-ms98-a-0077 340.186500 345.774750 and so it's just kind of strange you know so five years ago we probably looked like real ding dongs you know
sw2300A-ms98-a-0078 345.774750 360.061375 so we went in and they financed the car for five and we didn't know that we got kind of taken just a little bit so we're kind of upset that we're having to you know pay this fifth year on the car because it was just not a wise thing but we learned a good lesson so
sw2300A-ms98-a-0079 360.061375 361.070000 you know
sw2300A-ms98-a-0080 361.070000 367.279875 [silence]
sw2300A-ms98-a-0081 367.279875 370.869375 yeah but they they would have only been about twenty dollars a month higher
sw2300A-ms98-a-0082 370.869375 381.643250 and he want yeah he just told me this last week that he he said don't you remember i asked them to finance it at four years and they came back and they said that they had it figured for five and we'd already signed the papers
sw2300A-ms98-a-0083 381.643250 389.097250 and i maybe i might have been there i don't remember hearing that but i also wasn't the one in charge of it so i wasn't paying as close of attention
sw2300A-ms98-a-0084 389.097250 403.671125 but anyway instead of putting our foot down about it we just went okay whatever you know so anyway so next time we'll do that different we want to next time pay cash for our car too we want to pay cash for everything we can possibly do when we buy a house
sw2300A-ms98-a-0085 403.671125 416.256875 we attended a Bill Guathier financial seminar and he has a lot of wisdom on that just on Biblical you know principles to finance he runs a big the largest real estate company in Fort Worth debt free
sw2300A-ms98-a-0086 416.256875 431.184625 and we really believe in debt free living and debt free car buying and debt free house buying and if we do take out a loan on a house in the future what we'll do is pay twice a twice a month on it and because you save a lot in interest just doing that
sw2300A-ms98-a-0087 431.184625 432.836000 and then

sw2300A-ms98-a-0115 520.991625 527.324625 and so we're going to use people that we're in a relationship with that we know that you know we know are people of integrity so
sw2300A-ms98-a-0116 527.324625 541.721625 you know that is another thing that you know we feel like our long term goal [laughter-is] going to be benefitted by next time we buy a car we're not just going to go to Toyota of Irving you know we're going to go to somebody that we know we're going to take someone with us older and we didn't do any of those things

sw2300A-ms98-a-0125 582.186000 589.797500 and we just stopped payment on the check so i hope they don't sue us over it [laughter] but we never received any merchandise either so i don't think it would hold any
