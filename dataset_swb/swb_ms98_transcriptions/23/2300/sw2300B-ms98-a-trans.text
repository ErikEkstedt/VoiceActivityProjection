sw2300B-ms98-a-0027 226.408125 231.066625 okay thing about the credit union is it's the way it's set up is if you have
sw2300B-ms98-a-0028 231.066625 232.496500 [silence]
sw2300B-ms98-a-0029 232.496500 240.276000 two thousand dollars left let's say on on the loan if you go up there and write them a two thousand dollar check it doesn't all go towards principal
sw2300B-ms98-a-0030 240.276000 250.651250 they take out for the for the finances the finance charge which is kind of you know so it's like one of these lose or swim type of credit one of those loans [vocalized-noise] not really the best in the world but
sw2300B-ms98-a-0031 250.651250 263.724500 but you know they['re]- they're uh since your husband is is is um uh a TIer but doesn't have the loans with the credit union they're offering something that might be worth taking a gander at i don't know what your percent is on your on your car payments
sw2300B-ms98-a-0032 263.724500 272.669625 but they are they'll take any TI non credit union loan like if you have a fourteen percent loan for a new car they'll take it
sw2300B-ms98-a-0033 272.669625 278.522750 and refinance it and put it with Texas Credit Union at i think it's a ten and a quarter percent
sw2300B-ms98-a-0034 278.522750 284.825375 which is not a bad deal one of the secretaries we have down here is is paying twelve percent through GMAC or something
sw2300B-ms98-a-0035 284.825375 286.969625 and she's doing it i mean it's not like it's like
sw2300B-ms98-a-0036 286.969625 287.956375 [silence]
sw2300B-ms98-a-0037 287.956375 296.193375 i think they even cover that because they want you as a uh uh they want the TIer to be part of the credit union

sw2300B-ms98-a-0053 433.381125 438.872500 if if if if and you need to be very careful
sw2300B-ms98-a-0054 438.872500 453.660000 if the loan is set up to have bi[monthly]- they call it a yuppie loan if it's set up for bimonthly payments if you because you'll save se[venteen]- fifteen to seventeen years off the end of the loan sev[en]- i'm sorry seven to nine years off the end of the loan
sw2300B-ms98-a-0055 453.660000 460.807375 and there are there is a local firm that'll actually if if like in my situation i don't have that because the loan was not available
sw2300B-ms98-a-0056 460.807375 471.160000 i can ha[ve]- this firm will pick up my loan for a six hundred fifty dollar fee so i can cut that much off the end of but i'm not interested because we're moving out of the house next year
sw2300B-ms98-a-0057 471.160000 476.092125 yeah but uh [vocalized-noise] those are all great the the interesting thing we're getting ready to have a house built
sw2300B-ms98-a-0058 476.092125 484.425250 is it's not a lot of the firms that offer mor[tgage]- mortgage loan firms aren't offering um that loan
sw2300B-ms98-a-0059 484.425250 493.839125 i mean you can ask and you can wheel and deal but it's not as open as it it should be it's a great idea hell i'd love to cut ours in half but uh man
sw2300B-ms98-a-0060 493.839125 502.485250 and if you figure get with a financial person and you can figure up exactly when like the eighteenth month of a loan if you make like a four hundred dollar payment
sw2300B-ms98-a-0061 502.485250 511.131250 over and above your house payment it'll make uh it has a magic with numbers it i it'll shave almost you know X number of dollars off [vocalized-noise]
