sw2394A-ms98-a-0008 58.473000 60.755875 hm
sw2394A-ms98-a-0009 60.755875 70.221750 so you're saying that the coalition forces should've got went ahead and uh gone in and taken out uh Iraq instead of just recapturing Kuwait
sw2394A-ms98-a-0010 70.221750 71.779375 [silence]
sw2394A-ms98-a-0011 71.779375 81.734500 yeah and well bad thing is i mean you can't do that because the the Saudis asked you know the Saudis were were helping you know out
sw2394A-ms98-a-0012 81.734500 89.498250 on only under the condition that they would help that the United States and the coalition force would help Kuwait regain their country
sw2394A-ms98-a-0013 89.498250 93.496500 and other[wise]- otherwise otherwise
sw2394A-ms98-a-0014 93.496500 95.740625 [silence]
sw2394A-ms98-a-0015 95.740625 97.279500 right

sw2394A-ms98-a-0017 99.789500 104.326750 and plus you know it's illegal you know in uh
sw2394A-ms98-a-0018 104.326750 109.702000 in uh warfare or any t[ype]- or any other kind of uh international
sw2394A-ms98-a-0019 109.702000 110.749875 [silence]
sw2394A-ms98-a-0020 110.749875 121.979250 to go against the to exactly you can't go after the the leader you can't legally do that i mean then again you know there's people who say war is war everything's fair
sw2394A-ms98-a-0021 121.979250 129.482750 but that's just not it's it's like some you know a Geneva convention or something like that said it
sw2394A-ms98-a-0022 129.482750 135.274125 [silence]
sw2394A-ms98-a-0023 135.274125 136.690500 uh-huh

sw2394A-ms98-a-0027 142.492125 144.264750 but
sw2394A-ms98-a-0028 144.264750 157.416125 yeah it's it's but it's it's it's it's very hard to deal with people that don't bel[ieve]- don't believe in the same things and don't live the same way that you do you know it's like as we think that
sw2394A-ms98-a-0029 157.416125 161.967500 Saddam Hussein ruined the country and that
sw2394A-ms98-a-0030 161.967500 169.498875 that that Iraq would be much better with a democracy so that the people could decide what they want
sw2394A-ms98-a-0031 169.498875 184.385375 but then again you got you have all the Palestinians that that think that this Saddam Hussein is is a you know is a God is i[s]- is someone that's going to relieve them of all their troubles and how can you get across to people that
sw2394A-ms98-a-0032 184.385375 188.589625 think that you know their savior you're telling them_1 that their savior
sw2394A-ms98-a-0033 188.589625 199.936750 is a person of empty promises you can't you know it's hard it's hard to do that so it's hard to change a diff[erent]- a country especially in the Middle East which has different views on life
sw2394A-ms98-a-0034 199.936750 206.680500 [silence]
sw2394A-ms98-a-0035 206.680500 209.783750 getting him out yeah

sw2394A-ms98-a-0038 225.720500 227.475875 [silence]
sw2394A-ms98-a-0039 227.475875 242.306000 i think i think the United States should uh stick around and play a role but i don't think that United States should uh get directly involved from now on they should kind of stay stay on the outside of uh
sw2394A-ms98-a-0040 242.306000 244.429375 of the events you know kind of
sw2394A-ms98-a-0041 244.429375 254.467625 i don't know how to say i[t]- how to say it exactly in words but you know just kind of stay with one eye looking in the situation make sure that
sw2394A-ms98-a-0042 254.467625 265.497750 United States can go in when need be you know it's not like uh uh tha[t]- we'll be ready if they ever ask for help
sw2394A-ms98-a-0043 265.497750 274.744000 [silence]
sw2394A-ms98-a-0044 274.744000 275.998625 uh-huh

sw2394A-ms98-a-0047 281.487625 294.496000 [silence]
sw2394A-ms98-a-0048 294.496000 297.617125 so there's already some trouble brewing huh
sw2394A-ms98-a-0049 297.617125 299.498250 [silence]
sw2394A-ms98-a-0050 299.498250 301.229750 yeah
sw2394A-ms98-a-0051 301.229750 312.724625 [silence]
sw2394A-ms98-a-0052 312.724625 314.496375 yeah
sw2394A-ms98-a-0053 314.496375 319.498625 [silence]
sw2394A-ms98-a-0054 319.498625 321.926250 you mean after the cease fire
sw2394A-ms98-a-0055 321.926250 323.584250 well i think
sw2394A-ms98-a-0056 323.584250 327.984625 [silence]
sw2394A-ms98-a-0057 327.984625 337.758625 yeah the well i think uh they they also shot down some gunships is that what you're talking about the the uh helicopter gun ships that that they shot down
sw2394A-ms98-a-0058 337.758625 343.450000 [silence]
sw2394A-ms98-a-0059 343.450000 355.478000 because uh what i heard was that the that the the military was was uh shooting down civilians and and um anti Hussein
sw2394A-ms98-a-0060 355.478000 358.754375 troops with gun ships
sw2394A-ms98-a-0061 358.754375 362.998000 [silence]
sw2394A-ms98-a-0062 362.998000 371.986625 it's a mess it's hard it's hard for two different societies to get together and and try to help each other mutually when they don't agree on so many things
sw2394A-ms98-a-0063 371.986625 384.890500 and then you know and then and especially with the Middle East the way it is they the too -[in]sane you know these these the Arabs are fighting amongst themselves and then one Arab decides to ask
sw2394A-ms98-a-0064 384.890500 396.923875 a non Arab for help and that just kind of turns everybody else against them_1 like you know that's why the Palestinians were were rooting for or were pulling for Hussein because they're all Arabs
sw2394A-ms98-a-0065 396.923875 397.986625 [silence]
sw2394A-ms98-a-0066 397.986625 404.738000 and they really didn't like the idea of the United States coming in and helping out Kuwait who was so rich
sw2394A-ms98-a-0067 404.738000 407.465875 [silence]
sw2394A-ms98-a-0068 407.465875 408.974750 yeah
sw2394A-ms98-a-0069 408.974750 419.483500 [silence]
sw2394A-ms98-a-0070 419.483500 420.969000 yeah
sw2394A-ms98-a-0071 420.969000 425.721500 [silence]
sw2394A-ms98-a-0072 425.721500 426.990000 oh well
sw2394A-ms98-a-0073 426.990000 433.483250 [silence]
sw2394A-ms98-a-0074 433.483250 436.258250 yeah i think we did the right thing
sw2394A-ms98-a-0075 436.258250 439.307625 [silence]
sw2394A-ms98-a-0076 439.307625 440.726625 right
sw2394A-ms98-a-0077 440.726625 446.750000 [silence]
sw2394A-ms98-a-0078 446.750000 456.278625 well i think it deterred i think it deterred Hussein from doing anything else because if w[e]- if for example we we let Hussein go in there and take Kuwait then
sw2394A-ms98-a-0079 456.278625 466.706000 it could have been just like uh you know World War Two be[cause]- it may you know because Hitler got little bit of what he wanted here he'd try it again and got some more he'd try again and got some more
sw2394A-ms98-a-0080 466.706000 470.473125 [silence]
sw2394A-ms98-a-0081 470.473125 471.986625 right
sw2394A-ms98-a-0082 471.986625 483.500000 [silence]
sw2394A-ms98-a-0083 483.500000 485.290750 right
sw2394A-ms98-a-0084 485.290750 491.223375 [silence]
sw2394A-ms98-a-0085 491.223375 494.473250 yeah yeah
sw2394A-ms98-a-0086 494.473250 510.981250 [silence]
sw2394A-ms98-a-0087 510.981250 515.175875 yeah because they don't have anything to lose so they'll go ahead and use them_1
sw2394A-ms98-a-0088 515.175875 522.745500 [silence]
sw2394A-ms98-a-0089 522.745500 524.235125 um-hum
sw2394A-ms98-a-0090 524.235125 534.965250 but they have less to lose if they use them_1 you know it's like they're they're third world countries they you know they they're like their their people are in bad shape well we'll go ahead and use it and
sw2394A-ms98-a-0091 534.965250 538.998875 put some other country in our shape see that's the way they think
sw2394A-ms98-a-0092 538.998875 540.627125 so
sw2394A-ms98-a-0093 540.627125 541.996750 yeah
sw2394A-ms98-a-0094 541.996750 543.502375 [silence]
sw2394A-ms98-a-0095 543.502375 550.968750 it'll be interesting to see how it turns out now you know who who does what if Hussein actually stays in power or not
sw2394A-ms98-a-0096 550.968750 558.984625 [silence]
sw2394A-ms98-a-0097 558.984625 560.730000 yeah
