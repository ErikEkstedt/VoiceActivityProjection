sw2394B-ms98-a-0002 10.947125 25.498875 well i i think it's been interesting to hear you know about the overall outlook you know before we ended the war what implications we'd be dealing with uh you know the
sw2394B-ms98-a-0003 25.498875 30.348625 strong religious beliefs and uh you know it's just another
sw2394B-ms98-a-0004 30.348625 42.996125 uh attitude you know and what we are really getting into and and the fact that that that war you know coalition forces stuck together uh and uh
sw2394B-ms98-a-0005 42.996125 48.994000 you know i just think now is that they shou[ld]- they should have finished Saddam off because i think
sw2394B-ms98-a-0006 48.994000 62.496375 we're just going to see re[percussions]- repercu[ssions]- repercussions down the line because he's he'll probably maintained power it sounds like he's uh you know uh knocked down the revolt you know so
sw2394B-ms98-a-0007 62.496375 69.960375 [silence]
sw2394B-ms98-a-0008 69.960375 72.213750 or at least got Saddam
sw2394B-ms98-a-0009 72.213750 75.464625 you know if they you know if they
sw2394B-ms98-a-0010 75.464625 88.989500 [silence]
sw2394B-ms98-a-0011 88.989500 101.489750 yeah no i i don't think i don't i don't think a lot of them_1 didn't want him to lose con[trol]- you know power completely but it's hard to say um
sw2394B-ms98-a-0012 101.489750 109.474250 [silence]
sw2394B-ms98-a-0013 109.474250 114.441750 yeah to go a[gainst]- to go after the political heads of state but
sw2394B-ms98-a-0014 114.441750 115.974625 [silence]
sw2394B-ms98-a-0015 115.974625 117.498625 yeah

sw2394B-ms98-a-0019 130.718250 139.982500 anyway but now it looks like uh you know Kuwait has asked us to defend its borders more of a permanent type of basis which will be a first
sw2394B-ms98-a-0020 139.982500 141.977500 uh
sw2394B-ms98-a-0021 141.977500 145.967625 so it's interesting uh uh

sw2394B-ms98-a-0026 198.465625 205.652375 yeah i don't know if the in[terested]- yeah United States is interested as much as establishing a democracy
sw2394B-ms98-a-0027 205.652375 210.946125 as opposed to just getting rid of Saddam you know it just uh
sw2394B-ms98-a-0028 210.946125 214.989125 but you know we'll see if if anything if he
sw2394B-ms98-a-0029 214.989125 228.492000 if he gets stability uh and he doesn't you know get knocked off you know by a coup or something down the line you know what happens you know down the road i just uh it'll be interesting
sw2394B-ms98-a-0030 228.492000 237.961875 [silence]
sw2394B-ms98-a-0031 237.961875 240.498375 yeah [noise]

sw2394B-ms98-a-0037 262.496750 264.678125 yeah well it's interesting
sw2394B-ms98-a-0038 264.678125 275.484125 yeah interesting there's like a two square m[ile]- mile area that's occupied by some Iraqi soldiers and Kuwait's saying it's their land
sw2394B-ms98-a-0039 275.484125 282.498000 and they have the their line of demarcation is that what they call it uh
sw2394B-ms98-a-0040 282.498000 294.262125 and they've already outlined that for the cease fire and uh apparently we don't want to deal with that but the Kuwaitis want this [laughter-la[nd]-] want these th[is]- th[is]- this land back that they're saying it's theirs
sw2394B-ms98-a-0041 294.262125 308.277250 so tha[t]- that was kind of interesting that we said that we said no we're not going to get involved you know we've already established you know the line of cease fire do you you know and the uh demarcation line so
sw2394B-ms98-a-0042 308.277250 321.044000 um they were definitely trying to avoid any hostilities i thought it was interesting though that we did kn[ock]- uh shoot down some of their airplanes when they went up but i don't think they're doing that anymore
sw2394B-ms98-a-0043 321.044000 329.681625 yeah yeah well well well they warned them_1 th[ey]- we t[old]- we told them_1 we would this is after that c[ease]- the cease fire so
sw2394B-ms98-a-0044 329.681625 337.986125 [silence]
sw2394B-ms98-a-0045 337.986125 344.679500 i don't know maybe they were helicopters i thought they were airpl[anes]- i thought they were letting the helicopters fly around a[nd]- a[nd]-
sw2394B-ms98-a-0046 344.679500 356.749750 [silence]

sw2394B-ms98-a-0056 410.679250 413.984500 but obviously i think it was
sw2394B-ms98-a-0057 413.984500 415.735250 [silence]
sw2394B-ms98-a-0058 415.735250 419.971875 in[fluenced]- influ[enced]- you know the heads of state obviously you know
sw2394B-ms98-a-0059 419.971875 424.497250 you know the ones that uh let us in but uh
sw2394B-ms98-a-0060 424.497250 425.501500 [silence]
sw2394B-ms98-a-0061 425.501500 430.983875 it['s]- i[t's]- it's that's anyway i would think uh
sw2394B-ms98-a-0062 430.983875 433.718750 yeah i think it was good that w[e]-
sw2394B-ms98-a-0063 433.718750 436.983750 th[at]- that we got that you know that
sw2394B-ms98-a-0064 436.983750 440.492875 you know we drew the line somewhere
sw2394B-ms98-a-0065 440.492875 444.499625 and uh whether that uh
sw2394B-ms98-a-0066 444.499625 448.979625 you know what effect it has in the long run y[ou]- you know to be all right
sw2394B-ms98-a-0067 448.979625 459.467875 [silence]
sw2394B-ms98-a-0068 459.467875 462.453125 um-hum and i and i think
sw2394B-ms98-a-0069 462.453125 465.498375 [silence]
sw2394B-ms98-a-0070 465.498375 470.750000 yeah i the think you know it'll deter the next person from
sw2394B-ms98-a-0071 470.750000 477.058125 you know uh thinking the same types of things but i think the problem is that we'll never get away from
sw2394B-ms98-a-0072 477.058125 485.156375 the expansion idea i mean you know we're terr[itory]- we're territory in general we're going to run into another you know uh
sw2394B-ms98-a-0073 485.156375 496.221500 i don't want to go so far and say it's a Hitler but crap Saddam seems like he's as bad as Hitler almost by the way you know they torture and kill people y[ou]- you know from what you read but uh
sw2394B-ms98-a-0074 496.221500 502.242375 you know once the nuclear power y[ou]- you know nuclear uh
sw2394B-ms98-a-0075 502.242375 511.185250 you know bombs uh get in the hands of some of these other countries uh for them to you know who knows uh
sw2394B-ms98-a-0076 511.185250 514.003500 who may try what down the road
sw2394B-ms98-a-0077 514.003500 515.208375 [silence]
sw2394B-ms98-a-0078 515.208375 525.476000 yeah that's another thing is that they you know they just they don't understand implications i don't think or or may or may not but um
sw2394B-ms98-a-0079 525.476000 537.987250 [silence]
sw2394B-ms98-a-0080 537.987250 546.294750 yeah well we'll see and you know it has i mo[st]- i may fairly young here i got to
sw2394B-ms98-a-0081 546.294750 551.518500 [silence]
sw2394B-ms98-a-0082 551.518500 565.765875 they keep saying they think [noise] he won't make it but it looks like he's you know taking control of all these cities that were uh besieged by the rebels but sounds like he's gotten control and 
sw2394B-ms98-a-0083 565.765875 573.460625 you know it's just a matter if if he can survive you know without somebody else you know a coup attempt or something
sw2394B-ms98-a-0084 573.460625 574.775625 um
sw2394B-ms98-a-0085 574.775625 578.266375 [silence]
