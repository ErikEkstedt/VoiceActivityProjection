sw2340A-ms98-a-0034 143.526500 147.703750 she's happy as as heck uh and they they have serve meals of course 
sw2340A-ms98-a-0035 147.703750 152.073000 and they have clubs and a swimming pool so that's nice now i
sw2340A-ms98-a-0036 152.073000 159.326125 i know the ones where you're really ill we visited a long time ago when she had a grandmother that was in one
sw2340A-ms98-a-0037 159.326125 165.784375 and they were all more or less hospitalized type you know really really sick it's a tough question
sw2340A-ms98-a-0038 165.784375 168.724375 [silence]
sw2340A-ms98-a-0039 168.724375 171.567375 oh you got ex[perience]- more experience than i do then on it

sw2340A-ms98-a-0043 182.430000 185.956625 oh that would be awful i never thought about that you know
sw2340A-ms98-a-0044 185.956625 190.170750 [silence]
sw2340A-ms98-a-0045 190.170750 191.581125 um-hum
sw2340A-ms98-a-0046 191.581125 205.656500 [silence]
sw2340A-ms98-a-0047 205.656500 211.225625 yeah i think that uh hopefully we as a country are learning a little more about it and they're getting nicer
sw2340A-ms98-a-0048 211.225625 225.232875 i've seen on TV where they take animals and young children in fact my daughter is one my wife took my daughters one year when they were getting some points for school took them to an elderly home and and boy that really pumps them up that uh 
sw2340A-ms98-a-0049 225.232875 230.554500 is very nice to see young people i think that's one of the sad things is when you're in an older home
sw2340A-ms98-a-0050 230.554500 236.756000 if you just have people your own age you never get a chance to see kids or anything or animals or anything you know you can't take care of them
sw2340A-ms98-a-0051 236.756000 243.206500 ob[vious]- obvious you can't take care of children or animals in a nursing home but it's nice to have them_1 visit and everything
sw2340A-ms98-a-0052 243.206500 245.241875 yeah
sw2340A-ms98-a-0053 245.241875 253.050250 [silence]
sw2340A-ms98-a-0054 253.050250 254.672125 right
sw2340A-ms98-a-0055 254.672125 271.856250 [silence]
sw2340A-ms98-a-0056 271.856250 279.730250 yeah i think you do get more by stimul[ation]- stimulation my in fact my mother-in-law just visited she's just about seventy five again perfectly fine
sw2340A-ms98-a-0057 279.730250 283.433875 but one and and she visit us here in in Dallas
sw2340A-ms98-a-0058 283.433875 297.647125 when she went back every time she goes back to uh San Antonio [vocalized-noise] my wife has two sisters there too she said she's much better she's much more alive and and uh active when she's been on a visit with somebody else you know and 
sw2340A-ms98-a-0059 297.647125 311.419500 and our routine has come obviously hectic with teenagers and everything and she's much and so the stimulation part is really important i think like any animal anything you just lay around uh that's the fastest way to die i think you know
sw2340A-ms98-a-0060 311.419500 318.428750 [silence]
sw2340A-ms98-a-0061 318.428750 326.781500 oh yeah i'm afraid i'm a TV flipper anything bad i like i like to flip [laughter-i] flip it off but it is sad it's sad yeah 
sw2340A-ms98-a-0062 326.781500 333.158625 [silence]
sw2340A-ms98-a-0063 333.158625 334.890000 oh yeah
sw2340A-ms98-a-0064 334.890000 346.321750 [silence]
sw2340A-ms98-a-0065 346.321750 348.012500 yeah
sw2340A-ms98-a-0066 348.012500 351.715625 [silence]
sw2340A-ms98-a-0067 351.715625 355.948125 right when i was uh younger we i lived in the east i'm from the east really
sw2340A-ms98-a-0068 355.948125 363.107000 and it seemed like there several people that i knew that had their uh parents i guess they would be but well in their seventy living with them_1
sw2340A-ms98-a-0069 363.107000 372.861500 and one of them was even a woman who was fairly old and i guess she she had her own separate room and i think whether it's more a custom up there or maybe because_1 i was younger and it's just not a custom anymore
sw2340A-ms98-a-0070 372.861500 380.451625 to have uh you know the grandparents live with you anymore i guess that uh well we are getting away from that which is not right
sw2340A-ms98-a-0071 380.451625 383.533500 [silence]
sw2340A-ms98-a-0072 383.533500 385.046375 oh yeah
sw2340A-ms98-a-0073 385.046375 388.193625 [silence]

sw2340A-ms98-a-0080 407.997375 410.468500 well that's nice in a lot of ways
sw2340A-ms98-a-0081 410.468500 413.518375 [silence]
sw2340A-ms98-a-0082 413.518375 416.849625 but that you were [vocalized-noise] you said that by mistake yeah right 
sw2340A-ms98-a-0083 416.849625 424.892250 that's what i think about it for me i think well my kids better not do that to me i don't want that you know so i- i think of it well how would i want to be treated rather than
sw2340A-ms98-a-0084 424.892250 433.604125 you know it's easy to say well yeah let's let's put these old folks in a home but when i think i don't want to do that you know i don't want to be have my little home i always threaten my daughters i say well
sw2340A-ms98-a-0085 433.604125 442.165125 i'm going to build a little house behind yours and then and i'll take care of your lawn he says but i'm not going to one of those places right yeah
sw2340A-ms98-a-0086 442.165125 444.617750 [silence]
sw2340A-ms98-a-0087 444.617750 446.576500 [laughter]
sw2340A-ms98-a-0088 446.576500 458.900125 that's what we that's the way we call it which is really wrong but my wife's mother and the one she's in San Ant[onio]- it's you know it's everything but the opposite of what you've seen i mean it's uh it's a little ho[tel]- hotel you might say and 
sw2340A-ms98-a-0089 458.900125 461.788125 again a swimming pool and grounds
sw2340A-ms98-a-0090 461.788125 467.071125 and she has enough room she has two bedrooms and a and a separate living area
sw2340A-ms98-a-0091 467.071125 471.566250 they don't have kitchens or anything but they have little it's like uh
sw2340A-ms98-a-0092 471.566250 477.336000 on each floor they have a little kitchen area where you can go down and have a make a meal you know
sw2340A-ms98-a-0093 477.336000 479.602875 [silence]
sw2340A-ms98-a-0094 479.602875 485.258000 oh yeah it's it's it's nothing like that it's like living in the hotel i mean she's totally on her own
sw2340A-ms98-a-0095 485.258000 491.560000 uh and she still drives which we do does scare us some because she has dented a few things you know
sw2340A-ms98-a-0096 491.560000 504.532000 and we keep thinking about that you know because_1 she they get less alert and they don't care and i've seen some of these elderly people on TV you know the ones from Florida that just run into people and they don't even understand what happened you know
sw2340A-ms98-a-0097 504.532000 506.363000 [silence]
sw2340A-ms98-a-0098 506.363000 507.704375 i know
sw2340A-ms98-a-0099 507.704375 515.249125 [silence]
sw2340A-ms98-a-0100 515.249125 518.128625 i- i know go ahead i'm sorry
sw2340A-ms98-a-0101 518.128625 520.972500 [silence]
sw2340A-ms98-a-0102 520.972500 522.710000 oh he still drives
sw2340A-ms98-a-0103 522.710000 527.447750 that's gr[eat]- well it's wonderful in one one respect but i don't know if you can afford the insurance yeah
sw2340A-ms98-a-0104 527.447750 530.139750 [silence]
sw2340A-ms98-a-0105 530.139750 531.588750 yeah

sw2340A-ms98-a-0109 539.017375 541.954250 that's good i mean people are all different
sw2340A-ms98-a-0110 541.954250 552.949500 i- i wonder if they should give them_1 a test or at least maybe uh not take their license maybe give them_1 a refresher driving course and just to just to see how well they are every five years
sw2340A-ms98-a-0111 552.949500 554.890500 are they doing it
sw2340A-ms98-a-0112 554.890500 568.163375 [silence]
sw2340A-ms98-a-0113 568.163375 569.709500 yeah
sw2340A-ms98-a-0114 569.709500 573.209250 well everybody needs retraining it doesn't hurt uh
sw2340A-ms98-a-0115 573.209250 578.414625 you know [vocalized-noise] best football players and all the opera singers still have coaches and i don't know why you couldn't 
sw2340A-ms98-a-0116 578.414625 588.724250 after sixty five every five years have a refresher course and then take another driving it would it would sure the insurance companies would would probably help pay for some of that you know
sw2340A-ms98-a-0117 588.724250 591.070000 [silence]
sw2340A-ms98-a-0118 591.070000 594.934875 right there you go there's a good point very good point
sw2340A-ms98-a-0119 594.934875 600.191500 very good point but i think they nee[d]- [vocalized-noise] should do that and then the families will have said
