sw2339B-ms98-a-0022 83.143250 86.584125 [noise] sometimes we get a lot of people together to do it
sw2339B-ms98-a-0023 86.584125 93.164375 and we've done things like when when it's kind of cold we take extension cords and we've all got heaters in our tents 
sw2339B-ms98-a-0024 93.164375 99.301000 and in the [laughter-summer] same thing we get our extension cords running from all these tents but we've got the fans going
sw2339B-ms98-a-0025 99.301000 104.867625 so we're not roughing it too much and we have taken TVs out there for the [laughter-kids]

sw2339B-ms98-a-0045 174.925375 181.412250 and decided we were going to tent most of the way and it ended up when it came time for us to pull in for the night
sw2339B-ms98-a-0046 181.412250 186.259000 we'd take a vote and most of the time we decided we wanted to stay in a hotel
sw2339B-ms98-a-0047 186.259000 189.007875 instead of getting out all that stuff you know
