sw2306A-ms98-a-0068 262.318750 272.986625 yeah but uh i can't get too enthused about it yet it seems to me i have to feel that the fall weather to really do something uh with regard to football
sw2306A-ms98-a-0069 272.986625 274.745000 [silence]
sw2306A-ms98-a-0070 274.745000 287.996000 yeah i because_1 i always hate to see it end in January i'd like to see it go on for a couple of months but football to me uh in real real hot weather it just doesn't uh doesn't click now i enjoy
sw2306A-ms98-a-0071 287.996000 299.258625 going to baseball games but i don't enjoy watching them on television and i don't enjoy watching basketball on television they're they're both well baseball's so slow
sw2306A-ms98-a-0072 299.258625 307.491625 and uh basketball seems like all all that you can really see is run and shoot run and shoot run and [laughter-shoot] and um 
sw2306A-ms98-a-0073 307.491625 315.458250 uh because the average person doesn't get to see enough of the entire floor to see a play get uh de[velop]- develop
sw2306A-ms98-a-0074 315.458250 329.996000 and so uh uh i don't usually watch them i'll listen to baseball and i'll listen to uh like the Indianapolis Five Hundred i would not go and face all those crowds for anything in the [laughter-world] 
sw2306A-ms98-a-0075 329.996000 342.755000 but uh but uh no i won't watch it i'll listen to it on the radio yeah while i'm doing something else but i won't sit still long enough to watch them go round and around and around to me that is very boring
sw2306A-ms98-a-0076 342.755000 347.754500 but i- i don't watch i don't sit and watch for long periods of time anyhow
sw2306A-ms98-a-0077 347.754500 350.495250 [silence]

sw2306A-ms98-a-0090 396.494875 403.707875 well and i think that's maybe what i like about it in that so many of them are totally enclosed
sw2306A-ms98-a-0091 403.707875 407.457125 oh i well i have and they're very noisy
sw2306A-ms98-a-0092 407.457125 421.487375 and uh then of course i've been up to uh Cleveland Ohio where the Cleveland Browns play and that's just a wide open stadium and that cold wind comes off the lakes and it is miserable oh
sw2306A-ms98-a-0093 421.487375 429.983750 but um now go down to Cincinnati and they have a nice stadium down there but it's it's all open also
