sw2308A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.456250 [noise]
sw2308A-ms98-a-0002 0.456250 10.493750 so [noise] um well i'll tell you my situation is uh i have an elderly grandmother that we did just recently put in a nursing home
sw2308A-ms98-a-0003 10.493750 14.211625 and um her son which is my father
sw2308A-ms98-a-0004 14.211625 27.497000 is also elderly and this is one of the reasons why she had to go to the nursing home is that she was literally driving him nuts in his later years now my father's almost eighty my grandmother's almost ninety seven
sw2308A-ms98-a-0005 27.497000 29.748500 so um
sw2308A-ms98-a-0006 29.748500 35.688875 it's strange because it it so hit so close to home
sw2308A-ms98-a-0007 35.688875 47.678000 but um um my father's an only child and really me and my sister are the only ones that will deal with my grandmother she had many sisters and a couple of them took care of her
sw2308A-ms98-a-0008 47.678000 51.222625 and then one her last sister died and it was
sw2308A-ms98-a-0009 51.222625 58.345625 probably seven or eight months after that she had to go in a nursing home because i was pretty much giving up my life my sister was
sw2308A-ms98-a-0010 58.345625 70.488125 and plus she was driving my father crazy she went through three housekeepers live-in housekeepers so she's kind of cranky to get along with there's nothing physically wrong with her except she's very very old
sw2308A-ms98-a-0011 70.488125 79.991750 but her personality is is very grating [laughter] i mean i hope i don't get like that when i get old so
sw2308A-ms98-a-0012 79.991750 140.940625 [silence]
sw2308A-ms98-a-0013 140.940625 145.085000 yeah you don't know if their complaints are legitimate
sw2308A-ms98-a-0014 145.085000 155.802125 um we don't have that problem up here we might maybe in a rural uh maybe there's a bad uh a bad home in a rural area but it would be a very small one
sw2308A-ms98-a-0015 155.802125 167.237375 um the one my grandmother's in is very um hospital like there were some really nice ones here all the a lot of the nursing homes around here have very good reputations
sw2308A-ms98-a-0016 167.237375 179.256500 um this one is [vocalized-noise] more or less for someone who who's poor and can't go there and my father's is he's no by no means wealthy but he's quite well off 
sw2308A-ms98-a-0017 179.256500 190.185250 and he could he could easily have put her into a nicer um home but up here there's waiting lists and that was the first one that opened and i suggested to him why don't you change
sw2308A-ms98-a-0018 190.185250 200.492875 um he said well these people here are they are very nice to her and he was saying his excuses if you move her some place else the people might not be so nice
sw2308A-ms98-a-0019 200.492875 208.268625 so the the professionals in the nursing homes really have to want to do what their doing because it's a really trying job
sw2308A-ms98-a-0020 208.268625 221.952625 i mean i go up twice a week to see my grandmother and i know the staff very well so they couldn't they can't hide anything on you or anything like that but i have heard of really awful conditions
sw2308A-ms98-a-0021 221.952625 226.253375 especially down the southern part of the st[ate]- the country which is
sw2308A-ms98-a-0022 226.253375 240.986125 [silence]
sw2308A-ms98-a-0023 240.986125 244.068375 oh that's terrible
sw2308A-ms98-a-0024 244.068375 280.356000 [silence]
sw2308A-ms98-a-0025 280.356000 286.940250 well that's good so is your grandmother um impaired is she of Alzheimer's or something like that
sw2308A-ms98-a-0026 286.940250 303.493500 [silence]
sw2308A-ms98-a-0027 303.493500 305.715500 [laughter-oh]
sw2308A-ms98-a-0028 305.715500 313.482250 [silence]
sw2308A-ms98-a-0029 313.482250 317.271125 oh that does happen yeah
sw2308A-ms98-a-0030 317.271125 318.314250 [silence]
sw2308A-ms98-a-0031 318.314250 319.467375 yep
sw2308A-ms98-a-0032 319.467375 324.680000 [silence]
sw2308A-ms98-a-0033 324.680000 329.997125 you know my neighbors across the street their uh mother was sick at times and
sw2308A-ms98-a-0034 329.997125 344.744125 they they couldn't handle her so they put her in a home and then uh the old Frenchman he'd get a little drunk look round at his kids oh you still need your mother i guess i'll look after her an[d]- and that what happens a lot when when people are sick 
sw2308A-ms98-a-0035 344.744125 358.181625 or they just real manic depressants they end up being put in homes and it's like oh well but that's it's it's i'm really glad that i come from an area where um
sw2308A-ms98-a-0036 358.181625 364.969125 that there's good people in the homes but it's just as it doesn't matter if it is like you say the best place
sw2308A-ms98-a-0037 364.969125 375.960750 they still don't want to go to these homes and my grandmother's real there i mean she cries every day this has been over a year and she tries to make me feel really guilty but i have to you know
sw2308A-ms98-a-0038 375.960750 388.627250 i have to put my foot down where where my life begins i mean if that was my mother i would really f[eel]- i feel a lot more responsible i would probably take care of my mother i don't really um
sw2308A-ms98-a-0039 388.627250 392.947875 when my father when something if anything happens to him
sw2308A-ms98-a-0040 392.947875 403.888125 i don't want him put in a nursing home just for the fact i don't really want to go and visit him at a nursing home and hopefully that he he can uh get along with uh
sw2308A-ms98-a-0041 403.888125 416.200875 in-house help so he he's going to probably hopefully set it up so that he will uh be able to pay someone to come in and stay with him probably for sixteen hours a day
sw2308A-ms98-a-0042 416.200875 426.804875 because i think that's the best situation is when you're you get that old and you've been independent your whole life you don't want to go into a home because uh
sw2308A-ms98-a-0043 426.804875 436.456875 like i say my father's eighty and he's really active he still has his driver's license here i mean you wouldn't believe what he does he actually tows cars
sw2308A-ms98-a-0044 436.456875 447.924875 and as the years got on the tow trucks got better there easier and he went out and bought himself a flat bed one so he won't have to do very much work an[d]-
sw2308A-ms98-a-0045 447.924875 460.411875 so someone like that they i really don't want to see them go in a home he's got two li[ttle]- dogs that are his constant companions and he always replaces them you know i've had like
sw2308A-ms98-a-0046 460.411875 467.227125 over the past thirty years i've had you know about seven or eight different dogs all the time and there all
sw2308A-ms98-a-0047 467.227125 480.250625 you know it's like oops dad's got these two and the old one dies and the young one goes for a while and he gets another one so i can't see him with[out]- without his animals even though it's very expensive to stay at home
sw2308A-ms98-a-0048 480.250625 488.491375 mentally it's just the best thing for you i mean when you get on in your years it's the only thing you really have
sw2308A-ms98-a-0049 488.491375 493.172250 and i'm thinking when i get older i i i think
sw2308A-ms98-a-0050 493.172250 506.272375 if i brought all my precious belongings with me i think i could live in a home i- i don't want to be a s[elfish]- selfish you know a burden on anyone that's what i think because i see what my grandmother puts me through 
sw2308A-ms98-a-0051 506.272375 511.973000 and i'm and i'm saying that when i get older i could probably make the best of this place
sw2308A-ms98-a-0052 511.973000 526.688625 i mean and of course it's institutional food and everybody hates it and [vocalized-noise] it's so ironic is that they go in there and they lose weight [laughter] it it's really it's bad thing 
sw2308A-ms98-a-0053 526.688625 536.444250 but [vocalized-noise] when they go into the homes they lose weight and li[ke]- because of the institutional food you know i think it's fine but you know 
sw2308A-ms98-a-0054 536.444250 542.989500 my taste um buds are pretty uh flexible and here they are they're always used to these
sw2308A-ms98-a-0055 542.989500 553.997375 old fashioned foods they're really set in their ways and used to have what they could get at home and now they're feeding them um quiche and all kinds of strange food that we would eat
sw2308A-ms98-a-0056 553.997375 564.998625 just they don't feed them the old people food the chicken and biscuits and things like that that's that's the thing my grandmother really misses i mean really growls about
sw2308A-ms98-a-0057 564.998625 575.174250 [silence]
sw2308A-ms98-a-0058 575.174250 576.656000 [vocalized-noise]
sw2308A-ms98-a-0059 576.656000 580.493375 [silence]
sw2308A-ms98-a-0060 580.493375 587.967500 yeah i know if if if people would think ahead of time and do things like that like build the the in-law apartment
sw2308A-ms98-a-0061 587.967500 600.772000 and have it on you know one floor and really easy access well that's what i'm telling my father now he needs a new floor in his bathroom and i says now is the time redo your whole bathroom so you can get in and out
