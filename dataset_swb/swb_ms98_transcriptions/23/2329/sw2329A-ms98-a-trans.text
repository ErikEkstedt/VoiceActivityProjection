sw2329A-ms98-a-0021 59.827875 65.009750 but the problem with it is up here around there's so much salt on the roads
sw2329A-ms98-a-0022 65.009750 69.926250 that it's hard to keep automobiles for any length of time because they all rust out and

sw2329A-ms98-a-0045 179.974375 180.918125 [silence]
sw2329A-ms98-a-0046 180.918125 187.011375 you know it's not really all that that doesn't it's it isn't as good as some of the smaller ones you know that they get a zillion miles
sw2329A-ms98-a-0047 187.011375 195.352750 [silence]
sw2329A-ms98-a-0048 195.352750 200.270875 you what what do you look for uh ease of handling or roominess
sw2329A-ms98-a-0049 200.270875 205.478125 [silence]
sw2329A-ms98-a-0050 205.478125 206.708000 uh
sw2329A-ms98-a-0051 206.708000 219.293000 [silence]

sw2329A-ms98-a-0054 228.588000 239.163250 because we used to go we we we uh built our home and we built it to we designed it to be heated by uh wood you know uh uh wood stove
sw2329A-ms98-a-0055 239.163250 242.414500 so and i like the i like the warmth and the comfort of it so
sw2329A-ms98-a-0056 242.414500 250.885375 every winter we[ll]- i used to go out and chop wood and get it all ready for the next season so a pickup truck was handy for the work i was doing around
sw2329A-ms98-a-0057 250.885375 253.587500 but now everything's done so
sw2329A-ms98-a-0058 253.587500 257.127625 i figure instead of doing that i'll just i'll just order wood but
sw2329A-ms98-a-0059 257.127625 258.391250 uh
sw2329A-ms98-a-0060 258.391250 258.846625 [noise]
sw2329A-ms98-a-0061 258.846625 262.185750 uh i'm just like you gas mileage wasn't a priority
sw2329A-ms98-a-0062 262.185750 266.754625 it was it was comfort and it has to be has to have air
sw2329A-ms98-a-0063 266.754625 270.434500 so down down where you guys are
sw2329A-ms98-a-0064 270.434500 271.481125 [silence]
sw2329A-ms98-a-0065 271.481125 273.933125 it's a necessity yeah
sw2329A-ms98-a-0066 273.933125 277.762625 [silence]
sw2329A-ms98-a-0067 277.762625 281.798250 yeah that's i had i had gone down to Dallas couple weeks ago
sw2329A-ms98-a-0068 281.798250 284.455875 uh on a seminar for a week
sw2329A-ms98-a-0069 284.455875 289.293625 and that's when you broke all the records was up to like ninety six
sw2329A-ms98-a-0070 289.293625 293.971500 eighties and you know when i left here and we're down to the thirties and twenties and
sw2329A-ms98-a-0071 293.971500 295.071250 [vocalized-noise]
sw2329A-ms98-a-0072 295.071250 298.895375 so i can see you yeah and you need air you actually need air now
sw2329A-ms98-a-0073 298.895375 300.879750 it gets warm enough down there for it
sw2329A-ms98-a-0074 300.879750 302.172500 [silence]
sw2329A-ms98-a-0075 302.172500 303.637500 so
sw2329A-ms98-a-0076 303.637500 315.629875 [silence]
sw2329A-ms98-a-0077 315.629875 316.920125 yeah
sw2329A-ms98-a-0078 316.920125 318.487000 [silence]
sw2329A-ms98-a-0079 318.487000 320.002500 oh are you
sw2329A-ms98-a-0080 320.002500 330.747875 [silence]
sw2329A-ms98-a-0081 330.747875 336.415500 so that's that's one of your priorities there's got to be air has to be an automatic
sw2329A-ms98-a-0082 336.415500 340.448875 uh how about uh accessories power windows and all that
sw2329A-ms98-a-0083 340.448875 358.069250 [silence]
sw2329A-ms98-a-0084 358.069250 359.808875 uh
sw2329A-ms98-a-0085 359.808875 362.539125 so you got a yeah
sw2329A-ms98-a-0086 362.539125 368.522625 [silence]
sw2329A-ms98-a-0087 368.522625 369.791125 yeah
sw2329A-ms98-a-0088 369.791125 374.756125 [silence]
sw2329A-ms98-a-0089 374.756125 380.221125 so if you know if you know where where you're get getting your your automobile from
sw2329A-ms98-a-0090 380.221125 384.648875 it's best to buy it that way because like our sales tax up here is seven percent
sw2329A-ms98-a-0091 384.648875 385.895750 [silence]
sw2329A-ms98-a-0092 385.895750 387.815375 it's eight percent down there
sw2329A-ms98-a-0093 387.815375 389.248625 s[o]- who
sw2329A-ms98-a-0094 389.248625 397.672500 so if you go out and you're talking like a ten or fifteen thousand dollar vehicle and you add that sales tax on that's a that's a big chunk of change you have to come up with
sw2329A-ms98-a-0095 397.672500 402.800375 and then we have an excise tax up here too i don't know if you have one every year down there
sw2329A-ms98-a-0096 402.800375 404.002875 [silence]
sw2329A-ms98-a-0097 404.002875 410.186000 so they take the they take the uh whatever the book value of the vehicle is
sw2329A-ms98-a-0098 410.186000 416.226250 and then whatever your tax rate is and they just tax you every year on the vehicle or two vehicles yes it's terrible
sw2329A-ms98-a-0099 416.226250 417.236125 [silence]
sw2329A-ms98-a-0100 417.236125 420.607750 and in our town we live in a like a rural area
sw2329A-ms98-a-0101 420.607750 424.294125 and they have a fire tax that they add on too
sw2329A-ms98-a-0102 424.294125 430.832375 so so we've got to pay a fire tax and we got to pay you know two taxes
sw2329A-ms98-a-0103 430.832375 431.907375 [silence]
sw2329A-ms98-a-0104 431.907375 434.979500 sounds like you got a a little one there
sw2329A-ms98-a-0105 434.979500 436.534250 oh
sw2329A-ms98-a-0106 436.534250 438.752500 [silence]
sw2329A-ms98-a-0107 438.752500 443.901750 so once you buy a vehicle and you pay you pay the sales tax that's it they don't tax you on it anymore
sw2329A-ms98-a-0108 443.901750 451.934875 [silence]
sw2329A-ms98-a-0109 451.934875 457.943000 so that's what they consider property tax it's like like if you own your own home you have to pay property tax
sw2329A-ms98-a-0110 457.943000 459.572375 [noise]
sw2329A-ms98-a-0111 459.572375 463.311750 [silence]
sw2329A-ms98-a-0112 463.311750 464.342875 yeah
sw2329A-ms98-a-0113 464.342875 470.190750 [silence]
sw2329A-ms98-a-0114 470.190750 473.145875 i still have to pay it yeah that's just like up here too
sw2329A-ms98-a-0115 473.145875 475.236125 it's like that Mustang that we have
sw2329A-ms98-a-0116 475.236125 476.243500 [silence]
sw2329A-ms98-a-0117 476.243500 481.299375 the excise tax on it every year there's a minimum you have to pay and and it's only twelve dollars
sw2329A-ms98-a-0118 481.299375 493.803000 so we've got an automobile that's that's got some class to it but i don't really i can't tell now what kind of a car is coming down or what kind of a car i'm following unless i get up close enough to read the name on it
sw2329A-ms98-a-0119 493.803000 495.362000 because they all look the same
sw2329A-ms98-a-0120 495.362000 506.812750 [silence]
sw2329A-ms98-a-0121 506.812750 509.902000 yeah and if you take care of it i mean you can get
sw2329A-ms98-a-0122 509.902000 512.641875 uh some good mileage out of it
sw2329A-ms98-a-0123 512.641875 517.070000 because of the the i'm driving a Pontiac now
sw2329A-ms98-a-0124 517.070000 523.188000 and it's uh it's a sixty seven Pontiac it's got a hundred fifty eight thousand miles on it
sw2329A-ms98-a-0125 523.188000 523.656750 [noise]
sw2329A-ms98-a-0126 523.656750 529.279875 and it's absolutely gorgeous just i mean just glides along and i still get that good mileage and
sw2329A-ms98-a-0127 529.279875 531.334500 i take it back and forth to work
sw2329A-ms98-a-0128 531.334500 535.950875 and then my wife's got a a an eighty four Parisian Pontiac
sw2329A-ms98-a-0129 535.950875 539.059000 and that's a big car it's a V8 four door
sw2329A-ms98-a-0130 539.059000 541.296625 and that's got uh
sw2329A-ms98-a-0131 541.296625 547.068000 a hundred and sixteen thousand miles on it and that runs perfectly well too
sw2329A-ms98-a-0132 547.068000 550.465125 [silence]
sw2329A-ms98-a-0133 550.465125 562.686625 so when we get like i said you know the next one when she decides to to sell the car she has now i'll end up with the Parisian and my wife will have the newer one of course and
sw2329A-ms98-a-0134 562.686625 566.422875 so we we just been doing it for years and years and years
sw2329A-ms98-a-0135 566.422875 575.026250 [silence]
sw2329A-ms98-a-0136 575.026250 576.752500 that's incredible
sw2329A-ms98-a-0137 576.752500 579.634250 [silence]
sw2329A-ms98-a-0138 579.634250 584.721875 yeah if you're going to pay the same amount of money and and you don't really know where it came from
sw2329A-ms98-a-0139 584.721875 585.724000 [silence]
sw2329A-ms98-a-0140 585.724000 587.664000 then you're buying somebody's headaches probably
sw2329A-ms98-a-0141 587.664000 589.366375 [silence]
sw2329A-ms98-a-0142 589.366375 592.128500 it's yeah and there's no warranty
sw2329A-ms98-a-0143 592.128500 593.565000 [silence]
sw2329A-ms98-a-0144 593.565000 595.825875 so whatever happens to it you're stuck with it
sw2329A-ms98-a-0145 595.825875 600.031125 unless you buy it from i say somebody you know you know like from a family member or a like that one
