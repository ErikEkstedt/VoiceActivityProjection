sw2359A-ms98-a-0046 261.316000 272.312625 that the reason why she didn't like it was that she felt that the place wasn't cleaned well um they had um younger kids you know wiping the tables down and they weren't very
sw2359A-ms98-a-0047 272.312625 284.168000 well trained i guess and they didn't do a very neat job in cleaning the tables off and when the waitresses came they she just put all of the clean utensils and everything right on top of these dirty tables [laughter]

sw2359A-ms98-a-0053 318.004000 332.154125 but [vocalized-noise] they don't look you know like uh [vocalized-noise] she had complained about it one time and the girl said she was sorry she picked up these utensils and and when back and grabbed some new ones and then put the new ones back down and the new ones looked worse than the ones that she took away so she is not even looking you know and
