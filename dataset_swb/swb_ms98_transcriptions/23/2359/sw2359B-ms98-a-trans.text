sw2359B-ms98-a-0016 70.504000 77.207750 oh that sounds uh very much like one of our very very best places to get steaks
sw2359B-ms98-a-0017 77.207750 86.000500 uh and they open at five and if your not there at five thirty you'll probably have about an hour wait
sw2359B-ms98-a-0018 86.000500 97.708000 and they have a bar also which is always crowded as can [laughter-be] but it's it's an specially fine restaurant and when you consider they take no plastic or checks
sw2359B-ms98-a-0019 97.708000 104.194875 strictly cash and they've been in business oh for at least forty years uh that's they

sw2359B-ms98-a-0032 159.053375 171.580000 yes right well one of the nicer restaurants supposedly that opened up here not uh too very long ago uh called Harbor Lights specializes in fish 
sw2359B-ms98-a-0033 171.580000 177.423375 and uh the atmosphere is fantastic and i was there with it's a group um
sw2359B-ms98-a-0034 177.423375 191.253250 that uh we were having a going away dinner for a friend and there were twelve of us and i the the food that uh we ordered uh each of us was quite good but the service was horrendous
sw2359B-ms98-a-0035 191.253250 205.681000 and the the waitress never once came behind me um um on our side of the table she reached across the table she never once asked if we wanted coffee we had to grab onto someone else they didn't
sw2359B-ms98-a-0036 205.681000 217.887375 refill our water glasses um someone had only eaten a portion of their food and wanted to take it home and asked to have it boxed and she just pitched it out
sw2359B-ms98-a-0037 217.887375 224.859000 and then when she finally did bring something um to replace that she practically threw it at the person
sw2359B-ms98-a-0038 224.859000 226.466125 yes and
sw2359B-ms98-a-0039 226.466125 230.001375 [silence]
sw2359B-ms98-a-0040 230.001375 240.959000 oh absolutely [vocalized-noise] what made me angry was that when there are groups such as ours there were twelve of us they automatically put the tip on the bill
sw2359B-ms98-a-0041 240.959000 251.461875 and i'll tell you we had some very unhappy people who were so unhappy with the service and resented paying fifteen percent tip when they had such poor service
sw2359B-ms98-a-0042 251.461875 252.668375 but
sw2359B-ms98-a-0043 252.668375 254.422375 [silence]

sw2359B-ms98-a-0049 271.217125 281.120000 [silence]
sw2359B-ms98-a-0050 281.120000 294.830375 oh well it [vocalized-noise] one thing that gets me is when you see them do uh putting out the um the um knives forks and what have you and when they put them down they hold them by the edge that you are going to put in your mouth
sw2359B-ms98-a-0051 294.830375 300.338250 and that really up sets me when i see that [laughter]
sw2359B-ms98-a-0052 300.338250 302.390750 oh

sw2359B-ms98-a-0062 330.320125 336.319375 no no and actually you know those are the kind of things that should get taken back to the management
sw2359B-ms98-a-0063 336.319375 351.122500 um because the the the waitresses have no control over the the way the dishes are and uh cleaned in the kitchen and if they're not cleaned off well when they go through the dishwasher food just doesn't always get washed off and it sticks on there and then when they dry them
sw2359B-ms98-a-0064 351.122500 357.192875 um if they air dry them or heat dry them it dries it right on and that's terrible
sw2359B-ms98-a-0065 357.192875 361.340000 [silence]
sw2359B-ms98-a-0066 361.340000 362.533875 yes

sw2359B-ms98-a-0069 377.852250 386.386250 one time enough for me to be aware of the situation and i look at every glass that i [laughter-get]
sw2359B-ms98-a-0070 386.386250 397.353125 yeah i don't mind that um my husband never cared for fast food so we didn't go that often but you know i have no problem with uh going to a McDonald's or a Wendy's or uh
sw2359B-ms98-a-0071 397.353125 404.136375 or a a Long John Silver's or any of those once in a while not often but once in a while

sw2359B-ms98-a-0087 471.749750 473.245625 and the
sw2359B-ms98-a-0088 473.245625 474.745500 [silence]
sw2359B-ms98-a-0089 474.745500 476.198875 no

sw2359B-ms98-a-0095 501.000500 511.613875 but many of the smaller stores grocery stores card shops uh rest[aurants]- smaller restaurants i can't compete with some of the larger ones and they are all going under
sw2359B-ms98-a-0096 511.613875 523.077500 [silence]
sw2359B-ms98-a-0097 523.077500 526.358500 yes yes absolutely
sw2359B-ms98-a-0098 526.358500 529.435500 [silence]
sw2359B-ms98-a-0099 529.435500 544.307625 well i um uh i've been retired from education uh for oh what eight years and i do i have a bunch of had i should say a bunch of little jobs such as a a sales associate um [vocalized-noise] of women's
sw2359B-ms98-a-0100 544.307625 555.100875 specialty dress shop and um i was a a manager part-time at a card and gift shop as well as teaching in a modeling agency and modeling so

sw2359B-ms98-a-0102 569.713125 580.933125 and it was in a uh shopping strip that had a grocery store on one end that took them almost four years to really get that going and that strip filled up
sw2359B-ms98-a-0103 580.933125 585.278625 but Kathy selected the middle store in the middle strip
