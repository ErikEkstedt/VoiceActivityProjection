sw2371A-ms98-a-0017 67.074750 73.856375 i'm not uh fan of cold weather i've lived up in in the northern part of the country and i never did like the cold weather that much

sw2371A-ms98-a-0024 93.220375 96.928250 yeah so i like Texas it's a nice place to be
sw2371A-ms98-a-0025 96.928250 102.088750 and so i guess it's probably the same over where you're at in Garland as opposed to Lewisville
sw2371A-ms98-a-0026 102.088750 110.860000 i would think i don't know might be a little bit different because_1 the city interferes with the weather patterns to a certain extent because_1 of the heating of the of the concrete and asphalt
sw2371A-ms98-a-0027 110.860000 112.301750 [silence]
sw2371A-ms98-a-0028 112.301750 117.437250 that's why they say always say it's like five degrees warmer in the city at night time than out in the country

sw2371A-ms98-a-0081 314.569625 316.641625 you just adapt [noise]
sw2371A-ms98-a-0082 316.641625 325.452375 to a certain extent here in the summer time we go back and forth between air-conditioned buildings there you go back and forth between warmed up areas i mean uh
sw2371A-ms98-a-0083 325.452375 337.015875 i remember when i was living in Indiana i was uh uh g[oing]- going to school there and i used to ride my bike across campus and one day it was it must've been close to ten degrees above zero and
sw2371A-ms98-a-0084 337.015875 347.301875 and i thought well if i ride my bike the wind chill will be close to zero it will last seven minutes six minutes if i walk it'll be ten degrees warmer but it will last twenty minutes
sw2371A-ms98-a-0085 347.301875 356.024250 which do i want you know it's colder for a shorter time or a little bit warmer for a for a longer time and so i took the shorter colder option
sw2371A-ms98-a-0086 356.024250 364.362875 and i got down to where i uh to to the building i was going to and my face was about frozen off and i thought was that such a good choice i weren't quite so sure at that point
