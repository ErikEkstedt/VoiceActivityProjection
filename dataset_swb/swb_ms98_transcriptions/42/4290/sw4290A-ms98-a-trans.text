sw4290A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 7.828250 [noise] i generally uh prefer to do repairs that i am capable of doing myself if it results in significant money savings
sw4290A-ms98-a-0002 7.828250 21.198000 [silence]
sw4290A-ms98-a-0003 21.198000 24.922875 yeah yeah i'm finding that too [laughter]
sw4290A-ms98-a-0004 24.922875 32.761125 [silence]
sw4290A-ms98-a-0005 32.761125 37.728375 that's right you better you better enjoy doing it or else it's not really worth it
sw4290A-ms98-a-0006 37.728375 51.114500 the last one i did myself was i was i found that i was backing out of the garage and i got a little too close to the door on the driver's side i was uh watching too closely on the passenger side i guess 
sw4290A-ms98-a-0007 51.114500 54.136625 and i wasn't paying attention closely enough and i ended up
sw4290A-ms98-a-0008 54.136625 61.931250 whacking my uh side view mirror off the side [laughter-of] [laughter-my] car which kind of uh made me kick myself but 
sw4290A-ms98-a-0009 61.931250 62.994125 [silence]
sw4290A-ms98-a-0010 62.994125 64.666375 [noise] yeah
sw4290A-ms98-a-0011 64.666375 70.506625 but i looked into getting that replaced and that was going to cost a fair amount of money because i would have to take it to the uh dealer
sw4290A-ms98-a-0012 70.506625 78.082750 who would put a factory replacement part on and then charge me fifty bucks and hour to do the work
sw4290A-ms98-a-0013 78.082750 90.125125 and so i figured well i can do that myself i i'll pick up the mirror myself which alone was more money than i wanted to spend on a just a stup[id]- little mirror but it was it it's one of those power ones and it's hea[ted]- heated and 
sw4290A-ms98-a-0014 90.125125 91.716750 and all that
sw4290A-ms98-a-0015 91.716750 101.556375 and i was going on a trip the next day so i figured i'd go out that night and put the mirror on but i ended [laughter-up] i had to take the whole door apart uh to 
sw4290A-ms98-a-0016 101.556375 108.971750 yeah to get the cable where the cable plugged in to the uh to the rest of the system was way down in the door
sw4290A-ms98-a-0017 108.971750 119.043000 yeah it was more than i really wanted to do and then i got it i finally got it all apart figured out what i had to do and i put the mirror on and i got it plugged in and i put the door back together
sw4290A-ms98-a-0018 119.043000 124.528875 and everything was fine i also have power windows and i had to have the window down to do what i was doing
sw4290A-ms98-a-0019 124.528875 128.797875 an[d]- oh no i'm sorry i had to have the window up to do what i was doing and i went to uh
sw4290A-ms98-a-0020 128.797875 139.747125 no it was down it was down i had to have the window down i went to uh put the window back up it was the middle of winter and the window wouldn't [laughter-go] [laughter-up] because_1 i had the cable yeah 
sw4290A-ms98-a-0021 139.747125 142.155625 [silence]
sw4290A-ms98-a-0022 142.155625 153.683500 and no i took the door all apart again and i moved the cable over so it wasn't blocking the window but uh i don't know it used to be fun doing those sorts of things and i do[n't]- maybe i'm loosing interest or
sw4290A-ms98-a-0023 153.683500 157.391000 also cars are getting a lot more complex than [laughter-they] [laughter-used] to be
