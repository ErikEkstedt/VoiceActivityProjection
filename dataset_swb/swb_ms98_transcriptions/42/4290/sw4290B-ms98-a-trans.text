sw4290B-ms98-a-0007 23.689000 35.146125 it's also you know it's also getting to the point where i'm sitting there saying well gee unless i am really enjoy doing this th[is]- it's costing me more money to do it myself then it would for uh i mean that's the reason [laughter] i mean it
sw4290B-ms98-a-0008 35.146125 37.091875 [silence]

sw4290B-ms98-a-0013 60.864750 65.395125 yeah the the the other things you always do oh geez shoot [laughter]
sw4290B-ms98-a-0014 65.395125 77.005625 [silence]
sw4290B-ms98-a-0015 77.005625 78.639750 um-hum

sw4290B-ms98-a-0018 92.269375 99.819375 [silence]
sw4290B-ms98-a-0019 99.819375 102.420250 oh because you couldn't acc[ess]- you couldn't access it

sw4290B-ms98-a-0023 108.089250 110.801250 so it ended up being a bitch huh [laughter]
sw4290B-ms98-a-0024 110.801250 118.294750 [silence]
sw4290B-ms98-a-0025 118.294750 119.516875 right
sw4290B-ms98-a-0026 119.516875 136.165000 [silence]
sw4290B-ms98-a-0027 136.165000 144.230750 [laughter] so you had a trip that you had to go to the next day in the middle of winter and your window would not come back up all right
sw4290B-ms98-a-0028 144.230750 156.618500 [silence]
sw4290B-ms98-a-0029 156.618500 166.731000 yeah that that's part of the reason why i have cut down also is that uh same reason uh last thing i did was just replace my uh uh light on uh
sw4290B-ms98-a-0030 166.731000 176.257375 you know headlights in the front now that one i you know it act[ually]- they actually said to go in and get the service person to do that too and i said well forget that
sw4290B-ms98-a-0031 176.257375 180.108000 uh bu[t]- and it was kind of a a pain
sw4290B-ms98-a-0032 180.108000 187.308625 because you uh y[ou]- you couldn't really fix it without leaving the lights on [laughter]
sw4290B-ms98-a-0033 187.308625 191.192500 because it i didn't ha[ve]- it doesn't have a uh off
sw4290B-ms98-a-0034 191.192500 195.076375 yeah it's one of those um uh flipping type headlights
sw4290B-ms98-a-0035 195.076375 196.764750 and you
sw4290B-ms98-a-0036 196.764750 198.453125 [silence]
sw4290B-ms98-a-0037 198.453125 206.919625 right right and some of them you know they have uh uh one click where you where it goes up and it's li[ke]- not on on some of the some but this one did not
sw4290B-ms98-a-0038 206.919625 219.304750 no but i figured a way to get around it but it was kind of a really stupid way to have to do it is y[ou]- is you get it up in the air and then you turn then you take the battery off and then it then it can't bring it back down [laughter] all right
sw4290B-ms98-a-0039 219.304750 225.832750 right and then but then the lights are still out [laughter] so you're not sitting there going i can't see [laughter]
sw4290B-ms98-a-0040 225.832750 232.297000 [silence]
sw4290B-ms98-a-0041 232.297000 233.898500 right

sw4290B-ms98-a-0044 237.503375 239.566375 [silence]
sw4290B-ms98-a-0045 239.566375 245.127000 right i mean there there probably is but they didn't bother to tell me so [laughter] [vocalized-noise]
sw4290B-ms98-a-0046 245.127000 251.501625 -[tha]t's great uh then that's the other thing is that there always seems to be some really weird tool
sw4290B-ms98-a-0047 251.501625 252.633625 [vocalized-noise] 
sw4290B-ms98-a-0048 252.633625 262.009125 and things like you know oil filters e[very]- every car now it's so tight i[n]- i[n]- in the region where where the engines are you can never get to the oil filter
sw4290B-ms98-a-0049 262.009125 268.407250 though though i guess it's getting a little better again because um what they did is first they used to have the big cars and big engines
sw4290B-ms98-a-0050 268.407250 279.684875 then they got the small cars with the not well designed engines now they're redesigning enough that s[ome]- that to some extent it's it's accessible again but i remember a couple of those cars you know you'd sit there and say
sw4290B-ms98-a-0051 279.684875 284.772250 there's no way anyone could get in there unless they could take the car and put it up into the air
sw4290B-ms98-a-0052 284.772250 288.852500 [silence]
sw4290B-ms98-a-0053 288.852500 290.419125 right y[eah]-
sw4290B-ms98-a-0054 290.419125 291.829625 [silence]
sw4290B-ms98-a-0055 291.829625 299.458000 and i uh every year you hear somebody gets themselves killed by climbing under a car or under a jack and the only thing you you know i guess you
