sw4217A-ms98-a-0002 1.009500 29.002375 [silence]
sw4217A-ms98-a-0003 29.002375 31.436375 yeah i- i agree with you there
sw4217A-ms98-a-0004 31.436375 35.728750 the metric system is very good i'm um i'm um
sw4217A-ms98-a-0005 35.728750 46.059750 do drafting i'm i'm a engineer and i've done drawing and and have to do calculation of fluid mechanics and thing
sw4217A-ms98-a-0006 46.059750 57.797000 and if you ever have to try to do four different conversions to to to try and all [noise] four different type of system with gravitational constant
sw4217A-ms98-a-0007 57.797000 61.217500 and it it just goes it just goes on and on
sw4217A-ms98-a-0008 61.217500 70.089875 -[a]nother th[ing]- thing is that when doing your drawing you can scale them_1 so much easier thing because their increment of ten's so much easier
sw4217A-ms98-a-0009 70.089875 73.265250 i mean your your life is just uh so much easier i
sw4217A-ms98-a-0010 73.265250 77.034375 i really think that what can be done differently
sw4217A-ms98-a-0011 77.034375 89.761875 is that it's it's to ingrain in our society to shift it all our prototype all our our mode our template [vocalized-noise] our bolts our threads everything
sw4217A-ms98-a-0012 89.761875 99.678000 the tooling the tooling is is so is so uh in in our system that it just it it just going to take a lot to move it away
sw4217A-ms98-a-0013 99.678000 103.460000 [silence]
sw4217A-ms98-a-0014 103.460000 112.897500 well most of them_1 have the matrix set now but it's it's it's uh i think it's more in the the the the bolts and threads and stuff it self i mean the
sw4217A-ms98-a-0015 112.897500 121.325625 the screw machine and stuff that makes all those thing they're just they cost millions of you know thou[sand]- hundred of thousand's of dollars and thing and that's
sw4217A-ms98-a-0016 121.325625 135.800750 and i guess maybe they could be re[sented]- some of them_1 could be resented but the comp[any]- the business community just doesn't want to do that i think what really needs to be done is that they need to be educated that in the long run their life is going to be so much easier
sw4217A-ms98-a-0017 135.800750 141.540125 [silence]
sw4217A-ms98-a-0018 141.540125 145.998125 oh exactly also the trade you're you're exactly right
sw4217A-ms98-a-0019 145.998125 150.061125 yeah it's uh we need to do that
sw4217A-ms98-a-0020 150.061125 156.967375 and uh as i said the the main thing you know like just in the calculation th[e]- th[e]-
sw4217A-ms98-a-0021 156.967375 169.384625 [silence]
sw4217A-ms98-a-0022 169.384625 170.782250 exactly

sw4217A-ms98-a-0028 178.942375 181.534875 oh okay i know what that is yeah
sw4217A-ms98-a-0029 181.534875 184.267500 [silence]
sw4217A-ms98-a-0030 184.267500 185.795625 yeah it's it's
sw4217A-ms98-a-0031 185.795625 194.855125 you know and then that each individual company has their own set of guidelines they they they use
sw4217A-ms98-a-0032 194.855125 202.365625 but we our [vocalized-noise] our society in the United State in the global in in the world
sw4217A-ms98-a-0033 202.365625 204.005500 [silence]
sw4217A-ms98-a-0034 204.005500 209.631500 and the economic seem that nobody really wants to be
sw4217A-ms98-a-0035 209.631500 211.102500 [silence]
sw4217A-ms98-a-0036 211.102500 215.495875 compatible with everybody else we started out with the computers
sw4217A-ms98-a-0037 215.495875 224.487250 and we've we've had to fight tooth and nail just to get them_1 to be some what compatible and they're all just going off and all dif[ferent]- all these different directions
sw4217A-ms98-a-0038 224.487250 230.296625 and i guess one of the problem is is that the goal isn't to pro[duce]- pro[duce]-
sw4217A-ms98-a-0039 230.296625 241.338750 -[pro]duce the technology the goal is to produce the buck the the all mighty dollar is so powerful that it just it it just control our destiny

sw4217A-ms98-a-0046 282.727875 284.648125 yeah well i guess
sw4217A-ms98-a-0047 284.648125 286.270500 so you just
sw4217A-ms98-a-0048 286.270500 287.416625 [silence]
sw4217A-ms98-a-0049 287.416625 290.184500 [noise] yeah i guess that's that's true
sw4217A-ms98-a-0050 290.184500 297.771250 i really [vocalized-noise] like first thought i can't really think of what the different would be the different has to do with uh
