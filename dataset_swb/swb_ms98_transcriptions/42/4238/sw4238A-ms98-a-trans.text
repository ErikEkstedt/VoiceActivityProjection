sw4238A-ms98-a-0006 35.443625 42.325125 uh in the old days when my wife and i both worked we we probably a little bit more organized with it
sw4238A-ms98-a-0007 42.325125 53.608500 because we would divide up the bills she had her own checking account and she would take responsibility for paying so many bills and i had my own and i would take responsibility for so many and
sw4238A-ms98-a-0008 53.608500 58.779250 and generally entertainment expense so uh everything seemed to work out pretty smoothly
sw4238A-ms98-a-0009 58.779250 63.210125 but uh that was for about the first uh eighteen years of our marriage
sw4238A-ms98-a-0010 63.210125 66.691750 then she dropped out of the work force and uh
sw4238A-ms98-a-0011 66.691750 71.158000 we we have two children both under four so uh
sw4238A-ms98-a-0012 71.158000 76.329250 i i've taken total responsibility but i guess i haven't taken [vocalized-noise]
sw4238A-ms98-a-0013 76.329250 77.800125 yeah yeah
sw4238A-ms98-a-0014 77.800125 83.408000 th[ey'll]- [laughter-be] yeah they'll be uh four and two in April respectively 
sw4238A-ms98-a-0015 83.408000 87.215875 [silence]

sw4238A-ms98-a-0024 122.312875 132.501750 yeah i think wh[en]- uh uh when we were both running separate checking accounts i think there was uh more of a sense of respectful responsibility
sw4238A-ms98-a-0025 132.501750 138.030750 uh [noise] it almost demanded coordination in splitting up bills and stuff
sw4238A-ms98-a-0026 138.030750 147.646875 now it's my paycheck i put it in and i pay the bills and uh uh it doesn't i'm not being critical but my wife kind of has
sw4238A-ms98-a-0027 147.646875 150.761500 the sense that the checkbook is just a blank check
sw4238A-ms98-a-0028 150.761500 157.948000 you know and it's unlimited funds not that she goes out and spends it unlimitedly but it's almost that attitude
sw4238A-ms98-a-0029 157.948000 163.457000 yeah right yeah [laughter-that's] [laughter-yeah] that's kind of how it comes out

sw4238A-ms98-a-0037 209.955000 220.711000 in our in our case it's more of a a philosophy like you know for the next few months we're really going to watch it and we'll t[ry]- try to control the big thing[s]- 
sw4238A-ms98-a-0038 220.711000 228.861625 [silence]

sw4238A-ms98-a-0045 255.077125 260.757250 yeah we went through a period uh well we went through six years of infertility 
sw4238A-ms98-a-0046 260.757250 270.917125 and it uh it was expensive we were writing out checks for you know eight hundred dollar prescriptions and medical procedures and all of that 
sw4238A-ms98-a-0047 270.917125 282.977125 [noise] and my wife was working at the time so i[t]- it and most of it was you know reimbursable on insurance so we had you know big cash flow and it was a little bit of a management problem but it wasn't too difficult with the two incomes 
sw4238A-ms98-a-0048 282.977125 290.831750 and then we got to the point where we really decided we probably couldn't have children so we sort of indulged and we 
sw4238A-ms98-a-0049 290.831750 296.337750 uh leased some expensive cars and took a vacation yeah it 
sw4238A-ms98-a-0050 296.337750 298.850000 well that's what exactly what happened yeah w[e]-
