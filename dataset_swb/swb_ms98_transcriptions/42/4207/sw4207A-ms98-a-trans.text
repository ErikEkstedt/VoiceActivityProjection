sw4207A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 9.181250 [noise] uh actually it took me quite a while to get someone uh about six minutes so i have had some time to think about this and you know what is been done and what's could be done and what should be done
sw4207A-ms98-a-0002 9.181250 10.445750 um
sw4207A-ms98-a-0003 10.445750 17.414250 i think up to this point and time the problem with uh recollection or waste what ever
sw4207A-ms98-a-0004 17.414250 24.348875 is that it is sort of on a voluntary uh bases where you know you have to actually [vocalized-noise] except
sw4207A-ms98-a-0005 24.348875 29.289500 personal effort to make it happen you know like take your papers to the
sw4207A-ms98-a-0006 29.289500 38.385375 uh recycling center you take this uh one place or another and um in Portola Valley where i live
sw4207A-ms98-a-0007 38.385375 44.704625 the i guess [vocalized-noise] i use [vocalized-noise] garbage company i don't know what they do in Mountain View but uh
sw4207A-ms98-a-0008 44.704625 51.275875 uh they have a program that uh they send a truck through
sw4207A-ms98-a-0009 51.275875 55.583250 basically you don't have to do anything all you have to do is to put your papers
sw4207A-ms98-a-0010 55.583250 67.389000 uh out put your bottle out in a bag put your paper out in a bad and they do the recollection for you basically they come by in a cycle quite a bit like garbage pick-up
sw4207A-ms98-a-0011 67.389000 70.537875 um and in fact

sw4207A-ms98-a-0018 98.596375 100.095000 oh okay
sw4207A-ms98-a-0019 100.095000 117.457000 [silence]
sw4207A-ms98-a-0020 117.457000 123.380000 [laughter] the garbage is [vocalized-noise] inspected
sw4207A-ms98-a-0021 123.380000 126.755250 [laughter]

sw4207A-ms98-a-0025 130.798625 139.534875 [silence]
sw4207A-ms98-a-0026 139.534875 153.182250 well i think the only way to make it really successful is to make it as easy as possible for people and and i think that uh practice here uh you know i lived previously in Dallas up to uh a year or so ago practice here of
sw4207A-ms98-a-0027 153.182250 158.307375 sort of making it an automated part of garbage pick-up uh seems to be a step forward
sw4207A-ms98-a-0028 158.307375 177.573625 [silence]
sw4207A-ms98-a-0029 177.573625 192.536375 [noise] well my sister-in-law lives in northern Wisconsin and they have a financial system there actually i can't recall exactly what it is but you have uh sort of a free pick up of sorted garbage if you sort it and and it's actually pretty tedious 
sw4207A-ms98-a-0030 192.536375 204.337375 [laughter] sorted not sorted free pick-up the uh free pick-up of sorted garbage uh but y[ou]- its actually pretty [vocalized-noise] 
sw4207A-ms98-a-0031 204.337375 216.673750 nitpicking how you have to sort it uh and for sorted garbage uh indiscriminate garbage there is a fee oh a rather exorbitant fee
sw4207A-ms98-a-0032 216.673750 217.938125 uh
sw4207A-ms98-a-0033 217.938125 219.212500 [silence]
sw4207A-ms98-a-0034 219.212500 229.135750 well uh uh uh it i guess in it this is also a subject inspection as you well mention but uh i a it's basically on an all name basis if you this the [vocalized-noise]
sw4207A-ms98-a-0035 229.135750 240.118625 uh sorted stuff that you put out is uh quite a healthy fee for for picking that up and i think it's free or something like that for the stuff that is sorted
