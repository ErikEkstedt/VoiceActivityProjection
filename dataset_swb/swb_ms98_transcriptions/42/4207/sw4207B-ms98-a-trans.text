sw4207B-ms98-a-0018 162.930750 168.671750 do you think it would help if there were um financial incentives like
sw4207B-ms98-a-0019 168.671750 178.623375 you know were people bring the um uh there cans and um and you get a penny a can or something do you think those types of uh remediation are to

sw4207B-ms98-a-0032 239.902625 244.935125 yeah around here also i'm in Mountain View and i presume in
sw4207B-ms98-a-0033 244.935125 258.556750 this whole area i expect that the kind of pick-up that that you have in Porta Valley and we have here are now very common uh at least in this area and we also have um uh day when there's um
sw4207B-ms98-a-0034 258.556750 261.331500 uh two days a year when there's hazardous waste
sw4207B-ms98-a-0035 261.331500 268.472000 um drop-offs were we've dropped off things like cans of paint that are in or garage and drop-off um other things
sw4207B-ms98-a-0036 268.472000 277.163250 uh and its a different sort of recycling but it's also uh very helpful to keep that stuff from going down the drain and into the water system and
sw4207B-ms98-a-0037 277.163250 289.064250 wherever else that goes and i don't know what they do with the one that happen seems like it's a uh significant problem for thing that you don't won't people to put down the drain and i don't i don't know if those go into landfills or
sw4207B-ms98-a-0038 289.064250 290.542000 i don't know
sw4207B-ms98-a-0039 290.542000 294.536000 landfills [noise] actually don't seem like a good solution either for them
