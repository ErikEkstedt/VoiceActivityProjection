sw4275B-ms98-a-0006 17.397375 18.794000 [noise]
sw4275B-ms98-a-0007 18.794000 31.355500 uh yes and no uh and my f[our]- uh three almost four year old is been in a preschool half a day uh since September it's a Montessori school
sw4275B-ms98-a-0008 31.355500 38.698000 and in a sense that's a day care although we don't use it for day care we chose it because of the educational features of the school
sw4275B-ms98-a-0009 38.698000 46.294000 uh prior to that we had a woman come over uh one or two afternoons a week
sw4275B-ms98-a-0010 46.294000 56.114625 and uh provide in home day care uh more or less to give my wife you know a break in the afternoons to uh go out and run errands and do things 
sw4275B-ms98-a-0011 56.114625 67.508750 um but care for us the the problematic time is in the evening uh just finding babysitters because of the ages we don't really
sw4275B-ms98-a-0012 67.508750 76.251000 it's not that we don't trust but we just don't feel comfortable with uh [noise] uh younger kids uh early teens
sw4275B-ms98-a-0013 76.251000 84.993125 uh we've been pretty fortunate we've had babysitters that tend to be in their late teens they drive over in their own cars
sw4275B-ms98-a-0014 84.993125 93.422000 uh the older woman who watches the the kids during the day sometimes comes over in the evening [noise] so
sw4275B-ms98-a-0015 93.422000 101.075000 i i've been saved i've only had to take babysitters home twice i guess which isn't bad but we have uh 
sw4275B-ms98-a-0016 101.075000 111.595875 a[ll]- all of our families lives in Saint Louis so the normal family infrastructure that uh a lot of people have just isn't there for us
sw4275B-ms98-a-0017 111.595875 119.825375 we don't have uh i mean [vocalized-noise] my my wife has a younger sister who's ten years younger but has children the same age as
sw4275B-ms98-a-0018 119.825375 126.530750 and we were asking Denise one time well how much do you pay for babysitters she goes i don't know i've only paid one [laughter-once]
sw4275B-ms98-a-0019 126.530750 132.792375 yeah and that was you know after three years but she just has in-laws and siblings and
sw4275B-ms98-a-0020 132.792375 144.924000 uh you know parents that that watch and neighbors she lives in a neighborhood that has a lot of uh young families and our neighbors seem to be mostly retired
sw4275B-ms98-a-0021 144.924000 155.577500 plus it's harder to to impose on uh you know neigh[bors]- uh they're willing to take the kids but it's it feels difficult to impose when they don't have kids themselves
sw4275B-ms98-a-0022 155.577500 157.355875 [silence]
sw4275B-ms98-a-0023 157.355875 159.802875 do you ever do any babysitting yourself
sw4275B-ms98-a-0024 159.802875 175.690250 [silence]
sw4275B-ms98-a-0025 175.690250 178.639375 um-hum it's a it's a great job
sw4275B-ms98-a-0026 178.639375 183.176625 uh you know for the most part uh especially you know in our house it's
sw4275B-ms98-a-0027 183.176625 194.412250 it's clean and neat and the refrigerator's stocked and most the time when they come over in the evening it's you know an hours worth of of real care and then the rest is just taking responsibility for sleeping children
sw4275B-ms98-a-0028 194.412250 195.421750 [silence]
sw4275B-ms98-a-0029 195.421750 200.524750 we did have uh one occurrence that was kind of interesting we had two women that came
sw4275B-ms98-a-0030 200.524750 208.576875 [noise] alternatively uh when our daughter was about one year old and uh
sw4275B-ms98-a-0031 208.576875 218.786000 it wasn't a problem situation but it was one that just made my wife somewhat nervous the woman wasn't quite together she was easily distracted
sw4275B-ms98-a-0032 218.786000 231.218125 she was nice enough the kids uh you know my my daughter liked her but we ended up uh choosing not to to have her on a regular basis making a conscious decision and
sw4275B-ms98-a-0033 231.218125 248.197625 [noise] it was a tough one because it was convenient for us she was dependable in in that she would show up but we just didn't feel comfortable and we see our friends who have kids the same age making more easy decisions uh
sw4275B-ms98-a-0034 248.197625 255.213000 meaning that uh they're they seem to be pretty lax in in who comes in and who watches them
sw4275B-ms98-a-0035 255.213000 264.954625 we have a friend who has a large house and they have uh three kids under four years old they have twins and they're in
sw4275B-ms98-a-0036 264.954625 274.139250 they have a live-in housekeeper and it just isn't a person that we would have even to our home on a a regular basis much less on a
sw4275B-ms98-a-0037 274.139250 279.977375 uh live-in basis just different value systems and uh different
