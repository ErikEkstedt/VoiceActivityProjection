sw4228B-ms98-a-0004 12.411500 14.708375 uh i bought a Taurus um
sw4228B-ms98-a-0005 14.708375 20.969250 the thing i want always wanted a car with a big trunk so i can carry a lot of stuff that's one of the prime considerations
sw4228B-ms98-a-0006 20.969250 33.506625 i want something that's reasonably reliable and something that's not likely to get expensively damaged in a small crash and you can't get all three today you [laughter-got] got to give up one or the other
sw4228B-ms98-a-0007 33.506625 41.665750 [silence]
sw4228B-ms98-a-0008 41.665750 54.390250 um-hum yeah the the fuel economy is not a big factor uh especially with the way that gasoline prices now are below what they were in nineteen eighty of course they were pretty outrageous then but but
sw4228B-ms98-a-0009 54.390250 60.260625 yeah in in real dollars it's just not not much of a factor um you know the uh
sw4228B-ms98-a-0010 60.260625 66.478250 what your ma call its it does it's it's less than insurance i think [laughter] for example
sw4228B-ms98-a-0011 66.478250 74.093375 [silence]
sw4228B-ms98-a-0012 74.093375 86.599250 well i d[on't]- that's that would be that would be reasonable i think i'm i'm wondering about the economic justification for taxing gasoline some more you say well it's a a nonrenewable resource uh
sw4228B-ms98-a-0013 86.599250 95.175750 but i don't know there's lots of nonren[ewable]- -[non]renewable resources that one could tax just because they're nonrenewable including everything you mine out of the ground um
sw4228B-ms98-a-0014 95.175750 104.866625 i don't know if if there really is that justification but uh it certainly is is more more palatable to have them tax gasoline and use it to
sw4228B-ms98-a-0015 104.866625 112.013375 build roads than it is to have them_1 t[ake]- take tolls which means you got to stop and means that
sw4228B-ms98-a-0016 112.013375 113.416500 [silence]

sw4228B-ms98-a-0041 215.518250 223.074250 um so many times you get behind somebody and you wonder what's up ahead and if that person stops then you might have a hard time stopping
sw4228B-ms98-a-0042 223.074250 232.408375 so y[ou]- or you or you just can't see around it like somebody could come in from an intersection you couldn't see it because the van blocks your field of view but uh
