sw4241A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 2.351375 [noise] okay um 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0002 2.351375 8.845750 i guess i'm not real familiar with recycling because i've been in the army for twenty years so uh 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0003 8.845750 10.250250 uh 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0004 10.250250 20.111125 [laughter-right] so uh actually the f[irst]- my first encounter with it was at the the place we were originally renting uh which was a small community near here and they 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0005 20.111125 23.114250 they gave each household one of these plastic 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0006 23.114250 26.829625 uh bins or whatever to put our our stuff in 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0007 26.829625 31.278500 and uh then when we moved into the townhouse where we are now 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0008 31.278500 35.532750 th[ere]- there again there was no recycling program and now there is 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0009 35.532750 37.472250 and uh so we 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0010 37.472250 44.431625 we're recycling uh all the cans the glass bottles all the plastic and the newspapers which 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0011 44.431625 45.385750 [noise] 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0012 45.385750 48.828375 [silence] 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0013 48.828375 49.971875 um-hum

sw4241A-ms98-a-0017 67.630250 68.958625 um-hum 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0018 68.958625 70.677750 [silence] 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0019 70.677750 71.786750 um-hum 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0020 71.786750 74.633500 [silence] 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0021 74.633500 75.760625 hm 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0022 75.760625 79.573875 [silence] 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0023 79.573875 80.665750 um-hum

sw4241A-ms98-a-0026 84.984625 86.478750 [silence] 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0027 86.478750 87.650250 right 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0028 87.650250 95.544000 ours our regular trash pickups are also twice a week but then the recycling pick up is totally separate and that's on Thursday 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0029 95.544000 97.041750 so uh 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0030 97.041750 100.696500 [silence] 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0031 100.696500 105.055250 um-hum yeah it's just a small town and it's uh it's locally sponsored 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0032 105.055250 107.762250 i don't know what they do with it uh that always 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0033 107.762250 108.705500 uh 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0034 108.705500 113.724750 uh interested me as to where it goes and what they do with it to to process it but uh 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0035 113.724750 118.987125 [silence] 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0036 118.987125 120.010500 um-hum 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0037 120.010500 124.002125 [silence] 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0038 124.002125 125.574750 um-hum 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0039 125.574750 131.728375 hm now i i kind of came up with an idea as well on my own in that 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0040 131.728375 135.070875 i think part of the recycling responsibility falls 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0041 135.070875 140.743375 uh not only with the local or county governments but with the individuals as well 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0042 140.743375 149.751875 becau[se]- uh the individual family is capable of recycling things that never have to be delivered to somebody else to to be recycled 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0043 149.751875 161.169000 and so i've kind of looked for because i'm interested in gardening which is an ideal uh vehicle for recycling i've looked for those things that i can recycle 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0044 161.169000 170.908375 that i can use with my uh organic gardening that uh i like to do yeah and so what for example [noise] what i do is uh 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0045 170.908375 179.854125 recycle the grass clippings and all the leaves that uh not only that i rake but uh that all my neighbors rake up for me [laughter] it's uh 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0046 179.854125 190.048250 it's neat that they uh they will rake it up for me off of their own yards bag it for me and put it on the curb for my easy collection [laughter] and uh 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0047 190.048250 193.278500 so then i just uh get as much as i need 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0048 193.278500 204.924000 which sometimes embarrasses my wife [laughter] she says please don't pickup their grass clippings and i uh take it into the backyard or in this case wherever i can and compost it 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0049 204.924000 210.391500 see and then i can recycle that right into the garden and uh i 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0050 210.391500 213.663000 [silence] 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0051 213.663000 214.871000 um-hum 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0052 214.871000 219.560375 [silence] 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0053 219.560375 220.505625 hm 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0054 220.505625 222.170875 [silence] 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0055 222.170875 223.313750 uh-huh 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0056 223.313750 226.284375 [silence] 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0057 226.284375 228.459375 [laughter-really] 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0058 228.459375 233.401375 so you you have dogs that are vegetarians huh gee that's odd 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0059 233.401375 235.140375 [silence] 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0060 235.140375 236.515625 hm 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0061 236.515625 238.922125 [silence] 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0062 238.922125 240.961750 oh [laughter] 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0063 240.961750 242.378125 [silence] 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0064 242.378125 243.448750 um-hum 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0065 243.448750 246.815500 [silence] 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0066 246.815500 247.944625 um-hum 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0067 247.944625 249.494250 [silence] 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0068 249.494250 251.067750 they they do to huh 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0069 251.067750 253.823625 well that's odd i'd never heard of dogs eating 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0070 253.823625 262.785125 uh vegetable leftovers or anything like that huh because one of the things that they say about compost uh if you make it from grass and leaves and 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0071 262.785125 268.561750 fruits and vegetable leftovers or [scrapses/scraps] that uh it does not attract animals 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0072 268.561750 273.139875 um because there's no meat in it or a[nything]- or fish or anything like that 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0073 273.139875 281.289125 that's interesting that [laughter-you] [laughter-have] dogs that are attracted to compost well they guess they'll be healthy dogs [laughter] 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0074 281.289125 290.297250 [laughter-right] so i uh i do that and then the other thing that i try and do along the same lines is uh because i like to start my own seedlings 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0075 290.297250 292.590625 i look at what 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0076 292.590625 296.729375 i can do with the some of the plastic containers that we have 
sw4241A-ms98-a-0077 296.729375 298.402000 that i can use in the g[ardening]-
