sw4263B-ms98-a-0003 4.155375 10.434375 uh we have two they're going to be two and four years old in April
sw4263B-ms98-a-0004 10.434375 24.417000 and that's after uh twenty one years of marriage [laughter] [laughter-so] so we we've had quite an experience over the last four years of readjusting our time in terms of spending with the kids how about yourself Frank
sw4263B-ms98-a-0005 24.417000 37.141625 [silence]

sw4263B-ms98-a-0012 73.325375 83.417750 two girls yeah yeah and [noise] my wife and i are both from Saint Louis and we've been in New Jersey now for uh eleven years
sw4263B-ms98-a-0013 83.417750 92.076875 so we've been away for a long time and when it was just the two of us we'd go back about every year but now that we have the two girls we try to get back twice a year
sw4263B-ms98-a-0014 92.076875 97.333250 because we both grew up with uh family all around us and weekend with the cousins and
sw4263B-ms98-a-0015 97.333250 103.279500 uh both of our families have uh we have siblings that have lots of children so 
sw4263B-ms98-a-0016 103.279500 110.671625 we miss that environment but and i think partly because of that because our family's a thousand miles away
sw4263B-ms98-a-0017 110.671625 113.354375 we might even overcompensate
sw4263B-ms98-a-0018 113.354375 124.484625 we uh pretty much uh be[tween]- between that thousand mile distance from uh relatives and the fact that we had uh uh eighteen years together 
sw4263B-ms98-a-0019 124.484625 133.947125 married life uh before our daughters were born and uh w[e]- we pretty much i[t]- it seems like our whole life is devoted to the girls
sw4263B-ms98-a-0020 133.947125 136.276375 i mean from [laughter] waking until
sw4263B-ms98-a-0021 136.276375 142.111125 uh till night time w[e]- we literally have an hour and a half to ourselves every night 
sw4263B-ms98-a-0022 142.111125 143.635250 [vocalized-noise]
sw4263B-ms98-a-0023 143.635250 145.456125 [silence]
sw4263B-ms98-a-0024 145.456125 148.825375 no she stays at home uh and
sw4263B-ms98-a-0025 148.825375 162.142750 [silence]
sw4263B-ms98-a-0026 162.142750 164.240375 um-hum
sw4263B-ms98-a-0027 164.240375 166.242875 [silence]
sw4263B-ms98-a-0028 166.242875 168.585750 [laughter]
sw4263B-ms98-a-0029 168.585750 181.649375 it wasn't it wasn't um uh partly because we had all that time together we're ready to focus on a family s[o]- and of uh course the changing economy you know helps focus on the the home life also
sw4263B-ms98-a-0030 181.649375 193.200750 um i mean our lifestyle changed drastically we went from two incomes and no children so we had Caribbean vacations and new cars and expensive cars down to
sw4263B-ms98-a-0031 193.200750 200.884250 one income two children and uh the total uncertainty of the job market now so we we pretty much stay at home
sw4263B-ms98-a-0032 200.884250 207.452625 focus we we do have our older daughter in a preschool a Montessori and that's quite expensive and
sw4263B-ms98-a-0033 207.452625 213.098750 in fact my wife just joined the uh was just elected last night to the board of the school
sw4263B-ms98-a-0034 213.098750 219.244250 so she's spending quite a bit of time in fact she's on the other line right now doing school board talk [laughter]
sw4263B-ms98-a-0035 219.244250 226.145000 so it it seems like even our leisure time it's been focused more centered around the kids
sw4263B-ms98-a-0036 226.145000 227.390125 uh
sw4263B-ms98-a-0037 227.390125 237.452500 [silence]
sw4263B-ms98-a-0038 237.452500 244.442500 it seems to me uh that families are spending more fractional time together
sw4263B-ms98-a-0039 244.442500 250.994625 that maybe one parent will go off with one child and another parent will go off with the other children
sw4263B-ms98-a-0040 250.994625 258.828875 um rather than and focusing more on the children's activities rather than family activities and
sw4263B-ms98-a-0041 258.828875 264.451625 [silence]
sw4263B-ms98-a-0042 264.451625 271.300500 yes and partly because of that working phenomena then the kids end up getting their lives scheduled with
sw4263B-ms98-a-0043 271.300500 279.909375 ballet and football and soccer i mean w[e]- we live in an area that uh soccer and football is just taking off phenomenally
sw4263B-ms98-a-0044 279.909375 288.247375 uh we we have terrible problems with scheduling soccer fields and finding enough land to even to build new football fields that they need
sw4263B-ms98-a-0045 288.247375 294.751000 and part of that phenomena is the dual working household and i think 
sw4263B-ms98-a-0046 294.751000 299.298000 rather than spending the time in the evening with family activities
