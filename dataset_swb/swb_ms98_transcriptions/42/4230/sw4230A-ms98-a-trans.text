sw4230A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 8.817375 well Lynn what do you think should elderly be cared for in the home or do you think they're always better off in a nursing home or are there any answers to something [laughter-like] [laughter-that] 
sw4230A-ms98-a-0002 8.817375 37.876875 [silence]
sw4230A-ms98-a-0003 37.876875 38.916500 yeah
sw4230A-ms98-a-0004 38.916500 40.025250 [silence]
sw4230A-ms98-a-0005 40.025250 47.340250 well m[y]- my mother who's seventy is has living with her my eighty nine year old grandmother
sw4230A-ms98-a-0006 47.340250 51.147750 and oh they're doing fine so far [laughter]
sw4230A-ms98-a-0007 51.147750 52.341125 [silence]
sw4230A-ms98-a-0008 52.341125 53.663250 but uh

sw4230A-ms98-a-0010 54.272000 55.273250 [silence]
sw4230A-ms98-a-0011 55.273250 56.309125 no
sw4230A-ms98-a-0012 56.309125 62.560625 no and and my grandmother's pretty self-sufficient uh she did have a mini stroke recently
sw4230A-ms98-a-0013 62.560625 65.402250 which is left her just a tiny bit addled
sw4230A-ms98-a-0014 65.402250 69.063500 but i don't think she's any place close to needing a nursing home
sw4230A-ms98-a-0015 69.063500 81.095875 [silence]
sw4230A-ms98-a-0016 81.095875 82.821000 oh how sad
sw4230A-ms98-a-0017 82.821000 90.265250 [silence]
sw4230A-ms98-a-0018 90.265250 91.380000 yeah

sw4230A-ms98-a-0023 106.357125 113.086000 [silence]
sw4230A-ms98-a-0024 113.086000 116.542250 that must have been very difficult for her to make that decision
sw4230A-ms98-a-0025 116.542250 137.188375 [silence]
sw4230A-ms98-a-0026 137.188375 142.750500 i think one of the the toughest parts about the decision would be finding the home
sw4230A-ms98-a-0027 142.750500 147.931875 uh i know in Texas we hear so many of so many abuses in nursing homes
sw4230A-ms98-a-0028 147.931875 150.188250 that it's just [noise]
sw4230A-ms98-a-0029 150.188250 152.144625 i don't know where you'd start
sw4230A-ms98-a-0030 152.144625 174.655250 [silence]

sw4230A-ms98-a-0033 187.711875 194.947250 oh yes and probably underpaid in a lot of cases i mean i think that's treated as pretty much unskilled labor
sw4230A-ms98-a-0034 194.947250 211.417625 [silence]
sw4230A-ms98-a-0035 211.417625 212.437250 yeah

sw4230A-ms98-a-0037 215.189875 221.037625 i wonder if the church run nursing homes in general are better than the others
sw4230A-ms98-a-0038 221.037625 238.767125 [silence]
sw4230A-ms98-a-0039 238.767125 239.986250 yeah

sw4230A-ms98-a-0041 242.034750 245.702000 my late in-laws lived at Leisure World
sw4230A-ms98-a-0042 245.702000 260.043625 uh for a number of years but i actually they moved away from there with a daughter before they needed the final care i guess it had graduated levels of care or something in that facility i don't know if you're familiar with that or not it's in Southern California
sw4230A-ms98-a-0043 260.043625 292.626500 [silence]
