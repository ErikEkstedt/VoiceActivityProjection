sw4230B-ms98-a-0002 0.612875 9.899750 [silence]
sw4230B-ms98-a-0003 9.899750 17.844375 well there certainly are times when uh it's necessary i believe to place someone in a nursing home
sw4230B-ms98-a-0004 17.844375 27.271750 um that uh person just becomes too expensive and too um hard on the family
sw4230B-ms98-a-0005 27.271750 30.130000 to care for somebody within their home
sw4230B-ms98-a-0006 30.130000 34.766125 but uh i think everything possible should be done to
sw4230B-ms98-a-0007 34.766125 38.156000 uh keep someone at home before that happens
sw4230B-ms98-a-0008 38.156000 46.828250 [silence]
sw4230B-ms98-a-0009 46.828250 48.118250 oh my
sw4230B-ms98-a-0010 48.118250 50.823875 [silence]
sw4230B-ms98-a-0011 50.823875 52.913000 oh thank goodness
sw4230B-ms98-a-0012 52.913000 55.344625 does your mother have any help
sw4230B-ms98-a-0013 55.344625 68.940625 [silence]
sw4230B-ms98-a-0014 68.940625 73.367500 no i i think it's only when a person becomes
sw4230B-ms98-a-0015 73.367500 81.610000 uh my father had to be placed eventually in a nursing home he had uh Alzheimer's disease
sw4230B-ms98-a-0016 81.610000 82.802250 [silence]
sw4230B-ms98-a-0017 82.802250 84.822375 yeah it's um 
sw4230B-ms98-a-0018 84.822375 91.592625 and it was just impossible to care for him uh twenty four hours a day um
sw4230B-ms98-a-0019 91.592625 93.355375 but uh
sw4230B-ms98-a-0020 93.355375 94.497125 [silence]
sw4230B-ms98-a-0021 94.497125 96.685000 and there weren't enough um
sw4230B-ms98-a-0022 96.685000 102.032000 resources i think in the community to help uh my mother care for him
sw4230B-ms98-a-0023 102.032000 105.722750 which was really [laughter-unfortunate]
sw4230B-ms98-a-0024 105.722750 110.292750 i think i[t]- i[t]- it the placement could have been delayed had there been
sw4230B-ms98-a-0025 110.292750 113.320250 um more resources in their community
sw4230B-ms98-a-0026 113.320250 116.037125 [silence]
sw4230B-ms98-a-0027 116.037125 118.797625 oh it it was
sw4230B-ms98-a-0028 118.797625 119.902125 and uh
sw4230B-ms98-a-0029 119.902125 125.076250 i think she she was there every every day uh
sw4230B-ms98-a-0030 125.076250 129.158375 at noon and at night to make sure that he was
sw4230B-ms98-a-0031 129.158375 131.783500 fed and cared for in
sw4230B-ms98-a-0032 131.783500 133.628750 a proper way and
sw4230B-ms98-a-0033 133.628750 135.064875 [silence]
sw4230B-ms98-a-0034 135.064875 136.501000 it was exhausting
sw4230B-ms98-a-0035 136.501000 150.429750 [silence]
sw4230B-ms98-a-0036 150.429750 151.157125 he
sw4230B-ms98-a-0037 151.157125 152.670375 [silence]
sw4230B-ms98-a-0038 152.670375 159.132000 well i think you know the first thing is just to look at [laughter] lots of them and then
sw4230B-ms98-a-0039 159.132000 165.433125 it it does make a difference if there are regular visits by family um
sw4230B-ms98-a-0040 165.433125 166.631750 [silence]
sw4230B-ms98-a-0041 166.631750 168.905500 that uh the staff
sw4230B-ms98-a-0042 168.905500 175.330875 you know is aware that they can't be neglecting somebody if the family's there everyday
sw4230B-ms98-a-0043 175.330875 176.981375 um
sw4230B-ms98-a-0044 176.981375 180.810625 and i i must say i have some sympathy for the
sw4230B-ms98-a-0045 180.810625 183.997750 nursing home [laughter-staff] itself they
sw4230B-ms98-a-0046 183.997750 185.384375 [silence]
sw4230B-ms98-a-0047 185.384375 187.917875 y[ou]- they are overworked
sw4230B-ms98-a-0048 187.917875 188.723125 uh
sw4230B-ms98-a-0049 188.723125 191.114375 [silence]
sw4230B-ms98-a-0050 191.114375 192.437000 certainly
sw4230B-ms98-a-0051 192.437000 195.517125 [silence]
sw4230B-ms98-a-0052 195.517125 198.469625 yes it's doesn't have um
sw4230B-ms98-a-0053 198.469625 204.633625 uh it's not compensated adequately and the um
sw4230B-ms98-a-0054 204.633625 207.805875 and there's certainly no prestige
sw4230B-ms98-a-0055 207.805875 209.685375 attached to
sw4230B-ms98-a-0056 209.685375 215.623625 uh um you know it's sort of a yeah it's it's it's a sad situation
sw4230B-ms98-a-0057 215.623625 222.423000 [silence]
sw4230B-ms98-a-0058 222.423000 229.902250 i think any uh nonprofit facility is probably better run than
sw4230B-ms98-a-0059 229.902250 236.534875 uh those institutions that are strictly for profit uh so that means
sw4230B-ms98-a-0060 236.534875 239.441250 often that they are church run
sw4230B-ms98-a-0061 239.441250 241.141000 but um
sw4230B-ms98-a-0062 241.141000 246.288250 [silence]
sw4230B-ms98-a-0063 246.288250 247.118000 oh
sw4230B-ms98-a-0064 247.118000 259.609375 [silence]
sw4230B-ms98-a-0065 259.609375 260.818875 yeah 
sw4230B-ms98-a-0066 260.818875 263.374250 actually i um
sw4230B-ms98-a-0067 263.374250 270.535875 m[y]- my work is to advise families in finding care for their elders
sw4230B-ms98-a-0068 270.535875 282.510500 and sometimes that means getting in all kinds of community resources to the home whether it's Meals-on-Wheels or uh home help aids or whatever 
sw4230B-ms98-a-0069 282.510500 290.749250 but when somebody is looking for care i recommend that [laughter-they] [laughter-look] for something that's uh
sw4230B-ms98-a-0070 290.749250 293.316375 has more than one level
sw4230B-ms98-a-0071 293.316375 296.994000 that it's not just an independent living facilit[y]-
