sw4291B-ms98-a-0003 1.854875 4.162125 okay well
sw4291B-ms98-a-0004 4.162125 7.634375 i guess if i was going to advise a parent on um
sw4291B-ms98-a-0005 7.634375 21.799125 well you know maybe how to help their their child choose a college the first thing i'd be interested in is what's the child interested in doing i mean do they have a a a major that they'd want to be interested in you know courses that they'd want to be taking um
sw4291B-ms98-a-0006 21.799125 27.003500 and then the second thing i'd probably look at is uh what they can afford
sw4291B-ms98-a-0007 27.003500 34.796375 you know in terms of you know how much money do they have or does the child have to pay are there any scholarships or anything that they could uh
sw4291B-ms98-a-0008 34.796375 39.471375 manage either you know through maybe an open system or maybe from a school itself
sw4291B-ms98-a-0009 39.471375 43.452750 and then kind of go from there you know that's kind of where i'd start
sw4291B-ms98-a-0010 43.452750 53.622250 [silence]
sw4291B-ms98-a-0011 53.622250 54.854500 um-hum

sw4291B-ms98-a-0025 109.437500 121.631125 um-hum i think those are good points i think one thing i might i might differ with or or maybe we would agree on this is that uh i think there's some i think there some kids who who probably don't really know what they want to take
sw4291B-ms98-a-0026 121.631125 135.364250 you they don't have any work experience or whatever maybe they've taken some classes in high school or something like that i think the advice you give i[s]- is excellent for that i think on the other hand there are there are st[udent]- there are students out there who know what they want to take
sw4291B-ms98-a-0027 135.364250 139.028500 and uh i might advise them to jump right in and
sw4291B-ms98-a-0028 139.028500 146.927875 and find you know a good school that th[ey]- you know that has good standing uh in that area you know has a good faculty has a good reputation
sw4291B-ms98-a-0029 146.927875 149.183500 uh that's what i did

sw4291B-ms98-a-0067 278.002000 281.934000 yeah i mean and that's the thing you have to sit down and look at the uh
sw4291B-ms98-a-0068 281.934000 292.015750 at the individual needs you know i've you know there there some there some students who even as freshmen would be ready to go live in an apartment and and start cooking there own meals and everything but there some who wouldn't be
sw4291B-ms98-a-0069 292.015750 296.108750 i had a very good ex[perience]- i was in the dorms for three or fou[r]- out of my four years
