sw4291A-ms98-a-0011 43.606625 47.155375 yeah that's that's uh those are some good thoughts i
sw4291A-ms98-a-0012 47.155375 55.232250 i found for myself that to start off at a junior college in your local community and find
sw4291A-ms98-a-0013 55.232250 65.273500 that way what you do is that you find what topics you're interested in because you really you can project say a you know uh a s[ay]-
sw4291A-ms98-a-0014 65.273500 72.304500 a student out of high school they might think that they have some interests but they haven't explored everything so they don't really know
sw4291A-ms98-a-0015 72.304500 81.386125 [noise] so if they go to a junior college and and start taking some general ed[ucation]- classes and things if they look through the catalog and think they find things that they're interested in
sw4291A-ms98-a-0016 81.386125 92.093375 well then they c[an]- they rea[lly]- they can really find what they're interests are and then it plus it's also a lot m[ore]- more inexpensive to do it that way
sw4291A-ms98-a-0017 92.093375 94.090375 a[nd]- be and then
sw4291A-ms98-a-0018 94.090375 98.372625 then then they can choose a college and then they can they can transfer
sw4291A-ms98-a-0019 98.372625 109.708375 yeah i guess uh the location is um is something you know it's uh whether they want to be close to their family or whether you know uh farther away or something
sw4291A-ms98-a-0020 109.708375 120.803500 [silence]
sw4291A-ms98-a-0021 120.803500 124.377125 right right

sw4291A-ms98-a-0027 146.371250 147.600000 oh sure
sw4291A-ms98-a-0028 147.600000 148.643000 [silence]
sw4291A-ms98-a-0029 148.643000 150.041250 sure
sw4291A-ms98-a-0030 150.041250 152.337000 yeah yeah
sw4291A-ms98-a-0031 152.337000 161.861625 it just that just helps the decision process when you know what's available because when you're when you're a a kid in sch[ool]- high school and stuff like this is it you're only
sw4291A-ms98-a-0032 161.861625 169.849000 cognizant of sort of your immediate area environment and surroundings so you just don't know what's there you might just you know like go oh wow that's neat you know
sw4291A-ms98-a-0033 169.849000 178.343500 but a[nother]- another thing and this is i think is really important is that the college hype okay 
sw4291A-ms98-a-0034 178.343500 190.184750 and they send this they send these brochures and uh pamphlets and stuff to the the students and you know send us this money and we're going to give you these services and things like that
sw4291A-ms98-a-0035 190.184750 201.552500 that isn't so they they're they're they're two horses of of three different colors and i had an experience uh i had to i stayed in the dormitory
sw4291A-ms98-a-0036 201.552500 209.832000 and i they forced you to have a mean plan okay and so you were forced to go to the dining room and
sw4291A-ms98-a-0037 209.832000 222.325875 the food was terrible you were you were treated like a second rate human being and the dormitory was hinged on a Nazi concentration camp
sw4291A-ms98-a-0038 222.325875 232.854250 and you just you just really didn't have any you know any rights and you just just it's just really structure like that and so one of my main suggestions would be to
sw4291A-ms98-a-0039 232.854250 236.516625 for the parents to go to the college and just
sw4291A-ms98-a-0040 236.516625 249.533250 spend some time and talk to people if they want to send their student to the dorm well go to the talk to some people in there you know talk to the people and get the true information because as i said it's it they're just that's just two different things

sw4291A-ms98-a-0044 259.921250 263.182000 right
sw4291A-ms98-a-0045 263.182000 278.725250 alright but don't fall for the you know the the stu[dent]- the school tour and and all the hype don't fall for it because that's that's not because once you get in there sometimes y[ou]- you make these commitments and you're not able to change them you know c[ommitments]- so
