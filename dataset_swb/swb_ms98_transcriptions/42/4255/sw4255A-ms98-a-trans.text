sw4255A-ms98-a-0023 80.276625 87.497500 [laughter] yeah it reached eighty degrees two days ago and i was in shorts and a T-shirt and i went running
sw4255A-ms98-a-0024 87.497500 96.495125 uh yeah [laughter] and i had the wrong shoes i've just started running i i been into weigh lifting and all and i just started running and i had the wrong tennis shoes
sw4255A-ms98-a-0025 96.495125 99.466750 [silence]
sw4255A-ms98-a-0026 99.466750 106.879000 well um i found out what a difference it [laughter-makes] i just had regular walking shoes that i was running in
sw4255A-ms98-a-0027 106.879000 116.995500 and it didn't give me the support i needed i had too much shock and too much jolting on my knees and my ankles and my joints and my lower back
sw4255A-ms98-a-0028 116.995500 118.458750 [silence]
sw4255A-ms98-a-0029 118.458750 124.998375 oh well um down the sidewalks and uh on the side on the grass the side roads
sw4255A-ms98-a-0030 124.998375 135.819625 but um i was running on the track and it's just carpet with uh a little thin thing of padding and then concrete and in those tennis shoes i had Reebok's on an[d]-
sw4255A-ms98-a-0031 135.819625 140.273750 yeah Reebok walking shoes and they just did [laughter-not] do the job at all
sw4255A-ms98-a-0032 140.273750 145.390125 so about a week after i started running my shin started hurting i got shin splints
sw4255A-ms98-a-0033 145.390125 148.995750 so i went to The Athlete a shoe store here in Tyler
sw4255A-ms98-a-0034 148.995750 161.499750 and tried on several different pairs of shoes i tried Asics and uh Nike Air and uh New Balance and some different type of tennis shoes that are running
sw4255A-ms98-a-0035 161.499750 167.496375 and uh finally got some Nike Air because_1 they have the the air pockets in the front and the back
sw4255A-ms98-a-0036 167.496375 177.498125 and i didn't think that it would make any difference you know i thought well that's just a sales pitch you know and Nike's real expensive because_1 they're always putting out new things and you just pay for the brand
sw4255A-ms98-a-0037 177.498125 188.445500 but i tried on i compared the way that felt to all the other brands and the prices d[ifference]- difference wasn't that much you know maybe ten dollars difference
sw4255A-ms98-a-0038 188.445500 200.499750 and so i finally bought some Nike Air Skylon 2 and so it it they just are wonderful i[t]- it i can run further now because i'm not in pain [laughter]
