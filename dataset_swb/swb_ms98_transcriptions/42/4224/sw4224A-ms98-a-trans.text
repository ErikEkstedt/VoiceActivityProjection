sw4224A-ms98-a-0016 68.128625 80.244875 Headline News was always good because i could get a quick roundup of whatever the top topics were in in like a half hour span and in Around the World in Thirty Minutes i think was their big thing
sw4224A-ms98-a-0017 80.244875 93.939625 and the other thing i used to i uh i miss is CNN um CNN used to go a little bit more in depth um you would get uh like Crossfire you would get you know different different perspectives from usually from like the left and the right liberal and conservative
sw4224A-ms98-a-0018 93.939625 96.831500 arguing the various uh
sw4224A-ms98-a-0019 96.831500 98.699000 [vocalized-noise]
sw4224A-ms98-a-0020 98.699000 104.197375 i think Patrick Buchanan who's now running for president used to be the uh conservative side for that
sw4224A-ms98-a-0021 104.197375 109.695625 [silence]

sw4224A-ms98-a-0031 133.572125 143.487000 and and uh see because_1 i've run into that a couple of times on accident and uh ended up watching it for like extended periods of time but that's how i get most of my news is is
sw4224A-ms98-a-0032 143.487000 149.585000 [silence]
sw4224A-ms98-a-0033 149.585000 163.090875 i tried listening to NPR but uh uh i mean in the mornings i don't in the mornings i want i want a l[ittle]- i want you know the the yeah the USA Today feed you know [laughter] give me a couple of color graphs and uh and i'll be happy

sw4224A-ms98-a-0041 181.446750 186.797875 the only thing that scares me about um the way i do news is
sw4224A-ms98-a-0042 186.797875 192.373375 getting it from like these pre digested sources you know like the like the
sw4224A-ms98-a-0043 192.373375 197.941500 typically what i've heard maybe it's just the people i hang around with but typically i hear people saying that like uh
sw4224A-ms98-a-0044 197.941500 208.873375 the news on TV and what not tends to be um more on the left hand side it tends to be a little bit more liberal and if nothing else it does tend to be more editorialized than these are the facts
sw4224A-ms98-a-0045 208.873375 214.132375 [silence]
sw4224A-ms98-a-0046 214.132375 215.677875 true too
sw4224A-ms98-a-0047 215.677875 233.425250 [silence]
sw4224A-ms98-a-0048 233.425250 234.972375 um-hum

sw4224A-ms98-a-0058 268.129250 279.055125 but see i think you and i perhaps i i think uh well i get the feeling that that you and i perhaps might might take the time to try and figure out exactly what really happened as opposed to what they're telling us even though they maybe close
sw4224A-ms98-a-0059 279.055125 287.212250 but i wonder how much of the rest of America takes the time to to stop with just the the straight spoon fed you know
sw4224A-ms98-a-0060 287.212250 288.512500 [silence]
