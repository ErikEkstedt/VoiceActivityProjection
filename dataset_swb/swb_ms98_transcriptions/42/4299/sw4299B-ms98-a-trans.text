sw4299B-ms98-a-0004 3.552625 11.387750 oh yeah i uh i have a little bit of an interesting experience with music i've been a part-time disc jockey uh
sw4299B-ms98-a-0005 11.387750 19.938250 work for a a company a little company in Virginia that does uh DJ stuff for weddings and uh birthdays and things like that
sw4299B-ms98-a-0006 19.938250 29.907375 so we've uh [noise] we've had to play quite a bit of of music uh over the past several months so it's interesting to see what people like and that sort of thing
sw4299B-ms98-a-0007 29.907375 32.567125 are you involved at all in music or uh
sw4299B-ms98-a-0008 32.567125 35.255750 [silence]

sw4299B-ms98-a-0011 39.243625 40.508125 ah
sw4299B-ms98-a-0012 40.508125 43.493250 [silence]
sw4299B-ms98-a-0013 43.493250 44.873250 hum
sw4299B-ms98-a-0014 44.873250 48.010375 [silence]
sw4299B-ms98-a-0015 48.010375 49.461625 yeah
sw4299B-ms98-a-0016 49.461625 50.539375 [silence]
sw4299B-ms98-a-0017 50.539375 52.423125 um-hum [laughter-right]
sw4299B-ms98-a-0018 52.423125 56.119000 yeah it's interesting now there all going to uh CD's now also
sw4299B-ms98-a-0019 56.119000 59.814750 i uh have a little bit of an involvement in uh
sw4299B-ms98-a-0020 59.814750 65.143375 in square dancing and and round dancing and that's all all a[ll]- still on forty fives
sw4299B-ms98-a-0021 65.143375 72.736000 and uh so they're [noise] they're having an interesting problem when it comes to the music for that because the uh
sw4299B-ms98-a-0022 72.736000 81.060875 the forty fives are generally played on a variable speed turntable so you can speed it up or slow it down for the dancers and uh
sw4299B-ms98-a-0023 81.060875 90.905250 so now they're wondering how they're going to do that with CD's [laughter] it's going to be a little tougher i[f]- if it ever goes to CD's it's not it hasn't converted over yet but
sw4299B-ms98-a-0024 90.905250 96.755250 i think the only group of folks that who even use forty fives for music anymore
sw4299B-ms98-a-0025 96.755250 103.924875 yeah i think that even the aerobics people are using uh all their music is on cassettes or CD's
sw4299B-ms98-a-0026 103.924875 106.778000 [silence]
sw4299B-ms98-a-0027 106.778000 108.095500 um-hum
sw4299B-ms98-a-0028 108.095500 109.113375 [silence]
sw4299B-ms98-a-0029 109.113375 110.329750 right
sw4299B-ms98-a-0030 110.329750 115.700625 yeah i should be able to and cassettes i know that they do have some that are variable speed
sw4299B-ms98-a-0031 115.700625 120.931500 uh i think those are machines for for aerobic instructors
sw4299B-ms98-a-0032 120.931500 123.712875 so uh and uh [noise]
sw4299B-ms98-a-0033 123.712875 132.000250 i found that uh at least at the things i've {DJed} people like music they can dance to [laughter] if you can get them to dance
sw4299B-ms98-a-0034 132.000250 141.155000 it's kind of the hard part uh at these parties they tend to want to sit around or stand around and talk or uh drink and talk or whatever and
sw4299B-ms98-a-0035 141.155000 150.341375 and then getting them to dance and then they they have different taste in dance music some of them like the fast stuff and some the slow and the
sw4299B-ms98-a-0036 150.341375 158.465625 we're kind of uh into oldies right now in ou[r]- in our family for some reason we're most of what we listen to is oldies
sw4299B-ms98-a-0037 158.465625 166.012875 so [noise] and yourself you you just uh mostly listen then yeah

sw4299B-ms98-a-0049 185.489500 191.676875 i've got uh some albums i've picked up that i've kind of recently gotten interested in it's uh
sw4299B-ms98-a-0050 191.676875 194.195500 the uh African music
sw4299B-ms98-a-0051 194.195500 201.161000 uh there's a a group that Paul Simon has uh featured uh well on his album Graceland

sw4299B-ms98-a-0055 210.544750 215.707875 um-hum much of their music is sung in Zulu in the Zulu language so that's uh
sw4299B-ms98-a-0056 215.707875 219.573375 it's a an interesting and uh i guess it kind of falls into the
sw4299B-ms98-a-0057 219.573375 226.595000 i guess the reggae category uh whatever that is [laughter] i'm not quite sure what reggae is actually

sw4299B-ms98-a-0080 290.939500 299.074000 tapes from the library of of what it was like and it was definitely different [laughter] Cajun type music i'd never actually even heard it be[fore]-
