sw4201A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 2.274250 [noise] what kind of car are you driving now
sw4201A-ms98-a-0002 2.274250 4.261750 [silence]
sw4201A-ms98-a-0003 4.261750 6.989250 uh-huh do you like that one
sw4201A-ms98-a-0004 6.989250 8.009125 [silence]
sw4201A-ms98-a-0005 8.009125 9.478750 uh-huh
sw4201A-ms98-a-0006 9.478750 15.710000 [silence]
sw4201A-ms98-a-0007 15.710000 17.984750 how long have you had it
sw4201A-ms98-a-0008 17.984750 23.980125 uh-huh my car that was the main problem i've ever had with it is
sw4201A-ms98-a-0009 23.980125 33.701875 i guess twice i've had to get the valve cover gasket replaced and once the gasket around the the um oil pan
sw4201A-ms98-a-0010 33.701875 38.493750 it's uh nineteen [laughter-eighty] [laughter-two] Cutlass Sierra
sw4201A-ms98-a-0011 38.493750 42.995125 and it still drives pretty well though i had kind of low mileage on it
sw4201A-ms98-a-0012 42.995125 48.995625 [silence]
sw4201A-ms98-a-0013 48.995625 52.475125 wow that's a lot of driving
sw4201A-ms98-a-0014 52.475125 60.990375 [silence]
sw4201A-ms98-a-0015 60.990375 69.472625 uh-huh i think that um i might've done better to get a pickup for the use that i've put mine to
sw4201A-ms98-a-0016 69.472625 75.479250 but um i didn't get it i didn't get that i got a car and that's
sw4201A-ms98-a-0017 75.479250 84.463250 there have been times when i was glad to have a car but most of the stuff i've done has been hauling around and i've been better off to have a pickup
sw4201A-ms98-a-0018 84.463250 90.982000 [silence]
sw4201A-ms98-a-0019 90.982000 93.491125 a full size pickup
sw4201A-ms98-a-0020 93.491125 97.476375 [silence]
sw4201A-ms98-a-0021 97.476375 98.986625 um-hum
sw4201A-ms98-a-0022 98.986625 102.244500 [silence]
sw4201A-ms98-a-0023 102.244500 109.470500 right what do you think you'll get a um step side or a a smooth split side
sw4201A-ms98-a-0024 109.470500 110.531500 [silence]
sw4201A-ms98-a-0025 110.531500 120.307875 yeah my daddy use used to always get a step side and because he has cows and the cows he can
sw4201A-ms98-a-0026 120.307875 126.271750 with a step side you can haul cows in the back because_1 there aren't those humps for the tires
sw4201A-ms98-a-0027 126.271750 127.996000 but
sw4201A-ms98-a-0028 127.996000 138.233125 this last time he decided to still get a step side even though he couldn't find a step side in the long full length they only had them_1 in the short length
sw4201A-ms98-a-0029 138.233125 140.996375 [silence]
sw4201A-ms98-a-0030 140.996375 152.790000 so he was disappointed in that but he still went with the step side because he thought it was easier to get in and around it and take things off the truck and so on without always having to come out the back
sw4201A-ms98-a-0031 152.790000 159.473125 but he uses it on the farm and he built himself a cow trailer so it he didn't need the length so much anymore
sw4201A-ms98-a-0032 159.473125 170.977750 [silence]
sw4201A-ms98-a-0033 170.977750 175.974750 do you just use it for your own purposes and hauling your family around
sw4201A-ms98-a-0034 175.974750 193.464125 [silence]
sw4201A-ms98-a-0035 193.464125 201.483125 right do you have if you're going to go camping are you going to have to drive you car to take your family camping plus drive the truck
sw4201A-ms98-a-0036 201.483125 209.990125 [silence]
sw4201A-ms98-a-0037 209.990125 211.980500 right
sw4201A-ms98-a-0038 211.980500 219.485875 [silence]
sw4201A-ms98-a-0039 219.485875 230.465375 well even though i could've probably used a truck better the last time around i probably will still get a car the next time around figuring that'll be more useful in the future
sw4201A-ms98-a-0040 230.465375 232.483250 so
sw4201A-ms98-a-0041 232.483250 236.993750 i don't know i'll probably look for something that has a
sw4201A-ms98-a-0042 236.993750 240.248250 dealer everywhere i would like to [laughter-drive]
sw4201A-ms98-a-0043 240.248250 241.745250 [silence]
sw4201A-ms98-a-0044 241.745250 244.776250 that'll be the main criterion
sw4201A-ms98-a-0045 244.776250 252.983375 i guess the Japanese makes though do are starting to have dealers all over though i don't know about_1 how the Hyundai dealer network is
sw4201A-ms98-a-0046 252.983375 258.707250 [silence]
sw4201A-ms98-a-0047 258.707250 260.241250 um-hum
sw4201A-ms98-a-0048 260.241250 272.465250 [silence]
sw4201A-ms98-a-0049 272.465250 276.017625 that's true that's a good point i remember
sw4201A-ms98-a-0050 276.017625 276.982250 [silence]
sw4201A-ms98-a-0051 276.982250 285.004625 a long time ago my folks got a Chrysler but the nearest Chry[sler]- Chrysler dealer to them_1 was over fifty miles away
sw4201A-ms98-a-0052 285.004625 290.279875 and it weren't all that good of a car they had pretty many trouble with it
sw4201A-ms98-a-0053 290.279875 295.983875 pretty much trouble so whenever it would break down and take it back to the dealer they'd have to
sw4201A-ms98-a-0054 295.983875 298.082000 to nurse it along
