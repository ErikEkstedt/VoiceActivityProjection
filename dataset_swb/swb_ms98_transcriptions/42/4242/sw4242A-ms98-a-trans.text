sw4242A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 5.741625 [noise] okay Michelle well since i started off i uh since i called in i guess i'll state my opinion first
sw4242A-ms98-a-0002 5.741625 16.285125 and uh i i guess i'd fall in the same category that i don't think there should be any restrictions i think that if unless a weapon is self-propelled or has to be towed Americans should be able to own it
sw4242A-ms98-a-0003 16.285125 17.662000 [noise]
sw4242A-ms98-a-0004 17.662000 38.140625 [silence]
sw4242A-ms98-a-0005 38.140625 39.253625 uh-huh
sw4242A-ms98-a-0006 39.253625 40.322125 [silence]
sw4242A-ms98-a-0007 40.322125 41.390500 um-hum
sw4242A-ms98-a-0008 41.390500 47.357750 [silence]
sw4242A-ms98-a-0009 47.357750 48.674000 absolutely
sw4242A-ms98-a-0010 48.674000 49.680625 [silence]
sw4242A-ms98-a-0011 49.680625 57.761875 i agree i think parents should be held responsible if their child gets a hold of one or either injures injures another person or or themselves
sw4242A-ms98-a-0012 57.761875 59.560625 [silence]
sw4242A-ms98-a-0013 59.560625 74.270875 i also am in favor of a check i- i think the criminal record system in the country should be brought up to snuff so that they can run a computer check as easy as they do when you run a credit card through so they can see if a person insane or is a felon
sw4242A-ms98-a-0014 74.270875 75.450625 i don't [noise]
sw4242A-ms98-a-0015 75.450625 79.075750 [silence]
sw4242A-ms98-a-0016 79.075750 91.016750 it wouldn't do any good right now because the criminal record systems are a mess you know i mean there really isn't any any system as such but if there were and if the government were to invest in that then there wouldn't be any problem they'd
sw4242A-ms98-a-0017 91.016750 94.222750 they'd be able to identify those that shouldn't have
sw4242A-ms98-a-0018 94.222750 99.625125 well there isn't any computerized system that can tell you you know
sw4242A-ms98-a-0019 99.625125 113.414250 yeah i mean in Virginia has done it by the way reason i i'm a life member of the Gun Owners and i am sure no long[er]- member of the NRA so i i'm kind of into this but Virginia Virginia does have an instance check uh system 
sw4242A-ms98-a-0020 113.414250 118.083000 they do have their records within a state computerized and it seems to be working well
sw4242A-ms98-a-0021 118.083000 121.040375 and if it could be done on a federal ba[sis]-
sw4242A-ms98-a-0022 121.040375 123.470000 the only state that i'm aware of
sw4242A-ms98-a-0023 123.470000 124.807250 that's done that
sw4242A-ms98-a-0024 124.807250 129.168875 [silence]
sw4242A-ms98-a-0025 129.168875 131.196250 well uh
sw4242A-ms98-a-0026 131.196250 140.167500 yeah it really you know it's it should be done on a national basis because on the statewide basis you just get those that have violated state laws but
sw4242A-ms98-a-0027 140.167500 144.604250 yeah and some there are federal you know violators too
sw4242A-ms98-a-0028 144.604250 153.013125 so it would require an investment on the part of the government to to bring their records up to shape but i think it's uh probably a good investment anyway uh
sw4242A-ms98-a-0029 153.013125 154.007625 [silence]
sw4242A-ms98-a-0030 154.007625 155.060750 yes um-hum
sw4242A-ms98-a-0031 155.060750 160.355750 [silence]
sw4242A-ms98-a-0032 160.355750 161.506125 uh-huh
sw4242A-ms98-a-0033 161.506125 163.069125 [silence]
sw4242A-ms98-a-0034 163.069125 163.840750 uh-huh
sw4242A-ms98-a-0035 163.840750 168.913125 [silence]
sw4242A-ms98-a-0036 168.913125 170.128875 oh yes
sw4242A-ms98-a-0037 170.128875 174.058250 [silence]
sw4242A-ms98-a-0038 174.058250 175.135375 um-hum
sw4242A-ms98-a-0039 175.135375 177.429125 [silence]
sw4242A-ms98-a-0040 177.429125 183.421375 you know uh in that case uh in particular that fellow that did that had owned those guns a long time
sw4242A-ms98-a-0041 183.421375 189.014000 so i mean it's not like he went in and picked them up and uh then went off on a shooting spree
sw4242A-ms98-a-0042 189.014000 190.454250 and
sw4242A-ms98-a-0043 190.454250 196.827125 [silence]
sw4242A-ms98-a-0044 196.827125 197.933625 that's right
sw4242A-ms98-a-0045 197.933625 206.995625 unfortunately whenever something like ha[ppens]- that happens uh people tend to blame the gun and not the person it is it's it is the person
sw4242A-ms98-a-0046 206.995625 219.183500 [silence]
sw4242A-ms98-a-0047 219.183500 220.180875 um-hum
sw4242A-ms98-a-0048 220.180875 226.463000 [silence]
sw4242A-ms98-a-0049 226.463000 232.797500 yeah i feel that you should be you know you uh if you were single should be allowed to have a weapon to [vocalized-noise] yourself
sw4242A-ms98-a-0050 232.797500 234.142000 but if it
sw4242A-ms98-a-0051 234.142000 238.067125 um-hum but if there were a total ban you know who'd have the guns
sw4242A-ms98-a-0052 238.067125 242.034250 it wouldn't be it wouldn't be the people who'd go to buy them_1 honestly
sw4242A-ms98-a-0053 242.034250 243.399125 [laughter]
sw4242A-ms98-a-0054 243.399125 247.142500 [silence]
sw4242A-ms98-a-0055 247.142500 248.219875 right
sw4242A-ms98-a-0056 248.219875 249.348000 [silence]
sw4242A-ms98-a-0057 249.348000 257.061625 that's right and gun control laws don't stem them because uh they don't they don't most of the criminals don't go buy their guns uh from a gun store anyway
sw4242A-ms98-a-0058 257.061625 259.574250 they get them_1 through the through the black market
sw4242A-ms98-a-0059 259.574250 263.924000 [silence]
sw4242A-ms98-a-0060 263.924000 268.979500 well it's uh it's certainly a a lengthy subject and there's a lot of
sw4242A-ms98-a-0061 268.979500 276.330375 there's a lot of uh discussion about it and what and now and then it becomes a heated argument in both sides but
sw4242A-ms98-a-0062 276.330375 289.509625 but i i've i just feel that the founders of our country the co[nstitution]- people that wrote the constitution didn't intend for us to not have a means to protect ourselves either either from without the country or from within the country
sw4242A-ms98-a-0063 289.509625 291.185125 [silence]
sw4242A-ms98-a-0064 291.185125 298.082000 no i don't i used to i i used to now i'm just a target shooter yeah i used to go uh
