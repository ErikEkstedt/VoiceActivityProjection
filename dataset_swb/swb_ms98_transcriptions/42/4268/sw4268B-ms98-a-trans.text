sw4268B-ms98-a-0002 1.123125 75.513250 [silence]
sw4268B-ms98-a-0003 75.513250 76.452125 [noise]
sw4268B-ms98-a-0004 76.452125 87.968000 [silence]
sw4268B-ms98-a-0005 87.968000 92.383000 my situation is a little bit different but it still covers the same type of problem
sw4268B-ms98-a-0006 92.383000 100.101375 i am a grandmother but i'm also employed but my grandson and his father moved back in and lived with us for about a year
sw4268B-ms98-a-0007 100.101375 102.805250 and so and he was about four
sw4268B-ms98-a-0008 102.805250 108.918375 so it was sort of like another generation raising a a a child and we're all working adults
sw4268B-ms98-a-0009 108.918375 118.646875 so it i have some of the same problems it's no longer a problem now that he is older and in school but this has been a problem no matter what generation you're in
sw4268B-ms98-a-0010 118.646875 128.136500 and one of the things that and then also in the setting where i work i see a lot of uh young people especially uh young women with children
sw4268B-ms98-a-0011 128.136500 134.386375 who have to take time off because of problems with the babysitting or child care services
sw4268B-ms98-a-0012 134.386375 142.776000 and i think uh one of the things that and also when i had the grand[son]- my grandson here that we were keeping care of him
sw4268B-ms98-a-0013 142.776000 150.486500 one of the main problems that affects work and affects the care too is when you're as any when the child is the least bit sick
sw4268B-ms98-a-0014 150.486500 158.680500 uh uh the you have to come get them there's a problem and one of the things i would like to see would be a type of day care service 
sw4268B-ms98-a-0015 158.680500 168.007375 where there is uh at the same place where they're care for as a well child they have facilities for uh sick care
sw4268B-ms98-a-0016 168.007375 178.954750 [silence]
sw4268B-ms98-a-0017 178.954750 180.661250 come get him
sw4268B-ms98-a-0018 180.661250 182.176750 yeah
sw4268B-ms98-a-0019 182.176750 214.095000 [silence]
sw4268B-ms98-a-0020 214.095000 215.693125 no
sw4268B-ms98-a-0021 215.693125 241.926875 [silence]
sw4268B-ms98-a-0022 241.926875 244.227000 well that's an interesting yeah
sw4268B-ms98-a-0023 244.227000 258.059875 [silence]
sw4268B-ms98-a-0024 258.059875 262.541250 oh that's that's another reason why i would preferred it to be with the same services
sw4268B-ms98-a-0025 262.541250 270.239750 the facility that i work with is a large facility and they're looking at day care now and i would love to see day care on site 
sw4268B-ms98-a-0026 270.239750 273.681125 where if you have lunch you can go over and spend it with a child
sw4268B-ms98-a-0027 273.681125 279.062500 uh if you ha[ve]- and i would like a twenty four hour day care and it's big enough where it could do that 
sw4268B-ms98-a-0028 279.062500 283.775375 where if you worked different shifts uh you could uh uh
sw4268B-ms98-a-0029 283.775375 285.702875 bring the child in
sw4268B-ms98-a-0030 285.702875 296.502125 for the night where you know they would be there with you and you can stop in at anytime on your break so that your the check and balances of the type of care is subject to anybody stopping in anytime
