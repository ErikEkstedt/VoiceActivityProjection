sw4268A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 4.141500 [noise] well i have a a couple of of of small children
sw4268A-ms98-a-0002 4.141500 7.411875 one is four uh the other one's an infant
sw4268A-ms98-a-0003 7.411875 14.428875 and when we were looking for care for the older child when he was about nine weeks or so
sw4268A-ms98-a-0004 14.428875 24.761500 i uh i- i had to go back to work i wanted to find someplace with a very uh low ratio of of children to to care giver
sw4268A-ms98-a-0005 24.761500 30.560250 so that the so that my infant could could really receive a lot of attention
sw4268A-ms98-a-0006 30.560250 31.865000 and
sw4268A-ms98-a-0007 31.865000 40.157250 for that first couple of of years i was able to find that in in a family setting
sw4268A-ms98-a-0008 40.157250 45.397375 uh [vocalized-noise] uh a a day care provider offering services out of her own home 
sw4268A-ms98-a-0009 45.397375 56.513375 but her cir[cumstances]- circumstances changed and she lost the the help that she had uh so that they were really now quite a number of of demands on her time
sw4268A-ms98-a-0010 56.513375 62.489375 and we switched over to to a uh a commercial day care service 
sw4268A-ms98-a-0011 62.489375 72.687375 which actually is the best of of both worlds it's it's not a a big chain and they do have separate rooms for the the different developmental ages so i[t]-
sw4268A-ms98-a-0012 72.687375 79.812750 the the youngest one [laughter-now] the the the new infant still receives personalized care
sw4268A-ms98-a-0013 79.812750 86.580750 uh but at the same school his his older brother is receiving uh basically pre kindergarten
sw4268A-ms98-a-0014 86.580750 88.048625 care
sw4268A-ms98-a-0015 88.048625 168.325625 [silence]
sw4268A-ms98-a-0016 168.325625 176.506250 i i i know i i've had the problem myself where the child might might begin to run a a low grade fever
sw4268A-ms98-a-0017 176.506250 187.997875 and the school calls up and says come get your come get your child uh your child looks like maybe he has conjunctivitis come get your child immediately whether or not
sw4268A-ms98-a-0018 187.997875 201.645000 it's really true uh come get your child immediately uh it and that's it's it is a big disruption uh it's particularly bad in the first year if you're back to work and
sw4268A-ms98-a-0019 201.645000 209.087875 you know how frequently that you have to go to the doctor for the little ones just for checkups alone in the first year
sw4268A-ms98-a-0020 209.087875 212.824500 uh sometimes your boss doesn't think that that's
sw4268A-ms98-a-0021 212.824500 214.882000 really terrific [laughter]
sw4268A-ms98-a-0022 214.882000 225.903375 but you have to take time off and and go take your child to to well baby care on top of that now the the general cold and sniffles and and the first year illnesses
sw4268A-ms98-a-0023 225.903375 229.692750 and the school doesn't want to want to keep your child
sw4268A-ms98-a-0024 229.692750 240.019125 we do have up here um and some of the hospitals do this as a way of defraying their costs they run day cares for sick children 
sw4268A-ms98-a-0025 240.019125 243.634125 out of their hospital facilities but
sw4268A-ms98-a-0026 243.634125 248.932250 that i[t]- and it's it's an interesting way to approach it but there's a problem
sw4268A-ms98-a-0027 248.932250 254.714750 i don't know how many parents would be willing to take their children
sw4268A-ms98-a-0028 254.714750 257.973750 to a a a location a child has never seen
sw4268A-ms98-a-0029 257.973750 285.620500 [silence]
sw4268A-ms98-a-0030 285.620500 287.527500 and but yeah
sw4268A-ms98-a-0031 287.527500 296.218625 [silence]
sw4268A-ms98-a-0032 296.218625 299.298000 i i know we we would've liked to
