sw4269B-ms98-a-0021 68.562375 77.737125 yeah it's a sort of thing where with the kind of support you can get from software to for for writing things like that
sw4269B-ms98-a-0022 77.737125 81.061750 uh i wri[ting]- [vocalized-noise] using a u[sing]-
sw4269B-ms98-a-0023 81.061750 90.170375 using a typewriter was sort of like you know uh lighting a fire by like rubbing two sticks together you know instead of using your Bic lighter

sw4269B-ms98-a-0041 178.237375 185.210250 i i[t]- you know it's like wh[en]- when i when i decided to like buy a buy a computer
sw4269B-ms98-a-0042 185.210250 190.253375 i one of the things that like that i i came down to is is that
sw4269B-ms98-a-0043 190.253375 201.172750 i i chose my computer on basis of uh of i- i don't know i guess at work we would call it like you know MIPS per dollar or something like that
sw4269B-ms98-a-0044 201.172750 202.466875 and it turned
sw4269B-ms98-a-0045 202.466875 206.620000 i i did a careful ana[lysis]- i went for my MBA
sw4269B-ms98-a-0046 206.620000 207.270250 [laughter]
sw4269B-ms98-a-0047 207.270250 215.917000 anyway i did a careful analysis of of li[ke]- o[f]- of the of what i could get for how much i was going to spend
sw4269B-ms98-a-0048 215.917000 217.142000 and
sw4269B-ms98-a-0049 217.142000 225.716625 it's like it turned out that that that Macs were almost twice as expensive like per feature than PCs were
sw4269B-ms98-a-0050 225.716625 230.059500 and that was like why that was why i cho[se]- i i ended up cho[se]- ch[ose]-
sw4269B-ms98-a-0051 230.059500 235.138000 even though it's like i evaluated Macs as being the superior
sw4269B-ms98-a-0052 235.138000 239.244000 uh qualitatively better
sw4269B-ms98-a-0053 239.244000 244.439500 in terms of like you know uh what what they could do and like ease of use and things like that
sw4269B-ms98-a-0054 244.439500 256.365250 when i started like uh investigating the cost of software that's when i decided that a PC was like re[ally]- was more cost effective even though it was the inferior product
sw4269B-ms98-a-0055 256.365250 257.739000 uh
sw4269B-ms98-a-0056 257.739000 264.999750 [silence]

sw4269B-ms98-a-0061 278.629625 284.857250 yeah no i i i i agree it it is it i[s]- i[t]- i[s]- is superior in tha[t]- in that case
sw4269B-ms98-a-0062 284.857250 286.122125 but
sw4269B-ms98-a-0063 286.122125 295.330875 i you know one of the things that i- i i think about in terms of o[f]- of like of computers is um
sw4269B-ms98-a-0064 295.330875 298.493250 i[t]- i[t]-
sw4269B-ms98-a-0065 298.493250 300.482000 i think that [noise] i don't know i[t]-
