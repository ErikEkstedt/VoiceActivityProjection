sw4223B-ms98-a-0024 108.846000 114.848375 yeah N[ew]- New Jersey has since New Jersey has had a major waste problem for a couple of years now
sw4223B-ms98-a-0025 114.848375 124.436250 um right now at least in the town i'm in they collect all recyclables paper you know newspaper and junk mail in one bag
sw4223B-ms98-a-0026 124.436250 136.330750 and then mix together cans bottles and that's both aluminum and bimetal cans as well as uh plastics like your soda bottles laundry detergent bottles that type of thing
sw4223B-ms98-a-0027 136.330750 140.765875 and you just put it put it all together into one bin it's nice and convenient
sw4223B-ms98-a-0028 140.765875 157.424125 [silence]
sw4223B-ms98-a-0029 157.424125 158.966250 right
sw4223B-ms98-a-0030 158.966250 162.007375 d[o]- do you have to soak off all the labels too
sw4223B-ms98-a-0031 162.007375 176.966875 [silence]
sw4223B-ms98-a-0032 176.966875 179.079625 [laughter] yeah
sw4223B-ms98-a-0033 179.079625 193.030875 [silence]
sw4223B-ms98-a-0034 193.030875 194.049625 yeah
sw4223B-ms98-a-0035 194.049625 197.176250 [silence]
sw4223B-ms98-a-0036 197.176250 202.255500 well i[t]- it it's that and also in the apartment building you don't have the fear of being caught
sw4223B-ms98-a-0037 202.255500 212.565000 y[eah]- oh in New Jersey they will or they at least they can i i haven't really heard of anyone doing this if you put recyclables in with your regular trash they can refuse to pick up your trash
sw4223B-ms98-a-0038 212.565000 217.957250 but whereas if you're living in an apartment building there's no way of tracing back who put in what
sw4223B-ms98-a-0039 217.957250 236.166750 [silence]
sw4223B-ms98-a-0040 236.166750 237.733375 yeah
sw4223B-ms98-a-0041 237.733375 244.508125 [silence]
sw4223B-ms98-a-0042 244.508125 255.639125 yeah the[y]- they'll do they'll do that here too if uh you put out let's say your glass and cans in a paper bag they'll put a big orange sticker on it saying put it out in a plastic bag or a separate container
sw4223B-ms98-a-0043 255.639125 263.295500 [silence]
sw4223B-ms98-a-0044 263.295500 264.845250 yeah
sw4223B-ms98-a-0045 264.845250 277.018375 [silence]
sw4223B-ms98-a-0046 277.018375 290.265875 yeah the the the problem with that is it's such a long way it doesn't ever get back to the tenants that this is something you really need to do because even if they do a slight rent increase it's so small and over such a long period of time that no one notices
sw4223B-ms98-a-0047 290.265875 295.085875 yeah the the only other way to uh make it a little more um
sw4223B-ms98-a-0048 295.085875 298.466000 useful for people to do is what they had down in Atlanta
