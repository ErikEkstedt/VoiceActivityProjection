sw4223A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 13.588750 uh in Pittsburgh we have just recently in about like last year uh in the fall they started uh a blue bag an[d]- and blue container uh sort of program where you know is that the same for you
sw4223A-ms98-a-0002 13.588750 17.829625 [silence]
sw4223A-ms98-a-0003 17.829625 24.828000 yeah it's curbside and also uh we have a dumpster in the apartment building where i live and there's a blue dumpster too
sw4223A-ms98-a-0004 24.828000 29.846625 when you go to the supermarket they give you uh plastic blue plastic bags
sw4223A-ms98-a-0005 29.846625 40.493250 but i don't think it works out so well where i live uh i'm in in the university area uh w[ell]- because the blue dumpster gets full uh with other things as well so
sw4223A-ms98-a-0006 40.493250 47.849000 i know that the they reject the uh recyclables when they're mixed with other trash so it probably doesn't work out too well
sw4223A-ms98-a-0007 47.849000 54.394750 [silence]
sw4223A-ms98-a-0008 54.394750 65.562625 yeah b[ut]- it but also uh it this seems kind of it's kind of bad but i think it needs to be more convenient to recycle i mean that that almost seems like it's it's as re[cycle]- as convenient as it could be
sw4223A-ms98-a-0009 65.562625 72.783625 but the problem is that you have the garbage dump right there and then you have the recycling d[umpster]- bin right next to it
sw4223A-ms98-a-0010 72.783625 77.393750 [silence]
sw4223A-ms98-a-0011 77.393750 88.508000 yeah but it is pretty nice though that the supermarket i'm not sure whether i mentioned this uh they give you the the the blue plastic bags uh al[ong]- when you when you buy your groceries and you just use those to recycle
sw4223A-ms98-a-0012 88.508000 93.175625 [silence]
sw4223A-ms98-a-0013 93.175625 100.419500 well right now and i was just going to go look for the little pamphlet i have about that uh but it's um
sw4223A-ms98-a-0014 100.419500 109.600375 bottles and cans and they've just added paper to it but what i'm not sure is whether or not you can put them all in the same bag i usually separate them
sw4223A-ms98-a-0015 109.600375 135.766625 [silence]
sw4223A-ms98-a-0016 135.766625 137.718375 right i'm not sure
sw4223A-ms98-a-0017 137.718375 139.938250 [silence]
sw4223A-ms98-a-0018 139.938250 148.048250 yeah i th[ink]- i think uh i think you can put them all in into the same bin i'm li[ke]- i like i said i have been separating them_1 just because i'm not sure 
sw4223A-ms98-a-0019 148.048250 160.038625 uh but i'm i know that the one restriction they have is that uh you're you're not supposed to y[ou]- y[ou]- well obviously you have to clean out anything that had food in it or you know whatever you're not supposed to put things that could have been contaminated
sw4223A-ms98-a-0020 160.038625 161.408125 [silence]
sw4223A-ms98-a-0021 161.408125 171.144375 uh n[o]- i don't soak off the labels [laughter] because that that would be a pretty big pain i- i- i'm like i i'm not quite sure about the exact policy uh
sw4223A-ms98-a-0022 171.144375 177.972000 because i thought i had uh something laying around uh that specified what the policy was but i could never find it
sw4223A-ms98-a-0023 177.972000 185.960000 [laughter] so i i mean i'm s[ure]- i'm sure that it doesn't take that much to to remove the the labels it's a[t]- least doing something um
sw4223A-ms98-a-0024 185.960000 199.498500 but i know i mean i[f]- if i did there all the rest of the people in the apartment building that i that i i live in probably wouldn't because_1 because there's just just a matter of education it's it's just not there
sw4223A-ms98-a-0025 199.498500 201.687375 [silence]
sw4223A-ms98-a-0026 201.687375 203.463125 oh that's true
sw4223A-ms98-a-0027 203.463125 211.713375 [silence]
sw4223A-ms98-a-0028 211.713375 213.808000 right well that's
sw4223A-ms98-a-0029 213.808000 217.111250 [silence]
sw4223A-ms98-a-0030 217.111250 228.706500 right well what they do uh i- i- i don't know anyone that uh has has had had this happen to them because no one that i know has a home in the recycling areas yet
sw4223A-ms98-a-0031 228.706500 236.896250 but uh if you walk along after garbage pickup day uh some people will have their bags still sitting out there with a little note on it
sw4223A-ms98-a-0032 236.896250 246.036625 which i've never read one but i'm assuming is probably telling them_1 telling them why they couldn't pickup that particular uh bag but
sw4223A-ms98-a-0033 246.036625 250.237875 [silence]
sw4223A-ms98-a-0034 250.237875 251.462875 um-hum
sw4223A-ms98-a-0035 251.462875 254.854250 [silence]
sw4223A-ms98-a-0036 254.854250 269.818875 you know what though i bet if they they could certainly just stick the the rental company with with the uh with the bill or or whatever and the[y]- just give the rental have the rental company have more responsibility because they're really
sw4223A-ms98-a-0037 269.818875 278.568250 in that respect they're the only people who could have a[ny]- you know any control over over it o[ver]- over educating their tenants or you know
sw4223A-ms98-a-0038 278.568250 289.436500 [silence]
sw4223A-ms98-a-0039 289.436500 291.130625 yeah [noise]
