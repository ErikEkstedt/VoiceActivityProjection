sw4222B-ms98-a-0003 5.168250 6.807625 hi Ralph
sw4222B-ms98-a-0004 6.807625 13.403500 um uh th[e]- the machine said that the topic was uh taxes
sw4222B-ms98-a-0005 13.403500 21.949750 [silence]
sw4222B-ms98-a-0006 21.949750 26.423375 okay well i'm i'm ready anytime that you want to start
sw4222B-ms98-a-0007 26.423375 37.133375 [silence]
sw4222B-ms98-a-0008 37.133375 39.536000 oh yeah go head
sw4222B-ms98-a-0009 39.536000 52.216000 [silence]
sw4222B-ms98-a-0010 52.216000 55.956750 no i- i know what you mean we're in the process of doing ours and
sw4222B-ms98-a-0011 55.956750 56.969875 [silence]
sw4222B-ms98-a-0012 56.969875 61.091500 it it it does seems [noise] like a lot uh
sw4222B-ms98-a-0013 61.091500 63.971750 i wish i had a better feeling for
sw4222B-ms98-a-0014 63.971750 74.329625 uh a better breakdown rather than oh well you know X X billions of dollars go to defense and X billions of dollars go here
sw4222B-ms98-a-0015 74.329625 83.559375 it it it's hard i i have a hard time conceiving of any larger amount of money then say uh really a couple thousand dollars every thing else is
sw4222B-ms98-a-0016 83.559375 90.072500 is like Monopoly money it it's so larger you don't really have a personal feeling for it if you go to by a new car
sw4222B-ms98-a-0017 90.072500 99.687250 you get a better feeling for for what's going on but even then it usually most of that is is finance through the bank and you not actually holding the money in your hands
sw4222B-ms98-a-0018 99.687250 100.972875 but uh
sw4222B-ms98-a-0019 100.972875 102.624500 i [vocalized-noise]
sw4222B-ms98-a-0020 102.624500 104.492625 Americans in general well
sw4222B-ms98-a-0021 104.492625 105.493625 [silence]
sw4222B-ms98-a-0022 105.493625 118.341250 i i would like to see a little bit better return for the the social program i actually don't mind paying taxes for things like social programs helping people out
sw4222B-ms98-a-0023 118.341250 125.937750 because my basic philosophy is that that most people are out to mess with the system most people actually
sw4222B-ms98-a-0024 125.937750 134.634375 generally want to work or want to to make themselves better and they are not lazy i don't believe that everybody is out there to rip of the system
sw4222B-ms98-a-0025 134.634375 141.143500 but there is a hold lot of bureaucracy and so many places for the money to fall through the cracks that
sw4222B-ms98-a-0026 141.143500 146.034750 after a while it becomes to easy an[d]- an[d]- and people uh
sw4222B-ms98-a-0027 146.034750 155.287500 say well oh sure well we we haven't plan ahead so we could spend twice as much as as what we really need that's okay we will just let it go and
sw4222B-ms98-a-0028 155.287500 161.506375 and then it comes down to the crunch and crisis management and oh well just spend another few thousands dollars an[d]-
sw4222B-ms98-a-0029 161.506375 174.408125 so there there's no good handle on it no one i guess feels really responsible in those situation and all that money adds up and you have enormous cost in the government and people get angry and upset
sw4222B-ms98-a-0030 174.408125 196.091375 [noise]
sw4222B-ms98-a-0031 196.091375 196.957250 huh
sw4222B-ms98-a-0032 196.957250 210.056500 [silence]
sw4222B-ms98-a-0033 210.056500 219.859375 oh sure yeah i know i agree with you on that what sort of a involvement with with something like maybe oh a defenses a little hard but
sw4222B-ms98-a-0034 219.859375 222.820625 but what sort of involvement uh
sw4222B-ms98-a-0035 222.820625 228.084250 would we be able to do what type of oversight would you like to see on that
sw4222B-ms98-a-0036 228.084250 261.877875 [silence]
sw4222B-ms98-a-0037 261.877875 263.537250 huh yeah
sw4222B-ms98-a-0038 263.537250 271.634250 well here it here in Massachusetts i mean we have a just like the rest of the country we have a a server budget problem and
sw4222B-ms98-a-0039 271.634250 275.235875 and often here uh people
sw4222B-ms98-a-0040 275.235875 279.383625 are are angry about their taxes being so high
sw4222B-ms98-a-0041 279.383625 285.402125 and the ideal of the higher taxes is help us to pay off the high deficit in the state
sw4222B-ms98-a-0042 285.402125 295.095375 and many people fall back on well there's money there's a lot of money being misspent its all there we do have to do anything except well it's all out there somewhere
sw4222B-ms98-a-0043 295.095375 298.946000 and the the the next step is to identify where [vocalized-noise]
