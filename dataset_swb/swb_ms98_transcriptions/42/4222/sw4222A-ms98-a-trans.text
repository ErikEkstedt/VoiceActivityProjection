sw4222A-ms98-a-0036 196.870750 200.969125 i guess there [vocalized-noise] seems like their some programs that are more valuable
sw4222A-ms98-a-0037 200.969125 203.627625 and other that be [vocalized-noise]
sw4222A-ms98-a-0038 203.627625 205.901750 that be useful to have more uh
sw4222A-ms98-a-0039 205.901750 209.641125 sort of tax payer involvement in some of that decision making

sw4222A-ms98-a-0045 230.509000 236.755250 i know maybe just in the point of you know having focus group with uh or elected representative will be one
sw4222A-ms98-a-0046 236.755250 238.934500 solutions where they actually
sw4222A-ms98-a-0047 238.934500 244.155125 maybe they do have more in some area of the country then then where i'm from but it's
sw4222A-ms98-a-0048 244.155125 246.615500 i think it's rare to actually no
