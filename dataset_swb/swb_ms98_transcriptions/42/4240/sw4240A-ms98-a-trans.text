sw4240A-ms98-a-0003 3.654250 9.722625 [silence]
sw4240A-ms98-a-0004 9.722625 11.609125 oh that's right yeah
sw4240A-ms98-a-0005 11.609125 28.092000 [silence]
sw4240A-ms98-a-0006 28.092000 32.982750 yeah tha[t's]- that's one problem with uh engineering jobs is
sw4240A-ms98-a-0007 32.982750 40.332250 it's you you really need some sort of more flexible or portable pension you know something more like a
sw4240A-ms98-a-0008 40.332250 45.458750 either 40[1K]- well i guess you get part of into 401K one oh 401K
sw4240A-ms98-a-0009 45.458750 51.077250 but what what is the uh key heal[th]- plan that people who are privately employed use
sw4240A-ms98-a-0010 51.077250 66.528250 [silence]
sw4240A-ms98-a-0011 66.528250 68.048375 right

sw4240A-ms98-a-0013 70.884500 71.982000 um-hum
sw4240A-ms98-a-0014 71.982000 105.587375 [silence]
sw4240A-ms98-a-0015 105.587375 106.568000 yeah
sw4240A-ms98-a-0016 106.568000 111.411500 what also seems like a lot of company set the benefits based on
sw4240A-ms98-a-0017 111.411500 114.527875 your last salary when you left the company
sw4240A-ms98-a-0018 114.527875 117.976500 so you know let's say you've worked there for twenty years
sw4240A-ms98-a-0019 117.976500 124.972375 you stopped working there you go work for somebody else for fifteen years and because of inflation alone
sw4240A-ms98-a-0020 124.972375 134.991375 um you know your twenty years is worthless just because it's it's not an index to fund it's based on the actual dollar amount of when you worked there 
sw4240A-ms98-a-0021 134.991375 139.256375 [silence]
sw4240A-ms98-a-0022 139.256375 140.416000 yeah
sw4240A-ms98-a-0023 140.416000 146.114875 [silence]
sw4240A-ms98-a-0024 146.114875 148.454500 i[t]- be[nefits]- benefits in general
sw4240A-ms98-a-0025 148.454500 165.919000 [silence]
sw4240A-ms98-a-0026 165.919000 167.159000 um-hum
sw4240A-ms98-a-0027 167.159000 170.586125 well that's one thing you do get with a large company they're
sw4240A-ms98-a-0028 170.586125 174.214500 you know it's well it's actually can go both ways someth[ing]- some ways you have
sw4240A-ms98-a-0029 174.214500 178.293375 more opportunities because_1 there're so many things going on within the company
sw4240A-ms98-a-0030 178.293375 186.459000 but you also may get key holed and you are a ex type person therefore you should only work on this type project 
sw4240A-ms98-a-0031 186.459000 195.958750 and that i guess to some extent depends on the philosophy of the company and whether they pigeon hole people or allow people to go in t[o]- to any area they want to
sw4240A-ms98-a-0032 195.958750 202.229750 [silence]
sw4240A-ms98-a-0033 202.229750 205.374625 yeah the[re]- there was some clicking on the line i'm not sure what
sw4240A-ms98-a-0034 205.374625 210.489250 whether that's local or somewhere in the long distance network between
sw4240A-ms98-a-0035 210.489250 212.800125 New Jersey and wherever you are
sw4240A-ms98-a-0036 212.800125 214.483000 California okay

sw4240A-ms98-a-0038 217.721875 220.366125 this is also possible
sw4240A-ms98-a-0039 220.366125 222.683250 somewhere between Texas
sw4240A-ms98-a-0040 222.683250 226.451125 [silence]

sw4240A-ms98-a-0042 227.969125 238.050750 [silence]
sw4240A-ms98-a-0043 238.050750 242.176875 well it depends on where you go if you go up uh far enough north it doesn't
sw4240A-ms98-a-0044 242.176875 245.933375 it gets cheaper again but then again there's y[ou]- y[ou]-
sw4240A-ms98-a-0045 245.933375 249.506375 [silence]
sw4240A-ms98-a-0046 249.506375 250.569500 um-hum

sw4240A-ms98-a-0048 256.673500 259.585750 yeah i know New Jersey is
sw4240A-ms98-a-0049 259.585750 265.984000 just slightly above the national average which was yeah it's about twice the price of Atlanta
sw4240A-ms98-a-0050 265.984000 267.396875 [silence]
sw4240A-ms98-a-0051 267.396875 270.978000 but uh the hou[sing]- the housing prices have definitely dropped
sw4240A-ms98-a-0052 270.978000 277.998250 [silence]
