sw4240B-ms98-a-0002 0.412125 4.345750 [silence]
sw4240B-ms98-a-0003 4.345750 11.456000 um well actually to tell you the truth uh not very well i resigned from Texas Instruments not shortly
sw4240B-ms98-a-0004 11.456000 16.788625 ago and found that my uh after having worked there for
sw4240B-ms98-a-0005 16.788625 18.986375 twenty one years
sw4240B-ms98-a-0006 18.986375 20.517875 [noise]
sw4240B-ms98-a-0007 20.517875 23.718375 my vested interest in my
sw4240B-ms98-a-0008 23.718375 28.788000 pension fund was amounted to less than three quarters of a year of salary
sw4240B-ms98-a-0009 28.788000 48.440375 [silence]
sw4240B-ms98-a-0010 48.440375 52.163500 [noise]
sw4240B-ms98-a-0011 52.163500 66.949875 um i don't know uh th[e]- the uh i g[uess]- i guess the th[at]- that issue was a TI retirement uh benefit is it is what they call a defined a defined benefits program which means if you retire you get benefits
sw4240B-ms98-a-0012 66.949875 68.747250 um
sw4240B-ms98-a-0013 68.747250 71.150125 if you don't retire you get shit
sw4240B-ms98-a-0014 71.150125 80.549500 uh but i think the government sort of passed some kind of legislation some long time ago that said well you can't do that you can't just kiss them_1 off if they don't retire
sw4240B-ms98-a-0015 80.549500 83.504125 and so there's some nominal uh
sw4240B-ms98-a-0016 83.504125 84.775250 [silence]
sw4240B-ms98-a-0017 84.775250 88.990500 a[mount]- amount that has to be vested with the employee
sw4240B-ms98-a-0018 88.990500 95.913625 but uh in this modern day and age where there is job mobility i mean
sw4240B-ms98-a-0019 95.913625 102.046125 uh it's time for employers to stop screwing the employees out of their retirement benefits by
sw4240B-ms98-a-0020 102.046125 105.570500 invoking this uh defined benefits plan
sw4240B-ms98-a-0021 105.570500 114.576625 [silence]
sw4240B-ms98-a-0022 114.576625 115.427750 right
sw4240B-ms98-a-0023 115.427750 127.651750 [silence]
sw4240B-ms98-a-0024 127.651750 128.584500 right
sw4240B-ms98-a-0025 128.584500 134.476375 [silence]
sw4240B-ms98-a-0026 134.476375 140.106375 which is all the more reason i think that the employee should have control over his pension account
sw4240B-ms98-a-0027 140.106375 147.418875 um of course the initial question that was asked related to uh actually i can't remember anymore but to
sw4240B-ms98-a-0028 147.418875 160.901875 [noise] it related to what do you look for in a position other than salary and i guess my mind before it referred to benefits my mind was not thinking a long the with the i[deas]- lines of benefits at all but rather
sw4240B-ms98-a-0029 160.901875 162.111000 um
sw4240B-ms98-a-0030 162.111000 166.584125 career g[ratification]- gratification and you know that kind of thing
sw4240B-ms98-a-0031 166.584125 185.763750 [silence]
sw4240B-ms98-a-0032 185.763750 187.075875 um-hum
sw4240B-ms98-a-0033 187.075875 189.650000 [silence]
sw4240B-ms98-a-0034 189.650000 190.216250 um-hum
sw4240B-ms98-a-0035 190.216250 195.476250 [silence]
sw4240B-ms98-a-0036 195.476250 196.199000 um-hum
sw4240B-ms98-a-0037 196.199000 197.737000 [silence]
sw4240B-ms98-a-0038 197.737000 203.011375 boy i th[ere]- there were some something happened to your s[ignal]- your signal at that point did you notice it
sw4240B-ms98-a-0039 203.011375 204.297125 [silence]
sw4240B-ms98-a-0040 204.297125 204.824125 yeah
sw4240B-ms98-a-0041 204.824125 212.126125 [silence]
sw4240B-ms98-a-0042 212.126125 213.343875 in California
sw4240B-ms98-a-0043 213.343875 214.808000 [silence]
sw4240B-ms98-a-0044 214.808000 217.928250 or whether it's part of the uh switchboard system
sw4240B-ms98-a-0045 217.928250 219.239250 [silence]
sw4240B-ms98-a-0046 219.239250 219.854250 yeah
sw4240B-ms98-a-0047 219.854250 221.261125 [silence]
sw4240B-ms98-a-0048 221.261125 227.042125 well [noise] party of m[y]- part of my reason for coming to California was California
sw4240B-ms98-a-0049 227.042125 234.417250 uh it is it i love it it's a wonderful place but the the price of housing is
sw4240B-ms98-a-0050 234.417250 236.904000 is just totally
sw4240B-ms98-a-0051 236.904000 238.348625 looney
sw4240B-ms98-a-0052 238.348625 243.975125 [silence]
sw4240B-ms98-a-0053 243.975125 252.453625 well that's true up in Redding uh th[e]- housing prices are probably comparable to Dallas where i came from but down here the housing prices are
sw4240B-ms98-a-0054 252.453625 257.132625 about a factor of five higher which is really ridiculous
sw4240B-ms98-a-0055 257.132625 267.065000 [silence]
sw4240B-ms98-a-0056 267.065000 268.995250 at any rate
sw4240B-ms98-a-0057 268.995250 270.486000 [silence]
sw4240B-ms98-a-0058 270.486000 276.027750 [noise] so i guess one of the things you look for in a job uh is um
sw4240B-ms98-a-0059 276.027750 278.492750 affordable cost of living 
sw4240B-ms98-a-0060 278.492750 287.444250 [silence]
sw4240B-ms98-a-0061 287.444250 295.655500 of course the most wonderful thing for the company and the most wonderful thing for the employee too is if what you want to do is to work
sw4240B-ms98-a-0062 295.655500 299.522000 not so great for the family but uh
