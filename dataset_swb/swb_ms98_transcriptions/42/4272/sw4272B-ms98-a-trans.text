sw4272B-ms98-a-0010 12.152625 15.702625 [silence]

sw4272B-ms98-a-0012 17.941000 19.438000 sure
sw4272B-ms98-a-0013 19.438000 24.835125 [silence]
sw4272B-ms98-a-0014 24.835125 26.892875 oh capital punishment definitely
sw4272B-ms98-a-0015 26.892875 29.413375 most people have very strong opinions about it
sw4272B-ms98-a-0016 29.413375 31.329125 usually on both extremes though
sw4272B-ms98-a-0017 31.329125 33.083750 [silence]
sw4272B-ms98-a-0018 33.083750 34.583625 what about yourself
sw4272B-ms98-a-0019 34.583625 60.880250 [silence]
sw4272B-ms98-a-0020 60.880250 63.552250 um-hum we[ll]-
sw4272B-ms98-a-0021 63.552250 68.494500 [silence]
sw4272B-ms98-a-0022 68.494500 73.081000 well i think there's got to be clauses as far as in capital punishment that
sw4272B-ms98-a-0023 73.081000 77.431625 you can not execute anyone that there's not absolute positive identification
sw4272B-ms98-a-0024 77.431625 78.808375 and
sw4272B-ms98-a-0025 78.808375 80.509250 a lot of crimes you
sw4272B-ms98-a-0026 80.509250 86.035000 uh that a a person is convicted they rely on one person's eye witness testimony
sw4272B-ms98-a-0027 86.035000 88.982125 something like that i don't think would be substantial enough
sw4272B-ms98-a-0028 88.982125 96.762375 uh you know somewhere where twenty people s[aw]- watched one person mowed gunned down you know five people
sw4272B-ms98-a-0029 96.762375 100.177875 that's a clear case of a person who should be executed
sw4272B-ms98-a-0030 100.177875 106.812875 and i unfortunately that that is not the situation right now those k[inds]- the punishment is not set up in most states
sw4272B-ms98-a-0031 106.812875 107.872750 [silence]
sw4272B-ms98-a-0032 107.872750 111.578375 you know because_1 as you stated earlier there are some crimes that's so barbaric
sw4272B-ms98-a-0033 111.578375 117.256000 they uh the person that perpetuates the crime deserves to be uh punished
sw4272B-ms98-a-0034 117.256000 128.835500 [silence]
sw4272B-ms98-a-0035 128.835500 131.282250 yeah but unfortunately not in all cases
sw4272B-ms98-a-0036 131.282250 133.702375 that is really the sad part about it
sw4272B-ms98-a-0037 133.702375 134.715250 [silence]
sw4272B-ms98-a-0038 134.715250 139.398625 uh the case in Texas where the person uh shot the restaurant
sw4272B-ms98-a-0039 139.398625 141.906000 i guess it's Ruby's or someplace like that
sw4272B-ms98-a-0040 141.906000 144.935625 he ended up killing himself but if he had survived
sw4272B-ms98-a-0041 144.935625 146.453750 uh
sw4272B-ms98-a-0042 146.453750 152.968500 by some chance i think it would have been criminal if our system had allowed him to live in prison for life
sw4272B-ms98-a-0043 152.968500 172.304750 [silence]
sw4272B-ms98-a-0044 172.304750 173.521500 um-hum
sw4272B-ms98-a-0045 173.521500 175.107625 [silence]
sw4272B-ms98-a-0046 175.107625 177.486625 well i don't think they're necessarily insane
sw4272B-ms98-a-0047 177.486625 179.201500 [silence]
sw4272B-ms98-a-0048 179.201500 180.462000 yeah
sw4272B-ms98-a-0049 180.462000 181.778875 [silence]
sw4272B-ms98-a-0050 181.778875 184.899000 i i think some people can [vocalized-noise]
sw4272B-ms98-a-0051 184.899000 188.766750 fool th[e]- system into believing that they're truly insane
sw4272B-ms98-a-0052 188.766750 196.439125 it and i'm i even if they are insane yeah i'm s[ort]- i'm s[ort]- really sort of a hard core on this w[ell]- uh Dahmer as an example
sw4272B-ms98-a-0053 196.439125 200.104875 yeah there are pr[obably]- seventeen or so victims of his crimes
sw4272B-ms98-a-0054 200.104875 202.567375 we're going to take care of him in prison
sw4272B-ms98-a-0055 202.567375 207.454250 uh for an indefinite period of time you know mental hospitals and so forth rehabilitation
sw4272B-ms98-a-0056 207.454250 210.299500 and that's going to cost us a lot of money
sw4272B-ms98-a-0057 210.299500 213.612125 and i don't really think that we should be doing something like that
sw4272B-ms98-a-0058 213.612125 217.321000 you know whether he w[as]- uh whether he wa[s]- ill or not
sw4272B-ms98-a-0059 217.321000 219.976750 um the crimes were heinous
sw4272B-ms98-a-0060 219.976750 221.348875 uh
sw4272B-ms98-a-0061 221.348875 225.929125 yes it's uh it['s]- a good example of where capital punishment would come in handy 
sw4272B-ms98-a-0062 225.929125 235.273625 [silence]
sw4272B-ms98-a-0063 235.273625 236.623500 um-hum
sw4272B-ms98-a-0064 236.623500 241.625250 [silence]
sw4272B-ms98-a-0065 241.625250 243.093625 well then
sw4272B-ms98-a-0066 243.093625 253.091250 [silence]
sw4272B-ms98-a-0067 253.091250 257.949500 well i[t]- i[t]- i mea[n]- wha[t]- what what would make him rational twenty years of rehabilitation
sw4272B-ms98-a-0068 257.949500 265.995750 is it really worth spending all that time effort to rehabilitate someone who you may never ever be able to rehabilitate
sw4272B-ms98-a-0069 265.995750 270.982250 and who it's questionable whether you should be rehabilitated them_1 in rehabilitating them in the first place
sw4272B-ms98-a-0070 270.982250 280.385125 [silence]
sw4272B-ms98-a-0071 280.385125 281.686125 um-hum
sw4272B-ms98-a-0072 281.686125 285.225250 well i think the state you know it's one thing to torture someone
sw4272B-ms98-a-0073 285.225250 287.082625 when you're ending their life
sw4272B-ms98-a-0074 287.082625 292.592500 which uh was done in the ancient times it's another thing to
sw4272B-ms98-a-0075 292.592500 296.132125 re[latively]- relatively painlessly inject someone with with uh
sw4272B-ms98-a-0076 296.132125 297.954000 uh medication to
