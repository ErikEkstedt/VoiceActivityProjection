sw4272A-ms98-a-0020 40.834375 47.539000 but then occasionally i hear about a heinous crime where i think well if we're going to have public capital punishment then
sw4272A-ms98-a-0021 47.539000 52.313375 you know this guy should definitely get it one thing that bugs me about it is the uh
sw4272A-ms98-a-0022 52.313375 57.961375 finality of it i mean occasionally they make a mistake and send the wrong guy to prison
sw4272A-ms98-a-0023 57.961375 62.126125 sometime later they you know figure it out and they release him
sw4272A-ms98-a-0024 62.126125 68.611875 and uh it bugs me that uh you know this is the one kind of punishment that they definitely can't reverse

sw4272A-ms98-a-0031 120.674375 129.734500 course usually the case where there's a bunch of witnesses and they see one guy uh mow down a bunch of people and those cases the guy usually turns the gun on himself anyway

sw4272A-ms98-a-0045 166.769625 172.997125 uh how by definition can you execute anybody who pulls off a crime like that
sw4272A-ms98-a-0046 172.997125 175.396000 i mean since they're obviously insane
sw4272A-ms98-a-0047 175.396000 177.183875 [silence]
sw4272A-ms98-a-0048 177.183875 183.500000 course i guess there's a definition of insanity of whether the[y]- or not they knew what they were doing that's a little different than what i'm talking about

sw4272A-ms98-a-0054 228.653250 230.929625 there's a case where the guy's obviously ill
sw4272A-ms98-a-0055 230.929625 236.226875 i mean a guy that opens up people's brains and performs lobotomies
sw4272A-ms98-a-0056 236.226875 240.355500 amateur lobotomies i mean is obviously not rational

sw4272A-ms98-a-0058 241.811000 246.122500 i don't know i don't know whether you can you know morally take the power of the state
sw4272A-ms98-a-0059 246.122500 251.190500 to end that guy's life i i don't know i maybe that's a good reason to end his life
sw4272A-ms98-a-0060 251.190500 254.070625 if [laughter] if he's that [laughter-irrational]

sw4272A-ms98-a-0062 271.012125 280.906375 well yeah i don't know that there's any hope of rehabilitating him but the but then the question comes up does the does the state have the right to do you know essentially the same what he did
