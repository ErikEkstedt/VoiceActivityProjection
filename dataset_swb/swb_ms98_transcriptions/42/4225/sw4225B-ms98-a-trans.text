sw4225B-ms98-a-0006 19.315625 28.727250 it's funny that uh that you mention that because health care benefits are really a big issue nowadays because of the skyrocketing costs
sw4225B-ms98-a-0007 28.727250 31.838375 in general yeah our benefits uh
sw4225B-ms98-a-0008 31.838375 38.832125 we we have a choice between an H[MOs]- between various HMOs or just straight uh straight off major medical Blue Cross Blue Shield

sw4225B-ms98-a-0010 40.557000 50.777750 seems like the main idea of insurance companies is to try as hard as possible to deny benefits and collect uh premiums as much as possible
sw4225B-ms98-a-0011 50.777750 52.014875 they're
sw4225B-ms98-a-0012 52.014875 74.214625 [silence]

sw4225B-ms98-a-0017 109.650625 115.909250 yeah it's expensive uh it's very expensive for the company to uh to pay all the benefits out uh
sw4225B-ms98-a-0018 115.909250 122.039375 if you want to talk for a second about non health benefits uh at my office we have free drinks free beverages
sw4225B-ms98-a-0019 122.039375 129.128375 and uh that's really popular that's v[ery]- uh a lot of people like that where we have uh all kinds of uh

sw4225B-ms98-a-0023 146.204250 149.544375 yeah it's very nice uh often if you're
sw4225B-ms98-a-0024 149.544375 159.634875 just having trouble thinking and doing your work you can just get up and walk to the kitchen and uh make yourself a cup of tea a fresh cup of tea herbal tea or whatever and

sw4225B-ms98-a-0035 196.923500 199.326125 yeah that that that is a very nice benefit
sw4225B-ms98-a-0036 199.326125 205.098250 one of the things that we have lacking is the number of vacation days we have uh only two weeks vacation a year
sw4225B-ms98-a-0037 205.098250 206.803375 [silence]

sw4225B-ms98-a-0040 225.084875 235.760875 yeah well in the technology industry it's such a young industry that there aren't very many people that have been in it for a very long time so they don't have the same uh
sw4225B-ms98-a-0041 235.760875 240.577250 scale although at other jobs i've had i['ve]- i've had three weeks vacation
sw4225B-ms98-a-0042 240.577250 243.863125 so uh so stripping down to two was uh
sw4225B-ms98-a-0043 243.863125 250.106000 [silence]
sw4225B-ms98-a-0044 250.106000 252.896000 uh three i've had three

sw4225B-ms98-a-0046 255.464375 257.024625 very short
sw4225B-ms98-a-0047 257.024625 261.046875 the first the first job with the first two were a year and a half each
sw4225B-ms98-a-0048 261.046875 264.134125 and uh and after that i worked for two years
sw4225B-ms98-a-0049 264.134125 267.044000 at the company i'm at where i plan to stay for a while

sw4225B-ms98-a-0053 271.916000 276.846750 that's right but you know in the the c[omputer]- the computer industry is a little bit more liberal with benefits in general
sw4225B-ms98-a-0054 276.846750 279.840875 i think than other industries um
sw4225B-ms98-a-0055 279.840875 286.453125 in terms of uh flex hours and just the you know the whole attitude of the work place
sw4225B-ms98-a-0056 286.453125 287.929375 [silence]
