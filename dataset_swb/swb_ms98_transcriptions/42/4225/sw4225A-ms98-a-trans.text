sw4225A-ms98-a-0003 3.315750 14.744250 yeah uh we got real good benefits where i'm at although they're becoming uh less and less every year so that they're taking a little bit more away uh especially when it comes to health care benefits
sw4225A-ms98-a-0004 14.744250 17.419875 do you guys uh have full coverage where you're at
sw4225A-ms98-a-0005 17.419875 41.458500 [silence]

sw4225A-ms98-a-0008 50.702000 60.667000 yeah yeah i- i i agree uh y[ou]- you pay a lot of money into them_1 and then when you finally do have a claim they uh they really stick it to you they say that it doesn't meet their uh
sw4225A-ms98-a-0009 60.667000 74.485250 you know their their minimum amounts or something like that they've always got these uh these plans set up where they they've got a certain amount benchmarked for like a certain operation or something but when you go to that doctor it's always like ten or fifteen dollars more than what they'll pay for
sw4225A-ms98-a-0010 74.485250 78.623750 and uh that's one thing that really bothers me down here they say that uh
sw4225A-ms98-a-0011 78.623750 86.443625 the the pri[mary]- or the the customary fee should be fifty dollars but then the most of the doctors around here charge seventy five so it doesn't really keep up with what they
sw4225A-ms98-a-0012 86.443625 88.450875 actually have so it's kind of a
sw4225A-ms98-a-0013 88.450875 92.088750 they [vocalized-noise] they kind of take from you a little bit there and uh the uh 
sw4225A-ms98-a-0014 92.088750 99.247625 other thing about Pratt's benefits uh when i first came here five years ago they really had like the best i thought that i'd ever had
sw4225A-ms98-a-0015 99.247625 110.248750 and since then you know they've for the st[aggering]- skyrocketing uh medical costs like you've said uh they've really had to cut back on what they give people because it was just taking too much money out of the company 
sw4225A-ms98-a-0016 110.248750 121.685625 [silence]
