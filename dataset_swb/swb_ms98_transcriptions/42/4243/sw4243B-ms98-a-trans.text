sw4243B-ms98-a-0003 10.554625 12.577250 well um
sw4243B-ms98-a-0004 12.577250 20.242875 i think that uh when you're tried by a jury of your peers they probably uh the collective
sw4243B-ms98-a-0005 20.242875 31.210000 mind of the jury is probably a better vehicle for sentencing than the judge himself uh because_1 then there's the consensus thing rather than a uh a single person

sw4243B-ms98-a-0013 63.284000 67.918250 yeah well i would i c[ould]- i would argue back that uh
sw4243B-ms98-a-0014 67.918250 81.086250 a a single person being able to pass a sentence on someone um leaves it open to his or her own uh biases and they may consider
sw4243B-ms98-a-0015 81.086250 94.255125 arson to be a heinous crime and child molestation to be less severe so the sentence wouldn't be all that uniformed i mean obviously it would be uniform within the parameters of that judge him[self]- him or herself

sw4243B-ms98-a-0021 120.315000 128.086125 yeah that's a that's one of the biggest uh biggest problems i think in our society is that uh the the justice system
sw4243B-ms98-a-0022 128.086125 141.747000 uh basically goes by who's got enough money for the best lawyer and uh the presentation is is everything um so you know you you could have a real dirt ball
sw4243B-ms98-a-0023 141.747000 153.629375 be portrayed by his lawyer as a loving family man and and uh color the color the jury's opinions but um i don't know
sw4243B-ms98-a-0024 153.629375 165.086125 [silence]
sw4243B-ms98-a-0025 165.086125 170.183500 well we could do that or we could explode it to it's logical extreme or it's or
sw4243B-ms98-a-0026 170.183500 172.575250 ridiculous extreme and 
sw4243B-ms98-a-0027 172.575250 176.486125 take uh the new interactive television uh
sw4243B-ms98-a-0028 176.486125 183.010000 technology that's coming forward and uh have everybody in the country or everyone who chose to tune in
sw4243B-ms98-a-0029 183.010000 197.734375 decide guilt or innocence and then uh have a sliding scale of you know the fifty nine percent of the people said you were guilty that means you get the life in prison you know um [laughter]
sw4243B-ms98-a-0030 197.734375 207.761000 [laughter] Wheel of Justice we [laughter-could] have a game show you know we no there there i[t]- it does need reform uh i would worry about a single judge uh
sw4243B-ms98-a-0031 207.761000 213.686875 passing sentence uh especially i[n]- in a more involved trial uh
sw4243B-ms98-a-0032 213.686875 228.476875 i i don't know i think that the founding fathers had a great idea and th[e]- r[eason]- the reason that we went away from the single judge or the the the triad i guess of judges that they have uh in some systems it just um
sw4243B-ms98-a-0033 228.476875 233.140625 you know they become instruments of the government and
