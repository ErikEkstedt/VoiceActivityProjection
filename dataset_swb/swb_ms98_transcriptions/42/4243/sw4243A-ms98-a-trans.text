sw4243A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 11.300500 [noise] okay_1 um we're talking about uh trial by jury and whether or not we thought it was a a fair way to do it do you think that they ought to have the uh the judge do the sentencing to try to make it more uniform or more fair or or what do you think
sw4243A-ms98-a-0002 11.300500 31.071875 [silence]
sw4243A-ms98-a-0003 31.071875 39.757125 well there there is an argument in that uh a judge has seen a lot more cases and you know perhaps he sees one crime
sw4243A-ms98-a-0004 39.757125 47.524125 and and he can compare that crime to you know his long history of of of dealing with with criminals and uh
sw4243A-ms98-a-0005 47.524125 48.558875 [silence]
sw4243A-ms98-a-0006 48.558875 60.624375 the the jury you know this is you kn[ow]- maybe they've sat on sat on a jury once before maybe this is their very first time the only they've really seen is like Gaudy on TV or something like that you know and and they just you know they just kind of
sw4243A-ms98-a-0007 60.624375 63.897000 you know making guesses how bad they think it is
sw4243A-ms98-a-0008 63.897000 93.282750 [silence]
sw4243A-ms98-a-0009 93.282750 96.914125 yeah yeah as as uniformed a[s]- i mean he would he would
sw4243A-ms98-a-0010 96.914125 103.668375 figure out the severity based upon his own personal scale the only thing i worry about is like one
sw4243A-ms98-a-0011 103.668375 108.491125 um one murderer or or let's say one one thief
sw4243A-ms98-a-0012 108.491125 111.103875 um getting like
sw4243A-ms98-a-0013 111.103875 120.891625 a tenth of the penalty of of another thief simply because perhaps he impressed the jury more or or you know just be[cause]- because his presentation was better
sw4243A-ms98-a-0014 120.891625 133.098625 [silence]
sw4243A-ms98-a-0015 133.098625 134.114250 yeah

sw4243A-ms98-a-0019 152.298875 165.415750 see i would almost argue i would consider i i i don't under[stand]- i don't know i haven't thought it out long enough to figure out all the ramifications but getting rid of the entire trial by jury and and having the judge decide guilty or not guilty
sw4243A-ms98-a-0020 165.415750 181.235000 [silence]
sw4243A-ms98-a-0021 181.235000 184.362250 [laughter]

sw4243A-ms98-a-0027 231.607750 239.229875 yeah but i think the the we the people that that our founding fathers were talking about were rich white males
sw4243A-ms98-a-0028 239.229875 241.184500 i mean i don't think
sw4243A-ms98-a-0029 241.184500 252.047875 i- i don't think they had a real high opinion of of the masses i mean Hamilton was was a prime case you know he he didn't i think he referred to them_1 as the mindless masse[s]- he didn't want them_1 to vote he didn't want them_1 to have any say in government
sw4243A-ms98-a-0030 252.047875 255.234375 [silence]

sw4243A-ms98-a-0037 279.279500 292.231500 well i mean only one sen[se]- it seems like a needless step but i think there's only been one person who haven't voted as he was voted into or there's only i think only been one electoral vote that was n[ot]- not voted at in the electoral college
sw4243A-ms98-a-0038 292.231500 295.376875 as the [propular/popular] a[s]- the popular vote was voted
