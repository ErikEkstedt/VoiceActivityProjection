sw4282B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.299375 [noise]
sw4282B-ms98-a-0002 0.299375 1.590125 okay
sw4282B-ms98-a-0003 1.590125 3.003125 [silence]
sw4282B-ms98-a-0004 3.003125 6.999375 well actually interestingly enough a lot of times [laughter]
sw4282B-ms98-a-0005 6.999375 19.791375 well i just retired from the Army after twenty years of uh active uh service uh uh retired out of the Pentagon [noise] and because of the organizations that i was in in the military
sw4282B-ms98-a-0006 19.791375 30.260000 and the jobs that i held and particularly because of the security clearances that i had we had first of all we had regular random testing just because we were in the military
sw4282B-ms98-a-0007 30.260000 43.087500 right and then because of the security clearances that i held i also had uh other regular random uh drug testing for that as well that i actually had to sign an agreement saying that uh
sw4282B-ms98-a-0008 43.087500 45.601375 yeah it was all urine testing
sw4282B-ms98-a-0009 45.601375 50.931875 and it was mainly because of their concern because drug use is illegal
sw4282B-ms98-a-0010 50.931875 64.351000 uh and of course addictive uh it's a perfect thing uh for blackmail for people with high security clearances and so i've kind of over the twenty year period of time i've gotten kind of accustomed [laughter-to] [laughter-it] and
sw4282B-ms98-a-0011 64.351000 70.126250 doesn't bother me uh uh because i've always been in sensitive positions that i understand the
sw4282B-ms98-a-0012 70.126250 79.642375 the problems that can results uh as far as compromise and espionage and uh addiction and blackmail that that has never bothered me
sw4282B-ms98-a-0013 79.642375 81.056250 and uh
sw4282B-ms98-a-0014 81.056250 82.446625 [silence]
sw4282B-ms98-a-0015 82.446625 90.717000 uh-huh and i work for a defense contractor in Virginia called Network Solutions we uh uh we actually operate the NIC for the internet 
sw4282B-ms98-a-0016 90.717000 96.440875 yeah you probably got uh uh information about this program through the internet
sw4282B-ms98-a-0017 96.440875 98.332250 right all of us did
sw4282B-ms98-a-0018 98.332250 102.627625 yep so uh now we don't have any drug testing out there
sw4282B-ms98-a-0019 102.627625 104.003375 [silence]
sw4282B-ms98-a-0020 104.003375 105.341625 uh-huh
sw4282B-ms98-a-0021 105.341625 108.979750 [silence]
sw4282B-ms98-a-0022 108.979750 111.276500 uh-huh huh
sw4282B-ms98-a-0023 111.276500 112.765250 right
sw4282B-ms98-a-0024 112.765250 114.546250 [silence]
sw4282B-ms98-a-0025 114.546250 115.854750 uh-huh
sw4282B-ms98-a-0026 115.854750 120.374625 [silence]
sw4282B-ms98-a-0027 120.374625 121.849250 um-hum
sw4282B-ms98-a-0028 121.849250 123.915625 [silence]
sw4282B-ms98-a-0029 123.915625 134.536250 right exactly i guess so there's uh still a good bit of discussion and controversy about whether it's an invasion of your privacy and uh that sort of thing
sw4282B-ms98-a-0030 134.536250 136.096500 [noise]
sw4282B-ms98-a-0031 136.096500 140.684750 [silence]
sw4282B-ms98-a-0032 140.684750 143.629000 [laughter-right] [laughter-especially] right you don't want to get caught 
sw4282B-ms98-a-0033 143.629000 146.352000 [silence]
sw4282B-ms98-a-0034 146.352000 147.960500 um-hum
sw4282B-ms98-a-0035 147.960500 150.113000 [silence]
sw4282B-ms98-a-0036 150.113000 161.280750 yeah as a matter of fact uh that's such a difficult question to to answer because on the one hand sure uh uh drug testing is an invasion of property or of privacy but yet on the other hand
sw4282B-ms98-a-0037 161.280750 174.082625 for example these uh guys that drive these trains and that sort of thing that uh have been high and uh killed a lot of people yeah it's it's uh right
sw4282B-ms98-a-0038 174.082625 176.081000 [noise] um-hum
sw4282B-ms98-a-0039 176.081000 188.584625 right and i think for the most part the general public tends to support it but uh i'm sure organizations like the American Civil Liberties [vocalized-noise] Union uh the ACLU probably have their
sw4282B-ms98-a-0040 188.584625 191.851125 sure and that that can really happen
sw4282B-ms98-a-0041 191.851125 205.987500 uh and that sort of thing not just drug testing but [noise] lots of other things uh for example blood tests that determine whether you have particularly diseases or not like AIDS uh can be construed to be an invasion of prop[erty]- or of
sw4282B-ms98-a-0042 205.987500 211.478625 of privacy because it effects your insurance and your employability and
sw4282B-ms98-a-0043 211.478625 222.620625 yeah and it's it but yet if tha[t's]- that's in any kind of a computer database [laughter] somebody's going to get access to it that and uh real easy to abuse so
sw4282B-ms98-a-0044 222.620625 227.457125 it's one of those problems that [noise] it's really hard to come up with an answer to
sw4282B-ms98-a-0045 227.457125 229.478125 and uh
sw4282B-ms98-a-0046 229.478125 231.126500 [silence]
sw4282B-ms98-a-0047 231.126500 233.702500 yeah oh yeah i[n]-
sw4282B-ms98-a-0048 233.702500 235.880500 um-hum
sw4282B-ms98-a-0049 235.880500 237.064375 [silence]
sw4282B-ms98-a-0050 237.064375 238.972250 yeah [vocalized-noise]
sw4282B-ms98-a-0051 238.972250 242.794750 oh yeah there were guys in the military that were selling their own urine
sw4282B-ms98-a-0052 242.794750 248.941375 [laughter] [laughter-because_1] [laughter-they] uh just had to be careful that they didn't do the test and uh show that you came up pregnant
sw4282B-ms98-a-0053 248.941375 255.918000 [laughter] depending on who you got your sample from it that could be really bad [laughter] [laughter-so] [laughter] but uh
sw4282B-ms98-a-0054 255.918000 258.034125 and they were really pr[otective]-
sw4282B-ms98-a-0055 258.034125 259.912375 um-hum
sw4282B-ms98-a-0056 259.912375 267.137125 well it depends now if you have a you know that was the other funny thing if you had a high security clearance like my people had
sw4282B-ms98-a-0057 267.137125 281.866875 uh and you got caught and these guys were shift workers it really worked out well for them because of course the first thing that happened was that their security clearance was suspended and then they were removed from access to sensitive information which means they got a straight day job at the company
sw4282B-ms98-a-0058 281.866875 287.250250 so i[t]- it was really to their advantage to get caught and
sw4282B-ms98-a-0059 287.250250 299.138000 yeah and in the long run of course uh that was a problem and it kind of depended also on [noise] on how often they uh were caught whether they were in a rehab program and
