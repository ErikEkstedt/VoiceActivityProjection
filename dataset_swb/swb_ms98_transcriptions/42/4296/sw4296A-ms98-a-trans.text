sw4296A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 3.837625 [noise] i think i'm probably somewhere around a five on the scale they gave uh
sw4296A-ms98-a-0002 3.837625 12.952625 um i don't like the idea of you know anyone being able to just sort of go up to a store and buy a hand gun for about uh you know forty dollars or whatever and go out and shoot someone
sw4296A-ms98-a-0003 12.952625 20.532125 but i also think that uh hunting is a legitimate use for weapons and uh i also sort of believe that
sw4296A-ms98-a-0004 20.532125 30.364125 [noise] although you know certainly our government is is very nice now i[t]- it probably doesn't hurt this sort of ultimate back up to have some so[me]- citizens to have guns if for some reason
sw4296A-ms98-a-0005 30.364125 40.515500 something ever happened and our government was run by someone who decided to make it non democratic well that's a very farfetched and you know sort of
sw4296A-ms98-a-0006 40.515500 45.922250 you know paranoid if you will possibility but you know it i guess it's it's
sw4296A-ms98-a-0007 45.922250 51.812500 i think it's i[t's]- always sort of a bad idea when the only people that have guns are the military and the police since
sw4296A-ms98-a-0008 51.812500 57.103125 [silence]
sw4296A-ms98-a-0009 57.103125 59.107875 yeah i mean i i
sw4296A-ms98-a-0010 59.107875 62.499125 [silence]
sw4296A-ms98-a-0011 62.499125 68.080375 yeah i agree completely there should be a waiting period and they should be able to do a background check on you
sw4296A-ms98-a-0012 68.080375 72.212500 [silence]
sw4296A-ms98-a-0013 72.212500 73.657000 yeah i mean most
sw4296A-ms98-a-0014 73.657000 82.853250 [silence]
sw4296A-ms98-a-0015 82.853250 84.729125 yeah i agree completely
sw4296A-ms98-a-0016 84.729125 85.775625 [silence]
sw4296A-ms98-a-0017 85.775625 90.062750 [laughter] yeah yeah yeah
sw4296A-ms98-a-0018 90.062750 97.219625 [silence]
sw4296A-ms98-a-0019 97.219625 98.949750 yeah yeah
sw4296A-ms98-a-0020 98.949750 106.290875 [silence]
sw4296A-ms98-a-0021 106.290875 107.940250 yeah that's a reasonable
sw4296A-ms98-a-0022 107.940250 109.561125 [silence]
sw4296A-ms98-a-0023 109.561125 112.169625 yeah uh i don't think so
sw4296A-ms98-a-0024 112.169625 122.767500 you need a permit to carry a concealed handgun i think in some states i think Texas might be one of those but to just carry you know one in the open or whatever is no problem
sw4296A-ms98-a-0025 122.767500 136.221250 um yeah although i uh one thing is i think no matter what rules you set unless you sort of had uh good enforcement of it it wouldn't matter i mean the types of people that cause trouble with handguns aren't the sort to care what the law is [laughter-anyway] 
sw4296A-ms98-a-0026 136.221250 146.074000 um and i'm sure they would certainly attempt to buy them on the black market so you'd need uh you know a good method of ensuring that they weren't available there which
sw4296A-ms98-a-0027 146.074000 158.293625 given the success or rather lack there of of the police in controlling the market in drugs i sort of wonder uh you know really how effective it would be but i don't i don't mean that
sw4296A-ms98-a-0028 158.293625 159.725750 yeah
sw4296A-ms98-a-0029 159.725750 165.678125 yeah i mean i don't mean it as an argument to not have waiting periods and that sort of thing but i just you know i just i think it's
sw4296A-ms98-a-0030 165.678125 171.652750 something to be aware of that it probably would not be the the ultimate solution that would solve all crime problems
sw4296A-ms98-a-0031 171.652750 174.344375 um yeah
sw4296A-ms98-a-0032 174.344375 176.766750 uh do you do you have any sort of
sw4296A-ms98-a-0033 176.766750 186.760625 you know real real life experience with uh you know either people owning guns or people being uh you know assaulted with uh guns or anything like that
sw4296A-ms98-a-0034 186.760625 188.175125 yeah
sw4296A-ms98-a-0035 188.175125 197.074625 [silence]
sw4296A-ms98-a-0036 197.074625 198.727500 yeah
sw4296A-ms98-a-0037 198.727500 204.312125 [silence]
sw4296A-ms98-a-0038 204.312125 207.959250 yeah my dad hunted when he was young although he didn't um
sw4296A-ms98-a-0039 207.959250 217.075250 by the time i came along so we d[idn't]- we didn't have guns in in our house he left them at uh his parents house so you know i got to see them or whatever
sw4296A-ms98-a-0040 217.075250 222.752875 but uh i do uh uh another student who i didn't know personally
sw4296A-ms98-a-0041 222.752875 230.562000 at Rice uh but uh it's not that s[mall]- that uh [laughter] large a community uh [laughter-about] a week ago
sw4296A-ms98-a-0042 230.562000 238.654375 uh was shot in the head with a gun [noise] yeah um he was you know going home sort of late at night after studying and uh
sw4296A-ms98-a-0043 238.654375 245.506000 you know robbers said you know i guess he was on a motorcycle and he had a his motorcycle helmet on which saved his life um because
sw4296A-ms98-a-0044 245.506000 254.491625 they said you know we want your money you know we have gun or whatever so he was like okay here have my money you know i'll lie on the ground i'll do whatever you say [laughter-i'll] i'm not going to put up any fight whatsoever
sw4296A-ms98-a-0045 254.491625 268.605625 and uh apparently there were two guys and one of them was really kind of jumpy and the other seemed kind of uh relaxed so he said to the relaxed guy hey you know please tell your friend not to shoot me you know but uh apparently the other guy for whatever reason uh shot him anyway
sw4296A-ms98-a-0046 268.605625 269.803500 and uh
sw4296A-ms98-a-0047 269.803500 283.835625 thanks to the fact hi[s]- his motorcycle helmet was made out of Kevlar which is the same thing that bullet proof vest are made out of and so uh you know he was shot in the head but he was unharmed you know i mean i think i think he might've gone to the hospital anyway just to you know be looked at but
sw4296A-ms98-a-0048 283.835625 288.644625 um he didn't even have a concussion or or anything like that
sw4296A-ms98-a-0049 288.644625 289.948875 but uh
sw4296A-ms98-a-0050 289.948875 291.961625 so it's kind of scary
sw4296A-ms98-a-0051 291.961625 295.049500 living at um Houston's got a lot of crime
sw4296A-ms98-a-0052 295.049500 298.850000 [silence]
