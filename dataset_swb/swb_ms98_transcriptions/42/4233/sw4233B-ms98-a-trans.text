sw4233B-ms98-a-0004 9.594500 21.393125 [silence]
sw4233B-ms98-a-0005 21.393125 23.233750 is it mandatory
sw4233B-ms98-a-0006 23.233750 25.228250 is it mandatory
sw4233B-ms98-a-0007 25.228250 36.227625 [silence]
sw4233B-ms98-a-0008 36.227625 37.560000 uh-huh

sw4233B-ms98-a-0013 68.398750 69.644625 [silence]
sw4233B-ms98-a-0014 69.644625 78.401500 well Ted down here we've had the uh containers available in you know various public places now since the mid seventies 
sw4233B-ms98-a-0015 78.401500 83.606875 but just in the last few days there's been a proposal now to have uh
sw4233B-ms98-a-0016 83.606875 89.997250 i believe it's about six ti[mes]- four to six times a month they'll have a curb pick-up they'll give you containers 
sw4233B-ms98-a-0017 89.997250 93.903375 that are color coded so you can put cans and glass and 
sw4233B-ms98-a-0018 93.903375 97.679625 but the difference is we have to pay for that
sw4233B-ms98-a-0019 97.679625 108.012000 about three dollars and um twenty cents or so or something like that i i was about half asleep when they were talking about it on the news but um 
sw4233B-ms98-a-0020 108.012000 109.460000 [silence]
sw4233B-ms98-a-0021 109.460000 115.013500 it is not going to go over too well as long as you have to pay a premium to participate i don't believe
sw4233B-ms98-a-0022 115.013500 120.151000 [silence]
sw4233B-ms98-a-0023 120.151000 129.441500 well the garbage rates here are high however as long as you bag it in plastic bags you can put out up to ten or twelve bags of of trash
sw4233B-ms98-a-0024 129.441500 135.807000 [silence]
sw4233B-ms98-a-0025 135.807000 137.146250 uh-huh
sw4233B-ms98-a-0026 137.146250 156.673000 [silence]
sw4233B-ms98-a-0027 156.673000 159.968000 i suspect we're having some of that here too 
sw4233B-ms98-a-0028 159.968000 184.739375 [silence] 
sw4233B-ms98-a-0029 184.739375 185.946000 yes
sw4233B-ms98-a-0030 185.946000 187.024250 [silence]
sw4233B-ms98-a-0031 187.024250 192.554000 well we've had some what the same problem here i think newsprint's down something like um
sw4233B-ms98-a-0032 192.554000 196.586750 under a dollar now per hundred weight
sw4233B-ms98-a-0033 196.586750 201.885625 and it used to be two and three and i think it even got above three at one point
sw4233B-ms98-a-0034 201.885625 203.867000 [silence]
sw4233B-ms98-a-0035 203.867000 206.782250 yes yes
sw4233B-ms98-a-0036 206.782250 215.550125 there used to be a recycling center where you'd take things in and you know they'd weigh it and pay you and they had paper and of course aluminum cans which are still very viable here 
sw4233B-ms98-a-0037 215.550125 220.093625 and they had uh clear glass and colored glass 
sw4233B-ms98-a-0038 220.093625 223.409875 but i noticed recently that place has closed up
sw4233B-ms98-a-0039 223.409875 227.907875 now my daughter's really a[ctive]- active in some of this and she there's a place
sw4233B-ms98-a-0040 227.907875 232.757750 oh about eight or nine m[iles]- well i guess it's about six miles from here where you can go and
sw4233B-ms98-a-0041 232.757750 237.341750 uh few things they pay you for most things they just take
sw4233B-ms98-a-0042 237.341750 239.089500 but um
sw4233B-ms98-a-0043 239.089500 243.255875 the movement here has not really progressed there's
sw4233B-ms98-a-0044 243.255875 247.735500 Texas is always slow on a lot of these things
sw4233B-ms98-a-0045 247.735500 253.062000 [silence]
sw4233B-ms98-a-0046 253.062000 257.115750 um yeah that was kind of disastrous
sw4233B-ms98-a-0047 257.115750 261.809500 o[f]- c[ourse]- we've had um major problems with them
sw4233B-ms98-a-0048 261.809500 267.662125 driving while intoxicated and all that i think they're finally starting to get things a little a little more squared away
sw4233B-ms98-a-0049 267.662125 273.059125 but they're a long way from that yet uh Texas has always had a tradition of uh
sw4233B-ms98-a-0050 273.059125 280.527750 people staying away from i mean law[s]- the laws really leaving you alone unless you were clearly doing something
sw4233B-ms98-a-0051 280.527750 281.586500 [silence]
sw4233B-ms98-a-0052 281.586500 282.782000 yes
sw4233B-ms98-a-0053 282.782000 284.236125 [silence]
sw4233B-ms98-a-0054 284.236125 287.045375 just recently there there now uh
sw4233B-ms98-a-0055 287.045375 294.969500 well up until recently you could have a a rifle behind the seat of your pickup and all that kind of stuff and now they're starting to discourage you from that um
sw4233B-ms98-a-0056 294.969500 297.634000 and in there's parts of town here now wh[ere]-
