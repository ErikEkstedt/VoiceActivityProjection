sw4233A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 9.083500 okay well um let's see
sw4233A-ms98-a-0002 9.083500 19.097750 well um yeah possibly um i'm not familiar with the laws in Texas but we've got a citywide recycling program here in Seattle that's um
sw4233A-ms98-a-0003 19.097750 24.312000 uh w[ell]- well it's it's it's really amazing how ma[ny]- what's that
sw4233A-ms98-a-0004 24.312000 34.006750 um [noise] well they give you really good incentives [laughter] uh they pick up the recycled goods they give you they drop off containers at your house
sw4233A-ms98-a-0005 34.006750 38.693125 so it's like it's like garbage collection um and you don't pay for it
sw4233A-ms98-a-0006 38.693125 40.968750 and uh you s[ame]- 
sw4233A-ms98-a-0007 40.968750 50.380250 uh basically at the same time they jack the garbage rates way up [laughter-and] and made it so you had to have city provided garbage cans that were of uniform size 
sw4233A-ms98-a-0008 50.380250 56.464000 so we were amazed when we you know recycling's one of these things that we did kind of once and awhile but it was
sw4233A-ms98-a-0009 56.464000 61.309125 uh you know something that i always put off because_1 you had to haul the stuff and 
sw4233A-ms98-a-0010 61.309125 66.175500 and so i you know we didn't do it much but i was amazed at how much we reduced
sw4233A-ms98-a-0011 66.175500 67.760500 the uh
sw4233A-ms98-a-0012 67.760500 70.014375 the uh the volume of our trash
sw4233A-ms98-a-0013 70.014375 92.602500 [silence]
sw4233A-ms98-a-0014 92.602500 94.838250 yeah it's like what we have yeah
sw4233A-ms98-a-0015 94.838250 97.016625 [silence]
sw4233A-ms98-a-0016 97.016625 99.129250 oh really [laughter]
sw4233A-ms98-a-0017 99.129250 114.877750 [silence]
sw4233A-ms98-a-0018 114.877750 120.351500 yeah unless they structure the garbage rates so that uh you know it like works out to be cheaper 
sw4233A-ms98-a-0019 120.351500 127.855625 [silence]
sw4233A-ms98-a-0020 127.855625 137.033375 oh my yeah they stopped that here they used to have it so that like you could get two can service and you could have huge cans you know that you furnished yourself 
sw4233A-ms98-a-0021 137.033375 147.695500 and then you could put a bag out with each can and in fact if you put out more than that they'd pick it up anyway and now they've [laughter-really] tightened up course there's some down sides to this too um 
sw4233A-ms98-a-0022 147.695500 153.823125 there's i don't i- i don't know i hear that there's more of a problem with illegal dumping 
sw4233A-ms98-a-0023 153.823125 157.202875 after this when it you know after the rates went up 
sw4233A-ms98-a-0024 157.202875 158.274625 a[nd]- 
sw4233A-ms98-a-0025 158.274625 159.330750 [silence]
sw4233A-ms98-a-0026 159.330750 171.380000 yeah and then uh the other thing is what do they do with all the [laughter-stuff] [laughter-they're] [laughter-just] [laughter-they're] [laughter-going] [laughter-to] [laughter-recycle] they now have this huge glut of paper 
sw4233A-ms98-a-0027 171.380000 180.675250 um and it's difficult to find markets for it so the as a result the um price of
sw4233A-ms98-a-0028 180.675250 187.483250 recycled paper has gone way down because you know there isn't there isn't enough demand for it all
sw4233A-ms98-a-0029 187.483250 194.928250 [silence]
sw4233A-ms98-a-0030 194.928250 195.902250 [vocalized-noise]
