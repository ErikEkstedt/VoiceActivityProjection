sw4229A-ms98-a-0019 48.599250 49.836625 well
sw4229A-ms98-a-0020 49.836625 53.472750 to be honest with you i'm not i'm not sure that my
sw4229A-ms98-a-0021 53.472750 60.737500 my feelings back then are valid or are to be modeled because i was so young um i guess 
sw4229A-ms98-a-0022 60.737500 66.583875 i guess if i had to look at it again i would probably want want to pick a school that 
sw4229A-ms98-a-0023 66.583875 74.415500 uh number one had a good financial aid department uh the school i've been at does not i mean yeah it's okay but
sw4229A-ms98-a-0024 74.415500 78.676500 well they they tend to lose things [laughter] 
sw4229A-ms98-a-0025 78.676500 79.397125 [silence]
sw4229A-ms98-a-0026 79.397125 85.027625 [laughter] yeah uh they lost my transcripts about four times and [noise]
sw4229A-ms98-a-0027 85.027625 96.136500 yeah that's real frustrating um that's that's one aspect of it i think something that's really important is for the school to have a good library
sw4229A-ms98-a-0028 96.136500 98.733750 [silence]
sw4229A-ms98-a-0029 98.733750 100.089000 [noise] yeah

sw4229A-ms98-a-0044 137.935625 141.199750 so you actually got some kind of feel for what the faculty
sw4229A-ms98-a-0045 141.199750 142.397375 histories were
sw4229A-ms98-a-0046 142.397375 146.939000 [silence]
sw4229A-ms98-a-0047 146.939000 148.183875 right

sw4229A-ms98-a-0057 174.500375 175.691375 right
sw4229A-ms98-a-0058 175.691375 180.455125 sounds similar to what most schools do in i[n]- on a graduate level
sw4229A-ms98-a-0059 180.455125 186.425500 um where as it sounds like A&M does it more or does it also on an undergraduate level
sw4229A-ms98-a-0060 186.425500 188.231750 so
sw4229A-ms98-a-0061 188.231750 201.629500 [silence]
sw4229A-ms98-a-0062 201.629500 202.657500 right

sw4229A-ms98-a-0066 218.244625 219.963625 yeah

sw4229A-ms98-a-0068 222.501875 225.800375 [silence]
sw4229A-ms98-a-0069 225.800375 229.777375 yeah that's that's another thing i wanted to emphasize is that
sw4229A-ms98-a-0070 229.777375 233.657375 if and if and when i ever get to the point to where i'm looking for schools
sw4229A-ms98-a-0071 233.657375 234.948750 uh
sw4229A-ms98-a-0072 234.948750 238.284625 i think i'm gonna opt for a larger one 
sw4229A-ms98-a-0073 238.284625 248.311000 just because i i think it forces people forces students to be a little more independent i know that i myself went to two schools as an undergrad
sw4229A-ms98-a-0074 248.311000 250.796375 one was small one was not small
sw4229A-ms98-a-0075 250.796375 251.922125 and
sw4229A-ms98-a-0076 251.922125 258.531875 i really think i learned more at the one that was not small because so much of the things i had to do on my own
sw4229A-ms98-a-0077 258.531875 261.935375 and i learned a little bit more about the system in general
sw4229A-ms98-a-0078 261.935375 267.482125 and more about myself um being able to handle the situations that i came into
sw4229A-ms98-a-0079 267.482125 275.450000 [silence]
sw4229A-ms98-a-0080 275.450000 276.977875 right um-hum

sw4229A-ms98-a-0082 281.118875 288.702375 exactly it's it's an active state it's not something that you can kind of you know be passively involved in and expect to do 
sw4229A-ms98-a-0083 288.702375 290.762250 any good really i don't think
sw4229A-ms98-a-0084 290.762250 292.188750 [silence]
sw4229A-ms98-a-0085 292.188750 293.063875 yeah
