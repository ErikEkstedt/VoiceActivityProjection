sw4278A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 10.290375 [noise] oh sure i guess this sort of relevant for me because_1 i'm a college student so you know i would have been affected by it you know a couple years ago i guess probably or after i graduate i don't know how it would be set up
sw4278A-ms98-a-0002 10.290375 14.716750 um i have sort of mixed feelings about the whole thing i mean i think it would sort of be
sw4278A-ms98-a-0003 14.716750 15.792250 [silence]
sw4278A-ms98-a-0004 15.792250 23.947500 uh sort of a bonding experience in a sense for people in the country and the you know people of of uh sort of all different uh
sw4278A-ms98-a-0005 23.947500 35.967875 you know socioeconomic racial uh you know geographic even uh you know groups who would be mixed together and would sort of work together which i think would be a positive thing
sw4278A-ms98-a-0006 35.967875 37.985500 [silence]
sw4278A-ms98-a-0007 37.985500 43.133750 yeah i mean i you know i think i think that that that would be a very probably the most positive part of it
sw4278A-ms98-a-0008 43.133750 47.008500 and you know it's also good to do uh to do volunteer work
sw4278A-ms98-a-0009 47.008500 54.175000 but on the other side i sort of you know wonder whether or not the government uh would run a program like this intelligently i mean
sw4278A-ms98-a-0010 54.175000 68.157625 [silence]
sw4278A-ms98-a-0011 68.157625 74.062625 yeah i mean the for example the Peace Corps has been a real success i think but the problem with that is that
sw4278A-ms98-a-0012 74.062625 88.623000 uh y[ou]- you know it's a it's a small program and i don't know whether they could find worthwhile work um for everyone in the country sort of uh and also you know and still still manage it well i think they might be tempted for example to
sw4278A-ms98-a-0013 88.623000 100.293000 to not spend as much money as they should i mean they'd say look we have all this free labor let's not spend any money and so they would end up using people and their talents very inefficiently
sw4278A-ms98-a-0014 100.293000 107.243250 [silence]
sw4278A-ms98-a-0015 107.243250 109.238500 yeah
sw4278A-ms98-a-0016 109.238500 112.275375 [silence]
sw4278A-ms98-a-0017 112.275375 121.792375 yeah i mean i think yeah again if i[t]- if the if it was used efficiently and people you know worked on on real problems as opposed to just sort of make work
sw4278A-ms98-a-0018 121.792375 125.479250 then uh i think it could have very positive impact
sw4278A-ms98-a-0019 125.479250 131.486000 um i just i haven't seen i haven't seen any of the detailed proposals for that i don't have you
sw4278A-ms98-a-0020 131.486000 135.987375 i mean i know people sort of floated the idea around but um
sw4278A-ms98-a-0021 135.987375 138.444125 i don't really know that much about it
sw4278A-ms98-a-0022 138.444125 161.038875 [silence]
sw4278A-ms98-a-0023 161.038875 162.454750 hm
sw4278A-ms98-a-0024 162.454750 185.111875 [silence]
sw4278A-ms98-a-0025 185.111875 186.479375 hm
sw4278A-ms98-a-0026 186.479375 193.925625 [silence]
sw4278A-ms98-a-0027 193.925625 203.120750 yeah and th[e]- part of the problem i mean e[ven]- even i think probably a little bit of the problem with the military is that you know people only stay for a few years a lot of the people and so there's not
sw4278A-ms98-a-0028 203.120750 204.489250 [silence]
sw4278A-ms98-a-0029 204.489250 217.133500 yeah and there but there's no sort of continuity to it i mean you don't have people that sort of feel responsible for uh you know the area they're working or whatever i think you'd have that problem even worse if people were only in for a year
sw4278A-ms98-a-0030 217.133500 218.831875 and they probably wouldn't
sw4278A-ms98-a-0031 218.831875 220.363875 [silence]
sw4278A-ms98-a-0032 220.363875 228.112375 yeah and they and they probably wouldn't hire enough permanent personnel to really you know make the glue to keep the whole thing functioning well
sw4278A-ms98-a-0033 228.112375 239.529750 um so i yeah i i don't know i mean i i think if if it could be made to work well it would be a good idea if it would just be sort of a giant waste of people's time
sw4278A-ms98-a-0034 239.529750 244.249000 then i think it would be you know exactly that a waste of time and money
sw4278A-ms98-a-0035 244.249000 257.304250 [silence]
sw4278A-ms98-a-0036 257.304250 258.880375 yeah i
sw4278A-ms98-a-0037 258.880375 264.795500 yeah i do think i mean i do think that's that's one part of it you would have to pay people i mean
sw4278A-ms98-a-0038 264.795500 271.586250 and either that or you know sort of like the mi[litary]- i mean the military doesn't pay people very much but you know they provide housing or whatever i mean
sw4278A-ms98-a-0039 271.586250 272.596250 [silence]
sw4278A-ms98-a-0040 272.596250 278.419750 yeah you've got to be able to you know to pay people to live more or less i mean you can't expect them
sw4278A-ms98-a-0041 278.419750 281.611250 [silence]
sw4278A-ms98-a-0042 281.611250 289.794125 yeah yeah you nee[d]- you need to uh you need to provide a way for people to li[ve]- so for that reason alone it would be it would be expensive
sw4278A-ms98-a-0043 289.794125 294.520875 um and so maybe that's almost one of the big drawbacks to it
sw4278A-ms98-a-0044 294.520875 299.682000 [silence]
