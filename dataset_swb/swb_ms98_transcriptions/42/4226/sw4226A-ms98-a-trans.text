sw4226A-ms98-a-0003 1.331500 3.331750 [laughter]
sw4226A-ms98-a-0004 3.331750 6.018000 uh how do you feel about capital punishment
sw4226A-ms98-a-0005 6.018000 19.656250 [silence]
sw4226A-ms98-a-0006 19.656250 20.912375 huh
sw4226A-ms98-a-0007 20.912375 30.636125 [silence]
sw4226A-ms98-a-0008 30.636125 36.090125 yeah i have no idea what the law is anywhere i've ever lived [laughter-i] [laughter-just]
sw4226A-ms98-a-0009 36.090125 38.124625 i don't know so
sw4226A-ms98-a-0010 38.124625 42.947750 i i personally uh even though
sw4226A-ms98-a-0011 42.947750 50.562125 i understand the principle behind capital punishment i don't agree with it ever a[pplying]- applying capital punishment to anyone
sw4226A-ms98-a-0012 50.562125 62.319625 um because_1 i sort of believe that if we've got a person arrested that sure we can uh we can say you know it's a murderer he's done heinous crimes
sw4226A-ms98-a-0013 62.319625 68.446250 but we can keep him in jail for the rest of his life and not give him a terribly pleasant existence
sw4226A-ms98-a-0014 68.446250 80.309500 and uh there's just no reason to justify killing a person a[nd]- you know there may be an economic reason but i don't think that's sufficient to justify uh killing someone
sw4226A-ms98-a-0015 80.309500 90.481750 if you believe that killing is wrong y[ou]- you might as well apply that to you know even that s[tays]- stays true even if you're punishing someone i know that's how i feel
sw4226A-ms98-a-0016 90.481750 96.598500 [silence]
sw4226A-ms98-a-0017 96.598500 97.853625 yeah
sw4226A-ms98-a-0018 97.853625 107.009375 [silence]

sw4226A-ms98-a-0020 108.545875 110.242750 [silence]
sw4226A-ms98-a-0021 110.242750 118.942250 it's just that i feel like they don't really pose a threat if they're imprisoned you know sufficiently and
sw4226A-ms98-a-0022 118.942250 125.914375 you know i- i- i guess it would be bad if the politics ever changes and they got out for some reason but
sw4226A-ms98-a-0023 125.914375 127.083375 uh
sw4226A-ms98-a-0024 127.083375 128.366500 yeah

sw4226A-ms98-a-0028 137.020875 144.851000 but the thing is you know when these guys get out it can be so quiet you may not notice i mean if the public doesn't hear about it
sw4226A-ms98-a-0029 144.851000 150.380125 for some reason i mean the thing is Charles Manson was really publicly well know but
sw4226A-ms98-a-0030 150.380125 159.625625 if it's somebody who's you know a serial killer but he never was really in the media a lot then when he gets out he still won't be in the media
sw4226A-ms98-a-0031 159.625625 162.454000 yeah so i you know
sw4226A-ms98-a-0032 162.454000 165.557875 uh it could be bad if somebody got out i guess
