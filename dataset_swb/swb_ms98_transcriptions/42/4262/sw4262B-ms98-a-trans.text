sw4262B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.006625 [noise]
sw4262B-ms98-a-0002 1.006625 26.295875 [silence]
sw4262B-ms98-a-0003 26.295875 36.397375 oh yeah there seems to be a little bit of bias towards extracurricular stuff even all the way up through college
sw4262B-ms98-a-0004 36.397375 40.949625 gets really out of hand i'll agree with you on that one
sw4262B-ms98-a-0005 40.949625 44.172750 uh you said two things
sw4262B-ms98-a-0006 44.172750 48.234250 [silence]
sw4262B-ms98-a-0007 48.234250 54.981750 uh yeah i agree with you on that i happen to think the school system's pretty good
sw4262B-ms98-a-0008 54.981750 63.491500 and that uh the problem lies in uh teaching the kids to care and you know raising them_1 up to care
sw4262B-ms98-a-0009 63.491500 65.993250 i'm not sure how to do that
sw4262B-ms98-a-0010 65.993250 68.517750 i think uh
sw4262B-ms98-a-0011 68.517750 76.844500 you know the i mean the obvious examples are kids from broken families or families where the parents really don't care but
sw4262B-ms98-a-0012 76.844500 82.630875 but i know that a lo[t]- most parents do care and you know there's still problems
sw4262B-ms98-a-0013 82.630875 86.914250 i'm not sure what the answer there is
sw4262B-ms98-a-0014 86.914250 111.355875 [silence]
sw4262B-ms98-a-0015 111.355875 112.773375 um-hum
sw4262B-ms98-a-0016 112.773375 118.986750 [silence]
sw4262B-ms98-a-0017 118.986750 124.002625 so you like a sort of a one-on-one situation with the teacher
sw4262B-ms98-a-0018 124.002625 130.370000 [silence]
sw4262B-ms98-a-0019 130.370000 135.279750 yeah when i when i was in high school and grade school
sw4262B-ms98-a-0020 135.279750 144.630625 i noticed the classes that i got the most out of were the ones where there were a f[ew]- at least you know a few other students who were interested
sw4262B-ms98-a-0021 144.630625 147.773125 so there'd be a lively discussion in the class
sw4262B-ms98-a-0022 147.773125 158.093000 if if no one cared you know it didn't matter if the teacher was exciting or not it'd be he'd be ta[lking]- he or she'd be talking at you
sw4262B-ms98-a-0023 158.093000 160.440750 and uh
sw4262B-ms98-a-0024 160.440750 164.487625 and if the teacher was an idiot which did happen
sw4262B-ms98-a-0025 164.487625 170.767500 if the other kids were into it you know you could have a lot of fun uh with the material anyway
sw4262B-ms98-a-0026 170.767500 172.059125 [silence]
sw4262B-ms98-a-0027 172.059125 179.841500 so to me uh i'm i'm gonna go back and say it's the students have got to be looking to learn uh 
sw4262B-ms98-a-0028 179.841500 182.727250 they've got to be curious
sw4262B-ms98-a-0029 182.727250 183.965375 [silence]
sw4262B-ms98-a-0030 183.965375 188.785250 and i think that's something that the the school system really doesn't address at all
sw4262B-ms98-a-0031 188.785250 192.142000 i mean that there's a few interesting good classes
sw4262B-ms98-a-0032 192.142000 195.794625 were uh you know a teacher will come
sw4262B-ms98-a-0033 195.794625 198.958875 and really interest a kid but most of them_1
sw4262B-ms98-a-0034 198.958875 201.477750 you know it's pretty much up to the kids
sw4262B-ms98-a-0035 201.477750 205.181875 [silence]
sw4262B-ms98-a-0036 205.181875 209.268875 yeah t[o]- to be interested and you know you talk t[o]-
sw4262B-ms98-a-0037 209.268875 218.323125 you talk to people on the street and they don't know history they don't know geography and it doesn't bother them they they really don't care it's not important to them
sw4262B-ms98-a-0038 218.323125 222.587625 for some reason i mean it's it's not that they're stupid because_1 they're not
sw4262B-ms98-a-0039 222.587625 229.785875 these things that i feel are important to living in the world are not important to them
sw4262B-ms98-a-0040 229.785875 239.199625 [silence]
sw4262B-ms98-a-0041 239.199625 243.353625 yeah and people don't know this because they don't feel that it's important
sw4262B-ms98-a-0042 243.353625 244.430750 [silence]
sw4262B-ms98-a-0043 244.430750 248.284125 though that's wha[t]- okay i i editorialized i'm sorry [vocalized-noise]
sw4262B-ms98-a-0044 248.284125 254.316875 i [vocalized-noise] it seems to me that they don't feel it's important and that's why they don't know English
sw4262B-ms98-a-0045 254.316875 283.131875 [silence]
sw4262B-ms98-a-0046 283.131875 291.297375 uh yeah we're uh falling further and further behind the cutting edge apparently
sw4262B-ms98-a-0047 291.297375 295.126000 uh what are these interesting programs you mentioned
sw4262B-ms98-a-0048 295.126000 298.082000 [silence]
