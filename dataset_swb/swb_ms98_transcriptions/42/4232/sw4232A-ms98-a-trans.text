sw4232A-ms98-a-0010 36.189250 39.330500 apparently i heard about it later the guy started it
sw4232A-ms98-a-0011 39.330500 45.795000 as a on inheritance money he just wanted to have a magazine of his own and he wanted to be future oriented
sw4232A-ms98-a-0012 45.795000 57.298000 so it's really fringe science um new chemicals brain enhancement technologies virtual reality all that stuff that we're just starting to hear about this whole magazine covers it
sw4232A-ms98-a-0013 57.298000 64.951625 and then from that i can follow up on other sources and a lot of the stuff in there turns up on bulletin boards as people talk about it
sw4232A-ms98-a-0014 64.951625 69.650875 [silence]
sw4232A-ms98-a-0015 69.650875 79.142375 uh depends on what it's about and who's writing a lot of this stuff is just reporting somebody may be developing some new technology and they'll be talking about the plans for the use of it
sw4232A-ms98-a-0016 79.142375 85.199000 it's not the kind of thing that would be really talent you know it's not something that's questionable like political opinions
sw4232A-ms98-a-0017 85.199000 92.355375 it's sort of a state of technology and what are we going to do with this and what do you suppose would happen if the government got ahold of it and you know that kind of thing
sw4232A-ms98-a-0018 92.355375 95.358750 [silence]

sw4232A-ms98-a-0024 114.254750 120.523625 sometimes h[e]- that doesn't even try to be funny he just puts stuff in that strip that we're not going to see anywhere else
sw4232A-ms98-a-0025 120.523625 127.276875 and uh uh like when he was quoting an entire week from Bush's speeches and the guy was completely [laughter-incoherent]
sw4232A-ms98-a-0026 127.276875 138.472500 [laughter] i think that's when it finally they had to issue a press release that Bush was under the effect of this weird drug that uh has been banned in some European countries and that it was affecting his [laughter-speech]
sw4232A-ms98-a-0027 138.472500 139.604875 [silence]

sw4232A-ms98-a-0035 164.419500 165.402500 yeah
sw4232A-ms98-a-0036 165.402500 170.447750 i used to watch them_1 but then i caught them_1 in a bald face lie and i ha[d]- didn't really care anymore
sw4232A-ms98-a-0037 170.447750 171.598000 [silence]
sw4232A-ms98-a-0038 171.598000 177.587750 it was a long time ago they just did a hatchet job on ultra light aircraft and i used to fly one
sw4232A-ms98-a-0039 177.587750 187.844250 so i knew what i was talking about and they really i mean it was a classic case of what the conservatives accuse the liberal press of doing you know they fabricating uh
sw4232A-ms98-a-0040 187.844250 189.415375 m[aking]- making one
sw4232A-ms98-a-0041 189.415375 193.613500 picking an item out of context and blowing it up i mean it was just such a classic
sw4232A-ms98-a-0042 193.613500 196.864750 yeah they did that i[t]- who damn themselves
sw4232A-ms98-a-0043 196.864750 210.066000 [silence]
sw4232A-ms98-a-0044 210.066000 211.606875 [laughter-yeah] [laughter-really]
sw4232A-ms98-a-0045 211.606875 214.098000 and then there they are doing it too
sw4232A-ms98-a-0046 214.098000 226.541500 so you just have to watch you know you have to assume that with every story you're watching or everything you're reading what what special interest could they possibly have that they would make them slanted this particular way
sw4232A-ms98-a-0047 226.541500 232.883250 if you assume they're biased and then look for some opposite biases you get a fairly good idea of [laughter-what's] [laughter-going] [laughter-on]
sw4232A-ms98-a-0048 232.883250 241.789250 [silence]

sw4232A-ms98-a-0053 260.249375 261.286000 oh yeah
sw4232A-ms98-a-0054 261.286000 264.496875 sound bytes all they'd rather do is give you a little sound bytes
sw4232A-ms98-a-0055 264.496875 268.582375 they do i[t's]- it's so funny they talk about the liberal press but
sw4232A-ms98-a-0056 268.582375 279.667500 m[ost]- most every well virtually every TV station and almost every newspaper in the country is owned by conservative well off white businessmen
sw4232A-ms98-a-0057 279.667500 284.820125 and they have to be conservative because they have this multimillion dollar investment to protect
sw4232A-ms98-a-0058 284.820125 295.887125 and they're beholding to their advertisers they have to be conservative but the writers a reporter i mean if you're going to be in the business of reporting if you're a journalist uh you get cynical
sw4232A-ms98-a-0059 295.887125 299.714000 and uh cynicism can sometimes be confused with [laughter-liberalism]
