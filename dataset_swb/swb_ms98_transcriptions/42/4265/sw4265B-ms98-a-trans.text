sw4265B-ms98-a-0007 21.530000 26.975750 kind of funny of course i had a radical turn around in my attitude about that about four or five years ago
sw4265B-ms98-a-0008 26.975750 32.346375 and um along with some other political uh what do you call it um
sw4265B-ms98-a-0009 32.346375 36.244750 changes too i formerly was one of your typical New York left wingers

sw4265B-ms98-a-0014 48.377750 55.490750 about_1 a year ago i engaged in the arduous six month prices process of getting a fire arms license
sw4265B-ms98-a-0015 55.490750 57.946500 and um
sw4265B-ms98-a-0016 57.946500 65.930125 not long after that my wife engaged in a similar process and now when we get a chance which is entirely too infrequently we can go down to the range and shoot together
sw4265B-ms98-a-0017 65.930125 68.142250 [vocalized-noise]
sw4265B-ms98-a-0018 68.142250 69.098625 [silence]

sw4265B-ms98-a-0025 86.786250 95.307125 uh it's kind of funny because_1 um we are going out to California in a while and uh out there you can walk into apparently there are ranges where they rent which is something that to me is completely foreign
sw4265B-ms98-a-0026 95.307125 99.654625 but uh ye[ah]- i may get a chance to try out some things i've never tried out before
sw4265B-ms98-a-0027 99.654625 102.324000 ah 
sw4265B-ms98-a-0028 102.324000 103.697250 [silence]
sw4265B-ms98-a-0029 103.697250 105.082375 um-hum
sw4265B-ms98-a-0030 105.082375 111.206375 [silence]
sw4265B-ms98-a-0031 111.206375 113.077000 yeah
sw4265B-ms98-a-0032 113.077000 115.538375 [silence]
sw4265B-ms98-a-0033 115.538375 120.281250 uh for rifle and shotgun you've got to sign the federal form but that's about it
sw4265B-ms98-a-0034 120.281250 124.320875 um and i really don't know where they stand on semiautomatics these days
sw4265B-ms98-a-0035 124.320875 126.299125 uh they've been getting a lot of bad press
sw4265B-ms98-a-0036 126.299125 127.781500 um
sw4265B-ms98-a-0037 127.781500 129.265875 it's uh
sw4265B-ms98-a-0038 129.265875 136.752250 [silence]
sw4265B-ms98-a-0039 136.752250 138.014375 sounds fair
sw4265B-ms98-a-0040 138.014375 140.247250 [laughter]
sw4265B-ms98-a-0041 140.247250 141.817875 [laughter] um
sw4265B-ms98-a-0042 141.817875 142.987500 [silence]
sw4265B-ms98-a-0043 142.987500 149.695375 uh-huh well you know it um you know it's kind of interesting you say that because_1 we had a series about a year and a half ago
sw4265B-ms98-a-0044 149.695375 155.029250 of murders here four within the space of about two months
sw4265B-ms98-a-0045 155.029250 158.115625 and the profile of all of them was
sw4265B-ms98-a-0046 158.115625 163.268500 a couple got separated the guy had menacing the his ex-wife
sw4265B-ms98-a-0047 163.268500 172.333500 um they filed the court order to keep him away he got picked up once or twice and then the last time he didn't get picked up he just came in there and uh and killed the woman
sw4265B-ms98-a-0048 172.333500 177.509375 and there were four of these within a couple of months and nobody seems to connect with the idea that um
sw4265B-ms98-a-0049 177.509375 184.755375 you know there are you know tha[t]- maybe just maybe she could've uh had a better shot at it if um she'd been armed
sw4265B-ms98-a-0050 184.755375 186.656375 you know at uh
sw4265B-ms98-a-0051 186.656375 189.205250 [silence]
sw4265B-ms98-a-0052 189.205250 195.673625 um i don't think so i think that there made a strangulation or stabbing in there you know i don't know the specifics but um
sw4265B-ms98-a-0053 195.673625 198.520250 you know it uh <b_aside> what was that <e_aside>
sw4265B-ms98-a-0054 198.520250 200.860500 oh my wife is screaming shotgun
sw4265B-ms98-a-0055 200.860500 204.391500 [laughter] either go get it or uh [laughter]
sw4265B-ms98-a-0056 204.391500 206.614375 [laughter] or what um
sw4265B-ms98-a-0057 206.614375 209.355875 what do you call we had uh
sw4265B-ms98-a-0058 209.355875 211.803750 [vocalized-noise] friend of mine who would
sw4265B-ms98-a-0059 211.803750 214.470250 maybe this is fundamentally my attitude changing
sw4265B-ms98-a-0060 214.470250 218.104125 uh when he pointed out that the purpose of the police was not to prevent crime
sw4265B-ms98-a-0061 218.104125 223.654750 and uh you know that's something we all actually [vocalized-noise] except that is the purpose of the police and i said what do you mean by that
sw4265B-ms98-a-0062 223.654750 225.423500 and his comment was
sw4265B-ms98-a-0063 225.423500 233.582500 well in order to prevent a crime the police have to be where the crime is taking place now they can't be everywhere they can be very good at deterring crime
sw4265B-ms98-a-0064 233.582500 239.765750 they can be very good capturing criminals and enforcing the punishment of crime but they can't be good at preventing it
sw4265B-ms98-a-0065 239.765750 243.373000 so if the police aren't going to prevent it who is
sw4265B-ms98-a-0066 243.373000 245.377000 [silence]
sw4265B-ms98-a-0067 245.377000 251.137250 and uh i thought it was you know um um a very nice elegant piece of logic there and it's absolutely true you know it
sw4265B-ms98-a-0068 251.137250 254.681625 you know so and i imagine the more rural you get that the truer that is
sw4265B-ms98-a-0069 254.681625 261.166250 you know um kind of funny i was just looking at a book today where some fellow was sc[reaming]- his his car had been stolen
sw4265B-ms98-a-0070 261.166250 271.982250 and he was screaming at the police primarily because about two days before you know they were telling him we're spread to thin to enforce car theft and a few days before they'd given him a ticket for parking fifteen minutes late at a meter
sw4265B-ms98-a-0071 271.982250 273.024375 [silence]
sw4265B-ms98-a-0072 273.024375 275.352250 you know [vocalized-noise] a matter of priorities i guess
sw4265B-ms98-a-0073 275.352250 276.384500 [silence]
sw4265B-ms98-a-0074 276.384500 278.151750 yeah but um
sw4265B-ms98-a-0075 278.151750 279.662875 [vocalized-noise]
sw4265B-ms98-a-0076 279.662875 280.769500 [silence]
sw4265B-ms98-a-0077 280.769500 282.061875 as a matter of fact
sw4265B-ms98-a-0078 282.061875 283.305250 [vocalized-noise] yeah
sw4265B-ms98-a-0079 283.305250 288.749375 card carrying [laughter-um] it's about uh i think it was renewed for the second or third time 
sw4265B-ms98-a-0080 288.749375 290.694875 and um
sw4265B-ms98-a-0081 290.694875 292.478750 [silence]
sw4265B-ms98-a-0082 292.478750 296.978000 yeah yeah it's interesting of course one of the things that um
sw4265B-ms98-a-0083 296.978000 298.306000 yeah i- i don't know
