sw4294B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.304500 [noise]
sw4294B-ms98-a-0002 0.304500 2.450250 yeah so what do you think about that
sw4294B-ms98-a-0003 2.450250 20.448375 [silence]
sw4294B-ms98-a-0004 20.448375 22.526000 yeah the accused
sw4294B-ms98-a-0005 22.526000 39.586875 [silence]
sw4294B-ms98-a-0006 39.586875 40.998000 yeah i hear that
sw4294B-ms98-a-0007 40.998000 46.776750 the uh [noise] my problem with the courts and the that systems is just the fact that it's almost completely broken down
sw4294B-ms98-a-0008 46.776750 56.772125 most cases that go on aren't even tried but are plea bargained so that the guy can get off a certain amount of time in exchange for not spending time in the courts
sw4294B-ms98-a-0009 56.772125 58.550375 but the uh
sw4294B-ms98-a-0010 58.550375 72.595875 the worst part is that the jails are being filled with political criminals i mean since nineteen eighty six we've been undergoing a major witch hunt in this country were the question isn't who's hurt anybody but uh is the individual has been engaged in unauthorized behavior
sw4294B-ms98-a-0011 72.595875 77.497625 and we are now ahead of South Africa and Russia in locking up a higher percentage of our citizens
sw4294B-ms98-a-0012 77.497625 88.786500 than any other country on this planet we've beat even beat out the Muslim countries something is major wrong here and uh we can trace it to the right wing witch hunt there isn't any room for the real criminals
sw4294B-ms98-a-0013 88.786500 90.697250 [silence]
sw4294B-ms98-a-0014 90.697250 100.222125 uh it's when uh the government decides that a certain behavior uh shall not be authorized anymore and that anybody who is then caught doing it is guilty of violating the crime
sw4294B-ms98-a-0015 100.222125 102.624750 when in fact nobody has actually been hurt
sw4294B-ms98-a-0016 102.624750 106.956500 oh smoking weed growing marijuana patronizing prostitutes things like that
sw4294B-ms98-a-0017 106.956500 109.353000 [silence]
sw4294B-ms98-a-0018 109.353000 119.566875 well that a[s]- as as opposed to the kind of the more European political prisoners where someone actively uh speaks out and opposes the government i[f]- i[f]- i[f]- if a crime involves no complainant
sw4294B-ms98-a-0019 119.566875 124.106375 then it's the government doing the complaining and that sounds political to me
sw4294B-ms98-a-0020 124.106375 137.698625 [silence]
sw4294B-ms98-a-0021 137.698625 139.174375 um
sw4294B-ms98-a-0022 139.174375 140.296750 [silence]
sw4294B-ms98-a-0023 140.296750 153.139125 it depends on what and who uh the largest number of people who are convicted of various crimes and in jail today are drug crimes that are not accompanied by other crimes
sw4294B-ms98-a-0024 153.139125 160.600000 it's sort of a thing that because someone who is inclined to use some of the nastier drugs will then also go out an[d]- commit other crimes 
sw4294B-ms98-a-0025 160.600000 168.546750 that that means that the other crimes are no longer a valid point of contention it's sort of like saying somebody should be able to do all the Coke they want
sw4294B-ms98-a-0026 168.546750 176.165000 but as soon as they violate any other law and actually hurt somebody whether it's stealing money to get the Coke [vocalized-noise] loosing control and beating someone up
sw4294B-ms98-a-0027 176.165000 184.361750 that they should be treated the same way as someone who looses control and beats someone up without being under the influence of chemicals whose they can't use it as an excuse
sw4294B-ms98-a-0028 184.361750 185.143125 [silence]
sw4294B-ms98-a-0029 185.143125 196.619250 but the way that it's come now to the the trials and the judges it's [laughter] i[t's]- it's almost completely manipulated uh in in favor of the government's position
sw4294B-ms98-a-0030 196.619250 208.276000 so uh wh[ile]- i'm willing to sacrifice the danger of having a a few people who are guilty getting off because it's far to easy when the government decides someone did it hey they did it
sw4294B-ms98-a-0031 208.276000 219.095500 and if it and whether the innocence or guilt is true or not becomes irrelevant in fact Texas has gone totally crazy on this Texas has a guy on death row now and
sw4294B-ms98-a-0032 219.095500 224.253125 the con[victed]- convicted of a crime that someone else has come out and admitted to
sw4294B-ms98-a-0033 224.253125 233.620625 and that story has been corroborated but they're still arguing whether that's grounds for uh commuting his sentence or not because guilt or innocence is not a constitutional question
sw4294B-ms98-a-0034 233.620625 239.319000 so Texas could conceivably it's that close execute someone who they know didn't commit the crime
sw4294B-ms98-a-0035 239.319000 241.343250 because of the points of law involved
sw4294B-ms98-a-0036 241.343250 242.719250 [silence]
sw4294B-ms98-a-0037 242.719250 246.370875 so th[ere]- there's a point that's left logic and reason and broken down completely
sw4294B-ms98-a-0038 246.370875 250.930125 [silence]
sw4294B-ms98-a-0039 250.930125 256.763625 oh the jury definitely and uh whether it's unanimous or not i think that it could be uh
sw4294B-ms98-a-0040 256.763625 260.725000 th[ere]- there there needs to be lots of evidence for appealing um
sw4294B-ms98-a-0041 260.725000 272.245875 i have a friend who uh took his trial by judge and that's the worst mistake anyone can ever make because at least with the jury even though you're going to be tried by six or twelve people who weren't able to get out of jury duty
sw4294B-ms98-a-0042 272.245875 278.805125 [laughter] that's an old joke but it's still true a lot of the people who you would want to have on your jury don't want to have anything to do with it 
sw4294B-ms98-a-0043 278.805125 281.270875 so it's risky real risky
sw4294B-ms98-a-0044 281.270875 284.732000 but still i take my chance with the odds of twelve
sw4294B-ms98-a-0045 284.732000 292.078250 and we have to sacrifice letting a few people get away with things because eventually they're going to be caught then
sw4294B-ms98-a-0046 292.078250 295.689500 for my personal risk of being in the wrong place at the wrong time
sw4294B-ms98-a-0047 295.689500 299.074000 [silence]
