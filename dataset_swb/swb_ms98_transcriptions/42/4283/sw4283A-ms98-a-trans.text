sw4283A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.067375 [silence] 
sw4283A-ms98-a-0002 0.067375 1.536500 i'll start
sw4283A-ms98-a-0003 1.536500 6.430250 um my feeling is that
sw4283A-ms98-a-0004 6.430250 9.216125 you become a politician
sw4283A-ms98-a-0005 9.216125 16.391500 perhaps because um you think you're doing something noble perhaps because you're on a power trip but
sw4283A-ms98-a-0006 16.391500 21.076125 what it all comes down to is you are doing this because you think
sw4283A-ms98-a-0007 21.076125 28.281375 that your approach is better than what another person's approach is and you're looking to impose their will upon them your will upon them
sw4283A-ms98-a-0008 28.281375 30.353250 and um
sw4283A-ms98-a-0009 30.353250 32.528125 so there's a fundamental problem
sw4283A-ms98-a-0010 32.528125 36.893250 [laughter-okay] is that y[ou]- you get into this to impose your will upon others
sw4283A-ms98-a-0011 36.893250 39.060250 if you um
sw4283A-ms98-a-0012 39.060250 42.423750 could do it you know if you didn't need to impose your will
sw4283A-ms98-a-0013 42.423750 46.602500 then you could just do it by suggesting or writing articles in newspaper or what have you
sw4283A-ms98-a-0014 46.602500 59.493625 [silence]
sw4283A-ms98-a-0015 59.493625 66.393500 well i think that the uh what do you call it uh you know tho[se]- those guys who took pen to parchment a couple hundred years ago
sw4283A-ms98-a-0016 66.393500 72.739375 had some good ideas and um one of the things that i think has gotten out of hand
sw4283A-ms98-a-0017 72.739375 75.489500 is what the government does
sw4283A-ms98-a-0018 75.489500 77.693875 what kind of things they get involved it
sw4283A-ms98-a-0019 77.693875 80.432125 um there was a time when
sw4283A-ms98-a-0020 80.432125 83.892500 the governm[ent]- wou[ldn't]- wouldn't think of telling you what you could eat or smoke
sw4283A-ms98-a-0021 83.892500 88.182750 um there was a time when the government wouldn't think of um
sw4283A-ms98-a-0022 88.182750 95.915125 imposing heavy taxes on transportations o[n]- on your means of transportation to uh build uh roads where they wanted them
sw4283A-ms98-a-0023 95.915125 101.319125 and i think tho[se]- those are the first of things that come to mind i think that um
sw4283A-ms98-a-0024 101.319125 104.548875 if what the government sets out to do
sw4283A-ms98-a-0025 104.548875 106.607000 is fairly limited
sw4283A-ms98-a-0026 106.607000 111.121750 then the people who decide they want to be politicians can't get into a whole lot of trouble
sw4283A-ms98-a-0027 111.121750 112.717875 [silence]
sw4283A-ms98-a-0028 112.717875 121.724500 um it's only when you try to run every aspect of life from cradle to grave that when a politician runs amok they can do serious [laughter-damage]
sw4283A-ms98-a-0029 121.724500 125.338625 [silence]
sw4283A-ms98-a-0030 125.338625 128.191250 oh absolutely um
sw4283A-ms98-a-0031 128.191250 134.550250 you know i think that uh we've gotten ourself into a lot of trouble um i think that well
sw4283A-ms98-a-0032 134.550250 137.844250 i think that getting ourselves out of it is going to be painful
sw4283A-ms98-a-0033 137.844250 141.449625 um i hope it happens peacefully
sw4283A-ms98-a-0034 141.449625 143.456250 because it will happen
sw4283A-ms98-a-0035 143.456250 147.129125 [silence]
sw4283A-ms98-a-0036 147.129125 154.400625 well we're in a situation right now where um uh the comment uh not the first thing uh even in a situation right now where um
sw4283A-ms98-a-0037 154.400625 156.611625 [silence]
sw4283A-ms98-a-0038 156.611625 163.838125 large portions of your life are controlled by forces that aren't particularly interested in your welfare and um
sw4283A-ms98-a-0039 163.838125 167.435750 the quality of life is deteriorating uh
sw4283A-ms98-a-0040 167.435750 170.265000 [silence]
sw4283A-ms98-a-0041 170.265000 178.752500 well ta[ke]- well taking half your income is uh a pretty good one uh not being permitted to defend yourself is another one um
sw4283A-ms98-a-0042 178.752500 188.331750 i don't know what the laws are like in New York in in California but in New York um if you wake up one night and go down stairs and see a fellow about to climb out the window with your TV set
sw4283A-ms98-a-0043 188.331750 190.725875 you cannot use deadly force against them
sw4283A-ms98-a-0044 190.725875 194.691625 [silence]
sw4283A-ms98-a-0045 194.691625 196.250625 with your TV set yeah
sw4283A-ms98-a-0046 196.250625 197.517125 um
sw4283A-ms98-a-0047 197.517125 201.890000 [silence]
sw4283A-ms98-a-0048 201.890000 205.811250 um well there's an interesting issue there uh
sw4283A-ms98-a-0049 205.811250 209.732625 let's suppose someone breaks the window of your car and steals your radio
sw4283A-ms98-a-0050 209.732625 211.787000 all right um
sw4283A-ms98-a-0051 211.787000 215.522625 we look at this and we say okay fine it's
sw4283A-ms98-a-0052 215.522625 216.579500 [silence]
sw4283A-ms98-a-0053 216.579500 220.020125 three hundred dollars damage just picking a number off the top of my head
sw4283A-ms98-a-0054 220.020125 224.190125 let's suppose you make thirty five bucks an hour uh thirty bucks an hour to make the math easy
sw4283A-ms98-a-0055 224.190125 227.882500 theoretically ten working hours of your life have just vanished
sw4283A-ms98-a-0056 227.882500 235.272875 a[nd]- and and don't quo[te]- on the uh example of insurance because that [vocalized-noise] means those ten working hours of someone else's life got [laughter-vanished]
sw4283A-ms98-a-0057 235.272875 240.479375 yeah one way or another um so when material objects are destroyed
sw4283A-ms98-a-0058 240.479375 244.842625 you know it's it's it's it's y[ou]- y[ou]- you it's it's a um
sw4283A-ms98-a-0059 244.842625 252.108250 how can i better say it you know when a material object is destroyed it is a portion of one's life that's consumed if you look at it that way
sw4283A-ms98-a-0060 252.108250 255.524250 you know it's not as cut and dry and radical as uh
sw4283A-ms98-a-0061 255.524250 257.115625 [silence]
sw4283A-ms98-a-0062 257.115625 259.474875 you know as um
sw4283A-ms98-a-0063 259.474875 268.513000 when someone is killed in cold blood but uh there is a very very subtle effect there and i think one of the problems we have with law today is that
sw4283A-ms98-a-0064 268.513000 271.167375 when somebody runs out and passes a law
sw4283A-ms98-a-0065 271.167375 276.516375 be it increase in taxes be it what have you generally speaking
sw4283A-ms98-a-0066 276.516375 278.822875 um you're not creating anything
sw4283A-ms98-a-0067 278.822875 281.043625 you're just moving stuff from one place to another
sw4283A-ms98-a-0068 281.043625 282.959500 okay you're moving
sw4283A-ms98-a-0069 282.959500 289.825500 some kind of uh you know if if you um very strongly reinforce the p[articular]- e[nforce]- e[nforce]- enforce a particular um
sw4283A-ms98-a-0070 289.825500 294.554875 civil right um one of the example that comes to mind is Miranda
sw4283A-ms98-a-0071 294.554875 297.780750 okay um which i think is a good thing
sw4283A-ms98-a-0072 297.780750 299.618000 um but
