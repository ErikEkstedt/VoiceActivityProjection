sw4239B-ms98-a-0017 69.530125 70.591500 [silence]
sw4239B-ms98-a-0018 70.591500 71.636000 -[some]thing like that
sw4239B-ms98-a-0019 71.636000 74.086750 [silence]
sw4239B-ms98-a-0020 74.086750 80.432625 yeah yeah we've actually got uh see there's several different bins at the work place and at home we've got 
sw4239B-ms98-a-0021 80.432625 83.536375 several different recycling things going on and um
sw4239B-ms98-a-0022 83.536375 85.427125 uh at home
sw4239B-ms98-a-0023 85.427125 95.269500 we actually have a private sanitation company that asks us to separate out all of our stuff and they take everything from car oi[l]- you know engine oil
sw4239B-ms98-a-0024 95.269500 97.903250 which is a hard one to get get rid of
sw4239B-ms98-a-0025 97.903250 112.775500 to you know plastic milk jugs and bottles and stuff like that so we have it all sort of separated out in bags by the time he comes around he comes around a couple times a week then we have um there's a recycling center down at uh park not far from us
sw4239B-ms98-a-0026 112.775500 127.369750 uh where if you really have big loads you can go in and separate it yourself so there's all uh you know all the different ca[tegories]- categories of stuff i don't know if they break it out in plastics between milk jugs and other things but i think it's like plastics glass paper
sw4239B-ms98-a-0027 127.369750 132.254750 [noise] and then uh at work this actually kind of a funny story uh
sw4239B-ms98-a-0028 132.254750 141.325500 for a long time the the guys who ran the company i work for we're kind of resistant to uh any kind of recycling because_1 they felt like it was just going to cost them_1 money or [laughter-something]
sw4239B-ms98-a-0029 141.325500 142.492375 [laughter]
sw4239B-ms98-a-0030 142.492375 145.281500 and uh so they put up uh
sw4239B-ms98-a-0031 145.281500 155.380125 eventually you know there's enough pressure and they put up they put up a couple different uh bins one of them_1 was for paper which everybody gets everybody gets a paper bin in their office
sw4239B-ms98-a-0032 155.380125 160.984875 but there're so many restrictions on what you can toss in there that it's almost more of pain than it's worth [vocalized-noise] 
sw4239B-ms98-a-0033 160.984875 168.645125 no you know no clips no staples you know and so it's kind of it's kind of a pain you have to get get in that habit
sw4239B-ms98-a-0034 168.645125 177.455250 and uh the other ones [laughter-uh] they have for aluminum cans they also have and this is sort of the funniest part they had a styrofoam recycling thing going on
sw4239B-ms98-a-0035 177.455250 190.912125 and they were act[ually]- yeah they were actually um in the uh staff meetings that we used to have there was [laughter-this] [laughter-guy] who's job it was to sort of track that and every month he would actually report how much money 
sw4239B-ms98-a-0036 190.912125 201.471750 of this company made on recycling and so he'd say you know and i'd like to report that we made twenty five dollars and two cents
sw4239B-ms98-a-0037 201.471750 216.036625 on styrofoam cup recycling so we were we were always making jokes about you know maybe we could fold that over into computer purchases or something like that you know so by the year you know twenty fifty you know we could buy a Cray or something you know wi[th]- but uh [laughter]
sw4239B-ms98-a-0038 216.036625 217.469875 [silence]
sw4239B-ms98-a-0039 217.469875 220.114250 [noise] yep [noise] so
sw4239B-ms98-a-0040 220.114250 222.251750 [silence]
sw4239B-ms98-a-0041 222.251750 234.392625 yeah for uh w[ell]- they they actually took sort of the reverse approach to start with they just decided well we won't we won't let anybody use anything styrofoam [laughter] so they stopped buying coffee cups [laughter-and] stuff like th[at]-
sw4239B-ms98-a-0042 234.392625 240.202250 which is a real pain you know because_1 i mean not everybody uh wonders in with their coffee cup i mean a lot of us haven't been you know
sw4239B-ms98-a-0043 240.202250 242.075750 [silence]
sw4239B-ms98-a-0044 242.075750 243.294625 yeah
sw4239B-ms98-a-0045 243.294625 244.431125 yeah
sw4239B-ms98-a-0046 244.431125 255.924875 so anyway so we we have a lot of things lot of things going on i actually i'm i'm a big uh i'm a big recycling fan i think it's pretty important actually hear about all these stories about uh 
sw4239B-ms98-a-0047 255.924875 262.125750 plastics and stuff showing up out in the ocean you know choking animals and stuff like tha[t]- it's pretty pretty gory [laughter]
sw4239B-ms98-a-0048 262.125750 263.164500 [silence]
sw4239B-ms98-a-0049 263.164500 263.940375 yeah
sw4239B-ms98-a-0050 263.940375 267.623000 [silence]
sw4239B-ms98-a-0051 267.623000 268.166625 uh
sw4239B-ms98-a-0052 268.166625 270.644500 there there's actually a company out um
sw4239B-ms98-a-0053 270.644500 276.404000 uh straight west of us in Strasburg Virginia that makes arm rests for cars
sw4239B-ms98-a-0054 276.404000 283.872500 in mass quantities in fact virtually every piece of trim that you see on the inside of your car Japanese or American these guys make
sw4239B-ms98-a-0055 283.872500 290.090125 and uh so it's a giant plastics pla[nt]- i think they have a se[venty]- like a seventy five percent market share or something
sw4239B-ms98-a-0056 290.090125 291.558625 [silence]
sw4239B-ms98-a-0057 291.558625 296.208375 uh i think they use a lot of recycled plastic but the funny thing about it is
sw4239B-ms98-a-0058 296.208375 297.986000 is that they have because of cer[tain]-
