sw4239A-ms98-a-0002 0.149125 11.591500 well the main uh two recycling efforts i see in this neighborhood are at work um somebody got the idea of collecting all the phone books together and it's probably several tons of them_1
sw4239A-ms98-a-0003 11.591500 19.396250 and uh white paper computer paper and stuff like that and the other one would be the local grocery stores have got um
sw4239A-ms98-a-0004 19.396250 31.653750 newspaper bins i just recently noticed a magazine bin which is really nice and now i've got a place to dump all these things but a really prominent sign is that until recently they accepted those plastic milk jugs
sw4239A-ms98-a-0005 31.653750 39.045000 and they're probably the main you know source of those things in the first place but they've quit taking those now
sw4239A-ms98-a-0006 39.045000 41.013875 which is a little disturbing

sw4239A-ms98-a-0008 42.953750 54.576625 i don't know i was under the impression that they were converting or that the two liter plastic bottles could be um chipped down and used for a lot of things like uh carpet industry's pretty big in the northern part of the state here
sw4239A-ms98-a-0009 54.576625 66.089625 and i've heard that some of the companies make their carpets completely from that stuff but i don't know if there's any use for those strange opaque milk carton type um plastic jugs or not
sw4239A-ms98-a-0010 66.089625 69.937875 [silence]
