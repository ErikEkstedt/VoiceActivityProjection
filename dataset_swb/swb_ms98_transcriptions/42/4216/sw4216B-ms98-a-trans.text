sw4216B-ms98-a-0033 133.438125 137.027750 a home budget and what not i stopped and thought to myself
sw4216B-ms98-a-0034 137.027750 141.410750 geez we don't have a [laughter] or turns out that you know
sw4216B-ms98-a-0035 141.410750 144.364250 uh my wife and i also work
sw4216B-ms98-a-0036 144.364250 154.832500 and uh she work for the federal government and i work almost for the federal [laughter-government] and but it's you know fixed income basically you know from pay check to pay check how much you're going to get
sw4216B-ms98-a-0037 154.832500 156.286750 and
sw4216B-ms98-a-0038 156.286750 159.414375 uh i'm the only guy that pays any bills
sw4216B-ms98-a-0039 159.414375 174.163875 i mean she carries the check book but when it comes time [vocalized-noise] everybody who mails a bill like gas company and the telephone and all of that kind of stuff comes to the house and one of them gets plopped in to my mailbox and then once a week or once every two weeks i'll sit down and and write checks
sw4216B-ms98-a-0040 174.163875 178.728000 well just recently we've we've found out that um
sw4216B-ms98-a-0041 178.728000 184.080375 we've had her money direct deposited to one account and my money direct deposited to another account
sw4216B-ms98-a-0042 184.080375 191.213750 correct and we've been trying to live off my money which is not working [laughter-out]
sw4216B-ms98-a-0043 191.213750 197.277375 exactly we've been trying to well basically we wanted to use her money just to pay the mortgage on the house
sw4216B-ms98-a-0044 197.277375 205.193375 you know that was that way we wouldn't have to worry about the mortgage it would be covered and then we would have our living expenses on mine
sw4216B-ms98-a-0045 205.193375 214.601250 and it just hasn't work out you know and it i i've read these budget book and they say well you know you sit down and you figure out how much it's costing you to live and all that kind of stuff but
sw4216B-ms98-a-0046 214.601250 220.578125 uh what i've notice is that it's extremely difficult for us to come up with a
sw4216B-ms98-a-0047 220.578125 229.752875 uh it u[sually]- it it well co[st]- it cost us you know uh five hundred dollars a month to live it doesn't work that [vocalized-noise] one month it's five hundred the next month it's
sw4216B-ms98-a-0048 229.752875 244.376250 it's a thousand because you get the car insurance bill and then and then it goes down to two hundred because uh you're off on vacation or something or you know you you went traveling and and you didn't spend as much but then you come back and it goes up again and i mean it's uh that's been my problem
