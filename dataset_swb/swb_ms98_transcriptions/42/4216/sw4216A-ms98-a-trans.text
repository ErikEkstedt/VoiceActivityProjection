sw4216A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.973625 [noise] 
sw4216A-ms98-a-0002 0.973625 3.407750 okay i guess we can just go ahead and start
sw4216A-ms98-a-0003 3.407750 12.419875 so what i did while they were uh a matter they i made some notes while they were calling around and they called quite a few different number before anybody answered
sw4216A-ms98-a-0004 12.419875 19.253625 is uh some notes that i wrote down about our budget and that is uh the biggest problem that we have is that
sw4216A-ms98-a-0005 19.253625 29.300500 uh my wife and i both work and i get a fixed amount and i'm paid once every two weeks and my pay check always the same
sw4216A-ms98-a-0006 29.300500 35.450750 she also get paid once every two weeks but her pay checks don't come at the same time mine do
sw4216A-ms98-a-0007 35.450750 40.044125 and she doesn't get a fixed amount every everytime she gets paid
sw4216A-ms98-a-0008 40.044125 52.724625 and so trying to put together a budget from pay dates that are different and change all the time and where her amount change uh has been probably been one of the biggest budget problems that that we have
sw4216A-ms98-a-0009 52.724625 65.245125 and uh so what we've done is kind of taken everything that we have had to pay out over a an extended period of time and then tried to average it
sw4216A-ms98-a-0010 65.245125 75.765000 so that we could approximate how much each bill would be and then budget our pay checks accordingly base on the minimum amount that we would expect to receive
sw4216A-ms98-a-0011 75.765000 78.661250 and that's that's been fairly effective
sw4216A-ms98-a-0012 78.661250 80.458250 [silence]
sw4216A-ms98-a-0013 80.458250 84.810125 hum you mean like recently [laughter] right
sw4216A-ms98-a-0014 84.810125 89.916125 [silence]
sw4216A-ms98-a-0015 89.916125 101.572500 exactly and that's uh that recently happen we had to have break jobs on both of our cars and uh so then we end up doing a couple of things uh dipping into saving is one 
sw4216A-ms98-a-0016 101.572500 112.843625 and uh scrimping on other thing to uh get the extra money and then uh also we've got uh a an investment plan with a mutual fund
sw4216A-ms98-a-0017 112.843625 122.458500 and that's kind of like a savings account so between all of those varies sources and uh that is obviously not a very good way of doing thing
sw4216A-ms98-a-0018 122.458500 124.983000 so uh
sw4216A-ms98-a-0019 124.983000 126.692000 no
sw4216A-ms98-a-0020 126.692000 128.158500 right

sw4216A-ms98-a-0063 244.006875 254.902000 we've got bill for example like the uh car insurance you mentioned that come and and this is the other problem when it comes to budgeting is that we have bills that don't come on a
sw4216A-ms98-a-0064 254.902000 263.056875 uh monthly or or once every two week bases like we get paid the the car insurance comes every three months
sw4216A-ms98-a-0065 263.056875 271.609750 so that means that uh uh everytime because we haven't uh disciplined ourselves where we can have a uh
sw4216A-ms98-a-0066 271.609750 276.817375 certain amount set aside each month for when that bill comes we end up
sw4216A-ms98-a-0067 276.817375 282.525375 paying that whole bill every every three or four month and then that cuts into everything else on it
