sw4211B-ms98-a-0003 4.152250 5.586125 well
sw4211B-ms98-a-0004 5.586125 8.735875 i'm not so that i am not willing to send my kids to them
sw4211B-ms98-a-0005 8.735875 9.969125 [silence]
sw4211B-ms98-a-0006 9.969125 19.262000 yeah now that's partly because i want my children to have a religious education uh which a public school can not and should not
sw4211B-ms98-a-0007 19.262000 24.894750 offer uh but it's also because
sw4211B-ms98-a-0008 24.894750 26.092625 [silence]
sw4211B-ms98-a-0009 26.092625 32.006125 i fill that they'll get a better education i fill that i have more control over
sw4211B-ms98-a-0010 32.006125 35.557750 uh the type of social
sw4211B-ms98-a-0011 35.557750 36.569125 [silence]
sw4211B-ms98-a-0012 36.569125 41.812875 pressure that they get expose to because i can choose
sw4211B-ms98-a-0013 41.812875 43.045500 [silence]
sw4211B-ms98-a-0014 43.045500 51.708875 you know if the kinds of essential not only am i choosing the kind of schooling that they're getting but i am also choosing the other kinds of children who are going to be there because
sw4211B-ms98-a-0015 51.708875 52.830125 [silence]
sw4211B-ms98-a-0016 52.830125 58.999875 it works both you know because not only am i doing this but presuming the other parents are doing the same thing 
sw4211B-ms98-a-0017 58.999875 60.114250 [silence]
sw4211B-ms98-a-0018 60.114250 61.265875 yeah
sw4211B-ms98-a-0019 61.265875 62.490875 yeah
sw4211B-ms98-a-0020 62.490875 108.022500 [silence]
sw4211B-ms98-a-0021 108.022500 108.987875 yeah
sw4211B-ms98-a-0022 108.987875 110.722875 [silence]
sw4211B-ms98-a-0023 110.722875 111.803000 yeah
sw4211B-ms98-a-0024 111.803000 130.746625 [silence]
sw4211B-ms98-a-0025 130.746625 136.025625 well i think i- i think that that works too uh
sw4211B-ms98-a-0026 136.025625 137.796750 [silence]
sw4211B-ms98-a-0027 137.796750 139.567875 you know i
sw4211B-ms98-a-0028 139.567875 141.343000 [silence]
sw4211B-ms98-a-0029 141.343000 151.912375 i sometimes wonder there a a school system near me that they actually a fairly good one what they've done is they had one school that was
sw4211B-ms98-a-0030 151.912375 166.519500 because of the neighborhood the neighborhood school system basic the school system basically and they put their talented and gifted program in the poorest school district you know the or the poo[rest]- poorest elementary district that was part of this larger district
sw4211B-ms98-a-0031 166.519500 178.141375 and um they allowed any of those neighborhood children who wanted to stay there to stay and then they didn't it wasn't that they had the talented and gifted program just housed in this building
sw4211B-ms98-a-0032 178.141375 189.764125 all of the classes were based on talented and gifted and all the kids were treated the same way and as a result this is now the best school in the school district which is really kind of interesting 
sw4211B-ms98-a-0033 189.764125 195.883875 well it's essentially a magnetic school that's right but it's also a neighborhood school you know and 
sw4211B-ms98-a-0034 195.883875 201.891500 the neigh[borhood]- there are some of the neighborhood kids who can't manage and
sw4211B-ms98-a-0035 201.891500 205.460500 the talented and gifted program because
sw4211B-ms98-a-0036 205.460500 208.660500 and i think it's more case of
sw4211B-ms98-a-0037 208.660500 216.018125 you know there are some children in this world who i accuse of perhaps [vocalized-noise] you know and and they just 
sw4211B-ms98-a-0038 216.018125 229.729375 not only can not compete they simple didn't you know those kids really felt uncomfortable but the majority of kids if they're taught the way that they teach talented and gifted kids it turns out the majority of kids really are that way
sw4211B-ms98-a-0039 229.729375 240.567500 you know each one a little bit different but each one has a lot to offer so that's a public school that works but then there are other public schools in that same district that really don't work 
sw4211B-ms98-a-0040 240.567500 242.277500 and
sw4211B-ms98-a-0041 242.277500 243.557375 [silence]
sw4211B-ms98-a-0042 243.557375 249.228375 and unfortunately even that school although it seems to be working academically has
sw4211B-ms98-a-0043 249.228375 250.277000 [silence]
sw4211B-ms98-a-0044 250.277000 260.375875 some um some real race problems that uh which is real unfortunate because_1 most of the kids who comes in are white and most of the kids who are there are black or
sw4211B-ms98-a-0045 260.375875 279.024250 [silence]
sw4211B-ms98-a-0046 279.024250 280.196875 yeah
sw4211B-ms98-a-0047 280.196875 285.682375 yeah i think you right i think you right and i think that a caring teacher
sw4211B-ms98-a-0048 285.682375 299.074000 can do a lot to change that but then you are not talking about is it a public school is it a private school is it you talking about you know are you and the kids are going to be lucky enough to hit the teacher who can get home
