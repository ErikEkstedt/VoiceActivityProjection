sw4270B-ms98-a-0003 7.286500 18.036500 oh that's a very interesting question the answer that i have is no in fact um i was selected for jury at one time but uh fortunately for me or unfortunately just depending on your perspective
sw4270B-ms98-a-0004 18.036500 24.023750 i had already changed juris[diction]- jurisdictions uh and so i had to reply that i couldn't do it
sw4270B-ms98-a-0005 24.023750 38.626875 [silence]
sw4270B-ms98-a-0006 38.626875 41.502250 w[ell]- was it civil or or criminal
sw4270B-ms98-a-0007 41.502250 69.382250 [silence]
sw4270B-ms98-a-0008 69.382250 78.508750 yeah well o[n]- on the one hand there's a lot of uh o[f]- of of positive things you're not at the whim of one person who might have a grudge or a preju[dice]-
sw4270B-ms98-a-0009 78.508750 80.987125 on the other hand um 
sw4270B-ms98-a-0010 80.987125 82.316125 well
sw4270B-ms98-a-0011 82.316125 89.293500 juries are not legally experti[se]- experts and and they often just feel bad for somebody
sw4270B-ms98-a-0012 89.293500 95.378625 but which is right they should often uh especially for example in a a civil case
sw4270B-ms98-a-0013 95.378625 108.748000 they'll feel bad for the person who got injured and not take into account uh any of the legal aspects of the incident and award large damages that were really undeserving from a legal point of view
sw4270B-ms98-a-0014 108.748000 158.916000 [silence]
sw4270B-ms98-a-0015 158.916000 160.129375 right
sw4270B-ms98-a-0016 160.129375 191.148375 [silence]
sw4270B-ms98-a-0017 191.148375 195.206000 yeah well it's hard you get when you get involved emotionally in somethings
sw4270B-ms98-a-0018 195.206000 198.148750 so i[t]- it uh it ge[ts]-
sw4270B-ms98-a-0019 198.148750 201.030625 [silence]
sw4270B-ms98-a-0020 201.030625 203.615750 uh all the civic duty yeah
sw4270B-ms98-a-0021 203.615750 205.244625 [silence]
sw4270B-ms98-a-0022 205.244625 213.444875 well i think one of the problems that we have here in the United States and the the question didn't seem to focus on civil things they wa[nt]- more focus on criminals
sw4270B-ms98-a-0023 213.444875 218.445250 but um from my my perspective one of the problems is that in our Bill of Rights
sw4270B-ms98-a-0024 218.445250 228.920500 we have it written that uh even for civil cases everyone's guaranteed a right to a jury as long as the uh dispute is for more than twenty five dollars
sw4270B-ms98-a-0025 228.920500 235.356125 now twenty five dollars at the time that they wrote the Bill of Rights was a lot different than what it is now
sw4270B-ms98-a-0026 235.356125 237.189250 and uh 
sw4270B-ms98-a-0027 237.189250 247.628500 basically what it means is uh they try to say you know like uh petty things you don't get a jury and nowadays that same twenty five dollars might be i don't know 
sw4270B-ms98-a-0028 247.628500 248.873875 [silence]
sw4270B-ms98-a-0029 248.873875 253.970875 ten thousand dollars i- i'm not exactly sure the uh the economics involved a[nd]- 
sw4270B-ms98-a-0030 253.970875 257.327500 that's right and uh it makes it very uh
sw4270B-ms98-a-0031 257.327500 258.328750 [silence]
sw4270B-ms98-a-0032 258.328750 266.053875 oh most cases i[n]- s[mall]- most small cases for uh civil suits really shouldn't h[ave]- even have the option of a jury
sw4270B-ms98-a-0033 266.053875 272.416875 uh i know we i was involved uh in a suit uh where the uh
sw4270B-ms98-a-0034 272.416875 273.450750 [silence]
sw4270B-ms98-a-0035 273.450750 280.674250 you know long time ago there was an accident whatever and an ambulance chaser came by and and wanted kn[ow]- you know i don't know five or ten thousand dollars
sw4270B-ms98-a-0036 280.674250 281.694500 [silence]
sw4270B-ms98-a-0037 281.694500 283.783250 and they requested a trial by jury
sw4270B-ms98-a-0038 283.783250 294.092375 and it seemed like really stupid that that they should even have that option for for such a small amount that our founding fathers didn't understand the economic principles involved
sw4270B-ms98-a-0039 294.092375 298.946000 [silence]
