sw4271A-ms98-a-0006 12.269750 25.082000 yeah in my case um i i turns out that i have a pretty good job right now but i grew up in a family that was fairly poor my dad was a college teacher and a high school teacher and we weren't really destitute but
sw4271A-ms98-a-0007 25.082000 30.318125 we never really had a lot of money so i never really got in the habit of spending a lot of money
sw4271A-ms98-a-0008 30.318125 31.774625 and so now
sw4271A-ms98-a-0009 31.774625 37.864250 i just it turns out that i spend less than i make so i never really bother to keep a budget
sw4271A-ms98-a-0010 37.864250 49.834250 [silence]
sw4271A-ms98-a-0011 49.834250 51.059500 uh-huh

sw4271A-ms98-a-0014 74.460375 85.830875 [silence]
sw4271A-ms98-a-0015 85.830875 87.947625 oh so you do keep track of it
sw4271A-ms98-a-0016 87.947625 97.552500 [silence]
sw4271A-ms98-a-0017 97.552500 100.277625 do you actually balance it at the end of the month
sw4271A-ms98-a-0018 100.277625 101.928500 oh 
sw4271A-ms98-a-0019 101.928500 110.707125 [silence]
sw4271A-ms98-a-0020 110.707125 117.464250 well i just started balancing my checkbook for the first time in my life since i've had a check[book]- and i'm i'm thirty two now so
sw4271A-ms98-a-0021 117.464250 125.904875 for i guess fourteen or fifteen years i've had a checking account but i've never actually bothered to balance it i just always made sure there was enough of money in there 
sw4271A-ms98-a-0022 125.904875 129.686875 if i wrote out a five hundred dollar check i'd transfer five hundred dollars in
sw4271A-ms98-a-0023 129.686875 135.653875 and i never actually checked to see if my balance matched the bank's and the other day i was well a couple months ago i started thinking
sw4271A-ms98-a-0024 135.653875 138.578875 you know i should really do that [laughter] 
sw4271A-ms98-a-0025 138.578875 142.018750 and i had just learned learned how to use Lotus on a PC
sw4271A-ms98-a-0026 142.018750 148.680875 and uh with Lotus it was pretty easy to set up a a little checking program so i could so it'd keep the balance for me
sw4271A-ms98-a-0027 148.680875 153.395625 [silence]
sw4271A-ms98-a-0028 153.395625 154.643875 uh-huh

sw4271A-ms98-a-0031 163.392375 166.065250 yeah my i still haven't balanced
sw4271A-ms98-a-0032 166.065250 172.996625 i figure if i keep do[ing]- keep this up long enough eventually someday it'll balance and then at that point then i can try to keep it balanced
sw4271A-ms98-a-0033 172.996625 205.652500 [silence]
