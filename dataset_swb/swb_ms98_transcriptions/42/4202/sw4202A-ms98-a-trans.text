sw4202A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 4.420750 [noise] -[w]ell Doug what are they doing in your community in Pennsylvania about recycling
sw4202A-ms98-a-0002 4.420750 9.291000 [silence]
sw4202A-ms98-a-0003 9.291000 10.954750 uh-huh
sw4202A-ms98-a-0004 10.954750 28.944375 [silence]
sw4202A-ms98-a-0005 28.944375 30.475125 uh-huh
sw4202A-ms98-a-0006 30.475125 34.347500 so the the people have to separate it out is that
sw4202A-ms98-a-0007 34.347500 45.031750 [silence]
sw4202A-ms98-a-0008 45.031750 46.733125 oh
sw4202A-ms98-a-0009 46.733125 52.943375 [silence]
sw4202A-ms98-a-0010 52.943375 54.534125 yeah
sw4202A-ms98-a-0011 54.534125 60.446250 how about_1 at Penn State do they recycle things like uh computer paper and that sort of thing
sw4202A-ms98-a-0012 60.446250 79.872500 [silence]
sw4202A-ms98-a-0013 79.872500 82.091125 oh yeah
sw4202A-ms98-a-0014 82.091125 86.691000 [silence]
sw4202A-ms98-a-0015 86.691000 87.515625 oh
sw4202A-ms98-a-0016 87.515625 92.883375 [silence]
sw4202A-ms98-a-0017 92.883375 99.997625 well what i've uh learned about recycling is that it's almost impractical to recycle newspapers
sw4202A-ms98-a-0018 99.997625 101.560625 which is sad
sw4202A-ms98-a-0019 101.560625 112.746625 and and as a matter of fact i'm member of a civic organization where we had someone from the city of Dallas come talk to us about recycling and the whole key to recycling is demand
sw4202A-ms98-a-0020 112.746625 115.940000 the supply is there people are willing to do it
sw4202A-ms98-a-0021 115.940000 124.547875 but for example until they figure out how they can strip the inks off of [vocalized-noise] used newspapers effective[ly]- cost effectively
sw4202A-ms98-a-0022 124.547875 126.674000 then it's not gonna happen
sw4202A-ms98-a-0023 126.674000 133.662375 and and there are whole huge warehouses in Dallas full of used newspapers
sw4202A-ms98-a-0024 133.662375 140.534875 and i think they actually are building some sort of a plant in Texas where they can strip the ink off
sw4202A-ms98-a-0025 140.534875 147.417375 i know at work we recycle white paper and cans like you said
sw4202A-ms98-a-0026 147.417375 154.851500 uh the city of Plano is actually doing quite a bit they recently started picking up um
sw4202A-ms98-a-0027 154.851500 160.059250 glass aluminum and and they will take newspapers too
sw4202A-ms98-a-0028 160.059250 169.311625 and it apparently doesn't have to be sorted they haven't quite reached my neighborhood [laughter-yet] but they're doing all sorts of smart things uh
sw4202A-ms98-a-0029 169.311625 175.733250 they no longer allow grass clippings to be bagged up in plastic bags and put out by the trash
sw4202A-ms98-a-0030 175.733250 177.463875 [silence]
sw4202A-ms98-a-0031 177.463875 187.077375 yes if you want to bag you know if you if if you don't want the clippings left on your lawn you can bag them in biodegradable bags which means paper
sw4202A-ms98-a-0032 187.077375 189.468875 which you can buy from the city
sw4202A-ms98-a-0033 189.468875 194.054625 and and they're great until it rains and then they start [laughter-biodegrading]
sw4202A-ms98-a-0034 194.054625 195.472125 [silence]
sw4202A-ms98-a-0035 195.472125 201.376750 but they are uh contracting with someone to turn all these clippings into mulch
sw4202A-ms98-a-0036 201.376750 214.624875 and i don't know whether i don't know whether it'll be available to the to the citizens of the town or whether it will just be used in the parks and recreation department or something i i don't know i guess it really doesn't matter [laughter]
sw4202A-ms98-a-0037 214.624875 215.929875 [laughter]
sw4202A-ms98-a-0038 215.929875 216.887375 but
sw4202A-ms98-a-0039 216.887375 218.835125 it's uh
sw4202A-ms98-a-0040 218.835125 230.576750 uh since they won't take any yard waste it's that's in plastic bags it's a little bit annoying when you're you know pulling up your vegetable garden at the end of the season and that sort of thing
sw4202A-ms98-a-0041 230.576750 241.768750 and you don't have any of the their special paper bags on hand because you haven't bagged your clippings at all you just let them recycle themselves [laughter]
sw4202A-ms98-a-0042 241.768750 243.136625 [laughter]
sw4202A-ms98-a-0043 243.136625 251.128500 but uh i don't know i th[is]- for a rather small town well hundred thousand people or so i guess this pretty progressive community 
sw4202A-ms98-a-0044 251.128500 256.993375 [silence]
sw4202A-ms98-a-0045 256.993375 259.363000 um [vocalized-noise]
sw4202A-ms98-a-0046 259.363000 272.146625 i don't know about statewide i think i think in the Dallas area there are few other uh suburbs Plano's a suburb that uh are doing things about recycling
sw4202A-ms98-a-0047 272.146625 284.193250 but it in order for it to be cost effective you have to have customers for it you have to have people say i won't have i won't buy paper unless it's recycled
sw4202A-ms98-a-0048 284.193250 287.040375 [silence]
sw4202A-ms98-a-0049 287.040375 288.708500 i mean
sw4202A-ms98-a-0050 288.708500 299.522000 [silence]
