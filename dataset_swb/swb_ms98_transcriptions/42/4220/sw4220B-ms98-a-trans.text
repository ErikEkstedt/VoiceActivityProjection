sw4220B-ms98-a-0021 98.481875 105.935375 granted if your s[kill]- your skills were like nuclear physics so you pretty much narrow t[o]- to uh

sw4220B-ms98-a-0023 106.664625 108.629500 your choices are narrowed but
sw4220B-ms98-a-0024 108.629500 115.812625 i can see someone with on doing what i do going into many different sort of venue i guess you'd call them in a larger company

sw4220B-ms98-a-0028 123.162750 128.868250 so for our end users and our customer i'm you know uh 
sw4220B-ms98-a-0029 128.868250 133.328875 i'm pretty much limited to that that's what that's what i do

sw4220B-ms98-a-0033 155.999750 165.417375 yeah i think one of the disadvantages is the bureaucracy that props up as a you know necessity for almost any[thing]- getting anything done at all you have to
sw4220B-ms98-a-0034 165.417375 166.739125 uh

sw4220B-ms98-a-0046 226.955875 228.666625 uh structure
sw4220B-ms98-a-0047 228.666625 231.920875 we are many different work groups however we work together 
sw4220B-ms98-a-0048 231.920875 236.851000 um that's by design we've had the same structure for basically for twenty years
sw4220B-ms98-a-0049 236.851000 242.154500 and uh it allows us to do many interesting thing we have many facet to our organization
sw4220B-ms98-a-0050 242.154500 254.740875 uh and we are able to mix and match and bring different facets into play as they're needed so we we basically cover the whole spectrum of computing uh for our for our customers and uh
