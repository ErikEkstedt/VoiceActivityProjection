sw4295A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 5.021500 [noise] i've got some pretty firm feelings on this one and that is that we are definitely not getting our money's worth
sw4295A-ms98-a-0002 5.021500 20.597500 um primarily uh i think the one big thing that stands out among all this is uh the amount of money that our taxes go to to pay for interest on the federal deficit which is just an absolute inexcusable waste
sw4295A-ms98-a-0003 20.597500 21.268250 [silence]
sw4295A-ms98-a-0004 21.268250 26.600125 it's terrible you know it's huge i have no idea what the actual number really is but it

sw4295A-ms98-a-0006 32.874625 43.462750 yeah i think that the people that um orchestrated this and engineered our having the deficit should have appreciated you know what it was ultimately going to cost it was a very bad decision to start letting that grow

sw4295A-ms98-a-0020 132.378125 141.709000 well as much as that's a bad thing i think that uh there's some other really major major things that need straightened out and you'd mentioned waste a little while ago
sw4295A-ms98-a-0021 141.709000 153.041000 and uh i've seen with my own eyes a tremendous amount of government waste i was in the marine corps and we had uh several hundred thousand dollars worth of transformers sitting on the wall that had been contracted out
sw4295A-ms98-a-0022 153.041000 160.163500 to be built as replacement parts for an old Westinghouse Radar Westinghouse wasn't going to support it anymore and Spencer you know Spencer Gifts
sw4295A-ms98-a-0023 160.163500 174.192750 that company said they'd go ahead and build these things and they didn't build them to specifications so they were unusable they were too physically large to go back in and we spent um four thousand dollars apiece on those things and there they just sat there taking up valuable space in
sw4295A-ms98-a-0024 174.192750 177.577750 front of everybody and they were there the whole time i was down there
