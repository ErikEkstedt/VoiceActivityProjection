sw4295B-ms98-a-0002 0.908375 15.596875 [silence]
sw4295B-ms98-a-0003 15.596875 16.902250 um-hum
sw4295B-ms98-a-0004 16.902250 19.342125 [silence]
sw4295B-ms98-a-0005 19.342125 22.863500 it's about uh twenty percent of the federal budget isn't it at this moment
sw4295B-ms98-a-0006 22.863500 25.261875 [silence]
sw4295B-ms98-a-0007 25.261875 30.509625 but you can't unfortunately you can't do anything about that except get rid of the budget deficit and
sw4295B-ms98-a-0008 30.509625 35.088125 not at this point in the business cycle you can't
sw4295B-ms98-a-0009 35.088125 40.717125 [silence]
sw4295B-ms98-a-0010 40.717125 41.969500 yeah
sw4295B-ms98-a-0011 41.969500 55.891875 yeah i would agree with that it was we were actually in twenty years ago we were not in bad shape we had we had been in pretty bad shape after World War Two and then we paid off some of the debt of or at least we inflated it away which is probably more what happened and uh
sw4295B-ms98-a-0012 55.891875 69.730750 then at the end of the Johnson Administration the budget Nixon's first year that was that was uh set up by Johnson was balanced and that was the last balanced budget we've got well of course part of the problem is that that um
sw4295B-ms98-a-0013 69.730750 74.475875 the federal government just grows and it seems like that the only way to restrain it
sw4295B-ms98-a-0014 74.475875 84.532375 is to restrain the increase in taxes if taxes are increased uh the government finds a way to spend it even you know given even that despite the fact that we have a budget deficit
sw4295B-ms98-a-0015 84.532375 96.272250 i think what we really need to do is concentrate more on reducing waste on assuring that government be efficient you know we need more programs where people get rewarded for money saving suggestions w[e]-
sw4295B-ms98-a-0016 96.272250 97.523625 [noise]
sw4295B-ms98-a-0017 97.523625 107.040625 we need more programs to well i mean for example a tax reform law okay a so called tax reform of nineteen eighty six began as a tax simplification law
sw4295B-ms98-a-0018 107.040625 119.130875 which would've made it easier to enforce and would've saved us i mean another way that they in effect increase your taxes is by increasing the amount that you have to pay to get them prepared or the amount of time you need to take to get your records in order
sw4295B-ms98-a-0019 119.130875 131.952125 and the eighty six tax reform well just made it more complicated even though it started as a simplification bill if i were Ronald Reagan i would've said unless that reduces the size of the IRS code by thirty percent i'm going to veto it
sw4295B-ms98-a-0020 131.952125 140.696000 [silence]
sw4295B-ms98-a-0021 140.696000 142.065000 um-hum
sw4295B-ms98-a-0022 142.065000 160.716125 [silence]
sw4295B-ms98-a-0023 160.716125 161.650250 [noise]
sw4295B-ms98-a-0024 161.650250 176.131250 [silence]
sw4295B-ms98-a-0025 176.131250 183.161625 another thing that that that that that reminds me of is um I was talking to people who work at AT&T Gilford Center 
sw4295B-ms98-a-0026 183.161625 197.585875 and they have a government contract to do work on some computer for the Navy i'm not sure what it's called [vocalized-noise] called but it's some uh military standard architecture with a with a sixteen bit address space i mean they're still working with a sixteen bit address space 
sw4295B-ms98-a-0027 197.585875 206.099375 and they're writing all their software to overlay programs into this sixteen bit address space rather than going to something that was you know modern fifteen years ago
sw4295B-ms98-a-0028 206.099375 216.258500 i don't know how much it costs them to maintain that outdated software but you'd think at some stage they'd get the get the idea that it it it pays to get to be more current
sw4295B-ms98-a-0029 216.258500 224.001500 [silence]
sw4295B-ms98-a-0030 224.001500 230.249250 well the Republican solution is to cut taxes
sw4295B-ms98-a-0031 230.249250 244.576750 and i uh that may prevent it from getting worse but it doesn't solve it we haven't gotten our budget back into any better balance if it had not been for the savings and loan debacle at least it would have remained the same as a result it's gotten worse but uh
sw4295B-ms98-a-0032 244.576750 250.703000 [silence]
sw4295B-ms98-a-0033 250.703000 252.267875 that's right that's right
sw4295B-ms98-a-0034 252.267875 264.020750 um so i- i- i don't know i mean th[ere]- th[ere]- there's only three things you can do you you can you can cut programs you can raise taxes or you can cut waste and at the moment people don't want programs cut although
sw4295B-ms98-a-0035 264.020750 279.018500 uh i'm not sure that some of them shouldn't be looked at more carefully pro[grams]- uh uh and i think of of programs you know when you when uh uh like the the um aid to families with dependent children that appears to create an incentive for unmarried women to have more kids
sw4295B-ms98-a-0036 279.018500 286.277250 uh i'm a little concerned about that i'm a little concerned [laughter-about] cutting it out too because they might just end up aborting all of them
sw4295B-ms98-a-0037 286.277250 298.946000 but uh there's th[ere]- th[ere]- you know Governor Thompson of Wisconsin has an idea which is pay the fathers of these children to marry the mothers and at least that way you get you get the mother you know the fathers to take up some of the some of
