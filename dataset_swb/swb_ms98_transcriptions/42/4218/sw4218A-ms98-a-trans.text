sw4218A-ms98-a-0003 2.583875 21.756125 [silence]
sw4218A-ms98-a-0004 21.756125 25.882750 uh different types of plastic other than food types container plastic
sw4218A-ms98-a-0005 25.882750 27.824625 um what about glass

sw4218A-ms98-a-0009 36.389250 42.328125 yeah okay that's that's the way we do it here uh we have the addition thing of uh newspaper pickup
sw4218A-ms98-a-0010 42.328125 52.891500 but it doesn't include uh magazines or telephone books or just plain regular paper like computer print out just only for news print only
sw4218A-ms98-a-0011 52.891500 53.898500 [silence]
sw4218A-ms98-a-0012 53.898500 57.416375 that's not included that's that's completely different
sw4218A-ms98-a-0013 57.416375 58.473500 uh
sw4218A-ms98-a-0014 58.473500 70.966000 i feel you know it's kind of ridiculous you know you're only allowed to pick-up one sort of paper when you have something such as phone books which contributes a lot to uh waste paper they should pick that up as well
sw4218A-ms98-a-0015 70.966000 74.711500 [silence]
sw4218A-ms98-a-0016 74.711500 87.973500 yes that that would be good if they can if they would pick it up i- i- i put them in too because [vocalized-noise] so much of the uh junk mail that you get is made of the same type of uh print uh wax print
sw4218A-ms98-a-0017 87.973500 90.314750 that's makes it hard to recycle

sw4218A-ms98-a-0033 140.506750 147.700875 hum well wh[at]- what we have you just instituted here was a um uh biodegradable type pick-up
sw4218A-ms98-a-0034 147.700875 156.159625 uh once a week they'll come by and out of a container that you've mark only for biodegradable plant clippings lawn clippings
sw4218A-ms98-a-0035 156.159625 163.212750 uh it has to be decomposable matter no uh dirt uh no bricks or anything like that
sw4218A-ms98-a-0036 163.212750 168.136875 uh they'll pick that up once a week and we are not allowed to put that in normal trash
sw4218A-ms98-a-0037 168.136875 171.668000 [silence]
