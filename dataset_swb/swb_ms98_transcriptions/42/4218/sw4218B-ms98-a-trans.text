sw4218B-ms98-a-0003 2.390125 5.117125 well in our area we uh
sw4218B-ms98-a-0004 5.117125 9.991625 had basically a road side pick-up for uh aluminum cans plastic
sw4218B-ms98-a-0005 9.991625 15.848625 um that's about it if you want to participate with paper um
sw4218B-ms98-a-0006 15.848625 21.830125 wood and other products alone that line uh different types of plastic you have to bring physically down to the dump
sw4218B-ms98-a-0007 21.830125 24.448875 [silence]
sw4218B-ms98-a-0008 24.448875 25.794000 right
sw4218B-ms98-a-0009 25.794000 27.549875 [silence]
sw4218B-ms98-a-0010 27.549875 31.192750 um glass actually that's handle on the road side too
sw4218B-ms98-a-0011 31.192750 32.914875 [silence]
sw4218B-ms98-a-0012 32.914875 36.830375 along with no glass and the aluminum together
sw4218B-ms98-a-0013 36.830375 52.502250 [silence]
sw4218B-ms98-a-0014 52.502250 54.180750 what about cardboard
sw4218B-ms98-a-0015 54.180750 71.049500 [silence]
sw4218B-ms98-a-0016 71.049500 75.343500 [noise] what do you think about the value of of magazines as you mentioned
sw4218B-ms98-a-0017 75.343500 90.294375 uh
sw4218B-ms98-a-0018 90.294375 92.853250 well in our town we've imposed um
sw4218B-ms98-a-0019 92.853250 93.868250 [silence]
sw4218B-ms98-a-0020 93.868250 100.584125 [vocalized-noise] basically a [vocalized-noise] sign that forces people to recycle you have to pay for all your trash all your trash bags
sw4218B-ms98-a-0021 100.584125 102.802875 there's no more municipal trash pick-up
sw4218B-ms98-a-0022 102.802875 108.217500 and that intricate people encourages them to uh reduce there waste
sw4218B-ms98-a-0023 108.217500 111.747625 um and that actually had a pretty good result so for
sw4218B-ms98-a-0024 111.747625 116.117250 [silence]
sw4218B-ms98-a-0025 116.117250 123.559875 no there um [vocalized-noise] a lot of them_1 are recycling by trying to compress their trash into the bags as much as they can
sw4218B-ms98-a-0026 123.559875 127.666375 um but for the most part it it's been a big boost to the recycling effort
sw4218B-ms98-a-0027 127.666375 133.279000 it was uh much contested because no one likes to have to pay a dollar fifty a bag 
sw4218B-ms98-a-0028 133.279000 134.823250 [silence]
sw4218B-ms98-a-0029 134.823250 139.321500 it it is very steep but it really forces you to think about what you're throwing out
sw4218B-ms98-a-0030 139.321500 165.199750 [silence]
sw4218B-ms98-a-0031 165.199750 166.355375 hum
sw4218B-ms98-a-0032 166.355375 168.788125 [silence]
sw4218B-ms98-a-0033 168.788125 172.435500 well that makes good sense what did he do turn into compose or
sw4218B-ms98-a-0034 172.435500 183.787375 [silence]
sw4218B-ms98-a-0035 183.787375 188.308875 hum yeah we don't have anything like that around here or at least that i am aware of
sw4218B-ms98-a-0036 188.308875 196.113000 but that does sound like it could be beneficial especially in the fall when you've got about twenty bags of leaves out on the side of the road
sw4218B-ms98-a-0037 196.113000 202.785750 [silence]
sw4218B-ms98-a-0038 202.785750 212.596750 um in our area a[s]- a[s]- as i mention earlier if you force people to pay for their trash they're going think twice about what they're throwing out
sw4218B-ms98-a-0039 212.596750 218.100000 they're going to look at everything closely i know i go out of my way to recycle what ever i can
sw4218B-ms98-a-0040 218.100000 221.484125 um part of it is because [vocalized-noise] my environmental
sw4218B-ms98-a-0041 221.484125 224.813875 belief but [vocalized-noise] the main part is uh
sw4218B-ms98-a-0042 224.813875 228.466000 you know avoid paying more than they have to pay
sw4218B-ms98-a-0043 228.466000 236.261375 and uh i think if more people are force to make that type of decision you know as far as the pocket book they're going to recycle
sw4218B-ms98-a-0044 236.261375 245.209125 [silence]
sw4218B-ms98-a-0045 245.209125 247.197625 no i think that
sw4218B-ms98-a-0046 247.197625 249.054000 people uh
sw4218B-ms98-a-0047 249.054000 250.131125 [silence]
sw4218B-ms98-a-0048 250.131125 257.025875 that that that hurts people economically and i don't think that really benefits the overall recycling effort
sw4218B-ms98-a-0049 257.025875 264.379875 um because_1 i know a lot of people just throw out there cans anyway regards weather it's a nickle a dime for a bottle
sw4218B-ms98-a-0050 264.379875 265.382625 [silence]
sw4218B-ms98-a-0051 265.382625 270.128125 um and i'm just not a big believer in that type of text which is how i view it
sw4218B-ms98-a-0052 270.128125 282.009250 [silence]
sw4218B-ms98-a-0053 282.009250 288.327750 what i think you run into a problem there is then you have to bring the cans down to a dep[artment]- a a pick-up center
sw4218B-ms98-a-0054 288.327750 299.170000 [silence]
