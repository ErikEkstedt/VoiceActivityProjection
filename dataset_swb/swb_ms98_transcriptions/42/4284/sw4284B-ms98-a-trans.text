sw4284B-ms98-a-0002 0.616250 11.867125 no uh i'm single and but i've i been keeping an eye on what the child care situation is and i have several friends that do have children
sw4284B-ms98-a-0003 11.867125 17.012375 [silence]
sw4284B-ms98-a-0004 17.012375 20.079125 well it's it's uh it's
sw4284B-ms98-a-0005 20.079125 33.083000 i- i feel that uh regulation uh whether be at the state or federal level is a must so we can have some sort of standards from one place to another uh 
sw4284B-ms98-a-0006 33.083000 44.197875 that uh in terms of cleanliness uh the ratio between the uh adults to children is maintained uh
sw4284B-ms98-a-0007 44.197875 47.211750 food and so on
sw4284B-ms98-a-0008 47.211750 55.165125 i don't think one pers[on]- one adult should have like twenty children to keep after
sw4284B-ms98-a-0009 55.165125 63.184250 [silence]
sw4284B-ms98-a-0010 63.184250 75.648625 well the facility i i don't have a problem with it's just how many adults or how many children to an adult and i[f]- if i remember correctly um
sw4284B-ms98-a-0011 75.648625 79.055625 one adult for six children was very good
sw4284B-ms98-a-0012 79.055625 87.813625 for around here and was more twelve to twelve children one to one adult was about the average
sw4284B-ms98-a-0013 87.813625 95.267125 [silence]
sw4284B-ms98-a-0014 95.267125 102.442250 and so on but the but in day care usually the child is not able to um
sw4284B-ms98-a-0015 102.442250 107.562875 function totally on his own whether if i[t's]- if it's uh a toddler
sw4284B-ms98-a-0016 107.562875 112.432000 uh diapers have to be changed uh must be tended to constantly
sw4284B-ms98-a-0017 112.432000 115.446125 for fear that they might get into something
sw4284B-ms98-a-0018 115.446125 122.979125 [silence]
sw4284B-ms98-a-0019 122.979125 133.939000 i think there is it's just that sometimes location makes it difficult if if if i was married there is no place between my house and work
sw4284B-ms98-a-0020 133.939000 138.944375 that is convenient that i could uh use as for child care
sw4284B-ms98-a-0021 138.944375 146.822750 they're usually in areas where they can they can afford to set up shop and not where it's convenient for the people that are working
sw4284B-ms98-a-0022 146.822750 151.138250 [silence]
sw4284B-ms98-a-0023 151.138250 163.923875 well some companies i've noticed will provide the facilities and then let a let a uh a company come in and provide the child care while the employer's just p[roviding]- providing the the facility
sw4284B-ms98-a-0024 163.923875 176.371375 and many cases like in large companies that becomes a perk to the employees where they're able to get reduced child care and in and in the case of uh new mothers they're able to go 
sw4284B-ms98-a-0025 176.371375 182.788125 uh instead of a cigarette break they can go see their child for ten minutes and then go back to work
sw4284B-ms98-a-0026 182.788125 196.679000 you have a better retention then of um people by not having them_1 go on sick leave or uh paid holiday to take care of their children and so it saves the company money it's in the company's best interest
sw4284B-ms98-a-0027 196.679000 210.281375 [silence]
sw4284B-ms98-a-0028 210.281375 214.477250 no it['s]- it's it's a relatively new idea from what i understand
sw4284B-ms98-a-0029 214.477250 229.201500 it's ha[s]- uh enough companies haven't gotten on the bandwagon they where they could see a realization and um savings of money right n[ow]- by people being at work and not taking off and being at home
sw4284B-ms98-a-0030 229.201500 233.802125 if you make it convenient for them_1 people will s[tay]- uh stay
sw4284B-ms98-a-0031 233.802125 238.661625 or stay with the company if you if there're more perks like that you can give them
sw4284B-ms98-a-0032 238.661625 243.628750 it's not just money it's it's everything about it and child care is a big issue
sw4284B-ms98-a-0033 243.628750 245.559625 [silence]
sw4284B-ms98-a-0034 245.559625 248.532125 it's important to me if i was married and had children
sw4284B-ms98-a-0035 248.532125 251.699750 i'd want to be as close to my kids as i possibly could
sw4284B-ms98-a-0036 251.699750 258.809250 [silence]
sw4284B-ms98-a-0037 258.809250 265.113750 i'm the same way but then again how do you provide for the child when you can't work
sw4284B-ms98-a-0038 265.113750 296.751375 [silence]
sw4284B-ms98-a-0039 296.751375 298.626000 um-hum
