sw4252B-ms98-a-0002 0.280500 1.473875 uh [vocalized-noise]
sw4252B-ms98-a-0003 1.473875 2.231000 [laughter]
sw4252B-ms98-a-0004 2.231000 12.490125 well let's see um generally i don't think there should be much gun control uh i like to i like to do a lot of hunting and i have my own gun at home and stuff but
sw4252B-ms98-a-0005 12.490125 16.998750 uh the older i get i think the more i [laughter-believe] [laughter-there] ought to be gun control
sw4252B-ms98-a-0006 16.998750 28.245750 for instance uh just yesterday i go out my front door and somebody had shot a dog out of their front door their subdivision and the thing kind of wound up right where my kids get picked up at the bus stop
sw4252B-ms98-a-0007 28.245750 29.746750 so uh
sw4252B-ms98-a-0008 29.746750 40.484375 yeah it is creepy you know and uh you know it makes me think hey you know there's a lot of a there's a lot of nutcases you know just living even in you know in your subdivision and i mean [laughter]
sw4252B-ms98-a-0009 40.484375 41.964500 [silence]
sw4252B-ms98-a-0010 41.964500 51.981000 yeah see yeah you look like look at automatic weapons and things like that and uh you know clearly they have no no useful hunting purpose and uh
sw4252B-ms98-a-0011 51.981000 65.493750 [laughter-yeah] even then [laughter-if] you're that bad it probably wouldn't help any anyway just [vocalized-noise] help you kill li[ke]- i mean up in Virginia a lot of hunters get killed anyway just with shotguns you know so i can't imagine what it'd be like if they're doing it with automatic weapons 
sw4252B-ms98-a-0012 65.493750 74.490500 uh when i hunt i use a twelve gauge shotgun it's uh actually a lot of heavy broacher so it's kind of a short range kind of thing
sw4252B-ms98-a-0013 74.490500 75.793625 [silence]
sw4252B-ms98-a-0014 75.793625 82.492125 uh well i the last time i hunted i hunted turkey actually and uh you know it's
sw4252B-ms98-a-0015 82.492125 89.722250 i wasn't too successful but [laughter] i would've shot one if i'd seen [laughter-one] [laughter] [laughter-so] and
sw4252B-ms98-a-0016 89.722250 92.495500 [silence]
sw4252B-ms98-a-0017 92.495500 99.485625 oh yeah well you're supposed to and yeah you're supposed to sure you have to try to get it out of there
sw4252B-ms98-a-0018 99.485625 100.707625 uh
sw4252B-ms98-a-0019 100.707625 102.788125 [silence]
sw4252B-ms98-a-0020 102.788125 108.979375 well it's actually uh i don't know if this is true anymore but it's lead shot saying that you don't want to
sw4252B-ms98-a-0021 108.979375 112.014625 you don't want eat a piece of lead but um
sw4252B-ms98-a-0022 112.014625 126.465250 yeah i think uh you're supposed to do that also you have to be real careful uh about what the animal's been eating you know like uh if you ever hunt pheasant you know sometimes they get into corn that's been uh like you know has mercury on it or something and
sw4252B-ms98-a-0023 126.465250 136.207750 and uh to keep the because_1 the corn gets treated to keep uh insect dusts away so so if you go in and you dig into the pheasant yeah you can get mercury pois[on]-
sw4252B-ms98-a-0024 136.207750 149.751875 but uh so there's i mean there's sort of some risks to that actually uh let me think [vocalized-noise] gun control uh i- i gen[erally]- generally actually [vocalized-noise] since i live so close to DC and since it's the murder capital of the world and you know th[e]-
sw4252B-ms98-a-0025 149.751875 158.226750 yeah well they have guy[s]- i mean i guess they have this Atlanta too but i mean they got guys you know running around you know driving down the street with sub machine guns and stuff and
sw4252B-ms98-a-0026 158.226750 170.753875 you know i don't even let my wife and uh kids go down there anymore unless you know i'm with them or something and then we just stick strictly to the mall area you know we never never venture outside of that area so
sw4252B-ms98-a-0027 170.753875 185.247500 [silence]
sw4252B-ms98-a-0028 185.247500 186.472750 yeah

sw4252B-ms98-a-0030 189.490750 201.024250 doesn't that kind of strike you as [vocalized-noise] especially in big cities that uh you know the law enforcement agencies aren't really capable of of providing the kind of protection that you they should be able to provide
sw4252B-ms98-a-0031 201.024250 206.482500 [silence]

sw4252B-ms98-a-0037 213.335250 215.819750 coming at [vocalized-noise] or something you know
sw4252B-ms98-a-0038 215.819750 218.483875 [silence]
sw4252B-ms98-a-0039 218.483875 219.989750 yeah

sw4252B-ms98-a-0043 226.496375 228.458250 yeah i
sw4252B-ms98-a-0044 228.458250 240.485250 you know i feel like like you know the when they when they interview these criminals you know the burglars and things they that the two things that they say keep them out of a house best are guns and dogs because_1 they
sw4252B-ms98-a-0045 240.485250 246.378625 yeah so they know there's a dog there they know there's a gun there you know they're probably not going to rob you they'll probably go to the next house
sw4252B-ms98-a-0046 246.378625 259.265375 and uh if they if they suddenly pass a really global law that says you can't have any guns you know there i mean there's guaranteed to be a higher percentage of people just breaking in assuming that these guys don't have any guns and [vocalized-noise]

sw4252B-ms98-a-0054 276.983625 285.985250 yeah contributing maybe contributing factors too n[obody]- nobody knows about yeah i'm [vocalized-noise] i'm usually pretty skeptical on that kind of stuff these studies
sw4252B-ms98-a-0055 285.985250 289.496875 [silence]
sw4252B-ms98-a-0056 289.496875 299.074000 yeah clearly they have some other motive you know i mean the[ir]- their argument used to be you know the communist were going to take over or something well they aren't anymore you know so what's the argument now well
