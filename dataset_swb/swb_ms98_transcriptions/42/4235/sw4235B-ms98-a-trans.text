sw4235B-ms98-a-0005 24.352500 34.849125 uh to tell you the truth i get most of my s[tuff]- uh news from printed media um news magazines like Time uh newspapers 
sw4235B-ms98-a-0006 34.849125 40.870000 i'll watch television at in the evening for local news but uh
sw4235B-ms98-a-0007 40.870000 55.798250 you know for national things i i tend to go more for printed m[edia]- uh media because they they don't give you the th[ree]- sound bytes the three seconds uh gee he looks good in a in a camera you know uh although i have to admit i'm dissatisfied with the 
sw4235B-ms98-a-0008 55.798250 61.452875 quality that you get in the newspapers it's unfortunate but 
sw4235B-ms98-a-0009 61.452875 62.413250 that's been
sw4235B-ms98-a-0010 62.413250 69.204375 w[ell]- uh well let's see uh no no actually we're LA Times we also get the New York Times out here um
sw4235B-ms98-a-0011 69.204375 80.143250 and then of course there are lots of specialized publications for you know i work in engineering so you get engineering uh stuff uh what i found is that uh
sw4235B-ms98-a-0012 80.143250 92.809000 uh you know you are subjected to censorship uh even though that's a bad word uh what happens is an editor has to decide what will fit in the newspaper and what gets dropped on the floor and that's censorship
sw4235B-ms98-a-0013 92.809000 99.520625 [silence]
sw4235B-ms98-a-0014 99.520625 100.625000 that's right
sw4235B-ms98-a-0015 100.625000 110.604500 [silence]
sw4235B-ms98-a-0016 110.604500 112.326875 i uh
sw4235B-ms98-a-0017 112.326875 124.522000 i i agree with that i've seen that in several uh computer magazines where you know if the guy buys six pages of of color ads then he gets a pretty good review in when they review products
sw4235B-ms98-a-0018 124.522000 128.568875 [silence]
sw4235B-ms98-a-0019 128.568875 134.731875 uh [laughter] gets a favorable light cast on it [laughter]
sw4235B-ms98-a-0020 134.731875 144.310625 [silence]
sw4235B-ms98-a-0021 144.310625 150.994500 well you know there's a big problem with the the local news is something we've noticed i mean out here in LA we get gang shootings you know
sw4235B-ms98-a-0022 150.994500 162.044750 and so what you can do is you turn on the local news and if it's a bad weekend the first fifteen minutes on a on a Sunday night or a Monday night will be how many people got shot and killed
sw4235B-ms98-a-0023 162.044750 168.893875 [silence]
sw4235B-ms98-a-0024 168.893875 169.909625 right

sw4235B-ms98-a-0026 172.640000 173.678750 right
sw4235B-ms98-a-0027 173.678750 175.978875 [silence]
sw4235B-ms98-a-0028 175.978875 179.956000 a lot o[f]- a lot of times though there there isn't the really nice stuff 
sw4235B-ms98-a-0029 179.956000 192.291375 oh yeah the uh in i[n]- at least the the news stations that we watch here in LA and i mean you know it's it's uh uh maybe it's just because they're stuck with [laughter] more bad news than good news 
sw4235B-ms98-a-0030 192.291375 205.234375 uh but uh you know it's it's it's unfortunate but even even now i mean i used to live in Europe and we still get uh we lived in Germany and so we still get some German language magazines some 
sw4235B-ms98-a-0031 205.234375 206.423875 [silence] 
sw4235B-ms98-a-0032 206.423875 208.993375 okay we get [vocalized-noise]
sw4235B-ms98-a-0033 208.993375 213.405625 and uh the thing is that you know that of course is slanted 
sw4235B-ms98-a-0034 213.405625 223.036625 from a German point of view and uh you know what you notice are the glaring differences between how America perceives
sw4235B-ms98-a-0035 223.036625 229.942625 some monumentous event in the world versus how the Germans perceive that same event
sw4235B-ms98-a-0036 229.942625 244.817125 and i mean it's uh you know the the difficulty is that okay they're it's a business over there like it is here they're slanting it toward their uh public and we're slanting it toward our public and you know the question is what's the real truth
sw4235B-ms98-a-0037 244.817125 256.321250 [silence]
sw4235B-ms98-a-0038 256.321250 257.283750 yeah

sw4235B-ms98-a-0042 263.907500 267.188875 well it's also again um you know the
sw4235B-ms98-a-0043 267.188875 277.950375 the uh the the people who write the history it's their view and from wherever they happen to be i mean what we've noticed is that um
sw4235B-ms98-a-0044 277.950375 289.144125 uh the the way the uh the Americans are handling Russia the Germans view that as a critical new market and the Americans are well you know the [vocalized-noise] 
sw4235B-ms98-a-0045 289.144125 298.562000 w[ell]- yeah yeah and the uh the thing is that the Americans are well we don't really don't want to get involved with that we don't want to help them they've got to learn to help themselves you know free market econ[omy]-
