sw4235A-ms98-a-0002 6.647250 13.630375 so i'm not sure how remarkably well informed i am by their like three second sound bytes about everything

sw4235A-ms98-a-0012 61.374375 64.581750 which newspapers in particular like USA Today
sw4235A-ms98-a-0013 64.581750 66.366375 [silence]
sw4235A-ms98-a-0014 66.366375 67.226875 oh

sw4235A-ms98-a-0021 92.257750 100.071375 well that i think that comes about from the fact that that th[e]- the news gathering business is is just that a business 
sw4235A-ms98-a-0022 100.071375 113.053500 so they're going to tell you what sells and also although i don't believe this is really that rampant a[t]- now uh you know sponsors or or advertisers could have some influence as well over over what uh eventually gets printed 
sw4235A-ms98-a-0023 113.053500 116.263500 [silence]
sw4235A-ms98-a-0024 116.263500 117.610000 yeah

sw4235A-ms98-a-0026 123.658750 131.444875 and also i think you'll also notice if you ever do watch CNN Headline News that anytime Ted Turner does anything [laughter] he shows up on there
sw4235A-ms98-a-0027 131.444875 132.849625 [silence]
sw4235A-ms98-a-0028 132.849625 145.050625 yeah y[ou]- you know what though uh i kind of wish that i would uh watch more local news because_1 i end up uh sometimes missing things and hearing them secondhand just because i never do sit down to watch the real news

sw4235A-ms98-a-0032 161.442125 171.369375 i think that's the way it usually is th[ey]- they work from the you know the headline stories you know those ones basically people being killed and murdered and and suffering then they go into like 
sw4235A-ms98-a-0033 171.369375 177.535750 you know sports and weather then they end up on the really nice stuff so that you're not depressed by the time you're done watching the broadcast

sw4235A-ms98-a-0052 244.750125 246.674625 well i think that's
sw4235A-ms98-a-0053 246.674625 256.764250 uh it's kind of related to like who writes history because_1 obviously the the news eventually does become history it's just always going to be someone's the prevailing opinion
sw4235A-ms98-a-0054 256.764250 259.738375 well unless you have a particularly strong
