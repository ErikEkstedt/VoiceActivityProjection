sw4276A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 8.153250 [noise] uh it was interesting i just read in the paper the other day that they finally sent up the the uh former Soviets whatever you call them_1 now
sw4276A-ms98-a-0002 8.153250 14.978125 recently set up some relief for the guy that's been up orbiting the mirror space [laughter-station] for the last ten months
sw4276A-ms98-a-0003 14.978125 19.034125 [silence]
sw4276A-ms98-a-0004 19.034125 27.555500 boy i would think so that's incredible but could you imagine being in a in such an enclosed area for such a long period of time and totally isolated
sw4276A-ms98-a-0005 27.555500 35.589625 [silence]
sw4276A-ms98-a-0006 35.589625 50.100500 no no i don't think so either i i was also kind of surprised that uh i don't maybe maybe there were technical uh limitations on what could be done but it it seemed like a perfect opportunity for the uh United States space program to
sw4276A-ms98-a-0007 50.100500 58.189875 uh at least offer to get involved with them in in send up some sort of a relief or supplies or something and
sw4276A-ms98-a-0008 58.189875 60.552125 get some sort of a union going
sw4276A-ms98-a-0009 60.552125 69.636000 [silence]
sw4276A-ms98-a-0010 69.636000 72.450750 yeah i hope so i'd like to see something like that
sw4276A-ms98-a-0011 72.450750 88.056250 [silence]
sw4276A-ms98-a-0012 88.056250 96.693125 right how do you feel as far as spending uh the tremendous amounts of money that need to be spent to keep the program going how do you feel about
sw4276A-ms98-a-0013 96.693125 115.964000 [silence]
sw4276A-ms98-a-0014 115.964000 118.832625 right yeah it really is it's uh
sw4276A-ms98-a-0015 118.832625 122.953750 i'd certainly hate to see anything come to a grinding halt
sw4276A-ms98-a-0016 122.953750 132.282625 although i guess uh certain logic could be [laughter-applied] to figure out how much spending it can do in any given year or period of years 
sw4276A-ms98-a-0017 132.282625 145.650875 but i'd like to see you hear talk about this uh future space station that may be built may serve as a a uh intermediate point between like a trip to Mars or something like that and
sw4276A-ms98-a-0018 145.650875 153.003000 seems like the next next big step that needs to be taken is interplanetary travel but that also seems so
sw4276A-ms98-a-0019 153.003000 157.611500 um i don't know like the thing that some the figment of somebody's imagination
sw4276A-ms98-a-0020 157.611500 161.222875 [silence]
sw4276A-ms98-a-0021 161.222875 162.482750 oh
sw4276A-ms98-a-0022 162.482750 170.277000 [silence]
sw4276A-ms98-a-0023 170.277000 171.812250 oh is that right
sw4276A-ms98-a-0024 171.812250 187.632000 [silence]
sw4276A-ms98-a-0025 187.632000 188.964000 oh really
sw4276A-ms98-a-0026 188.964000 193.271000 [silence]
sw4276A-ms98-a-0027 193.271000 201.089750 i would think so i'd certainly think so and then you have the unfortunate mix between military politics and scientific exploration that
sw4276A-ms98-a-0028 201.089750 211.435500 they're uh starting up star wars again evidently and that gets i don't kn[ow]- i think a lot of people lump that into the category of space travel even though it really has nothing to do with
sw4276A-ms98-a-0029 211.435500 214.629000 uh scientific quest for knowledge it's
sw4276A-ms98-a-0030 214.629000 217.634625 more uh paranoid [laughter]
sw4276A-ms98-a-0031 217.634625 220.063125 preventative thing for the military
sw4276A-ms98-a-0032 220.063125 240.849125 [silence]
sw4276A-ms98-a-0033 240.849125 248.591125 definitely definitely in fact it seems uh that a a lot of those benefits were unexpected as far [laughter-as]
sw4276A-ms98-a-0034 248.591125 254.470875 they had plans for these things and they sent them_1 up years and years ago and they never expected them_1 to be still transmitting data back
sw4276A-ms98-a-0035 254.470875 258.139000 that's incredible some of the pictures that have come back
sw4276A-ms98-a-0036 258.139000 271.718375 [silence]
sw4276A-ms98-a-0037 271.718375 277.506250 yeah yeah i agree i think that's definitely been worth while and like you said it's very cost effective and
sw4276A-ms98-a-0038 277.506250 282.296500 probably yields as much information as as having somebody actually up there
sw4276A-ms98-a-0039 282.296500 285.478500 although i sure wouldn't mind being the guy that's actually up there [laughter]
sw4276A-ms98-a-0040 285.478500 288.099000 yeah ye[ah]- i think so
sw4276A-ms98-a-0041 288.099000 291.142625 [silence]
sw4276A-ms98-a-0042 291.142625 294.961125 i i don't think it's glamorous i probably wouldn't enjoy it
sw4276A-ms98-a-0043 294.961125 298.082000 all the time while it was happening but boy could you imagine looking back
