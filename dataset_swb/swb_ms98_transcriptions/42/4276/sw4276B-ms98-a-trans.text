sw4276B-ms98-a-0003 10.862375 12.336000 oh right
sw4276B-ms98-a-0004 12.336000 14.417250 [laughter]
sw4276B-ms98-a-0005 14.417250 19.114000 right i guess he had some culture shock and all the changes that took place while he was in space
sw4276B-ms98-a-0006 19.114000 20.207000 [silence]
sw4276B-ms98-a-0007 20.207000 21.604500 um-hum

sw4276B-ms98-a-0009 25.712875 27.202000 yeah i don't think
sw4276B-ms98-a-0010 27.202000 35.237250 yeah it's it's pretty difficult to imagine i think that they don't have the same considerations for the human being as we do in this country [laughter]
sw4276B-ms98-a-0011 35.237250 57.247750 [silence]

sw4276B-ms98-a-0014 60.502250 69.330500 well i think uh may[be]- something like that may be in the works in the future trying to get some joint ventures between the two countries in terms of space exploration
sw4276B-ms98-a-0015 69.330500 71.725375 [silence]
sw4276B-ms98-a-0016 71.725375 76.570375 yeah i think uh you know the they have a lot of resources over there
sw4276B-ms98-a-0017 76.570375 88.832500 and probably some cheaper labor and things where we could benefit by purchasing booster rockets or maybe something on [vocalized-noise] that we can probably get from them cheaper than we can produce ourselves
sw4276B-ms98-a-0018 88.832500 96.087000 [silence]
sw4276B-ms98-a-0019 96.087000 100.512125 well i don't know i think it's kind of hard to determine
sw4276B-ms98-a-0020 100.512125 113.089000 uh the truth i mean you listen to some sides of the story and they they don't they want to cut funding because they feel that the rewards of exploring space are very limited and then there's others who say we can learn a great deal
sw4276B-ms98-a-0021 113.089000 116.759125 it's kind of hard to figure out what's true and what's not true [laughter]
sw4276B-ms98-a-0022 116.759125 122.338250 [silence]
sw4276B-ms98-a-0023 122.338250 123.668500 um-hum

sw4276B-ms98-a-0030 151.377625 156.699875 [silence]
sw4276B-ms98-a-0031 156.699875 165.947125 yeah definitely at this point it is i have a friend who works for McDonald Douglas in California and there's a prime contractor on the on that space station
sw4276B-ms98-a-0032 165.947125 170.947875 and um i know recently i their funding was at least guaranteed for another year
sw4276B-ms98-a-0033 170.947875 172.591375 so they're going to continue
sw4276B-ms98-a-0034 172.591375 185.753125 but i've also read a lot of bad things about it how they're talking about the value of the space station is very limited in the amount of information that can be gathered is is minimal but
sw4276B-ms98-a-0035 185.753125 193.706875 n[ow]- now that's only one side of the story you know i'm sure if you ask someone from McDonald Douglas they would tell you there's a lot more to be learned from it [laughter]

sw4276B-ms98-a-0042 217.897625 219.267125 well
sw4276B-ms98-a-0043 219.267125 223.730750 i guess i some of the i mean i see a good [noise]
sw4276B-ms98-a-0044 223.730750 232.500500 unmanned type space exploration sending uh satellites and or uh unmanned vehicles into orbit
sw4276B-ms98-a-0045 232.500500 241.282625 or to other planets like Voyager and that sort of thing that seems to be pretty valuable and maybe more cost effective than trying to put human beings into space
sw4276B-ms98-a-0046 241.282625 253.329625 [silence]

sw4276B-ms98-a-0049 257.116750 262.224250 yeah and and in a lot of ways it's improving the technology in terms of um
sw4276B-ms98-a-0050 262.224250 272.306125 signal processing and and data transmission and trying to determine uh a picture from the information the very weak information they're getting back from these signals
sw4276B-ms98-a-0051 272.306125 273.665625 and tha[t's]-

sw4276B-ms98-a-0056 287.436500 292.364000 i don't know i don't know if it's quite as glamorous as it it seems like it would be [laughter]
