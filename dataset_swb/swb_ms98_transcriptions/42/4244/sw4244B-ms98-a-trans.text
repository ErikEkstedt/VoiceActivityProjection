sw4244B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.356500 [noise] 
sw4244B-ms98-a-0002 0.356500 3.452250 [silence] 
sw4244B-ms98-a-0003 3.452250 13.587375 well uh care of the elderly is something that is hitting pretty close to home at me uh right now my father-in-law has uh 
sw4244B-ms98-a-0004 13.587375 16.793750 been diagnosed with terminal cancer 
sw4244B-ms98-a-0005 16.793750 23.903125 and my mother-in-law is in a wheel chair so this is something that i've been thinking quite a bit about lately 
sw4244B-ms98-a-0006 23.903125 25.738500 and uh 
sw4244B-ms98-a-0007 25.738500 33.839250 i'm i feel pretty strongly and the rest of my family does that is long as someone is able to care for 
sw4244B-ms98-a-0008 33.839250 35.665500 uh someone else 
sw4244B-ms98-a-0009 35.665500 48.363000 that they shouldn't be put in a home but there's th[ere's]- a very hard question o[f]- of what happens when someone isn't able to provide that care for themselves 
sw4244B-ms98-a-0010 48.363000 50.000375 um 
sw4244B-ms98-a-0011 50.000375 59.648625 in the case of my mother-in-law she's not able to to bathe herself but she's sharp as a tack at this point and 
sw4244B-ms98-a-0012 59.648625 68.899500 what sort of facilities are available for that person it's hard because you think of a home and you're really thinking of 
sw4244B-ms98-a-0013 68.899500 75.806750 of uh old people left somewhere to uh you know fairly forgotten and that's 
sw4244B-ms98-a-0014 75.806750 80.090625 tha[t's]- that's a hard thing and i'm sure not all of them are like that 
sw4244B-ms98-a-0015 80.090625 81.412625 [silence] 
sw4244B-ms98-a-0016 81.412625 82.582125 yeah 
sw4244B-ms98-a-0017 82.582125 93.291625 so i[t's]- it's very hard to find a facility that would allow uh allow someone of fair degree of autonomy in their life 
sw4244B-ms98-a-0018 93.291625 98.837875 but yet would still be there to help provide some of the basic services 
sw4244B-ms98-a-0019 98.837875 102.759125 [silence] 
sw4244B-ms98-a-0020 102.759125 105.141875 no she's not um 
sw4244B-ms98-a-0021 105.141875 116.313000 she's still at home and her son has has moved back into the house uh wh[ich]- which was not as inconvenient as it sounds because uh 
sw4244B-ms98-a-0022 116.313000 124.310875 um my father-in-law and my brother-in-law have a dental lab in the basement so he was working out of the house anyway 
sw4244B-ms98-a-0023 124.310875 127.561250 uh so i[t]- it's a little less 
sw4244B-ms98-a-0024 127.561250 131.169750 uh i[t's]- it's not all that inconvenient for him 
sw4244B-ms98-a-0025 131.169750 132.112375 but 
sw4244B-ms98-a-0026 132.112375 137.399625 the rest of the kids are scattered uh throughout the northeast 
sw4244B-ms98-a-0027 137.399625 141.442625 and he doesn't want to feel that he's 
sw4244B-ms98-a-0028 141.442625 150.001000 uh he's going to be completely responsible for this only because he happens to live right there with with my in-laws 
sw4244B-ms98-a-0029 150.001000 158.213375 [silence] 
sw4244B-ms98-a-0030 158.213375 166.774125 that that ha[s]- we've all thought about that fortunately uh that doesn't seem to be a big problem but 
sw4244B-ms98-a-0031 166.774125 173.092875 th[at]- we there's some thought that has to be given to to uh 
sw4244B-ms98-a-0032 173.092875 179.237500 to the property for instance they have about four three or four acres in Connecticut 
sw4244B-ms98-a-0033 179.237500 192.681000 and what no one wants to see is uh that land having to be sold off simply to keep her in a in a nursing home what we'd like to do 
sw4244B-ms98-a-0034 192.681000 207.115500 is uh find the sort of place where i t[ry]- described before where [noise] she'd be able to have uh a place of her own but yet also have someone come in a couple of times a day to help her with various 
sw4244B-ms98-a-0035 207.115500 211.543875 various things and have someone there in case she falls or something 
sw4244B-ms98-a-0036 211.543875 217.003625 [silence] 
sw4244B-ms98-a-0037 217.003625 218.262000 um-hum

sw4244B-ms98-a-0041 228.964875 230.001500 that's great 
sw4244B-ms98-a-0042 230.001500 235.632500 [silence] 
sw4244B-ms98-a-0043 235.632500 236.624500 um-hum

sw4244B-ms98-a-0045 241.806125 243.250375 right

sw4244B-ms98-a-0047 248.268000 250.001625 that's that's great 
sw4244B-ms98-a-0048 250.001625 257.552125 [silence]

sw4244B-ms98-a-0051 259.510000 264.490375 i'm hoping that the trend is toward places like that 
sw4244B-ms98-a-0052 264.490375 266.399500 as 
sw4244B-ms98-a-0053 266.399500 270.485500 the population in America uh 
sw4244B-ms98-a-0054 270.485500 275.243625 lives for a longer period of time uh 
sw4244B-ms98-a-0055 275.243625 282.861750 i- i guess thirty years ago when when you were that age and you weren't able to really care for yourself 
sw4244B-ms98-a-0056 282.861750 290.954750 you really weren't going to uh you know be around that much longer and so the level of care required 
sw4244B-ms98-a-0057 290.954750 298.376250 was was different but now people are are living longer and can uh 
sw4244B-ms98-a-0058 298.376250 300.002000 can have injury
