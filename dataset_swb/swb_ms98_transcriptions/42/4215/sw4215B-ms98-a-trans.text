sw4215B-ms98-a-0023 74.921000 82.498625 you know they they just sort of had voluntary trash uh you know bins you could put your plastic in and now they it's they're trying to have um
sw4215B-ms98-a-0024 82.498625 91.866375 a city wide program where they're actually have special trucks to pick up your separated um plastic and glass and uh newspapers
sw4215B-ms98-a-0025 91.866375 100.618625 but well they've they've got trucks for part of the city and and they haven't gotten enough trucks you know manufactured yet to take care of the whole city of Plano
sw4215B-ms98-a-0026 100.618625 107.649250 so some of the people in Plano do have that recycling and it's pick up at their door and you know at their driveway and we don't
sw4215B-ms98-a-0027 107.649250 117.901375 so we still have to take it voluntarily to the library where they have the you know the glass bin and the and the aluminum and and uh but there they don't take plastic
