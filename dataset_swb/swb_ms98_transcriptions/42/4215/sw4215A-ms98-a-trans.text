sw4215A-ms98-a-0009 30.877125 35.182750 there also in areas up their that mandated uh separating your garbage 
sw4215A-ms98-a-0010 35.182750 36.496250 uh
sw4215A-ms98-a-0011 36.496250 38.754625 [silence]
sw4215A-ms98-a-0012 38.754625 41.746375 from the paper i believe even right
sw4215A-ms98-a-0013 41.746375 51.848000 so i know that they're doing and up there and several community down here they're not doing a hole lot down here uh their actually are some community where they mandating that uh most i think it's aluminum from everything else
sw4215A-ms98-a-0014 51.848000 60.765125 and also it's against the law anywhere in the county down here to uh deposit uh yard trash like you know clippings and stuff in the trash

sw4215A-ms98-a-0038 193.537375 200.321375 unfortunately i think that what we are seeing though is like areas like Plano i where it's not as densely populating uh you know the whole area 
sw4215A-ms98-a-0039 200.321375 208.540750 that it is a lot easier for people to uh you know ignore the landfill problem where as New Jersey Massachusetts you know New England [vocalized-noise]
sw4215A-ms98-a-0040 208.540750 209.754875 right
sw4215A-ms98-a-0041 209.754875 213.549500 [silence]
sw4215A-ms98-a-0042 213.549500 221.438750 Massachusetts is getting there well [vocalized-noise] Boston is like Massachusetts is very heavily populated you know western Massachusetts is not

sw4215A-ms98-a-0049 244.341875 256.891125 well [vocalized-noise] there's there's actually some other good ideas that have come up where for example i think this was actually originated in Oklahoma city on the uh where they scrape the uh top of the roads off and they actually remixed that and use it again 
sw4215A-ms98-a-0050 256.891125 260.692125 you know for the asphalt so they're gonna you know trash out 
sw4215A-ms98-a-0051 260.692125 263.159500 [silence]
sw4215A-ms98-a-0052 263.159500 264.877500 so why don't Oklahoma city thought of that

sw4215A-ms98-a-0058 275.661875 279.950375 i- i believe in Baltimore they're recycling glass and using it as part of the asphalt
sw4215A-ms98-a-0059 279.950375 284.176375 yes which they also think it is good because it makes the roads prettier 
sw4215A-ms98-a-0060 284.176375 285.671750 because_1 they sparkle
sw4215A-ms98-a-0061 285.671750 293.782375 [silence]
