sw4277B-ms98-a-0004 4.889125 18.833250 but uh in California you typically have to go through a big long um process that typically cost several million dollars um and there hasn't been anybody um executed here for about twenty years
sw4277B-ms98-a-0005 18.833250 29.085625 [silence]

sw4277B-ms98-a-0014 52.599625 61.562750 but but the the whole controversy is that you you just spend so much money now to either either they have to change the process or um
sw4277B-ms98-a-0015 61.562750 69.691125 uh i don't know do something to to expedite i'm i don't believe uh i really don't have strong feelings either way whether it should be allowed or not
sw4277B-ms98-a-0016 69.691125 75.861500 um i do know that if it was a crime against you know if it'd happen to me
sw4277B-ms98-a-0017 75.861500 80.487625 i think i'd want i'd i- i i'd feel pretty strongly about

sw4277B-ms98-a-0027 123.398375 127.695125 they're getting people through but does it still cost a lot of money to do all this
sw4277B-ms98-a-0028 127.695125 138.940875 [silence]
sw4277B-ms98-a-0029 138.940875 141.081625 yeah it that's amazing

sw4277B-ms98-a-0031 144.308375 150.693750 uh he's like Robert Alton uh Harris or something and i mean his crime was so heinous
sw4277B-ms98-a-0032 150.693750 154.790375 and they're having so much trouble over this guy that
sw4277B-ms98-a-0033 154.790375 162.903000 i[t]- you know in his [vocalized-noise] you know it seems like a clear cut case to me that they're just going to have trouble o[n]- on a lot of these

sw4277B-ms98-a-0050 224.553125 232.787375 yeah i always thought [vocalized-noise] for an interesting idea would be to i don't now let the victims decide what happens to the guy they can forgive them_1
sw4277B-ms98-a-0051 232.787375 234.068375 and
sw4277B-ms98-a-0052 234.068375 235.230625 [silence]
sw4277B-ms98-a-0053 235.230625 241.893500 but i don't know i guess that that's a whole legal question there uh i don't know if they'd want to get into but
sw4277B-ms98-a-0054 241.893500 242.901875 [silence]

sw4277B-ms98-a-0057 255.265250 260.766250 i'm not i'm not sure i th[ink]- i think the figure i just a matter of fact just saw something on TV the other day on this and they
sw4277B-ms98-a-0058 260.766250 268.599625 they said uh it lost cost like twenty thousand dollars a year to keep them_1 in prison it's like a million dollars for them_1 to go through the appeal process
sw4277B-ms98-a-0059 268.599625 270.078250 it's like Jes[us]-
sw4277B-ms98-a-0060 270.078250 271.307750 [noise]
sw4277B-ms98-a-0061 271.307750 272.915500 [silence]
