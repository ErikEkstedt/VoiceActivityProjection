sw4261B-ms98-a-0002 0.987500 7.452750 [silence]
sw4261B-ms98-a-0003 7.452750 16.254375 [laughter] um i haven't either but here recently i w[ith]- with the advent of court TV i've watched a [laughter-little] [laughter-bit] more than
sw4261B-ms98-a-0004 16.254375 23.128125 uh than i would have a probably a year or so ago so i i've been getting a little more interested in court procedures too 
sw4261B-ms98-a-0005 23.128125 40.254250 [silence]
sw4261B-ms98-a-0006 40.254250 46.237625 well uh i guess it could be but i- i- i agree with you in that to the extent that i i think i[t]-
sw4261B-ms98-a-0007 46.237625 56.998250 it largely would be more uniform i think uh as a opposed to a a real mixture of juries with in different locations and different you know ideas
sw4261B-ms98-a-0008 56.998250 64.492750 [silence]
sw4261B-ms98-a-0009 64.492750 65.757750 yeah
sw4261B-ms98-a-0010 65.757750 66.849375 [silence]
sw4261B-ms98-a-0011 66.849375 70.431750 uh i think it was yeah Houston i've been hearing about that yeah
sw4261B-ms98-a-0012 70.431750 78.683625 [silence]
sw4261B-ms98-a-0013 78.683625 81.762875 yeah plus he was getting a lot of uh
sw4261B-ms98-a-0014 81.762875 89.866125 uh criticisms i guess for by different groups you know about just being inhumane you know that sort of thing
sw4261B-ms98-a-0015 89.866125 107.217250 [silence]
sw4261B-ms98-a-0016 107.217250 116.988250 yeah and and the costs are real high i guess of both uh o[f]- of keeping someone in prison and going through the trial procedure the whole whole works uh
sw4261B-ms98-a-0017 116.988250 123.014625 and and that just comes out of the tax money and uh in a lot of cases the uh
sw4261B-ms98-a-0018 123.014625 132.870375 uh the person being tried sometimes you know they do have the means to uh to repay the courts or the victims or the prisons to uh to keep them
sw4261B-ms98-a-0019 132.870375 138.202750 or to perform some sort of more work than is is currently done in most prisons
sw4261B-ms98-a-0020 138.202750 146.442500 [silence]
sw4261B-ms98-a-0021 146.442500 151.866000 yeah yeah [vocalized-noise] they need to make some adjustments on that um
sw4261B-ms98-a-0022 151.866000 158.493250 uh th[e]- the other question i guess that that to be addressed is uh whether uh
sw4261B-ms98-a-0023 158.493250 162.172750 a a verdict should should require unanimous uh
sw4261B-ms98-a-0024 162.172750 164.073750 uh decision
sw4261B-ms98-a-0025 164.073750 177.243750 [silence]
sw4261B-ms98-a-0026 177.243750 179.476375 yeah it
sw4261B-ms98-a-0027 179.476375 189.232250 yeah i- i i don't know but it seems like um [vocalized-noise] everything is so stacked and in favor of the criminal that it's a shame to have
sw4261B-ms98-a-0028 189.232250 199.341750 a a majority that would vote uh guilty and to have just one dissenting vote could jeopardize the whole uh whole process or who[le]- whole verdict to
sw4261B-ms98-a-0029 199.341750 200.827375 [silence]
sw4261B-ms98-a-0030 200.827375 203.451375 and it seems like it should just be
sw4261B-ms98-a-0031 203.451375 211.456375 uh some come up with some sort of majority maybe um uh maybe a two thirds or a three quarters majority or something because_1 it's
sw4261B-ms98-a-0032 211.456375 216.777125 it's hard to get every single person to to agree on anything like you say
sw4261B-ms98-a-0033 216.777125 221.474000 [silence]
sw4261B-ms98-a-0034 221.474000 234.616125 well it has to right now it has to be unanimous on most of those decisions if not it's a hung jury and uh they're asked to stay in and try to come up with the unanimous verdict and then if eventually it's uh
sw4261B-ms98-a-0035 234.616125 242.638000 uh not unanimous even by one vote it's sometimes i- i think it's either thrown out or they have to go for retrial
sw4261B-ms98-a-0036 242.638000 248.863250 um even if just one person is is holding out or can't be convinced to uh to vote guilty
sw4261B-ms98-a-0037 248.863250 250.039500 [noise]
sw4261B-ms98-a-0038 250.039500 255.488250 yeah i mean that's really a r[eally]- r[eally]- really a lot of cost to uh to bring that to trial again
sw4261B-ms98-a-0039 255.488250 265.021000 [silence]
sw4261B-ms98-a-0040 265.021000 272.569375 yeah the[y]- it needs some some revising and i heard that this is a little unrelated i guess but i heard uh
sw4261B-ms98-a-0041 272.569375 281.526875 what was it the other day it said to for someone who's convicted and put on death row it was i[t]- it was up in the millions what it costs
sw4261B-ms98-a-0042 281.526875 288.836875 to keep that person and then to execute that person at the time y[ou]- y[ou]- you know it usually takes years to do that
sw4261B-ms98-a-0043 288.836875 292.723250 [noise] just all the appeals processes that goes on and
sw4261B-ms98-a-0044 292.723250 297.922000 yeah and that was just uh amazing that they were talking about a millions of dollars per
