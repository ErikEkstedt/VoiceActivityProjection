sw4261A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 8.421625 [noise] served on jury duty but it's ironic because i have a summons here for the thirtieth which is the Monday after next and i'll be a little more authoritative on this after then
sw4261A-ms98-a-0002 8.421625 9.949375 but um
sw4261A-ms98-a-0003 9.949375 19.127000 [silence]
sw4261A-ms98-a-0004 19.127000 20.567750 um
sw4261A-ms98-a-0005 20.567750 23.089000 [silence]
sw4261A-ms98-a-0006 23.089000 35.050625 yeah i would think that um sentencing would be the kind of thing that an expert system would be ideal for you know there's a whole bunch of evidence that's supposed to be weighed and for nice uniform sentencing for particular things
sw4261A-ms98-a-0007 35.050625 40.483125 it would um seem like the perfect solution but i suppose that would be really subject to abuse as well
sw4261A-ms98-a-0008 40.483125 56.609875 [silence]
sw4261A-ms98-a-0009 56.609875 61.446875 yeah there's so much variation in sentencing like this guy recently that um
sw4261A-ms98-a-0010 61.446875 67.303125 there was some guy that was convicted and he volunteered to be castrated i guess that was down in your area uh
sw4261A-ms98-a-0011 67.303125 70.915875 [silence]
sw4261A-ms98-a-0012 70.915875 79.354500 and then here they've gone and um no surgeon could be found to perform the job so the judge went and withdrew the whole idea or something like that
sw4261A-ms98-a-0013 79.354500 89.376625 [silence]
sw4261A-ms98-a-0014 89.376625 100.885625 yeah one thing i would certainly like to see is that um criminals be sentenced to some sort of a uh a means of paying for their um incarceration
sw4261A-ms98-a-0015 100.885625 108.024000 i think that's that's reasonable those of us on this side of uh the justice system have to pay pay our way through life
sw4261A-ms98-a-0016 108.024000 115.841375 [silence]
sw4261A-ms98-a-0017 115.841375 117.593000 yeah absolutely
sw4261A-ms98-a-0018 117.593000 132.243250 [silence]
sw4261A-ms98-a-0019 132.243250 133.639375 really
sw4261A-ms98-a-0020 133.639375 138.546375 [silence]
sw4261A-ms98-a-0021 138.546375 143.154250 yeah i would think there's a lot that a lot of production that c[ould]- could be done um
sw4261A-ms98-a-0022 143.154250 146.944125 you know with people like that whether totally unskilled or not
sw4261A-ms98-a-0023 146.944125 164.201500 [silence]
sw4261A-ms98-a-0024 164.201500 165.712875 that's a tough one
sw4261A-ms98-a-0025 165.712875 175.501750 we seem to as a group have such a hard time all agreeing and what is it they say about democracy the flaws of democracy [noise] is that nobody will um
sw4261A-ms98-a-0026 175.501750 180.969375 agree on anything or it's hard to get everybody to agree on something i can't there's some saying i can't remember what it is
sw4261A-ms98-a-0027 180.969375 198.197875 [silence]
sw4261A-ms98-a-0028 198.197875 200.665375 yeah really that's a really good point
sw4261A-ms98-a-0029 200.665375 216.364500 [silence]
sw4261A-ms98-a-0030 216.364500 222.796875 how is it now do you know do they have it so that if um some certain percentage agrees then or
sw4261A-ms98-a-0031 222.796875 242.096000 [silence]
sw4261A-ms98-a-0032 242.096000 243.486125 hum
sw4261A-ms98-a-0033 243.486125 248.531250 [silence]
sw4261A-ms98-a-0034 248.531250 250.751750 more time and expense
sw4261A-ms98-a-0035 250.751750 255.931750 [silence]
sw4261A-ms98-a-0036 255.931750 257.663875 very interesting
sw4261A-ms98-a-0037 257.663875 265.273125 yeah there seems to be a lot of problems with the uh criminal justice system in America today i'm certainly no one to have the answers
sw4261A-ms98-a-0038 265.273125 286.056625 [silence]
sw4261A-ms98-a-0039 286.056625 287.882125 hum
sw4261A-ms98-a-0040 287.882125 290.081375 unbelievably i
sw4261A-ms98-a-0041 290.081375 291.475750 [silence]
sw4261A-ms98-a-0042 291.475750 295.597750 yeah and they're all automatic too for a long ways at least
sw4261A-ms98-a-0043 295.597750 297.922000 [silence]
