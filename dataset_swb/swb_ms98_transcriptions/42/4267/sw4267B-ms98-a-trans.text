sw4267B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.006375 [noise]
sw4267B-ms98-a-0002 1.006375 5.442250 [silence]
sw4267B-ms98-a-0003 5.442250 9.911625 well i guess i'd probably put myself on about a five i'm kind of in the middle on that
sw4267B-ms98-a-0004 9.911625 18.830750 i think that there's uh there are some guns that i just can't think of any reason why anybody would want to have them_1 unless they just want to go shoot somebody
sw4267B-ms98-a-0005 18.830750 26.798125 but on the other hand i think there's a lot of legitimate use for guns too and i don't see any reason why we should do any sort of control or uh
sw4267B-ms98-a-0006 26.798125 35.696000 certainly no sort of you know serious restrictions on those for example hunting and things like that and even some self-defense things so how do you feel about it
sw4267B-ms98-a-0007 35.696000 38.837625 [silence]
sw4267B-ms98-a-0008 38.837625 40.205250 okay
sw4267B-ms98-a-0009 40.205250 49.279125 [silence]
sw4267B-ms98-a-0010 49.279125 50.488375 um-hum
sw4267B-ms98-a-0011 50.488375 52.010375 [silence]
sw4267B-ms98-a-0012 52.010375 56.029375 i don't know i know some people who hunt and uh you know
sw4267B-ms98-a-0013 56.029375 59.935375 [silence]
sw4267B-ms98-a-0014 59.935375 61.518250 uh
sw4267B-ms98-a-0015 61.518250 66.302750 [silence]
sw4267B-ms98-a-0016 66.302750 67.702000 um-hum
sw4267B-ms98-a-0017 67.702000 70.132250 [silence]
sw4267B-ms98-a-0018 70.132250 74.801875 yeah well it seems like most of the people who get hurt from them_1 get hurt from handguns
sw4267B-ms98-a-0019 74.801875 83.041250 and so i look at somebody like you know who's got a you know maybe a a twenty two caliber rifle or something like that if you know good for
sw4267B-ms98-a-0020 83.041250 95.656500 for you know maybe hunting some small you know animal or something like that you know i ne[ver]- i never hear a reports of people you know shooting each other with things like that unless they're out in the woods and drunk and then of course that's a that's [laughter-another] problem
sw4267B-ms98-a-0021 95.656500 96.924125 but
sw4267B-ms98-a-0022 96.924125 104.732375 [silence]
sw4267B-ms98-a-0023 104.732375 106.006375 um-hum
sw4267B-ms98-a-0024 106.006375 110.408250 [silence]
sw4267B-ms98-a-0025 110.408250 112.000000 yeah
sw4267B-ms98-a-0026 112.000000 113.577875 um-hum
sw4267B-ms98-a-0027 113.577875 125.969500 yeah i agree that there's a real problem with uh with injuries and things like that uh sound like we both agree on the fact that things like semiautomatic rifles and and things like that i mean they uh
sw4267B-ms98-a-0028 125.969500 140.058375 i think we both agree that there's there's no uh at least use that i legitimate use that i can think of for a semiautomatic rifle except to kill people i mean that's what they were designed for and that's what they're good for
sw4267B-ms98-a-0029 140.058375 146.128625 now you know i suppose if if there was some way that we could render them unusable
sw4267B-ms98-a-0030 146.128625 147.346500 the[n]-
sw4267B-ms98-a-0031 147.346500 148.646875 yeah
sw4267B-ms98-a-0032 148.646875 150.087875 [silence]
sw4267B-ms98-a-0033 150.087875 160.602750 yeah i guess if there were some absolute definite way that you could you could make something like that unusable then i [vocalized-noise] then i probably wouldn't have a problem with a collector having one
sw4267B-ms98-a-0034 160.602750 168.571875 but i don't know how to do that uh without you know even pouring cement down the barrels probably way to get around that
sw4267B-ms98-a-0035 168.571875 172.627500 [silence]
sw4267B-ms98-a-0036 172.627500 173.950625 yeah
sw4267B-ms98-a-0037 173.950625 175.933750 [silence]
sw4267B-ms98-a-0038 175.933750 177.304750 um-hum
sw4267B-ms98-a-0039 177.304750 180.223500 [silence]
sw4267B-ms98-a-0040 180.223500 184.135375 yeah and i think even with a total ban there'll always be guns available
sw4267B-ms98-a-0041 184.135375 190.334625 but at that point you know i guess i don't realistically think there's anything you can do about that
sw4267B-ms98-a-0042 190.334625 195.770125 you know y[ou]- you can certainly make the possession o[f]- of of of such weapons you know
sw4267B-ms98-a-0043 195.770125 199.216375 you know the penalties for that very very very strict
sw4267B-ms98-a-0044 199.216375 208.612625 but i- i guess i feel like you know just like anything else you know you know there's lots of illegal things out there that people that people a[re]- you know still getting
sw4267B-ms98-a-0045 208.612625 217.056125 but i also ascribe to the theory that you know you know guns guns don't kill people people kill people i mean that that seems to me to be wrong
sw4267B-ms98-a-0046 217.056125 223.299250 i think i think [laughter-guns] [laughter-do] kill people and that you know you know let's face it i mean if you got a gun
sw4267B-ms98-a-0047 223.299250 231.629750 it's so much easier in the heat of an argument or something to to hurt somebody than it is with a knife or [vocalized-noise]
sw4267B-ms98-a-0048 231.629750 236.069875 [silence]
sw4267B-ms98-a-0049 236.069875 237.566000 um-hum
sw4267B-ms98-a-0050 237.566000 241.852000 [silence]
sw4267B-ms98-a-0051 241.852000 243.251250 that's right
sw4267B-ms98-a-0052 243.251250 254.589875 that's right but you know it's interesting there was an incident here in Rochester a a few days ago where uh some people were having a real heavy argument and the guy pulled out a knife and killed the other two people
sw4267B-ms98-a-0053 254.589875 265.593250 so you know i[t]- i[t]- it goes to sh[ow]- i[t]- it does prove that even even you know g[un]- gun control certainly has a place but it's not going to be the the cure all of all society's ills
sw4267B-ms98-a-0054 265.593250 273.070750 [silence]
sw4267B-ms98-a-0055 273.070750 274.380750 yeah
sw4267B-ms98-a-0056 274.380750 279.007250 [silence]
sw4267B-ms98-a-0057 279.007250 280.227000 um-hum
sw4267B-ms98-a-0058 280.227000 281.800125 [silence]
sw4267B-ms98-a-0059 281.800125 283.093250 no i
sw4267B-ms98-a-0060 283.093250 284.942125 [silence]
sw4267B-ms98-a-0061 284.942125 289.477625 i think that's an extremist position and i and i don't really subscribe to it either
sw4267B-ms98-a-0062 289.477625 293.405875 i think on the you know like i said i think there are some legitimate
sw4267B-ms98-a-0063 293.405875 298.018000 you know uses for guns and that's why i kind of put myself at a five but
