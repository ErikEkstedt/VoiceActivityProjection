sw4267A-ms98-a-0005 35.024375 39.702125 i'd probably be closer to uh on the one side [laughter]
sw4267A-ms98-a-0006 39.702125 50.028500 [laughter-i] don't really see the need for it um typically only thing that ever gets pro[duced]- you know that occurs when you have one is you end up shooting some family member or some kid in the house
sw4267A-ms98-a-0007 50.028500 52.733375 that's about the only good that ever comes from it
sw4267A-ms98-a-0008 52.733375 54.001000 [silence]
sw4267A-ms98-a-0009 54.001000 60.583750 well i yeah you could i mean but do they necessarily have to keep them_1 at home to do that
sw4267A-ms98-a-0010 60.583750 70.787625 i mean maybe there's a way they can be uh maintained in a a certain location i don't know but i don't know if individual ownership is necessary

sw4267A-ms98-a-0018 91.784375 93.925000 that's true
sw4267A-ms98-a-0019 93.925000 96.547000 right that's true
sw4267A-ms98-a-0020 96.547000 105.511250 yeah mostly i guess handguns a[re]- are create the problems but a lot of people would come back and say well uh you they need it for shooting range and that sort of thing but
sw4267A-ms98-a-0021 105.511250 106.527375 [silence]
sw4267A-ms98-a-0022 106.527375 114.299250 once again i think i[t]- it may be better to keep the guns uh there and l[et]- they can go there and and use them_1 if that's all they need it for
sw4267A-ms98-a-0023 114.299250 122.718250 [silence]
sw4267A-ms98-a-0024 122.718250 123.977500 sure

sw4267A-ms98-a-0037 167.679875 176.714375 yeah i do[n't]- i don't openly i don't i think any gu[n]- any gun can be modified to to ce[rtain]- a certain extent to be used as a weapon
sw4267A-ms98-a-0038 176.714375 181.635750 so without a total ban there's always going to be guns available but
sw4267A-ms98-a-0039 181.635750 183.530875 [silence]
sw4267A-ms98-a-0040 183.530875 184.903500 right

sw4267A-ms98-a-0053 229.942125 236.780125 right that's yeah for example what happened just the other evening uh Evander Holyfield's brother [laughter]
sw4267A-ms98-a-0054 236.780125 242.200375 uh you know they had some kind of disagreement or whatever and next thing you knew he was shot and dead

sw4267A-ms98-a-0058 263.500750 267.494125 sure sure but i guess uh
sw4267A-ms98-a-0059 267.494125 281.782375 if you look at the NRA's position on it they tend to say that they don't want they really don't want to have any restrictions because they feel that once you get one and it's start[s]- it be gets easier and it may snowball into more restrictions i don't really respect that position
sw4267A-ms98-a-0060 281.782375 285.934875 and i think they're kind of getting out of touch with reality in some of their stances
