sw4288A-ms98-a-0023 90.598125 103.277500 if you can if you can f[ind]- help them to find their niche you know they'll they'll really grow to love it but if you force them_1 in to something that they're not real keen on they'll rebel on it and at least the ones i've seen
sw4288A-ms98-a-0024 103.277500 108.233875 you know and and they a[nd]- they they struggle against it and they want out of it as fast as they can

sw4288A-ms98-a-0031 131.382625 134.390750 and something i don't know the Peace Corps
sw4288A-ms98-a-0032 134.390750 141.135250 signing up and going away [laughter] i mean i've got a real good support system with my family and such like that
sw4288A-ms98-a-0033 141.135250 147.985750 you know and and they're the ones that you know i i i think family can make a really big difference in in sticking something out
sw4288A-ms98-a-0034 147.985750 156.835875 you know and so you know as long as you don't pull them_1 away from their family to to to take them_1 off somewhere to do something you know you've got a better chance of making it work
sw4288A-ms98-a-0035 156.835875 160.882875 [silence]

sw4288A-ms98-a-0042 197.660375 199.113875 well i'd
sw4288A-ms98-a-0043 199.113875 201.786625 i i had never i didn't know that they were
sw4288A-ms98-a-0044 201.786625 205.614500 trying to push through a law or anything to make kids do this
sw4288A-ms98-a-0045 205.614500 219.810000 i that whenever they brought this up that kind of caught me off guard you know i think you know the way i got into mine was they did it it they started it in junior high school and it could just be like an extracurricular club that you could become involved in
sw4288A-ms98-a-0046 219.810000 221.997875 and you could do as little or as much
sw4288A-ms98-a-0047 221.997875 235.173625 and you decided how much involvement that you got which you know a lot of people dropped out but we have a lot we have a large number of people that were it was introduced to that way that has stayed with it and had grown with the organization
sw4288A-ms98-a-0048 235.173625 236.523625 [silence]
sw4288A-ms98-a-0049 236.523625 237.756125 does that make sense

sw4288A-ms98-a-0057 279.306625 282.631000 right well that's true um
sw4288A-ms98-a-0058 282.631000 293.393875 and and it one other thing you've got to really look at is uh depending on what age group you're going to involve you know be it high school or whatever you've got to have good adult mentors
sw4288A-ms98-a-0059 293.393875 294.702125 you know
sw4288A-ms98-a-0060 294.702125 300.162000 because otherwise you get into this situation of you're too young to do any of this
