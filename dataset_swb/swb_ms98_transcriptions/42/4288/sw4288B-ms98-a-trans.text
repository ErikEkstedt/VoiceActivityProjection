sw4288B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.389125 [noise] <b_aside> tell you what this is later [laughter] <e_aside>
sw4288B-ms98-a-0002 1.389125 23.540000 [silence]
sw4288B-ms98-a-0003 23.540000 28.913875 yeah i'd say ten years is a good while especially do is yours on a renewal basis is it
sw4288B-ms98-a-0004 28.913875 32.600250 do you have to renew each year or [noise]
sw4288B-ms98-a-0005 32.600250 33.944625 [noise]
sw4288B-ms98-a-0006 33.944625 39.531750 [silence]
sw4288B-ms98-a-0007 39.531750 46.436375 uh do you have a do you have a minimum requirement for your community service is there a commitment like a term commit[ment]-
sw4288B-ms98-a-0008 46.436375 52.186000 [silence]
sw4288B-ms98-a-0009 52.186000 53.604250 oh really
sw4288B-ms98-a-0010 53.604250 62.300875 [silence]
sw4288B-ms98-a-0011 62.300875 65.906250 gosh that must of you must have seen a lot of exciting
sw4288B-ms98-a-0012 65.906250 69.823875 things and i think that would be good for youth because it would
sw4288B-ms98-a-0013 69.823875 71.264000 just
sw4288B-ms98-a-0014 71.264000 78.125875 be an experience that they it would be difficult to get under a lot of circumstances unless you're involved in some ki[nd]- kind of
sw4288B-ms98-a-0015 78.125875 79.405125 group
sw4288B-ms98-a-0016 79.405125 108.116125 [silence]
sw4288B-ms98-a-0017 108.116125 114.887250 yeah i could see that happening um i- i would think with enough publicity there's got to be a wide enough variety of
sw4288B-ms98-a-0018 114.887250 120.843750 uh groups that they could volunteer with that they if they didn't find their niche in one group if if they're if
sw4288B-ms98-a-0019 120.843750 127.883125 groups were enough were publicized enough they could just know what they could know what their options were for other groups to try
sw4288B-ms98-a-0020 127.883125 130.694250 and other services to contribute
sw4288B-ms98-a-0021 130.694250 147.332250 [silence]
sw4288B-ms98-a-0022 147.332250 149.112625 oh absolutely
sw4288B-ms98-a-0023 149.112625 156.640625 [silence]
sw4288B-ms98-a-0024 156.640625 164.345125 yeah i think the Peace Corps would be uh scary for a lot of people because of that isolation [noise] even if they were in teams it would be [noise]
sw4288B-ms98-a-0025 164.345125 169.843250 a little more conducive i think to a to a fellowship feel in that c[ould]- they could draw a support from
sw4288B-ms98-a-0026 169.843250 176.846375 but i understand that a lot of them_1 are uh well i certainly don't know any statistic but
sw4288B-ms98-a-0027 176.846375 180.752125 that a lot are are working individually and um
sw4288B-ms98-a-0028 180.752125 188.038375 i guess that'd be it i[t]- i would find i find it hard to imagine maintaining an incentive i or maybe not
sw4288B-ms98-a-0029 188.038375 189.985875 incentive but uh
sw4288B-ms98-a-0030 189.985875 192.055875 just
sw4288B-ms98-a-0031 192.055875 194.770500 keeping a focus on the goal
sw4288B-ms98-a-0032 194.770500 237.055000 [silence]
sw4288B-ms98-a-0033 237.055000 240.223250 yeah i think that does make sense um
sw4288B-ms98-a-0034 240.223250 241.439750 [silence]
sw4288B-ms98-a-0035 241.439750 246.955000 you'd have to uh i think ha[ving]- having the individual who's volunteering set their own pace
sw4288B-ms98-a-0036 246.955000 248.842750 for development in the program would
sw4288B-ms98-a-0037 248.842750 258.615625 would be key to just s[taying]- staying away from that feeling of being forced into it whether they were officially forced into it or just the pressure was so high to stay in or meet a
sw4288B-ms98-a-0038 258.615625 262.911500 you know minimum requirement of time commitment that uh
sw4288B-ms98-a-0039 262.911500 266.965750 you know uh but then i think you almost reach a point where
sw4288B-ms98-a-0040 266.965750 270.803625 i[f]- if you pad everything too much it kind of takes away
sw4288B-ms98-a-0041 270.803625 275.747875 the experience i mean the experience of sacrificing i guess is what i'm thinking
sw4288B-ms98-a-0042 275.747875 279.663125 does making of going over[board]- o[verboard]- overboard almost
sw4288B-ms98-a-0043 279.663125 298.598750 [silence]
sw4288B-ms98-a-0044 298.598750 300.162000 yeah
