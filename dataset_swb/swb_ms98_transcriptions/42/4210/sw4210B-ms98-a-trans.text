sw4210B-ms98-a-0003 1.982375 7.053750 in Philadelphia i think the worst is cars
sw4210B-ms98-a-0004 7.053750 13.435000 because_1 there isn't a lot of manufacturing right in Philadelphia any more at least not any heavy manufacturing
sw4210B-ms98-a-0005 13.435000 17.471500 [silence]
sw4210B-ms98-a-0006 17.471500 27.620875 right a lot of pollution from cars and also the trucks that drive around through so i think transportation is the worst right here in the city
sw4210B-ms98-a-0007 27.620875 31.004375 [silence]
sw4210B-ms98-a-0008 31.004375 33.045500 oh right uh-huh
sw4210B-ms98-a-0009 33.045500 34.381875 uh-huh

sw4210B-ms98-a-0012 41.893625 43.910250 [silence]
sw4210B-ms98-a-0013 43.910250 45.173750 right

sw4210B-ms98-a-0015 50.114375 56.925375 well you know in Philadelphia they've got these g[as]- vapor recovery nozzle on all the gas tank now
sw4210B-ms98-a-0016 56.925375 61.992750 if you go to the gas pump you it just sucks it back out
sw4210B-ms98-a-0017 61.992750 64.303375 [silence]
sw4210B-ms98-a-0018 64.303375 67.805000 it makes it really hard to tell when your tank is full though
sw4210B-ms98-a-0019 67.805000 70.763750 because_1 you can't really lessen very well
sw4210B-ms98-a-0020 70.763750 74.099500 you have to just trust the automatic shut off
sw4210B-ms98-a-0021 74.099500 78.691750 so you can't really get it full if you are going on a long its really hard
sw4210B-ms98-a-0022 78.691750 86.461125 [silence]
sw4210B-ms98-a-0023 86.461125 89.883750 yeah from all the gas stoves and everything yeah

sw4210B-ms98-a-0062 228.572625 234.542000 right when people come in and they're smoking while they're waiting for their clothes and you take yours out
sw4210B-ms98-a-0063 234.542000 238.945125 and they're all clean and you want to hang them_1 up and
sw4210B-ms98-a-0064 238.945125 241.885625 there all these people smoking there
sw4210B-ms98-a-0065 241.885625 247.142625 fortunately i've started going at an hour where not many people smoke
sw4210B-ms98-a-0066 247.142625 249.019750 but

sw4210B-ms98-a-0073 269.137750 275.570500 but if there was as many people smoking cigars as there were cigarettes cigar smoke would definitely be worst
sw4210B-ms98-a-0074 275.570500 297.695500 [silence]
sw4210B-ms98-a-0075 297.695500 299.042000 oh right
