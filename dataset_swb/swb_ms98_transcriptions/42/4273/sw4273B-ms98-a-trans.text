sw4273B-ms98-a-0002 0.049625 9.540000 yeah well i i can tell you here's an interesting interesting story uh my wife uh when we first had our kids decided to home school our kids
sw4273B-ms98-a-0003 9.540000 10.748625 a[nd]-
sw4273B-ms98-a-0004 10.748625 14.455625 [silence]
sw4273B-ms98-a-0005 14.455625 21.463250 yeah it's it's interestingly uh there're a couple of different ca[tegories]- categories of home school uh children
sw4273B-ms98-a-0006 21.463250 24.532375 uh a lot of people take religious exemptions
sw4273B-ms98-a-0007 24.532375 32.492000 and those are the people you probably read about all the time in the news you know somebody's somebody's trying to you know get rid of evolution or something and
sw4273B-ms98-a-0008 32.492000 38.264375 and you know so they don't want their kid to go to school to find out that you know the kid really comes out of the cabbage patch [noise]
sw4273B-ms98-a-0009 38.264375 46.787625 but uh [laughter] but in our case uh we actually did it uh we took uh educational you know whatever
sw4273B-ms98-a-0010 46.787625 54.629750 uh because we both had advanced degrees and so we just said uh hey look you know we have enough education to to school our kids
sw4273B-ms98-a-0011 54.629750 65.208125 and the idea was when we first started was to just do elementary school uh level instead of the public schools and do that at at home uh eight six uh eight seven and four
sw4273B-ms98-a-0012 65.208125 71.112875 uh so pretty young kids and so anyway my wife did all of this all of this schooling
sw4273B-ms98-a-0013 71.112875 77.846250 and uh you know she had curricula that she bought that they actually sell which we never knew of um
sw4273B-ms98-a-0014 77.846250 85.067500 you know it was really complete i mean uh it matched up pretty well with with uh actually ma[tched]- i thought was better than a lot of the public school curricula but
sw4273B-ms98-a-0015 85.067500 93.801625 anyway you know you could if you were really religious of course you could get all uh sort of a religious stuff with all the the creation and stuff slant on it
sw4273B-ms98-a-0016 93.801625 98.307500 but uh there's actually a lot of uh to us anyway there's a lot of other good stuff out there too
sw4273B-ms98-a-0017 98.307500 104.590625 so we got a couple actually bought a couple of these programs and for grades you know one through six
sw4273B-ms98-a-0018 104.590625 105.687000 [silence]
sw4273B-ms98-a-0019 105.687000 107.754625 yeah e[xactly]- exactly
sw4273B-ms98-a-0020 107.754625 110.644000 and uh so you know went through it
sw4273B-ms98-a-0021 110.644000 117.959500 and uh anyway my my wife got to the third grade point with my with my daughter
sw4273B-ms98-a-0022 117.959500 120.692375 a[nd]- the oldest one the eight year old
sw4273B-ms98-a-0023 120.692375 122.960375 got to the third grade point
sw4273B-ms98-a-0024 122.960375 127.311000 and it was just too much i mean it was just the kids were just
sw4273B-ms98-a-0025 127.311000 137.234750 you know they needed they just needed other kids to be learning with you know and uh also it was a tremendous amount of work
sw4273B-ms98-a-0026 137.234750 142.832750 [silence]
sw4273B-ms98-a-0027 142.832750 144.257250 right
sw4273B-ms98-a-0028 144.257250 145.814500 exactly
sw4273B-ms98-a-0029 145.814500 156.359750 now it was easier it was actually easier as the younger ones got older because she could just you know kind of take what she had before just the same the same thing that public school teachers do now i mean the
sw4273B-ms98-a-0030 156.359750 157.972875 but i[t]- it w[as]-
sw4273B-ms98-a-0031 157.972875 158.989875 [silence]
sw4273B-ms98-a-0032 158.989875 162.577375 uh she did it for three years
sw4273B-ms98-a-0033 162.577375 173.194625 and and actually the kids did really you know uh if you if you believe the tests that uh the state hands out here you know they're supposed to test your uh your
sw4273B-ms98-a-0034 173.194625 174.913750 [silence]
sw4273B-ms98-a-0035 174.913750 176.539250 yeah
sw4273B-ms98-a-0036 176.539250 179.809625 right they took a standardized test and uh
sw4273B-ms98-a-0037 179.809625 184.667750 they they always did really well uh and they never seemed to have any problem with it
sw4273B-ms98-a-0038 184.667750 197.829625 but i can see in a lot of cases like i[t]- i[t]- we didn't in a case where you've got people at home where they don't for for you know almost the you know political reasons or whatever they don't want their kids to go to school
sw4273B-ms98-a-0039 197.829625 211.553875 i mean that testing can be really bogus you know because_1 we knew people in uh the home schoolers associations there that just they were just blatant cheaters [laughter-and] [laughter-i] [laughter-mean] if their kid didn't do well yeah i mean they just filled it out themselves it was absurd you know
sw4273B-ms98-a-0040 211.553875 213.427625 [silence]
sw4273B-ms98-a-0041 213.427625 216.077375 oh no no they sent them_1 to you
sw4273B-ms98-a-0042 216.077375 217.094375 [silence]
sw4273B-ms98-a-0043 217.094375 226.332375 yeah so you know for us we actually sat our kid down and timed them_1 and everything you know just make it seem like like the real pressure you'd be under
sw4273B-ms98-a-0044 226.332375 233.953500 but uh you know we heard s[tories]- we heard all kinds of stories of people you know it's like well if my kid doesn't do well on it i'll just write in the answers you know uh [noise]
sw4273B-ms98-a-0045 233.953500 236.316000 [laughter]
sw4273B-ms98-a-0046 236.316000 243.718250 [silence]
sw4273B-ms98-a-0047 243.718250 248.058375 y[es]- we did that yes that was the reason but we did that out of total ignorance
sw4273B-ms98-a-0048 248.058375 251.955375 because we never went to the schools to find out what they really were doing [laughter]
sw4273B-ms98-a-0049 251.955375 261.511500 it was [laughter-just] [laughter-sort] [laughter-of] it was just sort of uh you know hey we remember what public school was like and it was really crappy my wife actually was she's from the Bronx in New York so you know
sw4273B-ms98-a-0050 261.511500 264.287625 she knew that public schools could be pretty bad
sw4273B-ms98-a-0051 264.287625 265.628500 and uh
sw4273B-ms98-a-0052 265.628500 269.705000 [silence]
sw4273B-ms98-a-0053 269.705000 271.000000 yeah
sw4273B-ms98-a-0054 271.000000 272.013875 [silence]
sw4273B-ms98-a-0055 272.013875 278.688375 oh actually we didn't really begrudge that you know because_1 i mean it's like you know [vocalized-noise] me i mean it's g[ood]- it's good that uh
sw4273B-ms98-a-0056 278.688375 282.422250 t[o]- you know my opinion is that they should there should be a public school
sw4273B-ms98-a-0057 282.422250 295.297500 they they shouldn't make everybody go to it i mean you should be able to go to other schools or if you know if people have the credentials to home school well leave them_1 alone but but uh you know as far as the taxes go i mean i don't yeah yeah big deal nah
sw4273B-ms98-a-0058 295.297500 297.722875 [silence]
sw4273B-ms98-a-0059 297.722875 299.522000 right
