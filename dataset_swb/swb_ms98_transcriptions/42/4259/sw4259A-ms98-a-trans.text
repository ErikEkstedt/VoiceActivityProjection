sw4259A-ms98-a-0004 3.486625 13.988625 well for myself it's the printed media um only on occasion do i i watch the television for any news because by that time it's so glossed over it's not even funny
sw4259A-ms98-a-0005 13.988625 17.483500 um the radio i've yet to find
sw4259A-ms98-a-0006 17.483500 18.736000 [silence]
sw4259A-ms98-a-0007 18.736000 22.282875 [laughter] so true so true
sw4259A-ms98-a-0008 22.282875 25.489875 [silence]
sw4259A-ms98-a-0009 25.489875 26.998625 yeah
sw4259A-ms98-a-0010 26.998625 32.296875 that's right you know details at eleven while the earth is cracking in half
sw4259A-ms98-a-0011 32.296875 42.996500 you know um but myself i go for the printed media and well one one new show which i do watch on occasion is McNeal Lehrer on public television
sw4259A-ms98-a-0012 42.996500 48.957375 and that's because they can take the time to get into the new story and they don't go for the hype and all that stuff
sw4259A-ms98-a-0013 48.957375 58.491625 it appears to me that the news media for the most part is uh doing its darndest to appeal to the lowest common denominator and
sw4259A-ms98-a-0014 58.491625 59.498625 [silence]
sw4259A-ms98-a-0015 59.498625 61.814375 oh buddy

sw4259A-ms98-a-0042 144.162125 153.243375 [silence]
sw4259A-ms98-a-0043 153.243375 160.570500 oh yeah i mean heard more i heard more about Jennifer Flowers than i hear[d]- i have heard about Bill Clinton's uh platform on health care 
sw4259A-ms98-a-0044 160.570500 162.119375 yeah
sw4259A-ms98-a-0045 162.119375 163.735500 [silence]
sw4259A-ms98-a-0046 163.735500 166.599500 oh yeah [laughter-thank] you [laughter]
sw4259A-ms98-a-0047 166.599500 174.424875 yeah that's right well as i always like to say back when he was talking about a thousand points of light that's a nice way of saying our platform is full of holes
sw4259A-ms98-a-0048 174.424875 176.647750 [silence]
sw4259A-ms98-a-0049 176.647750 179.053875 hey there you go [laughter]
sw4259A-ms98-a-0050 179.053875 181.901500 i'll make that into a tag line in my system
sw4259A-ms98-a-0051 181.901500 183.572000 all right
sw4259A-ms98-a-0052 183.572000 187.696250 [noise] oh goodness but i don't know for the most part
sw4259A-ms98-a-0053 187.696250 197.599750 i see the media for the most part pandering like i said to the lowest common denominator because when it gets down to the nitty-gritty and the brass tacks it gets real unpopular
sw4259A-ms98-a-0054 197.599750 203.005250 and it looses advertisers and it looses starts hurting in the budget so it has to cater somewhere
sw4259A-ms98-a-0055 203.005250 204.105125 [silence]
sw4259A-ms98-a-0056 204.105125 206.536750 yeah infotainment
sw4259A-ms98-a-0057 206.536750 208.127250 [silence]
sw4259A-ms98-a-0058 208.127250 210.608250 yeah [vocalized-noise]
sw4259A-ms98-a-0059 210.608250 212.326500 [silence]
sw4259A-ms98-a-0060 212.326500 214.840125 yeah that's true
sw4259A-ms98-a-0061 214.840125 223.444750 [silence]
sw4259A-ms98-a-0062 223.444750 230.105625 um-hum yeah and it's been a long time since i've seen any [vocalized-noise] you know source of the media do anything really gutsy 
sw4259A-ms98-a-0063 230.105625 235.554000 we had a situation here in Des Moines when um it was right after Jeffrey Dahlmer had been apprehended
sw4259A-ms98-a-0064 235.554000 241.010500 that um the animal rights groups ran an ad which [vocalized-noise] excepted
sw4259A-ms98-a-0065 241.010500 247.732000 which depicted the [vocalized-noise] of animals very much akin to the uh victims of Jeffrey Dahlmer
sw4259A-ms98-a-0066 247.732000 256.702625 well the register ran it which i think was the right role and privilege and i would be packing pulled out a quarter of a million in advertising
sw4259A-ms98-a-0067 256.702625 257.835250 [silence]
sw4259A-ms98-a-0068 257.835250 260.119500 you know socked it right to them_1
sw4259A-ms98-a-0069 260.119500 262.551000 and that's i guess uh
sw4259A-ms98-a-0070 262.551000 268.214750 something that distresses me when they have to cater to all these different special interest groups we're not going to get the news
sw4259A-ms98-a-0071 268.214750 271.256125 [silence]
sw4259A-ms98-a-0072 271.256125 272.636375 yeah
sw4259A-ms98-a-0073 272.636375 274.587875 [silence]
sw4259A-ms98-a-0074 274.587875 275.765250 well
sw4259A-ms98-a-0075 275.765250 279.188000 [silence]
sw4259A-ms98-a-0076 279.188000 281.608750 yeah and that's unfortunate
sw4259A-ms98-a-0077 281.608750 284.767750 [silence]
sw4259A-ms98-a-0078 284.767750 288.395500 yeah they they've got to work harder because right now
sw4259A-ms98-a-0079 288.395500 295.298000 when you challenge funding for public radio or public television you're no longer being typecast as trying to kill big bird
sw4259A-ms98-a-0080 295.298000 297.781500 you know they're uh
sw4259A-ms98-a-0081 297.781500 298.626000 i [vocalized-noise]
