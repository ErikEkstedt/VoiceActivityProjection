sw4280A-ms98-a-0019 117.541000 121.050625 yeah we're at a stage in our life where we don't have any kids
sw4280A-ms98-a-0020 121.050625 126.250625 yeah but we're approaching that point where we're going to have make a decision as far as
sw4280A-ms98-a-0021 126.250625 130.569750 does does my wife continue to work or do i continue to work to uh
sw4280A-ms98-a-0022 130.569750 139.567875 make ends meet and do you put chil[d]- child in day care some[where]- along that lines and the reality is that we'll probably have to have a child in day care
sw4280A-ms98-a-0023 139.567875 143.700875 and uh been thinking about how much that's going to cost it's uh
sw4280A-ms98-a-0024 143.700875 147.610500 rather frightening figure you really cuts into your income
sw4280A-ms98-a-0025 147.610500 149.008875 uh
sw4280A-ms98-a-0026 149.008875 150.199375 [silence]
sw4280A-ms98-a-0027 150.199375 157.917375 one of the things we have at our my company is uh day care reimbursement program we actually put money away into a tax free
sw4280A-ms98-a-0028 157.917375 159.566125 uh program
sw4280A-ms98-a-0029 159.566125 167.003250 um and they it's you're reimbursed out of that out of that funds provided it's used specifically and only for day care
sw4280A-ms98-a-0030 167.003250 171.537875 it's probably one of the few programs that i've seen uh that accomplished that
sw4280A-ms98-a-0031 171.537875 173.725625 i[t]- it helps out a little bit
sw4280A-ms98-a-0032 173.725625 175.454000 yeah
sw4280A-ms98-a-0033 175.454000 180.907375 but unfortunately i'm not you know able to tap into that until we have kids so that's down the road a little bit
sw4280A-ms98-a-0034 180.907375 183.965875 but i do have some brothers and sisters who are
sw4280A-ms98-a-0035 183.965875 187.386750 struggling a[s]- a[s]- as it is right now to make ends meet
sw4280A-ms98-a-0036 187.386750 190.358125 and they're also very uncomfortable with the idea of day cares
sw4280A-ms98-a-0037 190.358125 193.238375 but they're forced into that situation right now
sw4280A-ms98-a-0038 193.238375 209.351750 [silence]
sw4280A-ms98-a-0039 209.351750 210.708250 what's
sw4280A-ms98-a-0040 210.708250 223.230000 [silence]
sw4280A-ms98-a-0041 223.230000 226.396500 you know most people i know who have had to make that decision
sw4280A-ms98-a-0042 226.396500 233.485125 the spouse usually the the mother in situations that i can think of have been in tears they've dreaded the moment
sw4280A-ms98-a-0043 233.485125 238.562125 for throughout most of the pregnancy knowing that they'd have to eventually go back to work
sw4280A-ms98-a-0044 238.562125 242.434875 and uh when the time actually came to send your ch[ild]- ch[ild]- child to day care
sw4280A-ms98-a-0045 242.434875 243.845250 it was
sw4280A-ms98-a-0046 243.845250 245.761500 basically a very traumatic moment
sw4280A-ms98-a-0047 245.761500 247.935375 [silence]
sw4280A-ms98-a-0048 247.935375 251.988000 in my i see my wife nodding in the corner [laughter]
sw4280A-ms98-a-0049 251.988000 255.013875 as she dreads that date too i imagine
sw4280A-ms98-a-0050 255.013875 259.465375 but i[t]- uh unfortunately it is a reality you just can't get by without
sw4280A-ms98-a-0051 259.465375 262.183125 well very few people can get by without two incomes
sw4280A-ms98-a-0052 262.183125 263.724500 um
sw4280A-ms98-a-0053 263.724500 266.381500 least especially in the early stages of a career

sw4280A-ms98-a-0057 282.988750 289.509750 do you find any uh that there would be any benefits to a day care such as exposure to uh unlimited basis
sw4280A-ms98-a-0058 289.509750 292.193250 exposure to other kids um
sw4280A-ms98-a-0059 292.193250 294.516125 developing social interaction
