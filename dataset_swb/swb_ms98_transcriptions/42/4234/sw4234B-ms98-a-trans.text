sw4234B-ms98-a-0032 154.814750 167.061875 yeah i did too i- i- i one of the things gi[ven]- given my classical background uh one of the things that really turns me on is uh when the musicians are are creative with their instrumentation
sw4234B-ms98-a-0033 167.061875 176.318375 um as well as you know the typical creative lyrics or or or melodies i also like that's one of the reasons for example that i like Rush is because it's not always
sw4234B-ms98-a-0034 176.318375 184.910375 you know in two or in four even meter you know i[t]- they they they mix it up they they do interesting things with rhythms and they do interesting things with
sw4234B-ms98-a-0035 184.910375 188.585125 yeah and also um Getty Lee on the base
sw4234B-ms98-a-0036 188.585125 198.576375 um it's not -[ju]st a straight base line that just repeats over and over and over again like on the pop tunes it right i[t]- i[t]- i[t]- it it changes up
