sw4286A-ms98-a-0013 37.159750 50.680625 well i had an experience uh this summer as a ma[tter]- this past summer hm not this and what happened [laughter] was that my closet rod fell down
sw4286A-ms98-a-0014 50.680625 54.480625 [laughter] and i went into the closet
sw4286A-ms98-a-0015 54.480625 57.979125 and this closet is probably fifteen feet long
sw4286A-ms98-a-0016 57.979125 66.425250 and all my clothes were on the floor and i said oh my word [laughter] oh yes they're very heavy
sw4286A-ms98-a-0017 66.425250 68.179250 and um
sw4286A-ms98-a-0018 68.179250 75.998250 so i i thought now because_1 i'm alone and i said now who am i going to get to do [laughter-this] [laughter-because_1] i sure do[n't]- i wouldn't
sw4286A-ms98-a-0019 75.998250 83.024375 i know one end of the hammer from the other one [laughter-but] that's about it i wouldn't know how to address a nail properly at all 
sw4286A-ms98-a-0020 83.024375 88.579125 so i scoured the little paper that we get in the neighborhood and i found uh
sw4286A-ms98-a-0021 88.579125 99.312625 uh a handyman and he said that he was an ex-teacher and i thought well he sounds like the kind of caliber that i would not be too leery of and i called him and
sw4286A-ms98-a-0022 99.312625 109.430500 he did a marvelous job and i and i got to know him pretty well and i said uh he said Catherine he says if you
sw4286A-ms98-a-0023 109.430500 120.580625 this house will fall down but these c[loset]- [laughter-these] [laughter-close] [laughter-rods] [laughter-will] [laughter-not] [laughter-fall] [laughter-down] [laughter] he says that's how good they're in there he says i guarantee this for life [laughter]
sw4286A-ms98-a-0024 120.580625 129.502000 so that really pleased me and he did a m[arvelous]- he did a fantastic job and he also uh replaced my door in my garage uh
sw4286A-ms98-a-0025 129.502000 133.433625 i had been robbed uh the year before and um
sw4286A-ms98-a-0026 133.433625 142.562750 they wanted to charge me six hundred dollars to replace the side door and i thought no you're not i'm not paying six hundred dollars
sw4286A-ms98-a-0027 142.562750 144.633500 American money
sw4286A-ms98-a-0028 144.633500 148.951250 and Ken did it for me for like two hundred and thirty dollars
sw4286A-ms98-a-0029 148.951250 152.672375 and he ga[ve]- and he gave me a solid core door and
sw4286A-ms98-a-0030 152.672375 159.243125 you know i just said i knew that i would find somebody that would do this at a price that was realistic
sw4286A-ms98-a-0031 159.243125 169.535750 six hundred dollars for one single side door that's well he said well that's including labor and i thought okay Charlie i said that [laughter-sounds] [laughter-silly]

sw4286A-ms98-a-0036 177.789250 191.146875 yes it was well see they thought that they could prey on my uh recent loss that i would be in a panic to have this door fixed because that was the door that the intruders
sw4286A-ms98-a-0037 191.146875 201.151500 broke through but but the insurance company had made it so that nobody [laughter-could] [laughter-get] [laughter-in] because they put two by fours over it and nailed it shut

sw4286A-ms98-a-0040 204.899625 209.660750 if they wanted to get in they would have had to use a mac truck to get through the bars
sw4286A-ms98-a-0041 209.660750 214.258625 [silence]
sw4286A-ms98-a-0042 214.258625 222.306500 yeah well they you know the insurance adjuster said if if they are bent on getting your house they'll they'll they'll plow through your brick
