sw4264A-ms98-a-0008 28.711875 35.160250 uh my main problem is that um i i like to follow the national news
sw4264A-ms98-a-0009 35.160250 41.964000 so i'm i'm really not very happy with local news cast and i'm uh i don't like the local p[aper]- paper very much either
sw4264A-ms98-a-0010 41.964000 42.626500 [noise]
sw4264A-ms98-a-0011 42.626500 48.249875 especially since we don't have a choice anymore since Dallas lost its one paper that i
sw4264A-ms98-a-0012 48.249875 57.580375 um um i usually read the front page and then the editorial page and uh i'm finding that i spend less and less time on the editorial page because_1 the selection is so bad
sw4264A-ms98-a-0013 57.580375 59.330875 [silence]
sw4264A-ms98-a-0014 59.330875 61.838875 no uh i used to
sw4264A-ms98-a-0015 61.838875 71.181750 uh uh the New York Times is my favorite newspaper that's what i grew up with but uh i don't spend the money on it because i know i only get to spend five or ten minutes on it and have to
sw4264A-ms98-a-0016 71.181750 73.003375 uh let it pile up
sw4264A-ms98-a-0017 73.003375 75.526250 [silence]

sw4264A-ms98-a-0026 94.403375 100.297375 i wonder if they use their uh the same ones all the time or if they just grab uh the
sw4264A-ms98-a-0027 100.297375 106.759875 best of the Washington Post and the New York Times and they probably have a few syndicated columnists that they rotate

sw4264A-ms98-a-0030 113.377625 115.020375 they seem to s[elect]-
sw4264A-ms98-a-0031 115.020375 118.533625 select them kind of irregularly and i um
sw4264A-ms98-a-0032 118.533625 121.094500 i don't think they do a very good [laughter-job] [laughter-myself]
sw4264A-ms98-a-0033 121.094500 123.346500 [silence]
sw4264A-ms98-a-0034 123.346500 134.447000 pretty much i guess i like i said i read the headlines and then i read the editorial page and then i check the uh local news that's the only thing i really rely on the paper for is the local news
sw4264A-ms98-a-0035 134.447000 137.637375 but um i i'm finding that
sw4264A-ms98-a-0036 137.637375 138.334750 [noise]
sw4264A-ms98-a-0037 138.334750 139.914500 McNeal Lehrer

sw4264A-ms98-a-0039 143.705375 154.201625 i like to watch the most the[y]- because_1 they they don't give you these thirty seconds short shots of twenty different stories they usually spend about fifteen minutes or ten minutes on the story
sw4264A-ms98-a-0040 154.201625 155.493000 yeah
sw4264A-ms98-a-0041 155.493000 156.547500 [silence]

sw4264A-ms98-a-0070 242.047875 249.350250 most of the TV coverage is too short and superficial so that's one one reason you have to have a newspaper so you can read something in depth
