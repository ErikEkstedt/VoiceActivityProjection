sw4249A-ms98-a-0013 58.474500 64.483875 they have it there more i think and that's like the big town near us
sw4249A-ms98-a-0014 64.483875 66.205125 but um
sw4249A-ms98-a-0015 66.205125 67.234750 [silence]

sw4249A-ms98-a-0017 69.991500 76.473000 [silence]
sw4249A-ms98-a-0018 76.473000 78.918750 well sometimes i don't feel so bad
sw4249A-ms98-a-0019 78.918750 92.469750 i mean it's really i mean i[t]- this is really sad too because we have a big dumpster at our apartments and there's this little man that goes through our trash all the time to get the cans out
sw4249A-ms98-a-0020 92.469750 93.489750 [silence]
sw4249A-ms98-a-0021 93.489750 95.990875 i know

sw4249A-ms98-a-0024 111.729625 125.464750 [silence]
sw4249A-ms98-a-0025 125.464750 126.986500 uh-huh
sw4249A-ms98-a-0026 126.986500 127.997125 [silence]

sw4249A-ms98-a-0030 161.463125 165.270375 [silence]
sw4249A-ms98-a-0031 165.270375 170.698250 well i mean they do some but none of it's mandatory
sw4249A-ms98-a-0032 170.698250 174.739750 and like i said i live in an apartment complex
sw4249A-ms98-a-0033 174.739750 177.984125 and so they don't do it for us
sw4249A-ms98-a-0034 177.984125 182.981875 but some of the houses i've seen some of the bins around some of the houses
sw4249A-ms98-a-0035 182.981875 186.331125 [silence]
sw4249A-ms98-a-0036 186.331125 189.017625 there is a place
sw4249A-ms98-a-0037 189.017625 191.717625 but it's in Wilmington
sw4249A-ms98-a-0038 191.717625 204.243625 and so it's like a a big hassle you know to try to get everything together and i mean uh you'd have to save it up and have all that stuff lying around your apartment
sw4249A-ms98-a-0039 204.243625 206.495625 [silence]
sw4249A-ms98-a-0040 206.495625 209.998875 it's um about twenty minutes
sw4249A-ms98-a-0041 209.998875 212.294625 [silence]

sw4249A-ms98-a-0043 213.723000 215.507250 [silence]
sw4249A-ms98-a-0044 215.507250 222.247000 i know but i just think it's it must be hard to do in an apartment thing like this
sw4249A-ms98-a-0045 222.247000 224.304625 [silence]
sw4249A-ms98-a-0046 224.304625 225.995750 really

sw4249A-ms98-a-0050 259.443375 270.013875 yeah now see th[at]- i think that's why it's not as strict in the south it's because we still ha[ve]- have a lot of land left
sw4249A-ms98-a-0051 270.013875 278.477375 so i mean but i mean people do need to realize that that there's not always going to be land
sw4249A-ms98-a-0052 278.477375 282.221250 [silence]
sw4249A-ms98-a-0053 282.221250 283.765750 um-hum

sw4249A-ms98-a-0056 295.747625 298.722000 was in a voluntary program
