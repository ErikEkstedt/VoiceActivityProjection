sw4249B-ms98-a-0008 10.233375 16.283875 we have a lot of recycling in Rochester they do uh what they call curb side pick up
sw4249B-ms98-a-0009 16.283875 26.261375 and so they come by and they'll pick up uh the newspapers and cardboard and uh different colors of glass and uh
sw4249B-ms98-a-0010 26.261375 37.488250 see what else tin cans and uh plastic like you know your milk jugs and you know s[oap]- s[oap]- soap bottle uh jugs and all that type of stuff

sw4249B-ms98-a-0012 39.238000 43.995250 yeah so do they do any uh any sort of recycling back down where you are
sw4249B-ms98-a-0013 43.995250 50.703125 [silence]
sw4249B-ms98-a-0014 50.703125 52.772625 um-hum
sw4249B-ms98-a-0015 52.772625 54.485875 okay
sw4249B-ms98-a-0016 54.485875 63.000000 [silence]
sw4249B-ms98-a-0017 63.000000 64.763000 um-hum
sw4249B-ms98-a-0018 64.763000 69.219875 [silence]
sw4249B-ms98-a-0019 69.219875 72.253000 okay do uh
sw4249B-ms98-a-0020 72.253000 77.485750 i mean what do you think they ought to be doing down there in terms of doing more recycling and things like that
sw4249B-ms98-a-0021 77.485750 86.451750 [silence]
sw4249B-ms98-a-0022 86.451750 87.970375 um-hum
sw4249B-ms98-a-0023 87.970375 91.498750 [silence]
sw4249B-ms98-a-0024 91.498750 94.479750 oh wow that's really unfortunate
sw4249B-ms98-a-0025 94.479750 102.659500 well they do a whole lot of recycling here in Rochester i'm kind of hard pressed to say they ought to do more because i don't know what else they'd pick up i mean you know they
sw4249B-ms98-a-0026 102.659500 110.951875 they say things like you know they want all the little uh you know those little recycling symbols like the number ones and the number twos and all those things
sw4249B-ms98-a-0027 110.951875 119.495500 well they you know they say they'll pick up anything with number two but they guys who are uh picking it up are are kind of [vocalized-noise] i don't know i guess they aren't well trained
sw4249B-ms98-a-0028 119.495500 128.994500 because_1 like they s[ay]- they also say they won't pick up you know the you know like you buy a uh uh uh a six pack of pop and you know the plastic rings that they come in
sw4249B-ms98-a-0029 128.994500 141.460375 well nowadays those are coming with a little recycling symbol on them_1 you know with the number two but they won't pick it up because_1 they say well no we don't pick up that we only pick up you know like the milk jugs and soap jugs and stuff like that
sw4249B-ms98-a-0030 141.460375 145.463500 so i think they could be doing more if they here in Rochester
sw4249B-ms98-a-0031 145.463500 147.508125 if they just uh
sw4249B-ms98-a-0032 147.508125 157.498750 quit doing uh you know so much based on what the container is in terms on what used to have in it or something and if they did more on
sw4249B-ms98-a-0033 157.498750 159.995500 you know what the material is
sw4249B-ms98-a-0034 159.995500 160.989875 [silence]
sw4249B-ms98-a-0035 160.989875 165.987125 so uh i don't know so they don't do any recycling hardly at all down there
sw4249B-ms98-a-0036 165.987125 169.478375 [silence]

sw4249B-ms98-a-0052 206.776750 208.986750 [silence]
sw4249B-ms98-a-0053 208.986750 215.997000 oh wow so you'd have to get everything together and take it over there that'd be a real pain they ought to do the curb side stuff
sw4249B-ms98-a-0054 215.997000 220.225000 [silence]
sw4249B-ms98-a-0055 220.225000 232.594875 they do it here i mean they they have it here in Rochester in the apartments and people you know they have to do some special stuff but you know the apartment comple[x]- it's not the city see here in Rochester the city does it
sw4249B-ms98-a-0056 232.594875 238.539125 it would like i- i own my own house so the city comes by and they pick up you know
sw4249B-ms98-a-0057 238.539125 241.485375 the stuff on the same day they pick up the trash
sw4249B-ms98-a-0058 241.485375 247.474750 but for the apartments all the apartment places you know pay somebody to pick up all the trash
sw4249B-ms98-a-0059 247.474750 260.738000 and so the apartment pe[ople]- you know the the the waste disposal people have to come up with their own system but we passed a law here and they said you just got to do it there's no choice because all the you know all the landfills up here are full
sw4249B-ms98-a-0060 260.738000 264.478500 [silence]

sw4249B-ms98-a-0064 270.798625 273.265375 but that's going to change
sw4249B-ms98-a-0065 273.265375 274.990750 [silence]
sw4249B-ms98-a-0066 274.990750 276.280625 yeah

sw4249B-ms98-a-0068 277.496875 288.996000 yeah that's going to change at some point you know [vocalized-noise] a couple of years ago nobody around here talked about it and then one day everybody just kind of woke up and said gee you know [laughter-we're] [laughter-we're] in trouble and we got to fix this problem
sw4249B-ms98-a-0069 288.996000 291.992125 [silence]
