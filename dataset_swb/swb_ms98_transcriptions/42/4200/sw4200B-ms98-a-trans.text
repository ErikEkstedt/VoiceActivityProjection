sw4200B-ms98-a-0002 0.969000 3.465875 [silence]
sw4200B-ms98-a-0003 3.465875 12.294625 well i- i subscribe to two different newspapers the Gwinnete Daily News and the Journal so morning and afternoon and
sw4200B-ms98-a-0004 12.294625 25.000000 [noise] i guess that's where i get most of it and then i al[ways]- whenever i'm in the car i'm listening to WGST or WSB and uh read the news uh reports on the computer networks and uh
sw4200B-ms98-a-0005 25.000000 35.455375 uh i'm kind of addicted to Headline News and C-SPAN and CNN so i get it from everywhere i guess but most of the details from the newspapers
sw4200B-ms98-a-0006 35.455375 39.989750 [silence]
sw4200B-ms98-a-0007 39.989750 43.290000 yeah [laughter] um
sw4200B-ms98-a-0008 43.290000 50.470625 [silence]
sw4200B-ms98-a-0009 50.470625 59.998625 oh pretty much uh yeah i you know it in terms of the choice between the Journal and the Constitution i'd take the Journal because it carries more of the conservative columnists
sw4200B-ms98-a-0010 59.998625 62.993375 um and also
sw4200B-ms98-a-0011 62.993375 71.975250 didn't want to take two morning papers and sin[ce]- since i live in Gwinnete County i want to take the Daily News to get their Gwinnete coverage and it doesn't make sense to take two papers in the morning
sw4200B-ms98-a-0012 71.975250 85.980125 taking the journal in the afternoon means you're get some of the some of the news up until their deadline which is about eleven or eleven AM or noon uh which you wouldn't get uh until the next day with the Constitution
sw4200B-ms98-a-0013 85.980125 92.495125 [silence]
sw4200B-ms98-a-0014 92.495125 94.763625 well New York Times
sw4200B-ms98-a-0015 94.763625 96.797250 and uh so
sw4200B-ms98-a-0016 96.797250 97.199875 [noise]
sw4200B-ms98-a-0017 97.199875 111.494125 it's kind of strange they they're they're they're generally uh fairly conservative but some of the columnist they they publish are from the New York Times syndicate and from other newspapers owned by the New York Times
sw4200B-ms98-a-0018 111.494125 112.981625 so it's
sw4200B-ms98-a-0019 112.981625 116.009250 uh they tend to be really
sw4200B-ms98-a-0020 116.009250 118.490000 uh really liberal
sw4200B-ms98-a-0021 118.490000 131.817375 uh and i- i- i actually think probably uncharacteristic for Gwinnete County but it it's still interesting to hear or to to read uh you know different perspective on issues
sw4200B-ms98-a-0022 131.817375 139.496750 [silence]
sw4200B-ms98-a-0023 139.496750 152.756875 well i do keep up on current events in the high tech industry particularly data communications for my job but uh main reason i keep i keep up on current events is because of my interest in politics
sw4200B-ms98-a-0024 152.756875 157.240500 i'm you know active in politics and uh uh
sw4200B-ms98-a-0025 157.240500 158.267625 [silence]
sw4200B-ms98-a-0026 158.267625 165.989500 well i ran for State Representative in the election in nineteen ninety and running for probably going to run for State Labor Commission this year
sw4200B-ms98-a-0027 165.989500 168.731625 kind of ambitious but [laughter]
sw4200B-ms98-a-0028 168.731625 170.978000 [silence]
sw4200B-ms98-a-0029 170.978000 184.245125 well i um i- i was i run as a Libertarian and uh it was a three way race i got eight percent of the vote which is not bad for a third party in a three way race
sw4200B-ms98-a-0030 184.245125 188.465375 [silence]
sw4200B-ms98-a-0031 188.465375 194.721000 well i hope so the way [laughter] that's becoming pretty clear that the other two aren't doing that great of a job
sw4200B-ms98-a-0032 194.721000 195.983625 [silence]
sw4200B-ms98-a-0033 195.983625 198.488000 so where do you get your news
sw4200B-ms98-a-0034 198.488000 203.774875 [silence]
sw4200B-ms98-a-0035 203.774875 205.283750 uh-huh
sw4200B-ms98-a-0036 205.283750 213.489500 [silence]
sw4200B-ms98-a-0037 213.489500 214.975250 uh-huh
sw4200B-ms98-a-0038 214.975250 218.199125 [silence]
sw4200B-ms98-a-0039 218.199125 219.494250 yeah
sw4200B-ms98-a-0040 219.494250 222.748875 yeah i subscribe to several magazines too
sw4200B-ms98-a-0041 222.748875 228.981875 [silence]
sw4200B-ms98-a-0042 228.981875 230.219125 um-hum
sw4200B-ms98-a-0043 230.219125 232.994875 [silence]
sw4200B-ms98-a-0044 232.994875 238.363250 i subscribed to it at one time um but there was a period uh
sw4200B-ms98-a-0045 238.363250 248.498125 where i really felt that i was reading too much now now now i've got four kids and a fifth on the way now and it's hard to find time to read as much as i did
sw4200B-ms98-a-0046 248.498125 254.265625 so i've cut my monthly magazines back to just uh oh i guess three or four
sw4200B-ms98-a-0047 254.265625 268.999875 things like uh uh Reason which a lot of people don't even they don't even know what it is it's a it's a Libertarian magazine but it's uh has a lot to do with uh free markets and privatization and things of that nature
sw4200B-ms98-a-0048 268.999875 283.261750 and uh the Freeman which is another uh Libertarian uh more of a philosophical uh type journal rather than a uh news sort of thing
sw4200B-ms98-a-0049 283.261750 292.739000 and uh oh a couple of others but uh i don't tend t[o]- to subscribe to the the major news magazines or things like that 
sw4200B-ms98-a-0050 292.739000 295.498125 [silence]
sw4200B-ms98-a-0051 295.498125 297.954000 yeah i work for uh uh
