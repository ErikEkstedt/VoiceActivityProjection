sw4266B-ms98-a-0003 15.594875 17.796375 um-hum
sw4266B-ms98-a-0004 17.796375 19.209250 uh
sw4266B-ms98-a-0005 19.209250 25.907875 yeah that's an interesting point i work in uh the computer business which tends to be pretty
sw4266B-ms98-a-0006 25.907875 42.801250 high pressure and time consuming and i work with a lot of guys who are just now having first and second kids and it's interesting to see how they handle it because in a lot of cases they're still trying to put in the hours but they're also trying to spend a lot of time at home
sw4266B-ms98-a-0007 42.801250 52.154500 and in many cases they've got spouses who work so it's it's an interesting juggling pattern i
sw4266B-ms98-a-0008 52.154500 59.504875 my impression is that people try to uh to do both if they can as tough as that is
sw4266B-ms98-a-0009 59.504875 60.678500 [silence]
sw4266B-ms98-a-0010 60.678500 66.786750 uh boy that's a good question i've my kids are eight and a half and
sw4266B-ms98-a-0011 66.786750 79.798625 six now and i've been working in this business you know while they were growing up and you know it's [noise] it's tough uh there have been plenty of times where i've had to
sw4266B-ms98-a-0012 79.798625 85.891750 work long hours so that you know during a particular week i might not see them as much as i wanted to
sw4266B-ms98-a-0013 85.891750 96.522750 but i i do sense that people's expectations today are often different than they were maybe in my parent's generation where
sw4266B-ms98-a-0014 96.522750 99.574375 you know child raising was kind of seen as the
sw4266B-ms98-a-0015 99.574375 106.726125 the woman's responsibility and if the man had to work extra long hours or travel you know that's just the way it was i think
sw4266B-ms98-a-0016 106.726125 115.882875 today men have somewhat different expectations when they try to tailor their schedules as much as they can
sw4266B-ms98-a-0017 115.882875 141.868250 [silence]
sw4266B-ms98-a-0018 141.868250 143.251000 uh-huh

sw4266B-ms98-a-0023 161.446625 177.039875 [silence]
sw4266B-ms98-a-0024 177.039875 182.979625 yeah i think there's a lot to that you you really have to establish relationship early on 
sw4266B-ms98-a-0025 182.979625 191.355625 yeah certainly read a lot or heard a lot of stories about people who grow up saying i felt i never really knew my father
sw4266B-ms98-a-0026 191.355625 194.907625 and i you know it's it's hard to say i don't
sw4266B-ms98-a-0027 194.907625 202.700125 travel in a wide social circle but it's my impression that a lot of people today a lot of men are are trying to change uh anyway

sw4266B-ms98-a-0041 265.600500 270.788375 attached to mom and when i say i love you you know he says i hate you
sw4266B-ms98-a-0042 270.788375 280.588125 things like that not just kidding around not really meaning it but you know not as comfortable with uh an overt display of affection from me anyway [vocalized-noise]
