sw4266A-ms98-a-0002 1.143375 6.185500 it seems to me that most people rather make a decision between going all out
sw4266A-ms98-a-0003 6.185500 18.495875 particularly males go all out on the career or they go or they spend some real quality time with their kids when their when their kids are still young and and are willing to spend time with the parents what do you think about that
sw4266A-ms98-a-0004 18.495875 57.786625 [silence]
sw4266A-ms98-a-0005 57.786625 60.659000 do you think it's possible
sw4266A-ms98-a-0006 60.659000 85.141250 [silence]
sw4266A-ms98-a-0007 85.141250 86.393000 um-hum
sw4266A-ms98-a-0008 86.393000 114.305750 [silence]
sw4266A-ms98-a-0009 114.305750 120.261375 i got uh my office mate um he he got divorced and and uh
sw4266A-ms98-a-0010 120.261375 131.012625 he was talking about that the thing that he was gladdest about in in the relationship that he was in before that uh he spent like
sw4266A-ms98-a-0011 131.012625 142.650375 a lot more time than the average father with his kid i mean he took his kids out um ice skating and water skiing and and i mean just if there was something that that he could think of to do with them he went out and did it
sw4266A-ms98-a-0012 142.650375 151.535750 and now now that he's he's no longer the the wife has custody of the kids he still has a good relationship with the kids
sw4266A-ms98-a-0013 151.535750 160.299250 which you know a lot of people even in marriages that stay together try to all of the sudden get to know their kids when they turn eighteen or something like that
sw4266A-ms98-a-0014 160.299250 165.323375 but but i think i think he did the right thing is is making sure that the kids really
sw4266A-ms98-a-0015 165.323375 176.699375 i mean they might get mad as heck at at at the parents but making sure that the kids know from you know one two three that that there's no one that loves them_1 as much as uh as dad and mom

sw4266A-ms98-a-0020 201.903500 206.465375 i think it has been changing over the generations you know i see my granddad
sw4266A-ms98-a-0021 206.465375 218.954125 now and and it's really it's really way too late i- i mean my granddad grew up in the military you know he was always the never show your feelings but it seems like he tries real hard now to to try let his sons know that that he loves them and it's
sw4266A-ms98-a-0022 218.954125 221.060000 i mean to some extent it's too late
sw4266A-ms98-a-0023 221.060000 223.244500 my dad i'm sorry go ahead

sw4266A-ms98-a-0026 226.273500 231.573625 i always knew that my dad loved me he but he never really said it until uh
sw4266A-ms98-a-0027 231.573625 235.922000 oh i don't know i think i was in college the first time i actually heard him say it
sw4266A-ms98-a-0028 235.922000 241.025875 but uh i always knew it i mean he always he always did things so that i knew it
sw4266A-ms98-a-0029 241.025875 250.317125 but i think i- i mean granted it's easy to [laughter-say] i don't have kids but uh i- i- i think that's one of the things i really want to make sure that i do a lot is is say it
