sw4287B-ms98-a-0006 12.457750 17.989375 sometimes it seems of a bit of an invasion when i when i get calls from phone solicitors
sw4287B-ms98-a-0007 17.989375 24.558625 [silence]
sw4287B-ms98-a-0008 24.558625 31.006750 [laughter] well i get i've uh figured out someways creatively as to fight back with phone solicitors though

sw4287B-ms98-a-0010 33.171625 36.635625 i i've discovered it's kind of fun to try to
sw4287B-ms98-a-0011 36.635625 39.578750 take control of the conversation
sw4287B-ms98-a-0012 39.578750 42.766625 uh like you know typically
sw4287B-ms98-a-0013 42.766625 45.020000 they're reading from a script
sw4287B-ms98-a-0014 45.020000 47.962625 so if you start asking questions right away
sw4287B-ms98-a-0015 47.962625 52.648500 or do anything that's a little ou[t]- out of the ordinary they get really thrown
sw4287B-ms98-a-0016 52.648500 56.489250 so like often what i'll do is i'll call up and say
