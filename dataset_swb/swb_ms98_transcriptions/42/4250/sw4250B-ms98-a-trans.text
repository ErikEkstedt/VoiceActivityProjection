sw4250B-ms98-a-0024 77.807500 82.712375 my uh son went to Saint Thomas for uh a year and
sw4250B-ms98-a-0025 82.712375 89.171375 and uh we drove over and looked at Rice with the reason we thought there might some possibilities of of changing but
sw4250B-ms98-a-0026 89.171375 92.993750 anyway uh i was very impressed with the campus
sw4250B-ms98-a-0027 92.993750 98.263375 [silence]
sw4250B-ms98-a-0028 98.263375 104.728125 yeah uh my exercise program i u[sed]- i did run
sw4250B-ms98-a-0029 104.728125 109.700875 uh for several reasons i now do mostly walking
sw4250B-ms98-a-0030 109.700875 112.988500 uh one was that i had a knee injury i stepped in a
sw4250B-ms98-a-0031 112.988500 118.455125 in a crack or a whole twisted my knee and it was very painful
sw4250B-ms98-a-0032 118.455125 123.724625 and the other is i'm getting older now so it makes more sense to walk than it does to run
