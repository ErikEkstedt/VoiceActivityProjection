sw4250A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.018250 [silence]
sw4250A-ms98-a-0002 0.018250 10.005375 i run uh usually a couple of times a week um because_1 i i'm at i'm a student at Rice University and so i can just sort of run a loop around the campus which is about three miles
sw4250A-ms98-a-0003 10.005375 22.019375 and um that's sort of i guess it's probably the most common thing i do for exercise the other thing i do is um i try and play racquetball a couple of times a week with um a friend
sw4250A-ms98-a-0004 22.019375 23.971750 [silence]
sw4250A-ms98-a-0005 23.971750 35.495750 uh yeah actually if i do it uh certainly at night i fee[l]- i mean sorry not at night i feel perfectly safe at night i usually do it with someone else uh 
sw4250A-ms98-a-0006 35.495750 38.994375 [silence]
sw4250A-ms98-a-0007 38.994375 47.996125 well let's see um north is sort of the meandrous area which is not uh it's not too bad as far as crime goes i think i mean it's not really great
sw4250A-ms98-a-0008 47.996125 54.714250 um south is the area that's really crime ridden that's sort of the south main area um
sw4250A-ms98-a-0009 54.714250 66.688125 yeah so that that's not too great but the um i usually feel pretty safe around the campus itself uh the uh Rice has their own police department and they're pretty aggressive about
sw4250A-ms98-a-0010 66.688125 68.226500 [silence]
sw4250A-ms98-a-0011 68.226500 73.478500 no actually we don't we don't have fences it's just uh a tall hedge so
sw4250A-ms98-a-0012 73.478500 79.239875 but uh yeah it does [vocalized-noise] yeah at least it's a psychological barrier so
sw4250A-ms98-a-0013 79.239875 92.425375 [silence]
sw4250A-ms98-a-0014 92.425375 100.460750 yeah it's really it's a pretty a beautiful campus especially considering it's in the [laughter-middle] of [laughter-the] ugly city like [laughter-Houston] but uh
sw4250A-ms98-a-0015 100.460750 113.997625 [silence]
sw4250A-ms98-a-0016 113.997625 115.987875 hm
sw4250A-ms98-a-0017 115.987875 117.079375 yeah
sw4250A-ms98-a-0018 117.079375 122.251875 [silence]
sw4250A-ms98-a-0019 122.251875 125.284125 yeah i can um
sw4250A-ms98-a-0020 125.284125 138.496750 one of the reasons i run uh probably the biggest reason either run or play racquetball i mean either of them is um because_1 if i don't get exercise i don't i don't sleep well and i just don't feel as good i just feel kind of yucky
sw4250A-ms98-a-0021 138.496750 141.753375 [silence]
sw4250A-ms98-a-0022 141.753375 142.995750 yeah
sw4250A-ms98-a-0023 142.995750 143.987625 [silence]
sw4250A-ms98-a-0024 143.987625 146.747375 yeah that too i mean uh the um
sw4250A-ms98-a-0025 146.747375 159.192875 but the reason why i noticed you were talking about walking i i don't if i walk i'd have to walk like ten [laughter-miles] [laughter-i] [laughter-think] [laughter-to] you know for it to really sort of get the same benefit as running if i run uh really hard
sw4250A-ms98-a-0026 159.192875 167.682875 and that that may just be that may just be me or you know whatever i'm sure i'm sure when i get older i'll [laughter-probably] i'll be more of a workout but
sw4250A-ms98-a-0027 167.682875 169.233250 [silence]
sw4250A-ms98-a-0028 169.233250 171.269750 that's pretty good yeah
sw4250A-ms98-a-0029 171.269750 174.981125 [silence]
sw4250A-ms98-a-0030 174.981125 176.304625 yeah
sw4250A-ms98-a-0031 176.304625 191.310125 [silence]
sw4250A-ms98-a-0032 191.310125 195.999375 wow that that that's a fair amount that's more than i do by a considerable amount
sw4250A-ms98-a-0033 195.999375 200.479375 [silence]
sw4250A-ms98-a-0034 200.479375 201.798500 yeah
sw4250A-ms98-a-0035 201.798500 204.995125 [silence]
sw4250A-ms98-a-0036 204.995125 215.785625 yeah yeah no i understand that i mean i i sometimes you know feel like uh well one reason a[nother]- another reason why i run rather than do something like walk is uh it takes a [laughter-long] [laughter-time]
sw4250A-ms98-a-0037 215.785625 228.985250 because it's sort of the same work out but but yeah i can [vocalized-noise] i sort of you know am able to you know sleep better and and be more uh more alert um when i'm you know when i am awake if i if i exercise regularly so it really
sw4250A-ms98-a-0038 228.985250 231.497375 it's kind of like an investment that pays off
sw4250A-ms98-a-0039 231.497375 233.773375 [silence]
sw4250A-ms98-a-0040 233.773375 248.637500 well i mean it's kind of it's it's you know it's good exercise especially when you get good at it because you the idea is to make the other player run to where he's [laughter-not] i mean you hit the ball it's kind of like tennis in that sense but you're not ch[asing]- always chasing after the ball um
sw4250A-ms98-a-0041 248.637500 261.497250 but uh the reason why i do like that a little bit better than running if i can find uh you know people to play with because it's more it's more interesting i mean there's you know like a game aspect to it as well as just sort of the exercise
sw4250A-ms98-a-0042 261.497250 262.745250 [silence]
sw4250A-ms98-a-0043 262.745250 263.993250 [noise]
sw4250A-ms98-a-0044 263.993250 265.764750 yeah oh yeah
sw4250A-ms98-a-0045 265.764750 266.994500 [silence]
sw4250A-ms98-a-0046 266.994500 279.493750 yeah yeah and it took a li[ttle]- it took a little while to to get good i mean the first you know i don't know two or three weeks of playing uh you know t[o]- i didn't really get that great of work out but but i[t]- now i it's pretty good
sw4250A-ms98-a-0047 279.493750 288.961000 [silence]
sw4250A-ms98-a-0048 288.961000 300.162000 yeah i can i can understand knee problems because_1 i've found i haven't had trouble with it this year but in past years when i've you know done only running and not racquetball um my
