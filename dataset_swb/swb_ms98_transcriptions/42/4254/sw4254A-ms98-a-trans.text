sw4254A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.997125 [noise]
sw4254A-ms98-a-0002 0.997125 4.503750 [vocalized-noise] i guess that was it um
sw4254A-ms98-a-0003 4.503750 9.696750 i guess the uh it's interesting that they asked the benefits question i think because uh
sw4254A-ms98-a-0004 9.696750 16.249250 we just merged with another um division in our company and actually have different slightly different benefits
sw4254A-ms98-a-0005 16.249250 21.514250 so i guess the the things i'd look for um kind of things i call like safety net
sw4254A-ms98-a-0006 21.514250 25.305625 features like health insurance and uh possibly
sw4254A-ms98-a-0007 25.305625 30.284875 um retirement pension sorts of incentives
sw4254A-ms98-a-0008 30.284875 38.755375 and then i guess there's the things for like personal growth like uh educational reimb[ursement]- tui[tion]- like tuition reimbursement or uh
sw4254A-ms98-a-0009 38.755375 40.467875 um
sw4254A-ms98-a-0010 40.467875 46.995625 maybe uh money used for some kind of wellness program like to join a fitness center or something like that would be
sw4254A-ms98-a-0011 46.995625 48.957875 [vocalized-noise] be interested in seeing

sw4254A-ms98-a-0017 79.693375 85.986625 that's interesting yeah i- i was actually at uh Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh doing uh
sw4254A-ms98-a-0018 85.986625 87.001000 [silence]
sw4254A-ms98-a-0019 87.001000 90.998750 um i guess on research staff there and i i got a feeling that uh
sw4254A-ms98-a-0020 90.998750 97.717875 you know there wasn't really it wasn't really designed to provide real opportunities for advancement unless you happen to you know like [vocalized-noise]
sw4254A-ms98-a-0021 97.717875 100.276875 a doctorate in something and then you could

sw4254A-ms98-a-0025 105.814000 107.493125 you know the uh
sw4254A-ms98-a-0026 107.493125 109.985875 more important position than
sw4254A-ms98-a-0027 109.985875 111.267625 [silence]
sw4254A-ms98-a-0028 111.267625 112.495375 yeah
sw4254A-ms98-a-0029 112.495375 118.999125 well no i'm not i'm sorry i'm at uh i'm actually doing um consulting in the commercial
sw4254A-ms98-a-0030 118.999125 121.237750 in in industry
sw4254A-ms98-a-0031 121.237750 128.299625 [silence]

sw4254A-ms98-a-0033 129.718000 134.981125 [silence]
sw4254A-ms98-a-0034 134.981125 136.995000 well that's interesting
sw4254A-ms98-a-0035 136.995000 141.484875 [silence]
sw4254A-ms98-a-0036 141.484875 144.481000 yeah but it seems like other uh
sw4254A-ms98-a-0037 144.481000 151.472375 the other people that are on the verge or already have missiles that those kinds of systems would be good at uh you know early detection
sw4254A-ms98-a-0038 151.472375 152.982500 or
sw4254A-ms98-a-0039 152.982500 158.481875 [silence]
sw4254A-ms98-a-0040 158.481875 162.008875 oh okay so it's not viewed as
sw4254A-ms98-a-0041 162.008875 163.232125 that's interesting
sw4254A-ms98-a-0042 163.232125 169.474625 [silence]
sw4254A-ms98-a-0043 169.474625 174.483625 um actually i never thought of that i- i- i- i guess i assumed that's part of the uh
sw4254A-ms98-a-0044 174.483625 176.980625 package but um
sw4254A-ms98-a-0045 176.980625 184.222125 i guess if the salary was you know enough then i might just make my own you know take the unpaid time off but uh
sw4254A-ms98-a-0046 184.222125 187.960875 um as long as you know it's not uh
sw4254A-ms98-a-0047 187.960875 199.308875 i g[uess]- what's more important than vacation is actually having the time to use it because_1 a lot of times we're in projects whe[re]- you know where the dates are critical and it's it's a little harder to plan a vacation
sw4254A-ms98-a-0048 199.308875 201.466250 when you're in that kind of environment
sw4254A-ms98-a-0049 201.466250 205.485375 [silence]
