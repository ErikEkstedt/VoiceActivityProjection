sw4209B-ms98-a-0003 2.576750 11.005625 i certainly think that in some cases i am but uh i think it's mostly on the federal area were i don't see as much
sw4209B-ms98-a-0004 11.005625 16.243125 maybe fo[r]- for my money as uh i might uh i thought of
sw4209B-ms98-a-0005 16.243125 30.636375 school taxes as well and i was very involved in schools uh in the local community a couple years ago and it was pretty easy to see where it went all there but i guess i have the same opinion that some American have that uh uh it's all fat [laughter]
sw4209B-ms98-a-0006 30.636375 32.601625 how about you

sw4209B-ms98-a-0014 63.781375 65.893500 yeah that that adds up
sw4209B-ms98-a-0015 65.893500 71.179000 [silence]
sw4209B-ms98-a-0016 71.179000 72.201500 uh-huh
sw4209B-ms98-a-0017 72.201500 73.901750 [silence]
sw4209B-ms98-a-0018 73.901750 76.875875 it certainly adds up quickly yes
sw4209B-ms98-a-0019 76.875875 87.911250 and i've heard it said that of course that effect that effect us across the board in terms of social economic uh areas everybody pays that sale tax
sw4209B-ms98-a-0020 87.911250 93.494375 um i guess that's i- i guess i'm luck here i only pay five percent
sw4209B-ms98-a-0021 93.494375 94.750500 and
sw4209B-ms98-a-0022 94.750500 103.387125 [laughter] well if you want to move here uh all you have to do is find a job so i guess you trade things off one way or another [laughter]
sw4209B-ms98-a-0023 103.387125 105.412375 [laughter]
sw4209B-ms98-a-0024 105.412375 117.830000 [silence]
sw4209B-ms98-a-0025 117.830000 119.424750 um-hum
sw4209B-ms98-a-0026 119.424750 120.668000 [silence]
sw4209B-ms98-a-0027 120.668000 122.300250 cool
sw4209B-ms98-a-0028 122.300250 127.024000 [silence]
sw4209B-ms98-a-0029 127.024000 130.575000 exactly they uh [laughter]
sw4209B-ms98-a-0030 130.575000 131.872125 [silence]
sw4209B-ms98-a-0031 131.872125 133.219250 [laughter]
sw4209B-ms98-a-0032 133.219250 143.434500 [silence]
sw4209B-ms98-a-0033 143.434500 148.842125 i would think so uh that sort of thing has been tried here and
sw4209B-ms98-a-0034 148.842125 160.682125 the results are results the results were not too hardening uh and the belief here is uh kind of education what do we need that for [laughter]
sw4209B-ms98-a-0035 160.682125 172.146125 [silence]
sw4209B-ms98-a-0036 172.146125 173.285625 yeah
sw4209B-ms98-a-0037 173.285625 177.720625 [silence]
sw4209B-ms98-a-0038 177.720625 191.744750 exactly uh and i would think base upon my experience you have to have some of that uh consider uh some of these places in Idaho that have a school district of a total of about two hundred or three hundred children
sw4209B-ms98-a-0039 191.744750 204.285250 and there a certain amount of overhead in running a school district uh for instance those kids may be spread out uh over an area where driving the buses you may go forty or fifty or even sixty miles
sw4209B-ms98-a-0040 204.285250 205.848625 and
sw4209B-ms98-a-0041 205.848625 220.678000 can you really expect the uh the people in that district to support all that overhead of getting the kids to and from school so some of the money come through the states from all people in the state basically e[qual]- well base upon their income
sw4209B-ms98-a-0042 220.678000 227.018625 to i'm sorry i- i take i that back a little bit of it comes from their income uh
sw4209B-ms98-a-0043 227.018625 239.092875 to support doing thing like that and that's probably okay uh it's kind of like telephone where uh the folk that live in the middle of town subsidize for people that have lines that go out for four or five miles
sw4209B-ms98-a-0044 239.092875 247.841500 uh the other thing that we have is a property tax and that tend to subsidies part of it also
sw4209B-ms98-a-0045 247.841500 259.260750 uh the disadvantage there of course the people get into is they say hey i don't have any kids in school i've been retried for thirty five years and i'm still paying for somebody education
sw4209B-ms98-a-0046 259.260750 270.390125 i- i guess i'm a believe in yes you have to you have to have some overhead just like uh i never used the fire department but at the some time i'll hate to have to ante up before they got here
sw4209B-ms98-a-0047 270.390125 273.017000 [laughter]
sw4209B-ms98-a-0048 273.017000 274.485250 [silence]
sw4209B-ms98-a-0049 274.485250 281.500875 yes yes yes we still pay that i suspect it's not quite a higher percentage as you may pay
sw4209B-ms98-a-0050 281.500875 284.687875 [silence]
sw4209B-ms98-a-0051 284.687875 287.049375 well [laughter]
sw4209B-ms98-a-0052 287.049375 289.347250 [laughter]
sw4209B-ms98-a-0053 289.347250 290.526875 yeah
sw4209B-ms98-a-0054 290.526875 291.733000 [silence]
sw4209B-ms98-a-0055 291.733000 293.376125 i i certainly
sw4209B-ms98-a-0056 293.376125 295.512625 [silence]
sw4209B-ms98-a-0057 295.512625 297.037250 that's true
