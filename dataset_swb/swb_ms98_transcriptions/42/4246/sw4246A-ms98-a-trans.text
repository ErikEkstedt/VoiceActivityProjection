sw4246A-ms98-a-0002 0.355750 2.097000 so what do you think about space flying
sw4246A-ms98-a-0003 2.097000 5.501750 [silence]
sw4246A-ms98-a-0004 5.501750 6.593000 oh yeah

sw4246A-ms98-a-0008 21.963625 25.220625 yeah i i i have read a couple articles on it yeah
sw4246A-ms98-a-0009 25.220625 28.577625 [silence]
sw4246A-ms98-a-0010 28.577625 29.939375 oh okay

sw4246A-ms98-a-0016 43.607875 46.412375 so basically would they uh
sw4246A-ms98-a-0017 46.412375 55.238625 would they essentially in terms of mag[netism]- magnetism would they go like reverse polarity there so you'd actually get pushed along or would it be actually a draw
sw4246A-ms98-a-0018 55.238625 59.477125 [silence]
sw4246A-ms98-a-0019 59.477125 61.026250 oh interesting

sw4246A-ms98-a-0029 91.756625 93.509500 oh that's pretty interesting
sw4246A-ms98-a-0030 93.509500 105.010375 yeah yeah personally i think that uh we don't spend enough on space exploration and i think we probably should spend more just because it you know it it not only benefits uh
sw4246A-ms98-a-0031 105.010375 112.173750 space per se but it also benefits technology you know you start to develop things specifically for space use
sw4246A-ms98-a-0032 112.173750 117.814625 and you know the offspring technologies can benefit a whole lot of different aspects of society
sw4246A-ms98-a-0033 117.814625 119.027875 so that's
sw4246A-ms98-a-0034 119.027875 124.033250 [silence]
sw4246A-ms98-a-0035 124.033250 124.814625 yeah

sw4246A-ms98-a-0037 137.628000 139.717250 sure
sw4246A-ms98-a-0038 139.717250 140.662750 yeah it's it
sw4246A-ms98-a-0039 140.662750 147.674875 [silence]
sw4246A-ms98-a-0040 147.674875 148.846875 [laughter]
sw4246A-ms98-a-0041 148.846875 153.326750 yeah that's kind of that's kind of hard to defend in some ways but
sw4246A-ms98-a-0042 153.326750 155.523125 you know also you got to consider that
sw4246A-ms98-a-0043 155.523125 156.758125 it's
sw4246A-ms98-a-0044 156.758125 161.754625 this space exploration could give us a lot of different view points o[n]- on current problems
sw4246A-ms98-a-0045 161.754625 164.744125 um primary of which in my mind right now is
sw4246A-ms98-a-0046 164.744125 167.343875 uh the whole thing with uh
sw4246A-ms98-a-0047 167.343875 169.656625 the depleting o[zone]- ozone layer
sw4246A-ms98-a-0048 169.656625 180.506750 you know i was reading an article about that the other day and it's a[mazing]- really amazing how much we're losing uh how much of the ozone layer's really disappearing there's an article in Time magazine about it but
sw4246A-ms98-a-0049 180.506750 190.159250 you know things like that can be very well uh studied from space you know and using satellites and space technology and things like that
sw4246A-ms98-a-0050 190.159250 200.413250 uh i think that's real important and if we if we don't look at that closely we could be really screwing ourselves uh
sw4246A-ms98-a-0051 200.413250 208.014375 i don't know it's it's it's an it's an interesting thing because_1 it's like you said some of the positions seem untenable at least when you're trying to defend them_1
sw4246A-ms98-a-0052 208.014375 215.930500 in in congress and things like that people tend not to have a very long term view like to look at more uh
sw4246A-ms98-a-0053 215.930500 221.296875 more short term problems which you know they're logical and they're
sw4246A-ms98-a-0054 221.296875 226.490375 and they're very prevalent you know things like world hunger yeah that's a big uh that's a big problem
sw4246A-ms98-a-0055 226.490375 227.587750 um
sw4246A-ms98-a-0056 227.587750 229.862625 but you've got to have a long term view as well
sw4246A-ms98-a-0057 229.862625 234.689000 [silence]
sw4246A-ms98-a-0058 234.689000 236.925500 yeah yes exactly
sw4246A-ms98-a-0059 236.925500 243.522625 most people will will try to to solve the symptoms without really looking at the uh the problem itself
sw4246A-ms98-a-0060 243.522625 250.378875 [silence]
sw4246A-ms98-a-0061 250.378875 251.513625 um-hum
