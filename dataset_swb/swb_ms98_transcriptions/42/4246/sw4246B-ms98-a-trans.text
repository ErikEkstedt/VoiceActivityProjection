sw4246B-ms98-a-0003 1.703875 15.222625 uh well uh i was just reading something on it as a matter of fact uh just got uh latest copy of uh Analog magazine and it had an article in it on uh uh a new
sw4246B-ms98-a-0004 15.222625 22.417000 a new version of propulsion that they're looking at um are you familiar with uh the solar sail idea
sw4246B-ms98-a-0005 22.417000 25.135000 [silence]
sw4246B-ms98-a-0006 25.135000 29.477000 uh well this is apparently what they call a magnetic sail
sw4246B-ms98-a-0007 29.477000 44.044875 um basically they just uh set up a large uh magnetic field and uh it's works a lot like sailing on the ocean uh and is a lot more flexible than using solar sails
sw4246B-ms98-a-0008 44.044875 55.144500 [silence]
sw4246B-ms98-a-0009 55.144500 60.414625 um that's the thing about it is you can switch it depending on the circumstance
sw4246B-ms98-a-0010 60.414625 75.159000 um and it also works uh you can use it to uh pull yourself out of like a low earth orbit uh by using the earth's magnetic field and moving from there and it also acts like um
sw4246B-ms98-a-0011 75.159000 76.485625 [silence]
sw4246B-ms98-a-0012 76.485625 78.376875 like a uh uh
sw4246B-ms98-a-0013 78.376875 86.216250 uh i don't know it's called it's a it's a shield against uh radiation and and flare and that sort of thing because_1 it builds up um
sw4246B-ms98-a-0014 86.216250 93.930250 it builds out a a magnetic barrier around it uh kind of like the earth's magnetoshpere and uh protects the people that way yeah
sw4246B-ms98-a-0015 93.930250 100.848250 [silence]
sw4246B-ms98-a-0016 100.848250 102.285125 yeah

sw4246B-ms98-a-0018 118.622375 127.651125 it's that and you also have the benefit of the things that you just don't know about yet i mean the biggest the biggest uh thing that comes from
sw4246B-ms98-a-0019 127.651125 141.422875 space exploration i think is not uh those developments we make in order to accomplish it but those things that we discover that we have no idea we're going to discover it's it's all the surprises the problem with that is you can't
sw4246B-ms98-a-0020 141.422875 149.697000 preach that as as a political statement you know in front of congress saying we should fund it because we don't know what we're going to discover

sw4246B-ms98-a-0026 229.902500 238.528000 yeah the problems with things like world hunger are that throwing money at it doesn't make it go away it just it ju[st]- it stop gap um
sw4246B-ms98-a-0027 238.528000 243.125750 [silence]
sw4246B-ms98-a-0028 243.125750 255.532000 yeah with space exploration it's a lot like um like trying to jump into a new industry you've got huge start up costs uh lot bigger in this case than in most others but once you're established there
sw4246B-ms98-a-0029 255.532000 262.767750 i think it would you know i think it's obvious to everyone that it would be highly profitable uh once you've reached a certain level it just takes
sw4246B-ms98-a-0030 262.767750 275.428750 that rather substantial long term commitment you know for a for a number of years or or even several decades in order to to get it up to the standard where you need it uh in order to go from there um
sw4246B-ms98-a-0031 275.428750 284.202250 where do i work um i used to be uh an auditor uh for one of the big six accounting firms i'm currently uh
