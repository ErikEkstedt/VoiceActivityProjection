sw4274B-ms98-a-0004 15.079250 23.611000 in the case where there's a problem that you know the person's performance is bad or where they have uh you know they suspect something wrong with the person
sw4274B-ms98-a-0005 23.611000 30.294875 but in a case where there's no problem and nothing suspected what does the random testing do
sw4274B-ms98-a-0006 30.294875 41.641875 especially since they're only testing for certain things they're not testing for other things uh that could be impairing your ability to perform the job

sw4274B-ms98-a-0024 182.511250 187.632250 yeah now i think that's more related to other stresses outside
sw4274B-ms98-a-0025 187.632250 201.771000 you know if you get into a period where you're very very stressed on your job or very very stressed in your life then you're going to be you know if you have the predisposition then you can turn and your habit goes up and that's very true of alcoholism
