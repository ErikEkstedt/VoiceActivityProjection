sw4205B-ms98-a-0004 5.984000 7.117750 [silence]
sw4205B-ms98-a-0005 7.117750 9.061250 was justified
sw4205B-ms98-a-0006 9.061250 11.240000 but it was carried out badly
sw4205B-ms98-a-0007 11.240000 14.015375 unfortunately politician got a hold of it
sw4205B-ms98-a-0008 14.015375 17.338250 and it was a military victory but it was uh
sw4205B-ms98-a-0009 17.338250 21.282375 i'd say uh a political defeat
sw4205B-ms98-a-0010 21.282375 25.019000 wh[at]- wh[at]- what do you think about of world i mean the Vietnam War
sw4205B-ms98-a-0011 25.019000 49.247250 [silence]
sw4205B-ms98-a-0012 49.247250 52.554500 [noise] no uh from what i remember was uh
sw4205B-ms98-a-0013 52.554500 54.013500 the French
sw4205B-ms98-a-0014 54.013500 56.869375 had a Vietnam as a colony
sw4205B-ms98-a-0015 56.869375 59.725250 and then after the war World War II
sw4205B-ms98-a-0016 59.725250 60.716125 uh
sw4205B-ms98-a-0017 60.716125 64.088125 Vietnam wanted to become independent o[f]- of France
sw4205B-ms98-a-0018 64.088125 66.625125 so they started an up rising and that was the French
sw4205B-ms98-a-0019 66.625125 68.943250 and oh Chinese War
sw4205B-ms98-a-0020 68.943250 71.579250 and and uh basically
sw4205B-ms98-a-0021 71.579250 78.423625 V[ietnamese]- Vietnamese where beating the French so we took over because_1 we had our containment policy
sw4205B-ms98-a-0022 78.423625 81.451625 and uh the north side of Vietnam
sw4205B-ms98-a-0023 81.451625 84.016000 went to Russia for military aid
sw4205B-ms98-a-0024 84.016000 85.452250 and so [noise] we didn't want
sw4205B-ms98-a-0025 85.452250 87.022500 [silence]
sw4205B-ms98-a-0026 87.022500 91.134875 so we didn't want [noise] Vietnam [noise] become communist 
sw4205B-ms98-a-0027 91.134875 95.838125 so that's why we started supporting the South Viet[namese]- Vietnamese that's how the war started
sw4205B-ms98-a-0028 95.838125 100.095750 [silence]
sw4205B-ms98-a-0029 100.095750 102.252125 uh
sw4205B-ms98-a-0030 102.252125 108.579000 [silence]
sw4205B-ms98-a-0031 108.579000 115.803375 but it's not necessarily oil i- i- i know you are talking about like uh natural resources but i don't think they had that much of a natural
sw4205B-ms98-a-0032 115.803375 123.038000 to much natural resource it's just like i said our we had a containment policy and if we didn't help the South Vietnamese
sw4205B-ms98-a-0033 123.038000 129.901875 the North Vietnamese would have definitely won and then our views in those days they would have become communist or pinko
sw4205B-ms98-a-0034 129.901875 132.896625 so we didn't want that so we got into the war
sw4205B-ms98-a-0035 132.896625 146.739125 [silence]
sw4205B-ms98-a-0036 146.739125 147.951625 uh-huh

sw4205B-ms98-a-0038 156.634625 158.253500 uh [noise]
sw4205B-ms98-a-0039 158.253500 159.439375 [silence]
sw4205B-ms98-a-0040 159.439375 162.293250 actually i- i- i really haven't considered that much
sw4205B-ms98-a-0041 162.293250 164.375375 about a strategic location
sw4205B-ms98-a-0042 164.375375 166.069875 [silence]
sw4205B-ms98-a-0043 166.069875 167.645625 hum uh
sw4205B-ms98-a-0044 167.645625 169.038625 [silence]
sw4205B-ms98-a-0045 169.038625 172.041000 other than it being another country falling to the
sw4205B-ms98-a-0046 172.041000 173.836375 to pinkos or the communist
sw4205B-ms98-a-0047 173.836375 174.957875 [silence]
sw4205B-ms98-a-0048 174.957875 176.953375 no not to much real strategic
sw4205B-ms98-a-0049 176.953375 178.246375 location
sw4205B-ms98-a-0050 178.246375 179.756375 it's just
sw4205B-ms98-a-0051 179.756375 187.494750 uh for for Russia to continue it has to expand if it doesn't expand it'll collapse
sw4205B-ms98-a-0052 187.494750 190.327875 so by doing our containment policy
sw4205B-ms98-a-0053 190.327875 192.318250 we're defeating
sw4205B-ms98-a-0054 192.318250 193.375625 Russia
sw4205B-ms98-a-0055 193.375625 194.660750 [silence]
sw4205B-ms98-a-0056 194.660750 200.183000 i don't know if uh if that containment policy was was right or the best
sw4205B-ms98-a-0057 200.183000 201.306750 but
sw4205B-ms98-a-0058 201.306750 203.933875 that was our our little view then
sw4205B-ms98-a-0059 203.933875 229.415750 [silence]
sw4205B-ms98-a-0060 229.415750 231.366500 uh
sw4205B-ms98-a-0061 231.366500 232.664750 [silence]
sw4205B-ms98-a-0062 232.664750 236.694625 i- i- i agree partial with you the Vietnam War made us loose
sw4205B-ms98-a-0063 236.694625 239.671625 loose faith uh politically
sw4205B-ms98-a-0064 239.671625 243.010000 and and th[at]- and and to the fact that the American public
sw4205B-ms98-a-0065 243.010000 245.438750 can't stomach war or high causality
sw4205B-ms98-a-0066 245.438750 253.019125 so we aren't really steadfast in that regard but military we un[questionably]- you know unquestionably quick ass in Vietnam
sw4205B-ms98-a-0067 253.019125 254.007750 [silence]
sw4205B-ms98-a-0068 254.007750 254.991875 uh

sw4205B-ms98-a-0070 256.244875 257.959250 [noise] it might have had
sw4205B-ms98-a-0071 257.959250 262.492625 probably did have some re[percussions]- repercussions towards now you know people do
sw4205B-ms98-a-0072 262.492625 263.590125 [silence]
sw4205B-ms98-a-0073 263.590125 267.751500 the enemy does know if the America takes high causality it will leave
sw4205B-ms98-a-0074 267.751500 269.468375 just like in uh
sw4205B-ms98-a-0075 269.468375 270.841375 [silence]
sw4205B-ms98-a-0076 270.841375 276.753625 uh that uh a car bombing or three hundred marines were killed and we just got the hell out
sw4205B-ms98-a-0077 276.753625 292.895125 [silence]
sw4205B-ms98-a-0078 292.895125 296.531375 uh what what is uh low causality or high causalities
