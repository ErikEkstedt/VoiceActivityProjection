sw3660B-ms98-a-0029 146.763500 149.872375 so your big beef with it is the uh
sw3660B-ms98-a-0030 149.872375 152.330250 is is it's a good idea but
sw3660B-ms98-a-0031 152.330250 163.140750 like you said the drug testing procedures need to be defined a little better or make sure it's a lot safer because_1 a couple of people are going to be discriminated against unfairly or whatever yeah i i i tend to agree with you David
sw3660B-ms98-a-0032 163.140750 173.342500 yeah my brother uh my brother used to work for Wal-Mart and then i don't know if he still does or what because_1 i don't know if Sam's is actually part of it but he you know is working at Sam's now

sw3660B-ms98-a-0034 182.034500 185.327125 telling me about good profit sharing and all that so

sw3660B-ms98-a-0041 204.534625 214.735250 yeah that's what my brother was telling me that's good good new[s]- good deal well uh how long were we su[pposed]- i haven't done this in a couple months how long were we supposed to discuss for
sw3660B-ms98-a-0042 214.735250 221.761750 okay we got a couple more minutes then i guess [noise] uh think what else i can say about that um
sw3660B-ms98-a-0043 221.761750 229.952500 [silence]
sw3660B-ms98-a-0044 229.952500 234.751250 right um everyone coming in gets goes through the drug test
sw3660B-ms98-a-0045 234.751250 242.285500 [silence]
sw3660B-ms98-a-0046 242.285500 252.350375 uh no well let me think about that yeah it was after i w[as]- i had already been hired um yeah you get hired then you come in the first i
sw3660B-ms98-a-0047 252.350375 260.035250 seems to me i remember that uh i was hired came in and went through some orientation and i thought i
sw3660B-ms98-a-0048 260.035250 261.197500 [silence]
sw3660B-ms98-a-0049 261.197500 273.447625 boy i can't remember that would seem strange to already be working here in the first week of the drug test maybe it was during the interview i came up a couple times for an interview so it's hard for me to remember where i was when all that happened
sw3660B-ms98-a-0050 273.447625 286.022125 but uh i guess just like other companies other friends i've been hearing about that have been moving around it's it's before they have to wait for the drug test to come in before you actually get employment so i'm sure that happened to me too
sw3660B-ms98-a-0051 286.022125 290.670125 what what about oh they just instituted it there at Wal-Mart so
