sw3659B-ms98-a-0035 133.078125 141.435625 you don't get too much money back i figure it pays for the gas to take my cans over there but normally i collect oh like three trash bags full
sw3659B-ms98-a-0036 141.435625 149.610875 and i take them_1 over to that can bank and it's more fun just to kind of like crunch the cans [laughter] [laughter-in] [laughter-the] [laughter-can] [laughter-bank] you don't get too much money for them_1 but [laughter]

sw3659B-ms98-a-0046 179.366250 187.560125 ah i'm disappointed sometimes they're not always consistent in picking up those papers you know i seem to put them_1 out there on Wednesday and like sometimes they come by
sw3659B-ms98-a-0047 187.560125 192.016875 sometimes they don't i'm not really sure why they're not always consistent in that
sw3659B-ms98-a-0048 192.016875 205.490000 but i could certainly have uh three bins out there for you know plastic and and tin and paper whatever they were going to uh separate into and and have them pick it up on on one of the two days per week that would be easy
sw3659B-ms98-a-0049 205.490000 211.096625 [silence]
sw3659B-ms98-a-0050 211.096625 214.972375 you're not supposed to have like the coupons in there
sw3659B-ms98-a-0051 214.972375 221.065125 um or you're not supposed to put magazines in there and you can't take newspapers now at work
sw3659B-ms98-a-0052 221.065125 229.020875 uh you know we have changed our recycling at first they were kind of finicky about what kind of paper you could recycle
sw3659B-ms98-a-0053 229.020875 236.308000 and not too long ago they finally decided if it's anything that's paper and tears you can throw it in there because_1 at first they said
sw3659B-ms98-a-0054 236.308000 240.380375 yeah at first they said they said no telephone books
sw3659B-ms98-a-0055 240.380375 246.816125 you know that well that's stupid and then they said no newspapers well in the my department everybody gets the Wall Street Journal
sw3659B-ms98-a-0056 246.816125 254.851000 there was like a lot of paper coming out of our department that wasn't recyclable so i thought that was pretty good to expand upon it and say anything paper
sw3659B-ms98-a-0057 254.851000 261.804875 yeah i still put my cans in with the cans i th[ink]- i don't want it with paper somehow it just seems weird to me [laughter]

sw3659B-ms98-a-0063 279.965625 285.799500 she collected she used to collect from the whole department but she took them_1 all down to that Dallas Shelter place
sw3659B-ms98-a-0064 285.799500 291.382875 i wish i could remember that whole name of that place but it's a charity for the benefit of this shelter
sw3659B-ms98-a-0065 291.382875 299.042000 uh yeah she u[sed]- she used to collect them from everybody in the department she'd go up and down with her little bag [laughter] collecting from everybody
