sw3659A-ms98-a-0010 38.698500 41.332250 [silence]
sw3659A-ms98-a-0011 41.332250 50.058625 hm well i'm i'm in Dallas proper in the city of Dallas and i know they do have you know a pilot program going on but it's not here
sw3659A-ms98-a-0012 50.058625 60.987875 so they're not picking up anything [laughter] so i mean we we collect everything we've got all these boxes in our garage for you know green glass and clear glass and plastic and everything
sw3659A-ms98-a-0013 60.987875 66.327875 but um well there's there's a couple places unfortunately we can't find a place that'll take everything
sw3659A-ms98-a-0014 66.327875 78.233000 um there's a lot of places to take like the plastic um shopping bags like most of the grocery stores and there's a Wal-Mart nearby that takes almost everything i can't remember what it is they don't take
sw3659A-ms98-a-0015 78.233000 90.645250 and the library will take glass so we end up you know on the weekend we pack it all in the car and and as we go [laughter-places] we oh wait we can drop the glass off [laughter] you know drop things off one at a time
sw3659A-ms98-a-0016 90.645250 100.620375 but um and it's kind of disappointing i mean i would even be happy if they just had one you know one place where you could do everything you know it would still be more convenient than what we have now
sw3659A-ms98-a-0017 100.620375 108.670375 [silence]
sw3659A-ms98-a-0018 108.670375 111.173875 hm where is that
sw3659A-ms98-a-0019 111.173875 112.465500 [silence]
sw3659A-ms98-a-0020 112.465500 116.091500 oh i'm pretty far north i'm not
sw3659A-ms98-a-0021 116.091500 119.715250 i'm i'm i'm just i'm north of Addison actually
sw3659A-ms98-a-0022 119.715250 124.868500 so i'm i'm really [laughter] i'm s[ort]- i'm in Dallas but only technically [laughter]
sw3659A-ms98-a-0023 124.868500 128.633375 [silence]
sw3659A-ms98-a-0024 128.633375 130.582375 uh-huh yeah
sw3659A-ms98-a-0025 130.582375 132.595125 [silence]
sw3659A-ms98-a-0026 132.595125 134.766500 yeah i've seen those
sw3659A-ms98-a-0027 134.766500 137.084250 [silence]
sw3659A-ms98-a-0028 137.084250 138.516750 yeah
sw3659A-ms98-a-0029 138.516750 140.852125 [silence]
sw3659A-ms98-a-0030 140.852125 142.325625 yep
sw3659A-ms98-a-0031 142.325625 144.360625 uh-huh
sw3659A-ms98-a-0032 144.360625 148.363000 [laughter]
sw3659A-ms98-a-0033 148.363000 150.493000 well you get something [laughter]
sw3659A-ms98-a-0034 150.493000 158.838375 uh we used to do that but again that's another stop and it doesn't take plastic bags and and all that sort of thing but um
sw3659A-ms98-a-0035 158.838375 169.454125 i think that you know i heard that it was going well in the pilot area wherever that is and so hopefully they'll do it soon that would be good because we have two trash pick ups a week
sw3659A-ms98-a-0036 169.454125 178.282625 where i grew up we only had one a week and that was certainly sufficient so if they just do one of them will be trash and the alternate time would do recyclables that'd be great
sw3659A-ms98-a-0037 178.282625 180.656875 so i hope they do
sw3659A-ms98-a-0038 180.656875 184.605875 [silence]
