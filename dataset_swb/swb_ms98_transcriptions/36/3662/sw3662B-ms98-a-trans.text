sw3662B-ms98-a-0004 6.735250 18.354750 [noise] well uh i'm [vocalized-noise] i'm certainly under the uh uh the influence of the idea that that the government needs to have less control on what uh
sw3662B-ms98-a-0005 18.354750 22.454125 what the citizens do although i do see this as uh
sw3662B-ms98-a-0006 22.454125 37.008750 uh something that definitely needs to be taken care of whether that whether that should be put in the hands of the corporation or in the g[overnment]- or the hands of hands of the government is a you know a a different question i think as far as i'm concerned uh in a in other words i am fa[vor]- in favor of drug contr[ol]- or or or drug testing
sw3662B-ms98-a-0007 37.008750 48.660000 um i was drug tested when i came to my job here at TI yet but but at the same time i don't think uh that should be governed by by the government uh per se i think it should be b[y]- more by the private institution

sw3662B-ms98-a-0018 95.011875 102.099625 [vocalized-noise] the biggest problem i think to face America today i mean [vocalized-noise] it's what drives crime it's what drives
sw3662B-ms98-a-0019 102.099625 113.081250 um uh any sort of of uh uh pain and discomfort in the world [vocalized-noise] or in America i think it's some[what]- it's somewhat um driven by drugs and i think that
sw3662B-ms98-a-0020 113.081250 121.703625 uh were corporations and uh private industry to take um take command in this situation that maybe
sw3662B-ms98-a-0021 121.703625 129.959500 maybe we might have some some control over that we you know if you can't work then you can't [noise] be a little bit harder to take take the drugs or whatever i don't know
sw3662B-ms98-a-0022 129.959500 138.416500 course that might up crime you know and uh people go in and steal your television and stea[l]- and sell it just because they can't they can't work anymore you know
