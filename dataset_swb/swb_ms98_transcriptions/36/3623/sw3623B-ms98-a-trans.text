sw3623B-ms98-a-0014 40.999625 46.766000 yeah that's right i i think that's what happened to everybody out there gets back when they just sent them_1 to you without any
sw3623B-ms98-a-0015 46.766000 49.916750 i've got i don't know how many tons of them_1 but uh
sw3623B-ms98-a-0016 49.916750 55.995000 i use uh well this one particular one for everything i mean everything i buy including groceries
sw3623B-ms98-a-0017 55.995000 63.438000 and it runs up pretty high every month but i then i pay it off because i get a a air uh advantage miles on American
sw3623B-ms98-a-0018 63.438000 72.066125 with it so i i can get a you know i've already gotten a free trip just from using that card so i don't uh i don't have any carry over balances any more
sw3623B-ms98-a-0019 72.066125 81.029250 but i just i was wiped out there for years but that was the way to do stuff and uh you i think you have to make the decision
sw3623B-ms98-a-0020 81.029250 87.500125 but um Texas is uh you know it's a debtor state and if you get in too big of a trap you
sw3623B-ms98-a-0021 87.500125 92.459250 you can just blow them_1 off and that's not good but i know lot of people do it 
sw3623B-ms98-a-0022 92.459250 97.167125 it's what runs that interest rate up you know pretty high yeah

sw3623B-ms98-a-0031 128.859500 133.409875 uh some of mine are up i think up over twenty percent i don't use them_1 anymore but i think
