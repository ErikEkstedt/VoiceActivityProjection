sw3689A-ms98-a-0028 132.262875 142.472250 i know i don't see how people can do that either but i know a lot of my friends have gotten in tr[ouble]- deep trouble with them and it's like well why'd you guys do it oh well it's so easy to use [laughter]
sw3689A-ms98-a-0029 142.472250 149.636750 and it's like yeah it's easy to use but you have to pay for it you know [laughter] didn't this dawn on you but
sw3689A-ms98-a-0030 149.636750 154.683500 i got my credit cards through a guarantee agency do you know what that is
sw3689A-ms98-a-0031 154.683500 159.178125 you give them you put so much money in an annuity
sw3689A-ms98-a-0032 159.178125 167.510250 and it guarantees your credit card like say if something happened to you they could still pay off the balance with what's in there
sw3689A-ms98-a-0033 167.510250 171.545375 and whatever your limit is you keep that much in your annuity fund
sw3689A-ms98-a-0034 171.545375 176.803750 and it's worked pretty good for what i've had it for about five years now
sw3689A-ms98-a-0035 176.803750 184.553375 and you can take the annuity out the money out of the annuity if you want to but it's just there like you know in case you died suddenly or something
sw3689A-ms98-a-0036 184.553375 187.311625 you know they wouldn't be stuck with the bill
sw3689A-ms98-a-0037 187.311625 190.112500 so i like it that way

sw3689A-ms98-a-0043 207.981875 212.611125 but i'll tell you what it comes in real handy when you've got kids [laughter]
