sw3689B-ms98-a-0056 237.042750 239.829375 [silence]
sw3689B-ms98-a-0057 239.829375 251.145625 i forget where i was i know i was in Europe one time and they ran out of money but i couldn't get money on my credit card eith[er]- oh i was up i was dating a woman upstate New York and i was up in uh upstate and i
sw3689B-ms98-a-0058 251.145625 264.075125 had been in college and i guess i took like a hundred two hundred dollars with me or whatever at that ti[me]- time maybe fifty bucks was enough to live on for a week but i [laughter] i took some money with me and i ran out of money like at the end of the first weekend i was supposed to be there for a week 
sw3689B-ms98-a-0059 264.075125 271.906250 and i needed to i called up my father and i said dad you know go to my bank account and withdraw a couple of hundred bucks or whatever it was and could you
sw3689B-ms98-a-0060 271.906250 282.306125 send it Western Union and it was a pain in the neck i had to like wait till Monday and you know wait till the office opened and it took time and everything became a pain so what i did was i uh
sw3689B-ms98-a-0061 282.306125 291.902000 so what i did right after that is i got myself a credit card in case it ever happened again i can always you know buy something on the credit card and and not have to worry about carrying cash around
sw3689B-ms98-a-0062 291.902000 297.623750 so that was about ten ten twelve years ago and i've always had one since and like you said for that reason it's it's easy
sw3689B-ms98-a-0063 297.623750 299.458000 you know if you need the cash i couldn't imagine
