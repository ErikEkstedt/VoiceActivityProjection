sw3670B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.396625 [noise]
sw3670B-ms98-a-0002 1.396625 3.663875 sure i guess [laughter]
sw3670B-ms98-a-0003 3.663875 14.080125 i'm trying to think do we pay too much taxes uh uh well i it it certainly seems like it i don't know you know i i i'm not up in the uh in in the high end brackets myself and so
sw3670B-ms98-a-0004 14.080125 22.539875 i can just imagine how bad that would hurt i remember at one point when my dad was paying uh nearly nearly sixty percent ta[x]- tax bracket and that was just you know
sw3670B-ms98-a-0005 22.539875 25.207125 it was killing him [laughter]
sw3670B-ms98-a-0006 25.207125 42.281000 [silence]
sw3670B-ms98-a-0007 42.281000 51.630625 yeah uh i mean other places pay more and you know so you can look at some place like Sweden and you know they they almost all give like seventy percent of their income to the government
sw3670B-ms98-a-0008 51.630625 63.838750 um they get some different things out of it though uh i don't know i i'm not i'm not terribly pleased with the distribution of of of it and i think we we spend entirely too much on defense
sw3670B-ms98-a-0009 63.838750 75.641750 um although i work in in sort of hi tech industry type thing and and and which in large part survives on on uh on defense contracting you know so
sw3670B-ms98-a-0010 75.641750 79.180875 so i mean i kind of biting the hand that feeds you if you really wanna
sw3670B-ms98-a-0011 79.180875 80.502250 [laughter]
sw3670B-ms98-a-0012 80.502250 82.720000 sorry cutting it hard but um
sw3670B-ms98-a-0013 82.720000 94.613875 i don't know you know it seems like it seems like we ought to be able to get a little bit uh things ought to be a little bit more efficiently run and i i i and i think that we could get by without continually raising taxes
sw3670B-ms98-a-0014 94.613875 105.514000 you know i mean i think i think we're at a point where you know it's it's taxes are a burden but their you know um services come out of it and and things are important but on the other hand
sw3670B-ms98-a-0015 105.514000 110.437250 you know they just can't continue to rise forever and the deficit can't continue to grow
sw3670B-ms98-a-0016 110.437250 122.332375 you know there's there's got to be some point where people sit down and say okay you know this is enough income to give government services at and we need to make sure we give good government service at this point and you know and
sw3670B-ms98-a-0017 122.332375 126.451875 [silence]
sw3670B-ms98-a-0018 126.451875 127.844500 um-hum

sw3670B-ms98-a-0024 144.999750 158.530625 right right you know th[ere]- there there isn't there isn't the business cycle where where where government gets uh gets chopped down you know i mean a[nd]- they they don't go through a restructuring y[ou]- you know even IBM going through a cutbacks right and and you know government just doesn't do it
sw3670B-ms98-a-0025 158.530625 164.515250 you know a[nd]- a[nd]- and and it's because of in part you know necessary protections for the worker
sw3670B-ms98-a-0026 164.515250 170.653625 b[ut]- but on the other hand there's you know you you you've got to plan them_1 in the real world also you kn[ow]-
sw3670B-ms98-a-0027 170.653625 181.240250 [silence]
sw3670B-ms98-a-0028 181.240250 182.888250 um-hum

sw3670B-ms98-a-0037 204.028625 213.022875 right yeah i mean i think i think y[ou]- you know in general i'm i'm pretty pleased with the government with you know with America and and a lot of the things that work here i mean
sw3670B-ms98-a-0038 213.022875 220.572000 i[t]- there there's lots of things that don't quite work right and um but if you've ever spent any time in other countries you realize
sw3670B-ms98-a-0039 220.572000 228.221250 that that its all a relative i[ssue]- issue you know every[where]- everywhere things don't work right and some places they really don't work right and here they they [laughter-pretty] much work right you know 
sw3670B-ms98-a-0040 228.221250 241.625750 um but i think you know i mean if if things are gonna things that need to change are things that that need to be sort of restructuring you know maybe market orientation a little bit more and and things like what you're talking about um
sw3670B-ms98-a-0041 241.625750 253.988875 you know putting a little bit more of the pre[ssures]- of the of the business pressures that are nor[mal]- that are on everybody else on the government and uh so that we get a little bit more out of the tax dollars and a little bit
sw3670B-ms98-a-0042 253.988875 264.258875 [silence]
sw3670B-ms98-a-0043 264.258875 265.311000 um

sw3670B-ms98-a-0048 277.605125 286.579000 yeah i i think m[y]- my wife's from Brazil and i've spent a fair amount of time there and and you wanna see a government system that just doesn't work you know i mean it's just its incredible its just
sw3670B-ms98-a-0049 286.579000 295.456375 entirely corrupt they have uh you know something like uh seventy five percent or sixty five percent of the able bodied workers are employed by the government
sw3670B-ms98-a-0050 295.456375 298.562000 you know and so that leaves everybody else you know this other small
