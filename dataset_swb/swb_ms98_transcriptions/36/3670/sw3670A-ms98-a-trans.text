sw3670A-ms98-a-0009 23.618000 33.127125 yeah and i think that's that's basically my standpoint too is my dad and i've talked about this a lot and i just personally i think it's kind of i don't know we pay a lot
sw3670A-ms98-a-0010 33.127125 36.702875 um sometimes i I know that it's not used very wisely
sw3670A-ms98-a-0011 36.702875 42.931250 and i think the big thing for me and what my dad has said is we pay a lot but it's worth it to live in America i guess for our freedom

sw3670A-ms98-a-0034 119.597750 120.942000 um-hum
sw3670A-ms98-a-0035 120.942000 126.984250 and the sad thing i think personally you know i don't mind paying so much taxes if i'm getting what's due
sw3670A-ms98-a-0036 126.984250 139.356750 but i think a lot of times what happens is you get into the government system and my dad works for the government in some ways and he works a lot with people who are paid by the government and there are so many things to quote unquote protect the employee
sw3670A-ms98-a-0037 139.356750 145.777750 that you know y[ou're]- you're you're not getting what you're paying for a lot of times whereas in any other business situation it'd be see you you know
sw3670A-ms98-a-0038 145.777750 158.030125 [silence]
sw3670A-ms98-a-0039 158.030125 159.370625 yeah

sw3670A-ms98-a-0042 165.247250 169.134000 [silence]
sw3670A-ms98-a-0043 169.134000 181.885875 yeah and you got to walk that fine line i think one of the things that the government really could could save a lot of money on is is you know when it's for example in defense spending when it's something that you can use like an ashtray you know
sw3670A-ms98-a-0044 181.885875 190.258000 just go buy it at a store my gosh and [laughter] or buy it from a manufacturer instead of having it made and have to form the mold and everything you know
sw3670A-ms98-a-0045 190.258000 197.603000 and granted there's other things for example that you know a microwave or something if you're underwater you'd have to have some specific specifications but
sw3670A-ms98-a-0046 197.603000 204.680875 but just to work out with our tax money you know watch where is it going to be best used and how is it going to be most effective cost wise
sw3670A-ms98-a-0047 204.680875 209.368000 [silence]
sw3670A-ms98-a-0048 209.368000 210.712000 oh yeah

sw3670A-ms98-a-0064 252.342000 260.026375 and i agree with you there i think you know there there's nothing in my opinion from what i've seen and the people i've worked with some other countries and from our own country that
sw3670A-ms98-a-0065 260.026375 268.505750 that would ever take the place of the freedoms and the the the things that we have here for me i you know i i guess when it comes right down to it if it was living in a place
sw3670A-ms98-a-0066 268.505750 276.704750 like Mexico or Russia that are really struggling both with the government and with economics i would prefer to pay my extra tax money here and
sw3670A-ms98-a-0067 276.704750 278.795875 and have things the way they are
