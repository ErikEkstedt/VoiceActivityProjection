sw3673B-ms98-a-0004 5.475375 8.784125 well usually it works out pretty well
sw3673B-ms98-a-0005 8.784125 14.717875 um i try to project out um right now i project out six months
sw3673B-ms98-a-0006 14.717875 19.774500 you know i have my fixed monthly bills and i know how much they are
sw3673B-ms98-a-0007 19.774500 24.979375 and uh i have a percentage of my savings that i attempt to
sw3673B-ms98-a-0008 24.979375 26.767125 take off the top
sw3673B-ms98-a-0009 26.767125 33.133250 not unless i have something come up that's unusual that i was unexpected and then i may have to go into savings
sw3673B-ms98-a-0010 33.133250 34.719250 and
sw3673B-ms98-a-0011 34.719250 35.961250 [silence]
sw3673B-ms98-a-0012 35.961250 41.054250 kind of the formula i use i use uh ninety percent of my check
sw3673B-ms98-a-0013 41.054250 46.656000 and then i retain ten percent and if i don't use it then it goes into savings also
sw3673B-ms98-a-0014 46.656000 51.311750 [silence]
sw3673B-ms98-a-0015 51.311750 61.877750 well my monthly bills are pretty consistent you know you have your house payments the same every month uh car payments are the same you know when your insurance is due
sw3673B-ms98-a-0016 61.877750 70.347125 so you budget all that in that's why a lot of times i only use ninety percent of my salary because some months i'll have insurance
sw3673B-ms98-a-0017 70.347125 72.068500 um
sw3673B-ms98-a-0018 72.068500 74.002000 two or three times a year

sw3673B-ms98-a-0023 85.060625 100.344750 um-hum a month at a time is not a really a big picture of what's going on in your life because it doesn't give you any flexibility as far as uh unforeseen situations or something coming down the road that you know is coming down the road that you need to save for
sw3673B-ms98-a-0024 100.344750 106.807000 [silence]

sw3673B-ms98-a-0062 253.275000 263.893250 one thing we do about the groceries and wh[en]- and we just got back from the grocery store and we've been doing this for a long time and we know exactly how much we spend at the grocery store because_1 when we come home we write it down
sw3673B-ms98-a-0063 263.893250 266.187250 so in a given month
sw3673B-ms98-a-0064 266.187250 275.199625 we know that we spent two hundred and fifty dollars or four hundred dollars or whatever it is and if it's four hundred dollars we look at it and say well why did we spend four hundred dollars
sw3673B-ms98-a-0065 275.199625 281.749375 and we spent four hundred dollars this month because or last month because uh we had several Christmas parties
sw3673B-ms98-a-0066 281.749375 290.232125 so but we know approximately how much our our monthly grocery bill is you know and and you should be able to do that too within
sw3673B-ms98-a-0067 290.232125 295.634250 ten or fifteen percent of what uh what you spend once you get a track record
sw3673B-ms98-a-0068 295.634250 298.946000 and once you establish your track record
