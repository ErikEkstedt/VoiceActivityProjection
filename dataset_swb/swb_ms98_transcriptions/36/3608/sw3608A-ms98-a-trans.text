sw3608A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 8.623750 the most [noise] the interesting political development of the whole year and everything that's been happening in the former Soviet Union with the break up and the reconstitution
sw3608A-ms98-a-0002 8.623750 20.519750 [silence]
sw3608A-ms98-a-0003 20.519750 27.833625 well you've got to wonder what really happened in the so-called August Coup who really planned that thing out who stood to benefit
sw3608A-ms98-a-0004 27.833625 33.339875 [silence]
sw3608A-ms98-a-0005 33.339875 39.023875 oh well i suspect that Mister Yeltsin probably knows a lot more about it than he's ever let on
sw3608A-ms98-a-0006 39.023875 44.509250 [silence]
sw3608A-ms98-a-0007 44.509250 45.941375 well
sw3608A-ms98-a-0008 45.941375 53.426375 [silence]
sw3608A-ms98-a-0009 53.426375 60.678875 of course there's always the problem of the twelfth republic Georgia that's in a civil war right now what happens with them
sw3608A-ms98-a-0010 60.678875 66.622875 [silence]
sw3608A-ms98-a-0011 66.622875 70.844750 no their no they they went all three of those
sw3608A-ms98-a-0012 70.844750 77.358875 Latvia Estonia and Lithuania went completely independent and had nothing to do with the commonwealth of states
sw3608A-ms98-a-0013 77.358875 87.735250 so they each three separate republics although i think the three of them have gone in together in some sort of confederation while they each are are supposedly independent
sw3608A-ms98-a-0014 87.735250 100.192750 [silence]
sw3608A-ms98-a-0015 100.192750 109.198000 well then what happens in the UN Russia supposedly gets the Soviet Union's seat and what happens with the eleven other republics i guess they don't get anything who knows
sw3608A-ms98-a-0016 109.198000 124.090250 [silence]
sw3608A-ms98-a-0017 124.090250 136.540375 i don't know if these all are really independent countries or like states in the United States it almost looks likes some ways like the old Confederate States of America is almost what this arrangement looks like
sw3608A-ms98-a-0018 136.540375 138.235625 [silence]
sw3608A-ms98-a-0019 138.235625 152.282750 you've got uh eleven or twelve basically quote independent republics which are in a confederation does look a lot you know i think if we went back and looked at Civil War documents it'd be a similar arrangement to the Confederate States of America
sw3608A-ms98-a-0020 152.282750 162.459875 [silence]
sw3608A-ms98-a-0021 162.459875 173.630375 well you have to look back to the great expansion of Peter the Great followed by Catherine the Great uh which pretty well set the course for what then became the Soviet Union
sw3608A-ms98-a-0022 173.630375 178.814375 i mean it has its roots back there in the in the early seventeen hundreds
sw3608A-ms98-a-0023 178.814375 195.519250 [silence]
sw3608A-ms98-a-0024 195.519250 199.212500 oh i think one person put it aptly the ruble is rubbish
sw3608A-ms98-a-0025 199.212500 201.969125 [silence]
sw3608A-ms98-a-0026 201.969125 206.615875 course then the problem is what they do with their nuclear weapons that's the more interesting problem
sw3608A-ms98-a-0027 206.615875 241.191125 [silence]
sw3608A-ms98-a-0028 241.191125 243.779750 well who knows what they're going to do with them
sw3608A-ms98-a-0029 243.779750 251.005625 [silence]
sw3608A-ms98-a-0030 251.005625 256.094625 well of course the question is what Gorbachev does i guess he goes and writes his memoirs or something
sw3608A-ms98-a-0031 256.094625 259.827500 [silence]
sw3608A-ms98-a-0032 259.827500 262.104125 i think he's turned that down now
sw3608A-ms98-a-0033 262.104125 271.568500 [silence]
sw3608A-ms98-a-0034 271.568500 278.862625 well i don't think he i don't think he wants to do that but he he certainly would be like an elder statesman or whatever
sw3608A-ms98-a-0035 278.862625 289.930500 [silence]
sw3608A-ms98-a-0036 289.930500 294.053375 or how i survived the August Coup but really didn't survive it
sw3608A-ms98-a-0037 294.053375 298.690000 [silence]
