sw3608B-ms98-a-0003 7.649750 19.841000 yeah i agree i been interesting to see how Gorbachev has uh been releasing the power to Yeltsin including including the uh button for the nuclear arsenals
sw3608B-ms98-a-0004 19.841000 27.200375 [silence]
sw3608B-ms98-a-0005 27.200375 34.323875 yes uh i agree it's uh [noise] that's some things that nobody may ever know for sure
sw3608B-ms98-a-0006 34.323875 38.256750 [silence]
sw3608B-ms98-a-0007 38.256750 43.561750 [noise] yeah he may but it'll be interesting to see how this sort of loose commonwealth uh
sw3608B-ms98-a-0008 43.561750 53.602750 works from the standpoint of uh being as one political entity or whether it's really just going to be kind of a loose confederation
sw3608B-ms98-a-0009 53.602750 60.303750 [silence]
sw3608B-ms98-a-0010 60.303750 66.873000 [noise] also uh did uh did those Baltic States did Astonia and Latvia et cetera did they
sw3608B-ms98-a-0011 66.873000 69.418250 pitch their lot in with them or
sw3608B-ms98-a-0012 69.418250 87.892625 [silence]
sw3608B-ms98-a-0013 87.892625 100.553750 it may be interesting to see how when they start talking about border defense whether they're gonna i think most of those independent countries are going to decide that they want to defend their own borders
sw3608B-ms98-a-0014 100.553750 108.475625 [silence]
sw3608B-ms98-a-0015 108.475625 111.986375 well [vocalized-noise] i think the
sw3608B-ms98-a-0016 111.986375 124.470000 what Russia's going to bid for is the seat on the Security Council but i suppose that all of the other eleven can or the ten others or however many there are can be admitted as regular members of the UN
sw3608B-ms98-a-0017 124.470000 136.611000 [silence]
sw3608B-ms98-a-0018 136.611000 139.683750 yeah could be it's gonna be
sw3608B-ms98-a-0019 139.683750 151.951125 [silence]
sw3608B-ms98-a-0020 151.951125 157.070000 yeah could be [noise] could be although they
sw3608B-ms98-a-0021 157.070000 164.635000 a lot of those existed as states prior to uh to their being a Soviet Union so i- i don't know
sw3608B-ms98-a-0022 164.635000 178.952000 [silence]
sw3608B-ms98-a-0023 178.952000 190.393250 yeah that's true i don't know what uh currency things are going to be done too whether each one will have to completely establish a currency based on whatever system
sw3608B-ms98-a-0024 190.393250 195.450500 or whether they can rely on the ruble somehow and uh
sw3608B-ms98-a-0025 195.450500 196.999125 and uh
sw3608B-ms98-a-0026 196.999125 198.771000 [silence]
sw3608B-ms98-a-0027 198.771000 202.026125 well that's true probably for any of them_1
sw3608B-ms98-a-0028 202.026125 205.457500 [silence]
sw3608B-ms98-a-0029 205.457500 219.024750 well there's only four states that have any though only the Ukraine and Belorussia and Russia themselves and then that one middle Asian the one that starts with a K [Konestan/Kazhakstan] or something whatever that is 
sw3608B-ms98-a-0030 219.024750 225.130000 uh they're the only four and two of the four have said they would like to destroy them_1
sw3608B-ms98-a-0031 225.130000 234.051625 it's only that fourth one that worries me a little bit but they don't have any intercontinental ballistic missiles down there either they have short range
sw3608B-ms98-a-0032 234.051625 238.485000 nuclear capability and presumably not very many of them_1
sw3608B-ms98-a-0033 238.485000 241.550125 judging by where that is
sw3608B-ms98-a-0034 241.550125 252.036250 Russia had ninety percent of them_1 on Russian soil so they're still going to control the by and large the large amount of those
sw3608B-ms98-a-0035 252.036250 255.682250 [silence]
sw3608B-ms98-a-0036 255.682250 261.035750 he's been offered a position in the United States in Colorado to teach [laughter]
sw3608B-ms98-a-0037 261.035750 272.051375 [noise] yeah i imagine he would because he'd have to move over here lock stock and barrel and he's still got children and grandchildren there in in Russia so
sw3608B-ms98-a-0038 272.051375 277.996125 [silence]
sw3608B-ms98-a-0039 277.996125 290.303750 [noise] well he certainly give lectures around the world if he wanted to do that on an informal basis he could also uh [noise] like you say uh write a book probably be a best seller [laughter]
sw3608B-ms98-a-0040 290.303750 293.370875 [silence]
sw3608B-ms98-a-0041 293.370875 298.690000 yeah well it's all been a outgrowth of what he started he started [noise] uh
