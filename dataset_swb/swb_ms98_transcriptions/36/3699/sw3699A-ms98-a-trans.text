sw3699A-ms98-a-0041 212.934500 214.348750 [silence]
sw3699A-ms98-a-0042 214.348750 225.092000 you know that's interesting you say that because we do have we have those architectural codes here and when we um put our house in um they wanted us to have there was one
sw3699A-ms98-a-0043 225.092000 238.080750 we have part siding i[t]- o[n]- on the two story part and then on the back and they there was one side where our chimney was and just the chimney was gonna be brick and they wanted us to have more brick so we ended up having to go halfway up
sw3699A-ms98-a-0044 238.080750 244.844750 which it does look nicer and you know we would have liked to have had all brick but of course at that point we couldn't afford it and
sw3699A-ms98-a-0045 244.844750 252.713750 but it's funny that you'd say that because there were homes in here that didn't have any brick at all so it's kind of like they were
sw3699A-ms98-a-0046 252.713750 263.371750 yeah yeah and i and so it was kind of like it's they ours is the last street that they built on so the houses actually on our street are a little bit they've kind of gone a little bit nicer
sw3699A-ms98-a-0047 263.371750 277.199375 yeah i mean just they you know it's like the second phase and and so they've kind of changed the the codes a little bit and so that's kind of why i guess they stuck us with more brick when there were other homes that didn't have any an[d]-
