sw3699B-ms98-a-0048 191.094875 201.058250 uh the neighborhood actually fought him on it because he he was um the house was gonna cost less to build than any other house in the neighborhood
sw3699B-ms98-a-0049 201.058250 215.250750 now that's because he was he's doing a lot of it himself and you know for example landscaping and and lots of the other stuff and his house actually ends up being nicer than lots of [laughter-other] in the neighborhood but but they were they were pretty touchy on it he was a little surprised
