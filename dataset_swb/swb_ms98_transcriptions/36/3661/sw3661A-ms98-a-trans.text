sw3661A-ms98-a-0025 151.755000 158.544125 course i think a lot of it was due to the mild weather and the rain but i had tomatoes on the table every day for five months which is
sw3661A-ms98-a-0026 158.544125 167.925500 in the in the past i usually got tomatoes for three four weeks and that would be it and then in the fall i'd you know get a couple more weeks but this is a very unusual year

sw3661A-ms98-a-0032 198.659125 204.040750 set up the garden and get everything but once the plants get going and then it's just a matter of keeping the insects off
