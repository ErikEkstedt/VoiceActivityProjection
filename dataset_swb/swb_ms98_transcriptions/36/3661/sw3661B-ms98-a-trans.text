sw3661B-ms98-a-0064 214.711125 228.328500 i guess a pump[kin]- a squash plant you know turned out to be a pumpkin and uh it it bore pretty good size fruit and then one year we just let one of the squashes grow out produced a really huge pumpkin 
sw3661B-ms98-a-0065 228.328500 237.203500 we're pretty surprised and they just got lucky because_1 they didn't do anything to it no fertilizing or anything just kind of [laughter-threw] the seeds out there

sw3661B-ms98-a-0072 278.927250 288.935625 because_1 all around me i can see where the erosion is from from the creek beds there's a lot of rock under me i have a feeling i'm i'm probably the roots are probably hitting rocks or something
