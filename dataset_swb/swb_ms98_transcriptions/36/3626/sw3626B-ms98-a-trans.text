sw3626B-ms98-a-0004 5.876625 9.245500 uh yes um we own one
sw3626B-ms98-a-0005 9.245500 19.132750 uh its an Emerson eighty eighty six um two low density floppy drives and no hard drive yet
sw3626B-ms98-a-0006 19.132750 24.324375 but uh you know it's it comes in mighty handy
sw3626B-ms98-a-0007 24.324375 25.863625 [silence]
sw3626B-ms98-a-0008 25.863625 36.981375 uh yeah a big chunk of it's word processing we're also taking programming classes and uh so there's a fair amount of programming getting done on it but uh
sw3626B-ms98-a-0009 36.981375 46.169875 the uh right now we got a project going we're trying to put um all my wife's stray recipes on the disk
sw3626B-ms98-a-0010 46.169875 49.865750 [silence]
sw3626B-ms98-a-0011 49.865750 59.721125 uh it came with a menus program but uh that doesn't it is [maceboast/mostly] excuse me mostly kind of a pain in the neck without a hard drive
sw3626B-ms98-a-0012 59.721125 63.961625 and hopefully sometime this spring we'll be able to get one and get it configured
sw3626B-ms98-a-0013 63.961625 66.528250 [silence]
sw3626B-ms98-a-0014 66.528250 68.360750 eighty eighty six

sw3626B-ms98-a-0016 72.961875 74.502125 which
sw3626B-ms98-a-0017 74.502125 75.916875 ah
sw3626B-ms98-a-0018 75.916875 78.752375 impoverished college student
sw3626B-ms98-a-0019 78.752375 84.883125 this one went on a credit card and we got a way out while to pay it off yet so it's
sw3626B-ms98-a-0020 84.883125 87.996750 [silence]
sw3626B-ms98-a-0021 87.996750 88.838375 uh
sw3626B-ms98-a-0022 88.838375 93.410125 [silence]
sw3626B-ms98-a-0023 93.410125 96.126500 oh that sounds nice

sw3626B-ms98-a-0027 107.769875 109.382000 okay
sw3626B-ms98-a-0028 109.382000 111.935250 that sounds like a fine job
sw3626B-ms98-a-0029 111.935250 114.505375 [silence]
sw3626B-ms98-a-0030 114.505375 115.983500 yes

sw3626B-ms98-a-0032 117.510625 120.288000 ah computer engineering 
sw3626B-ms98-a-0033 120.288000 129.311375 well it's computer engineering technology uh which uh it's all i can understand is just this slightly more hands on version of computer engineering
sw3626B-ms98-a-0034 129.311375 139.375250 but i've got a ways to go yet so far most of what i've done is getting gotten core classes out of the way taken some electronics classes
sw3626B-ms98-a-0035 139.375250 144.964000 and one class in um with computer logic
sw3626B-ms98-a-0036 144.964000 146.459125 [silence]
sw3626B-ms98-a-0037 146.459125 158.348625 oh yes yeah i rather enjoy it myself [laughter] the uh lab for that uh um computer logic class was a lot of fun
sw3626B-ms98-a-0038 158.348625 166.299875 yeah we got to hook up a few uh counters and and uh de[coders]- encoders
sw3626B-ms98-a-0039 166.299875 168.009625 yeah
sw3626B-ms98-a-0040 168.009625 170.025125 [silence]
sw3626B-ms98-a-0041 170.025125 183.981625 i've not gotten a chance to work with it although um m[y]- uh -[m]y data structures teacher was telling us something about wh[y]- how [fudgy/fuzzy] fuzzy logic works as far as the concept behind it
sw3626B-ms98-a-0042 183.981625 194.232875 now how you'd implement that uh software wise or mechanically i don't know but uh it sounds like a very impressive piece of piece of work
sw3626B-ms98-a-0043 194.232875 199.466000 [silence]
sw3626B-ms98-a-0044 199.466000 200.896625 yes
sw3626B-ms98-a-0045 200.896625 203.705375 [silence]
sw3626B-ms98-a-0046 203.705375 207.243750 in the fuzzy logic direction
sw3626B-ms98-a-0047 207.243750 218.965375 [silence]
sw3626B-ms98-a-0048 218.965375 221.434750 yeah
sw3626B-ms98-a-0049 221.434750 225.049500 entering bad information of one sort or another and
sw3626B-ms98-a-0050 225.049500 226.941875 [silence]
sw3626B-ms98-a-0051 226.941875 228.327250 yeah

sw3626B-ms98-a-0053 230.955500 232.433125 uh-huh
sw3626B-ms98-a-0054 232.433125 236.400750 [silence]
sw3626B-ms98-a-0055 236.400750 246.393500 uh yeah well th[e]- what the computer well the CET program seems to be so far is just a broad based specialized from
sw3626B-ms98-a-0056 246.393500 253.885625 you get programming a f[air]- fair amount of programming you get uh hardware you get uh
sw3626B-ms98-a-0057 253.885625 255.786875 [silence]
sw3626B-ms98-a-0058 255.786875 259.148250 more or less uh
sw3626B-ms98-a-0059 259.148250 264.274500 [vocalized-noise] you get basic electronics courses that uh deal with
sw3626B-ms98-a-0060 264.274500 278.119500 you know not only the digital circuitry but uh you know power supplies and and uh just the whole gamut but mostly towards uh computer electronics
sw3626B-ms98-a-0061 278.119500 290.749125 so the idea is that um you can go in a variety of directions from CET major but i s[ay]- i have more fun with the hardware than i do with the software
sw3626B-ms98-a-0062 290.749125 297.113125 so you know i pretty much plan on i mean so far i'm planning to go in the engineering direction
sw3626B-ms98-a-0063 297.113125 298.530000 [silence]
