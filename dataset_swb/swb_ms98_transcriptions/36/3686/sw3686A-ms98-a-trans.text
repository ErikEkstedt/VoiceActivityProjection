sw3686A-ms98-a-0002 0.063250 4.814875 say you did uh starters and Bendix springs such as that on an old one

sw3686A-ms98-a-0004 9.980625 11.343750 yeah

sw3686A-ms98-a-0006 16.972000 20.099750 she had to label everything what was she driving
sw3686A-ms98-a-0007 20.099750 21.156375 [silence]
sw3686A-ms98-a-0008 21.156375 22.574750 uh-huh
sw3686A-ms98-a-0009 22.574750 27.461500 [silence]
sw3686A-ms98-a-0010 27.461500 28.832750 yeah
sw3686A-ms98-a-0011 28.832750 31.954875 [silence]
sw3686A-ms98-a-0012 31.954875 36.551000 [noise] yeah Quadrajet not real easy to get rebuilt just right
sw3686A-ms98-a-0013 36.551000 37.599625 [silence]
sw3686A-ms98-a-0014 37.599625 38.825000 um
sw3686A-ms98-a-0015 38.825000 40.029750 [silence]
sw3686A-ms98-a-0016 40.029750 44.106875 [vocalized-noise] what were you replacing the starters and Bendix drives on
sw3686A-ms98-a-0017 44.106875 51.096875 [silence]
sw3686A-ms98-a-0018 51.096875 57.630875 yeah did you replace just the uh the Bendix on the Chrysler station wagon or the whole starter
sw3686A-ms98-a-0019 57.630875 60.330375 [silence]
sw3686A-ms98-a-0020 60.330375 63.071250 yeah the starters are kind of fragile
sw3686A-ms98-a-0021 63.071250 65.193250 especially_1 if you need a tune up
sw3686A-ms98-a-0022 65.193250 71.716500 [silence]
sw3686A-ms98-a-0023 71.716500 80.525500 yeah well i[f]- i[f]- if they start real easy you know you just hit the key and it starts up and when it's properly tuned up that starter will last for a long time
sw3686A-ms98-a-0024 80.525500 85.886125 see they built that starter so it'd fit every V-8 and all the slant sixes
sw3686A-ms98-a-0025 85.886125 89.370375 that they built in like thirty five years
sw3686A-ms98-a-0026 89.370375 97.586000 they all take the exact same starter they'll interchange completely i mean completely one starter will fit all of them_1
sw3686A-ms98-a-0027 97.586000 105.454375 so they've got a whole lot of torque but to do that th[ey]- did uh they use an underdrive system where they geared it down
sw3686A-ms98-a-0028 105.454375 107.803500 so its motor spins really fast
sw3686A-ms98-a-0029 107.803500 116.761750 so it's got to spin for very long it's kind of tough on the bushings usually what goes is the bushings you take a little time replace the bushings you still got a perfectly good starter
sw3686A-ms98-a-0030 116.761750 125.458750 but uh most places don't put don't rebuild them with with g[ood]- with good enough bushings so it's you know
sw3686A-ms98-a-0031 125.458750 131.454125 after you get rebuilt one you have a tendency to go through them_1 pretty quickly especially if you need a tune-up
sw3686A-ms98-a-0032 131.454125 132.482125 [silence]
sw3686A-ms98-a-0033 132.482125 135.512625 anyway what are you driving now
sw3686A-ms98-a-0034 135.512625 150.532875 [silence]
sw3686A-ms98-a-0035 150.532875 151.982625 that's good

sw3686A-ms98-a-0049 179.186375 186.271000 [noise] yeah right now without getting some of the sportier models uh the four cylinders aren't real peppy
sw3686A-ms98-a-0050 186.271000 187.275375 [silence]
sw3686A-ms98-a-0051 187.275375 188.922250 but uh

sw3686A-ms98-a-0053 192.389250 194.692750 [silence]
sw3686A-ms98-a-0054 194.692750 207.394000 uh see i've driven one im[port]- uh i drove a Volkswagen Beetle for a while [laughter-about] a month um in that month i think i put uh three oil coolers on it um
sw3686A-ms98-a-0055 207.394000 213.225250 every time i turned around i was having trouble with it everything else i ever owned was American built
sw3686A-ms98-a-0056 213.225250 220.824500 uh mostly older cars um i've been a mechanic well i worked starting working my father's service station when i was about uh
sw3686A-ms98-a-0057 220.824500 222.645375 twelve
sw3686A-ms98-a-0058 222.645375 225.869625 so i've been around cars a lot
sw3686A-ms98-a-0059 225.869625 229.694125 but uh driven a lot of old Pontiacs
sw3686A-ms98-a-0060 229.694125 241.524625 my first three cars were uh seventy model Pontiacs a GTO and a Bonneville and a station wagon and
sw3686A-ms98-a-0061 241.524625 246.437750 i had a couple of Chryslers had a Super B for a while with a four forty in it
sw3686A-ms98-a-0062 246.437750 248.459500 it a lot of fun 
sw3686A-ms98-a-0063 248.459500 250.199000 but uh
sw3686A-ms98-a-0064 250.199000 251.313875 [silence]
sw3686A-ms98-a-0065 251.313875 254.503375 i don't know gas mileage wasn't too bad i got about seventeen
sw3686A-ms98-a-0066 254.503375 260.654250 well till you got crazy with it you know you get the four barrel all worked up and suddenly it it it drops off fast but
sw3686A-ms98-a-0067 260.654250 267.207500 long as you didn't spin the tires too much or or spend too much time with the secondaries kicked in it it didn't do too bad on gas [noise]
sw3686A-ms98-a-0068 267.207500 269.778500 didn't have to work very hard to move the car around
sw3686A-ms98-a-0069 269.778500 274.686625 [silence]
sw3686A-ms98-a-0070 274.686625 276.863375 oh yeah yeah definitely
