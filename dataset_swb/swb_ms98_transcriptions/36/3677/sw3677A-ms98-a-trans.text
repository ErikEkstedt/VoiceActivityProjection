sw3677A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.534250 [noise]
sw3677A-ms98-a-0002 0.534250 2.283625 now are we off and run[ning]- 
sw3677A-ms98-a-0003 2.283625 9.140000 oh i was just saying i guess old age has a few compensations i don't have to plan as carefully as i used to but uh
sw3677A-ms98-a-0004 9.140000 14.851000 [silence]
sw3677A-ms98-a-0005 14.851000 23.609000 no i don't think so uh we have three children and we were able to put all three of them through college and um
sw3677A-ms98-a-0006 23.609000 25.322500 [silence]
sw3677A-ms98-a-0007 25.322500 27.024375 [laughter]
sw3677A-ms98-a-0008 27.024375 28.440125 [silence]
sw3677A-ms98-a-0009 28.440125 29.582625 yeah
sw3677A-ms98-a-0010 29.582625 35.911000 [silence]
sw3677A-ms98-a-0011 35.911000 37.203500 uh-huh
sw3677A-ms98-a-0012 37.203500 61.617125 [silence]
sw3677A-ms98-a-0013 61.617125 64.069500 uh well
sw3677A-ms98-a-0014 64.069500 65.075375 [silence]
sw3677A-ms98-a-0015 65.075375 70.279875 the only way if if you spend all you take in every month
sw3677A-ms98-a-0016 70.279875 73.910750 you're uh living beyond your means
sw3677A-ms98-a-0017 73.910750 75.357000 [laughter]
sw3677A-ms98-a-0018 75.357000 82.656000 and emergencies or what we could would consider an emergency uh always come up
sw3677A-ms98-a-0019 82.656000 89.168375 i i i don't care how how you how closely you think you figured and then planned something always comes up
sw3677A-ms98-a-0020 89.168375 99.708875 so uh when i i guess we started by necessity because we went to uh law school on my husband's GI Bill
sw3677A-ms98-a-0021 99.708875 103.882375 back in the days when uh the government paid
sw3677A-ms98-a-0022 103.882375 115.653875 uh the student's tuition and and bought books up to a certain amount plus uh gave the veteran a stipend we started off with ninety dollars a month and then a little bit later got up to a hundred and five dollars a month
sw3677A-ms98-a-0023 115.653875 126.866375 so there was no way that we could do except when we cashed our monthly stipend was to put twenty dollars a week in an envelope
sw3677A-ms98-a-0024 126.866375 133.940875 deciding that it was better to go without one day a week than for four days at the end of the month 
sw3677A-ms98-a-0025 133.940875 136.149000 and then uh later on
sw3677A-ms98-a-0026 136.149000 142.230500 [noise] when we got out of school my husband got recalled into the Air Force when the Korean mess came up
sw3677A-ms98-a-0027 142.230500 143.669500 and uh
sw3677A-ms98-a-0028 143.669500 144.718375 [silence]
sw3677A-ms98-a-0029 144.718375 149.675000 so we had already established the envelope habit and uh
sw3677A-ms98-a-0030 149.675000 150.920000 [silence]
sw3677A-ms98-a-0031 150.920000 153.872875 no no no this was our weekly budget
sw3677A-ms98-a-0032 153.872875 164.695000 but uh we realized very early on that if we were going to have money to buy cars and that sort of thing that we would have to save up beforehand
sw3677A-ms98-a-0033 164.695000 166.898375 so uh
sw3677A-ms98-a-0034 166.898375 168.005625 [silence]
sw3677A-ms98-a-0035 168.005625 169.857625 we uh
sw3677A-ms98-a-0036 169.857625 178.958375 uh began uh in nineteen fifty uh to pay cash for everything we bought a car in nineteen fifty and paid it off in three months
sw3677A-ms98-a-0037 178.958375 181.628625 so since then except for a house
sw3677A-ms98-a-0038 181.628625 192.322875 houses we've paid cash for everything and uh to illustrate how well that works so that you have the opportunity to take care of special pricing
sw3677A-ms98-a-0039 192.322875 199.005875 uh our headquarters was transferred from South Carolina to Texas one time
sw3677A-ms98-a-0040 199.005875 204.000750 and because Texas gas was much much cheaper to cook with than electricity
sw3677A-ms98-a-0041 204.000750 210.036625 this one couple that we were transferred with uh bought a gas stove
sw3677A-ms98-a-0042 210.036625 214.624500 a very simplified gas stove for a hundred and forty some odd dollars
sw3677A-ms98-a-0043 214.624500 222.902625 we had uh in storage and used uh just a little teeny gas stove but after we got to Waco
sw3677A-ms98-a-0044 222.902625 229.745125 we saw an ad in the paper one day where a lady who had uh was moving into a house with a built in oven had
sw3677A-ms98-a-0045 229.745125 238.896750 the very best stove that Sears made at the time with two ovens a grill in the middle on top clock all the fancy amenities
sw3677A-ms98-a-0046 238.896750 241.483375 and we were able to buy it for a hundred dollars
sw3677A-ms98-a-0047 241.483375 243.656625 because we had the cash
sw3677A-ms98-a-0048 243.656625 245.898500 and uh uh
sw3677A-ms98-a-0049 245.898500 247.222625 the
sw3677A-ms98-a-0050 247.222625 248.639750 yeah
sw3677A-ms98-a-0051 248.639750 251.533125 [silence]
sw3677A-ms98-a-0052 251.533125 252.651125 uh-huh
sw3677A-ms98-a-0053 252.651125 256.220500 [silence]
sw3677A-ms98-a-0054 256.220500 257.618250 yeah
sw3677A-ms98-a-0055 257.618250 265.900625 [silence]
sw3677A-ms98-a-0056 265.900625 273.369125 no unfortunately we have not except for one daughter-in-law and uh [laughter] rise up and call her blessed every day
sw3677A-ms98-a-0057 273.369125 285.233375 uh for some reason or other my husband didn't see fit to give the boys a meaningful allowance he just felt he had to keep con[trol]- control of the purse strings
sw3677A-ms98-a-0058 285.233375 290.136000 and uh when they went off to college they had never really budgeted
sw3677A-ms98-a-0059 290.136000 296.689500 and uh that that was a big mistake so even though you know your children are going to make mistakes
sw3677A-ms98-a-0060 296.689500 299.522000 uh i don't i don't know how to tell you
