sw3680B-ms98-a-0002 1.684000 14.381625 okay well i'm a Vietnam era veteran and uh i was uh uh fortunate not to have to serve in the theater however uh m[y]- my support roll in the service was to support those in the theater of operation
sw3680B-ms98-a-0003 14.381625 18.079875 uh i'm of the old school that believes that um
sw3680B-ms98-a-0004 18.079875 24.394125 the uh uh contracts that we made back years ago uh needed to be honored
sw3680B-ms98-a-0005 24.394125 31.244125 however uh i think we could've executed the war and gotten it over a whole lot quicker
sw3680B-ms98-a-0006 31.244125 42.913625 oh but those are my personal thoughts and i think that if we'd let the generals run the war like we let the generals run World War Two we'd have got it over a whole lot quicker and lost a lot fewer people
sw3680B-ms98-a-0007 42.913625 53.527250 but as it was the politicians ran the the Korean conflict and ultimately the Vietnam thing and we managed to come out uh losers all way around
sw3680B-ms98-a-0008 53.527250 66.265500 and so this is what trigger[ed]- ultimately triggered the us uh uh the United States [vocalized-noise] per se being uh deciding to get out of the role of world policeman your views
sw3680B-ms98-a-0009 66.265500 75.620625 [silence]
sw3680B-ms98-a-0010 75.620625 82.236250 well we got into it because of a SEATO agreement back just right after World War Two
sw3680B-ms98-a-0011 82.236250 92.049125 that uh we pledged a mutual um uh defense of of the South Vietnamese
sw3680B-ms98-a-0012 92.049125 103.253500 and as it turned out they were in a civil war one with another and really [laughter-we] i i question us you know now of course uh hindsight is all too clear um
sw3680B-ms98-a-0013 103.253500 111.363250 so [noise] we're we we have to have to deal with with the uh situation as as we played it but
sw3680B-ms98-a-0014 111.363250 115.635375 [silence]
sw3680B-ms98-a-0015 115.635375 120.089500 i [laughter] don't get me started on those people
sw3680B-ms98-a-0016 120.089500 129.535250 you know before sh[e]- before Jane Fonda did did what she did i thought she was a wonderful person but after uh uh well
sw3680B-ms98-a-0017 129.535250 138.751125 [vocalized-noise] i- i just don't have anything want anything to do with her anymore because you support uh you support your government
sw3680B-ms98-a-0018 138.751125 140.151750 [silence]
sw3680B-ms98-a-0019 140.151750 146.947250 uh okay right or wrong i don't think is is we can determine whether we were right or wrong
sw3680B-ms98-a-0020 146.947250 159.963125 because [vocalized-noise] you're you're having to deal with a[gain]- again uh i think we could've made a different agreement back in for[ties]- the fort[ies]- the late forties era that would've kept out of there
sw3680B-ms98-a-0021 159.963125 161.746000 [silence]
sw3680B-ms98-a-0022 161.746000 162.969750 so
sw3680B-ms98-a-0023 162.969750 171.053750 [silence]
sw3680B-ms98-a-0024 171.053750 174.863000 can you hold just s[econd]- second Terry one moment please 
sw3680B-ms98-a-0025 174.863000 176.990875 [noise]
sw3680B-ms98-a-0026 176.990875 192.813125 [silence]
sw3680B-ms98-a-0027 192.813125 194.829500 sorry for the delay
sw3680B-ms98-a-0028 194.829500 200.234875 uh yeah this is the uh the the uh the mutual defense thing
sw3680B-ms98-a-0029 200.234875 202.941500 was [vocalized-noise] we we
sw3680B-ms98-a-0030 202.941500 208.363125 yeah it was complicated and i don't think everybody knows the whole situation i don't
sw3680B-ms98-a-0031 208.363125 216.888500 but from what i can gather is we went and said yeah we will help the uh South Vietnamese
sw3680B-ms98-a-0032 216.888500 223.253500 uh should they ask well the French went in and tried their old style warfare and uh
sw3680B-ms98-a-0033 223.253500 225.641625 got soundly thrashed
sw3680B-ms98-a-0034 225.641625 228.039750 and we didn't do a whole lot better
sw3680B-ms98-a-0035 228.039750 232.414750 [silence]
sw3680B-ms98-a-0036 232.414750 242.380750 well yeah that was the old French colony but see the French the French were our uh allies in NATO and they're also our allies in SEATO
sw3680B-ms98-a-0037 242.380750 249.070750 which was the South East Asia Treaty Organization which has since been a[bandoned]- disbanded as far as i know
sw3680B-ms98-a-0038 249.070750 254.332875 you know NATO is is on the way of being disbanded uh
sw3680B-ms98-a-0039 254.332875 256.679125 but uh
sw3680B-ms98-a-0040 256.679125 258.684000 the
sw3680B-ms98-a-0041 258.684000 269.677000 yeah the Fren[ch]- yeah we went in as an ally to the French and says yeah we'll we'll help you out if you get in a bind well they got in a bind and says we don't wanna you know play anymore
sw3680B-ms98-a-0042 269.677000 275.683000 so uh we we kind of we kind of got st[arted]- got the ball rolling ourselves
sw3680B-ms98-a-0043 275.683000 281.229625 versus a bunch of top secret silly organi[zations]- uh um
