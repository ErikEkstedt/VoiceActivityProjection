sw3607B-ms98-a-0004 12.810875 16.020875 [silence]
sw3607B-ms98-a-0005 16.020875 20.885125 yes uh it looks like i'm gonna have to get up there again because_1 we may have a leak
sw3607B-ms98-a-0006 20.885125 23.976375 [silence]
sw3607B-ms98-a-0007 23.976375 32.898125 we've been getting quite a bit maybe not quite as bad as some of the folks down around San Antonio but uh well i'm right uh Plano is just north of Dallas
sw3607B-ms98-a-0008 32.898125 38.862750 and uh there are parts of downtown or near downtown Dallas are under water right now i guess i saw on the news
sw3607B-ms98-a-0009 38.862750 42.465125 [silence]
sw3607B-ms98-a-0010 42.465125 47.197625 well we're up uh we're north in um
sw3607B-ms98-a-0011 47.197625 54.740125 oh about uh i don't know uh eighty to a hundred miles uh south of the Oklahoma line i guess
sw3607B-ms98-a-0012 54.740125 59.256375 [silence]
sw3607B-ms98-a-0013 59.256375 67.354875 uh we did have a little bit of rain yesterday so far we haven't had any today and uh i suppose that means i should be uh
sw3607B-ms98-a-0014 67.354875 74.138125 getting up there to look at that uh shingle but uh i had something else planned today so i guess i'll let it go awhile
sw3607B-ms98-a-0015 74.138125 75.681375 [silence]
sw3607B-ms98-a-0016 75.681375 79.193875 they're uh no they're uh [vocalized-noise] uh wood shake
sw3607B-ms98-a-0017 79.193875 81.223125 [silence]
sw3607B-ms98-a-0018 81.223125 83.014875 yeah [laughter]
sw3607B-ms98-a-0019 83.014875 86.712625 [silence]
sw3607B-ms98-a-0020 86.712625 100.125125 no i uh as a matter of fact we've never had a leak actually yet now this we just bought the house last year and um uh just before we took possession of it we had a fellow go up there and do whatever needed to be done on the shingles so 
sw3607B-ms98-a-0021 100.125125 103.333250 i've just recently had to start looking at it myself
sw3607B-ms98-a-0022 103.333250 110.761625 so it's a small problem so far but i guess you just have to keep on top of it what kind of roof do you have
sw3607B-ms98-a-0023 110.761625 113.029875 [silence]
sw3607B-ms98-a-0024 113.029875 114.580875 oh
sw3607B-ms98-a-0025 114.580875 119.066625 well then you don't have to do too much wi[th]- [laughter]
sw3607B-ms98-a-0026 119.066625 120.961875 uh-huh
sw3607B-ms98-a-0027 120.961875 125.100500 [silence]
sw3607B-ms98-a-0028 125.100500 129.853000 oh it's pretty steep um parts of it are steeper than others
sw3607B-ms98-a-0029 129.853000 132.187500 [silence]
sw3607B-ms98-a-0030 132.187500 141.123625 well uh [laughter] you wear uh shoes with good traction and [vocalized-noise] and and try to remember where you are at all times [laughter]
sw3607B-ms98-a-0031 141.123625 143.779000 [silence]
sw3607B-ms98-a-0032 143.779000 148.123750 and remember to yell Geronimo if uh all else fails
sw3607B-ms98-a-0033 148.123750 160.873750 [silence]
sw3607B-ms98-a-0034 160.873750 164.177250 it's actually just twelve years old now
sw3607B-ms98-a-0035 164.177250 174.952875 yeah it um this part of the country actually they [laughter] they say that when the house is uh fifteen it's already old but uh if you take good care of it
sw3607B-ms98-a-0036 174.952875 177.086375 thing is we've um
sw3607B-ms98-a-0037 177.086375 181.709500 the main thing that we've had with this house recently has been some um
sw3607B-ms98-a-0038 181.709500 193.199375 uh s[quirming]- squirming i call it of the foundation we're just on a concrete slab you know but uh the soil right under this is a clay and it um
sw3607B-ms98-a-0039 193.199375 199.679625 well it uh depending on it's moisture content it either swells up or shrinks
sw3607B-ms98-a-0040 199.679625 205.099000 and um course the soil right under the slab retains it's moisture a lot longer
sw3607B-ms98-a-0041 205.099000 215.416500 and so during the dry season you have to water the foundation to keep your foundation from uh from uh drooping and um
sw3607B-ms98-a-0042 215.416500 220.050125 but anytime there's a change in the weather like the temperature uh
sw3607B-ms98-a-0043 220.050125 227.940375 drastic changes in temperature or in uh moisture uh you get little spider web cracks all around uh windows and doors
sw3607B-ms98-a-0044 227.940375 229.418750 [silence]
sw3607B-ms98-a-0045 229.418750 236.281500 well usually what you do is just wait until you think it's stopped and then you patch them_1 up [laughter]
sw3607B-ms98-a-0046 236.281500 239.202000 [silence]
sw3607B-ms98-a-0047 239.202000 242.840125 uh well this is all uh it's all drywall
sw3607B-ms98-a-0048 242.840125 245.638500 uh i think with um [noise]
sw3607B-ms98-a-0049 245.638500 248.779375 yeah right
sw3607B-ms98-a-0050 248.779375 256.848625 but uh somehow or other that does manage to uh show these little cracks i don't know quite how that works maybe it isn't drywall
sw3607B-ms98-a-0051 256.848625 258.916125 i don't really know
sw3607B-ms98-a-0052 258.916125 261.333125 yeah i think it is
sw3607B-ms98-a-0053 261.333125 267.543125 [silence]
sw3607B-ms98-a-0054 267.543125 269.896875 i expect that's what it is yeah
sw3607B-ms98-a-0055 269.896875 273.745875 [silence]
sw3607B-ms98-a-0056 273.745875 279.418375 yeah i think that's the way this is done fortunately we haven't had any real big holes in it yet so i
sw3607B-ms98-a-0057 279.418375 290.379625 [silence]
sw3607B-ms98-a-0058 290.379625 295.444875 yes well the uh previous owner had a major problem with it because um
sw3607B-ms98-a-0059 295.444875 298.306000 oh probably a variety of things uh his neighbor used to ha[ve]-
