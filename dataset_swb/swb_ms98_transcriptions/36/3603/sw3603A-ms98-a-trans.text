sw3603A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 4.473750 [noise] well what do you think about uh funding yeah
sw3603A-ms98-a-0002 4.473750 12.354875 [silence]
sw3603A-ms98-a-0003 12.354875 21.957875 i do too um i have been a a big supporter for [noise] i guess since the third grade when i uh watched uh
sw3603A-ms98-a-0004 21.957875 33.710000 uh John Glenn orbit the Earth you know and uh been fascinated with it since then and i think it's just in a uh just a great source of national pride
sw3603A-ms98-a-0005 33.710000 44.508125 [silence]
sw3603A-ms98-a-0006 44.508125 46.038875 yeah
sw3603A-ms98-a-0007 46.038875 59.291000 [silence]
sw3603A-ms98-a-0008 59.291000 72.536125 well [noise] you know whenever i i look at uh the way our our our federal dollars are spent and uh really the NASA program takes
sw3603A-ms98-a-0009 72.536125 79.921000 a fairly small amount of that if you look at a percentage basis and i think that there are so many other areas that we are
sw3603A-ms98-a-0010 79.921000 93.541875 uh throwing money away that really have you know w[e]- we don't see anything for it and i can see i can see something from my tax dollars uh in the space program and uh i don't know i i
sw3603A-ms98-a-0011 93.541875 104.687625 i for one wouldn't wouldn't take a dime away from them_1 if anything i think i would like to see uh uh more money spent uh uh with NASA and less on other programs
sw3603A-ms98-a-0012 104.687625 108.060250 [silence]
sw3603A-ms98-a-0013 108.060250 114.538500 yeah but uh no i used to uh [noise] you know think that golly it'd be great to uh
sw3603A-ms98-a-0014 114.538500 126.869500 to fly on on the space shuttle of course that was up until the Challenger incident and uh really brought to to light that you know and uh really we had lead we had led a charmed life uh
sw3603A-ms98-a-0015 126.869500 138.440875 right right and just you know in relying you know just saying gosh you know we really are just super duper and then you know that proved hey uh we were fallible and i mean it was one of those things where it was tragic and yet
sw3603A-ms98-a-0016 138.440875 151.787750 eventually it had to happen i mean it had gotten to the point that you know the space shuttle launches were just so commonplace [noise] and yeah and and you know it just uh you know relegated to the second or third page of the newspaper uh 
sw3603A-ms98-a-0017 151.787750 163.465625 but still [vocalized-noise] i mean it's hard for me to imagine that um spaceflight is something that is going to really be within our reach uh you know or or commonplace for the average person i mean 
sw3603A-ms98-a-0018 163.465625 166.896500 [silence]
sw3603A-ms98-a-0019 166.896500 172.108250 yeah i w[ell]- well i i tell you i've flown practically everything but the space shuttle
sw3603A-ms98-a-0020 172.108250 181.223000 and uh i it would be hard for me to turn it down if if there was if the offer was there uh they say it it really is something the the one of the things though that i think that's so
sw3603A-ms98-a-0021 181.223000 186.098625 incredibly valuable about the space shuttle we have here in Houston uh the IMAX theater
sw3603A-ms98-a-0022 186.098625 198.762625 uh that has you know this tremendous huge screen and they had a program called uh Planet Earth that was made up of um just about an hour show and it was all uh footage filmed from outer space of Earth
sw3603A-ms98-a-0023 198.762625 203.809125 and it was spectacular and it it i think that it helps
sw3603A-ms98-a-0024 203.809125 211.993500 you know perhaps and i hope that it does makes more and more people aware of you know the fact that uh we live on a fragile
sw3603A-ms98-a-0025 211.993500 221.983625 you know a fragile planet and that it it's important to take a global view and what better way to to do that than to to see it up on Earth i mean from outer space 
sw3603A-ms98-a-0026 221.983625 228.395875 [silence]
sw3603A-ms98-a-0027 228.395875 230.348500 yeah
sw3603A-ms98-a-0028 230.348500 236.048250 well and then again well and then again it's one of the few things that we continue to lead in
sw3603A-ms98-a-0029 236.048250 241.729500 and and i hate to see us sacrifice something that we've got uh an edge on but um
sw3603A-ms98-a-0030 241.729500 247.948750 [noise] one of the things that was interesting out of that out of that program that they said that uh they compared um uh
sw3603A-ms98-a-0031 247.948750 257.066250 photographs of different parts of the ocean over uh the course of uh fifteen or twenty years uh from previous uh uh flights 
sw3603A-ms98-a-0032 257.066250 266.725875 and uh they could document the change in the color of the ocean and whether that had to do with a change in plankton because of the ozone or the the rising temperature or whatever but um yeah
sw3603A-ms98-a-0033 266.725875 274.187500 but it was interesting that you know you could they could even see from up there how we're changing our environment in in such you know an incredibly short time
sw3603A-ms98-a-0034 274.187500 282.702375 [silence]
sw3603A-ms98-a-0035 282.702375 284.241000 yeah
sw3603A-ms98-a-0036 284.241000 288.326000 [silence]
sw3603A-ms98-a-0037 288.326000 299.074000 it's awesome whenever i i i've read the stories about and you know and heard things about some of the the the things that the satellites can do from up there as far as photography's concerned i mean it's they said that they can
