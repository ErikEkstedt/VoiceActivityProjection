sw3625B-ms98-a-0046 166.242875 172.511000 make sure that that make sure that that what you put on paper will work and then put it to wood

sw3625B-ms98-a-0049 180.376875 193.335625 you can go to a like a a furniture shop and a stereo cabinet like i built only a lot smaller would cost you probably in the neighborhood of forty to fifty dollars
sw3625B-ms98-a-0050 193.335625 196.177875 i think i spent
sw3625B-ms98-a-0051 196.177875 199.713375 a total of maybe fifteen to twenty
sw3625B-ms98-a-0052 199.713375 201.127625 yeah
sw3625B-ms98-a-0053 201.127625 206.213750 and and had wood left over and you know to to use for other other things

sw3625B-ms98-a-0055 207.548000 214.438625 and it and it and i and i got my when i made it it's made to the specifications that i wanted because i have an oversize stereo
sw3625B-ms98-a-0056 214.438625 219.401625 that wouldn't fit in most newer stereo cabinets because they make all those
sw3625B-ms98-a-0057 219.401625 221.503000 [silence]
sw3625B-ms98-a-0058 221.503000 227.462500 yeah they make all those smaller components now and this is a stereo that i've had since 
sw3625B-ms98-a-0059 227.462500 230.134875 i think about nineteen eighty
sw3625B-ms98-a-0060 230.134875 231.407500 so
sw3625B-ms98-a-0061 231.407500 232.479875 [silence]
sw3625B-ms98-a-0062 232.479875 239.550625 that that kind of thing works out to your advantage as well you can make it to to fit your design instead of whatever they give you
sw3625B-ms98-a-0063 239.550625 244.116875 [silence]
