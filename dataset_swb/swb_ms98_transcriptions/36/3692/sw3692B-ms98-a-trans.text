sw3692B-ms98-a-0003 2.589250 5.929250 i'm sure well actually probably any government but
sw3692B-ms98-a-0004 5.929250 9.110125 the federal one's the big one [laughter]
sw3692B-ms98-a-0005 9.110125 15.244625 so uh so what do you what do you think in the short term we should be doing to to improve it
sw3692B-ms98-a-0006 15.244625 29.292000 [silence]
sw3692B-ms98-a-0007 29.292000 30.620375 right

sw3692B-ms98-a-0013 48.746375 50.030000 [noise]
sw3692B-ms98-a-0014 50.030000 59.434000 huh ah yeah i'm getting pretty kind of disgusted with the uh um the [vocalized-noise] you know the fact that they're counting um a reduced deficit as being some big step
sw3692B-ms98-a-0015 59.434000 66.399000 right i mean first of all we're we're we were about_1 ready to hit the largest defi[cit]- i mean this proposed budget has the largest deficit ever
sw3692B-ms98-a-0016 66.399000 76.949000 and two a deficit is i mean the deficit is only uh is [vocalized-noise] as as far from a balanced budget you reduce the deficit you you're still not you're still not you're still overspending 
sw3692B-ms98-a-0017 76.949000 82.155000 right i mean it's it's just the amount that you're overspending and and this is you know and for some reason
sw3692B-ms98-a-0018 82.155000 91.939125 uh the way that the reporting is going on now it seems like like the uh the goal is to reduce the deficit to some you know still outrageous amount um
sw3692B-ms98-a-0019 91.939125 97.042250 [noise] yeah i i i think in the long term something is going to have to be done with uh
sw3692B-ms98-a-0020 97.042250 99.182625 sort of the the uh
sw3692B-ms98-a-0021 99.182625 104.085625 well i mean it's it seems to be kind of inherent in the political process right that you've got
sw3692B-ms98-a-0022 104.085625 112.817875 um people you know trying to trying to corner money for their state or for their constituents so that they can get reelected
sw3692B-ms98-a-0023 112.817875 116.988625 and uh there isn't any sort of overall
sw3692B-ms98-a-0024 116.988625 120.780375 accountability and and uh
sw3692B-ms98-a-0025 120.780375 127.620125 i don't know i gue[ss]- i suppose that that that the only kind of solution ultimately that we're gonna have is is is
sw3692B-ms98-a-0026 127.620125 138.023000 exposure and information and and i don't know that that in in general the American people are that interested you know to listen to to as much uh uh
sw3692B-ms98-a-0027 138.023000 143.882250 you know i mean you're gonna have to know what people are doing and uh you know and how
sw3692B-ms98-a-0028 143.882250 152.183375 and how how partisan and how [laughter] and how self interested their their motives are and and take it to task for it
sw3692B-ms98-a-0029 152.183375 158.412500 because uh it's not gonna get solved if you know if people are still trying to you know like besides like you were saying you said you know where you
sw3692B-ms98-a-0030 158.412500 166.578125 uh hey we just you know we just cut defense let me grab some of this money for my state now and then we can throw in some highway bill or we can throw in some you know some other kind of thing
sw3692B-ms98-a-0031 166.578125 171.576875 and uh it's a pretty vicious uh vicious cycle
sw3692B-ms98-a-0032 171.576875 173.368875 i don't know
sw3692B-ms98-a-0033 173.368875 177.632500 [silence]
sw3692B-ms98-a-0034 177.632500 185.284250 that yeah that's being batted around i uh my my dad was always a pro[ponent]- a proponent of that he uh he felt that that would
sw3692B-ms98-a-0035 185.284250 191.902625 get people involved who were who were interested in being public servants as opposed to personal servants yeah
sw3692B-ms98-a-0036 191.902625 193.300250 yeah
sw3692B-ms98-a-0037 193.300250 201.375500 [silence]

sw3692B-ms98-a-0049 248.103125 254.509000 yeah [noise] yeah i think i think that that's probably right because in terms of long term you you just got to get people
sw3692B-ms98-a-0050 254.509000 259.658875 um i mean [vocalized-noise] at one point at least on a local level um
sw3692B-ms98-a-0051 259.658875 269.508625 going into politics is you know what you're doing is is really trying to serve the community right i mean you don't expect to make any money out of it you know maybe you gain a little bit of local fame but
sw3692B-ms98-a-0052 269.508625 278.881250 but it's uh you put in a lot of work in exchange for that and and i don't have the feeling that national level politicians are are at all like that you know
sw3692B-ms98-a-0053 278.881250 290.231125 yeah and uh you know and i think that the the the problem with having you know junior people coming in all the time is that you end up kind of wasting a lot of time with uh
sw3692B-ms98-a-0054 290.231125 295.635500 you know with in[ept]- inept politicians or people who don't know how to deal with the pub[lic]-
sw3692B-ms98-a-0055 295.635500 298.626000 but on the other hand maybe that's in a lot of them_1
