sw3692A-ms98-a-0005 13.874125 23.578875 well i saw a program on it recently and and it said everywh[ere]- time they cut you know like fifty five million dollars on a certain thing
sw3692A-ms98-a-0006 23.578875 24.960875 then
sw3692A-ms98-a-0007 24.960875 32.483875 they brag about how much money they cut and then they go and spend that money somewhere else and that's why the budget is never balanced
sw3692A-ms98-a-0008 32.483875 41.123750 The Gramm Rudman Act didn't solve the problem they just take all the money that they say they cut and they spend it somewhere else
sw3692A-ms98-a-0009 41.123750 51.117750 or they you know they pad out their staff or you know spend it in bounced checks at the commissary or

sw3692A-ms98-a-0021 189.854750 201.788625 right and and don't let them_1 come back and and uh keep Congress to um two terms and two years a piece and then it'll be overturning and they won't have the same people there all the time
sw3692A-ms98-a-0022 201.788625 216.336000 and then all the special interest groups will have to renegotiate all of their their payoffs and kickbacks and and that'll keep them busy enough so that they won't have as much influence
sw3692A-ms98-a-0023 216.336000 223.238750 and because_1 that's one of the things one of the biggest things is that um the fact that
sw3692A-ms98-a-0024 223.238750 234.042125 they're always trying to lean somebody toward one way or ano[ther]- whether it's the oil companies or the automotive companies and like the air bag thing the air bag came out what twenty years ago
sw3692A-ms98-a-0025 234.042125 241.970125 and only now they're getting it put in cars you know and the oil companies aren't really aren't responsible you know
sw3692A-ms98-a-0026 241.970125 248.777875 the Valdez proved that and then the government doesn't jump on them_1 hard enough to make them_1 do anything it should've been done immediately
