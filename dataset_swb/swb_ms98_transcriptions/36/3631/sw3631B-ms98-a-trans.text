sw3631B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 2.972625 [silence]
sw3631B-ms98-a-0002 2.972625 7.150750 yes it's been some years ago i haven't taught in the last twenty years
sw3631B-ms98-a-0003 7.150750 8.515500 [silence]
sw3631B-ms98-a-0004 8.515500 14.913875 i taught about half the time at the high school level and about half the time at the junior college level
sw3631B-ms98-a-0005 14.913875 18.008750 [silence]
sw3631B-ms98-a-0006 18.008750 21.410875 um business subjects
sw3631B-ms98-a-0007 21.410875 23.195875 [silence]
sw3631B-ms98-a-0008 23.195875 25.530000 do you have children in school
sw3631B-ms98-a-0009 25.530000 29.460375 [silence]
sw3631B-ms98-a-0010 29.460375 30.967625 um-hum
sw3631B-ms98-a-0011 30.967625 34.477875 [silence]
sw3631B-ms98-a-0012 34.477875 35.988750 yes
sw3631B-ms98-a-0013 35.988750 42.161000 [silence]
sw3631B-ms98-a-0014 42.161000 44.545000 uh
sw3631B-ms98-a-0015 44.545000 50.990375 well other than the fact that it it's not difficult enough and it doesn't last u[s]- long enough during the school year
sw3631B-ms98-a-0016 50.990375 64.896625 uh i one of the the big errors uh that was made over the years is passing children along when they hadn't really completed the get grade that they were in
sw3631B-ms98-a-0017 64.896625 69.942125 and allowing children to graduate from high school who couldn't read and write
sw3631B-ms98-a-0018 69.942125 73.760875 and cipher [laughter]
sw3631B-ms98-a-0019 73.760875 75.487875 oh
sw3631B-ms98-a-0020 75.487875 79.075875 when i taught at the uh junior college level
sw3631B-ms98-a-0021 79.075875 80.648500 um
sw3631B-ms98-a-0022 80.648500 81.901375 [silence]
sw3631B-ms98-a-0023 81.901375 91.521875 i taught uh business law at the sophomore level and we were on the quarter system so they had this was the last two quarters in the sophomore year so they had to
sw3631B-ms98-a-0024 91.521875 98.008750 think up something for me to teach at the uh front end of the in the fall
sw3631B-ms98-a-0025 98.008750 105.945125 so i taught a little course called office machines now if you keep in mind this was long before the days of the hand held computer calculator
sw3631B-ms98-a-0026 105.945125 110.028875 so we started off with a ten key adding machine
sw3631B-ms98-a-0027 110.028875 111.972125 and
sw3631B-ms98-a-0028 111.972125 117.354125 uh ah one of the first problems was to add three tenths
sw3631B-ms98-a-0029 117.354125 120.965375 and twenty four hundredths
sw3631B-ms98-a-0030 120.965375 130.071500 and invariably a substantial proportion of the class would come up with twenty seven hundredths
sw3631B-ms98-a-0031 130.071500 143.721875 so i would have to launch into a discussion of common denominator and explain that every figure that was entered into that ten key adding machine with two decimal places
sw3631B-ms98-a-0032 143.721875 153.398625 was a number divided by a hundred and in order to add three tenths to anything it had to be changed to thirty hundredths
sw3631B-ms98-a-0033 153.398625 154.816500 [silence]
sw3631B-ms98-a-0034 154.816500 169.522250 and uh the only criterion for getting into the junior college where i taught was being eighteen years of age uh having a high school diploma was not a prerequisite it was for some of the the curricula but it wasn't for the business curriculum
sw3631B-ms98-a-0035 169.522250 173.468625 [laughter-so] so [laughter-that's]
sw3631B-ms98-a-0036 173.468625 175.151500 i beg your pardon
sw3631B-ms98-a-0037 175.151500 176.984500 [silence]
sw3631B-ms98-a-0038 176.984500 183.849500 uh no it was not at that time uh to take courses all you had to be with eighteen years of age
sw3631B-ms98-a-0039 183.849500 185.016750 [silence]
sw3631B-ms98-a-0040 185.016750 189.802500 uh so uh
sw3631B-ms98-a-0041 189.802500 201.987250 the the new math i think ruined our math uh i was teaching at the high school level when it was being introduced to the seventh grade
sw3631B-ms98-a-0042 201.987250 209.541250 and eighth grade and uh i went to a lecture and the math teacher said well we used to teach
sw3631B-ms98-a-0043 209.541250 217.793000 business arithmetic at the seventh and eighth grade level but now we're going to teach the new math like how to to count in the binary counting system
sw3631B-ms98-a-0044 217.793000 230.028125 and uh uh the base twelve and that sort of thing and uh we're gonna teach the theory of mathematics and never mind percentage
sw3631B-ms98-a-0045 230.028125 233.686500 so um
sw3631B-ms98-a-0046 233.686500 246.733250 i i checked my my s[on]- my son was uh let's see when would he have been in eighth grade about oh in the middle sixties he would have been in the eighth grade and i checked his eighth grade math book
sw3631B-ms98-a-0047 246.733250 253.389125 and uh there were no perc[entage]- there were two pages devoted to percentage and ratio and proportion
sw3631B-ms98-a-0048 253.389125 262.223250 and in in his algebra book there were no fractions no percentages and course he proceeded on to geometry
sw3631B-ms98-a-0049 262.223250 268.871625 and um that sort of thing fortunately my boys have a very high aptitude in math
sw3631B-ms98-a-0050 268.871625 275.992000 but uh there's a a a great population out there that does not
sw3631B-ms98-a-0051 275.992000 280.433500 and uh so i went through this
sw3631B-ms98-a-0052 280.433500 281.647125 [silence]
sw3631B-ms98-a-0053 281.647125 286.088625 uh lecture of counting in the decimal counting system
sw3631B-ms98-a-0054 286.088625 290.656125 and i said if this doesn't make sense to you memorize it
sw3631B-ms98-a-0055 290.656125 293.711875 [laughter] [laughter-and] learn your {two-doms} [laughter]
sw3631B-ms98-a-0056 293.711875 296.584375 because_1 it's a percentage world out there
sw3631B-ms98-a-0057 296.584375 298.626000 [silence]
