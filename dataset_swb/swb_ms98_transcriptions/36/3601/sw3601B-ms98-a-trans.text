sw3601B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.563250 [noise]
sw3601B-ms98-a-0002 0.563250 17.832625 [silence]
sw3601B-ms98-a-0003 17.832625 23.346375 well i- i i can agree with what you say and of course uh
sw3601B-ms98-a-0004 23.346375 31.330625 in addition to what you mentioned uh you know i'd like to see them have some uh ha[ve]- more companies have like dental care
sw3601B-ms98-a-0005 31.330625 33.325875 and uh
sw3601B-ms98-a-0006 33.325875 38.567125 yeah and more benefits for uh working mothers uh uh
sw3601B-ms98-a-0007 38.567125 52.838000 i noticed here lately there's some companies have been providing what they kind of call an in-house day care center where the mothers can come and leave their uh children with somebody locally at the company and go to work and if something happens they're immediately there
sw3601B-ms98-a-0008 52.838000 54.086250 [silence]
sw3601B-ms98-a-0009 54.086250 61.521875 yeah i have a couple of teena[gers]- i have a couple of daughters uh one of which is married and has two two small sons and
sw3601B-ms98-a-0010 61.521875 67.675000 and they stay in a day care and and they have a lot of sickness because they're around the other children
sw3601B-ms98-a-0011 67.675000 76.726250 and it would be so nice if uh the company she worked for provided that uh you know in house or or nearby or
sw3601B-ms98-a-0012 76.726250 85.027250 now there is there is one benefit that uh is uh offered now um where they pay
sw3601B-ms98-a-0013 85.027250 89.958625 they pay they pay for hospitalization
sw3601B-ms98-a-0014 89.958625 98.204250 uh with funds uh before income tax funds uh before with funds that are not taxed
sw3601B-ms98-a-0015 98.204250 102.393000 and but i think that's more or less kind of in the group insurance field
sw3601B-ms98-a-0016 102.393000 103.719000 [silence]
sw3601B-ms98-a-0017 103.719000 106.561625 so that's a new innovation too for a benefit
sw3601B-ms98-a-0018 106.561625 110.022125 yeah
sw3601B-ms98-a-0019 110.022125 110.966125 uh-huh
sw3601B-ms98-a-0020 110.966125 112.936125 yeah that's true
sw3601B-ms98-a-0021 112.936125 118.869375 and uh let's see what other benefits do you have any others uh that you'd like to see
sw3601B-ms98-a-0022 118.869375 119.895000 [silence]
sw3601B-ms98-a-0023 119.895000 121.346750 how about uh
sw3601B-ms98-a-0024 121.346750 126.266250 [silence]
sw3601B-ms98-a-0025 126.266250 134.941750 yeah in the old days of course they didn't have any any benefits at all they preached job security but that that went out fast
sw3601B-ms98-a-0026 134.941750 140.116000 and uh so now days i guess funding takes par[t]- or rather uh
sw3601B-ms98-a-0027 140.116000 147.296375 uh your benefits are locked in after you're there with a company for five years but the benefits are so small
sw3601B-ms98-a-0028 147.296375 151.045500 and usually they're tied in with social security
sw3601B-ms98-a-0029 151.045500 153.416000 and uh it [vocalized-noise]
sw3601B-ms98-a-0030 153.416000 155.294250 [silence]
sw3601B-ms98-a-0031 155.294250 156.372500 yeah
sw3601B-ms98-a-0032 156.372500 167.936750 right and uh so uh even if you have benefits and you and then when you get to social security age they're not as great because they're tied in to social security benefits so you don't get both of them in full
sw3601B-ms98-a-0033 167.936750 173.850000 so it's hard today to live off of social security if you don't have your home paid for
sw3601B-ms98-a-0034 173.850000 176.103375 [silence]
sw3601B-ms98-a-0035 176.103375 177.397875 so uh
sw3601B-ms98-a-0036 177.397875 192.307250 [silence]
sw3601B-ms98-a-0037 192.307250 193.529750 um-hum
sw3601B-ms98-a-0038 193.529750 198.102000 [silence]
sw3601B-ms98-a-0039 198.102000 199.424500 i see
sw3601B-ms98-a-0040 199.424500 203.212625 [silence]
sw3601B-ms98-a-0041 203.212625 206.101250 well you know uh benefits uh
sw3601B-ms98-a-0042 206.101250 216.451875 are great and uh the more that a company can provide the better off we are but it's so hard now for companies to make a profit as you no doubt uh
sw3601B-ms98-a-0043 216.451875 221.092250 know you know most of our companies uh are losing their shirt
sw3601B-ms98-a-0044 221.092250 230.596750 going bankrupt and uh so some kind of system has to be devised were more [vocalized-noise] more competitive perhaps we've uh uh
sw3601B-ms98-a-0045 230.596750 244.908000 been uh we were too used to off time and all these benefits that are not uh taking care of us in our old age but we're getting immediate effect of them like for example like seven hour days -[a]nd
sw3601B-ms98-a-0046 244.908000 254.551875 and uh when in effect while we're young we ought to be working harder and come up with better benefits so that when we get older we have the uh
sw3601B-ms98-a-0047 254.551875 260.080250 we we have those benefits available to us in in a need that would make it easy for us in retirement
sw3601B-ms98-a-0048 260.080250 270.187875 uh you know social security again most of the young people today are paying in they they don't they don't have any any they don't believe that anything will be left over 
sw3601B-ms98-a-0049 270.187875 271.908000 when they get to retirement age
sw3601B-ms98-a-0050 271.908000 275.225250 course the old bank never gets out you know
sw3601B-ms98-a-0051 275.225250 276.645000 yeah
sw3601B-ms98-a-0052 276.645000 277.736000 [silence]
sw3601B-ms98-a-0053 277.736000 280.419875 uh-huh and uh so uh
sw3601B-ms98-a-0054 280.419875 289.355625 i guess uh we can make our dollar go lower and lower and lower until you get to zero and then everybody can say okay nobody has anything and start over again
sw3601B-ms98-a-0055 289.355625 293.915625 [silence]
sw3601B-ms98-a-0056 293.915625 295.101250 um-hum
sw3601B-ms98-a-0057 295.101250 297.162875 insurance costs are going up
sw3601B-ms98-a-0058 297.162875 298.562000 [silence]
