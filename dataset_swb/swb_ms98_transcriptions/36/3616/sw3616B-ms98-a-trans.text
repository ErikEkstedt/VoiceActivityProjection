sw3616B-ms98-a-0010 25.287625 31.820250 well what some of you have heard some of you haven't i think it's just it's it's pretty much every
sw3616B-ms98-a-0011 31.820250 39.208875 it's the most plausible theory that i guess um theories that they kind of pulled together in kind of a um
sw3616B-ms98-a-0012 39.208875 53.810625 pretty much an order pretty much i don't know it's kind of hard to describe i mean it's kind uh you have to kind of see it because it wasn't what i expected because i was thinking it's going to be just kind of a typical rundown of what you know you've heard the past you know ten years but um
sw3616B-ms98-a-0013 53.810625 62.792750 i think it's a great movie because uh you leave the uh movie thinking that you know the government actually was
sw3616B-ms98-a-0014 62.792750 73.360875 they they yeah i mean they you know they did there's always that cover up and that was in sixty you know sixty three so i mean uh twenty eight years later there's been
sw3616B-ms98-a-0015 73.360875 80.258125 there's so much more that they've done i mean that screw the American people around so it's it's a great movie
sw3616B-ms98-a-0016 80.258125 90.903000 and my family's in actuall[y]- my family's here tonight um and they're wanting to see it so i'm probably going to go see it again and i'm not one i usually don't like to see a movie you know twice but if it's
sw3616B-ms98-a-0017 90.903000 96.334250 gee that's a three hour and like twenty minute movie and i mean i want to see it again it's a great movie
sw3616B-ms98-a-0018 96.334250 97.895125 it's really good

sw3616B-ms98-a-0038 143.615750 153.705375 right it's about uh Bugsy Siegel who um pretty much started Flamingo out in Vegas he had like the vision of you know Vegas what it could be what it is today 
sw3616B-ms98-a-0039 153.705375 157.887625 at the time it was you know just a complete desert and
sw3616B-ms98-a-0040 157.887625 159.361125 pretty much
sw3616B-ms98-a-0041 159.361125 164.234000 yeah he had he was given a budget of like a million dollars to go out and build this Flamingo and 
sw3616B-ms98-a-0042 164.234000 172.137875 and they thought he was cra[zy]- it was a stupid idea and you know he built it but it cost like six million dollars because he had so many overruns and uh
sw3616B-ms98-a-0043 172.137875 177.500125 i mean there was nothing out there and they thought you know it was stupid so he got killed for it because you know he

sw3616B-ms98-a-0045 178.731000 188.200000 right and you know the the great thing is you know his six million dollar investment turned out to be a two hundred billion dollar return so
sw3616B-ms98-a-0046 188.200000 194.410500 and they killed him because they didn't think it was going to work out but it's a great movie it's a good movie Warren Beatty did a good job and
