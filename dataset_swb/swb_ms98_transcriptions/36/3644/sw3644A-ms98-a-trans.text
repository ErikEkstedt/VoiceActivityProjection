sw3644A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.203125 [noise]
sw3644A-ms98-a-0002 0.203125 3.492250 uh what are the capital punishment laws in your state
sw3644A-ms98-a-0003 3.492250 5.298000 or do you have it
sw3644A-ms98-a-0004 5.298000 10.642875 [silence]
sw3644A-ms98-a-0005 10.642875 22.078500 yeah uh or is it set for a specific crimes uh you know if you're convicted of this then it's the death penalty or or is it kind of just to the discretion under certain cases
sw3644A-ms98-a-0006 22.078500 31.839000 [silence]
sw3644A-ms98-a-0007 31.839000 32.946750 yeah
sw3644A-ms98-a-0008 32.946750 34.328500 [silence]
sw3644A-ms98-a-0009 34.328500 37.123500 yes i 
sw3644A-ms98-a-0010 37.123500 44.244500 i'm the same way i feel that capital punishment ought to be mandatory under certain crimes
sw3644A-ms98-a-0011 44.244500 59.367375 [silence]
sw3644A-ms98-a-0012 59.367375 63.144250 sounds like he'd grow old and die long before they get to kill him
sw3644A-ms98-a-0013 63.144250 65.089500 [silence]
sw3644A-ms98-a-0014 65.089500 67.916500 seventeen years on death row
sw3644A-ms98-a-0015 67.916500 74.634375 [silence]
sw3644A-ms98-a-0016 74.634375 76.304500 well uh
sw3644A-ms98-a-0017 76.304500 84.162625 since they reinstated the death penalty was it about seven or eight years ago i think the shortest anybody's waited has been two or three years
sw3644A-ms98-a-0018 84.162625 88.434875 i mean death penalty does not seem to be swift for anybody
sw3644A-ms98-a-0019 88.434875 91.052875 [silence]
sw3644A-ms98-a-0020 91.052875 92.064000 i
sw3644A-ms98-a-0021 92.064000 97.303250 so that's my understanding they do not have death penalty here right now um
sw3644A-ms98-a-0022 97.303250 98.313875 [silence]
sw3644A-ms98-a-0023 98.313875 99.659875 [vocalized-noise]
sw3644A-ms98-a-0024 99.659875 102.871375 it doesn't make any sense that they don't but they don't
sw3644A-ms98-a-0025 102.871375 104.354250 um
sw3644A-ms98-a-0026 104.354250 105.451750 [silence]
sw3644A-ms98-a-0027 105.451750 110.802500 and right now to the best of my understanding there is nothing afoot to get it reinstated
sw3644A-ms98-a-0028 110.802500 112.360875 uh
sw3644A-ms98-a-0029 112.360875 113.461000 [silence]
sw3644A-ms98-a-0030 113.461000 116.826375 personally i think there should be death penalty for
sw3644A-ms98-a-0031 116.826375 118.155625 uh
sw3644A-ms98-a-0032 118.155625 119.366125 [silence]
sw3644A-ms98-a-0033 119.366125 122.294500 the death penalty should be available almost any
sw3644A-ms98-a-0034 122.294500 124.606000 major violent crime
sw3644A-ms98-a-0035 124.606000 127.129250 and mandatory for murder
sw3644A-ms98-a-0036 127.129250 130.624750 [silence]
sw3644A-ms98-a-0037 130.624750 135.479125 it should be at least available as punishment for rape
sw3644A-ms98-a-0038 135.479125 137.573500 [silence]
sw3644A-ms98-a-0039 137.573500 148.337750 i think if it was a serious possibility of being executed for doing any of the major crimes that it would be a little less likely for people to commit them 
sw3644A-ms98-a-0040 148.337750 160.992625 [silence]
sw3644A-ms98-a-0041 160.992625 162.445375 yes
sw3644A-ms98-a-0042 162.445375 168.715500 [silence]
sw3644A-ms98-a-0043 168.715500 169.745250 yeah
sw3644A-ms98-a-0044 169.745250 180.149375 [silence]
sw3644A-ms98-a-0045 180.149375 183.157750 yeah and it
sw3644A-ms98-a-0046 183.157750 187.464250 i don't know i if i think also they should be
sw3644A-ms98-a-0047 187.464250 193.244000 they uh somebody providing drugs to someone that kills the person
sw3644A-ms98-a-0048 193.244000 198.350875 that ought to be considered murder and potential death penalty
sw3644A-ms98-a-0049 198.350875 200.173625 [silence]
sw3644A-ms98-a-0050 200.173625 201.619250 [noise] i uh
sw3644A-ms98-a-0051 201.619250 205.603625 they used to have the death penalty in my home state of West Virginia
sw3644A-ms98-a-0052 205.603625 207.335750 and
sw3644A-ms98-a-0053 207.335750 209.498625 there it was death by hanging
sw3644A-ms98-a-0054 209.498625 210.512125 [silence]
sw3644A-ms98-a-0055 210.512125 213.167000 uh but
sw3644A-ms98-a-0056 213.167000 214.938625 thirty four
sw3644A-ms98-a-0057 214.938625 216.050500 [silence]
sw3644A-ms98-a-0058 216.050500 221.651250 and it when they eliminated death penalty all kinds of things changed
sw3644A-ms98-a-0059 221.651250 226.016375 uh the rate of crime doubled within a[bout]- about a year or so
sw3644A-ms98-a-0060 226.016375 227.027500 [silence]
sw3644A-ms98-a-0061 227.027500 234.194000 and at that point when they were still hanging the uh state prison in Mountsville
sw3644A-ms98-a-0062 234.194000 235.767375 uh
sw3644A-ms98-a-0063 235.767375 240.973125 had a very small guard force and they had very little problems with their their inmates
sw3644A-ms98-a-0064 240.973125 242.159000 [silence]
sw3644A-ms98-a-0065 242.159000 248.110625 uh after they eliminated the death penalty shut down the gallows
sw3644A-ms98-a-0066 248.110625 253.158250 uh the place has gotten to the point where people who live in that area
sw3644A-ms98-a-0067 253.158250 263.103375 are all trying to get moved away it's become a maximum security prison they have had a whole lot more problems with breakouts with uh with violence within the the prison
sw3644A-ms98-a-0068 263.103375 264.390000 uh
sw3644A-ms98-a-0069 264.390000 269.207875 just the whole whole tenor of the thing has changed completely 
sw3644A-ms98-a-0070 269.207875 284.135750 [silence]
sw3644A-ms98-a-0071 284.135750 294.361375 who is it who said the death penalty doesn't deter cr[ime]- well i'm sure it doesn't much now because the death penalty is very seldom uh given and
sw3644A-ms98-a-0072 294.361375 298.850000 even then like you say it could be tw[enty]- twenty years between the time
