sw3666B-ms98-a-0020 46.819875 54.713250 well he's gonna give me an estimate and for ten dollars a week i don't see any reason for me to be doing it
sw3666B-ms98-a-0021 54.713250 56.893750 no for my yard
sw3666B-ms98-a-0022 56.893750 58.435250 [silence]

sw3666B-ms98-a-0025 62.425375 73.450375 or what i[s]- what does he charge not even that what does he charge me it's like next to nothing [vocalized-noise] it's ten because i it's forty a month but if there's five weeks i still pay forty
sw3666B-ms98-a-0026 73.450375 75.448375 [silence]
sw3666B-ms98-a-0027 75.448375 79.860500 well he won't pull weeds he says he'll spray them_1 but he won't pull them
sw3666B-ms98-a-0028 79.860500 87.514750 uh he won't cut them is what he won't do because he said with the rocks that it's too dangerous for him to take the
sw3666B-ms98-a-0029 87.514750 94.786625 the trimmer over the rocks and he's right that's true but he just says to keep spraying them so
sw3666B-ms98-a-0030 94.786625 98.871125 anyway Gene sprayed them once or twice for me so
sw3666B-ms98-a-0031 98.871125 100.420875 that was free
sw3666B-ms98-a-0032 100.420875 101.425000 [silence]
sw3666B-ms98-a-0033 101.425000 108.274125 no no there are two out front i thought i'd grab one of these days but i haven't bothered as i walk on by
sw3666B-ms98-a-0034 108.274125 113.105000 i start to pull the weeds in the rocks out front and
sw3666B-ms98-a-0035 113.105000 118.097125 all of a sudden i came cross this big clump of weeds and there was dog dirt in it
sw3666B-ms98-a-0036 118.097125 124.661500 and i threw the gloves in the trash bag that was out there and i left the whole thing and that was about a month ago
sw3666B-ms98-a-0037 124.661500 125.866500 [silence]
sw3666B-ms98-a-0038 125.866500 127.774125 i would rather a snake

sw3666B-ms98-a-0040 129.034000 135.513875 i just left the whole thing the bag is still out there because i haven't touched i haven't gone back over there it really made me mad

sw3666B-ms98-a-0047 156.603875 161.680000 they looked real pretty until about a week before Christmas then they started to die too
sw3666B-ms98-a-0048 161.680000 168.936250 so i don't think any of it comes back but i don't know maybe sometimes things do that aren't even supposed to

sw3666B-ms98-a-0055 184.110500 190.443375 they really grow nice and sometimes they're not supposed to come back but lots of times they do
sw3666B-ms98-a-0056 190.443375 191.738000 so
sw3666B-ms98-a-0057 191.738000 193.750625 we'll see
