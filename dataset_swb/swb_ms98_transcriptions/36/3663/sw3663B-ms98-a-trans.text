sw3663B-ms98-a-0048 224.521375 231.073375 i think uh all in all there are a lot worse climates than Dallas uh the weather
sw3663B-ms98-a-0049 231.073375 240.911500 you know does change fast and things do happen severely a few times a year but there's an awful lot of good weather too in between
sw3663B-ms98-a-0050 240.911500 243.498125 [silence]
sw3663B-ms98-a-0051 243.498125 253.833250 yeah and usually a lot of the spring months are really nice too after the last freeze and and when it begins to be in the sixties and seventies most of the time uh i like that
sw3663B-ms98-a-0052 253.833250 264.517500 particularly if i'm gonna be outdoors and doing uh outdoor activity hiking and things and that's nicer yeah i do quite a bit of that [laughter]
sw3663B-ms98-a-0053 264.517500 272.019750 think we're going in just a couple of weeks out to the east Texas and it is a little more humid out there than it is here so
sw3663B-ms98-a-0054 272.019750 274.078625 i guess we'll
sw3663B-ms98-a-0055 274.078625 279.805125 the only thing you have to watch out in this part of the country is during the change type seasons is the
sw3663B-ms98-a-0056 279.805125 292.142250 really severe storms that occasionally come through out here on the plains there's not much between us and the North Pole [laughter] and then when you get one of those tornado type
sw3663B-ms98-a-0057 292.142250 297.156875 systems through or severe hail or thunderstorms and it
sw3663B-ms98-a-0058 297.156875 298.626000 it [doen't/doesn't] seem to be
