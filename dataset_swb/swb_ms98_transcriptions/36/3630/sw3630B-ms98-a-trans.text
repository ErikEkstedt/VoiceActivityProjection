sw3630B-ms98-a-0003 3.282500 7.292625 well first off i have one daughter who's two
sw3630B-ms98-a-0004 7.292625 16.212500 and the question i think focused primarily on how people spend time with their children and is it adequate

sw3630B-ms98-a-0006 17.486750 20.343125 i think that's so varied depending on um
sw3630B-ms98-a-0007 20.343125 21.379625 [silence]
sw3630B-ms98-a-0008 21.379625 31.489625 what what your life is all about you know i i was just about to say priorities but it really has more to do with um the things that influence your life as opposed to just your priorities

sw3630B-ms98-a-0010 33.952375 37.922750 spend as much time as i can with my daughter my husband [laughter-so] 
sw3630B-ms98-a-0011 37.922750 40.482000 it's always a challenge um
sw3630B-ms98-a-0012 40.482000 49.023625 i think that probably we like to spend our time together doing um recreational things as much as possible [noise]
sw3630B-ms98-a-0013 49.023625 52.940000 [noise] i mean that's sort of obvious i guess when you have a young child anyway they're not
