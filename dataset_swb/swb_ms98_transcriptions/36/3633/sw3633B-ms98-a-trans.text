sw3633B-ms98-a-0013 65.992625 77.063500 [noise] but we did have Barbies we did have Barbies and things and there seems to me that that became a craze when she was already oh like you know third fourth fifth grade
sw3633B-ms98-a-0014 77.063500 83.582750 so she wasn't in it for very long before she was out of it but uh i don't remember her breaking a lot of stuff
sw3633B-ms98-a-0015 83.582750 90.801000 no i don't but i also don't remember lots of little pieces they've got so many different things with it now

sw3633B-ms98-a-0021 120.014750 125.029250 well uh i guess if they'll replace them_1 then they assume they shouldn't have broken
sw3633B-ms98-a-0022 125.029250 129.231250 [silence]
sw3633B-ms98-a-0023 129.231250 132.976250 any direction um um-hum
sw3633B-ms98-a-0024 132.976250 134.632625 [silence]

sw3633B-ms98-a-0027 138.285500 145.553125 yeah the main thing that they've they had when my daughter was playing with Barbies wa[s]- just clothes you know that was about it
sw3633B-ms98-a-0028 145.553125 147.529625 um-hum
sw3633B-ms98-a-0029 147.529625 151.072750 [silence]
sw3633B-ms98-a-0030 151.072750 155.685250 and the main thing my kids are seem to be into nowadays are electronics
sw3633B-ms98-a-0031 155.685250 161.600750 my my children are twenty one and twenty five and twenty eight
sw3633B-ms98-a-0032 161.600750 164.296375 um-hum and s[o]-
sw3633B-ms98-a-0033 164.296375 166.172750 [silence]
sw3633B-ms98-a-0034 166.172750 178.720625 no not really we uh haven't had that much you know problem with things that we have bought they seem to to last in fact when they offer us extended warranties we we don't buy them_1 because we've
sw3633B-ms98-a-0035 178.720625 188.397125 we do[n't]- we find we don't need them and uh it seems like it's just a an added tack on plus a lot of their credit cards now you know will guarantee
sw3633B-ms98-a-0036 188.397125 199.983375 if you purchase on your credit card you know then they e[xtended]- put an extended warranty on it if it doesn't work a[nd]- and uh or if you have a problem with it in a certain period of time so it seems like it's a waste of money
sw3633B-ms98-a-0037 199.983375 205.433250 [silence]
sw3633B-ms98-a-0038 205.433250 214.373250 um-hum and like i've even bought on a recliner once i bought you know a a an extended warranty for cleaning and stuff like that and i never used it

sw3633B-ms98-a-0040 215.396500 223.920375 and so th[ey]- it seems ridiculous and like [noise] washers and dryers and things like that i've never had one go out in fact they usually
sw3633B-ms98-a-0041 223.920375 234.298125 when they do go out it's either something my husband can buy the part and fix and we don't even have a repairman come or it means it's old enough that it's time to [laughter-replace] [laughter-the] [laughter-whole] [laughter-thing] um-hum
sw3633B-ms98-a-0042 234.298125 236.632000 so i mean they're [vocalized-noise]

sw3633B-ms98-a-0048 259.384750 260.927000 um-hum
sw3633B-ms98-a-0049 260.927000 268.707500 well my husband finally just put his foot down and he said we're not gonna buy any of these anymore and if it goes out well you know
sw3633B-ms98-a-0050 268.707500 277.988500 um-hum and uh so uh we really have been fairly happy with with things but now we take good care of things and we don't um
sw3633B-ms98-a-0051 277.988500 285.489625 run out and buy a lot of of things either and since our kids aren't little anymore i'm not buying a lot of those little [laughter-things] that can get broken
sw3633B-ms98-a-0052 285.489625 291.929500 [silence]
