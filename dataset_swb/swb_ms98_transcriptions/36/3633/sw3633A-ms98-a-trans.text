sw3633A-ms98-a-0028 110.686625 113.485750 less than a week later the arm was broken
sw3633A-ms98-a-0029 113.485750 114.547750 [silence]
sw3633A-ms98-a-0030 114.547750 120.293625 but they were real good about replacing it that's one nice thing is they're real good about replacing it

sw3633A-ms98-a-0034 132.493500 139.350875 she's not that big of a girl that i think could really [laughter] take a grip on it like a bigger kid could you know
sw3633A-ms98-a-0035 139.350875 143.110875 [silence]
sw3633A-ms98-a-0036 143.110875 144.562375 yes
sw3633A-ms98-a-0037 144.562375 149.451625 that was about it and the Barbie doll itself is usually pretty durable
sw3633A-ms98-a-0038 149.451625 151.901375 and that kind of stuff but
sw3633A-ms98-a-0039 151.901375 161.241125 [silence]
sw3633A-ms98-a-0040 161.241125 166.834125 oh is that right well do you see that there's a little big problem with electronic things

sw3633A-ms98-a-0049 198.823000 206.312750 well you almost assume if you're gonna have problems with it it's usually be[fore]- before that warranty would expire any the first one
sw3633A-ms98-a-0050 206.312750 213.584250 [silence]

sw3633A-ms98-a-0054 233.546000 238.392500 yes i- i think these extended warranties are gimmicks really
sw3633A-ms98-a-0055 238.392500 243.098125 a lot of it we bought when we first married we bought one on our TV
sw3633A-ms98-a-0056 243.098125 249.657625 [noise] and that there was it was a five year after the first five years and that was ridiculous

sw3633A-ms98-a-0065 283.525625 289.009750 yes the little well you probably are real careful of the brands you buy and the
sw3633A-ms98-a-0066 289.009750 295.410375 when you do buy things you probably watch what kind of type of quality yes
