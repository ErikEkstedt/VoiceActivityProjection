sw3640B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.700625 [noise]
sw3640B-ms98-a-0002 1.700625 9.741375 [noise] well uh [noise] i guess the thing about the Brewers is i think their personnel policies have been a little misguided lately
sw3640B-ms98-a-0003 9.741375 11.199375 um
sw3640B-ms98-a-0004 11.199375 21.389250 i think that's their main problem uh they seem to ha[ve]- have stuck with the same core of players uh Robin Yount Paul Molitor and Jim Gantner
sw3640B-ms98-a-0005 21.389250 27.549500 who uh they're real good players but they seem to just depend on them to produce a pennant and i[t]- it d[oesn't]- it isn't working
sw3640B-ms98-a-0006 27.549500 40.518750 [silence]
sw3640B-ms98-a-0007 40.518750 43.011625 except for papa Ryan anyway
sw3640B-ms98-a-0008 43.011625 44.097250 [silence]
sw3640B-ms98-a-0009 44.097250 45.519000 yeah
sw3640B-ms98-a-0010 45.519000 48.009500 that's right he can't win them_1 all for him
sw3640B-ms98-a-0011 48.009500 50.713000 [silence]
sw3640B-ms98-a-0012 50.713000 56.630625 yeah i think uh the thing about the Brewers is too their pitching they never have really had real good pitching uh
sw3640B-ms98-a-0013 56.630625 64.847500 last time they had really good pitching was back in the early eighties when they got to the World Series was with uh people like Vuckovich and Fingers
sw3640B-ms98-a-0014 64.847500 66.031375 [silence]
sw3640B-ms98-a-0015 66.031375 69.351750 yeah yeah and of course uh
sw3640B-ms98-a-0016 69.351750 74.302125 he got them to the Series but then just before the Series that year in eighty two he um
sw3640B-ms98-a-0017 74.302125 79.517375 uh threw his elbow out or something shoulder or elbow i can't remember which and uh
sw3640B-ms98-a-0018 79.517375 93.177000 they're number two right-hander in the bullpen Pete Ladd who was kind of a rookie that year uh had to take his place and uh i think that's why they lost the series because in in game two in Saint Louis
sw3640B-ms98-a-0019 93.177000 102.654750 they had a pretty good lead going into late innings and Ladd got rattled when he didn't get some calls and they ended up losing the game uh Ole Mustache Fingers would not have done that
sw3640B-ms98-a-0020 102.654750 110.184375 [silence]
sw3640B-ms98-a-0021 110.184375 116.460875 i can't remember if he's made it or not yet he he may not have been i don't know when he retired actually
sw3640B-ms98-a-0022 116.460875 117.686125 [silence]
sw3640B-ms98-a-0023 117.686125 122.051625 yeah but that was i think eighty two was
sw3640B-ms98-a-0024 122.051625 126.389500 well eighty one was the year i think that he won the the uh
sw3640B-ms98-a-0025 126.389500 138.684000 Cy Young and the MVP and the Fireman of the Year Award all at the same time i think but uh but in eighty two i think he won something some kind of award had a lot of saves anyway
sw3640B-ms98-a-0026 138.684000 157.936000 [silence]
sw3640B-ms98-a-0027 157.936000 163.625625 well i'd forgotten that Gossage was with the Rangers the the he was this year last year
sw3640B-ms98-a-0028 163.625625 167.540500 now did they pick him up uh sometime in the middle of the season or what
sw3640B-ms98-a-0029 167.540500 171.563875 [silence]
sw3640B-ms98-a-0030 171.563875 172.888875 yeah
sw3640B-ms98-a-0031 172.888875 175.233250 [silence]
sw3640B-ms98-a-0032 175.233250 178.317125 yeah well he's been quite a reliever in his time
sw3640B-ms98-a-0033 178.317125 197.437375 [silence]
sw3640B-ms98-a-0034 197.437375 198.472875 yeah
sw3640B-ms98-a-0035 198.472875 199.509125 [silence]
sw3640B-ms98-a-0036 199.509125 203.930625 well we'll be looking for them to uh to improve in that area i guess because_1 at least the uh
sw3640B-ms98-a-0037 203.930625 216.658750 now that i think about them_1 a little bit i'm getting sort of back through the football season back into baseball i realize when you think of the Rangers now you got a real good looking young outfield there for the most part and uh
sw3640B-ms98-a-0038 216.658750 219.515125 quite a few of the infielders are
sw3640B-ms98-a-0039 219.515125 227.190875 uh probably have g[ood]- real good careers still ahead of them_1 i'm not sure why they got rid of Buechele but i guess it worked out for him okay
sw3640B-ms98-a-0040 227.190875 232.670125 [silence]
sw3640B-ms98-a-0041 232.670125 234.059500 yeah
sw3640B-ms98-a-0042 234.059500 236.972750 oh Inky went the wrong way though didn't he
sw3640B-ms98-a-0043 236.972750 239.082625 [laughter]
sw3640B-ms98-a-0044 239.082625 240.413375 [silence]
sw3640B-ms98-a-0045 240.413375 243.297250 now who did they trade him to i f[orgot]- Cleveland
sw3640B-ms98-a-0046 243.297250 244.660750 Detroit
sw3640B-ms98-a-0047 244.660750 246.046500 oh
sw3640B-ms98-a-0048 246.046500 249.359750 oh they released him really didn't they
sw3640B-ms98-a-0049 249.359750 251.008625 [silence]
sw3640B-ms98-a-0050 251.008625 252.338125 yeah
sw3640B-ms98-a-0051 252.338125 254.032625 [silence]
sw3640B-ms98-a-0052 254.032625 263.666375 my goodness when he was when he was when he could really get into a ball though he was uh had a lot of power i tell you he reminds me a lot of Gorman Thomas remember him
sw3640B-ms98-a-0053 263.666375 268.434500 center fielder for the Brewers there for a while there was a guy that
sw3640B-ms98-a-0054 268.434500 281.728375 [silence]
sw3640B-ms98-a-0055 281.728375 286.536125 uh well i don't think his fielding was generally that bad he uh as a matter of fact he was t[o]-
sw3640B-ms98-a-0056 286.536125 288.762625 yeah right
sw3640B-ms98-a-0057 288.762625 295.455000 yeah he did get better and i think uh he was one of George Bamburger's big projects when he took over at the Brew[ers]- at Milwaukee
sw3640B-ms98-a-0058 295.455000 298.946000 he was the guy that was up and down uh
