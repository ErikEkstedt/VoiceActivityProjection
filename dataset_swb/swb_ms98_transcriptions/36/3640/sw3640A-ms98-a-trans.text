sw3640A-ms98-a-0003 27.711625 35.225250 well the problem with the Rangers is they've got a lot of offense they just don't have any pitching and really haven't had any pitching for years
sw3640A-ms98-a-0004 35.225250 38.184375 they're the top offensive team around but
sw3640A-ms98-a-0005 38.184375 41.459750 defense and pitching wins your games over the long haul
sw3640A-ms98-a-0006 41.459750 42.809125 [silence]
sw3640A-ms98-a-0007 42.809125 46.995000 well that's true but he only comes every five times so
sw3640A-ms98-a-0008 46.995000 50.189875 he can't win them_1 all and he's getting a little bit up there
sw3640A-ms98-a-0009 50.189875 64.515375 [silence]

sw3640A-ms98-a-0016 118.530125 139.036000 [silence]
sw3640A-ms98-a-0017 139.036000 141.698250 yeah we had a game here where uh
sw3640A-ms98-a-0018 141.698250 147.323375 we had Goose Gossage this year and Goose and uh Ryan combine and
sw3640A-ms98-a-0019 147.323375 158.962875 they got i don't know Ryan got his three hundred something win and at the same time Goose got his three hundred and something save and they were you know the same number and they said that it was an unusual occurrence to have that
sw3640A-ms98-a-0020 158.962875 161.684625 [silence]
sw3640A-ms98-a-0021 161.684625 164.124000 yeah but he's not coming back
sw3640A-ms98-a-0022 164.124000 166.306000 [silence]
sw3640A-ms98-a-0023 166.306000 172.118000 well no they got him at the very beginning of the season but he and the m[anager]- and manager Bobby Valentine didn't come along so
sw3640A-ms98-a-0024 172.118000 174.491875 Goose is Goose is history
sw3640A-ms98-a-0025 174.491875 177.358875 [silence]
sw3640A-ms98-a-0026 177.358875 181.737750 oh yeah he's a he's he's definitely headed to the Hall of Fame
sw3640A-ms98-a-0027 181.737750 189.087250 But the Rangers have you know a a pretty good lineup now um with the with the addition of the uh
sw3640A-ms98-a-0028 189.087250 197.940625 Dickey Thorne at uh short stop that ought to help them but their problem is other than Ryan and an occasional flash of brilliance of other people there's just nobody there
sw3640A-ms98-a-0029 197.940625 226.496375 [silence]
sw3640A-ms98-a-0030 226.496375 231.851875 well at least he got to play in a championship the Rangers have never won the division so
sw3640A-ms98-a-0031 231.851875 234.974625 w[e're]- we're obviously not going to last year
sw3640A-ms98-a-0032 234.974625 236.292125 [silence]
sw3640A-ms98-a-0033 236.292125 238.375375 yeah i think he's history
sw3640A-ms98-a-0034 238.375375 239.504875 [silence]

sw3640A-ms98-a-0037 242.579750 244.048625 Detroit
sw3640A-ms98-a-0038 244.048625 248.036000 well they didn't yeah they he went to Detroit they really didn't get much for him
sw3640A-ms98-a-0039 248.036000 251.612625 yeah they released him and he had to go around trying to sign up with somebody
sw3640A-ms98-a-0040 251.612625 254.244625 but he proved to be a total disaster
sw3640A-ms98-a-0041 254.244625 262.834250 [silence]
sw3640A-ms98-a-0042 262.834250 264.347375 yeah
sw3640A-ms98-a-0043 264.347375 265.471750 [silence]
sw3640A-ms98-a-0044 265.471750 273.405250 yeah he did something he i saw i saw him hit a grand slam once in a game when i was there but i also saw him 
sw3640A-ms98-a-0045 273.405250 281.557500 drop a ball that cost a couple runs ended up costing the game so he could you know he could be both brilliant and with a bat and just a disaster in the field
sw3640A-ms98-a-0046 281.557500 284.856750 [silence]
sw3640A-ms98-a-0047 284.856750 289.116250 it was early on it got better but it was pretty bad at the beginning
sw3640A-ms98-a-0048 289.116250 298.946000 [silence]
