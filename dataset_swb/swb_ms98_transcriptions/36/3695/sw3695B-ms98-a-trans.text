sw3695B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 3.680000 [noise] me think a political event that happened this year
sw3695B-ms98-a-0002 3.680000 5.245625 well
sw3695B-ms98-a-0003 5.245625 7.436000 there's David Duke
sw3695B-ms98-a-0004 7.436000 11.040000 and then there's the dissolution of the [laughter-Soviet] [laughter-Union]
sw3695B-ms98-a-0005 11.040000 12.476375 [laughter]
sw3695B-ms98-a-0006 12.476375 13.505875 [silence]

sw3695B-ms98-a-0008 14.886625 17.414875 [silence]
sw3695B-ms98-a-0009 17.414875 21.701000 well [vocalized-noise] if i was a mind to i might burn a cross on his yard
sw3695B-ms98-a-0010 21.701000 25.606750 thing that what scares me is some of the things he says i agree with
sw3695B-ms98-a-0011 25.606750 28.483625 you know i just don't agree [laughter-with] [laughter-his] [laughter-methods]
sw3695B-ms98-a-0012 28.483625 39.692250 you know i think that the way to you know cut out the welfare poor is not to cut out welfare it's to provide an equal opportunity for people to make a living
sw3695B-ms98-a-0013 39.692250 43.329500 and protect them from themselves
sw3695B-ms98-a-0014 43.329500 47.708875 basically you know i've i've seen this very close hand
sw3695B-ms98-a-0015 47.708875 49.530125 a kid
sw3695B-ms98-a-0016 49.530125 54.025125 twelve years old can make about three thousand dollars a day dealing crack
sw3695B-ms98-a-0017 54.025125 57.492375 if he lives to his twenty first birthday it would be a miracle
sw3695B-ms98-a-0018 57.492375 58.630500 [silence]
sw3695B-ms98-a-0019 58.630500 66.561500 so we're we as a nation have an obligation to our future generations to
sw3695B-ms98-a-0020 66.561500 68.267875 [silence]
sw3695B-ms98-a-0021 68.267875 73.613875 yeah to make dealing crack a a crime punishable
sw3695B-ms98-a-0022 73.613875 81.311875 in such a way that nobody would want to do that and and it our constitution expressly forbids that kind of punishment
sw3695B-ms98-a-0023 81.311875 87.198000 [silence]
sw3695B-ms98-a-0024 87.198000 93.414125 yeah i i'm considering doing it you know and i got a job today anyway
sw3695B-ms98-a-0025 93.414125 104.352875 [silence]

sw3695B-ms98-a-0027 105.868875 111.098875 [silence]
sw3695B-ms98-a-0028 111.098875 113.987500 right or wrong rarely has anything to do with politics
sw3695B-ms98-a-0029 113.987500 117.913000 uh what i'm seeing here is that
sw3695B-ms98-a-0030 117.913000 122.978375 the real problem see David Duke addresses symptoms
sw3695B-ms98-a-0031 122.978375 125.305625 [silence]
sw3695B-ms98-a-0032 125.305625 128.116875 the real problem is if
sw3695B-ms98-a-0033 128.116875 130.420875 i work for a man
sw3695B-ms98-a-0034 130.420875 135.297625 say i work for a guy as a matter of fact i'm going to work for a guy Friday new job

sw3695B-ms98-a-0039 149.928625 155.416000 you know if you drive onto the Ford manufacturing lot in a Datsun
sw3695B-ms98-a-0040 155.416000 161.399625 i believe that not only should you be fired you all of your assets should be given over to the government
sw3695B-ms98-a-0041 161.399625 162.579250 [silence]
sw3695B-ms98-a-0042 162.579250 167.811250 [laughter-because] you're crippling the very economy with which you're trying to survive in
sw3695B-ms98-a-0043 167.811250 171.484500 now i believe in free choice don't get me wrong

sw3695B-ms98-a-0046 178.595500 183.898250 that's just because i'm an American i believe that that's the way you ought to do it
sw3695B-ms98-a-0047 183.898250 193.945125 i mean sure having a Mazda or a Nissan or whatever they're called these days sure that'd be a real status symbol but you ain't gonna impress my neighbors
