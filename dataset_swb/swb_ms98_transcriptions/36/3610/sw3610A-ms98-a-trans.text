sw3610A-ms98-a-0056 270.130125 274.791750 [laughter] right i- i think that that's more though with a mother that's working
sw3610A-ms98-a-0057 274.791750 284.314000 than than just a wife because i'm i'm not just a wife but a wife i i'm grateful that none of my {daughters-in-laws} at this time are working
sw3610A-ms98-a-0058 284.314000 297.218000 because they all have small families and they're just i just think it's so sad when a [noise] mother has to get a tiny baby up in the morning two months old and it's cold here and take him to a babysitter
