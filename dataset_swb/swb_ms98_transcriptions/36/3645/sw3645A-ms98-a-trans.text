sw3645A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.904125 [noise] -[wh]at magazines are you reading these days
sw3645A-ms98-a-0002 1.904125 40.988625 [silence]
sw3645A-ms98-a-0003 40.988625 44.599250 well i get the three um weeklies Newsweek and
sw3645A-ms98-a-0004 44.599250 58.224250 Time and US News i also get Sports Illustrated guess those are the only ones i get weekly and then once a month we get a whole slew of them we get Money Magazine and um Southern Living and Country Living and
sw3645A-ms98-a-0005 58.224250 62.092750 and um my wife has a whole ton of them_1 she subscribes to
sw3645A-ms98-a-0006 62.092750 65.328250 a whole whole bunch of those
sw3645A-ms98-a-0007 65.328250 75.260750 well i gue[ss]- i guess the good thing about these um weekly magazines especially how they put things in them you know they have time to at least put things in perspective
sw3645A-ms98-a-0008 75.260750 88.173000 but uh you know i guess the bad thing is they don't have the immediacy of you know radio or TV or a or a newspaper but they certainly can you know give you a bigger picture on things than than the than the daily media can
sw3645A-ms98-a-0009 88.173000 96.574625 [silence]
sw3645A-ms98-a-0010 96.574625 108.484250 they can be responsive too i know this summer US News was going to take a week off in August and then when the attempted coup came along they quickly came out with an i[ssue]- an issue that they weren't going to do
sw3645A-ms98-a-0011 108.484250 112.444375 which shows that they're that they're certainly are responsive to changing events
sw3645A-ms98-a-0012 112.444375 155.536375 [silence]
sw3645A-ms98-a-0013 155.536375 170.095125 well i think you're right i think trend in reading i think one reason that the Times Herald folded and other papers folded is the people are reading newspapers less than they used to and i guess that means they must be reading magazines and you know other written stuff less too
sw3645A-ms98-a-0014 170.095125 183.620125 [silence]
sw3645A-ms98-a-0015 183.620125 193.895125 of course then you have the specialty magazines like magazines on baseball or Golf Digest or or knitting or crocheting and all these things
sw3645A-ms98-a-0016 193.895125 204.651000 that have a selective market [noise] that just aim at one kind of thing those maybe it's that the that the special purpose magazines are doing better and the ones that are more general aren't doing as well
sw3645A-ms98-a-0017 204.651000 207.434625 [silence]
sw3645A-ms98-a-0018 207.434625 208.376750 [noise]
sw3645A-ms98-a-0019 208.376750 210.915375 [silence]
sw3645A-ms98-a-0020 210.915375 221.746625 yeah i guess if you want to find out a specific item you have nowhere else to turn if you want to find out the the latest in gardening trends unless you read a gardening magazine you're not going to find this anyplace else
sw3645A-ms98-a-0021 221.746625 229.160500 whereas if you want to know what happened in in in Russia today you can turn on the radio or TV and you don't really have to read a paper or magazine to find out something
sw3645A-ms98-a-0022 229.160500 237.575875 that may be it and with desktop publishing and stuff i think a lot more magazines that are that aim just smaller market will be coming out
sw3645A-ms98-a-0023 237.575875 258.288125 [silence]
sw3645A-ms98-a-0024 258.288125 261.762125 yeah i heard uh i heard it too Skip Bayless wasn't it yeah

sw3645A-ms98-a-0027 269.263875 272.827125 [silence]
sw3645A-ms98-a-0028 272.827125 277.154500 yeah i thought that i that would be interesting to to see though
sw3645A-ms98-a-0029 277.154500 295.974000 [silence]
