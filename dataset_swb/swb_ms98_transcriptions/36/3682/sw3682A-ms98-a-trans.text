sw3682A-ms98-a-0044 139.208500 146.340500 you don't like it oh you do okay yeah i have a really easy recipe for that where you just brown the chicken and then you
sw3682A-ms98-a-0045 146.340500 156.940750 put rice in the bottom of the pan you pour bouillon or chicken broth over it and or you put the chicken in then pour the uh broth over and you can put mushrooms in if you want and then just 
sw3682A-ms98-a-0046 156.940750 164.684625 yeah over uncooked rice and you can either microwave it or do it in the oven and it just it fluffs up and it's really moist and

sw3682A-ms98-a-0062 212.402375 217.522375 yeah you put in um let's see what was it three quarters of cup of rice or
sw3682A-ms98-a-0063 217.522375 227.751375 it depends on you can really vary it but you have to put the water in proportionally i can't remember i think it was three quarters cup rice to two cups water two cups um broth
sw3682A-ms98-a-0064 227.751375 229.183000 and

sw3682A-ms98-a-0068 238.061625 248.035750 uh-huh um let's see i think it was an hour i've done it in the microwave so often lately because it's it's really easy [laughter] yeah
sw3682A-ms98-a-0069 248.035750 254.740625 but i think it's about an hour or maybe it's only half hour hm um
sw3682A-ms98-a-0070 254.740625 261.504500 you just until the rice looks fluffy and and not overdone you know before it gets overdone
sw3682A-ms98-a-0071 261.504500 262.549375 [silence]
sw3682A-ms98-a-0072 262.549375 270.714125 yeah yeah um i'd let it cook just a little bit just so that the cooking goes a little faster but
sw3682A-ms98-a-0073 270.714125 274.244250 [laughter-yeah] well i liked it your idea too there
