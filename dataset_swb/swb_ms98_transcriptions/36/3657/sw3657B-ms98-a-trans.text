sw3657B-ms98-a-0025 203.412750 208.151875 kind of this is this is part of giving back a portion of what he's given to us
sw3657B-ms98-a-0026 208.151875 215.928875 so uh i don't mind because_1 seems like the more we do there's there's the more stuff that's uh available that comes along and so forth
sw3657B-ms98-a-0027 215.928875 217.347000 and

sw3657B-ms98-a-0029 228.411750 237.199000 because_1 the the top of the line we've got well we've got a compatible to eight meg of RAM and and two two two hundred and eleven hard drives
sw3657B-ms98-a-0030 237.199000 240.390500 [silence]

sw3657B-ms98-a-0035 251.773125 255.697125 takes uh uh well four megs minimum
sw3657B-ms98-a-0036 255.697125 261.720875 of RAM and then uh it it it likes to live on about a hundred and fifty megabyte hard drive
sw3657B-ms98-a-0037 261.720875 265.541125 so the next size up was a two hundred and eleven and so
sw3657B-ms98-a-0038 265.541125 268.615250 rather than just have one we went ahead and got two
sw3657B-ms98-a-0039 268.615250 274.101750 uh at some point in time i'm going to do the mirroring uh experiment to where
sw3657B-ms98-a-0040 274.101750 277.947750 one disc mirrors the other for fault tolerance
sw3657B-ms98-a-0041 277.947750 287.671750 and uh oh speak speak of the angel she just walked in [noise] <b_aside> its TI stuff <e_aside> so uh uh
