sw3658A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.140250 [noise]
sw3658A-ms98-a-0002 0.140250 2.492625 okay
sw3658A-ms98-a-0003 2.492625 4.653125 um that's right
sw3658A-ms98-a-0004 4.653125 7.103625 [silence]
sw3658A-ms98-a-0005 7.103625 10.010000 what would we like to say [laughter] i think
sw3658A-ms98-a-0006 10.010000 12.910250 [silence]
sw3658A-ms98-a-0007 12.910250 14.377125 um-hum
sw3658A-ms98-a-0008 14.377125 15.831500 [silence]
sw3658A-ms98-a-0009 15.831500 18.531875 i think that's what the subject is about
sw3658A-ms98-a-0010 18.531875 22.620375 [silence]
sw3658A-ms98-a-0011 22.620375 26.907125 in the Dallas the Morning Times i guess i did not
sw3658A-ms98-a-0012 26.907125 62.028625 [silence]
sw3658A-ms98-a-0013 62.028625 64.627500 well it's been interesting that we
sw3658A-ms98-a-0014 64.627500 65.786500 yes
sw3658A-ms98-a-0015 65.786500 74.705500 so we live in a society though where everyone if you ask them_1 on polls will um say that they think that everyone has a right to health care
sw3658A-ms98-a-0016 74.705500 80.254000 and yet i don't think we've ever quite decided who's really supposed to pay for it and
sw3658A-ms98-a-0017 80.254000 91.343375 [silence]
sw3658A-ms98-a-0018 91.343375 99.622750 which is why people are talking [laughter-about] we ought to just admit it perhaps and then try and somehow subsidize it in a way that's more fair
sw3658A-ms98-a-0019 99.622750 102.515250 [silence]
sw3658A-ms98-a-0020 102.515250 106.107375 you have health insurance through your company
sw3658A-ms98-a-0021 106.107375 122.775875 [silence]
sw3658A-ms98-a-0022 122.775875 124.471250 oh my goodness
sw3658A-ms98-a-0023 124.471250 126.012875 [silence]
sw3658A-ms98-a-0024 126.012875 128.124500 that must've been horri[ble]-
sw3658A-ms98-a-0025 128.124500 129.197500 [silence]
sw3658A-ms98-a-0026 129.197500 131.270375 how was your care at Parkland
sw3658A-ms98-a-0027 131.270375 145.492250 [silence]
sw3658A-ms98-a-0028 145.492250 148.248875 but Camp Parkland is not free either
sw3658A-ms98-a-0029 148.248875 150.103375 [silence]
sw3658A-ms98-a-0030 150.103375 151.776375 is it affordable
sw3658A-ms98-a-0031 151.776375 159.332375 [silence]
sw3658A-ms98-a-0032 159.332375 161.374750 so you did have a good experience
sw3658A-ms98-a-0033 161.374750 168.817625 [silence]
sw3658A-ms98-a-0034 168.817625 171.171250 is your wife better i hope
sw3658A-ms98-a-0035 171.171250 173.478625 i'm real sorry
sw3658A-ms98-a-0036 173.478625 177.044125 sure it does happen but it's very sad
sw3658A-ms98-a-0037 177.044125 180.838875 [silence]
sw3658A-ms98-a-0038 180.838875 195.097125 [noise] well so am i [laughter] actually um i'm a pediatrician and i feel very strongly about um children and um developed very strong feelings about this during our measles epidemic last year
sw3658A-ms98-a-0039 195.097125 202.143750 where we certainly proved that we're not doing a very good job with preventive health care among children and particularly the children who need it most
sw3658A-ms98-a-0040 202.143750 211.988625 so um i'm really quite active in trying to uh uh be proactive at least to for children's issues it's very complex very complicated but
sw3658A-ms98-a-0041 211.988625 220.682875 um i just strongly believe that all children have a right to immunization glasses hearing aids [laughter] basic health benefits
sw3658A-ms98-a-0042 220.682875 241.658000 [silence]
sw3658A-ms98-a-0043 241.658000 242.892500 um
sw3658A-ms98-a-0044 242.892500 253.162750 [silence]
sw3658A-ms98-a-0045 253.162750 258.882625 -[w]ell and the costs of so much has gone up so much the cost of immunizations for example
sw3658A-ms98-a-0046 258.882625 261.668750 um and just the legal [laughter]
sw3658A-ms98-a-0047 261.668750 269.232875 the legal benefits um that has really forced people into doing a lot of things unnecessarily et cetera
sw3658A-ms98-a-0048 269.232875 278.698750 so well i don't know it's it is interesting in case you didn't know Texas leads the nation in uninsured children thirty one percent of all Texas children
sw3658A-ms98-a-0049 278.698750 281.666875 do not have insurance and are not on Medicaid
sw3658A-ms98-a-0050 281.666875 287.280125 so uh one out of every three children has nothing to reimburse them for their health care
sw3658A-ms98-a-0051 287.280125 292.789500 and i work in the children's Parkland system and it's pretty overwhelming to me
sw3658A-ms98-a-0052 292.789500 299.394000 but um it's pretty hard to be indigent and to be dependent upon indigent health care systems in Dallas county
