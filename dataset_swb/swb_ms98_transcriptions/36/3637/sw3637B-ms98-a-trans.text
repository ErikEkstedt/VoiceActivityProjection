sw3637B-ms98-a-0025 119.602750 122.992000 [silence]
sw3637B-ms98-a-0026 122.992000 126.313625 uh i guess because her friends signed up
sw3637B-ms98-a-0027 126.313625 133.498875 and she wanted to sign up she twirls and she's she's been real real involved in that so we haven't had time for soccer
sw3637B-ms98-a-0028 133.498875 138.988500 which is the most important thing around here pretty i mean all the little kids play soccer
sw3637B-ms98-a-0029 138.988500 142.254500 they even have like a preschool soccer team
sw3637B-ms98-a-0030 142.254500 147.138875 it's big in Texas and i maybe all over now i don't know but
sw3637B-ms98-a-0031 147.138875 150.583750 uh it's very big here but we didn't have that time
sw3637B-ms98-a-0032 150.583750 155.019125 and so i did let her play basketball and i like it because it's indoors
sw3637B-ms98-a-0033 155.019125 161.405250 yeah [laughter] [laughter-i] [laughter-like] [laughter-indoor] [laughter-things] so yeah
sw3637B-ms98-a-0034 161.405250 162.923000 [silence]
sw3637B-ms98-a-0035 162.923000 170.390750 yeah well she's pretty fast she's not real big but she's real fast and so um
sw3637B-ms98-a-0036 170.390750 174.565125 [silence]
sw3637B-ms98-a-0037 174.565125 176.473500 yeah
sw3637B-ms98-a-0038 176.473500 189.811500 yeah but oh in the beginning you know they couldn't even make the basket and they were allowed to stand halfway forward to take that take solid shots and they couldn't even get the ball that high because they were so little and not strong enough
sw3637B-ms98-a-0039 189.811500 194.939375 and then uh her last game just before the whistle blew they had two seconds left
sw3637B-ms98-a-0040 194.939375 198.967125 she threw the ball from center court and it went right into the basket
sw3637B-ms98-a-0041 198.967125 211.718625 so she was the hero after all those years of trying to get that ball up in that [laughter-basket] [laughter-so] and so that was pretty fun to see the improvement [laughter] and her coach was behind us in the bleachers but
sw3637B-ms98-a-0042 211.718625 219.999750 from the other team and he said [noise] Christmas came early this year [laughter] so yeah
sw3637B-ms98-a-0043 219.999750 228.471625 no my son never played uh basketball he's he's grown and he he's in the band and he swam some
sw3637B-ms98-a-0044 228.471625 232.058875 mostly he was a student [laughter] [laughter-so]
sw3637B-ms98-a-0045 232.058875 241.503000 yeah he's a national merit student and he speaks five languages and all that so he wasn't much into sports he did play baseball for a while and he liked that
sw3637B-ms98-a-0046 241.503000 245.913125 but um he didn't he didn't play basketball at all
sw3637B-ms98-a-0047 245.913125 251.022375 i did i played basketball in high school i loved it that and volleyball
sw3637B-ms98-a-0048 251.022375 252.095500 [vocalized-noise]
sw3637B-ms98-a-0049 252.095500 255.765000 [silence]
sw3637B-ms98-a-0050 255.765000 257.272250 uh-huh
sw3637B-ms98-a-0051 257.272250 258.350625 [silence]
sw3637B-ms98-a-0052 258.350625 262.728750 yeah i love it i think it's my favorite and it's my favorite to watch
sw3637B-ms98-a-0053 262.728750 266.219500 and when i was in high school i was a twirler and so
sw3637B-ms98-a-0054 266.219500 270.344250 i always enjoyed that and cheerleading you know we got to do it indoors
sw3637B-ms98-a-0055 270.344250 276.811250 so i always liked the basketball games better than the football games because you weren't out in the cold so
sw3637B-ms98-a-0056 276.811250 283.728125 [silence]
sw3637B-ms98-a-0057 283.728125 286.870875 well yeah and it's easier to follow
sw3637B-ms98-a-0058 286.870875 293.332250 if the ball goes in they get two points football everybody falls on top of each other and it's real difficult to say
sw3637B-ms98-a-0059 293.332250 298.626000 exactly what went [laughter-wrong] [laughter-you] [laughter-know] for me [laughter-anyway] [noise] so
