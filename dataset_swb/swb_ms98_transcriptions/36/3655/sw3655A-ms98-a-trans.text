sw3655A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 2.775750 [noise] so uh what do you think about child care [laughter]
sw3655A-ms98-a-0002 2.775750 10.558875 [silence]
sw3655A-ms98-a-0003 10.558875 11.774250 right
sw3655A-ms98-a-0004 11.774250 15.925875 [silence]
sw3655A-ms98-a-0005 15.925875 21.155500 probably find someone how come you wouldn't take them_1 to a day care just because_1 of the
sw3655A-ms98-a-0006 21.155500 24.525750 [silence]
sw3655A-ms98-a-0007 24.525750 26.826375 yeah they seem to pass a lot a
sw3655A-ms98-a-0008 26.826375 30.836125 [silence]
sw3655A-ms98-a-0009 30.836125 33.411875 yeah you kind of wonder whether or not
sw3655A-ms98-a-0010 33.411875 37.990000 [silence]
sw3655A-ms98-a-0011 37.990000 40.830625 i took uh Cammy to a
sw3655A-ms98-a-0012 40.830625 44.629375 [noise] oh it was a preschool day care type of thing
sw3655A-ms98-a-0013 44.629375 55.478125 [noise] but i kind of i liked it in some ways and some ways i didn't um i think the ratio of kids to teacher is really important
sw3655A-ms98-a-0014 55.478125 57.323875 and
sw3655A-ms98-a-0015 57.323875 58.979625 well
sw3655A-ms98-a-0016 58.979625 61.866750 i think they had a
sw3655A-ms98-a-0017 61.866750 65.487875 [noise] they had two teachers and i think there were twenty kids
sw3655A-ms98-a-0018 65.487875 70.650500 but i only had her going two days and most the other kids were going more days [noise]
sw3655A-ms98-a-0019 70.650500 73.016500 so that was probably my own fault
sw3655A-ms98-a-0020 73.016500 78.836500 that she didn't oh you know one thing i noticed is uh
sw3655A-ms98-a-0021 78.836500 83.191375 um just they were trying to get her to teach her to write her name
sw3655A-ms98-a-0022 83.191375 93.856250 and uh i didn't notice it until this summer when i was working with her that she'd bend her wrist all the way oh not in a natural sh[ape]- form
sw3655A-ms98-a-0023 93.856250 103.857250 yes and uh i was kind of m[ad]- mad that they had never noticed that and either pointed it out to me or
sw3655A-ms98-a-0024 103.857250 112.211000 or uh tried to say look you're holding your she's holding her pencil in the right fingers and stuff sh[e]- but she was
sw3655A-ms98-a-0025 112.211000 114.065000 yes
sw3655A-ms98-a-0026 114.065000 121.155500 and uh i hadn't worked with her on writing at all at that point she was four
sw3655A-ms98-a-0027 121.155500 124.995625 or three yeah she was uh it was last year
sw3655A-ms98-a-0028 124.995625 134.268250 and uh then this summer i got the thing from the school that says things to work with the kids on and i wor[ked]- like i said i didn't notice it till then
sw3655A-ms98-a-0029 134.268250 138.496375 because_1 i hadn't worked with writing letters or anything and
sw3655A-ms98-a-0030 138.496375 140.658000 stuff like that
sw3655A-ms98-a-0031 140.658000 143.634625 no they never
sw3655A-ms98-a-0032 143.634625 155.049500 course like i said i took her two days a week and maybe that was my main reason for taking [noise] her was um just social skills more than anything else
sw3655A-ms98-a-0033 155.049500 156.897250 i felt she needed the s[ocial]-
sw3655A-ms98-a-0034 156.897250 161.528375 [noise] just i didn't feel like she was mature enough socially and
sw3655A-ms98-a-0035 161.528375 163.133375 um
sw3655A-ms98-a-0036 163.133375 167.957500 [silence]
sw3655A-ms98-a-0037 167.957500 169.301250 um-hum
sw3655A-ms98-a-0038 169.301250 174.635625 oh yeah i think it would be hard to take them to people you don't know
sw3655A-ms98-a-0039 174.635625 183.084250 preschool's a different thing but i think it's hard to take kids to somebody you don't know and or unless you have awfully [laughter-good] references
sw3655A-ms98-a-0040 183.084250 185.747625 reliable um
sw3655A-ms98-a-0041 185.747625 191.190625 people i don't know it's so hard to take young kids anywhere for very long
sw3655A-ms98-a-0042 191.190625 192.810250 [silence]
sw3655A-ms98-a-0043 192.810250 198.171500 it is the older ones it's not you don't even really have any
sw3655A-ms98-a-0044 198.171500 205.729250 real worries because_1 you know that they'll play with whoever's there and they usually adapt pretty well
sw3655A-ms98-a-0045 205.729250 207.877375 but uh
sw3655A-ms98-a-0046 207.877375 213.738500 [silence]
sw3655A-ms98-a-0047 213.738500 220.290375 well and you know their kind of their schedules and you know if they're upset and
sw3655A-ms98-a-0048 220.290375 222.599500 that type of a deal
sw3655A-ms98-a-0049 222.599500 230.627875 i don't know how um people uh that have young kids work and work full time and
sw3655A-ms98-a-0050 230.627875 236.532750 and do it really without being stressed out all the time i think it's
sw3655A-ms98-a-0051 236.532750 238.302000 well i don't know
sw3655A-ms98-a-0052 238.302000 242.431250 then then on the other hand i think it's harder to stay home in some [laughter-regards]
sw3655A-ms98-a-0053 242.431250 244.273125 it's hard to
sw3655A-ms98-a-0054 244.273125 249.408750 always keep yourself feeling like you're doing something productive and
sw3655A-ms98-a-0055 249.408750 256.593750 at the end of the day your house still feels like it's a mess and you haven't got anything done and what am i gonna fix for [laughter-supper]
sw3655A-ms98-a-0056 256.593750 258.002625 [silence]
sw3655A-ms98-a-0057 258.002625 263.612250 yeah it's kind of hard to always feel [laughter-like] gosh what i[s]- is this important what i'm doing [laughter-and]
sw3655A-ms98-a-0058 263.612250 264.681375 [silence]
sw3655A-ms98-a-0059 264.681375 267.301000 no no it
sw3655A-ms98-a-0060 267.301000 268.855250 [noise] it doesn't
sw3655A-ms98-a-0061 268.855250 278.119750 but i think that taking kids to a probably people that take them_1 to uh preschools and day cares full time
sw3655A-ms98-a-0062 278.119750 280.885250 oh they would [noise] i don't know
sw3655A-ms98-a-0063 280.885250 282.032500 [silence]
sw3655A-ms98-a-0064 282.032500 285.414500 probably just feel a different uh
sw3655A-ms98-a-0065 285.414500 297.513125 i think i just think it would be hard to do that full time i feel such a responsibility even when we go out for a few hours that are they driving the babysitter crazy and
sw3655A-ms98-a-0066 297.513125 298.789250 [silence]
