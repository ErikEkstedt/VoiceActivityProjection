sw3652B-ms98-a-0003 3.513000 7.831000 no i think the Cowboys have a good chance to really um
sw3652B-ms98-a-0004 7.831000 14.164125 possibly take it all the way they're one of the they're one of two teams that actually beat Washington Redskins
sw3652B-ms98-a-0005 14.164125 17.782750 ah however Washington has been uh
sw3652B-ms98-a-0006 17.782750 21.466625 what do you call it has been resting up
sw3652B-ms98-a-0007 21.466625 29.597250 and uh that could really hurt the Cowboys especially if they have a lot of injuries coming into uh [noise] the next two games
sw3652B-ms98-a-0008 29.597250 40.934000 [silence]
sw3652B-ms98-a-0009 40.934000 43.819625 [laughter]

sw3652B-ms98-a-0012 48.010375 53.504000 well uh that would be an interesting game i think that game would be sold out what do you think
sw3652B-ms98-a-0013 53.504000 59.749625 [silence]
sw3652B-ms98-a-0014 59.749625 69.526875 yes i think so because uh i think Warren Moon and uh Steve Beuerlein and Troy Aikman are some of the hottest quarterbacks for the uh for the nineteen nineties
sw3652B-ms98-a-0015 69.526875 76.461500 [silence]
sw3652B-ms98-a-0016 76.461500 79.815250 yeah the no name defense that's pretty good 
sw3652B-ms98-a-0017 79.815250 86.293750 [silence]
sw3652B-ms98-a-0018 86.293750 92.459500 well did you see in the paper last Sunday about uh the salaries for the different um

sw3652B-ms98-a-0020 94.968750 98.027500 well what do you think about uh
sw3652B-ms98-a-0021 98.027500 102.128375 Montana being paid so much for not playing this year
sw3652B-ms98-a-0022 102.128375 103.777250 [silence]
sw3652B-ms98-a-0023 103.777250 105.249375 [laughter]
sw3652B-ms98-a-0024 105.249375 117.821625 [silence]

sw3652B-ms98-a-0026 119.501500 125.135125 sure i think it will be too and i think Steve Beuerlein might get a little raise too he's uh
sw3652B-ms98-a-0027 125.135125 136.235500 um Troy Aikman i wonder even though he's a real good player i wonder if he's going to be able to uh stand the physical abuse that the NFL offers he might not make it
sw3652B-ms98-a-0028 136.235500 148.711500 [silence]
sw3652B-ms98-a-0029 148.711500 155.734125 yep so what do you think about uh the games that's going to be played uh tomorrow Buffalo and
sw3652B-ms98-a-0030 155.734125 158.395625 who they playing the uh
sw3652B-ms98-a-0031 158.395625 161.030375 Kansas City Chiefs
sw3652B-ms98-a-0032 161.030375 176.357375 [silence]
sw3652B-ms98-a-0033 176.357375 181.606250 yeah i think John Elway still has a hot hand the trouble is is sometimes it's cold
sw3652B-ms98-a-0034 181.606250 187.104125 and uh he's not consistent he he has a good day he has a bad day
sw3652B-ms98-a-0035 187.104125 195.825750 um i like that these other quarterbacks that that are are more consistent i think Beuerlein has been more consistent
sw3652B-ms98-a-0036 195.825750 209.106000 [silence]
