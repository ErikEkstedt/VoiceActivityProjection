sw3652A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.318250 [noise]
sw3652A-ms98-a-0002 0.318250 6.005250 think the Cowboys are gonna go further or is this the end of the line
sw3652A-ms98-a-0003 6.005250 29.431750 [silence]
sw3652A-ms98-a-0004 29.431750 33.341375 well there was a uh article in the Wall Street Journal
sw3652A-ms98-a-0005 33.341375 41.353875 oh a couple weeks ago before the play-offs started and it said their long shot prediction was Cowboys versus Oilers in the Super Bowl
sw3652A-ms98-a-0006 41.353875 42.522500 [noise]
sw3652A-ms98-a-0007 42.522500 45.979500 then they gave their reasons why they thought both of those teams had a [noise]
sw3652A-ms98-a-0008 45.979500 47.691875 had a decent chance at it
sw3652A-ms98-a-0009 47.691875 53.023375 [silence]
sw3652A-ms98-a-0010 53.023375 60.170500 yeah i don't think there'd be any problem there the only question is would the rest of the country be interested in watching two Texas teams slug it out
sw3652A-ms98-a-0011 60.170500 68.434000 [silence]
sw3652A-ms98-a-0012 68.434000 78.205250 yeah they'll probably want to see Emmett Smith and uh and uh see Novacek and see Irwin out there and and the no name defense so who knows
sw3652A-ms98-a-0013 78.205250 86.695875 well and then Houston's got a a good core of about good five good receivers out there that uh that Moon likes to likes to throw to
sw3652A-ms98-a-0014 86.695875 93.716000 [silence]
sw3652A-ms98-a-0015 93.716000 95.776125 yeah i sure did
sw3652A-ms98-a-0016 95.776125 98.424625 [silence]
sw3652A-ms98-a-0017 98.424625 99.678625 [vocalized-noise]
sw3652A-ms98-a-0018 99.678625 101.491250 [silence]
sw3652A-ms98-a-0019 101.491250 104.589500 well he he had himself a good contract
sw3652A-ms98-a-0020 104.589500 117.693125 you know if he's got a contract that pays him regardless of injuries he's in good shape well you know that Michael Irvin's going to get a big boost and already uh Jones has said that uh they anticipate that he'll be giving Michael Irvin a big pay raise
sw3652A-ms98-a-0021 117.693125 120.326875 so i think that'll be coming
sw3652A-ms98-a-0022 120.326875 135.442375 [silence]
sw3652A-ms98-a-0023 135.442375 148.210375 well his problem is that he since he doesn't seem as mobile as some of the other quarterbacks he seems to get one bad injury every year so Beuerlein or someone like Beuerlein is going to be a necessity while Aikman's around
sw3652A-ms98-a-0024 148.210375 156.680250 [silence]
sw3652A-ms98-a-0025 156.680250 159.920625 uh Buffalo's playing um Kansas City
sw3652A-ms98-a-0026 159.920625 165.821000 well i i really think Buffalo wi[ll]- will win the game i'll be surprised if Kansas City wins it
sw3652A-ms98-a-0027 165.821000 176.628875 but uh Houston Denver um that one might be more even than than people would otherwise think i don't think that one's gonna be uh blow out for anybody it might be a pretty close game
sw3652A-ms98-a-0028 176.628875 181.963875 [silence]
sw3652A-ms98-a-0029 181.963875 184.233500 and you and you never know
sw3652A-ms98-a-0030 184.233500 194.805000 [silence]
sw3652A-ms98-a-0031 194.805000 209.349250 well Beuerlein's only had interceptions in one of the six games he's played and although he isn't throwing that many passes or completing that many you know if you're completing them to the right people at the right time you've got a running game you don't have to throw fifty times
sw3652A-ms98-a-0032 209.349250 216.372625 you know you know we're watching the Bowl games yesterday and there's some amazing Bowl games
sw3652A-ms98-a-0033 216.372625 230.106625 some of those guys'll be pros there's one fellow plays for my wife's school East Carolina named uh Jeff Blake and he's gonna [noise] almost surely be drafted by the pros he had an incredible day yesterday
sw3652A-ms98-a-0034 230.106625 235.617375 he um threw for four touchdown passes and ran for one and
sw3652A-ms98-a-0035 235.617375 248.495250 he had an amazing day he rallied the team down from seventeen points in the middle of the fourth quarter to score three unanswered touchdowns in less than six minutes it was an amazing performance
sw3652A-ms98-a-0036 248.495250 250.356875 [silence]
sw3652A-ms98-a-0037 250.356875 260.372125 it was Jeff Blake B L A K E he's the quarterback East Carolina he's pretty well rewritten the record books and i guess the pros will pay a good attention to him
sw3652A-ms98-a-0038 260.372125 264.321125 [silence]
sw3652A-ms98-a-0039 264.321125 268.144750 well they certainly came from behind to pull it off didn't they
sw3652A-ms98-a-0040 268.144750 276.199125 [silence]
sw3652A-ms98-a-0041 276.199125 284.374625 well both those games were the only two exciting Bowl games yesterday i think the other six games were either blowouts or like the Cotton Bowl a disaster
sw3652A-ms98-a-0042 284.374625 290.388125 but well it was it was a disaster a total disaster
sw3652A-ms98-a-0043 290.388125 292.392625 [silence]
sw3652A-ms98-a-0044 292.392625 298.626000 well i don't i don't know about Detroit they they've got a lot of injuries they may have beaten the Cowboys thirty four to to ten
