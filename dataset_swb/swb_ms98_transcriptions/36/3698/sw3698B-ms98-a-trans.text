sw3698B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.094250 [noise]
sw3698B-ms98-a-0002 1.094250 4.813875 [silence]
sw3698B-ms98-a-0003 4.813875 16.841250 yeah actually i i have quite a few thoughts on it before i became a mother i was going to law school because i wanted to change how our law system right now is working
sw3698B-ms98-a-0004 16.841250 19.207500 because_1 it's not
sw3698B-ms98-a-0005 19.207500 21.808625 it's not working correctly
sw3698B-ms98-a-0006 21.808625 23.984125 [silence]
sw3698B-ms98-a-0007 23.984125 38.926875 well i mean when they pi[ck]- like when they pick a jury they're supposed to have an equal or almost equal number of men and women to get different viewpoints and they don't have that because the women can't appear in court because they have take care of their kids
sw3698B-ms98-a-0008 38.926875 42.136250 so th[ey]- they end up having an all male jury
sw3698B-ms98-a-0009 42.136250 48.871250 [silence]
sw3698B-ms98-a-0010 48.871250 50.220000 yeah
sw3698B-ms98-a-0011 50.220000 51.775250 no they don't
sw3698B-ms98-a-0012 51.775250 52.780375 [silence]
sw3698B-ms98-a-0013 52.780375 60.981000 and a lot of women have to cancel their appearance and tell the judge hey i can't i've got two or three kids at home that need me you know
sw3698B-ms98-a-0014 60.981000 65.292250 and all the judge can do is say oh okay you're excused
sw3698B-ms98-a-0015 65.292250 73.762500 there's nothing the judge can do about it because_1 there's no law that says you know the judge has to help them with day care so he you know they don't bother
sw3698B-ms98-a-0016 73.762500 85.342750 and most of the juries if if anybody did a study of most of the juries they'd see that it's almost always an all male jury because women can't leave their kids
sw3698B-ms98-a-0017 85.342750 90.428250 and if they do get a woman on the jury she is beyond the age of fifty
sw3698B-ms98-a-0018 90.428250 105.330875 [silence]
sw3698B-ms98-a-0019 105.330875 120.056375 well i wanted to go to law school mainly for the purpose that if i was doing something in the legal profession i thought maybe if enough people knew about the problem maybe we could do something about it but then of course i got married and became a mother so
sw3698B-ms98-a-0020 120.056375 126.941000 it's kind of taking a back burner right now but i'm i still intend to finish law school i've got two years left
sw3698B-ms98-a-0021 126.941000 129.747625 over in Arizona A S U
sw3698B-ms98-a-0022 129.747625 131.234375 [silence]
sw3698B-ms98-a-0023 131.234375 133.624625 but i
sw3698B-ms98-a-0024 133.624625 136.517000 i just don't think it's very fair
sw3698B-ms98-a-0025 136.517000 146.949875 because_1 they say well it's all equal and you know we send papers to this many women yeah but how many do you actually pick because they can appear
sw3698B-ms98-a-0026 146.949875 154.622500 [silence]
sw3698B-ms98-a-0027 154.622500 156.961250 i don't think that's right
sw3698B-ms98-a-0028 156.961250 158.724875 i mean
sw3698B-ms98-a-0029 158.724875 163.197375 most judges that would be fine because_1 they're pretty open minded
sw3698B-ms98-a-0030 163.197375 170.497625 but if someone accidentally got a judge that wasn't and there are judges out there that are racist or prejudiced about one thing or another
sw3698B-ms98-a-0031 170.497625 174.889125 people could be convicted just because of personal feelings and i don't think that's right
sw3698B-ms98-a-0032 174.889125 178.119375 i think they need more views than just one
sw3698B-ms98-a-0033 178.119375 235.625875 [silence]
sw3698B-ms98-a-0034 235.625875 237.526250 and you'd miss school
sw3698B-ms98-a-0035 237.526250 243.129375 [silence]
sw3698B-ms98-a-0036 243.129375 245.281875 oh yeah no kidding
sw3698B-ms98-a-0037 245.281875 257.642625 [silence]
sw3698B-ms98-a-0038 257.642625 259.103125 yeah
sw3698B-ms98-a-0039 259.103125 290.923250 [silence]
