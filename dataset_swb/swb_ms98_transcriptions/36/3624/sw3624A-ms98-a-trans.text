sw3624A-ms98-a-0042 98.779375 109.621500 ou[t]- outdoor stage set up and so we do that every Sunday night during the summer yeah and then i don't know we just have an awful lot of engagements and we're just having to turn a lot of people down
sw3624A-ms98-a-0043 109.621500 116.922500 um because_1 you know uh we don't wanna do things like have a concert back to back or even two days in a row
sw3624A-ms98-a-0044 116.922500 119.280375 [silence]

sw3624A-ms98-a-0049 132.579875 135.117625 uh it really depends on who shows up
sw3624A-ms98-a-0050 135.117625 142.429375 um and it's always a mystery because it actually doesn't matter who shows up it matters what instruments they brought because so many people switch instruments so often
sw3624A-ms98-a-0051 142.429375 147.223125 but um yeah in the winter we do more concert stuff and

sw3624A-ms98-a-0081 236.622125 238.004875 uh
sw3624A-ms98-a-0082 238.004875 243.679750 yeah well it's more of a i think it's very much more of a social group than anything else you know
sw3624A-ms98-a-0083 243.679750 251.828875 um a[nd]- and people always bring refreshments for after rehearsal and hang around for an hour or so and that's probably why we get so many people
sw3624A-ms98-a-0084 251.828875 253.415125 [silence]
sw3624A-ms98-a-0085 253.415125 262.891500 um well the conductor gets paid a little bit you know we we do get some money from the city because we do play at a lot of city events um

sw3624A-ms98-a-0090 274.458250 282.911875 yeah it's a similar thing i can't remember what they call it but the same type of thing um but we do get an awful lot of music you know we can borrow music from any of the area colleges
sw3624A-ms98-a-0091 282.911875 289.762875 or you know if if some some group just isn't gonna play anymore they'll just give us their music and that type of thing
