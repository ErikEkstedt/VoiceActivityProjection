sw3687A-ms98-a-0023 99.744250 104.278250 [laughter] yeah definitely i wonder if he is he gonna stay with them or

sw3687A-ms98-a-0030 124.799250 130.591250 well i don't think anybody can i don't know if anybody's worth that much for what they do but uh
sw3687A-ms98-a-0031 130.591250 140.162625 i don't know i really i say i really hope the Braves can pull it through they're i think they caught everybody's imagination last year it was a it was great series but it'd been fun to see them_1 win it
sw3687A-ms98-a-0032 140.162625 145.379125 yeah that's true maybe they can pull it off again but i tell you i don't know it's

sw3687A-ms98-a-0038 158.608625 163.367875 well what do you think about the A's and Canseco and those guys have they got any chance or
sw3687A-ms98-a-0039 163.367875 165.593500 [silence]
sw3687A-ms98-a-0040 165.593500 170.754375 yeah i'm wondering if they're maybe just getting a little bit too high paid and thinking they're so good and
sw3687A-ms98-a-0041 170.754375 172.172500 pardon
sw3687A-ms98-a-0042 172.172500 175.445250 yeah that's true [laughter-that's] [laughter-definitely] true
sw3687A-ms98-a-0043 175.445250 178.098625 [silence]
sw3687A-ms98-a-0044 178.098625 186.919625 yep that's true got to get Canseco's mind off Madonna and then he might be able to play a little bit [laughter] [laughter-yeah] exactly
sw3687A-ms98-a-0045 186.919625 189.248500 [silence]
sw3687A-ms98-a-0046 189.248500 193.957750 yeah then they that's like they dropped off the map and they had all the same players but

sw3687A-ms98-a-0048 195.640875 204.186250 oh yeah that surprised me because_1 they were so tough and then i just i just wonder like i say if they lose the desire they did it once and then they just forget it and
sw3687A-ms98-a-0049 204.186250 206.264000 i don't know but uh
sw3687A-ms98-a-0050 206.264000 207.768625 [silence]

sw3687A-ms98-a-0053 211.350125 217.467750 yeah they just like i say they tailed right off but yeah i heard Davis was hurt quite a bit so that kind of hurt them_1
sw3687A-ms98-a-0054 217.467750 218.693125 [silence]
sw3687A-ms98-a-0055 218.693125 221.018375 yeah that's true
sw3687A-ms98-a-0056 221.018375 227.352125 yeah it'll be interesting to see what he does now that he's out there with his bud Strawberry and if all of a sudden he becomes healthy all the time 
sw3687A-ms98-a-0057 227.352125 231.685875 [silence]

sw3687A-ms98-a-0065 271.665250 275.414750 it would seem like it was always bigger on the inside than it was outside
sw3687A-ms98-a-0066 275.414750 282.433750 yeah i had all these hu[ge]- i we always were up in the nose bleed seats so we never got a chance to get too close but
