sw3671B-ms98-a-0002 0.978500 4.083750 [silence]
sw3671B-ms98-a-0003 4.083750 12.756500 the uh house i live in is fairly typical of the area it's one that uh my wife and i designed ourselves
sw3671B-ms98-a-0004 12.756500 14.645375 [silence]
sw3671B-ms98-a-0005 14.645375 19.607375 and we've been living in it now for thirty years so it must be okay [laughter]
sw3671B-ms98-a-0006 19.607375 37.082375 [silence]
sw3671B-ms98-a-0007 37.082375 41.925375 well in Texas we don't have basements very often i'm surprised you do in Utah
sw3671B-ms98-a-0008 41.925375 49.638875 [silence]
sw3671B-ms98-a-0009 49.638875 50.916000 so it's cold
sw3671B-ms98-a-0010 50.916000 54.270375 [silence]
sw3671B-ms98-a-0011 54.270375 55.277875 ah
sw3671B-ms98-a-0012 55.277875 62.475000 [silence]
sw3671B-ms98-a-0013 62.475000 65.273250 it is it air-conditioned
sw3671B-ms98-a-0014 65.273250 68.518000 so you're cool enough you don't need the air-conditioning
sw3671B-ms98-a-0015 68.518000 73.347000 [silence]
sw3671B-ms98-a-0016 73.347000 74.200750 uh
sw3671B-ms98-a-0017 74.200750 76.222500 [silence]
sw3671B-ms98-a-0018 76.222500 79.254625 well in Texas you can't hardly live without it
sw3671B-ms98-a-0019 79.254625 81.105500 [laughter]
sw3671B-ms98-a-0020 81.105500 83.311375 [silence]
sw3671B-ms98-a-0021 83.311375 93.135625 yeah we designed our house so the western exposure has a minimum number of windows so that the air-conditioning bill will be cheaper
sw3671B-ms98-a-0022 93.135625 113.657125 [silence]
sw3671B-ms98-a-0023 113.657125 124.104125 no actually uh uh it we we just started and we didn't like any of the houses we saw uh built they tended to have at the time we were building 
sw3671B-ms98-a-0024 124.104125 131.445875 very large uh bathrooms which i consider a waste of space since you spend so little time in the [laughter-bathroom]
sw3671B-ms98-a-0025 131.445875 143.708250 and uh also too much hall uh space we saw a home plan in Better Homes and Gardens about five years before we built this house that we liked
sw3671B-ms98-a-0026 143.708250 152.145000 except uh we wanted it a little bigger than uh uh it had two bedrooms that you could add on another bedroom
sw3671B-ms98-a-0027 152.145000 155.857625 and we wanted it arranged slightly differently
sw3671B-ms98-a-0028 155.857625 163.404375 i think if you looked at the floor plan now uh you probably wouldn't recognize where we started [laughter-from]
sw3671B-ms98-a-0029 163.404375 164.992250 [silence]
sw3671B-ms98-a-0030 164.992250 175.252000 but uh my wife likes a lot of cabinets in the kitchen and the original architect tried to talk us out of that and thank goodness we didn't let him talk us out of that
sw3671B-ms98-a-0031 175.252000 181.116125 and uh we wanted an entry way so that the living room
sw3671B-ms98-a-0032 181.116125 183.664750 did not have to be walked through
sw3671B-ms98-a-0033 183.664750 193.581625 the previous place we had lived in you always walked through the living room to get any place in the house and it was a traffic flow problem all the time
sw3671B-ms98-a-0034 193.581625 203.112125 so we have an entry way and i uh spend quite a little time in uh both when i was working and also even now retired
sw3671B-ms98-a-0035 203.112125 208.637375 in the study where i have a computer so we wanted a separate study and we have that
sw3671B-ms98-a-0036 208.637375 218.966000 and it has uh three bedrooms and we wanted it since our son we raised my wife's sister as our daughter so in effect we had two children but uh
sw3671B-ms98-a-0037 218.966000 228.350500 we wanted it so that we could leave the house to them uh when they had friends over and the normal noise that goes with such things so we have the
sw3671B-ms98-a-0038 228.350500 241.152625 master bedroom is arranged so that it is basic[ally]- basically a separate apartment in itself it has its own bath has its own patio porch type thing sliding doors and a very large room with
sw3671B-ms98-a-0039 241.152625 247.719875 a TV set so you could live back there by itself if [laughter-you] [laughter-wanted] [laughter-to] uh
sw3671B-ms98-a-0040 247.719875 255.380875 [silence]
sw3671B-ms98-a-0041 255.380875 260.409500 oh that's i don't know uh with our previous house didn't have it and uh
sw3671B-ms98-a-0042 260.409500 264.568375 now that we've got it we we think we couldn't live without it you know [laughter]
sw3671B-ms98-a-0043 264.568375 266.705125 [laughter]
sw3671B-ms98-a-0044 266.705125 271.933250 [silence]
sw3671B-ms98-a-0045 271.933250 274.291875 yeah my wife does also
