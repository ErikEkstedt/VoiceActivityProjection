sw3672B-ms98-a-0003 2.495375 12.302625 well as a science teacher i been encouraging recycling for a long time and uh we collect things at school such as foil 
sw3672B-ms98-a-0004 12.302625 25.338000 and cans and glass to a certain extent uh i coach an OM team and we save everything the kids at school bring some things in but not as much as i'd like and i have recyclings bins at home 
sw3672B-ms98-a-0005 25.338000 32.584625 and we've had a uh we save foil which i think a lot of people don't realize they could sell along with the al[uminum]- i mean aluminum cans
sw3672B-ms98-a-0006 32.584625 40.433375 [silence]
sw3672B-ms98-a-0007 40.433375 51.497375 well Reynold's aluminum has this big balls of foil competition thing going and i don't know where we're supposed to turn it in another science teacher at school is in charge of that and 
sw3672B-ms98-a-0008 51.497375 57.125750 got all the materials on it but we're saving foil and accumulating balls of foil in our room 
sw3672B-ms98-a-0009 57.125750 58.907875 [laughter]
sw3672B-ms98-a-0010 58.907875 61.531500 [silence]
sw3672B-ms98-a-0011 61.531500 73.330875 not yet i[t]- it is in some communities but it isn't here and it is experimental in some areas at this point they're trying it out and deciding wh[at]- what they're gonna do with it 
sw3672B-ms98-a-0012 73.330875 86.668375 [silence]
sw3672B-ms98-a-0013 86.668375 88.288750 that's true
sw3672B-ms98-a-0014 88.288750 94.058250 my husband gets irritated sometimes because of the even though i bought recycling bins 
sw3672B-ms98-a-0015 94.058250 103.536250 and we keep our cans in one thing and glass in another and paper in another it once it gets full getting it loaded into the car and taking it is a pain 
sw3672B-ms98-a-0016 103.536250 111.876875 yeah and uh sometimes you go to those recycling places and like with cans often times there's a long line 
sw3672B-ms98-a-0017 111.876875 116.089375 uh you know if it's one of those where you get change for your cans
sw3672B-ms98-a-0018 116.089375 125.987250 now if it's just a donation type of thing like at the library or some places like that sometimes people'll just dump their stuff at right at the front they don't go to the back of the
sw3672B-ms98-a-0019 125.987250 128.467125 like if it's a truck or whatever for paper
sw3672B-ms98-a-0020 128.467125 136.285375 and then everything's just starts getting piled outside which is a pain because that's not what's supposed to be [laughter-happening]
sw3672B-ms98-a-0021 136.285375 138.651000 [silence]
sw3672B-ms98-a-0022 138.651000 148.863875 i think so too i i am uh in hopes that that will be successful and that they will decide to go ahead and and spread it to our neighborhood as well 
sw3672B-ms98-a-0023 148.863875 162.015500 [silence]
sw3672B-ms98-a-0024 162.015500 163.357625 um-hum
sw3672B-ms98-a-0025 163.357625 166.462125 [silence]
sw3672B-ms98-a-0026 166.462125 168.146375 that's true
sw3672B-ms98-a-0027 168.146375 174.219375 [silence]
sw3672B-ms98-a-0028 174.219375 180.621625 some of them are recyclable and i started trying to save those but we couldn't find a place to dump them_1
sw3672B-ms98-a-0029 180.621625 184.606250 and so we just had to throw them_1 away um
sw3672B-ms98-a-0030 184.606250 193.902375 [silence]
sw3672B-ms98-a-0031 193.902375 196.270500 well i think 
sw3672B-ms98-a-0032 196.270500 209.391500 i was talking to someone who lives really almost on the other side of town said she knew of one place where you could go and so once a month they made this trek with all their recyclables but they also have a pickup
sw3672B-ms98-a-0033 209.391500 217.961875 uh a[nd]- and they would take everything but that is it used to be such a pain and it's so far away from us and that's the only one she knew of 
sw3672B-ms98-a-0034 217.961875 219.660625 [silence]
sw3672B-ms98-a-0035 219.660625 230.563250 so i- i guess what we've decided is that we're doing our part by recycling three and going out of our a[rea]- way but to have to go clear [laughter-across] [laughter-town] for plastic because_1 
sw3672B-ms98-a-0036 230.563250 236.122375 [silence]
sw3672B-ms98-a-0037 236.122375 242.678375 and there's a a little booklet called uh Fifty Thin[gs]- Fifty Ways You Can Save The Earth have you read that
sw3672B-ms98-a-0038 242.678375 246.565000 yes well i read some of those to the kids from time to time
sw3672B-ms98-a-0039 246.565000 254.141875 so that they get some of the ideas uh from that but they are a lot more into recycling than they used to be um
sw3672B-ms98-a-0040 254.141875 258.705125 the th[e]- children uh-huh because i teach middle school
sw3672B-ms98-a-0041 258.705125 265.207875 and it's uh surprising some of them_1 aren't but that probably goes right into their families
sw3672B-ms98-a-0042 265.207875 275.454250 but there are even groups of parents that are Recycling Coalition type deal where they're really making speeches to the PTA and the Dad's Club and everything trying to get more parents involved 
sw3672B-ms98-a-0043 275.454250 277.435875 so it's um
sw3672B-ms98-a-0044 277.435875 283.392875 [noise] it it's on its way if we could get more support through the public utilities 
sw3672B-ms98-a-0045 283.392875 299.522000 [silence]
