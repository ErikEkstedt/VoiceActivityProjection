sw3672A-ms98-a-0014 72.318750 79.116375 we just started it this year and it's really nice to be able to have that convenience as opposed to having to go to a local 
sw3672A-ms98-a-0015 79.116375 89.608625 dump and you know take your recyclables i know that i am much more motivated [laughter] when i know that they'll come pick it up because there can be so much that you load in your car as to as to when i had to get

sw3672A-ms98-a-0028 134.256750 139.349000 right it seems like it would be better all the way around if there were more curbside recycling

sw3672A-ms98-a-0033 160.946625 169.377625 those big milk tubs and that constitutes a big portion of our trash so i would hope at some point those things would either 
sw3672A-ms98-a-0034 169.377625 175.178125 stop being manufactured or that that they would be able to figure out a way to recycle those economically
