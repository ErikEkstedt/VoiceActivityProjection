sw3605B-ms98-a-0005 8.495625 9.675250 [laughter-well]
sw3605B-ms98-a-0006 9.675250 14.103250 uh seeing as how i'm sixty four i- i- i've seen them_1 all
sw3605B-ms98-a-0007 14.103250 18.620000 yeah from the time that i was in in college in the forties
sw3605B-ms98-a-0008 18.620000 30.744125 when the majors that were open to women were well we could major in business but that meant that it we would either teach school be secretaries or bookkeepers not accountants just bookkeepers
sw3605B-ms98-a-0009 30.744125 33.061625 our um
sw3605B-ms98-a-0010 33.061625 42.349250 let's see well we could have gone well i went to Abilene Christian College now University and we didn't have nurses training
sw3605B-ms98-a-0011 42.349250 45.794125 so being a school teacher a secretary bookkeeper or nurse
sw3605B-ms98-a-0012 45.794125 53.673375 were about the only occupations open to women and uh i- i've seen the generation change uh
sw3605B-ms98-a-0013 53.673375 59.946125 i belong to the Altrusa Club of Dallas and uh we extended and uh
sw3605B-ms98-a-0014 59.946125 64.374750 uh started a club called the Altrusa Club of Downtown Dallas
sw3605B-ms98-a-0015 64.374750 72.006125 and the average age is oh i don't know thirty five i guess early thirties maybe
sw3605B-ms98-a-0016 72.006125 75.360875 [noise] uh and i've seen
sw3605B-ms98-a-0017 75.360875 87.213375 uh uh the the women's occupations change to everything engineering doctors accountants CPA's
sw3605B-ms98-a-0018 87.213375 90.819250 uh anything you wanna name
sw3605B-ms98-a-0019 90.819250 91.840750 [silence]
sw3605B-ms98-a-0020 91.840750 98.283375 so i- i think that trend will continue into the future uh and i- i think that
sw3605B-ms98-a-0021 98.283375 104.726000 unfortunately one of the fall outs is that these young women that were
sw3605B-ms98-a-0022 104.726000 116.852625 tha[t]- that o[f]- of my day that the young women school teachers were so bright and so capable that they're now the lawyers and accountants and the doctors
sw3605B-ms98-a-0023 116.852625 117.867750 [silence]
sw3605B-ms98-a-0024 117.867750 120.657250 and they're not [laughter-teaching] [laughter-school] any more
sw3605B-ms98-a-0025 120.657250 128.851750 and i don't think anybody has focused on on that and has seen that as one of the causes of the deterioration in our school system 
sw3605B-ms98-a-0026 128.851750 136.632750 [silence]
sw3605B-ms98-a-0027 136.632750 139.307750 oh i agree with you

sw3605B-ms98-a-0032 147.987500 153.741875 and when i got out of law school out of the seventy graduates there were three women
sw3605B-ms98-a-0033 153.741875 162.467375 and now out at SMU it's somewhere between forty and fifty percent uh of the students are women
sw3605B-ms98-a-0034 162.467375 166.177000 and i- i'm sure that trend will continue
sw3605B-ms98-a-0035 166.177000 170.047750 a[nd]- and uh there were no women preachers of course
sw3605B-ms98-a-0036 170.047750 175.846000 [laughter] [laughter-when] [laughter-i] [laughter-w[as]-] was coming along and uh uh 
sw3605B-ms98-a-0037 175.846000 180.031000 oh this has been oh ten years ago i guess
sw3605B-ms98-a-0038 180.031000 186.759500 i was at a luncheon and uh uh it just happened that i sat next to a Methodist preacher
sw3605B-ms98-a-0039 186.759500 190.177500 and i said we Catholics are running out of priests
sw3605B-ms98-a-0040 190.177500 199.808250 uh how are you all making out he said well if it were not for the fact that roughly thirty percent of the entering class at Perkins uh
sw3605B-ms98-a-0041 199.808250 204.501875 School out at SMU we'd be running out
sw3605B-ms98-a-0042 204.501875 211.458500 so i now i don't know i d[on't]- i don't think i'll see women priests in my church in [laughter-my] [laughter-lifetime]
