sw3693A-ms98-a-0025 78.036000 79.338250 [silence]
sw3693A-ms98-a-0026 79.338250 88.893000 well i I have two kids and uh five and six a girl and a boy and um so far i haven't had to make a lot of child care arrangements for them_1 because um
sw3693A-ms98-a-0027 88.893000 98.125875 i'm at home now full time but um when i was going to school i would go to school a time that my husband wasn't you know when he was at home
sw3693A-ms98-a-0028 98.125875 107.486000 so that we would just switch back and forth like that but um it's really scary and i would really hate to be in a position to have to find child [laughter-care]
sw3693A-ms98-a-0029 107.486000 111.600125 [silence]
sw3693A-ms98-a-0030 111.600125 112.930500 um-hum

sw3693A-ms98-a-0035 124.993875 133.870250 [silence]
sw3693A-ms98-a-0036 133.870250 135.182875 um
sw3693A-ms98-a-0037 135.182875 138.439875 [silence]
sw3693A-ms98-a-0038 138.439875 140.299750 well that's nice
sw3693A-ms98-a-0039 140.299750 144.396750 and i know that i have um done some babysitting myself
sw3693A-ms98-a-0040 144.396750 157.329875 and uh when i was in school and needed extra money and i know how i feel how i felt as a provider of child care that even though you're you're taking care of someone else's child and you're forcing yourself to
sw3693A-ms98-a-0041 157.329875 170.137750 you know treat them equally and you know better [laughter-usually] better than your own um it's not the same and it made me realize that um no one will love your child as much as you and your mother your
sw3693A-ms98-a-0042 170.137750 177.202875 and um the family and no one will look out after them and i just think um
sw3693A-ms98-a-0043 177.202875 182.055500 so far i think my preference would be rather than to have like a
sw3693A-ms98-a-0044 182.055500 192.659125 oh a big day care that um what is that like chil[d]- KinderCare and things like that rather than having one where they would deliver the children to school in a van or something
sw3693A-ms98-a-0045 192.659125 198.328500 i would prefer to have in home care either my own home or a neighbor or something
sw3693A-ms98-a-0046 198.328500 204.525000 [silence]
sw3693A-ms98-a-0047 204.525000 205.818875 uh-huh
sw3693A-ms98-a-0048 205.818875 215.160875 [silence]
sw3693A-ms98-a-0049 215.160875 216.774625 right
sw3693A-ms98-a-0050 216.774625 218.153875 [silence]
sw3693A-ms98-a-0051 218.153875 219.757875 it is hard
sw3693A-ms98-a-0052 219.757875 227.949375 [silence]
sw3693A-ms98-a-0053 227.949375 229.309375 no
sw3693A-ms98-a-0054 229.309375 231.779500 [silence]
sw3693A-ms98-a-0055 231.779500 233.437750 no
sw3693A-ms98-a-0056 233.437750 246.607500 and i know um when i pick my kids up from school they wanna come home and i and i would hate for them to ha[ve]- be picked up by a day care and be taken to another large group situation
sw3693A-ms98-a-0057 246.607500 256.711125 so i think uh my preference would be a small small if i had to find day care would be a small someone that i knew [laughter]
sw3693A-ms98-a-0058 256.711125 258.424750 um-hum
sw3693A-ms98-a-0059 258.424750 265.962750 [silence]

sw3693A-ms98-a-0061 267.511625 276.413250 [silence]
sw3693A-ms98-a-0062 276.413250 283.972875 well that's true because even now when they're gone to school it seems like there's just not enough time left over in the day
sw3693A-ms98-a-0063 283.972875 285.535750 [silence]
sw3693A-ms98-a-0064 285.535750 297.172500 and uh by the time they have to eat and have homework and they want some free time and there's just not enough to time in the day to do anything good quality for them
sw3693A-ms98-a-0065 297.172500 298.562000 but that's really
