sw3693B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.753750 [noise] 
sw3693B-ms98-a-0002 0.753750 3.213875 yes i have a twelve year old 
sw3693B-ms98-a-0003 3.213875 12.679875 and i've been very lucky i haven't needed child care except for my mom [laughter-so] i've been real lucky i'm a nurse i go to school i mean i go to work early
sw3693B-ms98-a-0004 12.679875 23.510625 so my mom comes over in the morning and gets her ready for his school or just hangs by while she gets ready drives her to school then i'm home to pick her up so i'm very very lucky [laughter]
sw3693B-ms98-a-0005 23.510625 28.832125 [silence]
sw3693B-ms98-a-0006 28.832125 40.138625 well i could do it now but she gets lonely in the morning and i feel better um she has a crazy father out there somewhere that i just don't let her out of my sight so
sw3693B-ms98-a-0007 40.138625 41.464750 um
sw3693B-ms98-a-0008 41.464750 50.763500 you never know yeah yeah she feels that way you know and we have a neighbor on the next block that she could always walk over there and go to school with but
sw3693B-ms98-a-0009 50.763500 61.505625 we just feel better doing it this way so i don't know what day we'll stop we we were about to stop one day this year and then her father called the school and made all kinds of threats and so
sw3693B-ms98-a-0010 61.505625 72.608750 we didn't stop and so [laughter] so um you know it you realize that it only takes one second for something to happen so even though she's twelve she's still a kid so
sw3693B-ms98-a-0011 72.608750 75.306250 you got to be careful [laughter]
sw3693B-ms98-a-0012 75.306250 76.898625 [silence]
sw3693B-ms98-a-0013 76.898625 80.693625 yeah i'm i'm glad too [laughter]

sw3693B-ms98-a-0019 98.918875 105.732875 [silence]
sw3693B-ms98-a-0020 105.732875 113.115875 well i would too because even though a place can look pretty good on the outside we're finding out now that it's not always on the inside and
sw3693B-ms98-a-0021 113.115875 127.573375 and i i just don't know what i would do if i had to do that i know the hospital that i work in is big hospital and they provide child care and of course they charge for it but at least all the nurses can leave their children and
sw3693B-ms98-a-0022 127.573375 138.566250 they're always watching them they can eat lunch with them if they feel sick they can call them_1 at work and they run over and check on them_1 and they feel a little better than if they dropped them off somewhere on the way
sw3693B-ms98-a-0023 138.566250 141.253250 so yeah it is nice
sw3693B-ms98-a-0024 141.253250 160.565750 [silence]
sw3693B-ms98-a-0025 160.565750 162.780000 right [laughter-right]
sw3693B-ms98-a-0026 162.780000 167.151000 [silence]
sw3693B-ms98-a-0027 167.151000 169.047250 well that's right
sw3693B-ms98-a-0028 169.047250 170.744500 yeah right
sw3693B-ms98-a-0029 170.744500 187.150375 [silence]

sw3693B-ms98-a-0031 188.672500 196.250875 [silence]
sw3693B-ms98-a-0032 196.250875 205.424500 yeah yeah just never know i babysat for the little girl next door for a year or so when her parents first got divorced and
sw3693B-ms98-a-0033 205.424500 211.896125 it it was hard to treat her equally with my child they were the same age and they played together and they were good friends
sw3693B-ms98-a-0034 211.896125 221.809125 but like you said you tend to go more for the other one's side just because you are responsible and so it it got hard and my daughter got jealous and
sw3693B-ms98-a-0035 221.809125 234.464750 um it just wasn't the same as when they were just playing as friends because she had to be there every day so i stopped that after a year because it was difficult to balance it so
sw3693B-ms98-a-0036 234.464750 238.671750 [silence]
sw3693B-ms98-a-0037 238.671750 240.970000 they do

sw3693B-ms98-a-0043 253.105750 254.679375 [silence]
sw3693B-ms98-a-0044 254.679375 264.840500 yeah well i would rather do without some things and i know that some parents they both do have to work but a lot of people where i live are working just because they want bigger and better
sw3693B-ms98-a-0045 264.840500 277.034000 and i would never do that i never have done it and i just never would do it i would rather do without some things that really aren't very important compared to being with my child when they're growing up so
sw3693B-ms98-a-0046 277.034000 282.083750 [silence]
