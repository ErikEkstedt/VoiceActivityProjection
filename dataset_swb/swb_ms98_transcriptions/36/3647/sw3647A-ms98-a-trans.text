sw3647A-ms98-a-0020 54.995500 58.964000 [silence]
sw3647A-ms98-a-0021 58.964000 60.621125 uh-huh
sw3647A-ms98-a-0022 60.621125 62.869125 oh [laughter]
sw3647A-ms98-a-0023 62.869125 64.226625 uh-huh
sw3647A-ms98-a-0024 64.226625 66.754000 [silence]

sw3647A-ms98-a-0026 68.913750 77.478750 [silence]
sw3647A-ms98-a-0027 77.478750 80.849750 to to compensate for some of the benefits oh
sw3647A-ms98-a-0028 80.849750 84.203000 [silence]
sw3647A-ms98-a-0029 84.203000 85.386500 yes
sw3647A-ms98-a-0030 85.386500 90.078375 [silence]
sw3647A-ms98-a-0031 90.078375 95.321750 well -[th]at's that's an excellent so actually that is a benefit uh
sw3647A-ms98-a-0032 95.321750 99.161125 [laughter]
sw3647A-ms98-a-0033 99.161125 100.315250 yeah
sw3647A-ms98-a-0034 100.315250 104.505125 [silence]
sw3647A-ms98-a-0035 104.505125 106.002875 right right
sw3647A-ms98-a-0036 106.002875 113.554500 well i guess that's a good point uh i do belong to a a large corporation or my that where i'm currently employed
sw3647A-ms98-a-0037 113.554500 126.323500 and there's uh there's some different things uh one that you've already mentioned is is health insurance i think through our health insurance that i can get better rates as a through a group plan
sw3647A-ms98-a-0038 126.323500 135.427375 as opposed to going out and getting health insurance on an individual basis because i had to do that at one time when i wasn't employed with a large corporation
sw3647A-ms98-a-0039 135.427375 145.137250 and that got to be somewhat expensive and so i- i think one of the benefits i- i see is the uh is the group uh group discount
sw3647A-ms98-a-0040 145.137250 146.308625 [silence]
sw3647A-ms98-a-0041 146.308625 147.581875 yeah
sw3647A-ms98-a-0042 147.581875 151.350250 [laughter] -[a]nd yes and that's that's one thing i do have
sw3647A-ms98-a-0043 151.350250 160.878750 if i didn't have a family i don't think i would have as as a male or as a as an individual of in this stage of my life i don't think i would have insurance uh other
sw3647A-ms98-a-0044 160.878750 173.954125 i don't think i would go through that expense one other benefit that you mentioned is the flexible work hours and in my previous job i really enjoyed because they had what was called a flex schedule
sw3647A-ms98-a-0045 173.954125 188.252250 where i could go and i could work uh nine hour days and have like Friday only work four hours or i could do uh work four days a week at ten hours a day and have a f[our]- you know three w[eek]- day weekend
sw3647A-ms98-a-0046 188.252250 192.299375 and make uh make my job flexible in that case
sw3647A-ms98-a-0047 192.299375 196.294000 [silence]
sw3647A-ms98-a-0048 196.294000 203.344125 well basically yeah i had to do that uh the same uh for about every quarter of the year i mean
sw3647A-ms98-a-0049 203.344125 212.370750 uh because i was in a in a position of management i had responsibilities over people that uh i needed to make my schedule uh
sw3647A-ms98-a-0050 212.370750 217.965250 so that if i was not there i would have coverage by some other management personnel so
sw3647A-ms98-a-0051 217.965250 226.903750 so i- i think that uh that was a that was an excellent benefit that i really enjoyed and i don't c[urrently]- have that in my current operation but uh
sw3647A-ms98-a-0052 226.903750 230.686375 you mentioned uh flexible work schedule and that's that's good
sw3647A-ms98-a-0053 230.686375 234.607000 and uh what other benefits do you think are important
sw3647A-ms98-a-0054 234.607000 236.984000 [silence]
sw3647A-ms98-a-0055 236.984000 238.121625 [laughter]
sw3647A-ms98-a-0056 238.121625 241.103750 [silence]
sw3647A-ms98-a-0057 241.103750 243.508875 yeah yeah that's true
sw3647A-ms98-a-0058 243.508875 249.160125 [silence]
sw3647A-ms98-a-0059 249.160125 252.374875 well and that's an individual thing
sw3647A-ms98-a-0060 252.374875 265.540125 yeah with uh with our current uh organization we do have a nice retirement package and also a a nice thing that that we have in our corporation is a uh is a profit sharing plan
sw3647A-ms98-a-0061 265.540125 280.283500 where we can uh participate in the the profits of the company if we're you know if we've been there a while and we're vested uh which means that you know we have a an interest uh in the company that we can
sw3647A-ms98-a-0062 280.283500 288.785625 [vocalized-noise] uh get some of the benefits of the either the profit high times or or in a sense suffer during the low times
sw3647A-ms98-a-0063 288.785625 300.066000 and uh also uh in one of my wife's uh companies where she worked they'd had a real nice profit sharing plan that that eff[ectively]- they made a cer[tain]-
