sw3684B-ms98-a-0036 130.105625 137.011875 it seems like you can get the same menu for lunch cheap have you ever tried that just going for lunch and then
sw3684B-ms98-a-0037 137.011875 138.756750 [silence]

sw3684B-ms98-a-0045 164.842625 169.494125 in almost any restaurant that's almost the case that we've seen
sw3684B-ms98-a-0046 169.494125 173.746000 [silence]
sw3684B-ms98-a-0047 173.746000 175.587750 yeah
sw3684B-ms98-a-0048 175.587750 179.234125 probably price would be first [noise]
sw3684B-ms98-a-0049 179.234125 192.344625 um we're not [vocalized-noise] you know we seems like we're always r[ushing]- rushing around doing something so location that would have a lot to do with it too i mean we don't really travel to Mesquite or you know somewhere that takes half an hour to get there so
sw3684B-ms98-a-0050 192.344625 197.757125 we've you know tried most of the places around here and that's kind of where we stay
sw3684B-ms98-a-0051 197.757125 201.888500 [silence]
sw3684B-ms98-a-0052 201.888500 203.707125 oh gee

sw3684B-ms98-a-0054 208.762250 210.315875 [silence]
sw3684B-ms98-a-0055 210.315875 221.649875 those are good and it's kind of Cajun i usually don't like spicy food but that's real good especially lunch you know bec[ause]- for the same reason because_1 it's got some atmosphere and yet the price is is good
sw3684B-ms98-a-0056 221.649875 227.630250 my husband really likes Chinese food so we go Chinese just a little mom and pop kind of places
sw3684B-ms98-a-0057 227.630250 229.763625 more so than the bigger
sw3684B-ms98-a-0058 229.763625 234.877000 [silence]
sw3684B-ms98-a-0059 234.877000 236.207375 yeah

sw3684B-ms98-a-0062 239.088625 240.133375 [silence]
sw3684B-ms98-a-0063 240.133375 246.030750 Chinese places [vocalized-noise] doesn't seem like they really cater to atmosphere [laughter] the ones around here anyways just
sw3684B-ms98-a-0064 246.030750 250.220500 just authentic that's all [laughter-it] you know it says authentic on the outside
sw3684B-ms98-a-0065 250.220500 256.432125 [silence]
sw3684B-ms98-a-0066 256.432125 258.676000 no not necessarily
sw3684B-ms98-a-0067 258.676000 266.763625 um when i go out with my husband i just want to be able to to talk to him so that doesn't lend itself to that and when i'm with my children
sw3684B-ms98-a-0068 266.763625 275.439125 the more noise there is the more [nose/noise] noise they think they can make [laughter] [laughter-so] [laughter-it] [laughter-doesn't] it tends to make them wilder so
sw3684B-ms98-a-0069 275.439125 280.739875 i really like the Black-Eyed Pea but i also think that's real noisy have you ever been to a Black-Eyed Pea
sw3684B-ms98-a-0070 280.739875 287.310750 it's got such a open atmosphere and clanking and banging that i love the food but it is really noisy
sw3684B-ms98-a-0071 287.310750 295.212875 [silence]
sw3684B-ms98-a-0072 295.212875 299.394000 no i think that's pretty much what makes me go ba[ck]-
