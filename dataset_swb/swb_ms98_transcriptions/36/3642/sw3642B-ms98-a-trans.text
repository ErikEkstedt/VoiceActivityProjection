sw3642B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 2.804500 [noise] so w[hat]- well what do you think
sw3642B-ms98-a-0002 2.804500 65.612875 [silence]
sw3642B-ms98-a-0003 65.612875 67.148250 um-hum
sw3642B-ms98-a-0004 67.148250 68.936625 [silence]
sw3642B-ms98-a-0005 68.936625 80.032500 well i agree that it's a big task but i think that i think that the US should move towards some kind of national health care plan
sw3642B-ms98-a-0006 80.032500 83.771250 at least as a long term kind of goal
sw3642B-ms98-a-0007 83.771250 85.596500 you know possibly
sw3642B-ms98-a-0008 85.596500 94.799125 you know just starting with more regulation of health insurance and that sort of thing but i think that ultimately it would be
sw3642B-ms98-a-0009 94.799125 97.613625 a good idea to
sw3642B-ms98-a-0010 97.613625 101.669875 um and not have a completely socialized
sw3642B-ms98-a-0011 101.669875 108.477125 medical system in the country but maybe something about halfway between that and what we have now
sw3642B-ms98-a-0012 108.477125 114.846000 it um just because it seems that
sw3642B-ms98-a-0013 114.846000 123.151500 um health insurance costs are sky rocketing well as fast as the national deficit
sw3642B-ms98-a-0014 123.151500 126.503250 perhaps and so that's
sw3642B-ms98-a-0015 126.503250 130.715000 and that's a that's a vicious cycle of course
sw3642B-ms98-a-0016 130.715000 132.051375 because
sw3642B-ms98-a-0017 132.051375 148.609875 [silence]
sw3642B-ms98-a-0018 148.609875 149.955375 um
sw3642B-ms98-a-0019 149.955375 151.342375 well
sw3642B-ms98-a-0020 151.342375 153.176250 i um
sw3642B-ms98-a-0021 153.176250 154.413250 [silence]
sw3642B-ms98-a-0022 154.413250 164.958875 well i wouldn't exclude the possibility of the government actually administrating it ultimately i don't think that that would necessarily be such a bad idea
sw3642B-ms98-a-0023 164.958875 166.464750 and
sw3642B-ms98-a-0024 166.464750 168.776000 [noise] um [noise]
sw3642B-ms98-a-0025 168.776000 188.951750 [silence]
sw3642B-ms98-a-0026 188.951750 190.958250 [vocalized-noise] right
sw3642B-ms98-a-0027 190.958250 197.251625 [silence]
sw3642B-ms98-a-0028 197.251625 209.552125 the well as it is now the middle and upper classes are paying more than their share for the health care of the whole country because they're the only people that can afford health insurance
sw3642B-ms98-a-0029 209.552125 218.629000 and so that the other people have no health insurance and you know they'll get medical care anyway at least in emergencies
sw3642B-ms98-a-0030 218.629000 222.539375 and somebody winds up paying for that and
sw3642B-ms98-a-0031 222.539375 228.261375 basically the people paying for it are the people who are buying health insurance
sw3642B-ms98-a-0032 228.261375 230.579000 so i do not see that anything
sw3642B-ms98-a-0033 230.579000 234.954875 this situation would get any worse that way it might get better
sw3642B-ms98-a-0034 234.954875 237.695000 [silence]
sw3642B-ms98-a-0035 237.695000 239.116375 um-hum [laughter]
sw3642B-ms98-a-0036 239.116375 248.202125 [silence]

sw3642B-ms98-a-0040 297.085500 298.562000 yeah well i thin[k]-
