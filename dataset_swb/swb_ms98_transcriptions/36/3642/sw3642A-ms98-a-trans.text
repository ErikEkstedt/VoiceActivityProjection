sw3642A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.402375 [noise] hi
sw3642A-ms98-a-0002 0.402375 1.514375 [silence]
sw3642A-ms98-a-0003 1.514375 2.802625 well
sw3642A-ms98-a-0004 2.802625 13.490250 providing universal health care insurance for the whole country is a pretty big task and i uh personally i don't approve of it for two reasons number one 
sw3642A-ms98-a-0005 13.490250 17.029750 is that i think that uh the federal government
sw3642A-ms98-a-0006 17.029750 24.397125 has a problem with the deficit right now and if they were to administer this they would uh [laughter-get] us more and more into debt
sw3642A-ms98-a-0007 24.397125 33.494375 further than we can ever get out ourselves number two i think that the quality of health care would go down because the competition would
sw3642A-ms98-a-0008 33.494375 42.536500 would be dried up and really no one would be would only answer to to the government to a big bur[eaucratic]- bureaucratic mess
sw3642A-ms98-a-0009 42.536500 47.695625 and uh i've seen what it has done in other countries and so i don't think uh
sw3642A-ms98-a-0010 47.695625 59.791875 i don't think we should head in that direction although that we have problems right now and i do agree that they exist because health care insurance for for everyone
sw3642A-ms98-a-0011 59.791875 66.230000 is skyrocketing and it's become to a point where basically no one can afford it anymore
sw3642A-ms98-a-0012 66.230000 69.044375 how do you feel about the wh[ole]- whole ordeal
sw3642A-ms98-a-0013 69.044375 82.824000 [silence]
sw3642A-ms98-a-0014 82.824000 84.205125 um-hum
sw3642A-ms98-a-0015 84.205125 101.357375 [silence]
sw3642A-ms98-a-0016 101.357375 102.818375 [laughter]
sw3642A-ms98-a-0017 102.818375 104.038750 uh-huh
sw3642A-ms98-a-0018 104.038750 107.997625 [silence]
sw3642A-ms98-a-0019 107.997625 109.450875 okay
sw3642A-ms98-a-0020 109.450875 122.392500 [silence]
sw3642A-ms98-a-0021 122.392500 123.950500 oh yes
sw3642A-ms98-a-0022 123.950500 127.261125 [silence]
sw3642A-ms98-a-0023 127.261125 129.872625 but what what you're think
sw3642A-ms98-a-0024 129.872625 136.775750 yeah so what you're saying though is instead of having the national govern[ment]- government administer
sw3642A-ms98-a-0025 136.775750 144.791750 giving health insurance to every man woman and child with throughout the whole company you see more of them as regulating the high costs
sw3642A-ms98-a-0026 144.791750 148.343250 uh that people are forced to pay for it right now
sw3642A-ms98-a-0027 148.343250 151.269875 is that is that correct or do you think that
sw3642A-ms98-a-0028 151.269875 168.493750 [silence]
sw3642A-ms98-a-0029 168.493750 180.265750 well with the with the costs as they are right now do you think that the government uh because what that would require is for us to pay uh more taxes and the 
sw3642A-ms98-a-0030 180.265750 193.339250 the in[come]- the people that can afford taxes the middle income and the upper income will be paying more ca[sh]- taxes to to pay for health insurance for everyone whereas right now the the public themselves
sw3642A-ms98-a-0031 193.339250 199.092875 get health insurance and they provide their own health insurance
sw3642A-ms98-a-0032 199.092875 218.579000 [silence]
sw3642A-ms98-a-0033 218.579000 219.952250 [vocalized-noise]
sw3642A-ms98-a-0034 219.952250 234.079125 [silence]
sw3642A-ms98-a-0035 234.079125 241.874375 you think it might b[e]- get better huh i i kind of disagree [laughter] the reason being is uh
sw3642A-ms98-a-0036 241.874375 248.975125 we have i don't know i guess it's my my fear of the national government and also because the bureaucratic
sw3642A-ms98-a-0037 248.975125 255.043250 rules that it would take to administer it and um
sw3642A-ms98-a-0038 255.043250 264.467625 the the health insurance companies right now pretty much regulate and are pretty picky and and uh don't allow
sw3642A-ms98-a-0039 264.467625 276.901500 cases where they might throw them out of business whereas the federal government if they took over everything they wouldn't care because they'll never go out of business people would still have to pay taxes the money would have to come from somewhere
sw3642A-ms98-a-0040 276.901500 281.600500 and so you'd s[ee]- i i feel that the cost would increase
sw3642A-ms98-a-0041 281.600500 293.610250 dramatically also but in the same sense the the care and the the attitude of the doctors and the professionals within the medical uh field
sw3642A-ms98-a-0042 293.610250 295.712625 would would diminish
sw3642A-ms98-a-0043 295.712625 298.562000 um i
