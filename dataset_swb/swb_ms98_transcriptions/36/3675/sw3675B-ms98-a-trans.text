sw3675B-ms98-a-0006 7.996250 14.279250 [laughter-we're] we're at the point now i i uh i quit working about six months ago to start this house 
sw3675B-ms98-a-0007 14.279250 18.283000 and i'm out of cash and i'm not out of project yet
sw3675B-ms98-a-0008 18.283000 25.288875 so uh i'm gonna go back and do some consulting work as far as budget's concerned i'm
sw3675B-ms98-a-0009 25.288875 28.541000 i'm fairly fortunate uh we've
sw3675B-ms98-a-0010 28.541000 33.798500 we're right now where if we don't buy anything extra we can make it on what my wife makes
sw3675B-ms98-a-0011 33.798500 35.170375 so
sw3675B-ms98-a-0012 35.170375 38.027375 uh the project's kind of halted until then
sw3675B-ms98-a-0013 38.027375 48.340500 as far as budgeting is concerned you know we have uh some pretty strict guidelines that we go for you know we always put ten percent back
sw3675B-ms98-a-0014 48.340500 51.011625 and that's a never touch
sw3675B-ms98-a-0015 51.011625 52.617625 yeah
sw3675B-ms98-a-0016 52.617625 55.514500 either savings or investment one of the two but
sw3675B-ms98-a-0017 55.514500 59.739125 we don't ever put it at a high risk it's just always gonna be there
sw3675B-ms98-a-0018 59.739125 62.256250 [silence]
sw3675B-ms98-a-0019 62.256250 69.511125 and as far as the rest of it's concerned we don't have any kind of uh what i would call extravagant expenses you know
sw3675B-ms98-a-0020 69.511125 75.566875 uh we uh we pretty much live on about eight nine hundred a month
sw3675B-ms98-a-0021 75.566875 79.203875 you know just travel to and from work and clothing and food
sw3675B-ms98-a-0022 79.203875 83.889250 and the rest of it you know we pile into the house
sw3675B-ms98-a-0023 83.889250 89.568500 and uh you know i'm fairly fortunate i mean our credit cards are out to the max right now because_1 i'm
sw3675B-ms98-a-0024 89.568500 95.247875 a little a little behind on that but uh we're still making the payments on them_1 it's just uh
sw3675B-ms98-a-0025 95.247875 99.843625 when you see in Texas you cannot borrow the money to build your own home
sw3675B-ms98-a-0026 99.843625 101.775000 and do it yourself
sw3675B-ms98-a-0027 101.775000 103.854000 [silence]
sw3675B-ms98-a-0028 103.854000 105.835875 right exactly

sw3675B-ms98-a-0031 112.603000 116.161250 and where i live i[t]- it's pretty scary
sw3675B-ms98-a-0032 116.161250 127.226125 because Texas is one of those strange states where if you have a contractor sign on your note like that and you screw up you don't get it finished the bank can eat the contractor
sw3675B-ms98-a-0033 127.226125 129.609250 yeah bad for him
sw3675B-ms98-a-0034 129.609250 133.433000 but the homeowner can't be touched
sw3675B-ms98-a-0035 133.433000 135.886625 it's a homestead state
sw3675B-ms98-a-0036 135.886625 142.848375 yeah see right now if i quit paying any of my bills the only thing they could do is cut off the electricity
sw3675B-ms98-a-0037 142.848375 146.031375 they can't take your land unless you don't pay your land taxes
sw3675B-ms98-a-0038 146.031375 147.875875 period
sw3675B-ms98-a-0039 147.875875 155.194875 you know they take your car and your clothes and your anything that's not the tools of your trade
sw3675B-ms98-a-0040 155.194875 156.292125 [silence]
sw3675B-ms98-a-0041 156.292125 158.632250 but as far as uh you know

sw3675B-ms98-a-0056 209.531875 217.894000 yeah yeah we're pretty pretty fortunate as far as the uh the budgeting is concerned because you know we don't have any long term debt
sw3675B-ms98-a-0057 217.894000 223.215500 you know uh we paid cash for car well we bought the car on time one of them_1
sw3675B-ms98-a-0058 223.215500 225.953500 but we you know we since paid it off and
sw3675B-ms98-a-0059 225.953500 229.396250 the land is paid for cash so we don't have to worry about that
sw3675B-ms98-a-0060 229.396250 230.552625 [silence]
sw3675B-ms98-a-0061 230.552625 233.250375 well it's fraught with other problems
sw3675B-ms98-a-0062 233.250375 234.583750 [laughter]
sw3675B-ms98-a-0063 234.583750 237.847500 yeah i'm not very motivated [laughter]
