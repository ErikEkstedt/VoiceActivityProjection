sw3617B-ms98-a-0013 94.444750 102.645250 yeah my husband uh ran for a while but it was just too hard on his knees he he just felt like it did his knees in
sw3617B-ms98-a-0014 102.645250 115.619250 so he went to um he walks and or does Stairmaster um you know depending on his schedule and the weather um but he felt like that was just too hard on his joints too so he he
sw3617B-ms98-a-0015 115.619250 125.593125 [silence]
sw3617B-ms98-a-0016 125.593125 128.346250 right right
sw3617B-ms98-a-0017 128.346250 142.583000 well we um the the place where i work out has just gotten all new equipment so i'm trying to get used to adjust adjusting to the new equipment but i do like it it it uh it seems to um
sw3617B-ms98-a-0018 142.583000 146.503000 do certain muscles much better i think it um
sw3617B-ms98-a-0019 146.503000 159.700250 you know works you out in a better place it doesn't uh bother your my back as much and but i it's hard it's like now you have to adjust to all this new stuff and it there's a lot of adjusting of each individual piece of equipment
sw3617B-ms98-a-0020 159.700250 169.850000 so i i'm in the process of trying to um [laughter] get adjusted to it but i think i'm going to like it um because it just isolates muscles so much better than the other
sw3617B-ms98-a-0021 169.850000 172.013250 [silence]
