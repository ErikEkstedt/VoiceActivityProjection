sw3617A-ms98-a-0005 49.283250 59.585250 yeah i i used to run i ran for about twenty years but it takes [noise] wear and tear on the joints so couple couple years ago i switched over to stationary bike and i
sw3617A-ms98-a-0006 59.585250 72.736375 i do about fifty miles a week on a a stationary bike for to keep my lower body developed and then i work out three times a week with uh weights at home to
sw3617A-ms98-a-0007 72.736375 77.723625 you know keep the upper part of shoulders and you know arms that sort of thing
sw3617A-ms98-a-0008 77.723625 81.607500 so that seems between the two of them it's seems to keep me i guess fairly fit

sw3617A-ms98-a-0012 114.653125 126.126875 uh the the running was just too hard on both my knees and my hips and the um stationary bike keeps you toned and is keeps the stress off of the joints
sw3617A-ms98-a-0013 126.126875 168.976875 [silence]
sw3617A-ms98-a-0014 168.976875 172.877750 well i guess they went out and bought all that equipment just to keep you on your toes huh
sw3617A-ms98-a-0015 172.877750 197.025750 [silence]
sw3617A-ms98-a-0016 197.025750 211.909750 well i i just do the self motivation i can do my fifty miles a week on the bike that's four times a week and then the three times the weights some days i do both and then some days it's one or the other just depending on how it goes i know 
sw3617A-ms98-a-0017 211.909750 227.234500 on the weights and the bicycle like you know even even yesterday on Christmas day i was on the i did the the weights for a while and the bicycle but today i just do the bicycle because i can do the bicycle a couple of days in a row but the weights you have to do those every other day so
sw3617A-ms98-a-0018 227.234500 230.252250 [silence]
sw3617A-ms98-a-0019 230.252250 239.929875 um usually when i'm bicycling i listen to the uh listen to the radio uh just turn on some music and listen to the radio when i bike and
sw3617A-ms98-a-0020 239.929875 243.609750 same thing while i'm using the weights and sometimes i'll
sw3617A-ms98-a-0021 243.609750 247.379750 watch the news or whatever most of the time i'll just listen to the radio though
sw3617A-ms98-a-0022 247.379750 251.373000 [silence]
sw3617A-ms98-a-0023 251.373000 255.968750 yeah um i do it in four thirty minute sessions
sw3617A-ms98-a-0024 255.968750 258.692625 so each each time i do it
sw3617A-ms98-a-0025 258.692625 264.466125 it it's roughly twelve and a half miles per session and then i do four of those and that sums up being fifty miles
sw3617A-ms98-a-0026 264.466125 267.530125 [silence]

sw3617A-ms98-a-0029 271.659750 286.141625 but it it works pretty good it measures you know it measures your your pulse and and and your miles per hour and calories expended and you know it has levels of difficulty from one through nine and so forth but i don't even remember the name of it any more 
sw3617A-ms98-a-0030 286.141625 298.530000 [silence]
