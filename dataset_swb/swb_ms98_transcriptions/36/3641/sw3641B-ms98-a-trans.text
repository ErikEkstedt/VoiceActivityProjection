sw3641B-ms98-a-0013 46.760875 47.854875 [silence]
sw3641B-ms98-a-0014 47.854875 50.747375 so you primarily rely on on the radio
sw3641B-ms98-a-0015 50.747375 51.730875 right
sw3641B-ms98-a-0016 51.730875 61.317875 [silence]
sw3641B-ms98-a-0017 61.317875 65.651500 do you have where these people call in express their opinions and talk back

sw3641B-ms98-a-0022 80.499625 81.764875 [silence]
sw3641B-ms98-a-0023 81.764875 84.025625 at the office
sw3641B-ms98-a-0024 84.025625 89.790375 nothing newsworthy uh uh National Geographic Reader's Digest
sw3641B-ms98-a-0025 89.790375 94.421500 uh i'm afraid we're probably reliant on newspapers and radio
sw3641B-ms98-a-0026 94.421500 98.332750 television news i'm not interested in their in them
sw3641B-ms98-a-0027 98.332750 101.825500 [silence]
sw3641B-ms98-a-0028 101.825500 108.381000 uh no i don't uh especially in depth things like 60 Minutes
sw3641B-ms98-a-0029 108.381000 112.957625 or or whatever else they call i think they're very biased 
sw3641B-ms98-a-0030 112.957625 114.947250 uh
sw3641B-ms98-a-0031 114.947250 116.485750 uh
sw3641B-ms98-a-0032 116.485750 122.022000 journalistic uh they'll go into some guy's office with TV cameras rolling and
sw3641B-ms98-a-0033 122.022000 126.625250 because he sticks up his hand doesn't want to be seen he's co[nsidered]- he's supposed to be considered guilty
sw3641B-ms98-a-0034 126.625250 131.917000 they're char[ging]- they're making a man look guilty before he's even given a chance to hear his side of the story but

sw3641B-ms98-a-0040 165.123750 171.308000 Gorbachev Gorbachev got into a political quarrel about three years ago and uh
sw3641B-ms98-a-0041 171.308000 175.026375 Gorbachev just got beat to the punch politically
sw3641B-ms98-a-0042 175.026375 181.468500 and i mean even with a guy Gorbachev goes to his office to clean out his desk for the next day and Yeltsin is already there sitting [laughter-there]

sw3641B-ms98-a-0055 239.428250 244.105250 we lost the second major newspaper in Dallas within this month
sw3641B-ms98-a-0056 244.105250 248.134125 the Dallas Times Herald went under we were one of the few
sw3641B-ms98-a-0057 248.134125 251.619250 few cities remaining big cities that had two papers
sw3641B-ms98-a-0058 251.619250 261.503750 and and we're sorry now you got the Fort Worth Press and uh uh no Fort Worth Star Telegram The Press went years ago and the Dallas Mourning News and
sw3641B-ms98-a-0059 261.503750 263.698875 [silence]
sw3641B-ms98-a-0060 263.698875 270.685000 yep yep competition killed them and and then well the Morning News finally bought out the the Herald
sw3641B-ms98-a-0061 270.685000 272.740125 of course closed it down [laughter]
sw3641B-ms98-a-0062 272.740125 274.080875 [laughter]

sw3641B-ms98-a-0065 276.323625 279.446375 oh i've been with the Dallas Morning News for twenty years
sw3641B-ms98-a-0066 279.446375 288.787000 it is the conservative paper and i'm probably lean to being conservative as opposed to liberal so and the other was kind of the liberal paper so
sw3641B-ms98-a-0067 288.787000 295.404125 so i feel sorry for all the liberals in town they have to read the good stuff now [laughter]
