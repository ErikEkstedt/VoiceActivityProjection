sw3651B-ms98-a-0003 3.112125 5.358375 what kind of woodworking do you do
sw3651B-ms98-a-0004 5.358375 13.026750 [silence]
sw3651B-ms98-a-0005 13.026750 14.677875 uh-huh 
sw3651B-ms98-a-0006 14.677875 33.318750 [silence]
sw3651B-ms98-a-0007 33.318750 42.297375 [noise] uh w[ell]- well i[t]- yeah i like to think of it as a hobby but i i guess also partly out of necessity just repairing things around the house
sw3651B-ms98-a-0008 42.297375 52.569750 um a few years ago uh w[e]- we needed uh they needed some book shelves and i kind of drew up some simple plans to make some book shelves and
sw3651B-ms98-a-0009 52.569750 61.606000 um uh i[t]- it actually worked pretty well and over the years i've i've refined those plans i got myself a router and i'm i'm very good at making book shelves
sw3651B-ms98-a-0010 61.606000 70.278750 it it's also a way of relieving stress my wife kind of laughs at me that anytime i get stressed i just go out in the garage and we've got more book shelves [noise] but
sw3651B-ms98-a-0011 70.278750 96.193375 [silence]
sw3651B-ms98-a-0012 96.193375 103.865375 uh [vocalized-noise] well yeah i mean little by little i i [laughter-started] out with just basic hand tools and kind of added on to things uh
sw3651B-ms98-a-0013 103.865375 112.246750 [vocalized-noise] gotten a a good belt sander and and the router uh helps a lot because you can make better joints with a router
sw3651B-ms98-a-0014 112.246750 117.734875 [noise] the latest project that i've been working on an[d]- and this has kind of been sitting here for a few months is a
sw3651B-ms98-a-0015 117.734875 120.865750 a cabinet to to put a TV in
sw3651B-ms98-a-0016 120.865750 122.153875 [silence]
sw3651B-ms98-a-0017 122.153875 129.254875 right and it that's works well because you can design it to to suit whatever {equipments} you have
sw3651B-ms98-a-0018 129.254875 138.372500 so i designed a space just the right size for the TV and then th[e]- the the VCR and shelves on the side for my stereo equipment and uh
sw3651B-ms98-a-0019 138.372500 140.203125 that's worked pretty well
sw3651B-ms98-a-0020 140.203125 147.726750 uh [vocalized-noise] with uh with the router you can make nice uh [noise] i guess dado joints is what it's called
sw3651B-ms98-a-0021 147.726750 151.738500 um and it's uh
sw3651B-ms98-a-0022 151.738500 157.564500 [silence]
sw3651B-ms98-a-0023 157.564500 160.072500 that's right that's right
sw3651B-ms98-a-0024 160.072500 161.622375 so
sw3651B-ms98-a-0025 161.622375 166.500875 [silence]
sw3651B-ms98-a-0026 166.500875 173.573875 what i- what i need next is a good table saw and i i debate whether it the better if you get a uh
sw3651B-ms98-a-0027 173.573875 181.007750 just a straight table saw or to get one of these uh rotary arm saws radial arm saws i guess what they're called
sw3651B-ms98-a-0028 181.007750 186.646500 um it it seems to me the radial arm saws is better
sw3651B-ms98-a-0029 186.646500 196.610125 well it it takes up less room i mean you you set the wood down and you move the saw whereas if you're ripping wood you're probably better off with a a table saw
sw3651B-ms98-a-0030 196.610125 210.817625 [silence]
sw3651B-ms98-a-0031 210.817625 216.598625 yeah uh that that's partly my problem now is i don't have room for this i uh
sw3651B-ms98-a-0032 216.598625 226.858125 a we're uh where we lived before up north uh basements were were common and i could've put all this stuff in my basement but not so here in Texas
sw3651B-ms98-a-0033 226.858125 237.557750 [silence]
sw3651B-ms98-a-0034 237.557750 238.991375 yeah [vocalized-noise]
