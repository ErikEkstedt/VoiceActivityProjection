sw3694A-ms98-a-0002 0.017625 7.362750 okay_1 [noise] i'm sorry speaking of air pollution i'm [vocalized-noise] coughing like a dog now um
sw3694A-ms98-a-0003 7.362750 10.751625 i'm not sure what contributes to air pollution exactly
sw3694A-ms98-a-0004 10.751625 15.565250 i find it hard to believe that a lot of the hair sprays and things that we use
sw3694A-ms98-a-0005 15.565250 19.275375 cause the air pollution and it just doesn't seem like
sw3694A-ms98-a-0006 19.275375 25.768625 but i guess when you think of it everybody has some sort of aerosol in their home you know and it it's kind of dangerous

sw3694A-ms98-a-0013 43.315125 48.544625 but you think the mountains and the are kind of a barrier hum that's a
sw3694A-ms98-a-0014 48.544625 50.939750 that's an interesting thought

sw3694A-ms98-a-0022 60.719750 63.395500 here in Texas i know a lot of the
sw3694A-ms98-a-0023 63.395500 76.273000 pretty much every place here is is relatively flat and so i would think that that would probably contribute to us not having that big of a like a smog problem or something like that i'm not sure
sw3694A-ms98-a-0024 76.273000 77.775375 [silence]

sw3694A-ms98-a-0029 95.114250 104.001250 i- i gue[ss]- yeah i guess i've never really uh thought about the fact that like in California they they have a lot of smog problems
sw3694A-ms98-a-0030 104.001250 114.076625 and it's real hilly there so that is probably something that plays a big factor [noise] i think probably jus[t]- uh a lot of factories
sw3694A-ms98-a-0031 114.076625 121.445250 um you know they have the smoke stacks i guess you call them_1 i don't know what you call them_1 and different things like that

sw3694A-ms98-a-0066 233.516375 235.172000 we just
sw3694A-ms98-a-0067 235.172000 244.588375 yeah we just had a big uh thing here in Waco they're needing to open a new landfill or to expand onto the old landfill
sw3694A-ms98-a-0068 244.588375 256.754750 and uh it it's really been a big fight because a lot of the people that live by the landfill don't want it expanded because they're thinking that their water is going to be contaminated somehow and so they

sw3694A-ms98-a-0078 279.692500 290.333875 and one one of the big concerns is they have a there's a school right across the highway from the landfill yeah so the parents were really really [laughter-upset]
sw3694A-ms98-a-0079 290.333875 298.722000 um-hum yeah and they've they've been fighting over it for the last year and they just now approved it so they were gonna try an appeal or something
