sw3618A-ms98-a-0018 68.655750 80.685125 well mother uh mother lived about fifty miles from me and a hundred miles and five hundred miles from the other sisters and so if sh[e]- if someone could've stayed close by she could've stayed in her home longer
sw3618A-ms98-a-0019 80.685125 86.927625 but as it was uh she had to come and start living with us and and she gets more dependent all the time

sw3618A-ms98-a-0028 115.189500 120.227125 um-hum and i would check on cleanliness and another thing i'd check on is the food
sw3618A-ms98-a-0029 120.227125 124.939250 my sister-in-law was in in one and uh she ju[st]- just had her hip replaced
sw3618A-ms98-a-0030 124.939250 128.900875 and so she just went to one you know for the li[ttle]- time for it to exercise and thing
sw3618A-ms98-a-0031 128.900875 139.492125 and they'd feed them_1 really weird things like [vocalized-noise] uh salad for breakfast and broccoli and she was she had her facilities about her and she didn't i mean she knew that they were doing it wrong
sw3618A-ms98-a-0032 139.492125 141.303625 so i think they're
sw3618A-ms98-a-0033 141.303625 144.973625 [silence]
sw3618A-ms98-a-0034 144.973625 146.914000 yes uh-huh
sw3618A-ms98-a-0035 146.914000 147.916750 [silence]
sw3618A-ms98-a-0036 147.916750 151.067875 yeah i think that's a problem too so
sw3618A-ms98-a-0037 151.067875 153.207250 [silence]
sw3618A-ms98-a-0038 153.207250 155.009250 i do too and i
sw3618A-ms98-a-0039 155.009250 159.041750 [silence]
sw3618A-ms98-a-0040 159.041750 160.632000 um-hum

sw3618A-ms98-a-0042 162.258375 167.924875 well the one that i that i we would put my mother in would be about three miles from my home
sw3618A-ms98-a-0043 167.924875 172.799375 and so i would check her t[o]- i mean she was in there when she had her her hip replaced too
sw3618A-ms98-a-0044 172.799375 176.014000 and so i would check on her two or three times a day
sw3618A-ms98-a-0045 176.014000 177.644625 they
sw3618A-ms98-a-0046 177.644625 185.929750 it is it is and you just you know well it comes right down to it i think it'd be heartbreaking how old was your grandmother when you put her in
sw3618A-ms98-a-0047 185.929750 187.593250 your great grandmother
sw3618A-ms98-a-0048 187.593250 189.621750 [silence]

sw3618A-ms98-a-0052 203.774000 205.102000 [noise]
sw3618A-ms98-a-0053 205.102000 205.825500 what
sw3618A-ms98-a-0054 205.825500 207.065625 [silence]
sw3618A-ms98-a-0055 207.065625 212.854750 oh it is and i[t]- and i[t]- you know it's a tough decision to take them into your home when you're used to your freedom
sw3618A-ms98-a-0056 212.854750 215.073000 [silence]
sw3618A-ms98-a-0057 215.073000 222.063500 yeah it is and and uh you know uh we[ll]- it's just like having a child again do you have children oh
sw3618A-ms98-a-0058 222.063500 225.449375 oh you're just a youngster then [laughter]
sw3618A-ms98-a-0059 225.449375 233.325750 oh oh well i don't think we've solved any great problems but i wish [vocalized-noise] what
sw3618A-ms98-a-0060 233.325750 237.652875 [silence]
sw3618A-ms98-a-0061 237.652875 239.339250 uh-huh
sw3618A-ms98-a-0062 239.339250 247.809875 [silence]
sw3618A-ms98-a-0063 247.809875 257.315250 right right and not and uh my mother's on insulin and i think you know just giving her the right amount checking her blood and giving her the right amount
sw3618A-ms98-a-0064 257.315250 261.208375 and then again back to the food i think that they have uh
sw3618A-ms98-a-0065 261.208375 268.475000 if they don't eat if they don't eat by themselves or if they don't want like what's that served that day they don't eat it and i think a lot of them_1 starve to death
sw3618A-ms98-a-0066 268.475000 270.656625 they just wither away and
sw3618A-ms98-a-0067 270.656625 278.007625 [silence]
sw3618A-ms98-a-0068 278.007625 286.884000 no no i don't i i just think the solution if every [vocalized-noise] but a lot of people can't either can't take care of them_1 at home
sw3618A-ms98-a-0069 286.884000 298.876125 you know if you're working and i- i think the ideal situation is like with your grandmother have someone come into their home and live with them and take care of them_1 and a lot of people like to do that
sw3618A-ms98-a-0070 298.876125 299.522000 [silence]
