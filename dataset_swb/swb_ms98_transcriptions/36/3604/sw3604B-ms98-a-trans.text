sw3604B-ms98-a-0005 9.026875 15.010375 [laughter] why couldn't we get something simple like movies or books something more uh more fun
sw3604B-ms98-a-0006 15.010375 17.070250 [silence]
sw3604B-ms98-a-0007 17.070250 20.979375 yeah well we will we'll just give lots to talk about won't we

sw3604B-ms98-a-0009 23.047250 24.878625 [silence]
sw3604B-ms98-a-0010 24.878625 29.745625 okay well uh i have a business of my own
sw3604B-ms98-a-0011 29.745625 37.780625 and i feel pretty strongly about it i don't mind being drug tested and i don't feel the employees should
sw3604B-ms98-a-0012 37.780625 39.954375 now you know
sw3604B-ms98-a-0013 39.954375 51.913125 [silence]
sw3604B-ms98-a-0014 51.913125 61.457125 no i- i- i you know i think sometimes that when you fly for example you know pilots and things like that or people um
sw3604B-ms98-a-0015 61.457125 68.750625 that are even [vocalized-noise] using uh automated equipment of some kind where another person could be injured you know
sw3604B-ms98-a-0016 68.750625 73.797625 you know and uh well a lot of times i think it depends upon
sw3604B-ms98-a-0017 73.797625 83.407875 the occasion but you know i've never had any problem with being drug tested and i wouldn't think that other people should have either i guess that's sort of a personal opinion
sw3604B-ms98-a-0018 83.407875 93.642625 [silence]
sw3604B-ms98-a-0019 93.642625 95.130750 um-hum
sw3604B-ms98-a-0020 95.130750 98.176250 [silence]
sw3604B-ms98-a-0021 98.176250 106.246625 well i have a private high school and uh we uh get permission from the parents before the children the students enroll
sw3604B-ms98-a-0022 106.246625 110.440125 to allow random drug testing because i've seen what can happen
sw3604B-ms98-a-0023 110.440125 116.734250 to youngsters who were not on drugs being around it and getting influenced by their peers who are
sw3604B-ms98-a-0024 116.734250 120.190000 and there's a lot of it in the public school system
sw3604B-ms98-a-0025 120.190000 121.461000 and
sw3604B-ms98-a-0026 121.461000 128.116250 [silence]
sw3604B-ms98-a-0027 128.116250 133.341125 yeah and of course good kids try to stay away from it but i've seen kids
sw3604B-ms98-a-0028 133.341125 140.362750 start out not being on drugs and end up being there because it was being sold right out un[der]- under their noses you know
sw3604B-ms98-a-0029 140.362750 146.866500 so uh you know i feel pretty strongly about it i you know i know that
sw3604B-ms98-a-0030 146.866500 151.395500 there are people that say we're violating the civil rights and what have you but they don't have to [laughter-enroll]
sw3604B-ms98-a-0031 151.395500 154.971375 you know they don't have to take that job if that's the way they feel about it
sw3604B-ms98-a-0032 154.971375 160.025625 [silence]
sw3604B-ms98-a-0033 160.025625 163.780875 yeah that's right they're violating ours you know
sw3604B-ms98-a-0034 163.780875 177.568750 [silence]
sw3604B-ms98-a-0035 177.568750 188.640250 well they can be more productive and more useful yeah i feel that way too we don't uh kick them out we ask that we call parents in if we haven't had one test positive yet but
sw3604B-ms98-a-0036 188.640250 195.357250 if it did we would call the parents in and uh you know get help for them before it's too late
sw3604B-ms98-a-0037 195.357250 202.453125 [silence]
sw3604B-ms98-a-0038 202.453125 204.541500 oh he just
sw3604B-ms98-a-0039 204.541500 208.452875 [silence]
sw3604B-ms98-a-0040 208.452875 216.717125 um-hum and uh you know it's just really a shame that he he couldn't get enough help to keep his career going
sw3604B-ms98-a-0041 216.717125 232.630375 [silence]
sw3604B-ms98-a-0042 232.630375 239.339250 yeah i think so and uh i think that youngsters who looked up to the Roy Tarpleys and
sw3604B-ms98-a-0043 239.339250 249.542375 uh the other people that have gotten into drugs i think they're going to be more conscious of the effect it can have and they get you know look at what he's thrown away
sw3604B-ms98-a-0044 249.542375 257.529750 you know a wonderful career a tremendous amount of money uh because he couldn't get enough help to over come it
sw3604B-ms98-a-0045 257.529750 260.837125 and probably wasn't started early enough either
sw3604B-ms98-a-0046 260.837125 267.981500 no but i think they can influence the youngsters in a good positive way when they're good role models
sw3604B-ms98-a-0047 267.981500 270.131500 [silence]
sw3604B-ms98-a-0048 270.131500 282.970875 now i think so too and like it's important you know i do[n't]- i have never been against being drug tested myself and so i feel that the owner of a company you know you set forth the policy and you follow through with it too
sw3604B-ms98-a-0049 282.970875 288.304750 you know and it doesn't exclude this one or that one it's everybody's it's a[ll]- it's all inclusive
sw3604B-ms98-a-0050 288.304750 294.093875 i know TI does that TI uh you know they never know who who's gonna be called
sw3604B-ms98-a-0051 294.093875 295.523375 you know
sw3604B-ms98-a-0052 295.523375 299.522000 um-hum it's just a random thing that they'll get a call in the m[orning]-
