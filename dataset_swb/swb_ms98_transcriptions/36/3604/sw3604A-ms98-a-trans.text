sw3604A-ms98-a-0011 24.288750 25.601250 okay
sw3604A-ms98-a-0012 25.601250 29.140375 [silence]
sw3604A-ms98-a-0013 29.140375 30.490000 uh-huh
sw3604A-ms98-a-0014 30.490000 37.665250 [silence]
sw3604A-ms98-a-0015 37.665250 44.308875 yeah i agree with that i think especially in some of the the jobs that the government has you just need people who are you know
sw3604A-ms98-a-0016 44.308875 49.221375 who are sober all the time to take care of them_1 you know you're paying them_1 to do a certain job and if they're
sw3604A-ms98-a-0017 49.221375 52.471500 they're on drugs and doing things they're not supposed to be doing
sw3604A-ms98-a-0018 52.471500 59.470375 [silence]
sw3604A-ms98-a-0019 59.470375 60.644500 uh-huh
sw3604A-ms98-a-0020 60.644500 68.047125 [silence]
sw3604A-ms98-a-0021 68.047125 69.639250 absolutely
sw3604A-ms98-a-0022 69.639250 82.908750 [silence]
sw3604A-ms98-a-0023 82.908750 91.314125 yeah well you know what i think part of the thing that you do when you apply for a job is you you know you tell them_1 that you're gonna do a certain type of work and be a certain type of person and
sw3604A-ms98-a-0024 91.314125 94.081000 you know i think part of that is living the law
sw3604A-ms98-a-0025 94.081000 98.452375 i know if i had my own company i'd want people who are honest in all they're dealings so
sw3604A-ms98-a-0026 98.452375 105.681250 [silence]
sw3604A-ms98-a-0027 105.681250 106.987500 uh-huh
sw3604A-ms98-a-0028 106.987500 116.098625 [silence]
sw3604A-ms98-a-0029 116.098625 117.403500 um-hum
sw3604A-ms98-a-0030 117.403500 119.511875 [silence]
sw3604A-ms98-a-0031 119.511875 123.749125 oh absolutely i was i went to school in Plano when i was growing up
sw3604A-ms98-a-0032 123.749125 129.043125 and just i don't know it was [laughter] i was surprised how much of it was there
sw3604A-ms98-a-0033 129.043125 139.643250 [silence]
sw3604A-ms98-a-0034 139.643250 140.732250 yep
sw3604A-ms98-a-0035 140.732250 151.158125 [silence]
sw3604A-ms98-a-0036 151.158125 152.381000 yeah
sw3604A-ms98-a-0037 152.381000 154.407375 [silence]
sw3604A-ms98-a-0038 154.407375 160.492375 yeah and i think the second part to that is you know they're also violating civil rights when they're using these dr[ugs]- illegal drugs
sw3604A-ms98-a-0039 160.492375 162.893500 [silence]
sw3604A-ms98-a-0040 162.893500 164.970000 yeah and i think you know
sw3604A-ms98-a-0041 164.970000 174.744375 personally i the way i feel about it is it's a lot better that we go ahead and and help these people you know that when we find that they're they're using drugs that we help them to get over that so they can be 
sw3604A-ms98-a-0042 174.744375 180.045125 good peo[ple]- or not not necessarily i'm not saying they're bad people but they they can be productive people
sw3604A-ms98-a-0043 180.045125 181.568875 right
sw3604A-ms98-a-0044 181.568875 193.494000 [silence]
sw3604A-ms98-a-0045 193.494000 194.728250 uh-huh
sw3604A-ms98-a-0046 194.728250 203.239250 absolutely you know i think i look at especially some of the professional athletes and i was a big Mavericks fan for a long time and i watched Roy Tarpley you know
sw3604A-ms98-a-0047 203.239250 209.412500 he could have lost his life if it wasn't for someone who cared enough to say let's give you a drug test and find out where you're at
sw3604A-ms98-a-0048 209.412500 216.095375 [silence]
sw3604A-ms98-a-0049 216.095375 221.752875 abso[lutely]- i think it's important that we remember that it's not the job that's important thing it's it's the individual
sw3604A-ms98-a-0050 221.752875 227.313875 kind of like what you were saying that it's just i don't know to me that's it's putting the focus back where it should be you know sure
sw3604A-ms98-a-0051 227.313875 233.005375 some people might not appreciate it but when it comes right down to it you're more worried about the individual and where their status is
sw3604A-ms98-a-0052 233.005375 248.877500 [silence]
sw3604A-ms98-a-0053 248.877500 249.944125 yeah
sw3604A-ms98-a-0054 249.944125 256.926875 [silence]

sw3604A-ms98-a-0058 261.276000 266.999750 [silence]
sw3604A-ms98-a-0059 266.999750 268.814250 oh absolutely
sw3604A-ms98-a-0060 268.814250 270.865250 and i think that's the key
sw3604A-ms98-a-0061 270.865250 282.505375 [silence]
sw3604A-ms98-a-0062 282.505375 283.560750 yeah
sw3604A-ms98-a-0063 283.560750 287.657375 [silence]
