sw3620A-ms98-a-0005 9.031125 17.149125 yeah well i don't know i really am not sure what they're spending on AID[S]- AIDS research i get the impression it's a pretty sizeable chunk of money
sw3620A-ms98-a-0006 17.149125 22.339500 i was always uh uh gosh i'm trying to remember where it was but recently
sw3620A-ms98-a-0007 22.339500 24.485500 uh somebody
sw3620A-ms98-a-0008 24.485500 29.610750 on the news said that one of the problems with uh AIDS research
sw3620A-ms98-a-0009 29.610750 38.080500 was that each time they find somebody with you know about every fourth or fifth person they've diagnosed with AIDS has got a new strain
sw3620A-ms98-a-0010 38.080500 43.158500 it seem to be mutating just like about_1 about like the common cold
sw3620A-ms98-a-0011 43.158500 47.938750 finding a cure for something like that could be
sw3620A-ms98-a-0012 47.938750 51.111250 several hundred years in the making
sw3620A-ms98-a-0013 51.111250 63.230250 [silence]
sw3620A-ms98-a-0014 63.230250 67.266125 well [noise] yeah the

sw3620A-ms98-a-0024 97.249250 99.169500 yeah that might help the
sw3620A-ms98-a-0025 99.169500 103.597500 it might help the awareness part but uh

sw3620A-ms98-a-0030 119.174000 121.743625 i don't know it you know
sw3620A-ms98-a-0031 121.743625 133.414125 the uh funding situation seems to be the same f[or]- for so many of the major diseases so to speak the uh bulk of the money goes to administrative costs
sw3620A-ms98-a-0032 133.414125 144.472125 which usually means high salaries for people running the show and a major name researcher's involved with it you know who knows what actually gets done as far as true research
sw3620A-ms98-a-0033 144.472125 146.432875 seems
sw3620A-ms98-a-0034 146.432875 154.495250 [silence]
sw3620A-ms98-a-0035 154.495250 166.559375 yeah it seems everywhere you turn somebody's coming up with it wild part about it nobody seems to want to suggest the idea that doing without is the only safe way of keeping from getting it
sw3620A-ms98-a-0036 166.559375 172.349000 they figured well you know we all want to be promiscuous so go running all over the place and

sw3620A-ms98-a-0038 177.374500 179.035000 yeah
sw3620A-ms98-a-0039 179.035000 186.982750 no there're there are people who don't get it from promiscuity but there's the sorts who get it through blood transfusions
sw3620A-ms98-a-0040 186.982750 190.431125 yeah that's the saddest cases of all of
sw3620A-ms98-a-0041 190.431125 196.676625 or that woman who died just rec[ently]- the one who died just recently got it uh from her dentist
sw3620A-ms98-a-0042 196.676625 204.950000 something like twenty two twenty three years old died of AIDS she got it because her dentist had it and didn't use any precautions
sw3620A-ms98-a-0043 204.950000 208.187500 i don't know but those are the sad cases

sw3620A-ms98-a-0049 243.866750 252.541875 um right now as far as the state budget concerning AIDS awareness i'm not even sure that there is i know there isn't any on the city level
sw3620A-ms98-a-0050 252.541875 263.039750 or on the county level i'm not sure if the state's got much of anything on the AIDS awareness i think most of the AIDS awareness information is more or less coming through private sector
sw3620A-ms98-a-0051 263.039750 266.004875 um the uh
sw3620A-ms98-a-0052 266.004875 267.617000 either that or

sw3620A-ms98-a-0056 280.483000 289.067750 course then again most of the people who are protesting the cut in the budget would probably be just as upset if they raised the tax city taxes to cover the costs
