sw3611A-ms98-a-0020 74.765750 79.417750 yeah i think we're kind of my family's in the same situation my my grandmother
sw3611A-ms98-a-0021 79.417750 90.456375 is about ninety two right now and just really has lost her senses she's gone senile and we basically take care of her between my uncle and aunt and ourselves and my uncle lives in in Utah so
sw3611A-ms98-a-0022 90.456375 96.023125 it's really it's a challenge for our family because my parents still have a lot of young kids and it's really tough for them to
sw3611A-ms98-a-0023 96.023125 98.483375 to handle my grandma as well as
sw3611A-ms98-a-0024 98.483375 102.340750 as well as um the rest of the family
sw3611A-ms98-a-0025 102.340750 110.889875 no not at all we're we basically push her around and she's lost control of her bowel and it's just it's really sad and it's kind of like you said that
sw3611A-ms98-a-0026 110.889875 122.670500 we've we've looked at some nursing homes and and just the situations that i've seen is most of the time when there are when they they go into the nursing homes they just lose even more than what they had before
sw3611A-ms98-a-0027 122.670500 124.462375 [silence]
sw3611A-ms98-a-0028 124.462375 125.910500 [vocalized-noise]

sw3611A-ms98-a-0030 127.946375 129.223875 uh-huh
sw3611A-ms98-a-0031 129.223875 134.958125 yeah and really you know they say that they're going to help them be productive but basically what they all do is they lay on their beds all day
sw3611A-ms98-a-0032 134.958125 137.704250 and it just to me that seems really sad
sw3611A-ms98-a-0033 137.704250 140.627000 [silence]
sw3611A-ms98-a-0034 140.627000 142.018500 uh-huh

sw3611A-ms98-a-0036 153.204625 155.908750 yeah it's kind of a challenge i guess
sw3611A-ms98-a-0037 155.908750 158.648125 [silence]
sw3611A-ms98-a-0038 158.648125 160.298125 [laughter]
sw3611A-ms98-a-0039 160.298125 161.519125 [silence]
sw3611A-ms98-a-0040 161.519125 174.913500 yeah i think you know i think they big thing is just to find a nursing home that really cares for other people and it's not just the money they're bringing in but it's it's more of a humanitarian thing where they want to help these people have the best years of their lives that are left
sw3611A-ms98-a-0041 174.913500 178.506125 and i think that's the real problem personally
sw3611A-ms98-a-0042 178.506125 182.333125 [silence]
sw3611A-ms98-a-0043 182.333125 183.626375 yeah

sw3611A-ms98-a-0045 184.964750 196.822000 yeah and see that's i couldn't do it i think that that'd be super tough just because_1 the people that you learn to love you see dying off one by one and i think that would just be really i admire those who can i couldn't handle that personally
sw3611A-ms98-a-0046 196.822000 201.688875 [silence]
sw3611A-ms98-a-0047 201.688875 202.959500 uh-huh

sw3611A-ms98-a-0051 212.028125 213.755750 yeah i think you're right
sw3611A-ms98-a-0052 213.755750 220.339875 and i think as you learn to know the volunteers and help them know a little bit about your family i guess that would make a difference too [noise]
sw3611A-ms98-a-0053 220.339875 230.184625 [silence]
sw3611A-ms98-a-0054 230.184625 235.671875 i i really don't to be honest with you i'm just seen i've done some work in [nursings/nursing] homes and i've kind of
sw3611A-ms98-a-0055 235.671875 240.259625 but in terms of specific qualifications i don't know other than three square meals a day
sw3611A-ms98-a-0056 240.259625 244.178500 uh fruit and supposed sanitation type things but
sw3611A-ms98-a-0057 244.178500 252.329750 i just it seems like every time i've sung a lot and so e[very]- almost every Christmas and every holiday you can think of we've gone in and sang at nursing homes and
sw3611A-ms98-a-0058 252.329750 258.364625 it's sad because really they're not an[d]- to me at least it doesn't seem like they're very well taken care of and any of them_1 that
sw3611A-ms98-a-0059 258.364625 259.954000 but
sw3611A-ms98-a-0060 259.954000 266.134875 [silence]
sw3611A-ms98-a-0061 266.134875 274.959875 yeah i tend to agree with that and i think more than anything for them that's important that if you're going to find a find some place where the people who are around them_1 really and truly love them_1
sw3611A-ms98-a-0062 274.959875 280.100375 and they know that they're still wanted and they're still they can still be a productive part of society
sw3611A-ms98-a-0063 280.100375 290.166625 and i think too often the nursing home for example my grandma's case she doesn't want to go to a nursing home because to her that's just a sign of losing everything and com[pletely]- being completely unproductive forever
sw3611A-ms98-a-0064 290.166625 293.678500 [silence]
sw3611A-ms98-a-0065 293.678500 294.988875 uh-huh
