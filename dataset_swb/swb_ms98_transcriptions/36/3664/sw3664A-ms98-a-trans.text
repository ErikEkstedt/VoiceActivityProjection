sw3664A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 3.739625 [noise] what do you how what do you think of your news coverage and where do you get most of it 
sw3664A-ms98-a-0002 3.739625 6.431375 [silence]
sw3664A-ms98-a-0003 6.431375 8.643375 oh oh

sw3664A-ms98-a-0008 23.836625 33.003250 yes we don't go to bed at night [vocalized-noise] usually until we've seen the news at ten so that's probably well we do take a daily paper too
sw3664A-ms98-a-0009 33.003250 43.561000 um-hum but it's out of Ogden and so it it's not very you know it's not probably as big as yours and sometimes i wonder about the newspaper coverages too anyway
sw3664A-ms98-a-0010 43.561000 51.457125 because_1 i've known stories that have happened and then read it in the paper and it hasn't been all that accurate um-hum um-hum
sw3664A-ms98-a-0011 51.457125 56.169875 [silence]
sw3664A-ms98-a-0012 56.169875 66.501750 that's true although i think that's the same on TV too you know you'll get one you know one day and one the next day on the same thing and so but i
sw3664A-ms98-a-0013 66.501750 73.672000 [vocalized-noise] i enjoy i enjoy the news i like to keep up on whatever's happening
sw3664A-ms98-a-0014 73.672000 75.311750 so
sw3664A-ms98-a-0015 75.311750 79.391250 [silence]

sw3664A-ms98-a-0020 96.064750 103.945250 [noise] yeah well i think sometimes you know you'll hear it on TV and you want want to go into it deeper you uh you can get it in a ma[gazine]- or a paper
sw3664A-ms98-a-0021 103.945250 110.508875 a newspaper and then on the radio you know they usually uh give the news every hour
sw3664A-ms98-a-0022 110.508875 114.810875 and so i i like that too especially when we're traveling
sw3664A-ms98-a-0023 114.810875 116.335250 so
sw3664A-ms98-a-0024 116.335250 121.562125 [silence]
sw3664A-ms98-a-0025 121.562125 126.769000 [laughter] [laughter-well] that's true too
sw3664A-ms98-a-0026 126.769000 138.558375 yeah uh-huh but you know if there's a story that you're particularly interested in it's good to [vocalized-noise] to be able to follow up on it [noise] you know so [noise]
sw3664A-ms98-a-0027 138.558375 151.815000 [noise] but uh [vocalized-noise] we have a a news station too that is [vocalized-noise] uh KSL out of Salt Lake that covers just it's a talk show and there's news almost constantly on it
sw3664A-ms98-a-0028 151.815000 155.305875 and then CNN has news constantly too
sw3664A-ms98-a-0029 155.305875 157.770000 so do you have cable
sw3664A-ms98-a-0030 157.770000 159.993250 oh
sw3664A-ms98-a-0031 159.993250 166.785250 oh [laughter] well we couldn't get TV here if we didn't have cable we live close to the mountain
sw3664A-ms98-a-0032 166.785250 171.761875 and uh the s[ignal]- the signal doesn't come because we're kind of behind a mountain
sw3664A-ms98-a-0033 171.761875 180.922000 so we couldn't get it if we didn't have ca[ble]- cable in fact we've when we first moved out here for the first probably twenty years we couldn't it was really snowy
sw3664A-ms98-a-0034 180.922000 186.821750 our reception and you know we'd watch it and the kids would watch it but it wasn't all that good
sw3664A-ms98-a-0035 186.821750 188.603500 so
sw3664A-ms98-a-0036 188.603500 189.636125 [silence]
sw3664A-ms98-a-0037 189.636125 196.917750 yeah well [laughter] we were glad when it came but it just keeps going up in price too so that's kind of detriment too
sw3664A-ms98-a-0038 196.917750 197.945000 [silence]
sw3664A-ms98-a-0039 197.945000 205.740250 but we've thought of getting a satellite so that we could get more stations but uh it wouldn't i don't know
sw3664A-ms98-a-0040 205.740250 214.355375 yeah but i don't think we're gonna to do it because it's uh you can't get local stations and that's the news that we're mostly interested in
sw3664A-ms98-a-0041 214.355375 226.001625 and back to news flash from our high school today we have one high school in town and they had to evacuate it because the furnace was acting up and was threatening to blow up [laughter]

sw3664A-ms98-a-0054 278.147875 289.544625 so it's uh but we i enjoy it i'd hate to be without a newspaper and then we get the local you know the little Brigham City one it's uh comes once a week
