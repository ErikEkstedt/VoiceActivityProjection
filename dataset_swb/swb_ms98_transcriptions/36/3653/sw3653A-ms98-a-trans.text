sw3653A-ms98-a-0027 87.314375 93.219625 to commute back and forth to work and it has been it almost has two hundred thousand miles [laughter]

sw3653A-ms98-a-0044 148.627000 160.818750 so that's i was kind of i my preference would to be just to go to a bigger car i think rather than rather than a van but you know even that is it's hard to find a car that is big enough i guess
sw3653A-ms98-a-0045 160.818750 169.656500 the problem we have now is our car it doesn't have a bench seat up front so if we had the bench seat then we would be fine but when we bought it we 
sw3653A-ms98-a-0046 169.656500 173.412500 we didn't get the bench seat up front so

sw3653A-ms98-a-0059 202.688000 212.296625 that's true i haven't i haven't thought about that because is there a lot more room in the regular size vans than in a car
