sw3439A-ms98-a-0039 125.977125 128.833125 a couple about about two minu[tes]- three minutes i think
sw3439A-ms98-a-0040 128.833125 139.415875 but i really don't have too much more to say in regards to credit cards i one thing i've always tried to do is when i get my credit cards i always try to pay them_1 off because_1 i just sort of detest paying interest
sw3439A-ms98-a-0041 139.415875 143.589250 and uh like years ago my wife and i got married
sw3439A-ms98-a-0042 143.589250 144.593250 [silence]
sw3439A-ms98-a-0043 144.593250 151.862625 she was the one with a little better heel than i was because i had my credit cards i think up to the limit and i was giving [laughter-everyone] ten dollars a month and everything like that but
sw3439A-ms98-a-0044 151.862625 153.070000 [silence]
sw3439A-ms98-a-0045 153.070000 158.514500 that was like thirty years ago so now it's a little different [laughter-we] i get a bill and i pay it the same day it comes in
sw3439A-ms98-a-0046 158.514500 162.849500 or at least i try to and i just try to tell my kids how much
sw3439A-ms98-a-0047 162.849500 166.026500 i hate paying interest so they should follow the same rule
sw3439A-ms98-a-0048 166.026500 169.552000 [silence]
