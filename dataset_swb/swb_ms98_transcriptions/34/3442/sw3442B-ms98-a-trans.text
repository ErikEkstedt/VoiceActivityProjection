sw3442B-ms98-a-0013 52.149125 57.157375 Catholic i do a lot of Catholic saints uh i do a lot of mystic um the
sw3442B-ms98-a-0014 57.157375 67.825750 the ancient um writings and i've been doing a lot of that kind of reading and um so like Saint Francis of Assisi and Teresa Viola um
sw3442B-ms98-a-0015 67.825750 76.750250 Teresa Saint John of the cross um those kinds of of writings uh s[ort]- sort of um old spiritual leaders um
sw3442B-ms98-a-0016 76.750250 79.663125 it's been real fascinating and
sw3442B-ms98-a-0017 79.663125 85.795250 that that's been a lot of my reading for the past number of years and then i read contemporary people um
sw3442B-ms98-a-0018 85.795250 92.534375 who um combine religion and psychology and that's been an interest of mine and so
sw3442B-ms98-a-0019 92.534375 106.720625 right now i'm currently reading a man named Morton Kelsey and uh his his a book on it called Transcend and it's a stor[y]- it's about prayer and um and it sort of combines uh some of the old um with the new
sw3442B-ms98-a-0020 106.720625 108.183875 so uh i
sw3442B-ms98-a-0021 108.183875 114.729875 yeah i do that kind of reading although i do do some uh casual reading my reading lately has been fairly heavy but um
sw3442B-ms98-a-0022 114.729875 120.730125 [laughter-it] [laughter-is] [laughter] but i just read i've read Prince of Tides have you you know that's going to be a new movie and 
sw3442B-ms98-a-0023 120.730125 123.412750 that's a good book if you yeah very good book
sw3442B-ms98-a-0024 123.412750 133.064375 i would highly recommend it um it's not a mystery uh i[t]- it is of sorts and it's it's really i[t's]- it's fiction but it's an excellent book i
sw3442B-ms98-a-0025 133.064375 155.150000 [silence]
sw3442B-ms98-a-0026 155.150000 159.761500 it depends i think i['ve]- i've learned through the years
sw3442B-ms98-a-0027 159.761500 171.000125 different books speak to different people and i s[ay]- you know my recommendation is for people to try it and if if they can understand it they're supposed to read it and if they can't you know then don't try
sw3442B-ms98-a-0028 171.000125 183.084500 um-hum because i really do think it depends on on where people are at the particular time as to whether or not they can read it and for me on certain books speak to me and certain books do not so you know i- i i[t]-
sw3442B-ms98-a-0029 183.084500 189.173625 and i just think not every book is for every person these are not like [laughter-you] [laughter-know] best sellers so um
