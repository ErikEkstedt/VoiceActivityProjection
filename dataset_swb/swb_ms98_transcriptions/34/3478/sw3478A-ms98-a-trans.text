sw3478A-ms98-a-0005 8.443000 15.083750 [silence]
sw3478A-ms98-a-0006 15.083750 16.963500 was that here in Texas
sw3478A-ms98-a-0007 16.963500 18.419500 [silence]
sw3478A-ms98-a-0008 18.419500 19.383875 uh-huh
sw3478A-ms98-a-0009 19.383875 26.792125 [silence]
sw3478A-ms98-a-0010 26.792125 28.375625 right right
sw3478A-ms98-a-0011 28.375625 31.294625 did did you have to put her in yourself or
sw3478A-ms98-a-0012 31.294625 32.541750 uh-huh
sw3478A-ms98-a-0013 32.541750 43.570875 [silence]
sw3478A-ms98-a-0014 43.570875 45.910250 understand understand that
sw3478A-ms98-a-0015 45.910250 47.163500 [silence]
sw3478A-ms98-a-0016 47.163500 50.961750 well my uh aunt that i kind of grew up with uh
sw3478A-ms98-a-0017 50.961750 61.356375 was in a nursing home she did have Alzheimer's and we had to put her in the nursing home because of that but uh this was up in uh Milwaukee Wisconsin and uh
sw3478A-ms98-a-0018 61.356375 68.621375 it was a situation that's probably as good as you're gonna get uh it's associated with uh our church and uh
sw3478A-ms98-a-0019 68.621375 78.606750 what they do my mother is in is a terrace which it's called Luther Manor Terrace and uh these are condominiums you buy into [noise]
sw3478A-ms98-a-0020 78.606750 83.759500 when you know whenever you know you're sixty or whatever you know whenever you want to buy into this thing and these are
sw3478A-ms98-a-0021 83.759500 92.539500 very nice condominium things and uh the idea is once you are in this program you are taken care of the rest of your life and they
sw3478A-ms98-a-0022 92.539500 95.857000 they have a nursing home if you can't
sw3478A-ms98-a-0023 95.857000 108.528750 maintain your own apartment or your condominium uh you automatically go into that and from there they also have a health care area if you can't you know if you need more intensive care
sw3478A-ms98-a-0024 108.528750 110.320750 and uh
sw3478A-ms98-a-0025 110.320750 111.338125 [silence]
sw3478A-ms98-a-0026 111.338125 117.611750 even the best there is isn't a nice situation with uh like you say when you get to a point where
sw3478A-ms98-a-0027 117.611750 125.602500 uh well she was ninety four and she was uh in the nursing home and the health care facility for i would guess about a year's time
sw3478A-ms98-a-0028 125.602500 127.218000 but uh
sw3478A-ms98-a-0029 127.218000 130.407000 it's a hard decision to make i tell you what it's uh
sw3478A-ms98-a-0030 130.407000 134.486250 [silence]
sw3478A-ms98-a-0031 134.486250 145.381625 that's that was really the p[rice]- and that it gets very hard and on anybody uh i'd go up there and visit and and she'd recognize me but as soon as i was out down the hall she didn't even know i was there
sw3478A-ms98-a-0032 145.381625 148.197500 and uh it's it's sad you know it
sw3478A-ms98-a-0033 148.197500 162.163500 [silence]
sw3478A-ms98-a-0034 162.163500 163.277125 yeah
sw3478A-ms98-a-0035 163.277125 179.393750 [silence]
sw3478A-ms98-a-0036 179.393750 188.366500 well i[t's]- it's but what's really hard is the differences of care you know if you aren't fortunate enough to have a situation like with my mother
sw3478A-ms98-a-0037 188.366500 197.020250 right now she's got terrible arthritis in her knees and it's probably not real long where she won't be able to you know get along on her own and she probably
sw3478A-ms98-a-0038 197.020250 209.006125 you know hopefully it will be a number of years but she's seventy nine years old right now and now she understands that someday you know if she can't handle her apartment that uh you know she'll have to go in the nursing home
sw3478A-ms98-a-0039 209.006125 213.685875 but if you have situations where you don't have that kind
sw3478A-ms98-a-0040 213.685875 224.838250 you know it's you're confronted with it and if you look at all the different nursing homes uh that are out there it it is kind of frightening some of these places uh it's like put them in a cubbyhole and you know they don't
sw3478A-ms98-a-0041 224.838250 235.640625 they're they're more caretakers kind of it's almost like putting a dog in a kennel you know some of these places and they stink and they're it it's a tough decision and you know if people don't have the resources for uh
sw3478A-ms98-a-0042 235.640625 243.463500 it's i- i don't know about in Arizona but around here i understand it's it's anywhere from about twenty three hundred to three thousand dollars a month in a a nursing home
sw3478A-ms98-a-0043 243.463500 260.771750 [silence]
sw3478A-ms98-a-0044 260.771750 261.872750 right
sw3478A-ms98-a-0045 261.872750 279.393750 [silence]
sw3478A-ms98-a-0046 279.393750 280.358000 yeah
sw3478A-ms98-a-0047 280.358000 284.044125 [silence]
sw3478A-ms98-a-0048 284.044125 290.434250 well and that's the other thing that helps is that you have a relative a close relative that'll look in on them
sw3478A-ms98-a-0049 290.434250 292.675000 even the best ones if you don't
sw3478A-ms98-a-0050 292.675000 298.562000 look in on them_1 they have a tendency to just sedate people so they don't have to bothered you know and
