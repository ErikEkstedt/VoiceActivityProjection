sw3478B-ms98-a-0042 257.862750 266.376000 her care wasn't completely hospital yet but uh and then she went into the hospital part so it was one of those progressive care
sw3478B-ms98-a-0043 266.376000 280.202125 uh kinds of situations and it was also affiliated with our church so it was a really nice facility but it would be terrible if you had no funds and and had to put someone in a nursing home and not know what kind of care they were really getting
