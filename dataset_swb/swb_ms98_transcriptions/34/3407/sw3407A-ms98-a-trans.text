sw3407A-ms98-a-0013 53.909875 65.239875 [noise] that you know uh maybe they use them_1 for legitimate purposes but they're all you know folks are getting them_1 and using them for [laughter-not] so legitimate to say the least

sw3407A-ms98-a-0022 118.436250 125.491375 yeah it's probably not someone that's running down to the store and buying one either is it probably someone who's got one already yeah
sw3407A-ms98-a-0023 125.491375 165.012125 [silence]
sw3407A-ms98-a-0024 165.012125 166.500000 uh-huh

sw3407A-ms98-a-0028 173.740625 184.122125 yeah i mean yeah i don't know if i mean yeah if someone wants to do someone in they're gonna do it whether they have a gun or not uh what do you think about that um that uh
sw3407A-ms98-a-0029 184.122125 190.312625 deal with the police officer evi[dently]- evidently um i guess they speculate that it was teenagers
sw3407A-ms98-a-0030 190.312625 193.298750 that that somehow got a hold of a gun
sw3407A-ms98-a-0031 193.298750 209.535625 [silence]
sw3407A-ms98-a-0032 209.535625 215.934875 yeah i i we just moved here about eight or nine months ago from from uh a little town in North Carolina
sw3407A-ms98-a-0033 215.934875 228.511125 and uh we have lived in Fort Worth before and and in Houston for a while so we we're you know we're accustomed to the big city but my kids weren't in in the age they are now they're in uh high school and ju[nior]- middle school
sw3407A-ms98-a-0034 228.511125 239.935500 and the mi[ddle]- the high schools around here um man police have come in and and uh you know they got [laughter-they] raid the school and take out ten revolvers you [laughter-know] [laughter-i] [laughter-mean] it's just uh
sw3407A-ms98-a-0035 239.935500 242.091625 so it seems like
sw3407A-ms98-a-0036 242.091625 254.472375 um you know it seems like and no and that's not a case of someone flipping out and running down and buying one so a waiting period isn't gonna help that but it seems like that there ought to be something that could be done [noise] to
sw3407A-ms98-a-0037 254.472375 258.960125 at least make it harder for those kids to get their hands on guns
