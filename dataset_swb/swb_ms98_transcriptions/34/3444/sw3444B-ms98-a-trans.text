sw3444B-ms98-a-0002 1.049125 9.296750 [silence]
sw3444B-ms98-a-0003 9.296750 14.621125 [noise] well i think that it can be um a hassle but
sw3444B-ms98-a-0004 14.621125 29.375125 considering some of the things we picked up um i think it's i think it means as much to get a clean one i think being able to prove that you're clean is is quite beneficial to the employee
sw3444B-ms98-a-0005 29.375125 35.049750 [noise] especially when there's been in an accident of some kind or you know something didn't go right
sw3444B-ms98-a-0006 35.049750 43.728250 i know our company requires it before uh employment and then if there's an accident on the job they require it
sw3444B-ms98-a-0007 43.728250 47.722125 and i does your company do the same
sw3444B-ms98-a-0008 47.722125 50.088250 on a accident
sw3444B-ms98-a-0009 50.088250 54.852750 [silence]

sw3444B-ms98-a-0013 58.644125 62.827250 [silence]
sw3444B-ms98-a-0014 62.827250 68.117500 well we hope they are at ours too but that's just in our policy and procedures
sw3444B-ms98-a-0015 68.117500 74.333500 but um we um i think in a in a way it's a protection for the employee
sw3444B-ms98-a-0016 74.333500 82.041500 because they can say that uh it definitely wasn't their fault [laughter] if they work on it you know hurt on the job
sw3444B-ms98-a-0017 82.041500 83.853750 [noise] [vocalized-noise]

sw3444B-ms98-a-0022 101.107125 105.297250 oh well i think uh
sw3444B-ms98-a-0023 105.297250 113.076000 the sensitiveness of either one of other professions requires complete ability to think properly
sw3444B-ms98-a-0024 113.076000 124.885250 [noise] and i think from that viewpoint it's not a bad idea but uh i'm not sure that the random testing i'm not so sure
sw3444B-ms98-a-0025 124.885250 136.636750 but i think if um [noise] if there's any suspicion that a person is using drugs i think that the employer should be able to do a little bit of testing
sw3444B-ms98-a-0026 136.636750 140.103250 oh yeah yeah [noise] for cause
sw3444B-ms98-a-0027 140.103250 151.903000 [silence]

sw3444B-ms98-a-0031 166.227000 171.644500 and um with even with the money we charge for it it uh
sw3444B-ms98-a-0032 171.644500 174.602875 it [laughter-uh] it's not a money maker [laughter]
sw3444B-ms98-a-0033 174.602875 181.430500 not at all but we we do have in our particular facility we have a special area
sw3444B-ms98-a-0034 181.430500 191.320750 where uh we do special toxicology work and uh the security involved is tremendous [noise] so it's uh
sw3444B-ms98-a-0035 191.320750 202.273250 one of those things that i know at least in our area is it provides properly which should be you know kind of comforting to people who have to have it done [laughter]
sw3444B-ms98-a-0036 202.273250 205.000375 [silence]
