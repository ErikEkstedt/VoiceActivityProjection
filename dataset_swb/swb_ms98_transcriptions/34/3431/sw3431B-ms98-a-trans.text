sw3431B-ms98-a-0006 22.895625 24.783500 [silence]
sw3431B-ms98-a-0007 24.783500 27.153750 which required quite a bit of painting
sw3431B-ms98-a-0008 27.153750 29.439000 [silence]
sw3431B-ms98-a-0009 29.439000 32.416250 no we did it ourselves did it myself

sw3431B-ms98-a-0014 57.906000 61.784875 what what what brought about the fading of the paint
sw3431B-ms98-a-0015 61.784875 64.097000 just sun exposure
sw3431B-ms98-a-0016 64.097000 70.844125 [silence]
sw3431B-ms98-a-0017 70.844125 72.734625 oh okay yeah

sw3431B-ms98-a-0023 94.608625 96.784750 on the ceiling
sw3431B-ms98-a-0024 96.784750 98.589250 yeah
sw3431B-ms98-a-0025 98.589250 101.080000 [silence]
sw3431B-ms98-a-0026 101.080000 102.807125 no that's true
sw3431B-ms98-a-0027 102.807125 104.765625 [silence]
sw3431B-ms98-a-0028 104.765625 107.909875 did you go what what kind of paint do you use on the ceiling
sw3431B-ms98-a-0029 107.909875 110.297375 [silence]
sw3431B-ms98-a-0030 110.297375 111.670500 okay

sw3431B-ms98-a-0034 120.883500 127.318750 seems like um i've we've done some remodeling of some uh rental houses that we have
sw3431B-ms98-a-0035 127.318750 133.612875 and it appears as though that uh oh in the fifties or sixties when some of these houses were built
sw3431B-ms98-a-0036 133.612875 139.821500 uh they used a lot of uh semigloss type enamel for ceiling paints
sw3431B-ms98-a-0037 139.821500 145.379625 and that was a little difficult to cover with today's paints it seemed like
sw3431B-ms98-a-0038 145.379625 149.964250 we had a occasion uh where we had to do some sealing
sw3431B-ms98-a-0039 149.964250 152.154500 of uh
sw3431B-ms98-a-0040 152.154500 156.487875 the cei[ling]- of the this type of paint before we could paint it
sw3431B-ms98-a-0041 156.487875 157.895000 yeah
sw3431B-ms98-a-0042 157.895000 159.348500 right
sw3431B-ms98-a-0043 159.348500 164.309250 you had pretty good luck with one coat type paints you use a particular brand or anything
sw3431B-ms98-a-0044 164.309250 168.868250 [silence]
sw3431B-ms98-a-0045 168.868250 171.802875 weather beater type stuff yeah
sw3431B-ms98-a-0046 171.802875 178.093125 [silence]
sw3431B-ms98-a-0047 178.093125 179.759125 understand
sw3431B-ms98-a-0048 179.759125 192.847625 [silence]
sw3431B-ms98-a-0049 192.847625 194.170750 um-hum
sw3431B-ms98-a-0050 194.170750 206.123375 [silence]
sw3431B-ms98-a-0051 206.123375 208.965875 yeah it's a lot like uh wall paper
sw3431B-ms98-a-0052 208.965875 210.587625 that's true
sw3431B-ms98-a-0053 210.587625 212.295875 [silence]
sw3431B-ms98-a-0054 212.295875 217.191875 well the particular bathroom that we did is a half bath so we didn't have a problem with that
sw3431B-ms98-a-0055 217.191875 218.652750 um
sw3431B-ms98-a-0056 218.652750 219.711500 [silence]
sw3431B-ms98-a-0057 219.711500 225.403375 i have had i've uh have never experienced that type of a problem
sw3431B-ms98-a-0058 225.403375 228.989625 uh with a latex paint
sw3431B-ms98-a-0059 228.989625 233.084375 so you shouldn't have a you shouldn't have a problem with it
sw3431B-ms98-a-0060 233.084375 238.675125 they're they're pretty well refined today a lot of the paints [vocalized-noise] and Sears is one of the better ones
sw3431B-ms98-a-0061 238.675125 242.856875 i've used uh many a gallon of them_1 myself
sw3431B-ms98-a-0062 242.856875 245.314500 [silence]
sw3431B-ms98-a-0063 245.314500 248.888125 uh used oil base paints for trim
sw3431B-ms98-a-0064 248.888125 253.400250 you know like around doors and and on doors things like that
sw3431B-ms98-a-0065 253.400250 255.757750 [silence]
sw3431B-ms98-a-0066 255.757750 261.700500 uh primarily because it s[eems]- it seems to be a little more 
sw3431B-ms98-a-0067 261.700500 265.223250 um what do i wanna say
sw3431B-ms98-a-0068 265.223250 270.757000 well not so much that it seems to hold up a little bit better towards the nicks and dings
sw3431B-ms98-a-0069 270.757000 273.573625 as opposed to uh
sw3431B-ms98-a-0070 273.573625 276.028000 a latex type paint
sw3431B-ms98-a-0071 276.028000 282.741500 and uh it just you know it it gives you a a variance even though it's the same color
sw3431B-ms98-a-0072 282.741500 283.749875 [silence]
sw3431B-ms98-a-0073 283.749875 286.264125 so it's worked out pretty well for us
sw3431B-ms98-a-0074 286.264125 289.225375 [silence]
sw3431B-ms98-a-0075 289.225375 298.466000 uh quite a bit painted a couple of houses uh recently this summer we painted a uh out building which is a shed that we have on the prop[erty]-
