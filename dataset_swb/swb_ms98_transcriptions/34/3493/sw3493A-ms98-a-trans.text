sw3493A-ms98-a-0002 1.567500 6.476375 well uh this is a good topic for me because i just got off a jury on Friday [laughter]

sw3493A-ms98-a-0004 10.093375 12.164375 uh-huh
sw3493A-ms98-a-0005 12.164375 14.896000 really what kind of a trial was it
sw3493A-ms98-a-0006 14.896000 16.003125 [silence]
sw3493A-ms98-a-0007 16.003125 17.458750 uh-huh
sw3493A-ms98-a-0008 17.458750 23.485625 [silence]
sw3493A-ms98-a-0009 23.485625 27.186625 oh really what what did you think was wrong with it
sw3493A-ms98-a-0010 27.186625 32.469500 [silence]
sw3493A-ms98-a-0011 32.469500 33.855500 uh-huh
sw3493A-ms98-a-0012 33.855500 34.876250 [silence]
sw3493A-ms98-a-0013 34.876250 36.131625 uh-huh
sw3493A-ms98-a-0014 36.131625 37.158250 [silence]
sw3493A-ms98-a-0015 37.158250 38.464250 uh-huh
sw3493A-ms98-a-0016 38.464250 42.465125 [silence]
sw3493A-ms98-a-0017 42.465125 43.861500 uh-huh
sw3493A-ms98-a-0018 43.861500 45.691125 yeah
sw3493A-ms98-a-0019 45.691125 46.896750 [silence]
sw3493A-ms98-a-0020 46.896750 48.808875 wow
sw3493A-ms98-a-0021 48.808875 50.398750 yeah
sw3493A-ms98-a-0022 50.398750 52.081625 um-hum
sw3493A-ms98-a-0023 52.081625 54.254500 [silence]
sw3493A-ms98-a-0024 54.254500 56.805000 hm that's interesting
sw3493A-ms98-a-0025 56.805000 59.248500 [silence]
sw3493A-ms98-a-0026 59.248500 60.487000 really
sw3493A-ms98-a-0027 60.487000 65.725625 [silence]
sw3493A-ms98-a-0028 65.725625 67.625250 wow that's
sw3493A-ms98-a-0029 67.625250 78.135750 well i've been on two actually and the first one i was on was also a civil trial but it was real apparent to all of us what what the situation was so it was real simple
sw3493A-ms98-a-0030 78.135750 83.805500 um and we only deliberated as maybe three hours and we weren't really deliberating we were reading through the whole charge
sw3493A-ms98-a-0031 83.805500 93.225000 and and trying to understand what the judge had written but i mean beyond that we really didn't have much debate um but the one i just got off of was capital murder trial
sw3493A-ms98-a-0032 93.225000 106.677500 and uh that uh um i don't know if it's fortunate or not i was an alternate so i sat through five days of the trial and it's sort of like seeing five days of a movie and missing the last ten minutes because i don't know what happened yet
sw3493A-ms98-a-0033 106.677500 108.128000 and [noise]
sw3493A-ms98-a-0034 108.128000 119.017125 that's right that's right and they also they can't report it on TV or anything so i don't know you know until it's completely over i won't know what happened
sw3493A-ms98-a-0035 119.017125 123.385000 so it was it was really interesting and and i can see
sw3493A-ms98-a-0036 123.385000 124.967125 [silence]
sw3493A-ms98-a-0037 124.967125 131.808625 i- i was leaning one way or another but i really needed to look at some of the evidence to make sure
sw3493A-ms98-a-0038 131.808625 142.833000 but it it you know it was fairly clear and i talked to the judge afterwards and you know and knowing what i know know now which the other jurors didn't know i'd definitely convict the guy
sw3493A-ms98-a-0039 142.833000 148.316750 because he was he was found involved in two more of them and he was caught on the scene a the third one
sw3493A-ms98-a-0040 148.316750 160.415375 so it was it was fairly obvious you know that he had done it and eventually i'm sure one of the in one of the three trials they'll probably convict him if not the first but uh
sw3493A-ms98-a-0041 160.415375 165.050625 this is the first one they tried him on yes so it was it was
sw3493A-ms98-a-0042 165.050625 168.495875 um i'm in North Dallas where are you
sw3493A-ms98-a-0043 168.495875 175.005250 oh okay well this happened in Plano [laughter] you'll be thrilled to know [laughter]
sw3493A-ms98-a-0044 175.005250 176.555125 excuse me
sw3493A-ms98-a-0045 176.555125 186.972875 um well the one i was involved was at uh Warehouse Beverage it's on uh i think it's Fifteenth and Avenue K and the one he was later involved in was the Texaco one
sw3493A-ms98-a-0046 186.972875 189.757000 and i don't know what the third one was
sw3493A-ms98-a-0047 189.757000 191.936500 but the Texaco one
sw3493A-ms98-a-0048 191.936500 193.313000 yeah that
sw3493A-ms98-a-0049 193.313000 194.470125 [silence]
sw3493A-ms98-a-0050 194.470125 202.569500 on Friday but that was just the the guilt and innocence phase and i don't know you know then there is the punishment phase after that
sw3493A-ms98-a-0051 202.569500 204.338000 [silence]
sw3493A-ms98-a-0052 204.338000 212.858250 um well all they can decide they don't really t[ell]- say we want capital punishment or we want something or life imprisonment
sw3493A-ms98-a-0053 212.858250 220.199250 you know if they find him guilty those are the two options for capital murder but they had six six choices what he was guilty of uh
sw3493A-ms98-a-0054 220.199250 228.048250 but all they can do there is three questions that they have to evaluate one being could he be a future threat to people well he's already proven that
sw3493A-ms98-a-0055 228.048250 235.037875 but you know a couple questions like that and your answers are yes or no and if you get i think it is three yeses it's capital punishment
sw3493A-ms98-a-0056 235.037875 245.493750 or you can decide if there is mitigating fact or something to that effect but it's not like you go and say you know we we recommend this punishment you just say we answered these questions this way
sw3493A-ms98-a-0057 245.493750 249.019625 and it leads you to the punishment yeah
sw3493A-ms98-a-0058 249.019625 255.741750 so it was really interesting and i wish i knew if they were still in deliberations but i don't [laughter]
sw3493A-ms98-a-0059 255.741750 257.153875 so
sw3493A-ms98-a-0060 257.153875 269.712750 Friday they went into deliberations but i don't know if the press can report at the end of the [vocalized-noise] the guilt and innocence phase or if they have to wait until the whole punishment thing is over because that will take another couple weeks
sw3493A-ms98-a-0061 269.712750 274.216375 so but it was it was really interesting
sw3493A-ms98-a-0062 274.216375 284.525875 well i it i learned a lot what i didn't enjoy was not being able to plan anything in my whole life because_1 i mean as far as i knew this could take months some of them do
sw3493A-ms98-a-0063 284.525875 290.840625 and that was the thing you know with Christmas and everything and i couldn't make reservations to go home but uh
sw3493A-ms98-a-0064 290.840625 294.418375 you know now that it's over it was really interesting
sw3493A-ms98-a-0065 294.418375 297.986000 um Nathan or Nathaniel White
