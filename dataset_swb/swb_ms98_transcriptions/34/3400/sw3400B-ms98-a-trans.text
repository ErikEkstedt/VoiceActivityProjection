sw3400B-ms98-a-0027 88.301250 94.480500 oh i don't think any of our papers in the area are great papers you might have had a really excellent one
sw3400B-ms98-a-0028 94.480500 102.337375 but you know you have to get a local paper or you won't know what's going on that's why i get the Fort Worth one which i didn't do for years before we moved over here but
sw3400B-ms98-a-0029 102.337375 107.553875 it's the only way i could find out what was going on in my own city of Arlington so i had to [laughter-subscribe] [laughter-to] it finally [laughter]
sw3400B-ms98-a-0030 107.553875 109.032625 [silence]

sw3400B-ms98-a-0034 114.520250 121.169875 yeah well the editorial page is pretty good of course they you know it's all things they get from other places
sw3400B-ms98-a-0035 121.169875 124.473125 but uh i'm not really thrilled with with the paper
sw3400B-ms98-a-0036 124.473125 126.606000 [silence]
sw3400B-ms98-a-0037 126.606000 129.652375 yeah i listen to that quite a bit when i can

sw3400B-ms98-a-0039 132.995500 138.278250 yeah you really get a whole story you know the news on television is probably i think the worst source
sw3400B-ms98-a-0040 138.278250 149.265125 because it's like eight minutes of top news out of the whole half hour by the time you take all those you know the ads and the sports and the features and the the cute little talk you know [laughter]
sw3400B-ms98-a-0041 149.265125 153.606625 [silence]
sw3400B-ms98-a-0042 153.606625 159.128625 uh i'll catch the ten o'clock sometimes or if there's a story that i'm really interested in i'll i'll try to

sw3400B-ms98-a-0044 160.779625 164.679875 oh i love Nightline yeah i like that
sw3400B-ms98-a-0045 164.679875 171.013875 yeah it really is if you have to do something early where do you work do you work at TI No you don't work at TI do you
sw3400B-ms98-a-0046 171.013875 172.255250 [silence]
sw3400B-ms98-a-0047 172.255250 175.062375 where where where do you have to drive to
sw3400B-ms98-a-0048 175.062375 176.700000 [silence]
sw3400B-ms98-a-0049 176.700000 181.863875 oh yeah you go against all that traffic i guess on LBJ or something
sw3400B-ms98-a-0050 181.863875 183.190500 [silence]
sw3400B-ms98-a-0051 183.190500 184.504375 oh
sw3400B-ms98-a-0052 184.504375 195.185625 yeah well my husband drives from here in Arlington to TI on Central [laughter] well yeah that he listens to a lot of news [laughter] but
sw3400B-ms98-a-0053 195.185625 196.200375 [silence]
sw3400B-ms98-a-0054 196.200375 203.750750 yeah um well just Time as far as news i mean we get a lot of magazines but that that's the only news one that i get
sw3400B-ms98-a-0055 203.750750 211.274000 oh yeah oh uh well i didn't like it this week it was just all about California and i d[on't]- don't care that much about [laughter] uh did you get it this week
sw3400B-ms98-a-0056 211.274000 213.691500 the whole issue's is that oh
sw3400B-ms98-a-0057 213.691500 216.011250 [silence]
sw3400B-ms98-a-0058 216.011250 217.174250 uh-huh
sw3400B-ms98-a-0059 217.174250 220.817625 [silence]
sw3400B-ms98-a-0060 220.817625 230.897375 well that's true no we do get Time and um i i read it pretty well you know i especially read the political news uh um i like to keep up with that but um
sw3400B-ms98-a-0061 230.897375 239.961000 like you said i think the best source of all is the Public Radio [laughter] and N[ightline]- well Nightline's great especially when something exciting is going on you know
sw3400B-ms98-a-0062 239.961000 247.733875 then i then i'll really make a poi[nt]- well you know it used to come on at ten thirty which was better but then they put that silly Entertainment Tonight
sw3400B-ms98-a-0063 247.733875 249.526000 right
sw3400B-ms98-a-0064 249.526000 252.253875 [silence]
sw3400B-ms98-a-0065 252.253875 253.813375 oh was it
sw3400B-ms98-a-0066 253.813375 255.118250 yeah
sw3400B-ms98-a-0067 255.118250 264.660625 i know i wish it would come on earlier but obviously the sitcoms make more money or they you know or they wouldn't have it on at eleven [laughter] but uh
sw3400B-ms98-a-0068 264.660625 275.514875 [noise] uh well i guess we've exhausted that subject [laughter] well who do you think's going to run for President next year since you're up on all your news [laughter]
sw3400B-ms98-a-0069 275.514875 277.953250 guess we've got Bush again but [laughter]
sw3400B-ms98-a-0070 277.953250 281.082000 [silence]
sw3400B-ms98-a-0071 281.082000 283.012500 right
sw3400B-ms98-a-0072 283.012500 288.990375 Patrick Buchanan supposedly was thinking of running against Bush or he just announced today
sw3400B-ms98-a-0073 288.990375 293.335250 i don't know if he's announced or he's thinking about it but it was on the news
sw3400B-ms98-a-0074 293.335250 295.782625 [silence]
sw3400B-ms98-a-0075 295.782625 298.169125 well i would think but it
sw3400B-ms98-a-0076 298.169125 299.842000 uh it might scare Bush a little
