sw3413B-ms98-a-0006 24.603250 36.146750 uh-huh yeah no i- i agree with you there um i've gone to other states where there's no food tax you know some things there aren't taxed at all and i think that that's really nice i think they that's what Texas needed
sw3413B-ms98-a-0007 36.146750 42.401375 to do also is to discriminate as to uh which should be taxed and what shouldn't be taxed so
sw3413B-ms98-a-0008 42.401375 44.894375 [silence]
sw3413B-ms98-a-0009 44.894375 46.326875 uh-huh
sw3413B-ms98-a-0010 46.326875 50.515375 [silence]
sw3413B-ms98-a-0011 50.515375 59.976250 no they do they do uh-huh yeah but i have lived in other states in which they don't uh tax uh food uh clothing items personal things like that
sw3413B-ms98-a-0012 59.976250 65.750375 and um so that was that was really neat but i guess the way that they get around it though is that there's no quote state
sw3413B-ms98-a-0013 65.750375 76.979250 income tax but then you pay [laughter] ten fifteen percent taxes um you know i know they say it's only eight and a quarter or whatever it is but uh but yeah i really think that it's it's way too much 
sw3413B-ms98-a-0014 76.979250 86.939375 uh whenever you buy an item especially a large purchase item it it's it's something in which you're you're paying and you've always got to add in that about_1 ten percent tax [laughter]
sw3413B-ms98-a-0015 86.939375 93.926250 [silence]
sw3413B-ms98-a-0016 93.926250 95.970625 in the last what

sw3413B-ms98-a-0019 102.115125 108.853875 well [noise] now for the city of Plano um i really like the the things that they offer here
sw3413B-ms98-a-0020 108.853875 120.260000 um i and i can't say that for for all of Dallas or all of Texas um but for Plano i do i really think that i get my my money's worth they always seem to be ahead of any other um
sw3413B-ms98-a-0021 120.260000 132.276875 city and in the things such as uh you know separating out your glass and your paper now and and uh having the great big you know gallon drums uh uh keeping Plano beautiful and and i think that they really do a good job at it too
sw3413B-ms98-a-0022 132.276875 133.980875 so yeah
sw3413B-ms98-a-0023 133.980875 137.043625 [silence]

sw3413B-ms98-a-0028 150.148625 162.889375 um-hum um-hum well and i think you get spoiled and you expect it whenever you go to any place else and it's just not quite up to standard or par and it's just like oh gee whiz you know it makes you really appreciate i think uh you know that your city
sw3413B-ms98-a-0029 162.889375 176.953000 and uh what it has to offer now as for the state you know i uh uh you know i guess the the highways outside of what metropolitan Dallas and Houston are okay [laughter]
sw3413B-ms98-a-0030 176.953000 178.197125 [noise]
sw3413B-ms98-a-0031 178.197125 188.327375 yeah and the outside i mean the your state highways i i think you know are are pretty a[dequate]- uh adequate but gosh you get into the cities [laughter-and] [laughter-you] might as well forget it um

sw3413B-ms98-a-0036 207.636625 214.243750 um but i i'm hoping that uh in a way people can can see that as a contribution then to the state
sw3413B-ms98-a-0037 214.243750 224.790875 um i did live in Ohio for a couple of years and i know that's how they kind of got around um you know having to uh taxes or increase in taxes was was by the lottery
sw3413B-ms98-a-0038 224.790875 234.959875 yeah yeah and and i know the people are concerned that it's only gonna be the the lower you know income people who are actually going to you know be the the biggest participants in this um
sw3413B-ms98-a-0039 234.959875 235.962250 [silence]
sw3413B-ms98-a-0040 235.962250 237.937375 right
sw3413B-ms98-a-0041 237.937375 246.833000 yeah yeah ab[solutely]- absolutely and um i only saw it as being you know really positive and of course it you know was just a fluke if you won
sw3413B-ms98-a-0042 246.833000 256.763375 you know because_1 i really never expected to win and and i never did the big big lottery we're talking about uh but you know every once in a while i'd come up with two or three dollars or something but
sw3413B-ms98-a-0043 256.763375 271.328250 i felt good in the sense that i was really putting my money the way i felt it was back into uh the taxes uh and it went actually most of it went to the schools and uh to school reforms things like this so uh yeah i i saw it really as a positive thing
sw3413B-ms98-a-0044 271.328250 275.327375 [silence]
sw3413B-ms98-a-0045 275.327375 280.498750 [laughter] y[ou]- you know i wa[s]- yeah
