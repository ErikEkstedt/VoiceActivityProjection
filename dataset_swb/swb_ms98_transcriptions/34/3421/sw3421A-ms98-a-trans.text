sw3421A-ms98-a-0006 17.278000 18.540750 [silence]
sw3421A-ms98-a-0007 18.540750 19.942625 uh-huh
sw3421A-ms98-a-0008 19.942625 32.787125 [silence]
sw3421A-ms98-a-0009 32.787125 35.525125 oh that was funny wasn't it [laughter]
sw3421A-ms98-a-0010 35.525125 40.992125 yes and and and and the regular Naked Gun and Airport and you know
sw3421A-ms98-a-0011 40.992125 42.704625 yes

sw3421A-ms98-a-0013 44.717250 46.102500 right
sw3421A-ms98-a-0014 46.102500 56.489625 so now these are fai[rly]- two very different movies one one [vocalized-noise] absolutely slapstick comedy and one clearly you know serious subject
sw3421A-ms98-a-0015 56.489625 62.991375 yeah i i guess i have similarly broad tastes um my most recent um
sw3421A-ms98-a-0016 62.991375 74.401750 movie that i that i liked a lot not my most recent movie was Henry the Fifth i o[nly]- only rented it you know maybe a month ago and it's been out for a couple of years but have you seen that
sw3421A-ms98-a-0017 74.401750 83.039125 well it's it's a it's an adaptation of the of the Shakespeare play uh and it is beautifully done um
sw3421A-ms98-a-0018 83.039125 90.484625 i believe that all the language is is Shakespeare read it except it's been shortened a little bit and there might be a word or two changed
sw3421A-ms98-a-0019 90.484625 101.307625 uh but it's it's it's a glorious movie [laughter] um and i like as you know these these these [vocalized-noise] si[lly]- silly movies
sw3421A-ms98-a-0020 101.307625 106.183500 and i also like just some s[trange]- strange movies do you do you have any
sw3421A-ms98-a-0021 106.183500 114.647500 [vocalized-noise] well th[e]- the one that comes immediately to mind i um is The Cook the Thief His Wife Her Lover
sw3421A-ms98-a-0022 114.647500 119.214000 um [vocalized-noise] but there also these various um
sw3421A-ms98-a-0023 119.214000 129.154500 [vocalized-noise] but David Lynch movies um i g[ot]- i got hooked on Twin Peaks that made me go out and watch every David Lynch movie i could lay my hands on
sw3421A-ms98-a-0024 129.154500 137.904000 oh um well i don't i don't especially recommend i mean [vocalized-noise] you have you have to just sort of like this th[ough]- you have to like did you see Twin Peaks
sw3421A-ms98-a-0025 137.904000 144.381125 no so okay so if you weren't if you weren't drawn to watch that you maybe wouldn't be drawn to these movies either
sw3421A-ms98-a-0026 144.381125 147.931875 they're they're just strange yeah
sw3421A-ms98-a-0027 147.931875 152.171125 [silence]
sw3421A-ms98-a-0028 152.171125 155.442625 oh well i[t]- [vocalized-noise] [noise]
sw3421A-ms98-a-0029 155.442625 163.612625 i think suspense is the right word um a[nd]- and but but little bit strange and esoteric and um
sw3421A-ms98-a-0030 163.612625 165.404750 [vocalized-noise]
sw3421A-ms98-a-0031 165.404750 169.700500 in the case of Twin Peaks a little bi[t]- there's some elements of the supernatural in it too
sw3421A-ms98-a-0032 169.700500 172.195750 that that was the television show
sw3421A-ms98-a-0033 172.195750 174.149375 um
sw3421A-ms98-a-0034 174.149375 179.002500 there's also a a a producer o[f]- of movies in Baltimore called um

sw3421A-ms98-a-0036 180.925875 184.218625 who who puts puts out even weirder movies
sw3421A-ms98-a-0037 184.218625 189.278125 h[e]- uh his most recent ones have actually been f[airly]- fairly mainstream like Hairspray
sw3421A-ms98-a-0038 189.278125 194.927875 um but back in his early days he he he had things um

sw3421A-ms98-a-0043 206.889250 213.639875 [vocalized-noise] quite a random crew of of characters um it would've made you know these Fellini movies look normal
sw3421A-ms98-a-0044 213.639875 217.068125 [silence]
