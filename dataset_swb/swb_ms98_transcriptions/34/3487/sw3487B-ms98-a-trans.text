sw3487B-ms98-a-0011 31.701500 43.229500 let's see when i when i went away to school i'm trying to think my criteria i guess when you're when you're eighteen or so um it would be important to know if it was a coed college [laughter] that was a
sw3487B-ms98-a-0012 43.229500 52.010125 a a strict requirement for me um again w[hat]- w[hat]- what um how serious a person is according to uh um
sw3487B-ms98-a-0013 52.010125 56.406250 you know what what they want to get out of school and um
sw3487B-ms98-a-0014 56.406250 69.665000 i guess i'd have to consider how expensive the college is and how close to home if they could handle being away for real long periods of time or if they need to be somewhere where they can drive home when they needed to get home
sw3487B-ms98-a-0015 69.665000 71.048000 um
sw3487B-ms98-a-0016 71.048000 72.431000 let's see
sw3487B-ms98-a-0017 72.431000 77.482625 uh now what was the question what what's the criteria for picking a college
sw3487B-ms98-a-0018 77.482625 81.613125 what advice oh okay um
sw3487B-ms98-a-0019 81.613125 88.971125 [silence]
sw3487B-ms98-a-0020 88.971125 90.187375 yes
sw3487B-ms98-a-0021 90.187375 95.207500 [silence]
sw3487B-ms98-a-0022 95.207500 105.839000 yes and also um depending on how um uh [vocalized-noise] adjustable your child would be or or flexible i guess it would be um
sw3487B-ms98-a-0023 105.839000 112.996875 if if they chose a college in a different part of the country that maybe the they were unused to their
sw3487B-ms98-a-0024 112.996875 121.012375 the the way they run things i mean the the northern colleges are very different than the southern colleges i think the people are different and uh
sw3487B-ms98-a-0025 121.012375 135.842750 you have to be more flexible and more willing to um um adjust to other people's mannerisms and customs or ways of doing things you know you have to be a flexible person to be able to go all the way across
sw3487B-ms98-a-0026 135.842750 140.521750 country to something totally different than what you're used to um
sw3487B-ms98-a-0027 140.521750 142.573000 [silence]
sw3487B-ms98-a-0028 142.573000 144.447625 you think so [laughter]
sw3487B-ms98-a-0029 144.447625 145.471125 [silence]

sw3487B-ms98-a-0033 151.280625 152.387625 [silence]
sw3487B-ms98-a-0034 152.387625 161.395750 well climate would be you know you'd have to you know is somewhat if uh if it's something different than the what they used to i guess um
sw3487B-ms98-a-0035 161.395750 173.742750 if they're used to the northern weather then the southern weather they might kind of feel like they need to go out and play all the time not be [laughter] in [laughter-studying] if you're in Florida or California um
sw3487B-ms98-a-0036 173.742750 180.463375 i'd i'd also advise them_1 that um if mom and dad paid for their college that um if they
sw3487B-ms98-a-0037 180.463375 187.912875 decided to drop a course or decided that they needed another year that then they'd have to take out a loan to continue [laughter]
sw3487B-ms98-a-0038 187.912875 197.488250 [silence]
sw3487B-ms98-a-0039 197.488250 198.451250 r[ight]-
sw3487B-ms98-a-0040 198.451250 200.450750 [silence]
sw3487B-ms98-a-0041 200.450750 202.922625 that's right there's
sw3487B-ms98-a-0042 202.922625 208.411875 [silence]
sw3487B-ms98-a-0043 208.411875 213.397250 the the responsibility of that and uh um um
sw3487B-ms98-a-0044 213.397250 215.581125 they could they could work and m[oney]-
sw3487B-ms98-a-0045 215.581125 227.437250 earn money towards college and also if they stay within their state you get a lot more financial aid or uh it's a lot cheaper if you stay within your state than if you go out of state to a private school um
sw3487B-ms98-a-0046 227.437250 232.054750 and like i said if they was willing to work um in the summers
sw3487B-ms98-a-0047 232.054750 245.137375 and also maybe then the parents could pay a third and then maybe they could take out a loan for a third depending on how expensive it is by the time i have an eleven year old is my oldest so it's not too far away but it's
sw3487B-ms98-a-0048 245.137375 253.389250 oh okay but it's getting there i- i mean we still have definitely can put away the money for college now um
sw3487B-ms98-a-0049 253.389250 254.484750 [silence]
sw3487B-ms98-a-0050 254.484750 259.733000 i would advise that that they did not have a car at college they would

sw3487B-ms98-a-0052 260.770750 266.063625 [silence]

sw3487B-ms98-a-0057 273.166375 280.572375 i think so too i think i think because most kids don't have a car at college the ones that do get taken advantage of
sw3487B-ms98-a-0058 280.572375 289.920000 and you know there's just i think it's just trouble waiting to happen so i would advise they didn't they didn't take a car and um
sw3487B-ms98-a-0059 289.920000 297.523250 they didn't take a television and they didn't take a [laughter-refrigerator] well maybe that [laughter] no i i
