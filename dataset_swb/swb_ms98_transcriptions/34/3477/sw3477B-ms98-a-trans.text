sw3477B-ms98-a-0014 43.451250 46.547375 [silence]
sw3477B-ms98-a-0015 46.547375 48.592750 boy i'll say
sw3477B-ms98-a-0016 48.592750 50.939000 [silence]
sw3477B-ms98-a-0017 50.939000 52.306250 uh-huh

sw3477B-ms98-a-0020 58.921500 63.996375 [silence]
sw3477B-ms98-a-0021 63.996375 66.408125 oh that's an idea
sw3477B-ms98-a-0022 66.408125 70.273375 yeah well no we don't [laughter] not
sw3477B-ms98-a-0023 70.273375 73.921375 yeah we have the voting but uh i never heard of
sw3477B-ms98-a-0024 73.921375 76.053625 [silence]
sw3477B-ms98-a-0025 76.053625 77.973375 oh wow
sw3477B-ms98-a-0026 77.973375 79.147125 oh
sw3477B-ms98-a-0027 79.147125 80.182500 [silence]
sw3477B-ms98-a-0028 80.182500 90.237750 it's Mantua it's just a small small community we probably only have like oh seventy well maybe seven hundred people [laughter] not very many
sw3477B-ms98-a-0029 90.237750 98.016125 right so when we vote it's like you say there's it's a handful of of votes makes a difference in fact this last November they had a
sw3477B-ms98-a-0030 98.016125 104.035875 vote and i think there was only like oh five to ten votes within the three different
sw3477B-ms98-a-0031 104.035875 108.165250 you know the three different people that were runn[ing]- for for the office of
sw3477B-ms98-a-0032 108.165250 110.237250 yes yes
sw3477B-ms98-a-0033 110.237250 118.294250 in each of them_1 and so like you say it makes a difference but that's that's a good idea about having it the voting over the phone maybe someday it will
sw3477B-ms98-a-0034 118.294250 120.725125 it will a come [vocalized-noise]
sw3477B-ms98-a-0035 120.725125 121.758875 [silence]
sw3477B-ms98-a-0036 121.758875 122.754625 uh-huh

sw3477B-ms98-a-0041 128.341500 129.986625 [silence]
sw3477B-ms98-a-0042 129.986625 133.922125 right and you know i wonder i don't know what the
sw3477B-ms98-a-0043 133.922125 142.048875 [satistics/statistics] are but i wonder what age um the least has the least good turn out for the voting
sw3477B-ms98-a-0044 142.048875 145.049375 [silence]
sw3477B-ms98-a-0045 145.049375 153.248375 i wonder if it's the younger people or the older people or just in the middle-aged or or who it is that doesn't turn out my guess would be the younger
sw3477B-ms98-a-0046 153.248375 156.995000 [silence]
sw3477B-ms98-a-0047 156.995000 158.291750 um-hum
sw3477B-ms98-a-0048 158.291750 159.324625 [silence]
sw3477B-ms98-a-0049 159.324625 161.014625 oh
sw3477B-ms98-a-0050 161.014625 163.686875 [silence]
sw3477B-ms98-a-0051 163.686875 164.987375 oh
sw3477B-ms98-a-0052 164.987375 166.043500 [silence]
sw3477B-ms98-a-0053 166.043500 168.856000 oh just because they don't care
sw3477B-ms98-a-0054 168.856000 171.050500 [silence]
sw3477B-ms98-a-0055 171.050500 172.361250 oh
sw3477B-ms98-a-0056 172.361250 176.845250 [silence]
sw3477B-ms98-a-0057 176.845250 177.831875 uh-huh
sw3477B-ms98-a-0058 177.831875 180.068625 [laughter]

sw3477B-ms98-a-0060 182.076250 184.019500 [silence]
sw3477B-ms98-a-0061 184.019500 191.149000 right and i don't know how big of a problem this is but i wonder if i've heard some people say on occasion that
sw3477B-ms98-a-0062 191.149000 200.294375 that the the candidates they don't care for any of them_1 so they don't want to you know they don't want to give their [vate/vote] vote for one or of other just because_1 they [laughter]
sw3477B-ms98-a-0063 200.294375 201.360750 [silence]
sw3477B-ms98-a-0064 201.360750 202.745250 uh-huh
sw3477B-ms98-a-0065 202.745250 204.116250 [silence]
sw3477B-ms98-a-0066 204.116250 208.427750 right right that that's some that's saying hey you know we want somebody
sw3477B-ms98-a-0067 208.427750 219.679750 better for the candidate i don't know i think that's kind of a cop out [laughter] i really do i think you ought to you know make your opinion one way or the other there i mean if you even if you don't agree with
sw3477B-ms98-a-0068 219.679750 222.440250 [silence]
sw3477B-ms98-a-0069 222.440250 223.818000 right
sw3477B-ms98-a-0070 223.818000 226.058125 [laughter]
sw3477B-ms98-a-0071 226.058125 228.765500 right we have
sw3477B-ms98-a-0072 228.765500 231.503000 [silence]
sw3477B-ms98-a-0073 231.503000 237.728125 [laughter] and so this last election here in in our community they had
sw3477B-ms98-a-0074 237.728125 246.838875 um they counted them_1 by hand you know the ballots by hand and i know that on the bigger ones they have little it's a punch card system are you familiar with that
sw3477B-ms98-a-0075 246.838875 249.390375 [silence]
sw3477B-ms98-a-0076 249.390375 255.543375 right you you h[ave]- with your pencil you just punch you know they have a little tray that holds the ballots
sw3477B-ms98-a-0077 255.543375 259.977500 and and apparently it makes the the counting a lot easier for the
sw3477B-ms98-a-0078 259.977500 265.714875 for those that are counting it but um [noise] with just the small ones they just go ahead and count it
sw3477B-ms98-a-0079 265.714875 273.598000 by hand and i really liked the the punch card one because we got the results so much sooner when it was over
sw3477B-ms98-a-0080 273.598000 276.072750 [silence]
sw3477B-ms98-a-0081 276.072750 277.390500 uh-huh
sw3477B-ms98-a-0082 277.390500 278.492375 [silence]
sw3477B-ms98-a-0083 278.492375 282.988625 oh oh yeah that would be they probably can turn those results in
sw3477B-ms98-a-0084 282.988625 284.037500 [silence]
sw3477B-ms98-a-0085 284.037500 285.479500 uh-huh
sw3477B-ms98-a-0086 285.479500 288.237625 [silence]
sw3477B-ms98-a-0087 288.237625 289.924000 oh
sw3477B-ms98-a-0088 289.924000 293.359750 [silence]
sw3477B-ms98-a-0089 293.359750 295.758250 oh wow that's fascinating
sw3477B-ms98-a-0090 295.758250 298.562000 oh so have you ever run for any kind of
