sw3477A-ms98-a-0004 6.935500 10.893500 from Texas oh [laughter]
sw3477A-ms98-a-0005 10.893500 17.287125 yes uh-huh uh why we think there's such a short[age]- uh low turn out
sw3477A-ms98-a-0006 17.287125 19.739500 [silence]
sw3477A-ms98-a-0007 19.739500 28.623750 okay well i think there's a uh a mult[iple]- multiple reasons i think first of all a lot of people are fed up and they think they don't really their vote doesn't count
sw3477A-ms98-a-0008 28.623750 34.908500 and second of all a lot of people just aren't educated to you know that they should do that [laughter] they should participate
sw3477A-ms98-a-0009 34.908500 36.042500 [silence]
sw3477A-ms98-a-0010 36.042500 42.910500 right we had uh city councilman here that won by like a handful of votes you know ten votes or something
sw3477A-ms98-a-0011 42.910500 47.726875 [noise] so that would have made a big difference if people had turned out for his opponent [laughter]
sw3477A-ms98-a-0012 47.726875 51.486250 and i think another reason sometimes it's inconvenient
sw3477A-ms98-a-0013 51.486250 59.918625 the hours especially in a presidential election i don't know why it couldn't go on for several days or why we couldn't even phone in our vote you know you can you can uh
