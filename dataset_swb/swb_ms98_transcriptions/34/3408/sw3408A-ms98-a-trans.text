sw3408A-ms98-a-0002 10.477125 13.994625 so i thought that was kind of an in[teresting]- interesting coincidence
sw3408A-ms98-a-0003 13.994625 16.871000 [silence]
sw3408A-ms98-a-0004 16.871000 20.871125 uh Northern State University in Aberdeen South Dakota
sw3408A-ms98-a-0005 20.871125 22.568375 [silence]

sw3408A-ms98-a-0012 37.858500 41.673125 well that sounds interesting ah how long of a program is that
sw3408A-ms98-a-0013 41.673125 43.649000 [laughter]
sw3408A-ms98-a-0014 43.649000 53.416375 [silence]
sw3408A-ms98-a-0015 53.416375 56.602000 you know i read a study once and it said that uh
sw3408A-ms98-a-0016 56.602000 59.153750 like thirty four percent
sw3408A-ms98-a-0017 59.153750 66.115750 of uh college students actually graduate in four years from a four year program
sw3408A-ms98-a-0018 66.115750 68.711250 it took me it took me five years
sw3408A-ms98-a-0019 68.711250 69.895125 [silence]
sw3408A-ms98-a-0020 69.895125 81.226125 you know you just you get started an[d]- and you change your mind or you wanna pick up a second major if you're management you you you decide i'll i'll take that marketing it's just what three more classes
sw3408A-ms98-a-0021 81.226125 85.105375 you know and it it ju[st]- just doesn't happen that you get out in four years
sw3408A-ms98-a-0022 85.105375 86.366125 [silence]
sw3408A-ms98-a-0023 86.366125 87.712375 but
sw3408A-ms98-a-0024 87.712375 90.298625 [silence]
sw3408A-ms98-a-0025 90.298625 93.817500 my advice is is uh
sw3408A-ms98-a-0026 93.817500 97.472875 look for at the student to faculty ratio
sw3408A-ms98-a-0027 97.472875 104.004500 you know if you're gonna go to a college where student faculty ratio is three and four hundred to one
sw3408A-ms98-a-0028 104.004500 111.591875 i don't think you're gonna have as meaningful of of a college experience as if you're down to the thirty to forty to one
sw3408A-ms98-a-0029 111.591875 113.834875 [silence]
sw3408A-ms98-a-0030 113.834875 116.769000 yeah ours was about twenty six to one
sw3408A-ms98-a-0031 116.769000 118.046000 yeah
sw3408A-ms98-a-0032 118.046000 119.549000 [silence]
sw3408A-ms98-a-0033 119.549000 127.304125 which is you know it it's interesting but it it's what i thought was nice is you could al[ways]- there was always time to talk to professor
sw3408A-ms98-a-0034 127.304125 130.142750 you know and and they knew you
sw3408A-ms98-a-0035 130.142750 132.988250 you weren't just in their class you know and
sw3408A-ms98-a-0036 132.988250 140.643250 so you could you could go talk to them_1 in their office hours at any time and or if you ran into them_1 in the student union or whatever
sw3408A-ms98-a-0037 140.643250 145.749375 you know you could sit down and talk to them_1 about a problem they were always willing to help you out so
sw3408A-ms98-a-0038 145.749375 147.678125 but our house
sw3408A-ms98-a-0039 147.678125 149.584250 i i
sw3408A-ms98-a-0040 149.584250 158.382000 put that against uh my high school where we had uh a biology class of three hundred and fifty students and
sw3408A-ms98-a-0041 158.382000 162.372250 yeah it was a biology lecture class
sw3408A-ms98-a-0042 162.372250 164.751375 and you know i[t]- it
sw3408A-ms98-a-0043 164.751375 169.006750 it just wasn't the same you're sitting there and you're taking notes and
sw3408A-ms98-a-0044 169.006750 182.805750 you know you got a computerized test scores with multiple choice because there's no way they could correct a three hundred fifty point short answer test or you know a three hundred and three hundred and fifty person short answer test 
sw3408A-ms98-a-0045 182.805750 190.088875 and it just wasn't the same you you'd run you'd pass the teacher in high school you know and even in high school you could say hi to your teachers an[d]-
sw3408A-ms98-a-0046 190.088875 197.088000 unless you're in that biology class and they just you know they'd look at you like do i know you or should i know you
sw3408A-ms98-a-0047 197.088000 207.718750 [silence]
sw3408A-ms98-a-0048 207.718750 210.268250 do you get uh a lot of tutoring or
sw3408A-ms98-a-0049 210.268250 216.536000 [silence]

sw3408A-ms98-a-0054 228.804750 238.232125 and you could get there and his office hours could i mean he could have like a nine to eleven in the morning office hours and have forty two people waiting to talk to him and you still wouldn't get to talk to him anyway
sw3408A-ms98-a-0055 238.232125 239.296250 [silence]

sw3408A-ms98-a-0059 259.451625 274.426875 [silence]
sw3408A-ms98-a-0060 274.426875 278.784625 well it it it does get it you know you get to the point where it's
sw3408A-ms98-a-0061 278.784625 280.946750 i'm never gonna get done
sw3408A-ms98-a-0062 280.946750 284.672125 you know i i mean i was taking summer classes and
sw3408A-ms98-a-0063 284.672125 287.606375 finally i s[aid]- let me get out of here
sw3408A-ms98-a-0064 287.606375 298.466000 but uh no that's good advice even if you don't have your major decided on have an idea of what you think you might want you know [vocalized-noise] so you don't want management but you think you want business
