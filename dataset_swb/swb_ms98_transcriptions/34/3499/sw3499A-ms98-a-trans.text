sw3499A-ms98-a-0042 182.735000 187.401125 had a job for several years that i traveled just an awful lot
sw3499A-ms98-a-0043 187.401125 202.401000 and uh as a matter of fact i stayed gone more than i stayed at home yeah for about four years and i built up an awful lot of mileage so i've made three trips to London just using airfare you know airline mileage and so that's how i've been able to m[ake]- make those trips
sw3499A-ms98-a-0044 202.401000 207.519875 [silence]
sw3499A-ms98-a-0045 207.519875 213.791750 i i would go back to uh if i could go back anywhere right now i think i would go back to Edinburgh
sw3499A-ms98-a-0046 213.791750 215.007625 a[nd]-
sw3499A-ms98-a-0047 215.007625 219.413875 well because uh we i didn't go any farther north
sw3499A-ms98-a-0048 219.413875 234.299125 in Scotland than Edinburgh and uh my brother was over there a couple of years ago and he uh uh went [vocalized-noise] on a driving tour all up through the Scottish highlands and just came back just raving about how wonderful it was very very scenic very 
sw3499A-ms98-a-0049 234.299125 243.135250 beautiful and it's it's a part of the uh the country that's a little bit off the beaten path there're not as many tourists that go out there and i enjoyed uh
sw3499A-ms98-a-0050 243.135250 250.720000 Scotland so much but i could go back listen i could go back into London any day of the week and the beautiful thing about that is
sw3499A-ms98-a-0051 250.720000 259.456625 you could take a train out of London and head any direction it doesn't make any difference and take these fabulous day trips and anywhere you go is interesting
sw3499A-ms98-a-0052 259.456625 261.092125 and uh
sw3499A-ms98-a-0053 261.092125 264.261000 the last time we went we found this really uh
sw3499A-ms98-a-0054 264.261000 277.560875 small kind of quaint hotel actually we found it over there on the trip before but stayed in it the last time that was r[easonable]- reasonable and uh just used that as a base and then took day trips on the trains the train system is wonderful which makes me
sw3499A-ms98-a-0055 277.560875 287.896750 wonder when we'll ever get our act together here in the US and have a and have a decent um uh transportation system but we'd just take day trips and that was that was a nice way to do it
sw3499A-ms98-a-0056 287.896750 289.191500 [silence]
sw3499A-ms98-a-0057 289.191500 297.707875 i have been yeah we went uh the first time i went over there i went to Germany and went to Munich and stayed right across the street from one of the original medieval beer halls
