sw3470B-ms98-a-0003 4.700125 11.509875 uh that uh to be real honest i'm thinking about a truck as opposed to a car
sw3470B-ms98-a-0004 11.509875 25.089625 um uh uh probably some sort of utility type vehicle either a um m[y]- [noise] my particular favorite right at the moment is that Explorer the Ford um Explorer
sw3470B-ms98-a-0005 25.089625 36.610250 [silence]
sw3470B-ms98-a-0006 36.610250 38.153250 oh
sw3470B-ms98-a-0007 38.153250 39.852125 [silence]
sw3470B-ms98-a-0008 39.852125 54.256750 some other brand or something yeah no i just am i have looked for a long time i've i've had since i've been out of school i've mostly had uh you know German cars like um
sw3470B-ms98-a-0009 54.256750 61.583625 i had i mean you know used ones obviously [laughter] um i had a Mercedes sedan and then i had a BMW
sw3470B-ms98-a-0010 61.583625 63.033375 [silence]
sw3470B-ms98-a-0011 63.033375 76.801500 w[ell]- they're excellent cars and if you uh my uh i was a little partial to the Mercedes i think i almost wish i'd kept it it was old it was by the time i sold it it was about f[ifteen]- thirteen or fifteen years old
sw3470B-ms98-a-0012 76.801500 79.089375 oh jeez um
sw3470B-ms98-a-0013 79.089375 81.184000 [laughter] ah
sw3470B-ms98-a-0014 81.184000 93.892625 [vocalized-noise] at least i mean the the the year model that i had was one that that um they say that those engines are built to be completely torn down and rebuilt like at least three times 
sw3470B-ms98-a-0015 93.892625 96.099625 that's the amount of metal that they have in them_1
sw3470B-ms98-a-0016 96.099625 103.110250 that Mercedes really i mean the way look at a car is they built you know they build this car you buy this car you can drive this car your whole life
sw3470B-ms98-a-0017 103.110250 112.670875 [silence]
sw3470B-ms98-a-0018 112.670875 116.662000 i think they don't build them_1 to hold up to that for something
sw3470B-ms98-a-0019 116.662000 119.247000 [silence]
sw3470B-ms98-a-0020 119.247000 127.818250 yeah that's probably and all this computerized stuff is fine and good but you know something goes wrong and and it seems like
sw3470B-ms98-a-0021 127.818250 138.821500 you know it's like y[eah]- yeah you can't fix anything anymore you have to replace entire parts or something you know you can't you know back in the olden days [laughter]
sw3470B-ms98-a-0022 138.821500 140.258375 [noise]
sw3470B-ms98-a-0023 140.258375 141.806750 i live in Dallas
sw3470B-ms98-a-0024 141.806750 143.008750 yeah
sw3470B-ms98-a-0025 143.008750 146.875375 [silence]
sw3470B-ms98-a-0026 146.875375 151.888625 yeah i mean i don't know i just i- i do a lot of stuff myself because 
sw3470B-ms98-a-0027 151.888625 161.642625 it seems like if you take something to a dealership you know they are even more inclined to not fix something and just like replace the entire part
sw3470B-ms98-a-0028 161.642625 172.977500 and and and they don't seem to really know how to do anything else you know what i call parts changers and and so i get myself a little book and i start fixing a lot of stuff myself
sw3470B-ms98-a-0029 172.977500 175.279375 [laughter-yeah] [laughter]
sw3470B-ms98-a-0030 175.279375 184.424500 if it's a very new one i wouldn't even begin to you know all this computer stuff just loses me i don't like to look under the engine of the car and not see anything i recognize you know
sw3470B-ms98-a-0031 184.424500 188.738875 [silence]
sw3470B-ms98-a-0032 188.738875 190.489000 oh yeah
sw3470B-ms98-a-0033 190.489000 196.205250 [silence]
sw3470B-ms98-a-0034 196.205250 205.175750 yeah i i think because the whole system wasn't designed with that in mind in the first place so they just came up with something they could slap on after the fact
sw3470B-ms98-a-0035 205.175750 211.850875 you know i mean if if if you really wanted to i mean you know if we can send people to the moon
sw3470B-ms98-a-0036 211.850875 222.466625 we can sure have engineers that can sit down and design a fairly efficient engine that would also be good for the environment
sw3470B-ms98-a-0037 222.466625 230.463375 but the you know there's no percentages in doing that there's too much i mean they can make too much money [laughter-doing] [laughter-the] doing the other way around or something
sw3470B-ms98-a-0038 230.463375 240.012250 [silence]
sw3470B-ms98-a-0039 240.012250 243.007625 and i'll tell you you know the thing i worry about is
sw3470B-ms98-a-0040 243.007625 253.530250 that's strictly short term i mean that you know we know that our oil supply is running out you know and what happens when it does is what i want to know
sw3470B-ms98-a-0041 253.530250 260.478750 i mean i may not have to worry about it because_1 it happen in my lifetime but i worry about it anyway because i know it's out there
sw3470B-ms98-a-0042 260.478750 262.470625 i don't know it's just
sw3470B-ms98-a-0043 262.470625 263.516750 [silence]
sw3470B-ms98-a-0044 263.516750 266.587250 well that's you know [laughter]
sw3470B-ms98-a-0045 266.587250 267.660500 [silence]
sw3470B-ms98-a-0046 267.660500 276.029375 this well this is true you could just like have them_1 out there i don't know in the pasture grazing and there's not much fixing with them either
sw3470B-ms98-a-0047 276.029375 281.213750 i don't know i don't know that i'd want to have to rely on that as my transportation but
sw3470B-ms98-a-0048 281.213750 292.356250 i don't know i just you know i've been looking at at some things and like i say i've been looking at these Explorers and these other kind of you know Blazers and whatnot and you know they open up the hood and they say
sw3470B-ms98-a-0049 292.356250 294.093250 you know it
sw3470B-ms98-a-0050 294.093250 299.618000 i don't know they but they say they open up the hood they show you all these modern advances they've made and they show
