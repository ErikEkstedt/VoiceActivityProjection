sw3404A-ms98-a-0009 44.608250 55.190500 just in a cross stitch frenzy because i cannot stand being in the same room with the TV on with all the sports so so much that i have to sit i can sit there as long as i'm cross stitching and
sw3404A-ms98-a-0010 55.190500 62.433250 while i'm doing that so that that's that's one of my my favorite hobbies that i that i like to what what about you

sw3404A-ms98-a-0016 74.757000 81.664625 [silence]
sw3404A-ms98-a-0017 81.664625 83.533500 yes
sw3404A-ms98-a-0018 83.533500 94.632125 it is i i enjoy it too and i have found a wonderful framer on Fifteenth Street down in Old Plano um about two doors down from uh Nooks and Crannies
sw3404A-ms98-a-0019 94.632125 108.198125 um who who does he's really an artist and he does a wonderful wonderful job with i just give him my things and he triple mats everything and he has really nice frames
sw3404A-ms98-a-0020 108.198125 118.330875 and i think when you it's very satisfying after you do something like that to have it framed and hang it up um it it's always that's kind of the fun part [vocalized-noise] 
sw3404A-ms98-a-0021 118.330875 130.717500 very reasonable i have brought something to Michaels and i was very disappointed in it and it was just a small little picture for my daughter's room in fact there were two little cross stitches i did for her room and um
sw3404A-ms98-a-0022 130.717500 145.438875 apparently two people framed them differently they two people took instead of one person doing doing the framing two people did it because the mats were just different sizes and to put them next to each other it just didn't look right and um
sw3404A-ms98-a-0023 145.438875 156.368500 he is so reasonable that um and he has all these unusual frames that he uses his name is um i guess i can just tell you his name it's Matt Inc
sw3404A-ms98-a-0024 156.368500 164.864375 and it's um i think the address is ten eleven and a half on Fifteenth because it's a skinny little door next to i think Bows and
sw3404A-ms98-a-0025 164.864375 165.919250 [noise]
sw3404A-ms98-a-0026 165.919250 175.387375 it's upstairs and this little skinny door it's right on Fifteenth Street right down right down by the railroad tracks his name is Dan [vocalized-noise] 
sw3404A-ms98-a-0027 175.387375 184.705500 yes closer to the right down down from Nooks and Crannies and it's Matte M A T T E Inc I N C period
sw3404A-ms98-a-0028 184.705500 199.128500 and um he does such a beautiful job i'll take something in i do simple cross stitches mostly samplers and a few that are a little bit more complicated but i don't really um with three kids running around it's it's hard for me to get something too intricate
sw3404A-ms98-a-0029 199.128500 212.738125 so i like something that's kind of quick and and i love i like doing the samplers i have a whole wall of them and he'll just take this sampler which is just you know mediocre not so great and when he puts the colors he picks out little bits of
sw3404A-ms98-a-0030 212.738125 222.454875 um colors that he'll pick from your from your work and and matte it with that little color and it just it just makes this wonderful piece of art um 
sw3404A-ms98-a-0031 222.454875 229.625625 so um i'm real real happy with them and they have some really nice books down there have you seen the books in the small shops in and um 
sw3404A-ms98-a-0032 229.625625 239.274875 on Fifteenth Street you know i'm f[airly]- fairly new to the area so i'm always glad to find a nice little shop that has different books but uh
