sw3498B-ms98-a-0009 63.651500 65.456125 of uh
sw3498B-ms98-a-0010 65.456125 74.341375 type of kids you know because it's starting to become new and and they're starting to find out more research about um this type of learning
sw3498B-ms98-a-0011 74.341375 76.085875 and so

sw3498B-ms98-a-0017 93.743250 102.026750 that's right it they're they hire teachers who aren't even qualified to teach those kind of kids and they burn out so fast they don't wanna teach them_1
sw3498B-ms98-a-0018 102.026750 116.068750 and there's not enough teachers who want to do that [noise] and they're starting to find out you know oh this kid [noise] may have a learning disability they test them_1 and find out that they do and then it's just a growing field because more and more kids are being tested into that
sw3498B-ms98-a-0019 116.068750 120.466250 [silence]

sw3498B-ms98-a-0025 143.549125 151.196875 you know one teacher can go out and learn how to teach but [noise] they only know one way and a kid might have [noise]
sw3498B-ms98-a-0026 151.196875 159.016000 problems you know learning that and comprehending well what does that mean i think it's i think more teachers should um
sw3498B-ms98-a-0027 159.016000 163.762125 find different ways and be creative on their teaching
sw3498B-ms98-a-0028 163.762125 164.837000 [silence]
sw3498B-ms98-a-0029 164.837000 166.164625 so

sw3498B-ms98-a-0035 197.378375 200.644000 the grading s[ystem]- grading system um
sw3498B-ms98-a-0036 200.644000 202.398500 well
sw3498B-ms98-a-0037 202.398500 205.663250 [silence]
sw3498B-ms98-a-0038 205.663250 213.299500 i think um well in a sense it's probably too easy but if it wasn't
sw3498B-ms98-a-0039 213.299500 222.538375 um these kids you know i mean nowadays a lot of kids they just you know don't try they don't get the grades that they could
sw3498B-ms98-a-0040 222.538375 224.380125 and um

sw3498B-ms98-a-0044 230.180250 232.260375 yeah i think
sw3498B-ms98-a-0045 232.260375 242.571125 well the field i wanna go into grades to me doesn't mean much it doesn't tell you how intelligent you are how bright you are you know um
sw3498B-ms98-a-0046 242.571125 256.886625 because i know somebody who's very bright and very intelligent but just doesn't get the grades and that's just because they have a learning disability um so yeah i think you have a good point there where they don't focus enough on them_1
sw3498B-ms98-a-0047 256.886625 262.227875 [vocalized-noise] how they learn and what they're learning you know not on the grade

sw3498B-ms98-a-0053 287.623250 297.698000 right and that's hard with a a large class you know with thirty kids you can't give them_1 all your full attention but and you know i i wish there was a way i'm not sure of it [noise]
