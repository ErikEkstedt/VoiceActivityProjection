sw3498A-ms98-a-0002 0.023750 9.635125 all right this is my opinion i i'm still a student right now and i'm actually studying in elementary education i think that there are quite a few problems with the school systems today 
sw3498A-ms98-a-0003 9.635125 18.103500 um more than anything i just believe that as students we're taught to learn what the teacher wants instead of actually um gaining a further vantage point
sw3498A-ms98-a-0004 18.103500 22.788000 and so it's basically we're taught to be mediocre in what we learn
sw3498A-ms98-a-0005 22.788000 32.344625 [silence]
sw3498A-ms98-a-0006 32.344625 33.765000 uh-huh

sw3498A-ms98-a-0011 62.628250 73.525125 [silence]
sw3498A-ms98-a-0012 73.525125 75.274875 um-hum
sw3498A-ms98-a-0013 75.274875 84.172250 yeah i think you're right i think that's really a a a really neat field i uh work right now in a special center for abused children and for some of the learning disabled
sw3498A-ms98-a-0014 84.172250 88.706250 and it's incredible how th[ey]- they can learn quickly if you just find what's right for them
sw3498A-ms98-a-0015 88.706250 94.622500 and i think like you said at least in my opinion i think they put a lot of restrictions on teachers of how they can teach them_1 you know
sw3498A-ms98-a-0016 94.622500 101.378625 [silence]
sw3498A-ms98-a-0017 101.378625 102.927250 um-hum

sw3498A-ms98-a-0019 115.697625 129.935375 i- i think it's really interesting too i think along with the special children i have a friend who is gifted and in school he did terrible h[is]- all his years because there was no one who ever challenged or whoever found what exactly was what he needed in terms of learning
sw3498A-ms98-a-0020 129.935375 135.503250 [noise] and i think again it kind of goes back to the same thing of you know being mediocre in everything that we do
sw3498A-ms98-a-0021 135.503250 148.000250 [silence]

sw3498A-ms98-a-0025 155.148625 163.169750 [silence]
sw3498A-ms98-a-0026 163.169750 165.568125 well i think you're absolutely correct
sw3498A-ms98-a-0027 165.568125 177.835875 you know i think personally like you said it it has [vocalized-noise] more to do with the teachers coming out of their shell and not being afraid to make mistakes and saying you know hey i'm i'm gonna try this If it works great if it doesn't i apologize
sw3498A-ms98-a-0028 177.835875 192.422125 and i i found [vocalized-noise] in my own schooling that when the teachers made that special effort to to make the class exciting to make it different to to challenge my intellect or to to bring about a different method of teaching i was a lot more interested in learning
sw3498A-ms98-a-0029 192.422125 193.784875 [silence]
sw3498A-ms98-a-0030 193.784875 197.222375 what do you think about the grading systems and and how those work

sw3498A-ms98-a-0039 226.712375 230.749875 do you think there's too much focus on grades grades instead of learning

sw3498A-ms98-a-0052 261.537250 266.172250 yeah and i think at least as me as a college student i have a really hard time because you know they [noise]
sw3498A-ms98-a-0053 266.172250 278.919625 when you go out for a job or whatever they're gonna focus on your grades and i think again that a lot of the school problems are more society problems where they're not looking at the individuals as m[uch]- much as they are just the whole overall picture
sw3498A-ms98-a-0054 278.919625 288.508000 and you know like you said i i like the point that you brought up that that you said really i[t]- it needs to be individualized and i think as that happens more that the schooling will become better
