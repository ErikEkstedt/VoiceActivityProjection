sw3447A-ms98-a-0003 10.052625 16.108625 a a year ago i changed jobs from being a researcher to doing marketing for the research group
sw3447A-ms98-a-0004 16.108625 19.134625 which means uh kind of a i guess it's a different
sw3447A-ms98-a-0005 19.134625 20.991250 set of standards i guess
sw3447A-ms98-a-0006 20.991250 27.819250 so uh i- i dress almost the same everyday i mean pretty much it's a white shirt and slacks and shoes and a coat
sw3447A-ms98-a-0007 27.819250 30.826250 but it was very different before how would you dress

sw3447A-ms98-a-0014 50.289000 55.258875 i [laughter-understand] that's funny [noise] so does it change
sw3447A-ms98-a-0015 55.258875 57.481750 y[our]- your dress no
sw3447A-ms98-a-0016 57.481750 67.825000 so or d[o]- i guess do you have things like presentations to do or anything like that [noise] so back in my old job up until through nineteen eighty i would
sw3447A-ms98-a-0017 67.825000 75.373750 usually wear blue jeans and pullover shirts and the like bu[t]- [vocalized-noise] probably once a month or so there was some reason that i would have to put on a suit
sw3447A-ms98-a-0018 75.373750 78.414500 pre[sentation]- customer presentation or something
sw3447A-ms98-a-0019 78.414500 83.857250 [silence]

sw3447A-ms98-a-0025 97.198250 107.375625 i[t]- it seems like TI is pretty cut and dried with the two like two or three levels that there's the t[op]- upper management that always wears gray suits
sw3447A-ms98-a-0026 107.375625 119.923500 and the people that don't uh i don't know if you noticed if i wanna say don't have power or don't have authority or whatever like i used to be in that research and i guess you are that we dress in the jeans and then there's kind of the
sw3447A-ms98-a-0027 119.923500 124.673750 the branch manager level or marketing people that kind of do that middle thing
sw3447A-ms98-a-0028 124.673750 128.773750 but there's not much it's nice that there's not a requirement
