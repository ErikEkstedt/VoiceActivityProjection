sw3406B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.023250 [noise] 
sw3406B-ms98-a-0002 0.023250 1.763500 okay 
sw3406B-ms98-a-0003 1.763500 6.635750 [silence]
sw3406B-ms98-a-0004 6.635750 16.231625 well i think it's it's probably a combination of things um factories that that burn coal as uh an energy source
sw3406B-ms98-a-0005 16.231625 22.995000 with uh sulfur and nitrogen contaminants you know and you get sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides
sw3406B-ms98-a-0006 22.995000 28.350125 uh those are the ones i think primarily contribute to acid rain and i think that's
sw3406B-ms98-a-0007 28.350125 36.946375 that's probably hurting us a little bit it's hurting you know other cou[ntries]- it's hurting Germany for example too and some other parts of Europe where they where they have high industry
sw3406B-ms98-a-0008 36.946375 40.355375 so we're not the lone ranger here [noise]
sw3406B-ms98-a-0009 40.355375 53.961625 [silence]
sw3406B-ms98-a-0010 53.961625 55.463750 yeah
sw3406B-ms98-a-0011 55.463750 56.478875 [silence]
sw3406B-ms98-a-0012 56.478875 61.444375 hopefully we're backing off from that a little bit but i know we haven't cured it yet by a long shot
sw3406B-ms98-a-0013 61.444375 69.460500 [silence]
sw3406B-ms98-a-0014 69.460500 70.878875 yeah
sw3406B-ms98-a-0015 70.878875 83.830875 [silence]
sw3406B-ms98-a-0016 83.830875 85.956125 yeah huh
sw3406B-ms98-a-0017 85.956125 88.378500 yeah i guess i missed that one uh
sw3406B-ms98-a-0018 88.378500 94.581750 automobiles of course are contributing too and you know h[ow]- how we are with our love affair with the auto
sw3406B-ms98-a-0019 94.581750 98.318000 kind of hard to do anything about that i guess
sw3406B-ms98-a-0020 98.318000 116.726125 [silence]
sw3406B-ms98-a-0021 116.726125 118.136875 yeah
sw3406B-ms98-a-0022 118.136875 129.322125 [noise] w[e]- we have that here too but it's part of the inspection sticker you know they put a probe in your exhaust pipe and and the computer reads whatever the ionization is coming out and
sw3406B-ms98-a-0023 129.322125 133.196875 so that's you know that's the way they're dealing with it here
sw3406B-ms98-a-0024 133.196875 139.450375 [silence]
sw3406B-ms98-a-0025 139.450375 140.619125 yeah
sw3406B-ms98-a-0026 140.619125 153.145875 [silence]
sw3406B-ms98-a-0027 153.145875 154.530500 yeah
sw3406B-ms98-a-0028 154.530500 156.962000 it probably be difficult anyway
sw3406B-ms98-a-0029 156.962000 163.996875 [silence]
sw3406B-ms98-a-0030 163.996875 169.533375 i was just reading an article in uh Mother Earth News Mother Earth News Magazine
sw3406B-ms98-a-0031 169.533375 179.552625 and uh they've got a new um you know a lot of places are burning wood a lot of lot of people are burning wood those of us who have i've got a place in the country and uh
sw3406B-ms98-a-0032 179.552625 191.270375 and uh they've had catalytic con[verters]- you know catalytic converters on those on uh i think they're required in California and Oregon and and Washington
sw3406B-ms98-a-0033 191.270375 202.702625 but they've had out those for quite a while and somebody's come up with a new one that uh sort of it's a it's a catalytic converter it's a c[atalytic]- it's a plate that fits in you know into the smoke pipe
sw3406B-ms98-a-0034 202.702625 210.840625 and uh apparently it sort of feeds itself the more smoke is produced uh the you know after you get to like five hundred degrees
sw3406B-ms98-a-0035 210.840625 215.068375 the the higher it gets so the the more complete the combustion is
sw3406B-ms98-a-0036 215.068375 223.415875 and it sounds real neat i haven't seen them_1 priced anywhere yet but that that sounds like that might help solve that problem even on you know old old uh
sw3406B-ms98-a-0037 223.415875 227.832750 older stoves that don't have any kind of EPA requirements on them_1
sw3406B-ms98-a-0038 227.832750 235.435000 that might help a little bit especially in some places we're really lucky here we have a prevailing southerly wind that blows just about everything out
sw3406B-ms98-a-0039 235.435000 241.919750 now sometimes we get a kind of a especially in in uh autumn it seems like we get a kind of a brown haze sitting on us
sw3406B-ms98-a-0040 241.919750 247.981125 but most of the time it's blowing out pretty well probably blowing up there to you guys [laughter]
sw3406B-ms98-a-0041 247.981125 254.985875 [silence]
sw3406B-ms98-a-0042 254.985875 257.555625 [laughter-yeah] it comes back
sw3406B-ms98-a-0043 257.555625 259.578125 [laughter]
sw3406B-ms98-a-0044 259.578125 260.632250 yeah
sw3406B-ms98-a-0045 260.632250 262.456750 i really think that um
sw3406B-ms98-a-0046 262.456750 271.112125 you know we're doing some some important things education uh raising consciousness awareness uh and i know school kids i work for school district here and uh
sw3406B-ms98-a-0047 271.112125 278.638375 you know this is one of the big things with kids kids are writing letters to the newspapers about you know uh telling [laughter-adults] to clean up their act and
sw3406B-ms98-a-0048 278.638375 280.437750 it's uh
sw3406B-ms98-a-0049 280.437750 284.337750 you know it [noise] hope we're not too late with it we're
sw3406B-ms98-a-0050 284.337750 285.409875 [silence]
sw3406B-ms98-a-0051 285.409875 288.841375 we're uh we're having all kinds of recycling
sw3406B-ms98-a-0052 288.841375 298.626000 [silence]
