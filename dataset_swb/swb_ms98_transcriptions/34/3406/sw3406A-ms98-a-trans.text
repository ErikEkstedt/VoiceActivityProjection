sw3406A-ms98-a-0023 98.173625 112.034000 i know uh in the Twin Cities area i just moved out of there and was kind of happy i timed it just right but they had a new policy where in order to get your uh your license uh your car license
sw3406A-ms98-a-0024 112.034000 117.812875 uh renewed you had to meet the pollution standards
sw3406A-ms98-a-0025 117.812875 119.777125 and uh
