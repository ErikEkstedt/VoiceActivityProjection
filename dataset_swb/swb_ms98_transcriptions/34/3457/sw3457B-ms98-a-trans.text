sw3457B-ms98-a-0004 8.106500 21.420250 [silence]
sw3457B-ms98-a-0005 21.420250 25.917125 well i think that's wonderful my children are in college
sw3457B-ms98-a-0006 25.917125 29.759500 but i teach school and i teach uh middle school age children
sw3457B-ms98-a-0007 29.759500 35.978500 and so i see a lot of uh variation in what happens when kids are at home
sw3457B-ms98-a-0008 35.978500 47.412250 uh i have taught school ever since my children were little but the advantage of teaching school is your hours are closer to your children's and your holidays are too so teaching i think is a 
sw3457B-ms98-a-0009 47.412250 53.440625 a good career to have and still be able to spend a lot of quality time with kids
sw3457B-ms98-a-0010 53.440625 56.115625 [silence]
sw3457B-ms98-a-0011 56.115625 57.386750 uh-huh
sw3457B-ms98-a-0012 57.386750 60.459250 [silence]
sw3457B-ms98-a-0013 60.459250 66.487500 right well with them_1 being as young it was much much harder when mine were young
sw3457B-ms98-a-0014 66.487500 73.269125 and uh i really didn't have that much of a choice because my husband was trying to finish his uh college work
sw3457B-ms98-a-0015 73.269125 80.129625 and his Master's degree and so forth and so it was a matter of somebody had to have a [laughter-full-time] [laughter-job]
sw3457B-ms98-a-0016 80.129625 86.994000 [silence]
sw3457B-ms98-a-0017 86.994000 88.637500 um-hum
sw3457B-ms98-a-0018 88.637500 95.933000 [silence]
sw3457B-ms98-a-0019 95.933000 97.778750 um-hum
sw3457B-ms98-a-0020 97.778750 106.160000 [silence]
sw3457B-ms98-a-0021 106.160000 109.545625 yes it certainly is we
sw3457B-ms98-a-0022 109.545625 112.456625 well i think that um
sw3457B-ms98-a-0023 112.456625 127.204750 we need to spend more family time together with with children today uh we made a point to spend a lot of quality time and the activities that we were involved in were the activities the kids were
sw3457B-ms98-a-0024 127.204750 139.710500 involved in you know like uh through scouting or you know anything like that we participated and uh we always made a point to have breakfast together and supper together now
sw3457B-ms98-a-0025 139.710500 142.549125 when yeah [laughter] when uh
sw3457B-ms98-a-0026 142.549125 148.397875 the kids were in high school it was harder to always have supper together but we did always have breakfast together
sw3457B-ms98-a-0027 148.397875 153.594625 so we we had supper together as much as possible but when it wasn't
sw3457B-ms98-a-0028 153.594625 156.372000 feasible you know we kind of kept a master calendar
sw3457B-ms98-a-0029 156.372000 164.469125 and when it wasn't feasible well that was understandable but uh we've always tried to spend time to talk and uh
sw3457B-ms98-a-0030 164.469125 170.174750 have some time together time and we sat around the table we didn't sit in front of a TV or
sw3457B-ms98-a-0031 170.174750 180.065500 that kind of thing so i think that's been important because_1 we do have a close family and even though the kids are basically uh grown uh
sw3457B-ms98-a-0032 180.065500 190.632750 they still like to sit down at the table and us all eat together when they're here and uh [vocalized-noise] have spoken before of they want that kind of s[ituation]-
sw3457B-ms98-a-0033 190.632750 195.958125 you know situation for them when you know and their children when they marry and have children
sw3457B-ms98-a-0034 195.958125 198.285500 um-hum
sw3457B-ms98-a-0035 198.285500 207.942500 that's right they model and the with the dysfunctional families today i'm sure you with a as a schoolteacher also you see what happens to these kids
sw3457B-ms98-a-0036 207.942500 217.759750 when these families never communicate or they're dysfunctional as far as the between uh oh second families or uh
sw3457B-ms98-a-0037 217.759750 228.508125 one parent families or all those kinds of problems that they have and then you see them m[agnified]- magnified in the children [vocalized-noise]
sw3457B-ms98-a-0038 228.508125 230.746000 oh boy yes
sw3457B-ms98-a-0039 230.746000 234.502875 [silence]
sw3457B-ms98-a-0040 234.502875 235.940750 um-hum
sw3457B-ms98-a-0041 235.940750 237.566625 yes
sw3457B-ms98-a-0042 237.566625 244.240375 [silence]
sw3457B-ms98-a-0043 244.240375 245.964750 it is
sw3457B-ms98-a-0044 245.964750 254.331375 it is and mo[st]- i think most teachers realize the value of quality time with children and i think we make a point to do that
sw3457B-ms98-a-0045 254.331375 265.229750 because we [laughter-see] [laughter-we] [laughter-see] [laughter-all] [laughter-the] [laughter-time] the outcome of not doing that and i think if we weren't so interested i[n]- in children in {childfaring} we wouldn't be teaching anyway
sw3457B-ms98-a-0046 265.229750 271.163500 so uh i wish we could reach more of the rest of the world [laughter]
sw3457B-ms98-a-0047 271.163500 280.097125 because_1 i think uh the major problems in education are not what's happening in the schools it's what's happening in the families and uh they expect us to
sw3457B-ms98-a-0048 280.097125 290.883625 you know have create miracles at school and fix all the problems and take over the roles of the parents as well as that of the teachers and you get to a point where it's completely impossible
sw3457B-ms98-a-0049 290.883625 293.545125 [silence]
sw3457B-ms98-a-0050 293.545125 299.522000 and you just get more and more frustrated and yet you feel for the the kids you do the best you can but
