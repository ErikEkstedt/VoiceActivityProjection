sw3435B-ms98-a-0010 22.915375 28.316500 [silence]
sw3435B-ms98-a-0011 28.316500 38.880625 uh well i mean i'm not a serious golfer at all uh uh a friend of mine goes golfing a lot and he drags me out every now and then and i uh i don't have a i don't really even have a game
sw3435B-ms98-a-0012 38.880625 43.950750 i usually when i go out and play golf it's usually like at a at one of these par threes that you know you
sw3435B-ms98-a-0013 43.950750 45.740875 but um
sw3435B-ms98-a-0014 45.740875 48.123125 i like watching it on TV
sw3435B-ms98-a-0015 48.123125 49.662750 [silence]
sw3435B-ms98-a-0016 49.662750 50.878875 uh
sw3435B-ms98-a-0017 50.878875 68.116375 [silence]
sw3435B-ms98-a-0018 68.116375 75.116000 well i i i if i can i can hit a great deal like um
sw3435B-ms98-a-0019 75.116000 87.043500 uh they they my friends to get me they they say i hit worm burners because i i can't hit it up in the [laughter-air] so i'm pretty bad but i i i get great distance hitting it you know uh for it going across the ground
sw3435B-ms98-a-0020 87.043500 95.299250 and if it's going over water or something one of them have to take the shot for me because i'm but i'm getting better i've got where now i can hit it in in the air some of the time
sw3435B-ms98-a-0021 95.299250 98.790875 yeah uh so i'm kind of a novice at it
sw3435B-ms98-a-0022 98.790875 117.039125 [silence]
sw3435B-ms98-a-0023 117.039125 131.712250 well that i i guess that's what i need to do is is get some kind of lessons or something because i my my tee off is not bad i mean i'm i'm good up to everything else putting and stuff like that it's just that that initial tee [laughter]
sw3435B-ms98-a-0024 131.712250 133.033125 [laughter]
sw3435B-ms98-a-0025 133.033125 140.386500 [silence]
sw3435B-ms98-a-0026 140.386500 153.468625 just walking around the hollow and making sure there's [vocalized-noise] not really you know checking the ground and and [vocalized-noise] so forth you know see how it's going to break or whatever 
sw3435B-ms98-a-0027 153.468625 157.387375 yeah if you get if you get down on the ground you really can
sw3435B-ms98-a-0028 157.387375 161.026250 [silence]
sw3435B-ms98-a-0029 161.026250 165.665875 um well if you know if it's up on a slope that you've got to hit it
sw3435B-ms98-a-0030 165.665875 174.968625 not kill it but you've got to hit enough speed and the right angle that it's it's you know because when it's going up a hill it's going to break in a direction
sw3435B-ms98-a-0031 174.968625 176.182625 yeah
sw3435B-ms98-a-0032 176.182625 185.755375 [silence]

sw3435B-ms98-a-0038 201.237750 208.107500 i'll go probably a hundred feet across the ground so it it takes me awhile to get to the hole but
sw3435B-ms98-a-0039 208.107500 209.639250 [silence]

sw3435B-ms98-a-0046 240.030875 242.187625 [silence]
