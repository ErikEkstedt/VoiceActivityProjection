sw3469A-ms98-a-0002 0.200750 2.564250 okay well what do you think about it
sw3469A-ms98-a-0003 2.564250 19.112750 [silence]
sw3469A-ms98-a-0004 19.112750 20.338750 um-hum
sw3469A-ms98-a-0005 20.338750 22.431375 [silence]
sw3469A-ms98-a-0006 22.431375 27.278125 that's intere[sting]- yeah i think that's uh i think it's a little crazy i worked with Spanish people
sw3469A-ms98-a-0007 27.278125 33.778875 for about two years and just it was incredible to me to see the things that they had to go through when they were really some of the best workers
sw3469A-ms98-a-0008 33.778875 37.585250 [silence]
sw3469A-ms98-a-0009 37.585250 38.628250 right
sw3469A-ms98-a-0010 38.628250 41.151500 [silence]
sw3469A-ms98-a-0011 41.151500 42.331375 [laughter]
sw3469A-ms98-a-0012 42.331375 44.002375 right exactly
sw3469A-ms98-a-0013 44.002375 46.180750 [silence]
sw3469A-ms98-a-0014 46.180750 52.144625 yeah i think you know i think in a lot of ways the law is good because it tries to to protect you know the people who are in the states
sw3469A-ms98-a-0015 52.144625 58.296250 [silence]
sw3469A-ms98-a-0016 58.296250 59.562000 uh-huh 
sw3469A-ms98-a-0017 59.562000 61.118500 [silence]
sw3469A-ms98-a-0018 61.118500 62.567000 oh you're kidding
sw3469A-ms98-a-0019 62.567000 63.615000 [silence]
sw3469A-ms98-a-0020 63.615000 65.047250 [laughter]
sw3469A-ms98-a-0021 65.047250 69.741500 sounds like a lot of fun yeah it's amazing to me how how many things they would allow
sw3469A-ms98-a-0022 69.741500 72.857625 to occur before you know you can come in and
sw3469A-ms98-a-0023 72.857625 74.404750 right
sw3469A-ms98-a-0024 74.404750 78.879375 yeah it's kind of frustrating too for those who are legitimate now you know i think
sw3469A-ms98-a-0025 78.879375 82.491625 [silence]
sw3469A-ms98-a-0026 82.491625 83.819000 uh-huh
sw3469A-ms98-a-0027 83.819000 87.468625 [silence]
sw3469A-ms98-a-0028 87.468625 88.696125 right exactly
sw3469A-ms98-a-0029 88.696125 95.704125 and i think it's important that they you know they allow a good number of people in every year because really they're the ones who work the hardest and do the jobs that that we don't want to do
sw3469A-ms98-a-0030 95.704125 104.410875 and i just i don't know i have personally i have a problem with it i think that you know if someone wants to come in and they can prove that they're going to work and they're going to be a good citizen that
sw3469A-ms98-a-0031 104.410875 106.579000 we shouldn't close our door
sw3469A-ms98-a-0032 106.579000 107.377250 [silence]
sw3469A-ms98-a-0033 107.377250 108.499875 yeah 
sw3469A-ms98-a-0034 108.499875 113.527875 and you know i i believe that if someone goes on welfare that's when you you know send them back to their country
sw3469A-ms98-a-0035 113.527875 120.155125 and i think a lot of times we're so busy trying to keep them_1 out that we're spending twice as much money as we would just allowing them_1 in and
sw3469A-ms98-a-0036 120.155125 126.240500 [silence]
sw3469A-ms98-a-0037 126.240500 135.235125 yeah and that's that's what i think you know i i have to laugh because like i said i worked with a lot of those and they'd been deported two or three times and just basically what they do is they get caught when they wanted to go home for Christmas
sw3469A-ms98-a-0038 135.235125 137.198125 or for any other time
sw3469A-ms98-a-0039 137.198125 138.720000 but
sw3469A-ms98-a-0040 138.720000 143.684750 i think you know i think all in all there's a lot of improvements i think the general idea is good but
sw3469A-ms98-a-0041 143.684750 146.308125 but there could be some work done in the area
sw3469A-ms98-a-0042 146.308125 148.587625 [silence]
sw3469A-ms98-a-0043 148.587625 150.595125 well good [laughter]
sw3469A-ms98-a-0044 150.595125 155.332375 anyway do you have anything else in the the subject uh that you might want to talk about
sw3469A-ms98-a-0045 155.332375 168.028875 [silence]
sw3469A-ms98-a-0046 168.028875 170.755375 yeah absolutely i think a lot of times we take
sw3469A-ms98-a-0047 170.755375 175.686875 you know basically who we want to because_1 if you if you have connections it's a lot easier to get in
sw3469A-ms98-a-0048 175.686875 181.024875 yeah and i think you know it should be more of a thing that's based upon someone's intent you know
sw3469A-ms98-a-0049 181.024875 190.425750 and that it should be equal to all and then not like the United States basically it's not who you know it d[oesn't]- it doesn't become a thing of who you know but but how the type of person you are
sw3469A-ms98-a-0050 190.425750 195.215750 and it should be based on those kinds of things so the good people like probably your husband can get [laughter-in]
sw3469A-ms98-a-0051 195.215750 197.225875 [silence]

sw3469A-ms98-a-0060 216.028375 218.060000 i've learned something from it
sw3469A-ms98-a-0061 218.060000 219.693625 [silence]
