sw3490A-ms98-a-0006 40.837625 48.195125 i i think they'd be better off trading him off for two million and a half dollar a year pitchers they can win some twelve games each
sw3490A-ms98-a-0007 48.195125 51.066250 [silence]

sw3490A-ms98-a-0009 53.389125 66.386125 [silence]
sw3490A-ms98-a-0010 66.386125 75.075750 i think you're right i i think that as long as they they keep that uh management team i don't think there is going to be a winner i agree with you
sw3490A-ms98-a-0011 75.075750 109.472625 [silence]
sw3490A-ms98-a-0012 109.472625 110.676625 yeah

sw3490A-ms98-a-0016 120.512000 124.125000 [silence]
sw3490A-ms98-a-0017 124.125000 129.958125 well uh well i i i don't either i i think uh you know th[e]- the whole
sw3490A-ms98-a-0018 129.958125 142.905250 pro sports have gotten out of control and watch watch a game on TV they got so many ads to pay for the thing if i can fall asleep during a football game wake up and not have missed a missed a down for crying out
sw3490A-ms98-a-0019 142.905250 151.448125 and that's the way baseball's going turn into it is they they have gone up to uh last year ninety seconds between innings instead of a minute and
sw3490A-ms98-a-0020 151.448125 165.997250 they keep escalating the salaries as they are i think they're going to wind up with as much you know advertising as they do uh playing ball and uh it's going to eventually kill the golden goose i i think i
sw3490A-ms98-a-0021 165.997250 176.642500 [silence]
sw3490A-ms98-a-0022 176.642500 180.155875 oh i i enjoy i enjoy them both i

sw3490A-ms98-a-0034 235.424625 241.482500 is is a major problem with the Rangers they make money and they don't uh as long as they make money
sw3490A-ms98-a-0035 241.482500 252.731625 and are respectable they don't make a you know they aren't going to pay the bucks out to be a winner and lose money and that's apparently what it takes [noise] what it what what it's taking right now
