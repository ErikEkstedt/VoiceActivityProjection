sw3490B-ms98-a-0004 4.732500 8.938625 uh well i just heard i guess uh
sw3490B-ms98-a-0005 8.938625 16.779250 big problem right now on the other side Duke's trying to sign Sierra you know but [noise] apparently he's gonna sign for twenty five at five is what they're saying
sw3490B-ms98-a-0006 16.779250 19.163500 [silence]

sw3490B-ms98-a-0009 22.025000 27.752000 i mean i don't know i think i think i'm worth twenty five million if he is but uh uh
sw3490B-ms98-a-0010 27.752000 29.449500 as far as
sw3490B-ms98-a-0011 29.449500 40.193500 i mean if they're going to pay Nolan Ryan four and a half million i mean yeah he's definitely worth it just because i mean Ryan's only got a couple good years left in it where Sierra's got at least another ten or fifteen years but
sw3490B-ms98-a-0012 40.193500 42.526250 i mean ye[ah]- that
sw3490B-ms98-a-0013 42.526250 45.587625 [silence]
sw3490B-ms98-a-0014 45.587625 52.501000 well uh the problem is you have Tom House who is going to he'll blow their arms out i mean
sw3490B-ms98-a-0015 52.501000 55.579000 and Sierra i mean those pitchers
sw3490B-ms98-a-0016 55.579000 66.902000 you got a uh they've got to resign them just to keep the credibility of this franchise i mean because if they don't resign them i mean that's pretty much going to be the last straw they've kept Val[entine]- Valentine way too long
sw3490B-ms98-a-0017 66.902000 74.768750 [silence]
sw3490B-ms98-a-0018 74.768750 84.487375 and it's you know i don't think i mean he's even said he he you know that probably will not not sign for as much as Bonilla did but i mean
sw3490B-ms98-a-0019 84.487375 92.994375 because apparently he's he uh he's real into um Arabian horses and one of the minority owners is a big time uh
sw3490B-ms98-a-0020 92.994375 102.212125 Arabian horse uh dealer or whatever and he's i guess there has been some he'd want he wants to stay out here and get some land and develop that because
sw3490B-ms98-a-0021 102.212125 110.610125 i was listening to a show the other night apparently he he doesn't want to he doesn't really have the stomach to go into a large market and have to prove himself all over again but
sw3490B-ms98-a-0022 110.610125 114.101000 he's got it made if he just stays there so he'll probably stay and
sw3490B-ms98-a-0023 114.101000 115.246500 [silence]
sw3490B-ms98-a-0024 115.246500 117.483875 oh i'll stay for a million but

sw3490B-ms98-a-0037 188.116000 194.738750 [silence]

sw3490B-ms98-a-0042 207.704250 214.812375 yeah the worst is when they they kick the ball off after uh when it's a commercial after they score a touchdown
sw3490B-ms98-a-0043 214.812375 217.936875 then then they kick it off
sw3490B-ms98-a-0044 217.936875 223.753750 then the commercial after that they bring them you know that's that's the one commercial i think they need to eliminate
