sw3492B-ms98-a-0058 275.416500 285.063375 yes and Navarro was terrific yeah they could use a a couple of really good tight ends they really they don't really have you know really you know super tight ends
sw3492B-ms98-a-0059 285.063375 291.553250 Navarro he was uh injured and i don't know then he came back and then they released him
