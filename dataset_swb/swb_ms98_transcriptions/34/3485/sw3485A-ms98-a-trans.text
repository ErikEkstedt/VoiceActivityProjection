sw3485A-ms98-a-0014 40.710500 43.042250 well it seems like [vocalized-noise] you know war[mer]- w[armer]-
sw3485A-ms98-a-0015 43.042250 48.084500 even in the winter you go from your warm car to your warm building so there really isn't that much of a
sw3485A-ms98-a-0016 48.084500 58.143375 of a difference or in the summer it's it's mostly air-conditioning course [noise] you do wear cooler things but i um don't work outside the home right now i have four little ones and so my
sw3485A-ms98-a-0017 58.143375 71.138875 my clothing doesn't need to be probably as fancy as yours [laughter] but um you know mostly during the day i wear the the casual type things and and i have the sweaters and the in the winter and fall and
sw3485A-ms98-a-0018 71.138875 83.034125 and cooler things in the summer but i for my husband he wears pretty standard all year round because it's so {climatized} his work situation but we just recently done something that we found
sw3485A-ms98-a-0019 83.034125 92.216375 really helpful with his wardrobe and that is um we send all of his shirts and his slacks to the dry cleaners and we hadn't been doing this previously i was
sw3485A-ms98-a-0020 92.216375 102.554250 you know washing them and ironing and taking care of them_1 at home and we found that it makes them_1 wear and look so much better to have just everything dry cleaned i don't know whether you
sw3485A-ms98-a-0021 102.554250 104.157000 [silence]
sw3485A-ms98-a-0022 104.157000 110.401000 well we uh figure it's pretty much worth the expense [laughter] just because um
sw3485A-ms98-a-0023 110.401000 116.423125 the the dry cleaner comes right to his place of work and picks the articles up and takes them_1
sw3485A-ms98-a-0024 116.423125 119.588875 and dry-cleans them_1 and brings them_1 back the next day and then they give
sw3485A-ms98-a-0025 119.588875 123.520625 the company a fifteen percent discount so it really
sw3485A-ms98-a-0026 123.520625 133.502375 it really is not that expensive and we figure you know what it saves on wear and tear and then and saving me having to do it and they look so much better when they're dry-cleaned
sw3485A-ms98-a-0027 133.502375 138.781625 than when i do so that it does it does and that's kind of a
sw3485A-ms98-a-0028 138.781625 144.981250 uh j[ust]- just a you know thing we've recently started that's that we found really helpful
sw3485A-ms98-a-0029 144.981250 146.763000 [silence]
sw3485A-ms98-a-0030 146.763000 157.645250 no he doesn't he he wears if he has an m[eeting]- a meeting or an important thing he wears a suit and tie but most of the time it's just dress slacks and and you know white shirt usually and a tie
