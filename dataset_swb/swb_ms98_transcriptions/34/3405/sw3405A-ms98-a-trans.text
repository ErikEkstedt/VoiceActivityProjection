sw3405A-ms98-a-0019 113.097875 120.935125 uh-huh well i'm a little more fortunate i think from that point of view i'm not allergic to things and i i moved here in State College
sw3405A-ms98-a-0020 120.935125 124.237750 quite a while ago and was fortunate to get some land so
sw3405A-ms98-a-0021 124.237750 130.581750 actually i have nine acres [laughter] and uh for many years i grew sweet corn
sw3405A-ms98-a-0022 130.581750 137.265000 uh and and my kids were there and so we set up a shop there and uh i would uh
sw3405A-ms98-a-0023 137.265000 147.647750 collect the corn very carefully ear by ear and it was never more than one to two hours old and people came from miles and miles around to get that corn because they knew it was individually picked
sw3405A-ms98-a-0024 147.647750 150.175000 and very very fresh
sw3405A-ms98-a-0025 150.175000 161.588375 so we had a nice thing going there and it was delicious [laughter] i really enjoyed that and then i also have a a garden oh it's probably uh
sw3405A-ms98-a-0026 161.588375 170.204750 twenty five by thirty or forty something like that that i put in my normal food garden things each year
sw3405A-ms98-a-0027 170.204750 175.137125 and uh i have a little bit of everything or a lot whole lot of everything in the actually

sw3405A-ms98-a-0029 181.083750 188.525875 all those good things and i rent out my field that i used to plant in sweet corn to a local farmer
sw3405A-ms98-a-0030 188.525875 195.990875 and then he plants about a quarter of an acre of sweet corn for me to use so i get out of that amount of work at any rate

sw3405A-ms98-a-0035 222.309250 229.703375 but that that worked out very nicely too i built him a barn back there where in the part of my corn field and he lived in that
sw3405A-ms98-a-0036 229.703375 235.391500 but uh as far as gardening is concerned we do enjoy it my wife is in charge of the flowers
