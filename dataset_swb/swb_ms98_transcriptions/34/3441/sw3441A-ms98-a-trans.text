sw3441A-ms98-a-0002 1.008625 5.231875 [silence]
sw3441A-ms98-a-0003 5.231875 12.821250 uh invasions of privacy um what most annoys me are all sorts of
sw3441A-ms98-a-0004 12.821250 16.293375 phone calls trying to to sell me things
sw3441A-ms98-a-0005 16.293375 19.576250 a[ll]- all sorts of hours calling and
sw3441A-ms98-a-0006 19.576250 24.940750 especially_1 with it being that i want investment advice that i want this service or that service or the other thing
sw3441A-ms98-a-0007 24.940750 30.611250 [silence]
sw3441A-ms98-a-0008 30.611250 32.078125 um
sw3441A-ms98-a-0009 32.078125 38.256375 my sense is that something may just have been done about it by congress and no[t]- clear
sw3441A-ms98-a-0010 38.256375 40.217750 just what went into the
sw3441A-ms98-a-0011 40.217750 46.254125 even the final will i think it does something about the random dialers that just dial phone numbers
sw3441A-ms98-a-0012 46.254125 49.728500 i guess in some cases they just consider pickup your
sw3441A-ms98-a-0013 49.728500 55.623875 your phone and and and not let you use your phone for a while whether you hang up on them or not
sw3441A-ms98-a-0014 55.623875 64.860750 um [noise] but i thought i saw something about having some kind of provision that people could specify that their phones were
sw3441A-ms98-a-0015 64.860750 77.848125 not for commercial use and and uh and uh people businesses would be prohibited uh from calling for pur[poses]- for purposes of of selling you things i'm sure that's true
sw3441A-ms98-a-0016 77.848125 84.218375 [silence]
sw3441A-ms98-a-0017 84.218375 89.938250 ah [vocalized-noise] something i probably should do too i thin[k]- i think government can do that now is that right
sw3441A-ms98-a-0018 89.938250 97.576625 and uh especially with with possibly children around um that could could be useful protection
sw3441A-ms98-a-0019 97.576625 103.409375 [silence]
sw3441A-ms98-a-0020 103.409375 105.218125 yeah uh
sw3441A-ms98-a-0021 105.218125 106.885875 [silence]
sw3441A-ms98-a-0022 106.885875 108.430125 i should do that
sw3441A-ms98-a-0023 108.430125 112.982875 [silence]
sw3441A-ms98-a-0024 112.982875 115.178625 what are dialing services
sw3441A-ms98-a-0025 115.178625 118.268250 [silence]

sw3441A-ms98-a-0028 125.449750 126.842875 um yes
sw3441A-ms98-a-0029 126.842875 133.167000 [vocalized-noise] what another problem that has been eliminated those problems used to be when i used a credit card
sw3441A-ms98-a-0030 133.167000 136.559125 they'd want to have my phone number
sw3441A-ms98-a-0031 136.559125 141.565250 and i did not like giving it ou[t]- or even give out my work number
sw3441A-ms98-a-0032 141.565250 144.633875 but i think i'm not sure if it's by law or jus[t]-
sw3441A-ms98-a-0033 144.633875 149.360000 otherwise i think the practice has basically been eliminated of asking for a phone number
sw3441A-ms98-a-0034 149.360000 154.328375 [silence]
sw3441A-ms98-a-0035 154.328375 156.334375 how did Radio Shack work
