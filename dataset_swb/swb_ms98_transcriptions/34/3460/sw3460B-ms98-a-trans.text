sw3460B-ms98-a-0002 0.570875 6.473500 [silence]
sw3460B-ms98-a-0003 6.473500 14.526250 um i was just now told that's what the topic was and um i guess invasion of privacy uh
sw3460B-ms98-a-0004 14.526250 18.904875 to me for example would be unauthorized use of credit cards
sw3460B-ms98-a-0005 18.904875 20.693625 for example
sw3460B-ms98-a-0006 20.693625 24.114250 and uh i guess recently
sw3460B-ms98-a-0007 24.114250 27.218125 one of the TV stations here uh
sw3460B-ms98-a-0008 27.218125 36.976125 ran a series of uh news casts on unauthorized credit card usage and how easy it was to get a person's credit card numbers
sw3460B-ms98-a-0009 36.976125 40.473625 and use it and i was quite surprised at that
sw3460B-ms98-a-0010 40.473625 45.534000 i guess i can consider myself fortunate that uh it never happened to me
sw3460B-ms98-a-0011 45.534000 48.379250 i don't know what i'd really do if it did
sw3460B-ms98-a-0012 48.379250 64.477000 [silence]
sw3460B-ms98-a-0013 64.477000 66.427500 um
sw3460B-ms98-a-0014 66.427500 74.771125 no not really because i'm listed in the phone book if i was the type of individual that uh had an unlisted number i- i think i would be hesitant to give it
sw3460B-ms98-a-0015 74.771125 83.001250 [silence]
sw3460B-ms98-a-0016 83.001250 89.589500 one of the things that upset me when i lived in California was uh they did a lot of things with your Social Security number
sw3460B-ms98-a-0017 89.589500 94.862000 as a matter of fact they even went to the point of printing your Social Security number on your driver's license
sw3460B-ms98-a-0018 94.862000 95.996500 [silence]
sw3460B-ms98-a-0019 95.996500 102.774750 and they would not cash checks unless they had your Social Security number so we had our Social Security numbers imprinted
sw3460B-ms98-a-0020 102.774750 104.488625 on our checks
sw3460B-ms98-a-0021 104.488625 105.565875 [silence]
sw3460B-ms98-a-0022 105.565875 111.036375 and i was really you know unhappy about that situation i think that was an invasion of privacy
sw3460B-ms98-a-0023 111.036375 128.332500 [silence]
sw3460B-ms98-a-0024 128.332500 129.479125 right

sw3460B-ms98-a-0026 130.508375 138.040250 one of the biggest things i think that's going on in this country right now is the selling of uh mail lists and things like that
sw3460B-ms98-a-0027 138.040250 144.142125 you know uh recently we uh i purchased some magazines US News

sw3460B-ms98-a-0031 157.944875 165.612500 uh even to the point of people calling me at home and prior to me ordering these magazines i never got those kind of calls
sw3460B-ms98-a-0032 165.612500 166.756125 [silence]
