sw3473A-ms98-a-0009 20.178125 26.486500 well i just got back from biking twelve and a half miles but this time of year you can't get much biking in uh
sw3473A-ms98-a-0010 26.486500 33.268000 but every morning i use this President's uh council of physical fitness and it really is
sw3473A-ms98-a-0011 33.268000 40.342500 uh uh it's worth doing and you can do it anywhere i- i travel quite a bit in my in my business and you can do it
sw3473A-ms98-a-0012 40.342500 50.319875 you know wherever you're at and if you do it i- i do it every morning after uh usually after breakfast before i take a shower and get you know dressed going you know to go to work
sw3473A-ms98-a-0013 50.319875 63.066625 and uh now what i do i mean i've done this for you know like fifteen years so you don't start at this kind of regiment you know i so what i'm telling you isn't something you go out and do and because_1 you'll hurt yourself [laughter]
sw3473A-ms98-a-0014 63.066625 71.447000 uh every every uh you know it takes me about fifteen minutes to do this now because_1 i do it all the time but i uh i do twenty five um
sw3473A-ms98-a-0015 71.447000 77.814375 uh what where you have your arms above your head and and your body twisters touch you know left and right toe
sw3473A-ms98-a-0016 77.814375 82.555875 then i do uh ten uh right and left uh trunk twisters
sw3473A-ms98-a-0017 82.555875 86.069750 and i do uh about sixty uh
sw3473A-ms98-a-0018 86.069750 90.287375 uh you know bicycle type uh leg thrust type things
sw3473A-ms98-a-0019 90.287375 97.177625 and i do uh twenty uh leg lifters on each side you know when you're pr[one]- laying on the floor
sw3473A-ms98-a-0020 97.177625 103.213000 and then i do fifty push-ups and do a hundred sit ups and uh then i do about uh
sw3473A-ms98-a-0021 103.213000 114.613500 oh yeah oh yeah and then uh thirty uh now if you did football li[ke]- like the old grass drills where you're on your stomach and you you know prone type things where you're kind of rocking on your stomach type thing
sw3473A-ms98-a-0022 114.613500 119.656875 but that takes about really about maybe about thirteen minutes uh you know in the morning to do it but
sw3473A-ms98-a-0023 119.656875 127.636875 [silence]
sw3473A-ms98-a-0024 127.636875 129.670875 well um
sw3473A-ms98-a-0025 129.670875 131.123625 [silence]
sw3473A-ms98-a-0026 131.123625 142.043625 years ago i used to uh referee football and uh to stay in condition i did that uh just as a normal basis and uh uh
sw3473A-ms98-a-0027 142.043625 146.217250 i tell you just by doing it uh well
sw3473A-ms98-a-0028 146.217250 152.276000 example this summer i- i was about fifteen pounds heavier than i wanted to be so i- i increased
sw3473A-ms98-a-0029 152.276000 161.699875 i do three hundred sit ups a day now but not at that in the morning i do a hundred then and then i do about a hundred before supper and about a hundred before i go to bed i lost fifteen pounds
sw3473A-ms98-a-0030 161.699875 174.407250 just by doing that because you tighten your stomach muscles and you can you know you can eat anything you want drink anything you want but you don't you know w[ithin]- within reason you know you can lose weight or maintain your weight and your ph[ysical]- your physical being and uh
sw3473A-ms98-a-0031 174.407250 179.091625 i just you know you're ready to go at a i- i- i think it's really important
sw3473A-ms98-a-0032 179.091625 180.665625 [silence]
sw3473A-ms98-a-0033 180.665625 181.763000 yeah
sw3473A-ms98-a-0034 181.763000 184.999750 [silence]
sw3473A-ms98-a-0035 184.999750 187.377375 [laughter]
sw3473A-ms98-a-0036 187.377375 189.727875 [silence]
sw3473A-ms98-a-0037 189.727875 198.779750 well well that's why Chuck i think uh if you did it on a daily basis and you didn't need elaborate things you know where you can make excuses like
sw3473A-ms98-a-0038 198.779750 206.993500 well i- i like biking and during summer i'll do you know at least seventy five miles a week and when i really was doing it maybe a hundred and fifty but you can't
sw3473A-ms98-a-0039 206.993500 211.260375 you know there's excuses the weather or you don't have time or something like that
sw3473A-ms98-a-0040 211.260375 219.643250 but if you do some basic exercises and you say every morning just like brushing your teeth you're gonna spend fifteen minutes or a half hour and you get up a half hour earlier
sw3473A-ms98-a-0041 219.643250 224.189625 and once you start getting into that one you just feel good and you look a whole lot better
sw3473A-ms98-a-0042 224.189625 226.453125 [silence]
sw3473A-ms98-a-0043 226.453125 238.260000 unfortunately not and there's no way i can get her to so it's a like it's something you either just really want to do it or [laughter] you can't talk anyone into it if you don't like to exercise you know it isn't going to happen but
sw3473A-ms98-a-0044 238.260000 247.060250 i- i sure wish she would she's you know unfortunately overweight and but she's a wonderful woman and you know no sense getting in arguments with h[er]- anybody about it
sw3473A-ms98-a-0045 247.060250 254.505250 [silence]
sw3473A-ms98-a-0046 254.505250 255.909875 [noise] well
sw3473A-ms98-a-0047 255.909875 258.186250 [silence]
sw3473A-ms98-a-0048 258.186250 267.079500 no problem at all and uh if you get one of these mats you know go to a store they normally have these exercise things these ABCs of physical fitness on them_1

sw3473A-ms98-a-0052 276.642250 278.385500 [silence]

sw3473A-ms98-a-0054 280.401625 282.269875 but but it doesn't
