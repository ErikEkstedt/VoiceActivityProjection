sw3410B-ms98-a-0022 132.663625 139.190250 like different on public figures yeah that [vocalized-noise] some of the stuff that they're they're like
sw3410B-ms98-a-0023 139.190250 148.364250 [vocalized-noise] like the tabloids and stuff are are saying that it's like really like i think Joan Collins i belie[ve]- i[s]- believe right now is having a lawsuit against

sw3410B-ms98-a-0028 175.762500 187.452625 infrared camera that can take pictures like with inside your house to see if you have any drugs or anything like that i think that's kind of an invasion of privacy too
