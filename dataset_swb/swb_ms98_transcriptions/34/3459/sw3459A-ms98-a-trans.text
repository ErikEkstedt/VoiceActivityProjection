sw3459A-ms98-a-0005 8.120375 14.440375 [silence]
sw3459A-ms98-a-0006 14.440375 17.441375 well now do you participate in all of that
sw3459A-ms98-a-0007 17.441375 19.480625 [silence]
sw3459A-ms98-a-0008 19.480625 25.754875 well i think that's i think that's great that she does that i i'll applaud that um 
sw3459A-ms98-a-0009 25.754875 37.219250 no and i i as a matter of fact i kind of cringed a little bit whenever i heard the topic because i think it's admirable and i think it's something that eventually we're we're all going to have to do it
sw3459A-ms98-a-0010 37.219250 40.903750 uh i don't but um i know the 
sw3459A-ms98-a-0011 40.903750 50.366875 [silence]
sw3459A-ms98-a-0012 50.366875 53.211375 uh in costs more in what way
sw3459A-ms98-a-0013 53.211375 66.995500 [silence]
sw3459A-ms98-a-0014 66.995500 76.979500 well that's interesting and i've you know i wouldn't i i mean i hadn't heard that Bob and that's that's a little surprising but you know i think about the amount of of newspaper that i throw away in a week
sw3459A-ms98-a-0015 76.979500 83.606375 and you know you multiply that with all the people uh i'm in Houston that are that are tossing out newspapers and it
sw3459A-ms98-a-0016 83.606375 94.374250 i remember i i was in New York several years ago and i took the wrong turn and i went over into uh State Island where the uh uh landfill is for New York City
sw3459A-ms98-a-0017 94.374250 108.256500 and of course that's not where i wanted to be so i turned around and beat it by hasty retreat but you know just the the amount of garbage that we generate uh is is staggering and i just i don't know how much longer we can continue to just dump everything
sw3459A-ms98-a-0018 108.256500 124.802750 [silence]
sw3459A-ms98-a-0019 124.802750 126.062875 yeah

sw3459A-ms98-a-0023 152.520500 165.568500 yeah and i can i can understand that i think i think about uh you know and uh they say that now uh a lot of the new cars for instance i read an article not long ago about this uh uh new Honda that they had come out 
sw3459A-ms98-a-0024 165.568500 178.952750 that they're identifying on the car those uh particular different parts uh uh that are plastic so that that whenever the car is worn out and dismantled uh they can recycle the the plastic components
sw3459A-ms98-a-0025 178.952750 189.551000 [silence]
sw3459A-ms98-a-0026 189.551000 190.882250 yeah
sw3459A-ms98-a-0027 190.882250 197.888375 [silence]
sw3459A-ms98-a-0028 197.888375 208.245125 it's just a matter right now of who's going to take the time uh to do it and i i mean it's something that i personally feel is it it's worthwhile i just uh
sw3459A-ms98-a-0029 208.245125 219.345125 i haven't gotten into it and uh i i think i'm probably like a lot of people in that uh until it gets to the point that it's kind of mandated
sw3459A-ms98-a-0030 219.345125 224.074750 uh i don't think i'm i'm going to do it unfortunately i know
sw3459A-ms98-a-0031 224.074750 225.721500 in Houston
sw3459A-ms98-a-0032 225.721500 245.913000 [silence]
sw3459A-ms98-a-0033 245.913000 255.683125 really i saw an article i mean a a program on a TBS not too long ago that uh [noise] they were talking about uh recycling and they uh
sw3459A-ms98-a-0034 255.683125 268.032125 were showing [noise] uh uh in a city i think it was Portland Oregon if i remember it was either but i[t]- it was either in Washington or Oregon and of course you know those people up there are very uh uh environmentally conscious 
sw3459A-ms98-a-0035 268.032125 276.714875 and they were uh talking about the the recycling effort up there and how they've got uh uh all these different bins and containers and
sw3459A-ms98-a-0036 276.714875 279.072000 really yeah
sw3459A-ms98-a-0037 279.072000 287.481750 [silence]
sw3459A-ms98-a-0038 287.481750 299.842000 i know [laughter] and you know and i'll tell you when you you know and i've been accustomed all my life to throwing everything in one bag and then uh dumping it in the dumpster it's going to be a rude awakening to have to uh start sorting everything
