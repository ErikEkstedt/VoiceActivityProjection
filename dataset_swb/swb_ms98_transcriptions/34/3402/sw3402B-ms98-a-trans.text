sw3402B-ms98-a-0003 4.205125 5.554000 right
sw3402B-ms98-a-0004 5.554000 7.718750 [silence]
sw3402B-ms98-a-0005 7.718750 9.495250 [laughter-that's]
sw3402B-ms98-a-0006 9.495250 10.917750 right
sw3402B-ms98-a-0007 10.917750 42.468625 [silence]
sw3402B-ms98-a-0008 42.468625 47.784750 well unlike you i don't i don't i like to read the paper but i basically don't do it every day
sw3402B-ms98-a-0009 47.784750 58.148000 and i um i usually watch uh either Good Morning America or the Today Show every morning while i'm you know whatever i'm doing an[d]- i watch that i usually watch the news either at
sw3402B-ms98-a-0010 58.148000 70.474625 you know early evening or at ten o'clock so i get it from TV a lot i get Time ma[gazine]- i read Time magazine um that's one i read pretty regularly and uh
sw3402B-ms98-a-0011 70.474625 73.425375 [silence]
sw3402B-ms98-a-0012 73.425375 86.797250 the thing about it you know now that i've fou[nd]- found is that we get such good coverage on TV or at least such i don't know attempted thoroughness of coverage by the time you get the Time Mag[azine]- Magazine there's nothing in it you don't know
sw3402B-ms98-a-0013 86.797250 95.324250 yeah i[f]- if you know then you can just sort of have pictures to go along with it or something because really i thought lately there's nothing new in the Time Magazine 
sw3402B-ms98-a-0014 95.324250 98.647125 you know it's it's basically you've heard everything
sw3402B-ms98-a-0015 98.647125 108.891375 and uh you might you might get a little more thorough uh account of something but really um i don't know i so i get most of mine from television
sw3402B-ms98-a-0016 108.891375 110.452500 i would say
sw3402B-ms98-a-0017 110.452500 163.496000 [silence]
sw3402B-ms98-a-0018 163.496000 175.919250 right and i i think there's an attempt to do that uh you know i think people there's a mild attempt for that but i think basically we basically associate news with bad news
sw3402B-ms98-a-0019 175.919250 189.819500 or or or catastrophes or problems or crises or uh you know i think our concept of news isn't isn't [laughter-necessarily] events that happen it's more negative like you said
sw3402B-ms98-a-0020 189.819500 199.504750 but i i think people try to on the on TV i think they try to throw in good stuff but it doesn't uh it doesn't sway the vote
sw3402B-ms98-a-0021 199.504750 228.685375 [silence]
sw3402B-ms98-a-0022 228.685375 229.974750 um-hum
sw3402B-ms98-a-0023 229.974750 245.186500 [silence]
sw3402B-ms98-a-0024 245.186500 246.517250 um-hum
sw3402B-ms98-a-0025 246.517250 260.925875 [silence]
sw3402B-ms98-a-0026 260.925875 268.805750 right [vocalized-noise] you know the war last winter was certainly a good example of that because_1 we saw every single thing practically
sw3402B-ms98-a-0027 268.805750 276.110875 [silence]
sw3402B-ms98-a-0028 276.110875 287.554250 i mean you know i remember well just the things that are covered i remember watching the World Series during the earthquake and just seeing that happen i mean you know that was just so phenomenal to see this stadium shake
sw3402B-ms98-a-0029 287.554250 295.233125 and the and the announcers you know grabbing i mean it's like that was just something because that was like live and real
sw3402B-ms98-a-0030 295.233125 299.170000 [noise] like you said and then of course one thing i think too is with tele[vision]-
