sw3416A-ms98-a-0048 264.444000 278.551375 other times why she could go in the in the barn with the pony and uh they got [laughter-along] [laughter-fine] [laughter] so they had their own great big house back there i have several other acres of ground that i normally planted corn 
sw3416A-ms98-a-0049 278.551375 288.332500 so i have a big enough building back there i had to build this new building to put the pony in the little one i built only lasted about two [laughter-years] [laughter-and] [laughter-so] he had to move into his new castle
sw3416A-ms98-a-0050 288.332500 298.466000 yes he had the works so i'm sure that uh Sandy had a a good life he was fed twice a day and had his own two acres to roam in and to graze and so forth
