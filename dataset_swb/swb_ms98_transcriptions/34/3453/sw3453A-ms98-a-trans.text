sw3453A-ms98-a-0009 32.447250 39.150250 yeah i'm the same way i was uh i had two Cadillacs i went to my first Lincoln this last time i travel and uh
sw3453A-ms98-a-0010 39.150250 41.005375 my grandfather
sw3453A-ms98-a-0011 41.005375 47.261750 worked for Ford Motor Company so he always said why don't you drive a Ford or don't you try a Lincoln so i finally tried one
sw3453A-ms98-a-0012 47.261750 49.735875 after fifty years and uh
sw3453A-ms98-a-0013 49.735875 56.149375 i've had i guess i guess four Cadillacs and and one Suburban in my last five cars but i bought a Lincoln and i like it

sw3453A-ms98-a-0019 74.987250 81.456125 well i'm a i'm a traveling salesman i travel on the road so i like a little heavier car so that's
sw3453A-ms98-a-0020 81.456125 83.245250 so that's why i
sw3453A-ms98-a-0021 83.245250 92.735250 choose you know to drive a heavier car and more luxury car but i tell you what i will probably get a Cadillac the next time quite honestly yeah because i like the Lincoln but
sw3453A-ms98-a-0022 92.735250 99.617125 there's just something about that Cadillac that whether it's a GMC product or whatever seems they handle better and
sw3453A-ms98-a-0023 99.617125 100.905500 [silence]
sw3453A-ms98-a-0024 100.905500 102.691750 i think so too

sw3453A-ms98-a-0028 127.325750 135.777250 you know i'm a i'm a funny duck that came that comes to the simple things like front end alignments i have never had to have a front end alignment on a Cadillac
sw3453A-ms98-a-0029 135.777250 144.213750 i don't know why why whether i just seem to drive them_1 better or what but i've never had to have a front end alignment on a Cadillac they always appear to hold well
sw3453A-ms98-a-0030 144.213750 148.084250 [silence]

sw3453A-ms98-a-0035 155.301000 158.483250 and the only thing i miss about a Cadillac is
sw3453A-ms98-a-0036 158.483250 167.483625 a Fleetwood Brougham was my last car and i traded it i[n]- traded it in on my Lincoln and they're just not as large as before i do miss that

sw3453A-ms98-a-0040 173.437375 181.637750 yeah it's big but the trunk space for me uh what i usually do is i usually take the backseat out of my car and that's where i put my samples because trunks just aren't big enough
sw3453A-ms98-a-0041 181.637750 189.223625 [silence]

sw3453A-ms98-a-0060 255.227750 263.279375 it handled real well but my main thing is space so if a Continental i might consider it the next time a Continental has more trunk space you bet
