sw3453B-ms98-a-0026 108.054500 113.542750 and i think that's one of the things that makes me shy away from uh imports
sw3453B-ms98-a-0027 113.542750 116.725250 is they put so much you know gadgetry
sw3453B-ms98-a-0028 116.725250 127.056625 on the dash and and the the buttons are so small to push and GM doesn't seem to do that i kind of like that feature
