sw3417A-ms98-a-0004 3.775500 6.024000 i guess my [noise]
sw3417A-ms98-a-0005 6.024000 8.068875 initial view is
sw3417A-ms98-a-0006 8.068875 15.244875 our tax burden hasn't gone down in recent years despite our total tax burden despite tax cuts but
sw3417A-ms98-a-0007 15.244875 18.905375 among industrialized nations we have one of the
sw3417A-ms98-a-0008 18.905375 29.862500 lowest in in the world and in part of the matter you get what you pay for we're gonna have national health insurance which seems likely it's necessarily gonna involve more taxes
sw3417A-ms98-a-0009 29.862500 41.716125 uh i suspect they take the view that cutting income tax rates has been good for the the economy that most other countries have a higher share of the tax burden
sw3417A-ms98-a-0010 41.716125 46.987875 in various kinds of sales taxes uh
sw3417A-ms98-a-0011 46.987875 56.558750 [noise] energy taxes particularly and that to the extent we need to raise more taxes that's the direction we should look

sw3417A-ms98-a-0017 85.805625 96.382500 well one one one of the big tax that has gone up a lot in this year is the social security tax which in principle is going in[to]- into a big trust fund but
sw3417A-ms98-a-0018 96.382500 104.116625 that is a particularly regressive tax uh it's a tax on the first dollar earnings
sw3417A-ms98-a-0019 104.116625 112.652875 an[d]- Senator Moynihan's uh proposal to to to cut there i think wou[ld]- makes a lot of sense
sw3417A-ms98-a-0020 112.652875 124.117250 i think Senator Moynihan's proposal to to cut the social security tax which isn't really going to going to beef up up up the social security program could make a lot of sense
sw3417A-ms98-a-0021 124.117250 135.065875 [silence]

sw3417A-ms98-a-0027 148.323000 158.733250 and other major countries are higher i had friends were amazed at the sales taxes the classes of things when they went to Canada [vocalized-noise] not so long ago

sw3417A-ms98-a-0029 160.733125 169.437250 and as a whole most other countries have a higher level of cradle to grave government services
sw3417A-ms98-a-0030 169.437250 173.596375 and it's a real real they're they're real trade-offs there
