sw3488A-ms98-a-0003 13.605000 21.165875 after having served on the jury and uh come to a decision
sw3488A-ms98-a-0004 21.165875 31.752250 uh an[d]- and really it was a case that was cut and dry the uh the defendant [noise] on uh the witness stand admitted he was guilty [noise]
sw3488A-ms98-a-0005 31.752250 40.250000 and then uh the first thing that was done was after um w[e]- we found him guilty
sw3488A-ms98-a-0006 40.250000 47.373875 his attorney jumped up and uh started going through the pro[cedure]- you know routine for filing an appeal
sw3488A-ms98-a-0007 47.373875 59.624750 [laughter-which] you know i i i know that that's the right uh but the defendant but i mean it makes you wonder why go through it one more time when you know he admitted he was guilty of the crime
sw3488A-ms98-a-0008 59.624750 64.365750 so um i don't know that it was a little bit disgruntling to me

sw3488A-ms98-a-0017 128.905250 134.001250 i agree with that and certainly um i think that uh [noise] i know that uh
sw3488A-ms98-a-0018 134.001250 144.161125 i have heard of people being you know in on a on a criminal case and uh saying that you know and i think you've got this option [noise] that if you want if you
sw3488A-ms98-a-0019 144.161125 152.223000 are found guilty by the jury that you can choose [vocalized-noise] even before the trial begins [noise] for the judge to sentence you

sw3488A-ms98-a-0030 235.879500 244.281000 [vocalized-noise] and and unfortunately those people who m[y]- in my book i would i would consider them to be terribly uninformed
sw3488A-ms98-a-0031 244.281000 255.860625 might be deemed the most eligible people [laughter-to] be put on the jury [noise] while l[ike]- like you said earlier i don't necessarily would [vocalized-noise] i don't [laughter-think] i'd consider them to be a jury of my peers
sw3488A-ms98-a-0032 255.860625 267.021625 you know so i but that's well you know one of the reasons why i hope i never have to be in a [laughter-position] [laughter-to] have a jury listen to what [noise] a case of mine and i hope i never you know am in that situation
