sw3489B-ms98-a-0015 122.552750 136.436875 so when i drive the car in the in the driveway in the afternoon it it'll just drive it up on a ramp that actually puts me on top of the the uh pressure side of a uh hydraulic cylinder
sw3489B-ms98-a-0016 136.436875 140.522750 and the weight of the car will crush what's ever in the disposer
sw3489B-ms98-a-0017 140.522750 144.309875 hope[fully]- hopefully it's not my wife [laughter]
sw3489B-ms98-a-0018 144.309875 146.475875 [silence]
sw3489B-ms98-a-0019 146.475875 154.821875 well i thought i'd you know i'd use it as a a escapement type thing i don't know if you're familiar with that operation but what you do is you just build up the pressure
sw3489B-ms98-a-0020 154.821875 160.702375 and then you go over and release it and then it just it just drops you know
sw3489B-ms98-a-0021 160.702375 161.931750 [silence]
sw3489B-ms98-a-0022 161.931750 163.651625 very similar yeah
sw3489B-ms98-a-0023 163.651625 168.857000 well what what it'll be you just you drive up on the jack but you it won't go down
sw3489B-ms98-a-0024 168.857000 171.088750 until you pull the pin yeah
sw3489B-ms98-a-0025 171.088750 172.559500 [noise] anyway
sw3489B-ms98-a-0026 172.559500 176.949000 i- [vocalized-noise] i have another uh recycling method i use
sw3489B-ms98-a-0027 176.949000 179.550625 you know all that junk mail you get
sw3489B-ms98-a-0028 179.550625 187.870625 the glossy paper that says buy this and send off for that and you have won and all that well anytime they send me a return envelope
sw3489B-ms98-a-0029 187.870625 194.855125 i put all that stuff back in the envelope plus the other stuff that i you know happen to gather up
sw3489B-ms98-a-0030 194.855125 205.429250 because_1 uh well like i say we live away and when you throw trash away you throw it in my yard and i don't like that so i don't do that so i take it and i send and i mail it back to them_1
sw3489B-ms98-a-0031 205.429250 209.326750 [noise] i've had four companies actually stop mailing me stuff
sw3489B-ms98-a-0032 209.326750 218.482625 [silence]
sw3489B-ms98-a-0033 218.482625 230.507625 yeah well i think one of the the best ways to eliminate uh or help the recycling problem is to eliminate non-reusable items
sw3489B-ms98-a-0034 230.507625 238.084250 for instance uh i saw a thing on uh Nova think was the other day this guy has designed 
sw3489B-ms98-a-0035 238.084250 245.552500 recyclable materials i mean recyclable items whatever he makes it's all out of the same thing
sw3489B-ms98-a-0036 245.552500 253.609125 see so if it's plastic it's all out of plastic if it's metal it's all out of metal it's he's a design he's a engineer designing stuff
sw3489B-ms98-a-0037 253.609125 254.647750 [silence]
sw3489B-ms98-a-0038 254.647750 259.860125 and in[corporating]- in[corporating]- in[corporating]- incorporating you know reusable materials into your
sw3489B-ms98-a-0039 259.860125 264.219875 uh you know your assembly line into your actual scheme of
sw3489B-ms98-a-0040 264.219875 274.441375 product operations is is the only way to really do it on a on a broad scale make it financially uh attractive to recycle and somebody will find a way to make money at it
sw3489B-ms98-a-0041 274.441375 275.646125 [silence]
sw3489B-ms98-a-0042 275.646125 278.327250 well there is a guy in Dallas that's all he does
sw3489B-ms98-a-0043 278.327250 280.268125 he collects trash
sw3489B-ms98-a-0044 280.268125 281.914000 you know
