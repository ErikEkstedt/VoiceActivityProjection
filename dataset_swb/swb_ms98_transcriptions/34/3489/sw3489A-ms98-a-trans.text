sw3489A-ms98-a-0002 8.487625 22.776500 right now we have a pretty nice recycling program where a lot of the recyclable materials can be picked up by the by the collection agency or the the city
sw3489A-ms98-a-0003 22.776500 34.799250 along with your garbage can uh you can put out newspaper you can put out glass you can put out aluminum cans you can put put out certain types of plastic material
sw3489A-ms98-a-0004 34.799250 44.434375 and that's on a roll out effort right now not all the citizens and the people in Plano can go ahead and uh participate right now but uh
sw3489A-ms98-a-0005 44.434375 55.302875 that will be rolled out to everyone i hope in the next year or so and those that aren't participating they have the specific drop off sites where you can take glass and newspaper and aluminum
sw3489A-ms98-a-0006 55.302875 65.003250 and i think uh overall that's an an excellent opportunity because_1 i hate to see our landfills being filled up and uh growing bigger and bigger and bigger
