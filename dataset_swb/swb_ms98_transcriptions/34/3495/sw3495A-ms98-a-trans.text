sw3495A-ms98-a-0003 3.168250 7.477125 well i'm in a i'm in an urban area i'm in Dallas
sw3495A-ms98-a-0004 7.477125 21.188000 and we're finding that crime is going up very quickly and has become a major problem uh even a more major problem uh in Dallas some of the major problems um
sw3495A-ms98-a-0005 21.188000 32.621125 drugs seems to be re[lated]- related to quite a bit of the crime we have now there is a lot of theft a lot of assault dealing with uh people trying to get money for drugs
sw3495A-ms98-a-0006 32.621125 37.744000 and uh i think that's a national problem though it's not unique
sw3495A-ms98-a-0007 37.744000 39.270625 [silence]

sw3495A-ms98-a-0012 48.686000 50.074375 [silence]
sw3495A-ms98-a-0013 50.074375 54.887875 right research triangle and all of that and um
sw3495A-ms98-a-0014 54.887875 60.491625 i'm sure you have a lot of students there uh and a lot of researchers so you you may have a
sw3495A-ms98-a-0015 60.491625 68.684625 you know perhaps a little better economic climate but in all your cities now it seems like th[ere]- there's a a crowd that's really effected by this bill
sw3495A-ms98-a-0016 68.684625 72.514250 [silence]
sw3495A-ms98-a-0017 72.514250 73.988625 really

sw3495A-ms98-a-0022 95.773500 101.114250 well here uh i'm not sure how many Dallas has had i've
sw3495A-ms98-a-0023 101.114250 108.469000 uh Houston is averaging about two a week or three or four i I don't know a a number every week
sw3495A-ms98-a-0024 108.469000 117.323250 uh Dallas is having quite a few it seems like most of ours are occurring in late at night or or like i say drug related
sw3495A-ms98-a-0025 117.323250 125.950125 uh i guess the other thing was that are causing a lot of the crime now is the decrease in values seems like a a lot of people
sw3495A-ms98-a-0026 125.950125 129.606000 don't hold human life quite as high as
sw3495A-ms98-a-0027 129.606000 132.204000 perhaps they used to
sw3495A-ms98-a-0028 132.204000 133.453500 [silence]
sw3495A-ms98-a-0029 133.453500 135.045625 um

sw3495A-ms98-a-0038 179.064500 184.439750 well now do you find that security is very good in in a in a town home

sw3495A-ms98-a-0045 208.579875 221.551375 [silence]
sw3495A-ms98-a-0046 221.551375 222.978750 yeah
sw3495A-ms98-a-0047 222.978750 224.511500 [silence]
sw3495A-ms98-a-0048 224.511500 233.976250 well i think you hit on one point there is you know each other i'm i'm in a neighborhood where we try to keep up with everything uh i am
sw3495A-ms98-a-0049 233.976250 241.462625 oh about three blocks off a major road and uh a couple of blocks off another road that kind of runs
sw3495A-ms98-a-0050 241.462625 254.651125 i guess you would say the neighborhood road it runs between the high school and the the commercial districts and uh i'm over the northeast part of Dallas and it's a in a nice neighborhood the houses here
sw3495A-ms98-a-0051 254.651125 262.430250 uh before the recession were running two hundred thousand or so and course everything's down ten to twenty percent now
sw3495A-ms98-a-0052 262.430250 263.904125 [silence]
sw3495A-ms98-a-0053 263.904125 272.104000 but we have uh one one thing that effects us is we have apartments that are probably about a half mile away
sw3495A-ms98-a-0054 272.104000 278.344250 and now that the economy is bad they have trouble keeping those full so they've dropped the uh
sw3495A-ms98-a-0055 278.344250 282.031625 uh they're not nearly as selective as they used to be
sw3495A-ms98-a-0056 282.031625 294.281500 and course that's kind of like a cancer in an apartment complex you start letting that happen and they go down and then before you know it you have drugs and a lot of other things so uh i'm sure that aggravates it also
sw3495A-ms98-a-0057 294.281500 299.074000 but unemployment now in Dallas or in Texas is up around six point
