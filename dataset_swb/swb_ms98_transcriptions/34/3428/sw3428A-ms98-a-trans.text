sw3428A-ms98-a-0002 0.047750 4.230500 okay on a scale of one to ten where do you stand and why 
sw3428A-ms98-a-0003 4.230500 45.999250 [silence]
sw3428A-ms98-a-0004 45.999250 47.521000 yes true
sw3428A-ms98-a-0005 47.521000 65.290375 [silence]
sw3428A-ms98-a-0006 65.290375 66.491000 right
sw3428A-ms98-a-0007 66.491000 79.184500 [silence]
sw3428A-ms98-a-0008 79.184500 86.750875 yeah i can i can understand that i was raised in Oklahoma and course being Oklahoman and Texan uh
sw3428A-ms98-a-0009 86.750875 95.600375 you know hu[nting]- the hunting and everything and i'm used to relatives and my father and my husband having guns and all and i i did
sw3428A-ms98-a-0010 95.600375 102.302500 used to be all in favor of it but it's all of a sudden it's starting to get really scary with these gangs
sw3428A-ms98-a-0011 102.302500 114.348000 yet i think i would vote a one if i thought that it would be nation wide and they can guarantee no one would have a gun no crooks nothing but because i know that's not gonna happen
sw3428A-ms98-a-0012 114.348000 119.554000 then i have to [laughter-i'm] probably right up there about_1 an eight [laughter]
sw3428A-ms98-a-0013 119.554000 136.536000 [silence]
sw3428A-ms98-a-0014 136.536000 144.236125 well i[t]- it just seems like in the past three or four years it has just gotten so much worse than it was there's always been a certain amount of crime in your
sw3428A-ms98-a-0015 144.236125 157.807625 you know your urban areas and i know we lived in Chicago for seven years and of course it was definitely there so when we first moved here it wasn't as bad as this it's you know it's just getting all of a sudden so much worse i don't know whether it's due to the drugs
sw3428A-ms98-a-0016 157.807625 167.364375 and the uh drug kings that are here an[d]- and uh Jamaican drug kings coming in i don't know whether that's it or street gangs i don't know
sw3428A-ms98-a-0017 167.364375 174.258000 what the answer is i know that it's scary and yet i hate the government constantly telling me what i can do and what i can't do
sw3428A-ms98-a-0018 174.258000 177.790500 and that's basically what the gun control would end up being
sw3428A-ms98-a-0019 177.790500 189.555875 [silence]
sw3428A-ms98-a-0020 189.555875 191.531750 well it's very true
sw3428A-ms98-a-0021 191.531750 201.464875 it's not the law-abiding citizen that you know is is dangerous with the gun [laughter] it's the ones that are going out and stealing it and i said i think the [vocalized-noise] only way i would be
sw3428A-ms98-a-0022 201.464875 213.693375 in big favor of gun control is if they could absolutely guarantee that nobody would have them and i think that would almost have to go with armies too i mean that has to be almost worldwide which we know would never ever happen
sw3428A-ms98-a-0023 213.693375 215.309500 [silence]
sw3428A-ms98-a-0024 215.309500 220.465250 because even if you said okay you know armed forces could have them_1
sw3428A-ms98-a-0025 220.465250 225.683750 some idiot would come out and sell it to somebody on the street to make a quick buck
sw3428A-ms98-a-0026 225.683750 226.733375 [silence]

sw3428A-ms98-a-0030 260.506250 264.256875 what about uh what do you think of this this uh
sw3428A-ms98-a-0031 264.256875 265.285625 [silence]
sw3428A-ms98-a-0032 265.285625 275.158625 law that they're putting into effect that you have to wait X number of days before you can uh carry the gun or buy you know actually purchase the gun
