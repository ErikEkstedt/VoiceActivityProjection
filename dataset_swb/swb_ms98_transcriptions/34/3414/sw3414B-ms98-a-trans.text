sw3414B-ms98-a-0007 15.908625 17.099000 i see
sw3414B-ms98-a-0008 17.099000 19.031000 [silence]
sw3414B-ms98-a-0009 19.031000 26.110500 yeah they do uh it started out several years ago when they put these uh collection sites
sw3414B-ms98-a-0010 26.110500 31.046125 they uh near a Wal-Mart near a the football stadium and the like
sw3414B-ms98-a-0011 31.046125 39.167000 and they just couldn't believe how many people were going out of their way to fill these things up these huge dumpsters were being filled up in a in a matter of a week
sw3414B-ms98-a-0012 39.167000 43.933625 so they knew that there was something going on here so they started looking into programs
sw3414B-ms98-a-0013 43.933625 52.888125 and what we have now it they changed the whole way that they do garbage in Plano instead of collecting plastic bags of garbage two days a week
sw3414B-ms98-a-0014 52.888125 57.877500 they make a collection on Monday for yard waste
sw3414B-ms98-a-0015 57.877500 63.331375 and the yard waste has to be put in the special bag that's a decomposable paper sack
sw3414B-ms98-a-0016 63.331375 67.435875 it's a pretty good size it's maybe the size of two or three
sw3414B-ms98-a-0017 67.435875 69.616250 um grocery bags
sw3414B-ms98-a-0018 69.616250 74.185375 and we put that out by the street and they collect those on Monday and then on Wednesday
sw3414B-ms98-a-0019 74.185375 87.939250 we put out two containers that they gave us one container's a huge green monstrous thing that a uh a special truck comes by and hooks onto the side of it and flips the container into the
sw3414B-ms98-a-0020 87.939250 91.521000 back of the garbage truck so and that's where you put your regular
sw3414B-ms98-a-0021 91.521000 93.678875 um garbage and trash
sw3414B-ms98-a-0022 93.678875 98.566875 and then also that same day you put out a small tub
sw3414B-ms98-a-0023 98.566875 102.963000 uh it's maybe two feet high and three feet by two feet wide
sw3414B-ms98-a-0024 102.963000 106.882750 and you put just throw in your aluminum and your milk jugs
sw3414B-ms98-a-0025 106.882750 109.321875 and newspaper and then they
sw3414B-ms98-a-0026 109.321875 110.523125 [silence]
sw3414B-ms98-a-0027 110.523125 118.323375 exactly they have a big truck that has like te[n]- uh not ten maybe five big doors on the side of it they throw the different stuff in the different doors
sw3414B-ms98-a-0028 118.323375 119.916250 [silence]
sw3414B-ms98-a-0029 119.916250 130.287500 yeah it is and apparently it's you know it it went off pretty much without a hitch the trucks the special five door trucks were a little tough in getting because of something to do with the Persian Gulf war
sw3414B-ms98-a-0030 130.287500 135.319625 tha[t]- the the trucks were being the engines or something were being shipped over there for something or other
sw3414B-ms98-a-0031 135.319625 137.414000 but it it does work pretty well
sw3414B-ms98-a-0032 137.414000 146.493250 [silence]
sw3414B-ms98-a-0033 146.493250 154.128750 oh yes uh-huh i noticed something interesting the last time i guess two Wednesdays ago when they were picking up i happened to be out there in the morning
sw3414B-ms98-a-0034 154.128750 164.588875 when they were picking up the that tub stuff and the man who was doing the separating when he was done emptying the tub he took a little electronic reader device off of his belt
sw3414B-ms98-a-0035 164.588875 168.805125 and he read the bar code that was on the side of the tub
sw3414B-ms98-a-0036 168.805125 173.889875 so they must be collecting information about who does it and how often
sw3414B-ms98-a-0037 173.889875 175.396625 [noise] yeah
sw3414B-ms98-a-0038 175.396625 177.337125 [silence]
sw3414B-ms98-a-0039 177.337125 178.645500 um-hum
sw3414B-ms98-a-0040 178.645500 180.690250 [silence]
sw3414B-ms98-a-0041 180.690250 184.042500 i i don't know but i think that's a really interesting question
sw3414B-ms98-a-0042 184.042500 186.357625 [silence]
sw3414B-ms98-a-0043 186.357625 189.919625 yeah that that seems far-fetched only because
sw3414B-ms98-a-0044 189.919625 200.815125 it i[t]- i[t]- there's no law that says you have to buy a newspaper or pop cans or milk jugs so there there's it's possible that there is a person in Plano that doesn't buy any of those three things
sw3414B-ms98-a-0045 200.815125 202.731375 and therefore wouldn't have
sw3414B-ms98-a-0046 202.731375 204.164500 [vocalized-noise]
sw3414B-ms98-a-0047 204.164500 208.461625 [silence]
sw3414B-ms98-a-0048 208.461625 209.989500 right
sw3414B-ms98-a-0049 209.989500 214.334000 [noise] no they won't take vegetable cans just just the aluminum pop cans
sw3414B-ms98-a-0050 214.334000 215.372250 yeah
sw3414B-ms98-a-0051 215.372250 219.347500 [silence]
sw3414B-ms98-a-0052 219.347500 221.416000 yeah what they're doing with that
sw3414B-ms98-a-0053 221.416000 224.149750 i would someday i'm sure we'll find [laughter-out]
sw3414B-ms98-a-0054 224.149750 225.457875 yeah
sw3414B-ms98-a-0055 225.457875 228.503125 [silence]
