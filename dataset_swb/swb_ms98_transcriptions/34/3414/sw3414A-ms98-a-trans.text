sw3414A-ms98-a-0005 16.392250 19.570625 but now Plano has quite an elaborate system don't they

sw3414A-ms98-a-0025 172.950375 178.061500 oh that is interesting does i wonder if that means that if you don't do it

sw3414A-ms98-a-0028 183.374875 188.061625 that that is interesting you know will you be penalized if you don't will you you know uh
sw3414A-ms98-a-0029 188.061625 193.570750 [silence]
sw3414A-ms98-a-0030 193.570750 195.457625 right right

sw3414A-ms98-a-0032 202.621250 211.475875 that's true except that it's hard to match and you know when you have uh cans you know from the the market and uh you know vegetable cans and et cetera and
sw3414A-ms98-a-0033 211.475875 218.735000 oh they don't take vegetable cans this is just their aluminum cans well then yes it is poss[ible]- that's interesting i wonder uh
sw3414A-ms98-a-0034 218.735000 220.049500 huh
sw3414A-ms98-a-0035 220.049500 222.073250 wouldn't you really like to know

sw3414A-ms98-a-0039 232.861000 236.423750 i think it's a very good thing i think that uh
sw3414A-ms98-a-0040 236.423750 240.493125 i think it helps that the city is giving you a nudge
sw3414A-ms98-a-0041 240.493125 251.619000 to do it because i think there are a lot of people that don't do it and i can't say that my husband and i are real real conscientious we got started on the aluminum cans because our uh
sw3414A-ms98-a-0042 251.619000 262.203875 grandson was collecting them_1 uh to raise money and uh stuff for an organization he was in so we start[ed]- collecting them_1 and now he's through so we['ve]- we've just we've kept on
sw3414A-ms98-a-0043 262.203875 267.495875 and it's interesting too that we have to drive we drive to Plano up Plano Road
sw3414A-ms98-a-0044 267.495875 271.276625 to uh just inside your city limits to
sw3414A-ms98-a-0045 271.276625 282.035125 you know turn them_1 in to dump them_1 in i sure there's bound to be some here in Richardson but we just haven't really seen them_1 advertised or you know something and
