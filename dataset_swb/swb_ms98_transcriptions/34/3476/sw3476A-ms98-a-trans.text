sw3476A-ms98-a-0004 4.242750 7.660875 i suppose so let me push the button
sw3476A-ms98-a-0005 7.660875 9.465750 [noise]
sw3476A-ms98-a-0006 9.465750 11.363375 okay
sw3476A-ms98-a-0007 11.363375 16.214375 [noise] um i guess i'm supposed to be all for switching to the metric system
sw3476A-ms98-a-0008 16.214375 20.083875 but uh i sense that it's not gonna happen anytime soon
sw3476A-ms98-a-0009 20.083875 26.544875 [silence]
sw3476A-ms98-a-0010 26.544875 27.805625 um-hum
sw3476A-ms98-a-0011 27.805625 31.000625 [silence]
sw3476A-ms98-a-0012 31.000625 32.440875 you're now in what
sw3476A-ms98-a-0013 32.440875 34.168000 acoustics ah
sw3476A-ms98-a-0014 34.168000 44.228000 [silence]
sw3476A-ms98-a-0015 44.228000 50.306125 well i guess that is the policy but it's been the policy for a long time and nothing ever happens uh
sw3476A-ms98-a-0016 50.306125 56.870750 i suppose things some things well happen slowly simply by having it taught in the schools more to the extent that that's happening
sw3476A-ms98-a-0017 56.870750 59.774375 having a new generation come up that's more used to it
sw3476A-ms98-a-0018 59.774375 63.031250 [silence]
sw3476A-ms98-a-0019 63.031250 65.305250 they have to for international trade
sw3476A-ms98-a-0020 65.305250 66.330375 [silence]
sw3476A-ms98-a-0021 66.330375 73.543250 but i g[uess]- guess it's it's easier to switch back and forth than it used to be
sw3476A-ms98-a-0022 73.543250 79.610250 uh be[cause]- be[cause]- because of of uh of computers coming into everything
sw3476A-ms98-a-0023 79.610250 96.575125 [silence]
sw3476A-ms98-a-0024 96.575125 103.643125 everyone wants a wants a conversion of that before put a recognizing it as a as as as as a concept to hold in mind
sw3476A-ms98-a-0025 103.643125 104.963500 um
sw3476A-ms98-a-0026 104.963500 106.956500 [silence]
sw3476A-ms98-a-0027 106.956500 114.037875 i- i- i don't see that it it it can change it very quickly i mean we're not the kind of society that [noise] that uh
sw3476A-ms98-a-0028 114.037875 118.998500 that something can be posed upon uh by government will
sw3476A-ms98-a-0029 118.998500 127.763375 [silence]
sw3476A-ms98-a-0030 127.763375 139.553000 uh the the the the public is just very conservative that way in in refusing to change measurement systems uh money dollar coins anything like that
sw3476A-ms98-a-0031 139.553000 141.753125 [silence]
sw3476A-ms98-a-0032 141.753125 146.052375 and and it and it it obviously makes no sense that we're practically
sw3476A-ms98-a-0033 146.052375 147.863000 alone in the world in
sw3476A-ms98-a-0034 147.863000 149.992000 in using the old system
sw3476A-ms98-a-0035 149.992000 175.884375 [silence]
sw3476A-ms98-a-0036 175.884375 179.618750 [noise] well i mean unfortunately i think
sw3476A-ms98-a-0037 179.618750 184.976625 people like you are relatively r[are]- rare who are coming up against this problem everyday
sw3476A-ms98-a-0038 184.976625 195.977500 [silence]
sw3476A-ms98-a-0039 195.977500 207.479375 [noise] uh i mean there there are things you could do uh we have signs up on the NIST campus here speed limit twenty five miles per hour forty kilometers per hour
sw3476A-ms98-a-0040 207.479375 210.806875 uh but that hasn't been adopted very widely
sw3476A-ms98-a-0041 210.806875 216.580500 [silence]

sw3476A-ms98-a-0044 221.748375 226.936500 but uh i mean and no one will will go a step further to remove the English signs
sw3476A-ms98-a-0045 226.936500 232.989750 [silence]
sw3476A-ms98-a-0046 232.989750 237.968000 uh you know or i mean you have highway signs saying speed limit um
sw3476A-ms98-a-0047 237.968000 239.755250 [silence]
sw3476A-ms98-a-0048 239.755250 242.666750 eighty eighty five whatever would be the appropriate number
sw3476A-ms98-a-0049 242.666750 243.772125 [silence]
sw3476A-ms98-a-0050 243.772125 256.129750 hundred car is going sixty two yeah so it would be more like uh like ninety i guess car is going fifty five uh you suddenly have a [laughter] have a even worse problem with speeding than we do now
sw3476A-ms98-a-0051 256.129750 261.506000 [silence]
sw3476A-ms98-a-0052 261.506000 265.202000 do [noise] do do you know where you are do the schools
sw3476A-ms98-a-0053 265.202000 267.824250 emphasize the metric system
sw3476A-ms98-a-0054 267.824250 269.467250 [silence]
sw3476A-ms98-a-0055 269.467250 272.733000 no i- i- i meant i meant down like in the elementary schools

sw3476A-ms98-a-0057 278.004625 279.375750 i mean i think

sw3476A-ms98-a-0059 285.872000 291.650625 yeah i mean i think my children learned the metric system but it doesn't get get emphasized over the other
