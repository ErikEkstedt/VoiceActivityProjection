sw3476B-ms98-a-0003 2.508500 5.067000 oh okay so it's right up your alley then
sw3476B-ms98-a-0004 5.067000 6.788375 [silence]
sw3476B-ms98-a-0005 6.788375 8.106750 all right
sw3476B-ms98-a-0006 8.106750 19.604250 [silence]
sw3476B-ms98-a-0007 19.604250 22.632250 yeah i don't think it's gonna happen either but i wish it were
sw3476B-ms98-a-0008 22.632250 30.836750 because_1 i'm a i got my bachelor's in mechanical engineering i'm at grad school now in acoustics and all we do is metric stuff
sw3476B-ms98-a-0009 30.836750 31.849625 [silence]
sw3476B-ms98-a-0010 31.849625 33.338875 acoustics
sw3476B-ms98-a-0011 33.338875 39.958250 yeah so everything's metric and then you go to read some old book or something and it's all confusing so i don't understand as much
sw3476B-ms98-a-0012 39.958250 43.513375 so i think we should get one adopted permanently
sw3476B-ms98-a-0013 43.513375 59.470500 [silence]
sw3476B-ms98-a-0014 59.470500 64.477625 yeah a lot of industry out there is doing metric stuff just because_1 they have to [vocalized-noise]
sw3476B-ms98-a-0015 64.477625 65.908875 yeah
sw3476B-ms98-a-0016 65.908875 79.370500 [silence]
sw3476B-ms98-a-0017 79.370500 80.738750 um-hum
sw3476B-ms98-a-0018 80.738750 89.811625 yeah i don't think switching back and forth is that big a deal i think people need to understand more like what a meter is instead of how many feet in a meter or something
sw3476B-ms98-a-0019 89.811625 92.188125 just get used to using all the terms
sw3476B-ms98-a-0020 92.188125 95.913625 because_1 someone says a kilogram no one knows what that is
sw3476B-ms98-a-0021 95.913625 103.159375 [silence]
sw3476B-ms98-a-0022 103.159375 104.421000 yeah

sw3476B-ms98-a-0024 118.884625 121.329625 yeah no one seems to be adopting it
sw3476B-ms98-a-0025 121.329625 126.534875 the metric system no one's very uh no one wants it at all seems like
sw3476B-ms98-a-0026 126.534875 138.483000 [silence]
sw3476B-ms98-a-0027 138.483000 139.905500 yeah [laughter]

sw3476B-ms98-a-0029 150.918750 156.958250 yeah i don't know it's pretty tough when you get everything confused though i think two systems is worse than one though [laughter]
sw3476B-ms98-a-0030 156.958250 158.841125 [silence]
sw3476B-ms98-a-0031 158.841125 163.832500 because_1 i know we do a lot of problems and things and they're half English and half metric and [noise]
sw3476B-ms98-a-0032 163.832500 168.985250 you you make more mistakes doing all the conversions than you would doing the problems
sw3476B-ms98-a-0033 168.985250 174.312125 i think they should just get one even if it's i prefer metric but even if it's just English they should at least have one
sw3476B-ms98-a-0034 174.312125 183.948250 [silence]
sw3476B-ms98-a-0035 183.948250 185.792750 [laughter] yeah

sw3476B-ms98-a-0037 186.899375 188.597750 yeah i think so
sw3476B-ms98-a-0038 188.597750 189.662375 [silence]
sw3476B-ms98-a-0039 189.662375 194.599375 because_1 your your average guy driving down the highway [vocalized-noise] wants to know how many miles it is to his destination

sw3476B-ms98-a-0043 210.258000 217.237000 yeah they have some of those in Ohio there's this one sign's kind of funny it says uh metric signs next hundred miles
sw3476B-ms98-a-0044 217.237000 218.961500 [laughter]
sw3476B-ms98-a-0045 218.961500 226.630625 [silence]
sw3476B-ms98-a-0046 226.630625 231.715125 yeah that'd force everybody to use it or to quit selling tape measures in inches
sw3476B-ms98-a-0047 231.715125 241.796875 [silence]
sw3476B-ms98-a-0048 241.796875 244.278500 yeah i guess a hundred's sixty two

sw3476B-ms98-a-0052 255.187500 258.110250 yeah you have a bunch of people trying to do ninety [laughter]

sw3476B-ms98-a-0054 267.404750 270.485500 yeah in the engineering they all do pretty much
sw3476B-ms98-a-0055 270.485500 272.043750 [silence]
sw3476B-ms98-a-0056 272.043750 276.357625 oh in the elementary schools i don't know i wouldn't think so
sw3476B-ms98-a-0057 276.357625 277.973125 [silence]
sw3476B-ms98-a-0058 277.973125 285.885375 i remember a ways back we did like conversions but we never actually went out and measured anything or did anything on one system
sw3476B-ms98-a-0059 285.885375 291.163125 [silence]
sw3476B-ms98-a-0060 291.163125 295.438000 yeah they learn how many centimeters are in an inch and that's about it
