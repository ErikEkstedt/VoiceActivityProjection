sw3494B-ms98-a-0029 143.891000 151.161750 but i also found out some more about it and i'm not sure i would enjoy it i don't know that i would really like you know fighting with a fish for
sw3494B-ms98-a-0030 151.161750 153.190875 hours y[ou]-

sw3494B-ms98-a-0035 163.224000 171.846625 in fact that's the most successful i have ever i mean as far as e[ver]- ever catching a big fish that's how i caught one with
sw3494B-ms98-a-0036 171.846625 178.570750 um a a bass it was a well see i can't remember if it weighed three and a half pounds or f[ive]-
sw3494B-ms98-a-0037 178.570750 180.842000 five pounds or
sw3494B-ms98-a-0038 180.842000 186.311875 i mean it was you know big i mean it was biggest fish i've ever caught in my life you know
sw3494B-ms98-a-0039 186.311875 194.376125 i was so excited you know [laughter-i] [laughter-was] [laughter-like] screaming my father was running you know he saw the fish go flying through the air a[nd]-
sw3494B-ms98-a-0040 194.376125 196.628750 that part of it was kind of
sw3494B-ms98-a-0041 196.628750 197.733000 i don't know
sw3494B-ms98-a-0042 197.733000 209.143250 i was fishing with a little light [reight/weight] weight rod and we'd been fishing down behind there's a place on the back side of this dam of this little lake that we it's a little private lake that we water ski on a lot and
sw3494B-ms98-a-0043 209.143250 215.350125 and they ha[ve]- have the water they let water drain off the back side of the dam through just kind of a
sw3494B-ms98-a-0044 215.350125 227.641625 i don't know it's some kind of a little drain shaft or something and and it makes a pool and then it goes on down the little creek that they dammed up to make the lake in the first place and they were there's a little pond kind of a
sw3494B-ms98-a-0045 227.641625 238.898375 pool of water there that is pretty turbulent and it's usually pretty good fishing and mom and dad were fishing in there and something kept eating my minnows you know and i was getting real ticked off because_1 i couldn't you know i wasn't catching anything
sw3494B-ms98-a-0046 238.898375 252.046750 so i crossed the little road that crosses the stream and went stomping down through the woods and where the creek runs on out there's a big old tree uprooted and laid over lengthwise in the water and i
sw3494B-ms98-a-0047 252.046750 258.053750 thought to myself you know i mean this creek is about five feet across max and i thought you know
sw3494B-ms98-a-0048 258.053750 268.937500 i bet you at the end of those roots there might be something and so i had my little you know i couldn't cast because_1 the tree's hanging over and brush and everything so i just kind of
sw3494B-ms98-a-0049 268.937500 274.581875 held the bobber in my hand and flipped it out there in in and amongst the tree roots
sw3494B-ms98-a-0050 274.581875 286.252375 and it kind of went around in a circle and then it kind of went right below the water and then it went around and then it just went whom a[ltogether]- out of sight altogether so i started reeling you know and it was stripping my line
sw3494B-ms98-a-0051 286.252375 300.066000 as i started going i realized i had something bigger than than i was equipped [laughter-for] because_1 i had one of these little ultra light you know kind of casting rods and i was like oh man so i was reeling for all i was worth and pulling you know pulling on the line w[ith]-
