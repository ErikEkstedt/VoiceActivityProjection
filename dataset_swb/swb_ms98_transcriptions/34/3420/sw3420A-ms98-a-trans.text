sw3420A-ms98-a-0006 18.738375 30.592250 three year old is in um a University of Gymnastics it's a a preschool and um i think it was really hard to um to pick the right uh
sw3420A-ms98-a-0007 30.592250 36.294750 day care or preschool or Mother's Day Out i guess you can classify them all together um
sw3420A-ms98-a-0008 36.294750 47.948625 some of the qualifications that i look for was that uh you know the cost and um exactly what they did if it was structured or nonstructured if they had a little academic
sw3420A-ms98-a-0009 47.948625 60.844750 um uh in there and um you know um you know what the qualifications the teachers' were and if the place was clean and um the hours and um
sw3420A-ms98-a-0010 60.844750 70.004500 just just kind of going by word of mouth and finding out if anybody else has been pleased with their program that kind of stuff
sw3420A-ms98-a-0011 70.004500 72.838750 [silence]
sw3420A-ms98-a-0012 72.838750 75.990625 oh well [laughter-congratulations] 
sw3420A-ms98-a-0013 75.990625 79.912625 [silence]
sw3420A-ms98-a-0014 79.912625 81.404625 right
sw3420A-ms98-a-0015 81.404625 87.424625 [silence]
sw3420A-ms98-a-0016 87.424625 89.322125 or staying home
sw3420A-ms98-a-0017 89.322125 93.447750 [silence]
sw3420A-ms98-a-0018 93.447750 94.888125 um-hum
sw3420A-ms98-a-0019 94.888125 96.286125 um-hum
sw3420A-ms98-a-0020 96.286125 99.729250 [silence]
sw3420A-ms98-a-0021 99.729250 112.955375 that's a very good place to start i think um-hum yeah the Mother's Day Out programs and that's where Shannon had started in a Mother's Day Out program and um the churches always have i think a uh pretty good program and
sw3420A-ms98-a-0022 112.955375 125.608875 you have to make sure that you um that you apply pretty early because they do have a lot of places have very long waiting lists and um and another question to ask is if they're um state certified
sw3420A-ms98-a-0023 125.608875 138.333750 um you know if the teachers have um their Master's degree in in child education and um child development um you know what what kind of a structure i[s]- is it going to be um
sw3420A-ms98-a-0024 138.333750 150.012500 when your child's a little bit older like a three year old you'd be more concerned with if there's a type of care that it's torture for them to lay down and take a nap is there like a mandatory nap time
sw3420A-ms98-a-0025 150.012500 163.362250 what they do at Shannon's school is have a video tape going and if and they lay on these little mats and if they fall asleep they kind of let them sleep and a teacher stays with the sleeping ones and the other ones get up and go do something else so
sw3420A-ms98-a-0026 163.362250 169.295250 she doesn't have to necessary take a nap there you know which is which is nice
sw3420A-ms98-a-0027 169.295250 171.604250 [noise] um
sw3420A-ms98-a-0028 171.604250 176.175625 [silence]
sw3420A-ms98-a-0029 176.175625 177.971625 that's true
sw3420A-ms98-a-0030 177.971625 182.940875 [silence]
sw3420A-ms98-a-0031 182.940875 189.731500 right and sometimes when the child's a lot younger before they're really um before three years old
sw3420A-ms98-a-0032 189.731500 200.023000 you know like the church is a good program and sometimes you even consider um you know having a private person come to your own home when they're real little or or something like that
sw3420A-ms98-a-0033 200.023000 210.294000 and another consideration is how many infants or children are they what's the ratio of of teachers to to children because that makes a um
sw3420A-ms98-a-0034 210.294000 221.755000 a difference and if your child would be maybe sleeping in that crib all day just your child and or do they just put any child in any crib and y[ou]- you know you'd want maybe
sw3420A-ms98-a-0035 221.755000 229.585875 your child to have their own sheets all the time and not have another child use that bed you know but i'm sure that um
sw3420A-ms98-a-0036 229.585875 236.538500 whatever you decide you'll be happy with and [laughter-and] it's exciting time to have a new one [laughter]
sw3420A-ms98-a-0037 236.538500 240.509000 i bet that's that's wonderful
sw3420A-ms98-a-0038 240.509000 243.628875 [silence]
sw3420A-ms98-a-0039 243.628875 245.093500 um-hum
sw3420A-ms98-a-0040 245.093500 247.919750 [silence]
sw3420A-ms98-a-0041 247.919750 250.335750 asking right
sw3420A-ms98-a-0042 250.335750 252.639500 [silence]
sw3420A-ms98-a-0043 252.639500 263.482500 some some places um start them as early as i think well some some places take them as infants i guess you know like eight weeks even
sw3420A-ms98-a-0044 263.482500 266.682375 um there's a place to look into um
sw3420A-ms98-a-0045 266.682375 276.494000 a nur[se]- a friend of mine who's a nurse is was telling about_1 a wonderful new place that opened some place in on Fifteenth Street up it's in Plano somewhere where
sw3420A-ms98-a-0046 276.494000 280.397500 um nurses that used to work in the hospital take care of infants
sw3420A-ms98-a-0047 280.397500 286.057750 infants and then only up to like two years old and it's it's supposed to be really a um
sw3420A-ms98-a-0048 286.057750 293.207125 you know some places just specialize in just real little ones and then other ones uh are the older children
sw3420A-ms98-a-0049 293.207125 299.522000 but it is a difficult situation i think and they're when they're little it's almost easier to leave them because when they're three and they're cry
