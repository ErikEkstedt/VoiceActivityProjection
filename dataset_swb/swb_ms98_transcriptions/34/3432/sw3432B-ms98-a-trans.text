sw3432B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.550750 [noise]
sw3432B-ms98-a-0002 0.550750 25.016375 [silence]
sw3432B-ms98-a-0003 25.016375 37.220875 well i'm i'm certainly for something too uh my husband and i've been self employed for about fifteen years and uh we pay like we're in our fifties and we pay like
sw3432B-ms98-a-0004 37.220875 44.285500 three hundred dollars a month but it's for nothing i mean the a it only pays if you're in the hospital
sw3432B-ms98-a-0005 44.285500 53.500875 so we pay our own uh you know out patient care our own prescriptions all that sort of thing which tha[t]- all that can run you know
sw3432B-ms98-a-0006 53.500875 57.866500 two or three thousand a year uh just with simple
sw3432B-ms98-a-0007 57.866500 70.633500 stuff and if we got the other kind that covered all this it would be six or seven hundred a month for the two of us see that's why we do it the way we do
sw3432B-ms98-a-0008 70.633500 77.254875 and you know it n[ow]- it goes up every year you know so the by the time
sw3432B-ms98-a-0009 77.254875 90.056500 we get close to Medicare i mean we've got a few more [laughter-years] it may be a thousand i look at medical care as being our biggest amount to pay out in retirement
sw3432B-ms98-a-0010 90.056500 94.494000 i mean more than a house payment more than anything else
sw3432B-ms98-a-0011 94.494000 96.428500 the way it is now
sw3432B-ms98-a-0012 96.428500 97.514250 [silence]
sw3432B-ms98-a-0013 97.514250 102.854500 so how are you covered with since you work part time
sw3432B-ms98-a-0014 102.854500 107.098375 [silence]
sw3432B-ms98-a-0015 107.098375 108.248875 uh-huh 
sw3432B-ms98-a-0016 108.248875 109.906500 [silence]

sw3432B-ms98-a-0018 110.987625 120.845500 [silence]
sw3432B-ms98-a-0019 120.845500 125.999250 uh-huh but yeah and you're probably what in your twenties
sw3432B-ms98-a-0020 125.999250 133.298125 yeah see you you don't n[ow]- it doesn't you know i[t's]- it's as you get older that this all
sw3432B-ms98-a-0021 133.298125 142.703250 gets higher and higher you know and and if you ever get anything bad wrong with you well not even bad just something mild uh
sw3432B-ms98-a-0022 142.703250 148.322750 then then you can't find anybody that will insure you you know if you're not with a big company
sw3432B-ms98-a-0023 148.322750 155.471125 and probably fifty sixty percent of the people in the United States probably aren't with a great big company
sw3432B-ms98-a-0024 155.471125 181.510250 [silence]
sw3432B-ms98-a-0025 181.510250 191.018750 uh-huh uh-huh and so many people if they're not with a big company now a days they just can't carry it um i have a brother who
sw3432B-ms98-a-0026 191.018750 199.334875 he and his wife had been with a big company and their they got [disfie[d]-/dissatisfied] -[dis]satisfied and left and decided they wanted to go in the restaurant business
sw3432B-ms98-a-0027 199.334875 211.422125 well when i saw him a few weeks ago i was horrified when i when he said they had no insurance he said we looked into it it's gonna be six or seven hundred dollars a month so we just couldn't afford it you know
sw3432B-ms98-a-0028 211.422125 212.995125 [silence]
sw3432B-ms98-a-0029 212.995125 224.207750 so yeah that's what they're doing taking the risk you know and they're supposed to be something like what thirty eight million people in the United States have no insurance
sw3432B-ms98-a-0030 224.207750 227.861375 well you can see why as high as it is
sw3432B-ms98-a-0031 227.861375 236.102625 [silence]
sw3432B-ms98-a-0032 236.102625 247.742250 uh well right now i i i can't think of anything else that course every everybody you know knows that the government gets into something then there's all this
sw3432B-ms98-a-0033 247.742250 258.328250 bureaucracy [laughter-and] [laughter-you] [laughter-know] all this money wasted in in uh uh implementing it i guess you'd say but i don't know
sw3432B-ms98-a-0034 258.328250 271.182875 what else you know it uh and i- i tried to listen to like other you know Canada has a national health program and i thin[k]- England has for years i think
sw3432B-ms98-a-0035 271.182875 283.012000 but again these are smaller countries and you don't always know if what will work for a smaller population country will work is affordable here i don't know
sw3432B-ms98-a-0036 283.012000 286.991500 i i just really you know wish they would
sw3432B-ms98-a-0037 286.991500 295.108000 look at every aspect of it and i'd i'd certainly be happy for it to be more of a uniform thing
sw3432B-ms98-a-0038 295.108000 299.458000 [silence]
