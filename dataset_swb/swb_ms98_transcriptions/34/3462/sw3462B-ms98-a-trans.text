sw3462B-ms98-a-0016 61.956625 67.333625 uh well it's kind of weird for me i'll tell you why first of all i used to be a Jet fan when i grew up
sw3462B-ms98-a-0017 67.333625 72.750625 i grew up on Long Island where the Jets play uh i mean they're in New York City but it's closer to Long Island
sw3462B-ms98-a-0018 72.750625 82.191500 uh then the Giants which were up in the Bronx uh but then around eighty five the Giants started playing really good defense and they started you know really not that i'm a fair weather fan
sw3462B-ms98-a-0019 82.191500 87.366250 but they really started looking good you know so now i root for both teams Jets and the Giants
sw3462B-ms98-a-0020 87.366250 91.197000 but i'm involved in this uh rotisserie league i don't know if you're familiar with those
sw3462B-ms98-a-0021 91.197000 94.038875 well you draft players from different teams
sw3462B-ms98-a-0022 94.038875 103.386625 so it's kind of you get points based on how many how many touch downs and and and and stuff like that that players on all different teams uh make
sw3462B-ms98-a-0023 103.386625 115.243250 so you get kind of caught up um [laughter] and now i got like you know players [noise] players on on like Buffalo and and Washington and and i- i happened to have uh your kicker
sw3462B-ms98-a-0024 115.243250 121.765875 and uh Micheal Irvin who was a great he's a great wide receiver and uh
sw3462B-ms98-a-0025 121.765875 132.720000 so my team's doing pretty good for for those guys i have i do have a couple of Giants um but they're [laughter-not] [laughter-doing] [laughter-that] [laughter-much] and uh i also have
sw3462B-ms98-a-0026 132.720000 141.153000 one Jet yeah they're not they're not looking too good um but you know it's always tough after you win a Super Bowl i guess and
sw3462B-ms98-a-0027 141.153000 142.432500 [silence]
sw3462B-ms98-a-0028 142.432500 148.843875 yeah and they they um they um i mean last year was just fantastic with the Giants winning the Super Bowl it was just

sw3462B-ms98-a-0031 162.049125 163.074750 [silence]

sw3462B-ms98-a-0043 192.139000 198.392000 yeah they got a big game this weekend i think if they win it they got a shot at getting into the play-offs but i don't think they're gonna win 
sw3462B-ms98-a-0044 198.392000 200.357000 they're playing the Eagles
sw3462B-ms98-a-0045 200.357000 202.414625 [silence]

sw3462B-ms98-a-0052 217.631000 223.887875 yeah i guess you got to pipe it off having the Giants uh win this weekend to knock out Philadelphia
sw3462B-ms98-a-0053 223.887875 225.341000 you know
sw3462B-ms98-a-0054 225.341000 226.942750 [silence]
sw3462B-ms98-a-0055 226.942750 238.687875 um-hum but uh yeah i think i think i think Dallas will make it i think that i think they're they're uh they're doing pretty well and i think that like if the season ended now they'd be in the play-offs so you just have to like win two out of the next three or something 
sw3462B-ms98-a-0056 238.687875 242.636375 [silence]
sw3462B-ms98-a-0057 242.636375 251.053375 really oh you never know i mean what's to you know Detroit's only one game up maybe they'll oh well they lost to Detroit already though didn't they this year yes so they can

sw3462B-ms98-a-0061 262.625250 274.023625 yeah i guess their quarterback on uh Detroit was hurt too they're all getting knocked down so maybe they have a better shot against this new quarterback because they haven't Detroit hasn't played as well with this guy as with
sw3462B-ms98-a-0062 274.023625 276.899000 um i don't know i think i think his name's Kramer
