sw3452B-ms98-a-0006 20.616750 21.799875 well
sw3452B-ms98-a-0007 21.799875 28.399375 well in my experience um i've never i've been fortunate enough to be able to stay home with my children
sw3452B-ms98-a-0008 28.399375 32.309875 but um i have given day care to other children
sw3452B-ms98-a-0009 32.309875 45.250000 and those that have come asking me to give you know to tend their children um i guess it depends on the parent whether they're looking for a preschool type situation where they want the children to learn
sw3452B-ms98-a-0010 45.250000 54.509625 you know different skills and um school type things or whether they're the children are younger and they just want somebody to be there loving and nurturing

sw3452B-ms98-a-0013 64.650125 69.443000 um [noise] in my opinion i w[ould]- i'm
sw3452B-ms98-a-0014 69.443000 81.434000 would feel that four at the very earliest i- i think that children need to learn how to get along with one another and to play and to be creative and and to

sw3452B-ms98-a-0018 92.063500 99.834375 i agree yes i agree in fact a lot of the kindergarten teachers that i've spoken with said that they would prefer that preschools
sw3452B-ms98-a-0019 99.834375 111.132750 per se would be done away with and that the children just had a chance to you know develop the social skills that they say the the kids that come to school that have been to the preschool type settings
sw3452B-ms98-a-0020 111.132750 115.991000 um are are almost far enough ahead that they're bored with school
sw3452B-ms98-a-0021 115.991000 121.131500 and they need to learn to get along but um have you ever had children in day care

sw3452B-ms98-a-0047 188.108750 193.164625 oh yes how many ooh that's been what probably twenty twenty years ago
sw3452B-ms98-a-0048 193.164625 194.972500 yes
sw3452B-ms98-a-0049 194.972500 196.373625 um-hum
sw3452B-ms98-a-0050 196.373625 201.790125 [silence]
sw3452B-ms98-a-0051 201.790125 203.185625 um-hum
sw3452B-ms98-a-0052 203.185625 214.106375 i think it is in fact i know that um around here one of the major problems that the working mothers have said they have is they will find a day care provider and then
sw3452B-ms98-a-0053 214.106375 222.907625 she will stick with it for oh you know five six months and then have something else come up and so then they are looking again for another one
sw3452B-ms98-a-0054 222.907625 231.610750 unless they go to the commercial day care providers and i know in the community i live in a lot of the mothers prefer just to have their children go to someone's home
sw3452B-ms98-a-0055 231.610750 234.068375 and i know that that's um
sw3452B-ms98-a-0056 234.068375 246.234500 there's a risk with that with the insurance and and different things like that but i know most of them_1 prefer to have their children just in a a mother and child home type environment
sw3452B-ms98-a-0057 246.234500 259.130375 so um i guess it just depends on what you're looking for and whether you mind if it was myself i would rather have my children in that type of environment rather than the the big commercial day cares just simply for the fact that
sw3452B-ms98-a-0058 259.130375 267.362375 there's so much illness that the little ones pass around and and y[ou]- you know that type of a thing and the um
sw3452B-ms98-a-0059 267.362375 278.972875 and i don't know what the one to one or you know what the ratio is for the adult providers and the children but i would think that if you had a small group it would be
sw3452B-ms98-a-0060 278.972875 282.484500 that would be my preference anyway so
sw3452B-ms98-a-0061 282.484500 284.973000 [silence]
sw3452B-ms98-a-0062 284.973000 286.819625 oh
