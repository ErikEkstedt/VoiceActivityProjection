sw3452A-ms98-a-0002 0.093375 9.918125 all right Sandra uh what we are supposed to talk about this morning are and i- i can tell that you're must be an expert child care services
sw3452A-ms98-a-0003 9.918125 13.180125 and my my first question is
sw3452A-ms98-a-0004 13.180125 15.695375 what criteria
sw3452A-ms98-a-0005 15.695375 20.188000 is normally applied by parents when they are selecting child care
sw3452A-ms98-a-0006 20.188000 22.603875 what are they looking for in other words
sw3452A-ms98-a-0007 22.603875 48.049250 [silence]
sw3452A-ms98-a-0008 48.049250 49.468625 um-hum
sw3452A-ms98-a-0009 49.468625 54.506750 [silence]
sw3452A-ms98-a-0010 54.506750 65.598625 what age would you say uh a child should be before you could start applying this business of teaching them_1 a little bit preschool information we tal[king]- what six or seven or four or five
sw3452A-ms98-a-0011 65.598625 72.599000 [silence]
sw3452A-ms98-a-0012 72.599000 73.982250 uh-huh
sw3452A-ms98-a-0013 73.982250 80.025500 [silence]
sw3452A-ms98-a-0014 80.025500 92.870750 they do seem to have a very much improved uh intellectual sort of a spirit they're bright they look around and and they they know what's going that's that i guess that's as important to say
sw3452A-ms98-a-0015 92.870750 94.171375 yeah
sw3452A-ms98-a-0016 94.171375 106.235625 [silence]
sw3452A-ms98-a-0017 106.235625 107.545375 um-hum
sw3452A-ms98-a-0018 107.545375 115.265375 [silence]
sw3452A-ms98-a-0019 115.265375 116.744500 yeah
sw3452A-ms98-a-0020 116.744500 121.767375 [silence]
sw3452A-ms98-a-0021 121.767375 136.440125 i'm trying to think uh yes we've had uh our children in day care a little bit but not much i [vocalized-noise] the interesting comment i was going to make was that when my children grew up i felt very normal and uh
sw3452A-ms98-a-0022 136.440125 141.099625 with them and i didn't consider a lot of these little details that we're talking about
sw3452A-ms98-a-0023 141.099625 147.710875 but now that my grandchildren are growing up i look at them in a totally different s[tyle]- style
sw3452A-ms98-a-0024 147.710875 159.082125 i- i watch very closely their activities when i see them and like and i can tell when they're speaking more clearly the next day and and when they are understanding situations [laughter-more] carefully
sw3452A-ms98-a-0025 159.082125 168.279875 and i- i don't remember doing it maybe i did automatically with my own children but i'm i'm just looking with a much higher technical detail at at the grandchildren
sw3452A-ms98-a-0026 168.279875 169.922125 [silence]
sw3452A-ms98-a-0027 169.922125 174.136125 well i wish i did i'm still working but i'll be retiring soon
sw3452A-ms98-a-0028 174.136125 181.997875 it it's it's just that uh with grandchildren they are for a short period of time and you just look at them and you absorb anything you can from them_1 and uh
sw3452A-ms98-a-0029 181.997875 186.762750 you start re[viewing]- comparing when you get from them with what you got from your own children
sw3452A-ms98-a-0030 186.762750 189.153250 but it was really a different environment
sw3452A-ms98-a-0031 189.153250 190.697250 [laughter]
sw3452A-ms98-a-0032 190.697250 192.316500 [silence]
sw3452A-ms98-a-0033 192.316500 194.070750 something like that
sw3452A-ms98-a-0034 194.070750 203.697500 well let me ask you this is it difficult to find a day care when you have a a specific criteria of your own is that is that hard to find
sw3452A-ms98-a-0035 203.697500 243.494750 [silence]
sw3452A-ms98-a-0036 243.494750 245.391875 i see uh-huh
sw3452A-ms98-a-0037 245.391875 246.724000 um-hum

sw3452A-ms98-a-0040 263.784125 272.020500 [silence]

sw3452A-ms98-a-0042 273.333750 281.441875 [silence]
sw3452A-ms98-a-0043 281.441875 285.800500 we[ll]- my my daughter my oldest daughter lives in Amsterdam Holland
