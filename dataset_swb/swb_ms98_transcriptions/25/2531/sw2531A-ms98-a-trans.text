sw2531A-ms98-a-0012 40.285500 49.317875 i mean it's it's kind of sad when you have to give them more than one life sentence in order to insure that they're going to stay in for a while i mean you know
sw2531A-ms98-a-0013 49.317875 51.244125 even that's wh[at]-

sw2531A-ms98-a-0021 75.823875 77.057250 [noise] right
sw2531A-ms98-a-0022 77.057250 89.045000 right no yeah they do need to to drastically do something uh about the whole works because uh it's obvious especially with the introduction of drugs now that crime is is there's
sw2531A-ms98-a-0023 89.045000 96.177000 it's in such the uprise i mean there's so much more of it now than there was even fifteen years ago

sw2531A-ms98-a-0040 159.827125 170.081250 i yeah i know uh that is too simple well people keep saying well what if they you know but uh they're uh look at how long people sit on death row
sw2531A-ms98-a-0041 170.081250 175.578875 before they even do i mean they've been assigned the death [laughter-penalty] and they don't even do it you know

sw2531A-ms98-a-0049 199.053750 207.563875 yes loo[k]- i mean that has to be one of the biggest wasters of money is the years that these guys sit on death row i mean
sw2531A-ms98-a-0050 207.563875 214.926875 [silence]
sw2531A-ms98-a-0051 214.926875 217.984750 [laughter-oh] [laughter-no] i mean look at them
sw2531A-ms98-a-0052 217.984750 221.185125 [silence]
sw2531A-ms98-a-0053 221.185125 230.787500 oh yeah they're you know they say that they can't uh inflict cr[uel]- cruel and unusual punishment but boy what is that knowing that any day the shoe could drop [laughter-i] [laughter-mean] yeah uh-huh
sw2531A-ms98-a-0054 230.787500 237.524000 i mean nine years that's incredible oh i don't know what the average is uh uh for
sw2531A-ms98-a-0055 237.524000 240.607625 eight is the average wow
sw2531A-ms98-a-0056 240.607625 252.007875 hum-um it should be never it should that should have a cutoff time just like uh uh statutes of limits and ever[ything]- all that other stuff you know they they should have like within one year
sw2531A-ms98-a-0057 252.007875 261.944375 so that they'd have enough time for an appeal and uh you know get that stuff out of the way and if it's turned down th[e]- the you know after that if if two people have said it then two is enough
sw2531A-ms98-a-0058 261.944375 262.240500 [laughter]
sw2531A-ms98-a-0059 262.240500 265.628500 they shouldn't even allow the lawyers to go any further
sw2531A-ms98-a-0060 265.628500 271.405875 i think they're kind of bending the law ju[st]- they just want more money is what it is i'm sorry
sw2531A-ms98-a-0061 271.405875 272.684375 yeah
sw2531A-ms98-a-0062 272.684375 273.978000 [silence]
sw2531A-ms98-a-0063 273.978000 282.282750 well uh that's kind of obvious i mean they're even carrying it to to where now uh that they advertise on TV you know
sw2531A-ms98-a-0064 282.282750 296.744500 if your if you uh you know have done this or if you need this uh uh we'll sue for you and you don't have to pay us unless you but then what they don't tell you is that if you if they win you give them at least a third of the of [laughter-the] thing that they win
sw2531A-ms98-a-0065 296.744500 309.527375 so [noise] i don't know it is uh it's getting to be more business now rather than uh actually uh dealing with the crime than with uh um
sw2531A-ms98-a-0066 309.527375 310.532875 [silence]
sw2531A-ms98-a-0067 310.532875 322.914500 the uh punishment they th[e]- the lawyers are just in it for the money [laughter] i'm i'm convinced i know i- i agree with you i think you're real you're very right that the politicians should i think they should
sw2531A-ms98-a-0068 322.914500 336.390500 have an equal amount of you know maybe they can have a few but i think most of them should be not uh lawyers in the fact and that's way way they've gotten into politics [laughter-it's] because of the the law things you know the loops and everything
sw2531A-ms98-a-0069 336.390500 338.068250 but uh
sw2531A-ms98-a-0070 338.068250 352.332750 but no i know we it um we're in Maryland and uh we have the same thing overcrowding and and uh they are letting them out i mean just the regular jail sentence thing they let them out because of they don't have any place to kee[p]- to put them_1
sw2531A-ms98-a-0071 352.332750 366.031625 so somebody that could you know uh unless uh been a major offense but uh uh even the {piddly} little stuff i mean the the guys that loses today in America is the victim
sw2531A-ms98-a-0072 366.031625 372.272000 and whoever that may be whether it's a robbery or drugs or whatever else um
sw2531A-ms98-a-0073 372.272000 377.257625 they are the ones that are going to pay and they are the one that are going to suffer
sw2531A-ms98-a-0074 377.257625 381.719375 and the other person you know if they p[ay]- if they if they
sw2531A-ms98-a-0075 381.719375 395.230875 uh arrest them uh and uh then the you know time the law takes over uh half the time uh they either let them go or they get off with a a sentence because they've had a lawyer that
sw2531A-ms98-a-0076 395.230875 397.089000 you know feels that
sw2531A-ms98-a-0077 397.089000 400.396125 that they weren't all together when they did it [laughter]
sw2531A-ms98-a-0078 400.396125 416.621875 [silence]
sw2531A-ms98-a-0079 416.621875 426.429250 right although you know uh [laughter] that uh it's kind of a catch twenty two because if you defend yourself or as there was a case where this
sw2531A-ms98-a-0080 426.429250 438.605875 uh fellow in Baltimore kept having his store broken into uh through a vent in the cei[ling]- in the ceiling uh the roof so he put an electric grate there well somebody tried to break in 
sw2531A-ms98-a-0081 438.605875 443.590375 got stuck and was electrocuted and he was being sued
sw2531A-ms98-a-0082 443.590375 449.683875 because this guy was breaking into his store he got electrocuted and was killed coming into his store
sw2531A-ms98-a-0083 449.683875 453.602750 [silence]
sw2531A-ms98-a-0084 453.602750 468.159625 that's right that's right you know now here's the innocent [laughter-guy] that's just trying to keep in business you know he had tried dogs he tried security people he tried you know several other things the dogs like they would just kill the dogs you know so uh it's
sw2531A-ms98-a-0085 468.159625 472.779125 it['s]- it's wrong your right [laughter] um i
sw2531A-ms98-a-0086 472.779125 483.205750 it it seems unfortunate and a little frustrating because it seems like we have citizens the there isn't much we can do um you try to hope that uh you know
sw2531A-ms98-a-0087 483.205750 491.077250 your senators and your representatives and uh are going to represent what the people want but uh uh they certainly
sw2531A-ms98-a-0088 491.077250 499.541375 i'm not sure which way to take to shake up the system bad enough to start making some reforms sure would be nice to see it happening soon
sw2531A-ms98-a-0089 499.541375 506.759375 because it's obvious that uh pretty soon they're not going to be able to handle you know all of the crime that there is
sw2531A-ms98-a-0090 506.759375 507.962250 [silence]
sw2531A-ms98-a-0091 507.962250 509.874250 [noise] so [noise] i don't know
sw2531A-ms98-a-0092 509.874250 511.398375 uh
sw2531A-ms98-a-0093 511.398375 518.363750 it must be especially frustrating to you having do you work there now or is was this uh uh was this before
sw2531A-ms98-a-0094 518.363750 526.807250 oh okay so it's just another job uh it must be especially frustrating because even your rights in there [laughter] are
sw2531A-ms98-a-0095 526.807250 530.975625 [silence]
sw2531A-ms98-a-0096 530.975625 536.826750 yeah and boy does that stink uh that's the same way here uh
sw2531A-ms98-a-0097 536.826750 538.383500 [silence]
sw2531A-ms98-a-0098 538.383500 548.137875 and they have more freedom i mean i understand that i mean i'm not i mean you can't be everywhere all the time and i'm sure that they have searches and everything but i mean
sw2531A-ms98-a-0099 548.137875 553.963000 the weapons that they make or [laughter-that] they get and the i mean
sw2531A-ms98-a-0100 553.963000 560.676875 to me it'd be like walking around in a time [laughter-bomb] [laughter-all] the time even just being there you know just working there um 
sw2531A-ms98-a-0101 560.676875 568.144125 because you never know if you're going to get knifed or something uh you know as a guard that it must be scary [laughter] uh
sw2531A-ms98-a-0102 568.144125 569.448125 and yet
sw2531A-ms98-a-0103 569.448125 576.417000 yeah well th[ey]- and yet did they can they do anything to them when they're in prison i mean surely they can
sw2531A-ms98-a-0104 576.417000 580.835000 put them in solitary or something i mean [laughter] or is that just mythical
sw2531A-ms98-a-0105 580.835000 595.821500 [silence]
sw2531A-ms98-a-0106 595.821500 597.770875 oh okay i didn't know that
sw2531A-ms98-a-0107 597.770875 599.934250 [silence]
