sw2531B-ms98-a-0054 403.628125 417.507625 get to such an extent where the average American citizen if they see a crime go down or a crime is happening against them they're not going to worry about trying to get a policeman they're not going to worry about it because they're going to be packing their own heat and they're going to take care of business themselves
