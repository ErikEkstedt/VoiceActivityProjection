sw2539B-ms98-a-0034 139.557500 151.744750 and i don't it would i think it was very beneficial to us i mean like in the summer we were always in the library programs reading books and we went skating a lot and
sw2539B-ms98-a-0035 151.744750 164.663875 you know she was just always there for us but nowadays if there are two parents to a family the mother works just as hard as the father does and the children either stay at home and get into trouble or they're stuck in a day care
sw2539B-ms98-a-0036 164.663875 176.667500 and i just i just don't want my children to have to be raised like that all my friends they their parents worked all the time they got to stay at home by themselves and when i was younger
sw2539B-ms98-a-0037 176.667500 188.211500 i thought they were lucky because they got to get away with things like i couldn't ride my bike across the street but they could because they're Mom would never know it but now i realize that it was better because
