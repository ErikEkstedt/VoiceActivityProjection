sw2539A-ms98-a-0022 130.676750 133.178125 [noise] uh-huh
sw2539A-ms98-a-0023 133.178125 143.920000 [silence]

sw2539A-ms98-a-0032 195.097750 205.982125 well that that certainly can happen now if you you say you're in communications uh what base of communications would you be most interested in getting in to
sw2539A-ms98-a-0033 205.982125 208.461000 [silence]
sw2539A-ms98-a-0034 208.461000 214.018125 public relations so so you would have a job with a company
sw2539A-ms98-a-0035 214.018125 219.214250 rather than uh radio or television or newspapers or what have you
sw2539A-ms98-a-0036 219.214250 224.718125 and uh then you'd be willing to give up your job to stay home and with or stay with the children
sw2539A-ms98-a-0037 224.718125 228.573750 [silence]
sw2539A-ms98-a-0038 228.573750 230.050750 uh-huh
sw2539A-ms98-a-0039 230.050750 236.648000 [silence]
sw2539A-ms98-a-0040 236.648000 237.622000 uh-huh
sw2539A-ms98-a-0041 237.622000 239.987875 [silence]
sw2539A-ms98-a-0042 239.987875 241.263750 uh-huh
sw2539A-ms98-a-0043 241.263750 247.213375 [silence]
sw2539A-ms98-a-0044 247.213375 249.157125 uh-huh
sw2539A-ms98-a-0045 249.157125 252.060000 [silence]
sw2539A-ms98-a-0046 252.060000 254.497375 uh-huh uh-huh
sw2539A-ms98-a-0047 254.497375 260.938625 well that that's uh is an advantage of being in the education field i spent thirty four years in education
sw2539A-ms98-a-0048 260.938625 275.932875 yes and so oh i started out with college and then went to high school and then i preferred the high school age level much better than i did the college because you have a closer relationship with the uh students but
sw2539A-ms98-a-0049 275.932875 277.944625 that i taught physical education
sw2539A-ms98-a-0050 277.944625 280.063375 [silence]
sw2539A-ms98-a-0051 280.063375 281.597500 uh-huh
sw2539A-ms98-a-0052 281.597500 284.344875 [silence]
sw2539A-ms98-a-0053 284.344875 294.715375 well i uh i found that uh it was a perfect combination from the standpoint of having vacations off at the same time
sw2539A-ms98-a-0054 294.715375 303.005125 and uh and it worked out fine from that standpoint uh plus the fact that uh when when i left uh
sw2539A-ms98-a-0055 303.005125 316.977125 usually uh my husband was seldom home for maybe forty five minutes or so and then our son he had to get on the bus and he did get on the bus it was his responsibility and he never ever thought
sw2539A-ms98-a-0056 316.977125 320.999375 of uh not going to school he said in view of the fact that
sw2539A-ms98-a-0057 320.999375 332.641500 he was certain i had a hot line to his school because uh i uh well i i was in physical education then and i just kept getting pushed into administration wound up in administration
sw2539A-ms98-a-0058 332.641500 344.682750 and so he thought surely that i or i would have bought a hot line to know if he ever skipped school which of course was not the case and i wouldn't have checked on him however uh there are there are points
sw2539A-ms98-a-0059 344.682750 349.831250 both directions in that uh from the standpoint of parents working and not working
sw2539A-ms98-a-0060 349.831250 362.321500 uh i listened to more than one parent say i don't know what this child wants i'm working two jobs they each have their own television they each have their own telephone they each have their own rooms they each have this they each have that
sw2539A-ms98-a-0061 362.321500 365.453375 i'd say but what they don't have is you
sw2539A-ms98-a-0062 365.453375 371.442000 absolutely and uh acting out because that is the way of getting attention
sw2539A-ms98-a-0063 371.442000 377.174625 [silence]
sw2539A-ms98-a-0064 377.174625 378.948500 that's right
sw2539A-ms98-a-0065 378.948500 381.082500 [silence]
sw2539A-ms98-a-0066 381.082500 381.911125 huh
sw2539A-ms98-a-0067 381.911125 387.285250 [silence]
sw2539A-ms98-a-0068 387.285250 388.829125 uh-huh
sw2539A-ms98-a-0069 388.829125 394.881625 [silence]
sw2539A-ms98-a-0070 394.881625 395.708250 right
sw2539A-ms98-a-0071 395.708250 401.365875 [silence]
sw2539A-ms98-a-0072 401.365875 414.745500 and we certainly uh we need more of that we need more parents willing to supervise though we've had such a breakdown in the family structure from the standpoint of of uh church and school and everything along the way
sw2539A-ms98-a-0073 414.745500 423.416500 and that i think has contributed much to uh the delinquency that works grant and the poor school results that we're having
sw2539A-ms98-a-0074 423.416500 430.668000 uh that the students uh parents have just not really taken enough interest in them from the very very beginning and i think
sw2539A-ms98-a-0075 430.668000 440.614375 my feeling was that the very best teachers should be in grades one two and three to get the students off to a good start let them have positive um
sw2539A-ms98-a-0076 440.614375 454.572500 uh experiences from the lower levels so they want to continue learning and uh keep going and not wait until they're they're in the ninth and tenth grades it's too late then you cannot reverse that trend at that point
sw2539A-ms98-a-0077 454.572500 469.089375 right and uh while parents very often will be involved with the school activities when the child's in the elementary school and they get into the high schools so often they seem to drop away at that point and that is just as valuable
sw2539A-ms98-a-0078 469.089375 473.520375 at that time as to the rush in the elementary yes right
sw2539A-ms98-a-0079 473.520375 476.129875 [silence]
sw2539A-ms98-a-0080 476.129875 484.732125 right and uh the child needs to take pride in the fact that their parent is doing something uh we were fortunate in view of the fact that
sw2539A-ms98-a-0081 484.732125 492.816625 my son did play football and i did keep statistics for his team and his Dad did take movies of the football
sw2539A-ms98-a-0082 492.816625 502.645875 team and movies of the basketball team and we tried to be a part of it but not overshadowing him or making him feel that we had to be there all the time
sw2539A-ms98-a-0083 502.645875 508.435250 so wh[at]- i feel that i learned a great deal from my students
sw2539A-ms98-a-0084 508.435250 510.462875 uh with regard to
sw2539A-ms98-a-0085 510.462875 522.822875 what their biggest complaints were with parents and a thing such as uh one of the biggest complaints i well remember because i spent a lot of time with seniors uh was um
sw2539A-ms98-a-0086 522.822875 536.617375 caring their parents say when i was your age i didn't have this or that and i know i never ever said that because i knew that that was one thing that was really irritating to young people
sw2539A-ms98-a-0087 536.617375 538.949500 [silence]
sw2539A-ms98-a-0088 538.949500 546.622500 yes and i had to deal with their problems and i could talk about the kinds of problems which they were bringing that they had
sw2539A-ms98-a-0089 546.622500 556.845500 just in general aspect and our son would share this and then he would have to make decisions for himself along those same types of of uh lines
sw2539A-ms98-a-0090 556.845500 562.036125 so that i think he benefited from my experiences
sw2539A-ms98-a-0091 562.036125 563.184000 no
sw2539A-ms98-a-0092 563.184000 571.967625 no he uh works uh for a different company yeah in the Dallas area but when he went away to coll[ege]- and he was on an allowance
sw2539A-ms98-a-0093 571.967625 580.506375 from the time he was in the seventh grade and uh a small allowance and all the way through college and he held three jobs
sw2539A-ms98-a-0094 580.506375 590.905500 while he was in college and we didn't even know it he didn't even tell us uh that he had three jobs but when he graduated he had a five thousand dollar bank account
sw2539A-ms98-a-0095 590.905500 600.657375 and uh we had told him that if he ever wanted to go to college he could go if he got married he was on his own if he flunked out he was on his own
