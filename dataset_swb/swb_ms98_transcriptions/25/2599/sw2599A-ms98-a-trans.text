sw2599A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.466000 [silence]
sw2599A-ms98-a-0002 0.466000 12.685875 uh i don't know i'm not a real great ba[ll]- uh football follower i guess there are two basic teams that i seem to follow every year one is the Dallas Cowboys and the other is the Oklahoma Sooners 
sw2599A-ms98-a-0003 12.685875 20.206375 uh being a a native {Okie} i uh i like to keep up with what the homeboys are doing uh
sw2599A-ms98-a-0004 20.206375 22.230125 [silence]
sw2599A-ms98-a-0005 22.230125 34.067500 no you know it's funny uh i got out and got my bachelor's degree in uh seventy three and uh never went to a game there and have never gone to a game since
sw2599A-ms98-a-0006 34.067500 40.612625 but i always enjoyed watching them i just growing up in uh in Oklahoma there it was always the home team kind of like Dallas is around here
sw2599A-ms98-a-0007 40.612625 42.746375 and there's always been an interest there
sw2599A-ms98-a-0008 42.746375 48.130125 [silence]
sw2599A-ms98-a-0009 48.130125 49.365625 yeah
sw2599A-ms98-a-0010 49.365625 54.164000 [silence]
sw2599A-ms98-a-0011 54.164000 66.698500 i guess you keep those things you grew up with i worked in uh Missouri for a while and uh i was probably the only one in the room several times when we were watching football on TV when the Cowboys were playing the Saint Louis Cardinals and i was rooting for the Cowboys
sw2599A-ms98-a-0012 66.698500 76.983250 but they were kind of closer to home and and i stuck up with them i really don't know what's going to take place with with the Cowboys this year uh everybody keeps talking about the reconstruction they're going through
sw2599A-ms98-a-0013 76.983250 81.727500 and new players and how next year is going to be even bigger and better than the previous year
sw2599A-ms98-a-0014 81.727500 91.046750 in a way that happened this past season and i think there's quite a bit of optimism around here that still there's there's a chance that maybe uh
sw2599A-ms98-a-0015 91.046750 96.511000 uh these guys are right maybe they will come through and and do something this year i look for it to be a pretty good year
sw2599A-ms98-a-0016 96.511000 99.363750 [silence]
sw2599A-ms98-a-0017 99.363750 106.544375 they did uh they got rid of a lot of familiar names and got a lot of names in that we weren't uh weren't familiar with
sw2599A-ms98-a-0018 106.544375 120.872250 some of them turned out to be pretty good players uh some of them didn't and you know maybe the stuff that uh Jerry Jones is talking about the uh the reconstruction and redefining the team and maybe the effort might be starting to pay off at least we hope it will
sw2599A-ms98-a-0019 120.872250 141.248000 [silence]
sw2599A-ms98-a-0020 141.248000 144.636625 yeah but they have always been a really strong team
sw2599A-ms98-a-0021 144.636625 154.979750 [silence]
sw2599A-ms98-a-0022 154.979750 163.805250 once the pressure gets turned on they they seem to lose it now see that's the typical trait of the Dallas Cowboys and and the Oklahoma Sooners it's funny over the years
sw2599A-ms98-a-0023 163.805250 164.973375 [silence]
sw2599A-ms98-a-0024 164.973375 173.346625 it's it's been a rough tow a rough road to hoe ever since he left i don't know why it's so hard to find uh a good quarterback these days
sw2599A-ms98-a-0025 173.346625 177.001125 [silence]
sw2599A-ms98-a-0026 177.001125 184.327625 well yeah you know he was [vocalized-noise] um one of the few who've come through in history that can really perform uh
sw2599A-ms98-a-0027 184.327625 191.852500 we hope every team hopes their current quarterback is going to pull them through in a way Aikman has done some of that
sw2599A-ms98-a-0028 191.852500 197.194500 but uh the guy winds up getting hurt every other game and you can't do that and stay
sw2599A-ms98-a-0029 197.194500 205.909125 [silence]
sw2599A-ms98-a-0030 205.909125 215.496625 yeah they did they put a lot of pressure on him from the outside and from the inside uh it's funny watching them them play [vocalized-noise] he's probably like a lot of quarterbacks uh
sw2599A-ms98-a-0031 215.496625 223.202500 when the pressure is really on when it's down to the last few minutes of the game for the season is when the guys seem to really do their best
sw2599A-ms98-a-0032 223.202500 230.238000 and i haven't quite figured that out if if they figure they have got it won or if there's no real hurry because the first three quarters
sw2599A-ms98-a-0033 230.238000 241.759250 or uh if [vocalized-noise] if something happens that that adrenaline really starts flowing they say hey we got to do something now and and start playing the game the way the game should be played toward the last few [vocalized-noise] few minutes
sw2599A-ms98-a-0034 241.759250 246.631875 so i don't know i'm looking for for a good year i guess we're always looking for a good year
sw2599A-ms98-a-0035 246.631875 253.951125 [silence]
sw2599A-ms98-a-0036 253.951125 266.157875 uh no i don't think the Cowboys have got a chance i think they will probably win one or two more games than they did this year and they'll get close to it they'll probably get everybody's hopes up and and blow it toward the end
sw2599A-ms98-a-0037 266.157875 267.986625 [silence]
sw2599A-ms98-a-0038 267.986625 276.565500 uh that's a good question uh i'm figuring either one either the Eagles or possibly San Francisco i'm not real sure i don't
sw2599A-ms98-a-0039 276.565500 277.580875 [silence]
sw2599A-ms98-a-0040 277.580875 287.165875 they did so i don't know how these changes are going to help or hinder the the team sometimes it brings in new motivation and and y[ou]- all you can do is get out of the way because here they come
sw2599A-ms98-a-0041 287.165875 292.448625 [silence]
sw2599A-ms98-a-0042 292.448625 294.046750 well that's true
sw2599A-ms98-a-0043 294.046750 298.006250 they are tough and they're big they're mean and they are going to come right through you if you don't [vocalized-noise] do something
sw2599A-ms98-a-0044 298.006250 300.483125 [silence]
sw2599A-ms98-a-0045 300.483125 302.500500 oh yeah yeah
sw2599A-ms98-a-0046 302.500500 303.852625 no
sw2599A-ms98-a-0047 303.852625 304.870125 [silence]
sw2599A-ms98-a-0048 304.870125 310.255000 no and it's funny you know You like to pull for the underdog and for a long time i was pulling for Denver
sw2599A-ms98-a-0049 310.255000 319.471375 uh Marino makes me just crazy mad sometimes because of some of the stupid stuff he does but he's a good quarterback he's got a good arm sometimes it's too good because he throws too hard
sw2599A-ms98-a-0050 319.471375 322.570875 i mean Elway sorry and
sw2599A-ms98-a-0051 322.570875 323.166500 [noise]

sw2599A-ms98-a-0054 329.380125 332.509375 [silence]
