sw2599B-ms98-a-0008 39.687000 41.887375 yeah yeah
sw2599B-ms98-a-0009 41.887375 50.861500 well it's kind of same for me i i grew up in uh southern New Jersey and the local team was Philadelphia and they were like you know thirty miles right up the river
sw2599B-ms98-a-0010 50.861500 54.371125 and i'm still pretty much a Eagle fan i guess
sw2599B-ms98-a-0011 54.371125 64.688000 [silence]
sw2599B-ms98-a-0012 64.688000 67.129125 yeah yeah
sw2599B-ms98-a-0013 67.129125 95.647750 [silence]
sw2599B-ms98-a-0014 95.647750 99.708375 boy they uh they sure did have a big turn around from a couple of years ago
sw2599B-ms98-a-0015 99.708375 120.351125 [silence]
sw2599B-ms98-a-0016 120.351125 130.315500 yeah i'm i keep waiting for the Eagles to get over the hump they make it to the play-offs it seems for the last few years but they just have done absolutely nothing when they [laughter-got] [laughter-there]
sw2599B-ms98-a-0017 130.315500 142.493500 and you know they've they've got a lot of the tools to do it but doggone if they can't just put it together uh you know they got the quarterback there in Randal Cunningham who's just you know phenomenal but he he's too streaky it seems
sw2599B-ms98-a-0018 142.493500 143.737875 [silence]
sw2599B-ms98-a-0019 143.737875 154.298875 yeah yeah and wi[th]- without a whole lot of big name players they have got a few anchors on offense and defense and you know they they've managed with those guys and
sw2599B-ms98-a-0020 154.298875 155.750750 i don't know
sw2599B-ms98-a-0021 155.750750 157.708125 [silence]

sw2599B-ms98-a-0026 162.223000 168.299625 i guess since Staubach left they haven't been able to keep it going [laughter-yeah]
sw2599B-ms98-a-0027 168.299625 169.868375 yeah
sw2599B-ms98-a-0028 169.868375 172.807375 [silence]

sw2599B-ms98-a-0033 194.664250 207.097875 yeah i i tell you it's it's difficult in in that guy's position coming into that because there he was just so highly touted by the press and everybody expected so many big things you know
sw2599B-ms98-a-0034 207.097875 222.430750 [silence]
