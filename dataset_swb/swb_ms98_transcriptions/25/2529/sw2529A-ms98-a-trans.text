sw2529A-ms98-a-0006 36.184125 38.194000 okay yeah

sw2529A-ms98-a-0008 53.857000 59.002500 yeah and that's that's funny you're in human resources and i'm in uh health and safety
sw2529A-ms98-a-0009 59.002500 61.597125 yes um
sw2529A-ms98-a-0010 61.597125 71.360625 i think it's a good idea i- i- i don't think that they've gone far enough though i think they should they should uh also test for alcohol
sw2529A-ms98-a-0011 71.360625 90.470875 [silence]
sw2529A-ms98-a-0012 90.470875 92.171250 right but
sw2529A-ms98-a-0013 92.171250 93.523250 [silence]
sw2529A-ms98-a-0014 93.523250 94.807875 yeah
sw2529A-ms98-a-0015 94.807875 104.521250 no and and from everything that i can gather you know reading different articles and and just a newspaper in general uh
sw2529A-ms98-a-0016 104.521250 107.888250 uh news on the um television
sw2529A-ms98-a-0017 107.888250 115.094250 [noise] it seems that alcohol is the is the most prevalent um a[ddictive]- addictive drug
sw2529A-ms98-a-0018 115.094250 124.410000 even though the all the college campuses now the they're saying that the majority of of uh students uh drink
sw2529A-ms98-a-0019 124.410000 127.150500 and most of them_1 are partying
sw2529A-ms98-a-0020 127.150500 137.483375 but yet we don't test for that and i wonder if we don't do that because it is so prevalent and would put probably lose
sw2529A-ms98-a-0021 137.483375 140.148000 a quarter of all our population here
sw2529A-ms98-a-0022 140.148000 141.060500 [laughter]
sw2529A-ms98-a-0023 141.060500 146.970500 [silence]
sw2529A-ms98-a-0024 146.970500 151.306500 well they say your system a normal a normal person
sw2529A-ms98-a-0025 151.306500 155.222250 should be able to metabolize an ounce of alcohol per hour
sw2529A-ms98-a-0026 155.222250 156.300625 [silence]
sw2529A-ms98-a-0027 156.300625 168.319625 and then again it it de[pends]- depends on the the bigger you are and you know the more bulk that you have you you can your system can tolerate more alcohol so a large person can probably 
sw2529A-ms98-a-0028 168.319625 169.719250 um
sw2529A-ms98-a-0029 169.719250 172.485000 metabolize maybe a little bit more
sw2529A-ms98-a-0030 172.485000 174.206500 than a smaller person
sw2529A-ms98-a-0031 174.206500 177.838625 but even that yeah if you go out you know because_1 some people go out maybe
sw2529A-ms98-a-0032 177.838625 179.110750 [laughter]
sw2529A-ms98-a-0033 179.110750 181.164125 oh you know they drink up a gallon

sw2529A-ms98-a-0035 182.175125 183.700375 um
sw2529A-ms98-a-0036 183.700375 195.831375 what's what's the uh consensus down there when when uh TI announced that uh the drug testing program did you get a lot of uh animosity against that
sw2529A-ms98-a-0037 195.831375 227.170625 [silence]
sw2529A-ms98-a-0038 227.170625 228.410000 yeah

sw2529A-ms98-a-0040 252.293125 255.689250 yes no that's you're right yeah
sw2529A-ms98-a-0041 255.689250 269.969000 [silence]
sw2529A-ms98-a-0042 269.969000 272.800000 sure that's an idea too i just uh
sw2529A-ms98-a-0043 272.800000 282.774875 [silence]
sw2529A-ms98-a-0044 282.774875 287.992000 yeah that's a that's a thought um i don't know if you can go
sw2529A-ms98-a-0045 287.992000 296.116250 depends on the severity of the accident i think you know if you get like up here because we've got heavy industry we've got you know uh uh smelting
sw2529A-ms98-a-0046 296.116250 297.869000 plant and we've got a
sw2529A-ms98-a-0047 297.869000 304.700000 we've got a lot of uh metals rolling and slitting and stuff like that so we've got a lot of we are we end up with a lot of uh
sw2529A-ms98-a-0048 304.700000 311.053500 [noise] hand injuries you know cuts and things like that but perhaps um
sw2529A-ms98-a-0049 311.053500 318.637250 if you could weed out those the people that have chronic accidents and test those you know that's a start
sw2529A-ms98-a-0050 318.637250 321.132750 and that's a good id[ea]- that's a good point
sw2529A-ms98-a-0051 321.132750 331.570625 [silence]
sw2529A-ms98-a-0052 331.570625 333.302375 yes

sw2529A-ms98-a-0054 348.603750 350.978750 [noise] oh okay yeah
sw2529A-ms98-a-0055 350.978750 367.887375 [silence]
sw2529A-ms98-a-0056 367.887375 374.859375 well i can see transportation because now you're dealing with or they have the responsibility over a great
sw2529A-ms98-a-0057 374.859375 377.030750 number of people
sw2529A-ms98-a-0058 377.030750 379.986125 rather than themselves um
sw2529A-ms98-a-0059 379.986125 387.414750 but but thinking on that yeah because_1 we've got we've got truck drivers here that go between plants you know locally
sw2529A-ms98-a-0060 387.414750 391.051875 and carry material and they carry acids and things too
sw2529A-ms98-a-0061 391.051875 400.695625 um i don't know what the what the uh company plant is they went through i guess key personnel first
sw2529A-ms98-a-0062 400.695625 406.254625 [noise] and then it funneled down to uh the general population
sw2529A-ms98-a-0063 406.254625 407.273125 [silence]
sw2529A-ms98-a-0064 407.273125 409.025000 but i wonder if
sw2529A-ms98-a-0065 409.025000 410.417250 [silence]
sw2529A-ms98-a-0066 410.417250 423.446750 yeah and i- i still haven't been called yet in fact yeah in fact out of our office staff is let's see there's uh four six there's seven of us and there's only one been called
sw2529A-ms98-a-0067 423.446750 425.427875 [silence]

sw2529A-ms98-a-0077 457.317375 469.534500 well it's not only that but i've read different articles and they said even the even the best of labs they come back with erroneous samples and even if they get a a reading i guess they test the same sample again
sw2529A-ms98-a-0078 469.534500 470.755250 [silence]
sw2529A-ms98-a-0079 470.755250 475.122375 and they're going to get the same reading suppose they uh you know it's a
sw2529A-ms98-a-0080 475.122375 480.014250 do they crucify you right then and there or do they do they go back and retest
sw2529A-ms98-a-0081 480.014250 487.448000 [silence]
sw2529A-ms98-a-0082 487.448000 489.796750 but they retest the same sample

sw2529A-ms98-a-0084 493.888625 496.998250 oh i see oh okay

sw2529A-ms98-a-0086 498.809000 501.600000 but if they do then you're you're pretty well
sw2529A-ms98-a-0087 501.600000 503.420125 condemned right
sw2529A-ms98-a-0088 503.420125 508.328125 [silence]
sw2529A-ms98-a-0089 508.328125 510.184250 to be retested

sw2529A-ms98-a-0096 545.111000 549.873125 do you know of any incidences of of of uh erroneous
sw2529A-ms98-a-0097 549.873125 555.034000 you know something the[y]- they make a mistake the lab made a mistake and it really wasn't nothing

sw2529A-ms98-a-0099 562.849125 566.122125 oh just to see j[ust]- just to check on a lab
