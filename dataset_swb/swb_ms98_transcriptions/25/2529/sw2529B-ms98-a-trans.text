sw2529B-ms98-a-0002 1.233125 13.524625 um she asked if i- i guess they went ahead and told you we're supposed to be talking about uh drug testing and what do we think about the policy of most companies and government agencies and of course that's something we're familiar with [laughter]
sw2529B-ms98-a-0003 13.524625 15.329625 [vocalized-noise]
sw2529B-ms98-a-0004 15.329625 17.737750 you want to go ahead or
sw2529B-ms98-a-0005 17.737750 22.147875 um personally it was something that uh
sw2529B-ms98-a-0006 22.147875 29.354500 i mean i know it presents an emotional issue moral issue people feel like maybe my rights are being violated but i work in human resources
sw2529B-ms98-a-0007 29.354500 37.386875 so i work with a lot of folks that um are in accidents or where safety considerations are concerned and
sw2529B-ms98-a-0008 37.386875 51.606000 i really feel like that TI's decision to go with drug testing was good you know because i- i feel like that you know w[ell]- all all it takes is one person coming to work under the influence of some narcotic um
sw2529B-ms98-a-0009 51.606000 54.216125 truly injure a lot more of our workers

sw2529B-ms98-a-0014 71.373000 76.778875 well now the thing y[ou]- you know course they've always said separately that um
sw2529B-ms98-a-0015 76.778875 77.790000 [silence]
sw2529B-ms98-a-0016 77.790000 91.160750 you know we have a we have a policy on alcohol course if anybody's under the uh influence or if you have reasonable suspicion then that would result in corrective action for them also and that of course has been in place for years
sw2529B-ms98-a-0017 91.160750 94.378375 but it's not specifically tested for that
sw2529B-ms98-a-0018 94.378375 95.706625 yeah

sw2529B-ms98-a-0035 181.876125 191.824000 [silence]
sw2529B-ms98-a-0036 191.824000 193.241500 we had
sw2529B-ms98-a-0037 193.241500 194.332750 [silence]
sw2529B-ms98-a-0038 194.332750 198.073625 i didn't get a lot no not like i expected um
sw2529B-ms98-a-0039 198.073625 206.838375 we had you know one or two that were extremely outspoken you know felt like it really violated their rights and and um
sw2529B-ms98-a-0040 206.838375 215.540000 and it was not the people that i would have expected um it's uh one of them_1 stands out in my mind as an extremely uh 
sw2529B-ms98-a-0041 215.540000 222.514875 just a super person in management you know and he's he's very family oriented his family's very close he
sw2529B-ms98-a-0042 222.514875 232.260500 he also opposes in the schools like for his kids because he says you know we are a good Christian family we do not do this type of thing it definitely violates our rights and he was very outspoken
sw2529B-ms98-a-0043 232.260500 245.492125 but for the most part people were like well i don't like it uh it's not something i prefer to do but i understand the reasoning and i think part of the attitude is that i think TI went to really great lengths
sw2529B-ms98-a-0044 245.492125 254.183000 in communicating and tried to prepare them_1 and and tell them_1 why and you know they didn't just announce it without really any forethought
sw2529B-ms98-a-0045 254.183000 267.092250 and uh i- i think they don't go far enough uh kind of on a different vein and that is that i think every time we have any type of industrial accident at TI i think somebody ought to be tested immediately
sw2529B-ms98-a-0046 267.092250 271.307500 and you know maybe that's just me personally but i- i feel like
sw2529B-ms98-a-0047 271.307500 283.146000 you know i- i feel like if something happens uh that causes an accident you ought to test the parties involved immediately just just i[f]- if nothing else to rule it out
sw2529B-ms98-a-0048 283.146000 284.596750 um
sw2529B-ms98-a-0049 284.596750 296.116500 [silence]
sw2529B-ms98-a-0050 296.116500 297.596250 yeah

sw2529B-ms98-a-0056 321.609375 326.235500 i guess what makes me think of that you know uh you hear them doing that like it's a
sw2529B-ms98-a-0057 326.235500 340.486125 [noise] or like Amtrak you know if if they have a derailment or or transportation industry it seems like if there's accidents train accidents things like that they test and i think well why not because we do have some large industrial accidents sometimes
sw2529B-ms98-a-0058 340.486125 350.878375 uh you know if you have a large acid spill you know well gee maybe you better check this person who's handling all these acids you know i work with a wafer fab so we do a lot with chemicals and acids and
sw2529B-ms98-a-0059 350.878375 354.573375 uh things like that but i
sw2529B-ms98-a-0060 354.573375 368.535375 i do feel like companies are justified and i do feel like i- i mean i- i guess i hate as an individual that anything like this has ever become necessary in our you know in our nation but but i feel like that it's a good thing to do
sw2529B-ms98-a-0061 368.535375 376.191750 [silence]
sw2529B-ms98-a-0062 376.191750 377.638000 that's true

sw2529B-ms98-a-0075 423.248125 425.821375 well i've been lucky i've been called twice
sw2529B-ms98-a-0076 425.821375 429.483625 [laughter] well i
sw2529B-ms98-a-0077 429.483625 442.471750 no i had to test once um when they did the key personnel they test all human resource folks and so i- i- i was once there and then in the general random sampling last year i was i contacted
sw2529B-ms98-a-0078 442.471750 450.040125 yeah and that you know i have that same uneasy feeling that other folks have you know i know i- [vocalized-noise] i mean i don't drink i don't smoke i don't do nothing [laughter] 
sw2529B-ms98-a-0079 450.040125 458.027250 you know but you still walk in there and go gee what if something i ate what if something i've done what if something i've eaten shows up

sw2529B-ms98-a-0086 479.750625 487.112375 well now if the lab is making an error on the sample then when they retest the error should not be there
sw2529B-ms98-a-0087 487.112375 488.871750 uh
sw2529B-ms98-a-0088 488.871750 499.739500 [noise] yeah but the error is on the part of the lab not on the sample in other words if somebody makes a mistake in what they're reading then they're not going to get the same reading the second time
sw2529B-ms98-a-0089 499.739500 500.930250 [silence]
sw2529B-ms98-a-0090 500.930250 514.429000 if they do then you have you always have the recourse um you know before we do anything we sit down and talk with the person about is there any reason why this should have shown up and a lot of times you know uh
sw2529B-ms98-a-0091 514.429000 519.316625 [noise] they'll go oh yeah i was on a prescription for this and they can go get it and bring it in
sw2529B-ms98-a-0092 519.316625 526.710875 you know in which case they're fine obviously those are recorded as negatives if you're under you know legal qualified medical care
sw2529B-ms98-a-0093 526.710875 528.117000 um
sw2529B-ms98-a-0094 528.117000 535.140875 if if we're talking [laughter-marijuana] if it's in the system uh then
sw2529B-ms98-a-0095 535.140875 545.873750 yeah you know that would be grounds for uh if it's their second positive it would be grounds for termination if it's their first positive then they're setup with E A P counseling
sw2529B-ms98-a-0096 545.873750 547.754875 [silence]

sw2529B-ms98-a-0100 554.205500 562.031250 no in fact see TI actually sends uh test samples from time to time
sw2529B-ms98-a-0101 562.031250 563.507875 uh
sw2529B-ms98-a-0102 563.507875 566.948125 just to check the validity of the lab yeah
sw2529B-ms98-a-0103 566.948125 575.694875 and uh so that's kind of an ongoing test process for the we do for Compucam and you know they don't know which ones are test samples
sw2529B-ms98-a-0104 575.694875 576.861000 [silence]

sw2529B-ms98-a-0109 585.313375 590.310375 and ours actually are mailed there uh [noise] they're the
sw2529B-ms98-a-0110 590.310375 597.965375 i think the largest and they do a lot of the government contractors they have an excellent excellent rate um
sw2529B-ms98-a-0111 597.965375 599.766250 and just uh the[y]-
