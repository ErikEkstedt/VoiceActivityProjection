sw2580B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.465000 [noise]
sw2580B-ms98-a-0002 0.465000 1.635875 [silence]
sw2580B-ms98-a-0003 1.635875 4.534250 yeah how many times have you called or or participated
sw2580B-ms98-a-0004 4.534250 6.983750 [silence]
sw2580B-ms98-a-0005 6.983750 9.121625 okay i i'm a little less than that i was
sw2580B-ms98-a-0006 9.121625 17.998125 going to call this week i forgot about it just until i was going to do it tonight uh i have i was i called i think every day last week and i forgot about this week i just got so tied up with some other things 
sw2580B-ms98-a-0007 17.998125 19.891750 i got about ten i think
sw2580B-ms98-a-0008 19.891750 22.540250 [silence]
sw2580B-ms98-a-0009 22.540250 23.917500 voting
sw2580B-ms98-a-0010 23.917500 36.504875 [silence]
sw2580B-ms98-a-0011 36.504875 38.364500 oh yeah i'm sure
sw2580B-ms98-a-0012 38.364500 41.634000 [silence]
sw2580B-ms98-a-0013 41.634000 47.889500 i would think they would talk about people who are already registered and and uh you know the ones that are on the rolls already you know
sw2580B-ms98-a-0014 47.889500 53.011375 i'm amazed myself sometimes i've got some ideas and they've tried a few things but [vocalized-noise] you first
sw2580B-ms98-a-0015 53.011375 66.527625 [silence]
sw2580B-ms98-a-0016 66.527625 67.649625 yeah
sw2580B-ms98-a-0017 67.649625 69.481750 [silence]
sw2580B-ms98-a-0018 69.481750 70.380000 yeah
sw2580B-ms98-a-0019 70.380000 72.646500 [silence]
sw2580B-ms98-a-0020 72.646500 78.594875 yeah i i'm kind of with you in fact i even think that the there's a consp[iracy]- i wouldn't call it a conspiracy but
sw2580B-ms98-a-0021 78.594875 87.117250 you know if you really wanted uh you know hundred and hundred million people to vote why would you have voting from seven o'clock in the morning to seven o'clock at night for a national election
sw2580B-ms98-a-0022 87.117250 90.839875 to me you need to have two what's wrong with having two days uh
sw2580B-ms98-a-0023 90.839875 96.995625 Thursday Friday or three two and a days Thursday Friday and Saturday or something you know where people can vote uh
sw2580B-ms98-a-0024 96.995625 100.714000 i don't think there's a [vocalized-noise] i don't think there's a lot of politicians want
sw2580B-ms98-a-0025 100.714000 103.449375 a heavy vote out because uh
sw2580B-ms98-a-0026 103.449375 111.465250 i can agree in local elect[ions]- elections which usually are on Saturdays and i'm not too sure that's the best idea i think maybe you should have it
sw2580B-ms98-a-0027 111.465250 117.591875 you know Friday noon till Saturday so that people who i like do things during the week
sw2580B-ms98-a-0028 117.591875 126.875250 and i might do it and i- i really think that they don't try you know i- i really think it's obvious the answers to me is just to have longer you know have at least two days for a national election my goodness
sw2580B-ms98-a-0029 126.875250 130.513875 [silence]
sw2580B-ms98-a-0030 130.513875 132.087000 right right
sw2580B-ms98-a-0031 132.087000 141.390875 [silence]
sw2580B-ms98-a-0032 141.390875 142.763375 right
sw2580B-ms98-a-0033 142.763375 145.670125 [silence]
sw2580B-ms98-a-0034 145.670125 151.888000 well yeah the seven o'clock in the morning to seven o'clock at night is is usually the average time that most workers go to work you know
sw2580B-ms98-a-0035 151.888000 157.335250 and i'm amazed by that that uh the only good thing they've done lately is have these uh
sw2580B-ms98-a-0036 157.335250 160.161500 uh elections uh
sw2580B-ms98-a-0037 160.161500 162.994375 what do they call it when you can vote ahead of time uh
sw2580B-ms98-a-0038 162.994375 164.420375 absentee 
sw2580B-ms98-a-0039 164.420375 173.075875 and i've done that and actually we've got some high turn outs here in Arlington on some of the absentee because you can vote like two Saturdays before or something like that
sw2580B-ms98-a-0040 173.075875 177.571375 but i think it's amazing that they they keep complaining about people not voting and
sw2580B-ms98-a-0041 177.571375 189.505625 and national elections should be more than one day i mean i don't see how you can have tens of or hundreds of thousands of people that you know just can't quite make it on that particular day for one reason or another you know
sw2580B-ms98-a-0042 189.505625 193.560625 two days to me doesn't seem to be too unrealistic for a national election
sw2580B-ms98-a-0043 193.560625 211.907750 [silence]
sw2580B-ms98-a-0044 211.907750 213.515250 right
sw2580B-ms98-a-0045 213.515250 219.482750 [silence]
sw2580B-ms98-a-0046 219.482750 222.572375 yeah the bonds uh we had some here in Arlington recently but 
sw2580B-ms98-a-0047 222.572375 229.377375 [silence]
sw2580B-ms98-a-0048 229.377375 230.497375 yeah
sw2580B-ms98-a-0049 230.497375 233.725625 i- i don't really know why you have uh
sw2580B-ms98-a-0050 233.725625 243.772625 uh you know in a small city or whatever medium size city you have a couple hundred thousand people eligible you know and you get ten thousand to vote i don't have an answer for that i think that uh
sw2580B-ms98-a-0051 243.772625 250.956625 it is apathy without question uh we are we are not taking it as serious as
sw2580B-ms98-a-0052 250.956625 257.832125 the people who have lost their rights and everything overseas and everything and i think uh i don't know how to change that
sw2580B-ms98-a-0053 257.832125 265.635750 i always try to vote for those and but i and there are some that if when they have them on Saturday i'll say all right i'm going to work i'm going to go vote this afternoon
sw2580B-ms98-a-0054 265.635750 274.701125 and then i'll get busy and if no one reminds me then i will forget so i'm not too sure course i guess that's part of being apathy too but i do try to vote in every one but uh
sw2580B-ms98-a-0055 274.701125 282.358250 i don't i don't have an answer for the local elections and why you have ten percent of the people voting that's really so low i'm amazed
sw2580B-ms98-a-0056 282.358250 285.963250 [silence]
sw2580B-ms98-a-0057 285.963250 288.331500 oh that too that too yeah
sw2580B-ms98-a-0058 288.331500 291.597000 [silence]
sw2580B-ms98-a-0059 291.597000 292.671875 yeah
sw2580B-ms98-a-0060 292.671875 293.890000 [silence]
sw2580B-ms98-a-0061 293.890000 302.076875 but i think in national elections uh again it should be the time is definitely against the people i think you ought to have two days you're voting for president
sw2580B-ms98-a-0062 302.076875 305.768250 uh why is it so sacred to have it on Tuesday
sw2580B-ms98-a-0063 305.768250 317.151625 and uh why couldn't it be Friday and Saturday i don't know what the ideal day is if you're trying to catch a weekend or maybe just Tuesday and Wednesday i'll bet you'd get a lot more people i think the news media has really they jump in there
sw2580B-ms98-a-0064 317.151625 325.415000 and they uh tell you the the that who won before seven thirty and before the ele[ctions]- before the polls are closed
sw2580B-ms98-a-0065 325.415000 330.149875 and i think they jump in way way too early i think that ought to be restricted somehow
sw2580B-ms98-a-0066 330.149875 339.731125 uh they will not restrict it but they just ought to not release i don't know i don't know what districts are releasing the numbers to these newsmen that they can predict
sw2580B-ms98-a-0067 339.731125 348.617875 uh i- i thought the polls had to be closed before you were allowed why would you release it to the newsmen first i- i don't even know how the news media get these numbers
sw2580B-ms98-a-0068 348.617875 354.186375 from the polls i would think that ought to be sacred and and until it's all over
sw2580B-ms98-a-0069 354.186375 372.478375 [silence]
sw2580B-ms98-a-0070 372.478375 374.403750 that primary
sw2580B-ms98-a-0071 374.403750 376.597000 uh yeah i don't
sw2580B-ms98-a-0072 376.597000 380.654375 [silence]
sw2580B-ms98-a-0073 380.654375 382.005375 yeah
sw2580B-ms98-a-0074 382.005375 384.678250 [silence]
sw2580B-ms98-a-0075 384.678250 388.697750 well i think you can say you are an independent too but i don't know uh
sw2580B-ms98-a-0076 388.697750 393.092250 yeah i haven't thought about that much i i've uh
sw2580B-ms98-a-0077 393.092250 397.487625 wondered about it but i haven't really got concerned about it one way or another you know
sw2580B-ms98-a-0078 397.487625 398.837625 uh
sw2580B-ms98-a-0079 398.837625 401.221375 what that holds back or anything
sw2580B-ms98-a-0080 401.221375 404.374000 but you're right it it tha[t]- that is a funny rule
sw2580B-ms98-a-0081 404.374000 406.096875 at least uh
sw2580B-ms98-a-0082 406.096875 410.378500 men and women can vote it's amazing that we can still look overseas and see
sw2580B-ms98-a-0083 410.378500 417.197750 you know this thing in Saudi Arabia and all and they still don't allow women to vote it is still amazing of course we we don't have such a wonderful history that
sw2580B-ms98-a-0084 417.197750 423.581375 you know we didn't allow Blacks to vote uh and we didn't allow women to vote until i don't even know what the year was for women
sw2580B-ms98-a-0085 423.581375 425.900875 nineteen nine or something like that when was that
sw2580B-ms98-a-0086 425.900875 426.979375 [silence]
sw2580B-ms98-a-0087 426.979375 435.298250 so but we're we're changing at least at least we're trying and and maybe this absentee thing will will take a hold and uh get more people to vote 
sw2580B-ms98-a-0088 435.298250 454.312250 [silence]
sw2580B-ms98-a-0089 454.312250 455.597125 um-hum
sw2580B-ms98-a-0090 455.597125 458.413375 [silence]
sw2580B-ms98-a-0091 458.413375 461.007250 yeah i don't know why
sw2580B-ms98-a-0092 461.007250 463.000750 [silence]
sw2580B-ms98-a-0093 463.000750 477.362750 well i think it ultimately i could see why you wouldn't register necessarily when you're eighteen or nineteen because you don't get around to it but i- i think that people should register you know after a year or so i don't it's not really that hard uh
sw2580B-ms98-a-0094 477.362750 482.713125 i haven't thought that people don't vote because they're not registered i really think uh
sw2580B-ms98-a-0095 482.713125 486.550500 of course that apathy too you don't bother to register
sw2580B-ms98-a-0096 486.550500 491.180000 uh i am amazed i don't have an answer for why the numbers are so low
sw2580B-ms98-a-0097 491.180000 495.581750 yeah i think you've got to have a good fight you know you have to have a lot of controversy [laughter]
sw2580B-ms98-a-0098 495.581750 505.140500 [silence]
sw2580B-ms98-a-0099 505.140500 518.918750 right or if it's close you know you like to see them_1 close you don't like to see someone just totally run away with it and in foot[ball]- in a football game or anything even if you're for one team or the other you always like to see let's have a good game which means you want to see a close game you know
sw2580B-ms98-a-0100 518.918750 529.534375 so if there's no controversy if you're not worried about who's going to win if you see you think it's going to be a shoo-in then uh you know you don't vote so uh 
sw2580B-ms98-a-0101 529.534375 533.954750 but at at least i guess we're so far ahead of some of the other countries uh
sw2580B-ms98-a-0102 533.954750 539.446500 that we've still got a better system and and we are we have been doing this for two hundred years so uh
sw2580B-ms98-a-0103 539.446500 542.810375 uh i guess it's still better that a lot of others
sw2580B-ms98-a-0104 542.810375 549.927000 [silence]
sw2580B-ms98-a-0105 549.927000 553.293625 yeah yeah it is surprising how uh
sw2580B-ms98-a-0106 553.293625 556.276375 uh even with low numbers uh
sw2580B-ms98-a-0107 556.276375 558.360000 [silence]
sw2580B-ms98-a-0108 558.360000 559.932375 yeah
sw2580B-ms98-a-0109 559.932375 569.955375 well i here in Arlington we had this baseball thing and it was a big controversy and everyone was talking about it yet the voting was so low it was unbelievable and they were spending a lot of money
sw2580B-ms98-a-0110 569.955375 574.874250 you would have thought we would have had close to half of the people in the city voting for this
sw2580B-ms98-a-0111 574.874250 580.024000 that was going to raise your taxes and it was like twenty five thousand or something like that you know
sw2580B-ms98-a-0112 580.024000 587.396125 so that part of it is still uh there's something that people for some reason they don't really want to vote uh
sw2580B-ms98-a-0113 587.396125 591.972875 and maybe maybe absent maybe you ought to be able to do it on your telephone you know i mean i don't know
sw2580B-ms98-a-0114 591.972875 595.149500 [silence]
sw2580B-ms98-a-0115 595.149500 596.223875 yeah
sw2580B-ms98-a-0116 596.223875 599.185500 and it may come to that you know with the electronic age 
sw2580B-ms98-a-0117 599.185500 600.496750 you put in your code
