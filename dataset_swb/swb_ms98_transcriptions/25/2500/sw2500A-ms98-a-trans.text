sw2500A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 4.574500 child care seems to be uh a uh topic that
sw2500A-ms98-a-0002 4.574500 17.240750 varies i guess with where you are geographically if you're in an area where you got a lot to select from then i guess there are a lot of criterias to choose from but if you're in an area where there's two or three then uh you get what you can take
sw2500A-ms98-a-0003 17.240750 28.477375 and i guess it'd depend on the the age of the child the needs of the child how long the child has to be there if it's a five day a week deal i would certainly look a lot harder than if it was just a couple of days a month
sw2500A-ms98-a-0004 28.477375 35.938125 and uh we're in a situation where it's just one maybe two days a month uh at best so we're
sw2500A-ms98-a-0005 35.938125 48.890375 in only a couple of hours usually what we use them_1 for now is to transport them between school and and uh the day care center and have them_1 wait there just long enough for me to get off work and go pick them_1 up
sw2500A-ms98-a-0006 48.890375 55.771375 so it's nice to uh to just have them there for the the limited time frame but the uh
sw2500A-ms98-a-0007 55.771375 65.397875 the drawback is the pay structures there's so many different situations that these day care centers have to get into they have a lot of the ones have just decided that
sw2500A-ms98-a-0008 65.397875 79.431000 they will simplify their work load by saying if you get on the bus to ride between school and day care you'll pay ten dollars regardless of whether you road one way or both ways and regardless of whether you stayed there just half an hour or three hours
sw2500A-ms98-a-0009 79.431000 86.815500 they just averaged it all out but most kids stay until about six so it will be about ten dollars which will cover the ride and cover the hours you stay
sw2500A-ms98-a-0010 86.815500 95.374000 and i've got uh one kid getting out at two forty five and one getting out at three thirty so the one gets picked up at two forty five gets there by about three
sw2500A-ms98-a-0011 95.374000 98.591875 and i'm there a little before four o'clock to pick them_1 up
sw2500A-ms98-a-0012 98.591875 110.381125 so he doesn't stay there even an hour and the other child is not even there when i get there and doesn't get there until about four it's about thirty minutes to do a ten minute ride in there little bus and
sw2500A-ms98-a-0013 110.381125 123.293875 so the you know just for the doesn't really work out for us too economical to pay twenty dollars for a one way bus ride for these two kids but some days we have to do it some days it just works out to where i don't get into work early enough to get off
sw2500A-ms98-a-0014 123.293875 129.509750 early enough to get them_1 but uh fortunately the other end of the deal is some days my wife uh
sw2500A-ms98-a-0015 129.509750 140.515000 being a dental hygienist works by appointments so she if she has a day scheduled where she has to get the kids into the day care to of them take them to school and she has uh a
sw2500A-ms98-a-0016 140.515000 152.683000 an appointment say at eight thirty and she has to be all the way across town at her office at eight thirty then she needs to have them ride the bus one way and i'll get off in time to hopefully pick both of them up and not have the day care center in the other direction
sw2500A-ms98-a-0017 152.683000 164.348500 but uh just a myriad of of possibilities that these people have to serve so they have a myriad of pay structures but uh i[t]- it can get expensive most of them run uh
sw2500A-ms98-a-0018 164.348500 164.922875 [noise]
sw2500A-ms98-a-0019 164.922875 177.437000 four some as many as five dollars an hour per child for uh what we call drop in care which is the situation we're in we're not a regular so the days we do use them we pay through the nose and uh
sw2500A-ms98-a-0020 177.437000 190.981750 and make their kids stay there we found on in the area that that is letting us pay as little as two fifty an hour that's still five dollars an hour for two of our kids and it it's uh fun we try to keep it to a minimum
sw2500A-ms98-a-0021 190.981750 192.120125 [silence]
sw2500A-ms98-a-0022 192.120125 193.779250 yeah it's
sw2500A-ms98-a-0023 193.779250 216.116250 [silence]
sw2500A-ms98-a-0024 216.116250 217.577625 um-hum
sw2500A-ms98-a-0025 217.577625 220.164500 [silence]
sw2500A-ms98-a-0026 220.164500 221.561750 right
sw2500A-ms98-a-0027 221.561750 227.604000 [silence]
sw2500A-ms98-a-0028 227.604000 228.908125 um-hum
sw2500A-ms98-a-0029 228.908125 245.566500 [silence]
sw2500A-ms98-a-0030 245.566500 246.852750 yeah
sw2500A-ms98-a-0031 246.852750 249.152750 [silence]
sw2500A-ms98-a-0032 249.152750 258.400625 well even if you work out the economics if you get over all the other hurdles of the ratio of of workers to uh kids and uh the uh infant wo[rker]-
sw2500A-ms98-a-0033 258.400625 264.198250 uh worker areas how well that's closed off or how not well that's closed off from the other noise
sw2500A-ms98-a-0034 264.198250 269.189500 uh once you get over all the other hurdles just the economics of it uh it's not
sw2500A-ms98-a-0035 269.189500 276.379000 as much of an impact to stay home as it were if you figure in what it would cost you to go back to work and you know the
sw2500A-ms98-a-0036 276.379000 287.216000 [silence]
sw2500A-ms98-a-0037 287.216000 288.112125 yep
sw2500A-ms98-a-0038 288.112125 289.224250 that
sw2500A-ms98-a-0039 289.224250 290.712375 that's it
sw2500A-ms98-a-0040 290.712375 292.137625 [silence]
sw2500A-ms98-a-0041 292.137625 304.501250 of course you couldn't have known two to three years ago when you were making this decision what the taxes were going to do now the child care what you do pay doesn't not even worth a hill of beans on your tax return can't deduct it so what's it good for [laughter]
sw2500A-ms98-a-0042 304.501250 309.322250 so it's it's gotten it's changed a little bit over the years but uh
sw2500A-ms98-a-0043 309.322250 315.891375 [silence]
sw2500A-ms98-a-0044 315.891375 317.133500 um-hum
sw2500A-ms98-a-0045 317.133500 322.243375 [silence]
sw2500A-ms98-a-0046 322.243375 323.499750 right
sw2500A-ms98-a-0047 323.499750 325.448500 [silence]
sw2500A-ms98-a-0048 325.448500 328.385625 well what the market can bear and
sw2500A-ms98-a-0049 328.385625 333.324125 boy there are kids in thi[s]- this little section of Plano that we're in we're surrounded
sw2500A-ms98-a-0050 333.324125 338.171375 less than a mile we have six different centers to our at our disposal so
sw2500A-ms98-a-0051 338.171375 348.393750 we can go north to two of them_1 or south to three of them_1 or just over west a little bit further and there's two more over there there's just all around us but and we've been to everyone of them_1 over the time
sw2500A-ms98-a-0052 348.393750 357.299625 but the kids uh the kids just well we used to use them a little more than we do now that they're in school and the kids just kind of get tired of them_1
sw2500A-ms98-a-0053 357.299625 369.559500 they get tired of the uh you know what's available to play on and uh and what's outside and and plus they they tend to just shift around in in who runs them_1 for a while and the uh pay structure changes and
sw2500A-ms98-a-0054 369.559500 378.095875 so we've just moved with wherever's it happens to be cheapest and they happen to want to survive at [laughter-and] they want to live at this one for a while 
sw2500A-ms98-a-0055 378.095875 392.703250 and uh we found it cheaper even during the summer for me to uh take off for half a day since we work a four and a half day work week and come home on these Thursdays that she goes to work at uh eleven and get's off at seven thirty at night
sw2500A-ms98-a-0056 392.703250 405.757375 and that she does that on Thursdays and then occasional Saturday's and i can take off on those Thursday's and be home in time t[o]- for her to go off to work and it's cheaper for me to do that and take my vacation even if i uh
sw2500A-ms98-a-0057 405.757375 418.367000 take all thirteen weeks of summer that's less than uh right at a weeks full full uh full week's worth of vacation and i have you know three weeks a year i'm i've been there long enough to do that
sw2500A-ms98-a-0058 418.367000 422.081500 now i always end up in a must take situation anyway so
sw2500A-ms98-a-0059 422.081500 429.800750 we decided to eat it up that way and still take a week off and still have a few days to for whatever week long weekends or the like and
sw2500A-ms98-a-0060 429.800750 437.655875 i think we're going to do that again this summer like we did last summer because_1 we paid close to seven or eight hundred dollars just to have someone come into the home
sw2500A-ms98-a-0061 437.655875 439.923500 at a couple a dollars an hour
sw2500A-ms98-a-0062 439.923500 444.528000 to take care of them on those Thursdays throughout the summer so
sw2500A-ms98-a-0063 444.528000 450.057250 it it's hard to to find the prices i guess that does seem to be one of the major driving factors
sw2500A-ms98-a-0064 450.057250 460.116000 [silence]
sw2500A-ms98-a-0065 460.116000 461.390625 um
sw2500A-ms98-a-0066 461.390625 462.887875 yeah
sw2500A-ms98-a-0067 462.887875 470.314000 [silence]
sw2500A-ms98-a-0068 470.314000 471.594750 oh [laughter-boy]

sw2500A-ms98-a-0073 491.061250 495.270500 well i guess they haven't had the i don't know what the incentive would be but
sw2500A-ms98-a-0074 495.270500 496.521750 um
sw2500A-ms98-a-0075 496.521750 504.931000 i guess with all the ones around the Plano area and figuring that most of them_1 drive south for their jobs maybe they maybe they've done it that way and going with that logic [vocalized-noise]
sw2500A-ms98-a-0076 504.931000 506.403125 [silence]
sw2500A-ms98-a-0077 506.403125 507.791500 yeah
sw2500A-ms98-a-0078 507.791500 510.355750 it must be on what they're counting on
sw2500A-ms98-a-0079 510.355750 512.624500 [silence]
sw2500A-ms98-a-0080 512.624500 519.904375 hum well uh speaking of kids i've got one hollering at me so i better head on [noise] we'll
sw2500A-ms98-a-0081 519.904375 522.039875 cross paths later um bye
