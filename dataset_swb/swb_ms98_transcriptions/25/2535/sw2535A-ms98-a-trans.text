sw2535A-ms98-a-0002 0.338625 5.571500 well i don't know how you feel about this but uh it's really scary to me [laughter]
sw2535A-ms98-a-0003 5.571500 17.999500 there was a thing in our we have a little Lewisville paper that just comes out twice a week and there was a thing in there just this week saying that in all of Denton County Lewisville had the highest crime rate of all of Den[ton]- it 
sw2535A-ms98-a-0004 17.999500 23.122625 i guess that's true but you know you've got to figure uh you've got to look at it like Carrollton is in Denton County
sw2535A-ms98-a-0005 23.122625 34.618750 you know you know and it gets kind of [laughter-scary] you know when you're looking at Lewisville you're looking at Denton you're looking at you know some of the larger cities and and Lewisville had more crime this last year than any of them_1 and
sw2535A-ms98-a-0006 34.618750 39.856875 it's just getting it's just getting really scary and almost uh out of hand you know there's been
sw2535A-ms98-a-0007 39.856875 52.113375 i don't know if you've heard any bu[t]- any of it on the news lately or not but there's been a couple of uh you know uh a few months ago there was a deal in North Dallas where they had the man taking little girls out of their bedrooms breaking into their bedroom wind[ows]-
sw2535A-ms98-a-0008 52.113375 64.457250 at that time there's been a couple of those here in Lewisville over the last few weeks yeah and they're you know they're not sure if we're working with the same guy or not but uh it's really scary you know it really is so
sw2535A-ms98-a-0009 64.457250 69.885375 what are things like you said McKinney do you live in McKinney too are things pretty calm up there or
sw2535A-ms98-a-0010 69.885375 70.944250 [silence]
sw2535A-ms98-a-0011 70.944250 72.431000 yeah
sw2535A-ms98-a-0012 72.431000 78.126375 [silence]
sw2535A-ms98-a-0013 78.126375 79.472500 uh-huh
sw2535A-ms98-a-0014 79.472500 84.518750 [silence]
sw2535A-ms98-a-0015 84.518750 87.117000 oh yeah yeah
sw2535A-ms98-a-0016 87.117000 95.900125 i grew up in i went to high school in Frisco and lived there several years so i was up you know pretty close to where you guys are an[d]- and it was always
sw2535A-ms98-a-0017 95.900125 102.521500 i don't know Frisco there always seemed to be a lot of drugs in Frisco for as small a town as it was there were a lot of drugs
sw2535A-ms98-a-0018 102.521500 110.767125 but as far as major crime there didn't seem to be as you know one of those nice little small towns and nothing ever happened and it would be nice to kind of get back into that so
sw2535A-ms98-a-0019 110.767125 122.188000 i don't know i just don't know [vocalized-noise] i had uh one of these conversations the other day where our topic was uh capital punishment and you know the death penalty and you know what you know we were talking about that 
sw2535A-ms98-a-0020 122.188000 132.257000 and one of the things that we kind of got to talking about is you know what is it we can do you know what can what can be done to stop it and i'm not sure that i know the answer to that question
sw2535A-ms98-a-0021 132.257000 144.015250 you know i mean one of the things that we talked about that i truly believe is you know you give somebody a you know a jury convicts somebody and they give them_1 a sixty year sentence and the guys going to be out in twelve or thirteen years you know
sw2535A-ms98-a-0022 144.015250 153.245250 yet the[y]- oh it's very wrong it's horrible you know i have i take a business law class um on Tuesday nights and my instructor is a practicing criminal attorney
sw2535A-ms98-a-0023 153.245250 165.081750 and you know so he does this like everyday you know deals with this and he said you know you could pretty much if you sit on a jury know right now you could be sure that they will serve just about a quarter of whatever you give them_1 you know
sw2535A-ms98-a-0024 165.081750 173.133125 well they they say we don't have enough room in the prisons and we've got to get them_1 out well if that's the case let's come up with some money somewhere
sw2535A-ms98-a-0025 173.133125 184.896750 to build some more and keep these people in i mean there was a thing on TV the other night where they were interviewing it wa[s]- it was a women's prison and they were interviewing these women and these women are li[ke]- [vocalized-noise] they asked them is this a deterrent and they all said no 
sw2535A-ms98-a-0026 184.896750 195.347125 i mean we're going to be out in a couple of years this is no big deal i mean this is like a little vacation we don't have to work we don't have to you know we don't have to worry about making a living we're you know we're fed and we're clothed and we're you know this is no big deal and 
sw2535A-ms98-a-0027 195.347125 206.346875 and you know they were asked you know well when you get out will you commit that same crime again and they said probably you know this is how we live that's how we make our living we live by selling drugs we live by stealing we live by this you know
sw2535A-ms98-a-0028 206.346875 214.668500 so obviously the system's not working you know an uh and i don't know what to do to make it work [laughter-and] so you know
sw2535A-ms98-a-0029 214.668500 220.823625 [silence]
sw2535A-ms98-a-0030 220.823625 222.564625 right

sw2535A-ms98-a-0035 238.877875 245.086750 oh that kind of wears off with time and people's outrage slowly goes away and you know
sw2535A-ms98-a-0036 245.086750 252.365250 no mine doesn't either but with specific yeah but with specific cases people bu[t]- you know the names aren't familiar anymore an[d]-

sw2535A-ms98-a-0058 390.367375 400.105875 and i guess if if we would as a country unite and sit down an[d]- and if Congress received a millions of letters in one week saying we're not going to take this anymore
sw2535A-ms98-a-0059 400.105875 412.413875 you either you know do away with some of these laws providing this or we're going to vote you out next time maybe something would happen you know but people don't get involved and don't sit down and do that so i don't know 
sw2535A-ms98-a-0060 412.413875 416.422000 yeah and just not pay any attention to it yeah

sw2535A-ms98-a-0074 479.844500 486.758125 and uh a bunch of kids came along and just started grabbing them_1 stealing them_1 i went running after them screaming hey you stop you stop i called the police
sw2535A-ms98-a-0075 486.758125 495.277500 you know i mean there was people that laughed at me they were Easter eggs Dana i called the police because i figured if these kids were stealing Easter eggs at ten 
sw2535A-ms98-a-0076 495.277500 500.580875 they're going to be stealing cars at sixteen and robbing houses at twenty one you know if it doesn't stop
sw2535A-ms98-a-0077 500.580875 502.116000 that's right
sw2535A-ms98-a-0078 502.116000 511.255250 these boys knew that what they were doing was wrong and when i screamed at them to stop they kept running they knew what they were doing was wrong that's why i called the police 
sw2535A-ms98-a-0079 511.255250 522.890500 to heck with them you know the police asked me if i wanted to press charges and i said no i'm not going to press charges i wanted the boys parents to know what had happened and i want you to go to talk to their parents and i want you know th[eir]- their parents to be aware
sw2535A-ms98-a-0080 522.890500 527.627500 [silence]
sw2535A-ms98-a-0081 527.627500 529.248750 well

sw2535A-ms98-a-0083 530.395250 543.367250 this is exactly what i told my mom you know when it was all over i said if we had a decent set of parents here those boys will be back here this afternoon with money to repay the eggs and with a big apology and nothing
sw2535A-ms98-a-0084 543.367250 556.496625 nothing the one girl the boys ran i couldn't keep up with them but the one girl was like carrying a two year old on her back and i was able to keep up with her and follow her until the police came you know so we would know who they were and her mother the police called her mother to come and pick them_1 up 
sw2535A-ms98-a-0085 556.496625 565.244000 and her mother had the same attitude as she as she did they were convinced that the absolute only reason i called the police was because she was black it had nothing to do with the fact that she stole from me
sw2535A-ms98-a-0086 565.244000 574.843875 and the little girl told me that the only reason you called the police is because i'm black and the little two year old sister she had with her she patted her on the leg and said see what happens when your black honey you'll live with this your whole life
sw2535A-ms98-a-0087 574.843875 575.322500 [noise]
sw2535A-ms98-a-0088 575.322500 586.422625 and i told her i said honey this has nothing to do with you being black i'd follow white kids that stole from me i mean stealing is stealing i don't care what color you are you think just because you're black you can steal and nobody's going to call the police that doesn't make any sense
sw2535A-ms98-a-0089 586.422625 600.033750 you know oh it was just horrible and then the mother's attitude the mother looked at me and goes well what is it that you want do you want me to pay you for your eggs or what you know it was that kind of attitude you know i mean it was just bad and i thought you know the parents went home and you know the ki[ds]-
