sw2513B-ms98-a-0005 21.795875 24.837000 [silence]

sw2513B-ms98-a-0007 29.516625 40.831875 you know refinished i don't know i don't understand the whole process my personally which is one reason why i don't trust the auto repairmen i guess uh these car repair places but uh
sw2513B-ms98-a-0008 40.831875 48.305125 i hate to take it anytime because i know they're going you know say oh you need this you need that and everything else in the book uh
sw2513B-ms98-a-0009 48.305125 60.219000 so i don't know [vocalized-noise] i haven't had a terribly good experience a lot of times with car repair places uh years ago when i was living in California i went to m[y]- my my my my clutch cable had popped on my car 
sw2513B-ms98-a-0010 60.219000 70.233500 the clutch had broken or something i don't know what was wrong so i took it to uh a transmission shop uh nationally recognized name and uh
sw2513B-ms98-a-0011 70.233500 71.903750 they had said uh
sw2513B-ms98-a-0012 71.903750 79.797750 well they he called me back that afternoon and they said oh yeah you need this you need that your transmission's faulty and all this and it was like you know six hundred dollars
sw2513B-ms98-a-0013 79.797750 90.930625 and i said wait the car's not worth that much it's it's uh an eight year old car and it's not worth that much uh i'll just have to do later i said i don't don't do anything with it because i'm i'm not worth that much money on it
sw2513B-ms98-a-0014 90.930625 98.476125 and i went there after work my wife and i went there after work and uh they had the whole thing down and taken apart
sw2513B-ms98-a-0015 98.476125 107.965250 so i told the guy i said you know i didn't authorize this i said you put it back together i'm taking it home and the guy said well it will have to be another day before we get it put back together [laughter] i started to go get a lawyer
sw2513B-ms98-a-0016 107.965250 119.146625 you know because i didn't authorize anything and so he went and got his manager and the manager came out and says i'll give you the parts at cost i'll give you the labor for a hundred dollars and so for two hundred fifty dollars we'll do it all for you [laughter]
sw2513B-ms98-a-0017 119.146625 128.562750 yeah so i thought well he'll meet me halfway i'll meet him halfway so i had it all all this work done for like two hundred and fifty dollars but still you know the the element of trust was gone at that point 
sw2513B-ms98-a-0018 128.562750 147.532750 [silence]
sw2513B-ms98-a-0019 147.532750 149.678750 yeah it was i'm sure it was
sw2513B-ms98-a-0020 149.678750 151.321375 so i got my
sw2513B-ms98-a-0021 151.321375 154.691500 uh transmission fixed with all my [laughter-clutch]
sw2513B-ms98-a-0022 154.691500 156.053250 um
sw2513B-ms98-a-0023 156.053250 167.046625 just the other day my clutch cable had had popped again and uh last year i- i took it my car to a friend of mine to have the oil changed he worked at a at a car lube place
sw2513B-ms98-a-0024 167.046625 177.817750 and uh i asked him if he could adjust the clutch any because it was kind of loose and he looked at it and said sure he pulled the clutch cable out from inside the engine area and
sw2513B-ms98-a-0025 177.817750 182.688250 pulled the clip out that was a[ttached]- attached to it and put it back further on on the cable well it was fine
sw2513B-ms98-a-0026 182.688250 189.815250 so i watched real carefully and and then [vocalized-noise] my clutch cable broke uh i went and uh i got a new uh
sw2513B-ms98-a-0027 189.815250 196.650750 clip that i had with me i bought an extra one and i just went there and and replaced it and was back moving again within three minutes 
sw2513B-ms98-a-0028 196.650750 205.967250 there i was stuck on the road right in the middle of traffic but i managed to get it going again relatively quickly because_1 i knew i watched what he did and was able to do it real really fast 
sw2513B-ms98-a-0029 205.967250 214.050375 and you know i just figured that if i'd taken it someplace they would have said oh you need a new clutch cable and this and that and you know two hundred fifty dollars later there it is you know [laughter]

sw2513B-ms98-a-0075 410.985500 416.790500 it just totally disengaged itself and you know of course then we had no way of of doing anything at that point
sw2513B-ms98-a-0076 416.790500 423.537750 we had to tow it home and uh and all that and it was like good grief and the car was new at that point it was only like a year or so old
sw2513B-ms98-a-0077 423.537750 425.060500 uh
sw2513B-ms98-a-0078 425.060500 435.504125 and uh other things were going out on it you know and these repair people say oh you need need your your your your your your this and your that's gone out and it's like good grief i don't even know what they do 
sw2513B-ms98-a-0079 435.504125 437.786250 so how am i supposed to trust them i don't know

sw2513B-ms98-a-0083 457.741500 462.383375 yeah [laughter] i was uh i had my car taken in uh 
sw2513B-ms98-a-0084 462.383375 466.989625 to have the oil changed at the the place across from the the TI plant in Lewisville
sw2513B-ms98-a-0085 466.989625 473.756250 and uh they told me he says oh your your belts are all worn out and they need to be redone uh
sw2513B-ms98-a-0086 473.756250 475.909375 it'd be like sixty dollars
sw2513B-ms98-a-0087 475.909375 489.992250 so i thought is that right i don't remember that having seen that they're that bad so i took it to a friend of mine's house and he looked at them_1 he took the belts off and looked at them and he says no they're not cracked or anything they're they're they're in pretty good condition all i had to do is tighten them a little bit they need little bit of tightening
sw2513B-ms98-a-0088 489.992250 493.044750 there's some belts that needed to be tightened 
sw2513B-ms98-a-0089 493.044750 498.094250 they you know they were kind of loose and so but these people were telling me that they needed to be replaced
sw2513B-ms98-a-0090 498.094250 499.882125 [laughter-so]

sw2513B-ms98-a-0093 511.169375 519.761625 uh every time my dad had taken his car in to be worked on and they did something with the belts and and they when they took the old belt off they cut it 
sw2513B-ms98-a-0094 519.761625 524.326750 and [vocalized-noise] like it's a standard deal easiest way to get it off and uh 
sw2513B-ms98-a-0095 524.326750 538.185375 they just let it hang where it was basically instead of just taking it off and throwing it away and when he got home he noticed some strange sounds [vocalized-noise] so he opened it up and looked in there and there was the old belt wrapped around one of the uh axle things in [laughter-there] 
sw2513B-ms98-a-0096 538.185375 546.082750 totally took him a half-hour to cut it off and [vocalized-noise] it totally engaged itself around the thing and boy was he he boy was he irate [laughter]
sw2513B-ms98-a-0097 546.082750 556.845625 which i don't blame him you know he'll i think he went back and showed it to them_1 and really chewed them_1 out for it [vocalized-noise] there's no excuse for that you know if your going to cut it off just grab it take it throw it away it's simple
sw2513B-ms98-a-0098 556.845625 558.682875 [silence]
