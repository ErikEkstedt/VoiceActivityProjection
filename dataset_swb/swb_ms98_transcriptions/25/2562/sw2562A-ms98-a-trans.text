sw2562A-ms98-a-0023 51.668125 60.099750 yeah i had a whole bunch of flowers and things well i don't have as many now we lived in the country for a long time and i had a whole bunch but
sw2562A-ms98-a-0024 60.099750 63.124125 now i work and i live in the city so
sw2562A-ms98-a-0025 63.124125 69.533000 that sort a kind of hung it up i have a few flowers but most of mine are like in barrels and things like that
sw2562A-ms98-a-0026 69.533000 73.612750 and this year i decided that well my husband made a little garden
sw2562A-ms98-a-0027 73.612750 80.698000 out there with the tomatoes and stuff in it but i decided that i don't like grass i don't like to have to have to pull grass
sw2562A-ms98-a-0028 80.698000 84.945000 so [laughter-i] decided that i would plant me a tomato plant in a flower pot
sw2562A-ms98-a-0029 84.945000 86.584750 to go see how it worked
sw2562A-ms98-a-0030 86.584750 89.657750 [noise] and mine looks real good [laughter]

sw2562A-ms98-a-0040 118.446375 124.549375 i had never thought about that i could probably plant one and bring it in and just like i bring my plants in every year
sw2562A-ms98-a-0041 124.549375 127.804250 that'd be neat well i got a patio and
sw2562A-ms98-a-0042 127.804250 137.583375 i tried to talk my husband into just buying a whole bunch of pots [laughter] and planting them_1 all in it you know because that's my favorite thing is tomatoes to grow
sw2562A-ms98-a-0043 137.583375 145.707875 and so um but he said no he was going to plant in the earth you know like he always has because he's always had a garden out in the country
sw2562A-ms98-a-0044 145.707875 151.433125 and i think he kind of misses it a little bit you know since we moved to the city but um
sw2562A-ms98-a-0045 151.433125 155.558250 i went ahead and planted one and mine looks better than his
sw2562A-ms98-a-0046 155.558250 156.586000 [silence]
sw2562A-ms98-a-0047 156.586000 160.802125 it does and then i like um you know what daylilies are

sw2562A-ms98-a-0052 169.899000 175.671750 no no hum-um these look like a lily they look like a um well they really look like an orchid
sw2562A-ms98-a-0053 175.671750 180.563625 when they come out uh-huh that what they look like but they only bloom for one day
sw2562A-ms98-a-0054 180.563625 194.498000 they'll um you'll have a bud the evening before and then the next morning as soon as the sun hits it it opens it starts opening up and then when it gets dark it closes and that's it it only blooms for one day
sw2562A-ms98-a-0055 194.498000 195.827875 [silence]
sw2562A-ms98-a-0056 195.827875 197.178250 uh-huh
sw2562A-ms98-a-0057 197.178250 199.601250 yeah but um
sw2562A-ms98-a-0058 199.601250 211.211000 they look like orchids is what they look like but they look like different color ones like i have uh yellow ones and i have red ones and i have purple ones and then they have like you know the real velvety looking stuff inside
sw2562A-ms98-a-0059 211.211000 215.191000 it it looks just like orchids in different colors that's what they look like
sw2562A-ms98-a-0060 215.191000 229.407125 they are they're beautiful uh i had a friend when i lived out in the country and she had belonged to this kind of society that like every year you know or every so many months they would send you different bulbs that they came out with
sw2562A-ms98-a-0061 229.407125 237.916125 and i mean they were real expensive they were like well the most expensive one that she gave me a bulb for was like thirty two fifty for one bulb
sw2562A-ms98-a-0062 237.916125 241.941625 so what she would do is she would plant them_1 and they multiplied
sw2562A-ms98-a-0063 241.941625 249.008500 so the next year when she you know weeded them_1 out so they wouldn't be as thick then she'd give me some of the bulbs [vocalized-noise]
sw2562A-ms98-a-0064 249.008500 254.287750 and i mean i have some of the most beautiful day lilies that you've ever seen
sw2562A-ms98-a-0065 254.287750 259.373125 so when we decided to move it was really funny because like i said i had a whole bunch of
sw2562A-ms98-a-0066 259.373125 264.958750 different kind of [laughter-things] and so i kept saying well i want to take a few of these and i want to take these and i want to take these
sw2562A-ms98-a-0067 264.958750 274.887500 my husband finally said look are we going to take the grass [laughter] can we leave the grass [laughter] i said yes we may leave that and i had a tree
sw2562A-ms98-a-0068 274.887500 282.266000 [laughter-yeah] and we had a tree that was like um seventeen foot tall or something like that and he said 
sw2562A-ms98-a-0069 282.266000 290.503000 no no i am not taking the tree you [laughter-know] i mean every time we went outside he'd he'd look at something that was humongous you know no we're not taking that
sw2562A-ms98-a-0070 290.503000 291.193625 [laughter]
sw2562A-ms98-a-0071 291.193625 296.556250 but the last day he said can't we leave the grass and i said yeah i think we will leave that [laughter]
sw2562A-ms98-a-0072 296.556250 309.392250 but um i brought um my kids when they were little they had given me uh some azaleas so i brought all my azalea bushes [laughter] and you know i brought i brought as much as i could bring
sw2562A-ms98-a-0073 309.392250 315.886375 without you know really tearing up their place but just like um you know the people that bought ours
sw2562A-ms98-a-0074 315.886375 325.254250 they bought the place but um i knew that they would you know if i left like one bulb of each one of them_1 by this year they'd have ten bulbs of each one of them_1
sw2562A-ms98-a-0075 325.254250 330.970500 so you know it wasn't like it was going to be this big raw place or something you know it would cover it right up
sw2562A-ms98-a-0076 330.970500 336.414250 but um i just couldn't see it you know going off and leaving everything like that
sw2562A-ms98-a-0077 336.414250 348.398500 because this house i really liked it and everything but the yard was a lot to be desired oh there was nothing i mean these people we have one ugly pine tree
sw2562A-ms98-a-0078 348.398500 351.436250 i mean and it is ugly
sw2562A-ms98-a-0079 351.436250 362.080000 i even tried making it look nicer you know i tied the yellow ribbon around it [noise] it was so ugly oh it did not help let me tell you i took it off and put it on my door i did not want to call attention
sw2562A-ms98-a-0080 362.080000 375.919375 [laughter-yeah] i mean it was terrible so really the plants that i brought over and put out here th[e]- are just about all i don't do any of the mowing or you know edging and all that my husband does all that stuff
sw2562A-ms98-a-0081 375.919375 378.446250 but that's because i'm allergic to the grass
sw2562A-ms98-a-0082 378.446250 381.411375 [silence]
sw2562A-ms98-a-0083 381.411375 386.211000 really now i like to go to the beach where the sand is because_1 then it doesn't make me ill
sw2562A-ms98-a-0084 386.211000 387.128750 [laughter]
sw2562A-ms98-a-0085 387.128750 398.898375 [silence]
sw2562A-ms98-a-0086 398.898375 411.108000 yeah i used to until it [vocalized-noise] i got so allergic to it i don't know if it's all [vocalized-noise] well i went and had some tests run and just about all the kinds i was allergic to but it's not as bad here
sw2562A-ms98-a-0087 411.108000 418.359500 um like Saint Augustine i think is what we have and it's not as bad as it was when we were out in the country
sw2562A-ms98-a-0088 418.359500 425.181625 but out in the country i mean if i went outside while he was mowing the grass i was going to have a gigantic attack
sw2562A-ms98-a-0089 425.181625 435.259125 so um i get shots for it now too that helps a whole bunch but one good thing about it see i don't have to mow the grass or [laughter] i mean that's really [laughter-nice]
sw2562A-ms98-a-0090 435.259125 436.560875 but
sw2562A-ms98-a-0091 436.560875 440.475875 [silence]
sw2562A-ms98-a-0092 440.475875 451.485500 um well the first thing we always plant is tomatoes i mean every year i don't care if we don't have anything else we're going to have tomatoes and then we plant cucumbers and um [vocalized-noise]
sw2562A-ms98-a-0093 451.485500 452.489000 [silence]
sw2562A-ms98-a-0094 452.489000 454.908500 oh yeah uh yeah
sw2562A-ms98-a-0095 454.908500 465.889750 [silence]
sw2562A-ms98-a-0096 465.889750 469.443750 really it must be the um at
sw2562A-ms98-a-0097 469.443750 473.969625 [silence]
sw2562A-ms98-a-0098 473.969625 478.030375 now that's i mean that's something that grows like a weed here
sw2562A-ms98-a-0099 478.030375 486.842750 i mean it grows like a weed we have to allow extra room for those because you know i mean extra space between the rows and all
sw2562A-ms98-a-0100 486.842750 497.725750 yes but i mean we usually get if we plant say one for every one plant we probably get fifty to sixty cucumbers off of it
sw2562A-ms98-a-0101 497.725750 507.794500 and i mean just pulling them_1 as fast as you can we usually give them to everybody anybody that wants a cucumber can have it but we tried it too where you run it up a fence
sw2562A-ms98-a-0102 507.794500 516.884625 and um [laughter-yeah] we had some weird cucumbers because_1 they grew inside the fence i mean like the little thing would be half on one side and half on the other
sw2562A-ms98-a-0103 516.884625 522.769375 and it i mean it was but w[e]- they're so heavy you know they get so heavy they kind of weigh it down but
sw2562A-ms98-a-0104 522.769375 526.288875 i mean [vocalized-noise] cucumbers here grow like crazy
sw2562A-ms98-a-0105 526.288875 529.626000 of course it's real hot here too you know [vocalized-noise]

sw2562A-ms98-a-0109 538.604875 549.857625 yeah yeah now if we have any like the birds will pick or something you know and and uh some of the seeds drop have you ever had them_1 just come up in different places from that
sw2562A-ms98-a-0110 549.857625 561.356125 i know we do that too you know and at the first year because_1 i was from the city when we got married and the first year that we planted i couldn't figure out i mean the well the first year after
sw2562A-ms98-a-0111 561.356125 565.204000 i mean we planted them but the first year you know after we'd had a crop
sw2562A-ms98-a-0112 565.204000 577.807250 all these little things like we had cucumbers coming up you know in the middle of our okra and i thought how did this get here i know i didn't put that seed there you know and it was weird but the birds had you know evidently just
sw2562A-ms98-a-0113 577.807250 579.944875 deposited them for us
