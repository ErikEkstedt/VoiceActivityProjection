sw2504B-ms98-a-0002 0.715125 3.658125 okay well um
sw2504B-ms98-a-0003 3.658125 9.177250 do you believe only fifty percent of the people actually vote
sw2504B-ms98-a-0004 9.177250 27.436625 [silence]
sw2504B-ms98-a-0005 27.436625 28.696500 well

sw2504B-ms98-a-0009 57.165375 69.499500 well it uh there's no question it does make a difference uh so far as having a party and then all voting uh when you have different precincts you would have to have a party in every precinct
sw2504B-ms98-a-0010 69.499500 73.403375 because people have to vote in different area
sw2504B-ms98-a-0011 73.403375 85.654375 and uh not everyone votes at the same place uh i personally think that we need to do more along the education lines in the schools to children from the little ones on up
sw2504B-ms98-a-0012 85.654375 95.173625 with the idea of the the value of voting and the purpose of voting and that one vote does make a difference but
sw2504B-ms98-a-0013 95.173625 96.192750 [silence]
sw2504B-ms98-a-0014 96.192750 98.586750 absolutely

sw2504B-ms98-a-0016 100.623375 102.133375 [silence]
sw2504B-ms98-a-0017 102.133375 114.081500 and and they are doing that in a number of schools however probably not enough of them uh country wide but it's going to take at least a whole generation of people uh to
sw2504B-ms98-a-0018 114.081500 123.275000 get across the idea of voting uh just like it's taking a whole generation of people to finally uh realize the harmfulness of drugs
sw2504B-ms98-a-0019 123.275000 138.045500 and uh hopefully to uh now with the many programs throughout the country on how to resist taking drugs how to say no to it and what have you that uh perhaps we'll finally get the youth
sw2504B-ms98-a-0020 138.045500 140.973500 weaned off of it but uh
sw2504B-ms98-a-0021 140.973500 152.742750 i know i i spent thirty four years in education here in the Dayton area and in nineteen fifty one the police were telling us about the drug dealers outside the school
sw2504B-ms98-a-0022 152.742750 159.639750 and how they were just giving away their marijuana giving away their heroin and what have you to get them started
sw2504B-ms98-a-0023 159.639750 167.723625 and now that was in fifty one that's forty years ago that it was already a problem so it's now uh
sw2504B-ms98-a-0024 167.723625 176.604000 to the forefront and people are finally taking some action against it and to think we've we've neglected the value of voting
sw2504B-ms98-a-0025 176.604000 187.995875 and uh and what it really means to vote and [noise] we also don't make the uh the issues perhaps in language that people fully understand them
sw2504B-ms98-a-0026 187.995875 194.469500 [silence]

sw2504B-ms98-a-0039 254.468625 257.977750 to complain about it right right
sw2504B-ms98-a-0040 257.977750 260.996000 [silence]
sw2504B-ms98-a-0041 260.996000 262.990250 that's right

sw2504B-ms98-a-0045 278.466625 279.749500 that is
sw2504B-ms98-a-0046 279.749500 291.496375 [silence]
sw2504B-ms98-a-0047 291.496375 294.973875 yes uh-huh
sw2504B-ms98-a-0048 294.973875 300.341125 yeah i it's the same way with everything in education though it should begin and
sw2504B-ms98-a-0049 300.341125 308.451250 right down in the first grade uh and your very best teachers in my estimation should be first second or third grade so that the children
sw2504B-ms98-a-0050 308.451250 320.280750 develop good learning patterns and have some success and want to go on learning and continue learning uh and not wait until they're in high school and then it's too late to try to change them around at that point
sw2504B-ms98-a-0051 320.280750 327.315000 but uh everything should be started on the lower levels and uh certainly if the youngsters had that opportunity that
sw2504B-ms98-a-0052 327.315000 336.728875 you know they they understood that the principles of the country were established so that everyone would have a say and everyone would have a vote
sw2504B-ms98-a-0053 336.728875 345.955250 and what that vote meant and uh but it but you're right from the standpoint that people do have a negative attitude towards politicians
sw2504B-ms98-a-0054 345.955250 354.999625 and perhaps it's because our campaigns have become so terribly expensive to run uh that only the most wealthy can do so
sw2504B-ms98-a-0055 354.999625 368.979500 and they're not always the best person for the job but they have the money to be able to do it so uh so that there are a lot of problems along that line also and perhaps the government
sw2504B-ms98-a-0056 368.979500 375.581000 [silence]
sw2504B-ms98-a-0057 375.581000 376.940250 sure
sw2504B-ms98-a-0058 376.940250 378.784625 [silence]
sw2504B-ms98-a-0059 378.784625 380.273500 right
sw2504B-ms98-a-0060 380.273500 388.740125 [silence]
sw2504B-ms98-a-0061 388.740125 390.478250 uh-huh
sw2504B-ms98-a-0062 390.478250 396.499375 [silence]
sw2504B-ms98-a-0063 396.499375 398.995625 yes
sw2504B-ms98-a-0064 398.995625 400.972625 [silence]
sw2504B-ms98-a-0065 400.972625 411.373125 right that's right and i think you know that's an excellent idea they for them to realize that that their going to have to do what someone else says even though they didn't vote for it
sw2504B-ms98-a-0066 411.373125 419.739000 and that maybe maybe to think twice about voting now some people object during primaries having to declare a party
sw2504B-ms98-a-0067 419.739000 430.348625 whether Republican or Democrat and you do that in the primary uh and i don't know that uh a lot of people vote in primaries for that very reason
sw2504B-ms98-a-0068 430.348625 441.374625 uh they can declare anything they want and they can actually rig it if they really wanted to vote Republican they could go in the primary and say they were voting Democrat and then stack the ballot
sw2504B-ms98-a-0069 441.374625 445.693125 for someone that perhaps the Republican could beat but uh
sw2504B-ms98-a-0070 445.693125 454.724625 it's uh it's just a sad situation and uh i do think more needs to be done along that line to help to uh
sw2504B-ms98-a-0071 454.724625 463.546875 teach the people uh uh everyone uh more about what is going on with voting and with non voting
sw2504B-ms98-a-0072 463.546875 471.999500 so that uh we can make so[me]- start making some more intelligent decisions and it's going to take these young you know it's going to take the uh
sw2504B-ms98-a-0073 471.999500 481.977750 a whole generation of my feeling uh before that's going to be accomplished that's right
sw2504B-ms98-a-0074 481.977750 493.461750 [silence]
