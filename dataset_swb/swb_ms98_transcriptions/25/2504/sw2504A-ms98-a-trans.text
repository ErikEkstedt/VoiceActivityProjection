sw2504A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.272750 okay
sw2504A-ms98-a-0002 1.272750 7.235000 [silence]
sw2504A-ms98-a-0003 7.235000 15.315125 i think it's somewhere really close to that cause i think a lot of people believe that their one little vote is not going to make that much difference
sw2504A-ms98-a-0004 15.315125 27.744250 and they really don't listen to any of the issues anymore because they feel like so many of the politicians are like crooked you know and so they figure why go out and vote you know they're going to do what they want to do they're corrupt anyway
sw2504A-ms98-a-0005 27.744250 38.795000 and i think one of the good ways of solving that is to like everybody likes to come to a party so have a voting party and uh you know like in communities
sw2504A-ms98-a-0006 38.795000 48.270125 and have the issues there and then everybody go vote together and then maybe come back over and have brunch or something i mean that's the only thing that i can figure out because
sw2504A-ms98-a-0007 48.270125 60.234875 i've heard so many people say well i'm not going on voting on that one you know i i'm going to go fishing today or it won't make any difference if if i don't vote [noise] and i think it does we vote every time
sw2504A-ms98-a-0008 60.234875 68.985750 [silence]
sw2504A-ms98-a-0009 68.985750 70.976125 right
sw2504A-ms98-a-0010 70.976125 92.948875 [silence]
sw2504A-ms98-a-0011 92.948875 104.992500 right and may[be]- maybe let them have some mock i mean uh you know elections and stuff and vote for different people in their classes and start really young that's a real good idea
sw2504A-ms98-a-0012 104.992500 123.141375 [silence]
sw2504A-ms98-a-0013 123.141375 124.552000 right
sw2504A-ms98-a-0014 124.552000 159.329750 [silence]
sw2504A-ms98-a-0015 159.329750 160.993250 um
sw2504A-ms98-a-0016 160.993250 162.996500 [silence]
sw2504A-ms98-a-0017 162.996500 164.982250 God
sw2504A-ms98-a-0018 164.982250 176.276125 [silence]
sw2504A-ms98-a-0019 176.276125 178.458625 right
sw2504A-ms98-a-0020 178.458625 186.750250 [silence]
sw2504A-ms98-a-0021 186.750250 190.790625 yeah well i don't know how it is up there but down here
sw2504A-ms98-a-0022 190.790625 202.499250 Louisiana has a bad reputation for their politicians and all i mean i'm sure you heard about some of ours and um people are just i mean it's like they're turned off on voting
sw2504A-ms98-a-0023 202.499250 214.884625 and that's the reason i said maybe if you had something like a block party okay we're going to have a block party everybody's going to get together we're going to discuss the different issues and stuff and then we're going to go and vote you know we're going to go vote like
sw2504A-ms98-a-0024 214.884625 227.658000 maybe they could give something like uh the top neighborhood if you had a hundred percent in your neighborhood or something like that you know i mean it doesn't have to be it could be like a a sign that they would put down at the end of your block 
sw2504A-ms98-a-0025 227.658000 229.797750 you know or anything like that but
sw2504A-ms98-a-0026 229.797750 242.324875 it it's really bad here i mean to me it is it seems like people just don't care anymore they say huh well it don't make any difference you know one crook is as good as the other one and they don't bother to listen to what any of them have to say
sw2504A-ms98-a-0027 242.324875 246.973875 and um i know my husband now we go vote every time i don't care how
sw2504A-ms98-a-0028 246.973875 256.483875 small the ballot is i mean if there's one thing if there's one issue because the way i feel is if i don't vote then i don't have any reason to gripe
sw2504A-ms98-a-0029 256.483875 262.257875 right and i hear so many people saying well i wish this would change i wish that and you know but they didn't go vote
sw2504A-ms98-a-0030 262.257875 271.499250 and uh maybe if they like you said if they would start when little kids and start letting them vote and learn how to vote and all
sw2504A-ms98-a-0031 271.499250 278.950375 then uh and the importance of it because okay if you don't vote for your friend over here well your friend's not going to have a chance
sw2504A-ms98-a-0032 278.950375 286.044000 he needs your vote just like he needs everybody elses you know maybe if they were brought up that a way like you said it would
sw2504A-ms98-a-0033 286.044000 296.999375 because i know here uh until you get into high school now then they had the voting machines and you voted for like cheerleaders and different things like that but they should start that a lot earlier

sw2504A-ms98-a-0047 366.971625 372.678875 you know a good i- idea for the young kids like that too is to have like a
sw2504A-ms98-a-0048 372.678875 382.214125 a mock one and okay this this candidate tells you some things that are going to happen and this candidate tells you some things okay then this percentage of the
sw2504A-ms98-a-0049 382.214125 394.845500 voters i mean the kids in that class they are not going to let them vote this time but they have to do whatever these people whichever one the other people elect do if they did something like that and started kids out real young and showed them
sw2504A-ms98-a-0050 394.845500 403.751125 okay now you're not going to get to vote but you're going to have to do what that person says they would understand probably by the time they were in high school they'd be ready to vote
sw2504A-ms98-a-0051 403.751125 411.750000 [silence]
sw2504A-ms98-a-0052 411.750000 413.725250 yeah

sw2504A-ms98-a-0058 463.870000 465.504000 yeah
sw2504A-ms98-a-0059 465.504000 468.700125 [silence]
sw2504A-ms98-a-0060 468.700125 471.234000 i think that sounds great
sw2504A-ms98-a-0061 471.234000 476.490000 [silence]
sw2504A-ms98-a-0062 476.490000 485.244000 well you know they'd have to start when they're real young i mean you know it would have to be a child that is just coming in the school
sw2504A-ms98-a-0063 485.244000 488.968125 because i- well i'll tell you another thing too now whenever
sw2504A-ms98-a-0064 488.968125 499.919625 the first time i voted i never voted in high school because there was never anyone that showed us how to use the voting machines now this sounds dumb but i did not know how to use those voting machines
sw2504A-ms98-a-0065 499.919625 504.450000 and nobody ever showed us or anything so i didn't vote because
sw2504A-ms98-a-0066 504.450000 511.799875 anybody that went in there and they asked a question all the other kids laughed at them they thought that was funny oh she don't even know how [vocalized-noise]
sw2504A-ms98-a-0067 511.799875 523.210500 so there wasn't any way i was going to go in there and vote and it took me i mean it took such courage you [laughter-wouldn't] believe to go vote the first time because i was waiting for somebody to laugh at me because i didn't know how to work the machines
sw2504A-ms98-a-0068 523.210500 529.011250 now that's bad and i mean i was out of school i was a married person and um
sw2504A-ms98-a-0069 529.011250 541.271500 i didn't know how to work the machine you know and it really scared me really bad because i thought all these people are going to laugh at me because i don't know how to work this machine where if they'd if they'd had a class or something or just a short
sw2504A-ms98-a-0070 541.271500 544.410125 time you know th[at]- that okay this is the way 
sw2504A-ms98-a-0071 544.410125 553.356500 right it's this is the way it's going to be and my son was exactly the same way that i was and i didn't realize it until uh his senior year
sw2504A-ms98-a-0072 553.356500 565.851250 i s[aid]- asked him something about well did you who did you vote for for uh cheerleader and he said oh i didn't go vote he said uh there's no way i'm getting in that machine well then i realized it so when we went and voted the next time i asked
sw2504A-ms98-a-0073 565.851250 569.257375 the uh lady i said i want my son to come in with me
sw2504A-ms98-a-0074 569.257375 581.989750 and she said well uh why you know he'll have to come back out i said because i want him to know how to use one of these and i said i won't turn any of the buttons down but i want to show him how to use it so that he'll be able to vote
sw2504A-ms98-a-0075 581.989750 587.634375 and uh so he went in and now he's a registered voter but he would not vote before that
sw2504A-ms98-a-0076 587.634375 597.823875 and i mean i think that's bad you know here i was and and even of course there's a lot of years between the two of us but even with that many years between the
