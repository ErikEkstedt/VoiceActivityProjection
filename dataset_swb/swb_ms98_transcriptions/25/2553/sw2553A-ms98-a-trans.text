sw2553A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.444500 [noise]
sw2553A-ms98-a-0002 0.444500 2.644250 well what's your thoughts on it
sw2553A-ms98-a-0003 2.644250 16.640500 [silence]
sw2553A-ms98-a-0004 16.640500 29.176000 um that's it that's that's the primary that and the loosening of the restrictions letting them ease up on their cash reserves and uh like you say all these bad real estate loans and energy loans
sw2553A-ms98-a-0005 29.176000 39.379500 [noise] um you know i i it's hard to say what caused it i mean you know if if the regulations hadn't been uh
sw2553A-ms98-a-0006 39.379500 44.794500 hadn't been relaxed maybe it wouldn't have happened but i somehow think it still would have
sw2553A-ms98-a-0007 44.794500 54.773125 you go in you start making massive investments in those two areas and you're you're just playing the market you know they were just gambling with their their savers' money
sw2553A-ms98-a-0008 54.773125 59.364750 then of course then of course there was the fraud but you're going to have that anywhere so
sw2553A-ms98-a-0009 59.364750 70.834750 [silence]
sw2553A-ms98-a-0010 70.834750 72.540125 yeah
sw2553A-ms98-a-0011 72.540125 76.164875 well so are they are they handling it right
sw2553A-ms98-a-0012 76.164875 78.394250 gee who knows [laughter]
sw2553A-ms98-a-0013 78.394250 80.925500 i don't don't even know if they know
sw2553A-ms98-a-0014 80.925500 90.111000 [silence]
sw2553A-ms98-a-0015 90.111000 91.399625 yeah
sw2553A-ms98-a-0016 91.399625 94.952750 [silence]
sw2553A-ms98-a-0017 94.952750 98.824375 yeah i that that's the part of it i couldn't understand i mean
sw2553A-ms98-a-0018 98.824375 113.556375 i i wonder if there's not a little bit of overzealousness there uh you know they say well this one went under because of bad energy loans bad real estate loans and then they go around classifying everybody as bad when in fact there are some very good
sw2553A-ms98-a-0019 113.556375 127.482625 loans out there i mean not all real estate loans are bad you know the greatest majority of them are people who own their homes so you know those aren't exactly what you'd call bad [noise] i
sw2553A-ms98-a-0020 127.482625 134.362625 [silence]
sw2553A-ms98-a-0021 134.362625 139.032750 uh-huh yeah that exactly
sw2553A-ms98-a-0022 139.032750 141.627875 [silence]
sw2553A-ms98-a-0023 141.627875 142.920375 yeah
sw2553A-ms98-a-0024 142.920375 143.953125 [silence]
sw2553A-ms98-a-0025 143.953125 145.361000 yeah
sw2553A-ms98-a-0026 145.361000 147.449125 yeah the
sw2553A-ms98-a-0027 147.449125 151.945750 yeah and and that's nothing more than speculation i mean they they
sw2553A-ms98-a-0028 151.945750 158.765250 yeah it it seems that there should have been something in the regulations saying they couldn't do that i know banks can't do it
sw2553A-ms98-a-0029 158.765250 166.721000 uh back when i used to play the commodities market i i tried to go to the bank to get a loan to buy gold and silver futures and they wouldn't let me
sw2553A-ms98-a-0030 166.721000 176.489750 [silence]
sw2553A-ms98-a-0031 176.489750 177.833250 yeah
sw2553A-ms98-a-0032 177.833250 180.995000 [silence]
sw2553A-ms98-a-0033 180.995000 182.396625 yeah
sw2553A-ms98-a-0034 182.396625 185.741125 [silence]
sw2553A-ms98-a-0035 185.741125 187.308875 really
sw2553A-ms98-a-0036 187.308875 188.643625 [silence]
sw2553A-ms98-a-0037 188.643625 190.272625 and the and
sw2553A-ms98-a-0038 190.272625 191.559125 and then it
sw2553A-ms98-a-0039 191.559125 192.685750 [silence]
sw2553A-ms98-a-0040 192.685750 194.259500 yeah
sw2553A-ms98-a-0041 194.259500 196.624500 [silence]
sw2553A-ms98-a-0042 196.624500 203.746250 yeah and then and then some some rich yo-yo walks in there who's buddies with the bank president saying look i want to borrow
sw2553A-ms98-a-0043 203.746250 210.962875 seven hundred thousand dollars so i can invest in this oil well they say oh sure no problem you're a good customer
sw2553A-ms98-a-0044 210.962875 221.590875 yeah i i uh i run i run a little business on the side out of my home and i tried to uh get set up with my bank to accept MasterCard and Visa
sw2553A-ms98-a-0045 221.590875 229.532500 you would think i was asking for an appointment with the president you know and basically what it came down to is they weren't going to let me have it
sw2553A-ms98-a-0046 229.532500 239.001125 um they frown on home business they uh they they insist that you have a storefront
sw2553A-ms98-a-0047 239.001125 251.973750 and that's just ludicrous i mean i mean the way things are going people are more and more working out of their homes i know a lot of people who do lawyers doctors uh architects consultants
sw2553A-ms98-a-0048 251.973750 261.309500 they they work in their home there's no reason for them to have an office they they have very little customer contact and when they do they go to the customer
sw2553A-ms98-a-0049 261.309500 272.499750 so i mean [vocalized-noise] you know what's the story on them you know are you going to let them have it well of course they're going to get it you know all you've got to do is have a nice big bank account balance and they'll give it to you
sw2553A-ms98-a-0050 272.499750 277.069375 [silence]
sw2553A-ms98-a-0051 277.069375 279.703750 uh mail order primarily
sw2553A-ms98-a-0052 279.703750 285.252000 me and my uh me and my roomie who's also my partner um
sw2553A-ms98-a-0053 285.252000 294.794250 well we lump everything under this business i mean we do just about everything he's into the computer end of things he does consulting and graphics design and
sw2553A-ms98-a-0054 294.794250 309.309375 oh systems design i mean you name it he does that and then i handle the mail order and whatever else we do we do cat breeding [laughter] [laughter-i] [laughter-mean] [laughter-yeah] it's all lumped under the business
sw2553A-ms98-a-0055 309.309375 317.195375 um [laughter-yeah] [laughter] make a few bucks here and there on that
sw2553A-ms98-a-0056 317.195375 330.040875 but um we're we're there's several ways of getting set up to take MasterCard and Visa uh there's several banks out there the smaller banks who are trying to break into the market
sw2553A-ms98-a-0057 330.040875 334.866875 and they will take the risk on a home business um
sw2553A-ms98-a-0058 334.866875 348.037875 there's i m[ade]- i made a few contacts through CompuServe um talking about you know hey we're brokers for these banks you know it you don't pay us anything the bank pays us and
sw2553A-ms98-a-0059 348.037875 352.241000 of course what you're dealing with is some somewhat higher costs
sw2553A-ms98-a-0060 352.241000 356.985375 like a two hundred and fifty dollar nonrefundable application fee
sw2553A-ms98-a-0061 356.985375 363.165875 uh so if the bank turns you down well that's it you're out two hundred and fifty bucks [laughter] 
sw2553A-ms98-a-0062 363.165875 370.073250 no i i'm i'm i'm leery of it i know that's the way it works um
sw2553A-ms98-a-0063 370.073250 381.491000 but and as long as you can meet their requirements there there's very little chance they'll turn you down and they do have some requirements like you have to be registered with the State and you have to have
sw2553A-ms98-a-0064 381.491000 396.451250 a business address and you have to have a business phone line and then you have to have a separate line for their equipment that kind of stuff uh but if you meet all those chances are they'll approve you so we're looking at that 
sw2553A-ms98-a-0065 396.451250 403.715125 it's just it's just hard to give somebody two hundred and fifty bucks on a chance you know [laughter] 
sw2553A-ms98-a-0066 403.715125 406.537000 [silence]
sw2553A-ms98-a-0067 406.537000 409.572375 yeah what what business do you do
sw2553A-ms98-a-0068 409.572375 410.988500 yeah
sw2553A-ms98-a-0069 410.988500 416.851750 yeah my uh my roomie is down in Charlotte right now he's got an internship down at IBM
sw2553A-ms98-a-0070 416.851750 420.722375 so business has sort of come to a standstill
sw2553A-ms98-a-0071 420.722375 422.831500 [silence]
sw2553A-ms98-a-0072 422.831500 425.713250 yeah he's at uh he's at NC State
sw2553A-ms98-a-0073 425.713250 428.568000 [silence]

sw2553A-ms98-a-0081 446.675000 451.688625 [silence]

sw2553A-ms98-a-0083 457.916750 464.197375 and he signed up for it and then of course he moved off to Charlotte so now i'm stuck making his calls too [laughter]
sw2553A-ms98-a-0084 464.197375 464.495750 [noise]
sw2553A-ms98-a-0085 464.495750 467.304875 [laughter]
