sw2547B-ms98-a-0007 14.215875 17.224375 so i own a home in Pensacola
sw2547B-ms98-a-0008 17.224375 22.930000 and uh let's see we are to compare homes correct
sw2547B-ms98-a-0009 22.930000 24.764375 uh
sw2547B-ms98-a-0010 24.764375 34.090625 my home is well is typical for the area i live in a development uh it's a relatively i would say

sw2547B-ms98-a-0012 36.133875 42.415750 oh well God it sounds like [laughter] sounds like i'm bragging [laughter]
sw2547B-ms98-a-0013 42.415750 47.639875 no it's upper middle class uh kind of an environment it's a
sw2547B-ms98-a-0014 47.639875 49.149625 two

sw2547B-ms98-a-0016 50.603750 53.581500 colonial which my wife and i designed
sw2547B-ms98-a-0017 53.581500 57.004250 uh it has around thirty two hundred square feet
sw2547B-ms98-a-0018 57.004250 58.440000 [laughter]

sw2547B-ms98-a-0021 63.968250 68.519750 and it is i would imagine in terms of
sw2547B-ms98-a-0022 68.519750 73.636250 of size and so forth it's relatively typical for the area it might be
sw2547B-ms98-a-0023 73.636250 81.635625 i would say it's probably midsized for the area there are some smaller and there are s[everal]- you know several larger
sw2547B-ms98-a-0024 81.635625 84.093000 and uh
sw2547B-ms98-a-0025 84.093000 85.396625 but i[n]-
sw2547B-ms98-a-0026 85.396625 91.827250 based you know in terms of you know in in Pensacola in that area of Florida
sw2547B-ms98-a-0027 91.827250 94.311500 it uh
sw2547B-ms98-a-0028 94.311500 97.480000 it's what now it is uh

sw2547B-ms98-a-0035 105.137750 107.469750 and so it's
sw2547B-ms98-a-0036 107.469750 111.959125 in terms of cost and an[d]- and size and so forth it uh
sw2547B-ms98-a-0037 111.959125 113.370750 [silence]
sw2547B-ms98-a-0038 113.370750 121.079125 the hou[se]- you know housing there is extremely affordable and uh compared to other parts of the country you know let's say compared to Maryland
sw2547B-ms98-a-0039 121.079125 127.204250 that same house here would probably cost three quarters [laughter-of] a [laughter-million] [laughter-dollars] but [laughter]

sw2547B-ms98-a-0043 135.692500 139.923875 it was it ran around a hundred and forty thousand dollars
sw2547B-ms98-a-0044 139.923875 145.665125 so i- i would have really i haven't really priced you know in the market so i

sw2547B-ms98-a-0058 198.742125 206.095750 it's really is a buyer's market there now and it isn't because of the well there is been a lot of speculative building
sw2547B-ms98-a-0059 206.095750 218.371000 uh i don't know perhaps not in Dallas but uh i'm sure people in uh you know in uh Galveston and so forth would be knowledgeable about it uh Pensacola is a Navy town
sw2547B-ms98-a-0060 218.371000 224.233250 and home porting was a possibility a few years ago
sw2547B-ms98-a-0061 224.233250 227.184000 they were expecting an influx of
sw2547B-ms98-a-0062 227.184000 234.605000 something on the order of fifty thousand people or more from the Navy [vocalized-noise] a new carrier was coming in and uh
sw2547B-ms98-a-0063 234.605000 238.891500 the uh attendant uh support vessels well that's no longer
sw2547B-ms98-a-0064 238.891500 240.592250 the case
sw2547B-ms98-a-0065 240.592250 246.627125 oh it's it is i mean the the number of single family units on sale
sw2547B-ms98-a-0066 246.627125 249.788875 is phenomenal compared to the population
sw2547B-ms98-a-0067 249.788875 254.399250 and so uh overbuilding is i[t]- it has been a real problem there
sw2547B-ms98-a-0068 254.399250 262.404750 so you can still get a get a a g[ood]- good house for a very very reasonable price and i mean good i would let's say typical
sw2547B-ms98-a-0069 262.404750 266.342875 [noise] say three bedroom uh two and a half baths
sw2547B-ms98-a-0070 266.342875 270.371375 on a half acre or so of land uh

sw2547B-ms98-a-0072 272.680000 277.660625 [noise] reasonable construction would probably run you uh
sw2547B-ms98-a-0073 277.660625 280.038125 right now anywhere between
sw2547B-ms98-a-0074 280.038125 284.522250 somewhere between a hundred and a hundred and forty thousand dollars
sw2547B-ms98-a-0075 284.522250 287.895375 and prob[ably]- perhaps cheaper depending upon the neighborhood so
sw2547B-ms98-a-0076 287.895375 289.619125 what about your home

sw2547B-ms98-a-0094 367.541125 370.295000 twelve miles or so from the
sw2547B-ms98-a-0095 370.295000 374.282125 uh border of Washington DC
sw2547B-ms98-a-0096 374.282125 380.475250 and Montgomery County Maryland is probably one of the most expensive
sw2547B-ms98-a-0097 380.475250 382.116500 places to
sw2547B-ms98-a-0098 382.116500 385.050375 [silence]
sw2547B-ms98-a-0099 385.050375 392.964125 no we are west Sevren is East near the Eastern Shore if i had

sw2547B-ms98-a-0106 421.609875 428.721500 well that's that area over there is not as expensive as in the the immediate you know Washington area
sw2547B-ms98-a-0107 428.721500 432.014250 and so we uh
sw2547B-ms98-a-0108 432.014250 435.743250 i was just looking for example there is a uh
sw2547B-ms98-a-0109 435.743250 446.062750 condominium complex next to the apartment complex where i live and i was over there recently looking at the possibility of buying a two bedroom condominium
sw2547B-ms98-a-0110 446.062750 448.543500 and
sw2547B-ms98-a-0111 448.543500 451.903250 ninety two thousand dollars
sw2547B-ms98-a-0112 451.903250 455.615625 for two bedroom which is essentially a two bedroom apartment
sw2547B-ms98-a-0113 455.615625 458.063750 now it was very nicely done
sw2547B-ms98-a-0114 458.063750 459.854125 [vocalized-noise]
sw2547B-ms98-a-0115 459.854125 465.481000 yes i- i can't i can't envision spending that much money uh and 
sw2547B-ms98-a-0116 465.481000 471.635125 on on something along those lines so you know it's y[ou]- i guess you pay the piper but
sw2547B-ms98-a-0117 471.635125 477.079000 plus the the the phe[nomenal]- taxes around here are phenomenally high uh
sw2547B-ms98-a-0118 477.079000 485.411750 uh for the and so you on that it's not unusual for example for somewhere around here on a on an on a
sw2547B-ms98-a-0119 485.411750 493.879875 what we would you know what you described as your house and what i would describe as my house say for example in Pensacola Florida on that house 
sw2547B-ms98-a-0120 493.879875 497.796250 with the homestead exemption and so forth and so on
sw2547B-ms98-a-0121 497.796250 505.095250 might pay three or four hundred dollars a year taxes may[be]- maybe you know maybe a little bit higher than that now
sw2547B-ms98-a-0122 505.095250 509.218750 but that same house here you'd pay almost six thousand dollars a year taxes on it
sw2547B-ms98-a-0123 509.218750 510.446375 [laughter]
sw2547B-ms98-a-0124 510.446375 513.102375 so it's uh
sw2547B-ms98-a-0125 513.102375 517.794500 so the question of whether to buy here or move to another county say drive
sw2547B-ms98-a-0126 517.794500 526.306875 twenty more miles north buy a condominium for approximately uh the same price maybe a little lower
sw2547B-ms98-a-0127 526.306875 529.208500 but the taxes would be you know
sw2547B-ms98-a-0128 529.208500 533.626750 perhaps maybe one third uh of
sw2547B-ms98-a-0129 533.626750 535.327250 oh absolutely
sw2547B-ms98-a-0130 535.327250 537.126125 you know so
sw2547B-ms98-a-0131 537.126125 540.008000 it's it's really sad [laughter]
sw2547B-ms98-a-0132 540.008000 543.862375 this is one this is one of the most highly taxed areas in the country
sw2547B-ms98-a-0133 543.862375 546.910750 [silence]
sw2547B-ms98-a-0134 546.910750 550.027625 well they i[t]- uh

sw2547B-ms98-a-0136 551.359250 559.820750 the their they do have an extremely good such things as extremely good school systems for example it has one of the best school systems in the country
sw2547B-ms98-a-0137 559.820750 569.789000 uh and because the cost of living around here is so high public employees make great salaries [laughter-around] here
sw2547B-ms98-a-0138 569.789000 576.377000 i was reading just recently where the typical administrator in the Montgomery County
sw2547B-ms98-a-0139 576.377000 579.460125 Public Schools makes
sw2547B-ms98-a-0140 579.460125 580.467500 [silence]
sw2547B-ms98-a-0141 580.467500 585.349125 a[nd]- an[d]- and i'm not this is uh the figure he makes eighty thousand dollars a year
sw2547B-ms98-a-0142 585.349125 596.743875 that's and i by administrator i- i think i mean i they didn't they did not define it but for example a curriculum supervisor or principal or
sw2547B-ms98-a-0143 596.743875 600.139125 someone you know in that uh in that range
