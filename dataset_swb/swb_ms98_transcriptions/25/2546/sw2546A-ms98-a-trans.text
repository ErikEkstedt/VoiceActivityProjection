sw2546A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.616750 [noise]
sw2546A-ms98-a-0002 0.616750 5.819000 i guess i don['t]- don't really have a problem with capital punishment i'm not really sure what
sw2546A-ms98-a-0003 5.819000 14.787000 the exact uh specifications are for Texas i know that they uh have capital punishment for certain crimes and that's probably the way i feel about it is
sw2546A-ms98-a-0004 14.787000 21.406625 is uh it kind of depends on the crime that's committed my belief all my life i guess has been that
sw2546A-ms98-a-0005 21.406625 27.693500 that if you take someone else's life then you automatically are giving up uh yours in place of it
sw2546A-ms98-a-0006 27.693500 31.349625 but i don't seems to be a lot of controversy about that
sw2546A-ms98-a-0007 31.349625 33.389125 [noise]
sw2546A-ms98-a-0008 33.389125 72.287125 [silence]
sw2546A-ms98-a-0009 72.287125 80.650750 that's true i guess [noise] well there's there's probably two or three different types of of views as far as the controversy goes i can see where
sw2546A-ms98-a-0010 80.650750 89.316250 if a life was taken by accident or uh [noise] i don't know what you'd call it not premeditated or i guess primarily by accident
sw2546A-ms98-a-0011 89.316250 94.123750 uh there may be cases where the death penalty is not called for
sw2546A-ms98-a-0012 94.123750 98.818250 but i lean towards if it's premeditated or if it's uh
sw2546A-ms98-a-0013 98.818250 107.898500 kind of a habitual or or a habit that uh a tendency that people uh may get into then i guess i don't really have a problem with it
sw2546A-ms98-a-0014 107.898500 144.053125 [silence]
sw2546A-ms98-a-0015 144.053125 145.262875 yeah
sw2546A-ms98-a-0016 145.262875 158.408125 yeah i think that's what aggravates a lot of people is somebody does get a life sentence in place of the death penalty and they wind up back on the streets after five years or six years or like the kid on the news tonight out in Mesquite who was out in six months
sw2546A-ms98-a-0017 158.408125 189.575250 [silence]
sw2546A-ms98-a-0018 189.575250 190.930125 no

sw2546A-ms98-a-0020 208.076375 209.287625 right
sw2546A-ms98-a-0021 209.287625 217.431375 [silence]
sw2546A-ms98-a-0022 217.431375 227.912750 no it's not you think of your chances of getting the death penalty after [cre/committing] uh committing a crime are really pretty slim right now and you can probably spend uh a lot of time
sw2546A-ms98-a-0023 227.912750 240.074250 [noise] uh or maybe eventually uh just waiting it out and that's where a lot of aggravation comes i think is is uh these guys spend so much time in the appeal process or just in the waiting process they may spend years
sw2546A-ms98-a-0024 240.074250 247.164250 and you know the last i heard it was costing ten twenty thirty thousand dollars a year uh to keep these guys waiting
sw2546A-ms98-a-0025 247.164250 265.110125 [silence]
sw2546A-ms98-a-0026 265.110125 266.364625 yeah

sw2546A-ms98-a-0028 289.628125 294.562500 to yeah to carry it out it sort of takes the justice out of the justice system
sw2546A-ms98-a-0029 294.562500 308.462375 [silence]
sw2546A-ms98-a-0030 308.462375 309.664250 yeah

sw2546A-ms98-a-0039 340.469625 348.914250 and you know the like you say the cops that are out doing the work a day by day have got to have a lot of frustration when they see all their work basically go out the window 
sw2546A-ms98-a-0040 348.914250 363.060250 [silence]
sw2546A-ms98-a-0041 363.060250 364.769125 yes they are
