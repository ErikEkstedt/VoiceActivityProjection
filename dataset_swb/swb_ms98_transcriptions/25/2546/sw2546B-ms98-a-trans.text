sw2546B-ms98-a-0002 1.031250 31.614000 [silence]
sw2546B-ms98-a-0003 31.614000 38.784875 yeah uh uh i tend to agree with you uh you know probably pretty similar views on it but that's
sw2546B-ms98-a-0004 38.784875 48.794250 that's one of the things i don't don't understand is is so much of the controversy because uh you know i- i do also myself believe in capital punishment uh
sw2546B-ms98-a-0005 48.794250 60.425875 uh you know it it really irks me to see so much effort put into preventing someone being put to death by the State when they
sw2546B-ms98-a-0006 60.425875 72.600375 so callously and usually so you know without even thinking or without any concern uh you know end somebody else's life and in a lot of cases several people's lives
sw2546B-ms98-a-0007 72.600375 94.920500 [silence]
sw2546B-ms98-a-0008 94.920500 96.206500 oh is that
sw2546B-ms98-a-0009 96.206500 107.513375 [silence]
sw2546B-ms98-a-0010 107.513375 112.031125 yeah that's that's kind of the way i feel i[f]- if you've got a guy who's
sw2546B-ms98-a-0011 112.031125 125.040875 who's been to trial and has been in and out of jail you know basically a a three time loser for the twelfth time you know and he goes out and kills somebody he's not going to be reformed he's not going to get any better you know it's it's not going a
sw2546B-ms98-a-0012 125.040875 130.966375 it's just not going to get any better and and the only thing you know a lot of people have the opinion that
sw2546B-ms98-a-0013 130.966375 145.617250 you know don't don't have capital punishment but give them_1 life in jail and you know i could go along with that if if i could be assured that it would be their natural life in jail and not parole after ten or twelve years
sw2546B-ms98-a-0014 145.617250 157.724375 [silence]
sw2546B-ms98-a-0015 157.724375 160.880375 um-hum yeah it's it's just
sw2546B-ms98-a-0016 160.880375 168.516875 our criminal system is just so i guess overloaded but the you know the the problem is not
sw2546B-ms98-a-0017 168.516875 180.102750 so much with the prison system you know i mean because the the cops are out there doing their job enforcing the laws and the prison system are just you know they're trying to cope with them but
sw2546B-ms98-a-0018 180.102750 191.261500 you know the thing about capital punishment i- i you know a lot of people don't think it would be a deterrent uh to to future crime and the way it is now it's not because you know you
sw2546B-ms98-a-0019 191.261500 195.572875 if the like the State of Texas for example may
sw2546B-ms98-a-0020 195.572875 210.037500 uh you know may execute somebody twice a year you know that's that's no kind of deterrent because we we've got literally hundreds of people on death row and and many of them who have been there for literally for ten or fifteen years on death row and that's
sw2546B-ms98-a-0021 210.037500 217.957000 that's certainly no kind of deterrent and i would tend to agree with anybody who says right now that it it's not a deterr[ent]- uh a deterrent because it's not
sw2546B-ms98-a-0022 217.957000 224.617000 [silence]
sw2546B-ms98-a-0023 224.617000 226.337375 oh yeah

sw2546B-ms98-a-0030 246.250750 256.668125 yeah it it's amazing there's uh there's a girl i work with our secretary as a matter of fact her her father was murdered her father and three other guys up here in Sherman
sw2546B-ms98-a-0031 256.668125 265.772125 and the uh the guy that they tried and convicted and sentenced him to death you know he's been on death row for like eight years
sw2546B-ms98-a-0032 265.772125 276.439750 and you know this this was her father uh you know that that got killed you know just cold-blooded murder him and three other people and but still
sw2546B-ms98-a-0033 276.439750 291.437875 for some reason you know this this guy's sentence has not been carried out you know he's sitting on death row for eight years after having killed four people and the State still can't bring itself to to ex[ecute]- execute this guy
sw2546B-ms98-a-0034 291.437875 293.643625 [silence]
sw2546B-ms98-a-0035 293.643625 304.088875 it does it really does you know she and they have to go back uh occasionally you know she has to write letters to the parole board and you know lawyers and
sw2546B-ms98-a-0036 304.088875 311.566875 just just ever so often she mentions well she's got to do something else you know write another letter or do something it's just
sw2546B-ms98-a-0037 311.566875 318.805125 yeah yeah you know she should be getting on with her life you know getting getting that part behind her but yet
sw2546B-ms98-a-0038 318.805125 323.203625 it's it's kind of tied to her the way it is now
sw2546B-ms98-a-0039 323.203625 325.325125 [silence]
sw2546B-ms98-a-0040 325.325125 337.997125 yeah [vocalized-noise] yeah right a victim not only of uh indirectly of the crime but also indirectly by that indirect involvement it's just it's it's ridiculous 
sw2546B-ms98-a-0041 337.997125 340.843875 yeah yeah it it's terrible you know and
sw2546B-ms98-a-0042 340.843875 343.519750 [silence]

sw2546B-ms98-a-0045 347.019375 357.381375 oh that oh man i- i couldn't be a cop for that for that very reason you know because they do the the criminal gets right back out and you know the cop's just got to go back and
sw2546B-ms98-a-0046 357.381375 365.219250 and do his thing all over again because so many of the crimes are are done by repeat offenders it's
