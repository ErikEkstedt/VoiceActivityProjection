sw2569A-ms98-a-0023 80.706125 83.070250 [silence]
sw2569A-ms98-a-0024 83.070250 94.951125 well you know you know mine did and it was late at this time last year i held out no hope for it but i watered and fertilized the hell out of it and i by July and August it was as strong and thick as it had ever been
sw2569A-ms98-a-0025 94.951125 108.606250 and uh and of course this year it never really died out that much i mean this year here it is only April and it's looking good yeah we had we had a mild winter we you know everybody in my neighborhood hires their yard work done and i think i think the fun of owning a house is doing the yard work
sw2569A-ms98-a-0026 108.606250 123.000000 and i mean i thought so i've owned a house for um twenty five of the of the thirty two years that i've been here in Dallas and i just enjoy it so much and uh and and particularly the lawn i love it d[ark]- i love to see it get a deep dark green
sw2569A-ms98-a-0027 123.000000 136.821375 i love to uh i l[ove]- i love to mow it i don't like weeding the flower beds around the house and my son's supposed to do that but pretty every once and a while they get ahead of him [laughter] so i end up doing that for him and and my wife sometimes takes care of the flowers 
sw2569A-ms98-a-0028 136.821375 140.674750 and so between us we got all our own little things to do
sw2569A-ms98-a-0029 140.674750 153.490000 and we go[t]- we got two girls off in college they don't do anything but uh i uh and i love to be out in the summertime i love to be out when the sun is really nice and hot and just go out there and sweat a bit mowing the lawn
sw2569A-ms98-a-0030 153.490000 162.318625 i just love it in fact i uh mow my lawn but there's a gigantic vacant field in back of us uh that belongs to Richland College
sw2569A-ms98-a-0031 162.318625 173.487375 and everybody that we have that backs up to it mows about uh oh maybe ten or fifteen or twenty yards into the vacant lot to keep weeds from growing and coming over and seeding in your yard
sw2569A-ms98-a-0032 173.487375 179.867000 so so we all even get more uh get more lawn to mow that way but uh it's fun
sw2569A-ms98-a-0033 179.867000 189.498750 uh i am on the east side of Richland in fact so Richland's on my west side when i look out my back door to see the sun set i look across the Richland field
sw2569A-ms98-a-0034 189.498750 192.362375 [laughter-okay] and 
sw2569A-ms98-a-0035 192.362375 201.058250 [silence]
sw2569A-ms98-a-0036 201.058250 203.629250 okay i i live on Wharton Drive
sw2569A-ms98-a-0037 203.629250 209.071125 and Wharton intersects uh uh it dead ends into Chimney Hill
sw2569A-ms98-a-0038 209.071125 216.974625 and and then it it dead ends just dead ends up here where i live [laughter] it runs uh it runs north and south from Chimney Hill north 
sw2569A-ms98-a-0039 216.974625 223.461250 uh anyway i love to do that and the other thing that i love is that i am a distance runner by hobby
sw2569A-ms98-a-0040 223.461250 232.876625 and some nights i'll come home from work like i did last night and with rain in the forecast and the lawn was getting pretty high i said i got to mow the lawn but i want to go out and run now which do i do first
sw2569A-ms98-a-0041 232.876625 240.737875 and i'm sitting around thinking well if i go out and run now because i messed around until almost sev[en]- uh six thirty or so if i go out and run now
sw2569A-ms98-a-0042 240.737875 246.782875 i'm going to get back and i'm going to be mowing the lawn and it's going to get dark and i'm going to have to guess where where the [laughter-line] [laughter-is] to [laughter-mow] 
sw2569A-ms98-a-0043 246.782875 252.203250 so if i mow now then i'll go out and run afterwards and what the mowing does it limbers you up
sw2569A-ms98-a-0044 252.203250 265.752375 so that you go out and have a good run i finished up right at about dark and then i went out and ran four and a half miles and it was great just because the mowing it i- i don't i didn't i don't have to do any stretching before running if i've been pushing the lawn mower around for an hour for an hour and ten minutes or so
sw2569A-ms98-a-0045 265.752375 276.486750 so that's just you know i just i i i just really enjoy it and i hate to he[re]- see people gripe and moan about doing uh yard work uh what about trees do you have any trees around 
sw2569A-ms98-a-0046 276.486750 278.946750 [silence]

sw2569A-ms98-a-0059 330.509000 342.756375 yeah yeah i got i got so carried away with water and fertilizer last year in uh June July and the first part of August i was mowing every four days [laughter] and i talked to my parents i'm from Massachusetts originally
sw2569A-ms98-a-0060 342.756375 350.562875 and i talked to my parents on the phone i said you know we Texans are a funny breed we we wa[ter]- we water we spend
sw2569A-ms98-a-0061 350.562875 362.411750 hundreds of dollars a month during the dry part of July August watering our lawn we go out and spend thirty or forty dollars a whack on fertilizer and then we bitch and gripe about having to [laughter-mow] it so often [laughter]
sw2569A-ms98-a-0062 362.411750 369.196250 we said because we Massachusetters weren't like that we never did anything to it except mow it and and it always looked nice
sw2569A-ms98-a-0063 369.196250 382.392625 yeah we didn't do all that stuff here but they get more natural rain than we do you know we get so much rain in the spring and then we go sometimes entire June July and August without any uh so i guess we're where are you from originally 
sw2569A-ms98-a-0064 382.392625 383.589625 [silence]

sw2569A-ms98-a-0072 429.618875 434.061250 [silence]
sw2569A-ms98-a-0073 434.061250 435.753750 yeah

sw2569A-ms98-a-0076 440.447125 441.558500 [silence]
sw2569A-ms98-a-0077 441.558500 442.856375 yeah
sw2569A-ms98-a-0078 442.856375 444.123375 [silence]
sw2569A-ms98-a-0079 444.123375 453.453875 uh i- yeah that's true that's true we did we did and uh do you all do you all uh do you all have to water a lot over there
sw2569A-ms98-a-0080 453.453875 460.824625 [silence]
sw2569A-ms98-a-0081 460.824625 475.690500 oh yeah because of the foundation problem you know that's an interesting thing i've had two overseas assignments with TI uh i was in uh Malaysia eighty one eighty two eighty three and eighty four and i was in the Philippines eighty five eighty six and eighty seven and i had two different tenants
sw2569A-ms98-a-0082 475.690500 488.574750 and my first one kept the inside of the house nice this is a two story five bedroom and uh uh they only lived in the downstairs because he was divorced and had two children and they only visited him one weekend a month
sw2569A-ms98-a-0083 488.574750 498.382125 and [vocalized-noise] that was the only time the upstairs wa[s]- so the upstairs looked as new as we left it uh they all lived downstairs uh and and his wife was an interior decorator and the house was just kept 
sw2569A-ms98-a-0084 498.382125 512.862750 very nice you know i've i've heard horror stories from other TIers that have had tenants but he didn't like yard work and what happened was the Saint Augustine grew up you know if you don't watch it and keep it trimmed back it will totally take over your flower beds
sw2569A-ms98-a-0085 512.862750 524.802500 well when we came back what used to be our flower [laughter-beds] [laughter-were] [laughter-solid] [laughter-Saint] [laughter-Augustine] [laughter-we] [laughter-had] [laughter-to] we had to dig it out [laughter] and the second tenant when we went to the Philippines the second tenant he had two little girls 
sw2569A-ms98-a-0086 524.802500 538.983000 and so they lived throughout the entire house he also had a dog in the house that i didn't know about and so our carpeting was in bad shape when i got back but uh my yard was immaculate he did a great job on the yard so you so i guess you can't have everything
sw2569A-ms98-a-0087 538.983000 551.838875 but but but you're right and i guess that's very important because of this black earth with have here that cracks terribly uh and it shifts badly in the summertime that uh if you don't water around the foundation you're going to lose it 
sw2569A-ms98-a-0088 551.838875 564.831000 and uh and boy i'll tell you you've really got to have a conscientious tenant and it's hard for him to be conscientious when he's thinking of paying a hundred dollar water bill uh every uh uh i- you know every month when you get into the June July and August time period
sw2569A-ms98-a-0089 564.831000 567.430750 and how how big is your duplex
sw2569A-ms98-a-0090 567.430750 569.861250 [silence]
