sw2586B-ms98-a-0002 1.996250 8.498875 oh yeah my dad has a lake cabin and so we go there for the small lake uh
sw2586B-ms98-a-0003 8.498875 19.498000 just outside of the Dallas Fort Worth area it takes us about three hours to get there and we go and we fish and we catch a bunch of junk [laughter] nothing nothing to talk about for the most part but it's fun
sw2586B-ms98-a-0004 19.498000 21.109625 [silence]
sw2586B-ms98-a-0005 21.109625 23.197250 from the dock from shore

sw2586B-ms98-a-0007 26.670000 41.661125 oh mostly we catch carp if we're doing good we catch a catfish or two once in a while and you know we go ahead and eat those but we've never caught enough to really have what you'd call a fish fry what we normally do is just uh go ahead and clean it up and then uh
sw2586B-ms98-a-0008 41.661125 54.522625 you know put it in a bag and freeze it and and somebody takes it home and eats it then when there's just a couple people instead of a whole crowd usually there's a pretty good crowd there [laughter-so] we don't ever catch enough to eat carp is usually pretty much fun
sw2586B-ms98-a-0009 54.522625 64.028625 because i've caught up to about an eight pound carp on a little you know a little pole with twenty pound test line and that that's a pretty good fight so that's a lot of fun
sw2586B-ms98-a-0010 64.028625 65.708375 yeah
sw2586B-ms98-a-0011 65.708375 67.938500 they fight hard

sw2586B-ms98-a-0039 149.985000 153.101875 so you're fishing downstream so it will carry some

sw2586B-ms98-a-0060 211.158500 216.230500 did someone just come up with this design and and you're going to make one for yourself or are you going to buy it

sw2586B-ms98-a-0067 229.999375 239.735250 [laughter] i guess so we tend to use just bait and a few lures but bait tends to work the best just some blood bait
sw2586B-ms98-a-0068 239.735250 244.050000 oh are you where are you from oh i'm from Midland
sw2586B-ms98-a-0069 244.050000 249.221875 i went to college at Tech so you've been out to Buffalo Gap fishing
sw2586B-ms98-a-0070 249.221875 251.612000 yeah i've been up there

sw2586B-ms98-a-0076 276.178000 281.314750 just from the heat of it all that's one advantage you've certainly got on us
sw2586B-ms98-a-0077 281.314750 284.554875 [silence]
sw2586B-ms98-a-0078 284.554875 294.708125 it does i've only been up there once in the summer well no i've been up there twice in the summer but both times it was really pleasant in fact it snowed on us in in

sw2586B-ms98-a-0109 389.950500 401.736000 his big thing last year was throwing it in the water and reeling it up [laughter] that was what he considered fishing [laughter] this year he's gotten to where he can we we were at a friend's uh stock pond were out at their farm 
sw2586B-ms98-a-0110 401.736000 411.379375 and and they had been fishing and let him use the pole while we wal[ked]- we all walked off a healthy hundred yards or so and let him fish and he started trying to cast it
sw2586B-ms98-a-0111 411.379375 415.320125 so he he was kind of getting there but [laughter] he
sw2586B-ms98-a-0112 415.320125 423.981000 he's at a dangerous point [laughter-right] [laughter-now] he understands the mechanics of pushing the button and throw but not necessarily the direction it's going to go in
sw2586B-ms98-a-0113 423.981000 425.032125 [silence]
sw2586B-ms98-a-0114 425.032125 426.595375 yeah

sw2586B-ms98-a-0120 452.706125 459.994125 well yeah but TI is up there so [laughter] that part of it would probably work out
sw2586B-ms98-a-0121 459.994125 462.762000 i'm sorry what
sw2586B-ms98-a-0122 462.762000 467.539375 we're both uh i was uh military but he's division three
sw2586B-ms98-a-0123 467.539375 472.316750 it goes back and forth Division well maybe division one right now he's in computers
sw2586B-ms98-a-0124 472.316750 479.420625 so and he's in school and everything else uh-huh i have some friends who work up there
sw2586B-ms98-a-0125 479.420625 481.543500 Kathy and Kevin Guy
sw2586B-ms98-a-0126 481.543500 490.632750 yeah and they like to fish they've been inviting us to come up there in the summer her dad has a cabin and they go fishing up there
sw2586B-ms98-a-0127 490.632750 494.076125 so that would be neat to try it some time
sw2586B-ms98-a-0128 494.076125 504.073000 [silence]
sw2586B-ms98-a-0129 504.073000 508.407125 yeah long as you have a good time that's the main point so

sw2586B-ms98-a-0137 528.797875 536.392000 yeah the only thing you've got to watch is when that creek comes up we camped next to one one time when we were there a couple of summers ago
sw2586B-ms98-a-0138 536.392000 547.104625 and we figured we were up a long way off and then it rained that night and we thought well wonder how far off we are and we got up the next day and that creek that had been fifty or sixty feet from our site of our tent was now about
sw2586B-ms98-a-0139 547.104625 555.596250 three feet [laughter-away] [laughter] and it's like oh well [laughter] maybe we ought to move just a touch so that was kind of funny
sw2586B-ms98-a-0140 555.596250 559.175750 [silence]
sw2586B-ms98-a-0141 559.175750 571.337875 yeah i just love the way it looks i could almost just watch the wa[ter]- we in fact we have gotten out on [vocalized-noise] on trips before and just stopped and watched it because there was so much and if you were there i mean it was
sw2586B-ms98-a-0142 571.337875 585.306375 one time we were there and i guess it was late May so it was really your spring almost you know at even though it was it was really summer down here and and the i guess the creek the mountains were really starting to melt and the creek was just wild just running
sw2586B-ms98-a-0143 585.306375 590.614750 and and all the white water and noise and the it was just beautiful
sw2586B-ms98-a-0144 590.614750 592.695125 [silence]
sw2586B-ms98-a-0145 592.695125 593.849750 uh-huh
