sw2528A-ms98-a-0055 192.377250 194.636875 professional wrestling it seems like it's just
sw2528A-ms98-a-0056 194.636875 198.803375 just just like pros in a wrestling to me i don't i don't see any difference though
sw2528A-ms98-a-0057 198.803375 203.617375 i i don't understand it they consider it violent i have so ever i have seen it on
sw2528A-ms98-a-0058 203.617375 206.045250 where we are i live in uh Rochester New York
sw2528A-ms98-a-0059 206.045250 207.211375 and i think a
sw2528A-ms98-a-0060 207.211375 208.414375 yes

sw2528A-ms98-a-0066 222.354375 223.470250 [silence]
sw2528A-ms98-a-0067 223.470250 225.756375 Sunday afternoons actually around here
sw2528A-ms98-a-0068 225.756375 227.528375 as well sometimes
sw2528A-ms98-a-0069 227.528375 230.046375 i think it's been on i think i've seen it during the day
sw2528A-ms98-a-0070 230.046375 232.477125 i know i've seen it during the day in Florida
sw2528A-ms98-a-0071 232.477125 234.448500 when i was at my parents down there
sw2528A-ms98-a-0072 234.448500 239.176750 definitely seen it do[ne]- on on during the day down there and i don't think it's a very violent show i think it's funny
sw2528A-ms98-a-0073 239.176750 242.352750 i think it's a real good concept i think it's something completely new
sw2528A-ms98-a-0074 242.352750 248.474625 [silence]
sw2528A-ms98-a-0075 248.474625 251.027250 [laughter]

sw2528A-ms98-a-0079 256.550250 260.357375 yeah i think so i think because people sort of get through you know um
sw2528A-ms98-a-0080 260.357375 264.774500 i think that people sort of learn the importance of sort of physical
sw2528A-ms98-a-0081 264.774500 267.400750 fitness as well as the
sw2528A-ms98-a-0082 267.400750 272.202250 as well as you know some mental fitness and i think that people sort of learn good sportsmanship and so forth
sw2528A-ms98-a-0083 272.202250 288.010375 [silence]
sw2528A-ms98-a-0084 288.010375 291.016125 well don't they take people who have some sort of

sw2528A-ms98-a-0086 292.257875 303.252250 big abilities like and and at least they used to when it when it the first ones i saw they had um a man on who was uh he played college football and almost went pro and they had a
sw2528A-ms98-a-0087 303.252250 316.745250 a woman who was a black belt in karate and she was the uh she was in the junior Olympics or something or they seem to have people who have very very big sports backgrounds to have they lea[ned]- leaned away from that sort of
sw2528A-ms98-a-0088 316.745250 333.833375 [silence]
sw2528A-ms98-a-0089 333.833375 336.229625 oh that's how they do it

sw2528A-ms98-a-0098 367.715125 371.471125 um what what do they win they they win money i think don't they
sw2528A-ms98-a-0099 371.471125 375.097625 [silence]
sw2528A-ms98-a-0100 375.097625 376.406875 really

sw2528A-ms98-a-0138 479.622250 484.704750 um eleven o'clock here and i think they put it like eleven o'clock
sw2528A-ms98-a-0139 484.704750 494.361125 um California time like in California but in the middle they sort of um like central time or mountain time they they push things back
sw2528A-ms98-a-0140 494.361125 500.211500 so i was actually actually i'm not sure i was in i was in Iowa awhile ago and noticed that everything was an hour earlier
sw2528A-ms98-a-0141 500.211500 502.964125 so does your prime time start at seven o'clock
sw2528A-ms98-a-0142 502.964125 508.034750 [silence]
sw2528A-ms98-a-0143 508.034750 511.809125 wait no no not not even the news but do they have like um
sw2528A-ms98-a-0144 511.809125 515.591500 do like sort of all the regular sitcoms and so forth start at seven o'clock
sw2528A-ms98-a-0145 515.591500 516.779250 [silence]
sw2528A-ms98-a-0146 516.779250 522.394500 you so like you know the regular television shows that are that are very popular do they start at seven or or at eight
sw2528A-ms98-a-0147 522.394500 534.213625 [silence]
sw2528A-ms98-a-0148 534.213625 536.821125 right because that would actually start at eight o'clock here
sw2528A-ms98-a-0149 536.821125 538.133500 [silence]
sw2528A-ms98-a-0150 538.133500 541.124375 yeah that that would all start at at um
sw2528A-ms98-a-0151 541.124375 544.166250 that would all start at at
sw2528A-ms98-a-0152 544.166250 547.029625 eight o'clock here that wouldn't start at seven
sw2528A-ms98-a-0153 547.029625 550.450125 we have um at seven o'clock we just have
sw2528A-ms98-a-0154 550.450125 556.009625 um the they'll play you know they have old reruns of Cheers or something
sw2528A-ms98-a-0155 556.009625 560.095750 from seven to seven thirty and then something else from seven thirty to eight but then at
sw2528A-ms98-a-0156 560.095750 562.375625 at eight o'clock is when everything starts
sw2528A-ms98-a-0157 562.375625 563.297875 [silence]
sw2528A-ms98-a-0158 563.297875 564.278875 which is 
sw2528A-ms98-a-0159 564.278875 567.829375 which is strange i mean because yours start at seven and end at ten and ours start at 
sw2528A-ms98-a-0160 567.829375 575.233500 at at at at eight and end at eleven that's why we [vocalized-noise] i i would actually like it better if everything started at seven and ended at ten
