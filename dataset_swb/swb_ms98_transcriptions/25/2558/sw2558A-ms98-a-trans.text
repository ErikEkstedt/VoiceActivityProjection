sw2558A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 5.248875 what do you think about the uh Peace Corps or public service commitment
sw2558A-ms98-a-0002 5.248875 10.772250 [silence]
sw2558A-ms98-a-0003 10.772250 21.999750 well i think it was uh thought up when there was so much controversy about reviving a draft and people said well they uh young people who were drafted have to
sw2558A-ms98-a-0004 21.999750 26.915500 provide military service to the country but there are an awful lot of young people who would
sw2558A-ms98-a-0005 26.915500 34.624125 benefit from um some sort of public service like the Conservation Corps back in the thirties or
sw2558A-ms98-a-0006 34.624125 43.799875 uh various other things of that sort and it seems to me that it's it's not a totally bad idea but i don't quite see how they'd make it work
sw2558A-ms98-a-0007 43.799875 52.492500 how would they decide who goes into uh building fire breaks in Yosemite National Park and who goes to Saudi Arabia
sw2558A-ms98-a-0008 52.492500 76.160000 [silence]
sw2558A-ms98-a-0009 76.160000 88.099750 yeah the the difficulty would be in whether it's voluntary or involuntary and the people who were proposing it said that it should be involuntary that it should be like a draft
sw2558A-ms98-a-0010 88.099750 101.205500 and some people would get military service and some people would get civilian uh service like working in hospitals this i assume it's the kinds of things that they had conscientious objectors do
sw2558A-ms98-a-0011 101.205500 113.637500 when people were drafted and they refused to serve in the Army they were allowed to do hospital service or uh things like that and if they re[fuse]- or farm work in World War One i remember
sw2558A-ms98-a-0012 113.637500 123.435625 uh reading about and and i suppose that there is uh justification for taking everybody if you take anybody
sw2558A-ms98-a-0013 123.435625 135.161000 but i just really think that the difficulties involved in paying them uh sorting them out assigning them training them would be insurmountable
sw2558A-ms98-a-0014 135.161000 139.135750 [silence]
sw2558A-ms98-a-0015 139.135750 140.155125 yeah
sw2558A-ms98-a-0016 140.155125 142.737875 well [laughter] it's a possibility
sw2558A-ms98-a-0017 142.737875 150.307375 [silence]
sw2558A-ms98-a-0018 150.307375 156.636375 well i think that in the in the cases that like that uh they had to be
sw2558A-ms98-a-0019 156.636375 167.099500 uh pretty thoroughly examined to prove that they had pacifist and religious beliefs and so forth and that this wasn't something new just to keep out of going to war it was
sw2558A-ms98-a-0020 167.099500 171.916875 uh something that was a fundamental part of their philosophy of life
sw2558A-ms98-a-0021 171.916875 178.652875 [silence]
sw2558A-ms98-a-0022 178.652875 180.157125 oh yeah
sw2558A-ms98-a-0023 180.157125 182.277250 [silence]
sw2558A-ms98-a-0024 182.277250 187.639500 sure and in addition to that we have the cost because you have to pay something
sw2558A-ms98-a-0025 187.639500 199.001000 for their room and board and then you have to pay them some kind of a stipend uh even if it's like the Peace Corps where they don't get most of it until they come home you have t[o]- have to pay them something
sw2558A-ms98-a-0026 199.001000 200.056875 [silence]
sw2558A-ms98-a-0027 200.056875 201.471750 oh yeah
sw2558A-ms98-a-0028 201.471750 202.496750 [silence]
sw2558A-ms98-a-0029 202.496750 209.368375 yeah now i had a lot of friends who went to the Peace Corps uh back in the mid sixties
sw2558A-ms98-a-0030 209.368375 220.297500 and it really did seem to be a worthwhile organization but on the other hand i'm not sure what the permanent value of it was i don't know what we got for all the money
sw2558A-ms98-a-0031 220.297500 231.153375 we had an awful lot of idealistic people who went off to uh what was then East Pakistan is now Bangladesh and to uh Algeria and to
sw2558A-ms98-a-0032 231.153375 244.799375 uh Southeast Asia and lots of uh out of the way places but i don't know if they really had significant effects in the places where they went in teaching the people how to cope with their lives better
sw2558A-ms98-a-0033 244.799375 250.519625 [silence]
sw2558A-ms98-a-0034 250.519625 252.036375 uh-huh
sw2558A-ms98-a-0035 252.036375 259.168000 [silence]
sw2558A-ms98-a-0036 259.168000 260.511625 uh-huh
sw2558A-ms98-a-0037 260.511625 271.254750 [silence]
sw2558A-ms98-a-0038 271.254750 273.235125 sure
sw2558A-ms98-a-0039 273.235125 280.047250 and it was definitely voluntary too they were not drafting you and sending you against your will
sw2558A-ms98-a-0040 280.047250 282.048500 [silence]
sw2558A-ms98-a-0041 282.048500 287.628000 yeah well what about a voluntary program do you think that would be a good idea
sw2558A-ms98-a-0042 287.628000 306.822875 [silence]
sw2558A-ms98-a-0043 306.822875 308.369500 i don't either
sw2558A-ms98-a-0044 308.369500 312.972750 [silence]
sw2558A-ms98-a-0045 312.972750 324.436375 yeah out here in California there's a program like that for uh juvenile delinquents the the ones that are not dangerous and they don't have to be locked up go to these uh camps
sw2558A-ms98-a-0046 324.436375 335.217000 and they do forestry work they maintain trails and they uh put up signs and they do fire prevention work and certainly things of that sort
sw2558A-ms98-a-0047 335.217000 345.330250 and that i know is run by the State but there may be other things i'm not so sure what kind of uh training that is for the future for those kids
sw2558A-ms98-a-0048 345.330250 356.050250 it's probably a a very good way to keep them off the streets and out of trouble but whether it's something that they can put to to economic use later on is a different subject
sw2558A-ms98-a-0049 356.050250 363.977625 [silence]
sw2558A-ms98-a-0050 363.977625 367.522625 that's true [laughter] good point [laughter]
sw2558A-ms98-a-0051 367.522625 368.054000 [laughter]
sw2558A-ms98-a-0052 368.054000 369.444750 oh
sw2558A-ms98-a-0053 369.444750 371.671625 [silence]
sw2558A-ms98-a-0054 371.671625 378.498250 yeah yeah i'm sorry i'm going to have to go but my other line is blinking but it was good to talk to you
sw2558A-ms98-a-0055 378.498250 379.680250 bye
sw2558A-ms98-a-0056 379.680250 381.883625 [noise]
