sw2521A-ms98-a-0026 57.002750 65.127000 well the it the the NFL draft really seems to be doing its job because got teams like
sw2521A-ms98-a-0027 65.127000 77.553625 like Buffalo who weren't certainly weren't a powerhouse uh ten years ago now they've been able to get some good players and come around and th[e]- New Orleans the same story and uh
sw2521A-ms98-a-0028 77.553625 82.550125 and uh a few years ago Denver was a powerhouse and then they uh
sw2521A-ms98-a-0029 82.550125 95.196375 they weren't getting the draft picks and now the uh other team so it seems to be uh moving around and uh to to New Orleans benefit and uh you see how look at the Cowboys now they're uh they're hurting
sw2521A-ms98-a-0030 95.196375 96.591625 and uh

sw2521A-ms98-a-0036 111.433750 121.649000 doesn't give you much respect for their team at all any t[eam]- any team that tha[t]- where the owner would fire Tom Landry you know is like one of the greatest coaches of all time
sw2521A-ms98-a-0037 121.649000 130.284625 and just because they had had a couple of bad seasons and you can't even attribute those bad seasons to bad coaching

sw2521A-ms98-a-0042 153.302875 165.220000 you know he'd uh never seem to be able to keep his guys healthy and then even like uh what is it Eric Dickerson left the team you know tha[t]- you're right you know like people were jumping ship right and left
sw2521A-ms98-a-0043 165.220000 172.421125 and i don't know that sounds t[o]- to me more like the front office problem than coaching problem but then the team was sold

sw2521A-ms98-a-0100 340.163125 352.840375 yeah Buffalo's lucky though to have uh Jim Kelly then now he's the number one rated quarterback in the NFL i think i'm pretty sure he was this past season and uh
sw2521A-ms98-a-0101 352.840375 354.742625 then with uh
sw2521A-ms98-a-0102 354.742625 368.922750 uh the defense with Bruce Smi[th]- Bruce Smith there at linebacker there they've got a very well rounded team and it seems that they've gotten over their bickering and their fighting as they problems they had in the past and now they're uh
sw2521A-ms98-a-0103 368.922750 373.117000 really playing as a goo[d]- good together as a team
sw2521A-ms98-a-0104 373.117000 374.484625 so

sw2521A-ms98-a-0110 397.237375 403.241250 ac[tually]- i i'd have to confess i don't really scope out the New Orleans games per say
sw2521A-ms98-a-0111 403.241250 408.995375 New Orleans just isn't isn't one of the areas i've lived in so many places i've lived in uh
sw2521A-ms98-a-0112 408.995375 411.880000 Denver but i don't like the Broncos there's
sw2521A-ms98-a-0113 411.880000 414.807000 no love for the Broncos but i've lived in uh

sw2521A-ms98-a-0115 425.904375 440.779875 uh and i lived in Detroit too so i like uh first of all first and foremost the Bills games i want to see and then i'll uh normally check out the Eagles or the Patriots and Patriots were so depressing this last year that
sw2521A-ms98-a-0116 440.779875 444.142500 yeah that uh i kind of gave up on them
sw2521A-ms98-a-0117 444.142500 446.152875 but uh
sw2521A-ms98-a-0118 446.152875 455.367000 first and foremost the Bills i even wen[t]- i went to got to go to a Bills game this year which was fun it was the the Bills Eagles game which appropriately enough
