sw2521B-ms98-a-0008 11.836250 12.400875 [noise]
sw2521B-ms98-a-0009 12.400875 16.016125 yeah i think they are because they're getting better every year
sw2521B-ms98-a-0010 16.016125 18.007125 and uh they got a lot
sw2521B-ms98-a-0011 18.007125 19.628750 [silence]
sw2521B-ms98-a-0012 19.628750 21.122250 i don't think so
sw2521B-ms98-a-0013 21.122250 22.783000 we went to the play-offs
sw2521B-ms98-a-0014 22.783000 24.832250 yeah [laughter]
sw2521B-ms98-a-0015 24.832250 27.035500 [silence]
sw2521B-ms98-a-0016 27.035500 29.055750 yeah now i like them_1 too
sw2521B-ms98-a-0017 29.055750 34.032375 [silence]
sw2521B-ms98-a-0018 34.032375 37.671875 they are they are doing a whole bunch better who's their quarterback
sw2521B-ms98-a-0019 37.671875 39.477000 who's their quarterback
sw2521B-ms98-a-0020 39.477000 49.193375 yeah yeah i like to watch them too they're the i like to watch almost all the football but um of course i watch every Saints game that i can watch
sw2521B-ms98-a-0021 49.193375 54.943500 but i think they're going to i think they're really going to do good because it seems like they're finally all coming together
sw2521B-ms98-a-0022 54.943500 57.325125 if they would just quit blowing it
sw2521B-ms98-a-0023 57.325125 90.347500 [silence]
sw2521B-ms98-a-0024 90.347500 91.520125 yeah
sw2521B-ms98-a-0025 91.520125 94.473000 [silence]
sw2521B-ms98-a-0026 94.473000 95.781250 um-hum
sw2521B-ms98-a-0027 95.781250 97.006250 really bad
sw2521B-ms98-a-0028 97.006250 104.111125 but they got so much bad publicity too and i think that hurt a lot of you know people even wanting to play on their team
sw2521B-ms98-a-0029 104.111125 120.846375 [silence]
sw2521B-ms98-a-0030 120.846375 122.466375 right right
sw2521B-ms98-a-0031 122.466375 129.978500 [silence]
sw2521B-ms98-a-0032 129.978500 144.413000 yeah yeah because all the problems i mean if you think about those years that we had the losing season of how bad i mean his players were constantly getting kicked off the team because of drugs because of uh
sw2521B-ms98-a-0033 144.413000 149.199125 you know messing with young children and i mean it was just one thing it seemed like right after the other
sw2521B-ms98-a-0034 149.199125 150.430000 with them
sw2521B-ms98-a-0035 150.430000 152.405625 [silence]
sw2521B-ms98-a-0036 152.405625 153.668750 yeah
sw2521B-ms98-a-0037 153.668750 160.560500 [silence]
sw2521B-ms98-a-0038 160.560500 161.837625 um-hum
sw2521B-ms98-a-0039 161.837625 165.076000 [silence]
sw2521B-ms98-a-0040 165.076000 166.387000 right
sw2521B-ms98-a-0041 166.387000 172.100375 [silence]
sw2521B-ms98-a-0042 172.100375 173.446875 yeah
sw2521B-ms98-a-0043 173.446875 184.159125 but uh that Jimmy Johnson came in too though and he just you know when he bought the team and all and and it just seemed like he just decided you know this is the way it's going to be and it was bad 
sw2521B-ms98-a-0044 184.159125 196.374375 i mean it really was to me it was like it's going to take them_1 quite a while to rebuild because e[verything]- everything i mean anything that Tom Landry wanted or had he was going to change it
sw2521B-ms98-a-0045 196.374375 204.782125 i mean it's tha[t]- i mean you know that's the way i felt about it but i tell you what if New Orleans ever gets a quarterback ain't nobody going to beat us [laughter]
sw2521B-ms98-a-0046 204.782125 210.144625 in fact nobody going to beat us then because_1 look how good we did without a quarterback this year [laughter]
sw2521B-ms98-a-0047 210.144625 212.116000 well
sw2521B-ms98-a-0048 212.116000 218.044625 they had quite a few quarterbacks if you think about it uh Arcade was for a while
sw2521B-ms98-a-0049 218.044625 224.697250 and then um i can't remember that guy's name the one that held out for the money and he was across the river
sw2521B-ms98-a-0050 224.697250 235.019000 [noise] uh i can't think of the i can't think of his name now but really we didn't have a quarterback that was the whole problem we had one guy that couldn't throw and we had one guy that couldn't run
sw2521B-ms98-a-0051 235.019000 242.466625 and it was it was just bedlam we really didn't have a quarterback it was uh defense winn[ing]- winn[ing]- winning all the games
sw2521B-ms98-a-0052 242.466625 244.872000 [silence]
sw2521B-ms98-a-0053 244.872000 248.013625 i don't know because you know they gave away a lot of their drafts
sw2521B-ms98-a-0054 248.013625 251.018125 for different people for you know other places
sw2521B-ms98-a-0055 251.018125 255.405625 so i don't know i hadn't heard you know whether they have a new one or not
sw2521B-ms98-a-0056 255.405625 257.190750 but uh
sw2521B-ms98-a-0057 257.190750 259.521375 [silence]
sw2521B-ms98-a-0058 259.521375 266.082125 huh-uh not yet but i mean i don't know whether they have one of the first you know choices of somebody that would be real good
sw2521B-ms98-a-0059 266.082125 268.611125 i mean ye[ah]- everybody gets in draft
sw2521B-ms98-a-0060 268.611125 273.086375 but i don't know whether they'll be far enough up where they can do any good
sw2521B-ms98-a-0061 273.086375 274.652750 but uh
sw2521B-ms98-a-0062 274.652750 278.265375 [silence]
sw2521B-ms98-a-0063 278.265375 282.191125 right but we really i mean really and truly we just don't have a quarterback
sw2521B-ms98-a-0064 282.191125 292.991875 that's all there is to it but the players and stuff they finally quit giving away the really good players and started keeping them too because_1 we had some you remember when Archie Manning was a quarterback
sw2521B-ms98-a-0065 292.991875 294.414375 [silence]
sw2521B-ms98-a-0066 294.414375 301.366500 yeah well he was good but we every time we'd get a real good player they'd treat him bad
sw2521B-ms98-a-0067 301.366500 306.399125 and of course we had a different coach then too but they'd treat him bad and then he'd leave
sw2521B-ms98-a-0068 306.399125 310.412000 or either they'd trade him off to somebody else for two of these nobodies
sw2521B-ms98-a-0069 310.412000 320.165875 and it was weird it was like they were trying if you were good boy let's don't have you on our team you know but um this year they had all good players except for the quarterback
sw2521B-ms98-a-0070 320.165875 335.069250 the quarterback all of them_1 every one that they played i think they played uh i can't remember whether we played three or four quarterbacks but all of them_1 were bad i mean they were terrible they could not pitch you know they couldn't even take hand-offs it was terrible [laughter]
sw2521B-ms98-a-0071 335.069250 340.801750 but um all the other places i mean our defense was unbelievable
sw2521B-ms98-a-0072 340.801750 343.468625 did you get to watch any of their games
sw2521B-ms98-a-0073 343.468625 348.283875 [silence]
sw2521B-ms98-a-0074 348.283875 349.680375 yeah
sw2521B-ms98-a-0075 349.680375 373.007750 [silence]
sw2521B-ms98-a-0076 373.007750 374.468250 yeah

sw2521B-ms98-a-0078 377.040625 392.815750 [silence]
sw2521B-ms98-a-0079 392.815750 397.199125 um did you ever get to watch any of the uh New Orleans games
sw2521B-ms98-a-0080 397.199125 403.339500 [silence]

sw2521B-ms98-a-0086 427.153875 428.671125 teams in your area
sw2521B-ms98-a-0087 428.671125 440.183500 [silence]

sw2521B-ms98-a-0089 442.045500 443.597875 [silence]
sw2521B-ms98-a-0090 443.597875 444.969000 yeah
sw2521B-ms98-a-0091 444.969000 455.046375 [silence]
sw2521B-ms98-a-0092 455.046375 457.197625 oh that's neat
sw2521B-ms98-a-0093 457.197625 458.343000 yeah
sw2521B-ms98-a-0094 458.343000 459.494750 [silence]
sw2521B-ms98-a-0095 459.494750 460.961375 yes
sw2521B-ms98-a-0096 460.961375 464.404250 [silence]
sw2521B-ms98-a-0097 464.404250 465.609375 oh my goodness
sw2521B-ms98-a-0098 465.609375 470.830000 [silence]
sw2521B-ms98-a-0099 470.830000 474.974000 no because_1 usually it's snowing [laughter] ice and rain and everything
sw2521B-ms98-a-0100 474.974000 483.103125 but i tell you what if you get to watch some of these now i don't know how it will be this year you know but i mean these games go right down to the wire
sw2521B-ms98-a-0101 483.103125 495.505750 it was like i was sitting on the edge of my chair you know going oh no no and one uh i can't remember it was about uh it was right close to when we was going to find out if we was going to get to be in the play-offs or not
sw2521B-ms98-a-0102 495.505750 504.266125 so we're watching the game all right the other team got the ball and we had like no we got the ball back that's the way it was and they had to kick
sw2521B-ms98-a-0103 504.266125 510.749875 and uh to know whether we were going to win the game or lose a game because they got one point ahead of us
sw2521B-ms98-a-0104 510.749875 518.252625 so we had to sit there you know and they cut the show off and showi[ng]- started showing us another football game
sw2521B-ms98-a-0105 518.252625 532.724250 we did not get to see the end of the game you talk about people calling in it was wild i mean here everybody is sitting on the edge of their chair you know and they changed it and gave us another game in the middle of another you know one that was going on
sw2521B-ms98-a-0106 532.724250 546.176000 cut us off right there the last few seconds the station finally you know how they'll put the little message down at the bottom started telling everybody that they were not the ones that had [laughter-cut] that off that it was the national you know
sw2521B-ms98-a-0107 546.176000 555.072000 uh-huh an[d]- because_1 it was funny i mean everybody was furious i was so mad i got up and went and called [laughter] [laughter-you] [laughter-know] i couldn't believe that but 
sw2521B-ms98-a-0108 555.072000 566.664625 almost every game that i watched it would come right down to the end we would be ahead you know but then at the ver[y]- in the fourth quarter they'd let them get up there either with them or you know right ahead of them_1
sw2521B-ms98-a-0109 566.664625 579.221750 and it'd come right down to the end and either we made it or we didn't oh and it was it was something else i said this is the most if we had a quarterback this year we would have went to the Super Bowl
sw2521B-ms98-a-0110 579.221750 586.832625 there's no question about it because everybody was playing good together except the quarterbacks and the quarterbacks just didn't do anything
sw2521B-ms98-a-0111 586.832625 589.848875 [silence]
sw2521B-ms98-a-0112 589.848875 595.679375 [laughter] yes but maybe we maybe we'll get your guy
sw2521B-ms98-a-0113 595.679375 597.173250 [laughter]
