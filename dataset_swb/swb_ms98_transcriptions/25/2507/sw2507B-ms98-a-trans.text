sw2507B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.494750 [noise]
sw2507B-ms98-a-0002 0.494750 1.728125 we go
sw2507B-ms98-a-0003 1.728125 4.131625 [silence]
sw2507B-ms98-a-0004 4.131625 13.933000 well i think uh i think on a scale of one to ten i would be i would be more toward a uh a uh uh an
sw2507B-ms98-a-0005 13.933000 21.682750 a stand that would not totally ban guns but would certainly very much control them_1 uh
sw2507B-ms98-a-0006 21.682750 24.375875 yeah i think that uh
sw2507B-ms98-a-0007 24.375875 36.467625 uh and and you know i- i say this because i'm coming from a i'm coming from my my uh uh my p[arents]- my parents and relatives in Massachusetts are all avid gun owners my dad's got a big collection
sw2507B-ms98-a-0008 36.467625 42.389250 uh my brother's got a collection there they both uh do police work uh they go out an[d]- shoot an[d]-
sw2507B-ms98-a-0009 42.389250 49.484125 they're from the mentality that when uh uh guns were against the law only criminals [laughter-owned] them that sort of thing 
sw2507B-ms98-a-0010 49.484125 55.296625 but i uh uh i- i think it's far too easy for people to get guns
sw2507B-ms98-a-0011 55.296625 65.976750 uh let me let me tell you a little a little more of of my background where i've really come to this position i- i as i've told you before uh we lived in Malaysia for four years
sw2507B-ms98-a-0012 65.976750 73.797375 and it uh i tell you how against the law guns or any kind of firearms are uh it's a hanging offense
sw2507B-ms98-a-0013 73.797375 86.106750 to have a gun there's two offenses that are hanging one is to have a gun and the other is to is to deal in narcotics and and there's no appeal once you're found guilty the sentence is automatic
sw2507B-ms98-a-0014 86.106750 88.214250 [silence]
sw2507B-ms98-a-0015 88.214250 97.815125 uh well it's interesting they do uh well they do and they don't not like we do here you can't buy it off the street corners but there's so much money to be made in drugs
sw2507B-ms98-a-0016 97.815125 109.484625 that there's a lot of times not for selling in Malaysia but people go to Thailand and they have to bring them through the airport there the last two people that got hung weren't even trying to sell them there they were just uh caught with them
sw2507B-ms98-a-0017 109.484625 115.727875 and and and the uh the law says that if you've got a certain quantity on you you're presumed to be a dealer
sw2507B-ms98-a-0018 115.727875 123.538125 uh if you're a user the penalty isn't much much less you go to rehabilitation if you're a dealer then you get hung but anyway uh they
sw2507B-ms98-a-0019 123.538125 128.840000 they have some very strong {antigun} laws there and and uh like it's a hanging offense
sw2507B-ms98-a-0020 128.840000 138.468125 now uh yeah people get broken into and they get slashed up with knives but at least the person has to be next to you with a kni[fe]- i mean you can outrun a knife but you can't outrun a gun
sw2507B-ms98-a-0021 138.468125 146.918375 so uh the violent uh there is not as many people getting killed in robberies and holdups and things like that as you see here
sw2507B-ms98-a-0022 146.918375 158.740750 uh that's probably why i've come to that to that way of thinking of course the uh the very emotional uh thinking over what happened to President Reagan you know the guy that got it was mentally deranged since you get one so easily
sw2507B-ms98-a-0023 158.740750 165.962625 uh but i'm sure that they get a lot of publicity there's probably a lot of people that get shot with guns by equally mentally [laughter-deranged] [laughter-people]

sw2507B-ms98-a-0035 201.396750 211.892500 yeah i think it's a i- i think it's great and i'm trying to think the uh secret service agent that got uh injured so badly when he was trying to protect President Reagan
sw2507B-ms98-a-0036 211.892500 219.194750 Brady and this is the law that's before the the legislature right now is is referred to as the Brady Bill right
sw2507B-ms98-a-0037 219.194750 220.744000 [silence]
sw2507B-ms98-a-0038 220.744000 232.365125 yeah and and that requires some that would be at the federal level and require some waiting period presumably uh during that waiting period there would be a background uh uh check that would take place
sw2507B-ms98-a-0039 232.365125 237.941250 [silence]
sw2507B-ms98-a-0040 237.941250 239.210125 yeah

sw2507B-ms98-a-0047 261.706000 265.635500 [silence]
sw2507B-ms98-a-0048 265.635500 276.967250 we you know i wonder i had occasion to go into a pawnshop recently i've never been in one in my life before and uh i was just looking around and and the majority of what they've got in there are guns
sw2507B-ms98-a-0049 276.967250 284.561375 and i'll bet they don't i'll bet you don't i- i would imagine legitimate gun dealers you'd have background checks but i'll bet if somebody goes in and offers a pawnshop
sw2507B-ms98-a-0050 284.561375 286.651125 guy some money for a gun
sw2507B-ms98-a-0051 286.651125 288.943125 he he just picks it up over the counter
sw2507B-ms98-a-0052 288.943125 296.956250 and and i was i was really surprised that there you can get guns of any kind that you want you know the other thing is you had talked about the uh
sw2507B-ms98-a-0053 296.956250 305.229375 needing a gun to protect yourself and you know maybe someday we're all going to get wiped out by a robber here and then i'll change my mind but
sw2507B-ms98-a-0054 305.229375 309.884125 there's so many accidents with children accidentally getting a hold of guns
sw2507B-ms98-a-0055 309.884125 319.375625 uh with the husband being out at night and the wife hearing rustling at the [laughter-door] he forgot his key wham he's [laughter-gone] uh i- i absolutely don't want one in my house for that reason 
sw2507B-ms98-a-0056 319.375625 322.934750 uh there's just too many things that can happen that are bad
sw2507B-ms98-a-0057 322.934750 325.905750 [silence]
sw2507B-ms98-a-0058 325.905750 327.030000 yeah
sw2507B-ms98-a-0059 327.030000 331.881500 [silence]
sw2507B-ms98-a-0060 331.881500 333.227500 oh sure
sw2507B-ms98-a-0061 333.227500 335.142500 [silence]
sw2507B-ms98-a-0062 335.142500 336.730125 yeah
sw2507B-ms98-a-0063 336.730125 338.721625 you don't know really you don't know where it is
sw2507B-ms98-a-0064 338.721625 346.980500 [silence]
sw2507B-ms98-a-0065 346.980500 348.011000 yeah
sw2507B-ms98-a-0066 348.011000 352.416500 [silence]
sw2507B-ms98-a-0067 352.416500 353.504500 yeah
sw2507B-ms98-a-0068 353.504500 358.981875 [silence]
sw2507B-ms98-a-0069 358.981875 371.822125 oh okay that's that's an interesting thing so uh yeah that the only way that would be a disadvantage if the other guy's got a gun and fires when he sees his and it's on it's on the first shot uh i think that uh uh
sw2507B-ms98-a-0070 371.822125 384.217375 yeah i- i- i think that you know people have legitimate reasons for having them_1 the only problem is so many people have them_1 that don't have legitimate reasons for having them And the other thing is that there are a lot of crimes of passion
sw2507B-ms98-a-0071 384.217375 396.373000 uh you know a guy may have one at home for his protection but suddenly uh uh yeah wife or he gets in an argument with a neighbor and he goes home particularly when we get into the hot summers and
sw2507B-ms98-a-0072 396.373000 400.986875 oh sure he goes home and gets his gun out and comes back and shoot them_1 there was a uh
sw2507B-ms98-a-0073 400.986875 409.198125 uh just recently here in Dallas i'm i'm trying to reconstruct it somebody jumped in front of somebody in line in front of a seven eleven
sw2507B-ms98-a-0074 409.198125 416.652375 and they got mad and they had a little argument over it so this one guy goes home and he is sitting talking to his his uh
sw2507B-ms98-a-0075 416.652375 427.258125 uh brother about it and he sees the guy that jumped the line in front of him coming down the street so they got out and have more words and the second party went down to his house several houses down the street and got a gun and come back and shot the other guy and killed him
sw2507B-ms98-a-0076 427.258125 435.427500 and and and when they're available like that people who normally wouldn't do things like that but momentarily fly off the trigger 
sw2507B-ms98-a-0077 435.427500 445.417875 tend to uh uh uh uh tend to do that and then it happens in the in the cities a lot it happens in uh uh i- i guess
sw2507B-ms98-a-0078 445.417875 448.343875 at certain times of the year tempers grow short
sw2507B-ms98-a-0079 448.343875 452.495250 and and it happens then and i- i uh uh
sw2507B-ms98-a-0080 452.495250 461.693625 you you know my uh uh oldest daughter's fiance is a uh is a part part he's a college professor but he also is a reserve police officer
sw2507B-ms98-a-0081 461.693625 466.890125 and and he uh he has all kinds of guns and he's taken her out to teach her to shoot
sw2507B-ms98-a-0082 466.890125 480.997500 and uh uh you know i think that's good because she's not afraid of them_1 and it it teaches her to be responsible relative to guns but uh when he's out on police work you know he leaves her home alone and shows them where they are
sw2507B-ms98-a-0083 480.997500 486.237250 in case she needs [laughter-them] and i worry about that i would almost worry about that more than if she didn't have one
sw2507B-ms98-a-0084 486.237250 487.329125 [silence]
sw2507B-ms98-a-0085 487.329125 489.150750 see what i mean yeah
sw2507B-ms98-a-0086 489.150750 490.484625 uh yeah
sw2507B-ms98-a-0087 490.484625 491.513625 [silence]
sw2507B-ms98-a-0088 491.513625 498.231125 yeah yeah years ago i lived in an apartment and one night i heard wham and boy it shock the apartment 
sw2507B-ms98-a-0089 498.231125 502.596625 and uh i came out and some girls came flying out of their apartment
sw2507B-ms98-a-0090 502.596625 508.339125 uh next to me and they asked me to come in and look and there was chips of wood all over the place
sw2507B-ms98-a-0091 508.339125 514.668250 and a big hole in the ceiling and a bullet comes to rest on the pillow beside one them's head
sw2507B-ms98-a-0092 514.668250 524.388750 evidently it had ricocheted around the room well a young boy ten or eleven years old uh was living with his dad in the apartment up above and his dad's girlfriend was visiting and the dad took the girlfriend home
sw2507B-ms98-a-0093 524.388750 532.626625 and apparently the boy had uh he had a gun in there for protection so the boy was bored it was a three fifty seven magnum and he was sitting there spinning the chamber
sw2507B-ms98-a-0094 532.626625 542.097250 and it went off and actually shot his toe off and went through the cei[ling]- uh through the his floor which was the ceiling of the apartment below that and i say ricocheted around the room a little bit
sw2507B-ms98-a-0095 542.097250 543.625250 it was kind of scary [laughter]
sw2507B-ms98-a-0096 543.625250 545.950000 [silence]
sw2507B-ms98-a-0097 545.950000 553.634500 yeah and it it it had about spent all it's energy but you could see there was splintered wood from all the places that it hit going around the room
sw2507B-ms98-a-0098 553.634500 560.261000 and and uh so i- i uh i- i think we're almost coming from the same place on this subject really
sw2507B-ms98-a-0099 560.261000 569.372625 i- i- i- i think that that we don't want to go to the extreme of banning them completely but we sure want a lot of control then and a lot of protection
sw2507B-ms98-a-0100 569.372625 572.524125 [silence]
sw2507B-ms98-a-0101 572.524125 575.547875 yeah i think i would too i think i would too
sw2507B-ms98-a-0102 575.547875 579.498875 [silence]
sw2507B-ms98-a-0103 579.498875 586.786250 yeah [laughter] be uh well it's too late h[ey]- hey if i were starting my own country from the beginning
sw2507B-ms98-a-0104 586.786250 588.485375 from the beginning i would
sw2507B-ms98-a-0105 588.485375 590.202000 [silence]
sw2507B-ms98-a-0106 590.202000 594.862375 yeah Malaysia but of course uh it's also true in Great Britain
sw2507B-ms98-a-0107 594.862375 599.888750 yeah they're not allowed in Great Britain either even the policemen don't carry them the policemen carry clubs but don't
