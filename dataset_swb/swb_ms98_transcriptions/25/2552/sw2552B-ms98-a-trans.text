sw2552B-ms98-a-0035 139.128375 141.634375 then we decided to have kids
sw2552B-ms98-a-0036 141.634375 145.556875 and uh she she got pregnant and then
sw2552B-ms98-a-0037 145.556875 148.454375 we decided she would stay home with the kids
sw2552B-ms98-a-0038 148.454375 156.741125 we would make that sacrifice it is a financial sacrifice to make because_1 we go from two incomes down to one
sw2552B-ms98-a-0039 156.741125 159.960000 and uh we made that decision
sw2552B-ms98-a-0040 159.960000 165.007500 and uh so sh[e]- after she had the first baby she stayed home
sw2552B-ms98-a-0041 165.007500 169.852375 and and we had a second baby and she's still at [laughter-home]
sw2552B-ms98-a-0042 169.852375 171.574625 and so uh
sw2552B-ms98-a-0043 171.574625 178.444000 you know at work a lot of people are you know i think well this is not a normal situation anymore in our in our
sw2552B-ms98-a-0044 178.444000 184.925250 world we live in most of them uh continue to work if they have have kids
sw2552B-ms98-a-0045 184.925250 189.901375 i only have one other person i know in my in my group here that works where the wife stays home
sw2552B-ms98-a-0046 189.901375 195.892750 and that's because of religious values as well they're Baptists and they and they think that's important
sw2552B-ms98-a-0047 195.892750 201.512125 but everybody else works and they drop their kids off at day care and and leave them and 
sw2552B-ms98-a-0048 201.512125 205.970250 i don't know i just don't want i just don't want strangers raising my children

sw2552B-ms98-a-0068 275.972000 281.511625 right we feel that you know just spending time together
sw2552B-ms98-a-0069 281.511625 285.616250 you don't necessarily have to be doing anything you know that costs money
sw2552B-ms98-a-0070 285.616250 294.576500 or or you know that requires you to go a great distance or anything like that it's just the kids like to being together as a family
sw2552B-ms98-a-0071 294.576500 300.322250 like last Saturday we went had some errands to run and so we took the kids and
sw2552B-ms98-a-0072 300.322250 306.232000 and we went by the Farmers Market down in in down there in Garland
sw2552B-ms98-a-0073 306.232000 312.890750 and they had a blast running around the Farmers Market looking at all the you know the food and tasting all the free samples
sw2552B-ms98-a-0074 312.890750 318.694000 they were giving out and they had a little pen there with animals in they could pet you know and they liked that and
sw2552B-ms98-a-0075 318.694000 329.999000 then on the way home we drove by the local high school and there happened to be an FA FAA Future Far[mers]- FA Future Farmers of America FFA
sw2552B-ms98-a-0076 329.999000 340.239500 going on there and they had all kinds of pigs and horses and goats and sheep and everything you know all out in this in the in this schoolyard there so we just said hey let's stop and
sw2552B-ms98-a-0077 340.239500 345.948875 and the kids got to go around and you know see pigs and animals and things like that and
sw2552B-ms98-a-0078 345.948875 352.110375 and for them that's wonderful you know they they they thought it was the greatest fun you know and it didn't cost any money
sw2552B-ms98-a-0079 352.110375 356.044625 and uh you don't have quite as much money when when the wife doesn't work
sw2552B-ms98-a-0080 356.044625 364.752375 [silence]
sw2552B-ms98-a-0081 364.752375 366.176375 right

sw2552B-ms98-a-0086 382.280125 390.304250 right oh definitely motherhood is devalued in this s[ociety]- society if you're stay home and you're a mother it's like
sw2552B-ms98-a-0087 390.304250 397.852625 what a waste people think you know you should be fulfilling yourself and and a mother isn't an important
sw2552B-ms98-a-0088 397.852625 403.987000 important thing as as having a career and and that should be first and and children second but
sw2552B-ms98-a-0089 403.987000 404.993875 [silence]
sw2552B-ms98-a-0090 404.993875 410.776750 they don't have kind of an what we call an internal perspective of things [laughter] that
sw2552B-ms98-a-0091 410.776750 412.600875 [silence]
sw2552B-ms98-a-0092 412.600875 413.904000 no

sw2552B-ms98-a-0096 423.520500 430.965250 uh at this point it's not to say that some day you won't go back to work my mother's a school teacher and
sw2552B-ms98-a-0097 430.965250 438.277000 and when when we started uh having kids she had to work for a little while but then she just started substituting
sw2552B-ms98-a-0098 438.277000 443.632000 so she would just substitute once or twice a week you know just for that little extra money
sw2552B-ms98-a-0099 443.632000 451.445750 when we were in school then we would just come home and just be you know go to a neighbor's house for an hour then she'd be home but she wouldn't do that every day
sw2552B-ms98-a-0100 451.445750 453.282125 but now that my
sw2552B-ms98-a-0101 453.282125 460.984375 my uh youngest sister's at BYU now and so they have no one at home she's back teaching school full time now again
sw2552B-ms98-a-0102 460.984375 463.720375 so if you know it's not it's just a temporary thing
sw2552B-ms98-a-0103 463.720375 467.570625 [silence]
sw2552B-ms98-a-0104 467.570625 468.805750 um-hum

sw2552B-ms98-a-0109 476.036250 476.273500 [noise]
sw2552B-ms98-a-0110 476.273500 485.563500 yeah you it's it's hard sometimes at work because_1 you know people say oh we're taking a cruise we're going here we're going there you know because_1 they have a lot more money
sw2552B-ms98-a-0111 485.563500 491.263000 and a lot of them decide just not to have children it's it's amazing they either have one or none
sw2552B-ms98-a-0112 491.263000 501.685500 and and the one person i know that has one they they feel guilty she has this continual guilt trip that she's not doing the right thing and so
sw2552B-ms98-a-0113 501.685500 504.747875 on uh on weekends she would you know
sw2552B-ms98-a-0114 504.747875 516.522250 spend all of their time with their kids and spend lots of lots and lots of money basically i think they they really spoil the child to try to overcompensate for their guilt feelings
sw2552B-ms98-a-0115 516.522250 522.207750 and and and they don't want to have anymore children because they just don't think you know
sw2552B-ms98-a-0116 522.207750 528.593125 that she doesn't think she could be a mother at home that's not her bag so she just doesn't think she could
sw2552B-ms98-a-0117 528.593125 533.297250 you know the guilt feelings she [laughter-can't] [laughter-deal] [laughter-with] with it anymore so
sw2552B-ms98-a-0118 533.297250 534.501625 you know
sw2552B-ms98-a-0119 534.501625 536.106250 [silence]
sw2552B-ms98-a-0120 536.106250 539.450375 um-hum yeah my wife uh
sw2552B-ms98-a-0121 539.450375 541.771250 likes staying home
sw2552B-ms98-a-0122 541.771250 544.639250 uh she works at home some though
sw2552B-ms98-a-0123 544.639250 552.022000 the place she works with worked with before um worked out an arrangement with her where she can work at home
sw2552B-ms98-a-0124 552.022000 553.937250 part time
sw2552B-ms98-a-0125 553.937250 563.629875 and so uh that it's kind of a seasonal thing three times a year she's really busy doing certain things based on that kind of business but the rest of the time she's free
sw2552B-ms98-a-0126 563.629875 567.908250 she likes to sew and do crafts and things [laughter-like] [laughter-that]
sw2552B-ms98-a-0127 567.908250 574.192500 so she enjoys staying at home but uh the money part of it is not as rewarding obviously but
sw2552B-ms98-a-0128 574.192500 578.174500 there's different rewards you know different kinds of rewards
sw2552B-ms98-a-0129 578.174500 585.812750 [silence]
sw2552B-ms98-a-0130 585.812750 594.152375 right right right and you really have to make a quite a bit of money the wife doesn't make it worth it with the cost of day care 
sw2552B-ms98-a-0131 594.152375 596.340000 i know there's you know
sw2552B-ms98-a-0132 596.340000 601.155750 when you adjust your income for what you put out for day care you know you're only making like five
