sw2589A-ms98-a-0031 166.065000 168.489125 uh American History
sw2589A-ms98-a-0032 168.489125 180.643750 we have to take um like this is like early seventeen hundreds through i don't know i think like mid eighteen hundreds and then we have to take another one that's mid eighteen hundreds on up to basically present

sw2589A-ms98-a-0043 233.148250 240.481125 any way this this um school system thing i i tell you i saw something on the news oh
sw2589A-ms98-a-0044 240.481125 248.503500 i don't know maybe [noise] two weeks ago and they were talking about i don't know where you're from but i'm from the Dallas area
sw2589A-ms98-a-0045 248.503500 254.946875 and they were talking about the Plano school system that they had one school
sw2589A-ms98-a-0046 254.946875 268.953125 that uh if the students did something wrong i mean whether it was behavioral or uh you know they weren't learning properly or something they took these students and put them basically in a closet
sw2589A-ms98-a-0047 268.953125 277.250500 with no windows they had a a table or not a table but a desk in this closet and they had to sit in there by themselves
sw2589A-ms98-a-0048 277.250500 286.694125 well parents were getting really angry [noise] about this because they said why is my child being put in this closet well how is that helping my child
sw2589A-ms98-a-0049 286.694125 288.051625 you know and
sw2589A-ms98-a-0050 288.051625 294.637375 uh the the thing you know they said well we're giving them isolation time and this helps them to think
sw2589A-ms98-a-0051 294.637375 294.984875 [laughter]
sw2589A-ms98-a-0052 294.984875 297.959125 but a lot of kids i mean if a child has
sw2589A-ms98-a-0053 297.959125 303.915750 uh claustrophobia i mean that's just going to terrify him you know and
sw2589A-ms98-a-0054 303.915750 306.482125 [silence]
sw2589A-ms98-a-0055 306.482125 310.207500 [laughter] uh that's true [laughter]
sw2589A-ms98-a-0056 310.207500 319.857250 that's true but no i mean they were uh i mean i definitely agree with parents i think that is a very wrong way to handle uh disciplining a child putting them in
sw2589A-ms98-a-0057 319.857250 332.971625 i mean they were they were call[ed]- they called them their quiet rooms or their isolation rooms they didn't call them closets but they showed these rooms on uh you know on the news and i mean they looked like a closet to me you know with a desk in it a real small
sw2589A-ms98-a-0058 332.971625 338.831625 but they said that one of the solutions they came up with was to take the doors off of these isolation rooms
sw2589A-ms98-a-0059 338.831625 344.297000 i said now what good does thi[s]- i mean how is this helping i mean either way [laughter]
sw2589A-ms98-a-0060 344.297000 348.625250 you know i i definitely had to disagree with that i think that is
sw2589A-ms98-a-0061 348.625250 355.001125 that's not the way to handle a child you know discipline a child by putting him in a closet [laughter]

sw2589A-ms98-a-0082 431.776375 432.781000 [silence]
sw2589A-ms98-a-0083 432.781000 437.956250 um i have to i think one of the positive things
sw2589A-ms98-a-0084 437.956250 441.841875 i mean one of the things that can come out of uh
sw2589A-ms98-a-0085 441.841875 454.119750 is not just di[scipline]- discipline okay but okay for instance one of the things they do at uh my kids school uh they have what they call uh caught being good slips
sw2589A-ms98-a-0086 454.119750 466.577500 and when the kids are in halls and stuff and if they're being really good i mean just being excellent they're not you know cutting up and so on they're just standing in line doing whatever they are supposed to they get one of these caught being good slips
sw2589A-ms98-a-0087 466.577500 475.184750 and then when they collect them at the end of each week they get to go to this little what they call their caught being good store and then they get to spend these like money
sw2589A-ms98-a-0088 475.184750 484.782250 well see to me that's positive reinforcement is much better much better than trying to find ways to discipline kids
sw2589A-ms98-a-0089 484.782250 490.286875 because they're going to be good and try and earn those things
sw2589A-ms98-a-0090 490.286875 503.611875 you know to get the positive part of it i mean they'd ra[ther]- much rather go in the store and buy something than be spanked so they're definitely going to work towards being good you know rather than trying to act up and be bad
sw2589A-ms98-a-0091 503.611875 504.974250 you know
sw2589A-ms98-a-0092 504.974250 519.718875 [silence]
sw2589A-ms98-a-0093 519.718875 521.159625 yeah
sw2589A-ms98-a-0094 521.159625 530.073250 well that's true [laughter] i think i think really though i mean that's one thing that i mean my kids definitely get spanked when they need they need to be [laughter-spanked]
sw2589A-ms98-a-0095 530.073250 539.948625 but i really do try to use positive uh reinforcement with them at home also and it really helps and i mean they they don't get spanked very often but
sw2589A-ms98-a-0096 539.948625 543.706000 they they do when they deserve it you know but uh
sw2589A-ms98-a-0097 543.706000 546.864750 i don't think any kid should be exempt from being spanked [laughter]
sw2589A-ms98-a-0098 546.864750 557.414250 i mean i i think i wouldn't mind if a teacher spanked my child but you know that's just my personal opinion and that's not going to i mean i don't think that law will ever change
sw2589A-ms98-a-0099 557.414250 560.712500 they are never going to let a a teacher spank a child again
sw2589A-ms98-a-0100 560.712500 570.595000 but i don't think i mean some kids don't get don't get spanked at home and some kids need to be spanked at [laughter-home] i mean don't you [laughter-think]
sw2589A-ms98-a-0101 570.595000 573.224875 [laughter]
sw2589A-ms98-a-0102 573.224875 574.829875 but i don't know
sw2589A-ms98-a-0103 574.829875 578.022250 [silence]
sw2589A-ms98-a-0104 578.022250 592.432750 right right well there's so many parents that say you can deal with a child without spanking them which is true you can but there are times when a child needs to be spanked i mean they do things that they need that
sw2589A-ms98-a-0105 592.432750 598.877625 [silence]
