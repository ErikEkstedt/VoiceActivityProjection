sw2589B-ms98-a-0004 11.263750 14.916250 the first direction that i can see
sw2589B-ms98-a-0005 14.916250 18.289250 or i wish i would love to see them go with

sw2589B-ms98-a-0007 20.688000 28.084750 kids learn at different rates and for too long they've kind of lumped everybody together you'd learn at this rate and that's the only way it's going to happen

sw2589B-ms98-a-0009 29.326250 37.145125 you've got some kids that'll pick up on it in the first three minutes you're talking about it and the re[st]- the other fifty seven minutes you've been talking about a subject you've bored them

sw2589B-ms98-a-0011 63.198875 67.065875 the educators need to be a little bit more

sw2589B-ms98-a-0015 74.257875 77.096500 uh the various students
sw2589B-ms98-a-0016 77.096500 80.365750 to get the maximum

sw2589B-ms98-a-0022 97.605500 99.289250 instead of
sw2589B-ms98-a-0023 99.289250 102.557750 pushing the scales too far either direction
sw2589B-ms98-a-0024 102.557750 106.812875 i mean it's great to be well rounded and have be exposed to all this stuff
sw2589B-ms98-a-0025 106.812875 114.046500 but why not hit the points the kid's really interested in because if he's interested he's going to study it and he's going to learn it and he's going to remember it

sw2589B-ms98-a-0031 163.897625 167.804125 what what type of history class is it that you're having to take

sw2589B-ms98-a-0033 181.100750 182.990750 well the early ones
sw2589B-ms98-a-0034 182.990750 189.019125 they could actually combine two two levels of it the one from seventeen hundred -[un]til
sw2589B-ms98-a-0035 189.019125 197.951625 say the end of the Civil War combine that into one and then from eighteen sixty five to present and make that your second step because
sw2589B-ms98-a-0036 197.951625 205.375500 to a point to a point the bottom you know the early parts of it you're giving the foundations of the nation and
sw2589B-ms98-a-0037 205.375500 206.829250 but
sw2589B-ms98-a-0038 206.829250 212.766250 even then they're skimming over they're very tri[vial]- almost trivial with it

sw2589B-ms98-a-0040 215.260125 219.974000 they want if i mean if they really wanted to get to the meat of the matter i mean there's
sw2589B-ms98-a-0041 219.974000 228.238000 they make all these people out to be oh they were great men and they're the father of the country and all this he had just as much dirt on him as anybody else if not more

sw2589B-ms98-a-0047 357.743250 366.831000 as a part of the revamping of the entire education system on that lev[el]- the public school system i want to see changed too
sw2589B-ms98-a-0048 366.831000 369.760375 when i was br[ought]- brought up
sw2589B-ms98-a-0049 369.760375 378.776625 if you crossed the line and you broke a rule bad enough you were going to get spanked well then the extreme came in and now we can no longer spank them so we now isolate them
sw2589B-ms98-a-0050 378.776625 384.350750 okay we've swung the pendulum both ways let's find a middle ground instead of
sw2589B-ms98-a-0051 384.350750 388.957500 there has to be some sort of discipline and there has to be some sort of punishment
sw2589B-ms98-a-0052 388.957500 394.338000 short of physically isolating the child and short of physically hitting the child
sw2589B-ms98-a-0053 394.338000 400.636500 let's put him into a situation where okay you crossed the line you broke the rule you're going to have to pay for it
sw2589B-ms98-a-0054 400.636500 401.824625 but
sw2589B-ms98-a-0055 401.824625 405.368750 it's going to tax you physically

sw2589B-ms98-a-0057 407.552125 409.673625 have th[e]- i mean
sw2589B-ms98-a-0058 409.673625 414.401875 in[stead]- instead ha[ve]- have them pick up around the school yard have them
sw2589B-ms98-a-0059 414.401875 419.300500 weed a flower bed somewhere on the school yar[d]- do something to beautify the school property

sw2589B-ms98-a-0061 420.788625 427.193625 but you cut you know the the kid's having to give up his quote play time to
sw2589B-ms98-a-0062 427.193625 430.301750 pay his debt for what he did wrong
sw2589B-ms98-a-0063 430.301750 433.262750 but he's seeing something constructive come out of it
sw2589B-ms98-a-0064 433.262750 503.833125 [silence]
sw2589B-ms98-a-0065 503.833125 512.559375 i think that not only applies inside the public school system but in society itself we've been too long there's been too much negative reinforcement how much
sw2589B-ms98-a-0066 512.559375 514.232250 [silence]
sw2589B-ms98-a-0067 514.232250 515.630125 day like
sw2589B-ms98-a-0068 515.630125 520.608875 the caught being good slips how about just the John Q citizen out there on the street

sw2589B-ms98-a-0070 568.588375 571.472625 i m[ost]- m[ost]- most wholeheartedly agree

sw2589B-ms98-a-0072 573.930250 578.953125 i mean there's a point of over kill but somewhere in you've got to find an even line
sw2589B-ms98-a-0073 578.953125 591.787625 [silence]
sw2589B-ms98-a-0074 591.787625 599.949000 need that shock effect where they equate the shock of being spanked with the actions they did to get spanked
