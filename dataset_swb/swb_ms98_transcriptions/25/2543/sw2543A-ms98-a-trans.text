sw2543A-ms98-a-0002 2.489500 14.620375 well i um several years ago a radio broke in my car and i never i got out of the habit of listening to the radio and so
sw2543A-ms98-a-0003 14.620375 25.310000 i haven't been listening i- i used to just listen to the rock stations but um [noise] lately i have been going back to classical music i don't really know what
sw2543A-ms98-a-0004 25.310000 34.755250 too many of the most popular songs are unless you know they're in the the news or something but um so i tend to listen to some of the older
sw2543A-ms98-a-0005 34.755250 43.822000 songs that were popular back when i was paying attention and then i like some classical music and some of the
sw2543A-ms98-a-0006 43.822000 51.169125 pieces that have been around a while i haven't paid much attention to most of the current music what about you

sw2543A-ms98-a-0027 123.554000 137.919375 yes i don't i never liked any of the heavy metal music [laughter] i never really listened to it because i you know i prefer to have more i guess an established pattern of
sw2543A-ms98-a-0028 137.919375 152.094875 music to listen to but and i back a long time ago when the rap music first came out it was kind of a novelty and i listened to some of it but i you know now that there's just a million rap groups and
sw2543A-ms98-a-0029 152.094875 158.995500 and uh they try to tend to try to do outdo each other with raciness i think and
sw2543A-ms98-a-0030 158.995500 172.159000 so i you know i'm not attracted to that at all but um it made a big difference in my life not to have a radio that was a easy access and so now that i do have one i just don't automatically turn it on
sw2543A-ms98-a-0031 172.159000 182.614125 unless there's something i'm particularly listening to but you know if you go two or three years without having that what i got the most exposure to
sw2543A-ms98-a-0032 182.614125 186.717625 it really changed my lifestyle and kept me from
sw2543A-ms98-a-0033 186.717625 194.880250 just having a you know easy access to current music and so i did like i say tend to go back to
sw2543A-ms98-a-0034 194.880250 205.106375 albums and cassettes and things that i had already had purchased but we don't have a CD yet do you
sw2543A-ms98-a-0035 205.106375 215.265000 [silence]
sw2543A-ms98-a-0036 215.265000 216.667875 uh-huh

sw2543A-ms98-a-0038 217.883375 232.632375 yeah i- i kind of decided to wait until it it was around a while it was kind of like remember when personal [laughter-calculators] [laughter-first] came out and they were really really expensive and then now you can get one for two or three dollars
sw2543A-ms98-a-0039 232.632375 234.874625 uh-huh uh-huh
sw2543A-ms98-a-0040 234.874625 239.016875 [silence]
sw2543A-ms98-a-0041 239.016875 251.533625 sure and also they get better quality w[ith]- and they learn to have more features and things and without and making them less expensive so we're kind of waiting
sw2543A-ms98-a-0042 251.533625 259.957875 to like uh now you know and the price of cassettes has gone down because CDs are so popular so
sw2543A-ms98-a-0043 259.957875 264.364375 [silence]
sw2543A-ms98-a-0044 264.364375 267.611250 i haven't even priced them_1 i guess they must be

sw2543A-ms98-a-0046 269.630000 273.921750 oh really that is [laughter-awful] [laughter]

sw2543A-ms98-a-0051 281.509375 289.144625 take our time well i can't imagine um you can't record on them and so
sw2543A-ms98-a-0052 289.144625 294.401250 they won't be as functional as like a cassette player where if you heard something
sw2543A-ms98-a-0053 294.401250 309.029875 you could record it you know uh if you have i guess if you wanted to record something to play out in your car or something that you'd heard or that you owned an album of so CDs won't be nearly as handy

sw2543A-ms98-a-0067 372.531750 375.512125 why we haven't either but we you know we like the
sw2543A-ms98-a-0068 375.512125 387.745375 the idea of having great um extra quality you know in your music and things but but i'm satisfied to just have what i've been used to not have to think about the great [laughter-financial] 
sw2543A-ms98-a-0069 387.745375 397.514750 sacrifice that that would be to suddenly try to switch over to all CDs or something but i know one thing that has colored my music choice is
sw2543A-ms98-a-0070 397.514750 412.174250 when we had children um i really started to think about what kind of television programs i was watching and what kind of music i was listening to and activities because um you know i just didn't want them to be exposed to
sw2543A-ms98-a-0071 412.174250 421.090250 a lot of things and a lot of the lot of the songs have some lyrics that um i just wasn't pleased with you know
sw2543A-ms98-a-0072 421.090250 427.256250 um-hum and so i really think we've tried to tone down
sw2543A-ms98-a-0073 427.256250 435.979250 our taste there to make uh you know our children not be exposed to so many ne[gative]- negative things so early in life

sw2543A-ms98-a-0085 487.774625 492.598125 yes i know what you mean i- i know my husband he um
sw2543A-ms98-a-0086 492.598125 507.192125 plays an instrument and he played in the band when he was in college and in high school and so he has a lot of all different kinds of music and he goes out of his way to play marching band music or
sw2543A-ms98-a-0087 507.192125 518.194000 like you say jazz or classical to the children to to give them some exposure to different kinds of music and i think that's really good because_1 they're learning to like all different kinds and
sw2543A-ms98-a-0088 518.194000 519.458625 [silence]
sw2543A-ms98-a-0089 519.458625 525.542375 he plays the it's a euphonium it's like a small
sw2543A-ms98-a-0090 525.542375 530.390500 a really small not a tuba but
sw2543A-ms98-a-0091 530.390500 541.346125 i th[ink]- it's hard to [laughter-explain] i never had known anyone to play one before but it's kind of like a small small tuba but it's not the kind that sits up on your shoulder 
sw2543A-ms98-a-0092 541.346125 546.884625 but it's a cross between a tuba and and an and you know a horn it's a brass instrument
sw2543A-ms98-a-0093 546.884625 553.135625 so he plays that and and a little bit of piano and
sw2543A-ms98-a-0094 553.135625 558.280750 but he has some real fond memories of marching band and
sw2543A-ms98-a-0095 558.280750 560.338000 concert band type
sw2543A-ms98-a-0096 560.338000 565.425625 activities and he thinks that'd be good for the [laughter-kids] [laughter]
