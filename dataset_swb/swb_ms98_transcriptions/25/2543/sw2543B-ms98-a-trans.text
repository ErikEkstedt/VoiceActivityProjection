sw2543B-ms98-a-0015 62.897625 71.514250 i'll listen to some of the rock stations i also like the uh the the classic rock stations that play the older more mellow type
sw2543B-ms98-a-0016 71.514250 81.946875 rock music um some of the some of the rock stations now are the i guess the top forty stations or whatever they just it really gets on my nerves because they play so many commercials and
sw2543B-ms98-a-0017 81.946875 92.556000 sometimes the deejays are just kind of annoying and irritating and uh it gets kind of old and they play the same songs over and over and i just get kind of tired of all that
sw2543B-ms98-a-0018 92.556000 102.563625 so lots of times i'll just play cassettes instead of listening to the radio actually but uh most of my cassettes i guess i don't i don't like hard rock
sw2543B-ms98-a-0019 102.563625 110.564750 um i have some some rock and some jazz and couple of maybe one or two country and western some uh

sw2543B-ms98-a-0057 266.773125 270.060750 they're somewhere between ten and fifteen dollars a piece

sw2543B-ms98-a-0060 272.969250 282.140625 i bought some at Christmas time for friends of mine that have CD players i thought my gosh now i know another reason why i'm not going to get a CD player for a while

sw2543B-ms98-a-0068 318.041625 332.430250 but i never realized you couldn't record onto C[D]- i just never really thought about it because i haven't really looked into it very much i don't have one and and i've never really looked at one very closely but that that would be inconvenient because i have a cassette player in my car now i guess
sw2543B-ms98-a-0069 332.430250 347.109875 you know one of these days when i get a new car maybe i guess all of them_1 probably will have CDs players by then but uh i'm not planning on doing that for a while i just got mine paid off [laughter-so] um [laughter] i'm going to stick with the cassettes and and uh you know until 
sw2543B-ms98-a-0070 347.109875 361.403125 until they now my sister my younger sister has a she does have a CD player that she got for Christmas and she's got the the cassette so she can record off cassettes onto CDs i mean i'm sorry oth[er]- other way around off CDs onto cassettes um 
sw2543B-ms98-a-0071 361.403125 368.932000 so i can record some things from her and you know get cassettes and record off other ones or off the radio if i want to but

sw2543B-ms98-a-0090 445.391125 447.947875 i guess over the last several years
sw2543B-ms98-a-0091 447.947875 461.235500 i listen to the stereo less and less now i will turn on i've got a small jam box in my bathroom i'll turn that on while i'm in the shower and while i'm getting ready because there's really not much else i can do and it's kind of boring standing there putting on makeup so i'll turn the radio on and [noise]
sw2543B-ms98-a-0092 461.235500 471.418625 and then i listen to it when i'm in the car driving to work because again there's you know there's nothing else going on i might as well listen to the radio while i'm driving to work but other than that i've i really don't
sw2543B-ms98-a-0093 471.418625 479.008375 i don't listen to the radio or even to my albums or cassettes or anything very often anymore i guess i'm just too busy doing other things that it's
sw2543B-ms98-a-0094 479.008375 488.288375 too much trouble to get up and go decide what i want to listen to and put it on the on the turntable i don't know i just don't don't bother to do it very much anymore

sw2543B-ms98-a-0117 573.118625 579.470375 so i was i was a real good piano player but then i got interested in a lot of other things and i got real involved in many things and
sw2543B-ms98-a-0118 579.470375 588.186250 and now i don't have a piano in my apartment or anything i could sit back down and play a few things but not like i used to be able to it's kind of sad that i've let that slip away
sw2543B-ms98-a-0119 588.186250 592.887625 and i took guitar lessons i think for one or two years and uh
sw2543B-ms98-a-0120 592.887625 599.473625 that was about the same time i was taking piano and then i got too busy in high school to really keep up with it between homework
