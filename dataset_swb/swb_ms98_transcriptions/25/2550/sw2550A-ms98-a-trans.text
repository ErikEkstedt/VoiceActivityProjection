sw2550A-ms98-a-0059 202.304500 210.802375 no he uh the the i'm trying to remember Leland decided to extend Brackman's uh
sw2550A-ms98-a-0060 210.802375 213.420125 reign as a senior partner
sw2550A-ms98-a-0061 213.420125 216.749250 and the rest of the partners all got up in arms about it
sw2550A-ms98-a-0062 216.749250 225.823625 and Michael met with them and said and said you know we got to do something about this we need to make a proposal let somebody else be the leader and he kind of elected himself
sw2550A-ms98-a-0063 225.823625 233.705750 and everybody else went along with it and they they uh gave it to Leland and he hit the roof
sw2550A-ms98-a-0064 233.705750 235.379375 and um
sw2550A-ms98-a-0065 235.379375 236.380375 [silence]
sw2550A-ms98-a-0066 236.380375 242.450375 he and Brackman talked about it and and Brackman decided to try and do away with him so he fired him
sw2550A-ms98-a-0067 242.450375 250.432000 because he he violated one of their policies of going behind a senior partner's back or something
sw2550A-ms98-a-0068 250.432000 254.905875 so they fired him they chased him off with the security guards
sw2550A-ms98-a-0069 254.905875 259.662500 they're fighting out that battle now he's firm formed his own firm
sw2550A-ms98-a-0070 259.662500 261.217125 he uh
sw2550A-ms98-a-0071 261.217125 265.743750 what else did he do he did a lot of n[asty]- nasty stuff behind their back
sw2550A-ms98-a-0072 265.743750 270.814625 yeah he stole Grace and Victor they've gone with him um
sw2550A-ms98-a-0073 270.814625 273.145750 and um
sw2550A-ms98-a-0074 273.145750 276.610000 <b_aside> who are the other two he stole two associates <e_aside>
sw2550A-ms98-a-0075 276.610000 279.753750 [silence]
sw2550A-ms98-a-0076 279.753750 283.803375 Abby and Jonathan he he took Abby and Jonathan with him
sw2550A-ms98-a-0077 283.803375 288.101000 yeah and he he went to uh he went to the bank
sw2550A-ms98-a-0078 288.101000 293.086000 and he took um i can't remember the guy the guy he defended for murder
sw2550A-ms98-a-0079 293.086000 298.370000 Earl you know they had a lien against his house so he'd pay his legal bills
sw2550A-ms98-a-0080 298.370000 300.530000 do you remember that
sw2550A-ms98-a-0081 300.530000 302.028500 yeah
sw2550A-ms98-a-0082 302.028500 303.073250 [silence]
sw2550A-ms98-a-0083 303.073250 304.466250 uh-huh
sw2550A-ms98-a-0084 304.466250 310.851125 th[ey]- th[ey]- they put a lien against his house so he'd pay his legal bills because_1 it was like three or four hundred thousand dollars or something
sw2550A-ms98-a-0085 310.851125 315.425125 well Michael reduced his legal fees to twenty thousand dollars
sw2550A-ms98-a-0086 315.425125 321.166750 so that they cut that out so they they couldn't have a lien on his house anymore
sw2550A-ms98-a-0087 321.166750 329.292500 so he did away with that and then he went to the bank because_1 the bank gave him apparently some extra credit because they had that lien
sw2550A-ms98-a-0088 329.292500 335.797250 well since they didn't have the lien anymore they couldn't have the credit from the bank so that that got the firm in hot water
sw2550A-ms98-a-0089 335.797250 342.507625 and then then Michael went to court an[d]- and uh petitioned that they needed to go into solvency
sw2550A-ms98-a-0090 342.507625 345.530750 because they were so financially in bad shape
sw2550A-ms98-a-0091 345.530750 346.769375 [silence]
sw2550A-ms98-a-0092 346.769375 360.024875 and uh they all showed up in court um Leland was going to try a motion make a motion before that so they ended up both being in court in front of the judge pleading their case and um
sw2550A-ms98-a-0093 360.024875 361.246750 [silence]
sw2550A-ms98-a-0094 361.246750 373.233125 i think i think Michael was doing it on the one hand and the guy that do you remember the guy that that uh Grace had an affair with the other lawyer that she had an affair with for a while kind of an older guy sh[e]-
sw2550A-ms98-a-0095 373.233125 375.342125 [silence]
sw2550A-ms98-a-0096 375.342125 380.214875 no he wasn't at the firm he was like Rosalyn Chase's lawyer before

sw2550A-ms98-a-0098 382.173125 386.181250 it was earlier in the season she had an affair with this other lawyer

sw2550A-ms98-a-0100 387.695500 394.595875 an[d]- and anyway Le[land]- Leland apparently has hired him on now and [laughter-he's] and he's defending this case
sw2550A-ms98-a-0101 394.595875 397.957625 and what happened at the end is the judge um
sw2550A-ms98-a-0102 397.957625 402.049250 um uh Michael wa[nted]- wanted the firm put in receivership
sw2550A-ms98-a-0103 402.049250 408.539500 and the judge wouldn't do it but he said he he's going to give a like a ten day uh evaluation
sw2550A-ms98-a-0104 408.539500 416.811125 and he was going to put it in the hands of a businessman to to run it and see if the firm was salvageable or not
sw2550A-ms98-a-0105 416.811125 423.788250 and and both parties had to come up with with lists of people that were suitable to to run it
sw2550A-ms98-a-0106 423.788250 424.898375 [silence]
sw2550A-ms98-a-0107 424.898375 429.470500 [noise] and he rejected both of the lists and came up with his own person

sw2550A-ms98-a-0109 432.287125 439.327000 [laughter] think of the wor[st]- well now it might be hard but think of the the worst person that's been on the show
sw2550A-ms98-a-0110 439.327000 440.689875 uh-huh
sw2550A-ms98-a-0111 440.689875 443.151875 in in the past [laughter-two] years

sw2550A-ms98-a-0130 504.490250 512.752625 whoever plays Kuzak isn't coming back next year so some of this some of this has to do with why they're not coming back i guess

sw2550A-ms98-a-0137 533.720375 537.057125 why why they didn't invite them
sw2550A-ms98-a-0138 537.057125 542.601625 and and the the firm that Kuzak founded is just a litigation firm
sw2550A-ms98-a-0139 542.601625 548.330875 and they said well we wanted we wanted you but we didn't really want Stuart
sw2550A-ms98-a-0140 548.330875 548.535250 [laughter]
sw2550A-ms98-a-0141 548.535250 556.550875 because he's not a {litigationist} and we didn't figure you you would come without him and and we're going to be fighting against each other so
sw2550A-ms98-a-0142 556.550875 557.418875 [laughter]
sw2550A-ms98-a-0143 557.418875 559.368500 so it's just kind of weird

sw2550A-ms98-a-0154 586.320125 592.882625 yeah it's interesting to talk about their ma[rriage]- their marriage in real life because she had breast cancer and that
sw2550A-ms98-a-0155 592.882625 599.975750 yeah and that was real tough for him and there were some times on the show where there were some real emotional things going on with th[e]-
