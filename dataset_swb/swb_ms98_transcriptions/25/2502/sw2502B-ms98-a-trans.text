sw2502B-ms98-a-0003 13.261125 24.188125 not taking advantage of our you know of the financial dependence that most of the countries have on us you know uh i mean we could direct the government even more than we have been i don't think we've been doing too bad

sw2502B-ms98-a-0007 30.084250 44.350625 well i think that uh as a whole that the being that the drug problem uh the drug industry can uh bring so much money to a country i think that if it wasn't for the United States Government matching that the the g[overnment]- uh the 
sw2502B-ms98-a-0008 44.350625 49.097750 the drug uh cartels or whatever would control most the Central and Latin America

sw2502B-ms98-a-0022 157.414250 161.732500 well sometimes that's that's America doing that too you know we
sw2502B-ms98-a-0023 161.732500 170.220875 we fall out of uh agreements with certain leaders and then amazingly enough the country starts turning against our leader you know [laughter] it's uh

sw2502B-ms98-a-0027 182.732625 183.919125 right
sw2502B-ms98-a-0028 183.919125 188.168000 yeah i think that has a lot of things to did with uh um
sw2502B-ms98-a-0029 188.168000 198.088125 [silence]
sw2502B-ms98-a-0030 198.088125 203.619875 yeah that was uh it i'm i'm really wondering whether that's going it settle down or not because 
sw2502B-ms98-a-0031 203.619875 213.769250 on one hand you have you know that the the you know the the Soviet Government of course mistreating a lot of the uh Slovak countries and then on the other hand you have 
sw2502B-ms98-a-0032 213.769250 218.081500 well they they were feeding us [laughter] so uh 
sw2502B-ms98-a-0033 218.081500 220.426750 i don't know really what's going to happen

sw2502B-ms98-a-0035 227.538500 230.520000 oh yeah i think we're getting uh quite a 
sw2502B-ms98-a-0036 230.520000 235.070750 put it this way i think no i think the people are revolting themselves and we're
sw2502B-ms98-a-0037 235.070750 236.389375 uh
sw2502B-ms98-a-0038 236.389375 238.029125 allowing it to happen
sw2502B-ms98-a-0039 238.029125 239.128250 yeah
sw2502B-ms98-a-0040 239.128250 251.654750 [silence]

sw2502B-ms98-a-0045 264.427375 269.444375 yeah i think uh Central America has always been one of those places where people are more passive
sw2502B-ms98-a-0046 269.444375 272.491875 you know where it's always the minority that are
sw2502B-ms98-a-0047 272.491875 275.221500 are trying to make the country better
sw2502B-ms98-a-0048 275.221500 296.913625 [silence]
sw2502B-ms98-a-0049 296.913625 307.102875 i thought it was the other way around they were always you know having to meet in the catacombs and all this so all the persecution that they're sort of use to it it's been sort of like you know 
sw2502B-ms98-a-0050 307.102875 330.992000 [silence]
sw2502B-ms98-a-0051 330.992000 333.290375 i don't quite understand that

sw2502B-ms98-a-0057 348.518250 354.457750 well they actually understood it is in America where it was hard [laughter] Latin they're you know 
sw2502B-ms98-a-0058 354.457750 357.419625 very very very close to Spanish

sw2502B-ms98-a-0066 388.173125 391.139500 uh i never really thought of in that way
sw2502B-ms98-a-0067 391.139500 407.176375 [silence]
sw2502B-ms98-a-0068 407.176375 416.847625 i don't know could be the the economic still [vocalized-noise] you know the there's the poverty level is certainly uh you know much worse in the Latin American countries 
sw2502B-ms98-a-0069 416.847625 425.677250 i mean you can say that about Africa too i think it has something to do with the poverty level because Africa is certainly not a Catholic uh country and yet
sw2502B-ms98-a-0070 425.677250 430.551125 and you know they have the same problem where you know where kings and such 
sw2502B-ms98-a-0071 430.551125 440.848000 [silence]
sw2502B-ms98-a-0072 440.848000 443.402375 well in South Africa yeah

sw2502B-ms98-a-0074 444.577625 451.398125 in South Africa i think they are but yet you know Idi Amin was you know in power for so long [laughter]

sw2502B-ms98-a-0076 457.305625 460.268375 uh racial i think
sw2502B-ms98-a-0077 460.268375 472.081875 or like you say maybe communication of knowing that hey up in other English colonies or previous English colonies everything is equal and yet down there it's not you know
sw2502B-ms98-a-0078 472.081875 475.063125 i think communication does have a lot to do with it
sw2502B-ms98-a-0079 475.063125 482.237250 you know in education maybe i don't know about education because the black community is still not very educated down there so 
sw2502B-ms98-a-0080 482.237250 485.738375 so i think it is communication it's just {oopsy}
sw2502B-ms98-a-0081 485.738375 498.759000 [silence]
sw2502B-ms98-a-0082 498.759000 499.900750 uh-huh

sw2502B-ms98-a-0084 504.313750 513.651125 yeah that's true You know that i don't know whether uh actually i i've always wondered whether how the education system works in the Russian countries the Republics you know
sw2502B-ms98-a-0085 513.651125 517.403375 [silence]
sw2502B-ms98-a-0086 517.403375 519.706750 really that's good
sw2502B-ms98-a-0087 519.706750 524.235750 in a way [laughter] You know uh something we compete with
sw2502B-ms98-a-0088 524.235750 525.780000 uh
sw2502B-ms98-a-0089 525.780000 531.148500 and i've been sort of disappointed how that they they say literacy rate has gone down you know
sw2502B-ms98-a-0090 531.148500 532.845750 that's sort of upsetting
sw2502B-ms98-a-0091 532.845750 538.052875 to think that we're richer and yet everybody is intellectually poorer [laughter]
sw2502B-ms98-a-0092 538.052875 540.372000 in our country yeah
sw2502B-ms98-a-0093 540.372000 544.716875 that is really upsetting and and considering it's free you know
sw2502B-ms98-a-0094 544.716875 547.836500 i mean good education is really still free
