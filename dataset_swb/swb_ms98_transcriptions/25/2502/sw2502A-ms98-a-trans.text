sw2502A-ms98-a-0007 48.638500 49.687750 yeah

sw2502A-ms98-a-0011 63.996250 67.251875 he you know i just as far as feelings
sw2502A-ms98-a-0012 67.251875 69.055000 uh for people that
sw2502A-ms98-a-0013 69.055000 82.096250 their family came from there and how they feel about you know our intervention and their governments and stuff like that and he he was all for it because it's just like you say uh there's so many people there that that
sw2502A-ms98-a-0014 82.096250 91.369500 that get the kind of control that's bad you know and that their governments can become so corrupt and it's like well uh you know i use to feel like
sw2502A-ms98-a-0015 91.369500 105.954250 um well they they should work their way they you know they should should be able to work their self out of it or you know why why why intervene in another country's you know problems and things like that why why should we be the ones that have to do it and things like that 
sw2502A-ms98-a-0016 105.954250 106.734125 but
sw2502A-ms98-a-0017 106.734125 116.110750 i think just a lot of times if we don't then then it w[ill]- then that influence will affect our country too for one and for two
sw2502A-ms98-a-0018 116.110750 126.570000 you know that it it does help i mean you know i think the people in those countries do want our help the people that are y[ou]- know under conditions that are you know not favorable to this their rights

sw2502A-ms98-a-0021 129.883500 130.620875 but
sw2502A-ms98-a-0022 130.620875 142.907625 um i wish we didn't have to i mean i- i'd rather even if a country chooses a government that's not you know exactly the kind of government that we have you know or or is in complete
sw2502A-ms98-a-0023 142.907625 147.083750 opposition to it at least it's their choice as as long as long it's one that's
sw2502A-ms98-a-0024 147.083750 148.144375 [silence]
sw2502A-ms98-a-0025 148.144375 156.654000 that that makes [laughter-sense] so to speak you know this is a government that stays in power that can stay in power but it seems like most of them don't
sw2502A-ms98-a-0026 156.654000 157.932875 you know
sw2502A-ms98-a-0027 157.932875 160.732875 [silence]

sw2502A-ms98-a-0041 217.861500 218.655750 yeah
sw2502A-ms98-a-0042 218.655750 221.077125 [silence]
sw2502A-ms98-a-0043 221.077125 227.313875 but we don't we're not intervening in that or do you think that we are to the degree that we are causing
sw2502A-ms98-a-0044 227.313875 232.878750 [silence]
sw2502A-ms98-a-0045 232.878750 234.253250 [vocalized-noise]

sw2502A-ms98-a-0047 234.763750 236.605875 [silence]
sw2502A-ms98-a-0048 236.605875 238.979875 see i- i agree with that yeah
sw2502A-ms98-a-0049 238.979875 244.082000 i- i agree that that the communication uh that now that communication has become
sw2502A-ms98-a-0050 244.082000 252.063500 so much more widespread and you know s[o]- worldwide that people are realizing hey we don't have it so good and let's stand up
sw2502A-ms98-a-0051 252.063500 264.547375 for you know uh w[ell]- th[at]- this is ridiculous we're living with these kind of conditions in a world that's advancing as fast as it is that uh i think people are just saying no way we don't want any more of this
sw2502A-ms98-a-0052 264.547375 269.806625 [silence]
sw2502A-ms98-a-0053 269.806625 271.002875 yeah
sw2502A-ms98-a-0054 271.002875 274.937000 [silence]
sw2502A-ms98-a-0055 274.937000 277.040750 yeah well i mean
sw2502A-ms98-a-0056 277.040750 291.652750 i don't mean to well i guess i do in a way sometimes i think a religion has a lot to do with that i think that that uh because of those c[ountries]- countries a lot you know where such Catholic influence and i think the Catholic religion itself
sw2502A-ms98-a-0057 291.652750 296.310000 was was such a dominant factor as far as keeping the people down
sw2502A-ms98-a-0058 296.310000 297.574500 so to speak
sw2502A-ms98-a-0059 297.574500 306.888750 [silence]
sw2502A-ms98-a-0060 306.888750 313.901875 but but see th[ere]- but i don't agree with that because the Catholic religion as far as through the ages has been the rule so to speak
sw2502A-ms98-a-0061 313.901875 325.184625 you know they are the ones that set the ru[les]- set a lot of the rules and they are the ones that do keep the people down i mean when you have a religion that most of the people go to church and they don't understand when anything is being said yet they're 
sw2502A-ms98-a-0062 325.184625 331.406375 yet they're expected to bow down to it i think that keeps people in a sort of line you know
sw2502A-ms98-a-0063 331.406375 335.323250 [silence]
sw2502A-ms98-a-0064 335.323250 338.602750 well when when it use to be Latin i'm just s[aying]- saying that
sw2502A-ms98-a-0065 338.602750 339.438000 uh
sw2502A-ms98-a-0066 339.438000 340.688750 the old church
sw2502A-ms98-a-0067 340.688750 349.685250 yeah which it's not that way now but i think that there is just that i think that it's just Latin countries are slower in coming around
sw2502A-ms98-a-0068 349.685250 353.992750 [silence]
sw2502A-ms98-a-0069 353.992750 355.067250 well Latin
sw2502A-ms98-a-0070 355.067250 357.298750 [silence]
sw2502A-ms98-a-0071 357.298750 360.996250 um they still didn't understand it though i don't think
sw2502A-ms98-a-0072 360.996250 366.753125 because i- i descend from that and i you know i don't can't i don't understand Latin
sw2502A-ms98-a-0073 366.753125 371.058375 and i'm of Spanish descent so [laughter]
sw2502A-ms98-a-0074 371.058375 372.356125 um
sw2502A-ms98-a-0075 372.356125 377.573500 i- i just think that has something to do with why Latinos are tend to be
sw2502A-ms98-a-0076 377.573500 381.695000 you know the the mee[k]- the more meek you know they tend to be more 
sw2502A-ms98-a-0077 381.695000 382.702750 [silence]
sw2502A-ms98-a-0078 382.702750 386.969625 not stand up for their rights as much they're not really sure of what they are
sw2502A-ms98-a-0079 386.969625 388.546875 i don't think
sw2502A-ms98-a-0080 388.546875 390.341625 [silence]
sw2502A-ms98-a-0081 390.341625 401.163375 well i mean how can you contrast th[e]- the Europeans and their vocalism on their rights to to say the people in Latin America i mean why are they
sw2502A-ms98-a-0082 401.163375 407.430625 why are they not as vocal or why do they not you know stand up so to speak for their rights
sw2502A-ms98-a-0083 407.430625 424.324375 [silence]
sw2502A-ms98-a-0084 424.324375 425.903250 um-hum
sw2502A-ms98-a-0085 425.903250 429.003625 [silence]
sw2502A-ms98-a-0086 429.003625 433.935875 um i don't agree with that i don't agree because_1 i think that they are pretty vocal about it
sw2502A-ms98-a-0087 433.935875 436.057250 in in uh Africa
sw2502A-ms98-a-0088 436.057250 438.876250 i think they've made a lot more changes
sw2502A-ms98-a-0089 438.876250 441.584125 hey they've their very vocal
sw2502A-ms98-a-0090 441.584125 447.161750 [silence]
sw2502A-ms98-a-0091 447.161750 448.715000 w[ell]- so what's the difference
sw2502A-ms98-a-0092 448.715000 450.026250 [silence]
sw2502A-ms98-a-0093 450.026250 451.211875 yeah
sw2502A-ms98-a-0094 451.211875 457.459250 so what makes the difference between say South America and the rest of i mean South Africa and it is rest of Africa
sw2502A-ms98-a-0095 457.459250 471.181875 [silence]
sw2502A-ms98-a-0096 471.181875 472.518375 yeah
sw2502A-ms98-a-0097 472.518375 477.167500 [silence]
sw2502A-ms98-a-0098 477.167500 478.497750 yeah
sw2502A-ms98-a-0099 478.497750 487.203875 [silence]
sw2502A-ms98-a-0100 487.203875 495.155500 i think it maybe has to do with a lot uh a lot to do with education because you look at the uh European countries
sw2502A-ms98-a-0101 495.155500 500.748000 i think they are they do tend to be more educated much more educated than
sw2502A-ms98-a-0102 500.748000 504.457125 than Africa or the Latin American countries
sw2502A-ms98-a-0103 504.457125 512.318375 [silence]
sw2502A-ms98-a-0104 512.318375 519.055625 um-hum well i know that Russia they're they're comparably more ed[ucated]- better educated than we are in our country
sw2502A-ms98-a-0105 519.055625 523.528750 [silence]
sw2502A-ms98-a-0106 523.528750 524.938250 yeah
sw2502A-ms98-a-0107 524.938250 533.274000 [silence]
sw2502A-ms98-a-0108 533.274000 533.933500 yeah
sw2502A-ms98-a-0109 533.933500 537.734750 [silence]
sw2502A-ms98-a-0110 537.734750 539.024125 uh in our country
sw2502A-ms98-a-0111 539.024125 539.584000 [silence]
sw2502A-ms98-a-0112 539.584000 540.737500 yeah
sw2502A-ms98-a-0113 540.737500 547.717250 [silence]
sw2502A-ms98-a-0114 547.717250 551.436500 yeah well that's just it though good education
sw2502A-ms98-a-0115 551.436500 558.420000 is it good education it may be free but is it good education and that's just it are we willing to pay for it you know
sw2502A-ms98-a-0116 558.420000 565.319375 i mean a lot of people bitch and moan about the taxes and all but are so are they willing to pay for you know
sw2502A-ms98-a-0117 565.319375 567.946000 quality education you know
sw2502A-ms98-a-0118 567.946000 568.597000 [silence]
sw2502A-ms98-a-0119 568.597000 581.864375 so you know and yet they yet people get very frightened when they see the Japanese moving in and the the Russians moving in in certain areas of technology you know that we use to dominate and it's like well you know 
sw2502A-ms98-a-0120 581.864375 595.237875 they're educating their people to higher degrees than we do so you're going to have to expect it so what you are you willing are you willing to compromise a little and and pay pay some take some of that money out of your pocket and pay for good quality education
sw2502A-ms98-a-0121 595.237875 599.736375 so i don't know [noise] but [laughter] i- i
