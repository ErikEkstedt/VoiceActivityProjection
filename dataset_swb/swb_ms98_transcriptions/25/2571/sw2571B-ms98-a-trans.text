sw2571B-ms98-a-0002 1.571125 2.984000 um
sw2571B-ms98-a-0003 2.984000 14.200500 there was a crime here in McKinney uh a rather heinous murder there was no um remorse shown by uh
sw2571B-ms98-a-0004 14.200500 25.710750 at least one of the perpetrators and yet for whatever reason um his crime was not considered a capital crime
sw2571B-ms98-a-0005 25.710750 27.483625 [silence]
sw2571B-ms98-a-0006 27.483625 38.887875 an and quite honestly i i feel very strongly that the man ha[s]- the has no redeeming social values and if if and when he comes gets free again
sw2571B-ms98-a-0007 38.887875 43.930500 he will have no compunction but to complete that that same kind of
sw2571B-ms98-a-0008 43.930500 56.543250 lifestyle i mean continue that same kind of lifestyle and perhaps do the same thing again so it really bothers me that there's not a way of getting him out of the way forever
sw2571B-ms98-a-0009 56.543250 60.015750 [silence]
sw2571B-ms98-a-0010 60.015750 61.548375 [noise]
sw2571B-ms98-a-0011 61.548375 105.953625 [silence]
sw2571B-ms98-a-0012 105.953625 108.430000 that's that's right
sw2571B-ms98-a-0013 108.430000 122.054000 [silence]
sw2571B-ms98-a-0014 122.054000 125.561250 but yeah
sw2571B-ms98-a-0015 125.561250 127.284125 did you
sw2571B-ms98-a-0016 127.284125 131.194250 [silence]
sw2571B-ms98-a-0017 131.194250 132.670125 uh-huh
sw2571B-ms98-a-0018 132.670125 153.621000 [silence]
sw2571B-ms98-a-0019 153.621000 167.351875 yes but my concern is first of all that not all all persons who i think should be receiving capital
sw2571B-ms98-a-0020 167.351875 175.168500 uh whatever capital uh tha[t]- uh th[at]-
sw2571B-ms98-a-0021 175.168500 186.225375 hum punishment thank you i'm sorry i just got home from work and i'm just kind of spaced out a little bit uh that not all of them are being um
sw2571B-ms98-a-0022 186.225375 197.199625 convicted of it that that the the they're not even being charged with that appropr[iate]- i agree with you that that a person's heart can be changed
sw2571B-ms98-a-0023 197.199625 206.320375 but the same God that can work that miracle also established the laws that said um for certain kinds of sin certain kinds of
sw2571B-ms98-a-0024 206.320375 208.527875 [silence]
sw2571B-ms98-a-0025 208.527875 215.952500 sins certain kinds of of uh breaking of the law there would be a capital 
sw2571B-ms98-a-0026 215.952500 218.842375 punishment right then it was it was uh
sw2571B-ms98-a-0027 218.842375 233.833750 almost immediate as soon as as the trial was over then it was stoning we don't have a speedy trial we don't have speedy um punishment and so it kind of loses its meaning if you sit on death row for months and years
sw2571B-ms98-a-0028 233.833750 236.862250 and so forth
sw2571B-ms98-a-0029 236.862250 260.658500 [silence]
sw2571B-ms98-a-0030 260.658500 263.224375 that's correct
sw2571B-ms98-a-0031 263.224375 311.340375 [silence]
sw2571B-ms98-a-0032 311.340375 312.857250 uh-huh
sw2571B-ms98-a-0033 312.857250 321.479250 [silence]
sw2571B-ms98-a-0034 321.479250 325.325625 i tend to agree on that very strongly
sw2571B-ms98-a-0035 325.325625 347.237125 [silence]
sw2571B-ms98-a-0036 347.237125 360.411500 plus the all the judicial system is overloaded with all kinds of um problems and crimes and so forth and then all of the um civil things that clog the courts
sw2571B-ms98-a-0037 360.411500 371.355000 and having sat on both uh uh criminal and a civil uh jury [laughter] some of what goes through our courts is a total waste of time
sw2571B-ms98-a-0038 371.355000 383.079750 because we're suit happy but but back to the to the capital situation sounds like you and i have a lot of of of uh common ground at least as as far as as
sw2571B-ms98-a-0039 383.079750 394.995375 capital punishment is concerned i would like to see some some kind of reform or some kind of streamlining so that if a person is um convicted
sw2571B-ms98-a-0040 394.995375 403.064500 and sentenced to to death that that automatic appeal which goes in could be more quickly dealt with
sw2571B-ms98-a-0041 403.064500 417.194125 and and go ahead and get the punishment phase out of the way because it doesn't do the criminal or the victim's family or or any of us the taxpayer any good to have him sitting around for months and years
sw2571B-ms98-a-0042 417.194125 419.695750 an an bu[t]- him could be a her
sw2571B-ms98-a-0043 419.695750 421.708125 but you see
sw2571B-ms98-a-0044 421.708125 481.093750 [silence]
sw2571B-ms98-a-0045 481.093750 482.671875 um
sw2571B-ms98-a-0046 482.671875 485.257250 [silence]
sw2571B-ms98-a-0047 485.257250 487.088000 that's sad
sw2571B-ms98-a-0048 487.088000 535.293125 [silence]
sw2571B-ms98-a-0049 535.293125 536.638500 yeah
sw2571B-ms98-a-0050 536.638500 546.501375 [silence]
sw2571B-ms98-a-0051 546.501375 559.542875 however certain uh very liberal minded groups who do not um subscribe to the same ethical system that you and i do such as the uh civil liberties unions and so forth
sw2571B-ms98-a-0052 559.542875 572.310500 will lobby against that and hold that out as long as they have breath which is most unfortunate because we all lose out when people go so far out to the extreme on either side
sw2571B-ms98-a-0053 572.310500 584.369000 because too too often they're can be extremism that that hurts from from any direction regardless of wha[tever]- whatever you're arguing or concerned about and
sw2571B-ms98-a-0054 584.369000 586.491000 we all lose out
sw2571B-ms98-a-0055 586.491000 592.961000 [silence]
sw2571B-ms98-a-0056 592.961000 594.320125 yeah
