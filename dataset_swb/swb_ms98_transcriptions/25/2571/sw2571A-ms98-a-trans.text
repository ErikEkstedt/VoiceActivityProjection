sw2571A-ms98-a-0010 54.323125 63.560500 [noise] really i think that i don't know i don['t]- i don't think our prison system isn't set up where we um
sw2571A-ms98-a-0011 63.560500 73.494000 rehabilitate or you know restore anybody i think it'll only make them worse but i i believe that God can come in and change a person's heart
sw2571A-ms98-a-0012 73.494000 83.220000 and genuinely change it but that doesn't negate that you do reap what you sow and if you do kill a person and it is
sw2571A-ms98-a-0013 83.220000 92.631500 you know you're found to be guilty i believe God establishes the authority of our court system and i believe that you know that i do believe that capital punishment is uh
sw2571A-ms98-a-0014 92.631500 99.807250 alternative even you know God can still change your heart but that doesn't mean like the alcoholic that charges up all the
sw2571A-ms98-a-0015 99.807250 108.772250 bills on the credit card or the {shopaholic} you know you get your life right with God but you still have to pay your Visa bill you still have to
sw2571A-ms98-a-0016 108.772250 120.434125 you know so but God sent us his grace and they give pardons but i believe if it's a genuine conversion there's a genuine and those prison people know they know a genuine
sw2571A-ms98-a-0017 120.434125 126.684750 turnaround in a person's character they see that and i i worked in a prison in Fort Worth
sw2571A-ms98-a-0018 126.684750 138.045125 yeah i have a degree in social work you see it you know the ones that have a genuine character change it is obvious and they know that they're they're not going to pardon someone from the governor
sw2571A-ms98-a-0019 138.045125 149.994500 you know what i'm saying they're not going to go without going through every channel of authority in the prison so i feel like you know that's is there is occasions where there are they do spare lives and you know i leave that with the governor who
sw2571A-ms98-a-0020 149.994500 155.968375 of course is going to go through every authority because they want to be be reelected so

sw2571A-ms98-a-0034 222.756250 225.977000 right but in in the Old Test[ament]-

sw2571A-ms98-a-0038 234.015375 235.289500 right
sw2571A-ms98-a-0039 235.289500 247.055250 we don't well yeah we definitely have lost the Judeo-Christian ethic of the judicial system for sure but the ba[se]- the base is still there the foundation is still there though
sw2571A-ms98-a-0040 247.055250 261.750250 bu[t]- of the system but i know what you're saying uh but also they're under a law because we haven't been removed from the law we've just been taken out from under under a law because under the law if your child mo[cked]- back talked you he would be stoned
sw2571A-ms98-a-0041 261.750250 272.716500 yeah under the law he would be stoned so we've been removed from the law of un[der]- from being under the law but we're still you know we're still accountable to it we don't need to back talk but
sw2571A-ms98-a-0042 272.716500 282.760375 you know it's like God changes your heart to not do that he changes your heart not to look upon a woman in lust because in the Old Testament they could look all they wanted just couldn't do it
sw2571A-ms98-a-0043 282.760375 297.322750 but in the new he's looking at your heart and so i guess that's what what i mean by their character changes and you know what i mean it's like looking beyond what they're doing and looking at a heart and seeing what is the heart what's the character showing me here and
sw2571A-ms98-a-0044 297.322750 311.599125 those and then any of if i don't think see if i don't believe that there's not a character change and the authorities agree that this person needs to be excused i believe for murder uh rape i even believe incest things
sw2571A-ms98-a-0045 311.599125 322.804250 that will permanently damage uh the character of the child i believe crimes against children should be punished bu[t]- by by death i believe
sw2571A-ms98-a-0046 322.804250 336.944125 sexual crimes unless there's a true change of character and that's where we just have to to trust the authorities and they're not going to excuse people if it was was run like that i don't there would probably be very few exceptions to
sw2571A-ms98-a-0047 336.944125 350.335750 that and if it was done quickly and done swiftly and but it's not because the judicial system has rejected they've rejected the answer to all these problems they have pretty much

sw2571A-ms98-a-0070 420.455625 432.533125 i know in Jamaica uh it think it's Jamaica i think it's Jamaica i know that they have you know crimes punishable by death and i'm sure they hit a few every now and then and i wouldn't want to be one of them that are not guilty
sw2571A-ms98-a-0071 432.533125 442.921375 but i know that they have like uh their crime rate it's not Jamaica i don't think i can't remember which it's uh one of the Caribbean Islands and and they
sw2571A-ms98-a-0072 442.921375 454.176375 Singapore is it like that my husband's going Singapore and they don't have a lot of the crime because there is a law and the law is enforced and that's what wh[at]- when you have lawlessness
sw2571A-ms98-a-0073 454.176375 461.310000 i mean the law's not being enforced and all that does is lawlessness we were we went on a mission trip to Manhattan
sw2571A-ms98-a-0074 461.310000 470.478125 and to the Bronx and stuff two years ago and all these kids were up on there getting arrested for crack and everyone was out uh we were across from
sw2571A-ms98-a-0075 470.478125 482.022000 that big bus station i forget what you call it but anyway and everyone they had like fifteen people lined up on the fence and within two hours there were fifteen boys sitting there doing the same thing
sw2571A-ms98-a-0076 482.022000 486.123125 and you'd see the same kid who were back out there in two days
sw2571A-ms98-a-0077 486.123125 500.406875 because there's no the answer is not being given to them in the court system and i think initially when our country was set up it was set up with God and it was really an integral part and no you can't
sw2571A-ms98-a-0078 500.406875 514.005500 you can't force people but i think people are hurting and they're out doing crack sitting on the street they were the kind of people that i think mostly we would want to receive it if it was presented to see i don't know i guess i'm kind of frustrated that
sw2571A-ms98-a-0079 514.005500 526.266500 you know we've gotten away from the Christian basis that our court system was founded upon i mean it reeks of the Bible just the whole thing the whole system and so i feel like if that was presented
sw2571A-ms98-a-0080 526.266500 536.263875 more openly and not just relying upon and para church ministry to come in and do it but that the system itself you know you know what i mean
sw2571A-ms98-a-0081 536.263875 547.400875 i feel like that might be better if it was run on a more scriptural basis which would include you know you know and expediting the penalties and just getting it over with

sw2571A-ms98-a-0095 590.827750 598.621500 okay what's my role in this thing [laughter] you know what's my part because i don't think the system is going to get fixed i think it's crippled
