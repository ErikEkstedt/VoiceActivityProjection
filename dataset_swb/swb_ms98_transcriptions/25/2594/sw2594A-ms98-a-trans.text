sw2594A-ms98-a-0018 51.196500 58.099000 there's a a lot of projects where the the Boy Scouts and things and that will collect your cans and it's a good fund raiser for the kids
sw2594A-ms98-a-0019 58.099000 64.110125 [silence]
sw2594A-ms98-a-0020 64.110125 65.563500 um-hum
sw2594A-ms98-a-0021 65.563500 69.047500 i guess i you see i guess it depends on your landfill space
sw2594A-ms98-a-0022 69.047500 75.002625 i know i we're in Maryland but my i from Pennsylvania and my parents how are forced recycling
sw2594A-ms98-a-0023 75.002625 84.748750 uh yeah all plastic they ha[ve]- all plastic has to go into a recycling bin all cans have to be recycled all newspapers have to be recycled
sw2594A-ms98-a-0024 84.748750 96.585125 because they're um they're just running out of space and landfills uh Pennsylvania Ohio and New York are some of the uh they're using their landfills up faster than they can get new ones
sw2594A-ms98-a-0025 96.585125 104.935500 so it's really uh it's uh really hard on them now up here in Maryland though we're j[ust]- just in a voluntary recycling stage right now so
sw2594A-ms98-a-0026 104.935500 118.131500 uh so my wife and i you know we save our bottles and we save our newspapers and we save all of our plastic and all of our tin cans and just like you say we go to uh a community area where they have it set up and we dump them_1 off there
sw2594A-ms98-a-0027 118.131500 119.193375 [silence]
sw2594A-ms98-a-0028 119.193375 120.848250 yeah it's still voluntary
sw2594A-ms98-a-0029 120.848250 127.303125 though i think i think we're supposed to have something [impeme/implemented] implemented by nineteen ninety three though
sw2594A-ms98-a-0030 127.303125 130.865875 where some aspects will be mandatory um-hum

sw2594A-ms98-a-0032 136.112000 137.706500 mostly just the cans
sw2594A-ms98-a-0033 137.706500 145.994625 and i and most of the time like i said that's that's a sort of like fund raiser things that the schools do or that the Boy Scouts do or whatever
sw2594A-ms98-a-0034 145.994625 147.246250 yeah
sw2594A-ms98-a-0035 147.246250 150.536125 um-hum cans are the only thing i think you really get money for

sw2594A-ms98-a-0041 162.940125 172.384500 yeah and i think that's mostly well you know we even before as soon as the community said you know we're going to put up bins for recycling you know we automatically
sw2594A-ms98-a-0042 172.384500 182.608875 started doing it it was it's one of those things you know and just going and taking the time to go and read the signs and the brochures on what they accept and how it should be separated you know that's

sw2594A-ms98-a-0056 213.317250 222.096750 how much how well they're doing yeah we do i um i i work in a uh speech interface lab at a at a at a college
sw2594A-ms98-a-0057 222.096750 233.500000 and we do basically the same thing the state of Maryland has lost asked all the colleges and universities and some of the large organizations you know if they would definitely recycle their office paper
sw2594A-ms98-a-0058 233.500000 243.018500 and the same thing you know every almost every college in Maryland is recycling office paper but you know in the giant bins around and it's surprising how much
sw2594A-ms98-a-0059 243.018500 247.375625 you never realize because that janitor comes around and empties your garbage can every night
sw2594A-ms98-a-0060 247.375625 256.713750 you don't notice until you start leaving yeah they don't pick up your recycling until it's full and you just can't believe how much paper that you uh
sw2594A-ms98-a-0061 256.713750 261.749625 reams of paper come out of an office every [laughter-day] they just asked me to recycle
sw2594A-ms98-a-0062 261.749625 262.936875 um-hum
sw2594A-ms98-a-0063 262.936875 264.001375 [silence]

sw2594A-ms98-a-0066 269.456625 277.271875 yeah so i think hopefully if you know i guess a lot of the large organizations probably TI did they advertise on television how successful they are
sw2594A-ms98-a-0067 277.271875 278.482875 some
sw2594A-ms98-a-0068 278.482875 279.700000 yeah

sw2594A-ms98-a-0079 300.279500 302.575125 right yeah that would probably be true

sw2594A-ms98-a-0081 304.598000 305.305125 um-hum
sw2594A-ms98-a-0082 305.305125 315.021500 yeah because i know that some of the large industries here will advertise on television you know they'll jus[t]- come up and say you know they'll show you they'll to encourage to encourage recycling
sw2594A-ms98-a-0083 315.021500 323.462375 they'll say and here those of us at Dalmarva Power which is our power company you know we now recycle forty five percent of our solid waste and they
sw2594A-ms98-a-0084 323.462375 332.928000 and uh we do this for the community they put those on so i so i think you know we're probably reaching a successful stage and and just with voluntary i think

sw2594A-ms98-a-0092 358.053500 361.119000 right yeah we weren't concerned yeah that's true

sw2594A-ms98-a-0098 371.939000 376.982125 yeah i i think really probably what hit people's you know i know that here in the up in the uh
sw2594A-ms98-a-0099 376.982125 385.625500 uh the the New England area and also in in Pennsylvania Ohio and New York the just run all of a sudden we're out of landfill
sw2594A-ms98-a-0100 385.625500 393.436375 and then they're saying w[e]- we estimate this landfill will be ov[er]- will be full in two years unless we cut back
sw2594A-ms98-a-0101 393.436375 402.520875 and even then you know we're really running out of space so i think that that became that all of a sudden really hit home that there's no longer landfill space in some of the more crowded states
sw2594A-ms98-a-0102 402.520875 410.548625 so what you know and n[o]- no other state i'm sure Texas probably still has some landfill space they're not going to voluntarily say hey ship your garbage here
sw2594A-ms98-a-0103 410.548625 419.361375 so you know realistically you know we ha[d]- we really had to start we have to start recycling in some some uh geographic areas it's really tough
sw2594A-ms98-a-0104 419.361375 423.310125 [silence]
sw2594A-ms98-a-0105 423.310125 424.430000 um-hum

sw2594A-ms98-a-0109 433.681250 436.096250 right yeah though well
sw2594A-ms98-a-0110 436.096250 444.262500 well in some ways i guess it it doesn't become really cost savings until you have an industry around it you know because i know that like in Pennsylvania
sw2594A-ms98-a-0111 444.262500 449.703500 they require them to um put their newspaper for recycling but
sw2594A-ms98-a-0112 449.703500 456.651125 the {deinking} process that they have to they use to take the ink out of the newspaper so it can be reused
sw2594A-ms98-a-0113 456.651125 466.343000 um is very expensive and also it w[aste]- it produces a a waste a um a liquid waste that they don't know what to do with yet
sw2594A-ms98-a-0114 466.343000 469.492500 so even some aspects of recycling
sw2594A-ms98-a-0115 469.492500 473.534250 still have cost yeah cost efficient yet yeah
sw2594A-ms98-a-0116 473.534250 486.315250 so but others you know like tin cans and plastics are are really uh efficient you know they uh they m[elt]- they melt on quickly and can be you know just because of the heating and things yeah and glass yeah
sw2594A-ms98-a-0117 486.315250 490.030875 so y[eah]- it really is surprising that people haven't noticed it before
sw2594A-ms98-a-0118 490.030875 490.932250 um-hum

sw2594A-ms98-a-0128 520.287000 524.018125 the water table you know they really pollute quickly and
sw2594A-ms98-a-0129 524.018125 531.710875 you know one i was what reading some place th[at]- the brake fluid you put brake fluid normally comes in just small little pint containers
sw2594A-ms98-a-0130 531.710875 538.106000 that one pint of brake fluid can contaminate so many gallons of water you know like hundreds of gallons of water 
sw2594A-ms98-a-0131 538.106000 543.423500 so it's one of those things that they really um and you wonder you know with all these oil spills
sw2594A-ms98-a-0132 543.423500 551.167625 how how [laughter-terrible] [laughter-that] [laughter-is] yeah how terrible that is so we'll have to we'll have to keep our eyes on all that i guess
