sw2594B-ms98-a-0071 331.851125 337.970875 right well even i mean in the kid's schools i mean they do things to try and recycle and
sw2594B-ms98-a-0072 337.970875 351.983500 i know my kids um like if they see litter on the ground they pick it up and say oh look at that somebody is not saving the earth you [laughter-know] so i mean the kids i mean they're really trying to educate all ages you know and it's good to start the kids real young
sw2594B-ms98-a-0073 351.983500 360.316125 and stuff like that because i mean when i was a kid they never did stuff like that i mean it's like nobody was concerned about it you know and it's like
sw2594B-ms98-a-0074 360.316125 369.344250 you know it's like all of a sudden when there's noticeable things saying hey you know we're ruining the earth you know and now everybody is doing something about which is good
sw2594B-ms98-a-0075 369.344250 374.158750 [noise] but how come we weren't doing this say twenty years ago [laughter] you know

sw2594B-ms98-a-0109 489.180750 496.931750 yeah that's true and even i i noticed that a lot of gas stations are telling you to recycle your oil
sw2594B-ms98-a-0110 496.931750 508.190000 and i mean that kind of surprises me [laughter] i mean you know because once oil gets so you know thick and yucky you'd wonder how they could you know clean that up enough to use it again but they can
sw2594B-ms98-a-0111 508.190000 512.150000 um i don't know how cost efficient that would be i guess

sw2594B-ms98-a-0123 559.681000 564.405875 you know i think it's really catching on you know i i think that
sw2594B-ms98-a-0124 564.405875 569.623500 i'm not sure if it i don't know i think it's a good idea to make it mandatory
sw2594B-ms98-a-0125 569.623500 582.075375 um [vocalized-noise] because like we were asking some people that live in um North Dakota well are you saving your you know are you recycling and they said well we're not forced to do it yet so no
sw2594B-ms98-a-0126 582.075375 595.015375 you know so i mean i don't know i think that if people are forced if the people are not forced to do it they may not you know i mean i don't know i think a lot of people s[till]- s[till]- still will but [laughter]
