sw2595A-ms98-a-0069 304.886500 308.327000 and i happened to hit the rim of the tire
sw2595A-ms98-a-0070 308.327000 314.339500 it made like a little semicircular incision on my plastic bumper
sw2595A-ms98-a-0071 314.339500 324.897500 right and and and kind of put little fissures on the on the paint of the bumper because it's plastic so when it bent you know when the plastic bent it kind of cracked
sw2595A-ms98-a-0072 324.897500 329.587625 to to change that bumper covering of the plastic cover
sw2595A-ms98-a-0073 329.587625 332.059875 was going to run me five hundred bucks
sw2595A-ms98-a-0074 332.059875 334.736375 [silence]
sw2595A-ms98-a-0075 334.736375 336.266250 on my car

sw2595A-ms98-a-0077 343.167125 356.436875 they had a big big bumper they got on there big white bumper that covers like the whole bottom front of the car that that whole thing you know to be replaced and repainted would cost five hundred dollars
sw2595A-ms98-a-0078 356.436875 365.168000 and i got this guy to uh to this this uh company i don't know if you ever heard of Maaco Auto Body Shop
sw2595A-ms98-a-0079 365.168000 371.999875 i got the i talked to the owner and he said that the best thing to do if i wanted to save money was uh
sw2595A-ms98-a-0080 371.999875 383.038000 to just go ahead and since there was no major damage he could just kind of like fill in the little ridges where the where the uh rim hit
sw2595A-ms98-a-0081 383.038000 391.926125 with some like bond or something and then paint over it and it would look just like new for only two hundred bucks so i did that instead
sw2595A-ms98-a-0082 391.926125 397.020750 but and it you can't tell you can't tell the difference you know it just looks like a brand new bumper
sw2595A-ms98-a-0083 397.020750 400.082000 and it hey i saved three hundred bucks [laughter]

sw2595A-ms98-a-0098 454.741625 459.705250 it's it's pretty good it's i think it's um a bank commercial or something like that
sw2595A-ms98-a-0099 459.705250 470.164000 and uh it just kind of flashes out these uh partial sentences like you planned on and it says a new garage second car
sw2595A-ms98-a-0100 470.164000 475.604875 and then all a sudden the music in the background changes and it says but you didn't plan on it breaking down

sw2595A-ms98-a-0106 516.094875 525.474000 that's that's uh that's one thing about dealerships is you don't i don't think you get the real quality work at dealerships because they have to work with so many cars it just kind of

sw2595A-ms98-a-0114 563.105750 566.202000 yeah but i think
sw2595A-ms98-a-0115 566.202000 571.719250 yeah i think uh i think public transportation will move up though in the future
sw2595A-ms98-a-0116 571.719250 575.390750 i mean i think we pretty much phased out the bus

sw2595A-ms98-a-0118 576.487875 580.632750 but i think maybe uh you know um
sw2595A-ms98-a-0119 580.632750 587.107500 like subways you know public transportation such as subways and monorails will probably come in

sw2595A-ms98-a-0121 589.013875 595.318375 well yeah i mean not nothing like in the next ten years but more like in the next fifty to a hundred
