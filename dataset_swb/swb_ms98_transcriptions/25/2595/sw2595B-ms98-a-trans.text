sw2595B-ms98-a-0019 66.271000 71.468625 continue on but yeah i was sitting here looking at my Honda manual when i got the call

sw2595B-ms98-a-0031 106.639625 114.392625 right seems anymore you need special tools to do a lot of jobs you know and and
sw2595B-ms98-a-0032 114.392625 120.409625 i'm afraid i'll get something take it taken apart and not remember how to [laughter] get it back together
sw2595B-ms98-a-0033 120.409625 122.767125 and then i'd be in big trouble
sw2595B-ms98-a-0034 122.767125 124.172625 i do know a couple
sw2595B-ms98-a-0035 124.172625 128.459750 good shade tree mechanics and i call them once in a while for advice and
sw2595B-ms98-a-0036 128.459750 133.250000 once in a while for advice and once in a while they'll come over and say oh this is how you do it you know and i try to learn
sw2595B-ms98-a-0037 133.250000 138.924500 but i think a lot of people learn how to do maintenance from whether their father did it
sw2595B-ms98-a-0038 138.924500 143.815875 you know my didn't do much at all and didn't know much about cars and
sw2595B-ms98-a-0039 143.815875 150.165375 as a result i really didn't have that much interest to learn how to maintain fix and maintain cars
sw2595B-ms98-a-0040 150.165375 153.370875 so i didn't learn much growing up and i just
sw2595B-ms98-a-0041 153.370875 160.431000 after i we bought the cars you know and things got so expensive to take them someplace all the time
sw2595B-ms98-a-0042 160.431000 163.443375 that i decided that i better start learning you know
sw2595B-ms98-a-0043 163.443375 166.949000 [silence]
sw2595B-ms98-a-0044 166.949000 167.727125 right

sw2595B-ms98-a-0048 171.152125 177.691375 well yeah that's that's when i call some friends or something or sometimes i just take it to a place you know and they'll tell me what's wrong and i'll say
sw2595B-ms98-a-0049 177.691375 183.569500 oh it'll be this much money and i'll say oh well i'm going to think about that that sounds like too much [laughter]
sw2595B-ms98-a-0050 183.569500 188.567000 right now and so you know i got to think about that so they'll put it back together i'll take it home and then i'll
sw2595B-ms98-a-0051 188.567000 193.429250 fix it myself sometimes they charge you you know just to diagnose the problem
sw2595B-ms98-a-0052 193.429250 202.193625 some places do some don't right just depends you know how long how long it takes them to figure it out if they can just tell right away
sw2595B-ms98-a-0053 202.193625 204.805875 by just listening to it
sw2595B-ms98-a-0054 204.805875 208.382625 and then they're usually going to charge you you know
sw2595B-ms98-a-0055 208.382625 212.566375 [silence]
sw2595B-ms98-a-0056 212.566375 215.337500 uh-huh yeah right they're pretty tricky

sw2595B-ms98-a-0060 229.256750 232.967375 right that's how i figure on those things it's just not worth the
sw2595B-ms98-a-0061 232.967375 235.107250 worth it
sw2595B-ms98-a-0062 235.107250 242.171000 [silence]
sw2595B-ms98-a-0063 242.171000 243.320375 right right

sw2595B-ms98-a-0065 248.059750 250.182250 uh-huh right
sw2595B-ms98-a-0066 250.182250 256.418000 now that we have two cars i'm not as scared to play with play around because we always have the other car
sw2595B-ms98-a-0067 256.418000 258.894500 seems like i before i would get the
sw2595B-ms98-a-0068 258.894500 262.368750 car all apart and realize i needed a part you know
sw2595B-ms98-a-0069 262.368750 265.500750 and i'm calling all the neighbors and stuff trying to
sw2595B-ms98-a-0070 265.500750 271.984375 get them to give me a ride down to get my part you know because i don't have another part
sw2595B-ms98-a-0071 271.984375 279.936000 so now that we have two cars i i'm not i'm less leery about just going for it
sw2595B-ms98-a-0072 279.936000 283.831875 um no no i haven't had any problem
sw2595B-ms98-a-0073 283.831875 288.233750 yeah i know i had an estimate for that little rust spot and they wanted like three hundred bucks
sw2595B-ms98-a-0074 288.233750 289.847375 i said [laughter-forget] [laughter-it]
sw2595B-ms98-a-0075 289.847375 292.705250 i can live with it you know if the car's

sw2595B-ms98-a-0107 399.927500 402.990125 yeah well you're a student right
sw2595B-ms98-a-0108 402.990125 405.673875 so that's important [laughter]
sw2595B-ms98-a-0109 405.673875 406.945125 yeah
sw2595B-ms98-a-0110 406.945125 409.641375 it seems anymore for cars or
sw2595B-ms98-a-0111 409.641375 412.598375 they want want so much to work on a car
sw2595B-ms98-a-0112 412.598375 418.490000 we've had our car in the dealer or our van and they want they charge like forty five dollars an hour labor
sw2595B-ms98-a-0113 418.490000 420.476750 golly they're
sw2595B-ms98-a-0114 420.476750 423.319625 yeah i i
sw2595B-ms98-a-0115 423.319625 426.475375 [silence]
sw2595B-ms98-a-0116 426.475375 429.829750 right well the mechanic doesn't see that you know
sw2595B-ms98-a-0117 429.829750 433.621000 it's the owner or the dealer who sees the big bucks
sw2595B-ms98-a-0118 433.621000 436.518375 mechanic probably gets about twenty dollars an hour
sw2595B-ms98-a-0119 436.518375 438.937250 [silence]
sw2595B-ms98-a-0120 438.937250 445.896375 yeah the thing about automobiles they're so unpredictable too you know they're hard to hard to plan ahead for for things
sw2595B-ms98-a-0121 445.896375 447.014500 yeah
sw2595B-ms98-a-0122 447.014500 450.498000 [silence]
sw2595B-ms98-a-0123 450.498000 451.163375 uh-huh
sw2595B-ms98-a-0124 451.163375 453.083500 [silence]
sw2595B-ms98-a-0125 453.083500 454.548125 right
sw2595B-ms98-a-0126 454.548125 456.276500 no i haven't seen that one
sw2595B-ms98-a-0127 456.276500 460.030000 [silence]
sw2595B-ms98-a-0128 460.030000 460.772000 uh-huh
sw2595B-ms98-a-0129 460.772000 475.706250 [silence]
sw2595B-ms98-a-0130 475.706250 479.721625 [laughter] that's true that's true i mean it's hard to you know it's hard to say
sw2595B-ms98-a-0131 479.721625 487.947000 oh i should set aside this much money for repairs on cars because you never know it could cost you nothing or it could cost you three times as much
sw2595B-ms98-a-0132 487.947000 490.553125 it's hard to plan for those things
sw2595B-ms98-a-0133 490.553125 496.627500 and when you need to have it fixed you know a lot of times you can't just take it all over town if it uh you know
sw2595B-ms98-a-0134 496.627500 500.157125 sometime you can but on some things it's
sw2595B-ms98-a-0135 500.157125 504.900250 you're just stuck and you got to have it towed somewhere or something you just got to [noise] got to
sw2595B-ms98-a-0136 504.900250 507.902375 got to [noise] got to make a quick decision [laughter]
sw2595B-ms98-a-0137 507.902375 513.269375 i don't know i don't trust a lot of people who work on your cars too i know this one guy that works for dealerships as a
sw2595B-ms98-a-0138 513.269375 516.890500 at dealerships they replace things they don't fix
sw2595B-ms98-a-0139 516.890500 526.738250 [silence]
sw2595B-ms98-a-0140 526.738250 532.066125 so they'd just rather replace something and charge you for the new part rather than just you know fixing the part
sw2595B-ms98-a-0141 532.066125 536.790500 and the part could be probably fixed you know for a third of the price of of a new one
sw2595B-ms98-a-0142 536.790500 540.333875 but they that's dealers don't do that [laughter]
sw2595B-ms98-a-0143 540.333875 541.658625 [silence]
sw2595B-ms98-a-0144 541.658625 548.188375 oh sure sure they do and then they take your old part and sell it to some reconditioning house and make money off of that too
sw2595B-ms98-a-0145 548.188375 549.305000 you know
sw2595B-ms98-a-0146 549.305000 550.582125 [silence]
sw2595B-ms98-a-0147 550.582125 552.051750 so anyway
sw2595B-ms98-a-0148 552.051750 553.340000 [silence]
sw2595B-ms98-a-0149 553.340000 555.615875 well we got to got to have cars in this
sw2595B-ms98-a-0150 555.615875 556.674375 society
sw2595B-ms98-a-0151 556.674375 563.110000 not like uh Europe and Japan and some other countries where they have good enough public transportation where you can just
sw2595B-ms98-a-0152 563.110000 564.505875 get anywhere you
sw2595B-ms98-a-0153 564.505875 567.748125 need to go anytime you need to get there
sw2595B-ms98-a-0154 567.748125 571.890000 [silence]
sw2595B-ms98-a-0155 571.890000 573.040250 well i hope so
sw2595B-ms98-a-0156 573.040250 576.035625 [silence]
sw2595B-ms98-a-0157 576.035625 576.992875 right

sw2595B-ms98-a-0159 583.171250 583.926125 uh-huh
sw2595B-ms98-a-0160 583.926125 587.541750 [silence]
sw2595B-ms98-a-0161 587.541750 590.377125 right right but it it's going to be a while i think but
sw2595B-ms98-a-0162 590.377125 596.667625 [silence]
sw2595B-ms98-a-0163 596.667625 598.779875 if i had a car uh the
sw2595B-ms98-a-0164 598.779875 599.611500 a bus
