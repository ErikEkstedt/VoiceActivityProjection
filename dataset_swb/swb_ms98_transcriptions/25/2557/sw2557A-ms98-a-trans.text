sw2557A-ms98-a-0008 20.024625 27.262500 yeah we see them once in a while a couple of times a year at least and the ones in Pittsburgh of course we see more often
sw2557A-ms98-a-0009 27.262500 29.138000 so uh
sw2557A-ms98-a-0010 29.138000 31.028750 okay
sw2557A-ms98-a-0011 31.028750 33.397500 i'm ready to go [noise]
sw2557A-ms98-a-0012 33.397500 37.680000 [silence]
sw2557A-ms98-a-0013 37.680000 47.443875 well they've been trying different things one one of the biggest problems seems to be we don't they don't have anyplace to put some of the things that need recycled
sw2557A-ms98-a-0014 47.443875 48.862375 right now
sw2557A-ms98-a-0015 48.862375 54.478000 we've recycled glass for year[s]- be[cause]- years because we have a glass industry in our community
sw2557A-ms98-a-0016 54.478000 55.478125 [silence]
sw2557A-ms98-a-0017 55.478125 56.580500 Owens

sw2557A-ms98-a-0019 58.428875 59.624000 um
sw2557A-ms98-a-0020 59.624000 69.494875 so glass has been recycled for a long time uh we have a cycling area set up here at our house the Boy Scouts have and they've done that for years
sw2557A-ms98-a-0021 69.494875 78.583250 uh the stores are recycling their plastic bags now you can take them back in and they have bins to collect those uh
sw2557A-ms98-a-0022 78.583250 80.941000 the aluminum cans
sw2557A-ms98-a-0023 80.941000 94.918625 they try to do the uh newspapers and uh they had to close their area down because_1 they couldn't sell it they were what they were doing was shredding it and trying to sell it to farmers for bedding for their animals
sw2557A-ms98-a-0024 94.918625 111.011250 that type of thing and that didn't work but but somebody told me that they were charging as much for it as they did for straw which is why they couldn't sell it you know because_1 the farmers would buy the straw if it's a you know similar price
sw2557A-ms98-a-0025 111.011250 114.095875 [vocalized-noise] 
sw2557A-ms98-a-0026 114.095875 126.946875 okay i think by this fall it's going to be required that the town of Clarion which we live nearby will have mandatory recycling started
sw2557A-ms98-a-0027 126.946875 128.806875 so
sw2557A-ms98-a-0028 128.806875 133.494750 uh mainly the glass the aluminum the plastics
sw2557A-ms98-a-0029 133.494750 134.848875 uh
sw2557A-ms98-a-0030 134.848875 137.359375 [silence]
sw2557A-ms98-a-0031 137.359375 145.509250 well we're working hard on it because we're fighting also in our area a large hazardous waste incinerator
sw2557A-ms98-a-0032 145.509250 149.214750 which we do not want built and uh
sw2557A-ms98-a-0033 149.214750 154.793875 we would like industry to do more before they build these big huge incinerators
sw2557A-ms98-a-0034 154.793875 157.044000 and uh
sw2557A-ms98-a-0035 157.044000 163.257875 we we just feel they should they should offer industry some incentives to do more reducing of their
sw2557A-ms98-a-0036 163.257875 165.558625 waste products and reusing them
sw2557A-ms98-a-0037 165.558625 172.329625 because_1 some of those companies that are doing it have save money eventually at first apparently it costs more to get started
sw2557A-ms98-a-0038 172.329625 176.396750 but once they get established then it's a money saving thing
sw2557A-ms98-a-0039 176.396750 183.547625 [silence]
sw2557A-ms98-a-0040 183.547625 185.449750 and what is TI

sw2557A-ms98-a-0103 451.887875 455.230500 in between two of our main water sheds
sw2557A-ms98-a-0104 455.230500 457.796500 that feed the Clarion Ri[ver]- River
sw2557A-ms98-a-0105 457.796500 466.923875 and uh we we just we just don't want it anyplace [laughter] we feel that we that they should give businesses more incentives
sw2557A-ms98-a-0106 466.923875 474.818375 to do more recycling and more reduction and and more reuse and all those things that could be done
sw2557A-ms98-a-0107 474.818375 476.687625 we we just don't think
sw2557A-ms98-a-0108 476.687625 481.925000 we don't think some of the politicians are really interested in our best interests
sw2557A-ms98-a-0109 481.925000 483.265375 and uh

sw2557A-ms98-a-0122 516.563625 528.501375 we're we're going to pay for that that whether we pay industry or pay we we've already paid industry for like these super fund that's cleaning up we paid industry for it
sw2557A-ms98-a-0123 528.501375 538.970750 we pay all help to pay to have them haul it away from their place and where they put it now they found it's not a safe place it's leaked and now they have to clean those up
sw2557A-ms98-a-0124 538.970750 548.161875 and it's our money that's cleaning this stuff up and now they want to put it in they burn it and that will make another hazardous dump
sw2557A-ms98-a-0125 548.161875 561.829625 and eventually they'll have to do something with that we'll pay for it again so why not pay industry this is my feeling why not pay industry a little more and reduce it you know and and not have as much of it
