sw2557B-ms98-a-0044 176.967000 184.956375 well our company does some things all of which i couldn't even tell you about i don't know all of them_1 but
sw2557B-ms98-a-0045 184.956375 187.760000 uh Texas Instruments
sw2557B-ms98-a-0046 187.760000 189.131625 [vocalized-noise]
sw2557B-ms98-a-0047 189.131625 194.311625 [silence]
sw2557B-ms98-a-0048 194.311625 200.565750 well i- i was just curious as how you got hooked up with this this speech type of thing if
sw2557B-ms98-a-0049 200.565750 206.229500 [silence]
sw2557B-ms98-a-0050 206.229500 208.215375 oh and he
sw2557B-ms98-a-0051 208.215375 209.627750 yeah
sw2557B-ms98-a-0052 209.627750 221.408250 well here at work um each one of us has two trash baskets in our office and one of those is designed for any kind of paper products that um they want
sw2557B-ms98-a-0053 221.408250 226.542750 to use you know for recycling they can't deal with every type
sw2557B-ms98-a-0054 226.542750 232.029625 [silence]
sw2557B-ms98-a-0055 232.029625 246.157500 well i guess i don't know specifically except that uh for the paper that they want to recycle they do not want any newspaper um and
sw2557B-ms98-a-0056 246.157500 259.678000 things like candy wrappers or uh that type of thing let's see i have a list here um they don't want lunch sacks or brown envelopes
sw2557B-ms98-a-0057 259.678000 262.538500 uh phone books
sw2557B-ms98-a-0058 262.538500 274.758500 so there are you know a lot of kinds of things that they don't want but then any kind of computer paper letters uh booklets they'll even take things that are bound
sw2557B-ms98-a-0059 274.758500 288.397625 um and it doesn't all have to be like white they'll take colored folders and and uh even some of those can have plastic tabs on them so it's it's hard to kind of figure out
sw2557B-ms98-a-0060 288.397625 296.476750 you know which things are the right ones i mean i i'll frequently have to look at the list if it's something that i don't throw away all the time
sw2557B-ms98-a-0061 296.476750 305.027250 but um they do that and then we use uh different chemicals and things and i know that you know they're
sw2557B-ms98-a-0062 305.027250 313.266625 real concerned about how they take care of that sort of thing i- i don't know all the details but they're really on top of that
sw2557B-ms98-a-0063 313.266625 324.742000 and there probably some other things that i don't about because we're a real large company and i just don't have contact with them_1 but in our uh city well i live in a suburb of Dallas
sw2557B-ms98-a-0064 324.742000 335.439750 and they have initiated a newspaper recycling whereby they pick it up from your alley uh one day a week and all you have to do is bundle it
sw2557B-ms98-a-0065 335.439750 350.137875 uh all around Dallas there are a lot of recycling centers where you can take things sometimes for money um but most of those are real far away from
sw2557B-ms98-a-0066 350.137875 353.156250 like where i live at any rate
sw2557B-ms98-a-0067 353.156250 367.388125 very inconvenient and um it's just you know hasn't been very practical to get into a lot of those things if they would make it something where they you know would pick it up at the curb or at least
sw2557B-ms98-a-0068 367.388125 373.622250 make it you know down the street and up the corner type of thing uh
sw2557B-ms98-a-0069 373.622250 383.225625 yeah that wouldn't be so bad um our grocery store like yours will take the uh plastic bags and they'll also take the the paper bags back
sw2557B-ms98-a-0070 383.225625 384.368625 [silence]
sw2557B-ms98-a-0071 384.368625 386.182250 but um
sw2557B-ms98-a-0072 386.182250 387.376500 [silence]
sw2557B-ms98-a-0073 387.376500 397.813500 uh you mentioned the uh glass type of stuff the reason i ask you about that is years ago and it it changed names somewhere along the line but
sw2557B-ms98-a-0074 397.813500 402.497875 um my dad used to work for Knox Glass in Knox Pennsylvania
sw2557B-ms98-a-0075 402.497875 406.143875 oh really yeah it's
sw2557B-ms98-a-0076 406.143875 408.040875 [silence]
sw2557B-ms98-a-0077 408.040875 414.254750 yeah they were taken over by Glass Containers years ago and but he worked for them for like thirty one years
sw2557B-ms98-a-0078 414.254750 421.666500 and used to travel up there to Knox quite a bit and and i even did once when i was a child you know so
sw2557B-ms98-a-0079 421.666500 423.127750 [silence]
sw2557B-ms98-a-0080 423.127750 424.501000 oh really
sw2557B-ms98-a-0081 424.501000 425.642625 [silence]
sw2557B-ms98-a-0082 425.642625 432.419125 yeah we i was looking through a photo album not long ago and they had had some pictures and things in there of Knox
sw2557B-ms98-a-0083 432.419125 439.399375 but uh i guess that's about it you know as far as what goes on that i know about
sw2557B-ms98-a-0084 439.399375 456.981750 [silence]
sw2557B-ms98-a-0085 456.981750 458.168375 um
sw2557B-ms98-a-0086 458.168375 474.440750 [silence]
sw2557B-ms98-a-0087 474.440750 475.582125 yeah

sw2557B-ms98-a-0092 494.292125 496.936500 [silence]
sw2557B-ms98-a-0093 496.936500 505.079250 well i think probably more people you know would participate if they just made it a little easier and like you say make it um
sw2557B-ms98-a-0094 505.079250 518.068750 better for companies to do these things get involved in it without huge cost to them because obviously no one wants to spend a lot of money just to deal with trash [laughter] you know
sw2557B-ms98-a-0095 518.068750 519.917625 [silence]
sw2557B-ms98-a-0096 519.917625 521.999125 yeah that's true
sw2557B-ms98-a-0097 521.999125 540.544375 [silence]
sw2557B-ms98-a-0098 540.544375 541.980750 that's right
sw2557B-ms98-a-0099 541.980750 547.112375 [silence]
sw2557B-ms98-a-0100 547.112375 548.451000 um-hum

sw2557B-ms98-a-0104 557.571000 559.006375 um-hum
sw2557B-ms98-a-0105 559.006375 561.222750 [silence]
sw2557B-ms98-a-0106 561.222750 568.895500 also probably look at packaging and that sort of thing we don't we don't need three quarters of what we get
sw2557B-ms98-a-0107 568.895500 572.006625 [silence]
sw2557B-ms98-a-0108 572.006625 574.205500 i uh that's their marketing
sw2557B-ms98-a-0109 574.205500 578.842125 [silence]
sw2557B-ms98-a-0110 578.842125 580.052250 well
sw2557B-ms98-a-0111 580.052250 587.586500 [silence]
sw2557B-ms98-a-0112 587.586500 597.358250 yeah i i'm guess our city you know in picking them up must take them somewhere else and get something for them
sw2557B-ms98-a-0113 597.358250 599.673125 but i don't know that it's a big money
