sw2567B-ms98-a-0002 3.935250 5.759750 i don't think we have one
sw2567B-ms98-a-0003 5.759750 12.900000 [laughter] yeah i was going to say it's kind of hard to have have an opinion we seem to uh whoever screams the loudest
sw2567B-ms98-a-0004 12.900000 18.059375 or whoever we happen to give the most money to at that particular time we seem to support
sw2567B-ms98-a-0005 18.059375 28.151750 without regard whether there is a democracy or a anarchy or anything else
sw2567B-ms98-a-0006 28.151750 33.234750 [silence]
sw2567B-ms98-a-0007 33.234750 39.782125 well oh yeah and then of course there was there was the uh in Columbia with the drug lords but we just
sw2567B-ms98-a-0008 39.782125 41.738875 talked a lot we didn't actually do anything
sw2567B-ms98-a-0009 41.738875 44.415625 [silence]
sw2567B-ms98-a-0010 44.415625 47.411875 i'm actually surprised at anything in Central America along with Panama
sw2567B-ms98-a-0011 47.411875 49.491375 i'm just kind of surprised we did that
sw2567B-ms98-a-0012 49.491375 52.527375 [silence]
sw2567B-ms98-a-0013 52.527375 56.033250 especially after our friend Jimmy Carter gave it away anyway
sw2567B-ms98-a-0014 56.033250 57.523250 [silence]
sw2567B-ms98-a-0015 57.523250 61.710000 but i guess they had to finally do something actually Bush has been better at that than i thought
sw2567B-ms98-a-0016 61.710000 65.153500 he has a little more [vocalized-noise] a little more of a stand on policy than i thought he would
sw2567B-ms98-a-0017 65.153500 68.019125 i always considered him kind of a wimp
sw2567B-ms98-a-0018 68.019125 71.118875 yeah Reagan is kind of mu[sh]- mush mouth
sw2567B-ms98-a-0019 71.118875 71.781750 [vocalized-noise]
sw2567B-ms98-a-0020 71.781750 77.636750 but but i guess most of the policy that we're using now is uh a combination of Reagan and Carter
sw2567B-ms98-a-0021 77.636750 81.412875 neither [vocalized-noise] much as you know policy makers
sw2567B-ms98-a-0022 81.412875 95.963375 [silence]
sw2567B-ms98-a-0023 95.963375 102.474250 uh yeah we have so far but w[e]- we r[eally]- really haven't of course we really haven't taken on the drug lords yet
sw2567B-ms98-a-0024 102.474250 103.974750 [silence]
sw2567B-ms98-a-0025 103.974750 106.604625 i'd be interested to see if we do that
sw2567B-ms98-a-0026 106.604625 116.821750 [silence]
sw2567B-ms98-a-0027 116.821750 118.958625 well we did in Panama we did in 
sw2567B-ms98-a-0028 118.958625 140.095375 Saudi Arabia 
sw2567B-ms98-a-0029 140.095375 142.118875 it could be an interesting
sw2567B-ms98-a-0030 142.118875 144.306250 interesting problem 
sw2567B-ms98-a-0031 144.306250 148.737875 i don't know if they could do it or not did you read Tom Clancy's A Clear and Present Danger
sw2567B-ms98-a-0032 148.737875 149.722625 [silence] 
sw2567B-ms98-a-0033 149.722625 154.409250 i think you need to pick that up and read it it's quite uh it's it's quite interesting it addresses the problem
sw2567B-ms98-a-0034 154.409250 156.150500 [silence]
sw2567B-ms98-a-0035 156.150500 157.049875 um-hum
sw2567B-ms98-a-0036 157.049875 160.647625 actually he he wrote that prior to the uh Med[ellin]-
sw2567B-ms98-a-0037 160.647625 163.394500 Medellin Cartel being exposed
sw2567B-ms98-a-0038 163.394500 166.940250 it was on the stands prior to that time it it's quite timely
sw2567B-ms98-a-0039 166.940250 172.692875 and either he knows somebody or he has a real good real good imagination because_1 its it hits pretty close to home 
sw2567B-ms98-a-0040 172.692875 174.880125 [silence]
sw2567B-ms98-a-0041 174.880125 179.709250 but i don't think we're going to have much of a choice in e[ither]- either Central or South America
sw2567B-ms98-a-0042 179.709250 213.255750 [silence]
sw2567B-ms98-a-0043 213.255750 221.322750 um yeah i think we realize it's failed we just don't we just [noise] don't nobody wants to make the nobody wants to make the uh unpopular decision of going in and invading
sw2567B-ms98-a-0044 221.322750 222.752000 [silence]
sw2567B-ms98-a-0045 222.752000 227.908000 we still there's still [vocalized-noise] th[ere's]- there's still too many Kennedys and [vocalized-noise] and Udalls all up there 
sw2567B-ms98-a-0046 227.908000 231.110500 [silence]
sw2567B-ms98-a-0047 231.110500 234.357375 there's too many liberals in control they can't agree on anything
sw2567B-ms98-a-0048 234.357375 235.624500 [silence]
sw2567B-ms98-a-0049 235.624500 238.269500 and they have blinders on as far as the policy goes
sw2567B-ms98-a-0050 238.269500 239.317250 [silence]
sw2567B-ms98-a-0051 239.317250 246.726625 as long as somebody's getting killed as long as nobody knows about it it's okay but but the minute it hit hits the paper then of course the Kennedys and the and the Udalls and uh 
sw2567B-ms98-a-0052 246.726625 247.953250 [silence]
sw2567B-ms98-a-0053 247.953250 252.060000 the Dawes from Georgia all stand up and scream and yell about what a horrible thing it is
sw2567B-ms98-a-0054 252.060000 252.855500 [silence] 
sw2567B-ms98-a-0055 252.855500 257.203625 course these are the same people that also drown [vocalized-noise] the [vocalized-noise] and stuff like that you know 
sw2567B-ms98-a-0056 257.203625 258.301250 [silence]
sw2567B-ms98-a-0057 258.301250 261.137625 but i guess it automa[tic]- i guess it's automatic respective
sw2567B-ms98-a-0058 261.137625 262.786625 [silence]
sw2567B-ms98-a-0059 262.786625 266.811750 yeah you know the people have a right to know except about what it about what concerns them 
sw2567B-ms98-a-0060 266.811750 267.333000 [silence] 
sw2567B-ms98-a-0061 267.333000 271.830750 and these are the people that make the foreign policy and it it's it's probably basically uh 
sw2567B-ms98-a-0062 271.830750 278.509250 i would not be surprised if the Kennedy Foundation or some of those don't have a lot of uh financial holdings in in Central and South America
sw2567B-ms98-a-0063 278.509250 279.640250 [silence]
sw2567B-ms98-a-0064 279.640250 283.014500 considering the Kennedys made all their money off bootleg whiskey anyway
sw2567B-ms98-a-0065 283.014500 284.151000 [silence]
sw2567B-ms98-a-0066 284.151000 286.775250 every time you drink Scotch you're paying Kennedys
sw2567B-ms98-a-0067 286.775250 288.518000 [silence]
sw2567B-ms98-a-0068 288.518000 290.355500 good don't ever drink Scotch it's terrible
sw2567B-ms98-a-0069 290.355500 292.706375 i quit drinking Scotch when i found out about that
sw2567B-ms98-a-0070 292.706375 298.287125 but anyway but uh as far as as far as you know Central and South America we our policy pretty much uh
sw2567B-ms98-a-0071 298.287125 302.270000 it depends on who we're what government we're buying down there at the particular time
sw2567B-ms98-a-0072 302.270000 303.242250 [silence] 
sw2567B-ms98-a-0073 303.242250 314.095500 [silence]

sw2567B-ms98-a-0075 315.165000 320.772625 [silence]
sw2567B-ms98-a-0076 320.772625 330.857250 although we do need to do something about you know of course in Nicaragua and around there with the Sandinistas and the Contras that's been going on for years but then hell it's probably still be going on long after we're dead it'll still be the same thing
sw2567B-ms98-a-0077 330.857250 331.573125 [silence] 
sw2567B-ms98-a-0078 331.573125 333.205125 those people down there don't really

sw2567B-ms98-a-0080 335.698500 338.571875 well i think basically they can't figure out what they want down there
sw2567B-ms98-a-0081 338.571875 339.845625 [silence]
sw2567B-ms98-a-0082 339.845625 345.451000 if you give everybody what they wanted there [vocalized-noise] is a complete democracy those people wouldn't know how to react because they have no education
sw2567B-ms98-a-0083 345.451000 354.711375 [silence]
sw2567B-ms98-a-0084 354.711375 357.867625 it's all tradition it's all traditional they have to
