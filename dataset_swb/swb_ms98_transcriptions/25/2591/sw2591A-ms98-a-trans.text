sw2591A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 3.664125 the uh whole savings and loan thing seems to be uh
sw2591A-ms98-a-0002 3.664125 12.305875 a bit of a system whereby the the natural human greed was able to flourish and some people were able to do some things that
sw2591A-ms98-a-0003 12.305875 22.767250 that uh they they felt that that since the government was backing them_1 they could just uh go ahead and make these transactions and make these loans and get all this money as it were
sw2591A-ms98-a-0004 22.767250 36.679125 and it was rather difficult to catch all if if any of the people that were really responsible for it and even those who were caught didn't seem to get get much in the way of punishment as far as getting a restitution made
sw2591A-ms98-a-0005 36.679125 46.139000 so it just seems like a a really set up you know the whole thing was set up to to be abused and so human nature did so
sw2591A-ms98-a-0006 46.139000 134.551625 [silence]
sw2591A-ms98-a-0007 134.551625 137.965000 yeah there were quite a few down here mainly by
sw2591A-ms98-a-0008 137.965000 151.776625 just because of the sheer numbers that were here as of you know the and the chances of getting a bad one would be greater just out of the sheer population of them being here and the whole problem seemed to start start toward uh
sw2591A-ms98-a-0009 151.776625 162.608375 not that California was the instigator of it but it seemed to start out that way and then then work its way here and it wasn't kind of funny that it wasn't a national problem until it hit the east coast
sw2591A-ms98-a-0010 162.608375 170.764125 you [laughter-know] when it started hitting the big New York banks and the up then it became a nationwide problem and Congress got to do something but
sw2591A-ms98-a-0011 170.764125 177.127000 uh Texas is on basically on the way to recovery as far as uh the banking industry goes and they
sw2591A-ms98-a-0012 177.127000 207.362250 [silence]
sw2591A-ms98-a-0013 207.362250 208.540875 um-hum
sw2591A-ms98-a-0014 208.540875 223.754750 [silence]
sw2591A-ms98-a-0015 223.754750 224.870000 right
sw2591A-ms98-a-0016 224.870000 230.043500 [silence]
sw2591A-ms98-a-0017 230.043500 231.350625 um-hum
sw2591A-ms98-a-0018 231.350625 287.459375 [silence]
sw2591A-ms98-a-0019 287.459375 288.466125 um-hum
sw2591A-ms98-a-0020 288.466125 299.982250 [silence]
sw2591A-ms98-a-0021 299.982250 310.148125 well part of the problem as i see it uh my family's involved in [laughter] in both industries as it were i've i've got a grandfather that was in the
sw2591A-ms98-a-0022 310.148125 316.596625 S and L back in the sixties and the seventies and in another part of Texas and in a uh
sw2591A-ms98-a-0023 316.596625 317.373000 my
sw2591A-ms98-a-0024 317.373000 321.268000 immediate parents were both in banking as it were and so uh we've
sw2591A-ms98-a-0025 321.268000 330.629250 we've kept up with the industry as it were and the the feeling has been in some of the discussions that that get started on that topic has been that
sw2591A-ms98-a-0026 330.629250 342.384125 you know we went through the the bad times of a number of bad loans and fortunately the the banks and the S and Ls that uh our family were associated with really didn't have that much problem they were fairly conservative and
sw2591A-ms98-a-0027 342.384125 349.308875 they just had to ride out the storm with the the reputational problems that came with the the news media as it were and
sw2591A-ms98-a-0028 349.308875 350.583125 uh
sw2591A-ms98-a-0029 350.583125 362.475875 there were a number of banks that made the bad loans and basically it's been a good weeding out process there's just been a lot of people a lot of banks a lot of whole organizations that were going to make these kinds of loans
sw2591A-ms98-a-0030 362.475875 363.868250 and
sw2591A-ms98-a-0031 363.868250 376.482500 and they are no longer in business uh so you know you you have some all your bank failures that the government's having to take over you know that's gone up in the hundred and twenty or thirty or so for the state
sw2591A-ms98-a-0032 376.482500 381.664125 yeah and that's pretty well leveled off and and the that's
sw2591A-ms98-a-0033 381.664125 385.618125 yeah yeah i don't think there's going to be that many more of them_1 i- i would
sw2591A-ms98-a-0034 385.618125 400.223500 [silence]
sw2591A-ms98-a-0035 400.223500 402.694750 right right there's just not that many m[ore]-
sw2591A-ms98-a-0036 402.694750 407.603750 [silence]
sw2591A-ms98-a-0037 407.603750 418.613125 well it's hard to say how many more bad bad systems or bad apples there are out in the system but i would i'd be willing to bet that uh it shouldn't be more than a couple more years tha[t]- that
sw2591A-ms98-a-0038 418.613125 420.049625 [silence]
sw2591A-ms98-a-0039 420.049625 421.424000 well the
sw2591A-ms98-a-0040 421.424000 427.894250 as far as as far as not having this getting over this peak as it is now uh there's still going to be an unusual
sw2591A-ms98-a-0041 427.894250 437.276625 you know it depends on how far back you want to go let's say if you went back ten years and said here's a failure rate we could live with well then it may take us three to five years to get back to that level of failure
sw2591A-ms98-a-0042 437.276625 445.688125 but if you want to just say we're over the hump and we're starting to get better i think in a couple of years it'll be quite obvious that we're over the hump and getting better
sw2591A-ms98-a-0043 445.688125 455.024625 [silence]
sw2591A-ms98-a-0044 455.024625 456.282500 um-hum
sw2591A-ms98-a-0045 456.282500 470.167875 [silence]
sw2591A-ms98-a-0046 470.167875 472.778875 i'm not sure if uh
sw2591A-ms98-a-0047 472.778875 511.075500 [silence]
sw2591A-ms98-a-0048 511.075500 512.266500 right
sw2591A-ms98-a-0049 512.266500 520.089000 [silence]
sw2591A-ms98-a-0050 520.089000 526.797500 well like one guy i heard just talking earlier this week on the topic was saying that that there wasn't any one given
sw2591A-ms98-a-0051 526.797500 528.452250 uh you know sort of like a uh
sw2591A-ms98-a-0052 528.452250 533.634750 s[uit]- guy making a uh suit for you it it's custom made to the individual situation if you
sw2591A-ms98-a-0053 533.634750 538.658875 you don't try to find well write off all these to the government or have have the
sw2591A-ms98-a-0054 538.658875 553.520500 the entire uh bank failure covered by the government so you you take each individual situation yeah and if you can find a foreign investor or if you can find any investor that'll that'll finance i guess that's what the majority of the uh RTC is doing is trying to
sw2591A-ms98-a-0055 553.520500 561.128500 to resolve all these individual cases in any way possible i mean they're looking for
sw2591A-ms98-a-0056 561.128500 581.832375 [silence]
sw2591A-ms98-a-0057 581.832375 596.738375 well i was i was talking with another gentleman about that same topic it's hard to get a feel for what's going on in a nationwide uh system like that when the news media reports the segments that they report you know you hear
sw2591A-ms98-a-0058 596.738375 599.050875 yeah you hear things like uh th[e]-
