sw2591B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 37.170500 [silence]
sw2591B-ms98-a-0002 37.170500 38.641000 yeah i think the
sw2591B-ms98-a-0003 38.641000 43.569750 [silence]
sw2591B-ms98-a-0004 43.569750 44.811500 oh yeah
sw2591B-ms98-a-0005 44.811500 45.924750 [silence]
sw2591B-ms98-a-0006 45.924750 59.278625 yeah i think the government is it's own worst enemy about the time it was all going on they were trying to run a loose monetary policy anyhow to stimulate the economy and plus they had cut back on the way of government regulators to even investigate or keep a watchdog on the whole industry
sw2591B-ms98-a-0007 59.278625 67.508875 and uh i think the whole economic situation was set up to uh put the savings and loans in the position they were in and they mainly the banks too
sw2591B-ms98-a-0008 67.508875 74.593875 uh economically we had gotten into pretty unsound conditions and so the idea of trying to make the money supply good and loose
sw2591B-ms98-a-0009 74.593875 81.965875 via whatever medium whether it be savings and loans or banks either one was the order of the day [noise] so needless to say they did
sw2591B-ms98-a-0010 81.965875 90.236000 and uh since they didn't really regulate it well or watch it well uh by cutting back on uh government uh uh
sw2591B-ms98-a-0011 90.236000 99.750125 uh monitoring in that respect then it did get out of hand and you're right you're absolutely right there were some people who saw the situation for what it was and they took advantage of it
sw2591B-ms98-a-0012 99.750125 107.040875 and uh because of it you and i are the main taxpayers now are going to have to pay not only for the burden of the bad investments that they made
sw2591B-ms98-a-0013 107.040875 115.727625 but we're going to have to pay for the uh mistakes in the uh uh taking advantage of the system to some of these well really when you get right down to it crooks
sw2591B-ms98-a-0014 115.727625 119.503750 uh uh took advantage of the system with
sw2591B-ms98-a-0015 119.503750 126.706125 and yeah they've seem to caught a few i i've heard on TV or read in uh the newspaper about a couple of these guys i forget the
sw2591B-ms98-a-0016 126.706125 130.133625 the name of one of them but i heard that they did uh [noise]
sw2591B-ms98-a-0017 130.133625 135.505500 prosecute him and maybe a couple of others i think you all had a major crisis down there in Texas right
sw2591B-ms98-a-0018 135.505500 155.207500 [silence]
sw2591B-ms98-a-0019 155.207500 156.290250 yeah
sw2591B-ms98-a-0020 156.290250 162.583250 [silence]
sw2591B-ms98-a-0021 162.583250 166.011000 yeah that's always interesting isn't it see he's right
sw2591B-ms98-a-0022 166.011000 167.860500 oh yeah
sw2591B-ms98-a-0023 167.860500 176.011625 [silence]
sw2591B-ms98-a-0024 176.011625 187.221000 oh i'm glad to hear that because_1 i've been concerned that the banks may be going the same direction that the savings and loans primarily because uh what got the savings and loans in trouble is the same sort of things that's beginning to get the banks in trouble
sw2591B-ms98-a-0025 187.221000 195.299125 [noise] and that was uh the real estate uh backing in investment and just building in general backing contractors and those kinds of uh corporations
sw2591B-ms98-a-0026 195.299125 207.941000 uh who were trying to build a lot of uh uh rental business space and uh mall type space and things like that and uh it looked like in the seventies that that was going to be a real booming thing uh a infinitum i guess
sw2591B-ms98-a-0027 207.941000 214.411625 and uh anybody if they just stop and use a little common sense would realize well you just can't soak up this much real estate
sw2591B-ms98-a-0028 214.411625 224.049125 uh and continue to have this kind of growth indefinitely i mean you you it's it's like anything eventually reach sort of a plateau where you've overbuilt if you're not careful
sw2591B-ms98-a-0029 224.049125 230.239875 uh and uh it it's as if uh they they went crazy just just like in gambling almost
sw2591B-ms98-a-0030 230.239875 232.713500 and th[ere]- there was no
sw2591B-ms98-a-0031 232.713500 235.118000 regulation or anything like that uh
sw2591B-ms98-a-0032 235.118000 242.110250 i- i frankly though a[nd]- a[nd]- i'm glad to hear you say what you said about Texas because_1 i have been concerned that the banking system
sw2591B-ms98-a-0033 242.110250 243.150250 [silence]
sw2591B-ms98-a-0034 243.150250 246.054750 uh which is going through some economic difficulty now
sw2591B-ms98-a-0035 246.054750 255.056500 and with all the foreign investments that they uh put money into also [noise] i i've i've been concerned that the banking system is going to find itself in dire straits
sw2591B-ms98-a-0036 255.056500 260.216250 or if they even didn't find themselves in dire straits we're going to find ourselves with so much of our money
sw2591B-ms98-a-0037 260.216250 271.201000 uh lent out to foreign owners who are willing to soak up some of this this uh capital to keep us afloat you might say hoping to make a buck off of us in interest in the future
sw2591B-ms98-a-0038 271.201000 279.121125 that uh we find our own economi[c]- economy even though it may not have slipped into so so some kind of either deflationary or inflationary depression
sw2591B-ms98-a-0039 279.121125 280.997125 uh we find ourselves having
sw2591B-ms98-a-0040 280.997125 287.962875 sold out our futures in terms of what we are going to have to pay off all this debt with to foreign investors who have the money to build to buy up all the debt
sw2591B-ms98-a-0041 287.962875 301.390125 and uh i'm glad to hear that you do you know uh how uh they're beginning to get over the feet in Texas are are is a lot of the money in loans and and the like that uh uh is that being covered by foreign investments maybe or or uh
sw2591B-ms98-a-0042 301.390125 307.101625 [silence]
sw2591B-ms98-a-0043 307.101625 308.454875 um-hum um-hum
sw2591B-ms98-a-0044 308.454875 312.919000 [silence]
sw2591B-ms98-a-0045 312.919000 314.420875 okay
sw2591B-ms98-a-0046 314.420875 341.670750 [silence]
sw2591B-ms98-a-0047 341.670750 342.990125 um-hum
sw2591B-ms98-a-0048 342.990125 346.632500 [silence]
sw2591B-ms98-a-0049 346.632500 347.892125 yeah
sw2591B-ms98-a-0050 347.892125 374.768000 [silence]
sw2591B-ms98-a-0051 374.768000 377.230500 yeah it's been quite a few every year
sw2591B-ms98-a-0052 377.230500 380.246375 [silence]
sw2591B-ms98-a-0053 380.246375 383.527625 well do you think maybe it's peaked you think yeah 
sw2591B-ms98-a-0054 383.527625 384.636250 [silence]
sw2591B-ms98-a-0055 384.636250 393.065375 so y[ou]- y[ou]- y[ou]- you would uh predict based on at least your knowledge and experience that in time we'll see the numbers of banks and maybe savings and loans too if they're still failing
sw2591B-ms98-a-0056 393.065375 394.203000 uh
sw2591B-ms98-a-0057 394.203000 401.297375 that that that the the number beginning to sort of taper off now instead of a hundred to two hundred a year you begin to see it go down to maybe fifty to a hundred a year and maybe
sw2591B-ms98-a-0058 401.297375 403.952875 what kind of [vocalized-noise] time fr[ame]- frame would you
sw2591B-ms98-a-0059 403.952875 406.086500 guess that's going to take
sw2591B-ms98-a-0060 406.086500 408.072125 to wring itself out
sw2591B-ms98-a-0061 408.072125 417.309000 [silence]
sw2591B-ms98-a-0062 417.309000 422.388375 oh you think two years i- i would have guessed five to ten but you really think two years
sw2591B-ms98-a-0063 422.388375 425.380750 [silence]
sw2591B-ms98-a-0064 425.380750 426.670500 uh-huh uh-huh
sw2591B-ms98-a-0065 426.670500 436.155250 [silence]
sw2591B-ms98-a-0066 436.155250 437.395375 oh okay
sw2591B-ms98-a-0067 437.395375 445.135875 [silence]
sw2591B-ms98-a-0068 445.135875 450.002250 well tell me w[ell]- all this all these bad loans and debts that
sw2591B-ms98-a-0069 450.002250 455.342000 uh i- i know in the case of the savings and loans we're just going to have to pick it up as American taxpayer
sw2591B-ms98-a-0070 455.342000 461.521875 but even the banks and the likes some so some of those are merging and uh uh the the
sw2591B-ms98-a-0071 461.521875 465.079750 the the basic question i'm trying get to is all this bad money
sw2591B-ms98-a-0072 465.079750 467.527625 that's essentially not going to get paid back
sw2591B-ms98-a-0073 467.527625 469.299500 how's it going to get covered
sw2591B-ms98-a-0074 469.299500 471.993750 [silence]
sw2591B-ms98-a-0075 471.993750 480.467750 i mean is inflation going to make some of it go away and the rest of it we're going to pick up the tab as taxpayers or are we going to be able to sell some of these bad loans or pick them up somehow or another
sw2591B-ms98-a-0076 480.467750 487.435875 uh uh by foreign investors uh buying pieces of our our economy like buying some of our been to some of our banks uh
sw2591B-ms98-a-0077 487.435875 495.456250 like the things that uh i forget the guy's name downtown here uh was involved in uh those two banks i think that was in Georgia or someplace 
sw2591B-ms98-a-0078 495.456250 507.077125 uh what what what how do see that this this indebtedness of which is bad loans and the like just not going to get paid back at least by the people who caused the debt
sw2591B-ms98-a-0079 507.077125 518.516750 uh you you can't just write that off completely you can write off a certain part of it i guess but you just can't just write off the whole somewhere along the line you've got to recoup some of that money some of the even if it's twenty five to fifty cents on the dollar
sw2591B-ms98-a-0080 518.516750 520.433875 ho[w]- ho[w]- how's that going to happen
sw2591B-ms98-a-0081 520.433875 552.154375 [silence]
sw2591B-ms98-a-0082 552.154375 553.417125 uh-huh
sw2591B-ms98-a-0083 553.417125 559.466375 [silence]
sw2591B-ms98-a-0084 559.466375 570.135875 how good a job do you think they're doing because_1 you know there's been quite a bit in the various news magazines up here and even the Washington Post and various places about uh how they felt that the uh the people on the committee
sw2591B-ms98-a-0085 570.135875 582.573000 were sort of selling out at uh ex[orbitantly]- exorbitantly low prices to some rather astute investors some of this had been misinter[preted]- who were tending the who were really tend to make the nice killing off that how do you how do you feel about that
sw2591B-ms98-a-0086 582.573000 594.485875 [silence]
sw2591B-ms98-a-0087 594.485875 597.321125 yeah mainly they look for the the wild news
sw2591B-ms98-a-0088 597.321125 599.050875 [silence]
