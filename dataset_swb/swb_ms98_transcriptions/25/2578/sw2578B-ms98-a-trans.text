sw2578B-ms98-a-0002 9.965125 18.745750 not [laughter-really] i'm not much of a fan of Nancy Reagan so i i don't particularly read um biographies or autobiographies
sw2578B-ms98-a-0003 18.745750 27.827500 no i haven't read too many i i'm more of a fiction and nonfiction reader that n[ot]- not of that nature though so

sw2578B-ms98-a-0005 45.955000 47.333250 yeah
sw2578B-ms98-a-0006 47.333250 62.160750 if they if they had it i don't even know that i'd probably read it even if it was at the library though you know i i just you know i'm just not really [laughter-interested] in reading about other people's lives to that degree you know unless maybe they lived a long long time ago
sw2578B-ms98-a-0007 62.160750 67.920250 for me it would be interesting to find out what life was [vocalized-noise] like you know in that period but
sw2578B-ms98-a-0008 67.920250 74.107500 not not really [laughter-interested] no
sw2578B-ms98-a-0009 74.107500 86.764250 [silence]

sw2578B-ms98-a-0013 98.607875 103.747500 [silence]
sw2578B-ms98-a-0014 103.747500 109.101000 yeah i think the last biography that i read i'm not i think it was
sw2578B-ms98-a-0015 109.101000 113.760750 was um on Lady Randolph Churchill Churchill's mother and that was excellent
sw2578B-ms98-a-0016 113.760750 124.996625 uh yeah it was it's in two parts i think the first one is called Jenny or something like that uh because that was her name and um i only got to read one part of it and i've been looking for
sw2578B-ms98-a-0017 124.996625 139.854375 you know the other half but didn't read the i read the half where she was in her later years and it was absolutely excellent and it was very descriptive of of people with money back then and uh affluents in in England uh
sw2578B-ms98-a-0018 139.854375 144.426375 uh that you know were associated to the king and all and it was
sw2578B-ms98-a-0019 144.426375 149.971875 it was really pretty fascinating and i [laughter] and that was actually a couple of years ago so
sw2578B-ms98-a-0020 149.971875 153.651375 it's it's been a [laughter-while] [laughter-since] [laughter-i've] [laughter-read] any biographies
sw2578B-ms98-a-0021 153.651375 159.629000 but i love to read i mean i'm constantly reading i read i like uh mysteries and i like
sw2578B-ms98-a-0022 159.629000 165.517500 um as far as improving myself uh i haven't read any lately but i was reading
sw2578B-ms98-a-0023 165.517500 177.052125 classical works that i hadn't read before you know that that you might have needed to read in school but that i just didn't read for some reason or another another or that you know that you can only
sw2578B-ms98-a-0024 177.052125 182.171750 read so many in school that they make a requirement of and yet there are so many out there
sw2578B-ms98-a-0025 182.171750 184.181250 that uh
sw2578B-ms98-a-0026 184.181250 192.857000 that you you know you never get a chance to read and so i said well i think it was because i read um Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities and i just
sw2578B-ms98-a-0027 192.857000 207.570000 i mean that even when i read it now it still makes me cry the ending of it and i couldn't believe i i could not believe that it took me so long to read such a good book i'd read some Dickens before but i hadn't read that one and i i was like i thought to myself
sw2578B-ms98-a-0028 207.570000 216.538875 you know what other things are out there that are that are classics you know that have withstood time and that are just excellent something's excellent about them
sw2578B-ms98-a-0029 216.538875 223.574375 whether it's the way they were written or whether it was the material they were written you know that was written about and um
sw2578B-ms98-a-0030 223.574375 226.900500 so i started reading i had this like you know
sw2578B-ms98-a-0031 226.900500 240.254625 i had a binge of [laughter] but my mother uh i was living in Bermuda at the time with my husband but my uh mother sent me you know like bookl[et]- you know uh boxes full of different books
sw2578B-ms98-a-0032 240.254625 246.018875 and uh she just would get them real cheap and stuff and send them over but she she is quite familiar with
sw2578B-ms98-a-0033 246.018875 250.914875 i guess because it seems like uh older people have much better
sw2578B-ms98-a-0034 250.914875 252.551625 um
sw2578B-ms98-a-0035 252.551625 263.201250 in their schooling they they got more of the classics than i did you know and she knows so much more of them than i do i wouldn't even know you know to go look for that author or that book
sw2578B-ms98-a-0036 263.201250 265.186875 yeah so

sw2578B-ms98-a-0048 367.196625 368.568750 yeah
sw2578B-ms98-a-0049 368.568750 375.854750 well what i do is i usually have two books at one time i have a classic which i have to work on basically you know what uh
sw2578B-ms98-a-0050 375.854750 386.622875 just depending well some authors i can just you know basically drink in but others i really do have to work at them and then um whether you know they're a foreign author or whatever
sw2578B-ms98-a-0051 386.622875 391.739625 um or if it's their style or or just understanding the material and then i
sw2578B-ms98-a-0052 391.739625 405.878625 you know it it some of those it's like i said it's like school you have to work at it but to me it's worthwhile in the end i feel good about it and i usually remember those a long time later and then i have the books that i read just
sw2578B-ms98-a-0053 405.878625 418.538750 purely for enjoyment you know i mean yeah just light reading that are [vocalized-noise] i particularly like Dick Francis books and and just some of the the authors that are uh for mysteries just you know just 
sw2578B-ms98-a-0054 418.538750 432.169875 uh purely for entertainment you know that's it i'm not really expecting to get anything out of it except to be momentarily pleased you know because i don't i can never remember the plots or anything
sw2578B-ms98-a-0055 432.169875 433.954625 later on those books
sw2578B-ms98-a-0056 433.954625 447.753375 [noise]
sw2578B-ms98-a-0057 447.753375 449.031625 yeah
sw2578B-ms98-a-0058 449.031625 452.606250 oh yeah that television it gives you everything
sw2578B-ms98-a-0059 452.606250 467.097875 so it's [vocalized-noise] basically mindless i mean all your you the only really thing you are having to use is connecting the things that they give you you know what you're hearing and your your sigh[t]- uh your sight but they give you everything else and
sw2578B-ms98-a-0060 467.097875 471.884750 it's usually the television that we see nowadays seems like that it's
sw2578B-ms98-a-0061 471.884750 475.194125 it it doesn't even have some of the underlying
sw2578B-ms98-a-0062 475.194125 476.534875 uh
sw2578B-ms98-a-0063 476.534875 477.675500 [silence]
sw2578B-ms98-a-0064 477.675500 491.076375 things to it you know that maybe the old movies and things had you know the underlying themes and stuff that maybe you had to kind of figure out or you know like with Hitchcock or something where you're you're you're expecting something or
sw2578B-ms98-a-0065 491.076375 498.233625 we[ll]- i- i don't know it just i don't really care much for TV at all i just i mean i sometimes get hooked into it
sw2578B-ms98-a-0066 498.233625 508.841875 but i really i really get mad at myself when i do because i re[alize]- i realize fully there's no really redeeming value for T TV no
sw2578B-ms98-a-0067 508.841875 519.490000 [silence]
sw2578B-ms98-a-0068 519.490000 522.234750 yeah you're developing your imagination which
sw2578B-ms98-a-0069 522.234750 534.295375 you know when you develop your imagination that can take you into a lot of other areas because you've developed uh your your your mind in in seeing things you know even if it's your own set way
sw2578B-ms98-a-0070 534.295375 539.479750 you know it's you're you're taking words and developing a picture in your mind
sw2578B-ms98-a-0071 539.479750 541.361375 so i mean
