sw2563A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.089500 [noise]
sw2563A-ms98-a-0002 0.089500 11.883250 crime in the cities and i guess in some of the rural areas too seems to be going up i don't know it'll ever go down on any steady basis uh more people more opportunities and
sw2563A-ms98-a-0003 11.883250 17.781750 somewhat of a lessened uh sensitivity toward it it's almost um
sw2563A-ms98-a-0004 17.781750 24.780625 you know it's almost expected that that's going to occur and there's not quite the shock any more especially the so-called littler
sw2563A-ms98-a-0005 24.780625 30.929250 things where people tend to steal a little time at work or steal a few supplies or
sw2563A-ms98-a-0006 30.929250 40.970500 uh the whole defense industry's had some problems in that realm even the CEO's tend to steal a little of that here and there and uh then you get into
sw2563A-ms98-a-0007 40.970500 46.489750 whole areas of crime like drug usage and organized crime and
sw2563A-ms98-a-0008 46.489750 50.466000 as far as steps to reduce it uh
sw2563A-ms98-a-0009 50.466000 60.249000 i'm not sure that there's anything that hasn't been tried we might have ought to come up with something new if we could but uh you can't keep throwing money at it and
sw2563A-ms98-a-0010 60.249000 76.692500 [silence]
sw2563A-ms98-a-0011 76.692500 78.040625 um-hum

sw2563A-ms98-a-0013 88.013750 89.599375 yeah
sw2563A-ms98-a-0014 89.599375 99.975250 it's hard to judge but uh you know just thinking back i don't seem to recall my growing up days i'm only thirty three but it uh looking back on the
sw2563A-ms98-a-0015 99.975250 106.986375 years that i played with other kids we only played so-called war you know a few times and and then uh
sw2563A-ms98-a-0016 106.986375 119.917500 yeah that kind of a deal as opposed to to uh you know hav[ing]- shooting giant cannons and all the kind of warfare that kids are playing with today you know they turn the stick into a cannon instead of a simple little gun
sw2563A-ms98-a-0017 119.917500 127.221375 [silence]
sw2563A-ms98-a-0018 127.221375 128.620375 um-hum
sw2563A-ms98-a-0019 128.620375 135.341125 [silence]
sw2563A-ms98-a-0020 135.341125 143.701250 there was another uh angle that i- i started seeing as uh the Polish situation and some of the
sw2563A-ms98-a-0021 143.701250 145.496250 Soviet uh
sw2563A-ms98-a-0022 145.496250 151.370500 countries as it were uh they started coming into the news and you started hearing about some of their
sw2563A-ms98-a-0023 151.370500 154.971875 troubles and the like and some of their their crime problems
sw2563A-ms98-a-0024 154.971875 158.911625 it made me wonder just how the
sw2563A-ms98-a-0025 158.911625 170.468000 uh outlook of the future affects people's decisions to either commit [noise] crimes or how they live or whatever uh it seems like they
sw2563A-ms98-a-0026 170.468000 177.398500 the poorer the situation or the poorer the outlook the more likely they are to commit a crime
sw2563A-ms98-a-0027 177.398500 179.234375 uh that makes sense
sw2563A-ms98-a-0028 179.234375 186.163625 [silence]
sw2563A-ms98-a-0029 186.163625 187.280000 [noise]
sw2563A-ms98-a-0030 187.280000 188.591000 um-hum
sw2563A-ms98-a-0031 188.591000 202.319125 [silence]
sw2563A-ms98-a-0032 202.319125 205.673750 yeah that's true i mean it feeds upon itself
sw2563A-ms98-a-0033 205.673750 209.435750 not only does it make the person stagnant and not very capable of
sw2563A-ms98-a-0034 209.435750 216.360000 social progress in the realm of uh earning a living in the way that the norm is uh but it
sw2563A-ms98-a-0035 216.360000 229.133125 you know makes for a habit that has to be supported at a rate that uh can't be supported by uh that person as far as working goes i mean you can't be that much into drugs and still hold down a job capable of paying for that much drugs so
sw2563A-ms98-a-0036 229.133125 231.660250 it's a vicious circle in and of itself
sw2563A-ms98-a-0037 231.660250 240.860000 there's really uh i don't know a a bit of an eye-opener i guess even to see some of the the portions of the S[tates]- United States that are
sw2563A-ms98-a-0038 240.860000 249.307250 becoming depressed economically and to see that the high schoolers that are coming out of school why even for the past two to three years
sw2563A-ms98-a-0039 249.307250 261.069375 uh there's nothing for them_1 you know uh a lot of these rural areas college wasn't even a a consideration for the majority of them_1 they kind of are confident that they could just move right on into industry
sw2563A-ms98-a-0040 261.069375 266.076250 and industry's gone from a [laughter-lot] [laughter-of] these areas and there's nothing to go into
sw2563A-ms98-a-0041 266.076250 267.886250 so they
sw2563A-ms98-a-0042 267.886250 276.265125 still feel trapped and feel you know they were looking forward to getting out on their own and getting away from whatever uh family problems they had and
sw2563A-ms98-a-0043 276.265125 284.166250 so they just turned to whatever be it drugs or be it crime or some way to make the money to get away from the situation they're in
sw2563A-ms98-a-0044 284.166250 285.792875 and
sw2563A-ms98-a-0045 285.792875 296.416500 uh i guess that's not going to do anything but spread as as uh economic hardships spread and so will the the crimes of that age group i guess
sw2563A-ms98-a-0046 296.416500 297.511500 [silence]
sw2563A-ms98-a-0047 297.511500 303.125250 i've got a a brother-in-law that's on the police force and and his uh
sw2563A-ms98-a-0048 303.125250 304.801750 wife is a uh
sw2563A-ms98-a-0049 304.801750 314.661375 nurse in an emergency room and boy when they come home from work together they have the worst stories to share i mean we spent a week with them down in Corpus Christi and
sw2563A-ms98-a-0050 314.661375 317.656375 and just the things that they have to
sw2563A-ms98-a-0051 317.656375 328.741500 uh you know Spring break's a big deal and and uh he was telling me that he had to be on the scene of an accident where five teenagers all of the them_1 [vocalized-noise] drunk uh 
sw2563A-ms98-a-0052 328.741500 333.446250 collided head on and every single one of them_1 died three in one car and two in another and
sw2563A-ms98-a-0053 333.446250 348.308250 and uh as if that wasn't bad enough the the ones that were half alive that they rushed to the hospital and she got to work on and she got to see them_1 die and uh and they just get all the world's worst situations very few [laughter-rewarding] situations uh and
sw2563A-ms98-a-0054 348.308250 349.734750 [silence]
sw2563A-ms98-a-0055 349.734750 353.671500 grim family yeah yeah and they
sw2563A-ms98-a-0056 353.671500 358.258375 fortunately they have some some success stories to share and i try to
sw2563A-ms98-a-0057 358.258375 370.205750 tell them_1 to dwell on those i can't see how they can both stand uh to live that way but they don't see much uh hope for neither one of them sees any real solution to the to the problems uh
sw2563A-ms98-a-0058 370.205750 389.551875 [silence]
sw2563A-ms98-a-0059 389.551875 390.768750 right

sw2563A-ms98-a-0061 396.215250 406.560750 yeah i meant to ask him the last time i was talking with him if uh if there are any circumstances under which they suspend the normal paperwork for just even a minor wreck because
sw2563A-ms98-a-0062 406.560750 412.036250 uh numerous times there there have been just a two car or three car incident and
sw2563A-ms98-a-0063 412.036250 420.237500 he starts his paperwork when you know he's gets there and then by the time they all cleared out and gone he's still sitting there doing paperwork on this deal and i said
sw2563A-ms98-a-0064 420.237500 429.897625 wonder what those California officers do when they have those you know twenty and thirty car pileups on the highway if it'd take a off[icers]- uh you know whole army of officers just to do the paperwork
sw2563A-ms98-a-0065 429.897625 431.293500 that's a
sw2563A-ms98-a-0066 431.293500 437.814500 [silence]
sw2563A-ms98-a-0067 437.814500 439.121500 yeah

sw2563A-ms98-a-0069 441.569625 442.877750 right
sw2563A-ms98-a-0070 442.877750 446.477375 it just be up up to something i guess that was big enough to
sw2563A-ms98-a-0071 446.477375 451.442500 to call them_1 out for well i got one one kid needing me so i'll
