sw2525B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.980000 [noise]
sw2525B-ms98-a-0002 0.980000 3.527875 all set do you want to start
sw2525B-ms98-a-0003 3.527875 4.471750 [silence]
sw2525B-ms98-a-0004 4.471750 5.913125 sure go ahead
sw2525B-ms98-a-0005 5.913125 21.245250 [silence]
sw2525B-ms98-a-0006 21.245250 22.907375 oh God
sw2525B-ms98-a-0007 22.907375 34.272000 [silence]
sw2525B-ms98-a-0008 34.272000 37.624000 do they have many buildings that have security there
sw2525B-ms98-a-0009 37.624000 52.139000 [silence]
sw2525B-ms98-a-0010 52.139000 53.480125 yeah
sw2525B-ms98-a-0011 53.480125 66.203625 yeah well i- i went to Dallas um when i worked for TI in Abilene and uh i- i'm a little familiar with the city area uh Forest Lane and you know through that off off the freeway 
sw2525B-ms98-a-0012 66.203625 78.936125 and uh it didn't seem like it was that congested in that that part you know because_1 to me where we live out here in the north east it it's there are a lot of buildings very close to each other
sw2525B-ms98-a-0013 78.936125 82.234625 and the cities are very populated with tenement housing
sw2525B-ms98-a-0014 82.234625 85.490375 where there are more than one family in a house
sw2525B-ms98-a-0015 85.490375 96.915250 [noise] and w[ith]- with the uh people that are coming into the country from other countries not knowing the language and uh they['re]- they're going to the big cities it makes it very difficult
sw2525B-ms98-a-0016 96.915250 107.421375 it really does and and i- i've seen the same thing that you're talking about uh much more crime than ever before drugs of course uh a big part of it i think
sw2525B-ms98-a-0017 107.421375 115.387625 and uh i don't know a lot of younger people you know into more violent crimes
sw2525B-ms98-a-0018 115.387625 126.381750 tha[t]- that that's really sad you know you got young boys or girls that at fourteen or twelve years old that are committing murders and no remorse what so ever
sw2525B-ms98-a-0019 126.381750 128.085625 [silence]
sw2525B-ms98-a-0020 128.085625 130.719500 yeah yeah
sw2525B-ms98-a-0021 130.719500 141.549375 it is and and i don't know if it's uh the family you know thing where they're not bonding anymore where mothers are working all the time and
sw2525B-ms98-a-0022 141.549375 146.106625 the kids aren't getting the attention that they need or the television
sw2525B-ms98-a-0023 146.106625 152.292125 and i- i really think that we're we're falling by the wayside with not incarcerating these people
sw2525B-ms98-a-0024 152.292125 153.715750 [silence]
sw2525B-ms98-a-0025 153.715750 154.960750 i uh
sw2525B-ms98-a-0026 154.960750 159.893250 [silence]
sw2525B-ms98-a-0027 159.893250 161.125750 yeah
sw2525B-ms98-a-0028 161.125750 164.389375 [silence]
sw2525B-ms98-a-0029 164.389375 165.834875 yeah
sw2525B-ms98-a-0030 165.834875 167.715875 exactly
sw2525B-ms98-a-0031 167.715875 174.839125 and an[d]- you know they had uh in fact on the news last night we were watching this uh man who lost his ten year old daughter
sw2525B-ms98-a-0032 174.839125 182.989625 he ran out to the store for a few minutes and he had left her home alone sh[e]- now ten years old she's old enough to be alone for a few minutes you know
sw2525B-ms98-a-0033 182.989625 188.971250 and while he was gone he had looked went looking for a job and stopped at the store that's what it was
sw2525B-ms98-a-0034 188.971250 197.713375 and uh someone who was in the neighborhood cleaning carpets these two men went in raped the girl murdered her
sw2525B-ms98-a-0035 197.713375 207.532000 and the whole bit and one of the men got uh i think it was seventeen years and the other one was in for uh life imprisonment
sw2525B-ms98-a-0036 207.532000 213.361625 the one that was in for the seventeen years actually served seven and he's out
sw2525B-ms98-a-0037 213.361625 214.367875 [silence]
sw2525B-ms98-a-0038 214.367875 227.244000 and the man said that you know i[f]- if it weren't for the fact that he would go to jail that he would eliminate this person himself and then go to McDonald's and have a hamburger and not thing a thing think a thing about it
sw2525B-ms98-a-0039 227.244000 233.690750 and i mean i think that what this is going to lead to is people will take things into their own hands
sw2525B-ms98-a-0040 233.690750 242.852125 and that innocent people i- i shouldn't say innocent because i mean ac[tually]- actually if they commit a crime that they're in the same circumstances but 
sw2525B-ms98-a-0041 242.852125 249.092375 the reasons that they're doing it compared to the reason someone else is in jail for it you know it's like two different things
sw2525B-ms98-a-0042 249.092375 253.575875 sometimes when you lose someone that you really love you do some crazy things
sw2525B-ms98-a-0043 253.575875 254.600000 [silence]
sw2525B-ms98-a-0044 254.600000 256.264500 i don't know
sw2525B-ms98-a-0045 256.264500 258.515500 [silence]
sw2525B-ms98-a-0046 258.515500 261.417375 i- i like the idea
sw2525B-ms98-a-0047 261.417375 265.551125 that uh if someone is from a foreign country
sw2525B-ms98-a-0048 265.551125 267.957875 and they come to this country
sw2525B-ms98-a-0049 267.957875 277.256250 and uh commit a crime i think that irregardless of whether they have already become a citizen or anything they should be immediately deported
sw2525B-ms98-a-0050 277.256250 280.230250 especially if they're found guilty of the crime
sw2525B-ms98-a-0051 280.230250 289.449250 you know once they they have been arrested and if they know beyond a shadow of a doubt these people are guilty that's it we don't take care of them we don't support them
sw2525B-ms98-a-0052 289.449250 292.513125 nothing i mean they go right back where they came from
sw2525B-ms98-a-0053 292.513125 295.343500 [silence]
sw2525B-ms98-a-0054 295.343500 297.167375 exactly
sw2525B-ms98-a-0055 297.167375 298.713625 and
sw2525B-ms98-a-0056 298.713625 304.456375 [silence]
sw2525B-ms98-a-0057 304.456375 319.200000 but that's uh they['re]- they're so close i- i don't consider Mexican people in the same category with uh especially like uh people who come from cultures that don't have the same uh kind of moral upbringing that we have
sw2525B-ms98-a-0058 319.200000 323.620875 like you take Asian countries or um the Eastern countries 
sw2525B-ms98-a-0059 323.620875 336.573000 where women are like in the foreground uh in the background and the men are in the foreground and it's like you know um they live back in whe[re]- where we came from two hundred years ago you know we['ve]- we've advanced beyond that
sw2525B-ms98-a-0060 336.573000 343.680000 and i think that their uh mentality as far as the way they treat them and that kind of thing you know what i mean
sw2525B-ms98-a-0061 343.680000 344.806625 it's
sw2525B-ms98-a-0062 344.806625 350.065750 [silence]
sw2525B-ms98-a-0063 350.065750 351.475875 uh-huh
sw2525B-ms98-a-0064 351.475875 364.501125 [silence]
sw2525B-ms98-a-0065 364.501125 365.835000 yeah
sw2525B-ms98-a-0066 365.835000 381.137000 [silence]
sw2525B-ms98-a-0067 381.137000 382.560500 wow
sw2525B-ms98-a-0068 382.560500 396.142375 [silence]
sw2525B-ms98-a-0069 396.142375 397.632125 wow
sw2525B-ms98-a-0070 397.632125 399.592375 [silence]
sw2525B-ms98-a-0071 399.592375 406.940250 you better believe it if you wouldn't even have to leave it i mean it would get snatched [laughter-right] off your arm [laughter]
sw2525B-ms98-a-0072 406.940250 413.407500 [silence]
sw2525B-ms98-a-0073 413.407500 415.181250 oh sure
sw2525B-ms98-a-0074 415.181250 417.139625 [silence]
sw2525B-ms98-a-0075 417.139625 422.267375 that's amazing well wh[at's]- what's the difference there do you know
sw2525B-ms98-a-0076 422.267375 427.156000 [silence]
sw2525B-ms98-a-0077 427.156000 431.247500 oh i- i believe in the death penalty i really do
sw2525B-ms98-a-0078 431.247500 438.009000 [silence]
sw2525B-ms98-a-0079 438.009000 447.108375 yeah yeah i think that we're too easy uh and we take the the uh uh the civil liberties uh stuff too far 
sw2525B-ms98-a-0080 447.108375 456.769500 you know like people that are in prison i mean we didn't put them there they put themselves in that situation and as far as like them uh entertaining the rights that they should have
sw2525B-ms98-a-0081 456.769500 462.891250 i mean we educate them we feed them we take care of them and they no sooner get out on the street and they're back in again
sw2525B-ms98-a-0082 462.891250 473.529500 i'm not saying they're all bad but i think people who are guilty of really serious heinous crimes do not deserve to be cared for for the rest of their lives
sw2525B-ms98-a-0083 473.529500 475.646750 i think that they should be put away
sw2525B-ms98-a-0084 475.646750 477.867750 [silence]
sw2525B-ms98-a-0085 477.867750 479.828125 get rid of them_1
sw2525B-ms98-a-0086 479.828125 486.839750 exactly i- i really i- i think that that's the whole key here this plea bargaining baloney
sw2525B-ms98-a-0087 486.839750 496.020500 where uh you know they plead to a lesser crime or uh they plead guilty in or you know tell about someone else and they they get less time
sw2525B-ms98-a-0088 496.020500 504.148375 or if they're in there and they've got seventeen years and they're on good behavior they g[et]- for every year they're in they get so many less
sw2525B-ms98-a-0089 504.148375 507.085250 you know that they don't serve the full penalty
sw2525B-ms98-a-0090 507.085250 511.668250 i- i- i really think we're going to far overboard with all of this
sw2525B-ms98-a-0091 511.668250 515.506250 [silence]
sw2525B-ms98-a-0092 515.506250 516.801250 yeah
sw2525B-ms98-a-0093 516.801250 519.006875 same with drunk drivers
sw2525B-ms98-a-0094 519.006875 521.429375 i think it's too easy for them
sw2525B-ms98-a-0095 521.429375 528.097875 that if the the laws and and uh were were harsher and were enforced
sw2525B-ms98-a-0096 528.097875 531.511375 i mean you have to set an example you have to start somewhere
sw2525B-ms98-a-0097 531.511375 539.216375 and i think that people know that they're going to get a slap on the wrist they might serve a little bit of time and that they'll be out on the street again
sw2525B-ms98-a-0098 539.216375 545.990125 an i an[d]- i feel bad for the policeman because he's out there every day facing these people
sw2525B-ms98-a-0099 545.990125 556.513375 this this craziness you know people with uh automatic weapons and uh all this other stuff and trying to do a job and let's face it what do they get paid
sw2525B-ms98-a-0100 556.513375 561.253625 twenty thousand dollars a year if they're lucky i wouldn't do it for that
sw2525B-ms98-a-0101 561.253625 572.962625 [silence]
sw2525B-ms98-a-0102 572.962625 577.994000 it is it really is and i mean they're the first ones that take the brunt of everything
sw2525B-ms98-a-0103 577.994000 587.222875 you know and uh i'm not saying that they're all good either because there's good and bad in everything but they they're already uh have str[ikes]- three strikes against them when they're out there
sw2525B-ms98-a-0104 587.222875 599.877000 because they'll arrest someone and you know go through all that paperwork and writing a report and all this and having all kinds of evidence and you have to even be careful how you arrest them how you talk to them uh you know what they say
