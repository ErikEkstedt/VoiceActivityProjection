sw2520A-ms98-a-0022 97.366000 105.556750 because_1 uh it's it's all size about it's not it's not very big i mean it's like a hundred and five pages something like that
sw2520A-ms98-a-0023 105.556750 113.118750 but it's got lots of good recipes so i was thinking about trying to sell that on the side just [noise] for fun

sw2520A-ms98-a-0028 130.535750 139.456750 well usuall[y]- hardly any at all anymore um i've i've gotten together sort of like basic recipes
sw2520A-ms98-a-0029 139.456750 145.511500 and once you have those you can add to them_1 or take away from them_1 and come up with all kinds of different dishes
sw2520A-ms98-a-0030 145.511500 159.005125 i i have several cookbooks uh Betty Crocker and New York Times and a couple of Japanese cookbooks a couple of Chinese cookbooks i even got a Filipino cookbook um
sw2520A-ms98-a-0031 159.005125 162.869250 they have a nice dish in there for a chicken dish i forgot the name of it
sw2520A-ms98-a-0032 162.869250 167.547000 but it takes a special kind of sausage and you can only get it at Filipino stores
sw2520A-ms98-a-0033 167.547000 172.644750 yeah and i[t's]- it's a it's a strange sort of it's sort of like a pepperoni
sw2520A-ms98-a-0034 172.644750 177.134875 but it's it has a much sharper flavor and it's uh
sw2520A-ms98-a-0035 177.134875 183.598500 it's almost like it has red dye in it or something when you cook it it bleeds and it colors the food
sw2520A-ms98-a-0036 183.598500 191.037750 it's pretty interesting but it's a real good chicken dish it's sort of like a chicken potpie in a way you have a crust on top and all that
sw2520A-ms98-a-0037 191.037750 193.645750 delicious though i love it
