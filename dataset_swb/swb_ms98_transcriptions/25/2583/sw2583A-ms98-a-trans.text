sw2583A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 4.727500 the uh public school sys[tem]- system seems to be
sw2583A-ms98-a-0002 4.727500 16.052750 getting a lot of uh criticism lately i guess over the years it's always seemed worse uh to the parents that have kids in there than it was when they were there so
sw2583A-ms98-a-0003 16.052750 24.728750 uh i don't know how much of it is well a lot of it is deserved but then a lot of it's not i mean th[e]- the kids are coming out learning
sw2583A-ms98-a-0004 24.728750 38.628875 uh things a lot faster uh whether or not they actually have it learned th[at]- that that yet uh remains to be seen at least in our kids case it's they're still in it but uh i know they're learning things that uh
sw2583A-ms98-a-0005 38.628875 42.425625 we never learned plus they have the burden of uh
sw2583A-ms98-a-0006 42.425625 53.917125 well this is the burden they have the task of learning computers uh even in uh kindergarten they had uh a requirements that they had to meet for learning the uh
sw2583A-ms98-a-0007 53.917125 61.239625 terms like keyboard and monitor and they wanted know what a computer was and what a disk was and 
sw2583A-ms98-a-0008 61.239625 72.264250 you know all the uh yeah it is but it's interesting that that there's that much more knowledge to be learned at this at this uh age you know not just the colors and begin on the alphabet it's 
sw2583A-ms98-a-0009 72.264250 79.027750 learn your colors learn your alphabet learn all your your little terms here and and learn how to uh
sw2583A-ms98-a-0010 79.027750 86.272625 begin learning some of the reading and by the second or third grade uh the little school system that we're in
sw2583A-ms98-a-0011 86.272625 91.093750 they have uh really a lot of computers uh it's a very
sw2583A-ms98-a-0012 91.093750 99.323500 wealthy district as as all that fighting's going on over who gets the money and the like but they have
sw2583A-ms98-a-0013 99.323500 108.356750 they have uh twenty seven computers for each of the little labs and each lab serves
sw2583A-ms98-a-0014 108.356750 116.125625 uh two grades so the first and second graders have their own batch of computers that they've cycled the kids through and
sw2583A-ms98-a-0015 116.125625 127.227875 and so there's uh well i guess three or four different labs and they're all very nice uh computers all tied together on the LAN and one server that handles all the
sw2583A-ms98-a-0016 127.227875 136.974250 software so that the teachers don't have to go around to each machine and do their work they can control it from the ma[chine]- the server it's it's a beautiful system but uh
sw2583A-ms98-a-0017 136.974250 145.120625 the only bad thing it seems to do is uh not the computer necessarily but the co[mpany]- the school system seems to put a little bit more
sw2583A-ms98-a-0018 145.120625 151.663000 pressure on the kids than uh than we had of course of course i guess with that learning comes that pressure
sw2583A-ms98-a-0019 151.663000 155.333000 we also managed to land in a school that uh
sw2583A-ms98-a-0020 155.333000 168.674375 they decided to build one big rectangular building and then not have any walls for the classroom and so it gets a little noisy it's a little hard to keep the kids that quiet from one class to the next and they can't really
sw2583A-ms98-a-0021 168.674375 176.048625 be rowdy at any one given time so they they put them outside a lot they try you know to get a lot of good breaks here and there and
sw2583A-ms98-a-0022 176.048625 184.148125 but uh they just took bookcases and things to move around and sort of what you know sort of build a an idea of a wall
sw2583A-ms98-a-0023 184.148125 189.122500 and the kids seem to handle it okay but it's it's got some drawbacks to it
sw2583A-ms98-a-0024 189.122500 199.710375 and uh as if that wasn't bad enough they they also experimented with a particular size school most of the elementary schools were uh seven hundred uh
sw2583A-ms98-a-0025 199.710375 210.911625 kids in in it only goes from kindergarten up to fifth grade for our elementaries and our particular schools run uh thousand fifty right now 
sw2583A-ms98-a-0026 210.911625 221.979625 so they they put a few more warm bodies in there than the teachers really needed to have they still have a twenty three to twenty five or so to one teacher ratio but it's still
sw2583A-ms98-a-0027 221.979625 236.943625 yeah still a lot of people and you just can't get them in and out of the school in a reasonable length of time you know traffic is a bit of a problem [laughter] i mean of all the decisions they could have made on this particular school they uh they located it in a
sw2583A-ms98-a-0028 236.943625 248.526125 up against a creek and there's no street access to it except for one turn around driveway and that feeds onto a street that is right across the street from
sw2583A-ms98-a-0029 248.526125 256.830000 another school [laughter] and they all get out at the same time and it's just uh so we we spend a little time getting i get
sw2583A-ms98-a-0030 256.830000 260.753500 go over there to pick up uh my son about two thirty
sw2583A-ms98-a-0031 260.753500 274.095375 and he gets out at two forty five and that gives me a little bit of time to get parked and then i wait for be[tween]- between kids rather than drive all the way home i wait a little while and and at two thirty i mean at three thirty my daughter gets out
sw2583A-ms98-a-0032 274.095375 283.901625 and we usually let them play if the weather's nice play outside until the traffic dies down and then we go home so i'm there from two thirty until four o'clock i'm just waiting for
sw2583A-ms98-a-0033 283.901625 292.020375 to pick up the kids that's how much of a chunk it takes out of the old day but uh it is better just to let them you know play outside than it is to fight the traffic so
sw2583A-ms98-a-0034 292.020375 298.474375 and there's it's real nice park lands on both sides of the school they have you know climbers and stuff like that but
sw2583A-ms98-a-0035 298.474375 304.022875 the the school system in and of itself as far as what they're teaching um
sw2583A-ms98-a-0036 304.022875 305.180375 [silence]
sw2583A-ms98-a-0037 305.180375 313.258875 they cannot keep up with the private as far as because of the ratio there's just no way plus the private tends to have
sw2583A-ms98-a-0038 313.258875 322.187875 the more disciplined kids you know they're not dealing with the whole gamut of personalities here they're they're private schools do not put up with
sw2583A-ms98-a-0039 322.187875 326.705750 a child that is uh that much of a problem like most schools have to
sw2583A-ms98-a-0040 326.705750 335.533750 so you have that kind of a situation but uh by the same token you have kids coming out of private schools that they've spent very much time with them
sw2583A-ms98-a-0041 335.533750 341.783500 not able to s[ocial]- cope socially with the other types of people in the world [laughter]
sw2583A-ms98-a-0042 341.783500 412.485500 [silence]
sw2583A-ms98-a-0043 412.485500 413.859375 uh-huh
sw2583A-ms98-a-0044 413.859375 452.812250 [silence]
sw2583A-ms98-a-0045 452.812250 454.143125 uh-huh
sw2583A-ms98-a-0046 454.143125 455.229625 [silence]
sw2583A-ms98-a-0047 455.229625 456.489875 [noise]
sw2583A-ms98-a-0048 456.489875 469.930125 [silence]
sw2583A-ms98-a-0049 469.930125 471.522250 uh-huh
sw2583A-ms98-a-0050 471.522250 472.547375 [silence]
sw2583A-ms98-a-0051 472.547375 477.472625 well another thing that we've noticed that's uh changed over the years and
sw2583A-ms98-a-0052 477.472625 484.091375 uh we're not really sure exactly what we're going what we want to do with it publicly but uh
sw2583A-ms98-a-0053 484.091375 487.151750 the teachings
sw2583A-ms98-a-0054 487.151750 498.854875 uh the ideas that are taught uh don't always agree with what we would teach them either from a standpoint of morals or from a standpoint of how to handle a given situation
sw2583A-ms98-a-0055 498.854875 510.123750 and there seems to be a a large degree of violence not necessarily taught but but ingrained in a majority of the kids either from TV or from
sw2583A-ms98-a-0056 510.123750 513.764625 uh quite a few kids like in the
sw2583A-ms98-a-0057 513.764625 523.598875 second to third grade take uh karate lessons and take various uh self-defense things and it's it's it's given to them or it's proposed 
sw2583A-ms98-a-0058 523.598875 531.888000 it seems to be socially acceptable as a self-esteem you know building building the person's confidence up and you have
sw2583A-ms98-a-0059 531.888000 541.803250 uh third and fourth graders that are uh you know when they get into a fight they they tend to use some of the the
sw2583A-ms98-a-0060 541.803250 555.553000 maneuvers that they have and they feel a little more confident about their fighting ability they tend to get into a few more fights and several of them have ended with uh police calls and and having uh broken bones down at that level of
sw2583A-ms98-a-0061 555.553000 562.848750 of kids i know more than one kid that has has got a uh record already just because of fighting of that that nature
sw2583A-ms98-a-0062 562.848750 573.266875 and [noise] it's it's not something that necessarily happens at school but just in their their uh relationships as they after school times and the like
sw2583A-ms98-a-0063 573.266875 585.999625 and then you get into the whole area of of uh well what what i would deem the new age thinking where they have these little extra classes but they offer to come in about fifteen to twenty minutes early in the mornings and
sw2583A-ms98-a-0064 585.999625 599.253250 all the kids will sit around in a little circle and they're they're asked to empty their minds and to to think about uh they have a name of a particular dinosaur that they they're to uh think about that dinosaur and they're encouraged
