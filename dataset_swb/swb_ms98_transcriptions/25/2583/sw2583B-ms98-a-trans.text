sw2583B-ms98-a-0038 340.995125 348.417125 yeah um i remember i mean during my i went to a private school during the ju[nior]- junior high years which was uh
sw2583B-ms98-a-0039 348.417125 358.708625 you know really during the de[velopment]- development time of my life and it was a small school we had like maybe twenty people in junior high
sw2583B-ms98-a-0040 358.708625 371.508625 i mean in my class like in seventh grade we had twenty in them and whenever we moved up to the eigh[th]- eighth grade we had like twenty or twenty five in the whole eighth grade and we had two different classes so the ratio was real good um
sw2583B-ms98-a-0041 371.508625 384.655250 as far as the we had real good teachers and i learned a lot i feel like that if i had of gone to a private school during junior high i probably wouldn't have developed such good study skills because um
sw2583B-ms98-a-0042 384.655250 390.590875 i thought the private school was difficult i mean it gave a lot of homework and everything and it really helped me develop
sw2583B-ms98-a-0043 390.590875 392.915375 my skills my uh
sw2583B-ms98-a-0044 392.915375 407.047375 my memorization i can memorize things real well now and things like that but and then whenever i got to high school it was kind of a disadvantage to me t[o]- to the fact that i was going from a class of twenty to a class of five hundred
sw2583B-ms98-a-0045 407.047375 413.032500 and uh and i do feel like that i was socially withdrawn to a certain extent because i didn't know anyone
sw2583B-ms98-a-0046 413.032500 416.656000 and i was a freshman in high school you know and i was the peon
sw2583B-ms98-a-0047 416.656000 429.954125 but uh it probably took i don't know maybe the first semester to get to get to where i was really comfortable with school because um i hadn't been in the public school system for so long and it is just it's really different 
sw2583B-ms98-a-0048 429.954125 442.963625 it uh the children there are a lot a lot wilder than what i was used to i was gr[ew]- i grew up in a very protective home and then whenever i got to high school things were just
sw2583B-ms98-a-0049 442.963625 456.188250 so much different especially nowadays i mean even the high school that i went to just recently they put up these little metal detectors at each door when you walk in to make sure you don't have a gun and things like that and uh
sw2583B-ms98-a-0050 456.188250 470.897375 i mean it's it's gotten worse i graduated about two years ago and even in the past two years it's gotten i mean it's just increased the the crime and the the drugs and the violence and everything have just cr[ime]- increased enormously
sw2583B-ms98-a-0051 470.897375 472.658250 so um
