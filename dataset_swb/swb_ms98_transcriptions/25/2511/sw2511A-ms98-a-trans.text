sw2511A-ms98-a-0002 0.785500 14.632250 well Wayne i've never done any uh auto repairs myself at all i mean i may have screwed in a little [laughter] screw that looked like it was falling out on the door or something but uh i personally haven't done anything maybe
sw2511A-ms98-a-0003 14.632250 23.803625 i've uh changed wi[per]- wiper blades or something but i have noticed since uh i got married that my husband
sw2511A-ms98-a-0004 23.803625 36.594125 he hates to do auto repairs but he would rather do them himself than than to pay someone else i guess he can't make himself pay someone to do the repairs when he knows he knows how to do it
sw2511A-ms98-a-0005 36.594125 44.497750 and to do it so he he hates the time that he takes but he has changed um
sw2511A-ms98-a-0006 44.497750 54.667000 the brakes and he has done all of the tune-ups and the things like that [noise] and recently he changed the steering mechanism in our car
sw2511A-ms98-a-0007 54.667000 60.818500 i was really impressed with that [laughter] we had to have it to get the car inspected it wouldn't pass inspection and
sw2511A-ms98-a-0008 60.818500 71.261000 and so he priced around and everyone wanted several hundred dollars for it so he thought well i can get one in a junkyard for like fifty dollars which he did and then
sw2511A-ms98-a-0009 71.261000 80.412750 he did it and i so i guess uh he's been pretty good about keeping our cars up what uh what's your experience been like

sw2511A-ms98-a-0031 204.967125 208.650000 yeah well that's exactly the way he feels is that
sw2511A-ms98-a-0032 208.650000 222.727125 he really hates to spend the time it takes a lot of time if he if he thinks it's going to be two hours it's four [vocalized-noise] you know whatever it always takes him twice as long but then when he's finished he's he always says well now you owe me 
sw2511A-ms98-a-0033 222.727125 236.440125 three hundred dollars [laughter] and then he thinks that he has the money that that he can spend on something and he hasn't given it to someone else so he gets some satisfaction out of that although
sw2511A-ms98-a-0034 236.440125 249.409500 generally i think he he does not look forward to or anticipate there's some people that enjoy tinkering around on cars there's a lot of people and he just isn't one of them

sw2511A-ms98-a-0052 332.957750 347.798250 right you know that it's uh really has a bad reputation is to feel that that people in general feel and have have rightly so i think been cheated many times and um
sw2511A-ms98-a-0053 347.798250 359.258500 and well i know once when we had a we usually round inspection time we find out there's something wrong with our car but um once the muffler needed to be changed and uh
sw2511A-ms98-a-0054 359.258500 371.979125 he had looked at it himself and but we saw a commercial for like fourteen or twenty dollars or something for a change he said that's really really good so he went in and uh but when
sw2511A-ms98-a-0055 371.979125 384.454500 they quoted him a price they really wanted fifty or something anyway but the car that the muffler people had um my at least my husband felt that they had damaged the muffler
sw2511A-ms98-a-0056 384.454500 399.098875 further you know they had punctured a big hole in it when it really could have just been patched or whatever and so since then i don't think he's ever even seriously considered a you know any kind of job he thought he could do himself
sw2511A-ms98-a-0057 399.098875 411.632500 but i know from his childhood he says that his father always buys and restores cars just as entertainment i [laughter-guess] and um so Kelly growing up he 
sw2511A-ms98-a-0058 411.632500 417.730500 he felt like that that was a good way on Saturday's that he developed a good relationship with his father
sw2511A-ms98-a-0059 417.730500 425.487875 and so he used they used car repairs kind of as a way to have uh you know something that they did together
sw2511A-ms98-a-0060 425.487875 435.441375 and he thought that turned out pretty good because it you know it helped him to understand and be functional now and it helped him to have a close relationship so
sw2511A-ms98-a-0061 435.441375 439.447625 that's one one way he looked at it
sw2511A-ms98-a-0062 439.447625 454.224750 [silence]

sw2511A-ms98-a-0069 494.769250 502.105000 yeah it didn't always work well i felt um i feel like i could myself do some things
sw2511A-ms98-a-0070 502.105000 510.488875 but that i have enough [laughter-responsibility] that if i have someone like my father when i was living at home and my husband 
sw2511A-ms98-a-0071 510.488875 515.787500 that's willing to do it i go ahead and let them do it i don't feel the need to um
sw2511A-ms98-a-0072 515.787500 529.698500 you know be a feminist on that issue and say i can take care of my own things i'm i'm happy to let them ru[n]- run the cars because i have so many other responsibilities that um 
sw2511A-ms98-a-0073 529.698500 533.695500 so i haven't tried to do a lot myself

sw2511A-ms98-a-0082 570.300500 583.015750 not so scary if um you're driving it and you might get stranded somewhere that you might you think well i've i've been under that hood and i know what's going on but
