sw2511B-ms98-a-0003 6.909750 52.473625 [silence]
sw2511B-ms98-a-0004 52.473625 57.723125 [noise] um-hum [laughter]
sw2511B-ms98-a-0005 57.723125 76.966625 [silence]
sw2511B-ms98-a-0006 76.966625 80.775625 well i uh i
sw2511B-ms98-a-0007 80.775625 89.213875 have a long experience with cars i uh when i was younger uh my brother had a Corvette and i bought a Corvette and 
sw2511B-ms98-a-0008 89.213875 97.292000 when you have a Corvette you more or less do all the work and i've done everything from build the motor from the uh you know the bare block on up
sw2511B-ms98-a-0009 97.292000 104.485875 and i i'm the same way as your husband is when it comes to my car i hate to go pay somebody good money
sw2511B-ms98-a-0010 104.485875 119.460875 you know i hate to pay somebody twenty five dollars an hour for something i can do myself it just to me it makes absolutely no economic sense to do that [noise] in fact i um just this past weekend put new plugs in both uh my car an my wife's car
sw2511B-ms98-a-0011 119.460875 121.529625 and so i uh
sw2511B-ms98-a-0012 121.529625 131.754125 i pretty much try to troubleshoot and do everything i can do myself but i've i've gotten to the point in my life um you know i just crept over forty years old where
sw2511B-ms98-a-0013 131.754125 138.713750 i don't want to crawl underneath the car anymore [laughter] i mean it's uh
sw2511B-ms98-a-0014 138.713750 144.145375 i don't know whether i've i've just reached a point you know it's it's real rough in the winter time
sw2511B-ms98-a-0015 144.145375 146.487875 [vocalized-noise] and uh 
sw2511B-ms98-a-0016 146.487875 158.350875 and so i try to make sure that uh by the time fall runs around because_1 we actually have winters here on the east coast um [laughter] that uh i have you know the car's in pretty good shape enough to last through the winter
sw2511B-ms98-a-0017 158.350875 166.945875 and uh then spring time i usually end up giving them_1 uh a uh a tune-up and make sure that they're running well and uh 
sw2511B-ms98-a-0018 166.945875 175.467625 yeah it's like i had the muffler go out on my on my car shortly before it was required to go in Maryland they have uh emission tests
sw2511B-ms98-a-0019 175.467625 188.993500 and you're required to get your car to go through the emission test well my muffler of course starting going bad right before i was supposed to go to the emission test so you know i had to do that job and of course that was back in December when it's nice and cold outside [laughter]
sw2511B-ms98-a-0020 188.993500 194.782625 but the thing was that i could do the job myself i mean the parts cost me
sw2511B-ms98-a-0021 194.782625 201.463000 oh roughly a hundred dollars um if i'd taken it someplace to have it done it was going to be three hundred twenty five
sw2511B-ms98-a-0022 201.463000 207.451500 now like who's got that extra two and a quarter [laughter] i [laughter-know] i don't so 
sw2511B-ms98-a-0023 207.451500 223.282875 [silence]
sw2511B-ms98-a-0024 223.282875 225.792625 [laughter]
sw2511B-ms98-a-0025 225.792625 232.983000 [silence]
sw2511B-ms98-a-0026 232.983000 234.311375 yeah
sw2511B-ms98-a-0027 234.311375 248.981875 [silence]
sw2511B-ms98-a-0028 248.981875 257.980750 yeah i uh i don't mind it um there was a time when i had my Corvette i mean of course i loved it um
sw2511B-ms98-a-0029 257.980750 264.498750 but i've you know i've got other interests now and there's a lot other more important things i think i should be doing with my time
sw2511B-ms98-a-0030 264.498750 275.823750 and i have the same problem i mean you can tell him from me but it doesn't matter i mean i've i've had greasy fingernails for years [laughter] and it still takes me twice as long as i think it's going to [laughter-take] to do the job 
sw2511B-ms98-a-0031 275.823750 281.705875 so but th[ink]- i think the difference is that uh when you own the car you take more care in what you're doing
sw2511B-ms98-a-0032 281.705875 285.497000 and you want to make sure that it's done right and put back together right and
sw2511B-ms98-a-0033 285.497000 290.997875 you know i've i've in the past i've had brake jobs done by someone that when i went back and
sw2511B-ms98-a-0034 290.997875 295.250500 and looked at it some months later i'd find something drastically wrong with it
sw2511B-ms98-a-0035 295.250500 307.826625 you know like a spring that was put in incorrectly which could have resulted in brakes failing and me having an accident you know those kind of things and when you have a vehicle that's being used by you know other members of your family you know you don't want
sw2511B-ms98-a-0036 307.826625 310.747000 that kind of a situation to come up
sw2511B-ms98-a-0037 310.747000 324.529875 and it's very very difficult to find a mechanic these days that you can trust i only have one guy that i know that i trust to work on my car and uh he's about uh sixty miles from here
sw2511B-ms98-a-0038 324.529875 332.965125 and so it and if i have something that's really major that i can't handle or feel i don't have the time to handle i'll take it to him to do it
sw2511B-ms98-a-0039 332.965125 343.659000 [silence]
sw2511B-ms98-a-0040 343.659000 346.478750 uh-huh yes
sw2511B-ms98-a-0041 346.478750 388.843125 [silence]
sw2511B-ms98-a-0042 388.843125 390.220000 uh-huh
sw2511B-ms98-a-0043 390.220000 405.485375 [silence]
sw2511B-ms98-a-0044 405.485375 406.951125 uh-huh
sw2511B-ms98-a-0045 406.951125 417.295625 [silence]
sw2511B-ms98-a-0046 417.295625 418.711125 uh-huh
sw2511B-ms98-a-0047 418.711125 424.984125 [silence]
sw2511B-ms98-a-0048 424.984125 426.483750 yeah
sw2511B-ms98-a-0049 426.483750 438.401875 [silence]
sw2511B-ms98-a-0050 438.401875 441.494375 yeah that's probably uh
sw2511B-ms98-a-0051 441.494375 443.998250 uh something that uh
sw2511B-ms98-a-0052 443.998250 457.660250 is is you know is good for both of them i know that uh my older son i could never get him interested in cars and i couldn't you know i just like you know you sure you're a boy i mean your not interested in cars [laughter] i mean he he just
sw2511B-ms98-a-0053 457.660250 467.706750 would not have anything to do with them and uh later on and uh like when he you know grew up got out of the house and got his own car um
sw2511B-ms98-a-0054 467.706750 479.989000 he didn't know how to do anything to it i mean absolutely nothing i mean he couldn't even check the oil i mean that's that's how uninformed he was and disinterested
sw2511B-ms98-a-0055 479.989000 491.504500 and i guess there are some people out there like that um you know i always thought maybe you know if he took more of an interest and you know what i was doing and maybe we could have communicated better
sw2511B-ms98-a-0056 491.504500 496.081000 but uh yeah i- i think that's great
sw2511B-ms98-a-0057 496.081000 532.882625 [silence]
sw2511B-ms98-a-0058 532.882625 544.920750 uh i- i trained my uh my wife in the hou[se]- in in doing things in fact uh when i uh first transferred down to uh Texas Instruments back in nineteen eighty seven um
sw2511B-ms98-a-0059 544.920750 552.341375 uh when i left here uh she had to change a set of plugs in the car [laughter] because_1 she was up here for a month or so after i was
sw2511B-ms98-a-0060 552.341375 565.049750 and uh it was an interesting experience for her i mean she'd always assisted me and done some other things but for her to actually get in there and do it herself it was uh it was something di[fferent]- a little different 
sw2511B-ms98-a-0061 565.049750 579.449250 [silence]
sw2511B-ms98-a-0062 579.449250 581.522875 uh yeah
sw2511B-ms98-a-0063 581.522875 593.112875 yeah i think it's important that everyone know you know basically how how the darn engine works it helps you figure out what's wrong with it you know i've i've been out with my sister before when
sw2511B-ms98-a-0064 593.112875 599.544125 you know her car died on the highway and i happened to be with her and managed to get her to the other side of the road because it was dark and all
