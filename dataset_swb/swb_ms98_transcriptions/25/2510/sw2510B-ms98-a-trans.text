sw2510B-ms98-a-0084 434.925875 440.369625 it's like a major production trying to find somebody to take care of the dog while you're gone
sw2510B-ms98-a-0085 440.369625 453.605375 and i we knew it but we never even thought that about when we got the dog we just saw him oh he's so cute let's take him home [laughter] you know and then the first weekend we had him we had we were in a apartment in a two bedroom apartment
sw2510B-ms98-a-0086 453.605375 455.860125 and my husband went out of town
sw2510B-ms98-a-0087 455.860125 462.542250 and left me with with the brand new puppy and i had to work twelve hours that day
sw2510B-ms98-a-0088 462.542250 473.683250 and so i left the dog locked in the bedroom and i put paper all over the floor well when i came home i opened the door and there were chunks of carpet padding
sw2510B-ms98-a-0089 473.683250 478.591000 everything all over the place and he had tried to dig his way out from underneath the door
sw2510B-ms98-a-0090 478.591000 480.783125 [silence]
sw2510B-ms98-a-0091 480.783125 486.699625 well i had the carpet fixed um i yeah i didn't even tell the apartment managers about it

sw2510B-ms98-a-0093 488.838125 496.098875 but that that was my first real experience w[ith]- with with a puppy when when we had our family dog growing up
sw2510B-ms98-a-0094 496.098875 503.687500 i was eleven or twelve i think when we first got him and i wasn't really involved in th[e]- the the
sw2510B-ms98-a-0095 503.687500 514.788000 paper training and you know teaching him commands and stuff so this was and to me a whole new experience [laughter] only it wasn't like cats at all
