sw2514B-ms98-a-0005 12.489125 23.436000 i know our policy i like in Nicaragua i'm familiar with that [noise] because_1 we have um some friends that live on the Nicaraguan border and they're they're missionaries there and they
sw2514B-ms98-a-0006 23.436000 28.426750 they live there and they have to travel by boat forty five minutes to get to their car and stuff
sw2514B-ms98-a-0007 28.426750 32.821375 and uh i know that they helped a lot of those Sandinistas refugees
sw2514B-ms98-a-0008 32.821375 45.993375 coming across the border and they housed them and stuff they've been down there about three years now and they lived it's kind of weird [laughter] [laughter-they] have bats in their roof but the bats eat the bad spiders so they leave the bats you know so uh

sw2514B-ms98-a-0013 63.938250 70.223625 yeah i think their policy with them that though is um i don't know i think
sw2514B-ms98-a-0014 70.223625 77.619750 i wish we would have just i'm not that up on the policy of way i know that's kind of old but i don't know i just i'm glad that
sw2514B-ms98-a-0015 77.619750 89.464375 the Sandinistas aren't in power anymore because i think that they were [noise] very wicked and uh probably some of the biggest drug dealers that the world has probably ever seen and i feel like
sw2514B-ms98-a-0016 89.464375 99.528250 most of the leaders in Latin America are probably you would be safe to say that they were just very very you know big into drugs

sw2514B-ms98-a-0040 174.482500 186.813000 yeah i they need to have more checks and balances in their government to [noise] get rid of the corruption but i think first though i don't know they need to i think turn these people in
sw2514B-ms98-a-0041 186.813000 191.824500 the repentance on the leadership of the different nations for all their uh
sw2514B-ms98-a-0042 191.824500 205.718875 you know the atrocities that they've commit and the drug dealings and in the just in the drug crimes because_1 i feel like a lot of the leadership of those nations are so engrossed in the drug crimes that until they repent or they're moved from power
sw2514B-ms98-a-0043 205.718875 212.230750 that you know but there's so many of them that the next one to come up if you just knock one off you going to have another one
sw2514B-ms98-a-0044 212.230750 220.182250 and i know a lot of those nations there's uh oh Brazil i know is like forty percent evangelical Christian not just go to church but 
sw2514B-ms98-a-0045 220.182250 225.651250 you know really on fire for God and they're just surpassing America Latin America by
sw2514B-ms98-a-0046 225.651250 240.353375 the drugs you know it's just incomprehensible and uh so i just think that i think that God's going to honor that and that he's going to put in some good leadership and i know the president of i believe Costa Rica
sw2514B-ms98-a-0047 240.353375 249.941750 is a Christian and he goes to no Guatemala because_1 he goes to Virgo Church in Guatemala City our church is r[eally]- in real close relationship with him
sw2514B-ms98-a-0048 249.941750 254.927750 and he is a former president of Guatemala he's an elder at Virgo Church and
sw2514B-ms98-a-0049 254.927750 263.845500 you know that that God is doing something he is raising up some leaders and the people want him back as president bad but they have a rule in Guatemala that he can't have another term
sw2514B-ms98-a-0050 263.845500 276.494875 so they're the people are trying to override that i mean not just the Christians but all the people because they see when a righteous man is in authority the people rejoice so yeah [noise]

sw2514B-ms98-a-0063 318.205875 323.228250 i know that Costa Rica they don't allow anybody to come in that um
sw2514B-ms98-a-0064 323.228250 330.997375 to come in any uh what do you call what do you call immigrants they don't allow anything like that like i could not go to Costa Rica and live
sw2514B-ms98-a-0065 330.997375 344.241750 as an American citizen they would not permit me to move there to work they wouldn't their jobs are there for Costa Ricans they don't allow people to move in like less nations you know and take the jobs
sw2514B-ms98-a-0066 344.241750 351.209625 no they don't take any i mean i couldn't even go there my husband couldn't we would have to receive all this special permission to go there
sw2514B-ms98-a-0067 351.209625 353.665250 for even when some you know in in inner
sw2514B-ms98-a-0068 353.665250 356.179375 company you know transfer or something
sw2514B-ms98-a-0069 356.179375 364.764875 and i have another friend from uh Costa Rica that she was born there she's Costa Rican i guess i do know a little bit i went to Mexico City one time
sw2514B-ms98-a-0070 364.764875 376.674125 and stayed i've been there twice and stayed and that wa[s]- that was just really sad but a lot of it though is their debt i think that we should not loan them anymore money that if we still want to give them money give them money
sw2514B-ms98-a-0071 376.674125 390.997125 quit loaning it to them_1 you're not going to get it back don't be indebted to anybody don't be the you know loaner nor borrower and it's just not good we need to if we feel like we need to give them_1 money then give it to them but quit loaning all the money out which i don't think we're loaning anymore now but
sw2514B-ms98-a-0072 390.997125 403.375500 that's how we got into a problem if we got them we have sink them in the hole by us loaning them all of these billions of dollars that common sense you could just look at it and say they're not going to be able to pay us back
sw2514B-ms98-a-0073 403.375500 410.395625 [silence]
sw2514B-ms98-a-0074 410.395625 413.705500 um-hum right

sw2514B-ms98-a-0076 415.467250 418.669750 Lo Mas yeah
sw2514B-ms98-a-0077 418.669750 424.804000 yeah but we we are now it's like we are partly responsible for their problems by loaning them all that money 
sw2514B-ms98-a-0078 424.804000 434.180500 that was really stupid on our part to even loan it to them_1 you don't loan money to people like that i mean if you feel like you need to give them_1 something to help them out fine but you don't go making
sw2514B-ms98-a-0079 434.180500 443.419625 billions of dollars of loans in to people that you can just look at the situation and yeah and know that they are not going to be capable of paying us back and
sw2514B-ms98-a-0080 443.419625 454.243875 that puts a bondage on them it makes you know pressure on the nation and on the people on the leadership and makes their inflation go up and it's just a big mess so
sw2514B-ms98-a-0081 454.243875 457.817000 [silence]
sw2514B-ms98-a-0082 457.817000 469.660750 no but i knew people i was there before that but i knew people i got a letter from a friend of mine that i had met there that who who the apartment building was destroyed and they were living in a tent so it's kind of weird you know
sw2514B-ms98-a-0083 469.660750 480.719125 because_1 these were people he was on the US dive the Mexican diving Olympic pool he'd go watch them_1 dive and all this so they were you know just normal people weren't squatters or poor people or anything that
sw2514B-ms98-a-0084 480.719125 485.886750 um i did i knew all of my friends there but none of them that i know of got killed in it
sw2514B-ms98-a-0085 485.886750 499.817375 but um they're all Christians though [laughter] God really protected them see that broke out a revival in Mexico City that CBS news and ABC never told you about there's been a real revival in Mexico City since that earthquake because_1 there's a lot of
sw2514B-ms98-a-0086 499.817375 508.763625 man there's a lot of sin in those nations and a lot lots of witchcraft a lot of witchcraft a whole lot of witchcraft
sw2514B-ms98-a-0087 508.763625 511.989250 so a lot of it in the name of Christianity
sw2514B-ms98-a-0088 511.989250 519.842875 so you know oh yeah there's a lot you know they call themselves Christians but you know they are over there doing witchcraft and stuff and
sw2514B-ms98-a-0089 519.842875 528.826500 just a whole the lot of it's a generational things too like the Mayans and the Incas you can't find a trace of them_1 because_1 God totally destroyed them for how wicked they were
sw2514B-ms98-a-0090 528.826500 540.231000 and yet they're revered and honored and almost worshipped by so many people even now in America you know everyone's all intrigued with all of these Indian groups that were totally removed from the face of the earth
sw2514B-ms98-a-0091 540.231000 554.996375 because of how wicked they were i've been down to the pyramids and i've climbed to the top of the pyramid of the sun where they used to take a beating heart out of a young thirteen year old boy and hold it up to the sun God and that's pretty heavy duty you know [noise]
sw2514B-ms98-a-0092 554.996375 557.495500 [silence]
sw2514B-ms98-a-0093 557.495500 570.499125 i don't think there are the little box is black on the top of the pyramid of the sun it's black so yeah you can't really tell but it is kind of weird you know you think wow there is where they did human sacrifices to false Gods and
sw2514B-ms98-a-0094 570.499125 572.804375 [silence]
sw2514B-ms98-a-0095 572.804375 584.995250 um at that time i kind of did it was a very oppressed eerie just you know feeling but i wasn't a Christian when i went there but uh i think that all those
sw2514B-ms98-a-0096 584.995250 599.105625 those you know generational things i think that God did i'm praying you know over the peop[le]- the Christians now are beginning to rise up there to be able to pray and because_1 that does affect things you know those the when your background
