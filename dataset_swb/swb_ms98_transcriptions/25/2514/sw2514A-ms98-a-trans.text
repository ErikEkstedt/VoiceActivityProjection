sw2514A-ms98-a-0004 44.584125 51.488500 yeah it's a whole whole different culture um [vocalized-noise] it [vocalized-noise] it's weird down there because
sw2514A-ms98-a-0005 51.488500 64.950750 there's all lizards and things running around that people who live there they just they take it for granted and it's like we go down there on vacation it's like oh how can these people live with these lizards and like bats in their house

sw2514A-ms98-a-0008 102.995000 111.465000 the thing about it is like the Panamanians is a lot of servicemen down there a lot of a lot even our American servicemen are involved
sw2514A-ms98-a-0009 111.465000 121.973500 because_1 i guess there was a big big uh scam they they set all these guys up and like a dozen servicemen got caught for running a drug ring
sw2514A-ms98-a-0010 121.973500 131.533000 so it's it's like everybody is into it it's just greed [vocalized-noise] human greed [vocalized-noise] interestingly about_1 about_1 that country is in Honduras

sw2514A-ms98-a-0014 152.499125 157.989125 uh and you can't the American government you can't trust them either because_1 you think
sw2514A-ms98-a-0015 157.989125 171.480625 you don't know how corrupt they are i mean they keep people in power like the Shah of Iran and things like that i mean it's the lesser of two evils they'll probably you know say this is the lesser of two evils
sw2514A-ms98-a-0016 171.480625 176.999875 but i don't know how corrupt the Honduran government is but the

sw2514A-ms98-a-0018 271.401625 280.490750 yeah good see that's the thing that is going to have to that's the undoing of everything is that we have no morals i mean
sw2514A-ms98-a-0019 280.490750 292.470750 talk about the crime and all that in the city it's just the kids have no morals and stuff that's the thing that will eventually you know if anyone is going to be saved it is having a good moral background
sw2514A-ms98-a-0020 292.470750 300.769625 um but it's funny you will mention Costa Rica because i guess they're one of the most successful and peaceful countries in Central America
sw2514A-ms98-a-0021 300.769625 313.709625 so i was reading an article in uh National Geographic and i don't know i don't think they have any more money than any of the other countries they don't have oil or anything and they don't have big tourism
sw2514A-ms98-a-0022 313.709625 319.448375 so maybe it is their faith that has enabled them to keep the crime out
