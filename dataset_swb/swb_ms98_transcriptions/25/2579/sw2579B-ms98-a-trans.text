sw2579B-ms98-a-0033 126.140000 136.822500 we had about three or four days of that and then all of a sudden a cold front came down and uh temperatures dropped thirty degrees in a very short length of time
sw2579B-ms98-a-0034 136.822500 151.466625 and uh it has gone down gradually each day this morning it was twenty nine yesterday it was about thirty two uh cars were scraping ice off their cars this morning if they've been sitting out all night

sw2579B-ms98-a-0038 165.026750 173.567625 well they are predicting rain and thunderstorms and i wouldn't be a bit surprised by what we would not be getting the same weather you had
sw2579B-ms98-a-0039 173.567625 177.651375 [silence]
sw2579B-ms98-a-0040 177.651375 185.888625 uh yeah [laughter] yes warm rain well of course by the time it gets up here it may ru[n]- run into a cold front coming down from Canada
sw2579B-ms98-a-0041 185.888625 189.509250 [silence]

sw2579B-ms98-a-0045 194.073000 202.074375 we had uh a week ago they had golf ball size hail coming down in one part of the uh of the city of Dayton itself
sw2579B-ms98-a-0046 202.074375 210.695375 and uh then we just had about an inch and a half or two inches of rain in less than an hour
sw2579B-ms98-a-0047 210.695375 216.276750 it was just coming down by the bucketfulls and a great deal of lightning
sw2579B-ms98-a-0048 216.276750 225.631750 it it wasn't uh it wasn't conditions to being out in it and i had just gotten home we had a lot of tornado warnings also
sw2579B-ms98-a-0049 225.631750 236.691875 and i had gotten home shortly before that uh the rain started so uh i felt a little more secure that i was at home rather than having to be out driving in it
sw2579B-ms98-a-0050 236.691875 244.640375 [silence]
sw2579B-ms98-a-0051 244.640375 246.597625 is that right

sw2579B-ms98-a-0058 264.846500 266.895000 very very fortunate for them
sw2579B-ms98-a-0059 266.895000 269.928875 because that could have really been disastrous
sw2579B-ms98-a-0060 269.928875 270.968750 [silence]
sw2579B-ms98-a-0061 270.968750 283.456500 well of course this is tornado season uh in to uh we have many tornadoes spawned in this area and northern Indiana now we're in the southwestern part of uh Ohio
sw2579B-ms98-a-0062 283.456500 298.409875 just forty miles north due north of Cincinnati and uh but uh northern Indiana has many tornadoes come roaring across and we get the backlash off of it if not the part of the tornado itself
sw2579B-ms98-a-0063 298.409875 304.029375 so uh we you know we get a lot of bad weather in this area
sw2579B-ms98-a-0064 304.029375 310.850875 but of course you're supposed to be the sun belt and i do know that you get some freezing weather down there on occasion
sw2579B-ms98-a-0065 310.850875 325.261500 [silence]

sw2579B-ms98-a-0069 330.881625 335.778625 right yes i was going to say that it does make a difference when you're not accustomed
sw2579B-ms98-a-0070 335.778625 337.901250 to uh having to drive in it
sw2579B-ms98-a-0071 337.901250 340.009875 [silence]
sw2579B-ms98-a-0072 340.009875 341.989250 right right

sw2579B-ms98-a-0079 358.648250 367.024000 right well uh well here what they do and i i contend that it's certainly not the right thing to do they spread salt
sw2579B-ms98-a-0080 367.024000 375.506000 and of course the salt does melt the ice but then what melts immediately freezes and becomes uh a perpetual problem
sw2579B-ms98-a-0081 375.506000 378.388375 [silence]
sw2579B-ms98-a-0082 378.388375 381.451250 oh it sure does do that
sw2579B-ms98-a-0083 381.451250 385.314000 [silence]
sw2579B-ms98-a-0084 385.314000 396.334875 well sand and uh but i have learned to do is uh now that i am alone is uh to carry bags of salt in the trunk of my car um
sw2579B-ms98-a-0085 396.334875 406.836375 not only in case i need it for that for traction but for additional weight in the back of the car and then of course kitty litter is also excellent for that
sw2579B-ms98-a-0086 406.836375 410.735500 i don't know whether you've ever thought in terms of that but
sw2579B-ms98-a-0087 410.735500 411.991250 yeah
sw2579B-ms98-a-0088 411.991250 414.274750 [laughter]
sw2579B-ms98-a-0089 414.274750 423.365750 well the dogs don't use litter but kitty litter is excellent for uh getting under the wheels of cars and what have you and giving you traction uh-huh
sw2579B-ms98-a-0090 423.365750 437.595250 yeah it uh works out uh really quite well course i have i have a dog also my son brought me a little Lhasa Apso uh for my birthday last Thanksgiving he brought him from Dallas he
sw2579B-ms98-a-0091 437.595250 443.948250 yes that uh he just thought i had been without a dog uh for three years that was long enough
sw2579B-ms98-a-0092 443.948250 445.492000 he he had
sw2579B-ms98-a-0093 445.492000 447.010375 [silence]
sw2579B-ms98-a-0094 447.010375 449.285000 oh a what

sw2579B-ms98-a-0096 452.436000 453.594625 [silence]
sw2579B-ms98-a-0097 453.594625 460.038625 uh okay okay that makes sense then [laughter] i believe

sw2579B-ms98-a-0103 478.781250 488.213875 and uh i had to put him down when he was fourteen and two months later i had to put my yellow Lab down because he had leukemia
sw2579B-ms98-a-0104 488.213875 497.167625 and uh [noise] then uh then there was no point in having all my acreage i had four and a half acres with game preserve on three sides
sw2579B-ms98-a-0105 497.167625 508.397000 oh well it was great i loved it but then i didn't need all that anymore so i finally sold that and i'm in a fair size condo and i have a nice size patio
sw2579B-ms98-a-0106 508.397000 512.631750 and uh so this little dog has plenty of room to run
sw2579B-ms98-a-0107 512.631750 522.683625 yeah and he is a a cutie and uh but i've never had a dog i had to keep taking to the groomer's to have groomed either and it's
