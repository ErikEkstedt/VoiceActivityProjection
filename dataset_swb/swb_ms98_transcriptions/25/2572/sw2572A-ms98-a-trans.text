sw2572A-ms98-a-0019 61.008000 63.628500 [silence]
sw2572A-ms98-a-0020 63.628500 73.789250 uh doesn't seem to be um granted i i i read primarily the more controversial topics so i'm sure that it's easier for them to uh
sw2572A-ms98-a-0021 73.789250 77.475625 be you know polarized more so on the top[ic]- on the
sw2572A-ms98-a-0022 77.475625 80.432125 the news items that interest me most
sw2572A-ms98-a-0023 80.432125 84.348125 but uh it doesn't seem like there's much middle ground

sw2572A-ms98-a-0031 117.147250 128.874000 [laughter] well i think that it's been proven since somewhere in the early nineteen hundreds that rehabilitation in the forms that we have been attempting it is not realistic
sw2572A-ms98-a-0032 128.874000 130.028750 [silence]
sw2572A-ms98-a-0033 130.028750 137.722375 um i can't remember the study but it was there was a quite a long-term study done in Europe that uh
sw2572A-ms98-a-0034 137.722375 147.138750 evaluated the incarceration systems that America has based their systems on and uh it's been proven
sw2572A-ms98-a-0035 147.138750 151.471000 useless for rehabilitation uh which is
sw2572A-ms98-a-0036 151.471000 156.680500 what a lot of people tend to believe happens in a prison
sw2572A-ms98-a-0037 156.680500 158.440250 and
sw2572A-ms98-a-0038 158.440250 170.462375 um there are amount of reforms that could be helpful in that area are numerous and costly and would [vocalized-noise] re[quire]- require a lot of task forces and et cetera and um
sw2572A-ms98-a-0039 170.462375 173.546125 there is a lot of people in our [laughter-country] that would
sw2572A-ms98-a-0040 173.546125 180.482875 go right off the roof [laughter] um are do you work with the inmates themselves

sw2572A-ms98-a-0059 270.968875 279.752625 i lived in a part of Houston that was uh unpleasant i lived s[outh]- down in uh the Montrose area 
sw2572A-ms98-a-0060 279.752625 280.778750 [silence]
sw2572A-ms98-a-0061 280.778750 290.960750 yeah and it was it i was um keenly aware of the the the danger in my area
sw2572A-ms98-a-0062 290.960750 300.556500 um my roommate was attacked and she got away unharmed but scared to pieces and had had all of her clothing ripped off of her um 
sw2572A-ms98-a-0063 300.556500 301.565375 [silence]
sw2572A-ms98-a-0064 301.565375 306.030125 and then i had another friend that was also approached and got away
sw2572A-ms98-a-0065 306.030125 314.467750 and this was in broad daylight both times so i was keenly aware of the danger in those areas but i didn't
sw2572A-ms98-a-0066 314.467750 317.567500 i guess i didn't feel like i was
sw2572A-ms98-a-0067 317.567500 321.375125 competent enough with any kind of weapon
sw2572A-ms98-a-0068 321.375125 324.902250 to to carry one or to feel
sw2572A-ms98-a-0069 324.902250 339.150750 like carrying one would be a benefit to me rather than just having them take it [laughter] you know i mean that's i that's that's truly how i felt i felt like if i were carrying something and if i actually pulled it on somebody that was trying to attack me
sw2572A-ms98-a-0070 339.150750 344.190750 that their chances of getting it from me would be higher than my chances of using it effectively on them
sw2572A-ms98-a-0071 344.190750 356.435750 [silence]
sw2572A-ms98-a-0072 356.435750 357.675125 uh-huh

sw2572A-ms98-a-0085 420.497125 430.743125 oh i feel that is certainly if you're going to carry one you need to be uh very comfortable with the piece and have
sw2572A-ms98-a-0086 430.743125 443.090500 enough uh knowledge and insight for your own self on whether or not you're going to use it in that situation and not pull it unless you intend to because i i feel like that's
sw2572A-ms98-a-0087 443.090500 455.203500 you know i mean i'm i'm i'm all for uh people having having firearms or having whatever form of protection they prefer because you know even though the odds is
sw2572A-ms98-a-0088 455.203500 467.287500 you know the criminal ends up getting the gun and shooting the people to begin with you know the people that had it in the beginning but if the if if you're talking about uh two people if you're talking about a criminal
sw2572A-ms98-a-0089 467.287500 474.667125 an assailant that is coming at you with a gun and you don't have a gun at all well the chances are a hundred percent they're going to get you
sw2572A-ms98-a-0090 474.667125 480.586375 if you if you both of you have a firearm you've at least got that fifty percent chance
sw2572A-ms98-a-0091 480.586375 482.767625 that you may get them first
sw2572A-ms98-a-0092 482.767625 486.082875 and so i believe in that but
sw2572A-ms98-a-0093 486.082875 499.659125 i i've not ever felt comfortable in it i guess it's [laughter] i'm glad i [laughter] i'm glad i um i'm that i'm married to someone who feels comfortable with them [noise] you know it's it's one of those things um i was reared in Texas so

sw2572A-ms98-a-0111 581.475500 585.235750 i agree that would be something that would have to be
sw2572A-ms98-a-0112 585.235750 588.930250 uh evaluated
sw2572A-ms98-a-0113 588.930250 592.871875 i feel prior to ownership
sw2572A-ms98-a-0114 592.871875 600.894000 the uh i think a lot of people hear only the sensation stories of this child being killed or
