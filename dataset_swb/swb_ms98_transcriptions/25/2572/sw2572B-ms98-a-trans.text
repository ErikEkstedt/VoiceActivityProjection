sw2572B-ms98-a-0003 7.010375 13.022375 uh generally the most of my information i'll get in the morning with my newspaper
sw2572B-ms98-a-0004 13.022375 17.454250 periodically updated through the day i try to catch the news at least
sw2572B-ms98-a-0005 17.454250 25.466500 once before i go to work either on TV or on the radio most days it's just catching it on the radio dr[ive]- on the drive in to work
sw2572B-ms98-a-0006 25.466500 29.777625 [silence]

sw2572B-ms98-a-0009 35.762250 38.471125 but for local local coverage

sw2572B-ms98-a-0011 41.679750 43.815500 a lot more indepth
sw2572B-ms98-a-0012 43.815500 52.920625 [silence]
sw2572B-ms98-a-0013 52.920625 54.935750 i extremely so
sw2572B-ms98-a-0014 54.935750 60.992250 [silence]
sw2572B-ms98-a-0015 60.992250 63.849500 and there's no mid ground anywhere in it
sw2572B-ms98-a-0016 63.849500 84.630000 [silence]
sw2572B-ms98-a-0017 84.630000 90.105750 with what i'm involved with doing is kind of a controversial job anyway
sw2572B-ms98-a-0018 90.105750 100.672000 i work with the uh state prison system so i'm always kind of interested i look at the what the liberal view is on the inmates need more rights and i hear the more conservative lines that we need to get back to
sw2572B-ms98-a-0019 100.672000 101.841750 [silence]
sw2572B-ms98-a-0020 101.841750 105.795750 making the punishment fit the crime but they never do go far enough
sw2572B-ms98-a-0021 105.795750 111.813625 after four years with the system i've got an extreme almost an extremist view on
sw2572B-ms98-a-0022 111.813625 114.726000 get into the criminal justice system
sw2572B-ms98-a-0023 114.726000 115.994250 [silence]
sw2572B-ms98-a-0024 115.994250 118.320125 because what they got now sure isn't working
sw2572B-ms98-a-0025 118.320125 180.077250 [silence]
sw2572B-ms98-a-0026 180.077250 182.241625 yes that's i'm a
sw2572B-ms98-a-0027 182.241625 188.148125 inside guard i also work in the segregation department for the ones that mess up
sw2572B-ms98-a-0028 188.148125 190.419500 so i get the real sweethearts
sw2572B-ms98-a-0029 190.419500 191.463500 [silence]
sw2572B-ms98-a-0030 191.463500 194.842500 but i get a asi[de]- aside from that i 
sw2572B-ms98-a-0031 194.842500 203.461375 i'd almost say i've got extremist views on gun controls on personal crime convention uh personal crime prevention
sw2572B-ms98-a-0032 203.461375 204.971750 [silence]
sw2572B-ms98-a-0033 204.971750 211.565250 there was a thing recently in the paper there was a bill in front of the state legislature that was going to allow
sw2572B-ms98-a-0034 211.565250 215.027500 the average citizen to be able to pack his own weapon again
sw2572B-ms98-a-0035 215.027500 218.343625 concealed or unconcealed i'm all for that
sw2572B-ms98-a-0036 218.343625 226.103625 [silence]
sw2572B-ms98-a-0037 226.103625 229.206875 i don't know if every citizen does or not but just
sw2572B-ms98-a-0038 229.206875 232.858750 you having lived in Houston you know what it's like out there
sw2572B-ms98-a-0039 232.858750 235.235125 when i go to a shopping mall if i
sw2572B-ms98-a-0040 235.235125 238.451500 i feel under dressed if i'm carrying less than two blades
sw2572B-ms98-a-0041 238.451500 239.871500 [silence]
sw2572B-ms98-a-0042 239.871500 247.862000 from the training i had in the military i'd rather take somebody with a blade at close range than i would with a pistol because i know they're going to go down i know i can keep them down 
sw2572B-ms98-a-0043 247.862000 248.981000 [silence]
sw2572B-ms98-a-0044 248.981000 256.813625 but if the if the option came up to where i could pack a side arm in the open i i don't worry about carrying it concealed i want them to know i'm packing it 
sw2572B-ms98-a-0045 256.813625 258.285875 [silence]
sw2572B-ms98-a-0046 258.285875 261.527875 and given the option of that i would definitely
sw2572B-ms98-a-0047 261.527875 266.721250 when i went shopping to the malls i would definitely be packing all kind of pow[er]- firepower
sw2572B-ms98-a-0048 266.721250 279.070750 [silence]
sw2572B-ms98-a-0049 279.070750 281.644625 Wisdom City okay
sw2572B-ms98-a-0050 281.644625 344.094125 [silence]
sw2572B-ms98-a-0051 344.094125 351.633000 that's where the only stipulation i'd like to see tacked on to the legislation saying that there had to be some form of formal
sw2572B-ms98-a-0052 351.633000 352.709625 [silence]
sw2572B-ms98-a-0053 352.709625 357.210000 firearms instruction N R say NRA certified firearms instruction
sw2572B-ms98-a-0054 357.210000 361.911000 you can't train somebody how to shoot in a combat situation until they've been there
sw2572B-ms98-a-0055 361.911000 363.010500 [silence]
sw2572B-ms98-a-0056 363.010500 366.939000 i've seen it in Lebanon i was in in the Granada invasion in eighty three
sw2572B-ms98-a-0057 366.939000 375.521750 i was an advisor down in Central America in eighty four i'm very accustomed to knowing when i pull a piece out whether it's a full sized firearm or a handgun 
sw2572B-ms98-a-0058 375.521750 386.608625 when it clears leather sh[ot]- the shot's going to be fired you don't pull it out for show you pull it out to take care of business the same way with the blade it it comes out of my back pocket or it comes out of a 
sw2572B-ms98-a-0059 386.608625 391.332500 sheath on my web gear it's coming out and it's going to draw blood you don't pull it 
sw2572B-ms98-a-0060 391.332500 393.525250 trying to think is it uh 
sw2572B-ms98-a-0061 393.525250 394.678375 [silence]
sw2572B-ms98-a-0062 394.678375 400.781500 in the Gurkha forces out of India had a legend that went along with their legendary side arm the
sw2572B-ms98-a-0063 400.781500 403.230000 Khukri which is their blade
sw2572B-ms98-a-0064 403.230000 406.609500 you never drew that thing out unless it was going to draw blood
sw2572B-ms98-a-0065 406.609500 408.631125 which is a good
sw2572B-ms98-a-0066 408.631125 410.630500 [silence]
sw2572B-ms98-a-0067 410.630500 413.225125 mental training aspect for it
sw2572B-ms98-a-0068 413.225125 414.616625 [silence]
sw2572B-ms98-a-0069 414.616625 419.047875 th[at]- that or any side arm whether it be a blade or whether it be a handgun or whatever
sw2572B-ms98-a-0070 419.047875 499.282875 [silence]
sw2572B-ms98-a-0071 499.282875 503.959375 there's also a moral aspect to it a lot of people have not
sw2572B-ms98-a-0072 503.959375 512.662875 either mentally sat down and gone over the moral aspect can i take human life even in a life threatening situation to myself or to a loved one
sw2572B-ms98-a-0073 512.662875 513.771500 [silence]
sw2572B-ms98-a-0074 513.771500 516.892875 and when it actually comes down they don't have time to think about it
sw2572B-ms98-a-0075 516.892875 521.211250 in that fraction of a succeed that they're caught i don't know if i can do this
sw2572B-ms98-a-0076 521.211250 527.457625 there's a bullet already on the way to them or there's a blade already cutting them somewhere because they
sw2572B-ms98-a-0077 527.457625 530.313500 they had the time to react but they
sw2572B-ms98-a-0078 530.313500 531.965625 hesitated 
sw2572B-ms98-a-0079 531.965625 533.478625 [silence]
sw2572B-ms98-a-0080 533.478625 535.204375 and that's 
sw2572B-ms98-a-0081 535.204375 537.244000 impossible to 
sw2572B-ms98-a-0082 537.244000 539.032375 [silence]
sw2572B-ms98-a-0083 539.032375 542.292000 in a classroom setting explain that to somebody they've got to
sw2572B-ms98-a-0084 542.292000 543.677625 [silence]
sw2572B-ms98-a-0085 543.677625 547.538750 on their own have made that decision long before they ever decided
sw2572B-ms98-a-0086 547.538750 550.991750 to carry a weapon of any type whether it be a fighting staff
sw2572B-ms98-a-0087 550.991750 553.619625 up to a forty four magnum any any of them
sw2572B-ms98-a-0088 553.619625 557.053625 in the correct hands they're an absolutely fantastic weapon
sw2572B-ms98-a-0089 557.053625 559.671875 [silence]
sw2572B-ms98-a-0090 559.671875 571.169500 but if you haven't made that moral decision can i take a human life even under those situations where either my life or a life of a friend or a life of a family member is threatened 
sw2572B-ms98-a-0091 571.169500 576.210000 can you do you defeated the purpose of even having the gun 
sw2572B-ms98-a-0092 576.210000 578.997000 or the or whatever the weapon is
sw2572B-ms98-a-0093 578.997000 600.894000 [silence]
