sw2536A-ms98-a-0151 512.492250 523.024625 um that's that's when it becomes handy because if i know that you know if the if the uh if the pound is high i can buy more dollar things
sw2536A-ms98-a-0152 523.024625 529.526500 for what i'm getting and then if if i think the rate's going to drop then i pay them back in less dollars
sw2536A-ms98-a-0153 529.526500 535.829875 and it it's worked out most of the times i'm i'm usually pretty good on calling the the currency market

sw2536A-ms98-a-0158 541.699500 544.543625 [noise] when i lived over there i did it quite often
sw2536A-ms98-a-0159 544.543625 554.780500 um and i rea[lly]- i really had a racket going because uh my paycheck was being uh electronically deposited here in the states
sw2536A-ms98-a-0160 554.780500 563.747375 and the bank that i banked with i could write them_1 a check on an American bank and they would give me instant credit for it
sw2536A-ms98-a-0161 563.747375 565.362375 so
