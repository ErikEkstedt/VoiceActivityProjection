sw2537B-ms98-a-0002 5.403125 12.618750 um personally i don't have a problem with it uh i think uh
sw2537B-ms98-a-0003 12.618750 18.579625 as far as uh protecting fellow employees protecting their reputation of the company
sw2537B-ms98-a-0004 18.579625 31.641875 and the quality of work that the people do um it's justified on the other hand um i do agree that it's it's a it's an invasion of privacy as far as a person's
sw2537B-ms98-a-0005 31.641875 46.309500 involvement outside of work um i would never i would never have a problem with anyone testing me but i can understand why people would object so i guess uh i guess uh i'm kind of mixed on it still at this point
sw2537B-ms98-a-0006 46.309500 52.795875 [silence]
sw2537B-ms98-a-0007 52.795875 54.260500 um-hum
sw2537B-ms98-a-0008 54.260500 59.684375 [silence]
sw2537B-ms98-a-0009 59.684375 61.274750 that's right
sw2537B-ms98-a-0010 61.274750 67.944750 [silence]
sw2537B-ms98-a-0011 67.944750 81.870375 that's absolutely right it it uh i guess it all comes down to uh you know a a definition of uh how much out outside activities affect your work and uh
sw2537B-ms98-a-0012 81.870375 94.705250 uh granted you know any any kind of drug use on on company property and whatnot is is definitely not acceptable uh uh i don't think anybody would ever argue that or uh
sw2537B-ms98-a-0013 94.705250 100.789625 any any after affects carrying over into the workday but um
sw2537B-ms98-a-0014 100.789625 111.410625 you know i- i don't i'm not particularly concerned with what people do um after they leave for the day especially if i don't if i don't uh see any results of it the next day
sw2537B-ms98-a-0015 111.410625 116.570125 [silence]
sw2537B-ms98-a-0016 116.570125 124.976250 well i[t]- it is i[t]- you know on the other hand you you've got uh you've got the uh the possibility of people 
sw2537B-ms98-a-0017 124.976250 134.732375 oh you've got some people could be arrested for uh drug use drug dealings and things like that and uh if their if their employers
sw2537B-ms98-a-0018 134.732375 144.773750 name hits the papers and that it's it's it's a mark against them the company and uh you know what kind of people work there what uh 
sw2537B-ms98-a-0019 144.773750 153.028750 [silence]
sw2537B-ms98-a-0020 153.028750 155.240750 that's right that's right
sw2537B-ms98-a-0021 155.240750 159.353125 right e[ven]- even if it is you know a company policy of uh
sw2537B-ms98-a-0022 159.353125 163.243500 immediate termination or whatever they still have to replace them
sw2537B-ms98-a-0023 163.243500 166.908375 and uh there's there's a lot involved there
sw2537B-ms98-a-0024 166.908375 184.037750 [silence]
sw2537B-ms98-a-0025 184.037750 188.625625 i think i think the regular schedule stuff
sw2537B-ms98-a-0026 188.625625 195.774375 um that when you say everybody get out of it that's a good point i never really thought of it that way
sw2537B-ms98-a-0027 195.774375 207.139000 yeah they really can um i think the big the biggest problem i've got is is forcing it on someone after they've already
sw2537B-ms98-a-0028 207.139000 219.326250 agreed to the terms of employment um as far as the new hires i- i hired on just early enough that i- i missed it um where the new hires were concerned but uh
sw2537B-ms98-a-0029 219.326250 233.923875 not nobody no i don't think anybody questions that um testing someone as a as a as a pre condition to being hired but um for the conditions of employment to change while you're on the job that's
sw2537B-ms98-a-0030 233.923875 245.634125 i- i don't know that that's where i think that most people get upset it's uh yeah it it's changing the rules in the middle of the game basically and uh
sw2537B-ms98-a-0031 245.634125 256.505125 it's just it it's a really tough question and it you know it people have have really quieted down after everything started but i still think there's a lot of there's a lot of resentment

sw2537B-ms98-a-0033 268.091000 269.589875 uh-huh

sw2537B-ms98-a-0035 272.626375 274.011000 you bet
sw2537B-ms98-a-0036 274.011000 280.550000 [silence]
sw2537B-ms98-a-0037 280.550000 282.665625 no that's right
sw2537B-ms98-a-0038 282.665625 296.836375 yeah i- i know of some people who did uh it was it was indirectly related you know they could always come up with other reasons but it it had a lot to do with it just uh the the whole attitude because_1 it's really uh
sw2537B-ms98-a-0039 296.836375 306.745375 it's just really it it seems so {unTI} you know with the the whole relaxed atmosphere that we have um to all of a sudden
sw2537B-ms98-a-0040 306.745375 320.654500 uh start forcing attitudes and whatnot you know there's not a lot of pressure to to vote the right way or anything else around TI like there like there is in some companies or at least you know from what i've heard but uh
sw2537B-ms98-a-0041 320.654500 329.425500 yeah [laughter] um-hum no ab[solutely]- absolutely not you know it's it's it's if
sw2537B-ms98-a-0042 329.425500 342.938500 you know if you hired me i'll be you know supposedly you agreed with a majority of my views and my qualifications to begin with so uh you know let's let's stick with that original trust i guess huh
sw2537B-ms98-a-0043 342.938500 353.617125 but uh it's it's still it it still remains a tough question and it's there's a lot of you know the whole the whole department of defense uh
sw2537B-ms98-a-0044 353.617125 367.915375 reasoning behind the original plan and whatnot there's a lot of different things that uh come into play but that was i think everybody everybody pretty much knows that that was kind of a smoke screen to implement it throughout the whole company
sw2537B-ms98-a-0045 367.915375 379.289750 [silence]
sw2537B-ms98-a-0046 379.289750 380.756250 um-hum

sw2537B-ms98-a-0048 387.761500 398.716500 i really don't think so yeah i really don't because some people are going to are are going to risk it um it may prevent
sw2537B-ms98-a-0049 398.716500 400.047750 [silence]
sw2537B-ms98-a-0050 400.047750 405.941875 [laughter] i- i guess i guess what i'm trying to get at is if it if it if it does help
sw2537B-ms98-a-0051 405.941875 417.257125 a few individuals maybe maybe it's worth it um you know it may prevent somebody who was was teetering on the edge of experimenting or whatnot but uh
sw2537B-ms98-a-0052 417.257125 427.222750 i don't know if you know the it's it's a needs of the few and the needs of the many type situation i don't know if everybody should have to sacrifice quite as much
sw2537B-ms98-a-0053 427.222750 431.615875 there there's still a big question in my mind that the the absolute
sw2537B-ms98-a-0054 431.615875 438.876375 refusal to accept the possibility of of mistakes on the testing is something that still bothers me it it's
sw2537B-ms98-a-0055 438.876375 446.850000 [silence]
sw2537B-ms98-a-0056 446.850000 448.923875 um-hum
sw2537B-ms98-a-0057 448.923875 459.576000 um-hum absolutely and that i- i don't know if uh i don't know if everybody understands all the implications on that too e[ven]- even if you 
sw2537B-ms98-a-0058 459.576000 470.477500 you know if you take uh a a drug that was presc[ribed]- prescribed for you but the the prescription has run out you still had some left and you happen to take an extra
sw2537B-ms98-a-0059 470.477500 482.241250 penicillin well penicillin's not on the list but you know yeah i- i think you understand what i'm getting at it it can still show up and it can still flag as a positive and and those kinds of things obviously that's not the intent
sw2537B-ms98-a-0060 482.241250 485.634250 and uh those are the kinds of things that still can show up
sw2537B-ms98-a-0061 485.634250 491.492250 [silence]
sw2537B-ms98-a-0062 491.492250 493.310375 um-hum

sw2537B-ms98-a-0066 500.053750 505.746125 that's right i even had friends when i was going to college who were in uh
sw2537B-ms98-a-0067 505.746125 520.249750 who are in pharmacy school and they could legally um provide medicine to their family mens fa[mily]- family members and friends certain medicines were were legal now i- i- i believe
sw2537B-ms98-a-0068 520.249750 533.907125 you know any of the any of the ones we would we would be tested for wouldn't be on those lists but uh um there were certain things that they could provide without a doctors prescription based on their qualifications and that can happen but uh
sw2537B-ms98-a-0069 533.907125 537.164625 [silence]
