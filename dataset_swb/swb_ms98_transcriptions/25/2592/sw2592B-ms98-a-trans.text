sw2592B-ms98-a-0011 96.061000 116.357750 [silence]
sw2592B-ms98-a-0012 116.357750 125.473125 i think i think uh i think that is and and we we got involved really in in two ways uh my oldest daughter
sw2592B-ms98-a-0013 125.473125 133.653000 i guess when she went uh was in the first grade brought home a note saying uh we're getting up a soccer team and we're getting a chance to play soccer
sw2592B-ms98-a-0014 133.653000 145.331750 and uh so gee you know this was nineteen seventy three and none of us had ever even seen a soccer game so then so then we go out and watch it and she enjoys it and they play the fall season and spring season so she played two seasons in the first grade and 
sw2592B-ms98-a-0015 145.331750 155.887125 was pretty good at it and then in the second grade they said uh oh the coach moved away uh call all the parents and say well who's going to uh coach well no gee you know [laughter-we] [laughter-really] don't have time for that 
sw2592B-ms98-a-0016 155.887125 164.412375 then about the third call they said we want to know we're going to refund the contracts and the money for these kids because nobody's going to coach and think that's terrible so at that point you know you come forward
sw2592B-ms98-a-0017 164.412375 176.019375 well that started about a fifteen year career of [laughter-coaching] uh coaching administering programs and my wife and i in addition to coaching i think when we finally finished up we were managing
sw2592B-ms98-a-0018 176.019375 187.514250 uh as our volunteer time managing a program with seventy two hundred kids in it from grades uh kindergarten through twelfth grade and year around baseball softball soccer [laughter]
sw2592B-ms98-a-0019 187.514250 189.903500 [laughter] yeah 
sw2592B-ms98-a-0020 189.903500 201.461375 oh they are are and and and you know my twenty three year old she's a senior in college and she comes in now and she just loves to pick out the picture book we took a lot of pictures at the time dad do you remember that sixth grade team we had that year dad God we were great weren't we [laughter]
sw2592B-ms98-a-0021 201.461375 226.312000 [laughter] yeah yeah 
sw2592B-ms98-a-0022 226.312000 227.482625 oh yeah
sw2592B-ms98-a-0023 227.482625 231.604500 [silence]
sw2592B-ms98-a-0024 231.604500 233.016625 i'll say
sw2592B-ms98-a-0025 233.016625 236.242125 [silence]
sw2592B-ms98-a-0026 236.242125 237.054625 yeah
sw2592B-ms98-a-0027 237.054625 246.880500 [silence]
sw2592B-ms98-a-0028 246.880500 249.794375 yeah oh sure that'll help yeah
sw2592B-ms98-a-0029 249.794375 275.688750 [silence]
sw2592B-ms98-a-0030 275.688750 290.262250 well now i- i think that they're not uh uh i see too many uh you i recognize that yes a a lot of families need two incomes in fact my wife's working as we the kids all start college and we're looking forward to the prospect of having three in there uh they they have to
sw2592B-ms98-a-0031 290.262250 298.726125 uh both work but another activity that i found very rewarding and i don't know whether you've got it up there are Indian Guides and Indian Princess programs
sw2592B-ms98-a-0032 298.726125 310.441750 popular in that area okay well what this is is it's it's really sponsored by the Y but it's nonsectarian uh is that it's the concept was
sw2592B-ms98-a-0033 310.441750 318.430750 that i think it originally started with Indian Guides and uh the idea was that dads are off working all the time and mothers are left to raise the kids
sw2592B-ms98-a-0034 318.430750 326.642875 so uh uh it it it is a program that requires uh dads and ju[st]- and it started out with with fathers and sons
sw2592B-ms98-a-0035 326.642875 339.172875 where they get together in what they call tribes which is a neighborhood with probably five or six or maybe up to eight uh father son combinations and they get together and and meet at each other's home uh maybe uh twice a month 
sw2592B-ms98-a-0036 339.172875 353.143875 uh to uh uh have uh uh games and uh work on crafts and work on projects and and refreshments and you take Indian names and wear headbands and act like in and uh learn a little about Indian
sw2592B-ms98-a-0037 353.143875 368.119125 uh things but then uh the highlight is that you go camping twice a year like you go out to some uh camping spot and live outdoors uh in the fall and in the spring and you like you go out on a Friday night and come back on Sunday morning and it is uh it's to force
sw2592B-ms98-a-0038 368.119125 382.279375 uh the kids away from the mothers for a litt[le]- a little bit and it's even to the point where the host family at the meetings at each other's homes have to pro[vide]- uh uh have to provide refreshments and they've got to be cooked by you and you can't say mom make some cookies for us
sw2592B-ms98-a-0039 382.279375 391.237125 so part of the thing is when the father and son or father and daughter are hosting this meeting that the week they have to plan it together what they're going to do when they're the host
sw2592B-ms98-a-0040 391.237125 401.899500 and what was interesting i got started in Indians and Princesses now an offshoot to this was i think this program went on maybe for thirty years or so and somebody got to thinking well it's even more important
sw2592B-ms98-a-0041 401.899500 404.408125 it's even more important for dads and daughters
sw2592B-ms98-a-0042 404.408125 411.145750 to get involved in something like this because a lot of families think well you know i- i- i'll bring up the son mom and you bring up the daughters
sw2592B-ms98-a-0043 411.145750 420.780625 and they don't notice the daughters until they're fourteen or fifteen and start getting into trouble so uh uh because my son was the third one i really got into it with both of the girls first
sw2592B-ms98-a-0044 420.780625 433.656750 and uh we just had a ton of fun and i- i- look back now as i say the the two girls are both in college but when they're here and we're we're talking about and we're digging out the old pictures books and my twenty we took a lot of eight millimeter movies
sw2592B-ms98-a-0045 433.656750 446.783000 of uh of uh Indian Princess camp and my uh uh my my twenty three year old has has hoarded all the movies [laughter-now] and and and just sets up the projector in her room and [laughter-watches] them every once in a while uh going back to things like that and
sw2592B-ms98-a-0046 446.783000 448.709375 boy those these are so many
sw2592B-ms98-a-0047 448.709375 453.867750 precious things that you can't ever buy back and and to answer your question
sw2592B-ms98-a-0048 453.867750 464.049125 yeah i- i don't see it we've got a lot of younger families in our neighborhood and everybody's so busy out there making a living uh you can see why the well i know uh
sw2592B-ms98-a-0049 464.049125 475.390375 uh my daughter who's a freshman in college this year her last couple of years in high school she made mo[ney]- money baby sitting and you can tell by the number of people that would have her come and and spend the day
sw2592B-ms98-a-0050 475.390375 486.155375 uh my goodness she went out on one job she was only seventeen i can't believe the lady gave it to her she said she interviewed nineteen people and she was the one she hired this was uh a three week old
sw2592B-ms98-a-0051 486.155375 492.175250 she went to the house at eight o'clock in the morning and and both these uh uh there were there was an only child
sw2592B-ms98-a-0052 492.175250 498.113375 and both parents were professional uh they were professional people i mean he was an engineer and she was a computer programmer
sw2592B-ms98-a-0053 498.113375 507.902500 but she went to work at eight o'clock in the morning and Tracy'd get there at seven thirty and have complete charge of this then three week old until the mother came home at uh at four or four thirty
sw2592B-ms98-a-0054 507.902500 534.313750 and yeah yeah hm um-hum yeah 
sw2592B-ms98-a-0055 534.313750 537.901500 yeah what what what kind of engineering were you in
