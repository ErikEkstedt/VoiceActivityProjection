sw2592A-ms98-a-0011 28.593375 43.076750 well you now they're especially the older one uh they they're into their sports and their friends a lot you know the younger one's getting into it more uh what we enjoy doing with them which we started a year ago was um
sw2592A-ms98-a-0012 43.076750 50.995875 we go on fishing you know day time trips with them the younger one especially is really good at it [laughter] he enjoys fishing
sw2592A-ms98-a-0013 50.995875 64.847000 um they like to go to a place here called uh Chuckie Cheese which is really like a crazy arcade type of thing has a lot of games um and we you know we like to do outdoors types of things with them um
sw2592A-ms98-a-0014 64.847000 76.288625 i just got a bike myself because i'm hoping you [laughter-know] eventually maybe you know for hikes or you know going out along the canal area or whatever to ride bikes with them
sw2592A-ms98-a-0015 76.288625 88.375250 and um you know we enjoy um we enjoy doing more things outdoor playing ball with them my husband likes to play freeze tag with them and and i think as American parents we probably we spend more
sw2592A-ms98-a-0016 88.375250 97.864500 time than is typical i think uh with the kids and part of that is that they're demanding of it you [laughter-know] they they want our time
sw2592A-ms98-a-0017 97.864500 110.479000 uh and uh my husband enjoys you know doing those things with them he spends a lot of time with them and it seems to me anyway from observing other families in the neighborhood that he spends a lot more time
sw2592A-ms98-a-0018 110.479000 116.740000 i'd say on the average than um a lot of the dads do here and i think that's good i think it's real important

sw2592A-ms98-a-0035 200.866250 212.712000 that's right i and i really uh i really think it's very important and i'm very sensitive to it because i always felt that my parents are more [vocalized-noise] uh old school and they were older parents
sw2592A-ms98-a-0036 212.712000 219.459000 and they didn't do a lot of things with us that way and i always felt that i missed out that way and so i want to make sure
sw2592A-ms98-a-0037 219.459000 232.890750 that we spend a lot of time doing activities with the kids and i think a lot of times the parents have fun as [laughter-well] and uh you know now that summer's coming of course i'm sure in Dallas it's already hot but up here
sw2592A-ms98-a-0038 232.890750 243.325875 well we've had last weekend we had eighty seven which was extraordinarily hot for now but now we're back down to about fifty and it's raining here but um
sw2592A-ms98-a-0039 243.325875 249.329625 uh you know soon next end of next month the pools are open the outdoor pools only open over the summer
sw2592A-ms98-a-0040 249.329625 261.073375 and that's an activity that i you know take up with the kids and we're starting to hit some tennis balls around uh but as as they're getting more fun for us as well and i find that we're 
sw2592A-ms98-a-0041 261.073375 266.946625 starting to doing more of those types of things as they get a little bit older um but
sw2592A-ms98-a-0042 266.946625 276.006250 yeah i was going to say what do you feel in general do you feel that um American families are spen[ding]- spending enough time with their children or what changes do you

sw2592A-ms98-a-0106 507.535375 519.348000 right right yeah i think and i think that's uh uh part of the problem now i was uh uh i was in engineering myself um right now i'm taking uh a year off but uh
sw2592A-ms98-a-0107 519.348000 526.870000 it was it's very difficult even when i worked i insisted on working thirty hours not forty so i was really considered
sw2592A-ms98-a-0108 526.870000 538.145750 part time and that was kind of difficult because that concept when you get into professions like that isn't really there yet [laughter] so i really had to hound them for that i was a civil engineer
sw2592A-ms98-a-0109 538.145750 545.698750 and it was really important for me to be able to be out in time to swing by the school and pick my son up
sw2592A-ms98-a-0110 545.698750 553.454375 and of course the younger one was in day care but you find even working six hours a day and not eight hours or whatever that
sw2592A-ms98-a-0111 553.454375 561.308500 it cuts into your time so much and what happens really is that even though i had the time with them in the evenings all the things that
sw2592A-ms98-a-0112 561.308500 569.246500 y[ou]- y[ou]- you know normally you can get done during the week um you save up for the weekend so your whole weekend that your kids really want your attention
sw2592A-ms98-a-0113 569.246500 574.177500 but you're saying oh can you go play now or whatever because you have so many things to catch up on
sw2592A-ms98-a-0114 574.177500 584.308250 and i think that's what you know i think it really uh that's what makes it very makes it difficult and uh this year's much more relaxed [laughter]
sw2592A-ms98-a-0115 584.308250 587.942375 you know and um a lot of people said they've seen
sw2592A-ms98-a-0116 587.942375 600.145875 very big changes in my boys for the better you know and um i think that you know i've i've done both sides and it's it's no matter what people say it it is too difficult
