sw2570A-ms98-a-0065 274.835750 284.497250 well you know in when we used to sew we'd sew the seam and then we'd finish the edges and we we would uh trim the seams and finish the edges
sw2570A-ms98-a-0066 284.497250 288.240625 well this machine does it all in one step it's
sw2570A-ms98-a-0067 288.240625 289.830125 [silence]
sw2570A-ms98-a-0068 289.830125 301.067500 right and it's cutting off the uh the there there are two knives and it cuts off the uh you know excess seam allowance

sw2570A-ms98-a-0070 303.901250 307.672625 and uh it it really makes it look professional
sw2570A-ms98-a-0071 307.672625 314.557250 especially on you know i mean from the inside you know how you look under under something that you've made and it doesn't really
sw2570A-ms98-a-0072 314.557250 318.172750 but uh the Serger really makes it look professional
sw2570A-ms98-a-0073 318.172750 323.083250 they're pretty expensive i like i paid like about eight hundred dollars for mine

sw2570A-ms98-a-0123 485.995125 493.658500 well that's about it really it's it has four uh four threads instead of the the regular basic two threads
sw2570A-ms98-a-0124 493.658500 496.420500 and uh it's
sw2570A-ms98-a-0125 496.420500 498.621000 [silence]
sw2570A-ms98-a-0126 498.621000 503.081500 no you you can either use three or four of the threads
sw2570A-ms98-a-0127 503.081500 511.507000 uh it's kind of it the stitch is kind of like a knitting machine like the they're loopers under the bottom
sw2570A-ms98-a-0128 511.507000 520.187375 and then the there's a seam stitch and it's the loopers that form the the edge you know that edge finish
sw2570A-ms98-a-0129 520.187375 530.367125 and uh that's what really makes it look professional you can do a lot with the Serger though you can make uh piping and cording and
sw2570A-ms98-a-0130 530.367125 534.030625 uh you can use all kinds of different uh
sw2570A-ms98-a-0131 534.030625 536.336875 textures of thread
sw2570A-ms98-a-0132 536.336875 537.669125 and

sw2570A-ms98-a-0136 553.768750 558.402625 seams that need to be really strong need to be done on the sewing machine

sw2570A-ms98-a-0140 575.385625 580.767125 a regular sewing machine does that it doesn't do like you can't top stitch with it
