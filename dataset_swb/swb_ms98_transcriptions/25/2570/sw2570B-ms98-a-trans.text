sw2570B-ms98-a-0005 27.120875 31.789875 so uh you know i didn't have access to a machine the whole time i was in college
sw2570B-ms98-a-0006 31.789875 38.299250 and uh my sister sewed and she needed the money so i would pay her and she'd make my clothes [laughter]

sw2570B-ms98-a-0012 65.803500 75.146000 uh now it's a little more expensive to make it because y[ou]- you know you start paying the price for the patterns and the material but it's still such better quality that i think it's worth it
sw2570B-ms98-a-0013 75.146000 84.685625 [silence]

sw2570B-ms98-a-0042 203.100125 211.051500 and i asked my roommate if she would teach me how to crochet granny squares so she did and i crocheted a blanket for my sister's baby
sw2570B-ms98-a-0043 211.051500 216.112375 and i started crocheting a king size bedspread for a guy that i was dating at the time
sw2570B-ms98-a-0044 216.112375 228.837625 and when we broke things off actually we were supposed to get married when i got out of college so when we broke things off i quit crocheting it and i've never picked up a needle since then in fact i think it's still sitting in the top of the closet [laughter]
sw2570B-ms98-a-0045 228.837625 233.990750 one of these days i keep thinking i'm going to finish it because it would make a really pretty bedspread [laughter]

sw2570B-ms98-a-0052 272.392750 274.486375 i don't think so
sw2570B-ms98-a-0053 274.486375 280.218000 [silence]
sw2570B-ms98-a-0054 280.218000 281.711750 sure

sw2570B-ms98-a-0077 346.853750 348.637250 oh so do i
sw2570B-ms98-a-0078 348.637250 361.941750 exc[ept]- well i have one here it's the one that i grew up with and my folks gave it to me and uh a couple years ago when they uh they sail and so they sold their home and they they've been sailing and uh 
sw2570B-ms98-a-0079 361.941750 374.398875 so it's here but i haven't touched one like since college so i kind of am picking it all out again and trying to remember how to do it again and of course my kids jump in the middle of it and want to pound on it and i'd love to teach them to play too
sw2570B-ms98-a-0080 374.398875 377.452375 so i'm not great but i remember it [laughter] 
sw2570B-ms98-a-0081 377.452375 382.753000 [silence]
sw2570B-ms98-a-0082 382.753000 384.228125 yeah
sw2570B-ms98-a-0083 384.228125 393.602625 [silence]
sw2570B-ms98-a-0084 393.602625 395.264375 you do
sw2570B-ms98-a-0085 395.264375 397.486625 you do [laughter]
sw2570B-ms98-a-0086 397.486625 399.650000 [silence]
sw2570B-ms98-a-0087 399.650000 410.281500 well i i figure it takes practice and i i don't i say i don't have the time that's not true by the time i put my kids in bed at night i don't want to do anything
sw2570B-ms98-a-0088 410.281500 422.893875 i you know i've worked all day and i come home and i do that i and you know even hobbies and crafts and sewing things like that i i think gee i could do this or that i have an hour here i don't want to do them sometimes i'm too tired
sw2570B-ms98-a-0089 422.893875 428.206750 so i try to save that for the weekend i need to get better at it though [laughter]
sw2570B-ms98-a-0090 428.206750 432.088375 [silence]
sw2570B-ms98-a-0091 432.088375 440.627875 now the part about sewing that i never liked was laying out the material and the pattern and cutting it out if if somebody would lay it out for me
sw2570B-ms98-a-0092 440.627875 446.968500 then i didn't mind cutting it out and sewing it i could do that all day long and i i can remember once in high school i wanted some extra money
sw2570B-ms98-a-0093 446.968500 455.445625 and my mom wanted some pants so she laid out the material and i cut it and sewed it and she paid me i think like two dollars a pair [laughter] to make her some pants
sw2570B-ms98-a-0094 455.445625 463.427000 but i i hate laying out material and trying to get the most out of the material and make sure it's on the right lines and not on the bias and 
sw2570B-ms98-a-0095 463.427000 466.559125 yes on the grain of the fabric
sw2570B-ms98-a-0096 466.559125 469.032875 it drives me crazy [laughter]
sw2570B-ms98-a-0097 469.032875 471.785500 [silence]
sw2570B-ms98-a-0098 471.785500 473.317875 yeah
sw2570B-ms98-a-0099 473.317875 481.381375 [silence]
sw2570B-ms98-a-0100 481.381375 485.492250 well what are some of the other features on this machine it sounds wonderful
sw2570B-ms98-a-0101 485.492250 492.531500 [silence]
sw2570B-ms98-a-0102 492.531500 494.719750 oh okay
sw2570B-ms98-a-0103 494.719750 499.575875 is that for designs or is that for the regular seam in the fabric or
sw2570B-ms98-a-0104 499.575875 502.576500 [silence]
sw2570B-ms98-a-0105 502.576500 503.796000 oh okay
sw2570B-ms98-a-0106 503.796000 518.677125 [silence]
sw2570B-ms98-a-0107 518.677125 520.259500 uh-huh
sw2570B-ms98-a-0108 520.259500 535.805375 [silence]
sw2570B-ms98-a-0109 535.805375 540.692125 so it has the ability to do just about any type of sewing you want to do
sw2570B-ms98-a-0110 540.692125 551.682125 [silence]
sw2570B-ms98-a-0111 551.682125 553.249250 uh-huh
sw2570B-ms98-a-0112 553.249250 558.458875 [silence]
sw2570B-ms98-a-0113 558.458875 563.735250 so the Serger is not a sewing machine itself it's something that goes with it
sw2570B-ms98-a-0114 563.735250 566.150500 like an attachment or
sw2570B-ms98-a-0115 566.150500 580.309625 [silence]
sw2570B-ms98-a-0116 580.309625 582.036375 oh okay
sw2570B-ms98-a-0117 582.036375 590.692250 [silence]
sw2570B-ms98-a-0118 590.692250 592.116750 uh-huh
sw2570B-ms98-a-0119 592.116750 596.934250 [silence]
sw2570B-ms98-a-0120 596.934250 600.146375 well i'm going to have to go check it out that's just something i hadn't heard of but it
