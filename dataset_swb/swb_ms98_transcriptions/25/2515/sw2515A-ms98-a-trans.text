sw2515A-ms98-a-0006 7.967750 12.831750 [silence]
sw2515A-ms98-a-0007 12.831750 21.001250 okay we do a few things and i have to say we're my husband and i are both from financial backgrounds i i'm an accountant
sw2515A-ms98-a-0008 21.001250 30.897000 and uh he has an MBA so uh we were sort of you know keyed in on expenses and things like that [laughter-so] um 
sw2515A-ms98-a-0009 30.897000 39.157250 coming from that background what we pretty much do is we our household as far as living expenses we live on a cash budget
sw2515A-ms98-a-0010 39.157250 51.744625 every month my husband uh goes to the credit union and withdraws you know X amount of dollars for the month and then that money is used during that month we have a certain budget
sw2515A-ms98-a-0011 51.744625 53.384875 [noise] excuse me
sw2515A-ms98-a-0012 53.384875 61.947250 for instance i control all the household expenses the groceries the um haircuts the gasoline for my car 
sw2515A-ms98-a-0013 61.947250 67.190375 any miscellaneous expenses babysitting things like that and uh
sw2515A-ms98-a-0014 67.190375 68.993750 [noise] excuse me
sw2515A-ms98-a-0015 68.993750 78.228625 if uh it comes the end of the month and i don't have any money uh [laughter] we don't buy any more [laughter-milk] [laughter-for] [laughter-instance] 
sw2515A-ms98-a-0016 78.228625 82.888500 but uh we've gotten pretty good at it we've been doing it for a couple of years now 
sw2515A-ms98-a-0017 82.888500 86.196250 so we our budgets are realistic and they are not
sw2515A-ms98-a-0018 86.196250 90.523000 so stringent as you know to make us feel uncomfortable
sw2515A-ms98-a-0019 90.523000 100.427625 uh and i i really try to stretch my my dollars here and there shopping uh at warehouses sometimes like at Sam's and things like that
sw2515A-ms98-a-0020 100.427625 109.257875 but uh we live we live on a on a cash budget and it it sometimes it's tight come the end of the month but generally we always make it 
sw2515A-ms98-a-0021 109.257875 122.641750 [silence]
sw2515A-ms98-a-0022 122.641750 124.100000 right
sw2515A-ms98-a-0023 124.100000 128.016625 [silence]
sw2515A-ms98-a-0024 128.016625 135.909375 well uh most of our medical things we don't uh have to worry about because of insurance and
sw2515A-ms98-a-0025 135.909375 149.093375 they're they're relatively small uh we've been lucky in the past we didn't have that problem but right now we don't for the other things the things that do crop up that we aren't really expecting we have different funds 
sw2515A-ms98-a-0026 149.093375 158.874750 set aside for different things like we have a car fund and we put a certain amount of money into that every single month whether we need to or not
sw2515A-ms98-a-0027 158.874750 162.824625 [noise] so i mean and i'm i [vocalized-noise] i can't really remember what it is 
sw2515A-ms98-a-0028 162.824625 167.889875 [silence]
sw2515A-ms98-a-0029 167.889875 182.185250 um it's all part of the savings account we just keep track of it on paper uh you know a certain amount goes straight to the savings account we decide okay you know let's say it's a hundred dollars you know every month fifteen dollars is for car fund 
sw2515A-ms98-a-0030 182.185250 188.542875 you know [laughter] ten dollars is for vacation fund whatever uh and 
sw2515A-ms98-a-0031 188.542875 199.609875 we just we constantly do that so that there's a build up of money for those things and if something does come up like i know that my washing machine is going to go any day and 
sw2515A-ms98-a-0032 199.609875 204.183375 so but we have the money set aside so if it does it's not going to kill us
sw2515A-ms98-a-0033 204.183375 210.602500 uh so we're we're actually we're pretty disciplined so it makes those surprises not so
sw2515A-ms98-a-0034 210.602500 213.091125 difficult to get through
sw2515A-ms98-a-0035 213.091125 225.084375 [silence]
sw2515A-ms98-a-0036 225.084375 227.444750 well in our 
sw2515A-ms98-a-0037 227.444750 229.664875 [silence]
sw2515A-ms98-a-0038 229.664875 235.180250 uh we have a lot of different things right now we save about twenty five percent
sw2515A-ms98-a-0039 235.180250 238.288125 of our um of our pay 
sw2515A-ms98-a-0040 238.288125 252.030500 it and it goes toward different things it's for you know for vacations like i said for you know emergencies like for car uh breaks down something like that uh and we also put money aside for our kids college
sw2515A-ms98-a-0041 252.030500 263.226875 neither of us had any help with our college degrees and just this last month we paid off my final school loan so [laughter] we're starting our kids a little bit [laughter-early] 
sw2515A-ms98-a-0042 263.226875 264.782375 [silence]
sw2515A-ms98-a-0043 264.782375 270.922375 do you uh use a lot of credit cards or your checking account when you go out and buy things
sw2515A-ms98-a-0044 270.922375 272.598375 [silence]
sw2515A-ms98-a-0045 272.598375 273.857500 uh-huh
sw2515A-ms98-a-0046 273.857500 284.069000 [silence]
sw2515A-ms98-a-0047 284.069000 285.360375 sure
sw2515A-ms98-a-0048 285.360375 294.687875 [silence]
sw2515A-ms98-a-0049 294.687875 295.928250 uh-huh
sw2515A-ms98-a-0050 295.928250 314.707625 [silence]
sw2515A-ms98-a-0051 314.707625 317.113500 right that's good 
sw2515A-ms98-a-0052 317.113500 319.333375 [silence]
sw2515A-ms98-a-0053 319.333375 321.125625 [laughter]
sw2515A-ms98-a-0054 321.125625 333.274125 [silence]
sw2515A-ms98-a-0055 333.274125 337.445625 oh and it's not deductible anymore [laughter]
sw2515A-ms98-a-0056 337.445625 338.458875 [silence]
sw2515A-ms98-a-0057 338.458875 341.498375 or you can deduct it anyway yeah 
sw2515A-ms98-a-0058 341.498375 346.043125 [silence]
sw2515A-ms98-a-0059 346.043125 347.120125 yeah
sw2515A-ms98-a-0060 347.120125 357.934000 we did we did that for a long time and it got to the point where we had no idea how much we were spending on things and it seemed like we didn't have enough money when
sw2515A-ms98-a-0061 357.934000 371.147500 things cropped up you know so we decided to put ourselves on a cash budget [vocalized-noise] well the first time we did it we just took some arbitrary amount that we estimated it would be and then we kept track of everything for a month 
sw2515A-ms98-a-0062 371.147500 381.730750 you know how much we spent on food how much we spent on gasoline how much we spent on everything and from that built you know a cash budget so now i mean i have
sw2515A-ms98-a-0063 381.730750 392.377500 i don't even remember what it is now four hundred dollars for the month let's say and um mean some months i may spend three hundred on groceries and a hundred on everything else and 
sw2515A-ms98-a-0064 392.377500 400.357625 some months it may be different it's not as though we feel like we have to keep ourselves you know down to the dollar or the penny in certain categories kind of thing
sw2515A-ms98-a-0065 400.357625 409.301750 but the way we set up you know the amount that we want to save and the amounts that we have to spend for you know
sw2515A-ms98-a-0066 409.301750 417.037750 uh utilities and uh the house payment and all that those are things you don't really have much control over
sw2515A-ms98-a-0067 417.037750 418.107375 [silence]
sw2515A-ms98-a-0068 418.107375 419.207125 uh
sw2515A-ms98-a-0069 419.207125 429.748875 the cash budget just fits right in there and [laughter] like i said if we don't have we we also set aside money for entertainment i mean it's but again it's a set amount every month 
sw2515A-ms98-a-0070 429.748875 434.025500 and uh on special occasions i mean birthdays and things like that we
sw2515A-ms98-a-0071 434.025500 439.324125 we don't w[e]- we you know we still have fun on [laughter-things] 
sw2515A-ms98-a-0072 439.324125 449.893375 [silence]
sw2515A-ms98-a-0073 449.893375 461.120625 well no not originally because when we we did buy when we bought our first house it was at a time where you and the kind of loan we got you really didn't have to put down anything
sw2515A-ms98-a-0074 461.120625 473.557625 so we got into it fairly cheaply and then uh after we sold the first house we were left with enough cash that there was enough to make the down payment on this house
sw2515A-ms98-a-0075 473.557625 477.552000 so we we got out of that one pretty easily [laughter]
sw2515A-ms98-a-0076 477.552000 497.823250 [silence]
sw2515A-ms98-a-0077 497.823250 500.070000 sure i know
sw2515A-ms98-a-0078 500.070000 504.190000 that's how i feel about sometimes about my kids' education 
sw2515A-ms98-a-0079 504.190000 508.637000 i mean jeez they are one and four [laughter]
sw2515A-ms98-a-0080 508.637000 512.495250 we have got a long time to save up my husband he's the real 
sw2515A-ms98-a-0081 512.495250 516.342500 he's the real disciplinarian when it comes to that money usually
sw2515A-ms98-a-0082 516.342500 518.448750 oh no no [laughter]
sw2515A-ms98-a-0083 518.448750 526.376750 [silence]
sw2515A-ms98-a-0084 526.376750 528.869625 what do you do with it i know 
sw2515A-ms98-a-0085 528.869625 538.075000 [silence]
sw2515A-ms98-a-0086 538.075000 539.968625 uh-huh right
sw2515A-ms98-a-0087 539.968625 549.831875 [silence]
sw2515A-ms98-a-0088 549.831875 551.578625 oh yeah
sw2515A-ms98-a-0089 551.578625 557.083875 [silence]
sw2515A-ms98-a-0090 557.083875 560.156750 yeah it's it's amazing how much we spend on
sw2515A-ms98-a-0091 560.156750 562.156375 some things my husband cut him 
sw2515A-ms98-a-0092 562.156375 567.017750 self down to ten dollars a week for his lunch at work 
sw2515A-ms98-a-0093 567.017750 570.449875 and that's all he has he has a ten dollar bill
sw2515A-ms98-a-0094 570.449875 573.173875 and i mean so i'd say at least
sw2515A-ms98-a-0095 573.173875 576.696875 two usually three times a week he takes his lunch
sw2515A-ms98-a-0096 576.696875 578.484250 the other times he'll
sw2515A-ms98-a-0097 578.484250 580.539375 uh i don't know
sw2515A-ms98-a-0098 580.539375 583.299750 go out somewhere eat in a cafeteria or whatever
sw2515A-ms98-a-0099 583.299750 586.514875 but but he keeps himself on that i mean he found
sw2515A-ms98-a-0100 586.514875 590.514625 i mean it's so easy to spend five dollars a day on lunch 
sw2515A-ms98-a-0101 590.514625 592.868375 that's a hundred dollars a month 
sw2515A-ms98-a-0102 592.868375 596.628500 that's that's twelve hundred dollars a year just on lunch [laughter]
sw2515A-ms98-a-0103 596.628500 597.823625 [silence]
sw2515A-ms98-a-0104 597.823625 600.636375 when he can take a sandwich you [laughter-know]
