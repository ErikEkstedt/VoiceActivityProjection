sw2518A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.145125 okay
sw2518A-ms98-a-0002 1.145125 18.425125 [silence]
sw2518A-ms98-a-0003 18.425125 19.706500 yeah
sw2518A-ms98-a-0004 19.706500 23.904625 [silence]
sw2518A-ms98-a-0005 23.904625 25.740250 [laughter]
sw2518A-ms98-a-0006 25.740250 31.751500 [laughter] well it sounds like you're you have the stuff there [laughter]
sw2518A-ms98-a-0007 31.751500 40.209625 yeah w[ell]- well i uh go to aerobics twice a week which i started a little over a year ago
sw2518A-ms98-a-0008 40.209625 55.009750 and i i think that's probably pretty good for me um i part of my incentive when i started was to try to lose a few pounds because i had a special reason you know i wanted to and had a lot of motivation whi[ch]-
sw2518A-ms98-a-0009 55.009750 62.497250 and i did but then you know i just gradually come back up a few pounds anyway which is no big deal i'm not
sw2518A-ms98-a-0010 62.497250 67.750000 over weight or anything but you know how you always want to lose a few and
sw2518A-ms98-a-0011 67.750000 79.164000 i've found that now i i think if i didn't do the aerobics then i'd probably have to do something else because i'd probably gain weight [laughter-you] [laughter-know] because i
sw2518A-ms98-a-0012 79.164000 89.496000 [silence]
sw2518A-ms98-a-0013 89.496000 91.100125 yeah
sw2518A-ms98-a-0014 91.100125 103.774625 [silence]
sw2518A-ms98-a-0015 103.774625 104.998375 yeah
sw2518A-ms98-a-0016 104.998375 106.421750 [silence]
sw2518A-ms98-a-0017 106.421750 110.529875 well i've never paid a whole lot of attention to my diet but
sw2518A-ms98-a-0018 110.529875 115.478500 you know i feel guilty all the time [laughter-because] oh i shouldn't be eating that [laughter]
sw2518A-ms98-a-0019 115.478500 117.300875 [silence]
sw2518A-ms98-a-0020 117.300875 126.195125 not really uh i mean i would just like to be you know five or six pounds thinner but i don't consider that to be that big a deal
sw2518A-ms98-a-0021 126.195125 127.431375 [silence]
sw2518A-ms98-a-0022 127.431375 128.958375 twice a week
sw2518A-ms98-a-0023 128.958375 129.963750 [silence]
sw2518A-ms98-a-0024 129.963750 140.819500 yes uh in fact i probably haven't missed more than five or six times in as i say about a year and three months
sw2518A-ms98-a-0025 140.819500 142.514875 [silence]
sw2518A-ms98-a-0026 142.514875 144.339750 uh-huh
sw2518A-ms98-a-0027 144.339750 156.687000 yeah i i think it's you know at first it it was kind of a drag because i was not used to doing that much of anything and um
sw2518A-ms98-a-0028 156.687000 164.993125 i had been going to school and doing a lot of just you know sitting and studying and and really not working out at all but uh
sw2518A-ms98-a-0029 164.993125 177.185875 now as long as i keep going it's it's not that difficult to do and i can see where you know different muscles and things are in better shape
sw2518A-ms98-a-0030 177.185875 193.199750 [silence]
sw2518A-ms98-a-0031 193.199750 194.599625 yeah
sw2518A-ms98-a-0032 194.599625 206.390750 [silence]
sw2518A-ms98-a-0033 206.390750 208.102500 oh really
sw2518A-ms98-a-0034 208.102500 213.639000 [silence]
sw2518A-ms98-a-0035 213.639000 215.279625 yeah
sw2518A-ms98-a-0036 215.279625 218.370625 [silence]
sw2518A-ms98-a-0037 218.370625 228.929625 yeah there's s[ometimes]- s[ometimes]- sometimes when i go to aerobics and i get all hot you know it's too warm in this place where we go and everything and i'm thinking why am i doing [laughter-this]
sw2518A-ms98-a-0038 228.929625 237.598250 but like i say it just kind of becomes a habit and it's if if you don't break that cycle very often then you keep doing it
sw2518A-ms98-a-0039 237.598250 250.549625 [silence]
sw2518A-ms98-a-0040 250.549625 262.181000 yeah well i think one thing too that makes this easier for me is that i uh do this at a recreation center and it takes me about three minutes to drive up there
sw2518A-ms98-a-0041 262.181000 272.466625 if i had to go you know several miles if it took me ten or fifteen or twenty minutes each way i probably would quit doing it
sw2518A-ms98-a-0042 272.466625 282.278000 no uh in fact that's kind of uh one of the things that's uh funny about it is i go at eight o'clock at night
sw2518A-ms98-a-0043 282.278000 290.509625 yeah and you'd think well who wants to get up and go then but um it's really not been that much of a problem
sw2518A-ms98-a-0044 290.509625 291.520500 [silence]
sw2518A-ms98-a-0045 291.520500 292.768000 yeah
sw2518A-ms98-a-0046 292.768000 299.445375 yeah well my husband and i were also doing quite a bit of walking but we got off of that a little bit
sw2518A-ms98-a-0047 299.445375 302.502875 uh mostly you know with the winter months and all it
sw2518A-ms98-a-0048 302.502875 308.260000 seems like there are too many reasons that you can't go because of the weather and things and
sw2518A-ms98-a-0049 308.260000 310.561250 [silence]
sw2518A-ms98-a-0050 310.561250 324.509750 not really and he needs to but uh he's a CPA so at the moment he's snowed under until after tax season but i'm definitely going to get him back on something because he has a few
sw2518A-ms98-a-0051 324.509750 329.473500 kind of nagging health things that i think you know some more exercise would help
sw2518A-ms98-a-0052 329.473500 331.056625 [silence]
sw2518A-ms98-a-0053 331.056625 333.427250 yeah yeah
sw2518A-ms98-a-0054 333.427250 335.743500 [silence]
sw2518A-ms98-a-0055 335.743500 350.568375 yeah we've had a couple of them_1 in the class and oh uh they've kind of stuck with it one of them_1 though has been coming with his girlfriend and they're about to get married in a couple of weeks so it might be interesting to see if they [laughter-stick] [laughter-with] [laughter-it]
sw2518A-ms98-a-0056 350.568375 355.790625 [laughter] but um i also swim quite a bit in the summer time
sw2518A-ms98-a-0057 355.790625 372.821375 [silence]
sw2518A-ms98-a-0058 372.821375 382.075000 well i'm not gung ho you know i but i'm not opposed to any of o[f]- you know kinds of things i just don't do a lot of them
sw2518A-ms98-a-0059 382.075000 389.211875 you know it's tough to to work everything in that you want to accomplish and i have a lot of other interests
sw2518A-ms98-a-0060 389.211875 393.136750 [silence]
sw2518A-ms98-a-0061 393.136750 397.358750 [laughter]
sw2518A-ms98-a-0062 397.358750 398.763625 well
sw2518A-ms98-a-0063 398.763625 399.982000 [silence]
sw2518A-ms98-a-0064 399.982000 405.508875 well you'll have to [vocalized-noise] start working on your machines because_1 that's nice that you have those things
sw2518A-ms98-a-0065 405.508875 421.328250 [silence]
sw2518A-ms98-a-0066 421.328250 422.453625 yeah
sw2518A-ms98-a-0067 422.453625 436.784500 [silence]
sw2518A-ms98-a-0068 436.784500 438.459500 yeah
sw2518A-ms98-a-0069 438.459500 445.663250 [silence]
sw2518A-ms98-a-0070 445.663250 452.910125 yeah that might be good i have a a friend who uh needed to lose a lot of weight and she and uh another
sw2518A-ms98-a-0071 452.910125 464.657375 friend of hers decided to start walking and they were doing i don't know several miles each night and boy she really got the weight off yeah really
sw2518A-ms98-a-0072 464.657375 471.606875 [silence]

sw2518A-ms98-a-0074 472.965875 480.030250 [silence]
sw2518A-ms98-a-0075 480.030250 487.494500 yeah it it helps a lot with the walking because otherwise it's just plain boring
sw2518A-ms98-a-0076 487.494500 498.572375 uh to me at least i don't like to go out by myself but that's when we do the most talking and you know about things that have taken place during the day and
sw2518A-ms98-a-0077 498.572375 504.701000 all sorts of things that i don't think you know we typically do [laughter] we don't take that much time to talk
sw2518A-ms98-a-0078 504.701000 505.864125 so
sw2518A-ms98-a-0079 505.864125 507.027125 [silence]
