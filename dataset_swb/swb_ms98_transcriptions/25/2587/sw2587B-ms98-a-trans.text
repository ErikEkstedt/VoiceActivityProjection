sw2587B-ms98-a-0016 59.357250 61.448125 [silence]
sw2587B-ms98-a-0017 61.448125 63.920000 and uh it it's pretty much headline news
sw2587B-ms98-a-0018 63.920000 67.268750 which isn't you know pretty much what we loo[k]- look for anyway
sw2587B-ms98-a-0019 67.268750 72.308750 [silence]
sw2587B-ms98-a-0020 72.308750 80.443750 but uh i do you think that the quality of the uh the you know the news events that you get are what do you think about it

sw2587B-ms98-a-0024 95.643875 100.049750 yeah well you know there's a lot of competition in the media
sw2587B-ms98-a-0025 100.049750 107.656000 and sometimes i think it too much trying to figure out who's going to get the best headlines and that they'll run a topic into the ground
sw2587B-ms98-a-0026 107.656000 109.777875 and uh
sw2587B-ms98-a-0027 109.777875 117.516000 you know they try to play public's opinion which i think is awful because it usually works
sw2587B-ms98-a-0028 117.516000 124.554375 [silence]
sw2587B-ms98-a-0029 124.554375 134.700875 yes uh-huh that uh l[ots]- lots of new uh newsmen were created during that so it will be interesting to see what happens

sw2587B-ms98-a-0031 140.534875 142.089875 [laughter]

sw2587B-ms98-a-0038 155.569375 167.783125 yeah i hate to see that but it's uh th[at]- that you know if what it's going to take well you know we can deduct that from our income tax our federal income tax
sw2587B-ms98-a-0039 167.783125 172.268250 but uh you know but we need good schools
sw2587B-ms98-a-0040 172.268250 174.282750 uh
sw2587B-ms98-a-0041 174.282750 177.961625 we're more involved in that now and i i
sw2587B-ms98-a-0042 177.961625 182.217625 i i think it's better for everybody if we had better schools
sw2587B-ms98-a-0043 182.217625 184.658000 [silence]
sw2587B-ms98-a-0044 184.658000 185.701500 so

sw2587B-ms98-a-0051 200.643875 203.010250 so i mean it wouldn't have been as painful
sw2587B-ms98-a-0052 203.010250 211.130000 as what we would've paid in state income tax i mean [laughter] probably would have paid the same amount but you know it's not the idea of your paying uh income tax
sw2587B-ms98-a-0053 211.130000 214.341125 [silence]
sw2587B-ms98-a-0054 214.341125 215.203500 so

sw2587B-ms98-a-0070 272.009125 282.095375 right but i understand why Bush you know doesn't want to go in and and uh take sides i mean because that would definitely look like another Korea
sw2587B-ms98-a-0071 282.095375 289.437125 and he'd have all these people jumping down his back even though i'd agree with it i think he ought to should've gone in there and blew them away
