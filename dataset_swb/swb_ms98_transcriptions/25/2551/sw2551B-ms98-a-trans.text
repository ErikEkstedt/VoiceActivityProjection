sw2551B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.582250 [noise]
sw2551B-ms98-a-0002 1.582250 4.720625 [silence]
sw2551B-ms98-a-0003 4.720625 7.043875 well um
sw2551B-ms98-a-0004 7.043875 21.308250 starting with my work um we're in a uh aluminum can and paper recycling um i work for TI and there's a uh a lot of paper that gets thrown away here so we've started recycling our uh plain white paper
sw2551B-ms98-a-0005 21.308250 31.109625 and we have a a company that collects it and takes care of tha[t]- that for us uh in the community um Baltimore County that i that's the county i used to live in
sw2551B-ms98-a-0006 31.109625 40.919125 um they just started experimenting with uh trash pickup where uh one day a week they pick up recycled items and then another day a week they pick up
sw2551B-ms98-a-0007 40.919125 52.897750 the other trash and uh they've uh contracted with a company here that has a special truck that has different containers on the same truck you know one that holds paper one that holds plastic one that holds tin one that holds aluminum
sw2551B-ms98-a-0008 52.897750 64.823125 and uh so they've they've started experimenting with doing it um on a very large scale also in Baltimore City they've started doing it uh there's been a lot of awareness um
sw2551B-ms98-a-0009 64.823125 76.144750 especially here on the east coast because our landfills are you know so filled now that uh there's just not enough room for all the garbage that we uh that we create
sw2551B-ms98-a-0010 76.144750 80.052750 [silence]
sw2551B-ms98-a-0011 80.052750 84.994250 that's right and the barge from New York that went around the world and [laughter]
sw2551B-ms98-a-0012 84.994250 86.122250 [silence]
sw2551B-ms98-a-0013 86.122250 87.511750 [laughter]
sw2551B-ms98-a-0014 87.511750 124.470500 [silence]
sw2551B-ms98-a-0015 124.470500 126.186875 um-hum
sw2551B-ms98-a-0016 126.186875 171.709125 [silence]
sw2551B-ms98-a-0017 171.709125 181.645125 yeah that's uh it's been a problem that i've noticed a lot in print that uh um once you have collected this
sw2551B-ms98-a-0018 181.645125 193.207875 what do you do with it because there's not a whole lot of companies that are taking it there's a lot of people that want to participate and given the facilities will participate and they've proven that time and time again
sw2551B-ms98-a-0019 193.207875 201.474750 and uh i was just reading some figures this morning that seventy nine percent of the people polled considered themselves to be environmentalists
sw2551B-ms98-a-0020 201.474750 213.426875 and so uh you know it looks like there's a lot of people there who want to do it there's just not a lot of companies out there that know what to do with it another problem that that's uh is plastic milk cartons
sw2551B-ms98-a-0021 213.426875 227.736375 they've got a way to recycle them_1 they've got places that can recycle them_1 into products no problem the problem is that they can't there's no facility to get it from the people that have the raw material the empty milk cartons
sw2551B-ms98-a-0022 227.736375 230.020000 back to the guy who can do something with it
sw2551B-ms98-a-0023 230.020000 239.965750 and uh in order for this company to survive they've had to uh in their area start sponsoring their own recycling centers
sw2551B-ms98-a-0024 239.965750 248.084500 in order to get the raw goods but they you know of course they ca[n]- they're limited with what they can do they can only do so much and uh
sw2551B-ms98-a-0025 248.084500 261.681750 you know it's it's a matter of i- i don't think you know i hate to get government involved with anything because_1 it always costs more money but um you know it's a matter of they're going to have to pass stricter laws or start making
sw2551B-ms98-a-0026 261.681750 266.083125 the garbage collection um more costly
sw2551B-ms98-a-0027 266.083125 273.604125 and once they do that then people will be more interested right now it doesn't matter how much garbage you put out to the road it's a flat fee a month
sw2551B-ms98-a-0028 273.604125 278.961500 if they started billing people by the pound things might change drastically
sw2551B-ms98-a-0029 278.961500 287.027125 [silence]
sw2551B-ms98-a-0030 287.027125 288.761375 that's right
sw2551B-ms98-a-0031 288.761375 300.883125 [silence]
sw2551B-ms98-a-0032 300.883125 302.233125 yeah
sw2551B-ms98-a-0033 302.233125 327.340000 [silence]
sw2551B-ms98-a-0034 327.340000 341.120000 well actually there's a gentleman down in Atlanta who has invented a process using a certain acid and he can take a tire and turn it into immediately burnable oil
sw2551B-ms98-a-0035 341.120000 343.719500 [silence]
sw2551B-ms98-a-0036 343.719500 349.437125 it has less sulfur in it than processed fuel oil for the house
sw2551B-ms98-a-0037 349.437125 360.060000 it does nothing to hurt the environment and the heat generated by the process is in turn used to run the machine so it's self-sufficient
sw2551B-ms98-a-0038 360.060000 371.095375 and very efficient i mean it it control you know it it [vocalized-noise] controls its own process it burns it reduces the amount of fuel that's required in order to
sw2551B-ms98-a-0039 371.095375 384.986250 get out the fuel at the other end um so far they've demonstrated it on a uh garage size unit that this guy invented they're currently looking for funding to build a larger scale and i saw this about three months ago
sw2551B-ms98-a-0040 384.986250 396.201125 [silence]
sw2551B-ms98-a-0041 396.201125 407.285625 well if you think about it if um uh i remember that when they used to take uh they used to pay you to take the tire you know get the turn in your tire when you got your
sw2551B-ms98-a-0042 407.285625 418.283125 and your your husband probably remembers that better than i do i remember there was a time when they'd give you one or two dollars for your used tire now they charge you two [laughter-dollars] for your used [laughter-tire] 
sw2551B-ms98-a-0043 418.283125 438.241875 [silence]
sw2551B-ms98-a-0044 438.241875 439.493625 um-hum
sw2551B-ms98-a-0045 439.493625 440.691125 [silence]
sw2551B-ms98-a-0046 440.691125 441.771625 yeah
sw2551B-ms98-a-0047 441.771625 456.576125 [silence]
sw2551B-ms98-a-0048 456.576125 457.821875 yes
sw2551B-ms98-a-0049 457.821875 463.481500 [silence]
sw2551B-ms98-a-0050 463.481500 476.888000 i saw it on the evening news and um the guy actually took the oil that came out from the process in a measuring cup turned around and poured it right back into the uh tank
sw2551B-ms98-a-0051 476.888000 480.693250 that he was using to fire the process in order to run it
sw2551B-ms98-a-0052 480.693250 488.237875 and you actually um with this process by putting in the tires end up with more energy from the oil
sw2551B-ms98-a-0053 488.237875 495.005875 than you put into the process so it's a way of of making a profit off the tires
sw2551B-ms98-a-0054 495.005875 507.397500 and when you stop and look at the you know something like eight million tires a month that are you know discarded you know there's a lot of tires out there that that could go through this process
sw2551B-ms98-a-0055 507.397500 512.033000 [silence]
sw2551B-ms98-a-0056 512.033000 513.984500 there's not a profit
sw2551B-ms98-a-0057 513.984500 519.207875 [silence]
sw2551B-ms98-a-0058 519.207875 528.715375 i th[ink]- the the problem is that there's there's always a payoff to recycling but it's hard for people to see it
sw2551B-ms98-a-0059 528.715375 538.080375 because it's hard for them it's hard to explain to someone that look it's costing us you know umpteen thousand dollars a year to bury this stuff in the ground
sw2551B-ms98-a-0060 538.080375 543.372750 and then what is the long-term effect of us burying that in the ground if that stuff
sw2551B-ms98-a-0061 543.372750 553.332250 yeah it it's going to leak into our water and then we're going to have problems with our water and then it's going to cause health problems and so there is a long-term
sw2551B-ms98-a-0062 553.332250 560.319250 effect and when you stop and think about it every just about every single thing that's produced can be recycled
sw2551B-ms98-a-0063 560.319250 569.041750 i mean if it's if it's uh foo[d]- you know if it's stuff you scraped off your plate it can go into the compost and you know and so it's i mean
sw2551B-ms98-a-0064 569.041750 583.801125 it there's a way to recycle everything and and um if your husband just retired then i've got to believe that you've got to be old enough to remember that back during the wars hey recycling was the thing to do i mean you didn't
sw2551B-ms98-a-0065 583.801125 590.328875 that's right if you if you didn't recycle you were un-American and and that was the bottom line
sw2551B-ms98-a-0066 590.328875 599.460000 [silence]
