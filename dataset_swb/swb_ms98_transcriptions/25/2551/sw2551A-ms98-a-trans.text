sw2551A-ms98-a-0017 144.925625 152.973500 it gets really difficult to find someone in fact now i'm donating it to a local church

sw2551A-ms98-a-0055 288.002750 299.143750 uh it we are in an open rural community and we find more garbage on the roadsides when it starts costing people they simply take a bag and pitch
sw2551A-ms98-a-0056 299.143750 313.876875 pitch it into a ditch someplace uh my [vocalized-noise] my biggest concern or one of my biggest concerns is is the tires what they're going to ever do with used tires my husband uh recently retired after thirty two years in a service station and of course
sw2551A-ms98-a-0057 313.876875 328.117500 originally it was no big deal you could get rid of them but now there's just simply no way to get rid of these things and you see more and more of that around about the country where people have have thrown a tire in the ditch or two tires in the ditch and

sw2551A-ms98-a-0075 430.083000 444.869375 uh at one time uh not too long ago uh farmers could use uh tires to start a fire burning fence rows which of course was an air pollutant and they've put a stop to any open burning of any kind and they are fining
sw2551A-ms98-a-0076 444.869375 456.525000 people now i mean it used to be the law was and no one enforced it but they are enforcing it now and and i'm glad they are however one solution presents another problem
