sw2574B-ms98-a-0003 2.924375 10.920125 i personally feel like as long as the Soviet Union exists it's going to be a threat to the United States and
sw2574B-ms98-a-0004 10.920125 13.180375 [silence]
sw2574B-ms98-a-0005 13.180375 15.259000 that's right and i
sw2574B-ms98-a-0006 15.259000 22.630000 i think that we've made a lot of strides in the last several years with them but i don't feel like that we can ever turn our back on them and
sw2574B-ms98-a-0007 22.630000 24.949500 no i- i just think that
sw2574B-ms98-a-0008 24.949500 28.629250 [silence]
sw2574B-ms98-a-0009 28.629250 30.049500 yeah
sw2574B-ms98-a-0010 30.049500 33.379625 [silence]
sw2574B-ms98-a-0011 33.379625 37.808125 and i i have to wonder sometimes how much of their dependence is
sw2574B-ms98-a-0012 37.808125 45.197625 um you know if it's if uh sort of a false dependence just to while they're building their own 
sw2574B-ms98-a-0013 45.197625 53.351625 uh way of doing things that they're making us think that they depend that much on us so that we don't watch them more closely
sw2574B-ms98-a-0014 53.351625 56.045625 you know i'm very suspicious of them
sw2574B-ms98-a-0015 56.045625 57.857875 [laughter]
sw2574B-ms98-a-0016 57.857875 59.209625 [silence]

sw2574B-ms98-a-0020 64.916250 83.628625 [silence]
sw2574B-ms98-a-0021 83.628625 85.240875 that's right
sw2574B-ms98-a-0022 85.240875 87.025375 [silence]
sw2574B-ms98-a-0023 87.025375 92.659375 and i don't kn[ow]- you know they they want to know what it would take to convince us that they aren't a threat
sw2574B-ms98-a-0024 92.659375 97.589125 and i don't know that there's anything that can be done to convince us of that because
sw2574B-ms98-a-0025 97.589125 106.748625 you know we just see how i[f]- if you let your guard down in any situation how you know how quickly that Persian Gulf situation arose
sw2574B-ms98-a-0026 106.748625 108.709500 um i don't
sw2574B-ms98-a-0027 108.709500 116.773875 i- i don't think that that we can ever be convinced as a country that that they're going to change or you know not be a threat
sw2574B-ms98-a-0028 116.773875 118.620625 [silence]
sw2574B-ms98-a-0029 118.620625 125.373875 yeah and even even the strides that were made toward that though uh you know Gorbachev seems to have
sw2574B-ms98-a-0030 125.373875 130.986750 he seems to have lost his steam in in that direction and
sw2574B-ms98-a-0031 130.986750 135.913750 you know he seems to be repressing his own people again and i don't think that
sw2574B-ms98-a-0032 135.913750 138.004125 i think that a lot of the
sw2574B-ms98-a-0033 138.004125 144.029875 the forward progress that was made came to a halt you know in the middle of that Persian [Grulf/Gulf] Gulf crisis
sw2574B-ms98-a-0034 144.029875 153.754125 [silence]
sw2574B-ms98-a-0035 153.754125 160.060500 yeah see so m[any]- many of them have gotten a taste of of democracy and 
sw2574B-ms98-a-0036 160.060500 160.865250 [noise]
sw2574B-ms98-a-0037 160.865250 164.044875 they're kind of in between right now they're they're not
sw2574B-ms98-a-0038 164.044875 175.619875 uh they're not getting the benefits of being a democratic place but they they know what they are and uh the country tells them that you know this is what it's like to be a democracy and they're still hurting
sw2574B-ms98-a-0039 175.619875 180.477875 so you know they're getting i guess the worst of all worlds right now
sw2574B-ms98-a-0040 180.477875 193.757000 [silence]
sw2574B-ms98-a-0041 193.757000 195.063375 [laughter-uh]
