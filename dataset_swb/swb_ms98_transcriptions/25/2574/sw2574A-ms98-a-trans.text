sw2574A-ms98-a-0014 69.659375 79.334375 i think i think they're in pretty bad shape right now i i think their i think their reliance on us is is probably real
sw2574A-ms98-a-0015 79.334375 84.754500 course that's not to say that once we get them on their feet again things won't go back the way they [laughter-were]

sw2574A-ms98-a-0036 180.648375 185.329125 well there was a interesting cartoon in the editorial the other day it was a
sw2574A-ms98-a-0037 185.329125 194.811875 there was a picture of a shop keeper with this really mean look on his face and empty shelves in back of him and a little rat and a couple of spider webs and
sw2574A-ms98-a-0038 194.811875 201.212250 couple of Russians walk in and look at it and say well we have the worst of both worlds communism and capitalism

sw2574A-ms98-a-0040 204.158250 217.130125 but you know i i i think that i think or at least i hope tha[t]- they understood that's what was going to happen now you can't go from a a communist economy to a democratic one and expect things to be great overnight
sw2574A-ms98-a-0041 217.130125 219.198125 it's just like Poland
sw2574A-ms98-a-0042 219.198125 225.839875 and East Germany i mean the the only saving grace for East Germany is that West Germany had lots of money
sw2574A-ms98-a-0043 225.839875 232.425375 and uh they're bailing them out on everything but even even now the West Germans are grumbling
sw2574A-ms98-a-0044 232.425375 234.880250 you know which i
sw2574A-ms98-a-0045 234.880250 246.480125 i would hope they had thought about that while they were busily engaged in tearing down the wall i mean they talk about unification unification and now they're unified and now all they can do is gripe [laughter]
sw2574A-ms98-a-0046 246.480125 247.747625 [laughter-but]

sw2574A-ms98-a-0059 292.097500 296.177750 um we can only hope that that continues
sw2574A-ms98-a-0060 296.177750 299.432125 it's a precursor of things to come
