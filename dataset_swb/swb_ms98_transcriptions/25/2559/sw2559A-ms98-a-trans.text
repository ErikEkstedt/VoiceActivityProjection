sw2559A-ms98-a-0002 1.342125 9.718875 well on this subject of invasion of privacy yes it's very easy for anybody to find out about you
sw2559A-ms98-a-0003 9.718875 11.061750 your
sw2559A-ms98-a-0004 11.061750 12.465250 [silence]
sw2559A-ms98-a-0005 12.465250 25.739875 yeah uh the special on channel thirteen that was broadcast i think last week or so ago it detailed how this one person went about
sw2559A-ms98-a-0006 25.739875 35.686625 finding out this particular pers[on]- from this particular person his home mortgage how much he pays for it what his payments are
sw2559A-ms98-a-0007 35.686625 46.468125 uh his uh social security number driver's license any kind of records he may have uh their credit card and the status of their credit
sw2559A-ms98-a-0008 46.468125 49.546125 [silence]
sw2559A-ms98-a-0009 49.546125 52.256750 it was just as a demonstration to show
sw2559A-ms98-a-0010 52.256750 59.920375 those who were watching it how easily obtainable information is on any single person
sw2559A-ms98-a-0011 59.920375 66.540125 and it was mostly it dealt with uh marketing companies these uh direct marketing
sw2559A-ms98-a-0012 66.540125 75.208875 associations that was the primary subject that's how they obtain information about segments of society
sw2559A-ms98-a-0013 75.208875 83.877625 and group them into age brackets uh their habits their hobbies their income
sw2559A-ms98-a-0014 83.877625 89.411375 and they're able to do that through all the manipulations of the computer
sw2559A-ms98-a-0015 89.411375 102.814125 [silence]
sw2559A-ms98-a-0016 102.814125 104.310250 um-hum

sw2559A-ms98-a-0021 120.423875 129.227000 [silence]
sw2559A-ms98-a-0022 129.227000 137.320750 not insofar as maybe making conversation with somebody i s[uppose]- suppose because it you can easily be overheard overheard
sw2559A-ms98-a-0023 137.320750 145.325125 and they get i suppose any items that you have laying out can be easily seen
sw2559A-ms98-a-0024 145.325125 146.495000 [silence]
sw2559A-ms98-a-0025 146.495000 149.016750 yeah there's there is

sw2559A-ms98-a-0031 175.514500 180.449375 do you work with uh mixed company male and female or
sw2559A-ms98-a-0032 180.449375 182.657500 [silence]
sw2559A-ms98-a-0033 182.657500 186.395250 well there there are a few out there
sw2559A-ms98-a-0034 186.395250 190.731250 it's i suppose it depends on who you're working for and where at
sw2559A-ms98-a-0035 190.731250 192.015750 [silence]
sw2559A-ms98-a-0036 192.015750 193.560250 but um
sw2559A-ms98-a-0037 193.560250 195.286125 [silence]
sw2559A-ms98-a-0038 195.286125 200.092375 my own environment is open totally there are no cubicles
sw2559A-ms98-a-0039 200.092375 202.718500 there's nothing to block anything
sw2559A-ms98-a-0040 202.718500 203.871500 [silence]
sw2559A-ms98-a-0041 203.871500 216.464000 so yeah but um i guess we're changing ever so rapidly in the devices of
sw2559A-ms98-a-0042 216.464000 224.919625 communications that anything can be obtained from anybody's record or
sw2559A-ms98-a-0043 224.919625 228.616625 the computer is the
sw2559A-ms98-a-0044 228.616625 242.477375 the big advent of that i believe because it they can all hold such large data bases on anybody that all you have to do is touch a button and it appears
sw2559A-ms98-a-0045 242.477375 255.126000 in front of them and you don't have to i- i know the government sells information to private companies about individuals or families
sw2559A-ms98-a-0046 255.126000 260.405625 that's no secret and it shouldn't be that way i don't think
sw2559A-ms98-a-0047 260.405625 265.352250 i mean it's not really government for the people and by the people i'll tell you that
sw2559A-ms98-a-0048 265.352250 267.788250 [silence]
sw2559A-ms98-a-0049 267.788250 269.432500 so
sw2559A-ms98-a-0050 269.432500 272.124625 [silence]
sw2559A-ms98-a-0051 272.124625 275.517375 uh the only way it can change is um
sw2559A-ms98-a-0052 275.517375 282.774750 if if everybody bands together it's just like we need to get rid of these clowns that's serving in the office
sw2559A-ms98-a-0053 282.774750 291.321000 the only thing really that can be changed is for us to everybody to say we've had enough of you out you go but
sw2559A-ms98-a-0054 291.321000 306.022000 uh i don't see anything like that to occur unless everybody bands together to do that it has to be one common ideal goal for that to be done um
sw2559A-ms98-a-0055 306.022000 317.930000 i don't know it's it's still a a free i suppose country insofar as we're we're able to
sw2559A-ms98-a-0056 317.930000 324.925375 obtain information and i wouldn't be for total banning of
sw2559A-ms98-a-0057 324.925375 334.868500 uh all information or it's mostly the private information that we're all concerned about but it's it's hard to define
sw2559A-ms98-a-0058 334.868500 338.134125 uh a lot of those boundaries
sw2559A-ms98-a-0059 338.134125 343.201625 [silence]
sw2559A-ms98-a-0060 343.201625 344.692750 uh-huh
