sw2559B-ms98-a-0012 103.141125 114.671000 something that i feel is a is a pretty much an invasion of privacy is something that's really so common that it's accepted as the norm now is the op[en]- the open office concept
sw2559B-ms98-a-0013 114.671000 129.276250 uh-huh where they have the you know the little partition dividers throughout a a large room and and people have little cubicles well that's all fine and good but you don't really have any privacy at all

sw2559B-ms98-a-0020 157.050875 159.201250 because um

sw2559B-ms98-a-0049 341.300875 344.191750 a dealing with is like a credit bureau
sw2559B-ms98-a-0050 344.191750 352.507125 well they take they take my name which is a very common name and my last name is even more common
sw2559B-ms98-a-0051 352.507125 360.213625 and they they check that name against uh their list and they find several
sw2559B-ms98-a-0052 360.213625 367.666750 and without even bothering to try to match up any other information at all they just report everything under that name
sw2559B-ms98-a-0053 367.666750 369.053250 [silence]
sw2559B-ms98-a-0054 369.053250 372.935500 they don't they don't even check my social security number
sw2559B-ms98-a-0055 372.935500 374.067875 [silence]
sw2559B-ms98-a-0056 374.067875 383.419250 and companies are paying them good money to report accurately and they're not they're so lazy they're just not doing it i mean they just find your name and they match it up
sw2559B-ms98-a-0057 383.419250 393.117375 you know and that that just drives me crazy because they're and then they want then you know to get it removed they say well you know you have to write this 
sw2559B-ms98-a-0058 393.117375 400.628625 write this long detailed letter and everything like that to them you know and then it takes three weeks and all and i'm like baloney
sw2559B-ms98-a-0059 400.628625 403.069625 you messed it up you fix it
sw2559B-ms98-a-0060 403.069625 407.742875 [silence]
sw2559B-ms98-a-0061 407.742875 412.929250 no what i've taken to doing lately is calling the company that they report
sw2559B-ms98-a-0062 412.929250 419.069750 like uh uh recently i was reported as having JC Penney accounts and i don't
sw2559B-ms98-a-0063 419.069750 428.213625 so i called JC Penney and i said uh i just wanted to let you know that the credit agency you're using is incorrectly reporting the information that you're providing to them
sw2559B-ms98-a-0064 428.213625 437.013750 and they say uh-huh because_1 they really don't want to pay for services that's not being done properly either so then they can call
sw2559B-ms98-a-0065 437.013750 445.490000 the credit bureau and say hey you know we're paying you good money to report this properly and you're not doing your job
sw2559B-ms98-a-0066 445.490000 450.414375 so that's what i've taken to doing lately and it seems to work pretty well so far
