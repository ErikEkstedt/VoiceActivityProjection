sw2549A-ms98-a-0013 45.205750 55.792375 [noise]
sw2549A-ms98-a-0014 55.792375 56.845875 yeah
sw2549A-ms98-a-0015 56.845875 60.548125 [noise]
sw2549A-ms98-a-0016 60.548125 64.050875 oh okay so you were out there in San Francisco
sw2549A-ms98-a-0017 64.050875 65.429875 [noise]
sw2549A-ms98-a-0018 65.429875 66.684875 oh yeah
sw2549A-ms98-a-0019 66.684875 67.925250 oh
sw2549A-ms98-a-0020 67.925250 79.449125 yeah it's um um other than the uh the big catch uh with the 49ers and the Cowboys [laughter-ba[ck]]- back a few years ago i like San Francisco
sw2549A-ms98-a-0021 79.449125 87.714375 but uh i- i don't know i- i never really was a Cowboys fan until i moved down to Texas yeah i'm i'm in Dallas
sw2549A-ms98-a-0022 87.714375 101.848375 and uh uh i guess when you're down here in Dallas you finally get indoctrinated into the Cowboys um because_1 uh you know this is a big football territory down here and uh uh
sw2549A-ms98-a-0023 101.848375 115.740875 unfortunately of course the Cowboys have been doing so bad in the past few years that uh uh i don't know everybody's kind of uh they're still behind them_1 but uh it's not like it used to be
sw2549A-ms98-a-0024 115.740875 121.154625 [silence]
sw2549A-ms98-a-0025 121.154625 133.866250 that's right [laughter] but i think uh actually uh in in trying to follow uh you know the Cowboys over the years i think uh uh they used to have a um
sw2549A-ms98-a-0026 133.866250 147.067250 a philosophy for oh i don't know probably the last you know twenty five years except for the last about five or six years uh they always went out and tried to draft the the best um athletes
sw2549A-ms98-a-0027 147.067250 160.472750 and didn't really put them_1 draft for any particular spot but they would go out and try to go for uh the best people and then mold them into different areas or find their natural niche
sw2549A-ms98-a-0028 160.472750 169.528000 and then about five years ago four or five years ago uh they started going after uh uh specific players or positions
sw2549A-ms98-a-0029 169.528000 179.961750 you know like the press would get down on Landry and this is when Schramm was still there and um they'd go after them saying uh jeez what you really need is a defensive end
sw2549A-ms98-a-0030 179.961750 191.535375 and so they'd go out and try to find a defensive end when they when they drafted somebody and he didn't workout at that spot it really wasn't a good enough athlete to move to any place else
sw2549A-ms98-a-0031 191.535375 203.406750 and uh so i think it was kind of interesting uh i think the decline of the uh of the Cowboys as a powerhouse really kind of started with uh not drafting people the best athletes
sw2549A-ms98-a-0032 203.406750 210.163375 [silence]
sw2549A-ms98-a-0033 210.163375 212.553750 yeah yeah

sw2549A-ms98-a-0037 222.287375 231.285125 [silence]
sw2549A-ms98-a-0038 231.285125 241.791125 uh they still have some some uh some draft picks uh that they got no ac[tually]- actually they picked up some from Minnesota
sw2549A-ms98-a-0039 241.791125 248.484250 i think it was uh Minnesota's run yeah
sw2549A-ms98-a-0040 248.484250 251.082875 they traded Walker yeah [laughter]
sw2549A-ms98-a-0041 251.082875 253.775375 [silence]
sw2549A-ms98-a-0042 253.775375 260.721750 uh that's okay they um um i've got a friend that uh lives right next to the Cowboys' training camp
sw2549A-ms98-a-0043 260.721750 275.142875 and uh uh he gets he sees them out running a lot and every once in a while gets a chance to talk to some of the guys and they're all uh they're all thinking that uh man they they they really got something going this year
sw2549A-ms98-a-0044 275.142875 284.043000 but i- i guess uh when you have a whole bunch of uh professional athletes that get together at the beginning of the year everybody's got great hopes
sw2549A-ms98-a-0045 284.043000 291.421250 you know i guess it's the same way with baseball or or anybody you know spring training until you actually start going out and getting
sw2549A-ms98-a-0046 291.421250 296.158000 uh getting out against the competition everything probably looks pretty good
