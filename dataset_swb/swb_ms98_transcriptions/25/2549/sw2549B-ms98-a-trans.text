sw2549B-ms98-a-0062 320.791625 324.181250 because they only won one game the year before right

sw2549B-ms98-a-0067 346.967375 361.564125 talking about how how they're going to get a baseball team and everything it's like you guys aren't going to get a baseball team i'm sorry it's not going to happen but of course you know the the one the griping is that if you know if if Washington doesn't get a uh a baseball team then Baltimore shouldn't get a football team
sw2549B-ms98-a-0068 361.564125 373.538375 which is probably true but anyway um i just i've never liked DC a whole lot and i really hate the Redskins and a lot of it's because_1 you know i got a lot of people you know at work with and everything that are big Redskin fans

sw2549B-ms98-a-0076 414.004875 421.831750 when uh la[st]- last i guess it was January when um Jimmy Johnson got named coach of the year or whatever
sw2549B-ms98-a-0077 421.831750 424.498625 it was the same day that Buddy Ryan got fired
sw2549B-ms98-a-0078 424.498625 433.219125 and uh he had this cartoon in there about Jimmy Johnson's big day you know the first thing is the phone call from the you know from the league saying he was uh um
sw2549B-ms98-a-0079 433.219125 440.758375 you know uh was coach of the year and the second was this phone call from Buddy Ryan i've got fired can you believe that [laughter]

sw2549B-ms98-a-0087 473.346750 475.549875 [silence]
sw2549B-ms98-a-0088 475.549875 483.317125 oh okay yeah that's not far from where the uh the new football stadium would be if we got an NFL team [laughter]
sw2549B-ms98-a-0089 483.317125 490.190375 yeah well they've they've built a new baseball stadium downtown um it's opening next year this little
sw2549B-ms98-a-0090 490.190375 494.505250 [silence]
sw2549B-ms98-a-0091 494.505250 496.052625 the Inner Harbor
sw2549B-ms98-a-0092 496.052625 500.565250 yeah it's um a couple of blocks west there's a big um
sw2549B-ms98-a-0093 500.565250 507.240375 there is an old railroad yard basically um there's a big long railroad shed and then there's uh an old station
sw2549B-ms98-a-0094 507.240375 520.037375 and they're building the stadium on the other side of the shed from the Inner Harbor which is really stupid because one of the big selling points of the new stadium is supposed to be this view of the Inner Harbor and the only way you're going to have a view of is this big brick wall [laughter] um
sw2549B-ms98-a-0095 520.037375 526.190500 but you know they're building the baseball stadium and they've got land set aside for a football stadium if they ever get an NFL team
sw2549B-ms98-a-0096 526.190500 537.360000 so it's um real easy access from from south of Baltimore like um you know like the airport or more importantly for the Orioles from Washington DC
sw2549B-ms98-a-0097 537.360000 543.736500 because the Orioles say they get twenty five percent of their population i mean uh their attendance from uh DC
