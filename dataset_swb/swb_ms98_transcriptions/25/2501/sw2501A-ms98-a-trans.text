sw2501A-ms98-a-0008 20.956750 22.613000 right
sw2501A-ms98-a-0009 22.613000 29.093750 [silence]
sw2501A-ms98-a-0010 29.093750 34.358625 yeah i know di[d]- is it easy to find pai[nters]- uh painters to do this for you
sw2501A-ms98-a-0011 34.358625 42.932000 [silence]
sw2501A-ms98-a-0012 42.932000 47.279500 right are you talking about outside or inside exterior yeah
sw2501A-ms98-a-0013 47.279500 50.394000 [silence]
sw2501A-ms98-a-0014 50.394000 51.687250 well
sw2501A-ms98-a-0015 51.687250 53.474500 yeah
sw2501A-ms98-a-0016 53.474500 56.304625 [noise] well when we've painted um [noise]
sw2501A-ms98-a-0017 56.304625 65.114625 right now our house doesn't have to have the same kind of exterior painting there [noise] it's more trim because it has [noise] some of the old asbestos shingles
sw2501A-ms98-a-0018 65.114625 71.642250 on the back and there's some sort of stone or something in the front so there isn't as much wood that has to be painted um
sw2501A-ms98-a-0019 71.642250 80.196000 [noise] but i[t]- it the problem is that it hits the sun hits it so preparing it is a real problem you've got to prepare it well or else it'll flake
sw2501A-ms98-a-0020 80.196000 81.556625 um
sw2501A-ms98-a-0021 81.556625 99.354750 [silence]
sw2501A-ms98-a-0022 99.354750 102.990625 wow that's quite a range
sw2501A-ms98-a-0023 102.990625 109.504375 [silence]
sw2501A-ms98-a-0024 109.504375 111.080250 yeah
sw2501A-ms98-a-0025 111.080250 117.554750 [laughter] yeah which might be a bigger problem than it would be uh yeah absolutely [noise]
sw2501A-ms98-a-0026 117.554750 120.129625 [silence]
sw2501A-ms98-a-0027 120.129625 123.618250 [noise] no we have uh done a little painting ourselves
sw2501A-ms98-a-0028 123.618250 132.818500 um we painted a bedroom uh well within the last couple of months um and we have we have some more that need to be done but the
sw2501A-ms98-a-0029 132.818500 138.359250 the problem that we we've owned this house almost five years now and [noise] um when we bought it
sw2501A-ms98-a-0030 138.359250 150.804250 [noise] the um it had been vacant for a while because the family had retired to Arizona but the daughter was a real estate agent and she was selling it and it'd been lived in briefly by her before she bought her town house [noise] so she told us that the house had been
sw2501A-ms98-a-0031 150.804250 158.424375 uh professionally painted recently and it looked pretty good you know the interior walls all basically white but they obviously had been done
sw2501A-ms98-a-0032 158.424375 172.399500 without to much uh wear afterward [noise] the only problem was when we started having the movers move the the uh furniture in we identified the various rooms by pieces of masking tape on the wood uh
sw2501A-ms98-a-0033 172.399500 177.677875 the door frames when we took the masking tape off half the painted came with it
sw2501A-ms98-a-0034 177.677875 190.672875 big long strips so what had happened is that professional painters had not prepared the surface properly and some of that still has to be redone
sw2501A-ms98-a-0035 190.672875 195.895500 [noise] yeah well no actually it had been uh it would had been a repaint job
sw2501A-ms98-a-0036 195.895500 207.040625 but they had not um either they had painted with the wrong kind of paint over top or they hadn't really roughed it up or whatever they woul[d]- because it was woodwork so it looked as if it had been painted
sw2501A-ms98-a-0037 207.040625 215.405500 correctly with you know uh an enamel or something but um it had not either that or it ha[d]- had not been prepared underneath and it was greasy or something
sw2501A-ms98-a-0038 215.405500 227.736625 it comes off in strips i mean not even little bit so we still have some of that trim work to do because we [laughter-put] [laughter-it] [laughter-off] [laughter-all] [laughter-this] [laughter-time] we know what a job it's gonna be because_1 you almost have to strip the whole thing in order do it again
sw2501A-ms98-a-0039 227.736625 231.729750 okay [laughter] thank you bye
sw2501A-ms98-a-0040 231.729750 233.457875 [noise]
