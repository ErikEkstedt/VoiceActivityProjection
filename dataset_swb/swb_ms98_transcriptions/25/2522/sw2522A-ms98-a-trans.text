sw2522A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.613250 [noise]
sw2522A-ms98-a-0002 0.613250 2.934875 okay uh
sw2522A-ms98-a-0003 2.934875 9.826250 i think maybe that we could do better with the budget if we didn't buy so much stuff overseas
sw2522A-ms98-a-0004 9.826250 15.447750 [silence]
sw2522A-ms98-a-0005 15.447750 19.800625 well then maybe they wouldn't have to take so many taxes out and stuff like that
sw2522A-ms98-a-0006 19.800625 21.404875 well
sw2522A-ms98-a-0007 21.404875 39.643875 [silence]
sw2522A-ms98-a-0008 39.643875 44.106875 well i agree i think that's what i'm trying to [laughter-say] 
sw2522A-ms98-a-0009 44.106875 51.265000 [silence]
sw2522A-ms98-a-0010 51.265000 54.236625 spend less
sw2522A-ms98-a-0011 54.236625 58.841750 i think we [vocalized-noise] well i think we give too much money away
sw2522A-ms98-a-0012 58.841750 61.639375 other countries yeah
sw2522A-ms98-a-0013 61.639375 68.718500 we don't ever get anything from anybody when we're having to fight to get money to help us with this war we were just in
sw2522A-ms98-a-0014 68.718500 70.353875 [silence]
sw2522A-ms98-a-0015 70.353875 74.160875 right well it's not true though we're not anymore
sw2522A-ms98-a-0016 74.160875 84.215625 [silence]
sw2522A-ms98-a-0017 84.215625 88.297375 we can't even take care of the people that are hungry and homeless here
sw2522A-ms98-a-0018 88.297375 90.392375 uh i mean
sw2522A-ms98-a-0019 90.392375 112.078750 [silence]
sw2522A-ms98-a-0020 112.078750 116.459250 but see r[ight]- right now we're having a hard time finding people jobs
sw2522A-ms98-a-0021 116.459250 129.734500 if you're a TI worker you how well you know are you are you a TI worker yeah so am i [noise] so we know you know that times are really tough right now and yet we're still sending money here and there i just know it
sw2522A-ms98-a-0022 129.734500 132.661000 you know it's just crazy
sw2522A-ms98-a-0023 132.661000 138.657875 and more and more people without i have several friends without jobs now that in this last riff
sw2522A-ms98-a-0024 138.657875 144.306125 went out looking for jobs and jobs are really hard to come by now really hard to come by
sw2522A-ms98-a-0025 144.306125 145.480500 [silence]
sw2522A-ms98-a-0026 145.480500 147.427500 and that's scary
sw2522A-ms98-a-0027 147.427500 149.674125 [silence]
sw2522A-ms98-a-0028 149.674125 151.233000 that's right
sw2522A-ms98-a-0029 151.233000 154.348250 it's already happened to me once but i was lucky
sw2522A-ms98-a-0030 154.348250 159.991625 and i got to stay in TI but you know not everybody's that lucky anymore
sw2522A-ms98-a-0031 159.991625 164.384125 and they're and i don't know the welfare system is just so abused 
sw2522A-ms98-a-0032 164.384125 189.574375 [silence]
sw2522A-ms98-a-0033 189.574375 195.839125 well i know but then okay but that's here but then other countries are doing it to us
sw2522A-ms98-a-0034 195.839125 203.795500 their when their people are hungry and all they're asking us for handouts so why shouldn't our own people be able to ask for a handout
sw2522A-ms98-a-0035 203.795500 214.088250 i mean i think we should take care of our own things right here in our own country and then if we have anything left over to share with other countries then maybe we should consider sharing
sw2522A-ms98-a-0036 214.088250 223.589000 but i just don't i think we're and then they keep raising the taxes boy i'll tell you what i barely make ends meet and they raise taxes and
sw2522A-ms98-a-0037 223.589000 227.987625 wages aren't going up that [laughter-much] and it's hard
sw2522A-ms98-a-0038 227.987625 239.441500 i mean you know especially if you're alone it's on one salary it's terribly hard to pay the bills and pay your house payment and a car payment and insurance is ridiculous
sw2522A-ms98-a-0039 239.441500 241.540625 you know [noise] and
sw2522A-ms98-a-0040 241.540625 251.246875 [silence]
sw2522A-ms98-a-0041 251.246875 253.615875 not very much
sw2522A-ms98-a-0042 253.615875 255.150750 they
sw2522A-ms98-a-0043 255.150750 257.570500 [silence]
sw2522A-ms98-a-0044 257.570500 262.014000 yep it's hard it's really hard i
sw2522A-ms98-a-0045 262.014000 266.488250 well uh no i don't know i guess if we had the answers we'd
sw2522A-ms98-a-0046 266.488250 269.051000 we could save the country but
sw2522A-ms98-a-0047 269.051000 274.816500 yeah [laughter] well they all say great things when they run for office
sw2522A-ms98-a-0048 274.816500 315.273625 [silence]
sw2522A-ms98-a-0049 315.273625 317.611375 yeah i know that
sw2522A-ms98-a-0050 317.611375 326.502750 you know and then they cut their defense i- i'm not sure if that was such a great idea that cut us really [laughter-bad] [laughter-i] just i hated to see that
sw2522A-ms98-a-0051 326.502750 363.159375 [silence]
sw2522A-ms98-a-0052 363.159375 371.380375 well yeah yeah i do but i still hated to see it [laughter] i mean one of the reasons i voted for Bush was because
sw2522A-ms98-a-0053 371.380375 382.532375 Reagan was so defense conscious and we were doing so well and i thought well Bush is going to just carry right on [laughter] he didn't [laughter] was i [laughter-surprised] i uh
sw2522A-ms98-a-0054 382.532375 384.463250 [silence]
sw2522A-ms98-a-0055 384.463250 387.215500 well i don't know
sw2522A-ms98-a-0056 387.215500 396.360750 [silence]
sw2522A-ms98-a-0057 396.360750 407.865750 [noise] but those are things that we we really need i hate to see the old people that don't have anybody and h[ey]- you know there are [noise] people out there that have no family or and they really depend on their Medicare
sw2522A-ms98-a-0058 407.865750 414.030875 and their Social Security and maybe they're in a nursing home somewhere and they cut some of this stuff and what happens to them
sw2522A-ms98-a-0059 414.030875 416.950125 [silence]
sw2522A-ms98-a-0060 416.950125 419.228500 yeah [laughter]
sw2522A-ms98-a-0061 419.228500 428.553875 [silence]
sw2522A-ms98-a-0062 428.553875 430.772625 so what's the answer
sw2522A-ms98-a-0063 430.772625 433.683875 [noise]
sw2522A-ms98-a-0064 433.683875 444.925375 [silence]

sw2522A-ms98-a-0068 456.904375 458.036750 but
sw2522A-ms98-a-0069 458.036750 460.081500 [silence]

sw2522A-ms98-a-0071 464.506500 465.709000 [silence]
sw2522A-ms98-a-0072 465.709000 467.183625 in the state
sw2522A-ms98-a-0073 467.183625 468.899375 or the country
sw2522A-ms98-a-0074 468.899375 471.446375 [silence]

sw2522A-ms98-a-0080 502.358000 504.256000 [silence]
sw2522A-ms98-a-0081 504.256000 506.550375 well then that's not the answer
sw2522A-ms98-a-0082 506.550375 507.836125 [silence]
sw2522A-ms98-a-0083 507.836125 509.149250 yeah
sw2522A-ms98-a-0084 509.149250 512.474250 [silence]

sw2522A-ms98-a-0089 528.563000 538.009000 [silence]
sw2522A-ms98-a-0090 538.009000 546.198625 and the other thing that concerns me terribly is automobile insurance now i don't know how much longer i'm going to be able to afford it at all
sw2522A-ms98-a-0091 546.198625 551.664875 it's eating me alive because i- i might be almost fifty but i'm single
sw2522A-ms98-a-0092 551.664875 561.980750 and [laughter-i] [laughter-don't] [laughter-think] and this company's that just becau[se]- and i own my own home and i have a garage [laughter] and because i'm single there's companies that won't take me no matter how old you are
sw2522A-ms98-a-0093 561.980750 570.541500 they won't take you because they say you're a risk you go out and party i said i don't even drink i mean i don't even go out but they won't take you i mean i was turned down this year

sw2522A-ms98-a-0095 584.035250 592.285625 [silence]
sw2522A-ms98-a-0096 592.285625 595.452625 but yet they're not helping us with the companies
