sw2522B-ms98-a-0018 65.656750 67.617875 that's because_1
sw2522B-ms98-a-0019 67.617875 71.236500 we're supposed to be the rich ones with all the money to give away
sw2522B-ms98-a-0020 71.236500 73.815750 [silence]
sw2522B-ms98-a-0021 73.815750 78.639375 [vocalized-noise] we're s[till]- we are still the biggest ones

sw2522B-ms98-a-0024 87.814125 97.138000 yeah that's that's an important thing we've got we've got a lot of people who are getting money the from the government for this that and the other thing
sw2522B-ms98-a-0025 97.138000 104.118750 and uh it would probably help if we could figure out how to get them to put money back into the system instead you know
sw2522B-ms98-a-0026 104.118750 112.181000 you take someone on welfare and you give them a job and they're paying income taxes all of a sudden you've changed it around and it's going in the other direction

sw2522B-ms98-a-0048 169.889250 173.519125 i think the problem is is just the government is trying to do too much
sw2522B-ms98-a-0049 173.519125 181.383375 um i mean who where does it say that the government's supposed to be the one to take care of all of the people that are homeless or hungry or et cetera et cetera
sw2522B-ms98-a-0050 181.383375 188.735875 and and where does it say that that if someone is short that they can go to the government and and get a handout

sw2522B-ms98-a-0069 240.520750 254.105750 you know i think you know i've got a fairly decent job here at TI but uh when i think of y[ou]- you go to the the grocery store and you see someone working as a cashier and you think y[ou]- you know how much a cashier makes and you go how do these people get by
sw2522B-ms98-a-0070 254.105750 256.854250 because i know how hard it is for me to get by

sw2522B-ms98-a-0077 272.702125 273.927000 um-hum
sw2522B-ms98-a-0078 273.927000 279.125875 well the thing is um you know who's really in charge of deciding how the money gets spent
sw2522B-ms98-a-0079 279.125875 287.259750 and and it's you know it's not the president the president just suggests it the ones who actually you know debate it and decide it is the is the Congress
sw2522B-ms98-a-0080 287.259750 290.152625 and you know what the Congress is out for they're
sw2522B-ms98-a-0081 290.152625 298.008625 they're going to do whatever it takes to make their voters happy which means bring more jobs and more federal spending to their little area
sw2522B-ms98-a-0082 298.008625 300.015875 and uh
sw2522B-ms98-a-0083 300.015875 310.659250 uh and that means every Congressman is sitting there working for money going to his area nobody's working on less money going to his area or on anybody else's area
sw2522B-ms98-a-0084 310.659250 315.400250 and if you just if you just looked at how much Congress spends on itself it's ridiculous
sw2522B-ms98-a-0085 315.400250 323.785250 [silence]
sw2522B-ms98-a-0086 323.785250 325.563500 [laughter]
sw2522B-ms98-a-0087 325.563500 327.470000 well now the thing is
sw2522B-ms98-a-0088 327.470000 340.876625 yeah they're cutting defense which is you know there are people out there working for defense contractors who are losing money but i d[on't]- i don't mind because i think you know government is not there to give me a job Government
sw2522B-ms98-a-0089 340.876625 351.565375 the defense is there to defend our country and they do it for whatever you know they spend whatever money they need to to do that but i don't want them to to break the budget just so that i can have a job
sw2522B-ms98-a-0090 351.565375 355.125500 [noise] i would rather have the the government stable
sw2522B-ms98-a-0091 355.125500 361.606375 so that i can go get a good job with someone who's not work[ing]- you know not making defense stuff

sw2522B-ms98-a-0093 363.387250 365.281875 if you know what i mean

sw2522B-ms98-a-0102 386.651000 394.962000 but but defense is not the biggest part of the federal budget either the biggest part of the budget are things like Medicare and Social Security

sw2522B-ms98-a-0115 417.774250 424.439500 well just think the federal government's insurance bill has Medicare and that's been going through the roof
sw2522B-ms98-a-0116 424.439500 429.447500 and that's why f[ederal]- you know that's that's the biggest increase in federal spending right there
sw2522B-ms98-a-0117 429.447500 431.689000 [silence]
sw2522B-ms98-a-0118 431.689000 436.572125 think we need to figure out a way to uh to make medical care cheaper
sw2522B-ms98-a-0119 436.572125 441.771250 why is this stuff so expensive why is the cost going up so incredibly fast

sw2522B-ms98-a-0121 442.780375 448.285625 you know because_1 it's it's coming out of my paycheck it's coming out of your paycheck and it's coming out of our taxes too
sw2522B-ms98-a-0122 448.285625 451.853625 why why is these hospitals making so much money

sw2522B-ms98-a-0128 468.263875 471.920125 everybody in the count[ry]- like i- i lived in Denmark for a couple of years
sw2522B-ms98-a-0129 471.920125 481.027625 and medical care there is free you just go and say i want your help and they'll help you there's couple of things though first of all it's not
sw2522B-ms98-a-0130 481.027625 487.537000 as high a quality as we expect here because it's paid for by the government instead of by us
sw2522B-ms98-a-0131 487.537000 492.887375 and second um your taxes are a lot higher
sw2522B-ms98-a-0132 492.887375 496.740000 an awful lot higher we're talking fifty percent something like that
sw2522B-ms98-a-0133 496.740000 498.006125 [silence]
sw2522B-ms98-a-0134 498.006125 499.846750 they are paying for it
sw2522B-ms98-a-0135 499.846750 504.084125 and and the and the just the quality of care is not as good either
sw2522B-ms98-a-0136 504.084125 506.384875 [silence]
sw2522B-ms98-a-0137 506.384875 511.446625 there has got to be a middle ground i think Canada's got a good answer but i don't know many details about it

sw2522B-ms98-a-0139 514.016375 520.235250 it's it's some sort of government program i've heard a lot of people say good things about it but i just don't know the details on it

sw2522B-ms98-a-0141 527.174125 533.530125 well something's going to have to change but you look at the Congress and you look how many of them_1 get reelected and they're the one's that have got to make the changes
sw2522B-ms98-a-0142 533.530125 537.692000 i mean i don't see anything changing because you've got the same old people in there
