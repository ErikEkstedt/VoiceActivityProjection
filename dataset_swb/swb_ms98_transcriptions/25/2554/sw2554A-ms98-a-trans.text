sw2554A-ms98-a-0018 57.145375 67.544125 well you know the funny thing i find about American opinion is that when we have gone in to destabilize a government before the American public goes crazy
sw2554A-ms98-a-0019 67.544125 79.562500 and now the fact that we're not interfering with the internal rebellion in in Iraq they're going crazy [laughter-you] [laughter-know] i mean you can't please them_1 one way or the other
sw2554A-ms98-a-0020 79.562500 87.100625 you know and i and i think that i- i agree with you this is exactly the right course i mean that's an internal problem to Iraq it has nothing to do with us
sw2554A-ms98-a-0021 87.100625 87.468250 [noise]
sw2554A-ms98-a-0022 87.468250 94.402500 and until he starts doing something so inhumane that the UN gets involved then it's nobody's business
sw2554A-ms98-a-0023 94.402500 95.759000 um
sw2554A-ms98-a-0024 95.759000 97.501375 [silence]
sw2554A-ms98-a-0025 97.501375 100.425125 all the time i mean yeah i mean

sw2554A-ms98-a-0028 103.525125 116.399500 yeah and it's certainly and it's certainly been going on over there for hundreds of years and it's going to continue as long as you have so many diverse groups that are that are vying for power it's going to happen all the time
sw2554A-ms98-a-0029 116.399500 124.400000 i mean the Kurds have tried it before they've gotten their butts kicked and this is just another time that it's happening
sw2554A-ms98-a-0030 124.400000 130.478125 you know an[d]- they'll regroup out in the mountains and they'll try it again in a couple of years

sw2554A-ms98-a-0032 132.859125 138.398375 sure and and and i don't have any doubt that through some back channels that we encouraged it
sw2554A-ms98-a-0033 138.398375 138.554500 [noise]
sw2554A-ms98-a-0034 138.554500 139.730625 you know
sw2554A-ms98-a-0035 139.730625 143.985625 but i i'm not real sure that we promised them anything
sw2554A-ms98-a-0036 143.985625 152.065125 i that would have been stupid and i do[n't]- and i don't think we did it everything else we handled in this seemed to be perfectly right i don't think they would have done that
sw2554A-ms98-a-0037 152.065125 153.547250 but
sw2554A-ms98-a-0038 153.547250 161.016125 it just it it really doesn't make any difference this is just a ch[apter]- a another chapter in Middle Eastern history
sw2554A-ms98-a-0039 161.016125 163.929625 [silence]
sw2554A-ms98-a-0040 163.929625 176.333500 oh sure i mean the the British occupied the place the French occupied it we've done it ah it it's happened so many times this is this is really nothing special uh
sw2554A-ms98-a-0041 176.333500 183.652500 [silence]
sw2554A-ms98-a-0042 183.652500 187.276500 that's right it's all it's mostly religious anyway

sw2554A-ms98-a-0048 200.058500 207.166250 well i- i- i think one of the big problems i mean looking at it from the Am[erican]- the American public's standpoints they don't understand the Middle Easterners
sw2554A-ms98-a-0049 207.166250 214.280000 they don't understand what i mean their politics really isn't politics it's religion couched as politics
sw2554A-ms98-a-0050 214.280000 216.430250 and there's a big difference
sw2554A-ms98-a-0051 216.430250 221.860000 you know uh we sit there and and we think that they think the way we think
sw2554A-ms98-a-0052 221.860000 225.053500 and that's a big mistake because_1 they don't [laughter]

sw2554A-ms98-a-0060 241.102250 248.405625 tha[t's]- that's that's it a lot of the time i- i was stationed in in Turkey for for a year and a half
sw2554A-ms98-a-0061 248.405625 253.688500 and it it was tough under[standing]- [laughter-understanding] those folks
sw2554A-ms98-a-0062 253.688500 259.262000 you know uh they uh they're uh they're so completely different culturally and socially and
sw2554A-ms98-a-0063 259.262000 265.315875 and religiously it's just it was very strange it was very interesting

sw2554A-ms98-a-0065 270.076125 277.463750 now i shoot i- i think some of these people that they claim as Middle Eastern experts don't don't have a clue sometimes
sw2554A-ms98-a-0066 277.463750 285.398875 you know they they sit there and and read their books and then proclaim themselves an expert well i'm not real sure that's that's appropriate

sw2554A-ms98-a-0070 292.391000 298.404875 well i sort that sort of goes to my pet peeve about the education system in [laughter-this] country too
sw2554A-ms98-a-0071 298.404875 301.429125 and we make experts by reading books you know
sw2554A-ms98-a-0072 301.429125 306.754375 and the Japanese and the Germans and everybody else make experts by doing
sw2554A-ms98-a-0073 306.754375 308.319500 yeah
sw2554A-ms98-a-0074 308.319500 309.582000 yeah

sw2554A-ms98-a-0076 311.114750 314.862625 i- i guess you work for TI yeah
sw2554A-ms98-a-0077 314.862625 320.782500 so you guys are well aware of the problems with the Japanese markets and everything else

sw2554A-ms98-a-0079 321.879750 322.863875 yeah
sw2554A-ms98-a-0080 322.863875 330.042250 it's it's like our car industry the only reason our car industry hasn't gone down the tubes is because_1 the Japanese
sw2554A-ms98-a-0081 330.042250 333.433625 you know came into it and helped us out
sw2554A-ms98-a-0082 333.433625 334.488875 [laughter]

sw2554A-ms98-a-0087 347.254125 352.368500 yeah and until we until we start changing our educational system i mean
sw2554A-ms98-a-0088 352.368500 364.461500 we're we're going to be we're we've already been overtaken but it's going to get even worse later i mean looks who's looks who's getting the engineering degrees and the the math and the science and everything it's not us
sw2554A-ms98-a-0089 364.461500 369.282000 you know we we've got folks running around here who get who get degrees in basket weaving and
sw2554A-ms98-a-0090 369.282000 374.666750 you know underwater psychology or some some ridiculous stuff like that
sw2554A-ms98-a-0091 374.666750 377.902375 and and where are the engineers coming from
sw2554A-ms98-a-0092 377.902375 381.053750 [silence]
sw2554A-ms98-a-0093 381.053750 382.997875 yeah exactly

sw2554A-ms98-a-0095 383.928625 396.271750 my uh my roommate is a uh he's getting his doctorate in industrial well it's not industrial engineering it's human factors his degree was in uh you know industrial engineering
sw2554A-ms98-a-0096 396.271750 397.486500 um
sw2554A-ms98-a-0097 397.486500 399.497750 and he's from the Philippines
sw2554A-ms98-a-0098 399.497750 406.337000 and the only reason he came here was because the education is m[uch]- so much better for those who will go after it
sw2554A-ms98-a-0099 406.337000 410.257125 he has no intention of going back to the Philippines because_1 there's no jobs
sw2554A-ms98-a-0100 410.257125 417.461125 you know uh but i- i see it all too often i mean we've got loads of foreign students
sw2554A-ms98-a-0101 417.461125 427.875500 and they're coming here going after the hard degrees and then they're going back to Korea and Japan and Hong Kong and everywhere else and they're applying it there
sw2554A-ms98-a-0102 427.875500 429.086000 and
sw2554A-ms98-a-0103 429.086000 429.777125 [laughter]
sw2554A-ms98-a-0104 429.777125 437.436750 i don't know it's to me it's amazing i don't know what we're going to do as a country we're we're going to become dependent on these other folks sooner or later

sw2554A-ms98-a-0109 449.590500 456.480000 i don't i don't think there can be anymore long range planning i think it it's it's sticking your finger in the holes and the dike
sw2554A-ms98-a-0110 456.480000 460.351875 you know uh oh here's a crisis well let's plug it up

sw2554A-ms98-a-0112 461.756750 465.052500 i don't know i don't know what the answer is it's far beyond me

sw2554A-ms98-a-0114 467.592250 470.075125 yeah all we can do is keep plugging
sw2554A-ms98-a-0115 470.075125 472.271875 you know i- i wonder i- i
sw2554A-ms98-a-0116 472.271875 477.131625 read in the paper just last week IBM's unveiling their new laptop computer
sw2554A-ms98-a-0117 477.131625 483.089250 well at a price tag of six thousand bucks i don't know if they're going to have a whole lot of takers
sw2554A-ms98-a-0118 483.089250 487.707875 be[cause]- uh now i have the i- i have the IBM PS two
sw2554A-ms98-a-0119 487.707875 489.680875 but i'm sorry i got it
sw2554A-ms98-a-0120 489.680875 496.925500 it's slow it's uh there are many better machines on the market right now for
sw2554A-ms98-a-0121 496.925500 507.040000 a the only reason i got it is because i got it through an educational purchase plan through the school and i saved forty eight percent so i said yeah if i can have an IBM for forty eight percent discount i'll take it
sw2554A-ms98-a-0122 507.040000 513.349250 but up to that point i had nev[er]- i had always said i would never have one because_1 i wouldn't pay that kind of money for their name
sw2554A-ms98-a-0123 513.349250 514.795125 but
sw2554A-ms98-a-0124 514.795125 522.867125 now you watch just sure as anything the Japanese are going to come out with a laptop at half the price with more stuff on it
sw2554A-ms98-a-0125 522.867125 529.282625 [silence]
sw2554A-ms98-a-0126 529.282625 531.595625 um-hum it's already outdated

sw2554A-ms98-a-0128 532.823125 535.335125 [silence]
sw2554A-ms98-a-0129 535.335125 538.292500 yeah yeah i- i can imagine
sw2554A-ms98-a-0130 538.292500 543.741250 i uh [noise] years ago i remember when i had a TI ninety nine
sw2554A-ms98-a-0131 543.741250 547.106375 put all the money into the expansion box and
sw2554A-ms98-a-0132 547.106375 549.524000 all this that and the other and
sw2554A-ms98-a-0133 549.524000 559.328250 uh things just kept changing so much and i kept getting rid of them_1 and i finally said well you can't do this [laughter] you've got to buy something and stick with it so i
sw2554A-ms98-a-0134 559.328250 570.544000 so i just at an opportune time i got one that that suited my needs and i've just stuck with it the only thing i've done to it is just add a uh add a mouse and a hard drive
sw2554A-ms98-a-0135 570.544000 577.594125 and that's all i plan to do of course i'm limited on memory now because i've got the low line i got the model twenty five
sw2554A-ms98-a-0136 577.594125 582.299375 so i'm stuck with six forty but i'm not a power user so it doesn't matter

sw2554A-ms98-a-0140 589.321750 593.052750 yeah now my roomie on the other hand he is a power user
sw2554A-ms98-a-0141 593.052750 593.252875 [noise]
sw2554A-ms98-a-0142 593.252875 600.275000 he's he's looking now to get rid of his he's got a three eighty six and wants to get a four eighty six you know this kind of stuff
