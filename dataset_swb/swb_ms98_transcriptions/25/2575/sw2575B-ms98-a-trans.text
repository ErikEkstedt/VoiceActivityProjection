sw2575B-ms98-a-0002 2.406250 13.001875 i think it's uh a good idea um i grew up uh my teenage years were spent during the sixties graduating uh high school in sixty eight
sw2575B-ms98-a-0003 13.001875 24.358625 um i remember when the Peace Corps movement first came about and i thought it was a very good idea at the time i was one of those uh Kennedy children if you know what i mean and uh
sw2575B-ms98-a-0004 24.358625 25.559125 [silence]
sw2575B-ms98-a-0005 25.559125 32.027375 right now i see a lot of kids who get out of school have no idea what they want to do
sw2575B-ms98-a-0006 32.027375 45.369750 and there's a lot of things out there that we could do uh for our own country let alone other countries and i think that we've got the the people power to do it it's just uh we need to 
sw2575B-ms98-a-0007 45.369750 51.185000 channel it and focus it on some things that that need some fixing up um 
sw2575B-ms98-a-0008 51.185000 59.008000 some examples are this uh some of the things like Jimmy Carter's been involved in uh a little program to you know fix up housing for people
sw2575B-ms98-a-0009 59.008000 67.758750 and there's a lot of housing ah i know in the area that i live in it's run down and beat up but it could be fixed up and used and it's just you know sitting there wasting away

sw2575B-ms98-a-0015 133.224750 141.151625 yeah i think a lot of people grow up with uh with uh preconceived notions li[ke]- what the world's about
sw2575B-ms98-a-0016 141.151625 144.245250 a lot of it has to do from too much TV
sw2575B-ms98-a-0017 144.245250 157.531750 and uh you know it's there's there's a heck of a lot of difference between you know the intake that you get from TV and and movies and what you hear in school and then what reality is
sw2575B-ms98-a-0018 157.531750 170.681875 uh i remember uh i've i've worked since i was well i started delivering papers when i was ten and i had a real job when i was thirteen so i've you know worked most of my life but i remember when i got out of high school
sw2575B-ms98-a-0019 170.681875 181.773125 all through high school was boy i can't wait to get out of high school i can't wait to get out of high school and i wanted to go to college and i had the grades to go to college and i got accepted to college but when i got out of high school i kind of said
sw2575B-ms98-a-0020 181.773125 186.032625 you know what am i going to do now you know it's like
sw2575B-ms98-a-0021 186.032625 195.402125 you know when i actually started working full time and i i got married shortly after getting out of high school i uh thought i was smart ran away and got married
sw2575B-ms98-a-0022 195.402125 203.587750 and uh i remember there was a time and within the first year of marriage i said boy wouldn't i give to get be back in school
sw2575B-ms98-a-0023 203.587750 216.439125 and just have to do homework and and go work my part time job because life and the reality of working for a living and trying to make ends meet is just so overwhelming to someone
sw2575B-ms98-a-0024 216.439125 218.506875 if they aren't prepared for it
sw2575B-ms98-a-0025 218.506875 219.756125 [silence]
sw2575B-ms98-a-0026 219.756125 221.211625 that's true

sw2575B-ms98-a-0036 274.848625 279.351875 yeah i think once once kids get out and see how
sw2575B-ms98-a-0037 279.351875 285.628125 other people really live and know how bad off some people really are and how good they've got it
sw2575B-ms98-a-0038 285.628125 294.644625 and what it takes to have that good life a[nd]- if you're willing to work for it then they're probably be more inclined to work for it
sw2575B-ms98-a-0039 294.644625 312.866625 [silence]
sw2575B-ms98-a-0040 312.866625 314.843625 uh-huh exactly

sw2575B-ms98-a-0043 334.976875 337.037000 and it's
sw2575B-ms98-a-0044 337.037000 351.137625 it's really hard on them and the you know the thought that i i see the uh the mall rats you know walking around the mall nothing better to do than just walk around the mall all day long when they could be doing something to help someone
sw2575B-ms98-a-0045 351.137625 361.475750 and uh you know you there's a uh a nice warm feeling i remember getting out of doing things like that when i was younger i mean i was a Boy Scout and the whole bit and

sw2575B-ms98-a-0049 394.516875 405.918875 yeah i think there'd there'd be a you know a uh economic benefit for you know everyone concerned those doing the work and those receiving the the uh the services

sw2575B-ms98-a-0053 426.906250 435.323625 yeah i think uh President Bush covered that in his uh State of the Union address this year when he said that you know it's time for
sw2575B-ms98-a-0054 435.323625 442.692125 you know the individuals to start thinking about what they can do to help each other out instead of counting on government to do everything
