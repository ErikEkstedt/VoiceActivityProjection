sw2575A-ms98-a-0018 67.203250 73.734500 yeah we're not too far behind i graduated in seventy one so i'm i'm same generation 
sw2575A-ms98-a-0019 73.734500 85.042125 i i'm it's going to be a short conversation because i agree with you i i think uh i don't i don't even think it ought to be uh voluntary i think it ought to be mandatory 
sw2575A-ms98-a-0020 85.042125 98.208500 uh for kids to either either do military service or public service one of the two uh a lot of reasons for that not not just because i'm a i'm a hard ass or anything it's just that
sw2575A-ms98-a-0021 98.208500 103.397500 like you say kids are getting out of high school not knowing what in the heck they're going to do
sw2575A-ms98-a-0022 103.397500 110.284375 and either the military or public service organization can give them a lot of focus
sw2575A-ms98-a-0023 110.284375 123.669375 and i think that it might stop us some problems later on i mean you know y[ou]- these kids will get their their heads on straight and and figure out what they want to do instead of hanging around street corners selling drugs or something
sw2575A-ms98-a-0024 123.669375 133.662500 uh it's i think it would be good for them uh it helps mature them a little bit and helps them understand the world the way it really is
sw2575A-ms98-a-0025 133.662500 140.239375 [silence]

sw2575A-ms98-a-0039 217.275000 225.552500 and and most of them aren't i mean you look you look at the number of marriages that are occurring right ou[t]- i mean even in high school
sw2575A-ms98-a-0040 225.552500 230.785500 and you know y[ou]- you wonder where are the parents in all of this
sw2575A-ms98-a-0041 230.785500 235.667375 you know why isn't somebody stepping in and and sto[p]- putting a stop to this
sw2575A-ms98-a-0042 235.667375 243.877750 kids in high school are just too young to be married they ha[ve]- they have no idea what the world is like they don't how tough it is out there to make a living
sw2575A-ms98-a-0043 243.877750 251.896125 uh i mean i was in the same boat when i left high school i my parents wanted me to go straight to college and i didn't
sw2575A-ms98-a-0044 251.896125 256.508000 you know i was ready i was ready i had wanderlust i wanted to get out and see some things
sw2575A-ms98-a-0045 256.508000 261.317125 so i joined the Air Force and ended up staying there for thirteen years
sw2575A-ms98-a-0046 261.317125 271.739000 um but i had lived in my own little bubble up until that time and and after traveling around the world a few times i realized that things ain't the way they seem
sw2575A-ms98-a-0047 271.739000 274.748125 and i i did a lot of growing up there uh
sw2575A-ms98-a-0048 274.748125 280.595125 [silence]
sw2575A-ms98-a-0049 280.595125 282.114000 uh-huh

sw2575A-ms98-a-0057 293.898875 303.543125 well you know it's just like you say there's so much stuff that needs to be done here in this country and uh you know if if you could have a thought of something like uh
sw2575A-ms98-a-0058 303.543125 312.976000 like a uh uh a uh Peace Corps sort of organization i mean this would be so useful just in uh for instance just helping old folks 
sw2575A-ms98-a-0059 312.976000 324.519625 you know they you know they need help they don't have anybody to depend on and it would be nice to have somebody come over and cut their yard or paint their house or do minor repairs or something like that
sw2575A-ms98-a-0060 324.519625 325.836750 and
sw2575A-ms98-a-0061 325.836750 334.028500 [silence]

sw2575A-ms98-a-0067 358.063625 359.486750 yeah
sw2575A-ms98-a-0068 359.486750 367.959375 yeah my mom's in the same position late sixties and and it got to the got to the point where i mean me and my brother both were were gone
sw2575A-ms98-a-0069 367.959375 377.444875 and she couldn't maintain the house without large expenditures of money you know it finally got to a point where she just had to sell it and move into an apartment
sw2575A-ms98-a-0070 377.444875 379.427250 and uh
sw2575A-ms98-a-0071 379.427250 387.914500 i i'm not i'm not saying that that wouldn't have happened anyway but it would have been nice if there had been somebody to come around and take care of the little things
sw2575A-ms98-a-0072 387.914500 392.480500 you know like the like the yard work and little repairs and
sw2575A-ms98-a-0073 392.480500 394.949750 painting and stuff like that
sw2575A-ms98-a-0074 394.949750 400.607125 [silence]
sw2575A-ms98-a-0075 400.607125 403.280500 oh yeah sure
sw2575A-ms98-a-0076 403.280500 404.463000 [silence]
sw2575A-ms98-a-0077 404.463000 419.235750 sure i mean i mean the kids who would be giving the service are going to get a lot more out of it than just money you know that i i remember when i was a kid i used to do little little things for the old folks around the neighborhood and uh i know how it made me feel
sw2575A-ms98-a-0078 419.235750 421.603250 you know you s[o]-
sw2575A-ms98-a-0079 421.603250 427.335750 uh peo[ple]- people just don't help people anymore they're they're out for themselves
sw2575A-ms98-a-0080 427.335750 440.499750 [silence]
sw2575A-ms98-a-0081 440.499750 448.203000 yeah well that's that's the that's the point we've gotten to you know every time somebody wants something they always turn to the government
sw2575A-ms98-a-0082 448.203000 461.038625 and y[ou]- the government's going to be limited i where are they going to get the money they're going to get it from us and we can do it a lot more efficiently than the government we don't need to add fourteen layers of bureaucracy to a program
sw2575A-ms98-a-0083 461.038625 471.214000 um the thing that Carter works on uh Habitat For Humanity i was involved in that w[as]- uh in Montgomery before i came up to North Carolina
sw2575A-ms98-a-0084 471.214000 482.977000 and uh it was it was a pretty neat little program we'd just go out and they would buy a plot of land and contractors and builders and everybody else would donate their their time
sw2575A-ms98-a-0085 482.977000 490.017125 and uh the materials were at cost and we'd put up houses and that was kind that was kind of neat
sw2575A-ms98-a-0086 490.017125 495.074375 i uh in a way i think it's a little bit inefficient but but it's better than nothing
sw2575A-ms98-a-0087 495.074375 500.750375 and and at least i had the opportunity of seeing two families move into decent housing
sw2575A-ms98-a-0088 500.750375 513.048625 um course on the other hand i can start complaining very loudly about people on public assistance who are quite capable of doing something for themselves but just won't
sw2575A-ms98-a-0089 513.048625 521.035125 because it's far more advantageous for them to sit there and just draw uh welfare money than it is to work
sw2575A-ms98-a-0090 521.035125 525.620000 uh we did a uh a cost comparison in one of my courses
sw2575A-ms98-a-0091 525.620000 539.123500 and we took all the benefits that a family that a a married couple with two kids would get under welfare and what they would be making at minimum wage and they came out four thousand dollars better a year by taking welfare
sw2575A-ms98-a-0092 539.123500 541.993500 so there's no incentive for them to do anything
sw2575A-ms98-a-0093 541.993500 545.796375 far better for them to sit on their butts and draw the money
sw2575A-ms98-a-0094 545.796375 553.191875 [silence]
sw2575A-ms98-a-0095 553.191875 555.144750 you had to do something
sw2575A-ms98-a-0096 555.144750 560.859000 yeah a[nd]- an[d]- and that's been tried that was tried in Alabama too and it got shot down
sw2575A-ms98-a-0097 560.859000 569.380250 i d[on't]- and i don't understand the reasoning for it i really don't it it seems perfectly logical that if somebody's going to take public money
sw2575A-ms98-a-0098 569.380250 576.649125 then they should return something to the public i mean if nothing else go out along an interstate and pick up garbage
sw2575A-ms98-a-0099 576.649125 578.118625 [silence]
sw2575A-ms98-a-0100 578.118625 583.594375 yeah what do they what do they do in Maryland do they use highway people or do they use prisoners
sw2575A-ms98-a-0101 583.594375 585.314750 [silence]
sw2575A-ms98-a-0102 585.314750 588.384000 yeah tha[t]- that's the way they did it in Alabama too
sw2575A-ms98-a-0103 588.384000 593.732875 u[sually]- usually you'd see these big chain gangs out [laughter-there] picking up trash 
sw2575A-ms98-a-0104 593.732875 596.540625 [silence]
sw2575A-ms98-a-0105 596.540625 599.566000 uh-huh uh-huh yeah we have that here in North Carolina
