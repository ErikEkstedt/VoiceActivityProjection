sw2585A-ms98-a-0003 2.975250 13.208500 [silence]
sw2585A-ms98-a-0004 13.208500 23.606500 [laughter] well i think it's a very very complicated and i sort of i see perspectives on all sides uh and i've re[ally]-
sw2585A-ms98-a-0005 23.606500 32.256750 have no hope for solutions but um i do keep myself somewhat abreast of the issue i have worked with uh uh
sw2585A-ms98-a-0006 32.256750 39.030125 a little bit with refugees from Southeast Asia uh who've come over um
sw2585A-ms98-a-0007 39.030125 52.572875 you know to escape the genocide programs that are over there and seen you know heard about some of the problems that they've had and i'm also fairly sensitive to the issues about how open should the borders be because i
sw2585A-ms98-a-0008 52.572875 59.186625 in general like a smaller rather than a larger population to the land area and um
sw2585A-ms98-a-0009 59.186625 66.290625 i'm in California which has a lot of immigration probably more than any where else in the country though i'm not sure if that's the case
sw2585A-ms98-a-0010 66.290625 68.124625 uh-huh yeah
sw2585A-ms98-a-0011 68.124625 69.884125 um-hum um-hum
sw2585A-ms98-a-0012 69.884125 77.110750 [silence]

sw2585A-ms98-a-0015 87.542750 94.296375 yeah sure well Texas used to be part of Mexico or most of it [laughter]
sw2585A-ms98-a-0016 94.296375 95.420750 [silence]
sw2585A-ms98-a-0017 95.420750 96.708500 [noise]
sw2585A-ms98-a-0018 96.708500 100.508375 [silence]
sw2585A-ms98-a-0019 100.508375 106.869875 i- i don't either it's a really delicate uh moral issue because i[f]- if you have
sw2585A-ms98-a-0020 106.869875 115.320250 well i guess the one thing i do see that is is that needs to be a solution is that if you do let people into the country i do feel you have a certain obligation
sw2585A-ms98-a-0021 115.320250 123.065375 to to get them on their feet because otherwise what you're doing is you're letting people in and you're you're dooming them to being underclass people
sw2585A-ms98-a-0022 123.065375 131.902500 you know you're dooming them to ghetto life or whatever and i know that that the Southeast Asians the Hmong people that i've done some work with uh
sw2585A-ms98-a-0023 131.902500 144.056875 feel really quite hurt and and unsure of themselves when here because they're coming from you know from the slash and burn intercultural society you know they're coming from the middle ages basically and they're being plunked down in plunked down into America
sw2585A-ms98-a-0024 144.056875 157.026625 many of them had been promised by the CIA during the war over there that because they cooperated with the CIA and they helped the CIA out that when they came here the CIA would help establish them in America and the CIA of course isn't doing that and uh
sw2585A-ms98-a-0025 157.026625 168.546000 [noise] so they come here and they don't know wh[at]- what the heck they're doing and they're finding themselves adrift in the big cities and of course there are people in the big cities who would do like nothing better than to take advantage of them_1
sw2585A-ms98-a-0026 168.546000 183.419125 and they're they're incredible victims of crime and part of it is this lack of lack of basic information being dissimilated and i'm not saying it's easy to do and i know there are a few people who are trying but but the funding isn't there for very much work to be going on
sw2585A-ms98-a-0027 183.419125 190.515750 [silence]
sw2585A-ms98-a-0028 190.515750 201.848500 uh yeah exactly y[eah]- ha[ve]- i mean these are people who don't have the foggiest idea about what America's like um and it's ver[y]- it's i
sw2585A-ms98-a-0029 201.848500 211.383875 i couldn't really conceptualize how hard it was to understand that until i until i met with them and i realized that they some of the information that i just you know don't even realize and know is information
sw2585A-ms98-a-0030 211.383875 221.438125 they don't have and i never thought well i guess that is something you need to know you know people getting into trouble because they come here and so they start farming on uh available land you know like the median strips on freeways
sw2585A-ms98-a-0031 221.438125 233.493500 because_1 no one's using it but then someone comes along and says you can't do that you know why can't they they have no idea why not some some of them you know the ones that have been here longer and have been in you know understand now but when they initially come over
sw2585A-ms98-a-0032 233.493500 235.019625 [silence]
sw2585A-ms98-a-0033 235.019625 240.997875 yeah because_1 they're farmers these are all farmers coming over and they're being put in the middle of the city
sw2585A-ms98-a-0034 240.997875 242.646375 [silence]
sw2585A-ms98-a-0035 242.646375 249.709250 i mean they're nomadic farmers you know they're people who farm on the hillside and then leave the hillside to another hillside and farm on that hillside
sw2585A-ms98-a-0036 249.709250 259.588000 these are people who've never seen flat ground before and people who've never seen property rights before you know these people who've never seen any machines other than those used in war
sw2585A-ms98-a-0037 259.588000 273.860750 and uh they have you know so i- i- i do have a lot of sympathy for them and i feel that America could try a little bit harder to to help people adjusting to the American way because_1 if they don't you're just going to produce
sw2585A-ms98-a-0038 273.860750 282.890375 you know you're going to produce an underclass you know you're going to get a situation that i think a lot like what happened to the blacks being sort of led out of slavery and then
sw2585A-ms98-a-0039 282.890375 291.463000 then many of them ended up just working the same jobs they were as slaves then and there was no real up upward movement and not being yeah um
sw2585A-ms98-a-0040 291.463000 293.431750 [silence]
sw2585A-ms98-a-0041 293.431750 304.603750 well i- i wasn't helping them i worked with them not to help them but [laughter-actually] for my own purposes i'm i'm a linguist and i was uh doing a language trying to learn their language a little bit
sw2585A-ms98-a-0042 304.603750 312.649000 and i actually um i mean helped them them in the sense that they received money for working with me but i didn't i didn't i wasn't a social worker or anything like that
sw2585A-ms98-a-0043 312.649000 315.577125 i do have friends who have tried to do more social work
sw2585A-ms98-a-0044 315.577125 321.427625 you know by explaining to people how the language and what the problems learning English might be and such
sw2585A-ms98-a-0045 321.427625 332.474000 because_1 all the models of teaching English are based on teaching English to Spanish speakers or to other European language speakers and people don't realize how different some of the languages they speak are
sw2585A-ms98-a-0046 332.474000 335.165250 [silence]
sw2585A-ms98-a-0047 335.165250 338.535750 oh you are uh-huh well you
sw2585A-ms98-a-0048 338.535750 345.243250 [silence]
sw2585A-ms98-a-0049 345.243250 347.946750 [noise] that's that's been my impression
sw2585A-ms98-a-0050 347.946750 355.815375 yeah it's it's not they're not withholding information they just don't have that information they they haven't the foggiest idea
sw2585A-ms98-a-0051 355.815375 357.161750 [silence]
sw2585A-ms98-a-0052 357.161750 358.536375 yes
sw2585A-ms98-a-0053 358.536375 364.030500 and Spanish is pretty close to English really and Spanish is a lot like English
sw2585A-ms98-a-0054 364.030500 366.200375 yeah yeah
sw2585A-ms98-a-0055 366.200375 367.719000 yeah

sw2585A-ms98-a-0069 405.390000 419.385750 yeah it would be a good experience and you'd be helping people i'm sure very much and and i- i mean not to put not to trivialize the problems of any immigrant group but i do know the Asian groups are having a lot of trouble i mean and part of the problem is that
sw2585A-ms98-a-0070 419.385750 429.769125 a lot of Chinese and Japanese immigration from you know decades ago has been very successful because they valued education and so forth they became a very successful immigrant group
sw2585A-ms98-a-0071 429.769125 435.720750 but and but a lot of people coming over from Vietnam right now coming from war torn countries are
sw2585A-ms98-a-0072 435.720750 445.420000 are n[ot]- not having the same success i think some people have just assumed well why why can't you be successful the Japanese were or the Chinese were or something And it's really much more complicated
sw2585A-ms98-a-0073 445.420000 446.948125 [silence]
sw2585A-ms98-a-0074 446.948125 449.069125 yeah the times are different yeah

sw2585A-ms98-a-0083 468.245500 480.371625 oh yeah i- i think it's a wonderful thing to do and there's a lot there's a lot more i guess another possible solution is since taxpayers aren't going to start paying more money for this and and other budgets aren't going to be cut to pay for it
sw2585A-ms98-a-0084 480.371625 484.206750 uh more of the volunteer network service because_1 everyone gains from it
sw2585A-ms98-a-0085 484.206750 486.905500 would be would might be really useful
sw2585A-ms98-a-0086 486.905500 494.399625 um and if it's you know uh just people helping people i think makes [laughter] makes the community so much happier
