sw2561A-ms98-a-0008 36.956250 39.312000 and they g[ave]- gave it to her anyway
sw2561A-ms98-a-0009 39.312000 41.145500 [silence]
sw2561A-ms98-a-0010 41.145500 49.108000 we had my grandfather had Alzh[eimer's]- Alzheimer's disease and [vocalized-noise] my grandmother kept him at home as long as she could
sw2561A-ms98-a-0011 49.108000 56.677500 actually my parents and my uncle and aunt who tried to convince them_1 to go into like an old age community where he could have gotten care
sw2561A-ms98-a-0012 56.677500 66.188375 and she could've had help with somebody cleaning and things like that and she refused she she just didn't want to do it she felt i- i don't know maybe too much guilt or something
sw2561A-ms98-a-0013 66.188375 75.548875 [silence]

sw2561A-ms98-a-0016 79.338625 81.926500 and so eventually they were forced to put her [vocalized-noise]
sw2561A-ms98-a-0017 81.926500 86.806750 yes well my grandfather he eventually completely lost
sw2561A-ms98-a-0018 86.806750 94.022250 control type of things i- i mean i don't know if he ever really got violent but they put him in a nursing home and actually the problem
sw2561A-ms98-a-0019 94.022250 103.595875 that they had with him was more with the hospital the the nursing home you know some day he had a fever or something so they sent him to a hospital which is what they think to routinely do which i think is ridiculous too
sw2561A-ms98-a-0020 103.595875 109.489500 you know because_1 they might not be really be sick and at the hospital they um did an electrocardiogram
sw2561A-ms98-a-0021 109.489500 113.614500 and decided that he had a heart problem and you know here he was
sw2561A-ms98-a-0022 113.614500 125.712500 very old he had Alzheimer's he'd been like a vegetable for a year and the hospital said oh we have to put in a pacemaker and you know wanted to prove approval for it and all this sort of stuff and eventually
sw2561A-ms98-a-0023 125.712500 136.894750 you know the whole family is in an uproar discussing it and some of the kids said well th[ey]- yeah they should do it and others you know said it's ridiculous this man whose body finally wants to die just let him die and um
sw2561A-ms98-a-0024 136.894750 148.525250 eventually the at the h[ospital]- they said no to the doctor and they found out it wasn't even his electrocardiogram that there was some other patient you know by the time he'd been sent back to the nursing home and
sw2561A-ms98-a-0025 148.525250 150.379500 under care there
sw2561A-ms98-a-0026 150.379500 151.600625 but
sw2561A-ms98-a-0027 151.600625 153.029625 oh

sw2561A-ms98-a-0031 161.999000 167.340625 [vocalized-noise] sometimes you just can't keep the person at home they're just [vocalized-noise] know
sw2561A-ms98-a-0032 167.340625 178.538875 [silence]
sw2561A-ms98-a-0033 178.538875 184.833250 oh i felt went to visit my grandfather one time in the nursing home and i said never again i said i just can't go

sw2561A-ms98-a-0037 191.490250 205.193625 but i had a cousin of mine that was in a different nursing home which was sort of nicer y[ou]- know and until really close to the end she was able to go out and take walks and things and they took her outside and in some ways i think it might have even
sw2561A-ms98-a-0038 205.193625 213.528125 been better or i- i- s[ay]- say cousin's like my grandmother's [laughter-cousin] but i had been really close to her and in some ways i think for her might have even been better because_1 she used to live in 
sw2561A-ms98-a-0039 213.528125 218.521000 an area that when she moved down there was mostly elderly people [vocalized-noise] well not
sw2561A-ms98-a-0040 218.521000 221.746875 you know it was like a community of apartments that
sw2561A-ms98-a-0041 221.746875 233.965875 were mostly elderly when she moved there she might have been like sixty it wasn't you know ancient but you know older and then that community for some reason started getting the apartments [vocalized-noise] were fairly low income i guess 
sw2561A-ms98-a-0042 233.965875 239.972125 and started being bought out by families and things and she started having fewer and fewer friends
sw2561A-ms98-a-0043 239.972125 245.074750 and people just sh[e]- sh[e]- sh[e]- she used to say to me wh[en]- at when she was ninety two or something at the time say
sw2561A-ms98-a-0044 245.074750 255.655250 um you know i just i- all my friends have died off i have nothing to do i'm bored y[ou]- know i walk over to the store i walk back someone comes and picks me up and brings me to the community and so when she went to a nursing home
sw2561A-ms98-a-0045 255.655250 262.165750 in the beginning i think she kind of liked it she did art work there she did it was almost a progressive type nursing home

sw2561A-ms98-a-0053 294.592875 296.529125 uh-huh well i'm sure
sw2561A-ms98-a-0054 296.529125 301.183875 does the medical care in nursing homes is typically less than
sw2561A-ms98-a-0055 301.183875 304.804625 in but are they supposed to be able to give as much 
sw2561A-ms98-a-0056 304.804625 306.854750 home care you know
sw2561A-ms98-a-0057 306.854750 320.806500 [silence]

sw2561A-ms98-a-0066 343.055875 351.452875 had they checked into these nursing homes much before they put her in it or they just sort of i mean i- it's something that's hard to even get places in there you're lucky if you get a spot
sw2561A-ms98-a-0067 351.452875 358.141375 [silence]

sw2561A-ms98-a-0076 395.575875 398.548375 often times i've gone into nursing homes where
sw2561A-ms98-a-0077 398.548375 405.035500 you know they have like a central area where they take the people to and all you do is to just sort of sit there like
sw2561A-ms98-a-0078 405.035500 417.803000 [noise] you know almost like they're mentally retarded patients or something and some of them y[ou]- know they're just sitting in the wheelchair and sleeping or whatever and it's jus[t]- it's heart breaking you know an[d]- and i- i feel like you know what have i moved into an[d]- and they're
sw2561A-ms98-a-0079 417.803000 421.558500 [vocalized-noise] some of them i think just needs stimulation

sw2561A-ms98-a-0091 471.416750 479.561875 that's crazy but i think they're under st[ress]- i mean i can't imagine working in a nursing home like that either because it must be so depressing

sw2561A-ms98-a-0093 482.000000 490.082125 but you know when i see them i don't know that i could [vocalized-noise] when i think of my parents who fortunately shouldn't be close to getting there yet but i don't [vocalized-noise] think of
sw2561A-ms98-a-0094 490.082125 491.522250 [silence]
sw2561A-ms98-a-0095 491.522250 496.014250 having to make the decision as to put them into a place like that or not

sw2561A-ms98-a-0098 504.077750 509.350125 i guess i would try and have somebody at the house as long as they were healthy enough but sometimes they're
sw2561A-ms98-a-0099 509.350125 516.637375 not i- i don't know [vocalized-noise] where have the old days gone where people just sort of died of something in their family houses and they're you know
sw2561A-ms98-a-0100 516.637375 519.487125 people are stabbed but it's not this torture

sw2561A-ms98-a-0106 536.158500 550.270375 sort of you know they just died of something um but th[e]- my grand[mother]- my grandmother's case which is very sad she fell she came into New York to visit and she fell at the airport going down some steps and spent you know six months in the hospital but it was still it it wa[s]- it wasn't 
sw2561A-ms98-a-0107 550.270375 552.764750 you know the same as a nursing home type of thing

sw2561A-ms98-a-0109 554.092375 560.677500 yeah no tha[t]- that was that was horrible it was [vocalized-noise] and sh[e]- she never even got to see her family that she came in to visit

sw2561A-ms98-a-0114 569.672625 574.928375 fell and cr[acked]- cracked her skull open and that was sort of it but jus[t]- terrible

sw2561A-ms98-a-0118 584.770000 589.862625 but it's just a scary thought every ti[me]- i certainly don't want to be like that someday
