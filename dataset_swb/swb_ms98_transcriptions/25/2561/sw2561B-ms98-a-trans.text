sw2561B-ms98-a-0073 261.501500 272.535000 well if you're not in real bad shape it's it's you know a reti[rement]- a retirement home i[s]- is is a good idea for somebody like that but uh if you've got a lot of health problems
sw2561B-ms98-a-0074 272.535000 279.613625 i[t]- it it's just it's a m[ess]- it's just a big huge mess because_1 because_1 my husband's grandmother has a lot of health problems
sw2561B-ms98-a-0075 279.613625 281.099000 and uh
sw2561B-ms98-a-0076 281.099000 294.937875 and h[is]- like his other par[ents]- grandparents on his other side both were in a nursing home and his grand[mother]- his other g[randmother]- his dad's mother finally went into a coma and she was in a coma for almost two years in a nursing before before she passed away and that that was awful
sw2561B-ms98-a-0077 294.937875 295.968375 [silence]

sw2561B-ms98-a-0082 304.700625 313.262000 well well well what what they do is is they're supposed to monitor them but they don't monitor them very well at all
sw2561B-ms98-a-0083 313.262000 323.608250 i mean that that's the problem uh his grandmother that's in it now she had a stroke and they didn't catch it for three days if you can imagine such a thing
sw2561B-ms98-a-0084 323.608250 332.499125 so that so then that she that was when she got moved from the first one to the second one [laughter] where she was given penicillin
sw2561B-ms98-a-0085 332.499125 344.085250 at the second one and now she's at the third one [laughter] so it's it it it it's been a really bad situation but i have but that's all i hear about nursing homes is bad situations
sw2561B-ms98-a-0086 344.085250 350.880875 [silence]
sw2561B-ms98-a-0087 350.880875 354.072625 well that yes tha[t]- that's true uh but um 
sw2561B-ms98-a-0088 354.072625 365.832750 they're in a smaller small area and our an[d]- in fact they're over up in Missouri an[d]- an[d]- an[d]- and and what i would you would really consider a rural area an[d]- where there's like one nursing home per town 
sw2561B-ms98-a-0089 365.832750 367.220750 [silence]
sw2561B-ms98-a-0090 367.220750 373.857875 yes oh no no no there's not there is not a whole lot of choice so they've they've moved through three different towns now 
sw2561B-ms98-a-0091 373.857875 376.187750 so um
sw2561B-ms98-a-0092 376.187750 388.375125 it is and it the regu[lations]- i don't think the gov[ernment]- the government regulations are the place i i don't think are are adequate either because_1 they just don't the ones i've been in just don't aren't real real clean
sw2561B-ms98-a-0093 388.375125 396.962500 uh you know they do they do a halfway decent job but i- it seems like they're they're they tend to be kind of slack

sw2561B-ms98-a-0095 401.872500 403.336250 leave them

sw2561B-ms98-a-0106 420.836125 426.174875 yeah i mean it's almost like a mental hospital atmosphere instead of a nursing home

sw2561B-ms98-a-0108 427.182125 431.033375 well me neither but but it just seems like that's what it would be like
