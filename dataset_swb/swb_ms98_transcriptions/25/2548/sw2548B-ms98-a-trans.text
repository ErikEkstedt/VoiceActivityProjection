sw2548B-ms98-a-0028 80.690125 87.969625 i never really had anything major with my Mazda but it was a standard also and the clutch went out on it toward the end i had it five years
sw2548B-ms98-a-0029 87.969625 94.924875 and the last year or last two years it seemed to go out really easily i think it went out twice in two years
sw2548B-ms98-a-0030 94.924875 98.640625 and that's that's a lot it shouldn't go out that much
sw2548B-ms98-a-0031 98.640625 106.340375 and so i went ahead and bought another standard when i bought the Honda but i don't think i'm going to do that again i think i'm going back to automatic now

sw2548B-ms98-a-0054 175.057750 183.056625 i looked at the Mitsubishi Galant i was looking for a four door car having driven the RX seven so long and it was so small
sw2548B-ms98-a-0055 183.056625 193.727625 and it's really impractical so i wanted something with a real trunk and four doors something easy to get in and out of and i looked at the Galant and those were really nice and you can get them_1 for a great price
sw2548B-ms98-a-0056 193.727625 201.382375 but i found it hard to deal with the dealership i was going through so that's how i ended up with a Honda
