sw2527A-ms98-a-0007 28.691750 32.520375 so you do uh like backpacking and the like

sw2527A-ms98-a-0010 43.954875 48.618750 [silence]

sw2527A-ms98-a-0012 49.899375 51.226375 [silence]
sw2527A-ms98-a-0013 51.226375 54.106500 is the Ozarks in Arkansas
sw2527A-ms98-a-0014 54.106500 55.290875 [silence]
sw2527A-ms98-a-0015 55.290875 58.588625 yeah so that's probably a pretty nice place to go
sw2527A-ms98-a-0016 58.588625 71.373125 [silence]
sw2527A-ms98-a-0017 71.373125 72.672125 um-hum
sw2527A-ms98-a-0018 72.672125 80.956125 [silence]
sw2527A-ms98-a-0019 80.956125 82.413125 yeah
sw2527A-ms98-a-0020 82.413125 85.476000 [silence]
sw2527A-ms98-a-0021 85.476000 93.891875 oh i've been camping for years not on a regular basis but uh i first started camping out in the desert in California
sw2527A-ms98-a-0022 93.891875 98.325250 and then sometimes in the mountains also in California
sw2527A-ms98-a-0023 98.325250 106.803500 and uh then i moved to North Carolina and i i didn't camp for a long time and then i started to uh
sw2527A-ms98-a-0024 106.803500 114.409625 go camping again kind of in conjunction with white water rafting so i'd go up somewhere and camp overnight and then do some rafting
sw2527A-ms98-a-0025 114.409625 117.858750 and then maybe camp another night and drive home
sw2527A-ms98-a-0026 117.858750 119.675625 [silence]
sw2527A-ms98-a-0027 119.675625 125.886500 and that was uh that was pretty good so i went out and bought a whole bunch of camping gear
sw2527A-ms98-a-0028 125.886500 127.842375 and uh
sw2527A-ms98-a-0029 127.842375 129.307625 [silence]
sw2527A-ms98-a-0030 129.307625 131.902375 you know i still do it once in a while
sw2527A-ms98-a-0031 131.902375 140.966375 [silence]
sw2527A-ms98-a-0032 140.966375 142.943500 uh-huh yeah
sw2527A-ms98-a-0033 142.943500 147.047625 [silence]
sw2527A-ms98-a-0034 147.047625 160.326000 uh well it's it's uh in terms of north south i would say it's uh a little a little more towards the northern border of the state and pretty much in the eastern half of it
sw2527A-ms98-a-0035 160.326000 161.433125 [silence]
sw2527A-ms98-a-0036 161.433125 163.245250 so what it
sw2527A-ms98-a-0037 163.245250 165.036875 [silence]
sw2527A-ms98-a-0038 165.036875 175.114875 well it it's uh actually the the Blue Ridge in Virginia are closer to Raleigh they're about three hours away if you go due north
sw2527A-ms98-a-0039 175.114875 184.535625 um uh the Blue Ridge in North Carolina i think are much nicer and you can pick those up going west but then you're talking about six to eight hours
sw2527A-ms98-a-0040 184.535625 186.673000 the way it works
sw2527A-ms98-a-0041 186.673000 188.515875 but um
sw2527A-ms98-a-0042 188.515875 189.817000 [silence]
sw2527A-ms98-a-0043 189.817000 200.063125 it's a real it's a real nice place to go and camp and there's some pretty decent campgrounds although i don't think Raleigh i don't think the state of North Carolina takes
sw2527A-ms98-a-0044 200.063125 204.229125 they probably just don't spend as much money as a lot of other states might
sw2527A-ms98-a-0045 204.229125 215.690000 [silence]
sw2527A-ms98-a-0046 215.690000 218.457875 i think there's quite a few
sw2527A-ms98-a-0047 218.457875 221.821625 i can't say i've checked them_1 all out though
sw2527A-ms98-a-0048 221.821625 228.029875 [silence]
sw2527A-ms98-a-0049 228.029875 234.027750 it's uh it's actually kind of incredible it's really really nice
sw2527A-ms98-a-0050 234.027750 236.064625 um
sw2527A-ms98-a-0051 236.064625 242.536125 i like it better than almost anything i've ever done just the sky is so
sw2527A-ms98-a-0052 242.536125 244.418250 amazing
sw2527A-ms98-a-0053 244.418250 246.656000 you know you really can
sw2527A-ms98-a-0054 246.656000 251.131625 probably count thousands of stars and uh
sw2527A-ms98-a-0055 251.131625 256.908125 it's it's just kind of nice i like the uh i think the desert has a rare kind of beauty
sw2527A-ms98-a-0056 256.908125 259.012875 which um
sw2527A-ms98-a-0057 259.012875 260.025625 [silence]
sw2527A-ms98-a-0058 260.025625 266.543875 a lot of people don't realize you know they hear desert and they think of scorpions and snakes and sand and
sw2527A-ms98-a-0059 266.543875 275.452875 being real dry and lack of water course it it has all of those qualities but it also has a certain quality of beauty that's
sw2527A-ms98-a-0060 275.452875 278.888125 you just don't find anywhere else except in a desert
sw2527A-ms98-a-0061 278.888125 281.086625 [silence]
sw2527A-ms98-a-0062 281.086625 284.367750 so it's pretty nice the uh
sw2527A-ms98-a-0063 284.367750 291.994250 the movie The Doors has so[me]- some nice desert scenes those guys all go camping out in the desert
sw2527A-ms98-a-0064 291.994250 295.149500 of course they drag a lot of drugs with them_1 but
sw2527A-ms98-a-0065 295.149500 297.115750 um
sw2527A-ms98-a-0066 297.115750 306.708125 the uh the shots are are pretty nice and it's sort of like that i mean it's just almost surreal in some places it's very pleasant
sw2527A-ms98-a-0067 306.708125 309.931625 [silence]
sw2527A-ms98-a-0068 309.931625 317.177625 they can be yeah i mean you got to you sort of have to choose your season carefully and know what's going to happen
sw2527A-ms98-a-0069 317.177625 320.277250 what i've been i've been camping in Death Valley

sw2527A-ms98-a-0072 323.716500 330.678625 but it's beautiful in February i mean it's just beautiful the days get up into the high eighties
sw2527A-ms98-a-0073 330.678625 338.600875 uh maybe the nineties but it's it's quite bearable and then the nights are reasonably warm you know sixties or seventies
sw2527A-ms98-a-0074 338.600875 342.448500 it's just great it's really very nice
sw2527A-ms98-a-0075 342.448500 356.082375 [silence]
