sw2517B-ms98-a-0083 469.471625 474.782375 no no not these these are these are all purebreds [vocalized-noise] 
sw2517B-ms98-a-0084 474.782375 476.479750 oh yeah
sw2517B-ms98-a-0085 476.479750 483.486000 uh stolen run away no i doubt it but i don't want them_1 breeding with any
sw2517B-ms98-a-0086 483.486000 487.485625 yeah with any any weird strange cat around here
sw2517B-ms98-a-0087 487.485625 491.289125 we're going to be looking for a stud for this one pretty soon
sw2517B-ms98-a-0088 491.289125 492.488500 [silence]
sw2517B-ms98-a-0089 492.488500 495.714250 she's uh four months right now
sw2517B-ms98-a-0090 495.714250 505.798875 well no well no we have but you have to line up a stud several months in advance she'll be going into heat probably around uh July or August
sw2517B-ms98-a-0091 505.798875 507.201875 [silence]
sw2517B-ms98-a-0092 507.201875 508.498375 yeah
sw2517B-ms98-a-0093 508.498375 512.988000 [noise] yeah you get you your best litter is usually your first one
sw2517B-ms98-a-0094 512.988000 516.721000 [silence]
sw2517B-ms98-a-0095 516.721000 529.237375 nah so it's sort of an old wife or common folk tales about you know if you're going to have a cat spayed let it go through heat first not true because when they go into heat their uh
sw2517B-ms98-a-0096 529.237375 539.998375 genetic parts swell up and expand and everything and then once you do take them_1 into surgery it's a little more difficult easier to have them_1 spayed before they even go into heat
sw2517B-ms98-a-0097 539.998375 546.983375 but but when they first go into heat uh that's the time when you want to breed them_1 especially the purebreds
sw2517B-ms98-a-0098 546.983375 549.761375 <b_aside> we'll find you a nice handsome stud <e_aside>

sw2517B-ms98-a-0101 553.991000 559.216375 just twice for her and we're going to end up probably keeping one out of each litter
sw2517B-ms98-a-0102 559.216375 560.495500 [silence]
sw2517B-ms98-a-0103 560.495500 568.479500 [noise] um not too awfully uh uh She[ba]- Sheba cost us uh two hundred dollars
