sw2508A-ms98-a-0002 1.021625 3.918250 how do you uh manage your budget
sw2508A-ms98-a-0003 3.918250 54.934750 [silence]
sw2508A-ms98-a-0004 54.934750 56.203500 um-hum

sw2508A-ms98-a-0006 66.368750 67.885500 yeah
sw2508A-ms98-a-0007 67.885500 75.415125 well i in my younger years i'd always heard the adage you should uh buy as much of a house as you can afford
sw2508A-ms98-a-0008 75.415125 79.475500 uh because of the uh improvement in real estate prices
sw2508A-ms98-a-0009 79.475500 84.329375 and on the last move we bought ourselves a fairly large house
sw2508A-ms98-a-0010 84.329375 87.724250 and i've got some pretty stiff mortgage payments now
sw2508A-ms98-a-0011 87.724250 90.624000 and uh the uh
sw2508A-ms98-a-0012 90.624000 103.656375 improvement in uh income and uh investments and so forth has not uh come at the rate i've expected so we're still kind of hurting by the uh high mortgage payments and we haven't gotten out from under them yet
sw2508A-ms98-a-0013 103.656375 104.713000 [silence]
sw2508A-ms98-a-0014 104.713000 106.257625 but uh
sw2508A-ms98-a-0015 106.257625 109.446500 so far we've managed to hold our own by uh
sw2508A-ms98-a-0016 109.446500 110.609125 [silence]
sw2508A-ms98-a-0017 110.609125 114.113375 trying to set up a a monthly budget
sw2508A-ms98-a-0018 114.113375 121.774750 uh i try to take out just so much cash for me and my uh give so much cash to my wife
sw2508A-ms98-a-0019 121.774750 125.820750 to spend on groceries and clothing and fuel for the car
sw2508A-ms98-a-0020 125.820750 131.275125 and then the rest of it's uh pretty much fixed expenses uh mortgage electricity
sw2508A-ms98-a-0021 131.275125 133.755000 uh water and uh
sw2508A-ms98-a-0022 133.755000 139.116375 and garbage collection and telephone [laughter-bills] and cable television bills
sw2508A-ms98-a-0023 139.116375 141.295750 and those are pretty much fixed
sw2508A-ms98-a-0024 141.295750 158.330625 [silence]
sw2508A-ms98-a-0025 158.330625 159.538625 yeah

sw2508A-ms98-a-0027 174.514625 175.734250 um-hum
sw2508A-ms98-a-0028 175.734250 196.365875 [silence]
sw2508A-ms98-a-0029 196.365875 201.536875 yeah no my wife's pretty good about uh grocery shopping and
sw2508A-ms98-a-0030 201.536875 205.064500 she pitches in and uh makes clothes for the kids
sw2508A-ms98-a-0031 205.064500 213.657375 uh which is a big help uh one of our big problems though is handling unexpected uh uh budget items
sw2508A-ms98-a-0032 213.657375 217.428375 like this month the uh heat pump went out and uh
sw2508A-ms98-a-0033 217.428375 221.167375 they want pretty close to three thousand dollars just to replace that
sw2508A-ms98-a-0034 221.167375 223.066000 [silence]
sw2508A-ms98-a-0035 223.066000 229.741000 well uh we have to cut into the savings uh at this point to uh to buffer that
sw2508A-ms98-a-0036 229.741000 231.232625 and
sw2508A-ms98-a-0037 231.232625 233.215125 [silence]
sw2508A-ms98-a-0038 233.215125 239.173500 then maybe we'll go for a week or two and or a month or two and then the car [laughter-breaks] [laughter-down] [laughter]
sw2508A-ms98-a-0039 239.173500 243.285625 so it's the unexpected things that make it awful hard to control the budget
sw2508A-ms98-a-0040 243.285625 250.412125 [silence]
sw2508A-ms98-a-0041 250.412125 251.579625 yeah

sw2508A-ms98-a-0065 436.782000 439.588125 yeah w[ell]- we've been looking around at uh 
sw2508A-ms98-a-0066 439.588125 450.139250 uh trying to develop some side activities that that might help out such as uh creating some craft objects that we can market in the uh local stores
sw2508A-ms98-a-0067 450.139250 452.071125 or uh
sw2508A-ms98-a-0068 452.071125 459.593500 uh making uh some dresses for children or things like that or even writing children's [laughter-books]
sw2508A-ms98-a-0069 459.593500 461.568625 and uh
sw2508A-ms98-a-0070 461.568625 473.690500 i tried uh this past year writing uh journal articles but uh i found out it cost me more than the the honorariums i got for writing them_1
sw2508A-ms98-a-0071 473.690500 476.696000 [silence]
sw2508A-ms98-a-0072 476.696000 484.617250 uh well especially the first one because i wound up buying a lot of [laughter-reprints] for [laughter-handouts] and i ate up all my [laughter-profits] with uh
sw2508A-ms98-a-0073 484.617250 485.955375 buying reprints
