sw2508B-ms98-a-0049 230.452875 233.362375 well that's good that you have the savings to get into
sw2508B-ms98-a-0050 233.362375 237.874500 [silence]

sw2508B-ms98-a-0054 242.936375 244.383000 yeah that's
sw2508B-ms98-a-0055 244.383000 250.809750 that's the way we are we've had a lot of unexpected things just in the last uh couple months
sw2508B-ms98-a-0056 250.809750 261.025625 that uh really hit us hard but i've been able to work enough overtime to you know really help with the with covering the expenses
sw2508B-ms98-a-0057 261.025625 271.138000 so but we've never been we've been married for uh nearly four years and we've never been able to save any money and i think it's just
sw2508B-ms98-a-0058 271.138000 281.223375 hit both of us uh just in the past few months that we need to start saving some money no matter what we do we need to put that in our budget and just start doing it
sw2508B-ms98-a-0059 281.223375 284.191375 even if it's you know ten dollars a week
sw2508B-ms98-a-0060 284.191375 289.919000 and so we're going to start doing that or actually we started two paychecks ago
sw2508B-ms98-a-0061 289.919000 295.278125 and that was uh i think that was a really wise decision
sw2508B-ms98-a-0062 295.278125 299.116125 [silence]
sw2508B-ms98-a-0063 299.116125 304.185875 no actually i'm i'm not involved in anything like that at work or
sw2508B-ms98-a-0064 304.185875 309.842000 uh anywhere uh i don't have anything to fall back on at all
sw2508B-ms98-a-0065 309.842000 313.151250 and i- i know that's not wise but
sw2508B-ms98-a-0066 313.151250 323.539250 that's just uh where we're at right now my wife just went back to work part-time uh she can substitute teach at schools
sw2508B-ms98-a-0067 323.539250 333.048375 and uh there's so many school districts and schools here in the metroplex that uh by turning her name in if she wanted to she could work
sw2508B-ms98-a-0068 333.048375 335.301750 you know everyday but
sw2508B-ms98-a-0069 335.301750 345.409125 we're we're just going to let her work one maybe two days a week and we're just going to apply all the money that she makes to uh
sw2508B-ms98-a-0070 345.409125 351.658875 uh our debts and try to get as much out of debt as fast as we can 
sw2508B-ms98-a-0071 351.658875 364.908750 and there's and we're we're Christians and that's uh we've only been Christians for about five years but that's a a real a biblical truth in the Bible is to
sw2508B-ms98-a-0072 364.908750 372.726375 to not be in debt and we're [laughter-really] starting to see the the the reasoning behind that
sw2508B-ms98-a-0073 372.726375 378.689625 and uh because_1 we're you know we're always well i can't be [laughter-sick] this week but one day
sw2508B-ms98-a-0074 378.689625 384.855625 or you know this month but one day because you know our bills will catch up with us if i am
sw2508B-ms98-a-0075 384.855625 389.268750 or you know i c[an't]- we can't go on a two week vacation because
sw2508B-ms98-a-0076 389.268750 402.157250 uh i wouldn't make any overtime in two weeks so that would really hurt us financially and you know just things like that all the time and you know w[e]- we really see how we're 
sw2508B-ms98-a-0077 402.157250 407.273375 you know indebted or nearly underneath uh the debt that we have
sw2508B-ms98-a-0078 407.273375 410.691875 you know and that's that's really hard but
sw2508B-ms98-a-0079 410.691875 417.223375 so far we've never really uh been behind on any bills uh
sw2508B-ms98-a-0080 417.223375 422.490125 i had to put our student loans on hold once for about i think three months
sw2508B-ms98-a-0081 422.490125 425.992750 and we had a a cutback at work
sw2508B-ms98-a-0082 425.992750 429.671625 and uh this is this was a couple of years back
sw2508B-ms98-a-0083 429.671625 437.365750 but anyway but we're doing really good we're not saving but we're staying right even
sw2508B-ms98-a-0084 437.365750 449.681500 [silence]
sw2508B-ms98-a-0085 449.681500 451.526375 oh yeah
