sw2534A-ms98-a-0031 117.601250 120.802000 something something to keep me occupied you see
sw2534A-ms98-a-0032 120.802000 125.649875 i'll uh buy some plastic and make a little house and
sw2534A-ms98-a-0033 125.649875 129.098000 yeah and watch the cats tear it up
sw2534A-ms98-a-0034 129.098000 133.500875 [silence]
sw2534A-ms98-a-0035 133.500875 136.690250 they they just like to get in and dig
sw2534A-ms98-a-0036 136.690250 138.734500 [silence]
sw2534A-ms98-a-0037 138.734500 148.263125 oh they love to dig i had i had some uh i don't know what kind they are i've already forgotten just regular old flower seeds
sw2534A-ms98-a-0038 148.263125 159.869875 and i planted them and i was so i was so thrilled because they came up i mean nice green shoots coming up all over the place and then my cats got into it and started digging and that took care of that
sw2534A-ms98-a-0039 159.869875 165.966125 so i have to hang these things high so they can't get to them especially the catnip
sw2534A-ms98-a-0040 165.966125 167.495625 [silence]

sw2534A-ms98-a-0057 231.697250 236.852375 you know you don't have to put up with all these wild critters coming into your property
sw2534A-ms98-a-0058 236.852375 241.588125 [silence]
sw2534A-ms98-a-0059 241.588125 246.677750 yeah right here [laughter] [vocalized-noise] Bambi [laughter] 
sw2534A-ms98-a-0060 246.677750 248.789750 gosh 
sw2534A-ms98-a-0061 248.789750 256.279000 well let's see other than gardening which i fiddle at i'm not very good at what else do i mostly just computer stuff
sw2534A-ms98-a-0062 256.279000 269.909250 i just like playing with my computer and doing stuff on that uh cooking that's not really a hobby it's a necessity but but i enjoy it i like to think that i'm a very good cook
sw2534A-ms98-a-0063 269.909250 271.971125 [silence]
sw2534A-ms98-a-0064 271.971125 277.766250 hobbies that's about it i don't have much time for hobbies so uh
sw2534A-ms98-a-0065 277.766250 283.594875 between being a student and trying to run a business on the side you don't have a lot of time
sw2534A-ms98-a-0066 283.594875 287.881250 yeah and raising cats
sw2534A-ms98-a-0067 287.881250 289.654875 [silence]
sw2534A-ms98-a-0068 289.654875 299.693000 well it's it started out as a hobby actually uh it just it developed into sort of a business uh you know we breed them and all that
sw2534A-ms98-a-0069 299.693000 308.539750 but we didn't you know we didn't really start it for the money it was just they were fun to have around and we figured if we're going to have them we might as well have some purebreds and
sw2534A-ms98-a-0070 308.539750 309.755375 [silence]
sw2534A-ms98-a-0071 309.755375 318.185000 and now it developed in to going to cat shows and finding studs for them and you know all this kind of stuff
sw2534A-ms98-a-0072 318.185000 324.344125 uh i've got a uh Bombay a Turkish Van and a Himalayan Persian 
sw2534A-ms98-a-0073 324.344125 330.899500 yeah the {himmy} is probably the sweetest one she's she's just a little sweetheart
sw2534A-ms98-a-0074 330.899500 344.765125 we uh the the Bombay had a litter uh last October and i just got her back from the vet this morning getting her spayed only going to breed them once
sw2534A-ms98-a-0075 344.765125 349.063125 and uh she's not she's not feeling too great today
sw2534A-ms98-a-0076 349.063125 351.391000 [silence]
sw2534A-ms98-a-0077 351.391000 358.964750 no uh m[ost]- most breeders are in it for the money so they'll bree[d]- they'll breed them twice a year
sw2534A-ms98-a-0078 358.964750 369.132500 and i i just think that it's kind of i don't know it's kind of cruel you know they just they just breed these they breed them before they're ready uh and
sw2534A-ms98-a-0079 369.132500 375.973375 you're never you're never real and and they they do a lot of inbreeding too and so you end up with you know kind of strange kittens
sw2534A-ms98-a-0080 375.973375 378.039750 and i just don't like that
sw2534A-ms98-a-0081 378.039750 380.088375 [silence]
sw2534A-ms98-a-0082 380.088375 382.962125 we're we sold all that litter
sw2534A-ms98-a-0083 382.962125 384.197125 um
sw2534A-ms98-a-0084 384.197125 387.578250 we there's not that much call to for Bombay's
sw2534A-ms98-a-0085 387.578250 393.810250 um they're they're registered but they're not they're not uh they're not show cats
sw2534A-ms98-a-0086 393.810250 397.161375 uh so all you can do is sell them as pet quality
sw2534A-ms98-a-0087 397.161375 408.609125 uh so what you've got is a registered pet and not too many people want Bombay's they want things like {himmy} Persians and Turkish Vans
sw2534A-ms98-a-0088 408.609125 419.776000 Turkish Vans if you've never seen one i mean you wouldn't know that it was a pure bred it's just uh medium size short hair cat it's got he's mostly white with uh brown and black patches
sw2534A-ms98-a-0089 419.776000 425.328000 but they have nice personalities and they're very inquisitive
sw2534A-ms98-a-0090 425.328000 439.337375 um now the {himmy} we'll probably breed her a couple of times and we'll we'll end up keeping one out of each litter and then breeding those
sw2534A-ms98-a-0091 439.337375 447.321125 it's just the stud fees are so much though cost about three hundred dollars for a stud for her we we want to breed her with a champion so 
sw2534A-ms98-a-0092 447.321125 448.664250 [silence]
sw2534A-ms98-a-0093 448.664250 450.631625 yeah the Persian is
sw2534A-ms98-a-0094 450.631625 453.094375 and the other two are short hairs
sw2534A-ms98-a-0095 453.094375 454.761625 [silence]
sw2534A-ms98-a-0096 454.761625 460.551625 yeah she's uh she's sweet going to have some nice kittens i hope
sw2534A-ms98-a-0097 460.551625 475.352250 she's uh she's if you if you know what a Himalayan is generally they look something like uh well they come in a lot of different colors people don't realize it but they're sort of like uh Siamese in a way they have the uh they have the uh
sw2534A-ms98-a-0098 475.352250 483.474500 they have the gloves on the paws and they're they're usually two colored uh but this one is uh
sw2534A-ms98-a-0099 483.474500 495.892625 is she's pre[dominantly]- predominantly uh black but she has chocolate uh paws chocolate stomach and silver on her hindquarters
sw2534A-ms98-a-0100 495.892625 499.880375 and yeah she's she's quite attractive looking
sw2534A-ms98-a-0101 499.880375 504.170625 hope hope the stud will find her attractive [laughter] 
sw2534A-ms98-a-0102 504.170625 518.656250 and and that she has a whole bunch of kittens but we have to be careful uh you know we have to get a particular color point uh stud you can't just breed them with anything we have to get a uh we have to get a silver point {himmy}
sw2534A-ms98-a-0103 518.656250 522.780875 so the silver will be predominate in the kittens
sw2534A-ms98-a-0104 522.780875 532.621125 that's it that's the fun part trying to figure out what you've got to breed them with can't just go out there and say okay you guys breed you know [laughter]
sw2534A-ms98-a-0105 532.621125 535.204375 that's right
sw2534A-ms98-a-0106 535.204375 541.179375 [silence]
sw2534A-ms98-a-0107 541.179375 553.702000 well actually i mean it it is a business in a way but it it's it's a lot of fun as a hobby especially when you go to shows and get to see all the different cats we're we're about to get another breed we're go[ing]- we're going to buy a Devon Rex 
sw2534A-ms98-a-0108 553.702000 565.940375 and i didn't i don't like Devon Rexes at first it's a well actually it's a mutant it it comes from England and uh fr[om]- in the county of Devon
sw2534A-ms98-a-0109 565.940375 578.972000 and it's a mutant cat and they're they're pretty expensive we're going to we're going to shell out probably about a thousand bucks for one um they're
sw2534A-ms98-a-0110 578.972000 590.391250 very thin they're they're they're long and lanky and skinny and they have real short hair it's curly as a matter of fact
sw2534A-ms98-a-0111 590.391250 598.602000 um yeah it it it's a strange looking cat uh i didn't like them at first they've got great big ears
