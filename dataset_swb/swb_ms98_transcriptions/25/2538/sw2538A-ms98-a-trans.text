sw2538A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 8.160375 some of the political trends that have started up uh i guess in the other side of the ocean as it were some of the uh 
sw2538A-ms98-a-0002 8.160375 19.862625 revolutions and desires for change that's going on over there when that first started going on there was a politician in the US i don't even remember his name but uh
sw2538A-ms98-a-0003 19.862625 28.161500 he made a a not so widely publicized comment that said just wait awhile and see how much US aid ends up going that way
sw2538A-ms98-a-0004 28.161500 39.865500 his and he thought or predicted that Poland would be one of the first ones to start seeing uh both in forms of debt forgiven and uh actual dollar values given over to them
sw2538A-ms98-a-0005 39.865500 45.154000 and they took a little while but sure enough some of that stuff is coming about uh
sw2538A-ms98-a-0006 45.154000 52.340375 so i don't know if that's going to be an ongoing trend that we're going to start helping this country and that country and breaking our own backs as it were
sw2538A-ms98-a-0007 52.340375 53.707125 what do you think
sw2538A-ms98-a-0008 53.707125 93.243875 [silence]
sw2538A-ms98-a-0009 93.243875 94.574125 um-hum

sw2538A-ms98-a-0013 127.128125 129.157750 yeah that's interesting
sw2538A-ms98-a-0014 129.157750 131.399250 [silence]
sw2538A-ms98-a-0015 131.399250 135.737250 yeah i think you're right i think over the well goodness i guess you could go back as
sw2538A-ms98-a-0016 135.737250 136.012500 [noise]
sw2538A-ms98-a-0017 136.012500 146.484250 far as Roosevelt and say that the social programs have certainly gone up and only economics have caused a few cutbacks but still the desire seems to be that the government s[ay]-
sw2538A-ms98-a-0018 146.484250 152.432000 or the norm has become that they would desire that the government say yeah that we deserve this so you will provide this
sw2538A-ms98-a-0019 152.432000 155.680375 this is part of the old happiness aspect
sw2538A-ms98-a-0020 155.680375 164.442625 that's a that's an interesting thought that they're headed to be a socialist and they're headed to be democratic and maybe we're capitalist and maybe the two will meet in the middle and and
sw2538A-ms98-a-0021 164.442625 166.595000 and agree i- i don't know
sw2538A-ms98-a-0022 166.595000 185.837000 [silence]
sw2538A-ms98-a-0023 185.837000 187.147375 um-hum
sw2538A-ms98-a-0024 187.147375 193.012875 [silence]
sw2538A-ms98-a-0025 193.012875 202.858250 right that does seem to be a problem that even the Poles faced when uh i think they're one of the earliest experimenters in in trying to get a capitalist uh economy going and
sw2538A-ms98-a-0026 202.858250 209.510625 some of the things that showed up is um i hate the term worth it work ethic but that seems to be the one that's tied to it
sw2538A-ms98-a-0027 209.510625 223.827000 that some of the Poles just didn't know what it meant to get up in the morning and you know be there and put in a few extra hours if it needed it or you know a little bit of work here and work there do what it takes instead of just stamp the clock stamp the clock and forget about it give me my paycheck
sw2538A-ms98-a-0028 223.827000 229.410000 um though there are jobs of course that exist that way here uh they don't
sw2538A-ms98-a-0029 229.410000 236.818500 they don't they're not labeled CEO [laughter] you know they're they're uh assembly line type jobs and
sw2538A-ms98-a-0030 236.818500 246.193750 they didn't have that worth it [ec/ethic] ethic and here we're headed towards socializing to the extent that there's a whole welfare population that doesn't have it
sw2538A-ms98-a-0031 246.193750 249.646625 so but that's an interesting uh
sw2538A-ms98-a-0032 249.646625 254.483750 merging as it were of the two ideas we're going one way and they're going the other

sw2538A-ms98-a-0040 317.540125 321.279625 i don't know if it'd be a political trend or not to
sw2538A-ms98-a-0041 321.279625 325.885375 to uh [noise] consider the problem of the 
sw2538A-ms98-a-0042 325.885375 337.179000 well i guess it it is a matter of uh at least the government's causing it there's there's so much more paperwork in most every job i mean the poor teacher can't get their jobs done for the reports and the things that the government requires and
sw2538A-ms98-a-0043 337.179000 344.132875 and uh the whole defense industry issue of having so many layers of management just to handle the paperwork and

sw2538A-ms98-a-0055 399.595125 407.275000 i wonder if they waive that when uh some of these horrendously large pileups occur in California like you hear these twenty and thirty pile
sw2538A-ms98-a-0056 407.275000 411.746250 boy couldn't you imagine doing the paperwork on that'd take an army of officers just to do the paperwork [laughter]
