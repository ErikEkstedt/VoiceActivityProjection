sw2538B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.966000 okay
sw2538B-ms98-a-0002 0.966000 27.874125 [silence]
sw2538B-ms98-a-0003 27.874125 28.689250 um-hum
sw2538B-ms98-a-0004 28.689250 52.659750 [silence]
sw2538B-ms98-a-0005 52.659750 66.136500 well i think that's uh a you know valid observation that uh anytime that a company that a country appears to be uh moving in the same direction that the United States
sw2538B-ms98-a-0006 66.136500 78.017750 uh thinks is the right direction that they tend to get more you know more uh more aid from from our government then they would have before or the other governments do
sw2538B-ms98-a-0007 78.017750 81.107250 um i suppose that's a
sw2538B-ms98-a-0008 81.107250 88.416875 uh as valid a way of determining who gets aid is as anything although i'm not sure that uh
sw2538B-ms98-a-0009 88.416875 93.764125 us giving aid is the right uh right thing for our government to be doing
sw2538B-ms98-a-0010 93.764125 97.596500 um i- i think it's kind of ironic that
sw2538B-ms98-a-0011 97.596500 110.682500 from my you know from my observation anyway that that we're uh rewarding other governments for becoming more democratic in following more capitalistic approaches
sw2538B-ms98-a-0012 110.682500 118.395875 whereas in our own economy the trend seems to be more towards social programs
sw2538B-ms98-a-0013 118.395875 127.441625 and you know away from the capitalistic approach so it's kind of like you know we're moving in the in a kind of a direction toward each other 
sw2538B-ms98-a-0014 127.441625 128.924375 [silence]
sw2538B-ms98-a-0015 128.924375 132.629750 uh you know i- i mean that's my own observation anyway
sw2538B-ms98-a-0016 132.629750 136.690000 [silence]
sw2538B-ms98-a-0017 136.690000 137.977250 right
sw2538B-ms98-a-0018 137.977250 140.424125 [silence]
sw2538B-ms98-a-0019 140.424125 141.920875 right yeah

sw2538B-ms98-a-0021 152.098750 153.493500 right

sw2538B-ms98-a-0025 166.226000 175.091875 and i'm not sure that uh that i would even think at this point that somewhere in the middle would even be desirable because uh i mean if there's if there's something
sw2538B-ms98-a-0026 175.091875 180.048250 uh if what we wind up with is more socialistic than what we have now
sw2538B-ms98-a-0027 180.048250 186.425250 then i'm not sure that it's the right thing it's there i think we have too much too many social programs
sw2538B-ms98-a-0028 186.425250 187.804750 uh
sw2538B-ms98-a-0029 187.804750 192.925500 it's a social programs without the corresponding responsibility
sw2538B-ms98-a-0030 192.925500 194.627125 i guess is
sw2538B-ms98-a-0031 194.627125 209.380375 [silence]

sw2538B-ms98-a-0042 245.605500 247.363625 right oh i
sw2538B-ms98-a-0043 247.363625 254.019250 [silence]
sw2538B-ms98-a-0044 254.019250 266.366625 i noticed in uh an article in the paper where i didn't read the whole article but you know the headlines anyway indicated that there's a a seems to be a consensus among small and medium size business owners
sw2538B-ms98-a-0045 266.366625 274.946250 that the uh the output of the American worker is on the decline you know pretty severely but uh
sw2538B-ms98-a-0046 274.946250 277.647875 the output's really suffering and i think that's
sw2538B-ms98-a-0047 277.647875 280.106500 you know that's another indication that
sw2538B-ms98-a-0048 280.106500 282.565125 that we're headed in the wrong direction
sw2538B-ms98-a-0049 282.565125 288.916625 uh you know and i think uh i think rewards for a job well done are are
sw2538B-ms98-a-0050 288.916625 292.930000 [vocalized-noise] are necessary and i- i think that we 
sw2538B-ms98-a-0051 292.930000 296.277500 i guess we have a tendency to
sw2538B-ms98-a-0052 296.277500 303.437375 as you know as managers of companies or owners of companies they have a tendency to try to get as much out of the employee
sw2538B-ms98-a-0053 303.437375 305.026000 as they can
sw2538B-ms98-a-0054 305.026000 307.483375 and not give as much as they can
sw2538B-ms98-a-0055 307.483375 309.653500 you know in return i
sw2538B-ms98-a-0056 309.653500 316.419250 uh i- i think that that there there needs to be some give and take in both you know on both sides of the
sw2538B-ms98-a-0057 316.419250 317.905375 of the picture there
sw2538B-ms98-a-0058 317.905375 333.461125 [silence]
sw2538B-ms98-a-0059 333.461125 334.636875 right

sw2538B-ms98-a-0063 343.647000 355.905750 well uh you know even the police uh have a lot of paperwork to do uh i observed a uh i didn't actually see the accident but uh the [vocalized-noise] the aftermath of a three car accident yesterday here in Richardson
sw2538B-ms98-a-0064 355.905750 365.153625 and i was going into the public library and apparently the accident had just you know recently happened then but there was a policeman there policewoman there
sw2538B-ms98-a-0065 365.153625 365.943625 uh
sw2538B-ms98-a-0066 365.943625 373.560250 taking down the information and i was in the library a good thirty minutes and came back out and she was still sitting in the police car there you know the accident
sw2538B-ms98-a-0067 373.560250 383.230000 participants were gone but she was sitting there filling out paperwork you know so you know it took her thirty minutes plus to to handle one traffic accident
sw2538B-ms98-a-0068 383.230000 385.055625 and uh [noise]

sw2538B-ms98-a-0071 385.977750 393.555000 and you know i think that's uh just a a kind of an indication the paperwork the the amount of information that the government wants
sw2538B-ms98-a-0072 393.555000 397.606875 even about a traffic [laughter-accident] you know is so much that uh
sw2538B-ms98-a-0073 397.606875 400.298250 you know we get bogged down and things like that
sw2538B-ms98-a-0074 400.298250 406.629875 [silence]
