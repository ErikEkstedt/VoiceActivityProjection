sw2523A-ms98-a-0006 15.780125 28.665875 [silence]
sw2523A-ms98-a-0007 28.665875 33.965000 well do you think there should be restrictions on uh who you should let in the states
sw2523A-ms98-a-0008 33.965000 37.335750 [silence]

sw2523A-ms98-a-0013 58.541750 66.854875 yeah that it it's really sad that uh but apparently they're they're i think there are some rules that won't let people in who have
sw2523A-ms98-a-0014 66.854875 81.990125 [silence]

sw2523A-ms98-a-0019 104.618000 116.238375 yeah that that can really be a problem i know in in in New York there's a problem with the Koreans that uh that that the uh black community is complaining that the Koreans are taking over
sw2523A-ms98-a-0020 116.238375 124.997875 [silence]
sw2523A-ms98-a-0021 124.997875 134.712625 well i have a friend that's married to a in fact he w[ent]- went to Korea and married a Korean and brought her home and uh
sw2523A-ms98-a-0022 134.712625 145.325500 the problem was that that she is a real hard worker and has started a a couple of businesses and now she's started a Korean health food store and
sw2523A-ms98-a-0023 145.325500 150.926125 she's really a go-getter that uh and she started off uh cleaning uh houses
sw2523A-ms98-a-0024 150.926125 165.473750 and uh then she found out that these automobile dealerships needed and so she got some people to help her and she had one and then she was doing a good job and she wound up having uh eight or ten automobile dealerships
sw2523A-ms98-a-0025 165.473750 168.262375 that she was cleaning and and
sw2523A-ms98-a-0026 168.262375 177.110250 apparently uh her her husband is sort of watching the money for her but apparently she's a really a hard worker and willing to do the hard work
sw2523A-ms98-a-0027 177.110250 187.813375 and has been able and now she's made enough money to start this health food store i don't know how she's doing but it i g[uess]- you have to admire the people who have come in and work and don't you know don't take money from the government
sw2523A-ms98-a-0028 187.813375 191.495750 [silence]

sw2523A-ms98-a-0033 211.102250 222.730750 well and the problem is that the jobs it's it's like the minimum wage everybody saying well i made the minimum wage but my so[n]- i have a seventeen year old son and he's saying well he'll go out and work at minimum wage
sw2523A-ms98-a-0034 222.730750 226.851750 well the problem is uh minimum wage is not enough to live on
sw2523A-ms98-a-0035 226.851750 241.453250 [silence]
sw2523A-ms98-a-0036 241.453250 242.828625 yeah

sw2523A-ms98-a-0038 245.275625 255.981125 no you do[n't]- and and and that's what i think is so sad about the whole uh proposition and if you've got all these people who come and work for for nothing and uh
sw2523A-ms98-a-0039 255.981125 259.329500 [silence]
sw2523A-ms98-a-0040 259.329500 260.660125 yeah

sw2523A-ms98-a-0050 318.506750 323.179750 well what about the what about the fact that it is right across the border in Mexico
sw2523A-ms98-a-0051 323.179750 324.656250 [silence]
sw2523A-ms98-a-0052 324.656250 326.990500 well you know i don't know if you know
sw2523A-ms98-a-0053 326.990500 328.839250 [silence]
sw2523A-ms98-a-0054 328.839250 337.304875 well but no i'm talking about the idea of the that the company set up uh factories right across the border Right across the Texas border in Mexico
sw2523A-ms98-a-0055 337.304875 344.386375 [silence]
sw2523A-ms98-a-0056 344.386375 354.282500 well you you you think you think that's worse than than having the Mexicans come across the border and work in the factory of the United States and take jobs away from Americans
sw2523A-ms98-a-0057 354.282500 361.607625 [silence]
sw2523A-ms98-a-0058 361.607625 372.786500 well but but what you think of the of of the big uh the big companies that uh that that set up factories in Mexico and basically move jobs out of the United States down to Mexico
sw2523A-ms98-a-0059 372.786500 379.965250 [silence]
sw2523A-ms98-a-0060 379.965250 382.763000 ye[ah]- yeah it's in [vocalized-noise]
sw2523A-ms98-a-0061 382.763000 392.266000 anyway but but do you think but the thing is d[own]- if they put a factory down there that means that there's more jobs for those people so they're not crossing the border you
sw2523A-ms98-a-0062 392.266000 412.116750 [silence]
sw2523A-ms98-a-0063 412.116750 417.714750 b[ut]- but do you think do you think that's why there's so many people that want to come to the United States because_1 of freedom or 
sw2523A-ms98-a-0064 417.714750 420.556125 do you think that's the main reason do you think the
sw2523A-ms98-a-0065 420.556125 425.537000 [silence]
sw2523A-ms98-a-0066 425.537000 428.640625 as opposed to well

sw2523A-ms98-a-0074 451.119500 462.862875 yeah but do you but th[e]- what about the d[o]- do you think that's fair for for people that come in here from say like the K[oreans]- i know i know a lot of Koreans that's why um and and you think it's fair
sw2523A-ms98-a-0075 462.862875 481.267750 [silence]
sw2523A-ms98-a-0076 481.267750 492.516750 well yeah we were yeah well we had uh we knew some Laotians and and uh the job they took uh you know basically are cleaning jobs

sw2523A-ms98-a-0091 535.090375 539.300750 and tha[t]- that's interesting they wou[ld]- i was reading something that said that they way
sw2523A-ms98-a-0092 539.300750 546.962375 [silence]
sw2523A-ms98-a-0093 546.962375 548.403125 yeah
sw2523A-ms98-a-0094 548.403125 562.618125 yeah what they were saying is that these uh people come in and they will uh they will uh live on say twenty percent of what they make and and they'll put four or five families in in one apartment
sw2523A-ms98-a-0095 562.618125 565.466000 and uh and

sw2523A-ms98-a-0101 577.462500 588.383750 no but the idea though is w[ell]- is if if you could put two or three families in a in a together they'd be a lot easier and apparently they all just save their money and and uh and buy a bunch of things
sw2523A-ms98-a-0102 588.383750 590.516875 [silence]
