sw2523B-ms98-a-0002 0.780875 2.932750 i'm fine [laughter]
sw2523B-ms98-a-0003 2.932750 4.268125 yes
sw2523B-ms98-a-0004 4.268125 9.073250 [silence]
sw2523B-ms98-a-0005 9.073250 12.337750 i guess [laughter] why
sw2523B-ms98-a-0006 12.337750 16.090125 [silence]
sw2523B-ms98-a-0007 16.090125 18.848875 it doesn't well to a point it's okay
sw2523B-ms98-a-0008 18.848875 21.260750 you know i don't mind
sw2523B-ms98-a-0009 21.260750 29.113000 i've never had a problem with them letting people in i just don't think that they they are right in some of the things they do
sw2523B-ms98-a-0010 29.113000 32.848875 [silence]
sw2523B-ms98-a-0011 32.848875 38.808875 no because then you get to the problem of then then you're not a free country anymore okay
sw2523B-ms98-a-0012 38.808875 42.510625 [silence]
sw2523B-ms98-a-0013 42.510625 54.816000 uh it doesn't matter everybody over here has got it anyway they're you know AIDS is AIDS as long as if they tell you before they come here that's fine you know that they got AIDS but then all you have to do is make sure they're not passing it around
sw2523B-ms98-a-0014 54.816000 59.545500 but then they don't know how it really you know to me they don't know nothing about AIDS anyway so
sw2523B-ms98-a-0015 59.545500 62.082375 that's just a different you know
sw2523B-ms98-a-0016 62.082375 65.810375 [silence]
sw2523B-ms98-a-0017 65.810375 72.996000 my my problem with immigration is when you take people that has been here on welfare or trying to make it
sw2523B-ms98-a-0018 72.996000 82.493250 and you know the united States gives people that come into the country more money to start their life than the people that's already here that's trying
sw2523B-ms98-a-0019 82.493250 89.132625 this is that's the only fallback i see because i've seen like when the Vietnamese come over they get they have stores
sw2523B-ms98-a-0020 89.132625 97.371500 and you know Uncle Sam done bought uh uh you know Uncle Sam had to pay for it they gave them that loan but people over here can't even get a small business loan like that
sw2523B-ms98-a-0021 97.371500 104.929750 it's harder for somebody from America to get a loan from their own country when a foreigner can get more and i don't think that's right
sw2523B-ms98-a-0022 104.929750 109.985250 [silence]
sw2523B-ms98-a-0023 109.985250 111.418750 um-hum

sw2523B-ms98-a-0025 115.801375 124.735250 what is the yeah that and then you have well then you have the well no Mexicans they they don't take over too much they just they just make more money
sw2523B-ms98-a-0026 124.735250 129.164375 [silence]
sw2523B-ms98-a-0027 129.164375 130.650375 um-hum

sw2523B-ms98-a-0029 133.341375 134.738125 that's a lot
sw2523B-ms98-a-0030 134.738125 135.947750 [laughter]
sw2523B-ms98-a-0031 135.947750 141.412750 [silence]
sw2523B-ms98-a-0032 141.412750 142.716625 yeah

sw2523B-ms98-a-0039 177.784000 187.239125 [silence]
sw2523B-ms98-a-0040 187.239125 199.997875 yeah now that's all right i don't mind people that work for what they do i give them a and if and if they work so hard and then ge[t]- give them a small that's fine i just don't think that the handouts are equal
sw2523B-ms98-a-0041 199.997875 212.403125 okay that's what i'm saying there there's so much problem with the handouts and then now by the economy being like it is this is the worst time they could have for everybody coming into the United States
sw2523B-ms98-a-0042 212.403125 226.096000 [silence]
sw2523B-ms98-a-0043 226.096000 237.838500 no it's not and if it's uh it's just like my husband well we was talking about it before he sold his truck he was a truck driver now for him to actually make money
sw2523B-ms98-a-0044 237.838500 242.304625 he would have to make almost nine dollars a hour that's just to live
sw2523B-ms98-a-0045 242.304625 246.197250 okay but you can't find no jobs like that
sw2523B-ms98-a-0046 246.197250 248.003750 okay
sw2523B-ms98-a-0047 248.003750 252.979875 [silence]
sw2523B-ms98-a-0048 252.979875 260.412125 for nothing that's where you problem comes in is because some people will work for nothing when other people won't
sw2523B-ms98-a-0049 260.412125 267.804750 and then that's why you have y[our]- i think that's where the the the line is even in Ja[pan]- in Japan though it's the same way
sw2523B-ms98-a-0050 267.804750 272.034000 they have their their economy is booming because of the United States
sw2523B-ms98-a-0051 272.034000 284.178875 if you don't understand that and i- i- i sit and i think about it but the the car the car market over th[e]- the automobile industry you know it's been the United States for so long and the last
sw2523B-ms98-a-0052 284.178875 288.141250 fifteen twenty years the Japanese have just taken over
sw2523B-ms98-a-0053 288.141250 290.998750 [silence]
sw2523B-ms98-a-0054 290.998750 304.239250 i think it has a lot to do with the price of a car and how much see to me they people don't look at it but if you take a Japanese car and bring it over here they sell it for the same amount of American car
sw2523B-ms98-a-0055 304.239250 309.615500 okay if you take an American car and take it to Japan you can't even har[dly]- you couldn't afford it
sw2523B-ms98-a-0056 309.615500 319.528125 so our our import tax on them is no big deal but their their tax on us and you can't you can't do that plus they can make it cheaper because they don't pay that much
sw2523B-ms98-a-0057 319.528125 323.623875 [silence]
sw2523B-ms98-a-0058 323.623875 325.502875 the what is
sw2523B-ms98-a-0059 325.502875 329.528875 i don't i don't like the idea of th[e]- illegal aliens
sw2523B-ms98-a-0060 329.528875 330.827375 i don't 
sw2523B-ms98-a-0061 330.827375 335.664875 [silence]
sw2523B-ms98-a-0062 335.664875 344.430500 oh that's just that's just so that the uh now see they made more money down there and they got real cheap labor in Mexico
sw2523B-ms98-a-0063 344.430500 353.756125 [silence]
sw2523B-ms98-a-0064 353.756125 354.834250 yeah 
sw2523B-ms98-a-0065 354.834250 362.408875 i no i think it would be better if they would stay down there and get right papers to come across the border 
sw2523B-ms98-a-0066 362.408875 372.269375 [silence]
sw2523B-ms98-a-0067 372.269375 380.949250 well there's a lot of companies TI do that TI got companies in Mexico i don't if it's in Mexico Mexico but they got them in in foreign countries
sw2523B-ms98-a-0068 380.949250 382.066625 [silence]
sw2523B-ms98-a-0069 382.066625 385.158875 you know so but bu[t]-
sw2523B-ms98-a-0070 385.158875 391.215875 [silence]
sw2523B-ms98-a-0071 391.215875 392.874500 as much
sw2523B-ms98-a-0072 392.874500 405.395000 but some of them_1 are still crossing not because of i know a lot of times i don't think it's just because of the money i think it's because they don't they the the the country themselves
sw2523B-ms98-a-0073 405.395000 408.786625 you know like the government should i say
sw2523B-ms98-a-0074 408.786625 412.860000 because everybody's not free to do what they want to do in every country
sw2523B-ms98-a-0075 412.860000 416.766625 [silence]
sw2523B-ms98-a-0076 416.766625 418.015250 yeah
sw2523B-ms98-a-0077 418.015250 420.109625 [silence]
sw2523B-ms98-a-0078 420.109625 425.046375 i think it's freedom and the and and to and the right to do what you want to do
sw2523B-ms98-a-0079 425.046375 427.286500 [silence]
sw2523B-ms98-a-0080 427.286500 434.032625 doing what the government wants you to do or been doing the government thinks you're able to do so it's the same thing
sw2523B-ms98-a-0081 434.032625 438.544875 and the government forcing you or taking more of your money than you want to give them_1
sw2523B-ms98-a-0082 438.544875 447.947750 because_1 i can make a million dollars and i know exactly Uncle Sam can't take half my money they can take [noise] whatever the percentage is for that amount you know
sw2523B-ms98-a-0083 447.947750 448.963250 [silence]
sw2523B-ms98-a-0084 448.963250 450.443875 that's it
sw2523B-ms98-a-0085 450.443875 459.735500 [silence]
sw2523B-ms98-a-0086 459.735500 461.287750 um-hum
sw2523B-ms98-a-0087 461.287750 468.239750 the only thing about a Korean or th[e]- or the Vietnamese that like i said i don't like is
sw2523B-ms98-a-0088 468.239750 480.777500 the idea like i said is i don't mind them because_1 they can do anything they want to do and as long as they don't take jobs but see a lot of the jobs they're taking people don't realize nobody else wants
sw2523B-ms98-a-0089 480.777500 482.093625 [silence]
sw2523B-ms98-a-0090 482.093625 483.775500 you see what i'm saying
sw2523B-ms98-a-0091 483.775500 491.933500 [silence]
sw2523B-ms98-a-0092 491.933500 493.203625 um-hum
sw2523B-ms98-a-0093 493.203625 497.501500 [silence]
sw2523B-ms98-a-0094 497.501500 498.882750 um-hum
sw2523B-ms98-a-0095 498.882750 501.727500 [silence]
sw2523B-ms98-a-0096 501.727500 506.942375 but see just like her Korean food store okay that's mostly for Koreans
sw2523B-ms98-a-0097 506.942375 514.281250 and that's just like over here on on on Walnut and uh Plano Road or is it Jupiter one of them streets anyway
sw2523B-ms98-a-0098 514.281250 521.113000 that whole section is nothing but but like Chinese or or K[orean]- foreign i don't what it is [laughter]
sw2523B-ms98-a-0099 521.113000 522.404375 okay
sw2523B-ms98-a-0100 522.404375 525.841250 and that's because they cater to their own people
sw2523B-ms98-a-0101 525.841250 535.678125 which people don't realize it but there is a lot of them_1 here and that way they can make money because they make money and then they put it right back into to somebody elses business
sw2523B-ms98-a-0102 535.678125 537.100875 [silence]
sw2523B-ms98-a-0103 537.100875 550.205500 and and there that is wrong with America people don't put they money back into the same thing that's why Americans buy for[eign]- if Americans would buy American cars we wouldn't have to worry about none of this
sw2523B-ms98-a-0104 550.205500 561.823375 [silence]
sw2523B-ms98-a-0105 561.823375 563.446875 yeah
sw2523B-ms98-a-0106 563.446875 571.934250 but see some people you can't do that to some apartments won't let you do that and then a lot of people you can't like i don't think i could live with my sister
sw2523B-ms98-a-0107 571.934250 578.242625 okay families American families don't get along that good enough to stick together
sw2523B-ms98-a-0108 578.242625 584.918000 [silence]
sw2523B-ms98-a-0109 584.918000 586.348625 that's right
sw2523B-ms98-a-0110 586.348625 593.468875 that's why now that works if you can find somebody to do it with but it's very rare that you can [laughter-find] somebody to do it with
sw2523B-ms98-a-0111 593.468875 595.726750 [silence]
