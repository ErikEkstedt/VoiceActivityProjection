sw2556B-ms98-a-0006 26.010125 37.071625 there have like big oak trees in the front and so the grass is not growing out underneath the oak trees so i'm have to get out there and do something about that you know spread some seed and fertilizer and stuff

sw2556B-ms98-a-0021 75.828250 78.698250 [silence]
sw2556B-ms98-a-0022 78.698250 80.977875 hm that's an idea
sw2556B-ms98-a-0023 80.977875 82.097500 [silence]
sw2556B-ms98-a-0024 82.097500 83.436875 um-hum
sw2556B-ms98-a-0025 83.436875 85.526500 [silence]
sw2556B-ms98-a-0026 85.526500 93.723375 [laughter-yeah] that's true that's true yeah i have um in between the street and the sidewalk see are two of the oak trees
sw2556B-ms98-a-0027 93.723375 105.185750 and then there's one uh sitting on the r[ight]- uh facing the house on the right hand side in the middle of that whole section and then i have this whole section over there that has nothing in it at all but jus[t]- just the grass
sw2556B-ms98-a-0028 105.185750 118.115125 so that may be an idea to do is uh because_1 i've got that concentration of trees right there is to uh you know just do something like what you said was to put some kind of um uh little plants that does well in shade uh the shaded area
sw2556B-ms98-a-0029 118.115125 121.968375 and forget about you know trying to plant grass and stuff underneath that
sw2556B-ms98-a-0030 121.968375 132.616500 the other thing too is that the oak trees have those acorns and i don't know if i'm uh going to have to go out there and if i can rake those up or if i'm going to have to pick them all up by hand or what
sw2556B-ms98-a-0031 132.616500 134.617875 [silence]
sw2556B-ms98-a-0032 134.617875 149.542375 [laughter] well i know but if you saw how many acorns were [laughter-sitting] [laughter-up] [laughter-under] [laughter-there] [laughter-you'd] [laughter-see] it looks like an impossible [laughter-task] [laughter] but we have um um Texas has a lot of the um uh wooden fenced in back yards
sw2556B-ms98-a-0033 149.542375 161.480250 for privacy fence so i did buy a a weed eater too and uh so i could get you know around uh around the wooden fences and um uh you know get all the weeds and stuff up out of there

sw2556B-ms98-a-0052 225.925000 227.442625 who was it

sw2556B-ms98-a-0054 229.748375 234.502000 [silence]
sw2556B-ms98-a-0055 234.502000 235.743000 huh
sw2556B-ms98-a-0056 235.743000 240.537250 [silence]
sw2556B-ms98-a-0057 240.537250 250.939250 uh-huh ooh that'd be good [laughter-i] [laughter-think] [laughter-that's] that's my problem is i i couldn't believe uh uh because_1 uh i guess the other people they weren't really outdoor type people because the lawn really needs to be
sw2556B-ms98-a-0058 250.939250 257.199750 i have uh bushes and stuff that really need trimming and um so uh
sw2556B-ms98-a-0059 257.199750 265.239125 so i'm just thinking how in the world i was going to have to scrape up all those uh acorns that are sitting out there they even have some little trees growing
sw2556B-ms98-a-0060 265.239125 272.599125 because they just left them the acorns i guess sit rather than raking them up um so you know i'm going to have to get out there and 
sw2556B-ms98-a-0061 272.599125 284.672875 but it was interesting i had to go buy a hoe and a rake i mean the whole works because i've i've lived in an apartment for so long i've never had that kind of equipment so that was that was interesting to go down there and and get all that kind of stuff
sw2556B-ms98-a-0062 284.672875 287.302875 [silence]
sw2556B-ms98-a-0063 287.302875 288.702500 yeah
sw2556B-ms98-a-0064 288.702500 290.707625 [silence]
sw2556B-ms98-a-0065 290.707625 295.960125 right right so this has been uh this has been an experience for me
sw2556B-ms98-a-0066 295.960125 305.013250 and uh uh but i i can't wait until we have uh uh some more time to get out there in the front yard and and really do uh you know a lot of landscaping
sw2556B-ms98-a-0067 305.013250 311.555000 because_1 i want to cut down all the the trees that they or the little shrubs that they have because_1 some of them_1 are like um
sw2556B-ms98-a-0068 311.555000 318.075750 they have the new uh green leaves i don't if it's getting green up there where you are uh but they're almost fully
sw2556B-ms98-a-0069 318.075750 325.509250 blossomed and but there are like sides of them_1 where there're like whole dead uh portions of the shrubs
sw2556B-ms98-a-0070 325.509250 336.394375 and uh so i've been debating of whether or not just to cut out the dead portions or you know just to take it all out and i think i've pretty well [laughter-decided] just to take it all out and start all over again
sw2556B-ms98-a-0071 336.394375 338.592000 [silence]
sw2556B-ms98-a-0072 338.592000 347.551875 [laughter] i'm just going to get the little baby [laughter-shrubs] [laughter] the little baby ones you know take several years to grow [laughter] there um
sw2556B-ms98-a-0073 347.551875 355.870875 well it's not too bad i mean i- i- i thought they were pretty reasonable but i don't know i have nothing really to compare it with uh you know four or five dollars for a for a shrub
sw2556B-ms98-a-0074 355.870875 362.327875 i don't know and uh i hadn't really wanted to get that many you know to put out there i i much prefer flowers

sw2556B-ms98-a-0085 385.439500 399.688250 you know a[nd]- an[d]- and i didn't blink an eyelash that's what got to me [laughter-when] [laughter-the] [laughter-man] you know said and that'll be five hundred and something dollars you know with my my big new lawn mower and stuff i was just okay [laughter-you] [laughter-know] so yeah you're right you're right you can i think you can go through quite a bit of money
sw2556B-ms98-a-0086 399.688250 408.617500 i think it depends too where you buy it from if you buy it from a nursery or um we have like Home Depot here i don't know if you have that there is
