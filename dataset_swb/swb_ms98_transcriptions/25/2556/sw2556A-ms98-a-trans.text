sw2556A-ms98-a-0003 5.091625 16.332125 [silence]

sw2556A-ms98-a-0005 19.437500 27.915375 [silence]
sw2556A-ms98-a-0006 27.915375 29.229250 um-hum
sw2556A-ms98-a-0007 29.229250 36.547625 [silence]
sw2556A-ms98-a-0008 36.547625 38.304875 okay_1 i think one of the
sw2556A-ms98-a-0009 38.304875 46.719250 some of the problems with uh oak trees is their leaves tend to accumulate and they leach a lot of acid into the soil
sw2556A-ms98-a-0010 46.719250 52.092000 so i found that when i had a uh wooded lot that i needed to put a lot of lime out
sw2556A-ms98-a-0011 52.092000 57.000875 to uh neutralize the uh the acid from the uh oak leaves
sw2556A-ms98-a-0012 57.000875 63.548000 but there's still a problem that uh the shade from the trees just uh grass cannot grow
sw2556A-ms98-a-0013 63.548000 74.516625 and uh one of the things that uh we did uh just we sort of made a little garden that uh surrounded the trees and planted uh pachysandra
sw2556A-ms98-a-0014 74.516625 79.797750 which is a a shade plant that seems to do well underneath the trees
sw2556A-ms98-a-0015 79.797750 87.525000 yeah so that saved the bare spots and uh you know also eliminated mowing the uh that area of the [laughter-lawn]

sw2556A-ms98-a-0021 131.808625 135.185750 i don't think there's it's it's an impossible task

sw2556A-ms98-a-0027 161.962750 167.157500 well one of the things you may need come fall is a leaf blower or a leaf vacuum
sw2556A-ms98-a-0028 167.157500 176.289250 because_1 i've you know my wooded lot at my previous house uh i didn't have to mow the lawn very often because it didn't grow that fast
sw2556A-ms98-a-0029 176.289250 183.783125 but in the fall i had to spend a couple of weekends out there on you know two separate weekends just getting rid of leaves
sw2556A-ms98-a-0030 183.783125 187.707500 [silence]
sw2556A-ms98-a-0031 187.707500 192.161625 well i had a a leaf vacuum to pick them up and uh
sw2556A-ms98-a-0032 192.161625 201.436375 in the front yard i would uh just drive up to the curb and drop them at the curb the uh county had a pickup service for leaves dropped at the curb
sw2556A-ms98-a-0033 201.436375 209.913250 and for the back i would uh vacuum them up and then put them_1 on a tarp and drag the tarp out front to to dump them_1
sw2556A-ms98-a-0034 209.913250 213.642000 and springtime you have to use bags to pack them_1
sw2556A-ms98-a-0035 213.642000 220.942375 [silence]
sw2556A-ms98-a-0036 220.942375 229.024250 yeah well uh Craftsman put out a uh leaf vacuum a few years back craftsman Sears and Roebuck
sw2556A-ms98-a-0037 229.024250 234.987875 and uh i think it was about two hundred dollars or something like that it was a very powerful machine
sw2556A-ms98-a-0038 234.987875 241.391750 and it would have a tendency to pick up some of the uh acorns if they didn't get uh pressed into the ground
