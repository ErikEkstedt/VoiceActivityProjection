sw2509A-ms98-a-0018 68.064125 70.739500 [silence]
sw2509A-ms98-a-0019 70.739500 78.221875 well i do i enjoy going to the movies and i tell you i've try to there we have a dollar theater i don't know where d[o]- are you in Dallas or
sw2509A-ms98-a-0020 78.221875 80.601000 okay well i li[ve]- in Carrollton
sw2509A-ms98-a-0021 80.601000 85.844875 and there's a new dollar theater that's real nice and so uh [noise] 
sw2509A-ms98-a-0022 85.844875 91.888500 see i took him and a friend t[o]- to see uh Kindergarten Cop a couple of weeks ago
sw2509A-ms98-a-0023 91.888500 97.942750 you know i[t]- it was so uninteresting that i don't even [laughter-remember] [laughter-what] [laughter-it] [laughter-was] [laughter-about] 
sw2509A-ms98-a-0024 97.942750 106.522375 the the kids seemed to enjoy it and then uh let's see uh bef[ore]- the week before that i took them to see Look Who's Talking Too which was just awful
sw2509A-ms98-a-0025 106.522375 110.918500 mean even the do[llar]- it wasn't even worth a dollar [laughter] 
sw2509A-ms98-a-0026 110.918500 117.852250 uh the first one was much much better i in fact i enjoyed -[en]joyed the first one Look Who's Talking
sw2509A-ms98-a-0027 117.852250 121.188125 [silence]
sw2509A-ms98-a-0028 121.188125 133.219750 but the second one's just it's more it really hardly has anything to do with the kids it's more about their relationship and they're just always fighting and they break up and they you know get back typical you know
sw2509A-ms98-a-0029 133.219750 136.111500 typical [laughter-plot]
sw2509A-ms98-a-0030 136.111500 146.497625 so but i was real disappointed in that and then Kindergarten Cop like i said i you know i just i don't even remember it [laughter] my mind must have just been somewhere else so
sw2509A-ms98-a-0031 146.497625 149.763500 [silence]
