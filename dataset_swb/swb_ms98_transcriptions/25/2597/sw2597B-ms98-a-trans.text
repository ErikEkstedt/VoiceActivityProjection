sw2597B-ms98-a-0002 1.845375 13.986750 well this is a good subject isn't it it it's something that you can really talk about um i don't know what we're going to do about it but it's certainly something that has a lot of things to talk about
sw2597B-ms98-a-0003 13.986750 15.449250 um
sw2597B-ms98-a-0004 15.449250 22.055375 you know when they say the Middle East it's such a big area and there's so many different problems there
sw2597B-ms98-a-0005 22.055375 25.005750 um what do you want to concentrate on
sw2597B-ms98-a-0006 25.005750 26.056875 [silence]
sw2597B-ms98-a-0007 26.056875 32.517625 well um i'll tell you something um i i have a sister-in-law from Israel
sw2597B-ms98-a-0008 32.517625 35.621000 and and they're really quite um
sw2597B-ms98-a-0009 35.621000 42.286750 arrogant about it all they they believe that they they belong there and they've belonged there forever and
sw2597B-ms98-a-0010 42.286750 45.451250 the Palestinians and the Arabs are
sw2597B-ms98-a-0011 45.451250 49.970875 um more or less th[ey]- they they consider them second class
sw2597B-ms98-a-0012 49.970875 54.399625 so they're really quite arrogant about it i don't uh
sw2597B-ms98-a-0013 54.399625 57.061500 i don't know if that contributes to the problem
sw2597B-ms98-a-0014 57.061500 63.535750 [silence]
sw2597B-ms98-a-0015 63.535750 71.643875 oh uh i'm sure i'm sure i[t]- this is the one time that the Israelis are really happy to have their big brothers the Americans
sw2597B-ms98-a-0016 71.643875 79.163500 but i didn't really talk about that with her she um um my sister-in-law now lives in um Switzerland
sw2597B-ms98-a-0017 79.163500 83.326375 but um when they were living in Israel it was
sw2597B-ms98-a-0018 83.326375 87.603250 it was the the Palestinians they they come in
sw2597B-ms98-a-0019 87.603250 95.253125 and they're they're nothing but really servants for them a[nd]- and they really treat them_1 like second class citizens
sw2597B-ms98-a-0020 95.253125 106.791250 they they don't really want them around but they like them around because they do all the menial labor and such but they they really do they look down on them and
sw2597B-ms98-a-0021 106.791250 114.614375 i don't know being i i live in uh Vermont and being up here we pretty much treat everybody
sw2597B-ms98-a-0022 114.614375 123.594375 you know as someone that has merit even if they are poor or if they're Hispanic or if they're Black we give everybody pretty much the benefit of the doubt
sw2597B-ms98-a-0023 123.594375 131.173250 because we don't see all the crime and all the hurt in the big cities you know i[f]-
sw2597B-ms98-a-0024 131.173250 139.192375 uh i[f]- if i lived in Washington DC i think i'd have a different attitude about Black people because i've heard that it it the
sw2597B-ms98-a-0025 139.192375 143.836750 they're terrible you know it's just like it's a dog eat dog world

sw2597B-ms98-a-0037 213.464500 214.612000 [silence]
sw2597B-ms98-a-0038 214.612000 218.002750 [laughter-no] huh there's a lot of crime

sw2597B-ms98-a-0040 220.683750 227.853000 yeah like i uh we're we're so protected up here it's it's really strange i mean our red light district
sw2597B-ms98-a-0041 227.853000 236.888500 i mean uh you could go walking around down there and pretty much not fear for your life you know and we're just so protected
sw2597B-ms98-a-0042 236.888500 238.379375 but
sw2597B-ms98-a-0043 238.379375 240.112375 i[t's]- it's it's
sw2597B-ms98-a-0044 240.112375 249.934500 over in the Mid East especially Israel it's just like Israelis have a like a totalitarian system when it comes to the Palestinians
sw2597B-ms98-a-0045 249.934500 254.777250 you know the Israelis can do anything they want but when it comes to Palestinians
sw2597B-ms98-a-0046 254.777250 259.862375 if they're out in the street at night it's it's really looked on as odd
sw2597B-ms98-a-0047 259.862375 270.781875 um usually they're they're bussed in to the the um Jewish neighborhoods and Jewish cities and then at night they're bussed out to the occupied territories
sw2597B-ms98-a-0048 270.781875 273.793250 so they don't have that but um
sw2597B-ms98-a-0049 273.793250 278.024125 w[hat]- what do you think about the mess that's we've created in Iraq
sw2597B-ms98-a-0050 278.024125 285.445125 [silence]
sw2597B-ms98-a-0051 285.445125 293.584875 it's just what do you do for them_1 you want to do something for them_1 but you don't want to get so directly involved that you're occupying the the country
sw2597B-ms98-a-0052 293.584875 301.354750 [silence]
sw2597B-ms98-a-0053 301.354750 310.836250 to do it yeah but you see President Bush is telling them rebel you know um u[prise]- uprise and that's what they did
sw2597B-ms98-a-0054 310.836250 314.240625 and now they're like asking him for help
sw2597B-ms98-a-0055 314.240625 324.424000 and he's like no we can't get involved wh[at]- what my husband had very strong feelings he he he he uh agreed with um the General Schwartzkopf
sw2597B-ms98-a-0056 324.424000 330.041750 he said um that he should have let th[at]- Bush should have let him finish his job
sw2597B-ms98-a-0057 330.041750 335.334875 he should've l[et]- he should've let them_1 um corner the Republican Guards
sw2597B-ms98-a-0058 335.334875 336.602125 [silence]
sw2597B-ms98-a-0059 336.602125 339.654125 yeah exactly that's what everyone says
sw2597B-ms98-a-0060 339.654125 343.843125 e[veryone]- everyone i talk to they say you know it's real easy to say that
sw2597B-ms98-a-0061 343.843125 349.571875 [silence]
sw2597B-ms98-a-0062 349.571875 361.208375 yeah i don't think the higher ups were thinking about wh[at]- what this guy's going to do with the rest of his war machine they're going oh well it's not going to hurt us so we're just going to let them go
sw2597B-ms98-a-0063 361.208375 365.209500 but really we didn't think about the people that he was going to
sw2597B-ms98-a-0064 365.209500 367.448875 tr[y]- and i mean he he's just
sw2597B-ms98-a-0065 367.448875 373.617875 [silence]
sw2597B-ms98-a-0066 373.617875 386.681750 they yeah they they did they stuck right to their goals and right what they were going to say and the American people when this first started they were even reluctant to let them do that so they were they were playing it very safe but
sw2597B-ms98-a-0067 386.681750 394.526875 you know it an ounce do they say an ounce of hind sight is worth you know wh[atever]- whatever th[ey]- they 
sw2597B-ms98-a-0068 394.526875 407.445500 i don't know they it Schwartz[kopf]- Schwartzkopf knew what had to be done and it's too bad that he just didn't have the ability just to do it to you know the uh the go ahead to do it
sw2597B-ms98-a-0069 407.445500 416.358750 because_1 he had the few he knew what was going to happen more than any of us because_1 i didn't realize that um it was going to make such a mess
sw2597B-ms98-a-0070 416.358750 425.012875 i mean i feel really sorry for these people these people are middle class people just like us can you imagine if someone started bombing your neighborhood and
sw2597B-ms98-a-0071 425.012875 435.283375 and you knew this these people are going to come and if you were in your house they were going to take you and beat you of course you're gonna just gonna pick everything up that you can carry and you're going to run
sw2597B-ms98-a-0072 435.283375 440.083250 and it it's just too bad that we couldn't see that
sw2597B-ms98-a-0073 440.083250 448.367625 [silence]
sw2597B-ms98-a-0074 448.367625 456.755500 well you know what i was hoping i was hoping Iran was going to take a very um dramatic stand and invade
sw2597B-ms98-a-0075 456.755500 464.183875 you know and and like Iran's the big bad guy you know but really if if they were going to save people's lives

sw2597B-ms98-a-0077 467.062125 472.275250 yeah i [laughter-know] it's like they were using them as friends
sw2597B-ms98-a-0078 472.275250 477.488375 when we were having the conflict but i i you know it's almost where
sw2597B-ms98-a-0079 477.488375 490.411375 i'm kind of disappointed with the Iranians why they didn't go s[ave]- save i mean i don't know if the Kurdish i know the Shiite's are their people but i don't know i think they have a bond with the the Kurds
sw2597B-ms98-a-0080 490.411375 491.743375 [silence]
sw2597B-ms98-a-0081 491.743375 495.206375 yeah i i think they should have just done more
sw2597B-ms98-a-0082 495.206375 502.928000 uh and maybe if the world could have given them some type of aid i[t's]- it's just so complicated
sw2597B-ms98-a-0083 502.928000 507.352625 [silence]
sw2597B-ms98-a-0084 507.352625 520.107750 oh yeah well y[ou]- knowing them they're very um oh i don't know almost compare them_1 to a very egotistical man well damn right i'm going to protect my family you know so
