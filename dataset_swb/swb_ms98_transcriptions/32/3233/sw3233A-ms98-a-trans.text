sw3233A-ms98-a-0002 0.516625 9.414875 okay [noise] well uh some of the books i've read lately have to do with crafty type things where i've
sw3233A-ms98-a-0003 9.414875 14.445375 where i've um learned things that i'm going to do for my children for Christmas
sw3233A-ms98-a-0004 14.445375 17.912250 and they were really uh helpful
sw3233A-ms98-a-0005 17.912250 21.215375 because i didn't know how to do this one stitching
sw3233A-ms98-a-0006 21.215375 26.146750 and so that was very helpful to me as far as books otherwise
sw3233A-ms98-a-0007 26.146750 29.605750 um i like to read children's books
sw3233A-ms98-a-0008 29.605750 32.880250 [noise] and things like that [vocalized-noise] what about you 
sw3233A-ms98-a-0009 32.880250 36.489625 [silence]
sw3233A-ms98-a-0010 36.489625 38.110625 oh
sw3233A-ms98-a-0011 38.110625 46.503750 [silence]

sw3233A-ms98-a-0013 48.001000 58.866250 [silence]
sw3233A-ms98-a-0014 58.866250 60.133250 uh-huh
sw3233A-ms98-a-0015 60.133250 65.448250 [silence]
sw3233A-ms98-a-0016 65.448250 66.683875 oh
sw3233A-ms98-a-0017 66.683875 76.300625 [silence]
sw3233A-ms98-a-0018 76.300625 85.987875 uh-huh it's interesting that you said that my husband and i had uh took a book out of the library about gardening too and started a garden a fall garden
sw3233A-ms98-a-0019 85.987875 88.052250 um w[ith]-
sw3233A-ms98-a-0020 88.052250 96.106875 oh [laughter] yeah and our our uh cantaloupes and and um peppers and tomatoes are on right now
sw3233A-ms98-a-0021 96.106875 105.524000 so it's been really fun and and we learned that [vocalized-noise] you know um some of the gardening skills we had were before but some of them we learned from a book 
sw3233A-ms98-a-0022 105.524000 110.363500 and so that was helpful to us now i've read two books
sw3233A-ms98-a-0023 110.363500 117.454875 uh that were uh nonfiction lately and uh
sw3233A-ms98-a-0024 117.454875 118.861375 i
sw3233A-ms98-a-0025 118.861375 122.218375 well one was nonfiction and one was fiction
sw3233A-ms98-a-0026 122.218375 130.533875 and the fiction one uh was about a boy in uh during the time of Adolf Hitler
sw3233A-ms98-a-0027 130.533875 135.476750 and he grew up and lived through a concentration camp
sw3233A-ms98-a-0028 135.476750 143.745500 and that was not enjoyment [laughter] that that was too realistic and really um mind
sw3233A-ms98-a-0029 143.745500 148.864625 a real eye opener [noise] uh and i guess it's good to read those things too
sw3233A-ms98-a-0030 148.864625 152.974375 uh but i didn't enjoy it necessarily
sw3233A-ms98-a-0031 152.974375 157.785625 and uh the other one was quite enjoyable it was uh about a
sw3233A-ms98-a-0032 157.785625 164.737625 a Chinese lady and her generations down her what happened to her family through the years
sw3233A-ms98-a-0033 164.737625 174.260375 so that one was good i think all of uh well even if they're not enjoyable they bring you uh a some kind of of learning
sw3233A-ms98-a-0034 174.260375 179.805875 so even if it's the country that they're from or anything like that
sw3233A-ms98-a-0035 179.805875 181.443875 so i
sw3233A-ms98-a-0036 181.443875 190.016875 i- i like to read the the children's books i think that's the most animated and imaginative so i like those a lot
sw3233A-ms98-a-0037 190.016875 192.268875 [silence]
sw3233A-ms98-a-0038 192.268875 202.880375 [noise] oh there are a couple of Newbery Award winners uh A Wrinkle in Time is one [noise] and i don't know if you've ever read that but but um
sw3233A-ms98-a-0039 202.880375 207.563000 [noise] oh there's one about an Indian girl and i can't think of that
sw3233A-ms98-a-0040 207.563000 210.800000 Island of the Blue Dolphins is another
sw3233A-ms98-a-0041 210.800000 212.864125 and that's a good one
sw3233A-ms98-a-0042 212.864125 220.242500 now some of the ones that have just received the awards this year i haven't read and i would like to read those
sw3233A-ms98-a-0043 220.242500 227.483250 but uh it's funny because_1 i've read some from like nineteen twenty three and nineteen forty five and things like that
sw3233A-ms98-a-0044 227.483250 237.012875 and i didn't enjoy those as much and i don't know if it's just because they didn't come from my era or what but uh
sw3233A-ms98-a-0045 237.012875 242.039375 [silence]

sw3233A-ms98-a-0057 273.184375 276.844750 to bed at night and there was one called The Pig Princess
sw3233A-ms98-a-0058 276.844750 287.994500 and it was a a princess from a long long time ago and she came through a a spell kind of thing and ended up in a pig um sty and the people that she came to were just
sw3233A-ms98-a-0059 287.994500 296.222750 farm people and she didn't understand them and they didn't understand her but it came together in this book and it was really a lot of fun
sw3233A-ms98-a-0060 296.222750 298.626000 [silence]
