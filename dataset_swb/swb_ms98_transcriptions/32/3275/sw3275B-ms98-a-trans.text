sw3275B-ms98-a-0015 45.500250 50.929000 [silence]
sw3275B-ms98-a-0016 50.929000 52.288750 yeah
sw3275B-ms98-a-0017 52.288750 54.106375 that's a good idea
sw3275B-ms98-a-0018 54.106375 57.068500 stops all them interest rates and interest rates aren't
sw3275B-ms98-a-0019 57.068500 59.480250 none too shallow these days anyway
sw3275B-ms98-a-0020 59.480250 67.444000 [noise] but i know a lot of people that get in trouble with them_1 especially you know we have i'm in Lubbock and we have a bunch of college kids around here going to Tech [noise] 
sw3275B-ms98-a-0021 67.444000 70.426375 and they seem to get in trouble with them_1 a lot
sw3275B-ms98-a-0022 70.426375 75.148125 [silence]
sw3275B-ms98-a-0023 75.148125 76.770250 [noise] yeah

sw3275B-ms98-a-0026 87.326250 98.582875 [silence]
sw3275B-ms98-a-0027 98.582875 100.322875 yeah something like that 
sw3275B-ms98-a-0028 100.322875 101.729875 [silence]
sw3275B-ms98-a-0029 101.729875 103.020250 yeah
sw3275B-ms98-a-0030 103.020250 106.036625 [silence]
sw3275B-ms98-a-0031 106.036625 109.591125 [noise] well my wife got in trouble one time with hers and 
sw3275B-ms98-a-0032 109.591125 111.920500 she was making like
sw3275B-ms98-a-0033 111.920500 115.663875 i don't know what she was making forty five dollars a month i think
sw3275B-ms98-a-0034 115.663875 123.454750 and fifteen dollars of it was because she was over the limit and fifteen dollars of it was interest so she was only paying in it fifteen dollars a month
sw3275B-ms98-a-0035 123.454750 124.633625 [silence]
sw3275B-ms98-a-0036 124.633625 129.000875 [noise] so and that was before we got married so [noise] 
sw3275B-ms98-a-0037 129.000875 133.139875 but it's you know we sat down and talked about it and discussed it and it's
sw3275B-ms98-a-0038 133.139875 135.729875 it's come out pretty good now we have a 
sw3275B-ms98-a-0039 135.729875 140.138375 eighteen year old that's fixing to get out of high school and go to college and 
sw3275B-ms98-a-0040 140.138375 142.605875 that's the first thing he wanted
sw3275B-ms98-a-0041 142.605875 144.497625 yeah
sw3275B-ms98-a-0042 144.497625 150.225500 so we kind of discussed that a little bit and shot that idea down right quick
sw3275B-ms98-a-0043 150.225500 152.559875 you know so
sw3275B-ms98-a-0044 152.559875 156.910625 [silence]
sw3275B-ms98-a-0045 156.910625 169.221125 but i think they're too readily accessible and there's too many companies out there that are willing to give them_1 to you and get you dra[ft]- get you trapped i mean you can always file bankruptcy to get out of it but that's a lot of pain and hassle when 
sw3275B-ms98-a-0046 169.221125 172.971375 you know in the olden days when my parents were growing up and uh 
sw3275B-ms98-a-0047 172.971375 181.189125 we couldn't afford everything we didn't have such things as credit cards we just waited till time come around that we could afford it and you know we had all the necessities so 
sw3275B-ms98-a-0048 181.189125 187.419375 and i very seldom use a credit card on necessities i always use it for something i want not something i need
sw3275B-ms98-a-0049 187.419375 188.976750 so
sw3275B-ms98-a-0050 188.976750 193.583000 [silence]
sw3275B-ms98-a-0051 193.583000 194.670000 yeah
sw3275B-ms98-a-0052 194.670000 196.029125 [silence]
sw3275B-ms98-a-0053 196.029125 209.000000 i think if credit cards were as as stringent as say a a home mortgage loan or something like that where you have to you know be able to prove that you can afford this and the rest of your bills we probably wouldn't have the problems we have 
sw3275B-ms98-a-0054 209.000000 215.256250 course we wouldn't have the retail market we have either so i guess they'd trade one for the other 
sw3275B-ms98-a-0055 215.256250 218.851375 i disagree with it but they still trade one for the other
sw3275B-ms98-a-0056 218.851375 220.540125 [silence]
sw3275B-ms98-a-0057 220.540125 227.641250 well that's good i'm it sounds like you kind of got your head together in the credit department for you sound pretty young so
sw3275B-ms98-a-0058 227.641250 229.034250 [silence]
