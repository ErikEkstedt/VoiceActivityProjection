sw3264B-ms98-a-0045 107.560500 112.182500 basically all that's left is to stick the music in front of them_1 and let them play 
sw3264B-ms98-a-0046 112.182500 113.536000 yeah
sw3264B-ms98-a-0047 113.536000 115.479375 [silence]

sw3264B-ms98-a-0054 126.153625 133.723250 she does the Mo[zart]- Mozart and Chopin and Beethoven stuff she sits down and plays all that the hard stuff that i never got around to 
sw3264B-ms98-a-0055 133.723250 137.050375 [silence]
sw3264B-ms98-a-0056 137.050375 137.941500 yeah

sw3264B-ms98-a-0058 141.206500 144.652250 yeah now i now i play guitar 
sw3264B-ms98-a-0059 144.652250 145.767500 yes
sw3264B-ms98-a-0060 145.767500 148.224500 electric uh rhythm
sw3264B-ms98-a-0061 148.224500 153.626875 [silence]
sw3264B-ms98-a-0062 153.626875 160.396500 i i've never had formal lessons i just would sit down and listen to the music and figure it out how to play it [noise] 
sw3264B-ms98-a-0063 160.396500 161.428375 [silence]
sw3264B-ms98-a-0064 161.428375 162.337875 yeah

sw3264B-ms98-a-0067 165.870000 170.604000 [silence]
sw3264B-ms98-a-0068 170.604000 178.651750 yeah uh the the only other problem i have with it is that i've never learned how to learn the the notes for guitar 
sw3264B-ms98-a-0069 178.651750 182.011375 in other words where the fingers would go for the different notes and everything
sw3264B-ms98-a-0070 182.011375 189.008000 and so when if i ever have a conversation with somebody else that plays guitar they start naming off notes and i go whoa you lost me stop 
sw3264B-ms98-a-0071 189.008000 196.976625 [laughter] i and so i can't read tabulates or anything else like that that go along with it so i just have to listen to the music and 
sw3264B-ms98-a-0072 196.976625 198.839375 you know pick it out
sw3264B-ms98-a-0073 198.839375 200.620000 [silence]

sw3264B-ms98-a-0079 209.675000 214.780125 make[s]- makes it easier whenever somebody is trying to teach you a song you just go show me where it goes and i'll do it 
sw3264B-ms98-a-0080 214.780125 218.440250 rather than them going play an A play an E play a B
