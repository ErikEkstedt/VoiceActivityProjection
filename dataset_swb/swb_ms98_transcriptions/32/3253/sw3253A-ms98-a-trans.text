sw3253A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 4.766500 [noise] hi i'm wondering what what camping means to you
sw3253A-ms98-a-0002 4.766500 13.172875 [silence]
sw3253A-ms98-a-0003 13.172875 21.778250 oh very good that's sort of the same thing that that i do i don't think of um trailers and campers and all this stuff
sw3253A-ms98-a-0004 21.778250 24.166125 um do you do much camping
sw3253A-ms98-a-0005 24.166125 25.302750 [silence]
sw3253A-ms98-a-0006 25.302750 29.079500 oh you've never been camping oh gee
sw3253A-ms98-a-0007 29.079500 37.335250 well um yes and no and the uh i haven't done much recently but um up until
sw3253A-ms98-a-0008 37.335250 45.637625 gee maybe five or six years ago i did a lot of it [noise] and you know i've sorry
sw3253A-ms98-a-0009 45.637625 46.835750 [silence]
sw3253A-ms98-a-0010 46.835750 59.206500 no um i used to live abroad and so i- i camped a lot in um the Middle East and i was able to camp right in ruins which was always very exciting
sw3253A-ms98-a-0011 59.206500 68.462625 [laughter] and a bit exotic [laughter] for those who love bugs but [laughter]
sw3253A-ms98-a-0012 68.462625 78.492375 um and then when i used to come back to the states in summer we'd often go up um to the lake country in New York with my brother's family and and do camping there
sw3253A-ms98-a-0013 78.492375 87.578125 [silence]
sw3253A-ms98-a-0014 87.578125 90.414125 [noise]
sw3253A-ms98-a-0015 90.414125 100.056625 [silence]
sw3253A-ms98-a-0016 100.056625 102.009875 and you're not going
sw3253A-ms98-a-0017 102.009875 104.045375 [silence]
sw3253A-ms98-a-0018 104.045375 106.704000 oh that's too bad
sw3253A-ms98-a-0019 106.704000 108.541250 [silence]
sw3253A-ms98-a-0020 108.541250 110.636000 oh gee
sw3253A-ms98-a-0021 110.636000 115.998750 i guess it makes a difference i grew up camping being in Girl Scouts and things like that so
sw3253A-ms98-a-0022 115.998750 117.889250 [silence]
sw3253A-ms98-a-0023 117.889250 120.929750 uh-huh uh-huh [laughter]
sw3253A-ms98-a-0024 120.929750 128.608875 [silence]
sw3253A-ms98-a-0025 128.608875 141.493750 oh that's too bad i think the you know there's certainly a lot of aspects you would like but maybe not the you you know the Canada men's trip but some other you know a nice tent on the the shore of a lake and
sw3253A-ms98-a-0026 141.493750 145.417750 [silence]
sw3253A-ms98-a-0027 145.417750 155.528125 right the and the the no telephone the gee whiz you go to bed when it gets dark and you get up when it gets [laughter-light] 
sw3253A-ms98-a-0028 155.528125 162.493375 yeah and um i guess just just the change from the rat race
sw3253A-ms98-a-0029 162.493375 169.319250 [silence]
sw3253A-ms98-a-0030 169.319250 181.133250 no it's uh it's pretty isolated um and to me i like that i guess too although there are people i mean you know it's really hard to get away
sw3253A-ms98-a-0031 181.133250 189.594125 [noise] and i guess when when we did sites in in the Middle East of course it was with a group in order to make it safe
sw3253A-ms98-a-0032 189.594125 198.994500 but i mean we'd go in different parts of the ruins and and things like that but we didn't even have tents there [laughter] we just sort of put out the sleeping [laughter-roll]
sw3253A-ms98-a-0033 198.994500 201.798375 [laughter]
sw3253A-ms98-a-0034 201.798375 204.625125 [silence]
sw3253A-ms98-a-0035 204.625125 207.351500 [laughter]
sw3253A-ms98-a-0036 207.351500 218.794625 [silence]
sw3253A-ms98-a-0037 218.794625 220.191750 right
sw3253A-ms98-a-0038 220.191750 221.738750 [silence]
sw3253A-ms98-a-0039 221.738750 234.668125 [laughter] right actually i just joined um the Appalachian Trail Walking Club or whatever they call it what uh and i'm very eager to to start uh i love to walk
sw3253A-ms98-a-0040 234.668125 249.248500 and um i'm going to start with day trips though because i don't know the territory and all and i'm not sure um my son is not eager to go and [laughter] you know i think that that that might be a little eerie at first going alone 
sw3253A-ms98-a-0041 249.248500 252.921500 [laughter]
sw3253A-ms98-a-0042 252.921500 263.123750 oh but you know i'm gonna try [laughter] well gee whiz i hope you get into camping some day just slowly

sw3253A-ms98-a-0045 267.468375 277.075500 [silence]
sw3253A-ms98-a-0046 277.075500 284.386750 right i think that you know [noise] i guess one time recently we went up to Maine and had planned to camp
sw3253A-ms98-a-0047 284.386750 298.530000 and you know the only site left when we got there was in the middle of a field and i said gee whiz for twenty dollars we can go down the road and get a a motel which we did and so that you know if the setting was right and that it's it's great but if it's j[ust]-
