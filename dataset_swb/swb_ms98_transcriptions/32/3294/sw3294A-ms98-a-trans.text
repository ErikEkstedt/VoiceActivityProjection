sw3294A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.010875 [noise]
sw3294A-ms98-a-0002 1.010875 3.061375 so so what gets you
sw3294A-ms98-a-0003 3.061375 15.034250 [silence]
sw3294A-ms98-a-0004 15.034250 16.316500 um-hum
sw3294A-ms98-a-0005 16.316500 19.356000 [silence]
sw3294A-ms98-a-0006 19.356000 20.567375 um-hum
sw3294A-ms98-a-0007 20.567375 34.332625 [silence]
sw3294A-ms98-a-0008 34.332625 42.073750 well i mean i [vocalized-noise] that's exactly the kind of thing i would have said although in my case it's my wife and i both work we come home
sw3294A-ms98-a-0009 42.073750 48.335750 and just as we're preparing dinner or eating dinner the phone rings and it's one solicitation call after another and
sw3294A-ms98-a-0010 48.335750 49.591000 you know
sw3294A-ms98-a-0011 49.591000 50.631875 [silence]
sw3294A-ms98-a-0012 50.631875 56.309125 yeah it's it's [vocalized-noise] like you say very annoying and um why why do we let this happen
sw3294A-ms98-a-0013 56.309125 66.669250 [silence]
sw3294A-ms98-a-0014 66.669250 71.437250 would would you [vocalized-noise] mean if you could legislate something what would you legislate
sw3294A-ms98-a-0015 71.437250 90.378875 [silence]
sw3294A-ms98-a-0016 90.378875 98.056125 yeah it it seems it seems to me that we should have the ability to designate with the phone company that we don't wanna receive calls like that
sw3294A-ms98-a-0017 98.056125 102.499125 and the people making these calls would be obliged to c[ompare]- compare
sw3294A-ms98-a-0018 102.499125 108.097250 the their lists that they're gonna call against this list of people who don't wanna be called
sw3294A-ms98-a-0019 108.097250 109.697875 um
sw3294A-ms98-a-0020 109.697875 115.550000 and that that way those who want it can have it and those who don't want it don't have to have it
sw3294A-ms98-a-0021 115.550000 124.511875 sort of like an unlisted number where you haven't gone to the trouble of enlisting yourself except even unlisted numbers aren't safe now because they have these things just sort of dial through all the numbers
sw3294A-ms98-a-0022 124.511875 126.870000 um automatically and
sw3294A-ms98-a-0023 126.870000 127.978375 [silence]

sw3294A-ms98-a-0034 158.899000 160.224875 yes
sw3294A-ms98-a-0035 160.224875 161.594250 [silence]
sw3294A-ms98-a-0036 161.594250 167.010500 and these and these people may in fact be just looking to s[teal]- find an unoccupied house to rob
sw3294A-ms98-a-0037 167.010500 172.973000 [silence]
sw3294A-ms98-a-0038 172.973000 174.039625 um-hum

sw3294A-ms98-a-0040 178.200750 179.571750 yeah
sw3294A-ms98-a-0041 179.571750 187.823875 what about these telephone callers sometimes [vocalized-noise] they're door-to-door but usually they're telephone callers who who want you to basically help them fill out a questionnaire 
sw3294A-ms98-a-0042 187.823875 189.637250 [silence]
sw3294A-ms98-a-0043 189.637250 190.493000 [noise]
sw3294A-ms98-a-0044 190.493000 191.822750 [silence]
sw3294A-ms98-a-0045 191.822750 195.953875 well i think these people are hired by from from different sources
sw3294A-ms98-a-0046 195.953875 201.469750 um [vocalized-noise] with you know and so therefore there's no one answer but but [vocalized-noise]
sw3294A-ms98-a-0047 201.469750 211.756125 yeah sometimes it's a market sur[vey]- basically it's a market survey but they never say who who they're really working for or what [noise] you know what what what questions are you know
sw3294A-ms98-a-0048 211.756125 219.831625 [silence]
sw3294A-ms98-a-0049 219.831625 221.074000 yeah

sw3294A-ms98-a-0051 224.511000 225.656750 yeah
sw3294A-ms98-a-0052 225.656750 227.621875 [silence]
sw3294A-ms98-a-0053 227.621875 228.663875 yeah
sw3294A-ms98-a-0054 228.663875 229.965375 [silence]
sw3294A-ms98-a-0055 229.965375 230.802000 yeah
sw3294A-ms98-a-0056 230.802000 231.859750 [silence]
sw3294A-ms98-a-0057 231.859750 236.564750 right well [vocalized-noise] and sometimes that's this is just the lead in to a sales pitch too
sw3294A-ms98-a-0058 236.564750 240.766000 other times it's you know wasting your time to collect the data they want for [laughter-their]
sw3294A-ms98-a-0059 240.766000 249.995375 marketing purpose for which if they would just pay me enough money i would be willing to consider but but a dollar isn't it you know it's [laughter] uh
sw3294A-ms98-a-0060 249.995375 254.914750 and i also sort of worry that you know that sometimes people give away personal information um
sw3294A-ms98-a-0061 254.914750 267.242250 [vocalized-noise] when when the call comes and and they uh uh you know [vocalized-noise] sort of seductive to you know somebody's asking me my -[o]pinion on all of these things and so i start answering and then you you know you go down a path um
sw3294A-ms98-a-0062 267.242250 269.942750 and you don't know where it's gonna end uh
sw3294A-ms98-a-0063 269.942750 274.580500 in fact you don't even know what you've eventually you know the totality of what you've revealed and you know
sw3294A-ms98-a-0064 274.580500 280.784375 this isn't you know prob[ably]- most likely not to going to be used against you but it could and
sw3294A-ms98-a-0065 280.784375 284.750750 and that seems to be something that should should really be outlawed
sw3294A-ms98-a-0066 284.750750 287.335250 because it's subject to abuse and it
sw3294A-ms98-a-0067 287.335250 298.722000 [silence]
