sw3226A-ms98-a-0002 0.768500 14.571250 okay the topic of the conversation is national health insurance and the pros and cons and do i do we think that the government should finance it what is your opinion
sw3226A-ms98-a-0003 14.571250 16.305875 you say yes
sw3226A-ms98-a-0004 16.305875 29.081625 [silence]
sw3226A-ms98-a-0005 29.081625 35.157875 i have heard someone else uh say that uh the Canadian health insurance is absolutely excellent
sw3226A-ms98-a-0006 35.157875 41.573500 and one of the ways that they're financing it is they have an exorbitant tax on their cigarettes
sw3226A-ms98-a-0007 41.573500 44.056750 [laughter] this is [laughter]
sw3226A-ms98-a-0008 44.056750 56.706500 e[vidently]- evidently this is one of the ways that they're paying for the program plus discouraging the people to quit smoking so they don't have to pay out as many uh benefits on like lung cancer and things like this
sw3226A-ms98-a-0009 56.706500 71.623375 [silence]
sw3226A-ms98-a-0010 71.623375 73.575375 yeah if

sw3226A-ms98-a-0016 91.406000 100.222625 well we're fortunate in that we so far knock on wood most of us have been relati[vely]- real healthy so we don't have a lot of medical bills
sw3226A-ms98-a-0017 100.222625 104.490625 [silence]
sw3226A-ms98-a-0018 104.490625 107.537500 yeah but what worries me is the fact that
sw3226A-ms98-a-0019 107.537500 112.643875 i don't like the government telling me who i can see and who i can't see
sw3226A-ms98-a-0020 112.643875 115.823625 [silence]
sw3226A-ms98-a-0021 115.823625 117.171000 um-hum

sw3226A-ms98-a-0026 125.815500 129.997000 yeah yeah i know that when James was with Continental Steel
sw3226A-ms98-a-0027 129.997000 135.783000 McCullum was part of that and and that's good but i also heard for instance like uh
sw3226A-ms98-a-0028 135.783000 141.496625 a friend's daughter was on it through Texas Instruments and she was on that Kaiser Permanent
sw3226A-ms98-a-0029 141.496625 149.118500 and they had screwed up her appointment and when she went in she had to take whichever doctor was available
sw3226A-ms98-a-0030 149.118500 156.030500 and they she would have had to wait like two months to get the doctor she wanted
sw3226A-ms98-a-0031 156.030500 157.213000 [silence]
sw3226A-ms98-a-0032 157.213000 161.528625 but then again i guess you can even do that in McCullum's [laughter]
sw3226A-ms98-a-0033 161.528625 163.447375 [silence]

sw3226A-ms98-a-0048 204.510125 214.897875 [silence]
sw3226A-ms98-a-0049 214.897875 221.422125 i know that it's getting to the point that the insurance doesn't pay that much on catastrophic illnesses
sw3226A-ms98-a-0050 221.422125 227.105625 they don't pay anything on uh implants or transplants
