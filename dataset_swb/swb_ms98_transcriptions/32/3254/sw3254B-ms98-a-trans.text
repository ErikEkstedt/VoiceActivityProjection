sw3254B-ms98-a-0003 1.801875 6.449250 oh i generally go to the quickie places just because they're cheap
sw3254B-ms98-a-0004 6.449250 7.509375 [silence]
sw3254B-ms98-a-0005 7.509375 17.225125 uh we have four but most of them_1 are gone now so there there might be but we were taking you know uh four five and six people out [laughter]
sw3254B-ms98-a-0006 17.225125 19.550750 [laughter] yes
sw3254B-ms98-a-0007 19.550750 21.828500 [silence]
sw3254B-ms98-a-0008 21.828500 23.891000 i'm in Texas
sw3254B-ms98-a-0009 23.891000 25.006750 [silence]
sw3254B-ms98-a-0010 25.006750 29.599250 and we live[d]- we lived in Ohio prior to this [laughter-oh]
sw3254B-ms98-a-0011 29.599250 33.142750 [noise] uh we were up near Cleveland yeah
sw3254B-ms98-a-0012 33.142750 43.007000 [noise] but i look for service even at the quickie places type things uh i don't like to go to the drive-thrus because sometimes they get your order wrong and then you're stuck and it's a pain to have to
sw3254B-ms98-a-0013 43.007000 49.781625 stand there and see what it is before you leave so i really don't like the drive-thrus that much i- i like to go and eat there
sw3254B-ms98-a-0014 49.781625 60.712000 but i would say service uh atmosphere and whether the food is good on on going out i like steaks [noise] so we try to hit those places when we can
sw3254B-ms98-a-0015 60.712000 67.328500 [silence]
sw3254B-ms98-a-0016 67.328500 68.911000 um-hum

sw3254B-ms98-a-0018 71.555875 72.841375 yeah
sw3254B-ms98-a-0019 72.841375 75.779500 [silence]
sw3254B-ms98-a-0020 75.779500 78.126375 [laughter]
sw3254B-ms98-a-0021 78.126375 80.873125 [silence]
sw3254B-ms98-a-0022 80.873125 90.593500 [noise] uh [noise] yeah and in in in the countries unless it's a large city i guess Dairy Queen and Wal-Mart are their main [laughter] that's what you find right
sw3254B-ms98-a-0023 90.593500 102.843875 my husband likes um Dairy Queens he likes their milk shakes and their chili cheese dogs i guess so he's a fan of of Dairy Queen and and we'll go even in town here at times just as a a change although
sw3254B-ms98-a-0024 102.843875 110.206500 [noise] i'm not that excited about it it we've ea[ten]- we eat out so much it's gotten so i don't like to really eat any place but yet i hate to cook food at home
sw3254B-ms98-a-0025 110.206500 119.242500 so that might be why i look for inexpensive [laughter-places] just because we're eating out probably five
sw3254B-ms98-a-0026 119.242500 124.117625 nights a week maybe or we eat junk food at home
sw3254B-ms98-a-0027 124.117625 126.129500 uh now that my husband 
sw3254B-ms98-a-0028 126.129500 128.070375 [silence]
sw3254B-ms98-a-0029 128.070375 136.852000 oh we'll go to them_1 all we sort of take turns and and we uh i'm sort of favor the ones if i have a coupon we can go there and if not we can't
sw3254B-ms98-a-0030 136.852000 142.894375 [noise] because it's cheaper so mine is monetarily i guess strongly monetarily
sw3254B-ms98-a-0031 142.894375 150.057250 based uh we'll go get pizza and uh at Little Caesar's although the kids prefer Domino's
sw3254B-ms98-a-0032 150.057250 151.157625 [silence]
sw3254B-ms98-a-0033 151.157625 152.663000 right
sw3254B-ms98-a-0034 152.663000 158.264125 but it's just a lot cheaper than than Domino's so that's
sw3254B-ms98-a-0035 158.264125 161.728125 we go to Grandy's quite a bit i would say
sw3254B-ms98-a-0036 161.728125 162.775750 [silence]
sw3254B-ms98-a-0037 162.775750 174.623750 [noise] McDonald's uh we've sort of been off of that for a while and no particular reason and i- i maybe we avoided Wendy's the last few years because_1 our daughter worked there and she never wanted [laughter-us] [laughter-show] up there
sw3254B-ms98-a-0038 174.623750 178.676250 [noise] so i don't uh we don't go

sw3254B-ms98-a-0062 278.644750 291.914750 so we were never home at the same time and i'm not one that's going to fix you know the meal at two o'clock in the afternoon so they can eat it all day whenever they're there if they're not there in between five and six well then i guess we don't eat today or you go [laughter-you] [laughter-know] you fend for yourself you go somewhere else
