sw3216A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 3.503500 [noise] okay let's talk about schooling
sw3216A-ms98-a-0002 3.503500 10.440625 [silence]
sw3216A-ms98-a-0003 10.440625 18.928125 okay well i have a boy and he just went into middle school early and i have a girl and she's in uh grade school 
sw3216A-ms98-a-0004 18.928125 28.843875 and then i have a little boy who goes to uh they have something just before kindergarten and it's called Early Childhood and i have a young a young boy in that
sw3216A-ms98-a-0005 28.843875 33.537125 so i- i have a lot of children in in the school system down here
sw3216A-ms98-a-0006 33.537125 42.574625 and um i think we have excellent teachers here i am really uh like the stu[dents]- like the way the teachers work with the students
sw3216A-ms98-a-0007 42.574625 46.567375 uh i've not been so um
sw3216A-ms98-a-0008 46.567375 60.081625 happy with the schools [laughter] themselves i guess like my last year my son and daughter were in the same grade school before he moved up to middle school and it was just packed
sw3216A-ms98-a-0009 60.081625 65.815750 i mean it was a a fire hazard if we had any kind of assembly there with parents
sw3216A-ms98-a-0010 65.815750 72.932375 and it was just a real problem uh so we had to do a bond issue and and um
sw3216A-ms98-a-0011 72.932375 79.406750 [noise] vote to take money and either have students bussed to different schools if that's what they preferred to do
sw3216A-ms98-a-0012 79.406750 84.382625 or to uh work on the sch[ool]- work for another school to be built
sw3216A-ms98-a-0013 84.382625 91.204750 which is a good idea but in the meantime the school still has lots and lots of kids in it [noise]
sw3216A-ms98-a-0014 91.204750 99.542875 so um i think one thing is that would maybe we don't have enough schools and secondly when we have enough schools
sw3216A-ms98-a-0015 99.542875 106.808875 sometimes we can't get the the support for the teachers that we need to pay them to keep good teachers
sw3216A-ms98-a-0016 106.808875 117.348625 [silence]
sw3216A-ms98-a-0017 117.348625 118.742500 oh

sw3216A-ms98-a-0033 211.228375 219.684000 it is so hard with a family system um either divorced or or just one parent or just
sw3216A-ms98-a-0034 219.684000 225.559375 uh li[ke]- and then if both of them_1 have to work even that is a a hard situation
sw3216A-ms98-a-0035 225.559375 233.117750 for the children uh to to have a supportive system around them to make school work for them
sw3216A-ms98-a-0036 233.117750 238.486375 and i think it's really important that the parents work with the school um
sw3216A-ms98-a-0037 238.486375 249.056250 i think what you said is is really a pinpoint though that the student and the family life really adds or detracts from what's happening in the school
sw3216A-ms98-a-0038 249.056250 257.494500 so um well what about your wife is she she happy at school or [laughter] she's just ready
