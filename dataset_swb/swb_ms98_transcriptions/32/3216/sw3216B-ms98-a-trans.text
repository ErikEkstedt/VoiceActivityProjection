sw3216B-ms98-a-0017 105.797500 118.870625 well i think that's i think that's uh true i i've got a a little different uh contact but i've i've got a one son that graduated from high school last year and another son that's a
sw3216B-ms98-a-0018 118.870625 127.338875 a sophomore this year and uh my wife teaches kindergarten here in Richardson [noise] ah but
sw3216B-ms98-a-0019 127.338875 128.432375 [silence]
sw3216B-ms98-a-0020 128.432375 134.903750 in general i i think that the you know one of the reasons that we we uh
sw3216B-ms98-a-0021 134.903750 142.853625 the choice to live in Richardson when we when we came here was the was the schools and i think that Plano and Richardson in terms of the uh
sw3216B-ms98-a-0022 142.853625 149.082125 uh things seriously wrong with the public schools are are not nearly to the extent that that
sw3216B-ms98-a-0023 149.082125 161.192750 [vocalized-noise] and right right and i think and i think part of that is that is the the uh your big part of that is just uh the demographics the population in those schools are are
sw3216B-ms98-a-0024 161.192750 170.053000 typically uh people that very much value the education and support the the school systems and and uh
sw3216B-ms98-a-0025 170.053000 174.523000 although there is still some still some problems but uh
sw3216B-ms98-a-0026 174.523000 186.769000 i i- you know i wh[en]- when i was when i was going to school and i grew up in Iowa and and w[e]- in my family school was certainly valued but if there was ever any sort of a uh
sw3216B-ms98-a-0027 186.769000 198.016250 [vocalized-noise] if e[ver]- if i was ever in trouble in school i was also in trouble at home [laughter-and] an[d]- even more so and i think that that part of it is is not
sw3216B-ms98-a-0028 198.016250 202.061750 exactly with the schools but with the with the uh
sw3216B-ms98-a-0029 202.061750 208.953750 the culture that doesn't doesn't value the education and doesn't value the schools and doesn't support uh
