sw3215B-ms98-a-0010 34.777000 48.573125 i just got back from Dayton i spent the weekend in Ohio with my family and the trees are changing color there so that as soon as we got out of the cloud cover of course it wasn't sunny like it is here it was real gray
sw3215B-ms98-a-0011 48.573125 54.663500 [noise] but as soon as the plane got through the clouds and i saw all those trees it just really made me
sw3215B-ms98-a-0012 54.663500 68.192750 [noise] realize how much i miss the fall [noise] i don't complain {weatherwise} though because it was also thirty five degrees there yesterday morning and the high was only fifty and it was supposed to drop and get sleet in the afternoon
sw3215B-ms98-a-0013 68.192750 72.605750 [noise] so it was nice to get off the plane where it was in the seventies

sw3215B-ms98-a-0019 88.724750 100.841250 we did that when we lived up in Michigan we went up to the upper peninsula and they actually printed out maps of routes you could take so you would get maximum leaf exposure [noise]
sw3215B-ms98-a-0020 100.841250 113.550875 [noise] and then on leaf weekends it wa[s]- which is this time of the year it's bumper to bumper traffic people it's whoever was driving could never have a prayer of looking at the leaves because they had to keep watching the road
sw3215B-ms98-a-0021 113.550875 114.906625 [silence]

sw3215B-ms98-a-0030 169.146500 175.565000 so as i understand it here if there's anything they'll call off schools and and close businesses
