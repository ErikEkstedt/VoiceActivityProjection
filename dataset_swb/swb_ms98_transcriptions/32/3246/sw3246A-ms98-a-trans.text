sw3246A-ms98-a-0002 2.977875 19.276125 [silence]

sw3246A-ms98-a-0004 21.113000 23.222750 [silence]
sw3246A-ms98-a-0005 23.222750 26.402500 yes and i taught for fourteen years
sw3246A-ms98-a-0006 26.402500 30.792250 before we moved to Texas and the the one thing i see is changing is
sw3246A-ms98-a-0007 30.792250 45.092125 i was held accountable so much i had to document and create a paper chase for all of my students and instead of spending my time coming up with creative learning stations and things like that i was filling out all these forms for all the children
sw3246A-ms98-a-0008 45.092125 52.288875 everything had to be documented and i had file cabinets that weren't filled with neat stuff for kids it was filled with documentation
sw3246A-ms98-a-0009 52.288875 54.134000 yes
sw3246A-ms98-a-0010 54.134000 64.524750 [silence]

sw3246A-ms98-a-0012 66.613500 77.221250 [silence]
sw3246A-ms98-a-0013 77.221250 79.601125 i think so too
sw3246A-ms98-a-0014 79.601125 85.522875 they're so worried about lawsuits and the scores that children get on tests now
sw3246A-ms98-a-0015 85.522875 95.034125 and teacher competency you know and it's not like the teacher can just get in there and do her best she's always worried whose looking over her shoulder and
sw3246A-ms98-a-0016 95.034125 97.683500 that's right
sw3246A-ms98-a-0017 97.683500 99.791750 i know
sw3246A-ms98-a-0018 99.791750 108.380625 [silence]
sw3246A-ms98-a-0019 108.380625 110.147500 that's right
sw3246A-ms98-a-0020 110.147500 111.359125 [silence]

sw3246A-ms98-a-0023 121.024625 122.840125 ah
sw3246A-ms98-a-0024 122.840125 127.391500 [silence]
sw3246A-ms98-a-0025 127.391500 139.600750 yep are you in Plano yep i am too and i have one in ninth grade at Clark and one at Hendrick this year and he my nin[th]- my uh sixth grader came from an open classroom at Matthews
sw3246A-ms98-a-0026 139.600750 153.656250 and the very first year i taught back in seventy three we had open classroom and it didn't work then and when we moved down here i was just appalled that they were still doing it here [noise]
sw3246A-ms98-a-0027 153.656250 165.793750 [silence]
sw3246A-ms98-a-0028 165.793750 171.393500 partitions or just to face the children different directions or to do something
sw3246A-ms98-a-0029 171.393500 182.003625 i know last year my son had to eat in the classroom because there was no cafeteria at his school so he spent all day in this one large open area
sw3246A-ms98-a-0030 182.003625 188.804000 so i didn't really care for that it seems like the schools in Michigan were much better than they are down here
sw3246A-ms98-a-0031 188.804000 192.141250 that was our last tour up in Michigan
sw3246A-ms98-a-0032 192.141250 198.942000 [silence]

sw3246A-ms98-a-0041 234.460750 240.431875 [silence]
sw3246A-ms98-a-0042 240.431875 247.217625 probably so on publicity and letting realtors know and key people how wonderful the schools are
sw3246A-ms98-a-0043 247.217625 248.765875 so
sw3246A-ms98-a-0044 248.765875 250.046875 [silence]
sw3246A-ms98-a-0045 250.046875 252.948875 as a freshman yep

sw3246A-ms98-a-0053 272.762625 277.731500 and she seems to be studying and has just about the right amount of homework i would expect
sw3246A-ms98-a-0054 277.731500 282.216375 for a freshman to have she's not bogged down but yet she has some every night
sw3246A-ms98-a-0055 282.216375 289.451375 [silence]
sw3246A-ms98-a-0056 289.451375 298.626000 yes you always hear how good now my son's at junior high and says that his grades are going to be wonderful but who knows what he's going to bring home so i don't
