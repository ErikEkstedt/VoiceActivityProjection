sw3276A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 3.863375 [noise] okay as far as uh universal health care um
sw3276A-ms98-a-0002 3.863375 8.370625 i guess i'm all for it i think it's time that we start looking at um
sw3276A-ms98-a-0003 8.370625 20.134250 getting into that um health cost has continued to rise and i think uh there's people that to me it's the fundamental uh l[ife]- life of a person um
sw3276A-ms98-a-0004 20.134250 25.472375 i[t]- it doesn't matter if you have money or no mo[ney]- or all the money in the world um you would
sw3276A-ms98-a-0005 25.472375 40.123500 everybody should be able to have surgeries that will save their lives or things that will make their life more comfortable verses than just the rich people that can afford to pay or to work for corporations that have wonderful health benefits
sw3276A-ms98-a-0006 40.123500 49.137000 um i think if uh they looked at it as a way of business helping out financially for universal health care and
sw3276A-ms98-a-0007 49.137000 61.589250 uh individuals um helping out in some sort of way whether it be taxes or some how but uh the expenses right now for health care um are just unreal
sw3276A-ms98-a-0008 61.589250 65.841875 [silence]
sw3276A-ms98-a-0009 65.841875 67.495125 yes
sw3276A-ms98-a-0010 67.495125 69.006875 um-hum
sw3276A-ms98-a-0011 69.006875 70.411750 oh sure
sw3276A-ms98-a-0012 70.411750 72.334375 [silence]
sw3276A-ms98-a-0013 72.334375 75.854625 and your constantly exactly
sw3276A-ms98-a-0014 75.854625 84.655625 yeah the only i- i know that um uh i know a little bit about the uh European uh universal health care and there's some
sw3276A-ms98-a-0015 84.655625 91.012125 pros and cons one of the things of course is everybody gets health care but uh sometimes health care
sw3276A-ms98-a-0016 91.012125 97.067500 uh when you get into a universal system lacks in uh what would be considered uh
sw3276A-ms98-a-0017 97.067500 105.394000 how can i say it um over like in Poland uh where my father-in-law lived for years their their health care system is
sw3276A-ms98-a-0018 105.394000 109.793500 um because no financial gains are available for doctors
sw3276A-ms98-a-0019 109.793500 122.631750 uh they may just go into being a doctor just clearly just to be a doctor for the full reason but most people that go in to being a physician here in the US do it for financial gain
sw3276A-ms98-a-0020 122.631750 130.144750 they say well jeez if i get into this area of dermatology i don't have to do this i can do this and i can you know
sw3276A-ms98-a-0021 130.144750 139.487500 yeah or plastic surgery or uh if i become a uh heart specialist i'm gonna make this kind of money uh and there's
sw3276A-ms98-a-0022 139.487500 146.944500 you know financial gains toward that and in a universal system i don't think there is a financial gain for the doctors
sw3276A-ms98-a-0023 146.944500 149.014500 [silence]
sw3276A-ms98-a-0024 149.014500 154.921750 the quality i think goes down um-hum when you have a universal system um
sw3276A-ms98-a-0025 154.921750 165.008625 the only way they could do that is by having a real good quality check um and also offering some kind of because i think uh all physicians well anybody um
sw3276A-ms98-a-0026 165.008625 175.486625 likes the a[bility]- ability to kind of uh get themselves financially uh situated uh i guess that's the whole US concept is to come here and
sw3276A-ms98-a-0027 175.486625 182.770375 yeah and i don't know if you can have that with a universal system maybe you know there's a way of working that out but
sw3276A-ms98-a-0028 182.770375 190.868500 i know that in Poland in particular the doctors just go to do their job and that's it that's what they look at it as there's no
sw3276A-ms98-a-0029 190.868500 200.443125 uh and that's sad because if that's the case i[f]- if doctors aren't going in to be doctors to help people then maybe they shouldn't be in that area anyway but
sw3276A-ms98-a-0030 200.443125 207.502625 that might be one way of weeding out those that are greedy for the money and those that really want to help mankind
sw3276A-ms98-a-0031 207.502625 209.258250 so
sw3276A-ms98-a-0032 209.258250 212.621375 but i- i think we have to head toward that way
sw3276A-ms98-a-0033 212.621375 216.065375 [silence]
sw3276A-ms98-a-0034 216.065375 217.782250 uh-huh
sw3276A-ms98-a-0035 217.782250 223.784000 i'm worried when i get older [laughter] you know and uh let's say for instance you uh
sw3276A-ms98-a-0036 223.784000 228.802250 get fired or or not fired but maybe laid off from your job you no longer have insurance
sw3276A-ms98-a-0037 228.802250 234.473375 i mean and you're sixty some or uh fifty some years old you try try to find insurance
sw3276A-ms98-a-0038 234.473375 244.907125 i mean y[ou're]- you're uninsurable unless you want to pay five hundred six hundred dollars a month and i know people that are paying two hundred three hundred dollars a month for insurance
sw3276A-ms98-a-0039 244.907125 255.153625 and how they can do it i have no idea um i know working for small corporations and health insurance um myself
sw3276A-ms98-a-0040 255.153625 267.908500 um it would cost for a family and this was back three four years ago to put my entire family up and this was working for like a {medcenter} uh health plan 
sw3276A-ms98-a-0041 267.908500 272.502000 um it was like eighty dollars out of my paycheck so
sw3276A-ms98-a-0042 272.502000 277.905625 [silence]
sw3276A-ms98-a-0043 277.905625 279.563750 see yeah
sw3276A-ms98-a-0044 279.563750 281.434750 [silence]
sw3276A-ms98-a-0045 281.434750 289.036125 well we do the same i mean it's i think uh people are changing their viewpoints of you know it's getting harder and harder to survive
sw3276A-ms98-a-0046 289.036125 296.637500 and uh and that's why uh if they don't go to a universal system something's going to happen we're gonna have uh
sw3276A-ms98-a-0047 296.637500 299.522000 uh larger amount of people dying
