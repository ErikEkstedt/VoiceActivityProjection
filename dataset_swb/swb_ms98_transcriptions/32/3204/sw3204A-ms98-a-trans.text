sw3204A-ms98-a-0002 0.537500 2.119125 [silence]
sw3204A-ms98-a-0003 2.119125 11.009875 um well about nursing homes and and older people uh my husband has a grandmother that lives with his mother
sw3204A-ms98-a-0004 11.009875 24.130500 and they're just really close here and his mother has bad health too and so i go over sometimes in the day when he's at work and i um help with her and bathe her and feed her
sw3204A-ms98-a-0005 24.130500 35.018000 and um and i- i it's hard to be a caretaker i really believe it's really difficult to be a caretaker twenty four hours a day
sw3204A-ms98-a-0006 35.018000 41.009625 uh it she has Alzheimer's and does not remember
sw3204A-ms98-a-0007 41.009625 48.911625 uh a lot if anything and so she asks the same questions over and over again
sw3204A-ms98-a-0008 48.911625 58.159500 which is not un[realistic]- you know unrealistic um and so you just have to try and be patient and answer them_1 again or just answer another question
sw3204A-ms98-a-0009 58.159500 70.969625 uh i- i some nights his mother calls me and says can your family and just bring the kids in the family and just come over and and visit grandma because she gets very disoriented
sw3204A-ms98-a-0010 70.969625 73.046750 she's ninety two
sw3204A-ms98-a-0011 73.046750 77.073375 [silence]
sw3204A-ms98-a-0012 77.073375 80.436500 oh well i think that's wonderful
sw3204A-ms98-a-0013 80.436500 84.915750 [silence]
sw3204A-ms98-a-0014 84.915750 86.128375 well
sw3204A-ms98-a-0015 86.128375 87.853000 um-hum
sw3204A-ms98-a-0016 87.853000 90.009125 [silence]
sw3204A-ms98-a-0017 90.009125 93.002250 yeah i was just gonna say
sw3204A-ms98-a-0018 93.002250 100.506875 [silence]
sw3204A-ms98-a-0019 100.506875 103.506500 yeah um
sw3204A-ms98-a-0020 103.506500 109.653250 [silence]
sw3204A-ms98-a-0021 109.653250 121.307375 yes uh i think it's wonderful these these places that aren't nursing homes necessarily but they can and reside there like little apartment places in between places
sw3204A-ms98-a-0022 121.307375 127.017375 and i like that idea if they can handle it themselves um
sw3204A-ms98-a-0023 127.017375 133.666000 [silence]
sw3204A-ms98-a-0024 133.666000 135.731875 yeah yeah [laughter]

sw3204A-ms98-a-0030 152.137750 160.588000 [silence]
sw3204A-ms98-a-0031 160.588000 162.496000 nursing homes
sw3204A-ms98-a-0032 162.496000 166.157500 [silence]
sw3204A-ms98-a-0033 166.157500 167.946375 visit [vocalized-noise]

sw3204A-ms98-a-0036 171.487750 174.304375 [silence]
sw3204A-ms98-a-0037 174.304375 178.074500 they don't go and see them that's right that's right
sw3204A-ms98-a-0038 178.074500 184.393125 [silence]
sw3204A-ms98-a-0039 184.393125 190.507125 you know um i- i think nursing homes are
sw3204A-ms98-a-0040 190.507125 202.624500 our um some are good i have to say that but for the most part i truly believe that the parents would be better if they were with the children
sw3204A-ms98-a-0041 202.624500 204.892500 um
sw3204A-ms98-a-0042 204.892500 207.497125 [silence]
sw3204A-ms98-a-0043 207.497125 209.998875 right right
sw3204A-ms98-a-0044 209.998875 218.064500 [silence]
sw3204A-ms98-a-0045 218.064500 225.607750 um-hum i hope so you know it's i think it's very difficult in the first place to make that choice
sw3204A-ms98-a-0046 225.607750 237.820750 to have them go there and then if you find out that they are not having good care you know i'm sure that it is just you know you'd pull them_1 out of there so fast
sw3204A-ms98-a-0047 237.820750 246.467375 and uh and yet if you didn't feel like you could be a good caretaker i don't [vocalized-noise] it's a very very hard decision i think
sw3204A-ms98-a-0048 246.467375 249.339875 [silence]
sw3204A-ms98-a-0049 249.339875 251.078875 um-hum
sw3204A-ms98-a-0050 251.078875 260.675125 i think that's right and especially if you're not a person that is like a medical person maybe or something that the person needs medical treatment
sw3204A-ms98-a-0051 260.675125 265.857125 now i know a friend of mine who had a father um she brought to her home
sw3204A-ms98-a-0052 265.857125 274.610000 um to live there but he needed the medical treatment and she had a nursing person come in like three times a week to to help him out
sw3204A-ms98-a-0053 274.610000 279.847750 and that might be a partial solution or something but um
sw3204A-ms98-a-0054 279.847750 286.663875 i personally am for the trying it at home caretaker part before i think i'd ever
sw3204A-ms98-a-0055 286.663875 287.994875 yeah
sw3204A-ms98-a-0056 287.994875 289.389750 yeah 
sw3204A-ms98-a-0057 289.389750 294.169125 well [noise] i- i think we kind of are along the same lines
sw3204A-ms98-a-0058 294.169125 296.404375 [silence]
