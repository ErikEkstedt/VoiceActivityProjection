sw3274A-ms98-a-0024 78.455750 86.775250 but uh somebody i talked to last week was said they had the uh they had problems doing some of the work down there because they they really had some heat hanging on

sw3274A-ms98-a-0036 126.073250 127.439250 uh-huh
sw3274A-ms98-a-0037 127.439250 134.494250 that's very okay it's very very different than ours because_1 ours ours we get into a lot of combinations of rye and Kentucky Blue
sw3274A-ms98-a-0038 134.494250 140.625625 and uh plus the usual amount of crabgrass weeds and everything else that pops through and 
sw3274A-ms98-a-0039 140.625625 152.017875 uh but we've had an a terrible drought this year and everybody's going through the same kind of problems in fact we developed on a new lawn we developed what they call rust
sw3274A-ms98-a-0040 152.017875 161.943375 and it's a fungus which is very very rare but our whole area they're all new homes and new lawns and it was it was very
sw3274A-ms98-a-0041 161.943375 165.478000 very much in evidence this year as everything turns yellow
sw3274A-ms98-a-0042 165.478000 166.771250 [silence]
sw3274A-ms98-a-0043 166.771250 174.020375 well it just turns yellow where it shouldn't and you walk across walk across the lawn and your shoes will actually come out rust colored
sw3274A-ms98-a-0044 174.020375 178.680625 [silence]
sw3274A-ms98-a-0045 178.680625 188.508250 no it's it's a fungus and they claim that it is caused by stress to the lawn it it won't kill the lawn but it sure doesn't do much for the looks of the lawn
sw3274A-ms98-a-0046 188.508250 194.536625 and uh the alternative is a lot of uh nitrogen overpowering with nitrogen fertilizer and
sw3274A-ms98-a-0047 194.536625 203.908250 certain chemicals but everybody is so chemical shy anymore that we steered clear of it and hopefully you know come s[pring]- come spring it will be cleared up and everything will be back to normal
