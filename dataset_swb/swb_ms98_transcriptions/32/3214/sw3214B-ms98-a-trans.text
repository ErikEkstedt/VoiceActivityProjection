sw3214B-ms98-a-0015 40.157875 52.848375 well i actually take Country Living it's a country magazine and House Beautiful because i like um that kind of stuff decorating and uh getting ideas for a garden in fact uh right before you called i was planning my tulips
sw3214B-ms98-a-0016 52.848375 65.763875 and uh putting them on blue print on where i'm gonna put them_1 so i'm really into that but uh so i really get into magazines that are kind of basically into um housing type things whether it be
sw3214B-ms98-a-0017 65.763875 74.218500 decorating and gardening and recipes that kind of stuff so i'm pretty much in the same category as what you're looking at
sw3214B-ms98-a-0018 74.218500 77.496375 [silence]
sw3214B-ms98-a-0019 77.496375 78.912875 um-hum

sw3214B-ms98-a-0024 86.640000 88.140250 [silence]
sw3214B-ms98-a-0025 88.140250 94.180750 yeah yeah w[e]- i've had Time before i think with that what happens is uh
sw3214B-ms98-a-0026 94.180750 103.585125 it's interesting to read but you kind of just put the magazine away and you never read it again unless there's some big article in there that you're gonna keep for your kids but
sw3214B-ms98-a-0027 103.585125 105.512625 [silence]
sw3214B-ms98-a-0028 105.512625 107.298625 um-hum
sw3214B-ms98-a-0029 107.298625 114.097375 it exactly y[ou]- you sound exactly like what we did we just saved everything we could for our daughter but uh
sw3214B-ms98-a-0030 114.097375 128.313375 that's pretty similar but i find that with these Country magazines i keep going back to them getting ideas looking back and saying jeez there was a flower garden in there that i seen that i would like to have some ideas you know so you get a lot of ideas from them
sw3214B-ms98-a-0031 128.313375 129.936000 [silence]
sw3214B-ms98-a-0032 129.936000 143.008750 yes we do we're out in the country we're right across from a river and uh you're right the leaves are beautiful and they are falling now so uh it just peaked uh last week and it was just gorgeous out here but
sw3214B-ms98-a-0033 143.008750 152.709750 yeah it's beautiful the other thing about magazines the only thing i don't like is they really get heavily into advertising and you know it's it's
sw3214B-ms98-a-0034 152.709750 158.778000 it's fine i'd rather almost have i know that part probably half their money comes from these people that are saying
sw3214B-ms98-a-0035 158.778000 170.126250 uh put my ad in your paper and i'll pay you or whatever but uh there's been some magazines i've looked at and it's a real turn off to see every other page uh some kind of ad
sw3214B-ms98-a-0036 170.126250 181.279625 yeah Vogue is heavily into that you kn[ow]- yeah exactly it's al[most]- i mean you could go into a store and get bombarded the same way but uh
sw3214B-ms98-a-0037 181.279625 183.695750 [silence]

sw3214B-ms98-a-0043 192.788125 206.204500 [laughter-exactly] yeah they're really getting into that so but pretty much like it said the magazines i've had Better Homes and Garden and now i need a switch and i'm going back to Gourmet Cooking because um i've had the magazine
sw3214B-ms98-a-0044 206.204500 215.068500 before back in nineteen uh eighty six and i thought well i'll give it a try again because you get tired of one magazine and you need to try and change
sw3214B-ms98-a-0045 215.068500 217.108000 [silence]
sw3214B-ms98-a-0046 217.108000 227.525625 uh yes i do and sometimes most of the time i tear them_1 out a lot of times if uh you know if i got a chance to sit down at my typewriter i'll go ahead and type out recipes but
sw3214B-ms98-a-0047 227.525625 238.911375 what i usually do is i'll try it out in the magazine first and uh without tearing it out and then give it a yeah and then if we like it it becomes part of the recipe collection but uh
sw3214B-ms98-a-0048 238.911375 242.203500 [silence]

sw3214B-ms98-a-0056 262.035250 276.119000 yeah it it that's what i- i just went through uh we just recently moved from Minnesota to Wisconsin i went through all this i had this huge stack of House Beautiful i had Colonial Times i had Gourmet
sw3214B-ms98-a-0057 276.119000 277.373500 yeah
sw3214B-ms98-a-0058 277.373500 288.365125 it was hard but i ended up uh reducing them down to like fifteen magazines out of uh hundreds and i just said okay there's one picture in there that it really doesn't
sw3214B-ms98-a-0059 288.365125 298.466000 you know it's got to have more than that it's got to have some good ideas it's got to have everything so i just kind of went through and i find that most of the magazines i really like is around Christmas time because it helps me [vocalized-noise]
