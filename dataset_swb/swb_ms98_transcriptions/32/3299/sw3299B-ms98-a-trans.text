sw3299B-ms98-a-0007 32.334750 47.057875 yeah we don't we don't uh [vocalized-noise] we didn't when we first got married uh i've been married only about four years my wife always wanted to write something down and keep track and i said look Mary [noise] i said you you get money we should save a little bit
sw3299B-ms98-a-0008 47.057875 55.380875 and uh whatever else you know play it by ear go spend on whatever you spend it on and if at the end of the month

sw3299B-ms98-a-0010 62.133625 70.868125 um and since then we've both been done pretty well regarding uh raises and stuff at our jobs and and our rent has stayed relatively low
sw3299B-ms98-a-0011 70.868125 76.949750 and now we haven't had that problem yet and then my we we just had our first child about two months ago
sw3299B-ms98-a-0012 76.949750 85.952875 and then i said well we'll see what happens then because sh[e]- she had to take some time off work and she probably will even quit her job now and maybe do some part time work
sw3299B-ms98-a-0013 85.952875 95.005250 but we still haven't had a problem paying the [laughter-rent] [laughter-so] [laughter-i] [laughter-don't] [laughter-know] [laughter-what] [laughter-the] i guess i'm blessed in the sense that i have a good enough job that i don't have to worry about that
sw3299B-ms98-a-0014 95.005250 102.446250 yeah i live in Manhattan i work out in Queens oh which is also part of New York City there's just five boroughs

sw3299B-ms98-a-0021 197.126000 202.279375 and uh you know in in your i don't know how how much older you['re]- i'm thirty an[d]-
sw3299B-ms98-a-0022 202.279375 214.178375 yeah uh you're generation has gotten pretty lucky regarding or at least in this area regarding real estate you know they went and bought a house for fourteen thousand dollars and then they they were sixty years old and retired
sw3299B-ms98-a-0023 214.178375 217.671625 and sold that same house for two hundred fifty thousand dollars and
sw3299B-ms98-a-0024 217.671625 228.879750 you know moved down to Florida or did whatever they had to do but they had all this capital um i don't know if the real estate market's gonna say the same for one thing i'm thirty i'm an attorney and uh i don't own a house
