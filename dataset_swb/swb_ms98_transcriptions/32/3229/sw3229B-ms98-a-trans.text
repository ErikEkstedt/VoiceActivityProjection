sw3229B-ms98-a-0022 60.929875 64.123500 [silence]
sw3229B-ms98-a-0023 64.123500 69.350000 well i- i- i think we come from from different backgrounds um so the the
sw3229B-ms98-a-0024 69.350000 80.046875 i- i- i start with different you know have different perspectives that you are i find the Joy of Cooking to be a remarkably useful book to to fall back on because it has almost everything in it
sw3229B-ms98-a-0025 80.046875 86.339750 but on the other hand [noise] it's not very inspiring uh it's a good reference when you need to dig something up
sw3229B-ms98-a-0026 86.339750 94.156875 what we've find very useful is a a book called The Thirty Minute Cookbook i think that's the title uh by Marion Burrows 
sw3229B-ms98-a-0027 94.156875 100.773875 uh which has recipes which allegedly can all be prepared in thirty minutes you know the whole meal
sw3229B-ms98-a-0028 100.773875 102.367625 and so she's
sw3229B-ms98-a-0029 102.367625 109.897250 yeah now now i- i find that the cutting up of the food and all that really makes it take a little longer than thirty minutes
sw3229B-ms98-a-0030 109.897250 110.973125 [silence]
sw3229B-ms98-a-0031 110.973125 116.972375 but but they're but they're but they're interesting they're interesting menus um
sw3229B-ms98-a-0032 116.972375 120.270125 combinations that you wouldn't have normally thought of
sw3229B-ms98-a-0033 120.270125 121.691375 um
sw3229B-ms98-a-0034 121.691375 122.722125 [silence]
sw3229B-ms98-a-0035 122.722125 134.776500 um gee the one i had most recently was was one that wa[s]- ha[d]- [vocalized-noise] she she describes as Jim Beard's favorite um summer menu or something and it consisted of
sw3229B-ms98-a-0036 134.776500 140.730250 uh grilled kielbasa sausage um a
sw3229B-ms98-a-0037 140.730250 143.794250 potato salad with olive oil
sw3229B-ms98-a-0038 143.794250 152.066000 and uh some tomatoes that had been chopped up with onions and curry powder and probably some yogurt was in there
sw3229B-ms98-a-0039 152.066000 157.148500 um and that and that was you know that's that that's certain you can do in thirty minutes
sw3229B-ms98-a-0040 157.148500 164.641750 but there are a whole lot of you know i mean i- i would recommend you look at that book if you're if you are a busy person Thirty Minute Cookbook

sw3229B-ms98-a-0054 213.412125 220.453625 put here here the inspiration was a combination of Julia Child for the dessert
sw3229B-ms98-a-0055 220.453625 223.000250 well you know a chocolate mousse recipe
sw3229B-ms98-a-0056 223.000250 227.340625 and a sort of palate cookbook which has a recipe for a thing called chicken Marabella
sw3229B-ms98-a-0057 227.340625 231.492375 um which is this wonderful thing you can do um
sw3229B-ms98-a-0058 231.492375 232.955375 [silence]
sw3229B-ms98-a-0059 232.955375 245.500750 basically you're bak[ing]- baking chicken in a in an open pan um having marinated it first hand my my wife did this part so i don't remember all the details but it's marinated in olive oil and some seasoning
sw3229B-ms98-a-0060 245.500750 255.771500 um and cooked with some olives and some and some prunes uh there's a little bit of brown sugar in there and it bakes up it's a delicious thing and it's easy
sw3229B-ms98-a-0061 255.771500 258.198625 comparatively so i
sw3229B-ms98-a-0062 258.198625 259.957875 um

sw3229B-ms98-a-0071 281.942375 287.446625 on the other hand sometimes it was easy they'd you know canned ravioli was was one of their favorites and so it was easy to
sw3229B-ms98-a-0072 287.446625 289.631250 open a can of ravioli or
