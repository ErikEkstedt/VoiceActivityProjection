sw3297B-ms98-a-0002 0.096250 1.311000 [silence]
sw3297B-ms98-a-0003 1.311000 2.489875 [laughter]
sw3297B-ms98-a-0004 2.489875 4.334750 [silence]
sw3297B-ms98-a-0005 4.334750 5.733875 [noise]
sw3297B-ms98-a-0006 5.733875 7.195125 [silence]
sw3297B-ms98-a-0007 7.195125 13.781750 i got rid of mine about uh oh it's been about four years ago now
sw3297B-ms98-a-0008 13.781750 18.350000 and uh went on a strictly cash basis
sw3297B-ms98-a-0009 18.350000 20.339875 and
sw3297B-ms98-a-0010 20.339875 24.859125 uh sometimes it's inconvenient but
sw3297B-ms98-a-0011 24.859125 27.950875 it is so much better for me
sw3297B-ms98-a-0012 27.950875 29.072625 [silence]
sw3297B-ms98-a-0013 29.072625 31.161750 because i
sw3297B-ms98-a-0014 31.161750 37.037125 i am the type that will always find an [laughter-emergency]
sw3297B-ms98-a-0015 37.037125 44.590750 but i have found that there were so many things that with a credit card you know i really did need
sw3297B-ms98-a-0016 44.590750 53.930625 and with cash once you know it took me probably two years to get on a cash basis when i stopped charging
sw3297B-ms98-a-0017 53.930625 64.105250 but once once i did you know it it only takes me two or three months to be able to save up what i want to buy
sw3297B-ms98-a-0018 64.105250 67.902125 and i'm not paying the high interest rates
sw3297B-ms98-a-0019 67.902125 69.297875 [silence]
sw3297B-ms98-a-0020 69.297875 78.138000 because it's so easy you know you have these wonderful intentions of well i'll just pay off the whole balance and then i won't owe any
sw3297B-ms98-a-0021 78.138000 85.632375 and then something comes up you know and well i'll just pay the minimum well you just do that forever
sw3297B-ms98-a-0022 85.632375 89.778000 [silence]
sw3297B-ms98-a-0023 89.778000 92.001750 no you're paying interest
sw3297B-ms98-a-0024 92.001750 105.926125 [silence]
sw3297B-ms98-a-0025 105.926125 114.508875 you know i've i've thought about going ahead and getting something like American Express where you have to pay within thirty days
sw3297B-ms98-a-0026 114.508875 115.629125 [silence]
sw3297B-ms98-a-0027 115.629125 119.927750 right and just for ID purposes
sw3297B-ms98-a-0028 119.927750 123.570125 but it's become such a way of life
sw3297B-ms98-a-0029 123.570125 124.764250 [silence]
sw3297B-ms98-a-0030 124.764250 126.066750 and
sw3297B-ms98-a-0031 126.066750 129.276250 like i say it was so convenient
sw3297B-ms98-a-0032 129.276250 133.414000 and then pretty soon you get a consolidation loan
sw3297B-ms98-a-0033 133.414000 138.626500 to consolidate all your credit cards and then they send you another credit card
sw3297B-ms98-a-0034 138.626500 140.505125 [silence]
sw3297B-ms98-a-0035 140.505125 142.580625 uh right
sw3297B-ms98-a-0036 142.580625 144.213125 [silence]
sw3297B-ms98-a-0037 144.213125 153.212000 so i i just finally figured out that for my way of life i did much better and i've 
sw3297B-ms98-a-0038 153.212000 157.054125 i've been able to buy as much or more
sw3297B-ms98-a-0039 157.054125 165.175125 by just going cash and like i say it was tough because it's a really it's a habit
sw3297B-ms98-a-0040 165.175125 168.505500 [silence]
sw3297B-ms98-a-0041 168.505500 178.569500 or you know you'll think okay i've got x amounts to spend this month and then somebody has a birthday or get they get married or something
sw3297B-ms98-a-0042 178.569500 187.925125 you think well i'll just put this one thing on it well you don't do that once you start you know you're going to have a bill coming in anyway
sw3297B-ms98-a-0043 187.925125 194.656000 [silence]
sw3297B-ms98-a-0044 194.656000 196.807000 right
sw3297B-ms98-a-0045 196.807000 205.718000 and i i just you know for for me it was a trap that was too easy for me to get into
sw3297B-ms98-a-0046 205.718000 224.999125 [silence]
sw3297B-ms98-a-0047 224.999125 226.527625 uh-huh
sw3297B-ms98-a-0048 226.527625 231.292125 [silence]
sw3297B-ms98-a-0049 231.292125 233.983625 well you know there are times when
sw3297B-ms98-a-0050 233.983625 238.001625 you know it is but i i've been
sw3297B-ms98-a-0051 238.001625 245.493875 laid off twice in the last four years and had i had a lot of credit cards
sw3297B-ms98-a-0052 245.493875 246.502375 [silence]
sw3297B-ms98-a-0053 246.502375 259.041375 i w[ould]- well you know it it really helped that i didn't have that to pay for but in the other vein had i had them_1 i would have lived on them_1
sw3297B-ms98-a-0054 259.041375 261.626125 [silence]
sw3297B-ms98-a-0055 261.626125 263.465750 right
sw3297B-ms98-a-0056 263.465750 267.911750 and uh this way you know i i made do
sw3297B-ms98-a-0057 267.911750 269.844375 and uh
sw3297B-ms98-a-0058 269.844375 280.353000 when i was you know employed then i didn't have all that that i had to go back and say well i've got ten thousand dollars worth of credit cards to pay off now
sw3297B-ms98-a-0059 280.353000 282.557250 [silence]
sw3297B-ms98-a-0060 282.557250 293.320500 it really you know with the first like i say it took me over two years to pay mine off but the first time you know that i could go out and make a major purchase
sw3297B-ms98-a-0061 293.320500 294.716250 [silence]
sw3297B-ms98-a-0062 294.716250 296.443625 and pay cash
sw3297B-ms98-a-0063 296.443625 299.330000 it was a real good feeling
