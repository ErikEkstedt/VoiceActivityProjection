sw3201A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 2.932500 [noise] so do you have any recycling programs there
sw3201A-ms98-a-0002 2.932500 8.056750 [silence]
sw3201A-ms98-a-0003 8.056750 9.535000 uh-huh
sw3201A-ms98-a-0004 9.535000 15.573875 [silence]
sw3201A-ms98-a-0005 15.573875 17.290625 oh uh-huh
sw3201A-ms98-a-0006 17.290625 19.808750 [silence]
sw3201A-ms98-a-0007 19.808750 21.497875 yeah
sw3201A-ms98-a-0008 21.497875 27.099625 we've progressed a little bit farther than that um actually they have uh parts of town
sw3201A-ms98-a-0009 27.099625 32.819000 it may have even spread all over the whole town and um they have these green bins
sw3201A-ms98-a-0010 32.819000 39.233250 and it's just as standard as a a regular trash can that they come by and pick up and dump
sw3201A-ms98-a-0011 39.233250 47.361000 and uh just along with a trash can you have this this green plastic bin and you put your bottles in it and paper
sw3201A-ms98-a-0012 47.361000 54.835000 and um you know all those things that [vocalized-noise] aluminum you know anything that can be recycled you just put in that bin
sw3201A-ms98-a-0013 54.835000 58.627750 and uh i guess you can al[so]- and a lot of the restaurants
sw3201A-ms98-a-0014 58.627750 63.620250 they just have uh places where you can throw away especially beer places
sw3201A-ms98-a-0015 63.620250 69.261250 where you can throw away green bottles and then the brown bottles and uh
sw3201A-ms98-a-0016 69.261250 76.173500 [noise] oh i don't know i guess they're you know clear bottles so um you know a lot of people do have those separated
sw3201A-ms98-a-0017 76.173500 81.356375 and of course they have the um dumpsters uh the the igloos
sw3201A-ms98-a-0018 81.356375 86.273500 uh and they have those strateg[ically]- strategically placed around the city
sw3201A-ms98-a-0019 86.273500 93.141000 and uh they're they're actually gonna extend it i think one of these days maybe to apartment complexes and uh
sw3201A-ms98-a-0020 93.141000 100.472250 yeah things of that nature so i guess when you live in a bigger city it it really becomes uh necessary
sw3201A-ms98-a-0021 100.472250 103.962750 [silence]
sw3201A-ms98-a-0022 103.962750 105.522625 [noise]
sw3201A-ms98-a-0023 105.522625 107.140375 oh yeah
sw3201A-ms98-a-0024 107.140375 112.207750 [silence]
sw3201A-ms98-a-0025 112.207750 113.739375 uh-huh
sw3201A-ms98-a-0026 113.739375 115.416250 yeah
sw3201A-ms98-a-0027 115.416250 117.263000 [silence]
sw3201A-ms98-a-0028 117.263000 119.741750 oh really hm
sw3201A-ms98-a-0029 119.741750 120.790375 [silence]
sw3201A-ms98-a-0030 120.790375 127.250250 yeah i remember my grandparents and i used to always get out there on the road and pick up beer cans and uh [noise]
sw3201A-ms98-a-0031 127.250250 141.336500 [silence]
sw3201A-ms98-a-0032 141.336500 142.721625 uh-huh
sw3201A-ms98-a-0033 142.721625 147.661750 [silence]
sw3201A-ms98-a-0034 147.661750 155.649375 [noise] yeah they're doing a real good job of uh separating it here and of course there you know you have a specific place to put your paper
sw3201A-ms98-a-0035 155.649375 164.487375 and uh they try to get you to go ahead and separate it but uh they actually have the door to door pickup um and it's uh i think it started out to be um
sw3201A-ms98-a-0036 164.487375 174.701250 just kind of a test a pilot project and it went over so well that they just extended it and it's almost uh i don't know if it's done by a private company or not it may be
sw3201A-ms98-a-0037 174.701250 178.913500 but uh they just go around to each uh door and pick it up
sw3201A-ms98-a-0038 178.913500 180.609750 yeah
sw3201A-ms98-a-0039 180.609750 184.717250 let's see oh and every year of course the phone books
sw3201A-ms98-a-0040 184.717250 192.239375 um they tell everybody across the city to um put all their phone books in uh the uh recycle bins
sw3201A-ms98-a-0041 192.239375 198.949250 because you know phone books are pretty well for a bigger city they're pretty thick an[d]- and sometimes you might have two or three
sw3201A-ms98-a-0042 198.949250 203.627625 so uh that's that's a big savings right there in itself
sw3201A-ms98-a-0043 203.627625 205.829375 yeah hm
sw3201A-ms98-a-0044 205.829375 212.824000 [silence]
sw3201A-ms98-a-0045 212.824000 214.099250 um-hum
sw3201A-ms98-a-0046 214.099250 217.973125 [silence]
sw3201A-ms98-a-0047 217.973125 224.898375 um-hum well the thing about newspapers and paper recycled paper is actually very expensive [laughter]
sw3201A-ms98-a-0048 224.898375 233.446375 so when you see something that's on recycled paper they've actually gone to a lot of expense to do that it's uh they're not coming out ahead at all
sw3201A-ms98-a-0049 233.446375 236.136500 it's uh it's really a cost
sw3201A-ms98-a-0050 236.136500 237.512375 [silence]
sw3201A-ms98-a-0051 237.512375 238.919000 yeah
sw3201A-ms98-a-0052 238.919000 248.210625 i mean it it sounds good to the public but there's really a big cost incurred when you do recycle something now aluminum i don't know they may be coming out ahead
sw3201A-ms98-a-0053 248.210625 250.332625 but i know for a fact that the paper
sw3201A-ms98-a-0054 250.332625 259.776750 uh on that end they're not [laughter] you know it's it's good to recycle but it's uh not to their advantage and it costs less
sw3201A-ms98-a-0055 259.776750 264.154375 [silence]
sw3201A-ms98-a-0056 264.154375 267.998250 i can't think of anything else [laughter-okay]
sw3201A-ms98-a-0057 267.998250 270.045250 [silence]
sw3201A-ms98-a-0058 270.045250 271.494000 uh-huh
sw3201A-ms98-a-0059 271.494000 276.416000 well i hope y'all um uh come along a little farther in the future
sw3201A-ms98-a-0060 276.416000 281.602000 it was nice talking to you bye-bye [noise]
