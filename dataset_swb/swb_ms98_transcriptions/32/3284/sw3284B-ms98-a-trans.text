sw3284B-ms98-a-0004 25.843750 28.971250 [silence]
sw3284B-ms98-a-0005 28.971250 30.331750 yeah i don't kn[ow]-
sw3284B-ms98-a-0006 30.331750 33.389875 [silence]
sw3284B-ms98-a-0007 33.389875 35.315125 yeah i believe that's right
sw3284B-ms98-a-0008 35.315125 41.806875 and uh [noise] and i don't know that that's really what we're talking about uh
sw3284B-ms98-a-0009 41.806875 64.565250 [silence]
sw3284B-ms98-a-0010 64.565250 69.228375 yeah for for kids in high school it could be in the summertime
sw3284B-ms98-a-0011 69.228375 70.568500 [silence]
sw3284B-ms98-a-0012 70.568500 72.041500 uh
sw3284B-ms98-a-0013 72.041500 74.197000 you know um
sw3284B-ms98-a-0014 74.197000 79.359500 it it could even be done while they're doing another job while they're doing you know a job to make money
sw3284B-ms98-a-0015 79.359500 80.605750 [silence]
sw3284B-ms98-a-0016 80.605750 91.551250 but uh [noise] it's uh you know such a grassroots idea that it it i think the family would have to be involved in it and and people would have to be convinced that
sw3284B-ms98-a-0017 91.551250 99.346750 you know i i think the the basic message is that giving is better than receiving [laughter]
sw3284B-ms98-a-0018 99.346750 102.528750 and that's not the kind of society we have right now
sw3284B-ms98-a-0019 102.528750 117.042125 [silence]
sw3284B-ms98-a-0020 117.042125 121.533250 yeah there are lots and lots of volunteer programs and um
sw3284B-ms98-a-0021 121.533250 123.861250 [noise] but most of those are
sw3284B-ms98-a-0022 123.861250 129.489250 at l[east]- at least it it's my opinion that most of those involve uh adults
sw3284B-ms98-a-0023 129.489250 134.312750 adults who have the time to give and and uh you know the desire
sw3284B-ms98-a-0024 134.312750 135.819500 to to give
sw3284B-ms98-a-0025 135.819500 136.825625 [silence]
sw3284B-ms98-a-0026 136.825625 139.126250 it's not uh [noise]
sw3284B-ms98-a-0027 139.126250 141.147500 [silence]
sw3284B-ms98-a-0028 141.147500 147.715125 you know it's not uh maybe th[e]- maybe it cou[ld]- uh younger people feel like it's not open to them i don't know
sw3284B-ms98-a-0029 147.715125 148.793875 [silence]
sw3284B-ms98-a-0030 148.793875 151.271125 b[ut]- but it should be if it's not
sw3284B-ms98-a-0031 151.271125 163.662125 [silence]
sw3284B-ms98-a-0032 163.662125 173.478750 yeah it is kind of an introspective time of life but some schoo[ls]- some high schools [vocalized-noise] have actually started a program of like a visitation program to
sw3284B-ms98-a-0033 173.478750 175.469000 uh
sw3284B-ms98-a-0034 175.469000 178.484500 you know areas economically uh
sw3284B-ms98-a-0035 178.484500 181.515125 [silence]
sw3284B-ms98-a-0036 181.515125 186.106375 say less advantaged areas and uh
sw3284B-ms98-a-0037 186.106375 188.927875 they they promote service
sw3284B-ms98-a-0038 188.927875 192.835375 on the part of the kids to to uh some of those people
sw3284B-ms98-a-0039 192.835375 197.753750 so at least that's a step in the right direction i guess
sw3284B-ms98-a-0040 197.753750 217.547625 [silence]
sw3284B-ms98-a-0041 217.547625 222.094125 yeah it's really it's really unfortunate because [noise] when you do
sw3284B-ms98-a-0042 222.094125 226.546000 i do volunteer work for [noise] the American Lung Association
sw3284B-ms98-a-0043 226.546000 235.508500 and i have have done uh gone to work for American Heart and just recently for the Leukemia Society
sw3284B-ms98-a-0044 235.508500 243.106500 and there's there's no question that doing you know doing that kind of service you get a lot more out of it than uh than the people involved
sw3284B-ms98-a-0045 243.106500 250.352750 uh it's it's really a gift to yourself and and that's i think that's a r[eally]- a really important lesson to learn
sw3284B-ms98-a-0046 250.352750 256.041125 an[d]- and and maybe that's why we have so many people in society who are not uh not really happy
sw3284B-ms98-a-0047 256.041125 257.446750 you know
sw3284B-ms98-a-0048 257.446750 264.962875 because_1 i[f]- [noise] if you concentrate all of your energies and efforts on yourself you're just kind of down the tube [laughter-you] [laughter-know]
sw3284B-ms98-a-0049 264.962875 269.330000 uh [vocalized-noise] really is better to give then to receive [noise]
sw3284B-ms98-a-0050 269.330000 298.850000 [silence]
