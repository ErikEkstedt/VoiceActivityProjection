sw3203B-ms98-a-0053 213.434625 219.714875 we've been very pleased with it we've had no major problems with it knock on wood [laughter] and uh
sw3203B-ms98-a-0054 219.714875 232.515625 you know it is with huh withstood you know two children growing up and now three grandsons roaming through it all the time so and we like our neighborhood it it has has grown and the majority of the people you know keep up the neighborhood
sw3203B-ms98-a-0055 232.515625 237.421625 and that's very important and and as i said it it has ris[en]- risen in value
sw3203B-ms98-a-0056 237.421625 250.309000 but we bought back when housing was so low and you know and now i[t]- you know it then it started jumping by leaps and bounds it seems to have leveled off and actually dropped back down a little bit but we're still fine
sw3203B-ms98-a-0057 250.309000 253.063250 uh-huh uh-huh

sw3203B-ms98-a-0063 267.320875 276.351000 uh-huh i think once the economic situation in the Dallas area improves i think housing will go up
sw3203B-ms98-a-0064 276.351000 286.000625 you know right now there's a lot on the market for sale because of people having lost their jobs and everything so that's you know that keeps the prices down
sw3203B-ms98-a-0065 286.000625 294.473750 and value down and i sure the tax uh or appraisal district would like for it to go up [laughter]
sw3203B-ms98-a-0066 294.473750 299.522000 that's [laughter-right] that's right [laughter]
