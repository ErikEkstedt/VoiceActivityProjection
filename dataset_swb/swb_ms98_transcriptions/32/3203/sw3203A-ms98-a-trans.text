sw3203A-ms98-a-0008 22.144125 25.473500 and it's probably typical of your neighborhood
sw3203A-ms98-a-0009 25.473500 27.743250 [silence]
sw3203A-ms98-a-0010 27.743250 31.614375 i'm in Plano just you know north of where you live
sw3203A-ms98-a-0011 31.614375 39.500125 and uh we live near Coit and Legacy in a relatively new development that just has gone in about two years ago
sw3203A-ms98-a-0012 39.500125 40.645875 [silence]
sw3203A-ms98-a-0013 40.645875 49.698250 so my home is typical it's a a brick home a two story brick home and it's typical of of the other homes in our neighborhood too
sw3203A-ms98-a-0014 49.698250 54.285250 [silence]
sw3203A-ms98-a-0015 54.285250 55.684875 yeah

sw3203A-ms98-a-0017 57.106375 65.134625 yeah the the one thing we did do instead of having a twenty foot living room ceiling we're from the north and we just couldn't stand the wasted space
sw3203A-ms98-a-0018 65.134625 74.953750 so we had them_1 we have a high entry hall and then we had them level off our living room and dining room ceiling to um nine feet so we could get bedrooms above
sw3203A-ms98-a-0019 74.953750 75.956750 [silence]
sw3203A-ms98-a-0020 75.956750 83.427125 so that way we we sort of have the entryway that looks typical of the area but we don't have so much wasted space
sw3203A-ms98-a-0021 83.427125 86.983125 and we could get more bedrooms per square foot that way
sw3203A-ms98-a-0022 86.983125 92.552000 [silence]

sw3203A-ms98-a-0041 171.469750 179.147625 we noticed a tremendous difference up north they just kind of throw them together because_1 we had homes built in in Detroit also
sw3203A-ms98-a-0042 179.147625 184.403750 and they just didn't care if the trim work didn't line up it's just that's just what you get [laughter]
