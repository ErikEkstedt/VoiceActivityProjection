sw3200B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 3.258750 [noise]
sw3200B-ms98-a-0002 3.258750 10.878750 no i- i never keep a budget my budget or philosophy i guess is is spend as little as possible
sw3200B-ms98-a-0003 10.878750 17.106125 and uh and it's it's sort sort of always worked
sw3200B-ms98-a-0004 17.106125 21.408250 uh but that depends on you know on the individual if they can
sw3200B-ms98-a-0005 21.408250 23.604875 [laughter] i guess have self control
sw3200B-ms98-a-0006 23.604875 34.389125 [silence]
sw3200B-ms98-a-0007 34.389125 35.949375 um-hum
sw3200B-ms98-a-0008 35.949375 58.452500 [silence]
sw3200B-ms98-a-0009 58.452500 59.215500 uh-huh
sw3200B-ms98-a-0010 59.215500 65.645625 [silence]
sw3200B-ms98-a-0011 65.645625 67.116375 um-hum
sw3200B-ms98-a-0012 67.116375 76.113750 [silence]
sw3200B-ms98-a-0013 76.113750 77.525125 yes
sw3200B-ms98-a-0014 77.525125 85.449125 [silence]
sw3200B-ms98-a-0015 85.449125 89.277125 well yeah i- i couldn't probably be bothered d[oing]- doing that
sw3200B-ms98-a-0016 89.277125 97.744875 every month and and every since uh well we've been married almost thirty years now but um m[y]- my husband got paid once a month
sw3200B-ms98-a-0017 97.744875 105.791125 so [laughter] you learn to get th[rough]- [laughter] you learn to get through you know to the end of the month and uh
sw3200B-ms98-a-0018 105.791125 109.972375 [silence]
sw3200B-ms98-a-0019 109.972375 123.760875 no no because if you charge things and uh you pay all your bills at the beginning of the month when you get paid or you get paid the last day or next to the last day you pay all your bills then there isn't anything left to spend anyway
sw3200B-ms98-a-0020 123.760875 125.854750 [laughter]
sw3200B-ms98-a-0021 125.854750 128.209125 [silence]
sw3200B-ms98-a-0022 128.209125 129.851625 um-hum
sw3200B-ms98-a-0023 129.851625 134.092125 [silence]
sw3200B-ms98-a-0024 134.092125 137.513625 well yeah we we tried to to
sw3200B-ms98-a-0025 137.513625 148.607000 t[o]- or we are paying them_1 off now or there was a time when maybe we didn't pay all of them_1 off but you just sort of had to watch what you put in because you you hate to pay those finance charges when you see how much it is
sw3200B-ms98-a-0026 148.607000 158.929375 and for most of uh i mean i'm a substitute teacher and i've only substituted i guess for the last fifteen years so there's only been really one working [noise] and uh [noise]
sw3200B-ms98-a-0027 158.929375 164.526250 it it works for me but i can't see that it it would work for probably the majority of people
sw3200B-ms98-a-0028 164.526250 169.580750 [silence]
sw3200B-ms98-a-0029 169.580750 170.951750 yeah
sw3200B-ms98-a-0030 170.951750 172.505750 [silence]
sw3200B-ms98-a-0031 172.505750 173.509000 [noise]
sw3200B-ms98-a-0032 173.509000 187.980000 [silence]
sw3200B-ms98-a-0033 187.980000 190.236375 um-hum yeah
sw3200B-ms98-a-0034 190.236375 193.430125 um-hum it it is when you do it that way
sw3200B-ms98-a-0035 193.430125 204.281250 [silence]
sw3200B-ms98-a-0036 204.281250 217.371625 well we we eat out a a good deal at this point i- i started subbing just to go on a vacation and saved all that money so because i knew that you couldn't you know spending five thousand dollars on a vacation or whatever we were gonna go for ten weeks
sw3200B-ms98-a-0037 217.371625 229.480000 ah in nineteen eighty so i started working in nineteen eighty seven and just saved for three years but the [laughter-what] minuscule amount i made but that way you just didn't put it on your credit card and and it was paid for
sw3200B-ms98-a-0038 229.480000 241.491875 yes and so i think that that's difficult for most people but then my father was very Scotch and you know you never could afford anything although he could afford everything if he wanted to um
sw3200B-ms98-a-0039 241.491875 245.134000 [silence]
sw3200B-ms98-a-0040 245.134000 246.558875 yes
sw3200B-ms98-a-0041 246.558875 250.557375 [silence]
sw3200B-ms98-a-0042 250.557375 256.469125 and i never worried about saving money because we just we're in the savings plan at work and they took it out so
sw3200B-ms98-a-0043 256.469125 257.967500 i uh
sw3200B-ms98-a-0044 257.967500 261.381500 [silence]
sw3200B-ms98-a-0045 261.381500 262.729125 um-hum
sw3200B-ms98-a-0046 262.729125 268.035125 well we never had too much of that but then we never had any really emergencies that uh
sw3200B-ms98-a-0047 268.035125 275.797500 and we didn't buy really new or expensive cars i think the most my we're looking at cars now uh we ever spent for a new car was like six thousand dollars
sw3200B-ms98-a-0048 275.797500 278.232000 and they were mainly used cars
sw3200B-ms98-a-0049 278.232000 282.707250 [silence]
sw3200B-ms98-a-0050 282.707250 288.054125 yeah so you know we've been [laughter-rather] rather frugal in that
sw3200B-ms98-a-0051 288.054125 289.323750 [silence]
sw3200B-ms98-a-0052 289.323750 291.499375 in that respect yeah
sw3200B-ms98-a-0053 291.499375 294.717375 [silence]
sw3200B-ms98-a-0054 294.717375 299.522000 [noise] well ea[ch]- each time they used to call in and tell me their space is limited and to please uh
