sw3200A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 4.155500 [noise] okay i'll let you start do you all keep a budget and how do you hold to yours [laughter]
sw3200A-ms98-a-0002 4.155500 7.883750 [silence]
sw3200A-ms98-a-0003 7.883750 9.247000 um-hum
sw3200A-ms98-a-0004 9.247000 13.973625 well that's that's good [laughter] especially for these times
sw3200A-ms98-a-0005 13.973625 16.374250 [silence]
sw3200A-ms98-a-0006 16.374250 17.825500 uh-huh
sw3200A-ms98-a-0007 17.825500 22.929875 [silence]
sw3200A-ms98-a-0008 22.929875 34.861750 well that's a lot of it uh i know we tried several different ways one time we tried something that really worked but we didn't keep it up i passed it on to a friend and she won't quit doing it she loves it and that was the envelope system
sw3200A-ms98-a-0009 34.861750 47.266125 where you go ahead and decide about how much based on what you did last month that you are going to spend and you put the cash in envelopes marked for that so you have one for entertainment and one for groceries and et cetera and then for some reason
sw3200A-ms98-a-0010 47.266125 51.014000 taking it out of that envelope and seeing it in cash instead of in check form
sw3200A-ms98-a-0011 51.014000 62.257750 uh causes you to realize how much is left and she even writes down on the envelope as she subtracts and kind of debits on each envelope what she's buying and then at the end of the of the period pay period
sw3200A-ms98-a-0012 62.257750 77.081500 if she has any left that much is for fun or entertainment and they kind of work it that way we tried for a while and it seems like the problem that we were having of all the of all the things that worked was not planning enough for the incidentals that we couldn't think about
sw3200A-ms98-a-0013 77.081500 85.079125 and those are the ones that will kill you you know the accident the accidental fee or the car repair or the things that weren't supposed to be every month
sw3200A-ms98-a-0014 85.079125 88.529125 [silence]
sw3200A-ms98-a-0015 88.529125 92.018875 uh-huh [noise] that's what i mean it was a hassle [laughter]
sw3200A-ms98-a-0016 92.018875 93.791750 [silence]
sw3200A-ms98-a-0017 93.791750 95.124000 um-hum
sw3200A-ms98-a-0018 95.124000 97.068125 [silence]
sw3200A-ms98-a-0019 97.068125 98.659375 um-hum
sw3200A-ms98-a-0020 98.659375 102.021000 [laughter-that's] that's kind of hard [laughter] 
sw3200A-ms98-a-0021 102.021000 104.613500 [noise]
sw3200A-ms98-a-0022 104.613500 113.969250 but do you sort of self budget even though i mean you wouldn't like on payday think boy i can go do this and that and this and that you kind of think this is got to straight you kind of divide it in fourths in a way don't you
sw3200A-ms98-a-0023 113.969250 117.821500 [silence]
sw3200A-ms98-a-0024 117.821500 119.087375 right
sw3200A-ms98-a-0025 119.087375 121.038750 [silence]
sw3200A-ms98-a-0026 121.038750 122.313875 right
sw3200A-ms98-a-0027 122.313875 123.342625 [silence]
sw3200A-ms98-a-0028 123.342625 128.909125 well that's true what we're in the process of doing right now is paying off our credit cards entirely
sw3200A-ms98-a-0029 128.909125 134.979750 and we're going to go ahead and try to just live on what we earn instead of guessing ahead of what we probably will have next [laughter-month]
sw3200A-ms98-a-0030 134.979750 137.126125 [laughter-and]
sw3200A-ms98-a-0031 137.126125 138.738250 [silence]
sw3200A-ms98-a-0032 138.738250 140.955750 yeah we're not there yet
sw3200A-ms98-a-0033 140.955750 142.192750 [silence]
sw3200A-ms98-a-0034 142.192750 143.622125 um-hum
sw3200A-ms98-a-0035 143.622125 145.765375 uh-huh
sw3200A-ms98-a-0036 145.765375 149.199250 that's right that's right
sw3200A-ms98-a-0037 149.199250 154.036000 [silence]
sw3200A-ms98-a-0038 154.036000 155.512125 um
sw3200A-ms98-a-0039 155.512125 157.864625 um-hum same here yeah
sw3200A-ms98-a-0040 157.864625 163.500375 [silence]
sw3200A-ms98-a-0041 163.500375 169.067875 well i could say it's kind of you know that's that's good you may you probably have a little extra than you have to have
sw3200A-ms98-a-0042 169.067875 177.106375 to you know what i'm saying and so that that's the difference there where sometimes like i know if we've had an especially bad month and we're just almost getting down to payday
sw3200A-ms98-a-0043 177.106375 184.562875 then i think if we could really budget we tried one ti[me]- i know when we were planning to buy the new car and we hadn't had a car payment in five years
sw3200A-ms98-a-0044 184.562875 191.167000 we had to go ahead and write down each month what it was that every penny went for to see how much was gonna be left and that was a real eye opener
sw3200A-ms98-a-0045 191.167000 199.424500 [vocalized-noise] [laughter] uh-huh but to to have lived by that every week would have been tough for me because_1 sometimes i'll spend less on groceries but we'll go out
sw3200A-ms98-a-0046 199.424500 208.102625 so it's kind of hard to say this is how much you're gonna spend going out for fun this is how much you're gonna spend it's kind of hard do you
sw3200A-ms98-a-0047 208.102625 209.526375 [silence]
sw3200A-ms98-a-0048 209.526375 211.608375 yeah yeah
sw3200A-ms98-a-0049 211.608375 213.172750 [silence]
sw3200A-ms98-a-0050 213.172750 216.689125 right [laughter] right
sw3200A-ms98-a-0051 216.689125 220.980500 oh how nice
sw3200A-ms98-a-0052 220.980500 222.990000 uh-huh
sw3200A-ms98-a-0053 222.990000 224.070125 [silence]
sw3200A-ms98-a-0054 224.070125 226.984875 [laughter] with
sw3200A-ms98-a-0055 226.984875 232.451500 well that's g[ood]- and it made a big and you enjoyed it better probably yeah [vocalized-noise]
sw3200A-ms98-a-0056 232.451500 233.853250 [silence]
sw3200A-ms98-a-0057 233.853250 236.120500 i think so too
sw3200A-ms98-a-0058 236.120500 240.230500 [silence]
sw3200A-ms98-a-0059 240.230500 251.364750 so if you're out like in a department store and there's a sale you're just real careful not to let your urges get hold of you that that's excellent that's what i'm working toward i think you're probably much ahead of me there and i'm working on it
sw3200A-ms98-a-0060 251.364750 255.049875 [silence]
sw3200A-ms98-a-0061 255.049875 264.207750 same here same here and i think though that we need to have some liquid around that you don't have to go through the company to get [laughter] you know yeah
sw3200A-ms98-a-0062 264.207750 265.716375 yeah
sw3200A-ms98-a-0063 265.716375 267.000000 [silence]
sw3200A-ms98-a-0064 267.000000 269.137750 that came up yeah
sw3200A-ms98-a-0065 269.137750 275.074250 [silence]
sw3200A-ms98-a-0066 275.074250 276.798125 uh-huh
sw3200A-ms98-a-0067 276.798125 286.025875 well that's the best thing to do my husband said the other day it was the worst mistake we ever did to buy a new car because it wasn't worth it from the day after so
sw3200A-ms98-a-0068 286.025875 295.685000 rather frugal well that that's gonna payoff on retirement yeah well it uh i guess we've completed do you think we've been here ten
sw3200A-ms98-a-0069 295.685000 299.522000 [silence]
