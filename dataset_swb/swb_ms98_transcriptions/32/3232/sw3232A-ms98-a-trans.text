sw3232A-ms98-a-0017 41.897250 47.755875 well that was one of the things i was thinking about in school um when i went to Texas Tech out in Lubbock
sw3232A-ms98-a-0018 47.755875 53.323625 [noise] and uh i had a friend my roommate went to Tech also but she was from New Mexico
sw3232A-ms98-a-0019 53.323625 60.002125 [noise] and she had to pay out of state tuition [noise] and i think that would have uh played a real big part in my decision [laughter]
sw3232A-ms98-a-0020 60.002125 60.968875 [noise]
sw3232A-ms98-a-0021 60.968875 68.353875 yeah because um she was pay[ing]- of course back then it was so much cheaper than it is now it was like four dollars a semester hour
sw3232A-ms98-a-0022 68.353875 77.617875 [noise] and so i was going to [noise] school for you know just a few hundred dollars a semester and she was paying forty dollars an hour [noise] so she's paying ten times as much because she was out of state

sw3232A-ms98-a-0039 147.761625 153.741000 send any of us to school and so uh because based on the number of children and the amount of money uh
sw3232A-ms98-a-0040 153.741000 161.235250 my father brought in i got a small grant but then after that i was on my own working and you know trying to go to school on my own

sw3232A-ms98-a-0064 240.089000 246.687125 [noise] a Christian college because i [noise] thought about attending Abilene Christian instead of Texas Tech
sw3232A-ms98-a-0065 246.687125 252.908500 and of course the price was just astronomical compared to Tech um the Christian college was so much more expensive
sw3232A-ms98-a-0066 252.908500 256.967625 [noise] but i guess some of the other co[lleges]- smaller colleges might might be a lot different
