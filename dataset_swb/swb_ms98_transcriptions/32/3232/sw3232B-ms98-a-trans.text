sw3232B-ms98-a-0064 204.785250 217.543000 uh l[ots]- the smaller schools can give you a lot uh a lot more specialized instruction and attention than the larger schools in the larger schools you get caught up in the bureaucracy and
sw3232B-ms98-a-0065 217.543000 224.302000 and they just give you a [vocalized-noise] teacher's assistants you know instead of a scholar you get a TA
sw3232B-ms98-a-0066 224.302000 233.436000 and uh you don't get near the uh quality of education [noise] and as well the uh smaller schools often times don't cost as much

sw3232B-ms98-a-0077 262.759500 273.095250 it's really a shame because of you know the instruction um i'd rather go to any other college you know in the state and i would definitely get my money's worth uh much better than State

sw3232B-ms98-a-0080 280.024625 289.242875 yeah they're they're bent on uh seeing how much land how much more land they can get and how much uh how much of the campus they can build up
sw3232B-ms98-a-0081 289.242875 293.010625 and uh yeah it's really a bad situation here
