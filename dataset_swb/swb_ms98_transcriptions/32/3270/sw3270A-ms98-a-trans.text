sw3270A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 5.042375 [noise] well i don't know if there's gonna be a solutions to the US budget
sw3270A-ms98-a-0002 5.042375 8.119625 [silence]
sw3270A-ms98-a-0003 8.119625 9.504125 um-hum
sw3270A-ms98-a-0004 9.504125 11.073375 [silence]
sw3270A-ms98-a-0005 11.073375 13.638125 yes exactly
sw3270A-ms98-a-0006 13.638125 22.465250 there's uh maybe some short term things that they can do and it hurts everybody's pocket of course but um i know that state
sw3270A-ms98-a-0007 22.465250 28.087625 has uh cutback uh raises for a year to help uh
sw3270A-ms98-a-0008 28.087625 34.419375 the uh state financial or whatever you might want to say to get better in a better condition that
sw3270A-ms98-a-0009 34.419375 36.347125 uh state of Minnesota
sw3270A-ms98-a-0010 36.347125 39.092750 so there's the potential that perhaps
sw3270A-ms98-a-0011 39.092750 43.283875 you know the US budget might wanna take a look at it's uh federal
sw3270A-ms98-a-0012 43.283875 47.569500 employees or and take a look at saying well let's freeze
sw3270A-ms98-a-0013 47.569500 59.893250 wages i mean everybody's doing it so it isn't like uh private business has had to do it so it might have to be something that they might consider doing as a [shirt/short] that's got to be very short term
sw3270A-ms98-a-0014 59.893250 67.357875 a[nd]- and the only other avenue that i can think of is um looking at where they're spending the money and not so much as
sw3270A-ms98-a-0015 67.357875 75.263875 saying [noise] well we're spending too much in that area as perhaps looking at what is costing them the moneys uh
sw3270A-ms98-a-0016 75.263875 84.421750 for for instance i think you probably remember the military getting caught um with toilet seats that cost them_1 four hundred five hundred dollars
sw3270A-ms98-a-0017 84.421750 93.091250 and it was just [laughter-i] [laughter-mean] you can go to Kmart and buy them_1 for uh eight dollars or i think six dollars or whatever for toilet seats so
sw3270A-ms98-a-0018 93.091250 95.611125 so it gives you an idea that
sw3270A-ms98-a-0019 95.611125 101.600750 [silence]
sw3270A-ms98-a-0020 101.600750 104.081750 sure sure so
sw3270A-ms98-a-0021 104.081750 114.167000 [silence]
sw3270A-ms98-a-0022 114.167000 115.585500 uh-huh
sw3270A-ms98-a-0023 115.585500 119.727875 [silence]
sw3270A-ms98-a-0024 119.727875 121.132625 uh-huh
sw3270A-ms98-a-0025 121.132625 126.364250 [silence]
sw3270A-ms98-a-0026 126.364250 128.889750 than we think sure
sw3270A-ms98-a-0027 128.889750 130.513125 sure
sw3270A-ms98-a-0028 130.513125 137.867750 yeah 
sw3270A-ms98-a-0029 137.867750 148.692875 um-hum it sure is the you know as far as i think there was something with the government official that went on conferences for two days and actually
sw3270A-ms98-a-0030 148.692875 159.929625 uh the conferences were nothing but uh you know they're getting paid for this and it was something more than just the conferences they were using it as eating out um when you think about people
sw3270A-ms98-a-0031 159.929625 173.288500 uh taking vacations these big government officials taking descendants in [laughter-congress] the rest of them taking these vacations and using the taxpayers' money for that and it's a real big crunch
sw3270A-ms98-a-0032 173.288500 186.870125 uh of course when they get caught then they're you know they're guilty of course but uh during that time i'm sure there's hundreds of uh thousands of people that are um spending money that does not belong to them
sw3270A-ms98-a-0033 186.870125 191.123125 [silence]
sw3270A-ms98-a-0034 191.123125 192.468000 um-hum

sw3270A-ms98-a-0040 204.181250 206.558625 [noise]
sw3270A-ms98-a-0041 206.558625 211.999250 exactly and i- i don't think uh it's ended up being i mean it gave people jobs
sw3270A-ms98-a-0042 211.999250 225.245000 but i think it also cost um quite a bit as far as because after they're done with the war a lot of things were no longer put to use i mean it was kind of like okay we'll do this during this point and time but after that that's
sw3270A-ms98-a-0043 225.245000 228.709000 you know um they didn't wanna do it anymore
sw3270A-ms98-a-0044 228.709000 233.270750 so a lot of things that they're saying that they're no longer gonna be doing for
sw3270A-ms98-a-0045 233.270750 238.459750 next wars that are coming up that they did for this one in getting rid of a lot of things so
sw3270A-ms98-a-0046 238.459750 243.736500 i don't know [noise] okay well it was good talking to you and have a good evening
