sw3270B-ms98-a-0021 91.455875 96.082000 yeah definitely i think that there's probably a lot of
sw3270B-ms98-a-0022 96.082000 102.413000 waste in defense and in government funded research in the first place
sw3270B-ms98-a-0023 102.413000 104.742375 i mean there was
sw3270B-ms98-a-0024 104.742375 108.856750 um people at Stanford who
sw3270B-ms98-a-0025 108.856750 116.209125 were soaking the government you know using millions of dollars of research money to um
sw3270B-ms98-a-0026 116.209125 120.500125 for the President to buy beach homes or whatever it was
sw3270B-ms98-a-0027 120.500125 126.809750 and i think that that may be more widespread
sw3270B-ms98-a-0028 126.809750 133.006250 than well than we'd like to think but [noise] but then

sw3270B-ms98-a-0039 193.984125 197.268625 problem i mean when you look at
sw3270B-ms98-a-0040 197.268625 202.517750 something like the Gulf War it cost us God knows
sw3270B-ms98-a-0041 202.517750 207.111250 how much you know at a million dollars a pop for Patriot missiles
