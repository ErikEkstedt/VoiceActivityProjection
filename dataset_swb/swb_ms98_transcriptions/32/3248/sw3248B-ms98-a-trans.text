sw3248B-ms98-a-0004 5.301250 9.979750 yeah i remember it it's just like what do i know about the metric [laughter-system]

sw3248B-ms98-a-0010 49.899000 62.155000 i know the whole world has managed to be doing metric system and we're just kind of left out in the middle of nothing and then having to do the conversions that uh the rest of the world doesn't have to do 
sw3248B-ms98-a-0011 62.155000 66.054125 which makes it more difficult in trading and and that type of thing
sw3248B-ms98-a-0012 66.054125 68.993875 as far as going back and forth between the two
sw3248B-ms98-a-0013 68.993875 84.960375 [silence]
sw3248B-ms98-a-0014 84.960375 94.635625 yeah the schools need to do more widespread um you touch it a little here and there and but you're never exp[lained]- really explained to it all and
sw3248B-ms98-a-0015 94.635625 102.025375 and actually even in the science classes though a lot of times um the metric system is used rather than
sw3248B-ms98-a-0016 102.025375 103.029375 um
sw3248B-ms98-a-0017 103.029375 104.937875 the American system
sw3248B-ms98-a-0018 104.937875 106.322750 that we use
sw3248B-ms98-a-0019 106.322750 108.050250 [silence]

sw3248B-ms98-a-0025 169.656625 176.888500 [noise] i think the most logical way is just to educate very severely or very uh
sw3248B-ms98-a-0026 176.888500 190.496625 try very hard in the education system and starting with the young even[tually]- eventually they grow old and they take a while to do it that way but um since it's just right now touched on the education system the more that it's used
sw3248B-ms98-a-0027 190.496625 200.148250 um and it's impressed upon the children the more comfortable they'll feel with it um i don't feel very comfortable with the metric system even though i was exposed to it
sw3248B-ms98-a-0028 200.148250 206.363250 um but if they did ev[en]- so even more than they are now eventually um
sw3248B-ms98-a-0029 206.363250 218.110750 it would [vocalized-noise] gain popularity as they grow older and um they could switch over more easily the more people they have that's trained on the metric system rather than our system

sw3248B-ms98-a-0037 262.318625 274.006375 right but much [laughter-easier] so and i always had a hard time convert[ing]- -[con]verting it's like why can't we just all do it the same what's the purpose of switching back and forth why are we different
