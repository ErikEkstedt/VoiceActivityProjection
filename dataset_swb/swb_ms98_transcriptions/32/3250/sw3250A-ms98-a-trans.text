sw3250A-ms98-a-0028 191.667750 200.477375 i have discovered that you know with my available time i would rather actually read a book than a magazine
sw3250A-ms98-a-0029 200.477375 205.152250 yes and um so but
sw3250A-ms98-a-0030 205.152250 210.288125 [silence]

sw3250A-ms98-a-0035 249.534875 259.552625 you know the Passage of People or something you know and uh but i do like the People magazine it it reminds me of the old time movie magazines when i was young
sw3250A-ms98-a-0036 259.552625 265.278625 and uh [laughter-that's] one and you know i really like that i enjoy that it's quick reading
sw3250A-ms98-a-0037 265.278625 271.248875 you know it doesn't require [laughter-a] [laughter-lot] of thinking and sometimes after i've worked all day and have things to do at night
sw3250A-ms98-a-0038 271.248875 276.788125 i just i want fluff [laughter] i don't want a lot of thinking [laughter]

sw3250A-ms98-a-0040 278.936125 289.555375 it uh you know it's it's much more relaxing sometimes when i read T[ime]- Time magazine after i've read an article i'm real depressed over the situation of the world [laughter]
sw3250A-ms98-a-0041 289.555375 294.034375 so well it seems like we both kind of agree on on the subject of [laughter-magazines]
sw3250A-ms98-a-0042 294.034375 299.522000 and uh so uh i think that probably i will end the call i've enjoyed
