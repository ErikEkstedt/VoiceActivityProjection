sw3241A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.366625 [noise]
sw3241A-ms98-a-0002 0.366625 1.403625 [silence]
sw3241A-ms98-a-0003 1.403625 5.055000 well i still don't trust them_1 i'm sorry [laughter]
sw3241A-ms98-a-0004 5.055000 7.143750 i probably never will
sw3241A-ms98-a-0005 7.143750 8.266125 [laughter]
sw3241A-ms98-a-0006 8.266125 17.733000 [silence]
sw3241A-ms98-a-0007 17.733000 19.302125 uh-huh
sw3241A-ms98-a-0008 19.302125 28.398750 [silence]
sw3241A-ms98-a-0009 28.398750 38.311625 that's right i don't trust maybe i guess it's because of the way what happened over there with their own people how they threw him out of power and
sw3241A-ms98-a-0010 38.311625 45.416875 you know just a big uproar but then you know me and my husband always talk about it because they're running out of money
sw3241A-ms98-a-0011 45.416875 53.930125 you know and what are they going to do when they run out of food are they going to just attack us and take it [laughter] [laughter-it] makes you wonder
sw3241A-ms98-a-0012 53.930125 62.967750 because you know we already we have enough problems over here that we don't need [noise] to be trying to help everybody else which that that gets on my nerves too but
sw3241A-ms98-a-0013 62.967750 73.129000 [silence] 
sw3241A-ms98-a-0014 73.129000 74.566375 yeah
sw3241A-ms98-a-0015 74.566375 87.341125 [silence]
sw3241A-ms98-a-0016 87.341125 101.394250 [noise] yeah but i don't i think they have just as much see bu[t]- i don't know i- i think that they have better like we you know when we go over in Iraq and Iran that's different country but i think see that's why they don't have anything in the Soviet Union they spent more money
sw3241A-ms98-a-0017 101.394250 112.347125 on um what do you call um military power than anything they have more of a expense of military than we do
sw3241A-ms98-a-0018 112.347125 115.381750 [silence]
sw3241A-ms98-a-0019 115.381750 121.172500 well now see that's another problem is they have it in their own thing with all this uh what do you call it uh
sw3241A-ms98-a-0020 121.172500 128.293125 breaking up of the Soviet Union right now i doubt if they had a help of anybody in their country
sw3241A-ms98-a-0021 128.293125 129.908625 they're having so many
sw3241A-ms98-a-0022 129.908625 130.936875 [silence]
sw3241A-ms98-a-0023 130.936875 137.415875 right now [laughter] it's like whoa [laughter] so i don't know if they would have
sw3241A-ms98-a-0024 137.415875 141.953250 you know but it just depends on when
sw3241A-ms98-a-0025 141.953250 148.561375 they do it so i guess it would depend on what what state that they're in
sw3241A-ms98-a-0026 148.561375 153.774375 when they do it but i still wouldn't trust them_1 not i would trust them_1 only so much
sw3241A-ms98-a-0027 153.774375 155.699875 [laughter]
sw3241A-ms98-a-0028 155.699875 163.204250 [silence]
sw3241A-ms98-a-0029 163.204250 164.665375 um-hum
sw3241A-ms98-a-0030 164.665375 170.511375 [silence]
sw3241A-ms98-a-0031 170.511375 172.627750 doing what you supposed to do
sw3241A-ms98-a-0032 172.627750 181.132250 but i think that's what they're trying to do is to get us to do everything you know and them not really do anything because_1 who's checking them
sw3241A-ms98-a-0033 181.132250 184.991625 [silence]
sw3241A-ms98-a-0034 184.991625 193.596875 you know i think that not only if we check them_1 they're not going it's just like coming over here in the United States the government don't tell you everything
sw3241A-ms98-a-0035 193.596875 197.527125 [laughter] they feel they don't have to which i agree
sw3241A-ms98-a-0036 197.527125 202.028125 because_1 if you tell everybody everything everybody in the world would know because they'd put it on TV
sw3241A-ms98-a-0037 202.028125 205.622750 [laughter] and that wouldn't do us any good so
sw3241A-ms98-a-0038 205.622750 211.917625 [silence]
sw3241A-ms98-a-0039 211.917625 214.031750 they're so into TV
sw3241A-ms98-a-0040 214.031750 215.648625 um-hum
sw3241A-ms98-a-0041 215.648625 222.534375 [silence]
sw3241A-ms98-a-0042 222.534375 223.990875 um-hum
sw3241A-ms98-a-0043 223.990875 230.496875 [silence]
sw3241A-ms98-a-0044 230.496875 234.723250 that we really don't that we don't know about
sw3241A-ms98-a-0045 234.723250 238.479125 [silence]
sw3241A-ms98-a-0046 238.479125 243.507625 how much of it is true and how much and how much of it is propaganda
sw3241A-ms98-a-0047 243.507625 247.224500 you know what a[re]- what a[re]- what are we supposed to believe
sw3241A-ms98-a-0048 247.224500 253.391750 but i don't i don't trust the government here more than i trust you know to a point
sw3241A-ms98-a-0049 253.391750 258.372625 but then just like i'm not going to trust another government just because
sw3241A-ms98-a-0050 258.372625 260.391750 [laughter] there's no way
sw3241A-ms98-a-0051 260.391750 262.696875 especially when they've been such a
sw3241A-ms98-a-0052 262.696875 265.014750 [noise] oh
sw3241A-ms98-a-0053 265.014750 273.352000 a power to us you know a force that we have to watch constantly a threat but yet now they're going to be our friends
sw3241A-ms98-a-0054 273.352000 276.952750 no that's like Little Red Riding Hood to me
sw3241A-ms98-a-0055 276.952750 280.618500 [laughter-you] [laughter-know] letting the wolf in and saying oh that's okay
sw3241A-ms98-a-0056 280.618500 281.299625 [laughter]
sw3241A-ms98-a-0057 281.299625 284.355000 we're going to sit here but we're not we're going to watch each other
sw3241A-ms98-a-0058 284.355000 287.391250 and i think whoever wins the the wait
sw3241A-ms98-a-0059 287.391250 288.438500 [silence]
sw3241A-ms98-a-0060 288.438500 290.192375 is probably the one
sw3241A-ms98-a-0061 290.192375 294.344125 [silence]
sw3241A-ms98-a-0062 294.344125 298.244250 yeah as long as i don't care about that they can do whatever they want but
sw3241A-ms98-a-0063 298.244250 299.522000 i don't want it to get t[o]-
