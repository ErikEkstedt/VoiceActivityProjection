sw3255A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 13.497875 [noise] okay for as far as um i would think the probably the uh worst substance that's probably um or started to say the uh what causes the most air pollution is probably the car
sw3255A-ms98-a-0002 13.497875 28.284125 and uh whether or not um they'll ever get into like huge transit systems into big cities where people would all travel on a high speed uh train [laughter] or or something like that or park
sw3255A-ms98-a-0003 28.284125 37.773875 yeah that's exactly it and that's what we're finding um here where we're at in Minneapolis area is that people don't want to carpool that there are
sw3255A-ms98-a-0004 37.773875 49.574500 inconveniences to that or maybe you don't like the person you have to you would want to carpool with that kind of thing so it's it's kind of a thing where uh i think the majority of the people do not carpool

sw3255A-ms98-a-0013 74.677750 76.218500 yes
sw3255A-ms98-a-0014 76.218500 77.857125 um-hum

sw3255A-ms98-a-0018 88.259375 102.628625 yes yeah that's very true um other than that uh i don't know oh okay [laughter-oh] [laughter-okay] we'll try to be real quick here the other thing then is because i don't know how long they want us to talk it
sw3255A-ms98-a-0019 102.628625 107.063000 five minutes oh okay Minneapolis area
sw3255A-ms98-a-0020 107.063000 121.039125 uh actually no we have uh quite a bit uh the only problem that we have and that's all over the whole world is ozone and of course hay fever season you get more pollutants such as those but those are natural
sw3255A-ms98-a-0021 121.039125 132.265000 um but there is starting to in Minneapolis itself because of so many people on the highway there is becoming a problem of pollution and they just put in a strict
sw3255A-ms98-a-0022 132.265000 142.495750 law that as of every year when you get your license tabs you have to have your car inspected to see if it's releasing any uh lead
sw3255A-ms98-a-0023 142.495750 149.808750 into the air the air or other pollutants and if that's the case then you have to get your car fixed at least you can't

sw3255A-ms98-a-0049 214.817875 227.140250 sure uh the other thing when you're talking about freon with cars uh air conditioning i'm sure over there it's it's a necessity versus something up here we can live without it but it's uncomfortable
sw3255A-ms98-a-0050 227.140250 236.844500 but uh this year my husband recharged our freon because it was needed to be done and one of the cans [laughter-released] entire amount of freon into the uh 
sw3255A-ms98-a-0051 236.844500 247.728500 into the air because he opened it and i don't know if there was something wrong with it or it his directions weren't quite fully instructed onto that and i was thinking how many other people
sw3255A-ms98-a-0052 247.728500 260.156375 oh sure because if you take it into a service station they want to charge you forty dollars just for uh freon which only costs you about three dollars so i have this feeling that freon probably will increase in price
sw3255A-ms98-a-0053 260.156375 268.978250 because it is something that people will have to take into consideration and say hey that's that's right there i think it's like three or four dollars a a can
sw3255A-ms98-a-0054 268.978250 281.156250 and it takes about four to five cans to fill up a air conditioning unit in a car and i- i thought about that and my husband even was kind of woozy after that because i'm sure he [laughter-breathed] [laughter-it]
sw3255A-ms98-a-0055 281.156250 287.690875 [laughter] but uh you think about that all the people that are using freon and things like that and
