sw3255B-ms98-a-0005 25.514125 29.579625 yeah it'll be hard to get people to give up their mobility

sw3255B-ms98-a-0009 48.919500 57.344000 i think so too i'm in Texas and very few people carpool uh the people that i know don't want to because uh
sw3255B-ms98-a-0010 57.344000 66.127875 they never know for sure what time they're going to leave their job they never know when they want to run out and do an errand at noon you know they just feel they need their car

sw3255B-ms98-a-0014 70.591500 81.843500 um-hum that's right and people don't want to give it up but now i think we've made great strides in changing a lot of that by going to the unleaded gasoline and and [noise]
sw3255B-ms98-a-0015 81.843500 92.286750 to change the car itself but uh you know i- i don't guess we can get away from it a hundred percent but yeah
sw3255B-ms98-a-0016 92.286750 99.543125 well my other line is ringing but we're going to ignore it [laughter] i'm sorry for these beeps

sw3255B-ms98-a-0018 101.278000 108.616375 oh a close to five minutes i believe and you're in Minneapolis well is the pollution really bad up there

sw3255B-ms98-a-0035 147.714250 153.843750 that's the way it has gotten here we have just had that law i think about a year maybe a year and a half here in Texas
sw3255B-ms98-a-0036 153.843750 165.905375 but uh i think it's a good idea because a lot of people still want to drive the older cars which you can't blame them_1 for that and uh but if they are polluting the air they need do need to have them fixed
sw3255B-ms98-a-0037 165.905375 178.813500 and you know there's a big move especially in the industrial part in Texas right now of controlling the CFCs that the big manufacturing companies are producing into the air they're having to change the type of products they use
sw3255B-ms98-a-0038 178.813500 183.601625 uh they can't use like i have a friend that's in the air conditioning heating business
sw3255B-ms98-a-0039 183.601625 192.413875 and they have to pay a penalty for every ounce or pound of this certain type of Freon that they use in the air conditioning sys[tems]- systems
sw3255B-ms98-a-0040 192.413875 201.846875 therefore the individual every time they have a service call if they have an old unit that's still using this twenty two Freon or whatever it is it costs them three times as much to get it fixed
sw3255B-ms98-a-0041 201.846875 211.520250 and uh if you have a new high efficiency system that uses the new type of Freons that do not release as many CFCs into the atmosphere it doesn't cost as much
sw3255B-ms98-a-0042 211.520250 216.718750 so eventually people are gonna have to go to newer systems you know but

sw3255B-ms98-a-0065 286.500750 298.530000 yeah well of course in the uh i'd think you probably noticed in the discount stores and places in the hair sprays we're not seeing as many aerosol cans down here nearly everything is in the pump squirt y[ou]-
