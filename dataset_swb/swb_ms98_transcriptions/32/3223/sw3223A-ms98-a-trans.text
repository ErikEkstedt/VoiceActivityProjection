sw3223A-ms98-a-0032 125.927875 135.798875 you know Richie always used to be so you know just so honest and pure i guess and when he left the show you know that it seemed to be missing that part of it and i never did like it after that
sw3223A-ms98-a-0033 135.798875 144.846375 so i- i don't know i- i say see the same thing in like Wonder Years and a lot of the shows that i like to watch there always seems to be that kind of value in there somewhere

sw3223A-ms98-a-0051 213.927125 214.975875 [noise]
sw3223A-ms98-a-0052 214.975875 218.352625 yeah one one year then maybe they'll make it i don't know
sw3223A-ms98-a-0053 218.352625 223.009375 so [noise] but uh yeah i'd like sports programming quite a bit but
sw3223A-ms98-a-0054 223.009375 232.111375 uh i guess my my favorite shows are the and you know the getting back to a point that you made that's really true we are watching Roseanne i guess couple of weeks ago and
sw3223A-ms98-a-0055 232.111375 239.939250 her daughter was talking about birth control you know and my daughter was kind of walking in during that time and [laughter] you know she's only seven years old so
sw3223A-ms98-a-0056 239.939250 244.763500 [silence]
sw3223A-ms98-a-0057 244.763500 246.068875 yeah
sw3223A-ms98-a-0058 246.068875 249.388250 [silence]

sw3223A-ms98-a-0061 252.809375 256.826000 [silence]
sw3223A-ms98-a-0062 256.826000 262.143250 yeah well that that seems to be more our values too like like the Wonder Years i- i mean
sw3223A-ms98-a-0063 262.143250 271.322000 uh it's kind of risque stuff for maybe for teenagers you know or an[d]- and you can kind of relate to it you know i don't know that's i enjoy that a lot
sw3223A-ms98-a-0064 271.322000 276.713500 but uh you know i- i- i agree with you the and it's funny because the shows 
sw3223A-ms98-a-0065 276.713500 285.892250 like a lot of them_1 that used to be considered risque like Three's Company and stuff i think they they maintained people would watch them_1 because there was that uh
sw3223A-ms98-a-0066 285.892250 291.916250 you know there was really the period that was going on there i mean he really wasn't messing around with the girls but everybody perceived him that way and stuff
sw3223A-ms98-a-0067 291.916250 295.427250 but as soon as you know he went to move in with another girl the show just died
sw3223A-ms98-a-0068 295.427250 299.554000 and it's it's interesting th[at]- that a lot of the shows are that way
