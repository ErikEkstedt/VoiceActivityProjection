sw3207A-ms98-a-0004 27.875750 29.359000 uh-huh
sw3207A-ms98-a-0005 29.359000 44.662125 [silence]
sw3207A-ms98-a-0006 44.662125 54.224500 and it ta[kes]- it takes a lot of care like twenty four hours a day someone has to be we[ll]- like there's someone in my my fiance's family his grandmother too and they're
sw3207A-ms98-a-0007 54.224500 56.721000 that hi[s]- her
sw3207A-ms98-a-0008 56.721000 68.292125 son his uncle whatever you know anyway [noise] h[e]- he has he recently retired and so he's the one who she moved in with when she had a stroke and and all the other children
sw3207A-ms98-a-0009 68.292125 78.292750 um are working or whatever they're all my parent's age and uh so he's got you know his retirement though is really twenty four hours a day they have a
sw3207A-ms98-a-0010 78.292750 85.388500 day care [noise] two days a week they call it senior citizen day [laughter-care] but she goes to the senior citizen center
sw3207A-ms98-a-0011 85.388500 91.016250 so sh[e]- he gets a break two days a week but it's only for like two or three hours at a time
sw3207A-ms98-a-0012 91.016250 101.028250 and you know just you see a lot of things like you you know was always a great golfer and wanted to play golf when he retired and you know that a lot of the things he thought he would do when he retired he's not able to do now
sw3207A-ms98-a-0013 101.028250 104.270500 [noise] but he refuses to consider any other
sw3207A-ms98-a-0014 104.270500 108.692500 i- i don't know yeah and is that how your parents feel or
sw3207A-ms98-a-0015 108.692500 111.879250 [silence]
sw3207A-ms98-a-0016 111.879250 113.193750 uh-huh
sw3207A-ms98-a-0017 113.193750 130.175250 [silence]
sw3207A-ms98-a-0018 130.175250 131.486250 uh-huh
sw3207A-ms98-a-0019 131.486250 142.199500 [silence]
sw3207A-ms98-a-0020 142.199500 152.532375 i know at this i know i feel like i would never do that with my parents either you know but i- i really feel bad for the people i see th[at]- not very i'm not really really experienced but like i said just have that one
sw3207A-ms98-a-0021 152.532375 159.497125 family and that's really so bad for the guy who his whole life is different now and than he thought it would be but
sw3207A-ms98-a-0022 159.497125 171.419375 yeah and he's got you know seven brothers and sisters and and uh he's the one because he's the one that doesn't going to work everyday and that she moved in with when she needed to move in with someone and
sw3207A-ms98-a-0023 171.419375 175.720250 [silence]
sw3207A-ms98-a-0024 175.720250 179.466875 i can't say much oh well that's great that's a good idea we ought to
sw3207A-ms98-a-0025 179.466875 186.668250 yeah and maybe when the other brothers and sisters retire [laughter-or] [laughter-whatever] i don't know what they're gonna do it's really not my family it's my fiance's so i don't
sw3207A-ms98-a-0026 186.668250 194.254125 i can't say much but i always feel like i would never put my parents in either and i wonder i'm gonna be the only
sw3207A-ms98-a-0027 194.254125 204.632375 sibling that isn't gonna have children so if my parents do need to live with someone it'll probably be with me because all my brothers and sisters will be having teenagers around and everything to care for
sw3207A-ms98-a-0028 204.632375 216.523750 you know and i'm i that's fine with me [vocalized-noise] my fiancee i both figure that's what's we're gonna end up with both of the parents or whoever if it you know what i mean we feel like it's our responsibility and i feel like i would never put them_1 in a home
sw3207A-ms98-a-0029 216.523750 223.713000 but i wonder how much you know if one of us is gonna have to quit work someday or retire early or something you think about it and
sw3207A-ms98-a-0030 223.713000 230.698000 it's really i don't know this country kind of takes the worst care of the elderly of any other country and
sw3207A-ms98-a-0031 230.698000 235.778500 [silence]
sw3207A-ms98-a-0032 235.778500 239.784375 it's really more of a um like a respect issue
sw3207A-ms98-a-0033 239.784375 252.308125 a[nd]- that the older the older people in other countries that i've been to seem to really have a lot more respect for the elderly people and and they really seen as wise and and in this country nobody really
sw3207A-ms98-a-0034 252.308125 260.510125 yeah nobody really pays attention and they oh the old timer made with the old way and nobody respects the traditions and you know it's
sw3207A-ms98-a-0035 260.510125 270.814875 i- i'm not saying that i do either but [laughter] you know it's just funny and and we really don't have any they don't have social security and everything really isn't that much for
sw3207A-ms98-a-0036 270.814875 283.536875 elderly people to live on you know even if they're in good health it's incredible they don't have any they don't get special treatment and maybe they should you know because_1 we're all gonna get old someday
sw3207A-ms98-a-0037 283.536875 288.653250 so it's a [vocalized-noise] it's kind of depressing [laughter-topic] [laughter-though] how old are you
sw3207A-ms98-a-0038 288.653250 295.169875 so it is yeah and it must be rough for you too to see your grandmother [vocalized-noise]
sw3207A-ms98-a-0039 295.169875 299.234000 [silence]
