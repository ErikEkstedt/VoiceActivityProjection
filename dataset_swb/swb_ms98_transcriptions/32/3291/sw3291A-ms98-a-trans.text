sw3291A-ms98-a-0012 119.966500 124.721250 the crooks and what have you are going to get weapons if the weapons are available
sw3291A-ms98-a-0013 124.721250 133.107875 i think the biggest problem we have in this country is there are just entirely too many weapons available and the types of the weapons i mean there is no

sw3291A-ms98-a-0017 142.490375 153.197375 cutting into my civil liberties and all this no i- i- i take a different stand that as long as they are available and they are so readily accessed out there then somebody is taken away from my civil liberties
sw3291A-ms98-a-0018 153.197375 155.175750 and uh
sw3291A-ms98-a-0019 155.175750 168.797875 maybe i'm a little bit strong when i said total gun -[con]tro[l]- control that's that's really not what i meant by i mean we need control we've got to be able to get a handle on what is happening and we've got to reduce the number of weapons that are out in the in the in the public
