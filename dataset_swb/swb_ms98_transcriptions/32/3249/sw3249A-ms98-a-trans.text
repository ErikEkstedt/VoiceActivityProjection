sw3249A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 2.985750 [noise] okay um do you have children of your own
sw3249A-ms98-a-0002 2.985750 5.906125 oh you do what ages are they
sw3249A-ms98-a-0003 5.906125 12.511750 [silence]
sw3249A-ms98-a-0004 12.511750 15.463125 oh my y[ou]- sound like a busy parent
sw3249A-ms98-a-0005 15.463125 21.015375 i have two a seven year old and three and a half [noise] mine are both girls
sw3249A-ms98-a-0006 21.015375 22.912500 yeah
sw3249A-ms98-a-0007 22.912500 24.908250 [silence]
sw3249A-ms98-a-0008 24.908250 27.746750 oh do you and your wife both work
sw3249A-ms98-a-0009 27.746750 29.316250 [silence]
sw3249A-ms98-a-0010 29.316250 31.901500 well that's nice i
sw3249A-ms98-a-0011 31.901500 45.677125 i stay home too [laughter] yeah to me that's the ideal situation but i did work part-time when i had just one child and uh i'm pretty picky about my criteria of child care i
sw3249A-ms98-a-0012 45.677125 52.058375 i don't care too much for day care centers and preschool well you know schools where the children stay all day long
sw3249A-ms98-a-0013 52.058375 62.502750 and so i- i think the thing that i would think was most important is is if they're getting that individual attention that they need from an adult and i don't think they get enough of it [laughter]
sw3249A-ms98-a-0014 62.502750 65.808875 [silence]
sw3249A-ms98-a-0015 65.808875 76.228500 [noise] yeah mine's pretty low too uh the lady that i left my daughter with only kept only had two other children besides my daughter so three to one i felt comfortable with
sw3249A-ms98-a-0016 76.228500 81.748500 i think if it got much more than that i would start feeling like someone was gonna be left out
sw3249A-ms98-a-0017 81.748500 84.498250 [silence]
sw3249A-ms98-a-0018 84.498250 85.949000 yeah
sw3249A-ms98-a-0019 85.949000 88.091625 [silence]
sw3249A-ms98-a-0020 88.091625 98.224625 right i don't thin[k]- well i think once my uh child got to be maybe four years old i might feel a little better about a larger group setting
sw3249A-ms98-a-0021 98.224625 106.987500 but up until that time both of my girls had such passive personalities that if they had been around a whole lot of other children i really think they would have been
sw3249A-ms98-a-0022 106.987500 115.914750 you know taken for granted [laughter] some of the other kids would have pushed them_1 around and um [noise] probably taken advantage of them a little bit what do you think
sw3249A-ms98-a-0023 115.914750 129.477375 [silence]
sw3249A-ms98-a-0024 129.477375 131.400375 yeah
sw3249A-ms98-a-0025 131.400375 133.258000 no
sw3249A-ms98-a-0026 133.258000 134.400375 [silence]
sw3249A-ms98-a-0027 134.400375 136.204750 no
sw3249A-ms98-a-0028 136.204750 145.624750 oh i didn't even hear one no it might have been i have call waiting but if so i'll just try later [laughter] that's fine
sw3249A-ms98-a-0029 145.624750 147.949000 [silence]
sw3249A-ms98-a-0030 147.949000 154.521250 yeah you said that uh you would like if your wife had to go back to work you probably would prefer that they stayed in a home
sw3249A-ms98-a-0031 154.521250 163.732875 [silence]
sw3249A-ms98-a-0032 163.732875 165.672875 oh yeah
sw3249A-ms98-a-0033 165.672875 169.718500 [silence]
sw3249A-ms98-a-0034 169.718500 171.351500 yeah
sw3249A-ms98-a-0035 171.351500 174.110500 [silence]
sw3249A-ms98-a-0036 174.110500 175.466000 yeah
sw3249A-ms98-a-0037 175.466000 176.805875 [silence]
sw3249A-ms98-a-0038 176.805875 178.183125 right
sw3249A-ms98-a-0039 178.183125 182.760625 [silence]
sw3249A-ms98-a-0040 182.760625 191.059875 [noise] yeah i don't know see i feel real sorry for couples where both people are you know have to work to make ends meet because you're kind of
sw3249A-ms98-a-0041 191.059875 199.467250 you know stuck [laughter-there] i- i know that um [noise] if i had to go to work right now i would really have a hard time finding someone 
sw3249A-ms98-a-0042 199.467250 211.240125 because i babysitters are just really hard to come by an[d]- especially real good ones and you know ones that uh don't keep that many children and give them_1 the individual attention that i think they need and that kind of thing
sw3249A-ms98-a-0043 211.240125 216.278875 so i would really be hard pressed to find something that i felt like was quality child care [noise]
sw3249A-ms98-a-0044 216.278875 222.971500 so i don't know i feel real sorry for you know working moms that are really looking hard and trying to do a good job with their kids
sw3249A-ms98-a-0045 222.971500 228.154000 i'm just thankful i'm able to stay home [laughter] it makes the choice a lot easier
sw3249A-ms98-a-0046 228.154000 230.532500 [silence]
sw3249A-ms98-a-0047 230.532500 233.420875 wow that's great
sw3249A-ms98-a-0048 233.420875 235.815875 oh i know
sw3249A-ms98-a-0049 235.815875 237.547875 yeah
sw3249A-ms98-a-0050 237.547875 238.734125 [silence]
sw3249A-ms98-a-0051 238.734125 247.573375 yeah oh yeah we feel that way i mean even now it's really hard to make ends meet even with two children so i can imagine with four
sw3249A-ms98-a-0052 247.573375 255.478500 but you learn how to to stretch money [laughter] how to use hand-me-downs and that kind of thing really makes a big difference too
sw3249A-ms98-a-0053 255.478500 267.809500 but i don't know i uh i worked at a little preschool it was a private one you know like a church sponsored type thing where it was only two days a week Tuesday and Thursday from like nine till two
sw3249A-ms98-a-0054 267.809500 273.965750 and even that i was not totally satisfied with the way the kids were treated uh
sw3249A-ms98-a-0055 273.965750 275.906250 uh-huh
sw3249A-ms98-a-0056 275.906250 282.013250 [silence]
sw3249A-ms98-a-0057 282.013250 283.571875 yeah
