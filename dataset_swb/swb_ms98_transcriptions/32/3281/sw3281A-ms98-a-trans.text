sw3281A-ms98-a-0002 3.816375 10.904875 do you uh do most of your cooking at home or do you uh have a lot of people come in and have to prepare for them
sw3281A-ms98-a-0003 10.904875 17.312625 [silence]
sw3281A-ms98-a-0004 17.312625 30.024250 ah my goodness [laughter] well what would you uh like to cook what's what what what is your favorite uh recipes uh that you would like to have for a dinner party n[ow]- you're in Dallas is it
sw3281A-ms98-a-0005 30.024250 31.415000 okay
sw3281A-ms98-a-0006 31.415000 37.434750 [silence]
sw3281A-ms98-a-0007 37.434750 42.156125 i was i was thinking in terms of Mexican almost Tex[-Mex]- Tex-Mex
sw3281A-ms98-a-0008 42.156125 44.315000 [silence]
sw3281A-ms98-a-0009 44.315000 45.672125 um-hum
sw3281A-ms98-a-0010 45.672125 50.237250 [silence]
sw3281A-ms98-a-0011 50.237250 57.919875 well that's a very interesting food though and when i go out to eat dinner sometimes that's the type of foods i like to find we have uh
sw3281A-ms98-a-0012 57.919875 67.562250 i think [vocalized-noise] Chico's or or these different restaurants in this area that uh have all those fine Mexican foods but um if i were to cook uh a dinner party
sw3281A-ms98-a-0013 67.562250 73.758625 uh it may be standard to you but uh actually i never get too much fried chicken
sw3281A-ms98-a-0014 73.758625 81.353125 but i would have fried chicken um [noise] with reasonably hot sauce on it almost a Mexican type thing
sw3281A-ms98-a-0015 81.353125 86.342875 and i love twice cooked potatoes have you ever had twice cooked potatoes
sw3281A-ms98-a-0016 86.342875 93.602125 with with the cream made of the the sour cream and cream cheese and uh little oleo and i use uh
sw3281A-ms98-a-0017 93.602125 96.859375 oregano and maybe dill weed on mixed in with it
sw3281A-ms98-a-0018 96.859375 100.555250 and uh i like broccoli casseroles
sw3281A-ms98-a-0019 100.555250 109.540625 which would include onion and cheese and again more dill weed and some medium hot peppers as you can see i'm inclined towards the [laughter-Mexican] [laughter-type] of a meal
sw3281A-ms98-a-0020 109.540625 116.460375 [laughter] and i would probably have some quiet and gentle fried onion rings mixed in there with it too
sw3281A-ms98-a-0021 116.460375 119.962250 so [noise] uh how would you improve upon that
sw3281A-ms98-a-0022 119.962250 126.236750 [silence]
sw3281A-ms98-a-0023 126.236750 129.390000 [noise] more fresh vegetables included to that
sw3281A-ms98-a-0024 129.390000 130.858250 [silence]
sw3281A-ms98-a-0025 130.858250 132.565250 uh-huh
sw3281A-ms98-a-0026 132.565250 135.196625 how do you cook your green beans
sw3281A-ms98-a-0027 135.196625 136.539750 um-hum
sw3281A-ms98-a-0028 136.539750 139.547875 [silence]
sw3281A-ms98-a-0029 139.547875 140.914000 [noise]
sw3281A-ms98-a-0030 140.914000 144.154000 [silence]
sw3281A-ms98-a-0031 144.154000 145.998750 so you [vocalized-noise]
sw3281A-ms98-a-0032 145.998750 152.021125 all -[r]ight that's what i was wondering about what what you use and and and [vocalized-noise] herbs and so forth
sw3281A-ms98-a-0033 152.021125 157.094625 [silence]
sw3281A-ms98-a-0034 157.094625 158.457875 um-hum
sw3281A-ms98-a-0035 158.457875 159.839000 [silence]
sw3281A-ms98-a-0036 159.839000 163.977375 have you ever tried Chinese type green beans
sw3281A-ms98-a-0037 163.977375 166.544875 we use soy sauce
sw3281A-ms98-a-0038 166.544875 168.503375 [silence]
sw3281A-ms98-a-0039 168.503375 181.171125 well you might uh be interested in that have it gives a very delicious taste you you have a soy sauce taste and you also have a little cream sauce in there because you you would use the water and um
sw3281A-ms98-a-0040 181.171125 185.274625 [noise] golly what's this white powder that that uh
sw3281A-ms98-a-0041 185.274625 190.187875 that you mix with water and gives a thick sauce and i can't even think of the name of that right at the moment
sw3281A-ms98-a-0042 190.187875 193.962625 [silence]
sw3281A-ms98-a-0043 193.962625 203.848875 [laughter-anyhow] sorry about my mind but uh it does make a nice thick creamy sauce with the green beans and then you have the nice soy sauce taste under it
sw3281A-ms98-a-0044 203.848875 211.597125 with a few onions in there with it it does it it brings out such a so much different things in uh in the string beans
sw3281A-ms98-a-0045 211.597125 215.884000 i l[ike]- i like it to try them_1 differently i hardly ever cook them the same way twice
sw3281A-ms98-a-0046 215.884000 217.826500 just so i can enjoy them_1
sw3281A-ms98-a-0047 217.826500 220.704500 so you might uh think about that Ch[inese]- 
sw3281A-ms98-a-0048 220.704500 226.624625 Chinese cooking actually has a lot of very delicious tastes to them
sw3281A-ms98-a-0049 226.624625 232.707375 and uh north African cooking is good when you use something called couscous
sw3281A-ms98-a-0050 232.707375 237.756125 and that's uh made from uh semolina i think they call it beans
sw3281A-ms98-a-0051 237.756125 242.469250 and that's the type of something that whatever you mix with it this couscous
sw3281A-ms98-a-0052 242.469250 251.843750 uh absorbs the taste of whatever else you put in it with it makes a very delicious dish you p[robably]- probably have to buy that from specialty stores [noise]
sw3281A-ms98-a-0053 251.843750 259.981250 C O U S C O U S and that's a a north African dish they eat it one to two meals every day in North Africa 
sw3281A-ms98-a-0054 259.981250 265.562125 and it is very very flexible you can do a lot of things with it makes a fantastic uh
sw3281A-ms98-a-0055 265.562125 267.400125 uh salad
sw3281A-ms98-a-0056 267.400125 272.994500 with cucumbers and olive oil and onions and oh boy real tasty
sw3281A-ms98-a-0057 272.994500 278.009500 [noise] well i've enjoyed talking with you and i hope i've given you some ideas and uh
