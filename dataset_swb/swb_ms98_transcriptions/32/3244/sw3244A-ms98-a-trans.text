sw3244A-ms98-a-0004 10.706875 17.525750 and uh in the small town we don't but uh we're not that far from the city where there's tons of pollu[tion]- 
sw3244A-ms98-a-0005 17.525750 21.064000 okay i'll go ahead and start recording that [vocalized-noise]
sw3244A-ms98-a-0006 21.064000 22.420500 [noise]
sw3244A-ms98-a-0007 22.420500 36.431000 okay um just in particular here in the Twin Cities we have a lot of big corporations and um i'm sure there's a lot of pollution we uh before moving to Wisconsin lived across from where they were um
sw3244A-ms98-a-0008 36.431000 48.560250 gravel pits and also where they were making tar and so we would occasionally if the wind was blowing the right direction would get the smell of tar and
sw3244A-ms98-a-0009 48.560250 59.458125 it would uh smell the continuous you knew that you were also breathing that into your lungs so and it was like miles away but just the idea of having that
sw3244A-ms98-a-0010 59.458125 71.261125 come across the way it did in the wind kind of made you know that there was a lot of pollution and that was just one small corporation that was doing the pollution of that but
sw3244A-ms98-a-0011 71.261125 80.410625 also um where we also lived too it was very close to a highway so we got a lot of fumes from uh trucks
sw3244A-ms98-a-0012 80.410625 90.424250 and cars and you would literally see the pollution on your furniture i mean it was on your tables you would dust every day and it was dirty um
sw3244A-ms98-a-0013 90.424250 95.293875 type of uh dust i mean it wasn't the typical dust that you get way out in the country
sw3244A-ms98-a-0014 95.293875 96.053875 um
sw3244A-ms98-a-0015 96.053875 108.991375 [vocalized-noise] i live in a small um town now quite a ways from the Twin Cities about an hour away and i may dust once a week and that's all it needs versus every day when i lived in the city
sw3244A-ms98-a-0016 108.991375 110.019125 so
sw3244A-ms98-a-0017 110.019125 111.828250 [silence]
sw3244A-ms98-a-0018 111.828250 117.034375 oh yeah it it comes right on through through the screens the only way that you could
sw3244A-ms98-a-0019 117.034375 128.910625 actually live in the in the city is to close your windows and have an air cleaner system right in your home that would take the air from the outside and clean the air before it would get into the house
sw3244A-ms98-a-0020 128.910625 138.557625 and so it was quite a dirty city um i[f]- if you were well protected by trees which catch a lot of the pollution
sw3244A-ms98-a-0021 138.557625 146.353375 then you're fine but most of the time in the city you have lots of high rises you have lots of other things that are not
sw3244A-ms98-a-0022 146.353375 153.996750 catching the pollution and it's just going for miles and miles and miles and it's landing somewhere with the wind but
sw3244A-ms98-a-0023 153.996750 161.121000 [silence]

sw3244A-ms98-a-0033 185.264500 190.179250 oh sure sure yeah it's i mean our air quality um
sw3244A-ms98-a-0034 190.179250 194.302625 in the Twin Cities is a lot better than what we've heard about California and maybe in
sw3244A-ms98-a-0035 194.302625 206.682750 the other areas but um they were always talking about the air quality of today is this you know the ozone or whatever and it's kind of scary because th[e]- air is something we take for granted
sw3244A-ms98-a-0036 206.682750 214.778500 and many people are too busy getting to work not thinking about okay i could have carpooled with a friend even
sw3244A-ms98-a-0037 214.778500 227.450500 my husband was uh talking to some of the guys at work now he's uh fifteen miles away from work but he was talking wouldn't it be nice to carpool and the guy says well it's too close it wouldn't pay and so
sw3244A-ms98-a-0038 227.450500 229.264500 yeah and
sw3244A-ms98-a-0039 229.264500 237.528125 ex[actly]- exactly and so my husband says well that's fine you know it would save quite a bit on the wear and tear on cars and you know the gas
sw3244A-ms98-a-0040 237.528125 243.517375 and no everybody has their preference to drive by themselves or if they do they
sw3244A-ms98-a-0041 243.517375 255.578625 they drive with one little buddy uh at least it's with one person but most of the time people are saying forget it i don't want to carpool it's too much of a hassle it's too much involvement but yet
sw3244A-ms98-a-0042 255.578625 262.257125 yes we are and i think of my daughter and i'm sure you think of your children and you kind of say to yourself
sw3244A-ms98-a-0043 262.257125 272.297250 what kind of future will they have when they think back and say well my parents did have the choice to kind of make a difference and [noise] i think people are trying
sw3244A-ms98-a-0044 272.297250 274.992625 but they have to change attitudes
