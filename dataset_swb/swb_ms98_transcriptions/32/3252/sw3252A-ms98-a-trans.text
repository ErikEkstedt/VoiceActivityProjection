sw3252A-ms98-a-0034 205.590125 217.995000 and i saw these little Springer Spaniels and so i decided well you know this would really be a nice dog to have so when i got back home to Carney Nebraska
sw3252A-ms98-a-0035 217.995000 231.003625 i told my wife about it and i said you know this is just a i- i can just hear the dog crying for me now [laughter] and and Christmas is coming up you know hint hint and so

sw3252A-ms98-a-0037 241.255625 247.596250 we uh got to Omaha and i decided i'd take my friend over and show him the dog and
sw3252A-ms98-a-0038 247.596250 260.965500 so i got over there and she said oh that's too bad the dog has already been sold and i didn't realize it but this guy had somehow worked it out so that he got there a little bit earlier bought the dog and she was in the back room
sw3252A-ms98-a-0039 260.965500 269.540875 and uh so that night we had a reception for some of the uh potential high school students or college students and
sw3252A-ms98-a-0040 269.540875 277.997875 and uh he had the dog the whole time in his room and and i had no idea and so we headed back to Carney that night and
sw3252A-ms98-a-0041 277.997875 288.393125 the dog rode in the car and we stopped along the way and had a bite to eat and they left the dog in the car and i guess while we were inside eating
