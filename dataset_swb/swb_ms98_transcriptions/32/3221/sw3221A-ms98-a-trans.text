sw3221A-ms98-a-0002 0.926250 4.879250 [silence]
sw3221A-ms98-a-0003 4.879250 8.319875 yes we are we are talking about computers this morning
sw3221A-ms98-a-0004 8.319875 14.190250 [silence]
sw3221A-ms98-a-0005 14.190250 21.860250 [laughter-you] [laughter-have] you have four machines around you boy well you've uh you've got me beat i have a a Zenith here
sw3221A-ms98-a-0006 21.860250 24.482125 and at home i have a Commodore
sw3221A-ms98-a-0007 24.482125 29.085125 and a Zenith and my wife has an AT&T 1200 i believe it is
sw3221A-ms98-a-0008 29.085125 30.619500 [silence]
sw3221A-ms98-a-0009 30.619500 40.205375 [noise] well actually on my Commodore i [vocalized-noise] mainly study lottery numbers would you believe i have written some uh programs in basic 
sw3221A-ms98-a-0010 40.205375 49.017000 whereby i can select any number of uh drawings and from that extract the numbers that have appeared the most
sw3221A-ms98-a-0011 49.017000 55.806500 i have another program in which i can look at the cyclical uh appearance of these numbers
sw3221A-ms98-a-0012 55.806500 58.722375 to see if there's anything that's consistent on that
sw3221A-ms98-a-0013 58.722375 63.112250 [noise] i have another number that allows me another program that allows me to
sw3221A-ms98-a-0014 63.112250 70.516125 add all the numbers i want and then it generates a complete set of numbers so that all combinations are covered
sw3221A-ms98-a-0015 70.516125 74.805375 [noise] so this is what i do most of the time uh
sw3221A-ms98-a-0016 74.805375 75.867500 [silence]
sw3221A-ms98-a-0017 75.867500 81.465750 on my Commodore on my Commodore um-hum [noise] and of course i have uh
sw3221A-ms98-a-0018 81.465750 91.436000 word processors and i write all my letters is is wonderful uh my uh thoughts in my head come in bursts of about a paragraph at a time and i get them_1 all down and
sw3221A-ms98-a-0019 91.436000 97.983500 naturally on a computer if you make a mistake who cares you can go back and uh [laughter-correct] [laughter-it] very easily
sw3221A-ms98-a-0020 97.983500 103.461250 so that makes it very very nice i get all my thoughts down and go back and [laughter-clean] [laughter-it] [laughter-up] very very readily
sw3221A-ms98-a-0021 103.461250 105.351625 [noise] so how about you Charles
sw3221A-ms98-a-0022 105.351625 116.390625 [silence]
sw3221A-ms98-a-0023 116.390625 117.630750 um-hum
sw3221A-ms98-a-0024 117.630750 122.600125 [silence]
sw3221A-ms98-a-0025 122.600125 123.992375 uh-huh
sw3221A-ms98-a-0026 123.992375 133.407250 [silence]
sw3221A-ms98-a-0027 133.407250 134.475875 yeah
sw3221A-ms98-a-0028 134.475875 135.544625 [silence]
sw3221A-ms98-a-0029 135.544625 138.065125 so wh[ere]- where may i ask where you work sir
sw3221A-ms98-a-0030 138.065125 139.093500 [silence]
sw3221A-ms98-a-0031 139.093500 142.607500 i know you work for the government i just wondering are you a NAVC or what
sw3221A-ms98-a-0032 142.607500 145.002250 what what section of it roughly
sw3221A-ms98-a-0033 145.002250 147.359250 [silence]
sw3221A-ms98-a-0034 147.359250 154.671625 oh uh-huh because_1 see that's my type of work too i work at the Applied Research Lab here here on campus and
sw3221A-ms98-a-0035 154.671625 162.183875 my my field is underwater acoustics and there's a lot of things we can do with computers into uh studying
sw3221A-ms98-a-0036 162.183875 163.379125 how
sw3221A-ms98-a-0037 163.379125 174.590625 uh things vary in the water you know and uh taking advantage of them_1 and so forth so it's a very nice very nice field and i- i am retiring at the end of this month end of December excuse me
sw3221A-ms98-a-0038 174.590625 176.843500 [silence]
sw3221A-ms98-a-0039 176.843500 178.052625 yes
sw3221A-ms98-a-0040 178.052625 183.016500 i'm a p[rofessor]- i'm an associate professor but my i my i'm a full time researcher
sw3221A-ms98-a-0041 183.016500 184.121625 [silence]
sw3221A-ms98-a-0042 184.121625 187.888625 and it's uh been a very very interesting career believe me
sw3221A-ms98-a-0043 187.888625 189.541250 [laughter]
sw3221A-ms98-a-0044 189.541250 191.355625 [silence]
sw3221A-ms98-a-0045 191.355625 192.625500 w[ell]-
sw3221A-ms98-a-0046 192.625500 194.892500 well uh
sw3221A-ms98-a-0047 194.892500 204.637625 the ones here in the laboratory obviously i'm they're gonna stay but i have similar machines at home i would consider uh uh doing some more consulting when i get home
sw3221A-ms98-a-0048 204.637625 213.835750 but i have a very very busy extra life anyway i'm also a musician and i play in several symphony orchestras and uh i run a concert band and
sw3221A-ms98-a-0049 213.835750 217.722875 so i have a lot of external uh interests
sw3221A-ms98-a-0050 217.722875 231.062625 but i do want to get very deeply much more deeply into computer work because obviously the world is gonna be controlled run and operated by computers in the future there's no doubt about it because it is really taking over
sw3221A-ms98-a-0051 231.062625 243.469000 and the amount of work that we're doing and the depth of things that we are studying can basically only be handled by computers because uh it's so much [laughter-involved]
sw3221A-ms98-a-0052 243.469000 252.043375 and it sounds as though you're probably more aware of that than i am because uh i don't get to use it in my daily work as much as i would like to
sw3221A-ms98-a-0053 252.043375 253.130000 [silence]
sw3221A-ms98-a-0054 253.130000 261.539500 here again let's say i'm starting to getting ready in preparation for retirement and uh so basically what i'm doing is
sw3221A-ms98-a-0055 261.539500 268.777250 slowly getting rid of my things for many many years i had a full size acoustics uh
sw3221A-ms98-a-0056 268.777250 280.162500 study laboratory where where i could take recordings and and uh perform experiments with them_1 and so forth and so that's gone now and so i'm sort of out of business
sw3221A-ms98-a-0057 280.162500 288.475250 uh as i say i worked with NAVC fellow named Steve Blazey was the fellow i worked with for many many years and he is now retired
sw3221A-ms98-a-0058 288.475250 289.524500 [silence]
sw3221A-ms98-a-0059 289.524500 293.844250 so it's been an interesting life and computers have come in towards the
sw3221A-ms98-a-0060 293.844250 299.074000 latter end of that i wish we'd had computers in the very beginning it would have been
