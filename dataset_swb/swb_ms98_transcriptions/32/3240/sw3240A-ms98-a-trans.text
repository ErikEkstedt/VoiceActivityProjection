sw3240A-ms98-a-0043 234.552875 238.778500 but we just have a we we in the past we've had Great Danes

sw3240A-ms98-a-0046 258.456250 266.495750 and she would totally ignore this baby i mean the dog could be laying there sleeping and somebody could carry this child into the room and the dog would just kind of
sw3240A-ms98-a-0047 266.495750 276.590000 sniff and wa[lk]- walk out of the room [laughter] and would have absolutely nothing to do with the baby until uh she got old enough to sit in the high chair and throw food over
sw3240A-ms98-a-0048 276.590000 288.282125 yet and then all of a sudden the dog decided she was okay but [laughter-yeah] but then [laughter] my husband decided it wou[ld]- might be nice to have a lap dog for a change
sw3240A-ms98-a-0049 288.282125 295.467125 now he just really likes having a dog that curls up in his lap when he watches TV and sits in his recliner and falls asleep
