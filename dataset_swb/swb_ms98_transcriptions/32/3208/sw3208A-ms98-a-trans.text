sw3208A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 8.495500 okay well basically i [noise] am a mother of a three year old so i c[an]- kind of relate to trying to find a good day care because it's uh
sw3208A-ms98-a-0002 8.495500 21.391250 extremely hard thing to do to trust somebody else with your child uh trust their emotional and their safety and all the rest of that and uh i've been pretty selective and what i'm finding is with um
sw3208A-ms98-a-0003 21.391250 33.075250 day cares that are like day care centers like [noise] for instance uh Learning Tree or KinderCare and all of that what i find is that they're highly structured highly organized
sw3208A-ms98-a-0004 33.075250 38.415000 almost too rigid for the children if you bring a child in at a certain time
sw3208A-ms98-a-0005 38.415000 49.570250 uh like nap time or whatever time uh because of parents' hours they are differ and when i bring my daughter into a such a system like that uh
sw3208A-ms98-a-0006 49.570250 61.162250 they only have one thing going on that's nap time everybody's napping whether they came there an hour before or they came a[t]- right during that time and with that kind of a system my daughter [noise]
sw3208A-ms98-a-0007 61.162250 73.364750 just isn't likely to enjoy it if she has to good there immediately and lay down on a cot so um home day care has been an option and i've looked into that the only thing is you raise the question of [noise]
sw3208A-ms98-a-0008 73.364750 77.286875 is it safe uh can you trust the people you know um
sw3208A-ms98-a-0009 77.286875 84.390500 [silence]
sw3208A-ms98-a-0010 84.390500 96.846875 sure oh sure sure that's really scary and to the point that you kind of say to yourself especially_1 home day care i mean i think center day cares there's so many people coming in and out
sw3208A-ms98-a-0011 96.846875 108.292125 that you're better off if you're going to put a child into that type of system for eight hours it's fine it depends on the age of the child now some children do real well that are at the age of
sw3208A-ms98-a-0012 108.292125 116.968000 four or five or children that have been in that kind of system for a while but home tea[ching]- home day care works well if it's an infant if it's 
sw3208A-ms98-a-0013 116.968000 126.704875 if it's if you wanna have kind of like a family structuring where there's a home that they can [noise] be provided because_1 i've seen things at the day care where they can't keep up with all the kids the kids have [noise]
sw3208A-ms98-a-0014 126.704875 129.122000 colds and they're sick all the time and the
