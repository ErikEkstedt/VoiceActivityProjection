sw3277B-ms98-a-0002 1.760250 14.021375 [noise] well that's a good question we just got in from looking at cars and we've probably been looking at them_1 for a couple [laughter-months] and we haven't bought one yet [laughter] so that almost answers the question how about_1 you
sw3277B-ms98-a-0003 14.021375 15.035375 [silence]

sw3277B-ms98-a-0010 36.677750 48.615750 [silence]
sw3277B-ms98-a-0011 48.615750 58.799625 well we we've been looking at [vocalized-noise] just about everything i guess because we really don't need a car we just sort of [laughter] want the luxury of buying a new car and um
sw3277B-ms98-a-0012 58.799625 64.741625 i don't know we were today we were looking at Lexuses and we keep going back to Cadillacs
sw3277B-ms98-a-0013 64.741625 77.993250 and looking at those and then you don't know if you wanna spend thirty thousand dollars and buy a new car or whether you wanna buy uh like a ninety one Cadillac a ninety or ninety one for you know twenty or nineteen or fifteen you can get them
sw3277B-ms98-a-0014 77.993250 86.631125 fairly cheap compared to buying a brand new one [noise] and the new Lexus that that they have that you you pay sticker price for those
sw3277B-ms98-a-0015 86.631125 88.712500 [silence]
sw3277B-ms98-a-0016 88.712500 96.173125 yes yes we we were [laughter] we were all in them_1 today but you know when it comes to oops
sw3277B-ms98-a-0017 96.173125 104.528500 you know do you wanna spend about thirty thousand dollars and uh it'd probably be a little over that with the tax [noise] so that's that's really where
sw3277B-ms98-a-0018 104.528500 116.925125 where we are or should we just buy you know a little [laughter-Volkswagen] we've [laughter-right] we've you know the one of those Cabriolets i guess they're called uh it's a convertible it's sort of like you know square in the back
sw3277B-ms98-a-0019 116.925125 129.299625 [noise] but the the selling point i guess that that i or it has to pass my test i'm i'm short and i need to sit in the seat see if i can get the seat high enough to see over the steering wheel like i like to see
sw3277B-ms98-a-0020 129.299625 131.334375 yeah i'm [vocalized-noise] about_1 five two

sw3277B-ms98-a-0022 132.663125 139.435250 [noise] and to make sure the seat belt doesn't hit me in the neck that it comes really over the shoulder and not up around your neck so
sw3277B-ms98-a-0023 139.435250 147.373500 right well it can be comfortable but those things not all the seat belts are gonna work that way nor can i get all the seats up high enough
sw3277B-ms98-a-0024 147.373500 153.307125 to do that so uh so on those we just we just forget about [laughter]

sw3277B-ms98-a-0026 158.000250 168.999375 [noise] i don't know this is a new experience for us j[ust]- just mainly because my uh my mother had died which meant that we were coming into some money that we could
sw3277B-ms98-a-0027 168.999375 178.045250 splurge and buy a car [laughter-but] but yet it's difficult to do though when you're not used to it so that's [laughter-why] we're we're out uh
