sw3261A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.818375 [noise] -[o]kay
sw3261A-ms98-a-0002 0.818375 14.504875 um i don't know if you wanna start first okay basically um we're not in the city we're out in the country and uh we were living in the city and i think uh crime has escalated quite a bit just from the
sw3261A-ms98-a-0003 14.504875 23.013750 uh short time we were in the city their crime and murders alone this is in uh [vocalized-noise] city of Minneapolis and that's
sw3261A-ms98-a-0004 23.013750 29.069250 quite a ways from uh you know uh other cities like New York and uh Detroit and all of that but
sw3261A-ms98-a-0005 29.069250 42.681000 just in particular crime has escalated quite a bit in murders i mean with guns and teenagers not so much um with people that are in their later twenties or thirties or whatever it's basically people that are um
sw3261A-ms98-a-0006 42.681000 56.333625 sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen nineteen years old killing each other um and there's like one a day so that kind of gets to the point that you uh from the years before it wasn't quite as much so
sw3261A-ms98-a-0007 56.333625 58.208250 uh-huh
sw3261A-ms98-a-0008 58.208250 61.149375 [silence]
sw3261A-ms98-a-0009 61.149375 63.672000 uh-huh uh-huh
sw3261A-ms98-a-0010 63.672000 67.420875 [silence]
sw3261A-ms98-a-0011 67.420875 69.176125 oh wow
sw3261A-ms98-a-0012 69.176125 70.448625 [silence]
sw3261A-ms98-a-0013 70.448625 82.692250 yeah oh definitely for you guys sure and like i said in Minneapolis it was basically uh one a day every night you were hearing about a murder whether it was uh between gang related murders or
sw3261A-ms98-a-0014 82.692250 97.228125 [noise] uh somebody in the wrong spot at the wrong time that kind of thing and uh teenagers killing each other or random shootings just basically shooting a gun into somebody's house as they drive by or shooting somebody on the street just because they didn't even know them_1
sw3261A-ms98-a-0015 97.228125 110.868250 but i think what's happening is um at least in Minneapolis um the i think that people are getting fed up with it and just this morning was uh reading uh or watching a TV program on women carrying guns
sw3261A-ms98-a-0016 110.868250 121.744125 to protect themselves against um crime and i'm all for it i mean when it comes to if somebody's gonna do crime against me they're going to uh you know
sw3261A-ms98-a-0017 121.744125 124.175125 [vocalized-noise] if if i have a gun i'll shoot them_1
sw3261A-ms98-a-0018 124.175125 133.420000 i won't even think twice about it just simply because [vocalized-noise] my safety comes first and that person that's uh doing something against me would uh get shot but
sw3261A-ms98-a-0019 133.420000 140.549500 i'm an old country girl that a long time ago learned how to shoot a gun and i'm not afraid of a gun and i gue[ss]-
sw3261A-ms98-a-0020 140.549500 141.632375 [silence]
sw3261A-ms98-a-0021 141.632375 150.046375 yeah it's hard like with uh in our home we have a gun in the home but i don't go out and carry it around with me in my purse but
sw3261A-ms98-a-0022 150.046375 161.993375 it comes down to i think a lot of New York women do from what i've been hearing is that New York and uh other cities that have such a high crime rate in the subways and that are starting to carry guns so
sw3261A-ms98-a-0023 161.993375 167.871125 [silence]
sw3261A-ms98-a-0024 167.871125 169.354625 sure
sw3261A-ms98-a-0025 169.354625 170.614125 [silence]
sw3261A-ms98-a-0026 170.614125 172.612250 uh-huh sure
sw3261A-ms98-a-0027 172.612250 173.645125 [silence]
sw3261A-ms98-a-0028 173.645125 186.715000 well he did it out of a pure vengeance and i think he murdered just purely because of his but if you're um up against a gang of boys or teenagers
sw3261A-ms98-a-0029 186.715000 188.400375 yeah
sw3261A-ms98-a-0030 188.400375 197.067500 right exactly if he had shot them and uh shot them or wounded them or even shot just basically
sw3261A-ms98-a-0031 197.067500 210.759750 straight clear on onto their face or whatever if he felt that he was uh [vocalized-noise] that much of a victim i think uh the court system would've looked at it a little bit differently but he bluntly just shot them even after they were [vocalized-noise] i think down on the ground
sw3261A-ms98-a-0032 210.759750 217.117750 not moving uh or whatever but uh i think there's a justification of where people say
sw3261A-ms98-a-0033 217.117750 227.769500 uh most of the people are fed up with crime so when you're gonna get juries you're gonna get juries of people saying well you know this guy asked for it or this person asked for it or whatever
sw3261A-ms98-a-0034 227.769500 235.592000 and i think you're gonna find less and less juries uh saying well the the the victim should be put on trial for it um
sw3261A-ms98-a-0035 235.592000 244.257000 uh when there's a crime being produced you've got people like Jeff [Dollmeyer/Dahmer] [laughter-that] [laughter-was] bringing people into his apartment and killing them uh
sw3261A-ms98-a-0036 244.257000 258.138125 no no that was in uh Wisconsin that was in Milwaukee area yeah so you know you've got things like that if maybe those guys would have carried a gun they could have shot him right then and there before [laughter-he] the guy um
sw3261A-ms98-a-0037 258.138125 270.371000 got them but i[t's]- it's just the idea that i think people are more aware of crime so i don't know i think people i don't know what's gonna happen in the future either people are going to be going back to the old west and carrying a guns
sw3261A-ms98-a-0038 270.371000 284.234500 slinged [laughter-you] [laughter-kn[ow]-] on their hip or hidden or whatever but uh unless something happens maybe laws change maybe some of these people that have had two or three crimes against them never released from prison um
sw3261A-ms98-a-0039 284.234500 288.213000 then you've got to pay for them_1 in prison though so i don't know
sw3261A-ms98-a-0040 288.213000 294.376375 [silence]
sw3261A-ms98-a-0041 294.376375 295.900000 uh-huh
sw3261A-ms98-a-0042 295.900000 297.415625 uh-huh
sw3261A-ms98-a-0043 297.415625 298.530000 uh-huh
