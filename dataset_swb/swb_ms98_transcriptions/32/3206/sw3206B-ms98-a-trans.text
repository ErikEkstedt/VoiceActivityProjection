sw3206B-ms98-a-0003 1.990750 5.028875 [silence]
sw3206B-ms98-a-0004 5.028875 10.053625 uh yes it's about why there aren't more people that are voting and participating in
sw3206B-ms98-a-0005 10.053625 14.547000 [silence]
sw3206B-ms98-a-0006 14.547000 16.481000 [noise] oh absolutely
sw3206B-ms98-a-0007 16.481000 17.489125 [silence]
sw3206B-ms98-a-0008 17.489125 20.615625 um i think that uh
sw3206B-ms98-a-0009 20.615625 31.487125 it's kind of discouraging to um i have been involved in some political campaigns and that kind of thing and it's really discouraging to be in a phone bank and call people and not
sw3206B-ms98-a-0010 31.487125 35.566875 a lot of them_1 are so ill informed they have no idea
sw3206B-ms98-a-0011 35.566875 38.656500 you know even th[ere's]- there's an election or
sw3206B-ms98-a-0012 38.656500 41.673250 and these are people that are registered
sw3206B-ms98-a-0013 41.673250 65.579375 [silence]
sw3206B-ms98-a-0014 65.579375 67.594500 well that's a thought
sw3206B-ms98-a-0015 67.594500 75.925250 [silence]
sw3206B-ms98-a-0016 75.925250 80.693250 hm [noise] i don't know i- i like that idea um
sw3206B-ms98-a-0017 80.693250 81.698250 [silence]
sw3206B-ms98-a-0018 81.698250 87.363750 [noise] oh i had a though just a second ago but it slipped my mind um
sw3206B-ms98-a-0019 87.363750 88.372750 [silence]
sw3206B-ms98-a-0020 88.372750 95.487000 one thing that i- that i think probably one of the reasons that people don't vote more is because they don't know the candidates
sw3206B-ms98-a-0021 95.487000 106.774250 and i think sometimes you know that's one thing that i have learned in w[orking]- working in elections and things is you know sometimes even when you work for someone you don't really know what they're like
sw3206B-ms98-a-0022 106.774250 113.454750 i know there's been a couple of people that we voted for and worked for and when they got in office it was just a disaster [laughter]
sw3206B-ms98-a-0023 113.454750 121.539750 uh and and i'm not sure how you go about really finding out what people are really like before you vote for them_1
sw3206B-ms98-a-0024 121.539750 127.909750 [silence]
sw3206B-ms98-a-0025 127.909750 130.042750 absolutely
sw3206B-ms98-a-0026 130.042750 147.990000 [silence]
sw3206B-ms98-a-0027 147.990000 149.774875 that's right
sw3206B-ms98-a-0028 149.774875 167.785625 [silence]
sw3206B-ms98-a-0029 167.785625 171.521625 now if you just lose if you just skip one election
sw3206B-ms98-a-0030 171.521625 173.153875 three
sw3206B-ms98-a-0031 173.153875 174.601625 [silence]

sw3206B-ms98-a-0033 175.937000 184.515875 [silence]
sw3206B-ms98-a-0034 184.515875 188.961250 i think that's an excellent idea because then people really have to think about it
sw3206B-ms98-a-0035 188.961250 200.343375 [silence]
sw3206B-ms98-a-0036 200.343375 204.490000 no excuse i- i'm not sure if i'm familiar with that or not
sw3206B-ms98-a-0037 204.490000 211.760875 [silence]
sw3206B-ms98-a-0038 211.760875 213.174625 um-hum
sw3206B-ms98-a-0039 213.174625 220.680500 [silence]
sw3206B-ms98-a-0040 220.680500 223.441875 oh i think that's great uh
sw3206B-ms98-a-0041 223.441875 233.898625 [vocalized-noise] actually you know my husband has run for office before and sometimes it's nice to be able to go ahead of time and vote because you know if you're gonna be tied up that day
sw3206B-ms98-a-0042 233.898625 242.845625 uh campaigning or whatever it might be um that kind of just kind of takes that load off you know you can just go ahead and get that taken care of and
sw3206B-ms98-a-0043 242.845625 246.776125 [silence]

sw3206B-ms98-a-0047 259.674250 281.066250 [silence]
sw3206B-ms98-a-0048 281.066250 283.904875 well hopefully once they have uh
sw3206B-ms98-a-0049 283.904875 288.974125 you know once they've checked them off the list they they do have to check them_1 off a list
sw3206B-ms98-a-0050 288.974125 291.952750 when they vote so hopefully they couldn't
