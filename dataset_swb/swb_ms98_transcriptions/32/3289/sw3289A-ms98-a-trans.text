sw3289A-ms98-a-0015 74.059250 76.640000 reimbursed by anyone
sw3289A-ms98-a-0016 76.640000 83.187500 okay uh yeah that that's interesting point i i i'm not an enthusiast for juries particularly
sw3289A-ms98-a-0017 83.187500 92.600250 and i think especially in in civil cases i doubt doubt the effectiveness of it i hadn't thought about it from terms of the cost point of view to providing the jury
sw3289A-ms98-a-0018 92.600250 93.894750 i think
sw3289A-ms98-a-0019 93.894750 99.923000 we may be the only major country today that still uses juries in civil trials

sw3289A-ms98-a-0021 106.012125 111.260500 [noise] i'm pretty sure Britain has has uh given up juries in civil cases [noise]

sw3289A-ms98-a-0025 122.753000 127.146875 would be the people you [vocalized-noise] decision about_1 whether to use juries or deci[sion]-

sw3289A-ms98-a-0027 129.171375 131.462000 i mean i i i think
sw3289A-ms98-a-0028 131.462000 136.738500 it would be better to have them have judges trained professionals deciding such things
sw3289A-ms98-a-0029 136.738500 141.852250 um i don't know there's any Constitu[tional]- way to do that other than to change the Constitution

sw3289A-ms98-a-0038 187.715250 191.482000 no i don't th[ink]- i guess different states have different rules on that

sw3289A-ms98-a-0043 221.385000 231.887250 this is be[cause]- because of [vocalized-noise] not who initially comes in but who's selected out of the panel uh okay certainly both sides
sw3289A-ms98-a-0044 231.887250 232.889875 [silence]
sw3289A-ms98-a-0045 232.889875 235.618750 pick criteria by which
sw3289A-ms98-a-0046 235.618750 241.384500 they wanna wanna judge juries and and uh veto lots of those and i suspect
sw3289A-ms98-a-0047 241.384500 246.865250 that uh well see [vocalized-noise] likely to get off that way although it it'll vary
sw3289A-ms98-a-0048 246.865250 248.513375 um
sw3289A-ms98-a-0049 248.513375 255.879875 i mean i guess traditionally juries are supposed to do findings of fact as opposed to findings of law
sw3289A-ms98-a-0050 255.879875 258.197375 and deciding
sw3289A-ms98-a-0051 258.197375 261.451375 [silence]
sw3289A-ms98-a-0052 261.451375 266.022750 well that that varies by state and locality as to whether the

sw3289A-ms98-a-0054 268.005250 270.826000 [noise] uh there is a little basis for comparison

sw3289A-ms98-a-0056 294.964750 298.690000 well i guess i feel much more comfortable with with judges eith[er]-
