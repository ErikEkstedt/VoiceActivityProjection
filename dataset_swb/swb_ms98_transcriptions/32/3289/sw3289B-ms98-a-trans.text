sw3289B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.366125 i'm ready okay
sw3289B-ms98-a-0002 1.366125 2.488375 [noise] 
sw3289B-ms98-a-0003 2.488375 12.620250 well you know when to me when you're talking about juries there's there's two types of juries you've got the civil juries and then you've got the criminal juries now the criminal juries
sw3289B-ms98-a-0004 12.620250 23.967375 my understanding of those where a person has done some crime and you're trying to determine that they need to go to jail or not and then if he does for how long the civil jury does it matter of 
sw3289B-ms98-a-0005 23.967375 35.646125 you owe me some money or you think that i owe you some money and we can't get it resolved so we go to the jury and we're ask we're gonna ask that jury to uh make a decision as to who owes who and for how much
sw3289B-ms98-a-0006 35.646125 38.759375 i'm sorry i have a problem with that
sw3289B-ms98-a-0007 38.759375 52.153625 because first of all [noise] i'm a working person and i need to get paid for my day of work and if the our juries only pay us seven dollars and fifty cents for a full day of work
sw3289B-ms98-a-0008 52.153625 63.404750 i think it's wrong that two people have a dispute they had a little car wreck and maybe one owes the other guy five hundred dollars or a thousand dollars whatnot and they're going to call me away from work 
sw3289B-ms98-a-0009 63.404750 72.424500 for seven dollars and fifty cents to make a decision as to who owes who and how much to me that is what we pay our judges to do
sw3289B-ms98-a-0010 72.424500 75.145750 i am self-employed that's right
sw3289B-ms98-a-0011 75.145750 77.575125 i'm not going to be reimbursed by no one 
sw3289B-ms98-a-0012 77.575125 100.144250 [silence]
sw3289B-ms98-a-0013 100.144250 105.727125 you know that one i've never heard of but that you may be right i was [laughter-i] [laughter-wish] [laughter-i'd] you know i've i've never heard that before 
sw3289B-ms98-a-0014 105.727125 110.665500 [silence]
sw3289B-ms98-a-0015 110.665500 120.041125 but i mean i[sn't]- isn't that what we have the elected officials who supposedly is unbiased who can't aren't they supposed to have a head on their shoulders to make these decisions 
sw3289B-ms98-a-0016 120.041125 125.915750 [silence]
sw3289B-ms98-a-0017 125.915750 129.706500 no decision as to whether or not as far as civil's concerned
sw3289B-ms98-a-0018 129.706500 135.997500 [silence]
sw3289B-ms98-a-0019 135.997500 137.171875 true
sw3289B-ms98-a-0020 137.171875 141.307250 [silence]
sw3289B-ms98-a-0021 141.307250 151.811875 [noise] you're probably right but it that's still my as far as i'm concerned i just think it's wrong to use a jury for the civil matters now you can talk about_1 criminal matters 
sw3289B-ms98-a-0022 151.811875 157.643500 uh i've got no problem with that one because you know here you're talking about uh
sw3289B-ms98-a-0023 157.643500 162.238125 has a person fit into society has he followed the rules of society
sw3289B-ms98-a-0024 162.238125 166.926250 i've i've got no problem at all with using your peers quote quote 
sw3289B-ms98-a-0025 166.926250 177.142625 and helping to make decisions although we'd have problems as to who qualifies to be on that uh jury and i think some of the the 
sw3289B-ms98-a-0026 177.142625 186.873500 [laughter] manipulative rules that they use to say that all the rich and famous cannot be on a jury but all the poor dregs can be you know it d[oesn't]- it doesn't make sense 
sw3289B-ms98-a-0027 186.873500 191.098875 [silence]
sw3289B-ms98-a-0028 191.098875 196.275875 well it i[t]- it wha[t]- amount to if you're if you're rich if you got money 
sw3289B-ms98-a-0029 196.275875 204.134375 and your really high on society somehow another you're going come up with a one of these excuse that the the the judge gonna say yeah you're excused you don't have to be here 
sw3289B-ms98-a-0030 204.134375 214.667875 but if you are some poor old uh blue collar worker who you know uh just trying to eke out a living and uh i work from eight to five and
sw3289B-ms98-a-0031 214.667875 217.985125 you know for some reason he's not gonna find an excuse to get out 
sw3289B-ms98-a-0032 217.985125 223.855750 and so we typically find our juries made up of some of the dumbest people rather than the smarter people 
sw3289B-ms98-a-0033 223.855750 226.789500 [silence]
sw3289B-ms98-a-0034 226.789500 228.150250 right
sw3289B-ms98-a-0035 228.150250 237.068625 [silence]
sw3289B-ms98-a-0036 237.068625 238.406125 [noise]
sw3289B-ms98-a-0037 238.406125 246.563250 [silence]
sw3289B-ms98-a-0038 246.563250 247.774125 true
sw3289B-ms98-a-0039 247.774125 256.702875 [silence]
sw3289B-ms98-a-0040 256.702875 262.288750 but then they but then they also have to make the decision as to how long that person should serve
sw3289B-ms98-a-0041 262.288750 263.851875 [silence]
sw3289B-ms98-a-0042 263.851875 268.411125 okay and and there most juries don't even know what the hell they even talking about 
sw3289B-ms98-a-0043 268.411125 270.898875 [silence]
sw3289B-ms98-a-0044 270.898875 277.673625 and then when you get someone who says okay this person should be convicted for thirty years two years later they're on probation
sw3289B-ms98-a-0045 277.673625 287.602750 because the jury doesn't know and in in the state of Texas i don't think you are allowed uh the jury's not allowed to be told how soon that person would be off on probation 
sw3289B-ms98-a-0046 287.602750 291.645500 only thing that they can do is determine how long they should be put in jail
sw3289B-ms98-a-0047 291.645500 295.101875 not knowing what the rest of the rule is which i think is unfair
sw3289B-ms98-a-0048 295.101875 298.690000 [silence]
