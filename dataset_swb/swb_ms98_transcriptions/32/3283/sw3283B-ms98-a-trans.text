sw3283B-ms98-a-0002 0.580000 2.056625 [silence]
sw3283B-ms98-a-0003 2.056625 3.996250 right
sw3283B-ms98-a-0004 3.996250 7.874125 i am very much for capital punishment
sw3283B-ms98-a-0005 7.874125 9.242750 [silence]
sw3283B-ms98-a-0006 9.242750 17.278375 my dad retired from the federal prison of bureaus and i've been raised around
sw3283B-ms98-a-0007 17.278375 19.144250 prison
sw3283B-ms98-a-0008 19.144250 33.214500 prisons all my life and i believe if you don't have a punishment befitting the crime there's not any deterrent [laughter]
sw3283B-ms98-a-0009 33.214500 35.184500 that's right
sw3283B-ms98-a-0010 35.184500 46.815375 [silence]
sw3283B-ms98-a-0011 46.815375 49.623000 especially not a federal prison
sw3283B-ms98-a-0012 49.623000 71.534250 [silence]
sw3283B-ms98-a-0013 71.534250 79.005500 well see we were under uh the state prisons were under a mandate to
sw3283B-ms98-a-0014 79.005500 90.039250 uh it was over crowded and the federal came in and said hey you know you have either got to build more prisons or let people go
sw3283B-ms98-a-0015 90.039250 91.078000 [silence]
sw3283B-ms98-a-0016 91.078000 103.599250 and finally our governor at the time which who is not in office now came in and said okay where we draw the line is no sex offenders will be let
sw3283B-ms98-a-0017 103.599250 113.077375 loose under early bail you know or early uh [vocalized-noise] out but uh we have
sw3283B-ms98-a-0018 113.077375 116.961375 the death penalty is not given often
sw3283B-ms98-a-0019 116.961375 120.578125 but there have been [vocalized-noise]
sw3283B-ms98-a-0020 120.578125 124.953000 and you know i maybe it should be
sw3283B-ms98-a-0021 124.953000 126.895250 uh
sw3283B-ms98-a-0022 126.895250 128.570250 [silence]
sw3283B-ms98-a-0023 128.570250 137.469125 well it should be given you know i i won't say sparingly but i do believe it should be befitting the crime
sw3283B-ms98-a-0024 137.469125 156.010625 [silence]
sw3283B-ms98-a-0025 156.010625 161.820875 right course you know they're they're entitled to a speedy trial
sw3283B-ms98-a-0026 161.820875 174.907375 but then they're they're also entitled to drag it through the courts for years and years and years on appeals so somehow you know it doesn't really balance out too much
sw3283B-ms98-a-0027 174.907375 177.681625 [silence]
sw3283B-ms98-a-0028 177.681625 187.612625 and it seems even though you know that they got the prisoner himself can come to the point that hey i'm tired i just want out
sw3283B-ms98-a-0029 187.612625 193.264875 you know i'm tired of fighting it then the system just keeps on
sw3283B-ms98-a-0030 193.264875 200.829750 and at that point you know i- i really think there needs to be maybe a shorter
sw3283B-ms98-a-0031 200.829750 203.208250 appeal process
sw3283B-ms98-a-0032 203.208250 209.029875 [silence]
sw3283B-ms98-a-0033 209.029875 213.248500 well part of that is the overcrowding of the court system
sw3283B-ms98-a-0034 213.248500 227.527500 [silence]
sw3283B-ms98-a-0035 227.527500 237.760625 uh it doesn't it doesn't help them_1 any at all and course your court system when you get into the appeals
sw3283B-ms98-a-0036 237.760625 242.622000 i don't believe criminal is in a court by itself
sw3283B-ms98-a-0037 242.622000 250.558625 and the whole judicial system is backed up with a lot of junk that shouldn't be in there
sw3283B-ms98-a-0038 250.558625 255.862500 [silence]
sw3283B-ms98-a-0039 255.862500 262.218750 we've gotten into a very litigious uh type of life
sw3283B-ms98-a-0040 262.218750 269.386375 [silence]
sw3283B-ms98-a-0041 269.386375 272.657875 well i just [laughter]
sw3283B-ms98-a-0042 272.657875 275.864375 i just feel like their
sw3283B-ms98-a-0043 275.864375 278.684625 crime and punishment and
sw3283B-ms98-a-0044 278.684625 282.662375 if if you don't have the punishment
sw3283B-ms98-a-0045 282.662375 289.963875 you double your crime and th[at]- you know that is just personal feeling it's not going on facts
sw3283B-ms98-a-0046 289.963875 293.951125 i think the facts would probably back it up but
sw3283B-ms98-a-0047 293.951125 295.437875 what
sw3283B-ms98-a-0048 295.437875 298.214625 [silence]
sw3283B-ms98-a-0049 298.214625 299.618000 well yes i
