sw3235B-ms98-a-0003 4.993000 12.951750 that's a tough question we're now able to work full eight hours a day and still do our housework right 
sw3235B-ms98-a-0004 12.951750 17.898250 [laughter] don't ask me [laughter]
sw3235B-ms98-a-0005 17.898250 30.343000 [silence]

sw3235B-ms98-a-0007 33.904250 42.957750 [silence]
sw3235B-ms98-a-0008 42.957750 48.826625 well i'm a school teacher and i'm in charge of raising them so i can appreciate it

sw3235B-ms98-a-0013 66.927875 74.337125 well you know it's interesting because_1 when i heard the topic i was thinking uh this summer Oprah had a TV show
sw3235B-ms98-a-0014 74.337125 79.731250 about wives that refused to go to work and how their husbands thought they were terrible
sw3235B-ms98-a-0015 79.731250 82.886625 and one woman had four children
sw3235B-ms98-a-0016 82.886625 90.301000 and her husband said she wasn't pulling her own weight in the family and that's frightening
sw3235B-ms98-a-0017 90.301000 96.854875 and it's you know it was almost from the audience participation it was almost a
sw3235B-ms98-a-0018 96.854875 99.032125 social issue
sw3235B-ms98-a-0019 99.032125 105.783125 yeah people were siding with the husband saying you've got to go to work if you have these four children you've got to support them_1
sw3235B-ms98-a-0020 105.783125 109.710625 and nobody would give her credit for being home and raising them
sw3235B-ms98-a-0021 109.710625 116.917625 [silence]

sw3235B-ms98-a-0045 232.890500 240.493125 what the girl said in class and you know what's right because there's no mother at home to do it
sw3235B-ms98-a-0046 240.493125 242.602000 and um
sw3235B-ms98-a-0047 242.602000 247.236125 it makes a difference i've and just the social values
sw3235B-ms98-a-0048 247.236125 254.001625 [silence]

sw3235B-ms98-a-0055 279.564500 286.959750 and then when you know they go on one salary will they be able to sustain what their lifestyle is
sw3235B-ms98-a-0056 286.959750 293.213500 and they back to work and you know i agree with you i was raised in a generation we didn't need all those things
