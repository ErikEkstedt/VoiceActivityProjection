sw3225A-ms98-a-0019 72.577375 77.737625 we i end up with an old standby that we call Russian chicken because it's so easy
sw3225A-ms98-a-0020 77.737625 84.473750 and uh it goe[s]- you have to cook very little to go with it just some rice and some salad and that's about it you know
sw3225A-ms98-a-0021 84.473750 85.526375 [silence]
sw3225A-ms98-a-0022 85.526375 93.056500 uh you make you just take your boneless chicken breasts and then you take and make a a dressing out of uh Russian dressing one bottle of that
sw3225A-ms98-a-0023 93.056500 95.568875 and a package of Lipton Onion Soup mix
sw3225A-ms98-a-0024 95.568875 98.126625 and three ounces of apricot preserves
sw3225A-ms98-a-0025 98.126625 104.977500 and you mix it up and you just put it on the top of the chicken and then i cover the pan with foil and put it in the oven for about an hour
sw3225A-ms98-a-0026 104.977500 107.761625 and then i take the foil off and let it brown
sw3225A-ms98-a-0027 107.761625 109.994500 takes about another twenty minutes
sw3225A-ms98-a-0028 109.994500 112.077750 and it's delicious
sw3225A-ms98-a-0029 112.077750 121.424750 and it's so simple because i can pop it in when i come in the door you know and then uh go about my business and by the time i've got everything else ready the chicken's rea[dy]- chicken's done
