sw3225B-ms98-a-0043 142.622000 147.348000 and um you know every month they've got all different kinds of recipes but
sw3225B-ms98-a-0044 147.348000 159.912125 [noise] i got one in there about a year or so ago on cheesecake and it's just a regular cheesecake and then you can put raspberry um topping on it but inside the cheesecake uh recipe you put um
sw3225B-ms98-a-0045 159.912125 162.362500 lemon peel and orange peel
sw3225B-ms98-a-0046 162.362500 171.974125 and it's just enough to taste it you know when when when you're eating the cheesecake and it is wonderful but it takes a long time because you have to cook it for
sw3225B-ms98-a-0047 171.974125 180.449875 forty five minutes and then you turn the oven off and you leave it in the oven for another forty five minutes and then you open up the oven door and leave it in for another forty [laughter-five] [laughter-minutes] 
sw3225B-ms98-a-0048 180.449875 185.997625 and then you're supposed to um i think chill it to room temperature
sw3225B-ms98-a-0049 185.997625 192.557750 so sometimes i'll do that overnight and then put the topping on the next day but it's it's very good
