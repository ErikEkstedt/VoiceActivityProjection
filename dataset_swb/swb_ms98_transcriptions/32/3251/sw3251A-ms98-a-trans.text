sw3251A-ms98-a-0025 139.175250 150.640000 but we're still fighting bugs and ready to change some of the the summer flowers out i still have caladiums that are pretty which is a surprise this late in the year
sw3251A-ms98-a-0026 150.640000 152.064125 uh-huh
sw3251A-ms98-a-0027 152.064125 156.006625 but like today it's eighty five degrees it's really strange

sw3251A-ms98-a-0029 158.005500 164.547625 but that'll change real quick [laughter] then we'll wished we'd planted bulbs and pansies already

sw3251A-ms98-a-0033 170.449625 177.170625 well Texas has gotten to where it's a real problem as far as plants because our summers are so terribly hot
sw3251A-ms98-a-0034 177.170625 191.745500 and we have ice storms every year and there just aren't that many plants and shrubs that can take both of those extremes some of the things that used to be hardy are getting to where they don't make it through the two swings
sw3251A-ms98-a-0035 191.745500 194.896375 [silence]

sw3251A-ms98-a-0039 214.158375 224.340750 but the the ice storms really are stressful on all the the plants that we have around we've noticed that crepe myrtles don't do as well as they used to
sw3251A-ms98-a-0040 224.340750 232.738375 and uh pittosporum that used to be the kind of things we could plant all the time you you really take a chance with them freezing
