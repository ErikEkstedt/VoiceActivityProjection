sw3271B-ms98-a-0038 182.388500 190.707500 my husband that's one thing he hated was our cat used to sleep with us our dog wasn't interested in even coming in our room but our cat would sleep with us and he hated that
sw3271B-ms98-a-0039 190.707500 198.559625 um-hum he just thought that they belon[g]- and when h[e'd]- she'd walk on the couch along the back behind his head he hated that 
sw3271B-ms98-a-0040 198.559625 207.496125 so i guess it's probably probably if we get another animal it probably wouldn't be a cat even though i love cats i think it would probably be a dog and it would definitely be an outdoor animal

sw3271B-ms98-a-0047 234.114250 245.840500 they just i[t]- needs to be put to sleep but it's grandpa's dog and h[e]- he is really getting too old to take care of it but the dog messes all over the carpet and my daughter is just nine months old
sw3271B-ms98-a-0048 245.840500 253.360750 and so then she crawls on the carpet oh the smell i mean it's just really awful and that's that's one real drawback but
sw3271B-ms98-a-0049 253.360750 257.808625 you know i guess you'll do just about anything for your pet if you love them_1 enough [laughter]
