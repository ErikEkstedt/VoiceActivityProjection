sw3271A-ms98-a-0010 59.350750 66.105250 that's because they have a Great Dane [laughter] which is huge [laughter]
sw3271A-ms98-a-0011 66.105250 79.202250 [silence]

sw3271A-ms98-a-0013 81.898125 83.373250 [silence]
sw3271A-ms98-a-0014 83.373250 91.557625 yes i have never wanted a that's why we've never gotten a female you know in anything and uh uh
sw3271A-ms98-a-0015 91.557625 99.250875 and our male cat you know we had uh neutered right away and course it he doesn't know it and he's still out partying
sw3271A-ms98-a-0016 99.250875 106.100625 but um you know i do think that maybe we'll get a female next time and just had her have her spayed you know

sw3271A-ms98-a-0020 112.260750 114.973000 [silence]
sw3271A-ms98-a-0021 114.973000 123.985250 yes yes which i think is a good thing it just breaks my heart to see these poor little old dogs wandering the streets looking starved and you know
sw3271A-ms98-a-0022 123.985250 130.692250 it uh plus uh you know the safety factor and stuff well we enjoy having pets we uh
sw3271A-ms98-a-0023 130.692250 143.267000 you know i think they're a lot of company and and when my mother lived with us uh the cat was really hers and and he was kind of wild our our daughter found her and brought her to us and uh
sw3271A-ms98-a-0024 143.267000 154.487000 that cat walked in and walked right up to my mother and jumped up and curled up in her lap and she was the only one at first that you know could really hold him you know because_1 he was really skittish but it was like he knew
sw3271A-ms98-a-0025 154.487000 168.609000 you know and he'd sleep with her and so he was a lot of company to her you know and and just love her and he's cats are usually so independent but this one you know he comes up and he crawls up next to my husband now you know uh
sw3271A-ms98-a-0026 168.609000 182.525500 he's you know [laughter] right before the dog died we have a queen size bed and the dog would sleep on my side and the cat would [laughter-sleep] [laughter-on] [laughter-my] [laughter-husband's] [laughter-side] [laughter-you] [laughter-know] [laughter] and when everybody turned we all four of [laughter-us] [laughter-turned] [laughter-in] [laughter-a] [laughter-row]
sw3271A-ms98-a-0027 182.525500 185.813875 [silence]

sw3271A-ms98-a-0034 200.727750 206.830750 [silence]
sw3271A-ms98-a-0035 206.830750 212.806000 uh-huh um-hum i think that's one of the reasons our because as i said our ou[r]- Schnauzer was old
sw3271A-ms98-a-0036 212.806000 223.323000 and so he was becoming incontinent and so then i would generally have messes in the house and i think that's one of the things that both of us are not wanting to start over with you know
sw3271A-ms98-a-0037 223.323000 229.994625 and uh and it was new carpeting and you know it jus[t]- just [laughter-really] you know upset me no end and uh
sw3271A-ms98-a-0038 229.994625 244.774000 [silence]
sw3271A-ms98-a-0039 244.774000 247.069250 [laughter-oh]

sw3271A-ms98-a-0042 250.715750 257.025500 [silence]
sw3271A-ms98-a-0043 257.025500 261.778375 yes you will you will you know we were trying to decide uh
sw3271A-ms98-a-0044 261.778375 272.184250 you know about putting him to sleep he was just you know he was getting so old and had that other problems too and and fortunately the decision was just taken away from us which made it a whole lot easier
sw3271A-ms98-a-0045 272.184250 281.372750 you know and and again going through that because our our animals are almost like our kids in some ways you know and and you grieve just as much over them when they go
sw3271A-ms98-a-0046 281.372750 288.981125 you know as you would a child and and you know our son and and his wife and our daughter and her husband the grandkids all say
