sw3238A-ms98-a-0023 84.344125 86.286375 [silence]
sw3238A-ms98-a-0024 86.286375 90.717750 ho[w]- how many kids do you have two are they young or
sw3238A-ms98-a-0025 90.717750 94.985250 five and two i have two and mine are two and nine months
sw3238A-ms98-a-0026 94.985250 102.611750 so um being being home is real i- i just am fortunate because i don't know a real lot of moms that get to stay home 
sw3238A-ms98-a-0027 102.611750 110.410375 and uh i just it's just weird that i was just talking to somebody this morning who's who's a working uh lady a working mom and
sw3238A-ms98-a-0028 110.410375 119.420375 you know these people have secretaries and these high power jobs and it just seems like um she she told me now her daughter took her first steps at the day care
sw3238A-ms98-a-0029 119.420375 122.211500 and uh i just think i- i
sw3238A-ms98-a-0030 122.211500 125.235125 i just don't agree with that i think it should be
sw3238A-ms98-a-0031 125.235125 129.071375 that people should get back to staying home and
sw3238A-ms98-a-0032 129.071375 134.567000 and being family more family oriented than than not
sw3238A-ms98-a-0033 134.567000 143.143750 you know it seems like everybody's always so busy with everything that they're doing that there's no time for this and that and the other and i hope it just doesn't get to where
sw3238A-ms98-a-0034 143.143750 147.471500 you know there's more women more and more women going into the work force
sw3238A-ms98-a-0035 147.471500 156.394375 [silence]
sw3238A-ms98-a-0036 156.394375 157.922875 yeah
sw3238A-ms98-a-0037 157.922875 163.503250 [silence]
sw3238A-ms98-a-0038 163.503250 164.895625 um-hum
sw3238A-ms98-a-0039 164.895625 172.770625 [silence]
sw3238A-ms98-a-0040 172.770625 185.788875 yeah well i find that i whenever i have to whenever i'm in a group of people and we're discussing things like just over the weekend i visited my family and some cousins i hadn't seen in a long time and everyone's all interested in what everybody's doing
sw3238A-ms98-a-0041 185.788875 198.485375 and uh you know well i had my baby with me and i found that all i talked about was my baby which was fine with me but it's like you know here these people are they're going to school getting degrees making all this money and you know they kind of looked at me like i was
sw3238A-ms98-a-0042 198.485375 207.958375 from the dark ages [laughter] you know like i because_1 i didn't have really all that much to talk about uh where career and things like that were concerned
sw3238A-ms98-a-0043 207.958375 211.862250 i mean you kind of feel little bit like an outcast for a while
sw3238A-ms98-a-0044 211.862250 214.725625 in social situations sometimes
sw3238A-ms98-a-0045 214.725625 216.993375 which is too bad because you know
sw3238A-ms98-a-0046 216.993375 229.820250 i- i feel like i don't obviously i don't get paid for my job but i should get paid at least double what my husband makes [laughter] working in an office for staying home that's what i figure i'm worth a lot as for what i do
sw3238A-ms98-a-0047 229.820250 231.469875 every day
sw3238A-ms98-a-0048 231.469875 234.447375 but you know i don't know
sw3238A-ms98-a-0049 234.447375 237.010500 he's kind of a um
sw3238A-ms98-a-0050 237.010500 241.210625 at at least here i've noticed i'm not from here i'm from Colorado
sw3238A-ms98-a-0051 241.210625 249.797250 but i've really noticed that there are a lot of uh a lot more people that are more comfortable at least with some women being home and
sw3238A-ms98-a-0052 249.797250 256.868125 at least in the circles i've traveled and in the church that i go to you know that men don't treat you like you don't know anything generally
sw3238A-ms98-a-0053 256.868125 258.712625 speaking
sw3238A-ms98-a-0054 258.712625 269.584375 [silence]
sw3238A-ms98-a-0055 269.584375 271.072250 yeah

sw3238A-ms98-a-0058 291.783125 296.088250 yeah i can see where that would definitely hinder the problem
sw3238A-ms98-a-0059 296.088250 297.938750 definitely
sw3238A-ms98-a-0060 297.938750 298.562000 we[ll]-
