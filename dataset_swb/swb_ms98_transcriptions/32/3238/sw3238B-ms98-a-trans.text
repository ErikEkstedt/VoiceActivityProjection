sw3238B-ms98-a-0018 52.901375 59.804000 i you know i think it's kind of coming back around to that don't you i mean that there's a lot more people that stay home now than before but
sw3238B-ms98-a-0019 59.804000 66.339125 i guess more than anything i think maybe people were just kind of wanting to have the choice of what they could do you know
sw3238B-ms98-a-0020 66.339125 67.388125 [silence]
sw3238B-ms98-a-0021 67.388125 75.841000 i don't know i mean i think sometimes some of the the women's lib though is kind of like they wanted it all you know and you can't have everything
sw3238B-ms98-a-0022 75.841000 83.497875 i don't i don't think that you can have i mean there's no way i could have a career and then be the kind of mom that i wanna be
sw3238B-ms98-a-0023 83.497875 85.694875 and to me that's more important
sw3238B-ms98-a-0024 85.694875 87.590750 [silence]
sw3238B-ms98-a-0025 87.590750 88.801000 two

sw3238B-ms98-a-0029 146.565750 158.254125 well i agree i mean but i- i hate for them to make people feel bad that have to work too saying you know you should stay home you know otherwise your children aren't going to you know turn out or whatever because that's not fair to
sw3238B-ms98-a-0030 158.254125 163.931750 you know like the single moms that have to work or if they wouldn't be able to make ends meet
sw3238B-ms98-a-0031 163.931750 169.720750 not working or whatever i mean i think it's got to be a personal choice and
sw3238B-ms98-a-0032 169.720750 173.682000 it's nice that that we could have the choice to stay home
sw3238B-ms98-a-0033 173.682000 189.437000 [silence]

sw3238B-ms98-a-0042 257.837000 270.154125 well and i think a lot of companies are realizing this and offering more opportunities as far as like job sharing or you know even having a day care on site and that kind of stuff and i think that's really important
sw3238B-ms98-a-0043 270.154125 275.127875 that that they do that and they realize there's a need for that and um
sw3238B-ms98-a-0044 275.127875 282.510625 i don't know i found when i did do some work when my son was young it was like contract work and it wasn't where i had to be there every day but
sw3238B-ms98-a-0045 282.510625 291.333750 i mean we're going to the doctor once a week so i don't know how you could have a full time job and ever have any vacation time to do anything besides go to the [laughter-doctor]
