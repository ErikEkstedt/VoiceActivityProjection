sw3239A-ms98-a-0011 30.635750 34.564125 [silence]
sw3239A-ms98-a-0012 34.564125 40.790625 yes um we have one dog a Bichon Frise um
sw3239A-ms98-a-0013 40.790625 44.992625 our friends in Houston bred the dogs i had never heard of them
sw3239A-ms98-a-0014 44.992625 54.795250 they're um they're all white and they're small and um and fluffy they don't shed i guess they are distantly related to a poodle but
sw3239A-ms98-a-0015 54.795250 59.696500 they're not very well known in this country and they're not um high strung or over bred
sw3239A-ms98-a-0016 59.696500 61.118500 um
sw3239A-ms98-a-0017 61.118500 70.482375 ours is uh on the small end and she's about ten pounds and they range from probably ten to sixteen pounds
sw3239A-ms98-a-0018 70.482375 73.167625 and they love people um
sw3239A-ms98-a-0019 73.167625 78.063500 and kids and that was something we were looking for um
sw3239A-ms98-a-0020 78.063500 81.835625 our our love is Golden Retrievers and
sw3239A-ms98-a-0021 81.835625 92.360000 that's what we had intended to get in Houston but we had a small yard and a pool and knowing how they love to dig and love the water um and we thought that was kind of a tough climate
sw3239A-ms98-a-0022 92.360000 100.409625 so uh we ended up getting this and uh my son would rather have a Golden Retriever though i think [laughter] now he wants a
sw3239A-ms98-a-0023 100.409625 102.932125 a good size dog [laughter]
sw3239A-ms98-a-0024 102.932125 115.549500 [silence]

sw3239A-ms98-a-0027 118.597500 120.900500 [silence]
sw3239A-ms98-a-0028 120.900500 133.342000 what they really are um they're really sweet dogs we've uh we thought probably our neighborhood in Houston had more of this breed than any other place just because of um
sw3239A-ms98-a-0029 133.342000 141.999500 the family that had them and and bred them they had five litters of puppies and and a lot of them stayed in the neighborhood because um
sw3239A-ms98-a-0030 141.999500 143.294000 [noise] they
sw3239A-ms98-a-0031 143.294000 149.098875 it's B I C H O N F R I S E

sw3239A-ms98-a-0035 159.335500 162.563250 yeah they're uh
sw3239A-ms98-a-0036 162.563250 170.381750 and they don't shed so they're they're good dogs for people with with allergies and they love people i mean they're
sw3239A-ms98-a-0037 170.381750 174.658125 um no not really ours um
sw3239A-ms98-a-0038 174.658125 177.626125 ours barks more than uh than
sw3239A-ms98-a-0039 177.626125 187.333500 some because she spent a lot of time at our friends house we used to swap back and forth dogs that they have three dogs they had a Cockapoo and and two Bichons um
sw3239A-ms98-a-0040 187.333500 191.292375 and she didn't bark at all until she spent time there and and um
sw3239A-ms98-a-0041 191.292375 195.523250 now it's funny she's she's a good watch dog i mean if there's
sw3239A-ms98-a-0042 195.523250 199.297000 um she'll bark that way but she also talk a lot she
sw3239A-ms98-a-0043 199.297000 200.350875 um
sw3239A-ms98-a-0044 200.350875 207.491250 [noise] has a definite personality and so if we're leaving her she barks at us because she doesn't want to be left um
sw3239A-ms98-a-0045 207.491250 217.131125 no no and they're um they're very smart dogs the circuses in Europe used to use them um for the acts they uh
sw3239A-ms98-a-0046 217.131125 220.770750 oh they'll dance on their hind legs each
sw3239A-ms98-a-0047 220.770750 225.480250 um [noise] but they're very easy to train and
sw3239A-ms98-a-0048 225.480250 226.900250 [silence]
sw3239A-ms98-a-0049 226.900250 240.297750 well they range i'd noticed up here they're a lot more expensive it seemed to me from the ads in the paper they run anywhere from two hundred to four hundred dollars i think which i thought was a lot [laughter]
sw3239A-ms98-a-0050 240.297750 241.608500 [silence]
sw3239A-ms98-a-0051 241.608500 247.521250 well she's no longer breeding them but um because her dogs um
sw3239A-ms98-a-0052 247.521250 258.079500 the the second one that she has was one of the puppies from the litter and uh the one male that she used had a tooth problem
sw3239A-ms98-a-0053 258.079500 270.128125 and so she only bred that dog once because it had the tooth problem and did them strictly as um pets you know they weren't weren't show quality
