sw3287A-ms98-a-0040 162.480625 171.661000 i think for a long period of time that's what Doug uh always gives up t[oo]- too soon before it really starts feeling the real benefits from it
sw3287A-ms98-a-0041 171.661000 178.908250 but no i meant uh months yeah i mean regularly for months because um
sw3287A-ms98-a-0042 178.908250 187.164375 uh [vocalized-noise] the first time i started ru[nning]- i used to run and i ran for six months with these friends and after that
sw3287A-ms98-a-0043 187.164375 200.693625 i s[tarted]- i really saw the difference i i only did it before then because it was just fun to meet them and go run and uh but after that i i mean i changed sizes i didn't lose much weight but i changed sizes and um
sw3287A-ms98-a-0044 200.693625 209.645125 and i really could see a difference i could see a difference when i played tennis and that kind of thing you know just had much more stamina and and all that but
