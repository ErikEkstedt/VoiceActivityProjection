sw3245A-ms98-a-0046 138.824500 141.393250 and i had one that was born in December
sw3245A-ms98-a-0047 141.393250 156.000625 so um it was a little bit b[ecause]- however it was a real warm winter so even even into like November and December i was still wearing the short sleeve dresses course i'm always hot when i'm pregnant too so [laughter] i didn't really need warm clothes
sw3245A-ms98-a-0048 156.000625 162.863000 but i really have been spoiled by sweat pants and these new uh units outfits you know that are just knit
sw3245A-ms98-a-0049 162.863000 171.762875 oh they're so comfortable it's it's just um you know a light weight kind of like a sweat suit but made out of that real light polyester stuff and
sw3245A-ms98-a-0050 171.762875 183.961000 it's just great because you can put you know you can decorate them_1 up or dress them_1 up if you want or you can just wear them_1 with you know tennis shoes if you want so they're really nice [noise] and i've enjoyed wearing those
sw3245A-ms98-a-0051 183.961000 186.036125 but i

sw3245A-ms98-a-0054 197.634125 201.166625 i worked part time when my oldest was a baby
sw3245A-ms98-a-0055 201.166625 204.403250 and um i had to wear a dress every day and
sw3245A-ms98-a-0056 204.403250 205.954625 [silence]
sw3245A-ms98-a-0057 205.954625 209.381000 and uh it was a little bit hard to uh
sw3245A-ms98-a-0058 209.381000 219.477750 wind down i would i would have to drive six thirty five home and i would be burning up like in the summer time by the time i got home i was like oh i got to get out of these clothes [laughter]
