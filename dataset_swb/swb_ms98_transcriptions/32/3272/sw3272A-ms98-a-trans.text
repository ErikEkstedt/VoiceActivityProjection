sw3272A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 4.363875 [noise] okay i don't [noise] do you have a opinion on that on the [USR/USSR]
sw3272A-ms98-a-0002 4.363875 13.830125 [silence]
sw3272A-ms98-a-0003 13.830125 15.247000 uh-huh
sw3272A-ms98-a-0004 15.247000 22.184750 [silence]
sw3272A-ms98-a-0005 22.184750 23.574500 sure
sw3272A-ms98-a-0006 23.574500 24.938125 [silence]
sw3272A-ms98-a-0007 24.938125 27.337500 um-hum sure
sw3272A-ms98-a-0008 27.337500 41.647625 [silence]
sw3272A-ms98-a-0009 41.647625 43.127000 sure
sw3272A-ms98-a-0010 43.127000 47.542375 [silence]
sw3272A-ms98-a-0011 47.542375 49.713625 sure that happens [noise]
sw3272A-ms98-a-0012 49.713625 53.356750 [silence]
sw3272A-ms98-a-0013 53.356750 54.719375 uh-huh
sw3272A-ms98-a-0014 54.719375 57.766875 [silence]
sw3272A-ms98-a-0015 57.766875 63.590625 sure i guess in particular my viewpoint is that they financially cannot
sw3272A-ms98-a-0016 63.590625 76.117750 go into a war uh they are desperate at this point in time to keep their country together but i could not foresee them [noise] severing what they have with the US
sw3272A-ms98-a-0017 76.117750 87.081750 um because they need us at this current time because of their financial situation um from what i've been hearing is the US[SR]- uh -[US]SR has been uh almost bankrupt
sw3272A-ms98-a-0018 87.081750 97.909625 for years and it's people are desperate and there might be a revolution within the people [noise] but i don't think the US would get involved with it because uh there's too close of ties to where [noise]
sw3272A-ms98-a-0019 97.909625 103.712125 i think they understand that Gorbachev is trying to make a change and that we cannot run
sw3272A-ms98-a-0020 103.712125 117.691750 them like we run the US and that they have to make their own independent decision so i guess i really have no fear at all of the USSR verses uh you get these small little uh places like Iraq and all of that that
sw3272A-ms98-a-0021 117.691750 124.472250 might be something that i'd be more concerned about with nuclear weapons versus a a small
sw3272A-ms98-a-0022 124.472250 133.088500 uh or the big country of USSR i- i- i have no feelings that they would ever start a war with us because to them it would
sw3272A-ms98-a-0023 133.088500 141.332500 totally [vocalized-noise] you know it would totally destroy their whole country because our technology is far advanced from what theirs is at this current time
sw3272A-ms98-a-0024 141.332500 145.810125 so i mean sure they have weapons to kill us over and over and over but
sw3272A-ms98-a-0025 145.810125 156.984625 to them that would be a suicide and they and the Russian people are not suicidal type of people but if you get the Iraqis and Iran which will do it for the country for the pleasure of
sw3272A-ms98-a-0026 156.984625 162.249125 you know doing whatever uh for their country they'll do it uh
