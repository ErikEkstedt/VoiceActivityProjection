sw3282B-ms98-a-0005 13.079000 20.935375 yeah i think it kind of uh it didn't really take over the first page quite as much as it did i think during the war
sw3282B-ms98-a-0006 20.935375 22.461750 but uh
sw3282B-ms98-a-0007 22.461750 26.693750 we definitely need something there with all the hostages and
sw3282B-ms98-a-0008 26.693750 28.040375 what all
sw3282B-ms98-a-0009 28.040375 32.011250 [silence]

sw3282B-ms98-a-0014 49.813250 56.460375 oh well you know i just see this Middle East situation with with Russia and
sw3282B-ms98-a-0015 56.460375 66.694250 everything there that's happened i think that that crisis has kind of slowed down and i see the Middle East as being you know the real hot spot of the future so to speak
sw3282B-ms98-a-0016 66.694250 71.725250 so i guess i v[iew]- view it as being the prime importance as far as
sw3282B-ms98-a-0017 71.725250 73.909375 trying to negotiate trying to
sw3282B-ms98-a-0018 73.909375 77.732250 wind down some of the tensions and everything that are there
sw3282B-ms98-a-0019 77.732250 93.980375 [silence]

sw3282B-ms98-a-0026 120.038250 126.595625 i guess the question in my mind somewhat and and it depends on the country you know i think some are more peaceful than others
sw3282B-ms98-a-0027 126.595625 134.485375 if you look at um Iraq for example and you know the recent thing with the UN going in there and the the
sw3282B-ms98-a-0028 134.485375 140.671375 bomb development and all this kind of stuff you know uh gosh i think you know we should have
sw3282B-ms98-a-0029 140.671375 143.139250 got him while we [laughter-could]
sw3282B-ms98-a-0030 143.139250 144.762750 or whatever
sw3282B-ms98-a-0031 144.762750 153.151000 and i think there's a certain mentality to that that's in the Middle East you know that's this constant fighting you know and
sw3282B-ms98-a-0032 153.151000 163.863625 [silence]
sw3282B-ms98-a-0033 163.863625 167.509625 yeah i think they they look at force as a way of
sw3282B-ms98-a-0034 167.509625 170.522000 y[ou]- you know their their means to their ends
sw3282B-ms98-a-0035 170.522000 174.938625 and um so i you know i don't know so much if these peace talks are gonna
sw3282B-ms98-a-0036 174.938625 182.700625 i don't know how much they'll stay to them you know if if even if we say that we're going to do stuff i don't know how they'll stick to that

sw3282B-ms98-a-0052 244.038125 247.224500 a lot of times their slogan is might makes right
