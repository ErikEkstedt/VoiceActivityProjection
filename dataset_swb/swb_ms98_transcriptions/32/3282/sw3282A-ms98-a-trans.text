sw3282A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 5.059500 [noise] uh all right Carolyn do you are you reading the papers about the the Middle East summit
sw3282A-ms98-a-0002 5.059500 6.234750 [silence]
sw3282A-ms98-a-0003 6.234750 13.396000 yes i'm just a little bit too i think um i think i was worn ou[t]- worn out from Middle East after the war
sw3282A-ms98-a-0004 13.396000 19.586750 [silence]
sw3282A-ms98-a-0005 19.586750 20.880875 um-hum
sw3282A-ms98-a-0006 20.880875 25.862625 [silence]
sw3282A-ms98-a-0007 25.862625 34.281375 yeah yeah wh[at]- that's i think uh i don't know in the short run it would be really nice to get the hostages all back i think that's really uh
sw3282A-ms98-a-0008 34.281375 40.952875 really important i- i- i- c[an't]- i guess we grew up in such a different world i could never even imagine taking hostages
sw3282A-ms98-a-0009 40.952875 49.005875 but i think they just have a whole different world than we do so i don't know but i don't know what do you think some of the long term repercussions might be
sw3282A-ms98-a-0010 49.005875 63.667375 [silence]
sw3282A-ms98-a-0011 63.667375 64.664875 um
sw3282A-ms98-a-0012 64.664875 65.673000 [silence]
sw3282A-ms98-a-0013 65.673000 66.748000 yeah
sw3282A-ms98-a-0014 66.748000 70.956125 [silence]
sw3282A-ms98-a-0015 70.956125 72.017250 um-hum
sw3282A-ms98-a-0016 72.017250 77.780250 [silence]
sw3282A-ms98-a-0017 77.780250 79.406625 yeah i think um
sw3282A-ms98-a-0018 79.406625 87.652000 i don't know i have uh i just have this this civil rights mentality i- i guess you know should we or or you know sh[ould]- should we
sw3282A-ms98-a-0019 87.652000 94.470375 uh those i wish those countries could have the same type of freedoms or whatever that we do
sw3282A-ms98-a-0020 94.470375 101.823250 and i guess that's what i- i hope for them but some of them don't want those freedoms i think their their religious beliefs may um
sw3282A-ms98-a-0021 101.823250 110.145750 may not you know they may not want it as a whole so i think that's something that has to be considered too but i think that's a that's really a long term
sw3282A-ms98-a-0022 110.145750 119.385250 type thing i don't know the the it said think about long term repercussions and i was just thinking well peace is peace you know and that's really is the nicest thing
sw3282A-ms98-a-0023 119.385250 125.395500 [silence]
sw3282A-ms98-a-0024 125.395500 127.254625 um-hum yeah
sw3282A-ms98-a-0025 127.254625 128.873250 [silence]
sw3282A-ms98-a-0026 128.873250 130.177875 yeah
sw3282A-ms98-a-0027 130.177875 132.580250 [silence]
sw3282A-ms98-a-0028 132.580250 133.686375 um-hum
sw3282A-ms98-a-0029 133.686375 141.580625 [silence]
sw3282A-ms98-a-0030 141.580625 145.613750 [laughter-yeah] yes i- i think so i think um
sw3282A-ms98-a-0031 145.613750 152.717875 [silence]
sw3282A-ms98-a-0032 152.717875 165.143375 right i think i think they realized we would probably never push him out and uh i think the other probably all of the other Arab countries said that we were sort of wimpy for not forcing him out because_1
sw3282A-ms98-a-0033 165.143375 167.018500 [silence]
sw3282A-ms98-a-0034 167.018500 168.303500 um-hum
sw3282A-ms98-a-0035 168.303500 169.781375 [silence]
sw3282A-ms98-a-0036 169.781375 171.500625 yeah yep
sw3282A-ms98-a-0037 171.500625 177.445375 [silence]
sw3282A-ms98-a-0038 177.445375 178.627875 um-hum
sw3282A-ms98-a-0039 178.627875 181.842000 [silence]
sw3282A-ms98-a-0040 181.842000 183.281125 yeah
sw3282A-ms98-a-0041 183.281125 186.120875 i- i think the the thing is though i- i guess
sw3282A-ms98-a-0042 186.120875 187.500000 the
sw3282A-ms98-a-0043 187.500000 200.441250 the Arab countries that used to argue with us or not support any i[deas]- ideas that that coincide with the the US ideas or whatever used to probably receive money from the Soviet Union
sw3282A-ms98-a-0044 200.441250 207.847875 and i guess that's all gone i think that's really uh probably what started the whole process [laughter] i
sw3282A-ms98-a-0045 207.847875 209.452625 yeah
sw3282A-ms98-a-0046 209.452625 214.753375 i think i think that they're s[o]- they're so much more vulnerable now because they don't receive support
sw3282A-ms98-a-0047 214.753375 226.033750 from the Soviet Union so i guess they're saying well you know we can eat two ways or we can get this aid free from these countries f[rom]- two ways we can either act like we're gonna be
sw3282A-ms98-a-0048 226.033750 229.599750 pro communist or act like we're going to be pro uh
sw3282A-ms98-a-0049 229.599750 239.816000 pro democracy and whatever gets us the most out of it that's what we'll act like we're going to do but we really won't change in the long run i think that's the way i sort of see them all working you know
sw3282A-ms98-a-0050 239.816000 240.824375 [silence]
sw3282A-ms98-a-0051 240.824375 242.033125 yeah
sw3282A-ms98-a-0052 242.033125 246.605125 [silence]
sw3282A-ms98-a-0053 246.605125 247.948625 um-hum
sw3282A-ms98-a-0054 247.948625 255.937500 [silence]
sw3282A-ms98-a-0055 255.937500 264.759875 yeah it's it's really funny as an American and always being an ally with the Israelis i always find it very hard in my heart
sw3282A-ms98-a-0056 264.759875 277.021125 to al[ign]- to align with the Israelis because they seem to be just as bad as the Arabs [noise] you know but then again they have to live in that environment they have to be subjected to
sw3282A-ms98-a-0057 277.021125 283.477875 all of the Arab bombings and terrorist attacks and whatever and they have to negotiate
sw3282A-ms98-a-0058 283.477875 291.540500 almost everything and then you think to yourself well you know in your heart you don't want to be aligned with somebody that's mean and cruel to someone else
sw3282A-ms98-a-0059 291.540500 299.522000 but if that's the environment that they have to live in and survive in then you have to sort of like i don't know logically
