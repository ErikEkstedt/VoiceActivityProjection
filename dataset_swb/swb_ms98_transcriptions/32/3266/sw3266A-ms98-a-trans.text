sw3266A-ms98-a-0020 77.859375 83.084000 i've always thought you know it would be really tough what if you had a fire or something with babies
sw3266A-ms98-a-0021 83.084000 87.967500 you would have to be able to have enough you know you'd have to be able to get them_1 all out

sw3266A-ms98-a-0027 108.981750 112.515000 but you could put them_1 in one of these cribs and then roll the crib out i guess
sw3266A-ms98-a-0028 112.515000 114.592125 oh well that's neat

sw3266A-ms98-a-0060 238.419375 246.284875 i hear a lot of the girls i work with uh constantly oh i wish i could find someplace i really felt good about you know
sw3266A-ms98-a-0061 246.284875 251.184750 most of them_1 don't really feel that it's a great place to leave their kids
sw3266A-ms98-a-0062 251.184750 262.369500 and it's really bad you know one of the girls she was leaving hers at where she felt like was a really good place and then they called her one afternoon and said well we thought we'd better call and tell you before you got over here
sw3266A-ms98-a-0063 262.369500 267.614125 Lacy fell asleep on the bus after our field trip today and we just now found her

sw3266A-ms98-a-0066 272.631750 283.039625 and so immediately she says well i can't have any confidence in them anymore if they'll take a group of kids to the zoo or somewhere and then come back and not even count them_1 and realize they're one short
sw3266A-ms98-a-0067 283.039625 290.026750 but one of the teachers happened to walk by and see her pounding on the window trying to get out of the bus and this was four hours later you know
