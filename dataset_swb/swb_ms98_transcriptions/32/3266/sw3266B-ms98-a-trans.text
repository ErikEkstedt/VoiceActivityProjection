sw3266B-ms98-a-0017 42.947125 54.364875 i- i think so i think it's hard to find a good day care i have worked in an[other]- at some other ones that were not very good in my opinion but this one that i'm in now is
sw3266B-ms98-a-0018 54.364875 62.312500 is very good and one of the key things is how many adults are there [vocalized-noise] in ratio to the children
sw3266B-ms98-a-0019 62.312500 69.770125 an[d]- like in Pennsylvania for babies that's what i work with there has to be a one to four ratio at the most
sw3266B-ms98-a-0020 69.770125 74.982250 no more than four babies per care giver but we keep it down to like two to one
sw3266B-ms98-a-0021 74.982250 78.972250 yeah that makes a little easier to deal with
sw3266B-ms98-a-0022 78.972250 82.334125 [silence]
sw3266B-ms98-a-0023 82.334125 84.171875 oh i know we

sw3266B-ms98-a-0025 87.320250 101.672625 what we do is we have these cribs in the back room where they sleep that are um low to the ground and they're reinforced real strong and they'll sit four babies we would just lie them in there and they r[oll]- roll real well and maneuver
sw3266B-ms98-a-0026 101.672625 103.361125 that [noise] get them_1 out
sw3266B-ms98-a-0027 103.361125 108.202250 [silence]

sw3266B-ms98-a-0031 114.144500 117.999375 yeah that's certainly something we hope [laughter-never] happens
sw3266B-ms98-a-0032 117.999375 122.001125 [silence]
sw3266B-ms98-a-0033 122.001125 131.692500 most really care in this center really care uh most everyone has a college degree in like early childhood education
sw3266B-ms98-a-0034 131.692500 144.222375 and really there's only like eight children per room and there's like two or three mo[stly]- mostly three care givers in each room and that enables them to spend more time with the children
sw3266B-ms98-a-0035 144.222375 153.311625 sometimes tha[t]- i feel like all i'm doing is changing diapers giving bottles and putting babies down for a nap so it's nice to be able to play with them and really get to know them
sw3266B-ms98-a-0036 153.311625 156.226875 it's easy get attached to them too
sw3266B-ms98-a-0037 156.226875 161.064000 [silence]
sw3266B-ms98-a-0038 161.064000 166.997250 um in my room they go from eight weeks to nine months

sw3266B-ms98-a-0047 188.867375 194.602625 not quite it's a whe[n]- they start to crawl they try to climb up on things and
sw3266B-ms98-a-0048 194.602625 203.051000 you have to be real careful all the everything is baby proof you know all the doors have latches and stuff so they can't get into anything but they try

sw3266B-ms98-a-0052 215.657375 224.321125 a lot of college educated people and stuff that are in the centers that really seem to have an idea of what's going on and um
sw3266B-ms98-a-0053 224.321125 230.281375 in general though i['ve]- i've been really disappointed with a lot of other centers i've worked at an[d]-
sw3266B-ms98-a-0054 230.281375 237.251625 it all and all it's not my choice for when when i have children but some people [noise] don't [noise] have
