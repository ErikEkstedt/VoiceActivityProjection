sw3285A-ms98-a-0052 140.222000 146.005500 and and it's even what what kills me even more is what we've allowed to go over the television
sw3285A-ms98-a-0053 146.005500 149.972625 you know movies are one thing where there is some type of rating
sw3285A-ms98-a-0054 149.972625 154.680000 but TV is out of control as far as i'm concerned

sw3285A-ms98-a-0058 162.817250 164.049750 [silence]
sw3285A-ms98-a-0059 164.049750 165.909250 yeah that's the truth
sw3285A-ms98-a-0060 165.909250 169.860125 um one of the movies i'm i just moved here from South Dakota

sw3285A-ms98-a-0071 201.774250 213.455000 yeah the the hardest part with that is that it was very you know good from a historical part of it but to you know for now there was a lot of um discrimination feelings coming back out
sw3285A-ms98-a-0072 213.455000 219.739875 you know living up there with you know the tribes and things like that it started to come back it started to surface again
