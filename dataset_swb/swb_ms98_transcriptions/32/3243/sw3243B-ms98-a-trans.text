sw3243B-ms98-a-0017 44.445750 46.617500 i i didn't think it was quite as good as the first one
sw3243B-ms98-a-0018 46.617500 51.164750 [silence]
sw3243B-ms98-a-0019 51.164750 52.220375 yeah
sw3243B-ms98-a-0020 52.220375 53.695375 it was it was pretty clever
sw3243B-ms98-a-0021 53.695375 54.972875 and then we saw
sw3243B-ms98-a-0022 54.972875 57.638625 the one that was the kind of the spoof of Top Gun
sw3243B-ms98-a-0023 57.638625 58.210250 [silence]
sw3243B-ms98-a-0024 58.210250 64.013500 there was they were kind of along the same lines but i i didn't enjoy that one near as much i didn't it wasn't as well done i don't think
sw3243B-ms98-a-0025 64.013500 64.522125 [silence]
sw3243B-ms98-a-0026 64.522125 73.915375 but uh and i'm trying to remember we've seen some other goods ones but uh and and then Silence of the Lambs that one kept me thinking for a month
sw3243B-ms98-a-0027 73.915375 80.727250 [silence]
sw3243B-ms98-a-0028 80.727250 81.346375 yeah

sw3243B-ms98-a-0076 234.744375 242.768875 there there are several like that uh another one i saw that me and my wife really talked about after it was over was uh Sex Lies and Videotape

sw3243B-ms98-a-0080 253.401375 266.122000 it wasn't bad the thing was you know it was interesting the way the their lives intertwined and and and then at the end they all kind of fell apart and you know there are a lot of things to talk about after that you know because it was real interesting
sw3243B-ms98-a-0081 266.122000 268.432625 the interpersonal relationship and stuff
sw3243B-ms98-a-0082 268.432625 268.982750 [silence]
sw3243B-ms98-a-0083 268.982750 280.995125 so it it was a movie that we you know we end up when when you first leave there it's like you know i don't know if i like that movie but then as we get to talk about it its like all these different things that deal with these people or whatever
