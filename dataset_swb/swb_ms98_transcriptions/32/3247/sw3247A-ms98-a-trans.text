sw3247A-ms98-a-0005 12.771000 15.975625 we seem to have a duality of
sw3247A-ms98-a-0006 15.975625 23.436500 in this country where most states in theory have it but but but do not use it
sw3247A-ms98-a-0007 23.436500 54.734000 [silence]

sw3247A-ms98-a-0015 83.609000 93.229125 um-hum i think so [noise] i there there are a lot there or a fair number [noise] uh
sw3247A-ms98-a-0016 93.229125 107.970625 in fact i think that it it affected the the sentence though capital punishment is available the sentence of life without possibility of parole uh has become a common one 
sw3247A-ms98-a-0017 107.970625 110.553250 and it's being being used much more
sw3247A-ms98-a-0018 110.553250 113.716750 [silence]
sw3247A-ms98-a-0019 113.716750 120.172625 [noise] uh i don't know the exact numbers but but yes prisons are overcrowded

sw3247A-ms98-a-0024 167.138500 169.156250 uh at least in this country
sw3247A-ms98-a-0025 169.156250 177.599750 uh we are i guess the only one of the major Western nations currently with capital punishment
sw3247A-ms98-a-0026 177.599750 181.889500 [silence]
sw3247A-ms98-a-0027 181.889500 188.867750 no at least not in Western Europe probably not in Eastern Europe these days either um
sw3247A-ms98-a-0028 188.867750 194.618625 there are many reasons for it but they they certainly have lower crime rates and lower murder rates
sw3247A-ms98-a-0029 194.618625 199.788875 [silence]
sw3247A-ms98-a-0030 199.788875 207.605250 well in part it's a uh it's the nature of societies perhaps more homogeneous society 
sw3247A-ms98-a-0031 207.605250 221.774875 in many cases uh arguably i[f]- arguably is because of of uh of uh welfare state benefits though i tend to b[e]- we tend to be skeptical
sw3247A-ms98-a-0032 221.774875 229.456375 [silence]
