sw3247B-ms98-a-0023 146.965250 155.294750 capital punishment does not fit the crime [noise] and there are extenuating circumstances on certain types
sw3247B-ms98-a-0024 155.294750 159.777250 um but i have to say that i'm honestly for it
sw3247B-ms98-a-0025 159.777250 164.430250 uh almost that eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
