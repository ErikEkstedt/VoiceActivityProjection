sw2717B-ms98-a-0003 2.917750 8.610375 oh well what's there to say doesn't seem like it's being carried out very well in my opinion
sw2717B-ms98-a-0004 8.610375 11.430250 seems like it takes so long between
sw2717B-ms98-a-0005 11.430250 18.092250 conviction and carrying out the penalty that i don't see that it makes any difference to sentence anybody
sw2717B-ms98-a-0006 18.092250 21.321625 [silence]
sw2717B-ms98-a-0007 21.321625 22.217750 yeah

sw2717B-ms98-a-0009 35.669250 36.729500 yeah
sw2717B-ms98-a-0010 36.729500 37.786750 [silence]
sw2717B-ms98-a-0011 37.786750 43.917875 uh-huh well from what i underst[and]- i saw a statistic just a few days ago um
sw2717B-ms98-a-0012 43.917875 56.763500 so far this ye[ar]- year or was it during the last year somewh[ere]- during a years time i think it was they executed twenty five people in the nation meanwhile there were twenty five hundred people on death row
sw2717B-ms98-a-0013 56.763500 64.051625 [noise] so i i and it's building up you know they're they're convicting them faster than they're executing them so it's really building up
sw2717B-ms98-a-0014 64.051625 67.784375 [silence]
sw2717B-ms98-a-0015 67.784375 68.818625 uh-huh

sw2717B-ms98-a-0025 100.383875 101.976750 yeah
sw2717B-ms98-a-0026 101.976750 105.525375 isn't isn't Maryland where the famous Willy Horton case was
sw2717B-ms98-a-0027 105.525375 108.515750 [silence]
sw2717B-ms98-a-0028 108.515750 112.351750 it was uh that was the one that was used so much in the campaign
sw2717B-ms98-a-0029 112.351750 114.703875 in the politica[l]- in the presidential race
sw2717B-ms98-a-0030 114.703875 115.995375 [silence]
sw2717B-ms98-a-0031 115.995375 120.214500 uh may it may not have been Maryland it may have been Massachusetts i don't remember
sw2717B-ms98-a-0032 120.214500 122.421250 [silence]
sw2717B-ms98-a-0033 122.421250 132.339250 anyway well the question is you know do you think i[t]- it does make a difference in whether or not a criminal commits a crime or do you think it can if it's done right
sw2717B-ms98-a-0034 132.339250 143.629375 [silence]
sw2717B-ms98-a-0035 143.629375 144.992125 if it

sw2717B-ms98-a-0037 152.754000 154.156250 uh-huh

sw2717B-ms98-a-0039 156.775875 158.049875 yeah
sw2717B-ms98-a-0040 158.049875 165.801375 well i think in large measure the reason they don't care it's not because the punishment but so many of the people that commit crimes don't get punished
sw2717B-ms98-a-0041 165.801375 172.497125 the police don't catch them or the courts don't convict them or or they don't serve very much of the time and so uh
sw2717B-ms98-a-0042 172.497125 178.314000 you know their [vocalized-noise] their success rate is very high crime does pay ca[sh]- you can make a good living at it 
sw2717B-ms98-a-0043 178.314000 193.304000 [silence]
sw2717B-ms98-a-0044 193.304000 194.519625 yeah
sw2717B-ms98-a-0045 194.519625 201.759500 [silence]
sw2717B-ms98-a-0046 201.759500 204.671750 last year it was DC i guess Baltimore caught them
sw2717B-ms98-a-0047 204.671750 214.966125 [silence]
sw2717B-ms98-a-0048 214.966125 215.949750 uh-huh
sw2717B-ms98-a-0049 215.949750 217.914875 [silence]
sw2717B-ms98-a-0050 217.914875 220.787000 [laughter] yeah
sw2717B-ms98-a-0051 220.787000 223.512375 [silence]
sw2717B-ms98-a-0052 223.512375 233.920500 yeah the only consolation is so many of the murders are you know the the violent people going against each other and so they you know society's not going to put them to death well at least maybe the guy they cross next time is going to
sw2717B-ms98-a-0053 233.920500 236.719250 uh i think
sw2717B-ms98-a-0054 236.719250 251.462000 i think capital punishment is an appropriate punishment for the kind of people where we say you know this sort of person is just not acceptable to our society and we are there by going to remove them from society not temporarily but permanently
sw2717B-ms98-a-0055 251.462000 255.241125 i mean i i personally think life imprisonment
sw2717B-ms98-a-0056 255.241125 262.358375 i don't think much of li[fe]- of life imprisonment first of all it's never turns out to be life but second you know why should we
sw2717B-ms98-a-0057 262.358375 271.898250 the idea of life imprisonment with no chance of parole well that means you're going to put them in a cage you think it's never ever going to be safe for them to walk the streets again well then
sw2717B-ms98-a-0058 271.898250 278.917125 why bother just execute them because that's that way you're sure they'll never ever going to walk the streets again
sw2717B-ms98-a-0059 278.917125 284.794375 so any any anybody that says life in prison with no chance of parole i'd say uh give them the death penalty
sw2717B-ms98-a-0060 284.794375 286.665250 [silence]
sw2717B-ms98-a-0061 286.665250 287.803750 so

sw2717B-ms98-a-0063 302.313375 305.376500 yeah and and also um
sw2717B-ms98-a-0064 305.376500 306.804000 the
sw2717B-ms98-a-0065 306.804000 319.611625 the thing i don't like about a lot of these court trials and a lot of these appeals is that it's not based on what is true and what is false but rather it's on the rules of evidence what can i hide and what do i have to tell 
sw2717B-ms98-a-0066 319.611625 326.871375 and i think our courts should be geared much more strongly towards finding out the truth than they currently are 
sw2717B-ms98-a-0067 326.871375 332.813500 and and that way we can be sure you know we can find out the truth we can find out what really happened
sw2717B-ms98-a-0068 332.813500 334.581750 and and base
sw2717B-ms98-a-0069 334.581750 341.640625 the ver[dict]- sentence on what the person did not on what we're allowed to let the jury hear
sw2717B-ms98-a-0070 341.640625 358.688375 [silence]
sw2717B-ms98-a-0071 358.688375 359.738625 uh-huh

sw2717B-ms98-a-0075 392.617125 394.771000 just started shooting people
sw2717B-ms98-a-0076 394.771000 397.116000 because they botched the first job and
sw2717B-ms98-a-0077 397.116000 398.702250 so now they're going to get even
sw2717B-ms98-a-0078 398.702250 400.611250 [silence]
sw2717B-ms98-a-0079 400.611250 401.530375 yeah

sw2717B-ms98-a-0085 417.055125 420.033750 so what was the verdict what was the results there
sw2717B-ms98-a-0086 420.033750 421.280500 oh
sw2717B-ms98-a-0087 421.280500 427.331875 [silence]

sw2717B-ms98-a-0094 442.089500 446.132500 the the penalty phase yeah they've decide the penalty separately from the verdict

sw2717B-ms98-a-0096 448.447625 450.227000 [noise]

sw2717B-ms98-a-0101 471.582875 482.543625 yeah well you know you just have to decide you know wha[t]- you well yeah there's really two separate decisions there i guess one is did it really happen the way the the prosecutor said it happened
sw2717B-ms98-a-0102 482.543625 492.319500 you know is this man really guilty and you have to decide that but then you have to decide you know as a member of society what do i want to do with this guy who did this thing
sw2717B-ms98-a-0103 492.319500 500.778500 and that w[ill]- i i've never been on a jury i've never had that experience i'm not sure i'd look forward to making that kind of decision about a man's life
sw2717B-ms98-a-0104 500.778500 505.279750 [silence]
sw2717B-ms98-a-0105 505.279750 506.724125 uh-huh
sw2717B-ms98-a-0106 506.724125 515.475625 [silence]
sw2717B-ms98-a-0107 515.475625 516.325250 yeah
sw2717B-ms98-a-0108 516.325250 518.065375 [silence]
sw2717B-ms98-a-0109 518.065375 529.835250 well the thing i'd be most likely to attach the death penalty to is the violence i mean ye[ah]- i can handle people people selling drugs you know it's it's wrong but
sw2717B-ms98-a-0110 529.835250 542.605750 it it's not worth somebody getting executed for but we hear so much about the violence and how it's not safe to walk the streets because somebody you know these random drive by shootings and that sort of thing
sw2717B-ms98-a-0111 542.605750 548.635625 and the people i'd most likely want to sentence to death are the people that just show a really low regard for human life
sw2717B-ms98-a-0112 548.635625 555.723250 that you know you never know when they're going to turn or hurt the next person because it doesn't really matter to them whether someone else gets hurt or not
sw2717B-ms98-a-0113 555.723250 564.633000 and so i go le[t's]- you know these are the kind of people i would like to ye[ah]- get out of here and get out of circulation and say i don't we don't accept your kind in our society
sw2717B-ms98-a-0114 564.633000 591.724000 [silence]
