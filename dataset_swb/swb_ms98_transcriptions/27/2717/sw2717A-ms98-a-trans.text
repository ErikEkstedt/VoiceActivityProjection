sw2717A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.587875 [silence]
sw2717A-ms98-a-0002 1.587875 3.483625 i'll let you go first
sw2717A-ms98-a-0003 3.483625 18.229000 [silence]
sw2717A-ms98-a-0004 18.229000 21.724000 yeah it seems like they could die of old age waiting to get the death penalty
sw2717A-ms98-a-0005 21.724000 27.811000 yeah i know what you mean um i in Maryland they they do have capital punishment
sw2717A-ms98-a-0006 27.811000 38.330875 and uh i've seen uh a lot of people get convicted sentenced and then just nothing happens just endless endless endless appeals
sw2717A-ms98-a-0007 38.330875 64.024125 [silence]
sw2717A-ms98-a-0008 64.024125 72.878000 yeah what's amazing is some of them have been on death row for a number of years and uh here in Maryland i know we have a real problem with overcrowding in prisons
sw2717A-ms98-a-0009 72.878000 74.690250 uh just
sw2717A-ms98-a-0010 74.690250 80.647125 yeah but i mean in here it's uh to the point where they were letting prisoners go
sw2717A-ms98-a-0011 80.647125 86.038875 uh commuting the sentences of those that were in in jail for lesser crimes
sw2717A-ms98-a-0012 86.038875 93.165125 in order to put more people in into the jails and it was just uh amazing
sw2717A-ms98-a-0013 93.165125 100.865500 to me and of course they made a big deal out of the the few that got out and turned around and committed a crime within five days of getting out and
sw2717A-ms98-a-0014 100.865500 102.492750 being rearrested and
sw2717A-ms98-a-0015 102.492750 104.770125 [silence]
sw2717A-ms98-a-0016 104.770125 106.345375 uh
sw2717A-ms98-a-0017 106.345375 109.447625 i can't remember refresh my memory
sw2717A-ms98-a-0018 109.447625 120.266375 [silence]
sw2717A-ms98-a-0019 120.266375 122.949625 um i don't remember myself
sw2717A-ms98-a-0020 122.949625 133.957000 [silence]
sw2717A-ms98-a-0021 133.957000 135.414125 um
sw2717A-ms98-a-0022 135.414125 139.742250 i think if they if they started executing them on a regular basis
sw2717A-ms98-a-0023 139.742250 148.129125 uh that i think it might make a difference right now i don't see it making a difference i don't see someone not going out there
sw2717A-ms98-a-0024 148.129125 156.538500 and committing murder because they're afraid they're going to get sentenced to death i mean most people out there committing murders like don't care
sw2717A-ms98-a-0025 156.538500 158.589375 they just don't care
sw2717A-ms98-a-0026 158.589375 165.033875 [silence]
sw2717A-ms98-a-0027 165.033875 166.258250 yeah
sw2717A-ms98-a-0028 166.258250 178.088250 [silence]
sw2717A-ms98-a-0029 178.088250 185.805625 yeah yeah and there's uh there's a lot of people here in Baltimore that uh have and we just had uh a real big cocaine bust and
sw2717A-ms98-a-0030 185.805625 193.817000 of course you know they're they're playing it up real big that it was uh looked like it was a very very small ring and they just happened to get lucky and catch the guy
sw2717A-ms98-a-0031 193.817000 198.921750 but i mean uh Baltimore has uh an all time record for the number of deaths
sw2717A-ms98-a-0032 198.921750 202.940250 so far this year i think they've got over a hundred dead already this year
sw2717A-ms98-a-0033 202.940250 204.952250 [silence]
sw2717A-ms98-a-0034 204.952250 210.566250 well it's kind of it's kind of moved up and you have to remember that it it it
sw2717A-ms98-a-0035 210.566250 215.515750 uh there's i think X number of people out there that are going to commit murders
sw2717A-ms98-a-0036 215.515750 224.256375 and uh once you kill off a few of them [laughter] i mean if you murder a guy because he murdered your partner or something like that i mean pretty soon you run out of people to murder
sw2717A-ms98-a-0037 224.256375 251.203875 [silence]
sw2717A-ms98-a-0038 251.203875 252.288125 yeah

sw2717A-ms98-a-0042 286.939750 289.249125 yeah you know it makes sense
sw2717A-ms98-a-0043 289.249125 295.522750 um you know you have the occasional person who may have been falsely accused but i mean
sw2717A-ms98-a-0044 295.522750 302.447250 uh so few and far between uh you know makes good TV movies and that's about it
sw2717A-ms98-a-0045 302.447250 318.875500 [silence]
sw2717A-ms98-a-0046 318.875500 320.166625 yeah

sw2717A-ms98-a-0051 349.275250 357.879875 and uh this man was accused of killing uh i think it was two people uh and shooting a uh policeman
sw2717A-ms98-a-0052 357.879875 371.618750 um point blank in the face of course he didn't die and uh this was during a holdup of a uh uh a restaurant and it came out during the trial that um they had tried to rob another place
sw2717A-ms98-a-0053 371.618750 376.728750 and uh when the guy came out with the bag they thought was money it turned out to be a couple cookies
sw2717A-ms98-a-0054 376.728750 385.716000 and uh you know jumbo cookies and and so they were so upset from robbing this guy you know trying to do this holdup that didn't work
sw2717A-ms98-a-0055 385.716000 394.180125 that they quite literally were mad and went into a restaurant to hold the place up and just started you know shooting people
sw2717A-ms98-a-0056 394.180125 396.215375 you know it's
sw2717A-ms98-a-0057 396.215375 397.792625 yeah

sw2717A-ms98-a-0059 402.907875 409.198750 and uh it turned out that the you know policeman survived to the point that he was able to you know identify the guy
sw2717A-ms98-a-0060 409.198750 414.572125 and of course you know they tried to make the cop look ou[t]- like he was uh a uh no good rotten drunk
sw2717A-ms98-a-0061 414.572125 416.383750 i mean it was amazing [laughter]
sw2717A-ms98-a-0062 416.383750 418.737875 [silence]
sw2717A-ms98-a-0063 418.737875 422.565750 oh he was found guilty yeah he uh um
sw2717A-ms98-a-0064 422.565750 424.670125 last i heard he uh
sw2717A-ms98-a-0065 424.670125 430.652500 he beat a push for the death penalty now whether they finally got it or not i don't know i kind of uh
sw2717A-ms98-a-0066 430.652500 433.071750 stopped listening after a while
sw2717A-ms98-a-0067 433.071750 443.433625 um you know he would come home and and you know after the trial was over he came home and told us what was going on and of course then they had to go back to dec[ide]- you know after
sw2717A-ms98-a-0068 443.433625 445.187500 he had to go
sw2717A-ms98-a-0069 445.187500 446.912875 right
sw2717A-ms98-a-0070 446.912875 453.297750 and uh yeah everybody everybody was pretty much you know let's burn him
sw2717A-ms98-a-0071 453.297750 461.679000 and that's you know that's the way they wanted to do it and he was surprised because he thought there was going to be a problem because he uh you know some people on the case were
sw2717A-ms98-a-0072 461.679000 468.426750 were a little hesitant on convicting him on some of the charges but i mean when it all came down they just
sw2717A-ms98-a-0073 468.426750 470.164500 within an hour
sw2717A-ms98-a-0074 470.164500 471.981375 decided the man's fate
sw2717A-ms98-a-0075 471.981375 491.419875 [silence]
sw2717A-ms98-a-0076 491.419875 492.538125 yeah

sw2717A-ms98-a-0078 501.971750 505.688125 yeah well it it it went pretty pretty quick from what he said
sw2717A-ms98-a-0079 505.688125 515.485750 but i mean there's there's there's a lot of other crimes out there i mean besides murder i think uh now if you're dealing drugs now caught more than twice or something
sw2717A-ms98-a-0080 515.485750 519.198500 uh it there's uh a death penalty associated with it
sw2717A-ms98-a-0081 519.198500 541.650500 [silence]
sw2717A-ms98-a-0082 541.650500 542.668125 uh-huh

sw2717A-ms98-a-0087 572.328375 580.339000 and uh as far as uh you know there are some some other crimes that i think uh you know
sw2717A-ms98-a-0088 580.339000 581.435250 [noise] [vocalized-noise]
sw2717A-ms98-a-0089 581.435250 585.045000 kidnapping um you know when they
sw2717A-ms98-a-0090 585.045000 588.352250 i mean kidnapping per se has a certain uh
sw2717A-ms98-a-0091 588.352250 589.612000 uh
sw2717A-ms98-a-0092 589.612000 592.758750 fine and penalty associated with it but
sw2717A-ms98-a-0093 592.758750 598.979750 um some of these people are just out and out brutal i some of the cases i've heard about over the years
