sw2782B-ms98-a-0039 139.350000 153.432875 well we've been married for five and a half years and we started out without kids of course and found it much easier to save and used to do a lot more [noise] fun kinds of [laughter-things] that uh didn't really um
sw2782B-ms98-a-0040 153.432875 162.195625 [noise] you know have a real strict budg[et]- but budget but uh the the about into our wh[en]- wh[en]- wh[en]- when we first got married we were in graduate school and we were just you know dirt poor
sw2782B-ms98-a-0041 162.195625 172.842500 then when we got our first jobs after about a year of marriage we decided we'd bank my salary so we could buy a house so we virtually did that for about two years which worked real well
sw2782B-ms98-a-0042 172.842500 178.426250 and then moved from California where we realized we could never buy a [laughter-house] [laughter-anyway] [laughter-no] [laughter-matter] [laughter-how] [laughter-much] [laughter-we] [laughter-saved]
sw2782B-ms98-a-0043 178.426250 189.590000 and moved to Texas and bought a house immediately you know which of course is now devalued with the housing market so i don't know if we [laughter] we did a good thing to buy a house or not but at least we've got a place to live
sw2782B-ms98-a-0044 189.590000 195.143875 um so now since uh we have a three year old and a two year old now um
sw2782B-ms98-a-0045 195.143875 196.387875 uh-huh [laughter]
sw2782B-ms98-a-0046 196.387875 200.673500 that's that that threw our budget [laughter-really] [laughter-out] [laughter-of] [laughter-out] [laughter-of] [laughter-whack] [laughter-too]
sw2782B-ms98-a-0047 200.673500 210.163750 and we um have been just forced to budget much more because i quit working to be home with the kids and um we just really have uh
sw2782B-ms98-a-0048 210.163750 218.336250 [noise] uh i don't know we've we've tried different times we've done like a survey of like taking you know the past three months of where all the money went
sw2782B-ms98-a-0049 218.336250 225.533750 and we really don't spend on anything much of a luxury or anything at all but it seems like there's um
sw2782B-ms98-a-0050 225.533750 234.276125 times when we just have to get out where we'll go and like get a babysitter and we'll go and we'll blow you know fifty sixty dollars in one night going out to eat going to a show or doing something you know
sw2782B-ms98-a-0051 234.276125 237.734250 [silence]
sw2782B-ms98-a-0052 237.734250 250.601250 yeah that's the hard part because_1 when we sit down to make it we try to make it real spartan and real narrow so we can put certain amount in savings every week and then it's not really that realistic because we do find that we want to go and do something or
sw2782B-ms98-a-0053 250.601250 263.862000 splurge for you know birthday for somebody or you know even we we even do things real frugally for the kids we get a lot of toys and clothes and stuff at garage sales or from friends because_1 they don't know the difference at this age you know whether they're Jordache new or whether [laughter-they're] 
sw2782B-ms98-a-0054 263.862000 269.724000 you know [laughter-something] and they're both boys so they just fit one year after the other into each other's clothes so
sw2782B-ms98-a-0055 269.724000 279.544125 but um that's the hardest part for us is that it's really um you know budgeting and some extra things you know for that are more you know nonessential items
sw2782B-ms98-a-0056 279.544125 287.108625 [silence]
sw2782B-ms98-a-0057 287.108625 288.516500 um-hum

sw2782B-ms98-a-0061 302.298250 306.133500 [silence]
sw2782B-ms98-a-0062 306.133500 320.594250 on your [laughter-friends] that's true [laughter] that's true [laughter] well we have so many unexpected things come up so often it seems with we both have older cars and something will come up and we'll end up having to spend a thousand dollars you know on the car in two months or something and
sw2782B-ms98-a-0063 320.594250 325.791375 you know a lot of things like that that really i[s]- are hard to plan for and uh
sw2782B-ms98-a-0064 325.791375 327.398625 [silence]
sw2782B-ms98-a-0065 327.398625 333.721750 yeah kind of put in a certain amount per year you're going to have on extra expenses for car and
sw2782B-ms98-a-0066 333.721750 336.141625 yeah yeah
sw2782B-ms98-a-0067 336.141625 339.503750 [silence]
sw2782B-ms98-a-0068 339.503750 353.014625 yeah [laughter] our biggest way of saving money is then just have all these deductions um you know i[sn't]- isn't let's see now i forget which way we do it we don't list all the deductions and then we get more money back you know at the end of the year
sw2782B-ms98-a-0069 353.014625 356.493625 so that's not a good [laughter-way] [laughter-of] [laughter-doing] [laughter-it]
sw2782B-ms98-a-0070 356.493625 366.518250 that's what my husband said so this last year he changed it then of course we didn't get hardly i mean nearly as much back and it was like oh no we better find another way of saving money [laughter] 
sw2782B-ms98-a-0071 366.518250 368.879875 [silence]
sw2782B-ms98-a-0072 368.879875 370.599625 yeah

sw2782B-ms98-a-0075 381.548250 386.844000 yeah because we don't miss it we really don't when it's just taking out of the paycheck and stuff so
sw2782B-ms98-a-0076 386.844000 396.414625 but we're trying to put a little money away for the kids because we can en[vision]- envision the uh expenses for college already you know [laughter-eighteen] [laughter-years] [laughter-away] [laughter-or] [laughter-whatever]
sw2782B-ms98-a-0077 396.414625 412.949625 [silence]
