sw2782A-ms98-a-0003 3.611500 17.399875 uh i want to talk about um our family budget and the times that it's worked and the times that it hasn't worked and give you a general description of it and you can help me out a little bit

sw2782A-ms98-a-0005 19.618125 20.161125 [noise]
sw2782A-ms98-a-0006 20.161125 29.220125 well at the my i introduced you a little bit to it a few minutes ago when i said that we are uh we're on the east coast now
sw2782A-ms98-a-0007 29.220125 37.576250 my husband quit a perfectly wonderful job and decided that well we both decided we wanted to move to North Carolina
sw2782A-ms98-a-0008 37.576250 42.418000 and so naturally we put ourselves we looked at our budget
sw2782A-ms98-a-0009 42.418000 51.343125 and so what we did was draw up a budget that we thought uh was realistic and uh
sw2782A-ms98-a-0010 51.343125 64.571625 so we had to make some adjustments because we really are kind of looking for something that we want to do uh he wants to do that's satisfactory and we've been here seven months and he's still hasn't hit up on anything permanently
sw2782A-ms98-a-0011 64.571625 67.223250 [laughter] so you see
sw2782A-ms98-a-0012 67.223250 73.369625 well we actually planned for about one year
sw2782A-ms98-a-0013 73.369625 77.834625 uh thank God because it never occurred [laughter]
sw2782A-ms98-a-0014 77.834625 82.223875 [laughter] it never occurred to us that it would take seven months
sw2782A-ms98-a-0015 82.223875 90.007500 and uh what we did was just uh decide wh[at]- how we had been spending our money before
sw2782A-ms98-a-0016 90.007500 103.260000 and then we put that on the computer and then we took about three months and uh and adjusted where we could come down and where we didn't want to come down
sw2782A-ms98-a-0017 103.260000 112.010375 and we really uh lessened it uh our living expenses uh more than what we thought we would [vocalized-noise]
sw2782A-ms98-a-0018 112.010375 113.658000 but
sw2782A-ms98-a-0019 113.658000 116.589875 [silence]
sw2782A-ms98-a-0020 116.589875 120.011375 oh just our own design uh-huh
sw2782A-ms98-a-0021 120.011375 130.564500 and uh so but we've had budgets that didn't work when our uh you know of our first fifteen years or eighteen years of being married nothing [laughter-worked]
sw2782A-ms98-a-0022 130.564500 135.691875 we spent too much money until our k[ids]- children went to college so
sw2782A-ms98-a-0023 135.691875 140.171500 so tell me about do you all uh have a budget
sw2782A-ms98-a-0024 140.171500 170.878500 [silence]

sw2782A-ms98-a-0033 233.417500 239.678375 well i think that's important for your budget to be realist[ically]- for it to work though you have to do something
sw2782A-ms98-a-0034 239.678375 263.600375 [silence]
sw2782A-ms98-a-0035 263.600375 265.258625 of course not
sw2782A-ms98-a-0036 265.258625 279.077750 [silence]
sw2782A-ms98-a-0037 279.077750 288.044500 well i found uh that in the place that it was harder for me to stick to a budget was not where we were concerned
sw2782A-ms98-a-0038 288.044500 294.125250 but where maybe our friends were concerned and our relatives and parents
sw2782A-ms98-a-0039 294.125250 301.533875 uh we we tended to want to keep on giving lavish gifts as we had done before
sw2782A-ms98-a-0040 301.533875 310.943125 and i really believe that if you're going to cut down on yourself you need to cut down [laughter-somewhat] [laughter-on] [laughter-your] [laughter-friends]
sw2782A-ms98-a-0041 310.943125 319.747000 [silence]

sw2782A-ms98-a-0046 329.792500 331.360000 yes
sw2782A-ms98-a-0047 331.360000 334.955250 exactly or know so much per month anyway
sw2782A-ms98-a-0048 334.955250 342.429625 and uh that really should be in your b[ank]- but if you don't spend it it should be in your bank account at the end of the [laughter-month] [laughter]
sw2782A-ms98-a-0049 342.429625 352.516875 [silence]

sw2782A-ms98-a-0052 364.757375 372.453625 well uh but i do realize that that is realistic for some people and it was for us many year[s]- for many years
sw2782A-ms98-a-0053 372.453625 382.781750 uh and if and if that's the only way that will it will make you save and have a little nest egg at the end of the the year then doggone it that's what you should do
sw2782A-ms98-a-0054 382.781750 385.888125 [silence]
