sw2772B-ms98-a-0004 15.515125 19.155750 and Monterey sits um right on the coast
sw2772B-ms98-a-0005 19.155750 27.550875 and i don't know if your familiar with the um the California coastline but we're we're about two hours about a two hour drive south of San Francisco
sw2772B-ms98-a-0006 27.550875 38.532875 and it's uh really nice uh it's a big area for people to come from the different uh countries mostly like Japan and Germany and England and they usually go to Carmel
sw2772B-ms98-a-0007 38.532875 52.637750 and vacation on the beaches so it's it's pretty nice uh year round but um cool always cool in the evenings and uh warm in the warm in the summer but it's stays pretty cool even even uh during the winter for as nice as it is 
sw2772B-ms98-a-0008 52.637750 61.067250 and um we usually get a fog uh right about oh i guess about four o'clock and it kind of rolls in over the coast
sw2772B-ms98-a-0009 61.067250 71.323625 and uh then it usually breaks back off again uh the next morning and if you go just a little bit ways in i'd i'd say about a fifteen minute drive in towards Salinas
sw2772B-ms98-a-0010 71.323625 84.860250 uh it the weather completely changes and it gets very hot and dry and uh the fog never makes it that far but along here it's uh very [laughter] very uh different from the the Texas type uh weather 
sw2772B-ms98-a-0011 84.860250 86.730750 so what's it like down there

sw2772B-ms98-a-0042 176.676375 187.047375 well that's real nice because i can remember um two years ago that in about February the hundred degree weather started in San Antonio and just continued
sw2772B-ms98-a-0043 187.047375 191.606750 so at least y'all are getting some rain up in Dallas i'm glad to hear that [laughter]

sw2772B-ms98-a-0054 214.142000 223.549625 oh [laughter] yeah i really don't miss all the heat here it's i'm getting acclimated to having the cool evenings so we get a bit of a relief
sw2772B-ms98-a-0055 223.549625 227.316250 [silence]
sw2772B-ms98-a-0056 227.316250 229.675750 uh-huh yeah

sw2772B-ms98-a-0059 238.553125 241.749250 oh is that what Dallas is okay yeah
sw2772B-ms98-a-0060 241.749250 248.050625 [silence]
sw2772B-ms98-a-0061 248.050625 249.268625 uh-huh
sw2772B-ms98-a-0062 249.268625 254.142125 [silence]
sw2772B-ms98-a-0063 254.142125 264.774750 um-hum yeah San Antonio has that same problem when the rains come it's compl[ete]- it's a complete mess everything floods all the under passes so i didn't realize that Dallas had that same problem 
sw2772B-ms98-a-0064 264.774750 274.160750 [silence]
sw2772B-ms98-a-0065 274.160750 280.612750 huh golly well we could use some rain up here we're like in the bottom of the fourth year of drought
sw2772B-ms98-a-0066 280.612750 290.242250 up here and they they had a pretty good early spring and we got quite a bit of rain but it wasn't enough to offset what they had lost over the past four years 
sw2772B-ms98-a-0067 290.242250 293.696500 and uh so they're still talking water rationing this summer
sw2772B-ms98-a-0068 293.696500 302.346750 so uh it would seem strange because in San Antonio um we had lived out um west of San Antonio in Castroville
sw2772B-ms98-a-0069 302.346750 308.805750 and the water in Medina Lake and that area was really going down and they were considering um
sw2772B-ms98-a-0070 308.805750 320.997125 that they might have to do water rationing and then i thought oh gee i'm so glad to get out of there and get up here to the the California Pacific coast where it rains and everything has flowers and there's no problem with water and then i came here and found out they were in
sw2772B-ms98-a-0071 320.997125 329.737750 you know in the four year [laughter-drought] so i said well gee this is pretty much like Texas and it pretty much is in the middle of the summer they have rolling hills around here but 
sw2772B-ms98-a-0072 329.737750 336.960500 um they they turn to to golden dead grass for the majority of the summer just because there is no water to keep them green 
sw2772B-ms98-a-0073 336.960500 340.533375 but um it's a really nice area uh
sw2772B-ms98-a-0074 340.533375 352.529500 it's just it's just such a change uh from Texas because i had grown up with uh the heat and and was used to essentially like you said yeah you have the cold winter and then you have the hot 
sw2772B-ms98-a-0075 352.529500 364.459750 summer spring [laughter] and uh to come here it's kind of the the temperate weather all year round it's kind of like um spring i guess if you uh year round
sw2772B-ms98-a-0076 364.459750 378.715750 except and then in the the winter and then it seems [vocalized-noise] sort of like a San Antonio um early winter or fall year round so it seems like we only have two springs which is or two seasons and that would be spring and fall and we never really get any of the other ones 
sw2772B-ms98-a-0077 378.715750 382.706125 but it is it's a really nice uh change of pace
sw2772B-ms98-a-0078 382.706125 391.986875 [laughter] yeah to the to the heat i really don't miss the heat um we do a lot of you know when you do a lot of outside like running and stuff out
sw2772B-ms98-a-0079 391.986875 397.962125 it's just so much easier up here and you don't have to worry about the h[igh]- high humidity does Dallas get high humidity
sw2772B-ms98-a-0080 397.962125 399.634000 or is it pretty dry
sw2772B-ms98-a-0081 399.634000 406.984250 [silence]
sw2772B-ms98-a-0082 406.984250 408.185750 uh-huh
sw2772B-ms98-a-0083 408.185750 411.485875 [silence]
sw2772B-ms98-a-0084 411.485875 418.132875 yeah it seems like San Antonio has been increasing in humidity over the years because i had lived in San Antonio for about twenty years
sw2772B-ms98-a-0085 418.132875 432.005125 and it just seemed like every year it just got a little more humid a little more [laughter-humid] and here it's uh well it's right by the ocean but um it's not the same as at Corpus -[a]t Corpus you you get that humid salty
sw2772B-ms98-a-0086 432.005125 444.406500 feeling in the air but here um the well the water is extremely cold up here you can lay on the beach all you want but um to go if you want to go wind suffering or diving or swimming you have to wear a wet suit 
sw2772B-ms98-a-0087 444.406500 453.099125 and a thick wet suit at that because it's just extremely cold and i for some reason i guess it's because of that cold uh ocean
sw2772B-ms98-a-0088 453.099125 461.121250 uh water that the the air is always cool it's never humid or sticky or salty feeling so i really like that about this area 
sw2772B-ms98-a-0089 461.121250 471.481875 and uh we just hadn't expected it we were used to what uh uh gulf coast uh weather was like and we came here to Pacific coast weather it's just completely different and it's much nicer
sw2772B-ms98-a-0090 471.481875 472.541625 so
sw2772B-ms98-a-0091 472.541625 474.004625 [silence]
sw2772B-ms98-a-0092 474.004625 487.355500 uh-huh it does and the um the air doesn't feel anything like it does along the gulf coast region but um but we like it so it's a nice change so we'll be here a couple of years and we thought well we'll take advantage of it and and see what all the Pacific coast is like 
sw2772B-ms98-a-0093 487.355500 489.325125 and uh so it's been good
sw2772B-ms98-a-0094 489.325125 494.162000 [silence]
sw2772B-ms98-a-0095 494.162000 498.250000 oh i imagine that Virginia i imagine gets really humid doesn't it
sw2772B-ms98-a-0096 498.250000 502.357375 [silence]
sw2772B-ms98-a-0097 502.357375 503.774375 oh

sw2772B-ms98-a-0102 515.621250 521.745125 uh-huh yeah [laughter] not like Texas where everything comes to a stand still you know uh
sw2772B-ms98-a-0103 521.745125 524.393625 [silence]
sw2772B-ms98-a-0104 524.393625 530.324250 uh-huh oh ye[ah]- i'll have to try that out because_1 i had heard that North Carolina was sort of like that
sw2772B-ms98-a-0105 530.324250 539.497000 and uh i've just never really been in that region of the country and i guess i'm going to have to try that area sometime and see what it's like because a lot of people that are from that [noise] North Carolina region really like it
sw2772B-ms98-a-0106 539.497000 545.062500 and uh they like they get the snow but they said it doesn't really get messy and it doesn't really hang around that long and
sw2772B-ms98-a-0107 545.062500 548.800750 uh they th[e]- the people i know that are from there [vocalized-noise] uh 
sw2772B-ms98-a-0108 548.800750 555.872625 they always miss it and they want to go back [laughter] nothing seems quite as good yeah but anyway 
sw2772B-ms98-a-0109 555.872625 556.954125 well
sw2772B-ms98-a-0110 556.954125 560.356875 [silence]

sw2772B-ms98-a-0114 568.565875 571.785125 [laughter] yeah because_1 we could sure use it
sw2772B-ms98-a-0115 571.785125 576.698000 okay well you think that takes care of the the time and
