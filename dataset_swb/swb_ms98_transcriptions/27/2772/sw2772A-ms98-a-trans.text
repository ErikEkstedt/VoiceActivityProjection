sw2772A-ms98-a-0046 231.317750 238.824875 the the biggest problem with with the with the weather and the rain in this area is the the soil it's that black clay soil
sw2772A-ms98-a-0047 238.824875 240.715750 [silence]
sw2772A-ms98-a-0048 240.715750 247.170750 it's kind of s[andy]- you know it's not sandy like most of the state is so it doesn't absorb
sw2772A-ms98-a-0049 247.170750 251.095000 the water real well i mean once it rains a little bit it's
sw2772A-ms98-a-0050 251.095000 255.388000 it's filled up and everything else just runs off so
