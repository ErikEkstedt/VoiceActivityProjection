sw2714B-ms98-a-0015 60.073500 69.759000 and i our local school district is going to have to fire all it's teacher aides to balance the budget so i things are tough all over
sw2714B-ms98-a-0016 69.759000 70.940875 [silence]

sw2714B-ms98-a-0019 79.940375 83.702125 oh prop thirteen is the one that uh
sw2714B-ms98-a-0020 83.702125 92.336875 limits the amount that uh real estate taxes can rise every year property taxes can only go up a certain
sw2714B-ms98-a-0021 92.336875 99.450000 amount per year uh until the house is sold or [noise] the person dies and then it's reevaluated

sw2714B-ms98-a-0027 139.054500 152.473875 well that's certainly true we can get hit uh a lot of corporations at least seem to get blindsided by taxes that are sometimes even retroactive which i would have thought was then unconstitutional [noise] but doesn't turn out to be
sw2714B-ms98-a-0028 152.473875 165.438250 [silence]
sw2714B-ms98-a-0029 165.438250 167.397750 right [noise]

sw2714B-ms98-a-0031 168.786250 177.753125 [laughter] [laughter-no] it's i don't know where some of these things come from but they look like they're from out in left field to me 
sw2714B-ms98-a-0032 177.753125 190.366625 i don't know what we're going to do long range to solve the budgeting problem but there certainly has been proposals why are are you aware of the Grace Commission proposals from a few years back
sw2714B-ms98-a-0033 190.366625 191.450375 [silence]
sw2714B-ms98-a-0034 191.450375 203.868875 well the WR Grace uh was put in charge of a commission to find government waste uh i guess this is about eight or ten years ago now and he came out with a whole book 
sw2714B-ms98-a-0035 203.868875 216.150250 of his group i mean it has his name but he was just the administrator of it of places where things like government purchasing could be rationalized where uh
sw2714B-ms98-a-0036 216.150250 230.458875 renting of space could be made much more efficient where a lot of the accounting is just you know incredibly Byzantine and could be straightened out and where lots of different government activities are redundant
sw2714B-ms98-a-0037 230.458875 242.117000 and where and there are billions of dollars in every years budget that are just totally wasted because nobody is running the government as if it were a business
sw2714B-ms98-a-0038 242.117000 243.174500 [silence]
sw2714B-ms98-a-0039 243.174500 244.146250 and

sw2714B-ms98-a-0041 245.288250 252.082750 uh we we couldn't afford to do that sort of thing we can't we don't have money to throw around personally
sw2714B-ms98-a-0042 252.082750 255.057250 [silence]
sw2714B-ms98-a-0043 255.057250 256.440500 uh-hum
sw2714B-ms98-a-0044 256.440500 261.844125 [silence]
sw2714B-ms98-a-0045 261.844125 271.554000 it has no incentive to hold back on expenses uh i happened many years ago to work for a state government for a while and
sw2714B-ms98-a-0046 271.554000 282.643625 it absolutely boggled my mind the way they budgeted because there was no uh an attempt to figure out what it really should cost to do what we should be doing
sw2714B-ms98-a-0047 282.643625 293.604875 it was just take last year's budget add X percentage ask for that and if you hadn't spent all your money by December run out and buy something quick so that you
sw2714B-ms98-a-0048 293.604875 295.434125 [silence]
sw2714B-ms98-a-0049 295.434125 306.376125 that's right i can remember uh the entire office got new electric typewriters because we hadn't spent all our budget money in December that was just crazy
sw2714B-ms98-a-0050 306.376125 315.604875 [silence]
sw2714B-ms98-a-0051 315.604875 316.977375 that's right
sw2714B-ms98-a-0052 316.977375 318.625750 [silence]
sw2714B-ms98-a-0053 318.625750 327.970000 we might come up short next year if we haven't spent everything this year and so no matter how foolish the expenditure be sure we get rid of that money
sw2714B-ms98-a-0054 327.970000 336.622875 [silence]
sw2714B-ms98-a-0055 336.622875 338.428500 absolutely
sw2714B-ms98-a-0056 338.428500 341.016000 [silence]
sw2714B-ms98-a-0057 341.016000 352.453750 i think uh probably if you just looked at congressional budgets the amount they waste on frivolous things uh with congressional office staff is
sw2714B-ms98-a-0058 352.453750 367.139125 again mind boggling you read about what it costs the new uh house whip or uh the uh Speaker of the House to redecorate and my God those offices were just redecorated a few years ago
sw2714B-ms98-a-0059 367.139125 374.906500 they it they spent hundreds of thousands of dollars they're spending twenty five thousand dollars just this year
sw2714B-ms98-a-0060 374.906500 384.121750 for a feasibility study to determine whether they should build a second gym at the capitol for the staffs of the Congress
sw2714B-ms98-a-0061 384.121750 385.348750 [silence]
sw2714B-ms98-a-0062 385.348750 390.352000 well that's that's not to build one stick that's just [laughter]
sw2714B-ms98-a-0063 390.352000 405.257750 [laughter-well] [laughter-it] that's the kind of thing that makes me mad i want to vote the whole batch of them out of office if that's the way they think they should spend our money and just because it's a few hundred thousand here
sw2714B-ms98-a-0064 405.257750 410.955625 who was it said a a billion here a billion there pretty soon we're talking about real money
sw2714B-ms98-a-0065 410.955625 412.634500 [silence]
sw2714B-ms98-a-0066 412.634500 416.381750 i think that was old Everett Dirtyson or somebody [vocalized-noise]

sw2714B-ms98-a-0071 439.185625 440.514500 [silence]
sw2714B-ms98-a-0072 440.514500 451.598000 and when we're talking about adding that much to a budget where it's just already in the hole just the think about the amount of interest we'll be paying on that we'll probably more than double it
sw2714B-ms98-a-0073 451.598000 461.623500 [silence]
sw2714B-ms98-a-0074 461.623500 463.178625 um

sw2714B-ms98-a-0083 496.512125 512.753125 [silence]
sw2714B-ms98-a-0084 512.753125 519.089625 [noise] yeah we did that this year too California just passed that in the last election [noise]

sw2714B-ms98-a-0091 536.303375 549.600875 yeah what's funny is that everybody says they want to throw out the rascals but nobody wants to throw out his own rascal [laughter] otherwise we wouldn't have ninety eight percent of the incumbents reelected
sw2714B-ms98-a-0092 549.600875 551.119875 [silence]
sw2714B-ms98-a-0093 551.119875 554.979375 yes i'm an editor at a think tank

sw2714B-ms98-a-0096 565.012000 574.480250 and i do my small bit to help in uh at least express themselves coherently even if i don't always agree with what they're expressing
sw2714B-ms98-a-0097 574.480250 576.878250 [laughter]
sw2714B-ms98-a-0098 576.878250 581.679625 [silence]
sw2714B-ms98-a-0099 581.679625 589.109875 well we've got some really really interesting people we get fifty different fellows every year from all around the world
sw2714B-ms98-a-0100 589.109875 599.624000 and uh so we get just the year of intense interaction with these people and sometimes we really hate to see them go we'd like to keep them for years and years and lots of times we're not so
