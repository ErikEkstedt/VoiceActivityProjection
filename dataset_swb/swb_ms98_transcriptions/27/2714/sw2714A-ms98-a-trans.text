sw2714A-ms98-a-0007 14.209500 17.386375 but we're talking about a national topic anyway

sw2714A-ms98-a-0010 24.495500 35.246500 that's the truth and i know that we've we've just come off a national high with the Middle East but now we're facing the same old problems that we had before and that is balancing the budget
sw2714A-ms98-a-0011 35.246500 42.499500 i don't know how California's budget is but North Carolina's state budget is uh disastrous right now too

sw2714A-ms98-a-0017 68.630625 71.474625 oh California has always been a leader
sw2714A-ms98-a-0018 71.474625 74.805125 [laughter]
sw2714A-ms98-a-0019 74.805125 80.219625 oh now what was the proposition number several years ago that you voted on for
sw2714A-ms98-a-0020 80.219625 81.367375 [silence]
sw2714A-ms98-a-0021 81.367375 82.547375 yes

sw2714A-ms98-a-0025 99.192750 110.584875 yeah that that i think was a a smart move i don't know how it's worked out but it it seemed very logical in fact it raises one of the issues that i've thought about the national budget
sw2714A-ms98-a-0026 110.584875 120.376250 the budget relates to all of us and so does the tax law which usually is an offshoot of the budget process i've often thought
sw2714A-ms98-a-0027 120.376250 129.953375 that Congress ought not to be allowed to pass any new tax laws say every four or five years instead of every year
sw2714A-ms98-a-0028 129.953375 139.727125 an individual has no opportunity individual or corporation or any other business entity has no opportunity to plan long range

sw2714A-ms98-a-0034 150.216000 151.849500 right
sw2714A-ms98-a-0035 151.849500 163.809375 uh that's another thing too i've often often wondered seemed to be when i was growing up i learned in Civics or Government that uh the House of Representatives has to initiate all
sw2714A-ms98-a-0036 163.809375 166.188750 tax bills
sw2714A-ms98-a-0037 166.188750 171.910375 and i don't think it's working that way [laughter-Kathleen]

sw2714A-ms98-a-0053 250.962625 262.509000 no and when you're not responsible and that's really what it comes down to because you know it a government uh agency really doesn't care about what the postage rate is
sw2714A-ms98-a-0054 262.509000 281.932000 [silence]

sw2714A-ms98-a-0061 305.534250 319.363500 and the mentality was and probably rightfully so because the people devising the budget uh didn't go back to a zero based budgeting they just did it on the basis of what they spend five percent increase and uh go on with it
sw2714A-ms98-a-0062 319.363500 326.950250 [silence]
sw2714A-ms98-a-0063 326.950250 341.195625 uh-huh uh-huh and you know grace uh type waste that you mentioned we see often highlighted in the military and the defense department but it's uh i'm sure it's widespread to every agency

sw2714A-ms98-a-0079 414.241875 427.060250 that's sad and people don't realize it we've become sort of blase about the uh amount of money because a billion if if the government paid a dollar a second
sw2714A-ms98-a-0080 427.060250 438.008750 back in the national debt just a dollar a second it would take thirty years to repay a billion dollars now you know that's that's a long time and that's a lot of money
sw2714A-ms98-a-0081 438.008750 440.921000 and when we're talking about trillions

sw2714A-ms98-a-0083 447.741625 450.318625 um have you
sw2714A-ms98-a-0084 450.318625 462.027375 the uh banking crisis is another another case i was reading this week about the FDIC saying that they couldn't take on another large bank failure without going to gove[rnment]- to Congress
sw2714A-ms98-a-0085 462.027375 467.823875 and borrowing and i started thinking now wait a minute they're in exactly the same shape
sw2714A-ms98-a-0086 467.823875 475.894875 uh that they criticized the banks that they're dealing with [vocalized-noise] exactly the same shape but

sw2714A-ms98-a-0093 495.256250 505.988125 i i moved here from Oklahoma i'm originally from Virginia and moved to Oklahoma for twenty years and just moved back to the southeast and Oklahoma just passed uh last year
sw2714A-ms98-a-0094 505.988125 514.095000 a law stating that uh or limiting the terms of the state representatives

sw2714A-ms98-a-0098 517.647125 522.470125 it will be interesting to see if we have any any impetus to go on to the national

sw2714A-ms98-a-0100 523.619875 538.431125 yeah i think so too i i get torn thinking about some of the good people all the people i think are good and having to lose them but on the other hand uh maybe they'll pay more serious attention to the process while they're there instead of the reelection
