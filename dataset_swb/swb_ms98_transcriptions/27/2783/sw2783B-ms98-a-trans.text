sw2783B-ms98-a-0005 13.504750 18.965000 and acts as a terminal for me because i'm a graduate student and i log out of school from there

sw2783B-ms98-a-0007 21.623875 25.890000 i'm a graduate student in psychology yeah i do uh language acquisition work
sw2783B-ms98-a-0008 25.890000 34.121625 but it's it's it's very helpful it's nice to have a machine at home that i can use locally for things like writing and so forth but i don't i don't

sw2783B-ms98-a-0012 40.021125 49.764875 yeah i don't need a printer or anything because i just sort of i can just call school and transfer everything over to school over the phone lines so how about you do you have um a mach[ine]-

sw2783B-ms98-a-0016 64.187875 66.956250 yeah P S two's are general architecture
sw2783B-ms98-a-0017 66.956250 72.587000 they're a little bit dif[ferent]- though um we have two model seventies that we just bought last year and they um
sw2783B-ms98-a-0018 72.587000 82.213250 there are some slight differences between those and other machines i'm finding oh i feel it's fine i actually don't i i haven't actually noticed a major difference between a P S two and everything else actually 
sw2783B-ms98-a-0019 82.213250 95.206750 um you know in in in terms of performing faster or better or anything i'm not actually sure what the major advantage of a P S two over anything else is with the possible exception of the fact that it's got a mouse port built in the back
sw2783B-ms98-a-0020 95.206750 116.734000 [silence]
sw2783B-ms98-a-0021 116.734000 125.731750 yeah yeah i think so um it's it's al[though]- although it's funny because i just i just had a discussion on break on one of our machines because it's just too slow
sw2783B-ms98-a-0022 125.731750 127.021375 we have a decent
sw2783B-ms98-a-0023 127.021375 133.129750 somehow it slipped by us that we had bought one with two meg and of of memor[y]- of of RAM and one with only one
sw2783B-ms98-a-0024 133.129750 136.668375 and we're running this new version of Lotus i don't know if you've ever seen this or not 
sw2783B-ms98-a-0025 136.668375 142.711375 [silence]
sw2783B-ms98-a-0026 142.711375 154.664250 yeah oh tha[t's]- that's true actually i um i found [vocalized-noise] that this particular version three of Lotus one two three actually i think performs maybe even in the high ninety per cent of what i'm expecting at this point i'm i am 
sw2783B-ms98-a-0027 154.664250 158.441000 it's it's it's because i'm new enough at it yet that i haven't figured everything out
sw2783B-ms98-a-0028 158.441000 161.409375 [silence]
sw2783B-ms98-a-0029 161.409375 163.717375 my first exposure was
sw2783B-ms98-a-0030 163.717375 168.391750 i guess when i was an undergraduate um a couple of years ago we had
sw2783B-ms98-a-0031 168.391750 171.432750 they they inundated us with Macintoshes
sw2783B-ms98-a-0032 171.432750 176.626000 they brought a bunch of Macs into uh there must have been some sort of program and they brought Macintoshes in for us to
sw2783B-ms98-a-0033 176.626000 180.754750 for the school to do you know for all the kids in the school to do word processing on and
sw2783B-ms98-a-0034 180.754750 183.156625 [silence]
sw2783B-ms98-a-0035 183.156625 193.294625 no there there never was an undergraduate requirement it just everyone really everyone took to them very quickly because there were a number of them available and they made 
sw2783B-ms98-a-0036 193.294625 202.273375 [silence]
sw2783B-ms98-a-0037 202.273375 211.655625 uh i'm not sure they must have they didn't in my case i was a psych major and they didn't i know that here they're required of some of of um where i am now
sw2783B-ms98-a-0038 211.655625 216.223375 they require it of of actually a number of different uh majors
sw2783B-ms98-a-0039 216.223375 227.392750 you know it's um some psychologists people psychology can take that in lieu of other courses and people in business [vocalized-noise] to uh i think are supposed and people in cognitive science definitely have to um 
sw2783B-ms98-a-0040 227.392750 233.641875 [silence]
sw2783B-ms98-a-0041 233.641875 242.909625 oh yeah i i actually um you said you said you work on mainframes a lot that that's a lot of what i do is on a a Sun i don't know if you work on Suns at all um 
sw2783B-ms98-a-0042 242.909625 248.781375 so Sun Microsystem machine which is another mainframe in a type of a mainframe we do lots of
sw2783B-ms98-a-0043 248.781375 253.180250 um sort of brain you know neural network modeling
sw2783B-ms98-a-0044 253.180250 263.395250 on on on a on a lot of mainframe machines so yeah this is been a lot of expanding and having to be able to have things at home and and to study the interaction too has been wonderful
sw2783B-ms98-a-0045 263.395250 272.140375 [silence]
sw2783B-ms98-a-0046 272.140375 273.359750 wow

sw2783B-ms98-a-0054 303.657500 308.198875 i mean the the the notion of personal computer back then meant you had to have your own living room
sw2783B-ms98-a-0055 308.198875 326.701000 [silence]
sw2783B-ms98-a-0056 326.701000 329.873125 wow so this is the perfect topic for you um

sw2783B-ms98-a-0062 371.957250 385.056500 well how do they compare with like um you know the the big um the big you know the the ones that that that took up a whole room in the sixties i mean how would you you know power wise was that less well actually less powerful than 
sw2783B-ms98-a-0063 385.056500 397.844375 [silence]
sw2783B-ms98-a-0064 397.844375 400.237375 oh God really
sw2783B-ms98-a-0065 400.237375 404.873750 tha[t]- that much and and and that much bigger too for the same analogy wow

sw2783B-ms98-a-0076 465.720500 469.487125 right and they'll and they'll say [vocalized-noise] imagine those big clunkers those 
sw2783B-ms98-a-0077 469.487125 472.436500 of big laptop computers way back when 
sw2783B-ms98-a-0078 472.436500 480.829000 [silence]
sw2783B-ms98-a-0079 480.829000 481.969125 does it
sw2783B-ms98-a-0080 481.969125 483.984000 yeah there's there's
sw2783B-ms98-a-0081 483.984000 486.427875 going to say there's a big move for that
sw2783B-ms98-a-0082 486.427875 490.833250 my uh my my sister-in-law is a principal of a school
sw2783B-ms98-a-0083 490.833250 499.903125 and she just switched but before she was in a um a in a in a a a different school and she wrote a grant with i think it was Apple or IBM one of the two 
sw2783B-ms98-a-0084 499.903125 510.476375 i'm pretty sure it was Apple actually to uh to get a whole bunch of you know PCs into or PC type machines into the school for the kids to use and and it just 
sw2783B-ms98-a-0085 510.476375 517.606125 according to her it's just a wonderful thing kids go in and are able to work at their own pace and you know computers aren't impatient
sw2783B-ms98-a-0086 517.606125 521.816250 they'll sit there and wait forever if the kid doesn't want to answer for awhile or it'll um 
sw2783B-ms98-a-0087 521.816250 532.862125 it'll you know the kids for those kids who really have a problem working with faster than the class or slower than the class it lets them go and what she's finding now is that in evenings the parents will come in and do it too
