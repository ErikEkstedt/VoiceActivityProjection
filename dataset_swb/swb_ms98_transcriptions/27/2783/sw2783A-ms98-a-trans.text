sw2783A-ms98-a-0011 32.555625 35.917750 oh it it's uh ideal for that
sw2783A-ms98-a-0012 35.917750 39.826625 word processing part is is extremely useful i think

sw2783A-ms98-a-0019 53.713000 61.640000 been used to working and this is my first years but all of the work that i do is plus getting to know it a little bit better 
sw2783A-ms98-a-0020 61.640000 64.284125 they're powerful little rascals

sw2783A-ms98-a-0028 94.088750 101.122625 yeah [laughter] i'd i've noticed uh there was some scattered at work and i notice the uh 
sw2783A-ms98-a-0029 101.122625 112.621750 through put is much faster on mine than than those but i think it's just because of the the lower level in expectation out of them that the processing speed is much faster
sw2783A-ms98-a-0030 112.621750 116.567125 on uh the same canned programs

sw2783A-ms98-a-0045 178.836375 179.935500 right
sw2783A-ms98-a-0046 179.935500 183.016250 is there an undergraduate requirement on them
sw2783A-ms98-a-0047 183.016250 191.682125 [silence]
sw2783A-ms98-a-0048 191.682125 197.631375 what about all the majors are there any such as business or uh or other
sw2783A-ms98-a-0049 197.631375 201.787000 undergraduate majors do they require it of any of them

sw2783A-ms98-a-0053 226.459250 234.083625 well actually it's expanded your field too because the psychology of of man working with machine is [laughter] is a whole new element that
sw2783A-ms98-a-0054 234.083625 237.327750 [silence]
sw2783A-ms98-a-0055 237.327750 238.477500 uh-huh

sw2783A-ms98-a-0059 263.646125 269.578500 yeah it's interesting i think uh i've i've worked with computers since nineteen 
sw2783A-ms98-a-0060 269.578500 270.834000 [silence]
sw2783A-ms98-a-0061 270.834000 272.295500 sixty
sw2783A-ms98-a-0062 272.295500 275.560750 yeah i'm an old man [laughter]
sw2783A-ms98-a-0063 275.560750 277.026000 [silence]
sw2783A-ms98-a-0064 277.026000 284.270125 no they were the IBM six fifty took up a whole room as a vacuum tube uh machine
sw2783A-ms98-a-0065 284.270125 288.278875 and it was bi[nary]- quinary um base five
sw2783A-ms98-a-0066 288.278875 290.789875 [silence]
sw2783A-ms98-a-0067 290.789875 296.527875 i have no idea [laughter] i didn't never did learn why but it was a base five
sw2783A-ms98-a-0068 296.527875 298.409625 which is very interesting
sw2783A-ms98-a-0069 298.409625 300.742750 [silence]
sw2783A-ms98-a-0070 300.742750 303.964375 oh it's been amazing it really has been
sw2783A-ms98-a-0071 303.964375 307.185000 [silence]
sw2783A-ms98-a-0072 307.185000 315.012125 oh i know it i know it and it's almost like talking about the checkless society and and all of that and you know there was talk
sw2783A-ms98-a-0073 315.012125 324.331250 in fact my brother uh was with IBM from nineteen fifty four until about three years ago so we really had a family history of talking about
sw2783A-ms98-a-0074 324.331250 326.966250 development of uh of equipment
sw2783A-ms98-a-0075 326.966250 328.999125 [silence]
sw2783A-ms98-a-0076 328.999125 331.418250 [laughter-oh] [laughter] 
sw2783A-ms98-a-0077 331.418250 332.676000 you know and
sw2783A-ms98-a-0078 332.676000 339.661250 i do i do some programming of my own too using Cobol rather than any of the newer languages
sw2783A-ms98-a-0079 339.661250 344.884750 it's just one that i've known for a long time and still use it even on this
sw2783A-ms98-a-0080 344.884750 346.658125 PS two
sw2783A-ms98-a-0081 346.658125 349.460125 so i have
sw2783A-ms98-a-0082 349.460125 356.957250 to learn a tolerance with canned programs because i'm so used to being able to do exactly what i want to do rather than having to
sw2783A-ms98-a-0083 356.957250 365.205750 work around or go through two or three different steps to get to the the final one but i am amazed at the power
sw2783A-ms98-a-0084 365.205750 372.137250 and uh ability of these small units that sit on a table or desk
sw2783A-ms98-a-0085 372.137250 383.913000 [silence]
sw2783A-ms98-a-0086 383.913000 386.766375 oh it it was almost uh 
sw2783A-ms98-a-0087 386.766375 388.499000 [silence]
sw2783A-ms98-a-0088 388.499000 389.601125 well
sw2783A-ms98-a-0089 389.601125 390.683375 [silence]
sw2783A-ms98-a-0090 390.683375 392.720875 it's hard to describe
sw2783A-ms98-a-0091 392.720875 398.769625 but it's almost like uh an abacus versus an ele[ctronic]- electronic calculator you know y[ou]-
sw2783A-ms98-a-0092 398.769625 400.846875 you [laughter-go] [laughter] 
sw2783A-ms98-a-0093 400.846875 402.467375 [silence]
sw2783A-ms98-a-0094 402.467375 406.016375 oh yeah but i mean the speed
sw2783A-ms98-a-0095 406.016375 409.430250 using punch cards and
sw2783A-ms98-a-0096 409.430250 416.633000 for your information Ken this first uh first computer had one had two accumulators
sw2783A-ms98-a-0097 416.633000 424.690500 and one focal point that you had to channel everything into it was called a distributor and you moved it from memory
sw2783A-ms98-a-0098 424.690500 429.220375 you had to know exactly where in memory it was there was no relative memory
sw2783A-ms98-a-0099 429.220375 434.542125 and you had to know exactly in memory where it was move it to the distributor
sw2783A-ms98-a-0100 434.542125 443.715625 put it into one of the accumulators and add it take it back out of the distributor and put it somewhere else so it it was as basic as you can get
sw2783A-ms98-a-0101 443.715625 446.923875 and uh of course the speed
sw2783A-ms98-a-0102 446.923875 449.575125 of processing
sw2783A-ms98-a-0103 449.575125 455.034625 was very very slow but compared to anything then it was very very fast
sw2783A-ms98-a-0104 455.034625 458.760500 yeah so it everything is relative [laughter] 
sw2783A-ms98-a-0105 458.760500 465.162875 twenty twenty years from now we'll we'll call up again and and say what do you think of the new uh thought computers 
sw2783A-ms98-a-0106 465.162875 466.960375 [laughter]
sw2783A-ms98-a-0107 466.960375 468.580875 [silence]
sw2783A-ms98-a-0108 468.580875 470.331500 right [laughter]
sw2783A-ms98-a-0109 470.331500 471.726500 [silence]
sw2783A-ms98-a-0110 471.726500 480.382250 yeah but i think they're they're excellent tools for people to learn how to use and i'd like to see them in in grade schools 
sw2783A-ms98-a-0111 480.382250 482.778625 right now i think they are in fact the 
sw2783A-ms98-a-0112 482.778625 485.174875 computer system uh instruction 
sw2783A-ms98-a-0113 485.174875 486.363375 yeah
sw2783A-ms98-a-0114 486.363375 489.860750 [silence]
sw2783A-ms98-a-0115 489.860750 491.121000 uh-huh

sw2783A-ms98-a-0121 531.617750 533.627750 oh yeah yeah
sw2783A-ms98-a-0122 533.627750 540.793500 but it has a lot of home uses too i've i've not i don't have mine hooked up to anything uh
sw2783A-ms98-a-0123 540.793500 543.724000 you know it's just a stand alone but
sw2783A-ms98-a-0124 543.724000 550.931000 the abilities in the future will be networking throughout uh automatic built-in telephone
sw2783A-ms98-a-0125 550.931000 551.338000 [silence]
