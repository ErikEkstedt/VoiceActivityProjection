sw2744A-ms98-a-0046 169.619375 178.254625 have a lot more freedom as far as what they do as far as you know even even something as simple as staying up late
sw2744A-ms98-a-0047 178.254625 188.185750 um watching television late um going out late start dating you start dating too early you know just little things like that that do start in the home
sw2744A-ms98-a-0048 188.185750 194.160375 that can that plays a big part because you spend eight hours of your day or more in school
sw2744A-ms98-a-0049 194.160375 201.872250 and so any other part of your life that's going to definitely affect your school life because you spend so much time there

sw2744A-ms98-a-0064 232.697750 239.902500 i talked to a guy the other day and he is now in in a program that's trying to get him out of high school
sw2744A-ms98-a-0065 239.902500 246.798250 because he he fell back several years ago and he's going to he he will have gone to school five years
sw2744A-ms98-a-0066 246.798250 253.741875 um and the reason that he was doing so badly a couple of years ago was because his mother died
sw2744A-ms98-a-0067 253.741875 264.899625 and he was having to uh support his entire family take care of his brothers and sisters you know and all that had an adverse affect on his school life
sw2744A-ms98-a-0068 264.899625 270.890125 and yeah and that and that's a perfect example of how your home life you know plays a definite part
sw2744A-ms98-a-0069 270.890125 279.282375 and you know any other aspect of your life an but now now that he's in this program and you know he's i guess okay he's he's making straight A's
sw2744A-ms98-a-0070 279.282375 283.759375 and you know it just it it was there it was just
sw2744A-ms98-a-0071 283.759375 288.287000 i guess school was not a number one priority for him at that time

sw2744A-ms98-a-0146 534.918000 546.076500 and i had all these classes and all this knowledge and this big library across the street from my dorm and i just didn't take as much advantage of it as i should have and
sw2744A-ms98-a-0147 546.076500 552.762625 no i went to UT at Austin uh-huh so i mean all kinds of resources and you know just there
sw2744A-ms98-a-0148 552.762625 560.100500 and i'd give anything to have that right now in my in my regular li[fe]- i mean you you have everything given to you i don't see why
