sw2744B-ms98-a-0013 41.982500 47.232750 uh y[eah]- y[eah]- yeah well the r[esults]- the results i i hear what you're
sw2744B-ms98-a-0014 47.232750 49.159500 you're saying about the results
sw2744B-ms98-a-0015 49.159500 50.878875 [vocalized-noise]
sw2744B-ms98-a-0016 50.878875 53.422500 and uh uh it's
sw2744B-ms98-a-0017 53.422500 61.349875 what to do about it i guess is the the big thing i'm i'm in a kind of an interesting situation in that my my wife teaches school here in Plano
sw2744B-ms98-a-0018 61.349875 69.227875 and i know that uh the results that they get out of the system sometime i[s]- is is certainly not
sw2744B-ms98-a-0019 69.227875 76.106875 [noise] -[be]cau[se]- you know up to what the effort they put into it you know i've seen that for years yeah

sw2744B-ms98-a-0023 86.726750 91.366500 yeah i've often wondered if it doesn't come back to the the home environment
sw2744B-ms98-a-0024 91.366500 95.491250 and uh it if uh [laughter]
sw2744B-ms98-a-0025 95.491250 103.213000 no matter what they do in the in the classroom if they go home at night and you know it's all totally undone uh
sw2744B-ms98-a-0026 103.213000 112.312500 the the thing that uh uh that Karen my wife has has run into so often is that you run into a group of kids that are going to succeed
sw2744B-ms98-a-0027 112.312500 121.175125 no matter what no matter how bad their teachers are no matter what a lousy system they're in or anything else these people somehow manage to uh
sw2744B-ms98-a-0028 121.175125 124.633500 you know push on through and are successful
sw2744B-ms98-a-0029 124.633500 131.328125 it's uh unfortunately probably what maybe twenty five or thirty percent of them_1 do that
sw2744B-ms98-a-0030 131.328125 136.416000 well ye[ah]- that would be that'd be at the absolute most and uh
sw2744B-ms98-a-0031 136.416000 142.191375 you know th[ose]- those that you know come out you know fall out of the system that are
sw2744B-ms98-a-0032 142.191375 147.268250 are real trouble i i wonder whether that's just a uh
sw2744B-ms98-a-0033 147.268250 158.061625 uh a part of the system you know if you know in a democracy where you know people have kind of uh a freedom to sort of do what they want you know there['s]- there's an inefficiency there
sw2744B-ms98-a-0034 158.061625 161.588625 and you've got to let those you know those y[ou]- y[ou]-

sw2744B-ms98-a-0051 201.109375 207.301000 and sometimes in some systems they make everything so competitive you know you from the minute that you walk in until you
sw2744B-ms98-a-0052 207.301000 215.845250 until you leave you're you're competing against somebody else or you're competing against uh a system or or something you know and then
sw2744B-ms98-a-0053 215.845250 223.475500 a lot of the[re]- there is a personality type i believe that is really non competitive they're cooperative rather than competitive
sw2744B-ms98-a-0054 223.475500 228.735125 and when they get into a real competitive system they just say oh well what the heck and uh
sw2744B-ms98-a-0055 228.735125 230.614250 tend not to
sw2744B-ms98-a-0056 230.614250 234.241750 you know do too awful well [vocalized-noise]

sw2744B-ms98-a-0071 286.401500 296.185250 yeah it uh right survival becomes more of a priority than than than education and unfortunately you know [laughter-there's] [laughter-uh] there's and old joke about uh
sw2744B-ms98-a-0072 296.185250 304.816125 you know education's wasted on the youth anyway you don't you don't really appreciate it until you're much older anyway i know when i went to school
sw2744B-ms98-a-0073 304.816125 316.876625 uh my attitude was kind of one of you know these people are you know taking a tremendous amount of my time you know and i've got better things to be doing than sitting here listening to this stuff over and over again
sw2744B-ms98-a-0074 316.876625 324.559625 i guess today that would be uh somehow or rather there would be a program of some sort that would take care of that sort of thing but
sw2744B-ms98-a-0075 324.559625 330.469625 the uh the cure[s]- some of the cures that i've heard for this that that sort of make sense uh
sw2744B-ms98-a-0076 330.469625 338.975750 most teachers after they've taught for a very long especially at the the lower grades can spot a problem almost immediately
sw2744B-ms98-a-0077 338.975750 349.763125 and uh it's kind of these intervention programs now a lot of people will get to looking at these and say hey that's socialism and that's communism and that's you know and then it gets political
sw2744B-ms98-a-0078 349.763125 352.126000 but uh [noise] boy yeah

sw2744B-ms98-a-0088 374.386250 383.493375 well you know the the radical programs in some cases are just totally unacceptable there are kids families that should just simply be taken out of the homes
sw2744B-ms98-a-0089 383.493375 386.623625 you know and uh uh
sw2744B-ms98-a-0090 386.623625 393.675500 you know uh just removed from those situations or they're never going to get anywhere but yet politically that is not a very popular
sw2744B-ms98-a-0091 393.675500 404.593000 view i'm sure that if you you know ran on a platform of you know we're going to find the kids that are having trouble at home and we're going to take them_1 out of the home and all yeah you know how far you're going to get with that
sw2744B-ms98-a-0092 404.593000 414.241375 uh but unfortunately it's it's something like that in lieu of that you know is the intervention programs in school where the these kids are are spotted
sw2744B-ms98-a-0093 414.241375 418.656125 fairly early on and uh you know there's
sw2744B-ms98-a-0094 418.656125 426.953750 well [noise] that's get to be a problem in Texas you know because different school systems have got m[ore]- more or less money to take care of that sort of thing you've got counselors and
sw2744B-ms98-a-0095 426.953750 431.317000 all that but you know you can counsel a kid eight hours a day and then he goes home and
sw2744B-ms98-a-0096 431.317000 437.014375 and uh uh you know in the in worst cases he's got parents either on drugs or
sw2744B-ms98-a-0097 437.014375 442.371375 or something like that or they don't care you know mamma wha[t]- guess what i did in school today well who cares you know

sw2744B-ms98-a-0113 476.842625 483.943500 oh especially Asian Japanese families coming here in Plano we've got uh quite a few
sw2744B-ms98-a-0114 483.943500 490.470000 uh engineering types people who have come from Japan and they put their kids in the US schools and they're appalled
sw2744B-ms98-a-0115 490.470000 497.538750 you know not so much at what the schools are teaching but what they let the kids get away with you know they they see most
sw2744B-ms98-a-0116 497.538750 502.194375 uh they're they're quite upset about the uh the disruptive
sw2744B-ms98-a-0117 502.194375 509.813750 influence of school most of them_1 would say you know those people should be removed from the school system and in Japan they would be you know
