sw2748B-ms98-a-0003 1.867500 3.946000 [noise] 
sw2748B-ms98-a-0004 3.946000 9.027500 oh recently let me think actually recently i've just done some you know
sw2748B-ms98-a-0005 9.027500 20.524375 touch up types of painting although i'm looking at a few of the ceilings like uh in the family room and uh i'm wondering if i should take that project on myself and that's a little harder uh
sw2748B-ms98-a-0006 20.524375 34.806500 yeah you know me [laughter-well] so yeah i do most of the painting myself uh you know uh outdoors no you know outdoors uh gets too high with you know have to hire a professional for that
sw2748B-ms98-a-0007 34.806500 36.105500 um what about you
sw2748B-ms98-a-0008 36.105500 40.994375 [silence]
sw2748B-ms98-a-0009 40.994375 43.019500 [laughter]
sw2748B-ms98-a-0010 43.019500 57.567125 [silence]
sw2748B-ms98-a-0011 57.567125 58.911750 uh-huh
sw2748B-ms98-a-0012 58.911750 67.434125 [silence]
sw2748B-ms98-a-0013 67.434125 69.795375 oh okay
sw2748B-ms98-a-0014 69.795375 74.653500 so that that's a lot of uh yeah you've got your work laid out for you
sw2748B-ms98-a-0015 74.653500 81.989375 [silence]
sw2748B-ms98-a-0016 81.989375 87.545000 right well that's that's a good idea get get the pointing over with and then the carpet's going to go anyway
sw2748B-ms98-a-0017 87.545000 92.702500 right yeah well uh uh i'm thinking for this summer of
sw2748B-ms98-a-0018 92.702500 103.437750 uh i'm contemplating actually uh doing a lot of wallpaper i think in the basement you know what having a problem of the basement being finished but you know with uh
sw2748B-ms98-a-0019 103.437750 116.105250 it's being used as a recreation center [noise] it's uh it's con[stantly]- either a matter of constantly touching up or maybe putting something more durable that i can wipe down and doesn't have to be painted all the time
sw2748B-ms98-a-0020 116.105250 119.354750 and so i'm thinking of maybe uh
sw2748B-ms98-a-0021 119.354750 125.939625 you know if i can find some fairly neutral tasteful wallpapers of maybe just papering and
sw2748B-ms98-a-0022 125.939625 138.961750 and that has seemed to work pretty well upstairs you know with with kids so it's uh you know it doesn't require that every year the house has to be repainted which usually i guess most people must paint about every two years
sw2748B-ms98-a-0023 138.961750 145.813625 [silence]
sw2748B-ms98-a-0024 145.813625 148.987500 oh really yeah i i don't know i always assumed
sw2748B-ms98-a-0025 148.987500 158.819875 [silence]
sw2748B-ms98-a-0026 158.819875 167.666625 yeah well yeah i think that's true i mean some of the areas haven't been touched since we moved in six years ago
sw2748B-ms98-a-0027 167.666625 182.432750 i know exterior paints really if it's done well uh two good coats and a primer uh i think uh exterior paint probably should last somewhere around seven to ten years i think
sw2748B-ms98-a-0028 182.432750 197.001375 uh i i thought so you know i would say no less than definitely no less than five i think if your exterior paint is peeling after a year or two then there's probably something going on with the wood uh
sw2748B-ms98-a-0029 197.001375 211.686750 i don't know uh that that's my impression people don't do the outsides as often i know in this neighborhood it seemed like last year everybody was going crazy to have their exterior painted and that was the the first time for most people
sw2748B-ms98-a-0030 211.686750 221.979375 uh yeah trim yeah the aluminum doesn't need to be painted but yeah the trim and most people were doing it last year for the first time and that was five years
sw2748B-ms98-a-0031 221.979375 231.496875 uh course the f[irst]- original coat was so bad that maybe five years even wouldn't have been necessary if it had been done correctly the first time you know
sw2748B-ms98-a-0032 231.496875 244.179000 uh interior i don't know i have known people that every about every two years they they redo their paint and i guess a lot of the the drywall in these houses soaks so much of the paint in
sw2748B-ms98-a-0033 244.179000 256.402500 and uh maybe in a older plastered house this wouldn't uh this would be too often but i think i think with the drywall they use now the plaster board really seems to soak in the paint
sw2748B-ms98-a-0034 256.402500 261.411125 so i'm not i'm not sure two years would be too often i don't want to do it that oft[en]- [laughter]
sw2748B-ms98-a-0035 261.411125 274.546500 no no i don't want to it's a that's one of the things i don't enjoy painting that much i guess uh it's okay for a while but i find it gets it gets uh boring or tiring pretty quickly [laughter] so yeah
sw2748B-ms98-a-0036 274.546500 277.022500 yeah yeah
sw2748B-ms98-a-0037 277.022500 279.417250 so [laughter]
sw2748B-ms98-a-0038 279.417250 283.425250 uh we[ll]- yeah oh ri[ght]- [laughter] [laughter-that's] [laughter-really]
sw2748B-ms98-a-0039 283.425250 287.555500 [silence]
sw2748B-ms98-a-0040 287.555500 289.361625 yeah yeah
sw2748B-ms98-a-0041 289.361625 290.503750 [silence]
sw2748B-ms98-a-0042 290.503750 292.235750 no
sw2748B-ms98-a-0043 292.235750 296.929000 no no not at all i i i think that uh
sw2748B-ms98-a-0044 296.929000 309.319625 what uh the the work that i've done that's one reason i do it uh if if i really felt that it was going to be a sloppy job and i was sorry you afterward the way it looks i wouldn't attempt to take it on but
sw2748B-ms98-a-0045 309.319625 315.410750 uh there are a few tricks you know that you learn to use and i've found that uh
sw2748B-ms98-a-0046 315.410750 322.976750 the one sided paper type of tape that peels off is is just excellent i used to
sw2748B-ms98-a-0047 322.976750 333.174875 i used to try to edge when as i'd get up toward the ceilings and i found that's really impossible to do but when you use the the one edge paper uh
sw2748B-ms98-a-0048 333.174875 345.268625 it it really makes a nice neat job You know you let the paint dry for about a half an hour an hour and peel it off and it's a perfect clean line and and i've found that it can also be used
sw2748B-ms98-a-0049 345.268625 353.870125 uh well like i've gone back and i've painted after wallpaper has been put up around crown moldings and things like that
sw2748B-ms98-a-0050 353.870125 366.832375 and again the tape really comes in handy you just cover up anything you don't want paint to get on and paint and take it off and sometimes you can even reuse the tape it just peels off like those notepads type of thing
sw2748B-ms98-a-0051 366.832375 377.106000 no it's not a masking tape it's it's about uh you can get it in different widths i'd say the most narrow is about two inches and it gets about as wide as four inches
sw2748B-ms98-a-0052 377.106000 385.706750 the glue on it is not across the whole thing it's only across the top much like the yellow pads that you peel off
sw2748B-ms98-a-0053 385.706750 389.438000 and it just comes in big rolls and so if you're doing
sw2748B-ms98-a-0054 389.438000 399.335125 you don't want to get paint on the ceiling for example say you want the ceiling a different color [noise] you roll this tape all along the length of the room
sw2748B-ms98-a-0055 399.335125 414.229375 you paint right up against it you can even get it on the tape itself and then whenever the paint is dry most interior paints seem like they're dry within a a half an hour an hour you just peel this tape off and it's enough that
sw2748B-ms98-a-0056 414.229375 423.268750 enough glue or whatever is on it that it it stays while you're painting but it doesn't do any damage to paint or wallpaper that's underneath it
sw2748B-ms98-a-0057 423.268750 438.228500 so it's really good uh you know i've put it up along the uh well i've had borders up near the ceiling in the living room i've put the tape along there and then painted the crown molding and it did[n't]- didn't do any damage to the wallpaper
sw2748B-ms98-a-0058 438.228500 450.406375 uh so that's you know so i think there are a few little things uh different size brushes good brushes i guess a lot of people make the mistake i've found good brushes make a big difference
sw2748B-ms98-a-0059 450.406375 451.362000 uh
sw2748B-ms98-a-0060 451.362000 455.037750 [silence]
sw2748B-ms98-a-0061 455.037750 461.181500 oh i've had yes i've used those and i like those actually they cover a lot more area
sw2748B-ms98-a-0062 461.181500 473.676000 and they're not as [noise] you don't get drips as well you can get drips you have to be a little careful but they hold quite a bit of paint so i found you're not constantly dipping like with a brush
sw2748B-ms98-a-0063 473.676000 484.253750 and uh it goes on very nice and evenly like sometimes with brushes you can sort of see streaks if you get it too thick and you don't have splatters like with a roller
sw2748B-ms98-a-0064 484.253750 490.461000 so i do i do like those and sometimes i guess if you're good at it you could uh
sw2748B-ms98-a-0065 490.461000 500.291125 you could use it to inch up towards ceilings and things like that although i've never been [noise] that good at doing that i've found that the tape works best for me
sw2748B-ms98-a-0066 500.291125 515.501625 [silence]
sw2748B-ms98-a-0067 515.501625 516.985875 oh is that right
sw2748B-ms98-a-0068 516.985875 523.000000 [silence]
sw2748B-ms98-a-0069 523.000000 524.032500 uh-huh
sw2748B-ms98-a-0070 524.032500 525.206375 yeah
sw2748B-ms98-a-0071 525.206375 529.183375 [silence]
sw2748B-ms98-a-0072 529.183375 537.119125 yeah yeah well i don't yeah that's right i don't i don't know i guess maybe the trick with the pads on the ceiling is that
sw2748B-ms98-a-0073 537.119125 550.788500 you have to put a minimal amount of paint on there you probably aren't going to be able to cover as much of a surface as you would if you're doing it on a wall because if it drips you can just sort of smooth it all out uh
sw2748B-ms98-a-0074 550.788500 563.818875 and i haven't tried that but that's an idea because i find that ceilings are really difficult in terms of how you have to be positioned to do them and your arms are up so [laughter] it's tiring uh
sw2748B-ms98-a-0075 563.818875 567.070375 [silence]
sw2748B-ms98-a-0076 567.070375 578.176750 [laughter] yeah that's true uh so have you been happy with the painting that you've done or do you wish that you you had hired a professional or
sw2748B-ms98-a-0077 578.176750 582.491250 [silence]
sw2748B-ms98-a-0078 582.491250 583.779125 right
sw2748B-ms98-a-0079 583.779125 585.067000 [silence]
sw2748B-ms98-a-0080 585.067000 587.179250 yeah yeah
sw2748B-ms98-a-0081 587.179250 589.339500 [silence]
sw2748B-ms98-a-0082 589.339500 590.777750 right
sw2748B-ms98-a-0083 590.777750 593.378375 [silence]
sw2748B-ms98-a-0084 593.378375 598.590000 wha[t]- does scrubbing is that just is that to get smudges off so they
