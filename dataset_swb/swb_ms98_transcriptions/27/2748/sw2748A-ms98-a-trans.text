sw2748A-ms98-a-0004 35.808500 39.462625 well my kitchen ceiling has needed painting
sw2748A-ms98-a-0005 39.462625 52.150625 for uh four years now and i'm [noise] having painted the apartment that i left in Syracuse i i really hesitate to do ceilings because i get more paint on me than on on the the ceiling but 
sw2748A-ms98-a-0006 52.150625 58.435000 now that they redid the roofs all of our ceilings need it because it popped a lot of nails
sw2748A-ms98-a-0007 58.435000 69.055000 so i think this summer i'm going to take on the kitchen first and then try to do the others because i want to pull up the carpeting and put hardwood all through the house
sw2748A-ms98-a-0008 69.055000 71.358500 so i think [laughter]

sw2748A-ms98-a-0010 73.080250 82.818125 [laughter] right i figure by by doing it before i put in the carpeting [laughter] you know the carpet is so bad whatever i spill it's too bad [laughter]

sw2748A-ms98-a-0074 498.672625 504.767750 right now even with tape i think i was just thinking of using the pads instead of a brush
sw2748A-ms98-a-0075 504.767750 515.029750 but for ceilings i did try it and [laughter] and uh i got a lot of paint on the kitchen table i was trying to to just patch the the kitchen ceiling there
sw2748A-ms98-a-0076 515.029750 523.579000 yeah and so i have to learn how to use pads but i have a friend in Syracuse who who paints everything with pads and she does ceilings
sw2748A-ms98-a-0077 523.579000 530.082125 so i'm going to have to ask her what the trick is she'll probably say hire me to come down and do it [laughter]
sw2748A-ms98-a-0078 530.082125 531.632375 [laughter]
sw2748A-ms98-a-0079 531.632375 543.001750 [silence]

sw2748A-ms98-a-0084 562.018875 567.680750 right that's why i want to do the kitchen first i figure i can stand on the kitchen table [laughter]
sw2748A-ms98-a-0085 567.680750 569.241625 [silence]

sw2748A-ms98-a-0087 570.969875 576.068875 [silence]
sw2748A-ms98-a-0088 576.068875 584.562875 no i i'm happy with it but i just don't do it very often or very much because it's so time consuming and because i am tend to be a perfectionist about it
sw2748A-ms98-a-0089 584.562875 588.847125 and you know what i figure is first i have to scrub the walls
sw2748A-ms98-a-0090 588.847125 595.482500 and i mean if you hire a painter they don't do that just
sw2748A-ms98-a-0091 595.482500 597.566375 [silence]
sw2748A-ms98-a-0092 597.566375 598.590000 no to
