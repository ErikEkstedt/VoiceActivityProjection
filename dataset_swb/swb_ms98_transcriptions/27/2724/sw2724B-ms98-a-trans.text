sw2724B-ms98-a-0007 26.868250 37.557500 hm that's pretty impressive um [noise] i guess i bicycle uh the amount varies as much as a hundred fifty miles a week um
sw2724B-ms98-a-0008 37.557500 42.228250 i guess i play softball one night a week and i backpack a lot over the summer
sw2724B-ms98-a-0009 42.228250 49.467250 yeah -[th]at's that's about the extent of it i mean i don't do any of those things particularly you know for exercise
sw2724B-ms98-a-0010 49.467250 58.767625 but um i guess the bicycling is the one thing i'll sort of like do if i feel like i need to go exercise um but i do it mostly for fun
sw2724B-ms98-a-0011 58.767625 64.244500 [silence]
sw2724B-ms98-a-0012 64.244500 77.006750 [noise] it it it varies uh out near my house is pretty hilly um but sometimes i bike to work which is about um a fifteen mile trip each way and that's mostly flat
sw2724B-ms98-a-0013 77.006750 78.046875 [silence]
sw2724B-ms98-a-0014 78.046875 81.476125 about forty five fifty minutes
sw2724B-ms98-a-0015 81.476125 85.888125 [silence]
sw2724B-ms98-a-0016 85.888125 88.735875 yeah it can be a pain um
sw2724B-ms98-a-0017 88.735875 101.636000 basically uh i work on a campus so i can store my bike in my office and walk across the uh campus to the uh gym use the shower there uh but it's it's enough of a pain that
sw2724B-ms98-a-0018 101.636000 106.767250 i did it consistently one year i would commute everyday um
sw2724B-ms98-a-0019 106.767250 114.603625 but it just became such a pain i mean we were talking you know forty five or fifty minutes for biking um and sometimes longer if you had adverse wind
sw2724B-ms98-a-0020 114.603625 125.609875 and then another half an hour you know to cool down and take a shower and all this kind of stuff it was a big hunk o[f]- w[ell]- hunk of the day um and then of course another hour to get back home um
sw2724B-ms98-a-0021 125.609875 135.428250 so i've been doing that less and and concentrating more on you know light biking when i get home on the evening and then you know some more on the weekends

sw2724B-ms98-a-0060 287.913250 294.238250 yeah i'm not sure why that is i mean generally in the midwest it seems to be less much less i mean maybe it's because_1 of the winters
sw2724B-ms98-a-0061 294.238250 303.557625 uh or maybe just because you know there's there's a lot more flat lands you know out in the west so it makes biking a better alternative for transportation

sw2724B-ms98-a-0074 343.193750 354.526250 you know i guess the last time i did it before that was college which was about ten years ago and uh yeah i guess i just never really thought about it much for a while um
sw2724B-ms98-a-0075 354.526250 361.729125 until i suddenly [disevered/discovered] all my friends were basically biking a lot [noise] and so i thought i'd try it too

sw2724B-ms98-a-0089 417.970250 425.550875 no i'm not that hard-core i mean there are some people in fact there are a lot of people who'll ride outside in the snow they've got a uh mountain bike you know with the big knobby tires
sw2724B-ms98-a-0090 425.550875 435.044500 and i don't do that i basically i i pretty much lay off for the winter uh-hum i was thinking of getting rollers for the last winter you know because_1 it'll help your balance when you're indoor training
sw2724B-ms98-a-0091 435.044500 442.827875 um b[ut]- but i just you know more or less stuck to like an exercise bike and that kind of thing um
sw2724B-ms98-a-0092 442.827875 451.106500 [noise] but yeah i mean winters are kind of a problem so i'm more or less out of shape now that i've been biking i guess this year for just a couple of weeks
sw2724B-ms98-a-0093 451.106500 458.056375 um but you know up here it's [vocalized-noise] [laughter-it's] [laughter-only] stopped snowing since then uh 
sw2724B-ms98-a-0094 458.056375 462.793875 [noise] but yeah it's it's it's it's pretty good it's uh the main
sw2724B-ms98-a-0095 462.793875 472.146500 the main thing i guess for me is just to enjoy it because once it starts seeming like you know exercise and a chore [laughter-i'll] [laughter-lay] [laughter-off] [laughter-of] [laughter-it] [laughter-more]
sw2724B-ms98-a-0096 472.146500 476.872000 [silence]
sw2724B-ms98-a-0097 476.872000 485.562250 oh yeah yeah i try to go someplace pretty different you know every week i rotate around um about four different routes
sw2724B-ms98-a-0098 485.562250 493.491625 um from my house or i'll sometimes come in to school it's nice coming it's n[ice]- it's nice riding to school be[cause]- it's all along a canal path
sw2724B-ms98-a-0099 493.491625 500.730625 um because_1 it's just it's along the Erie Canal up here [noise] uh University of Rochester
