sw2790A-ms98-a-0041 190.886875 196.853500 i'm surprised that the main people you work for are women that do stay home
sw2790A-ms98-a-0042 196.853500 200.189625 i would think it would be women that were working full-time
sw2790A-ms98-a-0043 200.189625 204.658125 [silence]
sw2790A-ms98-a-0044 204.658125 205.691000 huh

sw2790A-ms98-a-0051 230.386875 234.353625 [silence]
sw2790A-ms98-a-0052 234.353625 240.266625 yeah we're going to try and have her stay home for as long as possible
sw2790A-ms98-a-0053 240.266625 242.940500 [silence]
sw2790A-ms98-a-0054 242.940500 244.099000 what do you think
sw2790A-ms98-a-0055 244.099000 246.006250 [silence]
sw2790A-ms98-a-0056 246.006250 249.793750 yeah we think it's uh that important and
sw2790A-ms98-a-0057 249.793750 257.821500 i i kind of hope that the trend goes back in that direction i'm a a counselor and a therapist and i work with adolescents and
sw2790A-ms98-a-0058 257.821500 263.081250 i see some of the problems the kids have when they don't have a real good family structure
sw2790A-ms98-a-0059 263.081250 267.182875 [silence]
sw2790A-ms98-a-0060 267.182875 268.620125 uh-huh

sw2790A-ms98-a-0062 288.425375 289.529500 um-hum
sw2790A-ms98-a-0063 289.529500 302.301750 [silence]
sw2790A-ms98-a-0064 302.301750 303.750125 true
sw2790A-ms98-a-0065 303.750125 311.382000 well the husbands' roles are almost nonexistent in family anymore in terms of being the father figure and
sw2790A-ms98-a-0066 311.382000 318.356875 and with women working so much they're kind of pulled out of it too so kids are raised around their friends and by the media
sw2790A-ms98-a-0067 318.356875 320.396750 [silence]
sw2790A-ms98-a-0068 320.396750 321.566250 that's contributed
sw2790A-ms98-a-0069 321.566250 324.095625 [silence]
sw2790A-ms98-a-0070 324.095625 328.855750 yeah maybe that's contributed to a lot of the problems that we see all the time so
sw2790A-ms98-a-0071 328.855750 334.605250 if there was some way for for women to to stay home even if they could work you know there are a lot of
sw2790A-ms98-a-0072 334.605250 339.755500 jobs that are coming about like in computers at home and those types of things that would
sw2790A-ms98-a-0073 339.755500 342.396250 at least in some ways
sw2790A-ms98-a-0074 342.396250 344.158500 bridge the gap
sw2790A-ms98-a-0075 344.158500 369.298125 [silence]
sw2790A-ms98-a-0076 369.298125 370.426750 about
sw2790A-ms98-a-0077 370.426750 380.761000 [silence]
sw2790A-ms98-a-0078 380.761000 383.470375 they'll understand them
sw2790A-ms98-a-0079 383.470375 390.430750 the divorce rate keeps hovering around fifty percent or so and it got higher than that for a while um
sw2790A-ms98-a-0080 390.430750 391.861000 it's hard to say
sw2790A-ms98-a-0081 391.861000 393.788750 [silence]
sw2790A-ms98-a-0082 393.788750 397.322500 families are such a strange configuration anymore
sw2790A-ms98-a-0083 397.322500 401.061625 um i i see a lot of families where you know in the in the
sw2790A-ms98-a-0084 401.061625 404.503875 back i grew up about the same time you did
sw2790A-ms98-a-0085 404.503875 406.396000 back in those times we
sw2790A-ms98-a-0086 406.396000 409.253375 pretty much were taught how to be responsible
sw2790A-ms98-a-0087 409.253375 415.690000 nowadays it's not the case kids don't kids are bombarded with all kinds of junk and
sw2790A-ms98-a-0088 415.690000 421.092875 one of the reasons i guess is because there's so much more income in the family with both parents working
sw2790A-ms98-a-0089 421.092875 435.267625 they get bombarded with junk and they don't have to do anything around the house they never learned to be responsible when the bigger trend called the boomerang kids where they move out for a while and they come back and you got twenty and thirty year olds who are living at home with mom and dad
sw2790A-ms98-a-0090 435.267625 442.688250 so [laughter] know you create a bigger bigger family generation after generation but not really on purpose
sw2790A-ms98-a-0091 442.688250 443.858750 so
sw2790A-ms98-a-0092 443.858750 445.489500 [silence]
sw2790A-ms98-a-0093 445.489500 449.068500 it's not not a real functional situation anyway
sw2790A-ms98-a-0094 449.068500 450.658875 [silence]
sw2790A-ms98-a-0095 450.658875 458.450125 i don't know it's i don't know that that trend's going to change the single parent type families and the blended families
sw2790A-ms98-a-0096 458.450125 462.256375 as long as we've got so many other crazy things going on in society
sw2790A-ms98-a-0097 462.256375 483.153500 [silence]
sw2790A-ms98-a-0098 483.153500 484.503000 uh-huh

sw2790A-ms98-a-0100 486.903125 493.150625 yeah it is i guess unless unless there's a a major swing in the change of what's important to people
sw2790A-ms98-a-0101 493.150625 495.727375 you know probably keep going downhill
sw2790A-ms98-a-0102 495.727375 498.491375 [silence]
sw2790A-ms98-a-0103 498.491375 505.821750 and i i don't know we we feel like that that we can make it on one income it it may be tough but we may have to give up some
sw2790A-ms98-a-0104 505.821750 506.972125 [silence]
sw2790A-ms98-a-0105 506.972125 508.259125 some things
