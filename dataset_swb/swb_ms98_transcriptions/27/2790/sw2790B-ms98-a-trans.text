sw2790B-ms98-a-0008 32.583625 35.595000 um well into high school
sw2790B-ms98-a-0009 35.595000 41.656625 so i i had the advantage of having a mom at home that nowadays kids
sw2790B-ms98-a-0010 41.656625 44.478625 it's a luxury item for
sw2790B-ms98-a-0011 44.478625 46.816250 mothers to be home with their kids
sw2790B-ms98-a-0012 46.816250 54.609500 [silence]

sw2790B-ms98-a-0017 72.566750 76.918625 it seems like there's it seems like there's a grass roots um
sw2790B-ms98-a-0018 76.918625 88.332875 effort or whatever going on i i um clean houses part-time and almost all the people that i clean for believe it or not are mothers that don't work
sw2790B-ms98-a-0019 88.332875 90.069875 um
sw2790B-ms98-a-0020 90.069875 97.565375 they're all um it's and it's i think it's kind of a new movement it's going back towards
sw2790B-ms98-a-0021 97.565375 106.217000 you know women have come into the work force in the last twenty thirty years and now they're wanting to go back to the old days where you know
sw2790B-ms98-a-0022 106.217000 111.300625 women stayed home with the kids you know and try to give the kids quality time
sw2790B-ms98-a-0023 111.300625 116.287125 and i i think that in the future you're i think you're going to see a lot more
sw2790B-ms98-a-0024 116.287125 122.633125 um women choosing to not work after they have a baby 
sw2790B-ms98-a-0025 122.633125 125.973000 um i think with uh
sw2790B-ms98-a-0026 125.973000 128.325875 the uh
sw2790B-ms98-a-0027 128.325875 141.417875 the work force with the the salaries that a lot of a lot of the women that i work for have husbands who are um vice presidents of companies and i think with uh um
sw2790B-ms98-a-0028 141.417875 146.176875 it seems like it's more the upper-class people
sw2790B-ms98-a-0029 146.176875 158.880375 um i don't see it as much the like in my situation where i don't i don't have children yet but ideally i would like to be able to stay home with my kids but realistically that's i'm i'm
sw2790B-ms98-a-0030 158.880375 161.971625 realizing that's probably not going to be possible
sw2790B-ms98-a-0031 161.971625 167.242375 um for middle-class people to be able to live just on one income
sw2790B-ms98-a-0032 167.242375 171.476875 [silence]
sw2790B-ms98-a-0033 171.476875 176.950000 uh-huh i think it's going to be a luxury item to be able to stay home with your kids
sw2790B-ms98-a-0034 176.950000 178.688500 [silence]
sw2790B-ms98-a-0035 178.688500 189.162625 you know it's going to kind of [noise] kind of go along with the BMW in the driveway and or in the garage or whatever um and the quarter of a million dollar home or whatever
sw2790B-ms98-a-0036 189.162625 199.454250 [silence]
sw2790B-ms98-a-0037 199.454250 208.268375 yeah believe it or not though the all the women that stay home are real busy when they are home um they're real active in volunteer work
sw2790B-ms98-a-0038 208.268375 209.707875 um
sw2790B-ms98-a-0039 209.707875 213.889875 one of the women is real active with uh muscular dystrophy
sw2790B-ms98-a-0040 213.889875 218.520125 and uh does a lot of of work with them
sw2790B-ms98-a-0041 218.520125 224.065125 on a volunteer basis but it's still it's almost like a job but she just doesn't get paid for it

sw2790B-ms98-a-0050 260.752625 264.850000 yeah i i see a difference in the generation of
sw2790B-ms98-a-0051 264.850000 267.962750 even the generation before me
sw2790B-ms98-a-0052 267.962750 280.066750 uh were you know mom was like um Mrs Cleaver uh you know June Cleaver or whatever where the the attitudes were a lot different um
sw2790B-ms98-a-0053 280.066750 284.069250 as far as i think the kids back then seemed to be a lot more
sw2790B-ms98-a-0054 284.069250 285.671000 um
sw2790B-ms98-a-0055 285.671000 289.290750 there wasn't a lot of the drugs and alcohol and
sw2790B-ms98-a-0056 289.290750 295.301125 um a lot of the the things that are going on in today's society i think morally
sw2790B-ms98-a-0057 295.301125 297.940000 um it seems like there was
sw2790B-ms98-a-0058 297.940000 302.682625 the peo[ple]- people were a lot better back then as far as having higher standards
sw2790B-ms98-a-0059 302.682625 303.578875 [silence]

sw2790B-ms98-a-0065 320.224250 324.908875 and i think i think you're going to see a lot more of that in the future
sw2790B-ms98-a-0066 324.908875 338.031375 [silence]

sw2790B-ms98-a-0071 351.564125 358.754375 in the future um the the family unit as it as it once was known is is going to be nonexistent

sw2790B-ms98-a-0075 370.251500 379.582000 uh as far as do do you think there's going to be still a family unit or or do you think that um the trend is going more towards single parenting
sw2790B-ms98-a-0076 379.582000 403.722375 [silence]
sw2790B-ms98-a-0077 403.722375 405.062375 um-hum

sw2790B-ms98-a-0087 463.150375 469.738000 yeah i i think that eventually the the family unit's just not going to even exist anymore
sw2790B-ms98-a-0088 469.738000 473.628625 it's it is that like you said the divorce rate is getting so high
sw2790B-ms98-a-0089 473.628625 478.958875 that i think there's going to be more single parent families than there are
sw2790B-ms98-a-0090 478.958875 480.408875 um
sw2790B-ms98-a-0091 480.408875 483.581625 you know two parent families

sw2790B-ms98-a-0095 509.089250 515.111125 i i think in the long run though your child will benefit from that it'll make the
sw2790B-ms98-a-0096 515.111125 517.396125 the strain worthwhile
sw2790B-ms98-a-0097 517.396125 521.790500 [silence]
