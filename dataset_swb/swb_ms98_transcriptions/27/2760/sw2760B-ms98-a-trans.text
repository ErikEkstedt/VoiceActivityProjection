sw2760B-ms98-a-0002 4.018875 5.451500 yes i have
sw2760B-ms98-a-0003 5.451500 6.518750 [silence]
sw2760B-ms98-a-0004 6.518750 12.922500 well i have a VCR and i've had to return it a couple of times because of the same part failure
sw2760B-ms98-a-0005 12.922500 14.540125 and uh
sw2760B-ms98-a-0006 14.540125 17.207375 it's still not getting a real good picture
sw2760B-ms98-a-0007 17.207375 19.289500 and after
sw2760B-ms98-a-0008 19.289500 23.904625 about three hundred dollars i think it's going to be worth it just to go ahead and get a new machine
sw2760B-ms98-a-0009 23.904625 24.791500 [silence]
sw2760B-ms98-a-0010 24.791500 25.459125 so
sw2760B-ms98-a-0011 25.459125 26.831625 [silence]
sw2760B-ms98-a-0012 26.831625 31.384000 well i didn't get the extended warranty it was out of warranty just barely so uh
sw2760B-ms98-a-0013 31.384000 32.341500 [laughter]
sw2760B-ms98-a-0014 32.341500 33.413875 [silence]
sw2760B-ms98-a-0015 33.413875 34.746250 so how about you
sw2760B-ms98-a-0016 34.746250 79.039875 [silence]
sw2760B-ms98-a-0017 79.039875 91.771750 well i will agree with that we've had some run ins especially with buttons as soon as you get them home the buttons fall off after the first time and uh the threads on the inside of the garments
sw2760B-ms98-a-0018 91.771750 101.495250 seem like they're just they don't cut threads off they're just a wads of threads and stitching does come undone you know fairly soon and then the prices you pay for them are ridiculous
sw2760B-ms98-a-0019 101.495250 113.319625 [silence]
sw2760B-ms98-a-0020 113.319625 116.745750 not only that but they're no better than a lot of the the the
sw2760B-ms98-a-0021 116.745750 118.921000 non name brand stuff so
sw2760B-ms98-a-0022 118.921000 182.821875 [silence]
sw2760B-ms98-a-0023 182.821875 189.999625 well [vocalized-noise] the Americans just haven't gotten the message yet that's one thing because i'm i'm the same way we i do own an American
sw2760B-ms98-a-0024 189.999625 199.455250 car well a truck but uh in trucks i think you're pretty safe but in cars i've not had an American car that i've been really pleased with
sw2760B-ms98-a-0025 199.455250 212.730875 one for gas mileage and two uh the reliability things falling off the inside uh you know frequent tune-ups every foreign car i've ever made i mean that i've ever bought i've i've loved it
sw2760B-ms98-a-0026 212.730875 252.632625 [silence]
sw2760B-ms98-a-0027 252.632625 259.662250 well clutches are something that you really can't judge i mean they they some go out faster than others and
sw2760B-ms98-a-0028 259.662250 265.650875 you know that's those kind of items like that wear items there's no way you can judge
sw2760B-ms98-a-0029 265.650875 274.439125 uh like brakes uh i we have a a Volvo and the brakes go out on it on about every fifteen thousand miles
sw2760B-ms98-a-0030 274.439125 278.156125 it's just inherent for that car but the the car is super
sw2760B-ms98-a-0031 278.156125 284.500750 i'd rather put the brakes on it and uh and have the the reliability in the car itself but uh
sw2760B-ms98-a-0032 284.500750 286.238000 [silence]
sw2760B-ms98-a-0033 286.238000 289.715750 for the most part it's been a good car we've had it for six years now
sw2760B-ms98-a-0034 289.715750 330.669125 [silence]
sw2760B-ms98-a-0035 330.669125 341.584250 well if you can see the transition what i'm beginning to see is that the Japanese cars and and even just foreign cars in as a whole are beginning to
sw2760B-ms98-a-0036 341.584250 351.694000 get larger but they're able to keep the gas mileage and the reliability whereas the US are beginning to scale down but the gas mileage doesn't improve drastically
sw2760B-ms98-a-0037 351.694000 354.613500 and that right there ought to tell them_1 something
sw2760B-ms98-a-0038 354.613500 362.643875 i know we have the technology but i think it's the the glut of the oil companies and and uh big business and the government
sw2760B-ms98-a-0039 362.643875 367.527000 in trying to control things that they shouldn't control and
sw2760B-ms98-a-0040 367.527000 370.929000 uh they're not controlling the things they should control
sw2760B-ms98-a-0041 370.929000 374.856375 so i think there's a there's a lot of things there to be said and
sw2760B-ms98-a-0042 374.856375 378.195625 uh i will continue to buy
sw2760B-ms98-a-0043 378.195625 382.393500 foreign cars if that's the most reliable product especially when i'm paying for it
sw2760B-ms98-a-0044 382.393500 384.981500 and i and i hate to have that attitude but i do
sw2760B-ms98-a-0045 384.981500 410.433125 [silence]
sw2760B-ms98-a-0046 410.433125 414.067750 oh i know i'm the same way with GM i won't buy a GM car
sw2760B-ms98-a-0047 414.067750 416.077250 yeah i like Ford trucks
sw2760B-ms98-a-0048 416.077250 419.751375 and then i like the foreign cars especially Honda i've had a Honda
sw2760B-ms98-a-0049 419.751375 423.470750 that i liked and uh i mean it was super car
sw2760B-ms98-a-0050 423.470750 425.260750 [silence]
sw2760B-ms98-a-0051 425.260750 426.511750 so i think you know
sw2760B-ms98-a-0052 426.511750 428.728750 [silence]
sw2760B-ms98-a-0053 428.728750 433.439125 well it's been a good truck so far it's only got a forty two thousand miles on it
sw2760B-ms98-a-0054 433.439125 435.784250 and so far so good
sw2760B-ms98-a-0055 435.784250 439.471000 i don't know what's going to happen when it gets another twenty or thirty thousand miles on it 
sw2760B-ms98-a-0056 439.471000 447.027000 [silence]
sw2760B-ms98-a-0057 447.027000 448.943125 oh boy [laughter]
sw2760B-ms98-a-0058 448.943125 455.996000 [silence]
sw2760B-ms98-a-0059 455.996000 458.540625 well trucks trucks keep they hold their value
sw2760B-ms98-a-0060 458.540625 461.240000 pretty much and and even used trucks are pretty expensive
sw2760B-ms98-a-0061 461.240000 483.965875 [silence]
sw2760B-ms98-a-0062 483.965875 489.694875 oh i can't i can certainly understand that i don't want any car payments either in fact when mine's paid off and
sw2760B-ms98-a-0063 489.694875 494.863000 our other one's paid off uh i don't want to get another car until they just both fall [laughter-apart]
sw2760B-ms98-a-0064 494.863000 497.170750 [silence]
sw2760B-ms98-a-0065 497.170750 501.873500 well it's it's just anymore they don't benefit you uh from the income tax stand point
sw2760B-ms98-a-0066 501.873500 506.129875 and uh of course we just can't afford to trade cars like that so
sw2760B-ms98-a-0067 506.129875 511.020750 we're just going to make it go as far as it can and then when we're forced to get one we will
sw2760B-ms98-a-0068 511.020750 514.984250 [silence]
sw2760B-ms98-a-0069 514.984250 516.063375 that's right
sw2760B-ms98-a-0070 516.063375 521.505625 [silence]
sw2760B-ms98-a-0071 521.505625 523.777250 which can be easily done these days
sw2760B-ms98-a-0072 523.777250 544.184750 [silence]

sw2760B-ms98-a-0078 550.647375 560.190000 i was going to say because uh i was going to say if you're up in the in the northern countries the salt would be a big factor on i didn't know how m[uch]- how they take care of the warranty items when it comes down to corrosion and that sort of thing
sw2760B-ms98-a-0079 560.190000 563.714500 [silence]

sw2760B-ms98-a-0092 594.622625 598.408000 and i- i don't know i think a lot of it has to do with uh
sw2760B-ms98-a-0093 598.408000 600.234625 you know just the attitude of the
