sw2760A-ms98-a-0069 295.543250 306.786625 the factory tires on it and the factory [laughter-battery] one i mean that's how good it was i never had one trouble with the battery and which is amazing in five years i didn't have to get a new one and it worked perfectly
sw2760A-ms98-a-0070 306.786625 316.018500 and it was amazing the tires were um excellent and uh you know when i sold it it didn't have that man[y]- it was low mi[leage]- i didn't think i had like thirty seven thousand miles on it which is
sw2760A-ms98-a-0071 316.018500 323.002625 [laughter] nowadays low but uh i got a good price on it it's got good resale value and it was really a good car
