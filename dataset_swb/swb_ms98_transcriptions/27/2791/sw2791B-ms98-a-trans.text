sw2791B-ms98-a-0004 11.256000 16.510125 i- i think there's a lot of waste that that could uh that could be cut out
sw2791B-ms98-a-0005 16.510125 21.310125 if we could get uh politicians to be less less of politicians

sw2791B-ms98-a-0008 24.077375 33.865875 i- i think it needs to be given a really high priority because_1 i- i think it has a horrible effect on the economy and and what we can do as a country and everything else

sw2791B-ms98-a-0022 85.510000 89.502375 right i- i have a hard time with that too now i can understand
sw2791B-ms98-a-0023 89.502375 92.070875 uh for instance the uh
sw2791B-ms98-a-0024 92.070875 97.948625 situation in say the Philippines where they needed some cash to jump start their economy
sw2791B-ms98-a-0025 97.948625 106.236750 but i don't see where we i mean i think it's crazy to be just pouring money into an economy that's obviously mismanaged for instance um

sw2791B-ms98-a-0035 121.369875 125.507375 i'm not sure i understand the i- i guess there's a
sw2791B-ms98-a-0036 125.507375 132.622625 a a reason for [laughter-that] and i- i just don't know enough about it to understand the sense of it because
sw2791B-ms98-a-0037 132.622625 138.097125 it's not an obvious i- i mean on the surface there's no obvious reason why we should be doing that
sw2791B-ms98-a-0038 138.097125 139.771375 i have to agree with you there

sw2791B-ms98-a-0040 148.989250 151.233000 right yeah
sw2791B-ms98-a-0041 151.233000 156.036375 yeah that there's some kind of justification there and i don't know what it is
sw2791B-ms98-a-0042 156.036375 160.313250 and i don't know if i agree with it or [laughter-not] yeah

sw2791B-ms98-a-0050 180.674250 188.372625 right well you know the the the other thing is that you have all th[is]- this all this partisan politics
sw2791B-ms98-a-0051 188.372625 193.082500 where you have a person who's representing a particular state
sw2791B-ms98-a-0052 193.082500 197.520000 and he says well m[y]- my state it would advantageous
sw2791B-ms98-a-0053 197.520000 209.070125 if the [vocalized-noise] if the United States spent money to uh you know to investigate uh potato blithe or something you know and that's and there is tons of that and
sw2791B-ms98-a-0054 209.070125 214.502500 and that is just a horrible waste of money i think and it's and it's done because some
sw2791B-ms98-a-0055 214.502500 221.036250 constituent [vocalized-noise] you know i [vocalized-noise] well it's done because they want to impress the the people that are going to vote for him next month
sw2791B-ms98-a-0056 221.036250 233.851500 and uh if if there was a way to get around that and i think i think some of that could be avoided if we put uh uh a finite term on on some of these peoples um
sw2791B-ms98-a-0057 233.851500 238.986000 uh [vocalized-noise] uh you know stay in office um
sw2791B-ms98-a-0058 238.986000 243.335875 i- i think they would h[ave]- they wouldn't have time to i mean they'd have to
sw2791B-ms98-a-0059 243.335875 246.296875 i think their incentive would be to go out
sw2791B-ms98-a-0060 246.296875 255.494625 uh or and making their mark on history and they [laughter-wouldn't] [laughter-even] [laughter-be] [laughter-wasting] their time on little {piddly} stuff that's just draining draining money
sw2791B-ms98-a-0061 255.494625 262.494250 uh instead they'd concentrate on doing something that was significant um i would hope so anyway

sw2791B-ms98-a-0078 316.243250 328.100000 i've i've really gotten cynical i guess as i've gotten older but i've i've been watching you know the the campaigns and stuff and it's it just it's just amazing how little anybody really says

sw2791B-ms98-a-0086 343.063875 348.435000 no i mean and because it's you know [vocalized-noise] and it's because nothing is black and white
sw2791B-ms98-a-0087 348.435000 353.175625 you know you just can't go up and go up there and say well we're going to we're going to stop crime now
sw2791B-ms98-a-0088 353.175625 356.447500 if it were that simple somebody would have [laughter-done] [laughter-it] a long time ago
sw2791B-ms98-a-0089 356.447500 365.370125 and that's what ki[nd]- you know they there's the people that says well we'll we'll never raise taxes or we will raise taxes or you know it's like the guy who says you're never going to raise taxes
sw2791B-ms98-a-0090 365.370125 371.499625 doesn't isn't realistic about what he see you know what he's doing the guy who says well we should raise taxes 
sw2791B-ms98-a-0091 371.499625 384.514500 will raise them but but it will all it the money will not help anything that's what kills me um [noise] you know the for instance here here in Texas they're talking about uh an income tax
sw2791B-ms98-a-0092 384.514500 391.235250 well i could almost support an income tax if they reduced or got rid of the sales tax
sw2791B-ms98-a-0093 391.235250 401.042625 but nobody's talking about [laughter-that] [laughter-they] want both you know [laughter] no i know and they never go away they just get higher and there's more of them you know

sw2791B-ms98-a-0095 406.019500 411.325250 [laughter]
sw2791B-ms98-a-0096 411.325250 422.160125 yeah my favorite yeah yeah yeah yeah my favorite one about politicians is that a politician's a person who's made it to the top because he didn't have what it takes to make it at the bottom
sw2791B-ms98-a-0097 422.160125 423.318250 yeah

sw2791B-ms98-a-0109 453.689125 458.390875 yeah the the problem is that the budget is so complicated
sw2791B-ms98-a-0110 458.390875 463.894000 and what they're doing are the things that are easy they're making the easy choices
sw2791B-ms98-a-0111 463.894000 466.809750 and and uh um
sw2791B-ms98-a-0112 466.809750 473.275000 and it's and i think part of it is that the budget you know the the economy and the budget is too complicated
sw2791B-ms98-a-0113 473.275000 478.223125 for a lot of the politicians i mean they can't comprehend um
sw2791B-ms98-a-0114 478.223125 485.025750 you know what it takes what it needs they just don't have the expertise the other thing is they can't it's too
sw2791B-ms98-a-0115 485.025750 487.061625 uh it's not in their
sw2791B-ms98-a-0116 487.061625 492.854250 political career interest to make some of the hard decisions that are going to need to be made
sw2791B-ms98-a-0117 492.854250 502.212750 uh and so what you do is you do the obvious things you know and and they they don't really help all that much i mean sure they help some and i'm s[ure]-
sw2791B-ms98-a-0118 502.212750 509.664875 [silence]

sw2791B-ms98-a-0126 524.200500 529.209875 well uh you know i think uh it's got to come from the you know it's it's got to be
sw2791B-ms98-a-0127 529.209875 539.032875 you know there [vocalized-noise] certainly the politicians aren't going to introduce that as a bill [laughter-so] [laughter-so] so you know if something like that's going to happen it's usually because somebody's
sw2791B-ms98-a-0128 539.032875 549.868500 you know somebody has gotten angry enough and has got the time an the energy to to you know have to to develop something from the from the you know ground swell level
sw2791B-ms98-a-0129 549.868500 557.329500 you know where you get a petition up and you you know get signatures and you call for a referendum and it's not easy it's not easy

sw2791B-ms98-a-0136 576.750500 585.542250 that's right well you know it and and what was supposed to be uh so healthy about our our former government is that these were
sw2791B-ms98-a-0137 585.542250 599.948250 regular people who were who you know these were the doctors and the lawyers and the accountants and the janitors and the uh who were in there for their brief period of time to do their to to to serve proudly and
