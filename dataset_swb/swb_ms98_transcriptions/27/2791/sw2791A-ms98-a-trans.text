sw2791A-ms98-a-0003 3.776000 9.609625 [silence]
sw2791A-ms98-a-0004 9.609625 10.819125 oh yeah
sw2791A-ms98-a-0005 10.819125 33.515125 [silence]
sw2791A-ms98-a-0006 33.515125 38.377125 i know that we're affected uh directly uh at TI because of uh
sw2791A-ms98-a-0007 38.377125 49.170000 the defense budget cuts but i certainly think that's one of the the things that they're doing already which is uh wh[ich]- which was [vocalized-noise] needed to be done for probably the last few years uh
sw2791A-ms98-a-0008 49.170000 54.150750 although with the Russian situation and all the world situation changing the way it is uh
sw2791A-ms98-a-0009 54.150750 63.281875 it certainly needed i the obvious one that people all talk about that i still don't understand is uh i'm at work let me turn my radio off here
sw2791A-ms98-a-0010 63.281875 65.707500 uh is uh
sw2791A-ms98-a-0011 65.707500 71.128000 all the foreign aid i you know it's over it's a fifty years roughly since World War II
sw2791A-ms98-a-0012 71.128000 77.571375 i don't understand why we're i understand that we support Israel and all the other countries but why do we have to give them cash
sw2791A-ms98-a-0013 77.571375 79.672500 rather than just selling them
sw2791A-ms98-a-0014 79.672500 86.255625 military things at a discount or something i don't get the id[ea]- the idea of giving people three billion dollars a year
sw2791A-ms98-a-0015 86.255625 97.539375 [silence]
sw2791A-ms98-a-0016 97.539375 98.622750 yeah

sw2791A-ms98-a-0018 103.976000 105.327625 right
sw2791A-ms98-a-0019 105.327625 108.684500 well i think that we should give humanitarian aid and that's it
sw2791A-ms98-a-0020 108.684500 112.826500 you know i think we can loan food or or relief relief aid or whatever you want to call it but i
sw2791A-ms98-a-0021 112.826500 113.835625 [silence]
sw2791A-ms98-a-0022 113.835625 117.678625 not cash money i think you can send them wheat in other [noise] words i think that helps our farmers but
sw2791A-ms98-a-0023 117.678625 119.555375 to send them money i don't i don't
sw2791A-ms98-a-0024 119.555375 121.824000 see under any circumstances where you send anybody money
sw2791A-ms98-a-0025 121.824000 137.950125 [silence]
sw2791A-ms98-a-0026 137.950125 139.260375 right
sw2791A-ms98-a-0027 139.260375 143.969625 i'm amazed that n[either]- neither party or or the which i guess they're independent parties too
sw2791A-ms98-a-0028 143.969625 149.931125 why they don't talk about it i mean they don't bring it up at all why you would think they'd be real having a real campaign with one party or the other
sw2791A-ms98-a-0029 149.931125 152.528000 and they never talk about it they just keep doing it you know
sw2791A-ms98-a-0030 152.528000 157.989000 [silence]
sw2791A-ms98-a-0031 157.989000 162.834375 i- i just like to hear them talk about it you know i like to hear some of the congressmen or senators at least
sw2791A-ms98-a-0032 162.834375 167.815750 say well let's let's bring this before let's examine every one of our foreign aids
sw2791A-ms98-a-0033 167.815750 176.645250 and look like like they did with the defense with the military bases they they investigated all those rightfully wrongly wrongfully whether which ones should be closed i don't know but
sw2791A-ms98-a-0034 176.645250 182.000375 at least they looked at it i think they should look at foreign aid and say hey which ones do we not need to give you know
sw2791A-ms98-a-0035 182.000375 204.669000 [silence]
sw2791A-ms98-a-0036 204.669000 206.073000 right yeah

sw2791A-ms98-a-0044 261.924125 265.673750 yeah i saw one about a month or so ago on Twenty Twenty i think it was
sw2791A-ms98-a-0045 265.673750 270.164375 where one of the congressmen i think it was from Connecticut and i probably will will screw that up but
sw2791A-ms98-a-0046 270.164375 271.711500 he wanted to start
sw2791A-ms98-a-0047 271.711500 275.541250 another drug headquarters in his state
sw2791A-ms98-a-0048 275.541250 278.247500 and no one was asking for it but him
sw2791A-ms98-a-0049 278.247500 282.431375 and he got the money appro[ved]- got it approved by tagging it on to some other bill
sw2791A-ms98-a-0050 282.431375 287.623250 and it di[dn't]- you know the the newsman asked him wh[at]- wh[at]- no one is asking for this why do you you know
sw2791A-ms98-a-0051 287.623250 292.880125 and it was just totally a boondoggle i mean it was just uh him wanting to build something that nobody wanted
sw2791A-ms98-a-0052 292.880125 294.212000 [silence]
sw2791A-ms98-a-0053 294.212000 295.625375 right

sw2791A-ms98-a-0057 298.889000 303.611000 but the drug agency wasn't asking for it he was asking for it you know which didn't make any sense at all
sw2791A-ms98-a-0058 303.611000 306.247125 [silence]
sw2791A-ms98-a-0059 306.247125 307.630250 right
sw2791A-ms98-a-0060 307.630250 313.500500 it is amazing how the the congressmen and senators just start are totally in another world once they get elected

sw2791A-ms98-a-0062 327.730625 331.412250 right or well duh i thought you were going to say what they do
sw2791A-ms98-a-0063 331.412250 334.768625 i i've been trying to go over in my own mind when they say
sw2791A-ms98-a-0064 334.768625 344.571750 we're gonna really if you vote for me we're gonna control crime and drugs and then they don't do anything nothing they don't have they had any president or [laughter-anybody] every done anything against crime and [laughter-drugs] you know

sw2791A-ms98-a-0078 400.534375 403.791000 the funniest thing i heard lately about politicians uh joke was uh
sw2791A-ms98-a-0079 403.791000 406.694000 uh do you know how you can tell it when a politician is lying
sw2791A-ms98-a-0080 406.694000 407.959250 [silence]
sw2791A-ms98-a-0081 407.959250 409.363750 his lips are moving

sw2791A-ms98-a-0083 411.965250 416.008125 th[at]- that that that see that covers is all you know [laughter]
sw2791A-ms98-a-0084 416.008125 421.278375 [silence]
sw2791A-ms98-a-0085 421.278375 429.343250 right yeah but it it is the the budget thing is just and i don't know why they don't talk about it logically it's always always uh
sw2791A-ms98-a-0086 429.343250 436.036875 again the only thing i guess they're doing logically now is the defense which is certainly hurting TI to a degree although we've done so well with the
sw2791A-ms98-a-0087 436.036875 438.955500 Gulf War we got a lot of good positive press
sw2791A-ms98-a-0088 438.955500 443.975250 with all the exotic uh weapon systems and i think we'll get a lot of those you know but uh
sw2791A-ms98-a-0089 443.975250 450.209500 uh you you need to close so many bases and you need to cut out some missiles or i mean some uh programs and all
sw2791A-ms98-a-0090 450.209500 455.064000 uh and they're doing that i think that's that's really good even though it it hurts a lot bit you know

sw2791A-ms98-a-0103 502.125500 508.428375 go ahead i was going to say i know you mentioned it but i don't know why we can't change the laws where the[re]- the congress and the
sw2791A-ms98-a-0104 508.428375 512.236375 senators just have eight years or or terms because the president has it
sw2791A-ms98-a-0105 512.236375 515.955875 and i think that uh is you know you don't want someone in there forever
sw2791A-ms98-a-0106 515.955875 519.582875 and the congressmen go in there forever and th[at's]- that's their whole life then
sw2791A-ms98-a-0107 519.582875 524.478375 and their family's life and every one of their relatives gets on it has got a job you know it's ridiculous

sw2791A-ms98-a-0111 555.711625 557.374625 no that's true
sw2791A-ms98-a-0112 557.374625 561.474000 maybe that long-term though i think that is a a factor that is to keep the
sw2791A-ms98-a-0113 561.474000 564.802500 our government uh rotating you know keep them moving uh
sw2791A-ms98-a-0114 564.802500 567.396750 and not get the career politicians huh
sw2791A-ms98-a-0115 567.396750 572.162875 yeah there's uh historians i thought that keep saying will that that never was meant that the
sw2791A-ms98-a-0116 572.162875 576.368125 politicians would make a career it was just something that you would serve like in the military
sw2791A-ms98-a-0117 576.368125 578.020000 and then you'd be done you know
