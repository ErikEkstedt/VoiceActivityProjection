sw2740A-ms98-a-0002 0.430000 6.945375 um i was thinking about the uh the topic you know while they were searching for a person
sw2740A-ms98-a-0003 6.945375 10.710750 and uh while i was thinking about it i just flipped on my TV
sw2740A-ms98-a-0004 10.710750 16.449250 and it was funny because i thought about today how so much of
sw2740A-ms98-a-0005 16.449250 26.709500 i mean i even my social life is renting movies or sitting at home and you know watching a rented movie or watching a movie on TV
sw2740A-ms98-a-0006 26.709500 34.189750 and just now it's so i mean ev[ery]- everything is just so uh easy that you almost don't have to think of things to do anymore
sw2740A-ms98-a-0007 34.189750 35.757750 you know what i mean
sw2740A-ms98-a-0008 35.757750 43.578750 [silence]
sw2740A-ms98-a-0009 43.578750 44.995375 yeah
sw2740A-ms98-a-0010 44.995375 53.627875 i mean i remember when i was little my friends uh my parents i'm sorry would just go over people's houses and just sort of you know sit and talk 
sw2740A-ms98-a-0011 53.627875 64.481000 and before TV and all that people would sit and listen to the radio and and that i mean life has just changed and become so much more modernized and uh it's really pretty incredible
sw2740A-ms98-a-0012 64.481000 70.483375 [silence]
sw2740A-ms98-a-0013 70.483375 71.966250 oh really
sw2740A-ms98-a-0014 71.966250 75.393125 [silence]
sw2740A-ms98-a-0015 75.393125 77.283125 i know
sw2740A-ms98-a-0016 77.283125 81.683250 [silence]
sw2740A-ms98-a-0017 81.683250 83.036875 uh-huh
sw2740A-ms98-a-0018 83.036875 88.819375 [noise] and you know when you think about oh i was watching reruns of Happy Days the other day and um
sw2740A-ms98-a-0019 88.819375 97.982125 to think that that was the social life of teenagers to go to uh you know a a place like Arnold's and order a soda pop
sw2740A-ms98-a-0020 97.982125 109.390500 and uh you know sit and hang out and and you know just the dress codes the whole atmosphere the whole attitude of teenagers and social life was totally different then
sw2740A-ms98-a-0021 109.390500 111.992250 [silence]
sw2740A-ms98-a-0022 111.992250 113.886000 uh-huh
sw2740A-ms98-a-0023 113.886000 115.564750 uh-huh
sw2740A-ms98-a-0024 115.564750 117.449250 i know
sw2740A-ms98-a-0025 117.449250 124.626625 i know and also um i think that it's so much more dangerous for people now
sw2740A-ms98-a-0026 124.626625 133.923875 i mean before you could go out and and you know you didn't have all the drunk drivers and you didn't have to worry about your kids getting into the wrong crowds and this and that
sw2740A-ms98-a-0027 133.923875 136.333125 and now that's really a problem
sw2740A-ms98-a-0028 136.333125 142.300000 you know [noise] but what what do you do most of the time for social activities
sw2740A-ms98-a-0029 142.300000 144.227250 [silence]
sw2740A-ms98-a-0030 144.227250 145.990875 oh okay
sw2740A-ms98-a-0031 145.990875 153.209000 [silence]
sw2740A-ms98-a-0032 153.209000 154.758875 uh-huh
sw2740A-ms98-a-0033 154.758875 157.889625 [silence]
sw2740A-ms98-a-0034 157.889625 159.378000 yes
sw2740A-ms98-a-0035 159.378000 160.751875 yes
sw2740A-ms98-a-0036 160.751875 166.609875 [silence]
sw2740A-ms98-a-0037 166.609875 168.406375 uh-huh
sw2740A-ms98-a-0038 168.406375 169.778875 uh-huh
sw2740A-ms98-a-0039 169.778875 172.894750 yeah i i definitely agree
sw2740A-ms98-a-0040 172.894750 177.405000 um are your you can't drive yet then can you
sw2740A-ms98-a-0041 177.405000 183.791875 okay oh in a few months you said oh that's good well you're going to find that driving changes your social life completely
sw2740A-ms98-a-0042 183.791875 191.689000 i mean suddenly when you're free to go where you want to go it's amazing i mean i don't know if you'll always have a car around that's a different issue
sw2740A-ms98-a-0043 191.689000 199.725875 but um uh just even being able to go to a movie when you want and and not relying on somebody else it's really pretty nice
sw2740A-ms98-a-0044 199.725875 200.034250 [noise]
sw2740A-ms98-a-0045 200.034250 201.910625 but um
sw2740A-ms98-a-0046 201.910625 206.654000 one thing i love to do and maybe it's just [laughter] because i like to eat
sw2740A-ms98-a-0047 206.654000 210.504000 but one of my favorite things to do with friends is just go out and try a new restaurant
sw2740A-ms98-a-0048 210.504000 220.887250 and uh and i don't know just go and i don't know try like a a new ethnic restaurant you know Indian food or or something like that
sw2740A-ms98-a-0049 220.887250 231.065375 and i think so often we do social things like you were saying you know going out and picking up guys or or whatever social things that don't really
sw2740A-ms98-a-0050 231.065375 237.691000 are that aren't really social like when you go to a movie you're not sitting and talking to anybody
sw2740A-ms98-a-0051 237.691000 245.361875 and when you go to a bar it's usually so loud or so crowded that you even that you can't talk to anybody
sw2740A-ms98-a-0052 245.361875 252.437125 you know um and going out to dinner i think is a nice way you're out you're out of the house um
sw2740A-ms98-a-0053 252.437125 256.962625 i think playing games is something that my friends and i love to do
sw2740A-ms98-a-0054 256.962625 265.876125 we've um we've bought Pictionary you probably know that and i don't know some other games and um and i know this sounds kind of corny but
sw2740A-ms98-a-0055 265.876125 266.983500 [silence]
sw2740A-ms98-a-0056 266.983500 268.824500 it really is
sw2740A-ms98-a-0057 268.824500 271.237750 and if you get the right group of friends
sw2740A-ms98-a-0058 271.237750 275.671375 they have a good attitude about it then you know you can have a pretty good time
sw2740A-ms98-a-0059 275.671375 276.864625 uh-huh
sw2740A-ms98-a-0060 276.864625 277.080750 [noise]
sw2740A-ms98-a-0061 277.080750 285.538500 i personally think that i should have been born in the fifties because i do i do love that era and uh
sw2740A-ms98-a-0062 285.538500 296.227250 and i really think that i could have gotten into i don't know the the music and the lifestyle and um things just seemed so much easier didn't they
sw2740A-ms98-a-0063 296.227250 299.566875 you know it just seems like you didn't have so much to worry about
sw2740A-ms98-a-0064 299.566875 305.580875 [silence]
sw2740A-ms98-a-0065 305.580875 306.893000 yeah
sw2740A-ms98-a-0066 306.893000 309.244000 yeah that's true
sw2740A-ms98-a-0067 309.244000 317.369000 well who knows maybe another maybe the the twenty first century will bring a whole new type of social life
sw2740A-ms98-a-0068 317.369000 318.697000 yeah
sw2740A-ms98-a-0069 318.697000 325.027875 i get very frustrated when i go over to a friend's house and all they want to do is sit and play computer games
sw2740A-ms98-a-0070 325.027875 328.804875 you know i i don't know if you're familiar with any of them but

sw2740A-ms98-a-0072 338.005375 344.480000 you know you get two people in front of a computer playing a computer game and the the next room could be on fire
sw2740A-ms98-a-0073 344.480000 347.468500 and they'll never know it you know
sw2740A-ms98-a-0074 347.468500 347.904000 [noise]
