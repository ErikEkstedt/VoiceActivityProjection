sw2706A-ms98-a-0013 32.484500 36.459750 i've been an engineer all my life and uh
sw2706A-ms98-a-0014 36.459750 46.451375 that's one of the the issues that i have with the company that uh you know salary is is one benefit but uh i feel as an engineer that uh
sw2706A-ms98-a-0015 46.451375 61.166250 you know i take pride in my work and uh getting credit for that and recognition for the work that you do and uh having challenging work uh doing challenging assignments is one of the one of the payments that you get for your time

sw2706A-ms98-a-0018 69.312250 77.454625 but uh you know it's uh sometimes quite a struggle to uh to do work that's challenging and find challenging assignments
sw2706A-ms98-a-0019 77.454625 90.481125 i feel that one of the things that happens in this country is that uh you know engineers become what i call clerical engineers they spend their time pushing paper and doing mundane tasks that could be assigned to uh to other people
