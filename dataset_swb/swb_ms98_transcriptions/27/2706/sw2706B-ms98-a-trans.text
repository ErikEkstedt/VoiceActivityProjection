sw2706B-ms98-a-0010 25.505875 27.999500 uh Bill what kind of a company you with
sw2706B-ms98-a-0011 27.999500 29.995500 [silence]
sw2706B-ms98-a-0012 29.995500 31.953625 oh okay
sw2706B-ms98-a-0013 31.953625 61.942875 [silence]
sw2706B-ms98-a-0014 61.942875 66.009250 right uh do do you think the benefits package is fair
sw2706B-ms98-a-0015 66.009250 68.490500 [silence]
sw2706B-ms98-a-0016 68.490500 69.981125 um-hum
sw2706B-ms98-a-0017 69.981125 76.805875 [silence]
sw2706B-ms98-a-0018 76.805875 78.257875 yeah
sw2706B-ms98-a-0019 78.257875 89.984125 [silence]
sw2706B-ms98-a-0020 89.984125 95.467250 yeah you sound like you sound like my own situation uh h[ow]- how old are you Bill
sw2706B-ms98-a-0021 95.467250 99.692125 oh hey i'm fifty seven sounds like same situation here
sw2706B-ms98-a-0022 99.692125 112.717125 uh i'm with TI of course and our our benefits it it's interesting uh because that's one of the biggest gripes in the company is the benefits whether it be the health insurance or or the food or [laughter] or other things
sw2706B-ms98-a-0023 112.717125 122.984250 uh however recently i've had a chance to sample the outside and uh probably by industry standards we're probably in the top seventy percent
sw2706B-ms98-a-0024 122.984250 130.169250 uh the uh uh i've i've really in fact what i'm doing is i'm uh retiring effective Tuesday and going with another company
sw2706B-ms98-a-0025 130.169250 138.463375 uh primarily for some of the things that you stated uh i've spent uh eight of my last ten years in offshore sites in Asia
sw2706B-ms98-a-0026 138.463375 141.285000 and i've just had a real ball
sw2706B-ms98-a-0027 141.285000 151.173000 and uh since i've been back part of my job is is trouble shooting into the offshore site plants which is okay but the other part [laughter] the other part's pushing paper
sw2706B-ms98-a-0028 151.173000 165.765250 and uh uh which i don't like i got the opportunity to go with another company in fact uh a uh a semiconductor uh uh assembly house that supplies us uh where the uh where the job will be a hundred percent going into their various plants trouble shooting
sw2706B-ms98-a-0029 165.765250 168.960000 and and i'm going to do that beginning the first of May
sw2706B-ms98-a-0030 168.960000 176.210125 but uh uh in[terestingly]- in[terestingly]- interestingly enough though uh the the biggest grind i've been with i've been with TI thirty two years
sw2706B-ms98-a-0031 176.210125 185.084125 uh the biggest gripe in TI is the benefits package but as i go looking at other companies as i've i've had a chance to do uh it's really not all that bad
sw2706B-ms98-a-0032 185.084125 195.974000 uh that the one of the biggest gripes of the benefit package is the insurance program and i guess they've all fallen victim to the high rising costs of medical care 
sw2706B-ms98-a-0033 195.974000 206.012625 and and i- i think that's the type of thing that uh uh that it that it amounts to uh what kind of vacation policy how long have you been with your company Bill
sw2706B-ms98-a-0034 206.012625 214.757625 thirty two ha ha sounds familiar [laughter] what kind of vacation uh uh restrictions do you have or or shouldn't say restrictions policy
sw2706B-ms98-a-0035 214.757625 221.480875 [silence]
sw2706B-ms98-a-0036 221.480875 230.475250 oh neat neat neat uh when when did you get into the uh uh when did you go through the break where you started getting four weeks
sw2706B-ms98-a-0037 230.475250 242.459500 [silence]
sw2706B-ms98-a-0038 242.459500 243.772750 um-hum
sw2706B-ms98-a-0039 243.772750 246.994000 [silence]
sw2706B-ms98-a-0040 246.994000 248.492500 um-hum
sw2706B-ms98-a-0041 248.492500 250.222375 [silence]
sw2706B-ms98-a-0042 250.222375 260.996375 you get a full four weeks yeah yeah we get two weeks after a year uh uh three thr[ee]- three weeks between five and fifteen and four weeks over fifteen
sw2706B-ms98-a-0043 260.996375 265.494000 and uh uh are you allowed to how many days are you allowed to accrue
sw2706B-ms98-a-0044 265.494000 266.998750 [silence]
sw2706B-ms98-a-0045 266.998750 271.719250 oh so you have to flush it out at the end of every year or or you lose it
sw2706B-ms98-a-0046 271.719250 285.461000 okay well we've got we're allowed to accrue a fair bunch i'm not exactly sure uh on a year to year basis what it is because i accrued most of mine before they put in the restrictions uh and then they they grandfathered our old days
sw2706B-ms98-a-0047 285.461000 293.468125 uh but what it what it uh the bottom line is that when you die retire or quit the most you can get paid for is seventy days
sw2706B-ms98-a-0048 293.468125 300.429000 which is fourteen weeks which is which is a pretty nice little bonus so i think with with retiring here in the next three days
sw2706B-ms98-a-0049 300.429000 312.998375 uh i have eighty five days vacation and and it would have been nice to been able to use up fifteen of them in April but i had so many things i had to do before i finished i didn't get to do that so i'm in essence going to be giving those back to the company or most of them back
sw2706B-ms98-a-0050 312.998375 321.232875 but at least i get paid for seventy days which in your situation you don't i mean when you go out you probably get just the ones you have in that current year right
sw2706B-ms98-a-0051 321.232875 323.979625 uh-huh uh-huh that's inter[esting]- interesting
sw2706B-ms98-a-0052 323.979625 325.750000 [silence]
sw2706B-ms98-a-0053 325.750000 334.987125 oh okay well see we we don't have any any such thing as sick leave uh if you're exempt and you've been here over
sw2706B-ms98-a-0054 334.987125 347.954250 three years or four years or something like that you can be sick up to six months and still get paid and and and uh uh that uh do you have a uh long and short term disability program
sw2706B-ms98-a-0055 347.954250 357.749125 yeah and we get half half pay uh or full pay for six months and half pay for the remainder of the disability i guess how it works
sw2706B-ms98-a-0056 357.749125 362.206750 and uh uh that's interesting how how many vacation days do y'all get
sw2706B-ms98-a-0057 362.206750 363.986500 [silence]
sw2706B-ms98-a-0058 363.986500 366.733125 yeah i meant holidays yeah
sw2706B-ms98-a-0059 366.733125 374.989375 [silence]
sw2706B-ms98-a-0060 374.989375 379.250250 oh okay okay so it probably all adds up to the same
sw2706B-ms98-a-0061 379.250250 383.798250 [silence]
sw2706B-ms98-a-0062 383.798250 385.290500 yeah it
sw2706B-ms98-a-0063 385.290500 386.313375 [silence]
sw2706B-ms98-a-0064 386.313375 388.221125 yeah yeah
sw2706B-ms98-a-0065 388.221125 390.496500 [silence]
sw2706B-ms98-a-0066 390.496500 401.960750 no i guess that's true i- i guess see most of us and like yourself where you've got four weeks you can take plenty throughout the year and still have a week even if it weren't a company holiday you'd still have some time left over at Christmas
sw2706B-ms98-a-0067 401.960750 413.460625 and uh i- i guess what happens is we don't have Christmas week we have Christmas plus a day around Christmas a day before or a day after as official holidays
sw2706B-ms98-a-0068 413.460625 421.496500 but there's so many people that are so senior and have so much time off so much vacation time coming that you will find virtually no one in the plant
sw2706B-ms98-a-0069 421.496500 422.999000 [silence]
sw2706B-ms98-a-0070 422.999000 424.997625 yeah probably [laughter]
sw2706B-ms98-a-0071 424.997625 425.988375 [silence]
sw2706B-ms98-a-0072 425.988375 427.505500 yeah
sw2706B-ms98-a-0073 427.505500 433.228625 [silence]
sw2706B-ms98-a-0074 433.228625 435.985875 yeah so they're all gone
sw2706B-ms98-a-0075 435.985875 437.184375 [silence]
sw2706B-ms98-a-0076 437.184375 444.263375 yeah yeah that's that's what happened to us i think the last the last holiday we got was in the middle uh seventies
sw2706B-ms98-a-0077 444.263375 452.981250 and uh uh and that one was the uh Friday after Thanksgiving and i think the reason we got it for a holiday was nobody [laughter-worked] [laughter-it] [laughter-anyway]
sw2706B-ms98-a-0078 452.981250 455.961000 [laughter-it] [laughter-just] [laughter-kept] [laughter-us] from taking a day's vacation
sw2706B-ms98-a-0079 455.961000 467.960875 uh we get we get uh New Years Day Good Friday Memorial Day July Fourth Labor Day uh Thanksgiving and the day after and then Christmas and a day either side of it
sw2706B-ms98-a-0080 467.960875 474.985250 which which comes out to about nine and uh and and just since i've been here i mean when i got here we didn't even get Memorial Day
sw2706B-ms98-a-0081 474.985250 478.308000 and it it wasn't recognized here in the deep South [laughter]
sw2706B-ms98-a-0082 478.308000 491.409125 and we got uh uh and Good Friday came along i think uh in about nineteen seventy we got a chance to vote on it and we had to vote on on that versus the Friday after Thanksgiving because_1 we didn't get that day then
sw2706B-ms98-a-0083 491.409125 503.997500 and i always felt that it wasn't a religious motive that gave us Good Friday the the the employees voted for Good Friday it was just that New Years Day to Memorial Day was such a long stretch without a holiday it was nice to put one in there in the spring
sw2706B-ms98-a-0084 503.997500 507.701875 [silence]
sw2706B-ms98-a-0085 507.701875 509.494375 oh okay so you
sw2706B-ms98-a-0086 509.494375 511.997000 [silence]

sw2706B-ms98-a-0093 548.492125 558.976000 my goodness that's tough uh we had uh we've been with Aetna actually i think we fin[d]- fund our own insurance program Aetna just administers paying the bills
sw2706B-ms98-a-0094 558.976000 565.969500 yeah and and and the uh uh they started out with having Managed Mental Health Care
sw2706B-ms98-a-0095 565.969500 578.948125 and then they went to Managed Hospital Network where you had to go to a network hospital and we just got a notice the other day saying that uh that we're going to have uh uh network doctors
sw2706B-ms98-a-0096 578.948125 587.644125 and and they're going to the way they're going to work into this is they're going to look at the doctors that have been providing care for people
