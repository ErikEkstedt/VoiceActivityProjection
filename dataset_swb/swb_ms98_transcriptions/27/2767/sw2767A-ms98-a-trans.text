sw2767A-ms98-a-0018 46.324250 56.144625 and um you know just to jump ahead a little bit but then we can back up is it perhaps women in politics is for the future

sw2767A-ms98-a-0031 89.838375 91.619500 a government
sw2767A-ms98-a-0032 91.619500 94.602500 and i work in academia before
sw2767A-ms98-a-0033 94.602500 107.554500 and um actually there's one um woman in our i don't know what you'd call it uh institute who is a manager and i mean in a sense
sw2767A-ms98-a-0034 107.554500 110.241625 perhaps um
sw2767A-ms98-a-0035 110.241625 116.425750 a lot of she gets protected a lot because uh it's almost like a token
sw2767A-ms98-a-0036 116.425750 120.506500 and and it's sort of unfortunate
sw2767A-ms98-a-0037 120.506500 127.642750 because i think that they don't accept her technically and but she's a good paper pusher
sw2767A-ms98-a-0038 127.642750 131.202625 and it's in a technical position really
sw2767A-ms98-a-0039 131.202625 135.172375 and you know she should be more technical for what she does
sw2767A-ms98-a-0040 135.172375 140.672250 and i think that's sort of unfortunate because it doesn't it doesn't really help the cause in the [laughter-long] [laughter-run]

sw2767A-ms98-a-0042 142.353875 144.176000 um but um
sw2767A-ms98-a-0043 144.176000 150.949500 you know i don't know and and teaching i still see that that's where most of the women are
sw2767A-ms98-a-0044 150.949500 154.966625 in teaching and you know and it's always been that way
sw2767A-ms98-a-0045 154.966625 156.562000 [silence]
sw2767A-ms98-a-0046 156.562000 158.525375 right not well

sw2767A-ms98-a-0055 181.097875 188.653375 and do you think it's because women aren't qualified or or just don't or don't want the job or just aren't hired for the jobs

sw2767A-ms98-a-0069 218.719125 226.657500 oh okay but i'm wondering how many women actually major in engineering act[ually]- but you know i say that but yet i know two
sw2767A-ms98-a-0070 226.657500 228.970000 [silence]
sw2767A-ms98-a-0071 228.970000 231.157375 yeah i'm sure there are
sw2767A-ms98-a-0072 231.157375 232.691750 yeah
sw2767A-ms98-a-0073 232.691750 234.744875 [silence]
sw2767A-ms98-a-0074 234.744875 236.015000 um-hum
sw2767A-ms98-a-0075 236.015000 241.237625 yeah i mean the two that i know obviously are not in teaching but um
sw2767A-ms98-a-0076 241.237625 251.181750 it's it [vocalized-noise] i suppose in a since i was surprised when they told me they m[ajored]- majored in engineering i don't know why i but i don't know that many men that have majored in engineering either
sw2767A-ms98-a-0077 251.181750 254.592750 i mean it's just because i'm in the humanities it's just
sw2767A-ms98-a-0078 254.592750 259.193750 [laughter] you know it's not not something that i tend to hear about
sw2767A-ms98-a-0079 259.193750 261.277375 but um
sw2767A-ms98-a-0080 261.277375 263.008625 yeah it's uh
sw2767A-ms98-a-0081 263.008625 268.941625 [silence]
sw2767A-ms98-a-0082 268.941625 270.922750 oh that's interesting
sw2767A-ms98-a-0083 270.922750 272.360500 yeah
sw2767A-ms98-a-0084 272.360500 279.170250 yeah i mean i- i suppose that that it's difficult to really say why because
sw2767A-ms98-a-0085 279.170250 286.317750 you know there there probably are a limited number of women who are interested in the subject and well qualified
sw2767A-ms98-a-0086 286.317750 288.531250 and maybe there aren't you know
sw2767A-ms98-a-0087 288.531250 292.328125 [laughter] maybe they don't apply for the [laughter-job]
sw2767A-ms98-a-0088 292.328125 295.626750 [silence]
sw2767A-ms98-a-0089 295.626750 301.065750 right right which could be you know partial partially cultural anyway
sw2767A-ms98-a-0090 301.065750 302.282250 [silence]
sw2767A-ms98-a-0091 302.282250 315.232250 so that it might be circularly being the same problem of of expecting not to get hired for the good jobs anyway so why spend your time getting qualified
sw2767A-ms98-a-0092 315.232250 318.422750 it's a it's a rough [laughter]
sw2767A-ms98-a-0093 318.422750 321.075875 it's a rough a rough situation
sw2767A-ms98-a-0094 321.075875 322.731750 um
sw2767A-ms98-a-0095 322.731750 326.421875 and i guess what i what ama[zes]- amazes me is
sw2767A-ms98-a-0096 326.421875 339.538250 the number of men who are willing to stay home with the kids or and in our case we actually have one father who works part-time a six hour day so that he can take the kids
sw2767A-ms98-a-0097 339.538250 344.038625 kids or kid i'm not sure to school in the morning and be home
sw2767A-ms98-a-0098 344.038625 348.627000 when the children or child comes home in the afternoon
sw2767A-ms98-a-0099 348.627000 352.256875 [silence]
sw2767A-ms98-a-0100 352.256875 354.188875 this is uh
sw2767A-ms98-a-0101 354.188875 361.103875 well see i don't know anything about the family but but yeah i would imagine she might
sw2767A-ms98-a-0102 361.103875 362.940625 um because he's
sw2767A-ms98-a-0103 362.940625 375.588375 y[ou]- you know he's a really nice guy but he did say that because he was in the humanities and he's now working in more of a technical situation that he had trouble finding a job
sw2767A-ms98-a-0104 375.588375 386.422250 so that maybe he you know maybe she was more qualified but st[ill]- but still it's interesting that you know he he's been doing this evidently for a a good number of years
sw2767A-ms98-a-0105 386.422250 389.303125 and but it's unusual
sw2767A-ms98-a-0106 389.303125 396.354625 [silence]
sw2767A-ms98-a-0107 396.354625 397.932500 uh-huh
sw2767A-ms98-a-0108 397.932500 399.360750 yeah i
sw2767A-ms98-a-0109 399.360750 401.586625 [silence]
sw2767A-ms98-a-0110 401.586625 404.401875 oh he was even before they had children
sw2767A-ms98-a-0111 404.401875 405.471250 [silence]
sw2767A-ms98-a-0112 405.471250 408.684125 oh now that that really is [laughter]
sw2767A-ms98-a-0113 408.684125 410.033500 [silence]
sw2767A-ms98-a-0114 410.033500 411.529000 oh she was
sw2767A-ms98-a-0115 411.529000 412.760125 uh-huh
sw2767A-ms98-a-0116 412.760125 428.720000 [silence]
sw2767A-ms98-a-0117 428.720000 429.979125 uh-huh
sw2767A-ms98-a-0118 429.979125 436.311375 yeah i mean i think that would be it would it would strike one as strange if there's no reason for
sw2767A-ms98-a-0119 436.311375 438.795000 somebody to stay home that
sw2767A-ms98-a-0120 438.795000 439.830000 [silence]
sw2767A-ms98-a-0121 439.830000 442.817125 yeah [laughter-that's] [laughter-true]
sw2767A-ms98-a-0122 442.817125 448.785000 [silence]
sw2767A-ms98-a-0123 448.785000 452.070000 [laughter]
sw2767A-ms98-a-0124 452.070000 459.599625 but but yet you know we have to think about that because if if she had opted to stay home we wouldn't have thought anything stran[ge]-
sw2767A-ms98-a-0125 459.599625 460.611625 [silence]
sw2767A-ms98-a-0126 460.611625 463.871000 so so we're carrying our own prejudice
sw2767A-ms98-a-0127 463.871000 464.892250 [silence]
sw2767A-ms98-a-0128 464.892250 471.015875 [laughter] yeah oh gee [laughter] i guess we can't win [laughter]
sw2767A-ms98-a-0129 471.015875 472.019750 [silence]
sw2767A-ms98-a-0130 472.019750 477.730250 because yeah if if somebody does it and breaks tradition you're surprised but [laughter]
sw2767A-ms98-a-0131 477.730250 479.948500 [silence]
sw2767A-ms98-a-0132 479.948500 482.404625 oh dear so so
sw2767A-ms98-a-0133 482.404625 483.669125 [silence]
sw2767A-ms98-a-0134 483.669125 489.615750 [laughter-if] [laughter-they] could get away with it [laughter]
sw2767A-ms98-a-0135 489.615750 498.665500 oh dear you know well i mean it it's an interesting topic yet i must say it's not one that i've given a great deal of of thought to but um
sw2767A-ms98-a-0136 498.665500 501.311125 in the past it's um
sw2767A-ms98-a-0137 501.311125 505.094125 one of those things that you know seems to happen
sw2767A-ms98-a-0138 505.094125 506.362875 [silence]
sw2767A-ms98-a-0139 506.362875 511.171875 i don't i don't feel for the most part that i've been discriminated against
sw2767A-ms98-a-0140 511.171875 515.562500 no i was a department chairman i d[on't]- but i don't like administration
sw2767A-ms98-a-0141 515.562500 521.974250 so then i'm uh uh probably a poor example although you know i was an administrator and could still be i suppose
sw2767A-ms98-a-0142 521.974250 525.839125 [silence]
sw2767A-ms98-a-0143 525.839125 527.301125 uh-huh
sw2767A-ms98-a-0144 527.301125 528.634750 oh really
sw2767A-ms98-a-0145 528.634750 531.949500 you were you were more ambitious than they would let you be
sw2767A-ms98-a-0146 531.949500 534.977125 [silence]
sw2767A-ms98-a-0147 534.977125 536.245125 yeah
sw2767A-ms98-a-0148 536.245125 537.903500 yeah well i would
sw2767A-ms98-a-0149 537.903500 542.770875 [silence]
sw2767A-ms98-a-0150 542.770875 543.894500 uh
sw2767A-ms98-a-0151 543.894500 550.371125 [silence]
sw2767A-ms98-a-0152 550.371125 551.720000 oh jeez
sw2767A-ms98-a-0153 551.720000 559.535250 yeah actually in a since i suppose when i was hired into the government um at i was taken advantage of
sw2767A-ms98-a-0154 559.535250 565.975375 and and that's true that you know sometimes other people get get higher increments
sw2767A-ms98-a-0155 565.975375 568.648750 for you know even
sw2767A-ms98-a-0156 568.648750 570.572750 [silence]
sw2767A-ms98-a-0157 570.572750 571.854375 right
sw2767A-ms98-a-0158 571.854375 582.968750 right that's probably true i hadn't i hadn't thought about it because i do like what i do and i just sort of ignore the administrative part of it since i didn't like it when when i had to do it
sw2767A-ms98-a-0159 582.968750 594.775000 so i- i figure you know nobody must uh nobody must like it it must be a rotten job for everybody [laughter] but i know some people thrive on it [laughter]
sw2767A-ms98-a-0160 594.775000 596.244250 oh gee
sw2767A-ms98-a-0161 596.244250 597.620000 well
sw2767A-ms98-a-0162 597.620000 600.953250 since i don't have a whole lot more to say on the topic
