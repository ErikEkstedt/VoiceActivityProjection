sw2762B-ms98-a-0002 52.863875 61.370875 well yes you have an opportunity to [noise] to use a J O B system which is a job opportunity system it's most com[panies]- most big companies have that but
sw2762B-ms98-a-0003 61.370875 65.634250 well i think sometime that you get lost in that also
sw2762B-ms98-a-0004 65.634250 68.996375 i really do i i i sometimes think that
sw2762B-ms98-a-0005 68.996375 71.156125 a small company may offer
sw2762B-ms98-a-0006 71.156125 73.314000 [silence]
sw2762B-ms98-a-0007 73.314000 75.515125 well i'm not sure how to pu[t]- [laughter]
sw2762B-ms98-a-0008 75.515125 77.512500 i'm not sure how to put this but that's not
sw2762B-ms98-a-0009 77.512500 88.381000 uh perhaps better one on one uh relations a a big company sometime you can get lost you can you can uh opportunities do arise
sw2762B-ms98-a-0010 88.381000 91.533375 but the competition is much greater for that
sw2762B-ms98-a-0011 91.533375 93.309375 opportunity okay
sw2762B-ms98-a-0012 93.309375 108.571625 [silence]
sw2762B-ms98-a-0013 108.571625 120.753875 exactly i and i think you get a lot more support from your coworkers and and often times in a big company you are asked to go and do things in other areas that
sw2762B-ms98-a-0014 120.753875 128.598000 may not be your expertise okay but they require you to do this as their as your uh stepping stone or whatever you'd care to call it
sw2762B-ms98-a-0015 128.598000 137.506625 and and that can get to be sometimes very very disastrous wi[th]- the consequences of that because people do the best they can
sw2762B-ms98-a-0016 137.506625 140.071875 and often times it's not really what
sw2762B-ms98-a-0017 140.071875 143.052625 was aimed at in the first place if that makes sense
sw2762B-ms98-a-0018 143.052625 164.539000 [silence]
sw2762B-ms98-a-0019 164.539000 175.414500 yes i can i see that in my job because my particular job is of of a troubleshooting nature and i'm you know it's one of these put out fires things [noise] so
sw2762B-ms98-a-0020 175.414500 177.593750 i can see the results of that
sw2762B-ms98-a-0021 177.593750 179.394000 but um
sw2762B-ms98-a-0022 179.394000 189.822375 yes i i'm i i get a lot of gratification from my job bu[t]- some some folks i guess they go to work every day and they just go to work for a paycheck every every two weeks or every month or whatever
sw2762B-ms98-a-0023 189.822375 198.883750 but in my particular job i really enjoy it because i do have an opportunity to help other people do better okay and i really like that
sw2762B-ms98-a-0024 198.883750 205.565875 [silence]
sw2762B-ms98-a-0025 205.565875 206.208750 ye[s]-
sw2762B-ms98-a-0026 206.208750 213.352250 yeah i i i also teach school at at TI at uh Texas Instruments i'm a i'm an instructor there so
sw2762B-ms98-a-0027 213.352250 215.046375 i teach new
sw2762B-ms98-a-0028 215.046375 227.955875 well not new employees but all ye[ah]- all employee any employees really that that care to and we talked about the job opportunity system we have uh a system where we train people t[o]- to become what we call automation specialists
sw2762B-ms98-a-0029 227.955875 237.732875 and and it's a job where if you as a secretary you decide you want to be uh an automation specialist which is a much higher paying job and a much more technical job
sw2762B-ms98-a-0030 237.732875 241.265500 and then you would come to one of our in-house classes
sw2762B-ms98-a-0031 241.265500 243.723000 on on company time
sw2762B-ms98-a-0032 243.723000 254.338125 and and and or on overtime so we don't involve the the uh production process okay of of personnel coming to our classes and we set up and establish these
sw2762B-ms98-a-0033 254.338125 259.597625 sixteen and twenty week classes at at uh three hours a day twice a week
sw2762B-ms98-a-0034 259.597625 262.131375 for automation specialist training
sw2762B-ms98-a-0035 262.131375 267.349125 when you finish hopefully you've acquired enough knowledge to uh
sw2762B-ms98-a-0036 267.349125 271.678625 you know move on into advanced machinery type operations and
sw2762B-ms98-a-0037 271.678625 274.785375 and and that that's really gratifying to me i
sw2762B-ms98-a-0038 274.785375 281.767000 i see a lot of young folks come in and and gals and guys both and some gals that say i've n[o]- i don't know a hammer from a
sw2762B-ms98-a-0039 281.767000 291.319750 a nail or a wrench [laughter-i] [laughter-mean] you know and okay that's and that's where we'll start but and we have the other side of the coin where you have you know really advanced people
sw2762B-ms98-a-0040 291.319750 294.976375 coming in and and top notch uh
sw2762B-ms98-a-0041 294.976375 299.506125 mechanical type people and they want to do better so they of co[me]- they they jump right on it
sw2762B-ms98-a-0042 299.506125 312.996125 [silence]
sw2762B-ms98-a-0043 312.996125 314.953000 no that's a fact and
sw2762B-ms98-a-0044 314.953000 319.933875 [silence]
sw2762B-ms98-a-0045 319.933875 325.960625 and train and train them we sometimes we have to uh simply for for two reasons one 
sw2762B-ms98-a-0046 325.960625 335.478625 that we we are changing jobs constantly where we are changing our methods of doing things and we are finding more economical methods and more
sw2762B-ms98-a-0047 335.478625 342.767250 okay and the other thing is we cannot find the people outside to just walk in off the street and help us
sw2762B-ms98-a-0048 342.767250 344.111375 so
sw2762B-ms98-a-0049 344.111375 351.270875 but that would be the same in your type of secretarial job i'm that one time we the girls used to have just the typewriter and they
sw2762B-ms98-a-0050 351.270875 358.157125 and then they had word processors and now they've got full blown desk top publishers so you know
sw2762B-ms98-a-0051 358.157125 369.078250 it is i i'm that amazes me tha[t]- you know people say your job amazes me well my job is really nothing i sit there and i watch some little gal make me all kinds of charts and view foils and graphs and
sw2762B-ms98-a-0052 369.078250 380.329875 and it's i it's you know they use laser printers and all that and it's absolutely mind boggling uh because i could probably turn it on before i get the screen to go completely blank you know and i generally do that
sw2762B-ms98-a-0053 380.329875 383.900000 but i i was in the same situation i had to learn
sw2762B-ms98-a-0054 383.900000 387.709500 i i had no knowledge of a computer at all i'm a master
sw2762B-ms98-a-0055 387.709500 390.490625 mechanic but not a computer expert
sw2762B-ms98-a-0056 390.490625 395.908250 but now i'm in to Lotus and word processing and i can hold my own with that
sw2762B-ms98-a-0057 395.908250 397.476625 but um
sw2762B-ms98-a-0058 397.476625 401.165500 [silence]
sw2762B-ms98-a-0059 401.165500 402.870375 uh-huh
sw2762B-ms98-a-0060 402.870375 404.278750 yeah
sw2762B-ms98-a-0061 404.278750 420.460375 [silence]
sw2762B-ms98-a-0062 420.460375 428.699750 yeah i i i feel that way and it's a long time to get you know you work for many years with two weeks vacation per year
sw2762B-ms98-a-0063 428.699750 431.228000 and then if you have extra days out for
sw2762B-ms98-a-0064 431.228000 443.634250 what other reasons uh there may be uh an and we we try to deal on an individual basis with them but you can be penalized for that an and it it's penalized against your merit increases and et cetera
sw2762B-ms98-a-0065 443.634250 452.352875 so i mean you are allowed a certain number of days o[f]- what we call sick time and personal time off but if you you know if you extend beyond those
sw2762B-ms98-a-0066 452.352875 456.149750 an and at times we will adjust on a one to one basis
sw2762B-ms98-a-0067 456.149750 458.709750 for some unusual circumstances but
sw2762B-ms98-a-0068 458.709750 464.273125 to work for a company almost fifteen years with two weeks vacation it seems to me like an awful long time
sw2762B-ms98-a-0069 464.273125 466.897750 [silence]
sw2762B-ms98-a-0070 466.897750 469.690375 well no it well in some instances yes
sw2762B-ms98-a-0071 469.690375 475.693125 okay in some instances it would be we start with a a weeks vacation and then it's two weeks after a year or so
sw2762B-ms98-a-0072 475.693125 484.134875 but then that two weeks stays and then it goes to three weeks for a long long time and then after fifteen years it's four weeks
sw2762B-ms98-a-0073 484.134875 488.341500 but that's still that's a long time you know
sw2762B-ms98-a-0074 488.341500 496.367500 [silence]
sw2762B-ms98-a-0075 496.367500 498.619375 oh sure [vocalized-noise]
sw2762B-ms98-a-0076 498.619375 507.188000 [silence]
sw2762B-ms98-a-0077 507.188000 509.975250 i think uh i would like to see
sw2762B-ms98-a-0078 509.975250 512.285125 i would like to see more
sw2762B-ms98-a-0079 512.285125 513.780750 well
sw2762B-ms98-a-0080 513.780750 525.657000 it's like the kids were talking in California about going to school all year but they have breaks every ninety days or thirty days or ninety days or whatever it is they have two weeks off or a week off or someth[ing]-
sw2762B-ms98-a-0081 525.657000 527.841500 and they find that that's much
sw2762B-ms98-a-0082 527.841500 536.488375 better for them than having the whole summer off an where they're completely bored like the second month into i think i think industry re[ally]- would really
sw2762B-ms98-a-0083 536.488375 538.498250 benefit from that
sw2762B-ms98-a-0084 538.498250 548.193000 i'm not sure how we would accommodate all of our people being on vacation at all various times but we would always be shorthanded i guess but so that's a problem you know that's a problem pardon me
sw2762B-ms98-a-0085 548.193000 549.819500 [silence]
sw2762B-ms98-a-0086 549.819500 557.557625 well yes that's and that's exactly what we do in many instances you know where our work load increases an and our vacation periods and stuff
sw2762B-ms98-a-0087 557.557625 562.360875 of course we have uh what we called an SDS a Summer Development Student Program so
sw2762B-ms98-a-0088 562.360875 565.750500 we we put a lot of school um
sw2762B-ms98-a-0089 565.750500 566.719375 college
sw2762B-ms98-a-0090 566.719375 567.864750 [silence]
sw2762B-ms98-a-0091 567.864750 568.703125 pardon me
sw2762B-ms98-a-0092 568.703125 569.858625 [silence]
sw2762B-ms98-a-0093 569.858625 570.323500 yeah
sw2762B-ms98-a-0094 570.323500 574.554375 yeah they work for us and and they they go to school back in the Fall
sw2762B-ms98-a-0095 574.554375 578.773125 and hopefully when they get out of college they consider us to come on full-time
sw2762B-ms98-a-0096 578.773125 585.396000 and they've uh established themselves with a work pattern an and the you know they're familiar to our
sw2762B-ms98-a-0097 585.396000 589.372750 our ways and stuff and they're on our records and
sw2762B-ms98-a-0098 589.372750 591.712000 we find that that's very very helpful
sw2762B-ms98-a-0099 591.712000 596.739875 [silence]
sw2762B-ms98-a-0100 596.739875 599.579875 you sound uh like a very young person
sw2762B-ms98-a-0101 599.579875 600.344000 i
