sw2799A-ms98-a-0009 14.160500 23.990625 and let's see the question was what benefits you consider most important i think uh definitely medical and dental insurance
sw2799A-ms98-a-0010 23.990625 33.045750 um life insurance long-term disability uh [laughter-vacation]
sw2799A-ms98-a-0011 33.045750 35.404375 vacation [laughter]
sw2799A-ms98-a-0012 35.404375 37.258750 [silence]
sw2799A-ms98-a-0013 37.258750 40.718500 yeah and um
sw2799A-ms98-a-0014 40.718500 55.069250 i think what i don't like some of the policies that our company has that i don't like i don't like their sick leave policy their short-term disability policy and i would like to see them do something about um child care
sw2799A-ms98-a-0015 55.069250 57.287500 [silence]
sw2799A-ms98-a-0016 57.287500 63.930375 oh it's only like i don't know like six days a year which is way below the national average
sw2799A-ms98-a-0017 63.930375 65.591375 yeah
sw2799A-ms98-a-0018 65.591375 68.618750 [silence]
sw2799A-ms98-a-0019 68.618750 71.601750 no

sw2799A-ms98-a-0021 94.133625 96.308375 um-hum
sw2799A-ms98-a-0022 96.308375 106.575500 that's not even two days that's not even two days and what if you get the flu and you're sick for a [laughter-week] or two
sw2799A-ms98-a-0023 106.575500 108.742375 [silence]
sw2799A-ms98-a-0024 108.742375 111.016000 oh no

sw2799A-ms98-a-0029 124.257375 125.960000 [silence]
sw2799A-ms98-a-0030 125.960000 131.085000 no that's in fact [laughter] i wouldn't call that much of a benefit at all
sw2799A-ms98-a-0031 131.085000 139.943375 i think you know people get sick and if you get sick usually you're sick for more than a day and then you know if your children get sick
sw2799A-ms98-a-0032 139.943375 146.978125 uh you know parents have to take time off for that and um
sw2799A-ms98-a-0033 146.978125 149.602375 [silence]
sw2799A-ms98-a-0034 149.602375 151.176125 yeah

sw2799A-ms98-a-0036 152.431250 162.370250 and i think you know it varies from manager to manager some managers keep track of it and some managers don't and it's really unfair you know
sw2799A-ms98-a-0037 162.370250 164.331250 [silence]
sw2799A-ms98-a-0038 164.331250 177.782625 but i think you know at NCNB in any any work place [vocalized-noise] being a single parent i think that child care is my greatest expense and um
sw2799A-ms98-a-0039 177.782625 182.993375 you know it's it's getting to the point where you just can't afford it anymore
sw2799A-ms98-a-0040 182.993375 191.947750 [silence]
sw2799A-ms98-a-0041 191.947750 193.772375 um-hum

sw2799A-ms98-a-0049 219.689250 227.755750 and i think they should even do something for when children are sick you know provide facilities for sick children
sw2799A-ms98-a-0050 227.755750 235.899125 although i know that's not very comfortable for the children when they're sick they probably just would rather stay home but um
sw2799A-ms98-a-0051 235.899125 248.449000 you know [vocalized-noise] my options are you know to either call in sick to take to take him to one of those places that takes care of sick children um
sw2799A-ms98-a-0052 248.449000 262.146875 you know and that's about it you know a lot of times i don't have the option of staying home with[out]- you know i just can't you know there's something going on that day or you know that i have to be there for
sw2799A-ms98-a-0053 262.146875 263.250625 [silence]
sw2799A-ms98-a-0054 263.250625 271.487125 and i know a lot of um what i do like though is i see a lot of men taking off and they take turns with their wives
sw2799A-ms98-a-0055 271.487125 279.762625 you know staying home with the kids but that's still you know kids are sick a [laughter-lot] [laughter]

sw2799A-ms98-a-0062 295.877750 301.835250 i got that when i started because i was because i'm an officer of the company
sw2799A-ms98-a-0063 301.835250 316.692125 so it depends on if you're an if you're not an officer it depends on how long you've been there i think you get like a week your first year and then two weeks and then you have to be there like five years to get three weeks or four years
sw2799A-ms98-a-0064 316.692125 323.002375 and then officers just start out at three weeks and then they go up to four weeks
sw2799A-ms98-a-0065 323.002375 331.166625 depending on i'm real happy with the vacation i guess you know you could take vacation days if you had to stay home but

sw2799A-ms98-a-0118 522.463125 534.358125 well yeah because retirement plans now are so bad i don't know about your company but our company tries to keep base salaries low and they compensate employees more with bonuses
sw2799A-ms98-a-0119 534.358125 543.922500 and incentive pay rather than raises because it cuts down on their expenses for the pension plan because your pension's going to be based on what your salary was
sw2799A-ms98-a-0120 543.922500 551.510375 not what your salary plus bonuses where and your your bonuses cut ultimately end up being fifty percent of your salary
