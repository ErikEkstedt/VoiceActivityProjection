sw2799B-ms98-a-0015 32.529500 34.050375 what
sw2799B-ms98-a-0016 34.050375 38.180375 oh yeah don't ever think of those as a benefit but they sure are
sw2799B-ms98-a-0017 38.180375 53.990375 [silence]
sw2799B-ms98-a-0018 53.990375 58.225250 yeah what is their sick leave policy
sw2799B-ms98-a-0019 58.225250 62.715250 [silence]
sw2799B-ms98-a-0020 62.715250 64.150250 is it paid
sw2799B-ms98-a-0021 64.150250 65.932125 [silence]
sw2799B-ms98-a-0022 65.932125 68.470625 uh do you get penalized for taking it off
sw2799B-ms98-a-0023 68.470625 70.668125 [silence]
sw2799B-ms98-a-0024 70.668125 77.488500 the reason why i said is um TI uh the hourly employees
sw2799B-ms98-a-0025 77.488500 87.839000 um they have i'm not sure up to five years they have a certain number of days and after five years they have um unlimited uh personal time off but
sw2799B-ms98-a-0026 87.839000 99.609625 if they miss more than say ten point five hours in a three month period they get penalized for it so really they don't ever huh
sw2799B-ms98-a-0027 99.609625 100.547250 [silence]
sw2799B-ms98-a-0028 100.547250 101.969625 huh-uh
sw2799B-ms98-a-0029 101.969625 104.085125 [silence]
sw2799B-ms98-a-0030 104.085125 117.869750 the problem is with that is that we work eleven or we work twelve hour days so no one could even take off a day [vocalized-noise] for pay you know PTO um because they get penalized for it 
sw2799B-ms98-a-0031 117.869750 127.118375 and they lose their certification pay which is like fifty five cents an hour for three whole months so it's really not a very good benefit
sw2799B-ms98-a-0032 127.118375 138.767750 [silence]
sw2799B-ms98-a-0033 138.767750 140.248250 yeah
sw2799B-ms98-a-0034 140.248250 143.899750 [silence]
sw2799B-ms98-a-0035 143.899750 152.368375 yeah that's the biggest thing and people come to work sick but when their kids get sick it's like well i can't afford to take off but i have to
sw2799B-ms98-a-0036 152.368375 158.835750 [silence]
sw2799B-ms98-a-0037 158.835750 160.285125 uh-huh
sw2799B-ms98-a-0038 160.285125 165.518750 that's true it is it's not really uh consistent
sw2799B-ms98-a-0039 165.518750 181.794000 [silence]
sw2799B-ms98-a-0040 181.794000 196.091625 yeah i really wish that somebody i[n]- in big companies or any company would take a hint from like that movie Nine to Five did you see that where they had the child care right there on the
sw2799B-ms98-a-0041 196.091625 201.323750 that was so good and that would help the morale of parents i think so much
sw2799B-ms98-a-0042 201.323750 213.174875 because_1 i hate to see that i mean probably ninety percent of the people that work for me are single parents and they have to you know use child care at least for a couple hours a day
sw2799B-ms98-a-0043 213.174875 219.440625 so i don't know i- i really think a big company needs to take responsibility for that
sw2799B-ms98-a-0044 219.440625 224.132375 [silence]
sw2799B-ms98-a-0045 224.132375 225.266750 yeah

sw2799B-ms98-a-0070 332.583750 343.859500 TI isn't doing very well so like i'm i'm negative vacation because i've only worked there three years and i- i get five days every six months well
sw2799B-ms98-a-0071 343.859500 352.290625 every about two three months we shut down for a week because you know there's no demand for our product so
sw2799B-ms98-a-0072 352.290625 353.473375 [silence]
sw2799B-ms98-a-0073 353.473375 359.637000 yeah and so we've shut down six weeks a year whereas we used to only shut down two
sw2799B-ms98-a-0074 359.637000 361.670750 and so it's kind of hurt
sw2799B-ms98-a-0075 361.670750 364.004375 [silence]
sw2799B-ms98-a-0076 364.004375 365.200000 yeah
sw2799B-ms98-a-0077 365.200000 376.756625 and luckily my boss has maybe you know allowed me to work it off but a lot of people you know go in the hole and uh take you know weeks without pay and it's tough
sw2799B-ms98-a-0078 376.756625 378.193375 [silence]
sw2799B-ms98-a-0079 378.193375 383.264500 um i don't ever but the people that work for me do yeah
sw2799B-ms98-a-0080 383.264500 394.435375 i mainly the reason because i'm salary so i don't ever lose pay i mean i just go in debt for [laughter-vacation] so yeah
sw2799B-ms98-a-0081 394.435375 399.369875 [silence]
sw2799B-ms98-a-0082 399.369875 404.792375 um yeah mainly because i haven't had really had to use it much i mean
sw2799B-ms98-a-0083 404.792375 410.417750 yeah i have to pay for my husband which is kind of expensive for him i mean it's like
sw2799B-ms98-a-0084 410.417750 414.792000 [silence]
sw2799B-ms98-a-0085 414.792000 426.587500 so[rt]- sort of yeah um the reason why i don't know much is because i don't real uh i haven't really had to use like my medical i know they increased the deductible last year which kind of hurt
sw2799B-ms98-a-0086 426.587500 438.769875 and i don't know and after that they pay like eighty percent and the dentals the dental covers quite a bit but like i said i've never really been sick or anything so i've never had to use it
sw2799B-ms98-a-0087 438.769875 449.428500 [silence]
sw2799B-ms98-a-0088 449.428500 451.370375 um

sw2799B-ms98-a-0090 461.269500 463.820625 is that like match savings
sw2799B-ms98-a-0091 463.820625 466.551375 yeah it's fifty percent matched
sw2799B-ms98-a-0092 466.551375 468.028250 [silence]
sw2799B-ms98-a-0093 468.028250 475.027875 some companies i know are a hundred percent matched yeah like Harris Semiconductors in Florida

sw2799B-ms98-a-0098 481.819875 484.135625 ours is only up to four percent though

sw2799B-ms98-a-0100 485.647375 487.708125 [laughter-yeah]
sw2799B-ms98-a-0101 487.708125 500.800250 because_1 i mean i only put in like a real small amount because_1 it's four percent you know af[ter]- af[ter]- after that you put it in and you get like in[terest]- interest i mean i've saved quite a bit it's helped me a lot but
sw2799B-ms98-a-0102 500.800250 505.022125 you have to roll it over to an IRA if you ever quit
sw2799B-ms98-a-0103 505.022125 507.698750 but you know that's still a good deal
