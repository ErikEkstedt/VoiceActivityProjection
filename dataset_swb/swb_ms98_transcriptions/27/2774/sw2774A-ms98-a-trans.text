sw2774A-ms98-a-0003 14.671875 24.527000 uh and interesting enough this time we're changing the color which makes uh an addition uh we've [vocalized-noise] what does your most recent

sw2774A-ms98-a-0008 48.778875 63.371375 uh we went through a process of of uh home repairs on a on a rental house we had probably the most uh extensive and uh the interesting part of it was how much we learned about what we could do
sw2774A-ms98-a-0009 63.371375 71.802250 um didn't have very much money and so we had to to do it ourselves in a kind of a slow process but we learned how to do
sw2774A-ms98-a-0010 71.802250 77.329750 uh retile bathtubs and and um
sw2774A-ms98-a-0011 77.329750 81.381250 oh just all kinds of things that are kind of unusual
sw2774A-ms98-a-0012 81.381250 85.486750 [silence]
sw2774A-ms98-a-0013 85.486750 86.989250 ah

sw2774A-ms98-a-0020 109.986875 120.369250 that's awful um uh Howard and i were talking about home repair the other night in uh in connection with Scouting you got a Scouter uh coming up and uh
sw2774A-ms98-a-0021 120.369250 127.766250 uh i think it's neat for for young people to learn how to uh take care of their
sw2774A-ms98-a-0022 127.766250 137.395250 of of a household you know like uh fixing faucets and drippy faucets and putting in panes of glass and stuff like that
sw2774A-ms98-a-0023 137.395250 156.348500 [silence]
sw2774A-ms98-a-0024 156.348500 158.129250 um-hum
sw2774A-ms98-a-0025 158.129250 161.000625 [silence]
sw2774A-ms98-a-0026 161.000625 162.554750 [laughter]
sw2774A-ms98-a-0027 162.554750 167.271750 how did the how did the pa[neling]- paneling looks lots better do you do you like it better
sw2774A-ms98-a-0028 167.271750 168.822125 yeah
sw2774A-ms98-a-0029 168.822125 170.981375 yeah ye[ah]-
sw2774A-ms98-a-0030 170.981375 176.481875 [silence]
sw2774A-ms98-a-0031 176.481875 179.400750 yeah that's nice isn't it
sw2774A-ms98-a-0032 179.400750 184.730000 nice to have it come out to uh uh positive and look look good
sw2774A-ms98-a-0033 184.730000 197.406250 yeah well we have a lot that needs to be done we have uh we have uh carpeting and and uh we did have a a new uh floor put in our kitchen and um
sw2774A-ms98-a-0034 197.406250 201.297625 i have my mother living with us and so she was in a
sw2774A-ms98-a-0035 201.297625 214.563000 a room with a carpet and course she's quite aged she's ninety three now so that meant she had problems now and then and i[t]- it was really good to get the carpet out of there and put a a linoleum down so it was easier to clean and
sw2774A-ms98-a-0036 214.563000 220.464500 see where the dirt was and [laughter] so that was a really positive uh uh
sw2774A-ms98-a-0037 220.464500 227.865750 it was fairly expensive though i'm i was impressed i think that uh we we had somebody do it and and it was
sw2774A-ms98-a-0038 227.865750 233.582125 it seems to me like it's probably more expensive to put down linoleum almost than it is to put down carpet
sw2774A-ms98-a-0039 233.582125 238.186375 kind of depends on the on the quality of carpet i suppose but
sw2774A-ms98-a-0040 238.186375 245.769500 uh i[n]- in the case of the linoleum they have to rip up everything and and fix the floor so it's
sw2774A-ms98-a-0041 245.769500 252.356250 uh i don't know whatever but they have to put stuff on the floor and it's uh kind of a process so
sw2774A-ms98-a-0042 252.356250 260.373500 well it sounds like you've had some pretty good experiences with uh with uh um home repair
sw2774A-ms98-a-0043 260.373500 261.694375 [silence]
sw2774A-ms98-a-0044 261.694375 268.728750 yeah all right happy home repairing [laughter-okay] [laughter-bye-bye] [noise]
