sw2729A-ms98-a-0076 313.787625 317.831500 and took he's got a full a pure bred Golden Retriever
sw2729A-ms98-a-0077 317.831500 332.606750 and then i had uh the puppy a little tiny puppy and we went and took the two dogs up fishing and this they just they had a ball romping around and you know you can't get a Golden Retriever near water without it jumping in
sw2729A-ms98-a-0078 332.606750 342.238125 and uh this Golden Retriever jumped in the the really fast moving uh river current and uh
sw2729A-ms98-a-0079 342.238125 351.029875 well no actually he had no trouble at all he first jumped in and i he's he's just about a year old himself and never had really i don't think he'd swum before
sw2729A-ms98-a-0080 351.029875 354.142000 but he jumped in in the the river
sw2729A-ms98-a-0081 354.142000 361.981875 well the puppy jumped in the into some of the pools but not into the i was careful to keep her away from the
sw2729A-ms98-a-0082 361.981875 367.052625 the fast moving water because_1 if she fell in then i'd of been had to go in after her
sw2729A-ms98-a-0083 367.052625 371.680875 and up here the waters probably about forty degrees right now
sw2729A-ms98-a-0084 371.680875 377.289250 and i would not have been fun trying to retrieve her but uh
sw2729A-ms98-a-0085 377.289250 387.376375 this dog Dennis jumped in and got this look on his face like what do i do now [laughter] as he's floating down the river then finally discovered that he could swim and uh 
sw2729A-ms98-a-0086 387.376375 394.462375 actually paddled up against the current and uh made it back to the shore and climbed up and then he
sw2729A-ms98-a-0087 394.462375 400.579875 he jumped in again and he was swimming for quite a bit all afternoon he loved it
sw2729A-ms98-a-0088 400.579875 409.089000 Cocoa didn't think too much of it though she jumped in and then started screaming and uh made me pull her back out
sw2729A-ms98-a-0089 409.089000 415.498375 i pulled her out and uh then had to wrap her up in a sweatshirt because she was shivering so bad and
sw2729A-ms98-a-0090 415.498375 418.362625 so but she got over it
