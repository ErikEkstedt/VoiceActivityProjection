sw2746A-ms98-a-0002 3.507750 8.911125 well uh we have done some minor repairs we're getting the house ready to sell
sw2746A-ms98-a-0003 8.911125 17.733750 and but i mean i really minor kinds of things you know like painting the painting the the smudge marks and uh uh
sw2746A-ms98-a-0004 17.733750 21.394500 gosh we haven't done anything uh real major
sw2746A-ms98-a-0005 21.394500 28.258625 um did some gardening did some landscaping i don't know that that counts as home repair
sw2746A-ms98-a-0006 28.258625 29.935750 um
sw2746A-ms98-a-0007 29.935750 38.035250 i would guess so i think the last thing we really did was was uh we had some gutters put up um
sw2746A-ms98-a-0008 38.035250 45.501875 and uh that made a big difference in terms of i mean the water was coming off the roof and just destroying the lawn
sw2746A-ms98-a-0009 45.501875 52.390000 i we moved here f[rom]- uh from New England about uh three years ago
sw2746A-ms98-a-0010 52.390000 59.095750 and uh we weren't quite prepared for the kinds of rains that uh you can get down here and uh
sw2746A-ms98-a-0011 59.095750 62.972375 but the gutter the the uh gutters made a big difference
sw2746A-ms98-a-0012 62.972375 64.976750 how about you
sw2746A-ms98-a-0013 64.976750 72.236250 no it well we bought the house new and uh it was kind of the you know you get what you pay for
sw2746A-ms98-a-0014 72.236250 73.606625 [laughter]
sw2746A-ms98-a-0015 73.606625 76.699875 and uh we didn't invest in the gutters at the time
sw2746A-ms98-a-0016 76.699875 82.314500 [silence]
sw2746A-ms98-a-0017 82.314500 84.284375 no no
sw2746A-ms98-a-0018 84.284375 89.279375 definitely not in fact we still don't have them in the back yard yeah
sw2746A-ms98-a-0019 89.279375 90.524750 [silence]
sw2746A-ms98-a-0020 90.524750 91.829125 right [laughter]
sw2746A-ms98-a-0021 91.829125 96.951250 [silence]
sw2746A-ms98-a-0022 96.951250 98.353750 oh yeah
sw2746A-ms98-a-0023 98.353750 102.117625 [silence]
sw2746A-ms98-a-0024 102.117625 103.403625 yeah
sw2746A-ms98-a-0025 103.403625 114.931750 [silence]
sw2746A-ms98-a-0026 114.931750 116.263125 yeah
sw2746A-ms98-a-0027 116.263125 117.789375 i don't think you
sw2746A-ms98-a-0028 117.789375 122.128250 yeah that's it i don't think you ever you're ever completely done
sw2746A-ms98-a-0029 122.128250 130.060875 um i know we had there's a lot of things we would have done if we'd stayed here uh we could use a shed out in the back
sw2746A-ms98-a-0030 130.060875 138.116250 and uh need to build could u[se]- the kids could use some shelves in their rooms um
sw2746A-ms98-a-0031 138.116250 145.295375 but i don't think you know being a new home we wouldn't do any kind of major remodeling like redoing the kitchen or anything like that
sw2746A-ms98-a-0032 145.295375 148.987625 uh maybe in the new maybe in the new house [laughter]
sw2746A-ms98-a-0033 148.987625 151.691500 the next house uh
sw2746A-ms98-a-0034 151.691500 156.652125 well we're we're going to stay in the area uh and uh
sw2746A-ms98-a-0035 156.652125 165.186625 uh we just it it turns out that this house was much bigger and more expensive than than we wanted to to invest in
sw2746A-ms98-a-0036 165.186625 177.874500 and uh so we decided that uh instead of throwing all our mon[ey]- money into the house we'd uh we'd try to invest it a little better and uh that way uh uh uh 
sw2746A-ms98-a-0037 177.874500 186.134375 you know it's it's it's just doesn't make sense to be house poor in these economic times you know what i mean 
sw2746A-ms98-a-0038 186.134375 187.632500 [silence]
sw2746A-ms98-a-0039 187.632500 191.203000 it seems to be yeah it seems to be um
sw2746A-ms98-a-0040 191.203000 199.938125 the interest rates just went down i don't know i would imagine that's going to encourage more people to uh to look to buy a house
sw2746A-ms98-a-0041 199.938125 201.184000 um
sw2746A-ms98-a-0042 201.184000 203.022625 so uh
sw2746A-ms98-a-0043 203.022625 204.437250 well see
sw2746A-ms98-a-0044 204.437250 208.522625 [silence]
sw2746A-ms98-a-0045 208.522625 216.911750 i never had uh my wife uh parents did that they uh my wife's from New Hampshire
sw2746A-ms98-a-0046 216.911750 221.323625 and they bought this big old farm house
sw2746A-ms98-a-0047 221.323625 225.152250 which you know didn't even have indoor plumbing kind of thing
sw2746A-ms98-a-0048 225.152250 233.709500 and uh they converted the barn into a garage and built a couple of rooms above the barn
sw2746A-ms98-a-0049 233.709500 239.058875 and uh they did a lot of remodeling in that house and of course had plumbing put in [laughter]
sw2746A-ms98-a-0050 239.058875 248.815125 and in fact our our first a[partment]- well our second apartment was what they did was they took a corner of the house and converted it into an apartment
sw2746A-ms98-a-0051 248.815125 259.780875 and my wife's grandfather is just really handy with uh tools and and and as a handyman kind of thing In fact he built his own house from scratch
sw2746A-ms98-a-0052 259.780875 267.369875 and and the funny thing about it is you you know you ask him well where did you learn to do that and he says well i read it in a book
sw2746A-ms98-a-0053 267.369875 269.882750 [laughter] and so course course
sw2746A-ms98-a-0054 269.882750 276.944750 at the time that he lived that's when all the neighbors used to pitch in and help with that kind of thing and so
sw2746A-ms98-a-0055 276.944750 279.349000 i do too boy
sw2746A-ms98-a-0056 279.349000 281.709125 [silence]
sw2746A-ms98-a-0057 281.709125 289.846000 right yeah that would be uh and and he had it was a really nice house he did a really nice job but he he built an apartment for us
sw2746A-ms98-a-0058 289.846000 295.619000 built the whole kitchen and the whole thing i mean we had a a wh[ole]- whole uh uh
sw2746A-ms98-a-0059 295.619000 299.537625 self-contained apartment so uh and it was ni[ce]- nice
sw2746A-ms98-a-0060 299.537625 305.375375 i'm going to sneeze in a second [laughter] i'm going wonder how they're going to uh record that um
sw2746A-ms98-a-0061 305.375375 307.305250 they uh [laughter]
sw2746A-ms98-a-0062 307.305250 310.899875 have you it's uh pollen season i guess
sw2746A-ms98-a-0063 310.899875 318.208375 but uh what he did was this house is so big that now that he's retired and everything what they do is they have a home in Florida
sw2746A-ms98-a-0064 318.208375 327.730125 and he com[pleted]- and they in the Summer when it's just too hot to stay in Florida they go up to New Hampshire and he built himself an apartment in another corner of the house
sw2746A-ms98-a-0065 327.730125 335.690625 and he and his uh wife stay up there and then in the winter they go back to Florida and they live in a little trailer home in Florida
sw2746A-ms98-a-0066 335.690625 336.767375 [silence]
sw2746A-ms98-a-0067 336.767375 337.674125 yeah
sw2746A-ms98-a-0068 337.674125 339.106750 [silence]
sw2746A-ms98-a-0069 339.106750 340.970750 oh yeah
sw2746A-ms98-a-0070 340.970750 345.123625 yeah of course he's he built the shelves in the in the garage for me [laughter]
sw2746A-ms98-a-0071 345.123625 346.284875 [laughter]
sw2746A-ms98-a-0072 346.284875 348.215000 [silence]
sw2746A-ms98-a-0073 348.215000 354.987875 yeah yeah i'm sure he'd i'm sure he'd love to uh he he's getting a little impatient now because
sw2746A-ms98-a-0074 354.987875 364.433875 i guess he's uh in his early eighties now and uh he's still you know very active and uh but you know the hand's just not as steady as it used to be
sw2746A-ms98-a-0075 364.433875 369.784000 and drawing those lines they just don't seem to come out as straight as they used to and it frustrates him
sw2746A-ms98-a-0076 369.784000 380.889125 i mean this guy i mean i used to think it was amazing when he was in his sixties and seventies he used to climb out on the roof and do stuff and and uh i think if you didn't stop him he'd still do it today
sw2746A-ms98-a-0077 380.889125 382.739375 [laughter]
sw2746A-ms98-a-0078 382.739375 389.335250 [silence]
sw2746A-ms98-a-0079 389.335250 390.481125 yeah
sw2746A-ms98-a-0080 390.481125 391.566375 [silence]
sw2746A-ms98-a-0081 391.566375 398.123375 yeah it's a lot of fun um our first house uh a real small house
sw2746A-ms98-a-0082 398.123375 405.766250 and uh i i did you know a lot of little things there i put put up my own gutters there and uh
sw2746A-ms98-a-0083 405.766250 411.775625 the uh being that it was in New England uh it was one of these little houses that was all electric
sw2746A-ms98-a-0084 411.775625 418.467375 and uh and New Hampshire at the time had the highest utility costs in the country
sw2746A-ms98-a-0085 418.467375 424.692000 so I was I mean we were just paying incredible bills during the long cold Winters
sw2746A-ms98-a-0086 424.692000 437.442250 so i had a uh wood stove put in big old wood stove put in in the basement and i built and i uh put in uh registers in the floors and stuff
sw2746A-ms98-a-0087 437.442250 442.405625 and it was a small house so that wood stove heated up the whole house an[d]-
sw2746A-ms98-a-0088 442.405625 444.276375 [silence]
sw2746A-ms98-a-0089 444.276375 450.399000 oh yeah and uh the nice thing about up there is you know you could buy the wood pretty cheap
sw2746A-ms98-a-0090 450.399000 461.267625 in fact what you did was during the spring you'd order the wood when it was green and then by wintertime it had dried out and you could use it
sw2746A-ms98-a-0091 461.267625 463.946500 and you could get it really cheap when it was green
sw2746A-ms98-a-0092 463.946500 465.040875 [silence]
sw2746A-ms98-a-0093 465.040875 468.408375 so that was the trick where where where do you live
sw2746A-ms98-a-0094 468.408375 470.384500 [silence]
sw2746A-ms98-a-0095 470.384500 472.259375 oh okay

sw2746A-ms98-a-0102 486.483000 487.554625 [silence]
sw2746A-ms98-a-0103 487.554625 498.677000 yeah that i think that that's always fun and and you know you can save a lot of money if you buy buy one of these homes that need some fixing up so long as it doesn't have foundation problems
sw2746A-ms98-a-0104 498.677000 501.541625 and uh you can do a lot of nice stuff
sw2746A-ms98-a-0105 501.541625 508.050000 you can uh i mean it can really be your home because you've put your touch on it you know
sw2746A-ms98-a-0106 508.050000 512.323875 if that's that's that was the nice thing about having a house built
sw2746A-ms98-a-0107 512.323875 520.708625 was that you got to pick you know the the floor plan and you got to pick the color of the carpet and and all this kind of stuff
sw2746A-ms98-a-0108 520.708625 523.419250 but uh yeah that's fun
