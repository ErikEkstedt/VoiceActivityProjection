sw2720A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.682375 [noise]
sw2720A-ms98-a-0002 1.682375 11.311875 okay Michelle um could you give me a few ideas on what you think is wrong with our public school system
sw2720A-ms98-a-0003 11.311875 41.360625 [silence]
sw2720A-ms98-a-0004 41.360625 53.832500 yeah [noise] i'm not sure if that's if that's a condition of of the lack of interest of the parents or if that's a condition of the
sw2720A-ms98-a-0005 53.832500 56.585375 administrators in the school systems
sw2720A-ms98-a-0006 56.585375 59.652375 [silence]
sw2720A-ms98-a-0007 59.652375 70.258125 um [noise] i've got a brother-in-law that was was teaching in Connecticut down by the Navy base and they have a [noise] a a
sw2720A-ms98-a-0008 70.258125 76.655875 fairly a transient population you know they're um only stationed there for a short period of time so
sw2720A-ms98-a-0009 76.655875 90.199750 most of the kids never get to finish high school uh there one or two years and then they have to be they're shipped off some place else [noise] and he teaches uh [noise] he teaches English and he teaches uh shop
sw2720A-ms98-a-0010 90.199750 91.649875 [silence]
sw2720A-ms98-a-0011 91.649875 105.294875 and it got to a point where he said that the administrators were coming to him just about every year having him downgrade his English exams because too many students were failing them
sw2720A-ms98-a-0012 105.294875 107.674250 [silence]
sw2720A-ms98-a-0013 107.674250 116.280125 yeah so in that particular school system um that was that was one of the problems and
sw2720A-ms98-a-0014 116.280125 130.707750 i guess one of the reasons the administrators uh were were putting so much pressure on him was uh the parents were going to them saying you know my Johnny or my Mary is smarter than that and blah blah blah and they can't fail and so
sw2720A-ms98-a-0015 130.707750 138.906625 [silence]
sw2720A-ms98-a-0016 138.906625 141.207625 that's right [noise]
sw2720A-ms98-a-0017 141.207625 152.473500 [silence]
sw2720A-ms98-a-0018 152.473500 159.510125 um yeah because they uh they care it's something that they want to learn um
sw2720A-ms98-a-0019 159.510125 160.751750 [silence]
sw2720A-ms98-a-0020 160.751750 170.611500 i'm sure you're you're more uh fluent in other things the things that you're interested in than some other people too uh
sw2720A-ms98-a-0021 170.611500 179.806000 i've been out of school for a long time so you know when i went to school i it was in a rural area and they had like two grades in the same class
sw2720A-ms98-a-0022 179.806000 191.240500 so when you're i think it was uh [noise] first and second third and fourth were in the same classroom so when you went through the first grade
sw2720A-ms98-a-0023 191.240500 202.376250 and you graduated you went to the second grade you just moved to the second half of the class on the other side of the room i found looking back at it now that
sw2720A-ms98-a-0024 202.376250 213.772250 when i was in the second grade i knew just about everything that was there i had learned it from the first grade and the same thing with the fourth i had learned it so it's the amount of teaching you get i think uh
sw2720A-ms98-a-0025 213.772250 220.040000 [noise] um you're like a sponge when you're young you absorb just about everything that they can throw at you
sw2720A-ms98-a-0026 220.040000 221.530875 um
sw2720A-ms98-a-0027 221.530875 223.161375 [silence]
sw2720A-ms98-a-0028 223.161375 224.704250 today
sw2720A-ms98-a-0029 224.704250 229.161000 well you're you're closer to it now than i am um
sw2720A-ms98-a-0030 229.161000 231.505750 did you go to high school in Pennsylvania
sw2720A-ms98-a-0031 231.505750 234.994750 okay so that's you're you're native then
sw2720A-ms98-a-0032 234.994750 248.385375 to Pennsylvania so how was your high school did they have with the split out like some people were going to college so they took certain courses and some people were shop
sw2720A-ms98-a-0033 248.385375 263.442750 [silence]
sw2720A-ms98-a-0034 263.442750 264.942000 okay
sw2720A-ms98-a-0035 264.942000 268.194375 [silence]
sw2720A-ms98-a-0036 268.194375 269.604000 okay
sw2720A-ms98-a-0037 269.604000 279.431750 [silence]
sw2720A-ms98-a-0038 279.431750 281.531875 oh that was good yeah
sw2720A-ms98-a-0039 281.531875 290.870000 [silence]
sw2720A-ms98-a-0040 290.870000 293.042375 yeah [noise]
sw2720A-ms98-a-0041 293.042375 301.060875 [silence]
sw2720A-ms98-a-0042 301.060875 303.733875 yeah um
sw2720A-ms98-a-0043 303.733875 318.453625 and we were just the opposite up here um i took the same algebra class two years in a row same book same teacher and that's only because of our school system but as far as English um
sw2720A-ms98-a-0044 318.453625 324.728250 we had a professor that taught English which was very unusual for our school system so our English was
sw2720A-ms98-a-0045 324.728250 326.116750 [silence]
sw2720A-ms98-a-0046 326.116750 327.766625 probably better than
sw2720A-ms98-a-0047 327.766625 332.116625 than most of the other school systems in in the state
sw2720A-ms98-a-0048 332.116625 333.395750 [silence]
sw2720A-ms98-a-0049 333.395750 334.906375 um
sw2720A-ms98-a-0050 334.906375 345.582500 up here now we're finding that more and more parents of are pulling their children out of the school systems and they are tutoring them at home
sw2720A-ms98-a-0051 345.582500 358.886250 yeah i work with uh a couple of the people that i i work with you know share the same office are doing that they've pulled their children out and they get a much rounder education 
sw2720A-ms98-a-0052 358.886250 365.557750 um and why that is i don't know i think it's too much administration at the top
sw2720A-ms98-a-0053 365.557750 366.791500 [silence]
sw2720A-ms98-a-0054 366.791500 375.821250 also i don't know the level of the teachers today are they dedicated like they used to be years ago or is it just a [noise] it's just a job so they can get the summers off
sw2720A-ms98-a-0055 375.821250 377.493500 [silence]
sw2720A-ms98-a-0056 377.493500 379.386625 how about college [noise]
sw2720A-ms98-a-0057 379.386625 406.340250 [silence]
sw2720A-ms98-a-0058 406.340250 407.661250 hum
sw2720A-ms98-a-0059 407.661250 452.734750 [silence]
sw2720A-ms98-a-0060 452.734750 455.981875 that's incredible that's in[credible]-
sw2720A-ms98-a-0061 455.981875 464.735250 [silence]
sw2720A-ms98-a-0062 464.735250 473.252375 so when he files his lesson plans for the year he just he just drags out the old ones and just files them and nobody even looks at them and all that is fine and
sw2720A-ms98-a-0063 473.252375 475.206250 [silence]
sw2720A-ms98-a-0064 475.206250 482.542500 so he's getting away with it so is it is it his fault or is it his boss
sw2720A-ms98-a-0065 482.542500 486.527625 or the people that he has to respond to report to
sw2720A-ms98-a-0066 486.527625 492.434875 [silence]
sw2720A-ms98-a-0067 492.434875 493.888750 and who does that
sw2720A-ms98-a-0068 493.888750 500.800750 [silence]
sw2720A-ms98-a-0069 500.800750 504.579000 who does that go to though who does that evaluation form
sw2720A-ms98-a-0070 504.579000 517.371625 [silence]
sw2720A-ms98-a-0071 517.371625 520.497250 [laughter] that's what it sounds like
sw2720A-ms98-a-0072 520.497250 524.559875 [silence]
sw2720A-ms98-a-0073 524.559875 528.080000 do they do they ever publish any results um
sw2720A-ms98-a-0074 528.080000 530.449000 how about the student newspaper
sw2720A-ms98-a-0075 530.449000 532.594250 [silence]
sw2720A-ms98-a-0076 532.594250 543.661625 would it be wise to put an article in there say you know we're doing these evaluations and every year we're we're making the same evaluations but yet the administration's not looking at the evaluations
sw2720A-ms98-a-0077 543.661625 551.438125 [silence]
sw2720A-ms98-a-0078 551.438125 552.509375 yeah
sw2720A-ms98-a-0079 552.509375 557.142125 [silence]
sw2720A-ms98-a-0080 557.142125 559.159750 what do you think uh can be done
sw2720A-ms98-a-0081 559.159750 565.084500 [silence]
sw2720A-ms98-a-0082 565.084500 579.148000 as far as um well one other's things probably is i don't know if it happens down there but every time the contracts teachers' contracts come up it's just before school season starts and they all go on strike
sw2720A-ms98-a-0083 579.148000 582.581875 so they close the schools down until they get what they want
sw2720A-ms98-a-0084 582.581875 584.099500 [silence]
sw2720A-ms98-a-0085 584.099500 596.823625 what's the matter with the uh students doing the same thing say hey uh we're we want a quality education and we're not getting it let's go on strike you know then see what you're going to do it'll create a lot of headlines that's for sure
sw2720A-ms98-a-0086 596.823625 599.488000 [silence]
