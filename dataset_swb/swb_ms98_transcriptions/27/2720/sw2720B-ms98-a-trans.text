sw2720B-ms98-a-0004 24.156500 35.740125 oh i don't know lose interest like you know [vocalized-noise] before like they would really try and help you i think and i can see the difference from when i was in high school and my little brothers and sisters are in it now 
sw2720B-ms98-a-0005 35.740125 41.224750 where the teachers like they can't discipline you whenever you are you know so they just don't even care any more

sw2720B-ms98-a-0015 139.815750 152.555750 they are so far more advanced than we are and a lot of them even know their English grammar better than i do and they can't speak it as well but i mean to write it is probably better than the way i write it

sw2720B-ms98-a-0028 260.514000 274.347625 if you if you wanted to take them and you weren't going to college you still could they didn't limit it to just the people who wanted to college could take them um our math i think we were very strong in our math we were taking tests and our math
sw2720B-ms98-a-0029 274.347625 280.025500 was um placing like third and fourth in like the nation where you had to send them in

sw2720B-ms98-a-0031 290.640000 301.915125 i don't know if i'm just more math oriented but like even on my SAT's i scored two hundred more points on my math than i did in my English and to have that big of a spread is unreal

sw2720B-ms98-a-0045 379.549625 388.252750 i'm very disappointed with professors at college they're only required to be in their office five hours out of the entire week
sw2720B-ms98-a-0046 388.252750 391.327875 some of them only have two or three classes
sw2720B-ms98-a-0047 391.327875 400.191000 and at the most they probably spend five hours in their classes and five hours that they're required to be in their office that's ten hours a week they're probably making more
sw2720B-ms98-a-0048 400.191000 411.235750 i know they're making more than my father and he you know he's making like forty five thousand and a lot of them have like other part like i know a lot of the business majors and computer

sw2720B-ms98-a-0050 425.956375 439.591000 as i think they should be spending more time and too they they teach the same class year after year well i know one professor he comes up from Pittsburgh you know and he hasn't changed his tests
sw2720B-ms98-a-0051 439.591000 454.050500 or [vocalized-noise] even his you know presenting material in years you can get the notes off someone else and never go to class and just go for your midterm and final and as long as you study those notes from two years ago you're still going to do fine in his class
sw2720B-ms98-a-0052 454.050500 466.057250 and i- i- i don't think it i don't think it's right at all [laughter] just like you're not even teaching any more you don't care you're getting paid whether we show up or not i mean uh i- i just i'm very disappointed with the
