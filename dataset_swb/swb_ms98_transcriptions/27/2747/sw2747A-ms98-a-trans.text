sw2747A-ms98-a-0028 213.952625 215.902625 and that's [noise] right
sw2747A-ms98-a-0029 215.902625 216.949750 [silence]
sw2747A-ms98-a-0030 216.949750 220.148000 that's what we used to do too years ago we used to do the same thing
sw2747A-ms98-a-0031 220.148000 242.437625 [silence]
sw2747A-ms98-a-0032 242.437625 243.676000 yep [noise]
sw2747A-ms98-a-0033 243.676000 245.353500 yeah we do the same yeah
sw2747A-ms98-a-0034 245.353500 253.624250 [silence]
sw2747A-ms98-a-0035 253.624250 265.019625 yeah all the states around us Connecticut uh Massachusetts New Hampshire i think Vermont and Maine do it Rhode Island's the only state that doesn't put a nickel deposit on the bottles
sw2747A-ms98-a-0036 265.019625 266.440500 [silence]
sw2747A-ms98-a-0037 266.440500 279.761375 but every other state does so you don't you don't see any trash along the sides of the roads people that throw bottles away there's other people that come along with plastic bags and they pick them_1 up and and i guess they can make of a you know it's like working a part-time job
sw2747A-ms98-a-0038 279.761375 284.618125 uh it's all free just takes time and if you're retired and have nothing to do
sw2747A-ms98-a-0039 284.618125 285.789625 um
sw2747A-ms98-a-0040 285.789625 296.236000 [silence]
sw2747A-ms98-a-0041 296.236000 298.850250 oh just on the metal content
sw2747A-ms98-a-0042 298.850250 300.302500 yeah
sw2747A-ms98-a-0043 300.302500 301.588000 [silence]
sw2747A-ms98-a-0044 301.588000 302.842500 yeah
sw2747A-ms98-a-0045 302.842500 308.042125 [silence]
sw2747A-ms98-a-0046 308.042125 310.116750 to make it worth it yeah
sw2747A-ms98-a-0047 310.116750 316.715500 [silence]
sw2747A-ms98-a-0048 316.715500 319.084375 [laughter]
sw2747A-ms98-a-0049 319.084375 320.046625 yeah
sw2747A-ms98-a-0050 320.046625 326.249250 uh my wife and i both graduated from the University of Rhode Island their uh master gardener program
sw2747A-ms98-a-0051 326.249250 331.662875 i guess every state has has uh uh [noise] a land grant college
sw2747A-ms98-a-0052 331.662875 336.244375 uh would used to be Brown University now it's uh University of Rhode Island
sw2747A-ms98-a-0053 336.244375 339.601125 and what we learned down there is that uh [noise]
sw2747A-ms98-a-0054 339.601125 352.703000 fifty percent when you when you mow your lawn fifty percent of all the nutrients are in that top section of the grass and most people kind of rake it up or they catch it in the grass catcher and they throw it away
sw2747A-ms98-a-0055 352.703000 361.601875 if you if you mow properly and just let it lay in there you refertilize your own soil besides building up a base
sw2747A-ms98-a-0056 361.601875 365.293500 so that's what [noise] we've been doing that for the last couple of years
sw2747A-ms98-a-0057 365.293500 373.968125 and you don't have to worry about uh fertilizing which causes a lot of thatch and all that kind of stuff so there's more and more people too are aware of that up here
sw2747A-ms98-a-0058 373.968125 381.682625 and they're not going out for chemicals they're not going out for a lot of fertilizers and stuff so they're letting it you know uh
sw2747A-ms98-a-0059 381.682625 391.056250 [silence]
sw2747A-ms98-a-0060 391.056250 393.281625 oh so
sw2747A-ms98-a-0061 393.281625 396.550625 summertimes it cracks when it heats when it gets
sw2747A-ms98-a-0062 396.550625 398.369875 [silence]
sw2747A-ms98-a-0063 398.369875 401.234875 oh yeah [noise]
sw2747A-ms98-a-0064 401.234875 411.482000 i was watching uh [noise] i was watching the news this morning uh national news and they were talking about uh i guess they got a a recycling dump for tires that caught on fire
sw2747A-ms98-a-0065 411.482000 416.635875 but they were saying that uh California [noise] they recycle their their
sw2747A-ms98-a-0066 416.635875 430.297250 all the tires and make like a a some kind of a rubberized compound and they incorporate that with uh with uh tar and they use it on their roads and they say the roads last a lot longer
sw2747A-ms98-a-0067 430.297250 455.565750 [silence]
sw2747A-ms98-a-0068 455.565750 459.894250 [noise] oh for the steel belted that's right i didn't think about
sw2747A-ms98-a-0069 459.894250 461.010375 yeah
sw2747A-ms98-a-0070 461.010375 479.819500 [silence]
sw2747A-ms98-a-0071 479.819500 482.506500 yeah yeah
sw2747A-ms98-a-0072 482.506500 487.138250 there could be the one up here some place i'm not really sure um
sw2747A-ms98-a-0073 487.138250 493.392625 [silence]
sw2747A-ms98-a-0074 493.392625 494.048750 yeah
sw2747A-ms98-a-0075 494.048750 502.423625 [silence]
sw2747A-ms98-a-0076 502.423625 505.282000 [noise] oh that's right too yeah i didn't think of yeah
sw2747A-ms98-a-0077 505.282000 506.970750 [silence]
sw2747A-ms98-a-0078 506.970750 514.054000 yeah Connecticut was uh is in the process of building [noise] a a plant to burn tires to generate electricity
sw2747A-ms98-a-0079 514.054000 515.255250 [silence]
sw2747A-ms98-a-0080 515.255250 520.465750 so i guess that's kind of of a a recycling process
sw2747A-ms98-a-0081 520.465750 532.144375 the uh [noise] all the all the communities in Rhode Island eventually are going to go on this like the recycling that we have now it depends on on each individual municipality
sw2747A-ms98-a-0082 532.144375 538.554125 uh we went on it quite early because of the town fathers said yeah you know we think it's a good idea
sw2747A-ms98-a-0083 538.554125 548.490000 but the state i think by nineteen ninety three every every town in the state has to go on this recycling program so it's like a forced
sw2747A-ms98-a-0084 548.490000 549.502875 [silence]
sw2747A-ms98-a-0085 549.502875 551.687375 um which is good i think
sw2747A-ms98-a-0086 551.687375 560.728750 [silence]
sw2747A-ms98-a-0087 560.728750 563.190625 yeah well you guys got
sw2747A-ms98-a-0088 563.190625 579.291875 [silence]
sw2747A-ms98-a-0089 579.291875 582.600000 yeah Houston's probably as big as this whole state of Rhode Island
sw2747A-ms98-a-0090 582.600000 583.545250 [vocalized-noise]
sw2747A-ms98-a-0091 583.545250 590.799500 [silence]
