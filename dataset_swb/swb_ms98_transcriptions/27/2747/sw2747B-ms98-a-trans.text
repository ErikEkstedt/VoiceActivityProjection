sw2747B-ms98-a-0002 6.413750 14.825500 we have recently the city of Plano has started a a situation it's pretty much volunteer as far as separating
sw2747B-ms98-a-0003 14.825500 20.324875 oh paper and bottles and you know cans and that sort of thing
sw2747B-ms98-a-0004 20.324875 29.693750 and uh it's not exactly curbside yet they've got these little igloo like things sitting up in various parts of town where you can take that stuff in if you want to
sw2747B-ms98-a-0005 29.693750 44.601875 the biggest thing that they've done is uh for forever we had been on the plastic trash bag business where everything was just uh put in uh plastic bags then set out in the alley
sw2747B-ms98-a-0006 44.601875 54.270875 but uh they came through with these big green uh plastic dumpster kind of things uh where you put everything except lawn trash
sw2747B-ms98-a-0007 54.270875 57.321750 and then they [noise] they
sw2747B-ms98-a-0008 57.321750 69.427750 we got these uh paper sacks to put uh lawn debris and stuff in supposedly uh you know it can all be mulched at once the paper sack and everything
sw2747B-ms98-a-0009 69.427750 72.565125 only problem is you can't get anything in the paper sack [laughter]

sw2747B-ms98-a-0011 74.299250 80.915000 yeah they're too small on the top and they're they're smaller than most grass catchers and that sort of thing so
sw2747B-ms98-a-0012 80.915000 84.399500 they just started this uh oh maybe a month or two ago
sw2747B-ms98-a-0013 84.399500 86.262500 and uh
sw2747B-ms98-a-0014 86.262500 88.238500 they uh
sw2747B-ms98-a-0015 88.238500 97.375000 the local folks you know they're just starting to use them_1 now that the grass is starting to you know be cut and everything we're getting a lot of complaints about them_1 but

sw2747B-ms98-a-0037 200.356875 211.451250 uh kind of a a rural area of of west Texas and New Mexico where that just wasn't a problem matter of fact till recently we burned trash you know we had the big barrels out in in the alley
sw2747B-ms98-a-0038 211.451250 217.229875 and when it's filled up you just put a match to it and burned it well course that's that's almost unheard of anymore

sw2747B-ms98-a-0042 223.765625 229.837125 as far as what to uh to do to encourage recycling i guess a lot of states
sw2747B-ms98-a-0043 229.837125 238.063125 i have noticed on uh on Coke bottles and and whatnot we went i've got some relatives in Iowa
sw2747B-ms98-a-0044 238.063125 245.315375 and uh there's a big thing up there what is it nickel for every bottle or some such thing and you know people 
sw2747B-ms98-a-0045 245.315375 253.266125 people actively go out and and uh seek them you know i guess that's one way of doing it you know is to make it worthwhile

sw2747B-ms98-a-0054 287.452500 296.660875 people will go after aluminum cans and stuff down here because it's just uh there's not a per can value on them_1 but there is a

sw2747B-ms98-a-0056 297.669250 301.317125 just in the metal recycling itself i've
sw2747B-ms98-a-0057 301.317125 309.755250 i i'm not sure what it's what a can is worth now it's couple cents you know you've got to get quite a few of them_1 to really make it worthwhile but
sw2747B-ms98-a-0058 309.755250 320.230375 it turns out that uh on a [laughter] a Sunday morning after a Dallas Saturday night there's enough aluminum cans and stuff along the road to make it worthwhile yeah

sw2747B-ms98-a-0083 429.821000 442.900000 there was a thing in the local news here yesterday there's a little town down south of Fort Worth called Mansfield and there's some tire recycling outfit wants a permit down there they say out of every tire you can get a gall[on]- what amounts to a gallon of diesel fuel
sw2747B-ms98-a-0084 442.900000 454.080500 and like you say several pounds of this uh carbon black and uh material for for making roads and anymore there's a couple pounds of stainless steel
sw2747B-ms98-a-0085 454.080500 461.856000 in most of the uh the tires yeah because the steel belted tires and uh
sw2747B-ms98-a-0086 461.856000 470.960375 it's a totally gas fired operation they say there's no exhaust whatsoever you know most people think of tire yeah those burning tire uh
sw2747B-ms98-a-0087 470.960375 472.005750 [silence]
sw2747B-ms98-a-0088 472.005750 484.578750 see there was what was it Massachusetts i remember here a couple of years ago reading about one that had been on fire for [laughter] long period of time you know it just smolders and the black smoke pours out of it
sw2747B-ms98-a-0089 484.578750 485.149875 yeah

sw2747B-ms98-a-0091 487.438500 493.135875 over in Fort Worth they had one catch fire here a couple of years ago and they had an awful time putting it out
sw2747B-ms98-a-0092 493.135875 505.241500 but our big problem down here course is uh tires laying around down on the ground and stuff uh collect water and then of course that becomes mosquito breeding area and uh
sw2747B-ms98-a-0093 505.241500 507.927250 that can be a real [vocalized-noise]

sw2747B-ms98-a-0102 549.747750 563.651125 yeah what happens to us anyways as you can imagine in Texas you've got urban areas that are probably as compact or as you know densely populated as just about any place in the country but then
sw2747B-ms98-a-0103 563.651125 567.038375 then you run into uh areas you know they've
sw2747B-ms98-a-0104 567.038375 579.421750 we've got a statistic down here that they like to use you know you can take the population of the world and pack it in the state of Texas about the density of Houston and then you'd have the rest of the world to grow crops in because there wouldn't be any people in it
sw2747B-ms98-a-0105 579.421750 581.675125 [silence]

sw2747B-ms98-a-0108 589.034500 592.930875 and New Mexico too for that matter that are bigger than Rhode Island but uh
sw2747B-ms98-a-0109 592.930875 599.655625 we had a our [vocalized-noise] our government rep i'm in DSEG here
