sw2752A-ms98-a-0011 37.388625 42.056125 you do you really think cars contribute a lot now that they've taken lead out of gas

sw2752A-ms98-a-0017 66.985875 68.517000 um-hum
sw2752A-ms98-a-0018 68.517000 81.365625 i think a lot of it's industrial i also think uh that uh there is a certain amount that comes from automobiles but it's mostly from older automobiles i don't think the newer automobiles are as polluting uh frankly i think that uh
sw2752A-ms98-a-0019 81.365625 83.755750 i think that um
sw2752A-ms98-a-0020 83.755750 93.424875 uh if uh i- i- i heard a story a while back something effect that if they could just pay to get twenty percent or take all the cars off of the road that have been
sw2752A-ms98-a-0021 93.424875 104.134500 uh manufactured say before nineteen seventy five that they could cut the automobile pollution by over fifty percent just by getting rid of those cars that are still left remaining
sw2752A-ms98-a-0022 104.134500 105.727000 [silence]
sw2752A-ms98-a-0023 105.727000 111.862000 yeah fro[m]- from cars that is not f[rom]- not total but just from cars okay
sw2752A-ms98-a-0024 111.862000 118.362750 so that i think would be a tremendous help and i happen to drive an old model car because it's very economical and it just keeps getting uh
sw2752A-ms98-a-0025 118.362750 127.263750 gives me good service and i don't have an incentive to get rid of it long as it keeps running good and not costing me any money on the other hand i know it's a much more polluter than any of the newer model cars i have
sw2752A-ms98-a-0026 127.263750 133.581500 but [laughter-i] [laughter-don't] [laughter-have] [laughter-any] [laughter-incentive] to get out of it until it dies and uh that may be part of the problem al[so]-

sw2752A-ms98-a-0028 134.939375 136.730750 yeah

sw2752A-ms98-a-0030 137.813000 148.865625 yeah yeah oh uh yeah it's it's uh pretty heavy up here i think but i think it's mostly industrial is what i really uh believe is the the main problem and
sw2752A-ms98-a-0031 148.865625 151.164750 and uh
sw2752A-ms98-a-0032 151.164750 152.857125 [silence]
sw2752A-ms98-a-0033 152.857125 164.197000 and uh uh people uh i don't think are paying as close attention to it in this area as they frankly should i i we we seem to have a high uh cancer rate up here in Maryland
sw2752A-ms98-a-0034 164.197000 166.366125 yeah and uh
sw2752A-ms98-a-0035 166.366125 167.483500 [silence]
sw2752A-ms98-a-0036 167.483500 174.204375 well uh for instance breast cancer seems to be pretty rampant and uh i think of course prostrate cancer's sort of bad for everybody
sw2752A-ms98-a-0037 174.204375 184.569875 but uh th[is]- th[is]- this state was like uh second my wife's a registered nurse and i think this state was like second this year from the top in terms of uh cancer rate
sw2752A-ms98-a-0038 184.569875 198.555625 for just all kinds and i can't help but believe that's not partially caused from pollution i just don't know exactly what it necessarily is but i just can't believe this now we have a lot of pollution being caused by chlorof[luorocarbons]- uh fluorocarbons
sw2752A-ms98-a-0039 198.555625 212.033375 which is the like freon twelve and freon twenty two they use freon twenty two in air conditioning systems in houses and the like and heat pumps and they use freon twelve in car air conditioners and that's also what's causing our atmosphere to lose it's ozone layer
sw2752A-ms98-a-0040 212.033375 222.937500 and i can't help believe if it's sufficient enough to make the atmosphere lose it's ozone layer that it's not acting as a pollutant in our lungs also and having all kinds of effects an[d]-
sw2752A-ms98-a-0041 222.937500 224.613625 [silence]
sw2752A-ms98-a-0042 224.613625 238.117375 well they're working now i know DuPont and Dow and several other chemical companies are working uh feverishly to try to come up with a substitute for fluorocarbons and whoever does is gonna make a a mint because if they ever come up with a reasonable
sw2752A-ms98-a-0043 238.117375 242.452375 working agent in place of fluorocarbons then uh
sw2752A-ms98-a-0044 242.452375 243.995375 [silence]
sw2752A-ms98-a-0045 243.995375 247.370875 well they used to be but they made them_1 take it out of that
sw2752A-ms98-a-0046 247.370875 249.646250 [silence]
sw2752A-ms98-a-0047 249.646250 251.528250 right
sw2752A-ms98-a-0048 251.528250 256.489625 no they they they m[ade]- passed a law and made them_1 take fluorocarbons out of the aerosol containers
sw2752A-ms98-a-0049 256.489625 266.316500 and that was a move in the right direction we are doing some things to try to correct the problem but there are more things we could do and getting rid of old cars like i said is one way to help correct the problem
sw2752A-ms98-a-0050 266.316500 280.220750 uh uh just trying to i think be careful uh with the way you handle garbage i notice in this state i don't know if you're doing it in Texas yet or not but in this state we have special containers now we have to put all our cans and bottles and plastic pieces
sw2752A-ms98-a-0051 280.220750 283.499875 uh you know containers in yeah
sw2752A-ms98-a-0052 283.499875 287.964500 [silence]
sw2752A-ms98-a-0053 287.964500 296.211000 yeah well we are doing it pretty religiously in our group too but they uh in one of the counties here they're actually doing a trial program of having a trash police
sw2752A-ms98-a-0054 296.211000 310.398250 they have a lady that goes around like a meter maid and she spot checks people's trash and if they find a bottle or a can or anything like that in your [laughter-trash] they'll fine you fifty bucks i think the first time and two fifty the second time
sw2752A-ms98-a-0055 310.398250 318.450500 yeah you right you got to give people incentives and surprisingly enough just handling of trash uh can cut pollution
sw2752A-ms98-a-0056 318.450500 326.401375 uh from uh uh from just throwing it in a dump or or or or whatever else they used to do with it maybe used to burn it they've stopped that up here too
sw2752A-ms98-a-0057 326.401375 335.139750 but that that will cut pollution too because_1 you get a lot of out gassing from these things i think decaying and tr[ying]- and trying to for instance cans and bottles they never go away at all
sw2752A-ms98-a-0058 335.139750 340.932375 well on on the other had i don't guess they're polluting but plastic containers and the like uh they may be
sw2752A-ms98-a-0059 340.932375 343.010250 ah i'm not sure of that
sw2752A-ms98-a-0060 343.010250 346.617375 [silence]
sw2752A-ms98-a-0061 346.617375 360.205500 oh i think that's very important to do i i really think that uh trying to get along with your environment and help it out is a very very important thing and uh that can help to cut pollution i guess some i- i don't know how much
sw2752A-ms98-a-0062 360.205500 370.326125 trees actually act as filtering agents in terms of pulling various pollutants or chemicals out of the air i would hope that they would help some though that's for sure

sw2752A-ms98-a-0071 389.998250 395.111375 well that uh that i think may go on a lot
sw2752A-ms98-a-0072 395.111375 404.161750 and the primary reason i think it may go on a lot is just as you said somebody happened to stay up late night or something i don't think we have a adequate policing 
sw2752A-ms98-a-0073 404.161750 406.494500 uh esp[ecially]- particularly on industry
sw2752A-ms98-a-0074 406.494500 419.491625 uh we have good policing at least in this state and and uh several of the surrounding states and probably yours too of car pollutants because we have to go down uh once a year here in Maryland and get our car's exhaust systems checked for emissions content

sw2752A-ms98-a-0077 422.944125 429.657000 uh no we don't have a state inspection but anytime you sell a car or buy a car it has to be inspected in this state

sw2752A-ms98-a-0079 432.849625 443.900875 i don't know uh i[t]- that's something that you'd have to just check with your authorities but in this state we have to uh pay eight dollars and a half and go to a an emission station once a year
sw2752A-ms98-a-0080 443.900875 449.730750 and get everyone of our cars checked that are have been made starting in nineteen seventy three

sw2752A-ms98-a-0082 453.502500 459.651625 no no we don't have inspections like that now i'm in Maryland in Virginia they check that every two years i think
sw2752A-ms98-a-0083 459.651625 470.177875 and i think that's a good idea too not no[t]- not that it necessarily has anything to do with cutting pollution n[ecessarily]- necessarily but i think it's a good idea the emissions check though is required in Maryland and it's also required in Virginia
sw2752A-ms98-a-0084 470.177875 475.989625 uh a sister state to to this and that's that goes a long ways towards cutting pollutants
sw2752A-ms98-a-0085 475.989625 481.335125 [silence]
sw2752A-ms98-a-0086 481.335125 495.671875 um-hum well if they don't i would imagine in time they'll get along with i[t]- they'll get around to it and if they don't then that's something i would c[ertainly]- certainly uh uh suggest you'd be willing to uh um be for in terms of uh yeah yeah
sw2752A-ms98-a-0087 495.671875 503.736125 oh yeah i i agree now that's another area we hadn't even discussed and that is water pollution and various of the other types of uh
sw2752A-ms98-a-0088 503.736125 512.915875 of uh like food pollution i mean you you hardly ever hear hear anybody say anything about food pollution but i think there we have a pretty good handle on inspection of foods in this country so
sw2752A-ms98-a-0089 512.915875 519.137500 uh hopefully we're not ingesting too much in the way of uh pollutants in our food but water pollution uh
sw2752A-ms98-a-0090 519.137500 528.662500 i've worried uh especially the last few years about just how good the water supply we have in this country is for drinking and the like i know a lot more people are going to bottled water

sw2752A-ms98-a-0099 556.000625 567.029500 i'm absolutely for drinking water out of wells as long as you first of course have it checked because_1 it seems uh when i was a kid growing up down south uh i used to go out in the country where my grandparents were and we had a well with one of those draws that
sw2752A-ms98-a-0100 567.029500 573.489750 i forget what you call those things and and that was some of the best tasting water i mean i can still to this day taste that water
