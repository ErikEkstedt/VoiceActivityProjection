sw2730A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 4.496750 [silence]
sw2730A-ms98-a-0002 4.496750 8.803000 sure i used to cycle around the block two or [laughter]
sw2730A-ms98-a-0003 8.803000 10.816500 [laughter]
sw2730A-ms98-a-0004 10.816500 20.928000 [laughter] yeah i recycled once before no yes actually we do we have Berkeley is a very avant-garde recycling city
sw2730A-ms98-a-0005 20.928000 22.087875 [silence]
sw2730A-ms98-a-0006 22.087875 29.456000 yeah they they go around and they give you these boxes and you you fill these boxes up and you take them_1 out and they leave you know
sw2730A-ms98-a-0007 29.456000 40.246625 uh you leave them on the curbstone and every Thursday or some such day they come by and pick them up problem is you end up with these boxes in your home that 
sw2730A-ms98-a-0008 40.246625 53.250875 you know get pretty piled up with such things as glass and tin cans and newspapers and and and by the time you you manage to drag one downstairs you know it's
sw2730A-ms98-a-0009 53.250875 65.869250 it's work i- i- i just th[e]- th[e]- there there's got to be a better way of incorporating it you know somehow so that the manufacturers uh
sw2730A-ms98-a-0010 65.869250 70.261750 uh that there's an incentive to get it back to them 
sw2730A-ms98-a-0011 70.261750 111.384875 [silence]
sw2730A-ms98-a-0012 111.384875 126.331375 exactly you know wha[t]- what they uh oh another thing is that it th[e]- industry has got to get the mind set that what they'd do affects the uni[verse]- you know th[e]- affects the environment
sw2730A-ms98-a-0013 126.331375 133.796875 what they manufacture has got to be and the way it's packaged has got to take that into consideration
sw2730A-ms98-a-0014 133.796875 142.326625 but like here in Berkeley you can't buy anything from a fast-food place anything like that that's in styrofoam
sw2730A-ms98-a-0015 142.326625 144.113125 [silence]
sw2730A-ms98-a-0016 144.113125 150.007500 uh and you know it's it's supposedly [laughter-decomposes] i've heard some stories though [laughter-about] 
sw2730A-ms98-a-0017 150.007500 157.072125 that uh the thing that that lasts longest in in in a in a the the uh landfills 
sw2730A-ms98-a-0018 157.072125 163.438875 is not so much the diapers and the things that everyone's yelling about but it's the newspapers
sw2730A-ms98-a-0019 163.438875 177.085375 yeah and that's really strange you wouldn't think that but whenever you see you know they're usually uh wrapped real tight and bundled and under pressure themselves before they get put into the landfill so
sw2730A-ms98-a-0020 177.085375 180.965625 inner areas of them are are protected
sw2730A-ms98-a-0021 180.965625 183.207125 so they don't decompose
sw2730A-ms98-a-0022 183.207125 186.195875 isn't that you know you
sw2730A-ms98-a-0023 186.195875 193.579750 and all those thousands of trees that gets cut down and you think well geez well newspaper's pretty good because it will you know
sw2730A-ms98-a-0024 193.579750 207.422500 [silence]
sw2730A-ms98-a-0025 207.422500 210.268625 [laughter]
sw2730A-ms98-a-0026 210.268625 212.930625 [silence]
sw2730A-ms98-a-0027 212.930625 227.530875 indeed well you know there's got to be a fortune in that you know i've got all we've got to do is get together and figure out some way to to use these diapers in some useful product you know some some some
sw2730A-ms98-a-0028 227.530875 229.622125 [silence]
sw2730A-ms98-a-0029 229.622125 232.051750 well yeah yeah
sw2730A-ms98-a-0030 232.051750 236.229875 or or or or a compost brick uh you know
sw2730A-ms98-a-0031 236.229875 243.159875 you know build your next sky rise out of compost brick you know you'd see the little blue things flickering through it but
sw2730A-ms98-a-0032 243.159875 245.997000 i think that might give it a little added
sw2730A-ms98-a-0033 245.997000 248.834125 touch of something i'm not sure what
sw2730A-ms98-a-0034 248.834125 250.606500 [laughter]
sw2730A-ms98-a-0035 250.606500 253.998375 no but that so they're aware of it in Texas huh
sw2730A-ms98-a-0036 253.998375 271.778625 [silence]
sw2730A-ms98-a-0037 271.778625 276.589125 that makes my heart sore because the last time i was in Texas
sw2730A-ms98-a-0038 276.589125 287.168875 was on a hunting trip and i was there with a couple of buddies and we had filled up a couple of cans we're going down the road about eighty miles an hour and rolled down the window and just threw them out now
sw2730A-ms98-a-0039 287.168875 291.033875 [silence]
sw2730A-ms98-a-0040 291.033875 297.449875 uh i- i will have to say that the people i was there with were Texans
sw2730A-ms98-a-0041 297.449875 302.350625 i was visiting it was not my idea [laughter]
sw2730A-ms98-a-0042 302.350625 306.027250 [silence]
sw2730A-ms98-a-0043 306.027250 312.067375 well i- i understand that and i think that that that he's certainly contributed to that
sw2730A-ms98-a-0044 312.067375 314.529500 [silence]
sw2730A-ms98-a-0045 314.529500 322.747500 i want you to know you've taken a big load off my chest i've never been able to to confess that to anyone and now i've gotten to confess it
sw2730A-ms98-a-0046 322.747500 329.986375 [silence]
sw2730A-ms98-a-0047 329.986375 338.714875 well something's got to be done i tell you what i was just watching a a show the other night on on Antarctica uh
sw2730A-ms98-a-0048 338.714875 344.239000 and how they're wanting to make it a a uh
sw2730A-ms98-a-0049 344.239000 358.764375 an international park zone so that no one country you know gets down there and trashes it for mining rights or any other thing and um uh
sw2730A-ms98-a-0050 358.764375 372.783250 it just it just amazes me uh you know that that that there's so little left on this earth where there is that sort of thing and of course the only reason that that place is left is because the damn
sw2730A-ms98-a-0051 372.783250 378.495625 climate is so inhospitable that no one can live down there you know [noise] 
sw2730A-ms98-a-0052 378.495625 385.492375 [silence]
sw2730A-ms98-a-0053 385.492375 399.779375 yeah well they're they're doing it they you know they're they're learning and and it's inevitably doomed and spe[ck]- you know all they got to do is find one speck of platinum or one speck of gold or uranium and and
sw2730A-ms98-a-0054 399.779375 401.133375 [silence]
sw2730A-ms98-a-0055 401.133375 410.336500 well they not uh not absolutely for sure now there is some off offshore
sw2730A-ms98-a-0056 410.336500 417.811250 but as far as on the continent i don't think that anyone drilled a rig on the continent yet
sw2730A-ms98-a-0057 417.811250 421.028500 but uh in any event
sw2730A-ms98-a-0058 421.028500 433.420500 i think we all just sort of have to hunker down and do something about it but you know it's like we we we have all the needs that you know a civilized society has and i think that it's not
sw2730A-ms98-a-0059 433.420500 443.341000 all our responsibility to to do that i mean th[e]- the the manufacturers wou[ld]- would manufacture things in ways that were biodegradable and did not 
sw2730A-ms98-a-0060 443.341000 451.494500 damage the the the environment you know i think that it would be a plus for them and more people would buy more of those products
sw2730A-ms98-a-0061 451.494500 460.498125 [silence]
sw2730A-ms98-a-0062 460.498125 467.002250 yeah and i think that the people are ready to pay a little extra for that kind of marketing 
sw2730A-ms98-a-0063 467.002250 468.747750 [silence]
sw2730A-ms98-a-0064 468.747750 470.008125 yeah
sw2730A-ms98-a-0065 470.008125 478.363750 [silence]
sw2730A-ms98-a-0066 478.363750 488.636125 yeah well i- i know i'm willing i just uh you know it's just i- i have certain needs for certain things and uh you know i really can't help it how it is packaged
sw2730A-ms98-a-0067 488.636125 491.088125 i have the need for what's there
sw2730A-ms98-a-0068 491.088125 497.591375 [silence]
sw2730A-ms98-a-0069 497.591375 503.425375 found ways and i will switch immediately and i think probably the rest of the planet will too
sw2730A-ms98-a-0070 503.425375 506.528375 [silence]
sw2730A-ms98-a-0071 506.528375 510.509500 well listen it's been a pleasure talking with you Steve right
