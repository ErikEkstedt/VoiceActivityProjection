sw2710B-ms98-a-0002 1.252250 7.733375 i started when i was in college you know they always offer credit cards for college students
sw2710B-ms98-a-0003 7.733375 16.477375 so i went ahead and and accepted every one that i was offered because i knew it would be easier to go ahead and get them and establish credit early
sw2710B-ms98-a-0004 16.477375 21.489500 so i p[ack]- i pack around a lot of them but i only use a few of them
sw2710B-ms98-a-0005 21.489500 28.989625 [silence]
sw2710B-ms98-a-0006 28.989625 30.641625 yeah
sw2710B-ms98-a-0007 30.641625 38.496250 [silence]
sw2710B-ms98-a-0008 38.496250 44.260375 and they give you such high credit limits it's it's easy to get caught up
sw2710B-ms98-a-0009 44.260375 47.216875 in the minimum payment trap
sw2710B-ms98-a-0010 47.216875 65.165000 [silence]
sw2710B-ms98-a-0011 65.165000 73.228500 yeah i've got i've got two that i you know that usually i'll have a a balance on
sw2710B-ms98-a-0012 73.228500 84.263125 and then all of the others i just try to use kind of like you would an American Express card and and pay it off every month that way i feel like i'm getting you know a thirty day loan
sw2710B-ms98-a-0013 84.263125 93.530375 but i don't have to worry about you know running them up too high except at Christmas then they usually go then they usually get run up pretty [laughter-good]
sw2710B-ms98-a-0014 93.530375 105.481000 [silence]
sw2710B-ms98-a-0015 105.481000 106.700500 uh-huh

sw2710B-ms98-a-0021 121.007875 125.150875 now that's one that's i've never used my Visa for cash before
sw2710B-ms98-a-0022 125.150875 126.278250 [silence]
sw2710B-ms98-a-0023 126.278250 129.489625 can you use it like at a bank machine or
sw2710B-ms98-a-0024 129.489625 142.450375 [silence]
sw2710B-ms98-a-0025 142.450375 143.790000 yeah
sw2710B-ms98-a-0026 143.790000 146.738125 [silence]
sw2710B-ms98-a-0027 146.738125 148.479500 oh okay
sw2710B-ms98-a-0028 148.479500 154.989750 [silence]
sw2710B-ms98-a-0029 154.989750 156.494500 yeah
sw2710B-ms98-a-0030 156.494500 162.494875 [silence]
sw2710B-ms98-a-0031 162.494875 172.499500 now we got that's that's funny you said that because we got a credit card um my husband and i got credit cards in the mail one day that we hadn't even applied for
sw2710B-ms98-a-0032 172.499500 176.028750 then a couple of weeks later we got we got pin numbers
sw2710B-ms98-a-0033 176.028750 189.479625 and then we got a a bill saying you know uh the yearly fee it was like forty dollars and we we cut them_1 up and sent them back because we we hadn't even applied for them and we didn't want them
sw2710B-ms98-a-0034 189.479625 194.995625 but they they had just automatically approved us and sent them without even contacting us
sw2710B-ms98-a-0035 194.995625 200.286125 so i thought man i don't know if i trust this or not [laughter]
sw2710B-ms98-a-0036 200.286125 207.498250 [silence]
sw2710B-ms98-a-0037 207.498250 212.994375 it's like let's see if we can get her to run up her bills [laughter]
sw2710B-ms98-a-0038 212.994375 218.288125 but it's hard i mean it's it's tempting when you see something to say well i'll just charge it
sw2710B-ms98-a-0039 218.288125 230.981125 and sometimes i'll do that but usually i- i will try to pay everything off the next month or the ones that that usually have an outstanding balance all the time i'll i'll pay more than the minimum payment
sw2710B-ms98-a-0040 230.981125 235.467750 just i fee[l]- i feel like even that little bit helps
sw2710B-ms98-a-0041 235.467750 254.487375 [silence]
sw2710B-ms98-a-0042 254.487375 257.448375 i know it
sw2710B-ms98-a-0043 257.448375 262.487375 [silence]
sw2710B-ms98-a-0044 262.487375 264.989125 well i work for TI too
sw2710B-ms98-a-0045 264.989125 269.697125 and i think they're getting ready to to probably sell us out our division
sw2710B-ms98-a-0046 269.697125 270.743750 [silence]
sw2710B-ms98-a-0047 270.743750 273.343000 in Johnson City Tennessee
sw2710B-ms98-a-0048 273.343000 274.491250 yeah
sw2710B-ms98-a-0049 274.491250 276.293375 [silence]
sw2710B-ms98-a-0050 276.293375 279.769875 yeah they just they just announced that didn't they
sw2710B-ms98-a-0051 279.769875 284.984750 so i mean it's it's kind of a bad time to be a slave to your credit cards
sw2710B-ms98-a-0052 284.984750 286.483375 [laughter]
sw2710B-ms98-a-0053 286.483375 293.747625 [silence]
sw2710B-ms98-a-0054 293.747625 295.231625 uh-huh
sw2710B-ms98-a-0055 295.231625 316.476500 [silence]
sw2710B-ms98-a-0056 316.476500 318.191625 man
sw2710B-ms98-a-0057 318.191625 323.998500 [silence]
sw2710B-ms98-a-0058 323.998500 325.689750 yeah
sw2710B-ms98-a-0059 325.689750 340.493000 [silence]
sw2710B-ms98-a-0060 340.493000 342.482000 ooh
sw2710B-ms98-a-0061 342.482000 344.753375 didn't pay them
sw2710B-ms98-a-0062 344.753375 349.983000 [silence]
sw2710B-ms98-a-0063 349.983000 351.234875 man
sw2710B-ms98-a-0064 351.234875 352.720500 [silence]
sw2710B-ms98-a-0065 352.720500 354.770875 that's scary
sw2710B-ms98-a-0066 354.770875 361.704125 [silence]
sw2710B-ms98-a-0067 361.704125 363.983000 i didn't realize that
sw2710B-ms98-a-0068 363.983000 369.711125 [silence]
sw2710B-ms98-a-0069 369.711125 371.206500 yeah
sw2710B-ms98-a-0070 371.206500 375.248125 [silence]
sw2710B-ms98-a-0071 375.248125 377.482500 oh okay
sw2710B-ms98-a-0072 377.482500 385.479750 [silence]
sw2710B-ms98-a-0073 385.479750 389.701125 they don't they don't recognize any time difference do they
sw2710B-ms98-a-0074 389.701125 390.701125 [silence]
sw2710B-ms98-a-0075 390.701125 392.293500 ooh that's scary
sw2710B-ms98-a-0076 392.293500 393.308125 [laughter]
sw2710B-ms98-a-0077 393.308125 401.975250 [silence]
sw2710B-ms98-a-0078 401.975250 408.753500 that's something i never thought about getting you know checking with to see what what your credit report looked like
sw2710B-ms98-a-0079 408.753500 412.495375 [silence]
sw2710B-ms98-a-0080 412.495375 415.494500 might be worth it for peace of mind
sw2710B-ms98-a-0081 415.494500 430.481875 [silence]
sw2710B-ms98-a-0082 430.481875 431.996625 yeah
sw2710B-ms98-a-0083 431.996625 442.768625 [silence]
sw2710B-ms98-a-0084 442.768625 444.227375 really
sw2710B-ms98-a-0085 444.227375 456.020375 i think that Discover card has a good idea with you know giving you a little cash back incentive for each amount you you purchase as long as you don't go crazy trying to get cash back
sw2710B-ms98-a-0086 456.020375 458.996000 and since they don't have the yearly fee
sw2710B-ms98-a-0087 458.996000 461.290500 [silence]
sw2710B-ms98-a-0088 461.290500 470.495375 i don't know i've never i haven't gotten one just because it's i- i felt like with Visa and MasterCard and American Express you didn't need another one
sw2710B-ms98-a-0089 470.495375 476.261250 i would think it wouldn't be you know much more than the eighteen or nineteen percent everyone else charges
sw2710B-ms98-a-0090 476.261250 477.490125 [silence]
sw2710B-ms98-a-0091 477.490125 480.697250 so that that wouldn't be too bad
sw2710B-ms98-a-0092 480.697250 500.192625 [silence]
sw2710B-ms98-a-0093 500.192625 501.984250 yeah
sw2710B-ms98-a-0094 501.984250 507.242250 [silence]
sw2710B-ms98-a-0095 507.242250 508.489625 [laughter]
sw2710B-ms98-a-0096 508.489625 513.996000 [silence]
sw2710B-ms98-a-0097 513.996000 515.480250 holy cow
sw2710B-ms98-a-0098 515.480250 520.778250 [silence]
sw2710B-ms98-a-0099 520.778250 523.259250 definitely that's awful
sw2710B-ms98-a-0100 523.259250 528.498375 [silence]
sw2710B-ms98-a-0101 528.498375 533.993125 i mean there's no point in giving them any more money than we have to [laughter-so]
sw2710B-ms98-a-0102 533.993125 538.305750 [silence]
sw2710B-ms98-a-0103 538.305750 540.474000 well that's great
sw2710B-ms98-a-0104 540.474000 547.777875 [silence]
sw2710B-ms98-a-0105 547.777875 551.264875 i'll try to remember that one [laughter]
sw2710B-ms98-a-0106 551.264875 552.186500 [silence]
sw2710B-ms98-a-0107 552.186500 553.522875 oh
sw2710B-ms98-a-0108 553.522875 554.760500 [silence]
sw2710B-ms98-a-0109 554.760500 556.272875 well
sw2710B-ms98-a-0110 556.272875 558.612500 see i was trying to think if there was anything else
sw2710B-ms98-a-0111 558.612500 559.129250 [laughter]
sw2710B-ms98-a-0112 559.129250 559.713750 [noise]
sw2710B-ms98-a-0113 559.713750 560.774250 [silence]
sw2710B-ms98-a-0114 560.774250 561.631375 um
sw2710B-ms98-a-0115 561.631375 562.692250 [silence]
sw2710B-ms98-a-0116 562.692250 571.986500 so i guess the worst problem i ever had with with a credit card though was um i got a an item on my bill that i had never purchased
sw2710B-ms98-a-0117 571.986500 584.510125 i had ordered a sofa and had filled out the paperwork but they weren't supposed to process it until they delivered it and i changed my mind but then they went ahead and charged it on my account
sw2710B-ms98-a-0118 584.510125 588.268000 and it took me about eighteen months
sw2710B-ms98-a-0119 588.268000 592.280500 to get that all of that mess off of my account
sw2710B-ms98-a-0120 592.280500 593.504625 [silence]
sw2710B-ms98-a-0121 593.504625 597.740375 so that's that's probably the worst thing i've ever had happen with a credit card
sw2710B-ms98-a-0122 597.740375 599.448250 [silence]
