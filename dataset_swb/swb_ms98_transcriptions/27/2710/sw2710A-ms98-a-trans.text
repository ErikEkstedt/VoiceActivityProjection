sw2710A-ms98-a-0065 292.496125 296.496375 where i was a collector for um
sw2710A-ms98-a-0066 296.496375 299.276250 uh uh a jewelry company

sw2710A-ms98-a-0072 317.159250 319.246625 and uh
sw2710A-ms98-a-0073 319.246625 332.490875 there's just so many people that have bought jewelry which is really a luxury item and then they they just can't pay for it something something happens you know you hear so many stories listening to them like
sw2710A-ms98-a-0074 332.490875 339.446750 uh you know they lost their job or uh they they've signed for a friend
sw2710A-ms98-a-0075 339.446750 349.960625 you know they got it in their name but they got it for a friend and then the friend [laughter] wouldn't pay them_1 and now they're stuck with the bill and it's ruining their credit and
sw2710A-ms98-a-0076 349.960625 361.995125 [vocalized-noise] you really have to watch it this you know because_1 yeah because every every month all of these credit cards report to the credit bureau you know automatically m[ost]- most of them_1 do 
sw2710A-ms98-a-0077 361.995125 365.676875 yeah and if you if you're uh
sw2710A-ms98-a-0078 365.676875 377.499875 it's bad because if you you know your bill is due on the fifteenth then you're you're not past due until the fifteenth of the next month but
sw2710A-ms98-a-0079 377.499875 386.985375 you know if you if you pay one day after that fifteenth you're not one day late you're thirty [laughter-days] late

sw2710A-ms98-a-0082 390.489500 401.014125 right [laughter] and anyway we need to watch our credit reports and all that kind of
sw2710A-ms98-a-0083 401.014125 407.487625 [silence]
sw2710A-ms98-a-0084 407.487625 413.246625 um-hum well you know you you can do that i believe it costs about ten dollars

sw2710A-ms98-a-0088 425.714625 431.280125 and you by that day and you're thir[ty]- [vocalized-noise] thirty days is not real bad though anyway 
sw2710A-ms98-a-0089 431.280125 442.476125 if you've got a charge off on your credit re[port]- report or something like that that's when it really gets bad or something you haven't paid in sixty days or ninety days you know
sw2710A-ms98-a-0090 442.476125 444.475375 things like that

sw2710A-ms98-a-0103 492.984875 496.166000 i know i had a charge with uh Spiegel
sw2710A-ms98-a-0104 496.166000 507.999750 [laughter] and i hadn't read the uh terms of the credit agreement really and uh when i did i you know i realized that that it just looked seemed like i was never paying the balance
sw2710A-ms98-a-0105 507.999750 511.740750 off you know and i looked at the credit card agreement one day
sw2710A-ms98-a-0106 511.740750 514.981875 and it was like twenty three percent interest
sw2710A-ms98-a-0107 514.981875 516.977375 [laughter]
sw2710A-ms98-a-0108 516.977375 528.194500 and that's the one bill that i hurry up hurried and paid up and and i've always watched it since then you really have to watch those interest rates

sw2710A-ms98-a-0110 531.462750 542.014625 that's true [laughter] so anyway they can't bill you any higher than eighteen percent i think in in Texas but there there are a couple of states that can
sw2710A-ms98-a-0111 542.014625 550.186250 and one to watch out for is anybody that bills you out of Atlanta [laughter] Atlanta Georgia [laughter]
