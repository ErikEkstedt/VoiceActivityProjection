sw2777B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 4.329250 [silence]
sw2777B-ms98-a-0002 4.329250 8.281625 well i guess i've uh just
sw2777B-ms98-a-0003 8.281625 18.904750 i've listened a lot to the media and i've tried to read some things on it and i've tried to take some steps to uh understand it and figure out where i am in the whole mess
sw2777B-ms98-a-0004 18.904750 28.777500 um apparently it's getting worse i mean i can tell that just by driving in Dallas you have the low f[lying]- flying gray cloud on certain days but
sw2777B-ms98-a-0005 28.777500 35.716375 you know it really gets to you in terms of being able to breathe and and and things like that so we know that
sw2777B-ms98-a-0006 35.716375 42.030250 if you do the same thing to like your plants and you don't let them breathe they kind of die on you
sw2777B-ms98-a-0007 42.030250 53.001500 um and so you know looking at the different areas that um cause air pollution um i guess we have industry for one
sw2777B-ms98-a-0008 53.001500 64.807750 um that has to be i guess a little bit more aware of you know the output and uh harmful chemicals and things that they use um what do you think about that
sw2777B-ms98-a-0009 64.807750 75.946500 [silence]
sw2777B-ms98-a-0010 75.946500 77.699250 oh right

sw2777B-ms98-a-0022 182.864125 195.032375 well that's true i think you know we we had such i mean i'm i'm close to forty and i can remember the good old days when we didn't have to worry about all this stuff and life was pretty you know
sw2777B-ms98-a-0023 195.032375 207.274875 um complacent in these areas and uh i think you're right though that we not only pay the price in money we're going to pay the price in our health and our f[uture]- you know in the future of whatever's going to happen here
sw2777B-ms98-a-0024 207.274875 213.663875 and you know it takes a few people you know on the alert to uh
sw2777B-ms98-a-0025 213.663875 222.351500 um really make a change and make a difference in the way people think and you're right about the education it's just got to be little by little by little
sw2777B-ms98-a-0026 222.351500 226.990000 until people become aware but i think we've got sort of a snowball effect going on now and
sw2777B-ms98-a-0027 226.990000 234.152500 i think that you know in terms of air pollution we're um pinpointing certain you know industries in our own communities
sw2777B-ms98-a-0028 234.152500 239.698875 that are you know blatantly um abusing the [laughter-airspace]
sw2777B-ms98-a-0029 239.698875 245.911125 and i think we're beginning to make them aware that um you know it's not just the
sw2777B-ms98-a-0030 245.911125 255.632000 a financial bottom line that they have to look at it's you know um it has a a bigger impact on the on the whole environment and the whole area
sw2777B-ms98-a-0031 255.632000 266.445375 and gosh i i don't know you know health seems to get in in the act too you know your your health and your lungs and and all this i mean this comes down to smokers
sw2777B-ms98-a-0032 266.445375 278.104500 and i don't know what to do about smokers because you know that's sort of an infringement of they're rights see you can go overboard too you can be real radical about this and i'm not for that i'm for
sw2777B-ms98-a-0033 278.104500 288.432875 persuading people by the use of education and by demonstration and by um you know your example of how things go
sw2777B-ms98-a-0034 288.432875 298.188875 um and you know i know there's some real radicals out there and and that that'll tend to turn you off anytime and think that they're you know full of baloney and they're not
sw2777B-ms98-a-0035 298.188875 301.785875 you know [laughter] on the right planet [laughter-sometimes]
sw2777B-ms98-a-0036 301.785875 303.830875 but you know what i mean about that
sw2777B-ms98-a-0037 303.830875 308.600250 think it's education like you said that really needs to and it starts with you 
sw2777B-ms98-a-0038 308.600250 311.710125 like you said just tell them_1 to you know
sw2777B-ms98-a-0039 311.710125 320.323250 wha[t]- why you're doing why you're collecting cans and why you're collecting glass and why you're recycling the stuff and gosh

sw2777B-ms98-a-0047 388.931125 395.181125 well ge[t]- it's yeah it's hard it's really hard and they have to maybe sort of like
sw2777B-ms98-a-0048 395.181125 404.108625 like hit bottom like they either have to die or they have to be you know totally incapacitated before they change their mind and you know
sw2777B-ms98-a-0049 404.108625 412.250125 bless their hearts you can't do anything that will impact them or or you you can't find a way really that it's
sw2777B-ms98-a-0050 412.250125 421.884000 it's it's almost like you know you can talk about alcoholism too i mean you know in this hidden in this manner sometimes i think that it's just a person has to change their mind
sw2777B-ms98-a-0051 421.884000 425.111000 and uh it's tough but um
sw2777B-ms98-a-0052 425.111000 434.717875 you know it it i don't allow people to smoke in my house and i i hope they respect that and you know i i send [laughter-them] [laughter-outside]
sw2777B-ms98-a-0053 434.717875 440.320000 sort of thing and and they respect that or else they just don't come back they don't smoke in my car
sw2777B-ms98-a-0054 440.320000 445.553125 and you know and it's not getting to be a big deal anymore i [laughter]
sw2777B-ms98-a-0055 445.553125 459.463375 you know they they seem to uh understand or at least have a little bit of respect for your wishes and and they don't just necessarily light up and and uh you know not expect to get some flack these [laughter-days]

sw2777B-ms98-a-0067 524.106625 533.427000 and you know we're left with a mess in a lot of ways you know caused by um starting with the air pollution and
sw2777B-ms98-a-0068 533.427000 540.326375 and that's just one of the factors that goes into you know trying to get this place cleaned up but
