sw2777A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 4.355625 all right Betty uh what do you think about air pollution what all you know about it

sw2777A-ms98-a-0010 42.002375 64.096750 [silence]
sw2777A-ms98-a-0011 64.096750 72.715750 well i think it's very true uh they're a lot of companies that don't have much regard for the environment they're
sw2777A-ms98-a-0012 72.715750 78.196375 primary goal is to produce a product as cheaply as they can and uh
sw2777A-ms98-a-0013 78.196375 84.209000 you know some environmental standards like a filters on smokestacks et cetera are quite expensive
sw2777A-ms98-a-0014 84.209000 89.430500 and they just don't want to sink the money into it unless someone clamps down on them_1 makes them_1 do it
sw2777A-ms98-a-0015 89.430500 98.107875 and dumping chemicals et cetera and all that you know they're just looking for the easy way out which you know i guess
sw2777A-ms98-a-0016 98.107875 105.004375 they're very shortsighted and they only look at what interests them and so i guess
sw2777A-ms98-a-0017 105.004375 112.870500 sort of you g[ot]- you got to blame them_1 but you understand what they're why they don't do it you just have to educate these people
sw2777A-ms98-a-0018 112.870500 124.452500 to what they're actually doing show them like this is what your plant is doing and we as consumers have to be prepared to pay a higher cost for the product
sw2777A-ms98-a-0019 124.452500 126.240250 which probably
sw2777A-ms98-a-0020 126.240250 130.888125 stops a lot of people from getting involved in the environmental issues
sw2777A-ms98-a-0021 130.888125 134.784750 you know they besides sinking their own time into it is
sw2777A-ms98-a-0022 134.784750 146.785250 that when we police these companies you know they say well look we're having to pay two million to put this filter device on it you're going to pay an extra thirty cents at the store for uh whatever
sw2777A-ms98-a-0023 146.785250 154.443500 and we're like oh no you know that's a s[o]- but and recycling i'm big on recycling and uh
sw2777A-ms98-a-0024 154.443500 163.194625 but you know a lot of people aren't i mean people i know that are ju[st]- you know they're good people and they know i go you don't recycle that uh no
sw2777A-ms98-a-0025 163.194625 173.237875 like well just stick it in a different bag you know like aluminum cans like if i if i give you a bag and you stick the cans in there will you give them_1 to me oh yeah i'll do so you know i'll
sw2777A-ms98-a-0026 173.237875 179.912375 i'm going to work on doing that a little bit more to people that you know they just aren't
sw2777A-ms98-a-0027 179.912375 185.095750 they're just not either not aware or they just don't think about it

sw2777A-ms98-a-0043 319.824500 326.629250 it just seems though um i guess we could talk about smoking because_1 it is a form of air pollution and uh
sw2777A-ms98-a-0044 326.629250 327.693375 [silence]
sw2777A-ms98-a-0045 327.693375 335.914625 oh my my father passed away at the age of fifty of a coronary artery disease and he had smoked
sw2777A-ms98-a-0046 335.914625 340.911750 you know pretty heavily since he went in the Army at like age eighteen
sw2777A-ms98-a-0047 340.911750 351.133000 and you know i've been fairly well educated on that subject and and i feel that uh you know that was a primary factor that caused his premature death
sw2777A-ms98-a-0048 351.133000 358.688125 so i'm sort of on a band wagon to say about the s[moking]- the adverse affects of smoking
sw2777A-ms98-a-0049 358.688125 368.802625 and i just wonder you know all the time when i was a little kid breathing the smo[ke]- secondhand smoke which people say is just as bad or even w[orse]- worse
sw2777A-ms98-a-0050 368.802625 378.249250 than what the smoker gets through the filter you know what affect that had on me for a coronary artery disease when i was younger but
sw2777A-ms98-a-0051 378.249250 385.539375 you know i i don't think i'm what you would call a a radical but it just seems that people that smoke
sw2777A-ms98-a-0052 385.539375 387.049750 you just don't
sw2777A-ms98-a-0053 387.049750 388.871375 they just don't listen
sw2777A-ms98-a-0054 388.871375 397.910125 [silence]
sw2777A-ms98-a-0055 397.910125 399.028125 [laughter]

sw2777A-ms98-a-0059 421.139375 422.031750 yeah

sw2777A-ms98-a-0067 445.912875 446.639875 yeah
sw2777A-ms98-a-0068 446.639875 458.385625 [silence]
sw2777A-ms98-a-0069 458.385625 461.650375 yeah so i guess the education has
sw2777A-ms98-a-0070 461.650375 471.016000 sunk in a little bit as to not you know as to respect an[other]- another person's clean air in that respect
sw2777A-ms98-a-0071 471.016000 472.227125 but
sw2777A-ms98-a-0072 472.227125 473.413000 um
sw2777A-ms98-a-0073 473.413000 478.728875 i had an uncle that had quadruple bypass surgery and was near death many times
sw2777A-ms98-a-0074 478.728875 483.431875 and he's kn[ow]- you know they've told him for years to quit smoking and he still smokes you know
sw2777A-ms98-a-0075 483.431875 485.338000 you know some people are just
sw2777A-ms98-a-0076 485.338000 498.382375 but he's he's good and then he came to visit and he would run outside to smoke instead of smoking in the house so you know i have to say well i guess if you're going to do it do it out there and don't
sw2777A-ms98-a-0077 498.382375 500.216750 [silence]
sw2777A-ms98-a-0078 500.216750 502.227125 right that's cool
sw2777A-ms98-a-0079 502.227125 515.846750 [silence]
sw2777A-ms98-a-0080 515.846750 516.967250 [laughter]

sw2777A-ms98-a-0082 520.888625 522.074375 um-hum
sw2777A-ms98-a-0083 522.074375 540.074750 [silence]
sw2777A-ms98-a-0084 540.074750 547.742875 yeah if you notice uh i'm from Indiana and we really gauge the weather the winters by how much snow we get
sw2777A-ms98-a-0085 547.742875 548.760125 [silence]
sw2777A-ms98-a-0086 548.760125 551.102250 so uh
sw2777A-ms98-a-0087 551.102250 560.673125 it's when i was growing up you always could expect some snowfall [vocalized-noise] twenty four even up to we had thirty eight inches of snow one time
sw2777A-ms98-a-0088 560.673125 564.287875 but the last few years we've barely gotten any snow at all
sw2777A-ms98-a-0089 564.287875 569.155000 yeah it's you know maybe there'll be six inches on the ground at one time
sw2777A-ms98-a-0090 569.155000 579.758000 and it'll blow for a while and then it'll all melt away it's just like they kept talking about this you know the global warming the greenhouse effect and all that well i can just see it because_1
sw2777A-ms98-a-0091 579.758000 585.781375 you know school would get canceled probably a week week and a half each year
sw2777A-ms98-a-0092 585.781375 587.556125 [silence]
sw2777A-ms98-a-0093 587.556125 588.959625 pardon
sw2777A-ms98-a-0094 588.959625 592.251250 [silence]
sw2777A-ms98-a-0095 592.251250 600.389500 yeah you had a lot of snow and and you always had to scoop it and it was it was fun to play in but you know last few years
