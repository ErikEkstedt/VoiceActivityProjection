sw2792A-ms98-a-0128 527.047250 533.822875 and i don't know and well you know with the other part of this thing was how do you feel that this influences family 
sw2792A-ms98-a-0129 533.822875 535.014750 [silence]
sw2792A-ms98-a-0130 535.014750 539.966125 that that books influence do you know how to use them in your life or to influence
sw2792A-ms98-a-0131 539.966125 540.991750 [silence]
sw2792A-ms98-a-0132 540.991750 546.661250 i i feel like it's important for young children to read too and what you read to them
sw2792A-ms98-a-0133 546.661250 555.055625 when my children were were younger course they were all married and grown and i have grandchildren now they were uh i i read to them a lot 
sw2792A-ms98-a-0134 555.055625 568.666625 and uh i think they've all developed kind of an interest in reading also i'm not saying they read all the right things but they do read uh where a lot of people don't have any interest in it at all and i think it's important
sw2792A-ms98-a-0135 568.666625 579.187375 because uh even today where people are so illiterate and they go off to school and really nothing happens i mean they don't learn anything it's because they can't read
sw2792A-ms98-a-0136 579.187375 581.449125 [silence]
sw2792A-ms98-a-0137 581.449125 582.658750 yeah
sw2792A-ms98-a-0138 582.658750 587.080250 [silence]
sw2792A-ms98-a-0139 587.080250 589.829125 oh it's so unbelievable isn't it
sw2792A-ms98-a-0140 589.829125 591.352125 yeah
sw2792A-ms98-a-0141 591.352125 592.827125 [silence]
sw2792A-ms98-a-0142 592.827125 596.930125 exactly and i think that that's why reading is so important
sw2792A-ms98-a-0143 596.930125 600.503250 because uh i think even mentally when you can do some
