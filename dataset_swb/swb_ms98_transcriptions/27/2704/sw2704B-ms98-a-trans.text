sw2704B-ms98-a-0003 5.405125 9.851750 oh i guess mostly uh really i get the
sw2704B-ms98-a-0004 9.851750 16.360625 i guess the headlines on the news and then i read the newspaper for a little more detail
sw2704B-ms98-a-0005 16.360625 22.261250 uh i used to take some news magazines but i found that i just didn't have enough time to really read them_1
sw2704B-ms98-a-0006 22.261250 23.250500 [silence]
sw2704B-ms98-a-0007 23.250500 27.045500 yeah yeah to get my money's worth out of it you know i'd
sw2704B-ms98-a-0008 27.045500 38.088875 i'd oh i was taking Newsweek for a long time and i'd read it a little bit and put it back for a while and you know first thing you know i'm reading a [laughter-a] three week old news magazine
sw2704B-ms98-a-0009 38.088875 42.470000 [laughter] that got to be kind of silly so i cut that out
sw2704B-ms98-a-0010 42.470000 46.285375 but i do read the paper just oh just about every day
sw2704B-ms98-a-0011 46.285375 51.107625 [silence]
sw2704B-ms98-a-0012 51.107625 52.498125 um-hum

sw2704B-ms98-a-0016 63.973250 75.979000 yeah yeah i'm i like to watch the news uh i[f]- if i really know that something's going on because_1 like i say you you can kind of get the headlines and a pretty quick thumbnail sketch of what's going on
sw2704B-ms98-a-0017 75.979000 79.384750 but then i i like the paper because you do get more detail
sw2704B-ms98-a-0018 79.384750 82.275625 [silence]
sw2704B-ms98-a-0019 82.275625 85.368125 oh i[t]- i tell you i[t]-
sw2704B-ms98-a-0020 85.368125 90.305250 yeah i think it does i i tell you it's it's really interesting when
sw2704B-ms98-a-0021 90.305250 97.658125 when you are personally involved or or personally see something that happened and then gets reported on later
sw2704B-ms98-a-0022 97.658125 102.843000 it's it's you know i've i've kind of been in that situation a couple of times and it's
sw2704B-ms98-a-0023 102.843000 111.928625 it's interesting to see how the how the reporters and h[ow]- and how the other people y[ou]- you know yeah how they saw it as opposed to how you saw it
sw2704B-ms98-a-0024 111.928625 117.970625 and and sometimes it's uh you know sometimes it's just like i saw it and then again sometimes it's [laughter-not]
sw2704B-ms98-a-0025 117.970625 120.230125 [silence]
sw2704B-ms98-a-0026 120.230125 121.620500 yeah

sw2704B-ms98-a-0028 123.918125 134.467625 yeah but uh it's i don't know it's you know the problem is you really don't know i think so many times if if the coverage is accurate or it fair
sw2704B-ms98-a-0029 134.467625 137.313625 and that's that's the problem i guess uh
sw2704B-ms98-a-0030 137.313625 143.070375 [silence]
sw2704B-ms98-a-0031 143.070375 144.285750 uh-huh

sw2704B-ms98-a-0036 152.652750 162.379000 yeah it's uh i[t's]- it's interesting to to hear from the experts you know the so-called experts but i think sometimes they tend to go a little overboard
sw2704B-ms98-a-0037 162.379000 169.732750 [silence]
sw2704B-ms98-a-0038 169.732750 170.776750 uh-huh

sw2704B-ms98-a-0041 177.468375 190.900875 yeah it's kind of funny we were we were kind of discussing that at work one day and i[t]- you know the the introduction to the experts that they have you know this is Mister Jones he's been working on this project for thirty years you know he knows all there is to know about it
sw2704B-ms98-a-0042 190.900875 200.308750 and we just kind of looked around at our project at TI and you know we've got people that have been on the project for a long time that you know don't know the first thing about what's going [laughter-on]
sw2704B-ms98-a-0043 200.308750 206.990375 so we're kind of quoting those guys [laughter-and] you know and everybody's having a good time with it 
sw2704B-ms98-a-0044 206.990375 213.349375 so that just uh you know that's a a a little lesson on how the experts can be
sw2704B-ms98-a-0045 213.349375 215.531125 but uh i
sw2704B-ms98-a-0046 215.531125 221.881500 [silence]
