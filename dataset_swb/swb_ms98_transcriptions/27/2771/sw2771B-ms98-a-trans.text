sw2771B-ms98-a-0003 10.815750 17.514875 well other than the Nicaraguan situation where we kicked out the dictator of that country and his case is yet to come to trial and all that
sw2771B-ms98-a-0004 17.514875 22.021500 i can't say that i've kept up too much with it i know that the Colombians for awhile
sw2771B-ms98-a-0005 22.021500 30.065875 we were trying to do something to give them the incentive to get out of the drug trade and there was a lot of assassinations and killings and that sort of thing going on down there
sw2771B-ms98-a-0006 30.065875 33.443750 because they were trying to clean up the mobster crowd
sw2771B-ms98-a-0007 33.443750 45.473875 uh but uh other than that uh the only thing i ever hear about a country like Brazil or some place like that is advertisements to come [laughter-enjoy] their their beaches and the like and what is it Rio de Janeiro

sw2771B-ms98-a-0044 203.716125 216.401375 well i don't think uh i- i agree with you i think you're right we have exploited but i- i think that the leadership that Mexico has had up until for some phenomenally lucky reason has been a rather than corrupt
sw2771B-ms98-a-0045 216.401375 223.358750 um feudalistic type of leadership everybody sort of on the take sort of like the way uh the uh
sw2771B-ms98-a-0046 223.358750 227.005625 uh w[hat]- what was that bunch that used to run the Philippines
sw2771B-ms98-a-0047 227.005625 228.017250 [silence]
sw2771B-ms98-a-0048 228.017250 239.308250 yeah yeah so that sort of thing and the guy they got in this last time uh he for once is a tried and true and really you know outright capitalist from the word go
sw2771B-ms98-a-0049 239.308250 244.831750 and he wants to take the government off the peoples backs and really get free enterprise on started
sw2771B-ms98-a-0050 244.831750 250.623250 and i was reading i think in Newsweek or Time or one of those or US News World Reports one of those {mags} that uh
sw2771B-ms98-a-0051 250.623250 251.699625 [silence]
sw2771B-ms98-a-0052 251.699625 253.290625 uh
sw2771B-ms98-a-0053 253.290625 263.049375 they were having a tough time with the peasant farmer situation being able to compete with uh American farming industry because we have these huge conglomerates
sw2771B-ms98-a-0054 263.049375 266.567750 well he went out using the governments [vocalized-noise] uh
sw2771B-ms98-a-0055 266.567750 274.413125 uh finances or or whatever you call it he went out and and gathered together a lot of the farmers who had small farms inside one another
sw2771B-ms98-a-0056 274.413125 278.214125 and he pulled together sort of like a a commune
sw2771B-ms98-a-0057 278.214125 285.480375 but yet he let's them_1 each be a free enterprise uh uh person but they work together in terms of what they organize to grow
sw2771B-ms98-a-0058 285.480375 299.437125 and they grow massive amounts of things that are common to each other in certain areas and yet they vary their crops in such a way that they they uh can be very productive in how ma[ny]- much of these crops they make but they can also roll them_1 over
sw2771B-ms98-a-0059 299.437125 303.326000 and then they market it altogether as a group as a force
sw2771B-ms98-a-0060 303.326000 308.185625 and as a result uh it said that uh since they started the program of course it went kind of
sw2771B-ms98-a-0061 308.185625 315.230375 kind of uh rough at first but apparently since they got the program going that they uh amount of money and the uh
sw2771B-ms98-a-0062 315.230375 321.844000 uh profit and standard of living that they're able to to reap from it has gone up almost tenfold from this
sw2771B-ms98-a-0063 321.844000 332.294250 and so uh this guy may be actually going to finely turn the uh the country on i mean it's always been tough for the southern or or lower latitude countries 
sw2771B-ms98-a-0064 332.294250 336.559000 to be as productive as some reason another and as the higher latitude countries
sw2771B-ms98-a-0065 336.559000 344.202750 i've often wondered if that does have something to do with the the climate being uh so warm that it tends to make work harder to do
sw2771B-ms98-a-0066 344.202750 345.302250 [silence]
sw2771B-ms98-a-0067 345.302250 346.400375 i don't know
sw2771B-ms98-a-0068 346.400375 353.730875 but it does seem like that there has always been a preponderance of countries in the middle latitude zones that uh
sw2771B-ms98-a-0069 353.730875 362.706375 uh seem to always lack in their ability to to develop industrially uh as well as even very well agriculturally
sw2771B-ms98-a-0070 362.706375 364.382000 i don't know

sw2771B-ms98-a-0080 388.523500 394.840625 yeah and and they have been uh they have had spurts at times i know i think it was uh Chile
sw2771B-ms98-a-0081 394.840625 396.271250 uh
sw2771B-ms98-a-0082 396.271250 399.379875 that has been [vocalized-noise] fairly capitalistic
sw2771B-ms98-a-0083 399.379875 409.002125 that have had spurts of times when they did rather well and then they sort of reverse because they have some sort of a military take over or something like that and they go into a dictatorship for awhile and
sw2771B-ms98-a-0084 409.002125 411.598750 and it would just sort of uh go downhill
sw2771B-ms98-a-0085 411.598750 413.902875 but uh uh
sw2771B-ms98-a-0086 413.902875 419.768750 i don't know that that they don't seem to be able to keep any particular stable regime for any particular long period of time
sw2771B-ms98-a-0087 419.768750 422.998000 in their capitalistic type governments

sw2771B-ms98-a-0093 444.095375 451.080250 yeah unless they have a coffee strike or the drug problem gets out of uh proportion like it did for awhile

sw2771B-ms98-a-0095 453.389125 460.616875 that's right or or unless they're kicking the British's [laughter-butts] like they did in the Falkland Islands something like that where it involves one of our allies
sw2771B-ms98-a-0096 460.616875 461.904500 then
sw2771B-ms98-a-0097 461.904500 463.866500 you're you're right and um
sw2771B-ms98-a-0098 463.866500 465.918750 i wonder why that is
sw2771B-ms98-a-0099 465.918750 475.650125 [silence]
sw2771B-ms98-a-0100 475.650125 488.600000 could it possibly be because of they're they're little third world countries and they are all independent from one another where as if they had of somehow or another from their past history formed into a larger country like our continental United States did
sw2771B-ms98-a-0101 488.600000 498.894250 and uh developed uh uh a free enterprise capitalistic type of economy with a common form of government that they could have uh uh been a force in the world though
sw2771B-ms98-a-0102 498.894250 502.703375 i don't know i- i- i ask what what went wrong what was different
sw2771B-ms98-a-0103 502.703375 511.972750 they certainly have the climates in the southern hemisphere uh uh to have been easily as productive and i certainly think they have rich enough land i don't think uh
sw2771B-ms98-a-0104 511.972750 523.348750 the continental of South America as i recall my geography that's been along time ago as being any particularly uh different or or lacking in terms of agricultural or industrial or river
sw2771B-ms98-a-0105 523.348750 528.563750 rivers that were naturally there or so forth that they could not have de[veloped]- developed a uh
sw2771B-ms98-a-0106 528.563750 535.197875 a pretty uh uh uh by today's standards modern type of economy
