sw2771A-ms98-a-0002 0.767625 1.892250 all right
sw2771A-ms98-a-0003 1.892250 8.863125 you know like you said i haven't uh been keeping track of what all has been going on in uh Central America myself
sw2771A-ms98-a-0004 8.863125 11.695125 um and uh
sw2771A-ms98-a-0005 11.695125 17.042625 [silence]
sw2771A-ms98-a-0006 17.042625 18.338875 um-hum
sw2771A-ms98-a-0007 18.338875 32.901750 [silence]
sw2771A-ms98-a-0008 32.901750 34.159625 yeah
sw2771A-ms98-a-0009 34.159625 44.766625 [silence]
sw2771A-ms98-a-0010 44.766625 47.842125 yeah yeah yeah i know what your talking about
sw2771A-ms98-a-0011 47.842125 49.625375 um [vocalized-noise]
sw2771A-ms98-a-0012 49.625375 62.601500 i've i've listened to a lot of things going on i mean uh the uh Manuel Noriega Panama thing i think was probably the right thing to do i mean the guy was just blatantly going out and shooting Americans
sw2771A-ms98-a-0013 62.601500 66.673875 and uh so i think what they did there was right
sw2771A-ms98-a-0014 66.673875 73.767500 i'm not so sure about uh what they're doing in some of the other countries where we're supporting guerillas that are fighting the communists
sw2771A-ms98-a-0015 73.767500 76.151500 you know regimes that are in there
sw2771A-ms98-a-0016 76.151500 79.037750 uh because it never seems to really work
sw2771A-ms98-a-0017 79.037750 88.626625 and we end up throwing in money and a lot of people getting killed and when push comes to shove we seem to back out on the gorillas like we did the Kurds back uh in the late seventies
sw2771A-ms98-a-0018 88.626625 93.080500 and so that that that kind of thing concerns me um
sw2771A-ms98-a-0019 93.080500 98.903000 it's the things that we're not doing that we should be doing like right now there's a big outbreak of uh
sw2771A-ms98-a-0020 98.903000 109.848750 of course it's a little further south in South America but there's an outbreak of uh uh what is it cholera in uh Peru and all so it's uh gotten into Columbia now
sw2771A-ms98-a-0021 109.848750 116.331750 and it looks like it's going to be a pretty serious uh thing there they're talking about it lasting for ten years
sw2771A-ms98-a-0022 116.331750 120.711625 [silence]
sw2771A-ms98-a-0023 120.711625 134.551125 yeah and it's it's already gotten in[to]- into Brazil a little bit and it has to do with the fact that uh i mean in that part of the world they just dump raw sewage right into the rivers i mean things that we don't do here anymore because we know how bad it is for you
sw2771A-ms98-a-0024 134.551125 138.554375 yet they're they're you know they're s[teadily]- steadily doing it down there
sw2771A-ms98-a-0025 138.554375 139.756000 and it
sw2771A-ms98-a-0026 139.756000 142.401125 [silence]
sw2771A-ms98-a-0027 142.401125 147.952750 they actually don't have filtration systems uh [vocalized-noise] the some of the major cities do
sw2771A-ms98-a-0028 147.952750 154.098250 um but for the most part most of those countries they just flat out pump it right into the rivers
sw2771A-ms98-a-0029 154.098250 157.997000 and let it float on down and pump it right out into the ocean
sw2771A-ms98-a-0030 157.997000 165.580000 and that's you know that's how they deal with it and you know they're just steadily polluting that part of the part of the world that way
sw2771A-ms98-a-0031 165.580000 169.743625 um the other thing is the uh economic assistance uh
sw2771A-ms98-a-0032 169.743625 174.923500 right now we're starting we're starting to talk about having free trade with Mexico
sw2771A-ms98-a-0033 174.923500 183.041875 and my God this is something we should have done years ago and Mexico is our closest neighbor they've been in financial trouble for years
sw2771A-ms98-a-0034 183.041875 193.014250 and i think we've exploited them i mean when i was in Texas i noticed that uh you know you think of Texas and you have you know good meat and fresh vegetables and all that
sw2771A-ms98-a-0035 193.014250 197.091125 well most of the vegetables they sold in Texas came from Mexico and so did the meat
sw2771A-ms98-a-0036 197.091125 202.858625 the meat that was raised in Texas they sent back east to sell because_1 they get more money for it
sw2771A-ms98-a-0037 202.858625 204.714125 and uh
sw2771A-ms98-a-0038 204.714125 226.968500 [silence]
sw2771A-ms98-a-0039 226.968500 228.774250 yeah The Marcos

sw2771A-ms98-a-0043 262.543500 263.778750 right
sw2771A-ms98-a-0044 263.778750 277.651375 [silence]
sw2771A-ms98-a-0045 277.651375 278.965000 um-hum

sw2771A-ms98-a-0049 321.028000 322.677000 that's great

sw2771A-ms98-a-0053 362.016500 366.007125 yeah yeah that that that probably has some bearing on it
sw2771A-ms98-a-0054 366.007125 373.183625 um also there's uh a uh tradition of just doing enough to get by
sw2771A-ms98-a-0055 373.183625 378.681750 they're they're not as uh motivated as uh as as we are and
sw2771A-ms98-a-0056 378.681750 380.326000 people farther south
sw2771A-ms98-a-0057 380.326000 388.500750 now you know once you you get down into Chile and Argentina and those kinds of areas i mean their their climates are pretty much the same as ours
sw2771A-ms98-a-0058 388.500750 402.026500 [silence]
sw2771A-ms98-a-0059 402.026500 403.273875 yeah

sw2771A-ms98-a-0061 422.367500 425.836000 yeah and while we're sitting here talking about it i'm thinking
sw2771A-ms98-a-0062 425.836000 430.632375 you know we know every darn thing that goes on everyday in Europe
sw2771A-ms98-a-0063 430.632375 439.607750 you know i mean we know what's going on in Poland we know what's going on in Romania we know the Germanies are getting back together we didn't you know we know all what's going in Europe
sw2771A-ms98-a-0064 439.607750 445.433750 but we never here anything about what's going on down in S[outh]- you know in South and Central America
sw2771A-ms98-a-0065 445.433750 450.229750 [silence]
sw2771A-ms98-a-0066 450.229750 454.710250 or unless we're sending thousands of troops down there to kick somebody's butt i mean
sw2771A-ms98-a-0067 454.710250 456.066000 [silence]
sw2771A-ms98-a-0068 456.066000 457.624500 [laughter-yeah]

sw2771A-ms98-a-0070 459.882625 462.304375 yeah we just don't pay any attention to them_1
sw2771A-ms98-a-0071 462.304375 465.026000 [silence]
sw2771A-ms98-a-0072 465.026000 467.854750 yeah it's it's you know it's
sw2771A-ms98-a-0073 467.854750 476.597375 it just doesn't make any sense i mean we're in the same uh hemisphere [spo/so] [vocalized-noise] so to speak i mean you know the same side of the earth i mean
sw2771A-ms98-a-0074 476.597375 498.115875 [silence]
sw2771A-ms98-a-0075 498.115875 499.485250 yeah

sw2771A-ms98-a-0079 535.030000 539.331625 yeah yeah i mean it doesn't it really doesn't make sense to me
sw2771A-ms98-a-0080 539.331625 541.130375 [noise] i don't [vocalized-noise] you know it's
sw2771A-ms98-a-0081 541.130375 550.913125 i mean they've never really been a real force in the world i mean uh we heard about Argentina only when it tried to take over the Falcons and England had to go down there and kick their butt
sw2771A-ms98-a-0082 550.913125 556.958375 um so it's it's like really strange that we never pay that much attention
sw2771A-ms98-a-0083 556.958375 558.439125 i- i
sw2771A-ms98-a-0084 558.439125 564.847500 you know i just find myself lacking in in a lot of knowledge about South America [vocalized-noise]
sw2771A-ms98-a-0085 564.847500 568.358750 i'd like to think i know a lot about a lot of things but
sw2771A-ms98-a-0086 568.358750 569.647625 you know i have
sw2771A-ms98-a-0087 569.647625 570.666125 [silence]
sw2771A-ms98-a-0088 570.666125 575.831125 something is amiss here as far as the amount of information that's available
sw2771A-ms98-a-0089 575.831125 577.649750 uh
sw2771A-ms98-a-0090 577.649750 585.202875 i don't know if it's intentional on the part of you know the the powers that be or whether no body really cares
