sw2795A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.413125 [noise]
sw2795A-ms98-a-0002 0.413125 1.468125 [silence]
sw2795A-ms98-a-0003 1.468125 4.719250 the basic question is too much
sw2795A-ms98-a-0004 4.719250 6.245125 and
sw2795A-ms98-a-0005 6.245125 17.784625 i don't know my my opinion i guess here in North Carolina they announced that May second was the uh tax day that's when you everything you've earned so far has gone to taxes
sw2795A-ms98-a-0006 17.784625 20.255500 the rest of the year is yours
sw2795A-ms98-a-0007 20.255500 24.951125 that represents about a third of your income
sw2795A-ms98-a-0008 24.951125 30.090500 and i don't know uh who came up with that figure but i think it really comes out to be more than the third
sw2795A-ms98-a-0009 30.090500 36.826250 but uh i i don't know i find myself in a position sort of like selective
sw2795A-ms98-a-0010 36.826250 44.616500 approval almost like the United Way campaign where you agree with most of the agencies but uh don't agree with some of them
sw2795A-ms98-a-0011 44.616500 46.249125 and
sw2795A-ms98-a-0012 46.249125 49.795375 i think that we could have less tax
sw2795A-ms98-a-0013 49.795375 52.034750 by cutting out some of the
sw2795A-ms98-a-0014 52.034750 53.493125 the uh
sw2795A-ms98-a-0015 53.493125 56.005125 programs that we support
sw2795A-ms98-a-0016 56.005125 63.762125 but overall i guess we're pretty fortunate nature nation as far as the amount of tax that we have to pay how do you feel
sw2795A-ms98-a-0017 63.762125 71.960750 [silence]
sw2795A-ms98-a-0018 71.960750 80.988250 yeah i've done some business overseas in in Latin America and of course know about the we hear about Sweden with their
sw2795A-ms98-a-0019 80.988250 91.326625 uh social program but you don't hear what the cost is same in Eur[ope]- in Britain and other nations much higher tax rates
sw2795A-ms98-a-0020 91.326625 93.993375 but the
sw2795A-ms98-a-0021 93.993375 109.755500 [silence]
sw2795A-ms98-a-0022 109.755500 111.359625 oh yes
sw2795A-ms98-a-0023 111.359625 119.956750 [silence]
sw2795A-ms98-a-0024 119.956750 131.628250 oh yes that that's the uh the type of thing that really irritates me where they can get significant increases when everyone else is facing layoffs or or cutbacks or
sw2795A-ms98-a-0025 131.628250 135.922875 uh equating it to a personal income situation
sw2795A-ms98-a-0026 135.922875 140.842375 and yet it's almost automatic or it's hidden and
sw2795A-ms98-a-0027 140.842375 145.959750 uh i think they need to bite the same bullet that most individuals do
sw2795A-ms98-a-0028 145.959750 147.438875 [silence]
sw2795A-ms98-a-0029 147.438875 151.911000 the one of the other problems that i have recently is
sw2795A-ms98-a-0030 151.911000 158.092750 centered on such things as the trip by Dan Quayle to Augusta Georgia to play golf
sw2795A-ms98-a-0031 158.092750 163.384000 and i realize that constant communication is necessary
sw2795A-ms98-a-0032 163.384000 168.070500 especially when Bush had his uh 
sw2795A-ms98-a-0033 168.070500 172.027250 heart rhythm problem this weekend but
sw2795A-ms98-a-0034 172.027250 178.153000 we can always send jets for someone i think if if they're out of pocket
sw2795A-ms98-a-0035 178.153000 182.955750 rather than accepting it as the norm for a nice golfing trip
sw2795A-ms98-a-0036 182.955750 184.234000 [silence]
sw2795A-ms98-a-0037 184.234000 190.420500 so that's what i meant about the selectives some things i think we're doing extremely wrong could save a lot of money
sw2795A-ms98-a-0038 190.420500 193.043625 but other things uh
sw2795A-ms98-a-0039 193.043625 201.105125 like i enjoy seeing money spent on the Smithsonian Institute in Washington i think it's one of the nicest national treasures and i love to see
sw2795A-ms98-a-0040 201.105125 209.347500 kids of uh any background roaming through and seeing such great collections
sw2795A-ms98-a-0041 209.347500 210.495625 [silence]
sw2795A-ms98-a-0042 210.495625 211.724375 but
sw2795A-ms98-a-0043 211.724375 216.342000 then when when we talk about all the foreign aid that we give away
sw2795A-ms98-a-0044 216.342000 218.749875 that bothers me a lot
sw2795A-ms98-a-0045 218.749875 220.034250 [silence]
sw2795A-ms98-a-0046 220.034250 227.571000 i don't know how to solve the problem though when as you said the uh bureaucracy gets out of hand regardless of who you vote for
sw2795A-ms98-a-0047 227.571000 230.206000 the bureaucracy continues too
sw2795A-ms98-a-0048 230.206000 242.220250 [silence]
sw2795A-ms98-a-0049 242.220250 243.606125 uh-huh
sw2795A-ms98-a-0050 243.606125 248.380875 [silence]
sw2795A-ms98-a-0051 248.380875 250.435375 oh i think it's way
sw2795A-ms98-a-0052 250.435375 255.563375 it's way out of hand i'm almost turning into an isolationist [laughter]
sw2795A-ms98-a-0053 255.563375 266.136625 which is not not a good attitude in in global uh communications and everything that we have this these days but it's a matter of uh
sw2795A-ms98-a-0054 266.136625 271.918625 i hate to see money thrown away and that's what i re[ally]- i equate to some of our foreign aid policies
sw2795A-ms98-a-0055 271.918625 279.426250 [silence]
sw2795A-ms98-a-0056 279.426250 280.703375 and they
sw2795A-ms98-a-0057 280.703375 281.936250 [silence]
sw2795A-ms98-a-0058 281.936250 284.349500 i agree i think that's
sw2795A-ms98-a-0059 284.349500 291.300750 i have some problem with social programs at home in terms of making it too convenient to be on on welfare
sw2795A-ms98-a-0060 291.300750 296.668750 [silence]
sw2795A-ms98-a-0061 296.668750 307.554250 oh yeah yeah i i think when you get to a point where it's more economical to stay on welfare than it is to get a job you've got a basic concept problem
sw2795A-ms98-a-0062 307.554250 308.815875 yeah
sw2795A-ms98-a-0063 308.815875 309.990500 [silence]
sw2795A-ms98-a-0064 309.990500 315.775875 but i i think uh if we're going to waste money i'd almost see rather see us waste it at home [laughter]
sw2795A-ms98-a-0065 315.775875 320.149625 than overseas too and that there's some unusual
sw2795A-ms98-a-0066 320.149625 324.133125 things which can occur in the foreign aid uh
sw2795A-ms98-a-0067 324.133125 331.484750 by a stroke of a pen i think our president can forgive foreign debt and that's a lot of power vested in one
sw2795A-ms98-a-0068 331.484750 335.330125 one person in our system of uh
sw2795A-ms98-a-0069 335.330125 337.079000 governance
sw2795A-ms98-a-0070 337.079000 339.332375 and i've seen that happen
sw2795A-ms98-a-0071 339.332375 344.100750 over the last few years and you and i are paying for it
sw2795A-ms98-a-0072 344.100750 345.979625 [silence]
sw2795A-ms98-a-0073 345.979625 351.890500 but Jim it comes back a lot to the same thing that you said initially you've been overseas and have seen
sw2795A-ms98-a-0074 351.890500 354.044500 other places
sw2795A-ms98-a-0075 354.044500 358.440875 and i guess we're still fortunate but i think we're ju[st]- i just want us to be smarter
sw2795A-ms98-a-0076 358.440875 360.036500 than we are
sw2795A-ms98-a-0077 360.036500 368.118750 [silence]
sw2795A-ms98-a-0078 368.118750 369.462875 uh-huh
sw2795A-ms98-a-0079 369.462875 386.114375 [silence]
sw2795A-ms98-a-0080 386.114375 394.054750 yeah well your your neighbor to the north Oklahoma just voted for state legislators uh one term
sw2795A-ms98-a-0081 394.054750 395.648875 no let's see
sw2795A-ms98-a-0082 395.648875 398.428500 i forget was it one term or two term
sw2795A-ms98-a-0083 398.428500 400.647125 fixed
sw2795A-ms98-a-0084 400.647125 406.584000 uh incumbency in other words they can't be reel[ected]- reelected after
sw2795A-ms98-a-0085 406.584000 409.052625 i think maybe the second term
sw2795A-ms98-a-0086 409.052625 413.390125 [silence]
sw2795A-ms98-a-0087 413.390125 414.794875 federal
sw2795A-ms98-a-0088 414.794875 415.879000 [silence]
sw2795A-ms98-a-0089 415.879000 417.187125 yeah
sw2795A-ms98-a-0090 417.187125 419.170875 [silence]
sw2795A-ms98-a-0091 419.170875 426.101125 yeah i think it takes away the issue of of a lot of the uh special lobbyist groups and everything else
sw2795A-ms98-a-0092 426.101125 428.816875 creating the incumbent uh
sw2795A-ms98-a-0093 428.816875 429.821625 [silence]
sw2795A-ms98-a-0094 429.821625 431.013125 about
sw2795A-ms98-a-0095 431.013125 434.580375 invincib[ility]- invincibility
sw2795A-ms98-a-0096 434.580375 436.062250 but
sw2795A-ms98-a-0097 436.062250 441.487000 there's another problem with that i'd we've got some good ones and i hate to see them leave [laughter]
sw2795A-ms98-a-0098 441.487000 445.017875 but it i guess it's hard to to really uh
sw2795A-ms98-a-0099 445.017875 448.180750 identify which are the good and which are the bad
sw2795A-ms98-a-0100 448.180750 451.778250 the electorate seems to be putting them all back in
sw2795A-ms98-a-0101 451.778250 452.800625 [silence]
sw2795A-ms98-a-0102 452.800625 457.245125 and i thought this last election would be different but it it turned out it really wasn't
sw2795A-ms98-a-0103 457.245125 479.755375 [silence]
sw2795A-ms98-a-0104 479.755375 481.170875 uh-huh
sw2795A-ms98-a-0105 481.170875 484.258875 [silence]
sw2795A-ms98-a-0106 484.258875 489.514875 uh it doesn't solve the non elected bureauc[rats]- bureaucrats either that's
sw2795A-ms98-a-0107 489.514875 494.143625 that's an issue i think that really fits into it because there are a lot of people that sit
sw2795A-ms98-a-0108 494.143625 498.714500 in the same position and really don't give a hoot who gets elected
sw2795A-ms98-a-0109 498.714500 503.605625 they still kind of run the show and and setup all the roadblocks and the
sw2795A-ms98-a-0110 503.605625 505.555125 the uh
sw2795A-ms98-a-0111 505.555125 509.498625 horrendous regulations and everything else
sw2795A-ms98-a-0112 509.498625 512.200125 but it's uh
sw2795A-ms98-a-0113 512.200125 517.093125 it's our system i think now we have to figure out how to really manage it well
sw2795A-ms98-a-0114 517.093125 524.332375 [silence]
sw2795A-ms98-a-0115 524.332375 527.956750 uh-huh uh-huh i think that's right
sw2795A-ms98-a-0116 527.956750 529.606500 well
sw2795A-ms98-a-0117 529.606500 533.849375 [silence]
sw2795A-ms98-a-0118 533.849375 539.035500 yeah How do you feel about the information we get uh
sw2795A-ms98-a-0119 539.035500 544.488500 from Congress that that affects us as far as the uh
sw2795A-ms98-a-0120 544.488500 547.511875 knowledge to to elect the right people
sw2795A-ms98-a-0121 547.511875 548.734875 [silence]
sw2795A-ms98-a-0122 548.734875 552.081875 i have i have a real problem federal register for instance

sw2795A-ms98-a-0124 553.324500 557.369875 uh you can have almost put anything in there you want to
sw2795A-ms98-a-0125 557.369875 562.045875 no it's not in the federal register what's the uh the congressional record
sw2795A-ms98-a-0126 562.045875 570.707750 uh someone can put in information retroactively to that to show that they supported something or uh
sw2795A-ms98-a-0127 570.707750 592.005625 [silence]
sw2795A-ms98-a-0128 592.005625 593.637750 yeah it
