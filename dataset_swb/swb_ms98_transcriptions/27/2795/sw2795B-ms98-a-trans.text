sw2795B-ms98-a-0004 71.200500 92.453875 [silence]
sw2795B-ms98-a-0005 92.453875 94.376750 it just seems as if
sw2795B-ms98-a-0006 94.376750 95.866125 [silence]
sw2795B-ms98-a-0007 95.866125 104.670125 from the time i've been following politics which was i guess about seventy five really got interested in politics and keeping up with it
sw2795B-ms98-a-0008 104.670125 110.915375 it just seems since that time the bureaucratic machine has just gotten so out of control
sw2795B-ms98-a-0009 110.915375 113.800125 and then they scream about that
sw2795B-ms98-a-0010 113.800125 120.516250 that or the uh politicians scream about they're going to try and not raise taxes but they vote in a raise for themselves every year
sw2795B-ms98-a-0011 120.516250 220.208125 [silence]
sw2795B-ms98-a-0012 220.208125 221.568875 [noise]
sw2795B-ms98-a-0013 221.568875 231.505500 [silence]
sw2795B-ms98-a-0014 231.505500 239.827000 i i have trouble understanding the entire concept of foreign i understand going into countries where they've had natural disasters
sw2795B-ms98-a-0015 239.827000 243.354250 and going in and giving relief aid that way
sw2795B-ms98-a-0016 243.354250 248.773625 but paying for their these countries to run their own governments
sw2795B-ms98-a-0017 248.773625 251.571625 i i've got a big hang-up with that
sw2795B-ms98-a-0018 251.571625 272.812000 [silence]
sw2795B-ms98-a-0019 272.812000 278.076500 it just seems like they keep saying we're helping this country or we're helping that country out
sw2795B-ms98-a-0020 278.076500 279.631250 [silence]
sw2795B-ms98-a-0021 279.631250 283.004375 wouldn't our money be better spent helping here at at home
sw2795B-ms98-a-0022 283.004375 291.222125 [silence]
sw2795B-ms98-a-0023 291.222125 297.880750 that's something i would and that subject in itself i'd love to see that entire thing revised
sw2795B-ms98-a-0024 297.880750 306.612500 [silence]
sw2795B-ms98-a-0025 306.612500 308.463375 something's got to change
sw2795B-ms98-a-0026 308.463375 310.462250 you know and turn drastically
sw2795B-ms98-a-0027 310.462250 361.312875 [silence]
sw2795B-ms98-a-0028 361.312875 362.840375 well we've got
sw2795B-ms98-a-0029 362.840375 364.648875 [silence]
sw2795B-ms98-a-0030 364.648875 369.611000 it's not like this country doesn't have the people with the knowledge we've got it
sw2795B-ms98-a-0031 369.611000 373.354750 we've got people that are willing to make change
sw2795B-ms98-a-0032 373.354750 381.751000 but as long as you've got career politicians that spend twenty five to forty five years in Washington
sw2795B-ms98-a-0033 381.751000 387.016875 playing power broker they're not going to do anything to t[ap]- tap out the well
sw2795B-ms98-a-0034 387.016875 409.278875 [silence]
sw2795B-ms98-a-0035 409.278875 416.257125 now that's something i would love to see happen not only in all the states but in the federal legislatures too
sw2795B-ms98-a-0036 416.257125 419.001500 two terms then they got to sit out one
sw2795B-ms98-a-0037 419.001500 453.165375 [silence]
sw2795B-ms98-a-0038 453.165375 454.558250 and i think
sw2795B-ms98-a-0039 454.558250 457.801125 [silence]
sw2795B-ms98-a-0040 457.801125 469.651875 the thing about the ones that are really up there doing what they were elected to do it doesn't matter if they're in that office or not if they have to sit out a term fine they're going to be able to do things behind the scenes
sw2795B-ms98-a-0041 469.651875 471.070250 [silence]
sw2795B-ms98-a-0042 471.070250 475.079000 either in the capacity of the lobbyist or in
sw2795B-ms98-a-0043 475.079000 476.829875 [silence]
sw2795B-ms98-a-0044 476.829875 482.837750 working within their party of of the state or national level to get things enacted
sw2795B-ms98-a-0045 482.837750 485.397375 that's not going to slow them down at all
sw2795B-ms98-a-0046 485.397375 518.782250 [silence]
sw2795B-ms98-a-0047 518.782250 525.778500 i think compared to the other systems that are out there without a doubt we've got probably the best system it just needs some fine tuning
sw2795B-ms98-a-0048 525.778500 529.120875 [silence]
sw2795B-ms98-a-0049 529.120875 535.076625 well the question is wh[o]- who's ready to put their hand on the first wrench and tighten the first bolt
sw2795B-ms98-a-0050 535.076625 573.465875 [silence]
sw2795B-ms98-a-0051 573.465875 575.135000 trying to get
sw2795B-ms98-a-0052 575.135000 576.166750 [silence]
sw2795B-ms98-a-0053 576.166750 577.590875 the um
sw2795B-ms98-a-0054 577.590875 578.633750 [silence]
sw2795B-ms98-a-0055 578.633750 582.059125 politicians to actually truthfully
sw2795B-ms98-a-0056 582.059125 589.595125 report what they did vote for what they didn't vote for when they were actually on the floor at their desk
sw2795B-ms98-a-0057 589.595125 590.599375 [silence]
sw2795B-ms98-a-0058 590.599375 593.412500 is almost is going to be impossible to do
sw2795B-ms98-a-0059 593.412500 595.591375 there is no accountability of them
sw2795B-ms98-a-0060 595.591375 598.894000 at any given time if you've been to Washington
