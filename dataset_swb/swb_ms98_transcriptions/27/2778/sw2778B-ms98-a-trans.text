sw2778B-ms98-a-0002 0.983500 8.960250 i- i think that uh recycling is uh is real important right now or or you know for our future of the ecology and everything

sw2778B-ms98-a-0004 14.704375 20.894750 where uh they pick up newspapers in their is they're part of the regular garbage pickup
sw2778B-ms98-a-0005 20.894750 23.485625 on uh Wednesdays every week
sw2778B-ms98-a-0006 23.485625 30.172000 and then we have recycling centers around you know for aluminum and glass and that kind of stuff

sw2778B-ms98-a-0011 46.317750 50.163000 and and yes i do stack the newspapers and put them out in the alley
sw2778B-ms98-a-0012 50.163000 51.997125 i did notice uh
sw2778B-ms98-a-0013 51.997125 59.653375 this Wednesday when i put them_1 out i must have gotten them_1 out late because they didn't pick them up so they probably picked them_1 up with the regular garbage yesterday

sw2778B-ms98-a-0025 199.709000 204.732625 i guess uh i- my main concern with uh with the recycling is that we should be
sw2778B-ms98-a-0026 204.732625 210.390250 more geared to recycling or to eliminating the use of so much stuff that
sw2778B-ms98-a-0027 210.390250 218.004375 does not uh return to it's original uh is not biodegradable uh the plastics and the
sw2778B-ms98-a-0028 218.004375 227.656000 styrofoams and things like that uh i really think we need to to really concentrate a lot more on on limiting tho[se]- the use of those
sw2778B-ms98-a-0029 227.656000 237.066625 uh i'm finding i'm i'm almost offended when i go into a restaurant now and they try to give me a styrofoam cup for coffee or something you know
sw2778B-ms98-a-0030 237.066625 240.810875 but uh i think there's there's got to be a better way
sw2778B-ms98-a-0031 240.810875 256.335000 [silence]
sw2778B-ms98-a-0032 256.335000 256.956125 yeah

sw2778B-ms98-a-0039 290.333500 298.870500 i guess that's a a good idea i do i would like to see uh we talk about buying the larger containers i'd like to see those larger containers not the
sw2778B-ms98-a-0040 298.870500 302.799625 uh not the plastic bottles i guess is the main thing
sw2778B-ms98-a-0041 302.799625 310.020500 [silence]
sw2778B-ms98-a-0042 310.020500 311.557375 right yeah

sw2778B-ms98-a-0044 315.771500 318.386875 yeah it's got to but it's got to go back to
sw2778B-ms98-a-0045 318.386875 322.356250 to the same product or is that is that the way it works

sw2778B-ms98-a-0052 351.205125 357.800125 yeah i saw a uh an advertisement on television yesterday for a garden hose it's a a soaker hose
sw2778B-ms98-a-0053 357.800125 360.509500 it's made out of recycled tires
sw2778B-ms98-a-0054 360.509500 364.718000 and uh i thought that was a was an interesting idea i had not
sw2778B-ms98-a-0055 364.718000 370.132125 i had not heard of that before but i you know i knew that tires were recycled quite you know quite a bit for different things

sw2778B-ms98-a-0067 407.067500 413.063250 that uh that's one of the things that we're looking at is you know where we where are we going to put the recycling bins [laughter]
