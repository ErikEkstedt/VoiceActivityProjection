sw2778A-ms98-a-0011 29.684750 32.821250 um-hum so do you recycle up those products

sw2778A-ms98-a-0021 59.398625 61.220000 yeah probably
sw2778A-ms98-a-0022 61.220000 73.032375 well they're uh out i'm out in uh California recycling has been in for a while i mean it's yes it's very important now i think it's actually always been important we're just recognizing it now that things are starting to run out um
sw2778A-ms98-a-0023 73.032375 76.064500 it's um
sw2778A-ms98-a-0024 76.064500 81.159250 the main key to making recycling is to make it more convenient for people i think
sw2778A-ms98-a-0025 81.159250 83.019875 and
sw2778A-ms98-a-0026 83.019875 91.298625 the community i was just in not the one i just moved to uh had basically whenever you took your trash out you could just throw another bin of
sw2778A-ms98-a-0027 91.298625 101.238875 recyclable refuse out and not to be very you know you could have cans and aluminum cans and tin cans and bottles and everything and apparently they sorted it out
sw2778A-ms98-a-0028 101.238875 103.597375 which increased their labor costs tremendously
sw2778A-ms98-a-0029 103.597375 112.768500 but uh that sure made it easy i mean there was like no excuse not to recycle you just need two trash cans and if it's recyclable you throw it in one and if it's not you throw it in the other and take both out
sw2778A-ms98-a-0030 112.768500 122.194750 um so that seemed to have been working quite well um seems like the other thing to make recycling more viable is to make it more economically uh
sw2778A-ms98-a-0031 122.194750 123.205250 [silence]
sw2778A-ms98-a-0032 123.205250 128.901625 [noise] you know increase the economic incentive uh like news re[cycled]- recycled newsprint isn't worth very much right now
sw2778A-ms98-a-0033 128.901625 132.108375 because there's a lot of it available and trees are still cheap
sw2778A-ms98-a-0034 132.108375 142.455375 so [noise] from a purely economic standpoint i'd say re[cycling]- one way to in[crease]- to increase the viability of recycling is to increase the cost of the raw materials
sw2778A-ms98-a-0035 142.455375 151.355125 uh through selective taxation or whatever currently most things like aluminum only cost what it costs the company to produce them
sw2778A-ms98-a-0036 151.355125 157.776875 um without any charge for you know long-term effects on the land or
sw2778A-ms98-a-0037 157.776875 164.237750 you know [vocalized-noise] with with min[imal]- minimal taxation for reple[nishing]- re[plenishing]- replenishing the land after the mine is gone or
sw2778A-ms98-a-0038 164.237750 172.029500 health costs or all sorts of things like that or for that matter anytime you take aluminum out of the ground you can view it as you're stealing if from future generations
sw2778A-ms98-a-0039 172.029500 173.052750 [silence]
sw2778A-ms98-a-0040 173.052750 179.213875 and [laughter] and no one ever pays them you know basically you run out of these things and uh
sw2778A-ms98-a-0041 179.213875 188.165875 and then you have to start using something else yeah it seems like we're using up a lot of the abundant mate[rials]- minerals right now i mean petroleum will be gone in about three decades
sw2778A-ms98-a-0042 188.165875 194.025000 at the rate we're going and it it just seems like increasing the raw cost of those would uh
sw2778A-ms98-a-0043 194.025000 200.537125 through you know more sensitivity of what the long term costs would be rather than just the extraction costs would
sw2778A-ms98-a-0044 200.537125 215.356250 [silence]
sw2778A-ms98-a-0045 215.356250 216.823375 yeah

sw2778A-ms98-a-0053 240.774875 247.019000 well things are changing i mean i've been really encouraged i've i mean i come from a family that's been recycling for thirty years
sw2778A-ms98-a-0054 247.019000 256.601750 and uh has always been you know concerned about these things and i'm just now starting to see you know significant social movement towards recycling
sw2778A-ms98-a-0055 256.601750 269.170000 um the community the Berkeley City Council coined a term called {precycling} which i liked which is the idea of well you can recycle all these little aluminum cans and all this and that but you can also
sw2778A-ms98-a-0056 269.170000 274.802500 purchase products in the first place which uh use less resources
sw2778A-ms98-a-0057 274.802500 283.793500 you know not buy those styrofoam cups not buy individual aluminum cans if you're going to buy soda but get some you know larger reusable cheaper container and things like that
sw2778A-ms98-a-0058 283.793500 290.139625 uh they call it precycling in other words keep {recycling} but minimize the original consumption too
sw2778A-ms98-a-0059 290.139625 302.432875 [silence]
sw2778A-ms98-a-0060 302.432875 306.152125 well it's funny because_1 plastic is incredibly recyclable
sw2778A-ms98-a-0061 306.152125 310.804750 um the problem is there's so many different types of plastic and they can't be mixed together
sw2778A-ms98-a-0062 310.804750 317.941875 but any one type of plastic can be recycled just about easier than anything because_1 it melts down real easily and so forth can be [noise]
sw2778A-ms98-a-0063 317.941875 321.999875 [silence]
sw2778A-ms98-a-0064 321.999875 331.825750 um there are a number of laws about that some things can't be recycled back into the same products for health concerns even though they're not scientifically valid health concerns
sw2778A-ms98-a-0065 331.825750 336.945875 i mean because_1 some you know anything will get killed when you melt down plastic [noise] uh
sw2778A-ms98-a-0066 336.945875 343.861625 but and other things made to be uh can go back you know glass can go back into glass bottles and stuff
sw2778A-ms98-a-0067 343.861625 352.586750 but if it's mixed plastic it can only go to certain uses it can make actually plastic lumber for like uh park benches and things like that out of mixed plastic
sw2778A-ms98-a-0068 352.586750 357.447875 [silence]
sw2778A-ms98-a-0069 357.447875 358.742750 uh-huh
sw2778A-ms98-a-0070 358.742750 360.132000 [silence]
sw2778A-ms98-a-0071 360.132000 361.668375 um-hum um-hum

sw2778A-ms98-a-0073 365.782375 366.843875 um-hum
sw2778A-ms98-a-0074 366.843875 369.827750 [silence]
sw2778A-ms98-a-0075 369.827750 378.184250 yeah although there's far a lot more could be done there are just there are yards just heaped with mountains literally mountains of tires which [laughter-they] [laughter-don't] [laughter-know] [laughter-what] [laughter-to] [laughter-do] [laughter-with]
sw2778A-ms98-a-0076 378.184250 380.856125 so if we can do more things with those that would be helpful
sw2778A-ms98-a-0077 380.856125 393.988000 [silence]
sw2778A-ms98-a-0078 393.988000 398.031375 yeah yeah and more efficient pickups and everything
sw2778A-ms98-a-0079 398.031375 402.539750 [silence]
sw2778A-ms98-a-0080 402.539750 404.315000 um-hum um-hum

sw2778A-ms98-a-0084 412.541500 415.802000 sure some kind of recycling chutes [laughter] or something
sw2778A-ms98-a-0085 415.802000 421.334625 [silence]
sw2778A-ms98-a-0086 421.334625 424.237125 well that would be admirable i- i think that's wonderful
sw2778A-ms98-a-0087 424.237125 432.598000 well great uh oh the last thing as long as i've got an audience [laughter] is the uh i really want to see more recycling of batteries
sw2778A-ms98-a-0088 432.598000 439.716125 because_1 batteries have all kinds of toxins in them_1 and they're quite recyclable and most people just throw them in the trash or they leak into the ground water or all kinds of stuff
sw2778A-ms98-a-0089 439.716125 443.600875 but most people aren't even aware that batteries are something you shouldn't throw away in the trash
sw2778A-ms98-a-0090 443.600875 447.546000 i mean like Japan it's illegal to throw batteries away in the trash
sw2778A-ms98-a-0091 447.546000 449.465250 [silence]
sw2778A-ms98-a-0092 449.465250 453.053000 well those are the worst defenders it's because_1 they're biggest but even some of the small ones
sw2778A-ms98-a-0093 453.053000 460.016125 need to be disposed of properly just your basic ten cell batteries um once they rust out there's some pretty nasty things in them especially_1 the mercury ones
sw2778A-ms98-a-0094 460.016125 461.101500 [silence]
sw2778A-ms98-a-0095 461.101500 465.879375 but um it's it's it's a regular trash item in this country
sw2778A-ms98-a-0096 465.879375 474.014375 um despite the fact that if you were if you were a company throwing that kind of stuff away the EPA could give you a major fine [laughter] because it's a toxin
sw2778A-ms98-a-0097 474.014375 480.803625 [silence]
sw2778A-ms98-a-0098 480.803625 484.086625 [laughter-okay] well nice talking with you bye-bye
