sw2779A-ms98-a-0010 15.120375 25.936000 well i think there's a lot to be said for that point of view i i really think that congress turned on the taps and then there were lots of people there to carry away the water
sw2779A-ms98-a-0011 25.936000 32.551375 [silence]
sw2779A-ms98-a-0012 32.551375 33.718000 um

sw2779A-ms98-a-0017 44.138625 49.163875 [silence]
sw2779A-ms98-a-0018 49.163875 50.521750 he'll pay for it
sw2779A-ms98-a-0019 50.521750 52.049250 absolutely
sw2779A-ms98-a-0020 52.049250 53.148375 that
sw2779A-ms98-a-0021 53.148375 55.347750 [silence]
sw2779A-ms98-a-0022 55.347750 66.013000 uh-huh i think that would've been a much smarter way to handle it and the another thing that would've helped a lot would be to make certain that [noise] the people who were going to use the money
sw2779A-ms98-a-0023 66.013000 67.810125 that we were providing
sw2779A-ms98-a-0024 67.810125 73.539250 should've had there own at stake they should've have a lot more of their own capital on the line
sw2779A-ms98-a-0025 73.539250 82.487625 when they can leverage just a very small investment into millions of dollars worth of tax payers money and it's turning out to be a lot more than that
sw2779A-ms98-a-0026 82.487625 91.969250 and [vocalized-noise] they have absolutely no incentive to uh treat it prudently they just uh hand it over to anybody who walks in and asks for it 
sw2779A-ms98-a-0027 91.969250 95.256000 [silence]
sw2779A-ms98-a-0028 95.256000 96.351625 um-hum
sw2779A-ms98-a-0029 96.351625 102.546625 they have nothing to lose and everything to gain you see you know can keep lending and keep growing
sw2779A-ms98-a-0030 102.546625 110.093750 then they can take the big salaries and have the all the perks and uh entertainment and so forth and then
sw2779A-ms98-a-0031 110.093750 114.740500 oh if people don't pay them back it's no skin off their nose they just
sw2779A-ms98-a-0032 114.740500 123.628375 [silence]

sw2779A-ms98-a-0036 130.211750 140.677625 well uh i don't know what could've been done other than the uh insurance regulation but i certainly think that was a mistake and the um
sw2779A-ms98-a-0037 140.677625 151.000250 i also think it was a mistake to reimburse all depositors over a hundred thousand dollars when they were told up-front that that was was was the limit
sw2779A-ms98-a-0038 151.000250 152.069375 [silence]
sw2779A-ms98-a-0039 152.069375 154.788500 because uh the promise is [vocalized-noise]
sw2779A-ms98-a-0040 154.788500 155.860500 [silence]
sw2779A-ms98-a-0041 155.860500 158.449625 yeah the promises don't mean anything now
sw2779A-ms98-a-0042 158.449625 163.538875 when the uh people put millions of dollars in some shaky operation
sw2779A-ms98-a-0043 163.538875 167.092500 uh they figure the tax payers will bail them out because they have

sw2779A-ms98-a-0049 176.796625 179.953875 uh i would've been in a little danger of
sw2779A-ms98-a-0050 179.953875 186.224250 uh you know i would've had to be very careful about where i put my money but i certainly would have
sw2779A-ms98-a-0051 186.224250 191.575625 been alert and i would not have just been chasing the highest percentage return
sw2779A-ms98-a-0052 191.575625 193.294500 on a CD
sw2779A-ms98-a-0053 193.294500 194.270375 [silence]
sw2779A-ms98-a-0054 194.270375 205.683500 yeah uh i don't think that'd be any great loss [laughter] we could do without a few of [laughter-those] they don't seem to be providing very much useful uh service to people

sw2779A-ms98-a-0059 235.776875 246.232250 yes you would and uh uh i don't see why the for large sums of money why it should be any different from investing in a CD i- i mean in a
sw2779A-ms98-a-0060 246.232250 250.940500 uh mutual fund or a money market fund or something like that
sw2779A-ms98-a-0061 250.940500 253.017375 uh there are no guarantees on them
sw2779A-ms98-a-0062 253.017375 254.064125 [silence]
sw2779A-ms98-a-0063 254.064125 258.113625 you uh you trust that the broker won't sell because certain
sw2779A-ms98-a-0064 258.113625 270.385125 brokerage houses will guarantee at least up to a certain point the investments in the funds that they manage but uh then you're uh just at the mercy of them because they could go under

sw2779A-ms98-a-0070 286.247375 295.372125 um-hum [noise] well uh do you think that we're heading for another uh debacle of this sort in the uh insurance industry
sw2779A-ms98-a-0071 295.372125 301.310125 [silence]
sw2779A-ms98-a-0072 301.310125 302.905875 and we see
sw2779A-ms98-a-0073 302.905875 310.247375 [silence]
sw2779A-ms98-a-0074 310.247375 311.544125 um-hum
sw2779A-ms98-a-0075 311.544125 314.012250 [silence]
sw2779A-ms98-a-0076 314.012250 322.692375 well i don't know how we're going to bail them out because if we're already how many trillion dollars in the hole where's the money going to come from
sw2779A-ms98-a-0077 322.692375 323.665125 [silence]
sw2779A-ms98-a-0078 323.665125 332.977125 and yet the we've got this enormous uh first executive insurance company just sailing out here in California and um
sw2779A-ms98-a-0079 332.977125 345.338000 maybe the people who uh bought term insurance aren't going to lose anything except a few months premium but all those um people who have money invested in uh uh annuities
sw2779A-ms98-a-0080 345.338000 350.994875 for their retirement are going to be up a creek and i don't know who's going to bail them out
sw2779A-ms98-a-0081 350.994875 351.797875 [silence]
sw2779A-ms98-a-0082 351.797875 362.410000 there al[ready]- there already a few companies that had switched over from their own private plans to the first executive annuities that are not getting their benefit checks this time
sw2779A-ms98-a-0083 362.410000 364.142625 [silence]
sw2779A-ms98-a-0084 364.142625 372.018000 and the the state governor is saying that we're going to protect those people but how are we going to do that
sw2779A-ms98-a-0085 372.018000 384.159875 where the state itself is already in hock uh we're running thirteen million dollars no billion sorry thirteen billion dollars in the hole for the next fiscal year
sw2779A-ms98-a-0086 384.159875 393.674875 and you know we've got to come up with that money because_1 states can't run a deficit the way the federal government can and they're going to have to be laying people off out here in the state
sw2779A-ms98-a-0087 393.674875 402.274375 some of [laughter-whom] i [laughter-don't] think anybody will [laughter-miss] but when it gets down to teachers and cops it make a difference
sw2779A-ms98-a-0088 402.274375 407.171375 [silence]
sw2779A-ms98-a-0089 407.171375 408.487875 well the
sw2779A-ms98-a-0090 408.487875 409.920875 [silence]
sw2779A-ms98-a-0091 409.920875 422.904625 yeah i think that's absolutely [vocalized-noise] they keep all their fancy uh perks in the legislature and they uh still do their [vocalized-noise] and they still have all their uh 
sw2779A-ms98-a-0092 422.904625 428.755750 i think it's something like twenty five uh people on the payroll per a legislator
sw2779A-ms98-a-0093 428.755750 443.217750 yeah i i came fr[om]- out here to California from Texas and i can very well remember people trying to change the Texas legislature to meet every year instead of every other year as the Texas constitution requires and people
sw2779A-ms98-a-0094 443.217750 451.597750 consistently voted it down and since they [laughter-do] [laughter-enough] [laughter-damage] [laughter-every] [laughter-two] [laughter-years] [laughter-think] [laughter-of] [laughter-where] [laughter-we'd] [laughter-be] [laughter-if] [laughter-we] [laughter-let] [laughter-them] [laughter-meet] [laughter-yearly]
sw2779A-ms98-a-0095 451.597750 455.757000 [laughter-and] i really feel that way about the California ones too
sw2779A-ms98-a-0096 455.757000 466.510000 tha[t]- i- i think that if they could all just take about a five year vacation and let things settle down maybe we could figure out what exactly we need and start over
sw2779A-ms98-a-0097 466.510000 468.659625 [silence]
sw2779A-ms98-a-0098 468.659625 470.896000 but anyway [laughter]
