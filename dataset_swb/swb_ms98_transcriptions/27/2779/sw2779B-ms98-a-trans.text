sw2779B-ms98-a-0003 5.187375 6.094375 [silence]
sw2779B-ms98-a-0004 6.094375 6.947000 yes
sw2779B-ms98-a-0005 6.947000 9.674500 [silence]
sw2779B-ms98-a-0006 9.674500 11.288000 oh absolutely
sw2779B-ms98-a-0007 11.288000 11.866125 [silence]
sw2779B-ms98-a-0008 11.866125 15.716125 i i think uh it's all Congress' fault
sw2779B-ms98-a-0009 15.716125 25.794000 [silence]
sw2779B-ms98-a-0010 25.794000 32.891875 yep and i think the real problem wasn't the regulation which i supported but that they failed to similarly deregulate the insurance
sw2779B-ms98-a-0011 32.891875 43.585000 i mean i think that was the real mistake they should have seen that coming it's that was like giving away free money oh sure we'll continue to in[sure]- insure you cheaply but you can you know do whatever you want with the way you loan the money
sw2779B-ms98-a-0012 43.585000 51.240500 and it should've been do whatever you want with the way you loan the money and by the way when you buy insurance you know they're going to be looking at how you do it
sw2779B-ms98-a-0013 51.240500 51.892250 [silence]
sw2779B-ms98-a-0014 51.892250 56.260750 right and then the guys who want to spend it that way sure they'll pay more for insurance
sw2779B-ms98-a-0015 56.260750 67.737750 [silence]
sw2779B-ms98-a-0016 67.737750 68.676000 yep

sw2779B-ms98-a-0022 91.663375 93.109625 absolutely
sw2779B-ms98-a-0023 93.109625 96.136625 absolutely because_1 i mean their return is guaranteed
sw2779B-ms98-a-0024 96.136625 98.908125 [silence]
sw2779B-ms98-a-0025 98.908125 100.053375 yeah

sw2779B-ms98-a-0032 110.398125 113.833875 [silence]
sw2779B-ms98-a-0033 113.833875 116.641000 sure in fact they've got a strong incentive to uh
sw2779B-ms98-a-0034 116.641000 124.398375 you know guarantee your money your deposits at six percent and go ahead and invest it in you know the junkiest bonds possible where the theoretical rate of return is high
sw2779B-ms98-a-0035 124.398375 130.838750 uh because if they win they win big and if they don't who cares [laughter] they don't loose right
sw2779B-ms98-a-0036 130.838750 149.472625 [silence]
sw2779B-ms98-a-0037 149.472625 153.180250 yep yep i agree with you there too uh
sw2779B-ms98-a-0038 153.180250 157.343375 this this the whole concept of too big to fail it's just silly
sw2779B-ms98-a-0039 157.343375 158.169375 [silence]
sw2779B-ms98-a-0040 158.169375 159.201875 yep
sw2779B-ms98-a-0041 159.201875 163.351750 [silence]
sw2779B-ms98-a-0042 163.351750 164.531625 right
sw2779B-ms98-a-0043 164.531625 167.151625 [silence]
sw2779B-ms98-a-0044 167.151625 175.113125 that's right and i also think the first thing they should've clarified was that the tax payer would give you a hundred thousand dollar maximum i don't care how many accounts you've got 
sw2779B-ms98-a-0045 175.113125 184.981375 [silence]
sw2779B-ms98-a-0046 184.981375 186.061000 right
sw2779B-ms98-a-0047 186.061000 191.311625 [silence]
sw2779B-ms98-a-0048 191.311625 195.027000 that's right and i mean it would've put these money brokers out of business
sw2779B-ms98-a-0049 195.027000 198.742375 which i mean certainly contributed um-hum
sw2779B-ms98-a-0050 198.742375 199.838875 [silence]
sw2779B-ms98-a-0051 199.838875 201.055500 yep
sw2779B-ms98-a-0052 201.055500 204.023500 [silence]
sw2779B-ms98-a-0053 204.023500 205.204375 um-hum
sw2779B-ms98-a-0054 205.204375 217.985250 i mean if you invest in stocks or whatever you know it's it's not just the responsibility of the broker it's your responsibility you know to know what you're investing in and the kinds of risks you're taking and it seems to me if you're going to put more than a hundred thousand dollars or whatever the limit's going to be
sw2779B-ms98-a-0055 217.985250 231.896250 in a bank that you should be aware i mean it's one thing to have insurance when you're protecting the little guy who doesn't have the time to make or the expertise to make these sorts of decisions but it's another thing to be you know supposedly you would think hope that the big depositors like
sw2779B-ms98-a-0056 231.896250 235.985250 voters and everybody else are supposed to be educated about what they're getting into
sw2779B-ms98-a-0057 235.985250 247.874500 [silence]

sw2779B-ms98-a-0061 254.343500 270.396250 [silence]
sw2779B-ms98-a-0062 270.396250 272.275750 that's right yeah
sw2779B-ms98-a-0063 272.275750 285.782875 yeah i mean there is like for the brokerage houses there is a degree of insurance that the brokerage won't go bankrupt and you'll lose your money but there's certainly no guarantee that for example uh the commercial paper that the money market you invest in won't become worthless and your and your stock price will go down
sw2779B-ms98-a-0064 285.782875 287.374500 and that's fair enough
sw2779B-ms98-a-0065 287.374500 295.376500 [silence]
sw2779B-ms98-a-0066 295.376500 301.815375 uh yes i mean there's got to be long long term consequences over this you know just because
sw2779B-ms98-a-0067 301.815375 306.689625 reimbursing this is going to be a substantial cost the banks are failing because of all their
sw2779B-ms98-a-0068 306.689625 314.241500 accounts that were these you know savings and loans and stuff right um so i mean this things just got to spread
sw2779B-ms98-a-0069 314.241500 320.797500 [silence]
sw2779B-ms98-a-0070 320.797500 321.867750 um-hum
