sw2731B-ms98-a-0003 2.946500 7.686500 i have pretty strong feelings about it yeah i think that guns ought to be controlled
sw2731B-ms98-a-0004 7.686500 12.704125 [silence]
sw2731B-ms98-a-0005 12.704125 20.305000 well let's see on one to ten i guess i vary i actually started out as a member of the NRA in my youth
sw2731B-ms98-a-0006 20.305000 32.079125 but having looked at murder statistics in other countries um it's so dramatic that i think that i'm probably down to about a two or a three
sw2731B-ms98-a-0007 32.079125 37.286625 in terms of control however no i'm sorry maybe up to a [laughter-nine] or a ten
sw2731B-ms98-a-0008 37.286625 38.248125 [laughter]
sw2731B-ms98-a-0009 38.248125 39.569125 [silence]
sw2731B-ms98-a-0010 39.569125 54.246750 um open the almanac one day and it just has murders of by by guns and you look and you look at European countries and and it's like six eleven four and you get to the US and it's four thousand
sw2731B-ms98-a-0011 54.246750 56.681125 and that tells me something about
sw2731B-ms98-a-0012 56.681125 61.535750 [silence]
sw2731B-ms98-a-0013 61.535750 62.754000 yeah that

sw2731B-ms98-a-0015 63.538875 64.777875 [silence]
sw2731B-ms98-a-0016 64.777875 72.659000 that's i mean the other problem is there's so many guns out there if you ban sales of guns right now there'd still be millions and millions and millions of them_1
sw2731B-ms98-a-0017 72.659000 74.115250 but uh
sw2731B-ms98-a-0018 74.115250 82.929875 would it would really be nice to make it a little harder to get one so that every punk in the world doesn't doesn't pack a rod

sw2731B-ms98-a-0027 123.801125 132.813250 yeah i think i think that you're right it would be the pretty much the same problem that that prohibition [noise] is [laughter-in] [laughter-fact] pretty much the same problem that drug control is
sw2731B-ms98-a-0028 132.813250 136.019875 if enough people want it and they're willing to pay for it they'll get it

sw2731B-ms98-a-0034 160.846000 168.818125 yeah that's certainly true i mean i own a handgun myself [noise] i've actually never fired the thing but
sw2731B-ms98-a-0035 168.818125 170.353125 but um
sw2731B-ms98-a-0036 170.353125 175.285625 but i went out and bought it intending to to learn to use it and so on but i never did

sw2731B-ms98-a-0043 195.723625 206.069875 yeah i mean i certainly just walked into the store and bought mine and a box of bullets i suppose i could have gone and blown my own brains out or anyone [laughter-else's] who was who was nearby
sw2731B-ms98-a-0044 206.069875 207.094000 [silence]
sw2731B-ms98-a-0045 207.094000 210.203500 although i must say i have a healthy respect for the thing
sw2731B-ms98-a-0046 210.203500 220.223000 [silence]
sw2731B-ms98-a-0047 220.223000 221.029000 yeah
sw2731B-ms98-a-0048 221.029000 229.276250 [silence]
sw2731B-ms98-a-0049 229.276250 232.420250 yeah it's um
sw2731B-ms98-a-0050 232.420250 245.845500 it sort of amazes me that that in the Gulf War people were really concerned about ten or twenty or thirty or a hundred people dying and if a thousand people died in that war it would have been a mess and if five thousand had died
sw2731B-ms98-a-0051 245.845500 259.123250 it would have been considered a national calamity and yet that many people die uh from gunshot wounds i mean i think that we have our values in a in a sort of in in a funny place
sw2731B-ms98-a-0052 259.123250 273.773875 [silence]
sw2731B-ms98-a-0053 273.773875 280.506875 yeah i mean in some in some fields we seem to have this really profound respect for human life
sw2731B-ms98-a-0054 280.506875 286.491625 and in other fields we don't i think guns and automobiles are the two places where we're willing to take our licks
sw2731B-ms98-a-0055 286.491625 290.891500 but you know we're willing to accept sixty thousand highway deaths a year
sw2731B-ms98-a-0056 290.891500 299.925500 [silence]
sw2731B-ms98-a-0057 299.925500 301.458875 [noise]

sw2731B-ms98-a-0061 312.100125 317.301000 yeah in some areas but i think in other areas um
sw2731B-ms98-a-0062 317.301000 323.742625 i don't know i guess this this this this Gulf War came to mind where where um
sw2731B-ms98-a-0063 323.742625 333.797625 well war just comes to mind [noise] you know couple a hundred people get get blown up and it's and it really shakes the country to it's roots maybe just because of the way it happens
sw2731B-ms98-a-0064 333.797625 334.820875 [silence]
sw2731B-ms98-a-0065 334.820875 336.100375 and uh
sw2731B-ms98-a-0066 336.100375 349.371125 but you know we'll go all out uh to save uh a child with a rare disease who makes the newspaper will get millions of dollars in contributions and and all kinds of medical aid because that one life is considered so precious
sw2731B-ms98-a-0067 349.371125 361.822250 when it's viewed somehow when it's viewed in i don't know as as a single life it becomes very precious and when you view it as a statistic whether it's guns or automobiles or smoking um
sw2731B-ms98-a-0068 361.822250 368.690125 people just don't see those as individual lives somehow or they don't they don't uh relate to them personally
sw2731B-ms98-a-0069 368.690125 379.542750 [silence]
sw2731B-ms98-a-0070 379.542750 380.563000 yeah

sw2731B-ms98-a-0076 398.348250 405.260000 yeah they are and and it's really changing the social structure of things i know i went out with a bunch of people
sw2731B-ms98-a-0077 405.260000 411.969250 i don't know six or seven people and we were just sitting around drinking beer and the waitress [laughter-asked] us which one was driving she didn't want to
sw2731B-ms98-a-0078 411.969250 414.448000 wasn't going to serve that person anything
sw2731B-ms98-a-0079 414.448000 417.946375 [silence]
sw2731B-ms98-a-0080 417.946375 421.151375 hm yeah i didn't think about that i sort of thought that

sw2731B-ms98-a-0084 428.443000 437.775625 yeah i thought that was the case i mean if uh if my kid grabs my gun and goes and shoots somebody i would really have the feeling that they're going to come banging on my door
sw2731B-ms98-a-0085 437.775625 446.008875 [silence]
sw2731B-ms98-a-0086 446.008875 447.232625 huh

sw2731B-ms98-a-0094 510.131125 521.588875 yeah it's well it's just too late i mean there are countries i've lived in both Japan and England where guns are not available even criminals don't carry them or it's so hard to get and the
sw2731B-ms98-a-0095 521.588875 527.018000 and the law is so severe for people caught using them that by and large uh they don't

sw2731B-ms98-a-0103 551.986250 563.653250 no i think by the [laughter] by the the the year nineteen hundred there were probably enough guns in the US i mean it's just always been a way of life here the wild wild west

sw2731B-ms98-a-0107 578.397375 587.913125 well yeah that's uh that's a point although uh if that's the case why are we spending all this money on all of this high tech weaponry i wonder
sw2731B-ms98-a-0108 587.913125 592.021750 [silence]
