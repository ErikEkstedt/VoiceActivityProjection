sw2731A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.112250 [noise]
sw2731A-ms98-a-0002 0.112250 0.812375 [silence]
sw2731A-ms98-a-0003 0.812375 2.758000 do you have any strong feelings about gun control
sw2731A-ms98-a-0004 2.758000 8.000000 [silence]
sw2731A-ms98-a-0005 8.000000 13.125500 uh i agree there should be some control but uh how strong of uh a control do you think there ought to be
sw2731A-ms98-a-0006 13.125500 32.466500 [silence]
sw2731A-ms98-a-0007 32.466500 34.341000 uh
sw2731A-ms98-a-0008 34.341000 35.515500 okay
sw2731A-ms98-a-0009 35.515500 39.353250 that's [laughter] yeah okay got the scale going the other way
sw2731A-ms98-a-0010 39.353250 53.638125 [silence]
sw2731A-ms98-a-0011 53.638125 54.784750 sure
sw2731A-ms98-a-0012 54.784750 57.042875 [silence]
sw2731A-ms98-a-0013 57.042875 63.378750 but if you make owning a a gun a crime only criminals will have guns i've heard that before and that's probably true
sw2731A-ms98-a-0014 63.378750 71.699000 [silence]
sw2731A-ms98-a-0015 71.699000 73.870375 sure uh
sw2731A-ms98-a-0016 73.870375 82.516500 [silence]
sw2731A-ms98-a-0017 82.516500 92.741750 yeah i agree with that i think that some states are just far too lenient uh Texas and Florida are very easy on uh gun ownership being able to buy guns all it takes is a driver's license
sw2731A-ms98-a-0018 92.741750 97.038375 and uh sign an affidavit uh saying that you didn't commit any felonies
sw2731A-ms98-a-0019 97.038375 107.619875 so i think that ought to be uh tightened up i favor uh uh holding uh the guns say for for seven days or whatever until uh you can check out whether somebody is legitimate or not
sw2731A-ms98-a-0020 107.619875 108.794500 [silence]
sw2731A-ms98-a-0021 108.794500 119.652000 and i think that might stop some of the uh impulsive crimes but uh things that like that are planned uh selling guns to New York City things of that nature i don't think you're ever going to be able to stop that
sw2731A-ms98-a-0022 119.652000 124.198000 there's just too much of a demand and people are going to get ahold of guns no matter what the restrictions are
sw2731A-ms98-a-0023 124.198000 131.777375 [silence]
sw2731A-ms98-a-0024 131.777375 132.978125 yeah
sw2731A-ms98-a-0025 132.978125 135.174875 [silence]
sw2731A-ms98-a-0026 135.174875 146.835125 and a lot of people own guns just as a hobby and uh hunters in particular they're they're not uh buying guns to commit any crimes at all just uh uh pursuing their hobby
sw2731A-ms98-a-0027 146.835125 153.867000 [laughter] but it it's uh ones uh say the midnight specials uh uh
sw2731A-ms98-a-0028 153.867000 161.221125 the s[emi]- semi automatic weapons uh assault rifles things like that that uh really have no place uh for a sportsman
sw2731A-ms98-a-0029 161.221125 167.348625 [silence]
sw2731A-ms98-a-0030 167.348625 168.521750 uh-huh
sw2731A-ms98-a-0031 168.521750 174.920750 [silence]
sw2731A-ms98-a-0032 174.920750 189.846375 yeah i don't see any problem with owning a gun for self protection but uh education is is a big part of that people need to be educated on how to uh how to how to store their weapons uh so the kids can't get at them and so they're not a threat to the rest of the family
sw2731A-ms98-a-0033 189.846375 195.607500 a lot of people don't get that type of education they don't have any k[ind]- type of safeguards on their weapons at home
sw2731A-ms98-a-0034 195.607500 203.977500 [silence]
sw2731A-ms98-a-0035 203.977500 205.736500 [laughter]
sw2731A-ms98-a-0036 205.736500 206.703375 yeah
sw2731A-ms98-a-0037 206.703375 209.714500 [silence]
sw2731A-ms98-a-0038 209.714500 220.814500 yeah uh gun control legislation is uh is really tough to beat i mean the NRA is so strong and they lobby uh uh a lot in Congress
sw2731A-ms98-a-0039 220.814500 228.444875 so uh it's going to be really tough to uh add uh gun control type of laws to what we already have
sw2731A-ms98-a-0040 228.444875 247.946375 [silence]
sw2731A-ms98-a-0041 247.946375 249.162375 sure
sw2731A-ms98-a-0042 249.162375 259.080875 [silence]
sw2731A-ms98-a-0043 259.080875 269.736750 yeah uh yeah i'll have to agree with that it uh i never really correlated uh those two incidences say crime at home uh versus an international war
sw2731A-ms98-a-0044 269.736750 271.810500 but uh
sw2731A-ms98-a-0045 271.810500 274.198750 yeah i guess i don't know how to how to place that
sw2731A-ms98-a-0046 274.198750 290.242375 [silence]
sw2731A-ms98-a-0047 290.242375 303.833375 yeah uh that's that's true uh and uh when it gets to the point where it's unacceptable where the majority of the people find it unacceptable they may find cause to write their Congressman and lobby for some stronger controls
sw2731A-ms98-a-0048 303.833375 312.654375 but uh yeah we are very tol[erant]- a very tolerant society and uh it takes a great deal of uh abuse before we get our act together
sw2731A-ms98-a-0049 312.654375 331.155875 [silence]
sw2731A-ms98-a-0050 331.155875 332.280500 right
sw2731A-ms98-a-0051 332.280500 333.532125 [silence]
sw2731A-ms98-a-0052 333.532125 334.673250 uh-huh
sw2731A-ms98-a-0053 334.673250 348.855500 [silence]
sw2731A-ms98-a-0054 348.855500 349.895875 yeah
sw2731A-ms98-a-0055 349.895875 368.828875 [silence]
sw2731A-ms98-a-0056 368.828875 380.346250 i think it depends on uh who's leading the crusade and how strong they feel about it take for instance Mothers Against Drunk Driving that used to be just a very small organization started by a housewife
sw2731A-ms98-a-0057 380.346250 386.090625 and now it's a national organization they they're very powerful uh they collect a lot of money [laughter]
sw2731A-ms98-a-0058 386.090625 395.363000 and uh it i think it's made an impact i mean it it's made a lot of people cut down on their their drinking and driving because the laws are enforced stronger now
sw2731A-ms98-a-0059 395.363000 398.380250 DWI convictions are very serious
sw2731A-ms98-a-0060 398.380250 410.726750 [silence]
sw2731A-ms98-a-0061 410.726750 411.697625 right
sw2731A-ms98-a-0062 411.697625 413.640750 [silence]
sw2731A-ms98-a-0063 413.640750 419.429750 because uh they're liable anybody who serves anything to anybody is liable can be sued
sw2731A-ms98-a-0064 419.429750 421.055250 [silence]
sw2731A-ms98-a-0065 421.055250 423.378000 with guns i think it ought to be the same way
sw2731A-ms98-a-0066 423.378000 427.880500 i think people who own guns ought to be held responsible for things that happen with those weapons
sw2731A-ms98-a-0067 427.880500 437.265250 [silence]
sw2731A-ms98-a-0068 437.265250 446.628625 well i saw a talk show just the other night where uh there was a mother on the show and her uh son had been killed in a neighbor's house by one of the neighbor's handguns
sw2731A-ms98-a-0069 446.628625 458.664375 when only the other kids were at home they apparently had three handguns that were uh in plain sight one on top of the refrigerator one in the on the bedroom dresser and one somewhere else but uh
sw2731A-ms98-a-0070 458.664375 465.343125 just teenagers and uh and grade school kids at home and one of the kids got shot by a gun got killed
sw2731A-ms98-a-0071 465.343125 471.076750 and apparently no charges were filed against the owner of the gun who happened to be a police officer [laughter]
sw2731A-ms98-a-0072 471.076750 475.920000 [silence]
sw2731A-ms98-a-0073 475.920000 485.323875 so it's i guess they say accidents will happen and uh [laughter] uh you know it's just hard to say who's at fault for uh things like that that happen
sw2731A-ms98-a-0074 485.323875 486.395250 [silence]
sw2731A-ms98-a-0075 486.395250 489.389000 but somebody's got to be uh um
sw2731A-ms98-a-0076 489.389000 491.673125 somebody's got to be held responsible
sw2731A-ms98-a-0077 491.673125 493.319000 ultimately
sw2731A-ms98-a-0078 493.319000 494.724875 [silence]
sw2731A-ms98-a-0079 494.724875 502.106500 so i don't know i think the law should be tightened up on on gun ownership but i can't see a total ban on it at all uh
sw2731A-ms98-a-0080 502.106500 510.046750 because_1 then you're still going to have uh criminals with guns [laughter-and] it's not going to help uh the situation uh there people want to break the law they're going to do it 
sw2731A-ms98-a-0081 510.046750 526.266625 [silence]
sw2731A-ms98-a-0082 526.266625 532.358750 well they have a lot tighter controls on importing things of that nature too you can't get them_1 through airports uh
sw2731A-ms98-a-0083 532.358750 533.508750 [silence]
sw2731A-ms98-a-0084 533.508750 542.149250 you know like in uh Germany in the airports there where there uh where terrorism is so much of a threat uh the uh policemen have uh automatic weapons [laughter]
sw2731A-ms98-a-0085 542.149250 550.157625 you know and uh i don't know what the penalties are for trying to smuggle guns into a country like that but i imagine they're quite severe
sw2731A-ms98-a-0086 550.157625 561.049375 [silence]
sw2731A-ms98-a-0087 561.049375 562.527875 right
sw2731A-ms98-a-0088 562.527875 571.589000 well i've heard it said that that's one of the reasons why we're not as much a threat to be attacked by other countries because everybody and his brother's got a gun at home
sw2731A-ms98-a-0089 571.589000 575.985500 and what are you going to do about that You got two hundred million guns here and [laughter]
sw2731A-ms98-a-0090 575.985500 578.342500 it's uh it's more than just an army
sw2731A-ms98-a-0091 578.342500 587.945125 [silence]
sw2731A-ms98-a-0092 587.945125 593.290250 well there that's your your professional army uh that's your first line of defense [laughter]
sw2731A-ms98-a-0093 593.290250 594.155500 uh
sw2731A-ms98-a-0094 594.155500 599.619125 that that's for your your mercenary forces that go acro[ss]- overseas and and attack other countries but at at home here
