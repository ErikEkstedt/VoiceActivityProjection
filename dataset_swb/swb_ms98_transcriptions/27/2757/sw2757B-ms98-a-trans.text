sw2757B-ms98-a-0016 67.446125 79.636375 that's correct i don't know how maybe i- that's i agree one hundred percent i just uh what irritates me i guess is that they keep wanting to pass gun control laws that do nothing but take away your your constitutional amendments
sw2757B-ms98-a-0017 79.636375 83.218750 and that is that is really not gun control is not the problem
sw2757B-ms98-a-0018 83.218750 85.151750 it's the people using the guns
sw2757B-ms98-a-0019 85.151750 86.166375 [silence]
sw2757B-ms98-a-0020 86.166375 88.911000 and all they're doing is look at this new Brady Bill
sw2757B-ms98-a-0021 88.911000 93.478625 the seven day waiting period that does not deter anybody who really that wants to buy a gun
sw2757B-ms98-a-0022 93.478625 94.939250 there's spots here in Austin

sw2757B-ms98-a-0033 111.485750 116.288125 you can make two phone calls if you know if you know anybody here in town uh

sw2757B-ms98-a-0036 120.864375 123.008125 the law's just you know it's
sw2757B-ms98-a-0037 123.008125 128.102000 they can't enforce what they have you know and i'm not a big fan of Peter Jennings peculiarly
sw2757B-ms98-a-0038 128.102000 135.523875 but he was on one of the on the talk shows one time they had Kennedy on there and Brady Mrs Gonzalez and some of the other liberals but you know
sw2757B-ms98-a-0039 135.523875 146.160000 and he he pulled this big stack of papers out that was about oh four feet tall he said these are all the current gun laws you have the books if you can't enforce these why do you think you can pass another one and enforce it
sw2757B-ms98-a-0040 146.160000 147.901250 but uh
sw2757B-ms98-a-0041 147.901250 160.527125 the Brady Bill won't do anything but just make it harder for the people that are honest to buy one th[ose]- those that are criminals which are the ones that are refusing guns in the first place uh they're not going to walk in and buy one anyway
sw2757B-ms98-a-0042 160.527125 173.581250 [silence]
sw2757B-ms98-a-0043 173.581250 177.411750 well uh the uh the proper solution is education of the masses 
sw2757B-ms98-a-0044 177.411750 180.765875 you've got to educate the people in in using the weapons
sw2757B-ms98-a-0045 180.765875 185.927250 and you know our forefathers you know everybody carried a gun here in Texas
sw2757B-ms98-a-0046 185.927250 188.767250 you know for you know a couple of hundred years

sw2757B-ms98-a-0048 191.387625 193.270000 that's true unless of course there was you know
sw2757B-ms98-a-0049 193.270000 205.483375 su[fficient]- sufficient provocation which we have basically the same thing now it's just that all the honest people you know the citizens as it were no longer carry guns to defend themselves because on[ly]- only the criminals are
sw2757B-ms98-a-0050 205.483375 208.296250 [silence]

sw2757B-ms98-a-0055 217.801500 227.919000 and i go up and help him you know work in the store and stuff like that and it it's amazing the number of people that are buying guns and the reason they're buying them is they want to give their wife one to carry in the car with them
sw2757B-ms98-a-0056 227.919000 234.552125 and that some of the woman will come in and they'll look around and they'll try and find a small one to fit inside their purse

sw2757B-ms98-a-0075 306.698500 312.573250 uh it's because of guns no it's not because of the guns it's because of the people and and actually they're breaking in
sw2757B-ms98-a-0076 312.573250 323.672625 to the homes and and using weapons uh to buy drugs although you do have those that you know like the idiot who ran out and grabbed that AK-47 and shot everybody up at the McDonald's in California
sw2757B-ms98-a-0077 323.672625 324.910250 [silence]
sw2757B-ms98-a-0078 324.910250 331.084125 you know that you know we're talking about somebody whose crazy having a gun law is not going to stop him because he's going to find one
sw2757B-ms98-a-0079 331.084125 332.810375 and uh
sw2757B-ms98-a-0080 332.810375 335.790750 yeah well you know uh California
sw2757B-ms98-a-0081 335.790750 340.130750 California Hawaii and New York state have these and uh
sw2757B-ms98-a-0082 340.130750 342.842125 now New Jersey had the stiffest gun laws
sw2757B-ms98-a-0083 342.842125 347.796500 oh yeah but you know where where are the most crimes committed New York state
sw2757B-ms98-a-0084 347.796500 351.569500 as you know uh John Lennon was you know you know was shot and killed
sw2757B-ms98-a-0085 351.569500 356.348625 in uh New York by a guy that bought a gun i[n]- in Hawaii which has a tough gun law
sw2757B-ms98-a-0086 356.348625 357.702625 [silence]
sw2757B-ms98-a-0087 357.702625 364.912125 and you know i mean this clown out in uh California he uh he had a criminal record you know a mile long
sw2757B-ms98-a-0088 364.912125 366.436375 [silence]
sw2757B-ms98-a-0089 366.436375 369.140125 but he still had not one but several
sw2757B-ms98-a-0090 369.140125 373.727125 and there was one not too long ago [vocalized-noise] in the last six months uh
sw2757B-ms98-a-0091 373.727125 379.889000 he shot up that Allstate or or or that GMC credit place in Florida
sw2757B-ms98-a-0092 379.889000 382.812250 well he went out and bought six different guns
sw2757B-ms98-a-0093 382.812250 384.690500 you know and he had a criminal record
sw2757B-ms98-a-0094 384.690500 389.217375 [silence]
sw2757B-ms98-a-0095 389.217375 390.263250 oh yeah
sw2757B-ms98-a-0096 390.263250 394.903625 [silence]
sw2757B-ms98-a-0097 394.903625 396.400500 and there are peop[le]-
sw2757B-ms98-a-0098 396.400500 404.667750 yeah they're people doing that so i mean the the solution is not to pass more laws than you can't enforce because they're they're going to pass one now they're trying too either the Staggers Bill or the Brady Bill
sw2757B-ms98-a-0099 404.667750 408.347625 either way they do it it's going to cost you and me more money
sw2757B-ms98-a-0100 408.347625 413.589000 be[cause]- and and and we're going to increase the bureaucracy that's supposed to handle it and
sw2757B-ms98-a-0101 413.589000 421.507125 what are they going to do they're going to punch your name in the computer and you're going to come up as no you're not a criminal and no and no you have no criminal record you know and yeah you can by gun
sw2757B-ms98-a-0102 421.507125 425.751125 but that doesn't say that you're not going to walk outside and three days later shoot somebody
sw2757B-ms98-a-0103 425.751125 426.851000 [silence]
sw2757B-ms98-a-0104 426.851000 429.092875 you know there's no substitute for people
sw2757B-ms98-a-0105 429.092875 430.134250 oh yeah
sw2757B-ms98-a-0106 430.134250 434.190000 [silence]
sw2757B-ms98-a-0107 434.190000 439.964625 actually guns are not the prime uh weapon used in killing people in crimes of passion or whatever
sw2757B-ms98-a-0108 439.964625 441.864625 it's knives and baseball bats
sw2757B-ms98-a-0109 441.864625 443.079125 [silence]
sw2757B-ms98-a-0110 443.079125 443.767000 yeah

sw2757B-ms98-a-0112 445.002250 446.443750 [silence]
sw2757B-ms98-a-0113 446.443750 451.299875 see you can walk down the street carrying a baseball bat and nobody thinks anything about it
sw2757B-ms98-a-0114 451.299875 455.545875 you know and how many times have you seen people walking down the street carrying a baseball bat
sw2757B-ms98-a-0115 455.545875 458.334125 you figure what little leaguers on their way to practice
sw2757B-ms98-a-0116 458.334125 461.444875 they could be gang members just as easy
sw2757B-ms98-a-0117 461.444875 462.802250 if you
sw2757B-ms98-a-0118 462.802250 465.320625 oh yeah it's uh it's quite a deal
sw2757B-ms98-a-0119 465.320625 467.639125 nobody pays attention to a baseball bat
sw2757B-ms98-a-0120 467.639125 468.878875 you know
sw2757B-ms98-a-0121 468.878875 475.138500 and you you [vocalized-noise] you see a baseball bat in the back of the car and nobody no cops going to give you a ticket for a baseball bat in the back of your car 
sw2757B-ms98-a-0122 475.138500 476.192375 [silence]
sw2757B-ms98-a-0123 476.192375 477.829375 yeah so why you know
sw2757B-ms98-a-0124 477.829375 479.227750 yeah
sw2757B-ms98-a-0125 479.227750 484.937625 or knives you can have knives everybody's got knives course you course you're limited you know you can't have switchblades and stuff
sw2757B-ms98-a-0126 484.937625 485.807875 but uh
sw2757B-ms98-a-0127 485.807875 489.003875 uh you know guns are used but so is everything else
sw2757B-ms98-a-0128 489.003875 495.726500 if you're going to ban that if you're going to band guns i've got an article in the Wall Street Journal where they had where they had uh used a satire
sw2757B-ms98-a-0129 495.726500 501.230625 where someone in New York had suggested all the guns because they were used for commission of drug regulated crimes
sw2757B-ms98-a-0130 501.230625 504.099000 and they immediately decided well lets start banning the public telephones
sw2757B-ms98-a-0131 504.099000 504.727625 bless you
sw2757B-ms98-a-0132 504.727625 505.910625 [silence]
sw2757B-ms98-a-0133 505.910625 511.809250 and they said well let's band the public telephones too because the public telephones are used in the commission of drug related crimes
sw2757B-ms98-a-0134 511.809250 513.532000 makes about as much sense
sw2757B-ms98-a-0135 513.532000 514.519125 [silence]
sw2757B-ms98-a-0136 514.519125 521.135125 but you know the to my way of thinking you know uh i'm a i'm you know i put blood on the ground you know [vocalized-noise] the United States
sw2757B-ms98-a-0137 521.135125 528.484875 and uh if th[e]- if the United States does not trust me enough to have a gun after that then i don't trust them enough to govern me
sw2757B-ms98-a-0138 528.484875 529.718625 [silence]
sw2757B-ms98-a-0139 529.718625 532.029500 but i'm kind of radical on that i just you know
sw2757B-ms98-a-0140 532.029500 533.867250 [silence]
sw2757B-ms98-a-0141 533.867250 543.052000 well i i see too much of it and i see people come into the shop up there and you know and i buy guns and they haven't got the faintest idea what you are doing
sw2757B-ms98-a-0142 543.052000 549.260750 you know and they want to buy a gun now i think there should be some sort of uh ID card that you carry
sw2757B-ms98-a-0143 549.260750 551.775875 [silence]
sw2757B-ms98-a-0144 551.775875 554.314000 there's an application you fill out now
sw2757B-ms98-a-0145 554.314000 555.694125 it's a yellow form
sw2757B-ms98-a-0146 555.694125 564.658000 but uh see that's it's just another piece of paperwork it asks for your name your address and phone number and the county where you birth and all and you know and then there's a list of ten questions you answer and
sw2757B-ms98-a-0147 564.658000 567.286625 if you answer no to all of them that means you're a good American
sw2757B-ms98-a-0148 567.286625 569.940000 you such um seriously and
sw2757B-ms98-a-0149 569.940000 577.415375 it's a little yellow form you fill out and it puts the name and the serial number the gun who bought it and the date like that and that stays in the gun shop and it never goes anywhere
sw2757B-ms98-a-0150 577.415375 580.770000 it stays right there we've got boxes full in the back room
sw2757B-ms98-a-0151 580.770000 587.714875 and and the only thing that it's used for is if uh if Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms come down and does an inspection
