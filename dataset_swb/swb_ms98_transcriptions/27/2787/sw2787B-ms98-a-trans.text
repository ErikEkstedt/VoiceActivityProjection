sw2787B-ms98-a-0124 487.330000 493.683375 problem books you know mate and foremoves and that sort of thing which i enjoy but uh
sw2787B-ms98-a-0125 493.683375 504.297125 i didn't have a uh anyone else around me uh when i was growing up that was all that interested in chess i know all the moves and i can follow the game and that sort of thing and enjoy watching
sw2787B-ms98-a-0126 504.297125 506.202125 experts play
sw2787B-ms98-a-0127 506.202125 508.816375 i participated one time with a uh
sw2787B-ms98-a-0128 508.816375 510.217250 grand master
sw2787B-ms98-a-0129 510.217250 513.819875 we used to have a chess club at Texas Instruments and uh
sw2787B-ms98-a-0130 513.819875 517.540250 we actually had a grand master in the area who came out and
sw2787B-ms98-a-0131 517.540250 520.870000 played all of us [laughter] simultaneously you know
sw2787B-ms98-a-0132 520.870000 533.004625 and he also played us uh blindfold chess one one one on uh one [noise] and uh as the game was going along uh he says uh
sw2787B-ms98-a-0133 533.004625 546.059375 mate in six and if you play chess you know six is a long way ahead [laughter] and uh we all looked at the board and couldn't figure out how he could possibly mate six and sure enough he mated in six just like he said he would
sw2787B-ms98-a-0134 546.059375 548.791000 [laughter] yeah
sw2787B-ms98-a-0135 548.791000 554.805750 but he played us uh on a round robin where he walks around the tables and plays everybody
sw2787B-ms98-a-0136 554.805750 559.136500 oh it's been several years ago like uh probably ten years
sw2787B-ms98-a-0137 559.136500 560.246500 [silence]
sw2787B-ms98-a-0138 560.246500 572.376125 no it's too long ago uh i really don't but he was he was something else we had one member who's really uh in the professional class if you will he used to go to the matches all the time
sw2787B-ms98-a-0139 572.376125 573.819750 and his
sw2787B-ms98-a-0140 573.819750 579.968250 let's see i've forgotten let's see the grand master and then right out of that's master what's the one that's just under master
sw2787B-ms98-a-0141 579.968250 582.584625 expert yeah he was expert
sw2787B-ms98-a-0142 582.584625 587.456375 so uh he gave him a run for his money when he he had to be playing all of us but
sw2787B-ms98-a-0143 587.456375 599.770000 if he passed you uh twice uh you were out in other words if you hadn't moved when he went around so the more members he beat well the faster he got around and uh so Tony the
