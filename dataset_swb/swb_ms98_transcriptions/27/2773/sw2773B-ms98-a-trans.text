sw2773B-ms98-a-0003 7.456125 19.519250 well i i i was uh it was favorable i i just uh i think the sanctions would have worked uh but it would have taken longer and uh now with all this stuff coming out with Woodward's book and everything uh
sw2773B-ms98-a-0004 19.519250 29.807250 and then i saw a Nightline program last night about all the uh funding of uh Hussein uh back as early as eigh[ty]- nineteen eighty six so uh
sw2773B-ms98-a-0005 29.807250 39.147625 -[h]as there been a different turn and then i don't think we projected what was going to happen uh after the war w[ell]- it got over so fast so uh
sw2773B-ms98-a-0006 39.147625 40.499625 [silence]
sw2773B-ms98-a-0007 40.499625 53.007875 well i[t]- uh just came out uh i guess yesterday it's called the Commanders and it's uh it says um big story in the paper about it today Bush trying to comment on it that
sw2773B-ms98-a-0008 53.007875 59.691250 uh Colin Powell was uh was against uh an early uh he he was for sanctions
sw2773B-ms98-a-0009 59.691250 70.600000 and so it seems like there's you know always somebody digging things like that but i'm not for sure we know exactly what what all happened in that situation so uh
sw2773B-ms98-a-0010 70.600000 80.710250 we we were so uh fast to get over the Vietnam whatever the Vietnam syndrome is that i i'm afraid now we've tied ourselves up there in the Middle East for
sw2773B-ms98-a-0011 80.710250 82.748375 a long period of time
sw2773B-ms98-a-0012 82.748375 89.020000 [silence]
sw2773B-ms98-a-0013 89.020000 90.216625 i
sw2773B-ms98-a-0014 90.216625 97.815375 yeah i just think the i think if we had been very i- i mean if he had that good of a correlation through the United Nation[s]- then they could have uh
sw2773B-ms98-a-0015 97.815375 108.021125 they they could have made sanctions work i'm pretty sure uh with that much support you would have just penalized any nation that uh broke the embargo
sw2773B-ms98-a-0016 108.021125 110.954125 [silence]
sw2773B-ms98-a-0017 110.954125 115.256375 we are we are i think uh you know in in uh 
sw2773B-ms98-a-0018 115.256375 127.824875 we've just misread almost everything in that we always seem to be getting in bed with the wrong fellow for the next next tenure or next thing down the road and uh 
sw2773B-ms98-a-0019 127.824875 137.516875 then we can and we don't seem to read Israel correctly so uh i don't know it should be a mess it's uh not going to be anything we're going to get out of very soon
sw2773B-ms98-a-0020 137.516875 138.747000 [silence]
sw2773B-ms98-a-0021 138.747000 139.977250 so
sw2773B-ms98-a-0022 139.977250 146.811250 right that they they can talk a good game but uh being a historian it's uh
sw2773B-ms98-a-0023 146.811250 153.475375 you know you read all that [noise] clear back at least to the turn of the century with all of the mess after first world war
sw2773B-ms98-a-0024 153.475375 166.261875 and we just uh we're still ver[y]- i- i uh y[ou're]- you're absolutely right too naive um we just if we do find so-called experts t[o]- in in any area of the world we don't listen to them_1 so
sw2773B-ms98-a-0025 166.261875 175.057625 um i don't know be be interesting to keep watching i guess but i'm just afraid it's going it's going to break us
sw2773B-ms98-a-0026 175.057625 176.161625 [silence]
sw2773B-ms98-a-0027 176.161625 177.418875 so
sw2773B-ms98-a-0028 177.418875 179.473500 [silence]
sw2773B-ms98-a-0029 179.473500 186.763375 not very much uh i[n]- in our colleges we're trying we're i happen to teach at college with tremendous number of international students and
sw2773B-ms98-a-0030 186.763375 200.898375 and cultural diversity is just something we really don't understand and it's uh it needs to be uh taught from the earliest grades with our school systems in such disarray i don't know if that it doesn't look terribly hopeful
sw2773B-ms98-a-0031 200.898375 203.734625 [silence]
sw2773B-ms98-a-0032 203.734625 215.694125 well you can at least uh g[ive]- g[ive]- uh uh give them_1 the awareness of the different cultures and uh you know have all sorts of um a[t]- at least you know let them know what
sw2773B-ms98-a-0033 215.694125 219.055875 that that other people do things differently than
sw2773B-ms98-a-0034 219.055875 222.406000 than than maybe in their own neighborhood
sw2773B-ms98-a-0035 222.406000 228.972375 so and and when when when those people are around if they if you can get them to meet then we're all pretty much alike
sw2773B-ms98-a-0036 228.972375 230.394750 [silence]
sw2773B-ms98-a-0037 230.394750 231.852750 so uh
sw2773B-ms98-a-0038 231.852750 237.274125 but it's uh it's something a[s]- you know as i said won't go away so uh
sw2773B-ms98-a-0039 237.274125 243.854125 it'll be a good topic for [laughter-me] in the [laughter-class] for a [laughter-long] [laughter-time] since i teach history so
sw2773B-ms98-a-0040 243.854125 250.093250 [silence]
sw2773B-ms98-a-0041 250.093250 264.388625 well i would just think if Bush was so successful in lining up the correlation to prosecute a war then he should be equally successful in getting that same correlation to push the United Nations to um
sw2773B-ms98-a-0042 264.388625 274.226875 uh somehow persuade those nations to give the Kurds a a homeland they were promised that nineteen uh nineteen and that
sw2773B-ms98-a-0043 274.226875 285.002125 well that's the same thing they uh they haven't been waiting quite as long even though they've been waiting since forty eight uh that
sw2773B-ms98-a-0044 285.002125 292.509750 tha[t]- that becomes a different matter simply because you're dealing with Israel and and they seem to be more intractable than ever
sw2773B-ms98-a-0045 292.509750 302.577000 uh that Shamir can't can't retain his leadership if he if he backs down the slightest bit so uh
sw2773B-ms98-a-0046 302.577000 312.511625 i just don't see us uh you know i don't think there's anybody of of major stature on the scene of like some of the great statesman of the past
sw2773B-ms98-a-0047 312.511625 318.278250 or at least we thought they were i'm not for sure that they were they they seem to have gotten us into some of these messes but
sw2773B-ms98-a-0048 318.278250 319.595000 well
sw2773B-ms98-a-0049 319.595000 327.259375 [silence]
sw2773B-ms98-a-0050 327.259375 328.947375 well
sw2773B-ms98-a-0051 328.947375 329.987875 [silence]
sw2773B-ms98-a-0052 329.987875 343.687000 i wish we could stay out of it but but the oil's not going to allow us to we absolutely need that oil that's the major thing if we didn't need the oil and and if we didn't have the ties with the Israelis we could probably stay out of it
sw2773B-ms98-a-0053 343.687000 348.575250 but i'm not for sure that we're we're not destined at least for
sw2773B-ms98-a-0054 348.575250 354.384375 the foreseeable future as long as we can keep our head our own head above water to be the the world's leader
sw2773B-ms98-a-0055 354.384375 366.134750 so i Bush is probably if if he can keep that correlation together especially the French and the British and the Germans and and and be sure that the Japanese can kick in some of their money
sw2773B-ms98-a-0056 366.134750 377.353625 um they may just have to i don't know what type pressure they can put on uh all the nations there too because_1 now that the war's over the societies have gone back just about to their own
sw2773B-ms98-a-0057 377.353625 389.497125 uh cold selves and uh i wouldn't have necessarily fought for the Kuwaitis they uh they're nobody likes them_1 in that part of the world uh but i[t's]- it's just such a
sw2773B-ms98-a-0058 389.497125 396.412250 such a volatile uh area i mean there's just no stability there period that's what's
sw2773B-ms98-a-0059 396.412250 405.763500 [silence]
sw2773B-ms98-a-0060 405.763500 406.907875 um-hum

sw2773B-ms98-a-0064 421.786375 428.119250 yeah i think you're right i it's not our uh role to make everybody like us
sw2773B-ms98-a-0065 428.119250 438.234125 uh yeah but it's just uh for those who who may have wanted to travel in that part of the world uh that are up in the age i am it's going
sw2773B-ms98-a-0066 438.234125 443.679375 eliminate that for awhile i just don't think it's going to be too dangerous to be any place in there
sw2773B-ms98-a-0067 443.679375 447.747250 [silence]
sw2773B-ms98-a-0068 447.747250 449.214375 oh did you
