sw2713B-ms98-a-0012 39.553750 46.873125 okay our topic for today is invasion of privacy so i got a good one
sw2713B-ms98-a-0013 46.873125 61.574125 when the phone rings and you've got a recording and this always happens like around five or six o'clock at night it rings and you get this recording and then it won't go away and any any of the type of solicitation that where they call all the time you know
sw2713B-ms98-a-0014 61.574125 75.087625 there are evenings especially Friday nights Thursday and Friday nights well we must get in the neighborhood of anywhere from three to six calls about that time of night more people call that's where you want to jerk the phone out of the wall you know your sitting down to eat and the phone rings and it's like
sw2713B-ms98-a-0015 75.087625 77.976625 i don't want anything thank you very much [laughter]
sw2713B-ms98-a-0016 77.976625 90.405625 [silence]

sw2713B-ms98-a-0019 94.740750 96.871875 um-hum oh yeah
sw2713B-ms98-a-0020 96.871875 98.335000 yeah
sw2713B-ms98-a-0021 98.335000 101.454000 tha[t's]- that's that's real irritating to me
sw2713B-ms98-a-0022 101.454000 111.251250 [silence]
sw2713B-ms98-a-0023 111.251250 112.336750 uh-huh
sw2713B-ms98-a-0024 112.336750 117.395500 [silence]
sw2713B-ms98-a-0025 117.395500 120.166375 they can leave their whole spiel on it
sw2713B-ms98-a-0026 120.166375 132.650750 [silence]
sw2713B-ms98-a-0027 132.650750 135.517500 um yeah that a
sw2713B-ms98-a-0028 135.517500 139.955000 [laughter] yeah that's that's a high irritant for me drives me crazy
sw2713B-ms98-a-0029 139.955000 145.503750 and it doesn't matter if you have an unlisted number or not because a lot of times these computer things
sw2713B-ms98-a-0030 145.503750 146.614000 will just
sw2713B-ms98-a-0031 146.614000 149.676750 make up numbers at random and just call them
sw2713B-ms98-a-0032 149.676750 151.197875 and so it really
sw2713B-ms98-a-0033 151.197875 154.378625 really doesn't make much difference as to whether or not
sw2713B-ms98-a-0034 154.378625 164.335125 you know you have a unlisted number or not and they pass around uh cards that have everybody's name on it like if you order something through a mail order catalog
sw2713B-ms98-a-0035 164.335125 175.468125 you know then you'll start getting a bunch of stuff in and a bunch of stuff and a bunch of stuff because they sell their customer list or they sell their catalog list of people to different companies
sw2713B-ms98-a-0036 175.468125 177.078500 and everything
sw2713B-ms98-a-0037 177.078500 188.001875 [silence]

sw2713B-ms98-a-0047 235.015625 242.918500 let's see i'm trying to think oh have you heard that that i'm trying to think of what company it was there was a company that was going to
sw2713B-ms98-a-0048 242.918500 246.244000 uh be giving out information
sw2713B-ms98-a-0049 246.244000 249.522625 about your financial status
sw2713B-ms98-a-0050 249.522625 251.271375 [laughter]
sw2713B-ms98-a-0051 251.271375 252.628125 [silence]
sw2713B-ms98-a-0052 252.628125 259.931875 well um i work in the computer science center and so we hear a lot about things that are that computers are capable of doing
sw2713B-ms98-a-0053 259.931875 263.214375 and uh this was a software program
sw2713B-ms98-a-0054 263.214375 271.343000 that a company was developing that was going to have X amount of million peoples financial history and information on it
sw2713B-ms98-a-0055 271.343000 278.418000 and they were going to sell it to companies who would up in turn solicit you for business et cetera et cetera
sw2713B-ms98-a-0056 278.418000 291.650250 and uh they finally uh stopped production of it because of all the hullabaloo it caused because it was such a big deal and i wouldn't have been too thrilled about it either i mean there was a lot of stuff going on about it
sw2713B-ms98-a-0057 291.650250 298.158125 [silence]
sw2713B-ms98-a-0058 298.158125 299.513125 okay

sw2713B-ms98-a-0072 370.507750 377.487375 um-hum well that's real interesting i know that a lot of times they ask for information that they don't really need on several things and 
sw2713B-ms98-a-0073 377.487375 389.906875 you know your credit app[lication]- and th[at]- all all they ever need you to do is give them permission to to pull a credit thing on on yourself and there it is that's all they really care about they just want that credit history to see if you're a liable person 
sw2713B-ms98-a-0074 389.906875 393.664625 if you're going to go ahead and pay your bills on time and things like that
sw2713B-ms98-a-0075 393.664625 433.426250 [silence]
sw2713B-ms98-a-0076 433.426250 448.216000 oh i know that there's several people i've talked to that really have a problem with it and i'm former military so you get kind of used to to going through stuff like that you know you don't pay any attention to it i mean once you sign over your soul to Uncle Sam [laughter-might] [laughter-as] you know you just kind of
sw2713B-ms98-a-0077 448.216000 450.111500 kind of blow it off but [laughter-so]
sw2713B-ms98-a-0078 450.111500 452.243750 [silence]
sw2713B-ms98-a-0079 452.243750 458.411125 so i think i think the people who've who've been down that route or have had it to deal with anything like that have learned you know 
sw2713B-ms98-a-0080 458.411125 470.262250 it's just one of those things you just do it and be done with it and don't worry about you know but i do know that there are several sites i didn't i wasn't aware that Austin was one of them but i think Johnson City was one
sw2713B-ms98-a-0081 470.262250 475.828500 yeah there's there's several of the cities that have been having real trouble with the issue
sw2713B-ms98-a-0082 475.828500 481.406250 and the but also on things that i'd heard too from a stockholders meeting was that
sw2713B-ms98-a-0083 481.406250 483.027125 there were people
sw2713B-ms98-a-0084 483.027125 494.729000 uh there were the same places where they had a real bad problem with people fighting it were also places they had a big bad problem with the drug usage too
sw2713B-ms98-a-0085 494.729000 502.284750 [silence]
sw2713B-ms98-a-0086 502.284750 503.670250 um-hum

sw2713B-ms98-a-0088 515.490000 516.961750 um-hum
sw2713B-ms98-a-0089 516.961750 522.953750 [silence]
sw2713B-ms98-a-0090 522.953750 524.911375 oh i don't think it's a
sw2713B-ms98-a-0091 524.911375 532.982750 necessary thing to publish it they just need to deal with it [vocalized-noise] and [vocalized-noise] on an individual basis i mean if they're going to do it just deal with it and be done with it 
sw2713B-ms98-a-0092 532.982750 541.334000 [silence]
sw2713B-ms98-a-0093 541.334000 542.685000 um-hum

sw2713B-ms98-a-0095 553.123625 554.826000 um or
sw2713B-ms98-a-0096 554.826000 556.197375 [silence]
sw2713B-ms98-a-0097 556.197375 567.232375 well i think it's a safety factor too because you know when people are inebriated whether it's alcohol or drugs or whatever they are very unsafe for the their coworkers you know it's like
sw2713B-ms98-a-0098 567.232375 580.593875 you know my father was a fireman and i can just imagine if you know [laughter] you know some guy being on drugs they go out there and and you know you've got somebody that's supposed to take care of you and they fall they fall out because of the drug issue you know 
sw2713B-ms98-a-0099 580.593875 590.655625 i mean you can forgive somebody because all of a sudden they maybe get hurt or whatever that that you can understand but the blatant use of drugs or anything like that
sw2713B-ms98-a-0100 590.655625 593.015750 will uh be a problem
sw2713B-ms98-a-0101 593.015750 596.580250 [silence]
sw2713B-ms98-a-0102 596.580250 598.362500 [laughter]
