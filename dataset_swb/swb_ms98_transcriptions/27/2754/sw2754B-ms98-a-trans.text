sw2754B-ms98-a-0005 4.167250 18.121000 well uh anyways i'm not exactly sure i i wasn't really uh paying attention as to what particular uh parts of capital punishment we're supposed to talk about but it was uh basically what's your views on whether you thought there was certain cases that should be used that sort of thing
sw2754B-ms98-a-0006 18.121000 20.380500 right and uh
sw2754B-ms98-a-0007 20.380500 24.805875 i don't know i've i've always thought that any uh crime that uh
sw2754B-ms98-a-0008 24.805875 31.172500 that uh intentionally where someone goes out and premeditatively takes another life
sw2754B-ms98-a-0009 31.172500 43.532125 would be the ones where i think that capital punishment would be necessary to keep that person from perhaps uh doing it again and even more so to get people on the outside who are professionals to realize that
sw2754B-ms98-a-0010 43.532125 47.966125 you know there's a a very steep penalty to uh be paid
sw2754B-ms98-a-0011 47.966125 49.704250 when that's done
sw2754B-ms98-a-0012 49.704250 51.077500 and uh
sw2754B-ms98-a-0013 51.077500 52.633125 [silence]
sw2754B-ms98-a-0014 52.633125 54.188750 yeah how do you feel about it

sw2754B-ms98-a-0024 105.256750 106.187375 uh-huh
sw2754B-ms98-a-0025 106.187375 110.025625 right if the if the [vocalized-noise] evidence wasn't overwhelming right
sw2754B-ms98-a-0026 110.025625 111.101625 uh-huh
sw2754B-ms98-a-0027 111.101625 111.956625 [silence]
sw2754B-ms98-a-0028 111.956625 116.914625 well i think that should be likewise decided by the jury you know because
sw2754B-ms98-a-0029 116.914625 127.313625 i don't know [noise] i think a jury would be less likely to just send a man to death just for any reason i don't know a judge might be a little more cold-blooded about it [noise] 
sw2754B-ms98-a-0030 127.313625 140.857250 [silence]
sw2754B-ms98-a-0031 140.857250 143.035875 [noise] yeah i don't think we

sw2754B-ms98-a-0033 148.304000 149.938750 no huh-uh
sw2754B-ms98-a-0034 149.938750 151.974375 no we don't
sw2754B-ms98-a-0035 151.974375 153.348500 yeah
sw2754B-ms98-a-0036 153.348500 155.418000 [silence]
sw2754B-ms98-a-0037 155.418000 156.411250 uh-huh
sw2754B-ms98-a-0038 156.411250 163.376750 oh yeah [laughter] they're always doing it in Florida Florida and Louisiana i think and uh some of the other southern states
sw2754B-ms98-a-0039 163.376750 164.396250 [silence]
sw2754B-ms98-a-0040 164.396250 176.301875 but they have such a crime problem because they have such a un[employment]- unemployment rate [noise] you get that unemployment way up so then people you know tend towards crime and then they [noise] they start stiffening the penalties
sw2754B-ms98-a-0041 176.301875 194.884250 [silence]
sw2754B-ms98-a-0042 194.884250 199.834000 well in Florida seems like uh two or three times a year it's constantly on the
sw2754B-ms98-a-0043 199.834000 204.130000 [noise]
sw2754B-ms98-a-0044 204.130000 204.623125 yeah
sw2754B-ms98-a-0045 204.623125 208.840250 [silence]
sw2754B-ms98-a-0046 208.840250 216.801625 no that's true course they have a requirement that uh that every single appeal must be permitted
sw2754B-ms98-a-0047 216.801625 220.936500 so of course the the attorneys take them through the whole chain
sw2754B-ms98-a-0048 220.936500 225.265000 you know even if the case is open and closed they go all the way up to the Supreme Court you know
sw2754B-ms98-a-0049 225.265000 225.949750 [silence]
sw2754B-ms98-a-0050 225.949750 234.133250 they almost always get thrown right back out again but they have to have every single appeal made open to them
sw2754B-ms98-a-0051 234.133250 237.196000 and you know it's sort of strange because it almost
sw2754B-ms98-a-0052 237.196000 238.466625 [silence]
sw2754B-ms98-a-0053 238.466625 244.548375 it almost seems like the attorneys are doing it for the money or something because i mean the guy knows that
sw2754B-ms98-a-0054 244.548375 245.801125 whether it's
sw2754B-ms98-a-0055 245.801125 251.947000 you know a a month or two or six years he's still going to get you know the chair when it comes [laughter-around]
sw2754B-ms98-a-0056 251.947000 253.013375 you know
sw2754B-ms98-a-0057 253.013375 254.685000 some of these guys are
sw2754B-ms98-a-0058 254.685000 256.370375 really uh
sw2754B-ms98-a-0059 256.370375 260.743500 you know violent Son of Sam killers and stuff like that you know
sw2754B-ms98-a-0060 260.743500 264.230375 i mean they everyone knows they're going get not going to get out
sw2754B-ms98-a-0061 264.230375 265.259375 [silence]
sw2754B-ms98-a-0062 265.259375 266.681000 yeah
sw2754B-ms98-a-0063 266.681000 268.171750 uh-huh
sw2754B-ms98-a-0064 268.171750 269.839500 [silence]
sw2754B-ms98-a-0065 269.839500 270.614375 uh-huh
sw2754B-ms98-a-0066 270.614375 292.786625 [silence]
sw2754B-ms98-a-0067 292.786625 304.054750 i think so uh a lot of the the the other violent crimes i don't really feel that strongly about although you know stiffer sentences and lessening the effects of parole i mean
sw2754B-ms98-a-0068 304.054750 314.958875 these guys are certainly not going to uh be they can't i mean they're getting into drugs and fights and all that stuff in prison i don't think the parole system is really helping that [laughter-much]
sw2754B-ms98-a-0069 314.958875 318.384000 reduce the violence in the prisons i think that's its only purpose
sw2754B-ms98-a-0070 318.384000 319.149625 is
sw2754B-ms98-a-0071 319.149625 326.576750 is you know to reduce uh the violence in the prisons so people behave themselves a little bit better if they think they're going to get off early
sw2754B-ms98-a-0072 326.576750 330.680000 off earlier but some of these guys just don't care you know
sw2754B-ms98-a-0073 330.680000 332.227375 and so uh
sw2754B-ms98-a-0074 332.227375 334.085250 [silence]
sw2754B-ms98-a-0075 334.085250 336.432875 yeah right uh-huh
sw2754B-ms98-a-0076 336.432875 339.476500 [silence]
sw2754B-ms98-a-0077 339.476500 341.610250 um that's possible i guess
sw2754B-ms98-a-0078 341.610250 350.341625 [silence]
sw2754B-ms98-a-0079 350.341625 352.666500 um so where do you live in Pennsylvania
sw2754B-ms98-a-0080 352.666500 357.489125 [silence]
sw2754B-ms98-a-0081 357.489125 360.575875 oh okay [noise] i don't think i really know that
sw2754B-ms98-a-0082 360.575875 361.957500 [silence]
sw2754B-ms98-a-0083 361.957500 372.431125 because uh you know that all depends too on where you are at that's uh sort of interesting to get opinions as to where different parts of the country are because_1 the more grass root country uh parts of the country tend to
sw2754B-ms98-a-0084 372.431125 382.768375 to support capital punishment where the places that are you know less in contact with crime you know the the more more urban i mean less
sw2754B-ms98-a-0085 382.768375 392.152375 [silence]
sw2754B-ms98-a-0086 392.152375 393.167500 uh-huh

sw2754B-ms98-a-0094 418.856125 420.128000 [silence]
sw2754B-ms98-a-0095 420.128000 423.071250 very old uh historical place there
sw2754B-ms98-a-0096 423.071250 425.811250 Sharon Pennsylvania's up there
sw2754B-ms98-a-0097 425.811250 427.247500 yeah
sw2754B-ms98-a-0098 427.247500 428.589000 [silence]

sw2754B-ms98-a-0101 445.748875 448.052875 in that case maybe you know
sw2754B-ms98-a-0102 448.052875 465.628125 [silence]
sw2754B-ms98-a-0103 465.628125 466.972000 right
sw2754B-ms98-a-0104 466.972000 475.003625 that's true yeah well it it you know you get certain circumstances where you hear about these people that have you know stolen kids and
sw2754B-ms98-a-0105 475.003625 478.636125 you know done terrible things to them and killed them and you know that sort of thing
sw2754B-ms98-a-0106 478.636125 485.122250 you just like i don't want that person sharing the Earth with me you know i mean that is just terrible
sw2754B-ms98-a-0107 485.122250 492.524750 and uh you know we had a case like that here and on the other hand you know people are saying that because the
sw2754B-ms98-a-0108 492.524750 503.466875 he knows because the the criminals know that the uh penalties can be very severe they uh there's less criminals that are you know turning themselves in or you know
sw2754B-ms98-a-0109 503.466875 505.688875 pleading or whatever
sw2754B-ms98-a-0110 505.688875 513.300000 because they know that the judge you know if they find them guilty is you know has the the opportunity to sentence them you know for for the death sentence
sw2754B-ms98-a-0111 513.300000 516.744125 [silence]
sw2754B-ms98-a-0112 516.744125 528.978875 yeah well i'm just saying that that that's what the the client lawyers are saying they're saying that you know you know more of my clients would have pleaded guilty if they would have gotten a light sentence instead of possibly having to
sw2754B-ms98-a-0113 528.978875 535.948500 to to get a death sentence because you can't plea bargain what the sentence is going to be you can plea bargain what you're guilty of but
sw2754B-ms98-a-0114 535.948500 537.146125 you know
sw2754B-ms98-a-0115 537.146125 539.480000 but not how they're going to sentence it
sw2754B-ms98-a-0116 539.480000 545.171125 [silence]
sw2754B-ms98-a-0117 545.171125 546.883625 right uh-huh

sw2754B-ms98-a-0119 548.354000 549.926375 yeah right
sw2754B-ms98-a-0120 549.926375 551.933000 [silence]
sw2754B-ms98-a-0121 551.933000 557.452250 uh-huh i was just saying that way what they're saying is that they can't get people to turn themselves in then
sw2754B-ms98-a-0122 557.452250 565.287250 and so we have to go through a trial then to prove the person's guilty and perhaps we can and perhaps we can't and so the guy might get off
sw2754B-ms98-a-0123 565.287250 567.436125 [laughter] and uh
sw2754B-ms98-a-0124 567.436125 573.443250 although usually the guys that are turning themselves in are are guys that are you know going to get caught anyways but
sw2754B-ms98-a-0125 573.443250 577.419750 there's always a few of those people that are you know lost their head or whatever
sw2754B-ms98-a-0126 577.419750 578.715625 [silence]
sw2754B-ms98-a-0127 578.715625 580.062250 anyways
sw2754B-ms98-a-0128 580.062250 581.385750 but uh
sw2754B-ms98-a-0129 581.385750 589.709250 yeah we just had a terrible case in Virginia where some girl disappeared and and the guy like i said he just uh
sw2754B-ms98-a-0130 589.709250 598.768000 said that he took her but he won't admit that she died or whatever and he won't say where the body is because he knows the penalty's very s[evere]- s[evere]- you know mandatory life sentences for murder
