sw2727A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.704875 [noise]
sw2727A-ms98-a-0002 0.704875 5.991000 so um you said you don't have kids but um you're interested in the topic
sw2727A-ms98-a-0003 5.991000 29.163125 [silence]
sw2727A-ms98-a-0004 29.163125 30.477125 uh-huh
sw2727A-ms98-a-0005 30.477125 35.960000 [silence]
sw2727A-ms98-a-0006 35.960000 37.497375 right
sw2727A-ms98-a-0007 37.497375 44.840000 yes yes i have one son who's now uh eighteen and he's a sophomore in college
sw2727A-ms98-a-0008 44.840000 55.181125 and it it does but i was very lucky in that i was um teaching at a university and so basically and lived within walking distance
sw2727A-ms98-a-0009 55.181125 62.514125 so i was able when he was little just to um leave him with a neighbor in uh one of these carry cots
sw2727A-ms98-a-0010 62.514125 65.995125 and then go up and teach a class and come back
sw2727A-ms98-a-0011 65.995125 74.282000 because i could do my work at home and my my students who were working on their master's degrees and stuff would come to my house and i would meet with them there
sw2727A-ms98-a-0012 74.282000 85.477500 so it was really ideal and then later on um when he was gee maybe two and three i actually took him then i changed to a different school but it was still within walking distance
sw2727A-ms98-a-0013 85.477500 90.652375 and um he spent a lot of time in my office because_1 i was uh department chairman
sw2727A-ms98-a-0014 90.652375 97.987500 and um you know really didn't interfere because all his life he had sort of been used to there were quiet [laughter-times] 
sw2727A-ms98-a-0015 97.987500 100.710250 [noise] and so and that worked out great
sw2727A-ms98-a-0016 100.710250 105.100000 [silence]
sw2727A-ms98-a-0017 105.100000 106.256000 yes
sw2727A-ms98-a-0018 106.256000 107.604750 [silence]
sw2727A-ms98-a-0019 107.604750 110.857000 yes he's commuting it's um about
sw2727A-ms98-a-0020 110.857000 121.703625 gee he commutes forty five minutes a each way but he has to allow an hour and a half going to school because it's too too chancy for him to miss classes
sw2727A-ms98-a-0021 121.703625 129.882625 and so actually we don't i mean we still spend a lot of time together in the sense that we are always together for dinner and and
sw2727A-ms98-a-0022 129.882625 133.722875 um then you know he's in the house studying in the evening
sw2727A-ms98-a-0023 133.722875 138.581125 and he also works and so um he usually calls me
sw2727A-ms98-a-0024 138.581125 149.717125 at when he gets home from school at noon i mean not not checking in but more gee you know missed you you know what with this is what's new type of thing and i think we have a very good relationship from that standpoint but i think it's
sw2727A-ms98-a-0025 149.717125 155.711250 unusual and i think part of it is that that we were abroad for a good part of the [laughter-time]
sw2727A-ms98-a-0026 155.711250 159.045375 until till um six years ago
sw2727A-ms98-a-0027 159.045375 160.319000 [silence]
sw2727A-ms98-a-0028 160.319000 162.822250 well i was actually in the Middle East
sw2727A-ms98-a-0029 162.822250 164.675500 so
sw2727A-ms98-a-0030 164.675500 165.925750 yeah
sw2727A-ms98-a-0031 165.925750 168.000000 [silence]
sw2727A-ms98-a-0032 168.000000 171.579125 bilingual yes yeah actually um
sw2727A-ms98-a-0033 171.579125 179.574875 he he was more in a sense raised trilingual in that i spoke Spanish to him when he was a baby
sw2727A-ms98-a-0034 179.574875 184.116000 and then but he always answered in Arabic because_1 he heard more Arabic than Spanish
sw2727A-ms98-a-0035 184.116000 188.742250 and then when we first came to visit my mother he picked up English when he was two and a half
sw2727A-ms98-a-0036 188.742250 193.646625 and he had heard me talk English on the phone but you know he hadn't he really didn't use it
sw2727A-ms98-a-0037 193.646625 194.677125 [silence]
sw2727A-ms98-a-0038 194.677125 195.961250 so

sw2727A-ms98-a-0059 247.364125 255.929625 yeah but see there's a big big issue there because my my family spoke German at home so that we couldn't understand
sw2727A-ms98-a-0060 255.929625 262.157000 and and my um nieces and nephews are not learning their mother's language
sw2727A-ms98-a-0061 262.157000 271.271125 so that i think this is a a tendency in the States is because it's a melting pot so i think my son had the advantage of we were actually living outside the country
sw2727A-ms98-a-0062 271.271125 274.088375 so there was a reason for him to learn it
sw2727A-ms98-a-0063 274.088375 275.617625 [silence]
sw2727A-ms98-a-0064 275.617625 277.931875 yeah it's really hard
sw2727A-ms98-a-0065 277.931875 290.303875 [silence]
sw2727A-ms98-a-0066 290.303875 296.660000 well i'm not so sure that it's the the academics as much as spending time with him
sw2727A-ms98-a-0067 296.660000 304.927375 and i've been concerned in the States since i've been back with the number particularly in the Washington area where i live now
sw2727A-ms98-a-0068 304.927375 313.176375 um [vocalized-noise] with a seeing how many kids come home to empty houses and like in our court we live in our townhouse court
sw2727A-ms98-a-0069 313.176375 316.896625 and there's seven year olds that come home and they're locked out
sw2727A-ms98-a-0070 316.896625 321.195625 and you know some of the neighbors sort of feel sorr[y]- sorry for them_1 an[d]- and
sw2727A-ms98-a-0071 321.195625 330.424500 you know would be very responsible if something happened but the parents aren't willing to to pay that person to sort of be in charge and and i think this is
sw2727A-ms98-a-0072 330.424500 337.742500 i you know i've just seen so much of it here in this country that you wouldn't see in in certainly not in the Arab culture i mean
sw2727A-ms98-a-0073 337.742500 341.634000 [laughter] peo[ple]- people are more important than things so
sw2727A-ms98-a-0074 341.634000 346.523250 [silence]
sw2727A-ms98-a-0075 346.523250 355.184500 he's a terror well he's a terror he just you know climbs on cars walks around the court threatening people with sticks
sw2727A-ms98-a-0076 355.184500 356.637000 yeah it

sw2727A-ms98-a-0100 435.001375 440.487500 right actually we traveled extensively because i was doing archeology and so
sw2727A-ms98-a-0101 440.487500 446.688875 you know he was always able to come with me on all my travels because a lot of the places i went by car of course
sw2727A-ms98-a-0102 446.688875 456.522500 and i mean you know i was living in the middle of it and i took every advantage and and you know he doesn't dislike travel now he might not like it
sw2727A-ms98-a-0103 456.522500 463.757625 uh you know he might not feel compelled to travel because he has seen a lot but he's very comfortable traveling
sw2727A-ms98-a-0104 463.757625 465.499875 and so
sw2727A-ms98-a-0105 465.499875 468.799250 [silence]
sw2727A-ms98-a-0106 468.799250 471.476375 that's right that's right

sw2727A-ms98-a-0108 474.082250 480.400875 right [laughter-you] [laughter-know] [laughter-that] that remains to be seen but yes i think so i think so
sw2727A-ms98-a-0109 480.400875 481.834375 so
sw2727A-ms98-a-0110 481.834375 482.898625 [silence]
sw2727A-ms98-a-0111 482.898625 484.252625 no [noise]
sw2727A-ms98-a-0112 484.252625 489.625500 no and and and i find that interesting because he's been two years ahead in the schools here
sw2727A-ms98-a-0113 489.625500 498.411250 and so he always you know was treated like little brother when the band needed transportation they'd say oh he can't drive so
sw2727A-ms98-a-0114 498.411250 503.040000 you know when he's a senior he can drive some of the the younger kids around type of thing 
sw2727A-ms98-a-0115 503.040000 507.755625 and he di[dn't]- he didn't get his li[cense]- i mean he was just sixteen when he graduated from high school so
sw2727A-ms98-a-0116 507.755625 513.773375 you know he he has friends but he doesn't have any you know he hasn't really gotten into the social thing
sw2727A-ms98-a-0117 513.773375 521.318750 and [noise] he's i think that's all right he's going to it looks like finish his degree first before he gets too involved
sw2727A-ms98-a-0118 521.318750 522.907000 yeah
sw2727A-ms98-a-0119 522.907000 532.021625 [silence]

sw2727A-ms98-a-0126 549.694625 554.343625 but you don't have to keep up i mean kids appreciate it more if you don't
sw2727A-ms98-a-0127 554.343625 560.256875 i think if if things are special and are for them they see that their kids are being bought
sw2727A-ms98-a-0128 560.256875 563.006500 that their friends are being bought by their parents
sw2727A-ms98-a-0129 563.006500 566.087375 [silence]

sw2727A-ms98-a-0133 572.522125 577.161875 i mean that's my feeling i think you know from what i see a lot of people just
sw2727A-ms98-a-0134 577.161875 583.060000 it's a token you know you don't have me so you have all these material things
