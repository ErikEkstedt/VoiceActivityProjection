sw2718A-ms98-a-0025 68.377750 75.027000 so uh like if you go to uh K Wal-Mart or something you always pay in cash or with a check
sw2718A-ms98-a-0026 75.027000 76.458000 cash

sw2718A-ms98-a-0031 85.981500 87.173750 [silence]
sw2718A-ms98-a-0032 87.173750 91.982125 me i have a Discover card and i use that
sw2718A-ms98-a-0033 91.982125 93.147625 [silence]
sw2718A-ms98-a-0034 93.147625 104.675750 when when gas prices are the same whether you use cash or credit i usually use my Discover card and i can let my money sit in the bank for an extra
sw2718A-ms98-a-0035 104.675750 118.315875 because_1 they pay in our credit union pays at the end of the month on your balance so i will let it sit and then draw interest from that and then i'll pay my credit cards off in full every month
sw2718A-ms98-a-0036 118.315875 124.724750 so you know i have no finance charges as long as i pay off exactly on time which i do
sw2718A-ms98-a-0037 124.724750 137.857375 and also Discover card gives you a little bit of money back it's not much but you know five or six bucks uh instead of writing a check for a large purchase if i'm disciplined enough i can
sw2718A-ms98-a-0038 137.857375 146.211000 uh like we[ll]- uh like buying a suit if i spend like three hundred bucks you know i'll get some of that back through the
sw2718A-ms98-a-0039 146.211000 155.178125 cash back program and also at the end of the month you know i'll get my interest on that three hundred bucks that was sitting in my checking account that would be gone had i written a check
sw2718A-ms98-a-0040 155.178125 165.685125 and i do that sometimes but like when we go to the like uh i'd say it's about fifty fifty writing a check or using the Discover card
sw2718A-ms98-a-0041 165.685125 180.557750 it just i don't know for some reason it just depe[nd]- if it's something small i don't want to write a uh use my credit card but that's the only one i have and and sometimes we order things through the mail like books and uh 
sw2718A-ms98-a-0042 180.557750 188.287375 which is i just if they have a toll free number i'll call it up and you know charge it to my credit card a[s]- as long as
sw2718A-ms98-a-0043 188.287375 195.603250 you know i'd make myself pay on time every time so there's no finance charge and 
sw2718A-ms98-a-0044 195.603250 209.611125 it's really you know like you said some people go off half wild and spend uh they think because they've got a thousand dollar limit then you know they've got to get that limit every month or something and uh they end up paying
sw2718A-ms98-a-0045 209.611125 223.332750 finance charges and they just and then they'll pay the minimum balance every month and then end up they may have got something on sale but all the interest you know they end up paying more than what they would have had they just paid cash for it
sw2718A-ms98-a-0046 223.332750 242.043000 [silence]

sw2718A-ms98-a-0116 504.984000 519.467625 yeah it seems a lot more places are taking it now which when i first got it it was a problem with it i- i said i don't want to use the credit card and i just carried it with me like you said for identification and sometimes when i would take it go on a trip you know it
sw2718A-ms98-a-0117 519.467625 531.184750 it was good to have a credit card because_1 like if my car breaks down or something a [vocalized-noise] lot of states don't because i travel from Indiana to Texas and a lot of states won't take out of state checks like you know just some gas station out of the way 
sw2718A-ms98-a-0118 531.184750 539.757500 they want cash or a major card so i went ahead and got that and there's no fee no service fee for it
sw2718A-ms98-a-0119 539.757500 550.093750 plus they play pay you cash back at the end of the i think i earned probably eight or nine bucks last year which isn't very much but i'd just started to use it and
sw2718A-ms98-a-0120 550.093750 561.697500 and like i- i had some major purchases i just was dumb and forgot to put on there like uh i wrote a check for my wife's wedding ring which was a lot of money and if i would have put it on the Discover card
sw2718A-ms98-a-0121 561.697500 571.050875 the money you know could have sat in the savings account or the checking account for an extra month and it also would have paid me probably you know eight or nine bucks back
sw2718A-ms98-a-0122 571.050875 580.760875 on uh the end of the year thing so i messed that up so i you know i'm still not in it's not a good habit to use it but fortunately i'm not uh
sw2718A-ms98-a-0123 580.760875 590.767875 like some people not a spendthrift and i really have to think about my purchases and i know if i have money in the checking account to cover it
sw2718A-ms98-a-0124 590.767875 596.363875 then i i'll use the Discover card you know to get a little more interest
sw2718A-ms98-a-0125 596.363875 598.119875 but uh
sw2718A-ms98-a-0126 598.119875 600.049250 yeah i i'm just very [vocalized-noise]
