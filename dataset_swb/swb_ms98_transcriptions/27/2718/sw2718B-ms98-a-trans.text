sw2718B-ms98-a-0007 24.636125 30.678250 i've used them but never to the extent of getting in debt like uh some people do
sw2718B-ms98-a-0008 30.678250 34.295750 it's just that since my money is tight right now
sw2718B-ms98-a-0009 34.295750 36.871875 i don't even give myself a tempting
sw2718B-ms98-a-0010 36.871875 38.925250 because_1 i've gotten them all paid off

sw2718B-ms98-a-0016 51.152875 52.829000 because_1 i won't use it period
sw2718B-ms98-a-0017 52.829000 54.625875 [silence]
sw2718B-ms98-a-0018 54.625875 55.476625 if
sw2718B-ms98-a-0019 55.476625 57.066875 [silence]

sw2718B-ms98-a-0022 60.739125 62.388875 but otherwise huh-uh
sw2718B-ms98-a-0023 62.388875 64.770750 [silence]
sw2718B-ms98-a-0024 64.770750 66.132500 never
sw2718B-ms98-a-0025 66.132500 67.528875 never
sw2718B-ms98-a-0026 67.528875 74.353875 [silence]
sw2718B-ms98-a-0027 74.353875 76.693000 um-hum ca[sh]- check
sw2718B-ms98-a-0028 76.693000 79.468875 very seldom do i even use cash
sw2718B-ms98-a-0029 79.468875 84.415750 [silence]
sw2718B-ms98-a-0030 84.415750 85.877625 um-hum
sw2718B-ms98-a-0031 85.877625 87.412875 how about_1 you
sw2718B-ms98-a-0032 87.412875 223.609250 [silence]
sw2718B-ms98-a-0033 223.609250 233.567250 see that's exactly i didn't get in debt but what i did was one year oh i can't remember when five six must be eight nine years ago
sw2718B-ms98-a-0034 233.567250 241.190750 when i paid my taxes i realized that i had ran up so much on my credit card that i was paying interest that was
sw2718B-ms98-a-0035 241.190750 245.280625 ridiculous i mean sure it was the tax write-off but
sw2718B-ms98-a-0036 245.280625 246.900750 there was no sense to it
sw2718B-ms98-a-0037 246.900750 253.354625 i mean there was no sense at all to it i was paying more interest on that card than the card was worth as far as i could tell
sw2718B-ms98-a-0038 253.354625 261.493000 so at that point there we just stepped right on you know just saving all the way in and i'll turn around like on my car i'll borrow
sw2718B-ms98-a-0039 261.493000 266.786000 against my insurance which i pay five percent interest
sw2718B-ms98-a-0040 266.786000 268.787750 and buy my car that way
sw2718B-ms98-a-0041 268.787750 270.238625 and that works
sw2718B-ms98-a-0042 270.238625 272.003125 [silence]
sw2718B-ms98-a-0043 272.003125 278.509500 so i don't have to worry about it but i use uh override at uh Texin Credit Union
sw2718B-ms98-a-0044 278.509500 283.125500 so that i don't have to keep too much i keep enough balance in my checking account so i don't have to pay
sw2718B-ms98-a-0045 283.125500 284.897375 you know a service charge
sw2718B-ms98-a-0046 284.897375 285.965875 [silence]
sw2718B-ms98-a-0047 285.965875 287.035750 and then i yeah
sw2718B-ms98-a-0048 287.035750 288.328875 [silence]
sw2718B-ms98-a-0049 288.328875 292.042750 if i write a check real large it'll go ahead and pull it out of my savings account
sw2718B-ms98-a-0050 292.042750 293.282625 [silence]
sw2718B-ms98-a-0051 293.282625 297.511875 so i don't have to you know worry about it one way of the other and i just keep that minimum balance in there
sw2718B-ms98-a-0052 297.511875 298.761750 [silence]
sw2718B-ms98-a-0053 298.761750 304.068000 so it just you know and i pretty much budget that way all the way around but as i said my money's tight
sw2718B-ms98-a-0054 304.068000 305.398250 right now
sw2718B-ms98-a-0055 305.398250 306.524250 [silence]
sw2718B-ms98-a-0056 306.524250 307.651625 yeah
sw2718B-ms98-a-0057 307.651625 309.333875 there's no charge for it
sw2718B-ms98-a-0058 309.333875 310.595375 [silence]
sw2718B-ms98-a-0059 310.595375 316.595125 so i do it that way but i do as i said i keep the credit card in my purse for identification
sw2718B-ms98-a-0060 316.595125 319.042625 when somebody wants identification one way or the other
sw2718B-ms98-a-0061 319.042625 320.141875 [silence]
sw2718B-ms98-a-0062 320.141875 326.643875 but usually i won't put anything on that card unless it's something i really unbelievably need otherwise i better have it somewhere else
sw2718B-ms98-a-0063 326.643875 331.164000 because_1 i'm like you i'm not going to have a balance on that thing because_1 it's too easy
sw2718B-ms98-a-0064 331.164000 340.025125 i know too many people that pay off that card well i've got this credit card well maybe i'd better use that one or something like that and i'm saying huh-uh not me
sw2718B-ms98-a-0065 340.025125 358.022625 [silence]
sw2718B-ms98-a-0066 358.022625 362.835375 well it's like um the little piece of plastic for uh
sw2718B-ms98-a-0067 362.835375 368.036250 to get your money out or the credit union all you have to do is put it in the machine one way or the other
sw2718B-ms98-a-0068 368.036250 374.337500 and like i'll run down there like you know for vacation and things like that and i'll leave it in there in savings account till the last day
sw2718B-ms98-a-0069 374.337500 377.296000 and then i'll put the card in and pull it out what i want
sw2718B-ms98-a-0070 377.296000 380.684250 but i'll pull it out of savings because i don't keep any balance in the checking
sw2718B-ms98-a-0071 380.684250 387.260500 but that's still that's easy enough as it is but i wouldn't use the machine to pay fifty cents or a dollar for it
sw2718B-ms98-a-0072 387.260500 389.555250 i won't even go that far
sw2718B-ms98-a-0073 389.555250 423.077875 [silence]
sw2718B-ms98-a-0074 423.077875 424.106000 um
sw2718B-ms98-a-0075 424.106000 425.747625 [silence]
sw2718B-ms98-a-0076 425.747625 427.827625 but i'm like you if there's something
sw2718B-ms98-a-0077 427.827625 429.680875 really that i wanted
sw2718B-ms98-a-0078 429.680875 434.887500 i'll write to them_1 before i'll put the credit card call in though i won't put it on the card unless i really
sw2718B-ms98-a-0079 434.887500 437.799000 i'll take write them_1 le[tter]- uh check for it
sw2718B-ms98-a-0080 437.799000 440.544500 because it wastes too much time
sw2718B-ms98-a-0081 440.544500 445.357875 on the credit card and i'm kind of i'm leery about things going on my card because_1 i've had
sw2718B-ms98-a-0082 445.357875 450.797375 you know had to go back and return something and it took so long to get it off and that was years ago
sw2718B-ms98-a-0083 450.797375 453.712375 so i'm having real good luck with a credit card
sw2718B-ms98-a-0084 453.712375 457.460375 i mean it came off there's no problem but it just takes too much
sw2718B-ms98-a-0085 457.460375 458.690000 scares me
sw2718B-ms98-a-0086 458.690000 459.830000 [silence]
sw2718B-ms98-a-0087 459.830000 463.641375 and like Tom Thumb's got uh credit card now they used for groceries
sw2718B-ms98-a-0088 463.641375 464.723375 [silence]
sw2718B-ms98-a-0089 464.723375 466.568250 yeah over here in in Plano
sw2718B-ms98-a-0090 466.568250 468.687625 [silence]
sw2718B-ms98-a-0091 468.687625 469.348375 uh-huh
sw2718B-ms98-a-0092 469.348375 471.526375 and you can charge your groceries on it
sw2718B-ms98-a-0093 471.526375 478.165375 and uh you can either charge your groceries on it you have a choice or you can write a check and they okayed it that way
sw2718B-ms98-a-0094 478.165375 487.345000 so you don't have to keep going and get it you know credit check and things like that and they'll give you an extra twenty five dollars no charge or anything else like that but i won't even put that on the groceries
sw2718B-ms98-a-0095 487.345000 489.016750 [silence]
sw2718B-ms98-a-0096 489.016750 495.066000 because hey what happens if the clerk marks in an extra number or something like that and i don't check it
sw2718B-ms98-a-0097 495.066000 501.181500 no thank you i don't want anything going on my card you know in my checking account unless it's i know about it
sw2718B-ms98-a-0098 501.181500 505.189000 but do you like Discover card i hadn't heard too much about it
