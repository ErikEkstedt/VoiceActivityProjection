sw2768B-ms98-a-0022 121.857250 127.737375 just not doing anymore you know than they had to do and um just kind of letting everybody live
sw2768B-ms98-a-0023 127.737375 129.673875 [laughter] in a not very good environment
sw2768B-ms98-a-0024 129.673875 137.502750 but this new company came in and they like i said they remodeled the place and it smells nice when you walk in and it looks nice and
sw2768B-ms98-a-0025 137.502750 149.430625 they got like several new color TV's for the people and and redid the dining room where they made it you know a lot more interesting place for them to be they made a little patio area where they can go outside and
sw2768B-ms98-a-0026 149.430625 154.087375 yeah just you know just small things that make it seem a lot more

sw2768B-ms98-a-0049 205.547375 212.951500 well they uh this this place that we visit it's really neat they have everyday they have schedules of groups that come in and
sw2768B-ms98-a-0050 212.951500 224.855375 they will do bingo our group does a church service once a month and and then other servi[ce]- other groups come in and do the services you know other Sundays so that they have at least one service every Sunday and
sw2768B-ms98-a-0051 224.855375 229.327125 so there are a lot of things there are places that have a lot of things for them to do
sw2768B-ms98-a-0052 229.327125 232.379625 but you really do have to kind of seek it out you know and
sw2768B-ms98-a-0053 232.379625 236.581750 and make sure that it's not a place like this one was [laughter]
sw2768B-ms98-a-0054 236.581750 237.720875 [silence]
sw2768B-ms98-a-0055 237.720875 246.854750 yeah yeah yeah it is it's real nice and um i know our church does it and there are a lot of other churches and they are just like civic organizations that do
sw2768B-ms98-a-0056 246.854750 257.606875 and uh i have other friends it's kinds of neat they take um animals over and let the people pet them like they also have a dog that maybe needs a home and they will wash it all up and
sw2768B-ms98-a-0057 257.606875 264.584125 make sure it's a friendly animal you know and take it in and let just let the old elderly people pet the dogs

sw2768B-ms98-a-0062 271.631375 277.514000 yeah yeah i thought that was a real unusual thing for someone to do so
sw2768B-ms98-a-0063 277.514000 283.027375 yeah it there's a lot that can be done it's just a matter of people not being lazy
sw2768B-ms98-a-0064 283.027375 290.504625 and you know doing the best they can but again i don't know what i'd do if it was my own mother or grandmother you know uh that would be

sw2768B-ms98-a-0081 340.381750 343.915125 um many of them of course their minds are not good
sw2768B-ms98-a-0082 343.915125 348.479500 and so a lot of them have told me exactly the same story you know every time i visit them
sw2768B-ms98-a-0083 348.479500 356.547125 they'll tell me they'll reminisce about childhood and tell me something that they did and then the next time i go it's the same thing you know but
sw2768B-ms98-a-0084 356.547125 361.571250 just somebody to listen to them uh just seems to really make them_1 feel good
sw2768B-ms98-a-0085 361.571250 375.132750 right i'll tell you the people i feel the the sorriest for there's a [vocalized-noise] a a guy at this particular one i go to that i think that he's really an intelligent person but he has cerebral palsy so bad that he just cannot communicate
sw2768B-ms98-a-0086 375.132750 384.561750 and um he's blind and he's um [noise] has seizures you know i mean he's just he's like in a world of his own and yet he wants so much to be around people
sw2768B-ms98-a-0087 384.561750 394.109500 and if you come over to him if he can touch your hand he'll grab it and kiss it and oh he's always got a smile i mean he really tries to
sw2768B-ms98-a-0088 394.109500 401.117750 to brighten up your life oh it's just amazing um but he can't say anything he can just kind of make noises you know

sw2768B-ms98-a-0119 459.811875 466.563375 but the one of the neatest things i think though is we always take our kids i have a three year old and a six year old and they um
sw2768B-ms98-a-0120 466.563375 470.481000 have gotten comfortable being around these people because they've always gone with us
sw2768B-ms98-a-0121 470.481000 472.586375 and the people love them and
sw2768B-ms98-a-0122 472.586375 479.085750 they want the children you know to hug them or hold their hand and so far my kids will do it just real easily
sw2768B-ms98-a-0123 479.085750 486.794875 and i think it's because they've gone since they were real little and they've never been afraid but um that's something to me children
sw2768B-ms98-a-0124 486.794875 492.800000 you know need to people need to take groups of children [laughter] because the kids just brighten up their lives they
sw2768B-ms98-a-0125 492.800000 500.373625 as we walk through the the lobby they'll all say bring her here i want to see her [laughter] you know i want to hold her and
