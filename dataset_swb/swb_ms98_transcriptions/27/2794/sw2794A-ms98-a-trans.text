sw2794A-ms98-a-0025 82.061500 93.603750 oh that's interesting yeah that's probably true i mean well we also we'd be spending less because all the money that that normally goes to support those people aren't working it's back in the system
sw2794A-ms98-a-0026 93.603750 102.959750 so you're right that's a real neat idea well what but i mean what can you know at at some point what can you do to sort of raise rev[enue]- i mean to raise jobs i wonder

sw2794A-ms98-a-0086 404.963000 407.852875 right it does seem only fair i mean why not
