sw2708A-ms98-a-0024 66.653750 74.494375 you know there's there's not enough room in these prisons and that and that uh to continue funding it they think they need to
sw2708A-ms98-a-0025 74.494375 78.799125 maybe have uh you know private you know business
sw2708A-ms98-a-0026 78.799125 81.592000 private enterprise come in so

sw2708A-ms98-a-0038 172.326125 177.398500 all those European countries they pay all the way through college and stuff like that
sw2708A-ms98-a-0039 177.398500 178.585875 [silence]

sw2708A-ms98-a-0042 185.492000 196.927250 no yeah i know what you are saying but i'm just saying that even the differences uh is that you know some countries pay for students to go to through college and etcetera but here
sw2708A-ms98-a-0043 196.927250 199.540625 it you know it's just up to high school
sw2708A-ms98-a-0044 199.540625 218.524625 [silence]

sw2708A-ms98-a-0051 241.685125 244.816750 i think the pro[gram]- you know that's one reason uh
sw2708A-ms98-a-0052 244.816750 250.934500 you know we do have the education is that what it takes for these companies to bring somebody on board uh
sw2708A-ms98-a-0053 250.934500 253.999125 they're not willing to you know to put that you know
sw2708A-ms98-a-0054 253.999125 257.908125 the training for only a certain amount so
sw2708A-ms98-a-0055 257.908125 260.663500 um it's you know
sw2708A-ms98-a-0056 260.663500 263.178625 as far as the technical side
sw2708A-ms98-a-0057 263.178625 264.228625 [silence]
sw2708A-ms98-a-0058 264.228625 265.533500 but uh
sw2708A-ms98-a-0059 265.533500 269.048500 even like one one of the biggest things now is like
sw2708A-ms98-a-0060 269.048500 276.438750 paralegals and stuff i mean they they're trying to get more people into that field but they can't just bring somebody in
sw2708A-ms98-a-0061 276.438750 283.614750 without even having gone to you know school in that area before they can work
sw2708A-ms98-a-0062 283.614750 286.480125 you know for a lawyer as a paralegal
sw2708A-ms98-a-0063 286.480125 293.980625 [silence]
sw2708A-ms98-a-0064 293.980625 307.885375 um-hum well yeah i i'm well ye[ah]- i you know i'm assuming that it can be done uh my perspective is that you know i've been with a couple of big companies now and it's like they'd are unwilling to put the time in
sw2708A-ms98-a-0065 307.885375 311.447625 you know they want somebody you know when they then when they bring them off
sw2708A-ms98-a-0066 311.447625 318.288500 bring them in that they have something you know a certain amount to contribute obviously there's uh uh you know there's a lot to learn
sw2708A-ms98-a-0067 318.288500 320.606000 uh after that but
sw2708A-ms98-a-0068 320.606000 325.108250 but uh that's true i'm i'm sure there's a lot of um
sw2708A-ms98-a-0069 325.108250 334.197250 you know businesses are small you know small businesses that could uh let me change my channel i've got a cordless phone let me see if that clears this up
sw2708A-ms98-a-0070 334.197250 335.910750 [noise]
sw2708A-ms98-a-0071 335.910750 337.292500 is that better
sw2708A-ms98-a-0072 337.292500 338.551500 okay
sw2708A-ms98-a-0073 338.551500 340.126875 an[d]-
sw2708A-ms98-a-0074 340.126875 348.462750 yeah it was a cordless phone and all of a sudden we had a bad uh frequency there or something so we had some interference so i changed that
sw2708A-ms98-a-0075 348.462750 350.809625 [silence]
sw2708A-ms98-a-0076 350.809625 353.206750 anyway so um
sw2708A-ms98-a-0077 353.206750 354.263625 [silence]
sw2708A-ms98-a-0078 354.263625 356.619500 but uh you know i think uh
sw2708A-ms98-a-0079 356.619500 371.504375 they maybe they need to uh help promote that more give incentives like uh if they do bring somebody on they will pay some of their costs or give tax breaks or whatever it is you know for them to train people
sw2708A-ms98-a-0080 371.504375 376.864625 you know stuff like that programs like that you know i don't know you know what kind of options they've got
sw2708A-ms98-a-0081 376.864625 398.793375 [silence]
sw2708A-ms98-a-0082 398.793375 400.143250 uh-huh

sw2708A-ms98-a-0084 406.620125 407.680000 um-hum
sw2708A-ms98-a-0085 407.680000 417.862000 [silence]
sw2708A-ms98-a-0086 417.862000 421.153000 yeah i think i just heard something the other day it was like only
sw2708A-ms98-a-0087 421.153000 422.173500 [silence]
sw2708A-ms98-a-0088 422.173500 424.837000 it was either sixty percent or forty percent
sw2708A-ms98-a-0089 424.837000 426.612625 go to college
sw2708A-ms98-a-0090 426.612625 429.906875 and then out of that percentage only so many
sw2708A-ms98-a-0091 429.906875 431.747375 can get their degree
sw2708A-ms98-a-0092 431.747375 433.039500 [silence]
sw2708A-ms98-a-0093 433.039500 435.049625 so i thought that was interesting
sw2708A-ms98-a-0094 435.049625 436.148750 [silence]
sw2708A-ms98-a-0095 436.148750 441.278125 but uh you know most people i knew have gone and got their degree so
sw2708A-ms98-a-0096 441.278125 445.889000 [silence]
sw2708A-ms98-a-0097 445.889000 452.101750 yeah well i ju[st]- you know i uh was basic in a you know middle upper middle class area and
sw2708A-ms98-a-0098 452.101750 458.590250 yeah so i think uh that demographic area there you know a lot of them do go on
sw2708A-ms98-a-0099 458.590250 461.765750 and they go to college etcetera
sw2708A-ms98-a-0100 461.765750 492.096125 [silence]
sw2708A-ms98-a-0101 492.096125 493.302125 yeah
sw2708A-ms98-a-0102 493.302125 501.069875 [silence]
sw2708A-ms98-a-0103 501.069875 506.442625 well as [noise] as far as the you know the deficit that's a whole nother
sw2708A-ms98-a-0104 506.442625 519.535000 uh my perception of the budget you know the government and they have so much to spend and there's not enough money to spread around but the deficit basically is that the trade surplus between the other countries
sw2708A-ms98-a-0105 519.535000 529.109375 and that we have more money or goo[ds]- you know more money going out and too many goods coming into this country you know [noise] and um
sw2708A-ms98-a-0106 529.109375 538.560625 you know part of that problem i think is still you know uh like Japan still does not let us compete fairly in their country
sw2708A-ms98-a-0107 538.560625 545.050375 and and obviously the the demand for their goods is quite high here so they can get their goods in here
sw2708A-ms98-a-0108 545.050375 556.969500 and um you know to start even that out we need to continue to you know at least threaten that you know we're going to give them higher tariffs etcetera to raise their prices to you know ours
sw2708A-ms98-a-0109 556.969500 558.817000 but um
sw2708A-ms98-a-0110 558.817000 561.371625 it's just that uh
sw2708A-ms98-a-0111 561.371625 562.958000 they're in
sw2708A-ms98-a-0112 562.958000 570.604375 [noise] i think you're you're going to find that just because the United States you know there is such a demand here the market you know and uh
sw2708A-ms98-a-0113 570.604375 577.479875 uh the mon[ey]- you know money being spent and the goods flow in and we don't sell you know we don't uh
sw2708A-ms98-a-0114 577.479875 581.052500 sell products abroad as much as we bring in so
sw2708A-ms98-a-0115 581.052500 597.035625 [silence]
sw2708A-ms98-a-0116 597.035625 598.113625 hum-um
