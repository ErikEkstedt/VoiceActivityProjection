sw2708B-ms98-a-0002 7.844750 11.740500 uh [noise] my first comments on the budget
sw2708B-ms98-a-0003 11.740500 12.981250 [silence]
sw2708B-ms98-a-0004 12.981250 14.840000 i would say there has
sw2708B-ms98-a-0005 14.840000 19.480125 [silence]
sw2708B-ms98-a-0006 19.480125 21.916625 surprisingly no
sw2708B-ms98-a-0007 21.916625 26.290500 i would i would cut the prison systems and let them self-support
sw2708B-ms98-a-0008 26.290500 28.833125 [silence]
sw2708B-ms98-a-0009 28.833125 29.828625 hm
sw2708B-ms98-a-0010 29.828625 33.100000 [silence]
sw2708B-ms98-a-0011 33.100000 34.380000 you mean the prisons
sw2708B-ms98-a-0012 34.380000 49.169000 [silence]
sw2708B-ms98-a-0013 49.169000 51.020625 i hadn't heard that
sw2708B-ms98-a-0014 51.020625 55.266875 [silence]
sw2708B-ms98-a-0015 55.266875 56.460750 right
sw2708B-ms98-a-0016 56.460750 58.561875 [silence]
sw2708B-ms98-a-0017 58.561875 60.241625 but to me
sw2708B-ms98-a-0018 60.241625 80.870000 [silence]
sw2708B-ms98-a-0019 80.870000 87.634125 well see the other way i'm thinking about is they should be self-supporting like um the prisoners make
sw2708B-ms98-a-0020 87.634125 98.762125 license plates or farm or small industry inside the prisons anything to where they can be self-supporting within themselves in other words they're in there for a purpose put them to work
sw2708B-ms98-a-0021 98.762125 108.540250 rather than sitting there it's the same thing like the whole criminal i shouldn't say criminal but the whole police department of the United States i feel the same way
sw2708B-ms98-a-0022 108.540250 116.340250 uh someone gets picked up for drunk driving he should put enough in there that goes back into paying for that policeman being out there
sw2708B-ms98-a-0023 116.340250 117.598750 [silence]
sw2708B-ms98-a-0024 117.598750 121.304125 so it's self defen[se]- you know self-defense on that point
sw2708B-ms98-a-0025 121.304125 122.930750 um
sw2708B-ms98-a-0026 122.930750 125.805375 as far as my defense
sw2708B-ms98-a-0027 125.805375 127.366375 budget
sw2708B-ms98-a-0028 127.366375 134.273375 uh they're cutting it back now what twenty five percent i wouldn't want to see it cut any more than that
sw2708B-ms98-a-0029 134.273375 135.845250 [silence]
sw2708B-ms98-a-0030 135.845250 143.228250 but again i'd like to see something on the other end back into education but not in the education we have today
sw2708B-ms98-a-0031 143.228250 146.201750 so i'm lost on that one
sw2708B-ms98-a-0032 146.201750 147.480000 [silence]
sw2708B-ms98-a-0033 147.480000 149.756750 i would like to be a little more
sw2708B-ms98-a-0034 149.756750 156.022375 into investigating some of the other countries in the world and their educational problems
sw2708B-ms98-a-0035 156.022375 159.219375 and to come up with something a little better than what we've got
sw2708B-ms98-a-0036 159.219375 180.424375 [silence]
sw2708B-ms98-a-0037 180.424375 185.662250 well not so much pay i'm not trying to see the government put out any more
sw2708B-ms98-a-0038 185.662250 199.970625 [silence]
sw2708B-ms98-a-0039 199.970625 207.685500 yeah but see we don't even push the fact to the high school kids that there's other means of education out there rather than college
sw2708B-ms98-a-0040 207.685500 209.151000 [silence]
sw2708B-ms98-a-0041 209.151000 218.469125 to go either as an apprentice which they they do in other countries just doing this which i think would bring the education back up
sw2708B-ms98-a-0042 218.469125 220.992500 you know why not an apprentice out to a
sw2708B-ms98-a-0043 220.992500 226.790875 a company and learn from down on the bottom as a wood worker or
sw2708B-ms98-a-0044 226.790875 228.639500 you know just a technician
sw2708B-ms98-a-0045 228.639500 230.749500 you can learn on the job
sw2708B-ms98-a-0046 230.749500 239.754125 which of course again which m[ean]- would mean again our education budget will go down if this is in a few years i mean it's not going to be overnight
sw2708B-ms98-a-0047 239.754125 241.710625 but that would come down
sw2708B-ms98-a-0048 241.710625 285.780875 [silence]
sw2708B-ms98-a-0049 285.780875 294.400750 excuse me i see it being done i know of a friend that works for my lawyer that has had no training whatsoever and she's training her
sw2708B-ms98-a-0050 294.400750 336.604625 [silence]
sw2708B-ms98-a-0051 336.604625 340.383625 yes [laughter] wow [laughter] 
sw2708B-ms98-a-0052 340.383625 347.572500 [silence]
sw2708B-ms98-a-0053 347.572500 351.085000 yeah it sounded you were calling from around the world [laughter-somewhere] 
sw2708B-ms98-a-0054 351.085000 354.321000 [silence]
sw2708B-ms98-a-0055 354.321000 355.731375 we[ll]-
sw2708B-ms98-a-0056 355.731375 370.894375 [silence]
sw2708B-ms98-a-0057 370.894375 372.133375 um-hum
sw2708B-ms98-a-0058 372.133375 376.631875 [silence]
sw2708B-ms98-a-0059 376.631875 381.429875 well that's something about what Germany's supposed to be doing something similar to that right now
sw2708B-ms98-a-0060 381.429875 389.382375 and uh they have jobs out on you know bulletin boards so people know what is open for an apprentices in different fields
sw2708B-ms98-a-0061 389.382375 399.730625 but see that again would cut some of our budget down for education but build up our education with the people at people per at high school level
sw2708B-ms98-a-0062 399.730625 406.777875 which i would like to see rather than so many kids getting out of school they're they go on the unemployment list before we have turn around
sw2708B-ms98-a-0063 406.777875 418.015875 because they don't have any education i don't mean college and i'm for college but there's a lot of people that don't want their higher education as far as quote quote college is concerned they've had it
sw2708B-ms98-a-0064 418.015875 431.386250 [silence]
sw2708B-ms98-a-0065 431.386250 432.473250 um-hum
sw2708B-ms98-a-0066 432.473250 442.308375 [silence]
sw2708B-ms98-a-0067 442.308375 443.347500 oh yeah but
sw2708B-ms98-a-0068 443.347500 444.526625 [silence]
sw2708B-ms98-a-0069 444.526625 446.480000 there's a lot of them out there that haven't
sw2708B-ms98-a-0070 446.480000 448.649875 so that's
sw2708B-ms98-a-0071 448.649875 461.699375 [silence]
sw2708B-ms98-a-0072 461.699375 472.241125 well it seems to me that kids that a[re]- get out of high school that parents have gone to college and college here and college there that are really not interested in going to college and forced into it
sw2708B-ms98-a-0073 472.241125 480.766375 usually are your drop outs where if they're said hey it's just as advisable to go into something you enjoy and you like
sw2708B-ms98-a-0074 480.766375 492.960250 because you can get just as far as being a journeyman carpenter or an electrician or plumber or anything else like that make as much money and if they enjoy it more they'll make a lo[t]- happier life for themselves
sw2708B-ms98-a-0075 492.960250 500.663625 question you threw that question on me about the deficit put it on your shoe now what would you do
sw2708B-ms98-a-0076 500.663625 580.570000 [silence]
sw2708B-ms98-a-0077 580.570000 589.809250 were you watching i think uh one of the news stations i couldn't even tell you which one i watched but they had on there where the
sw2708B-ms98-a-0078 589.809250 598.612375 the output from the United States was basically from smaller businesses rather than the larger ones are exporting
