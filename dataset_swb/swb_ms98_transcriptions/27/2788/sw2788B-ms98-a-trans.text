sw2788B-ms98-a-0004 7.581125 11.645875 and we had kind of a hard time finding someplace that would
sw2788B-ms98-a-0005 11.645875 16.689250 we could put Michael's because_1 his birthday is the first of September and he was going to school at five
sw2788B-ms98-a-0006 16.689250 17.710500 [silence]
sw2788B-ms98-a-0007 17.710500 20.657875 so he started the first grade when he was five or started
sw2788B-ms98-a-0008 20.657875 22.940500 yeah first grade when he was five years old
sw2788B-ms98-a-0009 22.940500 24.840750 [silence]
sw2788B-ms98-a-0010 24.840750 29.805750 yeah so we could you know we tried to find him someplace where he could learn something
sw2788B-ms98-a-0011 29.805750 31.579250 and it was
sw2788B-ms98-a-0012 31.579250 32.681625 uh 
sw2788B-ms98-a-0013 32.681625 40.630000 me[diocore]- mediocre expensive it wasn't really that expensive but it's really hard to find someplace where you can send your child and expect him to learn something

sw2788B-ms98-a-0021 58.787375 60.855500 my wife works so
sw2788B-ms98-a-0022 60.855500 65.730750 it costs us more for her to stay home more than it does for him to go to the babysitter so
sw2788B-ms98-a-0023 65.730750 68.292500 okay
sw2788B-ms98-a-0024 68.292500 80.168875 [silence]

sw2788B-ms98-a-0033 98.987000 103.091500 well see we took our time and we checked it out and we found a preschool for him
sw2788B-ms98-a-0034 103.091500 105.257750 and it you know through other
sw2788B-ms98-a-0035 105.257750 108.480875 folks where i where i work i work at TI
sw2788B-ms98-a-0036 108.480875 110.690750 so through other folks where we worked we
sw2788B-ms98-a-0037 110.690750 114.596500 found a nice preschool it was actually at a licensed preschool you know we
sw2788B-ms98-a-0038 114.596500 116.300750 had those requirements
sw2788B-ms98-a-0039 116.300750 117.404875 so

sw2788B-ms98-a-0042 120.023000 123.209375 you know i well that and
sw2788B-ms98-a-0043 123.209375 127.421125 you know i don't think i would have left him anywhere that would i would have stayed home with him [laughter-first]
sw2788B-ms98-a-0044 127.421125 132.827125 before i left him somewhere that you know they still have unlicensed babysitters running around up here and
sw2788B-ms98-a-0045 132.827125 136.106875 you know i just i- i don't think i'd take that chance
sw2788B-ms98-a-0046 136.106875 138.756625 you know i think it's out of sight or out of mind for less than
sw2788B-ms98-a-0047 138.756625 141.790375 for more than a minute or so
sw2788B-ms98-a-0048 141.790375 144.240000 [silence]
sw2788B-ms98-a-0049 144.240000 145.652125 but you never know

sw2788B-ms98-a-0054 152.386750 154.347250 but you you know
sw2788B-ms98-a-0055 154.347250 158.036625 as far as brittle as child abuse is these days you never know
sw2788B-ms98-a-0056 158.036625 160.447125 you don't know who you can trust and who you can't
sw2788B-ms98-a-0057 160.447125 161.716250 you know
sw2788B-ms98-a-0058 161.716250 167.193250 [silence]
sw2788B-ms98-a-0059 167.193250 169.590000 yeah senior care is getting real bad

sw2788B-ms98-a-0061 177.670625 178.708250 yeah
sw2788B-ms98-a-0062 178.708250 181.080875 so you have no children at all huh
sw2788B-ms98-a-0063 181.080875 182.164875 gee 
sw2788B-ms98-a-0064 182.164875 183.488125 [silence]
sw2788B-ms98-a-0065 183.488125 185.284000 do you miss that part in your life or
sw2788B-ms98-a-0066 185.284000 187.852750 [silence]
sw2788B-ms98-a-0067 187.852750 188.933500 yeah
sw2788B-ms98-a-0068 188.933500 190.063375 [silence]
sw2788B-ms98-a-0069 190.063375 191.152125 yeah yeah
sw2788B-ms98-a-0070 191.152125 193.712750 [silence]
sw2788B-ms98-a-0071 193.712750 198.426625 i imagine yeah working in the news production anyway back to the subject 
sw2788B-ms98-a-0072 198.426625 204.472000 we should have discussed this earlier but [laughter-anyway] it's tough it really is it's hard to find
sw2788B-ms98-a-0073 204.472000 211.827750 good child care and it's hard to find someplace where you can leave your child and trust that he's going to be fine all day long
sw2788B-ms98-a-0074 211.827750 213.152500 and
sw2788B-ms98-a-0075 213.152500 219.005375 [silence]
sw2788B-ms98-a-0076 219.005375 228.802125 yeah you know and he's he's doing real well it it it has paid off for him he's in first grade now and he's you know got a second grade reading level and a fourth grade math level
sw2788B-ms98-a-0077 228.802125 236.495625 so you know those early ages when he would you know when his mom and dad are at work and he's actually in child care in a preschool not
sw2788B-ms98-a-0078 236.495625 243.017375 just child care you know we could have sent him to anybody you know there's a lot people at work that would have babysat him but
sw2788B-ms98-a-0079 243.017375 251.901625 sending him to a preschool where he actually learns something has paid off not only for us his his attitude is i think a little bit
sw2788B-ms98-a-0080 251.901625 254.358750 tall for a six year old and
sw2788B-ms98-a-0081 254.358750 255.628125 you know but his
sw2788B-ms98-a-0082 255.628125 259.083250 [silence]
sw2788B-ms98-a-0083 259.083250 262.034750 um they they were outside my marriage so
sw2788B-ms98-a-0084 262.034750 263.280750 i don't know
sw2788B-ms98-a-0085 263.280750 265.294250 i would say no but
sw2788B-ms98-a-0086 265.294250 272.230125 you know all my children excel they're they're really good and i guess no he learns from the older boys too but
sw2788B-ms98-a-0087 272.230125 275.073500 [silence]
sw2788B-ms98-a-0088 275.073500 276.516875 yeah yeah
sw2788B-ms98-a-0089 276.516875 277.689875 [silence]
sw2788B-ms98-a-0090 277.689875 284.344625 yeah seeing like uh in one way we're kind of lucky because_1 they're all boys but in another way we're not so lucky because_1 we don't have
sw2788B-ms98-a-0091 284.344625 287.540125 another woman in the house for my wife to share but
sw2788B-ms98-a-0092 287.540125 288.941500 [silence]
sw2788B-ms98-a-0093 288.941500 290.910375 so we faced that too but
sw2788B-ms98-a-0094 290.910375 293.315875 he learns quite a bit he learned quite a bit from
sw2788B-ms98-a-0095 293.315875 297.536375 not only from nursery school but he learned quite a bit from the older boys and
sw2788B-ms98-a-0096 297.536375 301.527000 you know he's excelled and it's paying off for him it really is he's
sw2788B-ms98-a-0097 301.527000 309.483250 he is pretty smart sometimes he's a little bit smart mouthed but [laughter-he] [laughter-is] [laughter-smart] you know yeah
sw2788B-ms98-a-0098 309.483250 310.737750 [silence]
sw2788B-ms98-a-0099 310.737750 311.745000 but
sw2788B-ms98-a-0100 311.745000 315.491875 i think it's important i think it's really nice to know that you can
sw2788B-ms98-a-0101 315.491875 321.707000 find someplace i don't know you know how it is down there in Waco but in Lubbock we have a few that you can
sw2788B-ms98-a-0102 321.707000 326.736625 send your children to and they can actually learn something instead of just being babysat
sw2788B-ms98-a-0103 326.736625 327.898875 and
sw2788B-ms98-a-0104 327.898875 330.351875 [silence]
sw2788B-ms98-a-0105 330.351875 331.982250 no not any
sw2788B-ms98-a-0106 331.982250 333.132500 huh-uh
sw2788B-ms98-a-0107 333.132500 334.171625 we just
sw2788B-ms98-a-0108 334.171625 335.668750 [silence]
sw2788B-ms98-a-0109 335.668750 340.083375 yeah they're trying to the federal government is trying to insist on that too so
sw2788B-ms98-a-0110 340.083375 340.940250 [silence]
sw2788B-ms98-a-0111 340.940250 342.690250 no we don't yet
sw2788B-ms98-a-0112 342.690250 344.194125 well it would be nice
sw2788B-ms98-a-0113 344.194125 345.228125 you know there 
sw2788B-ms98-a-0114 345.228125 349.858500 [silence]
sw2788B-ms98-a-0115 349.858500 351.117250 yeah there's not well
sw2788B-ms98-a-0116 351.117250 352.832375 [silence]
sw2788B-ms98-a-0117 352.832375 359.791000 you know where where we sent Michael the first few years was there was different teachers all the time you know some
sw2788B-ms98-a-0118 359.791000 368.550250 girls were there in the morning and then some substitute teachers in the afternoon and they actually taught him something instead of just watching him all day
sw2788B-ms98-a-0119 368.550250 378.007250 you know and then he they had a group of kids and they put on skits and they put on plays and they did the Halloween thing and the Valentine's Day things
sw2788B-ms98-a-0120 378.007250 384.516750 and it's you know it was important to us so we you know we took a good look at it and made sure it was going to go that way
sw2788B-ms98-a-0121 384.516750 391.054500 [silence]
sw2788B-ms98-a-0122 391.054500 392.231375 um
sw2788B-ms98-a-0123 392.231375 393.924750 [silence]
sw2788B-ms98-a-0124 393.924750 395.371750 no because i think
sw2788B-ms98-a-0125 395.371750 399.723625 you know as a child growing up i think is a task that belongs to his parents
sw2788B-ms98-a-0126 399.723625 403.151000 i don't think he needed to be attached to too even though he did
sw2788B-ms98-a-0127 403.151000 406.211000 you know he attached himself to a couple of those but
sw2788B-ms98-a-0128 406.211000 419.002125 i think his attachments at home and you know he gets the idea of what school is for and uh you know i have different teachers here and this person can teach me one thing and this person teach teach me another and
sw2788B-ms98-a-0129 419.002125 420.061000 [silence]
sw2788B-ms98-a-0130 420.061000 426.184375 no so i- i- i really can't say that it would be it's important for him to attach himself to anybody
sw2788B-ms98-a-0131 426.184375 430.844250 he did well you it it with another child i can't say that
sw2788B-ms98-a-0132 430.844250 433.001500 because_1 i don't have that experience
sw2788B-ms98-a-0133 433.001500 434.518875 yeah see
sw2788B-ms98-a-0134 434.518875 439.158750 but i don't have that experience so i can't say that you know he did well so
sw2788B-ms98-a-0135 439.158750 441.452000 i don't think we made too many mistakes
sw2788B-ms98-a-0136 441.452000 442.570250 [silence]
sw2788B-ms98-a-0137 442.570250 443.845125 we tried hard
sw2788B-ms98-a-0138 443.845125 445.675000 yeah he's doing real well
sw2788B-ms98-a-0139 445.675000 454.331875 and he learned from it so and that was the most important thing that we wanted was for him to learn not just to sit there and be babysat all day
sw2788B-ms98-a-0140 454.331875 456.686875 you know babysat sounds to me like
sw2788B-ms98-a-0141 456.686875 463.976250 well you're here i guess i'll watch you when i get time you know maybe i'll clean my house maybe i'll cook you lunch maybe i won't
sw2788B-ms98-a-0142 463.976250 465.193250 you know and
sw2788B-ms98-a-0143 465.193250 466.357625 [silence]
sw2788B-ms98-a-0144 466.357625 467.707750 yeah yeah
sw2788B-ms98-a-0145 467.707750 471.716250 yeah and i don't you know i don't allow that when he's at home so
sw2788B-ms98-a-0146 471.716250 472.768500 but
sw2788B-ms98-a-0147 472.768500 474.103500 [silence]
sw2788B-ms98-a-0148 474.103500 476.783375 we had a good experience and we really did well
sw2788B-ms98-a-0149 476.783375 477.806750 [silence]
sw2788B-ms98-a-0150 477.806750 479.446625 so and he didn't
sw2788B-ms98-a-0151 479.446625 480.492500 he served
sw2788B-ms98-a-0152 480.492500 481.598375 [silence]
sw2788B-ms98-a-0153 481.598375 489.310125 better than we did you know he gained he actually gained from it you know sure we gained from it because we were allowed to continue our employment and
sw2788B-ms98-a-0154 489.310125 494.038250 continue our family but i think in the long run he gained from it just
sw2788B-ms98-a-0155 494.038250 499.512750 being somewhere where we learned something instead of just sitting around watching TV and playing all day
sw2788B-ms98-a-0156 499.512750 500.804250 and its important
sw2788B-ms98-a-0157 500.804250 503.187125 [silence]
sw2788B-ms98-a-0158 503.187125 504.396625 yeah
