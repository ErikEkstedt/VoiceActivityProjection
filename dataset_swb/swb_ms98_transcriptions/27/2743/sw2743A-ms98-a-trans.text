sw2743A-ms98-a-0005 14.875250 16.703625 very good
sw2743A-ms98-a-0006 16.703625 25.933750 good well wh[at]- do you think that uh consumer goods goods are generally getting better or worse in quality
sw2743A-ms98-a-0007 25.933750 29.977000 [silence]
sw2743A-ms98-a-0008 29.977000 31.779000 i do too
sw2743A-ms98-a-0009 31.779000 37.517750 i believe about ten years ago that we went through a terrible time
sw2743A-ms98-a-0010 37.517750 38.551125 [silence]
sw2743A-ms98-a-0011 38.551125 42.511375 but i don't i- i believe that they're better now than they were
sw2743A-ms98-a-0012 42.511375 48.305875 [silence]
sw2743A-ms98-a-0013 48.305875 55.906000 however i didn't like it very well when the transmission went out on my car with sixty three thousand miles on it
sw2743A-ms98-a-0014 55.906000 67.748875 [laughter] and i don't like it very well if when my electric blanket that was only one year old went out at uh on one side
sw2743A-ms98-a-0015 67.748875 69.650375 [silence]
sw2743A-ms98-a-0016 69.650375 72.472375 no i had moved away
sw2743A-ms98-a-0017 72.472375 81.308625 i had taken the first one back i didn't think that it heated well enough it never did get [noise] anything but just moderately warm
sw2743A-ms98-a-0018 81.308625 92.039625 took it back and [vocalized-noise] um the people told me well that's the way it's supposed to be and i fell for it and uh when i got this one
sw2743A-ms98-a-0019 92.039625 99.912625 it did a litt[le]- it heated a little bit warmer and then after one year it started heating only on one side
sw2743A-ms98-a-0020 99.912625 103.516000 [silence]
sw2743A-ms98-a-0021 103.516000 114.941875 [laughter] also i took an iron back after having it only one year
sw2743A-ms98-a-0022 114.941875 120.373875 now i figure th[at]- uh anybody that is dumb enough to iron
sw2743A-ms98-a-0023 120.373875 130.627125 needs to have an iron that will last a long time and one year of ironing only once a week is not long enough for it to last
sw2743A-ms98-a-0024 130.627125 132.073500 [silence]
sw2743A-ms98-a-0025 132.073500 136.920375 well without even any question but i think it was the store

sw2743A-ms98-a-0032 168.393000 170.057000 [silence]
sw2743A-ms98-a-0033 170.057000 176.892500 i wondered if it weren't expensive and they should have put buttons on it that [noise] would last forever
