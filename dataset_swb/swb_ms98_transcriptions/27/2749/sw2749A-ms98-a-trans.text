sw2749A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.560875 [noise]
sw2749A-ms98-a-0002 1.560875 9.259875 well um i don't have strong feelings about changes to be made in the uh jury system do you
sw2749A-ms98-a-0003 9.259875 19.064625 [silence]
sw2749A-ms98-a-0004 19.064625 22.050250 oh well then you must know a lot more about this than i do
sw2749A-ms98-a-0005 22.050250 26.429125 [noise]
sw2749A-ms98-a-0006 26.429125 37.735000 [silence]
sw2749A-ms98-a-0007 37.735000 39.515375 um-hum um-hum
sw2749A-ms98-a-0008 39.515375 45.076375 [silence]
sw2749A-ms98-a-0009 45.076375 51.112125 well what about the idea that one is only guilty uh when proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt
sw2749A-ms98-a-0010 51.112125 56.758625 i thought that was the point of uh a unanimous jury was the idea that if everyone agrees
sw2749A-ms98-a-0011 56.758625 61.052625 then there shouldn't be any reasonable doubt but if there are some people who don't agree
sw2749A-ms98-a-0012 61.052625 66.271625 um then there must be it seems to be there must be at least a reasonable doubt for some people
sw2749A-ms98-a-0013 66.271625 89.609500 [silence]
sw2749A-ms98-a-0014 89.609500 91.812750 really have you served on a jury
sw2749A-ms98-a-0015 91.812750 97.192000 i never have either but my friends my few friends who have uh say just the opposite [laughter]
sw2749A-ms98-a-0016 97.192000 100.282250 they say they're uh remarkably incompetent
sw2749A-ms98-a-0017 100.282250 109.674375 and uh don't know what they're doing and say one thing in the courtroom and then as soon as they get in the back room they just start letting all their prejudices hang out and to to air and all that
sw2749A-ms98-a-0018 109.674375 129.765125 [silence]
sw2749A-ms98-a-0019 129.765125 135.920500 right in other words they don't want anyone with exper[ience]- anyone with particular experience or knowledge of the legal system
sw2749A-ms98-a-0020 135.920500 140.965875 and they tend and since anyone can get out of it who
sw2749A-ms98-a-0021 140.965875 146.644875 basically says they don't want to do it i mean you know it's it's anyone can get out of jury just about
sw2749A-ms98-a-0022 146.644875 154.017125 and uh so it it's um it's not really my peers that if i were arr[ested]- let's say i were arrested falsely or not
sw2749A-ms98-a-0023 154.017125 161.819000 and put up for a jury i wouldn't feel that uh i would be being tried by a jury of my peers i'd be i mean i'd be tried by a jury of
sw2749A-ms98-a-0024 161.819000 171.687625 you know people who had nothing else to do and weren't very knowledgeable about certain sorts of things and uh i don't know i i get a little bit nervous about it and uh
sw2749A-ms98-a-0025 171.687625 175.677750 [silence]
sw2749A-ms98-a-0026 175.677750 183.925125 yeah i i was called once but i was out of the country and apparently i apparently they thought i served so i didn't i didn't make any noise about it [laughter]
sw2749A-ms98-a-0027 183.925125 189.114125 i came back and they said the record showed i served but i was out of the country at the time so i'm pretty sure i didn't
sw2749A-ms98-a-0028 189.114125 190.381500 um
sw2749A-ms98-a-0029 190.381500 201.602250 [silence]
sw2749A-ms98-a-0030 201.602250 209.516625 yeah well i [noise] i i don't know i- i definitely feel like we need to keep it at least unanimous because um 
sw2749A-ms98-a-0031 209.516625 216.572000 you know there's the classic sort of To Kill A Mockingbird kind of story where you get you know jury which [noise]
sw2749A-ms98-a-0032 216.572000 223.666875 can have all kinds of prejudices and things that a judge at least officially isn't supposed to have though of course they can too
sw2749A-ms98-a-0033 223.666875 230.567375 and um it seems to me that if you could just have a simple majority or something you could pretty much brow[beat]- you know
sw2749A-ms98-a-0034 230.567375 236.683625 browbeat the jury a majority in the of the a majority of the jury that's hard to say um
sw2749A-ms98-a-0035 236.683625 243.016875 so it's it's uh you know saying well look you know we don't like the way he looks and let's uh let's throw the rascal in jail and stuff 
sw2749A-ms98-a-0036 243.016875 252.975625 and you also get a lot of um juries are extremely uh and from what i hear i i have i have some friends who do expert [wist/witness] witness testimony
sw2749A-ms98-a-0037 252.975625 260.539125 and they say that uh juries are extremely vulnerable to uh sort of emotional pitches you know the prosecutor will want to uh [noise]
sw2749A-ms98-a-0038 260.539125 269.779500 oh i don't know show the show the mugging victim you know show what the nice person he was and what a family life and basically get the jury to be very sympathetic with the victim
sw2749A-ms98-a-0039 269.779500 284.308625 and uh or or uh if it's a corporation that was uh you know har[ming]- harming some individual or something like that they get very much well you know it's just a big faceless comp[any]- corporation let's let's make them pay as much as possible things like that
sw2749A-ms98-a-0040 284.308625 295.473500 so not i i mean i'm the problem is i can't guarantee that a ju[dge]- judge would be necessarily be much better than a jury but i'd be real nervous having a jury not at least fully agree
sw2749A-ms98-a-0041 295.473500 298.330875 on what the settlements would be on things like that
sw2749A-ms98-a-0042 298.330875 301.200375 [silence]
sw2749A-ms98-a-0043 301.200375 302.545000 yeah
sw2749A-ms98-a-0044 302.545000 304.221250 [silence]
sw2749A-ms98-a-0045 304.221250 305.483125 um-hum
sw2749A-ms98-a-0046 305.483125 312.176875 [silence]
sw2749A-ms98-a-0047 312.176875 318.774625 well how about having a ju[ry]- jury and a judge work together on it somehow i wonder if that's possible
sw2749A-ms98-a-0048 318.774625 321.630250 [noise] i guess the judge's time is worth too much though
sw2749A-ms98-a-0049 321.630250 322.949125 [laughter]
sw2749A-ms98-a-0050 322.949125 332.468250 they pay that judge they pay those jury members very little money compared to that judge [laughter] he makes more money in an hour than all twelve of them put together [laughter]
sw2749A-ms98-a-0051 332.468250 348.674750 [silence]
sw2749A-ms98-a-0052 348.674750 350.482125 um-hum um-hum
sw2749A-ms98-a-0053 350.482125 358.165125 [silence]
sw2749A-ms98-a-0054 358.165125 371.445375 oh of course it's it's political maneuvering the the one side is looking for someone whose face they think will you know want to hang everyone and the other one is going to look for someone very sympathetic they're not looking for someone whose going to be the most reasoned
sw2749A-ms98-a-0055 371.445375 382.718750 or sensible or rational juror neither side wants that they want to find a juror that's going to uh be most persuadable by their arguments you you know 
sw2749A-ms98-a-0056 382.718750 389.052125 um i wish it were a little bit harder to not serve on juries actually i mean i know
sw2749A-ms98-a-0057 389.052125 396.136750 it it it's tricky because_1 i know you know an awful lot of intelligent people who just well i'm too busy to serve on a jury so i'll tell them that and they won't
sw2749A-ms98-a-0058 396.136750 404.219500 or just you know just answer one of the questions the wrong way because you can do that you know they just say do you believe in such and such um
sw2749A-ms98-a-0059 404.219500 414.647625 [silence]
sw2749A-ms98-a-0060 414.647625 419.755000 right course they'd be they would be barred but [laughter]
sw2749A-ms98-a-0061 419.755000 422.013625 [silence]
sw2749A-ms98-a-0062 422.013625 423.326750 um-hum
sw2749A-ms98-a-0063 423.326750 428.668500 [silence]
sw2749A-ms98-a-0064 428.668500 434.454125 yeah well it sounds like we both need to get out there and serve on a jury i i hope we're called up before too long
sw2749A-ms98-a-0065 434.454125 437.474625 [silence]
sw2749A-ms98-a-0066 437.474625 440.061375 they will they will eventually
sw2749A-ms98-a-0067 440.061375 442.709875 [laughter] okay well it was nice talking with you
sw2749A-ms98-a-0068 442.709875 444.313125 bye-bye
