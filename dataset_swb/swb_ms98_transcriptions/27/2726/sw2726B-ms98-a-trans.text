sw2726B-ms98-a-0023 79.728000 88.498125 [noise] but it it you know we looked at a lot of houses that were had more square footage but they didn't use it right you know it was a bunch of empty
sw2726B-ms98-a-0024 88.498125 96.775000 you know hallway and stuff that [vocalized-noise] yeah yeah really so we've used every bit of it and our house um
sw2726B-ms98-a-0025 96.775000 102.999500 we bought it for sixty four and uh the neighbors house next door to us sold for seventy five
sw2726B-ms98-a-0026 102.999500 113.217375 so i- you know i think we were [vocalized-noise] you know got a good deal on it considering yeah yeah yeah well
sw2726B-ms98-a-0027 113.217375 115.984750 [silence]
sw2726B-ms98-a-0028 115.984750 120.993750 oh really my husband's from New Jersey [laughter]
sw2726B-ms98-a-0029 120.993750 152.500000 [silence]
sw2726B-ms98-a-0030 152.500000 156.507250 yeah that's what we were looking for the first thing
sw2726B-ms98-a-0031 156.507250 167.765000 [silence]
sw2726B-ms98-a-0032 167.765000 174.020375 wow um-hum yeah
sw2726B-ms98-a-0033 174.020375 175.754750 [silence]
sw2726B-ms98-a-0034 175.754750 188.034625 but that's what we had uh uh that's what we had looked for was our main concern was a big living room you know and big closet space you know i said
sw2726B-ms98-a-0035 188.034625 189.969750 [silence]
sw2726B-ms98-a-0036 189.969750 191.767125 yeah
sw2726B-ms98-a-0037 191.767125 193.458875 yeah
sw2726B-ms98-a-0038 193.458875 202.190625 and uh so that's that's what we went for first and and it you know we we don't we just have a big living room an and a dining room is separate
sw2726B-ms98-a-0039 202.190625 210.683750 and you know some places have like the house next door to us that we looked at had a living room a dining room and a den but to stick a wall between two rooms
sw2726B-ms98-a-0040 210.683750 220.957250 didn't do anything for us just so we could have a living room and a den so we opted for the just the whole wide room that went from one end of the house to the other just about
sw2726B-ms98-a-0041 220.957250 228.483500 [silence]
sw2726B-ms98-a-0042 228.483500 229.963500 [noise] yeah

sw2726B-ms98-a-0051 251.007000 259.980750 right i but i- i think for where we are um i think we got a real good deal on it and we you know we have a uh
sw2726B-ms98-a-0052 259.980750 266.278500 the backyard is just huge it is just really i think another house could fit back there
sw2726B-ms98-a-0053 266.278500 278.972875 and uh we really liked it of course when you have to mow it [laughter] you know in uh middle of August it's it's kind of a little hot yeah but uh it's it's nice and that was
sw2726B-ms98-a-0054 278.972875 286.491625 you know a big selling point too and i think another thing that was really nice was that our neighbors on the other side of us bought the lot right next to us
sw2726B-ms98-a-0055 286.491625 296.700000 and they've lived there and have it all built up you know they've got a whole garden and trees and everything so it's not like we're uh kind of secluded you know we don't have a neighbor's fence coming up to ours
sw2726B-ms98-a-0056 296.700000 305.218875 you know right up to our bathroom window or whatever it is like a lot of the little model homes that they [vocalized-noise] you know throw up in three days

sw2726B-ms98-a-0060 310.181500 318.485625 no no not at all in fact uh we we talked about that just a little bit you know we were joking around about uh
sw2726B-ms98-a-0061 318.485625 330.768000 winning a sweepstakes and what would we do with the money and Steve said we'll i'll buy a bigger house and i said no i would just fix this one [laughter] you know there's you know because_1 we i like where it is and i like how it's laid out and it took us forever
sw2726B-ms98-a-0062 330.768000 336.477625 to find it but when we found it it was we knew it yeah
sw2726B-ms98-a-0063 336.477625 339.957625 [silence]

sw2726B-ms98-a-0076 369.735375 379.444125 um yeah and that's and that's one thing is once you you know you get into a house it's like y[ou]- you get more stuff
sw2726B-ms98-a-0077 379.444125 393.497500 and to put it all back into an apartment would just never work [vocalized-noise] God i can't believe we moved out of an apartment and had this much stuff and it actually fit you know of course we got it on a little bit of more furniture and stuff but
sw2726B-ms98-a-0078 393.497500 396.765250 [silence]

sw2726B-ms98-a-0085 420.733250 432.212375 yeah and that's actually three fifteen over there's probably not real real bad for for Waco and and for as many gosh as many as apartments and condos are over there
sw2726B-ms98-a-0086 432.212375 440.995875 i mean it it's just and and especially around Lake Shore area that area's picked up quite a bit since we were there and uh
sw2726B-ms98-a-0087 440.995875 454.359375 yeah because_1 i- i had lived in the gosh i'm not sure what they're called now but they were Lake Shore Apartments that are like right next to this baseball field MCC Baseball field but 
sw2726B-ms98-a-0088 454.359375 460.243875 no the ones next door to those there were Lake Shore there's a i don't know what they look like now
sw2726B-ms98-a-0089 460.243875 473.971750 yeah there was a nursing home and then there's an apartment and then there's another apartment and we lived in those those third ones and they we moved in when they were brand new uh you know we drive by now and think gosh you know look how much it's changed an
sw2726B-ms98-a-0090 473.971750 478.786000 [noise] oh ever now and then um it just we
sw2726B-ms98-a-0091 478.786000 486.183750 it's uh yeah and it's not really now that it's sixty five it doesn't take hardly anytime to get there you know run to the mall or run to Sam's or
sw2726B-ms98-a-0092 486.183750 500.485000 whatever we used to run to R[ed]- you know Red Lobster but now they've got one in Killeen [laughter-so] [laughter-we] [laughter-don't] [laughter-have] [laughter-to] [laughter-run] [laughter-that] [laughter-far] so that's that's about how things are and the seems like the market here's picking up yeah i really think it is 
sw2726B-ms98-a-0093 500.485000 502.691875 just for the fact that the
sw2726B-ms98-a-0094 502.691875 504.302750 you know it's
sw2726B-ms98-a-0095 504.302750 507.495750 it seemed like as soon as we bought this house
sw2726B-ms98-a-0096 507.495750 519.492500 we saw all these houses for sale you know and i think now a lot of them_1 are selling and a lot of sellers are getting close to what they want instead of you know just having to give it away
