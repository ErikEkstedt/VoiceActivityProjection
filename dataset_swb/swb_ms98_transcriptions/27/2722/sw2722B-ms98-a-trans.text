sw2722B-ms98-a-0014 79.468875 83.207625 i do want to keep up and know what's going on and
sw2722B-ms98-a-0015 83.207625 89.803500 it helps i don't often uh have time to sit down and watch the evening news kind of thing but
sw2722B-ms98-a-0016 89.803500 93.750750 if i'm around during the daytime and have a chance i'll switch on CNN
sw2722B-ms98-a-0017 93.750750 98.220875 [noise] always have watched CNN ever since we
sw2722B-ms98-a-0018 98.220875 99.843750 got the cable
sw2722B-ms98-a-0019 99.843750 112.130375 uh you know coverage that provided for that and have always enjoyed it and am glad to see them getting a little uh boost these days since the uh war a little more uh recognition and credibility
sw2722B-ms98-a-0020 112.130375 114.469625 i've i uh
sw2722B-ms98-a-0021 114.469625 119.682625 have access to Time and Newsweek and The Wall Street Journal all of which i
sw2722B-ms98-a-0022 119.682625 124.479500 rely on more i think than what i get over network
sw2722B-ms98-a-0023 124.479500 126.981125 TV news
sw2722B-ms98-a-0024 126.981125 135.131625 and like you you know knowledgeable friends i work for a fellow who is uh in the oil industry internationally
sw2722B-ms98-a-0025 135.131625 144.940750 and travels a lot to third world countries and all around and i feel like a lot of times what we get from his contacts is far more valid
sw2722B-ms98-a-0026 144.940750 156.635500 then you know but that's only in a real specialized area you know that's n[ot]- that's just political it's not the medical arena it's not technology particularly although sometimes it overlaps
sw2722B-ms98-a-0027 156.635500 163.955125 into those kinds of things but i don't think i would be satisfied if all i had was just television
sw2722B-ms98-a-0028 163.955125 167.608625 you know the uh the newspapers i think
sw2722B-ms98-a-0029 167.608625 169.569750 [silence]
sw2722B-ms98-a-0030 169.569750 176.006375 you know they uh i think a lot of the meat of what i get out [vocalized-noise] out of the [vocalized-noise] newspaper's not on the front page
sw2722B-ms98-a-0031 176.006375 178.709250 [silence]

sw2722B-ms98-a-0042 212.609500 215.454125 there's more information in one
sw2722B-ms98-a-0043 215.454125 221.080375 than an entire month magazine you know monthly periodical
sw2722B-ms98-a-0044 221.080375 222.374625 and
sw2722B-ms98-a-0045 222.374625 234.007875 a lot of times i'll just take the whole thing soon as i get it and i take out the sections i want trash the rest otherwise you like you say the the stack of paper is so large

sw2722B-ms98-a-0047 234.646625 238.018750 it's unmanageable just in your home situation [laughter]

sw2722B-ms98-a-0054 250.227875 255.987375 [silence]
sw2722B-ms98-a-0055 255.987375 259.606750 i- i'm not familiar with that one

sw2722B-ms98-a-0059 274.699625 277.180375 [silence]
sw2722B-ms98-a-0060 277.180375 283.079625 well i'm a nonfiction oriented kind of person anyway oh i enjoy a good novel
sw2722B-ms98-a-0061 283.079625 289.806250 but you know given the choice in the doctor's office when they're all lined up i'm much more apt to grab the
sw2722B-ms98-a-0062 289.806250 295.336000 Time or Newsweek or US News and World Reports than i ever would People or
sw2722B-ms98-a-0063 295.336000 302.297625 McCall's or although i've you know i read those kinds of things too occasionally and and and find things that are current and
sw2722B-ms98-a-0064 302.297625 306.024750 updated but i don't know i just just my particular
sw2722B-ms98-a-0065 306.024750 307.879000 predisposition i
sw2722B-ms98-a-0066 307.879000 315.953125 i tend more the other way so i try not to ever find myself in a situation without something to read because my reading time comes in
sw2722B-ms98-a-0067 315.953125 318.881500 little snatches [laughter] i have five kids [laughter]
sw2722B-ms98-a-0068 318.881500 321.998625 [noise] so by the time i get around to
sw2722B-ms98-a-0069 321.998625 327.176875 actually reading i ha[ve]- you know i may have ten or fifteen minutes of slot
sw2722B-ms98-a-0070 327.176875 329.001625 to read so
sw2722B-ms98-a-0071 329.001625 330.222875 [silence]
sw2722B-ms98-a-0072 330.222875 331.212625 uh-huh
sw2722B-ms98-a-0073 331.212625 333.306375 well they're good kids
sw2722B-ms98-a-0074 333.306375 338.610500 and this you know this is another reason though i think that ah
sw2722B-ms98-a-0075 338.610500 346.455625 makes me real aware and encouraging because i know there's always a a a tidbit of information that's going to come across some
sw2722B-ms98-a-0076 346.455625 352.141750 i'm either gonna read it or i'm gonna hear it that they can turn right around and use in a report
sw2722B-ms98-a-0077 352.141750 359.899625 so if i hear a statistic that's interesting or whatnot even just driving in the car i'll make a little note and uh
sw2722B-ms98-a-0078 359.899625 365.174875 you know of where that came from and the time i heard it and whatnot so they can use that in a bibliography
sw2722B-ms98-a-0079 365.174875 368.043875 [silence]
sw2722B-ms98-a-0080 368.043875 375.455875 i hope so i hope so i think kids tend to watch news for the sensationalism
sw2722B-ms98-a-0081 375.455875 382.319250 my kids love to watch the news but it's not always you know you wonder if it's for the right reason
sw2722B-ms98-a-0082 382.319250 386.089750 [laughter-not] [laughter-just] [laughter-the] [laughter-gore]
sw2722B-ms98-a-0083 386.089750 389.419000 yeah yeah but i think it's a good habit to
sw2722B-ms98-a-0084 389.419000 391.084000 to establish uh
sw2722B-ms98-a-0085 391.084000 392.715750 [silence]
sw2722B-ms98-a-0086 392.715750 396.165000 thank you so much and uh
