sw2732B-ms98-a-0004 7.756375 8.983500 okay

sw2732B-ms98-a-0006 10.488625 14.098750 all right we'll start twenty years back and come forward how's that sound
sw2732B-ms98-a-0007 14.098750 14.999000 all right
sw2732B-ms98-a-0008 14.999000 23.264875 [silence]
sw2732B-ms98-a-0009 23.264875 32.195000 well yeah i think they have i- i really do and it's it's no longer the issue it once was and i'm kind of glad least i- i hope that's a good sign that uh
sw2732B-ms98-a-0010 32.195000 36.258375 uh the times have changed uh mo[re]- to the more equitable at least
sw2732B-ms98-a-0011 36.258375 40.023250 [silence]
sw2732B-ms98-a-0012 40.023250 44.287875 uh yeah i think they have too i don't think women's rights have come as far
sw2732B-ms98-a-0013 44.287875 49.757625 uh i- i think that uh in general women would feel like they still sort of getting the bum deal
sw2732B-ms98-a-0014 49.757625 53.056875 compared to uh say some of the minority groups
sw2732B-ms98-a-0015 53.056875 56.954500 uh i know my wife would [laughter]
sw2732B-ms98-a-0016 56.954500 64.030250 yeah but uh i don't know uh seems like we come uh a long ways in terms of [vocalized-noise] the economies of of things uh
sw2732B-ms98-a-0017 64.030250 71.573250 if i recall back in the sixties we didn't tend to run a debt all the time but we did run a debt a lot with the great society a lot seventies and so forth
sw2732B-ms98-a-0018 71.573250 77.844875 and then uh it looked like we just stayed in some sort of a e[conomic]- e[conomic]- economic morass ever since
sw2732B-ms98-a-0019 77.844875 83.415125 [silence]
sw2732B-ms98-a-0020 83.415125 85.103250 hello we're there
sw2732B-ms98-a-0021 85.103250 90.104375 [silence]
sw2732B-ms98-a-0022 90.104375 91.770625 right i can rem[ember]-
sw2732B-ms98-a-0023 91.770625 98.500000 yeah i can remember in the late sixties early seventies you couldn't even uh hardly find a Japanese car around
sw2732B-ms98-a-0024 98.500000 103.913000 and uh what few there were around were very ugly looking things must've been
sw2732B-ms98-a-0025 103.913000 112.978000 yeah yeah they must've been pretty reliable though because some of them_1 they built up a fairly good following and it appears that's the case do you own any kind of foreign car
sw2732B-ms98-a-0026 112.978000 114.545750 [silence]
sw2732B-ms98-a-0027 114.545750 121.871750 i don't either i've always just uh i don't know whether you call it buy American it's just that i've always bought Fords and i guess i'll just keep buying [laughter-Fords]
sw2732B-ms98-a-0028 121.871750 124.050875 [laughter]
sw2732B-ms98-a-0029 124.050875 125.168750 uh but
sw2732B-ms98-a-0030 125.168750 131.827375 [silence]
sw2732B-ms98-a-0031 131.827375 132.981375 well
sw2732B-ms98-a-0032 132.981375 137.617250 [silence]
sw2732B-ms98-a-0033 137.617250 142.874750 some of the ethical aspects of political life certainly seem to have gone downhill and certain
sw2732B-ms98-a-0034 142.874750 144.377125 [silence]
sw2732B-ms98-a-0035 144.377125 147.862500 yeah in certain respects i feel like that the uh
sw2732B-ms98-a-0036 147.862500 154.822625 uh Reagan administration coming right off the Carter administration did tend to bring back a more aggressive uh
sw2732B-ms98-a-0037 154.822625 167.311125 uh aspect to the human rights issues and the sort of things that democracy in this country has really stood for and and you know and uh brought it back to the limelight compared to the sixties and seventies
sw2732B-ms98-a-0038 167.311125 172.230000 and i think that was a positive uh positive thing but it seems like uh
sw2732B-ms98-a-0039 172.230000 181.772375 uh with all that uh we never seem to be able to get our house in order when it comes to the economic things i- i bring this back to that at least uh it seems like we still continue to run uh
sw2732B-ms98-a-0040 181.772375 188.240750 uh heavy uh in[debted]- indebted budgets and the like i don't see any real way out of it either i might add
sw2732B-ms98-a-0041 188.240750 189.942750 [silence]
sw2732B-ms98-a-0042 189.942750 191.227625 yeah well
sw2732B-ms98-a-0043 191.227625 192.416625 [silence]
sw2732B-ms98-a-0044 192.416625 194.671250 yeah yeah i think that's true
sw2732B-ms98-a-0045 194.671250 202.109375 [silence]
sw2732B-ms98-a-0046 202.109375 208.507875 yeah i think they have too seems like that uh the country's mi[ght]- been more uh migratory
sw2732B-ms98-a-0047 208.507875 221.652125 and fam[ily]- the the old family structure of the mothers and the grandmothers and the grandfathers maybe even some great grandparents occasionally that seems to have been broken apart pretty pretty well including the family structure as a unit itself
sw2732B-ms98-a-0048 221.652125 225.962500 [silence]
sw2732B-ms98-a-0049 225.962500 236.134250 yeah well i hope that's not right i do i do hear these statistics same as you do and uh and uh i- i- i always felt like at least the immediate family unit mother father and children
sw2732B-ms98-a-0050 236.134250 241.864000 was a cohesive structure that was healthy and was a integral part of what made this country
sw2732B-ms98-a-0051 241.864000 251.850250 i don't know sort of a stable country in terms of discipline uh uh i don't know some not necessary discipline but cert[ain]- social order that's it and i- i
sw2732B-ms98-a-0052 251.850250 257.192125 [silence]
sw2732B-ms98-a-0053 257.192125 259.184500 yeah yeah yeah
sw2732B-ms98-a-0054 259.184500 260.684000 [silence]
sw2732B-ms98-a-0055 260.684000 267.835125 yeah in my my family i know most of us are Southerners just happen to be living up in Maryland though but my family uh we're
sw2732B-ms98-a-0056 267.835125 272.639000 we sort of like our roots and like to get back and have family reunions and all that
sw2732B-ms98-a-0057 272.639000 279.457750 and i think that may not be the norm for s[ome]- a lot of people as much as it is for us that don't want to do that
sw2732B-ms98-a-0058 279.457750 286.503375 [silence]
sw2732B-ms98-a-0059 286.503375 288.056500 yeah yeah
sw2732B-ms98-a-0060 288.056500 290.367125 [silence]
sw2732B-ms98-a-0061 290.367125 291.321250 yeah
sw2732B-ms98-a-0062 291.321250 298.442500 i must say too it seems like the whole flavor of uh war has changed considerably when you look at back at the Vietnam era
sw2732B-ms98-a-0063 298.442500 306.882250 and what all we went through there in terms of what's happened in the Iraqi situation it seems like uh we have uh made uh uh uh a a rather
sw2732B-ms98-a-0064 306.882250 317.019875 uh major about face in terms of the way we conduct war and the way we we uh can technologically uh uh carry out a war
sw2732B-ms98-a-0065 317.019875 319.707250 [silence]
sw2732B-ms98-a-0066 319.707250 321.716875 [laughter]
sw2732B-ms98-a-0067 321.716875 324.787625 they're a little hard to hide in that desert [laughter]
sw2732B-ms98-a-0068 324.787625 334.925375 well uh then too i think the philosophy is changed i was just reading tonight in the one of the news magazines that you can take you know i- i- i take Newsweek Time and US News and Wor[ld]- World Report all three as a matter of fact
sw2732B-ms98-a-0069 334.925375 341.152375 and uh i was just reading in one of the uh the those news magazines that uh there's a um
sw2732B-ms98-a-0070 341.152375 348.206375 a movement among certain members of the military establishment the upper hierarchy uh uh uh officer staff
sw2732B-ms98-a-0071 348.206375 361.542750 to uh change the kind of way we conducted war in the past in terms of uh instead of meeting the en[emy]- the enemy sort of head on instead of doing more feinting and and and and technologically appropriate tactics like these smart bombs and things like that doing more
sw2732B-ms98-a-0072 361.542750 372.216750 more smart things that are very damaging getting in getting out uh making end runs allowing more creativity at the lower echelon levels for people to slip in slip out and do things
sw2732B-ms98-a-0073 372.216750 381.931375 than uh has been the case in the past where the idea was to meet your enemy sort of head on and the like and i think politically we've changed a lot i think in the Vietnam war
sw2732B-ms98-a-0074 381.931375 387.107625 uh we we Congress got too much involved in in trying to manage the war
sw2732B-ms98-a-0075 387.107625 388.531125 [silence]
sw2732B-ms98-a-0076 388.531125 402.000875 yeah and that that's absolutely the wrong way to to go to conduct a war in my opinion when you when you're in a war right or wrong you should let the military establishment handle it and and and give them the job that they're paid and supposedly skilled at doing
sw2732B-ms98-a-0077 402.000875 409.486250 and let them get on with it instead of tying their hands which i felt like was not the case in the Vietnam war but was entirely the opposite in the case of the Iraqi war
sw2732B-ms98-a-0078 409.486250 416.227250 where they more or less gave it to Schwartzkopf and and the rest of the military units and just says hey look handle it and they did
sw2732B-ms98-a-0079 416.227250 426.531250 and i think the military proved itself competent to do exactly what it's paid to do and uh it just goes to give me a a a feeling that uh we did some things wrong
sw2732B-ms98-a-0080 426.531250 432.052375 i think in the Vietnam era uh and that uh Congress should have stayed out of it much as possible
sw2732B-ms98-a-0081 432.052375 443.850750 but uh that i see as a change and then industrially going back uh i- i think uh uh industrially we've changed i think we've come through an era of the last thirty years or so twenty ten of a uh a
sw2732B-ms98-a-0082 443.850750 454.219250 a nation that was industrially oriented towards uh manufacturing type industries and i think now we seeing ourselves transitioning into a more technological electronics age where it's
sw2732B-ms98-a-0083 454.219250 460.511500 information and communication and and computers that is really our next industrial revolution
sw2732B-ms98-a-0084 460.511500 474.813750 and uh you know it wouldn't surprise me the least little bit if we didn't see the whole idea of manufacture of automobiles and the like except to some degree we have to keep a little bit of expertise in the house that being a base export to third world countries and you may f[ind]- might find even Japan and
sw2732B-ms98-a-0085 474.813750 483.825125 and uh uh major powers like uh the the British and the central European economies being less and less dependent upon that kind of industry
sw2732B-ms98-a-0086 483.825125 492.138750 uh because it's uh somewhat labor intensive even if they start robotizing it uh i- i- i i'm concerned that that would be the case instead the more
sw2732B-ms98-a-0087 492.138750 501.838375 uh advanced nations would tend to get more computerized more telecommunication oriented and the like and information is is getting to be uh sort of the thing
sw2732B-ms98-a-0088 501.838375 504.267375 i- i- i think i don't know [laughter]
sw2732B-ms98-a-0089 504.267375 511.987250 [silence]
sw2732B-ms98-a-0090 511.987250 522.464500 um-hum yeah i- i think i- i- i- i think we're made some mistakes too for ex[ample]- i think the education system in this country has not really kept abreast of what's going on industrially
sw2732B-ms98-a-0091 522.464500 531.940625 and uh i'll give you an example i was talking about i've said for years because_1 i- i my background's in physics and uh i've said for years that the education system in this country has not reacted
sw2732B-ms98-a-0092 531.940625 542.014500 to what is the actual uh uh uh industrial evolutionary state of the country and by that i mean when i was going to school you got your basic sciences
sw2732B-ms98-a-0093 542.014500 545.026000 and uh that was pretty much about it
sw2732B-ms98-a-0094 545.026000 559.383125 and uh when i got out of school i had to sort of teach myself everything i've learned uh about computers and programming and and just you know the whole bit hardware in general relative to why you can do things with data acquisition process and the like
sw2732B-ms98-a-0095 559.383125 568.385000 and uh when i was going to school you had to have mathematics if you were in engineering or science or any of the other scientific fields chemistry and biology and the like
sw2732B-ms98-a-0096 568.385000 576.959875 but you never had to have computers and even to this date in colleges it's not required to take computer courses if you're in in the engineering or the science fields
sw2732B-ms98-a-0097 576.959875 589.234500 unless you're a computer scientist or or or someone in that area and then it is required of course because it's part of the curriculum and uh just as we have to take at least a year of English in in in colleges and a year of some sort of social study
sw2732B-ms98-a-0098 589.234500 599.785875 i think that it should be required in college in a in a uh uh science curriculum i even think in liberal arts this day and time it should be required you have to have a year of some sort of co[mputer]-
