sw2702A-ms98-a-0043 191.211125 198.108375 but that that just does not make it as an only car it's uh it's like i b[ought]- i would i bought a set of stereo speakers
sw2702A-ms98-a-0044 198.108375 202.850500 and it was one of those cash and carry deals and i had to take them_1 one at a time with the top down
sw2702A-ms98-a-0045 202.850500 208.834625 and it was winter so i was like in this coat with the top down and the speaker in the passenger seat
sw2702A-ms98-a-0046 208.834625 213.833625 and i drove that one home and then i went back and got the other one and put that in the passenger seat and drove that one home
