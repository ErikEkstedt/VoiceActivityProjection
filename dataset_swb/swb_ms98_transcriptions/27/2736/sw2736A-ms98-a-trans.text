sw2736A-ms98-a-0002 5.984500 14.025250 actually i'm real close to being in the market to buy a car i've got uh a couple older cars they're both over ten years old
sw2736A-ms98-a-0003 14.025250 17.104375 and uh they've served me well
sw2736A-ms98-a-0004 17.104375 24.571375 but i kind of would like to get a more uh gas efficient car and a newer model something looks a little nicer
sw2736A-ms98-a-0005 24.571375 30.331625 uh i've got three children at home two [vocalized-noise] fourteen year olds and a twelve year old
sw2736A-ms98-a-0006 30.331625 34.080875 and so i need to make sure i've got one that i can fit
sw2736A-ms98-a-0007 34.080875 42.067375 all five of us into and if you if you know anything about teenagers it's kind of hard to get them to sit together for any amount of time
sw2736A-ms98-a-0008 42.067375 44.343000 [silence]
sw2736A-ms98-a-0009 44.343000 46.371000 [laughter]
sw2736A-ms98-a-0010 46.371000 48.120500 [silence]
sw2736A-ms98-a-0011 48.120500 52.365625 well uh i've kind of been leaning towards a Caravan
sw2736A-ms98-a-0012 52.365625 58.325875 uh now i know that that uh they've gotten quite pricey in the last couple of years
sw2736A-ms98-a-0013 58.325875 61.415750 but uh i like the Dodge products
sw2736A-ms98-a-0014 61.415750 66.998250 and uh been uh couple times i've had a opportunity to rent one
sw2736A-ms98-a-0015 66.998250 72.890875 uh i've been really pleased with its performance and with the size
sw2736A-ms98-a-0016 72.890875 78.592875 and because if you get the seven passenger version [laughter] you can put some space between the kids
sw2736A-ms98-a-0017 78.592875 79.360750 [noise]
sw2736A-ms98-a-0018 79.360750 88.552875 and uh i think that would that would serve us well plus it's got uh good storage capacity in it for you know taking things along going to the store
sw2736A-ms98-a-0019 88.552875 93.669500 [silence]
sw2736A-ms98-a-0020 93.669500 96.757250 um-hum exactly correct
sw2736A-ms98-a-0021 96.757250 98.474750 yeah if you want
sw2736A-ms98-a-0022 98.474750 99.617875 [silence]
sw2736A-ms98-a-0023 99.617875 100.495500 yes
sw2736A-ms98-a-0024 100.495500 103.692000 yeah it uh the Dodge Caravans will do that
sw2736A-ms98-a-0025 103.692000 112.094500 uh you can take the uh uh usually there's a uh a double seat behind the uh front buckets
sw2736A-ms98-a-0026 112.094500 121.168625 and then if you get the and then there's a three seat that goes or three person seat that goes in the back now what you can do is you could take that middle seat out
sw2736A-ms98-a-0027 121.168625 132.607125 and just have the three seats in the back and the two seats up front or you can take the uh three seat out and just use the two seat or you can take the two seat and move the two seat to the back
sw2736A-ms98-a-0028 132.607125 140.709375 so it's very versatile you can move the seats all around that's the only thing you can't do is take that three person across seat and move it forward
sw2736A-ms98-a-0029 140.709375 160.089750 [silence]
sw2736A-ms98-a-0030 160.089750 161.222250 uh-huh

sw2736A-ms98-a-0038 218.880500 224.538125 yeah i think that's getting to be kind of important now that uh you know the price is becoming
sw2736A-ms98-a-0039 224.538125 233.698625 the driving factor and then you look at once you realize how much money you've got to spend then you start looking around at at what you can buy with it where before i think you
sw2736A-ms98-a-0040 233.698625 237.701000 you looked at the car you wanted and then you looked to see how well you could afford it
sw2736A-ms98-a-0041 237.701000 239.493500 [laughter]
sw2736A-ms98-a-0042 239.493500 240.753125 or how you could afford it
sw2736A-ms98-a-0043 240.753125 249.255125 [silence]
sw2736A-ms98-a-0044 249.255125 250.461500 yeah

sw2736A-ms98-a-0046 254.565500 259.518500 yeah i know they're trying to do everything they can to uh end the recession
sw2736A-ms98-a-0047 259.518500 265.435125 and dropping the prime is probably one of the things i just bought a new house so [noise]
sw2736A-ms98-a-0048 265.435125 269.457125 i got a a uh nine and a half percent interest rate
sw2736A-ms98-a-0049 269.457125 272.357500 not sure i could do much better today
sw2736A-ms98-a-0050 272.357500 277.783250 but uh that is also effecting buying a new car
sw2736A-ms98-a-0051 277.783250 279.379000 [laughter]
sw2736A-ms98-a-0052 279.379000 282.791000 [silence]

sw2736A-ms98-a-0055 291.865375 296.527500 uh two fourteen year olds will be uh fifteen on the fourth of July
sw2736A-ms98-a-0056 296.527500 298.608250 so
sw2736A-ms98-a-0057 298.608250 302.668250 yeah they're twins born on the bicentennial
sw2736A-ms98-a-0058 302.668250 308.277625 you're going to have twins have them on the bicentennial is our motto July fourth seventy six
sw2736A-ms98-a-0059 308.277625 315.183875 so uh uh i've still got another full year and three months before they're going to be
sw2736A-ms98-a-0060 315.183875 320.261250 behind the wheel of a car so America's safe for another fifteen month
sw2736A-ms98-a-0061 320.261250 322.125500 and uh after that
sw2736A-ms98-a-0062 322.125500 330.347250 now i may keep the uh one or both of the two cars i i currently have for them to drive you know they're they're
sw2736A-ms98-a-0063 330.347250 339.784000 they're small enough that a first time driver could handle it yet big enough that i feel s[afe]- feel safe that if they were in an accident they would survive
sw2736A-ms98-a-0064 339.784000 344.812125 you know what i mean it i don't get that kind of feeling with the kind of car like you talked about the Honda
sw2736A-ms98-a-0065 344.812125 346.635125 they're just
sw2736A-ms98-a-0066 346.635125 348.336125 [silence]

sw2736A-ms98-a-0080 398.979250 405.463500 the thing is that they're i think it's a two part seat belt though there's the uh door belt and then there's one a lap belt

sw2736A-ms98-a-0088 451.958625 454.543250 yeah the uh the supports
sw2736A-ms98-a-0089 454.543250 461.156000 um a good source of information i've found has always been these uh used car manuals
sw2736A-ms98-a-0090 461.156000 467.294875 because you can flip through the used car manuals and they'll give you a list of all the problems that the car's had in the past
sw2736A-ms98-a-0091 467.294875 481.100500 and you can look at the uh the track record on a car over the year and you usually notice uh a lot of problems at the beginning and then things kind of iron out to where there's fewer problems and you get an idea on how well
sw2736A-ms98-a-0092 481.100500 492.540625 the the next car's going to be now as long as they aren't changing the model you know like when the uh Pontiac Grand Prix went from being a huge car to a small car they had a lot of problems with the smaller car as long as they aren't
sw2736A-ms98-a-0093 492.540625 503.369125 [silence]

sw2736A-ms98-a-0099 521.171250 525.333625 yeah i remember when that happened so unless they're really changing the model
sw2736A-ms98-a-0100 525.333625 526.795625 um
sw2736A-ms98-a-0101 526.795625 533.175000 yeah chances are that it's probably going to have the the fewer mistakes than it had the year before
