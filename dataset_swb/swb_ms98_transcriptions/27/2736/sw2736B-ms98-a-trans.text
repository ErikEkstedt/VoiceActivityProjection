sw2736B-ms98-a-0038 144.555750 147.247000 if it's the Toyota or
sw2736B-ms98-a-0039 147.247000 155.380500 or one of the other ones i don't know if it's one of the Americans or the import ones where uh they actually have like um
sw2736B-ms98-a-0040 155.380500 160.861375 some bucket seats in the back but you can actually pull them out i mean they're really easy to pull out
sw2736B-ms98-a-0041 160.861375 167.112125 um and you can uh move them around and stuff and it it to me
sw2736B-ms98-a-0042 167.112125 180.212375 th[at]- that would be real good for us uh my husband and i uh like to go camping and stuff and right now we have a van which is it's an older van and we're we're thinking about buying another sedan
sw2736B-ms98-a-0043 180.212375 183.227125 um probably next year
sw2736B-ms98-a-0044 183.227125 190.393375 um right now motorcycles is takes precedence since that that's what my husband really wants right now
sw2736B-ms98-a-0045 190.393375 196.316875 but uh next year we'll probably buy a new car and we're looking at uh possibly the Honda Accord
sw2736B-ms98-a-0046 196.316875 198.093750 um
sw2736B-ms98-a-0047 198.093750 200.926750 that's kind of uh
sw2736B-ms98-a-0048 200.926750 201.942625 [silence]
sw2736B-ms98-a-0049 201.942625 209.024125 as far as far as the interior it's got the luxury interior but d[oesn't]- it doesn't really have the luxury price tag that a lot of the other cars have
sw2736B-ms98-a-0050 209.024125 218.490375 which is one of the things that we were looking at you know finding something that's that's fairly affordable but yet has all the nice luxury items that we want
sw2736B-ms98-a-0051 218.490375 226.139125 [silence]
sw2736B-ms98-a-0052 226.139125 226.886000 yeah

sw2736B-ms98-a-0056 239.687875 245.289375 yeah well i think it's going to be a lot easier now i just heard that they [vocalized-noise] lowered the prime lending rate
sw2736B-ms98-a-0057 245.289375 250.766375 so i think it's going to be a lot easier to to be able to get a car now and finance it
sw2736B-ms98-a-0058 250.766375 254.495625 i think banks are going to be a lot more a little bit more lenient
sw2736B-ms98-a-0059 254.495625 258.851625 [silence]
sw2736B-ms98-a-0060 258.851625 259.959000 yeah

sw2736B-ms98-a-0064 278.152250 291.885750 yeah i can imagine you got to kind of work work that into your budget tha[t]- balance that and the house payment and of course uh is if you buy a new car you're going to are any of your kids driving age yet
sw2736B-ms98-a-0065 291.885750 297.493250 [silence]

sw2736B-ms98-a-0070 305.966750 308.470125 [laughter]

sw2736B-ms98-a-0076 339.386750 340.313875 uh-huh
sw2736B-ms98-a-0077 340.313875 345.405875 [silence]
sw2736B-ms98-a-0078 345.405875 356.573500 well the the Honda's have been have been very safe in in accidents uh more so than a lot of the American cars as a matter of fact i just heard something today on on the news about
sw2736B-ms98-a-0079 356.573500 364.298875 those uh automatic seat belts that are attached to the door um they're questioning the safety of those now
sw2736B-ms98-a-0080 364.298875 375.027625 saying that and they showed uh a simulation where there w[ere]- they had a dummy in the car and the door opened and the dummy actually fell out of the car and the car rolled out on top of him
sw2736B-ms98-a-0081 375.027625 376.041750 [silence]
sw2736B-ms98-a-0082 376.041750 385.164500 so they're saying they're not as safe as they give the appearance of being safe but they're really not as safe as they as they uh appear to be
sw2736B-ms98-a-0083 385.164500 387.207625 so um
sw2736B-ms98-a-0084 387.207625 391.819500 i'm kind of concerned about that as far as you know wh[at]- the seat belts
sw2736B-ms98-a-0085 391.819500 399.095750 uh i don't know if Maryland has a uh a seat belt law but they do have one in Texas and you're you're required to wear them
sw2736B-ms98-a-0086 399.095750 403.745250 [silence]
sw2736B-ms98-a-0087 403.745250 406.322375 exactly but
sw2736B-ms98-a-0088 406.322375 414.818000 ninety uh probably about well i don't know about ninety but probably fifty percent of the people that have those probably don't wear the lap portion of it
sw2736B-ms98-a-0089 414.818000 418.107875 i know my brother doesn't and he has one in his car
sw2736B-ms98-a-0090 418.107875 419.119875 [silence]
sw2736B-ms98-a-0091 419.119875 420.993500 [laughter]
sw2736B-ms98-a-0092 420.993500 426.492375 so i mean it it kind of gives you a false sense of security you think oh i've got one portion of my seat belt on
sw2736B-ms98-a-0093 426.492375 429.736875 um but if your door comes open
sw2736B-ms98-a-0094 429.736875 432.589750 you know it's not going to do you any good
sw2736B-ms98-a-0095 432.589750 440.704625 so that that that's a concern of mine as far as uh what i'll be looking at w[ith]- with buying a new car um
sw2736B-ms98-a-0096 440.704625 452.584125 i'm not really sure if i would want the seat belts attached to the door i think i would feel better with them attached to the actual car the inside where they're normally attached to like behind the door
sw2736B-ms98-a-0097 452.584125 460.618250 [silence]
sw2736B-ms98-a-0098 460.618250 461.863250 uh-huh

sw2736B-ms98-a-0104 476.575875 478.499750 yeah yeah
sw2736B-ms98-a-0105 478.499750 489.647000 [silence]
sw2736B-ms98-a-0106 489.647000 491.024375 yeah
sw2736B-ms98-a-0107 491.024375 498.177500 yeah the the Le Mans is like that too uh we used to have a Le Mans when i was in in high school
sw2736B-ms98-a-0108 498.177500 503.900750 um and it was a big car i mean it was like the uh the Grand Prix
sw2736B-ms98-a-0109 503.900750 508.877750 and in i think around nineteen eighty um
sw2736B-ms98-a-0110 508.877750 512.915625 they changed the model and it like wen[t]- went to half the size
sw2736B-ms98-a-0111 512.915625 520.305500 literally i mean it got chopped in half and it wasn't even the same car anymore didn't even remotely resemble the old car
sw2736B-ms98-a-0112 520.305500 532.035625 [silence]
sw2736B-ms98-a-0113 532.035625 540.495000 yeah well everybody that i've talked to who's ever had a Honda loves them and my husband had a Honda
sw2736B-ms98-a-0114 540.495000 547.034375 uh and it was a lease car and he had to turn back in uh a year and a half ago
sw2736B-ms98-a-0115 547.034375 553.417625 uh and he had it for four years and never had a single problem with it and it was great
sw2736B-ms98-a-0116 553.417625 557.908875 um and the only reason why we ended up not buying it was because
sw2736B-ms98-a-0117 557.908875 558.936000 [silence]
sw2736B-ms98-a-0118 558.936000 570.653000 we didn't feel the at at the time the residual was like sixty five hundred dollars and it was a four year old car with seventy thousand miles on it and we thought that was a little bit too much to pay for
sw2736B-ms98-a-0119 570.653000 572.995625 um a four year old car
sw2736B-ms98-a-0120 572.995625 574.069125 [silence]
sw2736B-ms98-a-0121 574.069125 575.611000 so
sw2736B-ms98-a-0122 575.611000 581.607875 so we ended up just went just went ahead and just turned the keys back in and and got out of the lease
sw2736B-ms98-a-0123 581.607875 583.199250 um
sw2736B-ms98-a-0124 583.199250 584.559250 [silence]
sw2736B-ms98-a-0125 584.559250 597.558500 one thing that i that i am curious about is um reading information on air bags do some of the vans i think i don't know about the Dodge Caravan but some of the vans n[ow]- now have um driver side air bags 
sw2736B-ms98-a-0126 597.558500 599.888000 which i think is a good idea
