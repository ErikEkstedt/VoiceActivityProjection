sw2707B-ms98-a-0005 6.673500 8.191625 oh okay

sw2707B-ms98-a-0007 9.650000 11.041875 oh yeah
sw2707B-ms98-a-0008 11.041875 19.457000 [silence]
sw2707B-ms98-a-0009 19.457000 25.851875 oh you're you're you're not the so-called ex[pert]- you need a house i guess to go through all of that i have had a couple of houses and uh
sw2707B-ms98-a-0010 25.851875 35.070375 uh the only recommendation i would have for someone who hasn't gardened is uh one get a couple of good books of books of course and usually they have talk shows here in Dallas they have
sw2707B-ms98-a-0011 35.070375 44.352875 two great uh talk shows that go through everything that will grow here which is the opposite probably of what would grow up where you are you know so
sw2707B-ms98-a-0012 44.352875 58.602875 uh in fact you you could easily do that now listen to turn on a talk show up there and see if there there's got to be some gardening folks on the radio that says when to put your grass in and and what kind of grass to grow up in Virginia and everything so i uh
sw2707B-ms98-a-0013 58.602875 63.906625 for someone who doesn't garden i'd say that that's my biggest recommendation is to
sw2707B-ms98-a-0014 63.906625 67.659375 oh yeah yeah i like it a lot uh
sw2707B-ms98-a-0015 67.659375 74.950000 uh it's a lot of work i'm an engineer i'm i'm with TI you are you with TI up there or okay
sw2707B-ms98-a-0016 74.950000 76.246125 okay
sw2707B-ms98-a-0017 76.246125 77.739875 um
sw2707B-ms98-a-0018 77.739875 78.885500 [silence]
sw2707B-ms98-a-0019 78.885500 87.803875 where was oh yeah no i- i like it i uh i always know that why i'm not a farmer when i garden though i mean it is dog work and it is tough
sw2707B-ms98-a-0020 87.803875 91.617000 i have a lot of trees down here uh
sw2707B-ms98-a-0021 91.617000 94.982250 the part i don't like i guess would be from December
sw2707B-ms98-a-0022 94.982250 98.966000 through February where you have to rake leaves
sw2707B-ms98-a-0023 98.966000 104.406375 forever it seems like and the wind blows all the leaves on from your neighbor after you rake yours so
sw2707B-ms98-a-0024 104.406375 109.539125 other than that you know those three months when it's pure dog work
sw2707B-ms98-a-0025 109.539125 119.719750 uh the rest of it's very enjoyable just going through the experiences of of putting little plants in or whatever i- i haven't had to plant any trees because i've got so many but uh
sw2707B-ms98-a-0026 119.719750 124.265375 uh but i do listen to that talk show there there is some great people from Texas A&M i don't know
sw2707B-ms98-a-0027 124.265375 128.705625 uh maybe you've heard of A&M down here but there's some great uh folks uh
sw2707B-ms98-a-0028 128.705625 132.462125 that have been well trained and again uh to
sw2707B-ms98-a-0029 132.462125 135.657625 to uh recommend gardening for this area
sw2707B-ms98-a-0030 135.657625 146.520000 [silence]
sw2707B-ms98-a-0031 146.520000 151.409625 yeah you probably have rye grass up there we grow bermuda and Saint Augustine here
sw2707B-ms98-a-0032 151.409625 155.947000 right yeah see you would have to learn that though see [laughter]
sw2707B-ms98-a-0033 155.947000 157.201625 [laughter]

sw2707B-ms98-a-0036 162.640000 169.379375 do you have much luck in the Winter don't they they're freeze it freeze out because the roots are all in the Winter uh or do you have to start all over every year
sw2707B-ms98-a-0037 169.379375 170.723500 right yeah
sw2707B-ms98-a-0038 170.723500 174.470375 [silence]
sw2707B-ms98-a-0039 174.470375 175.485625 um-hum

sw2707B-ms98-a-0041 179.463875 181.639625 in the same pot that's that's amazing

sw2707B-ms98-a-0043 182.910875 183.837000 um-hum

sw2707B-ms98-a-0046 191.202875 192.409500 [silence]
sw2707B-ms98-a-0047 192.409500 195.351375 i grow a few things in pots but we have to bring them in here
sw2707B-ms98-a-0048 195.351375 197.808375 in the Winter because usually
sw2707B-ms98-a-0049 197.808375 206.365000 uh if it's not below the ground so you can insulate the roots from freezing you know the pots will uh will die everything in a pot will die
sw2707B-ms98-a-0050 206.365000 209.872750 so you can bring them well we do bring stuff in the garage and everything
sw2707B-ms98-a-0051 209.872750 218.853000 but uh it's quite time consuming by the way i don't know how close you are to getting a house or anything but it's quite uh but i would definitely do it
sw2707B-ms98-a-0052 218.853000 224.626125 i'm all for doing everything whether whatever subject you pick uh do it the knowledgeable way
sw2707B-ms98-a-0053 224.626125 227.468000 don't go out there and start digging holes uh
sw2707B-ms98-a-0054 227.468000 231.084000 get some books of whether it be Pennsylvania or Virginia
sw2707B-ms98-a-0055 231.084000 235.657625 as as well as uh not your neighbors of course they usually know nothing but uh
sw2707B-ms98-a-0056 235.657625 241.481250 uh listen to still then there's always a gardening part of the newspaper for communications
sw2707B-ms98-a-0057 241.481250 252.260375 as well as i bet there's a talk show up there right now that you if you turn the dial around you'll on Saturday this is Saturday that you'll find someone probably in the morning i don't know
sw2707B-ms98-a-0058 252.260375 259.124000 discussing you know what we do up in Virginia to get something growing you probably don't have to do much over there the soil's probably so good
sw2707B-ms98-a-0059 259.124000 261.999750 our soil's not very good down here we're
sw2707B-ms98-a-0060 261.999750 266.409250 i guess in the ice age it it it's pushed a lot of uh
sw2707B-ms98-a-0061 266.409250 267.469125 [silence]
sw2707B-ms98-a-0062 267.469125 274.248500 limestone and everything some parts of Dallas you just can dig a foot down and you hit solid limestone you know
sw2707B-ms98-a-0063 274.248500 281.671625 so uh i think all the trees that are here now were planted kind of like the Johnny Appleseed type trees
sw2707B-ms98-a-0064 281.671625 288.348375 where people have come from i'm sure when the Indians were here there was nothing growing in this part of of Dallas it's so scrubby
sw2707B-ms98-a-0065 288.348375 289.879625 uh
sw2707B-ms98-a-0066 289.879625 297.550750 and i think that we even got our famous hundred year old uh pecan trees from Alabama and all that too
sw2707B-ms98-a-0067 297.550750 301.505500 we we call them native pecan trees but they grow wild here
sw2707B-ms98-a-0068 301.505500 306.876375 they're eating pecans though pecans are probably not taken from Virginia they're probably only in the South
sw2707B-ms98-a-0069 306.876375 309.066250 for pecan pie and all that
sw2707B-ms98-a-0070 309.066250 312.640500 it's what they call pecan pecan pie up there in in the East
sw2707B-ms98-a-0071 312.640500 315.785000 i'm from Pennsylvania and New Jersey i'm from New Jersey originally
sw2707B-ms98-a-0072 315.785000 316.770125 [silence]
sw2707B-ms98-a-0073 316.770125 319.733500 i've worked on that [laughter]
sw2707B-ms98-a-0074 319.733500 321.850000 with some chewing gum which i shouldn't do
sw2707B-ms98-a-0075 321.850000 323.014250 um
sw2707B-ms98-a-0076 323.014250 324.094875 [silence]
sw2707B-ms98-a-0077 324.094875 328.610000 go ahead you wha[t]- how many times you called by the way or how many times have you been called
sw2707B-ms98-a-0078 328.610000 338.688875 [silence]
sw2707B-ms98-a-0079 338.688875 339.844750 um-hum

sw2707B-ms98-a-0081 345.290000 354.432125 oh yeah today that's what i'm saying today i was i got to laugh because i tried it this morning and uh i thought everybody was gardening i thought well no no this is a great subject because they're out there gardening you know
sw2707B-ms98-a-0082 354.432125 358.194500 i didn't tell you what our weather is like it is beautiful here today
sw2707B-ms98-a-0083 358.194500 359.830875 [silence]
sw2707B-ms98-a-0084 359.830875 364.095125 it's not quite that hot yeah we've had a real nice mild Spring uh
sw2707B-ms98-a-0085 364.095125 370.076500 you might have seen if you've seen the news today about all the tornados here that were north of us
sw2707B-ms98-a-0086 370.076500 376.070625 uh i don't know if you get CNN i don't get CNN but it's here at work in fact i'm at work today believe it or not
sw2707B-ms98-a-0087 376.070625 380.213125 but uh they have uh TV's in the break areas
sw2707B-ms98-a-0088 380.213125 387.079500 and there was some some heavy tornados uh i guess in Kansas quite a few people were killed you'll see that on the evening news
sw2707B-ms98-a-0089 387.079500 388.441625 uh
sw2707B-ms98-a-0090 388.441625 392.316625 tornados uh which is not the right subject but uh
sw2707B-ms98-a-0091 392.316625 400.828625 they blow through here all in the Spring i guess it's related somewhat to the weather you know and and the plants and all that that uh sometimes they do essentially nothing
sw2707B-ms98-a-0092 400.828625 408.995875 and the weather men yesterday were all alert say hey there's something really terrible going to happen and they they sure were right but it wasn't in Texas it was
sw2707B-ms98-a-0093 408.995875 415.880500 north of us yeah look at the news tonight they'll they'll they claim thirty odd people were killed up in Kansas City Kansas somewhere
sw2707B-ms98-a-0094 415.880500 417.996500 anyway back to planting
sw2707B-ms98-a-0095 417.996500 423.703250 uh i have never studied it is very interesting uh subject uh
sw2707B-ms98-a-0096 423.703250 429.793875 when you when did you get a house uh you your trees grow up so well up there but i'm sure you have plenty of trees
sw2707B-ms98-a-0097 429.793875 432.570375 that that is a key thing for shade
sw2707B-ms98-a-0098 432.570375 435.223000 and keeping your bills down uh
sw2707B-ms98-a-0099 435.223000 436.979375 [silence]
sw2707B-ms98-a-0100 436.979375 440.083250 i guess you have mostly pine trees but where in Virginia are you all
sw2707B-ms98-a-0101 440.083250 442.617250 [silence]
sw2707B-ms98-a-0102 442.617250 443.527125 um-hum

sw2707B-ms98-a-0104 446.528750 450.105125 oh do you have the cherry blossoms and everything there or not
sw2707B-ms98-a-0105 450.105125 455.601750 [silence]
sw2707B-ms98-a-0106 455.601750 456.740375 yeah

sw2707B-ms98-a-0108 458.694250 460.320125 oh yeah
sw2707B-ms98-a-0109 460.320125 465.060000 yeah azaleas grow all over we grow those here too although again we have to prepare the soil
sw2707B-ms98-a-0110 465.060000 469.440000 you probably have nice big pine you probably have all kinds of trees the oaks and everything that's one thing i noticed about
sw2707B-ms98-a-0111 469.440000 477.581000 [silence]
sw2707B-ms98-a-0112 477.581000 478.640000 um-hum
sw2707B-ms98-a-0113 478.640000 479.773625 [silence]
sw2707B-ms98-a-0114 479.773625 481.452375 have you ever been down here
sw2707B-ms98-a-0115 481.452375 483.069750 [silence]
sw2707B-ms98-a-0116 483.069750 486.133875 okay it's it's interesting country uh
sw2707B-ms98-a-0117 486.133875 489.111625 it is wide open uh and flat
sw2707B-ms98-a-0118 489.111625 500.215750 uh and again as i said i think the when the Indians were here there there weren't any trees but the the civilization has brought all kinds of experiments with all kinds of trees and uh
sw2707B-ms98-a-0119 500.215750 509.577625 a lot of them have done well uh they they do have some pine forest areas in wes[t]- in wes[t]- in east Texas where you have native pine trees but here in Dallas it's uh
sw2707B-ms98-a-0120 509.577625 514.531750 i think they all were planted by the classical Johnny Appleseed and uh
sw2707B-ms98-a-0121 514.531750 523.198875 uh Johnny Pecanseed whatever you would call it you know because there's a tremendous amount of pecan trees that we use for you know uh for eating
sw2707B-ms98-a-0122 523.198875 526.681500 i think they thought that was going to be a great boom crop uh
sw2707B-ms98-a-0123 526.681500 529.919625 hundred and fifty years ago because they are all over the place
sw2707B-ms98-a-0124 529.919625 531.482375 in the South
sw2707B-ms98-a-0125 531.482375 533.198000 [silence]
sw2707B-ms98-a-0126 533.198000 534.391500 what else
sw2707B-ms98-a-0127 534.391500 536.627875 [silence]
sw2707B-ms98-a-0128 536.627875 543.715250 how man[y]- how many subject i- i the subjects are usually pretty interesting i- i'm i'm of course i'm a TI'er so i'm hoping this works TI is very good uh
sw2707B-ms98-a-0129 543.715250 548.691125 has done a lot of experiments in the speech uh synthesis synthesis can't say it
sw2707B-ms98-a-0130 548.691125 559.226500 and they've come out with some new products uh some new in fact this week they came out with some new math uh you might see them in your advertisements uh new math uh Speak and Math uh
sw2707B-ms98-a-0131 559.226500 565.491125 uh devices they they have had Speak and Spell and all that for years but they've come out with some different ones
sw2707B-ms98-a-0132 565.491125 567.590250 this past week and uh
sw2707B-ms98-a-0133 567.590250 575.262000 my wife and everyone ask me wha[t]- what are they going to accomplish out of all this and i said well you're not going to have to type on the computer one day you're just going to have to talk to it
sw2707B-ms98-a-0134 575.262000 577.899500 you know so you it's going to be much faster
sw2707B-ms98-a-0135 577.899500 583.356000 of course you know the classical thing for the handicapped too person who can't type very fast or
sw2707B-ms98-a-0136 583.356000 584.990250 like i can of course
sw2707B-ms98-a-0137 584.990250 587.988625 uh not that i can talk very fast either but uh
