sw2701B-ms98-a-0065 256.797500 270.081875 um and also for the church to recognize it as a a true exorcism you know um usually they're such i think i really think that there's a fine line between what um
sw2701B-ms98-a-0066 270.081875 283.760000 you know a lot of people think is possessed and what are really mental disorders you know and maybe in the old days you know many years ago what they often said oh people were possessed we probably recognize now as schizophrenia or something
sw2701B-ms98-a-0067 283.760000 292.160125 um and uh you know it's it's it's hard to to say you know whether
sw2701B-ms98-a-0068 292.160125 298.367750 it's it's just a it's a mental disorder or it's really uh uh it's a or if it's a split personality or something

sw2701B-ms98-a-0075 321.660375 334.183000 and i was just the reason i asked that i was curious i thought maybe in different parts of uh you know the country maybe there were certain shows that were more more popular than in other parts
sw2701B-ms98-a-0076 334.183000 346.935000 and i know in this area it's i don't know DC is especially the newer areas are really known for having so many [laughter-yuppies] [laughter-you] [laughter-know] and a lot of them are into Thirty Something and you know

sw2701B-ms98-a-0078 356.668125 370.570250 yeah yeah and i just i was just wondering [laughter-demographically] if you know if different parts if there were shows that were more popular than in other areas i don't know like where you live um you know what are the real

sw2701B-ms98-a-0109 472.511125 483.777875 this show is based upon stories that actually happened at Wooton High [laughter-where] [laughter-he] [laughter-went] and that's and he sh[e]- denies some of it you know um i oh
