sw2701A-ms98-a-0039 169.142750 176.327625 you know i'm from you know i'm was raised Catholic fairly you know fair[ly]- fairly strong with my mom and dad so
sw2701A-ms98-a-0040 176.327625 190.037625 but it you know that's kind of interesting um but the bottom line it you know they did the exorcism it wasn't real major you know sh[e]- she was fairly you know sh[e]- you know obviously there she you know she something was wrong with her [laughter]
sw2701A-ms98-a-0041 190.037625 192.979875 but uh it wasn't really uh
sw2701A-ms98-a-0042 192.979875 196.167625 you know extraordinary as far as her actions
sw2701A-ms98-a-0043 196.167625 201.038625 and she had done that and she felt like that helped her
sw2701A-ms98-a-0044 201.038625 206.410000 but at the same time shortly after that exorcism they also started um
sw2701A-ms98-a-0045 206.410000 211.037375 uh giving her medication for like a split personality type s[tuff]- of
sw2701A-ms98-a-0046 211.037375 218.749750 so uh she's doing better but and and the girl herself you know believes that it you know that she was uh
sw2701A-ms98-a-0047 218.749750 223.422875 you know possessed but and you know it it's hard to say

sw2701A-ms98-a-0053 236.804500 242.156375 well i i can't say it wasn't just because of the fact that that it's pretty
sw2701A-ms98-a-0054 242.156375 253.250625 unusual for something like that to be nationally televised uh or or have anybody come in you know who who would want to have that televised you know if that was happening to your daughter

sw2701A-ms98-a-0084 385.740250 390.670875 you know some of the top sitcoms obviously do you know always in the top five you know
sw2701A-ms98-a-0085 390.670875 395.145875 the Cosby or i think A Different World is real strong and
sw2701A-ms98-a-0086 395.145875 396.562625 uh
sw2701A-ms98-a-0087 396.562625 398.396750 [silence]
sw2701A-ms98-a-0088 398.396750 407.525500 yeah well that's the one it's the one right after Cosby and it's produced by Cosby and it's about it's basically about uh college
sw2701A-ms98-a-0089 407.525500 408.694875 uh
sw2701A-ms98-a-0090 408.694875 415.262500 you know and it it obv[ious]- it's you know s[ince]- since it's kind of promoted by Cosby it's you know mostly blacks
sw2701A-ms98-a-0091 415.262500 419.005500 but uh but it's it's a pretty good show it uh
sw2701A-ms98-a-0092 419.005500 421.469125 have you ever heard of Jasmine Guy
sw2701A-ms98-a-0093 421.469125 422.500500 [silence]
sw2701A-ms98-a-0094 422.500500 427.241625 okay now she's one of the main stars of that and now she's just come out came out with an album
sw2701A-ms98-a-0095 427.241625 432.901625 and uh and which is fairly successful she's got one or two singles that have done very well so
sw2701A-ms98-a-0096 432.901625 437.800125 but she is a very strong personality in that show uh and uh
sw2701A-ms98-a-0097 437.800125 444.658375 it's your basic college and what people run into and th[ey]- in fact they just had a show covering AIDS [noise]
sw2701A-ms98-a-0098 444.658375 448.260000 so you know they try to get their messages across i should say
