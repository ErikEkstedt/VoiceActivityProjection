sw2723A-ms98-a-0019 68.426125 72.834125 uh i hope i never have to use them really per se although i've used medical a little bit uh
sw2723A-ms98-a-0020 72.834125 81.872625 that well that one certainly is high i i worry that it's weakening rather than strengthening so i like to reverse that trend and say i'd like to get those to strengthen you know be better and better
sw2723A-ms98-a-0021 81.872625 88.643375 then sal[ary]- sal[ary]- salary continuance i've never used that one i hope i never will but that's kind of like an insurance thing i sure like that one

sw2723A-ms98-a-0050 203.450000 207.781500 and i guess they've been using them for six months now and i've known several engineers that got laid off and they said
sw2723A-ms98-a-0051 207.781500 218.617500 it's like getting a PhD almost they the much they learn over there you know after they've been laid off uh one engineer said it was really an education he he just learned like you he said
sw2723A-ms98-a-0052 218.617500 223.604000 he learned a tremendous amount that he never would have able to pick up on his own he was very thankful for that too

sw2723A-ms98-a-0054 228.462875 230.255500 to have an office yeah

sw2723A-ms98-a-0056 231.317875 241.579375 yeah well he said he learned so much and how he thought he thought he had a PhD in how to get a job after he was through the whole process for for several months he did eventually get a job
sw2723A-ms98-a-0057 241.579375 245.587375 [silence]
sw2723A-ms98-a-0058 245.587375 250.457375 yeah apparently it's very sophisticated and i guess it may be one of the best uh that anyone's doing
sw2723A-ms98-a-0059 250.457375 257.017750 [silence]
sw2723A-ms98-a-0060 257.017750 259.790875 right you're absolutely right that's a good one
sw2723A-ms98-a-0061 259.790875 262.479000 what do you think about pensions anything on that or
sw2723A-ms98-a-0062 262.479000 265.993250 [silence]
sw2723A-ms98-a-0063 265.993250 267.276000 yeah

sw2723A-ms98-a-0069 277.188750 286.090000 what do you think of a pension that goes from one company to the other like an account like a 401[K]- account i i've been thinking about that for years uh
sw2723A-ms98-a-0070 286.090000 297.333000 i know that's what i'm saying that that pensions you see just like you were you're saying you've only got uh so many years say you work for two three companies if you take your pension with you after you're vested
sw2723A-ms98-a-0071 297.333000 301.610625 and then just add the money together like you do with a 401[K]- account you know
sw2723A-ms98-a-0072 301.610625 307.026250 uh it's your account period it doesn't matter where you go or anything that's your account to roll over
sw2723A-ms98-a-0073 307.026250 308.133000 [silence]
sw2723A-ms98-a-0074 308.133000 317.981000 no no there isn't i i'm saying that's the question what do you think could be better and i'm saying that pensions say in the year two thousand or more when social security goes away which it probably will
sw2723A-ms98-a-0075 317.981000 323.233125 i think they ought to have a pension at least that you'd never lose you work for a company seven years
sw2723A-ms98-a-0076 323.233125 325.736875 [silence]
sw2723A-ms98-a-0077 325.736875 335.003750 uh well social security's going to go to way i think and you can or you can invest your own money you have no control over your social security and it's not paid for by the current
sw2723A-ms98-a-0078 335.003750 338.996625 like when say we retire after the year two thousand
sw2723A-ms98-a-0079 338.996625 342.856000 social security's paid for by the twenty five year olds you know they may rebel
sw2723A-ms98-a-0080 342.856000 351.245375 and you won't have any social security where if your money was in your account i mean you can never lose it it's there you don't have to depend on anybody to be putting that money in for you you know
sw2723A-ms98-a-0081 351.245375 352.830250 that's just a thought i mean i
sw2723A-ms98-a-0082 352.830250 354.314750 if they say which
sw2723A-ms98-a-0083 354.314750 355.511375 yeah
sw2723A-ms98-a-0084 355.511375 356.930250 [silence]
sw2723A-ms98-a-0085 356.930250 365.622875 yeah and instead of having a a socialized pension it just would be really money that you and your company maybe you had to put some money in it too i don't really know
sw2723A-ms98-a-0086 365.622875 369.082250 but i i can see where they'd need to do something on that because
sw2723A-ms98-a-0087 369.082250 373.931750 the statistics are you don't work for a company twenty years through no fault of your own you know
sw2723A-ms98-a-0088 373.931750 378.158625 you work for five six seven and y[ou]- y[ou]- a lot of people i know guys
sw2723A-ms98-a-0089 378.158625 380.735625 [silence]
sw2723A-ms98-a-0090 380.735625 386.703625 yeah i have too but not not quite that often but uh yeah i've only got uh
sw2723A-ms98-a-0091 386.703625 391.230625 i've got fourteen now here at TI and i hope to make twenty five but say if something happened to me i mean
sw2723A-ms98-a-0092 391.230625 397.685625 you know they lay me off uh you have a pension but then you'd have to try to get a pension in another one it would be nice if they could get them together
sw2723A-ms98-a-0093 397.685625 400.879500 i do worry about medical though again knock wood that uh
sw2723A-ms98-a-0094 400.879500 409.367750 i haven't used it i guess you i'm sorry you really do use it throughout the year because you get your teeth fixed and all that i mean i but i'm not i'm talking about major items i haven't used it for anything major
sw2723A-ms98-a-0095 409.367750 411.049750 i'm glad it's there though

sw2723A-ms98-a-0100 431.666750 437.338125 fallen right in line for the the minor things i guess i'm the one just supporting most of the others
sw2723A-ms98-a-0101 437.338125 441.959375 [silence]
sw2723A-ms98-a-0102 441.959375 449.615875 uh yeah yeah i think it's two seventy five for a family but the dental is right away if you exams uh
sw2723A-ms98-a-0103 449.615875 454.054250 okay yeah the medical you have to have a deductible

sw2723A-ms98-a-0110 476.665750 479.257000 yeah that's a typical that's a typical one that's in there
sw2723A-ms98-a-0111 479.257000 481.701875 the forms are right in personnel
sw2723A-ms98-a-0112 481.701875 485.841125 fact you may be able to take care of take advantage of that it's through Baxter Labs
sw2723A-ms98-a-0113 485.841125 486.857250 [silence]
sw2723A-ms98-a-0114 486.857250 488.481750 uh

sw2723A-ms98-a-0119 500.947250 504.960375 you turn you get your doctor to give you a more than six months prescription
sw2723A-ms98-a-0120 504.960375 510.411500 and uh they're twelve dollars again they just were six they just raised them to twelve this year
sw2723A-ms98-a-0121 510.411500 512.869750 twelve dollars for a three months supply
sw2723A-ms98-a-0122 512.869750 517.495375 or whatever whatever the the amount is uh i don't want to say three months but
sw2723A-ms98-a-0123 517.495375 524.832625 it's a lot cheaper allergy medicine's really uh expensive and that blood pressure medicine is fairly expensive i take two
sw2723A-ms98-a-0124 524.832625 525.835875 [silence]
sw2723A-ms98-a-0125 525.835875 531.719250 go right to personnel they got the forms in personnel and maybe i maybe i've told you go something that you didn't know about in benefits [laughter-there]
sw2723A-ms98-a-0126 531.719250 534.629125 i do it yeah i you know it's a very common thing
sw2723A-ms98-a-0127 534.629125 538.030125 it's through Baxter Labs tell yeah
sw2723A-ms98-a-0128 538.030125 539.502000 yeah
sw2723A-ms98-a-0129 539.502000 542.999000 what else i'm sure we're getting close to our five minutes whatever here
sw2723A-ms98-a-0130 542.999000 548.966375 [silence]
sw2723A-ms98-a-0131 548.966375 550.466000 what other benefits
sw2723A-ms98-a-0132 550.466000 551.539625 [silence]
sw2723A-ms98-a-0133 551.539625 558.424375 yeah the salary continuation i think that's a great one but again a hope i never use that one that means you're really sick if you have to use that one
sw2723A-ms98-a-0134 558.424375 559.722375 [silence]
sw2723A-ms98-a-0135 559.722375 565.586375 i'm satisfied with the vacation i don't know what else you know you nice to say you get another week
sw2723A-ms98-a-0136 565.586375 571.532375 and when i'm well i only got fourteen years so i'll get another week when i hit fifteen

sw2723A-ms98-a-0138 573.191500 578.356750 so that's that's fair i mean it's reasonable if four weeks is a lot i think
sw2723A-ms98-a-0139 578.356750 582.950250 i know some people who have twenty five years and thirty and they want more but uh you know
sw2723A-ms98-a-0140 582.950250 584.497875 uh
