sw2703B-ms98-a-0112 426.697750 433.564750 well see baseball here though is the cheapest game in town because the Cowboys it's out[rageous]- it's outrageous to go to the Cowboy game
sw2703B-ms98-a-0113 433.564750 438.497000 and the Mavericks are t[oo]- it's high too so baseball's cheap compared to other games

sw2703B-ms98-a-0115 440.031000 448.676500 well that didn't go s[o]- over now they they they decided you know George Bush who who's the m[ain]- main owner of the Rangers decided that uh
sw2703B-ms98-a-0116 448.676500 452.450000 they'd stay in Arlington so Arlington's going to build a stadium a bigger one
sw2703B-ms98-a-0117 452.450000 458.047875 so we're going to s[tay]- they're going to stay there and which is fine because Arlington's got a lot of things to offer and
sw2703B-ms98-a-0118 458.047875 464.647375 and that was their main main money making you know deal for the city and it would have devastated them_1 if they would have taken it away
sw2703B-ms98-a-0119 464.647375 472.817250 because everything there's Six Flags right by the stadium there's a Wet'n Wild uh and it you know that's all the tourists come there and
sw2703B-ms98-a-0120 472.817250 479.763500 and they it would have been devastated they would have collapsed so i'm kind of glad they're staying there because it's right in the middle of Fort Worth Dallas and you know

sw2703B-ms98-a-0124 490.843000 497.267875 and it's takes us maybe uh we[ll]- well thirty five to forty minutes to get there from Plano which is not bad at all
