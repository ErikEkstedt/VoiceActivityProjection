sw2780A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 10.831250 yeah i think um this is a tough subject because uh when you come from two different parts of the country uh the political views are really different
sw2780A-ms98-a-0002 10.831250 17.288500 i uh i i guess i've had to discuss a number of what might be considered controversial issues
sw2780A-ms98-a-0003 17.288500 23.517375 i guess like i like and though nothing i guess nothing is a[s]- as awful as abortion but like gun control 
sw2780A-ms98-a-0004 23.517375 33.521625 and uh day care and things like that and there are some very different views uh of the people connected with the program which i thought was really interesting you know
sw2780A-ms98-a-0005 33.521625 36.634500 [silence]
sw2780A-ms98-a-0006 36.634500 37.513000 w[ell]-
sw2780A-ms98-a-0007 37.513000 49.469875 yeah well being i[n]- in in Baltimore see Maryland is um is sort a um is prob[ably]- l[iberalism]- [vocalized-noise] is a is a hub of liberalism [laughter] you know compared to the country uh you know very um 
sw2780A-ms98-a-0008 49.469875 60.429625 in in many ways uh very liberal very similar to New England though Pennsylvania and New York uh i [vocalized-noise] aren't actually as liberal Maryland is a very liberal uh 
sw2780A-ms98-a-0009 60.429625 70.770500 state so so wh[ere]- where here we have um we have gun control laws we probably have some of the strictest gun controls laws in the nation and most people in Maryland vote for that
sw2780A-ms98-a-0010 70.770500 73.330125 you know so it really is a different um
sw2780A-ms98-a-0011 73.330125 78.620000 [silence]
sw2780A-ms98-a-0012 78.620000 85.206875 yeah that's that's true i talked to a i had to talk about gun control with somebody and i talked with a woman who actually
sw2780A-ms98-a-0013 85.206875 94.317000 you know h[ad]- h[ad]- had just purchased a gun that day and was going target shooting you know and it was very different it was a whole different view it's really um
sw2780A-ms98-a-0014 94.317000 102.546625 this has opened my eyes to thinking you know at one time i just sat here and thought well how can anybody believe that because i'd really never met people that did
sw2780A-ms98-a-0015 102.546625 106.061000 and now i talk to people that do so that's it's really interesting
sw2780A-ms98-a-0016 106.061000 108.623250 [silence]
sw2780A-ms98-a-0017 108.623250 109.649125 um-hum

sw2780A-ms98-a-0030 152.925125 167.092500 yeah well you can possess them_1 here too but they have to be they're registered and uh like the the the Brady Bill that's currently being discussed nationally and whatever is very well supported here in gun control avenues and um
sw2780A-ms98-a-0031 167.092500 169.163750 [silence]
sw2780A-ms98-a-0032 169.163750 171.548375 you have the seven day waiting period
sw2780A-ms98-a-0033 171.548375 173.422625 yeah that's uh that's
sw2780A-ms98-a-0034 173.422625 175.918000 [silence]
sw2780A-ms98-a-0035 175.918000 177.014500 yeah

sw2780A-ms98-a-0037 187.267500 192.440625 yeah that's true that's very true that's and that's the way m[ost]- i guess most of the um 
sw2780A-ms98-a-0038 192.440625 199.238625 the political organizations work you know the same i know the abortion issue with right to life and right to choose and
sw2780A-ms98-a-0039 199.238625 209.688500 and both of them are uh both want the extent of extremes so that they don't give anything for a balance you know there's there's always that difficulty
sw2780A-ms98-a-0040 209.688500 210.260750 [noise]
sw2780A-ms98-a-0041 210.260750 212.324125 [silence]
sw2780A-ms98-a-0042 212.324125 215.287625 um i would say i'm probably liberal yeah
sw2780A-ms98-a-0043 215.287625 216.580250 yeah
sw2780A-ms98-a-0044 216.580250 217.854375 sure
sw2780A-ms98-a-0045 217.854375 224.975500 [silence]
sw2780A-ms98-a-0046 224.975500 226.226500 well i'll tell you
sw2780A-ms98-a-0047 226.226500 232.383875 i i think you know if they if they didn't give as much coverage to these idiots that burn the flag
sw2780A-ms98-a-0048 232.383875 234.825125 it would never happen do you know what i mean
sw2780A-ms98-a-0049 234.825125 246.884375 it's only because they make a big stink over it but i i guess actually i believe that if somebody wants to burn the flag i guess that's their opportunity their their their right in the sense of freedom of speech but i- i would never
sw2780A-ms98-a-0050 246.884375 247.754000 yeah
sw2780A-ms98-a-0051 247.754000 250.940500 [silence]
sw2780A-ms98-a-0052 250.940500 252.163750 yeah
sw2780A-ms98-a-0053 252.163750 261.058875 well it's free[dom]- that they i think the idea of freedom of speech goes back to and i uh uh the the the whole aspect of being able to display your
sw2780A-ms98-a-0054 261.058875 262.379500 uh
sw2780A-ms98-a-0055 262.379500 267.874000 your ideas you know the what the country stands on America stands on is that they can do that
sw2780A-ms98-a-0056 267.874000 273.671500 uh though i would never even consider it in a million years to do it myself i i i think uh 
sw2780A-ms98-a-0057 273.671500 288.219375 you know but i i still what the stan[ds]- flag stands for i guess to me is that if somebody wants to voice their opinion or display their opinion openly and if that is a a way that they can show their opinion then they should be allowed
sw2780A-ms98-a-0058 288.219375 289.518875 uh
sw2780A-ms98-a-0059 289.518875 299.874250 unless the bur[ning]- unless the actual fire hinders somebody's health and well-being you know but i i think that's i guess that's i thin[k]- that's my opinion yeah i guess you feel differently
sw2780A-ms98-a-0060 299.874250 302.642125 [silence]
sw2780A-ms98-a-0061 302.642125 315.078750 uh no but i think that's that's the it's that's taxpayer's money if somebody buys their own flag and and burns it that's fine but that that's you know that's destruction and o[f]- of uh
sw2780A-ms98-a-0062 315.078750 317.416250 public property and whatever
sw2780A-ms98-a-0063 317.416250 329.591750 [silence]
sw2780A-ms98-a-0064 329.591750 337.101875 no i don't know i guess the symbolism oh i think what America stands for is the right to be able to disagree with the government
sw2780A-ms98-a-0065 337.101875 340.075500 uh i think that's what's made democracy
sw2780A-ms98-a-0066 340.075500 341.150250 yeah
sw2780A-ms98-a-0067 341.150250 342.125125 [silence]
sw2780A-ms98-a-0068 342.125125 343.542500 um-hum yeah
sw2780A-ms98-a-0069 343.542500 345.832000 [silence]
sw2780A-ms98-a-0070 345.832000 350.182000 well that's that's true yeah but i think i i g[uess]-
sw2780A-ms98-a-0071 350.182000 360.789375 yeah i i g[uess]- i guess the idea you know they always keep saying like the framers um there uh of one of the Republican the appointees for the ju[dicial]- the judicial bench
sw2780A-ms98-a-0072 360.789375 371.542000 and they always talk about that they they feel that this person believes in the framing of the constitution what the original framers the ideals the original framers set down and um
sw2780A-ms98-a-0073 371.542000 383.579625 i believe that the idea of burning the flag is is in my understanding of how it was framed is that you this coun[try]- the thing about this country is that you can disagree with its government and you can display that
sw2780A-ms98-a-0074 383.579625 393.026250 uh i g[uess]- yeah i guess and and so that as a freedom of expression and speech and whatever i- i think that that's viable [noise] um
sw2780A-ms98-a-0075 393.026250 401.887625 as long as it's your flag and and you've made your your point i think yeah yeah because realistically like for you for you you don't think it's right
sw2780A-ms98-a-0076 401.887625 407.171375 and i would never do it i i love this country too much and that symbol means a lot to me
sw2780A-ms98-a-0077 407.171375 413.458750 um but i guess it's just one of those things where if they if that's what's something if a need for them
sw2780A-ms98-a-0078 413.458750 414.736125 you know
sw2780A-ms98-a-0079 414.736125 419.817875 [silence]
sw2780A-ms98-a-0080 419.817875 421.600250 yeah yes
sw2780A-ms98-a-0081 421.600250 422.992875 no
sw2780A-ms98-a-0082 422.992875 426.869250 [silence]
sw2780A-ms98-a-0083 426.869250 427.966250 right

sw2780A-ms98-a-0091 462.687500 466.913000 i agree there too i agree with you there too i i the um
sw2780A-ms98-a-0092 466.913000 474.221750 i i it's i find it you know personally disgusting but i don't think that i don't think that uh
sw2780A-ms98-a-0093 474.221750 483.865375 we have a right to stop somebody from that you know the same i don't know i guess i get i get all all mixed up inside when
sw2780A-ms98-a-0094 483.865375 497.417000 yeah it g[ets]- when it's uh it's an emotional issue and you sit and you try and think about it logically and and and you know you try to say to yourself now emotionally this is a disgusting thing uh but logically
sw2780A-ms98-a-0095 497.417000 505.563375 um even you know for instance the pro-life pro-choice movement uh you know i don't know anybody that actually supports abortion
sw2780A-ms98-a-0096 505.563375 508.270000 but they would vote pro-choice
sw2780A-ms98-a-0097 508.270000 518.027375 because you know that's just a disgusting thing you know somebody an abortion means it's somebody's in trouble and that it's an awful thing
sw2780A-ms98-a-0098 518.027375 519.075375 you know but
sw2780A-ms98-a-0099 519.075375 520.606375 [silence]
sw2780A-ms98-a-0100 520.606375 521.712750 yeah
sw2780A-ms98-a-0101 521.712750 533.412750 but it that's uh that's what i mean see mo[st]- but but realistically when you think of it it just sounds like such an awful thing and it evokes an emotional response i think that's the hardest thing i don't know if i could ever be a judge
sw2780A-ms98-a-0102 533.412750 538.612125 because some things emotionally just aren't you know
sw2780A-ms98-a-0103 538.612125 541.377750 [silence]
sw2780A-ms98-a-0104 541.377750 544.436125 no no i think the um
sw2780A-ms98-a-0105 544.436125 550.109750 sometimes i guess what did i read recently the um the the uh Christian
sw2780A-ms98-a-0106 550.109750 555.259750 uh point i[s]- is always the point of well it's at conception
sw2780A-ms98-a-0107 555.259750 567.287125 but then um a friend of mine's a doctor and argues with others that conception is a biblical term and there's no concept of conception in medicine or biology
sw2780A-ms98-a-0108 567.287125 578.408375 so then that so that throws out that idea it makes it a religious discussion then so it['s]- i don't know it's very it's it's uh you know it's a it's a topsy turvy world and it's really something how
sw2780A-ms98-a-0109 578.408375 585.777250 um political ideas and viewpoints within one country can vary so much and also within um
sw2780A-ms98-a-0110 585.777250 586.849125 within a
sw2780A-ms98-a-0111 586.849125 588.205875 [silence]
sw2780A-ms98-a-0112 588.205875 592.869250 yeah and how yeah how it'll sway from one e[xtreme]- one extreme to another
sw2780A-ms98-a-0113 592.869250 595.281250 uh i think that uh
sw2780A-ms98-a-0114 595.281250 600.579750 you know i i just read something i think in Time magazine uh ab[out]- about um protest on
