sw2784A-ms98-a-0002 0.477000 11.296375 i pay a good deal of taxes i guess because i- i make a fair amount of money and uh the taxes that i pay um i guess as a as a general statement i feel i
sw2784A-ms98-a-0003 11.296375 13.529000 i guess i get my money's worth for
sw2784A-ms98-a-0004 13.529000 14.699125 [silence]
sw2784A-ms98-a-0005 14.699125 17.395750 i'm not sure though whether i feel
sw2784A-ms98-a-0006 17.395750 20.983000 i guess i am sure that i feel that in general though
sw2784A-ms98-a-0007 20.983000 26.423875 uh the allocation uh of the taxes in certain areas i[sn't]- isn't correct
sw2784A-ms98-a-0008 26.423875 31.400125 [silence]
sw2784A-ms98-a-0009 31.400125 32.713875 [laughter]
sw2784A-ms98-a-0010 32.713875 35.720625 [silence]
sw2784A-ms98-a-0011 35.720625 45.770250 well i- i lately i guess um uh or at least for the last t[wenty]- twenty years or so i've felt that the expenditures of our taxes into high
sw2784A-ms98-a-0012 45.770250 53.282875 cost uh defense items at least in the last ten years have been uh there's been and extraordinary amount of
sw2784A-ms98-a-0013 53.282875 57.555250 money spent there and i'm not really sure that that we've gotten our money's worth there
sw2784A-ms98-a-0014 57.555250 62.530000 uh regardless of the outcome of the Desert Storm uh Desert Shield uh situations
sw2784A-ms98-a-0015 62.530000 63.581250 [silence]
sw2784A-ms98-a-0016 63.581250 76.137500 uh i guess my particular beef is that having participated in the mi[litary]- military off and on over the over the years of being called back and things of that nature is uh i've found that you know there's an extraordinary amount of waste i take that as a
sw2784A-ms98-a-0017 76.137500 78.995125 as a given in any military operation and 
sw2784A-ms98-a-0018 78.995125 80.238000 [silence]
sw2784A-ms98-a-0019 80.238000 90.167875 yeah and i gue[ss]- i- i should imagine that that that what the what the problem why i i'm i'm a little concerned about today is that this uh rather uh quick and
sw2784A-ms98-a-0020 90.167875 97.911125 and easy i don't know i shouldn't say easy rather quick victory in the in in the uh Mideast uh uh over the uh Iraqis uh
sw2784A-ms98-a-0021 97.911125 107.321500 might lead us into uh a false sense of security that we can do that against any other foe i'm i- i don't know what other foe that would be but
sw2784A-ms98-a-0022 107.321500 114.235250 uh i i'm just getting nervous again now hearing the voices come up that there has to be increased expenditures in that area
sw2784A-ms98-a-0023 114.235250 142.013625 [silence]
sw2784A-ms98-a-0024 142.013625 151.153750 yeah but it it it it would that be uh well let's see two thousand out of eleven thousand that's about a little over twenty per cent uh i- i should imagine that
sw2784A-ms98-a-0025 151.153750 158.582500 that would be to keep it at a level those levels i guess that that were originally appropriated w[as]- was when
sw2784A-ms98-a-0026 158.582500 163.022125 the Soviet threat i guess was perceived as being
sw2784A-ms98-a-0027 163.022125 166.529250 a greater one i don't think there's very much of a threat there today
sw2784A-ms98-a-0028 166.529250 173.834125 i do worry about what nuclear weapons are left in the territories uh in their territory over there and who's controlling them but [laughter]
sw2784A-ms98-a-0029 173.834125 179.910125 i- i don't know what amount of what amount of our hardware would stop some fanatic i guess from doing anything
sw2784A-ms98-a-0030 179.910125 181.819750 uh that would be irrational
sw2784A-ms98-a-0031 181.819750 183.924875 [silence]
sw2784A-ms98-a-0032 183.924875 185.409375 right
sw2784A-ms98-a-0033 185.409375 186.677375 yeah

sw2784A-ms98-a-0035 192.969750 194.030125 yeah

sw2784A-ms98-a-0037 197.738375 199.551500 w[hat]- what is the name of that
sw2784A-ms98-a-0038 199.551500 200.663250 [silence]
sw2784A-ms98-a-0039 200.663250 201.825375 yes yes
sw2784A-ms98-a-0040 201.825375 214.589750 [silence]
sw2784A-ms98-a-0041 214.589750 219.868750 yeah well i- i- i'm what i'm uh i guess uh it concerned about talking about the taxes in general and
sw2784A-ms98-a-0042 219.868750 226.918500 that that was an area that i- i perceive as not being the best expenditure for the amount of dollar that we're taxed for
sw2784A-ms98-a-0043 226.918500 234.928500 uh in the area of defense or perhaps we have paid too much there i don't know it just seems to me that over the years now the and and it's
sw2784A-ms98-a-0044 234.928500 243.048625 it's a cliche i- i but i see it myself i see where the infrastructure is sort of breaking down the roads the highways
sw2784A-ms98-a-0045 243.048625 252.341375 i- i- i don't know uh i kn[ow]- i'm familiar with some some upbeat school areas so i don't totally agree with the the great
sw2784A-ms98-a-0046 252.341375 262.337125 uh uh with the with the great ex[penditure]- expenditure of effort and time there but i guess overall because i guess i'm not associated with what ghetto schools and and uh
sw2784A-ms98-a-0047 262.337125 268.480375 and uh rural school systems are like i- i should imagine that would take an enormous expenditure
sw2784A-ms98-a-0048 268.480375 291.424000 [silence]
sw2784A-ms98-a-0049 291.424000 292.937625 um-hum
sw2784A-ms98-a-0050 292.937625 295.936250 [silence]
sw2784A-ms98-a-0051 295.936250 301.782375 that they don't have a broad based income tax that funds the educational system or is it all funded out of local taxes
sw2784A-ms98-a-0052 301.782375 310.474500 [silence]
sw2784A-ms98-a-0053 310.474500 311.504000 yeah
sw2784A-ms98-a-0054 311.504000 325.856625 [silence]
sw2784A-ms98-a-0055 325.856625 329.966250 sounds like the way the federal and state system works [laughter-now] yeah
sw2784A-ms98-a-0056 329.966250 339.358625 [silence]
sw2784A-ms98-a-0057 339.358625 341.763875 uh do you mean a a complete reversal
sw2784A-ms98-a-0058 341.763875 351.547625 [silence]
sw2784A-ms98-a-0059 351.547625 355.766875 because i guess they can't raise that money in those those poorer districts huh
sw2784A-ms98-a-0060 355.766875 365.518500 [silence]
sw2784A-ms98-a-0061 365.518500 366.454625 yeah
sw2784A-ms98-a-0062 366.454625 381.550500 [silence]
sw2784A-ms98-a-0063 381.550500 391.077750 yes i see what you're saying uh i uh i- i do i- i guess i am a s[trong]- uh a strong and staunch supporter of some subsidy
sw2784A-ms98-a-0064 391.077750 394.999125 for any forms of education i mean by that i mean
sw2784A-ms98-a-0065 394.999125 403.003500 i'm a product myself i have uh a a a a background of uh being uh getting my college education through the GI Bill
sw2784A-ms98-a-0066 403.003500 410.415500 what but [vocalized-noise] uh when i look at it to me uh it doesn't really make any difference it was a marvelous opportunity that i couldn't have done
sw2784A-ms98-a-0067 410.415500 414.255125 i don't think i would have gone on unless i had that financial
sw2784A-ms98-a-0068 414.255125 416.695500 uh easement made possible
sw2784A-ms98-a-0069 416.695500 421.723000 and i- i don't really care what it takes to qualify whether you're uh an an [vocalized-noise]
sw2784A-ms98-a-0070 421.723000 432.200000 [laughter-whether] [laughter-you're] [laughter-a] [laughter-veteran] or whether you i don't even know if you have to perform community service or unless uh or or you promise to even do something in the future i think that uh the
sw2784A-ms98-a-0071 432.200000 433.514625 that that
sw2784A-ms98-a-0072 433.514625 438.437750 the subsidy itself or i guess the enactment of that form of legislation
sw2784A-ms98-a-0073 438.437750 448.742750 would give many people who i- i think i i think i perceive the fact at least what i read is that some younger people feel that education is priced out of their 
sw2784A-ms98-a-0074 448.742750 460.152500 uh out of their uh budget i know in the state of Florida just today uh the the legislature uh adjourned and uh they had completed a fifteen per cent increase in the
sw2784A-ms98-a-0075 460.152500 470.893000 in the uh state land grant colleges which which isn't i mean to me it doesn't sound like a [mot/lot] of money but i guess it would be for fifteen hundred dollars a year they went from eleven to fifteen hundred
sw2784A-ms98-a-0076 470.893000 476.790125 and uh for an out of state student the tuition went up twenty five per cent i don't know what that would be
sw2784A-ms98-a-0077 476.790125 480.244875 [silence]
sw2784A-ms98-a-0078 480.244875 487.124625 but that uh i guess that goes along with the general idea that the federal government had to uh was expending so much money on defense uh that
sw2784A-ms98-a-0079 487.124625 498.797500 that the program now is a uh program now is uh fees that that fund these things i guess that's trickled down to the states and the states now establish uh don't have enough money so they
sw2784A-ms98-a-0080 498.797500 503.262250 they must charge fees uh i- i i'm not too sure of that reasoning
sw2784A-ms98-a-0081 503.262250 507.929125 but i guess to get back to the main topic i don't know whether i pay too much taxes i
sw2784A-ms98-a-0082 507.929125 513.680625 i- i travel extensively in Europe and see enormous uh people p[ay]- pay uh a great deal
sw2784A-ms98-a-0083 513.680625 517.341250 in taxes they tell me when i sit and talk to people there they tell me they
sw2784A-ms98-a-0084 517.341250 520.650750 they some states they pay uh in Germany or in
sw2784A-ms98-a-0085 520.650750 531.020500 in England in some cases people in my income level at least allege that they pay up to six fifty five percent of their gross income in taxes
sw2784A-ms98-a-0086 531.020500 538.349500 but but i'm not too sure when i put my property tax in my car tax my income tax
sw2784A-ms98-a-0087 538.349500 546.165125 and these myriad of uh now it costs me money to leave the country some sort of a tax to leave the country some sort of an airport departure tax
sw2784A-ms98-a-0088 546.165125 554.941875 uh uh a tax a sales tax which is getting to uh quite high levels i'm not sure that i'm not up fairly close to that
sw2784A-ms98-a-0089 554.941875 560.426750 [silence]
sw2784A-ms98-a-0090 560.426750 562.109125 you really think so
sw2784A-ms98-a-0091 562.109125 568.124000 but i mean w[hat]- what's what's happened here is is is i feel that that in the last ten years
sw2784A-ms98-a-0092 568.124000 574.951000 uh my taxes have gone up they haven't gone down i pay [vocalized-noise] uh quite a bit more taxes and and and
sw2784A-ms98-a-0093 574.951000 577.955125 but that's been a Republican government for the last ten years
sw2784A-ms98-a-0094 577.955125 582.372250 [silence]
sw2784A-ms98-a-0095 582.372250 583.365250 well i-

sw2784A-ms98-a-0099 588.678500 593.833375 okay uh i guess i just push something here push one again right
sw2784A-ms98-a-0100 593.833375 595.402750 just hang up
