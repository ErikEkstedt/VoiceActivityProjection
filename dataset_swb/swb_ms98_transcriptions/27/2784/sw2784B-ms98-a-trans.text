sw2784B-ms98-a-0003 14.827500 27.378375 [silence]
sw2784B-ms98-a-0004 27.378375 32.070125 well i'm sure that uh probably every person in this country would agree with you on that
sw2784B-ms98-a-0005 32.070125 35.237625 because_1 everybody has a different idea of where the money should go
sw2784B-ms98-a-0006 35.237625 59.976750 [silence]
sw2784B-ms98-a-0007 59.976750 61.085625 uh-huh
sw2784B-ms98-a-0008 61.085625 62.278500 [silence]
sw2784B-ms98-a-0009 62.278500 63.239625 yeah
sw2784B-ms98-a-0010 63.239625 78.555000 [silence]
sw2784B-ms98-a-0011 78.555000 80.773000 oh yeah no argument here
sw2784B-ms98-a-0012 80.773000 114.973500 [silence]
sw2784B-ms98-a-0013 114.973500 126.609250 yeah well of course uh a lot of uh a lot of missiles and things were expended in the course of fighting the war and the and the inventory's going to have to be restocked
sw2784B-ms98-a-0014 126.609250 130.875625 uh on now i work for TI and one of the things we were told is
sw2784B-ms98-a-0015 130.875625 137.203750 like they had eleven thousand Harm missiles which TI is the sole supplier for and they used up two thousand of them in in the war
sw2784B-ms98-a-0016 137.203750 143.531750 so they're going to have to do another contract to restock that to get ready in case something else is needed
sw2784B-ms98-a-0017 143.531750 172.458250 [silence]
sw2784B-ms98-a-0018 172.458250 174.989250 that that's true that's true
sw2784B-ms98-a-0019 174.989250 180.004625 [silence]
sw2784B-ms98-a-0020 180.004625 186.372250 well of of course now we used up twenty per cents per cent of that inventory in a matter of just a few weeks
sw2784B-ms98-a-0021 186.372250 193.029625 and uh uh uh TI also makes the [vocalized-noise] missile which was the the TV laser guided bombs 
sw2784B-ms98-a-0022 193.029625 198.375625 and and a big percentage of that was expended as well that [vocalized-noise] that w[as]- that was just a matter of
sw2784B-ms98-a-0023 198.375625 199.398750 [silence]
sw2784B-ms98-a-0024 199.398750 200.896125 uh it's called Paveway
sw2784B-ms98-a-0025 200.896125 202.246375 [silence]
sw2784B-ms98-a-0026 202.246375 206.580250 and uh a big percentage of that was used up during that conflict also
sw2784B-ms98-a-0027 206.580250 208.570125 so tho[se]- those are two
sw2784B-ms98-a-0028 208.570125 215.060500 areas in which TI stands to to gain some some short term business to restock that
sw2784B-ms98-a-0029 215.060500 242.223750 [silence]
sw2784B-ms98-a-0030 242.223750 243.918750 oh no doubt
sw2784B-ms98-a-0031 243.918750 267.520750 [silence]
sw2784B-ms98-a-0032 267.520750 270.803625 yeah as a matter of fact in Texas um
sw2784B-ms98-a-0033 270.803625 275.056500 we've had our school funding system declared unconstitutional
sw2784B-ms98-a-0034 275.056500 277.415500 by the a state judge
sw2784B-ms98-a-0035 277.415500 282.437875 and they and uh the legislature just passed what they called a Robin Hood Bill
sw2784B-ms98-a-0036 282.437875 284.636625 which basically what it does
sw2784B-ms98-a-0037 284.636625 292.435250 is it takes extra money from the more affluent school districts that are that are you know come from local taxes
sw2784B-ms98-a-0038 292.435250 296.038500 and send them to other parts of the state that are not so affluent
sw2784B-ms98-a-0039 296.038500 299.502500 [silence]
sw2784B-ms98-a-0040 299.502500 301.027000 uh well
sw2784B-ms98-a-0041 301.027000 306.651875 okay to g[ive]- to give you some perspective this this town that i had lived in for sometime 
sw2784B-ms98-a-0042 306.651875 311.176125 in nineteen eighty three was funded sixty five per cent by state funds
sw2784B-ms98-a-0043 311.176125 314.440250 then we had a number of education reforms
sw2784B-ms98-a-0044 314.440250 322.199000 that the legislature said hey we got to do this we got to do this we got to do this but they forgot to put in the state budget
sw2784B-ms98-a-0045 322.199000 326.135250 the money to pay for it and they dumped it all on the local school districts
sw2784B-ms98-a-0046 326.135250 326.982375 so
sw2784B-ms98-a-0047 326.982375 328.509500 [silence]
sw2784B-ms98-a-0048 328.509500 329.864875 really so
sw2784B-ms98-a-0049 329.864875 337.624750 so what ended up happening was was a was a shift we went to sixty five per cent state funding to sixty five per cent local funding in a matter of four years
sw2784B-ms98-a-0050 337.624750 339.317000 and uh
sw2784B-ms98-a-0051 339.317000 340.205875 i mean
sw2784B-ms98-a-0052 340.205875 341.228000 [silence]
sw2784B-ms98-a-0053 341.228000 342.360625 oh complete
sw2784B-ms98-a-0054 342.360625 344.961000 complete it's all shifted to local districts
sw2784B-ms98-a-0055 344.961000 348.262750 and now even the money that's been raised for the local districts is being
sw2784B-ms98-a-0056 348.262750 350.963625 is going to be siphoned off and sent to other parts of the state
sw2784B-ms98-a-0057 350.963625 355.838250 [silence]
sw2784B-ms98-a-0058 355.838250 358.840500 that's right and and i have i have no problem
sw2784B-ms98-a-0059 358.840500 361.529500 with uh a certain
sw2784B-ms98-a-0060 361.529500 373.068125 uh floor level minimum level that's a standard uh that everybody uh ought to be able to have uh but i am opposed to
sw2784B-ms98-a-0061 373.068125 381.772125 [vocalized-noise] any attempts to restrict um local communities from taxing themselves above that to provide above the minimum
