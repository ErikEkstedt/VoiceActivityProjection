sw2709B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.946125 [noise]
sw2709B-ms98-a-0002 0.946125 11.848250 well i'll tell you why i feel so i feel strongly about this topic i don't know a whole lot about the immigration laws but i do know that in the where i live and i teach school
sw2709B-ms98-a-0003 11.848250 23.410000 there are so many Orientals that have come here and there's a lot of Mexican people too which is not neither here nor there but the fact is that all the Orientals that are here are very affluent
sw2709B-ms98-a-0004 23.410000 31.934500 uh very wise in money matters and have ta[ken]- have taken over a lot of businesses and have really
sw2709B-ms98-a-0005 31.934500 38.437375 ki[nd]- it's kind of scary because they're so bright they're all the kids that i have that are Oriental are really far above
sw2709B-ms98-a-0006 38.437375 47.257750 the American kids and they and the the parents are unbelievable because they are just on the way up and money is their main goal
sw2709B-ms98-a-0007 47.257750 56.745125 and it's k[ind]- it really is kind of scary because there's there's just oodles of them_1 and you can not believe the businesses and corporations that have been taken over by Orientals
sw2709B-ms98-a-0008 56.745125 71.467000 and it's k[ind]- it's kind of scares me not that i don't want them here and not that i don't appreciate the fact that you know that they have rights too but [noise] on the other hand you feel like almost they're they're invading us to the point where they're going to take over
sw2709B-ms98-a-0009 71.467000 82.987250 [silence]
sw2709B-ms98-a-0010 82.987250 92.398375 i think probably that's a good idea because i lived in Iowa for a[bout]- for about ten years before i came here and i was born in Ohio
sw2709B-ms98-a-0011 92.398375 105.996875 so it it really and there is there are a lot of Mexican people here because we're so close to the border and and they are wonderful people and and i'm not you know i don't want to deny them their rights just that you you feel like when you
sw2709B-ms98-a-0012 105.996875 111.415500 were born and raised here and you worked re[al]- very hard to make this country what it is
sw2709B-ms98-a-0013 111.415500 123.575625 uh it scares you when you feel like somebody's taking over and a lot of these people plan one day to go back you know to to Vietnam or to you know Taiwan or wherever they're from
sw2709B-ms98-a-0014 123.575625 136.979250 and take with them a lot of American dollars plus a lot of power in American com[panies]- com[panies]- companies and it's kind of scary [laughter] and you know i don't know i don't know the immigration laws that uh that well and i do not and in fact i don't know them at all i don't know how many
sw2709B-ms98-a-0015 136.979250 147.497250 people they allow in the United States per year or if there's even a i don't even know if there is a number that they allow in anymore do you know anything about that
sw2709B-ms98-a-0016 147.497250 160.791375 [silence]
sw2709B-ms98-a-0017 160.791375 162.793500 um-hum
sw2709B-ms98-a-0018 162.793500 168.260625 [silence]
sw2709B-ms98-a-0019 168.260625 169.724750 yeah
sw2709B-ms98-a-0020 169.724750 172.988625 [silence]
sw2709B-ms98-a-0021 172.988625 175.299375 i would think so too it
sw2709B-ms98-a-0022 175.299375 184.495000 [silence]
sw2709B-ms98-a-0023 184.495000 186.498250 uh-huh uh-huh
sw2709B-ms98-a-0024 186.498250 187.505500 [silence]
sw2709B-ms98-a-0025 187.505500 189.996250 asylum of some sort
sw2709B-ms98-a-0026 189.996250 191.823000 um-hum
sw2709B-ms98-a-0027 191.823000 196.294125 [silence]
sw2709B-ms98-a-0028 196.294125 197.757375 well
sw2709B-ms98-a-0029 197.757375 202.468625 [silence]
sw2709B-ms98-a-0030 202.468625 208.309375 well i teach in the suburb of Dallas and and uh my kids go to school in another suburb of Dallas
sw2709B-ms98-a-0031 208.309375 220.108375 and uh with very very good school systems and they're considered you know one of the top three in the state both of them you know and it seems like a lot of the Orientals make sure that their kids go to these schools
sw2709B-ms98-a-0032 220.108375 231.998125 and they're head and shoulders above a lot of the kids here and the kids in this area are very bright and come from you know parents that are professionals or semiprofessionals and and uh very interested in their education but
sw2709B-ms98-a-0033 231.998125 239.559000 uh i think in the last year i'm not if i'm not mistaken in four of the six high schools
sw2709B-ms98-a-0034 239.559000 247.999000 the graduating class valedictorian and salutatorian were uh alm[ost]- half or more Oriental
sw2709B-ms98-a-0035 247.999000 253.198250 and you know they're just extremely bright kids and also they value learning
sw2709B-ms98-a-0036 253.198250 257.747625 [silence]
sw2709B-ms98-a-0037 257.747625 266.960500 well i- i think things come easy for them_1 too but i do think that they have that work ethic that we somehow have missed the boat in with a lot of kids in the United States i don't
sw2709B-ms98-a-0038 266.960500 277.299375 they uh don't want to work for anything they want it to come to them but and be there but they don't want to work hard and these kids work really hard and and they have
sw2709B-ms98-a-0039 277.299375 280.269625 [silence]
sw2709B-ms98-a-0040 280.269625 283.783375 yeah i know i agree with that i agree with that
sw2709B-ms98-a-0041 283.783375 286.490750 [silence]
sw2709B-ms98-a-0042 286.490750 299.234125 but what i see is you the competition is there but instead of meeting the challenge they're starting to resent them and it's causing you know i think some some problems
sw2709B-ms98-a-0043 299.234125 310.251875 it really is it because we see a lot of racial problems in Dall[as]- the Dallas area anyway especially in Dallas and it's mainly Black and and and Hispanic
sw2709B-ms98-a-0044 310.251875 323.986250 but uh there is some there has been some resentment with Orientals in the Black community because they've started businesses there and the Blacks resent them coming in and taking their money and there's been some violence because of it
sw2709B-ms98-a-0045 323.986250 333.934000 it is it's it is very sad so you know i really i i've i've always prided [laughter-myself] on not being prejudice and being
sw2709B-ms98-a-0046 333.934000 347.537125 you know um welcom[ing]- welcoming everyone that wants to come here and even when i was younger wh[en]- when i was in college i was a member of the NAACP because_1 i lived up north and i was very into that the human rights part of everything
sw2709B-ms98-a-0047 347.537125 353.994250 but i i've i've become very cynical in the last three four years living in Texas
sw2709B-ms98-a-0048 353.994250 369.280250 [silence]
sw2709B-ms98-a-0049 369.280250 371.473500 um-hum um-hum
sw2709B-ms98-a-0050 371.473500 380.998375 well and exactly that's exactly true plus the fact that these people do come for a short period of time two two three four maybe five years and then go back
sw2709B-ms98-a-0051 380.998375 395.455875 and pick our brains which is wonderful and take all that back with them and and uh plus a lot of American dollars but in in the long run maybe that's going to make a better world too you know you just don't know
sw2709B-ms98-a-0052 395.455875 398.764125 an[d]- and yet you know with uh with uh
sw2709B-ms98-a-0053 398.764125 402.997125 there's somebody on my other line but i'm going to [laughter-ignore] that um
sw2709B-ms98-a-0054 402.997125 408.176125 anyway i just you you kind of you don['t]- you really don't know what to do and and 
sw2709B-ms98-a-0055 408.176125 414.452500 i don't i want my kids to have values where they're accepting and so forth and both of my children
sw2709B-ms98-a-0056 414.452500 426.290500 are really tol[erant]- more tolerant of Blacks and Hi[spanics]- Hispanics than they are of the Orientals for some reason they feel you know like they've taken over they feel like uh you know they're taking some of the
sw2709B-ms98-a-0057 426.290500 431.677125 the rewards that they should have and and i really don't want that to happen but but it's happening
sw2709B-ms98-a-0058 431.677125 435.169625 and i think a lot of their friends feel the same way too so
sw2709B-ms98-a-0059 435.169625 447.220625 and i really do wish i knew about quotas and really wish i <b_aside> hi <e_aside> i really do wish i i knew more about immigration laws because i have no idea any more because they've changed a great deal
sw2709B-ms98-a-0060 447.220625 453.656000 [silence]
sw2709B-ms98-a-0061 453.656000 460.999875 yeah i do[n't]- i don't really either i wish i knew more and probably if i did i might be a little bit more uh tolerant
sw2709B-ms98-a-0062 460.999875 473.952500 perhaps and i and even if i- i really wish i knew the situations they were going back to or coming from you don't know any of that and you feel you know you can't put yourself in their shoes or really understand them unless
sw2709B-ms98-a-0063 473.952500 477.255750 and for some reason Orientals are very
sw2709B-ms98-a-0064 477.255750 486.266750 uh my good friend calls them pushy but i call them very that they know what they want and they go get it and in stores and so forth [vocalized-noise]
sw2709B-ms98-a-0065 486.266750 495.036125 well pardon me [vocalized-noise] yeah but in stores and things sometimes they can be very impolite because they can they get in front of you or they 
sw2709B-ms98-a-0066 495.036125 509.232000 um they take something that you had in mind to get before you did you know just going for it they take it quickly and uh they don't think anything of that and i don't you know that's makes people resentful too and
sw2709B-ms98-a-0067 509.232000 514.995125 and yet they have they have a right to be here and i know that but it's it sometimes it's gets touchy
sw2709B-ms98-a-0068 514.995125 520.981125 so and i'm sure it's a lot different you're from Maryland you said what part of Maryland are you from
sw2709B-ms98-a-0069 520.981125 522.499500 [silence]
sw2709B-ms98-a-0070 522.499500 531.999750 oh okay my sister used to live there in that area and i i'm sure that it's a lot different there uh it's a lot different in I[owa]- than in Iowa than it is here 
sw2709B-ms98-a-0071 531.999750 538.775000 [silence]
sw2709B-ms98-a-0072 538.775000 540.222375 is that right
sw2709B-ms98-a-0073 540.222375 556.491250 [silence]
sw2709B-ms98-a-0074 556.491250 567.200250 um-hum well i you know since i teach i see that see it and and i feel and i love the example that most of these children an[d]- give the
sw2709B-ms98-a-0075 567.200250 575.661500 our American children and yet you know i can see why some of the parents are fear[ful]- that are fearful too and and it's a kind of a touchy situation
sw2709B-ms98-a-0076 575.661500 583.439000 and i wish that we could all just learn from each other and not feel threatened but it doesn't happen that way all the time
sw2709B-ms98-a-0077 583.439000 584.722625 [silence]
sw2709B-ms98-a-0078 584.722625 593.996125 so anyway it was good to talk to to you too and have a good trip in California all right well thank you bye-bye
sw2709B-ms98-a-0079 593.996125 596.741500 [noise]
