sw2700B-ms98-a-0003 2.300250 8.642500 uh well i'm kind of in the middle i lived in the Ozarks for a long time where a lot of people do a lot of hunting and uh
sw2700B-ms98-a-0004 8.642500 22.060000 now i live in Dallas where there's a lot of crime and i'm all for uh the average Joe being able to have a gun but then again i'm not you know as far as this seven day law and all this stuff for two weeks or whatever i'm all for that too i don't think anybody needs to be able to go buy a gun right away
sw2700B-ms98-a-0005 22.060000 25.536875 if you want a gun for a legitimate purpose you should be willing to wait
sw2700B-ms98-a-0006 25.536875 29.143875 long enough for someone to verify that you're not a
sw2700B-ms98-a-0007 29.143875 30.920750 a potential criminal
sw2700B-ms98-a-0008 30.920750 35.514000 [silence]
sw2700B-ms98-a-0009 35.514000 39.637500 yeah and i i don't think you know i think it's one of the constitutional rights that
sw2700B-ms98-a-0010 39.637500 44.411875 is important and you know we we should be allowed to have guns
sw2700B-ms98-a-0011 44.411875 49.748750 i don't think they should turn around and say you know the government says you can't have a gun because that just
sw2700B-ms98-a-0012 49.748750 51.209875 i don't know
sw2700B-ms98-a-0013 51.209875 52.947625 [silence]
sw2700B-ms98-a-0014 52.947625 61.124875 any any any country where they've ever revolted you know it takes guns to revolt and sure we don't need to but uh never know there might come a time
sw2700B-ms98-a-0015 61.124875 63.117250 so
sw2700B-ms98-a-0016 63.117250 90.629375 [silence]
sw2700B-ms98-a-0017 90.629375 100.020875 well they do that now i mean you're not supposed to have a hand guns well maybe you're allowed to have them say in the city but you're not allowed to use them in the city limits and things
sw2700B-ms98-a-0018 100.020875 113.271375 [silence]
sw2700B-ms98-a-0019 113.271375 117.839750 well what does that do to people that uh use it for protection like
sw2700B-ms98-a-0020 117.839750 128.410000 you know i personally i don't have a gun but i wouldn't mind having one i live in a neighborhood where the crime rate is going up somebody breaks in my house i wouldn't mind having a gun you know in self-defense but uh
sw2700B-ms98-a-0021 128.410000 152.138250 [silence]
sw2700B-ms98-a-0022 152.138250 161.562250 yeah yeah well i've never had it had to have one in the city you know when i was in the country we used them and out there was a necessity i mean you don't kill a copperhead with a rock
sw2700B-ms98-a-0023 161.562250 163.539750 you shoot them_1
sw2700B-ms98-a-0024 163.539750 164.988625 yeah
sw2700B-ms98-a-0025 164.988625 169.713500 [silence]
sw2700B-ms98-a-0026 169.713500 172.148875 i think there need to be stronger
sw2700B-ms98-a-0027 172.148875 175.331000 gun control laws that can be that can uh
sw2700B-ms98-a-0028 175.331000 176.341875 [silence]
sw2700B-ms98-a-0029 176.341875 181.190250 that uh what am i trying to say in in cities in urban areas
sw2700B-ms98-a-0030 181.190250 190.789250 but uh i don't think guns should be banned i just think it should be harder for for a criminal to get hold of them and of course the black market anyone can get one if they want one
sw2700B-ms98-a-0031 190.789250 196.391000 [silence]
sw2700B-ms98-a-0032 196.391000 200.144125 well that i guess that's the whole point of some of this legislation they're they're trying to make
sw2700B-ms98-a-0033 200.144125 203.172125 [silence]
sw2700B-ms98-a-0034 203.172125 209.947000 he turns around and yeah turns passes it on yeah there's no perfect answer
sw2700B-ms98-a-0035 209.947000 222.207125 but i guess i'm i'm more f[or]- i'm more for no i'm actually more for less control because i think it's it's a right that that i would hate to see us lose
sw2700B-ms98-a-0036 222.207125 227.590250 and the more the more you give gun control the little bit the little bit of time before long you don't have anything
sw2700B-ms98-a-0037 227.590250 232.466125 i mean i'm sure when they started out with taxes they didn't plan on taking thirty percent of your income but uh
sw2700B-ms98-a-0038 232.466125 234.921750 they just start with a little bit you know
sw2700B-ms98-a-0039 234.921750 252.784375 [silence]
sw2700B-ms98-a-0040 252.784375 258.147875 yeah i don't know what the deal is on that i know you can't buy them any more you can't can't buy imported ones anyway
sw2700B-ms98-a-0041 258.147875 260.420500 or is it the other way around
sw2700B-ms98-a-0042 260.420500 264.744625 [silence]
sw2700B-ms98-a-0043 264.744625 266.582375 right right
sw2700B-ms98-a-0044 266.582375 270.453625 [silence]
sw2700B-ms98-a-0045 270.453625 275.513250 i don't see any reason for anybody to have one unless they're fighting a war you know
sw2700B-ms98-a-0046 275.513250 279.457125 [silence]
sw2700B-ms98-a-0047 279.457125 281.577250 right right
sw2700B-ms98-a-0048 281.577250 300.308625 [silence]
sw2700B-ms98-a-0049 300.308625 301.687375 right
sw2700B-ms98-a-0050 301.687375 322.538500 [silence]
sw2700B-ms98-a-0051 322.538500 324.974875 yeah i wouldn't need an Uzi though [laughter]
sw2700B-ms98-a-0052 324.974875 327.152500 or a UB forty i mean a
sw2700B-ms98-a-0053 327.152500 330.994375 a pistol would be fine it's more for a scare tactic than anything else
sw2700B-ms98-a-0054 330.994375 335.959375 i don't really want to shoot somebody but i guess if uh it was me or him i would have to yeah
sw2700B-ms98-a-0055 335.959375 336.982375 [silence]
sw2700B-ms98-a-0056 336.982375 340.236250 course you've got people that are pulling them out on the highways down here
sw2700B-ms98-a-0057 340.236250 342.506750 it's like you cut them off and boom
sw2700B-ms98-a-0058 342.506750 344.576125 blow you away
sw2700B-ms98-a-0059 344.576125 347.678625 so you have to draw the line i guess
sw2700B-ms98-a-0060 347.678625 350.010500 i don't know
sw2700B-ms98-a-0061 350.010500 354.298000 so if we're supposed to pick a number i'd guess i'd pick oh what no gun control was
sw2700B-ms98-a-0062 354.298000 355.713750 was ten
sw2700B-ms98-a-0063 355.713750 359.544625 [silence]
sw2700B-ms98-a-0064 359.544625 361.859250 i guess i'd have to pick about an eight
sw2700B-ms98-a-0065 361.859250 364.297625 something down there toward the low end 
sw2700B-ms98-a-0066 364.297625 377.792500 [silence]
sw2700B-ms98-a-0067 377.792500 382.681750 well supposedly in seven days they're going they're going to look through your background and make sure you are not an ex-con or don't have
sw2700B-ms98-a-0068 382.681750 394.651250 [silence]
sw2700B-ms98-a-0069 394.651250 397.650625 yeah i don't either it might stop some people but
sw2700B-ms98-a-0070 397.650625 400.545375 some people with a history of something but uh
sw2700B-ms98-a-0071 400.545375 407.743875 you know i guess there's a lot of information out there on everybody whether we we believe it or not they know everything you've done for the last
sw2700B-ms98-a-0072 407.743875 410.774250 ever since you got a social security number really
sw2700B-ms98-a-0073 410.774250 415.826625 so uh i guess they've got some time to make sure you haven't been in prison or don't have a history of
sw2700B-ms98-a-0074 415.826625 417.706125 you know i don't know
sw2700B-ms98-a-0075 417.706125 420.771125 [silence]
sw2700B-ms98-a-0076 420.771125 424.478000 i don't know i really don't know what the the actual on how how they work that out
sw2700B-ms98-a-0077 424.478000 437.816500 i imagine with the the way everything is computerized now it won't take much you know a perspective buyer comes in and they throw in your social security number on some nationally network system and it based on whatever criteria it's got it says yes or no
sw2700B-ms98-a-0078 437.816500 443.700625 this guy can get a gun or he can't and whoever decides those criterias you know that's something the legislatures do 
sw2700B-ms98-a-0079 443.700625 448.607125 [silence]
sw2700B-ms98-a-0080 448.607125 450.137500 i really don't know
sw2700B-ms98-a-0081 450.137500 454.011500 i don't know what the you know what the status of those laws are
sw2700B-ms98-a-0082 454.011500 459.067000 [silence]
sw2700B-ms98-a-0083 459.067000 460.734625 yeah
sw2700B-ms98-a-0084 460.734625 463.967125 i would think if they're going to make a law it would have to be something uh
sw2700B-ms98-a-0085 463.967125 467.432750 it'd be a crime to uh not enforce it
sw2700B-ms98-a-0086 467.432750 468.694250 and
sw2700B-ms98-a-0087 468.694250 471.648000 [silence]
sw2700B-ms98-a-0088 471.648000 473.622375 all right uh 
sw2700B-ms98-a-0089 473.622375 475.749000 take care yeah bye
