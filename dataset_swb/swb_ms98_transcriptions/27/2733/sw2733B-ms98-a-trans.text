sw2733B-ms98-a-0003 9.067750 15.863125 oh my goodness well we're we're we're sort of sort of a General Motors family i guess that's the way we were raised
sw2733B-ms98-a-0004 15.863125 23.896750 and uh uh we were overseas for TI for a number of years and when we came back we suddenly find out we've got five licensed drivers in the family
sw2733B-ms98-a-0005 23.896750 34.443375 yeah [laughter] and four cars and we bought some year old cars from National Car Rental a[t]- at least two of them we bought an Olds Calais and a Buick Skylark
sw2733B-ms98-a-0006 34.443375 45.840625 uh for you know they each had twenty one thousand miles or something like that and turns out that's a pretty good place to buy cars because they maintain them_1 and they can show you the records they've gotten all their maintenance on schedule and everything like that
sw2733B-ms98-a-0007 45.840625 52.428500 uh then we've got an eighty six Chevy Spectrum that we bought new my daughter was a freshman in college when we bought it for her
sw2733B-ms98-a-0008 52.428500 59.975250 and we've got a eighty four Toyota that we bought used so we've got four cars for our five licensed drivers it's like musical [laughter-chairs]
sw2733B-ms98-a-0009 59.975250 72.362125 yeah one short [noise] and uh but you know it's interesting the two even though my dad uh was a Chevrolet man forever and ever ever and we were in the retail milk business and he had all Chevrolet milk trucks and
sw2733B-ms98-a-0010 72.362125 84.785625 and we bought automobiles and all that and it was almost like and a Chevrolet dealer was our friend and it was almost like the minute we got old and bought anything like a but a Chevrolet it'd be like going and spitting on his grave [laughter] but uh
sw2733B-ms98-a-0011 84.785625 97.529500 and we got older and got away and then we thought well you know you still could buy General Motors products and it was probably not that bad but uh we lived in Malaysia for TI in nineteen uh eighty one two three and four
sw2733B-ms98-a-0012 97.529500 108.384875 [noise] and of course you don't buy General Motors products [laughter-over] [laughter-there] but we bought a Volvo and i have never had a car that i've loved more i just can't afford them_1 here uh but i- i just loved that car
sw2733B-ms98-a-0013 108.384875 122.640625 and uh we bought a uh we lived in the Philippines for TI in eighty five eighty six and eighty seven and we bought a uh Ford Telstar which is somewhat similar to the Taurus it's sold in the in uh the Far Eastern coun[tries]- Far East countries more
sw2733B-ms98-a-0014 122.640625 128.184750 then here but we really liked that and have you had experience with cars other than the ones you've had [noise]

sw2733B-ms98-a-0037 193.235000 196.323250 yeah yeah it seems that something goes every month
sw2733B-ms98-a-0038 196.323250 210.135875 and i'm afraid we're gonna be in that in another year with all of ours you know we got three eighty sixes and an eighty [laughter-four] and we'll probably be there with all of them_1 you know it's the same thing you know i don't know whether you uh classify the Skylark and the Calais as small i guess they're intermediates
sw2733B-ms98-a-0039 210.135875 217.787125 uh but uh we went on a family trip to Massachusetts and there were five of us and uh five five of us never go anywhere together here
sw2733B-ms98-a-0040 217.787125 222.885000 everyb[ody]- everybody's heading off in their own direction [noise] and i rented a Buick Le Sabre
sw2733B-ms98-a-0041 222.885000 233.429125 and it's the first big car i had since i had my nine passenger Impala station wagon from seventy six to eighty [noise] and it made all the i- i had forgotten what driving a big car was like
sw2733B-ms98-a-0042 233.429125 236.139500 it was just nice it floated
sw2733B-ms98-a-0043 236.139500 240.618250 [silence]
sw2733B-ms98-a-0044 240.618250 242.560500 oh yeah
sw2733B-ms98-a-0045 242.560500 244.628250 yeah
sw2733B-ms98-a-0046 244.628250 246.602125 yeah yeah and
sw2733B-ms98-a-0047 246.602125 260.064625 and uh you know i've read i'm in the quality business at TI i'm a quality manager and we're we're uh we deal we sell i'm in the semiconductor group and we sell to uh Ford Chrysler and GM uh GM Delco
sw2733B-ms98-a-0048 260.064625 273.907875 and there is a amazing i am just uh really impressed with the with the quality consciousness that the[se]- tho[se]- these companies have put into their procurement and it's [vocalized-noise] uh it's come about as a result of the competition from the Japanese
sw2733B-ms98-a-0049 273.907875 279.955875 and uh uh i and you know we used to think Ford products were tinny i mean i was growing up
sw2733B-ms98-a-0050 279.955875 290.639875 i was taught that when i was growing up you know [laughter-that] [laughter-that] [laughter-that] real people bought General Motors products [laughter-and] [laughter-you] [laughter-know] [laughter-and] peons bought Ford products but just with the quality requirements
sw2733B-ms98-a-0051 290.639875 295.297375 that Ford is putting on us and the way they come into our plants and they're really
sw2733B-ms98-a-0052 295.297375 308.573250 uh uh stressing this partnerships in quality and you know GM and Chrysler are doing that but i really think Ford's got a leadersh[ip]- -[leader]ship position in this right now and i think it's showing up in their automobiles their automobiles are getting a very good quality reputation right now
sw2733B-ms98-a-0053 308.573250 318.162250 and uh uh we went to uh Austin a while back to a basketball tournament and we were gonna be meeting some of my wife's relatives down there so we decided rather than drive one of our cars down we'd rent
sw2733B-ms98-a-0054 318.162250 326.603250 one and we went up to the local Budget and we were gonna get a Olds Eighty Eight or something he said i'll tell you what for a dollar a day more i'll give you a Lincoln Towncar
sw2733B-ms98-a-0055 326.603250 336.319875 and we drove that down and i hated to turn that back in when we got back we had that for three days and i absolutely lo[ved]- except i wouldn't wanna have to park it in tight places all the time
sw2733B-ms98-a-0056 336.319875 347.265375 uh but i absolutely loved that automobile [noise] and you know it wasn't that i'd driving around down there we might have got sixteen to eighteen miles per gallon but on the trip down and back i filled up
sw2733B-ms98-a-0057 347.265375 351.911500 both coming and going so i knew what i actually got on the trip and it was about twenty four miles a gallon
sw2733B-ms98-a-0058 351.911500 357.880375 uh and you know we just got it out on the highway and put it in cruise control at about sixty and let it let it float
sw2733B-ms98-a-0059 357.880375 363.549125 and it was pretty nice are y[ou]- are you are you planning on getting any additional or other cars
sw2733B-ms98-a-0060 363.549125 369.477250 [silence]
sw2733B-ms98-a-0061 369.477250 373.949375 hm oh yeah yours is small [laughter]
sw2733B-ms98-a-0062 373.949375 380.603500 [silence]
sw2733B-ms98-a-0063 380.603500 382.487875 um-hum
sw2733B-ms98-a-0064 382.487875 388.351250 oh yeah yeah you probably got another another thirty or forty thousand if you maintain them_1 uh
sw2733B-ms98-a-0065 388.351250 396.519375 we've got probably we'll get something in the next couple years my son will graduate from high school this year and and he's gonna go to Richland College one year behind us
sw2733B-ms98-a-0066 396.519375 409.721125 it's right you know in fact our house is a[djacent]- adjacent to the Richland property he wants to go to Texas Tech and he's probably gonna have to go to Richland a year to get some grades in order [noise] but uh the next year when he goes out to Tech he wants a pickup
sw2733B-ms98-a-0067 409.721125 417.023125 and i want a pickup i may get one and not let him have [laughter-it] but we have been looking at these red Chevro[let]- they they're very popular around here
sw2733B-ms98-a-0068 417.023125 425.274875 these uh r[ed]- uh red Chevy pickups and uh we'll probably do something like that uh uh incidentally uh
sw2733B-ms98-a-0069 425.274875 435.834125 uh i don't know uh the uh the credit union has got a deal now where you decide what you want and you call this number [noise] and uh they go negotiate the price for you
sw2733B-ms98-a-0070 435.834125 440.494250 and and or or send you to a guy with whom they've already got a deal
sw2733B-ms98-a-0071 440.494250 447.612125 and uh my boss just bought a Chevy pickup and he got three thousand dollars off the sticker price doing it this way
sw2733B-ms98-a-0072 447.612125 461.786625 yeah and uh uh you know you you figure out the options go around look at the dealers and get the best price you can and then go call this guy and and tell him what you want and he'll put you in touch with a certain guy a certain person at that dealer's place
sw2733B-ms98-a-0073 461.786625 464.121375 so i'm gonna try that the next time i buy one
sw2733B-ms98-a-0074 464.121375 473.740375 and and so you know i can go around and comparison shop and see if i can get a better negotiation on my own but [noise] once uh one thing that's a pain in the neck buying automobiles is negotiating
sw2733B-ms98-a-0075 473.740375 475.486500 yeah
sw2733B-ms98-a-0076 475.486500 480.092500 [silence]
sw2733B-ms98-a-0077 480.092500 481.537500 yeah
sw2733B-ms98-a-0078 481.537500 482.900750 [silence]
sw2733B-ms98-a-0079 482.900750 484.786625 and for that price
sw2733B-ms98-a-0080 484.786625 492.043250 [silence]
sw2733B-ms98-a-0081 492.043250 494.448000 we'll go somewhere else yeah
sw2733B-ms98-a-0082 494.448000 495.824000 [silence]
sw2733B-ms98-a-0083 495.824000 501.293250 yeah and uh and i- i think that's probably the way you got to do it when when i was young
sw2733B-ms98-a-0084 501.293250 510.669875 i went in and bought a uh or made a deal on a sixty this is nineteen sixty i'd first come to Texas and made a deal on a sixty red Impala convertible
sw2733B-ms98-a-0085 510.669875 521.068250 that i just loved and this guy gave me this deal you know i told how much i wanted to pay [noise] and for every fifty dollars he'd have to go in and check with the boss and then i'd have to sign something saying that if he could get this rate
sw2733B-ms98-a-0086 521.068250 532.574125 uh we would go ahead and buy uh uh if he could get this rate i promised to buy and i left there on a Saturday afternoon just totally exhausted i- i was only twenty five years old or something [noise] and i- i left there and i
sw2733B-ms98-a-0087 532.574125 540.650625 i uh i'd never done this before because_1 i'd always bought my previous cars from the guy my dad bought his milk trucks from [noise] and uh uh so
sw2733B-ms98-a-0088 540.650625 552.679250 i- i got back and a salesman that lived in the apartment i did asked me uh uh if he'd heard i was gonna get a car and asked me what i paid for it he said well hey uh before you go buying anything he says call this friend of mine at Will's Point
sw2733B-ms98-a-0089 552.679250 557.899250 it was a guy that owned a Chevrolet dealership up there [noise] and i called the guy and made an appointment to come up Monday morning
sw2733B-ms98-a-0090 557.899250 568.887125 and just driving fifty miles out of town it was a difference and i mean it was a difference of four hundred dollars but this was four hundred dollars on only twenty five hundred is all we paid for cars in those days [noise] and uh
sw2733B-ms98-a-0091 568.887125 579.001000 uh so i called back the guy in Dallas and i told him that i'd left him a check for tax title and license and everything [noise] and i said i wanna cancel my order and and don't try to cash the check because_1 i'm gonna i've stopped payment on it already
sw2733B-ms98-a-0092 579.001000 586.138875 and he says oh somebody's taking he said what did you get a deal for Bill and i told him he says somebody's taking you for a ride and i said no somebody took me for a [laughter-ride]
sw2733B-ms98-a-0093 586.138875 600.632750 last [laughter-Saturday] and uh uh and i- i find that uh and for the longest time then i drove up to Will's Point and the and the and the fellow died since then and and some of his relatives taken over the business a[nd]- but and since then i hadn't real[ly]-
