sw2716B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 4.134875 [silence]
sw2716B-ms98-a-0002 4.134875 9.579000 yeah i think it's probably a good idea um i think given that um
sw2716B-ms98-a-0003 9.579000 14.412375 well given that there're so many people who don't have health insurance it's probably a real
sw2716B-ms98-a-0004 14.412375 20.614000 smart thing that at least have some basic coverage for everyone i mean you hear these horror stories of people [noise]
sw2716B-ms98-a-0005 20.614000 27.645500 homeless people going to the hospital and and being thrown out because they have no insurance and having to go to someplace else you know it would be nice if
sw2716B-ms98-a-0006 27.645500 35.849375 no matter where you are or who you are or what happened you know what happened to you you go to the hospital and they say okay just just take him don't worry about you know who or what he is later so 
sw2716B-ms98-a-0007 35.849375 37.538500 that would be a nice thing
sw2716B-ms98-a-0008 37.538500 52.824875 [silence]
sw2716B-ms98-a-0009 52.824875 62.853250 yeah no that that is certainly true but i wonder about like like in Canada in Canada where everybody everybody um automatically has insurance in Canada 
sw2716B-ms98-a-0010 62.853250 79.410125 [silence]
sw2716B-ms98-a-0011 79.410125 80.569625 yeah
sw2716B-ms98-a-0012 80.569625 85.799625 [silence]
sw2716B-ms98-a-0013 85.799625 88.396750 that's true that's something i haven't thought about
sw2716B-ms98-a-0014 88.396750 92.446250 [silence]
sw2716B-ms98-a-0015 92.446250 94.943750 that's true that's true
sw2716B-ms98-a-0016 94.943750 103.308625 [silence]
sw2716B-ms98-a-0017 103.308625 105.908750 no oh so you don't get any choices at all or any[thing]-
sw2716B-ms98-a-0018 105.908750 109.303375 oh that's a problem yeah because_1 i i mean i know i even
sw2716B-ms98-a-0019 109.303375 112.865375 even among you know ev[en]- even now the way we have it now there's
sw2716B-ms98-a-0020 112.865375 114.703875 there are some pla[ces]-
sw2716B-ms98-a-0021 114.703875 116.187000 yeah i mean like
sw2716B-ms98-a-0022 116.187000 119.587125 we have an an HMO that allows us to pick our own physicians
sw2716B-ms98-a-0023 119.587125 123.061625 and we picked a primary care physician and just didn't like him you know and
sw2716B-ms98-a-0024 123.061625 126.197625 and had to switch because_1 i felt he was a quack [laughter-so] 
sw2716B-ms98-a-0025 126.197625 134.088875 [silence]
sw2716B-ms98-a-0026 134.088875 135.199750 yeah
sw2716B-ms98-a-0027 135.199750 136.545375 [silence]
sw2716B-ms98-a-0028 136.545375 141.741625 yeah that is the extreme and what what that i what that i think tends to do though is i think that tends to
sw2716B-ms98-a-0029 141.741625 153.595125 that probably has two a a good and a bad side for young people wanting to become doctors i mean what you get is other people who are motivated to be because_1 the money isn't i guess as much for doctors anymore so they would wind up getting
sw2716B-ms98-a-0030 153.595125 164.662500 the people who really want to be doctors being doctors but then again you know you don't get those people who'd be good and are real smart and decided hey i i wanna make a lot of money so i will go into medicine you know you don't get those
sw2716B-ms98-a-0031 164.662500 179.319875 [silence]
sw2716B-ms98-a-0032 179.319875 181.694250 yeah that's true
sw2716B-ms98-a-0033 181.694250 185.405250 [silence]
sw2716B-ms98-a-0034 185.405250 189.112750 yeah and it would be nice to to see something where at least 
sw2716B-ms98-a-0035 189.112750 190.638250 [silence]
sw2716B-ms98-a-0036 190.638250 200.332750 right i mean even something that said you know look free major medical to all you know to everyone and then beyond that you sort of work out on your own if if you want 
sw2716B-ms98-a-0037 200.332750 206.562500 [silence]
sw2716B-ms98-a-0038 206.562500 207.767125 uh-huh
sw2716B-ms98-a-0039 207.767125 211.254875 [silence]
sw2716B-ms98-a-0040 211.254875 212.593875 oh yeah
sw2716B-ms98-a-0041 212.593875 218.256375 [silence]
sw2716B-ms98-a-0042 218.256375 219.694125 oh right no
sw2716B-ms98-a-0043 219.694125 223.062250 [silence]
sw2716B-ms98-a-0044 223.062250 232.639875 yeah they're the ones who make i mean they're the ones they have you know [vocalized-noise] although i mean it's the unfortunate part of that is that is that people i think tend to forget that doctors are humans as well 
sw2716B-ms98-a-0045 232.639875 239.788000 so that so that you know insurance companies have to charge a substantial amount for certain people or certain phys[ician]- types of of of doctors 
sw2716B-ms98-a-0046 239.788000 254.299125 given that you know someone decides to have a malpractice suit against them well they could take you know it could be millions i mean unfortunately and and if the doctor whether it was you know i mean i'm sure there're those cases where the doctor was wrong or malicious or something you know but there are you know i mean 
sw2716B-ms98-a-0047 254.299125 264.157875 mistakes you know everybody makes mistakes unfortunately and and it shouldn't be a billion dollar you know industry it should be i made a mistake and this is this is fair compensation not
sw2716B-ms98-a-0048 264.157875 265.194125 [silence]
sw2716B-ms98-a-0049 265.194125 267.189250 yeah that is a big problem
sw2716B-ms98-a-0050 267.189250 270.185750 [silence]
sw2716B-ms98-a-0051 270.185750 271.187875 that'd be nice
sw2716B-ms98-a-0052 271.187875 280.108375 [silence]
sw2716B-ms98-a-0053 280.108375 291.533625 uh-huh it would be a lot better yeah and i'm sort of in a in a government run medicine program sort of i'm i'm in a well well i'm a graduate student at and uh
sw2716B-ms98-a-0054 291.533625 300.368875 at University of Rochester in Rochester New York i'll bet you're in Texas up yeah i was gonna bet that okay um
sw2716B-ms98-a-0055 300.368875 308.055125 yeah and as as it turns out my wife has pretty decent coverage through her company and can get me covered as well
sw2716B-ms98-a-0056 308.055125 318.236875 but uh which is great ex[cept]- and because the univer[sity]- but the university offers two plans they offer what they call the mandatory portion which is basically major medical and then they offer the waiveable portion
sw2716B-ms98-a-0057 318.236875 326.285875 which is which is you know ev[ery]- you know sort of everything else you need so your your your your basic care beyond major medical separate stuff
sw2716B-ms98-a-0058 326.285875 338.599500 and they don't and even though my my wife's insurance covers me for everything i still have to pay them a hundred some odd dollars a semester for the mandatory portion of the insurance
sw2716B-ms98-a-0059 338.599500 348.070625 yeah i'm not actually sure it is or not but no one people keep sort of fighting it and i'm and i keep meaning to fight it but you know it just one of these things where i don't want to spend my time 
sw2716B-ms98-a-0060 348.070625 357.469500 well the reason the i mean their rational is is they make everyone pay for it so that it it keeps the cost of university health services down
sw2716B-ms98-a-0061 357.469500 359.402250 and everyone can use it you know it
sw2716B-ms98-a-0062 359.402250 360.457375 [silence]
sw2716B-ms98-a-0063 360.457375 362.669875 because everyone is now forced to pay for this
sw2716B-ms98-a-0064 362.669875 363.888125 and there's like a
sw2716B-ms98-a-0065 363.888125 365.659000 [silence]
sw2716B-ms98-a-0066 365.659000 376.710625 uh well no what yeah well what they used it no they what they use it for is is is university health services we have a we have a hospital here and a s[ubportion]- a subportion of the hospital was [vocalized-noise] 
sw2716B-ms98-a-0067 376.710625 389.124000 right so i'm basically paying for a welfare state now as it turns out as it turns out um my wife and i have chosen to use the university as health services as out primary care phy[sician]- we can do that
sw2716B-ms98-a-0068 389.124000 394.771000 so in in but in effect i am pay twice for one service so 
sw2716B-ms98-a-0069 394.771000 411.142125 [silence]
sw2716B-ms98-a-0070 411.142125 412.657250 uh-hum
sw2716B-ms98-a-0071 412.657250 422.115750 [silence]
sw2716B-ms98-a-0072 422.115750 426.292500 yeah yeah
sw2716B-ms98-a-0073 426.292500 437.774750 [silence]
sw2716B-ms98-a-0074 437.774750 441.063250 yeah well that's that's certain true
sw2716B-ms98-a-0075 441.063250 455.793000 [silence]
sw2716B-ms98-a-0076 455.793000 457.936625 right which is ridiculous
sw2716B-ms98-a-0077 457.936625 466.661500 [silence]
sw2716B-ms98-a-0078 466.661500 467.618375 yeah
sw2716B-ms98-a-0079 467.618375 478.516125 [silence]
sw2716B-ms98-a-0080 478.516125 480.285375 everybody else
sw2716B-ms98-a-0081 480.285375 487.912625 [silence]
sw2716B-ms98-a-0082 487.912625 489.559375 right

sw2716B-ms98-a-0084 499.951000 503.136375 exactly i don't i don't uh
sw2716B-ms98-a-0085 503.136375 512.241375 [silence]
sw2716B-ms98-a-0086 512.241375 521.461250 uh-huh yeah it's it's one of the st[range]- i i think it's strange is that as you get older i i i think the tendency is that as people get older 
sw2716B-ms98-a-0087 521.461250 531.637875 and gain i don't i don't i don't want to say more responsibilities but you know things like homes and kids and so forth they tend to lose that liberalism they had when they were younger
sw2716B-ms98-a-0088 531.637875 544.625250 [silence]
sw2716B-ms98-a-0089 544.625250 548.166500 [laughter] that is probably very true
sw2716B-ms98-a-0090 548.166500 565.925375 [silence]
sw2716B-ms98-a-0091 565.925375 576.822875 no i i th[ink]- think people are starting to really mean it i mean everywhere you look you're getting something new i mean you start off you know especially um you guys i believe in Texas you don't have state tax do you
sw2716B-ms98-a-0092 576.822875 591.030000 right we have we have federal income tax state income tax local income tax we have state tax on gasoline um you know because_1 our our you know so on top of the federal tax on gasoline we have state tax on gasoline so we're just 
sw2716B-ms98-a-0093 591.030000 595.092500 [silence]
sw2716B-ms98-a-0094 595.092500 597.700500 or that could be yeah making up for the difference
sw2716B-ms98-a-0095 597.700500 599.907250 [silence]
