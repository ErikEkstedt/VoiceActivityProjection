sw2716A-ms98-a-0010 34.089000 43.179250 yeah yeah yeah i feel like there should be some kind coverage made but i i am really leery of um [noise]
sw2716A-ms98-a-0011 43.179250 55.057500 kind of a government administrative health insurance or medical plan because i just feel like everything the government takes over is just going to be run much poorly and it's going to be about six times more expensive as what 
sw2716A-ms98-a-0012 55.057500 58.614125 yeah uh-huh
sw2716A-ms98-a-0013 58.614125 61.910000 [silence]
sw2716A-ms98-a-0014 61.910000 71.106500 right and they have that in England too but i think it is a pretty p[oor]- they get a lot lower quality care than we do now i know that some people don't agree with me but
sw2716A-ms98-a-0015 71.106500 79.717500 um i know you have to wait real long time to get for certain surgeries that aren't emergencies and you do have the kind of choices that we have here
sw2716A-ms98-a-0016 79.717500 86.131500 and um i've worked a lot in doctor's offices and hospitals and i really don't want to give up having those choices
sw2716A-ms98-a-0017 86.131500 93.279375 because_1 i think i mean there is a night and day difference between good doctors and bad doctors and good hospitals and bad do[ctors]- hospitals and
sw2716A-ms98-a-0018 93.279375 104.154625 and in England at least at the time i was familiar with it about ten years ago they just told you what day you had to show up and where you had to show up and who your doctor was going to be
sw2716A-ms98-a-0019 104.154625 108.171500 no no i mean that yeah

sw2716A-ms98-a-0025 125.407250 139.831625 right that's exactly the problem there's just so many such variation in it but you see i guess wh[at]- what they had in England and i guess in Canada is socialized medicine so maybe that's like the extreme of it do you think yeah 
sw2716A-ms98-a-0026 139.831625 143.766750 [silence]

sw2716A-ms98-a-0033 162.452250 171.611625 right or that yeah exactly or people also get the feeling that well geez you know you do have to worry about you have a lot of job security there
sw2716A-ms98-a-0034 171.611625 184.542625 and it's more of a seniority i would imagine kind of thing instead of having a skill or or whatever to advance and so you don't necessarily get the kind of quality control or the kind of 
sw2716A-ms98-a-0035 184.542625 191.859250 i don't know [laughter] [vocalized-noise] i think we have to have something i really do

sw2716A-ms98-a-0038 198.781125 207.341250 yeah i know i i don't know i [vocalized-noise] i've having worked in doctor's offices and stuff i see it from a physician's point of view and i
sw2716A-ms98-a-0039 207.341250 213.812250 i think the problem with the skyrocketing costs right now is the insurance companies because_1 i don't see doctors getting all rich
sw2716A-ms98-a-0040 213.812250 224.386625 and i think hospitals do make money but not nearly as much as insurance companies do i think they are really making a killing and nobody's talking about it nobody's

sw2716A-ms98-a-0047 261.967000 270.449875 so is i gue[ss]- yeah i think that's the legal part it coming in to too that i wonder if we should have a limit on how much people can sue for
sw2716A-ms98-a-0048 270.449875 280.705875 or [laughter] or i don't know because then that's where the insurance company ben[efits]- if if people weren't having to spend these huge amounts of money on getting insurance coverage
sw2716A-ms98-a-0049 280.705875 283.925250 you know yeah

sw2716A-ms98-a-0083 391.895625 393.038625 you are
sw2716A-ms98-a-0084 393.038625 400.242375 you are i know and see that's the thing that is the thing now that i'm in my thirties now and i have three kids and i'm
sw2716A-ms98-a-0085 400.242375 404.389875 i mean i'm very liberal i'm extremely liberal and um
sw2716A-ms98-a-0086 404.389875 411.523375 and i s[ay]- but now i just in the last couple years i have gotten to the point where i am saying i just can not afford to pay any more 
sw2716A-ms98-a-0087 411.523375 420.123625 to help people out i i wanna keep helping people out but i need the f[ederal]- for the government or the agencies to find a way to do it on
sw2716A-ms98-a-0088 420.123625 427.939000 the amount of money [laughter] you know that i can afford i just can't afford any more it's it's out it's just outrageously
sw2716A-ms98-a-0089 427.939000 433.092625 it's just starting to get me angry and for the first time in my life i'm starting to feel like i [vocalized-noise]
sw2716A-ms98-a-0090 433.092625 439.788875 [vocalized-noise] well i guess it has a lot to do with a lot of the stuff that i find out that i'm paying for [laughter-now] you know 
sw2716A-ms98-a-0091 439.788875 445.403500 i mean i can't afford to have some kind of some kind of volun[tary]- optional operation for myself
sw2716A-ms98-a-0092 445.403500 456.169625 because our our medical coverage has gotten increasingly worse over say the past five years to the point now where even if we need surgery our insurance only covers eighty percent of it
sw2716A-ms98-a-0093 456.169625 469.882250 and right and so no matter what happens to me if i get in to a car accident this afternoon i have no i[dea]- you know [laughter] no way of being able to afford the outrageous medical cost because my insurance is now only eighty percent of what ever it's going to be
sw2716A-ms98-a-0094 469.882250 478.907875 and um so on top of that um then what if i [vocalized-noise] what if we decide to have universal health insurance so i am subsidizing
sw2716A-ms98-a-0095 478.907875 489.996750 and and what if they are lucky enough to get into a doctor and a program that's going to say okay well you really need to have those varicose veins or fixed or your teeth fixed or something like that and i'm paying for it
sw2716A-ms98-a-0096 489.996750 501.817000 you know i[t]- stuff like that has happened with education and other things that you hear about and it's just wait a minute [laughter] you know my kids aren't getting that how come their k[ids]- kids are getting [laughter]
sw2716A-ms98-a-0097 501.817000 513.277625 and and i know that it's only in a few cases and i don't want them t[o]- to uh cut funding for welfare programs or anything i don't want them to do that because_1 i know a lot of people they live right on the edge and they need that
sw2716A-ms98-a-0098 513.277625 515.794250 but but i [vocalized-noise]

sw2716A-ms98-a-0106 530.189250 544.731250 well yeah that's and it's uh it's funny because_1 a couple years ago i hear a [vocalized-noise] quote from Winston Churchill let's see if i can remember it anybody who's not a liberal in his twenties has no heart and a person who's not a conservative in his fifties has no brain
sw2716A-ms98-a-0107 544.731250 550.620250 it was something like [laughter-that] [laughter] yeah and uh
sw2716A-ms98-a-0108 550.620250 556.979375 i don't know i guess that's what's happening to me but i i i think it's just starting um its
sw2716A-ms98-a-0109 556.979375 567.013750 i i don't know maybe other people i do you think it's a sign of the times that people are starting to say alright really we really mean it no more [laughter-taxes] or maybe is it just my own personal
