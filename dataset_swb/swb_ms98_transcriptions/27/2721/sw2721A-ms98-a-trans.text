sw2721A-ms98-a-0004 35.497625 45.935375 [noise] yeah i think um [noise] i i'm a i'm an advocate of uh gun control [laughter] um Maryland i think you'd be surprised is is very pro gun control [noise]
sw2721A-ms98-a-0005 45.935375 55.263625 yeah as a state in fact we have um they're now introducing some of the more [noise] most restrictive gun control laws here in Maryland and uh the um
sw2721A-ms98-a-0006 55.263625 67.173625 [noise] NRA did a na[tionwide]- nationwide campaign to raise money to defeat uh Maryland's um [noise] local state laws and lost Maryland uh
sw2721A-ms98-a-0007 67.173625 77.435625 voted in favor to have g[un]- gun control here i think the problem is is because of um [noise] we have there's so much crime in the adjoining community of Washington DC
sw2721A-ms98-a-0008 77.435625 89.758000 that um we're hoping that they could you know if they put in more stricter laws then that crime won't reach out into Maryland which is in a sense a suburb of that um [noise] i guess they're experiencing now
sw2721A-ms98-a-0009 89.758000 103.237375 i don't know two murders or three murders a day in Washington DC normally associated with automatic weapons so i think that's the um [noise] that's the big press up in the Northeast is that they want to remove automatic weapons
sw2721A-ms98-a-0010 103.237375 109.797875 [noise] so yeah i can understand you know guns for and we everybody else in Maryland supports that and hope[fully]- and hope[fully]-
sw2721A-ms98-a-0011 109.797875 110.912250 [silence]
sw2721A-ms98-a-0012 110.912250 112.105375 yeah
sw2721A-ms98-a-0013 112.105375 113.520000 [silence]
sw2721A-ms98-a-0014 113.520000 117.108625 [noise] yeah i- i think what you'll find though is that the East Coast is very
sw2721A-ms98-a-0015 117.108625 119.857500 uh is pro gun control
sw2721A-ms98-a-0016 119.857500 128.427750 i know i am but like you know you're a hunter and you're a sport you're a sport hunter that's true and and that that's why you know in a sense
sw2721A-ms98-a-0017 128.427750 139.875000 how it doesn't it does inconvenience you but it could save lives i think is the way we look at it here and we're seeing so many murders um [noise] between uh in in Washington DC
sw2721A-ms98-a-0018 139.875000 146.039625 [silence]
sw2721A-ms98-a-0019 146.039625 149.699625 well i think the i think the long run is is to get um
sw2721A-ms98-a-0020 149.699625 164.480000 is to get and this is very active in the po[litics]- politics here in Maryland now then [noise] the long run there's also there's a bill being trying to be passed right now i guess through fe[deral]- the federal legislature on um [noise] instant checkups a a total computerized system
sw2721A-ms98-a-0021 164.480000 166.423500 [silence]
sw2721A-ms98-a-0022 166.423500 170.107250 right and it's year it's years away but i[t]- it will be
sw2721A-ms98-a-0023 170.107250 182.548375 it probably will be implemented on the East Coast first because the FBI headquarters is here in in Virginia and the this will probably be the places that will start to come in faster so yeah it will take a while before um
sw2721A-ms98-a-0024 182.548375 197.109125 it comes in but that's one reason why i guess the the plan is here in Maryland um because_1 i actually just received uh information from my um uh the um Brady Organization that um they want this seven day bill passed until
sw2721A-ms98-a-0025 197.109125 209.002125 the um [noise] the new bill until they can actually have a computerized system and i think the idea of the Brady Bill is to have this seven day waiting period to be able to check up on gun purchases or whatever
sw2721A-ms98-a-0026 209.002125 213.948875 um until they can do it automatically on a large computerized system [noise]
sw2721A-ms98-a-0027 213.948875 217.690000 [silence]
sw2721A-ms98-a-0028 217.690000 219.367375 oh sure [noise] that's
sw2721A-ms98-a-0029 219.367375 224.543750 [silence]
sw2721A-ms98-a-0030 224.543750 231.730000 that's true but he had uh he had a history of of depression and and suicidal behavior you know
sw2721A-ms98-a-0031 231.730000 234.012875 [silence]
sw2721A-ms98-a-0032 234.012875 235.031500 um-hum

sw2721A-ms98-a-0036 239.980750 249.037250 well i don't think he would have been i think that his his type of crime i don't i don't think he would have been i think a street criminal would be you know like what you find in Washington DC
sw2721A-ms98-a-0037 249.037250 257.836625 they would be capable of doing it i don't think this fellow would have i think i think the idea is that they also um my idea too is to remove the automatic weapons from
sw2721A-ms98-a-0038 257.836625 263.491250 from the markets you know not to be able to purchase walk into a store and buy an automatic weapon [noise]

sw2721A-ms98-a-0042 268.341125 273.888750 it'll it'll eliminate some of the you know that that type of crime or whatever yeah and
sw2721A-ms98-a-0043 273.888750 274.902000 [silence]
sw2721A-ms98-a-0044 274.902000 277.712500 right you can do anything yeah and i- i think that's
sw2721A-ms98-a-0045 277.712500 284.584000 you know in a sense uh i have friends that are peace activists and i'm not that extreme Everything they think that everything comes down to
sw2721A-ms98-a-0046 284.584000 294.244500 you know the whole world but i just think that right now we should do a little bit better checking and and um and i- i believe totally that automatic weapons should not be sold in this country
sw2721A-ms98-a-0047 294.244500 301.391375 um those are you know paramilitary i don't think even sport you know do you know anybody that sport hunts with a automatic weapon
sw2721A-ms98-a-0048 301.391375 315.402000 see and i don't either so and i do have friends my brother is a lifelong member of the NRA [laughter] so it's fun you know it's um but it's just a belief you know i guess we all work towards um what we think will make it a better society
sw2721A-ms98-a-0049 315.402000 320.968500 um-hum [noise] and everybody's differences of opinion are probably good that's what makes our you know
sw2721A-ms98-a-0050 320.968500 322.063500 [silence]
sw2721A-ms98-a-0051 322.063500 323.537250 yeah
sw2721A-ms98-a-0052 323.537250 339.012000 [silence]
sw2721A-ms98-a-0053 339.012000 353.805875 no but it's a start i think i think what you i guess you have to look at things almost just like the i guess the like the pro life and pro choice is that you start with something and if you accomplish it then you increase your objectives and and you move to the next
sw2721A-ms98-a-0054 353.805875 356.144625 yeah you can't do it all at once
sw2721A-ms98-a-0055 356.144625 370.814250 yeah so once if you can um i guess if you can show the put a seven day waiting period in you can mobilize for that then you can also um [noise] uh if you show the weakness in the NRA which is a big lobby you know hopefully you can show enough weakness
sw2721A-ms98-a-0056 370.814250 382.861875 um from the the the gun control advocates you can show enough weakness that you can you know [vocalized-noise] get the President to put a total ban on on assault weapons or the legislatures you know
sw2721A-ms98-a-0057 382.861875 387.021375 [silence]
sw2721A-ms98-a-0058 387.021375 390.022875 yeah well that's [vocalized-noise] yeah
sw2721A-ms98-a-0059 390.022875 391.732750 um-hum
sw2721A-ms98-a-0060 391.732750 393.205500 [silence]
sw2721A-ms98-a-0061 393.205500 408.156250 right yeah and see now and if it doesn't work i would be the first one to say you know just like prohibition didn't work if it doesn't work i think i'd be one of the first ones to say okay you know it hasn't worked in five years it hasn't reduced any crime the statistics still show the same so
sw2721A-ms98-a-0062 408.156250 415.062375 [silence]
sw2721A-ms98-a-0063 415.062375 416.711000 um-hum

sw2721A-ms98-a-0065 418.369375 420.877375 [silence]
sw2721A-ms98-a-0066 420.877375 427.272375 well see you already registered i think the idea is to get a better idea of who purchases guns um
sw2721A-ms98-a-0067 427.272375 440.871000 what type of person purchases what type of of gun and and and also you know the idea that somebody can go out you know a lot of the the mass murderers you know like that one fellow that walked into the Post Office purchased he was severely depressed
sw2721A-ms98-a-0068 440.871000 454.932750 um from he'd just lost his job um the he was severely depressed he'd been taking depressant drugs or whatever and he walked into a a store bought automatic weapons bought bullets drove immediately back to the Post Office and shot his former
sw2721A-ms98-a-0069 454.932750 466.303875 uh supervisor you know and i think the idea is if you put a seven day waiting period on some of these instant crimes you know this fellow may seek help before he murders you know ideas like that
sw2721A-ms98-a-0070 466.303875 475.136000 [noise] and you know in in all honesty i think all of us believe that uh that um [noise] uh you know people kill guns don't
sw2721A-ms98-a-0071 475.136000 481.389750 you know that i- i think but the idea is to is the the compulsive neurotic by gun killer
sw2721A-ms98-a-0072 481.389750 483.827375 [silence]
sw2721A-ms98-a-0073 483.827375 488.539875 there there are and and they always take a number of people with them [noise] so i

sw2721A-ms98-a-0075 489.746500 492.007875 [silence]
sw2721A-ms98-a-0076 492.007875 505.299750 yeah see and in the back of my mind if we save one life if if you save one life you have to wait seven days probably less because if you have a clean record it probably would be faster than seven days you know but you have to wait seven
sw2721A-ms98-a-0077 505.299750 506.773625 you have to wait
sw2721A-ms98-a-0078 506.773625 514.512750 [silence]
sw2721A-ms98-a-0079 514.512750 518.221250 [noise] oh they probably wouldn't not yet they probably wouldn't

sw2721A-ms98-a-0086 537.653750 540.918250 sure yeah but i- i think it's worth it you know that's
sw2721A-ms98-a-0087 540.918250 550.702625 you know they have strict gun laws i[n]- in London and they have and England and they have very few murders by by uh automatic weapons and and uh
sw2721A-ms98-a-0088 550.702625 558.291875 uh guns you know even the even the police for the longest time didn't really carry guns and all over Great Britain though the English

sw2721A-ms98-a-0090 563.533625 572.429875 no it's far less than what we have in the United States we're like the murder capital of the world [noise] in the civilized world you know above third world countries

sw2721A-ms98-a-0093 579.168375 585.221875 you know but i see that's the thing i totally a hundred percent see everybody's point my brother's a member of the NRA we argue about this over dinner 
sw2721A-ms98-a-0094 585.221875 590.280000 [laughter] and my mother and dad don't care one way or another so they just always say oh just shut up boys
