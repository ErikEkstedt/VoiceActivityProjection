sw2786A-ms98-a-0006 24.382000 25.561000 [silence]
sw2786A-ms98-a-0007 25.561000 27.980875 that's probably a good idea
sw2786A-ms98-a-0008 27.980875 38.360250 [silence]
sw2786A-ms98-a-0009 38.360250 40.038875 all kinds of little
sw2786A-ms98-a-0010 40.038875 51.319500 [silence]
sw2786A-ms98-a-0011 51.319500 61.255625 like i said it's good that that if you visit at least four or five colleges before they even you know go to attend go down there and visit for the weekend they do have those programs where you can go down there
sw2786A-ms98-a-0012 61.255625 73.446125 uh well no uh actually uh my my daughter is quite [laughter-young] yet but uh i went to a state school uh and i find that overall they're probably much cheaper
sw2786A-ms98-a-0013 73.446125 84.928750 and the quality of education's probably i would say is not much different than what'd you get at you know most of your like A&M Texas and uh you know Vanderbilt some of those
sw2786A-ms98-a-0014 84.928750 99.442750 i think there are some difference but probably in size in in in capacity of classes and that sort of thing but all in all the education level probably just as good if you if you participate 
sw2786A-ms98-a-0015 99.442750 134.527000 [silence]
sw2786A-ms98-a-0016 134.527000 136.345625 yeah
sw2786A-ms98-a-0017 136.345625 146.524125 [silence]
sw2786A-ms98-a-0018 146.524125 155.735875 [laughter-yeah] well i tell you what it it's expensive of course i worked my way through and uh i think that is a good idea in some cases except that now a days it's just so expensive
sw2786A-ms98-a-0019 155.735875 168.400125 [silence]
sw2786A-ms98-a-0020 168.400125 176.460500 well yeah it it it it can be cost prohibitive real quick you know i i wanna be able to at least i wanna pay my pay the tuition
sw2786A-ms98-a-0021 176.460500 183.421750 you know give her transportation if it's necessary and course i'd like her to live in the dorm if it's possible
sw2786A-ms98-a-0022 183.421750 189.348125 [silence]
sw2786A-ms98-a-0023 189.348125 196.448375 but i don't want her to have to work i i would i would i don't mind if she has a little part time job to earn just a little extra spending money that sort of thing 
sw2786A-ms98-a-0024 196.448375 209.017875 and summer work and things like that unless she just tends to go all the way through but uh i don't want to to have her to feel financially you know burdened uh and not you know concentrate on studying and that sort of thing
sw2786A-ms98-a-0025 209.017875 211.570750 but uh i know like
sw2786A-ms98-a-0026 211.570750 224.361750 i guess probably one of the things that that i've i've learned is that to try and pick a college where they have at least three different degree plans that you would like as an alternative you start one you don't particularly like that one
sw2786A-ms98-a-0027 224.361750 239.415625 you have something to go through because_1 if you have to change colleges then you lose hours and then you have to go through all that uh preliminary uh applications [vocalized-noise] yeah you know a lot of times you know people will go to a college when they get there they find out gosh i really don't like this at all
sw2786A-ms98-a-0028 239.415625 247.849000 and there's nothing there that they want other than that so they are faced with having to do all that and that can that can throw as much as a year out of your degree plan
sw2786A-ms98-a-0029 247.849000 255.508250 [silence]
sw2786A-ms98-a-0030 255.508250 266.600625 but uh that was one of the things that that i that i encountered uh so i i know [vocalized-noise] [laughter-yeah] so and then also the other thing is going to a j[unior]- to the junior college
sw2786A-ms98-a-0031 266.600625 278.920875 for at least two years to get all you preliminary courses your Math your English History Government all the things that that are time consuming uh and some of the course that you can take on television
sw2786A-ms98-a-0032 278.920875 285.133375 and get those out of the way before you even start a four year college because a lot of those course especially English and History
sw2786A-ms98-a-0033 285.133375 286.174875 [silence]
sw2786A-ms98-a-0034 286.174875 296.855000 well less expensive but not only that but a lot of those course they there're extremely difficult if you're starting out in a four year degree plan at a four year college
sw2786A-ms98-a-0035 296.855000 306.124000 they're extremely difficult and they go a little faster and and in junior college they go a little slower and you do learn you know a little bit more self paced and uh
sw2786A-ms98-a-0036 306.124000 335.265125 [silence]
sw2786A-ms98-a-0037 335.265125 336.938000 yeah
sw2786A-ms98-a-0038 336.938000 342.355875 [silence]
sw2786A-ms98-a-0039 342.355875 349.300125 well i think it's i think it's important that they do get away you know [vocalized-noise] not necessarily so far that you can't get to them_1 but at least
sw2786A-ms98-a-0040 349.300125 357.677750 you know a hundred miles or or even two hundred miles where you can at least go down there on a on a like a month a one month basis or they can come home
sw2786A-ms98-a-0041 357.677750 370.997125 you know and it's not real expensive uh you know uh lot of times they can share rides coming back and forth if they you know have people in the local area that live near them but uh
sw2786A-ms98-a-0042 370.997125 371.989500 yeah
sw2786A-ms98-a-0043 371.989500 375.125375 [silence]
sw2786A-ms98-a-0044 375.125375 376.328500 [vocalized-noise]
sw2786A-ms98-a-0045 376.328500 383.452375 [silence]
sw2786A-ms98-a-0046 383.452375 395.484875 you know none of did that we all stayed right close to home and of course i was married the whole time i was in school but uh but it was uh it was still one of those situations where mom and dad were still around if you needed them and uh
sw2786A-ms98-a-0047 395.484875 401.224750 you know not that i could really depend on them much but they were still there and you're not far enough
sw2786A-ms98-a-0048 401.224750 407.017625 [silence]
sw2786A-ms98-a-0049 407.017625 408.308625 uh-huh
sw2786A-ms98-a-0050 408.308625 417.004000 [silence]
sw2786A-ms98-a-0051 417.004000 422.317750 i know i guess probably one of the other things that i notice is that some of the colleges are very much
sw2786A-ms98-a-0052 422.317750 429.373125 uh encouraging you know the kids to participate in all the fraternities sororities and all the extra curricular activities
sw2786A-ms98-a-0053 429.373125 435.248375 much so because they they are money making things and they do support they do help support the school
sw2786A-ms98-a-0054 435.248375 439.583625 but i prefer colleges that don't stress that as the major focus
sw2786A-ms98-a-0055 439.583625 444.315500 uh i i'd rather them_1 go to the schools that focus on the on the academic part of it
sw2786A-ms98-a-0056 444.315500 456.094500 and that's a that's a that's a key now a days because_1 a lot of the college promote the partying and the and the sororities and things like that and and once you get hooked you know you can really get uh locked up in that stuff and your grades suffer
sw2786A-ms98-a-0057 456.094500 465.097375 they really do uh i got wrapped up in that of course i was in you know athletics and stuff like that but it got so time consuming it got to be to where
sw2786A-ms98-a-0058 465.097375 471.686500 i had to decide either i was gonna just quit all that mess and go study or or or you know just basically skin through
sw2786A-ms98-a-0059 471.686500 473.296625 [silence]
sw2786A-ms98-a-0060 473.296625 481.859250 uh well i quit i quit foot[ball]- i quit football because i just uh figured that it's not worth it what am i going to do with this after i get out i'm not gonna go pro football
sw2786A-ms98-a-0061 481.859250 487.872875 uh i'm not good enough i faced the you know faced that up front and say you know i'd rather get my grades
sw2786A-ms98-a-0062 487.872875 491.288875 and that's what i did i quit and went after after the grades
sw2786A-ms98-a-0063 491.288875 495.295250 no not at all [laughter] so it
sw2786A-ms98-a-0064 495.295250 496.227375 [silence]
sw2786A-ms98-a-0065 496.227375 498.770000 [laughter] uh but
sw2786A-ms98-a-0066 498.770000 499.855125 [silence]
sw2786A-ms98-a-0067 499.855125 507.768375 but you know you a lot of kids get hurt and then they they when they can't play pro ball anyway and then they don't have the education they should have what are they gonna do 
sw2786A-ms98-a-0068 507.768375 516.010625 and that's that's a that's a big thing right now that you that you're seeing is the athletics the a lot of them are playing before they even can finish college
sw2786A-ms98-a-0069 516.010625 523.571875 they're playing pro ball i think it ought to be be a prerequisite that they ought to have a degree with a certain amount of grade point average before they are even eligible for pro ball
sw2786A-ms98-a-0070 523.571875 526.305500 but they don't they wont do that
sw2786A-ms98-a-0071 526.305500 536.202125 [silence]
sw2786A-ms98-a-0072 536.202125 538.648875 uh-huh [vocalized-noise]
sw2786A-ms98-a-0073 538.648875 545.358500 [silence]
sw2786A-ms98-a-0074 545.358500 548.036625 yeah well i know i[t's]- it's getting down to
sw2786A-ms98-a-0075 548.036625 548.988875 [silence]
sw2786A-ms98-a-0076 548.988875 558.453250 it's getting down to grade school now i think they really need to get away from you know from stressing the athletics and extra curricular activities and get even at the young age get
sw2786A-ms98-a-0077 558.453250 561.412125 get the politics and the money out of the athletics
sw2786A-ms98-a-0078 561.412125 563.525625 and start getting back in the school
sw2786A-ms98-a-0079 563.525625 590.503125 [silence]
sw2786A-ms98-a-0080 590.503125 591.985625 uh-huh
