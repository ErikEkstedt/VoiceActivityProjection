sw2712A-ms98-a-0002 0.527875 3.297375 well i'm having a hard time remembering [noise] the last movie i saw
sw2712A-ms98-a-0003 3.297375 8.244000 [silence]
sw2712A-ms98-a-0004 8.244000 19.015750 yeah i guess uh i can remember seeing Dances With Wolves that was uh well that's uh that's an excellent film i- i highly i highly recommend that in fact i guess they're bringing that back out
sw2712A-ms98-a-0005 19.015750 22.313750 and uh they're adding fifty minutes to it or something like that
sw2712A-ms98-a-0006 22.313750 23.963750 [silence]
sw2712A-ms98-a-0007 23.963750 25.201125 that's right
sw2712A-ms98-a-0008 25.201125 26.662125 [silence]
sw2712A-ms98-a-0009 26.662125 29.500125 so it's going to be almost four hours before it's over
sw2712A-ms98-a-0010 29.500125 33.178750 or beyond yeah beyond that uh
sw2712A-ms98-a-0011 33.178750 39.658625 oh i wouldn't say that no because_1 i my w[ife]- my my wife and i went and i think she enjoyed it even more than i did
sw2712A-ms98-a-0012 39.658625 48.279875 so uh unlike Field of Dreams i guess the last Kevin Costner movie we'd seen before that was Field of Dreams i- i guess i'd have to admit that probably was more of a guy's movie than a
sw2712A-ms98-a-0013 48.279875 50.191125 than a than a lady's movie
sw2712A-ms98-a-0014 50.191125 52.069875 [silence]
sw2712A-ms98-a-0015 52.069875 58.870500 yeah yeah that's what we we saw that and i have to agree with you [laughter-i] [laughter-think] [laughter-that's] [laughter-more] [laughter-of] [laughter-a] [laughter-lady's] [laughter-movie] than a than a guy's movie
sw2712A-ms98-a-0016 58.870500 60.239750 but uh
sw2712A-ms98-a-0017 60.239750 62.060500 [silence]
sw2712A-ms98-a-0018 62.060500 67.423625 oh okay yeah we saw that on video that's that's that's another thing i guess that uh it's kind of
sw2712A-ms98-a-0019 67.423625 75.563375 kind of curbed uh us going out so much is that uh there was so many movies i didn't see when they came out beforehand that uh i know are coming out on video that you
sw2712A-ms98-a-0020 75.563375 81.852125 you look in the paper and you and you go well i can either see this or i can see this movie that i really wanted to see three years ago and didn't see
sw2712A-ms98-a-0021 81.852125 83.959625 [silence]
sw2712A-ms98-a-0022 83.959625 85.852500 i haven't and and i
sw2712A-ms98-a-0023 85.852500 99.757125 i- i hear it's excellent and it's probably something i'd i'd enjoy but i- i heard that it was so uh kind of gruesome in scenes that that and that was the part i probably wouldn't like but i heard that uh the acting was was great and it was a really thrilling movie
sw2712A-ms98-a-0024 99.757125 108.000125 and that in fact i read something in the paper here the other day that uh Anthony Hopkins i guess the guy who plays the the psycho or the villain that
sw2712A-ms98-a-0025 108.000125 116.353000 that uh he's getting letters from just all over you know the world and all that and and he suddenly become uh like a real screen idol or a uh
sw2712A-ms98-a-0026 116.353000 124.648125 like a a leading man you know he thinks it's funny but i guess uh woman in particular think it's such a scary movie and that uh that
sw2712A-ms98-a-0027 124.648125 136.910500 that they just identify with not identify with him but they they like his char[acter]- i- i wouldn't say like like his character but they're so fascinated by his character that uh they write him letters and and say how much they liked him and things like that
sw2712A-ms98-a-0028 136.910500 140.033000 [silence]
sw2712A-ms98-a-0029 140.033000 141.391875 [laughter]
sw2712A-ms98-a-0030 141.391875 149.278625 that's pro[bably]- that's probably a good idea unfortunately i think i i don't really enjoy movies with a whole lot of blood in them_1 so uh
sw2712A-ms98-a-0031 149.278625 157.256375 yeah yeah i'll i'll go see a drama like uh when the Untouchables came out which is another Kevin Costner movie well this is going to be a rut isn't it
sw2712A-ms98-a-0032 157.256375 167.984125 i just so happen i guess we just see those but my wife actually talked me into going to see that and i didn't really want to go see it and it was you know it was kind of a a bloody movie but uh it was done in such a way that you know
sw2712A-ms98-a-0033 167.984125 172.967375 and with gangsters and guns and all that i mean you are not going to avoid that so wasn't as
sw2712A-ms98-a-0034 172.967375 178.020500 it wasn't like they spent you know long shots relishing every drop or something like that
sw2712A-ms98-a-0035 178.020500 181.810000 [silence]
sw2712A-ms98-a-0036 181.810000 183.039125 yeah

sw2712A-ms98-a-0038 184.979250 186.188125 yeah we
sw2712A-ms98-a-0039 186.188125 191.069750 we we did in fact i think that is the last movie that we saw was Scenes from Mall and
sw2712A-ms98-a-0040 191.069750 195.221500 yeah so did we we thought it was really lousy and it

sw2712A-ms98-a-0042 196.745000 197.662750 and

sw2712A-ms98-a-0045 201.683125 204.192125 he he's not forty anymore that's for sure
sw2712A-ms98-a-0046 204.192125 205.557500 plus uh
sw2712A-ms98-a-0047 205.557500 214.085625 plus there's something about seeing those two walking through a mall just like and nobody paying attention is just like no no and especially with him carrying a yellow surfboard that was just like
sw2712A-ms98-a-0048 214.085625 221.139500 this this is real realistic and you know if i saw Woody Allen and Bette Midler go by and he's still carrying a yellow surfboard i wouldn't notice him i wouldn't even see him
sw2712A-ms98-a-0049 221.139500 222.096375 and
sw2712A-ms98-a-0050 222.096375 224.746125 [silence]
sw2712A-ms98-a-0051 224.746125 227.046500 oh yeah it was just a
sw2712A-ms98-a-0052 227.046500 228.447000 it was just a
sw2712A-ms98-a-0053 228.447000 230.577375 [silence]
sw2712A-ms98-a-0054 230.577375 231.791750 [vocalized-noise]
sw2712A-ms98-a-0055 231.791750 238.073500 yeah and i- i just can't believe uh that you could use up two hours watching two people go from store to store in a mall
sw2712A-ms98-a-0056 238.073500 247.935625 you know just uh in fact that was the funny part of it was sitting there and just seeing mall shots going you know i could go to North Park or i could go to Collin Creek or something like that and see that so
sw2712A-ms98-a-0057 247.935625 250.250625 so uh it was just not really fun at all
sw2712A-ms98-a-0058 250.250625 256.300125 [silence]
sw2712A-ms98-a-0059 256.300125 257.441750 um-hum

sw2712A-ms98-a-0064 262.876875 265.736750 and we went to an early show on that one so we didn't uh

sw2712A-ms98-a-0066 269.667875 270.904000 yeah

sw2712A-ms98-a-0069 275.342750 276.856250 yeah

sw2712A-ms98-a-0074 286.457875 291.406250 i didn't see that either that was something we'll probably rent a video on one of these days but uh
sw2712A-ms98-a-0075 291.406250 293.781625 [silence]
sw2712A-ms98-a-0076 293.781625 300.625625 oh Kiss Before Dying or something like that i've just seen advertised but i guess i haven't kept up on the movies that are out right just coming out right now
sw2712A-ms98-a-0077 300.625625 303.015750 [silence]
sw2712A-ms98-a-0078 303.015750 309.039875 um-hum um-hum that uh sounds sounds like you are pretty much split between romantic comedies and thrillers then
sw2712A-ms98-a-0079 309.039875 311.109625 [silence]
sw2712A-ms98-a-0080 311.109625 313.032875 yeah yeah
sw2712A-ms98-a-0081 313.032875 319.496375 i guess i guess the only real movie that we we wanted to go see and haven't gone to see yet is is Class Action II with Gene Hackman
sw2712A-ms98-a-0082 319.496375 325.709750 because uh he's usually i hear he's good in it but that's i guess he's good in almost everything he does so
sw2712A-ms98-a-0083 325.709750 330.090500 and uh so we're we're looking for one of these days to to see that
sw2712A-ms98-a-0084 330.090500 334.218250 [silence]
sw2712A-ms98-a-0085 334.218250 336.127250 i didn't see that no

sw2712A-ms98-a-0087 337.606125 339.197500 [laughter]
sw2712A-ms98-a-0088 339.197500 342.381250 that good i think that's what everyone said that it was a pretty lousy movie
sw2712A-ms98-a-0089 342.381250 343.935250 [silence]
sw2712A-ms98-a-0090 343.935250 345.995250 uh-huh uh-huh

sw2712A-ms98-a-0092 347.019375 351.005750 yeah yeah boy she hasn't been in a m[ovie]- well maybe that's why she hasn't been in a movie in a long time
sw2712A-ms98-a-0093 351.005750 352.791625 [silence]
sw2712A-ms98-a-0094 352.791625 361.929750 yeah i- i guess i guess i don't tend to even though it seems like we've been to a lot of Kevin Costner's movies maybe that's my wife's uh input more than i but uh but i guess i don't rely on anymore on
sw2712A-ms98-a-0095 361.929750 370.411125 star value i don't really go see movies because_1 it's like Robert Redford was in Havana and and boy that looked like a bad movie just in the coming attractions and i said and i said boy
sw2712A-ms98-a-0096 370.411125 374.393250 i haven't seen that i haven't was that good
sw2712A-ms98-a-0097 374.393250 383.857500 and [vocalized-noise] that i heard that uh and i don't particularly like Richard Gere i guess the only movie that i that i liked that he was in was Officer and a Gentleman and even then you know that was kind of pushing it 
sw2712A-ms98-a-0098 383.857500 388.991375 but uh but i heard every even if you didn't like Richard Gere you probably would've liked that movie
sw2712A-ms98-a-0099 388.991375 391.961500 [silence]
sw2712A-ms98-a-0100 391.961500 393.800000 uh okay

sw2712A-ms98-a-0107 406.763500 409.291375 i haven't seen that no no we didn't go see that
sw2712A-ms98-a-0108 409.291375 411.868000 i heard that was more of a kid's movie and uh
sw2712A-ms98-a-0109 411.868000 418.368875 [silence]
sw2712A-ms98-a-0110 418.368875 421.536750 yeah when you when he was actually in the funny paper and
sw2712A-ms98-a-0111 421.536750 424.016250 [silence]
sw2712A-ms98-a-0112 424.016250 425.534500 yeah that's true
sw2712A-ms98-a-0113 425.534500 429.636625 [silence]
sw2712A-ms98-a-0114 429.636625 430.647500 that pro[bably]-

sw2712A-ms98-a-0116 432.616000 439.593250 yeah i- i probably couldn't get my wife to go see that i think the last time i got to see her something like that was Batman it took me a it took me a
sw2712A-ms98-a-0117 439.593250 442.888250 [silence]
sw2712A-ms98-a-0118 442.888250 449.603250 well that's true i think that was the feel that they they were after was everything was really dark and and and kind of foreboding and
sw2712A-ms98-a-0119 449.603250 451.981125 [silence]
sw2712A-ms98-a-0120 451.981125 452.850000 yeah

sw2712A-ms98-a-0122 455.123125 456.465750 uh-huh
sw2712A-ms98-a-0123 456.465750 462.088750 that that might have been something because i think that i don't think that's movie that would have been as good on a on a small screen
sw2712A-ms98-a-0124 462.088750 469.438500 i mean you really it really had to be on a big screen i think especially for Jack Nicholson to come across because because_1 i mean what he did was so corny
sw2712A-ms98-a-0125 469.438500 478.843250 you know like it it's like they they spent a half hour setting up that line about bats in the belfry you know it's where Batman is climbing up to save what's her name and
sw2712A-ms98-a-0126 478.843250 489.003875 and he's up there and it's like all these things are are falling on him and it's like they they work all this time just when he gets to the top that the Joker can say something about well looks like we got bats in the belfry and it's like
sw2712A-ms98-a-0127 489.003875 498.094000 well i think they've been pushing to try to get this joke in for a long time yeah i hear a i hear a second Batman movie is getting ready to come out too yeah i guess Danny De Vito's in it
sw2712A-ms98-a-0128 498.094000 499.077000 i guess he's
sw2712A-ms98-a-0129 499.077000 501.428875 [silence]
sw2712A-ms98-a-0130 501.428875 503.268375 yeah i no
sw2712A-ms98-a-0131 503.268375 504.797000 [silence]
sw2712A-ms98-a-0132 504.797000 514.466375 i- i liked it till about a half hour from the from the end it looked it looked like it was going to be a funny movie and and until about until it got to be almost too much
sw2712A-ms98-a-0133 514.466375 515.780625 you know when they were
sw2712A-ms98-a-0134 515.780625 520.079000 [silence]
sw2712A-ms98-a-0135 520.079000 521.034375 really

sw2712A-ms98-a-0138 523.665250 524.996250 it
sw2712A-ms98-a-0139 524.996250 531.134625 i again i think the first hour was really everyone was laughing and and my wife and i were really enjoying it
sw2712A-ms98-a-0140 531.134625 543.940375 and then i think it was when he finally drove the car over the yard or something like that and she finally trying uh i mean it gets from from little things like throwing things at him and dropping things on him to to where she's actually
sw2712A-ms98-a-0141 543.940375 552.224375 trying to kill him and then i almost got real furious and and it was like a whole mood change right here and that whole chandelier scene at the end it was like
sw2712A-ms98-a-0142 552.224375 554.904375 [silence]
sw2712A-ms98-a-0143 554.904375 556.096625 yeah
sw2712A-ms98-a-0144 556.096625 563.756000 and and and it was funny because we usually like Michael uh Douglas and and Kathleen Turner i think we've we've liked everything like uh
