sw2742B-ms98-a-0008 24.123875 32.755750 uh we've been married twenty five years and uh we find that uh you know money management is is really important we
sw2742B-ms98-a-0009 32.755750 39.877125 uh don't have a lot but we still you know manage it fairly well we don't have a formal budget
sw2742B-ms98-a-0010 39.877125 43.114875 uh we have just found that uh
sw2742B-ms98-a-0011 43.114875 51.347125 by trying to practice uh paying our bills every month uh especially our credit card accounts
sw2742B-ms98-a-0012 51.347125 58.060250 uh we don't spend more in a month than what we typically expect to be able to pay at the end of that month
sw2742B-ms98-a-0013 58.060250 60.093750 or when the bill comes
sw2742B-ms98-a-0014 60.093750 63.471125 we find that that works pretty well for the most part
sw2742B-ms98-a-0015 63.471125 64.481125 [silence]
sw2742B-ms98-a-0016 64.481125 65.667125 [noise]

sw2742B-ms98-a-0029 134.871125 144.523875 well now then i guess that's really you know the the idea of budgeting we know you know how much money's going to be coming in and we know what we have to spend so we
sw2742B-ms98-a-0030 144.523875 151.780000 don't uh you know we don't go out and spend a lot of money that for one thing when we need it for something else
sw2742B-ms98-a-0031 151.780000 155.674500 and uh i guess that's a budget in in a sense
sw2742B-ms98-a-0032 155.674500 161.376750 it's it's strange i'm an accountant and my wife manages most of the money so
sw2742B-ms98-a-0033 161.376750 166.482500 you know i manage other people's money but or or you know help them manage their money
sw2742B-ms98-a-0034 166.482500 177.033000 so i kind of let her manage ours and then you know if there's any questions come up you know we discuss it and work things out whatever needs to be worked out 
sw2742B-ms98-a-0035 177.033000 180.939750 [silence]

sw2742B-ms98-a-0043 203.611125 212.699625 right it yeah you you have to i think that's the the a good idea for both you know both parties to know what the finances are
sw2742B-ms98-a-0044 212.699625 226.224250 then there's not ever any you know any uh question about whether or not the money can be spent or whether it's being spent properly or if one person knows that uh that if both parties know that 
sw2742B-ms98-a-0045 226.224250 229.358125 what has to be spent then there's not going to be
sw2742B-ms98-a-0046 229.358125 231.835500 i've already said that no questions
sw2742B-ms98-a-0047 231.835500 245.107875 and and then plus if there's ever any uh you know tragedy or anything in the family then both parties are prepared to to take over control of the of the financial situation for themselves if they have to 
sw2742B-ms98-a-0048 245.107875 248.636750 it's uh i've seen it uh seen it happen where
sw2742B-ms98-a-0049 248.636750 252.453000 you know people been married twenty twenty five years and [noise]
sw2742B-ms98-a-0050 252.453000 255.848375 one one party or the other managed the the money 
sw2742B-ms98-a-0051 255.848375 263.461375 and you know something happens and the other one was left not knowing what was going on so you really need both of them [noise]
