sw2741B-ms98-a-0003 9.235625 10.889625 um-hum

sw2741B-ms98-a-0006 18.670500 27.377750 [silence]
sw2741B-ms98-a-0007 27.377750 29.145625 um-hum
sw2741B-ms98-a-0008 29.145625 30.807750 um-hum
sw2741B-ms98-a-0009 30.807750 33.009000 [silence]
sw2741B-ms98-a-0010 33.009000 43.985625 well uh i probably a little bit older than you are so what i see um is the change that i see the most is the is that um
sw2741B-ms98-a-0011 43.985625 54.913375 women have much more many more occupations and careers to choose from than when i w[ent]- went to college when i went to college you could be a teacher or maybe a nurse or a secretary or
sw2741B-ms98-a-0012 54.913375 60.656875 but there were very few women in business at that time a few but they were the oddity and
sw2741B-ms98-a-0013 60.656875 72.873000 yes and now i see and and i see for my daughter which is wonderful [noise] she's thirteen and i see a whole wonderful world out there that she can choose from so many different jobs which i think is terrific because
sw2741B-ms98-a-0014 72.873000 79.889125 i'm a teacher and i mean i love teaching but though i think there are a lot of other things i would have liked better and um
sw2741B-ms98-a-0015 79.889125 89.222875 not that i would give the career up because it's it's a safe career plus [vocalized-noise] because_1 i always have a job plus i am a single parent too and i and i need the income
sw2741B-ms98-a-0016 89.222875 96.979750 but uh and i think that's a reason why [vocalized-noise] a lot of women have have started to work too is because economically it's just a must
sw2741B-ms98-a-0017 96.979750 104.825875 uh you just it's very difficult to get along on one income unless uh the male uh has an extraordinarily good job
sw2741B-ms98-a-0018 104.825875 114.694750 and especially men who teach school they don't make that much money and and most all they always either have they're either moonlighting or else their their wife works too
sw2741B-ms98-a-0019 114.694750 117.580750 um it's just an economic need now
sw2741B-ms98-a-0020 117.580750 122.535500 [silence]
sw2741B-ms98-a-0021 122.535500 124.363000 oh definitely
sw2741B-ms98-a-0022 124.363000 133.484750 [silence]
sw2741B-ms98-a-0023 133.484750 134.909250 um-hum
sw2741B-ms98-a-0024 134.909250 137.491625 [silence]
sw2741B-ms98-a-0025 137.491625 143.106875 oh yes exactly we have uh quite a few teachers at our school that are single parents and
sw2741B-ms98-a-0026 143.106875 153.629625 uh the majority is uh married couple with children but still there's a lot more than there used to be and see you never picture yourself in a situation like this when i married i thought i'd be married the rest of my life
sw2741B-ms98-a-0027 153.629625 165.295250 and uh but i'm all i'm really grateful that i went to college my mother always said you know get an education in case you need one because my father died when we were i have a twin sister and we were eleven when he died
sw2741B-ms98-a-0028 165.295250 177.747250 she had a nursing degree and she was able to make it but she said in j[ust]- you never know what's going to happen and i thank God that i did go to college and got a degree because otherwise i don't know how i would be able to raise my children
sw2741B-ms98-a-0029 177.747250 186.633125 [silence]
sw2741B-ms98-a-0030 186.633125 188.715250 isn't that something
sw2741B-ms98-a-0031 188.715250 190.343625 yes
sw2741B-ms98-a-0032 190.343625 192.600375 [silence]
sw2741B-ms98-a-0033 192.600375 194.128625 yes
sw2741B-ms98-a-0034 194.128625 200.198750 [silence]
sw2741B-ms98-a-0035 200.198750 202.175750 oh yes
sw2741B-ms98-a-0036 202.175750 203.584000 [silence]
sw2741B-ms98-a-0037 203.584000 215.377125 yeah i do too but i think it needs to continue to change and i m[ean]- i think it there's still not equality as far as uh paychecks for men and women i think that the we still have a long way to go
sw2741B-ms98-a-0038 215.377125 226.970875 um-hum and i think that uh uh i think by the year two thousand it we're going to see some uh a lot more changes uh hopefully that women are you know able to get the the executive jobs and hold positions that men 
sw2741B-ms98-a-0039 226.970875 234.975375 men do because they can do it just as well you know if they want to dedicate their uh most of their time to that they're they're they can do it
sw2741B-ms98-a-0040 234.975375 242.026750 [silence]
sw2741B-ms98-a-0041 242.026750 243.402500 hum-um
sw2741B-ms98-a-0042 243.402500 255.665375 [silence]
sw2741B-ms98-a-0043 255.665375 266.073750 exactly exactly and i think that's the way it should be i think it i mean not that i- i think that i'm equal to men because there's a lot of things that men can do that i
sw2741B-ms98-a-0044 266.073750 272.603750 could never do {strengthwise} and so forth but also there's some things women can do [laughter-like] have children that men can't do
sw2741B-ms98-a-0045 272.603750 285.859875 so you know i[t]- i[t]- i don't w[ant]- i don't want to be equal but i- i want to be i want [noise] to get what i deserve and i want to be able to be on the same level with them if i can do a job as well as i man i think i should get the same pay you know
sw2741B-ms98-a-0046 285.859875 292.562750 yeah and i just i'm not a women's libber i really am not but i- i think that we[ll]- that we have
sw2741B-ms98-a-0047 292.562750 301.353500 just as many rights as they do and i feel like if there's a qualified woman to do the job and if she's good or better than a man then she they should get the job with the same pay
sw2741B-ms98-a-0048 301.353500 303.752875 [silence]
sw2741B-ms98-a-0049 303.752875 305.657375 i do too
sw2741B-ms98-a-0050 305.657375 309.241500 oh i do too definitely definitely
sw2741B-ms98-a-0051 309.241500 311.671875 well it was good to talk to you
