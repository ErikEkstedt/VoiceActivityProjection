sw2781A-ms98-a-0029 106.202000 110.636375 and part of my problem is that i'm in and out a lot because

sw2781A-ms98-a-0048 205.216750 206.978125 i don't know
sw2781A-ms98-a-0049 206.978125 211.618250 i think i always run a little bit behind It takes me awhile to get used to
sw2781A-ms98-a-0050 211.618250 221.272625 [silence]
sw2781A-ms98-a-0051 221.272625 223.885625 oh i wouldn't wear slacks to work
sw2781A-ms98-a-0052 223.885625 227.732500 um people don't where i work i mean it's just not done
sw2781A-ms98-a-0053 227.732500 232.239125 at all but now i have worked places where they do and even then i still didn't
sw2781A-ms98-a-0054 232.239125 234.686625 [silence]
sw2781A-ms98-a-0055 234.686625 238.608500 i don't have a teenager i have a six year old and he's still
sw2781A-ms98-a-0056 238.608500 241.722000 he's still at the age where i can dress him how i want to [laughter]
sw2781A-ms98-a-0057 241.722000 257.397375 [silence]

sw2781A-ms98-a-0059 259.070000 265.854000 [silence]
sw2781A-ms98-a-0060 265.854000 276.156250 well i have a girlfriend who has a daughter that's a teenager and every year before school starts she has me take her shopping for clothes because they fight [laughter-too] much
sw2781A-ms98-a-0061 276.156250 293.171625 [silence]
sw2781A-ms98-a-0062 293.171625 302.566500 well i just read something in fact i think it was today about how the public a lot of private or a lot of the public schools now are going to uniforms
sw2781A-ms98-a-0063 302.566500 304.233750 yeah
sw2781A-ms98-a-0064 304.233750 312.696125 because uh they feel like there's too much competition in the clothing and it it clearly defines you know class
sw2781A-ms98-a-0065 312.696125 316.914500 lines in where you know the the Guess jeans and the
sw2781A-ms98-a-0066 316.914500 329.996000 you know stuff as opposed to the people who can't and so it takes people's concentra[tion]- the thought behind it is that people won't concentrate or worry about what they're wearing what everybody else is wearing and it will take their mind off that
sw2781A-ms98-a-0067 329.996000 335.162000 and you know enable them to you know study better plus they s[ay]-
sw2781A-ms98-a-0068 335.162000 337.991625 [silence]
sw2781A-ms98-a-0069 337.991625 339.691000 [laughter]
sw2781A-ms98-a-0070 339.691000 352.525250 [laughter] this was [noise] they weren't talking about it wasn't talking about actually i i kind of like that idea and i had my son in private school where they do wear uniforms and uh i i really like that
sw2781A-ms98-a-0071 352.525250 377.258875 [silence]
sw2781A-ms98-a-0072 377.258875 378.629375 huh
sw2781A-ms98-a-0073 378.629375 382.697125 [silence]
sw2781A-ms98-a-0074 382.697125 384.588750 that is yeah
sw2781A-ms98-a-0075 384.588750 397.380500 [silence]
sw2781A-ms98-a-0076 397.380500 409.526125 yeah i think well i think for a while kids were dressing nicer in colleges but um nowadays uh i i still i take classes at UTD and they um you know they wear jeans
sw2781A-ms98-a-0077 409.526125 411.942625 and sometimes they don't even have shoes on
sw2781A-ms98-a-0078 411.942625 426.341750 [silence]
sw2781A-ms98-a-0079 426.341750 427.983125 uh-huh
sw2781A-ms98-a-0080 427.983125 434.014375 [silence]
sw2781A-ms98-a-0081 434.014375 435.139125 yeah
sw2781A-ms98-a-0082 435.139125 443.627250 [silence]
sw2781A-ms98-a-0083 443.627250 446.248125 do you spend a lot of money on clothes for work
sw2781A-ms98-a-0084 446.248125 452.290875 [silence]
sw2781A-ms98-a-0085 452.290875 458.323625 you know i think and and this may be totally unfair and unfounded but it seems to me like
sw2781A-ms98-a-0086 458.323625 464.232250 women have to spend more money on clothes for work then men do because men can have a few suits
sw2781A-ms98-a-0087 464.232250 472.596125 and you know a bunch of different shirts and some different ties but you know women practically have to have you know a whole bunch of different suits
sw2781A-ms98-a-0088 472.596125 484.321375 [silence]
sw2781A-ms98-a-0089 484.321375 485.562000 yeah
sw2781A-ms98-a-0090 485.562000 489.339375 [silence]
sw2781A-ms98-a-0091 489.339375 496.483750 and then of course you know accessories you know shoes and hose and earrings and you know all that stuff
sw2781A-ms98-a-0092 496.483750 503.388500 um it's just i it's outrageous you know because you know you still spend two three hundred dollars on a suit
sw2781A-ms98-a-0093 503.388500 510.948500 [silence]
sw2781A-ms98-a-0094 510.948500 517.879375 no i ultimate [noise] leave and i haven't been at work in awhile so i i don't really know
sw2781A-ms98-a-0095 517.879375 526.873875 you know from what i i went to a concert earlier this week and saw some people and just noticed how there's a lot of the wider ties
sw2781A-ms98-a-0096 526.873875 530.231875 but they're not they're not the same as the wide
sw2781A-ms98-a-0097 530.231875 546.812000 [silence]
sw2781A-ms98-a-0098 546.812000 549.767500 do you think it has anything to do with the ages of people
sw2781A-ms98-a-0099 549.767500 552.603375 [silence]
