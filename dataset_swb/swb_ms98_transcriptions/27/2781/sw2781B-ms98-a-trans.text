sw2781B-ms98-a-0015 42.469250 53.343000 i was curious you know if they just want to talk about the words of uh related to clothing that polyester was coming back have you heard that uh i saw it on the TV that the models were
sw2781B-ms98-a-0016 53.343000 59.915125 they had a new kind of polyester uh whether that they just like to switch materials
sw2781B-ms98-a-0017 59.915125 64.768250 uh periodically i don't know we might i haven't we didn't talk about materials i
sw2781B-ms98-a-0018 64.768250 69.604750 i prefer you know the cotton with very little in fact when i look for
sw2781B-ms98-a-0019 69.604750 77.721250 uh i i try to go for the cottons and i don't know that polyester will although men's shirts are half-and-half or sixty forty or whatever

sw2781B-ms98-a-0024 88.927250 92.510000 this isn't necessarily sweater country
sw2781B-ms98-a-0025 92.510000 100.389500 uh you know i i guess they're not as popular as they were i don't know about how women if you do you have problems with air-conditioning or were you you were uh
sw2781B-ms98-a-0026 100.389500 102.734750 uh is that a factor
sw2781B-ms98-a-0027 102.734750 109.810000 [silence]
sw2781B-ms98-a-0028 109.810000 111.388375 that's very bad yeah

sw2781B-ms98-a-0033 133.091000 142.327875 they don't disappear but th[ey]- you know they're they're on a hook usually the vice president's or the manager's and again i used to wear them but i don't i don't bother with it right now
sw2781B-ms98-a-0034 142.327875 144.636875 yeah that is a problem uh
sw2781B-ms98-a-0035 144.636875 150.452125 where did i see an article about where they're about that subject where they're trying to
sw2781B-ms98-a-0036 150.452125 151.836000 have
sw2781B-ms98-a-0037 151.836000 161.694750 oh i know it was lunchrooms where they're trying to encourage people to stay at work and so that's why they even downtown this might be applicable
sw2781B-ms98-a-0038 161.694750 169.945250 where they're trying to have restaurants within walking distance but at the same time in other words you go down in a subway or whatever
sw2781B-ms98-a-0039 169.945250 178.480750 and go to lunch and they say that's so much more healthy for you than going out in the street in the open traffic and going to lunch you'd be better of
sw2781B-ms98-a-0040 178.480750 181.489375 i'm s[ure]- maybe you do have some tunnels down there
sw2781B-ms98-a-0041 181.489375 193.651625 and they they say that's so much more healthy for you to you know when you have to go out or go to lunch or whatever it's to to walk or however and get to a place that is uh you don't have to go in and out of the of the temperature
sw2781B-ms98-a-0042 193.651625 195.054500 [silence]
sw2781B-ms98-a-0043 195.054500 198.132125 whether that affects how you dress i can imagine uh

sw2781B-ms98-a-0056 237.234125 240.188750 oh you have a lot to experience i have two
sw2781B-ms98-a-0057 240.188750 250.048125 right [laughter] well have the opposite then [laughter] i have uh well one of they're almost now teenagers at one twenty almost twenty and one almost sixteen
sw2781B-ms98-a-0058 250.048125 254.351500 and i learned early on being surrounded by women here that the
sw2781B-ms98-a-0059 254.351500 263.744500 i i love to take them shopping but i don't pick anything out you know i i just kind of influence but uh the the teen the junior high teenagers really
sw2781B-ms98-a-0060 263.744500 267.471000 i don't know if you can describe how they dress you know you you
sw2781B-ms98-a-0061 267.471000 276.333500 [silence]
sw2781B-ms98-a-0062 276.333500 285.174875 i i know what angle that we can talk about here we they want us to talk about clothes around work but uh the way kids in school should dress and
sw2781B-ms98-a-0063 285.174875 294.006625 i'll give you my opi[nion]- i don't think that the school should just kind of let the kids dress what is the current style not that it's totally ridiculous of course but [vocalized-noise]
sw2781B-ms98-a-0064 294.006625 302.477625 [silence]
sw2781B-ms98-a-0065 302.477625 305.268125 public schools oh i didn't hear that yet
sw2781B-ms98-a-0066 305.268125 333.882625 [silence]
sw2781B-ms98-a-0067 333.882625 335.259750 right
sw2781B-ms98-a-0068 335.259750 342.201125 well well whoever said that in my opinion doesn't have any teenagers who didn't grow they won't do that they'll never pass it that will be like
sw2781B-ms98-a-0069 342.201125 343.364375 right
sw2781B-ms98-a-0070 343.364375 350.314875 [silence]
sw2781B-ms98-a-0071 350.314875 351.355125 uh-huh
sw2781B-ms98-a-0072 351.355125 353.740500 [silence]
sw2781B-ms98-a-0073 353.740500 363.561000 i can uh of course i went to school you know a hundred years ago in college and uh we did wear ties and jackets and this was they have since changed it was an engineering school a city
sw2781B-ms98-a-0074 363.561000 372.970375 it was in an downtown area like i don't know well you can't compare anything around here to the school in like no UTA here is in Arlington it's not exactly downt[own]- but i guess like that
sw2781B-ms98-a-0075 372.970375 382.206375 and they just historically since it was in the city they wanted us to wear jackets and ties and i did my whole college career which is i guess terribly unusual
sw2781B-ms98-a-0076 382.206375 391.999875 we wore jackets and ties for four years and i so subsequently i wanted to get a masters degree in in after i got out of the service and uh they changed drafts so there was a
sw2781B-ms98-a-0077 391.999875 398.784875 the styles have certainly changed to where i guess my campus now looks like typical uh college campus i guess
sw2781B-ms98-a-0078 398.784875 410.273250 [silence]
sw2781B-ms98-a-0079 410.273250 411.112750 huh
sw2781B-ms98-a-0080 411.112750 412.821500 [silence]
sw2781B-ms98-a-0081 412.821500 421.209875 the older i get the mo[re]- more open to other people's ideas uh you cannot be you have to let them come out with uh whatever they
sw2781B-ms98-a-0082 421.209875 430.702125 not whatever but some of their ideas too and so you kind of back off and see what people and i know their clothing is changing you know all the time and i'm i'm certainly open
sw2781B-ms98-a-0083 430.702125 436.892750 to how you should dress uh now of course the subject is work uh or clothes really i guess uh 
sw2781B-ms98-a-0084 436.892750 445.694500 uh and the on[ly]- again the one thing i am at at work is is certainly a professional look but i'm not saying that that will not cha[nge]- the professional look will look differently from year to year perhaps
sw2781B-ms98-a-0085 445.694500 447.502125 [silence]
sw2781B-ms98-a-0086 447.502125 451.579625 no i really don't it's uh uh
sw2781B-ms98-a-0087 451.579625 454.219500 go through a lot of shirts and think no i don't really
sw2781B-ms98-a-0088 454.219500 465.489375 [silence]

sw2781B-ms98-a-0093 473.985750 480.507125 well you're sure right there because not even when i wore a jacket and a lot of the guys when i was up at Spring Creek in uh Plano
sw2781B-ms98-a-0094 480.507125 491.926750 uh we think he just brought the same jacket even that wasn't a that's not a black mark against the man and you're right that uh women are expected to look more everything matches i guess

sw2781B-ms98-a-0100 505.031000 513.158000 your work without saying much about it do they ever bring the subject up of asking your opinion on on whether you want things to change on how you dress or
