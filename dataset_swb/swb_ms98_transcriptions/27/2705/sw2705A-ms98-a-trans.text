sw2705A-ms98-a-0038 81.467250 93.887000 well we have a really large house we have three kids and we bought a five bedroom house when we moved here and um it's getting to be too much [laughter] too much work to keep it up
sw2705A-ms98-a-0039 93.887000 104.104250 three three so we have a bedroom for everybody and then we have an extra playroom for them to pile all their toys in and an extra TV up there and the ironing board
sw2705A-ms98-a-0040 104.104250 105.451000 [laughter]
sw2705A-ms98-a-0041 105.451000 112.249875 well yeah i that's the other thing is i was working uh full time i just started back about a year and a half ago
sw2705A-ms98-a-0042 112.249875 122.898125 and um my youngest one got to be three years old and so then i went back to work and i decided after a year of being a secretary that what i really wanted to do was go back and get my master's [laughter-degree]
sw2705A-ms98-a-0043 122.898125 127.378875 and um so then i went to part-time work and i'm going to school part-time
sw2705A-ms98-a-0044 127.378875 141.228500 and uh it's getting to be too much financially too without my full time income so we're we're just decided to put last week to put our house on the market and um get a smaller house not too small though with three [laughter-kids]
sw2705A-ms98-a-0045 141.228500 153.051000 so so that that was kind of a hard decision to make but i think uh i it's just been an awful lot you know financial is one thing and that's kind of concrete but also it's just
sw2705A-ms98-a-0046 153.051000 162.925000 there it the house is just really big and there there's a lot of kids and a lot of space and it all gets messed [laughter-up] [laughter] 
sw2705A-ms98-a-0047 162.925000 170.597875 so and with cleaning out to you know to sell the house we're trying to clean things out in closets and the playroom and the garage and everything
sw2705A-ms98-a-0048 170.597875 177.321375 and when you have this much space you don't have to be as careful about throwing stuff out you just put it in the garage or put it in the playroom or something
sw2705A-ms98-a-0049 177.321375 188.607625 so it's ju[st]- we just have massive stuff that you know is we just accumulated too much stuff i mean not that we have a whole bunch of things it's just little junky you know old toys
sw2705A-ms98-a-0050 188.607625 190.718250 that's it

sw2705A-ms98-a-0079 259.958250 269.880250 i think well i don't i really have uh really relaxed standards about how well organized and cleaned it is i mean it has to be basically clean because_1
sw2705A-ms98-a-0080 269.880250 279.289250 you have to be organized e[nough]- enough to know where things are to be able to find things if it gets too messy you spend your whole life going through trying to find what you need
sw2705A-ms98-a-0081 279.289250 285.266875 so i learned that it has you have to maintain a certain standard of cleanliness but i mean organization but
sw2705A-ms98-a-0082 285.266875 293.703125 i- i mean compared to the other mothers here on my street that don't work i mean my house is just it looks horrible [laughter-compared] [laughter-to] [laughter-theirs]
sw2705A-ms98-a-0083 293.703125 297.704500 but i mean you have to decide what you're going to do you know if you going to
sw2705A-ms98-a-0084 297.704500 302.442625 what's the most important thing yeah so that's what slides for me
sw2705A-ms98-a-0085 302.442625 304.996500 [silence]
sw2705A-ms98-a-0086 304.996500 307.051750 right exactly
sw2705A-ms98-a-0087 307.051750 311.051625 [silence]
sw2705A-ms98-a-0088 311.051625 324.550875 yeah and we this house was new when we bought it and it's all white walls and so we put up some wallpaper and some drapes and you know but we just never got we didn't have the money we didn't have the time to really decorate it
sw2705A-ms98-a-0089 324.550875 333.416125 and i w[as]- said to my husband if we had a smaller house it wouldn't take you know hundreds of dollars to decorate one room it of
sw2705A-ms98-a-0090 333.416125 342.944625 you see we did this one huge wall that we have and it was like three hundred dollars worth of wallpaper and i didn't even buy that expensive kind you know that it wouldn't even cost that much but it was it's a real long wall
sw2705A-ms98-a-0091 342.944625 351.251250 so if we had a smaller house [laughter] everything would be smaller and it it wouldn't take w[ell]- it took us two weekends to put all the wallpaper up you know
sw2705A-ms98-a-0092 351.251250 352.493750 and uh
sw2705A-ms98-a-0093 352.493750 355.069375 but i have a feeling it's going to be hard
sw2705A-ms98-a-0094 355.069375 356.106250 uh
sw2705A-ms98-a-0095 356.106250 357.353375 [silence]
sw2705A-ms98-a-0096 357.353375 367.258750 we have we have driven around in the neighborhood we don't want our children to have to change schools we want to try and stay in the same school area so we've driven around the neighborhood and we've looked from the outside but um
sw2705A-ms98-a-0097 367.258750 377.232000 i still trying to find time to get this house this weekend we're going to finish up the garage and we're going to do you know i have a few other things i need to do here and then after that i hope
sw2705A-ms98-a-0098 377.232000 384.006875 that this house will be good enough for people to come through and look at it and then i want to start going to some open houses and
sw2705A-ms98-a-0099 384.006875 387.001125 and um you know look at some
sw2705A-ms98-a-0100 387.001125 394.421750 but i've talked a lot with our realtor about it and she assured me we could get you know a four bedroom house in the price range that we want
sw2705A-ms98-a-0101 394.421750 401.393250 in that area she said you're not going to like it as much as this one [laughter] i said yeah [laughter-no] [laughter-kidding]
sw2705A-ms98-a-0102 401.393250 402.552125 but
sw2705A-ms98-a-0103 402.552125 406.446625 [silence]
sw2705A-ms98-a-0104 406.446625 419.377000 um yeah for this house it's just in this area of Plano it seems the the houses are moving really quickly they said my realtor said about three to six months and maybe closer to the three months because we live
sw2705A-ms98-a-0105 419.377000 421.567500 half a block from the elementary school
sw2705A-ms98-a-0106 421.567500 423.622000 so that's real nice yeah
sw2705A-ms98-a-0107 423.622000 433.661000 and it is five bedrooms she said you you it's really hard to find that and most places places have four and there are people that really want five so that's another plus so it might be closer to three months
sw2705A-ms98-a-0108 433.661000 442.567000 and you know we'll be if we're real lucky we won't lose any money you know we'll we'll be able it's mostly the closing costs that are going to
sw2705A-ms98-a-0109 442.567000 452.576875 that y[ou]- we can we'll be be uh asking for more than we bought the house for three years ago but the closing costs are going to eat out just about all of it so

sw2705A-ms98-a-0115 463.752125 470.358250 right that's what that's what our realtor wants to do i've talked to some other people who have put contingencies on their houses
sw2705A-ms98-a-0116 470.358250 479.338500 and um but our our realtor just doesn't really like to do that she doesn't even want me to go out and look and fall in love with something until you know i yeah
