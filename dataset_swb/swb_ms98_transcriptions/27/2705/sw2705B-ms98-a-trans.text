sw2705B-ms98-a-0106 523.914500 535.358000 it's selling much better than than it than than they did i think new ho[mes]- new homes in certain areas uh you know are are are doing very well uh and i think uh
sw2705B-ms98-a-0107 535.358000 542.778375 when i bought this house was actually it's be in May it'll be five years and uh
sw2705B-ms98-a-0108 542.778375 545.161500 this was uh a f[oreclosure]-
sw2705B-ms98-a-0109 545.161500 553.273500 a for[eclosure]- foreclosure and uh so i mean it was h[ad]- had been pretty bad in this area for for awhile
sw2705B-ms98-a-0110 553.273500 561.989625 and and uh i guess over the past year it sort of i got my uh the appraisal you know the thing you get for what they're base your taxes on
sw2705B-ms98-a-0111 561.989625 568.210375 and it's gone up from it went down from what i bought it for and then and now it's come back up
sw2705B-ms98-a-0112 568.210375 575.314625 yeah well but then again i- i didn't care if it went down as long as i don't want to sell it because_1 then i have my taxes are going to be less but
sw2705B-ms98-a-0113 575.314625 580.540750 yeah but uh but you can tell by just riding around my neighborhood
sw2705B-ms98-a-0114 580.540750 590.854375 uh when i bought when i like i say when i bought this house there was oh just many many homes for sale and uh now uh
sw2705B-ms98-a-0115 590.854375 600.944750 you don't see quite as many and i and there's a lot of people like i just put a new roof on my house and repainted the outside and uh about a three or four w[eeks]-
