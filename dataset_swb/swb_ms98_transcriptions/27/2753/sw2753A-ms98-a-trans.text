sw2753A-ms98-a-0004 20.405375 24.399625 but at least we're we're going to the source of the problem
sw2753A-ms98-a-0005 24.399625 30.403250 and uh the source of supply the problem is here but the source [laughter-of] supply is there

sw2753A-ms98-a-0007 32.180625 45.579125 in fact i think a lot of the i've been to uh Peru several times i've never made it to other parts of South America but uh i have been to Peru and they need some assistance down there
sw2753A-ms98-a-0008 45.579125 58.922625 and [noise] i'm sure that uh as an undeveloped country they look look for it but there is not exactly a lot of uh physical responsibility there
sw2753A-ms98-a-0009 58.922625 60.320750 [silence]
sw2753A-ms98-a-0010 60.320750 62.684750 [noise] yes right
sw2753A-ms98-a-0011 62.684750 72.308875 and i i think that uh [noise] they need guidance and assistance but they need to learn how to stand on their own own two feet also

sw2753A-ms98-a-0016 103.061750 113.670500 uh native Latin Americans come down from the hills you can't imagine what poor is and uh the worst scene i've ever had i think was uh [noise]
sw2753A-ms98-a-0017 113.670500 119.335000 someone eating out of out of a garbage can on the streets in Lima Peru

sw2753A-ms98-a-0024 147.216375 154.567125 ambassador from Latin America that came to visit a senator in the US
sw2753A-ms98-a-0025 154.567125 159.512125 and was taken to his home for dinner and the uh
sw2753A-ms98-a-0026 159.512125 160.545375 [silence]
sw2753A-ms98-a-0027 160.545375 174.236500 home was palatial an[d]- they had five or six servants you know and and a lot of expensive uh holdings and all that and the ambassador said but i know what you make as a US senator how can you afford all of this
sw2753A-ms98-a-0028 174.236500 188.443875 and he said come i'll show you and he walked out in the backyard and the uh senator said do you see that hospital over there and the ambassador said yes and he patted his pocket and he said fifteen percent
sw2753A-ms98-a-0029 188.443875 195.328500 he said you see that school over there and the ambassador said yes and he [pott[ed]-/patted] patted his pocket and he said fifteen percent
sw2753A-ms98-a-0030 195.328500 206.955250 [laughter-so] so the next year the senator went to Latin America to visit the ambassador and was treated to dinner in his home and it was twice as large and four times as many servants
sw2753A-ms98-a-0031 206.955250 215.222250 he said well i know how poor your country is how can you afford this uh in such a poor country and he he said come i'll show you and he walked out in the backyard
sw2753A-ms98-a-0032 215.222250 228.128500 he said you see that hospital over there and the senator looked and he couldn't see anything he said no and the ambassador [potted/patted] patted his pocket and said one hundred percent so [laughter-you] [laughter-know] [laughter-it] it's a sad story but
sw2753A-ms98-a-0033 228.128500 232.955500 yes yes but it uh it is a problem
sw2753A-ms98-a-0034 232.955500 250.459375 [silence]

sw2753A-ms98-a-0041 280.839500 292.860750 well the oth[er]- the other instance i think of their inability to to handle things the cholera and hepatitis epidemics now in in Latin America
sw2753A-ms98-a-0042 292.860750 301.181875 and it shows the the unpreparedness for such such a problem and yet they're so
sw2753A-ms98-a-0043 301.181875 303.840125 [silence]
sw2753A-ms98-a-0044 303.840125 314.967000 yeah and they're they're so rich in resources there they're very rich in oil and and gas and they're very rich in gold and silver
sw2753A-ms98-a-0045 314.967000 321.704250 and very rich in in uh natural resources such as the fish and uh
sw2753A-ms98-a-0046 321.704250 332.874375 timber and and copper and all types of uh resources but they yes and but they don't have it's sort of like Russia they don't have the ability to develop it
sw2753A-ms98-a-0047 332.874375 334.362625 right
sw2753A-ms98-a-0048 334.362625 335.390750 [silence]
sw2753A-ms98-a-0049 335.390750 337.597125 and they've they're very [noise]
sw2753A-ms98-a-0050 337.597125 354.389250 [silence]
sw2753A-ms98-a-0051 354.389250 365.192250 you're e[xactly]- you're exactly right um-hum [noise] it it's sort of illustrated by the uh World Bank and International Monetary Fund not
sw2753A-ms98-a-0052 365.192250 370.676875 wanting to continue to do business there because they offer assistance then don't get repaid [noise]
sw2753A-ms98-a-0053 370.676875 383.250625 so it's sort of a thumbing of the nose uh approach they need it and they need to uh live up to certain regulations and and expectations but uh
sw2753A-ms98-a-0054 383.250625 389.893625 [noise] then don't and course it's a very volatile government uh situation too
sw2753A-ms98-a-0055 389.893625 401.372875 [silence]
sw2753A-ms98-a-0056 401.372875 402.884875 um-hum

sw2753A-ms98-a-0062 416.779750 418.267875 well the
sw2753A-ms98-a-0063 418.267875 426.418375 the solution discussed at one time and i think it has real merit on the drug situation is that the g[overnment]- the US government
sw2753A-ms98-a-0064 426.418375 428.982500 could spend less money
sw2753A-ms98-a-0065 428.982500 442.022625 by buying the crop and destroying it than they are in trying to to beef up the military and to do all other things i think it'd be cheaper to buy it and destroy it
sw2753A-ms98-a-0066 442.022625 445.467625 which would still give the uh
sw2753A-ms98-a-0067 445.467625 451.878375 the grower in Columbia and elsewhere in Latin America
sw2753A-ms98-a-0068 451.878375 457.994875 the uh the money that they apparently need and go go to the illegal crop for
sw2753A-ms98-a-0069 457.994875 460.777375 and it would save the US money in
sw2753A-ms98-a-0070 460.777375 463.696750 i[n]- in the long run how much they're trying to do [noise]
sw2753A-ms98-a-0071 463.696750 467.682875 [laughter] [laughter-true]

sw2753A-ms98-a-0073 473.576375 476.737750 no no and [noise] and
sw2753A-ms98-a-0074 476.737750 481.167500 i i think finding an alternate to that would be very good
sw2753A-ms98-a-0075 481.167500 487.201500 [silence]
sw2753A-ms98-a-0076 487.201500 489.500125 right um-hum

sw2753A-ms98-a-0081 502.507250 511.828875 yeah yes well one of these days uh i hope we'll find some some way to substitute uh good crops for illegal ones
