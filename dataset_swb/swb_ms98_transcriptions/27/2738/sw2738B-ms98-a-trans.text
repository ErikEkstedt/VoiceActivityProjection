sw2738B-ms98-a-0049 294.200625 299.214500 and uh why now we had a problem not too long ago our
sw2738B-ms98-a-0050 299.214500 309.958875 uh my brother-in-law recently moved and uh somehow or another w[e]- we got their new address on our credit reports because the uh
sw2738B-ms98-a-0051 309.958875 319.451875 i guess the credit card companies or whatever sort of keep up on some of them_1 and uh had uh picked up the new address and was sending all our bills over there
sw2738B-ms98-a-0052 319.451875 327.493625 so it was like okay now wait a second here so it'll be interesting to see how that works out how messed up things will be

sw2738B-ms98-a-0054 330.497500 334.999625 yup so that was a mess
sw2738B-ms98-a-0055 334.999625 342.077625 but uh yeah it the cre[dit]- there was a report not too long ago on the news here on uh
sw2738B-ms98-a-0056 342.077625 355.692125 they were going about how easily it was to get information about anyone and uh you know they got a credit history um you know went through all the moves that they made you know their uh
sw2738B-ms98-a-0057 355.692125 362.345875 it was just amazing the stuff that they got and it was so easily you know it was all public uh information it seemed like
