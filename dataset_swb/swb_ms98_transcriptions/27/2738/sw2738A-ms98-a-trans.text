sw2738A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.996625 [silence]
sw2738A-ms98-a-0002 0.996625 4.990625 have you run into any problems with invasion of privacy there
sw2738A-ms98-a-0003 4.990625 14.461250 [silence]
sw2738A-ms98-a-0004 14.461250 16.196000 um
sw2738A-ms98-a-0005 16.196000 28.947250 [silence]
sw2738A-ms98-a-0006 28.947250 39.996625 oh well that explains that i got one the other day they they did that uh it was a very important phone call from somewhere and they put me on a dead line for
sw2738A-ms98-a-0007 39.996625 47.934875 oh it must have been minutes and i said well it couldn't have been that important and i wound up hanging up and i've i've always wondered what that was 
sw2738A-ms98-a-0008 47.934875 66.998875 [silence]
sw2738A-ms98-a-0009 66.998875 68.517750 um
sw2738A-ms98-a-0010 68.517750 70.751875 [silence]
sw2738A-ms98-a-0011 70.751875 76.235750 [laughter] yeah yo[u]- you don't mind them
sw2738A-ms98-a-0012 76.235750 81.732125 [silence]
sw2738A-ms98-a-0013 81.732125 88.731250 no most of the people that are looking for me will try to get a hold of me at work that's about the only place they can pin me down
sw2738A-ms98-a-0014 88.731250 101.473750 and uh so about any important phone call that i have i'm going to get it at work and if the phone call comes to the house chances are it's either for my wife or one of the girls
sw2738A-ms98-a-0015 101.473750 109.972375 and so i just do not answer the phone call you know i'll let it ring until somebody else answers it and if they say dad it's for you
sw2738A-ms98-a-0016 109.972375 122.462000 i says what are they selling [laughter] and i'd say ninety percent of the time if the calls for me at home it's somebody who wants to sell me some oil leases or some
sw2738A-ms98-a-0017 122.462000 127.202375 some uh grave sites or something [laughter-like] [laughter-that]
sw2738A-ms98-a-0018 127.202375 129.473500 [silence]
sw2738A-ms98-a-0019 129.473500 131.360000 um
sw2738A-ms98-a-0020 131.360000 134.991500 [silence]
sw2738A-ms98-a-0021 134.991500 148.216750 i consider that to be the invasion of privacy particularly when i'm sitting down at the dinner table and they give me a call and i- i have to answer this phone to find out they're trying to sell me something and my dinner's getting cold [laughter]
sw2738A-ms98-a-0022 148.216750 150.495375 [silence]
sw2738A-ms98-a-0023 150.495375 151.996625 yeah
sw2738A-ms98-a-0024 151.996625 156.476375 [silence]
sw2738A-ms98-a-0025 156.476375 170.250500 well i think for metropolitan areas they realize that most people work and that that probably the majority of people both husband and wife work and so there's nobody home except maybe school kids after school
sw2738A-ms98-a-0026 170.250500 176.982750 and so they might as well not even try you know not even tie up people dialing phone numbers except in the evening
sw2738A-ms98-a-0027 176.982750 184.959375 fortunately they have uh sufficient respect that they don't call after ten o'clock and they don't call before eight o'clock in the morning
sw2738A-ms98-a-0028 184.959375 193.976500 [silence]
sw2738A-ms98-a-0029 193.976500 195.475375 yeah
sw2738A-ms98-a-0030 195.475375 197.733875 [silence]
sw2738A-ms98-a-0031 197.733875 207.976750 yeah i think if i got a phone call at six o'clock in the morning it was somebody trying to sell me something i would call the phone company immediately and list them as a nuisance call
sw2738A-ms98-a-0032 207.976750 224.410375 [silence]
sw2738A-ms98-a-0033 224.410375 226.747125 yeah
sw2738A-ms98-a-0034 226.747125 237.727750 but i think that's about the biggest invasion of privacy we have uh there are a few others but uh i presume that they have legitimate purposes
sw2738A-ms98-a-0035 237.727750 248.979125 yeah the government seems to intervene quite a bit uh one of the other complaints i have is uh have you ever checked your credit with the credit bureau
sw2738A-ms98-a-0036 248.979125 260.943250 you ought to do that it's interesting tha[t]- to see who has inquired about your uh finances is uh they're required to keep track and for i think about the preceding year 
sw2738A-ms98-a-0037 260.943250 275.843375 and it's interesting to see who has uh called and inquire about your credit there's quite a few companies that uh want to send you credit cards or uh or charge cards you know will ask for a uh credit dump and then 
sw2738A-ms98-a-0038 275.843375 282.692125 send you a letter trying to get you to take their credit card open a charge account with some company
sw2738A-ms98-a-0039 282.692125 290.716375 [silence]
sw2738A-ms98-a-0040 290.716375 292.207750 yeah
sw2738A-ms98-a-0041 292.207750 318.485125 [silence]
sw2738A-ms98-a-0042 318.485125 319.986625 um
sw2738A-ms98-a-0043 319.986625 328.479625 [silence]
sw2738A-ms98-a-0044 328.479625 331.479500 yeah that takes some paperwork to get straightened out
sw2738A-ms98-a-0045 331.479500 346.493875 [silence]
sw2738A-ms98-a-0046 346.493875 347.766000 yeah

sw2738A-ms98-a-0049 358.710875 361.488500 [silence]
sw2738A-ms98-a-0050 361.488500 366.364125 well there are uh lists that go by zip codes
sw2738A-ms98-a-0051 366.364125 380.497500 and uh a lot of companies will target people for specific zip codes because of uh you know if you live in the Elton region or Great Falls area of Fairfax County or or Montgomery County in Maryland 
sw2738A-ms98-a-0052 380.497500 395.195625 uh you're a prime candidate to be living in a rich house and uh and spend money on foolish things so uh that gets you on a mailing list for Jaguars and Rolls Royces and things like [laughter-that] 
sw2738A-ms98-a-0053 395.195625 400.269125 [silence]
sw2738A-ms98-a-0054 400.269125 401.957250 yeah

sw2738A-ms98-a-0056 411.458625 412.983500 um-hum
sw2738A-ms98-a-0057 412.983500 421.738625 [silence]
sw2738A-ms98-a-0058 421.738625 423.326500 yeah
sw2738A-ms98-a-0059 423.326500 439.797375 [silence]
sw2738A-ms98-a-0060 439.797375 447.938625 um-hum [noise] well there was something on the news just this morning that uh somebody in doing their
sw2738A-ms98-a-0061 447.938625 453.930750 uh Master's dissertation or something of that nature uh did a study
sw2738A-ms98-a-0062 453.930750 463.241000 of uh credit card reports or or credit reports and they found that something like twenty percent of them have erroneous data in there
sw2738A-ms98-a-0063 463.241000 474.190625 uh data that would prevent that person from getting a loan in the future or or getting a credit advance and uh the information was erroneous
sw2738A-ms98-a-0064 474.190625 486.990125 so uh i- i think everybody recommends that uh well they've they the uh story this morning on the radio suggested you ought to do this about once a year but i figure about once every five years is good enough [laughter] 
sw2738A-ms98-a-0065 486.990125 489.026875 [silence]
sw2738A-ms98-a-0066 489.026875 492.997625 uh it's about five dollars yeah it's fairly cheap
sw2738A-ms98-a-0067 492.997625 496.747625 [silence]
sw2738A-ms98-a-0068 496.747625 504.490625 yeah well i had it done just to make sure that there wasn't any wrong information in there everything seemed to be all right
sw2738A-ms98-a-0069 504.490625 508.979750 [silence]
sw2738A-ms98-a-0070 508.979750 517.250625 well apparent apparently not not if you uh approach the people and and they're they're interested in keeping their records accurate
sw2738A-ms98-a-0071 517.250625 520.999125 but uh it's just nice to make sure that no uh
sw2738A-ms98-a-0072 520.999125 523.966000 uh strange records show up
sw2738A-ms98-a-0073 523.966000 525.152500 [silence]
sw2738A-ms98-a-0074 525.152500 538.496000 there was one case i think here recently where some fellow down in Southwestern Virginia uh wound up being arrested for uh failure to provide child support
sw2738A-ms98-a-0075 538.496000 549.987750 and he didn't have any children and he [laughter-had] a heck of a time convincing the authorities that he wasn't the the party that was responsible for failing to make child support payments [laughter]
sw2738A-ms98-a-0076 549.987750 554.690750 [silence]
sw2738A-ms98-a-0077 554.690750 557.980125 [laughter]
