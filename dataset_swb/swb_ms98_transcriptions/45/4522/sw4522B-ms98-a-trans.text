sw4522B-ms98-a-0003 4.124625 10.443750 [silence] 
sw4522B-ms98-a-0004 10.443750 11.174500 yeah 
sw4522B-ms98-a-0005 11.174500 15.775500 [silence]
sw4522B-ms98-a-0006 15.775500 17.116625 how long ago was that
sw4522B-ms98-a-0007 17.116625 20.441250 [silence]
sw4522B-ms98-a-0008 20.441250 21.198500 okay
sw4522B-ms98-a-0009 21.198500 23.493750 [silence]
sw4522B-ms98-a-0010 23.493750 27.432625 yes but that was uh okay so that was fairly recent and even then
sw4522B-ms98-a-0011 27.432625 31.315750 a lot of the conditions i think you're right they haven't improved that much
sw4522B-ms98-a-0012 31.315750 37.490125 [silence]
sw4522B-ms98-a-0013 37.490125 40.304000 yeah um-hum yeah the
sw4522B-ms98-a-0014 40.304000 43.278000 [silence]
sw4522B-ms98-a-0015 43.278000 44.086125 yeah
sw4522B-ms98-a-0016 44.086125 51.973500 [silence]
sw4522B-ms98-a-0017 51.973500 52.684375 huh
sw4522B-ms98-a-0018 52.684375 53.748125 [silence]
sw4522B-ms98-a-0019 53.748125 54.672750 sounds tough
sw4522B-ms98-a-0020 54.672750 57.346750 [silence]
sw4522B-ms98-a-0021 57.346750 57.971250 yeah
sw4522B-ms98-a-0022 57.971250 65.534375 [silence]
sw4522B-ms98-a-0023 65.534375 66.398500 right
sw4522B-ms98-a-0024 66.398500 71.149000 [silence]
sw4522B-ms98-a-0025 71.149000 72.061875 uh-huh
sw4522B-ms98-a-0026 72.061875 79.235750 [silence]
sw4522B-ms98-a-0027 79.235750 82.479875 oh yeah that's that [laughter] doesn't seem right does it [laughter]
sw4522B-ms98-a-0028 82.479875 85.985250 [silence]
sw4522B-ms98-a-0029 85.985250 86.977625 yeah
sw4522B-ms98-a-0030 86.977625 93.098750 i you know you walk into one of those places and you basically start to feel depressed because they don't
sw4522B-ms98-a-0031 93.098750 99.924625 a lot of places don't have a good atmosphere they're ju[st]- it's almost like they just shove people in there and wait for them to die
sw4522B-ms98-a-0032 99.924625 110.509375 you know and it's it's really it's a bad problem uh i work at Honeywell up here and i was talking to a guy that's actually working toward mobility aids for handicap people
sw4522B-ms98-a-0033 110.509375 121.740375 and one of the things he's done is interview uh nursing home directors because they're looking for [laughter] get this they're trying to find out ways to restrain patients
sw4522B-ms98-a-0034 121.740375 133.871750 so that they don't look like they're restrained because apparently the family members who come to visit get upset understandably upset when they see that their loved one is in restraints you know
sw4522B-ms98-a-0035 133.871750 142.875750 uh at the same time you have to restrain him because they might hurt themselves they might stand up and not be able to to stay stood up or might fall down or whatever
sw4522B-ms98-a-0036 142.875750 149.140750 so it's an interesting problem that's just one of the many things that you know you have to think about in a nursing home
sw4522B-ms98-a-0037 149.140750 154.663125 but you know the stuff that you told me is there's no excuse for that you know
sw4522B-ms98-a-0038 154.663125 169.414750 [silence]
sw4522B-ms98-a-0039 169.414750 173.154875 right stuff when they're not on their guard you know
sw4522B-ms98-a-0040 173.154875 184.954500 [silence]
sw4522B-ms98-a-0041 184.954500 192.110875 oh sure you know it's it's really a good idea to look at places and see what's out there and see what th[e]- the modes of treatment are
sw4522B-ms98-a-0042 192.110875 194.285000 and and how people act
sw4522B-ms98-a-0043 194.285000 200.354625 [silence]
sw4522B-ms98-a-0044 200.354625 211.323000 yeah you know it really is you know that brings up a good point i've got a friend of mine up here and we were talking about this because his father is getting to the age where they're going to have to decide what to do and
sw4522B-ms98-a-0045 211.323000 220.021250 he brought up a real interesting suggestion that works well for families that have a lot of kids in it like i co[me]- i come from a family that has five kids
sw4522B-ms98-a-0046 220.021250 222.886875 well the way he said it was
sw4522B-ms98-a-0047 222.886875 224.525250 our parents
sw4522B-ms98-a-0048 224.525250 235.092125 spent you know quite a bit of time when we were young taking care of us you know call it call it three years per child now if you have five children that's fifteen years total
sw4522B-ms98-a-0049 235.092125 244.679000 therefore shouldn't it be right that they should be able to stay with one family member uh in a rotating fashion for fifteen years free of charge
sw4522B-ms98-a-0050 244.679000 247.371750 there you go it it's essentially repayment
sw4522B-ms98-a-0051 247.371750 253.316750 [silence]
sw4522B-ms98-a-0052 253.316750 264.209375 yeah that's it but the thing is hold on i got one more thing and i'll let you talk [laughter] because_1 we started talking about that you know we started saying well you know some family members might not agree to do that
sw4522B-ms98-a-0053 264.209375 276.998250 and he said fine let the one who does agree to do it keep him keep the f[ather]- keep the father or mother for a longer time and charge the family member who doesn't cooperate just say basically look
sw4522B-ms98-a-0054 276.998250 283.298375 uh i'll take care of mom and dad for you but you have to give me a kind of a payment for doing that for you
sw4522B-ms98-a-0055 283.298375 286.925875 you know so essentially it it relieved them of the burden
sw4522B-ms98-a-0056 286.925875 287.996875 uh
sw4522B-ms98-a-0057 287.996875 293.744750 and at the same time everybody kind of comes out happy i don't know if that would work but then again it it depends on the family size
sw4522B-ms98-a-0058 293.744750 295.549000 [silence]
sw4522B-ms98-a-0059 295.549000 297.727500 yeah uh-huh
sw4522B-ms98-a-0060 297.727500 299.906000 [silence]
