sw4540B-ms98-a-0017 51.339000 52.981625 out of the question yeah
sw4540B-ms98-a-0018 52.981625 55.309125 yeah i uh i went through the same thing i
sw4540B-ms98-a-0019 55.309125 63.172000 i uh you know we do a lot of hunting out here and stuff and you know rifles and stuff we've never had a problem with handguns sometimes i wonder because_1
sw4540B-ms98-a-0020 63.172000 68.452500 you know what do you do with a handgun i mean you don't you really you can't hunt with it uh
sw4540B-ms98-a-0021 68.452500 80.333625 i mean you know you you can know how to treat them_1 or you know how to to use them_1 properly but i just have a har[d]- you know i don't think there ought to be a outright ban but i think there ought to be some more restrictions on handguns rather than rifles
sw4540B-ms98-a-0022 80.333625 90.340000 just because it's so much easier to conceal a handgun f[or]- it's easy for a kid to get to it and and you know hurt himself with a handgun i think more so than even a rifle
sw4540B-ms98-a-0023 90.340000 101.425500 so i yeah i'm along with you there i just i have real hard time with handguns but uh like i say i don't want anybody taking my rifles away from me [laughter] but uh
sw4540B-ms98-a-0024 101.425500 105.872625 yeah uh d[id]- did you hunt much out there or in Kansas or
sw4540B-ms98-a-0025 105.872625 107.619750 uh-huh
sw4540B-ms98-a-0026 107.619750 109.468500 yeah
sw4540B-ms98-a-0027 109.468500 110.894500 um-hum
sw4540B-ms98-a-0028 110.894500 112.780625 [silence]
sw4540B-ms98-a-0029 112.780625 114.156625 yeah
sw4540B-ms98-a-0030 114.156625 121.573125 well that that you know really gets into that rights thing i mean there's there's a fine line i guess in everything and gun control is one where 
sw4540B-ms98-a-0031 121.573125 125.322375 you know if you could get some proper training and education it's
sw4540B-ms98-a-0032 125.322375 126.614750 [silence]
sw4540B-ms98-a-0033 126.614750 134.506375 you know i think you'd you'd find that all th[e]- the accidents would definitely go down and i you know i remember taking hunter safety and i was like eleven or twelve years old
sw4540B-ms98-a-0034 134.506375 138.744750 i mean before my dad would take me out deer hunting at all even you know even though i wasn't hunting
sw4540B-ms98-a-0035 138.744750 141.087500 i had to know how to handle a gun and
sw4540B-ms98-a-0036 141.087500 146.482750 i- i think you're right though i- you know a lot of the inner cities and stuff like that they just don't get that kind of training
sw4540B-ms98-a-0037 146.482750 148.294125 and uh
sw4540B-ms98-a-0038 148.294125 159.169875 and i you know i'm a i the only that i hate is uh well along with that training is i when kids have accidents with guns i there's a lot of stuff coming out now that they're going to start holding the parents responsible for not
sw4540B-ms98-a-0039 159.169875 172.462250 making the gun safe and i think there's a lot to that because kids are just naturally curious and then and you know when they're five and six years old accidents will happen that's why you know they need to be locked up the ammunition kept separate and all kinds of stuff
sw4540B-ms98-a-0040 172.462250 174.484250 [silence]
sw4540B-ms98-a-0041 174.484250 176.138875 yeah yeah
sw4540B-ms98-a-0042 176.138875 180.571750 [silence]
sw4540B-ms98-a-0043 180.571750 185.641500 well i mean i don't i have a real hard time with even keeping a a loaded weapon in my house uh
sw4540B-ms98-a-0044 185.641500 196.189125 you know you hear you hear somebody come in your house and you're a lot better off letting them take about whatever they want if they're there to steal something rather than take a chance be the hero and get shot or something i
sw4540B-ms98-a-0045 196.189125 200.783500 you know i just there's nothing more valuable than life [laughter-itself] so
sw4540B-ms98-a-0046 200.783500 201.723875 but
sw4540B-ms98-a-0047 201.723875 205.831625 yeah i- i definitely i you know was reading the article on uh
sw4540B-ms98-a-0048 205.831625 214.619500 well on this Ross Perot you know how he's talking about running for the Presidency and i guess he's a conservative uh you know he's more of a Republican politically but
sw4540B-ms98-a-0049 214.619500 223.037375 he's got he had some wild ideas about gun control i guess he's really fo[r]- he's he's for gun control big time and he was saying how he would go in for some
sw4540B-ms98-a-0050 223.037375 231.339125 some unwarranted searches and seizures of any guns that aren't registered and that really surprised me i like i say i wouldn't want that to to happen
sw4540B-ms98-a-0051 231.339125 240.608375 [silence]
sw4540B-ms98-a-0052 240.608375 241.593875 um-hum
sw4540B-ms98-a-0053 241.593875 243.074625 [silence]
sw4540B-ms98-a-0054 243.074625 244.827125 yeah yeah
sw4540B-ms98-a-0055 244.827125 250.271375 i yeah i understand he was pro he was he was for uh abortion rights 
sw4540B-ms98-a-0056 250.271375 260.604000 uh and i was really like i say it really surprised me because most of those guys i mean from that the conservative end they are just i mean gun control one hundred percent the NRA is their best friend and
sw4540B-ms98-a-0057 260.604000 267.875375 the best lobbyist so i was kind of surprised to see that but you know i think though on the outside too the NRA sometimes goes overboard you know
sw4540B-ms98-a-0058 267.875375 269.317875 [silence]
sw4540B-ms98-a-0059 269.317875 277.747750 [noise] you know they're i think they're like any lobbyist you've got extremists on both ends you know and they're saying that there's nothing wrong with these assault rifles and this that and the other you know
sw4540B-ms98-a-0060 277.747750 283.875000 and and handguns are just fine and i just think you know there's some middle ground there to where
sw4540B-ms98-a-0061 283.875000 296.752500 that they maybe go overboard and do too much they i guess they do have a lot of lobbying pow[er]- power and you know their big thing is well if you you stop banning one type then it's going to lead to the next and so on and
sw4540B-ms98-a-0062 296.752500 299.042000 yeah and i you know i
