sw4590A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 4.835250 [noise] uh do you have any brilliant [inedeas/ideas] about [laughter-how] [laughter-to] reduce crime
sw4590A-ms98-a-0002 4.835250 20.116750 [silence]
sw4590A-ms98-a-0003 20.116750 21.797500 it seems
sw4590A-ms98-a-0004 21.797500 35.833750 well it it seems like such a catch twenty two you know my first inclination is to say stop being so lenient when people do something rotten you keep them_1 in jail and you make them know that your se[rious]- you're very serious [noise] uh but then again uh
sw4590A-ms98-a-0005 35.833750 50.758250 the taxing situation you know how can we pay to keep all these people in jail that's when you say well don't raise my taxes you know maybe we shouldn't lock up the guy who has too many traffic tickets yeah maybe we shouldn't do this an[d]- you know and then you stop start eroding it
sw4590A-ms98-a-0006 50.758250 54.840125 you know i substitute teach i deal with high school kids and
sw4590A-ms98-a-0007 54.840125 61.433875 an[d]- i- i find that attitudes at home are such i mean the kids will curse right in front of my face and
sw4590A-ms98-a-0008 61.433875 69.206625 they won't even go oops you know they they just have no regard and i'm not saying they're gonna turn into criminals but i think it's a general trend toward
sw4590A-ms98-a-0009 69.206625 79.878375 people just relaxing their standards so much and i think that's why we have more crime because parents and schools are not stopping this when the kids are young
sw4590A-ms98-a-0010 79.878375 82.224000 and they just keep pushing
sw4590A-ms98-a-0011 82.224000 92.077375 [silence]
sw4590A-ms98-a-0012 92.077375 93.614000 yeah well you know
sw4590A-ms98-a-0013 93.614000 99.827125 yeah generally you know a kid'll do something that's outrageous and they'll say well what are you going to do to me and it's almost like the criminal system
sw4590A-ms98-a-0014 99.827125 107.328875 there's not much i can do to them i can't really do anything to them one fellow said i said how about_1 you do your work and he said well how about_1 i throw these scissors at you
sw4590A-ms98-a-0015 107.328875 119.497000 and instead of getting uh flustered i said well i wish you would because_1 then i can really punish you i can send you to detention et cetera if you just bad mouth me and generally giving me a hard time there's really nothing i can do
sw4590A-ms98-a-0016 119.497000 125.019000 an[d]- and i think you know minor criminals feel the same way like what are they [laughter-gonna] do
sw4590A-ms98-a-0017 125.019000 135.418500 and and i think that's the the biggest thing that unless people know that you're serious and you're not gonna tolerate that kind of behavior in anybody i this is just gonna keep going
sw4590A-ms98-a-0018 135.418500 149.555375 [silence]
sw4590A-ms98-a-0019 149.555375 161.887125 well we had a yeah we had a big incident at the local high school a teacher who happened to be a parent and four girls were um in a horrible head on accident a drunk driver hit them
sw4590A-ms98-a-0020 161.887125 172.499250 um the people who were in the car who got hit two of them died and two of them seriously injured this guy you know crossed a divider he had been arrested twice for drunk dri[ving]- driving
sw4590A-ms98-a-0021 172.499250 178.021500 um they didn't lock him up they took his license away but they didn't take away his car key
sw4590A-ms98-a-0022 178.021500 187.977250 you know there he was you know [laughter-it's] [laughter-like] you know in the old Arab countries you know you steal they take your hand away i mean this guy can still drive as long as he can get into a car he's driving
sw4590A-ms98-a-0023 187.977250 189.499250 you know he's just
sw4590A-ms98-a-0024 189.499250 191.357875 [silence]

sw4590A-ms98-a-0029 212.202500 218.223125 well you know i think counseling is kind of like dieting until you decide you really want it to work you [laughter-know]
sw4590A-ms98-a-0030 218.223125 226.320500 it it's not gonna work anyway you have to cooperate with that kind of stuff i- i it's a real scary problem i don't know what the answers are
sw4590A-ms98-a-0031 226.320500 228.664875 [silence]
sw4590A-ms98-a-0032 228.664875 231.101625 [laughter]
sw4590A-ms98-a-0033 231.101625 236.484375 [noise] you know and then they bring up the thing about um whether we should have death penalties
sw4590A-ms98-a-0034 236.484375 247.425250 uh i guess you know th[e]- the top of the the bad guy ladder maybe you know some of those people would be affected but there's lots of crime going on besides murder where
sw4590A-ms98-a-0035 247.425250 249.855875 you know it's still out of hand
sw4590A-ms98-a-0036 249.855875 260.333750 [silence]
sw4590A-ms98-a-0037 260.333750 261.791000 [laughter]

sw4590A-ms98-a-0039 279.917500 291.734375 my husband makes a joke about well an armed society is a polite society if if good guys had guns as well as [laughter-bad] guys then you know maybe that wouldn't be but i said nah you still have survival of the fittest because
sw4590A-ms98-a-0040 291.734375 296.742500 you know then the bad guys would become better at using the [laughter-guns] [laughter-you] [laughter-know]
