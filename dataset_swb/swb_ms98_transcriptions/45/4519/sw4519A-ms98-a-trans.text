sw4519A-ms98-a-0002 0.351500 1.992875 [silence]
sw4519A-ms98-a-0003 1.992875 3.623500 your turn
sw4519A-ms98-a-0004 3.623500 24.141625 [silence]
sw4519A-ms98-a-0005 24.141625 29.408625 well i have to say i really don't have a budget
sw4519A-ms98-a-0006 29.408625 38.720500 both my wife and i uh grew up in uh families of rather modest means and uh
sw4519A-ms98-a-0007 38.720500 48.094000 our family income at this point is comfortable upper middle class i guess you might say and uh we're both so
sw4519A-ms98-a-0008 48.094000 50.527750 uh frugal
sw4519A-ms98-a-0009 50.527750 63.581375 that um we really don't need a budget you know we just sort of invest the money and go on vacations and always never seem to have any money problems which i guess is a comfortable thing
sw4519A-ms98-a-0010 63.581375 67.937250 [silence]
sw4519A-ms98-a-0011 67.937250 74.965125 well we stay within our means but we don't do it uh by conscious effort it just sort of happens automatically
sw4519A-ms98-a-0012 74.965125 84.399125 although we just moved to California and uh the cost of living here in California is um i would say rather pathological [laughter]
sw4519A-ms98-a-0013 84.399125 93.255250 uh housing prices are you know like from four to ten times more expensive than um
sw4519A-ms98-a-0014 93.255250 104.642125 um they were where i came from in uh Dallas [noise] yeah so uh
sw4519A-ms98-a-0015 104.642125 117.394625 uh that presents um a real shock [laughter] actu[ally]- actually our standard of living has gone down somewhat since we've moved to California but
sw4519A-ms98-a-0016 117.394625 120.007625 [silence]
sw4519A-ms98-a-0017 120.007625 127.503375 yeah it's God's country uh and one way you know that is that only God can afford it [laughter]
sw4519A-ms98-a-0018 127.503375 134.819375 um so budget is not a problem for us
sw4519A-ms98-a-0019 134.819375 144.209875 uh least it hasn't been it may it may be at this point but uh up until this point it really hasn't been when i uh was in uh
sw4519A-ms98-a-0020 144.209875 157.185750 undergraduate school a long long time ago i uh noted that the monthly salary starting average monthly [saly/salary] salary for engineers that [vocalized-noise] in my discipline was like
sw4519A-ms98-a-0021 157.185750 165.665750 oh six hundred and ten dollars a month or something like that and uh i noted at that point that i was
sw4519A-ms98-a-0022 165.665750 177.910000 you know if that's what my salary was that i drew then i would be making almost twice as much as my father made during his best year ever so
sw4519A-ms98-a-0023 177.910000 183.523625 i stopped worrying about money and uh never have worried about money since then
sw4519A-ms98-a-0024 183.523625 186.815375 [silence]
sw4519A-ms98-a-0025 186.815375 201.806125 sometimes uh it's a bit of a a problem you know because i guess i don't really manage my money the way i should but uh i suppose i've lost money on not taking good advantage of of uh investments but
sw4519A-ms98-a-0026 201.806125 209.782875 [silence]
sw4519A-ms98-a-0027 209.782875 212.054125 um-hum
sw4519A-ms98-a-0028 212.054125 230.858875 [silence]
sw4519A-ms98-a-0029 230.858875 237.001750 well i guess we're both lucky in that regard then
sw4519A-ms98-a-0030 237.001750 239.390750 uh how big is your family
sw4519A-ms98-a-0031 239.390750 241.307125 [silence]
sw4519A-ms98-a-0032 241.307125 243.001375 i see
sw4519A-ms98-a-0033 243.001375 248.187625 [silence]
sw4519A-ms98-a-0034 248.187625 252.739375 so how do you and when once you get ten children though you may have
sw4519A-ms98-a-0035 252.739375 253.907750 [silence]
sw4519A-ms98-a-0036 253.907750 256.799500 oh all right [laughter]
sw4519A-ms98-a-0037 256.799500 269.420500 i have two kids uh one nine and one thirteen and they are beginning to be a budget problem but uh have not been really up until this up to this point
sw4519A-ms98-a-0038 269.420500 278.715625 i give them_1 uh i give them_1 an allowance and they um i basically give my son ten dollars a week and i put
sw4519A-ms98-a-0039 278.715625 283.696250 half of it in the bank and i give give him the other half in cold cash
sw4519A-ms98-a-0040 283.696250 295.483625 and uh he has a teller card so he can uh do what he wi[shes]- do what he wishes with the money that i put in the bank but at least it isn't you know burning a hole in his pocket
sw4519A-ms98-a-0041 295.483625 299.074000 if he wants to use it he has to go get it and that usually
