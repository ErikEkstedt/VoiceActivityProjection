sw4565A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.042375 [noise]
sw4565A-ms98-a-0002 0.042375 7.500500 i you know actually in this modern day and age it seems like uh uh 
sw4565A-ms98-a-0003 7.500500 16.276750 we have more and more leisure time because uh we have so many uh convenience appliances and whatnot and
sw4565A-ms98-a-0004 16.276750 21.044750 we don't even have to cook dinner anymore uh
sw4565A-ms98-a-0005 21.044750 34.200875 but i uh i've heard i don't know this for a fact but i've heard that a lot of families really don't spend a great deal of time together that ki[ds]- the kids maybe on the average get
sw4565A-ms98-a-0006 34.200875 40.570375 uh something like thirty seconds of quality time with the parents
sw4565A-ms98-a-0007 40.570375 41.858250 [silence]
sw4565A-ms98-a-0008 41.858250 53.292000 it seems bizarre to me i don't quite understand it although i think probably the the worst thing that's happening in the world at least the modern world today is [noise] television
sw4565A-ms98-a-0009 53.292000 54.311875 [silence]
sw4565A-ms98-a-0010 54.311875 59.357375 [noise] not so much because uh it's bad per se
sw4565A-ms98-a-0011 59.357375 65.618875 although there is some pretty crappy programming and i thin[k]- there's also some uh i think
sw4565A-ms98-a-0012 65.618875 68.055250 um
sw4565A-ms98-a-0013 68.055250 76.729750 [noise] poorer lifestyles illustrated but simply because it dominates so much discussionary time
sw4565A-ms98-a-0014 76.729750 80.364125 it's so darned easy to turn the thing on
sw4565A-ms98-a-0015 80.364125 84.982500 [silence]
sw4565A-ms98-a-0016 84.982500 88.752375 so i refuse to have one in the house yeah

sw4565A-ms98-a-0021 101.752875 105.552000 [silence]
sw4565A-ms98-a-0022 105.552000 113.108250 well i'll tell you television sure makes child rearing easy on you i mean the kids can be a real pest uh
sw4565A-ms98-a-0023 113.108250 118.139875 and turning the TV on is almost like magic you know it's uh like
sw4565A-ms98-a-0024 118.139875 123.651625 sticking uh an electrode into their pleasure center and you don't have to worry about them_1
sw4565A-ms98-a-0025 123.651625 128.003875 but i don't think it's too good
sw4565A-ms98-a-0026 128.003875 129.301875 [silence]
sw4565A-ms98-a-0027 129.301875 136.866875 um so you know i don't know i take advantage i don't have a great deal of time to spend with the kids but i take advantage of
sw4565A-ms98-a-0028 136.866875 140.368750 um dinner time we always eat together and
sw4565A-ms98-a-0029 140.368750 145.454000 you know whenever you're with your kids you wanna interact with them rather than just ignore them
sw4565A-ms98-a-0030 145.454000 149.533500 [silence]
sw4565A-ms98-a-0031 149.533500 158.904250 uh i guess our big outlet is music um our thirteen year old son plays violin and our nine year old daughter plays cello
sw4565A-ms98-a-0032 158.904250 167.420625 and uh when our son started playing violin i took up violin and when our daughter started playing cello i took up cello so there's plenty of
sw4565A-ms98-a-0033 167.420625 174.001125 plenty of interactive time in uh practicing although neither kid likes to practice
sw4565A-ms98-a-0034 174.001125 176.764875 i guess that's not a big surprise
sw4565A-ms98-a-0035 176.764875 177.832875 [silence]
sw4565A-ms98-a-0036 177.832875 182.240875 but i mea[n]- i imagine with infants you [noise] are
sw4565A-ms98-a-0037 182.240875 187.158625 [noise] most of your time is sort of spent taking care of them rather than interacting with them
