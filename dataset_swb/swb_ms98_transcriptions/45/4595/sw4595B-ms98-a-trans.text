sw4595B-ms98-a-0003 1.247125 13.703000 um i don't know uh regarding um should the judge [noise] do the sentencing or not i think the judge should have some i[n]- influence but i don't think the judge sh[ould]- i think that's too much
sw4595B-ms98-a-0004 13.703000 16.969875 power in the control of one person
sw4595B-ms98-a-0005 16.969875 30.132375 it uh it just doesn't seem to make sense that if the trial is by a jury of your peers that the sentencing should be somewhat along that i you know i guess the judge should give the parameters
sw4595B-ms98-a-0006 30.132375 36.284375 and then the jury should work kind of within there and if they feel exceptional one way or the other do you know what i mean
sw4595B-ms98-a-0007 36.284375 40.110375 [silence]

sw4595B-ms98-a-0011 48.873625 63.176000 it seems to granted you're found guilty or innocent by a a group of p[eers]- of your peers but then the punishment you know can be very very severe depending on the the judge's personal uh predilection to that
sw4595B-ms98-a-0012 63.176000 66.465625 [silence]
sw4595B-ms98-a-0013 66.465625 68.119375 right

sw4595B-ms98-a-0017 78.095625 86.684250 right i mean they're human they're gonna have their their pet peeves and they're gonna have the things that they really care about or don't care about
sw4595B-ms98-a-0018 86.684250 93.472125 um so let a group of people ha[ve]- you know try to try to m[ake]- m[ake]- you know use that uh make that decision
sw4595B-ms98-a-0019 93.472125 96.148125 [silence]
sw4595B-ms98-a-0020 96.148125 100.952750 unfortunately though it does string out the uh process but you know

sw4595B-ms98-a-0024 114.263375 124.735250 right see i i also think there's a problem with the plea bargaining system in our in our country in that you can uh plead to even though you're guilty as sin
sw4595B-ms98-a-0025 124.735250 127.510000 excuse me you plead to a lesser crime
sw4595B-ms98-a-0026 127.510000 130.839625 i think that that in of itself is a sin

sw4595B-ms98-a-0049 222.379875 237.137875 [silence]
sw4595B-ms98-a-0050 237.137875 238.628875 oh
sw4595B-ms98-a-0051 238.628875 252.754375 see y[eah]- yeah i have to i agree with that there are worse things that people have been getting off with but i don't think that that we then should have Leona get off i think that they should be hit even harder see i'm an advocate of the death penalty myself
sw4595B-ms98-a-0052 252.754375 261.672500 now i don't know of a lot of people that are well there are and there aren't and i just happen to feel that if somebody does the crime
sw4595B-ms98-a-0053 261.672500 266.153625 i mean if they murder somebody they take someone's life
sw4595B-ms98-a-0054 266.153625 275.891500 i just don't feel like i have to pay my tax dollars to have them in jail i- y[eah]- i just it's a tough line
sw4595B-ms98-a-0055 275.891500 284.858500 but i don't think the way we're executing the the capital punishment is is a deterrent although i think capital punishment is a deterrent
sw4595B-ms98-a-0056 284.858500 291.959750 if it's done right and that means that this is the way it is no ifs no ands no buts a certain
sw4595B-ms98-a-0057 291.959750 298.914000 right a certain number of appeals and then that's it don't stretch it out for years get it over with and get it done
