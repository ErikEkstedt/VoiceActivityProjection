sw4595A-ms98-a-0003 1.450250 16.103625 [silence]
sw4595A-ms98-a-0004 16.103625 19.465750 i agree i really agree with that
sw4595A-ms98-a-0005 19.465750 23.517500 [silence]
sw4595A-ms98-a-0006 23.517500 24.868000 right
sw4595A-ms98-a-0007 24.868000 27.433500 [silence]
sw4595A-ms98-a-0008 27.433500 28.941000 r[ight]- right
sw4595A-ms98-a-0009 28.941000 34.497625 [silence]
sw4595A-ms98-a-0010 34.497625 45.963375 right right yes i do i i have been thinking about this you're about the tenth person they tried to [laughter-call] for this [laughter] so i've had lots of time to think but yes i do because um
sw4595A-ms98-a-0011 45.963375 49.883375 otherwise why have a jury that's the point right ye[ah]-
sw4595A-ms98-a-0012 49.883375 61.122875 [silence]
sw4595A-ms98-a-0013 61.122875 74.901250 right right i think that you get a much fairer deal with a jury than you do with a judge and that's that's been [laughter-my] [laughter-experience] and and i really think that i think that judges are very prejudice
sw4595A-ms98-a-0014 74.901250 79.336000 to just their own idea and they wanna get it over with
sw4595A-ms98-a-0015 79.336000 81.497500 uh-huh
sw4595A-ms98-a-0016 81.497500 85.981750 [silence]
sw4595A-ms98-a-0017 85.981750 87.527250 right
sw4595A-ms98-a-0018 87.527250 92.507875 [silence]
sw4595A-ms98-a-0019 92.507875 96.740750 yeah i would feel much more confident if that were me so
sw4595A-ms98-a-0020 96.740750 99.019250 [silence]
sw4595A-ms98-a-0021 99.019250 107.416625 well it does but i think it's because people are trying to be conscientious where a judge it's their job and
sw4595A-ms98-a-0022 107.416625 115.397250 y[ou]- they just wanna speed it along and get it done and i don't think they stop and think about that individual as much as a group of people would
sw4595A-ms98-a-0023 115.397250 116.917625 yeah
sw4595A-ms98-a-0024 116.917625 118.696750 [silence]
sw4595A-ms98-a-0025 118.696750 121.291375 [laughter-yes] yes
sw4595A-ms98-a-0026 121.291375 124.338250 [silence]
sw4595A-ms98-a-0027 124.338250 125.632000 yes
sw4595A-ms98-a-0028 125.632000 126.781875 [silence]
sw4595A-ms98-a-0029 126.781875 128.813375 yes yes
sw4595A-ms98-a-0030 128.813375 129.862125 [silence]
sw4595A-ms98-a-0031 129.862125 133.799000 i think that we're having a lot of problems um
sw4595A-ms98-a-0032 133.799000 146.975000 with just everything and the whole the whole system is bugging me it really is our jails are over crowded with people like Leona Helmsley who's seventy two years old and with a blank check in front of her
sw4595A-ms98-a-0033 146.975000 158.241625 i don't think should go to jail i think the punishment should fit the crime i think that the jail should be filled with real criminals that are dangerous and i don't think they should get out on parole in three years
sw4595A-ms98-a-0034 158.241625 161.767250 i think they should [laughter-stay] there they did it they stay
sw4595A-ms98-a-0035 161.767250 167.378875 and people with traffic tickets and that there's another way to handle that i think
sw4595A-ms98-a-0036 167.378875 168.647875 so
sw4595A-ms98-a-0037 168.647875 183.234000 [silence]
sw4595A-ms98-a-0038 183.234000 192.216875 well yes but if you look at it in relation to the amount i mean it's one million dollars which to you and i sound exorbitant
sw4595A-ms98-a-0039 192.216875 200.774375 but compared to the six hundred million that they paid in five years that's like one dollar when we owe six hundred
sw4595A-ms98-a-0040 200.774375 202.257750 so
sw4595A-ms98-a-0041 202.257750 203.878000 [silence]
sw4595A-ms98-a-0042 203.878000 209.453500 they paid tax[es]- six hundred million in taxes over that five year period
sw4595A-ms98-a-0043 209.453500 215.969375 yeah so if you look at it they don't say that [noise] very much in the newspaper
sw4595A-ms98-a-0044 215.969375 221.135750 [silence]
sw4595A-ms98-a-0045 221.135750 226.470750 well possibly you know i don't know but if they're willing to correct it
sw4595A-ms98-a-0046 226.470750 240.866875 i- i don't i don't see that she belongs in jail the same as somebody who goes out and kills and walks away i mean i there are worse things that people are getting off with you know that kind of thing
sw4595A-ms98-a-0047 240.866875 242.584500 yeah
sw4595A-ms98-a-0048 242.584500 255.984875 [silence]
sw4595A-ms98-a-0049 255.984875 257.620375 well
sw4595A-ms98-a-0050 257.620375 260.898250 [silence]
sw4595A-ms98-a-0051 260.898250 262.292750 yeah
sw4595A-ms98-a-0052 262.292750 264.794000 [silence]
sw4595A-ms98-a-0053 264.794000 267.031375 get them out of society
sw4595A-ms98-a-0054 267.031375 268.371375 yeah
sw4595A-ms98-a-0055 268.371375 270.659750 [silence]
sw4595A-ms98-a-0056 270.659750 274.543875 i know i agree with you agree and
sw4595A-ms98-a-0057 274.543875 283.841500 [silence]
sw4595A-ms98-a-0058 283.841500 285.555500 i do too
sw4595A-ms98-a-0059 285.555500 288.503500 [silence]
sw4595A-ms98-a-0060 288.503500 290.102125 yeah
sw4595A-ms98-a-0061 290.102125 293.019375 it has to be a consistent thing
sw4595A-ms98-a-0062 293.019375 294.435000 yeah
sw4595A-ms98-a-0063 294.435000 296.116000 um-hum
