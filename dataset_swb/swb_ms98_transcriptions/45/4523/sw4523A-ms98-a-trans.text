sw4523A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.468875 [noise]
sw4523A-ms98-a-0002 0.468875 6.095625 so uh i i guess it's subject is uh gun control
sw4523A-ms98-a-0003 6.095625 18.371875 [silence]
sw4523A-ms98-a-0004 18.371875 20.072125 um-hum
sw4523A-ms98-a-0005 20.072125 43.745500 [silence] 
sw4523A-ms98-a-0006 43.745500 51.664875 um-hum yeah i sort of believe the same way i think i'm i'm probably considered more of a conservative but i still think that uh
sw4523A-ms98-a-0007 51.664875 55.142125 uh with regards to gun control the
sw4523A-ms98-a-0008 55.142125 62.589500 uh like convicted felons you know they shouldn't be able to have one um also i'm in
sw4523A-ms98-a-0009 62.589500 71.773250 if i[f]- if you look at it uh like say a waiting period i'm in favor of a waiting period as just that a waiting period before
sw4523A-ms98-a-0010 71.773250 84.238750 someone buys a a handgun and like i say a week or two weeks as a cooling off period but uh i- i guess the uh NRA they kind of look at it as a springboard towards more restrictive gun controls and
sw4523A-ms98-a-0011 84.238750 90.063500 so i can kind of see both both sides o[f]- of the of the uh issue on that
sw4523A-ms98-a-0012 90.063500 95.714500 [silence]
sw4523A-ms98-a-0013 95.714500 97.343125 um-hum

sw4523A-ms98-a-0022 141.090500 146.197625 [silence]
sw4523A-ms98-a-0023 146.197625 157.004375 yeah that that is true um as a as a toy you know i mean if you call a gun a toy they would be it would be interesting to have one shoot one but uh
sw4523A-ms98-a-0024 157.004375 162.056750 but you're right there's no no real legitimate need for one unless you consider
sw4523A-ms98-a-0025 162.056750 163.618500 um
sw4523A-ms98-a-0026 163.618500 171.219500 like personal defense like if your home or something that's it's kind of extreme i- i don't personally own one but uh
sw4523A-ms98-a-0027 171.219500 175.099500 it's it's really it really is a touchy issue i know uh
sw4523A-ms98-a-0028 175.099500 179.465375 the uh like you mentioned the plastic handguns the Glock
sw4523A-ms98-a-0029 179.465375 190.328500 it seems to me like like that that weapon they could it s[eems]- it seems to me like they could bypass all the i- i think the um the major concern is is that they think
sw4523A-ms98-a-0030 190.328500 199.908250 that it can be slipped through airport security like it it say invisible X rays seems to me like technically that'd be very simple to solve just put some sort of a
sw4523A-ms98-a-0031 199.908250 213.041375 uh a metal f[lake]- flake or something that would show up on on X rays you know it to show the outline of the gun and then you'd still have the advantages of the gun which is i believe light weight and uh it would
sw4523A-ms98-a-0032 213.041375 225.902875 [silence]
sw4523A-ms98-a-0033 225.902875 227.895500 uh-huh

sw4523A-ms98-a-0037 265.299875 278.394750 [laughter] [laughter-yeah] [noise] [laughter] yeah it's uh the [laughter-NRA] they're uh they're almost a little too radical in the other extreme i'm i'm i'm pretty strong in favor of of personal gun ownership
sw4523A-ms98-a-0038 278.394750 285.791500 but they uh they might even [laughter-get] [laughter-a] [laughter-little] [laughter-carried] [laughter-away] you know with the lobbying and and whatnot but
