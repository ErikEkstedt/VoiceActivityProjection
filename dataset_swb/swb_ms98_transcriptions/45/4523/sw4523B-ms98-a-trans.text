sw4523B-ms98-a-0003 7.387125 16.887250 yeah i um probably would put myself on a um five or six scale being up here in the uh northeast um
sw4523B-ms98-a-0004 16.887250 30.351125 i'm considered liberal [laughter] but uh i believe in the right to own and uh have a gun for yourself if that's what if that's what you want as long as you don't have a record
sw4523B-ms98-a-0005 30.351125 39.502750 in the past of um committing crimes or uh something in that order i think that it's important that there be some check
sw4523B-ms98-a-0006 39.502750 45.202500 um background checks before they just hand a gun over to any old person
sw4523B-ms98-a-0007 45.202500 87.423375 [silence] 
sw4523B-ms98-a-0008 87.423375 93.520375 yeah absolutely you know th[at's]- that's the one concern that uh i have too is that
sw4523B-ms98-a-0009 93.520375 106.590250 you know once you go down the path and you start with first it's it's background checks and and uh then it's suddenly age restrictions and then it's totally illegal [laughter]
sw4523B-ms98-a-0010 106.590250 115.080375 and you know i- i come from up here i'm not in New York City area by any means so i'm in a a Rochester's not heavy crime area
sw4523B-ms98-a-0011 115.080375 122.198375 but um you know and i and it's been a political issue up here um a a big deal about whether or not
sw4523B-ms98-a-0012 122.198375 129.436750 they should people should have access to handguns and uh some of these Saturday night specials and plastic handguns and
sw4523B-ms98-a-0013 129.436750 140.334250 all of these new things i think pretty much up here everybody agrees that [noise] there should be more control on semiautomatic slash keeping automatic weapons banned
sw4523B-ms98-a-0014 140.334250 149.460625 um just because you know what kind of legitimate hunting use can you do with an AK-47 [laughter-i] [laughter-mean] [laughter]

sw4523B-ms98-a-0019 211.493875 222.349125 yeah up here you know we have a lot of hunters up here if you go just to the south of uh Rochester here you have a bunch of state parks and there's a lot of hunting that goes on and uh
sw4523B-ms98-a-0020 222.349125 226.946500 that i think is by far the majority of people that own guns around here
sw4523B-ms98-a-0021 226.946500 233.160000 tend to either be hunters or they live in the inner city and they're concerned about um uh their safety
sw4523B-ms98-a-0022 233.160000 240.070750 um we've had up here the NRA's main focus up here has been on protecting the hunting
sw4523B-ms98-a-0023 240.070750 251.473875 uh the people who are doing a lot of hunting because being not a large urban area like New York City where you have an NRA movement that's more um attuned to personal protection
sw4523B-ms98-a-0024 251.473875 259.729125 versus hunting um that's pretty much how they've gone about it up here and some of the tactics i mean i noticed they changed their commercials
sw4523B-ms98-a-0025 259.729125 272.217750 um used to be [laughter-they'd] [laughter-mention] [laughter-and] with every membership you get fifty thousand dollars dismemberment [laughter-insurance] [laughter]
