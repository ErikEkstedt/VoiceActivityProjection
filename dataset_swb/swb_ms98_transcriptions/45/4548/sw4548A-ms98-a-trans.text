sw4548A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.368625 [noise] well actually uh
sw4548A-ms98-a-0002 1.368625 3.615250 i i don't think i'm in the uh
sw4548A-ms98-a-0003 3.615250 16.063625 uh majority of in in Texas i don't think i agree with no uh i wouldn't say that i think i would have said that a few years ago when i was younger i thought it was a
sw4548A-ms98-a-0004 16.063625 21.467875 a sign of a civilized society if you didn't have uh capital punishment but
sw4548A-ms98-a-0005 21.467875 26.489625 um uh maybe slowly changing my opinion
sw4548A-ms98-a-0006 26.489625 27.842125 i'm not
sw4548A-ms98-a-0007 27.842125 30.308875 thoroughly opposed to it i still think it's
sw4548A-ms98-a-0008 30.308875 32.110125 sort of true that a
sw4548A-ms98-a-0009 32.110125 38.984000 a more civilized society wouldn't have to use capital punishment but i'm beginning to believe this is less civilized society than i thought [laughter]
sw4548A-ms98-a-0010 38.984000 42.688375 uh-huh
sw4548A-ms98-a-0011 42.688375 79.939375 [silence]

sw4548A-ms98-a-0016 95.316500 96.183875 yeah
sw4548A-ms98-a-0017 96.183875 100.268250 i certainly don't uh advocate turning people like that loose
sw4548A-ms98-a-0018 100.268250 103.888375 i'm not sure executing them uh
sw4548A-ms98-a-0019 103.888375 107.980750 does anymore than keeping them in jail but uh
sw4548A-ms98-a-0020 107.980750 109.251125 [noise]
sw4548A-ms98-a-0021 109.251125 111.553625 yeah that's a factor
sw4548A-ms98-a-0022 111.553625 133.638250 [silence]
sw4548A-ms98-a-0023 133.638250 134.618500 uh-huh

sw4548A-ms98-a-0029 144.691625 145.759750 yeah
sw4548A-ms98-a-0030 145.759750 150.767375 well i the cost is something but it's i think it's relatively unimportant compared to
sw4548A-ms98-a-0031 150.767375 152.809500 what's the most effective way of
sw4548A-ms98-a-0032 152.809500 156.285500 dealing with crime and i guess uh
sw4548A-ms98-a-0033 156.285500 165.749125 i would like i don't know the European countries certainly uh none of them have capital punishment and they don't have a they don't have a crime problem either no you can't they don't execute anybody in Britain
sw4548A-ms98-a-0034 165.749125 174.855250 or France and i don't believe they do in Germany or Italy either [noise] and they don't have the crime problems we do i don't really think that there is too much of a relationship between the two
sw4548A-ms98-a-0035 174.855250 178.333875 i guess what worries me about capital punishment is uh
sw4548A-ms98-a-0036 178.333875 181.849000 when i see people enthusiastic about it and uh
sw4548A-ms98-a-0037 181.849000 182.765000 uh
sw4548A-ms98-a-0038 182.765000 190.322625 sort of bloodthirsty i think it brings out the worst in the in the people who do the punishing and the that that bothers me but it but uh

sw4548A-ms98-a-0048 211.108000 217.460125 well actually i wha[t]- the other thing that bothers me is when it becomes a political issue because i don't really think it uh
sw4548A-ms98-a-0049 217.460125 220.492875 i don't really think it's a s[ubject]- um
sw4548A-ms98-a-0050 220.492875 231.709125 very important aspect of fighting crime or law and order or anything else i think it just becomes a uh [noise] symbolic i'm tougher than you are type of emotional issue for politicians so
sw4548A-ms98-a-0051 231.709125 244.280625 i would like for it to be settled once for all and uh get in the background while the more important issues get discussed uh uh like i said some years ago i think i would have said there's no place for capital punishment in the
sw4548A-ms98-a-0052 244.280625 254.467875 civilized western country now i'm i'm not so sure of that i'm i i wouldn't vote against somebody just because it was for capital punishment and nor nor the other way around [noise]

sw4548A-ms98-a-0054 257.344500 260.945000 uh i guess i'm i'm my view of
sw4548A-ms98-a-0055 260.945000 262.542125 [noise] uh
sw4548A-ms98-a-0056 262.542125 267.533125 my i'm beginning to believe that some people are simply not rehabilitatable and uh 
sw4548A-ms98-a-0057 267.533125 269.182750 that uh
sw4548A-ms98-a-0058 269.182750 270.594125 uh
sw4548A-ms98-a-0059 270.594125 283.269625 costs and other factors justify uh um executing people maybe it's more a symbolic gesture that um um than anything else and uh
sw4548A-ms98-a-0060 283.269625 286.721750 i've also never been a victim although i have some
sw4548A-ms98-a-0061 286.721750 290.203250 i have two friends whose wives were murdered and uh
sw4548A-ms98-a-0062 290.203250 292.302750 i can imagine that uh
sw4548A-ms98-a-0063 292.302750 296.988625 uh for some people it would be the only form of justice in that case
sw4548A-ms98-a-0064 296.988625 299.714000 [silence]
