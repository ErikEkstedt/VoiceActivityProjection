sw4512A-ms98-a-0013 78.237375 84.177750 uh ballot i think there w[e]- that we will have the larger percentage of voter turnout than usual
sw4512A-ms98-a-0014 84.177750 91.942875 but i- i think it's pathetic that only half of the people in the country that are eligible tend to vote in the national elections
sw4512A-ms98-a-0015 91.942875 102.689875 i and i think it represents uh malaise due to well my vote doesn't count it doesn't matter anyway it's it's really i think it's more of a problem in the local elections
sw4512A-ms98-a-0016 102.689875 128.085875 [silence]
sw4512A-ms98-a-0017 128.085875 133.425875 i it's it's too bad i you have more control over your local politicians

sw4512A-ms98-a-0025 199.474625 209.498375 well i- i think in your case college students in general pretend not to pay that much attention to the local politics i think they've got enough going on [laughter]
sw4512A-ms98-a-0026 209.498375 211.924875 that's not a part of your world
