sw4588B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.022250 [noise]
sw4588B-ms98-a-0002 1.022250 2.640500 [silence]
sw4588B-ms98-a-0003 2.640500 11.661625 well uh interestingly enough i've been reading in the paper about uh the option that says basically none of the above
sw4588B-ms98-a-0004 11.661625 24.709875 a[nd]- and uh given the choices that's sometimes how i feel i generally support President Bush and i feel like he gets a lot of bad press you know the the economy is really not his fault i don't think
sw4588B-ms98-a-0005 24.709875 29.513000 but uh as far as anybody else running i think
sw4588B-ms98-a-0006 29.513000 36.182250 wow [laughter] is this the best we have to offer two hundred fifty million people to choose from and this is what we get
sw4588B-ms98-a-0007 36.182250 48.721375 [silence]
sw4588B-ms98-a-0008 48.721375 55.991125 yeah what i heard this morning is that although he has dropped out he's still got a lot of support in New York apparently
sw4588B-ms98-a-0009 55.991125 68.546250 and t[oday]- t[oday]- you know it today is uh the New York primary and they seem to be saying that if he got a good he's still on the ballot in New York and they said if he got a good showing in New York then he would jump back in 
sw4588B-ms98-a-0010 68.546250 87.253500 [silence]
sw4588B-ms98-a-0011 87.253500 93.206000 [noise] well [laughter] obviously he thought they weren't too good if he if he backed out
sw4588B-ms98-a-0012 93.206000 94.835625 uh
sw4588B-ms98-a-0013 94.835625 98.762125 i don't know maybe you know New York is a big primary
sw4588B-ms98-a-0014 98.762125 106.759625 and there are a lot of others still to come maybe he feels like if he can carry New York strongly then he could still make it
sw4588B-ms98-a-0015 106.759625 108.236750 [silence]
sw4588B-ms98-a-0016 108.236750 111.116750 but uh i don't know
sw4588B-ms98-a-0017 111.116750 116.211250 [silence]
sw4588B-ms98-a-0018 116.211250 118.096625 uh
sw4588B-ms98-a-0019 118.096625 119.801750 [silence]
sw4588B-ms98-a-0020 119.801750 127.108750 it's hard to say it's nice to get somebody in there i would certainly never vote for him as far as i know
sw4588B-ms98-a-0021 127.108750 136.322375 but it it's nice to have somebody else bring some issues to the front and at least ask the President some questions and have him have to defend himself
sw4588B-ms98-a-0022 136.322375 144.789625 so i think in that sense it's good i don't think that uh he's experienced enough to do the job uh
sw4588B-ms98-a-0023 144.789625 154.383000 on the other hand maybe he is i mean [laughter] the newspaper men tell us all the politics anyway so maybe he can just go ahead and keep doing it
sw4588B-ms98-a-0024 154.383000 156.217625 how about you
sw4588B-ms98-a-0025 156.217625 163.139625 [silence]
sw4588B-ms98-a-0026 163.139625 164.391750 yeah
sw4588B-ms98-a-0027 164.391750 179.274625 [silence]
sw4588B-ms98-a-0028 179.274625 180.781000 um-hum
sw4588B-ms98-a-0029 180.781000 188.866000 [silence]
sw4588B-ms98-a-0030 188.866000 198.385250 [noise] well when you look at it too how much does the Gulf War really count i mean how for example how much has it helped us as as a people
sw4588B-ms98-a-0031 198.385250 209.007875 i'm sure that we can say it helped the uh enemy rate of Kuwait um and uh sure it shook a peo[ple]- a few people up in Iraq but
sw4588B-ms98-a-0032 209.007875 214.437500 i[s]- is that a success or is that just sort of uh part of the job description as far as the President goes
sw4588B-ms98-a-0033 214.437500 219.150375 [silence]
sw4588B-ms98-a-0034 219.150375 220.506500 yeah
sw4588B-ms98-a-0035 220.506500 231.440000 [silence]
sw4588B-ms98-a-0036 231.440000 236.842000 oh yeah yeah his his popularity was somewhere close to ninety percent at the time
sw4588B-ms98-a-0037 236.842000 238.054375 and it
sw4588B-ms98-a-0038 238.054375 244.768625 [silence]
sw4588B-ms98-a-0039 244.768625 246.395000 yeah
sw4588B-ms98-a-0040 246.395000 248.109250 uh-huh
sw4588B-ms98-a-0041 248.109250 256.642625 [silence]
sw4588B-ms98-a-0042 256.642625 260.173875 a very minuscule portion so what about Libya
sw4588B-ms98-a-0043 260.173875 262.135625 yeah
sw4588B-ms98-a-0044 262.135625 265.125250 you you've heard of the goings on there i guess
sw4588B-ms98-a-0045 265.125250 290.990625 [silence]
sw4588B-ms98-a-0046 290.990625 299.778000 i thought it was le[t]- i have to make sure i get the uh stories right because because there was also yesterday the attrac[t]- the attacks on the Embassy but now didn't Libya
