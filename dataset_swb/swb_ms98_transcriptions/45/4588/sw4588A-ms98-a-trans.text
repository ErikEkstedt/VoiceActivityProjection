sw4588A-ms98-a-0052 213.545125 228.402750 right uh wha[t]- what i mean is so that the strong sense of uh nationalism that occurred you know right after the war uh sort of heroized George Bush you know whether or not it was you know a success for us or whatnot [noise] he tended to come out of the out of the 
sw4588A-ms98-a-0053 228.402750 233.185875 experience you know as the great American hero and uh
