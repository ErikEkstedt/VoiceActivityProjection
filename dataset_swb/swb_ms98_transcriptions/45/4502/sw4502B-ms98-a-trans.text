sw4502B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.215125 [noise] like it
sw4502B-ms98-a-0002 1.215125 2.510375 yeah
sw4502B-ms98-a-0003 2.510375 6.200000 [silence]
sw4502B-ms98-a-0004 6.200000 19.964500 well Governor Mario the uh holy one [laughter] up here Mario Cuomo has been against capital punishment since he hit office here i'd say six years ago he's
sw4502B-ms98-a-0005 19.964500 26.646000 he's for the concept of um uh life in prison without parole
sw4502B-ms98-a-0006 26.646000 39.798500 and every single year up in here in New York state the uh gov[ernment]- the state assembly gets together and tries to pass a death penalty bill and every year he vetos it [laughter] and upsets people
sw4502B-ms98-a-0007 39.798500 47.122375 yeah he upsets people up here um every time he does it i don't what it is down in Florida these days
sw4502B-ms98-a-0008 47.122375 72.334375 [silence]
sw4502B-ms98-a-0009 72.334375 76.078000 yeah Mario up here is claiming that um
sw4502B-ms98-a-0010 76.078000 81.970250 the reason why he's against capital punishment is because to send these [vocalized-noise] things through the court system
sw4502B-ms98-a-0011 81.970250 90.843625 on appeal then another appeal then another appeal ends up costing the taxpayers more than just putting the guy away for the rest of his life with no chance of parole
sw4502B-ms98-a-0012 90.843625 94.234750 so you know i[f]- i[t]- if it comes down to a money issue
sw4502B-ms98-a-0013 94.234750 102.294875 i you know in that case then i'm all for putting them_1 behind bars as long as there's no chance of parole but you know what it's like when they
sw4502B-ms98-a-0014 102.294875 110.694000 yeah they fill the court th[ere]- the jails up and suddenly let them_1 go and they're back on the street we had this murder up here
sw4502B-ms98-a-0015 110.694000 115.949500 um Art Shawcross up in Rochester killed nineteen prostitutes up here
sw4502B-ms98-a-0016 115.949500 119.766125 and he was let out on parole from up in uh
sw4502B-ms98-a-0017 119.766125 122.747500 um Watertown and
sw4502B-ms98-a-0018 122.747500 123.886500 [noise]
sw4502B-ms98-a-0019 123.886500 125.474125 [silence]
sw4502B-ms98-a-0020 125.474125 130.151750 uh he was just well actually he it was on purpose i guess
sw4502B-ms98-a-0021 130.151750 141.479500 he was uh he was a real psycho though and uh as a matter of fact it this happened under Cuomo's watch so the Bush administration was thinking if Cuomo is going to run for President they were gonna do instead of
sw4502B-ms98-a-0022 141.479500 146.080125 yeah instead of Willie Horton now we have the Art Shawcross deal [laughter-you] [laughter-know]
sw4502B-ms98-a-0023 146.080125 153.235500 [noise] s[o]- so yeah i don't know what your feelings are about it being in Florida where you've had it before
sw4502B-ms98-a-0024 153.235500 206.352875 [silence]
sw4502B-ms98-a-0025 206.352875 212.172500 yeah well of course you know we have New York City up here i'm in being in Rochester we're kind of
sw4502B-ms98-a-0026 212.172500 217.217625 they consider us more in Canada [laughter-than] [laughter-in] [laughter-New] [laughter-York] [laughter-State] [laughter-area]
sw4502B-ms98-a-0027 217.217625 226.342125 but uh up here you know we have we don't have too many serious problems with crime but i know in New York City it was a real it's a big deal they would like to have it back 
sw4502B-ms98-a-0028 226.342125 232.743500 and uh [noise] i think it's gonna boil down to changing the governor if they really wanna put it through
sw4502B-ms98-a-0029 232.743500 238.234125 uh they're building more prisons up here to try and put people in Attica is not too far away
sw4502B-ms98-a-0030 238.234125 246.567750 from where we are and that's at capacity and of course you know New York City is just packed with criminals that have done everything
sw4502B-ms98-a-0031 246.567750 251.588375 so i you know i don't where it's going to go to in the end i just think that um
sw4502B-ms98-a-0032 251.588375 260.435250 i- i- i agree with you i'm not really that terribly against it as long as it looks like it's going to work and reduce the court load and [noise]
