sw4526A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.379875 [noise] all right do you have any
sw4526A-ms98-a-0002 1.379875 3.619625 uh strong feelings on schools
sw4526A-ms98-a-0003 3.619625 71.817000 [silence]
sw4526A-ms98-a-0004 71.817000 74.527000 i've i've uh
sw4526A-ms98-a-0005 74.527000 80.516125 h[eard]- heard the that proposed before and i'm not uh discounting it completely but
sw4526A-ms98-a-0006 80.516125 86.795375 the counter argument to that is that uh there are schools around that are uh
sw4526A-ms98-a-0007 86.795375 87.837250 [silence]
sw4526A-ms98-a-0008 87.837250 96.990250 private schools not necessarily uh parochial schools where the teachers are paid no more than they are in the public schools and they and their track records are much better
sw4526A-ms98-a-0009 96.990250 98.128375 [silence]
sw4526A-ms98-a-0010 98.128375 99.338500 uh
sw4526A-ms98-a-0011 99.338500 101.094375 the uh
sw4526A-ms98-a-0012 101.094375 102.676875 i[n]- in fact
sw4526A-ms98-a-0013 102.676875 106.560500 these days there's a lot of [noise] uh there a lot of
sw4526A-ms98-a-0014 106.560500 119.272500 uh Catholic and other parochial schools around that are not staffed by nuns and and i'm not a Catholic so but i was just reading about this and what they were the
sw4526A-ms98-a-0015 119.272500 124.562000 the argument that i've heard is that uh and i subscribe to some of it by the way
sw4526A-ms98-a-0016 124.562000 126.537875 that uh
sw4526A-ms98-a-0017 126.537875 136.021875 our schools are reflecting the same kind of mismanagement that uh lead to the demise of the Soviet Union and that is when you've got an absolute monopoly
sw4526A-ms98-a-0018 136.021875 144.929875 and uh you can't uh you know it's a one party system so to speak then what you're going to have is gross inefficiencies and nobody cares
sw4526A-ms98-a-0019 144.929875 154.609250 and reality uh uh is just not a market base system and i know i've been in the Orient for about three years and
sw4526A-ms98-a-0020 154.609250 160.960500 the public schools are not very good but the all all of the good schools are private schools over there
sw4526A-ms98-a-0021 160.960500 168.636625 and uh it's not that we're spending i i think that we're spending a lot of money uh relatively speaking on schools
sw4526A-ms98-a-0022 168.636625 169.904125 but uh
sw4526A-ms98-a-0023 169.904125 178.411375 as with other things you know it like De[troit]- Detroit or some of the other problems uh with De[troit]- it's not the worker it's the uh it's the management
sw4526A-ms98-a-0024 178.411375 184.450625 and uh management frankly just doesn't have to they don't have to compete these days
sw4526A-ms98-a-0025 184.450625 203.979250 [silence]
sw4526A-ms98-a-0026 203.979250 205.230125 yes
sw4526A-ms98-a-0027 205.230125 209.615750 [silence]
sw4526A-ms98-a-0028 209.615750 210.739125 [laughter-yeah]
sw4526A-ms98-a-0029 210.739125 211.983750 [laughter]
sw4526A-ms98-a-0030 211.983750 230.615875 [silence]
sw4526A-ms98-a-0031 230.615875 237.622125 yeah and and well i see that as a as what i consider the biggest problem uh
sw4526A-ms98-a-0032 237.622125 239.227625 as with
sw4526A-ms98-a-0033 239.227625 249.094125 with uh oh there there are other problems and number one it would be nice if if teachers got paid uh uh i i hate to see the
sw4526A-ms98-a-0034 249.094125 253.742250 how shall i say it the garbage the guys that collect garbage and and uh
sw4526A-ms98-a-0035 253.742250 254.952750 uh
sw4526A-ms98-a-0036 254.952750 260.101875 [laughter-yes] [laughter-you] [laughter-know] [laughter-well] the sanitation engineers that go out there with uh and [vocalized-noise] just lift uh
sw4526A-ms98-a-0037 260.101875 262.271250 [silence]
sw4526A-ms98-a-0038 262.271250 265.341500 i hate to see those guys get paid more than teachers
sw4526A-ms98-a-0039 265.341500 268.992875 and different teachers are uh under a lot more stress
sw4526A-ms98-a-0040 268.992875 272.874875 and don't get any tips at the end of the day at you know at Christmas time
sw4526A-ms98-a-0041 272.874875 279.002375 so uh uh from that st[andpoint]- and frankly the private school systems uh
sw4526A-ms98-a-0042 279.002375 284.801500 uh including colleges and things like that uh do quite well uh because there is a lot of competition
sw4526A-ms98-a-0043 284.801500 292.582625 and if somebody decides that they're going t[o]- if their decisions are out of step with reality uh pretty soon people don't stop going there
sw4526A-ms98-a-0044 292.582625 294.145125 and uh
sw4526A-ms98-a-0045 294.145125 298.626000 or they get a horrible reputation and they get this uh what do they call that uh
