sw4526B-ms98-a-0003 3.195000 11.416625 well um i think that uh the majority of the problem with the school system um 
sw4526B-ms98-a-0004 11.416625 23.737500 is similar to the majority of the problem in a lot of other areas in it's a question of economics and the school system is not designed to be successful um
sw4526B-ms98-a-0005 23.737500 27.092375 by that uh it's not really profitable
sw4526B-ms98-a-0006 27.092375 38.500875 for good teachers to be in the school systems uh if there are good school teachers good really qualified people as school teachers it's because they're dedicated not because they're rewarded for doing so
sw4526B-ms98-a-0007 38.500875 40.499125 um [noise]
sw4526B-ms98-a-0008 40.499125 46.331375 the sch[ool]- the public school system uh needs to be viewed i think kind of like
sw4526B-ms98-a-0009 46.331375 59.912875 the highways and hospitals and everything else it's part of the infrastructure it's something that has to be and has to be you know h[ighly]- highly maintained in order for the nation itself to be successful and when you um
sw4526B-ms98-a-0010 59.912875 71.606000 when you neglect part of the infrastructure be it the roads or the schools or whatever then everything kind of follows with that it's just a question of how long before you pay the price

sw4526B-ms98-a-0016 184.353875 189.887875 yeah i'd heard something as a matter of fact uh kind of along those lines with i think it was the New York school system
sw4526B-ms98-a-0017 189.887875 203.827375 where they suddenly instituted a sort of market system where um basically the kids were allowed to take whatever classes they wanted to and go to whatever school they wanted to and it was up to the schools to attract the kids
sw4526B-ms98-a-0018 203.827375 216.511875 um and offer stuff the kids wanted and what turned out happening this was like area of the country with the highest drop out rate and all this kind of stuff [noise] and what ended up happening is people didn't just take fun classes or anything like that uh it ended up that
sw4526B-ms98-a-0019 216.511875 225.903625 uh the rate of of graduating students went way way up and they ended up taking real courses but it was because they wanted to and because_1 they chose to instead of were being forced to and
sw4526B-ms98-a-0020 225.903625 231.230375 and the the people were forced to compete and and the good teachers were getting the students and that kind of stuff
