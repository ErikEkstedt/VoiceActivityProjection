sw4503A-ms98-a-0013 66.870125 78.660125 well apparently in your state there's more incentive to send your child to pub[lic]- uh to a private school because in New York you pay taxes for public schools and then if you wanna send your child to private school you pay again
sw4503A-ms98-a-0014 78.660125 79.952250 [vocalized-noise]
sw4503A-ms98-a-0015 79.952250 85.294625 [silence]
sw4503A-ms98-a-0016 85.294625 89.628500 oh okay i g[ot]- i got the impression you said the oil money paid for the schools so
sw4503A-ms98-a-0017 89.628500 91.310125 ah

sw4503A-ms98-a-0020 94.235000 103.120250 [silence]
sw4503A-ms98-a-0021 103.120250 104.520875 sure
sw4503A-ms98-a-0022 104.520875 105.748125 [silence]
sw4503A-ms98-a-0023 105.748125 113.853125 right i don't i don't have any experience myself with private schools so i really can't say they're better i did go to public schools
sw4503A-ms98-a-0024 113.853125 121.312875 and what i'm finding um right now i have two kids and i'm going back to work and i'm substitute teaching in public schools
sw4503A-ms98-a-0025 121.312875 128.800250 and what i see in the high school is i don't know that it's public private i think times have changed
sw4503A-ms98-a-0026 128.800250 135.187625 i mean i know that i would never not do my homework because lightning would strike me something terrible would happen
sw4503A-ms98-a-0027 135.187625 145.218625 but nowadays the kids don't do their work and they have the nerve to say to you so what are you gonna do and you're not gonna do anything
sw4503A-ms98-a-0028 145.218625 147.087875 but you
sw4503A-ms98-a-0029 147.087875 156.069875 yeah i think the most important thing that a public school can do to help the problem is to
sw4503A-ms98-a-0030 156.069875 167.294000 to maybe go backwards in some ways um i find the teachers trying to be like the kids uh telling their k[ids]- i teach art and they'll go yeah that's cool well
sw4503A-ms98-a-0031 167.294000 179.323000 maybe they should talk like grown-ups and the kids should learn to act like grown-ups instead of the [laughter-grown-ups] trying to act like the kids to get their acceptance i find the teachers are very concerned about being liked
sw4503A-ms98-a-0032 179.323000 191.669000 [noise] being being friends with them and you know they don't wanna be so strict they don't wanna be so hard on them and i find that the kids are not turning in quality work because there's nothing to impress upon them that they better
sw4503A-ms98-a-0033 191.669000 194.626375 and you know the k[ids]-
sw4503A-ms98-a-0034 194.626375 212.367125 [silence]
sw4503A-ms98-a-0035 212.367125 216.092125 [noise] well maybe they'll make them [vocalized-noise]
sw4503A-ms98-a-0036 216.092125 222.010875 well you know yeah well maybe they'll make them_1 stay home for a day but that's no [laughter-torture] [laughter-for] [laughter-a] [laughter-kid]
sw4503A-ms98-a-0037 222.010875 224.467625 [laughter]
sw4503A-ms98-a-0038 224.467625 235.597125 yeah and i know kids if they you know if they're late enough often enough they get a letter home and they get to the mail box before their parents because their parents work so you know it's not a problem and i find that you know
sw4503A-ms98-a-0039 235.597125 238.384625 [silence]
sw4503A-ms98-a-0040 238.384625 243.456500 um yeah well they they sent me yes that's true it progress reports
sw4503A-ms98-a-0041 243.456500 262.073125 [silence]
sw4503A-ms98-a-0042 262.073125 264.372000 oh sure they [laughter]
sw4503A-ms98-a-0043 264.372000 275.699250 yeah they never have homework they always did it in school i have a fourteen year old son who is just getting into you know realizing that he can dupe me [laughter-i] [laughter-think]
sw4503A-ms98-a-0044 275.699250 285.519750 but i- i think the the public school it's not that the teachers are inferior or that the materials are inferior i think what's going on is that
sw4503A-ms98-a-0045 285.519750 296.278250 the teachers have to be backed up when the kids don't do what they're supposed to do um the teachers have to have some way to
sw4503A-ms98-a-0046 296.278250 297.858000 they need the paren[tal]-
