sw4594A-ms98-a-0006 34.487250 37.251000 right and you make more money but it goes away anyway
sw4594A-ms98-a-0007 37.251000 47.971375 [silence]
sw4594A-ms98-a-0008 47.971375 57.161125 yeah i have three children and a house so uh it's a s[erious]- it's a serious matter but uh my wife's just starting to go back to work maybe that'll take the
sw4594A-ms98-a-0009 57.161125 66.213000 pressure off but i must [noise] i must confess the only control i have over our budget is to try and make as many things as constant as possible like
sw4594A-ms98-a-0010 66.213000 76.351000 tuition and try to make things monthly so that there are as few surprises as possible but i do[n't]- i've started keeping a budget on computer
sw4594A-ms98-a-0011 76.351000 87.012750 i guess each of the last five years and never followed through and about this time of year is when i get religion i have to do my income taxes i realize that better recording keeping would've helped and uh
sw4594A-ms98-a-0012 87.012750 91.223000 i still haven't managed to uh uh do it the way i should
sw4594A-ms98-a-0013 91.223000 101.940500 [silence]
sw4594A-ms98-a-0014 101.940500 103.192625 right
sw4594A-ms98-a-0015 103.192625 110.252375 [silence]
sw4594A-ms98-a-0016 110.252375 115.122250 right i believe if i had to that i could [noise] estimate
sw4594A-ms98-a-0017 115.122250 125.625000 all the major form all the major sources of spending uh on a monthly basis and come pretty close but i'm sure that there are a bunch of surprises in there that uh
sw4594A-ms98-a-0018 125.625000 133.384000 i would find and maybe learn how to control if i uh kept a formal budget or uh financial plan
sw4594A-ms98-a-0019 133.384000 135.699875 [noise] but
sw4594A-ms98-a-0020 135.699875 150.119000 [silence]
sw4594A-ms98-a-0021 150.119000 151.329125 yeah
sw4594A-ms98-a-0022 151.329125 169.552500 [silence]
sw4594A-ms98-a-0023 169.552500 181.855375 yeah the only problem is that if you have if you have children [noise] what you're gonna need for them a few years from now is what you need to be putting aside now and that's uh you can fool yourself if you don't set that up somehow
sw4594A-ms98-a-0024 181.855375 187.322625 [silence]
sw4594A-ms98-a-0025 187.322625 188.557875 right

sw4594A-ms98-a-0027 191.279375 192.476500 right
sw4594A-ms98-a-0028 192.476500 202.124875 but you'll find that the [noise] kids don't really have a very good sense of where the money is going and so they'll ask for things pretty much constantly [laughter]
sw4594A-ms98-a-0029 202.124875 216.601250 and i've i learned to say no pretty much constantly [laughter] and uh uh so i would be better if i had a budget and i had a certain amount of uh fun money that had to be spent each month or that was allowed to be spent each month i'd feel better about it [noise]
sw4594A-ms98-a-0030 216.601250 222.203000 so who knows maybe this'll get me to do it [laughter] [noise] you don't have children
sw4594A-ms98-a-0031 222.203000 227.919750 well that's a big change in life in a lot of ways but budgeting is one of them [laughter]

sw4594A-ms98-a-0036 236.280000 246.635125 [silence]
sw4594A-ms98-a-0037 246.635125 248.649375 [laughter]

sw4594A-ms98-a-0039 253.395250 261.994500 that's an interesting spirit but and i suppose cats are like children they don't take no for an answer [laughter] as easily [laughter] [noise]

sw4594A-ms98-a-0043 272.648500 283.117250 yeah the hard part though is not uh it the hard part is um um setting aside for what they're gonna need in five or ten years [noise] that's uh really difficult
sw4594A-ms98-a-0044 283.117250 285.464750 yep [noise]
sw4594A-ms98-a-0045 285.464750 287.360250 right
sw4594A-ms98-a-0046 287.360250 290.749125 well i've made my confession
sw4594A-ms98-a-0047 290.749125 292.047125 [silence]
sw4594A-ms98-a-0048 292.047125 293.201750 and
