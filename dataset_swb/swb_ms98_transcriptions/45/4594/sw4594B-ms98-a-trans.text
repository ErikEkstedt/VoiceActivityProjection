sw4594B-ms98-a-0007 35.397500 36.926000 [silence]

sw4594B-ms98-a-0020 91.196750 102.620500 yeah but even even if you do break your budget i think when you write things down or however if if you do it on the computer whatever or something where you can just constantly see exactly what where your money's going
sw4594B-ms98-a-0021 102.620500 111.305125 then you it's it's easier even if you don't stick to it i think it you know it's better to have you a little bit more conservative hm

sw4594B-ms98-a-0023 132.798625 134.307875 yeah
sw4594B-ms98-a-0024 134.307875 146.498250 but even i[f]- you can't i don't think have enou[gh]- a really when before when i had a strict budget it's because i had too i knew exactly [laughter-where] every penny was going before i had it but
sw4594B-ms98-a-0025 146.498250 150.565500 it's it's a little bit harder when you have a little bit more leeway
sw4594B-ms98-a-0026 150.565500 161.470750 but also it i think it's bad to have like you know say you have these debts and you you know you're paying a lot of interest on one and you wanna go ahead and get it you know paid off sometimes
sw4594B-ms98-a-0027 161.470750 171.341750 i've looked at it that way and really just you know pinched myself in other places so that i could do that you know uh pay it off and
