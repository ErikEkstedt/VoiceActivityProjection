sw4572A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.143875 [noise]
sw4572A-ms98-a-0002 0.143875 4.493625 so uh what things do you consider an invasion of privacy
sw4572A-ms98-a-0003 4.493625 11.787625 [silence]
sw4572A-ms98-a-0004 11.787625 15.614250 oh i don't i don't know i had a little bit more time to think about it i was thinking of like uh
sw4572A-ms98-a-0005 15.614250 17.251875 [noise]
sw4572A-ms98-a-0006 17.251875 20.149625 i don't know i st[arted]- i started to think about all the big
sw4572A-ms98-a-0007 20.149625 26.311375 you know data bases they have with all the information about you on them_1 like the credit reports and 
sw4572A-ms98-a-0008 26.311375 29.779625 and all those you know demographics studies that they do that
sw4572A-ms98-a-0009 29.779625 31.782125 um you know have
sw4572A-ms98-a-0010 31.782125 34.378375 who knows how much you know
sw4572A-ms98-a-0011 34.378375 37.359875 stuff about all the purchases that you've made and
sw4572A-ms98-a-0012 37.359875 39.989625 everything kept tract somewhere and
sw4572A-ms98-a-0013 39.989625 40.697250 [noise]
sw4572A-ms98-a-0014 40.697250 45.081625 i don't know i don't know how much the stuff actually what they actually have in there but
sw4572A-ms98-a-0015 45.081625 47.806000 i know they use that i mean they
sw4572A-ms98-a-0016 47.806000 49.357375 they sell those t[o]-
sw4572A-ms98-a-0017 49.357375 56.073000 [silence]
sw4572A-ms98-a-0018 56.073000 59.368250 yeah that was that w[as]- that was the other one i was thinking of
sw4572A-ms98-a-0019 59.368250 60.007500 [noise]
sw4572A-ms98-a-0020 60.007500 61.387500 i think that's uh
sw4572A-ms98-a-0021 61.387500 63.144250 [silence]
sw4572A-ms98-a-0022 63.144250 65.056750 i mean i know drugs are illegal
sw4572A-ms98-a-0023 65.056750 71.301500 [silence]
sw4572A-ms98-a-0024 71.301500 73.317875 uh uh-huh
sw4572A-ms98-a-0025 73.317875 80.443875 [silence]
sw4572A-ms98-a-0026 80.443875 81.695125 um-hum
sw4572A-ms98-a-0027 81.695125 97.444875 [silence]
sw4572A-ms98-a-0028 97.444875 98.710500 uh-huh
sw4572A-ms98-a-0029 98.710500 125.327500 [silence]
sw4572A-ms98-a-0030 125.327500 126.607500 um-hum
sw4572A-ms98-a-0031 126.607500 144.134375 [silence]
sw4572A-ms98-a-0032 144.134375 147.416750 um-hum [noise] well i i think that um
sw4572A-ms98-a-0033 147.416750 148.556625 [silence]
sw4572A-ms98-a-0034 148.556625 153.867375 i think that you know a person's competence should be more determined by
sw4572A-ms98-a-0035 153.867375 156.902125 you know their actions and their behavior and if they're
sw4572A-ms98-a-0036 156.902125 158.685875 you know if they're on some kind of
sw4572A-ms98-a-0037 158.685875 167.194750 you know controll[ed]- controlled substance then you know it kinds of takes away from the job of you know the supervisor or manager type person
sw4572A-ms98-a-0038 167.194750 173.169750 know who is able to evaluate them i think they should be evaluated that way rather than [noise] with a
sw4572A-ms98-a-0039 173.169750 175.564875 you know a chemical you know
sw4572A-ms98-a-0040 175.564875 188.488250 [silence]
sw4572A-ms98-a-0041 188.488250 192.837625 the people that are carriers and don't uh don't reveal it
sw4572A-ms98-a-0042 192.837625 201.458000 [silence]
sw4572A-ms98-a-0043 201.458000 205.081250 [laughter-yeah] that's that would be kind of an extreme
sw4572A-ms98-a-0044 205.081250 208.734375 i mean i've heard of things like you know making them_1
sw4572A-ms98-a-0045 208.734375 213.971000 you know uh marking them somehow or you know or something like that or
sw4572A-ms98-a-0046 213.971000 218.462250 you know putting them_1 all s[ome]- some place like in a kind of a
sw4572A-ms98-a-0047 218.462250 221.333375 [silence]
sw4572A-ms98-a-0048 221.333375 224.339375 yeah well i guess it kind of borders on where
sw4572A-ms98-a-0049 224.339375 225.783625 i mean
sw4572A-ms98-a-0050 225.783625 232.259125 what do you value more the invasion of uh the person's privacy or the possible danger to
sw4572A-ms98-a-0051 232.259125 234.479250 you know other people
sw4572A-ms98-a-0052 234.479250 242.219000 [silence]
sw4572A-ms98-a-0053 242.219000 243.536750 yeah
sw4572A-ms98-a-0054 243.536750 245.082750 [silence]
sw4572A-ms98-a-0055 245.082750 248.886500 i guess that's alway[s]- that's been the big role of government i guess
sw4572A-ms98-a-0056 248.886500 250.669125 i mean [vocalized-noise] generally
sw4572A-ms98-a-0057 250.669125 252.254375 [laughter-yeah]
sw4572A-ms98-a-0058 252.254375 253.416875 yeah
sw4572A-ms98-a-0059 253.416875 254.621000 well
sw4572A-ms98-a-0060 254.621000 259.687500 yeah that's kind of a difficult one to go into i mean that that particular case
sw4572A-ms98-a-0061 259.687500 265.009000 because i mean there's a lot of people that uh i mean they could require o[ne]- you know
sw4572A-ms98-a-0062 265.009000 276.834875 o[bligatory]- obligatory AIDS testing for everyone because i'm s[ure]- you know there's a huge part of the population not a huge part but a you know the the AIDS population i guess that have it that don't know they do
sw4572A-ms98-a-0063 276.834875 278.762625 an[d]- are spreading it
sw4572A-ms98-a-0064 278.762625 290.320750 but again to require you know such a test and jus[t]- and then to make make it known they have it is to subject them to to discrimi[natory]- discriminatory practices
sw4572A-ms98-a-0065 290.320750 292.202875 and other things
sw4572A-ms98-a-0066 292.202875 296.513125 i don't know uh i don't know how exactly i feel about that
sw4572A-ms98-a-0067 296.513125 298.562000 [silence]
