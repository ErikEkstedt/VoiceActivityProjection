sw4576A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.921375 [noise] -[o]kay i um
sw4576A-ms98-a-0002 1.921375 12.116625 to let you know what i feel about drug testing uh i have my qualms about having the government or anyone else for that matter
sw4576A-ms98-a-0003 12.116625 21.266000 testing randomly everybody across the board for various drugs however i am not against
sw4576A-ms98-a-0004 21.266000 34.009375 testing those people who are in critical uh jobs for example airline pilots subway drivers you know people who are responsible for other people's safety
sw4576A-ms98-a-0005 34.009375 36.066000 [silence]
sw4576A-ms98-a-0006 36.066000 37.147125 [noise]
sw4576A-ms98-a-0007 37.147125 39.762000 correct i just think that it's
sw4576A-ms98-a-0008 39.762000 51.453250 uh unnecessary and really the medical testing facilities that are available now have been shown to have problems in the past as far as reliability is concerned
sw4576A-ms98-a-0009 51.453250 57.135000 and uh we have had situations here where people were accused of um
sw4576A-ms98-a-0010 57.135000 65.355375 uh utilizing drugs and uh it turned out they were on some other medication which was giving false positives
sw4576A-ms98-a-0011 65.355375 69.067000 [silence]
sw4576A-ms98-a-0012 69.067000 70.102000 um-hum

sw4576A-ms98-a-0017 79.644750 83.329750 uh do you more or less follow on the same lines as i do or
sw4576A-ms98-a-0018 83.329750 106.142250 [silence]

sw4576A-ms98-a-0021 113.529750 118.280125 yeah i- i know that they were up here in New York um
sw4576A-ms98-a-0022 118.280125 126.131250 uh i've noticed what they have been trying to do the governor here isn't thrilled with the idea and we have uh
sw4576A-ms98-a-0023 126.131250 138.421750 various government officials here who basically don't feel that is a good idea for along the same lines but they're continuously clashing with the federal government which because of it's {antidrug} war
sw4576A-ms98-a-0024 138.421750 150.925500 um figures well since we're not really accomplishing much of [laughter-anything] [laughter-internationally] let's make big headlines by going out and being for mandatory drug testing and
sw4576A-ms98-a-0025 150.925500 159.410000 [noise] yeah and and that way we'll we'll nail those nine to five worker users without really solving the problem
sw4576A-ms98-a-0026 159.410000 164.469875 of trying to really do something and through education and that
sw4576A-ms98-a-0027 164.469875 170.666750 yeah they the federal government seems to be a lot more aggressive about this um
sw4576A-ms98-a-0028 170.666750 179.646375 than uh anything else it's interesting that you find out with all these little scandals going on now such as in the house with the post office cocaine scandal
sw4576A-ms98-a-0029 179.646375 181.653500 you know all that um
sw4576A-ms98-a-0030 181.653500 184.085500 [silence]

sw4576A-ms98-a-0038 205.752750 210.397625 hum well their sure they were probably afraid of being sued [laughter]

sw4576A-ms98-a-0042 215.239750 226.031250 [noise] yeah it's one of these slippery slope issues where once you start by allowing this kind of randomized drug testing it's the same thing with the lie detectors
sw4576A-ms98-a-0043 226.031250 237.061375 and uh the physiological tes[t]- [noise] tests that go on um really i think you know we are seeing more and more of privacy taken away
sw4576A-ms98-a-0044 237.061375 248.102625 um courtesy of the federal government as time goes on because of the almighty rights of the employer to know every possible thing about their employees
sw4576A-ms98-a-0045 248.102625 257.955250 and uh at times it's hypocritical as well because those in positions of leadership that want these things certainly don't want them applied to themselves [laughter]
sw4576A-ms98-a-0046 257.955250 258.806750 [laughter]

sw4576A-ms98-a-0048 261.952625 272.062125 yeah i- i- i don't know how much you've had experience as far as in the newspapers coming across people who have gotten into trouble with the drug stuff here in in Ro[chester]- Rochester
sw4576A-ms98-a-0049 272.062125 277.837625 in western New York there hasn't been a terrible lot but we of course hear about the subway drivers in New York City
sw4576A-ms98-a-0050 277.837625 286.903625 who slammed into someone and of course you know the airline pilots are rumored you know there are already rumors of rampant alcoholism now cocaine usage

sw4576A-ms98-a-0053 291.029250 299.330000 oh yeah wasn't that that thing in [vocalized-noise] Minneapolis or something when they were supposedly smashed out of their minds and then flew or they had their light
