sw2814A-ms98-a-0003 1.781375 6.152250 uh [noise] what have you had any home repairs done lately on your home
sw2814A-ms98-a-0004 6.152250 70.066250 [silence]
sw2814A-ms98-a-0005 70.066250 81.094750 yeah we uh [noise] of course we have a new house that we've uh that we bought about a year ago and it's been a chore just getting the uh builder to come back and finish everything up the way it's supposed to
sw2814A-ms98-a-0006 81.094750 82.704250 [silence]
sw2814A-ms98-a-0007 82.704250 95.389250 uh yeah it's been an experience [laughter] it's one i don't want to repeat anytime soon but we've had some we haven't had anything really major uh wrong other than uh we did have like a water leak in the wall in the in the garage and
sw2814A-ms98-a-0008 95.389250 103.608000 and uh the water heater upstairs in the attic it uh had a little leak and leaked down in uh under the ceiling
sw2814A-ms98-a-0009 103.608000 117.797000 and they had to come in and do some tape and bedding and repaint you know treat the ceiling but nothing nothing major those those kind of things really weren't major uh just some of those kind of things that can happen
sw2814A-ms98-a-0010 117.797000 122.399000 but uh just getting him out there to finish up and that sort of thing was has been a real effort
sw2814A-ms98-a-0011 122.399000 123.124625 [noise]
sw2814A-ms98-a-0012 123.124625 142.459875 [silence]
sw2814A-ms98-a-0013 142.459875 143.678375 uh-huh
sw2814A-ms98-a-0014 143.678375 153.771875 [silence]
sw2814A-ms98-a-0015 153.771875 156.240125 it's hard it's hard to make it fit perfectly
sw2814A-ms98-a-0016 156.240125 161.148625 [silence]
sw2814A-ms98-a-0017 161.148625 165.233250 well fortunately ours was on the ceiling where they had the blow in ceiling the little uh
sw2814A-ms98-a-0018 165.233250 176.701750 the little the little you know uh styrofoam balls that they paint over so it was easy to disguise that but uh it was in an area where you don't really look at very much so we were lucky in that respect
sw2814A-ms98-a-0019 176.701750 182.950375 [silence]
sw2814A-ms98-a-0020 182.950375 192.820875 no however i do think that a lot of times contractors try to get out of doing things that they say they're going to do and uh
sw2814A-ms98-a-0021 192.820875 200.137875 [silence]
sw2814A-ms98-a-0022 200.137875 205.700000 yeah and and then they don't do a real good job doing it too they just kind of get get it done as quickly as possible
sw2814A-ms98-a-0023 205.700000 244.469875 [silence]
sw2814A-ms98-a-0024 244.469875 257.148000 yeah they i- i like when they come in of course i designed my own house i'm i i've had prior experience in design and building and stuff like that so i know basically if it's done right the problem is i don't want to do anymore
sw2814A-ms98-a-0025 257.148000 259.667000 i want someone to do it for me
sw2814A-ms98-a-0026 259.667000 263.912750 and uh just trying to get them to do what they say they're going to do is a real effort
sw2814A-ms98-a-0027 263.912750 274.240000 [silence]
sw2814A-ms98-a-0028 274.240000 279.151625 well i could recommend something there if if you know if if it's not just cost prohibitive
sw2814A-ms98-a-0029 279.151625 285.438000 for you uh i've built probably three decks on three different houses
sw2814A-ms98-a-0030 285.438000 288.904625 and the first time i went with
sw2814A-ms98-a-0031 288.904625 290.730000 regular just treated pine
sw2814A-ms98-a-0032 290.730000 297.129875 kind of a womanized pine and then i- i tr[eated]- spray treated it with some um
sw2814A-ms98-a-0033 297.129875 303.096250 um panta oil which you have to do about every two years
sw2814A-ms98-a-0034 303.096250 308.562750 the problem with that is it warps after a couple of years then and you have to start replacing boards
sw2814A-ms98-a-0035 308.562750 314.260375 the second time i did it out of cedar which i soaked in Thompson Water Seal
sw2814A-ms98-a-0036 314.260375 319.970625 and that works fine but there again i[t]- it discolors real bad
sw2814A-ms98-a-0037 319.970625 331.453750 you know the sun and everything else it just makes it look gray and dull an and it doesn't look attractive after a a few years the wood lasts fine but the color i was real dissatisfied
sw2814A-ms98-a-0038 331.453750 340.267000 and if you can stand the additional expense which y[ou]- you'll recoup after a while because it will last forever is the redwood if you'll go with the redwood
sw2814A-ms98-a-0039 340.267000 349.905625 [silence]
sw2814A-ms98-a-0040 349.905625 353.040625 they're screws the self adhesive screws all right
sw2814A-ms98-a-0041 353.040625 364.025125 [silence]
sw2814A-ms98-a-0042 364.025125 372.669250 you have to pretty much spray them_1 regularly you know under an and around or whatever so you want to leave yourself uh enough space to get under it or or be able to lift it up
sw2814A-ms98-a-0043 372.669250 379.269375 on some ends a lot of times they won't even detach them to the ground they just lay them up on some cinder blocks underneath in the ground
sw2814A-ms98-a-0044 379.269375 384.709125 and they're heavy enough where they won't the wind won't pick them up or they won't shift if it's big enough and heavy enough
sw2814A-ms98-a-0045 384.709125 394.139500 so they're several ways of doing it but the redwood is by by far the best and i would and i would also insist on that they do treat that with Thompson's Water Seal
sw2814A-ms98-a-0046 394.139500 401.781500 [silence]
sw2814A-ms98-a-0047 401.781500 402.366500 yeah
sw2814A-ms98-a-0048 402.366500 413.936250 [silence]
sw2814A-ms98-a-0049 413.936250 414.572875 yeah
sw2814A-ms98-a-0050 414.572875 424.399875 [silence]
sw2814A-ms98-a-0051 424.399875 428.760000 well it is it's it's a frightening experience
sw2814A-ms98-a-0052 428.760000 434.340250 the one thing you might do if he will deliver the boards that he is going to make the under structure with
sw2814A-ms98-a-0053 434.340250 438.871750 before he starts doing the construction to go ahead and do the water seal
sw2814A-ms98-a-0054 438.871750 449.699250 on those and then when he cuts them_1 and puts them_1 together then that'll already be treated and a fast way of doing that if you'll go get a piece of guttering material like a little trough
sw2814A-ms98-a-0055 449.699250 454.202375 and co[ver]- cover both ends or some sort of something that that will fit in
sw2814A-ms98-a-0056 454.202375 455.479750 [silence]
sw2814A-ms98-a-0057 455.479750 456.688750 and
sw2814A-ms98-a-0058 456.688750 464.949000 pour that in pour the wa[ter]- Thompson's Water Seal in there and then just put that in there and turn them over several times and let them_1 set and soak in
sw2814A-ms98-a-0059 464.949000 466.389250 [silence]
sw2814A-ms98-a-0060 466.389250 471.762750 that's right that that works wonders it i know it takes a lot of extra time but it's it's by far worth it
sw2814A-ms98-a-0061 471.762750 475.377125 [silence]
sw2814A-ms98-a-0062 475.377125 478.974750 well over a period of time any any lumber will deteriorate
sw2814A-ms98-a-0063 478.974750 484.061250 now redwood would take quite a few years it depends on how many years you you plan to stay there
sw2814A-ms98-a-0064 484.061250 495.778625 but uh redwood even if you don't treat it properly will begin to discolor and will begin to degrade even though it will be strong structurally strong and and will be there for a lot longer
sw2814A-ms98-a-0065 495.778625 503.289625 [silence]
sw2814A-ms98-a-0066 503.289625 506.558250 actually if you do the the water seal correctly
sw2814A-ms98-a-0067 506.558250 508.043375 you don't even have to do that
sw2814A-ms98-a-0068 508.043375 516.253125 i've seen decks that are ten years old that uh that still have never had the had the uh the water proof stain put back over it or whatever
sw2814A-ms98-a-0069 516.253125 528.385375 and uh or they even have some rejuvenator that you can put on there that makes the redwood color come back but it's expensive and and and most cases if you do it properly it will not even be required
sw2814A-ms98-a-0070 528.385375 535.633500 [silence]
sw2814A-ms98-a-0071 535.633500 540.710000 yeah and and the Thompson's is is good because you can roll it on with a roller you can spray it on you can
sw2814A-ms98-a-0072 540.710000 546.270625 [silence]
sw2814A-ms98-a-0073 546.270625 553.086750 or or a mop anything you can put that on with anything whereas a lot of this other stuff you have to you have to actually sit down and paint it with a brush
sw2814A-ms98-a-0074 553.086750 558.264250 uh and or spray it but then you've got to worry about the over spray whereas this stuff is clear
sw2814A-ms98-a-0075 558.264250 563.790250 even if you got it on the side of some of your bricks or or on your concrete it wouldn't hurt anything
sw2814A-ms98-a-0076 563.790250 565.667000 you would never be able to know it so
sw2814A-ms98-a-0077 565.667000 570.676125 [silence]
sw2814A-ms98-a-0078 570.676125 580.283500 well it it's kind of fun though things like that especially something like that where where you're outside you're not worrying about something inside the house that you can mess up outside you can learn a lot by doing that
sw2814A-ms98-a-0079 580.283500 593.048625 [silence]
sw2814A-ms98-a-0080 593.048625 597.070750 well and it's and it could be cheaper in the long run and
sw2814A-ms98-a-0081 597.070750 599.415250 you know [vocalized-noise]
