sw2814B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.475500 [noise]
sw2814B-ms98-a-0002 0.475500 4.449750 [silence]
sw2814B-ms98-a-0003 4.449750 6.028625 well
sw2814B-ms98-a-0004 6.028625 19.350500 that's that's something um yeah we have it's a very timely subject i think in the Spring everybody decides that they're going to start over and do something with their house
sw2814B-ms98-a-0005 19.350500 32.072500 and we started last year an we have a little i guess it's a sixteen hundred foot house and it's just my husband and i here but um we decided that uh we wanted to build a sun room
sw2814B-ms98-a-0006 32.072500 44.562375 and um it's a good thing we got a contractor i mean this is not something you need to do by yourself so we ended up with a contractor and went through that whole {schmeal} with
sw2814B-ms98-a-0007 44.562375 58.025125 um the contractor saying one thing and then doing another and and uh anyway we ended up with uh a really neat sun room on the back of the house it's beautiful it's like two hundred square foot
sw2814B-ms98-a-0008 58.025125 69.846750 but that's not um something we did by ourselves if you talk about home repairs um Tom's real good at mowing the grass and doing the garden so [laughter-that's] [laughter-about] [laughter-it]
sw2814B-ms98-a-0009 69.846750 80.530250 [silence]
sw2814B-ms98-a-0010 80.530250 82.770375 isn't that amazing
sw2814B-ms98-a-0011 82.770375 84.543250 [silence]
sw2814B-ms98-a-0012 84.543250 86.564000 [laughter-yeah]
sw2814B-ms98-a-0013 86.564000 110.078000 [silence]
sw2814B-ms98-a-0014 110.078000 111.659250 yeah
sw2814B-ms98-a-0015 111.659250 122.874125 [silence]
sw2814B-ms98-a-0016 122.874125 133.823250 all those little details that you you don't really understand you know like we had some water leaks in the um well in the sun room there was a part that was fiberboard
sw2814B-ms98-a-0017 133.823250 143.655000 and you know tape and bed over that and when it did rain of course the [laughter-only] [laughter-way] to tell if this place leaks is to see if uh what happens after it rains
sw2814B-ms98-a-0018 143.655000 155.918750 and of course it leaked [laughter] um which is no big deal because they said they'd come fix it well that's true but you know fixing the tape and bedding to make it look nice again it's it's
sw2814B-ms98-a-0019 155.918750 162.056250 it's a chore and a half without tearing the whole thing out and repainting and doing everything again
sw2814B-ms98-a-0020 162.056250 164.767125 [silence]
sw2814B-ms98-a-0021 164.767125 166.233750 oh
sw2814B-ms98-a-0022 166.233750 168.275500 [silence]
sw2814B-ms98-a-0023 168.275500 169.748375 yeah
sw2814B-ms98-a-0024 169.748375 176.945000 [silence]
sw2814B-ms98-a-0025 176.945000 183.039375 i don't know i- i guess you get this idea that everything should be perfect and you know what this isn't a perfect world [laughter]
sw2814B-ms98-a-0026 183.039375 184.851625 it
sw2814B-ms98-a-0027 184.851625 186.344375 but you do
sw2814B-ms98-a-0028 186.344375 191.213625 [silence]
sw2814B-ms98-a-0029 191.213625 202.740375 oh i know because every time they send somebody out they have to take them off a crew that's making money doing a job and they have to send them back to you where they're not making any money trying to repair something that you know should have been right in the first place
sw2814B-ms98-a-0030 202.740375 203.918500 yeah
sw2814B-ms98-a-0031 203.918500 205.314625 [silence]
sw2814B-ms98-a-0032 205.314625 218.073375 well i was real happy with our contractor um actually i wasn't happy with the contractor i was happy with the job foreman so i think that made all the difference because_1 he was pretty um you know
sw2814B-ms98-a-0033 218.073375 229.792000 concerned about how it looked and and you know how it should be done the right way and he gave us a lot of clues you just wish you knew all this stuff going in that um
sw2814B-ms98-a-0034 229.792000 244.374125 it was funny because we didn't understand a lot of things that we had to do in addition to this you know like the tape and bedding and and doing finishing off this wall and that wall that wasn't in the contract you know kind of thing 
sw2814B-ms98-a-0035 244.374125 246.935625 so that was kind of interesting
sw2814B-ms98-a-0036 246.935625 248.557000 [silence]
sw2814B-ms98-a-0037 248.557000 250.405125 oh neat

sw2814B-ms98-a-0044 263.482750 275.849000 yeah well we've taken this another step further this year we're going to build a deck we've got some people building uh a deck out in the back you know to complete sort of the back yard kind of thing and um
sw2814B-ms98-a-0045 275.849000 279.137750 [silence]
sw2814B-ms98-a-0046 279.137750 280.544875 oh yeah

sw2814B-ms98-a-0064 338.755875 351.190000 that's that's what we're doing is just the redwood and we're doing it where they use the screws that are um [noise] they're not nails they're the screws have
sw2814B-ms98-a-0065 351.190000 364.450625 yeah those and so they're not going to split and and i was really concerned about bugs really when i when we were considering other types of wood because you know termites [laughter-can] [laughter-be] a real hazard around here
sw2814B-ms98-a-0066 364.450625 366.066000 [silence]

sw2814B-ms98-a-0075 414.291750 427.908875 it's so funny because Tom is getting more and more adept at doing things it's just things like painting just always used to really scare me he didn't know where to start um you know with a paint can you know an
