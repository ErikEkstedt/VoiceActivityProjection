sw2833B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 5.209625 [silence]
sw2833B-ms98-a-0002 5.209625 16.851000 w[ell]- well i['m]- i'm not really very much in favor of it at all uh i- i feel like uh th[e]- the government gets involved in in a little bit too much of our life anyway
sw2833B-ms98-a-0003 16.851000 23.519250 and health insurance is is one thing that i['m]- i'm not sure that they have the expertise to
sw2833B-ms98-a-0004 23.519250 29.947250 to run it anyway and i i just ki[nd]- i kind of feel like like i say we've got too much government already
sw2833B-ms98-a-0005 29.947250 41.925875 [silence]
sw2833B-ms98-a-0006 41.925875 43.407875 um-hum
sw2833B-ms98-a-0007 43.407875 44.667750 yeah
sw2833B-ms98-a-0008 44.667750 55.162750 [silence]
sw2833B-ms98-a-0009 55.162750 65.687875 yeah well i guess i- i- i- i guess m[y]- m[y]- my my own opinion of of uh government programs in general [vocalized-noise] especially those that
sw2833B-ms98-a-0010 65.687875 75.242625 are centralized type you know centralizing type of programs i have not seen one yet that that that i i felt like really worked the way it should
sw2833B-ms98-a-0011 75.242625 88.985375 i think that uh the private sector has uh a lot more expertise available and has the incentives to make a program work whereas a a bureaucracy
sw2833B-ms98-a-0012 88.985375 95.805500 uh people that work in in a bureaucracy are just there to keep the bureaucracy going
sw2833B-ms98-a-0013 95.805500 97.547250 so uh i'm
sw2833B-ms98-a-0014 97.547250 103.678125 [silence]
sw2833B-ms98-a-0015 103.678125 114.439000 yeah well i guess uh uh like i said i- i- i don't really know that much about it i i've uh uh mine may be more prejudice than opinion you know i- i guess i've got uh
sw2833B-ms98-a-0016 114.439000 118.648250 uh prejudice against the government y[ou]- you know uh
sw2833B-ms98-a-0017 118.648250 123.515625 i- i feel like i feel like too much government is too much government [laughter]
sw2833B-ms98-a-0018 123.515625 129.885250 [silence]
sw2833B-ms98-a-0019 129.885250 131.292125 yeah
sw2833B-ms98-a-0020 131.292125 142.188625 yeah i- i know that uh the British like i say i know i understand that the British system uh which is you know centralized medical program
sw2833B-ms98-a-0021 142.188625 147.858625 does not work very well or at least the people are not r[eal]- real happy with it
sw2833B-ms98-a-0022 147.858625 152.591500 a[nd]- and uh i i that's my understanding anyway
sw2833B-ms98-a-0023 152.591500 155.051375 and uh you know
sw2833B-ms98-a-0024 155.051375 157.400500 [silence]
sw2833B-ms98-a-0025 157.400500 158.655375 yeah
sw2833B-ms98-a-0026 158.655375 168.090500 yeah you know wh[en]- when you when you read uh uh uh see the some of the articles or or watch in particular watch some of the British made television shows
sw2833B-ms98-a-0027 168.090500 180.660375 you get the impression that it's it's more or less a joke uh you know a lot of people use it because they don't have an alternative uh an a[ffordable]- affordable alternative
sw2833B-ms98-a-0028 180.660375 191.310250 but they're you know they still it doesn't work very well i know i[n]- here in Texas i[n]- in the Dallas area we have a uh a county run hospital
sw2833B-ms98-a-0029 191.310250 199.618000 you know the county furnishes the hospital and people that don't have uh access to to insurance and stuff are able to go to that hospital
sw2833B-ms98-a-0030 199.618000 212.493125 but if you go there if you're you know if you've got an emergency you have to be almost dead before you can get in li[ke]- you know in a timely manner because there are so many people sitting there waiting all the time
sw2833B-ms98-a-0031 212.493125 219.315125 for medical services that you know if you may be there five or six hours you know for just normal treatment
sw2833B-ms98-a-0032 219.315125 231.303875 a[nd]- and [vocalized-noise] i guess i'm not uh i'm not too keen on having to go to a to a some kind of a location like that o[n]- on a routine basis
sw2833B-ms98-a-0033 231.303875 241.037250 [silence]
sw2833B-ms98-a-0034 241.037250 252.866000 well i guess uh to some extent uh an HMO i- i have been involved have have been a member of an HMO before for a short period of time and and that did work very well
sw2833B-ms98-a-0035 252.866000 266.820250 but it was you know the c[ompany]- it was a company sponsored plan a[nd]- and it it is you know individual doctors that do own or have a you know have a a shareholders in an HMO
sw2833B-ms98-a-0036 266.820250 279.172875 and uh so it's not [vocalized-noise] i- i guess uh it's not a it's not a government run operation and that's that's you know that's my main objection i you know i don't care how they finance it
sw2833B-ms98-a-0037 279.172875 291.910500 you know [vocalized-noise] they could they could put a tax on me and say this is for medical insurance and then hire a you know some kind of private company that's not run by a government
sw2833B-ms98-a-0038 291.910500 294.233000 to you know to run the program
sw2833B-ms98-a-0039 294.233000 297.308375 a[nd]- and that might work but
sw2833B-ms98-a-0040 297.308375 301.825750 [vocalized-noise] if it's if it's going to be run you know and supervised [vocalized-noise]
sw2833B-ms98-a-0041 301.825750 307.017250 a[t]- a[t]- at a government level by a bureaucratic type you know operation
sw2833B-ms98-a-0042 307.017250 310.451875 uh i don't think it's going to work myself
sw2833B-ms98-a-0043 310.451875 318.342125 i d[o]- i do think that we're headed that way i think that there's a strong possibility that i[n]- in my lifetime i will see
sw2833B-ms98-a-0044 318.342125 320.700500 uh you know [noise] see one
sw2833B-ms98-a-0045 320.700500 322.331250 in operation so
sw2833B-ms98-a-0046 322.331250 326.919375 [silence]
sw2833B-ms98-a-0047 326.919375 330.575500 well i think i think that uh i think there o[nly]-
sw2833B-ms98-a-0048 330.575500 332.585125 [noise] that want it uh
sw2833B-ms98-a-0049 332.585125 334.462375 and i think the government
sw2833B-ms98-a-0050 334.462375 338.319625 will respond you know to
sw2833B-ms98-a-0051 338.319625 346.344375 when i say a lot of people i'm not saying a majority of people but i think the government will respond to that group that does want it
sw2833B-ms98-a-0052 346.344375 347.950625 you know so
sw2833B-ms98-a-0053 347.950625 350.190500 you know you know i guess i i
sw2833B-ms98-a-0054 350.190500 354.634500 i'm a i'm a pessimist in that in that [laughter-respect]
sw2833B-ms98-a-0055 354.634500 356.564375 yeah yeah
sw2833B-ms98-a-0056 356.564375 364.168875 [silence]
sw2833B-ms98-a-0057 364.168875 369.998750 well i guess a[nd]- a[nd]- and and perhaps mine too you know perhaps i i need to know
sw2833B-ms98-a-0058 369.998750 376.707000 [noise] have stronger arguments for why are are or find out the the arguments in favor of you know so but uh
sw2833B-ms98-a-0059 376.707000 380.846750 but that's i guess that's [noise] i had not thought about before so
sw2833B-ms98-a-0060 380.846750 382.142250 [silence]
sw2833B-ms98-a-0061 382.142250 385.347250 yeah it was nice talking to you too okay thanks
sw2833B-ms98-a-0062 385.347250 386.703000 bye
