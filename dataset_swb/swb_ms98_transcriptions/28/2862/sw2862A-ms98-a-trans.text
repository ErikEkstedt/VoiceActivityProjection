sw2862A-ms98-a-0009 21.851500 27.497875 no i don't think so because_1 uh i saw just a little bit of the game today and he was out there playing
sw2862A-ms98-a-0010 27.497875 34.502250 although uh i what i saw was at the end of the first quarter i think he only had like [eightch/eight] eight points
sw2862A-ms98-a-0011 34.502250 38.044875 at the end of the first quarter they thought that was big news
sw2862A-ms98-a-0012 38.044875 46.565500 so i don't know but i don't know who won and uh i don't know who do you normally pull for the the Mavericks or

sw2862A-ms98-a-0018 90.715375 96.256375 now i uh i i've always been pulling for the Lakers for a long time
sw2862A-ms98-a-0019 96.256375 102.741000 and uh not just not just because they always win but uh when they had uh Akeem
sw2862A-ms98-a-0020 102.741000 106.620500 anybody who was old as that playing that well
sw2862A-ms98-a-0021 106.620500 112.488875 you know i just kind of had to go with them then i kind of got caught up with a lot of the other players
sw2862A-ms98-a-0022 112.488875 123.165375 and uh course uh all the people that follow the Lakers and everything out there in in California um and it also helps when they were winning [laughter]
sw2862A-ms98-a-0023 123.165375 126.287375 [silence]
sw2862A-ms98-a-0024 126.287375 133.548625 i was i always wondered that you know i i will take a look at the individual score you know in the individual stance in the NBA
sw2862A-ms98-a-0025 133.548625 138.743125 and you know they they have in the paper you know like fifteen different categories
sw2862A-ms98-a-0026 138.743125 149.693375 and they'll have like a individuals uh they'll have the the highest scorer the top rebounders uh assists foul shooting percentages and all that
sw2862A-ms98-a-0027 149.693375 161.844125 and you go [thown/down] through and virtually every one of the categories there isn't uh a Laker in the top ten usually hardly a[ny]- uh any[body]- anybody in the top twenty except for like Magic
sw2862A-ms98-a-0028 161.844125 173.288375 and uh yet the Lakers continue to win so you're right i think they do really play much better as a team than they do uh uh each one you know individually at their spot
sw2862A-ms98-a-0029 173.288375 176.014250 [silence]
