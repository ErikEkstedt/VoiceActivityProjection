sw2822A-ms98-a-0002 0.722125 10.402875 you know it's uh i'm a CPA so i use computer quite a bit uh i'm not sure why they call them sometimes call them personal computers uh

sw2822A-ms98-a-0004 11.994125 17.726625 yeah righ[t]- well ye[ah]- actual i think they mean one that's that is uh
sw2822A-ms98-a-0005 17.726625 26.612250 designed or designated dedicated for one person to use primarily as opposed to uh large mainframe computer
sw2822A-ms98-a-0006 26.612250 26.873500 [noise]
sw2822A-ms98-a-0007 26.873500 32.316125 which you know several people maybe use uh terminals tied to it
sw2822A-ms98-a-0008 32.316125 35.859000 i guess that's that's my definition anyway
sw2822A-ms98-a-0009 35.859000 43.135750 right um i have an IBM it's uh one they call the XT
sw2822A-ms98-a-0010 43.135750 46.065875 which is one of the earlier models
sw2822A-ms98-a-0011 46.065875 51.621625 Prior to that i had uh one that was a Heath Kit computer which is one that i
sw2822A-ms98-a-0012 51.621625 54.312750 basically built myself
sw2822A-ms98-a-0013 54.312750 62.537125 uh yeah and uh so i've had uh i've had a computer for uh oh about ten years little over ten years i guess now
sw2822A-ms98-a-0014 62.537125 63.988000 [silence]
sw2822A-ms98-a-0015 63.988000 71.467375 well you uh Heath Kit which is uh you know one of these uh electronic stores it's a hobby store place
sw2822A-ms98-a-0016 71.467375 79.203875 and you can go there and buy a kit or at least you use to be able to i'm not sure that you can still buy those from them now
sw2822A-ms98-a-0017 79.203875 86.071875 but you could buy a kit and build a computer it like have a would have a manual step-by-step manual
sw2822A-ms98-a-0018 86.071875 88.695625 to go through and put all the parts together
sw2822A-ms98-a-0019 88.695625 90.181000 [silence]
sw2822A-ms98-a-0020 90.181000 99.827875 uh yeah it uh it then it was and of course the computer are so cheap now i'm not even sure how it would how it would compare uh
sw2822A-ms98-a-0021 99.827875 107.649375 back then the computer that i built was uh one you know was a old pretty low level technology wise
sw2822A-ms98-a-0022 107.649375 112.955000 and uh it cost me oh fifteen hundred dollars i guess to build it
sw2822A-ms98-a-0023 112.955000 121.018125 and it would have cost eighteen hundred or so to buy i think so it was you know it was not a great saving but it was a learning experience any way
sw2822A-ms98-a-0024 121.018125 122.511000 [silence]
sw2822A-ms98-a-0025 122.511000 123.756375 yeah

sw2822A-ms98-a-0027 124.875500 133.001250 yeah if uh if he's [vocalized-noise] if he's aware of building you know building electronic stuff he's he knows about Heath Kit probably
sw2822A-ms98-a-0028 133.001250 134.457000 [silence]
sw2822A-ms98-a-0029 134.457000 136.143875 not into electron[ic]-

sw2822A-ms98-a-0033 139.616125 145.523500 but uh you know i had to had to learn a little bit about uh using a solder iron and and that kind of stuff
sw2822A-ms98-a-0034 145.523500 154.882625 well i i say uh i said basically i built it myself when i got to a certain point i took it to a TI engineer that uh was a friend of my wife's and
sw2822A-ms98-a-0035 154.882625 161.302625 he uh you know he worked with help me finished putting it together you know and make it work right it uh
sw2822A-ms98-a-0036 161.302625 173.314750 so you know if you don't know much electronics you can you know you have to have somebody with a little electronic background to make it work but uh you know the basic stuff i i did all the basics any way
sw2822A-ms98-a-0037 173.314750 175.843625 [silence]
sw2822A-ms98-a-0038 175.843625 186.511750 no well i use mine at work i don't i don't even have one at the house any more it's uh i've got it in my office and uh matter fact i'm in the market for another one
sw2822A-ms98-a-0039 186.511750 187.630375 [silence]
sw2822A-ms98-a-0040 187.630375 191.636250 no for my home you know so i mean for my for my office
sw2822A-ms98-a-0041 191.636250 197.382500 so i'm i'm not sure [vocalized-noise] eventually i'll have to i'll probably have one at home too but uh
sw2822A-ms98-a-0042 197.382500 204.928125 [silence]
sw2822A-ms98-a-0043 204.928125 206.998500 oh yeah oh
sw2822A-ms98-a-0044 206.998500 214.412500 well you can have them connected by a by a modem if you want to which is a telephone line
sw2822A-ms98-a-0045 214.412500 219.511000 but but you can can have the same software you know the same programs
sw2822A-ms98-a-0046 219.511000 227.139125 so that you just take your data files from one to the other so that you can use the same computer you know for the for the
sw2822A-ms98-a-0047 227.139125 231.342250 a a different computers for the same project
sw2822A-ms98-a-0048 231.342250 240.082000 so you know it's and that's that's one thing that i would like to have uh occasionally i need to work at home you know and now i don't have a computer there so
sw2822A-ms98-a-0049 240.082000 241.256375 [silence]
sw2822A-ms98-a-0050 241.256375 245.323000 you know that's i could if i you know if i if i had a computer there so
sw2822A-ms98-a-0051 245.323000 248.963750 [silence]
sw2822A-ms98-a-0052 248.963750 250.604250 um-hum
sw2822A-ms98-a-0053 250.604250 251.883000 [silence]
sw2822A-ms98-a-0054 251.883000 252.755125 yeah

sw2822A-ms98-a-0056 258.803250 260.066750 yeah so
sw2822A-ms98-a-0057 260.066750 261.326750 but uh
sw2822A-ms98-a-0058 261.326750 269.943375 you know it's uh you know the computer's it's uh the you know [vocalized-noise] growing thing in uh you know [vocalized-noise] both home and business i i think eventually
sw2822A-ms98-a-0059 269.943375 272.521375 [silence]
sw2822A-ms98-a-0060 272.521375 282.051875 yeah that's but eventually [vocalized-noise] i think uh most homes will have a computer you know [vocalized-noise] for for some reason uh either the
sw2822A-ms98-a-0061 282.051875 287.285500 [silence]
sw2822A-ms98-a-0062 287.285500 289.274375 right yeah
sw2822A-ms98-a-0063 289.274375 292.640250 yeah new cars have computer in them and
sw2822A-ms98-a-0064 292.640250 297.167875 [silence]
sw2822A-ms98-a-0065 297.167875 301.655875 uh no i haven't seen that but i have heard about it but i haven't seen it
sw2822A-ms98-a-0066 301.655875 304.345750 yeah but uh
sw2822A-ms98-a-0067 304.345750 316.268750 i don't know i guess the uh the personal computer is it's really uh going to be a necessity that you know children should learn to use it i was just commenting i teach uh a couple accounting classes
sw2822A-ms98-a-0068 316.268750 320.789000 and uh i was just commenting the other night that it's uh
sw2822A-ms98-a-0069 320.789000 332.992125 going to reach the point where um accounting classes in college have to have computer for the students to use you know in every class uh right now i teach over at Brookhaven College
sw2822A-ms98-a-0070 332.992125 341.418375 and there's only one class that i happen to teach that that teaches the accounting students anything about using the computer
sw2822A-ms98-a-0071 341.418375 347.392500 if they want to use want to learn the computer they have to take classes outside of the accounting area
sw2822A-ms98-a-0072 347.392500 349.984625 [silence]
sw2822A-ms98-a-0073 349.984625 351.506250 uh-huh
sw2822A-ms98-a-0074 351.506250 357.110625 [silence]
sw2822A-ms98-a-0075 357.110625 369.543250 yeah and uh but yeah it's that's something that's going to be uh a necessity for accountants because you you know it's you can do so much for more work with a computer then you can do you know doing it manually
sw2822A-ms98-a-0076 369.543250 373.011625 and uh and a lot more accurately also
sw2822A-ms98-a-0077 373.011625 383.634625 i use the computer to do you know all of my accounting work and of course i write letters on the computer and i do income tax on the [laughter-computer] so it's i use it a lot
sw2822A-ms98-a-0078 383.634625 387.004375 [silence]
sw2822A-ms98-a-0079 387.004375 389.450125 yeah you know it's just it would be
sw2822A-ms98-a-0080 389.450125 399.190750 if uh if you have a computer you can buy you know some little cheap software that uh that uh you can buy like at Software House here in Richard in uh Dallas at uh over in Addison
sw2822A-ms98-a-0081 399.190750 403.814250 you can go over there and buy an income tax package that will run on a personal computer
sw2822A-ms98-a-0082 403.814250 416.868625 and do your income tax and it's one of those where you can change things you know to see what happens you know you say well let's see i've got some many uh so much of my charitable contributions on my itemized deductions
sw2822A-ms98-a-0083 416.868625 422.389250 and then you discover that you had more then you thought you did you can go back in and change it
sw2822A-ms98-a-0084 422.389250 429.252125 and it changes everything on the return and you don't have to go back and you know change every line with you know the eraser or the
sw2822A-ms98-a-0085 429.252125 431.653375 the uh liquid paper or whatever
sw2822A-ms98-a-0086 431.653375 432.727750 [silence]
sw2822A-ms98-a-0087 432.727750 440.299750 so it's it's really convenient to have that plus you know you've got it on the computer and it does all the calculations and the math and
sw2822A-ms98-a-0088 440.299750 444.691625 you know makes for a lot of your errors on the return
sw2822A-ms98-a-0089 444.691625 446.466875 yeah so
sw2822A-ms98-a-0090 446.466875 448.452125 [silence]
sw2822A-ms98-a-0091 448.452125 450.099875 uh-huh
sw2822A-ms98-a-0092 450.099875 452.960500 right but uh

sw2822A-ms98-a-0098 472.792875 479.737250 yeah they uh they start are starting real early on the computers when he gets to school he will probably be using a computer
sw2822A-ms98-a-0099 479.737250 483.862750 you know yeah second or third grade probably and uh
sw2822A-ms98-a-0100 483.862750 489.189375 he'll he'll know more about computer then you will and you'll be having to go back to school just too keep up with him
sw2822A-ms98-a-0101 489.189375 490.333375 [laughter]
sw2822A-ms98-a-0102 490.333375 491.935875 [silence]
sw2822A-ms98-a-0103 491.935875 499.664250 yeah that's you have to have to learn have to learn a little bit as they go along you you suddenly discover that your educated [laughter-when] the students are 
sw2822A-ms98-a-0104 499.664250 502.005375 [silence]
sw2822A-ms98-a-0105 502.005375 503.489375 well
sw2822A-ms98-a-0106 503.489375 513.457875 well it's been a it's been interesting taking uh about computers it's uh that's one of my favorite subjects and uh i really i get into talking about them_1 so

sw2822A-ms98-a-0111 534.643125 536.009000 [silence]
sw2822A-ms98-a-0112 536.009000 543.923625 yeah yeah so it's been been nice talking to you and uh guess uh m[aybe]- maybe they'll ring us up again sometime
