sw2800A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 13.035875 i don't guess we got our first uh credit card oh back in the seventies early seventies uh when i first got married was a Visa card uh issued out of a Liberty Bank in Oklahoma City because my
sw2800A-ms98-a-0002 13.035875 14.537375 sister worked at the uh
sw2800A-ms98-a-0003 14.537375 17.639625 uh the Visa [vocalized-noise] Bank Americard
sw2800A-ms98-a-0004 17.639625 24.631125 center there so we were still in college and had she not worked there i'm not sure that i would have qualified
sw2800A-ms98-a-0005 24.631125 27.224625 they've come in handy over the years
sw2800A-ms98-a-0006 27.224625 29.797375 uh and they have become or
sw2800A-ms98-a-0007 29.797375 31.553750 also a
sw2800A-ms98-a-0008 31.553750 34.086750 a real bother sometimes
sw2800A-ms98-a-0009 34.086750 41.119125 especially you know if you catch yourself short on cash or if you're on vacation it's just easier to put everything on a card
sw2800A-ms98-a-0010 41.119125 46.674250 and uh i find if you're not careful you wind up uh a month or so
sw2800A-ms98-a-0011 46.674250 51.398125 staring those bills in the face and you go i don't remember doing all that stuff and it adds up
sw2800A-ms98-a-0012 51.398125 53.443500 [silence]
sw2800A-ms98-a-0013 53.443500 59.317250 so sometimes uh especially traveling with TI you know everything goes on American Express
sw2800A-ms98-a-0014 59.317250 62.275250 and it makes it a whole lot easier for bookkeeping
sw2800A-ms98-a-0015 62.275250 69.216375 but uh as far as personal life goes i guess i really try to use them as little as possible uh
sw2800A-ms98-a-0016 69.216375 74.593750 i kind of like having them for uh gasoline purchases
sw2800A-ms98-a-0017 74.593750 77.432750 [silence]
sw2800A-ms98-a-0018 77.432750 78.550000 yeah
sw2800A-ms98-a-0019 78.550000 91.049000 but other than that uh i i guess over the years tried to avoid the national credit card syndrome of just putting everything on there day after day after day and then then you really get socked to it if you don't watch it
sw2800A-ms98-a-0020 91.049000 92.386625 [silence]
sw2800A-ms98-a-0021 92.386625 94.105125 how how do you
sw2800A-ms98-a-0022 94.105125 95.861125 look at cre[dit]- credit cards
sw2800A-ms98-a-0023 95.861125 98.578750 [silence]
sw2800A-ms98-a-0024 98.578750 99.788125 [vocalized-noise] that's
sw2800A-ms98-a-0025 99.788125 109.024625 [silence]
sw2800A-ms98-a-0026 109.024625 110.188125 right
sw2800A-ms98-a-0027 110.188125 112.444125 [silence]
sw2800A-ms98-a-0028 112.444125 118.159375 well that's kind of the way we were coming it's it's uh i guess for that very reason that that uh
sw2800A-ms98-a-0029 118.159375 120.672625 if you're not real conscious of what you're doing
sw2800A-ms98-a-0030 120.672625 121.691125 [noise]
sw2800A-ms98-a-0031 121.691125 130.197500 it's just too much by the time you get well if you got a bunch of cards you get a bunch of bills every month and for some strange reason those people think they need to get paid
sw2800A-ms98-a-0032 130.197500 131.532625 [silence]
sw2800A-ms98-a-0033 131.532625 132.729125 yeah
sw2800A-ms98-a-0034 132.729125 142.165750 and i give them maybe not maybe they're not really concerned about getting paid because they're know if you don't then they're adding on what eighteen nineteen twenty percent sometimes it's twenty two percent interest
sw2800A-ms98-a-0035 142.165750 143.603375 [silence]
sw2800A-ms98-a-0036 143.603375 144.827125 yeah
sw2800A-ms98-a-0037 144.827125 145.657375 [silence]
sw2800A-ms98-a-0038 145.657375 149.264500 i guess that's one of the motivations behind the the uh
sw2800A-ms98-a-0039 149.264500 156.346250 [vocalized-noise] the uh American Express card with TI there's no with the American Express card from TI there's no um 
sw2800A-ms98-a-0040 156.346250 162.331500 late fee there's no uh interest rate you ei[ther]- you either pay the thing off or they come get it
sw2800A-ms98-a-0041 162.331500 165.380875 and it's turned into personnel and they come get you
sw2800A-ms98-a-0042 165.380875 166.010250 [noise]
sw2800A-ms98-a-0043 166.010250 169.225625 so they've got quite a bit more motivation i think to get paid then
sw2800A-ms98-a-0044 169.225625 170.968375 then some of the others do
sw2800A-ms98-a-0045 170.968375 173.958250 but that's the one that your cost center manager sees every month
sw2800A-ms98-a-0046 173.958250 174.865500 so you're
sw2800A-ms98-a-0047 174.865500 179.058375 a little bit more careful about what you put on that even though you can use it however you want to
sw2800A-ms98-a-0048 179.058375 180.364625 [silence]
sw2800A-ms98-a-0049 180.364625 181.438375 oh yeah
sw2800A-ms98-a-0050 181.438375 183.354375 you can use it like any other card
sw2800A-ms98-a-0051 183.354375 184.717125 and uh
sw2800A-ms98-a-0052 184.717125 191.462125 but it you know you kind of you know that somebody every month and who knows how many people are looking at those uh
sw2800A-ms98-a-0053 191.462125 195.170375 bills that come in and those statements you're not the only one
sw2800A-ms98-a-0054 195.170375 196.415625 so
sw2800A-ms98-a-0055 196.415625 199.312500 y[ou]- uh you want to make sure that [vocalized-noise]
sw2800A-ms98-a-0056 199.312500 205.031125 uh is that okay is that o[kay]- okay that -[o]kay those people see what it is that you are buying and most of the time it is 
sw2800A-ms98-a-0057 205.031125 206.091000 [silence]
sw2800A-ms98-a-0058 206.091000 217.288000 but most of the others i've sent back i mean all you get is card offers i've got three card offers now uh from gas companies and uh Visa Gold and
sw2800A-ms98-a-0059 217.288000 221.316750 uh some other bank uh Citibank i think is always sending the Visa stuff out
sw2800A-ms98-a-0060 221.316750 224.306625 and i usually just throw them away because i you know
sw2800A-ms98-a-0061 224.306625 225.529250 [silence]
sw2800A-ms98-a-0062 225.529250 229.618000 i don't want another one i don't want to have to mess with it you know you carry around a wallet full of
sw2800A-ms98-a-0063 229.618000 232.018125 credit cards and uh
sw2800A-ms98-a-0064 232.018125 234.522000 one of these days it's going to all be full
sw2800A-ms98-a-0065 234.522000 243.550250 [silence]
sw2800A-ms98-a-0066 243.550250 245.281250 oh that's not bad
sw2800A-ms98-a-0067 245.281250 246.425250 [silence]
sw2800A-ms98-a-0068 246.425250 251.318000 yeah no if they don't say no annual membership on them i'll throw them away um
sw2800A-ms98-a-0069 251.318000 256.230875 years ago well th[at]- i had my Visa card through this bank in Oklahoma City for
sw2800A-ms98-a-0070 256.230875 261.407625 oh probably fifteen years and then they started charging uh annual membership fees
sw2800A-ms98-a-0071 261.407625 264.972625 and i said adios i'm you know i'm not paying you
sw2800A-ms98-a-0072 264.972625 269.409375 it's just another way to make money as far as i can tell i mean they've been
sw2800A-ms98-a-0073 269.409375 271.107375 well sure
sw2800A-ms98-a-0074 271.107375 276.664625 and they i guess they figure they've got enough people out there with cards they're going to get cards at uh twenty bucks a pop
sw2800A-ms98-a-0075 276.664625 278.657500 there's going to be that much more
sw2800A-ms98-a-0076 278.657500 290.981625 uh so then a couple years ago i found uh a bank here in Plano that if you kept a minimum balance in any kind of account whether it was a savings account or what it was you can get a Visa card through them and no annual membership
sw2800A-ms98-a-0077 290.981625 296.274875 so i went over and just stuck three hundred dollars in my son's savings account in his name and
sw2800A-ms98-a-0078 296.274875 305.535500 got my Visa card so as long as they have no annual membership fee i it would be okay but i can't see paying someone to use their card be charged that eighteen percent interests
sw2800A-ms98-a-0079 305.535500 311.745875 so yeah i think you're right the best philosophy is have them if you need them but otherwise leave them tucked away somewhere
sw2800A-ms98-a-0080 311.745875 313.316250 yeah
sw2800A-ms98-a-0081 313.316250 315.134625 [silence]
sw2800A-ms98-a-0082 315.134625 318.596125 yeah it sure does maybe they're counting on that i don't know
sw2800A-ms98-a-0083 318.596125 321.973875 well i guess that's it thanks for talking
sw2800A-ms98-a-0084 321.973875 323.012750 bye
sw2800A-ms98-a-0085 323.012750 325.351625 [noise]
