sw2899A-ms98-a-0030 120.549625 128.476625 [silence]
sw2899A-ms98-a-0031 128.476625 131.878875 yeah did either of your parents go to college
sw2899A-ms98-a-0032 131.878875 139.046000 yeah neither did mine so i wasn't really didn't know what to expect so uh
sw2899A-ms98-a-0033 139.046000 142.216875 yeah it sounds like uh
sw2899A-ms98-a-0034 142.216875 149.897625 like you said sometimes the the name colleges the the large major universities carry the big name and uh
sw2899A-ms98-a-0035 149.897625 156.417750 if they're private you know like a Harvard or something they're big bucks sometimes fortunately though uh some of the big name schools are in state
sw2899A-ms98-a-0036 156.417750 168.601375 and they're state universities like uh Michigan or you know Purdue or something like that and you can get uh a good education at a good cost you know if if you're in state
sw2899A-ms98-a-0037 168.601375 176.180125 but if you know if your kids are ou[t]- uh uh they want to go to college out of state you know you have to look like you said is the
sw2899A-ms98-a-0038 176.180125 185.028250 are y[ou]- are they going to get the education that's going to balance out like here in Sherman there's Austin College and i'm from up north i never heard of Austin College
sw2899A-ms98-a-0039 185.028250 192.776250 but it's well respected in this area it's private it's very expensive and just talking to people that go there it is uh
sw2899A-ms98-a-0040 192.776250 202.168875 you know y[ou]- you know the professors on a first name basis you go over their house quite often and eat and spend time with them and at the major universities you just don't do that
sw2899A-ms98-a-0041 202.168875 207.405250 you know there's thirty thousand people there and there's couple hundred people in each of your class and
sw2899A-ms98-a-0042 207.405250 219.424500 and i remember one professor wanted to have people over but people were you know just kind of scared to go over and are they going to be called brownnoser when uh so it's just sort of unaccepted you just kind of
sw2899A-ms98-a-0043 219.424500 224.360750 go to class and you don't usually use the office hours i mean there's not the
sw2899A-ms98-a-0044 224.360750 232.512875 the relationship you get the degree with the big name on it but you know you don't build that there's a lot of learning that you don't get
sw2899A-ms98-a-0045 232.512875 240.661875 as opposed to that's what i like about Austin College i didn't know that because i'd never been around any small colleges but uh
sw2899A-ms98-a-0046 240.661875 245.340875 but there again like you said the big name the big bucks you know you can go anywhere with a
sw2899A-ms98-a-0047 245.340875 258.141875 a degree from Stanford you know and people turn heads but you know a degree from Austin College or something you know where's that well you know it's not really well known and unfortunately sometimes that has to do with their sports program you know
sw2899A-ms98-a-0048 258.141875 272.095125 if uh you know well some schools maybe not like U N L V you know people kind of think that's a joke you know and you know it's big name and everybody knows about it and everybody wears U N L V shirts but you know what kind of education are these people getting but
sw2899A-ms98-a-0049 272.095125 281.580750 you know some of the other schools like uh you know North Carolina and Duke you know while they're successful in like basketball i mean people know that they're really good in academics
sw2899A-ms98-a-0050 281.580750 295.624875 [silence]
sw2899A-ms98-a-0051 295.624875 306.397125 yeah yeah i've never been to school down here so i really don't know uh i guess there again i mean there's the good and the bad like um
sw2899A-ms98-a-0052 306.397125 312.509750 there seem to be a lot of junior colleges and community colleges down here and up north there aren't
sw2899A-ms98-a-0053 312.509750 322.195375 i mean pretty much you either go to a technical school out of if you go to further schooling you go to like a technical school like a DeVry or something like that
sw2899A-ms98-a-0054 322.195375 329.732500 or you go to a university or a major college there are [laughter] there as far as i know there are very few
