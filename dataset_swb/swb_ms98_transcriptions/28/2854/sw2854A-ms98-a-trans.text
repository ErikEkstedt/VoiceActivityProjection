sw2854A-ms98-a-0023 75.305500 86.139625 i right and and so that but i was working full-time uh when he was born but i was very lucky because i was a a college professor
sw2854A-ms98-a-0024 86.139625 95.954875 and so i was able to you know and i it was walking distance from m[y]- from my apartment so i went up there and i sort of left him with with a neighbor
sw2854A-ms98-a-0025 95.954875 102.039625 and i left him in a carry cot when he was very little and i said you know he doesn't need anything except you know
sw2854A-ms98-a-0026 102.039625 109.537500 l[ook]- look at him if he cries but you know don't pick him up and and this sort of stuff because_1 i was gone only an hour at a stretch or an hour and a half
sw2854A-ms98-a-0027 109.537500 115.265875 and i was able to you know get h[is]- his schedule just uh cooperated and

sw2854A-ms98-a-0038 154.764250 167.747000 i'm in Maryland but but i was out of the country when um my my son was little but but the thing is if you have this flextime and that you might be able to do something similar to what i did which is
sw2854A-ms98-a-0039 167.747000 178.730750 you know be there short times and then later on when he was you know i mean this we're talking about uh i went back to work and or taught some some classes like a week after he was born
sw2854A-ms98-a-0040 178.730750 180.050750 and so
sw2854A-ms98-a-0041 180.050750 187.397625 yeah and so that's when i was saying you know don't don't pick him up and stuff but then later what i did was i brought a woman into the house
sw2854A-ms98-a-0042 187.397625 193.070125 and she w[as]- she was supposed to help me a little bit with cooking and doing the baby's laundry and this sort of stuff
sw2854A-ms98-a-0043 193.070125 197.015125 and then i also came home and sort of w[as]-
sw2854A-ms98-a-0044 197.015125 209.408625 was able to see from a distance what she was doing and you know in a sense she she carried him around a lot too much uh you know for for my taste it was constantly no i don't want him to explore anything he might
sw2854A-ms98-a-0045 209.408625 212.422125 uh he might hurt [laughter-himself]

sw2854A-ms98-a-0049 224.317750 229.572375 i think it worked out very w[ell]- a very well because what he learned to do by the time he was 
sw2854A-ms98-a-0050 229.572375 242.594500 two or so he would sit next to the desk where i was grading papers or writing lesson plans and he had asked for a paper and you know sort of scribble and then he realized that there were quiet times and there were active times
sw2854A-ms98-a-0051 242.594500 254.368250 [silence]
sw2854A-ms98-a-0052 254.368250 255.622500 oh

sw2854A-ms98-a-0067 310.758375 316.402125 oh i [laughter] in my opinion it's even then i mean uh kids need you
sw2854A-ms98-a-0068 316.402125 320.914375 [silence]
sw2854A-ms98-a-0069 320.914375 322.862250 no i was in the Middle East

sw2854A-ms98-a-0074 340.346750 346.026000 no i was just going to say i guess uh my sensitivities are are much more with the
sw2854A-ms98-a-0075 346.026000 353.199375 you know to be at home because actually i had my grandmother with me from the time she was from the time she was ninety two until she died at ninety seven
sw2854A-ms98-a-0076 353.199375 366.119625 and i mean that was recently after my [laughter-son] [laughter-son] was going off and i mean yes in a sense i went to work and she was at home alone some of the time but but still you know it was much better than being shipped
sw2854A-ms98-a-0077 366.119625 368.148375 to a day care center
sw2854A-ms98-a-0078 368.148375 382.005000 you know which is much my [laughter-feelings] on kids and the elderly i think we're t[oo]- we're too too much towards it's somebody else's problem you know i want to work shove them_1 in in some school for twelve hours a day
sw2854A-ms98-a-0079 382.005000 383.744375 [silence]
sw2854A-ms98-a-0080 383.744375 384.757250 yeah

sw2854A-ms98-a-0090 432.628750 444.706125 yeah no i i think that certainly there is a role uh for this type of help and and as long as one can can supervise it and and you know make it work
sw2854A-ms98-a-0091 444.706125 454.539000 in[to]- into one's own schedule without it seeming like dumping or or uh giving it you know the whole job to somebody else to take care of
sw2854A-ms98-a-0092 454.539000 455.661000 a[nd]-

sw2854A-ms98-a-0099 477.953000 485.965125 actually there seems to be an alternative in my neighborhood is there seem there are several uh uh m[others]- mothers who stay home
sw2854A-ms98-a-0100 485.965125 493.100750 and they take you know it's probably not completely legal uh i maybe it's legal up to one or two additional kids
sw2854A-ms98-a-0101 493.100750 503.729000 but and they they take care of another child and i i can actually n[ame]- could name five or six people around my neighborhood that really do a good job on this
sw2854A-ms98-a-0102 503.729000 512.907875 and i mean that's another possibility and you know you might want to stay home one year and some other lady might want to stay home for a a few years and
sw2854A-ms98-a-0103 512.907875 518.530250 [silence]
sw2854A-ms98-a-0104 518.530250 520.094625 yeah yeah

sw2854A-ms98-a-0106 532.098000 540.971375 no well actually there was a day care center um where my son did go for a year i think from when he was two to three
sw2854A-ms98-a-0107 540.971375 544.950250 but then he actually started kindergarten at age three
sw2854A-ms98-a-0108 544.950250 549.688125 and so and i[t]- you know it wasn't like pre kindergarten it was real kindergarten
sw2854A-ms98-a-0109 549.688125 553.544750 yeah so he w[as]- he was ready to to go to school at that point
sw2854A-ms98-a-0110 553.544750 560.388875 but yeah they're they do have such facilities but for the most part uh the with the extended family
sw2854A-ms98-a-0111 560.388875 571.558625 you know you can usually find somebody which is much like our neighbor you know to sharing responsibility and i'm and also there aren't that many women who who d[o]- who work
sw2854A-ms98-a-0112 571.558625 572.838875 yeah
sw2854A-ms98-a-0113 572.838875 577.020000 [silence]

sw2854A-ms98-a-0117 584.611250 590.361125 no no and i didn't mean Israel so you you assumed right [laughter]
sw2854A-ms98-a-0118 590.361125 600.870500 well no because at first thought uh when i s[aid]- uh you know i said that not many people work i'm i'm thinking oh well she's going to you know because certainly in Israel the women do [laughter-work]
