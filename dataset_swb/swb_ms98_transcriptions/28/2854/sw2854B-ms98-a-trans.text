sw2854B-ms98-a-0003 6.982125 12.959750 opinions just what i know out of my peer group uh has gone through and none of it's been [laughter-good]
sw2854B-ms98-a-0004 12.959750 14.297875 yeah
sw2854B-ms98-a-0005 14.297875 18.764375 uh the ones that can afford to have live in nannies they seem to be having an okay time
sw2854B-ms98-a-0006 18.764375 26.270750 uh but a lot of the other ones that ha[ve]- are professional um i'd say fifty percent of you know my peers that i'm in my circle of friends
sw2854B-ms98-a-0007 26.270750 31.689375 have tried it and then stopped working until they're you know going to get their children in kindergarten or first grade
sw2854B-ms98-a-0008 31.689375 37.284250 uh but i there must be some good service out there if you really look and pay for it

sw2854B-ms98-a-0015 54.241250 59.333125 so a[nd]- and actually the question is uh very appropriate because_1 i'm not sure whether um
sw2854B-ms98-a-0016 59.333125 65.130375 how strong the maternal instinct's going to be they tell me it's going to be [laughter-strong] do you have children
sw2854B-ms98-a-0017 65.130375 69.563625 and did you put him in day care or is he older now or younger or

sw2854B-ms98-a-0036 125.595250 134.809125 so what we're hoping is that um i mean my husband thinks i can do it i've just never worked out of a domestic base you know i've always been in a corporate uh environment
sw2854B-ms98-a-0037 134.809125 141.951875 um but i'm hoping that possibly i can do something where i can go flextime or part-time or if they don't have that um
sw2854B-ms98-a-0038 141.951875 150.436500 my boss i'm very lucky though again too my boss is very akin to family building so i think that's some[thing]- th[at]- something that couples need in going into this
sw2854B-ms98-a-0039 150.436500 155.671250 um i don't know i do think there's good day care out there what part of the country are you in

sw2854B-ms98-a-0068 254.667250 258.312375 and that's um just
sw2854B-ms98-a-0069 258.312375 260.298125 R[omania]- Romania
sw2854B-ms98-a-0070 260.298125 265.986500 as in like what 20/20 and um but we we're real excited because we've just developed a contact
sw2854B-ms98-a-0071 265.986500 272.167625 through professional people and it's private and it's hospital it's we're just very [laughter-excited] um

sw2854B-ms98-a-0073 273.632375 284.382000 i[t]- i[t]- what's the word i'm looking for when you deal with issues like that um in terms of family building through adoption um and then you have people responding to you well if you go through that why would you put them in day care
sw2854B-ms98-a-0074 284.382000 288.822375 um issues are being raised prematurely in my mind but i guess they're not because
sw2854B-ms98-a-0075 288.822375 300.990875 it's something i'll have to deal with sooner than later um and i what i've learned to do is just tune out everybody's opinion i feel that if the child's healthy um you know as long as we make it feel secure i'd love to do something like with what you did
sw2854B-ms98-a-0076 300.990875 307.620000 um i don't think i could be a dumper where i could take it from you know eight in the morning till nine at night or six at night and leave it there
sw2854B-ms98-a-0077 307.620000 311.941500 uh maybe after two or three or [vocalized-noise] years old i don't know um

sw2854B-ms98-a-0081 316.081750 322.414875 well they need a schedule i think i don't think the United States what country were you um in Europe when you were uh uh
sw2854B-ms98-a-0082 322.414875 327.565500 um oh that's [laughter-sort] [laughter-of] well that's the same thing i mean i don't know how they are there but uh
sw2854B-ms98-a-0083 327.565500 335.954500 in eastern Europe my stepfather's from England it just seems the United States does not provide for either child care or geria[trics]- or elder care as i call it
sw2854B-ms98-a-0084 335.954500 339.600500 um and we're just not set up for that um with the

sw2854B-ms98-a-0098 381.256750 388.273500 right it's easier and i agree with that that's why i y[ou]- you know what is amazing to me is now your son is already grown but you can probably empathize with this
sw2854B-ms98-a-0099 388.273500 392.190250 it's amazing to me how forthcoming people are with their opinions and thoughts [laughter]
sw2854B-ms98-a-0100 392.190250 395.038125 in terms of what to do um
sw2854B-ms98-a-0101 395.038125 401.763750 and i just don't think there is a day a good day care system um my company i'm particularly fortunate that they have they're in tune with that
sw2854B-ms98-a-0102 401.763750 411.695500 but i've been at companies where um you know the deci[sion]- the the trend is or the definite mood is well we made conscious decisions not to have children
sw2854B-ms98-a-0103 411.695500 418.423500 you know and in and a couple like us building through adoption there it's almost radical to some people
sw2854B-ms98-a-0104 418.423500 425.825500 and what you just learn to do is tune everybody else out and um and i respect there are some women that i know that are divorced or on their own or
sw2854B-ms98-a-0105 425.825500 430.146000 in single parenting and men that they you know they may have the need for child care like that
sw2854B-ms98-a-0106 430.146000 434.565750 but i agree with you that it's just i call it dumping [laughter] i mean i

sw2854B-ms98-a-0112 453.609875 457.426625 then yeah it's are it's in tandem then
sw2854B-ms98-a-0113 457.426625 466.077125 i just um and there are trade-offs too i think one of the things that is a problem is that um in terms of compensation to some of the child care providers
sw2854B-ms98-a-0114 466.077125 467.766250 um it's just
sw2854B-ms98-a-0115 467.766250 476.943875 you know it's so low but yet the overall cost for somebody doing it on a daily or even a weekly basis it's prohibitive and some people that are not making more than twenty thousand a year

sw2854B-ms98-a-0128 528.237250 532.691500 is that is child care or that type of idea completely foreign to them

sw2854B-ms98-a-0141 577.322625 586.349125 there were enlightening things that broke some of my stereotypical thoughts i'm digressing here but uh i was just real curious when you said Middle East if you didn't mind me asking
sw2854B-ms98-a-0142 586.349125 591.626625 oh no that's okay [laughter] well even if you did that's okay actually i think
