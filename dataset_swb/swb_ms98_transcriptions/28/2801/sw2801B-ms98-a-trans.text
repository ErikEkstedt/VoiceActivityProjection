sw2801B-ms98-a-0054 213.541375 219.655125 eighty one and got rid of it in eighty eight so it was seven years old and had almost a hundred thousand miles on it
sw2801B-ms98-a-0055 219.655125 232.014875 yeah and i- i mean i never had any problem with it and i've got an Accord now and other than you know minor tune-ups like with the the choke and stuff i've never had any problem with it so i've been really lucky

sw2801B-ms98-a-0076 303.987625 306.868375 we've been looking recently just
sw2801B-ms98-a-0077 306.868375 311.895875 you know mainly window shopping but um we've been thinking more American just
sw2801B-ms98-a-0078 311.895875 314.568375 because we want a bigger car this time
sw2801B-ms98-a-0079 314.568375 316.989500 and we've been looking at um
sw2801B-ms98-a-0080 316.989500 323.659250 Crown Victoria and Grand Marquis and we're leaning a little bit towards
sw2801B-ms98-a-0081 323.659250 325.382125 the uh
sw2801B-ms98-a-0082 325.382125 335.565875 Grand Marquis as far as just looks but my parents have a um Continental and they've had nothing but nightmares with that car 
sw2801B-ms98-a-0083 335.565875 341.552500 it's been it's been one thing after another going wrong that the local dealer
sw2801B-ms98-a-0084 341.552500 351.033250 either says there's nothing wrong it's your imagination or says well it's supposed to be that way just get used to it it's been an absolute nightmare for them
sw2801B-ms98-a-0085 351.033250 356.136750 so it kind of makes me dread going back to an American manufacturer
sw2801B-ms98-a-0086 356.136750 367.588125 [silence]
sw2801B-ms98-a-0087 367.588125 369.238375 yeah

sw2801B-ms98-a-0111 472.868875 478.287500 and i don['t]- i don't think people mind too much taking the car in for a a tune-up
sw2801B-ms98-a-0112 478.287500 488.869125 you know just general fifteen thousand mile maintenance or or even getting the oil changed if they know that they're not going to have any other major problems that they'll have to pay for on top of that
sw2801B-ms98-a-0113 488.869125 491.031875 [silence]
sw2801B-ms98-a-0114 491.031875 495.764250 what did they used to say Ford stood for fix or repair daily

sw2801B-ms98-a-0118 506.237125 509.329250 i wonder why they can't extend the truck's
sw2801B-ms98-a-0119 509.329250 513.704250 you know reliability out to the cars i mean i don't know

sw2801B-ms98-a-0128 552.564625 558.751125 i think they need to uh take a look at and see what they can't figure out what the catch is there
sw2801B-ms98-a-0129 558.751125 568.978125 [silence]
sw2801B-ms98-a-0130 568.978125 579.249875 yeah and you know like i said i've had i've had great luck with the Hondas and it's kind of hard to walk away from a good thing when it's you know you're not sure what you're going to get when you change
