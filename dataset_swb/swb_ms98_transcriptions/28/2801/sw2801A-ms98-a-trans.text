sw2801A-ms98-a-0003 4.507875 12.887625 well i do a little bit i just do mainly you know change the oil and uh i'll do an occasional tune-up things like that change set of disc brakes
sw2801A-ms98-a-0004 12.887625 20.096375 but most of the stuff i have done i just don't have time to fool with it or you know it's just out of my technical expertise

sw2801A-ms98-a-0006 21.979500 23.601625 one of each

sw2801A-ms98-a-0012 51.220625 52.917625 [silence]
sw2801A-ms98-a-0013 52.917625 56.668375 well you've got to have a different set of tools for it and everything else too so
sw2801A-ms98-a-0014 56.668375 60.959125 yeah metric well even even some American cars have that now but uh
sw2801A-ms98-a-0015 60.959125 65.992625 uh they're still a little bit over all simpler you know to work on but uh
sw2801A-ms98-a-0016 65.992625 69.622500 i feel like if if i can afford to have it done i'm going to have it done
sw2801A-ms98-a-0017 69.622500 79.441500 [silence]
sw2801A-ms98-a-0018 79.441500 81.145625 yeah
sw2801A-ms98-a-0019 81.145625 84.528000 [noise] well have you had anything done to yours lately or
sw2801A-ms98-a-0020 84.528000 88.537375 [silence]
sw2801A-ms98-a-0021 88.537375 90.075625 um-hum

sw2801A-ms98-a-0023 96.232250 98.519125 yeah automatic choke
sw2801A-ms98-a-0024 98.519125 101.144250 how much did that cost you to have that fixed
sw2801A-ms98-a-0025 101.144250 108.315625 [silence]
sw2801A-ms98-a-0026 108.315625 109.690000 yeah
sw2801A-ms98-a-0027 109.690000 111.701375 not cheap like it used to be
sw2801A-ms98-a-0028 111.701375 116.502250 [silence]
sw2801A-ms98-a-0029 116.502250 122.239125 yeah i've had uh we have a Volvo and uh i had some steering problems
sw2801A-ms98-a-0030 122.239125 127.274250 and it ended up being the entire rack and pinion steering assembly
sw2801A-ms98-a-0031 127.274250 130.853000 and by the time i got everything done
sw2801A-ms98-a-0032 130.853000 133.144625 it was twelve hundred bucks
sw2801A-ms98-a-0033 133.144625 134.851125 [laughter]
sw2801A-ms98-a-0034 134.851125 142.439750 so something something that small and that minor uh well it's not really minor but something that small can cost that much money
sw2801A-ms98-a-0035 142.439750 143.843625 [silence]
sw2801A-ms98-a-0036 143.843625 145.947125 well it's five years old
sw2801A-ms98-a-0037 145.947125 146.933500 but
sw2801A-ms98-a-0038 146.933500 153.438750 but still it doesn't have that many miles it's got uh just over sixty five thousand miles on it and rack and pinion steerings
sw2801A-ms98-a-0039 153.438750 157.089750 uh i don't think i've ever heard of one going out
sw2801A-ms98-a-0040 157.089750 161.911750 [silence]
sw2801A-ms98-a-0041 161.911750 167.652625 the uh the guy that i talked to that replaced it he said i just he said we've never really had to replace one
sw2801A-ms98-a-0042 167.652625 173.825125 we've had to go in and do some adjustments but never replace one but the actual gear teeth on this one had had broken
sw2801A-ms98-a-0043 173.825125 180.284625 so i think it was a de[fect]- defect and i tried to get the Volvo Corporation to cover it but they just refused to do it
sw2801A-ms98-a-0044 180.284625 187.311875 so i just rather than get tied up in in a bunch of you know garbage i just went ahead and and got it done and and to heck with it
sw2801A-ms98-a-0045 187.311875 191.400625 but uh and then the the truck i have i have uh
sw2801A-ms98-a-0046 191.400625 200.498625 i've had just virtually excellent luck with it and other than taking in for just regular warranty work and things like that it's it's been a real good truck
sw2801A-ms98-a-0047 200.498625 218.762875 [silence]
sw2801A-ms98-a-0048 218.762875 220.913625 they're good cars
sw2801A-ms98-a-0049 220.913625 231.547875 [silence]
sw2801A-ms98-a-0050 231.547875 235.139125 i had a i had a Honda Accord uh it was uh
sw2801A-ms98-a-0051 235.139125 237.922500 trying to think what year it was uh
sw2801A-ms98-a-0052 237.922500 242.795250 i think it was an eighty eight or eighty seven eighty seven
sw2801A-ms98-a-0053 242.795250 243.858625 [silence]
sw2801A-ms98-a-0054 243.858625 245.500125 and uh
sw2801A-ms98-a-0055 245.500125 250.421000 it's the the was the LXI with the the fuel injection is that what you have
sw2801A-ms98-a-0056 250.421000 251.790000 [silence]
sw2801A-ms98-a-0057 251.790000 256.616375 i think it still has fuel injection there's i think the DX is the one that does not
sw2801A-ms98-a-0058 256.616375 261.511000 but uh they are probably one of the nicest running cars i've ever driven
sw2801A-ms98-a-0059 261.511000 264.373375 they run good and they're and they're peppy
sw2801A-ms98-a-0060 264.373375 272.989375 [silence]
sw2801A-ms98-a-0061 272.989375 285.358875 yeah i- i will i don't i don't think i'd ever buy another Volvo i bought it mainly uh for my wife and daughter for safety more than anything and i thought well it'd be an investment we'll be able to keep it for ten or twelve years
sw2801A-ms98-a-0062 285.358875 291.118875 and uh i- i don't think i'd buy another one only because the maintenance costs are very very high
sw2801A-ms98-a-0063 291.118875 297.879500 and that's just a little bit out of my range it's enough just to buy it without uh having the other problems but uh
sw2801A-ms98-a-0064 297.879500 300.348125 i will definitely go ba[ck]- go to uh
sw2801A-ms98-a-0065 300.348125 304.622875 now go back to Honda or Mazda or something like that next time
sw2801A-ms98-a-0066 304.622875 311.498250 [silence]

sw2801A-ms98-a-0071 334.918750 336.681625 oh really
sw2801A-ms98-a-0072 336.681625 350.392500 [silence]
sw2801A-ms98-a-0073 350.392500 351.681625 hum
sw2801A-ms98-a-0074 351.681625 355.585875 [silence]
sw2801A-ms98-a-0075 355.585875 359.538000 that's been i think until they get the reliability up
sw2801A-ms98-a-0076 359.538000 368.239250 i don't you know other than trucks i've had always had good luck with American trucks but with cars i i've not had much luck with uh American cars especially General Motors
sw2801A-ms98-a-0077 368.239250 378.070750 but uh you know i look at reliability and and you know like stuff like tires and and belts and stuff like that uh actually
sw2801A-ms98-a-0078 378.070750 383.168875 you can buy the parts cheaper for foreign cars if you buy them_1 and put them_1 in yourself
sw2801A-ms98-a-0079 383.168875 387.876750 but if you have to have it done of course it ends up costing you the installation fee but
sw2801A-ms98-a-0080 387.876750 397.080875 i have had if i had to say dollar for dollar spending on foreign and as opposed to to American i spent far less on the foreign cars
sw2801A-ms98-a-0081 397.080875 402.867750 long term a lot a lot more and then then you add the the fuel savings on top of it
sw2801A-ms98-a-0082 402.867750 408.672375 so my money's on foreign cars until Amer[ican]- until the American cars can can meet the standards
sw2801A-ms98-a-0083 408.672375 411.552625 [silence]
sw2801A-ms98-a-0084 411.552625 425.422625 well that that's interesting that you say that because if you'll start looking now at some of the Hondas and some of the Mazdas and and a lot of the car companies now are beginning to scale up you know like the the Lexus
sw2801A-ms98-a-0085 425.422625 430.379375 see those cars if if you'll go look at them they're as big as some of the General Motors cars
sw2801A-ms98-a-0086 430.379375 437.298375 if you if you put them_1 side by side and i- i didn't really notice it until someone pointed it out he says well if you'll look and see what's happening
sw2801A-ms98-a-0087 437.298375 439.068875 foreign cars
sw2801A-ms98-a-0088 439.068875 450.658125 are able to keep the same ga[s]- or keep keep good gas mileage good reliability but they're scaling up whereas the Americans now are scaling down and they can't improve the gas mileage anymore
sw2801A-ms98-a-0089 450.658125 455.656750 so the J[apanese]- the Japanese have have definitely beat us in both sides of the game
sw2801A-ms98-a-0090 455.656750 461.296000 they they thought you know build them small cheap a[nd]- you know and and little repair
sw2801A-ms98-a-0091 461.296000 467.004500 and you know get them_1 hooked and then start slowly adding stuff on
sw2801A-ms98-a-0092 467.004500 474.105250 and people like the reliability but they also like the size and now they're sizing up they've got the reliability and they've got the gas mileage you know
sw2801A-ms98-a-0093 474.105250 487.741250 [silence]
sw2801A-ms98-a-0094 487.741250 491.515375 that's right and with American cars and the warranties you don't know
sw2801A-ms98-a-0095 491.515375 494.944375 [silence]
sw2801A-ms98-a-0096 494.944375 498.008875 yeah except i've got a Ford truck
sw2801A-ms98-a-0097 498.008875 500.778750 and i know a lot of people that have Ford trucks
sw2801A-ms98-a-0098 500.778750 503.160875 and really they're very maintenance free
sw2801A-ms98-a-0099 503.160875 506.572500 from i now i- i- i speaking only from trucks
sw2801A-ms98-a-0100 506.572500 512.368875 [silence]
sw2801A-ms98-a-0101 512.368875 522.794875 i don't know that's su[rprising]- surprising because you know everybody i know that has a Ford car has had nothing but trouble with it but th[ey]- they have a Ford truck and they're they're virtually uh flawless
sw2801A-ms98-a-0102 522.794875 528.743125 the uh th[e]- the undercarriage and everything else if you put them next to a Chevy or or another type of truck
sw2801A-ms98-a-0103 528.743125 532.561250 American truck you can't even come close to a Ford
sw2801A-ms98-a-0104 532.561250 535.241125 and uh that's why i buy Ford trucks
sw2801A-ms98-a-0105 535.241125 541.347000 mine runs like a top it it i've like i say i've had absolutely nothing wrong with it other than taking it in for normal maintenance
sw2801A-ms98-a-0106 541.347000 545.232875 and uh and i- i put over a hundred miles a day on it
sw2801A-ms98-a-0107 545.232875 548.114250 and i've never i've never had trouble with it
sw2801A-ms98-a-0108 548.114250 552.510750 so i'll buy Ford trucks but i'll buy foreign cars
sw2801A-ms98-a-0109 552.510750 557.846750 [silence]
sw2801A-ms98-a-0110 557.846750 570.126625 i know it's it's it's kind of kind of crazy but i don't know but but until they until they meet the standards that you know that i'm used to anyway that you know i'll i'll buy what whatever i get you know that's best for my money
sw2801A-ms98-a-0111 570.126625 575.592125 [silence]
sw2801A-ms98-a-0112 575.592125 576.974500 yeah

sw2801A-ms98-a-0114 578.356875 582.651125 they're they're good cars i- i- i will say that you probably made a good choice
sw2801A-ms98-a-0115 582.651125 583.941250 in that one
sw2801A-ms98-a-0116 583.941250 587.820750 but how about_1 have you had tires changed on on that car
sw2801A-ms98-a-0117 587.820750 590.651875 [silence]
