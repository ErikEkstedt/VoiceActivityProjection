sw2861B-ms98-a-0099 417.587625 430.934250 oh i know but you know usually there in this uh new i've got one on this there's usually one neighbor in the in on a block that d[oesn't]- doesn't take care of their yard as or doesn't do anything to the yard and i keep thinking why do th[e]- people buy homes
sw2861B-ms98-a-0100 430.934250 440.788875 if they're not going to keep their yard why don't you stay in an apartment if you're not going to touch your yard you're not going to you know you just ruin it for everybody else i think i know where my daughter lives there's a woman that lives behind them
sw2861B-ms98-a-0101 440.788875 452.311375 that the yard has never been watered and she lives in a real nice neighborhood and it it's i saw it for the first time this morning what a eyeso[re]- eyesore that was i said i'd run her out
sw2861B-ms98-a-0102 452.311375 460.558500 that's a shame that somebody let their yard she has poison ivy growing over her garage can you believe poison i[vy]- and she's got children
sw2861B-ms98-a-0103 460.558500 464.848875 and it's just oh what an eyesore terrible
sw2861B-ms98-a-0104 464.848875 471.244375 but no i i really do like my neighborhood it's close enough to DFW i can be at the airport in ten minutes
sw2861B-ms98-a-0105 471.244375 479.087625 but i can't hear the planes flying i can see them uh from upstairs i can almost watch them land on the runway but i can't hear them for some reason
sw2861B-ms98-a-0106 479.087625 489.483500 and uh uh i like living real close to an airport because when i get home from a trip i want to get home i don't want to drive forty five minutes you know after i get home i want to be home
sw2861B-ms98-a-0107 489.483500 497.215375 so i i always choose to live by an airport in Orlando i did the same thing i lived right by the airport so i could get right home
sw2861B-ms98-a-0108 497.215375 502.923125 and the the noise isn't real i say i can't hear this and and when i lived in Orlando i couldn't hear the airplanes either
sw2861B-ms98-a-0109 502.923125 515.194625 i guess if i lived right on the flight pattern it would be different but uh i don't i like i like to watch airplanes a fact i can lay in my bed at night and watch the planes coming in DFW and i'm
sw2861B-ms98-a-0110 515.194625 521.378875 i- i know if they're two seconds apart or just watch the lights come over they must come all in from the same pattern
sw2861B-ms98-a-0111 521.378875 534.969750 and i can just lay there and just just watch one come past the the roof line of the people across the [vocalized-noise] street from me and uh just like seem like every two seconds i'll see them come in from about you know nine o'clock to ten fifteen they're just streaming in
sw2861B-ms98-a-0112 534.969750 536.762500 [silence]

sw2861B-ms98-a-0115 550.814375 555.973750 there must be thirty airplanes circling above not over my house but over DFW
sw2861B-ms98-a-0116 555.973750 558.909875 it's the weirdest looking sign i thought my i guess they're
sw2861B-ms98-a-0117 558.909875 564.947250 i don't know why they're all circling i guess they're but it's weird looking so many lights up in the sky
sw2861B-ms98-a-0118 564.947250 568.830875 but i i guess it's interesting uh i like to look at airplanes
