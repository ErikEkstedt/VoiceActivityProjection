sw2861A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.377875 [silence]
sw2861A-ms98-a-0002 1.377875 5.875375 well we we bought more than we can afford [noise]
sw2861A-ms98-a-0003 5.875375 7.479750 [vocalized-noise] and uh 
sw2861A-ms98-a-0004 7.479750 10.017875 so we're in a fairly uh
sw2861A-ms98-a-0005 10.017875 14.156625 exclusive neighborhood and got a big house
sw2861A-ms98-a-0006 14.156625 16.764875 five thousand square feet with
sw2861A-ms98-a-0007 16.764875 18.866750 a bunch of kids running around
sw2861A-ms98-a-0008 18.866750 23.756500 and horrible real estate taxes and and everything else
sw2861A-ms98-a-0009 23.756500 25.810625 so it's about all we can afford
sw2861A-ms98-a-0010 25.810625 37.720125 [silence]
sw2861A-ms98-a-0011 37.720125 40.606875 [noise] uh-huh
sw2861A-ms98-a-0012 40.606875 63.972125 [silence]
sw2861A-ms98-a-0013 63.972125 65.368875 uh-huh
sw2861A-ms98-a-0014 65.368875 83.546875 [silence]
sw2861A-ms98-a-0015 83.546875 89.970375 well that's interesting because i i've i heard around Dallas that uh real estate was up for grabs
sw2861A-ms98-a-0016 89.970375 93.810125 [silence]
sw2861A-ms98-a-0017 93.810125 95.161125 uh-huh
sw2861A-ms98-a-0018 95.161125 117.195375 [silence]
sw2861A-ms98-a-0019 117.195375 118.819750 uh-huh
sw2861A-ms98-a-0020 118.819750 126.099625 [silence]
sw2861A-ms98-a-0021 126.099625 128.308750 yeah
sw2861A-ms98-a-0022 128.308750 132.149500 [silence]
sw2861A-ms98-a-0023 132.149500 135.869625 well we've sort of got the other end of the spectrum going here the uh
sw2861A-ms98-a-0024 135.869625 142.041500 we had Mobil Oil Corporation move their corporate headquarters here about five years ago
sw2861A-ms98-a-0025 142.041500 146.156125 and i bought this house uh just before they moved down
sw2861A-ms98-a-0026 146.156125 153.441000 and when they moved in here the price on houses just about doubled all over the area
sw2861A-ms98-a-0027 153.441000 155.445000 and uh
sw2861A-ms98-a-0028 155.445000 159.220000 so we we got ours at a a fairly good price
sw2861A-ms98-a-0029 159.220000 163.948500 but it stimulated a lot of the builders to start building fancy homes
sw2861A-ms98-a-0030 163.948500 166.671875 and so we've got a lot of houses
sw2861A-ms98-a-0031 166.671875 172.034125 within a a few miles of us that are one million million and a half
sw2861A-ms98-a-0032 172.034125 174.621250 and uh
sw2861A-ms98-a-0033 174.621250 175.785875 [silence]
sw2861A-ms98-a-0034 175.785875 179.479375 yeah it helps the value of our property except we
sw2861A-ms98-a-0035 179.479375 183.627375 except we had a neighbor here [vocalized-noise] just about gave his house away
sw2861A-ms98-a-0036 183.627375 188.718875 uh he sold it for only slightly more than he paid for it uh four five years ago
sw2861A-ms98-a-0037 188.718875 190.476125 and uh
sw2861A-ms98-a-0038 190.476125 199.520625 so he's kind of knocked down the neighborhood for a little while until that that average goes out but an awful lot of these fancy homes are not selling
sw2861A-ms98-a-0039 199.520625 205.649125 because they built them and put all this money into them and nobody's interested in buying
sw2861A-ms98-a-0040 205.649125 253.971875 [silence]
sw2861A-ms98-a-0041 253.971875 255.282875 uh-huh
sw2861A-ms98-a-0042 255.282875 257.650625 [silence]
sw2861A-ms98-a-0043 257.650625 262.826000 well they're doing some some strange things here i think that the price of real estate's gotten so high
sw2861A-ms98-a-0044 262.826000 270.797875 and they're trying to get the value out of the homes so they subdivide around here they'll put a million dollar home on a half acre lot
sw2861A-ms98-a-0045 270.797875 274.743875 and you know you put a five thousand square foot house on
sw2861A-ms98-a-0046 274.743875 281.718250 on a half acre lot or one a[cre]- you know half acre lot and you can clip the lawn with a pair of scissors
sw2861A-ms98-a-0047 281.718250 316.522500 [silence]
sw2861A-ms98-a-0048 316.522500 318.163250 [laughter]

sw2861A-ms98-a-0052 327.319250 333.529875 well sometimes it uh keeping after the yard gets me we enjoy sailing quite a bit
sw2861A-ms98-a-0053 333.529875 336.765750 and sometimes we go off on a one week cruise
sw2861A-ms98-a-0054 336.765750 341.444250 and i come back it's rained quite a bit while we're gone i can hardly find the house [laughter]
sw2861A-ms98-a-0055 341.444250 365.476000 [silence]
sw2861A-ms98-a-0056 365.476000 366.926000 uh-huh

sw2861A-ms98-a-0058 386.010875 387.406250 um
sw2861A-ms98-a-0059 387.406250 392.669875 [silence]
sw2861A-ms98-a-0060 392.669875 397.832875 yeah that's one of the things i have to face up to there's uh quite a few retired people in our neighborhood
sw2861A-ms98-a-0061 397.832875 405.343875 and it seems like all they have to do is is go out there and put down lime and spread fertilizer and pull up dandelions and
sw2861A-ms98-a-0062 405.343875 417.123375 take care of their lawn as b[eautiful]- beautiful lawn and i come over and look at my lawn and this nicely cut crabgrass and [laughter-uh] dandelions and plantains and everything else under the sun coming up
sw2861A-ms98-a-0063 417.123375 418.980625 [vocalized-noise] the uh
sw2861A-ms98-a-0064 418.980625 457.345500 [silence]
sw2861A-ms98-a-0065 457.345500 458.549750 um
sw2861A-ms98-a-0066 458.549750 476.500500 [silence]
sw2861A-ms98-a-0067 476.500500 477.711750 yeah
sw2861A-ms98-a-0068 477.711750 495.764750 [silence]
sw2861A-ms98-a-0069 495.764750 497.830125 yeah
sw2861A-ms98-a-0070 497.830125 520.962750 [silence]
sw2861A-ms98-a-0071 520.962750 522.315750 uh-huh
sw2861A-ms98-a-0072 522.315750 534.468125 [silence]
sw2861A-ms98-a-0073 534.468125 536.971625 is that your version of counting sheep
sw2861A-ms98-a-0074 536.971625 540.207250 [laughter]
sw2861A-ms98-a-0075 540.207250 555.447000 [silence]
sw2861A-ms98-a-0076 555.447000 556.780000 uh-huh
sw2861A-ms98-a-0077 556.780000 564.363875 [silence]
sw2861A-ms98-a-0078 564.363875 565.944625 yeah
sw2861A-ms98-a-0079 565.944625 567.676125 [silence]
sw2861A-ms98-a-0080 567.676125 573.115125 well we're kind of fortunate we're right about halfway between National Airport and Dallas
sw2861A-ms98-a-0081 573.115125 577.899875 and so they've uh sort of established sort of a no man's land here
sw2861A-ms98-a-0082 577.899875 583.792500 and so we don't get any traffic from Dulles over the house and we don't get any traffic from uh National
sw2861A-ms98-a-0083 583.792500 589.944000 and but you can sit in the backyard and you can watch the planes uh lining up for the approach
sw2861A-ms98-a-0084 589.944000 595.909500 [silence]
sw2861A-ms98-a-0085 595.909500 601.051375 yeah that's that's not well it's about forty five minute drive from here ye[ah]-
