sw2869A-ms98-a-0010 38.993750 48.008250 no i don't people move to the suburbs to Richardson and Plano uh uh mostly because of the school district because of the level of education that's offered
sw2869A-ms98-a-0011 48.008250 58.410500 [silence]
sw2869A-ms98-a-0012 58.410500 67.884875 yeah well it costs uh so much in taxes here and uh even if they do give money to the poorer school districts i don't think it's going to lower my taxes at all

sw2869A-ms98-a-0019 89.487250 94.054000 i don't think that's going to improve the talent as far as the school teaching uh goes
sw2869A-ms98-a-0020 94.054000 102.987875 [silence]
sw2869A-ms98-a-0021 102.987875 104.852625 yeah

sw2869A-ms98-a-0027 120.800000 126.357750 uh-huh well we need qualified teachers no matter whether they're teaching in the inner city or the suburbs
sw2869A-ms98-a-0028 126.357750 133.508875 uh the trouble is that uh the suburbs are able to pay more that's going to attract the the better uh teachers
sw2869A-ms98-a-0029 133.508875 135.578000 [silence]
sw2869A-ms98-a-0030 135.578000 139.934750 sure and uh it cost more in tax money too so [laughter]

sw2869A-ms98-a-0032 150.451375 154.812875 well it could very well be uh there is a definite racial split here
sw2869A-ms98-a-0033 154.812875 172.676750 [silence]
sw2869A-ms98-a-0034 172.676750 185.225875 well i was in a rural area in Wisconsin and uh we had a good public school system but i don't think it was great i think the curriculum was very deficient to prepare people to go to college
sw2869A-ms98-a-0035 185.225875 193.309625 but uh the the racial mix of um students in my area was entirely white we had uh no minorities at all
sw2869A-ms98-a-0036 193.309625 200.701375 [silence]

sw2869A-ms98-a-0044 243.923250 256.549250 well the good school districts here do have honors programs uh they do encourage that among the students who are uh prepared to go to college but uh that brings up a whole uh bunch of other problems um
sw2869A-ms98-a-0045 256.549250 275.485750 [silence]
sw2869A-ms98-a-0046 275.485750 276.884750 sure

sw2869A-ms98-a-0049 287.109000 288.717375 [silence]
sw2869A-ms98-a-0050 288.717375 298.282250 that's interesting i know some people at work who uh have uh children in high school and they're not satisfied with the school district at all and they do send their kids to the priv[ate]- s[chool]- private schools
sw2869A-ms98-a-0051 298.282250 299.422250 [silence]
sw2869A-ms98-a-0052 299.422250 303.308500 um they send them to Saint Marks i think where ever that's located
sw2869A-ms98-a-0053 303.308500 309.418875 [silence]
sw2869A-ms98-a-0054 309.418875 310.959500 yeah uh-huh

sw2869A-ms98-a-0057 318.731375 323.390000 so you're you're talking about uh college uh level fees here
sw2869A-ms98-a-0058 323.390000 326.238750 [silence]
sw2869A-ms98-a-0059 326.238750 335.235500 sure but i think i think the honors programs are good in the high schools but uh some of the problems you get are the kids that are in those programs get harassed by their peers
sw2869A-ms98-a-0060 335.235500 336.924125 for doing too well
sw2869A-ms98-a-0061 336.924125 338.956750 [silence]
sw2869A-ms98-a-0062 338.956750 341.719625 and that discourages them from doing well
sw2869A-ms98-a-0063 341.719625 343.113625 [laughter] so uh
sw2869A-ms98-a-0064 343.113625 362.743375 [silence]

sw2869A-ms98-a-0074 395.964125 408.375375 i can relate to part of that uh in in my high school uh say just for for example in my math courses uh i i was not to brag about this at all i was so far ahead of everybody else that i didn't have to go to class
sw2869A-ms98-a-0075 408.375375 415.305250 and i got to sit by myself in an empty room while everybody else was in class taking algebra an[d]- work at my own pace
sw2869A-ms98-a-0076 415.305250 423.678875 [silence]

sw2869A-ms98-a-0086 469.574125 477.424750 [silence]
sw2869A-ms98-a-0087 477.424750 484.736625 yeah it got so bad with with this one kid that uh the the school uh called their parents up to ask if there were any problems going on
sw2869A-ms98-a-0088 484.736625 487.636625 because his performance at school had degraded so much
