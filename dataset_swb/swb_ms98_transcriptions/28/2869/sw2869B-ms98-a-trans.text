sw2869B-ms98-a-0003 3.055000 14.610500 uh well we don't have children but um from what our peers tell us um most of them do are not in favor of the way the Dallas public well i shouldn't get specific the way the public education system is run here
sw2869B-ms98-a-0004 14.610500 26.845375 um they just don't feel that um the quality of the teachers and the quality of the uh curriculum and they actually send them to uh the suburban areas i i guess it's okay if i say the area Plano
sw2869B-ms98-a-0005 26.845375 34.451250 um and i think one thing that the state's doing right now about the refunding i think is completely unfair it's not that i
sw2869B-ms98-a-0006 34.451250 35.827500 yeah
sw2869B-ms98-a-0007 35.827500 39.979000 yeah i[s]- is that the basic reason you don't agree with it
sw2869B-ms98-a-0008 39.979000 41.411250 yeah

sw2869B-ms98-a-0010 47.065250 58.768500 yeah and they're already paying for it i mean i you know um i know we used to live in Garland and a lot of the people there sent their kids to private school because um they just didn't like what was going on

sw2869B-ms98-a-0014 67.392000 75.196125 i know it i mean i look at high schools like um what was the one in Richardson J J Pearce High School that just won the national academic some kind of um
sw2869B-ms98-a-0015 75.196125 83.033250 uh championship or tournament that they had for academics and that Richardson is one of the school districts that would be hit by taking away from them
sw2869B-ms98-a-0016 83.033250 87.128625 that's a good way to say it the Robin Hood um approach

sw2869B-ms98-a-0020 93.474125 104.087125 you know i used to work at EDS and Ross Perot you know the big joke sometimes um about him but the one thing he did a few years back in testing the competency of the uh faculty
sw2869B-ms98-a-0021 104.087125 106.695000 i still think that's a good idea
sw2869B-ms98-a-0022 106.695000 110.110000 because i don't i don't know whe[re]- did you go to school in Texas
sw2869B-ms98-a-0023 110.110000 121.725250 and i went to school in Chicago so i can tell you it's probably the same type of thing that um i had a really good education but it wasn't where i went to high school it was an inner city but it the faculty was very good
sw2869B-ms98-a-0024 121.725250 123.333250 and i don't know what y[ou]-
sw2869B-ms98-a-0025 123.333250 125.453250 [silence]

sw2869B-ms98-a-0032 138.135875 151.356250 yeah i mean it's yeah in Texas i don't know i don't if it's because of um the influx of minority uh in terms of that they're trying to please all people and their not pleasing anybody you know i don't know if that's what it is
sw2869B-ms98-a-0033 151.356250 154.008625 i don't know i'm not really
sw2869B-ms98-a-0034 154.008625 159.525125 yeah i mean i don't know if that's exactly it or not but it seems to be a little bit more um
sw2869B-ms98-a-0035 159.525125 165.035250 well i don't know schools in Wisconsin i'm trying to think of some of the things i know about the schools up north compared to down here
sw2869B-ms98-a-0036 165.035250 173.489250 it just seems like down here that unless you're in a suburban entity their SAT scores their reading comprehension levels they're just not as high

sw2869B-ms98-a-0045 202.416500 209.805125 it was very eclectic um but the teachers were what did curriculum i mean they had things like philosophy and journalism i mean
sw2869B-ms98-a-0046 209.805125 223.161125 but there wasn't a uh real for people such as myself that knew they wanted to go to school and knew they wanted to um go to a fairly competitive undergraduate program it wasn't what i would call a uh a career a academic
sw2869B-ms98-a-0047 223.161125 232.132000 pa[th]- preparatory path for college prep um as opposed to suburban schools like Evanston Illinois which has one of the largest [noise] you know
sw2869B-ms98-a-0048 232.132000 237.106250 uh student bodies in the country and the and the money base to go with it um
sw2869B-ms98-a-0049 237.106250 244.630625 i don't know i just look at high schools like Plano East and West and the ones in Richardson and i think well you know i would send a child there

sw2869B-ms98-a-0055 255.245875 265.160000 yeah i mean my high school did have honors programs and i was in it but it really you know in terms of i'm wondering how much different it was compared to in terms of city now there is a high school um
sw2869B-ms98-a-0056 265.160000 276.961500 is it WTT White or is it Jefferson i don't know that much about the Dallas high school system um but i have heard that the of one or two that are very good but out of how many you know fifty to sixty high schools
sw2869B-ms98-a-0057 276.961500 285.766500 it's just um and then i read the other day that Plano was going to be the site for a possibly new um parochial or Catholic high school
sw2869B-ms98-a-0058 285.766500 290.994125 something like to be one of the largest ones in the Southwest or something yeah

sw2869B-ms98-a-0063 301.295500 310.108500 okay yeah yeah that's one of the more um yeah i have some friends that uh have younger children and they send them to the Montessori system
sw2869B-ms98-a-0064 310.108500 315.198500 um and when you hear what they're paying you just [laughter]

sw2869B-ms98-a-0072 341.256125 351.736875 uh-huh i don't know i think one thing the United States does um my stepfather's from England and one thing they do their at least in in the section of London where he was from that they um
sw2869B-ms98-a-0073 351.736875 359.942250 they actually they call them externships but they actually the child's um uh they go by forms they don't go by grades and i guess i guess
sw2869B-ms98-a-0074 359.942250 366.525375 what would be the equivalent of our early high school nine tenth grade they call it the tenth of eleventh form um
sw2869B-ms98-a-0075 366.525375 380.417375 they actually are forced to take time off and pick an area of study it's proctored it's you know regulated and all that sort of thing um but they actually are supposed to go to the library and do their own thing on a particular subject and it doesn't matter what it is
sw2869B-ms98-a-0076 380.417375 384.547875 it has to be academic but they it's free of their choosing
sw2869B-ms98-a-0077 384.547875 392.175375 right in that one just for that one particular semester quarter or what ever you know that one quarter uh a study unit would be 
sw2869B-ms98-a-0078 392.175375 396.930750 and i don't know i don't think we do enough of that here in terms of getting children to think independently

sw2869B-ms98-a-0086 414.824250 424.438250 that's kind of what i'm talking about i mean um uh i mean we can only speak from personal experience and i'm not bragging either but it's the same thing i mean i took AP or advanced placement classes
sw2869B-ms98-a-0087 424.438250 432.458000 and i[t]- there were things that i probably knew about in other segments but they just didn't offer them i mean they offered them in things like English and chemistry
sw2869B-ms98-a-0088 432.458000 438.792750 two things that were obscure to what i was interested in in terms of um a career um
sw2869B-ms98-a-0089 438.792750 450.738125 i think part of the thing about schools today is too is the way the families have gone down the tubes the structure that now teachers play police officers you know their parenting their disciplinarians
sw2869B-ms98-a-0090 450.738125 456.251500 you know and i'm doing thi[s]- all this second hand we don't have any kids in school or anything so i can't

sw2869B-ms98-a-0098 487.132625 498.841750 i mean i wouldn't want to be growing up now a days that's one thing um but i don't know how you solve that you know those are social problems the academic problem i don't know i think of two or three things in my mind i think teachers should be tested
sw2869B-ms98-a-0099 498.841750 508.043000 and they probably would shoot me if they heard that and i know a lot of teachers um two i think that they should leave the funding or the money where the proven programs are
sw2869B-ms98-a-0100 508.043000 516.092875 and three i do think that parents need to be more involved i don't know i just it's probably easy to say because none of us have children but um i just

sw2869B-ms98-a-0108 539.536000 553.659125 the man we were all upon the topic of adoption which may be in our future um if we're real lucky at any rate he was saying how he was glad that his two children one biological one natural um this had to do with the adopt[ed]- the adopted one which
sw2869B-ms98-a-0109 553.659125 567.312750 biological i mean one adopted one natural um that's irrelevant but he was saying that uh my husband said and what does your son is very good looking what is he well he's nineteen he graduated last year um but he's interested in theater and he's just going to Richland and
sw2869B-ms98-a-0110 567.312750 580.937625 he said you know he said i'm not calling him stupid or slow he just he said he did really didn't want to study and he goes and you know he leaned over to my husband and he said well you know so and so he said when you have them if you get one what you'll understand is you'll just be glad if they don't you don't get a call from the police
sw2869B-ms98-a-0111 580.937625 592.802000 and he said our son Mark you know blah blah blah um he may be have only been a C student but we've never had trouble with him he said and when you raise a child in today's society he you're just glad they make it through school
