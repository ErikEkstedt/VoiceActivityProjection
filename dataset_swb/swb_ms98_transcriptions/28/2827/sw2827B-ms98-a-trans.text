sw2827B-ms98-a-0024 95.033625 97.665375 that would be great have you made pasta before

sw2827B-ms98-a-0028 107.896125 118.283250 it actually is if if if you have a food processor i don't know if you have a food processor or not actually it it turns out that i[f]- i[f]- if if you really want to be nice and easy about it you can make the dough in the food processor really simply
sw2827B-ms98-a-0029 118.283250 130.342125 and then um and with that it it becomes really easy to make colorful pasta by throwing in some spinach or some tomato or something and mixing it up it it it it's just a snap from there and then you get to roll it out yourself
sw2827B-ms98-a-0030 130.342125 133.358625 i made y[ucky]- i making yucky every now and then as well
sw2827B-ms98-a-0031 133.358625 141.101625 it's also people think it's real hard it just [vocalized-noise] it just time consuming to get all of the little things right otherwise it's real simple it's good stuff

sw2827B-ms98-a-0046 184.625250 189.504750 well that yeah that's the way these things sort of make it is you make it for one person as an experiment and
sw2827B-ms98-a-0047 189.504750 196.008000 i usually find it when i make up for the first time i usually doctor it just a little bit you know my own way here and there and it works real well
sw2827B-ms98-a-0048 196.008000 205.139250 [silence]
sw2827B-ms98-a-0049 205.139250 207.048625 that just means you're a real cook

sw2827B-ms98-a-0051 215.352625 218.362375 it's real good yeah we have a
sw2827B-ms98-a-0052 218.362375 220.133875 we do uh
sw2827B-ms98-a-0053 220.133875 228.815500 uh middle eastern dinner quite a bit actually or uh we have people other that have never experienced it before and haven't had much much middle eastern food
sw2827B-ms98-a-0054 228.815500 230.568750 we make uh
sw2827B-ms98-a-0055 230.568750 242.267000 because_1 we're my wife is Syrian yeah and um her family's always had this food she grew up in and i've made some of it before as well so we make uh four or five middle eastern dishes that are just all real simple
sw2827B-ms98-a-0056 242.267000 248.338500 we put them out for people and and that's always a real big kick for people who want you know who've never tried it before
sw2827B-ms98-a-0057 248.338500 254.009625 that's [vocalized-noise] that's [vocalized-noise] that tha[t]- that's a fun idea i mean if you ever uh want something di[fferent]- try
