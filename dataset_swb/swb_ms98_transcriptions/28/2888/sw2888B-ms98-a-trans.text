sw2888B-ms98-a-0061 215.512375 222.494750 it's it takes a lot more time to read something and you've got news bombarding you from everywhere now you know you turn on the TV turn on the radio

sw2888B-ms98-a-0065 245.943625 247.994875 yeah i just
sw2888B-ms98-a-0066 247.994875 253.520625 i find it hard to believe that people'll go back to reading over television i mean just given the way
sw2888B-ms98-a-0067 253.520625 258.902250 society is and i enjoy reading but most people would rather turn on the tube and
sw2888B-ms98-a-0068 258.902250 263.205125 and and flip through the channels you know and get the headline news that thirty minutes of
sw2888B-ms98-a-0069 263.205125 264.356625 [silence]
sw2888B-ms98-a-0070 264.356625 266.025625 right
sw2888B-ms98-a-0071 266.025625 268.734750 and they don't have to go get one you know

sw2888B-ms98-a-0076 294.467125 301.589000 well that's why i like uh national public radio because_1 when they get on one of these little they they give you headlines that are brief
sw2888B-ms98-a-0077 301.589000 306.292875 just they touch on what's going on and then they'll get into something and really explore it
sw2888B-ms98-a-0078 306.292875 311.526125 and it's it's informative it's a lot more informative than you know a quick half hour news show that
sw2888B-ms98-a-0079 311.526125 313.593250 they tell you what they want you to hear
sw2888B-ms98-a-0080 313.593250 317.230375 [silence]

sw2888B-ms98-a-0085 333.003750 335.644500 communication you know spans the world now and
sw2888B-ms98-a-0086 335.644500 339.198500 there's too much going on you can't afford to give more than a couple of seconds here and there

sw2888B-ms98-a-0090 352.357750 363.826375 and the question is how much of it or s[ome]- how some of it i guess there's a lot of debate about censorship and and what we're really seeing is it is it the true story or is it a little bit biased

sw2888B-ms98-a-0097 411.511250 413.303375 you know you get in the habit of
sw2888B-ms98-a-0098 413.303375 420.054250 like i say turn on Headline News and it'll play [laughter-over] and over and you just tune it out because it's the same thing but
