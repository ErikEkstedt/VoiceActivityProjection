sw2888A-ms98-a-0008 30.709000 40.081000 it's kind of losing its importance like on in in on radio if you hear any news at all it's like two seconds you know really quickly on regular stations
sw2888A-ms98-a-0009 40.081000 44.349125 [silence]

sw2888A-ms98-a-0018 69.649750 77.602500 yeah i usually don't intentionally although i should i don't intentionally turn on the television to watch news
sw2888A-ms98-a-0019 77.602500 80.975125 or i don't intentionally turn on the radio to listen to the news
sw2888A-ms98-a-0020 80.975125 83.783750 if it comes on i just happen to hear it
sw2888A-ms98-a-0021 83.783750 87.364250 now i will intentionally buy a newspaper to wa[tch]- to
sw2888A-ms98-a-0022 87.364250 89.992500 to look at the news but other than
sw2888A-ms98-a-0023 89.992500 91.653000 [silence]
sw2888A-ms98-a-0024 91.653000 92.971750 yeah that's true

sw2888A-ms98-a-0026 93.996125 104.744750 [laughter-that's] about it the Sunday paper it's so full of stuff but you pick your favorite section and the rest you throw away although you paid what almost two dollars now to get it but
sw2888A-ms98-a-0027 104.744750 105.797000 [silence]
sw2888A-ms98-a-0028 105.797000 106.849250 yeah

sw2888A-ms98-a-0032 114.678750 118.000000 [silence]
sw2888A-ms98-a-0033 118.000000 122.177000 is it is it pretty good coverage on there i mean um-hum
sw2888A-ms98-a-0034 122.177000 125.598500 [silence]
sw2888A-ms98-a-0035 125.598500 128.119125 yeah yeah
sw2888A-ms98-a-0036 128.119125 129.290500 hum
sw2888A-ms98-a-0037 129.290500 130.835875 [silence]
sw2888A-ms98-a-0038 130.835875 137.609125 because_1 i find like on KRLD i like to listen to that but each story is like no more than two or three lines
sw2888A-ms98-a-0039 137.609125 139.755750 you know so it's
sw2888A-ms98-a-0040 139.755750 140.985625 yeah
sw2888A-ms98-a-0041 140.985625 142.071000 [silence]
sw2888A-ms98-a-0042 142.071000 143.269500 uh-huh
sw2888A-ms98-a-0043 143.269500 145.544875 [silence]
sw2888A-ms98-a-0044 145.544875 147.866250 yeah that'd probably be better
sw2888A-ms98-a-0045 147.866250 153.314375 especially when you listen to the like popular radio stations like mostly the music stations
sw2888A-ms98-a-0046 153.314375 159.440750 news is is pretty much nonexistent they'll have little little teeny weeny news breaks you know
sw2888A-ms98-a-0047 159.440750 160.652250 [silence]
sw2888A-ms98-a-0048 160.652250 163.264500 yeah yeah basically
sw2888A-ms98-a-0049 163.264500 165.830000 [silence]
sw2888A-ms98-a-0050 165.830000 167.432750 yeah
sw2888A-ms98-a-0051 167.432750 170.830500 so let's see um
sw2888A-ms98-a-0052 170.830500 178.529250 [silence]
sw2888A-ms98-a-0053 178.529250 179.677250 uh-huh
sw2888A-ms98-a-0054 179.677250 184.353875 the only reason i get trade journals is like if i'm looking for a job or [laughter-something]
sw2888A-ms98-a-0055 184.353875 186.052250 which is what i'm doing now
sw2888A-ms98-a-0056 186.052250 190.898625 but uh yeah [laughter] trying to get out of wherever they are
sw2888A-ms98-a-0057 190.898625 193.341250 but uh i think i think news is
sw2888A-ms98-a-0058 193.341250 195.622750 i'm wondering where it's going
sw2888A-ms98-a-0059 195.622750 197.271375 you know how
sw2888A-ms98-a-0060 197.271375 202.184000 i think it would be nonex[istent]- pretty [laughter-much] nonexistent except maybe through the paper
sw2888A-ms98-a-0061 202.184000 206.147625 uh i know the newspaper used to be kind of the only source for news
sw2888A-ms98-a-0062 206.147625 214.326500 and now it's it's kind of your final choice you watch first you go to CNN then you go to radio or something like that i think it
sw2888A-ms98-a-0063 214.326500 216.784625 yeah yeah
sw2888A-ms98-a-0064 216.784625 219.318125 yeah so much for my effort
sw2888A-ms98-a-0065 219.318125 221.261875 yeah yeah
sw2888A-ms98-a-0066 221.261875 226.336500 but i think that soon the paper may be kind of the only source again
sw2888A-ms98-a-0067 226.336500 231.706000 i don't well just because i'm i'm thinking that it it's getting so short on radio just you
sw2888A-ms98-a-0068 231.706000 238.398000 you still you have two or three i know in Dallas you can probably get two two all news radio stations
sw2888A-ms98-a-0069 238.398000 245.968250 out of i don't know how many popular radio stations and then on television you have just the news at six and ten 
sw2888A-ms98-a-0070 245.968250 250.009375 and i just i just see that dwindling in in
sw2888A-ms98-a-0071 250.009375 255.615125 [silence]
sw2888A-ms98-a-0072 255.615125 257.318375 true yeah
sw2888A-ms98-a-0073 257.318375 258.407375 [silence]
sw2888A-ms98-a-0074 258.407375 260.675250 true that's true too yeah
sw2888A-ms98-a-0075 260.675250 262.680875 [silence]
sw2888A-ms98-a-0076 262.680875 266.056875 than sit down and take the effort to read the paper
sw2888A-ms98-a-0077 266.056875 268.115875 [silence]
sw2888A-ms98-a-0078 268.115875 273.546625 one thing i like about the paper um as opposed to television is that
sw2888A-ms98-a-0079 273.546625 275.129750 uh
sw2888A-ms98-a-0080 275.129750 277.907000 when i like when i report
sw2888A-ms98-a-0081 277.907000 290.756625 because i'm in television i have to get the basic the main facts and that's it that's all you have time for whereas in the paper i like to read the articles because they get every side every single side and
sw2888A-ms98-a-0082 290.756625 295.340750 and every point they make you know and and it's all there
sw2888A-ms98-a-0083 295.340750 297.008750 [silence]
sw2888A-ms98-a-0084 297.008750 298.166500 uh-huh
sw2888A-ms98-a-0085 298.166500 305.528625 [silence]
sw2888A-ms98-a-0086 305.528625 307.357000 um-hum um-hum
sw2888A-ms98-a-0087 307.357000 308.992250 [silence]
sw2888A-ms98-a-0088 308.992250 309.823875 yeah
sw2888A-ms98-a-0089 309.823875 310.786125 [silence]
sw2888A-ms98-a-0090 310.786125 311.787875 yeah
sw2888A-ms98-a-0091 311.787875 312.836875 [silence]
sw2888A-ms98-a-0092 312.836875 317.460375 yeah because_1 that's what we do i mean it's like ea[ch]- each story is thirty seconds
sw2888A-ms98-a-0093 317.460375 323.171750 you know so it's like you really have to tell as much as you can which is not much in that amount of time
sw2888A-ms98-a-0094 323.171750 326.612000 so and it'll probably get shorter and shorter
sw2888A-ms98-a-0095 326.612000 328.780125 as the years go by i think
sw2888A-ms98-a-0096 328.780125 330.994375 [vocalized-noise]
sw2888A-ms98-a-0097 330.994375 335.075000 [silence]
sw2888A-ms98-a-0098 335.075000 336.658625 oh yeah
sw2888A-ms98-a-0099 336.658625 338.805500 [silence]
sw2888A-ms98-a-0100 338.805500 344.544250 i think that is one good thing one great thing about news and that we saw right during the war just now is that
sw2888A-ms98-a-0101 344.544250 352.158000 we got all the information within minutes you know whatever happened we knew about it about the same time that they knew about it
sw2888A-ms98-a-0102 352.158000 357.830125 [silence]
sw2888A-ms98-a-0103 357.830125 359.584750 yeah yeah
sw2888A-ms98-a-0104 359.584750 360.852375 um-hum
sw2888A-ms98-a-0105 360.852375 362.120000 [silence]
sw2888A-ms98-a-0106 362.120000 363.188500 yeah
sw2888A-ms98-a-0107 363.188500 372.997375 because_1 even though we do get the story right away they were censored as to what they could tell us so all we had to sit here and and ask is well what aren't they telling us
sw2888A-ms98-a-0108 372.997375 377.690375 you know so that that was pretty scary but we i talked to one woman and
sw2888A-ms98-a-0109 377.690375 388.113125 she said that she didn't want to know what was going on because if she had a son over in Saudi Arabia she wouldn't want to know you know that they're bombing or or this and that's going on
sw2888A-ms98-a-0110 388.113125 391.917625 and at the same time i talked to another woman and she
sw2888A-ms98-a-0111 391.917625 395.519625 was so happy to know because she lived through Vietnam
sw2888A-ms98-a-0112 395.519625 400.754125 and she didn't know what was happening at that time and she was so happy to get the information
sw2888A-ms98-a-0113 400.754125 402.249125 you know so it's just
sw2888A-ms98-a-0114 402.249125 404.487875 a lot of different opinions on that
sw2888A-ms98-a-0115 404.487875 411.045875 well um-hum 
sw2888A-ms98-a-0116 411.045875 412.213125 yeah
sw2888A-ms98-a-0117 412.213125 415.863375 [silence]
sw2888A-ms98-a-0118 415.863375 417.699625 yeah
sw2888A-ms98-a-0119 417.699625 419.167250 [silence]
sw2888A-ms98-a-0120 419.167250 421.647125 and then too a lot of times
sw2888A-ms98-a-0121 421.647125 428.142625 i think uh especially on television they blow things completely out of proportion it's like
sw2888A-ms98-a-0122 428.142625 439.170000 you know like this Kennedy thing it's just i mean everywhere you turn Kennedy Kennedy Kennedy you know what kind of shoes did he wear on the night and you know it's just like okay this is ridiculous
sw2888A-ms98-a-0123 439.170000 441.610000 so
sw2888A-ms98-a-0124 441.610000 446.432500 but what are you doing something on a computer [laughter-oh] i heard the little clicking
sw2888A-ms98-a-0125 446.432500 449.330125 [silence]
sw2888A-ms98-a-0126 449.330125 450.671750 oh
sw2888A-ms98-a-0127 450.671750 454.827625 okay well it was nice talking to you okay take care bye-bye
sw2888A-ms98-a-0128 454.827625 456.246250 [noise]
