sw2856A-ms98-a-0050 284.415750 294.491875 at stereotypically you know they work fairly long hours but talking with some you know on a one on one basis they say a lot of that is
sw2856A-ms98-a-0051 294.491875 307.070000 you know the physician's own personal choosing if they're really hungry for a lot of money you know they'll work long hours in their private practice i mean sure every physician'll have times when they'll have to you know get out of bed at two in the morning because_1 one of their patients has
sw2856A-ms98-a-0052 307.070000 314.308250 had an emergency but you know if it's possible to be pretty much a a nine to five
sw2856A-ms98-a-0053 314.308250 322.073500 physician or eight to six or wh[atever]- you know whatever you know you can hold fairly regular hours and

sw2856A-ms98-a-0064 349.340125 360.450125 [laughter] yeah i like you said i mean they're they're not really in competition with anyone else you know what i mean like you are
sw2856A-ms98-a-0065 360.450125 372.750625 like your peers you said you have to if they're going to work it you're going to have to work it too but like a physician it seems like you know they can pretty much work whatever they need as their financial requirements fluctuate

sw2856A-ms98-a-0073 415.585125 428.500500 would be affected by the career that you have chosen would you have taken a more uh work for yourself job like maybe i don't know lawyer or whatever the s[tandard]- the standard nine to five job

sw2856A-ms98-a-0078 436.632250 450.636625 see that's yeah that's that's what i'm looking at now is you know because i'm where you were probably twenty years ago or or maybe fifteen just trying to find a career and and find out how much family time i need and then
sw2856A-ms98-a-0079 450.636625 454.050250 s[elect]- select a career that would meet that need i guess

sw2856A-ms98-a-0089 484.899250 495.462125 a foreshadowing of what is going to happen when an infant arrives you know i i mean not to the extent i mean we could always sell the dog and the get out but uh
sw2856A-ms98-a-0090 495.462125 505.155625 spending time and and vet bills and stuff like that that okay yeah we'll get a dog you know well food you know twenty bucks a month or whatever no problem but uh
sw2856A-ms98-a-0091 505.155625 511.966500 [noise] you forget all the little hidden costs that go in with it so i think it's kind of a good experience
