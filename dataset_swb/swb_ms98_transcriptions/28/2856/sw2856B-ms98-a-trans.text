sw2856B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 2.411875 [noise]
sw2856B-ms98-a-0002 2.411875 3.955250 yes we have a
sw2856B-ms98-a-0003 3.955250 6.293875 [silence]
sw2856B-ms98-a-0004 6.293875 18.786000 okay that time is uh hadn't been a whole lot here in the last several months i've been working so many hours when we do have time it tends to be in
sw2856B-ms98-a-0005 18.786000 23.521375 uh discussion kinds of activities although more
sw2856B-ms98-a-0006 23.521375 28.337750 i'm trying to get into doing some sports stuff with my son
sw2856B-ms98-a-0007 28.337750 30.268250 he's nine
sw2856B-ms98-a-0008 30.268250 61.147375 [silence]
sw2856B-ms98-a-0009 61.147375 70.735000 oh yes very much uh my wife and i have tried to come up with a collective amount of time that we think is appropriate
sw2856B-ms98-a-0010 70.735000 83.118625 a[nd]- and then we're just going to have to figure out what uh what time who has what time to spend in what activities i guess is a way of putting it
sw2856B-ms98-a-0011 83.118625 106.708125 [silence]
sw2856B-ms98-a-0012 106.708125 113.554000 i think it needs to be combination of those that there are some things that uh
sw2856B-ms98-a-0013 113.554000 125.404625 i can represent better and there are other things that she can represent better and then that we have to show that interaction certainly and that both of us are are caring and loving
sw2856B-ms98-a-0014 125.404625 168.459000 [silence]
sw2856B-ms98-a-0015 168.459000 178.430875 i think it's certainly different uh w[ell]- i grew up probably earlier than you did and my mom was always home
sw2856B-ms98-a-0016 178.430875 185.293000 uh forever you know she was a housewife when that was the classic meaning of the word
sw2856B-ms98-a-0017 185.293000 186.295625 [silence]
sw2856B-ms98-a-0018 186.295625 196.992500 and uh she was always there uh and i think that because she was always there and i knew that i always had access to her
sw2856B-ms98-a-0019 196.992500 207.985125 i tended to spend my time let's say more efficiently because_1 now i've noticed that whenever i'm home
sw2856B-ms98-a-0020 207.985125 221.253000 my son likes to hang around where i am because i'm here so seldom instead of like now he's burning daylight you know because_1 he's hanging around me instead of being out there playing with the other kids
sw2856B-ms98-a-0021 221.253000 231.953000 a[nd]- and i could always count on my father being home at a set period of time and somehow you know back in those days it seemed like people didn't work the hours that we do now
sw2856B-ms98-a-0022 231.953000 241.551625 [silence]
sw2856B-ms98-a-0023 241.551625 244.753375 i think that uh we're going to find out that
sw2856B-ms98-a-0024 244.753375 246.548875 the uh
sw2856B-ms98-a-0025 246.548875 251.205125 massive amounts of time that we've spent away from our family were not worth it
sw2856B-ms98-a-0026 251.205125 252.654500 [silence]
sw2856B-ms98-a-0027 252.654500 257.317125 but there's just unfortunately i don't see any alternatives
sw2856B-ms98-a-0028 257.317125 262.848125 in order to compete in today's work environment i need to
sw2856B-ms98-a-0029 262.848125 266.422750 meet and exceed what my peers do
sw2856B-ms98-a-0030 266.422750 271.142500 and if they are going to work those kinds of hours then i have to do that
sw2856B-ms98-a-0031 271.142500 317.769125 [silence]
sw2856B-ms98-a-0032 317.769125 319.155375 oh i
sw2856B-ms98-a-0033 319.155375 321.862875 [silence]
sw2856B-ms98-a-0034 321.862875 324.592875 i think that's very realistic
sw2856B-ms98-a-0035 324.592875 328.886875 uh i have a couple of good friends who are physicians
sw2856B-ms98-a-0036 328.886875 340.715375 and they tell me that unless they are in dire need of more money for a brief period of time that they work eight to six and they don't even work five days a week you know they work eight to six four and a half days a week
sw2856B-ms98-a-0037 340.715375 345.637375 [silence]
sw2856B-ms98-a-0038 345.637375 350.024500 yes you know and they're astounded at the hours that i work
sw2856B-ms98-a-0039 350.024500 359.470000 [silence]
sw2856B-ms98-a-0040 359.470000 361.427125 right 
sw2856B-ms98-a-0041 361.427125 372.617000 [silence]
sw2856B-ms98-a-0042 372.617000 387.243000 well that tends to be true of of uh anyone who's in business pretty much for themselves uh you know a lawyer has that same type of of freedom uh i would think an accountant does
sw2856B-ms98-a-0043 387.243000 388.655375 [silence]
sw2856B-ms98-a-0044 388.655375 389.873125 it's just
sw2856B-ms98-a-0045 389.873125 391.008500 [silence]
sw2856B-ms98-a-0046 391.008500 393.535625 when you have to to compete
sw2856B-ms98-a-0047 393.535625 394.728000 [silence]
sw2856B-ms98-a-0048 394.728000 396.625875 then you have to you[r]-
sw2856B-ms98-a-0049 396.625875 398.061875 your uh
sw2856B-ms98-a-0050 398.061875 399.157500 [silence]
sw2856B-ms98-a-0051 399.157500 401.140000 guidelines are set by other people
sw2856B-ms98-a-0052 401.140000 402.723000 [silence]
sw2856B-ms98-a-0053 402.723000 406.754500 but i think we got away from from children a little bit there
sw2856B-ms98-a-0054 406.754500 430.582625 [silence]
sw2856B-ms98-a-0055 430.582625 432.401750 i think so
sw2856B-ms98-a-0056 432.401750 435.467875 but i'd of had to know it twenty years ago
sw2856B-ms98-a-0057 435.467875 453.615625 [silence]
