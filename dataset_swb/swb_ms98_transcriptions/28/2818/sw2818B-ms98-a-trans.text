sw2818B-ms98-a-0004 7.605375 8.636125 [silence]
sw2818B-ms98-a-0005 8.636125 14.244625 and what do they say about finding adequate child care i think that may be the key word
sw2818B-ms98-a-0006 14.244625 30.362375 [silence]
sw2818B-ms98-a-0007 30.362375 31.339625 right
sw2818B-ms98-a-0008 31.339625 52.225375 [silence]
sw2818B-ms98-a-0009 52.225375 56.827750 well we've certainly found that to be true uh indeed we've
sw2818B-ms98-a-0010 56.827750 71.462875 our children are now eleven and nine and we moved away from institutionalized child care if we can call those chain kind of things like that uh by that name
sw2818B-ms98-a-0011 71.462875 82.068375 and found that uh more creative avenues were the right answer for us uh at one point in time we've had au pairs
sw2818B-ms98-a-0012 82.068375 85.352375 by trading services with them_1 [vocalized-noise] 
sw2818B-ms98-a-0013 85.352375 92.999250 then that worked for a while but they were really adequate ones were really tough to find it takes that
sw2818B-ms98-a-0014 92.999250 98.505625 that uh mixture of a very mature college student
sw2818B-ms98-a-0015 98.505625 103.460250 who wants to do something and yet is willing to give the time
sw2818B-ms98-a-0016 103.460250 105.331125 and the interest to the children
sw2818B-ms98-a-0017 105.331125 144.862625 [silence]
sw2818B-ms98-a-0018 144.862625 149.560125 well that's true and that's something that we're struggling with now as
sw2818B-ms98-a-0019 149.560125 159.132500 [silence]
sw2818B-ms98-a-0020 159.132500 160.319750 oh yeah

sw2818B-ms98-a-0024 165.268750 169.523250 other cultures might disagree our lives don't revolve around our children
sw2818B-ms98-a-0025 169.523250 201.875125 [silence]
sw2818B-ms98-a-0026 201.875125 204.494375 well it certainly is uh
sw2818B-ms98-a-0027 204.494375 211.813500 if i can gather the other side of the coin for a moment it is such an honor and a thrill
sw2818B-ms98-a-0028 211.813500 213.549125 to be a parent
sw2818B-ms98-a-0029 213.549125 217.095000 that most of the time it's worth it
sw2818B-ms98-a-0030 217.095000 218.800875 [silence]
sw2818B-ms98-a-0031 218.800875 222.885500 you know i- i just have to be honest about it it's not always worth it
sw2818B-ms98-a-0032 222.885500 229.438375 there are those times when i think jeez if i didn't have children i could be out playing bridge or golf
sw2818B-ms98-a-0033 229.438375 288.121625 [silence]
sw2818B-ms98-a-0034 288.121625 292.319625 well we were lucky when our children were that age and
sw2818B-ms98-a-0035 292.319625 299.879750 li[ving]- having lived in a community for a while and we knew the person to whom we were entrusting our children and
sw2818B-ms98-a-0036 299.879750 304.408000 and and felt that that bond of safety and feeling of safety
sw2818B-ms98-a-0037 304.408000 306.938750 and leaving them with them as small children
sw2818B-ms98-a-0038 306.938750 312.722125 but we also learned something from that experience as our children got older in [laughter-that]
sw2818B-ms98-a-0039 312.722125 316.202750 uh care givers are not
sw2818B-ms98-a-0040 316.202750 322.584250 [omniscious/omniscent] [omniscipotent/omnipotent] they're they are not all things to all people or all children
sw2818B-ms98-a-0041 322.584250 328.406625 the the ones that are good with babies tend not to be good with toddlers [laughter]
