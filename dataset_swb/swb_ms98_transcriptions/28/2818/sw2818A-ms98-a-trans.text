sw2818A-ms98-a-0008 13.176125 21.779250 i think that's correct there i relatively not existent from uh from what i hear from my friends it seems like uh
sw2818A-ms98-a-0009 21.779250 36.494625 even when they have consulted day care centers that are quote unquote reputable that are sort of like a chain if i can use that word uh still you have to deal with the people that you know happen to be operating it locally
sw2818A-ms98-a-0010 36.494625 46.771125 and uh it's just a matter of of trust you know i think they feel that these people are um under qualified basically and underpaid
sw2818A-ms98-a-0011 46.771125 51.941500 and i think that sort of goes hand in hand so it's it's difficult for them

sw2818A-ms98-a-0030 105.054000 118.223875 right i do have a friend that uh uh she and her roommate became live in uh care givers and they they loved it they had stayed with this family from the time
sw2818A-ms98-a-0031 118.223875 125.356375 these children were small you know four or five years old up until they were well into grade school
sw2818A-ms98-a-0032 125.356375 133.891375 and uh she was paid very well because they the parents trusted them and they you know had done such a good job
sw2818A-ms98-a-0033 133.891375 144.200875 so um i can see where someone you know in a position like that in a live in capacity would definitely be the way to go if you're lucky enough to have the finances to be able to do that

sw2818A-ms98-a-0037 151.677875 157.917625 you know a terrible thing to say when your speaking of children in that way but you still have to be realistic as well i think

sw2818A-ms98-a-0044 174.766375 186.209500 you know it's just there's so much pressure when you're talking about uh two people that work outside the home and and i think that's one reason why i continue to be without children i
sw2818A-ms98-a-0045 186.209500 191.423750 it's just such a such a responsibility and and when i've had friends that have said
sw2818A-ms98-a-0046 191.423750 201.458875 when you hear people say it alters your life forever please take heed [laughter-and] [laughter-realize] that that's true so it's uh such a responsibility

sw2818A-ms98-a-0058 231.058625 245.297250 but you know it's it's funny i did i- i had a friend that said you know before we always said we don't want children because we can't go off on the spur of the moment or this or that and the other and she got older she said but you know but we never do those things anyway so 
sw2818A-ms98-a-0059 245.297250 251.336750 why [laughter] why am i waiting you know it's just the it's just the way your attitude changes and you mature i suppose but
sw2818A-ms98-a-0060 251.336750 253.406500 the thing about the child care i
sw2818A-ms98-a-0061 253.406500 266.521375 you know i have friends that [vocalized-noise] struggle financially and and they both do have to work it's a matter of not necessarily uh that she might want to stay home or he as well but you know that they need the money 
sw2818A-ms98-a-0062 266.521375 274.075625 and uh when i seen some of my my friends that have taken that six week old baby you know to someone else and
sw2818A-ms98-a-0063 274.075625 288.197125 it's just i can imagine how emotional it must be and and you know multiplied by the fact that you don't really trust the person or you're uncomfortable with the situation you've been placed in as far as child care goes um it's it's just a scary thing

sw2818A-ms98-a-0082 337.734625 348.027000 you know taking care of a baby i know is not an easy thing but when you have them in their their little feet are moving and you have to chase them down constantly i'm sure that's a whole new ball game

sw2818A-ms98-a-0133 530.924375 545.563125 so uh they just sort of you know adopted me as their eleventh child so that worked out pretty well she never had to worry about uh taking anybody to child care because_1 there was always somebody there older to deal with them so i guess that's that's an alternative you could just
sw2818A-ms98-a-0134 545.563125 553.529750 um have have a whole bunch and by the time the little the youngest ones are are there you'll have old ones to take care of them
sw2818A-ms98-a-0135 553.529750 561.611500 yeah yeah i don't know it just see when you see all these these uh horror stories on television about child care and
