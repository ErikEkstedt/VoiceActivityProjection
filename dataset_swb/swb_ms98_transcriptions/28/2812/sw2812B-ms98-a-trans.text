sw2812B-ms98-a-0012 29.834375 35.928500 i this was my twentieth high school reunion in Chicago and basically um
sw2812B-ms98-a-0013 35.928500 48.784750 the choices i mean you know you probably heard that in the fifties women liked to stay home and all that that's kind of um the opposite of what it was in the sixties and early seventies it was sort of just to um go protest and uh
sw2812B-ms98-a-0014 48.784750 55.244000 just everybody be damned and live with someone and you know social social morals were a little bit lacking

sw2812B-ms98-a-0023 87.747875 101.173500 it did and some of the other stuff that um i think that changed it you uh when i first got out of college fifteen years ago they were always saying well if you if you were assertive you were a libber or you were aggressive not assertive and independent and
sw2812B-ms98-a-0024 101.173500 115.484625 in terms of the corporate community i've seen a big change in terms of men finally being quote unquote used to women who are in uh controlling positions as higher you know corporate in the corporate hierarchy so i think that's good

sw2812B-ms98-a-0038 164.742125 177.465250 a lot of the things um the demographics too i mean there's more i don't have the numbers in my head right now but a lot of the things that brought feminism i mean there are just more women in in in the demographics just generally in the United States in terms of being
sw2812B-ms98-a-0039 177.465250 184.886875 i mean i'm the typical baby boomer i hate that term but in terms of women [laughter] women going out i mean twenty three i remember that
sw2812B-ms98-a-0040 184.886875 193.721625 what's it like to be twenty three as a woman today i mean when i was twenty three the issues were either go to graduate school or get married um those were the general issues

sw2812B-ms98-a-0059 253.749875 265.950625 right and and you'll find that that's the other big thing that has changed in terms of um women don't feel like they need to get married anymore i was twenty seven when i got married and i just at the time um my husband actually even jokes about it
sw2812B-ms98-a-0060 265.950625 277.388875 he was twenty three when we met and i was at a point where it was like i didn't date i mean i just i went out to have a good time but i didn't have to have male companionship um and a lot of the um
sw2812B-ms98-a-0061 277.388875 291.366125 friends that i had in school at that point who had gone back and gone to law school or MBA programs um which i also had done had just you know they were very sad but then by the time i got married um it seemed like they were on their second or third around the marriage track
sw2812B-ms98-a-0062 291.366125 301.281500 so i guess that's a big change in terms of just um the attachments that women feel like they need to have the dependency their self-identity is stronger yeah

sw2812B-ms98-a-0066 309.007625 314.571250 right and i- i- i mean i don't know how how old your mom is she's probably let's see my mother's in her early sixties so
sw2812B-ms98-a-0067 314.571250 326.520000 okay [laughter] i'm thirty eight your mother's fo[rty]- [laughter] i just turned thirty eight um [laughter] yes i'm laughing oh my God it does start to creep up no um but it's okay don't ever let age i mean i don't thi[nk]-
sw2812B-ms98-a-0068 326.520000 329.739125 nobody talks about it for women except other women and other men

sw2812B-ms98-a-0079 356.641625 365.070875 yeah you are because_1 what i was going to say is what you'll find is my background is in journalism and corporate communications and what you'll find is i mean i'm just now
sw2812B-ms98-a-0080 365.070875 377.731250 finally to a point where i mean i don't know why i didn't didn't do it sooner but this is probably typical of the women's movement too the idea that you're going to be forty tomorrow anyway if you want to go back to school i'm seriously considering going back to school for law
sw2812B-ms98-a-0081 377.731250 385.151625 um which is a complete i wouldn't say career change it's it's a [vocalized-noise] but it's still is a different application and i mean if you think about it
sw2812B-ms98-a-0082 385.151625 398.271125 you know i c[an]- i still can have another career i mean i've worked for over fifteen years in what i've done and i mean so when you're saying quick um i think that's probably one thing that your generation coming up after mine is thinking that um
sw2812B-ms98-a-0083 398.271125 407.427625 they have to do everyth[ing]- you know sort of i call kind of i call it a chewing syndrome they have to eat real fast they have they have to rapidity of speech they have to just go through everything
sw2812B-ms98-a-0084 407.427625 421.820125 and you'll find that probably by the time you're twenty eight thirty if you haven't slowed down something will slow you down do you know what i'm saying um because it's just you find out that you're really not um smelling the roses and i know that sounds trite and all that

sw2812B-ms98-a-0104 477.843000 490.307500 it's just individual choices i stopped comparing myself a long time ago to somebody who had um in my family my brother's children i mean he just turned forty his children will be out of high school before he's forty five um
sw2812B-ms98-a-0105 490.307500 500.684375 i mean that's like your mother look how young she is compared to where you are out of school and everything it's just it but what you find is you don't compare the woman because you just get into trouble it's all independent and choices 
sw2812B-ms98-a-0106 500.684375 510.716750 um but what i was going to say about mothers is uh your mother probably just won't say it but i mean my mother and her sisters are always saying uh to my cousins and i my female cousins
