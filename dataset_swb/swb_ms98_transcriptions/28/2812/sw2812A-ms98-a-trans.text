sw2812A-ms98-a-0030 74.579500 88.960000 and i think i think the women's movement kind of brought in individual lives where you had women's movements and you had gay movements and just the smaller groups of people and i think since then is is when a lot of the women's roles were started to change

sw2812A-ms98-a-0039 115.126500 128.032375 i think that uh you know you can just look at home life and see i've been talking a lot of people about education and things and and what what what affects the school system and i think that a big thing that affects it is that the mother is not home anymore
sw2812A-ms98-a-0040 128.032375 136.397750 um like she used to be she used to be kind of kind of a a rock you know in the house yeah and uh since since everyone's 
sw2812A-ms98-a-0041 136.397750 149.149750 going out and working now whether it be because of finances or just the economy uh the mother's not there anymore and the children are i think i think a lot of society is suffering not to say that women shouldn't
sw2812A-ms98-a-0042 149.149750 157.412250 you know go out and do what they want to do but i think that um society's going to really have to get used to it and they're not quite used to it yet and that's i
