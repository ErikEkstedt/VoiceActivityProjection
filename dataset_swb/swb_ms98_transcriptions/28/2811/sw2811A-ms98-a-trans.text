sw2811A-ms98-a-0119 355.369125 360.561875 and i had that car only uh about two years and the engine blew in it
sw2811A-ms98-a-0120 360.561875 373.494250 and so i had to put in a new engine that was that's an experience when you have a two year old car you know and it wasn't in warranty th[en]- i mean it must have like the day after the warranty was expired it must have exploded
sw2811A-ms98-a-0121 373.494250 377.330750 i have no i[dea]- uh V is it V eight i don't i don't know a lot of

sw2811A-ms98-a-0130 409.414500 413.902125 whatever they have in that en[gine]- whatever a kind of engine it is in that car
sw2811A-ms98-a-0131 413.902125 423.935250 yeah yeah yeah maybe it has something to do but i- i know i took good care of it i changed the oil quite often i didn't even do that myself i- i could never do any of this myself

sw2811A-ms98-a-0155 480.158250 492.803125 every summer i mean even though yes Texas is notorious i mean we it's true we have a hundred and eight degree days but you know it uh i had i had trouble with that car after that i don't know if it was just a lemon
sw2811A-ms98-a-0156 492.803125 496.598500 even though it was a brand new engine you know so uh

sw2811A-ms98-a-0158 499.130000 505.250375 yeah course it was a brand new engine supposedly now that's what the dealership told me you know
