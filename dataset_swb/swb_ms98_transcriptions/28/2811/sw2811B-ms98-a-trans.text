sw2811B-ms98-a-0056 132.335250 136.027750 well i got a little car that uh has a certain history to it too
sw2811B-ms98-a-0057 136.027750 139.902500 it's an old seventy one Maverick and i'm not trying to redo the body or anything
sw2811B-ms98-a-0058 139.902500 144.630250 but i've had it to drive back and forth to work now for some i guess nineteen years or so
sw2811B-ms98-a-0059 144.630250 148.859125 and it's got two hundred and one thousand miles on it
sw2811B-ms98-a-0060 148.859125 154.049250 and it's an automatic transmission and it's just a regular old everyday go back and forth to work car
sw2811B-ms98-a-0061 154.049250 162.730875 and uh i uh i guess the interesting history about this is about the only work i do on it myself an the last time i did do some work was i did a brake job on it
sw2811B-ms98-a-0062 162.730875 165.180625 and that cost me fourteen dollars
sw2811B-ms98-a-0063 165.180625 169.710750 by buying the parts at one of the local discount parts houses you know and
sw2811B-ms98-a-0064 169.710750 173.474875 and luckily this time didn't need to have drums turned or anything
sw2811B-ms98-a-0065 173.474875 178.700000 then i was able to do a brake job on there at fairly i think inexpensive price by doing it myself of course
sw2811B-ms98-a-0066 178.700000 181.837125 but another interesting aspect of this car like yours is
sw2811B-ms98-a-0067 181.837125 187.319625 uh it's only had the oil changed about six times since uh seventy five thousand miles
sw2811B-ms98-a-0068 187.319625 190.862750 because i only change the oil every twenty five thousand miles
sw2811B-ms98-a-0069 190.862750 194.651000 i do change oil filters every twelve thousand five hundred though
sw2811B-ms98-a-0070 194.651000 202.760875 but uh other than that it only has the oil changed every twenty five thousand miles and that is a a true statement i just wrote Mobil Oil Corporation a letter as a matter of fact
sw2811B-ms98-a-0071 202.760875 208.671500 two weeks ago thanking them for the uh good durability that Mobil One oil which is what i use in it provides
sw2811B-ms98-a-0072 208.671500 212.314125 [noise] because it does have two hundred and one thousand honest miles
sw2811B-ms98-a-0073 212.314125 221.811625 and it's only had the oil changed those few times and uh it uh performs very nicely it's sh[ifting]- the uh transmission of course i get overhauled on it not overhauled but
sw2811B-ms98-a-0074 221.811625 227.410000 all the uh fluid drained out and new screen and and filters and everything put them in every fifty thousand miles religiously
sw2811B-ms98-a-0075 227.410000 230.995000 so it still shifts just a crisp today as it did when it was brand new
sw2811B-ms98-a-0076 230.995000 234.832125 and the engine still runs just as strong today as it did when it was brand new
sw2811B-ms98-a-0077 234.832125 248.646250 oh yeah the the engine's never had any work done on it all except at ninety five thousand miles i think it was uh we rebuilt the carburetor and a hundred thirty five thousand miles we put a new uh water pump on it no internal work has ever been done on the engine
sw2811B-ms98-a-0078 248.646250 262.817625 it's had uh three starters uh one fuel pump about six eight ten batteries i guess been put in the car and um uh one uh uh um [noise] voltage regulator during all this time
sw2811B-ms98-a-0079 262.817625 268.538625 and that's it nothing else been ever done to it except you know the usual filters and this that and the other that you have to put on a
sw2811B-ms98-a-0080 268.538625 272.025750 and doing that it and the uh radiator on it has been rebuilt [laughter-twice]
sw2811B-ms98-a-0081 272.025750 274.730000 [silence]
sw2811B-ms98-a-0082 274.730000 280.100375 well i bought it from a fellow that i knew uh that worked up here it had sixty nine thousand miles on it at that time
sw2811B-ms98-a-0083 280.100375 288.890000 he always took good care of it and he bought it just to pull a boat with and when it when it got to be old and uh or older i bought it in seventy seven from him it was about six years old
sw2811B-ms98-a-0084 288.890000 300.094625 and uh it had sixty nine thousand miles on it and i had written about synth[etic]- i had read about synthetic oils in Popular Science so i decided hey this is a good car to experiment on it i don't have much money in it you know i only bought it for a thousand dollars
sw2811B-ms98-a-0085 300.094625 309.819125 so i changed it over to uh Mobil One at seventy five thousand miles and i proceeded from then on to never change the oil but every twenty five thousand miles as they say on the can
sw2811B-ms98-a-0086 309.819125 311.290000 and uh but i
sw2811B-ms98-a-0087 311.290000 322.456500 but the oil gets yeah it says that on the can Mobil One cans if you read them_1 says uh uh it it it says as as the automobile manufacturer recommends or twenty five thousand miles what they used to say anyway [noise]
sw2811B-ms98-a-0088 322.456500 328.848875 so i decided this would do as a good experiment and i had read about this these kinds of synthetic oils in um as i said Popular Science
sw2811B-ms98-a-0089 328.848875 338.572125 [noise] but the oil gets so black that uh at every twelve thousand five hundred miles i do pull the oil filter and change out the oil filter and when you do that you have to add a quart
sw2811B-ms98-a-0090 338.572125 343.501125 but this car uses no oil at all between oil changes i mean not a drop
sw2811B-ms98-a-0091 343.501125 344.690000 [silence]
sw2811B-ms98-a-0092 344.690000 346.463375 it's a seventy one Maverick

sw2811B-ms98-a-0103 376.010000 378.512125 well they have V eights they have V sixes and they have

sw2811B-ms98-a-0105 379.870000 381.962750 i guess the V eight
sw2811B-ms98-a-0106 381.962750 383.960875 well that's interesting
sw2811B-ms98-a-0107 383.960875 385.959000 [silence]
sw2811B-ms98-a-0108 385.959000 391.079625 i guess that's uh uh y[ou]- uh you must undoubtedly get all kinds of different uh
sw2811B-ms98-a-0109 391.079625 397.720500 uh engine types or whatever in terms of their durability depending on how they got made but this one here has just lasted and lasted and lasted

sw2811B-ms98-a-0111 401.465125 403.014750 oh really

sw2811B-ms98-a-0115 412.370000 415.438500 it's just a V eight same as what was in your Cougar probably

sw2811B-ms98-a-0117 419.590625 420.918750 you did

sw2811B-ms98-a-0120 424.321875 426.340875 and it still blew up
sw2811B-ms98-a-0121 426.340875 430.518125 you're sure nobody ever sugared your gas tank or anything that got mad at you about something
sw2811B-ms98-a-0122 430.518125 431.793750 [silence]
sw2811B-ms98-a-0123 431.793750 439.623375 because_1 i had a van that uh somebody sugared my gas tank and it it tore that engine up and i had to replace it but if it hadn't been for that then uh
sw2811B-ms98-a-0124 439.623375 441.590000 i would've never had any problems
sw2811B-ms98-a-0125 441.590000 444.750000 [silence]
sw2811B-ms98-a-0126 444.750000 448.680625 all it takes is a cup full of sugar dumped down your gas tank and it will ruin the engine
sw2811B-ms98-a-0127 448.680625 450.026000 [silence]
sw2811B-ms98-a-0128 450.026000 457.057750 it uh freezes up the rings and everything inside so they can't lubricate sugar does it turns to like a a syrupy like crud
sw2811B-ms98-a-0129 457.057750 464.267250 yeah and uh it it freezes everything up it scalds it scalds the bearings in an engine it essentially just freezes it up
sw2811B-ms98-a-0130 464.267250 467.788625 and the only thing to do is take it apart and completely rebuild it from bottom out
sw2811B-ms98-a-0131 467.788625 471.020875 and generally it ruins the engine to the point where you have to replace it
