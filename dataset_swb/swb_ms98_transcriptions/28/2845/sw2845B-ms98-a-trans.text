sw2845B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 10.039750 current events are uh sometimes hard to keep up with there've been several days when i've been busy doing one thing or the other and don't catch the news on the TV or don't get around to a paper
sw2845B-ms98-a-0002 10.039750 16.267625 and uh it's it takes a little bit of time to stay up on things i kind of prefer
sw2845B-ms98-a-0003 16.267625 28.878500 uh if i want to know something about a given topic uh about some some major event that's going on i kind of prefer to go to the public television route uh watch some of the the longer exposes on the given topic it's 
sw2845B-ms98-a-0004 28.878500 31.041250 right right
sw2845B-ms98-a-0005 31.041250 49.756375 [silence]

sw2845B-ms98-a-0007 51.383375 65.161750 that's uh editorials give you uh an insight into people's perspective of of issues better than you know it's really funny to look at somebody and say well i never really thought of it that way how could they think that [laughter-way] you know an [noise]
sw2845B-ms98-a-0008 65.161750 85.084750 [silence]
sw2845B-ms98-a-0009 85.084750 86.421125 right
sw2845B-ms98-a-0010 86.421125 90.622875 [silence]
sw2845B-ms98-a-0011 90.622875 92.055375 um-hum
sw2845B-ms98-a-0012 92.055375 98.162875 [silence]
sw2845B-ms98-a-0013 98.162875 108.764875 right the uh radio has become uh a new tool that i started using lately i'd had it on the local KRLD for a long time but now uh
sw2845B-ms98-a-0014 108.764875 122.704625 with uh CNN a station broadcasting CNN's headline news just the audio portion of it it's a good little clip in the morning i can catch ten fifteen minutes of that to cover it covers the morning real well
sw2845B-ms98-a-0015 122.704625 131.569375 [silence]
sw2845B-ms98-a-0016 131.569375 141.956750 yeah i i keep one in most every room and i end up uh the mornings in the bathroom during the shower and the like i can pretty well cover that twenty minute segment that CNN does in the morning
sw2845B-ms98-a-0017 141.956750 147.096000 and they if you leave out the sports you can really get everything in about ten minutes
sw2845B-ms98-a-0018 147.096000 157.557125 and they cover uh most of the nations events especially during the war time as it was going on they keep me up to date on how my brother-in-law was doing over there and
sw2845B-ms98-a-0019 157.557125 163.994125 and it was nice to hear the the what plane had and hadn't crashed because he was flying them_1 and
sw2845B-ms98-a-0020 163.994125 176.531000 uh the bias though that i find uh kind of another topic the the bias that i find in some of the coverages it's kind of hard on oh let's say it's a major issues to get uh an unbiased opinion
sw2845B-ms98-a-0021 176.531000 191.212000 uh you just happen to have a type of person that gravitates toward that that profession then you end up with a hierarchy in that profession that won't promote someone with a a uh different point of view so
sw2845B-ms98-a-0022 191.212000 198.619875 [silence]
sw2845B-ms98-a-0023 198.619875 199.864000 uh-huh
sw2845B-ms98-a-0024 199.864000 202.563375 [silence]
sw2845B-ms98-a-0025 202.563375 204.072750 right
sw2845B-ms98-a-0026 204.072750 211.853750 [silence]
sw2845B-ms98-a-0027 211.853750 220.313625 yeah that's nice to have anything that'll show both sides to something and uh try their best to dedicate you know equal space here and there for an issue
sw2845B-ms98-a-0028 220.313625 226.905375 uh but you know the funny thing the history of newspapers uh i was kind of amazed uh not being a real historian buff i
sw2845B-ms98-a-0029 226.905375 234.828875 i listened to a program one time on uh i believe it was Larry King Live was had an old newspaper guy on there and he was saying that uh
sw2845B-ms98-a-0030 234.828875 246.020750 the history of newspapers were to be a hundred percent biased that's all they were were that guys opinion he owned the press and he could say what he wanted and he got politicians in office and he did everything he wanted to
sw2845B-ms98-a-0031 246.020750 252.393500 and people knew it people knew that you know this person put out this kind of print and that's what they said that's what they felt
sw2845B-ms98-a-0032 252.393500 258.963500 uh and then they slowly y[ou]- you know out of public cry changed a little bit toward being a little more unbiased
sw2845B-ms98-a-0033 258.963500 270.218625 but that their origin was uh a hundred percent you know i want to present this view and that's what the newspaper did along with a few other tidbits of obituaries and pure factual things
sw2845B-ms98-a-0034 270.218625 278.488500 but the majority of comment was sh[eerly]- sheerly editorial and and had bold faced lies in print just to get the point across [laughter-you] [laughter-know]
sw2845B-ms98-a-0035 278.488500 285.708750 and uh he was he was giving the history of several politicians that were ma[de]- made and broken by that uh process there
sw2845B-ms98-a-0036 285.708750 287.319750 and i i-
sw2845B-ms98-a-0037 287.319750 288.608875 [silence]
sw2845B-ms98-a-0038 288.608875 295.056375 yeah yeah that uh that that kind of power wa[s]- was was at one time flourishing in this country
sw2845B-ms98-a-0039 295.056375 304.030625 [silence]
sw2845B-ms98-a-0040 304.030625 310.924125 yes yes there's still a lot of people that believe if it's in print it's gospel [laughter]
sw2845B-ms98-a-0041 310.924125 312.503750 but uh
sw2845B-ms98-a-0042 312.503750 319.178000 yeah it is it's kind of uh T[V]- they mentioned TV radio and newspaper as just uh
sw2845B-ms98-a-0043 319.178000 328.034750 uh and then friends and the like i still get a little bit of my information from magazines uh especially if it's a technical nature and professional nature as it were
sw2845B-ms98-a-0044 328.034750 335.402375 uh if you're going to catch up on what the latest developments are mechanical design wise or car wise or anything like that
sw2845B-ms98-a-0045 335.402375 337.658125 [silence]
sw2845B-ms98-a-0046 337.658125 345.044875 and i guess the housekeeping realm still gets its main articles from the Good Housekeeping style magazines
sw2845B-ms98-a-0047 345.044875 346.771250 so
sw2845B-ms98-a-0048 346.771250 353.451250 especially as fast as they can print these things these days some of my stuff comes every two weeks and then it's a lot of material
sw2845B-ms98-a-0049 353.451250 355.650375 [silence]
sw2845B-ms98-a-0050 355.650375 357.305875 yes that's true
sw2845B-ms98-a-0051 357.305875 385.226750 [silence]
