sw2863A-ms98-a-0002 0.819750 6.311250 [noise] okay obviously the team that i support would be the Cowboys um
sw2863A-ms98-a-0003 6.311250 15.315375 i say that i support them there's been just so much that's happened to that team since they got rid of Tom Landry that was just like you know blasphemy around here [laughter]
sw2863A-ms98-a-0004 15.315375 16.670375 so
sw2863A-ms98-a-0005 16.670375 18.259500 yeah
sw2863A-ms98-a-0006 18.259500 20.350250 oh yeah
sw2863A-ms98-a-0007 20.350250 34.114625 i know i know i don't think i'll ever forget when one of my friends called me and said you're not going to believe this because i had not heard it you know and they said they have fired Tom Landry it's like [noise] you know what slander how could they do such a thing [noise]
sw2863A-ms98-a-0008 34.114625 46.002500 so uh ever you know since that i used to be such a an avid fan you know it was ridiculous but now quite honestly i i think that i support the Oilers as much as anybody
sw2863A-ms98-a-0009 46.002500 52.163625 you know just because it is a Texas team but i cannot stand Jimmy Johnson or [laughter-Jerry] [laughter-Jones]

sw2863A-ms98-a-0037 124.308500 137.492375 yeah it's it's you know it aggravates me no end when you're talking about a really close game and then they do something stupid like start a fight or you know they have they have something like that called and then that is aggravating yeah

sw2863A-ms98-a-0059 186.888375 199.287000 oh yeah you know it was just like you were so spoiled it was such a novelty if they lost a game you know and they could lose one game out of you know the whole season and people would just be completely up in arms
sw2863A-ms98-a-0060 199.287000 209.593625 and i really you know as far as future of the Cowboys i really hate to say it but i think they're going to end up being a contender within the next couple of years i really feel like that will
sw2863A-ms98-a-0061 209.593625 210.596875 [silence]
sw2863A-ms98-a-0062 210.596875 212.024125 yeah
sw2863A-ms98-a-0063 212.024125 215.405750 yeah yeah and
sw2863A-ms98-a-0064 215.405750 217.523500 yeah
sw2863A-ms98-a-0065 217.523500 225.369500 right i think and it's a sad thing to say but i think it really depends on how much money i[t]- you know m[oney]- it always comes back to money everything does
sw2863A-ms98-a-0066 225.369500 237.432750 but if uh Jerry Jones continues to pay these guys what you know they say they're paying them i don't know you know i think it depends on you end up you know the best players will come there if they're going to be paid the most so
sw2863A-ms98-a-0067 237.432750 245.183750 uh you know i don't know it's interesting we'll just have to see but it's just very very difficult for me to to support them it's
sw2863A-ms98-a-0068 245.183750 252.481875 you know a lot of the guys i really like you know and and uh i loved Herschel Walker that just blew me away when they traded him
sw2863A-ms98-a-0069 252.481875 261.263250 you talk[ing]- you were talking about somebody that was really involved in the community and did a lot of things for for kids and stuff like that he was extremely involved in that in that aspect
sw2863A-ms98-a-0070 261.263250 275.092875 and i think that's why i i liked him so well but uh i don't know you know when i i watch it and then i start sort of seeing myself enjoying it i'm like you're just you're just doing this for the players you know don't think about Jerry Jones or Jimmy Johnson either one but
sw2863A-ms98-a-0071 275.092875 289.516875 you know it'd just be so aggravating when they did win and then uh Jerry Jones would come out of the uh you know the press box i mean i would just go uh you know wild it's like it ruined the whole game for me because i had to look at him you know
sw2863A-ms98-a-0072 289.516875 297.935625 yeah he's the owner uh-huh and he and uh Jimmy Johnson went to uh college together they played football together in college
sw2863A-ms98-a-0073 297.935625 308.567750 and so they're like this is just like the buddy system you know and they're of course they're not from Texas so that riled everybody up you know [laughter] this is like Arkansas people
sw2863A-ms98-a-0074 308.567750 314.894125 so uh that didn't go over well so we'll see as i said i really think that they'll eventually
sw2863A-ms98-a-0075 314.894125 317.721125 they'll eventually be a contender so
sw2863A-ms98-a-0076 317.721125 322.497625 [silence]
sw2863A-ms98-a-0077 322.497625 324.691375 yeah yeah it's

sw2863A-ms98-a-0079 328.782500 340.370750 no i haven't uh you know i find myself it's just it seems like it's so hard to uh i don't know why it is but it's just so hard for me to get involved in it you know i love football
sw2863A-ms98-a-0080 340.370750 349.007750 but it you know i feel like i'm not watching the NFL for some reason it's like oh it really doesn't count you know and that's terrible but that's just sort of the way i feel about it
sw2863A-ms98-a-0081 349.007750 351.556625 [silence]

sw2863A-ms98-a-0089 365.590000 375.236750 yeah yeah i mean you know you see you can definitely get involved in it more when it's somebody that you've supported all along and it's someone local because you've got all the press you know
sw2863A-ms98-a-0090 375.236750 380.782625 you read more about them of course and and hear more about them on on television and and such but
sw2863A-ms98-a-0091 380.782625 391.771875 uh i you know as much as i love it i would think that i would sit down and watch it but it just as i said for some reason it's like oh they you know they're just out there playing around they don't uh
sw2863A-ms98-a-0092 391.771875 394.336625 they don't really they don't really count
sw2863A-ms98-a-0093 394.336625 396.086875 [silence]
sw2863A-ms98-a-0094 396.086875 402.221375 uh for Dallas uh my mind went blank i can picture his face

sw2863A-ms98-a-0098 411.298750 421.660875 oh well it'll come to me as soon as we hang up i can't i cannot think of his name he's been injured they've done he's had several surgeries he's a young like a young kid i mean you know he's
sw2863A-ms98-a-0099 421.660875 434.353750 i don't know if he's even twenty five yet i don't think but uh he uh he's had as i said several surgeries on his hand and and uh he's making a fortune of course he didn't play that much
sw2863A-ms98-a-0100 434.353750 439.416625 uh last season he was out for maybe you know four or five games so

sw2863A-ms98-a-0141 560.528875 564.293500 you know as as we were when they were such a great team you know

sw2863A-ms98-a-0146 585.634875 598.778500 and i'm a UT freak too i mean i'm a a University of Texas fan so i followed Earl Campbell over to the Oilers and and uh you know i kept up with that as well and and i was i was just crazy about him so i
