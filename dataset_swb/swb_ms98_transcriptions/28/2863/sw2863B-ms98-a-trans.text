sw2863B-ms98-a-0010 60.269750 63.893500 uh it'll probably come to me but i was thinking of
sw2863B-ms98-a-0011 63.893500 65.507750 [silence]
sw2863B-ms98-a-0012 65.507750 66.508000 the
sw2863B-ms98-a-0013 66.508000 67.515375 [silence]
sw2863B-ms98-a-0014 67.515375 70.045125 yeah well Bum Bum Phillips
sw2863B-ms98-a-0015 70.045125 81.380250 yeah well he's the one that we couldn't believe that they they let go and then we had Jerry Glanville who is guess is now in Atlanta and now we get the guy who was the University of Houston
sw2863B-ms98-a-0016 81.380250 84.931250 head coach for many years it'll come to me in a minute
sw2863B-ms98-a-0017 84.931250 86.125500 [silence]
sw2863B-ms98-a-0018 86.125500 89.172875 so we did pretty well uh
sw2863B-ms98-a-0019 89.172875 91.415625 [silence]
sw2863B-ms98-a-0020 91.415625 92.788000 oh

sw2863B-ms98-a-0022 94.247125 96.918250 [silence]
sw2863B-ms98-a-0023 96.918250 107.741625 well i didn't really hate him or anything but i think the image of the team as a whole just had a real dark image and he he wanted to make these you know the uh
sw2863B-ms98-a-0024 107.741625 117.669750 uh kind of like the Oakland Raiders used to be the real bad team and they were they were mean and we had so many penalties and it gets really you just really get ticked off
sw2863B-ms98-a-0025 117.669750 125.472125 when your team keeps getting these stupid penalties and they don't seem to you know i mean that's just terrible and it
sw2863B-ms98-a-0026 125.472125 135.642875 [silence]
sw2863B-ms98-a-0027 135.642875 145.210000 uh-huh or do something where uh you know it puts the other team in a better advantage and you know just for some stupid things that we probably could have done better so
sw2863B-ms98-a-0028 145.210000 155.899000 i feel like the image of the on the Oilers has really been cleaned up and like last year Warren Moon and and so many of the the guys are doing some good things off the field
sw2863B-ms98-a-0029 155.899000 168.154375 so it seems like though uh it seems like all my teams always you know that i that are local to me wherever i live from when my husband was in college
sw2863B-ms98-a-0030 168.154375 182.289250 you know you just never on a given day they could do anything and then on another day but they the consistency just when it really gets down to the championship or or the really meaningful uh game
sw2863B-ms98-a-0031 182.289250 184.434875 they don't come through
sw2863B-ms98-a-0032 184.434875 188.111500 course now Dallas did great for many years

sw2863B-ms98-a-0037 208.612875 213.514875 think so well see they've been down for a while so it kind of runs in cycles i think
sw2863B-ms98-a-0038 213.514875 218.376500 so you have the teams that stay up on top for several years and then they start
sw2863B-ms98-a-0039 218.376500 260.613250 [silence]
