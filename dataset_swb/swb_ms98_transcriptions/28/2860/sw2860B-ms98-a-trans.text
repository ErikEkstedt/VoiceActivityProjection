sw2860B-ms98-a-0047 201.012500 205.104125 well i think it uh they need you in different ways
sw2860B-ms98-a-0048 205.104125 209.220500 you want to be around for the crisis and things like that and
sw2860B-ms98-a-0049 209.220500 217.277875 but it's not quite so much the hand holding and peanut butter and jelly [laughter-making] [laughter]

sw2860B-ms98-a-0051 219.806750 223.912875 well it loo[k]- w[ell]- the one trend i would say is that
sw2860B-ms98-a-0052 223.912875 238.231000 with so many more women choosing professional careers there are fewer of them home in the afternoons and i don't think it needs to be the mothers but i think it would be nice if some of the parents would be around for a few more hours

sw2860B-ms98-a-0079 361.403000 368.557125 so uh they never played together or anything and there are only two of them_1 and they didn't live in the same town

sw2860B-ms98-a-0101 467.312750 474.034875 that was pinned on the date and then you took it off and put it on the tree so at the end you had a decorated tree

sw2860B-ms98-a-0119 530.399500 537.271000 well you were saying what other trends are there and one just occurred to me because_1 i was editing a book about it recently
sw2860B-ms98-a-0120 537.271000 545.724375 and that is the trend in a lot of uh lower class areas for the grandmothers to be raising the children
sw2860B-ms98-a-0121 545.724375 550.624375 and that's a lot of it is due to the fact that the mothers are on drugs
sw2860B-ms98-a-0122 550.624375 553.992125 and

sw2860B-ms98-a-0127 572.504625 583.907750 matriarchies in a way uh where the tradition in the family has been for a teenaged daughter to have a baby while she's still living at home with the mother
