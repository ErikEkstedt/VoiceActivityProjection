sw2860A-ms98-a-0008 23.052125 34.386125 um my children are um are swimmers and so as they were growing up much of uh our um normal life outside of school and everything arou[nd]- and
sw2860A-ms98-a-0009 34.386125 45.056250 revolved around their swimming so in order to have a reason for being there especially as they got older i became involved in it too so we were always together at their meets
sw2860A-ms98-a-0010 45.056250 47.822750 [silence]

sw2860A-ms98-a-0015 56.734500 64.700875 yeah th[e]- the boys tried those but they r[eally]- they did go in they started swimming when they were oh seven and eight and they really loved it and they're swimming both
sw2860A-ms98-a-0016 64.700875 72.667250 they'll be one is in college also swims in college and the other will continue to swim in college and they're fortunate they may even made nationals
sw2860A-ms98-a-0017 72.667250 83.288250 and so we would drive up to see that when w[e]- whenever it was reasonably close but we did a lot of things um and we tried to do things both together and individually with the children um
sw2860A-ms98-a-0018 83.288250 88.119125 we live near Washington so we we would always go in for the museums
sw2860A-ms98-a-0019 88.119125 101.300375 that's always a big uh thing and one of my children is uh also a musician so um one of the things that we did with him a lot was to go [noise] either my husband or i or both of us would to concerts with him
sw2860A-ms98-a-0020 101.300375 112.994000 and my other child um uh is in big into tropical fish so our whole family we take family trips to different places to visit fish stores or go to fish shows so

sw2860A-ms98-a-0029 139.933375 145.855125 yes in fact it's funny our vacations have always been um uh uh
sw2860A-ms98-a-0030 145.855125 157.835375 uh as as they've gotten older when they were younger we would go to the beach but as they got older we tried to pattern our vacations where we would travel and do things and that there would be a a feature each day
sw2860A-ms98-a-0031 157.835375 170.646375 whether it would be going to one summer we uh we went up to New England and we went to the marble quarries up there and uh uh to see that and another day we fish hatchery and so we did
sw2860A-ms98-a-0032 170.646375 173.586250 you know we did try and of course we learned too
sw2860A-ms98-a-0033 173.586250 179.364375 uh but um and uh i don't know i uh when they were very young i did not work 
sw2860A-ms98-a-0034 179.364375 184.613250 [silence]

sw2860A-ms98-a-0036 185.726750 196.645125 and i- i started working part-time when they were in um junior high school and high school and now and i worked in the school system and now i work a full school day but that leaves me off on holidays and summers
sw2860A-ms98-a-0037 196.645125 202.157250 so it was a it was a you know i think they need me more when they were older [laughter-than] [laughter-they] do when they're
sw2860A-ms98-a-0038 202.157250 204.200000 [silence]
sw2860A-ms98-a-0039 204.200000 206.027125 that's true yes

sw2860A-ms98-a-0043 213.228250 220.356500 um yeah that's that's for sure that's for sure what do you do you have any feelings as to the trends that you see

sw2860A-ms98-a-0047 237.498125 245.748375 yeah when they [vocalized-noise] you know it was funny i can remember and my mother and i have talked about it how important it was when i came home from school
sw2860A-ms98-a-0048 245.748375 250.629875 it wasn't really conversation but there were always things that just tumbled out
sw2860A-ms98-a-0049 250.629875 252.520125 and uh a
sw2860A-ms98-a-0050 252.520125 257.238625 granted the child doesn't always think that they're sharing it but it when they when it's not there they miss it
sw2860A-ms98-a-0051 257.238625 263.154375 [silence]

sw2860A-ms98-a-0054 268.952875 275.303125 yeah yeah no i i i realize that but it's funny they don't always do it but occasionally they do and you want
sw2860A-ms98-a-0055 275.303125 285.754125 and when they do there's a reason for it that they're sharing it and you want to be avail[able]- at least i've wanted to be available when they for some reason they had they were bouncing something off of me
sw2860A-ms98-a-0056 285.754125 292.987125 because it was something that was bothering them or they were concerned about and it was uh you just felt gee if i weren't here
sw2860A-ms98-a-0057 292.987125 294.879375 how or or if my husband
sw2860A-ms98-a-0058 294.879375 296.562750 that's right
sw2860A-ms98-a-0059 296.562750 310.371375 yes that's exactly right uh but it has been um it's been interesting and particularly i i think because the society in which we live families are separated you don't have grandparents near by or aunts and uncles
sw2860A-ms98-a-0060 310.371375 314.946375 um i mean i grew up in a situation where on weekends we were always visiting relatives
sw2860A-ms98-a-0061 314.946375 319.236250 [silence]
sw2860A-ms98-a-0062 319.236250 320.450000 um-hum

sw2860A-ms98-a-0064 325.705500 327.344250 yeah yeah
sw2860A-ms98-a-0065 327.344250 340.224750 see and we're uh that we i i grew up with you know every weekend there was some visiting somewhere um and it was sort of an Italian family um but my children we although we have some relatives in the area that we
sw2860A-ms98-a-0066 340.224750 343.897250 we see we they don't ha[ve]- it's not that constant
sw2860A-ms98-a-0067 343.897250 348.082500 thing where you are on intimate terms with cousins
sw2860A-ms98-a-0068 348.082500 350.373125 [silence]
sw2860A-ms98-a-0069 350.373125 351.500000 um-hum
sw2860A-ms98-a-0070 351.500000 357.622125 [silence]
sw2860A-ms98-a-0071 357.622125 358.543000 yeah
sw2860A-ms98-a-0072 358.543000 360.854625 [silence]
sw2860A-ms98-a-0073 360.854625 362.106625 uh-huh
sw2860A-ms98-a-0074 362.106625 364.603500 [silence]
sw2860A-ms98-a-0075 364.603500 367.409000 yeah and i i just sort of think
sw2860A-ms98-a-0076 367.409000 377.557125 yeah that the trend of of families and time where where parents are spending less time you don't have the families too to take up the gap
sw2860A-ms98-a-0077 377.557125 392.529125 and so the kids in some ways are are are suffering a little bit in that uh the model the role models that get the the the family issues that get discussed and all these i think are very important parts of them growing up so we
sw2860A-ms98-a-0078 392.529125 404.436250 we try to to do it as well as we can we keep in close contact with grandparents and talk over the phone and cousins and aunts and uncles and we do but it's although it's not the same we are
sw2860A-ms98-a-0079 404.436250 410.726375 and that's part of i think teaching too is what a family is like because then h[ow]- how do they pattern their own
sw2860A-ms98-a-0080 410.726375 416.048750 [silence]
sw2860A-ms98-a-0081 416.048750 417.867000 yeah um
sw2860A-ms98-a-0082 417.867000 422.201750 [silence]
sw2860A-ms98-a-0083 422.201750 430.843250 that's yeah well we've always we have a had this tradition um that we always go out before Christmas and cut our own tree 
sw2860A-ms98-a-0084 430.843250 443.571250 and that's always been a little bit of a tradition that we've had now this year it's been was hard with our son now being in college so this was one thing that we um weren't able to do this year but we did that for e[ver]-
sw2860A-ms98-a-0085 443.571250 450.255750 from the time the children were young enough to realize what it was until uh our older son went away to college
sw2860A-ms98-a-0086 450.255750 452.324125 [silence]
sw2860A-ms98-a-0087 452.324125 458.016125 and we have advent calendars still from the time that they came you know to

sw2860A-ms98-a-0095 472.965375 475.328125 o[urs]- ours is uh a friend
sw2860A-ms98-a-0096 475.328125 476.740000 [silence]
sw2860A-ms98-a-0097 476.740000 481.980875 uh a friend of mine from Denmark hand appliqued one for each child
sw2860A-ms98-a-0098 481.980875 489.402875 and i mean they look today as new as they did when they gave them to she gave them to us and there's a ring and you buy a present
sw2860A-ms98-a-0099 489.402875 498.040375 and you wrap the present up and i mean the presents have gone from the days when they were very young to a little box of Band-Aid and an eraser and things
sw2860A-ms98-a-0100 498.040375 507.243750 to today where um sometimes i put a little gift if i see something that's uh occasionally a Christmas tree decoration which they will save for their
sw2860A-ms98-a-0101 507.243750 517.770625 their future to sometimes just money um pieces of candy so i think as they're getting in college i- i just m[y]- for my older boy that was in college i put a dollar bill for each day
sw2860A-ms98-a-0102 517.770625 522.214125 which was the equivalent um well it was the equivalent of a Christmas present
sw2860A-ms98-a-0103 522.214125 528.854500 but it was uh and it was and you know it was fun but that's a tradition and they will those will be passed on to them when they
sw2860A-ms98-a-0104 528.854500 531.567375 when they get married and leave

sw2860A-ms98-a-0110 549.965875 554.617125 the br[oken]- yes and the broken families we um as i said living in an area of Washington DC
sw2860A-ms98-a-0111 554.617125 564.497000 we definitely see this uh and um it's that grandmother figure not only raising her own children but raising um children from the streets too frequently

sw2860A-ms98-a-0117 583.151625 596.634500 yes well this is a this is a sign uh this is in fact uh we've been studying this in our school that um this is one of the symptoms or not the symptoms it's one of the ways that young girls feel that they are maturing it's a rite of passage
sw2860A-ms98-a-0118 596.634500 600.408000 and it they uh the the fact that they're unmarried has nothing to do with
