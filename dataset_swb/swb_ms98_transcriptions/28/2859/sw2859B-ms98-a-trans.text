sw2859B-ms98-a-0116 510.841625 513.222375 yeah
sw2859B-ms98-a-0117 513.222375 523.459875 well no i think it's mainly the offense the defense is better than the offense really the the the uh offensive line is is
sw2859B-ms98-a-0118 523.459875 528.796500 just hasn't been able to keep down the pass rush at all so that Aikman's had time to get rid of the ball
sw2859B-ms98-a-0119 528.796500 538.608250 and he's been and the main reason he's been hurt on occasion it's like most of them_1 the offensive line didn't do it's job he got blindsided or something so
sw2859B-ms98-a-0120 538.608250 546.021750 yeah yeah they found a whole bunch of chips in there that they th[ought]- they thought they had one chip and they uh
