sw2896A-ms98-a-0008 25.166250 27.292375 oh that would be interesting

sw2896A-ms98-a-0010 28.408125 30.294000 uh-huh
sw2896A-ms98-a-0011 30.294000 38.920875 yeah i've never done any of those fancy kinds of paint treatments but [noise] they look very interesting and you get some beautiful effects with them 
sw2896A-ms98-a-0012 38.920875 44.878750 [silence]
sw2896A-ms98-a-0013 44.878750 57.672000 yes yeah i've seen that done where there's uh oh i saw one that was uh kind of an ecru undercoat and then it had a little bit darker sort of peachy color 
sw2896A-ms98-a-0014 57.672000 67.679750 and in between there was a sort of a rust uh put on very sparingly and it gave the impression of very old weathered stucco
sw2896A-ms98-a-0015 67.679750 72.893500 [silence]
sw2896A-ms98-a-0016 72.893500 74.160125 uh-huh

sw2896A-ms98-a-0020 86.887625 97.468250 [silence]
sw2896A-ms98-a-0021 97.468250 99.318625 well uh
sw2896A-ms98-a-0022 99.318625 107.006000 yeah i was about to say you ought to experiment on at least a small part of it before you just tackle the whole [laughter-thing] 
sw2896A-ms98-a-0023 107.006000 113.228000 because you might find that it's beyond uh what you're willing to put into it
sw2896A-ms98-a-0024 113.228000 127.659375 eh although i think it could turn out really nice i haven't ever done fancy painting but i sure did my share of just regular painting uh i've painted several houses inside no i 
sw2896A-ms98-a-0025 127.659375 129.360375 never painted the outside
sw2896A-ms98-a-0026 129.360375 131.445625 [silence]
sw2896A-ms98-a-0027 131.445625 140.130250 well uh we used a latex uh wall paint and then a semigloss enamel for the woodwork and my job was mostly the woodwork
sw2896A-ms98-a-0028 140.130250 150.871375 my husband would paint the walls and ceilings with the rollers and i got to do all of the masking tape and then all of the little fine uh trim work
sw2896A-ms98-a-0029 150.871375 158.408750 where i'd use a small brush and uh try to keep the paint from dripping on the windows and things like that [laughter]
sw2896A-ms98-a-0030 158.408750 167.343250 [silence]
sw2896A-ms98-a-0031 167.343250 168.615500 uh-huh
sw2896A-ms98-a-0032 168.615500 172.623875 [silence]
sw2896A-ms98-a-0033 172.623875 177.625750 well i was going to ask if you planned to paint over it or try to strip it
sw2896A-ms98-a-0034 177.625750 179.058000 [silence]
sw2896A-ms98-a-0035 179.058000 186.820375 i have heard that they've got these steamers you can rent now which make it much easier to get wallpaper off uh
sw2896A-ms98-a-0036 186.820375 200.416375 i tried to get wallpaper off once twenty years ago oh with a just a scraper and wet sponge and it took forever i would not recommend that method
sw2896A-ms98-a-0037 200.416375 202.212250 uh if
sw2896A-ms98-a-0038 202.212250 203.942500 [silence]
sw2896A-ms98-a-0039 203.942500 213.130375 if you can rent a steamer if it's modern wallpaper it should come off without too much trouble If it's really old you don't know what it's put on with
sw2896A-ms98-a-0040 213.130375 218.416750 [silence]
sw2896A-ms98-a-0041 218.416750 219.810875 yeah
sw2896A-ms98-a-0042 219.810875 224.465250 [silence]
sw2896A-ms98-a-0043 224.465250 225.820375 uh-huh
sw2896A-ms98-a-0044 225.820375 227.609375 [silence]
sw2896A-ms98-a-0045 227.609375 235.102250 could be yeah um if it's vinyl it should be easier to strip too if it's paper it will probably shred
sw2896A-ms98-a-0046 235.102250 242.670125 [silence]
sw2896A-ms98-a-0047 242.670125 244.730625 um uh-huh
sw2896A-ms98-a-0048 244.730625 246.431000 [laughter]
sw2896A-ms98-a-0049 246.431000 255.270250 [laughter-well] the wallpaper that i was trying to remove was black th[is]- this was in a bathroom too
sw2896A-ms98-a-0050 255.270250 267.540500 and the the tiles were sort of a mottled grey and had a little trim strip of maroon and white and the the wallpaper in that bathroom had a black background and then it had
sw2896A-ms98-a-0051 267.540500 271.175875 vivid uh almost neon colors
sw2896A-ms98-a-0052 271.175875 284.845125 of hot pink and turquoise and lime green and silver and uh a little bit of yellow that looked like coral sands and sea horses and things like that [laughter]
sw2896A-ms98-a-0053 284.845125 293.903000 oh it was awful it was absolutely hideous and and we had a dinner party before we started renovating it and a
sw2896A-ms98-a-0054 293.903000 306.191125 a guest went in there and he said it's a good thing i went to the bathroom before [laughter-dinner] [laughter-because] [laughter-if] [laughter-i] [laughter-had] [laughter-had] [laughter-something] [laughter-to] [laughter-drink] [laughter-and] [laughter-went] [laughter-in] [laughter-there] [laughter-i] [laughter-would] [laughter-think] [laughter-i] [laughter-was] [laughter-having] [laughter-hallucinations]
sw2896A-ms98-a-0055 306.191125 325.885625 [laughter]
sw2896A-ms98-a-0056 325.885625 327.580375 um-hum
sw2896A-ms98-a-0057 327.580375 335.150375 [silence]
sw2896A-ms98-a-0058 335.150375 336.917625 um-hum
sw2896A-ms98-a-0059 336.917625 342.726875 [silence]
sw2896A-ms98-a-0060 342.726875 350.318250 well i'd say tackle one project first and see how it goes and if you discover you like it then [laughter-you] [laughter-can] [laughter-always] [laughter-upscale]
sw2896A-ms98-a-0061 350.318250 354.347875 [silence]
sw2896A-ms98-a-0062 354.347875 355.755250 sure
sw2896A-ms98-a-0063 355.755250 360.213250 [silence]
sw2896A-ms98-a-0064 360.213250 361.771125 yeah
sw2896A-ms98-a-0065 361.771125 372.671375 well it's not hard to do if you get everything prepared ahead of time because if you uh use drop cloths to cover everything and you use masking tape to
sw2896A-ms98-a-0066 372.671375 383.333625 trim out uh all the parts that you don't want to slop over onto you don't have to be quite as precise about how you do it and it can be done a whole lot faster
sw2896A-ms98-a-0067 383.333625 391.336500 and with rollers and uh modern latex paints you can wash up easily because_1 they're water soluble
sw2896A-ms98-a-0068 391.336500 398.848750 and they dry fast so you really don't have to be disrupted for more than about a weekend if you have some help
sw2896A-ms98-a-0069 398.848750 400.228875 [silence]
sw2896A-ms98-a-0070 400.228875 411.226375 and then if that if you discover the little tricks and tips about you know how you get through corners and how you do trim and uh
sw2896A-ms98-a-0071 411.226375 418.055625 how long to leave the masking tape down because_1 if you leave it too long and it dries it can flake when it
sw2896A-ms98-a-0072 418.055625 426.795125 when pull it up um-hum well not i- if you leave it on for weeks it'll do that if you take it up the next day it should be fine 
sw2896A-ms98-a-0073 426.795125 441.688750 you want it to get dry but not uh just real hard you don't want the gum on the back of the masking tape to get dried too hard that's problem it'll come up a lot easier if you don't wait too long 
sw2896A-ms98-a-0074 441.688750 455.306500 and i've i was told i always used the nice wide masking tape but i've heard from people who tried to get by and skimp on narrow masking tape that it was more trouble than it was worth because_1 it
sw2896A-ms98-a-0075 455.306500 463.676125 uh it rips as you pull it off for one thing and then you end up tediously scraping these tiny little shreds [laughter-of] [laughter-masking] [laughter-tape]
sw2896A-ms98-a-0076 463.676125 474.389625 and the whole point of using it is to save yourself work you can do a little faster painting and much easier clean up if you use the masking tape
sw2896A-ms98-a-0077 474.389625 483.837750 but use use good uh stuff and buy it at a paint store where they have the right brands that will go down and come up easily
sw2896A-ms98-a-0078 483.837750 490.211875 [silence]
sw2896A-ms98-a-0079 490.211875 504.431250 well i wish you very good luck with it and i will tell you that i have retired from the painting business [laughter-the] [laughter-last] [laughter-time] [laughter-i] [laughter-had] [laughter-something] [laughter-done] was my kitchen cabinets and i decided that was too much to tackle i'd hire a professional
sw2896A-ms98-a-0080 504.431250 507.323125 [silence]
sw2896A-ms98-a-0081 507.323125 512.327750 [laughter] well if i were closer i might oh
sw2896A-ms98-a-0082 512.327750 521.608000 well i hope your project turns out great and i really uh think that it's exciting that you're going to try the sponge painting i think that could give it a really
sw2896A-ms98-a-0083 521.608000 522.677875 uh
sw2896A-ms98-a-0084 522.677875 524.048625 [silence]
sw2896A-ms98-a-0085 524.048625 530.665375 well of course that's the other advantage of paint if you don't like it all you do is [laughter-put] [laughter-on] [laughter-another] [laughter-coat]
sw2896A-ms98-a-0086 530.665375 532.013000 [noise]
sw2896A-ms98-a-0087 532.013000 535.821125 i guess we'd better go because_1 our time looks like it's about up
sw2896A-ms98-a-0088 535.821125 536.893625 [silence]
sw2896A-ms98-a-0089 536.893625 539.140000 okay bye-bye
sw2896A-ms98-a-0090 539.140000 540.680000 thank you
