sw2896B-ms98-a-0006 22.548750 25.558625 and i'm thinking about maybe sponge painting them
sw2896B-ms98-a-0007 25.558625 31.033250 either that or maybe rag rolling to give it kind of a country look
sw2896B-ms98-a-0008 31.033250 38.191750 [silence]

sw2896B-ms98-a-0047 225.538625 229.386750 so it may be the original wallpaper [laughter]
