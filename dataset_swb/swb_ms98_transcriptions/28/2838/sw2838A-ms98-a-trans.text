sw2838A-ms98-a-0015 152.008000 159.267250 uh i was going the wrong direction [noise] um because of we had a neighbor child that was killed by another child
sw2838A-ms98-a-0016 159.267250 166.754750 because they had a gun in the house and th[e]- the father kept the bullets in a separate place but the little boy was five years old and was s[o]-
sw2838A-ms98-a-0017 166.754750 174.968875 intelligent enough to [noise] uh he knew where [booth/both] both places were loaded the gun and they were playing cowboys and Indians and he shot the other little boy right between the eyes
sw2838A-ms98-a-0018 174.968875 185.789250 so uh i mean it it destroyed two families uh in just that instant and and i a lot of people say that they need it for protection uh having
sw2838A-ms98-a-0019 185.789250 196.435250 worked at one time in Baltimore or i don't know if you're in a big city are you Dallas yeah that's a big city [laughter] um then you know that uh uh
sw2838A-ms98-a-0020 196.435250 210.490250 if you live anywhere real close that uh the safety is uh some people argue that they need a gun to make sure that they aren't going to get shot because of the incidences of break-ins and you know but uh uh we have never
sw2838A-ms98-a-0021 210.490250 223.788875 had a gun in the house with my children growing up uh i um uh once uh uh knew a fellow that had had been a policeman and he said that if you pull a gun on a robber
sw2838A-ms98-a-0022 223.788875 234.339500 he's going to assume that you know how to use it well and he's going to you know try to shoot first uh [laughter-so] you know if he's got one um and if not um
sw2838A-ms98-a-0023 234.339500 247.304500 then usually they uh if he's got a knife or whatever they could throw it at you [laughter] i mean you know they he he said that it it's better not to have especially myself now i'm a widow and uh i so i'm
sw2838A-ms98-a-0024 247.304500 260.977750 uh when my handicapped son is is not at home i'm by myself but uh there's i still won't have a gun in the house because he said it's it's really [noise] um playing Russian Roulette if you do [laughter] uh

sw2838A-ms98-a-0040 332.327875 340.767500 [noise] well the yeah that's how i feel too i know well e[ven]- even here where i work uh we have uh a gun club and of course those people are very avid
sw2838A-ms98-a-0041 340.767500 351.743375 they you know they say there should be no ban that it's not but i can't see why any uh o[n]- on the street citizen should be ab[le]- allow[ed]- to be allowed to have a machine gun
sw2838A-ms98-a-0042 351.743375 362.488000 uh you know when you were talking about maybe what kind of guns it would be hard to decide but there are a few guns that uh just are not uh sport or
sw2838A-ms98-a-0043 362.488000 376.876750 i mean i don't know too many people that use a machine gun to go sport hunting either [laughter] so um uh i i think they should have at least some control over over those things um wh[en]- and when you were speaking about [noise] they can check up
sw2838A-ms98-a-0044 376.876750 391.368000 you know on credit cards well i i understand about the privacy act and everything [noise] but why can't they check to see if the person who is applying for this gun has had a record or not that to me would not be an unreasonable thing and if they do course
sw2838A-ms98-a-0045 391.368000 400.386000 the argument with the people in the gun club um is that uh well the people that are going to get guns are the ones who are going to steal them_1 anyway
sw2838A-ms98-a-0046 400.386000 404.858500 and so it's not gonna be that they're buying them_1 course some of them_1 do
sw2838A-ms98-a-0047 404.858500 409.484250 so it i[t]- it is a hard question [laughter]
sw2838A-ms98-a-0048 409.484250 412.686250 [silence]
