sw2808A-ms98-a-0005 11.809750 18.520000 in the kind of job or well i think that you probably have a full-time job if you're a college student

sw2808A-ms98-a-0011 32.218375 33.254500 [silence]
sw2808A-ms98-a-0012 33.254500 44.824125 do you have a kind of wardrobe i suppose you do that is suitable for almost all the year or do you change quite a bit during the seasons
sw2808A-ms98-a-0013 44.824125 55.515375 [noise]
sw2808A-ms98-a-0014 55.515375 56.774500 uh-huh

sw2808A-ms98-a-0017 62.845875 65.371500 [silence]
sw2808A-ms98-a-0018 65.371500 66.447500 sure
sw2808A-ms98-a-0019 66.447500 71.491000 [silence]
sw2808A-ms98-a-0020 71.491000 72.820875 yes
sw2808A-ms98-a-0021 72.820875 76.591750 yes um what year are you in college
sw2808A-ms98-a-0022 76.591750 85.592500 okay well uh what i might uh suggest since i have had a working career at the present time i'm not working
sw2808A-ms98-a-0023 85.592500 92.387750 but it was so helpful to me you do plan probably to work when you receive your degree
sw2808A-ms98-a-0024 92.387750 95.739000 yes [laughter] and what are you receiving it in
sw2808A-ms98-a-0025 95.739000 99.736500 finance well my husband is a financial person
sw2808A-ms98-a-0026 99.736500 109.528250 uh but when i worked i tended to uh be confused a lot at first and tr[ied]- i would get things out of the closet and
sw2808A-ms98-a-0027 109.528250 115.797125 oh that wouldn't do and this wouldn't do i just seemed to have more clothes than i could wear
sw2808A-ms98-a-0028 115.797125 118.273625 or that i wanted to wear
sw2808A-ms98-a-0029 118.273625 123.499625 and i went and had that uh Color Me Beautiful thing done
sw2808A-ms98-a-0030 123.499625 124.570375 [noise]
sw2808A-ms98-a-0031 124.570375 132.692875 and uh in fact i did it rea[lly]- that part just for fun because i have gotten her book before are you awa[re]- aware of that book
sw2808A-ms98-a-0032 132.692875 133.689375 [noise]
sw2808A-ms98-a-0033 133.689375 140.158625 well it uh tells you what colors really are best on you
sw2808A-ms98-a-0034 140.158625 144.955750 and uh what season you are winter spring you you heard people talk about that
sw2808A-ms98-a-0035 144.955750 147.782625 [silence]
sw2808A-ms98-a-0036 147.782625 153.050250 okay Well i did it uh primarily for clothing because
sw2808A-ms98-a-0037 153.050250 166.492875 um i have dark hair and kind of sallow {reddy} complexion and um those bei[ge]- good looking cashmere beige suits that i wanted so badly were horrible on me
sw2808A-ms98-a-0038 166.492875 174.439250 and so when i got this color test done for clothing i found out that that's probably the worst color i can wear
sw2808A-ms98-a-0039 174.439250 182.392250 so i started buying only those colors that were good for a winter and i'm a winter
sw2808A-ms98-a-0040 182.392250 192.044500 and um so after about uh and and i was working and i added a few things to my wardrobe
sw2808A-ms98-a-0041 192.044500 205.027875 uh in the colors that i out that i already to the colors that i already had that i could wear plus i bought some and do you know it made traveling and working so much more simple
sw2808A-ms98-a-0042 205.027875 213.883250 because and i i did away with all those colors that like the beige blouses i couldn't wear i can wear white but i couldn't wear beige
sw2808A-ms98-a-0043 213.883250 223.673750 so i got rid of all those i mean i hated to get rid of those suits and pantsuits that were a hundred and fif[ty]-
sw2808A-ms98-a-0044 223.673750 231.783625 really but i didn't look people would say have you been feeling well lately when i would wear those beige
sw2808A-ms98-a-0045 231.783625 233.398125 suits
sw2808A-ms98-a-0046 233.398125 243.318750 so it made it so much more simple for me to have everything pretty much in one color family For instance i wear burgundy well
sw2808A-ms98-a-0047 243.318750 254.214250 and uh purple and hot pinks well very often those can be comb[ined]- combined and navy blues and whites
sw2808A-ms98-a-0048 254.214250 264.358500 so when i travel for a week i really would only have to take one pair of shoes a suit several blouses an extra shirt or two
sw2808A-ms98-a-0049 264.358500 267.886375 and it was so much simpler if you will think about that
sw2808A-ms98-a-0050 267.886375 275.024000 [silence]
sw2808A-ms98-a-0051 275.024000 276.427375 uh-huh

sw2808A-ms98-a-0065 303.812500 308.438125 well now when you start have you started interviewing for jobs yet
sw2808A-ms98-a-0066 308.438125 316.319625 um well when you start interviewing for jobs and if you do put in some quite a bit of money in your clothing
sw2808A-ms98-a-0067 316.319625 323.575250 keep that in mind because those those pieces of clothing will do you probably for several years
sw2808A-ms98-a-0068 323.575250 328.972125 [silence]
sw2808A-ms98-a-0069 328.972125 334.248500 yeah uh-huh uh-huh well that's that's very smart

sw2808A-ms98-a-0074 343.143500 351.717500 tell me uh what kind of if you had an interview tomorrow what would you probably wear
sw2808A-ms98-a-0075 351.717500 352.806375 uh-huh
sw2808A-ms98-a-0076 352.806375 364.050500 [silence]
sw2808A-ms98-a-0077 364.050500 366.968500 uh-huh sounds pretty
sw2808A-ms98-a-0078 366.968500 374.260500 well i read an article in the uh Charlotte paper yesterday from one of the fashion experts here
sw2808A-ms98-a-0079 374.260500 377.767000 who said that stockings
sw2808A-ms98-a-0080 377.767000 384.797500 um are also not given enough emphasis uh it choo[se]- we don't choose them
sw2808A-ms98-a-0081 384.797500 390.768500 uh quite so well and it says that suntan really doesn't go with everything [laughter]
sw2808A-ms98-a-0082 390.768500 402.390375 and try to get one of the experts uh where you buy uh nice stockings to tell you the color to wear with outfits 
sw2808A-ms98-a-0083 402.390375 403.471250 [silence]
sw2808A-ms98-a-0084 403.471250 404.625750 uh
sw2808A-ms98-a-0085 404.625750 409.567625 uh in fact she doesn't give white a real high grade
sw2808A-ms98-a-0086 409.567625 413.332125 [silence]
sw2808A-ms98-a-0087 413.332125 415.352375 it's too white isn't it

sw2808A-ms98-a-0092 427.226125 435.358125 [silence]
sw2808A-ms98-a-0093 435.358125 439.801750 well it probably looks good on you then but since it's not very off-white

sw2808A-ms98-a-0095 441.696250 450.374375 well anyway i thought that i- it was the first time i had ever read an article on stockings or or panty hose or whatever you call them these days and
sw2808A-ms98-a-0096 450.374375 452.780625 but it did say that uh
sw2808A-ms98-a-0097 452.780625 459.846000 uh they really pretty much needed to be uh they need to look good with uh
sw2808A-ms98-a-0098 459.846000 465.366875 the skirt and the shoes and you count you think of it as a total outfit 
sw2808A-ms98-a-0099 465.366875 467.237000 [silence]
sw2808A-ms98-a-0100 467.237000 474.526000 but it said also they find that navy skirt and navy stockings and navy shoes are very boring [laughter] 
sw2808A-ms98-a-0101 474.526000 476.173875 [silence]
sw2808A-ms98-a-0102 476.173875 477.343375 uh-huh
