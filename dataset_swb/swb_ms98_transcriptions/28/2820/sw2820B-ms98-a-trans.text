sw2820B-ms98-a-0002 33.765250 43.447000 yeah um i i also haven't thought too much about it uh but i suspect it it it very much depends upon the job
sw2820B-ms98-a-0003 43.447000 46.705625 maybe there are some jobs where i guess it doesn't really
sw2820B-ms98-a-0004 46.705625 52.282375 i mean it['s]- it's if if it's not affecting someone's performance i'm not sure if it's a problem
sw2820B-ms98-a-0005 52.282375 56.782250 if if it's a p[osition]- a a position where it could potentially affect

sw2820B-ms98-a-0012 78.186500 86.477125 right and then if you're a computer operator and uh there's really no big deal i think you know then then then maybe it's not
sw2820B-ms98-a-0013 86.477125 88.245250 necessary

sw2820B-ms98-a-0018 111.305250 122.965500 yeah well i think it it may i mean that in in in that respect i think it may help a lot i think it may be pushing people away from hopefully push people away from drug use if they know that you know well if you use drugs you won't get this job i mean
sw2820B-ms98-a-0019 122.965500 124.514125 [silence]

sw2820B-ms98-a-0024 144.250875 155.962750 i don't know the uh that that would actually be an interesting thing to find out i think i don't i don't actually know how long those things stay in the blood in the system i've heard some you know you so some things supposedly stay for six months some stay for less some stay for longer i mean
sw2820B-ms98-a-0025 155.962750 161.914500 they think LSD i guess stay forever in in in some ways i mean if you get flashbacks for uh
sw2820B-ms98-a-0026 161.914500 163.847875 forever
sw2820B-ms98-a-0027 163.847875 166.417250 i i i guess so
sw2820B-ms98-a-0028 166.417250 168.512000 i mean there must be some
sw2820B-ms98-a-0029 168.512000 174.095625 some something i mean pe[ople]- people who people get these little little flashback things you know
sw2820B-ms98-a-0030 174.095625 176.434375 of some sort so i don't really know

sw2820B-ms98-a-0039 218.327000 220.957750 that's a fine line to draw
sw2820B-ms98-a-0040 220.957750 224.298250 i mean uh that that's really you know do you uh
sw2820B-ms98-a-0041 224.298250 236.201125 do you worry about you know this or that i mean you know wha[t]- wha[t]- what about their rights to privacy well if they're doing something illegal there they have a private you know like especially in in in the case of drinking you know if someone's
sw2820B-ms98-a-0042 236.201125 241.122875 is something more than a social drinker shall we say yet they're not an alcoholic what do you do
sw2820B-ms98-a-0043 241.122875 242.432750 so

sw2820B-ms98-a-0048 263.963750 272.558500 those are to get some shock value out of you or just to see what happens when you get shocked yeah there's uh um i do some i'm a s[tudent]- grad[uate]- student in psych[ology]-
sw2820B-ms98-a-0049 272.558500 275.464750 and we sort of you know figure out um
sw2820B-ms98-a-0050 275.464750 289.994500 [vocalized-noise] i- i know a a little bit uh about that kind of stuff and what they try and do there is they want to sort of get base line measures for you you know how is it that whe[n]- when you see these things and you know and and and they can look at the lines and sort of sort of get an idea
sw2820B-ms98-a-0051 289.994500 299.167625 yeah otherwise they have no idea if you're just sort of jumping around and being fidgety and may[be]- they say that you would sort of it can be shocking and it they want to see how easy it is shock you

sw2820B-ms98-a-0057 312.547250 315.204875 if you have killed your mother [laughter]
sw2820B-ms98-a-0058 315.204875 318.168000 you get a big a big jump there you know
sw2820B-ms98-a-0059 318.168000 326.417125 but yeah it's i think it's their way of seeing how ho[w]- how well you do in a shock situation without worrying about you know stuff like that so
sw2820B-ms98-a-0060 326.417125 327.423625 [silence]

sw2820B-ms98-a-0065 357.653875 365.018125 yeah that's uh you know it it it it could blow things right away for them you know unless they say well look i mean unless they walk it won't
sw2820B-ms98-a-0066 365.018125 374.517500 i'm thinking walk in and say look i did do drugs you know a year ago and i'm off them_1 for a year now and this and that and so if you ta[ke]- if i take i'll be happy to take the test but it will show up positive of course i think
