sw2841A-ms98-a-0024 91.255125 96.175375 that's the one that uh oh i forget the guy's name that stars with Roseanne on TV
sw2841A-ms98-a-0025 96.175375 101.898750 oh what's that yeah Goodman and uh that was funny now that was really a good show
sw2841A-ms98-a-0026 101.898750 113.602500 i mean it wasn't a great show it's just a B movie but it was fun i think uh i think uh you and your wife would enjoy that it's pretty light hearted humor and and and it was uh it was kind of neat kind of cute
sw2841A-ms98-a-0027 113.602500 119.264750 oh it was definitely worth that it it was worth couple of bucks just to get out and watch that and it was upbeat movie and everything else
sw2841A-ms98-a-0028 119.264750 122.861750 and uh you know uh eat the popcorn and all that
sw2841A-ms98-a-0029 122.861750 128.813250 that's where they make the money is on the popcorn anyway they charge ridiculous prices they charge more for the popcorn than they do for the [laughter-movie]

sw2841A-ms98-a-0031 131.444625 138.787375 yeah i think it's called The King or something like that it's it's uh John Goodman i think it's you know and he's the main star in the whole movie
sw2841A-ms98-a-0032 138.787375 142.582125 and it's got a [vocalized-noise] a couple pretty good uh supporting actors
sw2841A-ms98-a-0033 142.582125 146.328000 and uh it's funny it it really is
sw2841A-ms98-a-0034 146.328000 156.367500 uh you know we uh rather enjoyed trying to think of a couple of others that we went to see that we went to see one movie i can't remember the name of it now though but it was uh
sw2841A-ms98-a-0035 156.367500 160.161125 oh what was it i can't remember it's just terrible
sw2841A-ms98-a-0036 160.161125 168.685875 anyway i- i long time back uh uh for the benefit at least of the subject we're discussing i went to see Die Hard Two i guess it was D[ie]- Die Harder
sw2841A-ms98-a-0037 168.685875 174.301000 and that was a scream and you know i thought that was pretty good and um

sw2841A-ms98-a-0060 242.766000 250.360750 and uh i'm trying it's about a it it it's one that was done a long time ago i think Tony Curtis uh uh uh 
sw2841A-ms98-a-0061 250.360750 256.468625 was uh the star in where the guy dies falls overboard or something and comes back as a woman
sw2841A-ms98-a-0062 256.468625 261.028875 and uh there's uh uh a movie coming out uh gosh what's the name of that
sw2841A-ms98-a-0063 261.028875 268.919750 it's already out matter of fact it's been advertised on TV um about a guy that falls ov[er]- he he gets killed somehow or another and he comes back as a woman
sw2841A-ms98-a-0064 268.919750 276.506750 and you talk about funny at least the little snapshot previews that they've shown on TV advertising it are hilarious i mean it is really funny
sw2841A-ms98-a-0065 276.506750 279.601875 and uh so we're going to go see that
sw2841A-ms98-a-0066 279.601875 282.180625 now we saw a movie called Sisters
sw2841A-ms98-a-0067 282.180625 285.551625 what's uh that may have been almost a year ago now i think about it
sw2841A-ms98-a-0068 285.551625 287.317250 that was quite good
sw2841A-ms98-a-0069 287.317250 289.062875 i don't know if you've
sw2841A-ms98-a-0070 289.062875 290.831875 [silence]
sw2841A-ms98-a-0071 290.831875 297.198625 uh let's see i don't remember whether Cheers no i don't think so you mean Christie
sw2841A-ms98-a-0072 297.198625 302.538500 no i don't think she was in this one i k[ind]- was trying to remember exactly who the characters were
sw2841A-ms98-a-0073 302.538500 306.971375 but uh it was a real touching show about three sisters
sw2841A-ms98-a-0074 306.971375 309.151000 [silence]
sw2841A-ms98-a-0075 309.151000 315.854875 no no this this was a real uh uh sort of serious piece it had some light moments but basically it was a serious piece
sw2841A-ms98-a-0076 315.854875 320.411750 i thought it was just called Sisters or something like that or the The Sisters or The Three Sisters or something
sw2841A-ms98-a-0077 320.411750 331.464250 um uh i can't really quite remember and then we saw one uh some time back it's a shame i can't remember the titles of these for the benefit of this conversation although it may not be that the uh necessarily the uh
sw2841A-ms98-a-0078 331.464250 337.197125 intent but nevertheless th[at]- that we saw one here a while back that Dolly Parton and several ladies starred in 
sw2841A-ms98-a-0079 337.197125 341.011125 three or four or five uh three or four women together

sw2841A-ms98-a-0135 522.638375 530.523500 uh because they made so few of them it wasn't really wasn't all that popular and that was uh uh not was it Hogan's Heroes or
sw2841A-ms98-a-0136 530.523500 537.294875 Kelly's Heroes Kelly Heroes name of the show the one that Clint Eastwood stars in and uh and Carroll O'Connor

sw2841A-ms98-a-0138 544.000500 550.497750 but i finally did find an album i had to look around several different dealers here in the uh uh Maryland area
sw2841A-ms98-a-0139 550.497750 558.349500 and put the word out to find the album that had the uh movie score on it that you know they open the show with uh
sw2841A-ms98-a-0140 558.349500 561.087250 uh a movie sc[ore]- with a score to that
sw2841A-ms98-a-0141 561.087250 569.516750 and then they wind up at the end playing a tune that is just one of my favorites i've loved it for years and i'm sitting here as i tell you this trying to think of the name of it
sw2841A-ms98-a-0142 569.516750 573.507000 but uh [noise] it's sung by the Herb Alpert congregation
sw2841A-ms98-a-0143 573.507000 581.873750 uh the uh the uh [vocalized-noise] the opening and the closing score of Kelly Heroes the
