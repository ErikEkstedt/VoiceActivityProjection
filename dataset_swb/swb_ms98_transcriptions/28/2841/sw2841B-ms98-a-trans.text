sw2841B-ms98-a-0054 193.348750 201.094750 like if we would go see a Von Dame movie and he runs around the screen for an hour and half just kicking teeth you know
sw2841B-ms98-a-0055 201.094750 206.806625 he she'd be like no he he couldn't do that you can't beat up ten guys at once with guns and
sw2841B-ms98-a-0056 206.806625 214.112375 yeah so she can't even enjoy it but i think we're working on her a little bit where she just sits back and takes the movie at what it is
sw2841B-ms98-a-0057 214.112375 218.993250 so we've been working uh a couple of friends of myself
sw2841B-ms98-a-0058 218.993250 227.960875 uh we've been you know we'll go to like uh Segal or we haven't went to Segal yet we're going to and Van Damme and like uh Stallone

sw2841B-ms98-a-0075 340.737625 345.957750 with old Shirley MacLaine oh yeah i i don't know the name of it either

sw2841B-ms98-a-0078 354.303375 356.326125 i would suggest that it's
sw2841B-ms98-a-0079 356.326125 357.760000 yes i have
sw2841B-ms98-a-0080 357.760000 359.974625 [silence]
sw2841B-ms98-a-0081 359.974625 366.830625 well i'm uh leaning toward medical professions myself so it had some uh
sw2841B-ms98-a-0082 366.830625 372.016750 you know [vocalized-noise] he was a doctor and it was in a clinical uh
sw2841B-ms98-a-0083 372.016750 377.655625 yeah psychiatric uh clinical setting so it was interesting
sw2841B-ms98-a-0084 377.655625 382.446500 to to say the least from that standpoint because it is a true story
sw2841B-ms98-a-0085 382.446500 383.803375 and
sw2841B-ms98-a-0086 383.803375 385.511250 [silence]

sw2841B-ms98-a-0090 393.098375 394.198250 [silence]
sw2841B-ms98-a-0091 394.198250 397.352750 yeah that he just did an incredible job of acting
sw2841B-ms98-a-0092 397.352750 406.710750 [silence]
sw2841B-ms98-a-0093 406.710750 407.733375 Rain Man

sw2841B-ms98-a-0095 409.799500 414.413875 yeah now that see if you liked that you would
sw2841B-ms98-a-0096 414.413875 418.681500 okay if you liked that um you'd probably
sw2841B-ms98-a-0097 418.681500 423.521625 yeah you would enjoy Awakenings Awakenings is as touching
sw2841B-ms98-a-0098 423.521625 430.986125 but it doesn't have the the language and other things that might detract from the movie
sw2841B-ms98-a-0099 430.986125 435.852750 it's it's really it's a movie that wouldn't mind taking my kids to
sw2841B-ms98-a-0100 435.852750 442.101375 and i mean it's really clean and but it's it doesn't lose any quality i mean
sw2841B-ms98-a-0101 442.101375 449.425250 i think sometimes movies try to spice it up a little bit with things unnecessary uh language or nudity or whatever
sw2841B-ms98-a-0102 449.425250 454.972250 but this one here is Awakenings is very clean that was the only thing i didn't like about uh
sw2841B-ms98-a-0103 454.972250 462.341500 it sure it makes it true to life and everything but uh you know about Rain Man it was language is harsh every now and then
sw2841B-ms98-a-0104 462.341500 465.978000 but yeah it was cool i'd probably seen it three or four times
