sw2887A-ms98-a-0007 35.375625 48.231000 um expect the benefits to take the place of a certain salary level you know they'll say maybe we'll pay you X amount annually but then we you know ten percent to fifteen percent more is are your benefits and if you're like are you married
sw2887A-ms98-a-0008 48.231000 62.799500 um like my husband works and i do so i don't take some of i have certain things that i take and he has other things he takes so i mean in that kind of situation it's really almost redundant you know so that some of the benefits i would rather have um
sw2887A-ms98-a-0009 62.799500 69.616625 i mean yeah more money actually um or flex time or something that was a little more personal you know

sw2887A-ms98-a-0021 108.918375 119.820750 uh-huh that's see that's probably why because_1 Cana[dian]- Canada has the the um government run health care systems social medicine and you don't pay them_1 and if you live there it's like Europe you don't pay a dime

sw2887A-ms98-a-0027 147.765875 154.596000 yeah yeah i don't work at TI my husband works at TI but um i work at EDS but it's like um uh
sw2887A-ms98-a-0028 154.596000 163.307250 you know they're both [bacally/basically] EDS is a little bit better than TI but um and we take my dental m[y]- my dental his medical and the medical is just i mean i think it's terrible
sw2887A-ms98-a-0029 163.307250 175.908250 you know it's eighty twenty but they're then they're getting ready to change it again for Aetna um i don't know i just don't think companies um they want you to feel responsible and don't abuse the medical system and you know
sw2887A-ms98-a-0030 175.908250 184.613750 um TI just did the thing where with the smoking prem[iums]- we don't smoke but did you do you know about the smoking premiums yeah do you guys smoke oh yeah i mean
sw2887A-ms98-a-0031 184.613750 195.702625 but then you know like a lady in my office said she said her husband works for TI too and she said what about the people that are walking around and i hope uh i don't you don't sound like you're in this category but i mean for extremely obese people or something
sw2887A-ms98-a-0032 195.702625 210.211750 the kind of people that can't sit in the airline airplane chair you know you know who's going to croak first the people that smoke or you know seems like an unnecessary penalty yeah i mean i'm not all for smoking at all but i just you know i don't know how they can do it

sw2887A-ms98-a-0037 222.251625 231.666500 i mean i don't know um what other what other type of benefits do they have that i mean Canadian based companies [vocalized-noise] com[panies]- they have to be a little bit different than the American then

sw2887A-ms98-a-0048 248.329750 257.219750 that's kind of nice yeah TI has that but that's a pretty standard thing anymore you know um your husband's company probably matches more than TI though
sw2887A-ms98-a-0049 257.219750 259.140500 oh they do okay but that's
sw2887A-ms98-a-0050 259.140500 261.049750 [silence]
sw2887A-ms98-a-0051 261.049750 262.784250 yeah it is
sw2887A-ms98-a-0052 262.784250 272.912250 that's still pretty good though i mean the fact that your vested that quickly in the pension yeah i know um EDS has eight years i think EDS has seven to to eight years
sw2887A-ms98-a-0053 272.912250 284.442375 so it's like TI in that respect you know and and i mean and i'm working for a company that's making money [laughter] you know EDS has a cash flow problem as they say but u[m]- not EDS TI um
sw2887A-ms98-a-0054 284.442375 295.760375 but i i don't know i think everywhere they just need to uh sit down and hire some uh [vocalized-noise] people the grunts as i call them like [laughter-myself] to tell them yeah i mean
sw2887A-ms98-a-0055 295.760375 306.065375 i don't know but if i were to rank them_1 i guess i would say next to income it's really just health benefits and then um for most people i know it would be day care like TI has no day care
sw2887A-ms98-a-0056 306.065375 310.133625 [silence]
sw2887A-ms98-a-0057 310.133625 311.524500 uh-huh

sw2887A-ms98-a-0059 315.263000 316.647500 uh-huh
sw2887A-ms98-a-0060 316.647500 324.262000 [silence]
sw2887A-ms98-a-0061 324.262000 330.982625 oh i do[n't]- i would think so yeah because_1 my husband yeah they really should because_1 they're big enough um
sw2887A-ms98-a-0062 330.982625 344.753625 and the other thing i think is really good is that EDS is much better than TI at i think right now that that we have day care um they uh the health the h[ealth]- the health program like TI has Texans but it i don't think it that it's
sw2887A-ms98-a-0063 344.753625 348.265000 developed as much as it could be for the size company as TI
sw2887A-ms98-a-0064 348.265000 359.031500 i mean if you ever walked into EDS's health quote unquote health clubs on site [laughter] and you walk into Spring Creek well Spring Creek's better than the one on Dallas Parkway but i mean yeah but
sw2887A-ms98-a-0065 359.031500 360.094375 [silence]
sw2887A-ms98-a-0066 360.094375 369.286750 y[eah]- oh it's really nice yeah you know instead of like six um treadmills you've got like twenty [laughter] and EDS can't even compare in size
sw2887A-ms98-a-0067 369.286750 377.259375 in terms of the number of employees so i so i don't know i guess it's just where they um and like EDS reimburses you for adoption
sw2887A-ms98-a-0068 377.259375 384.739000 and TI doesn't have anything like that you know so i guess i i wish the companies like TI and a lot others were more progressive
sw2887A-ms98-a-0069 384.739000 386.735625 in that respect so
sw2887A-ms98-a-0070 386.735625 390.768000 [silence]
sw2887A-ms98-a-0071 390.768000 397.373500 yeah yeah and there's i mean they have some strange things i mean they have very strange like dress codes and you know
sw2887A-ms98-a-0072 397.373500 407.855000 um you can't wear slacks at the corporate site and that kind of thing unless you're in a you you know but it just doesn't there aren't manufacturing environments because of the type of company it is um
sw2887A-ms98-a-0073 407.855000 415.388500 i don't know i i guess i also wish that uh companies would look more at cost of living increases instead of just merit reviews
sw2887A-ms98-a-0074 415.388500 417.421750 [laughter]
sw2887A-ms98-a-0075 417.421750 422.636500 [silence]

sw2887A-ms98-a-0085 441.048375 455.678875 um-hum and i mean i mean i don't know how you and your husband are too but i mean we have friends that laugh at us and we i clip coupons and i said hey i'll probably do this even if i'm a millionaire which i won't ever be but i mean it's like because you just can't i mean it seems like every time you try to get ahead and take a vacation or something
sw2887A-ms98-a-0086 455.678875 470.092625 well the car insurance is due [laughter] i mean i[t's]- yeah it's kind of i know i don't know what we're going to do [laughter-about] [laughter-it] yeah you want to rob a bank no i didn't say that [laughter] i didn't say that on this line [laughter]
sw2887A-ms98-a-0087 470.092625 479.596625 i don't know what else about corporate benefits i can't think it's probably been too hot today for either of us to um kind of nice to talk to somebody in Dallas usually people are all over the country
sw2887A-ms98-a-0088 479.596625 487.127500 [silence]

sw2887A-ms98-a-0091 492.796000 505.609875 um-hum and that doesn't doesn't make it any better it's just i guess something you have to keep telling yourself you know that um that's what i want that uh you know people are lucky to have jobs and people are lucky to have any kind of benefits
sw2887A-ms98-a-0092 505.609875 515.197375 when you see people that don't have um anything but HMOs or you know i mean really can't even afford to get in a job that costs like we had a guy fixing our air conditioner and he said
sw2887A-ms98-a-0093 515.197375 520.985375 he didn't even make ten dollars an hour and he has three kids and i went oh you know that has to be rough
sw2887A-ms98-a-0094 520.985375 522.590000 um
sw2887A-ms98-a-0095 522.590000 537.171750 but benefits i don't know i guess i guess one thing i'd like to see too and i i don't know how TI is about this but i'd like to see um employees rank and file be able to contribute more to their um the execution of their job
sw2887A-ms98-a-0096 537.171750 543.439750 you know right yeah that's a good word for it um how is TI in that mode

sw2887A-ms98-a-0108 570.243125 582.529500 EDS is oh they're better but they're a little bit too um stiff collared in terms of you know what you want to do they're pretty much put the if that's where the widget goes stick it in the hole you know
sw2887A-ms98-a-0109 582.529500 584.876750 they're kind of formula oriented
sw2887A-ms98-a-0110 584.876750 596.588625 yeah and and you can't really argue with them because_1 they've always been successful so you know what can you tell them [laughter] really well i guess that's what i know about benefits okay [laughter]
sw2887A-ms98-a-0111 596.588625 600.128000 you good talking to you and uh keep cool okay bye-bye
