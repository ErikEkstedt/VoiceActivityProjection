sw2815B-ms98-a-0016 68.617250 74.181250 that's the third part the second part is we now have a
sw2815B-ms98-a-0017 74.181250 84.358625 uh paper type biodegradable real big bag for all the lawn clippings and anything and they've always been encouraging us to not bag our
sw2815B-ms98-a-0018 84.358625 86.085625 uh-huh
sw2815B-ms98-a-0019 86.085625 89.078500 [silence]

sw2815B-ms98-a-0023 93.507000 94.739000 [silence]
sw2815B-ms98-a-0024 94.739000 103.192750 well we have a garden and so we have always you know we'll rake the leaves and then we mow them so they're little chibbles you know
sw2815B-ms98-a-0025 103.192750 116.539875 uh-huh and use them as mulch in the garden or around the yard so you know we've done that for along time and we try not to bag our grass clippings unless its just so long we have to but then we put it back on the garden so i've never worried about that but
sw2815B-ms98-a-0026 116.539875 124.839875 [noise] um but they are doing that now where you cannot put out grass stuff you see when you put out your regular trash
sw2815B-ms98-a-0027 124.839875 135.998000 huh-uh now the third part is and it was supposed to have started in May but something and i don't remember the exact reason from Persian Gulf um
sw2815B-ms98-a-0028 135.998000 150.530125 trickle down fouled that up and so now we're not going to do that until end of June but then they will give us another container that where we will put everything recyclable glass plastic
sw2815B-ms98-a-0029 150.530125 157.678125 uh paper can go now we we [vocalized-noise] bundle that on top of our [noise] and set it out beside our green
sw2815B-ms98-a-0030 157.678125 163.264250 thing full a newspaper but but the other kinds of paper will go
sw2815B-ms98-a-0031 163.264250 170.659375 and like i say did i say glass glass plastic other papers tin aluminum
sw2815B-ms98-a-0032 170.659375 173.484875 and there's something else
sw2815B-ms98-a-0033 173.484875 177.362250 [silence]
sw2815B-ms98-a-0034 177.362250 191.180875 yeah like that too that all comes under plastic and glass i can't think what the other thing is anyway we won't even have to sort it at least that's what they say but the guy will come by and sort it there at the curb
sw2815B-ms98-a-0035 191.180875 192.901000 [silence]
sw2815B-ms98-a-0036 192.901000 194.466000 well
sw2815B-ms98-a-0037 194.466000 201.859750 yes but it will be more profitable in the long run from what i understand because
sw2815B-ms98-a-0038 201.859750 207.173375 [silence]
sw2815B-ms98-a-0039 207.173375 214.150875 they have already they sell all this stuff and see we have recycling centers here in the town that are setup by the city
sw2815B-ms98-a-0040 214.150875 222.857375 and that are you know emptied but you know like it will say on there uh green glass only or aluminum only
sw2815B-ms98-a-0041 222.857375 228.374125 and then somebody comes along and mixes it up doesn't do it right
sw2815B-ms98-a-0042 228.374125 237.002875 its better for them to hire somebody and pay somebody to do it right because if you even put in just say you had this huge
sw2815B-ms98-a-0043 237.002875 247.366375 container of white glass and three or four brown or green glass bottles got in there and got shattered there's no way you can pick all that out
sw2815B-ms98-a-0044 247.366375 252.544000 you see what i'm saying so it you know its useless [laughter]
sw2815B-ms98-a-0045 252.544000 263.231500 that well it's not useless it just can't be sold as clear glass anymore back to the recycle places they say well uh you know look you already you've got and they have percentages you know
sw2815B-ms98-a-0046 263.231500 266.211000 that that what they will accept
