sw2875A-ms98-a-0040 198.554750 205.326750 i do look for a one year old vehicle you know with twenty some odd miles or whatever twenty thousand miles whatever

sw2875A-ms98-a-0045 232.427875 239.201375 that since they don't make them anymore she that could be turned into a classic in in ten fifteen years [vocalized-noise]

sw2875A-ms98-a-0050 271.731875 276.029250 they'll eventually phase them out uh and i sure would like one ever those uh
sw2875A-ms98-a-0051 276.029250 278.971500 uh within the next five years or so

sw2875A-ms98-a-0058 301.733875 314.690875 and i think they're a lot over ra[te]- and their's no styling to them th[at]- you can't tell one Japanese car from the other they all look alike you know i don't mean that as a joke i mean they really all look alike and the adds i don't have any idea what which car it is
sw2875A-ms98-a-0059 314.690875 321.927375 until i look at it to see what it is and i think they have not uh lead the field in styling they do have nice sports cars
sw2875A-ms98-a-0060 321.927375 329.515500 but the price is way more you can get a Cadillac for the same price as you can get a small Japanese car it's ridiculous now

sw2875A-ms98-a-0066 362.981625 366.460500 they were standard Cadillacs but they really looked beautiful
sw2875A-ms98-a-0067 366.460500 377.251500 [silence]
sw2875A-ms98-a-0068 377.251500 387.895000 oh no they have they have convertibles now in the Cadillac field and they have that new uh it's not the big uh Fleetwood the one i want which is the same in the last twenty years
sw2875A-ms98-a-0069 387.895000 396.490500 there's another one that has came out in the last few year it's not the Sevi[lle]- the Seville is totally different no the auto show they had fantastic looking cars so uh

sw2875A-ms98-a-0083 462.344750 473.266250 i think so because they've been making these four cylinder and six cylinder engines for a while and i think that i- i would definitely buy again there's the question are we in the market uh
