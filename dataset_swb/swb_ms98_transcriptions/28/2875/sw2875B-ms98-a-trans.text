sw2875B-ms98-a-0007 24.371250 35.844625 yeah it has really been a lot of fun uh we found some guys that actually you know worked for a Mercedes dealership and uh they also repair them for other the people on their off time
sw2875B-ms98-a-0008 35.844625 47.599750 so have we we have redone that thing from stem to stern i mean inside outside you know we've redone the body repainted it detailed it so you know i really haven't thought
sw2875B-ms98-a-0009 47.599750 53.597875 [laughter] much past that it seems like you know i don't know if i'll ever want another new car again you know

sw2875B-ms98-a-0012 56.963500 68.325000 yeah that's true i i don't know it just seems like uh you know for what we've put into it i feel like that's something that might retain it's value a little bit more than you know yeah yeah
sw2875B-ms98-a-0013 68.325000 69.704875 yeah
sw2875B-ms98-a-0014 69.704875 76.786125 right we the one thing that uh we did decide as it's it's not uh we wanted it to be as authentic as possible but
sw2875B-ms98-a-0015 76.786125 87.565000 we did break down and put a CD player in it [laughter] that's not quite authentic but at any rate that that was one thing that i one of the features that i did want
sw2875B-ms98-a-0016 87.565000 92.456625 i'd passed up on one and put a sunroof in it i had to stop there
sw2875B-ms98-a-0017 92.456625 94.131625 [silence]
sw2875B-ms98-a-0018 94.131625 102.042000 yeah well of course we don't do it ourselves but like i said we were just lucky to find these guys that do it you know they're they just weren't really expensive and
sw2875B-ms98-a-0019 102.042000 111.671500 and uh yeah you know they right and they work on it so the things that can be done here they just come here to our home and and work on it or work on it so 
sw2875B-ms98-a-0020 111.671500 115.977625 yeah it's you know it's really it's really been nice we uh

sw2875B-ms98-a-0026 135.022000 144.601125 and uh i don't know i think it just soured me on it for some reason because i had trouble with it starting the engine [laughter-blew] up in it i had to replace the engine when it was only two years old so 
sw2875B-ms98-a-0027 144.601125 149.093750 you know i i thought what the heck you know we'll try something different so

sw2875B-ms98-a-0035 174.191625 183.047000 you know so uh uh hopefully it'll stay that way i mean you know i'd i'd i would hate to see the American car industry suffering more than it already has
sw2875B-ms98-a-0036 183.047000 187.620625 you know even though right now i'm not driving an American car but uh i think

sw2875B-ms98-a-0046 215.670250 220.371875 and uh she had a SeVille before that that had the odd backs that was sort of
sw2875B-ms98-a-0047 220.371875 229.602375 yeah yeah and she it final just wore out they had they had purchased it i don't can't remember how many years they had that car but she loved the styling of it

sw2875B-ms98-a-0052 238.167125 243.327625 yeah she kept telling herself that and it's sort of a bone of contention between she and my dad because
sw2875B-ms98-a-0053 243.327625 257.554500 my dad said well just let me take it down there and find out what's wrong with it i mean he came back with a new car [laughter] yeah i think he had an ulterior motive he could just see you know dollar signs starting to to flip by as far as repairs went but uh
sw2875B-ms98-a-0054 257.554500 260.813375 they they really are nice cars there there

sw2875B-ms98-a-0135 560.225375 563.760375 you know so you're you're pretty lucky in that respect that

sw2875B-ms98-a-0142 585.067750 598.821625 it's really been so interesting the people you meet because uh my husband Carl has called all over the country you know he's gotten these catalogs try[ing]- it's really more difficult to find these vintage parts than you might think this is for a seventy three
