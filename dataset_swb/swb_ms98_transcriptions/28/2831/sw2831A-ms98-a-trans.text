sw2831A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.126250 [noise]
sw2831A-ms98-a-0002 0.126250 2.913750 well do you think we're paying too much in taxes right now
sw2831A-ms98-a-0003 2.913750 40.434375 [silence]
sw2831A-ms98-a-0004 40.434375 42.287000 yeah
sw2831A-ms98-a-0005 42.287000 50.100000 [silence]
sw2831A-ms98-a-0006 50.100000 59.820000 yeah well i think too many people are not paying enough taxes some are paying too much uh the the middle class but the uh upper class the wealthy people are not paying enough
sw2831A-ms98-a-0007 59.820000 65.974250 i think the le[gislation]- that there ought to be legislation that make makes it more equitable for uh depending on how much you earn
sw2831A-ms98-a-0008 65.974250 72.685000 yeah i sure do uh-huh i we think everybody ought to be paying their fair share there still too many loopholes available to to get by with
sw2831A-ms98-a-0009 72.685000 89.500750 [silence]
sw2831A-ms98-a-0010 89.500750 90.716750 yeah right
sw2831A-ms98-a-0011 90.716750 95.216500 [silence]
sw2831A-ms98-a-0012 95.216500 98.697500 they cut it back on rental property income
sw2831A-ms98-a-0013 98.697500 107.673375 that uh you can't uh get uh tax deductions on uh say a second third fourth house that you own on paying uh taxes on on that
sw2831A-ms98-a-0014 107.673375 109.316375 right
sw2831A-ms98-a-0015 109.316375 113.193000 and they also cut back on things like limited partnerships
sw2831A-ms98-a-0016 113.193000 117.238000 [silence]
sw2831A-ms98-a-0017 117.238000 120.156875 well the maximum tax bracket is twenty eight percent
sw2831A-ms98-a-0018 120.156875 123.245500 so nobody can pay any higher than right
sw2831A-ms98-a-0019 123.245500 128.229875 [silence]
sw2831A-ms98-a-0020 128.229875 131.510250 i think that's right too i agree with that
sw2831A-ms98-a-0021 131.510250 142.582750 [silence]
sw2831A-ms98-a-0022 142.582750 144.551875 sure
sw2831A-ms98-a-0023 144.551875 151.558750 [silence]
sw2831A-ms98-a-0024 151.558750 153.850125 right
sw2831A-ms98-a-0025 153.850125 158.347875 i'm saying the way our taxes are structured right now it does not encourage saving
sw2831A-ms98-a-0026 158.347875 164.882125 [silence]
sw2831A-ms98-a-0027 164.882125 168.277875 um well that that's a good question 
sw2831A-ms98-a-0028 168.277875 170.226625 [silence]
sw2831A-ms98-a-0029 170.226625 174.070375 yeah i agree with that that that's i uh
sw2831A-ms98-a-0030 174.070375 181.849875 yeah i think i wish we would do that i'm in a bracket right now where i cannot take advantage of an IRA getting a tax deduction on it
sw2831A-ms98-a-0031 181.849875 191.615375 i used to be able to do that but uh i can't now and so then there's also the problem now where i've got some contributions that were tax deductible and some that aren't and i have to keep those separate
sw2831A-ms98-a-0032 191.615375 223.513250 [silence]
sw2831A-ms98-a-0033 223.513250 225.571250 yeah
sw2831A-ms98-a-0034 225.571250 235.050375 [silence]
sw2831A-ms98-a-0035 235.050375 240.132875 oh i still do contribute to an IRA even though i can't take advantage of any tax breaks
sw2831A-ms98-a-0036 240.132875 248.439750 [silence]
sw2831A-ms98-a-0037 248.439750 249.746875 sure
sw2831A-ms98-a-0038 249.746875 259.344625 [silence]
sw2831A-ms98-a-0039 259.344625 260.687375 uh-huh
sw2831A-ms98-a-0040 260.687375 271.865375 [silence]
sw2831A-ms98-a-0041 271.865375 281.033375 yeah well i think one of the things that may maybe does en[courage]- encourage uh saving in a small way is that you can't write off taxes on personal spending
sw2831A-ms98-a-0042 281.033375 289.316625 uh that may keep a again that may cause a recession as well though because it keeps people from going going out and charging their credit cards uh to the max
sw2831A-ms98-a-0043 289.316625 294.544125 and it cuts down on uh how much uh spending were their going to uh do for the year
sw2831A-ms98-a-0044 294.544125 299.808375 [silence]
sw2831A-ms98-a-0045 299.808375 311.804125 i'm not so sure about that uh we're still uh in a recession as such and uh it that ta[x]- that cut in the in th[e]- the prime has not encouraged activity in the market yet
sw2831A-ms98-a-0046 311.804125 315.531625 i think people are going to follow the stock market if if it takes off
sw2831A-ms98-a-0047 315.531625 322.938000 uh that's a good indicator that the economy is turning around and people are going to start spending again right now a lot of people are fearful about their jobs
sw2831A-ms98-a-0048 322.938000 329.568250 there are a lot of layoffs uh you know unemployment's way up and uh they're just saving money uh until things get better
sw2831A-ms98-a-0049 329.568250 353.361000 [silence]
sw2831A-ms98-a-0050 353.361000 360.362500 right well you can do that with say a mortgage payment but they charge so many points in order to refinance a lot of people can't afford that
sw2831A-ms98-a-0051 360.362500 371.690000 [silence]
sw2831A-ms98-a-0052 371.690000 380.054750 yeah well that's basically what we're doing right now is uh people a lot of people have eleven percent mortgages and they can get nine percent now but it costs them three points to do that
sw2831A-ms98-a-0053 380.054750 388.769500 three percent of yeah three percent of their mo[rtgage]- mortgage right now or or of the uh principal that's left on their loan is uh a significant chunk of change
sw2831A-ms98-a-0054 388.769500 391.922500 and uh a lot of people aren't aren't in a position to take advantage of that
sw2831A-ms98-a-0055 391.922500 418.679750 [silence]
sw2831A-ms98-a-0056 418.679750 427.945875 yeah well another thing that uh kind of irks me right now is i just got my tax appraisal on my house and it went up ten thousand dollars from last year
sw2831A-ms98-a-0057 427.945875 429.315875 there's
sw2831A-ms98-a-0058 429.315875 432.582375 [silence]
sw2831A-ms98-a-0059 432.582375 434.136625 uh-huh
sw2831A-ms98-a-0060 434.136625 439.316125 [silence]
sw2831A-ms98-a-0061 439.316125 441.248250 right
sw2831A-ms98-a-0062 441.248250 452.189250 [silence]
sw2831A-ms98-a-0063 452.189250 457.707875 real estate values here have dropped at least ten percent over the past uh two years
sw2831A-ms98-a-0064 457.707875 459.306125 [silence]
sw2831A-ms98-a-0065 459.306125 460.659375 right
sw2831A-ms98-a-0066 460.659375 486.459875 [silence]
sw2831A-ms98-a-0067 486.459875 487.711750 right
sw2831A-ms98-a-0068 487.711750 493.163375 there's no justification here for an increase in uh the value of a home
sw2831A-ms98-a-0069 493.163375 497.651500 the property values are still going down and i'm not sure they've hit the bottom yet
sw2831A-ms98-a-0070 497.651500 499.739250 so uh when when they
sw2831A-ms98-a-0071 499.739250 505.308500 yes when they all of a sudden increase with all the layoffs and what not uh real estate prices have not been going up
sw2831A-ms98-a-0072 505.308500 512.937625 uh there's too many too many homes on the market right now too many people are just bailing out on their homes and leaving them their abandoning abandoning their homes
sw2831A-ms98-a-0073 512.937625 517.865875 oh yes there's two homes on my street right now that sure
sw2831A-ms98-a-0074 517.865875 519.665125 [silence]
sw2831A-ms98-a-0075 519.665125 529.264250 that's right there are a lot of banks that are in trouble we've had banks that have been closing for the past two years in Texas we've got a record number of banks that have been go[ne]- all ready gone under
sw2831A-ms98-a-0076 529.264250 531.322125 [silence]
sw2831A-ms98-a-0077 531.322125 536.106750 uh no i don't i think that's mostly with the economy and the job market
sw2831A-ms98-a-0078 536.106750 542.893500 but i think it's unfair that uh the tax appraisal has gone up this year when in fact the uh the value of the homes has not
sw2831A-ms98-a-0079 542.893500 550.841125 [silence]
sw2831A-ms98-a-0080 550.841125 559.950125 yeah i don't know h[ow]- what they use to justify that uh because say i've got the same model home as some of my neighbors and they're all appraised at the same level
sw2831A-ms98-a-0081 559.950125 567.468625 even though i've made more improvements on my house than somebody else has and nobody comes out to take a look and see what you've done to get a proper appraisal
sw2831A-ms98-a-0082 567.468625 578.135250 [silence]
sw2831A-ms98-a-0083 578.135250 579.690750 okay
sw2831A-ms98-a-0084 579.690750 581.580125 [silence]
sw2831A-ms98-a-0085 581.580125 583.180125 uh-huh
