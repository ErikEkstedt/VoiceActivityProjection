sw2831B-ms98-a-0002 2.517500 7.556875 well frankly i think we're paying too little i think we have paid too little since Reagan and them decided to cut it
sw2831B-ms98-a-0003 7.556875 13.994250 uh i used to get these uh surveys from the Republican Party from time to time asking if i thought it was a good idea for them to cut taxes
sw2831B-ms98-a-0004 13.994250 24.437625 and i kept saying no i felt like what we ought to do is cut spending and keep taxes the way they were well granted maybe the only way they could keep the spending to be uh
sw2831B-ms98-a-0005 24.437625 35.680000 that is curtail the spending and cut it was to cut taxes forcing spending to have to be cut but uh i always felt like the Congress uh just ought to shoulder responsibilities of biting the bullet
sw2831B-ms98-a-0006 35.680000 42.280375 uh that they uh uh are are supposed to be able to uh you know handle shoulder
sw2831B-ms98-a-0007 42.280375 50.579875 and uh cut their spending and if they had uh done that without cutting taxes we wouldn't find ourselves in economic quagmire we're in now
sw2831B-ms98-a-0008 50.579875 54.522000 [silence]
sw2831B-ms98-a-0009 54.522000 56.149250 uh-huh

sw2831B-ms98-a-0013 64.268875 66.742125 are you so you like the progressive income tax
sw2831B-ms98-a-0014 66.742125 69.380250 [silence]
sw2831B-ms98-a-0015 69.380250 70.771000 well
sw2831B-ms98-a-0016 70.771000 72.518750 [silence]
sw2831B-ms98-a-0017 72.518750 82.392375 well i i thought they had closed most of the uh loopholes when they came out with this uh pretty well constant fixed tax type uh about the only well i know there are a few you're right about that but
sw2831B-ms98-a-0018 82.392375 90.399625 primarily the only thing that was supposed to be any longer tax deductible was your your first and second home mortgages the interest that is
sw2831B-ms98-a-0019 90.399625 95.820500 and that was about it now i think there are still some real estate oriented type tax hedges
sw2831B-ms98-a-0020 95.820500 97.772500 [silence]
sw2831B-ms98-a-0021 97.772500 99.455875 yeah
sw2831B-ms98-a-0022 99.455875 105.365500 [silence]
sw2831B-ms98-a-0023 105.365500 110.936250 yeah well that's where the rich see uh certainly have a second third fourth and fifth house
sw2831B-ms98-a-0024 110.936250 112.762750 [silence]
sw2831B-ms98-a-0025 112.762750 118.237000 right uh in what way what loopholes then are are left that you're talking about
sw2831B-ms98-a-0026 118.237000 119.483625 [silence]
sw2831B-ms98-a-0027 119.483625 122.484000 right well thirty three if you're in that hump but
sw2831B-ms98-a-0028 122.484000 125.214875 yeah but uh uh
sw2831B-ms98-a-0029 125.214875 129.260750 uh i i felt like they ought to cut the capital gains tax
sw2831B-ms98-a-0030 129.260750 131.148250 [silence]
sw2831B-ms98-a-0031 131.148250 143.692500 because it it fo[r]- for once finally with taxes having been cut it makes the little investor like myself capable if you're able to set aside a little money aside to do a little investing and make a few bucks without getting it all taken away from you
sw2831B-ms98-a-0032 143.692500 148.358375 and you ought to get your salary taxed once and if you're able to save some money to be able to invest in
sw2831B-ms98-a-0033 148.358375 155.156375 stocks and bonds and various things like that then to get it stuck to you again seems just a little bit unfair
sw2831B-ms98-a-0034 155.156375 158.654375 [silence]
sw2831B-ms98-a-0035 158.654375 165.130875 no it really doesn't but on the other hand how how um how would we change it to encourage saving
sw2831B-ms98-a-0036 165.130875 167.117250 [silence]
sw2831B-ms98-a-0037 167.117250 171.581000 and go back to things like tax free IRAs and like that they wound up coming back
sw2831B-ms98-a-0038 171.581000 176.199375 okay yeah i thought that was a good move too that certainly in
sw2831B-ms98-a-0039 176.199375 181.034375 [silence]
sw2831B-ms98-a-0040 181.034375 182.794125 i hear you
sw2831B-ms98-a-0041 182.794125 184.648875 yeah
sw2831B-ms98-a-0042 184.648875 186.213250 and now that
sw2831B-ms98-a-0043 186.213250 190.037750 [silence]
sw2831B-ms98-a-0044 190.037750 191.267125 right
sw2831B-ms98-a-0045 191.267125 193.927125 yeah and that's absolutely unfair i agree
sw2831B-ms98-a-0046 193.927125 201.957000 and it seems like every time Congress and and and uh the presidency gets a set up like the had now see that's the kind of tax cuts i'm for
sw2831B-ms98-a-0047 201.957000 214.628375 not necessarily just a a broad range tax cut on salaries so much but tax cuts where they don't tax savings of various kinds you know savings where you're willing to tie your money up at least some minimum period of time s[ome]- some
sw2831B-ms98-a-0048 214.628375 217.556375 uh minimum number of years and all like like IRAs were
sw2831B-ms98-a-0049 217.556375 225.816125 uh it it that that those are reasonable alternatives that the average person can get in on and not just the rich alone
sw2831B-ms98-a-0050 225.816125 236.753875 but uh uh seems like every time that uh people begin to make a little money at that and a lot of people jumped on IRAs i mean you di[d]- you app[arently]- you apparently did and a lot of people i know did too
sw2831B-ms98-a-0051 236.753875 238.017000 yeah
sw2831B-ms98-a-0052 238.017000 239.669375 [silence]
sw2831B-ms98-a-0053 239.669375 249.436875 yeah well i'm in one too but it seems like as soon as they uh got to going like gangbusters and the Congress saw that big pile of money beginning to form out there they wanted to come in and tax it again
sw2831B-ms98-a-0054 249.436875 253.951375 and and uh that that's only again because they would not
sw2831B-ms98-a-0055 253.951375 259.431625 uh uh police themselves and their spending
sw2831B-ms98-a-0056 259.431625 272.407625 and i i don't know i i don't know what else to do about it i mean seems like we are are are constantly reelecting Republican presidents and Democratic Congresses or Democratic presidents and Republican Congresses and they can't ever seem to get together
sw2831B-ms98-a-0057 272.407625 281.230125 [silence]
sw2831B-ms98-a-0058 281.230125 282.501125 right

sw2831B-ms98-a-0060 293.848875 300.391500 do you think this latest interest cu[t]- rate cut that the Fed just went through is going to uh get people back on the spending
sw2831B-ms98-a-0061 300.391500 303.747750 [silence]
sw2831B-ms98-a-0062 303.747750 305.576875 yeah

sw2831B-ms98-a-0070 322.493000 325.242625 oh yeah i know exactly how you feel
sw2831B-ms98-a-0071 325.242625 326.718375 right
sw2831B-ms98-a-0072 326.718375 329.006125 [silence]
sw2831B-ms98-a-0073 329.006125 335.637500 uh-huh uh-huh i uh was talking to a fellow today and he seemed to think it was going to make a difference but i said hey if a lot of people are all ready borrowed up
sw2831B-ms98-a-0074 335.637500 345.692375 to the hilt i don't care how cut low you cut taxes they can't afford to borrow anymore or they won't just because they want to try to get a handle on what they have tha[t]- you you've got to cut them
sw2831B-ms98-a-0075 345.692375 350.657000 drastically such that the uh idea of refinancing
sw2831B-ms98-a-0076 350.657000 353.951250 at a lower interest rate becomes the thing to do
sw2831B-ms98-a-0077 353.951250 357.325000 [silence]
sw2831B-ms98-a-0078 357.325000 358.618625 yeah
sw2831B-ms98-a-0079 358.618625 359.912375 and
sw2831B-ms98-a-0080 359.912375 372.170750 that's right or or less the break is considerable between the the interest rates and the cut between say eleven percent mortgage down to no more than nine percent mortgage that's not enough you've got to get down to eight maybe even seven and a half
sw2831B-ms98-a-0081 372.170750 375.965125 [silence]
sw2831B-ms98-a-0082 375.965125 377.267875 yeah
sw2831B-ms98-a-0083 377.267875 379.016000 [silence]
sw2831B-ms98-a-0084 379.016000 382.927250 and that's not enough you need a eight percent loan to be able to do that
sw2831B-ms98-a-0085 382.927250 387.986875 [silence]
sw2831B-ms98-a-0086 387.986875 389.493000 that's right
sw2831B-ms98-a-0087 389.493000 391.269500 [silence]
sw2831B-ms98-a-0088 391.269500 399.668000 so i i i'm not so sure myself that uh that cutting interest rates is going to do it or cutting taxes either i just think we've gotten ourselves so
sw2831B-ms98-a-0089 399.668000 404.426125 uh gone through such a uh uh period of time where we've been so credit hungry
sw2831B-ms98-a-0090 404.426125 412.807250 and um we have gotten uh uh so out on a limb in debt not only uh federal debt but consumer debt too
sw2831B-ms98-a-0091 412.807250 419.687000 that uh i'm really concerned whether any kind of taxation one way or the other is going to make a difference
sw2831B-ms98-a-0092 419.687000 424.054750 [silence]
sw2831B-ms98-a-0093 424.054750 425.720625 uh uh-huh
sw2831B-ms98-a-0094 425.720625 427.698875 [silence]
sw2831B-ms98-a-0095 427.698875 433.147125 well you know that's what's happened to me i got my appraisal well we get them up here they give them to you three years out
sw2831B-ms98-a-0096 433.147125 436.508250 i mean you you get one every year but it it it
sw2831B-ms98-a-0097 436.508250 442.936750 puts in at a what they expect it to be for the next three years you know based on what it is right now subject to change of course
sw2831B-ms98-a-0098 442.936750 452.981250 and uh real estate values up here in in the uh uh uh eastern corridor have dropped about two and a half to five percent
sw2831B-ms98-a-0099 452.981250 454.882500 [silence]
sw2831B-ms98-a-0100 454.882500 456.226500 okay
sw2831B-ms98-a-0101 456.226500 462.599750 well see the pressure's is more up here so it hasn't dropped quite as bad because the population being what it is but nevertheless it's dropped
sw2831B-ms98-a-0102 462.599750 472.771750 but uh this hasn't been reflected in my appraisals and i was just telling my wife the other night you know i says i- i wonder who it is you talk to here in the state ab[out]- about protesting this because
sw2831B-ms98-a-0103 472.771750 478.264000 if and only uh interest rates i'm sorry uh proper[ty]- values don't come back up
sw2831B-ms98-a-0104 478.264000 487.383500 which means i can see that i can uh get again at least what i could have gotten for my house a year ago then i'm not being fairly appraised
sw2831B-ms98-a-0105 487.383500 497.304750 [silence]
sw2831B-ms98-a-0106 497.304750 500.182500 um in the Texas area

sw2831B-ms98-a-0113 511.702750 513.879625 is a lot of that going on
sw2831B-ms98-a-0114 513.879625 517.724875 um that's going to put the banks in dire straights
sw2831B-ms98-a-0115 517.724875 520.845250 because the banks don't want the property they want the money
sw2831B-ms98-a-0116 520.845250 525.591625 [silence]

sw2831B-ms98-a-0119 528.119125 532.074500 well do you see where the tax situation could really help that any
sw2831B-ms98-a-0120 532.074500 535.550125 [silence]
sw2831B-ms98-a-0121 535.550125 536.823875 uh-huh

sw2831B-ms98-a-0125 542.528875 550.830375 yeah yeah i think it's absolutely unfair but they've gotten into this mentality and uh i don't think they know how to appraise a house down
sw2831B-ms98-a-0126 550.830375 556.458500 [silence]
sw2831B-ms98-a-0127 556.458500 558.366750 yeah

sw2831B-ms98-a-0131 567.179000 576.312250 now out here they do they take pictures of house and everything and what they do is they look at what your particular model at least three of them have sold for within the last twelve months
sw2831B-ms98-a-0132 576.312250 582.468375 or later if if they have the data they don't always have that much data because they may not have sold that many of your model
sw2831B-ms98-a-0133 582.468375 593.987500 but here they c[ould]- for instance i i've had to they do it randomly more or less but they try to get three at a time over a twelve month period because uh one of the houses i sold i'm in my third house now i uh
sw2831B-ms98-a-0134 593.987500 599.910625 my second house i actually had an appraiser come out and take pictures of it uh that he had to go
