sw2806A-ms98-a-0025 118.215250 123.603625 i- i have to tell you about our most interesting pet though [laughter]
sw2806A-ms98-a-0026 123.603625 130.069125 uh we had an iguana living with us for about uh oh about two years
sw2806A-ms98-a-0027 130.069125 140.516000 two and a half years i guess it was about uh oh three feet long about three feet long it was a beautiful animal name was Clyde
sw2806A-ms98-a-0028 140.516000 146.171750 Clyde the Iguana and uh my son Dan went to uh
sw2806A-ms98-a-0029 146.171750 160.615875 to uh Hawaii for the summer and when he came home uh he didn't bring the iguana with him but for some reason or other he had a thing for them_1 i don't know whether he'd i think there was one in the school uh zoology department you know
sw2806A-ms98-a-0030 160.615875 171.751500 or biology department one or the other anyway uh and anyway he just he went and found this guy in in Dallas somewhere who had picked up one in
sw2806A-ms98-a-0031 171.751500 186.072875 i guess in Te[xas]- in Mexico i don't know where but anyway he brought this home and i looked at him and i said you've got to be kidding i'm not going to live with a lizard [laughter] but you know i visualize that animal racing about
sw2806A-ms98-a-0032 186.072875 200.566375 and you know like you think of lizards doing but they don't do that they're very much like uh well the thing about them_1 is that they hold so still you don't notice that they're there and then they move and about scares you to death sometimes
sw2806A-ms98-a-0033 200.566375 215.427750 no he had full run of the house [laughter] he just loved to sit on the back of my dryer where the h[air]- the heat came up out of the dryer you know it was he was really a neat pet and though i
sw2806A-ms98-a-0034 215.427750 228.174125 you know he'd ri[de]- when we'd have family home evening and everybody would sit in the living room and the fire would be burning he'd walk across my feet sometimes [laughter] and [vocalized-noise] uh uh it was a long time before i could really pet him and 
sw2806A-ms98-a-0035 228.174125 236.975125 but i fed him and he he knew how to get me to feed him he'd come out to the kitchen just kind of look at me till i went and got him something out of the refrigerator
sw2806A-ms98-a-0036 236.975125 238.864500 [silence]
sw2806A-ms98-a-0037 238.864500 250.981500 [laughter] but he was really a neat animal he he'd lay in Dan's lap you know and just uh when he'd pet him he'd just stretch and you know you could see him just enjoying it like a cat does
sw2806A-ms98-a-0038 250.981500 262.740750 it was kind of interesting but he did a lot of interesting things and uh Dan carried him around and he liked to ride on the back of his up on his head you know with his tail wrapped around his arm so he wouldn't fall off and
sw2806A-ms98-a-0039 262.740750 264.556500 and scare everybody to death and
sw2806A-ms98-a-0040 264.556500 266.123250 [laughter]
sw2806A-ms98-a-0041 266.123250 267.491000 kids loved him
sw2806A-ms98-a-0042 267.491000 279.008875 kids just loved him kids just came from all over to come and see Clyde and visit with him and and he tolerated them_1 you know he'd even tolerate him petting though he didn't like them too well at first but
sw2806A-ms98-a-0043 279.008875 282.342625 he he got tame you know so that uh
sw2806A-ms98-a-0044 282.342625 286.134875 people could go in there and Dan was a drummer
sw2806A-ms98-a-0045 286.134875 300.941875 and he didn't he the only thing he didn't like very well was the drumming when Dan would drum he'd sit there and scrunch up you know like he was trying to [laughter-hi[de]-] [laughter-protect] [laughter-himself] and then he'd leave the room [laughter]
sw2806A-ms98-a-0046 300.941875 303.954250 [silence]
sw2806A-ms98-a-0047 303.954250 311.016000 oh yeah they really are they're interesting well they take on human characteristics like
sw2806A-ms98-a-0048 311.016000 324.509625 uh our other animal the next year our our son Ken went to Hawaii and well while Dan was in Hawaii Ken decided he wanted a dog and he and he looked around a long while and he found a Norwegian elkhound
sw2806A-ms98-a-0049 324.509625 331.181625 and he just brought this Norwegian elkhound and home and he was so funny uh
sw2806A-ms98-a-0050 331.181625 342.713750 for a while they built a a run for him out to the side of the house you know he'd been on the patio but they put the run out there and he didn't like this run because there were no people that came by
sw2806A-ms98-a-0051 342.713750 356.391875 and sometimes he would just make a racket until you came and got him and one night we'd forgotten to put water out for him and and Hal and i were in bed and all of a sudden there was all this noise out to the side the house and and he'd pick up his dish and throw it in the air
sw2806A-ms98-a-0052 356.391875 357.812375 [laughter]
sw2806A-ms98-a-0053 357.812375 365.123875 and then bark and march around you know and then he'd pick up his dish again and throw it in the air [laughter] until we came out and gave him some [laughter-water]
sw2806A-ms98-a-0054 365.123875 367.252625 [laughter]
sw2806A-ms98-a-0055 367.252625 368.420750 [silence]
sw2806A-ms98-a-0056 368.420750 369.796250 did what
sw2806A-ms98-a-0057 369.796250 371.890625 [silence]
sw2806A-ms98-a-0058 371.890625 384.345625 no he didn't eat flies no they eat uh they greens uh we fed him the outside leaves of lettuce you know i'd get lettuce at the store and he'd eat the outside leaves
sw2806A-ms98-a-0059 384.345625 393.469750 and then in the summertime you could put him out and he'd eat outside oh except you had to keep him away from the garden because he liked to eat the little peas as fast as they came up you know
sw2806A-ms98-a-0060 393.469750 400.240500 it was really [laughter] it was really a glamor and of things that were fresh sprigs you know he liked that
sw2806A-ms98-a-0061 400.240500 402.594125 but
sw2806A-ms98-a-0062 402.594125 408.999500 well yeah when uh when Dan went to college up at Ricksun Idaho he took him with him
sw2806A-ms98-a-0063 408.999500 415.806000 and uh everybody was used to him and they just loved him and what not and this his roommate put him out one day
sw2806A-ms98-a-0064 415.806000 424.292500 and Dan didn't know it and it got dark and he didn't get him in again and they searched and searched and searched for him but uh
sw2806A-ms98-a-0065 424.292500 430.255625 uh it got too cold up there and he he died in a tree tha[t]- they found him the next day in a tree he was dead
sw2806A-ms98-a-0066 430.255625 438.340125 so you ca[n't]- you have to be pretty tender with them we had a he had his own heat lamp and uh and uh hot pad he laid on you know
sw2806A-ms98-a-0067 438.340125 446.447375 that was another funny thing he had a hot pad and it it burned up one time and boy it was that was funny too watching him kind of burned up but anyway
sw2806A-ms98-a-0068 446.447375 453.290375 and we got him a new one he had a blue one before and when we got him a new one it was brown and he wouldn't lay on it till we changed the covers
sw2806A-ms98-a-0069 453.290375 455.315375 no he wouldn't lay on it
sw2806A-ms98-a-0070 455.315375 456.957375 bu[t]-
sw2806A-ms98-a-0071 456.957375 466.088500 so they really are they really pick up things he was a he was a clean animal uh we h[ad]- he went to the bathroom in the bathroom 
sw2806A-ms98-a-0072 466.088500 472.310250 put well we put some papers on the floor underneath the john and he went there to go to the bathroom
sw2806A-ms98-a-0073 472.310250 482.940875 you had to be sure you left the doors open you know he didn't like to go anywhere else he'd he'd scratch and do all kinds of things to get you to open the door if you happened to close it on him or something you know but
sw2806A-ms98-a-0074 482.940875 496.720875 but even when he went when he had an accident or something uh if you just let it dry it dries kind of like uh especially when he was inside and eating just lettuce it dried up a little bit like ashes and you could just vacuum it up
sw2806A-ms98-a-0075 496.720875 509.292875 the winter time there was no smell at all no odor at all to it in the summertime when he was outside and eating outside the smell was a little bit like a cat you know 
sw2806A-ms98-a-0076 509.292875 510.888375 but uh
sw2806A-ms98-a-0077 510.888375 512.109125 [silence]
