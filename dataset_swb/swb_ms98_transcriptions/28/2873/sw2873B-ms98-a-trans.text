sw2873B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 3.786750 [noise]
sw2873B-ms98-a-0002 3.786750 7.278000 well M[avericks]- probably the one that plays here [vocalized-noise]
sw2873B-ms98-a-0003 7.278000 15.021750 the Mavericks uh they're not doing the greatest that i've seen them_1 play before but uh well they're doing okay
sw2873B-ms98-a-0004 15.021750 16.674000 bu[t]- but
sw2873B-ms98-a-0005 16.674000 28.798375 no no i i think without uh Roy Tarpley they're he he added something to the team but uh i think they need to let him go maybe
sw2873B-ms98-a-0006 28.798375 41.325375 he doesn't seem to course i have a lot of players that i think are really super i think Isaiah Thomas is just great and uh i think uh he
sw2873B-ms98-a-0007 41.325375 52.046125 he does really well i like to watch him play he just has a really good moves and uh [noise] i don't know i i guess uh
sw2873B-ms98-a-0008 52.046125 53.567375 [silence]

sw2873B-ms98-a-0011 56.233625 68.800000 i guess i like to watch the Mailman play for the the Utah team uh when he delivers he does okay and uh uh
sw2873B-ms98-a-0012 68.800000 78.370375 i can't think of the name of the team that has Larry Bird on it oh the Celtics i like to watch them play the whole team i like their whole team
sw2873B-ms98-a-0013 78.370375 79.449000 [silence]

sw2873B-ms98-a-0017 86.557125 93.456500 um-hum i you know like i said i like Isaiah Thomas but i think sometimes that uh
sw2873B-ms98-a-0018 93.456500 104.289250 that uh he he sometimes ends up being a one man team uh whereas the Celtics like you said they play more as a team um
sw2873B-ms98-a-0019 104.289250 105.479000 [silence]
sw2873B-ms98-a-0020 105.479000 113.043500 yeah i like Michael Jordan a lot too he's really good uh
sw2873B-ms98-a-0021 113.043500 117.505000 Danny Ainge he pl[ays]- i like Danny Ainge okay
sw2873B-ms98-a-0022 117.505000 118.617125 [silence]

sw2873B-ms98-a-0024 120.914000 123.541250 [silence]
sw2873B-ms98-a-0025 123.541250 132.430750 well i guess because he played at at my alma mater [laughter] so i i kind of watch him every now and again
sw2873B-ms98-a-0026 132.430750 139.282875 yeah yeah yeah and he played really well when he was there so
sw2873B-ms98-a-0027 139.282875 151.747125 uh it's it's hard to uh name him with some of the very top players i think sometimes but i'm glad he's playing in the in the pros yeah he's a [vocalized-noise]
sw2873B-ms98-a-0028 151.747125 153.329750 [silence]
sw2873B-ms98-a-0029 153.329750 157.396375 you just wondered why i named him huh [laughter]

sw2873B-ms98-a-0033 172.619500 180.257625 yeah they yeah i i liked when he uh he was playing with Celtics and then he traded to Portland
sw2873B-ms98-a-0034 180.257625 183.956000 and uh it was a good trade so
sw2873B-ms98-a-0035 183.956000 200.500250 [silence]
sw2873B-ms98-a-0036 200.500250 202.193500 um
sw2873B-ms98-a-0037 202.193500 212.892625 i don't remember i really don't it seems like he went straight there you know because i don't remember him playing for a[nother]- another team other than straight through
sw2873B-ms98-a-0038 212.892625 214.348250 yeah
sw2873B-ms98-a-0039 214.348250 219.693625 [silence]

sw2873B-ms98-a-0052 254.614625 256.929375 yeah yeah
sw2873B-ms98-a-0053 256.929375 269.432250 [silence]
sw2873B-ms98-a-0054 269.432250 270.713750 um-hum
sw2873B-ms98-a-0055 270.713750 284.294250 [silence]
sw2873B-ms98-a-0056 284.294250 291.458375 i watched uh well i didn't watch them but i i saw in the newspaper and i[n]- on the news the play-off teams and
sw2873B-ms98-a-0057 291.458375 301.406875 and without Larry Bird and and Michael Jordan when they got injured you know it was interesting i think then how their teams did um
sw2873B-ms98-a-0058 301.406875 311.137375 how it i[t]- i[t]- brought the scoring down a little bit but their teams stayed relatively together you know and so
sw2873B-ms98-a-0059 311.137375 325.309250 you know i think sometimes it's interesting we we really watch the big name players and but they have to have a solid team underneath or else they really don't don't go anywhere
sw2873B-ms98-a-0060 325.309250 337.747250 so i i think that's kind of the Mavericks problem they have okay players but sometimes the strongness of the team isn't together
sw2873B-ms98-a-0061 337.747250 347.447125 you know every once in a while they click during a a game and then it works for them_1 but then it's just not always there
sw2873B-ms98-a-0062 347.447125 350.608000 so i i guess that's [laughter]
sw2873B-ms98-a-0063 350.608000 357.763875 [silence]
sw2873B-ms98-a-0064 357.763875 359.468000 yeah
sw2873B-ms98-a-0065 359.468000 365.098250 [silence]
sw2873B-ms98-a-0066 365.098250 368.603875 English did okay he did okay
sw2873B-ms98-a-0067 368.603875 370.969625 but uh
sw2873B-ms98-a-0068 370.969625 372.879750 oh
sw2873B-ms98-a-0069 372.879750 374.518000 [silence]
sw2873B-ms98-a-0070 374.518000 380.275375 i think Adubato as the coach of their team uh has done a l[ot]- a lot for them
sw2873B-ms98-a-0071 380.275375 386.852000 i think he he's uh brought some strength to that team um
sw2873B-ms98-a-0072 386.852000 395.982375 um he he's really trying hard he's a nice guy i like him as the coach of the Mavericks so
sw2873B-ms98-a-0073 395.982375 400.852125 i don't i don't know a lot of coaches in the in the NBA though
sw2873B-ms98-a-0074 400.852125 401.954375 [silence]
sw2873B-ms98-a-0075 401.954375 403.781375 yeah that's true
sw2873B-ms98-a-0076 403.781375 408.314125 [silence]
sw2873B-ms98-a-0077 408.314125 411.682750 yeah that's [laughter-true] that's true 
sw2873B-ms98-a-0078 411.682750 421.858125 [silence]
sw2873B-ms98-a-0079 421.858125 423.177875 yeah
sw2873B-ms98-a-0080 423.177875 426.350250 i think they're i think they'll let him go
sw2873B-ms98-a-0081 426.350250 428.012125 [silence]
sw2873B-ms98-a-0082 428.012125 437.403750 anyway i i uh i like basketball it's a fun sport i i like to watch it i like to um
sw2873B-ms98-a-0083 437.403750 448.615000 i guess i like it because of of the quickness of it um and and i like it because it takes the players
sw2873B-ms98-a-0084 448.615000 450.937625 have to be
sw2873B-ms98-a-0085 450.937625 452.087875 [silence]
sw2873B-ms98-a-0086 452.087875 460.682375 you know it's not a game where you can just not practice i mean they have to be on the top of their game to be in the NBA i think
sw2873B-ms98-a-0087 460.682375 462.170375 yeah or else
sw2873B-ms98-a-0088 462.170375 463.514000 [silence]
sw2873B-ms98-a-0089 463.514000 465.626625 yeah yeah
sw2873B-ms98-a-0090 465.626625 469.164125 [silence]
sw2873B-ms98-a-0091 469.164125 482.576500 i don't watch too much of that i watch our town Plano uh Plano East is where my children will go i have an eleven year old son and he plays basketball and my so[n]- my husband coaches his team
sw2873B-ms98-a-0092 482.576500 489.660500 and uh they uh i think they were one off one loss to the play-off
sw2873B-ms98-a-0093 489.660500 500.858875 and uh i like to watch our Plano East Senior High boys play they are they did really well so yeah
sw2873B-ms98-a-0094 500.858875 510.556500 i like yeah i do like um the the games not only basketball but the other ones too that the high schools play i keep up with that
sw2873B-ms98-a-0095 510.556500 512.009000 so
sw2873B-ms98-a-0096 512.009000 525.459250 [silence]
sw2873B-ms98-a-0097 525.459250 526.841375 yeah
sw2873B-ms98-a-0098 526.841375 535.001000 [silence]
sw2873B-ms98-a-0099 535.001000 537.153125 yeah yeah
sw2873B-ms98-a-0100 537.153125 538.565250 [silence]
sw2873B-ms98-a-0101 538.565250 543.261625 well you know what i think is you know like Spud Webb i mean
sw2873B-ms98-a-0102 543.261625 551.354625 you can really even if you're short like that you know in basketball today they get these huge tall players that
sw2873B-ms98-a-0103 551.354625 558.458375 that just are you know if you want to do it bad enough i think it's a possibility in anybody's life
sw2873B-ms98-a-0104 558.458375 564.203250 [vocalized-noise] he's he really goes for it and he's a good little player you know so
sw2873B-ms98-a-0105 564.203250 570.158875 i think if if any of these boys want to do it they really can if that's really their dream
sw2873B-ms98-a-0106 570.158875 576.125375 so [vocalized-noise] takes work though that's the big yeah yeah
sw2873B-ms98-a-0107 576.125375 582.078000 [silence]
sw2873B-ms98-a-0108 582.078000 584.381375 yeah yeah
sw2873B-ms98-a-0109 584.381375 588.918500 [silence]
sw2873B-ms98-a-0110 588.918500 590.402125 well
sw2873B-ms98-a-0111 590.402125 599.871125 i just think that basketball's a fun game and and i guess i still have to stick with the Mavericks i guess as far [laughter-as]
