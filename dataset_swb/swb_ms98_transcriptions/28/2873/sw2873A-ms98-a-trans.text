sw2873A-ms98-a-0040 154.147500 161.561500 i wondered yeah i wondered everybody has their their favorite you know maybe not the the big name player but uh
sw2873A-ms98-a-0041 161.561500 173.494875 yeah he's playing a vital role he he's playing for Portland he's playing for Portland he's i mean he's coming in and doing a good job he's it was a great trade how they got him
sw2873A-ms98-a-0042 173.494875 179.627250 [silence]

sw2873A-ms98-a-0047 186.419375 193.108500 i don't know if it's mainly because of him but it seems that he plays for top teams
sw2873A-ms98-a-0048 193.108500 202.941875 and uh you know contenders uh he might have uh did he go straight from Boston to Portland or did he hit another team on the way
sw2873A-ms98-a-0049 202.941875 205.445625 [silence]
sw2873A-ms98-a-0050 205.445625 206.961250 but uh

sw2873A-ms98-a-0054 212.128625 213.759000 yeah
sw2873A-ms98-a-0055 213.759000 221.793375 but uh yeah he's uh i- i like to watch him play because_1 he's a yeah he's pretty tough you know he's he's a scrappy guy
sw2873A-ms98-a-0056 221.793375 223.373625 [silence]
sw2873A-ms98-a-0057 223.373625 225.012250 he's a competitor
sw2873A-ms98-a-0058 225.012250 226.019500 [silence]
sw2873A-ms98-a-0059 226.019500 234.963375 oh do i have a favorite team uh well i'm from Indiana so i like the Pacers and uh
sw2873A-ms98-a-0060 234.963375 238.893000 i like Larry Bird because_1 he's from the home state also
sw2873A-ms98-a-0061 238.893000 242.952125 i just likewatch him play anyway uh
sw2873A-ms98-a-0062 242.952125 244.038250 [silence]
sw2873A-ms98-a-0063 244.038250 255.354250 let's see i like the Bulls because_1 they're from the Chicago area and uh they've uh suffered through many a hard season before they got Jordan
sw2873A-ms98-a-0064 255.354250 269.769625 and uh even then once they got him they didn't make the play-offs for a couple years they had to gradually build up a supporting cast because you can't just win with one player in the NBA you have to have a a you know a good solid team
sw2873A-ms98-a-0065 269.769625 283.874375 even though one player can carry a bulk of the of the scoring load you know you have to have the other players there to complement him and finally with uh Pippen and some of the Horace Grant some of the other guys are coming right along
sw2873A-ms98-a-0066 283.874375 299.619500 [silence]

sw2873A-ms98-a-0077 350.241000 358.655625 well they made a couple trades th[is]- this year that uh well Fat Lever was hurt most of the year
sw2873A-ms98-a-0078 358.655625 365.346500 and that so they didn't get to reap any benefits from that and uh i don't know how well Alex English did but
sw2873A-ms98-a-0079 365.346500 366.540250 [silence]
sw2873A-ms98-a-0080 366.540250 367.850625 okay_1

sw2873A-ms98-a-0082 369.084375 376.020500 s[ee]- see we don't have a TV so i didn't get to watch any of the Mavericks i think i got to watch probably one game all year so

sw2873A-ms98-a-0086 400.014375 403.041000 well they move around so much
sw2873A-ms98-a-0087 403.041000 410.226000 can't hardly keep a one coach where he's at for very long enough to get know who he is
sw2873A-ms98-a-0088 410.226000 423.796250 yeah i think uh like you said i mean Tarpley if he was had his life straightened up he could really help a ball club but you know the way w[ell]- he's operating now he's more of a detriment than anything else
sw2873A-ms98-a-0089 423.796250 425.718875 [silence]
sw2873A-ms98-a-0090 425.718875 427.320000 they should

sw2873A-ms98-a-0113 518.370250 530.455750 bad points of watching it each each different one i mean you may not see a spectacular Michael {Jordanish} move from a high school player but you know it's more of an accomplishment if if they hit
sw2873A-ms98-a-0114 530.455750 538.351000 you know some three pointers or something the game is you know it's just a different game pretty much but that's sort of what makes it fun
