sw2897A-ms98-a-0044 261.685750 273.155500 [silence]
sw2897A-ms98-a-0045 273.155500 279.929500 um Workm[en]- Workmen's Comp is a big thing now in in Texas because um
sw2897A-ms98-a-0046 279.929500 287.365250 um how much it costs the employers and a a lot of them are going to their own insurance now
sw2897A-ms98-a-0047 287.365250 291.782625 and it reduces some of the length of the benefits and uh
sw2897A-ms98-a-0048 291.782625 299.732625 and i don't know besides that but i i noticed right off that was a year less than what the state was allowing
sw2897A-ms98-a-0049 299.732625 305.302000 [silence]
sw2897A-ms98-a-0050 305.302000 311.255125 well well they still have to pay it but they buy their own instead of going through the state
sw2897A-ms98-a-0051 311.255125 313.999250 so apparently it costs less that way
sw2897A-ms98-a-0052 313.999250 323.637500 [silence]
sw2897A-ms98-a-0053 323.637500 325.340750 uh-huh

sw2897A-ms98-a-0055 332.707250 340.445750 yeah that's what i what i think the[y]- they should be able they should be able to judge their benefits on how happy their employees are
sw2897A-ms98-a-0056 340.445750 349.356125 and how much profit they're making instead of trying to cut everything down and then have everybody be unhappy and and have a constant turnover of people
sw2897A-ms98-a-0057 349.356125 355.665125 [silence]
sw2897A-ms98-a-0058 355.665125 364.926750 yeah the productivity and the training costs if they have to train the same employee a new employee every six months then i don't see how they can save money
sw2897A-ms98-a-0059 364.926750 369.903750 you know and once they once they get somebody good they ought to hang onto them
sw2897A-ms98-a-0060 369.903750 372.672875 [silence]
