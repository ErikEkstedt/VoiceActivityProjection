sw2897B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 5.283875 [noise]
sw2897B-ms98-a-0002 5.283875 7.996250 um i'm i'm
sw2897B-ms98-a-0003 7.996250 16.063750 r[elatively]- relatively satisfied with the benefits i have i think that um our health insurance is terribly expensive
sw2897B-ms98-a-0004 16.063750 22.436250 i'd rather that we got a bit more coverage for a lot less [laughter-money]
sw2897B-ms98-a-0005 22.436250 27.477000 but um you know that's that's my major complaint i guess what about you
sw2897B-ms98-a-0006 27.477000 32.856375 [silence]
sw2897B-ms98-a-0007 32.856375 34.175375 uh-huh
sw2897B-ms98-a-0008 34.175375 35.180625 [silence]
sw2897B-ms98-a-0009 35.180625 40.955750 or or maybe that it's not understood what should be covered and what isn't
sw2897B-ms98-a-0010 40.955750 42.119750 [silence]
sw2897B-ms98-a-0011 42.119750 44.377000 yeah i
sw2897B-ms98-a-0012 44.377000 59.755125 [silence]
sw2897B-ms98-a-0013 59.755125 61.314375 i see
sw2897B-ms98-a-0014 61.314375 68.969375 now we i have just the regular insurance so that any doctor is covered but what i found recently is
sw2897B-ms98-a-0015 68.969375 73.689375 what they've been doing is they they poll somehow the area
sw2897B-ms98-a-0016 73.689375 83.092000 and then they have what they consider a justifiable price for the area where your doctor is located based on zip code
sw2897B-ms98-a-0017 83.092000 87.134750 and so recently when when we had a claim
sw2897B-ms98-a-0018 87.134750 100.425750 um they didn't pay the eighty five percent they paid much lower and when i called they said oh well that's because your doctor is charging much more than the norm for the area and i was really surprised because
sw2897B-ms98-a-0019 100.425750 107.983625 either there aren't that many of that type of doctor within that zip code so that you know two doctors could balance each other out
sw2897B-ms98-a-0020 107.983625 112.471500 or their you know their statistics aren't very accurate
sw2897B-ms98-a-0021 112.471500 116.727375 [silence]
sw2897B-ms98-a-0022 116.727375 123.563500 yeah i would assume that you [laughter-know] whatever doctors are willing to do the paperwork and send it in
sw2897B-ms98-a-0023 123.563500 130.710000 but it's it's difficult What about other other benefits are there others that you're dissatisfied with
sw2897B-ms98-a-0024 130.710000 137.063250 [silence]
sw2897B-ms98-a-0025 137.063250 139.596000 well you have vacation i mean
sw2897B-ms98-a-0026 139.596000 153.924375 [silence]
sw2897B-ms98-a-0027 153.924375 155.986000 huh
sw2897B-ms98-a-0028 155.986000 157.910250 [silence]
sw2897B-ms98-a-0029 157.910250 160.968000 yeah i'm not familiar with that sort of thing but
sw2897B-ms98-a-0030 160.968000 171.182875 but you know to me vacation [laughter] is is an issue and i mean different places have different amounts of vacation i would assume
sw2897B-ms98-a-0031 171.182875 178.418250 and um you know the leniency with which they let you take leave without pay perhaps or um
sw2897B-ms98-a-0032 178.418250 179.425750 [silence]
sw2897B-ms98-a-0033 179.425750 189.391625 um i don't know i suppose um sick days some places count the number of hours and some places just sort of believe you
sw2897B-ms98-a-0034 189.391625 199.616000 um ours is based on number of days and you know people try to build them up in case they really do get seriously ill
sw2897B-ms98-a-0035 199.616000 201.362250 right
sw2897B-ms98-a-0036 201.362250 205.136750 but um otherwise
sw2897B-ms98-a-0037 205.136750 210.567750 i'm not not aware of any problems with the benefits around here
sw2897B-ms98-a-0038 210.567750 213.764625 [silence]
sw2897B-ms98-a-0039 213.764625 217.294625 so maybe that covers the topic then
sw2897B-ms98-a-0040 217.294625 226.655500 [silence]
sw2897B-ms98-a-0041 226.655500 227.917375 uh-huh
sw2897B-ms98-a-0042 227.917375 233.063500 [silence]
sw2897B-ms98-a-0043 233.063500 243.493000 uh-huh or maybe a ben[efit]- uh not really a benefit either but would be the allowing you to use the telephone for personal calls
sw2897B-ms98-a-0044 243.493000 244.953125 um
sw2897B-ms98-a-0045 244.953125 250.722000 um but you know i suppose some places are are more stringent about that than others
sw2897B-ms98-a-0046 250.722000 252.903875 [silence]
sw2897B-ms98-a-0047 252.903875 259.889500 and and maybe arriving late or something like that you know how how they enforce the rules
sw2897B-ms98-a-0048 259.889500 263.911750 [silence]
sw2897B-ms98-a-0049 263.911750 275.637000 but other than that i don't have much feeling for [laughter] for the benefits since like i said um i don't have a big problem with with them i
sw2897B-ms98-a-0050 275.637000 282.486375 [silence]
sw2897B-ms98-a-0051 282.486375 284.537375 uh-huh
sw2897B-ms98-a-0052 284.537375 300.025000 [silence]
sw2897B-ms98-a-0053 300.025000 306.070375 oh i uh i didn't know that somebody could avoid Workmen's Compensation 
sw2897B-ms98-a-0054 306.070375 310.058750 [silence]
sw2897B-ms98-a-0055 310.058750 312.027875 oh i see
sw2897B-ms98-a-0056 312.027875 313.322500 [silence]
sw2897B-ms98-a-0057 313.322500 315.331250 uh-huh uh-huh
sw2897B-ms98-a-0058 315.331250 324.596875 i suppose that whenever companies can avoid um benefits it's to the to to the benefit of the company [laughter]
sw2897B-ms98-a-0059 324.596875 333.627375 and at least you know financially in the short run but i would think that they would get a much greater turnover and that people would be dissatisfied working for them 
sw2897B-ms98-a-0060 333.627375 348.792000 [silence]
sw2897B-ms98-a-0061 348.792000 357.057000 right i mean sure the payroll is lower that way but i would assume that the productivity is way down also
sw2897B-ms98-a-0062 357.057000 364.070625 [silence]
sw2897B-ms98-a-0063 364.070625 365.860750 uh-huh uh-huh
sw2897B-ms98-a-0064 365.860750 369.749500 [silence]
sw2897B-ms98-a-0065 369.749500 371.327125 that's right
sw2897B-ms98-a-0066 371.327125 373.104000 no i agree
sw2897B-ms98-a-0067 373.104000 375.137375 [silence]
sw2897B-ms98-a-0068 375.137375 378.135375 well thank you for calling bye-bye
sw2897B-ms98-a-0069 378.135375 380.086375 [noise]
