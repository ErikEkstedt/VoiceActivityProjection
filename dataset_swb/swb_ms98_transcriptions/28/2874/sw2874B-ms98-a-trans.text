sw2874B-ms98-a-0018 89.199750 104.067000 or cat or whatever and some other strange stuff but in this particular lake we went out with some friends once and we just every time you tossed the line in you pull up a five six seven inch minimum bass and usually you pull up you know thirteen to fourteen inch bass
sw2874B-ms98-a-0019 104.067000 111.735750 yeah it's a real it's a real enjoyable experience to go fishing there because we just we pull up you know bass after bass and
sw2874B-ms98-a-0020 111.735750 115.902250 during perch season as well you pull up a lot of
sw2874B-ms98-a-0021 115.902250 130.382625 uh probably during during perch season the perch will run in very large schools so what they'll do is j[ust]- you'll you'll be sort of boating around these people own a little row boat and they'll be boating around and they'll hit a they'll hit a school of perches in the middle
sw2874B-ms98-a-0022 130.382625 137.510250 and when they do you can just drop the lines in and just pull them in one at they they just drop it in they they can't pull it in fast enough

sw2874B-ms98-a-0026 147.955875 157.086625 they tend to use i guess worms or some kind of lures sometimes but you know i've she told me that they will sometimes use corn or anything you know
sw2874B-ms98-a-0027 157.086625 163.694500 they'll corn or salami or bread or anything they'll they'll they'll hit because they're just sort of surrounded these large schools

sw2874B-ms98-a-0065 331.850125 338.267250 the captain had you know some kind of sonar in the boat so he'd maneuver us in into a school of fish and you just drop it in and
sw2874B-ms98-a-0066 338.267250 342.668625 and it just you you get one or two at a shot you know and
