sw2839A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.177000 [noise]
sw2839A-ms98-a-0002 0.177000 2.346500 all right
sw2839A-ms98-a-0003 2.346500 15.392500 [silence]
sw2839A-ms98-a-0004 15.392500 25.490500 uh i guess what i feel about it is that it's so mismanaged that it there's got to be something when when we pay so much for the for the debt
sw2839A-ms98-a-0005 25.490500 38.965125 instead of using the money for where it ought to go it it's just it's ridiculous What kills me is when they had a chance to to uh put into ac[tion]- action the the G[ramm]- the G[ramm]- Rud[man]- what is it
sw2839A-ms98-a-0006 38.965125 51.315875 uh the act where they had to cut everything across the board they kept doing they kept putting off doing that why did they do that that's exactly what they needed to do to get their act together
sw2839A-ms98-a-0007 51.315875 55.065375 [silence]
sw2839A-ms98-a-0008 55.065375 57.519125 oh yeah i think so too
sw2839A-ms98-a-0009 57.519125 61.897250 [silence]
sw2839A-ms98-a-0010 61.897250 75.194750 yeah well things like mailings they don't use any kind of restraint on some of these things they just think once they get there that they can do just anything you know they don't they don't try to uh to conserve
sw2839A-ms98-a-0011 75.194750 81.665375 and of course here at home we end up conserving and conserving and i mean when i don't have money i don't buy something
sw2839A-ms98-a-0012 81.665375 86.778625 [silence]
sw2839A-ms98-a-0013 86.778625 89.205875 they sure don't seem to
sw2839A-ms98-a-0014 89.205875 90.488000 [silence]
sw2839A-ms98-a-0015 90.488000 100.376375 there're a couple of things i think we need to really work for and i don't know quite how to do it but i think we need to have the one line uh uh veto
sw2839A-ms98-a-0016 100.376375 106.726500 so that they don't have to spend so much time doing everything if it's a good idea it can be done again
sw2839A-ms98-a-0017 106.726500 113.786125 you know and if it's not so what at least you haven't thrown out all the work they've done for months and months and months and months
sw2839A-ms98-a-0018 113.786125 145.059875 [silence]
sw2839A-ms98-a-0019 145.059875 146.576125 [laughter]
sw2839A-ms98-a-0020 146.576125 149.218750 yeah this is that's right
sw2839A-ms98-a-0021 149.218750 154.251750 [silence]
sw2839A-ms98-a-0022 154.251750 156.132500 yeah
sw2839A-ms98-a-0023 156.132500 156.967250 [silence]
sw2839A-ms98-a-0024 156.967250 166.548750 yeah that's just an awful lot of that kind of thing going on and the trouble is you don't you have so little input about it you don't know enough
sw2839A-ms98-a-0025 166.548750 170.854875 to know what what to do about some of this stuff i
sw2839A-ms98-a-0026 170.854875 172.394375 [silence]
sw2839A-ms98-a-0027 172.394375 182.768750 yeah that's right the other thing about is i think uh limiting their time in office would be good i- i just can't believe there aren't other people out there that could do just as well as what we've got
sw2839A-ms98-a-0028 182.768750 189.548875 [silence]
sw2839A-ms98-a-0029 189.548875 190.806125 yeah
sw2839A-ms98-a-0030 190.806125 197.381125 [silence]
sw2839A-ms98-a-0031 197.381125 199.488000 yeah i think that's right
sw2839A-ms98-a-0032 199.488000 202.971500 [silence]
sw2839A-ms98-a-0033 202.971500 204.509625 yeah wouldn't that be too bad
sw2839A-ms98-a-0034 204.509625 205.602375 [laughter]
sw2839A-ms98-a-0035 205.602375 209.945375 well that's right i think i don't know i think uh
sw2839A-ms98-a-0036 209.945375 212.382625 people in general the the the
sw2839A-ms98-a-0037 212.382625 222.730875 the idea of what you need to to exist is so outrageous that it's not hardly you know it starts at the courts it starts everywhere
sw2839A-ms98-a-0038 222.730875 230.500750 until we can't we've just lost control of of any kind of perspective about what is acceptable and what is not acceptable you know
sw2839A-ms98-a-0039 230.500750 232.245125 [silence]
sw2839A-ms98-a-0040 232.245125 236.090125 no you can't even can't even conceive of what they're talking about
sw2839A-ms98-a-0041 236.090125 237.795750 [silence]
sw2839A-ms98-a-0042 237.795750 243.438500 yeah yeah i mean it jus[t]- and and you just
sw2839A-ms98-a-0043 243.438500 250.428625 the other thing is it's it's all very well to give money to help people other people and i think we need to do that
sw2839A-ms98-a-0044 250.428625 255.205500 but there are they need to put more limits on them they need to restrain about what they do
sw2839A-ms98-a-0045 255.205500 257.202625 [silence]
sw2839A-ms98-a-0046 257.202625 258.683000 yeah
sw2839A-ms98-a-0047 258.683000 266.835250 i- i you know i think that's probably un[less]- unless we can afford it if we pay off the debts then we can give it to people again
sw2839A-ms98-a-0048 266.835250 275.614625 you know i don't really mind helping people but you you need to get rid of this thing that's that's just uh eating us up
sw2839A-ms98-a-0049 275.614625 282.944500 you know and get things on a on an even if it were if it were a family we'd be up before the
sw2839A-ms98-a-0050 282.944500 285.352250 the magistrate [laughter]
sw2839A-ms98-a-0051 285.352250 291.021250 for for doing all these wicked things you know but the government does it and it's all right
sw2839A-ms98-a-0052 291.021250 298.407500 [silence]
sw2839A-ms98-a-0053 298.407500 300.293000 yeah that's true
sw2839A-ms98-a-0054 300.293000 301.703125 [silence]
sw2839A-ms98-a-0055 301.703125 303.037000 well sounds like
sw2839A-ms98-a-0056 303.037000 308.475500 [silence]
sw2839A-ms98-a-0057 308.475500 311.912375 yeah it's good to see them_1 doing some things there anyway
sw2839A-ms98-a-0058 311.912375 317.924375 [silence]
sw2839A-ms98-a-0059 317.924375 320.032750 yeah
sw2839A-ms98-a-0060 320.032750 323.319625 [silence]
sw2839A-ms98-a-0061 323.319625 325.654875 well
sw2839A-ms98-a-0062 325.654875 326.724625 [silence]
sw2839A-ms98-a-0063 326.724625 338.810625 i think we have to accept the fact that whatever happens we're going to have to bite the bullet and we're all going to have to do it i it just isn't fair though that when this happens in some places it needs to all come off everywhere
sw2839A-ms98-a-0064 338.810625 348.517250 that's why i thought well you know this is the time they need to put that into act[ion]- into action and show they mean business that they've got to cut they've got to cut costs
sw2839A-ms98-a-0065 348.517250 368.148500 [silence]
sw2839A-ms98-a-0066 368.148500 370.457250 yeah i think that's right
sw2839A-ms98-a-0067 370.457250 377.634750 well i don't i don't really mind paying taxes for for positive things
sw2839A-ms98-a-0068 377.634750 387.435375 that are helps like roads and making sure that uh that water is safe and some of these things but um
sw2839A-ms98-a-0069 387.435375 388.621125 [silence]
sw2839A-ms98-a-0070 388.621125 402.584875 you know it you just feel like it's out of control you feel like they do not have control of it and that and so then it just aggravates you you know you think i could spend my money i could help the poor people better by myself than they're doing
sw2839A-ms98-a-0071 402.584875 404.015875 so it's
sw2839A-ms98-a-0072 404.015875 404.924500 [silence]
sw2839A-ms98-a-0073 404.924500 406.671500 yeah
sw2839A-ms98-a-0074 406.671500 409.297375 [silence]
sw2839A-ms98-a-0075 409.297375 416.535250 well i think that's right if they don't do if they don't if they don't pull it in and start doing something i think they're really going to have to i think
sw2839A-ms98-a-0076 416.535250 433.117625 [silence]
sw2839A-ms98-a-0077 433.117625 435.304250 yeah yeah
sw2839A-ms98-a-0078 435.304250 441.066000 [silence]
sw2839A-ms98-a-0079 441.066000 446.574625 yeah in some ways we're awful lucky i guess there a lot of lot of places where it's worse than it is here but
sw2839A-ms98-a-0080 446.574625 450.049875 still you don't want it to get that bad good heavens
sw2839A-ms98-a-0081 450.049875 459.384000 no we need to get try to get hold of it and and have it be things be honest and and i guess in the fact i don't really mind paying taxes
sw2839A-ms98-a-0082 459.384000 468.595125 but i would just like to know that they're not being foolishly spent that they're doing something that's positive for for somebody
sw2839A-ms98-a-0083 468.595125 471.681250 i don't really feel like uh
sw2839A-ms98-a-0084 471.681250 481.588875 i don't really feel like i use taxes [laughter-very] [laughter-much] [laughter-i] don't know maybe i do more than i- i guess i do i use them in the in roads and lot of things but uh
sw2839A-ms98-a-0085 481.588875 495.832625 [silence]
sw2839A-ms98-a-0086 495.832625 497.309000 yeah
sw2839A-ms98-a-0087 497.309000 502.010875 [silence]
sw2839A-ms98-a-0088 502.010875 509.310750 yeah they've done some good things the state actually did some good good work on that in that a couple of years ago
sw2839A-ms98-a-0089 509.310750 515.522125 uh Sam Johnson came out and talked to us about that bout what they had done and they they really had done some good
sw2839A-ms98-a-0090 515.522125 516.789500 some good work
sw2839A-ms98-a-0091 516.789500 519.463375 [silence]
sw2839A-ms98-a-0092 519.463375 520.743625 yeah
sw2839A-ms98-a-0093 520.743625 529.410875 yeah there are a lot of p[laces]- places where they're in real trouble and and i think it would be easy enough to be in trouble here too if they don't take if they don't take that early stand
sw2839A-ms98-a-0094 529.410875 534.971000 [silence]
sw2839A-ms98-a-0095 534.971000 536.845250 yeah that's probably right
sw2839A-ms98-a-0096 536.845250 543.306625 the growth is fast enough so that they can't afford to just dawdle and wait -[un]til something -[un]til they need them_1
