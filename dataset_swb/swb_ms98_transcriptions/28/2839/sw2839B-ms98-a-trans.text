sw2839B-ms98-a-0060 295.413500 301.260000 they don't even talk about that they just raise it they don't even consider it like you saying is to cut something back you know
sw2839B-ms98-a-0061 301.260000 302.129125 [silence]
sw2839B-ms98-a-0062 302.129125 310.357875 they are at least doing something now with the uh the military you know they're cutting some of that but of course now you know TI you know that's hurting us but although
sw2839B-ms98-a-0063 310.357875 311.943250 [silence]
sw2839B-ms98-a-0064 311.943250 320.727875 TI has gotten a lot of good contracts from the war and everything else and if they'll get a lot of programs in the future because of their exotic uh weapon systems but uh
sw2839B-ms98-a-0065 320.727875 328.902375 that's the only good that i've seen Congress do you know and everybody and all the Congressmen and the President and everybody uh
sw2839B-ms98-a-0066 328.902375 337.746375 [silence]

sw2839B-ms98-a-0069 347.812875 352.113125 yeah the only taxes i think that are well spent well not the only but uh
sw2839B-ms98-a-0070 352.113125 356.558750 i think the now i- i don't understand the present school thing but uh
sw2839B-ms98-a-0071 356.558750 361.657625 i have two daughters one's in college already and one's about uh to be in high school but uh
sw2839B-ms98-a-0072 361.657625 370.598125 i think that paying for school schools is the schools is the only answer really to get rid of crime and so i don't mind paying for school taxes even though my kids will be out of it you know
sw2839B-ms98-a-0073 370.598125 379.639000 [silence]

sw2839B-ms98-a-0080 403.240875 409.417750 i- i think that's a wide open subject what i think that uh people need to take a stand i think the people will here shortly uh
sw2839B-ms98-a-0081 409.417750 416.002750 [silence]
sw2839B-ms98-a-0082 416.002750 421.002125 i think the next time we have an election we need to try to get some of the ones that have been there forever out too that
sw2839B-ms98-a-0083 421.002125 427.509000 what they did last election and uh ninety some odd percent of the same old boys got back in you know so
sw2839B-ms98-a-0084 427.509000 430.619875 we need to try to get people to two terms so they
sw2839B-ms98-a-0085 430.619875 435.164125 respect our wishes you know they're supposed to represent us that's what they're called but they don't
sw2839B-ms98-a-0086 435.164125 440.701375 may[be]- may[be]- maybe we can change and get us rid of some of those guys that are in there guys and gals whatever they are
sw2839B-ms98-a-0087 440.701375 446.155500 [silence]
sw2839B-ms98-a-0088 446.155500 448.085875 i know but it
sw2839B-ms98-a-0089 448.085875 453.431125 no that's right you don't want to uh you want it to stay as good as it possibly can be
sw2839B-ms98-a-0090 453.431125 466.504500 [silence]
sw2839B-ms98-a-0091 466.504500 467.748750 right

sw2839B-ms98-a-0095 480.880000 486.291375 well i think one of the good ones in the metroplex uh in the last say twenty five years or so maybe longer
sw2839B-ms98-a-0096 486.291375 496.106625 they've built all these dams you know the Corps of Engineers have uh soon as they finish a lake they'll go at get another one and that we haven't had uh we've had droughts here in long summers 
sw2839B-ms98-a-0097 496.106625 503.818000 we've had good water supply and that's due to the Corps of Engineers building looking years ahead and building all these reservoirs for us you know
sw2839B-ms98-a-0098 503.818000 508.431125 [silence]
sw2839B-ms98-a-0099 508.431125 510.085250 yeah

sw2839B-ms98-a-0103 516.472250 521.922625 yeah i think anything for water supply like [vocalized-noise] California should do more of that too
sw2839B-ms98-a-0104 521.922625 523.305375 [silence]
sw2839B-ms98-a-0105 523.305375 525.554000 right

sw2839B-ms98-a-0107 528.810625 537.130250 right they just finished Joe Poole Lake over here and they need to start another one i think every time they finish one they ought to just have another one in line the water's critical
