sw2850A-ms98-a-0002 0.320000 3.566125 do you consider your company's benefits to be reasonably good
sw2850A-ms98-a-0003 3.566125 7.449750 [silence]
sw2850A-ms98-a-0004 7.449750 10.400000 okay yeah i work at Texas Instruments also
sw2850A-ms98-a-0005 10.400000 14.779250 [silence]
sw2850A-ms98-a-0006 14.779250 20.810875 [laughter] i've found that to be true they're getting better but uh there's room for improvement
sw2850A-ms98-a-0007 20.810875 35.768500 [silence]
sw2850A-ms98-a-0008 35.768500 48.257000 yeah well i'll have to agree with that uh if if you uh if your benefits plan isn't as good you're going to drive people away but uh it seems they're making an effort to to uh be better uh each year
sw2850A-ms98-a-0009 48.257000 55.710375 [silence]
sw2850A-ms98-a-0010 55.710375 57.599500 no that's true
sw2850A-ms98-a-0011 57.599500 63.398625 [silence]
sw2850A-ms98-a-0012 63.398625 68.928125 yeah well it's necessary to be competitive when i started work the they didn't have uh a dental plan
sw2850A-ms98-a-0013 68.928125 79.112375 and so you're on our own but uh that's improved uh immensely it still may not be competitive with other companies of our size but uh it's better than nothing right now
sw2850A-ms98-a-0014 79.112375 80.996750 it's got limitations
sw2850A-ms98-a-0015 80.996750 85.679625 [silence]
sw2850A-ms98-a-0016 85.679625 86.997875 right
sw2850A-ms98-a-0017 86.997875 120.896750 [silence]
sw2850A-ms98-a-0018 120.896750 134.013625 right well i think uh other improvements could be made say in the medical plan as well we really don't we really don't do a great deal for uh preventive care they don't offer uh say uh physicals every few years
sw2850A-ms98-a-0019 134.013625 138.433625 something like that uh if they could cover that it would be uh most beneficial i think
sw2850A-ms98-a-0020 138.433625 145.277375 [silence]
sw2850A-ms98-a-0021 145.277375 146.885625 right
sw2850A-ms98-a-0022 146.885625 148.896000 well you see something
sw2850A-ms98-a-0023 148.896000 152.938625 [silence]
sw2850A-ms98-a-0024 152.938625 154.256250 right
sw2850A-ms98-a-0025 154.256250 168.862250 well you'll see plans every now and then through Texins organization where they've got uh the type of screening you're talking about other uh uh types of preventive care but uh as far as uh it being a regular part of the the benefits plan uh i haven't seen that yet
sw2850A-ms98-a-0026 168.862250 183.314500 [silence]
sw2850A-ms98-a-0027 183.314500 185.501125 right now in particular
sw2850A-ms98-a-0028 185.501125 203.704125 [silence]
sw2850A-ms98-a-0029 203.704125 207.993375 getting away from uh medical benefits one of the best things i see is the CODA plan
sw2850A-ms98-a-0030 207.993375 211.040875 where there's a matched savings contribution
sw2850A-ms98-a-0031 211.040875 217.190000 [silence]
sw2850A-ms98-a-0032 217.190000 221.239500 well there's there's no catch the the you you contribute uh
sw2850A-ms98-a-0033 221.239500 229.048375 uh a fixed percent or as much as i guess up to fifteen percent of your salary and TI will match that up to two percent
sw2850A-ms98-a-0034 229.048375 233.245500 [silence]
sw2850A-ms98-a-0035 233.245500 234.714250 right
sw2850A-ms98-a-0036 234.714250 239.137375 [silence]
sw2850A-ms98-a-0037 239.137375 246.268625 the only catch is [laughter] you can't get a hold of the money unless you uh quit or terminate or retire
sw2850A-ms98-a-0038 246.268625 258.555625 [silence]
sw2850A-ms98-a-0039 258.555625 259.788750 yeah
sw2850A-ms98-a-0040 259.788750 262.162250 [silence]
sw2850A-ms98-a-0041 262.162250 266.379625 oh sure well it's meant to be a long term savings plan like an IRA
sw2850A-ms98-a-0042 266.379625 271.007750 [silence]
sw2850A-ms98-a-0043 271.007750 279.247500 you get the benefit that the money comes out of pre tax dollars they aren't taxing it right away and and uh it's all tax deferred uh as well
sw2850A-ms98-a-0044 279.247500 287.190375 [silence]
sw2850A-ms98-a-0045 287.190375 294.111375 sure i'd like to see something like a cafeteria plan where you only have to pay for the benefits that you use yourself
sw2850A-ms98-a-0046 294.111375 300.881000 instead of having to pay for benefits that other people use uh it gets subsidized by everybody's uh uh contribution
sw2850A-ms98-a-0047 300.881000 308.306625 [silence]
sw2850A-ms98-a-0048 308.306625 310.882500 i didn't think about that you're right that's true
sw2850A-ms98-a-0049 310.882500 316.114000 [silence]
sw2850A-ms98-a-0050 316.114000 317.459000 sure
sw2850A-ms98-a-0051 317.459000 327.633250 [silence]
sw2850A-ms98-a-0052 327.633250 330.042000 yeah you have to wonder [laughter]
sw2850A-ms98-a-0053 330.042000 337.500750 [silence]
sw2850A-ms98-a-0054 337.500750 341.339625 i just wonder how they would enforce something like that with the smoker policy
sw2850A-ms98-a-0055 341.339625 349.340875 [silence]
sw2850A-ms98-a-0056 349.340875 351.315125 yeah
sw2850A-ms98-a-0057 351.315125 352.416625 [silence]
sw2850A-ms98-a-0058 352.416625 357.738750 well i sure made sure that i got that uh form filled out as soon as possible and turned in
sw2850A-ms98-a-0059 357.738750 364.683875 because_1 uh if you don't they'll uh raise your rates by ten dollars a month uh up to a maximum of thirty dollars [laughter]
sw2850A-ms98-a-0060 364.683875 365.553125 [silence]
sw2850A-ms98-a-0061 365.553125 368.655625 people who neglect to do that are going to pay for it
sw2850A-ms98-a-0062 368.655625 372.642250 [silence]
sw2850A-ms98-a-0063 372.642250 373.978875 sure
sw2850A-ms98-a-0064 373.978875 384.891125 [silence]
sw2850A-ms98-a-0065 384.891125 386.340625 sure
sw2850A-ms98-a-0066 386.340625 387.416125 [silence]
sw2850A-ms98-a-0067 387.416125 391.355875 i've heard that the the smoking cessation plans are very good here
sw2850A-ms98-a-0068 391.355875 413.570625 [silence]
sw2850A-ms98-a-0069 413.570625 426.480375 that's that's very good i understand that when they first d[eveloped]- developed the nonsmoking policy uh the clean air policy as they call it that uh over two thousand people signed up for the smoking cessation classes the first year
sw2850A-ms98-a-0070 426.480375 444.813000 [silence]
sw2850A-ms98-a-0071 444.813000 446.019875 right
sw2850A-ms98-a-0072 446.019875 447.318750 [silence]
sw2850A-ms98-a-0073 447.318750 448.935750 uh-huh
sw2850A-ms98-a-0074 448.935750 460.148875 [silence]
sw2850A-ms98-a-0075 460.148875 464.963750 are there any benefits that you're still dissatisfied with that uh could use more improvement
sw2850A-ms98-a-0076 464.963750 471.190750 [laughter] yeah i'm not looking towards retirement quite yet but uh you're right
sw2850A-ms98-a-0077 471.190750 487.832375 [silence]
sw2850A-ms98-a-0078 487.832375 491.573750 about nineteen seventy two i started in seventy eight
sw2850A-ms98-a-0079 491.573750 494.902750 [silence]
sw2850A-ms98-a-0080 494.902750 496.329250 no
sw2850A-ms98-a-0081 496.329250 510.816875 [silence]
sw2850A-ms98-a-0082 510.816875 513.035375 sure
sw2850A-ms98-a-0083 513.035375 514.245500 [silence]
sw2850A-ms98-a-0084 514.245500 522.997375 yeah well if you look at the lump sum that you would get from uh say quitting right now terminating [laughter] it's hardly worth having a pension plan
sw2850A-ms98-a-0085 522.997375 524.156250 [silence]
sw2850A-ms98-a-0086 524.156250 526.337875 you can't live on it [laughter]
sw2850A-ms98-a-0087 526.337875 527.540500 [silence]
sw2850A-ms98-a-0088 527.540500 530.760875 and profit sharing is something we don't have a lot of control over
sw2850A-ms98-a-0089 530.760875 535.097500 but it seems that the company is going out of their way to not give us profit sharing
sw2850A-ms98-a-0090 535.097500 540.378750 becau[se]- we keep spending more money on uh on property and facilities
sw2850A-ms98-a-0091 540.378750 547.124375 [silence]
sw2850A-ms98-a-0092 547.124375 551.425000 that's right i think in my thirteen years i've had four years of profit sharing
sw2850A-ms98-a-0093 551.425000 559.101375 [silence]
sw2850A-ms98-a-0094 559.101375 563.123875 that's why i participate so heavily in the CODA plan uh [laughter]
sw2850A-ms98-a-0095 563.123875 578.880625 [silence]
sw2850A-ms98-a-0096 578.880625 580.204375 right
sw2850A-ms98-a-0097 580.204375 583.465125 [silence]
sw2850A-ms98-a-0098 583.465125 592.938625 well i think that's the right attitude for a company like this to have in order to survive but a lot of people aren't getting the message and they don't have any type of savings plan established
sw2850A-ms98-a-0099 592.938625 599.824125 [silence]
