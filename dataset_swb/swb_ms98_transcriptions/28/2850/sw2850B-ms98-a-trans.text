sw2850B-ms98-a-0006 9.322500 15.571750 uh so uh i think TI uh likes to live in the middle of the road

sw2850B-ms98-a-0008 17.299500 18.794750 yeah uh

sw2850B-ms98-a-0010 20.143125 29.754500 yeah well i i i'm serious i think they really do uh if they can stay about midway between the the companies who have excellent
sw2850B-ms98-a-0011 29.754500 36.350125 whatever and uh and and the ones who have very poor whatever that's where they want to be right about the middle of the road

sw2850B-ms98-a-0015 46.610625 56.512250 yeah and there's no reason to i don't think they consider it to be any uh particular reason to go out and have the very best in the industry
sw2850B-ms98-a-0016 56.512250 64.111625 all they want to do is make it acceptable which uh probably from a business standpoint is is what you want to do i guess
sw2850B-ms98-a-0017 64.111625 68.360500 [silence]
sw2850B-ms98-a-0018 68.360500 70.565625 uh-huh yeah

sw2850B-ms98-a-0021 78.220625 86.410125 yeah that's true i'm i have i have used the dental plan several times for myself and also my family so you know i'm glad to have it
sw2850B-ms98-a-0022 86.410125 91.919250 but i i i was there also before the dental plan was in place and and we
sw2850B-ms98-a-0023 91.919250 102.998750 we stayed on our our personnel people at the plant uh continuously for for years literally i mean trying to to get a dental plan in place because it it had
sw2850B-ms98-a-0024 102.998750 110.327125 it had started becoming a thing that a lot of major companies were doing getting dental plans and it took us a l[ong]- a long time
sw2850B-ms98-a-0025 110.327125 121.536000 well i mean we didn't have anything directly to do with it i'm sure but you know we had talked about it and we were aware of it for a long time before TI finally [laughter] got on the bandwagon i guess
sw2850B-ms98-a-0026 121.536000 125.450500 [silence]
sw2850B-ms98-a-0027 125.450500 128.003500 yeah the medical [laughter]

sw2850B-ms98-a-0033 137.168500 145.787875 i i think they're they're finally heading that direction uh you know because they now have some some cancer screening test
sw2850B-ms98-a-0034 145.787875 154.677750 that they will pay for so and they have also got the you know [prentative/preventative] preventative uh the well baby stuff which is good
sw2850B-ms98-a-0035 154.677750 157.285750 [silence]
sw2850B-ms98-a-0036 157.285750 158.693000 um-hum yeah

sw2850B-ms98-a-0040 167.992375 175.345750 yeah uh it's well like i say it it's slowly coming uh it's i guess it's just
sw2850B-ms98-a-0041 175.345750 184.527125 you know with insurance rates and medical cost being what they are i guess it's you know i i guess they're really trying to to hold the cost down
sw2850B-ms98-a-0042 184.527125 191.259500 yeah but it's it sure is hard becau[se]- i mean it's hard on the employee because you know the
sw2850B-ms98-a-0043 191.259500 203.761750 the cost are going up and the benefits are coming down you know they true they may be coming down at a slower rate because of the cost management things that they're doing but you know the benefits are coming down
sw2850B-ms98-a-0044 203.761750 207.423125 [silence]
sw2850B-ms98-a-0045 207.423125 219.291625 oh yeah now i yeah i love the CODA plan i [laughter] i haven't yet figured what the uh exactly what the uh catch is but i
sw2850B-ms98-a-0046 219.291625 222.630875 [silence]
sw2850B-ms98-a-0047 222.630875 224.205375 uh-huh

sw2850B-ms98-a-0050 227.555375 228.863875 yeah 
sw2850B-ms98-a-0051 228.863875 242.065375 yeah well i participate uh you know i've i have participated since they installed the plan but [laughter] uh for a long time i was leery about you know i just couldn't figure out well what's the deal you know why is the company doing that
sw2850B-ms98-a-0052 242.065375 244.497125 yeah that's true yeah
sw2850B-ms98-a-0053 244.497125 245.791375 [silence]
sw2850B-ms98-a-0054 245.791375 258.989000 um-hum and i guess i guess in a way that is the catch you know for the employee but it's also the benefit for the company because they have uh an amount of money there that that i suppose that they invest i don't know exactly what they do with that money
sw2850B-ms98-a-0055 258.989000 263.312500 but i'm sure they invest it some way and i'm sure they're making money off of it
sw2850B-ms98-a-0056 263.312500 264.600750 [silence]
sw2850B-ms98-a-0057 264.600750 272.087250 yeah uh-huh yeah it's it's great i like i say i use it and i'm i'm glad they came up with it [laughter]
sw2850B-ms98-a-0058 272.087250 273.797625 [silence]
sw2850B-ms98-a-0059 273.797625 276.053750 um-hum yeah

sw2850B-ms98-a-0061 278.417500 279.894375 um-hum
sw2850B-ms98-a-0062 279.894375 289.443750 yeah the TI does have some good benefits but like i say i r[eally]- i really do believe they strive just to kind of stay in the middle of the road as long as
sw2850B-ms98-a-0063 289.443750 299.266000 [silence]
sw2850B-ms98-a-0064 299.266000 310.088000 well [noise] yeah i guess i guess in a way they're they are they really are starting that now with the uh the smoker premiums that they're going to be starting
sw2850B-ms98-a-0065 310.088000 324.426125 so that's you know in a way and uh i'm just wondering you know how far it'll go over the years you know w[ill]- will they single out people who are susceptible to heart disease or overweight or or any other
sw2850B-ms98-a-0066 324.426125 329.196125 you know recognizable high risk i guess
sw2850B-ms98-a-0067 329.196125 338.305375 but you know that's i guess that's i guess that's the way it should be i i'm i'm not sure i[t]- it is it's different from the way it has been
sw2850B-ms98-a-0068 338.305375 340.729000 [silence]
sw2850B-ms98-a-0069 340.729000 353.652125 i don't know i'm i've wondered that myself i'm not a smoker so it's it's not going to affect me or my family but i you know we we've talked about it at work and wonder about that i guess you're just strictly on your honor i [laughter-guess] 
sw2850B-ms98-a-0070 353.652125 356.049125 [silence]
sw2850B-ms98-a-0071 356.049125 358.712125 oh yeah i did too [laughter]
sw2850B-ms98-a-0072 358.712125 361.140500 [silence]
sw2850B-ms98-a-0073 361.140500 366.603625 uh-huh yep yep
sw2850B-ms98-a-0074 366.603625 368.192125 [silence]
sw2850B-ms98-a-0075 368.192125 372.917750 well in a way i feel like uh you know the smokers should have to do that
sw2850B-ms98-a-0076 372.917750 387.769750 you know because they are bringing it on themselves even even though it is a habit that a lot of them_1 you know may have a problem quitting you know TI has seemingly bent over backwards to help them quit with the stop smoking programs
sw2850B-ms98-a-0077 387.769750 391.481875 [silence]
sw2850B-ms98-a-0078 391.481875 402.574875 yeah well like i say since i'm not a smoker i really don't know uh there there are quite a few guys in in my i work in a lab environment and there are quite a few guys in there who at one time did smoke and uh
sw2850B-ms98-a-0079 402.574875 414.142750 as a matter of fact all of them_1 have quit but they've all done it on their own none of them enrolled in any kind of program they just i guess just looked at the cold hard facts and just quit cold turkey
sw2850B-ms98-a-0080 414.142750 414.831500 [silence]
sw2850B-ms98-a-0081 414.831500 415.714625 yeah

sw2850B-ms98-a-0083 420.613500 422.007000 um-hum

sw2850B-ms98-a-0085 426.516500 437.457000 i i wouldn't be surprised uh i never had heard a number of how many actually signed up but i i do know that they were trying to get people to do it uh you know which is good because it is uh
sw2850B-ms98-a-0086 437.457000 448.574625 i guess more of a hardship on people who you know who are have been used to smoking in their work area just you know light one up whenever they want to and now they've got to get up and go to a designated area
sw2850B-ms98-a-0087 448.574625 460.217875 but that's uh times are changing you know as it has it's different now than what it was fifteen twenty years ago in in in the benefits and insurance and the whole works
sw2850B-ms98-a-0088 460.217875 464.086125 [silence]
sw2850B-ms98-a-0089 464.086125 465.929000 oh retirement
sw2850B-ms98-a-0090 465.929000 468.993500 [laughter] i mean i'm
sw2850B-ms98-a-0091 468.993500 479.986750 yeah well i'm i'm still a long way off but uh you know the retirement and profit sharing now profit sharing is really a sore spot with me because about the time that i hired in was ab[out]-
sw2850B-ms98-a-0092 479.986750 491.356000 about two years after i hired on was about the time that the uh the profit sharing plan changed over we went from the old plan to the new plan yeah and
sw2850B-ms98-a-0093 491.356000 502.686375 yeah oh yeah so you're you never were familiar with the old plan i don't guess well i you know i never participated in you know in the old plan because i uh didn't have enough uh vesting but uh
sw2850B-ms98-a-0094 502.686375 515.931875 i worked with a lot of old guys who really really got [laughter] were disappointed a[fter]- after the new plan had been in place for a few years they said it just was nothing like the old plan so
sw2850B-ms98-a-0095 515.931875 519.267625 [silence]
sw2850B-ms98-a-0096 519.267625 520.375875 uh-huh

sw2850B-ms98-a-0098 521.816625 524.589625 it really is it it's [laughter-it]
sw2850B-ms98-a-0099 524.589625 529.133250 yeah it's it's it's crazy i[t's]-

sw2850B-ms98-a-0103 533.745625 537.273625 [laughter] yeah that's [noise] that's kind of a
sw2850B-ms98-a-0104 537.273625 549.140125 [noise] um-hum oh that's that's kind of a standing joke that uh [laughter-a[nytime]-] anytime you see any big projects coming up you say well it must be getting close to time to figure profit sharing and it they're
sw2850B-ms98-a-0105 549.140125 550.552625 [silence]
sw2850B-ms98-a-0106 550.552625 559.185625 um-hum yeah it's it's well like i say your account e[ven]- even if you don't draw anything out of it is is just not even hardly worth the effort

sw2850B-ms98-a-0108 561.593625 564.821125 yeah i'm i'm likewise i[t]-
sw2850B-ms98-a-0109 564.821125 574.282000 uh you know i i think basically TI has without saying it is trying to tell you that hey we're not going to or not going to be able to
sw2850B-ms98-a-0110 574.282000 583.934875 take care of you at retirement so we're going to help you do what you can for yourself and you better take advantage of it if you want something to to look at

sw2850B-ms98-a-0112 592.740000 599.824125 yeah i i would hope uh well you know it is kind of rough on the people who uh
