sw2837B-ms98-a-0004 16.659125 28.909625 what we have here now is just a basic three bedroom two bath brick house which is uh completely different from what i had had before when i was working and before i married uh i lived in a little town
sw2837B-ms98-a-0005 28.909625 43.149000 south of here that is just full [noise] of old homes and uh historic old houses and things like that so i uh tried to i was in the process of renovating a house and uh that was about seventy five years old
sw2837B-ms98-a-0006 43.149000 53.137125 so um it had to have everything done from top to bottom to having it leveled jacked up um new plumbing new wiring
sw2837B-ms98-a-0007 53.137125 58.564250 wallpaper paint everything you can think of that house had to have [laughter]
sw2837B-ms98-a-0008 58.564250 69.703250 [laughter] well i i really did enjoy it uh you know it was amazing what i found out i could do on my own if i just put my mind to it yeah

sw2837B-ms98-a-0014 85.616500 95.084250 that's that's true when uh i met my husband he was living in an apartment at the time and and uh the town that i was living in only about eighty miles from here
sw2837B-ms98-a-0015 95.084250 105.728375 so um you know i we really it was just the market was so good we hadn't really planned on buying and as you probably heard from the in the Dallas and Texas area period
sw2837B-ms98-a-0016 105.728375 110.179125 the housing market is just unreal i mean you can get things for such a song
sw2837B-ms98-a-0017 110.179125 122.662625 so that's that's really why we ended up in a house like this his is not what we you know what we want to stay in forever because i have to have my i've found that after doing this other house i have to have my hands into stuff and
sw2837B-ms98-a-0018 122.662625 135.444375 you know i'm always just wanting to paint and and wallpaper and redo and redo so um you know i i'm ready to get ahold of another one that i can have a little more input into [laughter] so

sw2837B-ms98-a-0020 138.369125 144.220875 yeah that's that's the key you know the thing is uh when we moved in they had just
sw2837B-ms98-a-0021 144.220875 157.705625 um painted wallpa[pered]- we're you know wallpapered new carpet and everything so i feel sort of um you know like it's sort of defeating my purpose to go rip everything [laughter-out] [laughter-now] and do it over just because i'm in the mood to do it
sw2837B-ms98-a-0022 157.705625 161.596000 so uh we'll see we'll see how much longer we're here

sw2837B-ms98-a-0088 343.399750 356.163375 well let me ask you when you laid those bricks i know my parents bought a house about ten years ago they're fixing to sell it again but and move again they're kind of my mom's like i am she's a renovator a lover of old things
sw2837B-ms98-a-0089 356.163375 362.821750 and you know they have to be doing something constantly and the patio that came with that house um
sw2837B-ms98-a-0090 362.821750 376.561750 was not laid on a like i don't know if you can put some sort of a plastic sheeting or something un[der]- uh on top of the sand and then lay the bricks but they have they have a problem with these little tin[y]- like sand bugs or something
sw2837B-ms98-a-0091 376.561750 384.789375 that drill in between all these bricks and of course you know you have the uh the weeds that come up in between the bricks or and things like that

sw2837B-ms98-a-0116 462.213625 469.626875 in two days time sh[e]- they'll come home from work and those little things are back it's just they're the most resilient little characters
sw2837B-ms98-a-0117 469.626875 478.394125 and so i don't know what they're finally going to do she may just hopefully they'll sell the house and go somewhere [laughter-else] and then she won't have to worry about it

sw2837B-ms98-a-0127 509.468750 522.057625 um it might it might do it yeah she's got so many flow[er]- she's got just a gorgeous yard so many um flowers and her her four cats you know so she's sort of uh
sw2837B-ms98-a-0128 522.057625 525.304375 real funny about what she sprays

sw2837B-ms98-a-0133 547.067375 561.615000 but uh i don't know of everything that i did i guess i enjoyed probably wallpapering the most and i thought that would be the hardest thing to do but um gosh you know i ended up wallpapering every bedroom in that house
sw2837B-ms98-a-0134 561.615000 571.697000 um up up the stairway even you know i just had a ball with it it was so much fun yeah and i've sworn up and down my mom's um 
sw2837B-ms98-a-0135 571.697000 576.393000 my mom's great grandparents had this huge Victorian house in Paris Texas
sw2837B-ms98-a-0136 576.393000 584.247625 and the one thing that she ended up with is was the old door that was that was on the front door of that house
sw2837B-ms98-a-0137 584.247625 594.192625 and she has that up in her attic and i have sworn that it i'm going to find a house to put that door on before she [laughter-does] so as far as looking toward the future 
sw2837B-ms98-a-0138 594.192625 599.508000 you know that's my plan i'm going to have to move fast i think though because um you know as i s[aid]-
