sw2837A-ms98-a-0007 56.888125 60.249250 uh you are experienced i would say
sw2837A-ms98-a-0008 60.249250 67.355625 [silence]
sw2837A-ms98-a-0009 67.355625 74.587375 well i agree i have d[one]- done something uh like that too only not n[early]- nearly as extensive
sw2837A-ms98-a-0010 74.587375 83.848875 but it must be interesting now trying to do something to a basic ranch style home uh after having a
sw2837A-ms98-a-0011 83.848875 86.550625 one that was historical looking
sw2837A-ms98-a-0012 86.550625 109.318500 [silence]
sw2837A-ms98-a-0013 109.318500 110.744500 yes
sw2837A-ms98-a-0014 110.744500 121.939750 [silence]
sw2837A-ms98-a-0015 121.939750 123.158000 uh-huh
sw2837A-ms98-a-0016 123.158000 133.465750 [silence]
sw2837A-ms98-a-0017 133.465750 139.647000 well maybe you can uh make that one charming and and make a little bit money uh
sw2837A-ms98-a-0018 139.647000 158.660250 [silence]
sw2837A-ms98-a-0019 158.660250 160.265875 yes
sw2837A-ms98-a-0020 160.265875 164.819875 well we just moved to Charlotte from Enid Oklahoma
sw2837A-ms98-a-0021 164.819875 179.562250 so i know of what you're talking about as far as the market was concerned and i'll tell you uh we we had kind of a charming house it was a cedar shake house and very weathered and
sw2837A-ms98-a-0022 179.562250 184.343750 uh it was about fifty years old but not tra[ditional]- not really uh
sw2837A-ms98-a-0023 184.343750 187.300875 traditional looking particularly
sw2837A-ms98-a-0024 187.300875 196.619750 and uh so i tried to make it after i sold my business i in in i spent almost three years redoing
sw2837A-ms98-a-0025 196.619750 199.479000 and i considered it a full time job
sw2837A-ms98-a-0026 199.479000 209.094625 and when we did uh we kind of had planned this uh trek to the east because we're both originally from this part of the country
sw2837A-ms98-a-0027 209.094625 224.594125 and so i think some of the things that i did paid off for instance one thing that i did that might even be a good suggestion for you uh was something i did on the outside i love old estate estate sales
sw2837A-ms98-a-0028 224.594125 236.064125 i happened to go to just a little estate sale that just a little white frame house where the couple uh was very old and had gone into nursing homes and
sw2837A-ms98-a-0029 236.064125 241.093000 uh all the men started going down to the barn
sw2837A-ms98-a-0030 241.093000 244.069000 and so i though[t]- well shoot i'm going to
sw2837A-ms98-a-0031 244.069000 247.020000 yes i'm going to the barn too
sw2837A-ms98-a-0032 247.020000 255.011500 they uh auctioned some tools and things like that but then they went over and started uh
sw2837A-ms98-a-0033 255.011500 258.863500 auctioning this big stack of bricks
sw2837A-ms98-a-0034 258.863500 267.488500 and so well i thought gee i've been wanting to do some brick uh walkways for a time
sw2837A-ms98-a-0035 267.488500 275.610375 anyway it ended up after some pretty uh heavy bidding that i got all those bricks for forty dollars
sw2837A-ms98-a-0036 275.610375 283.604625 and so my husband and i loaded bricks in his pickup truck for days
sw2837A-ms98-a-0037 283.604625 288.188250 but what we ended up with was about four thousand
sw2837A-ms98-a-0038 288.188250 289.631125 [silence]
sw2837A-ms98-a-0039 289.631125 291.550250 for forty dollars
sw2837A-ms98-a-0040 291.550250 304.257625 and so what we did we had built a deck on the back of that house but it needed and it was quite large out to into the yard but on either side of it to the ends of the house
sw2837A-ms98-a-0041 304.257625 309.565375 it just needed to be all tied together so we made brick patios
sw2837A-ms98-a-0042 309.565375 312.386000 and walkways
sw2837A-ms98-a-0043 312.386000 327.223375 and so for and he he did the digging which was about six inches but i figured the sand and all had that delivered and leveled it and and placed most all the bricks
sw2837A-ms98-a-0044 327.223375 330.579875 and it turned out beautifully
sw2837A-ms98-a-0045 330.579875 334.896250 [silence]
sw2837A-ms98-a-0046 334.896250 337.643625 yes well it nearly killed me
sw2837A-ms98-a-0047 337.643625 339.228750 [laughter]
sw2837A-ms98-a-0048 339.228750 341.740875 [silence]
sw2837A-ms98-a-0049 341.740875 344.127625 i hated to leave it
sw2837A-ms98-a-0050 344.127625 355.399500 [silence]
sw2837A-ms98-a-0051 355.399500 356.805625 um-hum
sw2837A-ms98-a-0052 356.805625 370.179125 [silence]
sw2837A-ms98-a-0053 370.179125 372.053875 no we
sw2837A-ms98-a-0054 372.053875 376.001750 [silence]
sw2837A-ms98-a-0055 376.001750 377.520250 well i
sw2837A-ms98-a-0056 377.520250 382.714125 [silence]
sw2837A-ms98-a-0057 382.714125 387.732000 well no i i didn't have that trouble because um
sw2837A-ms98-a-0058 387.732000 402.408625 we laid the i did get some material [noise] and studied every bit of material that i could study but we laid those bricks about as close as you can get them because when you start and we put them on a base of four inches of s[and]- sand
sw2837A-ms98-a-0059 402.408625 415.605625 and then we uh we swept sand in between but but it was an error to to leave like an eighth of an inch or whatever you just put them together as close as you can
sw2837A-ms98-a-0060 415.605625 424.221250 [silence]
sw2837A-ms98-a-0061 424.221250 426.960625 um um-hum
sw2837A-ms98-a-0062 426.960625 429.183625 [silence]
sw2837A-ms98-a-0063 429.183625 439.644500 yeah well and i also used a rubber hammer a lot to um you know if it wasn't quite level or something i'd just get that rubber hammer and um
sw2837A-ms98-a-0064 439.644500 451.500625 and and prob[ably]- you know i think that they could if they have problems with uh sand bugs of some kind i think all they need to do is probably put some insecticide down in there on a
sw2837A-ms98-a-0065 451.500625 455.803875 oh a fairly regular basis for a while anyway
sw2837A-ms98-a-0066 455.803875 474.564750 [silence]
sw2837A-ms98-a-0067 474.564750 481.931375 [laughter] well i think sh[e]- i think she needs to take them to the extension agent and ask him what they are and
sw2837A-ms98-a-0068 481.931375 488.155000 yeah is it Diazinon or what is it that will uh Dursban or something like that
sw2837A-ms98-a-0069 488.155000 496.238250 Dursban i think in this area or most all areas they use you know for ticks and fleas and you know they're awful hard to do anything with
sw2837A-ms98-a-0070 496.238250 507.850750 [silence]
sw2837A-ms98-a-0071 507.850750 511.510375 yeah i bet Dursban would do it
sw2837A-ms98-a-0072 511.510375 523.376000 [silence]
sw2837A-ms98-a-0073 523.376000 533.202000 yeah i think uh you probably just need to make sure that it dries very very carefu[lly]- uh well before she lets her cats out or something like that
sw2837A-ms98-a-0074 533.202000 538.455875 well gosh Deb we could talk all day couldn't we [laughter]
