sw2803B-ms98-a-0003 32.478375 44.713375 that's true um-hum i agree with you in the sense that uh i think that it's important for people to uh also share give something of themselves
sw2803B-ms98-a-0004 44.713375 48.040125 and uh i think that there's too much
sw2803B-ms98-a-0005 48.040125 51.989750 in the in uh a way of like self-gratification today
sw2803B-ms98-a-0006 51.989750 54.442000 and there's not enough sharing

sw2803B-ms98-a-0018 107.130875 113.726750 uh you know in fact i saw an interview on TV the other night with uh Patrick Swayze and he's making a movie in
sw2803B-ms98-a-0019 113.726750 115.601125 i think it's uh
sw2803B-ms98-a-0020 115.601125 121.969750 Calcutta or either India somewhere where it's a it's a very poor poor country
sw2803B-ms98-a-0021 121.969750 124.872500 and he said that people in the West
sw2803B-ms98-a-0022 124.872500 133.948500 he said since being there and i guess he's been there about six months he said that his whole idea of what's important has changed
sw2803B-ms98-a-0023 133.948500 147.580750 and he said that people have no idea he said of of what human sacrifice is you know since being there he's he's learned to what it is to be poor and have nothing and yet those people have
sw2803B-ms98-a-0024 147.580750 150.753000 uh such uh a happy
sw2803B-ms98-a-0025 150.753000 160.928625 uh yeah in in other words they don't dwell on on what they don't have they dwell on what they do have and they're happy with each other type of thing
sw2803B-ms98-a-0026 160.928625 167.654250 and he said that out here he said that when he comes back he knows that it it's ju[st]- completely changed his life

sw2803B-ms98-a-0041 214.888250 218.867250 extraordinary things on TV that people have done
sw2803B-ms98-a-0042 218.867250 224.978625 working in the Peace Corps and how you know uh the people or the community they worked in is so much better
sw2803B-ms98-a-0043 224.978625 227.488125 it's like one person can make a difference
sw2803B-ms98-a-0044 227.488125 231.250625 and i- i really believe that they can in something like that

sw2803B-ms98-a-0061 271.707750 277.244000 it's true it really is it's the sad life i think today it's um
sw2803B-ms98-a-0062 277.244000 288.632250 it's it it's not like it used to be even in in the years of my growing up i mean i'm fifty three years old and i have seen a town change from a town to a city
sw2803B-ms98-a-0063 288.632250 294.397125 and it's uh people you know grow from a small town to a large town
sw2803B-ms98-a-0064 294.397125 304.422125 and you would think that more people would be better you know share more do more you know be more community oriented and all but if they just get more uh
sw2803B-ms98-a-0065 304.422125 306.787625 unto themselves kind of
sw2803B-ms98-a-0066 306.787625 311.754875 right and and it's not the sharing of uh a neighbor to a neighbor
sw2803B-ms98-a-0067 311.754875 314.789125 and [vocalized-noise] we would go out and not even lock our doors
sw2803B-ms98-a-0068 314.789125 317.164750 and not even worry about it
sw2803B-ms98-a-0069 317.164750 321.813000 but today i mean you know it's like you wouldn't even think of doing that
sw2803B-ms98-a-0070 321.813000 325.523125 if you don't have bars on the window you're not even safe you know

sw2803B-ms98-a-0079 345.472500 347.368125 in Dallas they
sw2803B-ms98-a-0080 347.368125 360.881000 i was going to say because_1 i- i heard uh in fact i was talking to someone from Dallas uh just last weekend they was saying that uh in fact it was this one girl particularly that worked for TI and she had gone overseas to Tokyo 
sw2803B-ms98-a-0081 360.881000 369.345500 and she asked them there if there was some anywhere that she shouldn't go because_1 she was alone you know being a girl from another country and everything
sw2803B-ms98-a-0082 369.345500 378.079875 and she said they thought for a few seconds and they said uh no there's nowhere that you can go that you would have to be afraid
sw2803B-ms98-a-0083 378.079875 381.936125 they said to her that even if she left her purse
sw2803B-ms98-a-0084 381.936125 384.030000 on the subway
sw2803B-ms98-a-0085 384.030000 388.162375 okay that she would have that purse returned to her
sw2803B-ms98-a-0086 388.162375 393.344625 this is how confident they were okay with nothing missing
sw2803B-ms98-a-0087 393.344625 396.671125 okay this is a foreign country
sw2803B-ms98-a-0088 396.671125 406.168750 and you would think you know uh being uh an American or whatever you know a foreigner there that that would be all the more reason that they'd take advantage of you
sw2803B-ms98-a-0089 406.168750 408.248875 okay
sw2803B-ms98-a-0090 408.248875 416.446250 and she told me she said she could tell them for fifteen minutes places not to go in in and around Dallas
sw2803B-ms98-a-0091 416.446250 418.754750 and that's where she was from
sw2803B-ms98-a-0092 418.754750 425.143375 she said even choosing her apartment she had to be so careful because of being a woman alone
sw2803B-ms98-a-0093 425.143375 427.751500 you know she had there are certain
sw2803B-ms98-a-0094 427.751500 430.686625 [silence]
sw2803B-ms98-a-0095 430.686625 432.159875 uh-huh

sw2803B-ms98-a-0097 435.186750 436.838125 oh yeah
sw2803B-ms98-a-0098 436.838125 443.609625 [silence]
sw2803B-ms98-a-0099 443.609625 445.469000 yeah

sw2803B-ms98-a-0101 450.440750 451.883125 yeah

sw2803B-ms98-a-0103 459.215625 460.603125 yeah
sw2803B-ms98-a-0104 460.603125 462.302750 yeah
sw2803B-ms98-a-0105 462.302750 463.434750 [silence]
sw2803B-ms98-a-0106 463.434750 464.897125 yeah
sw2803B-ms98-a-0107 464.897125 467.638625 [silence]
sw2803B-ms98-a-0108 467.638625 471.181750 and that that's why i think if people were more exposed to
sw2803B-ms98-a-0109 471.181750 475.051875 uh especially uh young kids getting out of high school
sw2803B-ms98-a-0110 475.051875 484.854500 i mean at one time they would go into the service to have the same exposure and you know uh to further their worldliness so to speak
sw2803B-ms98-a-0111 484.854500 494.060250 and go to see uh foreign countries that they would not necessarily be able to afford to see it was like they said join the Navy to see the world type of thing you know
sw2803B-ms98-a-0112 494.060250 502.225250 but nowadays they don't do that anymore it's not uh a thing uh a lot of young men don't even uh
sw2803B-ms98-a-0113 502.225250 504.963500 have the desire to go into the service
sw2803B-ms98-a-0114 504.963500 508.888125 or to uh you know do something for someone else
sw2803B-ms98-a-0115 508.888125 513.544500 and i don't know i- i attributed i think a lot of that to women working
sw2803B-ms98-a-0116 513.544500 516.363125 you know to the mothers not being at home 
sw2803B-ms98-a-0117 516.363125 518.891875 the bonding process yep
sw2803B-ms98-a-0118 518.891875 524.496000 [silence]
sw2803B-ms98-a-0119 524.496000 527.450750 it very definitely is
sw2803B-ms98-a-0120 527.450750 533.210750 [silence]
sw2803B-ms98-a-0121 533.210750 534.983125 that's right
sw2803B-ms98-a-0122 534.983125 540.507875 [silence]
sw2803B-ms98-a-0123 540.507875 541.534125 yep
sw2803B-ms98-a-0124 541.534125 546.169000 and the thing is like i think a man can afford to support a woman
sw2803B-ms98-a-0125 546.169000 549.369375 but the woman affords the luxuries
sw2803B-ms98-a-0126 549.369375 556.424375 in in other words like anyone can live on a a certain income no matter what it is you have to 
sw2803B-ms98-a-0127 556.424375 560.846500 so to speak okay it it's what's important to you
sw2803B-ms98-a-0128 560.846500 568.114500 now a family i- i think that like girls today have children and six weeks later they're back to work
sw2803B-ms98-a-0129 568.114500 572.612750 they don't even have a bonding with that child they don't eve[r]- ever see the
sw2803B-ms98-a-0130 572.612750 579.892250 it's it's the most beautiful thing that happens between a mother and a child the first like say six years of life
sw2803B-ms98-a-0131 579.892250 584.401125 so much happens in that period of time
sw2803B-ms98-a-0132 584.401125 589.997750 and i mean once the child's in school if you had a job from say nine to three
sw2803B-ms98-a-0133 589.997750 599.755000 big deal i mean th[ey're]- they're in school you're at work that's great but it's kids that come home and don't have a mother there or the kids are at home in the morning and the
