sw2891B-ms98-a-0009 51.681125 55.734250 so that we can kind of talk about it and decide whether it's really appropriate or
sw2891B-ms98-a-0010 55.734250 67.129125 you know or not and uh [noise] we're probably stricter than most parents i know we are because i know that my children's friends even the youngest ones routinely see things that

sw2891B-ms98-a-0051 226.951125 233.459125 that one was very unnerving for me i uh i have an American uh native American heritage and
sw2891B-ms98-a-0052 233.459125 235.905125 i knew going into it that it
sw2891B-ms98-a-0053 235.905125 238.261750 was probably going to affect me deeply

sw2891B-ms98-a-0059 276.336625 282.071625 it was cruelty to animals yes but not
sw2891B-ms98-a-0060 282.071625 284.953750 [vocalized-noise] kinds of things
sw2891B-ms98-a-0061 284.953750 286.444125 you know it was
sw2891B-ms98-a-0062 286.444125 288.508375 very much in the natural
sw2891B-ms98-a-0063 288.508375 292.708250 you know the way it really probably was not some sadistic
sw2891B-ms98-a-0064 292.708250 302.059000 crazed person you know who's going around pulling the wings off flies and birds [laughter] you know swinging cats by their tail k[ind]- not not that kind of 
sw2891B-ms98-a-0065 302.059000 306.209750 uh torturistic type thing you know it was
sw2891B-ms98-a-0066 306.209750 308.877250 but it it was awfully graphic
sw2891B-ms98-a-0067 308.877250 310.605625 that way but

sw2891B-ms98-a-0099 483.682000 492.477750 totally different you know kind of thing and even in that there were a few things that had i been making it i wouldn't have put in you know so [noise] but uh
