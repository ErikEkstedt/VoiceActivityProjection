sw2891A-ms98-a-0076 337.446250 339.624750 it's a David Lynch
sw2891A-ms98-a-0077 339.624750 342.568000 movie and it's about
sw2891A-ms98-a-0078 342.568000 348.601875 Sailor and Lula they're the two charac[ters]- main characters i can't remember the name of the film now
sw2891A-ms98-a-0079 348.601875 358.622625 but anyway got lots of just wonderful reviews and i had heard that it had violence in it but i thought well i'll go give it a try
sw2891A-ms98-a-0080 358.622625 366.809625 and the first five minutes of that movie were so disgusting that i went and got my money back
sw2891A-ms98-a-0081 366.809625 368.068750 [silence]
sw2891A-ms98-a-0082 368.068750 376.343500 i did i told my husband i've got a book in the car give me the car keys you can stay and watch this if you want to but i don't need this
sw2891A-ms98-a-0083 376.343500 386.806250 and i just got up and left and in about two more minutes he joined me and we asked for our money back i said you know i- i realize that this is advertised as an R movie
sw2891A-ms98-a-0084 386.806250 391.611750 and i had heard that it contained violence but i had no idea
sw2891A-ms98-a-0085 391.611750 402.968875 how disgusting this was going to be and in the five minutes i watched there was no let up it was it was just filthy
sw2891A-ms98-a-0086 402.968875 408.321250 and now i don't mind uh nudity and i don't mind
sw2891A-ms98-a-0087 408.321250 416.780625 suggestiveness if it's appropriate to the story i'm not a prude and i'm not a prig but i do not see any reason why
sw2891A-ms98-a-0088 416.780625 430.874375 you should have one string of filthy language with no intermission in it and uh graphic violence and blood and uh it total disregard for human beings
sw2891A-ms98-a-0089 430.874375 447.952375 [silence]

sw2891A-ms98-a-0111 513.825500 528.626250 there's a theater here in town that has uh been renovated by a foundation to its heyday of the twenties and it has the big old organ and everything and the big screen and they show only movies made before nineteen fifty
sw2891A-ms98-a-0112 528.626250 534.559625 and it is just great we go to that probably once a month or more
sw2891A-ms98-a-0113 534.559625 544.574750 uh at the very beginning when they were having film festivals like a Katherine Hepburn festival and a Fred Astaire festival and so on we were going a couple of nights a week
sw2891A-ms98-a-0114 544.574750 549.001000 [laughter] and it's great for one thing it's not
sw2891A-ms98-a-0115 549.001000 563.283125 well it's not full of rowdy teenagers who are uh spilling their Cokes and throwing their popcorn and talking all the time mostly middle age folks who are [laughter-pretty] [laughter-decorous] [laughter-and] sit still and listen to the film
sw2891A-ms98-a-0116 563.283125 574.637625 and they get these absolutely terrific prints that are from the uh film archives in Los Angeles that have ju[st]- been specially restored and sometimes they are made from the original negatives so they're really crisp and good
sw2891A-ms98-a-0117 574.637625 580.227750 so they're really crisp and good like they were when they first came out
sw2891A-ms98-a-0118 580.227750 589.873625 [silence]
sw2891A-ms98-a-0119 589.873625 598.428500 and you can go to a movie like that and you know that it's going to be entertaining and it's going to have some wit in the dialogue [vocalized-noise]
