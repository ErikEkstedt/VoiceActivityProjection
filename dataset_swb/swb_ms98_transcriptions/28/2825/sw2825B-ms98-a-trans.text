sw2825B-ms98-a-0005 22.657000 28.313750 get's to be a a real chore with little kids who basically want every thing covered in cheese

sw2825B-ms98-a-0030 191.745250 202.486750 [silence]
sw2825B-ms98-a-0031 202.486750 205.890000 now in Texas it would have to be ten fifteen
sw2825B-ms98-a-0032 205.890000 224.614500 [silence]
sw2825B-ms98-a-0033 224.614500 225.591125 uh
sw2825B-ms98-a-0034 225.591125 243.344750 [silence]
sw2825B-ms98-a-0035 243.344750 245.246000 God that sound wonderful
sw2825B-ms98-a-0036 245.246000 261.485625 [silence]
sw2825B-ms98-a-0037 261.485625 268.362375 well i'll give you one tha[t]- tha[t]- that that i put together modified out of a Heart Smart Cookbook
sw2825B-ms98-a-0038 268.362375 273.664375 now my husband really thinks that this is one of those Fren[ch]- fancy French sauces
sw2825B-ms98-a-0039 273.664375 279.209875 so when he [laughter] when he request this i always tell him he has to take the kids for an hour
sw2825B-ms98-a-0040 279.209875 286.865500 and it really only takes about fifteen or twenty minutes to do [laughter] but it gives me forty five minutes to sit by myself where it's quiet
sw2825B-ms98-a-0041 286.865500 295.016125 but what you do is you go take [noise] you can use pork tender loin it's more expensive but i and i like the leaner cut of pork
sw2825B-ms98-a-0042 295.016125 297.687625 the um like the center cut pork chops
sw2825B-ms98-a-0043 297.687625 302.997250 and you you need to have them thick at least a three-quarters of an inch think
sw2825B-ms98-a-0044 302.997250 307.454250 and all you do is take those things and coat them in lemon pepper marinade
sw2825B-ms98-a-0045 307.454250 308.462375 [silence]
sw2825B-ms98-a-0046 308.462375 309.959125 on both sides
sw2825B-ms98-a-0047 309.959125 313.178250 [silence]
sw2825B-ms98-a-0048 313.178250 319.885750 no just the uh the you know you can do that just the stuff that you buy just lemon pepper
sw2825B-ms98-a-0049 319.885750 323.268750 and then you take about two tablespoons of butter
sw2825B-ms98-a-0050 323.268750 329.123125 which you know most people kind of go [noise] you know this is a a low fat recipe but it is
sw2825B-ms98-a-0051 329.123125 331.997625 and you just melt that in a skillet
sw2825B-ms98-a-0052 331.997625 338.250750 you brown the uh the pork chops or the pork fillets
sw2825B-ms98-a-0053 338.250750 341.727250 you just brown them on both sides and i like to get them at a good golden brown
sw2825B-ms98-a-0054 341.727250 352.794250 and then just take them and stick them on a plate and keep them warm and into that same skillet add the juice of lemon about anywhere from a quarter to a half a cup
sw2825B-ms98-a-0055 352.794250 358.301875 to that you add two tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce
sw2825B-ms98-a-0056 358.301875 362.545125 and one teaspoon to a tablespoon depending on how much you like it
sw2825B-ms98-a-0057 362.545125 363.484375 uh
sw2825B-ms98-a-0058 363.484375 364.920750 [silence]
sw2825B-ms98-a-0059 364.920750 366.511375 yeah Worcestershire
sw2825B-ms98-a-0060 366.511375 368.317125 and then
sw2825B-ms98-a-0061 368.317125 372.115250 anywhere from a teaspoon to a tablespoon of Dijon mustard
sw2825B-ms98-a-0062 372.115250 373.132000 [silence]
sw2825B-ms98-a-0063 373.132000 380.953625 and what you do is you just cook this down and it makes a a a really pretty almost dark black brown viscous sauce
sw2825B-ms98-a-0064 380.953625 385.361375 it's pretty spicy now i like to throw in just a you know a shot of white wine
sw2825B-ms98-a-0065 385.361375 392.278875 and then you just take the pork chops put them on a serving platter pour this sauce over it and i garnish it with fresh cut chives
sw2825B-ms98-a-0066 392.278875 396.969875 it really is a really pretty entree to look at
sw2825B-ms98-a-0067 396.969875 404.991250 uh-huh and the sauce i mean it has kind of this nice complex flavor where you feel that somebody's you know played around with this all afternoon
sw2825B-ms98-a-0068 404.991250 407.700625 and i have served it to company
sw2825B-ms98-a-0069 407.700625 408.389875 and
sw2825B-ms98-a-0070 408.389875 410.613625 [silence]
sw2825B-ms98-a-0071 410.613625 411.355750 uh-huh
sw2825B-ms98-a-0072 411.355750 415.836875 but you know the trick with pork most people think you have to cook it at a hundred and eighty five degrees well done
sw2825B-ms98-a-0073 415.836875 417.808500 you don't have to do that
sw2825B-ms98-a-0074 417.808500 422.277500 it can still be pink in the middle and that makes all the world of difference
sw2825B-ms98-a-0075 422.277500 428.603250 the other thing that that i've really got into down here in Texas is ah fresh herbs
sw2825B-ms98-a-0076 428.603250 430.951875 [silence]
sw2825B-ms98-a-0077 430.951875 432.504875 oh yeah
sw2825B-ms98-a-0078 432.504875 433.895250 [silence]
sw2825B-ms98-a-0079 433.895250 439.677250 well see i don't have to try them cause they'll they'll pretty much you know grow all winter long and if
sw2825B-ms98-a-0080 439.677250 444.059125 oh i don't know we also have you know foot long roaches all year long too
sw2825B-ms98-a-0081 444.059125 446.457875 [laughter] hey don't laugh
sw2825B-ms98-a-0082 446.457875 457.176625 don't laugh but what makes a really elegant um just a side dish and most people don't have any idea what it is why they don't i don't know and you can make it a day ahead of time
sw2825B-ms98-a-0083 457.176625 461.953000 because_1 i just take about a cup of fresh cut basil i mean i really like basil
sw2825B-ms98-a-0084 461.953000 469.965500 and then cook spaghetti and i th[e]- [vocalized-noise] this is smaller thread spaghetti it's like the cappelletti probably is the better
sw2825B-ms98-a-0085 469.965500 475.180750 add and i add almost equal parts parmesan cheese
sw2825B-ms98-a-0086 475.180750 479.488625 a a a healthy balance of garlic i mean i really like garlic
sw2825B-ms98-a-0087 479.488625 480.643625 [silence]
sw2825B-ms98-a-0088 480.643625 484.652625 yeah so you're basically making a kind of a a pesto
sw2825B-ms98-a-0089 484.652625 490.628125 yes but if you serve it cold it really is just a wonderful
sw2825B-ms98-a-0090 490.628125 499.398625 uh-huh uh-huh and pine nuts and if you can't get pine nuts [vocalized-noise] because_1 to me they're always kind of mushy i just grind up walnuts and use that in it 
sw2825B-ms98-a-0091 499.398625 501.353625 it really is nice
sw2825B-ms98-a-0092 501.353625 502.862875 [silence]
sw2825B-ms98-a-0093 502.862875 505.074125 and even my kids will eat it
sw2825B-ms98-a-0094 505.074125 506.103250 [silence]
sw2825B-ms98-a-0095 506.103250 509.577500 and they've gotten to be kind of food snobs one of them went over to
sw2825B-ms98-a-0096 509.577500 519.641375 [silence]
sw2825B-ms98-a-0097 519.641375 522.401750 dry basil doesn't have quite the taste
sw2825B-ms98-a-0098 522.401750 524.254000 [silence]
sw2825B-ms98-a-0099 524.254000 528.919500 yeah i keep i do that and i find that it tastes just about as good
sw2825B-ms98-a-0100 528.919500 533.758250 and i freeze it in like little half cup quantity so i can even pull it out whenever i want to
sw2825B-ms98-a-0101 533.758250 536.215375 [silence]
sw2825B-ms98-a-0102 536.215375 547.333000 [vocalized-noise] you'll be surprised you'll be really surprised at just how simple it is and and it's not a a clear cut you know this this this and this it's kind of to taste
sw2825B-ms98-a-0103 547.333000 564.293750 [silence]
sw2825B-ms98-a-0104 564.293750 565.758625 uh-huh
sw2825B-ms98-a-0105 565.758625 571.169375 you know what also is really good just really really good and really really simple if you like to do grilling
sw2825B-ms98-a-0106 571.169375 574.248000 if you can get a hold of fresh sage
sw2825B-ms98-a-0107 574.248000 576.179125 have you ever worked with that
sw2825B-ms98-a-0108 576.179125 579.526375 just take the fresh sage and and you know
sw2825B-ms98-a-0109 579.526375 583.234500 crumble it so that you you release the oils
sw2825B-ms98-a-0110 583.234500 586.279000 pour you know put that stuff over fresh pork chops
sw2825B-ms98-a-0111 586.279000 589.364125 and if you've got balsamic vinegar there
