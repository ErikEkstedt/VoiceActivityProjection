sw2816A-ms98-a-0004 31.345375 36.244500 [laughter] so it was unsatisfactory completely [laughter]
sw2816A-ms98-a-0005 36.244500 38.749250 oh my isn't that interesting
sw2816A-ms98-a-0006 38.749250 53.860125 [silence]
sw2816A-ms98-a-0007 53.860125 55.332125 um-hum
sw2816A-ms98-a-0008 55.332125 58.178375 [silence]
sw2816A-ms98-a-0009 58.178375 59.658625 yeah
sw2816A-ms98-a-0010 59.658625 60.671500 [silence]
sw2816A-ms98-a-0011 60.671500 62.262500 right
sw2816A-ms98-a-0012 62.262500 68.905250 there there really isn't any substitute for mothers [laughter-is] [laughter-there] [laughter] when you get right down to it yeah
sw2816A-ms98-a-0013 68.905250 78.679750 [silence]
sw2816A-ms98-a-0014 78.679750 85.722750 no in fact very bad i think that is the thing that it scares everybody to death because
sw2816A-ms98-a-0015 85.722750 87.483125 right
sw2816A-ms98-a-0016 87.483125 100.172500 [silence]
sw2816A-ms98-a-0017 100.172500 101.882875 um-hum
sw2816A-ms98-a-0018 101.882875 103.485625 [silence]
sw2816A-ms98-a-0019 103.485625 113.697875 i think maybe when you talk about the criteria that's the one thing is to is to somehow get to know well enough what where you're putting this child
sw2816A-ms98-a-0020 113.697875 122.909000 and if you know your child well then then you know whether this is going to work sometimes some of these things work out well uh uh interesting enough my daughter 
sw2816A-ms98-a-0021 122.909000 131.772125 uh just started working in uh in a day care center she needed to go to work and she has two little boys one's about uh
sw2816A-ms98-a-0022 131.772125 136.760125 uh almost five and the other's almost three and uh
sw2816A-ms98-a-0023 136.760125 148.487125 uh they were driving her [laughter-crazy] [laughter-i] [laughter-guess] [laughter-they] [laughter-were] never busy enough you know she couldn't ever do enough things to keep them_1 uh away from the television and uh and that sort of thing
sw2816A-ms98-a-0024 148.487125 162.824000 and uh so but she looked at places to work for a long time before she finally chose one tha[t]- that she said she could she could not have been comfortable in any of the others because uh this one's kind of laid back a little bit you know
sw2816A-ms98-a-0025 162.824000 171.256000 it kind of flows with the children like her children play in another area but they're welcome to come and sit on her lap anytime they feel like it
sw2816A-ms98-a-0026 171.256000 185.068000 and uh and she can go by and wave at them_1 you know and talk to them_1 and visit with them_1 and she gets this feeling of uh of uh intermingling with them and yet they get the activity of the other children which they seem to need at this point
sw2816A-ms98-a-0027 185.068000 187.763625 [silence]
sw2816A-ms98-a-0028 187.763625 189.054250 uh-huh
sw2816A-ms98-a-0029 189.054250 190.100500 uh
sw2816A-ms98-a-0030 190.100500 191.298250 [silence]
sw2816A-ms98-a-0031 191.298250 200.404125 yes there's a lot of times when you need some of that but the idea of of having nothing else is what's uh unfortunate yeah
sw2816A-ms98-a-0032 200.404125 206.850500 [silence]
sw2816A-ms98-a-0033 206.850500 208.207625 uh-huh

sw2816A-ms98-a-0037 214.524375 215.779750 um-hum
sw2816A-ms98-a-0038 215.779750 217.867250 no that's right sometimes
sw2816A-ms98-a-0039 217.867250 225.414000 [silence]
sw2816A-ms98-a-0040 225.414000 232.366500 yeah it's very difficult costs so much that you can't hardly afford to work wh[en]- even though you have to yeah
sw2816A-ms98-a-0041 232.366500 234.241750 [silence]
sw2816A-ms98-a-0042 234.241750 235.636375 yeah
sw2816A-ms98-a-0043 235.636375 242.871500 and in some ways i[t]- rightly so you know it's a sad thing that uh
sw2816A-ms98-a-0044 242.871500 247.976750 that you you realize the child care if it's done right
sw2816A-ms98-a-0045 247.976750 257.088000 is [laughter-probably] [laughter-the] [laughter-most] demanding job in the [laughter-world] and if they really are good at it you're [laughter-you're] probably not paying them_1 any too much
sw2816A-ms98-a-0046 257.088000 266.385625 and yet and yet it's uh you can't get something else to do i guess uh that's probably the reason Sheila felt like going that direction i had a uh
sw2816A-ms98-a-0047 266.385625 276.293875 niece that stayed here too that uh uh they were here for about six months with their two two little girls and uh
sw2816A-ms98-a-0048 276.293875 288.997625 uh she took in children here at my [laughter-house] [laughter-while] she was here uh you know not many like three others and uh uh we have a big house so it wasn't a problem and she
sw2816A-ms98-a-0049 288.997625 296.948000 uh but it was kind of an interest[ing]- it was interesting watching her you know her interaction with the children she didn't do anything else all day she just
sw2816A-ms98-a-0050 296.948000 304.423125 sat and played and intermingled with them_1 you know and read to them_1 and change their pants and fed them_1 and a[nd]- moved them_1 from one [laughter-thing] [laughter-to] [laughter-another]
sw2816A-ms98-a-0051 304.423125 307.436625 but that's what you do you just ha[ve]-

sw2816A-ms98-a-0071 353.346000 356.645375 that's true that's true
sw2816A-ms98-a-0072 356.645375 361.494000 [silence]
sw2816A-ms98-a-0073 361.494000 365.569000 i think so too i think that's the answer
sw2816A-ms98-a-0074 365.569000 377.919750 i think it's got to come through the work place where they where uh uh a parent can take a child and and maybe even have an area an isolation area where children who are ill can be there
sw2816A-ms98-a-0075 377.919750 385.722000 and uh uh you know if there not too ill and and uh and a parent can go and do her work and there is somebody there that can do it
sw2816A-ms98-a-0076 385.722000 398.092750 think of how many jobs they would supply people who are not trained to do other kinds of things and with the right kind of supervision you know if you had somebody who su[pervise]- who really knows what she's doing supervise other people
sw2816A-ms98-a-0077 398.092750 403.311000 you could really go a long ways to alleviating some of the problems that people have
sw2816A-ms98-a-0078 403.311000 407.655500 yeah so well it's been great talking to you
sw2816A-ms98-a-0079 407.655500 409.471500 right
