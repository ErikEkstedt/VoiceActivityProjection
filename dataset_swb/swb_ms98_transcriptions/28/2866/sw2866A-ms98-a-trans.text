sw2866A-ms98-a-0020 62.943875 76.561500 yeah i thought so too it was it you know for a while when we were really interested uh we saw it all the time some of the stations i guess carried it for twenty four hours for a couple of days there and then you know the special reports
sw2866A-ms98-a-0021 76.561500 79.804000 and the extended news coverage i thought was really good

sw2866A-ms98-a-0039 134.924875 146.516750 that's um i've found that when i i don't have cable television anymore uh when i moved went back to graduate school i just didn't have the money to buy ge[t]- rent a cable TV line or whatever you know so i don't get CNN
sw2866A-ms98-a-0040 146.516750 150.956375 uh which was a big disappointment i used to watch that was my if i
sw2866A-ms98-a-0041 150.956375 162.692250 wasn't home i'm a college teacher and sometimes i teach in the evening so i'll miss the evening news and uh you could always catch a good news program at eight o'clock or nine o'clock on CNN i think that's
sw2866A-ms98-a-0042 162.692250 166.339125 that really has changed the way um i look at the news

sw2866A-ms98-a-0051 192.328125 199.675375 and uh because uh i i don't drive that much i only live about a mile from where i go to school and work i uh
sw2866A-ms98-a-0052 199.675375 204.768000 i find i spend so little time in the ra[dio]- in the car that i don't really listen to the radio

sw2866A-ms98-a-0062 233.321375 246.416750 yeah i can the van pools i know that i know i'm in the Baltimore Washington area and i know they do van pool a lot here from some of the outer areas but if you want a nicer home you know beyond the suburbs you know i that's necessary 
sw2866A-ms98-a-0063 246.416750 247.850000 yeah
sw2866A-ms98-a-0064 247.850000 259.234875 i am i am right outside Baltimore i am less than a mile from the Baltimore line and i go to a bl[ock]- a campus of the University of Maryland that is just less than a mile from my house
sw2866A-ms98-a-0065 259.234875 263.371500 so i i'm actually in Baltimore yeah you could say i'm in Baltimore
sw2866A-ms98-a-0066 263.371500 264.458500 [silence]
sw2866A-ms98-a-0067 264.458500 266.532250 oh really in Baltimore
sw2866A-ms98-a-0068 266.532250 268.189500 uh-huh
sw2866A-ms98-a-0069 268.189500 279.175125 [silence]
sw2866A-ms98-a-0070 279.175125 280.938750 uh-huh oh that's
sw2866A-ms98-a-0071 280.938750 295.201500 th[at's]- that's uh -[th]at's a really nice area Bethesda area uh-huh it's um it's funny there's a big difference between Baltimore and Washington even though they're so close there's only an hour less than that between the two but there is a big difference in things like property values 
sw2866A-ms98-a-0072 295.201500 299.466500 and um the closer you get to Washington DC the more expensive it is 
sw2866A-ms98-a-0073 299.466500 300.827375 an um
sw2866A-ms98-a-0074 300.827375 305.356000 the uh the different slant Washington it really is a uh 
sw2866A-ms98-a-0075 305.356000 307.997750 uh an international city
sw2866A-ms98-a-0076 307.997750 317.878625 where Baltimore is hometown Baltimore you know it there's really uh most people have relocated to the Washington area [laughter] you know
sw2866A-ms98-a-0077 317.878625 319.319875 [silence]
sw2866A-ms98-a-0078 319.319875 332.970500 yeah that's i i like it i like it a little bit better too it's interesting though um to meet different populations i i'm just now being uh from Pittsburgh originally i'm just now meeting different populations like Chinese students and things
sw2866A-ms98-a-0079 332.970500 344.571625 and i find that really interesting you know to imagine here is somebody that was in China l[ast]- two years ago when all that was going on in in uh Beijing you know that that's an interesting uh
sw2866A-ms98-a-0080 344.571625 349.783625 interesting perspective but i i really much much like the hometown area yeah
sw2866A-ms98-a-0081 349.783625 358.043250 and i think that also goes it's funny you you can watch different news i can watch Washington news or Baltimore news and i really do watch Baltimore news
sw2866A-ms98-a-0082 358.043250 366.873000 you know that really makes i don't really bother with the Washington station because i just it's so far removed from what i'm interested in
sw2866A-ms98-a-0083 366.873000 372.679125 [silence]
sw2866A-ms98-a-0084 372.679125 382.346875 uh-huh yeah they in fact they just it was just a big thing recently they've had some terrible problems with Hispanics um they had to impose a curfew
sw2866A-ms98-a-0085 382.346875 388.439250 that uh in two of the areas in uh in the Washington suburbs the mayor they've gotten rid of that
sw2866A-ms98-a-0086 388.439250 395.950125 really bad mayor and then in uh brought in a yeah and then came a woman that's um she's big in the Democratic party 
sw2866A-ms98-a-0087 395.950125 401.999375 so that's good so she has good national ties but she also was um
sw2866A-ms98-a-0088 401.999375 409.227750 something like a [noise] uh state auditor or something like that before this position she was a state auditor
sw2866A-ms98-a-0089 409.227750 421.697875 i guess she was an auditor general or something like that for the District of Columbia at Washington and then she left that to get a position with the Democratic party and now she ran for mayor so she's uh fiscally she's pretty tight
sw2866A-ms98-a-0090 421.697875 434.562000 and uh she's cleaning house an and it looks like hopefully she'll do a nice job uh for Washington you know which is you sort of feel sorry for a lot of the people there you know from what i pick up on the news uh
sw2866A-ms98-a-0091 434.562000 439.151750 it's a difficult process you know to get rid of a a bad mayor
sw2866A-ms98-a-0092 439.151750 442.487875 [silence]
sw2866A-ms98-a-0093 442.487875 445.887750 right uh-huh yeah
