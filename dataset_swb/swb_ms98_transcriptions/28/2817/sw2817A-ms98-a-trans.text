sw2817A-ms98-a-0049 370.321750 374.901250 that's uh you know i hope if my my mother ever gets
sw2817A-ms98-a-0050 374.901250 381.606500 to the point where she can't take care of the home herself that she would consider uh the apartment type
sw2817A-ms98-a-0051 381.606500 392.846500 setting you know from what i've seen with my gran[dmother]- grandmother who passed away i don't know maybe ten or twelve years ago they had her in a setting like that where she was responsible to
sw2817A-ms98-a-0052 392.846500 401.150125 go to they had dinner in the cafeteria and she had her own little room it wasn't like she didn't have a stove or anything in her own apartment
sw2817A-ms98-a-0053 401.150125 410.892500 yeah but you know she could walk to walk to the dinner hall and had games and stuff so it was sort of like a step between a
sw2817A-ms98-a-0054 410.892500 422.749250 nursing home and a uh you know just a a retirement village or whatever they're called those so i guess there's different levels you just have to be sure and match your loved one with that

sw2817A-ms98-a-0067 477.012375 481.410625 yeah yeah i i guess i'm a big advocate of um
sw2817A-ms98-a-0068 481.410625 493.549000 decreased morbidity which is where the elderly person through i don't know a healthier lifestyle and exercise and eating right can
