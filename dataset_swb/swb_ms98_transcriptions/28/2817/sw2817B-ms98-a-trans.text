sw2817B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 2.700000 [silence]
sw2817B-ms98-a-0002 2.700000 5.815375 well i certainly um can
sw2817B-ms98-a-0003 5.815375 18.020750 appreciate the patience and the you know energy and money and time and effort it re[quire]- would require for someone to you know take care of their elderly parent or whatever in their home
sw2817B-ms98-a-0004 18.020750 24.744750 uh i think that you know would definitely be preferable if the person is
sw2817B-ms98-a-0005 24.744750 39.269875 you know able t[o]- able to do that i think sometimes people take on i know i have one friend who is taken on more than she can handle you know with her her mom just needing constant supervision and for one person to be able to cope with that you know is really
sw2817B-ms98-a-0006 39.269875 52.770250 difficult but i know it's hard to not to feel guilty you know to put somebody in a nursing home i if i suppose if you could find a nursing home that you thought really comfortable you know that they were getting adequate care but i think that's probably pretty hard to do at times
sw2817B-ms98-a-0007 52.770250 59.768625 i've not ever been put put in this position i personally would have a real hard time taking care of my father [laughter]
sw2817B-ms98-a-0008 59.768625 69.267125 [noise] he's getting up there but he's very difficult to live with and i think that would be a real consideration in in um entering him into our family unit here you know
sw2817B-ms98-a-0009 69.267125 71.726250 so there's a lot of factors involved
sw2817B-ms98-a-0010 71.726250 77.441500 [silence]
sw2817B-ms98-a-0011 77.441500 89.914375 well i think i would you know in some ways have to decide how much personally you know i was able and willing to handle and how much it would affect you know the rest of my family because i have two small children
sw2817B-ms98-a-0012 89.914375 95.640125 and um we don't have a real large house if you had a lot of money and you were able to
sw2817B-ms98-a-0013 95.640125 105.904250 you know have like a little separate wing or something where i wouldn't have to constantly be having my children you know be quiet and go away and that kind of thing to accommodate an elderly person
sw2817B-ms98-a-0014 105.904250 119.428875 i think you know just the medical aspects too would be a big question how much um it would require you know in terms of nursing care at home and i know that there is uh often times insurance companies won't even pay
sw2817B-ms98-a-0015 119.428875 127.532875 you know and if they took families for doing things if if they were in a nursing home would cost you know a hundred times more so that's
sw2817B-ms98-a-0016 127.532875 137.781125 that's a consideration too but i don't know it'd be it would be a really rough choice to make you know depending on the parent their personality and you know your own family and what's going on with
sw2817B-ms98-a-0017 137.781125 147.199875 i'm home all day anyway right now with young kids but if i was working you know full time and had to give up a career that would be another you know problem too but
sw2817B-ms98-a-0018 147.199875 159.779500 um the only people i've seen is my husband's uh grandmother has been in a nursing home for several years i know that uh there's been a lot of questions from other family members as to whether she's getting enough attention and
sw2817B-ms98-a-0019 159.779500 166.755750 whether they just kind of let her sit there and roll her over once in a while it it's really tragic to go in those places you know
sw2817B-ms98-a-0020 166.755750 169.264250 so [noise] i don't know
sw2817B-ms98-a-0021 169.264250 170.622375 [silence]
sw2817B-ms98-a-0022 170.622375 174.042500 um i think i would uh
sw2817B-ms98-a-0023 174.042500 183.448625 look for a place that definitely had the physical attributes and it wasn't a sterile kind of environment but had a comfortable feeling to it that respected uh
sw2817B-ms98-a-0024 183.448625 187.501000 that you seem to see some respect for peoples privacy and
sw2817B-ms98-a-0025 187.501000 198.405000 the attitude that the staff would have towards the patients and i was at uh visiting a friend in the hospital and there was a nurse screaming at an older man who was there was a head injury unit and he had apparently
sw2817B-ms98-a-0026 198.405000 206.049250 wet his pants and they had a blanket draped over him and the blanket had either fallen to the floor or he had dropped it on the floor and the nurse was just screaming at him about how
sw2817B-ms98-a-0027 206.049250 219.905000 obscene that was or something [laughter-and] [laughter-i] [laughter-just] [laughter-thought] gosh if i walked into a place and i saw a staff member just berating or humil[iating]- humiliating a patient i would definitely that would be something i'd really want to be on the look out for um
sw2817B-ms98-a-0028 219.905000 229.699125 i would hope that they would have uh you know some you consistent staff i know they don't pay that much in a lot of those places and so there's probably a lot of turnover that'd be another thing that would be
sw2817B-ms98-a-0029 229.699125 241.439000 you know something to be important because i think it's confusing particularly if people are in some state of you know mental confusion anyway to have constant new people on staff and having to develop new relationships and
sw2817B-ms98-a-0030 241.439000 242.627625 [silence]
sw2817B-ms98-a-0031 242.627625 246.602250 oh i don't know what else other than that maybe some place that
sw2817B-ms98-a-0032 246.602250 259.891000 had activities you know that they could participate in instead of just kind of like sitting there watching the wall [laughter-or] [laughter-something] [laughter-you] [laughter-know] talking to other people who had family members there you know see how responsive the staff was to
sw2817B-ms98-a-0033 259.891000 264.734625 the things i brought up you know that i thought were important for my family member
sw2817B-ms98-a-0034 264.734625 269.673250 it it would really be hard because when we go to visit i'm sure that places have you know their best
sw2817B-ms98-a-0035 269.673250 280.624125 foot forward kind of thing unless you drop in frequently and kind of get the since of what's going on behind the scenes it w[ould]- really would be hard to know it's kind of similar in away to some of the things you look for in going to try and find day care for your kids
sw2817B-ms98-a-0036 280.624125 291.873625 you know so uh i'm sure that if you have enough money you can find just super care but you know the cost of this probably just horrendous
sw2817B-ms98-a-0037 291.873625 301.037250 [silence]
sw2817B-ms98-a-0038 301.037250 311.857625 yeah i think that would be great i- i had wished often um with my husband's grandmother that she had been in a place like that because she had lived alone in an upper story of an apartment building away from even
sw2817B-ms98-a-0039 311.857625 318.266500 friends not really close by her or a grocery store or anything and i thought she could have lived a a lot longer if she had been
sw2817B-ms98-a-0040 318.266500 331.473625 in a place where she didn't have to climb up and down the stairs haul groceries and then she would have people to check on her and didn't have to cook because she just got to a point where she wouldn't cook just for herself and then she fell down and nobody knew about it for hours and hours and hours and
sw2817B-ms98-a-0041 331.473625 342.552125 so i think that would be great if if you know if i had to choose a place for myself that's definitely why i think that kind of atmosphere would be wonderful even i recall where i was living in the college dormitory as a graduate student
sw2817B-ms98-a-0042 342.552125 355.596625 i thought how how neat you know that you can have a place where you can you know go down together and have dinner with other people because if your living alone the isolation and the depression and all those other factors should be taken into consideration too
sw2817B-ms98-a-0043 355.596625 369.314375 so i thought you know they should have dorms for older people they had activities going on all the time [laughter-and] [laughter-you] [laughter-know] it was really a much more comfortable lifestyle i could imagine for an older person so yeah i think that would be great if they had places like that
sw2817B-ms98-a-0044 369.314375 371.142000 yeah
sw2817B-ms98-a-0045 371.142000 377.356625 [silence]
sw2817B-ms98-a-0046 377.356625 378.889875 um-hum

sw2817B-ms98-a-0050 399.085375 402.187500 yeah they had their own privacy yeah

sw2817B-ms98-a-0052 405.474500 406.620625 um-hum

sw2817B-ms98-a-0056 421.848125 429.718375 yeah yeah i don't know you know how many of those there are but um you know i definitely think it's a great idea to have that kind of thing
sw2817B-ms98-a-0057 429.718375 441.779250 you know for people i know that um in that way too that sometimes the elderly can be more involved with their families they can have their grandkids or [vocalized-noise] you know that kind of thing over to spend the night or there's a lot more freedom i think 
sw2817B-ms98-a-0058 441.779250 447.928875 instead of just being kind of taken away from all of that and told where you're going to be and what you're going to do in a nursing home
sw2817B-ms98-a-0059 447.928875 449.165250 so
sw2817B-ms98-a-0060 449.165250 459.034750 [silence]
sw2817B-ms98-a-0061 459.034750 461.074750 yeah yeah

sw2817B-ms98-a-0064 467.608500 470.602250 let's hope it's true
sw2817B-ms98-a-0065 470.602250 479.403750 it is i've i've had had a lot of uh thought thought provoking conversations [laughter-on] [laughter-all] [laughter-the] topics [laughter] [vocalized-noise] 
sw2817B-ms98-a-0066 479.403750 490.189875 [silence]

sw2817B-ms98-a-0069 496.578750 508.278000 right right well as the insurance companies get more into this preventative health care i think that will help it just seems very slow that that [laughter-happening] but yeah i definitely think that will help
sw2817B-ms98-a-0070 508.278000 514.989250 [silence]
sw2817B-ms98-a-0071 514.989250 517.289500 yeah yeah
