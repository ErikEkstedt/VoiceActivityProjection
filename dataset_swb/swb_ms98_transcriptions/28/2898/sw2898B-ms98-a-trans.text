sw2898B-ms98-a-0018 67.391875 75.918875 their best player this years you know averaged twenty points a game they had to make him sit the bench and actually kicked him off the team because_1 um
sw2898B-ms98-a-0019 75.918875 89.549625 his uh grades even though they passed Big Ten standings and they passed you know NC double A they weren't they did not pass um Purdue requirements and so

sw2898B-ms98-a-0023 97.506750 103.108375 a[nd]- and so um you know their very best player they probably lost over half their games because_1
sw2898B-ms98-a-0024 103.108375 109.610875 you know by tw[enty]- twenty points was what he averaged um and so you know he had to sit
sw2898B-ms98-a-0025 109.610875 118.281125 you know he was kicked off the team and then they've got three players top you know recruiting class this year that are going to have to be
sw2898B-ms98-a-0026 118.281125 132.111000 well the the prep school they go to before they can play because_1 they aren't [laughter-smart] [laughter-enough] you know it's just sad because i mean Purdue even though they're one of the few schools that really uh
sw2898B-ms98-a-0027 132.111000 137.616000 stress academics they're r[eally]- suffering you know and

sw2898B-ms98-a-0049 239.885125 249.123750 and it was so funny to watch them play against the other teams because_1 it was like they played so much smarter and more disciplined i don't know if they won very many games but
sw2898B-ms98-a-0050 249.123750 255.119625 i don't know their style of play was so much different from some of the teams that just run and gun
