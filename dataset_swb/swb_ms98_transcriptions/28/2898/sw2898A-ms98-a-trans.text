sw2898A-ms98-a-0008 25.999750 30.521500 and all the teams uh since we're supposed to talk about specific teams
sw2898A-ms98-a-0009 30.521500 33.120375 i'd like to see them_1 turn back to 
sw2898A-ms98-a-0010 33.120375 47.692125 where the college player plays for four years and they're not they're not semi pro and just go on and are stolen by the the N[BA]- the the League you know in three years plus i'd like to see them_1 to be true athletes where they're they're taking a regular
sw2898A-ms98-a-0011 47.692125 59.285125 college course you know i'd like to see they didn't ask that but they're talking about college teams i you know since you're being you can talk for hours go ahead y[ou]- you you if you like sports go right ahead with this one
sw2898A-ms98-a-0012 59.285125 70.103125 [silence]

sw2898A-ms98-a-0015 87.971500 92.460500 now that's surprising that they uh that they have better requirements that's good
sw2898A-ms98-a-0016 92.460500 95.555500 that's what i like to see go ahead i'm all for that
sw2898A-ms98-a-0017 95.555500 97.013625 [silence]
sw2898A-ms98-a-0018 97.013625 98.446250 that's great

sw2898A-ms98-a-0022 125.334375 137.340375 [silence]
sw2898A-ms98-a-0023 137.340375 142.148000 oh i i agree i i think that that there's a lot of inconsistencies uh
sw2898A-ms98-a-0024 142.148000 154.423875 uh when some conference uh players come from outside of Texas you know and and play us here uh they're obviously pl[us]- practicing sixty hours a week you know and and there's no consistency seems to me
sw2898A-ms98-a-0025 154.423875 163.229750 that like Purdue uh uh when they're trying a student athlete is spending so many hours in class he only has twenty twenty five whatever hours he has
sw2898A-ms98-a-0026 163.229750 175.342000 to spend on practice he should be playing they all should be playing another team that that has about twenty hours to practice a week but uh y[ou]- there are teams that practices sixty hours a week they're not going to class at all
sw2898A-ms98-a-0027 175.342000 181.113500 i mean tha[t's]- that's what i mean by semi pro there's too many semi pros in college and and i think they ought to get rid of that
sw2898A-ms98-a-0028 181.113500 189.191500 [silence]
sw2898A-ms98-a-0029 189.191500 199.446625 well i'm all for i'm all for the oh baseball has a uh a uh minor league system and i think that the football and basketball they asked us to talk about basketball
sw2898A-ms98-a-0030 199.446625 210.611125 should you know le[t]- let them_1 go have a semi pro team but i think i'd like to see college athletes let's talk about college basketball i like i like that if any basketball that i like i like that i i don't i don't like the pros at all
sw2898A-ms98-a-0031 210.611125 219.668000 uh the high scoring there's no defense it seems like and they just kind of score a hundred and twenty five points you know the other team scores hundred twenty two you know and i don't really
sw2898A-ms98-a-0032 219.668000 222.089500 uh get much out of that
sw2898A-ms98-a-0033 222.089500 228.146750 [silence]
sw2898A-ms98-a-0034 228.146750 229.760000 um-hum

sw2898A-ms98-a-0046 254.624250 266.980500 yeah i like high school football which a[gain]- again i[s]- is not the subject but that's so much fun to watch because th[ey're]- they're the the pure amateurs you know and there's no money involved you go to college you don't really know i[t]- it loses it somewhere
sw2898A-ms98-a-0047 266.980500 273.529000 uh whatever sport it is if they're really pu[tting]- putting a lot of money in these players let's face it ninety percent are being paid
sw2898A-ms98-a-0048 273.529000 287.140875 so i'd like to see college basketball and all the other sports go back to being amateurs i i don't care about seeing the best players in the world play i like to see uh the people going to Texas just play and the ones that are in class and and like to see athletes uh
sw2898A-ms98-a-0049 287.140875 301.286750 uh or s[tudents]- s[tudents]- fellow students like myself you know to to play the game i i in fact i like amateur sports i- i don't i don't see it has to be i don't think that college f[ootball]- football and i'm or or basketball should have to be semi pro you know 
sw2898A-ms98-a-0050 301.286750 307.545000 i wish it'd return to the to good old days of the amateur and everybody play that's what i like everybody should play you know
sw2898A-ms98-a-0051 307.545000 314.571000 [silence]
sw2898A-ms98-a-0052 314.571000 325.985625 yeah well again i'd just like to see the the true athlete the s[tudent]- t[rue]- t[rue]- true student athlete play basketball you know i don't like to see the ones that aren't have no intention of going to class uh
sw2898A-ms98-a-0053 325.985625 327.049625 [silence]
sw2898A-ms98-a-0054 327.049625 330.550625 you know and again just picking a school uh Texas uh is
sw2898A-ms98-a-0055 330.550625 339.400250 is usually not the best team you know because the other teams are i'm sure practice a lot more and uh SMU down here
sw2898A-ms98-a-0056 339.400250 345.978625 i[n]- in footballs been trying to get back uh to having true s[tudent]- s[tudent]- student athletes and and that's what i think is a lot of fun
sw2898A-ms98-a-0057 345.978625 348.447125 [silence]
sw2898A-ms98-a-0058 348.447125 350.740875 to win and g[et]- and money yeah
sw2898A-ms98-a-0059 350.740875 353.604875 [silence]
sw2898A-ms98-a-0060 353.604875 354.946500 um-hum

sw2898A-ms98-a-0062 359.638125 362.682875 yeah i always thought that co[llege]- university
sw2898A-ms98-a-0063 362.682875 373.116375 was t[o]- t[o]- for an education and then s[ports]- sports of course is part of the education i don't think that sports has to make a lot of money or you do away with it i don't know why they don't keep fencing and all that you know and
sw2898A-ms98-a-0064 373.116375 387.098625 and and they seem to be there's articles in the Time magazine and all that about whether it be basketball or anything else if it's not making money then we'll do away with it well th[at's]- that's not i thought it was you know so that you give them an education of that particular discipline
sw2898A-ms98-a-0065 387.098625 392.841375 and i and i i just think that amateur sports should stay in universities that's where it's at
sw2898A-ms98-a-0066 392.841375 403.909875 and i i'm sure saddened to see i think it was Wisconsin or somewhere they were getting rid of fencing and a couple of other things i don't know what it was and it just seems so sad to have to only rely on
sw2898A-ms98-a-0067 403.909875 411.085625 you know college football is that all they're going to have to make money you know plus i didn't think that was the objective was to make money but it seems like it is

sw2898A-ms98-a-0094 500.057250 511.894250 well my office mate here Earl he he goes to all the Maverick games and he loves that he he would be this would be great question for him uh to talk about basket[ball]- like he's got i'm looking at his calendar he's got all over the place uh
sw2898A-ms98-a-0095 511.894250 521.297500 and he goes to a lot of the Maverick games and everything and but i i i can't get interested at all zero i i listen to him and occasionally i'll watch them_1 on channel eleven
sw2898A-ms98-a-0096 521.297500 531.131500 but uh gee i can't uh more than five minutes of a basketball game just seems about that's it of uh uh pro anyway uh of

sw2898A-ms98-a-0103 545.828500 552.311375 yeah i'm surprised a little bit when you're talking about basketball how some players work and Mavericks had
sw2898A-ms98-a-0104 552.311375 560.403250 oh two players this year that they got rid of last year i'll think of them_1 in a minute Perkins Sam Perkins can't think of the other one they're both
sw2898A-ms98-a-0105 560.403250 567.970875 pardon me yeah Tarpley and they both left this past year and both of them_1 were on were on play-off teams uh
sw2898A-ms98-a-0106 567.970875 572.655625 so th[ey]- they benefitted tremendously by by leaving the Mavericks
sw2898A-ms98-a-0107 572.655625 574.833750 and Sam Perkins here uh
sw2898A-ms98-a-0108 574.833750 584.834125 he's one guy i did follow from think he was in Virginia i can't think of what school he went to but from i guess he's been here about five six seven years in the pros
sw2898A-ms98-a-0109 584.834125 593.397500 and he was he never quite achieved the you know the super stardom that he had in i[n]- in college but uh
sw2898A-ms98-a-0110 593.397500 599.980875 basketball they have a nice i don't know if you've been down to the sports for Reunion Arena it's really a nice uh certainly the
