sw2805B-ms98-a-0002 7.334625 12.568000 well there are several things that we've done as a family um
sw2805B-ms98-a-0003 12.568000 24.808250 as far as uh when we go on vacation we have four children [noise] and so it's difficult sometimes for us to afford the hotel all the time
sw2805B-ms98-a-0004 24.808250 30.659250 and so we take our tent and we pitch it and our kids are just great at camping my husband and my son are scouts
sw2805B-ms98-a-0005 30.659250 44.528625 [noise] and are very adept at that kind of thing and so it makes it a successful thing you know we just pitch the tent and we find the campgrounds that have facilities which is really nice because there are a lot of them across the United States now
sw2805B-ms98-a-0006 44.528625 46.040000 and um
sw2805B-ms98-a-0007 46.040000 53.690125 [noise] and uh uh like i said our kids are just really good and we have a four year old and even he's not any big problem with it
