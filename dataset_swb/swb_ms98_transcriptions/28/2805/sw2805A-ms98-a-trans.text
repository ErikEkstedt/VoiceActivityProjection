sw2805A-ms98-a-0023 94.849875 106.045000 our first uh first camping experience was uh the fathers took the the uh Webelows i guess it was camping uh and we went over to uh a lake over in East Texas
sw2805A-ms98-a-0024 106.045000 111.200375 and w[e]- my son and i borrowed a one of these pop up trailer tents
sw2805A-ms98-a-0025 111.200375 117.293500 and it rained it started raining about the time we left home and it rained
sw2805A-ms98-a-0026 117.293500 127.072875 uh like that was a Saturday morning and it rained all day Saturday and it was still raining Sunday morning we went over and set up camp and you know stayed there over night
sw2805A-ms98-a-0027 127.072875 133.151000 we couldn't do anything so as soon as we woke up Sunday morning we you know we had breakfast and then we all came back home
sw2805A-ms98-a-0028 133.151000 137.747250 but i think he and i were the only ones that stayed high and dry so to [laughter-speak]
sw2805A-ms98-a-0029 137.747250 138.897750 but uh
sw2805A-ms98-a-0030 138.897750 150.351625 most of the most of our camping experiences have been you know pup tent type of you know little two men tents on the ground and sleeping in a bed roll you know and that kind of thing so it's uh

sw2805A-ms98-a-0037 185.924500 194.206000 right yeah you need to be on higher ground sometime you don't want the if th[ere]- if it's going to rain you don't want the water to run down into your tents so
sw2805A-ms98-a-0038 194.206000 206.607375 but uh yeah we had we've had some really good experiences i[t]- it's been several years since i've been camping but uh as a matter of fact my son uh is camping now he camps every weekend he
sw2805A-ms98-a-0039 206.607375 216.235250 he's uh involved with the uh Scarborough Fair down at Waxahachie and he goes down there on uh Sa[turday]- on uh Friday night
sw2805A-ms98-a-0040 216.235250 222.967000 and camps and stays uh Friday night and Saturday night and then comes back home after it closes Sunday
sw2805A-ms98-a-0041 222.967000 233.424875 so he has a tent that's i guess he's got a permanent tent site for his tent stays down there all week you know and he just goes down and spends the weekend down there
sw2805A-ms98-a-0042 233.424875 246.449875 so he's really having a good time camping and and you know his experiences that he got from scouting have really you know been good for him uh from that he he lost interest in scouts but he still uses what he learned so
