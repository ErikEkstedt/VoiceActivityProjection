sw2802A-ms98-a-0005 4.763875 9.517625 well i- i definitely think it's our the cars we drive and
sw2802A-ms98-a-0006 9.517625 16.854375 i think you know everyone has good intentions and and thinks well i should carpool and i will and but
sw2802A-ms98-a-0007 16.854375 28.047000 that we just have so many different interests and so many different things we have to do it's it's a bother to have to pick somebody up and if you have a doctor's appointment or something and they have to get another ride home or
sw2802A-ms98-a-0008 28.047000 33.211875 you have to arrange it's just a hassle and i guess we're not willing to do that
sw2802A-ms98-a-0009 33.211875 38.978375 but that to me is probably the thing that needs to be done or to start using public
sw2802A-ms98-a-0010 38.978375 41.936250 D[allas]- Dallas area i live in Plano
sw2802A-ms98-a-0011 41.936250 45.970875 which is just a a suburb of of Dallas do you live in a major city

sw2802A-ms98-a-0016 52.077375 60.699625 well myself i- i go to Richardson which is a i teach school and so i don't [vocalized-noise] commute that far it's only about four miles but
sw2802A-ms98-a-0017 60.699625 66.611625 the majority of people that live in this area go into Dallas to work and and
sw2802A-ms98-a-0018 66.611625 72.529500 when you if you go out on the freeway and you look you see almost every car is just one passenger
sw2802A-ms98-a-0019 72.529500 87.402500 and our public transportation system's a joke so people just don't bother to take that because it's inconvenient we don't have any kind of a a train or uh you know anything like some of the big cities do
sw2802A-ms98-a-0020 87.402500 91.203375 we're supposed to get one but it's you know way off in the future
sw2802A-ms98-a-0021 91.203375 92.197000 but
sw2802A-ms98-a-0022 92.197000 94.062375 no it's just it

sw2802A-ms98-a-0035 132.037500 144.033625 see that's yeah that isn't even i mean i'm not sure that a pers[on]- even a [laughter-percentage] of of of people in the Dallas area ride bikes to work you know i just don't think they do i never see anybody 
sw2802A-ms98-a-0036 144.033625 145.669500 um
sw2802A-ms98-a-0037 145.669500 156.159125 another thing that that i think our my family's real conscious of is is is to stop using aerosol cans and you know uh you know get an[other]- find another way instead of
sw2802A-ms98-a-0038 156.159125 157.670000 you know the pump
sw2802A-ms98-a-0039 157.670000 158.679500 [silence]
sw2802A-ms98-a-0040 158.679500 160.472625 i know it really is and
sw2802A-ms98-a-0041 160.472625 169.401625 we just need not to buy the stuff and those businesses will have to change you know the corporations and so forth have to change if you don't buy it they're not going to make it so
sw2802A-ms98-a-0042 169.401625 171.131000 yeah that is an easy one
sw2802A-ms98-a-0043 171.131000 176.920250 but uh you know and i notice probably a lot of uh commercial pollution and
sw2802A-ms98-a-0044 176.920250 180.975125 and factory pollution in Dallas you can see it some days it's really bad
sw2802A-ms98-a-0045 180.975125 182.114750 [silence]
sw2802A-ms98-a-0046 182.114750 190.562625 yeah it's yeah it's awful it's nothing like California where the smog is constant but it's still there and you know it
sw2802A-ms98-a-0047 190.562625 203.959000 if we i think if we really realized how much we do breathe in that's unhealthy we would immediately do something about it but i don't think people realize how unhealthy the the air is

sw2802A-ms98-a-0051 210.768625 218.122500 well i think i don't see i only teach English and and uh but the science teacher i teach fifth grade and we're departmentalized and
sw2802A-ms98-a-0052 218.122500 224.110000 the science teacher does a really big unit on it and i think the kids are more informed than adults are i mean and

sw2802A-ms98-a-0059 238.947125 248.332250 they do they do and they and and i think that they are they care a little bit more and i think as adults we need to care because it's the the future for our kids and i
sw2802A-ms98-a-0060 248.332250 256.801625 you know i mean my kids are much more aware than i was at their age about things like that and i think it's it's definitely has to be that
sw2802A-ms98-a-0061 256.801625 263.591625 no it really wasn't it wasn't a problem it i mean it pro[bably]- i'm sure it was beginning to be a problem but people were just weren't
sw2802A-ms98-a-0062 263.591625 277.980125 uh aware of it like they are today and i think that's where it has to start with the kids because it's going to be their world soon and i think it and and we're real big on you know Plano which is a small suburb of Dallas about a hundred thousand
sw2802A-ms98-a-0063 277.980125 288.208625 um i think we're more than that about a hundred thirty thousand now but um they're really trying their best to start recycling and things like that that will
sw2802A-ms98-a-0064 288.208625 300.627000 and we just we have separate garbage collections now for plastics and cans and newspaper and which i think is i mean that's that should be just a way of life for everybody you shouldn't even complain about it you should just do it

sw2802A-ms98-a-0069 312.898500 315.358500 you're right you're right
sw2802A-ms98-a-0070 315.358500 317.013125 [silence]
sw2802A-ms98-a-0071 317.013125 323.126750 well you know it just has to be when you consider the landfills we we're not going to have any soon and it's
sw2802A-ms98-a-0072 323.126750 336.629000 it's ridiculous but the thing that the quandary that i'm in is that that we had a great big article in in in the newspaper last week about i've been real big about going to to the store and asking for paper instead of plastic well 
sw2802A-ms98-a-0073 336.629000 343.588500 that is really controversial because some scientists you know feel like plastic i mean paper is worse than plastic
sw2802A-ms98-a-0074 343.588500 353.561625 it's just it's just a real um debate about which one is is the best really the best thing to do is to bring um you know a cloth bag yeah
sw2802A-ms98-a-0075 353.561625 355.290000 do you
sw2802A-ms98-a-0076 355.290000 358.040125 yeah i see that's what i do too i forget and
sw2802A-ms98-a-0077 358.040125 369.433375 and besides when i go to the store i have a family you know i- i get maybe ten twelve bags of groceries and that would be a little [laughter] a little expensive although you know i'm sure some

sw2802A-ms98-a-0088 407.808000 409.846125 well you know and they say that
sw2802A-ms98-a-0089 409.846125 414.476000 you know plastic is recyclable but not many people use them_1 again you know
sw2802A-ms98-a-0090 414.476000 417.298625 [silence]
sw2802A-ms98-a-0091 417.298625 419.034000 yeah that's true
sw2802A-ms98-a-0092 419.034000 420.330000 [silence]
sw2802A-ms98-a-0093 420.330000 422.086500 sure sure
sw2802A-ms98-a-0094 422.086500 431.253625 i think that you know i think that it's tremendous the research they're doing on all of this because i think we need to to know and be more aware of it so we can do some changing but
sw2802A-ms98-a-0095 431.253625 443.304625 the majority of people are so lazy about it that they're not willing to to sacrifice a little to to make the world a better place and it's kind of sad because especially_1 if you have children and because_1 you know you want [vocalized-noise] 
sw2802A-ms98-a-0096 443.304625 446.669625 your kids and their kids to to be able to
sw2802A-ms98-a-0097 446.669625 457.969250 be a part of a yeah a world that's halfway decent and you know just in my lifetime i've seen such a change in the environment and it's scary because by the time my kids have kids
sw2802A-ms98-a-0098 457.969250 463.250625 and they're growing up it's going to be a completely different world you know and it's it's scary so
sw2802A-ms98-a-0099 463.250625 474.109125 you know like i- i know that i need to carpool and i don't and uh and i you rationalize and say well i only am four miles away and that it's no big deal and
sw2802A-ms98-a-0100 474.109125 476.310875 well you know but
sw2802A-ms98-a-0101 476.310875 482.680500 [silence]
sw2802A-ms98-a-0102 482.680500 484.690875 [laughter]

sw2802A-ms98-a-0104 487.893000 490.259125 right right
sw2802A-ms98-a-0105 490.259125 497.628500 well you know just yeah just with with our thing in Plano it had w[hen]- recycling garbage it hasn't
sw2802A-ms98-a-0106 497.628500 506.368625 it hasn't been that long and it was just uh really an easy adjustment for most people but there was a f[ew]- small percentage that griped and complained and wrote
sw2802A-ms98-a-0107 506.368625 513.458250 you know letters to the editor and you know like it was some real great big deal inconvenience and
sw2802A-ms98-a-0108 513.458250 520.530250 but it seems to me you should just be able to give up a little bit to make the world better but some people don't think that so
sw2802A-ms98-a-0109 520.530250 530.750375 and some people don't and some people i think really believe and maybe they're rationalizing but they really believe that everybody's making a bigger deal out of the problem than it is
sw2802A-ms98-a-0110 530.750375 534.753000 and that and that it's right no way it's it's there and we've got to face it
sw2802A-ms98-a-0111 534.753000 537.085750 [vocalized-noise] 
sw2802A-ms98-a-0112 537.085750 540.268500 that's right i think in some cases they aren't
sw2802A-ms98-a-0113 540.268500 545.672375 and i see i wonder h[ow]- i wonder how much the laws
sw2802A-ms98-a-0114 545.672375 551.302625 that Congress passed several years ago are really enforced as far as big companies and
sw2802A-ms98-a-0115 551.302625 554.296250 [silence]
sw2802A-ms98-a-0116 554.296250 562.374625 oh i think so too and i think that they're not fined the way they should be or they're they pay them_1 off or whatever so they can get away with it
sw2802A-ms98-a-0117 562.374625 573.021250 i- i was born in Ohio and when um when i was young we d[id]- we did a lot of fishing and on Lake Erie and i [noise] i mean when i went back
sw2802A-ms98-a-0118 573.021250 586.121375 i just couldn't believe the difference it's just terrible the way it's polluted because of of big corporations that dump and and you know and you just feel so bad because at one time it was a wonderful beautiful lake and now it's a mess 
sw2802A-ms98-a-0119 586.121375 589.124750 [silence]
sw2802A-ms98-a-0120 589.124750 595.805625 yeah i [vocalized-noise] when i was little my dad [vocalized-noise] had a boat and we would go fishing on Lake Erie and it was beautiful 
sw2802A-ms98-a-0121 595.805625 599.812000 and [laughter] it's not beautiful anymore so and that's
