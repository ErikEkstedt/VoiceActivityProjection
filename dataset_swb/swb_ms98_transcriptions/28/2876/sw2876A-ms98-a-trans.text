sw2876A-ms98-a-0025 88.823250 100.841875 not all that many it wasn't very well advertised but recently uh the refuse department has has uh is working on getting a system going where we will actually have uh
sw2876A-ms98-a-0026 100.841875 105.884750 a bend that we put things in for recycling these other things
sw2876A-ms98-a-0027 105.884750 114.379125 so it it should be good uh i think it's a marvelous idea when you think of uh when i just think of the papers that i dump out
sw2876A-ms98-a-0028 114.379125 119.089000 i mean there just it's such a i waste i just hate to think about it

sw2876A-ms98-a-0045 149.147625 150.156875 [silence]
sw2876A-ms98-a-0046 150.156875 157.991625 yeah that's right i guess one of the things i think that needs to happen is we need to be better informed about
sw2876A-ms98-a-0047 157.991625 170.949375 about it there's needs to be more public uh service of programs or something that would let us know had a happens to it and helps us to become enthused about it because of what is happening
sw2876A-ms98-a-0048 170.949375 182.504625 and there's i've seen a few things but not very much really and i- i think that's a shame they need to do a little more i'd like to know for instance when i when they say uh plastic
sw2876A-ms98-a-0049 182.504625 194.146750 all plastic what kind of plastic can you put all together or is there some reason not to uh now maybe they just sort it after they get it and throw out what they can't use i don't know
sw2876A-ms98-a-0050 194.146750 196.487500 but i i'd be glad to
sw2876A-ms98-a-0051 196.487500 200.155000 organize it [laughter] if that they'd tell me what it is i'm doing
sw2876A-ms98-a-0052 200.155000 203.322625 because i think that would that would be really helpful
sw2876A-ms98-a-0053 203.322625 204.804250 uh
sw2876A-ms98-a-0054 204.804250 217.240000 [silence]

sw2876A-ms98-a-0060 224.556750 228.417250 now that gives you a little bit of incentive there uh-hum
sw2876A-ms98-a-0061 228.417250 236.642375 [silence]
sw2876A-ms98-a-0062 236.642375 239.358250 saving them for you huh [laughter]

sw2876A-ms98-a-0066 245.388625 255.642000 i think that's right i think i think helping us be more enthusi[astic]- enthusiastic about it helping us maybe maybe using the money for something special that would be
sw2876A-ms98-a-0067 255.642000 262.732875 like paying off the national [laughter-debt] [laughter]
sw2876A-ms98-a-0068 262.732875 266.287875 making sure [vocalized-noise] [laughter]
sw2876A-ms98-a-0069 266.287875 272.621875 [noise] but i- i think that's right i think they there needs to be a little bit more in the area of of uh
sw2876A-ms98-a-0070 272.621875 285.880875 ad[vertisement]- advertisement and [vocalized-noise] letting public letting you understand more of what it is you're doing why you're doing it how you're it's done and what what happens to it because i think that's that would help a lot
sw2876A-ms98-a-0071 285.880875 288.510875 [silence]
sw2876A-ms98-a-0072 288.510875 289.938625 yeah

sw2876A-ms98-a-0076 296.672875 301.469000 yes i- i i'm glad to see some of these things i think
sw2876A-ms98-a-0077 301.469000 303.286500 [silence]
sw2876A-ms98-a-0078 303.286500 308.621375 people are becoming more conscious all the time that it's really necessary to do and that we need to
sw2876A-ms98-a-0079 308.621375 315.576125 somehow get away from the fact that we have to have everything individually wrapped and all these things that i think that's true
sw2876A-ms98-a-0080 315.576125 321.448125 well i think i'm that's about my uh [laughter] some on recycling but i- i enjoyed talking to you
