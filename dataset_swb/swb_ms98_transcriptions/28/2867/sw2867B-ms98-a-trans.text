sw2867B-ms98-a-0010 65.324000 75.126500 no no i come from a family of hunters and and lots of brothers i have five brothers and and they've all hunted and and
sw2867B-ms98-a-0011 75.126500 81.503625 my uh in fact i didn't ever e[ven]- hardly ever even eat beef until i was about five or six years old as
sw2867B-ms98-a-0012 81.503625 91.102125 my daddy's theory was if you hunt it you better eat it until it's gone and then you go to the grocery store and buy what you need and so we always ate venison and it's still just about my favorite meat
sw2867B-ms98-a-0013 91.102125 98.977125 and my husband has bow hunted through the years as well as uh hunt with a gun but pretty much now our theory is
sw2867B-ms98-a-0014 98.977125 112.054000 you know we'll shoot with a camera unless we need to we you know we both know how to hunt and take care of meat if that occasion should ever arise for our family and we own guns we really have not uh
sw2867B-ms98-a-0015 112.054000 113.266250 [noise]
sw2867B-ms98-a-0016 113.266250 125.967625 [noise] this isn't just really great hunting country [laughter-i] [laughter-mean] you know there's not a lot of access you almost have to go like to an indoor range or something to to be able for your children to learn gun safety
sw2867B-ms98-a-0017 125.967625 134.149625 in a safe situation because you ass[ume]- have to assume in my mind that anyplace that's out far enough where you could shoot
sw2867B-ms98-a-0018 134.149625 144.705250 somebody else can [laughter-be] [laughter-out] [laughter-there] [laughter-plinking] [laughter-at] [laughter-you] and your kids you know i've never allowed my boys to have BB guns which by the time my brothers were my sons' ages
sw2867B-ms98-a-0019 144.705250 158.760250 you know they had plenty of BB guns and used them and everything on you know and it was kind of that you know same kind of theory then you know that uh if you shot it you better f[igure]- figure out a way to bring it home and eat it or better not ever let mother know that
sw2867B-ms98-a-0020 158.760250 165.079375 you know that you were out you know indiscriminately taking out birds or squirrels or whatever
sw2867B-ms98-a-0021 165.079375 166.125750 [silence]
sw2867B-ms98-a-0022 166.125750 172.888125 but on the other hand we've eaten a lot of raccoon and possum and [laughter-turtle] [laughter-all] [laughter-kinds] [laughter-of]
sw2867B-ms98-a-0023 172.888125 184.276875 all my i have a little grandmother in Oklahoma and you know that's she'll cook anything if you bring it in and you know that's and so my brothers would always hunt those things and
sw2867B-ms98-a-0024 184.276875 196.904000 you know we're a little more but o[n]- on the other hand i i don't have a whole lot of patience with people who who don't want to talk about that kind of the end of animals and yet they're more than willing to go up to Skaggs or you know
sw2867B-ms98-a-0025 196.904000 203.886125 Kroger or whatever and buy their chicken and their meat and come home and cook it And you start talking about hunting and they just cringe and
sw2867B-ms98-a-0026 203.886125 212.200125 you know ooh you know i i i don't go for that you know i that to me is the other end of the coin that's hiding your head in the sand
sw2867B-ms98-a-0027 212.200125 224.105625 you know i i have a respect for life and for meat i eat it sparingly but when i eat it i know that you know some[thing]- something had to die for [laughter-it] [laughter-so] even if it was in a butcher lot

sw2867B-ms98-a-0037 278.779000 282.715250 or a little child i mean think of the times we've seen
sw2867B-ms98-a-0038 282.715250 287.972500 you know a c[riminal]- a criminal element is kind of out of my realm i mean personally
sw2867B-ms98-a-0039 287.972500 296.905875 you know i i don't i don't have anybody in my family's ever gone to jail i i've never [laughter] known anybody personally who used a gun against themselves or
sw2867B-ms98-a-0040 296.905875 306.385875 you know or or someone else exc[ept]- well i guess i have in a couple of cases of suicide but still that's not exactly the criminal element that i think of as
sw2867B-ms98-a-0041 306.385875 310.522000 you know what i am saying go down to the local 7-Eleven and
sw2867B-ms98-a-0042 310.522000 333.911375 [silence]
sw2867B-ms98-a-0043 333.911375 342.400500 and and i understand that these magazines you know and whatnot that cater to that crowd are very uh you know the mercenary kinds of
sw2867B-ms98-a-0044 342.400500 351.696250 things i can't think of some of the names right off but i've heard them that they're just replete with advertisements for these really uh
sw2867B-ms98-a-0045 351.696250 358.321125 militarily sophisticated types of weapon[s]- mercenary type things is what i think of
sw2867B-ms98-a-0046 358.321125 364.343000 [silence]
sw2867B-ms98-a-0047 364.343000 366.822375 and targets yeah yeah

sw2867B-ms98-a-0049 393.849125 404.622000 well there used to be uh i grew up in Irving we live in Plano now there used to quite a few along the Trinity River Bottom and whatnot that you could go to and out in Euless and uh
sw2867B-ms98-a-0050 404.622000 414.508500 area uh um out off one fifty seven and you know those are just [es/extinct] extinct now not even available you know they've been built up so much around it's no longer

sw2867B-ms98-a-0054 433.933625 444.240625 and yet you know i would think that a practice shooting range the kind of people that it would generate is the last place you probably really have a problem with guns
sw2867B-ms98-a-0055 444.240625 447.229625 [silence]
sw2867B-ms98-a-0056 447.229625 449.551625 but it's a nice thought you [laughter-know]

sw2867B-ms98-a-0073 525.047250 537.045250 um-hum um-hum see there's scout camps and whatnot but once again you know they don't run a range you know that uh but that still is you know all of that i guess is secondary to
sw2867B-ms98-a-0074 537.045250 545.737000 [noise] to that criminal mischief element they're always going to create and find something to do
