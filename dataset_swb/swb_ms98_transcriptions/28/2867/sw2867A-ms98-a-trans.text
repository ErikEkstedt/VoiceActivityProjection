sw2867A-ms98-a-0004 13.848500 27.882250 yeah i guess i would pick a five i'm not quite sure i i share an interest o[f]- of of guns and i have some guns and i have two brothers-in-law who when we get together we go plinking and and one of them hunts and so it's talked about it
sw2867A-ms98-a-0005 27.882250 34.997750 i don't quite understand the NRA's uh CIA type stand it seems to me they'd be
sw2867A-ms98-a-0006 34.997750 49.107750 guns can become an a hobby and it they they take the approach of uh too too hard nosed on it and i don't quite understand i don't i i i mean i my brother-in-law hunts and and he doesn't need a automatic or semiautomatic gun to hunt
sw2867A-ms98-a-0007 49.107750 64.009750 and i don't quite understand the the Uzis and all that i think those should be banned i think that uh y[ou]- oh yeah hunters uh should get whatever they think they need but heck we've had hunting r[ifles]- rifles for a hundred years and so uh
sw2867A-ms98-a-0008 64.009750 67.323750 they're certainly not Uzis and things like that you know

sw2867A-ms98-a-0038 213.662000 220.953375 [silence]
sw2867A-ms98-a-0039 220.953375 223.566750 i uh i do[n't]- i don't
sw2867A-ms98-a-0040 223.566750 230.450250 i don't know why the N[RA]- i always said i'm uh probably a five although i haven't really that's not a very well thought out uh since they gave a number system
sw2867A-ms98-a-0041 230.450250 243.859375 uh my brother-in-law one of them hunts and the other one is a real collector and we get together we go shooting and i've been a lot of plinking and uh as a kid you know as a teenager we'd go to the rifle range and everything and shoot twenty twos and everything
sw2867A-ms98-a-0042 243.859375 249.710875 problems we have in society is like today some teenager locally here in the Metroplex
sw2867A-ms98-a-0043 249.710875 259.127750 used a a twenty two whatever and uh y[ou]- it's on the news if you listen to the news tonight and went after his teacher and fired three or four shots uh at the school now
sw2867A-ms98-a-0044 259.127750 272.651250 to me gun control is not going to control it but the parents you know a teenager you know below eighteen or whatever the age should be right uh guns should be an adult should be responsible now i think that if you have a gun an adult
sw2867A-ms98-a-0045 272.651250 279.310625 then you have a responsibility for whether you call it locking it up or putting it somewhere where absolutely no teenager can get to it
sw2867A-ms98-a-0046 279.310625 280.853625 [silence]
sw2867A-ms98-a-0047 280.853625 284.093625 that's oh well that includes little kids too yeah
sw2867A-ms98-a-0048 284.093625 287.453000 [silence]
sw2867A-ms98-a-0049 287.453000 288.858000 yeah
sw2867A-ms98-a-0050 288.858000 307.477375 [silence]
sw2867A-ms98-a-0051 307.477375 308.828250 right
sw2867A-ms98-a-0052 308.828250 319.872500 i'm not sure it should be part of a crime bill i think i i i think guns need controls intelligent controls but i don't think it has maybe a one percent relationship directly to crime
sw2867A-ms98-a-0053 319.872500 333.275375 uh buying Uzis and all that may you know i think that the cops should have the [laughter-best] weapons and whatever they need but i don't think the average uh plinker or hunter needs to go out and buy be able to buy that i don't think he should uh
sw2867A-ms98-a-0054 333.275375 336.195000 be allowed to buy an Uzi or something
sw2867A-ms98-a-0055 336.195000 341.414375 [silence]
sw2867A-ms98-a-0056 341.414375 343.515125 oh yeah
sw2867A-ms98-a-0057 343.515125 356.006625 [silence]
sw2867A-ms98-a-0058 356.006625 369.454500 i know it's it's shooting against people you know they go out i i've seen them_1 on TV and they actually have these little clubs where they go out and practice shooting each other you know i mean uh yeah and i i think uh it should be in the hunting realm
sw2867A-ms98-a-0059 369.454500 381.573375 i don't know why the NRA doesn't have nice range you talk about a range you're right ranges are hard to we have them_1 here in Arlington i have one here in Fort Worth i go to but uh i would think the R NRA would take the positive side and open up some nice
sw2867A-ms98-a-0060 381.573375 394.488250 practice ranges and teach it you know and rather than just uh try to [vocalized-noise] lobby for it you know they they ought to be come out in the open uh and open up some maybe they do have a lot of good ranges but the ones i go to are just ranges you know i don't
sw2867A-ms98-a-0061 394.488250 409.091875 [silence]
sw2867A-ms98-a-0062 409.091875 410.360000 yeah
sw2867A-ms98-a-0063 410.360000 411.579375 [silence]
sw2867A-ms98-a-0064 411.579375 413.038625 well my m[y]- 
sw2867A-ms98-a-0065 413.038625 424.526750 my brother-in-law's in San Antonio and he uh they're they're closing the the ranges they're slowly but surely closing so when i go here in Fort Worth it's in south part of Fort Worth it is run very well of course it has guns uh to buy
sw2867A-ms98-a-0066 424.526750 434.344000 but they have a state trooper i guess he's in his spare time he's always there with a forty five automatic on his side so that that's the only range i've been to that has a cop there
sw2867A-ms98-a-0067 434.344000 443.810375 [silence]
sw2867A-ms98-a-0068 443.810375 453.775500 right no i think that's the i've seen him there are some real amateurs that yeah there's some real amateurs that come i saw one one time when somebody came with with a
sw2867A-ms98-a-0069 453.775500 460.259625 non-hunting one of these and he was just s[winging]- you know s[winging]- moving it around waving it ar[ound]- well pardon me
sw2867A-ms98-a-0070 460.259625 461.422625 [silence]
sw2867A-ms98-a-0071 461.422625 468.308125 no he's just there to uh tell everybody hey this is where you aim and watch it you're pu[tting]- you're endangering the rest of the people
sw2867A-ms98-a-0072 468.308125 479.552250 and of course when you go and take your targets down he's there to make sure that people uh that's what it was people did not t[otally]- totally unload their guns when you you when you take your targets down you walk in front of your own guns
sw2867A-ms98-a-0073 479.552250 490.970000 and he would just look over everyone's shoulder and say hey your your gun's not unloaded you know you have to unload because_1 you walk out there uh in this particular range uh uh in Fort Worth now the other ranges it's always somebody else but
sw2867A-ms98-a-0074 490.970000 505.162750 the the inspector would come by and say or the rifle range uh owner would come by and look at everyone's gun before he would step in front of you and so you need some sort of common sense as well as expertise with a gun before you put a bunch of dummies out there in front with guns now
sw2867A-ms98-a-0075 505.162750 512.860625 [silence]
sw2867A-ms98-a-0076 512.860625 514.904375 oh yeah that's great yeah
sw2867A-ms98-a-0077 514.904375 518.657125 [silence]
sw2867A-ms98-a-0078 518.657125 528.727250 that's a good question yeah the i own i have girls so they haven't been in scou[ts]- doe[s]- does scouting have a gun section where they they teach them_1 twenty twos and all that oh that's great that's great i think that's the way it should be
sw2867A-ms98-a-0079 528.727250 532.648000 [silence]
sw2867A-ms98-a-0080 532.648000 534.098125 they just plink
sw2867A-ms98-a-0081 534.098125 540.432250 [silence]
sw2867A-ms98-a-0082 540.432250 542.230750 yeah
sw2867A-ms98-a-0083 542.230750 544.057500 [silence]
sw2867A-ms98-a-0084 544.057500 549.314250 yeah i again that's why i don't think it should be part of a criminal or a crime bill because they
sw2867A-ms98-a-0085 549.314250 564.232000 [silence]
sw2867A-ms98-a-0086 564.232000 576.927500 yeah but we have to look ahead because we we've had the two hundred years worth of uh or m[ore]- longer rather we came over with guns four hundred years i guess you might say and i think we have to look at it as it's not going to solve it next week we just got to look uh
sw2867A-ms98-a-0087 576.927500 587.531125 for the next ten or twenty years you know what kind of gun uh not controls gun uh legislature should we have and then it'll slowly change it's going to take twenty five years or so
sw2867A-ms98-a-0088 587.531125 599.849500 maybe to get the the the the guns into a controlled atmosphere where the true hunter you know it has a registered gun and people that allow other children to to get access to a gun should be fined you kn[ow]-
