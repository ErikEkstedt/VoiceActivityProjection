sw2870B-ms98-a-0017 68.761000 81.319250 well it used to be it's kind of hard to say now especially after Desert Storm but um i think back in the eigh[ties]- times when uh my political opinions were being formed like in Viet[nam]- during the Vietnam war and stuff
sw2870B-ms98-a-0018 81.319250 83.683500 the Republicans were more
sw2870B-ms98-a-0019 83.683500 92.576750 you know what they called Hawks which is more like aggressive in war and more pro-war and pro-aggression and um

sw2870B-ms98-a-0024 114.031750 127.823875 th[e]- the big Republican thing is that they don't they vote for less government they want less government involvement in society and so they're more less apt to vote in you know more aid to people or more
sw2870B-ms98-a-0025 127.823875 132.455500 m[ore]- uh they're less apt to vote in programs that involve the government

sw2870B-ms98-a-0067 240.536375 245.247375 yeah it's really hard too because before they used to have um
sw2870B-ms98-a-0068 245.247375 247.154125 a lot of [noise]
sw2870B-ms98-a-0069 247.154125 260.944000 it seems like the stuff that they put out now it i mean i doesn't just seem like it i know for a fact that the any kind of stuff that if you wrote and asked for material well what do you believe in what do you believe in they don't take any stands on anything they kind of say well what do you want me to believe [laughter]
sw2870B-ms98-a-0070 260.944000 265.574125 or they word it so that it's really hard to tell where they're standing on certain issues

sw2870B-ms98-a-0074 269.862625 275.065375 um-hum yeah they have to kind of take a stand on some things like abortion and
sw2870B-ms98-a-0075 275.065375 285.216125 things like that so that's kind of how i judge there's a few things where they have to say yes or no like abortion or gun control or let me see i try to look at
sw2870B-ms98-a-0076 285.216125 295.302875 what [noise] if some of the newspaper articles or the i don't trust TV as much but newspaper articles can show wheth[er]- how they voted in the past
sw2870B-ms98-a-0077 295.302875 301.516000 and but you get you know it all depends again on whose writing it and who they're for because they can slant that too

sw2870B-ms98-a-0141 481.461625 491.171250 i think that's that's having a big effect on how poorly that the country's being run is that um the the election
sw2870B-ms98-a-0142 491.171250 503.728375 the people that want to get elected are turning it into a popularity contest by advertising the things that [noise] you know that really don't have anything to do with how well they do the job but see they're trying to find an excuse not to deal with what
sw2870B-ms98-a-0143 503.728375 511.803500 you know the issues that people really want to know about because on those issues you have to say yes or no and if they don't say yes or no then
sw2870B-ms98-a-0144 511.803500 520.577625 maybe somebody'll vote for them_1 that wouldn't have if they had come down on the wrong side do you know what i'm saying so they just try and make it a personal thing i mean if you remember
sw2870B-ms98-a-0145 520.577625 529.405125 any of the TV commercials from the last presidential campaign they all had uh pictures of Bush with his grandchildren walking around with his grandchildren and
sw2870B-ms98-a-0146 529.405125 535.106375 even from Reagan it was all just like looks like a McDonald's commercial you know [laughter]
sw2870B-ms98-a-0147 535.106375 537.634500 [laughter] that's [laughter-about] what it looked like

sw2870B-ms98-a-0149 538.636625 547.493750 i just thought he was really inept i don't think he did anything at all he they just kind of sat him up there like a puppet and the people that were

sw2870B-ms98-a-0151 553.860375 563.949250 well i think that was part of it i think there's a lot of the the economic problems that the country was having at the time and the the recession and stuff people just had a picture of Carter as not being real capable
sw2870B-ms98-a-0152 563.949250 566.559375 but he actually all right [laughter-this]
sw2870B-ms98-a-0153 566.559375 568.987375 i thought he was great [laughter]
sw2870B-ms98-a-0154 568.987375 580.954250 did you i always liked him i thought he was great at the time and i i just couldn't get over the fact that Reagan beat him i you know that i just couldn't believe that he got voted out
