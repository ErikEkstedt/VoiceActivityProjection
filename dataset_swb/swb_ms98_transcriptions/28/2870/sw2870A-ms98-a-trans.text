sw2870A-ms98-a-0112 417.627625 423.315625 a lot of women would have voted for him just because he was nicer looking not that i think he was good looking but

sw2870A-ms98-a-0116 430.343125 433.273750 but because it was he had an affair

sw2870A-ms98-a-0118 435.915875 438.581250 and a lot of people go by their uh
