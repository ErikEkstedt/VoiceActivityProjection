sw2879A-ms98-a-0031 141.731125 149.552000 they had been uh looking at a bill uh making it easier to accept the bill to access to access handguns and they passed it
sw2879A-ms98-a-0032 149.552000 155.195625 which basically means without an FBI check any person in this state over twenty one can get a gun

sw2879A-ms98-a-0045 198.138625 208.586125 right they're not the cattiness behind right yeah i mean i don't like guns in general but when i think about uh this topic like capital punishment i look at somebody
sw2879A-ms98-a-0046 208.586125 218.178750 i mean i just remember when i was in college in a dorm and i think if he'd been around one of my family members probably would have killed him but in Florida in the state of Washington when they had the Ted Bundy case
sw2879A-ms98-a-0047 218.178750 224.343000 and how they just exe[cuted]- well it hasn't been just but it was in the i think the second or third quarter of last year nineteen ninety
sw2879A-ms98-a-0048 224.343000 235.950000 and i had you know i knew some people that said why are you glad you di[d]- you know this had nothing and i said just maybe because he got a lot of media hype and all that but i actually i mean there should be more cases like that where they 
sw2879A-ms98-a-0049 235.950000 241.776250 flip a sw[itch]- i have and i might be too cold too but they flip a switch i don't know i mean
sw2879A-ms98-a-0050 241.776250 244.863000 [silence]
sw2879A-ms98-a-0051 244.863000 246.082750 so many [laughter-times] 
sw2879A-ms98-a-0052 246.082750 247.423875 yeah
sw2879A-ms98-a-0053 247.423875 248.921250 [silence]
sw2879A-ms98-a-0054 248.921250 262.015000 yeah i mean and that's just maybe because of the little more that they said celebrated that uh he's not the only one you know you you see somebody's mini series and you hear about somebody's crime there was something on and this gets back to capital punishment
sw2879A-ms98-a-0055 262.015000 272.828750 but the man had stolen uh not stolen but kidnapped uh some wealthy ex-athlete's daughter somewhere in Florida and they changed all the facts that they said it was true and they buried her alive
sw2879A-ms98-a-0056 272.828750 282.919250 and Peter Strauss had played the lead role and the man and and the at the end of you know how they have these mini dramas at the end they said this set person was paroled like six months ago and you're thinking [laughter-oh] 
sw2879A-ms98-a-0057 282.919250 284.091875 that's nice
sw2879A-ms98-a-0058 284.091875 289.753000 [noise] i mean you know i'm not sure that capital punishment serves as a deterrence
sw2879A-ms98-a-0059 289.753000 294.719625 but it does serve as a pun[ishment]- uh definite pun[ishment]- you know lasting punish[ment]-
sw2879A-ms98-a-0060 294.719625 296.663375 [silence]
sw2879A-ms98-a-0061 296.663375 299.528000 right in that particular instance um
sw2879A-ms98-a-0062 299.528000 310.251625 but i but i don't but i know it's not a end all and be all that's the problem i have with it in Texas they think it's an end all and be all they think that if they electrocute or slip or do something e[lse]- gas somebody 
sw2879A-ms98-a-0063 310.251625 320.974250 um that they're not going to have the crimes that they do have and we happen to live in Dallas which is extremely crime ridden and we just moved here uh we've been here before lived in Minneapolis Saint Paul
sw2879A-ms98-a-0064 320.974250 332.751750 uh which has an exceedingly low crime rate and then we were transferred back here and when you're gone from some place like it for about six years as we were you really begin to see uh just how problematic
sw2879A-ms98-a-0065 332.751750 342.226125 just living is even suburban no matter where you are and how you're in Rome New York is that and and is that like near Albany or Syracuse
sw2879A-ms98-a-0066 342.226125 348.120875 [silence]
sw2879A-ms98-a-0067 348.120875 351.751875 what what type of area is that is that uh in term

sw2879A-ms98-a-0080 387.973500 390.699500 not the harsh criminality
sw2879A-ms98-a-0081 390.699500 393.669875 that you find in yeah now Dallas is a
sw2879A-ms98-a-0082 393.669875 398.359875 [laughter] i'm being very sarcastic it's just a great place um on some days uh [laughter] 
sw2879A-ms98-a-0083 398.359875 400.284125 it's um
sw2879A-ms98-a-0084 400.284125 407.658375 i don't know the good ole boy network here is uh very strange like i said they believe that if they kill somebody you know
sw2879A-ms98-a-0085 407.658375 417.850500 tit for tat and deed for deed that that does something uh but yet they want spend the money to build the new jails that i mean they really are over crowded i mean that's that's just not a cop out
sw2879A-ms98-a-0086 417.850500 427.046625 um and i just you know i'm originally from Pennsylvania which i think is basically like New York these days i'm not sure if they i don't think they have capital punishment there

sw2879A-ms98-a-0092 438.214375 444.791250 um because they use to be very very conservative when i was growing up i and i can't i haven't lived there in twenty years but um

sw2879A-ms98-a-0096 455.797625 467.520250 i don't know i think everybody would feel it is same way if they were touched by crime i think everyone would you and i think are probably honest and candid because we could do it on in this vehicle um but i think everybody if they were touched by it would say 
sw2879A-ms98-a-0097 467.520250 476.806500 if they had any sense of rage that could be brought out which i think every human does i think they'd say yeah do it if somebody in my family or if it happened it me you know um

sw2879A-ms98-a-0102 492.308375 504.592250 oh i did a paper back in college a long time ago for criminal justice class and i just the subject i remember we drew things out of a hat and it was something uh just it was basically the essence was does the crime fit the punishment and 
sw2879A-ms98-a-0103 504.592250 515.451875 when you see how many repeat offenders there are uh check check fraud cases where they go to jail for five to ten years and um rape rapist getting their hand just slapped
sw2879A-ms98-a-0104 515.451875 524.220750 you know and how it is based on the judge and if the time of day that the court is in session you know all these uh i[ntangible]- i[ntangible]- intangible things and you're thinking
sw2879A-ms98-a-0105 524.220750 528.576750 [laughter] you would not only would you not want to be a victim you wouldn't want to be a criminal [laughter-either]
