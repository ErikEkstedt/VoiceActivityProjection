sw2892B-ms98-a-0062 200.986125 203.761000 i'm like you i think the judges need to
sw2892B-ms98-a-0063 203.761000 210.336125 or i don't know build more prisons i don't care you know or and execute some of these guys that are on death row you know

sw2892B-ms98-a-0068 218.379625 230.577375 and if they would you know when they send these guys to the death penalty kill them_1 you know quit wasting our taxpayers' money by having appeals appeals appeals appeals just get them_1 on and kill them_1 and go on with it you know and
sw2892B-ms98-a-0069 230.577375 239.084250 empty there's there's a bunch on death row we'd empty a lot bunch of beds if we'd uh uh you know do what we're supposed to do and get on with it but and to me that that's a
sw2892B-ms98-a-0070 239.084250 241.038625 that's right
sw2892B-ms98-a-0071 241.038625 243.228500 and if you know
sw2892B-ms98-a-0072 243.228500 251.244000 if uh uh i know Texas is one of the leading ones that we we've probably executed probably more than i think Texas Florida
sw2892B-ms98-a-0073 251.244000 253.475750 and Alaba[ma]- yeah
sw2892B-ms98-a-0074 253.475750 257.887375 [laughter] yeah the southern states are are more into that and [laughter]

sw2892B-ms98-a-0079 266.760000 277.392750 yeah and then they get out for good behavior you know and that makes but see i don't care what they say i think the death penalty is a deterrent to some t[o]- t[o]- to some extent and you know
sw2892B-ms98-a-0080 277.392750 288.427500 about_1 did did you watch sixty minutes the other night about the criminals those prisoners being given a free education from Boston University and i thought and i thought [vocalized-noise] golly and this [vocalized-noise] uh
sw2892B-ms98-a-0081 288.427500 300.844375 one guy said you know if they want to give out a free education there is a lot of poor people that'll like to have a uh degree from B U you know why give it to these criminals who aren't going to be able to use it anyway you know and i just
sw2892B-ms98-a-0082 300.844375 309.377875 makes me sick that they could they're mollycoddle i remember down here one time the judge ordered the uh
sw2892B-ms98-a-0083 309.377875 320.039375 i think the [vocalized-noise] prisoners complained that didn't have color TV so they had to give them colored TV as a cruel and unusual punishment because_1 they didn't have colored TV they had to watch black and white [laughter] oh God

sw2892B-ms98-a-0097 361.459125 362.820375 um-hum
sw2892B-ms98-a-0098 362.820375 364.800250 yeah right right
sw2892B-ms98-a-0099 364.800250 375.636250 or they're forced into you know having so many minorities and whether they're qualified or not they hire them_1 because they have to have that ratio Blacks and Whites and Hispanics so they uh
sw2892B-ms98-a-0100 375.636250 390.372625 that's uh what's happening to a lot of them i think they're getting and these guys probably aren't good cops anyway but they were in the right place at the right time and the right minority so they they're getting on i'm i'm sure i know there's some good minority policeman but
sw2892B-ms98-a-0101 390.372625 394.789000 uh they're not applying [laughter-for] [laughter-the] [laughter-job] i mean it's the minorities but they're not applying for the jobs especially
sw2892B-ms98-a-0102 394.789000 400.318875 and i think quotas li[ke]- and they do have quotas i guarantee you they've got quotas they have to have so many
sw2892B-ms98-a-0103 400.318875 401.487625 and uh
sw2892B-ms98-a-0104 401.487625 405.431875 like i say whether and that's the same with the fire department anything else and
sw2892B-ms98-a-0105 405.431875 417.860000 if they're not qualified they shouldn't have it you know i don't i don't think they should lower the standards just so they can pass the test or anything and that's what they do a lot they just lower the standards a little bit and that way more people qualify and i think that's
sw2892B-ms98-a-0106 417.860000 421.191500 [silence]
