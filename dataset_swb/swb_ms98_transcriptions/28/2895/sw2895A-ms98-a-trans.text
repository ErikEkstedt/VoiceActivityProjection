sw2895A-ms98-a-0028 113.030250 117.009875 had something different for him every holiday
sw2895A-ms98-a-0029 117.009875 125.520375 uh for Christmas or Thanksgiving whichever one they're with us and uh i think the two [noise] that have been the biggest hits
sw2895A-ms98-a-0030 125.520375 130.908625 uh i think one of them came out of the Martha Stewart cookbook
sw2895A-ms98-a-0031 130.908625 144.601375 you're familiar with Martha Stewart her all of her culinary delights and it was it wasn't all that you know yummy and i[t]- it wasn't a lot to eat but it was interesting carameli[zed]- caramelized onions
sw2895A-ms98-a-0032 144.601375 158.377750 and uh you cut them in half and turn them over with the cu[t]- you know don't peel them_1 or anything and turn them_1 over with the cut side down and you bake them like two hours and a half on about two seventy five or something like that
sw2895A-ms98-a-0033 158.377750 164.068750 and then when you know until they're kind of well not really burned they call them_1 caramelized and then
sw2895A-ms98-a-0034 164.068750 172.763625 you uh you mix up this little uh mixture of cranberries and sugar and a few nuts and
sw2895A-ms98-a-0035 172.763625 182.068625 uh a little bit of liquid and then you bake that for about thirty minutes and then you it's just a really pretty condiment r[eally]- actually
sw2895A-ms98-a-0036 182.068625 195.873125 and so then you just eat the insides you know the few layers of onions that didn't get hard or anything and then uh then that filling but that was interesting and another interesting one that he liked so well was
sw2895A-ms98-a-0037 195.873125 202.496625 turnips i've always had a neighbor or two that ha[d]- wanted to bring me turnips well who not many people like turnips
sw2895A-ms98-a-0038 202.496625 204.198375 but i did
sw2895A-ms98-a-0039 204.198375 207.575875 a casserole using half turnips half potatoes

sw2895A-ms98-a-0041 210.530000 214.816625 and just baked them and it is absolutely wonderful
sw2895A-ms98-a-0042 214.816625 218.194375 if and the secret is using half potatoes
