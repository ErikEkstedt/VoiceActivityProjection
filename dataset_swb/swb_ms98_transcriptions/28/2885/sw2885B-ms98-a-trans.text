sw2885B-ms98-a-0002 1.158875 3.696625 [silence]
sw2885B-ms98-a-0003 3.696625 8.954000 well the the the changes of course in the p[ast]- past generation are the women in the work force
sw2885B-ms98-a-0004 8.954000 23.540000 um and the while their p[ositions]- salaries still aren't there yet the opportunities for women who are at least driven uh do do tend to be a little bit more compatible with uh changes in life style
sw2885B-ms98-a-0005 23.540000 30.855875 so i suspect that that may have had more to do with uh changes in society than anything else is the number of the women in the work force
sw2885B-ms98-a-0006 30.855875 43.588000 [silence]
sw2885B-ms98-a-0007 43.588000 45.680000 um-hum
sw2885B-ms98-a-0008 45.680000 50.080375 [silence]
sw2885B-ms98-a-0009 50.080375 55.471500 um i think it depends on which positions and perhaps the personalities of the women
sw2885B-ms98-a-0010 55.471500 60.263000 um let's face it there there are men executives who have um
sw2885B-ms98-a-0011 60.263000 74.126500 uh go[tten]- gotten there by uh rather um unsavory means uh you know [vocalized-noise] trapping everybody up along the way um when uh uh they may not be necessarily liked but if when a woman does that she is ridiculed
sw2885B-ms98-a-0012 74.126500 79.543125 uh to the n-th degree where as it's almost expected of men so some of that is stereotype i think
sw2885B-ms98-a-0013 79.543125 81.474500 [silence]
sw2885B-ms98-a-0014 81.474500 87.035875 um-hum i think i have although at the mo[ment]- y[ou]- i mean i know a little bit about it but
sw2885B-ms98-a-0015 87.035875 92.448250 [silence]
sw2885B-ms98-a-0016 92.448250 93.948875 yeah
sw2885B-ms98-a-0017 93.948875 99.025000 [silence]
sw2885B-ms98-a-0018 99.025000 100.771500 right
sw2885B-ms98-a-0019 100.771500 103.616125 [silence]
sw2885B-ms98-a-0020 103.616125 116.262500 um-hum um-hum um-hum i think the educational opportunities have made some difference uh because at one point i know my mother-in-law use[d]- uh talked about when she went to college
sw2885B-ms98-a-0021 116.262500 130.940125 she really sort of had to to do her own way because although she was one of three daughters um and while her parents were um very supportive in many ways they didn't really seem to have the um th[e]- the uh
sw2885B-ms98-a-0022 130.940125 143.915625 i don't know the understanding that that daughters should go on for a college degree uh had they been sons uh you know that would have been expected but for daughters it wasn't as necessary um and see i don't think that's so true anymore i think
sw2885B-ms98-a-0023 143.915625 151.783875 people expect both daughters and sons to have whatever opportunities are available uh i know we have three sons and one daughter but the differences
sw2885B-ms98-a-0024 151.783875 166.324875 are are negligent in that area and in fact they they were in my own families as well um it was never considered that my sister and i wouldn't go to college uh y[ou]- and you know certainly my brothers would but but we were included in that so i think those things do
sw2885B-ms98-a-0025 166.324875 171.245750 [silence]
sw2885B-ms98-a-0026 171.245750 172.620500 um-hum

sw2885B-ms98-a-0028 189.258750 190.602500 uh-huh
sw2885B-ms98-a-0029 190.602500 192.629625 oh yeah
sw2885B-ms98-a-0030 192.629625 196.271875 [silence]
sw2885B-ms98-a-0031 196.271875 198.329500 right right
sw2885B-ms98-a-0032 198.329500 204.720250 [silence]
sw2885B-ms98-a-0033 204.720250 209.015250 right right well you know that hasn't changed so much
sw2885B-ms98-a-0034 209.015250 222.891375 i know uh i[t's]- it it's always appalled me because i did not uh suffer that same problem fortunately uh because i went into biological research when i first got out of college um and so you know i was not in a in a situation where i would
sw2885B-ms98-a-0035 222.891375 230.835625 [laughter] asked to do typing uh [laughter] but um i know that even now um many young women getting out of college
sw2885B-ms98-a-0036 230.835625 238.874250 tend to find themselves in that position of of having to be uh sort of part of the secretarial pool it might not be called that but that boils down to what it is
sw2885B-ms98-a-0037 238.874250 245.451375 until they work their way up and i don't think very many young men are ask to do that although perhaps they are asked to do
sw2885B-ms98-a-0038 245.451375 256.649250 somewhat uh less uh technical jobs or y[ou]- you know too perhaps uh you know start working their way up but i don't think it's quite as um as low on the totem pole
sw2885B-ms98-a-0039 256.649250 260.995625 [silence]
sw2885B-ms98-a-0040 260.995625 262.244875 um-hum

sw2885B-ms98-a-0046 288.050750 294.675750 yeah i do know that uh there are plenty of uh executive secretaries
sw2885B-ms98-a-0047 294.675750 303.928875 whose responsibilities are greater than the CEO's uh [laughter] that and they may not make the money but they they have a lot of prestige many do make the money too actually but
sw2885B-ms98-a-0048 303.928875 305.027375 [silence]
sw2885B-ms98-a-0049 305.027375 311.909250 um-hum and sometimes those are men too sometimes those secretaries are men which is good i'm glad to see that change um
sw2885B-ms98-a-0050 311.909250 321.453750 [silence]
sw2885B-ms98-a-0051 321.453750 328.967125 oh yeah and they go to the hospital and uh uh uh one parent w[hat]- w[hat]- i guess the the uh father was killed
sw2885B-ms98-a-0052 328.967125 338.301375 and they get to the hospital and the doctor comes in to uh work on the injured child and says oh i can't uh do that that's my child
sw2885B-ms98-a-0053 338.301375 351.383375 yeah i mean [vocalized-noise] but see it's so obvious i guess the first time i heard it i immediately thought of a doctor because that's what i originally wanted to do [laughter] so it['s]- but it's amazing how many people do you know for a minute stop and think 
sw2885B-ms98-a-0054 351.383375 358.758375 yeah i'm i'm yeah sure we're all victims of this sure we've we've been brought up in the society that's perpetrated that problem
sw2885B-ms98-a-0055 358.758375 364.148125 [silence]
sw2885B-ms98-a-0056 364.148125 365.366125 yeah
sw2885B-ms98-a-0057 365.366125 367.173875 [silence]
sw2885B-ms98-a-0058 367.173875 368.791250 yeah
sw2885B-ms98-a-0059 368.791250 372.511125 [silence]
sw2885B-ms98-a-0060 372.511125 378.477000 well i don't have yeah r[ight]- right i i suppose my feeling is that it doesn't matter male or female uh
sw2885B-ms98-a-0061 378.477000 392.001250 at least they if they're given the same opportunity then that's good although they can't always th[ere]- there are certainly differences of men and women the i guess the other thing that was asked in this to for us to discuss was um what kind of changes this has brought about or what do we see in the future
sw2885B-ms98-a-0062 392.001250 404.242625 and uh just because this Sund[ay]- past Sunday was Mother's Day of course there was some articles in the newspaper about the uh mothers in the work force and that h[as]- that has certainly made a tremendous difference in society
sw2885B-ms98-a-0063 404.242625 413.459500 but what is interesting is at least in the Washington Post there was um a a a report of a study that suggested that there were more women now
sw2885B-ms98-a-0064 413.459500 427.525750 who regretted the necessity for having to work and and leave their young children and that more if given the opportunity i[f]- if financial if it were not financially necessary would stay home you know would have the choi[ce]- would m[ake]- take make the choice of staying home
sw2885B-ms98-a-0065 427.525750 441.485375 while their children were young um and it's interesting because i don't know if that's a switch if somehow maybe that's being revalued or reevaluated or not i was fortunate enough that um well it was a decision
sw2885B-ms98-a-0066 441.485375 456.381375 uh when we had children to make that decision and we determined that we would live on my s[alary]- on my husband's salary when we first got married so that when we had children we would not y[ou]- you know fall into that necessity of ha[ving]- my having to work and so we made that choice we didn't live as well but we lived well enough
sw2885B-ms98-a-0067 456.381375 465.551750 uh uh sure but you see for me that was the more more important i know of plenty of f[riends]- of friends who did not were not able to make that choice
sw2885B-ms98-a-0068 465.551750 478.688625 and that's difficult because i think in the long run uh part of the problem in society and maybe part of what happens to the bad the negative attitude of women working comes about because children
sw2885B-ms98-a-0069 478.688625 487.931000 remember the the traumas of their mothers trying to work and run the household and some of those things that that has not changed and i think that's a serious issue
sw2885B-ms98-a-0070 487.931000 489.154250 [silence]
sw2885B-ms98-a-0071 489.154250 490.992500 exactly yeah
sw2885B-ms98-a-0072 490.992500 491.920500 [silence]
sw2885B-ms98-a-0073 491.920500 493.179875 right
sw2885B-ms98-a-0074 493.179875 494.753875 [silence]
sw2885B-ms98-a-0075 494.753875 509.115125 oh yeah it it's very difficult so that needs to be done and ed[ucation]- perhaps education will eventually do it but uh the idea that that all those uh things that were traditionally thought to be the housewife when she was home as a housewife are still hers even if she's out working
sw2885B-ms98-a-0076 509.115125 512.274125 uh you know that's a serious problem uh
sw2885B-ms98-a-0077 512.274125 524.135750 [silence]
sw2885B-ms98-a-0078 524.135750 528.009375 wow that's nice yeah
sw2885B-ms98-a-0079 528.009375 529.050875 [silence]
sw2885B-ms98-a-0080 529.050875 534.326000 um-hum and can take care of the child if if if the child is ill or something yeah yeah
sw2885B-ms98-a-0081 534.326000 537.611000 [silence]
sw2885B-ms98-a-0082 537.611000 539.347375 um-hum

sw2885B-ms98-a-0084 542.830500 544.514250 um-hum
sw2885B-ms98-a-0085 544.514250 553.535625 right and actually i have a few friends who who uh have a a no[ntraditional]- a nontraditional uh family in that the husband is is home with the children
sw2885B-ms98-a-0086 553.535625 565.519625 uh and the wife is is out with the more uh uh nine to five kind of job and then the husband in one case is a is a musician so he does uh was uh
sw2885B-ms98-a-0087 565.519625 579.351750 guitar lessons and does a lot of uh professional playing you know for weekends and so on but essentially it's his wife who uh is the primary uh uh money provider there it's an interesting situation and they have three children
sw2885B-ms98-a-0088 579.351750 587.505875 uh so and it seems to have worked very well but um but those things are rare i i must say they're still not uh
sw2885B-ms98-a-0089 587.505875 590.477875 [silence]
sw2885B-ms98-a-0090 590.477875 592.690000 no no

sw2885B-ms98-a-0092 596.682000 598.793000 it is the exception yeah
