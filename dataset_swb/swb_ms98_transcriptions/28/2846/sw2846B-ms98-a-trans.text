sw2846B-ms98-a-0002 2.076875 12.487000 well i have uh uh basically have grown children i've got one that's that is a part-time college student and one that's college age but not attending so
sw2846B-ms98-a-0003 12.487000 13.968125 uh
sw2846B-ms98-a-0004 13.968125 16.024500 he did it
sw2846B-ms98-a-0005 16.024500 23.897625 yeah he he did uh attend a little bit you know they took some classes and then decided it college was not what he wanted to do so
sw2846B-ms98-a-0006 23.897625 30.348750 he went along the the older one the daughter who is older is going part-time and working full time
sw2846B-ms98-a-0007 30.348750 38.814500 uh she's attending a community college right now and she would like to go on to a you know to a four year school go ahead and get a degree
sw2846B-ms98-a-0008 38.814500 41.463125 and uh that's you know one of her
sw2846B-ms98-a-0009 41.463125 44.196000 immediate long range objectives
sw2846B-ms98-a-0010 44.196000 47.323250 [silence]
sw2846B-ms98-a-0011 47.323250 48.967000 yeah uh
sw2846B-ms98-a-0012 48.967000 52.769375 [silence]
sw2846B-ms98-a-0013 52.769375 54.085875 oh yeah so you
sw2846B-ms98-a-0014 54.085875 55.402250 uh
sw2846B-ms98-a-0015 55.402250 68.521750 [silence]
sw2846B-ms98-a-0016 68.521750 81.877250 right uh i i guess uh one thing [vocalized-noise] from from my own personal experience uh the drive is the important or is i i consider to be the important part of going to college 
sw2846B-ms98-a-0017 81.877250 90.831125 um i i was not an exceptional student by any means in high school i was not a bad student but was not an exceptional student
sw2846B-ms98-a-0018 90.831125 97.723000 and you know didn't really have uh any strong ambitions that required college
sw2846B-ms98-a-0019 97.723000 103.230875 but i did want to go to school did want to get the you know go ahead and get the college
sw2846B-ms98-a-0020 103.230875 110.591750 and so i worked my way through college and uh you know i think that it was because i really wanted the degree
sw2846B-ms98-a-0021 110.591750 117.484750 that i you know followed through and went ahead and and went on even finished up going to college after i got married
sw2846B-ms98-a-0022 117.484750 121.332250 and uh i like you said i think that uh
sw2846B-ms98-a-0023 121.332250 126.936625 the ambition and the drive is uh is pretty much k[ey]- a key there
sw2846B-ms98-a-0024 126.936625 132.118000 uh uh like i said we've got the one that's not going to college 
sw2846B-ms98-a-0025 132.118000 138.053375 he he just does not have the desire to go at this time are i hope that some day
sw2846B-ms98-a-0026 138.053375 147.104875 for my benefit i hope that some day he decides he wants to go because it will you know make me feel better but uh whatever makes him feel best is what's important i suppose
sw2846B-ms98-a-0027 147.104875 154.603500 [silence]
sw2846B-ms98-a-0028 154.603500 155.955625 uh-huh
sw2846B-ms98-a-0029 155.955625 165.694875 [silence]
sw2846B-ms98-a-0030 165.694875 168.433000 yeah and i i think that that's
sw2846B-ms98-a-0031 168.433000 192.260500 [silence]
sw2846B-ms98-a-0032 192.260500 195.152500 uh-huh i think that's a good idea uh
sw2846B-ms98-a-0033 195.152500 204.661500 and and too i guess uh looking at at what the the individuals interests are instead of just what uh
sw2846B-ms98-a-0034 204.661500 209.259875 what the popular degree plans are uh
sw2846B-ms98-a-0035 209.259875 215.468000 uh i started out in in high school expecting to go into engineering 
sw2846B-ms98-a-0036 215.468000 222.061250 and when i got into the mathematics and science classes i was not a bad student in tho[se]- in those areas but
sw2846B-ms98-a-0037 222.061250 233.360375 didn't really have the interest in it so i changed my my career design over into the accounting and business field and uh i am a CPA
sw2846B-ms98-a-0038 233.360375 243.216000 and i you know i'm pretty good at that but i it's not it was not something that i really thought long and hard and had a real [vocalized-noise] you know a real strong drive toward
sw2846B-ms98-a-0039 243.216000 254.149875 um i'm not sure what uh what i would have done differently or what i would do differently now but uh i might you know i might go in a different direction if i were to start fresh
sw2846B-ms98-a-0040 254.149875 255.803125 uh
sw2846B-ms98-a-0041 255.803125 266.620000 you know think more about what my real interest were instead of what my you know instead of what was available or what sounded like a good money maker uh it's not always the important thing
sw2846B-ms98-a-0042 266.620000 271.299250 [silence]
sw2846B-ms98-a-0043 271.299250 273.200375 right
sw2846B-ms98-a-0044 273.200375 276.569875 [silence]
sw2846B-ms98-a-0045 276.569875 277.995000 yeah

sw2846B-ms98-a-0052 319.896500 328.724000 [silence]
sw2846B-ms98-a-0053 328.724000 330.636125 noise
sw2846B-ms98-a-0054 330.636125 335.410125 yeah um an i guess another another area that uh
sw2846B-ms98-a-0055 335.410125 345.751500 in retrospect [vocalized-noise] i would give parents a real strong advice on is the the study habits and preparation that students need 
sw2846B-ms98-a-0056 345.751500 356.379625 and [vocalized-noise] a[nd]- and they need to start as early as they can you know not wait until they're a freshman in high school even to start developing good study habits and get the you know get the good basics 
sw2846B-ms98-a-0057 356.379625 362.047500 uh you know the math and the the English and a little science and stuff like that 
sw2846B-ms98-a-0058 362.047500 367.768875 that uh so they really have a good background for whatever course load they're going to take
sw2846B-ms98-a-0059 367.768875 375.296375 because uh i know in in my son's case his math background is is not very strong
sw2846B-ms98-a-0060 375.296375 383.372250 and we tried a lot you know to to help him but i think that the uh i think the educational system
sw2846B-ms98-a-0061 383.372250 389.130875 uh the way things are are run in this area anyway it it's a little weak and
sw2846B-ms98-a-0062 389.130875 395.619000 you know as a result he doesn't he doesn't have the math background that he would need in college
sw2846B-ms98-a-0063 395.619000 400.558500 and uh i think that's one reason that he's not interested he doesn't think he would do well
sw2846B-ms98-a-0064 400.558500 409.871875 [silence]
sw2846B-ms98-a-0065 409.871875 411.118250 uh-huh
sw2846B-ms98-a-0066 411.118250 417.317125 [silence]
sw2846B-ms98-a-0067 417.317125 418.532125 yeah
sw2846B-ms98-a-0068 418.532125 421.404375 uh i agree i think that makes a difference uh
sw2846B-ms98-a-0069 421.404375 427.917625 i went to a small town school also my son went to a school that had like twenty five hundred students in it or something you know
sw2846B-ms98-a-0070 427.917625 431.759375 and uh it's it's re[ally]- well it really makes a difference as to
sw2846B-ms98-a-0071 431.759375 434.220375 [silence]
sw2846B-ms98-a-0072 434.220375 435.518000 uh-huh [laughter]
sw2846B-ms98-a-0073 435.518000 454.044125 [silence]

sw2846B-ms98-a-0076 481.334750 482.452125 [laughter]
sw2846B-ms98-a-0077 482.452125 487.739000 yeah and that that does make a difference that's what like i was saying you know you get those basics behind you to start with
sw2846B-ms98-a-0078 487.739000 492.650875 uh you know get a good foundation in uh those core type courses 
sw2846B-ms98-a-0079 492.650875 501.508125 and it it will carry you a long way if you know the the concepts and the the logic and just understanding what the what's expected of you
sw2846B-ms98-a-0080 501.508125 504.972250 really makes a lot of difference in you know what you're capable of doing so
sw2846B-ms98-a-0081 504.972250 508.976750 well uh 
sw2846B-ms98-a-0082 508.976750 511.700125 yeah it's been nice i hope they got what they wanted on it
sw2846B-ms98-a-0083 511.700125 512.996250 [laughter]

sw2846B-ms98-a-0086 515.470000 517.303000 i'll talk to you later maybe thanks
