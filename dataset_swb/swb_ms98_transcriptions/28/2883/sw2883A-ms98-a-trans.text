sw2883A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.247500 [noise]
sw2883A-ms98-a-0002 1.247500 4.726875 well what are your did you like do you use credit cards
sw2883A-ms98-a-0003 4.726875 11.089250 [silence]
sw2883A-ms98-a-0004 11.089250 16.345000 huh-uh so it doesn't gets uh uh the credit uh
sw2883A-ms98-a-0005 16.345000 24.405500 uh interest rate is so high that you're really if you're going to use credit cards you need to use that policy i think don't you
sw2883A-ms98-a-0006 24.405500 30.564750 otherwise you end up paying so much more for your merchandise that it's hardly
sw2883A-ms98-a-0007 30.564750 33.347875 uh it's not a very good idea
sw2883A-ms98-a-0008 33.347875 34.593625 [silence]
sw2883A-ms98-a-0009 34.593625 37.701500 well i have a lot of them but i don't use them very much though 
sw2883A-ms98-a-0010 37.701500 38.597875 [laughter]
sw2883A-ms98-a-0011 38.597875 43.187750 i use them mostly for big things like maybe sometimes uh
sw2883A-ms98-a-0012 43.187750 45.061500 tuition if it's
sw2883A-ms98-a-0013 45.061500 52.047500 you know if i'm short to go ahead and get it and then try to get it saved back as quick as i can
sw2883A-ms98-a-0014 52.047500 57.336750 the other thing i i think if you do get overextended a little bit you need to be sure and pay it off
sw2883A-ms98-a-0015 57.336750 63.433750 uh more than one at a time because i think you could run forever paying what they require
sw2883A-ms98-a-0016 63.433750 65.531250 just goes on and on
sw2883A-ms98-a-0017 65.531250 66.767750 yeah
sw2883A-ms98-a-0018 66.767750 74.874750 [silence]
sw2883A-ms98-a-0019 74.874750 76.536750 yeah that's true
sw2883A-ms98-a-0020 76.536750 77.379125 [silence]
sw2883A-ms98-a-0021 77.379125 81.985000 there are times when it's when it's very useful like uh emergency trip
sw2883A-ms98-a-0022 81.985000 85.339750 or something sometimes when you when you
sw2883A-ms98-a-0023 85.339750 88.088250 the the money will be available but it's
sw2883A-ms98-a-0024 88.088250 98.027750 you know not immediately handy i think uh they're very helpful plus the fact that it's helpful not to have to carry a lot of money sometimes
sw2883A-ms98-a-0025 98.027750 103.273250 but uh i you really do need to be very um
sw2883A-ms98-a-0026 103.273250 104.369250 [silence]
sw2883A-ms98-a-0027 104.369250 108.811250 oh responsible about it or you end up in deep trouble
sw2883A-ms98-a-0028 108.811250 114.570375 [silence]
sw2883A-ms98-a-0029 114.570375 116.057875 uh-huh
sw2883A-ms98-a-0030 116.057875 128.687875 [silence]
sw2883A-ms98-a-0031 128.687875 129.899625 right
sw2883A-ms98-a-0032 129.899625 133.704500 right that can be very handy under those kind of circumstances
sw2883A-ms98-a-0033 133.704500 142.888625 the other thing about them is too if you really don't you really need to get some and use them because if you have never used them and developed and haven't developed a credit thing
sw2883A-ms98-a-0034 142.888625 154.097250 it stops you from doing a lot of things if you if you pay for everything by cash uh there is a lot of things that a lot of people who will not give you credit when you need something like a house or
sw2883A-ms98-a-0035 154.097250 163.773875 a car so so they they have become a very vital part of our of our monetary [laughter] system over the last few years
sw2883A-ms98-a-0036 163.773875 167.490125 but uh it's true you have to be very careful or you end up
sw2883A-ms98-a-0037 167.490125 174.238375 uh going in the deep end and uh and an awful lot of people are in trouble
sw2883A-ms98-a-0038 174.238375 179.484375 we have a boy living with us who works for a credit card uh
sw2883A-ms98-a-0039 179.484375 188.258000 company that and he makes calls to people who have problems you know credit problems that are trying to work out of them_1 and uh
sw2883A-ms98-a-0040 188.258000 189.011500 [laughter]
sw2883A-ms98-a-0041 189.011500 191.463500 poor thing he comes home very depressed every [laughter-night]
sw2883A-ms98-a-0042 191.463500 196.223125 [laughter] because the world has so many problems of that sort so it's uh it's uh
sw2883A-ms98-a-0043 196.223125 202.593750 it's a really big problem i think and um takes mature people to
sw2883A-ms98-a-0044 202.593750 208.971500 to treat it uh so that it's so that it's a real advantage to you instead of a disadvantage
sw2883A-ms98-a-0045 208.971500 215.849375 [silence]
sw2883A-ms98-a-0046 215.849375 217.104750 yeah
sw2883A-ms98-a-0047 217.104750 218.785625 [silence]
sw2883A-ms98-a-0048 218.785625 222.291125 right it doesn't do you any good now does it right
sw2883A-ms98-a-0049 222.291125 227.810875 even before it probably wasn't though because you didn't get anywhere near as much as what it
sw2883A-ms98-a-0050 227.810875 231.068625 you didn't get to claim anywhere near what you ended up paying
sw2883A-ms98-a-0051 231.068625 237.880625 so well i'm not that uh other than that i don't have too much on credit cards but
sw2883A-ms98-a-0052 237.880625 240.058125 it's good to talk to you
sw2883A-ms98-a-0053 240.058125 241.432875 uh-huh bye now
