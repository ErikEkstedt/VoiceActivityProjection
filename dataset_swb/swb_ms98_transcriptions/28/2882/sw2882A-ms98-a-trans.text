sw2882A-ms98-a-0014 32.961625 35.599000 i don't tend to
sw2882A-ms98-a-0015 35.599000 38.011375 unless there's a referendums
sw2882A-ms98-a-0016 38.011375 40.788000 something that's going to affect the town
sw2882A-ms98-a-0017 40.788000 43.027875 uh then i uh
sw2882A-ms98-a-0018 43.027875 43.392000 [noise]
sw2882A-ms98-a-0019 43.392000 45.136500 then i put my two cents in
sw2882A-ms98-a-0020 45.136500 48.897250 [silence]
sw2882A-ms98-a-0021 48.897250 51.135000 you never ever voted

sw2882A-ms98-a-0023 60.290125 64.028000 as far as uh [vocalized-noise]
sw2882A-ms98-a-0024 64.028000 81.709250 [silence]
sw2882A-ms98-a-0025 81.709250 91.315000 uh that's true unless you unless you come from i co[me]- i come from a fairly small town so i i live in Rhode Island but i work in Massachusetts um
sw2882A-ms98-a-0026 91.315000 98.426000 and it's fairly small and you and most of the people you tend to know at least the family or you know uh
sw2882A-ms98-a-0027 98.426000 99.713875 [silence]
sw2882A-ms98-a-0028 99.713875 101.512000 it's uh
sw2882A-ms98-a-0029 101.512000 106.546625 it's getting away from that now i mean the town's growing bigger as as all towns are
sw2882A-ms98-a-0030 106.546625 112.461125 and you're right they're uh uh i think uh
sw2882A-ms98-a-0031 112.461125 117.708500 most politicians when they first get into politics they want to do a good job
sw2882A-ms98-a-0032 117.708500 122.915750 and then after they're they're in there a while you have to play the good old boy network
sw2882A-ms98-a-0033 122.915750 125.150125 and it's uh
sw2882A-ms98-a-0034 125.150125 134.093000 uh um they have their own special interests and watch out for the people that are going to do the most for them too to get them reelected i think
sw2882A-ms98-a-0035 134.093000 141.271625 [silence]
sw2882A-ms98-a-0036 141.271625 147.222000 yeah how about uh bond issues or referendum that they they put on

sw2882A-ms98-a-0038 148.881000 154.683250 [silence]
sw2882A-ms98-a-0039 154.683250 161.994500 right yeah whether they they want to build a new school whether they want to put in a new reservoir or or

sw2882A-ms98-a-0042 165.647000 172.837625 but yet they're taking your tax money or they would if if some of these bond issues passed
sw2882A-ms98-a-0043 172.837625 174.378625 um
sw2882A-ms98-a-0044 174.378625 180.203750 you still didn't have any feelings one way or the other about whether they they should do it or shouldn't
sw2882A-ms98-a-0045 180.203750 188.101875 [silence]
sw2882A-ms98-a-0046 188.101875 190.463000 yeah yes

sw2882A-ms98-a-0057 217.979125 225.656125 well Louisville okay that's and but that's and Louisville's a a large city so
sw2882A-ms98-a-0058 225.656125 233.798125 yeah you didn't have local real local politics like you know like a small town would how about where you are now is that a fairly large
sw2882A-ms98-a-0059 233.798125 243.670125 [silence]
sw2882A-ms98-a-0060 243.670125 246.701000 yeah so you're in the same boat there
sw2882A-ms98-a-0061 246.701000 252.014000 and you don't really know who's who are what's going on or yeah

sw2882A-ms98-a-0066 288.770000 291.076375 just just so they can get in
sw2882A-ms98-a-0067 291.076375 299.671000 that's all and it's uh they probably should limit the the terms of office to no more than two years i mean two terms
sw2882A-ms98-a-0068 299.671000 309.891500 that way they don't get in there because some of these guys have been in there like for twenty years and they they kind of run things the way they want to run them whether whether it's uh
sw2882A-ms98-a-0069 309.891500 314.697750 [vocalized-noise] for the good of the the town or the people in the town or not
sw2882A-ms98-a-0070 314.697750 332.072750 [silence]
sw2882A-ms98-a-0071 332.072750 343.219875 yeah um some of them do now um so[cial]- social sciences and i'm not sure how far they get into politics and that uh
sw2882A-ms98-a-0072 343.219875 348.508750 [silence]
sw2882A-ms98-a-0073 348.508750 352.589125 oh the [vocalized-noise] like uh uh
sw2882A-ms98-a-0074 352.589125 357.198625 parliamentary procedure and and that sort of thing
sw2882A-ms98-a-0075 357.198625 365.594000 [silence]
sw2882A-ms98-a-0076 365.594000 367.119500 yeah

sw2882A-ms98-a-0078 368.669750 379.981625 [silence]
sw2882A-ms98-a-0079 379.981625 381.362875 yeah
sw2882A-ms98-a-0080 381.362875 382.786625 yeah
sw2882A-ms98-a-0081 382.786625 396.538125 um i don't i[t]- it's they've got they've got rules and regulations they have to follow for for government procedures but there's too many special interest groups now that are in there that that can sway an election one way or another
sw2882A-ms98-a-0082 396.538125 401.636625 um i don't even think running t[o]- to the running of
sw2882A-ms98-a-0083 401.636625 414.730250 the government now is done by the the president they say you know he's i think he's only really a figurehead he only can do certain amount of things because he's got so many people after him you know an he's he's got to look out [vocalized-noise]
sw2882A-ms98-a-0084 414.730250 422.273500 [silence]
sw2882A-ms98-a-0085 422.273500 427.981375 well you can except it costs so much money now that the average person can't do that
sw2882A-ms98-a-0086 427.981375 439.396500 um plus they're all you you have to play the people that have been in power now uh [noise] most of them are i think are are crooks 
sw2882A-ms98-a-0087 439.396500 448.813625 and you have to play their ball game they've been in there so long and if you don't then they'll you know they'll find ways to get rid of you
sw2882A-ms98-a-0088 448.813625 453.221375 no one's held accountable anymore for things that happen well
sw2882A-ms98-a-0089 453.221375 455.180625 [silence]
sw2882A-ms98-a-0090 455.180625 458.738625 oh i think that they should have crucified him
sw2882A-ms98-a-0091 458.738625 460.956500 that's what i think
sw2882A-ms98-a-0092 460.956500 464.687500 Reagan too Reagan he knew about it
sw2882A-ms98-a-0093 464.687500 470.785250 and if he didn't know the whole scope of it whoever whoever was directly under him
sw2882A-ms98-a-0094 470.785250 473.451375 [silence]
sw2882A-ms98-a-0095 473.451375 486.092750 yeah an now it's coming out where there was there was holding the hostages now they're saying that the hostages were being made political pawns when Carter and Reagan were running i mean you know
sw2882A-ms98-a-0096 486.092750 489.242250 [silence]
sw2882A-ms98-a-0097 489.242250 495.078875 he was a a a nice man i'm not sure uh he was too probably too moral
sw2882A-ms98-a-0098 495.078875 511.374000 [silence]
sw2882A-ms98-a-0099 511.374000 513.201625 yeah yeah
sw2882A-ms98-a-0100 513.201625 516.366625 [silence]
sw2882A-ms98-a-0101 516.366625 519.364750 well shortly there after yeah
sw2882A-ms98-a-0102 519.364750 523.352250 yeah so there was some collusion in there i guess
sw2882A-ms98-a-0103 523.352250 525.854875 [silence]
sw2882A-ms98-a-0104 525.854875 534.707250 and i think that's part of the problem why people don't vote anymore because of of it's just out of people's hands and they say one vote means a lot but
sw2882A-ms98-a-0105 534.707250 539.579375 it used to i don't think it one vote means means diddly anymore
sw2882A-ms98-a-0106 539.579375 543.217625 [silence]
sw2882A-ms98-a-0107 543.217625 546.673125 yeah b[ut]- but people get disillusioned too
sw2882A-ms98-a-0108 546.673125 554.410500 [silence]
sw2882A-ms98-a-0109 554.410500 562.283500 um probably one of the local do they have adult ed classes at some of the local schools
sw2882A-ms98-a-0110 562.283500 565.856625 where they teach uh you know like political science or something
sw2882A-ms98-a-0111 565.856625 567.552750 [silence]
sw2882A-ms98-a-0112 567.552750 578.615375 yeah because you because it might give you uh an insight you know uh you have to vote i've always i've always voted i even though sometimes it's hard to choose between whose running
sw2882A-ms98-a-0113 578.615375 580.030250 um
sw2882A-ms98-a-0114 580.030250 589.216250 [silence]
