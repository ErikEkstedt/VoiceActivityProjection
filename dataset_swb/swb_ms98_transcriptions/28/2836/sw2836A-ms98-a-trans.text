sw2836A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 2.064625 [noise] okay
sw2836A-ms98-a-0002 2.064625 10.072875 uh as far as you know crime in the cities i'm sure i[t]- like in yours it's pretty pretty bad
sw2836A-ms98-a-0003 10.072875 21.731500 uh probably the biggest thing we've got going now is the robberies and theft and probably murder are the two top ones that we have how about_1 you
sw2836A-ms98-a-0004 21.731500 46.962000 [silence]
sw2836A-ms98-a-0005 46.962000 48.644000 um-hum
sw2836A-ms98-a-0006 48.644000 52.624125 proba[bly]- probably right if you look at it from that stand point
sw2836A-ms98-a-0007 52.624125 60.114125 what uh is there anything that uh that you particularly are concerned with in in your particular area
sw2836A-ms98-a-0008 60.114125 62.881750 as far as security and that sort of thing
sw2836A-ms98-a-0009 62.881750 82.034375 [silence]
sw2836A-ms98-a-0010 82.034375 87.612000 um-hum [noise] do you live in a real small town or or out in the country
sw2836A-ms98-a-0011 87.612000 90.918375 how far out from the city i mean do you
sw2836A-ms98-a-0012 90.918375 101.683500 about_1 fifteen miles i live in a little suburb uh which is i guess from Dallas is twelve miles or so
sw2836A-ms98-a-0013 101.683500 110.234375 but it's pretty congested we are considered in the country but it doesn't really feel like you're in the country our major crimes in our immediate
sw2836A-ms98-a-0014 110.234375 114.821375 town uh [noise] is probably robberies house robberies
sw2836A-ms98-a-0015 114.821375 123.431875 and very few instances of you know alcohol drug uh reported however i'm sure they're there
sw2836A-ms98-a-0016 123.431875 135.305250 but uh right now our neighborhood is running about uh eighty percent of the homeowners have been robbed sometime during their their uh existence in that neighborhood
sw2836A-ms98-a-0017 135.305250 143.055625 [noise] and since that time everybody's gotten some sort of burglar system or you know uh burglar alarms
sw2836A-ms98-a-0018 143.055625 151.648000 uh and including the out uh the outer perimeter type uh devices the sensors and things like that it's cut back
sw2836A-ms98-a-0019 151.648000 162.058750 you know considerably but it it just shifts it from our neighborhood to another neighborhood to another neighborhood so [noise] it still uh remains city wide pretty pretty high
sw2836A-ms98-a-0020 162.058750 163.816625 [silence]
sw2836A-ms98-a-0021 163.816625 174.202875 [noise] uh i would say the majority of it's happening during the day uh between probably ten in the morning and three in the afternoon
sw2836A-ms98-a-0022 174.202875 186.325500 most well most families most families they are young and both people are working so they're happening during the hours they're gone from work [noise] uh so [noise] uh
sw2836A-ms98-a-0023 186.325500 195.270375 i would say that's probably their prime motivation they'll s[talk]- they'll stalk your house and uh look at your pattern and then go from there
sw2836A-ms98-a-0024 195.270375 210.116875 um they classify most of them_1 as professionals uh you get a few of them_1 that are a little bit sloppier uh just taking [noise] uh you know just junk items that they they can just get you know ten to twenty bucks for real quick
sw2836A-ms98-a-0025 210.116875 211.441000 [silence]
sw2836A-ms98-a-0026 211.441000 224.489250 probably the biggest items that uh that you get in our neighborhood or would be the high classed automobiles [vocalized-noise] Mercedes Volvos things that they can get you know big dollars for uh jewelry
sw2836A-ms98-a-0027 224.489250 228.925625 are the major targets guns that sort of stuff
sw2836A-ms98-a-0028 228.925625 232.963625 very few you know penny penny ante stuff
sw2836A-ms98-a-0029 232.963625 235.694875 [silence]
sw2836A-ms98-a-0030 235.694875 249.138375 [noise] well uh the police force for one i think they could uh definitely add to the police force and the type equipment that they use uh it's oh right now i think uh we're about 
sw2836A-ms98-a-0031 249.138375 259.391000 thirty thousand people and there's only eight officers that patrol for thirty for that amount of people which is not very many and
sw2836A-ms98-a-0032 259.391000 272.866250 [silence]
sw2836A-ms98-a-0033 272.866250 282.564625 well the course in our particular state uh we have the prison overcrowding whatever so they're giving the early release uh
sw2836A-ms98-a-0034 282.564625 288.854250 [noise] yeah and and it's i think what they need to do is stop building more jails and start giving stiffer sentences
sw2836A-ms98-a-0035 288.854250 294.494750 uh but for the that would be certainly be a deterrent
sw2836A-ms98-a-0036 294.494750 306.129250 and uh not necessarily you know uh give in to their uh human rights desires you know if they're overcrowded just keep cramming them_1 in there till they just suffocate uh
sw2836A-ms98-a-0037 306.129250 307.919250 [silence]
sw2836A-ms98-a-0038 307.919250 318.379250 uh i think they'd have to go to extra measures to make sure a person's guilty you know in a lot of cases course i i know you can't be a hundred percent foolproof uh
sw2836A-ms98-a-0039 318.379250 320.107000 [silence]
sw2836A-ms98-a-0040 320.107000 331.590250 i'd rather see it a little bit harder and have a little bit more evidence uh to convict somebody and then those convicted especially of you know murder and and uh you know major crimes uh [noise]
sw2836A-ms98-a-0041 331.590250 339.168875 to reach the life sentences and you know death penalties and follow-through with that uh
sw2836A-ms98-a-0042 339.168875 354.020125 especially you you know in the case of murder uh i know in my case i ha[d]- my wife and daughter were kidnapped during a house robbery back in eighty five and we caught the individuals got caught we uh
sw2836A-ms98-a-0043 354.020125 365.940375 we went through the court system and all that sort of thing and uh you know two counts of kidnapping uh you know the the forty five to the head you know just the the mental anguish and the whole nine yards
sw2836A-ms98-a-0044 365.940375 375.617500 uh you know the the guy only got five years and you know he was out within two months because of the parole system so what what
sw2836A-ms98-a-0045 375.617500 377.411625 do what now
sw2836A-ms98-a-0046 377.411625 378.847250 [silence]
sw2836A-ms98-a-0047 378.847250 382.893875 n[o]- no i'm not real familiar with that
sw2836A-ms98-a-0048 382.893875 385.091000 [silence]
sw2836A-ms98-a-0049 385.091000 386.613000 oh
sw2836A-ms98-a-0050 386.613000 396.424500 well the insurance companies and all that tried to tried to go after him and they said well you know he they're he has no job he has nothing there's nothing that he has that that you could go after
sw2836A-ms98-a-0051 396.424500 399.183375 [silence]
sw2836A-ms98-a-0052 399.183375 403.532125 yeah uh very seldom
sw2836A-ms98-a-0053 403.532125 410.727500 yeah they don't do that here course they pay them but they don't you don't you or the insurance companies never see any of that money
sw2836A-ms98-a-0054 410.727500 421.596125 and uh you know and they're right now they're reluctant to go after them_1 because they're you know they're they're repeat offenders they uh they've been in jail before they've been released you know several times which is another
sw2836A-ms98-a-0055 421.596125 435.121250 uh deal i hate to see [noise] but uh you know basically the guy commits you know three major crimes and uh and car theft on top of it and destroys my car he we're out you know uh you know
sw2836A-ms98-a-0056 435.121250 445.285375 fifteen thousand dollars and you know the guy gets out in two months and he goes out and commits it again fact he's back in [laughter-jail] now so what what uh [noise]
sw2836A-ms98-a-0057 445.285375 448.808125 yeah what what deterrent does he really have
sw2836A-ms98-a-0058 448.808125 461.534500 and i think in our in our particular neighborhood vigilantism is becoming a real real possibility [noise] uh we've had a couple instances where break-ins where the the people have actually you know
sw2836A-ms98-a-0059 461.534500 467.125250 shot the people and uh return offenders have
sw2836A-ms98-a-0060 467.125250 480.673000 they've actually waited for them_1 where they've robbed you know particular neighborhood they'll rob one house then other people will wait up you know and wait for somebody to do something else and try to take it in their own hands course it doesn't always work out in their favor 
sw2836A-ms98-a-0061 480.673000 488.771750 but uh nevertheless i think people are just getting fed up and saying you know you can't arrest all of us you can you know you can get some of us you can't get all of us
sw2836A-ms98-a-0062 488.771750 494.320500 [noise] uh and we're beginning to see more and more of that
sw2836A-ms98-a-0063 494.320500 497.902000 [silence]
sw2836A-ms98-a-0064 497.902000 499.448500 yeah
sw2836A-ms98-a-0065 499.448500 500.691250 [silence]
sw2836A-ms98-a-0066 500.691250 510.361250 yeah that's i mean that's certainly a a possibility an[d]- an[d]- we have had a a few cases where the guy has broken in you know during the middle of the night and gotten himself shot to death
sw2836A-ms98-a-0067 510.361250 520.146250 and uh it helps for a while but then just another different set of people come in and most of the people are transients from out outside of the state
sw2836A-ms98-a-0068 520.146250 531.268250 uh i would say probably eighty percent of them_1 that are caught they're from places like up in Oklahoma and Louisiana Arkansas you know across the the border
sw2836A-ms98-a-0069 531.268250 542.067875 so you know people who don't readily read the newspapers in our town or whatever it's not many from the local communities [noise] but uh
sw2836A-ms98-a-0070 542.067875 550.143750 it's a problem and i i just i think that the court systems need to be more accurate in in stiffer in their penalties would be a definite deterrent and
sw2836A-ms98-a-0071 550.143750 560.049125 and uh giving the uh police uh agencies a little bit more jurisdiction over what they do when they when they catch these people
sw2836A-ms98-a-0072 560.049125 571.632250 [silence]
sw2836A-ms98-a-0073 571.632250 574.333375 right [noise]
sw2836A-ms98-a-0074 574.333375 587.734500 [silence]
sw2836A-ms98-a-0075 587.734500 589.314875 um-hum
sw2836A-ms98-a-0076 589.314875 594.147750 [silence]
sw2836A-ms98-a-0077 594.147750 599.942500 i know like in my wife's case they made her feel like the criminal they they went to all all
