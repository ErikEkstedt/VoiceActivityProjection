sw2813B-ms98-a-0013 54.469250 65.268125 uh i just find it very relaxing and very enjoyable and i always hope for my memory to to fail me so after a couple of years i can pick up a story and read it again
sw2813B-ms98-a-0014 65.268125 68.536625 [silence]

sw2813B-ms98-a-0020 95.824125 103.734625 yeah i started reading them years and years ago and i it's and i i'm not really much of a mystery
sw2813B-ms98-a-0021 103.734625 110.196625 reader although i've always liked Sherlock Holmes and then somebody turned me on to a guy named Dick Frances
sw2813B-ms98-a-0022 110.196625 121.283125 um and he's uh a former jockey and he writes mystery stories and they always involve horse racing in one form or another he's very very good if uh you've never read him
sw2813B-ms98-a-0023 121.283125 124.103500 that would be a great opportunity
sw2813B-ms98-a-0024 124.103500 129.363375 his name is Dick Frances and any book store owner will know who Dick Frances is
sw2813B-ms98-a-0025 129.363375 130.727875 [silence]
sw2813B-ms98-a-0026 130.727875 139.770000 and you can pick up any of his stuff and you can just sort of try it and if you like his style well he's written i'd say twenty or twenty five
sw2813B-ms98-a-0027 139.770000 140.943125 [silence]
sw2813B-ms98-a-0028 140.943125 144.753500 novels you know he's quite quite clever

sw2813B-ms98-a-0034 175.577500 186.961375 uh Michener of doing that you know i read some of his early stuff and then it seemed like his later stuff they would be these long long long passages that were just of inferior quality it
sw2813B-ms98-a-0035 186.961375 189.632125 [silence]
sw2813B-ms98-a-0036 189.632125 203.853875 yeah i mean i just got the feeling that he sort of has a coterie of of students and he says okay go write three chapters on this and he and he kind of he might write some stuff i don't think he writes all his stuff every word i may be wrong
sw2813B-ms98-a-0037 203.853875 212.075625 [silence]
sw2813B-ms98-a-0038 212.075625 213.814750 yeah
sw2813B-ms98-a-0039 213.814750 218.856250 i've read a couple of his things i- i just wasn't that crazy about him
sw2813B-ms98-a-0040 218.856250 223.178250 which really puts me in the i know in the vast minority [laughter]

sw2813B-ms98-a-0052 287.111375 297.197875 i read Dune years ago and i again you you i uh i just did not care for Dune i read through it all it was laborious i- i
sw2813B-ms98-a-0053 297.197875 303.616625 felt i had to get through it and when i put it down i never wanted to read another thing by that guy again
sw2813B-ms98-a-0054 303.616625 304.967500 [laughter]
sw2813B-ms98-a-0055 304.967500 309.709000 [silence]

sw2813B-ms98-a-0059 314.986000 320.773500 but again i realize i mean i all my friends were saying how great Dune was and i just could not
sw2813B-ms98-a-0060 320.773500 325.940250 could not get into it i read the whole thing but i didn't en[joy]- didn't enjoy it that much
sw2813B-ms98-a-0061 325.940250 327.252000 [silence]
sw2813B-ms98-a-0062 327.252000 333.033000 i really read a lot of science fiction and Asimov is one of my favorite authors
sw2813B-ms98-a-0063 333.033000 340.693625 i think his stuff is is great just going back to his very early works and almost anything he writes i try to read
sw2813B-ms98-a-0064 340.693625 359.456250 [silence]
sw2813B-ms98-a-0065 359.456250 361.540125 yeah
sw2813B-ms98-a-0066 361.540125 374.822750 interesting and i was just crazy about Tolkien i read his stuff and i reread it and i read the whole twelve hundred pages aloud to my son when he was uh a young boy when he was about eight or nine
sw2813B-ms98-a-0067 374.822750 382.213500 we would just read ten pages every night and i just did that you know for a half a year until i'd read the whole thing out loud
sw2813B-ms98-a-0068 382.213500 383.578000 [silence]
sw2813B-ms98-a-0069 383.578000 384.994625 and uh

sw2813B-ms98-a-0074 405.592500 412.780625 well uh [noise] uh being a college professor there's just a certain amount of academic reading i do as a matter of course 
sw2813B-ms98-a-0075 412.780625 414.061625 [silence]
sw2813B-ms98-a-0076 414.061625 419.530375 w[ell]- we[ll]- well yeah forced is probably not too strong a word but
sw2813B-ms98-a-0077 419.530375 428.017500 to keep up in your field you usually have to do some uh some technical reading but uh i actually like um
sw2813B-ms98-a-0078 428.017500 436.106375 for technical reading i like to read what i call uh soft core science like uh Discovery Magazine
sw2813B-ms98-a-0079 436.106375 439.531375 which i like very much and uh
sw2813B-ms98-a-0080 439.531375 445.423750 and then uh National Science Foundation puts out an excellent publication called Mosaic
sw2813B-ms98-a-0081 445.423750 453.233500 with uh th[e]- and they get some of the best s[cholars]- scholars and scientists in the country to write articles that can be understood
sw2813B-ms98-a-0082 453.233500 459.896750 they're not highly technical but they're not probably not as simplified as in Discovery
sw2813B-ms98-a-0083 459.896750 470.803375 but they're very good except i couldn't i just got on their list somehow because at one time i did some research for them_1 and i'm not really sure how one would go about getting this but it's it's excellent
sw2813B-ms98-a-0084 470.803375 472.468500 uh
sw2813B-ms98-a-0085 472.468500 476.966500 for finding out what's going on in fields other than your own

sw2813B-ms98-a-0087 480.309000 481.962375 i don't believe so

sw2813B-ms98-a-0094 511.887875 513.443875 i don't know
