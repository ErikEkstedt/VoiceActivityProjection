sw2809B-ms98-a-0002 21.525500 23.449500 um-hum
sw2809B-ms98-a-0003 23.449500 24.730625 [silence]
sw2809B-ms98-a-0004 24.730625 37.991375 yeah well i mean that's that's certainly true i guess i'm i'm confused uh by what it means to be a threat to the United States and so i'm not sure i even recognize the United States as anything to be threatened um
sw2809B-ms98-a-0005 37.991375 45.597125 the uh i guess the main issue is is that it it seems to me that the Soviet Union is breaking up into it's own internal problems
sw2809B-ms98-a-0006 45.597125 52.615000 um and it would certainly be nice if the various um republics seceded
sw2809B-ms98-a-0007 52.615000 60.604625 on the other hand i also think it would be very nice if the various states in our union seceded uh but that's beside the [laughter-point] uh
sw2809B-ms98-a-0008 60.604625 69.870000 and it's much less than clear to me that as a military power um there's going to be anything left uh given that anything like that happens
sw2809B-ms98-a-0009 69.870000 76.420250 uh they've got enough problems keeping their own people happy to worry about you know nuking other people who aren't bothering them
sw2809B-ms98-a-0010 76.420250 90.413750 [silence]
sw2809B-ms98-a-0011 90.413750 92.235375 um-hum
sw2809B-ms98-a-0012 92.235375 107.456875 [silence]
sw2809B-ms98-a-0013 107.456875 114.629000 i guess i'm co[mmunist]- why is why is communism {antiethical} to democracy i can understand why it's {antiethical} to capitalism
sw2809B-ms98-a-0014 114.629000 116.693250 [silence]
sw2809B-ms98-a-0015 116.693250 117.981000 okay
sw2809B-ms98-a-0016 117.981000 122.662750 uh all right but we've already got a lot of {anticapitalism} in this country
sw2809B-ms98-a-0017 122.662750 123.691375 [silence]
sw2809B-ms98-a-0018 123.691375 125.258875 um
sw2809B-ms98-a-0019 125.258875 129.997000 [silence]
sw2809B-ms98-a-0020 129.997000 132.117500 that could be that could be
sw2809B-ms98-a-0021 132.117500 139.054875 uh but certainly the latest rumors in Congress right now is let's soak the rich some more so we can spread out the money
sw2809B-ms98-a-0022 139.054875 141.635750 and that's certainly communism as far as i can tell
sw2809B-ms98-a-0023 141.635750 142.698125 uh [laughter]
sw2809B-ms98-a-0024 142.698125 146.719000 so um you know they might be perfectly happy to sit back and wait for it to happen [noise]
sw2809B-ms98-a-0025 146.719000 148.026875 um
sw2809B-ms98-a-0026 148.026875 158.800375 and they so so i guess since the primary question is whether or not it's a military problem that's less than clear to me i mean if they're smart they're just going to let us head toward communism on our own very merry way
sw2809B-ms98-a-0027 158.800375 165.948875 and there seems to be enough people in our country who are happy to do that sort of thing because they think they'd get more out of it that way
sw2809B-ms98-a-0028 165.948875 168.070000 um
sw2809B-ms98-a-0029 168.070000 171.425250 so from that point of view i don't consider them a threat
sw2809B-ms98-a-0030 171.425250 175.524000 i don't think they're going to you know somehow import communism to us
sw2809B-ms98-a-0031 175.524000 183.096250 [silence]
sw2809B-ms98-a-0032 183.096250 184.290500 um-hum

sw2809B-ms98-a-0034 189.502875 190.716875 right
sw2809B-ms98-a-0035 190.716875 194.149500 [silence]
sw2809B-ms98-a-0036 194.149500 198.392500 that's true that's that can be a frightening thought
sw2809B-ms98-a-0037 198.392500 199.630000 um
sw2809B-ms98-a-0038 199.630000 201.634875 yep yep
sw2809B-ms98-a-0039 201.634875 202.835000 yeah
sw2809B-ms98-a-0040 202.835000 203.882000 [silence]
sw2809B-ms98-a-0041 203.882000 205.337750 um
sw2809B-ms98-a-0042 205.337750 212.105375 of course that's not a good way to win friends but yeah i mean i- i think there's also the whole third world issue uh with him
sw2809B-ms98-a-0043 212.105375 217.967625 with uh the Soviet Union having um supported uh Iraq
sw2809B-ms98-a-0044 217.967625 223.077125 uh previously and and so there there's a whole lot of political possibilities um
sw2809B-ms98-a-0045 223.077125 229.577500 but you know just just to put this in perspective i mean George Bush was recently in the hospital
sw2809B-ms98-a-0046 229.577500 238.397750 and so for a moment Dan Quayle might have been [laughter] uh having his finger on the trigger and God knows what that would have done uh [laughter]
sw2809B-ms98-a-0047 238.397750 239.900000 [silence]
sw2809B-ms98-a-0048 239.900000 241.102500 yeah

sw2809B-ms98-a-0050 242.381250 244.356625 it's a joke [laughter]

sw2809B-ms98-a-0060 267.504500 271.142250 uh i think so i can't think off hand who
sw2809B-ms98-a-0061 271.142250 272.368375 [silence]
sw2809B-ms98-a-0062 272.368375 274.010625 yeah
sw2809B-ms98-a-0063 274.010625 278.508125 i mean i just can't imagine voting for anybody that has Quayle on their ticket
sw2809B-ms98-a-0064 278.508125 283.593125 [silence]
sw2809B-ms98-a-0065 283.593125 290.134875 right and also he was basically unknown so i mean you're just like okay so it's it's Bush and somebody else
sw2809B-ms98-a-0066 290.134875 294.510875 [silence]
sw2809B-ms98-a-0067 294.510875 295.590875 um-hum

sw2809B-ms98-a-0069 299.557750 301.375375 right right

sw2809B-ms98-a-0074 310.427625 317.356875 [silence]
sw2809B-ms98-a-0075 317.356875 318.996375 you don't think so
sw2809B-ms98-a-0076 318.996375 323.450625 [silence]
sw2809B-ms98-a-0077 323.450625 334.002625 i just i can't see them maintaining the missile bases in fact i think if the Soviet government starts retreating you know because of these civil wars and stuff the first thing they're going to do is close down the missile bases in the republics
sw2809B-ms98-a-0078 334.002625 336.982875 because_1 they're not going to want them to fall into the Republic's hands
sw2809B-ms98-a-0079 336.982875 338.048875 [silence]
sw2809B-ms98-a-0080 338.048875 340.992500 might be used against them that's right
sw2809B-ms98-a-0081 340.992500 342.474125 [silence]
sw2809B-ms98-a-0082 342.474125 351.280750 and so i think just from that there's going to be some limited amounts of disarmament they'll still be republics with the missiles the ones that are under the firmer control of the of the Soviets
sw2809B-ms98-a-0083 351.280750 355.355375 uh but certainly you know like Lithuania and stuff i think would lose theirs
sw2809B-ms98-a-0084 355.355375 359.080125 [silence]
sw2809B-ms98-a-0085 359.080125 361.023375 so it was good talking to you
sw2809B-ms98-a-0086 361.023375 362.822000 okeydoke bye
sw2809B-ms98-a-0087 362.822000 365.069375 [noise]
