sw2809A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 10.540375 so i personally uh do consider the Soviet Union a threat i- i- i think that although there's been some fundamental changes and that there's uh uh the uh
sw2809A-ms98-a-0002 10.540375 22.420250 the mood for change that there's a lot of change left to happen and that there's still uh communism which is fundamentally opposed to democracy and there's still missiles
sw2809A-ms98-a-0003 22.420250 34.881125 yeah 
sw2809A-ms98-a-0004 34.881125 36.484250 oh really
sw2809A-ms98-a-0005 36.484250 45.173875 [silence]
sw2809A-ms98-a-0006 45.173875 46.337250 yes
sw2809A-ms98-a-0007 46.337250 56.475500 [silence]
sw2809A-ms98-a-0008 56.475500 57.943750 [laughter]
sw2809A-ms98-a-0009 57.943750 59.778125 right
sw2809A-ms98-a-0010 59.778125 69.114750 [silence]
sw2809A-ms98-a-0011 69.114750 70.286875 right
sw2809A-ms98-a-0012 70.286875 75.496500 [silence]
sw2809A-ms98-a-0013 75.496500 86.320000 right well i guess that that that brings up a question is it their i think in in the long term we could see a a situation where there are in [vocalized-noise] incredible civil wars
sw2809A-ms98-a-0014 86.320000 90.780000 and that the the structure of the country breaks down and there's strife and much much death
sw2809A-ms98-a-0015 90.780000 104.582250 but until that happens be[tween]- between now and then there's a lot of other uh events that could happen including a resurgence of communism with uh violent uh backlash against democracy
sw2809A-ms98-a-0016 104.582250 108.245750 wh[ich]- which is where we could be in threatened i guess you'd say
sw2809A-ms98-a-0017 108.245750 113.736625 [silence]
sw2809A-ms98-a-0018 113.736625 117.297125 i'm sorry you you're right i'm am meaning to say capitalism
sw2809A-ms98-a-0019 117.297125 122.218375 [silence]
sw2809A-ms98-a-0020 122.218375 124.372625 yes that's true uh-huh
sw2809A-ms98-a-0021 124.372625 129.063750 but not necessarily enough from the Soviet Union's people's point of view
sw2809A-ms98-a-0022 129.063750 130.064000 [silence]
sw2809A-ms98-a-0023 130.064000 131.881250 i- yeah
sw2809A-ms98-a-0024 131.881250 138.496875 [silence]
sw2809A-ms98-a-0025 138.496875 139.646125 yeah
sw2809A-ms98-a-0026 139.646125 141.052000 [silence]
sw2809A-ms98-a-0027 141.052000 142.332625 [laughter-right]

sw2809A-ms98-a-0029 144.746000 146.558875 [silence]
sw2809A-ms98-a-0030 146.558875 147.776125 that's right
sw2809A-ms98-a-0031 147.776125 157.996875 [silence]
sw2809A-ms98-a-0032 157.996875 159.425625 that's right
sw2809A-ms98-a-0033 159.425625 165.147500 [silence]
sw2809A-ms98-a-0034 165.147500 166.840750 right um-hum
sw2809A-ms98-a-0035 166.840750 170.813375 [silence]
sw2809A-ms98-a-0036 170.813375 172.005625 i see
sw2809A-ms98-a-0037 172.005625 174.903750 [silence]
sw2809A-ms98-a-0038 174.903750 177.471375 i- i agree with that i don't believe that will happen
sw2809A-ms98-a-0039 177.471375 190.048500 the um well one thing that's cu[rrent]- of interest is is if the Soviet Union's structure does break down and there is civil war at the end of those civil wars or during those civil wars in whose hands will those missiles be
sw2809A-ms98-a-0040 190.048500 194.519625 and there are a lot [laughter-of] [laughter-them] uh scattered throughout the many many republics
sw2809A-ms98-a-0041 194.519625 197.677500 [silence]
sw2809A-ms98-a-0042 197.677500 200.002375 right almost a terroristic thought
sw2809A-ms98-a-0043 200.002375 202.308000 you know come help us or we'll bomb you
sw2809A-ms98-a-0044 202.308000 207.743125 [silence]
sw2809A-ms98-a-0045 207.743125 209.246750 that's
sw2809A-ms98-a-0046 209.246750 217.602500 [silence]
sw2809A-ms98-a-0047 217.602500 218.954750 right
sw2809A-ms98-a-0048 218.954750 232.130500 [silence]
sw2809A-ms98-a-0049 232.130500 234.472750 [laughter]
sw2809A-ms98-a-0050 234.472750 236.172250 that's right
sw2809A-ms98-a-0051 236.172250 242.915000 i know it's almost amazing how little you hear about Dan Quayle and when you do it's usually totally
sw2809A-ms98-a-0052 242.915000 246.494875 yeah yeah he still wants to send people to Mars
sw2809A-ms98-a-0053 246.494875 249.926500 the guy's uh l[ame]- l[ame]- l[ame]- lame to say the least
sw2809A-ms98-a-0054 249.926500 251.015250 [silence]
sw2809A-ms98-a-0055 251.015250 256.410000 oh well so that's uh [laughter-what] what's going to be real interesting is if when they have the next presidential elections
sw2809A-ms98-a-0056 256.410000 259.090125 if Bush is going to run with Quayle again
sw2809A-ms98-a-0057 259.090125 267.636125 or if he's [laughter-going] [laughter-to] [laughter-run] with someone else which i think would be uh i wonder if that's if there's precedent for that where uh there's uh same president but a different vice president
sw2809A-ms98-a-0058 267.636125 268.640500 [silence]
sw2809A-ms98-a-0059 268.640500 269.835750 is it
sw2809A-ms98-a-0060 269.835750 272.971750 but without something like death or impeachment [laughter]
sw2809A-ms98-a-0061 272.971750 274.737000 i- i- i can't recall
sw2809A-ms98-a-0062 274.737000 277.691250 [silence]
sw2809A-ms98-a-0063 277.691250 285.572500 yeah that's right i guess in the last elections it was it was the lesser of several evils but from the
sw2809A-ms98-a-0064 285.572500 287.005375 yeah that's right
sw2809A-ms98-a-0065 287.005375 289.514500 [silence]
sw2809A-ms98-a-0066 289.514500 290.648250 yeah
sw2809A-ms98-a-0067 290.648250 295.072125 oh well so let's see back to the that key issue uh
sw2809A-ms98-a-0068 295.072125 300.952000 [noise] the the other part of the question was what would uh what would have to happen to convince me
sw2809A-ms98-a-0069 300.952000 305.216625 and i'd say seems to me uh that the missiles are the threat
sw2809A-ms98-a-0070 305.216625 305.730500 [noise]
sw2809A-ms98-a-0071 305.730500 309.709500 and so what would have to happen is a complete disarmament
sw2809A-ms98-a-0072 309.709500 317.680250 uh and uh that's i you know i'd love to see that happen but i doubt it's going to happen in the next fifty years
sw2809A-ms98-a-0073 317.680250 319.908000 [noise] i don't no
sw2809A-ms98-a-0074 319.908000 324.650375 personally i- i- i re[ally]- as i said i would really love to see it happen but i just
sw2809A-ms98-a-0075 324.650375 330.107000 [silence]
sw2809A-ms98-a-0076 330.107000 331.405500 um-hum

sw2809A-ms98-a-0080 336.124250 343.223750 i see under the fear that that uh M[oscow]- Moscow gets bombed fir[st]- that's a good point that's a very good point in fact 
sw2809A-ms98-a-0081 343.223750 350.635375 [silence]
