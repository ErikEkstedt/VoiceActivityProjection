sw2804B-ms98-a-0004 5.670750 13.979250 i follow i've been a long time Cincinnati Reds fan because when i was growing up and i was five years old i wanted to be a catcher 
sw2804B-ms98-a-0005 13.979250 22.206250 so i was a big Johnny Bench fan so i've been through the Re[ds]- with the Reds since you know nineteen seventy
sw2804B-ms98-a-0006 22.206250 31.939000 and i remember the Seventy World Series like i said i was only five years old then but i had to give a report to my dad every because that was when they played World Series games in the afternoons sometimes
sw2804B-ms98-a-0007 31.939000 33.866750 and

sw2804B-ms98-a-0009 35.071625 46.413375 i've kind of gotten away from them until the last couple of years because i didn't really know many players and their team but i also being from the Indiana area i like the Cubs and the White Sox
sw2804B-ms98-a-0010 46.413375 48.480375 so i kind of follow those two teams
sw2804B-ms98-a-0011 48.480375 55.517000 a little bit and you know since moving down here the Rangers you know i've been picking up on them a little bit
sw2804B-ms98-a-0012 55.517000 56.847875 and uh
sw2804B-ms98-a-0013 56.847875 63.925125 it looks like they could do all right this year and uh of course they're in there with the ri[ght]- White Sox i believe and they're in their division so
sw2804B-ms98-a-0014 63.925125 68.917375 the White Sox headed for probably another good year i hope what about yourself
sw2804B-ms98-a-0015 68.917375 72.070625 [silence]

sw2804B-ms98-a-0038 140.811125 152.700250 i i just like uh i like the White Sox i've never really got into them and then this friend of mine was just a hard core White Sox so he took me to a game and you know i think they're you know they're really neat because they're such a young team
sw2804B-ms98-a-0039 152.700250 155.490875 actually the youngest team in baseball and they got some
sw2804B-ms98-a-0040 155.490875 162.472125 you know the last three or four years their number one picks you know they're all suited up and playing for them
sw2804B-ms98-a-0041 162.472125 164.550625 and the draft and uh
sw2804B-ms98-a-0042 164.550625 169.568000 you got to like that you know and building the team through draft picks and stuff like that
sw2804B-ms98-a-0043 169.568000 170.594000 [silence]
sw2804B-ms98-a-0044 170.594000 182.930875 yeah it does hopefully some of their players will come through and they got Tim Raines and a veteran and they got Carlton Fisk he's you know still pretty solid a lot of experience
sw2804B-ms98-a-0045 182.930875 184.120000 [silence]
sw2804B-ms98-a-0046 184.120000 185.493750 but uh

sw2804B-ms98-a-0058 238.727250 243.387375 yeah i don't i never really followed them all i knew uh
sw2804B-ms98-a-0059 243.387375 253.998625 kind of watched them a little bit in the seventies there again you know cause i was a little catcher in baseball i liked to watch a Jim Sundberg and uh like a Jeff Burroughs
sw2804B-ms98-a-0060 253.998625 255.066875 uh
sw2804B-ms98-a-0061 255.066875 262.491375 uh forget who else used to play for them but uh yeah those guys were were really tough

sw2804B-ms98-a-0066 278.628125 285.294375 yeah
sw2804B-ms98-a-0067 285.294375 288.942375 i was watching the game yesterday and they had had bases loaded
sw2804B-ms98-a-0068 288.942375 291.979125 and they tried a uh a squeeze play
sw2804B-ms98-a-0069 291.979125 298.539500 and uh i just couldn't understand that i forget whose who was batting and but uh
sw2804B-ms98-a-0070 298.539500 300.686375 i don't know i just [vocalized-noise]
sw2804B-ms98-a-0071 300.686375 303.398750 i couldn't understand that move there was only one out
sw2804B-ms98-a-0072 303.398750 315.432000 and it's like you know give the guy a cut you know you got bases loaded you know one mistake cause a lot of these players aren't used to bunting that much and it's a easy double play
sw2804B-ms98-a-0073 315.432000 316.614375 but
sw2804B-ms98-a-0074 316.614375 325.070875 [silence]

sw2804B-ms98-a-0111 439.218125 448.181500 yeah it's uh it's just too bad it's you know like the players that do drugs or do you know are alcoholics they just have a problem
sw2804B-ms98-a-0112 448.181500 449.780000 and
sw2804B-ms98-a-0113 449.780000 454.140000 and it's too bad it carried over and has hurt his image and everything else
