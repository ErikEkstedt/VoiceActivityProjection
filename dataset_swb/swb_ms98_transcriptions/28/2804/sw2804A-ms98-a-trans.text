sw2804A-ms98-a-0016 68.998875 73.180625 oh i guess mainly the the Rangers such as they are
sw2804A-ms98-a-0017 73.180625 79.082875 they do seem to have a pretty tough division though with Oakland and Kansas City and White Sox all uh
sw2804A-ms98-a-0018 79.082875 80.285625 jammed in there
sw2804A-ms98-a-0019 80.285625 81.866375 [silence]
sw2804A-ms98-a-0020 81.866375 85.971875 oh i get to i don't know quite a few in the summer
sw2804A-ms98-a-0021 85.971875 106.199375 [silence]
sw2804A-ms98-a-0022 106.199375 111.384625 yeah it looked like they're starting off kind of shaky but they they've gone i guess over five hundred now
sw2804A-ms98-a-0023 111.384625 112.409875 [silence]
sw2804A-ms98-a-0024 112.409875 117.224750 i was hoping that no hitter that he threw would would get them fired up a little bit
sw2804A-ms98-a-0025 117.224750 119.031375 but it's hard hard to tell
sw2804A-ms98-a-0026 119.031375 120.688250 [silence]
sw2804A-ms98-a-0027 120.688250 124.727375 uh i was trying to think they were up in a stand at Detroit
sw2804A-ms98-a-0028 124.727375 125.803750 [silence]
sw2804A-ms98-a-0029 125.803750 127.677375 i don't know if they're playing today or not

sw2804A-ms98-a-0037 168.966000 171.019125 yeah it says a lot for their future
sw2804A-ms98-a-0038 171.019125 188.946250 [silence]
sw2804A-ms98-a-0039 188.946250 197.464875 oh i don't really follow them a whole lot um i i hear about them occasionally i've got a friend whose a a trainer for one of their farm clubs
sw2804A-ms98-a-0040 197.464875 208.448125 i think so [noise] we hear off and on about them they've never really done a whole lot i mean they're up and down kind of like the Rangers are most of the time
sw2804A-ms98-a-0041 208.448125 218.815500 [silence]
sw2804A-ms98-a-0042 218.815500 227.416375 it's been probably three or four years since they were i think they finished second in their division i don't remember what they ended up last year third or fourth i guess
sw2804A-ms98-a-0043 227.416375 231.540000 [silence]
sw2804A-ms98-a-0044 231.540000 238.304875 yeah they have been off and on uh maybe maybe three or four times since they've been here
sw2804A-ms98-a-0045 238.304875 253.117000 [silence]
sw2804A-ms98-a-0046 253.117000 254.294250 uh-huh
sw2804A-ms98-a-0047 254.294250 261.650250 [silence]
sw2804A-ms98-a-0048 261.650250 273.261500 well they've been like a lot of teams and the minute they do real badly in the past they just got got rid of their manager this is Valentine's the first manager they've had in on you know any kind of length of time
sw2804A-ms98-a-0049 273.261500 277.044250 and so hopefully he'll eventually put something together
sw2804A-ms98-a-0050 277.044250 278.982000 [silence]
sw2804A-ms98-a-0051 278.982000 284.404000 i i can't [laughter] i don't know uh sometimes i think he is and sometimes i wonder
sw2804A-ms98-a-0052 284.404000 302.722625 [silence]
sw2804A-ms98-a-0053 302.722625 303.933125 uh-huh
sw2804A-ms98-a-0054 303.933125 312.405750 [silence]
sw2804A-ms98-a-0055 312.405750 314.009375 yeah true
sw2804A-ms98-a-0056 314.009375 316.297500 [silence]
sw2804A-ms98-a-0057 316.297500 325.424375 i guess i was feeling pretty confident about the team Valentine this year until uh he got mad at Pete Incaviglia and just cut him for because he was upset at him
sw2804A-ms98-a-0058 325.424375 326.477500 [silence]
sw2804A-ms98-a-0059 326.477500 333.916500 well i i can understand his point i thought it was kind of childish to just cut him instead of trying to trade him because then Detroit picks him up and
sw2804A-ms98-a-0060 333.916500 337.946000 he started out real good for them and he he's gotten kind of shaky now
sw2804A-ms98-a-0061 337.946000 341.335125 and i think they should have at least gotten something for him
sw2804A-ms98-a-0062 341.335125 347.781250 [silence]
sw2804A-ms98-a-0063 347.781250 348.901375 yeah
sw2804A-ms98-a-0064 348.901375 352.097625 [silence]
sw2804A-ms98-a-0065 352.097625 353.236375 i think so
sw2804A-ms98-a-0066 353.236375 358.852500 yeah
sw2804A-ms98-a-0067 358.852500 364.680500 yeah i think i think as long as he produces he and Franco they they run kind of hot and cold too
sw2804A-ms98-a-0068 364.680500 369.858000 i think Franco hit a home run was it last night to win the game
sw2804A-ms98-a-0069 369.858000 372.205250 [silence]
sw2804A-ms98-a-0070 372.205250 378.174625 i think they won six to five and i think that was on his he hit a home run at the end and broke the tie up
sw2804A-ms98-a-0071 378.174625 386.140875 [silence]
sw2804A-ms98-a-0072 386.140875 386.932000 hum

sw2804A-ms98-a-0075 391.992375 393.120500 [silence]
sw2804A-ms98-a-0076 393.120500 398.804125 yeah i think the Rangers have th[e]- the pitching staff they need if they would just produce some offense they might do all right
sw2804A-ms98-a-0077 398.804125 406.338375 [silence]
sw2804A-ms98-a-0078 406.338375 412.693625 yeah you said you were a Cincinnati fan has uh all this brouhaha with Pete Rose over the years
sw2804A-ms98-a-0079 412.693625 416.177250 caused caused you any distaste for them or
sw2804A-ms98-a-0080 416.177250 431.084625 [silence]

sw2804A-ms98-a-0089 454.165125 459.746500 well but it didn't didn't seem to really hurt the team in fact seemed to kind of fire them up and make them work harder
sw2804A-ms98-a-0090 459.746500 461.361125 after he was gone
sw2804A-ms98-a-0091 461.361125 462.827875 [silence]
