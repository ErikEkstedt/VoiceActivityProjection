sw2823A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 3.702375 hi
sw2823A-ms98-a-0002 3.702375 17.377250 we sure do as a matter of fact i do the finances in the family and what i do is take uh entire take home pay and then i like divvy it up into sections into the house
sw2823A-ms98-a-0003 17.377250 30.035625 into the car into the utiliti[es]- anything that's to do with the house like utilities or electric or anything like that goes into the house budget
sw2823A-ms98-a-0004 30.035625 44.739250 and then i have one for the food and one for um and and each of these is allotted a certain amount of money and hopefully [laughter] we stay within that budget and then uh we have some for uh debt
sw2823A-ms98-a-0005 44.739250 52.020000 and some for just plain family you know like if the kids need clothes or if um
sw2823A-ms98-a-0006 52.020000 53.653625 oh i don't know
sw2823A-ms98-a-0007 53.653625 61.974750 you know if som[ething]- something in the h[ouse]- well the house one gets the money for the budget if we need something new in the house or something like that 
sw2823A-ms98-a-0008 61.974750 63.914625 and that's pretty much how we do it
sw2823A-ms98-a-0009 63.914625 67.395500 [silence]
sw2823A-ms98-a-0010 67.395500 68.506000 yeah
sw2823A-ms98-a-0011 68.506000 81.208750 um-hum it does uh now the way that we can really get off track is if i start to pull money from something and put it into another into another budget like if i
sw2823A-ms98-a-0012 81.208750 83.660375 have money put into the house budget
sw2823A-ms98-a-0013 83.660375 92.048375 and all the bills that go with that and i start siph[on]- siphoning money out of that like into the food bill budget
sw2823A-ms98-a-0014 92.048375 104.906625 um to buy more food and i don't do that usually but when it does happen then i get into problems with you know then i have to take money from somewhere else to pay the bills on the house
sw2823A-ms98-a-0015 104.906625 114.526750 and i don't like to do that then you can get really into trouble and that doesn't happen very often because i'm pretty strict i don't usually take money from anywhere
sw2823A-ms98-a-0016 114.526750 116.623875 unless i absolutely have to
sw2823A-ms98-a-0017 116.623875 120.071625 [silence]

sw2823A-ms98-a-0028 174.868250 189.647875 uh it's it's kind of a good thing with my husband's company we can allot a certain amount of money and all of our we have four children each of our children have a savings account and then there's a basic savings account like a family one
sw2823A-ms98-a-0029 189.647875 197.917625 and what the his um company does for us is we allot a certain amount and like you said uh
sw2823A-ms98-a-0030 197.917625 211.997125 they ta[ke]- they just take that straight out of the paycheck and put it right in the savings account we don't even see that money uh we can take it i mean it's w[ell]- available to us if we want to take it out but uh we just try not to touch that 
sw2823A-ms98-a-0031 211.997125 218.391000 but you know and so we try not to even take that as part of our budget we just try to put that right away in savings
sw2823A-ms98-a-0032 218.391000 231.220750 it's very difficult sometimes to to not think and say well God we have a little bit in savings let's [laughter-you] [laughter-know] but you have to be quite um adamant and say you're not going to touch that so
sw2823A-ms98-a-0033 231.220750 234.304500 [silence]
sw2823A-ms98-a-0034 234.304500 235.506500 um-hum

sw2823A-ms98-a-0043 265.973375 267.174000 [silence]
sw2823A-ms98-a-0044 267.174000 279.161875 yeah we don't touch the kids we do have the joint one like you said and we do fluctuate money in that one if we want to and then there's one other thing that we have and and we don't touch the money in that one
sw2823A-ms98-a-0045 279.161875 280.358750 so
sw2823A-ms98-a-0046 280.358750 284.566625 [silence]
sw2823A-ms98-a-0047 284.566625 287.924500 um-hum that's really good

sw2823A-ms98-a-0050 293.677750 303.149000 [silence]
sw2823A-ms98-a-0051 303.149000 309.048750 you know and that's so important because today things can be so expensive they really can
sw2823A-ms98-a-0052 309.048750 318.164000 [silence]
sw2823A-ms98-a-0053 318.164000 320.092875 that's right exactly
sw2823A-ms98-a-0054 320.092875 326.635375 [silence]
sw2823A-ms98-a-0055 326.635375 332.356500 it's just not possible to do it like maybe we did it when when we went to school
sw2823A-ms98-a-0056 332.356500 339.376125 [silence]
sw2823A-ms98-a-0057 339.376125 340.571875 yeah
sw2823A-ms98-a-0058 340.571875 341.970875 it's too hard
sw2823A-ms98-a-0059 341.970875 344.249875 [silence]
sw2823A-ms98-a-0060 344.249875 345.450250 that's right

sw2823A-ms98-a-0066 360.439625 362.469875 wouldn't that be great
sw2823A-ms98-a-0067 362.469875 365.245750 [silence]
sw2823A-ms98-a-0068 365.245750 374.731500 i think that all of those things are really important and and uh the only reason i even went to a budget was i found that we
sw2823A-ms98-a-0069 374.731500 376.489750 um
sw2823A-ms98-a-0070 376.489750 381.251500 we would oh i can't think of the word like
sw2823A-ms98-a-0071 381.251500 383.270000 [silence]
sw2823A-ms98-a-0072 383.270000 395.706375 or money would go through the cracks you know and at the end of the thing we'd go what happened to all that money the extra we had the overflow you know and it just siphons itself away somewhere into the air [laughter] and so
sw2823A-ms98-a-0073 395.706375 400.951000 [silence]
sw2823A-ms98-a-0074 400.951000 403.005250 yeah yeah
sw2823A-ms98-a-0075 403.005250 407.940000 [silence]
sw2823A-ms98-a-0076 407.940000 410.114250 it's hard to keep track isn't it
sw2823A-ms98-a-0077 410.114250 413.501750 [silence]
sw2823A-ms98-a-0078 413.501750 414.644375 um-hum
sw2823A-ms98-a-0079 414.644375 417.252125 [silence]

sw2823A-ms98-a-0082 420.236125 422.288000 i think that's great
sw2823A-ms98-a-0083 422.288000 432.374250 [silence]
sw2823A-ms98-a-0084 432.374250 434.049000 yeah
sw2823A-ms98-a-0085 434.049000 447.368625 i didn't used to have uh a money allotted out for debt service until um i just had a baby seven months ago and she had extensive problems and
sw2823A-ms98-a-0086 447.368625 459.854250 and [laughter] the the specialists and the hospitals that she had to have you know uh she was in the hospital for like a month and the money that accumulated in those i found i had to make
sw2823A-ms98-a-0087 459.854250 465.459500 that into the budget to start paying those off and th[en]- i mean the insurance
sw2823A-ms98-a-0088 465.459500 466.448750 pardon
sw2823A-ms98-a-0089 466.448750 467.231000 [silence]
sw2823A-ms98-a-0090 467.231000 468.606250 yeah

sw2823A-ms98-a-0093 472.797000 474.354125 [silence]
sw2823A-ms98-a-0094 474.354125 478.047375 our insurance was wonderful but it didn't cover everything you know and so
sw2823A-ms98-a-0095 478.047375 485.118625 yeah fine you have to um do some of those things and and when money is involved it can really get expensive
sw2823A-ms98-a-0096 485.118625 492.126625 so anyway that's about how we handle our finances and and uh that seems to work pretty well for us
sw2823A-ms98-a-0097 492.126625 494.961625 [silence]
sw2823A-ms98-a-0098 494.961625 496.108500 um-hum

sw2823A-ms98-a-0102 509.551500 516.648000 well see even that i think is a sort of uh a budget uh when you do that right right
sw2823A-ms98-a-0103 516.648000 524.925125 [silence]
sw2823A-ms98-a-0104 524.925125 526.233625 um-hum

sw2823A-ms98-a-0107 541.455000 550.515250 uh we pay for check or else we take out of ATM services you know a certain amount of money and i write every check down
sw2823A-ms98-a-0108 550.515250 559.387250 for the amount of money or whoever takes money out of the ATM i write down that amount of money and as it comes through uh o[n]- on the statement
sw2823A-ms98-a-0109 559.387250 571.649875 then i'll b[lock]- block it off in in a bright color so we know it's gone and i can see what's left out and what's left over to come through the statement to make sure that we don't overdraw ourselves or anything
sw2823A-ms98-a-0110 571.649875 577.025875 but uh that's the way i do it uh receipts were a big mess for me i can't do that
sw2823A-ms98-a-0111 577.025875 580.385750 that was just uh too much
sw2823A-ms98-a-0112 580.385750 582.840000 yeah i couldn't do that so
